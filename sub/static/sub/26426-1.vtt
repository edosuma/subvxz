- Good evening, madam.
- I'm here to meet someone, Adam Lucas.

03:17.154 --> 03:19.280
I don't believe he has arrived.

03:19.323 --> 03:21.199
Perhaps you'd like to look inside.

03:21.283 --> 03:23.284
I'm afraid I don't know
what he looks like.

03:23.327 --> 03:26.370
Ah, well, if you take a seat
at the bar or at your table,

03:26.455 --> 03:29.582
- I'll show him in when he arrives.
- My table will be fine.

03:29.625 --> 03:31.000
very well.

Excuse me.

04:54.001 --> 04:59.588
Could you ask that man who's sitting alone
over there if his name is Adam Lucas?

04:59.673 --> 05:01.841
Thank you.

05:20.902 --> 05:24.572
- I'm sorry, ma'am, no.
- Thank you very much.

05:52.476 --> 05:53.976
Taxi.

06:13.455 --> 06:16.207
That's enough for now.

06:16.291 --> 06:19.752
I'll get it. They're probably here
to pick up my angels.

06:26.134 --> 06:29.845
This is incredible, isn't it?

06:29.930 --> 06:32.723
I had a feeling
I knew you from somewhere.

06:32.808 --> 06:36.394
- I had a feeling.
- You did?

06:36.478 --> 06:40.481
Oh, I was bringing this
amphora in to be repaired.

06:42.025 --> 06:45.069
You don't remember,
but I was in here about a year ago.

06:45.153 --> 06:47.405
I brought in a mosaic,

06:47.489 --> 06:50.908
third century from Herculanium,
portrait of a young boy.

06:51.034 --> 06:54.662
There was another woman, dark-haired.
She worked on the piece.

06:54.746 --> 06:59.291
Charlotte, my partner.
I remember that mosaic.

06:59.334 --> 07:01.752
- She did a terrific job.
- Good.

07:01.837 --> 07:03.462
I'm Jack Saunders,

07:03.505 --> 07:05.798
curator of antiquities,
Founders Museum.

07:05.841 --> 07:08.759
Adrienne Davis.
I don't have a title.

07:10.178 --> 07:13.180
Well, it's nice to meet you finally.

07:13.265 --> 07:15.558
- Same.
- Adrienne, I'm leaving.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.228
- I'll lock up.
- See you tomorrow.

07:19.312 --> 07:22.356
- That's her.
- Let's have a look at that.

07:22.983 --> 07:26.318
We used to have
a house in Searsport, Maine.

07:26.361 --> 07:28.737
I had an aunt and uncle
who had a house...

07:28.822 --> 07:31.532
- not ten minutes from Searsport.
- You're kidding me.

07:31.575 --> 07:34.285
Me and my cousins used to go there,
swim all summer.

07:34.369 --> 07:35.369
Really?

07:35.412 --> 07:38.164
You and I were probably
there at the same time.

07:38.206 --> 07:40.708
Ever go to a place
called The Breakers?

07:40.750 --> 07:44.086
We used to try to sneak into The Breakers
to dance and listen to the music.

07:44.171 --> 07:47.131
- I can't believe this.
- What's your favorite song?

07:47.215 --> 07:48.591
Earth Angel.

08:20.874 --> 08:23.709

08:23.752 --> 08:27.505
Go on doing whatever
it was you were doing.

08:42.938 --> 08:46.190
Here's to Adam Lucas,
with deepest gratitude.

08:46.274 --> 08:50.277
- Who?
- Your blind date the other night.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.779
Oh.

08:59.162 --> 09:02.665
So, what are you doing tonight?

09:02.749 --> 09:06.168
I don't know.

09:06.211 --> 09:10.339
How about tomorrow night?

09:10.423 --> 09:12.883
I don't know.

09:13.885 --> 09:17.096
How about the rest of your life?

09:20.141 --> 09:23.352
Am I being too presumptuous?

09:25.313 --> 09:28.566
Well, that remains to be seen.

09:48.169 --> 09:51.130
Mommy, can I
blow out the candles now?

09:51.172 --> 09:54.800
- Hang on, honey.

Thank you, Daddy.

10:37.552 --> 10:42.556
My scariest purchase was $1.2 million
for an Etruscan urn.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.850
It was in perfect condition.

10:44.893 --> 10:48.604
It was so perfect,
they had doubts of its authenticity.

10:48.688 --> 10:52.024
We had five authenticators on that one.

10:52.067 --> 10:56.028
Best piece I ever purchased.

10:56.071 --> 10:59.031
That's enough business.
We have cake here.

11:02.869 --> 11:05.829
- Give me that! I want that.
- No, you don't!

11:08.208 --> 11:11.251
- No more nothing!
- No more nothing!

11:12.587 --> 11:13.629
It's me.

11:13.713 --> 11:16.965
The day you were born,
the happiest day of my life.

11:17.050 --> 11:18.592
Mine, too.

11:20.261 --> 11:23.055
Where's Granny and Papa?

11:23.098 --> 11:26.308
- Granny and Papa? You mean, mine?
- Yours.

11:26.393 --> 11:30.521
Okay, where are they?
Is that them?

11:30.605 --> 11:33.023
- That's not them.
- Is that them?

11:33.108 --> 11:36.110
That's not them, either.

11:36.736 --> 11:40.197
- That's them.
- Okay, here's a picture of me

11:40.281 --> 11:42.282
when I was a boy in Nebraska.

11:42.325 --> 11:45.327
Standing next to me
is Grandpapa Thomas.

11:45.370 --> 11:48.914
Standing next to him is
your grandmother, Lorraine.

11:48.957 --> 11:51.417
Over here is a bicycle I used to ride.

11:51.459 --> 11:53.460
- See that bike?
- Mm-hmm.

11:53.503 --> 11:55.754
Over here where you can't see...

11:55.839 --> 11:58.841
is a hill where we used
to go tobogganing.

11:58.883 --> 12:02.678
Tell me again
about granny's eyes.

12:02.762 --> 12:05.723
Granny's eyes were beautiful,
exactly like...

12:05.807 --> 12:08.767
- Exactly like mine.
- Right.

12:08.810 --> 12:11.687
Okay, time to go to sleep.

12:12.480 --> 12:16.358
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, sweetie.

12:23.825 --> 12:28.454
- You know what I'm thinking?
- What?

12:28.496 --> 12:31.290
How lucky I am.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.710
Lucky how?

12:36.171 --> 12:38.672
You don't know anything.

14:46.175 --> 14:48.427
Aaah!

14:49.804 --> 14:52.306
Aaah!

14:53.850 --> 14:58.520
Aaah!

15:00.273 --> 15:02.274
Aaah!

15:27.175 --> 15:29.718
You're more beautiful than she is.

15:29.802 --> 15:32.304
- Adrienne Saunders.
- Hey!

15:32.347 --> 15:34.389
- What are you wearing?
- A slip.

15:34.474 --> 15:36.892
- Your underwear?
- No! Do you like it?

15:36.976 --> 15:39.394
- You look great!
- Thanks.

15:39.479 --> 15:41.396
- Hi, Jack.
- Hi, Harvey.

15:41.481 --> 15:44.107
I was wondering
if you'd get around to me.

15:44.192 --> 15:46.902
I hate these things.
I'll see you later.

15:46.945 --> 15:49.738
You two should form a club.

15:52.241 --> 15:54.534
Oh, look at this.

15:54.577 --> 15:57.371
Pretty interesting.

15:58.373 --> 16:02.042
Jack, has the urn arrived?
It was supposed to come in yesterday.

16:02.085 --> 16:06.046
- I'm heartbroken to part with it.
- I'll tell you what.

16:06.089 --> 16:09.049
We're gonna give you special
visitation rights, okay?

16:09.092 --> 16:11.885
It's a very generous gift, Mrs. Peabody.

16:11.928 --> 16:14.304
- We're infinitely grateful.
- Good.

16:14.389 --> 16:17.391
- Where's Tomasz?
- I don't know. We just got here.

16:17.433 --> 16:20.060
If you see him, tell him
I want him to thank me too.

16:20.144 --> 16:22.437
I will.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.524
"Special visitation rights"?

16:25.566 --> 16:28.568
- You're so smooth, Jack.
- It takes practice.

16:28.653 --> 16:31.363
And who do you practice on? Me?

16:31.406 --> 16:33.907
Whenever I get the chance.

17:06.816 --> 17:09.943
Excuse me, Haw.
I'm gonna check on Mary.

17:09.986 --> 17:12.445
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.

17:15.366 --> 17:18.326
- Here.
- Thanks.

18:02.997 --> 18:04.081
' - Ooh!

18:10.630 --> 18:13.507
Aaah!

18:16.844 --> 18:20.180
Oh, my God!

18:28.689 --> 18:31.608
Did you sense any depression?

18:31.692 --> 18:34.402
Any mood swings?

18:34.445 --> 18:36.738
I saw him just this afternoon.

18:36.823 --> 18:39.366
He seemed fine.

18:39.450 --> 18:42.410
Maybe he was depressed
about his heart condition.

18:42.453 --> 18:44.538
He was taking a lot of pills.

18:44.622 --> 18:47.207
He was talking
about a fishing trip.

18:48.376 --> 18:50.669
- He was planning a trip.
- Yeah.

18:50.711 --> 18:54.214
He spoke to me about that
up in Connecticut.

18:55.591 --> 18:59.928
Mrs. Saunders, it would be best if you
would come down to the station tomorrow.

19:00.012 --> 19:02.973
We need you to sign a statement.

19:03.057 --> 19:04.724
Of course.

19:06.060 --> 19:08.103
What about the rest of us?

19:08.187 --> 19:10.188
That won't be necessary.

19:10.231 --> 19:13.191
We'll contact you
if we need anything more.

19:18.281 --> 19:20.574
Are you all right?

19:21.826 --> 19:25.245
- No.
- Are you okay?

19:25.705 --> 19:28.123
A cop tells you
to sign a statement,

19:28.207 --> 19:32.377
- and that's supposed to close the book?
- What do you expect?

19:32.420 --> 19:36.381
- They see hundreds of these a week.
- Well, I don't.

19:36.424 --> 19:41.052
- I think Tomasz deserved better than that.
- I know how you feel.

19:41.095 --> 19:45.932
I want to know why a guy
who's gonna commit suicide

19:45.975 --> 19:49.352
sets his watch
to take heart medication.

19:49.437 --> 19:51.438
Adrienne, they told you.

19:51.522 --> 19:53.356
The watch was probably preset.

19:53.441 --> 19:57.152
- He didn't even think about it.
- You're probably right.

19:59.113 --> 20:02.073
I need you to sign
this piece out, Jean.

20:02.116 --> 20:05.577
We're loaning it to the Corcoran
for their Egyptian exhibit.

20:05.620 --> 20:07.329
Thanks.

20:17.506 --> 20:19.174
Hmm.

20:31.520 --> 20:35.482
It looks like someone's
already run a test on this.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.451
I got your bath ready, sweetie.

20:46.494 --> 20:49.037
- Now take your clothes off.
- Okay.

20:49.121 --> 20:51.539
I'll be right back.

20:56.879 --> 21:00.090
- Hi.
- Hmm.

21:07.306 --> 21:10.100
What's the matter?

21:10.184 --> 21:13.979
They discovered a fake necklace...

21:14.021 --> 21:17.107
in the Egyptian collection
at the museum.

21:19.360 --> 21:23.655
$4.5 million, and I bought it.

21:24.657 --> 21:27.951
Who authenticated it?

21:28.035 --> 21:30.870
Harvey.

21:30.913 --> 21:33.540
Harvey authenticated it,
but it's my ass on the line.

21:33.582 --> 21:36.918
It's my career, my reputation.

21:37.753 --> 21:41.423
Damn, I know what I bought.
I know it was real.

21:42.591 --> 21:45.427
Somebody must've switched them.

21:45.511 --> 21:46.553
Tomasz.

21:47.972 --> 21:49.472
What?

21:49.557 --> 21:53.101
Maybe he was in trouble.
Maybe he needed money.

21:53.185 --> 21:56.062
Something could have happened.

21:57.898 --> 22:00.150
Honey...

22:00.234 --> 22:03.153
Tomasz was not a criminal.

22:05.823 --> 22:10.076
I'm trying to tell you,
everybody's going to be looking at me.

22:10.119 --> 22:12.537
They're all looking at me.

22:19.920 --> 22:22.130
- That's good, honey.
- Yeah.

22:22.214 --> 22:24.883
Let me get your back.

22:24.925 --> 22:27.093
- It's not too hot, is it?
- No.

22:30.222 --> 22:32.932
I'm sorry.

22:34.435 --> 22:37.687
I don't know what I'd do without you.

22:37.772 --> 22:40.440
You'd think of something.

22:45.279 --> 22:47.739
Who are you?

22:50.117 --> 22:53.286
You want me to make
you guys some dinner?

22:53.329 --> 22:53.953
Mm-hmm.

22:54.038 --> 22:58.124
What do you want?
Fried soapsuds?

22:58.167 --> 22:59.084
No.

23:01.003 --> 23:04.923
I love you. Thanks.

23:09.845 --> 23:13.515
Hello, Ernesto's?
I want to order take-out.

23:13.557 --> 23:15.600
Three chicken fricassees.

23:15.643 --> 23:17.852
Two rice and beans.
Do we have any coke?

23:17.937 --> 23:22.399
- Yep.
- No coke. I have another call.

23:22.483 --> 23:26.194
This is Jack Saunders.
I'll pick it up in ten minutes. Thanks.

23:26.237 --> 23:29.406
Hello? Yeah, this is me.

23:30.408 --> 23:32.700
Son of a bitch!

23:32.743 --> 23:35.453
I can't believe this.
Now, with every...

23:35.496 --> 23:38.665
All right. All right.

23:38.707 --> 23:42.460
I'll be there.
Okay, bye-bye.

23:44.797 --> 23:48.049
- I have to go to Boston.
- Boston?

23:48.092 --> 23:51.344
Of all the stupid times,
with everything that's going on.

23:52.138 --> 23:53.138
What is it?

23:53.180 --> 23:56.891
An auction. The Morgan Collection
is going on the block, 9 a.m.

23:56.976 --> 24:00.103
Under the circumstances,
I can hardly say no.

24:00.187 --> 24:03.857
- When do you have to leave?
- There's a 10:00 flight.

24:06.902 --> 24:09.237
Honey, could you get my gray suit?

24:09.321 --> 24:11.364
Okay.

24:12.199 --> 24:15.160
Do you need this stuff?

24:15.202 --> 24:16.911
What is it?

24:16.996 --> 24:19.914
American express receipt
and a business card.

24:19.957 --> 24:21.416
Whose'?

24:21.500 --> 24:23.918
- Daniel Sherman.
- Who's he?

24:24.003 --> 24:26.504
Beats me. There's a number on the back.

24:26.547 --> 24:29.090
- I don't know.
- Toss it.

24:29.175 --> 24:33.511
- Do you need a cab, honey?
- No, I'm gonna take the car.

24:35.514 --> 24:38.433
- You had a bad day, didn't you?
- Mmm.

24:43.230 --> 24:45.899
I love you.

24:45.941 --> 24:48.776
And I love you.

24:48.819 --> 24:51.321
Hurry home, honey.

25:23.812 --> 25:26.523
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's okay.

25:26.607 --> 25:27.774
Wow!

25:27.816 --> 25:30.318
Gonna draw straws to see
who gets to go up there.

25:30.361 --> 25:35.156
- I'd love to go up there.
- Was Jack gonna meet you here today?

25:35.199 --> 25:37.408
Nope, he's not here.

25:37.451 --> 25:39.869
I could've sworn
I saw him go into the lounge.

25:39.954 --> 25:42.872
- He's in Boston, back tomorrow.
- Weird.

25:42.957 --> 25:45.208
Adrienne, this is gonna be a lot of work.

25:45.292 --> 25:50.088
We gotta get those guys
with the scaffolding, like pronto.

26:19.285 --> 26:22.078
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh

26:22.162 --> 26:26.958
♪ Earth angel, Earth angel

26:27.001 --> 26:30.461
♪ Will you be mine

26:32.006 --> 26:34.257
Honey?

26:35.509 --> 26:38.469
I love it. It's great!

26:39.722 --> 26:43.141
You shouldn't have done this.

26:43.183 --> 26:45.685
Who says I did it for you?

26:47.521 --> 26:49.981
I should've known.

26:51.358 --> 26:55.278
The weirdest thing
happened to me yesterday.

26:55.362 --> 26:58.573
I was with Charlotte, scouting a job
at the Chesterfield Hotel,

26:58.657 --> 27:01.701
and, um, she said that...

27:01.744 --> 27:05.455
she could've sworn she saw you
going into the lounge there.

27:07.458 --> 27:11.294
Tell me the truth.
Were you in New York City yesterday?

27:14.465 --> 27:18.009
Are you having an affair?

27:18.052 --> 27:21.054
Am I having an affair
at the Chesterfield?

27:21.138 --> 27:23.765
Are you kidding?
They have rotten room service.

27:39.740 --> 27:42.742
You would think
by your sixth anniversary,

27:42.826 --> 27:44.952
you wouldn't have to wait for a table.

27:45.037 --> 27:47.789
By your 60th anniversary,
you don't have to wait.

27:47.831 --> 27:50.792
Of course. Let's have a toast anyway.

27:50.834 --> 27:53.127
Harvey, you're good at that.
Would you make a toast?

27:53.170 --> 27:56.005
No, I'm not feeling witty tonight.

27:56.090 --> 27:58.174
I'll make a toast. Here's the toast.

27:58.258 --> 28:00.843
With deepest gratitude to Adam Lucas.

28:04.765 --> 28:08.184
- Who's Adam Lucas?
- That is a very good story.

28:10.270 --> 28:13.064
I'm gonna see about our table.
I got some clout.

28:18.654 --> 28:22.281
- Tell me a joke, Harv.
- Life sucks.

28:22.324 --> 28:24.909
- What's the punch line?
- There isn't one.

28:24.952 --> 28:28.037
- What's the matter?
- Nothing in particular.

28:28.122 --> 28:30.623
Come on, you can tell me.

28:32.751 --> 28:38.047
I had to go to Tomasz's family
and ask for his bank statements.

28:38.132 --> 28:40.425
God, I felt like such a shit!

28:40.467 --> 28:43.177
What were you looking for?

28:43.262 --> 28:46.139
We traced the forgery
to a jeweler in Stuttgart,

28:46.181 --> 28:49.517
who said the necklace was made
for a guy named Daniel Sherman,

28:49.560 --> 28:53.312
who paid $10,000 in traveler's checks.

28:53.355 --> 28:56.566
- Daniel Sherman.
- I'm sure it's an alias.

28:56.650 --> 29:01.237
The point is, there was nothing
irregular in Tomasz's account.

29:01.321 --> 29:04.657
So, now we're all fair game.

29:05.743 --> 29:08.119
Table's ready.

29:19.339 --> 29:22.341
Listen, this is, uh...

29:25.387 --> 29:27.889
This is not what we agreed upon.

29:28.474 --> 29:30.725
No, because it's not...

29:34.021 --> 29:37.064
I told you this before,
that if this came up...

29:37.149 --> 29:39.817
What was...

29:40.861 --> 29:43.404
It's okay. It's no problem.

29:43.489 --> 29:45.615
Yeah, me too.

29:47.117 --> 29:50.077
See you soon. Bye-bye.

29:51.163 --> 29:54.707
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, yeah.

29:54.792 --> 29:56.876
I just realized...

29:56.960 --> 30:00.296
I had to make this long-distance
call to San Francisco,

30:00.380 --> 30:03.257
with the time difference and everything.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.510
It's okay now. It's fine.

30:05.552 --> 30:08.513
Are you all right?
Did I wake you up?

30:10.557 --> 30:13.476
Let's go back to bed.

30:20.317 --> 30:23.110
I'm coloring my bird purple.

30:23.195 --> 30:26.739
- Is he a magic bird?
- Maybe.

30:26.782 --> 30:30.827
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, Mommy.

30:30.911 --> 30:33.788
- Do you like my coloring?
- I love your coloring.

30:33.872 --> 30:36.958
- That's great. Color the trees.
- What color?

30:39.211 --> 30:41.963
- Hello?
- Is Mr. Jack Saunders there?

30:42.005 --> 30:43.798
He's not in.
Can I take a message?

30:43.841 --> 30:45.758
- What should I use?
- Green.

30:45.801 --> 30:47.468
This is vogue Lingerie.

30:47.553 --> 30:50.721
Mr. Saunders was here the other day
and left his credit card.

30:50.764 --> 30:54.267
Really? You calling from Boston?

30:54.351 --> 30:57.937
No, this is vogue Lingerie
on East 53rd Street...

30:58.021 --> 31:00.314
in Manhattan.

31:00.399 --> 31:04.569
- This is the Saunders residence?
- Yes, 'Ms.

31:04.611 --> 31:08.114
- You have the right number.
- Maybe he'd like to come pick it up.

31:08.198 --> 31:11.492
I'll tell him. Thank you.

31:51.491 --> 31:54.744
- I'm sorry. I didn't know you were in here.
- That's okay.

31:54.828 --> 31:58.039
I was just going through some old papers.

31:58.665 --> 32:00.791
I was getting his suits
for the cleaners,

32:00.834 --> 32:02.668
the ones he took to Boston.

32:02.711 --> 32:05.838
Leave those there
and we'll take them in tomorrow.

32:06.173 --> 32:08.090
- Okay.
- Thanks.

32:48.715 --> 32:52.468
What's going on?
What's all this?

32:52.552 --> 32:57.264
Um, I was just looking for something.

32:58.558 --> 33:00.142
What?

33:02.896 --> 33:06.107
I found this in your suit pocket,

33:08.068 --> 33:11.153
the one you wore to Boston.

33:11.238 --> 33:13.447
You didn't go to Boston.

33:13.532 --> 33:17.326
That was you at the Chesterfield hotel,
wasn't it?

33:19.329 --> 33:23.124
You found a piece of candy in
my suit pocket, a stupid little mint and...

33:24.126 --> 33:26.460
suddenly I'm a liar?

33:26.503 --> 33:29.880
You're accusing me of lying.
And what else?

33:29.923 --> 33:32.717
Of having an affair?

33:32.759 --> 33:35.219
Jesus Christ.

33:36.763 --> 33:39.473
I don't believe this.

33:42.144 --> 33:46.480
Do you have any idea how many
receptions I've been to at the Chesterfield?

33:47.649 --> 33:49.775
Do you have any idea at all?

33:53.321 --> 33:55.322
What else am I lying about, Adrienne?

33:56.366 --> 33:57.825
What else?

33:59.536 --> 34:01.912
What about my nightgown?

34:01.955 --> 34:03.164
What about it?

34:03.665 --> 34:06.667
The lady called
from the lingerie shop.

34:06.710 --> 34:09.503
You left your credit card there...

34:09.545 --> 34:13.090
on 53rd street, in New York.

34:14.842 --> 34:18.596
You told me that you bought it in Boston.

34:18.638 --> 34:23.391
No, I didn't. I never said that.
I never did.

34:23.476 --> 34:27.563
I simply decided to buy you a gift,
and stopped in Midtown...

34:27.647 --> 34:30.690
on my way home from the airport.

34:30.775 --> 34:33.069
What else, Adrienne?

34:35.822 --> 34:38.574
What about Daniel Sherman?

34:38.658 --> 34:40.618
Who?

34:40.659 --> 34:42.495
Daniel Sherman.

34:42.536 --> 34:45.539
You had his business card,
I found it in your suit pocket.

34:45.581 --> 34:49.210
Harvey said they traced the forgery
to a guy with the same name.

34:49.293 --> 34:51.712
Harvey Schwartz.

34:53.924 --> 34:57.718
I'm your husband and you're
listening to Harvey Schwartz.

34:57.803 --> 35:00.179
Do you have any idea
how many people

35:00.222 --> 35:02.723
hand me a business card in a day?

35:02.766 --> 35:05.142
Has it occurred to you...

35:05.185 --> 35:07.853
that Harvey Schwartz
is just as much a suspect...

35:07.938 --> 35:12.399
- in this thing as anybody else?
- Harvey?

35:12.484 --> 35:16.237
You sound so astonished
and yet you suspected me.

35:17.322 --> 35:18.572
I didn't suspect you.

35:18.657 --> 35:21.117
- Yes, you did, Adrienne.
- No, I didn't.

35:23.411 --> 35:25.746
You just did.

35:31.503 --> 35:33.671
Jack, wait a minute.

35:33.713 --> 35:36.215
Where are you going?

35:38.051 --> 35:39.426
I don't know.

35:39.511 --> 35:41.887
Jack, please. Come on.

35:41.930 --> 35:44.306
Let's talk about this.
Honey, don't go.

35:44.391 --> 35:48.102
I can't talk to you.
You wouldn't understand.

35:48.186 --> 35:49.895
Daddy!

35:49.938 --> 35:52.439
Hi, sweetie.
I'll be back, okay?

35:52.524 --> 35:56.235
All right? You be with Mommy.

37:06.514 --> 37:09.183
Been waitin' long?

37:35.210 --> 37:37.962
Mommy, can I paint the roses too?

37:38.004 --> 37:41.215
- Yes. Go get some brushes.
- Okay.

39:57.227 --> 40:00.062
I found a great Italian deli.

40:01.314 --> 40:04.650
- I'll get it.
- Maybe it's Daddy.

40:04.692 --> 40:06.693
Maybe it is.

40:13.159 --> 40:16.245
Good evening, ma'am.
Are you Mrs. Adrienne Saunders?

40:17.497 --> 40:19.998
Yes, I am.

40:41.896 --> 40:43.772
Mr. Dagota?

40:46.693 --> 40:50.904
Your son's personal effects.

40:50.947 --> 40:54.366
I'll need you to sign for them.

40:59.289 --> 41:01.707
Mrs. Saunders.

41:02.750 --> 41:05.794
Mrs. Saunders?

41:06.296 --> 41:10.132
I'll need your signature
on this identification form...

41:10.550 --> 41:14.595
to verify that these are
your husband's personal effects.

41:22.270 --> 41:24.480
Yes...

41:24.564 --> 41:26.773
these are.

42:20.662 --> 42:24.081
Everything feels so wrong.

42:25.375 --> 42:27.292
So strange.

42:30.088 --> 42:33.340
What am I gonna do
with all his clothes?

42:35.134 --> 42:37.886
I just bought him some new shirts.

42:37.971 --> 42:41.848
You just have to wait it out, I guess.

42:43.560 --> 42:45.936
I mean, that's all you can do.

42:53.653 --> 42:56.613
And remember, you always have me.

42:56.656 --> 43:00.325
So if you really need
a change of space...

43:44.203 --> 43:47.497
Granny said Daddy was in heaven.

43:47.540 --> 43:50.292
Do you think he's in heaven?

43:50.376 --> 43:53.920
Is he with his Granny and Papa?

43:54.547 --> 43:57.466
I think so, sweetheart.

43:59.093 --> 44:02.220
But he didn't even say goodbye.

44:04.432 --> 44:06.642
I know, honey.

44:06.726 --> 44:10.437
But because of you,
Daddy's gonna go on forever.

44:19.072 --> 44:24.326
Go get your coat on, honey.
Take your toast with you.

44:24.410 --> 44:25.869
Okay-

44:25.912 --> 44:28.413
- Hi.
- Hi.

44:28.498 --> 44:30.457
I'm sorry. The house is a mess.

44:30.500 --> 44:33.585
I'll have it together by
the time you get home.

44:33.628 --> 44:34.711
Thanks.

44:34.754 --> 44:38.006
Bye! See you outside
school at 1:00.

46:11.309 --> 46:16.104
- How are you doin'?
- I'll be okay.

46:16.189 --> 46:20.400
Adrienne, it's for you.
Someone from the Social Security Office.

46:20.485 --> 46:22.527
- Do you want to take it?
- Yeah.

46:27.533 --> 46:32.078
Hello?
Yes, this is Mrs. Saunders.

46:35.792 --> 46:38.960
I don't understand what
you're trying to say to me.

46:39.045 --> 46:43.381
We really can't release
these benefits without further approval.

46:43.424 --> 46:45.759
I don't know what you mean.

46:45.802 --> 46:49.346
The contributions were made.
I supplied you with the death certificate.

46:49.388 --> 46:52.432
We don't doubt that
your husband's dead.

46:52.517 --> 46:55.519
Nor are we saying that the
contributions weren't made.

46:55.561 --> 46:58.188
They were made with the wrong
social security number.

46:58.272 --> 47:01.024
The I.R.S. screwed up
when they didn't catch it.

47:01.067 --> 47:03.693
Your office applied
the contributions

47:03.736 --> 47:06.863
- to the wrong social security number?
- No.

47:06.906 --> 47:10.116
Maybe you'd like to have somebody here.
Do you have a lawyer?

47:10.201 --> 47:14.704
- What the hell are you telling me?
- I'm sorry.

47:14.747 --> 47:18.708
I just don't quite know
how to say this.

47:23.130 --> 47:26.132
The man with the
social security number...

47:26.217 --> 47:29.678
that your husband
claimed was his, died...

47:29.762 --> 47:32.639
16 years ago...

47:32.723 --> 47:35.350
in Sommerville, Nebraska.

47:37.478 --> 47:41.398
We don't know who
your husband was,

47:42.525 --> 47:47.028
but we definitely know
he was not this Jack Saunders.

47:47.947 --> 47:50.407
I don't understand.

47:50.449 --> 47:52.784
This couldn't be.

47:52.827 --> 47:55.954
If you want to talk
to my superiors...

47:56.038 --> 47:58.582
That's fine.
They'll tell you the same thing.

47:58.624 --> 48:02.502
Your husband used a social security card
that didn't belong to him.

50:26.355 --> 50:30.817
Can we play with these?

50:30.860 --> 50:33.361
Yes, sweetie, you can.

50:37.033 --> 50:40.952
This one will
look good on me.

50:45.916 --> 50:49.878
Are you sure your mother
will let me have this?

50:55.384 --> 50:57.677
Can I take these too?

50:57.762 --> 50:59.012
Mm-hmm.

50:59.096 --> 51:01.014
And this?

51:03.476 --> 51:05.935
Mm-hmm.

51:09.523 --> 51:12.525
- Carol, it's time to go.
- Can I take what I'm wearing?

51:12.568 --> 51:15.612
Yes, but it's time to go.

52:17.424 --> 52:19.926
Since the school
system decentralized,

52:20.010 --> 52:22.846
we've had to store school
records for the whole area.

52:22.888 --> 52:26.850
We're a little casual with the yearbooks.
Not enough space.

52:28.853 --> 52:31.771
This whole row is James Garfield High.

52:31.856 --> 52:35.275
If there are any yearbooks,
they'd be at the other end.

52:35.359 --> 52:38.069
I know the files are at this end.

52:46.203 --> 52:49.080
James Garfield.

52:54.628 --> 52:57.130
It would be here.

53:18.110 --> 53:22.071
I don't know why they can't keep these
in alphabetical order.

53:22.114 --> 53:24.657
Excuse me.

53:25.743 --> 53:28.036
Instead of the records
for Jack Saunders,

53:28.120 --> 53:31.206
could I see the records
for one of his classmates?

53:31.290 --> 53:33.666
I can't do that, Mrs. Saunders.

53:33.751 --> 53:37.837
The records are only public information
if the person is deceased.

53:37.922 --> 53:39.881
This man is dead.

53:39.965 --> 53:43.843
I can't prove it,
but I know that he's dead.

53:43.886 --> 53:47.680
Please, I have to know
who this man is.

53:47.765 --> 53:49.807
Oh, to hell with it.

53:49.850 --> 53:51.476
Who is it?

53:51.518 --> 53:54.187
Frank Sullivan.

54:05.157 --> 54:08.993
Well, I found Jack Saunders.
The last one in my stack.

54:09.036 --> 54:12.455
- Isn't it always like that?
- No Frank Sullivan?

54:12.498 --> 54:14.707
Nope, and I was very thorough.

54:14.792 --> 54:19.045
- You don't have it, either?
- I've got a few more to go here.

54:19.964 --> 54:22.674
Nope.

54:22.716 --> 54:25.843
No, I don't have it.

54:25.886 --> 54:29.973
Can I have Jack Saunders' file?

54:30.015 --> 54:32.183
You never know.

54:32.226 --> 54:35.853
True, you never do.

54:35.896 --> 54:38.898
Thank you.

57:44.126 --> 57:45.585
Yes?

57:45.669 --> 57:47.920
I hope I'm not bothering you,

57:48.005 --> 57:50.715
but I'm looking for
a relative of Jack Saunders.

57:50.757 --> 57:55.428
- Jack Saunders died 15 years ago.
- I know that.

57:55.512 --> 57:57.805
I know this may sound strange,

57:57.890 --> 58:00.099
but I'm trying to track down

58:00.184 --> 58:03.811
a friend of his, Frank Sullivan.

58:03.896 --> 58:08.107
Um... come in.

58:08.150 --> 58:11.235
Jack was my cousin.

58:11.278 --> 58:13.905
Frank was his best friend.

58:13.947 --> 58:16.407
In fact, Jack was Frank's only friend.

58:17.493 --> 58:20.536
They were inseparable, like one person.

58:21.788 --> 58:25.249
It was odd. I couldn't imagine two
more different people.

58:26.418 --> 58:29.921
Frank was so quiet...

58:29.963 --> 58:33.966
and Jack was the most outgoing,
charming person you ever met.

58:34.051 --> 58:37.220
Frank wasn't polished like that,

58:37.262 --> 58:41.557
but he had an unspoken charm.

58:42.851 --> 58:46.771
- He was special.
- How about his parents?

58:46.813 --> 58:50.733
- Are they still around?
- Oh, god. I don't know.

58:50.776 --> 58:53.152
I think his father died.

58:54.404 --> 58:57.698
I don't remember. It was a long time ago.

58:57.783 --> 59:00.409
Frank didn't talk about his family much.

59:00.452 --> 59:04.413
They were poor.
His father was an alcoholic.

59:05.249 --> 59:09.168
His mother worked for
the highway department in a tollbooth.

59:09.211 --> 59:11.671
Frank was embarrassed about that.

59:12.673 --> 59:15.299
He'd never take me to his home.

59:15.384 --> 59:17.635
What about his family?

59:17.678 --> 59:21.389
- Did he have any sisters or brothers?
- No, he didn't have anybody.

59:22.015 --> 59:24.559
We were like his family.

59:25.644 --> 59:28.646
God, those were great days for me.

59:28.730 --> 59:33.484
I was at a point in life where I
didn't have any direction.

59:33.527 --> 59:38.155
And Frank, he would just sit
with me for hours, talking.

59:38.240 --> 59:42.159
One night we went to
a coffee shop for dinner...

59:42.202 --> 59:45.371
and we talked right
through to the morning.

59:45.455 --> 59:47.164
We were still talking

59:47.207 --> 59:51.168
when they asked us what
we wanted for breakfast.

59:51.253 --> 59:54.630
That's when I decided to go back to school.

01:00:05.392 --> 01:00:07.393
Um...

01:00:07.477 --> 01:00:10.396
after Jack died, he kind of disappeared.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.690
I never saw him again.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.071
Sounds like he meant a lot to you.

01:00:21.408 --> 01:00:24.619
Well, what can I tell you?
Excuse me.

01:00:31.126 --> 01:00:34.086
- There you go, Mom.
- Thank you. That looks great.

01:00:35.213 --> 01:00:37.298
What would I do without you?

01:00:42.387 --> 01:00:45.097
Gee, I wish I could be more help,

01:00:45.182 --> 01:00:48.100
but I don't remember much.

01:00:48.185 --> 01:00:51.812
I put it out of my mind a long time ago.

01:00:53.065 --> 01:00:55.775
Still, if you give me your phone number,

01:00:55.817 --> 01:00:59.528
- maybe things will come back a bit.
- Thank you.

01:00:59.571 --> 01:01:01.030
This has been a real shock,

01:01:01.073 --> 01:01:03.741
like out of nowhere,
if you know what I mean.

01:01:08.497 --> 01:01:10.456
Anyway,

01:01:10.499 --> 01:01:14.585
if you ever find him, tell him I said hi.

01:01:30.727 --> 01:01:33.479
Mary, have you been going
through my drawers?

01:01:33.563 --> 01:01:34.939
No.

01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:43.864
Are you sure? It's awful messed up.

01:01:43.949 --> 01:01:46.409
I didn't do it, mom.

01:01:46.451 --> 01:01:49.286
If you want to play with my things,

01:01:49.329 --> 01:01:52.164
- Ask my permission.
- Okay.

01:01:55.377 --> 01:01:58.921
- Hello?
- This is Evelyn Saunders.

01:01:58.964 --> 01:02:02.842
Are you the woman I spoke with
about Frank Sullivan?

01:02:02.884 --> 01:02:06.637
- Yes, this is Adrienne.
- Good. I'm glad.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.889
I remembered something last night...

01:02:08.974 --> 01:02:11.308
middle of the night, I could barely sleep.

01:02:11.351 --> 01:02:15.479
His mother lives on Carpenter Place...

01:02:15.522 --> 01:02:17.565
beside a deli.

01:02:17.649 --> 01:02:22.570
Don't ask how I remembered.
It just came back.

01:02:42.924 --> 01:02:46.886
Could you wait?
I'm going to go in for a minute.

01:03:10.118 --> 01:03:14.288
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Sullivan?

01:03:18.919 --> 01:03:21.545
My name is Adrienne Saunders.

01:03:21.588 --> 01:03:24.799
I believe that I was married to your son.

01:03:28.303 --> 01:03:31.263
All these years I thought he was dead.

01:03:31.306 --> 01:03:36.185
Now I find out he's been living
in the same city with a wife and a kid.

01:03:39.856 --> 01:03:43.943
A decent person would have
found out how his mother was:

01:03:44.027 --> 01:03:49.532
If she needed anything,
like cigarettes or booze.

01:03:49.574 --> 01:03:52.576
Not him.

01:03:53.578 --> 01:03:57.581
- What do you call her?
- Mary.

01:03:58.583 --> 01:04:00.084
Mary.

01:04:02.587 --> 01:04:06.966
She has my eyes, you know that?

01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:10.344
People always said I had beautiful eyes.

01:04:10.428 --> 01:04:14.473
- He always used to say that about you.
- A lot of good it did me.

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:19.770
Jack Saunders.

01:04:19.813 --> 01:04:22.815
What a joke!

01:04:22.899 --> 01:04:25.943
Jack would never have treated his family

01:04:26.027 --> 01:04:28.654
the way Frank treated me.

01:04:28.738 --> 01:04:32.449
Having him ruined my life.

01:04:34.494 --> 01:04:36.495
Why did you marry him?

01:04:38.999 --> 01:04:41.000
Because I loved him.

01:04:42.502 --> 01:04:45.796
I don't wanna hear this.

01:04:48.466 --> 01:04:52.553
He was dead... the day he left here.

01:04:52.637 --> 01:04:55.681
Doesn't matter to me
that he died a month ago.

01:04:55.765 --> 01:04:59.810
He was already dead.

01:05:02.147 --> 01:05:05.441
He was a selfish child...

01:05:05.483 --> 01:05:08.485
and he was a selfish man.

01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:11.530
People change, Mrs. Sullivan,

01:05:11.573 --> 01:05:15.075
especially when they're loved.

01:05:16.286 --> 01:05:18.245
Excuse me.

01:05:44.314 --> 01:05:48.525
I'm leaving my card in case
you ever need anything.

01:05:48.568 --> 01:05:50.986
You know where to reach me.

01:06:36.199 --> 01:06:39.159
- Mommy!
- Huh? What, honey?

01:06:39.244 --> 01:06:42.121
There's a man in my room.

01:06:42.205 --> 01:06:44.498
- What?
- I saw him.

01:06:44.582 --> 01:06:48.085
There's not a man in your room, sweetie.

01:06:48.128 --> 01:06:51.839
- But I saw him.
- Come here.

01:06:51.923 --> 01:06:56.301
Listen, do you remember you
had that dream last week?

01:06:56.344 --> 01:06:59.847
He was the same man. He was real.

01:06:59.931 --> 01:07:03.392
- He was in my room looking at me.
- Okay.

01:07:03.435 --> 01:07:05.853
- Come on.
- All right, let's go.

01:07:15.238 --> 01:07:17.197
What's that?

01:07:17.282 --> 01:07:20.534
Shadows... just shadows.

01:07:20.618 --> 01:07:22.578
Okay-

01:07:26.207 --> 01:07:29.585
Oh, darn it.

01:07:32.047 --> 01:07:34.006
Oh!

01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:37.468
You're funny, Mommy.

01:07:38.636 --> 01:07:41.305
There, you see? There's nobody here.

01:07:41.347 --> 01:07:43.849
He was standing there.

01:07:43.892 --> 01:07:47.269
There's nobody now, is there?

01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:07.581
There.

01:08:07.665 --> 01:08:10.417
Everything's going to be okay now.

01:08:10.502 --> 01:08:13.837
- Thank you, Mommy.
- You wanna sleep with me?

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:17.006
Yeah. Can I bring Julia?

01:08:17.091 --> 01:08:20.676
Yes. I'll get her.

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:08.113
Hey, who let the cat out?

01:12:14.746 --> 01:12:16.788
Lillian?

01:12:24.839 --> 01:12:26.715
Mary?

01:12:29.218 --> 01:12:31.928
Mary?

01:12:38.436 --> 01:12:40.437
Lillian!

01:12:44.692 --> 01:12:46.735
Mary!

01:13:05.296 --> 01:13:09.091
Oh, no! Oh, my god!

01:13:09.133 --> 01:13:13.553
Oh, my god. Oh, Lillian.

01:13:13.638 --> 01:13:16.014
Oh, Jesus. Lillian.

01:13:17.517 --> 01:13:20.394
Help, somebody!

01:13:20.478 --> 01:13:22.854
Oh, Jesus.

01:13:29.821 --> 01:13:31.780
Mary. Oh, Jesus.

01:13:31.823 --> 01:13:34.199
Mary, Mary-

01:13:34.283 --> 01:13:36.201
Oh, my god.

01:13:39.914 --> 01:13:41.957
Mommy, what's going on?

01:13:41.999 --> 01:13:44.209
There's been an accident. Come on.

01:13:44.293 --> 01:13:47.337
- What's going on?
- We have to make a phone call.

01:13:55.972 --> 01:13:59.850
Okay. All right.

01:13:59.892 --> 01:14:02.018
We'll call back in the morning.

01:14:02.103 --> 01:14:04.646
Thanks, doctor.

01:14:10.862 --> 01:14:14.322
- She's gonna be okay.
- Thank god.

01:14:14.365 --> 01:14:17.033
- Let's go. Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

01:14:17.076 --> 01:14:19.828
Let's go get Mary.

01:14:33.384 --> 01:14:37.596
I love you, sweetie. Sleep tight.

01:14:50.568 --> 01:14:52.819
What if Mary had been in the apartment?

01:14:52.904 --> 01:14:56.281
It could have been Mary.

01:14:57.742 --> 01:15:00.410
Harvey?
' Hmm?

01:15:00.453 --> 01:15:03.788
I'm gonna ask the police
to reinvestigate Jack's death.

01:15:03.873 --> 01:15:08.793
I know there's a connection
between all these things.

01:15:13.299 --> 01:15:15.800
I think you outta try to get some sleep.

01:15:15.843 --> 01:15:19.679
We'll talk about it in the morning.

01:15:19.764 --> 01:15:23.934
- I can't stop thinking about Jack.
- I know.

01:15:25.937 --> 01:15:30.732
You should have seen the way he lived,
the way he grew up.

01:15:33.277 --> 01:15:37.322
I didn't even know who he was.

01:15:39.575 --> 01:15:43.453
Everything I believed in was a lie.

01:16:04.725 --> 01:16:07.477
- Hi, Ellen.
- Good morning.

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:12.274
You have a message.
Someone calling for a Rosalie Sullivan.

01:16:12.316 --> 01:16:15.735
She said it was urgent,
needs to see you right away.

01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:20.031
- Don't you need the address?
- Got it.

01:16:32.378 --> 01:16:34.796
Mrs. Sullivan?

01:16:41.137 --> 01:16:44.639
Mrs. Sullivan, are you here?

01:17:06.037 --> 01:17:08.246
Mrs. Sullivan?

01:17:20.843 --> 01:17:22.761
Mrs. Sullivan?

01:18:22.655 --> 01:18:26.366
You bastard! You bastard!

01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:28.827
- Why did you do this to me?
- Let me talk to you.

01:18:28.911 --> 01:18:31.413
- No. I hate you.
- Let me talk to you.

01:18:31.455 --> 01:18:35.667
Listen to me. Let me talk to you.

01:18:35.751 --> 01:18:37.877
Let me talk, okay?

01:18:37.962 --> 01:18:40.964
No!

01:18:46.137 --> 01:18:49.556
Jack was my only friend.

01:18:51.726 --> 01:18:56.187
When I couldn't afford to go to college,
he educated me.

01:18:56.272 --> 01:18:58.523
He, uh...

01:18:58.566 --> 01:19:01.151
he told me what books to read.

01:19:01.235 --> 01:19:03.403
He took me to the Metropolitan,
to the Frick.

01:19:03.487 --> 01:19:08.032
He was everything I ever wanted to be.

01:19:09.493 --> 01:19:12.370
The night he died...

01:19:12.455 --> 01:19:16.416
it was, uh...

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.877
It was a dream,

01:19:18.919 --> 01:19:21.379
a nightmare.

01:19:26.469 --> 01:19:28.887
I just became him.

01:19:31.056 --> 01:19:33.683
I was the one who cleaned out
his apartment, his papers,

01:19:33.726 --> 01:19:37.228
his degree, his passport.

01:19:37.313 --> 01:19:40.190
Everything was there. I just took it.

01:19:40.232 --> 01:19:43.610
It didn't seem like a lie. It seemed real.

01:19:43.694 --> 01:19:47.071
Everybody believed me.
I had all the credentials.

01:19:48.824 --> 01:19:55.747
And after a while, I believed it myself
until one day a man appeared at my office,

01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:58.208
Daniel Sherman.

01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:01.085
Yeah.

01:20:01.128 --> 01:20:05.006
He knew me when we were kids.

01:20:05.049 --> 01:20:07.425
He knew Frank Sullivan.

01:20:08.552 --> 01:20:11.763
He wanted money... a lot of money.

01:20:11.847 --> 01:20:16.559
He made forgeries and I had to switch
them for the originals.

01:20:16.602 --> 01:20:20.939
- Who did I bury?
- You buried a hitchhiker.

01:20:21.023 --> 01:20:25.068
He was killed in the crash.
His neck was broken.

01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:28.947
- Oh, god.
- He was my way out.

01:20:28.989 --> 01:20:31.282
I thought that if I could disappear,

01:20:31.325 --> 01:20:34.035
I could protect you and Mary.

01:20:34.078 --> 01:20:41.251
Being dead was the price
I had to pay to keep you safe.

01:20:41.293 --> 01:20:44.754
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:49.968
I thought of telling you
a thousand, thousand times.

01:20:50.052 --> 01:20:54.013
But I could not bear to have
you think of me this way.

01:20:54.849 --> 01:20:56.683
Or Mary.

01:20:58.435 --> 01:21:01.020
I wanted her to remember me from the...

01:21:01.105 --> 01:21:04.983
pictures in that stupid photo album.

01:21:07.027 --> 01:21:10.613
Adrienne, I need your help.

01:21:11.782 --> 01:21:16.160
I didn't give Sherman one of the pieces,
an Egyptian necklace.

01:21:16.245 --> 01:21:19.539
It must be in the loft.
I need you to find it.

01:21:19.623 --> 01:21:23.334
I know this man. He is a killer.

01:21:23.377 --> 01:21:25.336
He killed Tomasz.

01:21:25.421 --> 01:21:30.049
We have to find this necklace and give it

01:21:30.134 --> 01:21:32.927
to this Sherman and...

01:21:34.305 --> 01:21:36.931
until we do, you're not gonna be safe

01:21:36.974 --> 01:21:39.851
and Mary's not gonna be safe.

01:21:44.148 --> 01:21:46.107
Adrienne,

01:21:47.943 --> 01:21:50.987
I don't expect any sympathy from you.

01:21:51.822 --> 01:21:55.199
I never wanted to do this to you.

01:21:57.286 --> 01:21:59.662
But I thought I had no choice.

01:22:02.166 --> 01:22:05.877
I'm a dead man now.

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.922
I'll never see Mary again...

01:22:09.006 --> 01:22:12.133
and I'll never be with you again.

01:24:01.368 --> 01:24:05.121
- Hello?
- Hi. It's me.

01:24:06.665 --> 01:24:09.375
I'm calling because I was worried

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:12.795
about you going
back there and being alone.

01:24:12.838 --> 01:24:16.257
I was wondering if I
shouldn't be there with you?

01:24:18.886 --> 01:24:20.344
No.

01:24:21.930 --> 01:24:25.058
Okay, I understand.

01:24:25.142 --> 01:24:27.852
That's not the only reason I was calling.

01:24:27.895 --> 01:24:32.231
After seeing you I...

01:24:32.316 --> 01:24:35.026
I realized how much I still love you.

01:24:36.153 --> 01:24:40.281
And how sorry I am for all the lies.

01:24:40.324 --> 01:24:42.867
For all of it.

01:24:49.249 --> 01:24:53.586
I don't blame you for not answering.

01:24:54.505 --> 01:24:57.006
I don't blame you at all.

01:24:58.717 --> 01:25:02.053
Call me tomorrow.

01:25:02.137 --> 01:25:04.388
Give me until then, okay?

01:25:05.808 --> 01:25:07.683
All right.

01:25:07.726 --> 01:25:09.852
Okay. Yeah.

01:25:10.979 --> 01:25:12.438
Bye. Bye.

01:26:10.164 --> 01:26:13.207
Daddy.

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:29.974
- Number 23, was it?
- Yes.

01:26:30.017 --> 01:26:31.976
Right there.

01:26:38.775 --> 01:26:40.651
- Could you wait here?
- Sure.

01:26:40.694 --> 01:26:42.653
Thank you.

01:26:47.242 --> 01:26:50.912
I'm on the phone. Come on in.

01:27:06.053 --> 01:27:10.014
Baby's fine. I felt him kicking.

01:27:11.975 --> 01:27:16.020
No, I'm doing fine.

01:28:07.364 --> 01:28:10.032
Hold on, there's someone here.
Can I help you?

01:28:13.495 --> 01:28:16.831
- Mrs. Sherman?
- Yes.

01:28:16.873 --> 01:28:20.376
Sorry. I thought you were the packers.
Calm down, Jack!

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:23.087
Go on.

01:28:23.171 --> 01:28:25.923
In spite of his size, he's still a puppy.

01:28:25.966 --> 01:28:30.303
- What can I do for you?
- This picture, where did you get it?

01:28:30.387 --> 01:28:32.888
Would you mind telling me what you want?

01:28:32.931 --> 01:28:35.016
Where did you get this picture?

01:28:37.352 --> 01:28:40.229
It's my husband's sister.
She died in a plane crash.

01:28:41.982 --> 01:28:43.274
What is all...

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:48.321
Listen, uh... yeah.

01:28:48.405 --> 01:28:51.365
Blonde, yeah.

01:28:57.122 --> 01:29:00.750
My husband wants to talk to you.

01:29:04.963 --> 01:29:07.590
- Yes.
- So you found us.

01:29:07.674 --> 01:29:09.675
That's pretty amazing.

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:13.763
I never expected this.
This complicates everything.

01:29:13.805 --> 01:29:17.767
Now, listen to me. I have Mary.

01:29:17.809 --> 01:29:22.646
Mary's with me. Don't worry.
She's not gonna get hurt.

01:29:22.731 --> 01:29:25.816
I need you to get that necklace, Adrienne.

01:29:25.901 --> 01:29:28.361
Mary said she traded it
with her friend, Carol.

01:29:28.403 --> 01:29:30.029
Since I can't go to the Gingolds,

01:29:30.113 --> 01:29:33.699
I thought it'd be good if you contact them
and try to get it back.

01:29:33.784 --> 01:29:36.660
We can meet tonight at the loft.

01:29:36.745 --> 01:29:39.663
I can handle things from there.

01:29:39.706 --> 01:29:44.668
I wouldn't say anything to the police
or Cathy, if I were you.

01:29:44.753 --> 01:29:48.464
It might complicate things
more than they already are.

01:29:48.507 --> 01:29:50.007
Want to say hello to Mary?

01:29:50.092 --> 01:29:52.593
- Here.
- Mommy?

01:29:53.053 --> 01:29:56.097
Mommy, daddy's here. He's really here.

01:29:58.225 --> 01:30:01.018
Nine o'clock, okay?
Say bye-bye to Mommy.

01:30:01.061 --> 01:30:03.354
- Bye-bye, Mommy.
- Bye-bye, Mommy.

01:30:05.148 --> 01:30:06.690
Okay, let's go.

01:30:25.794 --> 01:30:28.504
Watch out.

01:30:32.008 --> 01:30:36.887
I understand, but it isn't the best time.
We have guests.

01:30:36.972 --> 01:30:40.724
I apologize. I wouldn't
bother you normally...

01:30:40.767 --> 01:30:43.310
but I have to have that necklace tonight.

01:30:43.353 --> 01:30:45.771
No, she said I could have this!

01:30:45.856 --> 01:30:49.066
I know, but the necklace isn't a toy.

01:30:49.109 --> 01:30:51.944
Daddy!

01:30:53.321 --> 01:30:57.992
She said I could have it
and now she wants it back.

01:30:58.034 --> 01:31:00.703
This is confusing for Carol.

01:31:00.745 --> 01:31:06.375
I'm sure it is, but this happens to be
a valuable piece of jewelry.

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:09.879
I know how you feel. It's very confusing

01:31:09.921 --> 01:31:11.922
when grown-ups do things that aren't fair.

01:31:13.383 --> 01:31:15.593
These things happen in life.

01:31:15.677 --> 01:31:19.722
For Christ's sake. Isn't anybody
in charge around here?

01:33:11.459 --> 01:33:15.087
We forgot about you, didn't we?

01:33:24.389 --> 01:33:27.641
Do you have it?

01:33:31.730 --> 01:33:36.066
- Where's my daughter?
- She's fine.

01:33:39.029 --> 01:33:42.448
She's playing with her coloring books.

01:33:42.532 --> 01:33:45.242
She's in the car.

01:33:46.828 --> 01:33:48.871
I wanna go see her.

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:52.082
Oh!

01:33:56.046 --> 01:33:58.255
I don't know who you are.

01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:02.009
Sure you do. I'm your husband.

01:34:03.345 --> 01:34:06.972
Wasn't I a good husband?
Didn't I make you happy?

01:34:09.142 --> 01:34:11.226
Didn't you feel understood?

01:34:13.063 --> 01:34:15.356
Didn't you feel loved?

01:34:18.443 --> 01:34:21.320
Isn't that what it's all about?

01:34:23.615 --> 01:34:25.324
You're sick.

01:34:28.161 --> 01:34:30.162
I wanna get Mary.

01:34:35.502 --> 01:34:40.464
You love me. Now give me the necklace.

01:34:40.507 --> 01:34:43.634
Or what?

01:34:43.718 --> 01:34:47.221
You gonna kill me too?

01:34:47.263 --> 01:34:50.099
No.

01:34:50.141 --> 01:34:52.726
I'm gonna kiss you.

01:34:56.606 --> 01:35:01.068
I don't wanna hurt you,
but I will if I have to.

01:35:02.237 --> 01:35:04.822
That's love, too.

01:35:15.792 --> 01:35:19.795
You still love me, don't you?

01:35:20.588 --> 01:35:22.923
Yes.

01:35:49.784 --> 01:35:52.578
Agh!

01:36:01.546 --> 01:36:04.548
Adrienne?

01:36:07.135 --> 01:36:09.803
Adrienne!

01:36:14.309 --> 01:36:19.229
Oh... come on.

01:39:50.024 --> 01:39:54.236
Adrienne? Adrienne!

01:40:41.034 --> 01:40:44.244
Hi.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.543
There's no place to go now, Adrienne.

01:41:02.638 --> 01:41:04.639
Now there's nowhere to hide.

01:41:06.309 --> 01:41:09.227
I don't wanna hurt you, Adrienne.

01:41:11.022 --> 01:41:14.024
I never wanted to hurt anybody!

01:41:18.488 --> 01:41:21.823
But when I have to do something, I do it.

01:41:23.159 --> 01:41:26.161
I always do whatever comes next...

01:41:26.245 --> 01:41:30.040
no matter how difficult it is.

01:41:35.713 --> 01:41:39.216
If I have to do something, then I do it.

01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:42.886
I always do whatever comes next...

01:41:42.970 --> 01:41:48.225
no matter how difficult it is!

01:42:01.489 --> 01:42:03.365
Now...

01:42:03.407 --> 01:42:07.994
give me the necklace, Adrienne.

01:42:10.414 --> 01:42:12.624
Here.

01:42:16.546 --> 01:42:18.505
Take it.

01:42:32.895 --> 01:42:37.816
Uh. Ahhh!

01:44:25.341 --> 01:44:28.301
We forgot this, Mommy.

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:39.813
Why don't you put this in your suitcase.

01:44:41.357 --> 01:44:43.316
Okay-
