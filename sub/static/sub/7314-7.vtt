00:03.293 --> 00:04.928
Joe!
Torres!

00:04.930 --> 00:06.596
They took Lieutenant Torres,
and I have to get him back.

00:06.598 --> 00:08.031
He's dead.

00:08.032 --> 00:09.766
Where can I find my brother, sir?
You shut up, Evan!

00:09.768 --> 00:11.968
McGEE: Randall Kersey.
They followed him, boss.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.187
I pushed as hard as I could
to get away, and...

00:14.189 --> 00:15.655
That's when Lieutenant
Torres went down?

00:15.657 --> 00:16.806
I know what I saw!

00:16.808 --> 00:19.025
Post-traumatic stress
is a complicated disorder.

00:19.027 --> 00:21.077
WESTCOTT: <i>Something happened to me</i>
<i>that night, Agent Gibbs.</i>

00:21.079 --> 00:22.378
Torres was never dragged away,

00:22.380 --> 00:24.481
<i>it was one of my men</i>
<i>in the ambush.</i>

00:24.483 --> 00:26.249
I was back in Arghanda
all over again.

00:26.251 --> 00:29.002
And I was convinced that
that guy on the tape was there.

00:29.004 --> 00:31.421
McGEE: I.J.I.
It means something to Captain Westcott.

00:31.423 --> 00:32.539
Find out why.

00:32.540 --> 00:34.758
After-Action Report
of the Arghanda ambush

00:34.760 --> 00:37.710
ID'd the group responsible,
the Ijil Rebels.

00:37.712 --> 00:38.678
Randall Kersey really was

00:38.680 --> 00:40.013
<i>fighting with the enemy.</i>

00:40.015 --> 00:41.881
ZIVA: What is that?
A building blueprint.

00:41.883 --> 00:44.134
TONY: Looks like our John Walker Lindh
was planning something.

00:44.136 --> 00:45.852
Not was. Is.

00:45.854 --> 00:48.004
Find him.

00:49.306 --> 00:51.508
(helicopter blades whirring)

01:01.702 --> 01:03.653
Oh, no!

01:03.655 --> 01:05.120
See that, McCartney?

01:05.123 --> 01:07.040
Aw, you losing to
yourself again?

01:07.042 --> 01:08.374
No, man.

01:08.376 --> 01:09.909
She's looking at me.

01:09.911 --> 01:11.461
Yeah.
With her sexy little robe,

01:11.463 --> 01:12.745
and her big ol' bedroom eyes.

01:12.747 --> 01:15.415
Oh, yeah.
This girl wants me bad.

01:18.335 --> 01:21.337
Are we going on patrol tonight,
Captain Westcott?

01:21.339 --> 01:24.007
Well, if Hall can tear himself
away from his new girlfriend.

01:24.009 --> 01:25.175
(automatic gunfire)

01:25.177 --> 01:27.393
Sir, she's got nothing
on my Sara.

01:27.395 --> 01:29.813
Before I left, her
belly was out to here,

01:29.815 --> 01:30.980
but my Sara was still...

01:30.982 --> 01:33.233
ALL: The prettiest girl
in the Sunshine State.

01:33.235 --> 01:34.601
(laughing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:34.603 --> 01:36.803
(gunfire, Hall grunts)

01:37.655 --> 01:39.489
My baby girl wants
to be a ballerina?

01:39.491 --> 01:40.990
Daddy's gonna buy
her a tutu.

01:40.992 --> 01:42.492
She wants to play football?

01:42.494 --> 01:44.227
Daddy's gonna teach her
how to throw a spiral.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.412
Move! Move! Move! Move!

01:46.414 --> 01:50.233
(gunfire)

01:50.235 --> 01:51.668
Captain!

01:51.670 --> 01:54.771
"Daddy."

01:54.773 --> 01:56.506
Looks good on me, huh, Captain?

01:56.508 --> 01:58.007
Captain!

01:59.059 --> 02:01.161
Captain!

02:02.096 --> 02:04.180
GIBBS:
Captain Westcott?

02:04.182 --> 02:08.017
(knocking on door)

02:09.252 --> 02:12.188
(knocking continues)

02:17.061 --> 02:18.611
Sir?

02:18.613 --> 02:22.198
You were right about Kersey
being in Arghanda.

02:25.202 --> 02:27.270
With the enemy?

02:29.039 --> 02:30.907
Yeah, he's planning
something here.

02:30.909 --> 02:32.775
Gone off-grid.

02:32.777 --> 02:36.329
We need your help
to go find him.

WESTCOTT: Sorry, Agent Gibbs,
but I don't think I have

03:12.767 --> 03:14.217
anything else for you.

03:14.219 --> 03:18.187
You had contact with Kersey
here and in Afghanistan.

03:18.289 --> 03:21.574
Any detail could
give us something.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.865
He talk to anyone at
the convenience store?

03:29.867 --> 03:32.051
No.

03:32.053 --> 03:36.038
But it didn't seem like he was
there for a pack of gum, either.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.725
I tried to track
everything he was doing, but...

03:39.727 --> 03:41.377
it was too much.

03:41.379 --> 03:44.814
The After-Action Report
says that you and Torres

03:44.816 --> 03:48.901
were inside enemy headquarters
during the ambush.

03:48.903 --> 03:50.987
Honestly, sir, I only
put that in there

03:50.989 --> 03:53.022
because Torres said
we were inside.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.607
I don't...

03:54.609 --> 03:57.393
I only remember
the ambush in pieces,

03:57.395 --> 03:59.529
and that's not one of them.

03:59.531 --> 04:02.331
Anyone else
file a report?

04:02.333 --> 04:04.667
No, I was the C.O.

04:04.669 --> 04:07.420
Far as Kersey, uh...

04:07.422 --> 04:10.506
I clocked him
deep into the ambush.

04:10.508 --> 04:13.376
He was attempting
to capture PFC Hall.

04:15.212 --> 04:17.079
But I didn't see anything else.

04:17.081 --> 04:19.748
Any of your other men see him?

04:19.750 --> 04:24.053
There was only one other man
in the area: McCartney.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.438
Uh, I'm sorry.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.690
His-his real name
is Paul Patterson.

04:27.692 --> 04:29.925
Moved back home
after he got out.

04:29.927 --> 04:32.111
Virginia, I think.

04:32.113 --> 04:34.780
This kid, superhuman.

04:34.782 --> 04:37.066
Okay, Captain, you up for
taking a little trip tomorrow?

04:37.068 --> 04:39.435
Maybe the two of you can
put your heads together.

04:40.737 --> 04:43.906
He'll do whatever you
need, Agent Gibbs.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.375
No doubt, sir.

04:46.377 --> 04:49.462
Look, I know
you need to get well.

04:49.464 --> 04:52.415
And I won't keep you
any longer than I have to.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.617
It is a little
cramped in here.

04:54.619 --> 04:57.503
Be glad to get you guys
another room if it'll help.

04:57.505 --> 05:00.789
You feel like you
need watching, son?

05:02.175 --> 05:04.227
No, sir.

05:04.229 --> 05:06.312
But if you want to stay...

05:06.314 --> 05:07.613
Oh, no.

05:07.615 --> 05:09.232
I need to get back to Ohio.

05:09.234 --> 05:11.133
Come on, a few more days
won't hurt.

05:11.135 --> 05:13.236
GEORGE:
What?

05:13.238 --> 05:15.488
You heard what he said;
he said he's okay.

05:15.490 --> 05:17.740
Got it.

05:17.742 --> 05:20.159
No, I need to get
back to work.

05:20.161 --> 05:22.811
This time of year is brutal.

05:24.481 --> 05:26.499
I'd like someone here.

05:26.501 --> 05:28.751
(door closes)

05:28.753 --> 05:31.654
I'll stay.

05:36.376 --> 05:40.263
What do you mean it's sold out?

05:40.265 --> 05:41.664
No, no.

05:41.666 --> 05:43.499
It has to be Saturday night.

05:43.501 --> 05:46.769
Yes, it has to be the opera.

05:46.771 --> 05:48.671
Okay, do not tell me
that I'm out of luck,

05:48.673 --> 05:49.855
because I think it's...

05:49.857 --> 05:51.724
Fine.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.142
(grunts)

05:53.144 --> 05:54.560
(speaks Hebrew)

05:54.562 --> 05:56.345
Big three of romantic dates:

05:56.347 --> 05:58.364
beach picnic, impromptu dancing
in the rain and the opera.

05:58.366 --> 05:59.348
So who is he?

05:59.350 --> 06:01.517
He is no one.

06:01.519 --> 06:03.869
You're serious
about this guy?

06:03.871 --> 06:05.788
I'm serious about my
guy. Where's Kersey?

06:05.790 --> 06:08.857
Uh, current location
still unknown.

06:08.859 --> 06:10.960
BOLO went out wide.

06:10.962 --> 06:12.695
Neighbors last saw him
driving a blue sedan.

06:12.697 --> 06:14.697
Still looking for the plate
numbers, but there's nothing

06:14.699 --> 06:16.365
with wheels
registered to his name.

06:16.367 --> 06:17.717
Background?

06:17.719 --> 06:18.801
Randall J. Kersey.
25 years old.

06:18.803 --> 06:20.703
Born in the
City of Angels.

06:20.705 --> 06:22.305
ZIVA: He started a
degree in Philosophy

06:22.307 --> 06:23.756
at the University
of Maine,

06:23.758 --> 06:26.475
but a semester abroad in India
sent him in another direction.

06:26.477 --> 06:28.427
Yeah, the terrorist direction.
Hooked up with

06:28.429 --> 06:30.396
the Ijil Rebels
somewhere along the border,

06:30.398 --> 06:32.148
then he followed the pied piper

06:32.150 --> 06:34.400
across Pakistan,
into Afghanistan.

06:34.402 --> 06:36.319
ZIVA: CIA only knew him
by his Muslim name:

06:36.321 --> 06:38.237
Sulayman al-Janfi.

06:38.239 --> 06:39.655
They did not connect
that name to Kersey.

06:39.657 --> 06:40.690
Contacts?

06:40.692 --> 06:41.657
No living relatives,

06:41.659 --> 06:43.743
but he does list a girlfriend

06:43.745 --> 06:46.095
by the name of Brooke Fenten
as an emergency contact.

06:46.097 --> 06:47.780
McGEE:
You were right, boss.

06:47.782 --> 06:51.033
Abby confirmed that the paper
found in Kersey's basement

06:51.035 --> 06:52.585
was part of a
building blueprint.

06:52.587 --> 06:53.753
Does she know
which building?

06:53.755 --> 06:54.754
Not yet.

06:54.756 --> 06:56.572
But she did say the
explosive remnants

06:56.574 --> 06:59.175
suggest that Kersey
likely has two IEDs.

06:59.177 --> 07:02.178
Probably small in size, but
they'll pack a big punch.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.463
Must be quite the building
he's got his heart set on.

07:04.465 --> 07:05.965
Talk to the girlfriend.

07:05.967 --> 07:09.218
Girlfriend experience
coming up.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.441
More than happy
to wait here, sir.

07:15.443 --> 07:17.760
So, where'd the
nickname come from?

07:17.762 --> 07:18.894
McCartney?

07:18.896 --> 07:20.613
As in Paul.

07:20.615 --> 07:21.814
He had this old guitar.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.266
There was always music
coming out of this kid.

07:24.268 --> 07:26.986
Crazy what that kind of thing
means over there.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.337
Good guy to
have around.

07:28.339 --> 07:29.705
He was the one.

07:29.707 --> 07:32.941
Thanks to McCartney, Hall died
looking at us instead of them.

07:38.615 --> 07:40.449
Patterson.

07:40.451 --> 07:41.467
You okay?

07:41.469 --> 07:42.585
What are you doing here?

07:42.587 --> 07:45.388
This is Agent Gibbs from NCIS.

07:45.390 --> 07:48.557
Yeah, look, I heard about
what happened to Torres,

07:48.559 --> 07:49.809
and that's really sad,

07:49.811 --> 07:52.895
but I hardly needed
in-person notification, okay?

07:52.897 --> 07:54.630
Look, McCartney,
can we just come in...

07:54.632 --> 07:55.648
It's Patterson.

07:55.650 --> 07:57.349
What do you want?

07:58.635 --> 08:01.153
You recognize him?

08:01.155 --> 08:03.823
This guy was
in Arghanda.

08:03.825 --> 08:06.108
He was there that night firing
on us. Do you remember him?

08:06.110 --> 08:07.109
No.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.027
He grabbed Hall.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.328
He was one of the ones
that you...

08:09.330 --> 08:10.279
I said no!

08:10.281 --> 08:11.781
You know, I
was actually

08:11.783 --> 08:13.449
having a pretty
good day today.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.669
Like, what the hell
are you doing here?

08:16.671 --> 08:18.204
Huh?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.289
Where were you before?

08:21.508 --> 08:24.343
I needed you before.

08:24.345 --> 08:26.829
This... this I don't need.

08:30.851 --> 08:32.802
Hey.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.470
Bringing you here,
that was my idea.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.804
It's, uh...

08:35.807 --> 08:37.188
it's on me.

08:37.191 --> 08:38.724
That's my bad.

08:43.947 --> 08:45.097
(gunfire, men shouting)

08:45.099 --> 08:46.332
HALL:
Captain!

08:46.334 --> 08:47.700
Captain!

08:56.860 --> 08:58.394
Captain,
this must be their base.

08:59.029 --> 09:00.846
(gunfire, men shouting)

09:02.365 --> 09:04.400
Captain!

09:06.736 --> 09:08.037
Captain!

09:08.872 --> 09:10.306
Come on, Hall.

09:12.242 --> 09:14.393
(gunfire, men shouting)

09:15.195 --> 09:16.846
Captain, stop!
Joe!

09:20.150 --> 09:21.400
Joe, it's me.

09:21.402 --> 09:23.269
I remember the headquarters!

09:23.271 --> 09:25.053
(panting)

09:25.055 --> 09:26.906
Why are you running?

09:37.086 --> 09:39.304
(elevator bell dings)

09:41.557 --> 09:42.591
Captain W.

09:42.593 --> 09:43.809
Abby Sciuto.

09:43.811 --> 09:45.177
I'm here to help.

09:45.179 --> 09:46.561
You must be Sergeant W.

09:46.563 --> 09:47.629
Yeah.

09:47.631 --> 09:49.598
I love brothers.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.401
I just found my second one
at this animal rescue...

09:52.403 --> 09:54.569
Abbs.
Okay.

09:54.571 --> 09:57.939
Based on your After-Action
Report, I was able to whip up

09:57.941 --> 10:00.942
our very own version of
the Arghanda ambush using--

10:00.944 --> 10:04.613
ta-da!-- virtual reality.

10:04.615 --> 10:06.415
I'm more of a Super
Mario guy myself.

10:06.417 --> 10:09.484
Well, since VR
is being used to treat

10:09.486 --> 10:13.839
soldiers with PTS, I think this
will be better for your memory.

10:14.657 --> 10:17.843
And it could help
us find Kersey.

10:17.845 --> 10:19.461
This, uh, Kersey's blueprint?

10:19.463 --> 10:21.663
Uh, yeah, well,
the watermark led me

10:21.665 --> 10:23.164
directly to the U.S. Register
of Historic Buildings.

10:23.166 --> 10:27.636
So I'm comparing your piece to
all the registered blueprints.

10:27.638 --> 10:29.554
But I haven't had
a happy little ding yet.

10:29.556 --> 10:31.056
Speaking of happy little dings,

10:31.058 --> 10:33.108
what's your oven situation
for Thanksgiving?

10:33.110 --> 10:35.310
'Cause I need,
like, 40 minutes

10:35.312 --> 10:38.447
for my Aunt Gertie's caffeinated
green bean casserole.

10:38.449 --> 10:39.564
But I'm really
excited that you're

10:39.566 --> 10:40.732
letting us just invite
ourselves over...

10:40.734 --> 10:43.017
Abbs.
Uh, Lady Lab Coat,

10:43.019 --> 10:45.036
my brother just
turned this thing on.

10:45.855 --> 10:47.038
It was him, he did it.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.356
No, you did it.

10:48.358 --> 10:49.908
Excuse me.

10:53.036 --> 10:54.036
Here we go.

10:54.038 --> 10:56.422
Wow.

10:56.424 --> 10:59.291
Okay, this is Lady Lab Coat,

10:59.293 --> 11:02.127
and I'm just gonna walk
you through what we have.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.113
You and your men
are on foot patrol,

11:04.115 --> 11:08.166
and you see some gear
inside an abandoned building.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.570
You and Lieutenant Torres
move inside.

11:11.572 --> 11:13.555
This is crazy.

11:13.557 --> 11:14.857
That's the headquarters?

11:14.859 --> 11:17.009
Yeah, and your brother's
gonna help me fill it in.

11:17.011 --> 11:20.646
(typing, computer bleeping)

11:24.284 --> 11:26.068
I saw a table...

11:26.070 --> 11:28.287
with a computer.

11:28.289 --> 11:30.572
Uh, some kind
of satellite modem.

11:32.909 --> 11:35.210
And the wall was covered...

11:37.330 --> 11:38.363
...with documents,

11:38.365 --> 11:40.032
pictures, maps.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.225
That's when I saw "Ijil."

11:52.312 --> 11:54.379
I saw a picture of Kersey.

11:57.484 --> 12:00.653
Clean-cut,
like on his driver's license.

12:00.655 --> 12:02.905
Plans for his mission here?

12:06.242 --> 12:08.577
Could be, that's...

12:08.579 --> 12:09.578
that's all I got.

12:09.580 --> 12:11.580
ABBY:
Okay, well,

12:11.582 --> 12:12.865
let's, uh, move on then,

12:12.867 --> 12:14.416
to the ambush.

12:14.418 --> 12:16.568
(automatic gunfire,
men shouting)

12:18.672 --> 12:19.972
Move, move!

12:25.478 --> 12:28.080
(panting)

12:29.849 --> 12:31.517
(sighs)

12:34.187 --> 12:36.855
It might be worth
getting to the end.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.440
No, I know how it ends.

12:38.442 --> 12:40.309
Maybe we can take a walk and try...
Damn it, Evan.

12:40.311 --> 12:41.694
Damn it.

12:41.696 --> 12:43.095
Look, Agent Gibbs, that's...

12:43.097 --> 12:44.563
I-I gave you all I got.

12:44.565 --> 12:45.597
I'm done.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.783
I'm sorry, good luck.

12:54.824 --> 12:57.976
(elevator bell dings,
doors slide open)

12:57.978 --> 12:59.411
(sighs)

12:59.413 --> 13:02.247
You're right--
straight to voice mail.

13:02.249 --> 13:05.501
Yeah, so, when was
the last time you saw him?

13:05.503 --> 13:07.419
Ms. Fenten,

13:07.421 --> 13:10.005
when was the last time
you saw Mr. Kersey?

13:10.007 --> 13:11.340
He's not on chat, either.

13:11.342 --> 13:13.959
I mean, he's
always on chat.

13:13.961 --> 13:17.679
Even when he's at my place,
he's on my laptop on chat.

13:17.681 --> 13:20.182
Okay.

13:20.184 --> 13:21.633
So, who's he chatting with?

13:21.635 --> 13:24.269
Um, phone people--
he works at Bilson.

13:24.271 --> 13:27.990
They're always helping each
other with tech questions.

13:27.992 --> 13:29.775
I can't believe
he's not on chat.

13:29.777 --> 13:31.643
Well, like I told you,
he's got a few things going on.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.913
So, when was the last time
you saw Mr. Kersey?

13:34.915 --> 13:37.750
Oh! Um, yeah, sorry.
It was this morning.

13:37.752 --> 13:40.252
He came over to
say good-bye.

13:40.254 --> 13:43.288
He said his business trip
got moved up to today.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.490
So, where was he going?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.325
He was flying to
Houston, but from there

13:47.327 --> 13:49.011
he was going all over.

13:49.013 --> 13:50.162
Maybe even India.

13:50.164 --> 13:53.331
They were rolling out
this new...

13:55.018 --> 13:57.002
He was lying?

13:57.004 --> 14:00.272
We've been together
eight months.

14:00.274 --> 14:03.942
I thought I knew him.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.178
We're gonna need your laptop,
check out his chats.

14:06.180 --> 14:08.564
Yeah, of course,
it's at my apartment.

14:08.566 --> 14:12.668
And, uh, do you know anything
about a blue sedan?

14:12.670 --> 14:15.237
Well, that sounds like his car.

14:15.239 --> 14:17.322
Fantastic, you got the plates?

14:17.324 --> 14:20.209
I think it ends with a nine...

14:20.211 --> 14:21.376
or a six.

14:21.378 --> 14:23.378
Um, sorry.

14:23.380 --> 14:26.215
Well, maybe you could find it
through his uncle's name.

14:26.217 --> 14:30.169
Randy's uncle left him that car
when he died last year.

14:30.171 --> 14:33.639
What's the uncle's name?

14:34.507 --> 14:35.808
Kersey's only uncle,

14:35.810 --> 14:38.477
Daniel Kersey,
died in 1989.

14:38.479 --> 14:40.813
So, Randy lied to his girlfriend
about where he got the car.

14:40.815 --> 14:43.182
McGEE: Got her permission to keep
an eye on her communications

14:43.184 --> 14:44.900
but it's doubtful
he'll contact her.

14:44.902 --> 14:46.718
BOLO?
ZIVA: No hits.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.553
Not surprising without
a license plate.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.406
We went back to the convenience
store like you suggested,

14:51.408 --> 14:53.575
and the manager remembers
Kersey but nothing fishy.

14:53.577 --> 14:57.162
E-mail, cell phone,
credit cards-- all inactive.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.447
He knows we're on to him.

14:58.449 --> 14:59.581
Search area, McGee?

14:59.583 --> 15:02.251
Despite what Kersey
told his girlfriend,

15:02.253 --> 15:03.769
he did not fly out
this morning.

15:03.771 --> 15:05.420
All airports,
train stations

15:05.422 --> 15:08.406
and borders were secured and
monitored beginning last night.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.541
Well, if he's behind the wheel,

15:09.543 --> 15:10.909
making minimal stops,

15:10.911 --> 15:12.544
driving the speed limit
to avoid

15:12.546 --> 15:14.713
being pulled over,
could be anywhere

15:14.715 --> 15:16.548
inside that
400-mile radius.

15:16.550 --> 15:18.083
Lot of places
to hide.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.718
You know,
the girlfriend's computer

15:19.720 --> 15:21.270
might help narrow it down.

15:21.272 --> 15:24.606
She said Kersey used it
to chat up coworkers.

15:24.608 --> 15:26.808
As a field technician, he had
direct access to phone lines.

15:26.810 --> 15:27.976
Tim.

15:27.978 --> 15:29.194
On it, boss.

15:29.196 --> 15:30.646
ZIVA:
What about us?

15:30.648 --> 15:31.697
Figure out where
to look for a guy

15:31.699 --> 15:33.198
who knows we're
looking for him.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.734
Hmm.

15:35.736 --> 15:37.903
(elevator bell dings)

15:40.106 --> 15:41.106
Duck.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.658
Jethro.

15:42.660 --> 15:46.879
Ah, just in time for <i>The</i>
<i>Ballad of Randall J. Kersey.</i>

15:46.881 --> 15:49.081
It's a tragedy, I'm afraid.

15:49.083 --> 15:51.416
Yeah, always is.
Young Randall

15:51.418 --> 15:54.503
lost his parents
to a car accident

15:54.505 --> 15:56.388
when he was just five years old.

15:56.390 --> 15:59.007
Bounced from one
foster home to the next

15:59.009 --> 16:01.293
ran away from six
of the eight.

16:01.295 --> 16:03.312
He give a reason?
After each escape,

16:03.314 --> 16:06.398
he was recovered from the home
of one of his classmates,

16:06.400 --> 16:09.935
begging the parents
to let him stay.

16:09.937 --> 16:11.904
He wanted a permanent family.

16:11.906 --> 16:13.305
Yeah, well, like

16:13.307 --> 16:14.940
many terrorists organizations,

16:14.942 --> 16:18.577
the Ijil foster
unshakeable bonds.

16:18.579 --> 16:22.698
Now that Randall Kersey has
had a taste of such belonging,

16:22.700 --> 16:26.168
to return to a solitary life
would be a sacrilege.

16:26.170 --> 16:28.486
You think he's got help.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.988
Precisely.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.089
Where is he?

16:31.091 --> 16:32.708
We're trying to find
that out now, Duck.

16:32.710 --> 16:33.759
No, I meant

16:33.761 --> 16:35.260
where is Captain Westcott,

16:35.262 --> 16:37.996
other than at the forefront
of your mind?

16:37.998 --> 16:40.182
Uh, he's headed home.

16:40.184 --> 16:41.666
(sighs)

16:41.668 --> 16:46.054
Doc okayed me getting
into the ambush

16:46.056 --> 16:49.024
and then I pushed.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.227
Pushed too hard.

16:52.229 --> 16:55.530
Well, it's obvious that you feel
a grave responsibility

16:55.532 --> 16:57.032
towards this young man.

16:57.034 --> 16:59.534
Ducky, I sent home plenty
of marines like Westcott,

16:59.536 --> 17:03.021
and-and I knew their heads
weren't right.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.990
I hoped that there would be
someone

17:04.992 --> 17:07.291
on the other side to catch them.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.910
You had no choice.

17:08.912 --> 17:10.829
I mean, you had to stay behind.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.547
It was your duty.

17:12.549 --> 17:15.200
I'm on the other side now.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.386
I tried to catch Westcott.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.590
I didn't.

17:22.593 --> 17:23.892
He wouldn't let me.

17:23.894 --> 17:26.979
And when do you take "no"
for an answer?

17:26.981 --> 17:30.399
I'm angry, Ducky.

17:30.401 --> 17:33.986
You can't fix the world, Jethro.

17:33.988 --> 17:36.405
But you can call the boy.

17:42.278 --> 17:43.561
(phone line rings)

17:43.563 --> 17:44.830
WESTCOTT:
Hello?

17:44.832 --> 17:46.231
Hey, it's Gibbs.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.732
Hey, Agent Gibbs.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.334
Where are you?

17:49.336 --> 17:53.255
♪

17:53.257 --> 17:55.924
You knew that he was on meds
and you bring him here?

17:55.926 --> 17:57.592
Hey, hey, hey, don't worry about
it. What, let me guess,

17:57.594 --> 17:59.928
you're a scotch man-- can you
get him a scotch, neat, please?

17:59.930 --> 18:01.763
BARTENDER: You got it.
Come on, let's go, bud.

18:01.765 --> 18:03.548
Back off.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.267
You're not my father.

18:05.269 --> 18:07.419
He'd never come
and check in on me.

18:07.421 --> 18:09.087
He's always got better things
to do, right?

18:09.089 --> 18:11.023
Wait, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

18:11.025 --> 18:12.724
Sit down... the flight
doesn't leave till noon.

18:12.726 --> 18:14.526
Come on, man,
let's get out of here.

18:14.528 --> 18:15.944
You taking his side?

18:15.946 --> 18:17.279
There are no sides here.

18:17.281 --> 18:20.649
What are you doing taking
his side, you're my brother.

18:20.651 --> 18:22.317
Yeah, which is why I've
let you beat on me

18:22.319 --> 18:24.236
last three days
straight for no reason.

18:24.238 --> 18:26.204
Oh, no, I got a reason.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.106
Mm, good, let's talk
about it in the car, then.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.375
You don't get
what I've been through.

18:30.377 --> 18:33.111
So don't try to act like you do.
I just got back from over there.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.329
It's different.
I was in it out there,

18:34.331 --> 18:36.832
same as you, I saw guys die...
It's different!

18:36.834 --> 18:39.617
How is it different?!
It's the same damn thing!

18:40.636 --> 18:42.254
(both grunting)

18:43.089 --> 18:44.122
Hey!

18:44.124 --> 18:45.307
Come on, that's enough.

18:45.309 --> 18:47.426
Enough!

18:50.847 --> 18:54.632
Sit down.
(panting)

18:58.471 --> 19:01.740
It's different
because you're okay.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.995
Back up.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.482
Sorry.

19:19.622 --> 19:22.000
ZIVA:
McGee, you're here early.

19:22.001 --> 19:23.184
Been here all night.

19:23.186 --> 19:24.301
Combing through
Kersey's chats

19:24.303 --> 19:26.053
is a bigger job
than I thought.

19:26.055 --> 19:28.472
I swear, if I got
to read one more thing

19:28.474 --> 19:29.723
about a malfunctioning
VoIP system.

19:29.725 --> 19:30.941
Did you find anything?

19:30.943 --> 19:32.676
Chats are clean,
just looking for

19:32.678 --> 19:34.278
any files he might have saved.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.697
We're giving Kersey more
hiding places by the minute.

19:36.699 --> 19:37.848
Yup.

19:37.850 --> 19:38.866
Hey, speaking of places,

19:38.868 --> 19:40.034
I hear you're going
to the opera.

19:40.036 --> 19:43.404
No, I'm not going
to the opera,

19:43.406 --> 19:45.656
and that was
the worst segue ever.

19:45.658 --> 19:47.024
I know, it was forced.

19:47.026 --> 19:48.909
Tony made me promise
to ask you about it.

19:48.911 --> 19:51.862
It's unbelievable, why can't
he just leave it alone?

19:51.864 --> 19:54.498
Well, I think he thinks you're
pretty serious about this guy.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.717
I mean, the opera
is one of the big three.

19:56.719 --> 19:58.669
Why can't you just
leave it alone?

19:58.671 --> 20:00.504
Leave what alone?

20:00.506 --> 20:02.223
What did I miss?
(whispers): Did you ask her?

20:02.225 --> 20:03.841
Tony?
Did you tell him?

20:03.843 --> 20:05.643
No.
Bingo.

20:05.645 --> 20:06.977
What?

20:07.729 --> 20:09.880
Wow.

20:09.882 --> 20:11.849
Bingo is right, McVoyeur.

20:11.851 --> 20:13.100
She's smoking
in those shorts.

20:13.102 --> 20:15.986
My Lord, there is something
about a good strong

20:15.988 --> 20:16.987
ponytail, isn't there?

20:16.989 --> 20:19.573
Tony, the car.

20:20.525 --> 20:23.727
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a plate.

20:23.729 --> 20:26.780
Stellar work, McGee, just, uh,
shoot it over to me and I'll

20:26.782 --> 20:28.749
add it to the BOLO. (whispers):
Did she say anything?

20:28.751 --> 20:30.201
Leave it alone, Tony.

20:34.706 --> 20:36.941
Agent Gibbs, I signed off
on you exploring

20:36.943 --> 20:38.642
the ambush for good reason.

20:38.644 --> 20:41.295
The only way
to stop a traumatic event

20:41.297 --> 20:43.430
from taking over your life
is to face it.

20:43.432 --> 20:46.183
Doc, the kid is trying.

20:46.185 --> 20:48.719
And failing, I'm sure.

20:48.721 --> 20:50.454
Even with regular therapy
at home,

20:50.456 --> 20:53.691
the healing process
is going to be rocky.

20:53.693 --> 20:56.760
What about his recent
encounter with Mr. Kersey?

20:56.762 --> 21:00.364
Asked him, got flustered,
said there's too many details.

21:00.366 --> 21:03.400
Hypervigilance, re-experiencing,
they're both symptoms.

21:03.402 --> 21:05.703
He spots Kersey,
and he's overwhelmed.

21:05.705 --> 21:08.322
He sees everything
around him as a threat.

21:08.324 --> 21:10.774
Would it help to get him
back in the store?

21:10.776 --> 21:14.712
Retracing his steps could help
him isolate what's important.

21:14.714 --> 21:15.946
I'm not asking about the case.

21:15.948 --> 21:18.382
I'm asking about what
would help Westcott.

21:18.384 --> 21:21.719
I-I'm sorry,
is there a problem?

21:21.721 --> 21:23.621
Well, yeah, Doc,
there's a problem.

21:23.623 --> 21:24.922
You served, right?

21:24.924 --> 21:26.090
Iraq.

21:26.092 --> 21:27.841
Okay, then you know.

21:27.843 --> 21:29.126
Kids are going over

21:29.128 --> 21:31.095
and we're expecting them
to come back the same.

21:31.097 --> 21:32.513
The experience
changes everyone.

21:32.515 --> 21:33.731
What are we doing?

21:33.733 --> 21:35.599
Agent Gibbs...

21:35.601 --> 21:37.234
What are we doing?

21:37.236 --> 21:41.071
Agent Gibbs, I would raise
my hand all over again.

21:41.073 --> 21:43.274
Yeah, so would I,
so would Westcott.

21:43.276 --> 21:46.977
But he is blaming himself
for not doing more.

21:48.196 --> 21:50.781
How do I help him?

21:50.783 --> 21:53.867
Two objectives in the treatment
of PTS:

21:53.869 --> 21:59.323
rediscover sense of purpose,
rebuild trust.

22:00.759 --> 22:02.509
WESTCOTT:
<i>Look, I get it.</i>

22:02.511 --> 22:04.878
You show up here, you offer me

22:04.880 --> 22:06.930
some ice cream and a balloon
to stick around.

22:06.932 --> 22:08.465
But I'm sorry, sir.
I can't accept.

22:08.467 --> 22:11.185
Case isn't closed.
I still need your help.

22:12.270 --> 22:14.388
I'm not staying in this room
another day.

22:14.390 --> 22:16.506
Okay, then you can
bunk with me.

22:16.508 --> 22:18.609
Rocky Road's in the freezer.

22:18.611 --> 22:20.394
(scoffs)
You're hilarious.

22:20.396 --> 22:23.013
Yeah, I know.
Get in the car.

22:25.867 --> 22:27.951
See you at home, kid.

22:29.354 --> 22:31.855
Tell your dad I'm sorry
about Thanksgiving.

22:31.857 --> 22:33.791
You know,
that was the first fight

22:33.793 --> 22:37.261
we've ever been in where
we weren't on the same side.

22:37.263 --> 22:40.064
Look, I don't know what I
was thinking letting him drink.

22:40.066 --> 22:43.717
You weren't thinking.
It happens.

22:43.719 --> 22:47.671
I knew it was wrong,
but for a minute, I...

22:47.673 --> 22:48.872
He was himself.

22:48.874 --> 22:50.974
You know,
I had my old brother back.

22:50.976 --> 22:55.012
Find a way to love the brother
you got.

22:55.814 --> 22:57.881
Try to get him to sleep,
will you?

22:58.767 --> 23:00.150
Yeah.

23:00.152 --> 23:01.852
You staying?

23:01.854 --> 23:03.487
Yeah, we'll go back together.

23:03.489 --> 23:05.189
Whenever he's ready.

23:06.074 --> 23:08.659
Okay.

23:12.530 --> 23:15.899
Can't believe the old bird just
let you shut the place down

23:15.901 --> 23:17.401
so I could concentrate.

23:17.403 --> 23:19.203
Amazing what happens

23:19.205 --> 23:21.238
when you don't give
the bird a choice.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.540
You are a badass, Agent Gibbs.

23:23.542 --> 23:26.593
Okay, Captain, you're on.

23:28.380 --> 23:30.013
Hey.

23:30.015 --> 23:33.583
No harm at all if we come
out of here with nothing.

23:33.585 --> 23:36.420
Right.

23:38.990 --> 23:41.191
All right, uh,

23:41.193 --> 23:43.927
I was right here,

23:43.929 --> 23:46.363
Lieutenant Torres
was to my left.

23:46.365 --> 23:48.282
And, uh...

23:50.151 --> 23:52.286
I, uh...

23:52.288 --> 23:55.038
I first spotted Kersey
at my one o'clock.

23:57.175 --> 24:00.160
He's shifty.
He picks up a can of soup,

24:00.162 --> 24:02.613
but he doesn't
look at it.

24:02.615 --> 24:03.964
It's just for show.

24:05.283 --> 24:06.800
(bell jingles)

24:06.802 --> 24:08.585
The bell rings.

24:08.587 --> 24:11.621
And it's a girl
with blue hair.

24:11.623 --> 24:13.490
(bell jingling)

24:13.492 --> 24:16.143
Torres is telling me
that we gotta go.

24:16.145 --> 24:18.262
Come on, man. Let's get out of here.
He's the wrong guy.

24:18.264 --> 24:21.231
Hey, stay with Kersey.

24:25.437 --> 24:26.770
He's on the move.

24:28.490 --> 24:31.308
(bell jingles)

24:37.248 --> 24:38.832
You got a problem,
old man?

24:38.834 --> 24:40.000
What are you looking at?

24:42.253 --> 24:45.489
Come on, Joe, let's
go, man! Let's go!

24:47.825 --> 24:51.345
Let the rest go.

24:51.347 --> 24:52.930
Just Kersey.

25:10.482 --> 25:12.015
It was a handoff.

25:12.901 --> 25:15.452
That's good work.

25:15.454 --> 25:18.188
You badass.

25:18.190 --> 25:21.208
(laughs softly)

25:21.210 --> 25:24.495
Hey, boss, sketch artist said
Westcott gave her

25:24.497 --> 25:26.046
a good amount of detail.

25:26.048 --> 25:30.200
McGEE: That's some hairdo.
She shouldn't be hard to spot.

25:30.202 --> 25:34.054
So we're thinking straight line
from the Blue Bonnet to Kersey?

25:34.056 --> 25:35.889
She knows something.
Find out what.

25:35.891 --> 25:38.008
Now would be nice.

25:38.010 --> 25:39.009
Right. BOLO.

25:39.011 --> 25:40.377
DiNozzo!

25:40.379 --> 25:41.979
Yeah, boss?

25:42.730 --> 25:44.681
Ah. Taking it
to the streets.

25:44.683 --> 25:47.551
Thanks. Change of plans.
Kersey's car just got spotted

25:47.553 --> 25:49.236
by state police
on the G.W. Parkway.

25:49.238 --> 25:51.405
Tell the police no one goes in
till we get there.

25:53.591 --> 25:56.760
The whole grid,
he's still on the Parkway?

25:56.762 --> 26:00.564
GIBBS:
Randall Kersey! NCIS!

26:00.566 --> 26:02.232
Keep your hands
on the steering wheel!

26:03.284 --> 26:05.335
Hands, Kersey! Hands!

26:06.838 --> 26:08.505
Get out of the car.

26:08.507 --> 26:10.674
(sobbing)
Keep your hands up!

26:10.676 --> 26:12.209
(sobs):
Please don't shoot me!

26:12.211 --> 26:13.877
Where's Kersey?

26:13.879 --> 26:15.045
I don't know.

26:15.047 --> 26:16.413
Car's clear, boss.

26:16.415 --> 26:18.932
Superbad here is all alone.

26:18.934 --> 26:20.517
When did you last see
him? Where was he?

26:20.519 --> 26:23.136
Uh, uh, yesterday.
Rock Creek Park.

26:23.138 --> 26:26.106
Um, he said I should get
out of town right away,

26:26.108 --> 26:28.592
but I was so stoked
to have the car, that I...

26:28.594 --> 26:29.776
(sobbing)

26:29.778 --> 26:34.865
He paid me 200 bucks to take it
and keep driving.

26:34.867 --> 26:37.734
Please don't shoot me.

26:46.064 --> 26:47.041
Talk to me.

26:47.042 --> 26:48.708
Kersey's whereabouts
still unknown.

26:48.710 --> 26:50.677
Ziva's talking
to his hired driver.

26:50.679 --> 26:52.212
Since he ditched the car,

26:52.214 --> 26:54.064
we're probably looking for
something stolen.

26:54.066 --> 26:56.816
Kid puts him in Rock Creek Park
yesterday at 12:30 p.m.

26:56.818 --> 26:59.069
That would adjust
the radius to...

26:59.071 --> 27:01.387
No, that's where
he wants us to look.

27:01.389 --> 27:02.722
The bigger, the better.

27:02.724 --> 27:03.907
Boss?

27:03.909 --> 27:05.909
Shut it down.

27:06.911 --> 27:09.412
Kersey was working a
plan, he got spooked.

27:09.414 --> 27:11.114
A little visit to Interrogation
sent him running?

27:11.116 --> 27:14.400
No, he's not running.
Underground.

27:14.402 --> 27:17.621
He wanted us to follow the car
while he stuck to his plan.

27:17.623 --> 27:18.788
He's still in
the neighborhood.

27:18.790 --> 27:20.757
Kersey's driver does
not know anything.

27:20.759 --> 27:22.676
He's a runaway living
on the streets.

27:22.678 --> 27:24.427
Parents are addicts.

27:24.429 --> 27:27.080
I do not understand why
Kersey's using these children.

27:27.082 --> 27:28.715
It's better for him
if we pick up some kid

27:28.717 --> 27:29.916
who doesn't know anything.

27:29.918 --> 27:31.851
GIBBS: Kids who want to
belong, like he did.

27:31.853 --> 27:33.419
He knows how to
talk to them.

27:33.421 --> 27:36.223
DiNozzo. Blue hair?

27:36.225 --> 27:38.024
Canvass was a bust.

27:38.026 --> 27:39.092
Convenience store manager was

27:39.094 --> 27:40.644
a little more helpful.

27:40.646 --> 27:41.645
No name, but said

27:41.647 --> 27:43.613
that Marge Simpson is a regular.

27:43.615 --> 27:45.765
You two, go.

27:45.767 --> 27:47.234
Don't come back
without her.

27:49.487 --> 27:52.438
Hey, Gibbs, um, I heard McGee
say that he would

27:52.440 --> 27:54.607
like to spend more
quality time with Tony.

27:54.609 --> 27:58.712
So I thought, how about
a "boys only" stakeout?

27:58.714 --> 27:59.779
Ziver!

27:59.781 --> 28:02.332
I pointed to you and DiNozzo.

28:03.751 --> 28:08.638
Hey, cut the guy
some slack, will ya?

28:08.640 --> 28:10.223
It's the opera.

28:10.225 --> 28:11.975
One of the big three.

28:11.977 --> 28:13.843
TONY:
Let's go!

28:19.850 --> 28:21.735
Looked through
this a few times,

28:21.737 --> 28:23.486
but nothing
rings a bell.

28:24.438 --> 28:27.457
My couch is a good bed.

28:28.659 --> 28:30.026
Yeah, I can't sleep.

28:33.447 --> 28:36.816
I had a girl that smiled like
that when I stood next to her.

28:36.818 --> 28:41.988
She, uh, wrote me letters,
she kept me going.

28:41.990 --> 28:44.841
And when I got back, I...

28:44.843 --> 28:48.044
I cheated on her.

28:48.046 --> 28:51.497
I really loved
that girl.

28:51.499 --> 28:53.967
Truth is, he and I...

28:53.969 --> 28:57.387
we're no different.

28:57.389 --> 28:58.555
We run.

28:58.557 --> 29:01.558
And we take down everybody
else along the way.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.109
You're nothing like him.

29:03.111 --> 29:04.894
Torres was...

29:04.896 --> 29:06.179
Gone when he hit the pavement.

29:06.181 --> 29:07.513
There's nothing
you could've done.

29:07.515 --> 29:09.349
But Hall, Hall was different.

29:09.351 --> 29:12.485
He needed me,
and I just, I ran.

29:12.487 --> 29:15.422
Westcott... you're alive.

29:15.424 --> 29:16.856
You survived.

29:16.858 --> 29:20.744
For what? This?

29:20.746 --> 29:23.363
My dad won't
even look at me.

29:23.365 --> 29:25.498
I can't even look
at my brother.

29:25.500 --> 29:30.503
This thing is just, it's just...
it's eating me alive.

29:30.505 --> 29:32.889
Even Patterson.

29:32.891 --> 29:36.343
That kid was Superman,
and now he...

29:36.345 --> 29:39.729
The only way to beat this
is to keep on fighting.

29:39.731 --> 29:42.482
And it wouldn't hurt
to let the rest of us

29:42.484 --> 29:45.685
have a few whacks
from time to time.

29:50.891 --> 29:53.726
TONY: Yeah, well, I think the sun
is officially up,

29:53.728 --> 29:56.830
so let me be the first to
wish you a Happy Thanksgiving.

29:56.832 --> 29:59.949
Gobble, gobble.
(chuckles)

29:59.951 --> 30:02.752
How about the boss playing
the big host this year?

30:02.754 --> 30:04.204
Turkey legs by the fire.

30:04.206 --> 30:05.505
Shut up!

30:05.507 --> 30:08.792
I'm sick of you sitting in
this car being nice to me.

30:08.794 --> 30:10.043
My deepest apologies.

30:10.045 --> 30:11.711
You're only being nice
because you want me

30:11.713 --> 30:13.380
to tell you what you want
to know.

30:13.382 --> 30:15.048
Then tell me and
I'll stop being nice.

30:15.050 --> 30:16.549
There's nothing to tell.

30:16.551 --> 30:19.719
(sighs)
Fine. I'll make it up.

30:19.721 --> 30:21.438
He's a veterinarian!

30:21.440 --> 30:22.588
Stop raising your voice.

30:22.590 --> 30:24.190
I can't be nice,
I might as well be loud.

30:24.192 --> 30:25.525
Does he make you laugh?

30:25.527 --> 30:27.143
(laughs)
You're such a child.

30:27.145 --> 30:29.562
And then you wonder why
I cannot talk to you.

30:29.564 --> 30:31.064
So, he's a hilarious
veterinarian

30:31.066 --> 30:32.432
who likes the opera.

30:32.434 --> 30:34.901
Why do you care?
I thought we were past caring

30:34.903 --> 30:36.286
about these things!
Past them?

30:36.288 --> 30:38.271
Look, I don't care
who this guy is.

30:38.273 --> 30:41.624
I just thought we
were, you know,

30:41.626 --> 30:44.043
telling each other
things about things.

30:44.045 --> 30:47.613
The things that...

30:47.615 --> 30:49.449
you know, matter.

30:49.451 --> 30:53.253
Tony, there is no
funny veterinarian.

30:53.255 --> 30:57.173
There is no one, actually.

30:57.175 --> 31:00.677
Only Tali.

31:00.679 --> 31:02.345
Your sister?

31:02.347 --> 31:05.465
Mm-hmm. I think about her
every day,

31:05.467 --> 31:06.850
but this week is...

31:06.852 --> 31:10.353
this week is the most difficult.

31:10.355 --> 31:13.523
It's when you lost her?

31:13.525 --> 31:14.941
It's a birthday.

31:14.943 --> 31:17.193
Tomorrow, actually.

31:17.195 --> 31:19.362
Tali used to sing Puccini,

31:19.364 --> 31:23.249
and even my father's eyes would
get filled with tears.

31:23.251 --> 31:27.337
You know,
her dream was to be on stage.

31:27.339 --> 31:30.123
So every year on her birthday,
I go to the opera

31:30.125 --> 31:31.541
in honor of her.

31:31.543 --> 31:34.344
But this year,
this year was...

31:34.346 --> 31:36.713
It's sold out.
Yes.

31:36.715 --> 31:38.498
And I know
it sounds really...

31:38.500 --> 31:42.469
silly, but I feel like I'm...

31:42.471 --> 31:46.723
like I'm letting her down,
and...

31:46.725 --> 31:50.393
the love of a sibling is...

31:51.946 --> 31:56.149
Well, I'm lucky,
lucky to have known it.

32:05.543 --> 32:07.577
Got her.

32:10.697 --> 32:12.232
What do you want?

32:13.167 --> 32:14.751
NCIS. We need to talk.

32:14.753 --> 32:16.436
Look, I didn't do nothing.

32:16.438 --> 32:18.671
Lay off the double-negatives.
They confuse her.

32:20.758 --> 32:22.342
Randall Kersey.
Where is he?

32:22.344 --> 32:25.261
What are you asking
about him for?

32:25.263 --> 32:26.763
Why don't you tell us?

32:26.765 --> 32:28.431
It's just some guy.

32:28.433 --> 32:30.049
Come and bring us food
sometimes.

32:30.051 --> 32:31.734
You know,
odd jobs to make money.

32:31.736 --> 32:33.152
He was nice.

32:33.154 --> 32:35.855
He handed you something inside
this store last Saturday night.

32:35.857 --> 32:37.657
A piece of paper.
What was it?

32:38.492 --> 32:39.659
Instructions.

32:39.661 --> 32:41.578
He didn't talk details
in person.

32:41.580 --> 32:43.896
But, look, the jobs
were never anything bad.

32:43.898 --> 32:46.065
You know what we're gonna
ask you next.

32:46.067 --> 32:49.419
We met at this
coffee shop sometimes.

32:49.421 --> 32:51.921
That note said I should
be there today at 10:00.

32:51.923 --> 32:53.423
Why?

32:53.425 --> 32:56.175
He was gonna give me some box
to drop off at Union Station.

32:56.177 --> 32:57.710
It was nothing bad.

33:05.803 --> 33:09.255
(door opens, bell jingles)

33:15.446 --> 33:17.263
(bell jingles)

33:19.950 --> 33:22.802
That's my girl.

33:22.804 --> 33:25.989
On time as always.

33:27.658 --> 33:31.578
Now, you know where
this is going...

33:33.380 --> 33:36.132
...but I'd like to know
when it's done.

33:36.134 --> 33:40.003
I think we're pretty much
done right now.

33:45.509 --> 33:48.845
GIBBS: I'm sorry to cut your
holiday plans short, Mr. Kersey.

33:48.847 --> 33:51.598
Where's the other one?

33:53.434 --> 33:57.153
We know there's two.

33:57.155 --> 33:59.405
There's nothing
at the train station.

34:01.191 --> 34:03.409
So where did
you send it?

34:06.146 --> 34:09.982
Who are you working with?

34:09.984 --> 34:13.703
Some other kid you bought?

34:15.822 --> 34:17.005
(door opens)

34:17.007 --> 34:18.174
What...

34:18.176 --> 34:19.342
(door closes)

34:19.344 --> 34:20.493
What, that's it?

34:20.495 --> 34:21.994
Where's he going?!

34:21.996 --> 34:25.214
Guy actually has a conscience.

34:25.216 --> 34:27.467
Gibbs is gonna take
a hammer to it.

34:29.268 --> 34:30.687
You know,

34:30.688 --> 34:35.274
boss doesn't let too
many people back here.

34:35.275 --> 34:37.476
He asked, and I said yes.

34:37.478 --> 34:38.895
(door opens)

34:38.897 --> 34:41.347
It's closure.

34:41.349 --> 34:43.315
(door closes)

34:48.288 --> 34:50.706
Private Christopher Gomez.

34:52.693 --> 34:54.210
Nineteen.

34:54.212 --> 34:57.747
Left behind two little brothers
and a mother.

34:59.366 --> 35:01.834
The mom says that he
took care of everyone.

35:01.836 --> 35:02.885
Killed in action

35:02.887 --> 35:06.305
by the Ijil Rebels.

35:08.726 --> 35:12.061
You're not just killing
blank faces, Randall.

35:12.063 --> 35:14.514
Where's the bomb?

35:17.184 --> 35:20.553
Corporal Troy Baroni.

35:20.555 --> 35:23.322
22 years old.

35:23.324 --> 35:24.657
Gibbs has him.

35:24.659 --> 35:27.744
Those are my men.

35:27.746 --> 35:29.946
You okay?

35:29.948 --> 35:32.498
Coward won't even look at them.

35:32.500 --> 35:34.033
Look at them!

35:34.035 --> 35:37.086
Look at him.

35:37.088 --> 35:38.788
Private First Class

35:38.790 --> 35:39.956
James Hall.

35:39.958 --> 35:41.407
Wife waiting at home,

35:41.409 --> 35:43.242
pregnant with a baby girl.

35:43.244 --> 35:45.795
You remember him?!

35:45.797 --> 35:48.431
No one else needs
to get hurt!

35:48.433 --> 35:50.133
Where is the
bomb, Kersey?!

35:50.135 --> 35:51.768
(panting)

35:53.587 --> 35:55.138
Where's the bomb?!

35:55.140 --> 35:57.106
(panting)

35:57.108 --> 35:59.776
My name...

35:59.778 --> 36:03.980
is Sulayman al-Janfi.

36:03.982 --> 36:08.117
The Ijil are my brothers.

36:08.119 --> 36:12.121
Today, I failed them.

36:12.123 --> 36:14.624
But that night,

36:14.626 --> 36:17.543
I got one more savage
than I thought.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.113
Hey!

36:22.833 --> 36:24.167
You son of a bitch!

36:24.169 --> 36:25.418
Say his name!

36:25.420 --> 36:27.253
Get off him!
You say his name! You say his name!

36:27.255 --> 36:29.505
Get off me!
Let him go! Get off him!

36:29.507 --> 36:31.390
Private First
Class James Hall!

36:31.392 --> 36:33.176
Private First Class James Hall!
Get him off me!

36:39.733 --> 36:42.602
She was in the headquarters
on the wall!

36:42.604 --> 36:44.320
She's part of it!
Who?

36:44.322 --> 36:45.655
His girlfriend!

36:56.263 --> 36:57.087
Westcott?

36:57.088 --> 36:58.921
Doing fine.
Dorneget dropped him off

36:58.923 --> 37:00.589
with his brother.
Let's go.

37:00.591 --> 37:02.641
ZIVA:
Brooke Fenten, age 29.

37:02.643 --> 37:04.560
Never been to Afghanistan.

37:04.562 --> 37:05.794
Ponytail played us.

37:05.796 --> 37:07.646
Said the car came
from the uncle.

37:07.648 --> 37:09.148
Told Kersey what was up,

37:09.150 --> 37:10.482
he hired a driver.

37:10.484 --> 37:11.800
She threw his chats
in my face.

37:11.802 --> 37:13.969
I hate her, no matter how good
she looks in those shorts.

37:13.971 --> 37:16.188
It is unclear how she is
linked to the Ijil, but...

37:16.190 --> 37:17.305
I don't care.
Skip it.

37:17.307 --> 37:18.657
Where is she now?

37:18.659 --> 37:19.992
Uh, well, didn't answer
her cell, nobody's home.

37:19.994 --> 37:21.160
McGee.

37:21.162 --> 37:22.611
Work schedule on her computer

37:22.613 --> 37:24.279
has her catering
a Thanksgiving event tonight.

37:24.281 --> 37:25.747
Where?

37:25.749 --> 37:27.499
Still working on it.
No address listed.

37:27.501 --> 37:28.667
Gibbs! Gibbs! Gibbs!

37:28.669 --> 37:30.152
Gibbs trifecta. Nice.

37:30.154 --> 37:31.920
I finally got a match
on the blueprint

37:31.922 --> 37:32.871
from Kersey's basement.

37:32.873 --> 37:34.256
It was on
the historic register.

37:34.258 --> 37:37.960
This home belongs to
Senator Geoffrey Roberts.

37:37.962 --> 37:40.045
Boss, Senator Roberts
is hosting the members

37:40.047 --> 37:41.163
of the Joint Economic Committee

37:41.165 --> 37:42.464
and their families
for Thanksgiving.

37:42.466 --> 37:43.715
It's all over the news.

37:43.717 --> 37:45.651
Take a big bite
out of Congress with one hit.

37:45.653 --> 37:46.768
Saddle up.

37:46.770 --> 37:48.270
Event security has to be
U.S. Capitol Police.

37:48.272 --> 37:49.354
Call on the way.

37:49.356 --> 37:51.356
Abbs, get me
the address.

37:53.042 --> 37:54.376
ABBY:
Okay, but...

37:54.378 --> 37:58.113
you'll be back
by turkey time, right?

38:08.858 --> 38:12.161
(horn honks, siren chirps)

38:12.163 --> 38:13.462
Device?

38:13.464 --> 38:14.663
In the kitchen--
it was found

38:14.665 --> 38:16.081
in one of the food
storage bins.

38:16.083 --> 38:18.500
Bomb squad already
has it disarmed, but...

38:18.502 --> 38:19.718
boss, they lost Fenten.

38:19.720 --> 38:21.053
Do we know
she was here?

38:21.055 --> 38:22.554
Multiple witnesses
saw her at the party.

38:22.556 --> 38:24.640
No sightings after
the police entered.

38:24.642 --> 38:25.841
Her staff doesn't
know anything.

38:25.843 --> 38:26.758
They all look clean.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.594
Roadblocks
are out.

38:29.479 --> 38:31.213
She's got to be on foot.

38:31.215 --> 38:32.181
Boss.

38:32.183 --> 38:35.400
I found this stuffed
in a closet.

38:35.402 --> 38:36.602
She could be hiding
inside the house.

38:36.604 --> 38:39.738
No, she always had a plan
to get out.

39:15.591 --> 39:17.759
I'm glad you came back.

39:18.628 --> 39:20.612
I, uh...

39:20.614 --> 39:22.981
saw what happened
through the window. Um...

39:22.983 --> 39:24.599
I wanted to come out, but...

39:24.601 --> 39:26.168
Oh, I don't
blame you. I'm...

39:26.170 --> 39:30.205
I must've looked like a deranged
Forrest Gump out here.

39:35.578 --> 39:36.995
(sighs)

39:36.997 --> 39:40.615
My head's messed up,
McCartney.

39:41.467 --> 39:44.786
It-it sucks saying that, but...

39:45.838 --> 39:48.624
Maybe you should think
about talking to someone, too.

39:48.626 --> 39:51.093
See about picking up
that guitar again.

39:51.095 --> 39:52.177
(scoffs)

39:52.179 --> 39:54.846
Yeah, I don't know
if I have it in me.

39:54.848 --> 39:57.516
You already ran head-on
at the enemy once.

39:58.301 --> 40:00.969
Yeah, you got
it in you.

40:00.971 --> 40:02.904
Hall.

40:02.906 --> 40:05.807
He means how you got Hall
and brought him back to us.

40:06.626 --> 40:08.277
What? N...

40:08.279 --> 40:10.746
That... that wasn't me, Captain.

40:12.315 --> 40:14.032
That was you.

40:17.854 --> 40:20.322
(gunfire, men shouting)

40:21.090 --> 40:22.791
HALL:
<i>Captain!</i>

40:22.793 --> 40:24.092
Captain!

40:26.495 --> 40:28.664
Captain!

40:28.666 --> 40:30.499
(panting)

40:30.501 --> 40:32.050
Okay, okay, I'm here.

40:33.169 --> 40:35.053
Come on, Hall.

40:35.055 --> 40:36.104
(gunfire)

40:36.106 --> 40:38.106
Come on.

40:43.012 --> 40:46.098
I didn't run away.

40:46.983 --> 40:49.151
You didn't run.

40:51.687 --> 40:54.206
Forgive yourself for the rest.

40:55.041 --> 40:58.327
I just wish
it would've mattered.

40:58.329 --> 41:02.414
The general never ran
from anything.

41:04.133 --> 41:06.001
It mattered.

41:06.003 --> 41:08.203
To us.

41:13.393 --> 41:15.560
(sighs)

41:22.218 --> 41:23.902
Hey.

41:24.771 --> 41:25.687
Oh, hey.

41:25.689 --> 41:27.389
Are you heading over?
Yeah.

41:27.391 --> 41:29.391
Abby was so
excited Gibbs moved

41:29.393 --> 41:30.609
Thanksgiving
to tonight.

41:30.611 --> 41:32.077
Listen, I told the boss
that, uh,

41:32.079 --> 41:33.228
you're gonna be a little late.

41:33.230 --> 41:35.397
Come on, Tony,
you've seen me drive.

41:35.399 --> 41:36.365
I'm never late.

41:36.367 --> 41:37.833
Did you know
that McGee installed

41:37.835 --> 41:39.584
a crazy surround sound system
in here?

41:39.586 --> 41:42.371
I came in one night,
and he was playing video games

41:42.373 --> 41:44.539
wearing a cape.

41:45.591 --> 41:48.877
(Puccini's "O mio babbino caro"
playing)

41:51.347 --> 41:53.799
I know it's not
the same, but...

41:53.801 --> 41:55.750
maybe if you closed your eyes,

41:55.752 --> 41:58.637
it'd be like you were
at the opera.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.607
And maybe even like...

42:02.609 --> 42:04.810
Tali's there with you.

42:10.066 --> 42:12.434
Thank you.
