Kate says it's all you're worth.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.440
Your boys spend half their time
in Darlo police station...

26:17.440 --> 26:19.200
That's bullshit.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.880
You pocketed the rest.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.791
...instead of looking out for her girls.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.200
That's what she said.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.880
Empty your pockets.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.360
Mate, I'm only the messenger.

26:29.360 --> 26:33.433
Empty your pockets
or I'll cut 'em open.

26:42.560 --> 26:45.000
Look, I'd love to stay
and chew the fat with you boys,

26:45.000 --> 26:46.840
but I've got an important meeting.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.718
Gotta meet me a ching chong Chinaman
down the docks about some snow.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.550
Kate Leigh trying to stiff us?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.560
She wouldn't dare, mate.

26:59.560 --> 27:02.233
Good. I'll have what's owing to me, then.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.159
Coppers.

27:23.760 --> 27:26.120
Six ain't your lucky number, dago.

27:26.120 --> 27:28.240
They're gonna love having you
back out in the Bay.

27:28.240 --> 27:31.520
Word on the street is you've been
providing muscle for Kate Leigh.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.476
Don't believe everything you hear, mate.

27:35.400 --> 27:38.120
You give us something solid
to hang on that drack bitch,

27:38.120 --> 27:39.880
you may just stay a free man.

27:39.880 --> 27:43.040
(SCOFFS) Gentleman's too stupid
to know what's good for him, Detective.

27:43.040 --> 27:46.396
Pity. Can't be a big shot
in a Long Bay jail cell.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.679
Get him outta here.
GUIDO: No, hang on!

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
JACQUI JAMES:
<i>The crook's classic dilemma</i> -

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
<i>do I sell my mates down the river</i>
<i>in ex change for a free walk.</i>

28:00.000 --> 28:03.959
<i>or do I cop it sweet and go back to jail?</i>

28:06.320 --> 28:09.198
No-one can know
that this came from me.

28:16.640 --> 28:19.680
Are you sure this is good?
Worth taking a punt.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.240
Calletti's trying to save his own skin.

28:21.240 --> 28:22.840
It's hardly worth betting the farm on it.

28:22.840 --> 28:26.116
If we can nab Kate with a shipment
of cocaine, we can send her away.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.000
Take Sergeant Armfield
and Constable McElroy with you

28:30.000 --> 28:32.120
in case you need to search any females.

28:32.120 --> 28:33.840
Good hunting, lads.

28:33.840 --> 28:37.549
Bloody women! Taking over!

28:42.960 --> 28:44.598
(PHONE RINGS)

28:46.120 --> 28:47.075
Coming!

28:52.560 --> 28:55.120
Constable McElroy,
this is Syd Thompson.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.200
You'll be under him.
G'day.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.080
Edie.
Welcome aboard.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.149
Thanks.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.354
If you ladies are done,
we've got some crooks to catch.

29:16.480 --> 29:19.313
You're making me nervous
with that thing, sunshine.

29:21.120 --> 29:23.240
I'm looking after your security, Kate.

29:23.240 --> 29:25.240
You've a valuable shipment due.

29:25.240 --> 29:28.000
If it bloody gets here.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.600
Herb'd be late for his own funeral.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.360
Maybe he got lost!

29:32.360 --> 29:34.840
Probably chased a cat up a tree.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.273
(DOOR CLOSES)

29:38.400 --> 29:40.280
About bloody time!

29:40.280 --> 29:42.635
It's not my fault. Those Chinese,
they all look the same!

29:46.040 --> 29:47.960
We followed Brown up from the docks.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.840
He went inside about 20 minutes ago
but no-one's come out since.

29:50.840 --> 29:53.880
I'll cover the back lane in case
they make a run for it that way.

29:53.880 --> 29:55.840
Yeah, good.

29:55.840 --> 29:58.880
Safe to assume on recent form
that the bitch is armed.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.240
So we go in with weapons drawn.

30:01.240 --> 30:03.720
Keep your wits about you
and stay with me.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.676
Let's get the evil cow!

30:10.440 --> 30:12.480
KATE: Alright, game's over.

30:12.480 --> 30:15.040
Oh, just my luck. I've got a good hand!

30:15.040 --> 30:16.960
Get this to the girls on Victoria Street.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.916
Police! Nobody move!

30:20.760 --> 30:22.600
Get out of my house, you bastards!
He said...

30:22.600 --> 30:24.636
...don't move.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.280
Nothing.
Where's the snow, arsehole?

30:28.280 --> 30:31.000
As for you... (SPITS)
Mount Kosciuszko?

30:31.000 --> 30:32.160
Hey!
Detective!

30:32.160 --> 30:33.640
Search the bitches!

30:33.640 --> 30:36.440
Get your hands off me!
You don't scare me, Kate. Take her.

30:36.440 --> 30:38.560
You bloody bull dykers!
EILEEN: Ma!

30:38.560 --> 30:41.233
Get your hands off me!
Shut up! Stand still.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.670
Grab it. Don't let it burn.

30:49.720 --> 30:51.640
Detective - cocaine twists.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.440
Tear the place apart!

30:53.440 --> 30:56.400
Kate Leigh, you're under arrest
for the possession of cocaine.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.480
You dirty stinking copper!

30:58.480 --> 31:01.400
(ALL CLAMOUR)

31:28.800 --> 31:31.280
Fred Devine,
you get back here right now!

31:31.280 --> 31:34.040
You do <i>not</i> talk to me like that,
young man, alright?

31:34.040 --> 31:35.800
What's going on?

31:35.800 --> 31:39.440
I buy him new clothes, I take him out of
this hideous slum, and what's he do?

31:39.440 --> 31:41.400
He runs back here first chance he gets.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.880
You're not my mother!

31:42.880 --> 31:45.760
And he keeps saying that even though
he knows full well I am!

31:45.760 --> 31:47.400
I hate you!

31:47.400 --> 31:49.240
Fred...

31:49.240 --> 31:51.000
He's only a child!

31:51.000 --> 31:53.878
Huh! About time he started
acting like a man.

31:55.360 --> 31:57.120
There's a letter come for you.

31:57.120 --> 31:59.000
Oh, good.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.920
It'll be from Jim.
It'll say when he's coming.

32:00.920 --> 32:04.629
I bought him a beautiful tie pin
from Harrod's. He's gonna love it.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.880
"Hello, darling. I hope this finds you well.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.680
Kind of woman you are.

33:53.680 --> 33:56.353
You know why I hate you?

33:57.720 --> 34:01.040
Because you pretend to be
a God-fearing pillar of the community

34:01.040 --> 34:02.996
but you are nothing but a leech.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.920

Well, the man is a shocking skite.

(LAUGHS) Yeah. Yeah.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.751
So it had nothing to do with you, then?

40:11.240 --> 40:13.310
(SIGHS) I'm allergic to coppers.

(SNIFFS)

40:18.920 --> 40:21.798
You smell distinctly canine to me.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.200
If you're calling me a dog,

40:26.200 --> 40:28.998
you better be able to prove it.

40:36.840 --> 40:39.120
You're sacked, by the way.

40:39.120 --> 40:40.720
Now, you get out of my car

40:40.720 --> 40:43.359
and you piss off back to that fruit barrow,
where you belong.

41:10.520 --> 41:15.280
(SIGHS) How does it feel to have
the sun shine on your face, eh?

41:15.280 --> 41:18.720
To Maroubra, thanks, duckie.

41:18.720 --> 41:21.473
Can't wait to feel my
big man's arms around me!

41:35.320 --> 41:36.840

41:38.760 --> 41:40.240
Jim?

41:40.240 --> 41:41.760
(BOTH MOAN)
Oh!

41:41.760 --> 41:45.280
Get off me, get off me,

41:52.400 --> 41:54.880
Fuck's sake.
G'day, love. What are you doing here?

41:54.880 --> 41:57.120
I live here. Who the fuck is this slut?

41:57.120 --> 41:58.280
Phyllis here just helps out...

41:58.280 --> 42:01.200
Get the fuck outta my house
before I cut your fucking tits off!

42:01.200 --> 42:04.040
She just helps out around the place!
Does a bit of cooking and cleaning.

42:04.040 --> 42:06.080
Oh, yeah! And polishing
your fucking knob!

42:06.080 --> 42:08.400
Talk to me like that! You wanna watch it!

42:08.400 --> 42:09.913
Ow!
Fucking shit!

42:13.440 --> 42:15.840
You piece of shit! I'll fucking kill you!

42:15.840 --> 42:17.480
Not if I kill you first!

42:17.480 --> 42:19.710
Oh, shit! Oh, fuck!

42:21.240 --> 42:23.760
The bastard's trying to
fucking murder me!

42:23.760 --> 42:25.113
