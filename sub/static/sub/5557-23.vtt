Amazing night last night,
monumental, "the voice" history

Seven out of the top ten songs,

05:30.502 --> 05:33.671

Adam as remained intact through

05:52.224 --> 05:55.659
Tell us what it is like off

05:55.794 --> 06:00.364
That friendship means to you.

06:00.499 --> 06:02.366
Much fun we have.
But we have something special in

06:02.501 --> 06:07.872
Common.
And that is -- we're just so

06:08.006 --> 06:11.408
Thankful to god above all else
that he put us here.

06:11.543 --> 06:14.712
And we know that no matter what
happens that he's got a plan and

06:14.846 --> 06:19.350
Purpose for all of our lives.
I think that makes us just

06:19.484 --> 06:23.587
Connect in a way that surpasses
all else.

06:23.722 --> 06:25.790

america?

06:41.506 --> 06:46.177

to the judges that i like to

06:46.311 --> 06:51.816
Have fun on stage and move
around and take my hips but

06:51.950 --> 06:56.320
There's more to that to me.
And i like to sing music.

06:56.454 --> 07:00.291
If i get to move on, to give a
solid vocal performance.

07:00.425 --> 07:02.293

Blake, you have a big
announcement of someone coming

09:36.047 --> 09:40.851
In next week for the semifinals.
Tell me about that.

09:40.986 --> 09:43.721
>> it's not often that i'm super
jealous of the contestants on

09:43.855 --> 09:47.091
The show.
But i'm super jealous next week

09:47.225 --> 09:53.130
But they will be mentored by a
young lady by the name of dolly

09:53.264 --> 09:57.835
Parton.
Dolly is going to mentor the

09:57.969 --> 09:59.670
Nine remaining contestants and
she's also going to perform on

09:59.804 --> 10:02.706
The show.
This is a big deal.

10:02.841 --> 10:05.609
It's a huge deal.
We get dolly here.

10:05.744 --> 10:08.545
I'm freaking out.
>> next week and you're freaking

10:08.680 --> 10:11.081
Out.
Do you know dolly well?

10:11.216 --> 10:13.851
>> no, nobody does.
>> is she real?

10:13.985 --> 10:16.553
>> she's really coming here.
>> we're going the find out next

10:16.688 --> 10:19.256
Week.
Pharrell, you are down to one

10:19.391 --> 10:20.991
Artist.
One artist is going home

10:21.126 --> 10:25.996
Tonight.
What is that pressure like for

10:26.131 --> 10:30.134
You to keep madi in the show?
>> i don't know if it's pressure

10:30.268 --> 10:36.740
So much as it is just really the
talent that the artist has has

10:36.875 --> 10:42.913
The rapport they have with the
american public and i'm super

10:43.048 --> 10:48.285
Confident in madi's talent --
her gift, rather and her rapport

10:48.420 --> 10:53.257
With the public.
>> gwen, you had three powerful

10:53.391 --> 10:57.561
Performances from your team last
night, what is the one thing you

10:57.695 --> 10:59.997
Try to instill in your team each
week?

11:00.131 --> 11:03.500
>> i feel like i just want them
to share their story of who they

11:03.635 --> 11:07.571
Are and get really personal and
get people to know them.

11:07.705 --> 11:11.241
Being unique is what is the most
important thing.

11:11.376 --> 11:12.242
I just try to share that with
them.

11:12.377 --> 11:16.080
Just be you.
>> carson: Adam, congratulations

11:16.214 --> 11:19.483
On jordan moving on.
You are a veteran coach.

11:19.617 --> 11:23.620
It's your ninth season.
What does it take for an artist

11:23.755 --> 11:28.425
To make it to the semifinals?
>> if i knew that answer it

11:28.560 --> 11:34.832
Would be easier to be a coach.
We have done a lot on this show

11:34.966 --> 11:38.202
Seasons.
It's a balance of learning from

11:38.336 --> 11:42.406
The nine seasons and pushing
yourself to be better.

11:42.540 --> 11:46.643
Like blake and i you have to do
things to keep it fresh for the

11:46.778 --> 11:50.514
People on your team but stay
inspired and keep your team

11:50.648 --> 11:54.084
Inspired and chemothem from
being nervous.

11:54.219 --> 11:57.187
There is about a million things.
But that is three of them.

11:57.322 --> 12:00.724
>> carson: Let's see if your
hard work paid off this week.

12:00.859 --> 12:15.305

artists as the live eliminations

12:15.440 --> 12:18.408
Continue here on "the voice."
welcome back, everybody.

12:18.543 --> 12:21.678
Quick question to madi.
We were talking to your coach

12:21.813 --> 12:23.680
Pharrell.
You are his last remaining

12:23.815 --> 12:28.485
Artist.
What is the one thing that he

12:28.620 --> 12:30.587
Has taught you that people at
home don't know about?

12:30.722 --> 12:37.227
>> something that pharrell has w
is just to be open in everything

12:37.362 --> 12:43.767
That you do and accept all kinds
of criticism and helpful words

12:43.902 --> 12:48.939
Because that's how you grow.
And i people that's why i've

12:49.073 --> 12:50.307
Grown so much on this show
because i've become more open

12:50.441 --> 12:53.510
And, yeah --
[ applause ]

12:53.645 --> 12:59.449
>> carson: Thank you, madi.
Very cool.

12:59.584 --> 13:02.753
Let's talk to barrett, we saw
last night how connected you are

13:02.887 --> 13:05.889
With your students.
What is the one lesson you

13:06.024 --> 13:10.127
Learned here that you want to
pass on to them?

13:10.261 --> 13:15.432
>> i think we as adult sometimes
fail our youth in that we make

13:15.567 --> 13:18.335
Them think they have to have a
distinct plan for their life.

13:18.469 --> 13:22.739
I learned in this process and i
hope they see too, that it's

13:22.874 --> 13:26.810
Okay to sometimes run into the
unknown and not be afraid of

13:26.945 --> 13:29.012
What that is especially if you
believe in yourself.

13:29.147 --> 13:33.517
That what's i'm doing here.
Sometimes the plan can be

13:33.651 --> 13:36.653
Renegotiated and it works out
well.

13:36.788 --> 13:39.356
>> carson: Well said, thank you,
barrett.

13:39.490 --> 13:42.459

Year ago, i would have told you
you were crazy.

16:59.490 --> 17:03.860
I thought it was a waste of gas
money to go to the auditions.

17:03.995 --> 17:07.297
The stuff i learned from gwen
i'm going to take with me the

17:07.432 --> 17:14.938
Rest of my life.
>> thank you, friend.

17:15.071 --> 17:18.474
>> quick question for shelby.
It was an emotional moment last

17:18.608 --> 17:23.512
Night.
You sang is a song in memory of

17:23.647 --> 17:26.715
Your late grandfather.
What did it mean that moment for

17:26.851 --> 17:30.053
You?
>> last night i had a moment

17:30.188 --> 17:33.723
Where on the show i haven't had
a moment to emotionally connect

17:33.858 --> 17:39.863
With a performance and a song.
And last night i was able to

17:39.997 --> 17:42.165
Open up and let my raw emotion
pour out.

17:42.300 --> 17:44.501
I didn't want everything to be
crazy.

17:44.635 --> 17:49.439
I wanted it to be about the
lyrics of the song and for it to

17:49.574 --> 17:52.008
Be just an emotional performance
and i feel i accomplished that.

17:52.143 --> 17:53.844
>> carson: You certainly did.
Thank you.

17:53.978 --> 17:55.779
It's time to announce two more
saved by america's votes.

17:55.913 --> 18:00.851
The remaining four will still be
at risk of elimination.

18:00.985 --> 18:11.294
Here with the names.
And here we go.

But before we go to break,
something big is happening on

Nbc.

20:19.490 --> 20:20.690
Four artists remain at risk of

Incredible voice.

Thunderstorm

I played alone ¶
¶ i'm playing on my own

Quick question, corinne, you
have been instantly saved by

24:49.693 --> 24:53.496
America two weeks in a row.
That has to be grueling for you.

24:53.631 --> 24:56.766
What have you learned about
yourself?

24:56.901 --> 25:01.137
>> i have learned a lot about
myself this entire competition

25:01.272 --> 25:05.341
But a lot that i have gained in
this competition is confidence.

25:05.476 --> 25:08.177
And being saved twice shows how
many people love and support me

25:08.312 --> 25:11.080
And see the message i want to
get out to the world.

25:11.215 --> 25:18.755
And the main thing i learned
about myself is i'm a lot m

25:18.889 --> 25:22.659
Fearless than i thought i was.
And there's a lot more fight in

25:22.793 --> 25:24.894
Me.
>> carson: Thank you, good luck

25:25.029 --> 25:30.099
Tonight.

You all right?
You all right?

30:23.994 --> 30:29.999
[ applause ]
well -- a little trouble with

30:30.133 --> 30:33.603
The lyrics but you had a minute
and a half to prove who you are

30:33.737 --> 30:35.504
As an artist.
Some people would have run off

30:35.639 --> 30:39.175
The stage.
What did you think, blake

30:39.309 --> 30:43.646
Shelton?
>> there is not -- of the four

30:43.780 --> 30:48.184
Of us sitting here, not one of
us had a -- that's happened to

30:48.318 --> 30:53.422
All of us, not one of us are
free of something like that

30:53.557 --> 30:56.826
Happening to us on stage.
And the pressure -- the pressure

30:56.960 --> 31:01.764
That you continue to feel week
after week, you know, it's -- i

31:01.898 --> 31:04.934
Hate that you're always in this
twitter save but the one thing

31:05.068 --> 31:08.237
You have proven up to this point
is you deserve to be in this

31:08.372 --> 31:14.143
Competition.
Are we going to have to forget

31:14.278 --> 31:17.146
The lyrics some times?
Absolutely, i will not be

31:17.281 --> 31:20.983
Surprised to see you saved once
again this week because of what

31:21.118 --> 31:25.888
You have already laid out there
and your ground work being in

31:26.023 --> 31:31.527
This competition so far.
>> c

31:31.662 --> 31:36.666
>> carson: Pharrell?
>> korin, i agree with something

31:36.800 --> 31:41.070
That blake and carson said, that
has totally happened to all of

31:41.204 --> 31:45.908
Us, number one, and number two,
this is the time for america to

31:46.043 --> 31:47.343
See who you are and you got
knocked down and you got right

31:47.477 --> 31:55.451
Back up.
So -- listen, you hold you head

31:55.585 --> 32:00.589
Up high because america, they
saw who you are, they see who

32:00.724 --> 32:02.958
You are and they're with you
rd.

32:03.093 --> 32:10.933
You got knocked down twice, by
the way, smile it off, sang it

32:11.068 --> 32:14.437
Off, got back in the ring and
fought.

32:14.571 --> 32:16.372
>> carson: There were two spots
where she had trouble with the

32:16.506 --> 32:19.542
Lyrics.
Even in the last three seconds

32:19.676 --> 32:23.813
Of the song, she still is
sitting out here trying to sell

32:23.947 --> 32:27.149
That voice to america who has an
opportunity to instantly save

32:27.284 --> 32:30.052
Her for a third time.
What did you see in that

32:30.187 --> 32:33.689
Performance?
>> this is the situation, that

32:33.824 --> 32:36.559
Girl right there is deep.
Okay, the reason she had that

32:36.693 --> 32:41.897
Moment right there is because
she feels and she's real.

32:42.032 --> 32:46.202
She's honest.
So if you're a human being, if

32:46.336 --> 32:49.338
You're a human being and that
deep and that tapped into

32:49.473 --> 32:51.140
Yourself, that's going to
happen.

32:51.274 --> 32:52.942
And she has really come out of
her shell.

32:53.076 --> 32:56.846
She is unbelievable.
She deserves to be here.

32:56.980 --> 33:01.016
I'm so proud of you.
I don't care about that.

33:01.151 --> 33:04.019
You are so awesome.
>> carson: Another hand for

33:04.154 --> 33:06.222
Korin bukowski.
Thank you korin we'll find out

33:06.356 --> 33:08.858
Soon enough.
Appreciate it.

33:08.992 --> 33:13.162
One more performance to go and
then after that we're going to

33:13.296 --> 33:18.401
Open up the instant save window.
Now singing "harder to breathe"

33:18.535 --> 33:22.171
For his last chance to remain in
this competition, also from team

33:22.305 --> 33:26.275
Gwen, please welcome braiden
sunshine.

33:26.410 --> 33:29.645
¶ how dare you say that
my behavior's unacceptable

33:29.780 --> 33:33.983
So condescending
unnecessarily critical ¶

33:34.117 --> 33:36.285
¶ i have the tendency of
getting very physical

33:36.420 --> 33:38.087
So watch your step ¶
¶ 'cause if i do

33:38.221 --> 33:40.022
You'll need a miracle
you drain me dry and

33:40.157 --> 33:42.525
Make me wonder why ¶
¶ i'm even here

33:42.659 --> 33:43.926
This double vision
i was seeing is finally

33:44.060 --> 33:46.128
Clear ¶
¶ you want to stay

33:46.263 --> 33:49.265
But you know very well
i want you gone ¶

33:49.399 --> 33:53.436
¶ not even fit to tread the
ground that i am walking on

33:53.570 --> 33:58.641
When it gets cold outside
and you got nobody to love ¶

33:58.775 --> 34:02.611
¶ you'll understand what
i mean when i say there's

34:02.746 --> 34:06.048
No way we're gonna give up ¶

I have loved you from the

36:03.967 --> 36:07.603

>> i'm amazed but you and your
confidence and your openness.

36:19.215 --> 36:22.251
And i feel like you have grown
so physically on stage, your

36:22.385 --> 36:28.624
Body language.
You are getting looser and more

36:28.758 --> 36:32.261
Tapped in.

I have been honored to know you.

37:42.966 --> 37:45.334
Korin bukowski and braiden
sunshine would like to fill that

37:45.468 --> 37:49.505

In realtime.
I'm encouraging you.

You have time to save one of

37:58.748 --> 38:04.053
These artists.
Let take out the graphic.

38:04.187 --> 38:10.392
And korin this is the third time
you have been in this position.

38:10.527 --> 38:14.530
If this is the night you leave
what do you want to say to gwen?

38:14.664 --> 38:16.598
>> there is so much.
Thank you so much for

38:16.733 --> 38:25.107
Everything.
You have really made me jump out

38:25.241 --> 38:29.411
Of my cocoon and i'm thankful
for you and my fans and

38:29.546 --> 38:32.715
Followers and for god for
putting me on this amazing

38:32.849 --> 38:35.851
Journey.
I feel comforted now.

38:35.985 --> 38:40.789
>> carson: Thank you, korin.
And braiden, what do you want to

38:40.924 --> 38:44.560
Say to your coach who supported
you throughout this entire

38:44.694 --> 38:47.563
Process?
>> you turned around for a

38:47.697 --> 38:49.364
15-year-old.
I never expected that.

38:49.499 --> 38:53.635
I never did.
Thank you so much for that.

38:53.770 --> 38:56.705
I'm just -- just that
validation, just that alone gave

38:56.840 --> 39:00.075
Me so much more confidence.
And there's nothing i can do to

39:00.210 --> 39:02.878
Repay you for that.
You've given me so much more

39:03.012 --> 39:05.013
Than i could have ever imagine
in this period of time just

39:05.148 --> 39:12.454
Thank you.
And if i go home -- thank you.

39:12.589 --> 39:15.891
>> carson: Unfortunately, you
will be losing somebody tonight.

39:16.025 --> 39:19.428
You have two incredible artists
and by what they're saying two

39:19.562 --> 39:22.831
Incredible people.
I know it's especially tough for

39:22.966 --> 39:26.068
You.
But final words potentially to

39:26.202 --> 39:29.037
Korin.
>> it's impossible to pull it

39:29.172 --> 39:32.941
Together right now.
It's intense having two of my

39:33.076 --> 39:36.678
Babies against each other.
But korin, you know, you are

39:36.813 --> 39:39.481
Just -- just knowing you has
been -- like, equally, inspiring

39:39.616 --> 39:43.218
For me.
You know, and i feel like -- i

39:43.353 --> 39:45.721
Said this before, we are very
similar.

39:45.855 --> 39:49.258
We have so much -- we're on the
same journey together.

39:49.392 --> 39:53.061
And it's weird because i just
connect with you so much.

39:53.196 --> 39:59.001
And i'm so proud of you and i
just think it doesn't matter.

39:59.135 --> 40:01.203
Outside of this, like look at
what we've all got already.

40:01.337 --> 40:06.675
This is just a show.
>> carson: Thank you, gwen and

40:06.810 --> 40:08.343
Quickly words for braiden,
please.

40:08.478 --> 40:13.282
>> you, you're 15.
You have your whole life ahead

40:13.416 --> 40:15.984
Of you.
You will continue growing and

40:16.119 --> 40:21.123
Growing and growing.
You are special.

40:21.257 --> 40:23.926
Your personality alone is very
special.

40:24.060 --> 40:36.338
>> carson: Here we go, the
instant save window has closed

40:36.472 --> 40:39.241
And the time has come.
One of you is instantly saved

40:39.375 --> 40:46.448
And the other unfortunately
leaves "the voice" tonight.

40:46.583 --> 40:59.228
[ applause ]
america instantly saved --

40:59.362 --> 41:01.563
