14:54.640 --> 14:56.610
Well, y'all should have seen Uncle Phil.

14:56.780 --> 14:59.800
Dude just went straight loco.

15:00.150 --> 15:03.740
That big vein in his neck
looked like an anaconda.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.410
Look, there's a method
to my father's madness.

15:06.590 --> 15:10.080
If he came down hard on Ashley,
it was for her own good.

15:10.260 --> 15:12.660
Man, you think everything
your father does is right.

15:12.830 --> 15:14.520
Of course, don't you?

15:14.700 --> 15:17.760
Hell, no.

15:20.030 --> 15:21.130
Carlton, Will's right.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.030
Daddy is way too strict.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.930
Well, he may be strict,
but he's always fair.

15:26.110 --> 15:28.270
Yeah, when you're a son.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.430
Well, sons are different than daughters.

15:30.610 --> 15:33.140
In your case, just barely.

15:34.010 --> 15:38.920
If you're referring to the size of my
endowment, it's almost as large as Hilary's.

15:44.460 --> 15:47.260
God, I hope you talking about money.

15:51.370 --> 15:53.700
Yes, thank you. I'll tell him.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.270
Sir, the precinct says
they'll keep looking.

15:58.470 --> 16:01.410
I can't believe she's out there somewhere,
Vivian.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.270
Our little girl.

16:04.210 --> 16:05.910
Sorry, guys, we couldn't find her.

16:07.650 --> 16:09.910
- Will, this is all your fault.
- My fault?

16:10.080 --> 16:12.080
Where else did Ashley learn
such behavior?

16:12.250 --> 16:15.380
Wait a minute. You're the one
that chased Ashley out of here.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.520
How dare you talk to me like that?

16:17.690 --> 16:19.590
He dares because he doesn't respect you.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.790
Neither of them do.

16:24.130 --> 16:25.500
What a crock.

16:25.670 --> 16:28.000
How you go and just tell
a bold-faced lie like...?

16:28.170 --> 16:29.300
<i>HILARY [OVER RECORDER]:
Carlton, Will is right.</i>

16:29.470 --> 16:32.130
<i>Daddy is way too strict.</i>

16:35.340 --> 16:37.810
<i>WILL: Right, you think everything
your father does is right.</i>

16:37.980 --> 16:40.240
<i>CARLTON:
Of course, don't you?</i>

16:40.680 --> 16:43.810
<i>WILL:
Hell, no.</i>

16:44.850 --> 16:48.520
- And listen to this from last week.
- Hey, man, what is wrong with you?

16:51.060 --> 16:52.820
Hey, what up, Ash?

16:59.400 --> 17:00.490
Hi, Will.

17:01.370 --> 17:02.670
[CHUCKLES]

17:05.010 --> 17:08.240
You mean we've been out running
all over this city looking for you...

17:08.410 --> 17:10.310
...and you've been up in here?

17:10.480 --> 17:11.710
Well, I did run away.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.140
But there are some weirdoes out there.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.579
You know something,
this is all your fault.

17:17.079 --> 17:20.420
What is that, like,
the theme of this family?

17:20.720 --> 17:23.250
"When in doubt, blame Will. "

17:23.420 --> 17:26.660
If it wasn't for you, Daddy would never
have found out about that party.

17:26.829 --> 17:29.890
Ashley, that still doesn't mean
that you should have been there.

17:31.370 --> 17:36.230
Ashley, listen,
college boys are like predators.

17:36.400 --> 17:40.670
You know, they prey on innocent little
high school girls like you.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.640
They're like piranha, Ashley.

17:42.810 --> 17:47.800
And you're 110 pounds of teenage chum.

17:49.150 --> 17:52.310
A hundred and eight
and I'm not as innocent as I look.

17:53.950 --> 17:55.820
All right, I am.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.290
Well...

17:58.460 --> 18:01.120
...you ready to walk that last mile?

18:01.430 --> 18:03.730
Will, I didn't do anything.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.270
The Lord is my shepherd...

18:15.740 --> 18:18.680
Hey, everybody, look what I found.

18:26.150 --> 18:27.680
Are you okay?

18:28.360 --> 18:29.550
Yeah, I'm all right.

18:31.160 --> 18:35.150
Now, we've got a bit
of a volatile situation here.

18:36.260 --> 18:38.560
A powder keg if you will.

18:38.970 --> 18:44.400
A mishandling of this situation could have
repercussions that will reverberate forever.

18:45.210 --> 18:46.500
Vivian...

18:46.670 --> 18:50.970
...call your sister and tell her
she's about to lose her only child.

18:51.150 --> 18:53.270
I'm gonna call her and tell her myself.

18:59.620 --> 19:01.090
Look...

19:01.760 --> 19:04.020
...now, I could ground you forever.

19:04.190 --> 19:08.180
I could put bars on your windows,
I could put locks on your doors.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.800
- Daddy...
- Don't "daddy" me.

19:11.200 --> 19:15.260
Do you have any idea
what you put this family through?

19:15.440 --> 19:18.430
Running around doing God knows what
with God knows who.

19:19.540 --> 19:21.670
If I'd have asked,
you wouldn't have let me go.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.710
You're darn right. You're 15 years old.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.940
You have no business at a party
with college boys!

19:28.120 --> 19:32.280
- All my friends were there.
- Your friends don't live here!

19:33.090 --> 19:35.060
I can't do this.

19:35.260 --> 19:37.950
You talk to your daughter. I'm done.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.290
You guys hate me.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.900
Ashley, if that were true, we wouldn't care
when you did something foolish like this.

19:50.070 --> 19:54.470
What you have to understand
is that we know what's best for you.

19:54.640 --> 19:57.700
It may not seem like that now,
but one day you'll understand that.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.850
End of discussion.

20:02.420 --> 20:04.010
Mom, don't you understand?

20:04.180 --> 20:05.910
Yes, I understand.

20:06.090 --> 20:08.820
I understand you lied and you ran away.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.180
And another thing...

20:11.360 --> 20:15.390
...as long as you live in this house,
you will follow our rules.

20:15.560 --> 20:17.360
That's it!

20:22.900 --> 20:24.500
Mom.

20:24.940 --> 20:26.340
[BANGS]

20:28.380 --> 20:31.280
Ashley, I understand what you're feeling.

20:31.450 --> 20:34.900
But you have to consider the seriousness
of what you did.

20:36.850 --> 20:39.580
You really hurt us this evening.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.380
All I want is for you to trust me.

20:44.290 --> 20:46.950
Trust is a very fragile thing...

20:47.290 --> 20:50.890
...and you're gonna have to start
earning it all back.

20:51.930 --> 20:53.630
I messed up really bad.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.860
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.910
Ashley.

21:06.650 --> 21:09.740
Mama, I'm sorry.

21:13.090 --> 21:14.880
I saw Ashley's tutor leaving.

21:15.060 --> 21:18.220
Oh, yeah, they're actually
gonna let Ashley eat tomorrow.

21:19.630 --> 21:22.360
Yeah, that's what happens when you lie.

21:22.530 --> 21:24.000
You gotta be punished.

21:24.670 --> 21:27.030
So, what do you think your punishment
should be?

21:27.940 --> 21:29.530
Oh, I don't know.

21:29.700 --> 21:31.690
I think it should hurt.

21:32.140 --> 21:35.130
I think it should really teach me a lesson.

21:36.640 --> 21:39.610
And I should be wearing
some kind of hat.

21:39.780 --> 21:41.010
You are sick.

21:41.350 --> 21:43.440
Okay, no hat.

21:45.090 --> 21:48.650
- I think people lie because the truth hurts.
- Yeah.

21:48.820 --> 21:52.660
Like, take this jacket you're wearing.

21:52.830 --> 21:54.950
What about this jacket?

21:56.060 --> 21:57.790
I love it.

21:58.305 --> 22:04.450
