00:03.060 --> 00:05.580
Did you hear they started their bus already?
-No?

00:05.580 --> 00:08.720
One month into high
school and they started their bus already.

00:08.960 --> 00:12.040
Ingrid…
I miss you.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.320
You look like a slut.

00:18.180 --> 00:20.000
Maybe I can get a friend?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.860
You invited loads of people on a cabin trip
that was supposed to be just us! -Two guys?!

00:23.860 --> 00:27.540
I can see your messages then.
-I already told you, this is ridiculous!

00:27.560 --> 00:29.160
Why don't you trust me?

01:02.200 --> 01:03.960
I'll call you later, okay?

01:04.740 --> 01:05.380
Yeah.

01:14.060 --> 01:15.240
Eva...

01:15.860 --> 01:17.280
I'm sorry.

01:17.860 --> 01:21.980
If I knew how important this cabin
trip was for you, I wouldn't have invited the guys.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.620
I didn't know it wasn't
that important to you.

01:26.660 --> 01:27.980
It was important to me!

01:33.780 --> 01:35.140
But…

01:39.900 --> 01:42.740
It's also important to
me to spend time with my friends.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.420
It used to be
important to you, too.

01:47.140 --> 01:50.940
It's important to me.
But not as important as your friends.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.360
I told you that
you could bring friends!

02:01.940 --> 02:04.080
Can't you just-
-Get some friends?

02:04.780 --> 02:06.300
That's not what I meant.

02:06.780 --> 02:08.460
But it's what you're thinking.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.260
I don't know
what the right answer is.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.420
Just be completely honest.

02:21.680 --> 02:22.720
Completely honest?

02:28.040 --> 02:31.000
Eva, you are the coolest girl I know.

02:31.380 --> 02:35.120
You're pretty, sweet, smart, and funny.

02:35.440 --> 02:36.540
But…

02:37.140 --> 02:39.500
I don't know what the problem is.

02:39.940 --> 02:42.180
You have to find new friends!

02:42.440 --> 02:44.300
Get yourself new friends!

02:44.740 --> 02:48.640
Anyone who gets to
be your friend is really lucky.

02:53.900 --> 02:57.440
You don't know what to say?
-I nailed it.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.140
You nailed it.

04:10.340 --> 04:16.260
<i>[Congratulations on having me as a friend!]</i>

04:34.820 --> 04:37.640
<i>[Hey girl! What's up?]</i>

05:00.160 --> 05:10.920
<i>[Hi, is what I meant. Wanted to write Hi, but then
I pressed the send button and so it was just H. Haha.]</i>

05:59.300 --> 05:59.860
Hello.

06:01.520 --> 06:02.740
How are you doing?

06:10.600 --> 06:12.360
I'll sit here.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.160
Hi.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.480
Or.. H?

06:21.680 --> 06:22.780
H-H.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.600
Should we have done homework during the fall break?
-Yes!

06:37.440 --> 06:38.400
Fuck!

06:38.640 --> 06:39.500
Eva?

06:39.960 --> 06:43.400
What does the main
character of this story do?

06:52.300 --> 06:54.500
She feels alone.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.820
Noora, I don't want you to respond for Eva.

06:58.180 --> 07:01.320
She hadn't found her homework yet.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.720
I was just helping.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.320
You asked it the wrong way.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.540
The right way would be:

07:07.680 --> 07:10.700
What are the main
characters of the story like?

07:10.700 --> 07:12.700
You're right. I'm sorry!

07:14.380 --> 07:16.760
I lived in Madrid.
Okay, okay.

07:18.220 --> 07:21.560
That's why I don't have friends.
In Oslo.

07:27.140 --> 07:29.100
What's your excuse?

07:32.180 --> 07:33.860
Strong body odor.

07:41.680 --> 07:44.840
Culturally.

07:59.960 --> 08:00.800
Hi!

08:01.160 --> 08:02.820
Thanks for last time.
-Hi!

08:02.860 --> 08:05.840
I can't remember if I greeted
you properly. I was a little out of it.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.240
Vilde.
-Eva.

08:10.480 --> 08:13.640
It was so nice of
you to help me!

08:13.720 --> 08:15.640
No, no. It was nothing!

08:15.840 --> 08:18.640
We were wondering
if you already had a Russ bus.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.440
Eh, no.

08:20.440 --> 08:24.920
That's perfect! We just rented a
completely new bus. We really want you to join.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.280
I haven't really started
thinking about Russ time.

08:30.240 --> 08:34.580
It's really important to think about it
if you want to be on a bus.

08:34.680 --> 08:40.100
I don't know what it's like in Trondheim,
but here in Oslo you have to start planning really early.

08:40.100 --> 08:44.060
Otherwise you end up on a
bad bus, or you become a gå-russ.
<i>(= graduate not participating in bus activities)</i>

08:44.940 --> 08:51.140
Being a Russ is not just about Russ time,
it's also about being social and about unity.

08:55.040 --> 08:59.820
Yes, think of it a like a sect.
Once you're in, you can't get out.

08:59.840 --> 09:06.220
It ends in a collective suicide in Tryvann,
on the night of the 17th of May in 2018.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.720
She's just joking.

09:09.700 --> 09:13.360
Do you perhaps want to join
our bus meeting Friday after school?

09:15.800 --> 09:18.120
Yeah, yeah ok.
-Yeah?

09:18.220 --> 09:22.260
That's so cool! If you
have friends, just take them with you!

09:25.760 --> 09:27.220
We'll see each other then.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.980
What the fuck was that?

09:44.300 --> 09:45.360
What is it?

09:45.360 --> 09:49.020
She was sucking on that spoon
and looking him straight in the eyes.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.580
Who is she?

10:03.820 --> 10:07.580
H. As in, "Have you got a drug problem?"

10:07.940 --> 10:11.540
Or H as in, "Have you got any plans for Friday?"

10:11.540 --> 10:12.520
Hi!

10:17.180 --> 10:19.180
Vilde, this is Noora.

10:19.960 --> 10:20.800
Hi.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.780
Have you talked to Chris?
-No.

10:23.780 --> 10:27.540
We can't have the bus meeting
at hers, her mom is having a wine reception.

10:27.540 --> 10:30.360
And we can't have it
at mine because it'll be stressful for me.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.580
So I was wondering
if we can do it at yours?

10:32.760 --> 10:33.460
Mine?

10:34.000 --> 10:38.440
Eh, yes! But how
many will come?

10:38.660 --> 10:40.520
Do you want to join?

10:40.520 --> 10:42.400
What?
-Bus meeting.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.600
Bus meeting… what?

10:44.600 --> 10:48.720
We'll create the world's coolest
Russ bus. You want to join?

10:48.880 --> 10:49.860
No.

10:53.720 --> 10:54.880
Then we're with three…

10:55.020 --> 10:58.840
Hi guys. Meet Sana.
She'll join the bus meeting.

11:04.740 --> 11:06.820
Where do you know each other from?

11:07.160 --> 11:09.280
We met at a Ramadan
programme in the mosque.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.040
She's joking. We have German together.

11:19.080 --> 11:22.300
But you want to join our bus meeting?

11:22.300 --> 11:23.040
Yes.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.780
Is that okay, then?

11:30.260 --> 11:31.720
What's the problem?

11:32.080 --> 11:33.880
No, eh…

11:34.260 --> 11:42.260
Since you're Muslim, isn't it true that
Muslims aren't allowed to be a Russ?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.420
No, it's punished by stoning.

11:49.780 --> 11:52.620
When is it?
-Tomorrow. Who's hosting?

11:53.000 --> 11:53.620
Me.

11:53.620 --> 11:57.360
I'll put your address in the GPS.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.000
Auf Wiedersehen!

12:04.240 --> 12:06.060
It means "see you later".

12:07.040 --> 12:10.680
She can't be on our bus.
-Why not?

12:11.000 --> 12:14.320
We'll give her a chance.
She was really cool.

12:14.720 --> 12:15.640
We?

12:15.900 --> 12:17.700
You're not even on our bus.

12:17.780 --> 12:20.120
If she's joining, so am I.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.000
Awesome!

12:37.400 --> 12:43.600
We have a really big advantage over the other
bus groups. I already bought a lot of toilet paper.

12:43.600 --> 12:48.320
Vilde managed to buy toilet paper
for 40.000 Kroner with a credit card from another bus.

12:49.540 --> 12:53.160
Anyway, we're left with
a profit of 60.000 Kroner.

12:53.160 --> 13:01.840
According to the budget, we'll
need 50.000 next to the toilet paper sales.

13:01.940 --> 13:07.260
So I'll need an individual plan from
all of you on how you'll earn that money.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.020
Is there something?

13:11.020 --> 13:16.580
We're wasting time on
toilet paper. It's not enough.

13:16.580 --> 13:20.360
It's important that we have

13:20.360 --> 13:26.980
Listen, we're losers at school. If we don't
want to end up in a loser car, we need a strategy.

13:26.980 --> 13:31.460
We aren't the losers of the school.
-Wasn't it you who was thrown out of another bus?

13:31.640 --> 13:34.300
Not really thrown out.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.200
Yes you were.

13:37.020 --> 13:43.520
Listen, Vilde. It'll be hard if you
deny everything. Acknowledge that we're losers.

13:44.020 --> 13:46.080
Do you think so yourself?

13:46.400 --> 13:51.780
Hello?! I'm a Muslim girl in a faithless country.
I'm the biggest loser of them all.

13:52.080 --> 13:55.080
You talk really maturely.
-Thanks.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.380
But what do you want us to do?

13:59.200 --> 14:03.400
First, we need to get more girls.
Cool girls.

14:03.400 --> 14:04.880
How do we do that?

14:06.180 --> 14:07.880
Ask them?
-Wrong.

14:08.020 --> 14:10.720
We ask nothing.
The cool girls ask us.

14:11.820 --> 14:14.820
But first, we need something we don't have.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.180
A four-letter word.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.040
"Spenn."
-Cred.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.100
Spenn has five letters, Chris.

14:23.100 --> 14:25.240
Do we know any '97 guys?

14:30.640 --> 14:31.560
Okay..

14:31.560 --> 14:37.980
Then we need to find out who from the '97 people have
the best bus, get ourselves invited to parties and to those busses.

14:38.380 --> 14:40.900
Any idea how we'll do that?

14:44.180 --> 14:45.620
You guys have to hook up with them.

14:45.620 --> 14:46.840
Are you serious?

14:46.840 --> 14:49.120
"You guys"?
-I'm not hooking up!

14:49.320 --> 14:52.720
Okay, so we'll hook up.
What will you contribute?

14:52.720 --> 14:59.740
Are you kidding me? I'm rescuing you here with
a strategic plan and you're wondering what I'll contribute?

15:02.420 --> 15:03.980
Does anyone have a boyfriend?

15:04.600 --> 15:05.580
I do.

15:05.940 --> 15:07.380
How old is he?

15:08.100 --> 15:09.180
He's from '99.

15:09.820 --> 15:10.760
Dump him.

15:11.540 --> 15:13.780
You're not serious?

15:13.860 --> 15:18.120
She's the prettiest here.
It's wasted if she has a boyfriend.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.800
Honestly. This is really stupid.

15:24.940 --> 15:25.820
What is?

15:26.180 --> 15:32.540
You can't ask us to use our
sexuality in exchange for credibility.

15:33.080 --> 15:36.520
You're crazy.
-No, I'm honest.

15:36.520 --> 15:41.220
Norwegian girls exchange sex for money,
popularity, and acknowledgement every day.

15:41.220 --> 15:48.140
We might disagree on values. But this
isn't news to you! It's your culture.

15:48.280 --> 15:53.300
It is crazy. So try to change it
instead of criticising it.

16:00.380 --> 16:03.920
But it's a little much to
ask Eva to break up with her boyfriend.

16:03.920 --> 16:11.460
It was a suggestion. She can think
for herself. She's not a child.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.260
I think it went well.
