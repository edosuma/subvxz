00:01.600 --> 00:05.490
ANNOUNCER: Previously
on "Big Brother,"

00:05.490 --> 00:07.930
after a pool game got ugly--

00:07.930 --> 00:10.140
No, that's a scratch.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.840
You just double-hit the ball.
- Redo it.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.510
Redo it.

00:13.510 --> 00:14.260
Redo it.

00:14.260 --> 00:17.010
ANNOUNCER: Mark and
Josh went toe to toe.

00:17.010 --> 00:18.920
- Yes.

00:18.920 --> 00:19.620
OK.

00:23.130 --> 00:26.380
But when Jessica inserted
herself into the melee--

00:26.380 --> 00:30.030
You lied to me, so your
word now means nothing.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.610
Josh unleashed
his wrath on her.

00:32.610 --> 00:35.580
You turned on us on the flip,
because Cody convinces you.

00:35.580 --> 00:37.950
And now that Cody's gone, you
want to reinsert yourself.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.270
Booboo, it's not a
good look for you.

00:39.270 --> 00:41.970
Don't call me
booboo, sweetheart.

00:41.970 --> 00:43.590
ANNOUNCER: With the
Den of Temptation

00:43.590 --> 00:45.990
opening for the final time--

00:45.990 --> 00:47.960
Come on, America.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.820
ANNOUNCER: --America tempted
Jess with the Halting Hex.

00:50.820 --> 00:52.930
The Halting Hex will
allow you to halt any one

00:52.930 --> 00:54.510
of the next four evictions.

00:54.510 --> 00:56.580
ANNOUNCER: And she
gladly accepted.

00:56.580 --> 01:01.590
Halting Hex rise,
eviction night dies.

01:01.590 --> 01:03.630
ANNOUNCER: After Dominique
was shown the door--

01:03.630 --> 01:08.610
JULIE CHEN: By a vote
of 10-0, Dominique,

01:08.610 --> 01:12.250
you are evicted from
the "Big Brother" house.

01:12.250 --> 01:15.580
ANNOUNCER: --she joined Cameron,
Jillian, and Cody for a chance

01:15.580 --> 01:16.990
to battle back.

01:16.990 --> 01:19.740
But this time, there
was a new twist.

01:19.740 --> 01:21.610
JULIE CHEN: In a
"Big Brother" first,

01:21.610 --> 01:26.380
this Battle Back will
end in a showdown, you

01:26.380 --> 01:30.940
again a challenger
from the house.

01:30.940 --> 01:34.370
ANNOUNCER: Cody and Cameron
advanced past the first battle.

01:34.370 --> 01:36.420
JULIE CHEN:
Congratulations, Cameron.

01:36.420 --> 01:37.120
Yes!

01:37.120 --> 01:41.650
JULIE CHEN: You and Cody
both advance to round two.

01:41.650 --> 01:45.660
ANNOUNCER: Sending them
to a do-or-die face-off.

01:45.660 --> 01:49.060
And the Marine bested
the microbiologist.

01:49.060 --> 01:51.220
JULIE CHEN:
Congratulations, Cody.

01:51.220 --> 01:55.090
You are advancing to the
final battle of the night.

01:55.090 --> 01:56.560
Good job, man.

01:56.560 --> 01:59.440
ANNOUNCER: After the HouseGuests
learned the shocking news--

01:59.440 --> 02:02.530
JULIE CHEN: For the first
time in "Big Brother" history,

02:02.530 --> 02:05.410
you as a house will
have the chance

02:05.410 --> 02:11.070
to stop this evicted HouseGuest
dead in his or her tracks.

02:11.070 --> 02:11.770
Nice.

02:11.770 --> 02:13.980
ANNOUNCER: --they voted
on a house challenger.

02:13.980 --> 02:15.160
- I vote for Paul.
- Paul.

02:15.160 --> 02:15.820
- Paul.
- Paul.

02:15.820 --> 02:16.780
Paul.

02:16.780 --> 02:21.170
ANNOUNCER: Setting the
stage for Cody versus Paul.

02:21.170 --> 02:26.010
And by the end of the showdown,
the sniper took out the rocker.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.090
JULIE CHEN:
Congratulations, Cody.

02:29.090 --> 02:32.460
You have won the
Battle Back Showdown.

02:32.460 --> 02:34.870
And you are back in the game.

02:34.870 --> 02:37.700
ANNOUNCER: Tonight, how will
the house react as the Marine

02:37.700 --> 02:39.500
returns to active duty?

02:39.500 --> 02:43.640
Plus, who will rise to power
as the new Head of Household,

02:43.640 --> 02:47.570
and which two HouseGuests will
be nominated for eviction?

02:47.570 --> 02:51.830
Find out right now
on "Big Brother."

02:51.830 --> 02:54.050
I can't say I lost
every competition.

02:54.050 --> 02:56.830
I came in second in one.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.100
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

03:41.100 --> 03:43.970
Cody's back, and
I'm so excited.

03:43.970 --> 03:45.520
This is a dream come true.

03:45.520 --> 03:49.370
Him being back in this game
changes everything for me.

03:49.370 --> 03:52.760
And I've got my cuddle buddy
back, so it's a win-win.

03:52.760 --> 03:55.540
I just won three competitions,
and now I'm back in the house.

03:55.540 --> 03:58.330
So the first time around,
I just took big risks.

03:58.330 --> 04:01.730
I had to nominate five
people my first HOH.

04:01.730 --> 04:05.110
So, the amount of blood
on my hands is enormous.

04:05.110 --> 04:07.910
This time around, I'm
going to listen to Jessica.

04:07.910 --> 04:10.630
I'm back in the running
for this 500,000.

04:10.630 --> 04:12.290
Let's see how far I
can get this time.

04:14.980 --> 04:15.680
Hell, no.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.030
It's a wonder he
was as coherent.

04:17.030 --> 04:18.300
Great.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.320
Fantastic.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.150
Absolutely wonderful.

04:21.150 --> 04:22.920
I got him out of
this house once,

04:22.920 --> 04:25.610
and now I gotta do it
all over again, only

04:25.610 --> 04:27.720
he's slightly more pissed off.

04:27.720 --> 04:28.820
Well, it is what it is.

04:28.820 --> 04:29.520
Sorry guys.

04:33.180 --> 04:37.010
I'm really sorry, everyone,
but I have some kissing to do.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.120
You all have fun.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.040
If you hear animal
noises, don't come.

04:53.320 --> 04:54.250
Come sit with me.

05:04.550 --> 05:06.350
--there was anybody
that came back.

05:06.350 --> 05:07.700
Right.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.650
Kevin had my back.

05:10.650 --> 05:11.830
Josh was like--

05:15.550 --> 05:16.780
Jess, I'm gonna
make it very clear.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.850
I respect you, but if
I win HOH, you're going

05:18.850 --> 05:20.170
home, just so the house knows.

05:20.170 --> 05:21.000
And just so you know.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.090
Josh, why do you
always do this?

05:26.090 --> 05:27.050
Every time.

05:27.050 --> 05:28.900
Oh, it's exciting for me.
I get a thrill.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.180
Just stop.

05:30.180 --> 05:31.350
I don't want to
give you my vote,

05:31.350 --> 05:34.910
but I'm sending
you home next week.

05:34.910 --> 05:38.250
You've lied on everybody.

05:38.250 --> 05:43.440
Jason has been so
good to me all week.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.810
Wow.

05:44.810 --> 05:49.010
What if I told you that if
you don't win HOH and someone

05:49.010 --> 05:53.370
puts us on the block, maybe
America gave me a power.

05:53.370 --> 05:55.790
Shut--

06:04.480 --> 06:06.920
So if you and I get
put up on the block

06:06.920 --> 06:11.410
in the next three weeks, I can
literally halt the eviction.

06:11.410 --> 06:14.330
And then we both
stay in the game.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.750
What?

06:15.750 --> 06:18.540
I can't believe Jessica
got the temptation.

06:18.540 --> 06:19.880
This is incredible.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.150
And not only is it
something that benefits her,

06:22.150 --> 06:23.860
but it benefits both of us.

06:23.860 --> 06:28.570
It's a pleasant surprise
to know that for once--

06:28.570 --> 06:29.940
at least one week
in this house--

06:29.940 --> 06:30.640
I have safety.

06:42.230 --> 06:43.890
I'm playing your game.

06:43.890 --> 06:45.940
If Cody and I are going
to survive in this game,

06:45.940 --> 06:47.560
he cannot go rogue again.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.940
So we're going to play this
one like a team this time.

06:49.940 --> 06:51.340
I've spent the last
seven days repairing

06:51.340 --> 06:54.380
my relationship with
literally every single person

06:54.380 --> 06:55.490
in this house.

06:55.490 --> 06:56.500
So it's like a reset.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.620
That's incredible.

07:01.620 --> 07:06.550
Alex, Josh, Christmas, Paul--

07:06.550 --> 07:08.930
all four of them have to go.

07:08.930 --> 07:11.340
If you win HOH, we
can literally go

07:11.340 --> 07:14.160
from the bottom of the barrel
to running this house again.

07:14.160 --> 07:19.170
You give me whatever
move, and I'll make it, OK?

07:19.170 --> 07:21.070
My move is winning HOH.

07:26.030 --> 07:29.080
Ah.
It's all right.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.680
I'm very proud of you, Paul.

07:35.130 --> 07:37.200
Well, guys--

07:37.200 --> 07:38.820
Back to square one.

07:38.820 --> 07:41.220
I am not excited about Cody
getting back in the house.

07:41.220 --> 07:44.970
It is uncomfortable, it is
scary, and he has his ride

07:44.970 --> 07:47.600
or die again.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.870
Jessica and Cody, super-threat.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.000
I think he's
going to try really

07:51.000 --> 07:52.470
hard to reinsert
himself in the house

07:52.470 --> 07:55.240
and, like, be really social.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.000
Oh, yeah.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.350
He's changed his ways that
he's playing this game.

08:01.740 --> 08:04.470
But the hostility levels
dropped immediately.

08:04.470 --> 08:06.650
Like, the house was
just, like, so--

08:06.650 --> 08:08.330
Yeah.
It was just bad.

08:08.330 --> 08:09.030
Bad air.

08:19.090 --> 08:20.660
What do you mean no?

08:20.660 --> 08:22.440
No.
No.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.420
- No, no, no.

08:25.420 --> 08:29.220
Me and Cody and Jess had a
rough relationship before.

08:29.220 --> 08:32.680
So I don't know if I want
to stir the pot again.

08:32.680 --> 08:36.120
Maybe Mr. and Mrs. Meatball have
been through enough already.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.950
I don't want to get into an
argument with them no more.

08:37.950 --> 08:38.680
That's all I'm saying.

08:38.680 --> 08:40.560
The reason why is because
you're the only person

08:40.560 --> 08:43.120
who truly gets under his skin.

08:43.120 --> 08:43.840
Look, guys.

08:43.840 --> 08:44.710
Remember Cody?

08:44.710 --> 08:46.200
Public enemy number one?

08:46.200 --> 08:47.800
He's still public
enemy number one.

08:47.800 --> 08:51.550
Because if he wins HOH, you
and I are going on the block.

08:51.550 --> 08:53.300
Just know that.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.050
So, even though we're
all pissed that he's back

08:55.050 --> 08:58.660
in the house, we gotta rally
together, work as a team,

08:58.660 --> 09:00.520
and get him right back out.

09:00.520 --> 09:04.090
It's literally up to every
single person in this room,

09:04.090 --> 09:05.950
minus Alex, to change that.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.380
When we win this
competition, there is no need

09:11.380 --> 09:12.590
to talk in the HOH room.

09:12.590 --> 09:14.340
There's no need to do anything.

09:14.340 --> 09:15.420
I think it's clear.

09:15.420 --> 09:22.800
10 against 2-- so if we
drop that ball, we blew it.

09:33.130 --> 09:34.120
Hey, everyone.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.080
It's time for the
HOH competition.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.530
Let's head to the backyard!
Yeah!

09:51.830 --> 09:52.870
Woo!

09:52.870 --> 09:54.940
Everything's been going
fine and dandy so far.

09:54.940 --> 09:56.710
All my plans have
been completed.

09:56.710 --> 09:58.890
Dominique is out of this house.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.980
But Cody got back
in, and now all

10:00.980 --> 10:02.600
the vibes just got mixed up.

10:02.600 --> 10:06.170
And to put the cherry on
top, my Pendant of Protection

10:06.170 --> 10:07.100
just ran out of gas.

10:07.100 --> 10:10.130
So I really gotta win
this next HOH competition

10:10.130 --> 10:13.060
and bring things back to order
and send Cody right back out.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.450
I just won the Battle Back
to get back into the house.

10:18.450 --> 10:21.930
There's no doubt in my mind that
I am the main target for pretty

10:21.930 --> 10:23.790
much the majority of the house.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.770
What better way to really strike
fear into the hearts of people

10:26.770 --> 10:30.660
if I get the HOH or
Jess gets the HOH?

10:30.660 --> 10:32.340
Welcome back to Evictionville.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.530
If you want to guarantee you
don't end up here next week,

10:34.530 --> 10:36.030
you'll need to stop
traffic in tonight's

10:36.030 --> 10:37.740
Head of Household Competition.

10:37.740 --> 10:38.970
Here's how it works.

10:38.970 --> 10:40.470
Each of you will hold
up your red traffic

10:40.470 --> 10:43.170
light disc by pressing it with
your glove and clear pole.

10:43.170 --> 10:44.700
Your goal is to stand
on your platform

10:44.700 --> 10:47.640
while keeping the red disc
in place as long as possible.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.070
If your disc falls,
you will be eliminated.

10:50.070 --> 10:51.810
Being a traffic
cop is no easy job,

10:51.810 --> 10:53.940
because you have to deal with
plenty of disgruntled people

10:53.940 --> 10:55.390
all night long.

10:55.390 --> 10:57.630
So each time someone is
eliminated, that person will

10:57.630 --> 11:00.360
choose one of the HouseGuests
still in the game to punish,

11:00.360 --> 11:02.520
making their job even harder.

11:02.520 --> 11:03.990
The last player holding
up their red disc

11:03.990 --> 11:05.880
will become the new
Head of Household.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.780
Who's ready to play
What's the Hold Up?

11:12.480 --> 11:15.150
My soul is on fire right now.

11:15.150 --> 11:16.590
I can compete.

11:16.590 --> 11:17.970
I can play.

11:17.970 --> 11:22.210
I want HOH, not just
to send Cody home,

11:22.210 --> 11:27.210
but to show them even with a
broken foot I can play hard.

11:27.210 --> 11:29.040
And the game is on.

11:38.400 --> 11:42.180
Now that Cody is back, it is
us against this entire house

11:42.180 --> 11:43.840
all over again.

11:43.840 --> 11:46.920
Even though America graced
me with this Halting Hex,

11:46.920 --> 11:48.510
I'm not ready to use it.

11:48.510 --> 11:50.880
I would love to win
HOH so Cody and I

11:50.880 --> 11:52.890
can be sure that we
have safety this week

11:52.890 --> 11:55.050
and postpone using
our temptation.

12:14.370 --> 12:16.770
In this HOH
competition, we need

12:16.770 --> 12:20.510
to hold up this red traffic
light with a flimsy stick

12:20.510 --> 12:22.080
for as long as possible.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.180
Whoever drops their
red light is out.

12:24.180 --> 12:27.790
And the last one
standing is the new HOH.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.990
It's the whole house
versus Jess and Cody.

12:30.990 --> 12:34.240
I want this HOH so I can be
the one to take the shot.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.670
Going into this
competition, my strategy--

12:41.670 --> 12:45.110
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

12:45.110 --> 12:47.350
I cannot believe it.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.630
Kevin is the first eliminated.

12:49.630 --> 12:50.900
That's all right, Kevin.

12:50.900 --> 12:51.970
Kevin, come on over.

12:55.430 --> 12:57.940
Kevin, this
competition just started.

12:57.940 --> 13:00.820
How do you already drop--

13:00.820 --> 13:03.240
And mark is out.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.740
We're not even a minute in.

13:04.740 --> 13:05.870
Kevin's down.

13:05.870 --> 13:06.780
Mark's down.

13:06.780 --> 13:09.370
But it's all right guys, I got--

13:09.370 --> 13:10.420
Son of a bitch.

13:13.540 --> 13:14.430
Just kidding.

13:14.430 --> 13:16.760
I totally don't got this.

13:16.760 --> 13:17.460
OK, Kevin.

13:17.460 --> 13:20.820
Who would you like to punish?

13:20.820 --> 13:22.500
Well, since he's
the first black, Cody,

13:22.500 --> 13:25.580
nothing against you, pal.

13:25.580 --> 13:27.320
You've got traffic
backed up for miles.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.540
And this sanitation
worker thinks you stink.

13:29.540 --> 13:32.910
Unfortunately, he has to
put the trash somewhere.

13:32.910 --> 13:36.100
Nothing personal, Cody.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.600
Oh my god, that stinks.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.240
Oh my god.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.760
Yeah, but they're not
going to hit him with it.

13:42.760 --> 13:45.410
- Oh my god.
- Good god.

13:45.410 --> 13:48.550
As this trash is being
dumped on me, sure, it smells.

13:48.550 --> 13:50.110
But the worst part
is, it's covering

13:50.110 --> 13:51.460
the back of the platform.

13:51.460 --> 13:54.310
I can't really adjust
my feet anymore.

13:54.310 --> 13:58.170
That is absolutely disgusting.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.880
I am trying to hold
this thing up here.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.910
But of course I'm
standing next to Cody.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.900
And this trash is horrendous.

14:05.900 --> 14:11.030
There are no words to describe
how truly horrible this smells.

14:11.030 --> 14:11.730
P-U!

14:19.720 --> 14:21.710
Who would you like to
give your punishment to?

14:21.710 --> 14:23.210
Cody, I love you, brother.

14:23.210 --> 14:26.100
Everybody's on board with
getting Cody out this week.

14:26.100 --> 14:28.250
So of course I'm going to
pick Cody for that punishment.

14:28.250 --> 14:30.790
Thanks to you, Randy is
late for his yoga class,

14:30.790 --> 14:33.240
and he's developed a
bad case of road rage.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.350
Now I'm late for yoga.

14:35.350 --> 14:37.160
Do you think I look
this good by waiting

14:37.160 --> 14:39.160
around, sitting doing nothing?

14:39.160 --> 14:40.940
You've got to be kidding me.

14:40.940 --> 14:44.060
Some of us have lives!

14:44.060 --> 14:45.740
I got this guy yelling at me.

14:45.740 --> 14:48.360
As any Marine can tell you, you
get yelled at a million times

14:48.360 --> 14:49.390
in the Marine Corps.

14:49.390 --> 14:51.260
So this has no effect on me.

14:51.260 --> 14:52.780
Knock, knock.

14:52.780 --> 14:53.680
Who's there?

14:53.680 --> 14:57.090
Some friggin' idiot
who's holding up Knock

14:57.090 --> 15:00.840
This big guy is yelling at
the top of his lungs to Cody,

15:00.840 --> 15:01.540
and I'm loving it.

15:01.540 --> 15:03.770
You have got to
be kidding me, pal.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.890
At this point, I want to drop
my stick and join this guy.

15:06.890 --> 15:09.430
I want to go yell at this
kid for a good five minutes.

15:09.430 --> 15:13.180
I am this close to
friggin' blowing up.

15:13.180 --> 15:17.230
If you don't shut up
and go do some yoga.

15:17.230 --> 15:19.540
Sorry, Cody.
I'm following the trend.

15:19.540 --> 15:21.030
The construction
crew hates being

15:21.030 --> 15:22.460
held up by your incompetence.

15:22.460 --> 15:24.770
And their hate for
you is very concrete.

15:24.770 --> 15:27.550
Please don't get that on me.

15:27.550 --> 15:29.600
I assumed that
everyone is going

15:29.600 --> 15:31.160
to give the punishment to me.

15:31.160 --> 15:35.120
Didn't realize that I am pretty
good in endurance competitions.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.870
And therefore I'm going to be
the target the rest of the time

15:37.870 --> 15:39.290
I'm in this game.

15:39.290 --> 15:40.280
It is what it is.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.040
I can tune it out.

15:54.110 --> 15:56.120
Two minutes in, I twitch.

15:56.120 --> 16:00.400
The gosh-dang thing
falls, and I'm pissed.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.680
Jason, as the fourth
eliminated, it's now your turn.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.400
Who would you like to
give a punishment to?

16:05.400 --> 16:07.730
Cody's gotten the
first three punishments,

16:07.730 --> 16:10.460
and it has not affected
him whatsoever.

16:10.460 --> 16:11.210
Jess.

16:11.210 --> 16:15.680
If you attack his
princess, , it might

16:15.680 --> 16:17.510
change his disposition
a little bit

16:17.510 --> 16:20.660
to where he falters and falls.

16:20.660 --> 16:22.340
Just because you're
on the job doesn't mean

16:22.340 --> 16:24.860
you can't enjoy a bit of art.

16:24.860 --> 16:27.560
Everyone is trying
to distract Cody and I,

16:27.560 --> 16:29.310
but we have a
bigger purpose here.

16:29.310 --> 16:31.310
And we are not going
to allow these people

16:31.310 --> 16:32.180
to tear us apart again.

16:37.140 --> 16:38.500
Come on, everybody.

16:44.140 --> 16:47.320
As a radio personality and
someone who's just easily

16:47.320 --> 16:50.740
distracted, this is the
longest I've ever gone

16:50.740 --> 16:53.230
standing still and not talking.

16:53.230 --> 16:55.410
I can't take it anymore.

16:58.120 --> 16:58.820
Damn.

17:07.100 --> 17:09.000
Hello, Elena.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.900
As fifth out, who would you
like to give your punishment to?

17:12.900 --> 17:15.600
I guess Cody.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.730
Harry the hot dog vendor
is running late because

17:17.730 --> 17:19.230
of your stupid traffic jam.

17:19.230 --> 17:21.270
He's hoping he can "catch
up" even though you

17:21.270 --> 17:22.170
can't cut the mustard.

17:29.220 --> 17:31.540
They're throwing ketchup
and mustard on Cody.

17:31.540 --> 17:32.550
Screw that.

17:32.550 --> 17:34.690
Grab the marinara and the
mozzarella cheese, baby,

17:34.690 --> 17:36.910
and throw it on this meatball.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.590
Oh my god.

17:54.590 --> 17:56.180
You got it, girl.

17:56.180 --> 17:58.380
I have a cast
digging into my shin.

17:58.380 --> 18:00.100
My foot is throbbing.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.580
I am one week out from surgery.

18:02.580 --> 18:07.190
But I need to just block out
everything else in my mind

18:07.190 --> 18:07.890
and get HOH.

18:19.690 --> 18:21.060
And Matt is next to fall.

18:24.210 --> 18:27.170
Hey, Matt, who would you like
to give your punishment to?

18:27.170 --> 18:30.980
Cody, I love you, bud.

18:30.980 --> 18:35.450
Cody has been a punching bag
in this game for way too long.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.500
Seeing everyone enforce
their punishments on him

18:42.500 --> 18:44.000
is just fueling my fire.

18:50.550 --> 18:54.660
- Raven has been eliminated.
- Sorry, bud.

18:54.660 --> 18:56.960
Cody.

18:56.960 --> 19:00.710
Will you please explain to me
what the friggin' hold

19:00.710 --> 19:04.870
If this light doesn't turn
green, I'm gonna turn red.

19:04.870 --> 19:06.360
My head's gonna explode.

19:06.360 --> 19:13.430
I'm gonna get mad in five,
four, three, two, one!

19:13.430 --> 19:14.900
People keep punishing me.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.670
I'm not sure why they're
so happy about it,

19:16.670 --> 19:18.740
because every time I
get punished, that's

19:18.740 --> 19:20.330
one less person I have to beat.

19:20.330 --> 19:22.340
So, I mean, who's
really winning?

19:25.190 --> 19:27.100
Raven, go ahead
and have a seat.

19:28.520 --> 19:32.970
It's down to Josh, Ramses,
Christmas, Jessica, and Cody.

19:40.110 --> 19:42.120
My legs and my
arms are going numb.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.560
I'm getting exhausted.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.490
But I'm not letting go, because
Jess and Cody can't win.

19:55.350 --> 19:56.600
How about that, Josh?

19:56.600 --> 19:58.170
How about that?

19:58.170 --> 20:01.310
Josh is off his red light.

20:01.310 --> 20:04.950
Step on up, Josh.

20:04.950 --> 20:08.970
And who would you like
to choose for distraction?

20:08.970 --> 20:09.670
Jessica.

20:12.250 --> 20:13.810
Jessica it is.

20:13.810 --> 20:16.480
So, even though I picked
Jess for the punishment,

20:16.480 --> 20:19.690
I'm going to give these two the
worst nightmare of their lives.

20:19.690 --> 20:22.470
It's about to be a
punishment for two, baby.

20:22.470 --> 20:25.830
Hey, you meatball,
how you feeling, buddy?

20:25.830 --> 20:28.190
You feel like a pack
of meatballs yet?

20:28.190 --> 20:28.940
Look at Jess.

20:28.940 --> 20:30.780
They're dumping-- on her.

20:30.780 --> 20:32.060
Save your girl.

20:32.060 --> 20:33.940
What type of guy are
you, you big meatball?

20:36.940 --> 20:38.660
Look at your girl.

20:38.660 --> 20:41.300
She's got goop on her.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.850
You look like a
pack of meatballs.

20:47.190 --> 20:48.640
It's about to go down.

20:48.640 --> 20:52.920
The meatball dance is
happening, and I'm going off.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.900
Cody.
A Hey, buddy.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.860
You pack of meatballs.

20:56.860 --> 20:59.280
You ready to go back
out that door again?

20:59.280 --> 20:59.980
Huh?

21:10.860 --> 21:13.170
You look like
a pack of meatballs.

21:13.170 --> 21:15.390
You're about to drop it, baby.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.190
I still love you guys, though.

21:29.700 --> 21:33.540
You look like
a pack of meatballs.

21:37.230 --> 21:39.010
Cody, how bad do you
hate me right now?

21:39.010 --> 21:40.540
Say something.

21:40.540 --> 21:42.580
I've tuned out Josh
completely in the "Big

21:42.580 --> 21:43.900
Brother" game altogether.

21:43.900 --> 21:46.010
Oh, you're feeling shaky.

21:46.010 --> 21:48.420
Your feet are wobbling.

21:48.420 --> 21:50.650
The guy is
psychotic, so I'm not

21:50.650 --> 21:53.050
too concerned about
anything that Josh says

21:53.050 --> 21:56.870
or does in this game anymore.

21:56.870 --> 21:59.740
Christmas, if it's
any constellation--

21:59.740 --> 22:01.240
constellation?

22:01.240 --> 22:05.940
Uh, if I was to win HOH,
you're not my target.

22:05.940 --> 22:07.860
And I meant it when I said
that I wanted to squash

22:07.860 --> 22:10.320
everything between us.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.160
I appreciate that.

22:15.440 --> 22:16.570
Cody?

22:16.570 --> 22:19.830
Same, same, same.

22:19.830 --> 22:22.570
Jessica and Cody tell me
that I'm not their target,

22:22.570 --> 22:23.710
and I appreciate it.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.570
I can't tell them the
same thing, because I'm

22:25.570 --> 22:27.010
not going to lie to them.

22:27.010 --> 22:31.110
I still want the HOH for me.
- Elena.

22:42.270 --> 22:47.120
I'm gonna give you a foot
rub, a back massage, a pizza--

22:47.120 --> 22:48.470
everything you want.

22:48.470 --> 22:50.350
Just don't make a deal
with the meatball.

23:07.970 --> 23:10.170
Cody, you've been eliminated.

23:10.170 --> 23:13.500
- One more to go, baby.
- Boom.

23:13.500 --> 23:15.300
Finally, Cody's out.

23:15.300 --> 23:17.880
Now all we need is either
Christmas or Ramses

23:17.880 --> 23:22.930
to take this HOH home and get
Jessica out of the competition.

23:22.930 --> 23:25.110
Cody, as ninth
out, who would you

23:25.110 --> 23:26.540
like to give a punishment to?

23:26.540 --> 23:27.600
Ramses.

23:27.600 --> 23:31.530
The graffiti artist is back,
and he wants to tag dat ass.

23:35.700 --> 23:37.490
Go ahead and have a seat, Cody.

23:37.490 --> 23:40.300
Winner.

23:40.300 --> 23:43.180
Looks like it's down to
Ramses, Christmas, and Jessica.

23:50.010 --> 23:52.410
It's been a really
long night, and I'm

23:52.410 --> 23:55.140
trying to boost
myself up to stay up

23:55.140 --> 23:57.490
here for as long as possible.

23:57.490 --> 23:58.740
I am shaking.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.610
I have to focus
and win this HOH.

24:08.690 --> 24:11.030
Ramses has been eliminated.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.310
We started off
this HOH competition

24:17.310 --> 24:19.190
with odds in our favor--

24:19.190 --> 24:20.670
10 against 2.

24:20.670 --> 24:22.900
And now it's down to
Jess and Christmas?

24:22.900 --> 24:24.360
How did we get here?

24:37.450 --> 24:39.120
It all comes down to this.

24:39.120 --> 24:45.340
Christmas and Jessica, who will
be the next Head of Household?

24:45.340 --> 24:46.040
Hi, Ramses.

24:46.040 --> 24:49.700
Who would you like to
give your punishment to?

24:49.700 --> 24:52.180
Sorry, Jess.

24:52.180 --> 24:53.060
Uh-oh.

24:53.060 --> 24:54.360
The hot dog is back.

24:54.360 --> 24:58.860
And trust me, there's nothing
scarier that an angry wiener.

24:58.860 --> 25:01.170
You can throw all the
punishments you have my way,

25:01.170 --> 25:03.750
because I am so focused that
there is nothing that is going

25:03.750 --> 25:05.160
to cause me to drop this disc.

25:16.710 --> 25:19.630
Yeah, guys.
Good job.

25:19.630 --> 25:21.550
All of my housemates are gone.

25:21.550 --> 25:22.930
I'm standing on one foot.

25:22.930 --> 25:25.180
I am in such pain.

25:25.180 --> 25:26.980
Lock it in, Christmas Joy.

25:26.980 --> 25:27.910
You never crack, baby.

25:27.910 --> 25:28.660
You got it.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.940
But I am the HouseGuests'
last hope to make sure

25:30.940 --> 25:32.380
that Jessica doesn't get HOH.

26:02.330 --> 26:03.810
Congratulations, Jessica.

26:03.810 --> 26:06.280
You are the new
Head of Household.

26:11.770 --> 26:13.950
I am so happy that I won HOH.

26:13.950 --> 26:16.530
This is an absolute
game-changer for Cody and I.

26:16.530 --> 26:18.550
It guarantees us
another week of safety,

26:18.550 --> 26:21.100
and I don't have to
use the hex this week.

26:21.100 --> 26:23.030
You OK?

26:23.030 --> 26:26.490
I am more happy with Jessica's
win than any of my wins.

26:26.490 --> 26:27.610
The girl is incredible.

26:27.610 --> 26:31.160
The fact that she got the HOH
after I won the Battle Back

26:31.160 --> 26:33.190
is just a nail in the
coffin to everyone

26:33.190 --> 26:35.040
that turned their backs
on us in this game.

26:38.310 --> 26:39.260
Oh my god.

26:39.260 --> 26:40.670
Oh my god.
- I'm sorry.

26:40.670 --> 26:41.850
I'm totally not
hugging all of you.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.320
You are something else.

26:43.320 --> 26:44.840
The whole reason I
got into "Big Brother"

26:44.840 --> 26:48.170
and became such a fan of it,
is because my dad got me hooked

26:48.170 --> 26:49.610
and we used to
watch it together.

26:49.610 --> 26:51.980
My dad passed away
three years ago today,

26:51.980 --> 26:53.900
and life hasn't been
the same without him.

26:53.900 --> 26:56.630
So, winning this compe--

26:56.630 --> 26:58.580
competition, today
of all days, is

26:58.580 --> 27:01.610
just something really special,
and I'll never forget it.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.440
Good job.

27:06.440 --> 27:09.500
Not only did I
not get the HOH,

27:09.500 --> 27:15.350
I definitely feel responsible
for whoever goes home.

27:15.350 --> 27:18.720
I just really had something
major to prove to myself.

27:22.070 --> 27:24.530
And I'm upset that I fell short.

27:28.940 --> 27:30.630
Sorry.

27:30.630 --> 27:32.140
Way to go.

27:32.140 --> 27:35.110
This probably means that
I'm going on the block.

27:35.110 --> 27:37.360
But I just hope that
they put somebody that's

27:37.360 --> 27:39.520
a bigger target next to me.

27:39.520 --> 27:41.440
Congratulations.

27:41.440 --> 27:44.170
How did we mess this up?

27:44.170 --> 27:46.810
All I wanted was
to just sit back,

27:46.810 --> 27:50.150
relax, enjoy my
time in this house.

27:50.150 --> 27:53.710
And now I gotta do a whole
lot of work to protect my ass,

27:53.710 --> 27:56.750
because I'm pretty sure
I'm going up this week.

28:01.050 --> 28:01.750
Right.

28:04.710 --> 28:08.740
I just want to
jump in the shower.

28:08.740 --> 28:09.920
Towel?

28:09.920 --> 28:14.480
I received the hex temptation,
I survived an eviction,

28:14.480 --> 28:16.580
my boyfriend is
back in the house,

28:16.580 --> 28:18.750
and I'm Head of Household.

28:18.750 --> 28:22.100
Did all of my dreams
just come true this week?

28:22.100 --> 28:24.570
It's 6 o'clock?

28:24.570 --> 28:26.170
Oh my god.

28:26.170 --> 28:28.040
Now that I have
all of the power,

28:28.040 --> 28:30.250
everyone should be concerned.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.400
Respect.

28:32.160 --> 28:33.440
That's insanity.

28:33.440 --> 28:36.590
Jessica wins, so I'm an
obvious target this week

28:36.590 --> 28:38.210
because I sent Cody home.

28:38.210 --> 28:39.570
All circuits go.

28:39.570 --> 28:41.750
Push every panic button.

28:41.750 --> 28:43.200
Pissed.
Friendship.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.030
Push them all,
because I'm screwed.

28:50.770 --> 28:51.470
All right.

28:51.470 --> 28:53.510
I'm going to have to
say, Josh is just making

28:53.510 --> 28:56.000
a fool of himself, honestly.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.070
I think Josh is just immature.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.480
I think it's just his age.

28:59.480 --> 29:00.980
He's a good kid deep down.

29:00.980 --> 29:03.830
He just doesn't know how to
control himself at times.

29:03.830 --> 29:06.410
You know who they're
putting up, right?

29:06.410 --> 29:10.340
Josh and Josh.

29:10.340 --> 29:12.260
Twice.
- Yeah.

29:15.080 --> 29:18.960
I mean, everything hurt, but
otherwise I started shivering.

29:18.960 --> 29:21.490
I want you to know
that I meant what I said.

29:21.490 --> 29:22.530
I appreciate it.

29:22.530 --> 29:23.790
I really appreciate it.

29:23.790 --> 29:27.240
When Cody was HOH, he
blindsided a lot of people

29:27.240 --> 29:29.200
and lost a lot of
trust in the house.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.830
If Cody and I want to last
in this game long term,

29:31.830 --> 29:33.610
I have to do the exact opposite.

29:33.610 --> 29:37.160
So I plan on honoring the deal
that I made with Christmas.

29:37.160 --> 29:38.720
I saved you this time.

29:40.590 --> 29:43.680
My mom is going to scream.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.140
The first time around,
I just took big risks.

29:46.140 --> 29:48.690
Jessica played my
game, and I put

29:48.690 --> 29:50.940
her through a world of hell.

29:50.940 --> 29:54.540
So now this week, I am
doing exactly what she says.

29:54.540 --> 29:56.430
Just shut up and listen to Jess.

30:04.590 --> 30:06.820
Hey.

30:06.820 --> 30:11.740
Just remember, POV.

30:11.740 --> 30:12.780
One step at a time.

30:15.860 --> 30:19.360
That was some good--
talkin' though.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.690
Now that Jess is HOH,
I'm 100% sure that your boy

30:22.690 --> 30:24.200
is going on the block.

30:24.200 --> 30:27.620
But just know that I still
got a few tricks up my sleeve.

30:40.010 --> 30:43.320
I know that I'm going up
this week, no doubt about it.

30:43.320 --> 30:45.710
So the only way that I
can get out of this one

30:45.710 --> 30:48.500
is to convince Jess to
put up a bigger target.

30:51.990 --> 30:53.300
Can you give me a
couple of minutes?

30:53.300 --> 30:54.440
OK.
I'm sorry.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.300
I'll just sit out here and wait.
- OK.

30:56.300 --> 30:59.660
- Thank you.
- Please don't.

31:15.800 --> 31:16.920
He's waiting out there.

31:20.070 --> 31:22.110
What the-- does he
want to talk about?

31:22.110 --> 31:25.060
Like, you did all your talking
during the comp yesterday.

31:25.060 --> 31:26.130
Want me to send him away?

31:31.040 --> 31:32.390
Oh, god.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.090
I'm scared.

31:36.090 --> 31:37.990
She doesn't have time for you.

31:37.990 --> 31:39.230
She doesn't want to talk.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.650
No.

31:40.650 --> 31:41.860
Neither one of us want to talk.

31:41.860 --> 31:42.560
OK.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.100
It's obvious that
Private Meatball

31:47.100 --> 31:49.110
and his commanding officer
don't want to talk.

31:49.110 --> 31:50.700
Which means that I'm
going on the block.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.380
So I just hope that
there's somebody that's

31:52.380 --> 31:53.730
a bigger target next to me.

32:02.570 --> 32:03.950
We've come to talk.

32:03.950 --> 32:06.350
I can't trust Jessica or Cody.

32:06.350 --> 32:09.820
But at this moment, I'm going
to tell them exactly what they

32:09.820 --> 32:12.730
want to hear and appease
their little minds

32:12.730 --> 32:14.830
and think that I'm
OK and the Southern

32:14.830 --> 32:20.060
belle is on their side,
when all actuality, I'm not.

32:20.060 --> 32:21.040
What are you thinking?

32:25.200 --> 32:26.430
Cody's obviously back.

32:26.430 --> 32:27.270
Yep.

32:27.270 --> 32:30.240
I feel like I've
done kind of everything

32:30.240 --> 32:33.690
that I possibly could to
repair relationships that were

32:33.690 --> 32:35.610
damaged in the last few weeks.

32:35.610 --> 32:36.350
Yep.

32:36.350 --> 32:40.440
And I meant that in
a very genuine way.

32:40.440 --> 32:42.390
And even though I'm
HOH, I would like

32:42.390 --> 32:45.420
to prove that it wasn't
from a position of weakness

32:45.420 --> 32:47.640
and that I was actually
being genuine and not

32:47.640 --> 32:49.530
coming after anyone.

32:49.530 --> 32:50.830
I feel like you
were genuine when you

32:50.830 --> 32:52.610
had a talk with Elena and I.

32:52.610 --> 32:55.380
I kind of don't want to
hit that rock bottom again.

32:55.380 --> 32:57.330
Even though I'm
HOH, I'm definitely

32:57.330 --> 32:59.150
doing some butt-kissing myself.

32:59.150 --> 33:01.860
And that's just to set up
Cody and I for next week.

33:01.860 --> 33:04.290
I really don't want us to
be the target next week

33:04.290 --> 33:06.360
so I can save the hex for later.

33:06.360 --> 33:07.990
I haven't stopped
anybody in the back here.

33:07.990 --> 33:08.690
Right.

33:08.690 --> 33:10.050
And I want to
know moving forward

33:10.050 --> 33:12.990
that I have your support.

33:12.990 --> 33:14.730
- We support you.
- Yeah.

33:21.320 --> 33:22.840
After the week
you went through,

33:22.840 --> 33:23.980
I cannot be happier for you.

33:23.980 --> 33:25.310
Thank you.

33:25.310 --> 33:26.800
Anything I can do
in my power to make

33:26.800 --> 33:31.630
sure that the original
plan sticks, I'm all in.

33:31.630 --> 33:33.020
Because I do love you guys.

33:33.020 --> 33:33.820
I love you too.

33:36.100 --> 33:37.790
We do.

33:37.790 --> 33:38.930
Yeah.

33:38.930 --> 33:41.180
Every bromance
has a fight, guys.

33:41.180 --> 33:43.210
Technically, me and Mark kind
of started this all together.

33:43.210 --> 33:44.030
We really did.

33:44.030 --> 33:46.150
Cody completely
tarnished any game

33:46.150 --> 33:47.650
relationship I had with him.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.600
But I don't want to be
on the block this week

33:49.600 --> 33:52.440
either, so I'm absolutely
going to play nice right now.

33:52.440 --> 33:55.420
Mark, I promise
you, I hold no grudge.

33:55.420 --> 33:57.460
I probably trust Mark
the least in this game,

33:57.460 --> 34:00.460
because he is the one that
actually tried to say,

34:00.460 --> 34:03.200
we were ride or die to the
end, and then he stabbed

34:03.200 --> 34:04.900
me in the back, no problem.

34:04.900 --> 34:07.630
No matter what Mark says to me
now, I will never trust him.

34:07.630 --> 34:08.880
I love you two, bro.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.670
And it's--

34:10.670 --> 34:12.970
I love you, man.

34:17.200 --> 34:18.650
Just kidding.
You guys are adorable.

34:18.650 --> 34:19.550
I love you.

34:19.550 --> 34:21.470
Even though everyone
is acting like we're

34:21.470 --> 34:24.140
all a big happy
family all over again,

34:24.140 --> 34:26.120
I know it's only because
I'm Head of Household.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.850
Cody and I have been
betrayed before,

34:27.850 --> 34:30.170
and we're not making
that same mistake again.

34:30.170 --> 34:31.820
And can I just say,
even though you're

34:31.820 --> 34:36.970
HOH, how nice this feels, just
like week one, when we were

34:36.970 --> 34:38.950
up here having the same, like--

34:38.950 --> 34:39.720
Yep.

34:39.720 --> 34:40.910
--this interaction.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.840
What do you think
about Elena and Mark?

34:50.840 --> 34:55.050
Mark is playing a really
weird game, really bizarre.

34:55.050 --> 34:57.450
I really like Mark
as a person, but I

34:57.450 --> 34:59.260
don't trust anything he says.

34:59.260 --> 35:02.730
And he's already showed that,
like, when push comes to shove,

35:02.730 --> 35:05.090
he's going to go with
the safest route.

35:05.090 --> 35:08.160
And with us just being
the two lone wolves,

35:08.160 --> 35:09.810
there is no safe route with us.

35:09.810 --> 35:10.700
That's the thing.

35:10.700 --> 35:11.400
Yeah.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.500
It's not a
surprise that they're

35:13.500 --> 35:16.950
voting me out one week and then
kissing my butt the next week.

35:16.950 --> 35:18.780
They are just little pawns
throughout this game.

35:18.780 --> 35:20.930
So if I'm in a
position of power,

35:20.930 --> 35:22.140
of course they're
going to come up,

35:22.140 --> 35:23.220
and they're going to kiss up.

35:23.220 --> 35:24.810
I don't trust anybody
except for Jessica.

35:28.990 --> 35:30.820
You're doing good, real good.

35:33.470 --> 35:34.930
Well, look, dude.
Here's my thing.

35:34.930 --> 35:37.440
And I'm going to be
very forward with you.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.600
The only reason I came
after you is because you

35:39.600 --> 35:40.560
took that shot at me.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.230
And I genuinely had
no ulterior motives.

35:43.230 --> 35:45.210
I respected you
getting me out,

35:45.210 --> 35:47.240
because it's exactly
what you needed to do.

35:47.240 --> 35:48.100
And you--

35:48.100 --> 35:49.660
And now it's,
like, straight even.

35:49.660 --> 35:52.320
I gain nothing by taking
another shot at you,

35:52.320 --> 35:54.090
because I already made
the maverick move.

35:54.090 --> 35:55.580
You already made
the maverick move.

35:55.580 --> 35:57.970
It would just look petty
if I just ..

35:57.970 --> 35:59.440
The one person
who is going to play

35:59.440 --> 36:01.380
this game as straightforward
is the person

36:01.380 --> 36:02.130
who's done it before.

36:02.130 --> 36:04.070
I mean, you keep your word.

36:04.070 --> 36:06.470
Now that me and you
are even, I mean,

36:06.470 --> 36:08.160
it's legit a new game now.

36:08.160 --> 36:10.170
If you want to duke
it out, then we're

36:10.170 --> 36:11.790
going to have to duke it out.

36:11.790 --> 36:13.710
If you want to not
duke it out, continue

36:13.710 --> 36:17.070
just tossing pins down,
then that's what we'll do.

36:17.070 --> 36:19.260
The craziest thing is,
if we worked together,

36:19.260 --> 36:21.410
we could go extremely far.
- Absolutely.

36:21.410 --> 36:22.710
And you recognize that, right?

36:22.710 --> 36:23.790
I do recognize that.

36:23.790 --> 36:25.680
I'm sure me and Paul could
run the show all the way

36:25.680 --> 36:27.060
to the end, but I
don't really trust

36:27.060 --> 36:28.410
anything he's saying anyway.

36:28.410 --> 36:31.050
I'm going to pretend
fences have been mended,

36:31.050 --> 36:33.210
but it's all a show.

36:33.210 --> 36:35.580
I highly suggest you assess
what all these people

36:35.580 --> 36:37.300
are going to start.

36:37.300 --> 36:39.510
Cody, I wouldn't want to
work with you if you were

36:39.510 --> 36:41.220
the last person on this
planet, because you

36:41.220 --> 36:42.900
tried to backdoor me week one.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.760
Fool me once, shame on you.

36:45.760 --> 36:48.330
Fool me twice, shame on me.

36:48.330 --> 36:50.940
I promise you, I am
emotionally disconnected

36:50.940 --> 36:53.700
from so many of these
people that, you know,

36:53.700 --> 36:55.740
like, I thought had
loyalty towards me.

36:55.740 --> 36:57.970
Now I'm willing to play
the game against them.

37:06.900 --> 37:09.840
Where'd did you
get this nice duvet?

37:09.840 --> 37:11.280
Don't worry about that.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.210
It's called a puff.

37:13.210 --> 37:14.400
It's called a duvet.

37:17.940 --> 37:19.980
Kevin, I don't believe you.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.500
I did not see that.

37:25.500 --> 37:26.720
You're a dirty liar.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.540
- No way.

37:31.460 --> 37:32.900
Explain to me the science.

37:32.900 --> 37:33.690
I don't have none.

37:33.690 --> 37:36.170
I sweat at night,
and it takes it off.

37:36.170 --> 37:37.730
Inches off when you sleep.

37:37.730 --> 37:39.540
What?

37:39.540 --> 37:42.780
Kevin starts telling me about
his secret weight training

37:42.780 --> 37:43.610
tips.

37:43.610 --> 37:46.400
I feel like I'm watching
a cheesy infomercial.

37:46.400 --> 37:50.360
But instead, I'm watching Kevin
wrap himself up like leftover

37:50.360 --> 37:51.890
food going in a fridge.

37:51.890 --> 37:54.120
You're not a piece of steak.

37:54.120 --> 37:56.840
Look, Kev, we're
not in 1956 anymore.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.190
You could go to a gym.

37:58.190 --> 38:00.040
You could run outside.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.410
What, you don't
think it's a good idea?

38:01.410 --> 38:02.890
Come on.
I know you're joking.

38:02.890 --> 38:04.330
- Kevin--
- It's good for you.

38:04.330 --> 38:05.540
No, it's not.

38:05.540 --> 38:07.370
You're mushing your
organs together.

38:07.370 --> 38:08.880
I know.
It hurts sometimes.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.400
But-- so, look--

38:10.400 --> 38:11.100
Kevin, you're 54.

38:11.100 --> 38:12.850
You can't afford
to lose a kidney.

38:12.850 --> 38:13.550
sleep.

38:16.100 --> 38:17.000
No!

38:17.000 --> 38:17.900
Of course.

38:17.900 --> 38:20.670
The cling wrap was an
old trick from back East.

38:20.670 --> 38:21.370
No!

38:24.470 --> 38:26.550
You wrap in plastic
at night, you go to bed,

38:26.550 --> 38:28.040
you get up the
next morning, man,

38:28.040 --> 38:30.200
you're in shape without
doing a sit-up, a push-up,

38:30.200 --> 38:30.980
and that's the routine.

38:30.980 --> 38:32.870
Do that, and you
will lose weight.

38:32.870 --> 38:34.190
Cling wrap at night.

38:34.190 --> 38:35.120
It will keep you tight.

38:37.060 --> 38:37.760
And?

38:50.410 --> 38:52.030
I don't know what to do.

38:55.510 --> 38:59.950
Come talk to me in here,
because I need to put on makeup.

38:59.950 --> 39:02.200
Nominations are
coming up fast, and I

39:02.200 --> 39:04.360
have a big decision to make.

39:04.360 --> 39:07.750
The goal this week is to plan
for the longevity of Cody

39:07.750 --> 39:08.840
and I's game.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.590
Josh is the obvious choice.

39:11.590 --> 39:16.080
You could do the
Josh Ramses thing.

39:16.080 --> 39:20.100
Ramses doesn't really have
many people left in this house.

39:20.100 --> 39:23.220
He's not really a threat
to my game or Jess's game.

39:23.220 --> 39:25.590
So as far as being
a pawn for us,

39:25.590 --> 39:28.860
it's pretty much
an ideal choice.

39:28.860 --> 39:34.060
My problem with that move
is if we decide to take out

39:34.060 --> 39:39.930
a bigger target who was to
veto, Josh or Ramses being up

39:39.930 --> 39:43.030
next to them
doesn't make me feel

39:43.030 --> 39:45.390
comfortable that the bigger
target would go home.

39:45.390 --> 39:47.880
I know what I want to do.

39:47.880 --> 39:48.980
I want to cut off the head.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.240
But the safe move is
to cut off the ass.

39:56.770 --> 39:57.500
Agree.

39:57.500 --> 40:00.540
We need numbers on the
other side of the house.

40:00.540 --> 40:02.720
Taking a shot at
Paul is really risky.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.710
We are still a
minority in the house.

40:04.710 --> 40:06.070
We don't have numbers.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.460
So we have to be careful
how we move forward.

40:08.460 --> 40:10.830
If I make such a big move
and it doesn't work out,

40:10.830 --> 40:12.780
we're going to have a serious
problem down the road.

40:12.780 --> 40:15.150
But, like, the conversation I
had with Paul was pretty much,

40:15.150 --> 40:17.500
I don't believe what he
said in that conversation.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.060
Paul is vulnerable right now.

40:19.060 --> 40:21.350
His medallion has
ran out, and it would

40:21.350 --> 40:23.490
take nothing to back door him.
- Yeah.

40:23.490 --> 40:25.230
Literally nothing.

40:25.230 --> 40:27.390
Nobody wants to
waste their HOH.

40:27.390 --> 40:30.060
Whatever move you make,
I'm not going to complain.

40:30.060 --> 40:32.730
I hate gambling.

40:32.730 --> 40:34.170
I mean, I dig it.

40:34.170 --> 40:38.280
Plus I think you're a bad
ass, so I kind of want

40:38.280 --> 40:40.090
to see you make bad-ass moves.

40:40.090 --> 40:41.910
And that way, if it
blows up in your face,

40:41.910 --> 40:44.030
I can go, hey, see how it is?

40:44.030 --> 40:45.020
See how it is?

41:09.910 --> 41:12.120
This is the nomination ceremony.

41:12.120 --> 41:14.030
It is my responsibility
as Head of Household

41:14.030 --> 41:17.610
to nominate two
HouseGuests for eviction.

41:17.610 --> 41:20.000
In my nomination block are
the keys of the HouseGuests

41:20.000 --> 41:21.440
I am nominating for eviction.

41:24.020 --> 41:26.780
I will turn two keys to
lock in my nominations,

41:26.780 --> 41:30.650
and their faces will
appear on the memory wall.

41:30.650 --> 41:32.630
The first HouseGuest
I have nominated is--

41:42.080 --> 41:44.060
The next HouseGuest
I have nominated is--

41:58.300 --> 42:01.880
I have nominated you,
Ramses, and you, Josh.

42:01.880 --> 42:04.100
Ramses, please don't
take it personal.

42:04.100 --> 42:05.330
You're not my target this week.

42:05.330 --> 42:07.820
You're just a pawn.

42:07.820 --> 42:11.370
Josh, I think you have played a
very dirty and disgusting game

42:11.370 --> 42:12.410
in this house.

42:12.410 --> 42:14.930
And in my opinion, you don't
even deserve to be here.

42:14.930 --> 42:18.910
And I can't imagine someone
better to take you out than me.

42:18.910 --> 42:21.180
This nomination
ceremony is adjourned.

42:26.980 --> 42:30.280
I put Josh on the block because
just the sound of his name

42:30.280 --> 42:31.360
makes me cringe.

42:31.360 --> 42:33.320
And him leaving
this week wouldn't

42:33.320 --> 42:35.350
make too many people upset.

42:35.350 --> 42:37.960
On the other hand, we
haven't played POV yet,

42:37.960 --> 42:40.390
and there are still some really
big targets in this house

42:40.390 --> 42:42.630
that I wouldn't
mind seeing leaving.

42:42.630 --> 42:45.230
So right now I'm on
the block as a pawn.

42:45.230 --> 42:46.590
But I'm freaking alone.

42:46.590 --> 42:49.700
And there's no one in this
house that I can guarantee will

42:49.700 --> 42:51.820
give me their votes to stay.

42:51.820 --> 42:55.740
I'm going to do anything I can
so that I can win this veto.

42:55.740 --> 42:59.810
It's like I just waited
for a bomb to explode.

42:59.810 --> 43:02.030
Only I didn't get hit.

43:02.030 --> 43:05.200
Even though I wasn't nominated
and Josh is the clear target,

43:05.200 --> 43:07.130
I'm not out of the water yet.

43:07.130 --> 43:11.210
So I gotta start stirring
things up to protect my back.

43:11.210 --> 43:13.270
It just completely sucks.

43:13.270 --> 43:14.750
It's not about
being on the block.

43:14.750 --> 43:17.810
It's about the message that
she said-- like, saying that I

43:17.810 --> 43:19.160
don't deserve to be here.

43:19.160 --> 43:19.860
Like--

43:21.500 --> 43:23.230
I do deserve to be here.

43:23.230 --> 43:25.100
Yeah, it's been crazy
and it's been tough.

43:25.100 --> 43:26.810
But I love every single
minute in this house.

43:26.810 --> 43:29.320
I love waking up in this
house, and I'm not ready to go.

43:29.320 --> 43:30.760
I'm gonna win that veto.

43:30.760 --> 43:32.330
I'm not going down
without a fight.

43:37.070 --> 43:39.530
ANNOUNCER: Who will
win the power of veto?

43:39.530 --> 43:41.990
And will it be used
to save either Ramses

43:41.990 --> 43:44.280
or Josh from eviction?

43:44.280 --> 43:50.270
