00:59.852 --> 01:02.438
<i>Today marks a bleak anniversary
for our planet.</i>

01:02.605 --> 01:05.858
<i>Three years ago the first case
of a global plant virus was reported,</i>

01:06.783 --> 01:09.487
<i>which started to ravage
most of our ecosystems.</i>

01:10.070 --> 01:12.061
<i>The world's leading research laboratories</i>

01:12.161 --> 01:15.204
<i>have been trying to find a way
to stop this deadly pathogen,</i>

01:15.304 --> 01:17.703
<i>but so far their efforts
have been unsuccessful.</i>

01:17.870 --> 01:21.752
<i>The latest research shows that people
who consume food infected with a virus</i>

01:21.852 --> 01:24.251
<i>develop severe autoimmune diseases.</i>

01:24.418 --> 01:27.797
<i>In addition, the loss of plant life
has contributed to the concentration</i>

01:27.963 --> 01:31.425
<i>of oxygen in the atmosphere
to decrease to 18%.</i>

01:31.592 --> 01:33.302
<i>The lowest on record.</i>

01:33.469 --> 01:36.305
<i>The rapidly disappearing forest
cannot recycle</i>

01:36.472 --> 01:40.226
<i>enough carbon dioxide to maintain
these level for much longer.</i>

01:41.060 --> 01:44.045
<i>These atmospheric changes
have caused an increase</i>

01:44.145 --> 01:46.440
<i>in natural disasters around the globe.</i>

01:46.565 --> 01:49.360
<i>As oxygen levels drop below 10%,</i>

01:49.527 --> 01:51.362
<i>people will begin to suffocate.</i>

01:51.529 --> 01:53.989
<i>Our beautiful planet Earth is doomed.</i>

01:54.156 --> 01:56.700
<i>But humanity still has
a chance of survival.</i>

01:56.867 --> 01:58.953
<i>And their best hope is Project Gemini</i>

01:59.119 --> 02:01.121
<i>developed by Dr. Steven Ross.</i>

02:01.288 --> 02:03.616
<i>The project centers around
an archaeological find</i>

02:03.716 --> 02:06.705
<i>discovered eight years ago
by a group of paleontologists</i>

02:06.808 --> 02:10.005
<i>who found two unique objects
of extraterrestrial origin.</i>

02:10.381 --> 02:14.260
<i>The artifacts were estimated
to be more than four billion years old.</i>

02:15.594 --> 02:17.555
Stephen Hawking once said,

02:18.472 --> 02:21.183
that if humans are to survive long term,

02:22.309 --> 02:24.144
we must find a way
to get off planet Earth.

02:24.937 --> 02:27.189
He was optimistic
about our chances,

02:27.356 --> 02:30.609
and in fact, as it turns out he was right.

02:31.277 --> 02:35.865
These unique devices that we found
appeared on Earth before life itself.

02:37.533 --> 02:41.579
We don't know what mysterious Stellar
wisdom created them and left them here,

02:41.745 --> 02:45.624
but we've received this gift
on the brink of extinction.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.879
We managed to recreate
this pseudo tough materials**

02:50.254 --> 02:52.965
that the Sphere and the Engine
are made of.

02:53.591 --> 02:56.468
And we precisely copied
both of the devices.

02:57.386 --> 03:01.849
Now each of them has an identical twin.

03:02.641 --> 03:05.769
The Warp Engine
for interstellar flights

03:05.936 --> 03:07.813
has allowed us to find a planet

03:08.314 --> 03:11.108
more or less suitable for terraforming.

03:12.067 --> 03:16.655
The unmanned vehicle completed a jump
to the solar system TESS

03:17.239 --> 03:21.076
and returned with information
and samples that confirmed our theories.

03:23.412 --> 03:27.207
And this device, this Sphere,
is for creating life.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.627
After years of research,

03:29.793 --> 03:33.172
we discovered a way
to control the Sphere and the Engine.

03:33.297 --> 03:37.009
These devices have their own
unique language.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.304
We decoded dozens of commands,

03:40.429 --> 03:43.432
each of which corresponds
to a certain pattern.

03:43.599 --> 03:46.769
This pattern gave
the initial command,

03:47.102 --> 03:51.389
and the Sphere began to carry out
more than four billion years now.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.249
The Sphere uses chemical elements
from the environment

04:09.583 --> 04:11.669
and creates a true miracle:

04:12.795 --> 04:13.754
life!

04:14.630 --> 04:18.216
Now we know life on Earth
was created by this machine.

04:19.051 --> 04:22.346
The Sphere is our starting point.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.685
Let me introduce you to our team
of leading research scientists.

04:31.021 --> 04:34.942
Our team consists of:
Dr. Peter Lehmann,

04:35.109 --> 04:38.028
a specialist in extraterrestrial
Warp Engine.

04:39.071 --> 04:40.656
Doctor Leona Redwood,

04:40.823 --> 04:43.117
a terraforming program builder.

04:44.910 --> 04:48.414
Today we are joined
by military trained pilots,

04:48.580 --> 04:50.541
headed by Major Ryan Connor.

04:53.127 --> 04:56.005
We are departing
for the solar system TESS,

04:56.505 --> 04:59.258
several hundred
light years from here.

04:59.425 --> 05:03.303
We will bring The Sphere to a planet

05:03.637 --> 05:05.973
that has the right conditions.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.434
And we'll create

05:09.018 --> 05:10.894
Earth 2.0,

05:11.645 --> 05:13.731
a new home for humanity.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.724
What do you think, Peter?

08:37.017 --> 08:39.311
Whoever created this, where are they now?

08:40.395 --> 08:42.105
There's not enough data to say.

08:42.813 --> 08:46.151
And I don't really like speculating
about stuff like this.

08:46.318 --> 08:49.279
This isn't about the speculation.
It's a theory.

08:51.073 --> 08:53.492
Maybe it was
a lost civilization.

08:54.159 --> 08:57.120
We know from experience
how highly-developed civilizations

08:57.329 --> 08:59.831
are good at self-destruction.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.417
-Who knows?
-Yeah.

09:28.318 --> 09:32.030
Well, another giant leap
for humanity, eh, guys?

09:33.615 --> 09:37.577
Only this time literally,
for the first time in history.

09:37.953 --> 09:40.111
Just as long as something
more than a bunch of atoms

09:40.211 --> 09:42.057
makes it to the destination…

09:42.457 --> 09:43.667
It still counts.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.004
Say it. For the first time in history.

09:51.049 --> 09:54.636
Attention! And prepare for a jump.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.546
All systems are ready.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.382
The coordinates are set.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.760
Warp Drive set at maximum power.

10:34.926 --> 10:35.969
Ready?

10:39.639 --> 10:40.474
Engage.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.224
<i>Critical error.</i>

11:24.393 --> 11:25.394
<i>Critical error.</i>

11:27.813 --> 11:29.022
<i>Critical error.</i>

11:31.191 --> 11:32.234
<i>Critical error.</i>

12:50.562 --> 12:51.855
Where are we?

12:59.863 --> 13:01.239
Is this TESS?

13:06.995 --> 13:08.997
Richard, did we complete the maneuver?

13:10.123 --> 13:10.957
Yes, we did.

13:11.374 --> 13:14.461
Star maps…
They don't match up.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.380
It's not TESS.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.597
What coordinates
did you put in?

13:26.973 --> 13:29.017
Are you sure they were operational?

13:30.393 --> 13:31.686
Of course, sir.

13:32.354 --> 13:33.647
Did you check the Engine?

13:34.564 --> 13:36.733
Everything was done according to protocol.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.611
If everything was done to protocol,

13:39.778 --> 13:41.488
we'd be in TESS right now.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.282
The mission failed, Peter.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.326
There is no hope for Earth now.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.705
-Permission to check the Engine.
-No.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.624
You are relieved of your duties.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.460
Stay in your bunk until I say otherwise.

14:03.468 --> 14:04.553
Yes, sir.

15:08.366 --> 15:09.784
What's this?

15:10.994 --> 15:14.497
In physics,
there is an equation…

15:15.373 --> 15:16.916
The Dirac equation.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.962
When two particles
come into contact,

15:21.796 --> 15:23.882
they become bound forever.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.344
They continue to "feel" one another,

15:27.510 --> 15:30.764
even if they are light years apart.

15:32.015 --> 15:34.559
It's called quantum entanglement.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.605
That's physics for you?

15:41.483 --> 15:43.026
Not just physics.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.772
Try de-set the jump trajectory.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.775
Maybe it will help us
figure out where we are.

16:23.942 --> 16:27.195
No, Steve.
The trajectory is not clear.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.532
The data doesn't make any sense at all.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.909
We've entered the fourth dimension,

16:33.076 --> 16:36.496
But it's almost as if we moved along
the coordinates axis that we can't access.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.916
And then we jumped back
into three-dimensional space.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.712
But where?

16:59.769 --> 17:04.065
Is there anything around us
that can help us figure out our location?

17:04.232 --> 17:08.486
No, no land marks.
Nothing even remotely familiar.

17:09.404 --> 17:12.949
We have no point to set a return jump.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.367
So that means

17:15.952 --> 17:18.621
that until we figure out
where we are we can't get back.

17:18.788 --> 17:19.998
No.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.877
<i>Repair airlock is open.</i>

17:24.042 --> 17:25.240
What's that?

17:25.430 --> 17:27.670
The repair airlock
of the Engine compartment is open.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.635
Why? And who is there?

17:35.430 --> 17:38.850
Repair airlock, this is
the captain calling. Airlock, report.

17:39.017 --> 17:41.519
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

17:45.231 --> 17:47.317
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

17:51.404 --> 17:53.281
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

17:57.410 --> 17:59.287
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

18:02.916 --> 18:04.834
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

18:20.350 --> 18:21.643
Shit!

18:44.874 --> 18:46.584
I can't believe it.

18:46.709 --> 18:47.585
Calm down, Leona.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.214
We gotta keep our cool
if we wanna survive.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.259
We are already a man down.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.848
Peter ignored Steve's orders,
went to the Engine compartment,

19:00.849 --> 19:04.727
realised what he'd done,
and that was the end.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.523
Peter wouldn't have.

19:10.775 --> 19:11.818
I knew him.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.904
I worked with him for eight years.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.574
He couldn't given up so easily.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.158
Leona, enough.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.161
How can you defend him?

19:23.538 --> 19:26.291
Now we have to deal
with the results of his mistakes.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.418
Do his work for him.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.964
One person put multiple lives in danger.

19:34.424 --> 19:37.552
He almost destroyed
humanity's only chance of survival.

19:37.719 --> 19:40.054
That's who you should be crying for?

20:14.255 --> 20:17.008
After Rita died
I didn't wanna live anymore.

20:18.843 --> 20:21.721
But then I thought,
instead of ending it all

20:21.888 --> 20:24.307
I could make it mean something.

20:27.018 --> 20:29.520
So I decided
to devote myself to the mission.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.232
But now it turns out

20:34.984 --> 20:39.197
that I'm less useful
here than on Earth.

20:44.661 --> 20:45.828
David…

20:47.622 --> 20:50.917
Everything will be all right.
We'll find a way out this.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.963
The future of Earth
depends on our mission.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.173
Giving up is not an option.

21:01.552 --> 21:04.555
We need to establish
what part of the universe we're in.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.058
-Richard, do you have anything?
-Not yet.

21:07.767 --> 21:11.104
I'm tracking the moving trajectories
of the nearest stars and planets.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.732
I'll try to calculate
our position from there.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.236
David, what about that planet?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.406
Any data on the probe?

21:23.449 --> 21:24.701
Just loaded.

21:28.246 --> 21:29.372
Great.

21:29.872 --> 21:32.917
The surface of the planet
is made of volcanic rock.

21:34.168 --> 21:36.004
There is no biosphere.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.590
There is an atmosphere,
but without oxygen.

21:39.757 --> 21:42.552
The average temperature
is 16 degrees Celsius.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.015
The outside environment isn't aggressive.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.726
All we'll need are breathing masks.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.440
It's perfect.

21:57.025 --> 21:59.819
If I could choose
between TESS and this planet,

22:00.778 --> 22:02.113
I'd go here.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.706
Do you realize how lucky we are?

22:12.248 --> 22:16.169
What was the likelihood of winding up
near planet that's perfect for the Sphere?

22:16.544 --> 22:18.212
What if this isn't an accident?

22:18.379 --> 22:20.798
What if we were brought here on purpose?

22:22.800 --> 22:25.386
-By whom?
-The same thing that left us the Sphere.

22:26.012 --> 22:29.348
-Ryan, get ready to disembark.
-What do you mean?

22:29.515 --> 22:32.435
We can complete our mission
on this planet.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.771
But we haven't examined it.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.565
But this is our chance.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.718
If we launch the Sphere on this planet

22:39.818 --> 22:42.051
we'll have enough time
to understand where we are.

22:42.153 --> 22:44.697
Then, other ships come repeat our job.

22:46.449 --> 22:49.869
Richard, prepare the lander
to go down to the planet.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.580
But it's a young planet,
the atmosphere is unstable.

22:52.747 --> 22:54.082
We don't know anything about it.

22:54.248 --> 22:56.667
It might not be safe
to make a surface landing.

22:56.834 --> 23:00.046
I agree, you're recklessly risking
the safety of the crew.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.547
And I'm against it.

23:01.964 --> 23:05.093
Thankfully, I am the one
who makes the final decisions.

23:05.259 --> 23:08.346
No, Steve. It's too early
for decisions like these.

23:08.805 --> 23:11.265
I said we are landing.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.352
Richard, show in the landing area.

23:56.519 --> 23:58.312
You'll land here, in the valley.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.232
The weather conditions
for descent are optimal.

24:01.357 --> 24:03.734
We're ready.
Initiate un-docking procedure.

24:04.652 --> 24:06.821
<i>Un-docking sequence initiated.</i>

24:52.158 --> 24:53.743
<i>Engine's activated.</i>

24:54.076 --> 24:56.329
<i>The height is 30,000 meters. Coming down.</i>

25:12.762 --> 25:14.180
A storm front is heading your way.

25:14.639 --> 25:17.725
<i>It formed a few minutes ago.
Couldn't have predicted it.</i>

25:17.892 --> 25:20.144
<i>The winds are up to 40 meters per second.</i>

25:20.603 --> 25:24.106
So hold on.
Activating braking thrusters.

25:27.735 --> 25:29.028
What the hell was that?

25:29.195 --> 25:31.364
<i>- What's going on?</i>
-It's the wind.

25:31.822 --> 25:33.532
The storm is quite aggressive.

25:35.910 --> 25:39.580
The descent is twice as high
as the landing speed. We're falling.

25:40.248 --> 25:41.582
We're gonna crush into surface.

25:41.999 --> 25:44.502
I can double the thrust.
It will slow your fall.

25:45.044 --> 25:48.589
<i>If we use that we won't have a fuel
for the return flight!</i>

25:49.966 --> 25:52.593
If we don't, we will die!

25:52.760 --> 25:55.471
The temperature is too extreme.
Your hole is melting.

25:55.638 --> 25:57.807
Damn it!
Release the first tank.

26:09.652 --> 26:12.446
I'll try to slow you down aerodynamically.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.365
I hope the hole holds up.

26:26.877 --> 26:29.130
<i>Hold on.
We are coming in on it!</i>

26:29.297 --> 26:30.298
<i>Brace for impact!</i>

26:50.860 --> 26:51.944
Amy…

27:00.036 --> 27:02.747
Amy, why did you fly off to?

27:05.249 --> 27:06.667
I need you.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.428
I got you something.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.347
What's this?

27:20.556 --> 27:22.475
We've been together for a year.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.188
You know, The Sphere means a lot to me,

27:27.355 --> 27:29.231
but not as much as you do.

27:31.233 --> 27:34.153
Obviously, I know
you two don't get along.

27:34.487 --> 27:37.531
So I thought to create
something to connect you both.

27:37.698 --> 27:39.742
It's made out of the old Sphere.

27:41.202 --> 27:43.162
There was a fragment
that really stood out.

27:44.205 --> 27:46.499
It's so beautiful. Thank you.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.418
I thought it would be symbolic.

27:51.045 --> 27:53.547
The Sphere is our salvation,

27:54.006 --> 27:55.424
and you are mine.

28:01.472 --> 28:04.725
Let's go home. The sprinklers
are about to start spraying.

28:04.892 --> 28:07.520
Let's stay for a while.

28:59.697 --> 29:02.741
-What's the status on the lander?
<i>- No critical damage.</i>

29:04.410 --> 29:06.287
<i>But it's almost out of fuel.</i>

29:09.707 --> 29:12.793
Now we can't get back to the ship,
we're stuck here.

29:12.918 --> 29:17.298
Why go back to the ship?
Our plan was to come back in four years.

29:17.631 --> 29:20.509
And now our main task
is to install and launch the Sphere.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.261
We're continuing the program.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.054
But we can't carry it out now.

29:24.722 --> 29:28.142
We strayed too far away from
the landing site, into the mountains.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.979
That means there should be caves here.

29:33.022 --> 29:36.233
But it's impossible to deploy
domes on this terrain.

29:37.526 --> 29:40.529
We'll manage without domes.
A deep enough cave

29:40.696 --> 29:43.282
will provide the right amount
of protection for the Sphere.

29:43.908 --> 29:45.910
There! This cave looks suitable.

29:46.494 --> 29:48.746
It's big enough and easy to access.

29:48.913 --> 29:50.998
Leona, you get the data
on seismic activity,

29:51.165 --> 29:52.625
David, adjust the program.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.835
Everyone else, check the equipment.

29:56.253 --> 29:58.464
Get to work, people,
what are you waiting for?

31:42.359 --> 31:45.988
Conditions on this planet
are even better than we expected.

31:47.364 --> 31:49.283
Other ships will arrive here soon.

31:50.075 --> 31:53.245
A new history of mankind begins here,

31:53.412 --> 31:54.997
at this very minute.

33:53.449 --> 33:55.159
We did it! I can't believe it.

33:56.452 --> 34:00.080
Peter would be so happy.
He worked so hard for this.

34:00.247 --> 34:01.790
<i>Captain, you need to see this.</i>

34:01.957 --> 34:03.041
He should be here.

34:03.167 --> 34:05.461
Okay, attention, team.

34:06.086 --> 34:07.421
We're returning to base.

34:09.757 --> 34:10.757
Move out.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.806
David, do you have any data?

34:22.311 --> 34:23.395
Not yet.

34:27.608 --> 34:30.569
Doctor Ross, martial laws
are in effect on this station.

34:32.321 --> 34:34.156
What? Why?

34:34.572 --> 34:36.158
We have new information.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.367
Richard?

34:38.243 --> 34:39.620
Starting playback.

34:53.675 --> 34:55.092
<i>This is Dr. Peter Lehmann.</i>

34:56.094 --> 34:59.640
<i>Against all orders, I will personally
conduct an Engine inspection.</i>

35:00.349 --> 35:02.001
<i>I'm now recording all of my actions</i>

35:02.101 --> 35:04.447
<i>so I'm not accused of tampering
with the results.</i>

35:04.895 --> 35:08.607
<i>The security cameras are switched off
so that I am not interrupted.</i>

35:08.774 --> 35:10.943
<i>I'm not gonna be a scapegoat.</i>

35:11.860 --> 35:14.655
<i>I'm gonna prove that I made no mistake.</i>

36:00.242 --> 36:03.036
<i>Help!</i>

36:14.965 --> 36:16.258
What was that?

36:18.218 --> 36:20.596
Some kind of a life form?

36:21.555 --> 36:23.098
Was that what killed Peter?

36:23.849 --> 36:25.899
<i>I watched all of the recordings
from the cameras.</i>

36:26.034 --> 36:28.099
<i>It shows up by the Sphere
for the first time</i>

36:28.199 --> 36:29.996
<i>right after we left Earth.</i>

36:30.647 --> 36:32.608
This thing crawled out of the Sphere?

36:33.817 --> 36:36.278
Straight outta the story
of the Trojan horse.

36:38.113 --> 36:41.241
<i>And that Trojan climbed right into
the Engine just before the jump.</i>

36:42.492 --> 36:45.037
So maybe it caused the failure?

36:46.747 --> 36:50.709
Richard, if that Trojan
is still on the ship, you're in danger.

36:51.126 --> 36:53.837
No. He went down with you,

36:54.171 --> 36:55.505
<i>into the Sphere.</i>

36:56.256 --> 36:57.633
<i>We can track its position.</i>

36:57.799 --> 37:00.886
It causes interference
in the electromagnetic field.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.164
<i>Here's the video from the cameras
right before the landing.</i>

37:05.891 --> 37:08.518
I've got the first data from the cave.

37:09.436 --> 37:10.646
Something's strange. Steve?

37:16.485 --> 37:21.698
Levels of CO2 and oxidation
inside the Sphere are rising,

37:21.865 --> 37:24.910
but there aren't any bio markers.

37:25.077 --> 37:27.329
What? Could it be a malfunction?

37:27.496 --> 37:29.748
No, it's working in a full capacity.

37:29.873 --> 37:33.168
Just on the different program
than the one we've uploaded.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.879
It's doing something else.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.006
Regroup.

37:38.173 --> 37:41.259
We're going back to the Sphere.
We need to adjust the settings.

37:41.426 --> 37:42.803
Nobody's going anywhere, Steve.

37:44.137 --> 37:48.183
We'll adjust the settings later,
after we deal with the threat.

37:48.350 --> 37:51.853
But Steve is the head of the project,
he calls the shots.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.563
Not anymore.

37:54.731 --> 37:57.609
Now it's a question of the crew survival.

37:58.423 --> 38:00.404
Steve, I'm taking command,
you're being relieved.

38:02.155 --> 38:03.740
You can't do that.

38:03.907 --> 38:06.660
The future of mankind
depends on this mission.

38:06.827 --> 38:08.870
Only Dr. Ross can carry it out.

38:09.037 --> 38:12.290
Are you sure that Dr. Ross
is giving us all the information

38:12.457 --> 38:14.918
about what the Sphere actually is?

38:16.169 --> 38:17.629
What are you talking about?

38:18.255 --> 38:20.382
Richard, show the video from the cave.

38:31.435 --> 38:33.186
Steve saw the anomaly.

38:34.146 --> 38:36.648
And didn't say anything to anyone

38:36.815 --> 38:39.317
<i>risking the lives of the entire crew.</i>

38:42.029 --> 38:45.073
-Where did it come from?
-Right from the Sphere.

38:46.950 --> 38:50.328
Which as it turns out
we know too little about.

38:51.079 --> 38:53.707
What if it's an incubator
for those monsters?

38:54.499 --> 38:59.421
I didn't hide a single confirmed fact
about the Sphere from you.

39:00.797 --> 39:04.217
And there was no sense
in discussing anomalies.

39:04.593 --> 39:07.429
If we had known about these anomalies,

39:07.846 --> 39:10.557
we would have treated
the Sphere differently,

39:11.433 --> 39:13.727
and Peter would be alive right now.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.343
David, I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

39:48.637 --> 39:49.805
It's okay.

39:50.764 --> 39:52.682
I understand how busy you are.

39:53.058 --> 39:56.103
Yes, we don't have much time to spare.

39:56.520 --> 39:57.521
Why are you here?

39:58.980 --> 40:03.026
The doctor says I'm fine.
Gave me a clean bill of health.

40:03.568 --> 40:06.154
So I'm ready to join everyone
for the pre-launch.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.073
What?

40:09.241 --> 40:10.450
I mean you…

40:11.952 --> 40:14.162
You're actually planning to fly?

40:14.329 --> 40:17.874
But you are the one who made me
a member of the crew.

40:18.208 --> 40:19.543
But that was…

40:20.085 --> 40:21.461
before…

40:22.838 --> 40:24.256
Before Rita died?

40:24.422 --> 40:27.509
So what?
I'm telling you the psychologist

40:27.676 --> 40:29.511
has confirmed I'm okay.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.347
But to lose a daughter…

40:32.973 --> 40:35.183
David, I'm terribly sorry.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.728
I understand you want to get back to work

40:38.895 --> 40:41.106
but this is not the best way.

40:42.232 --> 40:44.609
Right now you need time to grief.

40:45.277 --> 40:47.696
Steve, I'm not flying
to forget my daughter.

40:47.863 --> 40:50.073
She'll always be a part of me.

40:52.742 --> 40:54.661
I know the Sphere as well as you do.

40:54.828 --> 40:56.204
And you'll need me there.

40:56.872 --> 40:58.123
David, listen,

40:59.040 --> 41:01.251
all I'm doing is looking out for you.

41:01.626 --> 41:02.711
What?

41:04.129 --> 41:05.755
You're crossing my name off?

41:06.506 --> 41:10.760
After all we've done
you're going to leave me on the sidelines?

41:14.097 --> 41:16.600
I can help you change the future.

41:18.101 --> 41:19.853
Don't take that away from me.

41:37.787 --> 41:40.040
-What?
-We can't leave it like that.

41:40.707 --> 41:43.627
We have to go back to the cave
and restore the settings.

41:44.336 --> 41:47.172
-But Ryan gave orders.
-Just you and me.

41:48.381 --> 41:50.050
We'll go out quietly.

41:51.968 --> 41:55.513
Whatever killed Peter is still in there.

41:56.139 --> 41:59.059
The Trojan is 30 kilometers away
from the cave right now,

41:59.476 --> 42:01.311
that means if it decides to come back

42:01.411 --> 42:03.840
we'll have at least
half an hour to get out.

42:03.959 --> 42:05.815
-What about Ryan?
-Ryan's too careful.

42:06.816 --> 42:08.360
He's wasting time.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.863
Lost days are lost lives.

42:13.823 --> 42:17.702
When Rita was dying,
you slowly died with her.

42:19.204 --> 42:20.622
I saw what that was like.

42:21.665 --> 42:26.544
Now imagine that entire planet
is dying the exact same way.

42:27.462 --> 42:31.800
Slowly, irreversibly,
from the same virus.

42:48.483 --> 42:49.859
What the hell is this?

42:50.402 --> 42:51.653
What's going on?

42:54.322 --> 42:55.699
The Sphere did this.

42:55.865 --> 42:58.576
-You think it was a malfunction?
-Not just a malfunction

42:59.160 --> 43:01.830
The Sphere is creating an alien life form.

43:02.289 --> 43:03.999
And incredibly quickly.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.584
Faster than it created life on Earth.

43:07.919 --> 43:10.547
We shouldn't touch it.
We need to discuss this with everybody.

43:10.714 --> 43:12.590
We need to set a plan of action.

43:12.924 --> 43:15.468
Someone readjusted
the settings on the Sphere.

43:21.308 --> 43:23.518
The Trojan's getting closer,
we gotta leave.

43:23.685 --> 43:24.644
Just a minute.

43:24.978 --> 43:25.812
Can't you hear me?

43:25.937 --> 43:28.398
There's no point in risking our lives!
Let's go!

43:28.565 --> 43:29.983
Get away from me, dammit!

43:38.783 --> 43:42.120
-Have you lost your mind?
-It's over! The mission is over!

43:42.287 --> 43:43.413
Deal with it!

43:45.248 --> 43:47.667
The Sphere is hostile!

43:50.086 --> 43:52.172
Put the gun down, David! Put it down!

43:52.547 --> 43:55.050
You wanna die
because of this piece of shit?

43:57.969 --> 44:00.013
Too late, it's already here.

45:35.984 --> 45:39.529
<i>Airlock closed.
Pressurization completed.</i>

45:46.369 --> 45:49.873
You're a psycho, Steve.
Because of you, we both almost died.

45:54.085 --> 45:58.882
This is not about us.
We have to complete the mission.

46:00.258 --> 46:03.636
If you had damaged the Sphere
all of this would've been for nothing.

46:04.053 --> 46:07.140
Then you should've shot me.
Why didn't you?

46:10.977 --> 46:13.688
If you threaten the mission one more time

46:14.272 --> 46:15.773
I will.

46:23.406 --> 46:27.410
Steve, what the hell were you doing?
Where were you?

46:27.994 --> 46:30.330
Why did you leave the lander
against my orders?

46:31.498 --> 46:33.291
We did what we had to.

46:40.590 --> 46:43.051
You no longer have the right
to make decisions.

46:44.427 --> 46:47.889
I make the decisions I find necessary.

46:48.389 --> 46:49.265
Or what?

46:49.432 --> 46:51.976
What are you gonna do?
Use force?

46:52.685 --> 46:54.729
Then go ahead! Well?

46:54.896 --> 46:55.980
Come on!

47:03.530 --> 47:05.907
<i>Module integrity compromised.</i>

47:07.951 --> 47:09.118
What did you do?

47:09.244 --> 47:11.120
<i>Module integrity compromised.</i>

47:14.999 --> 47:16.834
<i>Module integrity compromised.</i>

48:46.215 --> 48:47.216
Quiet, sweetie.

48:49.093 --> 48:50.928
We're so close I'm losing my head.

48:51.429 --> 48:52.555
What's that?

48:54.140 --> 48:55.725
Trojan's in the lander.

48:56.643 --> 49:00.188
Got a hole in the lower deck,
everything's covered in this shit.

49:00.355 --> 49:02.148
So what do we do now?

49:04.901 --> 49:07.945
Quietly, and slowly. Let's go.

49:21.501 --> 49:22.960
It's hard to breathe.

49:51.489 --> 49:52.448
Get back.

49:52.615 --> 49:54.450
What? Why?

49:56.619 --> 49:57.787
It's here.

50:18.391 --> 50:19.392
Run!

50:41.164 --> 50:42.832
What's happened?
Are you okay?

50:43.708 --> 50:44.917
The Trojan…

50:45.084 --> 50:46.836
The Trojan's in the laboratory.

50:48.504 --> 50:50.089
Do you realize what you've done?

50:50.214 --> 50:51.674
You brought it down here with you!

51:12.361 --> 51:14.989
-Can it get in here?
-We don't know.

51:15.656 --> 51:18.451
It damaged the generator
and the cameras aren't working.

51:18.826 --> 51:20.787
We've lost contact with the ship, so…

51:21.162 --> 51:23.289
We have no video from space.

51:25.458 --> 51:27.460
Here's the last video saved on the system.

51:27.627 --> 51:29.879
It was looking
for a weak spot in the hull.

51:32.965 --> 51:35.176
It got in through the cooling system.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.386
Where the steel is thinnest.

51:38.179 --> 51:40.807
So this thing is smart?
It can think?

51:41.140 --> 51:43.059
Whether it can think or not,

51:43.392 --> 51:47.688
if we smoke it out and with the hole shut
it can't crawl back in.

51:47.855 --> 51:49.690
But how? How can we smoke it out?

51:49.857 --> 51:51.734
We can't even see where it is.

51:52.944 --> 51:56.239
We have to restore the security cameras
and communications.

51:56.823 --> 52:01.494
The Trojan damaged the main generator,
but the life support system is working.

52:01.702 --> 52:04.247
That means the back up generator is fine.

52:04.413 --> 52:07.875
We can connect the network
and cameras to it.

52:08.292 --> 52:10.668
We will have to make
all the way blind to the fuse box

52:10.768 --> 52:13.530
with no idea where that bastard is.
It's too risky.

52:16.342 --> 52:17.760
It's all my fault.

52:18.803 --> 52:20.096
So I'll go.

52:22.890 --> 52:24.267
I'll watch your six.

54:37.817 --> 54:38.651
Steve,

54:38.818 --> 54:40.319
<i>you need to get out of there, now!</i>

55:37.043 --> 55:38.335
Are you hurt?

55:43.716 --> 55:45.551
How's the signal and the cameras?

55:46.886 --> 55:48.637
All there. Back online.

55:48.846 --> 55:52.892
Damn it! It's transmitting an EMP field
stronger than the Sphere.

55:53.059 --> 55:55.352
The electronics next to it
are going crazy.

55:55.686 --> 55:57.021
So what now?

56:00.775 --> 56:03.571
Have you ever seen a raging bull
running after the crowds

56:03.671 --> 56:05.873
down a narrow passage
just before a bull fight?

56:07.782 --> 56:09.408
The bull wants to catch the runners,

56:10.242 --> 56:12.912
but he ends up in the arena
with the matador.

56:13.662 --> 56:17.124
The Trojan is the bull.
It also wants to catch us.

56:18.626 --> 56:22.421
We have a chance to lead it
wherever we want, like outside the lander.

56:23.422 --> 56:25.049
It's a huge risk for everyone,

56:26.217 --> 56:27.468
but it's all worth it.

56:37.937 --> 56:39.105
The lander has two airlocks:

56:39.980 --> 56:42.525
the central one, and the one in the lab.

56:43.567 --> 56:46.654
I'll be outside
in front of the open central hatch.

56:47.613 --> 56:49.031
I'll be the main decoy.

56:51.534 --> 56:54.203
The Trojan will chase me
along the corridors.

56:55.079 --> 56:59.708
Once we get outside, you'll shut
the engines to the airlock behind it.

57:00.042 --> 57:01.297
Understood?

57:01.397 --> 57:05.673
But in order to do all that,
we need to get to the airlocks.

57:06.090 --> 57:07.967
And that's where the Trojan is.

57:08.592 --> 57:11.679
We can isolate it
in the main corridor, here.

57:11.846 --> 57:13.973
The inner doors won't hold on long,

57:14.974 --> 57:16.809
but should buy us some time.

57:19.162 --> 57:22.148
<i>I'll lure him into the inter-hatch space.
And lock him in</i>

58:37.223 --> 58:41.310
<i>After the Trojan is blocked, each one
of us will report to a specific location.</i>

58:42.269 --> 58:45.272
<i>David, you and I will open
the air hatch in the labs.</i>

58:46.482 --> 58:47.738
<i>You'll wait for me there,</i>

58:48.087 --> 58:52.029
<i>while I'll go outside
to be the bait for the Trojan.</i>

58:52.112 --> 58:54.990
But in order for the Trojan
to see me and come out

58:55.658 --> 58:59.370
both sides of the airlock
have to be open,

58:59.536 --> 59:01.580
outside and inside.

59:02.248 --> 59:05.584
That's why Leona
will manually open the airlock

59:06.502 --> 59:09.088
and hide right here,
in the technical bay.

59:43.205 --> 59:46.583
<i>When the Trojan comes after me,
it will run over here,</i>

59:47.001 --> 59:49.461
<i>past the Engine's steering nozzles.</i>

59:49.628 --> 59:51.380
<i>There should be some fuel left.</i>

59:52.589 --> 59:54.925
<i>And if we turn the Engine
at the right moment</i>

59:55.551 --> 59:58.637
<i>we won't just smoke it out,
we'll roast it.</i>

59:59.513 --> 01:00:01.432
<i>Get out of here, you fucking bastard!</i>

01:00:02.141 --> 01:00:04.101
<i>Hurry! It won't hold up much longer!</i>

01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:06.854
Don't panic. Release the Trojan.

01:00:07.021 --> 01:00:09.023
Hide in the tech bay.

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:10.607
You can do it.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.050
<i>I'm turning on the Engine.</i>

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:38.385
It's not working.
The Trojan is messing with the system.

01:00:38.761 --> 01:00:40.012
Steve, run!

01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:51.690
The Engine's on.

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:53.901
Leona, get out! Get out!

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:13.629
<i>Ryan, the airlock!
Shut the airlock!</i>

01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:21.929
Shit!

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:43.742
Rest in peace, Frank.

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:14.481
A part of its tentacle was cut off
by the door. It returned to the cave.

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.614
<i>Pressurization complete.</i>

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:25.534
<i>Oxygen level returning to normal.</i>

01:02:30.456 --> 01:02:32.416
It won't get back in here.

01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:34.835
But the Sphere is under its control.

01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:37.588
Not for long.

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:46.930
Amy.

01:02:48.307 --> 01:02:49.475
What is it?

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:53.145
It's the virus…

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:57.858
It's already in our home, literally.

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:02.654
You shouldn't go on this mission.

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:06.033
Amy, what are you talking about?
We discussed everything.

01:03:08.202 --> 01:03:10.537
You've done enough.
This isn't your mission.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:14.208
-Excuse me?
-You're not even an astronaut.

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:20.714
You want me

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:24.051
to walk out a week before the launch?

01:03:24.426 --> 01:03:25.969
What's gotten into you?

01:03:31.642 --> 01:03:33.310
We're going to have a baby.

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:40.025
What?

01:03:41.944 --> 01:03:43.153
Just stay.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.949
We'll work on the vaccine.
I found a promising pathway.

01:03:47.533 --> 01:03:51.119
The mission will create a new Earth
but we could save this one.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:54.559
This is my blueprint for the vaccine,
please go over it.

01:03:55.062 --> 01:03:56.367
I'm really happy.

01:03:57.668 --> 01:03:59.378
But it's such poor timing.

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:03.465
I won't get to see him grow up.

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:08.387
Steve, I'm begging you.
Please, stay with me. Stay with us.

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:11.848
I can't, I have to be there. I have to.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:13.809
You've done everything you could.

01:04:13.976 --> 01:04:16.895
We can develop the vaccine now.
I think I'm onto something.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.065
I need to save the Earth.

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:41.744
We have to study this creature,

01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:44.524
so we can understand
what you're infected with.

01:04:56.935 --> 01:04:59.730
My guess, it's a bio-robot.

01:05:15.454 --> 01:05:18.624
These are the same materials
the Sphere is made of.

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:32.262
And they also change their properties
when they come into contact with water.

01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:36.558
We studied it never understanding

01:05:36.725 --> 01:05:41.229
that one of its functions
was to create a Trojan.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.608
Maybe they are much more advanced
than we are.

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:47.819
And better.

01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:05.921
David, listen…

01:06:10.384 --> 01:06:11.760
Tell me what you found.

01:06:15.389 --> 01:06:17.683
The bacteria that infected you

01:06:19.518 --> 01:06:22.938
have an unusually powerful
defense mechanism.

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:34.116
I studied them.

01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:36.159
Figured out how they work.

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:40.330
This is what we spent
all those years searching for.

01:06:43.959 --> 01:06:47.177
Your blood holds the key
to the vaccine against the virus

01:06:47.816 --> 01:06:49.715
that's been destroying life on Earth.

01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:52.843
It doesn't change anything.

01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:54.803
Don't you understand?

01:06:55.554 --> 01:06:57.305
We can save the world.

01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:02.060
And it's all because of you.
You are the real hero.

01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:09.401
I'll administer some painkillers,
you'll feel better.

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.036
Here goes nothing…

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:33.527
What was that?

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:38.073
David…

01:08:39.908 --> 01:08:41.701
It's a transponder.

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:46.247
We can see the connections
of the Sphere.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:51.877
This is their way
of colonizing planets.

01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:54.089
<i>How's it going?</i>

01:08:56.091 --> 01:08:57.551
<i>It's a bio-robot.</i>

01:08:57.926 --> 01:09:00.136
<i>We have to find
a way to destroy it</i>

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.430
and restore the settings in the Sphere.

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:07.102
<i>No, Steve. Too many people
have died because of you already.</i>

01:09:09.563 --> 01:09:11.773
<i>Wait. What did you do?</i>

01:09:14.276 --> 01:09:15.652
<i>Did you lock me in?</i>

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.529
<i>You are under arrest, Steve.</i>

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:20.198
<i>Ryan,</i>

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.617
<i>we have to work together.</i>

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:25.453
<i>For Peter, and Frank and Leona.</i>

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:27.997
<i>Otherwise they all died in vain--</i>

01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:30.584
<i>People are expendable to you.</i>

01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:34.254
<i>Ryan! Ryan!</i>

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:37.883
He's right.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:50.228
It was never the salvation of humanity
that was most important to you, Steve.

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:53.314
You always wanna play the hero.

01:09:55.567 --> 01:10:00.030
And now you just want to win and you
don't care about other people's lives.

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:33.605
Amy, talk to me.

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:44.366
I read your proposal.
It looks truly promising.

01:10:46.034 --> 01:10:47.494
A real breakthrough.

01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:51.331
A chance to create a vaccine.
Finally, a real one.

01:10:57.212 --> 01:11:00.382
But I do need to go.
For our sake.

01:11:04.386 --> 01:11:06.304
I don't know what I'll do without you

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:09.724
but I promise I'll come back.

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:13.937
I need you.

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:17.232
Both of you.

01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:25.448
Tell him…

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:28.410
or her…

01:11:29.661 --> 01:11:34.207
that Daddy like a God
is out creating the new Earth.

01:11:38.128 --> 01:11:41.006
You keep saying
you're doing this to save everyone.

01:11:41.673 --> 01:11:43.341
But who is everyone?

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:45.969
You don't see people around you.

01:11:46.845 --> 01:11:51.224
All you care about is you
and your project. Why even bother?

01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:54.602
To be the hailed a savior? Is that it?

01:12:01.443 --> 01:12:02.986
To save our future.

01:12:07.157 --> 01:12:09.951
I wonder what it is
you're really trying to save.

01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:42.442
Richard, you modeled the trajectories
of the nearest stars?

01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:45.862
That didn't give us anything.
What do you think you'll find there?

01:12:46.613 --> 01:12:48.421
You said that when we made the jump

01:12:48.521 --> 01:12:51.951
we moved along a coordinate axis
that was inaccessible to us.

01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:55.163
And what if that axis wasn't spatial?

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:00.668
Show us how these stars will look

01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:04.464
accounting the expansion of the universe
over four billion years.

01:13:07.175 --> 01:13:08.927
<i>Yes, recalculating.</i>

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:25.276
We didn't move in space.

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:28.446
We moved in time.

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:31.366
It's Ursa Major.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.077
And Orion.

01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:37.122
And there's the North Star…

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:39.624
and our…

01:13:42.502 --> 01:13:43.628
Sun?

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:56.015
And the Earth was silent and empty,

01:13:57.308 --> 01:14:00.520
and the darkness over the abyss.

01:14:04.232 --> 01:14:06.484
That means that we're on Earth?

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:10.155
Before the beginning of life itself?

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:22.584
About four billion years ago.

01:14:25.003 --> 01:14:26.671
How did you figure that out?

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.848
This is the fragment
that flew off the Sphere

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:38.558
when David fired at it.

01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:42.187
Here is the broken fragment.

01:14:43.605 --> 01:14:46.983
And here is the same piece
on the bracelet I made for Amy.

01:14:52.614 --> 01:14:55.366
Because it's the exact same fragment.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.914
The Sphere here and the old one on Earth

01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:04.459
are the exact same Sphere,

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:07.837
but in different times.

01:15:09.172 --> 01:15:12.342
Some civilization sent the Sphere on Earth

01:15:12.467 --> 01:15:15.511
to create a biosphere suitable for them.

01:15:16.387 --> 01:15:18.014
But something went wrong.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:21.017
But that means no matter what we do here,

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:25.021
we won't save the people on Earth?

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:27.607
There's only one option left,

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:31.194
tell Amy about those
extraterrestrial bacteria

01:15:32.237 --> 01:15:34.322
and help her to create the vaccine.

01:15:35.782 --> 01:15:37.200
How do you plan to do that?

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:43.581
We know that the Sphere will remain
in the cave until our time.

01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:51.506
And that I will make this fragment
into a bracelet for Amy.

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:57.720
I'll write her a message
telling her how to connect the Spheres.

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:10.483
But Amy had the bracelet before we left.

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:12.318
And she didn't say anything about it.

01:16:14.404 --> 01:16:16.364
I believe Amy will miss me.

01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:19.752
She will come for the bracelet,

01:16:20.169 --> 01:16:23.037
and sooner or later
she will see these inscriptions.

01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:26.624
What's left is to put the part back

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:28.376
and reconfigure the system.

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:31.963
Or the life that we ​​know

01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:34.632
will never appear.

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:37.385
Neither will humanity.

01:18:17.068 --> 01:18:18.736
<i>Steve! Steve!</i>

01:18:19.404 --> 01:18:21.406
Ryan is planning on blowing up the Sphere.

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:23.866
Connect me to him.

01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:27.870
He switched off his radio.

01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:29.247
You need to find him

01:18:29.414 --> 01:18:30.706
<i>and explain everything.</i>

01:18:31.833 --> 01:18:33.918
<i>Go, I've re-opened the airlock.</i>

01:19:04.115 --> 01:19:05.366
Stop right there.

01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:09.203
Ryan…

01:19:12.457 --> 01:19:14.750
The Sphere is our only chance.

01:19:15.835 --> 01:19:17.462
Don't even try.

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:21.591
Okay. Okay.

01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:24.302
But your plan still won't work.

01:19:27.472 --> 01:19:28.514
It will.

01:19:29.724 --> 01:19:30.850
You'll see.

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:34.479
You want to take the bomb to the cave,

01:19:35.563 --> 01:19:40.151
wait for the Trojan there
and blow it up along with the Sphere.

01:19:41.444 --> 01:19:43.279
But what if it attacks you on the way?

01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:48.117
Then I will go up

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:50.870
in smoke with him.

01:19:52.205 --> 01:19:53.706
And you will lose.

01:19:55.333 --> 01:20:00.379
After all, the Sphere will continue
to create the environment

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:02.215
that the Trojan needs.

01:20:03.674 --> 01:20:07.512
What do you suggest?
You got a better idea?

01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:10.014
Let's lure in the Trojan,

01:20:10.765 --> 01:20:12.183
into the lander,

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:16.604
lock the airlocks and blow it up.

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:18.189
Here.

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:25.029
David, why?

01:20:26.656 --> 01:20:27.865
For Rita.

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:33.579
-She died.
-She hasn't died yet.

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:37.625
-You're deranged.
-I'm not.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:44.257
After what have happened
in the cave, I understand.

01:20:52.223 --> 01:20:53.792
The Trojan didn't kill me,

01:20:54.921 --> 01:21:00.259
and it doesn't do anything
without a reason.

01:21:05.111 --> 01:21:06.612
It chose me.

01:21:08.573 --> 01:21:10.074
And I will help it.

01:21:11.576 --> 01:21:13.619
We weren't supposed to be here.

01:21:13.953 --> 01:21:15.371
We're a mistake.

01:21:16.247 --> 01:21:20.042
And you are the one
who helped me understand that.

01:21:28.676 --> 01:21:31.887
I realized that we all
are just like you, Steve.

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:34.223
We weren't created right.

01:21:35.099 --> 01:21:37.560
We're a malfunction of the Sphere.

01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:42.523
But I will fix it.

01:21:43.733 --> 01:21:45.985
David, wake up!

01:21:46.152 --> 01:21:48.070
You can't help Rita like that!

01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:52.325
She wouldn't be born to suffer,

01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:55.620
and she will not die at the age of eight.

01:21:56.871 --> 01:21:58.576
No ones else will suffer, Steve,

01:21:58.676 --> 01:22:02.080
because there will never be
any people to begin with.

01:22:12.011 --> 01:22:14.972
People deserve a chance, David.

01:22:16.057 --> 01:22:17.642
People don't change.

01:26:52.958 --> 01:26:54.418
<i>Encounter to Mission.</i>

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:56.670
Encounter to Mission.

01:26:58.088 --> 01:27:02.343
Encounter to Mission.
Encounter to Mission.

01:27:04.303 --> 01:27:05.638
Come in, Mission.

01:27:07.473 --> 01:27:08.766
Come on, guys.

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:11.393
Encounter to Mission….

01:27:14.855 --> 01:27:15.898
<i>Encounter to Mission.</i>

01:27:18.817 --> 01:27:19.985
<i>Encounter to Mission!</i>

01:27:23.364 --> 01:27:24.531
<i>Encounter to Mission!</i>

01:27:27.534 --> 01:27:28.661
<i>Encounter to Mission!</i>

01:27:31.705 --> 01:27:32.790
Richard.

01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:35.334
Steve! Thank God!

01:27:35.876 --> 01:27:37.753
I saw the explosion on camera.

01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:40.089
<i>-I thought you were all…</i>
-The Trojan's been destroyed.

01:27:43.759 --> 01:27:46.553
-What about Ryan?
<i>-He didn't make it.</i>

01:27:55.062 --> 01:27:58.190
<i>Steve, your oxygen levels are dropping.</i>

01:27:58.857 --> 01:28:01.443
Looks like some shrapnel pierced the tank.

01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:05.906
-How much time do I have?
<i>-About an hour.</i>

01:28:07.116 --> 01:28:10.285
<i>Look, I'll land the ship and pick you up.</i>

01:28:10.411 --> 01:28:14.123
No, there's a storm here. You'll crash.

01:28:15.749 --> 01:28:17.209
And what are you gonna do?

01:28:17.918 --> 01:28:21.296
<i>I'm going to the cave.
I need to contact Amy.</i>

01:28:22.172 --> 01:28:25.134
Land the ship
as soon as the storm settles down.

01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:28.053
Godspeed, Steve.

01:30:52.739 --> 01:30:54.241
Please start working.

01:31:11.592 --> 01:31:12.551
Steve!

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:20.642
Amy?

01:31:29.943 --> 01:31:31.361
Steve!

01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:34.156
Where are you?

01:31:35.115 --> 01:31:38.827
-I'm somewhere in the distant past.
-What do you mean?

01:31:39.161 --> 01:31:43.749
We don't have much time.
I know how to save the Earth.

01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:46.168
You were on the right path.

01:31:46.668 --> 01:31:50.339
There's a mechanism
that can help us create the vaccine.

01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:53.467
I saw it here with my own eyes.

01:31:54.426 --> 01:31:57.596
-Can you write something down?
-Sure. Sure.

01:32:01.892 --> 01:32:04.501
You have to teach the plant cells

01:32:04.601 --> 01:32:08.023
to quickly identify
any mutation of the virus.

01:32:08.732 --> 01:32:10.692
Here's the antigen formula.

01:32:11.026 --> 01:32:13.487
Amy, I promised
I'd come back to see you.

01:32:14.279 --> 01:32:15.739
I'm so sorry.

01:32:19.076 --> 01:32:22.788
-No. Steve…
-I only regret one thing…

01:32:26.792 --> 01:32:28.752
That I'll never hold you again

01:32:31.338 --> 01:32:32.923
and our child.

01:32:35.842 --> 01:32:37.511
We're connected, remember?

01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:41.598
You'll always be with me. With us.

01:32:56.321 --> 01:32:58.824
I love you. Both of you.

01:33:11.503 --> 01:33:12.671
Steve.

01:33:15.048 --> 01:33:16.383
I love you.

01:33:17.926 --> 01:33:19.219
Steve…

01:34:25.869 --> 01:34:29.956
<i>The Earth, O Lord,
is full of God mercy.</i>

01:34:31.208 --> 01:34:33.335
<i>Teach me thy statutes.</i>

01:34:34.086 --> 01:34:36.421
<i>Teach me good judgment and knowledge.</i>

01:34:37.756 --> 01:34:40.384
<i>Before I was afflicted I went astray.</i>

01:34:41.843 --> 01:34:43.553
<i>But now have I kept thy word.</i>

01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:48.433
<i>Thy hands have made me and fashioned me.</i>

01:34:49.893 --> 01:34:53.188
<i>Let thy tender mercies come unto me,</i>

01:34:54.981 --> 01:34:57.317
<i>that I may live.</i>
