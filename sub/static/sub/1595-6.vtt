going to knock it on the head.

Can't you just go round
and see what she's thinking?

07:13.687 --> 07:15.484
No way, you go round.

07:15.527 --> 07:19.406

that little box with the 2p's in?

07:35.207 --> 07:36.799
What's goin' on?

07:36.847 --> 07:39.361
Remember that article you showed me
about the dog that joined Mensa?

07:39.407 --> 07:41.159
Yeah.

07:41.207 --> 07:44.597
On the other side there was a
piece about toxins in breast milk.

07:44.647 --> 07:48.686
Everything that goes into me
goes into them.

07:48.727 --> 07:52.356

He's right, Mam,
you just can't throw them out.

08:05.407 --> 08:08.365
You'll be climbing the fuckin' walls.

08:08.407 --> 08:12.685
Sometimes, Frank,
we have to make sacrifices.

08:12.727 --> 08:14.206
Look at Joan of Arc.

08:19.887 --> 08:22.276
l've got to go now, mum.

08:22.687 --> 08:27.078
A pint of Dog, when you're ready,
please, stout yeoman.

08:28.927 --> 08:34.047
One pound and ninety pence.

08:36.927 --> 08:40.681
So, that's £1 .90 off your tab, in't it, Frank?

08:40.727 --> 08:44.879
'Ey, wait, no, because that's not
playing by the fuckin' rules.

08:44.927 --> 08:46.565
And what rules were those, Frank?

08:46.607 --> 08:48.723
This is a pub, not a charity.

08:48.767 --> 08:53.921
That's £365

08:53.967 --> 08:56.800
and l want every penny back.

09:05.047 --> 09:06.480
Dad wants words.

09:11.487 --> 09:13.523
You know why we've brought you.

09:13.567 --> 09:15.922
Our Mandy can't keep secrets.

09:15.967 --> 09:17.685
Not from her mother.

09:17.727 --> 09:20.366
l only have to look
in the them pretty brown eyes

09:20.407 --> 09:23.319
to know exactly what's going on, up here.

09:24.487 --> 09:27.206

our Mandy,

09:29.127 --> 09:34.804

and you've turned her into a woman.

09:42.727 --> 09:44.524
Welcome to the family.

09:50.767 --> 09:55.158
My Mimi was up the duff when we got hitched,
don't you worry about it.

09:55.207 --> 09:56.322
Well done!

10:09.447 --> 10:11.085
Tell me that you love her.

10:11.127 --> 10:13.766
l love her. Honest, Mimi, l love her.

10:13.807 --> 10:16.446
You'd better, lan,

10:16.487 --> 10:20.526
because she's our princess, Mandy,
and if you ever

10:20.567 --> 10:22.444
do anything to hurt her

10:24.567 --> 10:27.286
your bollocks come off.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.716
Come on, let's get pissed.

10:35.447 --> 10:37.915
What are we gonna do, Mandy?

10:40.807 --> 10:43.037
You could not have it.

10:43.087 --> 10:47.080
You could just pretend that you lost it,
it happens all the time.

10:47.127 --> 10:49.561
- Cindy Baler lost to kids before...
- lan!

10:49.607 --> 10:52.963
We're Catholics, mum's pro-life.

10:53.007 --> 10:54.759
She deals drugs out the back door.

10:54.807 --> 10:56.286
So?

10:58.927 --> 11:01.566
lt's not the end of the world.

11:01.607 --> 11:04.041
lt's a baby.

11:04.087 --> 11:05.566
We'll deal with it.

11:13.407 --> 11:15.716
She's gonna have it. There's no two ways.

11:15.767 --> 11:19.442
You're gonna be a dad and
everyone's gonna think it's mine.

11:19.487 --> 11:22.047
They've even got frigging names lined up.

11:22.087 --> 11:24.442
So what do you suggest, lan?

11:24.487 --> 11:26.318
Announce the truth?

11:26.367 --> 11:29.518
Because that would mean exposing
your little secret, bum boy.

11:33.847 --> 11:35.041
Unnnh!

Aah!

12:04.647 --> 12:06.603
Would you keep it?

12:13.127 --> 12:14.480
Would you want me to?

12:16.047 --> 12:18.003
Dunno. Sort of.

12:18.047 --> 12:19.560
lt wouldn't be so bad with you.

12:19.607 --> 12:22.075
You know how to sweet-talk a girl.

12:22.127 --> 12:23.401
No, l mean...

12:25.407 --> 12:27.125
you're older.

12:27.167 --> 12:29.761
You'd know what you wanted.

12:29.807 --> 12:31.923
Don't worry, Lip.

13:10.567 --> 13:11.522
Where's the fire?

13:11.567 --> 13:14.479
Kid that just legged it in here -
don't deny it, l saw him -

13:14.527 --> 13:18.805
snatched my bag last night.
l want it back or l'm calling the police.

13:18.847 --> 13:20.644
Dylan!

13:20.687 --> 13:22.279
Out here now.

13:24.767 --> 13:27.440

- This lady thinks you took her bag...

13:27.487 --> 13:28.886
Don't think. He did.

13:28.927 --> 13:31.725
Thinks you might have
taken her bag last night.

13:31.767 --> 13:35.555
- No. She's lying.
- Why would she do that, Dylan?

13:35.607 --> 13:37.677
Dunno but l ain't got no bag
and l ain't seen her before.

13:38.887 --> 13:40.957
Maybe you've got the wrong kid.

13:45.047 --> 13:47.117
Little wanker.

13:47.167 --> 13:50.000
Fine. l'll see what the police
have to say about it.

14:10.487 --> 14:12.762

14:12.807 --> 14:16.197
All those pills were clogging up my system.

14:27.447 --> 14:31.281
Well, like Francis of Assisi said
when he got the stigmata,

14:31.327 --> 14:32.726

14:32.767 --> 14:33.802

15:03.407 --> 15:04.999
Not any more he isn't. >

15:05.047 --> 15:09.563
The day he got my Mandy pregnant
is the day he earned himself respect.

Unless you think that doesn't apply.

15:38.087 --> 15:40.999
Hey, hey... lt's all right, l'll just...

15:41.047 --> 15:43.277
lan... l'll come quietly.

15:43.327 --> 15:46.956
Jesus, lan!
(What the fuck are you doing here?)

15:47.007 --> 15:49.043
Shut it!

15:49.087 --> 15:50.566
You know this joker, lan?

15:50.607 --> 15:52.757
Yeah, that's my dad.

15:55.567 --> 15:57.125
Granddaddy Gallagher.

15:57.167 --> 15:58.566
LAUGHTER

15:59.927 --> 16:03.317
lt's a good job you found
a proper family to belong to.

16:04.207 --> 16:05.435
Was there something else?

16:05.487 --> 16:06.556
What? No.

16:06.607 --> 16:08.598
Well, piss off back under your stone.

16:13.967 --> 16:15.161
Drink up.

16:16.927 --> 16:18.838
We'll get you another at The Crosses.

16:36.847 --> 16:39.839
Your address was on the work pass.

16:39.887 --> 16:42.959
All about pride with kids, isn't it?

16:43.007 --> 16:45.237
He thinks he's street, giving it the mouth.

16:45.287 --> 16:47.357
He's one strike away
from a young offenders.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.045
Shouldn't nick people's bags, then.

16:49.087 --> 16:50.076
l agree.

16:50.127 --> 16:54.040
Stepbrother. Doesn't even live here,
just darts in when he needs a quick getaway.

16:57.367 --> 16:59.164
Something missing?

16:59.207 --> 17:00.606
Tenner.

17:02.247 --> 17:06.001
No, forget it. lt was the bag l wanted.

17:10.207 --> 17:13.915
Craig, by the way.

17:13.967 --> 17:15.844
Fiona.

17:28.687 --> 17:31.121
Under what circumstances

17:31.167 --> 17:34.159
would l be called granddad?

17:37.767 --> 17:40.156
l'm no expert, Frank,
but l would say it would be

17:40.207 --> 17:42.675
when one of your kids has a baby.

17:42.727 --> 17:45.480
Exactly. But the question is,

17:45.527 --> 17:49.486
which one? The first one, obvious choice.

17:49.527 --> 17:50.562
Frank, l've got no idea.

17:50.607 --> 17:53.326
Who is our lan's girlfriend?

17:53.367 --> 17:56.165
Mandy Maguire, has been for ages.

17:56.207 --> 17:57.686
But they're not even...

17:59.567 --> 18:00.841
No, he hasn't...?

18:02.567 --> 18:04.797
Oh, fucking hell.

18:05.287 --> 18:09.041
Fucking... Granddad.

18:11.207 --> 18:14.085
My old man said be a Man U fan

18:14.127 --> 18:17.517
(Maguires) But l said fuck off you're a cunt.
Oh yeah!

18:17.567 --> 18:19.478
LAUGHTER

18:19.527 --> 18:22.519
THEY CHANT

18:22.567 --> 18:24.478
Dad, there's Vinnie MacKinnon.

18:24.527 --> 18:26.563
Yee-ha! Catch him, son.

18:27.287 --> 18:28.640
All right, Vinnie?

18:28.687 --> 18:31.155
Hello there, Vinnie?
How are you doin', son?

18:31.207 --> 18:32.196
TYRES SQUEAL

18:32.247 --> 18:34.124
Hold it there, boys. Out you get.

18:35.127 --> 18:36.242
Come on, lan!

18:36.727 --> 18:39.082
(Maguires) Yee-ha!

18:49.607 --> 18:50.835
Whoa!

18:52.807 --> 18:55.275
People have got to learn
to pay their debts, lan.

18:55.327 --> 18:57.363
You're one of us now.

18:57.407 --> 18:59.682
Need anything sorting,

18:59.727 --> 19:01.206
say the word.

19:03.007 --> 19:05.043
All right, all right, lads.

19:05.087 --> 19:07.157
Pack it in!

19:07.207 --> 19:10.199
Still want his mammy to recognise him.

19:10.247 --> 19:12.522
lan, hold those.

19:13.127 --> 19:15.163
Maguire takes it on the chest,
beats one man.

19:15.207 --> 19:17.163
- Uh!
- What a goal!

19:17.207 --> 19:20.438
What a goal from Patrick Maguire.

19:20.487 --> 19:24.719
ln the dying seconds, he makes it 2-0
and that surely is it,

19:24.767 --> 19:26.997
the World Cup is theirs.

19:28.447 --> 19:30.642
Hey, lan, come on!

19:43.247 --> 19:44.760
< BLOWS NOSE

19:45.767 --> 19:46.802
lan?

19:48.407 --> 19:49.476
lan!

19:49.527 --> 19:51.995
Piss off, Lip.

19:52.047 --> 19:53.958
lan, look at me.

19:54.007 --> 19:56.362
Go fuck yourself.

19:56.407 --> 19:58.204
We have to talk about this.

19:58.247 --> 20:01.922
lt's not just your problem.
l'm the one in the shit.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.640
Listen to me, you smart-ass prick.

20:04.687 --> 20:08.043
The hardest family on the estate
think l'm their fucking son-in-law.

20:08.087 --> 20:09.202
And why?

20:09.247 --> 20:11.442
Why? Because of you.

20:11.487 --> 20:14.638
Like you had no part in it.
Why have you got a fake bird, lan?

20:14.687 --> 20:16.598
Because it suited you.

20:17.287 --> 20:18.276
Because...

20:19.247 --> 20:23.957
that's what you are. That is
what you do you, fucking queen.

20:28.887 --> 20:30.718
Ask me where l've been today?

20:32.447 --> 20:33.926
Fucking ask me.

20:35.767 --> 20:36.756
Football.

20:37.847 --> 20:39.075
With the Maguires.

20:39.127 --> 20:42.199
A few beers, bit of a laugh.
Oh, yeah, and on the way home

20:42.247 --> 20:44.124
we kicked the crap out of somebody.

20:44.167 --> 20:45.646
And not just a kicking, Lip.

20:45.687 --> 20:48.042
They hammered him.
And l mean hammered.

20:48.087 --> 20:51.045
And they enjoyed it.
l can't be part of that family.

20:51.087 --> 20:53.965
They're maniacs.
Proper fucking maniacs.

20:54.007 --> 20:56.521
This is your mistake, you live with it.

20:56.967 --> 21:01.358
GRUNTlNG

21:01.847 --> 21:04.407
(Fiona) Break it up. Pack it in, the pair of you.

21:04.447 --> 21:05.721
Oi, oi, oi!

21:06.927 --> 21:07.962
Oi! Oi!

21:09.087 --> 21:10.486
Come on!

21:11.527 --> 21:13.085
Tell me what's going on.

21:19.447 --> 21:21.039
CLEARS THROAT

21:29.087 --> 21:31.840
- Somebody better start talking.
- lt's nothing to do with me.

21:36.767 --> 21:40.521
Must have been hidden. Must have
come out when we were scrapping.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.842
Well, if it doesn't belong
to either of you...

21:42.887 --> 21:45.526
Fiona, my dad's here.
Says he wants a word with you.

21:47.767 --> 21:50.679
l'm just saying
she doesn't look her usual self.

21:50.727 --> 21:53.241
Well, you'd better learn to keep that shut!

21:53.287 --> 21:57.599
Oh, here he is! Mr Big Shot!
Mr Friend Of The Fucking Maguires!

21:57.647 --> 22:01.037
Well, you better tell us
your big secret, Mr Big Shot.

22:01.087 --> 22:05.205
l thought it was just me,
but no other fucker seems to know.

22:05.247 --> 22:09.081
Leave him alone, dad. He doesn't
have to tell us until he's ready.

22:09.127 --> 22:13.279
What you on about? He's got a bird
up the duff, we've a right to know!

22:13.327 --> 22:15.636
Especially that slapper!

22:18.487 --> 22:20.478
Fuck off!

22:20.527 --> 22:23.599
Fuck off the lot of youse!
Leave me alone!

22:26.007 --> 22:28.157
Can l have his haddock?

22:31.127 --> 22:33.880
What can we do
to put a smile on them chops?

22:33.927 --> 22:36.077
Chuck yourself off a bridge.

22:36.127 --> 22:38.277
You don't mean that, Frank.

22:41.367 --> 22:43.403
l just found out...

22:43.447 --> 22:46.996
my son's going to have a kiddie.

22:47.047 --> 22:51.325
1 5-year-old lad,
got his girlfriend lumbered.

22:51.367 --> 22:55.679
He's just tossed his life away
before it's started.

22:57.487 --> 23:00.445
What's the sodding world coming to, eh?

23:00.487 --> 23:03.365
This isn't about him at all, is it, Frank?

23:05.407 --> 23:08.524
Hey, l bet you don't look
at me and think ''grandma''.

23:08.567 --> 23:10.046
Huh.

23:10.087 --> 23:12.760
lt doesn't mean you start wearing
zip-up slippers, you know?

23:30.247 --> 23:31.646
Tell you what.

23:31.687 --> 23:34.121
What?

23:34.167 --> 23:35.998
l'll buy you a drink.

24:02.007 --> 24:04.601
Hey, thought we should have a talk.

24:04.647 --> 24:07.207
What for?

24:07.247 --> 24:08.999
Cos we never do.

24:09.047 --> 24:10.526
So?

24:13.407 --> 24:15.602
Carl?

24:15.647 --> 24:18.764
We'll still love you,
you know, no matter what.

24:21.087 --> 24:24.045
lt's nothing to be ashamed of.

24:24.087 --> 24:26.555
What isn't?

24:34.047 --> 24:36.720
That's not mine. lt's gay!

24:41.207 --> 24:42.879
KNOCK AT DOOR

24:45.007 --> 24:49.364
Dylan sent you these. As an apology.

24:49.407 --> 24:52.319
Dylan sent them?

24:54.087 --> 24:58.365
OK, might have been my idea.

24:58.407 --> 25:00.159
Tell me to piss off if you want.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.960
No. l appreciate it.

25:06.247 --> 25:08.807
They're beautiful.

25:08.847 --> 25:10.724
Oh!

25:14.487 --> 25:16.478
lt's a long story.

25:18.127 --> 25:19.845
Do you fancy a drink?

25:25.527 --> 25:28.837
You have to tell them, lan.
lt's the only way out.

25:28.887 --> 25:30.002
- The Maguires?
- Kash!

25:30.047 --> 25:33.756
You know, what do you think
they're going to say?

25:33.807 --> 25:37.163
They'll hate him for it.
He won't just be a liar,

25:37.207 --> 25:38.560
he'll be a queer liar.

25:38.607 --> 25:43.761
So what's your advice?
Live a lie? Marriage? Kids?

25:46.127 --> 25:48.721
Mandy's a nice girl, lan.

25:48.767 --> 25:50.917
You can't do that to her.

25:50.967 --> 25:53.720
You can't do that to yourself.

25:55.807 --> 25:58.526
You're not doing the honourable thing.

25:58.567 --> 26:01.445
You're just ruining everyone's life.

26:21.447 --> 26:23.517
So...

26:23.567 --> 26:28.277
There's no mum, she pissed off years ago
and moved in with another woman.

26:28.327 --> 26:30.443
What, ''moved in'' moved in?

26:30.487 --> 26:32.921
Yes!

26:32.967 --> 26:38.246
You can't say she didn't give being
straight a decent shot. Six kids.

26:38.287 --> 26:40.482
Who's the bloke?

26:43.767 --> 26:45.723
Sorry, grab another drink.

26:45.767 --> 26:48.281
lan?

26:48.327 --> 26:50.363
l don't wanna talk about it.

26:50.407 --> 26:53.717
OK. You know l'm here when you do.

26:58.207 --> 27:00.641
Listen. l should get back.

27:04.247 --> 27:06.841
No.

27:09.887 --> 27:12.640
Stay.

27:21.047 --> 27:25.165
He writes me these letters, begging,
pleading with me to stand by him.

27:25.207 --> 27:26.606
Yeah.

27:26.647 --> 27:29.923
l wouldn't mind, but he's doing life!

27:31.127 --> 27:33.083
You get lonely, though.

27:33.127 --> 27:36.676
All them nights sleeping on your own.

27:38.247 --> 27:43.275
Yeah, l'm the same.
Single bloke on me own. lt's not easy.

27:44.287 --> 27:49.600
Yeah. Sometimes all you want
is the warmth of another body

27:49.647 --> 27:51.763
next to yours.

27:55.487 --> 27:58.638
Do you fancy clearing that bar tab, Frank?

27:58.687 --> 28:01.406
Does the Pope shit in the woods?

28:10.927 --> 28:13.043
We're talking...all of it?

28:14.527 --> 28:17.997
Like it never existed.

28:26.527 --> 28:29.360
You two get off, l'll finish up here.

28:34.007 --> 28:35.679
No, no, no way!

28:35.727 --> 28:38.958
Look, she's going to clear
the whole lot! Tab gone!

28:39.007 --> 28:41.601
350 smackers, vanished!

28:41.647 --> 28:42.921
For sex with you?

28:42.967 --> 28:45.481
Shut up!

28:45.527 --> 28:49.315
What about Sheila? You can't
fucking shag someone for money!

28:49.367 --> 28:51.483
That's scraping it, even by your standards.

28:51.527 --> 28:54.644
Hello? l need you to spring me!

28:54.687 --> 28:57.440
Look, l'll just, you know,

28:57.487 --> 29:01.719
feel her up a bit, get the motor
running and then, wham!

29:01.767 --> 29:03.678
''Kevus interruptus''!

29:05.887 --> 29:09.846
Oh, you owe me for this, Frank.
And we're talking big time.

29:20.207 --> 29:22.767
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

29:22.807 --> 29:24.877
Cassie!

29:24.927 --> 29:28.840
Why don't we take it nice and slowly?

29:28.887 --> 29:31.447
Sod that, l want you in me!

29:35.207 --> 29:38.085
l want you! Oh, l want you now!

29:38.127 --> 29:42.325
Now!

29:42.367 --> 29:44.278
Suck them!

29:46.327 --> 29:48.238
You want me to suck your tits?

29:48.287 --> 29:52.599
l want you to bite me! Treat me rough!
l want you to spit on me!

29:52.647 --> 29:55.161
Oh!

29:55.207 --> 29:58.119
- Cassie, l can't do this.
- You can!

29:58.167 --> 30:01.523
lt's not, l don't want to,
l would love to, l think...

30:01.567 --> 30:03.478
Playing hard to get, Frank?

30:03.527 --> 30:05.119
We'll see about that.

30:05.167 --> 30:07.806
No, no, wait!

30:08.847 --> 30:12.123
Oh!

30:12.167 --> 30:13.486
Oh!

30:13.527 --> 30:15.006
Oof!

30:17.607 --> 30:18.357
What the... !

30:18.407 --> 30:19.601
What are the chances of that?

30:19.647 --> 30:21.922
Come back here, you bastards!

30:21.967 --> 30:24.800
Two lads, druggies, l just seen them
running off towards the park.

30:24.847 --> 30:27.884
Right, l'm calling the police!

30:32.567 --> 30:34.285
A big help you were!

30:34.327 --> 30:35.840
You got out of it, didn't you?

30:35.887 --> 30:38.799
Fucking come here!

30:38.847 --> 30:40.519
She was all over you!

30:40.567 --> 30:43.684
You can't keep that out of other
people's business, can you?

30:43.727 --> 30:46.685
We had a plan until
you came along and fucked it up!

30:46.727 --> 30:49.924
Frank! She was sucking you off!

30:49.967 --> 30:52.197
l wouldn't say sucking.

30:52.247 --> 30:55.159
- D'you know your problem, Frank?
- What?

30:55.207 --> 30:59.485
You never think about anyone but
yourself! Never take responsibility!

30:59.527 --> 31:02.758
- You're like a pathetic little kid!
- Takes one to know one!

31:03.767 --> 31:07.442
Touch her again and l'll ruin your life.

31:07.487 --> 31:08.283
Yeah.

31:08.327 --> 31:10.966
Oh, l mean it, Frank. Me mum,

31:11.007 --> 31:15.205
the house, the kids...

31:15.247 --> 31:17.966
you'll lose the lot!

31:33.287 --> 31:35.642
What's up with you?

31:37.887 --> 31:40.082
lt's the twins.

31:40.127 --> 31:42.083
The twins.

31:42.127 --> 31:46.040
What? What's wrong with them?

31:46.087 --> 31:47.645
Here we go.

31:47.687 --> 31:50.076
Christ, they're evil! They're evil!

31:50.127 --> 31:55.804
SQUEALlNG AND SCREAMlNG

32:08.367 --> 32:12.201
Don't touch me. Don't touch me, please!

32:20.847 --> 32:23.156
Who'd have kids?

32:48.927 --> 32:52.397
Hey. Should have woken me.

32:54.447 --> 32:57.200
You OK?

32:58.247 --> 33:03.241
l've got to get the kids ready for school
and then off to work, so...

33:03.287 --> 33:07.917
Should l use the door, or should l
disappear in a puff of smoke?

33:13.327 --> 33:16.717
Here's your dinner money.
That's for your trip.

33:19.127 --> 33:21.482
All right? ls your lan in?

33:23.247 --> 33:25.807

33:25.847 --> 33:28.407
Mum thinks everyone should meet.

33:28.447 --> 33:31.439
See you later, sweetheart.

33:34.487 --> 33:36.045
l've asked her to marry me.

33:37.767 --> 33:40.486
Does that mean we'll be related?

33:42.047 --> 33:43.765
Speak for yourself.

33:44.807 --> 33:47.367
Oi! Are you right in the head?

33:49.727 --> 33:51.365
l had no option.

33:51.407 --> 33:55.241
What are you on about?
You can't marry, you're fucking gay!

33:56.607 --> 34:00.759
Went round to talk to her parents.
l were going to tell them the truth.

34:00.807 --> 34:04.117
About everything.
But the words wouldn't come out.

34:04.167 --> 34:07.876
They thought l were nervous
so they started talking for me.

34:07.927 --> 34:12.364
Before l knew, l were getting engaged!
They've given us a bleeding ring!

34:13.407 --> 34:15.556
You can't do it, lan.

34:18.127 --> 34:20.800
l've no fucking choice!

34:40.246 --> 34:41.918
What do you want?

34:41.967 --> 34:45.039
Engagement party? Why are you doing this?

34:45.087 --> 34:46.406
He's a better man than you.

34:46.447 --> 34:50.156
You're going to let him marry you?
Mandy, what do you want?

34:50.206 --> 34:52.163

Two families joined by love.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.280
You can't go through with this.

35:38.327 --> 35:43.685
lt's like Romeo and Juliet
'cept without the suicides.

35:43.727 --> 35:46.082
That Shakespeare
was no comedy writer, was he?

35:46.127 --> 35:48.038
Let the celebrations commence.

35:48.087 --> 35:49.440
Yay!

35:49.487 --> 35:53.560
Come on.

35:53.607 --> 35:56.121
Room for a little'un?

35:56.167 --> 35:59.045
Yeah, if you don't mind the boot.

35:59.087 --> 36:01.681
Don't do this to yourself.

36:03.287 --> 36:05.755
l've changed my mind.

36:11.567 --> 36:14.035

Well, this is what happens

37:14.087 --> 37:16.317

37:20.887 --> 37:23.526
Everybody, can l have your attention, please?

37:23.567 --> 37:26.206
Pray silence
for the master of ceremonies.

37:26.247 --> 37:31.844
As the old saying goes,
we're not so much losing a daughter

37:31.887 --> 37:36.119
as gaining a son
and we want our Mandy to be happy.

37:36.167 --> 37:38.203

gonna make her happy.

37:38.247 --> 37:41.876

38:08.407 --> 38:10.398

38:11.647 --> 38:14.957
Call it off, the whole thing's a joke.

38:15.007 --> 38:17.202
Donny, get him out of here.

38:23.087 --> 38:24.918
The baby's mine.

38:27.287 --> 38:29.562

38:30.447 --> 38:33.086
l should have told you, lan.

38:37.247 --> 38:39.522
You bastard!

38:55.327 --> 38:57.795
Tell me you're lying.

39:03.047 --> 39:05.607
Tell me you're lying.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.326
Get your hands off him!

39:10.367 --> 39:12.642
Your baby brother, eh?

39:12.687 --> 39:15.440

39:29.047 --> 39:32.323
Oh, you don't scare me, love.

39:39.247 --> 39:43.126
Look at the state of him.
You're a bleedin' animal.

39:46.567 --> 39:48.558
l'm so sorry.

39:49.527 --> 39:52.246
l'm really sorry.

39:56.727 --> 40:01.642
(SCREAMS) They've got the baby!
They've got the baby!

40:01.687 --> 40:04.281

40:07.167 --> 40:09.158

40:11.047 --> 40:14.483
You wanker! You're barred!

40:16.087 --> 40:17.998
Gallaghers.

40:18.847 --> 40:20.997
Nothing but scum.

40:22.407 --> 40:25.319
Stay the fuck away from this baby.

40:25.367 --> 40:28.803
lt's got nothing to do
with you cunts any more.

40:35.207 --> 40:35.878
Scum.

40:35.927 --> 40:38.760
Come on, everybody. Get a drink.
Don't waste all this drink.

40:38.807 --> 40:41.605
Come on, we're the fucking lrish!

40:47.487 --> 40:48.317
(Mr Maguire) Fuck all of youse!

40:48.367 --> 40:50.961
Welcome back.

41:08.607 --> 41:10.006
Thanks.

41:12.607 --> 41:14.518
Did they hurt you?

41:14.567 --> 41:17.525
Yeah, right.

41:17.567 --> 41:19.603
Felt like an effeminate chimp.

41:21.487 --> 41:24.923
l couldn't let you go through with it, lan.

41:25.967 --> 41:30.199
You were gonna chuck your life away
because of my mistake.

41:32.567 --> 41:34.797
You've made yourself the villain.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.079
They're gonna hate you for it.

41:38.127 --> 41:41.164
Yeah, well that's something
we'll just have to live with.

41:50.847 --> 41:52.963
Don't worry. l'm not staying.

41:53.007 --> 41:56.238
You should be ashamed of yourself.

42:32.727 --> 42:34.365
l need a favour.

42:36.887 --> 42:38.286
Don't hate Lip.

42:38.327 --> 42:42.081
You can't hate him
because l knew all along.

42:42.127 --> 42:44.436
About him and Mandy.

42:44.487 --> 42:47.320
And what about the baby?

42:47.367 --> 42:50.165
There was no way it could be mine.

42:50.207 --> 42:53.040
And yet you were gonna go along with it?

42:53.087 --> 42:55.681
The engagement, the wedding?

43:14.447 --> 43:17.166
Mandy were my cover.
We never even done it.

43:19.487 --> 43:21.364
Don't tell anyone.

43:21.407 --> 43:25.241
Please, Fiona. Don't tell anyone.

43:58.887 --> 44:02.800
Look, it wasn't you, OK?
l just can't get into all that again.

44:02.847 --> 44:04.075
All that?

44:09.367 --> 44:11.119
He broke your heart, yeah?

44:11.167 --> 44:13.522
You used to love him.

44:13.567 --> 44:15.717
That guy. ln the picture.

44:18.327 --> 44:20.079
l'm sorry.

44:22.927 --> 44:24.883
l was just lonely.

44:31.007 --> 44:33.202
l hardly even know you.

44:34.767 --> 44:36.837
Ain't that the point?

44:39.807 --> 44:42.640
l never imagined
l'd have a kid at this age.

44:42.687 --> 44:44.518
That's what all the fuck-ups do.

44:44.567 --> 44:48.003
Shag some bird and then piss off
and leave someone else to bring it up.

44:48.047 --> 44:50.720
CSA chasing 'em for money.

44:51.207 --> 44:53.084
Except now l am the fuck-up.

44:57.487 --> 45:00.399
She were a good jump, though.

45:00.447 --> 45:02.961
See you two have kissed and made up.

45:03.007 --> 45:05.157
Look who's found her marbles.

45:06.327 --> 45:09.842
The doctors said l should never
have come off of the Seroxin.

45:09.887 --> 45:13.163
Oh, what's the matter, baby?

45:13.207 --> 45:14.959
Were you missing your daddy?

45:15.007 --> 45:16.804
Oh.

45:16.847 --> 45:18.758
Give it him. Be good practice.

45:18.807 --> 45:21.924
Hey, who fancies a beer?
Courtesy of Sheila.

45:21.967 --> 45:26.404
They broke the mould after you, love.
Keep taking the tablets.

45:26.447 --> 45:29.245
Hello, Carol.

45:29.287 --> 45:31.243
Sheila!

45:31.287 --> 45:32.959
Sheila!

45:34.887 --> 45:39.039
A long time ago we used to be friends

45:39.087 --> 45:43.365
But l haven't thought of you lately at all

45:43.407 --> 45:47.605
lf ever again a greeting is sent...

45:47.647 --> 45:49.399
(Carl) 'Being a human's rubbish.

45:49.447 --> 45:52.041
'Especially in this house.
lf it comes to a toss up

45:52.087 --> 45:56.558
'between the people and dogs,
give me a wet nose every time.'

46:02.327 --> 46:03.476
You're not my dad.

46:03.527 --> 46:05.324
Of course l'm your fucking dad.

46:05.367 --> 46:09.280
Fiona had sexual intercourse
with Joey Dawson.

46:10.447 --> 46:11.277
Gary Bennett.

46:13.527 --> 46:14.642
Fucker.

46:14.687 --> 46:17.997
What d'you think, eh? Mr and Mrs Dawson.

46:20.287 --> 46:22.118
Argh!

47:03.007 --> 47:05.760
(All) One, two, three, cheeeeeese!

47:05.807 --> 47:07.638
Er, wrong family!

47:09.727 --> 47:13.242
So long, farewell,
auf wiedersehen, adieu!

47:13.287 --> 47:16.962
Adieu, adieu,
to you and you and you

47:24.447 --> 47:28.645
So long, farewell,
au revoir, auf wiedersehen

47:28.687 --> 47:31.599
