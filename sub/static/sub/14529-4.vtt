00:06.007 --> 00:11.343
(narrator) Previously on "The
Making of the Mob: New York"...

00:11.345 --> 00:13.078
All right,
this is how it's gonna work.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.646
(narrator)
Charles "Lucky" Luciano

00:14.648 --> 00:17.683
takes control
of the New York Mafia...

00:21.389 --> 00:23.255
and with his crew--

00:23.257 --> 00:26.225
Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel,

00:26.227 --> 00:29.495
Frank Costello
and Vito Genovese...

00:29.497 --> 00:31.397
Easy, Joe, easy.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.198
(narrator)
...Luciano establishes

00:33.200 --> 00:35.334
a powerful commission
of five families

00:35.336 --> 00:38.037
to rule the underworld...

00:38.039 --> 00:39.338
The five New York families.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.240
They will have the final say
in all matters,

00:41.242 --> 00:43.175
even life and death.

00:43.177 --> 00:46.211
(narrator) ...enlisting notorious
hit squad Murder, Inc.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.313
to enforce its power.

00:48.315 --> 00:50.549
(Luciano)
You guys'll be like ghosts.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.351
Nothing gets left behind.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.352
Nothing.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.753
(man grunts)

00:56.757 --> 01:01.560
¶¶

01:01.562 --> 01:04.730
(narrator) But a threat
to Luciano's organization

01:04.732 --> 01:06.532
emerges from within...

01:06.534 --> 01:08.400
Get another bottle of vino
over here for the ladies.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.403
(narrator) ...as rogue
gangster Dutch Schultz...

01:11.405 --> 01:13.172
(gunshot, people scream)

01:13.174 --> 01:15.174
...plans to assassinate the man

01:15.176 --> 01:17.109
on a mission
to take down the Mob,

01:17.111 --> 01:19.244
New York prosecutor
Thomas Dewey.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.613
I don't care
how much it costs.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.583
Get me Dutch Schultz!

01:24.585 --> 01:29.588
(narrator) Dewey launches a crusade
against organized crime...

01:29.590 --> 01:31.590
and to save the Mafia,

01:31.592 --> 01:36.829
the New York kingpin
orders a hit...

01:36.831 --> 01:40.099
on one of his own.

01:40.101 --> 01:42.234
(gun cocking)

01:45.139 --> 01:49.141
¶¶

01:49.143 --> 01:52.177
(man)
¶ This ain't no time ¶

01:52.179 --> 01:56.181
¶ To feel sorry
for myself ¶

01:56.183 --> 01:59.418
¶ I can't help it ¶

01:59.420 --> 02:03.155
¶ 'Cause there's nobody else ¶

02:03.157 --> 02:05.691
¶ And I walk these streets ¶

02:05.693 --> 02:10.162
¶ With your name on my tongue ¶

02:10.164 --> 02:12.898
¶ But I dare not speak ¶

02:12.900 --> 02:15.334
¶ Only there it belongs ¶

02:16.804 --> 02:22.374
¶ There's got to be
a better way ¶

02:22.376 --> 02:24.209
¶ Better way ¶¶

02:24.211 --> 02:25.878
(gunshot echoes)

02:35.923 --> 02:40.692
(man groaning and gasping)

03:06.520 --> 03:09.221
(narrator) In a single
move, the New York Mafia

03:09.223 --> 03:11.924
has eliminated the greatest
threat to its power:

03:11.926 --> 03:15.627
uncontrollable gangster
Dutch Schultz.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.332
(men laughing)

03:20.334 --> 03:24.203
(all talking, clinking glasses)

03:24.205 --> 03:26.338
(narrator) With Schultz
out of the picture,

03:26.340 --> 03:28.440
the Mob is back in business.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.309
He doesn't have anything in--
that's all natural.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.978
It's all natural--
I'm Sicilian, come on.

03:32.980 --> 03:38.550
(narrator) Charles "Lucky" Luciano,
Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel,

03:38.552 --> 03:43.388
Frank Costello and Vito Genovese
are living the high life.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.324
(Vincent Pastore)
Guys like Lucky

03:45.326 --> 03:47.960
came up from the bottom,

03:47.962 --> 03:51.263
clawed their way up,
and wind up being on top,

03:51.265 --> 03:54.266
and when they became the boss,

03:54.268 --> 03:58.437
it was almost like their
"Man of La Mancha" dream.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.638
This is what they wanted.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.774
¶¶

04:02.776 --> 04:03.775
All right? Drink up.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.244
<i>A salute!</i>

04:05.246 --> 04:06.745
(men) <i> Salute!</i> God bless.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.748
¶¶

04:09.750 --> 04:11.883
(Chazz Palminteri)
In my neighborhood growing up,

04:11.885 --> 04:13.418
we didn't have money,

04:13.420 --> 04:14.953
and now all of a sudden
you see these guys,

04:14.955 --> 04:18.991
they have a diamond pinkie ring,
gorgeous suits,

04:18.993 --> 04:20.626
beautiful women with them.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.427
They<i> were</i> gods to us.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.297
(narrator)
By 1935,

04:25.299 --> 04:28.300
Luciano and his crew
had built an empire

04:28.302 --> 04:30.302
pulling in
the modern-day equivalent

04:30.304 --> 04:33.472
of over $100 million a year.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.008
¶¶

04:36.010 --> 04:39.311
Meyer Lansky
is leading the charge,

04:39.313 --> 04:41.713
revolutionizing
their gambling rackets,

04:41.715 --> 04:43.782
turning their low-rent
gambling dens

04:43.784 --> 04:47.819
into high-class establishments.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.289
(Rich Cohen)
Well, Lansky saw opportunities

04:50.291 --> 04:52.858
where other people saw nothing,
and he saw treasure

04:52.860 --> 04:55.327
where other people saw trash.

04:55.329 --> 05:00.065
He was the first guy to take
craps, which was a street game,

05:00.067 --> 05:03.335
and put it up
on green felt on a table

05:03.337 --> 05:06.405
and thereby make it
respectable and fancy.

05:06.407 --> 05:10.342
(narrator) As Lansky is inventing
the first modern casinos...

05:10.344 --> 05:12.377
Look, I want all these
collected today!

05:12.379 --> 05:13.912
Collected today.

05:13.914 --> 05:17.349
(narrator) ...Vito Genovese
has a heroin racket

05:17.351 --> 05:19.851
that's pulling in
millions of dollars a year,

05:19.853 --> 05:21.787
but he decides to diversify,

05:21.789 --> 05:24.690
and begins running
high-stakes poker games...

05:24.692 --> 05:28.593
Three of a kind.

05:28.595 --> 05:32.097
(narrator) ...luring in
unsuspecting wealthy businessmen

05:32.099 --> 05:36.601
and fixing the outcome
to make sure he always wins.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.641
Full house.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.943
Jacks over nine.

05:47.081 --> 05:50.849
Gambling was the strength
of the American Mafia.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.119
The reason gambling
was appealing to Mob guys

05:54.121 --> 05:56.088
was because their life
was a gamble,

05:56.090 --> 05:59.658
and it was only a reflection
of the way they lived.

05:59.660 --> 06:03.829
¶¶

06:05.866 --> 06:08.433
(narrator)
While business is booming,

06:08.435 --> 06:12.371
Bugsy Siegel makes sure
the money is collected...

06:13.941 --> 06:16.975
and that the Mob's authority
is understood.

06:18.679 --> 06:22.414
And as part of the Mob's
hit squad, Murder, Inc.,

06:22.416 --> 06:27.018
Siegel carries out orders
sent down by the Commission.

06:27.020 --> 06:31.757
¶¶

06:36.530 --> 06:39.765
Frank Costello keeps
the authorities at bay,

06:39.767 --> 06:41.400
using his connections

06:41.402 --> 06:43.635
with corrupt politicians
and law enforcement

06:43.637 --> 06:48.106
to ensure the Mob's business
runs smoothly.

06:48.108 --> 06:51.109
Now that they were running
these criminal organizations,

06:51.111 --> 06:52.744
very profitable ones,

06:52.746 --> 06:55.480
they had to pay off
police and politicians

06:55.482 --> 06:56.915
to continue thriving,

06:56.917 --> 07:00.118
because they didn't want
any outside interference,

07:00.120 --> 07:01.920
you didn't want to be arrested.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.522
(Rudy Giuliani)
"The Godfather"

07:03.524 --> 07:05.490
was based on Frank Costello

07:05.492 --> 07:09.694
with all the judges and all
the politicians in his pocket.

07:09.696 --> 07:14.466
(narrator) At the top of the operation
is 38-year-old Lucky Luciano.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.502
(Selwyn Raab) The best way
to describe Lucky Luciano

07:17.504 --> 07:20.472
was that he was
a creative genius,

07:20.474 --> 07:22.140
but a criminal creative genius.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.743
He knew entrepreneurship.

07:24.745 --> 07:27.712
He knew how organizations
should function

07:27.714 --> 07:32.083
and how to get rid
of rivalries and competition.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.820
In effect,
he was an early equivalent,

07:34.822 --> 07:36.788
a criminal equivalent,

07:36.790 --> 07:41.560
of a Warren Buffett
or a Steve Jobs.

07:41.562 --> 07:44.196
¶¶

07:49.937 --> 07:54.039
(orchestra playing,
people talking and laughing)

08:05.752 --> 08:08.920
(applause)

08:14.094 --> 08:15.260
Hey.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.229
Where are you going?

08:18.165 --> 08:20.165
None of your business.

08:21.768 --> 08:23.502
You know who I am?

08:23.504 --> 08:24.636
(scoffs)

08:24.638 --> 08:27.939
Everybody knows who you are.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.876
Am I supposed to be
impressed?

08:31.845 --> 08:33.745
Hey.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.580
You haven't given me
the chance yet.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.656
(Frank Vincent)
Well, goodfellas are sexy guys.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.625
They got money, they got power,

08:46.627 --> 08:49.895
they have, uh, new cars,
they have the best clothes,

08:49.897 --> 08:52.864
and they're notorious
and they're bad boys.

08:52.866 --> 08:56.568
I think certain women
are attracted to that.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.003
He's mesmerized
over here, huh?

08:58.005 --> 08:59.004
(chuckles)

08:59.006 --> 09:03.608
¶¶

09:03.610 --> 09:07.746
And soon... soon we can
go traveling together.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.115
Go to Paris,
take you shopping.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.017
You like that?

09:12.019 --> 09:15.787
(Rich Cohen) Lucky Luciano
lived in the Waldorf-Astoria.

09:15.789 --> 09:19.157
Normal people with normal lives
don't live in fancy hotels.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.293
That's for
rock stars and gangsters.

09:21.295 --> 09:24.863
(narrator) From his residential
suite at the Waldorf-Astoria,

09:24.865 --> 09:29.067
Luciano begins to build a life
with his new girlfriend,

09:29.069 --> 09:32.804
a 20-year-old Broadway dancer
named Gay Orlova.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.806
(man) Luciano's
relationship with women

09:34.808 --> 09:39.210
was similar to the relationship
of a lot of these guys.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.047
One-night stands.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.949
Occasionally you met someone.

09:43.951 --> 09:49.354
He had a longer relationship
with a woman named Gay Orlova.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.891
Well, she was an entertainer,
she was fancy.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.327
I'm gonna take care of you,
you understand?

09:55.329 --> 09:57.829
No matter what happens to me,
you'll be taken care of.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.998
Do you understand?

10:02.936 --> 10:07.939
(horns honking)

10:07.941 --> 10:09.941
¶¶

10:09.943 --> 10:11.309
(people talking and laughing)

10:11.311 --> 10:13.345
(narrator)
While his girlfriend's at home,

10:13.347 --> 10:16.681
Luciano looks
to diversify his business

10:16.683 --> 10:20.619
into the seedier side
of the underworld.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.989
¶¶

10:36.937 --> 10:40.038
¶¶

10:49.883 --> 10:53.151
All right, fellas, well,
it's pretty self-explanatory.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.220
As you see,
the man in the middle...

10:59.393 --> 11:02.227
What do you have on Luciano?

11:02.229 --> 11:04.029
(narrator)
For years, Luciano

11:04.031 --> 11:06.197
has been New York special
prosecutor Thomas Dewey's

11:06.199 --> 11:07.799
number-one target...

11:07.801 --> 11:11.836
but Luciano's rackets
are so well-organized,

11:11.838 --> 11:15.073
pinning a crime on him
will be nearly impossible.

11:18.045 --> 11:22.080
(Rudolph Giuliani) Well, being a
prosecutor, you come up in a tradition

11:22.082 --> 11:24.349
in which you're here
to do the right thing.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.950
You're constantly reminded

11:25.952 --> 11:29.421
that the correct result
in America is justice

11:29.423 --> 11:33.758
and the government wins
when we achieve justice.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.127
(narrator)
But what Dewey doesn't know

11:36.129 --> 11:40.398
is Luciano is about to play
right into his hands.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.268
¶¶

11:47.240 --> 11:49.240
¶¶

11:49.242 --> 11:51.076
(narrator)
At the height of his power,

11:51.078 --> 11:54.212
Lucky Luciano is determined
to expand his criminal operation

11:54.214 --> 11:58.983
and take advantage of the oldest
profession in the world...

11:58.985 --> 12:01.486
prostitution.

12:01.488 --> 12:06.357
In the 1930s, prostitution is
illegal in the United States,

12:06.359 --> 12:11.062
but Luciano knows underground
brothels are still thriving...

12:11.064 --> 12:14.766
and he wants
a cut of their profits.

12:14.768 --> 12:18.169
Luciano realized
that crime could cash in

12:18.171 --> 12:19.871
on free enterprise.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.272
That was what he was gonna do.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.841
They weren't gonna
limit themselves

12:22.843 --> 12:25.877
to one or two occupations

12:25.879 --> 12:29.047
like Prohibition or gambling
or loan-sharking.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.882
They would do everything.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.917
(narrator)
Like all of his other rackets,

12:32.919 --> 12:36.054
Luciano streamlines
the prostitution business.

12:36.056 --> 12:39.257
He has madams
to oversee the customers

12:39.259 --> 12:44.095
and bookers to bring prostitutes
to his brothels around the city.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.397
Prostitution was
a socially accepted thing

12:46.399 --> 12:49.033
on high levels of government,

12:49.035 --> 12:51.836
where politicians
would go into the houses

12:51.838 --> 12:55.240
in the company
of their gangster friends

12:55.242 --> 13:00.145
and spend a couple of hours
and just slip out the back door.

13:00.147 --> 13:04.315
(narrator) Soon, the criminal
kingpin has a citywide network

13:04.317 --> 13:09.120
of up to 200 brothels
and 1200 prostitutes.

13:09.122 --> 13:12.857
Lucky Luciano has created
a prostitution empire

13:12.859 --> 13:14.959
that will bring in
$12 million a year,

13:14.961 --> 13:19.998
the modern-day equivalent
of over 200 million.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.803
¶¶

13:46.393 --> 13:48.092
Well, I don't like it.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.360
It's a dirty business.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.562
It's a business.

13:50.564 --> 13:55.934
Look, these girls,
they get sick,

13:55.936 --> 13:59.070
they get diseases,
they get pregnant,

13:59.072 --> 14:00.471
they need doctors.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.142
That's trouble.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.844
It's a dirty business.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.111
And we're
in a dirty business.

14:07.113 --> 14:09.013
Charlie, let me ask you this.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.281
Are you all right
being connected

14:10.283 --> 14:12.383
to hundreds
of drug-addicted girls

14:12.385 --> 14:15.620
who will turn on you in a second
for another hit of heroin?

14:15.622 --> 14:17.155
Are you okay
with an army of pimps

14:17.157 --> 14:20.491
who are loyal
only to themselves?

14:20.493 --> 14:24.295
Are you okay risking
everything we've built...

14:24.297 --> 14:27.999
for this?

14:28.001 --> 14:29.567
Let's move.

14:29.569 --> 14:32.237
(narrator)
For Luciano, Meyer Lansky

14:32.239 --> 14:37.075
has been a trusted friend and
business partner for decades...

14:37.077 --> 14:41.246
and while he's always trusted
Lansky's advice...

14:41.248 --> 14:46.951
this time Luciano
ignores his friend's warning.

14:46.953 --> 14:51.356
¶¶

14:53.593 --> 14:57.962
(church bell ringing)

14:57.964 --> 15:01.466
It's too long.
I can't.

15:01.468 --> 15:04.135
Come on,
take me to lunch.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.371
I wish I could.

15:06.373 --> 15:09.307
You don't have time for me?

15:09.309 --> 15:11.943
I'll always have
time for you.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.344
You're my girl.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.246
(narrator)
Within months,

15:15.248 --> 15:18.349
Luciano begins leading
a double life,

15:18.351 --> 15:20.551
spending days
with his girlfriend

15:20.553 --> 15:22.320
and nights at his brothels.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.455
(Drea de Matteo)
Lucky Luciano, he had a woman

15:24.457 --> 15:27.025
that was like his main woman,
his main squeeze.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.359
He adored her.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.495
But he cheated on her.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.197
It's a power thing,
yeah, I think...

15:33.199 --> 15:36.134
and then men are also just pigs.

15:36.136 --> 15:41.472
(man on record) <i> ¶ Why am I
so happy</i> <i> I could cry? ¶</i>

15:41.474 --> 15:44.142
It's always great
to see you, Lucky.

15:44.144 --> 15:47.612
(narrator) Luciano begins frequenting
one of his own brothels,

15:47.614 --> 15:51.049
run by a madam named Cokey Flo.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.217
(Cokey Flo)
You happy with the merchandise?

15:55.021 --> 15:56.621
Very.

15:56.623 --> 16:00.024
(women giggling)

16:00.026 --> 16:01.592
Here.

16:01.594 --> 16:05.063
Anything you want...
it's yours.

16:07.367 --> 16:12.170
(man on record) <i> ¶ Why? 'Cause
I found you,</i> <i> that's why ¶¶</i>

16:12.172 --> 16:16.307
¶¶

16:16.309 --> 16:19.077
(Sal Polisi) I was involved with
prostitutes, working girls.

16:19.079 --> 16:22.613
There's something about them
that you have in common

16:22.615 --> 16:25.049
which you don't have in common
with your wife.

16:25.051 --> 16:27.018
They're con artists.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.519
They're movers, they're shakers.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.689
They're criminals also,
so you feel at ease with them.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.158
You could spend a night
with a prostitute

16:34.160 --> 16:35.426
and let her know more
about your life

16:35.428 --> 16:37.195
than you want your wife to know.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.530
¶¶

16:51.077 --> 16:55.446
(narrator) As Thomas Dewey
builds his case against Luciano,

16:55.448 --> 17:01.319
he brings in an ambitious young
prosecutor named Eunice Carter.

17:01.321 --> 17:04.355
(Ellen Poulsen) Eunice Carter was
an assistant district attorney

17:04.357 --> 17:07.191
and the very first
African-American woman

17:07.193 --> 17:10.762
to serve in that capacity
in New York City.

17:10.764 --> 17:13.564
(narrator) Carter soon discovers
the break in the case

17:13.566 --> 17:17.201
Dewey has been looking for.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.604
More than half
the prostitutes arrested

17:19.606 --> 17:23.808
had the same bail bondsman
and the same attorney.

17:23.810 --> 17:27.211
They're all working together.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.781
What I need is how Luciano
is connected to these people.

17:29.783 --> 17:33.384
It's not a coincidence.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.053
(narrator)
Dewey and Carter discover

17:35.055 --> 17:37.422
that the man bailing out
the prostitutes

17:37.424 --> 17:41.426
is a known criminal
with ties to the Mob.

17:45.532 --> 17:50.234
This booker, Ralph.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.669
Get him in here.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.072
On what charge?

17:54.074 --> 17:56.407
Littering, jaywalking,
I don't care.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.810
Bring him in.

17:58.812 --> 18:00.411
(narrator)
Thomas Dewey believes

18:00.413 --> 18:03.147
he's found the weak link
in Luciano's operation.

18:03.149 --> 18:07.418
Now he just has to
make the booker talk.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.853
"What charge?"

18:12.425 --> 18:17.462
¶¶

18:17.464 --> 18:21.165
(narrator) Special prosecutor Thomas
Dewey has finally caught a break

18:21.167 --> 18:23.701
in his case
against Lucky Luciano

18:23.703 --> 18:27.738
and brings in a booker tied
to Luciano's prostitution ring.

18:27.740 --> 18:31.409
Now Dewey just has to
get him to talk.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.578
So, Ralph, I'm wondering
what you know

18:33.580 --> 18:36.547
about Lucky Luciano's
prostitution ring.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.316
Who?

18:38.318 --> 18:41.486
Sometimes he's known
as Charles Luciano.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.520
Ringing any bells?

18:42.522 --> 18:43.654
Never seen him before.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.323
Never?

18:45.325 --> 18:50.261
I have a lot of evidence
showing the contrary.

18:50.263 --> 18:53.397
Are you sure that's the answer
you want to give me?

18:57.303 --> 18:59.337
I've never seen the guy before.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.139
That's real cute, Ralph...

19:02.342 --> 19:05.476
but I'm almost
out of patience here.

19:05.478 --> 19:09.480
What do you know
about Lucky Luciano?

19:09.482 --> 19:11.582
If you were a rat, you were...

19:11.584 --> 19:15.419
you couldn't be tolerated
in any way, shape or form.

19:15.421 --> 19:17.355
I mean, they would kill you
for that.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.723
That's their unwritten law.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.726
You and I have
nothing more to talk about.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.227
(slaps Ralph's shoulder hard)

19:23.229 --> 19:26.497
¶¶

19:33.273 --> 19:35.306
(truck horn honking)

19:35.308 --> 19:37.808
(Lansky)
You've gotta be careful.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.411
Dewey's coming for you
and he's got the Mayor

19:40.413 --> 19:42.313
and half the City Council
behind him.

19:42.315 --> 19:47.385
Well, then it's a good thing
we got the other half.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.921
You can't buy Dewey.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.856
Okay?
He's not like the others.

19:51.858 --> 19:55.293
Meyer,
everybody's got a price.

20:03.436 --> 20:07.438
(narrator) Dewey lets the booker
walk, but he has a plan...

20:07.440 --> 20:10.841
as assistant district attorney
Eunice Carter

20:10.843 --> 20:14.545
has introduced a new
crime-fighting technology.

20:23.423 --> 20:27.625
(Ralph) I have two shifts tonight,
sometimes, um, six to 12 girls.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.827
It all depends.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.629
(on recording)
<i>Sometimes more, sometimes less.</i>

20:31.631 --> 20:33.497
(woman)<i> Ralph...</i>
<i> Hold on one second.</i>

20:33.499 --> 20:34.899
<i> Beat it!</i>

20:34.901 --> 20:36.467
<i> Yeah.</i>

20:36.469 --> 20:37.902
(Thomas Dewey III)
The use of wiretaps

20:37.904 --> 20:40.871
was very much of an innovation
at the time.

20:40.873 --> 20:44.442
Um, no need for a court order.

20:44.444 --> 20:49.480
Um, it's really become one of
the staples of law enforcement.

20:49.482 --> 20:53.017
(narrator) Dewey's investigators listen
to hundreds of hours of calls...

20:53.019 --> 20:55.386
(Ralph) <i> Nothing at all-- I'm
just</i> <i> trying to enjoy my cigar.</i>

20:55.388 --> 20:56.921
...waiting to hear evidence
against Luciano.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.357
Uh, about one every hour.
Hey, Ralph.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.925
(man)
<i> Your numbers are off, damn it.</i>

21:00.927 --> 21:03.594
(Ralph) <i> I did the books,</i> <i> so...
they're not off.</i>

21:03.596 --> 21:05.396
(man) <i> I'm looking at the
numbers,</i> <i> they're off.</i>

21:05.398 --> 21:07.331
(Ralph) <i> Listen, if
you're</i> <i> having trouble,</i>

21:07.333 --> 21:09.667
<i> you're gonna have to talk</i>
<i> to Lucky about it, all right?</i>

21:09.669 --> 21:11.902
¶¶

21:14.907 --> 21:18.509
<i> Well, you talk to Lucky</i>
<i> and then you get back with me.</i>

21:18.511 --> 21:20.711
<i> All right?</i>

21:22.482 --> 21:25.549
Always busting my balls.

21:25.551 --> 21:29.520
(horns honking)

21:29.522 --> 21:32.556
¶¶

21:32.558 --> 21:34.325
What am I listening to?

21:34.327 --> 21:38.496
One of Luciano's bookers.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.933
(man)
<i> Your numbers are off, damn it.</i>

21:42.935 --> 21:45.036
(Ralph) <i> I did the books,</i> <i> so...
they're not off.</i>

21:45.038 --> 21:46.771
(man) <i> I'm looking at the
numbers,</i> <i> they're off.</i>

21:46.773 --> 21:48.739
(Ralph) <i> Listen, if
you're</i> <i> having trouble,</i>

21:48.741 --> 21:51.075
<i> you're gonna have to talk</i>
<i> to Lucky about it, all right?</i>

21:51.077 --> 21:53.477
<i> You talk to Lucky</i>
<i> and then you get back with me.</i>

21:57.917 --> 22:01.552
Find out
where Mr. Luciano is.

22:01.554 --> 22:04.455
¶¶

22:13.599 --> 22:17.835
So... why do they
call you Lucky anyway?

22:19.539 --> 22:22.340
You're not from around here,
are you?

22:22.342 --> 22:24.442
What makes you say that?

22:24.444 --> 22:25.609
Just a hunch.

22:25.611 --> 22:30.381
¶¶

22:35.755 --> 22:37.722
(raised voices, women screaming)

22:37.724 --> 22:39.690
Police!
This is a raid!

22:39.692 --> 22:42.660
Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait!

22:42.662 --> 22:44.729
Come on, let's move!
Come on, everybody out!

22:44.731 --> 22:46.664
Let's go, let's go!
Move it!

22:46.666 --> 22:48.666
(voices overlapping)

22:48.668 --> 22:50.901
Everybody out!
Time's up! Let's go!

22:50.903 --> 22:54.772
¶¶

22:54.774 --> 22:58.008
(narrator) Thomas Dewey
organizes a citywide raid

22:58.010 --> 23:00.778
to find Lucky Luciano.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.413
He's not in here.

23:02.415 --> 23:03.948
¶¶

23:12.992 --> 23:14.892
(narrator)
Luciano escapes,

23:14.894 --> 23:18.062
but for Dewey, the raid isn't
a total loss,

23:18.064 --> 23:19.864
as he brings in a prostitute

23:19.866 --> 23:23.033
who works
in one of Luciano's brothels.

23:24.637 --> 23:30.674
So, how do you know
Lucky Luciano?

23:35.448 --> 23:37.748
I don't.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.017
You're lying to me.

23:42.121 --> 23:45.623
You and me both know
I'm gonna be outta here...

23:45.625 --> 23:49.493
two hours... three, tops.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.599
Not this time.

24:00.773 --> 24:04.542
I have you on solicitation,
disorderly conduct,

24:04.544 --> 24:07.945
resisting arrest,
assaulting a police officer,

24:07.947 --> 24:12.149
public lewdness,
narcotics possession...

24:12.151 --> 24:15.886
and sodomy.

24:15.888 --> 24:20.458
Given your record, I'd say
you're looking at five to 10.

24:20.460 --> 24:23.594
Or you can walk...

24:23.596 --> 24:28.199
and I can expunge
your prior convictions.

24:28.201 --> 24:30.568
Just tell me
everything you know

24:30.570 --> 24:34.038
about Lucky Luciano.

24:36.843 --> 24:39.477
All right.

24:49.555 --> 24:51.121
¶¶

24:56.896 --> 24:58.128
(man)
He's gone.

25:00.132 --> 25:01.966
Find him...

25:01.968 --> 25:03.934
no matter what it takes.

25:07.206 --> 25:10.908
¶¶

25:10.910 --> 25:13.577
(narrator)
Special prosecutor Thomas Dewey

25:13.579 --> 25:17.548
is determined to find
Mafia kingpin Lucky Luciano.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.917
(man)
He's gone.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.819
Find him...

25:21.821 --> 25:23.988
no matter what it takes.

25:23.990 --> 25:27.725
(narrator) But Luciano is in the
last place Dewey would look...

25:27.727 --> 25:33.731
more than 1200 miles away,
in Hot Springs, Arkansas.

25:33.733 --> 25:39.603
(birds chirping)

25:39.605 --> 25:41.906
(Luciano) Hustle-bustle of the
city streets, the subway,

25:41.908 --> 25:43.774
who needs that, right?

25:43.776 --> 25:45.142
This is where it's at.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.710
You're safe here, right?

25:46.712 --> 25:48.812
Yeah.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.316
What about
the local police?

25:52.318 --> 25:54.051
You don't have to worry
about that here.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.219
No?

25:55.221 --> 25:57.555
No.

25:57.557 --> 26:00.824
(narrator) With one of the most
corrupt police forces in the country,

26:00.826 --> 26:03.827
Hot Springs is
the most sought-after hideout

26:03.829 --> 26:07.264
for gangsters on the run
from the law...

26:07.266 --> 26:11.936
a haven filled with casinos,
overrun with gamblers,

26:11.938 --> 26:15.005
and completely
under the control of the Mob.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.074
(Ellen Poulsen) When Lucky
landed in Hot Springs,

26:17.076 --> 26:19.944
it was controlled
by organized crime.

26:19.946 --> 26:24.048
Any gangster could check in
and enjoy the hospitality,

26:24.050 --> 26:25.783
as long
as that gangster promised

26:25.785 --> 26:30.688
not to bring his criminal
activities into the town.

26:30.690 --> 26:34.058
¶¶

26:34.060 --> 26:38.362
(narrator) Back in New York, Dewey
knows if he can't find Luciano,

26:38.364 --> 26:42.833
all the evidence he's collected
will mean nothing.

26:42.835 --> 26:46.170
With Luciano
nowhere to be found,

26:46.172 --> 26:49.940
Dewey expands
his citywide search

26:49.942 --> 26:54.712
into a nationwide manhunt.

26:54.714 --> 26:58.182
¶¶

26:59.719 --> 27:03.053
On April 3, 1936,

27:03.055 --> 27:06.757
Dewey's big break won't come
from effort or strategy,

27:06.759 --> 27:09.893
but from pure coincidence.

27:09.895 --> 27:14.164
¶¶

27:15.701 --> 27:16.934
Lucky!

27:16.936 --> 27:18.769
Yeah?

27:18.771 --> 27:19.937
Lucky Luciano.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.872
That's right.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.207
(narrator)
A New York detective

27:23.209 --> 27:24.908
working an unrelated case

27:24.910 --> 27:27.645
recognizes Luciano while passing
through Hot Springs.

27:27.647 --> 27:30.180
You're coming with me.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.082
Hands off me...
get your hands off me.

27:32.084 --> 27:34.051
(narrator)
After months on the run,

27:34.053 --> 27:35.853
the most powerful gangster
in America

27:35.855 --> 27:38.656
has finally been arrested.

27:38.658 --> 27:43.794
¶¶

27:50.903 --> 27:53.804
Hey, Sheriff,
let me make a phone call.

28:09.121 --> 28:12.423
(narrator) Luciano believes if he
can arrange his trial in Arkansas,

28:12.425 --> 28:16.026
he'll be able to bribe his way
out of Dewey's charges.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.729
(phone rings)

28:18.731 --> 28:19.730
Hello?

28:19.732 --> 28:21.198
Frank, what's going on?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.400
<i> Charlie, don't worry,</i>
<i> we're handling it.</i>

28:23.402 --> 28:25.402
We're pulling
every string that we can.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.971
Trust me, I'm on it--
we're calling in all the favors.

28:27.973 --> 28:29.807
All right.

28:29.809 --> 28:32.209
Just do whatever you have to do,
you understand?

28:34.313 --> 28:37.948
(Sal Polisi) The police department,
attorneys, they're all for sale.

28:37.950 --> 28:40.317
We had them all in our hand.

28:40.319 --> 28:41.952
Like "The Godfather," they said,

28:41.954 --> 28:43.253
"He had the politicians."

28:43.255 --> 28:44.755
We had them.

28:47.493 --> 28:50.160
(narrator)
Luciano's bribes pay off

28:50.162 --> 28:55.065
and the local sheriff personally
refuses Thomas Dewey's demand

28:55.067 --> 28:58.302
to deliver Luciano
back to New York.

28:58.304 --> 28:59.970
¶¶

28:59.972 --> 29:01.905
Dewey soon learns that Luciano

29:01.907 --> 29:05.342
is continuing
to run his rackets.

29:05.344 --> 29:12.049
Vito Genovese is making millions
dealing heroin...

29:12.051 --> 29:13.784
Meyer Lansky is overseeing

29:13.786 --> 29:16.987
the largest network of casinos
in the country...

29:16.989 --> 29:20.858
¶¶

29:20.860 --> 29:24.328
and Frank Costello is continuing
to use his connections

29:24.330 --> 29:27.464
to keep Luciano
out of Dewey's reach.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.366
¶¶

29:29.368 --> 29:32.936
From a jail cell in Arkansas...

29:32.938 --> 29:39.309
Lucky Luciano is still
in full control of his empire.

29:39.311 --> 29:42.312
¶¶

29:46.452 --> 29:48.252
(Thomas Dewey III)
If you have a situation

29:48.254 --> 29:50.921
where you have the level
of institutional corruption

29:50.923 --> 29:55.259
that you had in the late 1920s
and early 1930s,

29:55.261 --> 29:57.127
one of the things
that you need to do

29:57.129 --> 30:00.864
is to try to rally the public
behind your efforts.

30:00.866 --> 30:04.168
We are entirely prepared
to prosecute Lucky Luciano.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.170
The only problem
is that he has fled to Arkansas,

30:06.172 --> 30:07.871
where for some reason

30:07.873 --> 30:10.207
the authorities seem unwilling
to hand him over to us.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.176
Lucky Luciano,
to my knowledge...

30:12.178 --> 30:15.078
(narrator) To put pressure
on Arkansas state officials,

30:15.080 --> 30:19.983
Dewey takes his case
to the media...

30:19.985 --> 30:22.920
and while
still in police custody,

30:22.922 --> 30:27.057
Lucky Luciano is named
Public Enemy Number One.

30:27.059 --> 30:29.126
¶¶

30:32.464 --> 30:35.199
We are entirely prepared
to prosecute Lucky Luciano.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.434
The only problem
is that he has fled to Arkansas,

30:37.436 --> 30:39.136
where for some reason

30:39.138 --> 30:41.471
the authorities seem unwilling
to hand him over to us.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.874
Lucky Luciano,
to my knowledge...

30:43.876 --> 30:47.978
(narrator) With Lucky Luciano protected
by a corrupt Arkansas sheriff,

30:47.980 --> 30:51.915
Thomas Dewey goes to the press
and names the Mafia kingpin

30:51.917 --> 30:54.151
Public Enemy Number One.

30:54.153 --> 30:59.256
(Thomas Dewey III) The motivation for
calling Luciano Public Enemy Number One

30:59.258 --> 31:03.126
was to personalize
the corruption

31:03.128 --> 31:04.461
and the criminal conduct.

31:04.463 --> 31:07.464
Luciano is widely regarded

31:07.466 --> 31:11.034
as the most important racketeer
in the country,

31:11.036 --> 31:14.438
and this case involves one of
the most loathsome of crimes,

31:14.440 --> 31:18.108
exploiting the most vulnerable,
downtrodden women

31:18.110 --> 31:20.077
in our society.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.379
(Ellen Poulsen)
Thomas E. Dewey utilized

31:22.381 --> 31:26.950
a two-pronged approach to get
Luciano out of Hot Springs.

31:26.952 --> 31:30.888
In addition to putting pressure
on the police departments,

31:30.890 --> 31:33.223
he also got the press involved

31:33.225 --> 31:35.659
and accused Hot Springs

31:35.661 --> 31:39.963
of being afraid to release
Luciano into his custody.

31:39.965 --> 31:43.033
We intend to see
Lucky Luciano in prison

31:43.035 --> 31:45.369
for the longest possible
amount of time.

31:49.642 --> 31:51.308
(chuckles)

31:51.310 --> 31:53.343
I'm not afraid of Thomas Dewey.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.913
I'm just an American citizen
defending my rights.

31:55.915 --> 31:59.349
I happen to respect and think
Mr. Dewey's an intelligent man

31:59.351 --> 32:01.685
and a great prosecutor.

32:01.687 --> 32:06.990
This is about politics, the most
vicious kind of politics...

32:06.992 --> 32:08.659
(narrator)
To counter Dewey's attack,

32:08.661 --> 32:12.462
Luciano launches
his own press campaign.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.498
I might not be the most
moral man in this world,

32:14.500 --> 32:17.701
but I have never in my life
supported or participated

32:17.703 --> 32:19.636
in the practice of prostitution.

32:19.638 --> 32:22.940
And I have every confidence
that the authorities in Arkansas

32:22.942 --> 32:24.942
will uphold the law

32:24.944 --> 32:27.444
and send this man Luciano
to meet his fate

32:27.446 --> 32:30.380
in a court of law
here in New York City,

32:30.382 --> 32:32.149
where his crimes...

32:32.151 --> 32:35.152
(narrator) For days,
Luciano and Dewey wage war

32:35.154 --> 32:39.222
through press conferences
and national headlines.

32:39.224 --> 32:42.592
(Luciano) He can say whatever he wants
in the paper, but I tell you this.

32:42.594 --> 32:45.362
Any jury or judge
will see it my way,

32:45.364 --> 32:49.599
and this case will be dropped,
and I will be set free.

32:49.601 --> 32:54.304
(music playing on radio)

32:54.306 --> 32:55.639
(sheriff) Let's see if
my luck'll change a bit.

32:59.378 --> 33:01.078
Give me three.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.313
(narrator) With lawyers
fighting his extradition

33:03.315 --> 33:05.315
and the local sheriff
in his pocket,

33:05.317 --> 33:08.118
Luciano believes
it's only a matter of time

33:08.120 --> 33:09.553
before he's released.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.455
Full house.

33:11.457 --> 33:13.690
Hmm... can't beat that.

33:13.692 --> 33:18.462
¶¶

33:24.036 --> 33:26.136
Send Luciano out!

33:26.138 --> 33:30.207
¶¶

33:35.781 --> 33:38.281
(narrator) Dewey's press
campaign has paid off,

33:38.283 --> 33:41.084
and with public pressure
on state officials,

33:41.086 --> 33:43.353
the Arkansas governor
is forced to send a team

33:43.355 --> 33:47.157
of heavily armed state troopers
to Hot Springs.

33:47.159 --> 33:49.526
State troopers.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.595
¶¶

34:03.442 --> 34:06.810
¶¶

34:15.354 --> 34:17.754
(handcuffs clicking)

34:17.756 --> 34:23.360
(narrator) On April 4, 1936, the most
powerful gangster in the country

34:23.362 --> 34:26.196
is forced to surrender.

34:26.198 --> 34:29.766
¶¶

34:36.675 --> 34:39.543
What's your name, cop?

34:42.448 --> 34:43.713
It's a long way
to New York

34:43.715 --> 34:46.616
from Arkansas,
no conversation.

34:46.618 --> 34:50.520
How much they paying you?

34:50.522 --> 34:52.556
Tell you what,
I'll give you $10,000 right now

34:52.558 --> 34:54.558
if you let me go-- cash.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.661
What do you say, copper?

34:59.565 --> 35:01.698
(continues indistinctly)

35:05.170 --> 35:10.474
¶¶

35:14.246 --> 35:16.113
(Bugsy Siegel)
This whole case is a stretch.

35:16.115 --> 35:18.415
(man)
It's not a stretch.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.183
He's very smart.

35:20.185 --> 35:22.686
Well, we're smart too.

35:22.688 --> 35:27.357
(narrator) Back in New York,
Lucky Luciano is out on bail,

35:27.359 --> 35:31.128
facing charges
of compulsory prostitution.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.663
With just days
to prepare for the trial,

35:33.665 --> 35:37.434
the notorious gangster meets
with his lawyer and his crew

35:37.436 --> 35:42.305
to plan his defense against
special prosecutor Thomas Dewey.

35:42.307 --> 35:45.442
Charlie, this guy
really knows his stuff.

35:45.444 --> 35:46.743
That doesn't mean
he's gonna win.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.645
And he's
coming after you hard.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.314
(Bugsy Siegel) Has anyone tried
to look into this guy, huh?

35:51.316 --> 35:53.550
Pay him off? Dewey doesn't
care about money.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.418
Does he care about his life?

35:55.420 --> 35:56.786
Listen to me.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.488
There's nothing funny
about these charges.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.589
(Costello)
He's right.

35:59.591 --> 36:02.192
Dewey means business.

36:03.762 --> 36:08.899
Look, there's a lot of things
they can get me on...

36:08.901 --> 36:10.567
but not this.

36:10.569 --> 36:12.302
That's not gonna happen.

36:12.304 --> 36:15.639
¶¶

36:18.544 --> 36:20.810
(voices murmuring,
gavel banging)

36:20.812 --> 36:22.479
Court will come to order.

36:22.481 --> 36:25.415
The case of New York State
versus Charles Luciano.

36:25.417 --> 36:28.418
(narrator) Thomas Dewey
finally has Lucky Luciano

36:28.420 --> 36:29.920
right where he wants him,

36:29.922 --> 36:33.190
and after three years
of building his case,

36:33.192 --> 36:37.561
Dewey is determined to put
the gangster away for good.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.232
¶¶

36:42.234 --> 36:43.800
(voices murmuring,
gavel banging)

36:43.802 --> 36:45.735
Court will come to order.

36:45.737 --> 36:49.439
The case of New York State
versus Charles Luciano.

36:49.441 --> 36:54.344
(narrator) In 1936, the most
powerful Mob boss in America

36:54.346 --> 36:57.747
finally goes on trial.

36:57.749 --> 37:03.420
(Thomas Dewey III) The prosecution
of Luciano was the first time

37:03.422 --> 37:08.291
that a Mob member of that
seniority and stature and power

37:08.293 --> 37:11.494
had been called to account
in a courtroom.

37:11.496 --> 37:15.432
It was extraordinarily dangerous
to take the Mafia on.

37:15.434 --> 37:18.902
They had operated with impunity
for a very long time.

37:18.904 --> 37:23.440
They had substantial segments of
law enforcement and the courts

37:23.442 --> 37:24.941
in their pocket.

37:24.943 --> 37:27.644
So there was
a very substantial personal risk

37:27.646 --> 37:29.446
for my grandfather.

37:29.448 --> 37:33.783
Your Honor, the prosecution
calls Miss Jane Smith.

37:33.785 --> 37:37.621
(narrator) Thomas Dewey
launches into his case,

37:37.623 --> 37:41.391
calling prostitutes from around
the city to take the stand.

37:52.638 --> 37:58.508
You say you were afraid
to go to the police. Why?

37:58.510 --> 38:02.312
I know what they do
to squealers.

38:02.314 --> 38:07.284
Plenty of girls who talked got
burned with cigarettes...

38:07.286 --> 38:08.518
(people murmuring)

38:08.520 --> 38:11.021
...their tongues cut.

38:11.023 --> 38:13.690
(Dewey) I want to be
very specific here.

38:13.692 --> 38:18.628
Since you started working
at this establishment,

38:18.630 --> 38:23.433
how many men
would you see in a day?

38:23.435 --> 38:28.905
15... sometimes 20.

38:28.907 --> 38:31.741
(woman 3) I didn't even
know what heroin was,

38:31.743 --> 38:37.781
and... at first it was free.

38:37.783 --> 38:40.383
(tearfully)
Then it wasn't free anymore.

38:40.385 --> 38:42.886
¶¶

38:42.888 --> 38:48.358
(narrator) In total, Dewey
calls 68 witnesses...

38:48.360 --> 38:50.093
and while
the prosecutor's strategy

38:50.095 --> 38:53.663
to shock and outrage the jury
seems to be working,

38:53.665 --> 38:56.499
Luciano is unfazed.

38:56.501 --> 38:59.502
¶¶

38:59.504 --> 39:01.871
Luciano is convinced
it will take more

39:01.873 --> 39:06.710
than just the testimonies of
prostitutes to take him down.

39:06.712 --> 39:09.746
¶¶

39:10.682 --> 39:11.915
Your Honor, the prosecution

39:11.917 --> 39:14.384
calls Florence Brown
to the stand.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.686
(people murmuring)

39:30.001 --> 39:32.035
Would you state your name
for the jury, please?

39:32.037 --> 39:34.037
Florence Brown.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.941
Do you go
by any other names?

39:37.943 --> 39:40.777
People call me Cokey Flo.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.579
Why do they call you that?

39:42.581 --> 39:45.782
Take a wild guess.

39:47.919 --> 39:50.820
'Cause I like to use cocaine.

39:50.822 --> 39:53.423
(whispering and murmuring)

39:53.425 --> 39:56.526
Where do you get
cocaine from?

39:56.528 --> 39:58.962
Different places...

39:58.964 --> 40:00.930
different people.

40:00.932 --> 40:02.165
Depends.

40:02.167 --> 40:05.502
Have you ever
received cocaine...

40:05.504 --> 40:07.971
from anybody
in this courtroom?

40:14.579 --> 40:16.446
Yes.

40:16.448 --> 40:20.550
Would you be so good as to point
out that person to the jury?

40:26.425 --> 40:28.091
(people exclaim)

40:28.093 --> 40:29.659
Let the record show
that the witness is pointing

40:29.661 --> 40:32.495
at Charles "Lucky" Luciano.

40:32.497 --> 40:34.664
(people murmuring)

40:41.072 --> 40:43.706
Was this cocaine a gift?

40:43.708 --> 40:49.212
Uh, a mark of Mr. Luciano's,
uh, generosity?

40:52.050 --> 40:54.217
Not exactly.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.519
Please, enlighten us.

40:56.521 --> 40:58.588
He knew I was an addict...

40:58.590 --> 41:01.858
he knew it was my weakness...

41:01.860 --> 41:05.061
so he used it to control me
and my girls.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.666
He said he wanted
to run the whorehouses

41:09.668 --> 41:12.735
just like they do
the grocery stores.

41:12.737 --> 41:14.771
The grocery stores?

41:14.773 --> 41:16.973
I'm not sure
I understand.

41:16.975 --> 41:22.145
People come in, they pay for the
merchandise, they leave happy.

41:22.147 --> 41:26.549

42:28.046 --> 42:30.146
