00:01.359 --> 00:05.399
Anyone watching thinking we know
fuck all about knowing fuck all

00:05.400 --> 00:08.119
about owt, needs to watch
their back...

00:08.119 --> 00:11.319
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:11.320 --> 00:12.999
sending prices sky-high,

00:13.000 --> 00:17.639
literally, literally taking
the grass from its own roots!

00:17.640 --> 00:19.720
And now you've got
your ConDemNation,

00:19.721 --> 00:23.119
Liberals noshing Tories like
altar boys picking dimps up!

00:23.120 --> 00:27.879
Have we had a national
fucking stroke... or what?

00:27.880 --> 00:31.279
Is revolution a word
or was it never?

00:31.280 --> 00:34.079
Anybody watching, needs to know,
we cope better than average

00:34.080 --> 00:36.839
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.840 --> 00:41.879
Well, for fuck's sake, we live
in Manchester and they charge us

00:41.880 --> 00:43.839
for water!

00:43.840 --> 00:48.199
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found...

00:48.200 --> 00:51.399
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:51.400 --> 00:53.959
Yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak, yak!

00:53.960 --> 00:57.239
It's not theirs any more.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.719
This is our England now!

00:59.720 --> 01:02.279
Paaaarty!

01:02.280 --> 01:07.200
Contains strong language, scenes of
a sexual nature and some violence.

01:10.040 --> 01:13.120
The first throes of love
are all about passion.

01:14.560 --> 01:18.359
Eyes, hands, lips, limbs, kisses,

01:18.360 --> 01:22.719
I love yous and promises
of never-ending devotion.

01:22.720 --> 01:27.879
Burning to memory every nook
and cranny of that face,

01:27.880 --> 01:31.479
that body, drowning in each other,
getting your fill,

01:31.480 --> 01:33.919
getting more than your fill,
that thirst

01:33.920 --> 01:37.279
you can never really quench,
no matter how much you try.

01:37.280 --> 01:40.759
And fuck knows we try, don't we?

01:40.760 --> 01:44.479
'I read in some mag,
in a waiting room years back, that...

01:44.480 --> 01:48.119
'if you put a coin in a jar every
time you made love in the first

01:48.120 --> 01:51.399
'three years of your relationship,
then took one out every time

01:51.400 --> 01:53.879
'you did it after three years... '

01:53.880 --> 01:55.519
Yeah, yeah!

01:55.520 --> 01:58.079
'..you'd never ever, ever, ever... '

01:58.080 --> 02:00.359
Yeah, yeah!

02:00.360 --> 02:01.560
'..be able to empty it.'

02:22.920 --> 02:25.119
Cum again and soon.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.519
Not too soon though, eh, Tiger?

02:27.520 --> 02:29.160
Give me some time to recover.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.719
Dickhead.

02:34.720 --> 02:35.158
He's tipped you?

02:35.159 --> 02:36.278
He thinks he made me cum.

02:36.279 --> 02:37.960
Screams were almost convincing.

02:37.961 --> 02:39.639
The yelps helped.

02:39.640 --> 02:41.759
I had cramp. Came in handy.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.080
I can spot a fake a mile off.

02:43.081 --> 02:45.399
Well, I guess you've pulled
a few in your time.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.199
Didn't need to.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.358
My Brendan were gifted
in the trouser department.

02:49.359 --> 02:51.640
When he stripped off
put me in mind of a tripod.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.600
Any chance of you finishing early?

02:55.601 --> 02:58.479
We've got a stag do in any minute
now. I'd leave the girls to it

02:58.480 --> 03:00.639
but we need all hands on deck
for this one.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.839
Lillian just took a call
and the lads've been chewing Viagra

03:03.840 --> 03:05.399
since they left Burnley.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.079
They won't walk in,
they'll be pole vaulting.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.200
No worries. I'll catch
you later then, OK?

03:12.280 --> 03:14.759
He knows... that you're lying.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.519
Orgasms aren't the only thing
I'm good at faking.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.040
He hasn't got a clue.

03:20.520 --> 03:21.920
Don't know what's wrong
with her lately.

03:21.921 --> 03:23.720
I do.

03:28.720 --> 03:29.878
It's too small.

03:29.879 --> 03:31.800
It'll keep the wind off your back.

03:31.801 --> 03:35.759
Yeah and give me twatting frostbite
at the front.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.639
I'll look like a fucking nutter.

03:38.640 --> 03:39.960
But you are a fucking nutter.

03:39.961 --> 03:41.799
Take no notice.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.039
Beggars can't be choosers.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.999
As soon as you get a few bob
rolling in, it's me and you

03:47.000 --> 03:49.679
straight down to Primani
for a proper makeover.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.680
But until then,
it's our Shane's cast-offs.

03:51.681 --> 03:52.839
It suits you.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.519
Yeah, it looks... nice.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.480
It's pink and it smells of perfume.

03:56.481 --> 03:59.239
Only real men can wear pink.
And it's aftershave that.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.919
This is a bird's fluffy jumper.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.678
Angora. He's allergic to manmade.

04:03.679 --> 04:05.040
It's got tit shapes in it.

04:05.041 --> 04:07.079
Must've been me mam's.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.200
You need to try it on.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.678
You look lovely.

04:18.680 --> 04:21.279
None of it fits! Right?

04:21.279 --> 04:22.879
I can't survive much longer

04:22.880 --> 04:25.799
on two pairs of socks, three
T-shirts and a pair of undies.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.039
Just one pair?

04:28.040 --> 04:31.119
I wish I'd known that sooner.

04:31.120 --> 04:34.039
I'm only on a tea break.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.480
Laters.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.439
Look, just go commando
whilst they wash and dry.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.800
Ready for action.

04:42.801 --> 04:44.519
Homo! Sorry.

04:44.520 --> 04:46.880
I can't, I'll chafe.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.920
It was only going go on a bottle
of baby oil and some poppers.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.840
You've been a pal to me, Micky.

05:01.841 --> 05:04.399
And if I were queer,
I'd bum you here and now.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.400
Thanks, Marty.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.199
You're going to make someone
a lovely wife... partner one day.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.680
But I've got to stand up
on my own two feet.

05:13.681 --> 05:16.480
I need cash,
so I'll have to do a job.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.080
Get a job.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.480
Everybody get down!

05:25.160 --> 05:26.839
Shut up. Shut your...

05:26.840 --> 05:28.278
This is a fuck up!

05:28.279 --> 05:30.240
Shut the fuck up...
this is a stick up!

05:30.241 --> 05:32.480
Rectal prolapse!

05:33.600 --> 05:35.880
Gimme the money, gimme the money!

05:39.720 --> 05:41.039
Evil...!

05:41.040 --> 05:42.160
Fuck off!

05:46.560 --> 05:49.159
Sit down, wait till you see this.
It's class!

05:49.160 --> 05:51.080
Come on, you're in my seat.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.440
Soon have you smiling again, girl!

06:03.160 --> 06:05.799
Isn't that the shittest...

06:05.800 --> 06:08.439
crappest robber
you have ever seen?

06:08.440 --> 06:10.359
How much did he get away with?

06:10.360 --> 06:12.919
Enough for some chips and a taxi
home!

06:12.920 --> 06:14.120
Fucking shame of it!

06:26.040 --> 06:27.720
You know who that was?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.679
You know.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.159
I don't know.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.439
So... why don't you tell me?

06:36.440 --> 06:37.320
Marty.

06:37.321 --> 06:38.799
How'd you know?

06:38.800 --> 06:40.120
He was wearing my old coat.

06:40.121 --> 06:42.799
Not his style, is it?
Armed robbery, not the coat.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.679
I don't his fucking style.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.799
It's only a matter of time before
the filth get their shit together

06:47.800 --> 06:50.279
and clock it's him.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.439
And? Arrest him.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.480
You're not arsed?

06:53.481 --> 06:55.319
He's a punter, Shane.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.919
Offering ten-grand reward
for somebody to grass him up.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.599
If he's daft enough to threaten
people with a gun,

07:01.600 --> 07:03.399
he deserves grassing up.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.840
It's deposit on a house that,
you know, ten grand.

07:04.841 --> 07:08.040
Maguires don't grass.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.599
Fucking stupid though, weren't it?

07:14.600 --> 07:17.359
He is fucking stupid.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.319
Aren't you?!

07:19.320 --> 07:20.719
I said aren't you!?

07:20.720 --> 07:23.039
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

07:23.040 --> 07:25.679
I'm here, skint, I can't work,
I can't sign on.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.719
What, in case the police catch you

07:27.720 --> 07:30.039
for non-payment of maintenance,
you mean?

07:30.040 --> 07:33.999
As opposed to armed fucking robbery,
you gormless twat!

07:34.000 --> 07:35.440
I needed money!

07:35.441 --> 07:36.999
Then ask!

07:37.000 --> 07:40.799
Don't go holding up Post Offices
with fucking guns!

07:40.800 --> 07:42.479
You could've killed someone,

07:42.480 --> 07:45.279
some poor bastard
collecting their pension.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.560
You could've got killed yourself
and then what would I have done?!

07:52.760 --> 07:55.399
I mean, how would I have explained
that to Sue?

07:55.400 --> 07:57.680
Where'd you get the gun?

07:59.080 --> 08:02.799
They're stashed here! It's family
stuff, you know the score, Kel!

08:02.800 --> 08:06.519
You keep him away from guns, you got
that? Guns and fucking matches!

08:06.520 --> 08:07.919
Sorry!

08:07.920 --> 08:10.519
It could bring a load
of trouble and...

08:10.520 --> 08:12.999
We've had enough... That... that gun,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.680
could be linked to Shane,
maybe and they'll...

08:29.440 --> 08:31.080
You're looking lovely.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.679
You do, you look dead nice, like.
Nice.

08:35.679 --> 08:38.159
Proper like... glowing,

08:38.159 --> 08:39.559
healthily.

08:40.679 --> 08:43.239
I was thinking... do you want me
to make tea tonight?

08:43.240 --> 08:44.238
What's going on?

08:44.239 --> 08:46.200
Why would anything be going on?

08:46.201 --> 08:48.839
I was married longer
than you've been alive.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.919
And I know that when a man's
buttering you up

08:51.920 --> 08:54.399
with a string of compliments,
he's about to do

08:54.400 --> 08:56.519
one of two things -
confess or request.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.319
Which is it?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.440
Er...

08:59.441 --> 09:02.959
Don't lie! If you've got
something to say, say it.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.360
I've just...

09:04.361 --> 09:05.679
Speak!

09:05.680 --> 09:09.599
Well, now it's out in the open,
who Cilla's dad is,

09:09.600 --> 09:11.640
I was thinking if like...
if we could...

09:11.641 --> 09:15.079
well, when she's Christened,
if we could give her a second name?

09:15.080 --> 09:17.280
You know, cos her mam
gave her her first name,

09:17.281 --> 09:19.280
her dad can give her her second.

09:19.281 --> 09:21.279
What were you thinking of?

09:21.280 --> 09:21.918
Maureen.

09:21.919 --> 09:22.678
Fuck off.

09:22.679 --> 09:23.760
What, it's me mam's name.

09:23.761 --> 09:25.519
She can keep it.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.359
It's not fair, Mimi.
You get to do everything

09:28.360 --> 09:30.720
and I just get shit on by you,
Shane, Jamie and Micky.

09:30.721 --> 09:31.959
OK.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.160
Always taking the piss out of...
out of me.

09:34.161 --> 09:35.760
Did you just say OK then?

09:38.160 --> 09:40.799
On one condition.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.519
That you convert,
come over to our side.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.519
You mean support Liverpool?

09:46.520 --> 09:49.679
I mean become a Catholic,
you knobhead.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.880
Right. Yeah, yeah.

10:04.840 --> 10:09.079
You've been named, Marty boy.
Armed robber at the Post Office.

10:09.080 --> 10:12.239
Cuddly little Marty
with his funny little ways.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.599
Wouldn't harm a fly, eh?

10:14.600 --> 10:16.000
F... f... fuck off.

10:16.001 --> 10:19.159
Terrify a gang of pensioners half to
death in a Post Office queue, yes,

10:19.160 --> 10:20.360
but wouldn't harm a fly.

10:20.361 --> 10:21.879
Fuck off, Shane.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.559
Come on, I'm fucking with you.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.759
You know what, I've been doing
a bit of research, mate.

10:26.760 --> 10:31.399
All you have to do is type in
'Arson' and 'Fuengerola'

10:31.400 --> 10:34.240
and it's fucking amazing
what pops up.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.879
You know, it's funny you never
mentioned that your wife and kids

10:39.880 --> 10:42.279
died in a house fire.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.559
Anyone'd think you had
something to hide, mate.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.599
Save your breath, Marty,
you're going to need it.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.119
I just called the filth.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.039
I've told them where you were.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.520
Run.

10:57.800 --> 10:58.840
Run!

11:15.080 --> 11:19.479
I've got a few more
cast-offs for Marty...

11:19.480 --> 11:23.879
I was dr... dragged
out of bed last night

11:23.880 --> 11:26.279
by an armed copper

11:26.280 --> 11:28.839
with his gun shoved half-way
up my fucking nostril!

11:28.840 --> 11:29.760
What, family stuff?

11:29.761 --> 11:31.839
They were asking me where Marty was.

11:31.840 --> 11:35.959
I said, "I don't know",
and spent the next...

11:35.960 --> 11:40.519
nine hours helping the police
with their enquiries.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.160
Someone must've grassed.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.160
That'd be me.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.799
And since when did you develop
a conscience?

11:49.800 --> 11:54.439
When I found out Marty's wife
and kids died in an arson attack.

11:54.440 --> 11:58.959
Spate of fires across Fuengerola.
Culprit never found.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.439
But you got a fucking nutter
out there

12:01.440 --> 12:06.239
with a history of that sort of stuff
and, well, one and one... is two.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.398
He killed them?

12:07.399 --> 12:08.880
Yep. Seems that way.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.159
I was thinking of a trip into town.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.519
Get you some new gear,
something to eat, eh?

12:15.520 --> 12:19.879
That ten grand you got for grassing
him up burning a hole in your pocket?

12:19.880 --> 12:21.560
It were anonymous.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.039
I'm booked solid all morning.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.919
Who wants a fuck at this hour?

12:26.920 --> 12:30.480
You... Once upon a time.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.679
The thing is, I don't know anything
about God or religion, Father.

12:36.680 --> 12:40.119
He's C of E. Is he allowed
to change sides, Father?

12:40.120 --> 12:43.599
We don't really think of it
as sides, now, do we, Mimi?

12:43.600 --> 12:46.559
It'll be a lot of hard work
on your part, Billy.

12:46.560 --> 12:49.879
You'll have to research the faith,
attend classes.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.198
He's not afraid
of a bit of hard work.

12:52.199 --> 12:53.640
It's for my daughter.

12:53.641 --> 12:54.959
And for you, too.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.920
Front of the queue
at the Pearly Gates

12:56.921 --> 12:59.919
if you're a Catholic, eh, Father?

12:59.920 --> 13:02.839
We'll keep it informal
for the time being.

13:02.840 --> 13:03.878
Yeah.

13:03.879 --> 13:06.280
Look forward to getting to know you
as well as the rest of the family.

13:06.281 --> 13:09.079
Lovely seeing you, Father.

13:09.080 --> 13:09.840
And you, Mimi.

13:09.841 --> 13:11.279
Take care.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.079
I will.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.679
See ya.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.159
Micky. Father.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.560
Bye now!

13:19.680 --> 13:21.718
What's he doing here?
Has someone died?

13:21.719 --> 13:23.120
Billy's going to be a Catholic.

13:23.121 --> 13:25.199
What the fuck for? It's shit!

13:25.200 --> 13:28.679
Thou shall not do this,
that and the other. And the guilt.

13:28.680 --> 13:31.479
Takes you about a week
to get over spilling your seed.

13:31.480 --> 13:33.999
Stay Proddy, man, much more fun.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.078
I'm doing it for Cilla.

13:35.079 --> 13:36.598
You're doing it to get in
with me mam.

13:36.599 --> 13:38.398
It's for my daughter, your sister.

13:38.399 --> 13:39.520
She won't thank you.

13:39.521 --> 13:42.079
If I was going to change,
I'd go Muslim.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.799
Food's better and all you've
got to do is grow a beard.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.878
You won't even pass the exams,
you, anyway.

13:46.879 --> 13:48.118
Why's that, then?

13:48.119 --> 13:49.440
Cos you're a thick cunt.

13:56.280 --> 13:57.759
Mam!

13:57.760 --> 13:59.000
Mam!

13:59.001 --> 14:01.479
You, living room, now!

14:01.480 --> 14:03.599
It wasn't me!

14:03.600 --> 14:05.720
Don't have me saying it twice!

14:13.040 --> 14:15.319
No matter how hard I try,

14:15.320 --> 14:18.279
your lads are just going to keep
throwing it back in my face.

14:18.280 --> 14:19.480
Nothing I do'll ever be
good enough for them.

14:19.481 --> 14:24.079
It's a lot for them to take on,
you being here. Going to take time.

14:24.080 --> 14:27.359
You can handle this.
You're a tough lad.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.679
Made of sterner stuff
than they know. Aren't you?

14:30.680 --> 14:31.920
Yeah.

14:31.921 --> 14:34.920
Now, these spuds aren't going to
peel themselves, are they?

14:45.600 --> 14:47.319
Shane's here.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.319
I told you. Tell him I'm occupied.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.559
I did but he said he'd wait.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.440
Look, if you and him's
got a problem, sort it!

14:53.441 --> 14:55.521
Cos punters don't like
looking at a face like

14:55.522 --> 14:57.600
a smacked arse.
They can get that at home.

14:58.720 --> 15:03.920
Give me a minute. Tell him I'm just
tidying, then send him up.

15:17.240 --> 15:20.719
The only time I see anything floral
is weddings, funerals

15:20.720 --> 15:23.759
and when you're trying to keep me
sweet after a fuck-up.

15:23.760 --> 15:24.920
By way of an apology?

15:24.921 --> 15:25.999
A fuck-up.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.399
Yeah. A monumental fuck-up.

15:29.400 --> 15:33.999
You know, I've been that busy,
my mind's been preoccupied

15:34.000 --> 15:36.360
with a million and one
different things,

15:36.361 --> 15:40.240
and I... I've neglected
the one thing that I value most.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.639
I said thing, I don't...

15:43.640 --> 15:45.159
I mean you.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.560
And I'm sorry.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.519
I know you've been
distracted as well.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.599
Hang on a minute...
I don't blame you.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.120
I forced you away.

16:05.960 --> 16:09.880
It takes two to tango... badly.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.199
We are good, us, y'know.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.759
We used to be.

16:14.760 --> 16:15.560
We still are.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.160
Let's make a bit of time.

16:22.520 --> 16:23.920
Get away from here.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.640
I want to be your husband again.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.759
I love you, Kelly Maguire.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.199
Yeah?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.199
Yeah.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.399
Yeah?

16:36.400 --> 16:37.800
Yes.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.599
Yeah?

16:42.600 --> 16:44.640
Yes!

16:54.840 --> 16:58.319
Yeah! Let's go!

16:58.320 --> 17:00.239
He's lovely, isn't he?

17:00.240 --> 17:03.919
Wouldn't think that if you had to
spend as long as me looking at him.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.638
I meant Father Craig.
So did I.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.279
Ever since Billy
started his conversion classes,

17:09.280 --> 17:12.039
we can't get rid of him.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.079
Well, he can convert me any time.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.839
Oi! I heard that.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.880
What?

17:55.881 --> 17:59.319
Personal Jesus

17:59.320 --> 18:01.039
What's got you smiling?

18:01.040 --> 18:02.959
Wouldn't you like to know!

18:02.960 --> 18:05.680
The look of love, little twinkle
in the eye I can detect?

18:08.160 --> 18:10.439
Sorted your differences, then?

18:10.440 --> 18:15.280
Never heard it called that before
but... we talked.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.999
Toilets.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.240
Now!

18:25.080 --> 18:27.319
Look, I'm tired, that's all this is.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.480
I'm relieved your marriage
is back on track.

18:29.481 --> 18:31.279
I appreciate the concern...

18:31.280 --> 18:33.839
but we've never been close
and I'm not the sister type.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.720
I just wish I'd had
someone to talk to when

18:35.721 --> 18:37.599
me and Jamie were
fucking ourselves over.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.799
We've had a rough few months. Like I
said, we've talked and we're OK.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.119
Good, I'm glad. Cos it'd be all too
easy to get hung up on someone

18:44.120 --> 18:46.639
who might let you down, wouldn't it?

18:46.640 --> 18:50.639
You know, someone who might offer
a bit of excitement short-term...

18:50.640 --> 18:52.799
But long-term?

18:52.800 --> 18:56.239
You wouldn't back him if he was a
horse at the National, would you?

18:56.240 --> 18:58.319
No, I don't think I would.

18:58.961 --> 19:00.520
Use the men's!

19:03.320 --> 19:07.519
Sometimes we can get distracted.
Things can seem a bit mundane.

19:07.520 --> 19:11.039
We think the grass is always greener
but before long we've...

19:11.040 --> 19:12.960
I lost everything.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.159
This isn't a bollocking, Kel.

19:16.160 --> 19:20.119
I just don't want you
to make the same mistake I did.

19:20.120 --> 19:20.798
Joe?

19:21.839 --> 19:23.278
There's no bog roll.

19:23.279 --> 19:24.360
Well, drip dry.

19:24.361 --> 19:28.159
Without going into detail, that
approach won't have much effect.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.480
Fine.

19:34.040 --> 19:38.080
You can talk to me, you know,
when it comes to stuff like this.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.879
You can trust me.

19:51.440 --> 19:56.719
Jamie, usual, double and whatever
those boring bastards are having.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.599
With a cyanide-fucking-chaser
for each of them.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.439
You not enjoying it?

20:01.440 --> 20:04.199
He's everywhere I turn.
Never shuts the fuck up!

20:04.200 --> 20:07.519
God this, God that, God the other.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.998
He's got a bleeding
parable for everything.

20:09.999 --> 20:12.400
Can't even wipe your arse
without him turning it

20:12.401 --> 20:15.159
into some kind of a lesson.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.600
Hello, Father Craig!

20:20.560 --> 20:23.359
Hiya, Father. Going already?

20:23.360 --> 20:26.199
Service in the morning, Mimi.
Billy says you'll be there.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.840
Not going to miss out, am I?

20:34.600 --> 20:35.998
Stop this now.

20:35.999 --> 20:36.680
Gone!

20:36.681 --> 20:38.680
I-I just wanted to impress you.

20:38.681 --> 20:43.320
Get rid of that boring bastard,
then I'll be impressed.

20:55.600 --> 20:59.079
She obviously wants
something extreme.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.000
Y'know,
a declaration of your intentions.

21:01.001 --> 21:03.159
Reckon?

21:03.160 --> 21:06.599
Think big, Billy. It's obviously the
way to her heart. If not her heart,

21:06.600 --> 21:09.679
might get you into her knickers.

21:09.680 --> 21:12.799
What d'you think she'd really,
really like?

21:12.800 --> 21:16.960
What d'you reckon'd make her happy?
Her and the boys?

21:20.200 --> 21:22.319
What's going on?

21:22.320 --> 21:24.640
Well, I just want you to be happy,
that's all.

21:24.641 --> 21:26.159
So...

21:26.160 --> 21:28.480
I did something
that'd make you happy.

21:39.880 --> 21:42.479
So you robbed my car?

21:42.480 --> 21:43.799
Borrowed.

21:43.800 --> 21:44.878
Then what the fuck did you give him?

21:44.879 --> 21:47.320
Just a load of ale.
Bottle of whisky.

21:47.321 --> 21:51.119
And? Some pills I found in Micky's
sock drawer.

21:51.120 --> 21:51.560
The blue ones?

21:51.561 --> 21:52.919
Orange?

21:52.920 --> 21:54.399
Not the yellow ones.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.919
One of them'd floor all the Happy
Mondays! How many d'you slip him?

21:57.920 --> 21:59.279
Four.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.159
Well no wonder he's dead!

22:01.160 --> 22:04.599
They're meant for horses
of a nervous disposition!

22:04.600 --> 22:07.038
What in the name of God
did you think you were doing?

22:07.039 --> 22:09.440
You said you'd be impressed
if I got rid of him!

22:09.441 --> 22:12.439
I didn't mean kill him,
you thick twat!

22:12.440 --> 22:15.639
I meant out of my line of vision
for a split second!

22:15.640 --> 22:18.319
Out of my range of hearing,
not bleeding dead!

22:18.320 --> 22:20.280
So what we going to do?

22:21.360 --> 22:24.799
Pray for forgiveness.
He's killed a Priest.

22:24.800 --> 22:28.919
Well, let him fucking pray then.
It's nowt to do with us.

22:28.920 --> 22:31.320
I'm going to hell.
And I'm not even Catholic!

22:31.321 --> 22:34.279
And you think God's going
to turn a blind eye to the fact

22:34.280 --> 22:39.159
that we're sitting round discussing
how to get shot of the body!?

22:39.160 --> 22:41.200
Er, excuse me, I
just came up with a

22:41.201 --> 22:43.239
solution that went down
like a lead balloon.

22:43.240 --> 22:47.319
The solution being that we take him
to your mate's sausage factory?!

22:47.320 --> 22:48.959
You've never objected before.

22:48.960 --> 22:52.720
I've never turned a priest
into a sausage before!

22:54.200 --> 22:56.199
We'll be excommunicated.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.399
We're already excommunicated.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.279
Call your mate.
Make the arrangements.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.239
Hang on...

23:04.240 --> 23:06.999
You're not actually going
to go through with this?

23:07.000 --> 23:09.239
Have you got a better solution?

23:09.240 --> 23:13.880
Remarkable. Just when I thought
you'd never be able to shock me...

23:15.280 --> 23:20.199
OK, if we're going ahead with this,
you need to make yourself scarce.

23:20.200 --> 23:24.399
No way! He got us into this shit,
he's going to help get us out!

23:24.400 --> 23:26.540
They'll get a fair few
sausages out of him,

23:26.541 --> 23:28.679
though, won't they?
He was a big lad, wasn't he?

23:28.680 --> 23:30.040
Fucking arse!

23:52.640 --> 23:53.680
Kelly!

23:53.681 --> 23:56.160
What d'you want?

23:58.480 --> 24:00.839
Played me for a fool, didn't you?

24:00.840 --> 24:02.519
No.

24:02.520 --> 24:06.719
Not that I blame you. I am a fucking
idiot... falling for you... your lies.

24:06.720 --> 24:09.279
If you think I lied,
why did you come?

24:09.280 --> 24:14.119
To tell you to get out my life,
to keep on running.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.400
Fuck off so far away from me
and never come back!

24:16.401 --> 24:19.039
Sue left me.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.799
She walked out and took the kids.

24:21.800 --> 24:24.599
She wanted stuff I couldn't give her
and...

24:24.600 --> 24:26.199
She found someone who could.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.759
And I begged her...

24:28.760 --> 24:32.000
I begged her to come back,
but she said, "To what?"

24:33.760 --> 24:34.960
To what.

24:36.280 --> 24:38.519
I was on my own.

24:38.520 --> 24:41.239
And I was getting pissed most nights
cos...

24:41.240 --> 24:45.840
And I lost my job cos I couldn't
get out of bed for the hangovers.

24:47.560 --> 24:50.199
I ended up on the street.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.319
And I was angry with myself,
I was so angry.

24:53.320 --> 24:57.040
I'd lost my wife, my kids...
My job, my flat.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.240
So you set fire to them?

25:06.440 --> 25:10.160
Took a while,
but here he is at last, eh?

25:11.320 --> 25:13.879
Will the real Marty Fisher
please stand up.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.559
Look...
The lying, murdering Marty Fisher.

25:16.560 --> 25:17.480
No, no, I-I-I...

25:17.481 --> 25:18.999
Save it.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.200
I thought you were different.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.639
Fucking cliche alert!

25:27.640 --> 25:30.719
I hope they find you, Marty.

25:30.720 --> 25:34.680
I hope the filth drag you in
and I hope you go down for life.

25:36.040 --> 25:37.720
Sue didn't deserve that.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.600
And your kids...

25:43.160 --> 25:44.600
K-K-Kelly...

25:44.601 --> 25:46.199
Fuck off.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.600
I love you!

25:50.400 --> 25:52.560
And I love Shane.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.440
Shit!

26:14.441 --> 26:16.440
They're still looking for Marty.

26:16.441 --> 26:19.879
Right, Father Craig's pissed
after an all-night wake.

26:19.880 --> 26:22.479
We're taking him back to church.
Everyone stay calm.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.838
Can I ask where you're going, lads?

26:23.839 --> 26:26.240
Just bringing a mate home.
Bit worse for wear.

26:26.241 --> 26:29.399
Hope you sober up for Sunday,
Father! Me daughter's christening.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.199
He's going to puke!

26:31.200 --> 26:32.920
Do you want to get out, Father?

26:32.921 --> 26:34.519
No! He's just rat-arsed.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.878
Don't tell the Pope

26:35.879 --> 26:37.880
D'you want to open the boot
for us, please?

26:39.200 --> 26:39.999
Shh!

26:40.000 --> 26:42.039
I can't...

26:42.040 --> 26:43.560
Shut the fuck up!

26:46.120 --> 26:46.998
Yeah, that's great, mate.

26:46.999 --> 26:48.278
Cheers.

26:48.279 --> 26:50.000
Your other mate looks bad, too.

26:50.001 --> 26:53.879
He can't handle his booze. Think it
was the punch what finished him off!

26:53.880 --> 26:55.960
That'll teach him. Cheers, lads.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.840
See you, Father!

27:05.240 --> 27:06.319
Vodka.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.319
Double.

27:07.320 --> 27:08.798
And one for yourself, Mimi.

27:08.799 --> 27:11.198
Fuck knows you could do with one.
What you having?

27:11.199 --> 27:12.200
Bit early for me.

27:16.960 --> 27:20.879
To the useless, lying,
two-faced, manipulative,

27:20.880 --> 27:23.919
deceitful gang of total
bastardry that is men!

27:23.920 --> 27:26.199
Fuck knows I'll drink to that.

27:26.200 --> 27:29.519
Unless it's our Shane
you're talking about?

27:29.520 --> 27:32.880
A punter.
Finally revealed his true colours.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.160
Same again please, Mimi.

27:37.161 --> 27:40.679
You're working in ten minutes.
The barbershop quartet's in.

27:40.680 --> 27:43.118
You fuck 'em. Turn the light off,
they'd never know the difference.

27:43.119 --> 27:44.320
Course they would!

27:44.321 --> 27:47.879
This is the male of the species
we're talking about, brains in cocks.

27:47.880 --> 27:50.439
And there's not much room in there
for a brain.

27:50.440 --> 27:53.959
Fuck 'em yourself, or better still,
tell 'em to go fuck themselves.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.839
You've had two verbal warnings,
Kelly.

27:56.840 --> 27:57.960
Third written.

27:57.961 --> 28:00.039
What - you're going to dismiss me?

28:00.040 --> 28:04.559
Then I take you to a tribunal and...
No, that's right I can't!

28:04.560 --> 28:06.799
On account of your business
being illegal

28:06.800 --> 28:09.039
and you'd end up in nick
for being a madam!

28:09.040 --> 28:10.880
Madame!

28:14.480 --> 28:16.359
All you need do sometimes,

28:16.360 --> 28:19.479
is take a step back
to get a good perspective, isn't it?

28:19.480 --> 28:21.159
Where's all this coming from?

28:21.160 --> 28:23.959
From me being let down
once too often. That's where from.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.079
Shane?

28:25.080 --> 28:26.120
No, we're good.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.160
Yeah?

28:29.520 --> 28:30.480
Yeah.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.120
Y'all right, kidda?

28:52.240 --> 28:53.278
All right, mate?

28:53.279 --> 28:53.918
Not bad, mate?

28:53.919 --> 28:54.920
Yeah, good-good.

28:56.040 --> 28:57.120
Nice one.

29:00.920 --> 29:02.120
All right, boys.

29:02.121 --> 29:04.159
All right, mate.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.239
Right, we need to get him in here,
yeah?

29:06.240 --> 29:08.319
And then get him
to the processing room.

29:08.320 --> 29:10.919
There'll be a tea break
in ten minutes. It'll be empty.

29:10.920 --> 29:11.960
I'll need a hand stripping him.

29:11.961 --> 29:13.079
I'll do it.

29:13.080 --> 29:15.600
You want to bring him over here,
Mickey?

29:24.480 --> 29:25.480
Oof!

29:32.480 --> 29:33.720
Shit!

29:42.760 --> 29:47.040
Mam... you need to be here,
and quick.

30:05.960 --> 30:08.120
You said you'd checked he was dead!

30:09.400 --> 30:10.638
I did!

30:10.639 --> 30:12.800
Well, you obviously
didn't check properly!

30:31.880 --> 30:34.839
It's a miracle.
I'm telling you, it's a miracle!

30:34.840 --> 30:36.520
Go! Leave the talking to me.

30:43.360 --> 30:46.919
And I prayed and prayed to God

30:46.920 --> 30:50.560
to find a solution and he did.

30:52.320 --> 30:53.560
You OK, Father?

30:55.040 --> 30:57.039
I, er...

30:57.040 --> 30:58.400
I don't know.

30:59.920 --> 31:02.599
I'm sorry, Mimi,
I'm not feeling 100%.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.760
Must've nodded off.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.480
Had the weirdest dream.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.200
And the Lord said to me...

31:20.080 --> 31:23.359
Next time you want to impress me,
try a bunch of roses,

31:23.360 --> 31:24.840
a box of chocolates.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.039
We were lucky this time, Billy.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.438
Make sure there isn't a next time.

31:28.439 --> 31:30.838
You said he was a problem.
Thought you wanted rid.

31:30.839 --> 31:32.360
Why'd she go to you if she did?

31:32.361 --> 31:34.679
Cos... cos I'm the father
of her child.

31:34.680 --> 31:35.880
That was a biological accident.

31:35.881 --> 31:37.839
A happy one!

31:37.840 --> 31:39.720
Yeah, but an accident
none the less, Mum.

31:39.721 --> 31:41.359
Get this straight, Billy.

31:41.360 --> 31:44.199
If there's a problem in this family
that needs solving,

31:44.200 --> 31:46.559
this family will solve it,
you got that?

31:46.560 --> 31:48.520
We don't need you. Don't want you.

31:49.720 --> 31:51.720
By the way, you've pissed yourself.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.599
That hit the spot.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.320
It was lovely, that.

32:05.321 --> 32:06.759
Thought you'd like it.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.160
Liked it? I loved it.

32:08.161 --> 32:11.039
You don't have to overdo it, Shane.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.880
No, it was nice that!

32:12.881 --> 32:14.479
It was chips, bacon and egg.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.919
It was great!

32:16.920 --> 32:18.480
I'll do washing up.

32:18.481 --> 32:19.639
No.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.920
Come on, I said...
I know, and I said I'll do it!

32:23.280 --> 32:24.520
Sorry.

32:24.521 --> 32:25.719
No, it's me.

32:25.720 --> 32:27.719
No, I'm probably trying a bit...

32:27.720 --> 32:28.840
Don't. It's not you.

32:28.841 --> 32:30.279
This.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.959
It's not you. It's me, Shane.

32:31.960 --> 32:33.680
Just, em...

32:36.760 --> 32:37.920
it's just me.

32:40.520 --> 32:43.720
That mean I can go watch the footy
that I recorded?

32:48.760 --> 32:51.120
I love you, Kelly Maguire.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.880
Yeah, you said.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.720
Thank you, Carmel.

33:22.520 --> 33:24.800
Just thought we'd give you this,
Father.

33:24.801 --> 33:27.399
Our contribution
to the new roof for the vestry.

33:27.400 --> 33:30.159
That's very kind. Thank you.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.800
So, ten minutes, yeah?

33:31.801 --> 33:33.759
For?

33:33.760 --> 33:35.959
Nice one.

33:35.960 --> 33:37.400
Making out he's forgot.

33:37.401 --> 33:39.119
You!

33:39.120 --> 33:40.678
Cilla's christening.

33:40.679 --> 33:42.640
Two o'clock.

33:42.641 --> 33:44.199
You did say two?

33:44.200 --> 33:49.119
Course I didn't forget,
how could I forget a thing like that.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.360
And Billy is proper excited, yeah.

33:52.720 --> 33:55.519
About getting christened,
the same time as his daughter!

33:55.520 --> 33:57.879
Very kind of you to fast-track him.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.599
He's welling up.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.800
You know, he's so proud.

34:03.360 --> 34:03.838
I'm going myself.

34:03.839 --> 34:04.920
I'll just prepare.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.719
I'm sorry.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.320
What the fuck's going on?!

34:27.321 --> 34:28.438
Baptism.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.839
Cilla's. And you're godparents.

34:30.840 --> 34:33.039
Lovely.

34:33.040 --> 34:33.358
When?

34:33.359 --> 34:34.560
Now.

34:34.561 --> 34:35.599
Nice one.

34:35.600 --> 34:38.319
If I snuff it, soft arse'd
get custody of Cilla.

34:38.320 --> 34:41.239
That's not going to happen.

34:41.239 --> 34:43.000
Look at him.

34:43.001 --> 34:44.599
He's a lovely lad,

34:44.600 --> 34:47.559
but a few bricks short
of a full hod, know what I mean?

34:47.560 --> 34:49.719
Mimi, I don't actually believe in...

34:49.719 --> 34:53.319
We've heard it all before, Kelly.
You don't believe in God, we know.

34:53.320 --> 34:56.518
Half the congregation'll
be in the same boat.

34:56.520 --> 34:59.439
I just want you to nod
when you're supposed to,

34:59.440 --> 35:01.999
light a candle, renounce the devil,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.919
then get back to the pub
and get pissed with the rest of us.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.160
Got that?

35:06.161 --> 35:07.800
Come on, soft lad.

35:09.320 --> 35:11.039
Did that just happen?

35:11.040 --> 35:12.559
Who does she think she is?

35:12.560 --> 35:14.880
Geez. Come on, Kel,
she's always like that.

35:14.881 --> 35:16.359
Well, she can fuck off!

35:16.360 --> 35:18.439
You know what?
You're always like that.

35:18.440 --> 35:21.359
And you're always like that.
Sitting on the fucking fence.

35:21.360 --> 35:24.439
What's it going to take for you
to back me up, mummy's boy?

35:27.160 --> 35:29.760
You knew what you were getting into
when you took me on.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.599
Hang on, wait for me!

36:05.160 --> 36:07.519
Barbara Castle? In her day.

36:07.520 --> 36:10.399
Edwina Currie? Posh Scouser.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.519
A contradiction in terms.

36:12.520 --> 36:15.599
See, I'd have slotted
Thatcher one in her heyday.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.359
From behind, obviously.
Show her who's boss.

36:18.360 --> 36:19.719
"Ooh, not for turning?"

36:19.720 --> 36:22.239
Well, you fucking will be
after this, Maggie.

36:22.240 --> 36:25.799
One up the mineshaft
in memory of Scargill.

36:25.800 --> 36:27.199
But Widdecombe?

36:27.200 --> 36:31.079
Wouldn't really be an angle
that would satisfy, would there?

36:31.080 --> 36:34.479
It's not as if you could half
close your eyes, so they're all fuzzy

36:34.480 --> 36:37.359
and convince yourself
it's somebody else.

36:37.360 --> 36:40.879
Fucking Churchill would be
a more attractive proposition.

36:40.880 --> 36:43.119
Miliband's got a pretty face.

36:43.120 --> 36:47.399
I think your mistake was going
for someone with such a low profile.

36:47.400 --> 36:48.680
What do you mean?

36:48.681 --> 36:52.279
A priest? If you want to impress
the Maguires, aim high.

36:52.280 --> 36:56.519
Take out some gangster
and you'd be quids in. Telling you.

36:56.520 --> 36:59.439
You want to reach puberty,
keep your trap shut.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.560
Bin. Now.

37:05.600 --> 37:08.759
If I'd wanted a gangster,
I wouldn't have gotten rid of Paddy.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.999
I like you because you're you, OK?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.800
Just be you.

37:15.440 --> 37:16.920
A toast!

37:19.320 --> 37:23.519
To Cilla Maureen Tutton-Maguire.
Welcome to the family.

37:23.520 --> 37:27.559
Welcome to the family!

37:27.560 --> 37:30.079
And to Billy Tutton.
Welcome to the family.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.960
Welcome to the family!

37:33.040 --> 37:34.560
You're one of us, now.

37:37.240 --> 37:40.360
She means Catholic, by the way.
Not one of them.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.320
For fuck's sake!

37:56.440 --> 37:58.479
What the fuck's done that?

37:58.480 --> 37:59.120
Rats.

37:59.121 --> 38:00.800
Big fucking rat!

38:25.400 --> 38:27.999
Excuse I for queue jumping.
I've got a turtle's head.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.198
They're all occupied and I'm next.

38:29.199 --> 38:30.638
I'm touching cloth!

38:30.639 --> 38:31.640
Gents!

38:35.200 --> 38:36.479
I'm...

38:36.480 --> 38:37.999
Sorry?

38:38.000 --> 38:41.679
Going to do the decent thing?
Hand yourself in?

38:41.680 --> 38:45.759
Admit you're a fucking scumbag
for killing your wife and kids?

38:45.760 --> 38:47.879
A pathological liar

38:47.880 --> 38:50.399
for making me believe
we had some kind of future?

38:50.400 --> 38:51.800
Wasn't supposed to happen this way.

38:51.801 --> 38:53.919
Too right!

38:53.920 --> 38:56.039
I wasn't supposed
to fall for the nutter

38:56.040 --> 38:59.839
with fuck all to offer but a
criminal record and an empty wallet.

38:59.840 --> 39:04.279
I wanted the white charger and
the shining armour and I get you!

39:04.280 --> 39:07.640
Fucking you!

39:09.080 --> 39:10.798
Lights will be back on any minute.

39:10.799 --> 39:11.800
Great.

39:18.480 --> 39:21.919
Making sure no-one's fallen over,
broken their neck.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.760
Home soon, eh?

39:29.320 --> 39:33.119
You never asked. That's what
fucking hurt. After what we'd said.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.719
What you said you felt.
You never asked.

39:35.720 --> 39:36.839
Never!

39:36.840 --> 39:38.278
What did I never ask, eh?

39:38.279 --> 39:39.040
You fucking lunatic!

39:39.041 --> 39:42.359
I wanted to tell you,
but I wanted you to know me first.

39:42.360 --> 39:46.559
You wanted me to fall for you first!

39:46.560 --> 39:50.799
I didn't do it.
If you need me to, I can prove it.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.720
I didn't do it, Kel.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.200
I couldn't...

39:57.240 --> 39:59.360
But even you thought I could.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.360
Even you.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.960
I'll be at the bus stop.

40:11.640 --> 40:14.519
Corner of Muirfield Avenue

40:14.520 --> 40:17.560
and Lytton Street - nine o'clock.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.879
I want to start again.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.280
New life...

40:24.200 --> 40:26.199
with someone I love.

40:26.200 --> 40:31.639
Someone I never thought
I'd have the luck to come across.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.399
It's a lot to think about, I know,

40:33.400 --> 40:36.840
and I would've done it sooner if
all this hadn't have happened, but...

40:39.640 --> 40:41.599
I love you

40:41.600 --> 40:43.960
and I want you with me.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.600
Well, maybe you'll get one
if you're lucky.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.680
One, two, three, go!

42:49.120 --> 42:50.720
I've not seen you.

43:39.880 --> 43:41.199
Fuck!

43:41.200 --> 43:44.879
'I used to wonder how I'd know
if it was love and not lust.

43:44.880 --> 43:46.399
'How you could tell?

43:46.400 --> 43:49.559
'Because in the past, I thought
it was there and it wasn't.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.278
'It was nice, don't get me wrong,

43:51.279 --> 43:53.720
'but it wasn't what
it should've been.

43:53.721 --> 43:56.759
'It didn't feel like
it should've felt.

43:56.760 --> 43:59.399
'If just the thought of them
doesn't warm you,

43:59.400 --> 44:02.559
'if being with them at the end
of the day isn't all you need,

44:02.560 --> 44:06.439
'if you're not counting the hours
until you see them again,

44:06.440 --> 44:09.199
'if you don't keep
their old messages on your phone,

44:09.200 --> 44:11.160
'just so you can hear that voice,

44:11.161 --> 44:13.799
'then, it's not love.'

45:03.720 --> 45:05.679
I need every single one of you

45:05.680 --> 45:08.159
to start pulling in
some serious money!

45:08.160 --> 45:09.600
I've got me community service.

45:09.601 --> 45:12.799
He's doing drama and plays and that.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.879
I think there's been a mistake.

45:14.880 --> 45:17.079
Been years since I did a burglary.

45:17.080 --> 45:18.918
It was always a bit
of a turn-on for me.

45:18.919 --> 45:20.000
You're gay!

45:20.001 --> 45:22.799
Don't say 'owt, will you?

45:22.800 --> 45:25.359
We won't say a word either.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.560
You never go bareback.

45:26.561 --> 45:29.239
It wasn't business, it was Marty.

45:29.240 --> 45:32.079
Going to have to do a bit more
than kissing to make him sweet.

45:32.080 --> 45:36.119
Mary's giving Joseph a blow job?

45:36.120 --> 45:37.998
I kind of liked
having you by me side.

45:37.999 --> 45:39.038
We should make it more permanent.

45:39.039 --> 45:40.158
You having a laugh?

45:40.159 --> 45:41.480
Will you marry me?

46:19.560 --> 46:22.520

For fuck's sake, Mam!

46:39.240 --> 46:41.640
Is that gastric band
playing up again?
