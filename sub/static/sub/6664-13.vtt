WEBVTT

00:00.066 --> 00:02.735
Adult adam: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> stand-up comedy exploded.</i>

00:02.737 --> 00:05.804
<i> We'd spent hours watching</i>
<i> the greats like sam kinison,</i>

00:05.806 --> 00:07.406
<i> Garry shandling,</i>
<i> billy crystal,</i>

00:07.408 --> 00:09.775
<i> And my personal favorite...</i>
(all laughing)

00:09.777 --> 00:10.676
<i> The diceman.</i>

00:10.678 --> 00:12.511
I can't believe
he said that!

00:12.513 --> 00:13.312
I know!
(laughs)

00:13.314 --> 00:14.813
Adult adam: <i> They weren't</i>
<i> just my heroes.</i>

00:14.815 --> 00:16.315
<i> They were my inspirations.</i>

00:16.317 --> 00:20.686
<i> Sure, I never stood</i>
<i> in front of a red brick</i>
<i> wall with a microphone.</i>

00:20.688 --> 00:21.320
(all gasp)

00:21.322 --> 00:24.723
<i> But I still fancied myself</i>
<i> quite the comedian.</i>

00:24.725 --> 00:26.125
Nothing but rim.

00:26.127 --> 00:26.959
(all laughing)

00:26.961 --> 00:30.129
<i> Yep, I wasn't afraid to get</i>
<i> my hands dirty to get a laugh.</i>

00:30.131 --> 00:31.430
Oh, you got
a little something.

00:31.432 --> 00:32.531
Uh, right here?

00:32.533 --> 00:34.099
Right here.
Oh, right...Right...

00:34.101 --> 00:34.800
Right here, yeah.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.368
(all laughing)
adult adam:
<i> And I knew one day,</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:39.304
<i> I'd get the get the ultimate</i>
<i> achievement in comedy...</i>
<i> Class clown.</i>

00:39.306 --> 00:41.106
Sorry I'm late.
Yearbook is killing me.

00:41.108 --> 00:42.107
Here, let me carry
that for you.

00:42.109 --> 00:45.310
So you can see who's
getting voted class clown?
Nice try.

00:45.312 --> 00:47.046
Please.
Just let me see it.

00:47.048 --> 00:48.914
For your sugar bear?

00:48.916 --> 00:50.949
(sighs)
just take it.

00:52.118 --> 00:54.319
Yes! I got best
hair on a man.

00:54.321 --> 00:57.222
Oh, yeah. (chuckles)
shut up,
dave kim.

00:57.224 --> 01:00.426
Read it and weep.
I am...

01:00.428 --> 01:03.562
Adult adam: <i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> I got the opposite of that.</i>

01:03.564 --> 01:06.031
"nicest guy"?
Are you fricking
kidding me?

01:06.033 --> 01:07.800
What?
It's a good thing.
Dave kim: No, it's not.

01:07.802 --> 01:12.838
"nicest guy" is code for
"boring guy who just
has okay hair."

01:12.840 --> 01:14.506
(school bell rings)

01:14.508 --> 01:16.575
So, who's getting
class clown?

01:16.577 --> 01:17.309
Better not be mike levy

01:17.311 --> 01:19.945
'cause he didn't
choose for milk
to come out of his nose.

01:19.947 --> 01:22.181
He has a deviated septum.
So lucky.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.483
David sirota...
By a landslide.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.384
Are you kidding me?

01:25.386 --> 01:28.454
People think that putz
is funnier than me?

01:28.588 --> 01:30.389
(makes farting noise)

01:30.391 --> 01:31.723
(students laughing)
woodburn: Okay.

01:31.725 --> 01:34.726
Whoever's doing that,
just stop it!
Just stop right now.

01:34.728 --> 01:37.496
David sirota isn't funny.
He's ridiculous.

01:37.498 --> 01:40.599
Always dancing in the halls
and talking trash at gym.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.202
And this bit
with mr. Woodburn...

01:43.204 --> 01:43.936
Amateur hour.

01:43.938 --> 01:46.538
Everyone knows
making poots is cheap.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.906
(makes farting noise)

01:47.908 --> 01:49.741
(students laughing)

01:49.743 --> 01:51.176
I am an adult
and an educator,

01:51.178 --> 01:52.945
And I command you
to stop right now

01:52.947 --> 01:55.581
In the name
of stephen hawking.
Just stop it!

01:55.583 --> 01:56.915
Is sirota
funnier than me?

01:56.917 --> 01:59.084
For sure, bro.
You're not funny.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.419
Of course, I am!
It's a fact.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.888
Like africa's hot
or the sun sets
in the west.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.123
I don't know
about that stuff,

02:04.125 --> 02:06.358
But I definitely know
you're not funny.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.893
Erica,
back me up here.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.062
I'd like to,
but barry's right.

02:10.064 --> 02:11.563
You use comedy
as a defense mechanism,

02:11.565 --> 02:14.099
But that
doesn't make you
a funny person

02:14.101 --> 02:15.033
That people laugh with.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.669
It makes you a lame-o
that people laugh at.

02:17.671 --> 02:18.370
But funny's my thing.

02:18.372 --> 02:22.708
I mean, I'm not
an athlete or a brain
or a theater star.

02:22.710 --> 02:26.578
So, if I'm not funny,
what am I?

02:26.580 --> 02:27.546
You're really nice.

02:27.548 --> 02:28.647
Stop saying that!

02:28.649 --> 02:32.551
I'm funny, and there's
nothing you or anyone
else can say

02:32.553 --> 02:33.652
That can change my mind.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.453
That's right, squishy.

02:34.455 --> 02:38.223
I think you are
the funniest boy in
the whole wide world.

02:38.225 --> 02:39.791
(kissing)

02:39.793 --> 02:40.893
We rest our case.

02:40.895 --> 02:42.895
You're a wild
and crazy guy!

02:42.897 --> 02:45.964
Again,
we rest our case.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.299
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:47.301 --> 02:51.303
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:53.273 --> 02:54.573
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:54.575 --> 02:58.443
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:58.445 --> 03:01.580
Adult adam: <i> It was</i>
<i> may 10, 1980, something,</i>
<i> and my dad was pondering</i>

03:01.582 --> 03:04.616
<i> The number-one issue</i>
<i> plaguing all fathers.</i>

03:04.618 --> 03:05.417
Okay, I'm going
to lainey's.

03:05.419 --> 03:08.020
Not so fast!
You didn't fill up
the car last night.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.856
I want a full tank
when you get home,
no excuses!

03:10.858 --> 03:14.326
Adult adam: <i> Like all dads,</i>
<i> mine was obsessed</i>
<i> with the gas tank.</i>

03:14.328 --> 03:16.094
I drove the car
this morning.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.095
There's a ton
of gas in it.

03:17.097 --> 03:19.565
All right, let's take
a walk, shall we?

03:19.567 --> 03:22.434
Look at the gas gauge!
Look at it!

03:22.436 --> 03:23.669
Yeah, so?
It's half full.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.337
Which is as good
as empty!

03:25.339 --> 03:26.305
Ugh, not this again!

03:26.307 --> 03:29.341
We never break
the half-a-tank threshold.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.475
My car, my rules!

03:30.477 --> 03:32.778
Fine, then I'll just
walk everywhere
(clicking)

03:32.780 --> 03:35.647
For the rest of my life!
(garage door opening)

03:37.850 --> 03:41.019
Ho, ho! Yeah, go out
walking in that.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.488
Adult adam:
<i> This is how it went</i>
<i> with my dad and my sis.</i>

03:43.490 --> 03:45.924
<i> They were the two most</i>
<i> stubborn people on the planet.</i>

03:45.926 --> 03:49.428
I told you, no chewing gum
with your braces!

03:49.430 --> 03:52.297
God, it's just a pinch!
I can do what I want!

03:52.299 --> 03:53.065
My gum, my rules.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.601
Adult adam:
<i> Yep, the tiniest of arguments</i>
<i> could last months.</i>

03:55.603 --> 03:59.538
<i> Both had to win, and neither</i>
<i> would ever back down.</i>

03:59.540 --> 04:00.405
Ha! I win!

04:00.407 --> 04:02.708
Adult adam: <i> Even if it meant</i>
<i> going to the hospital</i>

04:02.710 --> 04:05.744
<i> With a bubble gum</i>
<i> related injury.</i>

04:05.746 --> 04:06.578
Erica, please.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.846
There might be
lightning outside.

04:07.848 --> 04:12.584
Good. I would rather
get struck by a bolt
of red-hot sky fire

04:12.586 --> 04:14.019
Than cave to his
stupid will.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.388
Okay, you know what?
I'll fill up the tank.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.291
No. You got to
back me up on this.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.525
My car, my rules.

04:20.527 --> 04:23.161
I support you on
every stupid little thing.

04:23.163 --> 04:27.165
You mean sit in your chair
and blindly yell,
"listen to your mother"?

04:27.167 --> 04:28.533
Exactly.
No.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.369
Do not back him
up on this.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.804
He is wrong,
and you know it.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.439
Just do what
your father says.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.475
I can't deal
with you people!

04:36.477 --> 04:38.343
Adult adam: <i> It seemed</i>
<i> round one went to erica.</i>

04:38.345 --> 04:40.012
(thunder rumbling)
(erica screams)

04:40.014 --> 04:42.814
God, I can't wait
to get out of this house

04:42.816 --> 04:43.515
And get away from you!

04:43.517 --> 04:46.785
Adult adam: <i> But actually,</i>
<i> round one went to my dad.</i>

04:46.787 --> 04:50.489
And that
is how you parent.

04:50.491 --> 04:54.459
Man, barry and erica
have really got
in my head.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.027
Am I unfunny?

04:55.029 --> 04:57.262
Are people laughing
at me, not with me?

04:57.264 --> 05:01.566
Absolutely not.
You've got your
sense of humor from me,

05:01.568 --> 05:04.136
And I'm hilarious.

05:04.337 --> 05:06.772
<i> ¶ my girlfriend had a kitty</i>

05:06.774 --> 05:10.342
<i> ¶ she came</i>
<i> from kansas city ¶</i>
oh, my god, stop.

05:10.810 --> 05:11.977
Hilarious.
(chuckles)

05:11.979 --> 05:12.978
But I still need
to find a way

05:12.980 --> 05:15.647
To beat david sirota
for class clown.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.715
Well, then,
let me help.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.017
You know,
when I was your age,

05:19.019 --> 05:21.620
I was busboying
in the catskills.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.422
I saw all the greats.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.489
Really? Like who?

05:24.491 --> 05:28.293
Harry 'bottles' mcnaughton,
stubby kaye,

05:28.295 --> 05:29.227
The kippleman brothers.

05:29.229 --> 05:32.197
One would talk and then
the other one would talk,

05:32.199 --> 05:33.999
And then the first one
would talk.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.234
Their act
was actually just okay.

05:36.236 --> 05:38.603
Yeah, it doesn't sound
very current.

05:38.605 --> 05:41.173
But I've, like,
memorized tons of jokes

05:41.175 --> 05:42.641
From all my
favorite comedians.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.043
Maybe I can bring
some of their stuff
into school.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.612
Yes. Let others
do the work for you.

05:47.614 --> 05:50.282
Adult adam: <i> And so,</i>
<i> I pulled out all the greats.</i>

05:50.284 --> 05:51.016
Great wall of china!

05:51.018 --> 05:54.052
Adult adam:
<i> First, sam kinison.</i>
(screaming) say it! Say it!

05:54.054 --> 05:54.986
(screaming)

05:54.988 --> 05:58.390
Adult adam:
<i> And then, I sprinkled</i>
<i> in a little gallagher.</i>

05:58.392 --> 05:59.591
<i> And then finish them off</i>

05:59.593 --> 06:02.427
<i> With a classic poem</i>
<i> by andrew dice clay.</i>

06:02.429 --> 06:05.230
"old mother hubbard
went to the cupboard

06:05.232 --> 06:06.798
"to get her dog a bone

06:06.800 --> 06:10.168
"when she (bleep)
rover took over

06:10.170 --> 06:12.170
"and gave her a (bleep)

06:12.172 --> 06:13.505
"oh!"

06:13.507 --> 06:15.474
Go to your room!

06:15.476 --> 06:16.341
(sighs)

06:16.343 --> 06:19.144
I'm sorry I yelled
and punished you.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.046
Yeah, I hadn't
seen that side
of you before.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.582
I just don't
understand how
you could say

06:23.584 --> 06:25.984
Those horrible things
about old mother hubbard.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.986
That's her dog.
They're friends.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.756
I guess barry and erica
are right. I'm not funny.

06:30.758 --> 06:33.325
Pal, you're funny,
but comedy is personal.

06:33.327 --> 06:37.195
Think of jokes
from your world,
stuff you know about.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.131
You think?
Of course.

06:39.133 --> 06:41.500
Take my favorite
comedian, don rickles.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.336
He tells jokes about
the people in his world,

06:44.338 --> 06:46.605
And he keeps
it personal.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.173
Keep it personal.
Yeah.

06:48.175 --> 06:52.944
Yeah. I think
that could work.
Thanks, pops.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.346
Anytime.

06:54.348 --> 06:58.183
Old mother hubbard
just wanted to feed
her poor dog, and he...

06:58.185 --> 06:59.985
Got to let it go, man.
Got to let it go.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.254
Adult adam: <i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i> erica had a plan on</i>
<i> how to defeat my dad,</i>

07:02.256 --> 07:07.392
<i> And it required stirring up</i>
<i> the most easily stirred-up</i>
<i> person on the planet.</i>

07:07.394 --> 07:10.695
Damn it!
I'm so mad at dad!

07:10.697 --> 07:11.396
Aren't you mad?

07:11.398 --> 07:13.999
No. Why? Should I be?
What did he do now?

07:14.001 --> 07:16.034
Well, he's always saying,
"my car, my rules,"

07:16.036 --> 07:19.638
And forcing us to
fill up his gas tank
like we're his slaves.

07:19.640 --> 07:23.842
He is always talking
about that stupid gas!

07:23.844 --> 07:25.610
It makes me very angry.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.511
Well, we can
fight back.

07:26.513 --> 07:29.448
I say we pool
our money together
and buy our own ride.

07:29.450 --> 07:33.452
That way, dad can never
say "my car, my rules"
ever again.

07:33.454 --> 07:34.653
Yes! Let's fight!

07:34.655 --> 07:36.388
God, I have so much rage
in my body right now.

07:36.390 --> 07:39.791
Well, let's do this.
I only have 60 bucks.
How much you got?

07:39.793 --> 07:44.129
Oh, I have to move
some stuff around
but roughly 1200.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.397
Dollars? How?

07:45.399 --> 07:48.200
Basically, you've
inherited dad's
stubbornness,

07:48.202 --> 07:49.801
And I inherited
his cheapness.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.838
You see,
every day for lunch,
mom gives me $2.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.639
I spend 25 cents
on chocolate milk

07:54.641 --> 07:58.376
And eat food scraps
off friends' plates
and random tables.

07:58.378 --> 07:59.277
We can get
any car we want.

07:59.279 --> 08:02.814
See? Right here.
Look at this sweet
little cabriolet.

08:02.816 --> 08:03.281
No, no, no!

08:03.283 --> 08:06.718
It's my cash,
and I know exactly
what we're buying.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.687
Erica: A crappy van?
Better.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.089
Adult adam: <i> Better, indeed.</i>
<i> Like every kid back then,</i>

08:11.091 --> 08:12.791
<i> Barry dreamed of being</i>
<i> part of</i> the a-team.

08:12.793 --> 08:15.794
<i> They were soldiers of fortune</i>
<i> who drove the toughest,</i>
<i> most badass,</i>

08:15.796 --> 08:18.129
<i> Most red-striped ride</i>
<i> to ever hit the road.</i>

08:18.131 --> 08:21.500
Barry, we are not buying
<i> the a-team</i> van.
It's not happening.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.836
Oh, it's happening,
and I'll be hannibal
'cause I'm the smart one.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.507
We're getting my
sporty little soft-top,
understand?

08:28.509 --> 08:29.140
End of discussion.

08:29.142 --> 08:32.677
Adult adam: <i> And with that,</i>
<i> barry did exactly</i>
<i> what he wanted.</i>

08:32.679 --> 08:33.578
<i> He bought the van.</i>

08:33.580 --> 08:35.213
(theme from
<i> the a-team</i> playing)

08:35.215 --> 08:37.148
Barry:
<i> ¶ duh-duh, duh, duh</i>

08:37.150 --> 08:38.350
<i> ¶ duh-duh, duh</i>

08:38.352 --> 08:40.519
<i> ¶ duh, duh-duh</i>
<i> duh, duh</i>

08:40.521 --> 08:41.786
<i> ¶ duh,</i>
<i> duh-duh-duh, duh ¶</i>

08:41.788 --> 08:44.823
(tires squealing)
erica: Stop sign!
That's a stop sign!

08:44.825 --> 08:45.891
Barry: Whoo!

08:45.893 --> 08:46.992
What's that smell?

08:46.994 --> 08:48.960
The smell of action.

08:50.730 --> 08:53.164
(tires squealing)

08:54.967 --> 08:56.368
What the hell
is this thing?

08:56.370 --> 08:59.838
Freedom.
My van, my rules.

08:59.840 --> 09:00.639
Whoo!

09:00.641 --> 09:03.475
This is why
I eat garbage.

09:06.846 --> 09:09.781
Adult adam: <i> In the standoff of</i>
<i> stubbornness with my dad,</i>

09:09.783 --> 09:12.684
<i> Erica had taken</i>
<i> the upper hand.</i>

09:12.686 --> 09:14.819
What's wrong with you?

09:14.821 --> 09:16.187
Who buys a crap van

09:16.189 --> 09:18.089
With bald tires,
a broken headlight,

09:18.091 --> 09:21.092
And look,
it's leaking oil
on my driveway.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.061
It's even
worse in here.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.362
No way!

09:24.364 --> 09:26.531
You're not driving this.
It's a death trap.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.867
Forget about driving it.
They're not keeping it.

09:28.869 --> 09:32.203
Oh, yes, we are.
Face it. I won.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.071
My van, my rules.

09:33.073 --> 09:37.776
Oh, that's too bad,
because it's
my house, my rules.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.077
House trumps van.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.479
You can't do that.
You can't just
change the rules.

09:41.481 --> 09:45.650
Well, that is a valid point,
but, uh, tough crap.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.719
This isn't fair.
We paid for it.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.054
Paid for it!
With our own money.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.156
Money!
And if it's your house,
your rules,

09:51.158 --> 09:53.425
Then we'll just move out
and live in the van.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.161
Live in a van!
Wait, what?

09:56.163 --> 09:57.228
Don't think of it
as a van.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.864
Think of it as
a studio apartment
of freedom.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.600
I don't think
I can agree
to live in a van.

10:01.602 --> 10:02.334
Well,
I love this idea.

10:02.336 --> 10:06.204
Murray, no!
Our babies
can't live in a van.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.906
They could get snatched
by a kidnapper

10:07.908 --> 10:09.040
Who wouldn't need
a creepy van,

10:09.042 --> 10:12.010
Because he's
being conveniently
provided with one.

10:12.012 --> 10:12.877
But none of that matters

10:12.879 --> 10:16.247
'cause you completely
back me up, right?

10:16.249 --> 10:17.048
(scoffs)

10:17.050 --> 10:18.850
Blindly and without
question?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.418
Fine,
I'll back you up.

10:20.420 --> 10:25.323
Even though I did make
cobbler a la mode
for dessert tonight.

10:25.325 --> 10:28.693
Ohhh! That's french talk
for "pie and ice cream."

10:28.695 --> 10:31.029
Stay with me,
and I'll let you
paint a red stripe.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.897
How does that sound,
hannibal?

10:32.899 --> 10:35.934
Erica wins! She called me
the tv character I like.

10:35.936 --> 10:39.204
Adult adam:
<i> Both erica and my dad</i>
<i> refused to stand down,</i>

10:39.206 --> 10:42.040
<i> So I decided to lighten the</i>
<i> mood with a little stand-up.</i>

10:42.042 --> 10:42.941
Hello, there, everybody.

10:42.943 --> 10:46.011
Seemed like it
was a good time
for a little comedy.

10:46.013 --> 10:46.778
No, thank you.
Go away.

10:46.780 --> 10:51.249
So, I hear erica
is gonna be hanging out
in the back of a van.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.551
Or as she likes
to call it,

10:53.553 --> 10:54.953
A typical Saturday night.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.388
Zing!
What is this?

10:56.390 --> 10:58.556
And, of course,
there's my mom.

10:58.558 --> 11:01.693
Always saying,
"I have failed as a mother."

11:01.695 --> 11:02.260
Crazy, right?

11:02.262 --> 11:03.895
Although, if you
think about it,

11:03.897 --> 11:05.997
Two of her kids
are living in a van,

11:05.999 --> 11:08.566
And the other one's
gone into comedy.

11:08.568 --> 11:09.734
Ay-oh!

11:09.736 --> 11:10.702
What is this?

11:10.704 --> 11:12.470
And look...
There's the mur-man.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.939
My dad is such
a slothful sack of crap,

11:14.941 --> 11:18.977
Even his armchair's like,
"really? Again?"

11:18.979 --> 11:20.445
What the hell is this?

11:20.447 --> 11:22.280
I bombed.
See, the problem here

11:22.282 --> 11:25.250
Is you horribly
misinterpreted
my advice.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.819
You said, "do rickles."
I did rickles!

11:27.821 --> 11:31.823
No, I said come up
with personal material
like rickles,

11:31.825 --> 11:37.028
Not do insult jokes
about your family
to your family.

11:37.030 --> 11:37.729
The good news is,

11:37.731 --> 11:39.798
You had no problem
coming up
with the funny.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.033
Now all you
got to do is find
the right audience.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.569
Really? You think
if I come up with
something big,

11:44.571 --> 11:46.771
I still have a shot
at class clown?

11:46.773 --> 11:48.406
Absolutely.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.276
Now, don't misinterpret
my advice again.

11:51.278 --> 11:54.312
Don't be hurtful.
Just be funny.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.580
I 100% got it.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.648
Adult adam: <i> But I didn't.</i>

11:56.650 --> 11:58.216
<i> Desperate for an easy laugh,</i>
<i> I iced a hat box</i>

11:58.218 --> 12:04.723
<i> To give to my overly</i>
<i> sensitive science teacher,</i>
<i> and it would be epic.</i>

12:04.725 --> 12:08.026
What's this?
It's not even my birthday.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.762
Trust me.
You deserve this.
(chuckles)

12:10.764 --> 12:12.897
So, you just...

12:13.399 --> 12:14.632
Wow.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.634
You don't know
how much
this means to me.

12:16.636 --> 12:19.437
I...I honestly thought
about quitting this job.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.106
I thought you kids
didn't care about science.

12:21.108 --> 12:26.177
But this cake
means the world to me,
changes everything.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.712
Thank you so much, adam.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.347
My new life starts today!

12:29.349 --> 12:32.717
Who wants a piece?
(thudding)

12:35.354 --> 12:36.154
(metal clatters)

12:36.156 --> 12:39.491
We're looking at what?
A mean-spirited prank?

12:39.493 --> 12:41.426
Pretty much.

12:41.660 --> 12:42.127
Okay, then.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.429
Everyone read chapter six.
I'll be in my office.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.697
I need some
time to think.

12:45.699 --> 12:47.532
(door opens)
do not knock on this door.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.135
Dude,
that was brutal.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.504
Come on, guys.
It was a joke.

12:52.506 --> 12:53.738
It's me,
the class clown.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.875
It's not official,
but it could be,
right, guys?

12:56.877 --> 12:59.310
I don't know
what that was,
but it was mean.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.178
Well,
at the very least,

13:00.180 --> 13:01.880
Maybe now,
I won't be voted
nicest guy.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.849
Just so you know,
I was the one
who nominated you.

13:04.851 --> 13:05.550
What? Why?

13:05.552 --> 13:08.086
Why not? Since when
is being nice a bad thing?

13:08.088 --> 13:09.154
Since we're in
middle school.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.890
It's basically
the worst thing you
can say about a dude.

13:11.892 --> 13:15.660
Not to me.
Everyone is always
trying to be funny or cool

13:15.662 --> 13:17.128
Or someone they're not.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.898
The last thing I want
is to be with some clown.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.933
I just want
to be with you.

13:21.935 --> 13:22.600
Or at least, I did.

13:22.602 --> 13:26.704
Adult adam: <i> I was no longer</i>
<i> the class clown or</i>
<i> the nicest guy in school,</i>

13:26.706 --> 13:27.539
<i> And it felt awful.</i>

13:27.541 --> 13:31.643
<i> Meanwhile, erica and barry</i>
<i> were feeling even worse</i>

13:31.645 --> 13:32.477
<i> In their stinky new home</i>

13:32.479 --> 13:35.713
<i> Adorned with a poorly</i>
<i> painted red stripe.</i>

13:35.715 --> 13:38.082
God, come on!
Would you quit moving?

13:38.084 --> 13:39.284
You keep kicking me
in the face!

13:39.286 --> 13:41.219
Hey, you're the one
who wanted to sleep
head-to-feet.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.155
Well, I am not sleeping
face-to-face with you.
It's super weird.

13:44.157 --> 13:48.593
No, what's super weird
is we're living
in a fricking van.

13:48.595 --> 13:51.162
Look at us.
We're van people.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.730
I don't want to be
van people.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.300
You should have
just filled up
his damn gas tank.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.101
Barry, this is not
about the gas.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.770
It's about
freedom, honor,

13:58.772 --> 14:01.172
And rubbing it
in dad's face
when I win.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.607
But how long
is that gonna take?

14:02.609 --> 14:03.508
Until he cracks.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.211
But dad's too stubborn,
and I'm too hungry.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.881
Can't I just sneak in
and grab a giant
hunk of brisket?

14:09.883 --> 14:10.415
No brisket!

14:10.417 --> 14:12.984
Our days of food
and comfort are over.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.286
This van is our
home now,

14:15.288 --> 14:18.256
And this canned tuna,
our brisket.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.424
Now eat it.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.327
(whimpers)
(sighs)

14:22.795 --> 14:23.494
Stop!

14:23.496 --> 14:24.662
I can't.
What are you doing?

14:24.664 --> 14:25.697
I'm tilting it.
You're tilting it!

14:25.699 --> 14:27.632
I don't belong
here, okay?
Stop tilting it!

14:27.634 --> 14:30.268
Just take it
outside!
Brisket!

14:31.837 --> 14:33.204
Psst.

14:33.839 --> 14:34.672
Mama.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.407
It's me, lovebug.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.609
What are you doing
out here?

14:37.611 --> 14:41.012
Eating tuna
and getting ready
to use the potty bush.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.213
I hate being van people.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.116
Shh. I brought you
a home-cooked meal.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.084
Oh!

14:46.086 --> 14:48.119
(grunting)
yes. Go to town.

14:48.121 --> 14:51.155
Good boy.
Like a little badger.

14:51.157 --> 14:52.390
(door opens)

14:52.392 --> 14:53.691
You.

14:53.693 --> 14:54.359
You.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.093
What is wrong
with you?

14:55.095 --> 14:56.394
You couldn't even
last one night?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.096
You were supposed to
back me up, bevy,

14:58.098 --> 15:00.798
And that doesn't mean
bringing the boy dinner.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.800
Dear lord, what did he
do to that corn?

15:02.802 --> 15:05.737
Well, I'm sick
of this, murray.
Adam was right.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.473
I have failed
as a mother, literally.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.876
Our children
are van people.

15:11.878 --> 15:12.810
Please end this.

15:12.812 --> 15:16.414
Fine. Barry, I will buy
your portion of the van,

15:16.416 --> 15:19.050
Full price,
in cash.
Deal!

15:19.052 --> 15:22.787
Boom!
My van, my rules! I win!

15:22.789 --> 15:25.623
You will never win.
You see this face?

15:25.625 --> 15:27.258
This is the face
of a winner.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.093
And I don't care
how long it takes.

15:29.095 --> 15:32.096
I will crush you
with the weight
of a thousand suns.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.866
Never! I will dowse
your suns

15:34.868 --> 15:37.268
With a thousand
buckets of water.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.737
Stop. I hate how
you two always do this.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.172
Me? It's his fault.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.607
No, it's both of you.

15:42.609 --> 15:46.144
You both think
you're so different,
but you're exactly the same.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.012
So, if you're not
gonna end this, I will.

15:48.014 --> 15:51.282
I demand that
you hug each other.

15:52.184 --> 15:55.386
Where are
the damn huggies?

15:56.288 --> 15:58.890
Adult adam: <i> Turns out</i>
<i> my fake cake for mr. Woodburn</i>

15:58.892 --> 16:00.892
<i> Got me in a very real</i>
<i> amount of trouble.</i>

16:00.894 --> 16:02.927
Thanks for coming.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.395
As you know,
adam's little joke

16:04.397 --> 16:08.333
Has sent mr. Woodburn
to a very dark
and horrible place.

16:08.335 --> 16:12.704
I can assure you,
adam is very sorry
for what he did.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.372
I'm really, really sorry.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.340
That's...That's fine.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.309
But we may be dealing
with larger issues here.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.612
When a nice boy
like adam acts out,

16:21.614 --> 16:24.048
It's usually because...

16:24.050 --> 16:25.249
Something's going on
at home.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.417
What are you saying,
earl?

16:26.419 --> 16:27.919
Well, I'm saying
it came to my attention

16:27.921 --> 16:30.888
That a couple
of your children
are van people.

16:30.890 --> 16:34.559
No, no, no. None of our
children are van people.
(scoffs)

16:34.561 --> 16:35.927
They tried
to live in a van,

16:35.929 --> 16:39.630
But those morons
didn't even make it
through the night.

16:39.632 --> 16:40.765
What my husband means

16:40.767 --> 16:43.634
Is that there was
a minor disagreement

16:43.636 --> 16:45.236
That resulted in our kids

16:45.238 --> 16:49.340
Briefly moving into
a carpeted vehicle.

16:49.808 --> 16:50.341
What you doing?

16:50.343 --> 16:51.976
Um, I'm just
taking some notes.

16:51.978 --> 16:55.446
It looks like a "v."
you better not be
writing "van people."

16:55.448 --> 16:58.449
I can confirm
that the "v"
is for "van."

16:58.451 --> 16:59.984
How dare you
question our parenting?

16:59.986 --> 17:03.621
I'll have you know
that we are very
loving and kind,

17:03.623 --> 17:05.423
And each one
of our little angels

17:05.425 --> 17:08.960
Cherishes every moment
spent in our home.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.895
(panting) there you are!

17:10.897 --> 17:11.929
Erica's at
the bus station.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.098
She told lainey
she's buying a ticket
to new york

17:14.100 --> 17:17.368
So she never
has to live in your
stupid house again.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.504
Adult adam: <i> True to her word,</i>

17:19.506 --> 17:22.940
<i> My sister went to new stubborn</i>
<i> heights by fleeing the state.</i>

17:22.942 --> 17:25.410
Beverly: We're
blocked in by a bus?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.178
How is that
even possible?

17:27.180 --> 17:28.246
It's a school!

17:28.248 --> 17:30.448
(sighs) we're never
gonna make it in time.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.116
Oh, yes, you will.

17:32.118 --> 17:35.920
(theme from
<i> the a-team</i> playing)
(brakes screeching)

17:35.922 --> 17:37.321
<i> ¶ duh-duh, duh, duh</i>

17:37.323 --> 17:39.090
Oh! Oh!
<i> ¶ ba, ba, ba ¶</i>

17:39.092 --> 17:40.291
Stop with that song!

17:40.293 --> 17:43.861
Shut up! I love you,
but shut up!

17:45.064 --> 17:47.799
(engine sputtering)

17:47.966 --> 17:51.669
(theme music slows down)
beverly: No, no, no, no,
no, not slower! Faster!

17:51.671 --> 17:53.104
Hit the gas, barry!

17:53.106 --> 17:56.574
What's happening?
Why isn't my
<i> a-team</i> van working?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.142
Murray: Look.
You ran out of gas.

17:58.144 --> 18:01.079
But there was
half a tank
this morning.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.513
Murray: Morons!

18:02.515 --> 18:06.284
Okay, we got to
mobilize and track
down my little girl.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.351
I'll call the police
and set up a roadblock.

18:07.353 --> 18:10.321
Murray, you call all
your new york city
furniture contacts.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.191
Honey,
she's right there.

18:13.725 --> 18:18.096
Ohhh! My little munchkin.
I got to go squeeze her.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.831
No, no, no, no.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.500
I think I should be
the one to talk to her.

18:22.502 --> 18:27.105
(bruce hornsby and the range's
<i> that's the way</i> it is playing)

18:27.973 --> 18:32.510
Well, if you were
trying to kill us
from worry,

18:32.512 --> 18:35.446
You're the big
winner here.

18:35.448 --> 18:35.980
No, you are.

18:35.982 --> 18:40.985
I know I always talk about
how much I hate this house
and your dumb rules.

18:40.987 --> 18:44.489
(sighs) but when
I actually got
a chance to go,

18:44.491 --> 18:45.123
I couldn't do it.

18:45.125 --> 18:48.759
Yeah. This one
really got away from us.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.729
I am so damn stubborn
that I almost ran away,

18:51.731 --> 18:53.564
Because I didn't want
to put gas in the car.

18:53.566 --> 18:57.635
All right.
So, you and me,
we don't back down.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.936
I don't see that
as a bad thing.

18:58.938 --> 19:02.373
You don't seriously
believe that, do you?
Oh, yeah.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.643
When I was your age,
I was a crappy student.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.646
There was this guidance
counselor who told me

19:08.648 --> 19:09.947
That I should
take up a trade

19:09.949 --> 19:13.651
'cause no college would
ever take a guy like me.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.186
So out of spite,

19:15.188 --> 19:17.221
I worked my butt off.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.656
I got into penn state,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.391
And that's where
I met your mother.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.792
So, I literally
wouldn't be here

19:21.794 --> 19:24.362
If you weren't such
a pigheaded jerk?

19:24.364 --> 19:25.263
That is correct.

19:25.265 --> 19:29.500
And mark my words,
when you do finally
leave this house,

19:29.502 --> 19:32.603
The world
better watch out.

19:33.305 --> 19:34.305
(sighs)

19:34.307 --> 19:37.375
But give me
a few more years.

19:37.377 --> 19:40.645
I'm not ready
to let you
go just yet.

19:41.280 --> 19:45.183
Adult adam: <i> As my dad</i>
<i> and my sister finally</i>
<i> embraced who they were,</i>

19:45.185 --> 19:47.618
<i> I realized it was time</i>
<i> for me to do the same.</i>

19:47.620 --> 19:49.887
Mr. Woodburn,
I made you this.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.689
<i> ¶ 'cause the law don't</i>
<i> change another's mind ¶</i>

19:51.691 --> 19:54.225
I don't get it.
What's the joke?

19:54.227 --> 19:54.825
No joke.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.695
Just wanted to show
my favorite teacher

19:57.697 --> 19:58.696
That I'm sorry.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.865
Favorite? Wow.
Thank you.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.135
Adult adam: <i> 'cause in the end,</i>
<i> it's not about labels people</i>
<i> give you.</i>

20:04.137 --> 20:07.305
<i> It's about being okay</i>
<i> with who you really are.</i>

20:07.307 --> 20:08.172
That was nice, adam.

20:08.174 --> 20:10.341
Yeah, well, that's
what I was going for.

20:10.343 --> 20:13.477
Adult adam: <i> And I may not</i>
<i> have been the class clown,</i>

20:13.479 --> 20:14.278
<i> But lucky for me,</i>

20:14.280 --> 20:18.849
<i> Nice guys don't</i>
<i> always finish last.</i>

20:20.485 --> 20:23.054
(laughing)

20:28.994 --> 20:30.928
(ding)

20:38.637 --> 20:41.205
Please welcome david sirota!

20:41.207 --> 20:43.474
(inaudible)

20:43.842 --> 20:45.209
(inaudible)

20:45.211 --> 20:49.647
(adam, barry
and erica laughing)
(inaudible)

20:49.649 --> 20:50.114
(laughing)

20:50.116 --> 20:52.750
(tv turns off)
okay, enough
with this potty mouth

20:52.752 --> 20:53.484
In the leather trousers.

20:53.486 --> 20:57.321
I'm gonna show you
what funny was
back in my day.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.589
Pops:
<i> ¶ oh</i>

20:58.591 --> 21:01.993
<i> ¶ I took my new girl</i>
<i> to the fishing hole</i>

21:01.995 --> 21:05.029
<i> ¶ I gave her my jacket</i>
<i> 'cause she was cold</i>

21:05.031 --> 21:09.233
<i> ¶ I puckered my lips</i>
<i> I offered my tongue</i>

21:09.235 --> 21:11.135
<i> ¶ and that's when she said</i>

21:11.137 --> 21:13.237
<i> ¶ no, thank you</i>
<i> we're done ¶</i>

21:13.239 --> 21:14.672
Hey!

21:16.108 --> 21:17.775
That was...

21:18.043 --> 21:18.542
Good.

21:18.544 --> 21:21.279
Yeah, I liked
the part about the...

21:21.281 --> 21:23.748
What was it?
The fishing place?

21:23.750 --> 21:24.215
Hole.

21:24.217 --> 21:26.017
(chuckles)
he said "hole."

21:26.019 --> 21:28.286
(all laughing)
