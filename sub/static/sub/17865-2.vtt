in a room

19:58.039 --> 20:00.341
with a compromised
overmantle?

20:00.343 --> 20:03.276
Butternut's been ruined.

20:03.278 --> 20:05.013
One might say that the room
was ruined

20:05.015 --> 20:07.180
when you two spent three days
urinating and defecating in it.

20:07.182 --> 20:10.950
Sure doesn't smell like this
in the Lilac Fantasy Room.

20:10.952 --> 20:14.622
both: Lilac Fantasy Room.

20:14.624 --> 20:16.856
- No!
- [both grunting]

20:16.858 --> 20:19.259
- [chuckles]
- Get back!

20:19.261 --> 20:22.730
- No, no! I set you hence.
- [both grunting]

20:22.732 --> 20:26.066
- You're hurting me.
- [grunting]

20:26.068 --> 20:28.603
Mine!

20:28.605 --> 20:30.537
My clavicle.

20:30.539 --> 20:32.239
I was thinking about it.

20:32.241 --> 20:34.040
If that ragamuffin boy
had a third hatchet,

20:34.042 --> 20:35.809
he could have thrown his hatchet
at the one

20:35.811 --> 20:37.812
that careened off of Benjamin,
then they all would have hit

20:37.814 --> 20:39.980
each other and fallen
harmlessly at the same time.

20:39.982 --> 20:41.716
You're right.
It wasn't my fault.

20:41.718 --> 20:43.449
It was your family's fault
for not giving that orphan boy

20:43.451 --> 20:45.085
- more weaponry.
- I know.

20:45.087 --> 20:47.788
A hatchet in every hand.
It's just safer that way.

20:47.790 --> 20:49.990
Ahh! Ahh!

20:49.992 --> 20:51.927
[both screaming]

20:55.152 --> 20:58.000
