WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:02.820
I'm really looking for my boy.
Maybe you can help me.

00:02.859 --> 00:05.350
I knew I didn't like this place.

00:06.129 --> 00:08.256
Hey, guys. Maybe we can talk about this?

00:09.299 --> 00:12.325
He says he'll take us for a steak
and he brings us here.

00:12.368 --> 00:13.926
- You're a wrestler?
- Yeah.

00:13.970 --> 00:16.495
Mr. White Death, Doctor Of Destruction.

00:16.539 --> 00:19.633
- The Mag's putting me up.
- The Mag?

00:19.676 --> 00:23.635
I don't appreciate you harassing me.
The only father I ever knew is dead.

00:23.680 --> 00:27.138
Is he really looking for his son
or is he having me set somebody up?

00:27.183 --> 00:28.946
I want my boy!

02:12.789 --> 02:16.054
Hey, Signor Marchese,
what a pleasure to see ya.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.424
How you doin', Joey?

02:18.461 --> 02:20.986
Hey, I'm doin', I'm doin'.

02:21.030 --> 02:24.329
Have a seat, signor, no waiting.
Make yourself comfortable.

02:24.367 --> 02:25.664
OK.

02:25.701 --> 02:28.329
Just, you know... gimme the usual.

02:29.338 --> 02:31.772
You've got it, signor, you've got it.

02:32.642 --> 02:36.373
Say, you see the Gianelli fight
Saturday night?

02:36.412 --> 02:38.073
No, I missed it.

02:38.114 --> 02:41.413
That bum went down. In the tank.

02:41.451 --> 02:43.112
Yeah, I heard.

02:43.152 --> 02:46.781
You didn't miss much.
You didn't miss a thing.

02:46.823 --> 02:50.418
Well, I've been down in Havana
for the last two weeks...

02:50.460 --> 02:52.121
on business.

02:52.161 --> 02:55.221
Those boys, those boys know how to live.

02:55.264 --> 03:00.201
I mean they really got a handle on
what life's all about, you know what I mean?

03:01.404 --> 03:03.133
Hey.

03:03.172 --> 03:04.833
You oughta go, Joey.

03:04.874 --> 03:07.468
I mean, I got a casino, I got a hotel.

03:08.644 --> 03:11.477
I'd get you all the broads
and all the rum you can use.

03:11.514 --> 03:14.677
It's on me.
Go ahead, it'll make you feel young again.

03:14.717 --> 03:17.618
Yeah, yeah.

03:20.389 --> 03:24.587
Excuse a moment, I'm out of tonic,
I gotta go in the back room.

03:24.627 --> 03:26.822
OK, all right. Make it quick.

03:26.863 --> 03:29.889
I'll be right back. It's your favorite kind.

03:32.034 --> 03:37.597
90 miles, I mean, what the hell? It's a nice trip
and it'll do you a world of good.

03:42.378 --> 03:43.367
Joey?

03:44.514 --> 03:45.538
Mm!

03:45.581 --> 03:47.412
This shave's on Dominic.

03:48.151 --> 03:49.812
You remember him, Sal?

03:49.852 --> 03:51.683
He's a good friend of yours.

04:00.930 --> 04:03.660
- Wait here. I'll be right back.
- Yeah, anything you say.

04:03.699 --> 04:07.260
He says he'll take us for a steak
and he brings us here.

04:14.877 --> 04:16.538
Bet you the beef here bites back.

04:16.579 --> 04:19.207
Just gimme a minute.
I've gotta talk to a guy.

04:19.248 --> 04:21.944
Then we'll go to the steakhouse, OK?
Enjoy the show.

04:21.983 --> 04:23.451
The show?

04:33.930 --> 04:36.125
You owe me five big ones, Harry.

04:36.165 --> 04:40.226
- I know. You'll get it.
- You've been telling me that for six months.

04:40.269 --> 04:43.295
Come on, buddy. I'm a little bit short.

04:43.339 --> 04:47.105
Come on, Harry. I look around,
it looks like you're doing real well here.

04:49.245 --> 04:53.079
A debt's a debt and I don't wanna get stiffed.
You got it?

04:53.115 --> 04:54.639
Who's talking stiff?

04:58.020 --> 05:01.251
Ladies and gentlemen, time has run out.

05:01.290 --> 05:06.455
We have a decision in this match
between Big Zongo, The Fire God Of Bali,

05:06.495 --> 05:08.827
and the contender from New Jersey,

05:08.864 --> 05:12.300
Mr. White Death, The Doctor Of Destruction,

05:12.335 --> 05:14.599
The Surgeon Of Pain.

05:14.637 --> 05:16.195
This match...

05:16.239 --> 05:17.467
it's a draw!

05:17.506 --> 05:18.905
What?

05:18.941 --> 05:23.503
Oh, I can't bel... A draw?
My man definitely had that man down there.

05:26.916 --> 05:28.577
Break it up. Come on.

05:28.618 --> 05:30.176
Come on.

05:34.023 --> 05:37.550
Don't press me.
You're on my turf now, huh?

05:38.494 --> 05:42.828
I know, Harry.
That's why I brought a couple of my friends.

05:44.967 --> 05:46.958
You shouldn't have done that.

05:57.313 --> 06:00.805
Are you nuts? What are you...? Take it easy.

06:10.860 --> 06:12.521
What's going on here?

06:12.561 --> 06:16.156
- <i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>...
- I knew I didn't like this place.

06:16.198 --> 06:19.463
<i>In this corner, Come On, I Wanna Kill Ya</i>.

06:19.502 --> 06:22.665
Hey, guys. Maybe we can talk about this.

06:27.343 --> 06:30.904
- Will you have a beer?
- Sure. Good idea.

06:36.752 --> 06:38.413
Tomorrow.

06:40.489 --> 06:41.979
Hey. That ain't fair!

07:03.245 --> 07:04.906
That takes care of that.

07:06.148 --> 07:08.776
- Thanks.
- I just didn't like the odds.

07:12.188 --> 07:14.213
Steak dinner! Turkey!

07:16.125 --> 07:18.685
That's some uppercut you've got, pal.

07:19.428 --> 07:20.895
Thanks.

07:20.930 --> 07:23.558
- My name's Earl.
- Thomas Magnum.

07:23.599 --> 07:25.897
- T.C.
- Rick.

07:26.469 --> 07:28.232
Thanks for helping us out.

07:28.270 --> 07:30.295
Maybe you can do the same for me someday.

07:30.339 --> 07:31.328
Sure.

07:31.374 --> 07:35.037
How about right now?
I'm hungry. Let's go get some sushi.

07:38.280 --> 07:43.115
- Actually, we were going out for steaks.
- Come on, sushi's better for you.

07:43.152 --> 07:44.483
Well...

07:44.520 --> 07:45.748
OK. Great.

07:45.788 --> 07:47.119
Er...

07:47.156 --> 07:50.421
He won't be doing more than vanilla malts
for the next two days.

07:50.459 --> 07:54.657
You two go ahead.
I've kinda lost my appetite.

07:55.531 --> 07:56.862
Guys!

07:57.366 --> 07:59.698
Hey! I'll be changed in a minute.

08:00.703 --> 08:02.364
Great.

08:03.372 --> 08:05.033
Great.

08:07.543 --> 08:10.569
Yeah. It was in Nagasaki, about '56, '57.

08:10.613 --> 08:13.173
I'm wrestling this big sumo wrestler.

08:13.215 --> 08:15.615
Now, you think I'm big. Woo-hoo!

08:15.651 --> 08:19.587
Just a little bit more.
Just put down a bit more. That's it.

08:19.622 --> 08:23.888
Now, this sumo wrestler
must have checked in at about 450.

08:23.926 --> 08:28.386
I mean, before breakfast.
Thanks a lot.

08:28.431 --> 08:32.457
Now, I'm playing the good part, you know,
Mr. White Death!

08:32.501 --> 08:36.904
- Doctor Of Destruction, Surgeon Of Pain.
- You got it. All right.

08:38.073 --> 08:40.097
Well, might just as well, eh?

08:43.145 --> 08:44.134
OK.

08:46.449 --> 08:48.280
So...

08:48.317 --> 08:51.252
Anyway, this sumo wrestler's
jumping up and down on me,

08:51.287 --> 08:53.881
but he ain't hurting me -
cinch stuff, you know.

08:53.923 --> 08:57.859
Then it comes my turn to trip him,
when he falls.

08:57.893 --> 09:01.021
Then I got him, you know, in a leg lock.
I'm giving it...

09:03.532 --> 09:05.591
It don't matter. I'll use a spoon.

09:07.069 --> 09:08.900
I got him in a leg lock, you see,

09:08.938 --> 09:12.965
and suddenly I noticed that the guy
ain't moving very much anymore.

09:13.008 --> 09:16.967
So I kinda lean back a little bit
to check him out,

09:17.012 --> 09:18.536
and I see this guy is dead.

09:18.581 --> 09:20.242
He had a heart attack.

09:20.449 --> 09:25.785
And here I am, sitting in the middle of a ring,
surrounded by 5,000 of his followers,

09:25.821 --> 09:28.187
and I got a dead sumo wrestler.

09:29.391 --> 09:31.552
- What happened?
- What happened?

09:31.594 --> 09:33.084
I'm scared to death, man.

09:33.128 --> 09:37.724
My heart is going like the Coney Island
Express and I got no more tokens.

09:37.766 --> 09:40.564
And then I look up
and I hear a lot of chanting going on,

09:40.603 --> 09:45.700
and they're saying something like...

09:48.744 --> 09:50.871
- What's that mean?
- What's it mean?

09:50.913 --> 09:52.676
It means, "Kill the jerk."

09:52.715 --> 09:53.545
Oh.

09:54.116 --> 09:56.550
"Oh" is right. And it could've been worse.

09:56.585 --> 09:59.748
But by the time the guys realized it's for real,

09:59.788 --> 10:02.689
the eighth army came in and got me out,
no problem.

10:05.127 --> 10:07.687
Oh, boy.

10:07.730 --> 10:09.391
Thank you.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.328
Thank you.

10:13.369 --> 10:15.030
Mm, good.

10:18.007 --> 10:20.999
So... what's your dodge, Mag?

10:21.043 --> 10:22.567
- My dodge?
- Mm.

10:22.611 --> 10:24.272
Oh, my dodge.

10:24.313 --> 10:26.713
- I'm a private investigator.
- A what?

10:26.749 --> 10:28.808
A private investigator.

10:28.851 --> 10:32.048
You gotta be kidding. A gumshoe?

10:33.322 --> 10:37.782
You know, this is really my lucky night.
You can really help me.

10:37.826 --> 10:39.817
I mean really help me in a big way.

10:40.663 --> 10:42.995
- I don't know...
- Wait a minute.

10:43.032 --> 10:46.195
You've just saved me
a long walk through the Yellow Pages.

10:46.235 --> 10:47.896
Now, let me tell you.

10:47.937 --> 10:51.100
You know, I've been all around this world

10:51.140 --> 10:54.940
and I've done a lot of things
that I would like to forget.

10:56.245 --> 11:00.944
And when you reach a certain age, you just
like to even things up, know what I mean?

11:01.850 --> 11:05.684
That's why I'm here, to even things up.
You see...

11:05.721 --> 11:07.712
I'm really looking for my boy.

11:08.524 --> 11:11.721
And... And maybe you can help me find him.

11:13.696 --> 11:15.357
His name's Phil.

11:15.965 --> 11:17.193
- Phil?
- Yeah.

11:18.834 --> 11:20.699
- How old is he?
- 36.

11:22.137 --> 11:24.162
Well, he's only ten there.

11:24.206 --> 11:27.903
Yeah. But you see,
I left him and his mother high and dry.

11:27.943 --> 11:30.844
You know,
one summer night on Brighton Beach...

11:32.548 --> 11:35.016
I ain't seen neither one of them since.

11:36.385 --> 11:40.082
- Are they here in Hawaii?
- Well, he is. Since '61.

11:42.391 --> 11:45.121
I just found out about it a month or so ago.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.788
Imagine, not seeing him all these years.

11:56.338 --> 11:58.329
I can see that look on your face.

12:00.376 --> 12:04.369
I know what you must be thinking,
but... I had reasons.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.071
Believe me, I had reasons.

12:08.817 --> 12:12.344
My wife is dead now
and all I got left is my son.

12:13.555 --> 12:17.047
Elaine, my wife,
married another guy out here

12:17.092 --> 12:21.119
and... and my boy took over his name, but...

12:22.164 --> 12:24.155
but that don't matter with me.

12:25.668 --> 12:29.365
I just wanna see him,
I just wanna see him one more time...

12:29.405 --> 12:32.533
if he'll see me. Will you help me?

12:35.277 --> 12:37.370
Well, it's not gonna be that easy.

12:37.946 --> 12:39.914
You can do it, Mag.

12:39.948 --> 12:41.381
Please, try, will you?

12:41.417 --> 12:45.444
You can find him. I don't even
want to talk to him, that ain't important.

12:45.487 --> 12:48.422
All I want to do is see him. Just see him.

12:52.795 --> 12:57.289
<i>I remember when I was five years old,
I found this little puppy in the street.</i>

12:57.332 --> 13:00.062
<i>It had been hit by a car
and was in pretty bad shape,</i>

13:00.102 --> 13:03.003
<i>so I brought it home
and my dad and I took it to the vet.</i>

13:03.038 --> 13:04.699
<i>120 bucks</i>.

13:04.740 --> 13:07.607
<i>The little puppy grew into a big St. Bernard</i>.

13:07.643 --> 13:10.612
<i>It ate a $500 couch
and my dad's favorite armchair.</i>

13:10.646 --> 13:13.376
<i>The next day, my dad put it in the backyard</i>

13:13.415 --> 13:16.782
<i>where it dug a hole through the fence
and ran away.</i>

13:16.819 --> 13:21.722
<i>Ever since then, I've been wary
about taking in big, adorable pups.</i>

13:21.757 --> 13:27.320
<i>One of life's lessons you just have
to keep learning, over and over again.</i>

13:28.097 --> 13:30.565
- I'll get my key and we'll go right up.
- Hey!

13:30.599 --> 13:33.159
- What?
- Mr. White Death.

13:33.202 --> 13:36.262
What do you mean, "what"?
You owe me six days.

13:36.305 --> 13:38.170
Well...

13:38.207 --> 13:42.337
Look, I told you, we don't get paid at the club
until Friday. Besides...

13:42.377 --> 13:46.143
Besides nothing. You don't even have a job.

13:46.181 --> 13:51.141
Harry Meacham called me and told me
that you were fired for trashing his club.

13:52.387 --> 13:57.916
So, I took the liberty
of taking $33 out of your sock,

13:57.960 --> 14:00.758
and bringing your stuff down.

14:01.330 --> 14:03.195
Sayonara, pal.

14:05.567 --> 14:07.228
Listen. Look. I...

14:07.269 --> 14:10.705
I got a bout coming up in two days
at the arena. $500.

14:10.739 --> 14:12.798
You think you can give me a break?

14:13.876 --> 14:15.537
No.

14:16.311 --> 14:17.300
No.

14:19.648 --> 14:21.047
Earl...

14:21.083 --> 14:23.415
- got any money now?
- Oh, sure,

14:23.452 --> 14:26.080
but it's all tied up in stocks and bonds.

14:28.023 --> 14:29.854
That's just a bad joke, pal.

14:34.429 --> 14:38.889
You know this burg pretty good -
you got any idea where I could stay?

14:44.055 --> 14:47.286
<i>This was one of those rare mornings
I was up early.</i>

14:47.325 --> 14:51.159
<i>It wasn't so much a zest for life
as it was Earl's snoring.</i>

14:51.195 --> 14:55.256
<i>Like the barking of that St. Bernard</i> -
<i>it was driving me crazy</i>.

14:55.299 --> 14:59.531
<i>Fortunately, Earl was only going to be here
a couple of days.</i>

14:59.570 --> 15:01.231
<i>Just till I found his son</i>.

15:17.521 --> 15:19.079
Oh, my God!

15:21.559 --> 15:24.050
Zeus, Apollo, stay.

15:25.196 --> 15:28.131
- I demand to know the meaning of this.
- Meaning of what?

15:28.165 --> 15:30.759
This man's destruction of estate property.

15:30.801 --> 15:33.133
Destruction? He was skipping rope.

15:33.938 --> 15:35.735
Skipping rope?

15:35.773 --> 15:38.503
- On the dirt.
- That is not dirt.

15:38.542 --> 15:40.737
That is freshly cultivated soil.

15:40.778 --> 15:45.010
Under that soil are 36 anthurium
scherzerianum bulbs imported from Holland

15:45.049 --> 15:50.351
in a specially treated container
at substantial expense to the estate.

15:50.388 --> 15:53.357
Well, I'm sorry, I didn't know about them...

15:53.391 --> 15:57.885
- shez... the bulbs.
- He didn't. It does look like dirt.

15:58.896 --> 16:02.957
Excuse me, but do you think
you can get rid of all those teeth?

16:03.834 --> 16:05.461
Zeus, Apollo, patrol.

16:19.583 --> 16:20.777
Earl?

16:22.720 --> 16:24.381
Oh.

16:26.057 --> 16:32.223
Magnum, I presume this man is your guest,
then so is the responsibility for his actions.

16:32.263 --> 16:34.993
- Wait a minute, I pay my own way.
- That's all right.

16:35.032 --> 16:37.762
This is Higgins. He kind of runs the place.
Earl...

16:37.802 --> 16:42.933
- Sepekis.
- Sepekis. He's kind of a client.

16:42.974 --> 16:45.442
The Mag's putting me up
for a couple of days.

16:45.476 --> 16:47.273
The Mag!

16:47.311 --> 16:48.835
How magnanimous.

16:48.879 --> 16:52.406
However, I think you'll find that
a rather expensive gesture.

16:53.184 --> 16:56.051
Wait a minute. Ain't that the sign of the...

16:59.490 --> 17:01.720
You ever know a guy
by the name of Bostwick?

17:02.560 --> 17:03.857
Corky Bostwick.

17:03.894 --> 17:06.657
- We were stationed at Quang Ju together.
- Really?

17:06.696 --> 17:09.222
You guys got the same tailor.

17:10.601 --> 17:14.162
We served in the same regiment.
The Prince of Wales', West Yorkshire.

17:14.204 --> 17:17.641
Yeah. I tell you,
that Corky was a helluva guy.

17:17.675 --> 17:21.406
- You knew Corky Bostwick?
- Knew him? Are you kidding?

17:21.444 --> 17:24.311
We wrestled through half of South America.

17:24.348 --> 17:26.942
Corky Bostwick, The One-Legged Limey.

17:26.983 --> 17:28.952
Sure, we was a team, boy.

17:28.986 --> 17:31.477
After our routine was finished,

17:31.522 --> 17:35.720
he'd take off his peg leg
and start beating me over the head with it.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.091
People loved it.

17:38.262 --> 17:40.890
I've always wondered
what became of Corky.

17:40.931 --> 17:43.729
- Yeah.
- He took a terrible hit in Anzio.

17:43.768 --> 17:48.000
Then we seemed to lose touch with him.
We heard rumors, though.

17:48.039 --> 17:49.700
- You're a wrestler?
- Yeah.

17:49.740 --> 17:50.900
Professional?

17:50.941 --> 17:56.140
Oh, hey, Mr. White Death,
Doctor Of Destruction, Surgeon Of...

17:56.180 --> 17:59.843
Earl is in Hawaii looking for his son
and I'm helping out.

17:59.884 --> 18:04.344
Corky was regimental champion.
Did he mention a Jonathan Higgins to you?

18:04.388 --> 18:09.917
Higgins? No, but he spoke a lot
about a guy called... Percy Eldridge.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.825
Puddinghead Eldridge.

18:11.862 --> 18:14.194
My God, that brings back memories.

18:14.231 --> 18:17.632
I remember in the Sahara,
Puddinghead, Corky and I were on patrol,

18:17.668 --> 18:19.465
we were lost, actually.

18:19.503 --> 18:24.270
And Puddinghead found the camel,
and the three of you rode back to the oasis.

18:24.308 --> 18:26.606
Sure I remember that.

18:26.644 --> 18:28.043
It's extraordinary.

18:30.214 --> 18:33.911
Hey... wait a minute. I...

18:34.518 --> 18:36.110
I know who you are now.

18:36.720 --> 18:39.018
You're Punky.

18:39.056 --> 18:40.717
Punky?!

18:44.795 --> 18:46.285
I say, Magnum, do you mind?

18:46.330 --> 18:49.356
Me? Of course not... Punky!

18:49.400 --> 18:52.233
If you'll excuse us. Come, Mr. Sepekis.

18:52.269 --> 18:54.601
We'll have breakfast on the patio.

18:54.638 --> 18:57.766
I fancy myself a bit of a wrestling aficionado.

18:57.808 --> 19:01.904
There was a time in Liverpool in '51...
or was it '52? Well, it doesn't matter.

19:01.946 --> 19:06.542
The first time I had seen a professional match,
Ivan Karamazov, The Russian Bear.

19:06.584 --> 19:08.984
Yeah. A dirty fighter. Real dirty, that Ivan.

19:11.922 --> 19:15.619
<i>One of the aspects of modern society
that you just can't get away from,</i>

19:15.659 --> 19:20.824
<i>is the fact that every important milestone</i>
<i>in your life</i> - <i>births, marriages, deaths</i> -

19:20.865 --> 19:22.628
<i>is recorded on a computer</i>.

19:24.368 --> 19:25.357
Next.

19:29.406 --> 19:32.739
<i>Your whole life kept for anybody to see</i>.

19:32.776 --> 19:34.903
<i>That's why I figured it'd be a real snap</i>

19:34.945 --> 19:38.779
<i>reuniting the old wrestler
with his long-lost son Phil.</i>

19:38.816 --> 19:40.807
<i>Kind of gave me a warm feeling</i>.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.591
Next.

20:05.009 --> 20:06.670
Excuse me.

20:06.710 --> 20:08.769
Could you save my place in line?

20:28.365 --> 20:29.525
Hi.

20:29.567 --> 20:30.966
Thank you.

20:31.001 --> 20:35.404
Records, Ms. Jones.

20:36.874 --> 20:37.863
Yes.

20:39.210 --> 20:40.199
Ray!

20:41.011 --> 20:43.104
Why are you calling me here, Ray?

20:46.951 --> 20:48.612
No.

20:48.652 --> 20:52.554
That's just not fair, Ray,
I can't deal with that. It's just not fair.

20:54.525 --> 20:57.255
Who is she, Ray?
I got a right to know, you know.

20:57.919 --> 20:59.355
Please.

21:00.931 --> 21:04.059
After two good months,
you're just gonna walk out on me?

21:05.769 --> 21:09.205
I wanna know who it is.
I've got a right to know.

21:10.207 --> 21:11.868
No.

21:12.809 --> 21:13.969
That tramp.

21:16.913 --> 21:19.245
I'm sorry. I know how hard...

21:19.282 --> 21:21.477
Why don't you mind your own business?

21:27.491 --> 21:29.152
What do you want?

21:30.260 --> 21:32.421
I want access to the microfilm room.

21:32.462 --> 21:36.489
I want to examine the marriage records
from 1961-64.

21:39.269 --> 21:40.759
Fill these out.

21:40.804 --> 21:44.501
Then follow the blue painted line
to the cashier's window.

21:44.541 --> 21:49.069
Then the green line back here.
And then the red line to the microfilm room.

21:50.580 --> 21:52.241
Well, I hope...

21:53.283 --> 21:54.944
Next.

22:13.092 --> 22:16.362
<i>I admit the whole morning
was a major inconvenience.</i>

22:16.406 --> 22:20.467
<i>Being a private investigator
entails a lot of this kind of procedure.</i>

22:20.510 --> 22:23.570
<i>It's not all screeching tires
and glamorous ladies,</i>

22:23.613 --> 22:27.174
<i>and I still had that warm feeling
about the whole thing.</i>

22:27.217 --> 22:28.878
Next.

22:34.658 --> 22:35.989
Records. Ms. Jones.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.952
Ray...

22:38.995 --> 22:41.896
why are you torturing me like this?

22:44.301 --> 22:47.964
<i>Four hours later,</i>
<i>I came out with a name</i> - <i>Phil Lewis</i>.

22:48.004 --> 22:51.940
<i>Earl's son had taken the name
of his stepfather and despite everything,</i>

22:51.975 --> 22:54.443
<i>despite the hassle and inconvenience,</i>

22:54.478 --> 22:59.108
<i>I still had that warm feeling</i> -
<i>a feeling of accomplishing something,</i>

22:59.149 --> 23:01.879
<i>of being one step closer
to bringing people together</i>

23:01.918 --> 23:05.046
<i>instead of breaking them up
on a seamy divorce case.</i>

23:05.088 --> 23:09.821
<i>All those hours and minutes
I spent at the Hall of Records was worth it.</i>

23:15.899 --> 23:19.062
Finally, I get to the cashier's window,

23:19.102 --> 23:21.798
but they say,
"You've gotta have the exact change."

23:21.838 --> 23:24.807
But I already blew that on the parking meter.

23:24.841 --> 23:27.867
Anyway, finally I get back to Ms. Jones,

23:27.911 --> 23:30.744
when her boyfriend calls,
she goes to pieces again,

23:30.781 --> 23:34.376
they take her to the employees' lounge,
I never see her again, but...

23:34.417 --> 23:36.078
at least I got the name.

23:38.622 --> 23:41.989
But finding him -
that's gonna be something else.

23:45.128 --> 23:48.222
Phil Lewis. 124 Kalakaua Street.

23:49.566 --> 23:51.227
He sells insurance.

23:55.272 --> 23:57.103
<i>That warm feeling was back</i>.

23:57.140 --> 24:01.406
<i>I couldn't wait to see the look on Phil's face
when I told him I'd found his father.</i>

24:01.444 --> 24:04.379
My father's dead.
I think there's some mistake.

24:04.414 --> 24:06.644
- You are Phil Lewis?
- Yes.

24:06.683 --> 24:09.846
Your mother's name was Elaine,
your father's name was Earl?

24:09.886 --> 24:11.615
My father's name was James.

24:11.655 --> 24:15.489
He's been dead for about two years.
You're making a mistake.

24:15.525 --> 24:19.256
I don't think so.
Mr. Lewis, I've been to the Hall of Records,

24:19.296 --> 24:23.665
I know your mother's maiden name and that
the man in that picture is your stepfather.

24:23.700 --> 24:25.190
I'm here to talk about Earl.

24:25.235 --> 24:26.896
What are you after, Mr. Magnum?

24:26.937 --> 24:29.838
- What are you trying to pull?
- The two of you together.

24:29.873 --> 24:32.103
Look. Earl asked me to find you.

24:32.142 --> 24:34.940
He's a little apprehensive. He's scared.

24:34.978 --> 24:38.004
- This is very difficult for him.
- I'm sure it is.

24:42.719 --> 24:44.380
What does my father look like?

24:44.421 --> 24:48.187
Well, he's heavy-set, silver-haired,
in his fifties.

24:48.959 --> 24:51.519
As you can see,
the resemblance is overwhelming -

24:51.561 --> 24:54.792
especially since the man
you're talking about doesn't exist.

24:54.831 --> 24:57.698
Who are you really working for,
Mr. Magnum?

24:58.435 --> 25:01.336
- I told you.
- No, I don't think so.

25:01.371 --> 25:04.397
I don't appreciate
you coming in here and harassing me.

25:04.441 --> 25:08.343
Tell whoever's paying you
that the only father I ever knew is dead.

25:08.378 --> 25:12.212
- That's about as clear as I can make it.
- Or wanna make it.

25:13.083 --> 25:16.143
His license checks out.
Thomas Magnum, private eye.

25:16.186 --> 25:17.483
Investigator.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.112
Thank you, Cora.

25:21.892 --> 25:24.383
Look, Magnum, maybe you're legitimate,

25:24.427 --> 25:26.258
but whoever hired you isn't.

25:28.932 --> 25:32.595
You may use this bedroom.
It's Mr. Masters' favorite.

25:32.636 --> 25:37.164
Now, listen, you don't have
to go to all that trouble for me.

25:37.207 --> 25:40.142
Nonsense. I want your stay here
to be of the utmost comfort.

25:40.177 --> 25:43.271
To think you had to share
the guesthouse last night.

25:43.313 --> 25:46.942
Well, I hope you'll enjoy this room.
Rest now and I'll see you at dinner.

25:46.983 --> 25:50.510
Afterwards, we can play billiards
and exchange reminiscences.

25:50.554 --> 25:52.784
- Oh, I'd like that.
- Until then.

25:52.823 --> 25:54.654
Until then!

25:54.691 --> 25:56.352
I'll see you.

26:21.734 --> 26:22.723
That's it.

26:23.469 --> 26:25.232
Ride 'im, tiger, ride 'im!

26:29.308 --> 26:32.038
That's what we call
a Tasmanian tiger dance.

26:32.078 --> 26:35.047
That was great.
Lemme see you guys do another one.

26:35.081 --> 26:36.480
All right. Your turn.

26:37.149 --> 26:38.241
My turn?

26:38.284 --> 26:41.583
Yeah. Well, there's no substitute
for experience, you know.

26:42.722 --> 26:44.383
That's right.

26:44.423 --> 26:45.890
Um...

26:45.925 --> 26:47.415
But I just like to watch.

26:47.460 --> 26:49.587
You got to learn how to defend yourself.

26:49.629 --> 26:53.759
That way you won't have to depend on
your friends all the time to defend you.

26:53.799 --> 26:55.289
All you gotta do is relax.

26:55.334 --> 26:59.600
You won't get hurt. That's the whole idea.
Relax, kind of, like, meditate.

27:00.506 --> 27:03.771
Yeah. That's right.
You know, I never thought of it that way.

27:03.809 --> 27:05.436
Come on, let's meditate.

27:05.478 --> 27:07.912
Whoa. Wait a minute.

27:07.947 --> 27:09.710
- Come on.
- Wait a minute!

27:10.983 --> 27:12.041
Wait!

27:35.007 --> 27:37.271
You all right, buddy?

27:37.977 --> 27:39.103
How d'you like it?

27:40.513 --> 27:42.947
It was just fine. Just fine, Earl.

27:42.982 --> 27:47.442
Great. Now I'm gonna show you
the Detroit death grip.

27:47.486 --> 27:49.511
Detroit death grip?

28:05.538 --> 28:08.598
Magnum, really!
We had the brakes done three weeks ago.

28:08.641 --> 28:10.472
Are you related to the mechanic?

28:10.509 --> 28:13.876
- Where's Earl?
- On the lawn, on the windward side.

28:13.913 --> 28:19.283
He's instructing Rick and T.C. in the fine art
of "eating the canvas", as he puts it.

28:19.318 --> 28:21.912
I say,
your face is even more blank than usual.

28:21.954 --> 28:25.014
Did you encounter some difficulty
in locating Earl's son?

28:25.057 --> 28:26.388
Yes.

28:26.425 --> 28:28.086
I mean no. Well, I'm...

28:28.127 --> 28:30.288
- I mean, I don't know.
- Well put.

28:31.597 --> 28:36.830
Well, Higgins, his son...
just told me that he wasn't his son.

28:36.869 --> 28:39.565
And he got suspicious.
Even ran a make on my license.

28:39.605 --> 28:41.664
Quite commendable, actually.

28:41.707 --> 28:46.041
- So now you're questioning Earl's motives?
- I'm questioning...

28:46.078 --> 28:47.545
if Earl...

28:48.547 --> 28:50.208
is really Earl.

28:50.249 --> 28:53.650
It wouldn't be the first time
a client wasn't straight with me.

28:53.686 --> 28:56.587
If Earl really is Earl,
is he really looking for his son,

28:56.622 --> 28:58.556
or is he just having me set somebody up?

28:58.591 --> 29:01.890
- Magnum!
- Come to think of it... Wait a minute.

29:01.927 --> 29:05.920
I remember Earl saying he didn't
even have to meet his son, just see him.

29:05.965 --> 29:10.834
Even for you, I find this attitude
quite callous, possibly even paranoid.

29:10.870 --> 29:12.895
Earl, in his own way, is a gentleman.

29:12.938 --> 29:14.906
Well, what would you do?

29:14.940 --> 29:18.671
Well, I must say
it does present an interesting dilemma.

29:18.711 --> 29:22.647
I remember once when the regiment
was stationed in Rangoon...

29:22.681 --> 29:29.610
life was quiet, peaceful, tranquil, until
Lieutenant Hilton-Thorpe was transferred in.

29:29.655 --> 29:32.681
Then it became
a ghastly and depressing business.

29:37.897 --> 29:39.558
Hey, Mag!

29:40.933 --> 29:42.867
Well, how did it go?

29:43.636 --> 29:44.796
Well...

29:44.837 --> 29:47.931
- Don't worry about us. We're just leaving.
- No.

29:47.973 --> 29:51.136
- Let's practice our Tasmanian tiger dance.
- Who, me?

29:51.177 --> 29:52.644
Yes, you, tiger.

29:53.646 --> 29:55.273
It goes like this.

29:58.150 --> 29:59.708
Did you find him?

30:01.754 --> 30:03.949
- I think so.
- You think so?

30:03.989 --> 30:06.287
Well, what? Where is he?

30:06.325 --> 30:09.351
Well, he's here in Honolulu just like you said.

30:09.395 --> 30:10.521
Great, great!

30:10.563 --> 30:12.929
Only the guy that I met said
his father's dead.

30:12.965 --> 30:16.799
He was killed in Miami in a traffic accident
27 years ago.

30:17.870 --> 30:21.670
Well, you can see for yourself,
I'm still breathing. Where is he?

30:21.707 --> 30:23.572
You gotta level with me, Earl.

30:23.609 --> 30:27.841
I did some checking. If you've got a past,
nobody seems to know it.

30:27.880 --> 30:31.509
And the name Sepekis
dead-ended in San Diego a month ago.

30:31.550 --> 30:35.179
I don't know who you are.
Or even if he is your son.

30:38.123 --> 30:39.112
Look, Mag...

30:39.158 --> 30:41.786
you gotta believe me when I tell you this.

30:44.296 --> 30:45.957
I can't tell you who I am,

30:45.998 --> 30:47.659
or where I've been.

30:49.835 --> 30:51.496
It just don't matter.

30:51.537 --> 30:54.472
You just gotta believe that I'm Phil's pop.

30:55.574 --> 30:57.565
That's not good enough, Earl.

30:57.610 --> 31:00.204
You could've found him yourself,
it wasn't hard.

31:00.880 --> 31:04.372
One of you isn't telling the truth.
Why do you need an intermediary?

31:04.416 --> 31:05.849
I told you!

31:05.885 --> 31:08.285
It happened such a long time ago...

31:11.390 --> 31:13.324
You don't believe me, do you?

31:13.359 --> 31:15.384
You just don't trust me, do you?

31:15.427 --> 31:16.894
You don't trust me.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.833
Look, Mag, I don't wanna hurt you.

31:23.869 --> 31:26.303
Great. I don't want to hurt you either.

31:26.338 --> 31:27.703
But I want my boy.

31:27.740 --> 31:29.207
I want the truth!

31:30.542 --> 31:31.975
I want my boy!

31:39.952 --> 31:41.977
Now, tell me, where is he?

31:42.554 --> 31:43.543
Where is he?

31:44.957 --> 31:47.323
Isn't that the Omaha powerdriver?

31:47.359 --> 31:51.762
No, that's the Detroit death grip
and it looks like he's doing it for real.

31:53.966 --> 31:54.955
Hey!

31:56.035 --> 31:57.161
Get outta here.

31:57.870 --> 32:00.065
What are you doing to him?

32:08.347 --> 32:10.406
- You're fired!
- I quit!

32:11.984 --> 32:15.181
And you tell him I'm still alive
and that I tried!

32:21.994 --> 32:22.983
Rick?

32:24.496 --> 32:26.657
I think we better get him inside.

32:28.534 --> 32:31.332
He'll be seeing little birdies for a week.

32:44.984 --> 32:45.973
I'll see ya.

32:47.019 --> 32:48.680
Philip.

32:48.954 --> 32:51.923
- What's wrong?
- What?

32:51.957 --> 32:53.618
What is the problem?

32:56.161 --> 32:57.822
The problem is, Punky...

33:00.466 --> 33:02.127
nobody gives a damn.

33:04.370 --> 33:06.668
Nobody trusts anybody anymore.

33:10.542 --> 33:12.203
Nobody knows...

33:13.312 --> 33:15.143
what it means to be a friend.

33:17.282 --> 33:18.943
That's the problem.

33:20.986 --> 33:23.716
- Where are you going?
- It don't matter.

33:23.756 --> 33:24.745
Oh.

33:47.746 --> 33:49.407
Well...

33:49.448 --> 33:51.939
how is our pugilist doing?

33:53.786 --> 33:58.280
He obviously has
what you Yanks call a glass jaw.

33:58.323 --> 34:03.226
Glass jaw? This boy's jaw is pure crystal,
one punch and he's out like a light.

34:05.097 --> 34:07.122
Why wouldn't Earl level with me?

34:07.166 --> 34:09.396
The man's trying to hide something.

34:09.435 --> 34:12.699
You did the right thing
by not telling him about his son.

34:12.737 --> 34:14.103
Perhaps.

34:14.139 --> 34:17.905
But then again, Earl obviously thought
he was doing the right thing, too.

34:18.877 --> 34:23.905
The word honor is more than a dusty
inscription on some pieces of parchment.

34:23.949 --> 34:26.007
For some of us it is a way of life.

34:26.051 --> 34:28.645
I doubt we'll ever find out the real truth.

34:28.687 --> 34:31.315
I know him. I know him.

34:31.356 --> 34:34.655
I know who he is.
He's Earl Gianelli. I shoulda known.

34:34.693 --> 34:39.562
He was a contender back in the '50s.
I knew that uppercut from someplace.

34:39.598 --> 34:44.159
- But I can't believe he's here wrestling.
- Why should that be so incomprehensible?

34:44.203 --> 34:49.664
Many boxers, unable to do anything else,
end their careers as wrestlers. It's common.

34:49.708 --> 34:53.838
- Not if they've got a price on their head.
- A price? What are you talking about?

34:53.879 --> 34:56.507
- Sounds like trouble.
- It is for Earl.

34:56.547 --> 35:00.678
He's the guy who knocked off Sal Marchese
back in '55 in a barber chair.

35:00.719 --> 35:02.448
Who is Sal Marchese?

35:02.488 --> 35:06.151
Sal Marchese was the head
of the Miami branch of the Family.

35:06.191 --> 35:11.219
But Earl wouldn't cooperate, so they killed
Earl's manager, who was his best friend,

35:11.263 --> 35:15.222
just to teach him a lesson.
After that, Earl disappeared.

35:15.267 --> 35:19.135
And ever since then, they've had
a permanent contract out on his head.

35:19.171 --> 35:22.629
That's why he's been wrestling in dives
all this time,

35:22.674 --> 35:27.077
because he knew if he showed up
anywhere, anytime, he'd be a dead man.

35:42.894 --> 35:45.260
<i>Every once in a while,
something will happen</i>

35:45.296 --> 35:48.265
<i>that will totally jolt your sense
of right and wrong,</i>

35:48.299 --> 35:51.996
<i>like watching a buddy take an uppercut
to the jaw that had your name on it.</i>

35:52.432 --> 35:56.300
<i>Something hard and direct
that tends to bring back a sense of reality,</i>

35:56.340 --> 35:58.865
<i>reminds you that all endings aren't happy,</i>

35:58.910 --> 36:03.779
<i>that no matter how hard we try,
we're all going to fail sometime, somehow.</i>

36:03.814 --> 36:06.908
<i>Except my little voice
was telling me that's a cop-out.</i>

36:06.951 --> 36:09.249
<i>You can always try just one more thing</i>.

36:12.089 --> 36:16.150
<i>The car was a rental
and the guys in it had to be out-of-staters.</i>

36:16.194 --> 36:19.493
<i>I can tell because of
all the dumb stickers plastered on it like,</i>

36:19.530 --> 36:22.260
<i>"I'd rather be riding a mule on Molokai."</i>

36:22.300 --> 36:25.326
<i>So I figured
it wouldn't be much of a problem</i>

36:25.369 --> 36:29.066
<i>losing a couple of bozos with six hours' worth
of jet lag on their minds.</i>

36:29.106 --> 36:31.472
<i>But then, on the other hand, why bother?</i>

36:31.509 --> 36:33.033
<i>As near as I could figure it,</i>

36:33.077 --> 36:36.706
<i>there was only one way they could have
been put onto me in the first place.</i>

36:36.747 --> 36:39.375
I'm sorry, Mr. Lewis has gone for the day.

36:40.718 --> 36:45.417
Cora, let's try that again.
I'll bet you made a mistake.

36:45.456 --> 36:49.790
I'll bet you Phil is right inside
that nice little office of his.

36:49.827 --> 36:51.488
If you'll excuse me.

36:55.633 --> 36:57.965
How much are they paying you, Cora?

36:59.704 --> 37:04.505
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Just by the day, week, the year?

37:05.276 --> 37:09.736
A little moonlighting for the Mob
to pay your way through college?

37:09.780 --> 37:13.238
Mr. Magnum, you're crazy.

37:13.284 --> 37:15.411
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

37:15.453 --> 37:19.082
Maybe I was just imagining
the two guys that have been tailing me

37:19.123 --> 37:20.988
ever since you ran a make on me.

37:21.025 --> 37:25.462
Ever since I came into this office
trying to reunite a dead boxer with his son.

37:25.496 --> 37:27.487
Congratulations, Cora.

37:27.531 --> 37:29.658
You hit the jackpot - payday.

37:32.003 --> 37:33.334
This man's crazy.

37:34.372 --> 37:37.899
Go ahead.
Stick your head out that window, Mr. Lewis.

37:37.942 --> 37:39.603
Go ahead.

37:40.711 --> 37:45.944
You'll see a blue Sedan with two guys next to it
who are keen on meeting Earl Gianelli.

37:45.983 --> 37:47.007
Big fans.

37:48.052 --> 37:50.316
Cora can tell you their names.

37:52.890 --> 37:55.222
Really, I don't have to listen to this.

37:56.894 --> 37:58.953
Cora? Cora?

37:58.996 --> 38:01.897
Are you gonna let her get away? You can't.

38:02.700 --> 38:04.292
No, I won't.

38:09.874 --> 38:11.171
Hello, Cora.

38:11.208 --> 38:13.438
- Who are you?
- We're from Miami.

38:13.477 --> 38:16.105
Somebody wants to talk to you.

38:16.147 --> 38:17.444
Real bad.

38:17.481 --> 38:19.142
This way, please.

38:19.183 --> 38:21.674
Please, take your hands off me.

38:21.719 --> 38:22.708
Sure.

38:23.554 --> 38:26.990
- She was a plant.
- Cora's worked for me for three years,

38:27.024 --> 38:29.219
I can't believe that.

38:29.260 --> 38:30.750
Believe it.

38:30.795 --> 38:33.127
These guys
probably met her at lunch one day.

38:33.164 --> 38:36.930
They told her to keep an eye out
for a face, a name.

38:36.967 --> 38:37.991
Your father.

38:39.003 --> 38:41.801
There were bucks in it,
she didn't know any better.

38:41.839 --> 38:44.808
Look, I'm not a cop
and I don't work for the Mob,

38:44.842 --> 38:47.868
I'm here to finish the job
that Earl Gianelli hired me to do.

38:47.912 --> 38:51.678
The best help you can give the both of us
is just stay out of it.

38:51.716 --> 38:52.705
I will...

38:53.417 --> 38:56.181
just as soon as
I get the two of you connected.

38:57.188 --> 39:00.157
You can't. Not now, not ever.

39:02.026 --> 39:04.256
It's been a long hard road for him.

39:06.464 --> 39:10.298
Your father's getting old -
that's why he came to Hawaii.

39:11.335 --> 39:13.633
Look, that's why I'm here...

39:14.705 --> 39:17.401
to get as far away from him
as I possibly can.

39:18.476 --> 39:21.536
I grew up thinking
my dad had run out on me.

39:21.579 --> 39:24.707
You know, I woke up one morning
and he was gone.

39:26.717 --> 39:28.878
He was supposed to take me
to a ball game,

39:28.919 --> 39:30.784
but we didn't make it.

39:31.589 --> 39:36.390
I wish he could have taken me to that game,
but I understand why he didn't.

39:39.330 --> 39:42.390
My mother told me the truth about that
before she died.

39:43.667 --> 39:47.626
And I also know that if I ever let him
get near me, then he's dead.

39:51.008 --> 39:54.535
Look, Magnum,
all I'm trying to do is keep him alive.

39:57.248 --> 39:59.148
Why don't you let me take care of that?

40:37.354 --> 40:39.015
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

40:39.056 --> 40:43.652
<i>the winner and new heavyweight champion
of Hawaii,</i>

40:43.694 --> 40:47.494
<i>on a disqualification</i>...

41:33.344 --> 41:34.368
Where is he?

41:37.481 --> 41:38.470
Back there.

41:52.796 --> 41:55.356
We finally got you, Gianelli.

42:04.308 --> 42:05.570
Yee-ah!

42:12.483 --> 42:13.472
Hold it.

42:33.971 --> 42:36.371
Go straight to Gate 12 and wait there.

42:36.407 --> 42:38.068
Gate 12.

42:38.108 --> 42:39.769
Goodbye, old chap.

42:41.445 --> 42:43.606
Goodbye... Punky.

42:44.815 --> 42:48.717
Oh, and... say goodbye to Magnum, too,
all right?

42:48.752 --> 42:49.980
All right.

42:51.388 --> 42:53.049
So long.

43:00.531 --> 43:04.627
<i>Flight 121 for San Francisco
now loading at Gate 12.</i>

43:08.839 --> 43:12.070
<i>Last call for flight 121 to San Francisco</i>.

43:19.083 --> 43:21.449
Hey!

43:21.485 --> 43:24.079
Hey, Mag, come here.

43:49.880 --> 43:50.869
Pop.

43:58.522 --> 44:00.012
I'm...

44:00.057 --> 44:02.491
I'm sorry we missed that ball game.

44:04.128 --> 44:05.857
Sometimes you get rained out.

44:06.497 --> 44:09.728
<i>Flight 121, the doors are closing.
Last call.</i>

44:11.502 --> 44:13.936
Come with me, Phil. Come with me.

44:13.971 --> 44:16.838
I can't... and you know that.

44:18.709 --> 44:20.370
I'll write you. I'll write you.

44:20.411 --> 44:22.879
You can't.
They'll just find out where you are.

44:28.218 --> 44:32.655
Maybe someday we'll make that ball game,
huh, son?

44:32.690 --> 44:36.319
Yeah, Pop. Yeah, maybe we will.

45:08.692 --> 45:10.523
<i>That warm feeling was back</i>.

45:10.561 --> 45:13.155
<i>I guess it wasn't as easy
as I thought it'd be,</i>

45:13.197 --> 45:16.394
<i>and the reunion as long as it should be,
but it was enough.</i>

45:16.433 --> 45:21.268
<i>Because in that one moment,
Earl and his son shared a lifetime.</i>

45:36.386 --> 45:38.047
Hi, Punky.

45:38.088 --> 45:39.749
Magnum...

45:41.125 --> 45:43.218
don't you ever call me that again.

45:43.260 --> 45:48.061
Gee, Higgins,
it's so cute the way Earl says it.

45:48.098 --> 45:51.534
Puddinghead, Corky, all the lads.

45:51.568 --> 45:53.399
And you. Punky.

45:53.437 --> 45:56.634
- Magnum.
- Higgins, it's so quaint.

45:56.673 --> 45:59.801
I mean, nobody's called Punky anymore.

45:59.843 --> 46:01.902
If you persist in this...

46:08.719 --> 46:12.086
The tennis courts for two weeks,
the hot tub for three,

46:12.122 --> 46:16.058
- and the wide-screen TV for the weekend.
- Absolutely not.

46:16.093 --> 46:17.856
- OK. Punk...
- Mag...

46:22.900 --> 46:24.333
All right.

46:34.645 --> 46:37.045
- Hi, guys.
- Don't "hi, guy" us.

46:37.080 --> 46:40.743
That's right.
Just save it for some other suckers, OK?

46:40.784 --> 46:42.911
OK, OK.

46:43.554 --> 46:46.921
Here.
I'll just leave you alone to play your game.

46:46.957 --> 46:49.289
Wait just a second. Did Earl get off OK?

46:51.128 --> 46:52.618
Safe and sound.

46:54.131 --> 46:55.655
Yeah. For now.

46:55.699 --> 46:58.293
He's still got that permanent contract
out on him.

46:58.335 --> 47:01.668
Those guys won't quit,
they're like mad dogs.

47:01.705 --> 47:05.004
- Don't forget it, Thomas.
- They'll just keep after him.

47:05.042 --> 47:09.240
I hate to say this, Thomas,
but one day they're gonna get him.

47:09.279 --> 47:11.406
You can make book on that.

47:12.850 --> 47:14.511
Yeah.

47:14.551 --> 47:16.212
Maybe.

47:24.261 --> 47:25.523
But not today.
