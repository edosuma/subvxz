00:06.513 --> 00:11.985
Good night. Thank you for your kind
patronage of Shashi's Electronics Emporium.

00:12.073 --> 00:14.064
Cheap bastard.

00:21.033 --> 00:25.185
Hate to trouble you when you're about
to close, but I need a couple of D batteries.

00:25.273 --> 00:26.865
Fresh out. Sorry.

00:26.953 --> 00:29.945
Really? No D batteries
in the whole bloomin' store?

00:30.033 --> 00:32.024
We're closed. Go away.

00:32.113 --> 00:35.264
If you're gonna be rude,
I'll take my patronage elsewhere.

00:35.353 --> 00:37.662
Good. Go. Take it away.

00:51.113 --> 00:54.105
Guess what.
You're having an after-hours sale.

01:11.713 --> 01:13.510
Hey, Eddy. D batteries.

01:14.513 --> 01:17.425
What? I thought you needed some.

01:18.433 --> 01:19.866
Hey, check this out.

01:20.193 --> 01:24.823
Hey, I heard of these things. Supposed to
bark and walk and act just like a real dog.

01:24.913 --> 01:27.586
- It's annoying.
- I don't think he likes you.

01:29.793 --> 01:31.784
Shut up! I'm warning you.

01:36.953 --> 01:39.547
C-437. Been looking for one of these.

01:45.233 --> 01:48.225
Boys, I think we've got a little problem.

02:01.193 --> 02:05.152
Some Steelheads robbing an electronics
store. Why'd you want me to see it?

02:05.233 --> 02:07.030
Hang on.

02:15.473 --> 02:18.909
- Zack...
- Your brother's alive, Max.

02:18.993 --> 02:22.190
You might wanna brace yourself
for what comes next.

02:30.833 --> 02:35.509
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

02:35.593 --> 02:37.470
Then she escaped.

02:37.553 --> 02:41.990
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

02:42.073 --> 02:44.428
she is haunted by her past.

02:44.513 --> 02:49.303
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

03:27.513 --> 03:30.346
I can't believe it. He's alive.

03:30.433 --> 03:32.742
You told me you saw him at Manticore.

03:34.513 --> 03:36.981
They had been harvesting his organs.

03:37.793 --> 03:40.591
His liver and kidneys
went to an X5 wounded on a mission.

03:40.673 --> 03:44.825
His heart - of course, as you know -
went to you.

03:48.073 --> 03:51.065
I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for him.

03:53.153 --> 03:59.592
Renfro said something about moving him to
another facility. That they had plans for him.

04:00.713 --> 04:03.910
Looks like they were experimenting
with cybernetic implants.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.791
Probably replaced his organs
with artificial ones.

04:06.873 --> 04:10.752
- How'd he end up with those Steelheads?
- Could be when Manticore shut down

04:10.833 --> 04:13.188
a lab tech unloaded him on the black market.

04:13.273 --> 04:16.743
A genetically engineered soldier
with cutting-edge cybernetics?

04:16.833 --> 04:21.065
- Steelheads'd be all over it.
- All I know is I've gotta find him.

04:21.153 --> 04:25.351
- Do you have any idea where they hang?
- Wish I did.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.947
Been looking to take them down for months.

04:28.033 --> 04:31.343
British Eddy and his crew
are running a body-parts ring,

04:31.433 --> 04:36.063
paying off hospitals, getting their hands
on organs meant for transplant candidates,

04:36.153 --> 04:38.348
then shipping them overseas for a profit.

04:38.673 --> 04:41.551
- Any leads?
- Nothin' solid.

04:41.633 --> 04:46.991
But I put word out on the informant net. I'll
let you know as soon as anything turns up.

04:47.073 --> 04:48.870
Thanks.

04:52.073 --> 04:54.746
- She's gonna be here in 15.
- Well, let's see.

04:54.833 --> 04:58.223
15 minutes, which is 33 minutes
from when she should have been here,

04:58.313 --> 05:03.512
brings us to a grand total of 48 minutes late.
OK. 13th and Kendrick. Hot run.

05:03.593 --> 05:07.381
- She had a doctor's appointment.
- I don't pay you enough to see a doctor.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.509
2348 Euclid, bip bip bip.

05:09.593 --> 05:12.471
Look, she made me promise
to keep it on the low-low,

05:13.113 --> 05:15.866
but this doctor she's been seeing is a shrink.

05:15.953 --> 05:19.912
I see. Has the stress from her 11-to-4 job
finally become too much for her?

05:19.993 --> 05:23.747
As a matter of fact, yeah.
She's been acting strange at home lately.

05:23.833 --> 05:28.065
She keeps going on about violent
work-related fantasies she's been having.

05:30.393 --> 05:34.022
I hate to think what'd happen
if she finds out she's been fired.

05:34.113 --> 05:37.150
- Did you say violent?
- Gave me nightmares.

05:44.673 --> 05:46.193
- What?
- I got a package for you when you're ready.

05:46.193 --> 05:47.182
- What?
- I got a package for you when you're ready.

05:47.273 --> 05:52.142
- Give me five minutes.
- Take whatever feels appropriate. I'm flexible.

05:52.233 --> 05:53.632
Very flexible.

05:55.553 --> 05:59.512
You know you're my girl, but you have
got to try harder to get here on time.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.823
Normal was looking to fire you again.

06:01.913 --> 06:05.986
- Luckily I talked him out of it.
- Thanks.

06:06.073 --> 06:09.986
You gonna tell me what's on your mind,
or am I gonna have to smack it outta you?

06:10.073 --> 06:11.791
It's Zack.

06:11.873 --> 06:15.024
- He's alive.
- Whoa.

06:16.433 --> 06:19.709
OK. One might think you'd be happy
to know your boy's all right.

06:19.793 --> 06:21.863
That's the thing. I don't know if he is.

06:21.953 --> 06:26.629
For some reason he's running with a bunch
of Steelheads. I don't know how to reach him.

06:26.713 --> 06:28.544
Steelheads?

06:30.833 --> 06:34.303
- Sketchy!
- You bellowed, Your Originalness.

06:34.393 --> 06:36.861
Tell Max about the guys that kicked your butt.

06:36.953 --> 06:40.389
It's been a violent month for me.
Could you be a tad more specific?

06:40.473 --> 06:44.182
The guys with the shiny spikes
comin' out of their appendages?

06:44.273 --> 06:50.462
Oh, those guys. I'm afraid the specifics
of that particular butt-kicking are a little hazy.

06:50.553 --> 06:52.828
- Then un-haze fast!
- I can't.

06:52.913 --> 06:56.667
- Why not?
- I promised someone I wouldn't talk about it,

06:56.753 --> 06:58.425
especially to you.

06:59.593 --> 07:02.266
- Who, Sketch?
- Have you been lifting weights?

07:02.353 --> 07:04.583
- Who?
- I made a promise.

07:04.673 --> 07:09.701
I promise if you don't tell me in five seconds,
I'm gonna introduce your face to your colon.

07:12.553 --> 07:14.544
We need to talk.

07:18.313 --> 07:21.066
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:21.153 --> 07:23.144
This is the place.

07:24.553 --> 07:27.113
- You're sure?
- Yup.

07:27.193 --> 07:31.948
In fact, I specifically remember slamming
one of their heads against this post here.

07:32.033 --> 07:35.787
- All right, can I go now?
- No. You duped Sketchy into selling steroids.

07:35.873 --> 07:38.068
You're lucky I don't turn you in to the cops.

07:38.153 --> 07:41.782
I got out of all that once I heard
the stuff can make your heart explode.

07:41.873 --> 07:47.903
Once your clientele starts dying, who do you
sell to? It made no business sense long-term.

07:47.993 --> 07:50.507
If this is the Steelheads' turf, where are they?

07:50.593 --> 07:55.906
- Probably tweaking each other's circuits.
- Then we're gonna have to get their attention.

07:55.993 --> 08:00.225
- Please tell me you're gonna get naked.
- No, you're going back into the steroid biz.

08:00.313 --> 08:05.671
- They made it clear they didn't want me here.
- Imagine how ticked off they'd be to see you.

08:05.753 --> 08:11.510
But they'll come packing this time. No, I have
zero interest in tangling with these psychos.

08:11.593 --> 08:14.983
- I'm gonna find my brother with your help.
- Your brother.

08:15.073 --> 08:18.270
- That's cute, Max.
- He's the closest thing to family I have.

08:18.353 --> 08:22.107
I don't expect you to understand,
but I expect your cooperation. Or else.

08:22.193 --> 08:24.753
- Or else what?
- I tell Normal how you used Jam Pony

08:24.833 --> 08:28.906
to peddle steroids, and he'll can your ass.
No more job means no more sector pass.

08:28.993 --> 08:33.783
- How am I supposed to get around?
- I dunno. Be hard for you to be a cat burglar.

08:37.352 --> 08:40.424
Andy anyone? Anybody want some andy?

08:40.513 --> 08:45.029
You looking for some andy? You could beef
up a little bit. No? All right. Andy, anybody?

08:45.113 --> 08:47.104
Let's get it on!

08:58.473 --> 09:00.509
All right. One more time.

09:07.953 --> 09:13.186
Oh, God, not again. You've had that arm less
than a week. You'll break the sodding thing.

09:13.273 --> 09:15.389
No, I can beat him, Eddy. I know it.

09:18.393 --> 09:22.466
Went and chopped my arm off, when
all I needed was an exoharness like GI Jerk.

09:22.553 --> 09:26.148
Cheer up, Birdy.
Maybe Santa'll bring you one for Christmas.

09:26.233 --> 09:30.465
There. Ought to do you for today, mate.
Blood's nice and clean.

09:30.553 --> 09:33.511
- Keepin' good care of him, aren't we, Bird?
- Yeah.

09:33.593 --> 09:36.187
Makin' sure he don't get all rusty inside.

09:51.393 --> 09:54.112
Our boy sure is a weird one.

09:54.193 --> 09:56.661
Quiet. Too quiet.

09:56.753 --> 09:59.347
He knows when to shut his gob, that's all.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.501
- I think he's kinda cute.
- Hey.

10:03.593 --> 10:06.949
Can't you see
I'm trying to watch me cartoons?

10:07.953 --> 10:10.672
Hey, guess who's pushin' andy again.

10:10.753 --> 10:14.792
That frail that mangled us
a couple of weeks ago at the marketplace.

10:19.193 --> 10:20.990
Soldier.

10:23.713 --> 10:25.863
You're movin' out.

10:27.273 --> 10:29.343
What do you mean, you don't have it on you?

10:29.433 --> 10:32.982
If you give me your name and address,
I'll pop it in the mail tomorrow.

10:33.073 --> 10:35.064
You wack punk.

10:39.233 --> 10:41.224
This is ridiculous.

10:41.993 --> 10:45.542
- Hey, you.
- Finally. You realise how long I've waited?

10:45.633 --> 10:48.466
Not nearly as long as I've waited for you.

11:17.953 --> 11:19.989
Zack.

11:22.433 --> 11:23.832
Zack.

11:26.273 --> 11:27.865
It's me.

11:29.793 --> 11:31.909
It's Max.

11:33.633 --> 11:35.271
Who are you?

11:39.313 --> 11:41.543
Zack, it's me.

11:41.633 --> 11:42.827
Zack.

11:43.713 --> 11:45.510
It's Max.

11:51.113 --> 11:52.387
Max, it's you.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.181
You're an X5.

11:56.273 --> 11:59.345
- Show me your bar code.
- Max, show it to him already.

12:11.353 --> 12:13.708
You're 452.

12:13.793 --> 12:16.227
I know you. You're in my unit.

12:17.193 --> 12:18.831
That's right.

12:18.913 --> 12:20.904
I'm Max.

12:21.553 --> 12:23.225
Max.

12:25.073 --> 12:27.064
Come on. Let's get you outta here.

12:28.713 --> 12:31.910
- What about them?
- They're not in our unit.

12:38.913 --> 12:41.222
I'm fine.

12:41.673 --> 12:46.463
- I appreciate you doing this, Sam.
- No problem. Tell Eyes Only I'm glad to help.

12:46.553 --> 12:49.353
I should warn you.
He's undergone radical medical procedures.

12:49.353 --> 12:49.751
I should warn you.
He's undergone radical medical procedures.

12:49.833 --> 12:52.028
Believe me. I've seen it all.

12:52.113 --> 12:55.071
You might want to meet them
downstairs just the same.

12:55.153 --> 12:59.544
- Neither of us want anyone asking questions.
- Whatever you say.

13:05.113 --> 13:06.910
Why don't we get started?

13:07.753 --> 13:09.948
Any allergies I should know about?

13:11.593 --> 13:16.428
Guess not. Moving along. Are you currently
taking any prescription medication?

13:16.513 --> 13:19.073
Vitamin supplements?
Anything for your skin?

13:19.153 --> 13:24.830
He didn't even recognise me at first.
It was like he'd never seen me before.

13:25.313 --> 13:30.831
He took a bullet point-blank to the head. It's
logical there'd be some cognitive damage.

13:31.993 --> 13:36.862
Zack was the leader.
Any situation, he knew what to do.

13:37.713 --> 13:40.181
Now look at him.

13:40.593 --> 13:42.948
He's so lost.

13:48.713 --> 13:53.184
I'm running some additional scans on him
now, but I wanted to show you these.

13:53.273 --> 13:56.026
Most of his major organs are biosynthetic.

13:56.113 --> 14:00.550
From what I can tell, they're more efficient
and durable than the ones they replaced.

14:00.633 --> 14:04.911
- What about his arm?
- Looks like there was some nerve damage,

14:04.993 --> 14:08.542
so they grafted on an exoskeleton
to enhance motor function.

14:08.633 --> 14:13.627
This is more advanced than what you have.
Manticore was doing cutting-edge stuff.

14:13.713 --> 14:17.706
If they're so good, how come they didn't
fix it so he can remember his name?

14:17.793 --> 14:19.385
Memory's a tricky thing.

14:19.473 --> 14:24.183
The various associations that form a memory
are stored in different parts of the brain.

14:24.273 --> 14:29.142
It's the temporal lobe's job to keep track
of how those things are all interconnected.

14:29.233 --> 14:31.224
- And his was damaged?
- Right.

14:32.753 --> 14:36.712
But they replaced it
with a cybernetic implant,

14:36.793 --> 14:39.626
which seems capable
of rebuilding those connections.

14:39.713 --> 14:43.422
- So there's a chance his memory will return?
- It's possible.

14:43.513 --> 14:47.665
Look what happened with you. Seeing
your face wasn't enough to recognise you,

14:47.753 --> 14:50.586
but when he heard your name
and read your bar code,

14:50.673 --> 14:54.632
the implant pulled the fragments together
to form the memory of who you are.

14:54.713 --> 14:59.184
- If I take him to a place we've been together...
- It might trigger more memories.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.309
He could get confused at times.

15:01.393 --> 15:06.626
He might not be able to distinguish between
an event that happened or one he dreamt of.

15:06.713 --> 15:09.591
Some things he might lose
because of tissue damage,

15:09.673 --> 15:10.513
but, that aside, there's a chance
he could recover almost everything.

15:10.513 --> 15:13.744
But, that aside, there's a chance
he could recover almost everything.

15:13.833 --> 15:16.301
- When will we know?
- It's hard to say.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.384
Could take some time.

15:23.753 --> 15:25.948
I've seen you before.

15:27.673 --> 15:29.664
This is Logan.

15:35.593 --> 15:37.584
It's good to see you, Zack.

15:39.473 --> 15:42.909
You worried about Max?
The biggest threat to her safety is you.

15:42.993 --> 15:44.551
How do you figure?

15:45.433 --> 15:48.152
I remember you.

15:48.233 --> 15:50.428
It's a good sign.

15:55.953 --> 15:58.626
- What do you mean you lost him?
- They got the drop on us.

15:58.713 --> 16:02.228
- Who's "they"?
- There was this girl revved up just like he is.

16:02.313 --> 16:06.704
- Another one of those Manticorians?
- The way she moved, had to be.

16:06.793 --> 16:09.466
Yeah, and she took off with her boy. I saw.

16:09.553 --> 16:14.547
I want him back. He cost me a pretty penny
and I miss him, I do.

16:14.633 --> 16:17.431
Don't worry, Eddy. We'll get him back.

16:17.513 --> 16:21.791
Lux, you know where this bloke
selling the andy hangs, right?

16:21.873 --> 16:24.068
- Place called Crash.
- Right then.

16:24.873 --> 16:29.424
You two are gonna stake the place.
Next time he shows his face, you nab him.

16:29.513 --> 16:33.711
You get him to tell you where the bird
took GI Joe, then you get our boy back.

16:33.793 --> 16:37.024
- That's a good plan, Eddy.
- It is, isn't it?

16:42.553 --> 16:45.989
So why the hell are you two
standing around here for, eh?

16:53.313 --> 16:55.304
You don't remember?

17:01.313 --> 17:04.385
You came here once, looking for me.

17:04.473 --> 17:06.667
You were hurt.

17:10.673 --> 17:14.871
It's OK. The doctor said
it would take a while anyway.

17:17.073 --> 17:19.064
Have a seat.

17:26.473 --> 17:28.907
Lights out. It's time to bunk down.

17:28.993 --> 17:30.984
It's just a brownout.

17:34.153 --> 17:36.542
We're not in Manticore any more.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.462
Manticore?

17:42.193 --> 17:45.344
Home sweet home
for the first ten years of our lives.

17:45.913 --> 17:47.107
We ran away.

17:53.953 --> 17:55.784
We abandoned our mission.

17:56.233 --> 17:58.303
We got a new mission.

17:59.633 --> 18:03.706
It's called getting a life. It was your idea.

18:03.793 --> 18:07.308
You looked out for us.
Made sure we were all OK.

18:08.673 --> 18:11.870
The others. Where are they now?

18:13.193 --> 18:15.866
- All over the place.
- Are they safe?

18:28.233 --> 18:32.465
Don't worry about that right now.
Just concentrate on getting better.

18:35.353 --> 18:37.662
Come on. You should get some sleep.

18:37.753 --> 18:39.744
This isn't my bunk.

18:39.833 --> 18:43.269
You can use it. My roommate's
staying with some friends.

18:47.073 --> 18:49.462
Welcome home, Zack.

19:29.193 --> 19:30.467
Max!

19:30.553 --> 19:32.748
- Stay out of this.
- Back off.

19:33.033 --> 19:34.307
Max!

19:35.353 --> 19:37.821
X5-599, I've got a heart for you.

20:06.953 --> 20:09.103
I'm sorry.

20:09.193 --> 20:11.707
- What's wrong?
- I remember...

20:13.033 --> 20:14.830
everything.

20:17.673 --> 20:20.983
I failed you. I failed all of you.

20:21.073 --> 20:23.109
No.

20:23.193 --> 20:26.549
I let Manticore catch Brin and kill Tinga.

20:26.633 --> 20:28.783
That wasn't your fault.

20:30.793 --> 20:32.431
I even let 'em kill you.

20:32.513 --> 20:34.504
Zack.

20:35.713 --> 20:37.988
Look at me.

20:39.593 --> 20:41.504
What did they do to me?

20:45.673 --> 20:47.709
What am I?

20:50.753 --> 20:53.950
Feel that? That's you in there.

20:54.033 --> 20:56.024
You saved my life.

20:57.433 --> 20:59.230
That's who you are.

21:00.473 --> 21:04.989
You're someone who will sacrifice everything
to protect the ones you love.

21:15.593 --> 21:17.788
I love you, Max.

21:20.473 --> 21:23.704
I'll never let anything happen to you again.

21:24.753 --> 21:26.744
I know you won't.

21:26.833 --> 21:28.824
I know.

21:40.953 --> 21:43.148
Up and at 'em.

21:56.873 --> 21:58.067
What?

21:58.153 --> 22:01.270
- It's unbelievable.
- What happened?

22:01.353 --> 22:04.390
Nanocytes. Circulating in his bloodstream.

22:04.793 --> 22:08.672
Self-replicating bio-machines
designed to repair tissue damage.

22:08.753 --> 22:12.632
I've read theoretical papers on them,
but to see them in action...

22:12.713 --> 22:17.070
If he's got nanocytes fixing things, how
come they weren't doing their job yesterday?

22:17.153 --> 22:19.428
- Got me.
- It's the machine.

22:19.513 --> 22:23.222
- What machine?
- Eddy hooked me up to it almost every day.

22:23.313 --> 22:27.625
- Said it would filter my blood.
- My ass! He was sifting out your nanocytes.

22:27.713 --> 22:32.264
It explains why no tissue repair was going on.
It couldn't replicate in your bloodstream.

22:32.353 --> 22:34.913
Eddy said I looked cooler with no skin.

22:34.993 --> 22:39.828
At least we can take you out in public now.
Just gotta hook you up with a pair of shades.

22:39.913 --> 22:42.108
Hold on a second. Let me see something.

22:44.833 --> 22:49.782
Close your eye for a second. A little pressure
ought to stimulate the ocular implant.

22:49.873 --> 22:51.670
Open.

22:56.753 --> 22:59.825
Huh. Thought so.

22:59.913 --> 23:03.667
It's coated with liquid crystal,
the stuff they use on high def TVs.

23:03.753 --> 23:09.111
I guess Manticore wanted you to look normal
so they could send you out on missions.

23:10.313 --> 23:12.702
Guess what.

23:13.713 --> 23:16.393
Got a new mission. It's called gettin' a life.

23:16.393 --> 23:16.791
Got a new mission. It's called gettin' a life.

23:17.273 --> 23:21.027
- Can you believe it?
- Actually, no.

23:21.113 --> 23:25.311
This, I'll hang onto for a while.
Doc said the nerve damage should heal soon.

23:25.393 --> 23:29.784
- Careful. People'll think you're a Steelhead.
- That's all I need!

23:30.713 --> 23:34.626
Speaking of which, I was wondering
if you could do me a favour.

23:34.713 --> 23:37.671
- Sure thing.
- Those Steelheads you were with.

23:37.753 --> 23:40.392
Eyes Only's been trying
to track them down for months.

23:40.473 --> 23:44.864
I was hoping maybe you could tell me
where Eddy and his crew were holed up.

24:04.713 --> 24:06.351
You...

24:06.433 --> 24:09.550
- You're Eyes Only.
- Yeah. You knew that.

24:09.633 --> 24:13.342
Logan did that Eyes Only broadcast for us.
Remember?

24:13.433 --> 24:18.109
- To warn the others Lydecker was onto them.
- Yeah, sure. I remember.

24:18.193 --> 24:20.343
You helped plan our assault on Manticore.

24:20.433 --> 24:23.584
You and Lydecker ran the operation
while we went in.

24:23.673 --> 24:26.426
- That's right.
- Funny how that mission went sideways.

24:26.513 --> 24:28.947
- What are you trying to say?
- I just said it.

24:29.033 --> 24:31.024
Come on.

24:32.433 --> 24:34.822
I'm not telling you anything.

24:37.793 --> 24:40.591
What the hell was that?

24:40.673 --> 24:43.870
I don't know. I'm so sorry.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.309
Logan didn't deserve that.

24:57.273 --> 24:59.104
You were way out of line.

25:01.193 --> 25:03.707
I know. I'm sorry.

25:04.993 --> 25:08.508
Guess I'm still having a hard time
accepting what happened.

25:08.593 --> 25:10.713
Looking for someone else to blame
besides myself.

25:10.713 --> 25:12.192
Looking for someone else to blame
besides myself.

25:12.273 --> 25:14.423
We already talked about that, Zack.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.549
Anyway, I'm sorry.

25:21.473 --> 25:26.786
Remember the night we decided it was time
to stop running and take down Manticore?

25:26.873 --> 25:28.670
We were right here.

25:29.873 --> 25:31.864
I remember.

25:37.873 --> 25:39.829
It seems like just yesterday.

25:41.313 --> 25:43.304
A lot's changed since then.

25:44.193 --> 25:45.990
Manticore's gone.

25:46.913 --> 25:50.462
- What do you mean?
- It burnt to the ground.

25:53.433 --> 25:55.822
Don't worry. I got everybody out.

25:57.673 --> 26:00.346
You finished the mission.

26:00.433 --> 26:02.583
Thanks to you.

26:05.993 --> 26:10.384
So there's a whole lot more of us
out in the world.

26:10.473 --> 26:14.944
- They're gonna need looking out for.
- I was hoping you'd say that.

26:15.033 --> 26:19.390
- So much for settling down into a normal life.
- What's normal, anyway?

26:20.593 --> 26:21.992
Yeah.

26:22.073 --> 26:25.031
Besides, we have each other.

26:25.393 --> 26:27.384
Like always.

26:39.553 --> 26:41.623
I gotta swing by work. Come on.

26:56.753 --> 26:59.062
Wait here. I'll just be a sec. OK?

27:04.273 --> 27:05.672
Normal!

27:07.033 --> 27:09.501
- What are you doin' to my locker?
- Your locker?

27:09.593 --> 27:12.630
No, it was nothing.
I thought I saw a roach.

27:14.993 --> 27:19.589
Sorry I haven't been around much the
last couple of days. Stuff I had to deal with.

27:19.673 --> 27:22.585
- Doctor appointment.
- That's OK. No problem.

27:22.673 --> 27:26.746
I didn't want you to think
I up and vanished on you again.

27:26.833 --> 27:32.590
Take all the time you need. After all, one's
health has gotta be the most important thing.

27:32.673 --> 27:37.144
By the way, have I told you how impressed
I've been with your work lately?

27:37.593 --> 27:41.905
- Are you feeling OK?
- I understand I've been hard on you kids,

27:41.993 --> 27:47.351
but it all comes from a place of love. You
realise that it all comes from a place of love?

27:48.673 --> 27:50.584
Whatever.

27:54.153 --> 27:57.862
Max, why didn't you tell me
my boy was back in town?

27:57.953 --> 28:00.183
- Didn't know you were close.
- You kidding?

28:00.273 --> 28:04.551
Back when he was a Jam Pony hump,
he showed me shortcuts through downtown.

28:04.633 --> 28:08.990
- Helped me shave hours off my work day.
- Giving you extra time to nap and get high.

28:09.073 --> 28:11.382
Precisely. I'm for ever in your debt.

28:13.633 --> 28:16.511
- Glad I could help.
- You must come to Crash tonight.

28:16.593 --> 28:18.584
What do you say?

28:19.833 --> 28:22.028
- Sounds good.
- Outstanding.

28:22.113 --> 28:26.152
Eight o'clock, back room.
Last one there does a naked keg stand.

28:28.153 --> 28:30.872
I always liked Sketchy,

28:30.953 --> 28:32.944
I think.

28:42.953 --> 28:47.981
Now he has total recall, what next? Hook him
back up at Jam Pony? Help get him a place?

28:48.073 --> 28:51.668
- Livin' the dream.
- I haven't really thought about it.

28:52.873 --> 28:54.750
I'm just glad he's back.

28:54.833 --> 28:57.506
Things are lookin' up now. It's about time.

29:02.873 --> 29:05.228
- Who won?
- He spanked me ten-zip.

29:05.313 --> 29:09.829
- It was no big deal.
- Wasn't a fair fight, what with his cyberhand.

29:09.913 --> 29:10.753
- Figure maybe I ought to get one.
- Maybe you should try to get a cyberhead.

29:10.753 --> 29:13.984
- Figure maybe I ought to get one.
- Maybe you should try to get a cyberhead.

29:14.073 --> 29:18.942
- What I could really use is another beer.
- I think it's my turn to buy.

29:21.073 --> 29:24.543
- I'll go with ya.
- Sit down, six-dollar man.

29:24.913 --> 29:28.189
Max, Max, Max, may I ask a question?

29:28.273 --> 29:31.345
There's something a little off
about Brother Zack.

29:31.433 --> 29:33.310
Like what?

29:33.393 --> 29:38.592
- He doesn't act like any brother I've seen.
- If you have something to say, spit it out.

29:38.673 --> 29:41.551
Seems to me he's got the hots for you.
Kinky, if you ask me.

29:41.633 --> 29:43.385
- Stay out of it.
- I'm just saying.

29:43.473 --> 29:46.385
Don't. I don't wanna know
what goes on in your sick mind.

29:46.473 --> 29:49.192
- That hurts.
- Truth always does.

29:58.793 --> 30:00.590
Can I get a refill?

30:01.993 --> 30:03.745
Sorry.

30:04.113 --> 30:06.707
Wonder what's keepin' my girl.

30:06.793 --> 30:09.990
Well, I'd give her a hand,
but she'd just bite it off.

30:12.873 --> 30:15.068
There goes her knight in shining armour.

30:15.153 --> 30:20.432
God forbid our little Max should have to lug
a heavy pitcher of beer in her delicate hands.

30:21.313 --> 30:21.904
What?

30:25.393 --> 30:28.590
- Max. Where is she?
- Had too much to drink.

30:28.673 --> 30:31.904
Left with a couple of
Steelhead friends of hers.

30:33.793 --> 30:37.422
Hey, Eddy, think she's got nanocytes
inside her like our boy did?

30:37.513 --> 30:40.869
- Hook her up to the machine and find out.
- First things first.

30:40.953 --> 30:44.832
We find soldier boy, then we start
tinkering with the both of them.

30:44.913 --> 30:50.146
At the very least, we ought to have a fresh
supply of organs for our friends overseas.

30:54.673 --> 30:57.346
- Don't worry, love. You're not dead.
- Not yet.

30:57.713 --> 31:01.342
- What do you want from me?
- We want our boy back. Where is he?

31:01.793 --> 31:04.387
How should I know? He ran off on me.

31:05.953 --> 31:09.343
- Was she at the bar alone?
- Didn't notice.

31:09.433 --> 31:11.230
You, Tuck?

31:11.313 --> 31:14.988
- What was she doing when you took her?
- Getting a pitcher of beer.

31:15.073 --> 31:18.065
- Oh, a pitcher?
- Well, I'm a big drinker.

31:18.153 --> 31:20.348
Oh, shut up.

31:20.433 --> 31:21.513
Come here.

31:21.513 --> 31:21.751
Come here.

31:21.833 --> 31:23.232
Come here!

31:23.513 --> 31:27.631
It could be that our boy was there, too,
and right under your noses.

31:27.713 --> 31:31.752
- You check the back room?
- I didn't know there was one. You, Tuck?

31:32.593 --> 31:34.584
You twits!

31:35.473 --> 31:37.270
Lock her up.

31:37.353 --> 31:42.143
Don't worry, Eddy. This time we'll check
the back, the front, the whole place.

31:56.193 --> 31:59.549
- Once I get out, everyone's gonna...
- Get me outta here!

32:03.553 --> 32:05.544
Zack!

32:05.633 --> 32:08.022
Max! What did they do to you? Are you OK?

32:08.113 --> 32:10.183
I'm fine. Can you get these off me?

32:14.633 --> 32:17.943
I don't know what I'd have done
if anything had happened to you.

32:18.033 --> 32:21.184
- Zack.
- I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.662
Stop it!

32:23.753 --> 32:25.873
What's wrong? I love you.

32:25.873 --> 32:26.544
What's wrong? I love you.

32:26.633 --> 32:29.272
I want things to be
the way they used to be with us.

32:29.353 --> 32:31.947
Things were never like that with us.

32:34.033 --> 32:36.228
But I remember.

32:45.233 --> 32:46.985
It's him, isn't it?

32:47.073 --> 32:50.145
How can you love him and not me?
He betrayed us, Max!

32:54.833 --> 32:57.301
- What are you talking about? Who?
- Logan.

33:06.553 --> 33:10.182
He's been working against us.
That's why the mission went wrong.

33:10.273 --> 33:13.788
- Undo these handcuffs. We can talk...
- He's a traitor. Believe me!

33:13.873 --> 33:16.671
You're wrong.
They did something to you at Manticore.

33:16.753 --> 33:18.823
- I died for you!
- Zack.

33:18.913 --> 33:21.302
He did this to me!

33:21.393 --> 33:23.782
- He's the reason I'm like this!
- Zack!

33:25.953 --> 33:27.944
Stop it!

33:37.873 --> 33:40.341
Now he's gonna pay for what he did,

33:40.433 --> 33:42.424
to both of us.

33:43.753 --> 33:45.471
Zack! Zack!

33:47.073 --> 33:48.188
Zack!

34:04.753 --> 34:06.789
- Yeah.
- Get out of the apartment now!

34:07.353 --> 34:11.505
- Max, what's wrong?
- It's Zack. He's coming after you. Get out!

36:14.593 --> 36:16.584
Liar!

36:31.753 --> 36:34.506
- Zack, don't do this!
- Out of my way, Max.

37:45.433 --> 37:48.743
He's gonna be OK. Physically, anyway.

37:48.833 --> 37:53.111
- What do you mean?
- The cranial implant. It's still working.

37:53.193 --> 37:56.230
But the shock overloaded the circuitry.
It wiped it clean.

37:56.313 --> 37:58.463
Then...

37:58.553 --> 38:02.228
He won't remember anything
that happened since it was switched on.

38:02.313 --> 38:04.622
- Nothing?
- It'll be just like before.

38:04.713 --> 38:06.510
He won't recognise your face.

38:06.593 --> 38:10.552
Not unless he puts it together
with your name, and so on and so on.

38:10.633 --> 38:13.431
Then what? Everything else
will play out the same way?

38:13.513 --> 38:17.631
Whatever Manticore did to his head
to make him go after Logan is still in there.

38:17.713 --> 38:21.706
It's a pretty safe bet that
sooner or later, it'll happen again.

38:24.473 --> 38:27.226
- Can we have a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

38:30.473 --> 38:32.907
It doesn't have to play out the same way.

38:32.993 --> 38:36.110
Maybe this time we can
make him understand I'm not a threat.

38:36.193 --> 38:40.106
I need him, Logan. Now more than ever.
I don't wanna lose him.

38:42.353 --> 38:44.583
But I can't risk losing you.

38:52.673 --> 38:54.664
I have to let him go.

38:58.753 --> 39:02.666
I can use my contacts,
give him a new identity.

39:04.393 --> 39:06.987
He can get a fresh start somewhere else.

39:10.393 --> 39:12.429
A chance at a normal life.

39:12.513 --> 39:14.504
That's what he always wanted.

39:45.353 --> 39:47.344
You're awake.

39:50.873 --> 39:54.661
- Who are you?
- It's me. Buddy.

39:56.633 --> 39:58.624
You don't remember me?

40:00.433 --> 40:03.470
Well, Doctor Carr said this might happen.

40:04.273 --> 40:08.107
- Who?
- The doc that treated you after the accident.

40:08.193 --> 40:11.071
Said you might have some memory loss.

40:14.513 --> 40:17.073
Your name's Adam. Adam Thompson.

40:17.433 --> 40:19.742
You've worked on my ranch for three years.

40:19.833 --> 40:25.385
You were driving one of our trucks to Seattle
when a tyre blew, sent you right off the road.

40:25.473 --> 40:27.668
Any of this ringin' a bell?

40:30.233 --> 40:32.030
No.

40:33.273 --> 40:38.301
Well, Doc said it might take a while. What say
we hit the road? Get home in good time.

40:38.393 --> 40:42.181
Mary'll cook you up anything you want
for dinner. Sound good?

40:46.433 --> 40:49.027
Yeah. Actually, it does.

40:59.673 --> 41:01.584
Hold up.

41:02.833 --> 41:04.630
Do I know you?

41:05.953 --> 41:08.831
No. I don't think so.

41:43.033 --> 41:47.549
I think about Zack every day,
and I just hope that he's safe and happy,

41:47.633 --> 41:52.229
living the normal life he always wanted,
the life he deserves to have.

41:52.313 --> 41:54.986
Letting him go was the hardest thing
I've ever done,

41:55.073 --> 41:59.464
but sometimes you have to make sacrifices
to protect the ones you love.

42:00.473 --> 42:02.668
I learned that from my brother.

42:32.393 --> 42:35.510
