04:46.400 --> 04:51.748
"Bhaskar, run my bro, jump
my bro. He is coming, the rascal"

04:52.100 --> 04:55.741
"He will burst on touching, he'll kill
on touching, run, run run my bro"

04:56.400 --> 05:01.400
MBRHDRG

05:14.600 --> 05:16.341
'Muthalali' (The boss)

05:19.567 --> 05:22.070
Hello!
Muthalali, I'm Vikraman.

05:22.167 --> 05:23.737
Hello, what is it Vikraman?

05:24.233 --> 05:27.237
Excuse me, you are not
allowed to use phone here.

05:27.367 --> 05:29.745
No, it was an incoming call,
I didn't make a call to there.

05:30.067 --> 05:34.413
Shall I just say that? Hellow! Hey
fellow, phone is not allowed in here.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.308
I'm at Adhi's school.
Boss it's an urgent matter.

05:37.433 --> 05:39.413
Saying that we should not enter
inside, after securing a court order.

05:39.567 --> 05:42.070
He is inside now
with police protection.

05:42.233 --> 05:44.736
There are hit men also in
plenty what should we do next?

05:45.067 --> 05:47.069
What else to do other
than breaking his hand and legs.

05:47.267 --> 05:50.305
Can break only after getting inside, no?
- Fellow bring him out and beat.

05:50.467 --> 05:52.572
My boss, will anyone
come out to get the beatings?

05:52.767 --> 05:55.611
Tell him to show that, that
court order snatch that and run.

05:55.733 --> 05:58.270
At that time he will come out for it,
then we can beat him over there.

05:58.433 --> 06:00.037
Okay boss!

06:00.433 --> 06:04.643
How intelligent is this boss! No
doubt why I've not become a boss!

06:06.667 --> 06:08.078
Hey fellow, where are you going?

06:08.167 --> 06:10.078
Not that sir, wanted
to see court order again.

06:10.267 --> 06:12.543
I've shown all that earlier. -At that
time I was not wearing spectacles.

06:12.733 --> 06:15.373
And what about now? - Now also not taken
that's why said wants to see again.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.411
Sir just show that one.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.409
Bring it here.
Look and return fast.

06:19.567 --> 06:21.103
The matter is only this much!

06:23.067 --> 06:26.241
Not that sir, I'll go home and
take the spectacles and read this!

06:26.467 --> 06:29.448
Hey fellow stop.
Run and catch him.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.776
Stop there.
Run and catch him fellows.

06:35.733 --> 06:38.714
Hey fellow! Won't you come
out of the house? Is that so?

06:38.800 --> 06:43.374
Our boss has got the tricks
with him to bring you out, man!

06:43.467 --> 06:44.775
He is showing off with muscles!

06:45.067 --> 06:48.241
To whom did you ask and
wear cooling glass? Don't run!

06:48.600 --> 06:51.706
Stop it just stop it!

06:52.233 --> 06:55.373
Isn't it two days since kids
started screaming 'ho, ho'?

06:55.667 --> 06:59.479
Kids have learned all that! Now
even in the sleep kids say 'ho, ho'!

06:59.667 --> 07:03.308
Again what is to be taught is strike
and defense, strike, defense!

07:03.467 --> 07:05.708
That is required.
We can only teach like this.

07:06.033 --> 07:09.139
If sir can teach, go head you teach.
For that...

07:09.367 --> 07:10.437
Boss!

07:12.267 --> 07:15.248
Boss, the whack is coming
in an auto! Protect me!

07:16.300 --> 07:18.541
He is inside the school.
Don't leave him.

07:18.767 --> 07:22.271
Come fast.
Wait I'll teach you now.

07:22.467 --> 07:25.243
Okay. - Here is the court
order, here they comes!

07:26.267 --> 07:30.613
All of you must listen carefully.
Now imagine a group of hit men...

07:30.767 --> 07:32.303
...are coming to attack us.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.640
Hey fellow, come!
The first attack should be ours!

07:35.800 --> 07:38.110
The first attack...
Should be ours!

07:38.300 --> 07:40.302
Give that paper fellow.
Like this!

07:43.300 --> 07:46.611
That's the whack!
Then all will fall one after the other.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.145
But they won't go. They will
get up and come again.

07:49.367 --> 07:52.678
Look, like this! -At that time we should
take the left hand and hit like this.

07:53.033 --> 07:56.981
Then another fellow comes. Hold
him by right hand and hit him on ear!

07:57.633 --> 07:59.579
When jumps and comes
to beat, move back.

07:59.733 --> 08:02.737
Then hold his hand like this and
give a solid blow on his chest.

08:03.133 --> 08:04.271
Then break his leg by kicking.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.277
When one comes from back,
block like this. And give like this!

08:06.467 --> 08:08.777
And hold by hair and
give a throw like this!

08:17.467 --> 08:22.075
"Run my bro, jump bro.
He is coming, the rascal"

08:22.167 --> 08:24.010
"He will burst on touching,
he'll kill on touching"

08:36.267 --> 08:39.736
Bent him like that,just kill him.
Whatever be the case, I'll deal it.

08:48.133 --> 08:51.171
Who is this hero, man?
Hero! This is my papa!

08:54.367 --> 08:59.248
Make him flat like that! That's broken
now there is no use of marrying!

09:03.367 --> 09:07.281
Did you see? We should use the
physical force only on people...

09:07.367 --> 09:09.404
...who comes to attack us!
Did you understand?

09:13.733 --> 09:16.043
Here!
Take it and go.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.138
Go, go!

09:20.200 --> 09:23.374
Why, why is everyone gawking at?
Is everything become so beautiful?

09:27.467 --> 09:30.038
All go to classes. Go fast. Go.

09:30.233 --> 09:32.509
Adhi, when the class gets
over you shouldn't go, okay.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.136
You must introduce papa to me.

09:43.067 --> 09:46.605
Adhi please tell your father to go
out for the class to commence.

09:46.733 --> 09:49.976
Getting scared, what's this bringing
and beating up hit men over here?

09:50.167 --> 09:51.976
My goodness, sir I've not brought
them here and whacked.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.612
Thought, let it be a
demonstration for kids.

09:53.800 --> 09:57.247
Then what, what is the use of taking a
big risk? By bringing them here in auto.

09:57.433 --> 09:59.743
Now the students might have
understood everything and...

10:00.000 --> 10:02.378
...that is understood by tutor, is it not?
Who had called you over here?

10:02.500 --> 10:03.672
Go and attend the matter
on Abdul Razaq, you fellow.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.072
Okay boss don't know what's up
with Abdul Razaq on dealing with them!

10:07.333 --> 10:09.335
Tried to touch there.
Papa one minute.

10:09.533 --> 10:11.774
What? What is it boy?

10:12.600 --> 10:15.740
Papa didn't I say I don't want
to learn Karate and boxing?

10:16.067 --> 10:18.138
You are my son, you
must learn all this.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.610
If I've to learn Karate again,
papa shouldn't come here.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.570
Wait at the corridor
along with other parents.

10:22.767 --> 10:24.212
Won't I get bored boy?

10:25.100 --> 10:27.410
If at all to use phone at
that time someone will come.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.079
Saying phone can't be used.
Here.

10:29.267 --> 10:29.972
What is this?

10:30.100 --> 10:32.546
'Ravanan Kota' (Ravan's fort)
play this by the time I'll come.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.137
Keep it there.

10:34.400 --> 10:39.400
MBRHDRG

10:50.433 --> 10:53.141
Yea, mum my where are you?
Shivani!

10:53.333 --> 10:56.473
Yourtennis practice is it not over yet?
No mummy has started just now only.

10:56.633 --> 10:58.544
Mummy you come here,
all the parents are here.

10:58.733 --> 11:01.771
No Shivani I've got some mails to send.
I'll be there at the waiting area.

11:02.067 --> 11:04.013
Once it gets overjust phone me.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.210
Ha! Who told you to
come and sit here?

11:19.367 --> 11:21.540
Had put that in the
pocket again came out!

11:28.433 --> 11:33.314
Donkey! Sorry meant the
balls in the Ravan's fort!

11:43.600 --> 11:46.706
Hello, right now I'm at
the daughter's school.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.445
Over here the mobiles
aren't allowed to use.

11:50.033 --> 11:53.207
Don't move, don't move,
I said don't move!

11:53.600 --> 11:55.102
Go hell with it!

11:57.433 --> 11:59.743
Ravan's fort and his spheres!

12:08.733 --> 12:11.270
Just one call, its urgent that's why.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.343
Abdul Razaq how
are the things going?

12:17.433 --> 12:20.107
He was whacked.
But I'm at the hospital.

12:20.267 --> 12:22.440
How?
I had hit him with the head, my boss.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.137
He didn't know to block,
that stupid moved away.

12:25.267 --> 12:27.076
Then?
My head went and hitted the wall.

12:27.233 --> 12:29.406
Then it will break, no?
You go and take rest.

12:29.567 --> 12:30.568
What rest?

12:33.667 --> 12:36.614
Hello, what kind of
a lawyer are you?

12:37.067 --> 12:39.240
Without taking KV 8 and all.

12:41.600 --> 12:45.070
I'll send Vikraman over there
should send all the files with him.

12:45.267 --> 12:47.543
No need just listen
what I say. You fool.

12:51.300 --> 12:54.611
Hey mister on saying one call,
how many calls have you made now?

12:54.767 --> 12:56.713
All though the calls are
different, the case is the same.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.004
One tramp had gained a stay and
Abdul Razaq broke his head also.

13:00.133 --> 13:02.409
Its very serious.-No matter how
serious it is, stop making phone calls.

13:02.567 --> 13:04.046
Give that phone here,
should have manners, no?

13:04.233 --> 13:06.110
Madam, I called since
it is vacation over here.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.712
I don't want to know about your
case and vacation, give that phone here.

13:09.033 --> 13:10.103
Just one call, that's all.
Vikraman is there in the line.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.543
Are you returning the phone or not?

13:13.533 --> 13:15.206
Now you want this phone is it?
Yes.

13:15.333 --> 13:16.641
Here take it!

13:18.067 --> 13:20.104
What did you do? Do you know
how expensive this phone is?

13:20.300 --> 13:23.110
No matter how expensive phone is.
For you manners is more important, no?

13:23.300 --> 13:25.280
Go and pick it up, the manners!

13:27.600 --> 13:28.738
Rascal!

13:48.167 --> 13:55.585
'Bhaskar The Rascal'

14:08.033 --> 14:12.448
Hello. - Why did you leave? Didn't
I say, I wanted to meet your papa?

14:14.333 --> 14:17.041
Will you come to food court
at Oberon along with papa?

14:17.233 --> 14:19.270
Myself and mummy will be there.
Papa is too busy.

14:19.433 --> 14:21.413
All that can be done some other
time. -Who is that over the phone?

14:23.200 --> 14:25.305
Look papa, when a person
is talking over the phone...

14:25.433 --> 14:28.175
masking who, what and from
where that is not manners.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.675
You understand
that in the first place.

14:32.033 --> 14:34.240
Shivani, I'll call later bye.

14:39.200 --> 14:43.706
"The first baby should
be a boy child..."

14:44.033 --> 14:48.243
"...if any one sees him, they
should feel covetous"

14:48.800 --> 14:50.711
Can I turn off that radio?

14:54.100 --> 14:57.741
Papa did you become angry?
No, that is all right.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.979
So you became angry
no problem if it has happened.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.047
If I don't say this now papa
will repeat the same again.

15:04.133 --> 15:07.239
Then what will the people who
hears think? Papa is a culture less man.

15:07.633 --> 15:11.171
Now itself after taking papa's
permission only I've turned off this radio.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.746
That's manners.

15:15.133 --> 15:17.579
The one who called over the
phone is my best friend Shivani.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.675
Would you mind if I play this song?
Oh! Sorry!

15:22.200 --> 15:30.620
"A monkey who hops on the trees
wore the dress of a human being"

15:31.533 --> 15:34.241
These radio people
they don't have any manners.

15:34.967 --> 15:39.967
MBRHDRG

15:48.600 --> 15:51.979
Hey fellow! Here come the
chocolate company and daughter.

15:52.133 --> 15:54.409
Take this and go.
The rest we'll bring.

16:03.267 --> 16:04.507
Go man!

16:21.067 --> 16:25.538
Hey you! My god! - Shivani!
What's the problem?

16:25.633 --> 16:29.638
Has this girl gone mad? -Catching
my mom! - Shivani what are you saying?

16:29.767 --> 16:33.544
Then what doesn't his mother
have buttocks?-Get rid of this girl.

16:33.700 --> 16:36.442
That kid is not bad!
If you have guts, try touching her!

16:37.000 --> 16:39.071
Your mother is happy
then why are you mad?

16:54.167 --> 16:57.171
Wrote all that.
Only this much sir. - Okay.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.347
Mam, everything is okay.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.409
Mam!
Thank you.

17:14.133 --> 17:17.171
Are you angry as I didn't scold
him? What all things did you say?

17:17.367 --> 17:19.074
Shivani, from where did
you learn all this language?

17:19.233 --> 17:20.405
My language is the problem...

17:20.532 --> 17:23.412
...mummy don't you have any
worry as he caught you?

17:23.532 --> 17:25.740
What's the use of worrying?
Now did you see...

17:26.067 --> 17:29.412
...after having all those people there
did anyone come to question?

17:30.100 --> 17:32.046
That's our society.

17:34.100 --> 17:38.071
By the way every day you are going
alone to school, I'm also alone.

17:38.233 --> 17:40.008
We don't know who they are and
from where they are coming...

17:40.133 --> 17:46.243
...we know nothing. If they harm me
or you who is there for us to ask?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.546
You have this.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.243
So you also think in the same
manner how that jerk thinks is it?

17:57.333 --> 17:59.040
That I enjoy all this.

18:02.700 --> 18:07.115
No need don't cry on account
of that. I'll eat this one.

18:07.467 --> 18:12.467
MBRHDRG

18:22.200 --> 18:27.980
Hello, call later I'm very busy.
What busyness for you?

18:28.167 --> 18:30.704
Am I the one sitting and
doing all this work?

18:31.067 --> 18:33.411
Instead of making me
sign like an imposition.

18:33.567 --> 18:36.514
I've been telling you to transfer
all this in your name, didn't I?

18:36.633 --> 18:40.240
Father you may do all that, if I make
ten signs, all the ten will be different.

18:46.733 --> 18:49.179
Hey fellow didn't I say
call after some time?

18:49.367 --> 18:50.573
Who is that on the phone, man?

18:50.767 --> 18:52.747
Look, when a person
speaks over the phone.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.174
It's not manners on asking who is it
what is it and from where and all.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.574
You learn that first of all. What's the
use of going to London and studying?

18:58.733 --> 19:01.236
Should have manners.
This is what children also learns.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.641
Tell and snap it whatever it is!

19:04.033 --> 19:07.173
This is nothing else. Today when
Shivani's phone call came...

19:07.367 --> 19:09.973
...for asking who and
what I gave a small dose.

19:10.167 --> 19:11.646
He used that against grandpa.

19:12.633 --> 19:17.981
No doubt I also thought how come
he gained common sense so fast?

19:18.400 --> 19:21.574
Grandpa, from where did
you get a son like this?

19:21.733 --> 19:23.303
Boy, what is that my son lacks?

19:23.433 --> 19:26.414
No, nothing is lacking,
everything is bit excess.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.377
So far grandpa used to
come to my school, is it?

19:30.533 --> 19:34.481
Yea. - This time to pick me up for
vacation why did you send papa?

19:35.433 --> 19:37.242
Papa ruined everything.

19:37.367 --> 19:39.677
Saying, since Adhi's papa
is coming here for first time.

19:41.767 --> 19:43.747
On the national level, the
award for the best student.

19:44.067 --> 19:46.604
Adhi is going to bring that
to our school for the first time.

19:52.100 --> 19:55.445
Papa, I don't want Karate. I'll learn
music. - Then learn music also.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.511
When men who comes to
fight can beat them by singing.

19:57.700 --> 20:00.579
What is the fees for both courses?
Sixty thousand.

20:05.100 --> 20:09.173
My god what a stupid fellow
is he? He will tarnish our respect!

20:09.333 --> 20:10.368
This is what happened
at the school.

20:10.467 --> 20:12.674
On the way back after that
created problems at the bakery also.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.541
Which bakery and
what was the problem?

20:14.733 --> 20:17.236
That Best Bakery is there, no?
Where we always used to buy sweets.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.074
Due to my bad luck, I had told
I wanted a pastry from there.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.578
Give that here.
Three chocolate pastry also.

20:23.767 --> 20:27.237
Where is grandpa? Has not seen
him for long.-He is there at home.

20:27.533 --> 20:29.137
Then who is he?
Is he the new driver?

20:33.567 --> 20:35.513
No, this is my papa.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.746
Too bad is this your papa?

20:41.133 --> 20:43.477
Hey fellow did you like my looks?

20:44.600 --> 20:47.342
No, no need.
What no need? Take it fellow!

20:47.500 --> 20:50.140
Don't beat. Didn't I say not to beat?

20:50.300 --> 20:52.746
No need to beat?
Yea. - If then I'll hit you man.

20:53.333 --> 20:56.109
What are you doing? There are
people like us, over here to ask.

20:56.233 --> 20:57.974
So you people have come to ask
and collect whack, is it? - Yes!

20:58.133 --> 20:59.407
Then take it!

21:00.533 --> 21:04.003
Hey fellow! - Mother!
He and his auto-rickshaw.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.340
My goodness what is
wrong with him?

21:08.467 --> 21:10.708
Above all this, again he
created issues at the school.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.111
What problem?-Saying karate
master doesn't teach properly.

21:14.267 --> 21:18.238
Quarreled with them. Then Vikraman
chettan brought some hit men...

21:18.333 --> 21:20.279
...from somewhere and
started a fight over there.

21:20.467 --> 21:22.504
Hey Vikraman didn't I tell
you that I can't come?

21:22.633 --> 21:24.772
Tomorrow I should take
Adhi and go to Trivandrum.

21:25.133 --> 21:26.612
To collect the award
for beautiful student.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.110
Look, he is discussing about
coming with me to Trivandrum.

21:29.267 --> 21:32.248
My goodness in this hotness
if he goes to Trivandrum...

21:32.367 --> 21:34.347
...he might even
stampede the ministry.

21:34.500 --> 21:38.607
Grandpa, honestly if tomorrow papa
comes with me to receive the award.

21:38.767 --> 21:41.475
He will be little me surely
in front of everyone.

21:41.667 --> 21:44.079
Grandpa, please do something.

21:44.133 --> 21:47.945
You don't get tensed, I'll
cancel the matter at Trivandrum.

21:53.100 --> 21:55.080
Hello...
What is it Rajappa?

21:55.267 --> 21:58.077
Boss, this won't work out.
You collect the advance and keep.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.235
No boss on the mentioned
amount it's not possible.

22:00.367 --> 22:03.075
I won't receive advance also.
Then you fix the amount. - No.

22:03.267 --> 22:06.339
All that is not possible and
later it will become a big scene.

22:08.033 --> 22:11.071
Is that Abdul Razaq present over
there? - Yes he is here.

22:11.200 --> 22:14.306
Give the phone to him.
Here. - Hello!

22:14.567 --> 22:18.242
Hey Abdul Razaq. - What is it boss?
You give a blow on his face!

22:18.333 --> 22:20.006
Okay boss.
Mother!

22:22.800 --> 22:25.576
Boos, had whacked him!
Now give that phone to him.

22:26.667 --> 22:30.205
Here! - What do you say Rajappa?
I'll collect the advance boss.

22:34.467 --> 22:36.208
Tell, tell. - Have seen several
kinds of whacks...

22:36.333 --> 22:39.473
...giving a whack over the
mobile seeing for the first time.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.644
You get ready morning
itself, we must go to a place.

22:48.767 --> 22:50.644
Morning? Morning I should take
Adhi to Trivandrum, isn't it?

22:50.800 --> 22:53.337
Stencillavos, will do that. - I had
given two months leave to Stencillavos.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.740
And he was told to go
on leave by me, isn't it?

22:55.033 --> 22:57.206
I'll call him back.
He'll go.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.381
My son receiving the award, its not
the driver Stencillavos, who should see.

23:00.567 --> 23:01.272
I should see.

23:01.433 --> 23:03.379
Didn't father tell me that I should be
with him for this whole vacation?

23:03.567 --> 23:05.046
Then how come you
are talking differently?

23:07.133 --> 23:11.172
If you go it won't be right. Adhi
is not ready to come with you.

23:12.100 --> 23:15.309
Can't blame him, your
actions support that isn't it?

23:15.667 --> 23:19.205
Now he is ashamed to say
that he is your father.

23:19.467 --> 23:24.467
MC Movie Channel

23:32.367 --> 23:35.507
Grandpa, did you say that?
Yea, told.

23:40.533 --> 23:45.448
On a night like this when your
grandma compelled I went and told him.

23:45.667 --> 23:48.011
To run away from
here to somewhere.

23:48.300 --> 23:53.409
At that time he was only 6 years
older than your present age.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.242
As my business collapsed...

23:56.433 --> 24:02.111
...I couldn't face debtors coming and
shouting in front of the house.

24:02.433 --> 24:06.006
Myself and his mother
decided to commit suicide.

24:06.633 --> 24:09.637
After giving him some
money which was with me.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.280
I told him to go and
escape somewhere.

24:13.333 --> 24:19.306
But not only he didn't leave
he guarded us that whole night.

24:19.600 --> 24:25.073
At dawn he took me
before all the debtors and he...

24:25.167 --> 24:27.078
<i>"gained some more 'time.</i>

24:27.600 --> 24:31.707
Three months, six months,
one year and so on like that.

24:32.067 --> 24:35.640
With that small money which
I gave he entered in the market.

24:35.767 --> 24:41.115
After that it was a war, he made
money. Beyond which I perished.

24:41.267 --> 24:45.010
Several folds higher than what
my fore fathers created. But...

24:45.133 --> 24:47.704
In his name there
isn't any establishments.

24:48.100 --> 24:53.311
Everything is in my name not to change
into his name, hisjustification is.

24:53.600 --> 24:58.242
When he signs in ten different
places, will be in ten different types.

25:00.067 --> 25:01.011
Nothing at all...

25:01.433 --> 25:07.748
...he had decided that my head
shouldn't be lowered before any one.

25:10.267 --> 25:16.047
As he said no to marriage, myself
and his mother compelled him to marry.

25:16.233 --> 25:22.673
That too a late marriage. After giving
birth to you, after two years she expired.

25:23.234 --> 25:25.737
Then it was your grandma
who grew you up.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.504
When you were six years
old, she also departed us.

25:30.067 --> 25:35.380
Both had expired by lying on his lap.
On that day I cried like anything.

25:35.533 --> 25:39.071
Even at that time I
didn't see his eyes filled.

25:39.234 --> 25:43.080
But today I saw his
eyes filled with tears.

25:43.467 --> 25:49.110
When I said you are ashamed
to say that he is your father.

25:59.567 --> 26:04.209
I've told driver Stencillavos to
cancel the leave and return.

26:04.367 --> 26:07.473
Tomorrow you go to
Trivandrum along with him.

26:12.433 --> 26:16.313
Yea get in, get in.
Okay leave.

26:17.167 --> 26:22.344
Wait there is a person to get in.

26:23.467 --> 26:26.539
I'll kill. Stay here.

26:29.467 --> 26:32.073
'Vellamadikunnu, marikunnu'
(Drinking liquor, dying)

26:32.233 --> 26:35.305
What all other good things are
there to write and keep, dirty ones.

26:37.433 --> 26:41.245
Where is it? To wear this one. On
holding to that side will come here.

26:41.434 --> 26:45.439
This owners and liquors are the
same. Won't allot a free time.

26:46.267 --> 26:50.238
Brother, did the last bus go?
One last bus is gone. - My god.

26:50.367 --> 26:53.177
Worry not there is last
bus every now and then.

26:55.500 --> 26:58.709
Should I help?
If you don't mind, just hold. - Okay.

27:01.167 --> 27:03.306
So you are also drunk, isn't it?
You are bit over.

27:03.433 --> 27:04.741
Me?
What time is it?

27:05.233 --> 27:09.181
Here comes the next last bus.
He is he bidding bye to vehicle?

27:09.300 --> 27:11.405
Just move back, don't
be under the vehicle!

27:11.600 --> 27:14.513
Stop, stop, stop fellow!
Stopped.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.511
On showing the hand
here stopping there isn't it?

27:17.433 --> 27:21.575
Come the bus has come. - Rani Mol.
Chetta, are you coming?

27:23.467 --> 27:27.745
How? He is simply.
Okay right.

27:30.167 --> 27:33.410
I was the one who showed the hand,
some other person was picked up.

27:33.500 --> 27:37.539
Fools, 'Rani' (Queen) you be here.
Can go when the next last bus comes.

27:41.067 --> 27:45.243

27:45.434 --> 27:49.507

27:49.667 --> 27:51.647
What is he doing?
Go, go.

27:52.367 --> 27:56.611
To Stencillavos...
Mocking by weaving the hand?

27:56.767 --> 27:58.713
If you are drunk that should be
inside the tummy. You drunkard!

27:59.200 --> 28:02.613
This is the thing, on showing
the hand there will stop here.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.041
On coming and standing here
the vehicle will stop there.

28:05.233 --> 28:06.678
And the blame is on liquor!

28:06.900 --> 28:15.081
MBRHDRG

28:15.167 --> 28:19.309
Christ! Its making a noise. Is it

Boss told you'll come by 10 o'clock.
Its not 10, its only 3:30.

28:27.667 --> 28:28.372
Not that.

28:28.634 --> 28:31.581
On telling will reach at 10 o'clock at
night, got bored and I drank the liquor.

28:33.267 --> 28:36.111
Hello will the auto leave now?
Where to go?

28:36.267 --> 28:38.042
Where are you going at the
mid-night on calling an auto?

28:38.234 --> 28:40.339
I want to close the gate.
Are you going in an auto to close gate?

28:40.533 --> 28:43.639
Walk and go to close the gate.
Hey fellow Vikrama. - Boss! Come.

28:44.067 --> 28:46.104
What is it a meeting
at the mid-night?

28:46.300 --> 28:48.211
Boss, they reached now only.
Didn't I see that?

28:49.133 --> 28:50.635
What is that?

28:50.800 --> 28:54.976
Ranika beer, owner Bhaskaran had
called at night and purchased this.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.545
The owner is deeply hurt.
Then you go and give.

28:58.200 --> 29:01.079
Then wash the vehicle and keep.

29:01.267 --> 29:03.474

Adhi to Trivandrum.

29:03.633 --> 29:05.579
Why did you give this to me?
Must wash the car, no?

29:05.767 --> 29:08.976
Can wash the car in the morning.
First you settle that auto. - Boss!

29:09.300 --> 29:13.112
No money to pay off the auto.
Hey accountant settle that auto's cash.

Okay boss, come.

29:34.434 --> 29:36.243
This vehicle was hired
from the Calicut stand.

29:36.433 --> 29:37.434
From Calicut?

29:38.300 --> 29:40.405
Hey man will any one call an auto
from Calicut and come here?

29:40.567 --> 29:43.605
I have come, haven't I?
At least can't you make him understand?

29:44.067 --> 29:45.011
For that should receive a gap, no?

29:45.133 --> 29:46.771
Sitting at the back
he was using cuss words.

29:47.100 --> 29:48.306
Why did you use abusive
words on this poor fellow?

29:48.433 --> 29:50.709
Not me, some
unknown Vikraman.

29:51.367 --> 29:53.608

29:54.100 --> 29:56.080

29:56.200 --> 29:58.510
No problem is it? But still the

29:58.700 --> 30:01.772

30:30.200 --> 30:32.305
Hey security throw him

30:32.467 --> 30:33.673
Why are you running
by ringing the bells?

30:40.200 --> 30:41.440
Hello.
Have you started?

30:41.700 --> 30:45.512
Now at the pump, Stencillavos
chettan is filling the fuel.

30:45.733 --> 30:47.440
So are you leaving without papa?

30:48.467 --> 30:52.074
Hey man didn't I tell you not to hurt
papa? Should only go with papa.

30:52.167 --> 30:55.705
Going with papa only.
Really? Poor one.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.071
All though you have hurted that
much papa came with you, no?

30:58.200 --> 31:01.670
That is the greatness of your papa.
Okay he is coming I'll call later.

31:02.033 --> 31:04.013
Or else will keep on
asking who is it and what is it.

31:04.234 --> 31:05.736
Shall we go?
Can I drive the cal'?

31:06.100 --> 31:08.478
For that the program
is today not next week.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.738
Sit at the back.

31:19.100 --> 31:22.775
Boss its Vikraman, that
Rajappan again changed his stand.

31:23.134 --> 31:25.512
He had fixed the deal
with a person from Mangalore.

31:25.633 --> 31:30.048
Is that Razaq present over there?
Boss he says you come with 5 men.

31:30.133 --> 31:32.613
No, not that. Its only a matter
of 5 minutes tell him to come.

31:32.767 --> 31:35.270
Sorry its only a matter of
5 minutes just come over here.

31:35.433 --> 31:37.106
The moment they see the
boss they will disperse.

31:37.233 --> 31:38.234
Hey man can't you
understand on saying?

31:38.333 --> 31:40.244
Along with Adhi I'm
going to Trivandrum.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.074
After this matter, boss
you go to Trivandrum.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.770
Boss you come and
just put the start.

31:45.133 --> 31:47.443
The balance will be ended by
Razaq. - My goodness, I alone.

31:48.267 --> 31:52.079
Boss one idea, I'll
take Adhi to Trivandrum.

31:52.200 --> 31:55.443
Better than that its better to
tell Trivandrum to come here.

31:55.667 --> 31:58.045
Adhiten minutes we'll
go there and come.

31:58.200 --> 32:00.476
Papa we should reach

32:00.633 --> 32:02.237
Boy can reach there.

32:03.134 --> 32:05.273
Now the things are okay.

32:05.533 --> 32:09.003
"Jump my bro, rascal is coming"-You

32:09.167 --> 32:10.737
Papa won't we reach there on time?

32:11.034 --> 32:15.039
You sit looking at the watch,

32:20.100 --> 32:22.580
Owner Bhaskar we are the ones
who saw this property at first.

32:22.733 --> 32:24.644
If you have seen that, you should
have fixed that at that time itself.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.337
When someone else gives the
advance, don't give on top of that.

32:27.467 --> 32:28.775
Owner, they have
committed it earlier.

32:29.100 --> 32:31.603
We've come from
Mangalore to buy this property.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.536
You will buy and I'll sell that also.

32:33.667 --> 32:35.738
Don't scare okay.
What will you do on scaring?

32:36.067 --> 32:37.137
Don't do anything.

32:41.233 --> 32:45.443

"He will burst on touching, he'll kill

33:21.167 --> 33:23.238
A fellow that doesn't value words.

33:34.134 --> 33:36.375
In that also owner's dress.
Why so much dress?

33:36.467 --> 33:37.537
Going for a long journey is it?

33:37.734 --> 33:39.975
No one knows how many
dress changes will be there.

33:40.100 --> 33:42.341
Papa no need to change the dress
and all. There is no use of going now.

33:42.467 --> 33:45.744
Already its two hours late. For usto
reach there we must go in a helicopter.

33:46.267 --> 33:49.248
Abdul Razaq! - Is the 'mundu'

33:49.367 --> 33:51.677

Helicopter for what?

33:51.767 --> 33:53.576
Is it to spray fertilizers?
No problem if it sprays fertilizers.

33:53.667 --> 33:56.113
I and Adhi should reach Trivandrum.
Make it fast don't land here.

33:56.300 --> 33:59.076
Land there in that police
ground near the high way.

34:07.633 --> 34:10.580
Lot of clouds are there when the
helicopter comes can we see that?

34:11.100 --> 34:12.408

34:15.734 --> 34:19.580
Hello, have you gone?

We are waiting for the helicopter.

34:27.400 --> 34:31.348

34:31.699 --> 34:35.580

34:47.233 --> 34:48.974
How lucky he is.

34:49.266 --> 34:53.215
Owner that fool Razaq is going
alone to Trivandrum without taking us.

34:53.367 --> 34:55.438

34:55.667 --> 34:59.114
Hey Razaq where are you going?

34:59.300 --> 35:01.576
To come back, hey fellow
I'm coming to there only.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.542
Saying coming here

35:03.700 --> 35:05.043
Hey man ambulance

35:05.233 --> 35:08.009
I saw your vehicle. - After seeing the
vehicle, where are you going?

35:08.200 --> 35:11.079
Why are you not coming here?
Reached?-Where have you reached?

35:11.167 --> 35:13.773
Reached here.

35:14.134 --> 35:15.477
Standing here can't you see?

35:16.067 --> 35:17.102

35:19.533 --> 35:20.773

35:31.367 --> 35:34.109
No, 5:30 is not possible must

35:34.267 --> 35:36.975
Won't you reach there at 6 o'clock?

35:37.167 --> 35:40.239
All get inside. Come on boy Adhi.
I'll get in along with Razaq Ekka.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.073
Come son. - You park the
vehicle and sit at the back.

35:42.634 --> 35:47.634
MBRHDRG

35:53.300 --> 35:55.246
Hello.
Have you got inside the helicopter'?

35:55.467 --> 35:59.415
Then what we are all flying?
What all? Who and all?

35:59.567 --> 36:02.411
Do you want to hear?
Hello, I'm Abdul Razaq.

36:02.567 --> 36:04.706
I'm Stencillavous. Is it correct?
Yes correct.

36:05.300 --> 36:08.474
What did you hear? - Inside the
helicopter is there phone signal?

36:08.600 --> 36:10.580
Then so far have you
not reached on top?

36:10.667 --> 36:14.114
We haven't reached but one
person has reached on top earlier.

36:14.267 --> 36:15.473
We are going with him.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.341
From top has come down.

36:17.434 --> 36:19.004
Then why are you not
reaching on top?

36:19.134 --> 36:21.546
Time has not come
call after some time.

36:21.734 --> 36:24.340
At that time if we aren't available,
then think we have reached on top.

36:24.467 --> 36:25.605
Hey man.
Isn't it true?

36:27.734 --> 36:30.738
Who is he of yours?
This is brother in law. This is sister.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.741
Is this sister'?
Hey man!

36:33.100 --> 36:35.580
This is my brother in law.
It was from here, is it not?

36:35.734 --> 36:39.580
What happened?
What more to happen, more than this.

36:40.100 --> 36:41.738
It was from here is it?

36:42.067 --> 36:44.638
How did he die? - When we were
coming back after drinks.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.076
Brother in law wanted to
have a tender coconut.

36:47.234 --> 36:49.236
Climbed the tree to
pluck the tender coconut.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.676
After drinking the liquor
might have slipped is it?

36:51.767 --> 36:55.408
On holding like this he is a person
who doesn't leave even on dying.

36:55.633 --> 36:58.239
Now see even in that position
he has not left the hold.

36:58.367 --> 37:00.244
That's true then what happened?

37:00.400 --> 37:02.573
While climbing up
the coconut tree ended.

37:02.734 --> 37:04.145
Coconut tree got finished? Yes.

37:04.367 --> 37:06.506
That was a tree which has
lost its head due to lightening.

37:06.700 --> 37:09.738
He climbed up and
straight away fell down.

37:10.100 --> 37:12.774
Then where is he?
He is the present Palaghat Thahsildar.

37:13.534 --> 37:20.713
To inaugurate 'Edufest' famous
cine star Rani Kabeer will reach now.

37:21.367 --> 37:25.338
Here man. - No need sir. Take it man.
Are you driving free of cost?

37:25.500 --> 37:28.606
Here.
A great help for dropping us here.

37:28.800 --> 37:32.748
Sir, we should thank you is it?
At night we were to reach at 7:30.

37:33.067 --> 37:34.705
We reached here by 5:30.

37:34.767 --> 37:40.479
Like this if he was taken to hospital
half an hour back he wouldn't die.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.409
If he wouldn't have
died, I would have died.

37:42.534 --> 37:45.242
If this ambulance was not received
on time, owner would have killed me.

37:45.333 --> 37:46.403
Come, come.
That's what is said.

37:46.500 --> 37:49.970
Okay let the vehicle go.
Asking out of grief, are you married?

37:50.167 --> 37:54.013
Yes married, the married one
is lying here. - Is it? My mother!

37:54.167 --> 37:54.736
Then what?

38:21.434 --> 38:23.778
Who is this?
Owner this is Vani Mukarjee.

38:24.300 --> 38:25.677
Is she the one?

38:27.667 --> 38:29.476
Just move, let me just go.

38:32.700 --> 38:34.646
My goodness can't go this way.

38:35.467 --> 38:40.075
Miss Rani Kabeer, its viral on social
media that you are in love. Is it true?

38:40.167 --> 38:41.510
Madam can you reveal
who that one is?

38:41.634 --> 38:43.045
Is it any one from the cinema field?

38:44.034 --> 38:47.311
That is true I'm in love with a person.

38:48.467 --> 38:51.073
He has got no connection
with cinema and all.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.409
He has got one child also.
There is no way there also.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.672
Can't go this way. - Actually
helicopter is required here only.

38:57.767 --> 38:59.212
There is no way to that side also.
What to do next?

38:59.267 --> 39:01.247
<i>Madam can you say who
that</i> one <i>is? -Is he a Malayali?</i>

39:01.400 --> 39:02.777
Will the marriage take place
very soon, miss Rani Kabeel'?

39:04.034 --> 39:05.741
Papa is this the car in

39:06.000 --> 39:07.638

to other side. You come.

39:08.067 --> 39:09.546
That is a good idea.
You get in.

39:09.734 --> 39:11.577

the questions are coming behind!

39:22.700 --> 39:25.237

39:46.067 --> 39:48.047

...now says she is your
heart throb, is it true?

39:51.767 --> 39:55.738
Asking about Rani Ka beer. Why
should we hide it? Say it openly.

39:56.067 --> 39:57.978
How did they know it?
This is their routine job.

39:58.700 --> 40:01.442
Its true. - Owner also say

40:01.634 --> 40:05.639
When did Rani Kabeer enter your
life? -After the death of my wife.

40:05.734 --> 40:07.372
So has this love started
from there on?

40:07.633 --> 40:10.079
At first there was no much
liking and then later...

40:10.267 --> 40:12.304
When owner is mentally upset
owner calls and tells me.

40:12.500 --> 40:16.448
No matter how night it is I'll find out
and secretly bring into the room.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.409
The big boss doesn't like all this.

40:18.534 --> 40:21.071

42:23.467 --> 42:26.073
Have you shot all this?
Papa all this is the news.

42:26.567 --> 42:29.070

On a function in which
they both participated...

42:36.767 --> 42:41.079
...Bhaskar and Rani Kabeer
exposed their wedding news.

42:48.100 --> 42:51.081
It was a good musical
concert okay. Is it not?

42:51.300 --> 42:53.678
Not musical concert, a percussion.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.240
I got mixed up with both.

42:55.367 --> 42:59.076
The boss. Hello!
Abdul Razaq where are you?

42:59.300 --> 43:03.214
I'm in the auditorium itself.

43:03.300 --> 43:04.404
...as soon as possible

43:04.467 --> 43:07.004
One vehicle is required.
Is an Ambulance needed?

43:07.100 --> 43:09.046
Most probably its required.
Okay.

43:09.434 --> 43:12.005
'Actress Rani Kabeer
is getting married'.

43:12.100 --> 43:14.637
'An end to gossips, actress Rani
Kabeer is from now on Rani Bhaskar'

43:15.767 --> 43:19.579
Is it to do this stupidity with two suit
cases of dress at the morning itself...

43:19.734 --> 43:22.237
...have you started from here
along with these monkies?

43:22.467 --> 43:25.710
I didn't go okay.
If you had gone it would be worst.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.980
Could have told I had gone, is it?
Don't talk.

43:28.434 --> 43:32.905
MBRHDRG

43:33.300 --> 43:36.042
Hello.
I'm the manager of Rani Kabeer madam.

43:36.167 --> 43:37.510
Is there owner Bhaskar?

43:38.367 --> 43:41.143
Can't talk now the
owner is in big tension.

43:41.267 --> 43:44.737
Call after some time. - Hey fellow
other than to make money and to fight.

43:45.034 --> 43:48.413
What is the use of you? Is it to do
lot of stupid things like this?

43:50.167 --> 43:53.239
In this stinking case my name was
also dragged and ridiculed me, no?

43:53.333 --> 43:56.405
Both the print and channel people.
Boss can we give a correction?

43:56.500 --> 43:59.071
What correction? That I'm
not his father, is it?

43:59.200 --> 44:01.407
That is not needed.
Get lost you donkey, palm civet.

44:02.267 --> 44:04.975
Hey fellow where are you going?
Told to go.

44:05.167 --> 44:09.115
What an obedience?
Are you a driver or a pimp?

44:09.233 --> 44:13.978
At night to bring it here secretly.
I told about Ranika beer.

44:14.134 --> 44:16.614
Will anyone with sense put a name
Ranika beer for a film actress?

44:16.667 --> 44:19.511
That's the problem.
Its not Ranika beer.

44:19.600 --> 44:23.412
Its Rani Kabeer.
Still now he hasn't understood this.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.071
Hello.

44:28.334 --> 44:31.372
Didn't I say can't talk right now?
Who is that fellow?

44:32.167 --> 44:35.979

44:40.467 --> 44:43.380
Hello.

44:43.567 --> 44:45.376
To say such kinds of
things about me.

44:45.467 --> 44:47.970
That is...
I haven't seen you before, no?

44:48.200 --> 44:52.171
Then why did you harass

44:52.334 --> 44:58.114
No, young lady I'm his father.
Banker Shankar Narayanan. That is..

44:58.234 --> 45:02.011
He made a mistake. There is
a beer named Ranika beer.

45:02.134 --> 45:04.546
Everything told by him
was about that one.

45:04.667 --> 45:08.046
What is the use of saying
all that? Person who loved me...

45:08.334 --> 45:10.712
...believed all this.
And he left with animosity.

45:11.034 --> 45:16.313
Don't worry thinking all that on this
issue your marriage will not be canceled.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.402
That I'll take care.

45:22.367 --> 45:25.405
This is the big boss, I was
about to tell this to you.

45:25.800 --> 45:29.441
As far as I heard Rani
Kabeefs family is a best family.

45:30.100 --> 45:32.080
Father is a Muslim and
mother is a Punjabi.

45:32.167 --> 45:36.445
Brother is a Christian. Luckily only
Rani Kabeer is a Hindu, okay.

45:36.567 --> 45:39.673
Anyway as it has reached
this far we'll conduct this one.

45:39.767 --> 45:42.111
If I kick you, you will land in Punjab!

45:42.300 --> 45:47.374
Before kicking him you go and find
that film actress's lover where ever he is.

45:47.467 --> 45:49.208
Talk and make the things understandable...

45:49.334 --> 45:51.780
...put their relationship like before.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.037
With that this stinking case
will be over, won't it?

45:54.234 --> 45:58.080
Vikaraman, come man. From some
where we'll nab that lover, boss.

45:58.200 --> 46:00.407
And he'll be brought here. Come.
Get lost you fellows!

46:02.100 --> 46:05.707
If you go with this tom
fools should go on that way.

46:05.800 --> 46:07.245
Never come here.

46:17.800 --> 46:20.007
Mr. Bhaskar what is the
intention of this arrival?

46:20.067 --> 46:22.343
<i>Sir, its true that Sidharth Menu“
and Ram Kaheer separated.</i>

46:22.567 --> 46:25.207
Are you still in love?
You stay here.

46:25.400 --> 46:28.313
I'll go inside and talk to him.
After that we'll come out...

46:28.500 --> 46:30.411
...and both of us will
jointly give a statement.

46:30.634 --> 46:32.113
Give the way.

46:33.500 --> 46:36.709
To request to move away from
the life of actress Rani Kabeer.

46:36.800 --> 46:40.270
Owner Bhaskar has directly
come to Siddharth Menon's office.

46:40.400 --> 46:44.644
For the channel along with
camera man Saji, Biju Ragav.

46:45.600 --> 46:49.013
Sir. - Yes.
Owner Bhaskar has come to meet.

46:49.767 --> 46:52.338
Tell can't meet now on
a conference. - Okay sir.

46:52.634 --> 46:55.114
Then we'll fix that okay.
Okay sir.

46:55.267 --> 46:57.508
Where are you going?
Sorry, sorry thank you.

46:57.600 --> 47:00.274
Pardon me I've not
come for my own matter.

47:01.034 --> 47:03.378
Without knowing I was involved
into a family matter of yours.

47:03.467 --> 47:05.344
The main reason for that
is the name of the beer...

47:05.500 --> 47:06.672
...that I drink and your
Iovefs name is identical.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.570
On that both of us are not offenders.

47:09.100 --> 47:12.081
I came to clear the
misunderstanding on account of that.

47:20.734 --> 47:24.978
A new twist to the marriage news
of well known film actress Rani Kabeer.

47:25.067 --> 47:26.478
Yes, the issue is solved.

47:26.567 --> 47:32.074
To settle the issue the new
lover bet the old lover in his office.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.571
Again he has created
this into trouble.

47:40.234 --> 47:45.081
Our correspondent is there in
the line. Biju. - Yes can hear Ratheesh.

47:45.134 --> 47:48.411
Biju what is happening over there?

47:48.500 --> 47:54.007
Ratheesh fighting scenes that are
not seen in films are going on there.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.776
There is only one person who is
left behind for not getting his beat.

48:00.234 --> 48:01.406
This me!

48:12.100 --> 48:14.740
So from now on this is your mother.

48:16.300 --> 48:19.144
Hey fellow when is your papa's
and new mum my's wedding?

48:19.700 --> 48:22.271
Why are you gawking
at your mother'?

48:22.434 --> 48:25.711
If you have anything to
ask, not Adhi ask Adhi's papa.

48:25.800 --> 48:27.780
Move back fellow.
Adhi you go.

48:33.100 --> 48:34.704
Who are you girl?
Are you Mary Kom?

48:37.067 --> 48:38.671
If I don't take hands off?
You will clear off.

48:39.400 --> 48:40.310
Hey you!

48:42.434 --> 48:44.243
Leave fellow.
Open it.

48:44.433 --> 48:46.310
If I don't take the hand off?
You'll take it off.

48:47.300 --> 48:49.041
Then you try to take it off.

48:49.767 --> 48:51.144
Open it.

48:51.700 --> 48:53.179
Hey fellow open it.

48:55.434 --> 48:56.572
My God!

48:57.400 --> 48:59.073
Run man, run.

49:10.167 --> 49:12.613
Doctor please don't
make this into an issue.

49:12.767 --> 49:15.714
Your prodigal child after
creating all this issues.

49:15.800 --> 49:18.280
Now are you telling me
not to make it into an issue?

49:18.467 --> 49:21.573
Look Adhi's papa has also come
now all the parents are present.

49:23.100 --> 49:25.307
What is the problem?
Didn't you see what is done?

49:25.434 --> 49:27.744
My son's teeth is shaken by hitting
broke the bridge of the nose.

49:29.767 --> 49:31.747
Who?
Is standing there.

49:53.700 --> 49:55.702
What's the name?
Vishwa.

49:56.000 --> 49:56.705
If its upsetting don't say.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.446
Not upsetting he said
his name Vishwajith.

50:00.534 --> 50:02.571
Why did Viswajith
receive her beating?

50:02.734 --> 50:04.441
For that did he ask
and get the beating?

50:04.567 --> 50:06.740
The beating is not to
receive that is to give.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.980
And if at all he has received
the beating he might...

50:09.234 --> 50:10.679
...have given the stick for that.

50:11.267 --> 50:13.213
Daughter why did you
hit this Vishwajith?

50:13.300 --> 50:17.248
When myself and Adhi was walking
and coming Vishwajith harassed us.

50:17.367 --> 50:18.744
To harass where is
the respect for you?

50:19.033 --> 50:23.277
I'm asking, no? -Not Shivani,
Vishwajith ridiculed Adhi only.

50:23.467 --> 50:26.243
Adhi has got no complaint who
was ridiculed, what is it to her?

50:26.434 --> 50:29.438
Now did you understand? Without
any reason he hitted on my son.

50:29.600 --> 50:33.241
Don't talk in between. What
did he say and mock at you?

50:36.167 --> 50:38.147
Spoke unwanted things
about Adhi's papa.

50:38.267 --> 50:40.975
When I tried to stop that
he twisted my hand.

50:41.300 --> 50:43.246
Told him to leave three times.

50:43.367 --> 50:47.144
Then he twisted more. I had struck
him when the pain was un bearable.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.775
Lie, what she says is a big lie.

50:50.067 --> 50:52.069
Hey didn't I say not to
talk in between? - You!

50:53.634 --> 50:57.241
This is the girl, when a person puts
the hand unnecessarily on her body...

50:57.334 --> 51:00.247
...she'll beat. She should beat.
Like this.

51:00.633 --> 51:02.579
That is the same this
girl has also done.

51:02.700 --> 51:03.770
But she showed a decency...

51:04.433 --> 51:06.071
...before beating she had
told to take off the hand.

51:06.234 --> 51:10.546
Not once, three times is it doctor
who doesn't show that decency?

51:10.700 --> 51:12.646
Teaching decency for this child?

51:14.100 --> 51:17.172
That's all. There is nothing wrong
in what Shivani has done.

51:18.634 --> 51:20.705
Should behave with
girls with respect.

51:29.267 --> 51:31.543
Don't think everything is
over with this.

51:32.400 --> 51:35.711
You and your mummy I'll make
both to suffer for this.

51:43.267 --> 51:46.476
Rocked! Should be like
this to whoever it is.

51:46.634 --> 51:49.513
If he does any mischiefs
hit on his nose.

51:50.200 --> 51:53.044
If Shivani was born as my daughter,
it would have been beautiful.

51:53.134 --> 51:54.238
Shall I go?

51:56.767 --> 52:01.580
She is a girl if you say and go
as if she has done a big thing.

52:01.734 --> 52:03.407
I'm the one to suffer.

52:03.533 --> 52:05.342
When children does mistakes
should correct, that is needed.

52:05.500 --> 52:07.571
Not simply encouraging the roguery.

52:11.600 --> 52:13.341
Come here.

52:15.467 --> 52:18.744
Why is she always scolding at me?
Other day when I phoned.

52:19.100 --> 52:20.977
Scolded me saying that
I don't have manners.

52:21.067 --> 52:23.673
I broke that phone there itself.
Look again the same now.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.106
I told her side only
boy, scolding for that also.

52:27.233 --> 52:32.307
What is this boy? -True what
Shivani's mummy told is not fair at all.

52:33.067 --> 52:35.274
Should have told some more.
What?

52:37.567 --> 52:40.241
If I've done mistake mother
should scold me, no?

52:40.400 --> 52:42.505
Mummy why did you
scold Adhi's papa?

52:42.667 --> 52:45.443
Adhi's papa only proved that
there is justice on my side.

52:45.600 --> 52:48.240
Yes proved that he is
also a dirty one like you.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.743
Shivani you are a girl, no? Hitting
on that boy's nose what have you done?

52:54.000 --> 52:55.104
In between that he also interfered.

52:55.300 --> 52:57.337
Now simply Malini became
our foe is it not?

52:57.400 --> 52:59.437
For that why should
mummy fear them?

52:59.633 --> 53:01.704
I'm not scared of them
I'm scared of you only.

53:04.467 --> 53:06.447
Earlier I had the same
character of yours.

53:06.600 --> 53:09.046
I never used to
tolerate a small thing.

53:09.134 --> 53:10.772
I used to react any
where and to anybody.

53:11.067 --> 53:12.478
Do you know that?

53:12.767 --> 53:17.079
Because of that bad character
of mine we lost your papa.

53:17.767 --> 53:19.576
In a shopping complex at Pune.

53:19.767 --> 53:22.771
Had gone for shopping
along with your daddy.

53:25.767 --> 53:27.405
What are you doing?

53:29.134 --> 53:30.238
Leave him.

53:30.700 --> 53:33.271
Leave.
Just listen to what I'm saying.

53:33.434 --> 53:36.040
I'll give him what he wants from me.

53:43.234 --> 53:46.181
Hima leave them. They aren't
the people whom we can deal.

53:46.367 --> 53:47.744
Leave.
Listen to what I say.

54:03.500 --> 54:06.413
Sanjai how can you
find all this so silly?

54:08.100 --> 54:11.479
When I removed that jerks hand,
Sanju could have reacted, no?

54:11.634 --> 54:13.705
At that time itself he will
get scared and leave, no?

54:13.800 --> 54:16.440
That filthy worm was
coming after and harassing.

54:17.400 --> 54:20.643
How bold was that contemptible
fellow? That too publicly.

54:21.167 --> 54:24.011
And still...Hell with it!

54:25.700 --> 54:29.307
A girls biggest confidence
is the male who is with her.

54:31.667 --> 54:34.705
I lost all the confidence
on Sanjai today.

57:07.567 --> 57:09.308
Sanjai what did you do?

57:10.167 --> 57:15.241
Since I told something in that anger.
Why did you go and fight with them?

58:10.667 --> 58:14.581
You are doing the same
mistake that I did on that day.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.243
That is why I'm saying
you please cool down.

58:22.300 --> 58:25.747
I don't have the strength
to face one more disaster.

Sir sister has come.
Tell to come.

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.738
Just wait outside for a minute.
Okay sir. - Come mam.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.111
Other day I've told
about that Hima isn't it?

01:02:54.267 --> 01:02:56.213
Regarding her daughter
slapped on my son.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.710
At that time I've decided
she must be taught a lesson.

01:02:58.767 --> 01:03:00.542
Look all this is for that.

01:03:01.233 --> 01:03:03.372
Collected from Mum bai.

01:03:04.233 --> 01:03:08.272
Hima studied at the Symbiosis at
Pune. This is her husband.

01:03:08.434 --> 01:03:10.141
During a street fight that
took place at that time...

01:03:10.267 --> 01:03:12.269
...he was killed and he is a Malayali.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.573
Its said that the reason
for that is Him a.

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:17.579
She had vanished from there at
that time, you should find the where...

01:03:17.734 --> 01:03:20.146
...about of her husband's family.

01:03:20.267 --> 01:03:21.746
On using your police source.

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:27.310
Take this and go.
My job is not all this.

01:03:27.434 --> 01:03:29.436
From long time ago
you had this mental disease.

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:32.078
On feeling the enmity, your
decision to finish them.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.780
Again I can't support your madness.

01:03:35.134 --> 01:03:40.083
You don't help me daddy's friends
and disciples lot of them are in police.

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.441
I'll go and meet them.
No need.

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.638
No need to disturb those people
give that one. I'll look into it.

01:03:51.367 --> 01:03:53.643
Saritha, keep that in the shelf.

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.213
Where are the kids?
On top in the computer room.

01:04:01.267 --> 01:04:03.406
Is this your dad?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.278
Do you miss daddy? -Before
I was born daddy died isn't it?

01:04:11.433 --> 01:04:16.041
Then how can I miss him? -But
still will anyone dislike own dad?

01:04:17.434 --> 01:04:21.405
You don't like your papa, no?
I like papa and all.

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.706
What I don't like is
creating this fight always.

01:04:25.067 --> 01:04:28.048
If that case give it to
me I'll take care of your papa.

01:04:29.434 --> 01:04:31.243
Don't stare, I asked truly.

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.369
In exchange can you
give your mummy to me?

01:04:34.434 --> 01:04:37.176
Then why not make your
papa marry my mummy?

01:04:38.134 --> 01:04:40.614
Then you'll get mummy
and I'll get papa also.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:46.440
Better than that drown
your mummy in any well!

01:04:46.767 --> 01:04:49.509
Don't go man.
Shivani!

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.407
Mummy is coming.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.303
Adhi being with you why
is she not becoming good?

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:07.277
For that am I bad?
Not bad at all.

01:05:07.434 --> 01:05:10.244
Isn't it Adhi? She has told
that Adhi likes white chocolate.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.075
Eat this and see.

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:22.515
Poor one. How can you think to
marry this mummy to my father?

01:05:22.767 --> 01:05:25.577
What's wrong in that man?
You just think.

01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:29.375
The most sweetest m um my
the most powerful papa.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.743
Then you and me as siblings.
What a happy family we'll be?

01:05:33.067 --> 01:05:36.412
With that all the happiness of
your mummy will come to an end!

01:05:36.734 --> 01:05:38.577
Even othenlvise what
happiness for mummy?

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:41.738
When each and every
stupid one says and acts.

01:05:42.034 --> 01:05:44.378
Since we are not having anyone
to ask, that's why isn't it?

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.743
Please man I told seriously.
I also told seriously only.

01:05:48.067 --> 01:05:50.604
For your mummy my
papa will be never a match.

01:05:55.567 --> 01:05:57.979
Before ending the
talk, the person has come.

01:06:00.134 --> 01:06:02.580
Delete everything what
we've discussed now.

01:06:04.334 --> 01:06:07.178
Mummy - Yea keep it there.
LookAdhi is going.

01:06:08.434 --> 01:06:11.415
Adhi's papa has come.
Adhi is about to leave.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.979
Adhi bye.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:16.704
Adhi's papa has come.
What should I do for that?

01:06:17.067 --> 01:06:18.705
Should I stand with
my head down?

01:06:21.734 --> 01:06:23.213
What is she?

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:27.748
Papa, you are coming for first
time, no? Come inside and leave.

01:06:32.067 --> 01:06:34.707
Papa no need, no time
we should go to a place.

01:06:35.034 --> 01:06:36.445
Where?
Shopping.

01:06:36.634 --> 01:06:38.409
Just drop in and we'll
go for a shopping is it?

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.571
It won't be okay on going.
Hey boy five minutes will do.

01:06:40.667 --> 01:06:43.079
Papa are you coming
or not? You get inside.

01:06:48.433 --> 01:06:50.709
So I'll come some other day.
Okay papa.

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:07.740
My papa this why saying
papa doesn't have brains.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.002
Is it Shivani who
should call papa to house?

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.080
Its Shivani's mummy, is it?
On knowing papa has come...

01:07:12.267 --> 01:07:14.406
...didn't come out to say hi.

01:07:14.634 --> 01:07:16.705
Then why is that papa
making a visit without respect?

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.713
I didn't notice that one.
This is my problem.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.215
Certain things I won't understand.
You should make me understand all this.

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.779
Othenlvise today I would
have been a fool.

01:07:32.334 --> 01:07:35.406
Why aren't you sleeping?
Mummy not feeling sleepy.

01:07:38.134 --> 01:07:40.546
Try to go and sleep.

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:07.406
Hello. - Hey man have you
thought over it? - What?

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.602
Regarding my mummy's
and your papa's matter.

01:08:09.767 --> 01:08:12.577
There is nothing to think on seeing
your mummy's today's reaction.

01:08:12.734 --> 01:08:14.372
Didn't you understand that?

01:08:14.467 --> 01:08:17.778
Neither in life my papa will not be
allowed in that area by mummy.

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:22.606
You go man, now I'm going to send
a photo message from mummy's phone.

01:08:22.767 --> 01:08:24.075
To your Papa-

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:26.509
Shivani don't do unwanted
things, that will be a problem.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.241
I've already sent you go
and check papa's reaction.

01:08:31.134 --> 01:08:35.412
What reaction? Before papa sees
that I'm going to delete that one.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.375
You also delete that
from mummy's phone.

01:08:37.533 --> 01:08:39.673
All that I'll do you go and check.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.706
Where are you going after
putting all this on my head?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.776
My stomach is upset.
Why is that one upset all of a sudden?

01:09:12.134 --> 01:09:13.703
Why is that won't I've loose motion?

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.474
Why don't I've freedom to have
loose motion in this house?

01:09:16.634 --> 01:09:18.375
That is good.

01:09:28.267 --> 01:09:29.712
Ruined it!

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:35.267
MBRHDRG

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:47.702
Shivani!
My god!

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:52.706
What is it mummy?
What happened?

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:55.307
Didn't I say he is cheap?
Look at this.

01:09:55.467 --> 01:09:58.243
What is this? - Message sent
by him. Saying I'm good.

01:09:58.367 --> 01:10:00.506
What is it to me?
If he is good or bad.

01:10:01.067 --> 01:10:05.243
A cheap person how
handsome is papa.

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:08.610
On seeing this did mummy yell out?
Papa? Is he your papa?

01:10:08.767 --> 01:10:10.610
Then what about
Adhi calling mummy?

01:10:10.667 --> 01:10:12.704
Is he like him? How sweet he is.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:16.013
This person is cheap his job is to
send messages at night to girls.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:18.205
My mummy papa might have
sent this to someone else.

01:10:18.334 --> 01:10:21.076
To whom? Its sent to me only.
Okay then good give it here.

01:10:21.267 --> 01:10:23.679
On deleting it will end, no? Here.

01:10:26.001 --> 01:10:28.277
Again if he sends message
I'll complaint to cyber cell.

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:32.071
God, from where did I
get a mummy like this?

01:10:33.567 --> 01:10:37.071
Shivani, papa has send
a reply with photo.

01:10:37.134 --> 01:10:39.671
Before mummy sees that
at least delete that please.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.474
Mummy opened that and
finished the shouting on that.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:48.141
Saw? Didn't I say whatever you
do your mummy won't like my papa.

01:10:48.267 --> 01:10:51.441
You are that papa's son, is it?
Mummy likes you very much.

01:10:51.601 --> 01:10:56.744
Why not liking papa? -That is my
papa loves you more than me, no?

01:10:57.167 --> 01:11:00.148
Then shall we plan tomorrow?
What plan?

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.110
Like I spending with
papa and you with mummy.

01:11:03.267 --> 01:11:06.248
How is that possible?
Hey fool I'll come to your music school.

01:11:06.301 --> 01:11:06.335
From there papa will pick me up.

01:11:08.267 --> 01:11:10.269
Like that you should
come to my dance school.

01:11:10.434 --> 01:11:12.141
From there mummy will pick you up.

01:11:29.567 --> 01:11:31.979
Adhi have you joined
dance class also?

01:11:32.134 --> 01:11:35.115
No mummy Shivani had
collected a book from me.

01:11:35.234 --> 01:11:38.772
Came to collect that, then Shivani
went there searching for me.

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.712
She is there in the line.
Adhi you get inside the car.

01:11:42.034 --> 01:11:46.176
Hello, you wait there itself myself
and Ad hi will come over there.

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:49.008
No need mummy papa has
come here to pick up Adhi.

01:11:49.134 --> 01:11:52.411
Papa will drop me. Mummy you

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:57.245

No need, I've to supply chocolates.

01:11:57.367 --> 01:12:00.075
Then has to do some shopping
and all. - Mummy he'll sit in the car.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.680
He really likes to come
with mummy. Okay bye.

01:12:08.434 --> 01:12:11.677
No problem with me can drop me
after finishing all thejobs of mummy.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.143
Umm...Close it.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:17.074
This was our plan.
What is that?

01:12:17.267 --> 01:12:19.406
For me to come with papa.
Not only that.

01:12:19.567 --> 01:12:21.410
Adhi really likes to travel
along with mum my.

01:12:21.601 --> 01:12:23.080
So I fulfilled that.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:28.046
Other day when I created
a fight papa had told is it?

01:12:28.267 --> 01:12:32.044
Papa didn't have a daughter like me
that was simply told to console me, is it?

01:12:32.234 --> 01:12:33.474
No I told that truly.

01:12:34.434 --> 01:12:38.143
Children should be like you on
getting a beat must not cry and come.

01:12:38.334 --> 01:12:40.041
Should return back, two.

01:12:40.167 --> 01:12:45.139
Even if its boy or a girl that is my line.
Papa for such a daring person like you.

01:12:45.267 --> 01:12:47.747
How did you get a cool
headed boy like Adhi?

01:12:50.767 --> 01:12:53.213
My wish was wanted a girl like you.

01:12:53.434 --> 01:12:55.004
For the wife, a son.

01:12:55.134 --> 01:12:59.048
We both prayed to god. God
answered both of our prayers.

01:12:59.467 --> 01:13:05.975
As wife wished got a son. Like my
prayers he had girl's character.

01:15:50.501 --> 01:15:53.710
Mummy didn't you see Adhi's father
outside? When I called he didn't come.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.108
Remained in the car itsef.
Anyway that was good.

01:15:55.234 --> 01:15:58.272
Mummy why can't you call inside?
For what? That's not needed at all.

01:16:01.034 --> 01:16:02.342
Go man!

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.581
Papa, will go. Here!

01:16:09.034 --> 01:16:11.480
My goodness has Ad hi left? - Yes.

Mummy has given this for you.
Thanks.

01:16:33.434 --> 01:16:36.608
What is this? - Chocolates.
Made by her isn't it?

01:16:39.167 --> 01:16:42.410
That girl is innocent. But that
chocolate of your's is there, no?

01:16:42.534 --> 01:16:48.712
She is so egoistic. A real hum bug.
No papa, mummy is also innocent.

01:16:49.034 --> 01:16:52.208
Do you know how much she
loves me? - Who doesn't like you?

01:16:52.567 --> 01:16:55.707
You are really decent,
not like me isn't it?

01:16:56.034 --> 01:16:58.344
I also really likes mummy.

01:16:59.401 --> 01:17:02.143
Other than me you

01:17:02.334 --> 01:17:06.146

special love towards mummy.

"Before ending the talk, joy of sea
breeze is sounding in the ear"

enquired lot of things about papa.

01:17:42.434 --> 01:17:45.278
What to ask? I'm cheap.

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:49.209
A quarrel some guy, making fights,
a hit man. All this things, no?

01:17:49.467 --> 01:17:54.348
Nope! Nothing of that.
It is those things, don't I know?

01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:28.205
Why wasting this one?
Papa I haven't wasted it.

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:31.247
That was kept in fridge isn't it.
On keeping it in fridge it will get cold, no?

01:18:32.234 --> 01:18:34.043
What is it? Is it some
kind of detective novel?

01:18:34.167 --> 01:18:38.013
No, chicken soup.
May be some cookery article.

01:18:38.434 --> 01:18:40.710
Chicken soup is a name of a book.

by Jack Canfield and Victor Hansen

01:18:53.434 --> 01:18:57.075

Hey boy not about the book, asked

That will be there, no?

Yea now I remember, told she
has asked something about me.

What was that?

01:19:08.267 --> 01:19:09.439
While we were coming in the car.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.602
Haven't you told she
asked something about me?

01:19:11.767 --> 01:19:15.271
Yea, yea that's true
what did she ask?

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.744
Are you asking me?
How will I know?

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.472
You think and say when
you remember, okay?

01:19:28.334 --> 01:19:34.580
Have you slept so fast? - Time is
10 o'clock, no? - Its only 9:55, no?

01:19:35.467 --> 01:19:39.540
Papa, what do you want?
Boy did you get that? - What?

01:19:39.734 --> 01:19:41.611
What she told about me!

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:47.372
My heavens with this papa! During
sleep I can't remember anything.

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:49.477
Even othenlvise you
won't remember anything.

01:19:49.767 --> 01:19:52.077
You remember all the
unnecessary things.

01:19:52.267 --> 01:19:55.771
People who writes chicken soup,
mutton soup you remember about them.

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:59.206
If anybody says a good thing about
own papa, doesn't remember that one.

01:20:13.467 --> 01:20:16.676
Hello.
Too bad Shivani! My poor papa!

01:20:17.034 --> 01:20:20.277
He is running to and fro without sleep.
My goodness, really?

01:20:20.434 --> 01:20:21.071
Then what?

01:20:21.334 --> 01:20:24.076
At that time itself haven't I told
mummy won't come in our way?

01:20:24.267 --> 01:20:28.010
Mum my will come, you wait and
see for that I've done some plans.

01:20:28.234 --> 01:20:31.044
For my birth day I'll make the
invitation through mummy.

01:20:31.167 --> 01:20:32.441
You bring papa and come.

01:20:50.267 --> 01:20:53.612
Adhi, still now haven't you
gone for birth day party?

01:20:53.801 --> 01:20:55.576
For that papa must get
ready and come, no?

01:20:56.001 --> 01:20:57.981
What is there for him to get ready?

01:20:58.101 --> 01:21:00.012
Just wear a mundu
(Loin cloth) and a shirt.

01:21:00.201 --> 01:21:03.080
Yea, for that for a long time he
has gone inside and locked up.

01:21:03.267 --> 01:21:06.043
Then he must be
sleeping, hey man Bhaskar.

01:21:06.267 --> 01:21:08.076
Aren't you going for that
child's birth day?

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.511
Can't you see he is
waiting here dressed up? -Yea coming.

01:21:23.301 --> 01:21:26.248
Holy cow! Papa what is this?

01:21:27.101 --> 01:21:28.637
Why? Isn't it good?

01:21:29.334 --> 01:21:32.406
Is this dress worn during meetings
while going with grandpa to Bombay?

01:21:32.534 --> 01:21:34.275
Why did you wear this now?

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:37.106
Boy while going for a party
must dress decently, no?

01:21:37.267 --> 01:21:39.474
My papa for the party
there are only 4 people.

01:21:39.634 --> 01:21:41.511
Me, papa, Shivani and mummy.

01:21:41.601 --> 01:21:44.047
That is enough, any way
its a birth day party, no?

01:21:44.201 --> 01:21:47.341
This is my party dress, okay.
Okay. Then one more thing.

01:21:47.467 --> 01:21:50.141
While wearing this dress and going
grandpa used to say one thing, no?

01:21:50.267 --> 01:21:53.305
Should not talk at the meeting. Like
that on coming there, shouldn't talk.

01:21:53.467 --> 01:21:56.141
Boy as for me talking is
less, there is only full of action.

01:21:56.367 --> 01:21:59.439
Look how is this?

01:22:00.534 --> 01:22:02.241
Not good there is another one.

01:22:04.367 --> 01:22:05.345
What about this one?

01:22:10.201 --> 01:22:13.273
This one is super, no?
My papa even this dress is over.

01:22:13.434 --> 01:22:16.176
If its compulsory hang
one in the pocket.

01:22:19.767 --> 01:22:22.338
Why not hang this
behind the collar like this?

01:22:23.334 --> 01:22:25.075
My goodness will ruin this.

01:22:25.267 --> 01:22:29.306
When your Salman Khan does its
top when I do its cheap. Come, lets go.

01:22:29.434 --> 01:22:31.107
The problem is when
I wear cooling glass.

01:22:40.134 --> 01:22:42.705
Adhi and papa has come
go and open the door.

01:22:43.067 --> 01:22:46.310
You go and open. -I'm not yet
ready. Go and open the door mummy.

01:22:53.734 --> 01:22:55.372
Look papa also has come.

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:03.371
Call, call papa.

01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:07.974
Papa won't come if
m um my doesn't call.

01:23:12.434 --> 01:23:16.143
Papa, look mummy is calling.

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:19.472
Come.

01:23:24.434 --> 01:23:28.041
Can't you get ready early?
What's wrong with m um my?

01:23:32.567 --> 01:23:34.410
Papa should always dress like this.

01:23:42.167 --> 01:23:44.306
How is our house? Is it nice?

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.744
On that day papa has asked
of our chocolate factory, no?

01:23:48.067 --> 01:23:49.239
Everything is in this house.

01:23:49.434 --> 01:23:52.472
MD, production, marketing
everything is one person.

01:23:53.467 --> 01:23:54.309
Papa sit.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.543
Why is papa not talking anything?

01:23:59.634 --> 01:24:02.774
Papa is like this when wearing this
dress, papa won't talk much.

01:24:05.334 --> 01:24:08.281
Then the old dress would have
been enough, I like that papa only.

01:24:08.434 --> 01:24:11.381
Papa what do you like
to have? Mummy is a super cook.

01:24:13.101 --> 01:24:15.411
Shivani. -What is it mummy?
Just come here.

01:24:15.734 --> 01:24:17.077
One minute okay.

01:24:22.701 --> 01:24:25.443
Here, juice is ready. -Mummy why
can't you bring the juice, there?

01:24:25.667 --> 01:24:27.738
Why? Has he come to see
me as a bride to be?

01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:31.445
Mummy! - Shivani why are you
saying unwanted things?

01:24:31.567 --> 01:24:34.411
Did anyone ask about my
cooking and chocolate factory?

01:24:34.567 --> 01:24:37.377
Its to Adhi's papa, no? Poor one.
Poor one.

01:24:37.534 --> 01:24:40.413
His way of sitting, the dress and
the kind of stare, I don't like at all.

01:24:40.567 --> 01:24:43.275
You go and give the
juice, I'll ready the cake.

01:24:43.467 --> 01:24:47.040
Cut it fast and try to sent them off
its a sort of suffocation for me.

01:24:47.134 --> 01:24:50.308
What to send them off? Mummy
had promised we all will go out.

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:52.241
Its like that only.

01:24:55.501 --> 01:24:59.108
Sorry papa, papa is not lucky today
to taste mummy's cooking.

01:24:59.267 --> 01:25:01.440
Our lunch and dinner
everything is from outside.

01:25:01.634 --> 01:25:05.275
Today I'm full free... - No papa
has got no time at all today.

01:25:06.001 --> 01:25:07.742
Yea, I'm not full free today.

01:25:08.067 --> 01:25:10.274
He has promised me
will come with papa.

01:25:10.434 --> 01:25:14.109
Lunch is okay but after dinner
I and papa has to go for a movie.

01:25:14.301 --> 01:25:15.439
Isn't it Papa?

01:25:16.434 --> 01:25:18.971
For movie? Can we also
come, I and mummy.

01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:21.046
No, papa won't like all that.

01:25:22.334 --> 01:25:24.245
Okay let them come.

01:25:26.067 --> 01:25:27.637
ShivaniAdhi come.

01:25:28.967 --> 01:25:33.967
MC Movie Channel

01:25:48.767 --> 01:25:51.077
Who is that?
Have you called anyone else?

01:25:51.234 --> 01:25:53.077
No. Has mummy
called anyone else?

01:25:53.234 --> 01:25:55.646
For me whom to call.
Just go and see.

01:26:53.567 --> 01:26:55.604
Hima is my wife.

01:27:13.534 --> 01:27:15.571
Happy birthday daughter.

01:27:34.001 --> 01:27:40.976
MBRHDRG

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:43.973
On that day as I was
shot on that street...

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:50.175
...you and my anxiety about
you brought me back to life.

01:27:51.734 --> 01:27:56.046
My dad and mom and all
told, you can't be found out.

01:27:59.767 --> 01:28:02.043
That I'll get you back.

01:28:08.601 --> 01:28:11.081
I reached here correctly.

01:28:11.401 --> 01:28:13.005
Thanks a lot.

01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:17.171
Yea near me. I'll give.

01:28:17.767 --> 01:28:20.771
A friend of Hima, wants to say hello.

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:29.574
Hello. This is my birthday
gift for your daughter.

01:28:30.034 --> 01:28:32.981
As you always feared
your haunting past.

01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:38.238
I can't do any more
revenge than this.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.710
When this friend informed
all the details about you.

01:28:51.367 --> 01:28:55.577
Daddy and mummy were
all ready to come with me.

01:28:56.434 --> 01:29:00.177
Next time when I come they
will be also there, along with me.

01:29:00.434 --> 01:29:04.211
On seeing them, you will
change your present mind set.

01:29:05.101 --> 01:29:08.105
I'm sure you'll come with us.

01:29:40.801 --> 01:29:42.781
Hello.
Hello, Hima what's happening?

01:29:43.134 --> 01:29:44.238
Manitha, where are you?

01:29:45.367 --> 01:29:47.711
You be bold.
Okay you come fast.

01:29:52.434 --> 01:29:54.209
Hima, what's happening?
In the ICU.

01:29:56.101 --> 01:29:58.445
You pay the money
first rest I'll manage.

01:30:17.334 --> 01:30:20.076
Can't get inside IC ambulance
come. We'll go in car.

01:30:23.601 --> 01:30:26.081
Manitha, just drive fast please.

01:30:26.267 --> 01:30:28.247
You don't get tensed relax.

01:30:53.234 --> 01:30:55.236
Told its craft hospital isn't it?
Yes.

01:30:55.634 --> 01:30:57.580
Then, where else to take?

01:30:58.401 --> 01:30:59.709
Come.

01:31:11.267 --> 01:31:14.339
How long do you know
this Sanjai Sharma?

01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:19.376
I know for the last one year, I came
here to do the PG at Symbiosis.

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:22.706
Met like that.
From then on where you together'?

01:31:26.334 --> 01:31:28.541
But the marriage was fixed.

01:31:28.734 --> 01:31:32.511
For that while planning to go to
Sanjai's parents at Bangalore.

01:31:32.667 --> 01:31:35.307
This accident took place.
Then what about Hima's parents?

01:31:37.267 --> 01:31:41.579
Because of the relationship with
Sanjai they left me and went.

01:31:43.234 --> 01:31:45.236
Now settled in Canada.

01:31:49.667 --> 01:31:53.137
Again in this place I've only Sanjai.

01:31:54.234 --> 01:31:57.340
This Sanjai is not a
person what you think.

01:32:09.767 --> 01:32:13.237
As a part of a mission
he came to this native.

01:32:13.667 --> 01:32:16.648
Three months back one of your friend's
marriage took place, isn't it?

01:32:17.167 --> 01:32:20.148
Daughter of a diamond merchant
named Eknath Chathurvedhi.

01:32:20.267 --> 01:32:24.545
Yes. - On that wedding day itself
Chathurvedhi was shot dead.

01:32:25.667 --> 01:32:27.704
That was done by Sanjai.

01:32:31.134 --> 01:32:33.136
Just because he was
the boy friend of Hima...

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:36.244
...on that day he could enter
that wedding function.

01:32:36.434 --> 01:32:39.244
Only for that purpose
he became close with Him a.

01:32:42.567 --> 01:32:45.480
Now I want to ask
certain things alone to Hima.

01:32:57.467 --> 01:32:59.276
Usually these people
after completing the task...

01:32:59.434 --> 01:33:01.277
...they won't stay in that
native for a second.

01:33:02.234 --> 01:33:05.238
That is why we didn't doubt
Sanjai in the beginning.

01:33:05.434 --> 01:33:09.678
Sanjai broke the routine may be
due to real love towards Hima.

01:33:10.267 --> 01:33:14.272
May be because of that people who
delegated him had a dislike on him.

01:33:14.701 --> 01:33:19.616
They might have attempted to kill
Sanjai. Or the opposite gang.

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:24.044
May be someone among them
might have taken from hospital.

01:33:24.301 --> 01:33:27.441
Hima is our strongest
witness in this case.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:33.983
But as you are a very innocent girl.
Coming to understand you were trapped.

01:33:34.234 --> 01:33:39.650
That is why I'm helping you.
And all the more, I being a Malayali.

01:33:40.767 --> 01:33:43.976
Whether Sanjai lives or dies
that is dangerous for Hima

01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:47.604
They will come searching for Hima
so again don't stay in this native.

01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:51.479
Disdain all the contacts in here
and leave this place and go.

01:33:51.667 --> 01:33:53.647
Should never come back.

01:33:55.200 --> 01:34:00.548
Your departure and where you are
going even this friend shouldn't know.

01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:06.372
Because no one should
be able to trace Hima.

01:34:10.234 --> 01:34:12.771
No idea what all things
are going to happen.

01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:17.207
I don't know what to do next?
Why not call Adhi's papa and tell?

01:34:17.401 --> 01:34:19.745
Enough! You and your Adhi's papa.

01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:22.580
That person only
simply insulted Dr. Malini.

01:34:22.634 --> 01:34:24.136
And complicated the
situation to this stage.

01:34:24.267 --> 01:34:25.678
Aren't you done with it?

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:35.712
Careful.

01:34:38.601 --> 01:34:42.208
Eating chocolate?
He and his chocolate!

01:34:42.401 --> 01:34:44.506
Never again bring this thing into
the house, did you understand?

01:34:44.767 --> 01:34:46.474
Come fellow upstairs.

01:34:51.367 --> 01:34:55.543
To drink like this what is
his pain in his mind?

01:34:55.634 --> 01:34:57.204
What mental pain for me?

01:34:57.301 --> 01:34:59.474
On seeing little English
and white complexion.

01:34:59.667 --> 01:35:02.079
Did she think Bhaskar will
get enticed? Insolent lady!

01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:05.713
No doubt her dead husband came
back should happen like that to her.

01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:12.642
Let him return, live together,
die together whatever it may be.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.742
What is it to me? I felt like
drinking I drank, that's all.

01:35:16.101 --> 01:35:17.444
I'll again drink.

01:35:17.734 --> 01:35:21.147
If anyone says anything
about my mental pain.

01:35:21.334 --> 01:35:24.213
Look.
Adhi, you go to other side.

01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:27.247
Adhi you wait there boy. He
should know some more things.

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:33.505
My father told straight on
my face that you are ashamed...

01:35:33.601 --> 01:35:35.171
...to say that I'm your father.

01:35:35.334 --> 01:35:39.544
But you are a pride for me.
Have you felt your mother's love?

01:35:39.634 --> 01:35:44.014
I have felt not even one percentage
of that I had given back to her.

01:35:44.101 --> 01:35:47.708
Even then she loved me. Doctors had
told that she shouldn't bear children.

01:35:48.101 --> 01:35:50.138
She hid that because
of love towards me.

01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:53.645
She had left by giving her life to you.
That love which I couldn't give to her.

01:35:54.067 --> 01:35:56.570
I'll not give to anyone else. He has
got the absolute right for that.

01:35:57.101 --> 01:35:59.411
If he is ashamed to call
me father, don't call.

01:35:59.567 --> 01:36:02.548
Because of that it doesn't
mean that he is not my son.

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:11.737
All these years.

01:36:12.001 --> 01:36:14.504
For not searching you and the child
what is the reason that he says?

01:36:14.801 --> 01:36:17.372
Is it because you left from
there and lived here under cover?

01:36:17.467 --> 01:36:20.243
No. - Then?
He was in jail.

01:36:20.467 --> 01:36:24.540
By forgetting his past
trying to be a new person.

01:36:24.667 --> 01:36:26.169
All that is not my botheration.

01:36:26.267 --> 01:36:29.510
For me and my child we want
a legal protection from him.

01:36:29.767 --> 01:36:33.044
For that legally he is not your
husband nor you are his wife.

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.111
When you say no, its no.

01:36:37.267 --> 01:36:40.441
Then his only claim is
Shivani is his daughter.

01:36:40.567 --> 01:36:43.070
For that let him go for a
case that we'll see at that time.

01:36:43.201 --> 01:36:44.373
Isn't it daughter?

01:36:51.434 --> 01:36:56.076
Its Sanjay's call since morning do
you know how many times he called?

01:36:56.201 --> 01:36:58.147
Why are you cutting
it? Attend the call.

01:36:58.267 --> 01:37:02.181
Whatever he says, just say not possible,
not possible keep on telling it.

01:37:03.767 --> 01:37:06.407
Its him no? Take it
and say not possible.

01:37:10.001 --> 01:37:14.211
Hello.
Thanks ma. One second.

01:37:17.234 --> 01:37:19.407
Hima, I'm Sanjay's mum my.

01:37:26.634 --> 01:37:28.773
Hima Sanjay's father.

01:37:37.334 --> 01:37:38.608
What a torture is this?

01:37:38.734 --> 01:37:40.645
Everyone keeps on calling
like this one after another.

01:37:41.467 --> 01:37:47.008
This is an emotional black mailing,
you being single they can easily access.

01:37:47.534 --> 01:37:49.138
To end that.

01:37:52.467 --> 01:37:57.177
After getting married they can't
access you or can torture you by calling.

01:37:57.367 --> 01:38:02.214
All that is not needed, who will come
to my life? On knowing all these issues.

01:38:02.301 --> 01:38:05.248
What if there is
one person to come?

01:38:05.334 --> 01:38:06.142
Who?

01:38:09.234 --> 01:38:12.306
All my issues who is going
to take all that burdens?

01:38:12.434 --> 01:38:15.005
What if, that person is
ready to take all that burdens?

01:38:15.167 --> 01:38:18.080
Will you keep quite?
Aunty there is a person like that.

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:21.545
Adhi's papa, likes mummy and
knows mummy's issues also.

01:38:22.367 --> 01:38:26.247
Isn't that, owner Bhaskal'? If he is
the guy you don't have to fear anything.

01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:29.280
He'll manage all the issues.
What is it Rasiya?

01:38:29.401 --> 01:38:32.439
One owner Bhaskar!
Mummy, what's wrong with papa?

01:38:32.634 --> 01:38:36.480
Will you sit there?
Talking big things in small mouth.

01:38:37.234 --> 01:38:40.181
Not that there is a logic
in what she says. That person...

01:38:40.367 --> 01:38:43.780
Don't I have enough problems now?
Again should I've issues created by him?

01:38:50.701 --> 01:38:53.580
<i>What is it mummy?
Adm and grandpa has came.</i>

01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:00.671
Don't think exploiting
present situation of Hima.

01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:04.080
Don't think offering a help.

01:39:04.401 --> 01:39:10.044
In this marriage proposal also think
there is my desire and selfishness.

01:39:10.401 --> 01:39:14.543
Along with my son I
wished to see a girl like you.

01:39:15.134 --> 01:39:18.741
For that a circumstance
came and told that.

01:39:22.434 --> 01:39:29.511
No uncle, to marry a person to live
with him. I can't think all those matters.

01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:36.582
My daughter, her future only
that's there in front of me.

01:39:37.701 --> 01:39:43.379
If this child's future concerns you,
isn't this biggest thing you doing for her?

01:39:43.567 --> 01:39:47.674
For Bhaskar he likes this child
very much, she also likes him.

01:39:47.767 --> 01:39:51.579
I know that uncle but still
that won't work out.

01:39:52.034 --> 01:39:57.245
Okay, no father can understand the
faults and Iackings of children.

01:39:57.667 --> 01:40:01.513
He is only tenth standard, culture
less guy carrying on as a rouge.

01:40:01.667 --> 01:40:06.116
I didn't have the common sense to
think he won't be a match for you.

01:40:07.567 --> 01:40:10.605
My goodness, uncle
don't say like that.

01:40:11.134 --> 01:40:13.774
Not because of this
reason why I'm saying no.

01:40:14.034 --> 01:40:17.572
Again I don't have a
marriage don't compel, please.

01:40:17.801 --> 01:40:21.112
Again I won't compel shall we go?

01:40:45.334 --> 01:40:48.247
I only compelled
grandpa and brought him.

01:40:48.601 --> 01:40:53.141
Papa hasn't known all this, I did
because of love towards mummy.

01:40:53.467 --> 01:40:57.142
I didn't know that, it
will hurt mummy this much.

01:40:58.167 --> 01:41:03.167
MC Movie Channel

01:41:16.267 --> 01:41:19.612
Hey man, mummy agreed.
Mummy has agreed to wed papa.

01:41:21.134 --> 01:41:23.011
Come will go and tell grandpa.

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:25.744
Who is she to tell, she is
ready to wed me?

01:41:26.167 --> 01:41:28.408
Father must ask am
I ready to wed her?

01:41:28.534 --> 01:41:30.673
Now asking you
are you ready?

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:31.671
I'm not ready!

01:41:32.034 --> 01:41:33.604
Did I say to propose her?

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.174
Did you tell me to find a girl?
And conduct your marriage.

01:41:37.367 --> 01:41:40.007
Its also like that!
Don't say this is also like that.

01:41:40.101 --> 01:41:41.444
She is a hum bug lady!

01:41:41.667 --> 01:41:44.409
Looking good doesn't work.
But character should be good.

01:41:46.567 --> 01:41:50.037
Then you are also not that decent!
You leave me, I'm a rouge!

01:41:52.667 --> 01:41:55.671
So this was a conspiracy
with everyone, is it?

01:41:56.034 --> 01:41:59.243
If its like that we can do one
thing we can cancel this proposal.

01:41:59.334 --> 01:42:00.312
That's better.

01:42:00.467 --> 01:42:03.073
Don't cancel all of a
sudden let me think!

01:42:03.167 --> 01:42:06.239
What is there to think more?
You said you don't like her, is it?

01:42:06.334 --> 01:42:10.305
Without speaking a word to her how
can we say whether likes or not?

01:42:10.501 --> 01:42:12.742
So, let me speak to her.

01:42:13.101 --> 01:42:15.274
Then I'll decide whether
I should wed her or not.

01:42:17.734 --> 01:42:20.237
Hey man Adhi its too problematic.

01:42:20.368 --> 01:42:22.974
Yea grandpa, papa is
just showing off.

01:42:23.201 --> 01:42:25.408
Now it seems papa has
to come and talk, why?

01:42:25.667 --> 01:42:27.408
Man, what papa says is also right.

01:42:27.567 --> 01:42:31.242
Did mummy behave properly till
now? Let them speak together.

01:42:31.401 --> 01:42:33.108
And after that it will get doomed.

01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:34.677
After marriage let
them speak lifelong.

01:42:35.334 --> 01:42:40.306
Grandpa, he'll speak like this. I'll
bring mummy and let her speak to papa.

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:45.409
Hey Thilak (Chandakkuri)! Good morning.

01:42:47.668 --> 01:42:49.204
Madam have you taken
the dress and all?

01:42:49.534 --> 01:42:52.140
Is this shop belongs to
Mr. Bhaskar? - Yes.

01:42:52.267 --> 01:42:54.713
If boss doesn't get tensed,
I'll tell one thing. - Yea tell me.

01:42:54.801 --> 01:42:58.078
Our Abdul Razaq is going for
wrestling competition and all.

01:42:58.234 --> 01:43:00.771
By sitting idle his body
is getting rusty.

01:43:01.134 --> 01:43:06.550
By morning if he doesn't whack
anyone, his hands will shiver!

01:43:06.734 --> 01:43:09.271
Will we have to take
him for some retreat? Why?

01:43:09.434 --> 01:43:12.608
Usually alcoholics are
saved by taking for a retreat.

01:43:12.767 --> 01:43:14.110
Shall we try that?

01:43:14.234 --> 01:43:16.771
Vikraman, when I'm decent
you should be also decent.

01:43:17.101 --> 01:43:20.742
We don't create fights.
Boss, we are boozing to stop fights.

01:43:21.067 --> 01:43:23.411
We don't create fights and
solve an issue we became decent.

01:43:23.501 --> 01:43:26.710
Look, no will say we are
decent all will say we are timid.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.142
If anyone calls me timid, I'll pardon if
anyone calls boss timid I'll whack him!

01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:33.507
Which means boss whacks
and the rest we'll do it.

01:43:35.367 --> 01:43:39.281
Hello. - To meet boss.
Came, no? Bring upstairs.

01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:40.435
Okay boss.

01:43:41.001 --> 01:43:42.537
Hey fellow, one guest
is coming. - Okay.

01:43:43.267 --> 01:43:46.077
For some time, don't stay here
with your filthy talks, you may go.

01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:49.080
Then don't let anyone here.
Okay boss.

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:53.047
Hey fellow! I shouldn't go,
is it? Then I'll stay here.

01:43:53.201 --> 01:43:54.737
Fellow keep that suit case here.

01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:57.337
Only I should go out, is it?

01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:05.041
Sir is inside.

01:44:05.434 --> 01:44:09.041
So, she was the guest no?
Then what about her?

01:44:09.501 --> 01:44:12.107
Let the door be closed.

01:44:22.067 --> 01:44:23.740
Nothing was intentional.

01:44:24.067 --> 01:44:25.740
No, I didn't come to say all that.

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:31.076
I often comes here for shopping.
Today only came to know its sir's shop.

01:44:31.234 --> 01:44:32.577
Please sit to drink.

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:35.043
I have got a shoot.

01:44:36.067 --> 01:44:38.013
See you later.
I'll drop.

01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:44.542
Anyway really glad
to meet you again.

01:44:45.034 --> 01:44:47.310
Will meet next time on coming.
Okay thank you.

01:44:47.934 --> 01:44:52.934
MBRHDRG

01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:06.409
Come get in. - Mummy.
Get in I say!

01:45:13.767 --> 01:45:19.217
Didn't get this one nor that one!
There is an old saying like that.

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:23.241
While saying good bye its a
routine to hung, for Bombay people.

01:45:23.334 --> 01:45:29.080
As you don't show decency in
anything when that film star...

01:45:29.134 --> 01:45:31.239
...hugged, where did it come from?

01:45:31.334 --> 01:45:37.148
The things went swayed, I'll
talk over the phone.

01:45:37.301 --> 01:45:41.249
When talking over the
phone will create new issues.

01:45:41.434 --> 01:45:44.745
No need I spoke to her she
has got no issues at all.

01:45:45.001 --> 01:45:47.607
I've done all the arrangements
for register marriage.

01:45:48.001 --> 01:45:51.380
Till that time you control
yourself...You...!

01:45:58.467 --> 01:46:03.075
Owner, owner don't get down now
Hima madam has not reached.

01:46:03.267 --> 01:46:05.372
Hey fool then you should have
called us at that time, no?

01:46:05.601 --> 01:46:07.740
Called at that time but
luckily boss came now only.

01:46:08.034 --> 01:46:09.308
What is he saying?

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:13.175
Hey Razaq you could have called
now we would have come before.

01:46:13.333 --> 01:46:15.404
When? Then it'll be early no?

01:46:15.567 --> 01:46:18.207
What grandpa?
Not grandpa...That time and this time.

01:46:18.301 --> 01:46:21.111
Where is he, Bhaskar? - Owner
is practicing. - What practice?

01:46:21.301 --> 01:46:24.145
Inside one wedding is going
on seeing that and practicing.

01:46:24.301 --> 01:46:26.406
Is he going to make a
livelihood to practice?

01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:29.240
My dear sir if this wedding
doesn't take place soon.

01:46:29.334 --> 01:46:32.406
I and her will be
banged by her family.

01:46:32.667 --> 01:46:36.774
Like that if you have agreed
to marry under his pressure...

01:46:37.101 --> 01:46:41.072
...to refrain do you want
any legal help?

01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:44.738
Sir did you see this? - Sir are
you sitting here to conduct...

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.277
...or to cancel wedding?
Yea coming with complicated questions.

01:46:48.367 --> 01:46:51.314
Man, this is law.
Sir to them must ask like this.

01:46:51.467 --> 01:46:53.640
Sir, laws are to protect
people not to harass.

01:46:54.034 --> 01:46:54.774
Man you sign on it.

01:46:55.267 --> 01:46:57.406
Let the loving ones
live somewhere sir.

01:46:57.567 --> 01:47:01.515
This was snatched from some
where did you see like day and night.

01:47:01.667 --> 01:47:03.374
This color is not my problem sir.

01:47:03.567 --> 01:47:06.104
My mother is like this whatever
she makes she will over cook it.

01:47:06.267 --> 01:47:07.302
Put the garland.

01:47:08.601 --> 01:47:10.478
Not you man, put it on girl.

01:47:12.367 --> 01:47:15.041
Come get the blessings.
Why falling on my leg?

01:47:15.234 --> 01:47:16.212
Go and fall on parents legs.

01:47:16.434 --> 01:47:19.381
Sir you are our guidance. Or else
this sir might have complicated.

01:47:19.567 --> 01:47:20.568
Bow down.

01:47:21.168 --> 01:47:25.116
Mummy Adhi's papa and they
all are waiting there come fast.

01:47:30.767 --> 01:47:34.738
I'm really scared.
You are scared to choose a friend.

01:47:35.101 --> 01:47:37.206
Then if a person comes
to life, won't there be tension?

01:47:37.368 --> 01:47:38.745
Everything will be all right.

01:47:46.601 --> 01:47:49.081
Mother please come.

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:56.508
Father Shivani.

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:08.204
I'll give to grandpa.
Advocate Rasiya aunty.

01:48:09.667 --> 01:48:13.205
Hello.
Sorry Hima can't come today.

01:48:13.367 --> 01:48:16.576
To escape by saying sorry its not
coming eat feast during wedding.

01:48:16.767 --> 01:48:21.716
She is a bride tell to come fast. - No
uncle she is in a situation like that.

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:23.780
That's why.
All that is not okay.

01:48:24.067 --> 01:48:25.205
Advocate you give the
phone to her.

01:48:25.401 --> 01:48:28.314
As she is reluctant to talk
that is why told me to talk.

01:48:28.568 --> 01:48:31.310
Hima told to cancel the marriage.

01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:40.079
What?
She is telling to cancel the marriage.

01:48:40.267 --> 01:48:43.248
What's the matter?
Over there some issue has taken place.

01:48:43.367 --> 01:48:44.368
Is there any issue
bigger than wedding?

01:48:44.534 --> 01:48:47.014
Issues start after the wedding, no?
Get lost you fellows!

01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:48.340
For me it was like that.
Shut up!

01:48:48.501 --> 01:48:51.448
That lawyer lady had called
and said she can't come here.

01:48:51.601 --> 01:48:54.480
What can't come here? If
can't come here we'll go there.

01:48:54.601 --> 01:48:56.274
Then will lift no?
Come, lift.

01:48:56.467 --> 01:48:58.071

Excuse me can you give that
vehicle on rent for some time?

01:50:07.767 --> 01:50:11.010
This is too heavy, on getting
that vehicle there will be a flow.

01:50:11.467 --> 01:50:15.074
What is all this?
Aluva registrar office we shifted to here.

01:50:18.434 --> 01:50:20.141

01:50:36.167 --> 01:50:39.239
What to come out? Boss enter with
the right leg with blessings. - Yes.

01:50:39.534 --> 01:50:41.571
You people don't
roam here, go home...

01:50:41.701 --> 01:50:43.703
...who will check the
things over there? - Okay boss.

01:50:56.101 --> 01:50:58.581
Sanjay's parents have come.

01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:03.112
Greetings I'm banker Shankar
Narayanan. This is my son Bhaskar.

01:51:03.234 --> 01:51:04.304
This is his son Adhi.

01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:08.380
Happy that you all had come to
witness this sacred ceremony.

01:51:08.534 --> 01:51:11.708
What sacred ceremony?
Hima didn't you say this to them?

01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:16.205
Hima's and this Bhaskars register
marriage is going to take place here.

01:51:25.334 --> 01:51:29.510
Her husband is standing
here. My son Sanjay.

01:51:29.701 --> 01:51:32.443
To escape from a
criminal like your son...

01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:33.977
...that's why Hima
agreed for this wedding.

01:51:37.567 --> 01:51:40.514
Including the wheel chair I'll kick
you to abyss, I'll tell you that.

01:51:52.401 --> 01:51:55.075
My daddy became little emotional.

01:52:00.501 --> 01:52:03.414
If Hima doesn't like to
live with me no need.

01:52:04.067 --> 01:52:06.069
Can marry anyone.

01:52:06.434 --> 01:52:08.471
But Shivani...

01:52:10.434 --> 01:52:12.345
She will live with me.

01:52:15.767 --> 01:52:20.238
Again from here when I leave
I'll have her also with me.

01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:23.211
Leave fellow!
You won't do anything.

01:52:23.334 --> 01:52:26.406
You, your handicapped father and
mom won't go from here properly.

01:52:26.567 --> 01:52:29.047
If you touch her I'll kill and burry you.

01:52:29.734 --> 01:52:34.149
Hey mister, if I'm her
father I'll take her.

01:52:34.267 --> 01:52:36.679
After creating and then walking
away, such a person is not father.

01:52:37.034 --> 01:52:38.445
Should call on your father.
Hey you!

01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:43.742
My heavens, father please, please.
Tell to go without creating issues.

01:52:44.101 --> 01:52:46.513
Stop it stop it fellows.

01:52:46.701 --> 01:52:50.080
By fighting and getting your claim
its not your property dealings.

01:52:50.334 --> 01:52:51.574
Come lets go.

01:52:55.101 --> 01:52:56.603
Come on man.

01:52:57.034 --> 01:52:59.446
Make arrangements
to send him back.

01:52:59.801 --> 01:53:02.782
Come.
Take, take. Hold it.

01:53:04.467 --> 01:53:07.539
The day when this
child called me papa...

01:53:07.767 --> 01:53:11.146
...on that day I've decided
she is my daughter.

01:53:11.367 --> 01:53:14.746
Always it will remain like that
even if she has got anyone.

01:53:25.501 --> 01:53:30.280
Without any culture daughter have
you agreed to marry this rascal?

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.004
I don't want that man's character
and culture's certificate from anyone.

01:53:37.534 --> 01:53:41.346
My daughter likes that person
very much and the same to her.

01:53:42.267 --> 01:53:47.979
Even then I'm canceling this
marriage its not for anyone you people.

01:53:55.467 --> 01:54:01.543
Hey Jaggu when boss descends from
the car, fire the crackers correctly.

01:54:04.434 --> 01:54:07.074
So that is it father and son
are you playing drama here?

01:54:07.234 --> 01:54:10.238
We are not father and
son he is from Bihar.

01:54:10.601 --> 01:54:13.582
God even to light a cracker
no Malayali is available...

01:54:13.734 --> 01:54:15.372
...even for that people from Bihar?

01:54:15.534 --> 01:54:20.449
What does sir want? When boss and
wife descends the crackers should fire.

01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:24.405
Now your cheeks must be slapped.

01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:27.137
No man its not 'Bharya' (Wife)
its wife. - Both are same no?

01:54:27.301 --> 01:54:29.406
Never one person is
husband and other is wife.

01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:33.104
Is it so?
This is not cheap wives which you have.

01:54:33.301 --> 01:54:35.781
Well educated and with
English its a madam.

01:54:36.134 --> 01:54:40.549
Did you hear? Not a cheap wife
when boss and wife comes.

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:42.108
You should light the crackers.

01:54:43.067 --> 01:54:45.479
Not father, its boss and wife
these people will ruin this.

01:54:45.634 --> 01:54:48.240
Hey man what about band set?
All that I've given timing to them.

01:54:48.367 --> 01:54:52.338
Is it so? - Did you hear what
I said? What I told is timing.

01:54:52.467 --> 01:54:53.741
When the crackers finishes
the band should be started.

01:54:54.067 --> 01:54:57.173
If there is any change in
that timing I won't pay any money.

01:54:57.300 --> 01:55:00.247
Then what if the crackers loses its
timing? - That question has lost its timing.

01:55:00.434 --> 01:55:01.640
Hey man crackers
are not like you men.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.173
When your bang fails it will break.

01:55:04.334 --> 01:55:06.575
But when the crackers
bursts its success.

01:55:06.767 --> 01:55:09.111
Razaq!
Sir you don't worry.

01:55:09.234 --> 01:55:11.271
The moment the crackers
finishes the band will be started.

01:55:11.434 --> 01:55:13.175
What if the crackers won't finish?
Then the band will not be started.

01:55:15.334 --> 01:55:18.144
Look has come!
Okay stop! Go all of you!

01:55:18.367 --> 01:55:20.540
Hey Bihari the crackers!

01:55:33.467 --> 01:55:35.344
Hey fellows what non sense is this?

01:55:35.534 --> 01:55:38.344
Stop it.
Can't stop boss has ignited the fire.

01:55:38.501 --> 01:55:41.414
Stop it by pouring water. The
marriage is canceled and returns upset.

01:55:41.567 --> 01:55:44.446
Are you fellows celebrating?
God is the wedding canceled?

01:55:44.667 --> 01:55:46.271
The marriage is canceled,
hey fellows stop the crackers!

01:55:46.434 --> 01:55:49.074
Hey fellow somehow tell to stop.
That will end when its finished.

01:55:49.167 --> 01:55:52.444
Say it in Bihari. - For lighting the
crackers why to say it in Bihal'?

01:55:52.667 --> 01:55:55.580
Say it in Bihari language.
Hey has it stopped? -My god!

01:55:55.767 --> 01:55:56.745
Donkeys!

01:56:00.401 --> 01:56:02.244
Stop it!

01:56:02.467 --> 01:56:05.073
Go and tell them to stop.
Go and tell them to stop.

01:56:05.234 --> 01:56:10.616
Stop it.

01:56:10.767 --> 01:56:11.643
What happened?
Is the timing not correct?

01:56:11.801 --> 01:56:14.543
The entire timing is lost. - This is what
I said must check the timing of crackers.

01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:16.204
You don't talk anything
regarding the timing of crackers.

01:56:16.300 --> 01:56:20.009
All should be send from
here immediately, tom fools!

01:56:23.301 --> 01:56:27.579
Boss excuse us, we did for the
happiness of ours. -But got doomed.

01:56:30.434 --> 01:56:31.970
Poor boss.

01:56:35.301 --> 01:56:38.612
What non sense have they
done? Hey you Abdul Razaq.

01:56:39.367 --> 01:56:43.076
Vikarama? - Yea coming in a moment,
everything is problematic man.

01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:46.774
What is it boss? -Remove all
this and clean this immediately.

01:56:48.101 --> 01:56:50.980
God!
Who is this again firing crackers?

01:56:51.134 --> 01:56:53.637
No one boss the crackers
are firing at its own will. - Yes.

01:56:57.234 --> 01:56:58.611
Is this also at its own will?

01:56:58.767 --> 01:57:01.270
That is done by Vikraman.
Simply no need to pay money, no?

01:57:01.367 --> 01:57:04.405
Thought let them work. Why that's
also not needed?-Tell them to stop!

01:57:04.767 --> 01:57:08.078
Hey fellows, stop it.
Is the sorrow song only this much?

01:57:08.268 --> 01:57:11.340
Enough, enough more than enough.
Run if you want life. - Okay then.

01:57:12.101 --> 01:57:15.480
Those catering people has come
with the food. -Cancel all that.

01:57:15.667 --> 01:57:17.112
Then what to serve
if the people comes?

01:57:17.601 --> 01:57:19.603
For the people to come is your
funeral taking place here?

01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:22.406
All that father will call and block it.
Boss is that required?

01:57:22.567 --> 01:57:24.774
We can arrange a girl
from somewhere isn't it? - Yes.

01:57:25.101 --> 01:57:26.546
The food and people
they are all ready, no?

01:57:26.667 --> 01:57:30.080
That registrar has agreed
to come at any mid night.

01:57:30.267 --> 01:57:33.737
That Rani Kabeer is still waiting,
boss you just say a word, rest we'll manage.

01:57:34.134 --> 01:57:35.078
<i>I'll slap you!</i>

01:57:39.201 --> 01:57:41.340
Please go man without disturbing.

01:57:41.567 --> 01:57:43.979
Come come other wise we'll
have to go in search of beer.

01:57:44.101 --> 01:57:47.571
Vikrama, come here.
What was it?

01:57:49.001 --> 01:57:51.982
Your next duty is on that
locality where that Hima stays.

01:57:52.134 --> 01:57:53.613
You should watch her as
she shouldn't know that.

01:57:54.034 --> 01:57:55.536
Who and all are coming
and going from there...

01:57:55.634 --> 01:57:58.615
...what is happening there each minute
you must report it to me. Okay.

01:57:58.734 --> 01:58:00.441
Okay boss.

01:58:17.601 --> 01:58:21.743
Its raining not taken an umbrella.
It is watering plants, no?

01:58:23.267 --> 01:58:26.476
What's up man? - Yesterday night
an incident has happened here.

01:58:26.601 --> 01:58:31.050
What incident?-His father, mom and
everyone they all left by yesterday itself.

01:58:31.267 --> 01:58:32.371
Doesn't think they will return again.

01:58:33.601 --> 01:58:34.671
Is Shivani and Hima there itself?

01:58:35.034 --> 01:58:37.537
Shivani is here.
Hima madam has gone to temple.

01:58:37.734 --> 01:58:41.511
At that time one more incident took
place. -Again what incident?

01:58:41.667 --> 01:58:44.580
Did she come back?
No, another lady came from Bombay.

01:58:44.734 --> 01:58:47.544
Then? -Now along with Shivani
that Bombay lady is inside.

01:58:47.668 --> 01:58:52.583
Hima madam has not returned from
temple also, should I do anything soon?

01:58:52.768 --> 01:58:56.272
Don't mess any more, whatever
happens report it to me.

01:58:56.467 --> 01:58:59.107
Okay boss, don't
don't cut the phone.

01:58:59.267 --> 01:59:00.678
Again one more incident.

01:59:03.567 --> 01:59:05.604
Look Hima madam
has returned from temple.

01:59:11.634 --> 01:59:15.548
Mummy from Pune a friend has
come who has studied with you.

01:59:16.034 --> 01:59:19.311
From Pune? Who is it?
Told the name as Manitha.

01:59:22.067 --> 01:59:24.013
She is sitting inside.

01:59:42.067 --> 01:59:44.445
Without telling you a word, I...

01:59:45.767 --> 01:59:48.714
In a situation like that you
can only do like that isn't it?

01:59:49.134 --> 01:59:49.737
Then...

01:59:51.767 --> 01:59:54.441
I was the one who
introduced you to Sanjay.

01:59:58.401 --> 01:59:59.209
Sit.

02:00:00.334 --> 02:00:01.642
On coming to know that you
and child was present here...

02:00:01.801 --> 02:00:03.474
...first thought of calling.

02:00:03.667 --> 02:00:05.578
Then felt like coming
and meeting directly.

02:00:06.034 --> 02:00:09.641
Has it created any trouble for you?
No, I got relaxed now only.

02:00:12.067 --> 02:00:15.742
There is one more reason why
I came to meet you and the child.

02:00:16.201 --> 02:00:18.738
I came to know that again
you are going back to Pune...

02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:20.977
...and starts to live with Sanjay.

02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:22.745
Is that true?

02:00:25.534 --> 02:00:28.037
Hima are you again going
tojump into danger?

02:00:28.601 --> 02:00:32.606
That too after knowing all his past.
Aren't you done with what you suffered?

02:00:33.134 --> 02:00:35.239
Do you think that I'll
again do such a mistake?

02:00:40.101 --> 02:00:44.481
First Sanjay and later parents
had come with the same plan.

02:00:44.801 --> 02:00:46.610
To take me to Pune.

02:00:47.434 --> 02:00:50.040
Thinking that I and child will
come, no one need to wait here.

02:00:50.167 --> 02:00:52.443
For that no one need
to come here again.

02:00:56.068 --> 02:00:57.308
Never any of us will come.

02:00:57.734 --> 02:01:01.375
But only for one time
you should come to Pune.

02:01:02.267 --> 02:01:03.610
If I say I won't come
then I won't come.

02:01:04.001 --> 02:01:07.778
Daughter you shouldn't say like
that all our life is in your hands.

02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:20.271
For the mistake he did, not
only you we are also suffering.

02:01:20.467 --> 02:01:25.280
This me who is in this situation and her
before getting killed by those cruels.

02:01:25.501 --> 02:01:29.449
Only for once we came
to beg by catching your leg.

02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:34.580
While you planned to leave Pune
did he gave anything to you?

02:01:34.734 --> 02:01:36.736
To keep it safe?

02:01:37.068 --> 02:01:39.207
Or is that a lie which he tells?

02:01:45.401 --> 02:01:47.608
When I was giving
that bag in your hands.

02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:50.144
While you kept that
in the bank locker.

02:01:50.434 --> 02:01:54.974
I didn't say what it was.
Neither you had asked that also.

02:01:55.234 --> 02:01:56.406
Where is it now?

02:01:57.101 --> 02:02:00.412
That one will be in that
bank locker itself.

02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:05.109
For that one only they
tried to kill me on that day.

02:02:07.034 --> 02:02:11.039
When police and later when
they interrogated me cruelly.

02:02:11.534 --> 02:02:16.005
I didn't say anything about you or
about that locker in the bank.

02:02:20.568 --> 02:02:23.777
But they also know that
you are in here.

02:02:24.134 --> 02:02:27.138
Before they reach here
in search of you and the child.

02:02:27.434 --> 02:02:30.643
We should take that from
the locker and return it to them.

02:02:38.001 --> 02:02:40.038
To activate that banks locker...

02:02:40.234 --> 02:02:42.475
...they returned after signing
and receiving all papers.

02:02:43.501 --> 02:02:47.472
You are in a big trap.
Should suffer no?

02:02:47.701 --> 02:02:51.239
For a mistake done
once a big punishment.

02:02:51.367 --> 02:02:53.608
You tell when you are
going I'll also come with you.

02:02:53.734 --> 02:02:57.045
For any help which I
can do, I'm there with you.

02:03:04.801 --> 02:03:07.611
Boss got busted he returned
again at the mid night.

02:03:07.767 --> 02:03:09.303
Why is he coming at night?
Yes.

02:03:10.367 --> 02:03:13.405
At this time Hima madam,
child and that Bombay lady...

02:03:13.767 --> 02:03:16.008
...slowly they are coming out.

02:03:21.734 --> 02:03:24.715
Boss got busted again
they are hugging.

02:03:25.067 --> 02:03:27.172
Between whom?
That Bombay lady and him.

02:03:27.334 --> 02:03:30.577
We are saved boss, now
Hima madam is free no?

02:03:31.067 --> 02:03:36.244
Never expected me here, no? When
they are here I should come, no?

02:03:43.601 --> 02:03:49.244
Hima, one minute I came running
knowing that Manitha is here.

02:03:49.734 --> 02:03:52.340
I need to talk few things.

02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:55.781
Its late at night, see you
later good night.

02:04:03.667 --> 02:04:07.581
Boss he was not allowed
to enter inside.

02:04:07.734 --> 02:04:10.237
Hima madam kicked him
outside and closed the door.

02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:12.573
Most probably might have locked.
Cut the phone, you fool!

02:04:13.067 --> 02:04:15.513
This is the problem on saying a
good thing will fire on that one also.

02:04:21.067 --> 02:04:24.446
Has he left? This is the
goodness of higher education.

02:04:24.601 --> 02:04:28.048
If at all another lady hugs
own husband no issues at all.

02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:30.476
When I touched behind the
back of the maid by mistake...

02:04:30.667 --> 02:04:33.671
...my country wife bet me
with a coconut scraper.

02:04:34.134 --> 02:04:35.704
Low class wife.

02:04:43.301 --> 02:04:47.215
Manitha what is your plan? What
is the intention behind this arrival?

02:04:47.567 --> 02:04:50.241
Ten years back by giving
the money which you asked.

02:04:50.434 --> 02:04:53.472
After delegating you the goal
I'm still in that same goal.

02:04:53.601 --> 02:04:58.380
I must get that. - Manitha, for the
money which was given by you.

02:04:59.667 --> 02:05:02.204
I'll pay it to you as compensation.

02:05:02.601 --> 02:05:05.673
Because of you for ten years
of my life span I was jailed.

02:05:06.034 --> 02:05:07.513
For that what com pensation
can you give?

02:05:07.601 --> 02:05:11.572
I was also jailed, no?
For ten years.

02:05:13.100 --> 02:05:16.980
Manitha, Hima
after so much compulsion...

02:05:17.101 --> 02:05:19.672
mag reed to come with
me and take that.

02:05:20.101 --> 02:05:21.705
You don't make that to cancel.

02:05:25.134 --> 02:05:28.581
As per our old agreement
you should give that to me.

02:05:37.167 --> 02:05:42.378
Then there is no need to talk
between us. I'll look into my means.

02:05:51.301 --> 02:05:55.408
From Canada parents had
called told sending our visa.

02:05:57.234 --> 02:06:00.272
My tension is not that
one Shivani won't come.

02:06:00.767 --> 02:06:03.611
Leaving Adhi and papa
she won't come from here.

02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:08.078
But somehow I must
take her to Canada.

02:06:08.767 --> 02:06:12.214
On reaching there we'll
never come back to here.

02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:14.778
For that I've told a big lie to her.

02:06:15.467 --> 02:06:19.381
<i>To</i> see <i>grandpa and grandma will go
Canada and on coming back will</i> live...

02:06:19.634 --> 02:06:24.982
...along with Adhi and papa
as she wishes.

02:06:26.434 --> 02:06:31.076
Poor one on believing
that lie she is happy.

02:06:31.534 --> 02:06:33.445
She and Ad hi.

My god!
Daughter!

02:12:04.101 --> 02:12:07.344
Hima its not those people.
- Didn't I say that I'll come with you...

02:12:07.434 --> 02:12:10.074
...and take that from locker. Why
again torturing us along with them?

02:12:10.234 --> 02:12:11.645
Didn't I say its not them?

02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:14.740
If anything happens to
Ad hi, Shivani or that person.

02:12:15.134 --> 02:12:19.207
I'll never come to Pune or
you will ever get that one.

02:12:19.401 --> 02:12:21.574
Go and tell them.
Hima try to understand what I say.

02:12:25.001 --> 02:12:28.039
Look Adhi and papa is coming by
hiding this much falseness in the mind.

02:12:28.134 --> 02:12:29.408
I can't face them again.

02:12:36.067 --> 02:12:38.479
How is daughtefs hand?
Papa that's all right.

02:12:38.701 --> 02:12:41.580
But mummy is really upset
her mind was changed.

02:12:41.768 --> 02:12:45.079
Then again at that time.
That's all okay. I'll tell sorry to her.

02:12:45.201 --> 02:12:46.236
Come.

02:12:48.168 --> 02:12:51.240
Mr. Bhaskar, Hima is lying
has got a head ache.

02:12:51.434 --> 02:12:53.778
Can't meet her now.
You are her head ache.

02:12:54.067 --> 02:12:55.375
Move back foreigner.

02:12:55.634 --> 02:12:59.446
Hello, told you only
can't meet her now.

02:13:06.167 --> 02:13:12.243
Can you go from here? Why all are
torturing me? Give some peace of mind.

02:13:15.468 --> 02:13:17.072
All that is said is meant about you.

02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:20.372
There is no one in this
place without getting my slaps.

02:13:20.601 --> 02:13:25.414
These are outsiders why are you
bringing men from Bombay and Pune?

02:13:25.767 --> 02:13:30.147
That too weak ones if you are
bringing, bring men with swords, guns.

02:13:30.401 --> 02:13:33.041
Or tell Bhaskar will
come to your place.

02:13:33.201 --> 02:13:35.112
That is what Bhaskar likes.

02:13:39.100 --> 02:13:41.979
All though scolded papa
mummy is really upset on that.

02:13:42.401 --> 02:13:46.213
Or papa wait and see to see us
going mummy will come on top.

02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:55.105
Hey man fool aren't
you a boy? Will boys cry?

02:14:55.367 --> 02:14:57.677
We are not going to give
Shivani and mother to anyone.

02:14:57.801 --> 02:15:00.145
You don't cry thinking that,
papa is telling no?

02:15:01.101 --> 02:15:04.241
Now I cried not thinking
about mummy, papa.

02:15:04.601 --> 02:15:06.638
Then?
Thinking about papa.

02:15:07.268 --> 02:15:13.776
For what? - My papa being ridiculed
getting belittled. Its all for me, no?

02:15:14.267 --> 02:15:17.976
Just because I wished
to live with mummy, no?

02:15:18.267 --> 02:15:20.247
Mummy doesn't love papa.

02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:26.175
No need of it papa, I also don't
want mummy who doesn't like papa.

02:15:32.567 --> 02:15:35.138
What is this? Again crying?

02:15:35.634 --> 02:15:39.514
If you don't want why should
I boy? For us we are enough.

02:15:39.634 --> 02:15:41.773
Is it okay, com e.

02:15:50.401 --> 02:15:52.108
Careful.

02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:11.672
Shall we go?

02:16:26.234 --> 02:16:28.043
I'll manage.

02:16:29.034 --> 02:16:32.572
Shivani come and get in. - No.
Didn't I say to come?

02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:35.476
No, without papa
I won't come anywhere.

02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:37.771
Not going any where
like that this is for few days, no?

02:16:38.101 --> 02:16:42.277
After going will return here no?
- No mummy won't come, she is lying I know.

02:16:44.134 --> 02:16:46.136
Come here girl.
If you force me and take.

02:16:46.268 --> 02:16:48.406
Without seen by anyone
I'll run from the air port.

02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:53.179
Leave I'll bring her there.

02:16:53.367 --> 02:16:56.075
Sure.
No need.

02:16:57.267 --> 02:17:00.736
Shivani you don't be stern
like this and upset mummy.

02:17:02.134 --> 02:17:04.477
Hima you come here.

02:17:07.767 --> 02:17:11.111
Right now you are going
for a very dangerous task.

02:17:11.267 --> 02:17:13.304
Its better that daughter
shouldn't be there.

02:17:13.467 --> 02:17:18.040
Right now she is in the safest hands
on earth, they why do you fear?

02:17:21.034 --> 02:17:23.639
He is telling that he'll bring the
daughter over there isn't it?

02:17:24.134 --> 02:17:25.737
You go boldly.

02:18:40.734 --> 02:18:42.406
Hello Jennifer.

02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:50.150

Once it is handed over to me.

Hard core rascal.

and that lady was not his mother.

assurance. - Won't come.

02:24:15.534 --> 02:24:19.243
Once I get this, I'll never come.

02:24:21.067 --> 02:24:24.173
Can't give this to him. The master
brain of this belongs to me.

02:24:24.434 --> 02:24:27.040
He has collected the
money for that already.

02:24:27.133 --> 02:24:29.443

papa will fly and come there, no?

02:26:25.667 --> 02:26:27.112
Than what?

02:26:27.801 --> 02:26:31.146
On hearing yourwords and If I
and your mummy joined together.

02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:33.439
That would have
been an universal blunder.

02:26:33.667 --> 02:26:36.546
When you grow up and become big
you will attend to your own matters, no?

02:26:36.701 --> 02:26:41.081
And then for whom we'll live?
To live like that should like each other.

02:26:41.267 --> 02:26:43.679
If that's not there better
not to join together.

02:26:45.134 --> 02:26:48.411

beautifully in a nice way.

Is it so? I'm sorry.
Why should Adhi say sorry?

02:27:47.267 --> 02:27:50.009
Adhi's papa has bet, no?
Has the papa not come?

02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:51.702

02:27:56.134 --> 02:27:58.341
No boss Raszaq failed to the core.

02:27:58.467 --> 02:28:01.448
Then what Abdul Razaq
says is referee cheated him.

02:28:01.601 --> 02:28:03.706
That's true boss only
the first round he has won.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:05.570
And the balance two
rounds I've failed. - That's true.

02:28:05.767 --> 02:28:09.738
Again Razaq was defeated. Boss
what to do with this cheater referee.

02:28:10.100 --> 02:28:11.078
Say something.

02:28:11.467 --> 02:28:14.505
Hey man one minute okay.
Boss says he'll say after one minute.

02:28:14.667 --> 02:28:17.273
Let him think well our
boss, no? We'll give him time.

02:28:17.434 --> 02:28:20.074
Has told to sir before also
not to use phone over here.

02:28:20.267 --> 02:28:21.746
Our Abdul Razaq failed in wrestling.

02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:23.404
On seeing this if the
kids also start to do this?

02:28:23.533 --> 02:28:25.206
Beat them well.
Yes says to beat.

02:28:25.334 --> 02:28:29.111
What is there to look, boss has
told no? Razaq you go and beat.

02:28:29.334 --> 02:28:31.075
Then see this.

02:28:34.334 --> 02:28:37.508
In this who will win, who will...
From now on I won't do it. Last call.

02:28:39.667 --> 02:28:42.477
Abdul Razaq.
Don't beat. Run, run.

02:28:43.267 --> 02:28:44.541
Has he gone?

02:28:48.233 --> 02:28:51.737
Come.
God has she reached here also?

02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:54.546
We'll sit there.

02:29:06.434 --> 02:29:10.610
My boss please save us.

02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:14.475
Telling you to stop.

02:29:17.201 --> 02:29:19.010
Adhi look.

02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:20.474
Shivani!

02:29:33.734 --> 02:29:37.511
Didn't you go to Canada?
Will I allow to go?

02:29:38.134 --> 02:29:39.704
And mummy also doesn't like to go.

02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:43.309
Man one who loves your
papa most is not you or me.

02:29:43.567 --> 02:29:48.641
That's my mummy now you and me,
mummy and papa all are to live together.

02:29:49.300 --> 02:29:58.982
MBRHDRG

02:29:59.334 --> 02:30:04.340
My god, boss!
Why are they making us run?

02:30:07.101 --> 02:30:11.243
If I don't interfere in this they
will be whacked to pulp.

02:30:11.367 --> 02:30:15.144
This is the last fight there won't
be any more. That's for sure.

02:30:15.733 --> 02:30:18.339
There he is.
You run fast they are behind us.

02:30:18.467 --> 02:30:21.175
Boss, save us, save.

02:30:21.601 --> 02:30:25.777
My god owner Bhaskar? - What's
the issue? No issue at all.

02:30:26.100 --> 02:30:27.511
Are these owner's men? - Yea.

02:30:27.667 --> 02:30:31.171
You come here. What is it?
Should have told that before.

02:30:31.367 --> 02:30:34.075
I was saying but because
of panting it didn't come out.

02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:36.771
Declares that he has
won in today's competition.

02:30:37.067 --> 02:30:39.047
How is that possible? - Only that's
possible and only it'll happen.

02:30:39.134 --> 02:30:40.306
Get lost you hairless!

02:30:40.433 --> 02:30:42.208
Like that simply won, no?
Shake hands.

02:30:42.334 --> 02:30:43.711
Make me also winner.

02:30:43.801 --> 02:30:46.111
No need. Here comes Rani Kabeer.

02:30:49.301 --> 02:30:52.373
Time for her to come
or else I would have won.

02:30:56.101 --> 02:30:57.239
One autograph.

02:30:58.134 --> 02:30:58.976
I also want one. - Give it here..

02:30:59.101 --> 02:31:00.774
Those who wants the
sign form the queue, okay go.

02:31:01.167 --> 02:31:03.773
Sign here don't be scared on
seeing the muscle, put it here.

02:31:05.633 --> 02:31:08.512
Scared on seeing the
muscle. Okay put on it.

02:31:10.601 --> 02:31:13.445
Don't look only the sign is there,
there is no phone number.

02:31:30.234 --> 02:31:31.440
I looked at Abdul Razaq.

02:31:32.700 --> 02:31:36.147
On this not only the sign can write
the agreement also, just look.

02:31:36.267 --> 02:31:39.510
"Like a shadow in your thoughts"

02:31:39.601 --> 02:31:43.743
"Smile becomes sweetness
in these sorrows"

02:31:44.100 --> 02:31:47.445
"One naughty fellow is
there as a companion"

02:31:47.634 --> 02:31:54.381
"What is the glitter in those eyes?"

02:31:55.167 --> 02:32:02.745
"Is it the hidden pearl which
is inside the heart?"

02:32:03.101 --> 02:32:09.677
"Weaving thousands of applique
in the mind near the water Lilly"

02:32:10.734 --> 02:32:18.118
"With the tender naughtiness
small birds brushing its wings"

02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:56.448
"You are like a dusk in
the mist of day time"

02:32:56.634 --> 02:33:00.081
"What is the glitter in those eyes?"

02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:03.973
"Is it the hidden pearl
which is inside the heart?"
