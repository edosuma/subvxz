WEBVTT

00:03.041 --> 00:05.202
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

00:36.674 --> 00:39.108
<i>The captain of the Astral
Queen wants you to know...</i>

00:39.177 --> 00:41.338
he's got 1,500 prisoners
under heavy guard.

00:41.412 --> 00:44.745
Tell him I want daily reports on
the well-being of his prisoners.

00:44.816 --> 00:46.750
The President
has given me a direct order.

00:46.818 --> 00:48.445
<i>We're in the middle of a war...</i>

00:48.519 --> 00:50.987
and you're taking orders
from a schoolteacher?

00:51.255 --> 00:52.688
Don't suppose
there's a Plan B?

00:52.757 --> 00:54.816
Plans B, C, D, E
are the same as A.

00:54.892 --> 00:57.053
Get off the planet
and get back to the ship.

00:57.128 --> 00:58.925
How much water did we lose?

00:58.996 --> 01:01.794
Almost 60% of total potable
water reserves.

01:01.866 --> 01:05.529
If we don't find new supplies
they'll run out of water in two days.

01:12.810 --> 01:16.302
<i>Reveille, morning stations
aboard Battlestar Galactica.</i>

01:16.381 --> 01:18.508
<i>All hands report
to your stations.</i>

01:50.948 --> 01:53.940
So, what do we
have? Good news, Colonel.

01:54.018 --> 01:56.680
We scouted the ice moon. Found
an entire subsurface ocean.

01:56.754 --> 01:58.517
We've got reports
and video for you, Sir.

01:58.589 --> 02:01.080
Not exactly Caprica Beach
down there, Chief?

02:01.192 --> 02:04.423
No, sir. We've registered
temperatures 180 and below...

02:04.629 --> 02:08.463
venting of methane and CO2. It's gonna
be a bitch to work down there, sir.

02:08.533 --> 02:12.025
Cheer up. You know how lucky
we are we found this ugly rock?

02:12.103 --> 02:15.732
Water riots breaking out
all over the fleet. Civilians.

02:16.174 --> 02:20.736
Whiney civie cry-babies can't stand
less than a hot shower every day.

02:21.145 --> 02:22.237
Yes, sir.

02:22.313 --> 02:25.214
<i>Even Galactica's down
to 10,000 JPs of water.</i>

02:27.051 --> 02:31.078
Ever see a man die of
dehydration, Chief? No, sir.

02:31.155 --> 02:33.623
Let's hope you never do.
It isn't pretty.

02:36.093 --> 02:38.618
So, where were we?

02:39.764 --> 02:41.698
We drilled 23 core samples.

02:41.766 --> 02:44.030
13% sodium chloride.

02:44.101 --> 02:46.865
What the hell?
We can't drink salt water.

02:46.938 --> 02:50.169
No, sir. That's why
I had Cally test the ice.

02:51.108 --> 02:54.168
Well, there you go.
Pure water.

02:54.412 --> 02:56.505
Couple of lemons,
we could make lemonade.

02:57.748 --> 02:59.079
Yes, sir.

03:00.485 --> 03:03.477
We'll have to melt the ice before
we transport it up to the ship.

03:03.554 --> 03:04.578
What's that gonna take?

03:04.655 --> 03:08.216
High-capacity heater expansion
tanks, D-25 plasma torches...

03:08.292 --> 03:10.089
Myrex hoses,
centrifugal pumps.

03:10.161 --> 03:11.958
Sounds like a lot of manpower.

03:12.029 --> 03:13.758
Ideally 1,000 men, sir.

03:13.831 --> 03:16.356
1,000 men? And where're
they gonna come from?

03:16.567 --> 03:17.659
Slave labor.

03:17.735 --> 03:22.263
They are criminals. They've been sentenced
to hard labor. And this is very hard labor.

03:22.507 --> 03:26.603
Not to mention physically dangerous.
This is not for civilians, but...

03:27.278 --> 03:30.372
Their ship wasn't designed
for long-term incarceration.

03:31.048 --> 03:34.176
These men have been stuck in
cramped cells for weeks now.

03:34.252 --> 03:38.211
They might even prefer to get out.
Do something, even if it is dangerous.

03:38.689 --> 03:42.955
If they volunteer. But these aren't slaves
and I will not have them treated as such.

03:43.027 --> 03:45.962
No. We could offer incentives.

03:46.697 --> 03:48.460
Points towards
earning freedom.

03:48.533 --> 03:49.522
Excuse me.

03:50.401 --> 03:53.700
You wanna start releasing
hardened criminals into the fleet?

03:54.472 --> 03:57.600
Sir, these men were on their way
to Caprica for parole hearings...

03:57.675 --> 03:59.836
which at least implies
they may be ready for release.

04:01.078 --> 04:04.673
Make it happen, Captain.
Yes, sir.

04:04.749 --> 04:08.014
To address Commander Adama's
concerns, I'd like you to go along...

04:08.085 --> 04:11.316
and set up a screening procedure
to weed out the hardened criminals.

04:11.389 --> 04:14.449
<i>I would like to have a
representative from Galactica...</i>

04:14.592 --> 04:17.561
who will report directly to me
about security issues.

04:19.163 --> 04:20.323
How about D?

04:21.299 --> 04:24.291
Second Class Petty Officer
Dualla. I know who she is.

04:24.368 --> 04:27.064
I'm not sure she's conversant
with the technical details.

04:27.138 --> 04:30.130
She'll be fine, but we should
send someone from ground crew...

04:30.207 --> 04:32.971
who'll make sure the chosen
men know to use the equipment.

04:33.044 --> 04:36.036
Agreed. I have to get
to the CIC. Excuse me.

04:36.147 --> 04:38.240
Madam President? The doctor.

04:38.349 --> 04:40.078
Excuse me?
The doctor?

04:41.819 --> 04:45.755
<i>Commander, do you have a
ship's doctor aboard Galactica?</i>

04:45.856 --> 04:50.793
Maj. Cottle. Is there something
wrong? No, nothing urgent. Allergies.

04:51.195 --> 04:54.790
He's out on the fleet
checking medical conditions.

04:55.232 --> 04:58.065
I'll tell him that you
want to see him. Thanks.

04:59.937 --> 05:04.271
Petty Officer Dualla.
Conversant in technical details.

05:05.076 --> 05:07.169
Thinking entirely
of the mission.

05:11.148 --> 05:13.048
Something on your mind,
Captain?

05:13.117 --> 05:15.915
I just thought maybe you had
something you wanted to say.

05:16.087 --> 05:19.887
I have nothing to say to the personal
representative of the President.

05:20.257 --> 05:22.521
<i>I'm still Galactica's
lead pilot.</i>

05:23.394 --> 05:25.692
I have nothing
to say to him, either.

05:28.299 --> 05:32.326
Every man has to decide for
themselves which side they're on.

05:34.105 --> 05:36.300
I didn't know
we were picking sides.

05:40.177 --> 05:42.475
That's why you haven't picked
one yet.

05:45.149 --> 05:47.140
<i>I'm a bus driver, not a warden.</i>

05:47.318 --> 05:49.513
How many total?
1,500.

05:50.021 --> 05:52.182
They don't give me their files
or their names.

05:52.256 --> 05:55.384
Hell, they're just numbers.
Thanks, Wilkens.

05:57.595 --> 06:00.996
All right. They're all yours.

06:08.906 --> 06:13.036
<i>I'm Capt. Lee Adama, personal
representative of the President.</i>

06:13.277 --> 06:14.869
<i>We're in a crisis.</i>

06:15.646 --> 06:18.911
<i>Thousands of us are on the
verge of dying from dehydration.</i>

06:19.183 --> 06:21.743
<i>The good news is
we have found water.</i>

06:22.853 --> 06:27.290
<i>The bad news is, it's located on a moon
with harsh environmental conditions.</i>

06:28.526 --> 06:32.087
<i>We need 1,000 able-bodied men
to help us get that water.</i>

06:32.963 --> 06:36.797
<i>President Roslin feels that
you represent our best chance.</i>

06:37.968 --> 06:41.062
<i>She also recognizes
that you are not slaves.</i>

06:41.706 --> 06:46.268
<i>Any man who volunteers to help us during
this emergency will earn "freedom points"...</i>

06:47.111 --> 06:49.841
<i>which can be applied
toward earning his release.</i>

06:50.414 --> 06:53.144
<i>We're offering you a chance
for a new beginning.</i>

06:53.417 --> 06:57.183
<i>Whoever is interested, please
just step out of your cell.</i>

07:38.295 --> 07:40.024
Thank you for your offer.

07:41.465 --> 07:44.525
We respectfully decline.

07:44.602 --> 07:45.899
Zarek.

07:46.637 --> 07:49.299
Oh, my God, that's Tom Zarek.

07:50.941 --> 07:52.306
The terrorist?

07:53.544 --> 07:55.876
Zarek.

09:25.334 --> 09:28.861
So who the hell is Tom Zarek?
He's a freedom fighter.

09:30.005 --> 09:33.441
He's a prisoner of conscience.
He's a butcher.

09:33.909 --> 09:37.436
His colony was exploited
by the other 11 for centuries.

09:37.513 --> 09:39.276
His people were marginalized,
brutalized...

09:39.348 --> 09:42.181
I'm from Saggitaron, and that
man doesn't speak for all of us.

09:42.251 --> 09:44.981
He blew up a government building,
there's no excuse for that.

09:45.054 --> 09:46.715
Captain, I've been watching
the clock...

09:46.789 --> 09:49.280
and if we won't get any help,
we should move on.

09:49.358 --> 09:52.555
Zarek's got the prisoners
united. Let's go through Zarek.

10:00.035 --> 10:03.095
Hello? Anybody out there?

10:04.974 --> 10:07.340
Anybody wanna help
two stranded pilots?

10:08.944 --> 10:12.004
That's what I hate about big
cities. No one will help you.

10:12.081 --> 10:14.572
No more shouting.
You're making me nervous.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.213
Feel like I'm in a movie.

10:18.020 --> 10:20.921
At least it stopped raining.
For now.

10:24.393 --> 10:26.122
Where is everyone?

10:27.196 --> 10:30.359
Some are dead.
In their beds, at their desks.

10:31.300 --> 10:34.565
Ones who weren't killed outright
probably ran into the hills.

10:34.637 --> 10:36.070
Won't do any good.

10:39.375 --> 10:41.866
Guess I'm getting a little...
Depressing? Morbid?

10:41.977 --> 10:46.539
Sorry. Been here longer than you.
Wish I could say it gets easier.

10:53.022 --> 10:56.048
There's more. Boomer,
you might not wanna...

10:59.728 --> 11:02.094
Frakking rats. Let's go.

11:05.768 --> 11:07.235
Come on.

11:07.503 --> 11:10.768
Let's find a hospital, score
some anti-radiation meds, okay?

11:10.873 --> 11:12.864
We've only got
two days' worth left.

11:12.942 --> 11:16.469
Sharon, we've made it this far.
We're gonna make it all the way.

11:16.579 --> 11:19.412
Right.
Damn straight, all the way.

11:19.482 --> 11:21.382
We're doing good, real good.

11:22.351 --> 11:24.876
I guess someone must be
watching out for us.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.091
She's good.

11:33.929 --> 11:35.487
So far.
Jealous?

11:36.932 --> 11:38.923
This all makes me
so sad.

11:39.001 --> 11:42.835
They would've destroyed themselves
anyway. They deserve what they got.

11:43.038 --> 11:46.701
We're the children of humanity. That
makes them our parents, in a sense.

11:46.809 --> 11:49.778
True. But parents have to die.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.776
It's the only way children
come into their own.

12:00.155 --> 12:01.884
No, that's not necessary.

12:05.427 --> 12:07.122
I'd like to talk to you.

12:08.597 --> 12:12.226
Guard. Prisoner 893893...

12:12.535 --> 12:15.163
requests permission
to speak with his visitor.

12:15.371 --> 12:16.633
Granted.

12:16.739 --> 12:19.936
We're not allowed to speak
unless asked a direct question.

12:20.809 --> 12:23.209
And you didn't ask me
a direct question.

12:23.512 --> 12:26.640
You've never been in a prison
before, have you, Captain?

12:26.815 --> 12:28.783
No.
You're fortunate.

12:29.952 --> 12:32.147
May I sit down?
Yes, of course.

12:58.881 --> 13:00.576
We need these men of yours
to help us.

13:00.649 --> 13:03.482
They're not my men.
They belong to you.

13:03.953 --> 13:05.944
I belong to you. You own us.

13:06.989 --> 13:09.457
You're the master,
we're the slaves.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.067
You're clearly
a man of principle.

13:21.303 --> 13:23.498
I respect that.
Really?

13:24.106 --> 13:27.542
The things you've stood for over
the years, the book you wrote.

13:27.610 --> 13:30.340
The book that had to be
smuggled out of labor camp...

13:30.412 --> 13:33.870
because stumps aren't allowed
freedom of expression?

13:34.116 --> 13:36.050
I read it. In college.

13:36.719 --> 13:39.381
Thought it was radical,
challenging.

13:40.389 --> 13:44.519
Made me question some things I'd
accepted before without thinking.

13:45.094 --> 13:47.062
Nice to hear
I'm a big hit on campus.

13:47.129 --> 13:50.121
You weren't, the book was
banned. I read it anyway.

13:50.199 --> 13:54.329
Point is, I understand
where you're coming from.

13:54.503 --> 13:58.269
But I don't think you understand how
critical the situation is out there.

13:58.340 --> 14:00.638
People are gonna start dying.

14:02.845 --> 14:05.837
Hey, Starke.
It's time for your break.

14:09.451 --> 14:10.577
How can you say that?

14:10.653 --> 14:11.779
It's the truth.

14:11.854 --> 14:14.015
Zarek and the SFM,
they don't care about justice.

14:14.089 --> 14:16.216
His people, your people
have been exploited.

14:16.291 --> 14:17.815
You cannot tell me
about my people.

14:17.893 --> 14:19.588
I'm not telling you
about your people.

14:20.396 --> 14:24.230
All I want,
the President wants...

14:24.500 --> 14:27.128
is to offer you a chance
to earn your freedom.

14:27.302 --> 14:29.236
Now you've said the truth...

14:29.705 --> 14:32.503
freedom is earned.

14:40.883 --> 14:44.080
Stay where you are, Captain.
It'll all be over soon.

14:48.457 --> 14:51.290
Nobody try anything. Back up.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.687
We've got the guards and the crew

15:25.758 --> 15:27.089
in separate cells in Block 7.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.392
Mason is looking
after the hostages.

15:29.796 --> 15:30.990
Nice job.

15:31.064 --> 15:35.967
Everything's under control. The men
are organizing exactly as planned.

15:36.202 --> 15:38.033
I knew I could count on you.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.837
Stay frosty there, Billy.
Everything's gonna be all right.

15:43.509 --> 15:44.498
I don't know about that.

15:44.577 --> 15:47.341
They don't wanna hurt us. That
won't get them what they want.

15:47.413 --> 15:48.675
Which is what?

15:54.187 --> 15:57.623
Lt. Thrace. Good to see you.
Good to see you, too.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.214
Really?
No.

16:04.230 --> 16:07.131
I wonder if she's a
real blonde. I doubt it.

16:14.440 --> 16:18.240
Now, one of you has been
coming in a little hot lately.

16:18.311 --> 16:22.577
A little too hot. A little, I don't know.
He's burning up the deck with his skids...

16:22.649 --> 16:26.847
because he can't pull back on the
throttle. Who is the speed demon, my prince?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.381
Flat-Top, sir.

16:29.689 --> 16:33.147
Flat-Top. You got a need
for speed, do you?

16:33.426 --> 16:37.590
Can't wait to get back to the Big G and
the loving embrace of your fellow pilots?

16:37.664 --> 16:40.462
Or maybe you have a hot date
with your right hand.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.463
It never gets a headache.

16:44.804 --> 16:48.103
Tell you what, Flat-Top,
you come in too hot today...

16:48.207 --> 16:50.300
you may have
to start using your left.

16:51.711 --> 16:55.772
All right. You've been fun, you've
been a great audience. Dismissed.

17:02.255 --> 17:05.918
There's no smoking in the ready
room. My room, my rules, sir.

17:05.992 --> 17:08.927
Where's your mummy?
Dead. Where's yours?

17:09.495 --> 17:13.329
I'm looking for Boomer. 1400.
Boomer's in the tool room.

17:16.836 --> 17:20.397
A pilot blows his landings
and you make a joke out of it?

17:20.506 --> 17:23.566
Screaming at people doesn't
always get the best results, sir.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.736
I learned that
at officer candidate school.

17:25.812 --> 17:29.213
You are right on the edge,
Thrace. Careful you don't fall off.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.111
Speaking of falling off...

17:32.385 --> 17:35.354
glad to see you've found a way
to quench your thirst.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.794
They won't negotiate
while you're holding hostages.

17:50.870 --> 17:54.863
I don't wanna negotiate.
Then what do you want?

17:54.941 --> 17:57.409
To be treated like men,
not animals.

17:57.944 --> 18:01.903
Finally have something to
bargain with. So what happens now?

18:08.221 --> 18:10.655
We're gonna talk.
What about?

18:11.691 --> 18:12.885
Your father.

18:15.294 --> 18:18.229
Is this a Monclair original?
Yes.

18:18.297 --> 18:21.027
Fantastic.
Would you like some water?

18:22.368 --> 18:24.165
Yes, thank you.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.169
I'm not a collector myself,
but I...

18:28.775 --> 18:31.903
I am familiar with his work,
and may I say...

18:32.145 --> 18:36.582
you really do have an excellent
eye for art. Thank you.

18:38.918 --> 18:43.321
Where's my Cylon
detector, Doctor? Oh, that.

18:45.158 --> 18:49.288
Yes, it's taking longer
than expected, unfortunately.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.199
What's the hang-up?

18:55.168 --> 18:59.434
It's not working this time, Gaius.
He can see right through you.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.473
There are a number
of obstacles...

19:02.742 --> 19:06.644
none of them insurmountable,
but they do tend to slow us down.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.744
For a start,
the lack of proper facilities.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.484
The water shortage, of course.

19:12.618 --> 19:15.587
The water shortage, not
to mention... Cut the BS.

19:17.056 --> 19:20.082
You said you had a way
of detecting human from Cylon.

19:21.427 --> 19:23.054
Do you or don't you?

19:28.768 --> 19:30.929
I don't.
What?

19:32.138 --> 19:35.335
I don't think
that I'm the man for this job.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.669
I'm not cut out
for this kind of work.

19:37.743 --> 19:40.803
You have to do this.
Why do I keep putting it off?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.576
It's my subconscious
telling me...

19:44.183 --> 19:46.743
that I'm not the man
for this job, please.

19:46.919 --> 19:50.855
Listen to me. If you don't tell
him what he wants to hear...

19:51.390 --> 19:53.187
he's going to find you out.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.657
And when he does, they're
going to tear your head off...

19:56.729 --> 19:58.822
and throw your body
out of an air lock.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.498
Pardon me.

20:04.971 --> 20:08.498
I haven't had
much sleep recently, so...

20:12.278 --> 20:15.111
Unfortunately, Doctor,
for both of us...

20:17.149 --> 20:18.980
you're the last man we have.

20:21.587 --> 20:23.885
So what's the game plan, Doc?

20:27.493 --> 20:29.120
This is what you say...

20:30.363 --> 20:33.799
"Commander, the truth is,
there is one way."

20:34.901 --> 20:37.734
Say it!
Commander, the truth is...

20:38.404 --> 20:39.769
there is one way.

20:39.939 --> 20:40.997
I didn't wanna have...

20:41.073 --> 20:42.870
I didn't wanna have
to ask you for this...

20:42.942 --> 20:45.706
but what I really need
to complete the project...

20:45.778 --> 20:48.508
is a nuclear...

20:49.248 --> 20:50.272
warhead.

20:54.320 --> 20:58.120
That how you got to be the "personal
representative of the President?"

20:58.925 --> 21:02.486
Because of your father?
Hardly.

21:04.263 --> 21:08.199
So, they don't get along,
Adama and Roslin?

21:08.267 --> 21:10.098
They have their differences.

21:10.236 --> 21:13.034
But not when it comes
to dealing with terrorists.

21:14.774 --> 21:18.437
I thought you said you
respected me. Read my book.

21:18.711 --> 21:22.078
That was before you resorted
to violence and hostage-taking.

21:23.215 --> 21:26.446
Always better when the oppressed
don't fight back, isn't it?

21:26.519 --> 21:27.781
A warhead?

21:28.921 --> 21:31.446
Technically, I need the plutonium inside.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.992
Technically, I need
the plutonium inside.

21:34.927 --> 21:37.020
Figure out the rest
for yourself.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.093
As you may know,
the Cylons are...

21:42.134 --> 21:44.534
susceptible to
certain kinds of radiation...

21:44.604 --> 21:47.402
and by taking the plutonium...

21:48.407 --> 21:49.396
and...

21:53.145 --> 21:55.670
embedding it in a
carbon nanotube matrix...

21:57.450 --> 22:00.044
and it really is
that simple...

22:02.588 --> 22:06.388
I can construct a filter that will
preferentially ionize synthetic molecules...

22:06.459 --> 22:08.654
and thus deliver to you
your Cylons.

22:14.066 --> 22:17.126
We have five warheads
left aboard this ship.

22:23.809 --> 22:26.039
We may need them.
Yes, of course.

22:26.112 --> 22:29.843
If you really think that this
project has a low priority...

22:29.915 --> 22:33.043
then you're totally within
your bounds to...

22:40.426 --> 22:42.121
You'll get your warhead.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.196
Good boy.

22:47.933 --> 22:50.367
Thank you, Commander.

22:52.538 --> 22:56.975
Look, the master-at-arms has been
over every inch of that locker.

22:57.476 --> 22:59.137
She's come up with nothing.

22:59.211 --> 23:02.078
So they've got no idea who
took those six G-4 charges...

23:02.148 --> 23:05.743
or who put that detonator in...
Don't worry about it.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.116
I'll take care of it, okay?

23:16.362 --> 23:18.922
I need to speak
with the Lieutenant, alone.

23:27.339 --> 23:30.740
You don't honestly think you've
been fooling everyone, do you?

23:31.377 --> 23:34.608
I know. The old man knows.

23:35.181 --> 23:38.048
Hell, the whole ship
knows about you and the Chief.

23:38.217 --> 23:40.082
It stops. Now.

23:40.986 --> 23:42.544
Sir, the Chief and I
are just friends.

23:42.621 --> 23:45.784
When the ship was being decommissioned,
we let you two get away with it.

23:45.858 --> 23:49.350
Hell, we let everyone get away with
murder. That was then and this is now.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.693
We're at war, this is a combat unit
and you're his superior officer.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.563
Put a stop to it.
That's an order.

23:56.602 --> 23:57.660
Yes, sir.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.304
<i>Attention. Pass the word for Col.
Tigh.</i>

24:00.406 --> 24:02.966
<i>Col. Tigh, please report
to the CIC.</i>

24:06.946 --> 24:11.246
<i>The crew are my prisoners.
They will not be harmed.</i>

24:11.784 --> 24:13.615
Are you recording
this? Yes, sir.

24:13.819 --> 24:16.253
What's this?
Trouble.

24:16.322 --> 24:19.621
<i>But I have two conditions
before I release my captives.</i>

24:20.292 --> 24:24.023
First, the government
which controls our fate...

24:24.563 --> 24:26.724
is illegal and illegitimate...

24:27.900 --> 24:30.892
<i>and it must submit
to the will of the people.</i>

24:31.137 --> 24:34.129
<i>I demand the
immediate resignation...</i>

24:34.206 --> 24:36.834
<i>of Laura Roslin
and her ministers.</i>

24:37.610 --> 24:42.274
Second, I demand free and open
elections to choose a new leadership.

24:43.082 --> 24:46.483
<i>And a new government that
represents all of the people.</i>

24:46.685 --> 24:48.880
<i>These demands
are made not for me...</i>

24:49.155 --> 24:51.715
<i>or the former slaves
held on this ship...</i>

24:52.291 --> 24:56.591
but for you, the people, the
survivors of the holocaust...

24:57.563 --> 25:01.260
<i>and the children
of humanity's future.</i>

25:02.001 --> 25:03.468
I am Tom Zarek...

25:04.236 --> 25:07.569
and this is the first day
of the new era.

25:11.743 --> 25:15.372
We've jammed his transmissions.
A little bit late for that.

25:15.446 --> 25:18.574
Every ship in the fleet heard
that broadcast. It doesn't matter.

25:18.650 --> 25:21.175
It does matter. He's trying
to bring down the government.

25:21.252 --> 25:22.913
<i>No one's gonna
take it seriously.</i>

25:22.987 --> 25:26.548
You have something to learn when it
comes to public opinion, Commander.

25:26.624 --> 25:28.421
<i>Tom Zarek is a name
with weight.</i>

25:28.493 --> 25:30.984
<i>He's a very sympathetic
figure. A legend, almost.</i>

25:31.062 --> 25:33.428
20 years in prison
over a matter of principle.

25:33.498 --> 25:36.831
He's a criminal and a terrorist.
People won't give him credence.

25:36.901 --> 25:38.732
<i>Don't be so sure, Commander.</i>

25:38.803 --> 25:42.899
Rebellions are contagious. People are
already rioting over the water crisis.

25:43.074 --> 25:46.202
<i>We can't afford to destabilize
this government right now.</i>

25:46.277 --> 25:49.212
I agree.
When are you going in?

25:50.782 --> 25:53.250
I assumed you were gonna talk
to him first.

25:53.318 --> 25:57.482
We don't negotiate with
terrorists. I said talk.

25:57.555 --> 26:00.888
There's nothing to talk about.
What he wants, I can't give him.

26:00.959 --> 26:04.486
We're not ready yet. Talking to
Zarek gives us a little bit more time.

26:04.562 --> 26:08.464
That's what he wants, legitimacy.
He wants to be recognized.

26:09.567 --> 26:11.501
He wants his crimes validated.

26:12.003 --> 26:15.268
I watched President Adar offer him
a full pardon if he'd apologize...

26:15.340 --> 26:16.500
and give up violence...

26:16.574 --> 26:19.099
<i>as a means of political
change. He refused.</i>

26:24.015 --> 26:28.349
No commitments. No deals.
I'll let you know what happens.

26:30.688 --> 26:33.054
Three assault teams.
Alpha, Bravo, Constellation.

26:33.157 --> 26:36.888
We jam their dradis, the Raptors cut
through the hull here, here and here...

26:36.961 --> 26:39.259
without being seen. Once
we're inside, Alpha takes...

26:39.330 --> 26:40.854
What's this "we" crap?

26:40.932 --> 26:43.093
I'm going, sir.
Like hell.

26:44.068 --> 26:46.593
<i>We have a few marines
left on Galactica.</i>

26:47.839 --> 26:50.433
Let them handle it, Starbuck.
They don't have a sniper.

26:50.508 --> 26:53.705
With all due respect, I'm the
best shot in or out of the cockpit.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.973
She's right. For once.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.576
Wonders never cease.

27:03.154 --> 27:04.951
All right, you're going in.

27:05.723 --> 27:10.251
You get a clear shot at Zarek, you take
it. I want to control that ship immediately.

27:10.662 --> 27:13.927
And I want all the
hostages alive. Yes, sir.

27:14.732 --> 27:17.200
I don't even know
how I drew this detail.

27:19.671 --> 27:21.070
President thought
you'd be valuable.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.369
President doesn't know
who I am.

27:26.744 --> 27:29.235
I told her. Sorry.

27:31.082 --> 27:34.017
On the other hand, it's
nice to get out of the CIC.

27:34.452 --> 27:37.387
Break up the day,
meet new people.

27:38.022 --> 27:39.080
Yeah.

27:46.064 --> 27:49.591
You're not asleep.
Not anymore.

27:50.935 --> 27:53.233
Is that your way of telling us
you're not scared?

27:53.304 --> 27:55.772
No, it's my way of telling you
I'm tired.

27:58.009 --> 28:01.410
You don't know what tired is.
Right.

28:01.746 --> 28:05.443
Don't. Don't mock me,
little girl.

28:06.818 --> 28:08.877
I'm not mocking you.

28:10.355 --> 28:13.756
Tom and I, we go way back.
Long time.

28:14.559 --> 28:18.086
If you know what's good for
you, you'll be nice to me.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.976
Frequent wireless contact.

28:33.244 --> 28:36.145
Keep us informed all the way.
Yes, sir.

28:36.314 --> 28:37.679
Good hunting.

28:44.856 --> 28:47.791
Who voted for Laura Roslin?
You?

28:48.259 --> 28:49.658
Did you vote for her?

28:49.727 --> 28:51.160
She was sworn in
under the law.

28:51.229 --> 28:54.357
The answer is,
no one voted for her.

28:55.033 --> 28:58.525
And yet she's making decisions for
all of us, deciding who lives...

28:58.603 --> 29:03.040
and who dies. Is that democracy?
Is that a free society?

29:03.274 --> 29:05.105
What is it you want from me?

29:05.309 --> 29:09.006
You want me to say she shouldn't
be president? We need a government.

29:09.113 --> 29:11.274
We need rules,
we need a leader.

29:11.349 --> 29:14.045
We need to be
free men and women.

29:14.118 --> 29:17.281
If we're not free, then we're
no different than Cylons.

29:21.759 --> 29:24.387
They call you Apollo.
It's my call sign.

29:24.862 --> 29:27.695
Apollo's one of the gods.
A lord of Kobol.

29:27.765 --> 29:31.064
You must be a very special man
to be called the God.

29:32.036 --> 29:33.196
It's just a stupid nickname.

29:33.271 --> 29:37.708
Son of Zeus, good with
the bow, God of the hunt...

29:39.377 --> 29:42.210
and also a God of healing.

29:43.114 --> 29:44.479
Now, a God...

29:44.549 --> 29:48.679
can reconcile those two
opposing forces, but a mortal...

29:50.088 --> 29:53.148
has to pick one side
or the other.

29:55.059 --> 29:57.050
Have you picked a side,
Apollo?

29:58.262 --> 30:02.596
<i>Astral Queen,
this is the Battlestar Galactica.</i>

30:02.967 --> 30:05.959
Commander Adama
wishes to speak to Mr. Zarek.

30:06.404 --> 30:09.805
<i>Please respond.
Zeus is calling.</i>

30:14.378 --> 30:17.677
<i>Commander Adama? Tom Zarek.
How can I help you?</i>

30:18.282 --> 30:21.342
First, I want to make sure
that my people are unharmed.

30:27.125 --> 30:29.559
This is Apollo.
I'm fine, so are the others.

30:29.627 --> 30:32.619
They're located on the lower...
That's enough, thank you.

30:32.697 --> 30:35.131
I'm glad to hear
that no one's been hurt.

30:35.399 --> 30:37.594
That would have
tragic consequences.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.070
How long until
you storm the ship?

30:41.205 --> 30:43.036
I'm hoping
that won't be necessary.

30:43.774 --> 30:47.437
<i>I think that you and I can come
up with some kind of understanding.</i>

30:48.279 --> 30:51.146
This is not the only crisis
that I'm dealing with.

30:52.850 --> 30:55.717
The water shortage
affects the entire fleet.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.753
Your men are on their way
even as we speak.

30:58.823 --> 31:00.916
There's still time
to work this out.

31:00.992 --> 31:03.654
Have the President step down
and call for elections.

31:03.728 --> 31:07.721
That's not gonna happen. Then I
look forward to meeting your men.

31:34.492 --> 31:37.256
I knew you were faking.
I'm a light sleeper.

31:42.900 --> 31:47.132
I don't think I have your
respect. I respect you.

31:48.539 --> 31:49.733
Get up.

31:54.478 --> 31:56.002
Hey, what's going on?

31:58.149 --> 31:59.173
Hey.

32:05.856 --> 32:07.790
What are you doing?
Move.

32:09.994 --> 32:11.723
Where are you taking her?

32:12.330 --> 32:14.958
It's okay, Cally.
You're gonna be okay.

32:15.032 --> 32:17.967
They know where we are, Cally.
Capt. Adama.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.431
Hey. Capt. Adama!

32:21.606 --> 32:24.541
They're willing to talk.
Sounded that way.

32:28.379 --> 32:30.404
You want them
to storm the ship.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.279
Soft seal. Pressurized.

32:39.023 --> 32:40.149
Eyes.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.954
That's it, isn't it?

32:48.966 --> 32:52.663
You don't want elections, you don't
want your freedom. You want a bloodbath.

32:53.304 --> 32:54.430
You don't understand.

32:54.505 --> 32:57.736
Tom Zarek's been out of the
headlines, out of the news...

32:58.242 --> 33:00.642
forgotten for 20 years
as he rots in a cell.

33:00.711 --> 33:03.976
Now he's got a chance to go
out in a blaze of glory...

33:04.815 --> 33:06.442
and he's gonna take it.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.985
Alpha One, we're in.

33:15.760 --> 33:18.661
Once Roslin
uses Adama's soldiers...

33:18.729 --> 33:21.562
to massacre
the people on this ship...

33:21.799 --> 33:23.858
prisoners
and hostages alike...

33:24.769 --> 33:28.671
people in the fleet
will never forgive them.

33:29.407 --> 33:32.274
The entire government
will collapse.

33:39.617 --> 33:43.553
She can take care of herself.
You sure?

33:44.755 --> 33:48.122
She's been trained. We've all
been trained in capture, it's...

33:53.230 --> 33:56.461
You've been saying everything
you're doing is for freedom.

33:56.734 --> 33:58.201
But the truth is...

33:58.369 --> 34:01.463
it's all about Tom Zarek
and his personal death wish.

34:03.107 --> 34:05.632
Tom. Something's up.

34:05.876 --> 34:06.934
Frakking bitch.

34:07.011 --> 34:08.842
That's Mason. What the hell.

34:10.681 --> 34:13.047
They're killing the hostages.
Let's go.

34:22.992 --> 34:24.687
Constellation Team, set.

34:26.296 --> 34:27.456
Mason.

34:29.365 --> 34:30.832
Mason, what're you doing?

34:31.100 --> 34:33.068
Bit my ear off.
Frak you.

34:33.136 --> 34:35.036
Open the door, she's been shot.

34:35.104 --> 34:38.073
You said they weren't animals.
What do you call this?

34:38.241 --> 34:40.573
20 years I've been waiting.

34:41.911 --> 34:43.606
He's gonna kill her.
Do something.

34:43.680 --> 34:47.047
You did this. You put him in
a cage. You made him a monster.

34:51.754 --> 34:53.153
Bravo, set.

34:56.159 --> 34:57.888
You filthy bitch.

34:58.761 --> 35:00.388
You all deserve to die.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.726
You first.

35:06.903 --> 35:08.837
All teams, sniper in position.

35:09.405 --> 35:11.339
He's gonna do it.
You reap what you sow.

35:11.407 --> 35:14.638
You look at me. You see me.

35:15.545 --> 35:16.876
Look at me!

35:26.923 --> 35:30.086
Come on, Lee.
Take out the son of a bitch.

35:33.563 --> 35:36.862
How about it, Tom?
You still have a death wish?

35:37.467 --> 35:41.028
You ready to leave this world,
right here, right now?

35:41.904 --> 35:43.963
Yes.
Too bad.

35:45.274 --> 35:47.265
'Cause this is
what you're gonna do.

35:47.343 --> 35:50.642
You're gonna tell your men to help
us get that water off the moon.

35:50.980 --> 35:53.073
They're gonna work
for their points.

35:53.149 --> 35:55.982
And they're gonna earn
their freedom. And then...

35:57.487 --> 35:58.476
then...

36:00.456 --> 36:02.481
you're gonna get
your elections.

36:06.062 --> 36:08.428
What?
'Cause you're right, Tom.

36:10.366 --> 36:14.826
You are right about democracy
and consent of the people.

36:16.039 --> 36:19.167
I believe in those things,
and we're gonna have them.

36:21.244 --> 36:23.041
And you can have them, too.

36:25.114 --> 36:28.572
Or you can have this bullet.
Your call.

36:29.819 --> 36:32.379
What are you doing, Lee?
Come on.

36:33.356 --> 36:35.381
How do I know your father...

36:36.292 --> 36:39.523
and the President
will honor your word?

36:40.496 --> 36:41.622
You don't.

36:42.832 --> 36:46.290
You let the rest of the hostages go,
we'll leave this ship in your hands.

36:46.369 --> 36:50.499
They try and come after you, you
can still have your last stand.

36:52.308 --> 36:55.937
It's your choice.
You reap what you sow.

36:59.816 --> 37:01.078
All right.

37:06.489 --> 37:07.956
Lower your weapons.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.959
Lower your weapons.

37:12.028 --> 37:14.189
Do what he says. Put them down.

37:14.764 --> 37:15.924
Back off.

37:24.607 --> 37:28.566
Cally, you're gonna be okay.
You just hang in there, you hear?

37:29.078 --> 37:30.306
Got you.

37:38.287 --> 37:40.448
Cease fire.

37:42.458 --> 37:43.288
Don't shoot.

37:43.359 --> 37:44.621
<i>All teams,
hold positions.</i>

37:46.195 --> 37:47.492
Frak.

37:51.467 --> 37:52.695
Thanks.

37:53.336 --> 37:54.860
I need a medic here.

37:59.675 --> 38:00.903
God.

38:04.046 --> 38:05.570
I don't believe this.

38:06.949 --> 38:08.883
It's unacceptable.
It's done.

38:09.118 --> 38:11.712
<i>Prisoners have full control
of the Astral Queen.</i>

38:11.788 --> 38:15.349
We evac'ed all the guards and
support personnel. It's their ship.

38:15.558 --> 38:19.619
They're a threat to the entire
fleet. They've been disarmed.

38:20.496 --> 38:23.897
The ship itself has no weapons.
The ship itself is a weapon.

38:24.767 --> 38:27.463
They're totally dependent
on us for food, fuel...

38:27.537 --> 38:31.303
and they've agreed to organize the
workforce for the water detail on the moon.

38:31.374 --> 38:34.070
You've committed me to holding
elections within a year.

38:34.143 --> 38:36.168
Madam President,
with respect...

38:37.480 --> 38:40.779
you're serving out the remainder
of President Adar's term.

38:41.450 --> 38:45.352
When that term is up in seven months,
the law says there's an election.

38:46.088 --> 38:47.953
I only committed you
to obeying the law.

38:48.024 --> 38:50.458
You were not authorized...
You sound like a lawyer.

38:50.526 --> 38:52.892
I swore an oath
to defend the articles.

38:53.362 --> 38:55.796
The articles say there's
an election in seven months.

38:55.865 --> 38:57.924
If you're telling me,
we're throwing out the law...

38:58.000 --> 39:00.764
then I'm not a captain,
you're not a commander...

39:00.837 --> 39:02.771
and you are not the president.

39:02.872 --> 39:06.399
And I don't owe either of you a
damned explanation for anything.

39:11.113 --> 39:12.546
He's your son.

39:13.816 --> 39:15.306
He's your advisor.

39:16.619 --> 39:17.984
An election.

39:22.892 --> 39:25.156
I guess you
finally picked your side.

39:27.496 --> 39:28.929
Madam President.

39:58.861 --> 40:00.761
What the hell is this? Water?

40:01.097 --> 40:04.157
Bet your ass. There's plenty
more where that came from.

40:08.838 --> 40:10.465
I have my flaws, too.

40:12.041 --> 40:15.602
The difference is, my flaws are
personal, yours are professional.

40:20.049 --> 40:22.347
Thank you, Lieutenant.
That'll be all.

40:34.730 --> 40:37.927
Specialist Lazy, how are
you feeling? Must be nice...

40:38.000 --> 40:40.127
lying around, doing nothing,
as usual.

40:40.202 --> 40:42.932
Sorry, Chief. I didn't
think you'd find me here.

40:43.406 --> 40:46.637
I am so on to you.
Cally, is it true?

40:47.376 --> 40:48.900
You really bite
that guy's ear off?

40:49.045 --> 40:50.842
He's lucky
that's all I bit off.

40:54.183 --> 40:55.480
That's my girl.

41:05.061 --> 41:08.827
I'm sorry, I can come back.
No, it's all right. Come on in.

41:11.901 --> 41:15.268
<i>I just wanted to say goodbye
before I head back to Galactica.</i>

41:15.671 --> 41:17.332
And to tell you...

41:17.840 --> 41:21.298
I hope you understand, I wasn't
being disloyal, Madam President.

41:21.377 --> 41:25.108
I understand. You're
upholding the law. I admire it.

41:26.282 --> 41:29.012
I believe in you.
In what you're doing.

41:29.752 --> 41:33.449
And for what it's worth, seven
months from now, you'll have my vote.

41:36.993 --> 41:38.483
Could you sit?

41:49.505 --> 41:51.769
There's something
I need to tell you.

41:53.242 --> 41:56.075
The truth is, I might not
be here in seven months.

41:56.545 --> 41:59.139
Are you planning a vacation?
I wish.

42:03.552 --> 42:05.452
I told your father that I...

42:06.922 --> 42:08.981
had allergies,
but I have cancer.

42:10.226 --> 42:12.524
I found out
the morning of the attack.

42:16.399 --> 42:18.333
I'm so sorry, Madam President.

42:19.535 --> 42:22.800
I don't know what to say.
I understand.

42:23.506 --> 42:26.998
I'm going to fight this, but
there is a great need for secrecy.

42:27.076 --> 42:28.202
Of course.

42:30.780 --> 42:32.907
Whether or not
I survive this illness...

42:32.982 --> 42:37.612
it is of great importance to me
that there's a future for the people.

42:38.154 --> 42:41.988
And I fear that knowledge
of my illness will erode hope.

42:43.759 --> 42:46.125
So this has to stay
between you and me.

42:48.798 --> 42:52.757
You can count on me.
I know I can.

42:55.638 --> 42:57.230
You're Capt. Apollo.
