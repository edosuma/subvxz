Hey, Ace!

00:48.682 --> 00:50.482
Come here boy.

00:50.484 --> 00:51.750
Good boy.

Hey, Mom! Molly!

[Molly] Hey! Ooh!

00:57.258 --> 00:58.457
[Tim] What's up squirt?

00:58.459 --> 01:00.392
Squirt?
I'm almost as tall as you.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.326
Whatever.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.294
Hi, honey.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.729
Hey, Mom. How are you?

01:03.731 --> 01:04.630
I'm so good to see you.

01:04.632 --> 01:07.099
Good to see you, too.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.367
What's that I smell?

01:09.703 --> 01:12.137
Mom, please tell me that's
your lasagna in the kitchen.

01:12.139 --> 01:13.172
[Molly clears her throat]

01:13.174 --> 01:14.306
That is my lasagna

01:14.308 --> 01:15.441
you smell in the kitchen.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.776
I learned to cook
while you were away.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.611
So, we got a backup plan
for dinner, right?

Shut up!

01:22.183 --> 01:24.383
Come on guys,
let's go get something to eat.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.554
Hey, remember
that time you lost Ace?

01:28.556 --> 01:30.322
-The time that I lost Ace?
-Mm-hm.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.424
No, you lost Ace.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.326
Mom, she left
the front door wide open.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.761
I'm gonna get some more juice.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.229
Anybody need anything?

01:37.231 --> 01:38.864
Honey, can you get
some more water?

01:38.866 --> 01:40.432
We could all use
a lot more water.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.600
Okay, Mama.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.734
Thank you.

[Mrs. Goldman chuckles]

01:47.141 --> 01:48.707
So, how's school going?

01:48.709 --> 01:50.776
It's going good. Yeah.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.312
We are so proud of you, honey.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.746
-[Tim] Thanks, Mom.
-So proud.

01:56.317 --> 01:59.685
So, did you know that I made
the honor roll before?

01:59.687 --> 02:01.286
[Tim] No, I didn't.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.755
-Wait, you made the honor roll?
-[Mr. Goldman laughs]

02:03.757 --> 02:05.124
[Mrs. Goldman]
I don't remember that.

02:05.126 --> 02:06.492
[Tim] I'm not so sure
I believe that.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.459
[all laugh]

02:07.461 --> 02:09.661
That counts.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.263
I must admit
this lasagna is pretty good.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.532
Here we go.

02:13.534 --> 02:14.466
I'll take some of that.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.535
I got that. Okay.

02:16.537 --> 02:17.836
[both chuckle]

02:21.175 --> 02:22.774
So, the lasagna
is pretty good, huh?

02:22.776 --> 02:25.244
Not bad, not bad for a rookie.

02:25.246 --> 02:28.447
-[Mr. Goldman] Here you go, Tim.
-Thanks, Dad.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.449
Although you did learn
from the best.

02:30.451 --> 02:33.519
Of course. Of course.

02:33.521 --> 02:34.586
Here you go, Mom.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.355
-Thanks, honey.
-[Tim] Mm-Hm.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.359
Take another piece
of this bread.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.828
Since when did you start
eating so much?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.763
He learned it from you, dear.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.465
Yeah, but I work out.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.633
[all laugh]

02:47.635 --> 02:49.668
-Okay.
-[Mrs. Goldman] All right.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.471
But in all seriousness,
I wanna make a toast to Tim.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.273
It's great to have you home,
son.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.341

Tim, I'm glad you're here.

No, I don't know.

Maybe-- maybe it's the wine.

Anyway, I'm not feeling good.

to you later, okay?

Okay.

a small fortune from me

I was a drug smuggler,

the question.

Oh, I told you last night,
honey, I had a headache.

09:55.696 --> 09:58.597
I'm not that flexible.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.932
No, about the alarm.

And, yes, you are that flexible.

10:03.937 --> 10:04.970
[chuckles]

10:04.972 --> 10:06.605
That's why I married you.

Oh!

10:07.708 --> 10:08.807
And I thought you married me

Oh, and the alarm clock?

10:13.814 --> 10:16.314
Honey, you really need
to start remembering things.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.684
I can't believe
you don't remember

10:19.686 --> 10:21.620
today's
your co-worker's funeral.

10:23.390 --> 10:26.091
And you asked me
to set the alarm clock early.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.792
[Philip] Shit! That's today?

10:29.863 --> 10:31.029
I don't remember asking you

10:31.031 --> 10:33.164
to set the alarm clock
last night.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.299
You didn't.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.801
You asked me
to set it last week.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.403
Yeah, that's today.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.905
[Philip] Why did I agree
to attend this funeral?

10:41.775 --> 10:43.908
I didn't even
really know the guy. I mean...

10:45.145 --> 10:48.213
We said hello in the hospital,

10:48.215 --> 10:49.948
sometimes goodbye.

10:50.817 --> 10:54.252
But I didn't really,
like, know the guy.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.121
Well, I don't think
there's a choice

10:56.123 --> 10:58.823
if we go or not to funerals.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.359
I mean, when one
of your co-workers dies

11:01.361 --> 11:03.194
and someone else
from your office tells you

11:03.196 --> 11:04.996
where the funeral is,

11:04.998 --> 11:06.965
you're expected to be there.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.702
Speaking of which, where is it?

11:12.072 --> 11:13.838

The secret money stash?

11:13.840 --> 11:14.773
The funeral.

11:14.775 --> 11:15.674
I'm sure I asked you

11:15.676 --> 11:17.175
to remember that, too.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.944
[Charlotte] Yeah.
Are you really?

11:19.946 --> 11:20.845
Really what?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.147
Sure you asked?

11:23.684 --> 11:25.383
No.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.685
I like those.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.573
We're going
to the parks in Florida.

14:35.575 --> 14:38.376
So, what did you wanna
talk about?

14:38.378 --> 14:39.611
[sighs]

14:39.613 --> 14:41.412
Lewis was working on
something before he--

14:41.414 --> 14:42.981
[priest] ...all
that are grieving today...

14:42.983 --> 14:44.148
[Mrs. Barnes cries]

14:44.150 --> 14:47.285
[priest]
And flood their souls with hope,

14:47.287 --> 14:50.355
knowing that underneath
are your ever...

14:58.932 --> 15:00.298
Amen.

15:00.300 --> 15:04.569
So, he was trying to decipher
a piece of work,

15:04.571 --> 15:07.438
a diary written
by one of our patients.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.641
You know, the Goldman girl.

15:09.643 --> 15:11.242
Yeah, killed her family.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.477
Yeah.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.445
She poisoned her family, right?

15:14.447 --> 15:17.315
I guess she got tired of waiting

15:17.317 --> 15:18.683
because in the middle
of the night,

15:18.685 --> 15:21.419
she got up
and hacked them to death.

15:22.289 --> 15:25.089
Tried to kill herself
with the same shit.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.491
Failed.

15:26.493 --> 15:27.592
Damn.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.526
[sighs]

15:28.528 --> 15:29.994
She came in complaining

15:29.996 --> 15:32.263
about nightmares, remember?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.265
Yeah, so?

15:34.267 --> 15:38.503
She said she was tired
of falling asleep

15:38.505 --> 15:41.406
because the--
the nightmares were so bad.

15:41.408 --> 15:45.476
Every morning we'd go in,
and she'd tell us details

15:45.478 --> 15:47.412
about her latest nightmare.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.649
Her arms were bruised up
and shit.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.321
Scratches that she said
she must have done in her sleep.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.958
We watched the tapes.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.194
That girl never went to sleep.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.299
She was awake the entire time,

16:08.301 --> 16:10.702
just staring off into space

16:10.704 --> 16:12.437
and then attacking herself.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.705
[exhales]

16:14.607 --> 16:16.140
I'm serious.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.142
Okay.
So, what was Lewis working on?

16:18.144 --> 16:19.210
[sighs]

16:19.212 --> 16:22.981
The girl kept claiming

16:22.983 --> 16:26.284
that her killing her parents
was part of a dream.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.988
She demanded to see them.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.090
So, of course,
we determined she's crazy.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.392
We can't say that
about our patients.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.032
The point is
all that shit isn't the...

16:41.768 --> 16:44.402
most mentally unstable part.

16:47.307 --> 16:50.541
The girl kept a diary

16:50.543 --> 16:52.343
that-- that was...

16:54.581 --> 16:56.447
-Crazy?
-[Jeffrey sighs]

16:56.449 --> 16:58.750
The girl kept a diary

16:58.752 --> 17:02.253
of her offing her family.

17:03.289 --> 17:04.522
Uh--

17:04.524 --> 17:06.591
This-- this diary
wasn't any Anne Frank,

17:06.593 --> 17:08.393
"Help me, I'm in the Attic"
shit either.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.129
You can't say that either.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.797
[Jeffrey] I'm Jewish.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.232
I am allowed to say that.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.700
You're just not allowed
to laugh at it.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.703
Continue.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.705
Point is Lewis
was trying to figure out

17:20.707 --> 17:23.241
what the hell
the girl was writing about.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.676
We really need that report

17:25.678 --> 17:28.179
that he was doing about it
finished.

17:28.181 --> 17:31.149
I can't finish Lewis's thoughts.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.317
Besides, why don't you just
ask the girl?

17:33.319 --> 17:35.386
[exhales]

17:35.388 --> 17:36.454
She's dead.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.590
Suicide.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.192
Strangled herself.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.195
That's not possible.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.697
Try telling her that.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.835
I really appreciate this,
Philip.

17:50.837 --> 17:54.839
I would do it myself,
but, like I said, vacation.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.741
Uh, I wouldn't want to let down
my wife and kids.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.210
They have been begging for this
for the past two years.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.512
-That would be a shame.
-[Jeffrey chuckles]

18:01.514 --> 18:03.714
I don't know what I would do
if she left me. I mean...

18:03.716 --> 18:05.149
[laughs]

18:05.151 --> 18:06.217
Who would want me?

18:06.219 --> 18:09.654
Right, all right.

18:09.656 --> 18:12.557
Honey, here are your keys.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.825
[chuckles]

18:13.827 --> 18:15.393
It was really good
to see you, Philip.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.294
You too.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.462
And you, too, Charlotte.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.663
You too.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.732
Take care.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.539
Lewis' notes
and the girl Molly's diary

18:28.541 --> 18:30.575
will be in your office
in the morning.

18:30.577 --> 18:31.876
Thanks again.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.377
Don't worry about it.

18:33.379 --> 18:34.745
Have fun with the Mouse
in the parks.

18:34.747 --> 18:35.613
[chuckles]

18:35.615 --> 18:36.481
I will.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.349
By the way,

18:38.351 --> 18:39.684
what did Lewis die of?

18:41.454 --> 18:43.187
[Jeffrey] Suicide.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.523
[thunder rumbles]

18:45.525 --> 18:49.727
[mysterious music plays]

18:52.765 --> 18:54.265
[Philip] <i> Dr. Philip Tanner.</i>

19:06.779 --> 19:09.413
Molly Marie Goldman,

19:09.415 --> 19:12.216
aged 15, deceased.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.520
It is the belief
of my fellow doctors

19:15.522 --> 19:16.754
that this patient suffered

19:16.756 --> 19:18.890
from night terrors
and nightmares

19:18.892 --> 19:21.325
that she began
to mistake for reality.

19:21.327 --> 19:25.396
These dreams seem to eventually
set her on a course of insomnia,

19:25.398 --> 19:27.198
over a course
of a couple of weeks.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.501
And without sleep, Molly's mind
began to deteriorate.

19:31.771 --> 19:36.240
Molly Marie Goldman
was found lying naked

19:36.242 --> 19:38.643
atop her older brother's body,

19:38.645 --> 19:41.345
who she had just murdered,

19:41.347 --> 19:44.348
along with her family,

19:44.350 --> 19:47.185
parents, and the family dog.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.886
The young girl
tried unsuccessfully

19:48.888 --> 19:50.588
to poison herself,

19:50.590 --> 19:54.225
was determined
to be insane by a judge

19:54.227 --> 19:56.327
and sent
to the John B. Watson Center

19:56.329 --> 19:57.762
for psychiatric evaluation,

19:57.764 --> 19:59.330
<i> where she was treated</i>
<i> for two years</i>

19:59.332 --> 20:00.631
<i> before committing suicide.</i>

20:02.735 --> 20:04.936
I read the patient's diary,

20:04.938 --> 20:07.438
much to my dismay,

20:07.440 --> 20:08.573
because while it starts out

20:08.575 --> 20:11.242
as a young girl's view
on her life,

20:13.546 --> 20:15.980
it begins to lose focus
mid-sentence

20:15.982 --> 20:18.416
about a week
before she committed her crimes.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.786
The book begins to weave
a string of stories

20:21.788 --> 20:24.789
I can only assume she created
out of her own mind.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.694
Going on boating rides
with angels,

20:29.696 --> 20:32.463
swimming in clouds,
and so forth.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.466
It continues to move in
and out of these stories,

20:35.468 --> 20:39.270
are seemingly connected
or a continuation of each other

20:39.272 --> 20:41.639
and then from there goes
into great deal

20:41.641 --> 20:43.641
about the proper way
to sew a dress

20:43.643 --> 20:46.377
and cooking recipes, wh--

21:08.268 --> 21:09.033
Hello?

21:09.035 --> 21:10.034
[scrape]

21:10.036 --> 21:13.504
[scrape echoes]

21:16.276 --> 21:19.377
[door creaks]

21:22.749 --> 21:24.048
[sighs]

21:35.728 --> 21:37.928
Previous research
has resulted in theories

21:37.930 --> 21:40.965
that dreams are created
during REM sleep.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.433
Brain cells activated

21:42.435 --> 21:44.902
that normally control
eye movement,

21:44.904 --> 21:46.937
balance, and motor functions.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.973
However, in the case
of this patient,

21:48.975 --> 21:52.576
it appears these brain centers
activated while she was awake

21:52.578 --> 21:54.412
causing hallucination,

21:54.414 --> 21:56.914
panic, and frightening daydreams

21:56.916 --> 21:59.383
that she had no recollection of.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.889
Molly seemingly lost the ability
to tell when she was dreaming

22:04.891 --> 22:06.090
while she was awake

22:06.092 --> 22:07.558
and perceived her life

22:07.560 --> 22:10.428
to be much different
than it actually was.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.997
For one...

22:12.999 --> 22:14.932
[exhales]

22:14.934 --> 22:16.567
...near the end of her diary,

22:16.569 --> 22:20.071
Molly alludes
to several sexual encounters

22:20.073 --> 22:22.073
with her older brother

22:22.075 --> 22:25.710
with specific
and vivid description.

22:25.712 --> 22:28.713
However, a physical examination

22:28.715 --> 22:32.650
gave no clear indication
of sexual trauma.

22:32.652 --> 22:35.052
Molly's psychiatrist
could not convince her

22:35.054 --> 22:37.488
that the difference
between her reality

22:37.490 --> 22:39.123
and her dreams.

so late, Dr. Tanner?

24:08.648 --> 24:10.581

24:13.920 --> 24:16.020
Shit, you look tired.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.087
Did I frighten you?

24:18.191 --> 24:19.657
Yeah, tired.

24:19.659 --> 24:20.691
[chuckles]

24:24.630 --> 24:26.497
-And frightened.
-[janitor chuckles]

24:26.499 --> 24:28.732
I wasn't expecting anybody
besides the security guards

24:28.734 --> 24:30.501
to be here so late.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.674
Did you walk past my office
a few minutes ago?

24:38.144 --> 24:39.210
No.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.513
Are you okay, Doc?

24:46.219 --> 24:47.785
Yeah.

24:49.856 --> 24:52.022
Can we get somebody
to fix these lights?

24:52.024 --> 24:53.691
Yeah, no problem.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.227
[Philip] Goodnight.

Goodnight.

[crickets chirping]

25:07.507 --> 25:08.806
Good stuff?

25:09.642 --> 25:11.809
To truly be an intellectual,

25:11.811 --> 25:14.845
you must first
understand the people.

25:16.516 --> 25:18.649
What are you reading?

25:18.651 --> 25:21.218
A teenage girl's diary.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.721
Oh, so you do have
another family out there.

25:23.723 --> 25:24.889
[both chuckle]

25:24.891 --> 25:26.924
Yes.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.827
But this is not
from one of them.

25:29.829 --> 25:32.796
This is from a former patient,
now deceased.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.634
How's Grace?

25:36.636 --> 25:38.135
Grace is good,

25:38.137 --> 25:39.937
although I feel
like she's spending

25:39.939 --> 25:42.740
way too much time
watching Cindy.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.175
I think she's trying
to avoid the dating scene.

25:45.177 --> 25:47.811
So stop asking her to babysit.

25:47.813 --> 25:49.713
She just volunteers.

25:49.715 --> 25:53.551
She's always asking if we have
plans, do we need a sitter?

25:53.553 --> 25:55.853
I'm not a very convincing liar.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.290
Well, I can't seem
to fool anyone, but you.

26:00.293 --> 26:02.793
Why are you reading
an old patient's diary?

26:03.663 --> 26:06.764
Sometimes we like to go through
old files and documentation.

26:06.766 --> 26:10.000
Get a good idea of the state
of mind and mental disposition

26:10.002 --> 26:12.336
of some of our patients.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.572
That way when
and if anyone else comes in

26:14.574 --> 26:16.206
presenting the same issues,

26:16.208 --> 26:18.342
we have a reference point.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.210
I thought you approached
all your patients

26:20.212 --> 26:22.813
like individuals.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.965
We do.

26:24.966 --> 26:27.116
But we do have proven techniques
that we use over and over again.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.021
All cats are not the same,

26:31.023 --> 26:33.324
yet we still try
to give them milk.

26:33.326 --> 26:35.192
What?

26:35.194 --> 26:36.594
[chuckles]

26:36.596 --> 26:37.861
Nothing.

26:37.863 --> 26:39.964
Just trying to create
my own motto,

26:39.966 --> 26:42.132
something to be remembered by.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.701
Or hated for.

26:46.672 --> 26:48.072
There is something
on the first page

26:48.074 --> 26:49.974
I wanted to ask you about.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.141
Shoot!

26:54.914 --> 26:56.180
"Warning.

26:56.182 --> 26:59.984
This diary belongs
to Molly Marie Goldman.

26:59.986 --> 27:01.652
All contents are secret

27:01.654 --> 27:04.822
and not to be read
by anyone ever.

27:04.824 --> 27:06.857
Consider this your final warning

27:06.859 --> 27:08.225
for whomever read--"

27:09.962 --> 27:12.262
Is that proper context?

27:12.264 --> 27:14.765
What? "Whomever"?

27:14.767 --> 27:16.166
I think so.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.802
Whomever...

27:18.804 --> 27:20.070
whoever.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.339
Mm-hmm, yeah.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.376
Anyway...

27:25.378 --> 27:29.413
"...for whomever reads this
will be forever cursed."

27:31.283 --> 27:33.751
And then she just stops.

27:33.753 --> 27:37.354
Jots down, "I'll be right back"
and never finishes the curse.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.257
It doesn't sound
like a question.

27:42.194 --> 27:45.129
Do all girls
curse their diaries?

27:45.131 --> 27:48.098
Only the ones
who are secretly witches.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.401
I don't know, honey.
I didn't keep a diary.

27:50.403 --> 27:53.270
I thought
all women kept diaries.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.105
Only the ones that need someone

27:55.107 --> 27:57.941
to bounce their thoughts
and ideas off of.

27:57.943 --> 27:59.109
I never needed that.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.078
I had a teddy bear

28:01.080 --> 28:03.714
and a fully thought-out plan.

28:03.716 --> 28:04.982
A plan?

28:04.984 --> 28:07.885
Yes, marry a doctor,
have a daughter.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.454
Seriously?

28:10.456 --> 28:13.123
Yeah, marry a doctor,
have a daughter.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.792
It's about as far
as I thought it out,

28:14.794 --> 28:17.695
but so far,
it's worked out pretty nicely.

28:18.831 --> 28:21.065
No, seriously?

28:21.067 --> 28:22.299
[chuckles]

28:22.301 --> 28:26.470
Women can plan
what kind of child we have.

28:26.472 --> 28:30.841
If you want a son,
and we give you a daughter,

28:30.843 --> 28:32.843
it's because we don't like you
very much.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.981
What else does
this patient have to say?

28:39.385 --> 28:42.419
Well, she goes into great detail

28:42.421 --> 28:45.456
about the proper technique
to sew a dress,

28:45.458 --> 28:48.492
and I mean great detail.

28:49.762 --> 28:51.095
I can say after reading this

28:51.097 --> 28:53.330
that we'll never have to buy
Cindy clothes again.

28:53.332 --> 28:55.365
Just bring me a bolt of fabric.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.001
And there's other entries

28:58.003 --> 29:00.037
about the size
of her brother's penis--

29:00.039 --> 29:01.905
Whoa!

29:01.907 --> 29:05.042
Too much information there,
Tiger.

29:05.044 --> 29:08.078
I thought you wanted to know
what I was working on.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.446
Goodnight, Philip.

29:09.448 --> 29:13.050
I have to work tomorrow,
early and I'm sleepy.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.787
-No sex?
-[Charlotte] No.

29:16.789 --> 29:18.522
I was gonna give you
a little southern kissing,

29:18.524 --> 29:20.758
but I lost my mood.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.263
Okay.

29:27.466 --> 29:28.899
Goodnight, Charlotte.

29:31.403 --> 29:33.370

33:30.609 --> 33:33.343
Sorry, I...

33:33.345 --> 33:34.578
had a nightmare.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.414
Mm, do tell, doctor,
this sounds good.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.150
It's not funny, Charlotte.

It's not funny. It was so...

real.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.090
Actually, it is funny.

Honey, aren't you the one
that always tells patients

33:49.161 --> 33:50.327
that dreams and nightmares--

33:50.329 --> 33:51.762
Are only clues
into what troubles us

33:51.764 --> 33:53.196
in our conscious state.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.765
I know,
and they still are, but--

33:56.502 --> 33:58.602
Charlotte,
I dreamt Cindy was gone

33:58.604 --> 34:00.203
and you were dead.

34:01.106 --> 34:03.607
Oh, honey. It's okay.

34:03.609 --> 34:05.675
I've had that same dream.

34:05.677 --> 34:09.212

What's wrong?

34:35.207 --> 34:36.339
Two things.

34:36.341 --> 34:38.341
One, the toilet seat

34:38.343 --> 34:40.243
is never left up
by our daughter.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.745
I almost blamed her
for this mess

34:41.747 --> 34:43.180
and then I noticed
the seat's up,

34:43.182 --> 34:45.282
and I immediately
thought of you.

34:45.284 --> 34:48.285
And the pool boy who comes by
while you're at work.

34:48.287 --> 34:50.787
-Mess?
-The towels, Philip.

34:52.157 --> 34:53.623
[Philip chuckles]

34:53.625 --> 34:55.092
-I--
-You know what, Philip?

34:55.094 --> 34:58.462
We have our own bathroom.
It's in our bedroom.

34:58.464 --> 35:01.098
You mess that one up,
I will happily do the cleaning.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.200
I get a little angry
when you come in

35:03.202 --> 35:05.268
and take your wrath out
on our daughter's bathroom.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.237
I must have been sleepwalking
a bit.

35:07.239 --> 35:08.371
I'll pick it up.

35:08.373 --> 35:11.541
No, I got it. You know how I am.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.643
First of all, these are
gonna need to be washed.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.679
They were on the bathroom floor,
for God's sake.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.814
It's not a public restroom.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.550
All the same, Philip.
It's all the same.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.620
You know, I thought I cured you
of being a neat freak,

35:23.622 --> 35:26.323
all those hours on my couch.

35:26.325 --> 35:29.359
No, you cured me
of my virginity on that couch.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.428
I only pretended
not to have so many problems

35:31.430 --> 35:33.230
so I could marry
into your money.

35:33.232 --> 35:34.197
[chuckles]

35:35.634 --> 35:37.200
Is Cindy still asleep?

35:37.202 --> 35:38.435
Actually, no.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.303
Grace came
and picked her up early.

35:42.474 --> 35:43.607
[Philip] When?

35:45.277 --> 35:47.277
She didn't wanna say goodbye?

35:47.279 --> 35:48.245
She did.

35:48.247 --> 35:49.813
She also said she loves me.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.248
She didn't mention you, though.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.151

and the zoo.

our priorities straight.

you were dead asleep,

36:09.401 --> 36:10.734
and I know you love your sleep.

36:10.736 --> 36:13.637
I also know you have
a busy day at the office

36:13.639 --> 36:15.672
and you need your rest.

she would have started
screaming.

42:00.334 --> 42:02.518
She's afraid of heights.
That would have woke me up.

42:02.521 --> 42:06.022
It would have woken you up,
maybe.

42:06.024 --> 42:09.192
Maybe you didn't even
climb out the window.

42:10.228 --> 42:12.862
Maybe you simply walked outside

42:12.864 --> 42:14.797
and tripped over the grill.

42:14.799 --> 42:17.934
You have no proof that the whole
climbing on the roof thing

42:17.936 --> 42:19.769
<i> was even real.</i>

42:19.771 --> 42:21.004
Real?

42:22.841 --> 42:25.108
Jeffrey, the nightmare seemed--

42:25.110 --> 42:29.012
You were sleepwalking, Philip.

42:29.014 --> 42:30.580
How much sleep have you gotten

42:30.582 --> 42:31.548
<i> since I asked you</i>

42:31.550 --> 42:34.817
to work on Lewis's research?

42:35.687 --> 42:37.020
Not much.

42:37.022 --> 42:39.322
[Jeffrey] <i> Well, then get</i>
<i> some sleep, Philip.</i>

42:40.292 --> 42:43.259
I won't be back
for a few more days.

42:43.261 --> 42:45.595
There's no rush to finish
the goddamn thing.

42:46.264 --> 42:47.664

42:47.666 --> 42:49.232
Christ, you're gonna
end up like Lewis.

42:50.735 --> 42:51.801
<i> I'll call you.</i>

42:51.803 --> 42:54.771
Jeffrey, what happened to Lewis?

42:54.773 --> 42:56.639
I told you.

42:56.641 --> 42:58.141
Suicide.

42:58.143 --> 42:59.642
<i> I gotta go, Philip.</i>

42:59.644 --> 43:01.711
Jeffrey, what happened to Lewis?

43:04.182 --> 43:06.649
What happened to Lewis?

43:06.651 --> 43:07.917
[exhales]

43:09.220 --> 43:11.955
He shot himself
in the chest, Philip.

43:13.692 --> 43:16.993
He didn't climb up on the roof
and fall on a grill

43:16.995 --> 43:18.728
or anything like that.

43:19.965 --> 43:20.930
[exhales]

43:20.932 --> 43:22.365
He lived in a shitty house

43:22.367 --> 43:23.633
with a wife.

43:23.635 --> 43:24.701
You know, with the blond one

43:24.703 --> 43:26.235
who was crying at the funeral.

43:26.237 --> 43:29.138
Yeah, a wife
who was cheating on him

43:29.140 --> 43:31.007
with whoever
could get a hard-on.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.110
That's why.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.311
That's it.

43:36.147 --> 43:38.081
That doesn't make sense.

43:38.083 --> 43:40.650
[Jeffrey] <i> You were</i>
<i> sleepwalking. That's all.</i>

43:40.652 --> 43:42.685
It's very common.

43:44.623 --> 43:45.388
You know what?

43:45.390 --> 43:47.790
Ask your wife to watch you

43:47.792 --> 43:49.158
while you sleep tonight.

43:51.062 --> 43:52.695
I'll--

43:52.697 --> 43:54.764
I'll call you when I get back.

44:08.680 --> 44:09.879

I'm fine. Why?

44:30.101 --> 44:31.968
Honey, you're soaked,
that's why.

44:31.970 --> 44:34.303

Sorry, I went out to check
on the wires, got wet.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.080
After we hung up,
the power went off, so--

44:44.082 --> 44:46.382
Philip, hung up? We didn't talk.

44:48.253 --> 44:49.385
Right.

44:51.056 --> 44:53.222
I went out to check
on the wires and I got wet.

I've got a lot of work to do.

45:06.771 --> 45:07.970
Can you order a pizza?

45:07.972 --> 45:10.139
I never got a chance
to start dinner.

45:12.844 --> 45:15.044
Philip, are you sure
you're okay?

45:16.314 --> 45:17.880

45:50.348 --> 45:51.948
I don't care.

45:56.020 --> 45:59.055
Okay, I guess I can go
clean up the water

45:59.057 --> 46:00.389
and the mess that you made

46:00.391 --> 46:02.358
and figure out what kind
of pizza to order for us.

46:02.360 --> 46:04.260

The only way to try

55:41.639 --> 55:42.805
and regain a hold of it

55:42.807 --> 55:44.840
was to try and immerse yourself

1:13:10.019 --> 1:13:11.386
we can get drunk

1:13:11.388 --> 1:13:13.020
and tell stupid stories

1:13:13.022 --> 1:13:14.789
about Charlotte and Philip.

1:13:59.769 --> 1:14:01.035
If you need to talk...

1:14:01.037 --> 1:14:03.471
Hey, hey, I'm the doctor,

1:14:03.473 --> 1:14:05.540
you're supposed to come to me
with your problems.

1:14:07.076 --> 1:14:08.543
I'm all right. Thanks.

1:14:08.545 --> 1:14:11.212
Okay. Have a nice day.

1:14:11.214 --> 1:14:13.014
[Jeffrey] Uh, wait.

1:14:13.016 --> 1:14:14.682
-Yes?
-[Jeffrey] What's that?

1:14:14.684 --> 1:14:17.018
Oh, yeah. I was gonna ask you.

1:14:17.020 --> 1:14:19.487
I was just about to put
these in storage.

1:14:19.489 --> 1:14:20.721
What is it?

1:14:21.558 --> 1:14:23.891
Mr.--

1:14:23.893 --> 1:14:25.860
[clears his throat]

1:14:25.862 --> 1:14:28.463
Mr. Tanner's things.
Some of his files.

1:14:28.465 --> 1:14:29.931
Looks like something
he was working on.

1:14:29.933 --> 1:14:32.066
Um...

1:14:32.068 --> 1:14:33.701
Okay, uh...

1:14:33.703 --> 1:14:35.203
Yeah, go ahead
and put them in storage

1:14:35.205 --> 1:14:37.572
and, uh, just label them.

1:14:37.574 --> 1:14:38.773
I'll go through them later.

1:14:42.111 --> 1:14:44.779
Oh, um...

1:14:44.781 --> 1:14:46.581
I don't think
this belongs to him.

1:14:46.583 --> 1:14:47.882
Some kind of diary.

1:14:47.884 --> 1:14:49.851
Him being a man and all,
I figured him--

1:14:49.853 --> 1:14:52.653
Damn, that fucking diary.

1:14:54.123 --> 1:14:55.790
[sighs]

1:14:55.792 --> 1:14:56.791
I'll take it.

1:14:56.793 --> 1:14:58.125
It was a patient's.

1:14:59.729 --> 1:15:01.929
I still have to finish
a report on it.

1:15:05.101 --> 1:15:06.167
All right.

1:15:14.010 --> 1:15:15.943
[sighs]

1:15:21.050 --> 1:15:26.921
Finish
this psychiatric guideline

1:15:29.225 --> 1:15:34.195
or do a simple report

1:15:34.197 --> 1:15:36.063
on a girl's diary?

1:15:36.065 --> 1:15:38.032
[chuckles]

1:15:38.034 --> 1:15:38.900
Tsk.

1:15:38.902 --> 1:15:40.067
It's a simple job,

1:15:40.069 --> 1:15:42.003
but somebody's got to do it.

1:15:45.308 --> 1:15:48.709
"For whomever reads this
will be forever cursed."

1:15:48.711 --> 1:15:50.011
[chuckles]

1:15:50.013 --> 1:15:52.113
[thunder rumbles]

1:15:53.950 --> 1:15:57.118
Hmm, looks like rain.

1:15:59.722 --> 1:16:04.158
[tense music plays]
