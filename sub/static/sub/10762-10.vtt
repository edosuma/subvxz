<b>F R A S I E R (10x10)
- <i>We Two Kings</i> -

00:08.800 --> 00:13.100
- Oh, hey Roz. Can I join you?
- Sure.
- May I have a latte to go, please?

00:13.300 --> 00:16.400
And I... I hope that they're paying 
you extra to wear that. 
- No.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.400
- But I was hoping that it would 
help me with my tips.
- Ah. Well, as you know,

00:19.550 --> 00:23.250
my tipping policy stands firmly 
on the twin pillars of courtesy...

00:29.400 --> 00:31.800
God Bless You, sir.

00:34.250 --> 00:38.050
I'm really surprised. I didn't think 
you'd go for something so kitschy.

00:38.170 --> 00:41.370
It's Christmas time I say 
let a thousand antlers bloom.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Oh, well what a relief.

00:45.150 --> 00:49.150
- Oh... oh, Roz.
- I'm working Santa's Toy Drive 
at the mall. 

00:49.300 --> 00:52.300
- I'm an elf.
- Roz, if you needed extra cash 
you should have come to me.

00:52.450 --> 00:56.350
- I've got plenty of odd chores 
around the house.
- It's not about money.

00:56.500 --> 01:00.400
- I'm volunteering.
- Oh! Well, good for you, yes. 

01:00.700 --> 01:04.800
Yeah, visiting Santa Claus at the 
department store was one of my 
favorite memories as a kid.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.400
Mmmm... I always found him terrifying 
- and inquisitorial.

01:11.600 --> 01:16.200
When I was seven - my mom and dad 
took me to the mall to see Santa...

01:16.500 --> 01:20.900
They were going through their divorce 
at the time so they were barely talking.

01:21.100 --> 01:25.300
Anyway, when I sat down on his lap, 
I started to cry...

01:25.500 --> 01:28.200
and he was just so nice,

01:28.400 --> 01:31.200
he made me feel safe 
and protected...

01:31.350 --> 01:36.250
I don't know, he just made me feel 
special. So if I can do that for just 
one little kid - you know? - 

01:36.450 --> 01:40.050
- I'd like to do that.
- I'm sorry I laughed at you, Roz.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.200
- You should be very proud of yourself.
- Thank you.

01:43.400 --> 01:48.300
- and I better go before I'm late.
- Oh, right. I'm going too, 
I'll walk with you.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.000
Actually Roz,

01:55.600 --> 01:59.200
why don't you go ahead?? I'm going 
to get myself a scone.

02:03.700 --> 02:06.200
Oh, hi guys. Good to see you.
Come on in.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.600
Hey! Ah, we were hoping 
to uh, use your <i>wassail</i> bowl.

02:09.800 --> 02:14.500
Oh, I'm sorry. I've already loaned it 
to Lawrence Emerson and his 
mandrel-caroling group.

02:14.700 --> 02:18.100
Well you can kiss that bowl good-bye. 
Frasier...

02:18.250 --> 02:21.850
the Yule Tones are the bad boys 
of Renaissance Christmas music.

02:22.700 --> 02:26.400
Have you ever seen a church common 
room after one of their performances?

02:26.550 --> 02:30.150
- Why don't you just use the punch bowl?
- Because then it wouldn't be <i>wassail</i>, 
it would be punch.

02:30.350 --> 02:34.650
- What's the difference?
- Me dad used to say that punch would 
make you want to kiss the donkey 

02:34.770 --> 02:37.570
in the manger scene, and <i>wassail</i> 
makes you want to check into the inn.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.600
That's very funny. Uh, listen Daphne, uh, 
I was just wondering,

02:42.750 --> 02:46.450
is your mum partial to a traditional 
Cornwell dressing?

02:46.600 --> 02:51.600
You see, I'm thinking it'd go splendidly 
with the 12-lb. Hungarian goose 
that I'm serving.

02:51.800 --> 02:56.400
Mum is spending Christmas on a cruise, 
an early Christmas present from Niles.

02:56.550 --> 03:00.350
Yes, I didn't think she'd go for it, but 
apparently in international waters

03:00.470 --> 03:02.970
you can play single deck Black Jack.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.200
Actually Frasier, Daphne and I... 

03:06.350 --> 03:09.450
would like to have you over at 
OUR house for Christmas this year.

03:09.570 --> 03:12.370
Yeah, we just put up our tree 
and everything looks so lovely.

03:12.490 --> 03:15.090
and it is our first Christmas 
as a married couple.

03:15.220 --> 03:19.120
- Well, uh, as lovely as that sounds...
- Oh, come on, why not?!

03:19.800 --> 03:23.000
Uh, well, Niles, because it's a little 
late to be changing things, isn't it?

03:23.120 --> 03:27.120
- Besides, we've always had Christmas here, 
it's a tradition.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.200
- â€œWassail - a Christmas punch."

03:31.600 --> 03:34.800
Frasier, you've had Christmas 
for the past nine years.
- Yes, but we agreed that

03:34.920 --> 03:38.520
when you hosted Thanksgiving, that we 
would have Christmas here in its 
traditional setting.

03:38.650 --> 03:42.050
- Well maybe it's time to start 
a new tradition.
- But I've had new stockings...

03:42.170 --> 03:45.770
loomed for everyone - now there, you see,
you've made me spoil the surprise

03:45.900 --> 03:50.400
And did anyone hear that I have 
ordered a Hungarian goose?!

03:52.000 --> 03:57.600
- Which you are more than welcome 
to bring to our place.
- It's not my date, it's dinner!

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Honestly Niles, I'm really quite 
affronted by this.

04:03.600 --> 04:07.100
- If it means that much to him, why 
don't we just let him keep it?
- No, No!

04:07.220 --> 04:11.120
There is no reason why just this once 
we can't host Christmas at the Montana.

04:11.240 --> 04:15.140
- Frasier's just being a churl.
- You're the churl!
- You're both a couple of churls.

04:15.900 --> 04:20.000
How about a compromise?  Say... morning 
at one house, afternoon at the other.

04:20.149 --> 04:23.750
Well, that's a wonderful idea... but 
who gets morning and who gets afternoon?

04:23.870 --> 04:27.670
- Morning! Morning! 
- I think Niles said it first.

04:30.200 --> 04:34.000
- Dad, who do you think said it first?
- I'm sick of everything being a contest 
between the two of you. 

04:34.200 --> 04:38.800
- Alright then, dad, you decide 
where we're having Christmas.
- I'm fine with that.
- Alright... I will.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.600
I need a few days to think about it... 
In the meantime,

04:42.800 --> 04:46.100
decision-making is thirsty work, 
sure could use a beer.

04:46.220 --> 04:49.220
- Oh! I'll get it!
- NO!!
- I got it!
- Oh, will you shut up! 

04:50.900 --> 04:53.900
A little trick their mom 
taught me.

04:55.700 --> 04:58.700
Don't worry, Margie, 
you don't need a chimney.

04:58.850 --> 05:01.650
Santa always finds a way in.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
- You have a Merry Christmas now.
- Thank you, Santa. 

05:06.400 --> 05:08.900
- Roz! Hello.
- Oh! Hi, Frasier.

05:09.050 --> 05:12.450
Listen, when I'm at the North Pole 
my name is Snowflake.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.600
It's a little on the nose, isn't it?

05:15.800 --> 05:19.400
- I was at the mall and thought I'd drop
off a donation for the Toy Drive.
- Thank you very much. 

05:19.600 --> 05:24.700
- Is this for us too?
- No, no, actually this is another 
"Dancing Santa" for dad.

05:24.900 --> 05:28.600
- His other one got damaged.
- I thought you threw that thing 
over the balcony?

05:28.800 --> 05:31.200
Yes, which damaged it.

05:33.700 --> 05:38.100
- Polly, what would you like Santa 
to bring you?
- He wouldn't have to bring me anything.

05:38.250 --> 05:42.050
- Just show up.
- Back off Twinkle, I saw him first.

05:42.700 --> 05:47.600
What's this?? Do I sense a little office 
romance... here at Santa's Workshop?

05:47.900 --> 05:52.100
Oh, I wouldn't mind. His name is Rick,
and he's so... sweet.

05:52.300 --> 05:56.100
- And let me guess, he's also a hunk?
- I wouldn't know, I haven't seen him 
without his Santa getup yet. 

05:56.220 --> 06:00.220
But based on those eyes, 
there's definite potential.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.200
Santa needs his favorite helper elf.

06:05.350 --> 06:09.450
- Oh, see that, I'm his favorite.
- Down, Snowflake, I've got this one.

06:09.600 --> 06:13.600
Okay Twinkle, you go ahead.
Oh, no, is that a zit?

06:18.900 --> 06:21.200
Oh, Snowflake. Over here.

06:21.800 --> 06:26.000
Hi. I just got back from the costume 
shop, I had to get my toes re-curled.

06:26.150 --> 06:28.450
Ah, which reminds me.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.200
How are things with Mr. Claus, mm?

06:31.500 --> 06:34.600
- Oh, I haven't had a chance to ask him 
out yet.
- What's the matter?

06:34.750 --> 06:37.750
Low... elf-esteem?

06:39.200 --> 06:42.100
- How long have you been waiting 
to say that?

06:42.250 --> 06:44.650
Two days. I almost called you.

06:45.700 --> 06:49.700
What's this? Niles with dad. 
I knew it!

06:50.200 --> 06:54.700
- Oh! You guys aren't still fighting 
about Christmas?
- He's fighting. I'm not fighting.

06:54.900 --> 07:00.000
- Oh, what is the big deal? Why don't 
you let him have Christmas?
- Because it is just so unfair.

07:00.150 --> 07:03.550
- What's not fair?
- Oh, you wouldn't understand.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.950
Well, come on Frasier, 
talk to me.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.600
Use your words.

07:10.300 --> 07:13.100
Because, it's so egregious.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.600
Smaller words.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.800
I don't know.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.400
Okay, look, it just seems that Niles 
is systematically emptying my home.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.900
We used to have Thanksgiving dinner 
there... gone!  Daphne... 

07:28.100 --> 07:29.700
gone!

07:29.900 --> 07:32.700
If I let him have Christmas, 
I'll have nothing left.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.700
Just end up some...

07:34.850 --> 07:37.300
doddering old bachelor

07:37.450 --> 07:41.650
sipping tea and keeping the apartment 
at a balmy seventy-eight degrees.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.800
And how is that different from now?

07:48.100 --> 07:52.500
Excuse me. 
I smell skullduggery afoot.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.700
- Hey, dad. 
- Hey, Fras.
- New thermos?

07:57.900 --> 08:00.900
Niles, I'd have never thought 
you'd stoop so low. 

08:01.050 --> 08:04.650
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Just buying dad some coffee

08:04.800 --> 08:08.400
- ...before driving him to work.
- You are trying to bribe dad to have 
Christmas at your place!

08:08.550 --> 08:11.550
Oh, and what about you? 
Buying him the Dancing Santa.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.200
A surprising gift, considering you threw 
his last one off the balcony!

08:15.400 --> 08:19.500
You did what? That Santa never did 
anything to hurt you.

08:19.700 --> 08:23.700
All he ever did was dance and 
try to make people happy.

08:27.500 --> 08:31.600
- Why do you have to make everything 
so difficult?
- Sorry, Niles, but I have news for you.

08:31.750 --> 08:35.750
Copernicus called and you are not 
the center of the universe!

08:36.700 --> 08:41.000
- Alright, you two knock it off! 
- Let's just settle this now.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.600
Sit down. Dad, make your decision.

08:43.799 --> 08:47.600
You know, I'm really disappointed 
in you. I thought that if I gave you 
a little time,

08:47.720 --> 08:51.920
you'd be mature enough to work this 
out on your own.

08:52.700 --> 08:56.400
- Well you were wrong! 
- You know what? I just made my decision.
I'm working Christmas.

08:56.550 --> 08:59.850
Jimmy Daily asked me to take his shift 
and I'm gonna do it.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Because he'll be happier with his 
family than I am with mine.

09:03.150 --> 09:06.150
- Oh, dad, you can't be serious? 
- It's too late!

09:06.300 --> 09:09.100
And you don't have to drive me 
to work, I can call a cab.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.200
I hope you're happy! 
You've ruined Christmas!

09:17.700 --> 09:19.900
Not nice.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.100
Dad, uh, Niles and I would like 
to apologize.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.900
It was untoward of us to... 
to argue of where to have Christmas.

09:34.100 --> 09:38.100
Our conduct was... 
was self-absorbed and boorish.

09:38.500 --> 09:42.100
Not that we deserve it, 
but please accept our apologies.

09:43.200 --> 09:47.600
- Apologies accepted.
- Thank you, dad. So you'll have 
Christmas with us?

09:47.800 --> 09:51.200
I'm afraid I can't. I promised Jimmy 
that I'd work. I can't go back on it.

09:51.400 --> 09:55.500
- When do you start? 
- 6 a.m., twelve-hour shift. It's double 
time, so I'm not complaining.

09:55.650 --> 09:58.350
- No, that's the whole day.
- Marty...

09:58.500 --> 10:02.700
I need you to let maintenance into 
the electrical closet on seven.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.100
- Will do. See you boys later.
- Bye, dad.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.300
Christmas without dad...

10:15.600 --> 10:17.900
This just won't be... Christmas.

10:18.050 --> 10:22.850
I know. He's always the first one 
under the tree.

10:24.200 --> 10:28.400
Mom always said that he was the biggest 
kid. He could never wait to open his 
presents.

10:29.700 --> 10:34.000
He always puts on a brave face, but 
I know he especially misses mom 
on Christmas.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.900
Niles, where is it written

10:39.400 --> 10:42.400
that we have to have Christmas 
at either of our homes?? 

10:42.550 --> 10:46.250
- The Thanksgiving Accord of 2002.
- No, no. What I am saying...

10:46.400 --> 10:49.700
...is that dad has to work. Why can't 
we bring the holiday to him?? 

10:49.850 --> 10:52.950
You mean just show up 
and surprise him? I like that.

10:53.200 --> 10:57.600
- We can bring all our gifts and food.
- Oh, better yet. What if...

10:57.750 --> 11:00.550
...the gifts were already here?

11:00.750 --> 11:03.350
- But...
- Okay, here's what I'm thinking...

11:04.600 --> 11:09.000
We take the gifts that are here and 
put them under the tree at my house.

11:09.400 --> 11:14.600
Get the real gifts and bring them here, 
all unbeknownst to dad.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.900
- Brilliant! 
- Can't you just see us casually 
stopping by on Christmas morning?

11:19.100 --> 11:24.300
"Hello, dad. Merry Christmas, it's 
just a shame that you had to spend Chri..."

11:24.600 --> 11:28.500
"Hello? What's this I spy?"

11:29.300 --> 11:34.300
- "A present for Martin?"
-<i>"That's not for me, those are fake."</i>

11:35.300 --> 11:37.300
"Well, here's another one."

11:37.500 --> 11:42.300
"One for Niles. 
And one for Daphne."

11:42.500 --> 11:46.400
- <i>"Oh geez it's a miracle!"</i>
- Oh, Niles.  It'll be...

11:46.600 --> 11:50.100
- ...the best Christmas we've ever had!
- Look, I'm getting goose bumps!

11:50.220 --> 11:53.720
Oh no, Niles, that's your pine rash.
You're too close to the tree.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.400
Hey! Hi, Roz.

12:02.100 --> 12:07.100
- It, it's me, Rick.
- Oh my God, Rick, I didn't even 
recognize you.

12:07.300 --> 12:10.400
- Roz and I volunteer at the mall together.
- Rick plays Santa.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.900
- Daphne, this is Rick. Rick, Daphne.
- Oh, Roz has told me all about you.

12:13.100 --> 12:17.700
- Would you like to join us?
- I'd love to, but I have to get back 
to my day job.

12:17.900 --> 12:21.900
- Oh, what do you do?
- I'm an investment banker. Could you 
excuse me for just one second? 

12:22.600 --> 12:25.800
Wow, Roz! You never told me 
he was so gorgeous.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.800
- Oh, I've never seen him out 
of his costume before.
- He's successful and has great taste.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.100
Those shoes... 
<i>Enrico Zangleones.</i>

12:35.550 --> 12:37.850
Niles is teaching me.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.700
Itâ€™s very nice meeting you, Daphne. 
I'll see you tonight, Roz?

12:42.850 --> 12:46.750
Maybe we could take our break together. 
I stuck a bottle of schnapps in my locker.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Yeah, maybe.

12:49.300 --> 12:52.300
- Is something wrong? 
You don't like schnapps? 
- No!

12:52.500 --> 12:55.700
No, it's just so strange to see 
you without your beard.

12:55.900 --> 13:00.600
- You really should grow one. 
It would make your eyes twinkle.
- Eh, I tried once.

13:00.900 --> 13:05.600
Kinda came in... tough. I looked 
like a dog on Rogaine.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.700
What was that?

13:11.900 --> 13:14.800
- I... I laughed.
- That's your laugh?
- Yeah.

13:15.100 --> 13:18.700
- Wow, at the mall it's so booming.
- I... I know, I hate that.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.900
It really kills my throat.
Very nice to meet you.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.100
- Bye, Bye.
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

13:24.700 --> 13:28.700
- Why are you being so weird? He seems
perfect.
- I'd don't know.

13:28.900 --> 13:33.400
- just wasn't what I was expecting.
Something missing.
- Like what?

13:33.700 --> 13:37.600
I don't know. Well, at the mall 
he has all this warmth...

13:37.900 --> 13:40.700
...and he's got this jolly sense of 
humor. Oh, you should see him...

13:40.900 --> 13:45.700
- ...when he laughs, his whole stomach 
shakes.

13:45.900 --> 13:48.500
Oh, my God! You're in love 
with Santa Claus.

13:49.700 --> 13:53.000
- No, I'm not.
- Well, it makes sense 
when you think about it.

13:53.200 --> 13:57.200
Santa's the perfect man.  He's a good 
listener, he likes to travel...

13:57.400 --> 13:59.600
- ...he gives great presents. 
- Give me a break.

14:00.100 --> 14:04.500
Admit it.
You want the jelly belly.

14:05.700 --> 14:10.400
- Okay, don't be gross. 
- You want to bang-boots with the big boy. 

14:12.100 --> 14:16.400
- I have to get to work.
- You want to get your paws on the Claus 
is more like it.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.900
- Stop it, Daphne! That's enough!

14:20.100 --> 14:22.700
One more: 
you're a Ho, Ho, Ho.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.100
Dad! What are you doing 
still sitting there?

14:35.220 --> 14:39.220
- I told you ten minutes ago that we were 
going out for Christmas Eve ice cream. 
- Oh, I changed my mind.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.400
Eddie and I are too bloated from the nog.

14:42.900 --> 14:47.100
Well, then maybe we should, uh, take 
Eddie and uh, walk it off.  
Come on, mister!? Let's go! 

14:47.400 --> 14:52.100
No, I'm gonna be up early for work. I sure 
could use somethin' to nibble on, though.

14:53.300 --> 14:56.300
- No, no, no, no.
- Stop pushing. Stop pushing.

14:57.500 --> 15:01.600
- Listen, dad's still here, I couldn't 
get rid of him. Come back in an hour.
- No, we can't do that.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.800
The maintenance man in dad's building was 
so nervous about us taking these 
out of the lobby,

15:05.000 --> 15:08.400
I promised him we'd have our real gifts 
under his tree by ten o'clock.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.700
Alright, what we need is a really good 
distraction.  I'll tell you what.

15:11.850 --> 15:14.450
Knock when you think of one. 

15:16.000 --> 15:18.600
- What were you doing out there?
- Nothing.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.400
Thought I heard the door knock. 

15:24.000 --> 15:26.200
Hey, that's pretty good.

15:28.800 --> 15:33.100
Oh, hello guys. Dad, look who it is.
It's Niles and Daphne. 

15:33.350 --> 15:35.100
I see 'em.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.600
- So, what brings you two here?
- Good question, Frasier. Daphne? 

15:38.750 --> 15:42.950
- I need your father's help with a present, 
and that's what we're doing here.
- Exactly, yes. 

15:44.100 --> 15:47.500
- Come on Martin, we can do this 
in my old room. 
- No problem. 

15:50.100 --> 15:54.900
Okay, now! Real presents go out 
in the hall by the door, 
fake presents under the tree.

15:55.050 --> 15:58.750
Niles, did you notice my Christmas 
village? Would you like to see smoke w
aft out of the cobbler's chimney?

15:58.900 --> 16:00.800
Uh, maybe later.

16:00.950 --> 16:03.050
Frasier, I have to warn you.

16:03.250 --> 16:07.250
These prop boxes are heavy - some 
idiot weighed them down with bricks.

16:07.400 --> 16:11.100
Just with our luck, we get the only 
lobby decorator in all of Seattle. 

16:16.700 --> 16:19.300
- How much time do you think 
Daphne can buy over dad?
- Not much.

16:19.420 --> 16:22.820
They're just putting batteries in 
the digital camera we're giving you.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.900
- Act surprised.
- Right!

16:27.100 --> 16:30.300
- I said I'd get them!!
- Oh, you'll never find them.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.900
How could you ask me to put batteries in 
when you didn't bring any batteries?

16:34.600 --> 16:39.700
- Now, boys, you know the rules. 
No shaking The presents.
- You see Niles, I told you.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.800
I found them. Let's go.

16:43.100 --> 16:47.000
- Daphne! No more surprises.
- Oh, you mean like finding 
your father here,

16:47.200 --> 16:51.000
- ...when the apartment should be empty?
- Well, you can blame that on the nog!

16:53.100 --> 16:54.700
Frasier,

16:54.900 --> 16:58.600
- ...I think I'm going to sleep tonight, 
I feel like I'm ten years old.

16:58.800 --> 17:02.200
Yes. Only this time we have the merry 
chance of playing Santa. 

17:09.200 --> 17:13.300
- Niles, I'm so sorry that we almost 
ruined Christmas with our arguing.
- Stop!

17:13.500 --> 17:16.700
- I just took that from under the tree.
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. I know, 'cause that's real,

17:16.849 --> 17:19.150
and fake ones are in a pile by the door.

17:19.300 --> 17:23.099
- The elevator door?
- No, the apartment one! That's where all 
the fake ones are!

17:24.099 --> 17:27.500
- Great. Now what do we do?
- Well here, alright, you take these.
I take those.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.600
What are we...

17:34.700 --> 17:37.700
- Where do we go?
- How the hell should I know?

17:37.900 --> 17:40.550
That's a flat head 
and I need a Phillips head.

17:40.700 --> 17:44.700
- See, I told you, if you rearrange them 
they look fuller.
- Yes, yes.

17:44.850 --> 17:47.750
I see what you mean, Niles.  
It's all a matter of perspective.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.500
Wow, it looks like twice as many.

17:50.700 --> 17:53.800
Uh, put them back the way they were 
and show me how you did that.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.300
Got the Philips. Let's go.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.500
- He could be an assassin 
in those slippers.
- Are you going to switch the presents?

18:00.650 --> 18:04.250
Or are you going to argue about 
whose Christmas village is bigger?

18:06.300 --> 18:09.200
I knew it! You didn't compliment mine, 
because you have one too.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.900
I didn't compliment yours, because 
yours is so poorly laid out!!

18:14.200 --> 18:17.500
- Alright, alright. We don't have time 
for this, now which ones are which?
- Oh, oh! I have them all organized.

18:17.650 --> 18:20.550
- Here, take those out.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, absolutely. These are the real ones.

18:20.700 --> 18:24.000
- These go to dad, out in the hall 
and we'll take them together.
- Fine, alright, alright.

18:24.500 --> 18:28.400
- Fine, then here. Now we're all set.
All the fake ones are under the tree.

18:28.600 --> 18:32.000
Yes, now you put those in the elevator. 
I'll tell Daphne the coast is clear. 

18:32.200 --> 18:35.200
Do you have any idea how much 
I paid for that?

18:35.400 --> 18:39.300
Well, it's not my fault. Those little 
plastic hinges snap off 
if you look at them.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.300
- Now what am I supposed to give 
as a gift, now?
- Oh, stop cryin'.

18:42.500 --> 18:46.100
- Just put a little duct tape on it 
and it'll be good as new.
- It was new! 

18:46.800 --> 18:49.600
Here Daphne, I'll help you 
find the tape.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.200
What's the matter, boy?
Too much eggnog, huh?

18:56.100 --> 19:01.500
Okay. Hey, Daph.  Be sure to use 
the silver duct tape, not the brown.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.100
The silver will match the camera... 
oops...

19:04.350 --> 19:08.250
...the present. 
I'm takin' Eddie for a walk.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.400
Wait, dad! I'll do that. 
You should just relax.

19:11.600 --> 19:14.800
No, that's alright. 
I need the fresh air.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.500
Uh-oh. 
What's this, more presents?

19:19.100 --> 19:22.900
- Is this why you were trying 
to keep me busy back there?
- Yes.

19:23.800 --> 19:28.100
Oh, ohh, why, you didn't need to do 
that. Bring 'em on in. 
Frasier, give your brother a hand.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.600
Mix them all up, 
so they'll look fuller.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.200
.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.200
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

19:47.200 --> 19:49.900
Niles.  So... how are you?

19:50.100 --> 19:54.600
Well, uh, tired and a little poorer. 
Had to bribe the maintenance man 
at dad's building...

19:54.800 --> 19:57.950
to get him to stay late. Which reminds me, 
on your next show you have to give

19:58.100 --> 20:01.100
something called a "shout-out" 
to a Steve Gomez.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.400
- Right. 
- This is so exciting.

20:03.550 --> 20:07.150
I can't wait to see the look on your 
father's face when we go over there 
and surprise him.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.100
Merry Christmas!

20:11.900 --> 20:14.500
Dad, uh, what are you doing here?

20:14.700 --> 20:17.800
- Yes, shouldn't you be at work?
- The boss called, I don't have to go in.

20:17.950 --> 20:21.550
Seems he was feeling guilty about me 
missing Christmas with my family.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.800
Ooh, heavy.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.400
This must be a good one, 
unless it's a book.

20:29.600 --> 20:34.200
- But, who's covering the desk?
- Nobody, she's shut down tight 
'til tomorrow.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.400
Now, I have just enough patience 
to wait for the cocoa

20:37.600 --> 20:40.300
before I start tearing into these.

20:45.300 --> 20:47.100
Um... dad?

20:47.300 --> 20:50.100
Don't tell me there's no cocoa.

20:55.700 --> 20:59.100
Hello?? Hello?

21:00.700 --> 21:03.800
You'd think there'd be a custodian 
or someone in there.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.400
Nah, I knew it'd be a long shot. There 
won't be anyone in 'til tomorrow morning.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.400
- Sorry, dad.
- Oh, forget it.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.900
It was a really sweet gesture. 
Would have been terrific, but... 

21:19.500 --> 21:22.300
.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.500
You know,

21:26.800 --> 21:30.000
we could throw a brick through 
the glass,

21:30.400 --> 21:33.600
but they're all wrapped up 
under our tree.
