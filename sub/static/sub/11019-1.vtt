JACQUIMO
La, la-la-la-la-Ia-la-la-la

02:17.596 --> 02:20.850
<i>If you follow your heart</i>

02:21.684 --> 02:25.229
<i>Ho, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho</i>

02:25.396 --> 02:28.524
<i>When you follow your heart</i>

02:28.691 --> 02:33.487
Hello. Welcome to Paris, city of love.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.657
Who am I? I am Jacquimo...

02:36.824 --> 02:42.621
...swallow extraordinaire
and lover of beautiful things.

02:43.455 --> 02:47.251
<i>You're sure to do impossible things</i>

02:47.418 --> 02:50.588
<i>If you follow your heart</i>

02:51.422 --> 02:55.092
<i>You're sure to fly on magical wings</i>

02:55.259 --> 02:58.429
<i>When you follow your heart</i>

02:58.596 --> 03:03.517
Oh, that is very nice, n'est-ce <i>pas?</i>
And I like what it is saying.

03:03.684 --> 03:09.565
It is saying, "Follow your heart
and nothing is impossible!"

03:13.444 --> 03:18.824
<i>You're sure to do impossible things</i>

03:18.991 --> 03:22.995
Ha, ha! I love the sound of my voice!

03:24.455 --> 03:27.917
<i>When you follow your heart</i>

03:28.292 --> 03:31.712
<i>When you follow</i>

03:31.879 --> 03:39.803
<i>Your heart</i>

03:41.889 --> 03:44.141
I love great romances.

03:44.308 --> 03:48.437
I myself am a swallow
of great passion.

03:52.316 --> 03:57.947
These are stories about people
with impossible problems.

03:58.113 --> 04:03.160
Samson loved Delilah.
Oh, that was really impossible.

04:03.327 --> 04:06.997
Romeo et Juliet, oh, impossible

04:08.499 --> 04:15.339
But the most impossible of all
the stories is impossibly small.

04:16.130 --> 04:21.595
The story of Thumbelina.

04:21.887 --> 04:25.182
Once upon a time,
there was a lonely woman...

04:25.349 --> 04:29.520
...who longed to have a child
to call her own.

04:29.687 --> 04:33.190
One day she paid a visit
to a good witch...

04:33.357 --> 04:37.278
...who gave her a tiny barleycorn.

04:37.444 --> 04:42.908
"Plant it in a flowerpot," she says,
"and see what happens."

04:43.158 --> 04:46.078
The woman did as she was told...

04:46.245 --> 04:49.832
...and by and by it began growing.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.501
<i>Until at last...</i>

04:52.668 --> 04:56.922
Oh, what a pretty flower!

05:20.446 --> 05:22.364
Hello, Mother.

05:26.285 --> 05:29.872
I will call you "Thumbelina."

05:30.372 --> 05:32.374
Thumbelina.

05:32.541 --> 05:37.838
But can you imagine the troubles
for a little girl...

05:38.005 --> 05:40.466
...no bigger than your thumb, hmm?

05:52.936 --> 05:55.939
<i>Who is the girl no bigger
Than a bumblebee?</i>

05:56.523 --> 05:58.942
<i>Who is the angel
With a funny name?</i>

06:00.486 --> 06:04.114
<i>We don't know where she's from
Or how she came to be</i>

06:04.281 --> 06:07.159
<i>But happy was the day she came</i>

06:08.202 --> 06:10.037
<i>Thumbelina</i>

06:10.204 --> 06:12.122
<i>She's a funny little squirt</i>

06:12.289 --> 06:13.791
<i>Thumbelina</i>

06:13.957 --> 06:16.293
<i>Tiny angel in a skirt</i>

06:16.460 --> 06:17.961
<i>Thumbelina</i>

06:18.128 --> 06:20.172
<i>First she's mending, then baking</i>

06:20.339 --> 06:23.801
<i>Pretending, she's making things up</i>

06:23.967 --> 06:26.553
<i>Thumbelina</i>

06:32.476 --> 06:36.313
<i>Who would believe the wonder
Of the world I see?</i>

06:36.480 --> 06:40.359
<i>Each little minute brings a new surprise</i>

06:40.526 --> 06:43.821
<i>There's only one peculiar thing
That bothers me</i>

06:43.987 --> 06:47.825
<i>Seems I'm the only one my size</i>

06:47.991 --> 06:49.827
<i>Thumbelina</i>

06:49.993 --> 06:51.995
<i>Think of all you'll save on meals</i>

06:52.162 --> 06:53.747
<i>Thumbelina</i>

06:53.914 --> 06:55.833
<i>Maybe if you had high heels</i>

06:55.999 --> 06:57.793
<i>Thumbelina</i>

06:57.960 --> 07:00.129
<i>If you stay here forever</i>

07:00.295 --> 07:02.714
<i>We know that we'll never be glum</i>

07:02.881 --> 07:03.924
<i>By gum</i>

07:04.091 --> 07:05.717
<i>Thumbelina</i>

07:05.884 --> 07:07.761
<i>She is always in the thick</i>

07:07.928 --> 07:10.013
<i>Thumbelina</i>

07:10.180 --> 07:11.849
<i>But I get out in the nick</i>

07:12.015 --> 07:13.767
<i>Thumbelina</i>

07:13.934 --> 07:16.019
<i>Fortune sometimes
Has tricked us</i>

07:16.186 --> 07:17.938
<i>But this time it's picked us</i>

07:18.105 --> 07:19.857
<i>Oh, a plum's so big
A plum</i>

07:20.023 --> 07:21.817
<i>And a fig's so big</i>

07:21.984 --> 07:26.447
<i>And they call it a twig
But a twig's so big</i>

07:26.613 --> 07:29.616
<i>It's a great big world</i>

07:29.950 --> 07:36.790
<i>Thumbelina</i>

07:36.957 --> 07:38.584
That's me!

07:42.671 --> 07:47.176
Now, here's a story
about the noble dog...

07:47.384 --> 07:51.680
...who saved the king
from the wicked wizard.

07:51.847 --> 07:56.518
Once upon a time--
Oh, Mother, please.

07:56.685 --> 08:00.939
Are there any stories
about little people?

08:01.106 --> 08:04.735
Well, as a matter of fact
there are, Thumbelina. Look.

08:09.114 --> 08:12.326
They are little, just like me.

08:12.993 --> 08:18.040
But what are those?
They're wings, Thumbelina.

08:18.207 --> 08:23.504
These are fairies, and fairies
have wings so they can fly.

08:25.506 --> 08:30.177
Mother, have you ever seen a fairy?

08:30.344 --> 08:33.013
Well, I thought I did once.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.057
- Really?
- Yes.

08:35.265 --> 08:40.437
And here, the fairy prince
and princess are having a wedding.

08:40.604 --> 08:44.274
And they live happily ever after.

08:44.483 --> 08:47.194
Oh, usually, dear.

08:47.361 --> 08:51.865
Hmm. I suppose it works best...

08:52.032 --> 08:55.953
...if two people are
about the same size.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.247
Yes, of course.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.290
Yes...

09:05.128 --> 09:06.922
Well, that's not fair.

09:07.089 --> 09:12.094
I must be the only little person
in the whole world.

09:12.261 --> 09:17.683
I wish I were big.
Oh, no, Thumbelina. No.

09:17.849 --> 09:22.437
Don't ever wish to be anything
but what you are.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.820
Bedtime, my dear.

09:29.987 --> 09:33.865
It's been a long day.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.578
You must go to sleep now.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.584
Sleep tight.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.628
Mother?
Mm-hm?

09:46.795 --> 09:49.006
Would you please leave
the book open?

09:49.172 --> 09:50.257
Of course, dear.

09:50.424 --> 09:53.760
I wanna look
at the pictures while I go to sleep

09:56.471 --> 09:59.808
- There.
- Good night, Mother.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.768
Good night, Thumbelina.

10:04.438 --> 10:07.399
You take good care of her, Hero.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.328
Hmm.

10:35.135 --> 10:39.681
<i>I know there's someone</i>

10:39.848 --> 10:42.434
<i>Somewhere</i>

10:42.601 --> 10:45.646
<i>Someone</i>

10:45.812 --> 10:50.275
<i>Who's sure to find me</i>

10:50.442 --> 10:56.198
<i>Soon</i>

10:56.573 --> 11:01.411
<i>After the rain goes</i>

11:01.578 --> 11:07.376
<i>There are rainbows</i>

11:07.542 --> 11:12.214
<i>I'll find my rainbow</i>

11:12.381 --> 11:17.552
<i>Soon</i>

11:18.095 --> 11:23.308
<i>Soon it won't be just pretend</i>

11:23.475 --> 11:30.565
<i>Soon a happy ending</i>

11:30.732 --> 11:35.362
<i>Love, can you hear me?</i>

11:35.529 --> 11:41.284
<i>If you're near me</i>

11:41.451 --> 11:46.957
<i>Sing your song</i>

11:47.124 --> 11:51.712
<i>Sure and strong</i>

11:51.878 --> 12:03.765
<i>And soon</i>

12:08.603 --> 12:14.025
I wonder if there really are
such things as fairies.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.610
Hmm.

13:10.373 --> 13:13.752
Oh, my dear.
Don't look now, dear husband...

13:13.919 --> 13:18.006
...but our son is missing again.
So he is.

13:18.173 --> 13:22.469
I think he feels a bit silly, riding
that white butterfly we gave him.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.221
Why should he feel silly?

13:24.387 --> 13:28.141
It makes the wrong impression
on the young ladies.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.061
What about the impression
on the court?

13:31.228 --> 13:36.066
Colbert, it is the autumn today and
we've begun the golding of the leaves.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.400
He should be here.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.362
Tabitha.
He'll hurt himself.

13:40.570 --> 13:44.741
I hope he's not out buzzing
the vales on that wretched bee.

13:44.908 --> 13:47.410
He is the crown prince,
for heaven's sake.

13:48.787 --> 13:53.333
Tabitha, dear, have you
forgotten what it's like to be 16?

13:57.921 --> 14:00.382
Whoa.

14:00.549 --> 14:05.595
Oh! Hello! What a beautiful voice.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.222
I wonder who she is.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.100
Stay here, boy.
I'll check this out.

14:22.404 --> 14:27.534
Oh. You have to go now? I see.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.620
You are a wonderful dancer.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.915
Will I ever see you again?

14:38.336 --> 14:39.754
May I cut in?

14:40.338 --> 14:44.092
Ah!
No. Wait, wait. Come back.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.927
I apologize.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.596
I didn't mean to frighten you.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.391
Ts k-ts k-ts k

14:51.558 --> 14:54.311
There. See?
No more sword.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.063
Now, will you come out?

15:10.410 --> 15:12.370
Ah.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.461
Wait a minute.
What are you staring at?

15:19.628 --> 15:22.505
Well, say something, will you?

15:24.049 --> 15:26.384
You're... Oh!

15:26.551 --> 15:29.054
You're one of them.
I beg your pardon?

15:30.096 --> 15:34.225
I thought I was the only one
my size in the whole world.

15:38.021 --> 15:42.192
Hero, no.
No, he's a friend. Look.

15:42.359 --> 15:47.364
Hello, my name is Thumbelina.
How do you do, sir?

15:47.530 --> 15:50.200
Uh, thank you for coming to visit.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.035
Uh... Oh. Oh.

15:52.202 --> 15:56.915
No trouble at all.
The pleasure is mine.

16:03.588 --> 16:09.052
Sorry about that.
Thumbelina.

16:09.219 --> 16:12.347
It's a lovely name.
Thank you.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.808
I'm Cornelius.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.726
Cornelius?

16:18.103 --> 16:20.355
Well, that's a funny name.

16:20.522 --> 16:22.899
I mean it's perfect.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.901
Uh...

16:25.068 --> 16:30.240
Tell me about the fairy court.
ls there a prince?

16:31.032 --> 16:34.661
Yes.
He must be terribly handsome.

16:34.828 --> 16:38.748
He is.
Strong and brave.

16:38.915 --> 16:42.877
None like him.
I would love to meet the prince.

16:43.169 --> 16:46.756
I'll tell him.
Thank you.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.676
Oh, you're welcome.

16:51.136 --> 16:53.471
What was that?
Oh.

16:53.638 --> 16:57.851
That's Buzzby, my bumble.
I left him on the sill.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.687
He doesn't like staying
in one place too long.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.355
Why didn't you say something?

17:02.522 --> 17:03.565
Come on!

17:06.443 --> 17:08.361
Oh, my!

17:08.528 --> 17:12.281
He's amazing!

17:12.449 --> 17:15.660
Hey, would you like to go for a spin?

17:15.910 --> 17:17.579
Come on, let's go.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.545
I wish I had wings.
Maybe someday you will.

17:25.712 --> 17:29.257
Hold on tight. Whoa!

17:36.139 --> 17:39.350
<i>Let</i> me be your wings

17:40.018 --> 17:44.564
<i>Let me be your only love</i>

17:44.731 --> 17:51.571
<i>Let me take you far beyond the stars</i>

17:52.238 --> 17:55.992
<i>Let me be your wings</i>

17:56.159 --> 18:00.497
<i>Let me lift you high above</i>

18:00.663 --> 18:07.670
<i>Everything we're dreaming of
Will soon be ours</i>

18:08.129 --> 18:12.008
<i>Anything that you desire</i>

18:12.175 --> 18:15.845
<i>Anything at all</i>

18:16.012 --> 18:19.849
<i>Every day I'll take you higher</i>

18:20.016 --> 18:24.145
<i>And I'll never let you fall</i>

18:24.312 --> 18:27.857
<i>Let me be your wings</i>

18:28.024 --> 18:32.529
<i>Leave behind the world you know</i>

18:32.695 --> 18:38.993
<i>For another world of wondrous things</i>

18:40.120 --> 18:44.124
<i>We'll see the universe</i>

18:44.290 --> 18:47.794
<i>And dance on Saturn's rings</i>

18:47.961 --> 18:55.343
<i>Fly with me and I will be your wings</i>

18:55.635 --> 18:58.388
She's gonna marry
the prince, huh, Mom?

18:58.555 --> 18:59.722
Well, perhaps.

18:59.931 --> 19:03.685
<i>Anything that you desire</i>

19:03.852 --> 19:07.897
<i>Anything at all
Anything at all</i>

19:08.064 --> 19:11.693
<i>Every day I'll take you higher</i>

19:11.860 --> 19:16.656
<i>And I'll never let you fall</i>

19:16.823 --> 19:20.076
<i>You will be my wings
Let me be your wings</i>

19:20.243 --> 19:26.499
<i>You will be my only love
Get ready for another world</i>

19:26.666 --> 19:31.921
<i>Of wondrous things
Wondrous things are sure to happen</i>

19:32.088 --> 19:35.425
<i>We'll see the universe
We'll see the universe</i>

19:35.592 --> 19:40.180
<i>And dance on Saturn's rings
And dance on Saturn's rings</i>

19:40.346 --> 19:43.892
<i>Heaven isn't too far</i>

19:44.058 --> 19:47.770
<i>Heaven is where you are</i>

Wings</i>

20:03.870 --> 20:07.165
<i>This voice is fantástica!</i>

20:07.332 --> 20:11.711
Mama, I love her.

20:21.471 --> 20:24.265
Oh, Thumbelina.

20:24.432 --> 20:27.185
Oh, wow. Something...
I don't know...

20:27.352 --> 20:29.687
Something happened to me tonight.

20:29.854 --> 20:34.025
Something I never wanna forget.
Me too.

20:34.192 --> 20:39.030
Do not forget me.
Forget-me-nots.

20:39.239 --> 20:42.533
I'll never forget you. Never.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.496
- Never, never.
- Cornelius.

20:46.663 --> 20:49.332
Oh, Mother.
What--? Mother!

20:49.499 --> 20:54.504
- Cornelius, come now.
- Who are those people?

20:54.671 --> 20:59.300
It's no time to explain. That's the
queen of the fairies, my mother.

20:59.467 --> 21:03.680
Your mother?
Yeah. Look, I must go now, but...

21:03.846 --> 21:07.475
Can I see you tomorrow?
Your mother?

21:07.642 --> 21:11.312
Then you're the...
You are the...

21:11.479 --> 21:13.773
Tomorrow?
Yes, tomorrow.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.400
Yes, I'm the prince.

21:15.566 --> 21:20.154
The prince?
Yeah. Will you meet my parents?

21:20.321 --> 21:21.364
Cornelius!

21:21.531 --> 21:23.783
Say you will.
I...

21:25.076 --> 21:26.536
I Will.
You Will?

21:26.703 --> 21:32.083
I will.
I will, Prince Cornelius, yes.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.961
- Cornelius.
- Cornelius.

21:35.128 --> 21:38.339
I've gotta go.
Will they like me?

21:38.506 --> 21:41.426
Get down.
Yes, they'll love you.

21:41.592 --> 21:45.013
But let me talk to them first.
Tonight.

21:45.179 --> 21:48.141
And then I'll be back for you
in the morning.

21:48.308 --> 21:51.978
Then you can meet my mother.
Well, great.

21:52.145 --> 21:56.149
But, well, wait here.
And then...

21:56.316 --> 22:01.612
...we'll live happily ever after.
Oh, much longer.

22:01.779 --> 22:05.908
- Cornelius.
- Ooh! Goodbye.

22:06.117 --> 22:08.870
You won't forget to come back,
will you?

22:09.037 --> 22:11.372
I promise.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.125
Whoa!

22:21.674 --> 22:25.428
Oh, Cornelius.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.698
Hmm.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.242
Gotcha!

22:48.409 --> 22:50.286
What?!

22:50.453 --> 22:52.163
Hey! Help!

22:52.330 --> 22:55.917
Help, Hero! Let me out of here.

22:56.084 --> 23:00.421
Oh, oh! Hero, help. Help me!

23:04.258 --> 23:06.719
A dog!

23:07.929 --> 23:10.556
Get away from me.

24:02.859 --> 24:04.902
Thumbelina. Oh...

24:05.486 --> 24:08.948
Thumbelina. Thumbelina. Oops.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.533
Got it.

24:10.825 --> 24:14.245
Thumbelina, it's me.
Where are you?

24:36.601 --> 24:40.897
Where is she?
What? What happened?

24:42.440 --> 24:45.693
She was stolen away?
Out the window?

24:46.861 --> 24:48.279
Who did it?

24:52.116 --> 24:54.452
A toad?

24:55.786 --> 24:57.371
Good dog.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.833
I'll find her.

25:02.752 --> 25:07.590
No, Hero. You stay here
and take care of Thumbelina's mother.

25:07.757 --> 25:10.593
Let her know
everything will be all right.

25:33.574 --> 25:35.368
I hope you sleep very, very good.

25:35.576 --> 25:38.371
Huh? Who are you?

25:39.247 --> 25:42.166
We are the very happy
Family Singers <i>de</i> España.

25:42.333 --> 25:47.713
Mozo, Gringo and Grundel.

25:50.591 --> 25:54.345
We are very rich and famous.
Rich and famous?

25:55.805 --> 25:59.141
I bring you here to become
famous singer like me.

25:59.308 --> 26:03.896
Goodbye. My mother will
be very worried.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.649
Mama no worry. Mama proud.

26:06.816 --> 26:09.360
When you are a star,
she make big fiesta...

26:09.527 --> 26:15.533
...and invite all the neighbors to see her
little <i>niña</i> who have become very big.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.952
Big?

26:18.119 --> 26:19.328
You mean big?

26:19.495 --> 26:21.205
I mean important.

26:21.372 --> 26:24.458
And loved by everyone.

26:24.667 --> 26:27.795
But Cornelius
loves me already.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.755
I think I'm gonna marry him.

26:30.423 --> 26:31.924
Marry him?

26:32.174 --> 26:34.427
That will be a very big mistake.

26:34.594 --> 26:40.057
It'll get in the way of your career in show
business, doing those things domésticos.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.976
What things?

26:42.685 --> 26:44.520
<i>The scrubbings and the washings</i>

26:44.687 --> 26:45.980
<i>And the noses with the drippings</i>

26:46.147 --> 26:48.691
<i>And the sopas always boiling</i>

26:50.192 --> 26:52.320
<i>The panes of windows falling
With the diapers changing</i>

26:52.486 --> 26:56.782
<i>With the roof, she's leaking
And the enchiladas spoiling</i>

26:56.949 --> 26:58.117
Ooh.

26:58.284 --> 27:01.370
<i>Do you know how to do these things
Like you will have to do these things?</i>

27:01.537 --> 27:04.373
<i>Or does the very thought of it
Make you wince?</i>

27:04.540 --> 27:05.541
Ugh.

27:05.708 --> 27:07.126
<i>I thought so</i>

27:07.293 --> 27:13.341
<i>Then don't marry the prince</i>

27:13.507 --> 27:15.176
Oh, dear...

27:15.343 --> 27:18.929
You see?
You become big star, like me.

27:19.096 --> 27:23.351
We make big moneys together.
You make Mama rich.

27:23.517 --> 27:29.106
You're important person.
You are famous. You are a star!

27:29.273 --> 27:33.235
A star? Well, I suppose.

27:33.402 --> 27:37.031
Now, repeat after me.

27:37.198 --> 27:39.283
<i>We are the Singers de España
The original cast</i>

27:39.450 --> 27:41.577
<i>And there hasn't been a town

27:41.744 --> 27:42.870
<i>We are the Singers de España</i>

27:43.037 --> 27:44.330
<i>And we sing very fast
We get on</i>

27:44.497 --> 27:45.665
<i>We get off
We get paid</i>

27:45.956 --> 27:51.045
Could you say that a little slower?
Slower? We don't do ballads.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.964
Maybe I can take notes.

27:54.215 --> 27:56.217
<i>We are free and independent
We go everywhere</i>

27:56.384 --> 27:58.594
<i>We gotcha-gotcha goochee all the way</i>

27:58.761 --> 28:00.721
<i>We gonna teach you how to samba

28:13.859 --> 28:16.946
<i>You'll be hot muchacha
Once I gotcha on the road</i>

28:17.113 --> 28:18.864
<i>Thumbelinacita</i>

28:19.031 --> 28:20.950
<i>No one could be sweeter</i>

28:21.117 --> 28:22.993
<i>Sing with mamacita</i>

28:23.160 --> 28:24.412
<i>We go on the road</i>

28:31.585 --> 28:32.628
<i>Now we sing</i>

28:33.212 --> 28:35.297
<i>We open Monday in Medina
Then we do Babylon</i>

28:35.464 --> 28:37.133
<i>Then we hop to Barcelona for a week</i>

28:37.299 --> 28:39.260
<i>Then for a month in Athens
At the Parthenon</i>

28:39.427 --> 28:41.470
<i>Where they love us
'Cause we do the show in Greek</i>

28:41.637 --> 28:43.472
<i>We are the finest in the business
It's</i> a <i>well-known fact</i>

28:43.639 --> 28:45.474
<i>And you'll forgive us
If we have to blow the horn</i>

28:45.641 --> 28:47.643
<i>Because this isn't any ordinary animal act</i>

28:47.810 --> 28:49.311
<i>And today a star is born</i>

28:55.443 --> 28:57.319
<i>But that's what makeup's for</i>

28:57.486 --> 28:59.155
<i>Just sing on pitch</i>

28:59.321 --> 29:00.740
<i>We'll get very rich</i>

<i>Something Thumbelina</i>

29:10.499 --> 29:11.834

29:24.764 --> 29:26.974
<i>The life, she's sweet
Lots of flies to eat</i>

29:27.141 --> 29:28.184
Yum-yum.

29:28.350 --> 29:32.605
<i>So why be a little fish in little pond
When you can go so far beyond?</i>

29:32.772 --> 29:35.274

<i>Let's hit the road, olé!</i>

29:58.839 --> 30:02.343
Mama,
you give her to me...

30:02.510 --> 30:03.719
...I marry her.

30:03.886 --> 30:06.430
Very well. You can marry la <i>niña.</i>

30:06.764 --> 30:10.559
We can keep the money she earns
in the family.

30:10.726 --> 30:15.523
Thank you, Mrs. Toad. Thank you.
They really like me.

30:15.731 --> 30:19.318
Am I a star?
Yes, and you can call me Mama.

30:19.485 --> 30:23.405
Mama?
You're going to marry my son Grundel.

30:23.656 --> 30:26.367
I'm what?
I love Thumbelina.

30:26.575 --> 30:32.581
We'll be right back with the Padre.
Oh, no, no.

30:32.748 --> 30:37.795
I love Cornelius.
Today, you marry my son.

30:38.754 --> 30:40.589
Oh, no. No, no.

30:40.756 --> 30:43.133
No, I'm not marrying--
Come back here!

30:43.300 --> 30:47.221
Wait a second.
Where are you going?

30:47.429 --> 30:51.642
Doesn't anybody care what I think?

30:55.020 --> 30:58.107
- Help!
- Whoa! Help?

30:58.274 --> 31:01.610
- Who is saying "help"?
- Mr. Bird, over here.

31:01.819 --> 31:05.823
Oh! Little one,
are you having a bad day?

31:05.990 --> 31:11.245
I was sleeping on the windowsill,
waiting for Prince Cornelius to come.

31:11.412 --> 31:14.456
He said he'd come
because he loves me and--

31:14.623 --> 31:16.208
He loves you?
Yes.

31:16.375 --> 31:20.963
Congratulations!
Thanks. But, well...

31:21.130 --> 31:23.591
But I was stolen away
by Mrs. Toad...

31:23.757 --> 31:27.011
...who says I have to marry her son.

31:27.219 --> 31:32.433
A toad? That is a very bad day,
Mademoiselle...?

31:32.600 --> 31:36.270
Thumbelina.
Thumbelina, I am Jacquimo.

31:36.478 --> 31:39.440
How can I be of service to you?

31:39.607 --> 31:42.401
Well, I must get off this lily pad...

31:42.568 --> 31:44.945
...but that's impossible.

31:45.195 --> 31:48.240
Ha-ha-ha!
Nothing is impossible.

31:52.828 --> 31:58.250
Voila!
Oh, my. Well, that was easy.

31:58.417 --> 32:05.049
Now if I can just reach the shore
before those awful toads come back.

32:05.424 --> 32:10.971
Do you mean if you can reach the shore
before you go over the waterfall?

32:11.180 --> 32:15.184
What waterfall?
That one!

32:15.351 --> 32:16.852
Is it bad?

32:20.022 --> 32:22.191
I am slipping!

32:22.358 --> 32:23.567
Don't let go!

32:23.776 --> 32:24.860
Can you swim?

32:25.027 --> 32:28.197
No, I can't swim. I can't even float.

32:28.364 --> 32:31.450
Help! Help, please!

32:31.617 --> 32:33.786
Somebody help!

32:33.953 --> 32:38.749
- Help! Somebody help!
- Help!

32:42.461 --> 32:44.964
Jitterbugs, help!

33:01.647 --> 33:07.152
- Pull, mes amis, pull!
- That is it. Higher, higher.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.216
What is it?
Yeah. Who is it?

33:29.591 --> 33:32.928
Look, Mama, she's waking up.

33:33.095 --> 33:35.848
Are you feeling better, little one?

33:36.015 --> 33:38.183
Yes, I think so.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.311
Who are you?

33:41.478 --> 33:43.897
Thumbelina,
these are the jitterbugs.

33:44.064 --> 33:48.444
The jitterbugs?
How do you do?

33:48.610 --> 33:52.614
Are you really gonna marry
the fairy prince?

33:53.532 --> 33:58.078
If he asks me.
He will call for me at my house.

33:58.245 --> 34:03.250
That's why I wanna go home.
Besides, mother will be terribly worried.

34:05.794 --> 34:10.882
If only I could find my way home.
We'll help you, Thumbelina.

34:11.050 --> 34:14.887
Nobody will hurt you.
Not with us on the job, right?

34:15.054 --> 34:19.224
- Right.
- You are all very brave. Thank you.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.643
But I'm afraid I'll never see
my home again.

34:22.811 --> 34:26.315
Oh. Do you love the prince?

34:26.482 --> 34:27.649
Yes.

34:27.858 --> 34:31.737
Then follow your heart.
It will lead you home.

34:31.904 --> 34:35.324
Now, where does the prince live?

34:35.616 --> 34:42.164
He lives in the Vale of the Fairies.
But I don't know where that is either.

34:42.331 --> 34:48.295
Do not worry. I, Jacquimo, will
find it and bring him home to you.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.924
It's impossible.

34:52.091 --> 34:56.594
Impossible? Nothing is impossible.

34:57.179 --> 35:02.101
<i>You're sure to do impossible things</i>

35:02.267 --> 35:05.270
<i>If you follow your heart</i>

35:05.437 --> 35:06.480
Ha, ha!

35:06.647 --> 35:11.276
<i>Your dreams will fly on magical wings</i>

35:11.443 --> 35:15.364
<i>When you follow your heart</i>

35:16.281 --> 35:20.702
<i>If you have to journey far
Here's a little trick</i>

35:20.869 --> 35:26.041
<i>You don't need a guiding star
Trust your ticker, get there quicker</i>

35:26.208 --> 35:27.835
Ha, ha!

35:28.210 --> 35:32.965
<i>You're sure to do impossible things</i>

35:33.132 --> 35:37.803
<i>If you follow your heart</i>

35:38.345 --> 35:42.099
Come on, Thumbelina!
You are going home!

35:42.266 --> 35:45.769
Your mother is waiting!
Get up, get up!

35:47.396 --> 35:50.941
<i>You're sure to do impossible things</i>

35:51.108 --> 35:54.236
<i>If you follow your heart</i>

35:54.903 --> 35:57.573

35:57.739 --> 35:59.449
Sing, my little chickadees!

35:59.616 --> 36:02.161
<i>When you follow your heart</i>

36:02.327 --> 36:05.831
<i>North or south or east or west
Where to point your shoes?</i>

36:05.998 --> 36:07.833
<i>Which direction is the best?</i>

36:08.000 --> 36:12.087
<i>If the choosing gets confusing
Maybe it's the math you're using</i>

36:12.254 --> 36:18.093
<i>You don't need a chart to guide you
Close your eyes and look inside you</i>

36:18.260 --> 36:19.303
Ha, ha!

36:19.469 --> 36:24.266
<i>You're sure to do impossible things</i>

36:24.433 --> 36:27.936
<i>If you know where to start</i>

36:28.103 --> 36:29.146
Ha, ha!

36:29.313 --> 36:33.442
<i>Your dreams will fly on magical wings</i>

36:33.609 --> 36:35.402
<i>When you follow</i>

36:35.569 --> 36:37.404
<i>Just trust the swallow</i>

36:37.571 --> 36:41.700
<i>And always follow</i>

36:41.867 --> 36:46.288
<i>Your heart</i>

36:48.498 --> 36:53.337
Bon voyage, Thumbelina!
Never fear, I will find the prince.

36:53.503 --> 36:56.381
goodbye!

36:56.632 --> 37:01.178
He's wonderful.
And I'm going home.

37:13.398 --> 37:20.072
Cornelius, my sunshine, first you buzzed
in here on that wretched thing...

37:20.322 --> 37:25.661
...and announced before the court that
you'd found the girl of your dreams.

37:25.827 --> 37:29.039
And now you come back to say
she's vanished?

37:29.248 --> 37:31.833
Kidnapped. She's been kidnapped!

37:32.000 --> 37:33.377
You're joking!
Tabitha.

37:33.543 --> 37:37.047
Please delay the winter frost
as long as you can.

37:37.214 --> 37:40.801
- I need time to find Thumbelina.
- Cornelius!

37:41.343 --> 37:43.095
Don't worry, Mother, I'll be back.

37:43.553 --> 37:44.930
Cornelius!

37:45.097 --> 37:47.891
I'll find her!

37:48.058 --> 37:50.477
Oh, my poor boy.

37:51.270 --> 37:57.526
Colbert, my love, we can't delay
the frost for more than a day.

38:09.538 --> 38:13.333
Hey, bro?
Go away.

38:13.542 --> 38:16.253
Pond talk says Thumbelina
gave you the slip...

38:16.420 --> 38:18.964
...and is gonna marry a fairy prince.

38:19.881 --> 38:22.175
What fairy prince?

38:22.426 --> 38:26.430
You not be able to show
your ugly face on-stage no more.

38:26.596 --> 38:29.850
Everybody laugh at you.
Nobody laugh.

38:31.310 --> 38:34.813
I said, nobody laughs!

38:35.897 --> 38:40.444
I go get Thumbelina
and bring her back.

38:43.697 --> 38:45.240
Whoa!

38:45.615 --> 38:48.493
I marry her!

39:06.178 --> 39:07.929
Look out!

39:08.096 --> 39:09.973
Ha, ha!
Aah!

39:11.558 --> 39:16.813
Hi, toots. Beetle's my name
and razzmatazz is my game.

39:16.980 --> 39:20.984
How do you do? Everything okay?
I'm not your toots.

39:21.151 --> 39:23.528
Where do you come from?
Up there.

39:23.695 --> 39:27.866
I'm a connoisseur of sweet nectars,
a designer of rare threads...

39:28.033 --> 39:31.536
...and a judge of beautiful women.

39:31.703 --> 39:36.333
And you are beautiful, Miss...?

39:36.500 --> 39:39.836
Thumbelina. And I'm going home.

39:40.045 --> 39:44.383
What's your hurry, toots?
Relax. Take a load off.

39:44.549 --> 39:49.096
I wish you wouldn't do that.
Perhaps you'd prefer this?

39:50.472 --> 39:54.309
Mr. Beetle! I don't even know you.

39:54.476 --> 39:57.604
Would you stop?
Stop? How can I stop?

39:57.771 --> 40:01.775
I'm crazy about you, toots.
You're gorgeous.

40:02.067 --> 40:05.946
Oh.
You're exciting. Delicious.

40:06.154 --> 40:11.326
I am?
And I love the sound of your voice.

40:11.493 --> 40:15.914
My voice?
Don't talk! Sing. Sing to me.

40:18.375 --> 40:22.421
<i>I have an idea
Can you fly</i> me <i>up there?</i>

40:22.587 --> 40:28.301
Um, why should I, toots?
From the tree I could see my house.

40:28.468 --> 40:32.013
I'd know if I'm traveling
in the right direction to get home.

40:32.180 --> 40:38.103
Gee, I don't know. That would be
a big, big, oh, very big favor.

40:38.270 --> 40:41.314
<i>I'll sing, I'll sing for you</i>

40:41.481 --> 40:46.736
No, no. You'll sing
at the Beetle Ball. And dance.

40:49.656 --> 40:53.285
We are gonna be
the talk of the town, toots.

40:53.452 --> 40:58.707
I'm not your toots,
and I don't even look like a beetle.

40:59.374 --> 41:02.377
Come on, let's get help.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.889
<i>Ladies and gentlebugs...</i>

41:14.055 --> 41:17.684
<i>...Berkley Beetle proudly presents
Thumbelina!</i>

41:41.082 --> 41:43.835
<i>Baby, it's the Beetle ball</i>

41:44.085 --> 41:45.670
<i>And bugs are crawling to get in</i>

41:45.837 --> 41:50.300
<i>When they hear that beetle beat
Those beetle feet'll start to spin</i>

41:50.467 --> 41:52.594
<i>And how to cheer</i>

41:52.761 --> 41:54.471
<i>For you, my dear</i>

41:55.096 --> 41:56.306
<i>You're beautiful, baby</i>

41:59.601 --> 42:01.520
<i>Oh, my little butterfly</i>

42:01.686 --> 42:04.105
<i>You flutter by at each romance</i>

42:04.272 --> 42:05.941
<i>Every chance to dance with you</i>

42:06.107 --> 42:08.568
<i>Puts the ants back in my pants</i>

42:08.735 --> 42:10.195
<i>Let's cut a rug</i>

42:10.987 --> 42:12.447
<i>My ladybug</i>

42:12.948 --> 42:14.783
<i>You're beautiful, baby</i>

42:16.743 --> 42:21.122
<i>I get</i> a <i>buzz when I have you on my wing</i>

42:21.289 --> 42:24.960
<i>You tie my antennae in a knot</i>

42:26.378 --> 42:29.047
<i>Now the room's reelin'</i>

42:29.214 --> 42:31.299
<i>And I'm feelin' so</i>

42:31.466 --> 42:33.718
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

42:33.885 --> 42:35.637
<i>Hot to trot</i>

42:38.431 --> 42:40.684
Let's dance, baby!

42:43.144 --> 42:47.107
Isn't she beautiful?
Just adorable, darling.

42:47.315 --> 42:51.403
What a piece of work.
Will you look at her?

42:51.653 --> 42:54.823
Okay, toots, let's wing it.
I can't wing it.

42:54.990 --> 42:59.327
I don't have any wings.
I'm getting dizzy!

43:00.954 --> 43:02.038
Ew!

43:07.669 --> 43:10.171
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

43:10.338 --> 43:12.215
Hee-hee-hee-hee
Ha-ha-ha-ha

43:12.382 --> 43:14.384
She, she, she, she's
So, so, so, so

43:14.551 --> 43:16.386
<i>Hey, that bug is a dog</i>

43:16.886 --> 43:19.347
- My, my!
- Unattractive.

43:19.556 --> 43:22.684
The word, my dear, is ugly.

43:22.934 --> 43:26.855
- She's so ugly it hurts my feelers.
- I hope it ain't catching.

43:27.647 --> 43:29.899
Disgraceful.

43:30.066 --> 43:32.444
<i>Would you look at that
She ain't got no wings</i>

43:32.611 --> 43:34.946
<i>Good gracious, me
What are those things?</i>

43:35.113 --> 43:37.449
<i>She ain't got no feelers
No feelers?</i>

43:37.616 --> 43:39.784
<i>She ain't got no shell
Do tell</i>

43:39.951 --> 43:43.788
<i>She's got scrawny legs and knobby knees
For all we know, the gal's got fleas</i>

43:43.955 --> 43:46.541
<i>She can't even fly
No, that won't do</i>

43:46.708 --> 43:48.710
<i>So say goodbye
She's not for you</i>

43:48.877 --> 43:53.882
Sorry, toots,
I guess you're too...ugly!

43:54.382 --> 43:57.385
Don't worry, you'll get over me.

43:57.552 --> 43:59.387
I'm ugly?

44:03.558 --> 44:05.560
Hey, wait for me.

44:05.727 --> 44:08.271
Hurry, Thumbelina needs help.

44:15.737 --> 44:20.116
Do I hear one of you say
Thumbelina needs help?

44:20.283 --> 44:21.743
- Yes.
- Gnatty!

44:21.910 --> 44:24.287
The beetle took her
and flew way up there.

44:24.496 --> 44:26.206
Be quiet.

44:28.249 --> 44:33.963
The beetle? I want her back!

44:35.423 --> 44:37.634
Come on, let's go!

44:37.884 --> 44:40.929
You big, ugly wart-face.

44:44.099 --> 44:48.395
Now we see about this beetle.

44:52.107 --> 44:56.611
<i>You're sure to do impossible things</i>

44:56.778 --> 45:00.532
<i>If you follow your heart</i>

45:00.699 --> 45:05.412
<i>You're sure to fly on magical wings</i>

45:05.578 --> 45:09.249
<i>If you follow your heart</i>

45:10.750 --> 45:13.628
What is the matter, Thumbelina?

45:14.421 --> 45:19.634
I'm cold. I'm lost. And I'm hungry.

45:19.801 --> 45:23.638
And the beetle says I'm ugly.
The beetle?

45:25.598 --> 45:27.684
Do you love the beetle?
No.

45:27.851 --> 45:31.771
Then never mind the beetle.
Good riddance to the beetle.

45:31.938 --> 45:34.149
And good riddance to the toad!

45:35.358 --> 45:39.320
Does Prince Cornelius
think you are ugly?

45:40.155 --> 45:43.783
No, he thinks I'm beautiful.

45:43.950 --> 45:48.705
And so you are, mon amie. Look.

45:51.458 --> 45:54.669
I'm going home.

45:54.836 --> 45:57.297
Jacquimo?
Hmm?

45:57.464 --> 46:01.509
Will you find the Vale of the Fairies?
I promise.

46:02.343 --> 46:06.890
I promise. But now we must sleep.

46:12.729 --> 46:16.399
Thank you, Jacquimo.
Thank you.

46:22.030 --> 46:24.324
Tomorrow is a new day.

46:24.491 --> 46:30.830
And I will go to the forest and see
if I can find your Prince Cornelius.

46:47.263 --> 46:49.057
A nice sunny day, huh?

46:49.224 --> 46:53.061
It's sunny, all right,
but I'm not too sure about the nice.

46:54.562 --> 46:58.191
I am looking for
the Vale of the Fairies.

46:58.358 --> 47:02.946
Fairies? Beats the heck out of me.
Why don't you ask a fairy?

47:03.154 --> 47:06.699
You know one?
No, but he might.

47:12.247 --> 47:15.250
Excusez-moi,
I am looking for the Vale of--

47:15.416 --> 47:17.418
Am-scray!

47:18.294 --> 47:23.299
I can see you are a very busy fox,
so I will be brief.

47:23.466 --> 47:26.302
Buzz off, buster!

47:31.766 --> 47:35.395
Look. Look what I do.

47:35.562 --> 47:40.191
I have a thorn in my wing.
This is bad, very bad.

47:41.067 --> 47:45.113
Mon <i>Dieu,</i> I hope I still can fly.

47:46.823 --> 47:48.283
I fl)'

47:50.702 --> 47:53.454
It only stings a little.

47:53.913 --> 47:57.500
Now, where was I?

47:57.792 --> 48:01.004
Autumn. It is Autumn.

48:01.963 --> 48:05.800
I must hurry to find the fairy prince.

48:06.092 --> 48:09.304
Winter is almost here.

48:10.722 --> 48:12.974
Thumbelina!

48:14.642 --> 48:17.979
Thumbelina, where are you?

48:28.907 --> 48:31.826
Whoa. Whoa!

48:42.462 --> 48:45.506
I'm looking for
a beautiful young woman.

48:45.673 --> 48:48.676
Her name is Thumbelina.

48:48.843 --> 48:50.678
Are you the fairy prince?

48:50.887 --> 48:54.015
I am.
Thumbelina's gone.

48:54.265 --> 48:58.853
Gone? Where did she go?
The beetle took her away.

48:59.020 --> 49:01.522
- What?
- They're out there. Somewhere.

49:01.773 --> 49:03.983
She's out there? In that?

49:04.150 --> 49:08.154
- There's a big toad after her.
- Oh, no.

49:08.321 --> 49:13.826
I've got to find her.
Winter's almost here.

49:14.702 --> 49:18.957
Hurry, Buzz! My father can't
hold back the frost much longer.

49:19.874 --> 49:22.210
Okay, okay!

49:22.377 --> 49:24.712
Can I explain something?
What?

49:25.797 --> 49:31.386
I don't know where she is.
We didn't hit it off too good.

49:31.552 --> 49:35.264
So I let her go. She's not my type.
She's an ugly type.

49:35.431 --> 49:36.891
I don't like ugly.

49:37.684 --> 49:39.268
She is beautiful!

49:39.435 --> 49:44.065
Whatever you say.
Look, I got an idea.

49:44.232 --> 49:48.403
I hear that she loves
the fairy prince, right?

49:51.114 --> 49:56.244
I crush fairy prince!
Okay, shut up and listen.

49:56.411 --> 50:03.084
Why don't you just nab this prince
and set up a trap for the girl...

50:03.251 --> 50:08.881
...using him as the bait.
You know, get her to come to you.

50:09.048 --> 50:11.592
Nab the prince?
And set up a trap.

50:11.759 --> 50:15.430
Nab the prince.
Yes. And set up a trap.

50:15.596 --> 50:19.225
Do you speak English?
Try to keep up, Grundel, okay?

50:19.392 --> 50:22.437
Don't shout!
You're making me very nervous.

50:22.603 --> 50:26.441
You go capture prince.

50:26.607 --> 50:29.110
You took my wings!
You can't do that!

50:29.277 --> 50:34.323
Yeah? I keep wings
until you nab prince.

50:34.490 --> 50:39.787
Listen, pal, this harassment has gone
far enough, and I know my rights.

50:39.954 --> 50:43.291
I'll report you to the pond patrol.

50:43.458 --> 50:47.003
Okay, okay. Cool it, cool it.

50:47.170 --> 50:52.133
Where's your sense of humor?
All right, I'll nab the prince.

50:52.300 --> 50:56.763
Come on, guys.
Mind the wings. I'll be back.

51:08.149 --> 51:11.986
<i>Excusez-moi, Monsieur Bear'?</i>

51:13.988 --> 51:17.492
I am looking for
the Vale of the Fairies.

51:17.658 --> 51:22.121
I don't want no berries.

51:23.998 --> 51:28.211
No, no, no. Fairies, not berries.

51:30.338 --> 51:34.133
Wake up, you fat lummox!

51:36.636 --> 51:39.055
I said, wake up!

51:46.354 --> 51:53.027
I am having a very bad day.
Mon Dieu, it is so cold.

51:58.491 --> 52:02.161
Winter! Winter is here.

52:03.579 --> 52:05.873
Oh-ho!

52:08.876 --> 52:14.715
This thorn... It hurts to fly.

52:17.844 --> 52:21.389
- Don't worry, Buzz.
- We're gonna make it.

52:21.848 --> 52:24.016
Thumbelina! Oh.

52:29.814 --> 52:31.649
Whoa!

52:55.756 --> 53:00.386
- He takes my wings away.
- Now I have to walk to find the prince.

53:00.553 --> 53:05.600
If he let me keep my wings,
I could fly after the prince.

53:05.766 --> 53:11.939
Hey, Beetle, this guy's the prince.
The prince? Ah! The prince!

53:12.106 --> 53:17.778
Somebody up there loves me!
Okay, you pick him up.

53:17.945 --> 53:21.616
Let's get out of this stinking weather
before we're statistics.

53:21.782 --> 53:25.828
I can't even feel anything
in my feelers any more.

53:26.078 --> 53:28.915
A guy with my brains,
I gotta talk to a toad.

53:29.081 --> 53:32.293
What kind of conversation
can you have with a toad?

53:32.460 --> 53:34.295
What? They're toads.

54:07.203 --> 54:09.997
Jacquimo was wrong.

54:10.164 --> 54:14.168
I will never find my way home.

54:14.335 --> 54:16.963
It's impossible.

54:18.631 --> 54:23.010
Oh, Mother, where can you be?

55:03.050 --> 55:07.847
<i>I know there's someone</i>

55:08.014 --> 55:10.391
<i>Somewhere</i>

55:10.558 --> 55:12.727
<i>Someone</i>

55:13.728 --> 55:18.733
<i>Who's sure to find her</i>

55:18.899 --> 55:24.071
<i>Soon</i>

55:24.613 --> 55:29.535
<i>After the rain goes</i>

55:29.702 --> 55:35.207
<i>There are rainbows</i>

55:35.374 --> 55:40.546
<i>She'll find the rainbow</i>

55:40.713 --> 55:45.009
<i>Soon</i>

55:45.760 --> 55:51.140
<i>Soon my breaking heart will mend</i>

55:51.307 --> 55:58.439
<i>Soon a happy ending</i>

55:59.023 --> 56:03.361
<i>Troubles behind her</i>

56:03.527 --> 56:09.283
<i>I will find her</i>

56:09.450 --> 56:14.538
<i>Homeward bound</i>

56:15.164 --> 56:21.295
<i>Safe and sound</i>

56:21.462 --> 56:28.302
<i>And soon</i>

56:47.446 --> 56:49.657
Feeling better, my dear?

56:57.123 --> 57:00.709
Where am I?
In my kitchen.

57:00.876 --> 57:05.047
I'm Ms. Fieldmouse
and we are snug and safe underground.

57:05.297 --> 57:07.925
I'm underground?

57:08.092 --> 57:09.718
Yes, dearie, three feet under.

57:09.885 --> 57:13.472
I dug it myself
with my own two hands.

57:14.306 --> 57:16.183
Here, drink this.

57:16.851 --> 57:19.854
At least that toad
won't find me down here.

57:20.479 --> 57:22.857
There's something
I don't understand.

57:23.023 --> 57:27.403
Did you really think you could
survive the winter in that old shoe?

57:27.570 --> 57:30.197
Ha, ha! Honestly!

57:30.364 --> 57:31.615
I wanna go home.

57:31.782 --> 57:36.996
Well, I'm afraid you'll just have
to wait here till spring, Thumbelina.

57:37.163 --> 57:40.249
You know my name!
Oh, that was easy.

57:40.416 --> 57:45.504
I know much more. Like, you were
engaged to the fairy prince.

57:45.671 --> 57:47.882
Cornelius, I believe?

57:48.048 --> 57:49.842
Well, almost.

57:50.176 --> 57:52.553
That is so sad.

57:52.720 --> 57:53.929
What?

57:54.180 --> 57:58.726
That he was found stone-cold
frozen dead in the snow.

58:00.019 --> 58:05.733
But of course you knew that?
No. Cornelius, no!

58:05.900 --> 58:10.613
- That is so sad.
- No, it's not true. No!

58:18.621 --> 58:20.748
Oh, Thumbelina.

58:20.915 --> 58:24.752
Forgive me. Sometimes I just
blurt things out without thinking.

58:24.919 --> 58:27.963
You're still young, though.
There'll be another.

58:28.923 --> 58:31.217
He was perfect.

58:31.425 --> 58:34.428
Nobody's perfect.
Cornelius was the only one--

58:34.595 --> 58:38.891
Now, put this on. We'll take
these corn cakes to Mr. Mole.

58:39.058 --> 58:41.352
He lives just down the tunnel.

58:41.519 --> 58:43.103
I'd rather not.

58:43.437 --> 58:47.775
I saved your life this very day
and you'd rather not?

58:48.651 --> 58:52.238
Very well.
One more thing...

58:52.404 --> 58:56.408
...is it true that you have
a beautiful voice?

58:57.952 --> 59:01.121
I don't feel much like singing.

59:01.288 --> 59:03.123
You must sing for Mr. Mole.

59:03.290 --> 59:07.169
He loves sweet things.
Come on.

59:08.295 --> 59:11.966
Mr. Mole loves his corn cakes.

59:12.424 --> 59:18.472
Cornelius was looking for me.
That's what must have happened.

59:34.530 --> 59:37.533
Good afternoon, Mr. Mole.
Oh, yes.

59:39.326 --> 59:43.289
Ms. Fieldmouse?
Good afternoon. Lovely day.

59:43.455 --> 59:47.418
I want you to meet a new friend
of mine, Thumbelina.

59:47.626 --> 59:52.339
She just came down from up there.
"Up there"?

59:52.506 --> 59:55.843
Up there.
Terrible place.

59:57.678 --> 59:59.179
<i>Mmm.</i>

59:59.346 --> 01:00:03.350
How do you do, Miss Thumbelina?
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:06.687
How do you do, Mr. Mole?

01:00:06.854 --> 01:00:10.691
Come in. Don't touch anything.
These are my things.

01:00:10.858 --> 01:00:16.196
We brought some corn cakes for you.
Just you try one, Mr. Mole.

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:18.991
Ooh. Mmm.

01:00:22.036 --> 01:00:27.374
Very nice.
Well, tell us about up there.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:30.377
I went up once. Nearly blinded me.

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:34.340
Hurried as fast as I could
back down where it's dark and decent.

01:00:34.506 --> 01:00:37.092
Oh. Uh, but...

01:00:37.718 --> 01:00:42.014
I love the light.
I hate it. End of story.

01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:46.185
Story. Thumbelina,
tell Mr. Mole a story.

01:00:46.352 --> 01:00:49.396
A lovely, sad story.

01:00:49.772 --> 01:00:51.231
Well...

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:55.152
Stand right there,
where I can see you.

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:57.029
Okay.

01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:03.410
Oh, I love love stories,
don't you?

01:01:03.619 --> 01:01:07.915
Once upon a time,
there was the sun.

01:01:08.082 --> 01:01:12.419
Sing it, Thumbelina. Sing.
She sings?

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:16.423
Shh!
Oh. Um...

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:20.886
<i>Once there was the sun</i>

01:01:21.053 --> 01:01:25.432
<i>Bright and warm and wonderful</i>

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:33.315
<i>Shining like the love within my heart</i>

01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:46.829
<i>Now there's no more sun</i>

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:52.000
<i>Winter has killed everything</i>

01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:56.630
<i>And although it's dark December</i>

01:01:56.797 --> 01:01:58.716
<i>Forever</i>

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:04.096
<i>I 'll remember sun</i>

01:02:06.432 --> 01:02:12.020
Winter has killed everything,
even the sun.

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:16.984
Wonderful story.
Dreadful thing, the sun.

01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:20.946
And now,
I have a story to tell you.

01:02:22.156 --> 01:02:27.161
Just this morning, as I was
out for my early morning stroll...

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:30.998
...I found the most extraordinary
thing in my tunnel:

01:02:31.165 --> 01:02:33.542
- A dead bird.
- No!

01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:39.506
Yes. How do you suppose
a dead bird got into my tunnel?

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:43.844
Well, I'm certainly glad
I'm not a bird.

01:02:44.011 --> 01:02:48.682
Bothering the world with endless
twittering, twittering, twittering...

01:02:48.891 --> 01:02:52.686
My, yes. Oh, there it is!

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:54.354
Oh!

01:02:57.816 --> 01:03:00.611
Whatever do you suppose
happened to him?

01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:05.365
Well, there's one less bird
to twitter, twitter, twitter up there.

01:03:05.616 --> 01:03:09.203
Oh, Jacquimo. Jacquimo.

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:12.039
My dear, dear friend.

01:03:12.748 --> 01:03:16.585
- Tender little thing.
- Yes, quite lovely.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:22.090
Ms. Fieldmouse, could I have
a word with you?

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:24.676
I wish you would.

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:31.058
You know I have been meaning
to take a wife for some time now.

01:03:31.225 --> 01:03:33.185
What a lovely idea.

01:03:33.352 --> 01:03:37.940
I find myself sometimes, you know...

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:42.861
...lonely for companionship.
What could be more natural?

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:45.531
And I wonder if--
Yes?

01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:50.786
If I could ask you to help me
persuade Miss Thumbelina...

01:03:50.953 --> 01:03:53.789
...to be my wife?

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:56.542
Thumbelina?

01:03:57.751 --> 01:04:01.547
She could keep me company
and tell me stories.

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:03.590
Yes.

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:07.553
And for your service in helping
to arrange this match...

01:04:07.719 --> 01:04:11.265
...I will reward you handsomely.

01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:16.478
Dear Ms. Field mouse
Oh! I Will. I Will!

01:04:16.687 --> 01:04:21.608
Leave the arrangements to me.
Thumbelina?

01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:26.113
I hear your heart.
You're not dead, no.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:30.409
Jacquimo. Jacquimo.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:36.957
- I'll come back. Tonight.
- Thumbelina?

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:46.091
- One ice-cold prince coming up.
- Where do you want him?

01:04:46.258 --> 01:04:49.845
There. He looks dead.

01:04:50.012 --> 01:04:53.682
Dead? Dead, schmed!
What difference does it make?

01:04:53.849 --> 01:04:57.644
You killed him.
Okay, okay, have it your way.

01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:01.023
I killed him.
There, you satisfied?

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:05.110
Forget the prince, all right?

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:11.033
What if I were to tell you
I know where Thumbelina is right now?

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:14.995
What if I told you that?
Would you give me my wings?

01:05:15.162 --> 01:05:18.999
I'm glad you kill prince.
It's a deal.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:23.378
Good. My sources tell me...

01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:26.798
...she's buried alive with the mole.

01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:29.676
Mole? What mole?

01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:33.805
If I were you, I'd get my tail
over there and save her.

01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:36.683
Go. Get hopping.
Oh, and give me my wings.

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:41.563
Where does mole live?
I go kick down his door.

01:05:41.772 --> 01:05:46.860
Ooh! Ooh! Stop! Stop!
What's going on? Where are we going?

01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:49.821
We go rescue Thumbelina
from the mole.

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:53.867
Mole? Are you out of your mind?
I'm not going down there.

01:05:54.034 --> 01:05:58.538
Do you know what he does to beetles?
Do you have any idea?

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:02.542
He stuffs them. He stuffs them
and he pins them on his walls.

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:05.879
Quiet!
Why don't you just marry a toad?

01:06:06.046 --> 01:06:07.089
Ever think about that?

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:10.300
Find a pretty toad with warts
and marry her.

01:06:10.509 --> 01:06:14.054
Quiet!
Toads. I gotta be stuck with toads.

01:06:14.221 --> 01:06:18.058
- They've got the fairy prince.
- We've gotta help him.

01:06:18.225 --> 01:06:20.727
Come on, guys, let's build a fire.

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:29.945
All the same,
we'll make it a thrilling wedding.

01:06:32.364 --> 01:06:38.870
Why, it's a wonderful match! Mr. Mole
is the richest rodent for miles around.

01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:43.583
Educated, well-dressed,
highly thought of...

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:48.255
Never mind that he can't see.
That's all the better.

01:06:48.422 --> 01:06:52.551
How can I possibly marry Mr. Mole?
I don't love him.

01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:59.641
Love? Love is what we read about
in books, my dear.

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:05.939
<i>"Here Comes the Bride"
ls a lovely little ditty</i>

01:07:06.106 --> 01:07:10.610
<i>But marrying for love
ls a foolish thing to do</i>

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:15.365
<i>'Cause love won't pay the mortgage
Or put porridge in your bowl</i>

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:19.077
<i>Dearie, marry the mole</i>

01:07:22.247 --> 01:07:26.543
<i>True, it's a fact that he's not exactly witty</i>

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:31.298
<i>He's blinder than a bat
But at least his eyes are blue</i>

01:07:31.465 --> 01:07:35.844
<i>His breath may be alarming
But he's charming for a troll</i>

01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:40.057
<i>Dearie, marry the mole</i>

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:44.144
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>

01:07:44.978 --> 01:07:48.982
<i>Were very much in love
When they were wed</i>

01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:53.653
<i>They honored every vow
So where are they now?</i>

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:56.239
<i>They're dead, dead</i>

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:58.742
<i>Very, very dead</i>

01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:05.332
<i>Poor Thumbelina
Your brain's so itty-bitty</i>

01:08:05.499 --> 01:08:09.920
<i>I hate to</i> seem a <i>pest
But I know what's best for you</i>

01:08:10.087 --> 01:08:14.841
<i>Just think of all the ways
That you can decorate a hole</i>

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:19.220
<i>Take my advice
I'll bring the rice</i>

01:08:19.386 --> 01:08:23.140
<i>Dearie, marry the mole</i>

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:27.604
<i>Marry the mole</i>

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:34.736
<i>Marry that mole</i>

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.531
<i>M is for money</i>

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:39.533
<i>Oh
L-E</i>

01:09:06.852 --> 01:09:12.023
Please be warm, dear friend.
Please live.

01:09:20.407 --> 01:09:26.203
Poor little swallow. I'm sorry
for all the trouble I've caused you.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:29.082
I know now...

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:34.296
...there's no place in this big world
for little people.

01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:37.048
We...

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:41.553
We cannot do impossible things.

01:09:42.888 --> 01:09:45.932
Perhaps I should marry the mole.

01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:50.604
He could take care of me.
He could.

01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:58.904
I Will.

01:09:59.905 --> 01:10:01.948
I will marry the mole.

01:10:03.617 --> 01:10:07.287
You are joking?
Jacquimo?

01:10:07.621 --> 01:10:13.126
Marry the prince.
Jacquimo, you're awake!

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:16.630
Oh, Jacquimo!

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:18.506
Ow! Ow.

01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:24.304
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have a thorn in my wing.

01:10:24.471 --> 01:10:28.850
A thorn? Well, let me see.

01:10:29.309 --> 01:10:33.980
Oh, my goodness.
Hold still.

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:36.691
Ah!
There.

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:43.865
Now it will get better.
Don't get up.

01:10:44.074 --> 01:10:47.327
No, no, I go to find the Vale
of the Fairies and the prince.

01:10:47.494 --> 01:10:50.997
You silly bird, don't you understand?

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:55.043
Get on my back.
I will take you to the green forest.

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:59.005
Be realistic. Cornelius is gone.

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:02.801
I will find him. Remember...
Jacquimo, don't.

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:05.845
<i>You're sure to do impossible things</i>

01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:08.515
Stop! Stop it, Jacquimo!

01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:09.933
<i>--Your heart</i>

01:11:10.684 --> 01:11:12.519
Bon voyage, mon amie.

01:11:12.686 --> 01:11:14.646
Jacquimo!
Bon voyage!

01:11:15.689 --> 01:11:18.817
No. Jacquimo.

01:11:19.818 --> 01:11:24.364
Oh, Jacquimo, stop torturing me.

01:11:24.531 --> 01:11:27.826
Cornelius is dead.

01:11:37.377 --> 01:11:38.545
There.

01:11:38.712 --> 01:11:42.716
Does he know Mr. Mole
is gonna many Thumbelina?

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:47.554
We'll find out when the ice melts.
Then we'll tell him.

01:11:49.556 --> 01:11:51.182
Whoa!

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:57.689
Look, he's waking up.

01:12:18.752 --> 01:12:22.547
<i>Let</i> me be your wings

01:12:22.714 --> 01:12:26.968
<i>Let me be your only love</i>

01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:33.099
<i>Let me take you
Far beyond the stars</i>

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:39.439
Mr. Mole, do you take this
woman to be your lawful wedded wife?

01:12:39.606 --> 01:12:42.233
<i>Let me be your wings</i>

01:12:43.735 --> 01:12:47.739
<i>Let me lift you high above</i>

01:12:47.906 --> 01:12:53.828
<i>Everything we're dreaming of
Will soon be ours</i>

01:12:55.789 --> 01:12:57.457
I do.

01:12:57.624 --> 01:13:01.544
<i>Anything that you desire</i>

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:05.048
<i>Anything at all</i>

01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:09.969
And, Thumbelina,
do you take this mole...

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:13.515
...to be your lawful wedded husband?

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:16.351
Do not forget me.

01:13:16.518 --> 01:13:18.812
<i>Forget-me-nots.</i>

01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:22.315
<i>I'll never forget you. Never.</i>

01:13:22.482 --> 01:13:23.942
<i>Never, never.</i>

01:13:24.109 --> 01:13:25.652
Speak up.

01:13:25.819 --> 01:13:27.654
Never.
What?

01:13:27.821 --> 01:13:29.823
Never.
I beg your pardon?

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:32.826
I cannot marry Mr. Mole.

01:13:34.369 --> 01:13:35.870
I don't love him.
What?

01:13:36.037 --> 01:13:37.122
Thumbelina!

01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:42.627
You?
I marry her!

01:13:42.794 --> 01:13:46.172
No, I no marry you. I go home!

01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:47.674
No!

01:13:47.841 --> 01:13:48.842
Go away!

01:13:50.802 --> 01:13:53.346
After her!

01:13:54.013 --> 01:13:58.685
Ha, ha! Hi, toots.
I'm not your toots.

01:13:58.893 --> 01:14:01.396
- Hey, wait.
- Thumbelina!

01:14:01.563 --> 01:14:04.482
My wings. My wings.

01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:09.779
Whoa! Ah.

01:14:10.697 --> 01:14:11.990
Thumbelina.

01:14:12.157 --> 01:14:16.327
- She marry me!
- That's the toad we told you about.

01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:20.081
We meet at last, Mr. Toad.
Fairy prince?

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:24.711
No. You killed him.

01:14:38.308 --> 01:14:40.226
Oh!

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:44.230
The sun. The sun is shining again.

01:14:51.946 --> 01:14:54.616
Come on, show me what you got.

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:05.126
Let me go!

01:15:06.544 --> 01:15:07.754
Thumbelina?

01:15:14.594 --> 01:15:16.763
Thumbelina, come back.

01:15:42.789 --> 01:15:46.042
Ah, the sun!

01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:50.421
<i>And</i> always follow

01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:53.633
<i>Your heart</i>

01:15:54.175 --> 01:15:59.514
Jacquimo, it's you.
Of course, <i>c'est</i> moi.

01:15:59.681 --> 01:16:05.186
Thumbelina, I have found it.
I found the Vale of the Fairies!

01:16:05.436 --> 01:16:07.689
Oh. Jacquimo.
It is true.

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:10.275
I talked to the rabbit,
who talked to the fox...

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:13.278
...who talked to the deer,
who know for sure.

01:16:13.444 --> 01:16:16.155
I show you. Jump on. Hang on!
Jacquimo!

01:16:23.955 --> 01:16:29.210
We go find the fairy prince.
That's impossible.

01:16:29.419 --> 01:16:31.462
You are wrong.

01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:36.342
I nearly made the biggest mistake
of my life.

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:40.513
I nearly said yes to the mole.
That mountain looks like a turtle.

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:44.517
But I don't love the mole.

01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:58.531
Ah. We are here, we are here!
Hello, hello, hello. Fairies?

01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:00.867
This is it.

01:17:01.034 --> 01:17:02.452
This?

01:17:03.328 --> 01:17:06.706
It just looks like
a patch of ordinary weeds.

01:17:06.873 --> 01:17:09.542
Sing, Thumbelina, sing.

01:17:09.876 --> 01:17:14.213
Jacquimo, please,
can you take me home?

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.633
Sing!

01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:21.721
<i>You will be my wings</i>

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:27.352
<i>You will be my only love</i>

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:34.525
<i>You will take me far beyond the stars</i>

01:17:36.903 --> 01:17:41.366
Jacquimo, this is silly.
This is a weed patch.

01:17:41.532 --> 01:17:44.494
This is the Vale of the Fairies!

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:48.081
Take me home. Please.

01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:51.250
<i>Let me be your wings</i>

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:54.921
Like that. Sing, like that.

01:17:55.088 --> 01:18:00.259
<i>You will lift me high above</i>

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:11.646
<i>Everything we're dreaming of
Will soon be ours</i>

01:18:15.983 --> 01:18:20.446
<i>Anything that we desire</i>

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:25.118
<i>Anything at all</i>

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:29.497
<i>Every day you'll take me higher</i>

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:33.960
Let's be practical.
This isn't the Vale of the Fairies...

01:18:34.127 --> 01:18:37.088
...and Cornelius is never coming back.

01:18:37.255 --> 01:18:41.426
<i>And I'll never let you fall</i>

01:18:41.968 --> 01:18:47.682
You. It's you. Cornelius, you're alive!

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:52.812
Thumbelina, will you marry me?

01:18:52.979 --> 01:18:55.940
I Will.

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:07.660
Wings. I have wings.

01:19:08.578 --> 01:19:10.997
MY Very own wings!

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:47.033
<i>Anything that you desire</i>

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.409
Hello, Mother!

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:52.121
<i>Anything at all</i>

01:19:53.748 --> 01:19:57.710
<i>Every day I'll take you higher</i>

01:19:57.877 --> 01:20:04.509
<i>And I'll never let you fall</i>

01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:41.087
<i>And always</i>

01:20:41.254 --> 01:20:48.427
<i>Follow your heart</i>

01:20:48.594 --> 01:20:51.389
<i>And</i> of course...

01:20:51.556 --> 01:20:57.061
<i>...they lived happily ever after.</i>

01:21:14.662 --> 01:21:19.333
<i>You're sure to do impossible things</i>

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.795
<i>If you follow your heart</i>

01:21:22.962 --> 01:21:23.963
Ha, ha!

01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:28.801
<i>Your dreams will fly on magical wings</i>

01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:32.889
<i>When you follow your heart</i>

01:21:33.806 --> 01:21:38.185
<i>If you have to journey far
Here's a little trick</i>

01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:43.524
<i>You don't need a guiding star
Trust your ticker, get there quicker</i>

01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:45.318
Ha, ha!

01:21:45.735 --> 01:21:50.489
<i>You're sure to do impossible things</i>

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:55.328
<i>If you follow your heart</i>

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:59.624
<i>Come on, Thumbelina!
You are going home!</i>

01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:03.294
<i>Your mother is waiting!
Get up, get up!</i>

01:22:04.879 --> 01:22:08.466
<i>You're sure to do impossible things</i>

01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:11.719
<i>If you follow your heart</i>

01:22:12.386 --> 01:22:15.056
<i>Your dreams will fly on magical wings</i>

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:16.974
<i>Sing, my little chickadees!</i>

01:22:17.141 --> 01:22:19.685
<i>When you follow your heart</i>

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:23.356
<i>North or south or east or west
Where to point your shoes?</i>

01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:25.358
<i>Which direction is the best?</i>

01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:29.570
<i>If the choosing gets confusing
Maybe it's the math you're using</i>

01:22:29.737 --> 01:22:35.618
<i>You don't need a chart to guide you
Close your eyes and look inside you</i>

01:22:35.785 --> 01:22:36.827
Ha, ha!

01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:41.749
<i>You're sure to do impossible things</i>

01:22:41.916 --> 01:22:45.461
<i>If you know where to start</i>

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:46.671
Ha, ha!

01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:50.925
<i>Your dreams will fly on magical wings</i>

01:22:51.092 --> 01:22:52.885
<i>When you follow</i>

01:22:53.052 --> 01:22:54.887
<i>Just trust the swallow</i>

01:22:55.054 --> 01:22:58.683
<i>And always follow</i>

01:22:58.849 --> 01:23:03.813
<i>Your heart</i>

01:23:28.087 --> 01:23:32.299
<i>Let me be your wings</i>

01:23:32.466 --> 01:23:37.179
<i>Let me be your only love</i>

01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:43.936
<i>Let me take you far beyond the stars</i>

01:23:45.646 --> 01:23:50.192
<i>Let me be your wings</i>

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:54.655

<i>Everything we're dreaming of
Everything we're dreaming of</i>

01:23:58.242 --> 01:24:02.538
<i>Will soon be ours
Will soon be ours</i>

<i>Let me be your wings</i>

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:29.648
<i>Leave behind the world you know</i>

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:33.986
<i>For another world of wondrous things</i>

01:24:34.153 --> 01:24:37.990
<i>Wondrous things are sure to happen</i>

01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:41.786
<i>We'll see the universe</i>

01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:46.624
<i>And dance on Saturn's rings</i>

01:24:46.791 --> 01:24:50.669
<i>Fly with me and I will be
Fly with me and I will be</i>

01:24:50.836 --> 01:24:55.591
<i>Your wings
Oh, your wings</i>

01:25:10.106 --> 01:25:15.069
<i>Oh, anything that you desire</i>

<i>Let me be your wings
Let me be your wings</i>

01:25:33.712 --> 01:25:40.386
<i>Let me be your only love
Get ready for another world</i>

01:25:40.553 --> 01:25:46.058
<i>Of wondrous things
Wondrous things</i>

01:25:46.225 --> 01:25:49.937
<i>We'll see the universe</i>

01:25:50.104 --> 01:25:54.733
<i>And dance on Saturn's rings</i>
