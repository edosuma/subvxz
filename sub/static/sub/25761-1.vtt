01:03.938 --> 01:05.648
Grace, what's wrong?

01:16.391 --> 01:17.494
Grace!

01:17.869 --> 01:19.829
- Oh, my God.
- Do you know her?

01:19.871 --> 01:21.373
<i>Every war starts quietly.</i>

01:22.624 --> 01:24.626
<i>Mine started with Grace Somerfield.</i>

01:25.502 --> 01:27.253
<i>She was the first to die.</i>

01:27.921 --> 01:29.798
<i>The first in my class, at least.</i>

01:31.091 --> 01:34.010
<i>A month later, half of my class was dead.</i>

01:35.261 --> 01:37.013
<i>I didn't know why I wasn't.</i>

01:38.973 --> 01:41.351
Scientists have now given a name

01:41.393 --> 01:44.187
to this mysterious
and highly contagious disease.

01:44.229 --> 01:48.983
Idiopathic Adolescent Acute
Neurodegeneration or I.A.A.N.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.610
<i>There seems to be no end to the pain</i>

01:50.652 --> 01:53.113
<i>for parents and families across America.</i>

01:53.154 --> 01:56.491
<i>Nearly 90 percent of the
country's children are now dead.</i>

01:56.533 --> 01:59.369
Strange and unexplained incidents
involving surviving children

01:59.411 --> 02:01.287
continue to pour in from across the country.

02:01.538 --> 02:05.709
<i>Panic calls to 9-1-1 describe cars
moving on their own accord.</i>

02:05.750 --> 02:08.252
<i>If you notice any bizarre
behavior in your children</i>

02:08.294 --> 02:11.965
or the children of those around you,
please report immediately to the CDC.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.883
We now go live to President Gray.

02:14.225 --> 02:15.593
Mr. President!

02:17.512 --> 02:19.973
Do you have any updates
on the I.A.A.N. pandemic?

02:20.015 --> 02:21.099
Uh, yes, I do.

02:21.141 --> 02:25.562
Uh, first, I want to say to you
that I am speaking today...

02:26.438 --> 02:28.690
not as your president, but as a parent.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.317
As you know, my son...

02:32.986 --> 02:36.990
My son is among the survivors,
and for the first time

02:37.032 --> 02:40.785
<i>Clancy's condition has improved
after his treatment at the centers.</i>

02:40.827 --> 02:44.789
But most importantly,
it has given my family hope.

02:44.831 --> 02:49.461
And I urge you, I urge you to give
your children that same hope.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.254
<i>The CDC is here for you.</i>

02:51.296 --> 02:54.382
<i>Please, turn to them for the care
that your children need.</i>

02:54.424 --> 02:55.592
<i>This is not about politics.</i>

02:56.134 --> 02:57.469
This is about your children.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.638
This is about our... Our children.

03:00.930 --> 03:05.643
We will find a cure and we will save our
precious sons and daughters. Thank you.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.070
Mr. President!

03:13.234 --> 03:14.402
Surprise!

03:15.236 --> 03:16.696
Happy birthday, honey.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.203
Gudetama!

03:23.745 --> 03:25.413
That's the one you wanted, right?

03:25.455 --> 03:26.581
Totally.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.125
When you are 16, you can put a car key on it.

03:30.293 --> 03:33.405
It probably won't be cool when I'm 16.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.302
It's okay, Mommy.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.222
You don't have to worry about me.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.140
I'll be fine.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.146
Okay, bedtime.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.315
I love you.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.683
Don't worry anymore, Mommy and Daddy.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.477
Nothing can take me away from you.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.335
- Mom, my head hurts.
- Oh, my God!

04:57.088 --> 04:58.089
How did you get in here?

04:59.466 --> 05:01.968
Sweetheart, are you... Are you lost?

05:02.010 --> 05:04.387
Do your parents know that you're here?

05:06.556 --> 05:08.099
Why are you saying that?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.476
Can you tell me your name?

05:10.352 --> 05:11.853
Mommy, what's wrong?

05:12.520 --> 05:13.897
I am not your mommy.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.274
Yes, you are.

05:16.733 --> 05:17.984
You and Dad gave me this

05:18.026 --> 05:19.903
for my birthday yesterday, remember?

05:19.944 --> 05:21.613
Here, come... Come with me.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.908
Come on, okay? Come on.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.868
What did I do wrong?

05:26.910 --> 05:27.869
Where are we going?

05:27.911 --> 05:29.245
I just need you to wait right here,

05:29.287 --> 05:30.663
just wait right there, okay?

05:30.705 --> 05:31.623
Just wait.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.878
I'm sorry! Please!

05:36.920 --> 05:40.256
This is my house! You're my parents.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.111
Contact made with survivor.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.196
Approach with extreme caution.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.282
No, no!

06:11.454 --> 06:12.747
<i>It was the beginning.</i>

06:14.082 --> 06:17.585
<i>The government wasn't scared
of what happened to the dead kids</i>

06:17.627 --> 06:20.171
<i>or the empty spaces
that they would leave behind.</i>

06:23.800 --> 06:25.385
<i>They were afraid of us.</i>

06:27.262 --> 06:28.513
<i>The ones who lived.</i>

06:29.389 --> 06:32.892
<i>Soon, there wouldn't be any kids anywhere.</i>

06:36.938 --> 06:40.275
<i>You either died or you went to the camps.</i>

06:41.860 --> 06:43.069
Let's move it, now!

06:44.779 --> 06:46.906
- All right, they're coming in.
- Let's go!

06:55.290 --> 06:58.209
Move! Let's go! Don't try to run.

06:58.668 --> 06:59.711
Don't talk.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.006
Don't do anything other than
what is asked of you.

07:03.048 --> 07:06.843
Failure to follow these instructions
will be met with punishment.

07:06.885 --> 07:07.844
Piss off!

07:10.680 --> 07:11.848
Stay down!

07:21.691 --> 07:25.195
LaVine, LaVine! What are you doing?

07:26.196 --> 07:28.865
Orange! He did that! Orange!

07:28.907 --> 07:30.867
Take him out. You know what to do.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.786
Move, all of you. Inside!

07:38.249 --> 07:40.293
<i>All new recruits to color processing.</i>

07:45.799 --> 07:47.467
Is this a hospital?

07:48.218 --> 07:49.344
Name?

07:51.054 --> 07:52.514
Your name, young lady.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.307
Ruby Daly.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.478
I don't feel sick.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.772
Actually, it's not a sickness.

08:00.814 --> 08:04.192
You survived the sickness,
but you're not the same.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.444
And until you are, there's no going home.

08:06.736 --> 08:10.323
Now, when they picked you up,
were you assigned a color?

08:11.241 --> 08:12.283
Color?

08:13.076 --> 08:14.035
Yes.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.455
All kids are given a color assignment

08:17.497 --> 08:19.416
that corresponds to their disorder.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.668
On the bottom here are Greens.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.628
Basic enhanced intelligence.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.506
<i>Blues have telekinetic abilities.</i>

08:26.548 --> 08:29.092
<i>Golds can manipulate electricity.</i>

08:29.801 --> 08:33.763
Up here, past this line,
are the most dangerous.

08:34.304 --> 08:37.558
Reds and Oranges. But they are very rare.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.894
I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.355
Are you very good at math and puzzles?

08:43.188 --> 08:44.566
Because that means

08:44.607 --> 08:46.484
you're most likely in Green territory.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.696
And that's not so terrible.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.165
Orange! Orange! Orange!

09:00.827 --> 09:02.751
Take him out. You know what to do.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.130
It'll be okay. We can fix this.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.175
Get back here!

09:11.134 --> 09:13.386
Stay still. Stay still.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.311
I'm a Green.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.730
I'm one of the smart ones.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.106
Yes.

09:37.911 --> 09:38.953
You're a Green.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.461
<i>In the camps we were segregated by color.</i>

09:47.754 --> 09:48.880
<i>Greens.</i>

09:48.922 --> 09:49.964
<i>Blues.</i>

09:50.465 --> 09:51.675
<i>Golds.</i>

09:52.133 --> 09:53.343
<i>But no Reds.</i>

09:53.843 --> 09:55.220
<i>And no Oranges.</i>

09:56.012 --> 09:57.389
<i>Except for me.</i>

09:59.599 --> 10:01.518
<i>Having been told that our gifts</i>

10:01.559 --> 10:03.520
<i>were finally being brought to light...</i>

10:04.562 --> 10:07.857
<i>I had to bury mine in darkness.</i>

10:22.622 --> 10:24.624
<i>Shift three, report for work duty</i>

10:24.666 --> 10:26.334
<i>at warehouses six, eight and eleven.</i>

10:26.376 --> 10:27.585
Hey! Let's go! Move it!

10:27.627 --> 10:29.754
<i>Stations will be assigned
to you by squad leaders.</i>

10:57.866 --> 10:59.200
Doing it wrong.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.953
Like this.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.831
Look at me.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.626
Look at me.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.547
Look at me!

11:16.593 --> 11:18.678
We're not supposed to look at you.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.931
Hmm. Yeah.

11:22.557 --> 11:26.394
The aglets go over the holes, not under.

11:32.650 --> 11:35.028
I've had my eye on you for a while.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.198
You're too dumb to be a Green.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.867
But after today, we're gonna know the truth.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.369
The aglets go under.

11:44.496 --> 11:45.789
What did you say?

11:46.623 --> 11:47.832
If you want a tighter fit,

11:47.874 --> 11:50.710
the aglets should go under, not over.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.463
Aren't you super smart?

11:54.172 --> 11:56.257
Yeah, like every Green in this room.

11:56.716 --> 12:00.387
I guess inhaling all that shoe polish
killed whatever brain cells you had left.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.974
We'll see about that.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.810
Get your hands off of me!

12:08.019 --> 12:09.479
Run the test!

12:10.105 --> 12:11.940
<i>Initiate subatomic frequency test.</i>

12:11.981 --> 12:13.108
<i>Copy that.</i>

12:16.861 --> 12:18.438
<i>Frequency test one.</i>

12:35.839 --> 12:37.348
Ruby?

12:38.466 --> 12:39.918
Ruby, do you hear me?

12:41.511 --> 12:43.263
Ruby, can you hear me?

12:43.304 --> 12:46.474
Oh, no. Shh, shh! It's okay.
It's okay. Hey. You're okay.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.351
You're gonna be fine, Ruby.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.604
Are you still in pain?

12:54.983 --> 12:56.443
Do you know where you are?

12:59.738 --> 13:00.989
Yes.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.157
Okay.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.366
Hi.

13:04.409 --> 13:05.535
I'm Dr. Begbie.

13:06.369 --> 13:08.997
But if it makes you feel more
comfortable, you can call me Cate.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.540
Forget the doctor business.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.503
You know, before this, I was a social worker.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.467
And you remind me of a girl I used to know.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.012
What happened to her?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.141
I couldn't help her then.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.357
But I want you to know
that I'm here for you now.

13:40.036 --> 13:43.306
Do you remember falling
when they turned on the white noise?

13:45.533 --> 13:46.576
Time's up!

13:51.081 --> 13:52.665
This time it was different.

14:00.382 --> 14:03.218
I need to keep her overnight.
I have more tests to run.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.095
You gotta take that up with Captain McManus.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.781
Results of the frequency test.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.033
Who spiked the highest?

14:30.495 --> 14:32.455
My God, alert the captain.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.624
<i>We got a security breach.</i>

14:34.666 --> 14:36.876
<i>Lock down the infirmary immediately.</i>

14:42.924 --> 14:44.551
Okay. Here.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.428
- Put these on. Hurry, okay?
- Okay.

14:46.469 --> 14:47.637
Let's go.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.431
Play along.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.686
<i>Security breach. Lock down...</i>

14:54.728 --> 14:56.312
Okay, come on. Let's go.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.191
Come on, come on, come on!

15:04.529 --> 15:06.656
Cover your face as much as you can.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.492
If they catch you, they'll kill you.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.845
Hey, I've got Dr. Rogers with me.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.848
Dr. Rogers, ID, please.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.224
Yeah, I have it right here.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.643
She, uh, is zonked out
on pain meds, poor thing.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.521
Dr. Rogers.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.148
I'm gonna have to ask you
to remove your mask.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.649
Captain, I don't think that's a good idea.

15:41.691 --> 15:42.692
She is highly contagious.

15:42.734 --> 15:43.902
Roll down the back window, please.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.070
Captain, I don't think that's a...

15:45.111 --> 15:46.571
We have a security breach.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.031
Roll down the back window.

15:49.074 --> 15:51.143
I'm not asking again.

15:56.414 --> 15:57.749
Dr. Rogers...

15:58.333 --> 16:00.377
I'm ordering you to remove your mask.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.003
- Understood?
- Cap...

16:02.420 --> 16:03.421
Now!

16:07.217 --> 16:08.677
You don't feel well.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.596
Uh... I don't feel well.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.765
You will let us move on.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.105
Move along.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.324
Oh, my God!

17:21.165 --> 17:22.416
Where are we?

17:23.209 --> 17:25.670
We just left Harvey, West Virginia.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.382
We met up with a friend
who helped me switch cars.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.302
Where is everybody?

17:33.261 --> 17:37.182
Uh, most people fled
to the big cities for work.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.392
No kids. No economy.

17:42.270 --> 17:43.313
No kids?

17:50.236 --> 17:52.030
How long will it take to get home?

17:52.072 --> 17:53.239
Home?

17:53.281 --> 17:54.574
- You're taking me home, right?
- No.

17:54.616 --> 17:55.950
But I just wanna go home.

17:56.242 --> 18:00.038
Ruby, I can't take you home.
It's not safe there.

18:01.164 --> 18:02.082
Get down. Get down.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.509
I'm gonna protect you.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.221
How?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.181
Have you heard of the Children's League?

18:18.223 --> 18:19.140
No.

18:19.182 --> 18:21.685
Most people don't realize
the camps are total bullshit,

18:21.726 --> 18:23.603
because the White House keeps flaunting

18:23.645 --> 18:26.314
its reformed children on TV,
including the president's son.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.608
So we started the League

18:28.650 --> 18:30.110
to get you guys out of the camps.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.195
Those on the upper end of the scale,

18:32.237 --> 18:35.073
the Reds and the Oranges,
are considered too dangerous.

18:35.115 --> 18:38.159
Ruby, you are very, very rare.

18:38.660 --> 18:41.371
Among the most powerful
and the least trusted.

18:41.413 --> 18:44.749
Those like you are... killed on sight.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.459
What are you going to do?

18:47.460 --> 18:48.962
If we ever get separated

18:49.004 --> 18:50.672
and you find yourself in danger,

18:50.714 --> 18:52.799
I want you to squeeze this pendant

18:52.841 --> 18:53.842
for three seconds.

18:55.010 --> 18:57.679
It's a tracking device,
but only if you activate it.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.724
And it only goes to me. Okay?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.393
Look, Ruby, you and I both know

19:03.435 --> 19:05.270
how dangerous it is out here.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.565
At some point, it might be really nice

19:08.606 --> 19:10.316
to have someone looking out for you.

19:17.407 --> 19:19.159
<i>And now the president's son,</i>

19:19.200 --> 19:21.286
<i>Clancy Gray, with his message of hope.</i>

19:21.327 --> 19:23.038
<i>If I can be cured, you can be cured.</i>

19:29.613 --> 19:31.629
- We did it.
- I never doubted you for a second.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.006
Wait. Where are your two?

19:33.757 --> 19:37.510
- I couldn't get them out.
- What? So sorry.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.305
Yeah, but I got a lead on a Red.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.557
Oh, Ruby, this is Rob.

19:42.599 --> 19:43.767
It's nice to meet you.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.814
We don't have a ton of time.
And we need you to change, okay?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.400
New clothes, soap, some other things.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.319
The bathroom in the station
still has running water.

19:54.361 --> 19:57.280
But hey. Definitely don't drink it, okay?

20:01.326 --> 20:02.494
Whoa, whoa!

20:04.871 --> 20:06.331
Get back here!

20:08.833 --> 20:10.335
You're not going anywhere.

20:11.419 --> 20:12.420
You okay?

20:15.090 --> 20:16.549
Yeah, uh, I just tripped.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.771
Hey!

21:17.235 --> 21:18.236
Hey!

21:25.660 --> 21:26.786
Please, let me in!

21:26.828 --> 21:28.288
I have nowhere to go. No one to trust.

21:30.331 --> 21:31.499
Please!

21:32.167 --> 21:33.376
Ruby!

21:36.046 --> 21:37.088
Come on!

21:38.548 --> 21:40.175
Please. I think they're trying to kill me.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.641
<i>It was Lady Jane.</i>

21:48.892 --> 21:50.977
I saw her with my own eyes, dude!

21:51.019 --> 21:52.145
Yeah, you're blind.

21:52.187 --> 21:53.521
Let's just focus on finding East River.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.406
Ruby!

22:07.118 --> 22:08.328
- Ruby!
- Ruby!

22:08.370 --> 22:10.205
- Who are these guys?
- Go, go, go.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.641
What happened at the gas station, Zu?

22:29.933 --> 22:31.726
- Did they see you?
- Yeah, and who's Ruby?

22:32.894 --> 22:34.104
I'm Ruby.

22:42.237 --> 22:43.154
Ruby Daly.

22:47.784 --> 22:49.285
What do we always tell you, Zu?

22:49.577 --> 22:50.787
No strays.

22:50.829 --> 22:51.830
Wait, I'll handle this.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.123
Don't worry, I'm leaving.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.836
Wait, did you just come from the camp?

22:57.877 --> 22:59.337
Yeah, they broke me out.

22:59.713 --> 23:01.214
But I'm Green, I'm not a threat.

23:01.256 --> 23:03.675
- "They" being the League?
- Open the freaking door, Liam!

23:03.717 --> 23:05.552
We already got the cops
and the Tracers on our ass,

23:05.593 --> 23:07.387
we don't need to add the League to the list.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.139
What if they put in a call
that there's four kids

23:09.180 --> 23:10.640
cruising around in a beat-up, blue minivan?

23:10.682 --> 23:12.517
Ooh, that's no way to talk about Betty, man.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.562
Excuse me for hurting
the feelings of a Nissan van.

23:16.104 --> 23:17.772
Please, just let me out. I'm really sorry.

23:17.814 --> 23:18.940
You're not going with the League.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.316
What? Liam!

23:21.484 --> 23:23.403
I'm Liam. That's Zu. This is Chubs.

23:24.362 --> 23:25.947
- Chubs?
- Charles to you.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.532
Yeah, he used to be a bit beefier.

23:27.574 --> 23:28.992
Zu can back me up on that one.

23:29.409 --> 23:31.036
Right, Zu? What's wrong?

23:42.797 --> 23:44.966
That's Lady Jane! I told you I saw Lady Jane!

23:45.008 --> 23:45.884
Shit.

23:53.391 --> 23:55.143
Come on, we got to go. Go, go, go. Punch it!

24:01.274 --> 24:02.442
She's crazy!

24:16.581 --> 24:17.707
It's the League, man!

24:18.041 --> 24:19.042
Go, go, go!

24:28.218 --> 24:30.720
Please. You have to let me out
before someone gets hurt.

24:31.179 --> 24:32.639
Liam. Let her out, man.

24:32.681 --> 24:33.640
Shut up, I got this.

24:33.890 --> 24:34.974
- Can you drive?
- No.

24:35.016 --> 24:36.351
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to.

24:36.393 --> 24:38.269
Chubs can't see more than
ten feet in front of his face.

24:38.311 --> 24:39.229
I heard that.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.397
Dude, come on, it's just like a bike.

24:40.438 --> 24:42.565
- Tell me you've ridden a bike.
- Of course I've ridden a bike!

24:42.607 --> 24:43.692
- Come on.
- Don't touch me.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.235
- Come on.
- Okay.

24:45.276 --> 24:46.695
Come on. You got this.

24:54.285 --> 24:55.328
Okay, good. Come on.

24:55.578 --> 24:56.538
We're so dying.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.289
- Keep driving.
- Okay.

25:00.583 --> 25:02.460
- Whoa! You got me?
- Yeah, I got you.

25:09.134 --> 25:10.140
What's he doing?

25:22.188 --> 25:23.940
- Drive faster.
- Okay.

25:32.032 --> 25:33.700
Whatever happens, don't stop.

25:45.587 --> 25:46.463
Rob!

26:02.579 --> 26:03.996
Watch out!

26:14.199 --> 26:15.158
Nice driving.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.912
This is so not like riding a bike.

26:38.223 --> 26:40.100
Do you guys even know where you are?

26:40.642 --> 26:43.103
Don't look so scared. Chubs is a map expert.

26:43.478 --> 26:45.939
I'm Green, so all maps make sense to me.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.107
So does theoretical physics,

26:47.148 --> 26:49.943
existentialism according to Thoreau,
speed chess, artificial intelligence.

26:49.984 --> 26:51.152
Yeah. In short, the kid is smart.

26:51.194 --> 26:53.905
What, you think I rock these geeky-ass
Coke-bottle glasses for show?

26:54.155 --> 26:56.700
Plus, I'm smart enough to know
no one gives a crap about Greens.

26:57.992 --> 26:59.160
So enlighten me,

26:59.202 --> 27:01.871
why the hell would the League
go through all this trouble for you?

27:01.913 --> 27:03.540
What makes you so special?

27:03.957 --> 27:04.916
Chubs, leave her alone.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.793
If we're gonna be stuck
with her, we need to know.

27:06.835 --> 27:08.253
You're not gonna be stuck with me.

27:09.629 --> 27:10.630
I'm going home.

27:12.549 --> 27:13.550
Wait, where is home?

27:14.050 --> 27:15.260
Salem, Virginia.

27:20.390 --> 27:21.558
Hey!

27:21.599 --> 27:22.934
What are you gonna do?

27:22.976 --> 27:24.936
Walk back to the highway and hitchhike?

27:24.978 --> 27:26.271
You'll be nabbed by a Tracer

27:26.312 --> 27:27.814
and back in a camp in time for bed.

27:28.106 --> 27:29.107
A Tracer?

27:29.607 --> 27:30.692
Bounty hunters.

27:31.151 --> 27:32.694
Like that crazy Lady Jane

27:32.736 --> 27:34.279
who nearly smoked our ass back there?

27:34.320 --> 27:36.364
Man, for a Green, she sure
takes a while to catch up.

27:36.865 --> 27:38.950
You should come with us.
We're going to East River.

27:39.409 --> 27:40.452
Don't tell her.

27:40.493 --> 27:43.413
Supposedly, it's this huge compound where
kids can live together on the outside.

27:43.747 --> 27:46.416
There's food, a place to stay, and it's safe.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.126
The Slip Kid's in charge.

27:48.168 --> 27:49.210
Who?

27:49.252 --> 27:50.503
No one knows who he really is.

27:50.545 --> 27:52.839
He got the name because
he slipped custody four times.

27:53.757 --> 27:56.509
And supposedly he's an Orange.

27:56.760 --> 27:57.969
Nice, Liam.

27:58.261 --> 28:01.139
You wanna tell her your shoe size and
your favorite animal while you're at it?

28:04.392 --> 28:05.935
Dinner?

28:06.253 --> 28:08.730
Sweet! It's literally sweet.

28:19.032 --> 28:21.076
We're your best chance of getting home.

28:55.944 --> 28:57.445
If the League was protecting us

28:57.487 --> 29:00.490
from the Tracer shooting at us
then what makes them so bad?

29:00.865 --> 29:02.867
The enemy of my enemy is my friend?

29:03.952 --> 29:06.329
Yeah, like that ever works.

29:06.955 --> 29:10.125
The woman that I met risked
a lot to get me out.

29:10.792 --> 29:11.960
She seemed okay.

29:12.002 --> 29:15.213
Some shady lady kidnaps you, and
you think that's all right?

29:15.255 --> 29:17.090
You were hanging with the wrong people.

29:17.132 --> 29:19.718
Like, did she lure you with candy
from a panel van or something?

29:19.759 --> 29:21.011
You weren't there.

29:21.636 --> 29:23.346
She said that the League wanted to help me.

29:24.389 --> 29:25.849
And I ran away.

29:25.890 --> 29:28.184
But what if I was wrong? What if they can?

29:28.226 --> 29:29.811
You don't want help from the League!

29:30.729 --> 29:31.855
Okay?

29:36.651 --> 29:37.986
All right, come on, Zu.

29:38.319 --> 29:39.738
It's time for math class.

29:45.577 --> 29:47.829
Listen. My brother joined the League first.

29:47.871 --> 29:49.873
And he's always right, so I joined, too.

29:49.914 --> 29:51.833
They just made us so many promises.

29:52.667 --> 29:54.377
Taught us how to use our powers.

29:54.753 --> 29:57.547
At first on little things
like dummies, smaller stuff.

29:57.589 --> 29:59.382
Then they showed us how to break an arm.

30:01.426 --> 30:03.470
I didn't sign up to be a soldier, so I left.

30:04.763 --> 30:06.431
And I'll die before I go back.

30:07.349 --> 30:08.850
They're fighting a war.

30:09.559 --> 30:11.394
Doesn't that require them to be strong?

30:11.436 --> 30:13.104
Strong, yeah. Cruel? Reckless?

30:13.146 --> 30:14.439
No, leave that to the government.

30:14.481 --> 30:16.566
There was nothing cruel about what she did.

30:17.233 --> 30:18.818
She rescued me. She saved my life.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.403
- For what?
- I don't know.

30:20.445 --> 30:22.364
I don't know what's going on.

30:22.739 --> 30:24.282
But for the first time in six years,

30:24.324 --> 30:25.617
someone was nice to me.

30:25.658 --> 30:28.495
So I'm just saying, maybe my experience
was a little different from yours.

30:28.536 --> 30:29.871
So why'd you run away from her?

30:30.538 --> 30:32.332
The League's not your friend, okay?

30:32.957 --> 30:35.085
You made the right choice. Trust me.

30:35.126 --> 30:36.419
Why should I trust you?

30:36.461 --> 30:38.338
Whether you trust me or not, I don't care.

30:38.672 --> 30:42.258
Sooner or later, you're gonna learn
that the only ones who can help us are us.

30:50.750 --> 30:54.771
How could you miss this? Six years,
she roamed free in these hallways.

30:54.813 --> 30:57.691
You have one job to do
and you couldn't even do it.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.902
Obviously you have a problem recognizing

31:00.944 --> 31:02.987
Oranges and Reds when you see one,

31:03.029 --> 31:05.240
so, let's refresh your memory.

31:07.617 --> 31:08.702
Oh...

31:08.743 --> 31:10.245
Let's go, Lieutenant.

31:10.954 --> 31:13.915
These two need time to get reacquainted.

31:14.332 --> 31:16.209
No, no, Captain. Captain, please, don't.

31:16.251 --> 31:17.877
Please. It wasn't my fault!

31:17.919 --> 31:19.654
Captain, don't close that door!

31:22.507 --> 31:23.800
Oh, God, no.

31:27.679 --> 31:28.763
No!

31:28.805 --> 31:30.265
Put a bounty on that girl.

31:30.306 --> 31:31.891
Whatever you need from the war chest.

31:31.933 --> 31:34.602
Every Tracer out there better be after her.

31:38.773 --> 31:40.400
We're gonna need another doctor.

32:11.723 --> 32:12.891
<i>Surprise!</i>

32:12.932 --> 32:14.267
<i>Gudetama!</i>

32:14.309 --> 32:16.686
<i>Don't worry anymore, Mommy and Daddy.</i>

32:16.728 --> 32:18.813
<i>Nothing can take me away from you.</i>

32:20.106 --> 32:22.484
<i>I'm sorry, Mommy, I'm sorry.</i>

32:23.560 --> 32:25.570
Hey, Ruby, you all right?

32:29.032 --> 32:30.408
What do you want?

32:30.450 --> 32:31.951
Nothing, I just, uh...

32:32.869 --> 32:33.995
I just wanted to give you these.

32:34.371 --> 32:35.497
A peace offering.

32:36.122 --> 32:37.123
Aren't they yours?

32:37.374 --> 32:39.417
Yeah, no. I have a couple of extra pairs.

32:39.459 --> 32:41.336
And, uh, you don't.

32:41.795 --> 32:42.921
Just take them.

32:42.962 --> 32:44.422
Chubs says your extremities or whatever

32:44.464 --> 32:46.216
are the first things to get cold.

32:47.092 --> 32:48.551
It's spring, so...

32:49.552 --> 32:50.679
Yeah.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.222
Yeah. But, you know, you're all...

32:53.848 --> 32:56.351
You need them. This way you won't...

32:57.477 --> 32:58.478
die.

32:58.728 --> 33:01.272
Oh, God. Ruby, just take the damn socks

33:01.314 --> 33:02.649
and put him out of his misery.

33:02.691 --> 33:03.817
Shut up, Chubs.

33:03.858 --> 33:05.985
You got a way with the ladies, Liam.

33:06.653 --> 33:08.571
You gotta teach me your moves someday, pal.

33:11.533 --> 33:13.243
I'm just going to leave them there.

33:13.284 --> 33:15.078
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

33:15.912 --> 33:17.038
Hey, Liam?

33:17.497 --> 33:18.623
Yes?

33:20.125 --> 33:21.209
Thank you.

33:24.087 --> 33:25.088
Yeah.

34:54.469 --> 34:55.844
Zu. Hey, Zu.

34:56.304 --> 34:57.305
It's just a dream.

34:57.931 --> 34:59.933
Come here. I got you.

35:01.101 --> 35:02.268
I got you.

35:02.894 --> 35:04.145
Go back to sleep.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.147
Okay.

35:07.732 --> 35:08.817
All right?

35:17.575 --> 35:19.077
Are you okay, Zu?

35:23.039 --> 35:24.082
Okay.

35:47.439 --> 35:50.817
Oh, no. I'm really not
a fancy dress kinda girl.

35:54.487 --> 35:55.697
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:01.453 --> 36:02.746
Where'd you get that?

36:02.787 --> 36:04.289
It's stupid.

36:05.665 --> 36:07.417
No, no. It's, uh...

36:08.335 --> 36:10.754
It's been a while since
I've seen a girl in a dress.

36:11.838 --> 36:13.548
Or anyone in a dress.

36:15.133 --> 36:17.177
I feel like I should
ask you to prom or something.

36:17.510 --> 36:20.472
Well, unfortunately, I'm already going with

36:20.513 --> 36:22.599
the captain of the football team, so...

36:25.226 --> 36:26.269
Conner Jenkins?

36:26.853 --> 36:28.980
Did you just make that name up?

36:29.562 --> 36:32.525
No, Conner Jenkins was at Caledonia with me.

36:32.567 --> 36:33.610
He was an idiot, though.

36:35.737 --> 36:38.907
Well, in that case, gotta dump him.

36:40.658 --> 36:41.576
Oh.

36:42.077 --> 36:43.828
So you're saying I have a shot?

36:47.165 --> 36:48.667
Why don't we start with scraping

36:48.708 --> 36:49.959
these letters off this minivan

36:50.001 --> 36:51.753
and then we'll see where it goes from there?

36:52.295 --> 36:53.380
Deal.

36:56.461 --> 36:58.718
So do you always carry a cocktail dress
when you're on the run?

36:59.928 --> 37:01.513
No, Zu gave it to me.

37:01.888 --> 37:03.139
She likes you.

37:04.432 --> 37:06.434
Careful, though.
She needs girl time so bad...

37:06.476 --> 37:08.878
I think she might turn you into
her own personal dress-up doll.

37:12.440 --> 37:13.608
Tracers.

37:26.371 --> 37:28.331
Come on, let's just go.

37:33.169 --> 37:34.796
Wait, what just happened?

37:34.838 --> 37:36.481
I don't know.

37:46.224 --> 37:50.270
<i>And now the president's son,
Clancy Gray, with his message of hope.</i>

37:50.311 --> 37:52.397
<i>If I can be cured, you can be cured.</i>

37:52.439 --> 37:54.274
Wonder king, Clancy Gray.

37:55.233 --> 37:57.736
"If I can be cured, you can be cured."

37:57.777 --> 37:59.779
You had those stupid posters, too?

37:59.821 --> 38:01.489
Seven shades of bullshit.

38:01.531 --> 38:02.699
That's right.

38:04.117 --> 38:07.287
You gotta stop drawing the cats
all over the nines and sixes.

38:12.292 --> 38:14.085
She needs her numbers.

38:14.544 --> 38:15.754
You have to learn.

38:18.298 --> 38:19.799
So why are we at the mall?

38:21.301 --> 38:23.303
Somebody's got to get supplies, right?

38:32.437 --> 38:33.438
Zu.

38:34.105 --> 38:35.357
Would you do the honors?

38:43.490 --> 38:45.442
Let's go shopping.

38:51.373 --> 38:52.574
You like this?

39:55.562 --> 39:56.771
Whoa!

40:00.650 --> 40:02.444
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

40:05.780 --> 40:07.282
Whoa!

40:14.289 --> 40:15.331
Stop!

40:15.623 --> 40:16.624
Whoa!

41:00.585 --> 41:01.711
Hey, hey, hey.

41:02.337 --> 41:03.963
- They're just kids.
- Hey, what the hell?

41:04.589 --> 41:06.091
You could have been Tracers.

41:06.716 --> 41:09.135
We're here for supplies.
We're not looking for trouble.

41:09.177 --> 41:12.681
Look. No hard feelings. We're sorry.

41:13.348 --> 41:14.641
We can give you some food,

41:14.683 --> 41:16.601
and you can sleep here tonight.

41:16.643 --> 41:17.560
What?

41:17.602 --> 41:19.396
But only tonight.

41:21.314 --> 41:23.483
Last week we scored five pallets
of fresh produce

41:23.525 --> 41:24.776
off a delivery truck.

41:25.026 --> 41:26.277
What do you do with all of it?

41:26.319 --> 41:27.821
I mean, it's only four of you guys.

41:27.862 --> 41:29.781
We do the work that needs to be done.

41:29.823 --> 41:31.908
We're the arms and legs of a greater cause.

41:32.742 --> 41:34.077
Wait, do you know him?

41:34.661 --> 41:37.038
- Know him?
- Yeah, the Slip Kid.

41:37.080 --> 41:39.207
Nah, nobody really knows the Slip Kid.

41:39.249 --> 41:40.583
We're trying to find his camp.

41:40.625 --> 41:41.751
East River?

41:41.793 --> 41:43.753
- So it's real?
- Sure.

41:45.755 --> 41:47.716
- Where is it?
- I can't tell you.

41:48.508 --> 41:50.510
Come on, dude, you got to be
shittin' me, man! Come on!

41:50.552 --> 41:52.721
They call it a secret for a reason, pal.

41:52.762 --> 41:54.347
It's one of the Slip Kid's rules.

41:54.389 --> 41:55.724
One hundred percent secrecy.

41:55.765 --> 41:57.559
It's the only way he can keep
all the kids safe.

42:05.191 --> 42:07.360
Do you think that we've survived this

42:07.402 --> 42:09.195
by following the rules?

42:09.237 --> 42:11.781
Look, we're not just a bunch of dead weight.

42:17.704 --> 42:19.080
We're powerful.

42:19.122 --> 42:20.749
And we're useful.

42:21.249 --> 42:24.836
The Slip Kid would be lucky to have us.

42:26.004 --> 42:27.130
E.D.O.

42:27.172 --> 42:28.590
Wait, what?

42:29.299 --> 42:30.592
Dude, that is not cool!

42:30.633 --> 42:31.634
What's E.D.O.?

42:32.052 --> 42:33.511
That's all you get.

42:33.928 --> 42:34.929
E.D.O.

42:37.265 --> 42:39.476
"All the world will be your enemy.

42:39.517 --> 42:41.728
Prince with a thousand enemies.

42:41.770 --> 42:44.689
And whenever they catch you,
they will kill you,

42:45.106 --> 42:47.776
but first they must catch you.

42:48.318 --> 42:51.529
Digger, listener, runner.

42:52.113 --> 42:53.907
Prince with a swift warning.

42:54.949 --> 42:57.660
Be cunning and full of tricks

42:58.244 --> 43:01.164
and your people shall never be destroyed."

43:06.002 --> 43:07.253
Go to sleep.

43:27.857 --> 43:29.150
Hey, Chubs.

43:29.734 --> 43:30.860
It's Charles.

43:30.902 --> 43:31.903
Charles.

43:34.906 --> 43:35.907
What are you doing?

43:44.040 --> 43:45.500
I was afraid they might steal Betty.

43:45.959 --> 43:47.752
Nice work getting that clue, by the way.

43:48.294 --> 43:49.462
How'd you do that?

43:50.255 --> 43:51.881
I just asked.

43:53.133 --> 43:56.678
Okay, so, have you figured out
what E.D.O. means?

43:57.526 --> 43:58.938
I have guesses.

43:59.514 --> 44:00.974
I tried Greek, Sumerian

44:01.016 --> 44:03.893
or corresponding placements
in all major alphabets. Nothing.

44:04.644 --> 44:05.812
I even tried pictographs,

44:05.854 --> 44:07.355
and Chinese military call signs

44:07.397 --> 44:09.482
and sign language. Zip.

44:09.524 --> 44:11.943
There's nothing that leads
to a spot on the map.

44:11.985 --> 44:14.029
Why are you writing book reports?

44:14.320 --> 44:15.739
They're not book reports.

44:23.872 --> 44:25.957
"I'm out. Can't get to you.

44:26.249 --> 44:29.878
Can meet anywhere, name place
and time. Missed you.

44:29.919 --> 44:31.046
Love you."

44:31.087 --> 44:33.631
It's how I got in contact
with my parents when I was in hiding.

44:34.591 --> 44:37.552
I posted reviews online with messages.

44:37.594 --> 44:39.763
Your parents must be
really worried about you.

44:41.973 --> 44:44.684
My dad's a doctor.
He saw everything firsthand.

44:47.145 --> 44:48.605
I'm sure he thinks I'm dead.

44:55.695 --> 44:58.073
My dad's a police detective, so...

44:58.907 --> 45:00.575
he saw everything, too.

45:11.711 --> 45:12.837
Police band.

45:15.048 --> 45:16.549
Wait. What?

45:17.258 --> 45:20.428
Well, think about it, I mean, police
can talk to each other on frequencies

45:20.470 --> 45:21.596
only they can listen to.

45:21.638 --> 45:23.348
Like UHF, VHF.

45:23.723 --> 45:24.808
You know kids under 17

45:24.849 --> 45:26.142
can hear frequencies adults can't.

45:26.768 --> 45:29.688
That's why the white noise
works on us and not on them.

45:29.729 --> 45:33.400
What if E.D.O. isn't a place,
but a frequency?

45:35.151 --> 45:36.152
Okay.

45:36.861 --> 45:38.279
But frequencies are numbers.

45:39.406 --> 45:43.118
E is 5, D is 4, and O is 15.

45:43.159 --> 45:44.703
But... That doesn't work.

45:44.744 --> 45:46.830
Well, O could just mean, like, zero.

45:47.831 --> 45:50.166
Five, four, zero. Five, four, zero.

45:51.710 --> 45:52.794
Got it.

46:04.431 --> 46:06.558
<i>If you can hear this, you're one of us.</i>

46:06.975 --> 46:10.020
<i>If you're one of us, you can find us.</i>

46:10.061 --> 46:12.022
<i>Lake Prince, Virginia.</i>

46:13.314 --> 46:16.184
<i>If you can hear this, you're one of us.</i>

46:16.226 --> 46:18.903
<i>If you're one of us, you can find us.</i>

46:19.362 --> 46:20.363
Charles!

46:21.489 --> 46:22.824
You did it!

46:24.743 --> 46:28.170
- It's Chubs to you.
- <i>If you're one of us, you can find us.</i>

46:32.751 --> 46:35.337
All right. So, we're going
to take the next exit

46:35.378 --> 46:37.839
and a straight shot.

46:37.881 --> 46:38.882
Got it.

46:40.050 --> 46:41.259
To Lake Prince?

46:44.346 --> 46:45.722
It's to your house.

46:46.431 --> 46:47.724
We're taking you home.

47:11.915 --> 47:12.916
Are you sure about this?

47:16.378 --> 47:17.504
Yeah.

47:19.172 --> 47:20.215
No.

47:33.269 --> 47:35.146
So if your parents are there I guess...

47:35.980 --> 47:37.232
I guess this is it.

47:37.691 --> 47:39.317
Yeah, I guess we'll see.

47:46.366 --> 47:48.451
Don't take any candy from strangers.

47:51.454 --> 47:52.664
Thank you.

47:54.374 --> 47:55.375
Yeah.

48:19.482 --> 48:23.278
<i>For six years, all I wanted was to see them.</i>

48:26.197 --> 48:27.991
<i>But looking through the window now...</i>

48:30.243 --> 48:31.870
<i>everything feels wrong.</i>

48:34.414 --> 48:37.167
<i>I know what would happen if I went in there.</i>

48:39.419 --> 48:41.129
<i>They wouldn't remember me.</i>

48:43.673 --> 48:45.342
<i>I'd be a stranger.</i>

48:50.138 --> 48:51.389
<i>It was my fault.</i>

48:54.309 --> 48:55.852
<i>And because of what I did...</i>

48:57.687 --> 48:59.147
<i>they lost their daughter.</i>

49:01.691 --> 49:03.526
<i>And I lost my family.</i>

49:44.275 --> 49:45.652
You dropped this back there.

49:46.986 --> 49:48.238
I don't want it.

49:50.824 --> 49:51.950
You're lying.

49:57.330 --> 49:59.874
You know, Ruby, you're not
the only one who's lost someone.

50:01.543 --> 50:02.961
We've all been here.

50:04.838 --> 50:06.172
So take this.

50:06.840 --> 50:07.924
This, uh...

50:08.842 --> 50:09.843
What is this?

50:16.808 --> 50:19.561
It's a birthday present from my dad.

50:21.146 --> 50:22.939
It's the last thing he gave me.

50:26.568 --> 50:28.653
It used to make me feel like I wasn't alone.

50:28.695 --> 50:30.280
Hey, you're not alone.

50:33.366 --> 50:36.077
I mean, we're all pretty much orphans.

50:38.329 --> 50:39.497
We have each other.

50:40.957 --> 50:42.500
It's kind of like a family.

50:43.835 --> 50:45.545
A dysfunctional family, but...

50:47.964 --> 50:50.216
that's as good as you're
gonna get these days, right?

50:53.470 --> 50:54.512
Right.

51:12.864 --> 51:13.948
Sorry.

51:20.455 --> 51:21.664
It's okay.

51:22.624 --> 51:24.084
One of these days, you're gonna tell me

51:24.125 --> 51:25.377
all about you, Ruby Daly.

51:25.919 --> 51:28.505
And I can't wait to hear that story.

51:28.838 --> 51:29.881
Until then...

51:30.423 --> 51:33.593
Zu saved some Twinkies for you.

51:34.052 --> 51:35.053
Come on.

51:48.949 --> 51:50.367
Hey, Liam.

51:54.989 --> 51:58.076
I love that kids can
hear frequencies adults can't.

51:59.744 --> 52:02.230
There is some good in getting old, after all.

52:06.334 --> 52:08.253
Took you long enough, Lady Jane.

52:08.294 --> 52:10.380
Are they gonna dock you
for slacking on the job?

52:10.422 --> 52:13.800
You alone fetch 150,000, baby.
You should be proud.

52:14.134 --> 52:15.218
You've gone up in price

52:15.260 --> 52:16.970
since the last time I snagged you.

52:17.012 --> 52:18.013
What'd you do?

52:18.722 --> 52:20.181
Start another revolution?

52:20.515 --> 52:22.142
Just let them go, and you can have me.

52:22.642 --> 52:24.352
I promise I won't give you any trouble.

52:26.229 --> 52:27.939
That's a very generous offer, Liam,

52:27.981 --> 52:29.983
but considering I'm the one with a gun,

52:30.025 --> 52:31.276
I think I'm gonna pass.

52:33.622 --> 52:34.863
Who's the little lady?

52:36.865 --> 52:37.991
You first, little girl. Come on.

52:50.211 --> 52:51.296
Drop it.

52:53.006 --> 52:54.007
And the keys.

52:57.594 --> 52:59.262
Say you're sorry to Zu.

53:01.389 --> 53:02.766
I'm sorry, Zu.

53:03.725 --> 53:04.601
Now...

53:06.102 --> 53:08.229
you're gonna walk into that forest...

53:10.982 --> 53:12.400
and you're gonna keep walking.

53:13.443 --> 53:18.323
No matter how tired or how hungry you get...

53:19.824 --> 53:20.992
keep walking.

53:22.077 --> 53:24.287
Don't stop.

53:24.913 --> 53:25.914
Ever.

53:26.748 --> 53:27.624
Ever.

53:50.355 --> 53:52.273
Just hear me out. I don't want to ditch her.

53:52.315 --> 53:53.650
I know what's better for us.

53:53.692 --> 53:55.110
- Why?
- Because I'm a Green!

53:55.151 --> 53:56.486
I can bank on that fact.

53:56.528 --> 53:57.904
It's too dangerous with her around.

53:57.946 --> 54:00.573
If we keep driving with her,
they're gonna find us.

54:01.449 --> 54:03.660
Look, man, you're getting way
too sentimental about this.

54:03.702 --> 54:05.245
I get it. You have to move on.

54:05.286 --> 54:06.871
You don't know her, okay?

54:06.913 --> 54:08.748
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.

54:08.790 --> 54:11.084
This is the right way to go. You know it.

54:11.126 --> 54:12.377
You just don't want to part with her.

54:12.794 --> 54:15.046
- But it's the best decision.
- So why are we doing it?

54:15.088 --> 54:17.173
I don't want to leave her.
I don't want to just dump her.

54:17.215 --> 54:18.883
We're being watched heavily all the time.

54:18.925 --> 54:20.010
Hey, I'm just gonna go.

54:20.510 --> 54:22.262
So, you can stop fighting.

54:22.971 --> 54:26.224
And I'm really sorry that I lied to you.

54:30.103 --> 54:31.229
Ruby.

54:34.774 --> 54:36.776
- Ruby.
- I just forgot my bag, okay?

54:36.818 --> 54:38.236
We were talking about damn Betty,

54:38.278 --> 54:39.487
not your Orange ass.

54:40.739 --> 54:41.865
And for the record,

54:42.157 --> 54:44.075
I knew you were Orange since day zero.

54:47.203 --> 54:48.413
Sit down.

54:52.542 --> 54:56.171
I just... didn't want you to be afraid of me.

54:57.005 --> 54:59.299
There's nothing wrong with being Orange.

54:59.799 --> 55:01.384
I can't even control it.

55:02.927 --> 55:06.056
I'm trying to figure it out,
but it just happens.

55:06.097 --> 55:07.682
Sometimes all it takes is my skin

55:07.724 --> 55:09.642
brushing up against someone else

55:09.934 --> 55:11.561
and I'm in their head.

55:12.270 --> 55:14.022
And the more that I try to pull free,

55:14.064 --> 55:16.441
the more damage that I do.

55:16.483 --> 55:17.359
Damage?

55:25.116 --> 55:27.202
Is that why you didn't wanna kiss me?

55:28.161 --> 55:29.245
Yeah.

55:32.374 --> 55:33.375
Okay.

55:33.958 --> 55:36.419
Well, touching as this moment is, uh,

55:36.670 --> 55:38.254
we have a Slip Kid to party with, right?

55:38.296 --> 55:39.339
- We do, yeah.
- Let's go.

55:39.381 --> 55:41.091
Yeah, we're not far now. Hey, Zu.

55:41.132 --> 55:42.842
We're packing up.

55:44.344 --> 55:45.428
Gotta go.

55:45.762 --> 55:48.014
Unless you wanna try and run away again.

55:48.056 --> 55:49.057
No.

55:49.349 --> 55:50.642
I'll keep trying to stop you.

55:51.017 --> 55:52.185
Come on.

55:57.732 --> 55:59.943
Ah, it feels like we should
do something for her.

56:01.069 --> 56:03.947
Like a barge out to sea. Set her on fire.

56:05.573 --> 56:06.741
Blaze of glory.

56:07.534 --> 56:08.868
She's a minivan...

56:09.703 --> 56:10.787
not a Viking.

56:31.641 --> 56:32.642
Man.

57:00.712 --> 57:02.672
I don't know, Chubs. It doesn't feel right.

57:03.298 --> 57:05.467
Man, y'all are just a bunch
of negative nellies.

57:10.263 --> 57:11.431
Check it, man.

57:16.102 --> 57:18.897
E. D. O.

57:20.023 --> 57:21.858
- E.D.O.
- E.D.O., man.

57:21.900 --> 57:23.026
Oh, my God.

57:23.985 --> 57:25.737
All right, let's go!

57:32.118 --> 57:33.703
Stay on your knees!

57:35.080 --> 57:36.581
Head to the ground!

57:38.124 --> 57:39.959
- Hey, we're not armed.
- Save it, asshole.

57:40.001 --> 57:41.211
Hold on.

57:41.920 --> 57:42.796
Liam Stewart?

57:45.048 --> 57:47.133
- Mike?
- Everybody, stand down.

57:48.176 --> 57:50.178
Jesus. I'm sorry, Liam.
I didn't know it was you.

57:50.220 --> 57:51.304
It's okay.

57:52.013 --> 57:53.348
Wait, I thought you were with Josh?

57:53.390 --> 57:54.391
I was.

57:54.641 --> 57:55.934
I made it through the fields.

57:56.935 --> 57:58.061
Thanks to you.

58:00.563 --> 58:02.691
- Wait, are you looking for...
- You found it.

58:04.150 --> 58:05.360
Welcome home.

58:05.402 --> 58:07.862
Finally! I told you, man.

58:07.904 --> 58:09.197
Told you!

58:12.409 --> 58:13.451
This is it.

58:23.545 --> 58:24.546
Come on, guys.

58:26.798 --> 58:28.758
Everyone looks so happy here.

58:28.800 --> 58:31.011
Yeah, we don't segregate by colors here.

58:31.052 --> 58:34.889
We respect our differences,
but we're all the same.

58:35.223 --> 58:37.017
Now, let's go.

58:37.475 --> 58:38.977
It's time to meet the Slip Kid.

58:53.533 --> 58:55.368
You gotta be kidding me!

58:55.744 --> 58:56.786
Clancy Gray?

58:57.162 --> 58:58.997
I knew you weren't reformed.

59:01.291 --> 59:02.667
You're Charles, right?

59:04.336 --> 59:06.504
And you must be Suzume. Hey.

59:08.840 --> 59:09.924
And Liam Stewart.

59:10.300 --> 59:12.844
The hero who broke
a hundred kids out of Caledonia.

59:14.637 --> 59:15.930
Ruby Daly.

59:15.972 --> 59:17.807
The last remaining Orange other than me.

59:18.350 --> 59:19.642
It's an honor to meet you.

59:19.976 --> 59:22.687
I'm honestly excited to meet all of you guys.

59:22.729 --> 59:24.397
I mean, you're kind of legendary.

59:24.439 --> 59:25.732
You're so welcome.

59:27.442 --> 59:29.110
Now, there's a lot to be done here

59:29.152 --> 59:31.654
and we could really use your guys' help.

59:32.280 --> 59:34.657
I'm thinking cabin 18.

59:35.116 --> 59:36.076
Yes, sir.

59:36.117 --> 59:37.410
Go get settled.

59:37.452 --> 59:39.079
We're gonna have some fun tonight.

59:39.120 --> 59:40.246
Bye.

59:57.013 --> 59:59.265
Wow, floating lanterns.

59:59.427 --> 01:00:00.892
This is like Hogwarts.

01:00:00.934 --> 01:00:02.060
Yeah.

01:00:05.355 --> 01:00:07.482
Oh, wait, that would make you Harry, right?

01:00:08.608 --> 01:00:14.072
And me Hermione or Ginny Weasley, right?

01:00:15.407 --> 01:00:16.574
Probably.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.093
Well, Harry and Ginny end up together.

01:00:19.135 --> 01:00:20.829
Yeah.

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:24.416
Oh, no, I didn't mean...

01:00:26.418 --> 01:00:27.627
You know what?

01:00:28.211 --> 01:00:29.796
I really like them together.

01:00:39.514 --> 01:00:40.932
We should dance.

01:00:42.392 --> 01:00:44.144
- No.
- Yeah.

01:00:44.185 --> 01:00:45.353
- No.
- No?

01:00:56.406 --> 01:00:57.782
It's okay, I won't hurt you.

01:00:57.824 --> 01:00:58.950
I know.

01:00:58.992 --> 01:01:00.702
Oh, that's right, you're the mind reader.

01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:02.412
I can't read minds.

01:01:02.454 --> 01:01:04.706
I can barely understand my own thoughts.

01:01:19.929 --> 01:01:21.181
You're really beautiful.

01:01:21.931 --> 01:01:23.141
What?

01:01:23.183 --> 01:01:26.353
I just said you're...
You're really beautiful.

01:02:10.522 --> 01:02:11.690
Clancy?

01:02:11.731 --> 01:02:12.732
Come in!

01:02:22.158 --> 01:02:23.159
Hey.

01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:25.120
Hi.

01:02:26.996 --> 01:02:28.957
Mike didn't give me a work assignment

01:02:28.998 --> 01:02:30.875
and said to come and see you, so...

01:02:30.917 --> 01:02:32.502
You do have a work assignment.

01:02:33.712 --> 01:02:34.963
Well, what is it?

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.506
You're gonna work with me.

01:02:37.924 --> 01:02:40.552
Please. There's something I need to show you.

01:02:42.137 --> 01:02:43.263
Come on.

01:02:51.688 --> 01:02:53.940
I was one of the first survivors.

01:02:53.982 --> 01:02:56.200
<i>They used me as their test monkey.</i>

01:02:56.901 --> 01:02:58.737
<i>Trying to find a cure that didn't exist.</i>

01:02:59.237 --> 01:03:00.447
Dad!

01:03:00.488 --> 01:03:02.490
<i>My father didn't care. He sanctioned it.</i>

01:03:02.949 --> 01:03:05.118
<i>When the doctors came up empty-handed,</i>

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.413
<i>my father just said I was cured.</i>

01:03:08.455 --> 01:03:11.499
- Please, stop!
- <i>I knew I wasn't cured.</i>

01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:13.918
<i>He wouldn't listen.</i>

01:03:15.295 --> 01:03:16.796
<i>I lost my family.</i>

01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:19.007
Dad!

01:03:19.299 --> 01:03:20.759
<i>I lost everything.</i>

01:03:23.678 --> 01:03:25.638
But if he knows we can't be fixed...

01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:28.016
He'll never stop trying to fix us.

01:03:28.058 --> 01:03:29.100
Why?

01:03:29.142 --> 01:03:30.560
Because he's afraid of us.

01:03:30.602 --> 01:03:32.604
Maybe he has a reason to be.

01:03:33.188 --> 01:03:35.857
Never be ashamed of who you are, Ruby.

01:03:37.192 --> 01:03:39.027
Now, I know how scary it is...

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.697
to not be able to touch someone.

01:03:43.406 --> 01:03:44.949
To never be able to go home.

01:03:46.785 --> 01:03:48.745
But I can show you how to use your strengths

01:03:48.787 --> 01:03:50.163
the way they're meant to be used.

01:03:51.915 --> 01:03:53.249
How to control them.

01:03:55.251 --> 01:03:56.836
Otherwise they control you.

01:03:58.588 --> 01:04:00.048
And I won't hurt anyone?

01:04:01.508 --> 01:04:02.926
Not unless you want to.

01:04:06.638 --> 01:04:07.847
Teach me.

01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:11.643
<i>Everyone has a place in the world.</i>

01:04:12.977 --> 01:04:15.063
<i>A responsibility. A purpose.</i>

01:04:16.147 --> 01:04:18.024
<i>Here, you can discover what that is.</i>

01:04:19.192 --> 01:04:21.861
<i>Learning how to use your power
is just the beginning.</i>

01:04:22.862 --> 01:04:24.698
<i>Learning to use it for a cause...</i>

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:27.742
<i>that's what I'll teach you.</i>

01:04:28.159 --> 01:04:29.828
Okay, now, without touching me,

01:04:29.869 --> 01:04:31.538
and without saying a word...

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.415
put a thought into my head.

01:04:35.542 --> 01:04:36.710
Okay.

01:04:37.127 --> 01:04:38.128
Focus.

01:04:39.004 --> 01:04:40.255
Concentrate.

01:04:42.465 --> 01:04:43.717
Try harder.

01:04:45.427 --> 01:04:46.720
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

01:04:47.345 --> 01:04:48.388
It takes time.

01:04:48.972 --> 01:04:50.098
Go again.

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.141
Okay.

01:04:53.476 --> 01:04:56.187
<i>All of us have lost families.</i>

01:04:57.188 --> 01:04:58.356
<i>Homes.</i>

01:04:59.357 --> 01:05:00.567
<i>Childhood.</i>

01:05:02.027 --> 01:05:03.303
<i>We can get them back.</i>

01:05:05.238 --> 01:05:08.033
<i>And you and I were brought
together for a reason.</i>

01:05:08.366 --> 01:05:10.368
<i>We're the only ones strong enough</i>

01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:12.328
<i>to create a better place for all of us.</i>

01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:14.622
Sorry, but no one can leave right now.

01:05:16.124 --> 01:05:19.169
<i>Where we don't have to be afraid.</i>

01:05:21.338 --> 01:05:24.090
<i>Where no one can take away what's ours.</i>

01:05:24.758 --> 01:05:27.344
You can't control something that scares you.

01:05:28.762 --> 01:05:30.805
The fear's always gonna get in the way.

01:05:31.348 --> 01:05:33.475
- Let's try again.
- Okay.

01:05:33.516 --> 01:05:34.768
Just like I taught you.

01:05:36.227 --> 01:05:37.395
But first...

01:05:38.396 --> 01:05:40.148
<i>you need to be stronger.</i>

01:05:40.815 --> 01:05:44.069
<i>You need to be able
to fight beside me as an equal.</i>

01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:47.280
<i>Only then can we change
what's in everyone's minds.</i>

01:05:47.322 --> 01:05:50.075
Man, you just don't pull
the pepper right off the plant.

01:05:50.116 --> 01:05:51.576
<i>And give us a future.</i>

01:05:51.618 --> 01:05:53.912
Which is why you have janky,
ripped-up peppers.

01:05:54.245 --> 01:05:56.456
And wouldn't you rather have
red peppers anyways?

01:05:56.498 --> 01:05:58.041
I mean, they're high on vitamin C.

01:05:58.083 --> 01:05:59.668
We don't have a choice, you idiot.

01:05:59.709 --> 01:06:00.752
These are green peppers.

01:06:00.794 --> 01:06:02.087
- Now it's your turn.
- Really?

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:04.464
Red peppers and green peppers
are the same thing, dipshit.

01:06:04.506 --> 01:06:06.466
Listen, I'm the garden guy.

01:06:06.508 --> 01:06:09.260
I know what vegetables grow in this garden.

01:06:09.302 --> 01:06:10.553
And if I woulda...

01:06:12.972 --> 01:06:14.224
You're right.

01:06:14.641 --> 01:06:17.519
We should really wait for these
to mature into red peppers.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.604
We need all the vitamin C we can get.

01:06:29.239 --> 01:06:30.323
Well done.

01:06:38.707 --> 01:06:41.042
<i>Ruby, you're still holding back.</i>

01:06:41.793 --> 01:06:43.628
Why are you so afraid of who you are?

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.506
What happened?

01:06:47.757 --> 01:06:49.718
I've never told anyone.

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:51.594
Of course you haven't.

01:06:52.178 --> 01:06:54.055
Only another Orange could understand.

01:06:55.223 --> 01:06:56.474
<i>Let me in.</i>

01:06:57.308 --> 01:06:58.643
<i>You can't hurt me.</i>

01:07:05.316 --> 01:07:06.401
It's okay.

01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:14.659
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

01:07:15.326 --> 01:07:16.453
Gudetama!

01:07:16.494 --> 01:07:17.495
Surprise!

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:25.712
Don't worry anymore, Mommy and Daddy.

01:07:34.387 --> 01:07:36.014
<i>Gudetama!</i>

01:07:36.598 --> 01:07:38.308
<i>Mommy, what's wrong?</i>

01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:40.060
I am not your mommy.

01:07:43.313 --> 01:07:44.564
You erased yourself.

01:07:45.774 --> 01:07:46.900
Yes.

01:07:47.233 --> 01:07:49.527
I didn't want them to worry about me.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.113
And so, I guess I just...

01:07:55.367 --> 01:07:57.160
I took away me.

01:07:58.578 --> 01:07:59.704
I was just a little kid.

01:07:59.746 --> 01:08:02.082
I had no clue what I was doing.

01:08:03.249 --> 01:08:05.418
I just wish I could fix it.

01:08:05.752 --> 01:08:07.337
You have a gift.

01:08:08.546 --> 01:08:10.256
Beyond mine.

01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:13.635
I don't know how to do what you've done,

01:08:13.677 --> 01:08:15.095
let alone reverse it.

01:08:16.095 --> 01:08:17.389
But we'll figure it out.

01:08:17.846 --> 01:08:19.057
Together.

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:23.395
What?

01:08:27.064 --> 01:08:29.484
I have just never met someone like you.

01:08:32.696 --> 01:08:34.197
Someone like me.

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.085
Hey, Ruby.

01:08:52.506 --> 01:08:53.508
Hey.

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:55.301
How was it?

01:08:55.343 --> 01:08:57.636
Um... Intense.

01:08:59.346 --> 01:09:00.724
You two are getting pretty close.

01:09:01.099 --> 01:09:02.225
What does that mean?

01:09:02.475 --> 01:09:04.310
Why couldn't you tell me the truth?

01:09:05.812 --> 01:09:07.063
Why are you so scared of me?

01:09:07.104 --> 01:09:08.606
I'm not scared of you.

01:09:08.648 --> 01:09:09.983
I'm trying not to hurt you.

01:09:10.024 --> 01:09:12.569
Ruby, I don't care if our skin touches,
and you know everything about me.

01:09:12.609 --> 01:09:15.279
I don't want to do to you
what I did to my parents.

01:09:15.321 --> 01:09:16.448
No. I'm never gonna forget you!

01:09:16.488 --> 01:09:17.657
You can't make that promise, Liam.

01:09:17.698 --> 01:09:18.825
You can't help me.

01:09:18.867 --> 01:09:21.161
You're not an Orange. We're not the same.

01:09:28.292 --> 01:09:29.336
Wait, Liam.

01:09:40.846 --> 01:09:41.973
Liam!

01:09:59.282 --> 01:10:00.408
Hey.

01:10:01.743 --> 01:10:03.578
Wow. You caught me staring at a lake.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.789
I've officially become my grandma.

01:10:11.544 --> 01:10:12.754
So what's going on?

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:14.506
Nothing.

01:10:15.965 --> 01:10:20.178
Things are just getting
a little... weird around here.

01:10:21.596 --> 01:10:22.722
Yeah.

01:10:24.724 --> 01:10:26.851
Kinda wish we were all back in the van.

01:10:28.852 --> 01:10:31.731
Tell me about it. This place is horrible.

01:10:33.108 --> 01:10:35.235
We're told when to eat, when to sleep...

01:10:36.027 --> 01:10:37.445
and we're forced to work.

01:10:38.363 --> 01:10:41.032
How is this place
any different from the camps?

01:10:41.074 --> 01:10:42.450
Where else would we go?

01:10:43.618 --> 01:10:44.661
Home.

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.706
Home? Really?

01:10:47.747 --> 01:10:49.165
At least I'd be with my books.

01:10:49.749 --> 01:10:51.835
My dog, if... If he's still around.

01:10:52.419 --> 01:10:53.670
My parents.

01:11:18.987 --> 01:11:19.988
Hey, Clancy?

01:11:21.614 --> 01:11:24.826
I was wondering if
I could ask you for a favor.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.036
Sure.

01:11:26.661 --> 01:11:29.039
Okay, so, I was hoping that you could let

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.082
Chubs use your computer

01:11:31.374 --> 01:11:33.001
to contact his parents. He's done it before.

01:11:33.043 --> 01:11:34.794
It's very safe and coded.

01:11:34.836 --> 01:11:36.713
- He just needs access...
- No. I'm sorry.

01:11:36.755 --> 01:11:38.256
He just wants to contact his parents

01:11:38.298 --> 01:11:39.674
and let them know that he's okay.

01:11:39.924 --> 01:11:42.260
I mean, it's obvious he's
not a fan of this place,

01:11:42.302 --> 01:11:44.804
I don't doubt for a second
that he'd tell his parents our location.

01:11:44.846 --> 01:11:45.889
He's not stupid.

01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:48.308
He's, like, the smartest person
I've ever met.

01:11:51.311 --> 01:11:52.270
All right.

01:11:53.396 --> 01:11:56.191
- Really?
- But first, you teach me.

01:11:57.359 --> 01:11:58.735
What do you want me to teach you?

01:11:59.194 --> 01:12:00.278
I wanna know how to do

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.696
what you did with your parents.

01:12:02.489 --> 01:12:04.491
How to erase yourself from someone's memory.

01:12:04.991 --> 01:12:07.827
Clancy, I told you.
I don't know how I did that.

01:12:07.869 --> 01:12:08.870
I know.

01:12:09.704 --> 01:12:11.498
But if you let me walk through your memories,

01:12:11.539 --> 01:12:13.166
then maybe I can figure it out.

01:12:14.584 --> 01:12:16.419
If we can figure out how you did it,

01:12:16.461 --> 01:12:19.297
then maybe we can figure out how to undo it.

01:12:21.591 --> 01:12:23.468
And you'll let Chubs use your computer?

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:24.427
Yeah.

01:12:26.262 --> 01:12:27.305
Okay.

01:12:29.474 --> 01:12:30.600
Great.

01:12:31.726 --> 01:12:34.187
Okay. Now, close your eyes...

01:12:34.896 --> 01:12:36.189
think about your parents.

01:12:43.154 --> 01:12:45.532
Go back to the night of your 10th birthday.

01:13:13.226 --> 01:13:15.270
<i>Don't worry anymore, Mommy and Daddy.</i>

01:13:15.311 --> 01:13:17.605
<i>Nothing can take me away from you.</i>

01:13:46.509 --> 01:13:48.803
- Stop! What are you doing?
- Shh! Just relax.

01:13:49.679 --> 01:13:51.639
It's okay, Ruby. I won't hurt you.

01:13:56.978 --> 01:13:58.521
Don't worry.

01:13:58.563 --> 01:14:01.566
Now that I know how, I'll just erase
this part and we can start over.

01:14:11.951 --> 01:14:13.078
Ruby, what are you doing here?

01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:15.372
Nothing, I just want to be alone.

01:14:15.413 --> 01:14:16.664
Well, you're crying.

01:14:16.706 --> 01:14:17.999
No, I'm not. Please, just go away.

01:14:18.041 --> 01:14:19.167
What happened?

01:14:19.209 --> 01:14:20.794
I don't want to tell you, Liam.

01:14:20.835 --> 01:14:22.045
Why can't you just leave me alone?

01:14:22.087 --> 01:14:23.963
I don't want you to be alone.
Tell me what's going on.

01:14:24.005 --> 01:14:25.215
- Stop!
- Ruby!

01:14:25.256 --> 01:14:26.925
- Stop!
- Ruby!

01:14:26.966 --> 01:14:28.259
Stop it!

01:14:30.261 --> 01:14:31.805
<i>Stop! What are you doing?</i>

01:14:31.846 --> 01:14:32.847
<i>Shh! Just relax.</i>

01:14:33.973 --> 01:14:36.518
<i>It's okay, Ruby. I won't hurt you.</i>

01:14:38.269 --> 01:14:39.604
I'll kill him.

01:14:40.271 --> 01:14:41.398
Liam, wait.

01:14:44.275 --> 01:14:45.527
Let's just leave.

01:14:53.952 --> 01:14:55.495
- I'll get Zu.
- Okay.

01:14:55.537 --> 01:14:57.163
Chubs, we gotta go.

01:14:57.205 --> 01:14:58.248
Hey, Zu. Wake up.

01:14:58.289 --> 01:14:59.624
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did I miss something?

01:14:59.666 --> 01:15:00.959
The four of us are leaving right now.

01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:02.419
It's about damn time!

01:15:06.131 --> 01:15:07.298
Through here.

01:15:09.551 --> 01:15:11.219
Come on. This way's not guarded.

01:15:24.107 --> 01:15:25.483
Look who's here.

01:15:27.277 --> 01:15:28.611
Our little fugitive.

01:15:31.498 --> 01:15:32.699
Get out of here.

01:15:36.786 --> 01:15:37.787
Liam.

01:15:38.621 --> 01:15:39.789
Liam, come on.

01:15:41.541 --> 01:15:43.460
He can't hear you, Ruby.

01:15:46.254 --> 01:15:47.589
Clancy?

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:48.882
He's with them.

01:15:50.342 --> 01:15:51.468
Oh, shit!

01:15:52.218 --> 01:15:53.219
They're rounding us up.

01:15:54.429 --> 01:15:55.930
Get up, you asshole.

01:15:57.724 --> 01:15:59.351
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

01:15:59.392 --> 01:16:00.518
How's my dad?

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:04.064
Enjoying your old padded cell.

01:16:06.024 --> 01:16:07.275
Anyway, we got kids to round up.

01:16:07.317 --> 01:16:08.943
Lots of new recruits for my army.

01:16:09.819 --> 01:16:11.154
- Call the birds.
- Ruby, we gotta go.

01:16:11.196 --> 01:16:12.614
Already en route, sir.

01:16:16.326 --> 01:16:17.452
I liked you, Ruby.

01:16:18.953 --> 01:16:20.121
I really did.

01:16:20.705 --> 01:16:23.500
So believe me when I say
I am broken up about this.

01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:28.338
I'm just... trying to make
this miserable world

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:30.173
a place where we don't have to be afraid.

01:16:30.715 --> 01:16:32.550
Where those who are special, like you and me,

01:16:32.592 --> 01:16:34.260
can be the ones in charge.

01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:37.722
And you'd rather run around
the woods with this guy?

01:16:39.766 --> 01:16:40.767
Stop!

01:16:42.977 --> 01:16:46.064
No one takes what's mine.

01:16:47.482 --> 01:16:48.483
Stop!

01:16:49.275 --> 01:16:50.527
Not my father.

01:16:50.985 --> 01:16:51.986
Not anyone.

01:16:53.196 --> 01:16:54.656
And certainly not you.

01:16:55.865 --> 01:16:56.866
Stop!

01:16:58.284 --> 01:16:59.953
You know what sucks, Ruby?

01:17:01.413 --> 01:17:03.206
We could've been leading an army together.

01:17:04.207 --> 01:17:06.584
Punishing everyone whoever hurt us.

01:17:07.252 --> 01:17:08.712
Now look where we are.

01:17:11.006 --> 01:17:12.590
My hand hurts, take over.

01:17:12.632 --> 01:17:13.675
Gladly.

01:17:14.467 --> 01:17:15.885
Stop!

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:18.138
Stop!

01:17:18.179 --> 01:17:19.973
Now, I can find it in my heart
to forgive you.

01:17:20.015 --> 01:17:21.683
- Don't!
- It's not up to you.

01:17:22.225 --> 01:17:23.852
You've shown me how to fix you.

01:17:24.394 --> 01:17:25.770
And once I've erased all the parts

01:17:25.812 --> 01:17:27.355
I don't like, you'll do whatever I want.

01:17:27.397 --> 01:17:28.690
Stop! You'll kill him!

01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:30.567
No, I won't.

01:17:32.027 --> 01:17:33.319
I want him alive.

01:17:33.737 --> 01:17:35.655
To see exactly what you become.

01:17:36.781 --> 01:17:38.074
Go to hell!

01:17:46.041 --> 01:17:47.167
Zu, lights!

01:17:58.678 --> 01:18:00.430
Get them, go!

01:18:09.356 --> 01:18:11.191
Open the hatch. Drop the package.

01:18:46.226 --> 01:18:47.227
Reds!

01:18:53.316 --> 01:18:54.317
Run!

01:20:11.019 --> 01:20:12.187
Go, go, go!

01:20:12.228 --> 01:20:13.396
I'm not leaving you.

01:20:13.438 --> 01:20:15.565
You can't fight him! I can.

01:20:17.650 --> 01:20:20.612
I can. Zu, go with Liam.

01:20:20.653 --> 01:20:21.654
Zu, go!

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.531
Liam, they need you.

01:20:24.115 --> 01:20:25.283
Trust me.

01:20:26.117 --> 01:20:28.828
Now, go! Save as many as you can.

01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:30.747
Come on, come on. Let's go! This way.

01:20:31.164 --> 01:20:32.290
Come on. We gotta go!

01:20:32.332 --> 01:20:33.750
Everybody, come on. Let's go!

01:20:33.792 --> 01:20:35.043
- This way!
- Come on! Run!

01:21:33.435 --> 01:21:34.602
It's okay, Ruby.

01:21:35.145 --> 01:21:37.689
Stop fighting. Let me in.

01:21:37.731 --> 01:21:40.984
Let me take all those sad and angry

01:21:41.026 --> 01:21:42.819
thoughts and make them go away.

01:21:42.861 --> 01:21:45.989
I can prune and snip and rewrite you now

01:21:46.031 --> 01:21:47.282
into a better Ruby.

01:21:50.118 --> 01:21:51.411
The perfect Ruby.

01:21:51.911 --> 01:21:54.914
The Ruby I want you to be.

01:22:11.973 --> 01:22:13.975
I kinda like how I am.

01:22:17.645 --> 01:22:19.564
What are you doing? Pull up! Pull up!

01:22:42.003 --> 01:22:45.715
<i>Bird down, bird down. Unknown hostile.</i>

01:22:49.552 --> 01:22:50.762
Ruby!

01:23:41.271 --> 01:23:42.439
Where's Liam and Zu?

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:43.815
I don't know.

01:23:43.857 --> 01:23:45.650
Chubs, we have to get out of here.

01:23:45.692 --> 01:23:47.485
Go, save yourself.

01:23:47.527 --> 01:23:48.820
We have to get you help!

01:23:48.862 --> 01:23:50.321
It's not happening.

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.255
Hey, what are you doing?

01:24:08.006 --> 01:24:09.299
What is that?

01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:11.259
It's help.

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.065
You're gonna be okay.

01:24:38.078 --> 01:24:39.287
Chubs?

01:24:44.584 --> 01:24:46.002
Come on, Chubs.

01:24:48.171 --> 01:24:49.422
Ruby!

01:24:53.301 --> 01:24:54.928
I knew you were okay.

01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:59.557
Liam, you have to get out of here right now.

01:24:59.599 --> 01:25:00.684
Oh, Jesus.

01:25:01.768 --> 01:25:03.269
I'll grab his legs.

01:25:03.311 --> 01:25:05.563
I got Zu to a group of kids.
She's gonna be safe.

01:25:05.605 --> 01:25:06.648
Liam. He needs a hospital.

01:25:06.690 --> 01:25:08.483
Yeah, we'll find one, a vet,
somebody. Come on.

01:25:08.525 --> 01:25:10.318
Liam, we can't fix this.

01:25:23.581 --> 01:25:25.166
I called someone who can.

01:25:32.132 --> 01:25:33.133
The League?

01:25:33.883 --> 01:25:36.261
- No, Ruby.
- "The enemy of my enemy."

01:25:36.302 --> 01:25:37.679
You don't know what they're like.

01:25:37.721 --> 01:25:38.972
You have to get out of here.

01:25:39.264 --> 01:25:41.141
The League is coming,
and they don't trust you.

01:25:41.182 --> 01:25:42.350
They won't take you back.

01:25:51.943 --> 01:25:53.028
I'm staying.

01:25:53.069 --> 01:25:54.404
- Please, Liam, you have to go.
- No.

01:25:57.365 --> 01:25:58.658
We're family, remember?

01:26:01.286 --> 01:26:02.787
I'm not leaving you.

01:27:06.976 --> 01:27:08.353
It's good to see you again.

01:27:10.689 --> 01:27:12.023
Ruby, you're safe here.

01:27:12.065 --> 01:27:13.483
The League owns this house.

01:27:13.733 --> 01:27:16.820
And we use it when things get complicated.

01:27:17.946 --> 01:27:19.739
Chubs is in the hospital.

01:27:20.073 --> 01:27:21.241
He's in pretty bad shape,

01:27:21.282 --> 01:27:23.201
so if he has any chance of making it...

01:27:23.993 --> 01:27:25.120
he'll get it there.

01:27:25.954 --> 01:27:28.289
Don't call him Chubs.
You haven't earned that.

01:27:29.332 --> 01:27:30.500
Charles.

01:27:32.836 --> 01:27:34.963
When he can have visitors, you'll see him.

01:27:37.465 --> 01:27:39.634
You're wondering where Liam is.

01:27:40.135 --> 01:27:41.428
You have to let him go.

01:27:41.469 --> 01:27:42.470
I can't do that.

01:27:42.512 --> 01:27:45.098
Liam's not a killer. You can't make him one.

01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.182
We don't create killers.

01:27:46.224 --> 01:27:49.811
I don't know what Liam told you about the
League, but that is not what we're about.

01:27:49.853 --> 01:27:51.396
Then what is the League about?

01:27:51.855 --> 01:27:53.106
Because as far as I can see,

01:27:53.148 --> 01:27:54.441
you're no better than anyone else.

01:27:54.482 --> 01:27:55.608
We're here to help you...

01:27:56.109 --> 01:27:57.819
and expose the camps for what they are,

01:27:57.861 --> 01:27:59.487
and stop President Gray.

01:27:59.529 --> 01:28:03.074
President Gray and his son
are collecting us, just like you are.

01:28:03.116 --> 01:28:04.826
Okay, Cate. Clearly she
doesn't want to be here.

01:28:04.868 --> 01:28:05.952
Rob, I can handle this.

01:28:05.994 --> 01:28:07.829
So, let's make room for someone useful.

01:28:07.871 --> 01:28:09.205
- Liam is never...
- Look, kid.

01:28:09.622 --> 01:28:12.500
In order to survive we all have
to do things that we don't wanna do.

01:28:12.751 --> 01:28:14.461
Your boyfriend can help us.

01:28:14.502 --> 01:28:16.254
I've seen him fling targets like ragdolls.

01:28:16.296 --> 01:28:17.297
Rob!

01:28:17.339 --> 01:28:18.882
At least with us, he's useful.

01:28:19.716 --> 01:28:21.426
Now, if I have to turn him into a...

01:28:23.803 --> 01:28:26.681
Liam is not a killer.

01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:29.059
Liam is not a killer.

01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:30.769
And you're an asshole.

01:28:30.810 --> 01:28:32.270
I am an asshole.

01:28:32.312 --> 01:28:33.229
Leave.

01:28:41.196 --> 01:28:42.238
Ruby, stop.

01:28:42.947 --> 01:28:44.407
I am your only friend here.

01:28:44.449 --> 01:28:47.535
And you could help us do so much good.

01:28:47.577 --> 01:28:50.038
So, please... stop.

01:28:57.837 --> 01:28:59.214
Let Liam go.

01:28:59.255 --> 01:29:00.382
He is a security risk.

01:29:00.423 --> 01:29:02.342
He knows way too much about us.

01:29:02.384 --> 01:29:03.468
Take me.

01:29:04.094 --> 01:29:05.887
And I'll fight alongside you.

01:29:06.429 --> 01:29:08.181
My one condition...

01:29:08.807 --> 01:29:10.058
is that you let Liam go.

01:29:10.475 --> 01:29:13.561
But if Liam cares for you
as much as you care for him...

01:29:15.522 --> 01:29:16.815
why would he ever leave?

01:29:18.483 --> 01:29:20.193
Let me talk to him.

01:29:59.691 --> 01:30:02.819
Crazy thing is I had...
I had all these plans...

01:30:04.654 --> 01:30:06.614
all these places I would take you.

01:30:08.533 --> 01:30:10.243
- Liam.
- We'll be okay.

01:30:11.036 --> 01:30:12.746
Just can't let them separate us.

01:30:15.999 --> 01:30:18.043
I know it sounds cheesy, but...

01:30:20.879 --> 01:30:23.465
I'd do it all again
if it meant that I met you.

01:30:25.967 --> 01:30:28.094
- You really think that?
- Yeah.

01:30:31.222 --> 01:30:33.850
I mean, the way I see it, you and me...

01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.570
inevitable.

01:30:39.439 --> 01:30:41.191
I'm gonna tell you a story, okay?

01:30:41.441 --> 01:30:42.442
Okay.

01:30:42.776 --> 01:30:44.861
So, it's summer in Salem,

01:30:44.903 --> 01:30:47.280
and you're suffering through
another boring hot July

01:30:47.322 --> 01:30:49.407
working part-time at the ice cream parlor.

01:30:50.283 --> 01:30:51.451
Ice cream.

01:30:51.993 --> 01:30:54.329
But one day, the ice cream parlor

01:30:54.621 --> 01:30:56.039
runs out of ice cream.

01:30:56.956 --> 01:30:59.209
And that happens, you know?

01:30:59.626 --> 01:31:00.877
Your dad says...

01:31:01.419 --> 01:31:03.463
"Hey, let's go to Virginia Beach."

01:31:04.172 --> 01:31:05.632
Where are you in the story?

01:31:05.674 --> 01:31:06.925
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:31:09.052 --> 01:31:12.514
Well, I'm in... I'm in Wilmington.

01:31:13.181 --> 01:31:15.809
Suffering through another boring, hot summer

01:31:15.850 --> 01:31:17.143
working at the garage...

01:31:18.186 --> 01:31:21.022
before heading off to some fancy university.

01:31:21.815 --> 01:31:24.317
My mom can't bear to see her baby leave,

01:31:24.359 --> 01:31:28.446
so she packs us up for
one last week together at...

01:31:29.155 --> 01:31:30.281
Virginia Beach.

01:31:32.659 --> 01:31:35.036
I see where this is going.

01:31:37.414 --> 01:31:40.041
And then, as fate would have it...

01:31:40.834 --> 01:31:42.460
on our last day at the beach...

01:31:44.879 --> 01:31:46.381
I spot you.

01:31:48.008 --> 01:31:49.676
I mean, I'm in the middle
of playing volleyball

01:31:49.718 --> 01:31:51.302
with my best friend, Chubs, but it's...

01:31:52.804 --> 01:31:54.848
It's like everyone else disappears.

01:31:58.309 --> 01:31:59.894
And you're walking towards me...

01:32:01.146 --> 01:32:03.356
you have these big sunglasses on,

01:32:03.773 --> 01:32:06.693
earbuds in and music blaring.

01:32:10.739 --> 01:32:11.990
You're beautiful.

01:32:14.409 --> 01:32:15.869
And you keep smiling and laughing,

01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:17.662
and looking out at the water, but...

01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:24.294
all I want to look at is you.

01:32:36.848 --> 01:32:38.058
What happens next?

01:32:41.603 --> 01:32:42.687
Well...

01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:47.859
I tell you that I love you.

01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:01.831
Close your eyes.

01:33:05.377 --> 01:33:07.003
I'm going to finish this story.

01:34:39.679 --> 01:34:40.555
Who are you?

01:34:41.348 --> 01:34:42.349
The League.

01:34:45.143 --> 01:34:46.936
If you feel well enough, you can go.

01:34:47.228 --> 01:34:49.022
You're the League
and you're just letting me go?

01:34:49.564 --> 01:34:52.275
Supplies, money, new ID.

01:34:52.317 --> 01:34:53.318
Here you go.

01:34:54.402 --> 01:34:55.945
I don't want anything from you.

01:35:07.123 --> 01:35:08.583
You're what, 16?

01:35:10.085 --> 01:35:11.920
You should know better
than to work for the League.

01:35:16.174 --> 01:35:17.217
Go.

01:35:17.634 --> 01:35:19.344
Before we change our minds.

01:35:31.981 --> 01:35:32.982
Liam.

01:35:37.654 --> 01:35:38.780
Just be careful.

01:35:41.616 --> 01:35:42.617
You too.

01:36:03.471 --> 01:36:04.597
We're ready for you.

01:36:11.187 --> 01:36:13.523
<i>"All the world will be your enemy.</i>

01:36:14.983 --> 01:36:17.944
<i>Prince with a thousand enemies."</i>

01:36:19.863 --> 01:36:22.407
<i>But we don't have to stay in darkness.</i>

01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:26.619
<i>You taught me the only ones
who could help us...</i>

01:36:27.412 --> 01:36:28.705
<i>are us.</i>

01:36:29.831 --> 01:36:30.832
<i>So...</i>

01:36:31.916 --> 01:36:33.710
<i>I have to let you go...</i>

01:36:35.378 --> 01:36:36.713
<i>and step into the light.</i>

01:36:40.175 --> 01:36:42.218
<i>To protect our greatest cause.</i>

01:36:44.763 --> 01:36:45.764
<i>Our family.</i>

01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:49.392
<i>For Zu.</i>

01:36:53.938 --> 01:36:55.106
<i>For Chubs.</i>

01:36:59.861 --> 01:37:00.945
<i>For you...</i>

01:37:01.821 --> 01:37:02.822
<i>Liam.</i>

01:37:07.452 --> 01:37:10.955
<i>I will not falter in the face of our enemies.</i>

01:37:13.375 --> 01:37:15.168
<i>No matter how strong.</i>

01:37:18.588 --> 01:37:20.340
<i>I will be brave.</i>

01:37:21.966 --> 01:37:24.260
<i>I will fight to create a better place</i>

01:37:24.302 --> 01:37:25.470
<i>for all of us...</i>

01:37:26.846 --> 01:37:28.306
<i>so that our family...</i>

01:37:30.475 --> 01:37:32.352
<i>will never be destroyed.</i>
