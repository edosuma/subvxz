00:13.388 --> 00:16.182
- Deep in the woods,
there lies a secret door,

00:16.224 --> 00:18.601
and behind it, nightmares.

00:18.643 --> 00:19.853
No!

00:19.894 --> 00:22.605
Real nightmares.

00:22.647 --> 00:25.525
I belong to a colony
that has sworn for centuries

00:25.567 --> 00:28.194
to guard this door
and to protect our world

00:28.236 --> 00:29.904
from the horrors
that lie behind it.

00:31.239 --> 00:34.284
It is my duty,
and I cannot fail.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.208
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.919
I'm sorry!

01:50.819 --> 01:52.195
Shh!

01:53.405 --> 01:54.906
All right, listen close.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.908
Count to 100 after I leave

01:56.950 --> 01:59.285
and then go to the council.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.872
Tell them that Disciples
have been hurt.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.791
Can you do this?

02:15.051 --> 02:16.386
Warmth to you.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.224
- Carrie?

02:21.266 --> 02:22.517
Carrie Ecker?

02:22.559 --> 02:24.019
Hey, there,
why aren't you at your post?

02:33.903 --> 02:35.196
Carrie!

02:36.698 --> 02:38.366
- Carrie!

02:38.408 --> 02:40.452
- Get back here,
Carrie Ecker!

02:40.493 --> 02:42.704
- Hey!

02:53.882 --> 02:56.593
- This way, follow me.

02:56.634 --> 02:57.844
Quickly!

03:06.770 --> 03:08.646
- She's close.

03:08.688 --> 03:09.731
- Let's go.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.158
- This is how we dance...
- In West Pine!

04:44.701 --> 04:47.287
Like this. Like this.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.414
both: This is how
we eat in West Pine.

04:51.624 --> 04:52.625
- Mmm!
- Ah!

04:52.667 --> 04:54.961
You want to get a fresh egg...

04:56.796 --> 04:59.841
And then pour
your artisan toppings.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.137
both: This is how we express
our emotions in West Pine.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.558
- Why isn't anyone
watching these?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.810
We're literal comedic geniuses.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.979
- Because no one knows
what West Pine is.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.773
- It's a town.
They get the concept.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.358
Like,
I need to be famous fast

05:16.399 --> 05:19.319
so I don't have to get a job
selling diapers and Vaseline.

05:19.361 --> 05:20.320
- Eh, make an OnlyFans.

05:20.362 --> 05:21.696
- You make an OnlyFans.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.740
- Also, what do you even
put on your résumé?

05:23.782 --> 05:25.116
You haven't done shit.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.495
- Skilled in math,
spreadsheets, dance.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.705
Okay, dance.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.249
And cashiers
don't make spreadsheets.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.668
- Wha--okay.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.462
Well, a robber comes in
and is like,

05:37.504 --> 05:40.090
"Bitch, organize my data!"

05:40.131 --> 05:41.466
I don't know.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.680
- Unrealistic.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.682
Robbery is far too interesting
for West Pine.

05:48.723 --> 05:49.933
- Bro, you're about
to be on TV.

05:49.974 --> 05:52.018
Stop pretending
that's not interesting.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.812
- Not the kind of interest
that I want.

05:53.853 --> 05:54.938
- Maybe your parents would stop

05:54.979 --> 05:57.399
putting everyone
out of a job, then.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.608
- I will murder you,

05:58.650 --> 06:01.361
like, actually.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.904
- Look, all I'm saying is,

06:02.946 --> 06:04.698
if I'm gonna
stare into the void all day,

06:04.739 --> 06:06.199
I might as well
get paid for it.

06:06.241 --> 06:07.367
- Ooh, ow.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.035
- Make some rent
for when we graduate

06:09.077 --> 06:11.746
and can get
the fuck out of here.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.164
But then I won't

06:13.206 --> 06:14.916
get to stare
into the void with you.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.627
- Wow, you Frisks
really hate jobs.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.881
- For the billionth time,
Nolan.

06:55.623 --> 06:58.209
- Hey, Lumi.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.128
You ready to get on camera?

07:03.673 --> 07:05.759
- There's something out there.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.682
- Come on.
Hold up your sign, baby.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.894
- The dead girl is me.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.313
Okay.

07:18.355 --> 07:22.067
That deserves a chocolate.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.613
- There he is.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.075
- Would you like to take
another four hours?

07:30.116 --> 07:32.202
We can wait.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.454
Why the earring?

07:34.496 --> 07:36.206
- Why the dye job?

07:36.247 --> 07:37.916
- Women suffer enough
for the vanities.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.167
Now the boys want in, too?

07:39.209 --> 07:41.378
- I just wanted to pizzaz you
on your big day.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.962
Get beside your dad.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.840
You're distracting.
Seriously.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.134
- I'm here at the home
of Victoria Frisk--

07:48.176 --> 07:50.261
lawyer behind
the high-profile suit

07:50.303 --> 07:51.930
against West Pine Nickel--

07:51.971 --> 07:55.642
as she celebrates the closure
of one of the mine's tunnels.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.811
- Gallery eight was dumping
acid runoff

07:57.852 --> 07:59.521
right into our drinking water.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.398
I can't say I'll miss that.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.149
But our work isn't over.

08:03.191 --> 08:06.361
So long as WPN operates,
we tempt fate.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.113
We're inviting a blight

08:08.154 --> 08:09.155
onto our town--

08:09.197 --> 08:10.615
one that will
drive our children

08:10.657 --> 08:12.450
to sickness and death.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.828
History is defined
by those who act

08:14.869 --> 08:16.830
in the face
of intense opposition

08:16.871 --> 08:19.207
simply because
they know it's right.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.967
- Calm mind, steady hand.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.636
Calm mind, steady hand.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.820
Excuse me, sir.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.239
Do you know where I might find
a bus to Salem?

08:52.657 --> 08:54.617
- Front of grocery,
on the hour.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.369
- Do you know when might be?

08:59.289 --> 09:01.958
- Your religious group
not teach you to read?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.668
Look at the schedule.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.480
- I'll take this to the back
for Lee to review tomorrow.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.190
- Appreciate you. Thanks.

09:29.361 --> 09:30.945
Hey.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.489
Are you all right?

09:35.450 --> 09:37.160
- Have you seen this girl?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.299
- Hi, sir.
How can I help you?

09:51.341 --> 09:52.342
- Just looking.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.480
- Go, go.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.612
Something for your kids.

10:22.664 --> 10:23.748
- Hi.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.791
Sorry.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.459
Uh, cool if I join?

10:29.295 --> 10:31.548
You're from
the Disciples of Dawn, right?

10:31.589 --> 10:34.050
You, um, running
from the colony?

10:34.092 --> 10:37.220
Like--like, leaving them?

10:37.262 --> 10:40.682
We don't see y'all much.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.435
Here.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.395
- Oh.

10:45.437 --> 10:46.896
- I'm Tasha.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.609
- Thank you for helping me.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.778
- Uh, i-it's yours--

10:53.820 --> 10:56.072
a gift between new friends.

10:56.114 --> 10:59.576
Although friends usually know
one another's names.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.037
- Carrie.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.455
My name is Carrie.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.873
- Cute name.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.332
Carrie...

11:06.374 --> 11:09.377
I think you might need
a disguise.

11:13.882 --> 11:15.717
- Five, four,

11:15.759 --> 11:18.887
three, two, one.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.431
Ready or not, here I come!

11:31.608 --> 11:34.944
Snowball, you freaky bitch.

11:34.986 --> 11:37.489
We both got our cages, huh?

11:41.826 --> 11:43.828
Gonna find you, Lumi!

11:45.955 --> 11:48.208
You can't hide from me,
you little bug.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.252
Here I come!

12:32.293 --> 12:34.587
- Lumi!

12:36.047 --> 12:38.091
I'm gonna find you.

12:49.853 --> 12:50.979
Lumi?

12:53.606 --> 12:55.108
Lumi?

14:17.023 --> 14:18.775
- Hello.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.921
- Gonna get you, Lumi!

14:39.963 --> 14:42.465
Gonna find you.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.171
- Shoes.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.464
Shoes off.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.969
Dad's never seen
a Sharper Image catalog

15:28.011 --> 15:29.179
he didn't love.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.557
Disarmed.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.727
- The living room has taken
a real man cave sort of aura

15:35.769 --> 15:36.853
since Mom died.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.325
Not sure if Disciples, like,
bathe or whatever,

15:50.367 --> 15:52.243
but feel free.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.454
Red's hot, blue's cold.

15:54.496 --> 15:55.955
Are you okay figuring it out?

15:55.997 --> 15:57.791
I know you haven't spent
much time in the real world--

15:57.832 --> 16:00.001
- We're not as blind
as you might think.

16:00.043 --> 16:03.463
- Right, no, I didn't mean,
like, you don't, like--

16:03.505 --> 16:06.508
- You'd be surprised
what the real world looks like.

16:08.093 --> 16:11.262
- Uh, clean towels are here.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.722
Um...

16:14.516 --> 16:15.934
- Just gonna--

16:15.975 --> 16:17.394
Oh, okay.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.114
- "Anti-technological"?

17:56.284 --> 17:57.744
- Thank you for the wash.

17:57.786 --> 17:59.245
- Oh. Okay.

17:59.287 --> 18:02.374
I put some, uh, clothes
over there.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.960
Yeah.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.439
Would your father be able
to take me to Salem tonight?

18:26.481 --> 18:28.441
- Uh, you know people in Salem?

18:28.483 --> 18:30.985
- I-I was told
that I could disappear there.

18:31.027 --> 18:34.322
- Yeah.
We can figure something out.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.408
Are the scars from them?

18:36.449 --> 18:38.034
The Disciples?

18:40.829 --> 18:43.998
We don't hear much
about you guys.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.543
I mean, kids tell stories,
but kids also chug cough syrup.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.962
So...

18:50.005 --> 18:52.298
Just curious why y'all live
out in the woods like that.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.634
- It's to protect you...

18:54.676 --> 18:56.970
so you don't have to know
what we know

18:57.012 --> 18:58.930
about the dangers
that go on out there.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.141
- Like what, Bigfoot?

19:01.182 --> 19:02.851
Sexy werewolves?

19:06.187 --> 19:08.231
- Your eyes are very yellow.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.108
- It's my signature look--

19:10.150 --> 19:11.985
electric.

19:12.027 --> 19:14.154
Do you want to try?

19:14.195 --> 19:16.114
They'd never recognize you.

20:00.241 --> 20:01.368
- Lumi, babe!

20:01.409 --> 20:04.412
- Lumi!
- Lumi!

20:04.454 --> 20:06.206
- Lumi!

20:06.247 --> 20:07.540
- Lumi!
- Lumi!

20:07.582 --> 20:09.042
- Lumi!

20:09.084 --> 20:10.543
- Lumi!

20:10.585 --> 20:12.796
- Go for the tree line!
- Lumi!

20:12.837 --> 20:14.089
Oh, my God.
- Hey.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.091
Do you think it might be
an angry miner?

20:16.132 --> 20:17.592
One of your ex's friends?

20:19.219 --> 20:20.637
- She's not a dog, Gordon!

20:20.679 --> 20:22.180
- Where is she?

20:22.222 --> 20:23.223
- No, no, no.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.432
- Lumi!

20:24.474 --> 20:26.976
Lumi.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.978
Lumi!

20:31.022 --> 20:32.816
- Lumi!

20:37.862 --> 20:40.907
- I'll go down here.
Lumi!

20:40.949 --> 20:42.909
- Lumi!

20:44.536 --> 20:46.663
- Where are you?

20:51.167 --> 20:52.711
- Hello!

21:21.656 --> 21:23.450
- Ah, New Colony, who dis?

21:23.491 --> 21:24.617
You like?

21:26.953 --> 21:27.787
Yes.

21:27.829 --> 21:30.248
Uh, maybe less colors.

21:31.541 --> 21:32.959
Oh.

21:33.001 --> 21:35.628
Is that pickles?
- Sandalwood.

21:35.670 --> 21:38.214
It doesn't hurt to try, right?

21:38.256 --> 21:40.550
Disciples don't use internet,
do you?

21:40.592 --> 21:42.260
- Hmm?

21:43.928 --> 21:46.056
Oh!

21:46.097 --> 21:48.350
You're safe.

21:48.391 --> 21:51.686
Oh, it's okay!
Nolan's a friend.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.480
You will never guess
what's going on.

21:53.521 --> 21:54.981
- Lumi's missing.
- Wait, what?

21:55.023 --> 21:56.483
- I was supposed
to be watching her

21:56.524 --> 21:58.026
I-I'm freaking out.
Is Khalil home?

21:58.068 --> 21:59.944
- No, but he's about
to get off work.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.321
There's something
I have to tell you--

22:01.363 --> 22:02.739
- Everybody blames me,
which may be valid--

22:02.781 --> 22:04.157
I was so stoned, but...

22:04.199 --> 22:05.658
I'm actually scared.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.327
Like, I think something bad
might have really happened.

22:07.369 --> 22:09.162
- Oh, my God.
- Just--

22:09.204 --> 22:12.582
This was on a tree, like,
20 feet from my house.

22:12.624 --> 22:14.167
Evil, right?

22:14.209 --> 22:16.503
A-a-and I heard this, like,
freaky, like, whistling sound.

22:16.544 --> 22:17.671
- What?
- I don't know.

22:17.712 --> 22:20.632
- Are...you...ready?

22:20.674 --> 22:22.676
- For...Fat...Freddy's!

22:22.717 --> 22:24.094
Dad, you get disco fries?

22:24.135 --> 22:25.428
Don't hide in there.

22:25.470 --> 22:26.680
Go under the bed.
No, no, don't.

22:26.721 --> 22:27.597
- Why?
- Go under the bed.

22:27.639 --> 22:30.183
Go under the bed.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.109
What the f--

22:41.820 --> 22:43.446
- Do I look like a joke to you?

22:43.488 --> 22:44.823
- What?

22:44.864 --> 22:46.449
- Hell, yeah,
I got disco fries.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.495
- What was that sound?

22:50.537 --> 22:52.038
- What was what sound?

23:00.672 --> 23:03.091
- Well, hello, there.

23:03.133 --> 23:04.342
You with him?

23:14.853 --> 23:17.731
- Saw you on the telly, Nolan.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.315
Nice of you to pay us a visit.

23:19.357 --> 23:21.693
Take in the sights before your
parents put us all out of work

23:21.735 --> 23:23.737
- I'm not my family, Rhys.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.572
- So you're cool
with WPN, then?

23:25.613 --> 23:28.074
Chill with the mine?

23:28.116 --> 23:29.951
Maybe you should talk
to your parents or something.

23:38.543 --> 23:39.753
- What I can't stand, Tasha,

23:39.794 --> 23:42.422
is when you so audaciously
defy my rules.

23:42.464 --> 23:43.673
- His cousin is missing.

23:43.715 --> 23:45.133
- Probably out
hugging a tree somewhere.

23:45.175 --> 23:46.301
She's a Frisk.

23:46.343 --> 23:48.595
- She's probably
cold and scared, actually.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.930
- Oh, speaking of, Carrie,

23:50.972 --> 23:53.183
my friend's girl volunteers
at a church in Salem,

23:53.224 --> 23:54.517
helps runaways.

23:54.559 --> 23:56.061
I'll take you there
before work tomorrow, okay?

23:56.102 --> 23:57.896
They'll help you make a whole
strategy for reintegrating--

23:57.937 --> 23:59.522
work, all that.

23:59.564 --> 24:00.982
- Her strategy is Salem
tonight.

24:01.024 --> 24:03.109
Let's give her money
and a ride.

24:03.151 --> 24:05.779
- What money, baby?
Medical debt.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.614
- Sell the massage chair.

24:07.655 --> 24:09.657
- I'll sell you first.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.411
- Tomorrow's fine.

24:13.453 --> 24:16.456
I want to help your friend
search for their family tonight

24:16.498 --> 24:18.667
as a thank-you for helping me.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.338
Mmm.

24:25.674 --> 24:28.635
- I respect a woman who eats.

24:28.677 --> 24:30.804
You ready for round two?
- Mm-hmm.

24:37.227 --> 24:40.146
- Tasha, your friend shows
his face on our block again,

24:40.188 --> 24:41.981
I'll rip his
gay little earring off.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.983
- You're tough, Rhys.
How cool.

24:44.025 --> 24:45.819
- Hey, strong features, Tasha.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.779
- Still in high school, Spoons.

24:47.821 --> 24:50.490
- Not bad.

24:50.532 --> 24:53.159
- Tasha, my dear friend,
my muse,

24:53.201 --> 24:54.494
who's she?

24:54.536 --> 24:56.413
- I'm Carrie Ecker.

24:56.454 --> 24:57.747
I'm going to find your cousin.

25:07.465 --> 25:10.135
- Okay, did the pumpkin-humpers
take Lumi? I'm confused.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.761
- Don't call the Disciples
"pumpkin-humpers."

25:11.803 --> 25:12.971
What does that even mean?

25:13.013 --> 25:14.556
- It means one who
humps pumpkins in woods.

25:14.597 --> 25:16.224
Wouldn't want to offend
my cousin's kidnapper.

25:16.266 --> 25:18.601
- It wasn't the colony, but
we've dealt with this, too.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.395
- Oh, good.

25:20.437 --> 25:22.939
- Let's see what turns up.
Who knows?

25:22.981 --> 25:24.899
- I'll split off.
You two go ahead.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.901
We'll cover more ground.

26:08.526 --> 26:11.863
To vast Gehenna
I give my skin,

26:11.905 --> 26:15.658
pray, warm shadow,
let me in.

26:34.094 --> 26:37.097
Calm mind, steady hand.

27:27.731 --> 27:29.024
Come, demon!

27:29.065 --> 27:31.609
Get your blood!

27:35.822 --> 27:36.948
- Um...

27:36.990 --> 27:38.366
- Carrie?

27:41.745 --> 27:43.413
Who are you?
