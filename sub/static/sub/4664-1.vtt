01:40.080 --> 01:44.230
This film is based on an actual event.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.350
On August 15th, 1945, Korea gets liberated,

01:58.440 --> 02:03.630
The South under U.S. influences
and the North under Soviet influences,

02:11.280 --> 02:13.310
June 25th, 1950,
the North Korean People's Army

02:13.400 --> 02:16.590
makes a surprise attack on the South,
The North occupies Seoul in 3 days

02:16.680 --> 02:19.630
and the rest in 40 days, except
for the area south of Nakdong River,

02:27.360 --> 02:35.360
Far outnumbered, many students joined the
South Korean army as volunteer soldiers,

03:06.560 --> 03:08.860
Young-deok, August 8th, 1950

03:55.960 --> 03:57.070
Hey! You!

03:59.120 --> 04:02.550
- Take this to the third platoon!
- Sir?

04:02.640 --> 04:04.230
Gae-sung Store rooftop!

04:04.240 --> 04:07.310
- Get me more ammo!
- Yes, sir!

04:07.400 --> 04:08.380
Captain.

04:08.520 --> 04:11.870
Capt, Kang.
How's the situation there?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.270
Requesting reinforcements, now!

04:15.760 --> 04:18.060
Fire!

05:16.040 --> 05:18.750
Forward!

05:28.920 --> 05:29.900
This is the 3rd platoon!

05:30.000 --> 05:32.910
- How much left?
- That's it, sir.

05:34.760 --> 05:35.980
Captain!

05:36.760 --> 05:39.870
- Where are our reinforcements?
- They have ordered a retreat.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.310
Retreat, now! That's an order!

05:43.400 --> 05:46.350
If you don't, you'll all die!
Listen to me, Capt. Kang!

05:46.440 --> 05:49.070
We can beat them, Commander!

05:57.360 --> 05:58.830
- Lieutenant Kim!
- Yes, sir!

05:58.840 --> 06:00.430
- Backup the 3rd platoon.
- Yes, sir!

06:00.560 --> 06:02.510
- Fight them off no matter what!
- Yes, sir!

06:02.600 --> 06:03.710
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!

06:03.800 --> 06:05.990
- Kim Jun-seop!
- Sir?

06:06.080 --> 06:07.430
Careful out there.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.190
Incoming on the left!

06:25.720 --> 06:28.830
Medics! Over here!

06:28.920 --> 06:32.310
Hurry!

06:57.400 --> 06:59.070
Oh Jang-beom!

07:03.120 --> 07:04.340
Oh Jang-beom!

07:06.880 --> 07:08.670
Back to the 4th defence line!

07:26.600 --> 07:28.350
More ammo, sir!

07:42.040 --> 07:44.070
Take cover!

08:09.920 --> 08:12.150
The machine guns are down!

08:18.000 --> 08:19.110
Take it.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.390
Stay behind me!

08:58.000 --> 09:00.380
Jang-beom! Stay back!

09:05.880 --> 09:08.390
More are coming!

10:23.160 --> 10:25.150
2nd platoon! Sit tight!

10:27.680 --> 10:30.060
Commander!
We've lost contact, sir!

10:32.800 --> 10:35.910
- Try it again!
- Yes, sir!

10:58.560 --> 11:00.630
Capt. Lee Myung-guk, sir!

11:02.720 --> 11:04.710
Still couldn't break through?

11:04.800 --> 11:06.830
The remnants are starting to run away.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.030
We'll seize the place, soon!

11:09.120 --> 11:14.270
Unit 766 will finish fighting
and head to Pohang, now!

11:15.520 --> 11:17.510
Liberate our country!

11:17.600 --> 11:20.790
Unify our country!

11:23.240 --> 11:24.950
Kill every one of them!

11:25.040 --> 11:27.230
Charge!

11:29.800 --> 11:32.390
Commander!
Send us reinforcements, sir!

11:32.520 --> 11:35.950
We'll get all the damn commies!

11:41.920 --> 11:45.510
Retreat! Retreat!

12:25.160 --> 12:26.790
- Let's go!
- Run!

12:30.320 --> 12:33.350
Get them, now!

13:42.160 --> 13:43.670
Take your picture, sir.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.780
Yes, sir.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.710
I understand, sir.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.790
Commander.

13:58.880 --> 14:05.870
Our political leader has ordered us to go
to the battle at Nakdong River at once.

14:05.960 --> 14:10.710
Look, Commissar Lee An-nam.
Why should I go there?

14:10.800 --> 14:16.830
- I'm going straight to Pohang.
- But it's the party's order!

14:16.920 --> 14:22.750
What do those scribbling
at their desks know about war?

14:22.840 --> 14:27.350
Are you saying
you will go against an order?

14:29.120 --> 14:33.190
Comrade, who is above the party?

14:38.760 --> 14:41.140
Who is at the top of the party?

14:43.120 --> 14:46.710
Our Great Supreme Commander.

14:49.840 --> 14:55.630
On the day I left Pyongyang
our Great Supreme Commander

14:55.720 --> 15:02.990
ordered me to seize Busan
before August 15th!

15:06.920 --> 15:08.590
- Lieutenant!
- Yes, sir!

15:08.680 --> 15:12.190
Our 766 unit will march
straight for Pohang.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.670
Stop hesitating! Blow it up, now!

15:30.760 --> 15:34.030
If we cut off the bridge,
the refugees will be stranded!

15:34.120 --> 15:38.270
- What will happen to them, sir?,
- That's an order, Kang Seok-dae!

16:22.400 --> 16:25.190
We'll take care of you.
Don't worry.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.190
Hold on.
The medication's coming,

17:03.880 --> 17:06.510
We'll give you morphine.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.270
Kim Jun-seop

17:14.880 --> 17:16.550
Take away the body.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.550
Can you hear me?

19:10.640 --> 19:11.780
Or can't you?

19:16.720 --> 19:19.990
It looks like your eardrums are ruptured.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.310
Does it hurt?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.710
What's your name?

19:41.560 --> 19:44.870
Do you know when you got hurt?

19:52.120 --> 19:54.350
Don't want to talk to me?

20:14.640 --> 20:17.100
- What happened to Kim Jun-seop?
- Killed in action, sir.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.670
That fool.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.870
Where are our backup troops?

20:27.720 --> 20:30.510
- Why did you stop the artillery support?
- Capt. Kang,

20:32.760 --> 20:35.550
Our 3rd division has done nothing
but retreat for the last 40 days.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.790
We're sick of retreating!

20:37.880 --> 20:40.110
When are the allied forces coming?

20:40.200 --> 20:42.760
Where do we run away to now?

20:44.160 --> 20:46.830
All the way to Busan?
Then what? Jump into the sea?

20:46.920 --> 20:48.630
Enough! Capt. Kang!

20:50.000 --> 20:51.670
Stop.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.030
I know.

21:04.040 --> 21:08.950
Watching your men die,
it breaks your heart.

21:10.920 --> 21:14.110
I didn't have any troops to send you.

21:14.200 --> 21:20.230
And the artillery units had to go
and save the 4th division at Wonpori.

21:22.280 --> 21:26.950
Our 3rd division are going to fight
at Nakdong River immediately.

21:27.040 --> 21:32.060
The North's 5th, 12th, and 15th
divisions are swarming towards Nakdong.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.910
We've been ordered to annihilate them.

21:37.440 --> 21:41.190
Nakdong River will be a pool of blood.

21:41.880 --> 21:47.150
Because we have nowhere else to retreat
to, It's our last line of defence.

21:50.720 --> 21:54.790
Then which unit will protect Pohang?

22:50.600 --> 22:52.310
Attention!

22:52.400 --> 22:54.550
All student soldiers in there!

22:56.400 --> 22:57.990
Hurry up, people!

22:58.880 --> 23:01.990
- Get going!
- Go!

23:02.080 --> 23:03.390
Gather around!

23:03.520 --> 23:05.790
When Kim Jun-seop died,

23:05.880 --> 23:08.950
- were you the one with him?
- Yes, sir.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.630
Hurry up!

23:21.080 --> 23:25.270
- What's your name, son?
- Oh Jang-beom, sir.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.870
Catch!

24:00.960 --> 24:02.510
Good day, sir.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.160
- What is it?
- Just wondering...

24:05.240 --> 24:06.710
Those boys over there

24:06.800 --> 24:10.110
are bound for juvenile reformatory
on murder charges,

24:10.200 --> 24:12.790
But they want to become
student soldiers instead,

24:12.880 --> 24:16.660
and fight against the damn commies,

24:16.760 --> 24:19.190
Will you take fools like them?

24:19.280 --> 24:24.830
I'm sure they'll be good
at fighting and stuff.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.190
Especially this one, here.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.430
He looks a little old.

24:36.560 --> 24:40.150
- Sure he's a student?
- You're a student, right?,

24:40.240 --> 24:44.990
The other students are gathered
over there. Run over!

24:51.720 --> 24:53.830
Don't worry, sir.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.710
Run you fools!

24:58.240 --> 25:01.350
His parents got shot dead by commies.

25:01.440 --> 25:05.830
He's itching to get
his hands on the commies.

25:07.360 --> 25:09.590
Sign here, please.

25:18.200 --> 25:22.070
68 new, plus 3 existing student soldiers,
all 71 here, sir!

25:23.240 --> 25:24.830
The existing 3 step forward.

25:38.080 --> 25:45.030
Give the new student soldiers
a rifle and 250 bullets each.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.310
Now, sir?

25:51.400 --> 25:54.940
Come up, one at a time!

25:55.040 --> 25:56.020
Next!

25:56.120 --> 25:58.870
Back to positions
after getting your weapons!

25:58.960 --> 26:00.550
Move it!

26:04.240 --> 26:06.910
Whoa!

26:11.600 --> 26:13.270
Awesome!

26:17.200 --> 26:19.270
Men!

26:19.360 --> 26:21.820
You will now be formed into one unit.

26:22.720 --> 26:26.230
You will be divided into two platoons.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.190
Your captain will be...

26:30.720 --> 26:32.910
Oh Jang-beom here.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.220
Excuse me, sir?

26:34.240 --> 26:38.910
- What is it?
- Why's he the captain, sir?

26:39.000 --> 26:40.550
Any objections?

26:40.640 --> 26:42.510
Can't we vote to choose the leader?

26:42.600 --> 26:46.510
Yeah! Let's do it democratically!

26:46.600 --> 26:51.620
How about who eats the most?
I'm pretty good at that, myself!

26:51.720 --> 26:53.870
Quiet! You think this is a picnic!

26:53.960 --> 26:57.190
The captain must have combat experience.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.510
Oh Jang-beom's your captain.

26:59.600 --> 27:05.390
From now on, you will defend this place.

27:05.520 --> 27:09.990
Our 3rd division command
will all go to fight at Nakdong River.

27:14.040 --> 27:17.030
You mean

27:17.120 --> 27:20.820
we have to protect this place?

27:20.920 --> 27:23.350
- Just us, sir?
- That's right.

27:23.440 --> 27:28.110
- Does Pohang need to be protected?
- Pohang is a strategic point.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.580
Then why are the soldiers leaving?

27:30.680 --> 27:35.990
Pohang is important,
but if we loose the battlefront at Nakdong,

27:36.080 --> 27:38.510
we're all dead.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.830
Information tells us now,

27:40.920 --> 27:45.550
it's safer here compared to Nakdong River.

27:45.640 --> 27:47.750
How long do we have to stand guard?

27:47.840 --> 27:49.843
The allied forces will
arrive in Busan soon.

27:49.856 --> 27:51.870
Just till then.

27:51.960 --> 27:55.950
Don't go, sir. Can't you stay?

27:57.120 --> 27:59.710
It's an order from above.

27:59.800 --> 28:05.830
- A soldier moves according to orders.
- Sir?

28:05.920 --> 28:10.550
What if the commies attack?
What then?

28:10.640 --> 28:12.830
Then we kill them all!

28:12.920 --> 28:16.310
Fool. We don't know how to shoot!

28:16.400 --> 28:20.100
Shit. Then we learn.

28:20.200 --> 28:24.510
Can't run away, right?
We fight them, right?

28:26.600 --> 28:29.430
Student soldiers,

28:29.560 --> 28:34.580
are you soldiers or not?

28:34.680 --> 28:37.950
This is your country.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.110
I trust you will defend it.

28:47.240 --> 28:48.300
Here.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.510
Remember,

28:52.600 --> 28:55.060
put it up higher than the arm.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.550
Don't forget.

29:26.680 --> 29:31.310
First you press power
then set the frequency.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.940
Then you turn the volume up to hear.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.270
- What's this again?
- The frequency, sir.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.030
No, it's the power button!

29:41.800 --> 29:45.070
We have no time.
You bury those killed in action.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.430
- Captain
- What?

30:01.200 --> 30:04.870
You can do it.
If anything happens, call me.

30:07.520 --> 30:10.310
I can't be the captain here.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.910
I was never the leader type.

30:16.760 --> 30:17.950
Lead them with heart.

30:19.160 --> 30:23.750
If your sincerity gets through,
they will all follow you.

30:54.200 --> 30:59.030
It'll take our engineer units two days
to come to build a temporary bridge.

30:59.120 --> 31:03.110
Then 18 hours to build it.
So three days in total.

31:03.200 --> 31:08.590
We don't have enough rubber boats
to make a pontoon bridge, either.

31:13.040 --> 31:17.150
Going around that mountain
will take a day and a half.

31:17.240 --> 31:19.750
But the enemy could be waiting in ambush.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.790
Commander,

31:24.880 --> 31:31.590
why don't we go to Nakdong
as the party ordered?

31:33.320 --> 31:38.180
This is why theorists like you
are no use on the battlefield.

31:38.280 --> 31:40.510
Think about it.

31:40.600 --> 31:48.600
When they're feeling safe,
we should strike them from behind.

31:48.800 --> 31:52.110
Then any ideas on how to cross the river?

31:54.640 --> 31:59.350
The shock troops will swim across
the river minimally armed.

31:59.440 --> 32:00.790
Yes, sir.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.550
We'll swim across!

32:02.640 --> 32:05.590
The tank unit goes around the mountain.

32:07.320 --> 32:09.150
Swim across, now!

32:11.680 --> 32:13.910
766 shock troops!

32:14.000 --> 32:17.310
- Swim!
- Yes, sir!

32:30.440 --> 32:34.310
South Korean comrades.

32:34.400 --> 32:38.390
I can't wait to see your damn faces.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.270
There's chocolate!

32:52.360 --> 32:55.230
Move!

32:55.320 --> 32:56.230
Get your hands off!

32:58.560 --> 33:01.230
Scram!

33:02.680 --> 33:05.110
Just one chocolate bar. Please?,

33:10.720 --> 33:12.150
Hey.

33:12.160 --> 33:17.020
Student soldiers!
Student soldiers!

33:17.120 --> 33:24.190
You will be divided into
2 platoons and work on...

33:24.280 --> 33:26.550
What's he yapping about?

33:30.040 --> 33:33.870
Speak louder. I can't hear you.

33:35.200 --> 33:41.110
The 1st platoon will
bury the dead soldiers.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.950
Did you eat?

33:44.040 --> 33:47.230
If you didn't, go stuff yourself.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.310
You three weak musketeers.

33:54.560 --> 33:57.830
You boys.

33:57.920 --> 34:01.150
Have you ever stabbed someone?

34:01.240 --> 34:03.990
Ever killed a damn commie?

34:06.680 --> 34:11.030
I ain't burying corpses.

34:12.960 --> 34:16.630
Why should we do it?

34:16.719 --> 34:20.420
We came to kill commies not bury corpses!

34:20.560 --> 34:21.699
Right?

34:21.800 --> 34:23.230
- Right!
- Yeah!

34:23.320 --> 34:24.630
Yeah, he's right.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.909
But still, listen to the leader.

34:34.800 --> 34:38.030
They're Capt. Kang's orders.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.870
Orders?

34:40.960 --> 34:45.030
What if we go against them?

34:47.080 --> 34:48.989
You'll get shot dead.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.710
By who?

34:55.920 --> 34:57.590
You?

34:59.240 --> 35:01.150
Shoot me?

35:19.200 --> 35:22.190
What are you looking at?, Move.

35:34.640 --> 35:36.910
Take him, Hurry!

35:46.760 --> 35:49.430
One, two, three!

36:06.440 --> 36:08.230
Shoot one bullet...

36:08.320 --> 36:10.780
- Good luck.
- ..Lt's like your 100th shot.

36:10.880 --> 36:17.430
I had eight practice shots before going
to battle, but you get just one.

36:17.560 --> 36:23.710
- So what do we do?
- Shoot one like it's a hundred.

36:23.800 --> 36:28.430
- Again!
- Shoot one like it's a hundred!

36:28.560 --> 36:30.510
Line up! Firing squad up front!

36:31.680 --> 36:33.190
You son of a bitch!

36:33.280 --> 36:36.430
Watch carefully.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.750
See that?

36:40.840 --> 36:43.990
If you mess up, you'll lose your thumb.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.550
Get down and shoot!

36:50.120 --> 36:51.590
Breech blocks pulled back!

36:51.680 --> 36:53.350
Take aim! Fire!

37:10.560 --> 37:13.020
Why's he shooting so much?

37:14.280 --> 37:16.310
We're supposed to shoot once,

37:27.000 --> 37:30.510
Did you see that?

37:48.360 --> 37:49.950
Hey, Gap-jo.

37:50.040 --> 37:53.710
This won't last two weeks
with all the mouths here.

37:55.760 --> 37:58.060
If he doesn't eat, it can last a month.

37:58.160 --> 38:02.150
This stuff's just snack food for me.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.750
- Hey, Gap-jo.
- What?

38:07.840 --> 38:11.950
Want to call out the three
weak musketeers and scare them?

38:12.040 --> 38:14.190
Show them who we are?

38:15.880 --> 38:17.070
Who are we?

38:17.160 --> 38:20.230
We're orphans! You bastards!

38:20.320 --> 38:22.390
We're gangsters! You bastards!

38:22.520 --> 38:25.190
Gap-jo can't even read! You bastards.

38:25.280 --> 38:27.110
Shut up, bastard.

38:28.800 --> 38:32.310
But that hat looks good on you, Gap-jo.

38:33.440 --> 38:35.710
Damn right,

38:47.680 --> 38:50.310
Whoa! Cool!

38:51.040 --> 38:53.500
Gap-jo, is this a grenade?

38:53.600 --> 38:54.870
Give me that.

38:54.960 --> 38:57.790
- A grenade?
- That's right, fool.

38:57.880 --> 39:02.310
If this blows,
it can wipe out the black market.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.310
- The whole thing will blow up?
- Sure.

39:05.600 --> 39:09.670
We can wipe out
the damn Lily gang with this.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.790
They'll vanish without a trace.

39:17.040 --> 39:19.670
- Stay back!
- Hey!

39:19.760 --> 39:21.910
- Stay back!
- Stop it!

39:22.000 --> 39:24.950
- Don't move!
- Stop it, fool!

39:25.040 --> 39:28.580
- Stay back!
- Son of a bitch!

39:31.280 --> 39:32.710
What's this?

39:34.920 --> 39:38.620
- Are you stupid? It'll blow, fool!
- Throw it, fool!

39:39.920 --> 39:41.310
Throw it!

39:48.840 --> 39:50.750
Jump!

40:05.880 --> 40:08.870
Arms up straight, fool!

40:10.160 --> 40:11.710
What do we do?

40:11.800 --> 40:14.910
There are only three sacks
of potatoes and two sacks of corn left.

40:15.400 --> 40:16.710
Don't worry.

40:16.800 --> 40:19.790
We'll go find food!

40:19.880 --> 40:23.110
Wang-pyo, get up!
Poong-chun, let's go!

40:23.200 --> 40:24.420
Stop right there!

40:27.000 --> 40:28.270
You're not doing it.

40:30.680 --> 40:33.310
- Why?
- It's an order.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.550
An order?

40:35.640 --> 40:40.150
Enough with the damn orders!

41:14.640 --> 41:18.670
How are we going to fight
against the North with them?

41:18.760 --> 41:23.510
But they're trusting us to lead them.

41:23.600 --> 41:28.670
So we have to keep calm
and handle things well.

42:58.760 --> 43:00.710
Mother,

43:00.720 --> 43:02.030
I miss you so much,

43:06.240 --> 43:10.790
The soldiers guarding Pohang

43:10.880 --> 43:14.230
left for Nakdong River today.

43:16.040 --> 43:19.790
There are only 71 of us left here.

43:23.960 --> 43:25.950
Mother,

43:26.040 --> 43:30.750
I can hear fellow students
laughing in the next room.

43:30.840 --> 43:34.590
I don't remember the last time
I heard laughter around here,

43:40.840 --> 43:46.870
I hope their laughter will not vanish away,

43:48.040 --> 43:49.070
Hey!

43:51.240 --> 43:54.350
Can't you dance better than that?

43:54.440 --> 43:57.980
Poong-chun! Let's show them!

44:04.280 --> 44:06.710
In front of damn kiddies.

44:09.440 --> 44:12.110
Charleston swing!

44:28.560 --> 44:29.590
Bastards.

44:35.400 --> 44:38.270
Gap-jo! Hey, Gap-jo!

44:51.320 --> 44:54.110
It's 10 o'clock. Go to bed.

44:55.880 --> 44:57.270
It was just getting fun,

45:03.560 --> 45:04.700
1st platoon! Let's go!

45:04.800 --> 45:08.420
This ain't a picnic! We're at war!

45:08.560 --> 45:09.780
Get up, now!

45:09.880 --> 45:12.510
Let's go,

45:14.680 --> 45:16.750
- See you.
- Sleep tight.

45:32.600 --> 45:34.110
Ain't that heavy?

45:34.200 --> 45:38.990
No, not at all. But why's it so long?

45:39.080 --> 45:42.150
It's American.
They made it for their size.

45:42.240 --> 45:46.190
But it'll shoot really far.

45:48.800 --> 45:49.830
Should I try it?

45:52.960 --> 45:57.390
Go ahead!
Then all the others will come out!

45:59.880 --> 46:02.710
- Hey, bro!
- What?

46:02.800 --> 46:05.150
I miss the Kimchi soup mum used to make.

46:05.240 --> 46:11.550
Her homemade Kimchi
with anchovy broth. So delicious.

46:11.640 --> 46:16.310
See, I told you not to follow me out here.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.910
Are they our troops or the enemy?

47:02.000 --> 47:06.390
If they're the enemy,
nobody shoots till I say so!

47:06.520 --> 47:08.790
We shoot if you shoot?

47:08.880 --> 47:12.550
- Yeah, tell everyone that.
- Got it.

47:14.600 --> 47:17.630
Hey, bro! I've got to pee.

47:19.840 --> 47:23.620
Hold it in.
Did you undo the stabilizer?

47:31.560 --> 47:32.590
Get down!

47:34.080 --> 47:35.990
Get down, now!

47:36.080 --> 47:37.870
Nice cool breeze.

47:40.600 --> 47:43.510
- Not a damn mouse in sight.
- Yeah.

47:43.600 --> 47:45.980
Don't move, fool!

47:46.080 --> 47:49.510
- Where are the enemy soldiers?,
- Damn monsters,

47:49.600 --> 47:53.750
What if we win
without even getting to shoot?,

47:55.160 --> 47:59.030
At this rate, our guns will rust!

48:02.080 --> 48:07.830
This place reminds me of home,

48:43.560 --> 48:44.590
Cease fire!

48:47.360 --> 48:48.390
Cease fire!

49:01.520 --> 49:04.350
Shouldn't we go and check?

49:04.440 --> 49:07.190
Stop trembling, man!

49:07.280 --> 49:08.550
We're supposed to check.

49:14.520 --> 49:15.550
Get up!

50:00.160 --> 50:02.350
Mum...

50:04.160 --> 50:05.550
Mum...

50:08.800 --> 50:10.870
Mum...

50:14.240 --> 50:15.870
Hurry up and kill him!

50:21.040 --> 50:23.420
What? You want me to do it?

50:45.320 --> 50:51.150
Mother, I killed
a North Korean soldier today,

50:53.440 --> 51:00.670
I thought the enemy soldiers
were monsters with horns,

51:00.760 --> 51:08.030
But they cried out for
their mothers just like us,

51:15.560 --> 51:21.550
Mother, why must we be at war?,

51:21.640 --> 51:29.640
I have to get all these mixed emotions
off my chest, Mother.

52:03.840 --> 52:05.230
Over here!

52:05.320 --> 52:06.510
- Have some corn.
- Give it here.

52:06.600 --> 52:08.790
Corns? Come quick!

52:08.880 --> 52:12.500
- Give me one.
- You only get half a corn.

52:12.600 --> 52:16.750
- Scram!
- Ain't there bigger ones?,

52:16.840 --> 52:19.030
We should go out there.
Get ready.

52:20.280 --> 52:22.550
But the commies are lurking out there.

52:22.640 --> 52:24.630
What about the school?

52:27.240 --> 52:29.700
Leave some behind to guard it.

52:59.320 --> 53:03.150
Captain, can we use this?,

53:04.160 --> 53:05.750
Not sure.

53:08.920 --> 53:10.270
Let's take it and see.

53:15.960 --> 53:18.710
Look at that damn stomach!

53:18.800 --> 53:21.830
- Damn lard!
- Hey.

53:33.840 --> 53:35.630
Put that out.

53:39.200 --> 53:42.590
Even my dad
can't tell me what to do.

53:43.560 --> 53:47.180
Stop yapping.
I'm second in command here!

53:49.760 --> 53:52.510
- Do you want to die?
- Why you!

54:02.200 --> 54:06.270
Son of a bitch! That's American!

54:06.360 --> 54:10.430
In the forest a cigarette
can be smelt as far as 4 km away.

54:10.560 --> 54:12.190
What a wimp.

54:14.920 --> 54:16.750
Get down!

54:21.680 --> 54:24.060
Wang-pyo!

54:24.160 --> 54:26.310
Dar-young! Where are you going?

54:26.400 --> 54:27.870
Yong-man!

54:27.960 --> 54:28.940
Get down!

54:29.040 --> 54:30.260
Wang-pyo! Get down!

54:37.440 --> 54:38.500
Wang-pyo!

54:39.600 --> 54:41.310
Wang-pyo! Wang-pyo!

54:42.800 --> 54:44.270
Wang-pyo! Wang-pyo!

54:44.360 --> 54:46.550
What's with Wang-pyo?

54:46.640 --> 54:47.670
Wang-pyo! No!

54:49.440 --> 54:52.150
Damn commies!

54:52.160 --> 54:55.270
I'll kill them all!

54:55.880 --> 54:57.100
Gap-jo!

54:57.200 --> 54:58.670
Gap-jo! Watch out!

55:00.280 --> 55:01.990
Follow them!

55:02.015 --> 55:04.015
SharePirate.Com - Convenient Downloads for Members

56:08.200 --> 56:09.390
Fire!

56:10.280 --> 56:11.710
Get down!

57:17.280 --> 57:19.030
Poong-chon! That way!

58:56.640 --> 58:58.670
Wait here!

58:58.760 --> 59:01.790
Get up! Hurry!

59:34.800 --> 59:37.070
Put the gun down! Now!

59:38.320 --> 59:40.590
Hell no!

59:40.680 --> 59:44.830
I'm a soldier of North Korea
Led by General KIM ll-sung!

59:45.600 --> 59:47.310
Don't shoot! That's an order!

59:47.400 --> 59:50.550
I'll die if I have to!
But I will never surrender!

59:50.640 --> 59:51.670
Don't shoot!

59:51.760 --> 59:56.030
To liberate South Korea
from under the Americans!

59:56.120 --> 01:00:00.030
We'll stand victorious!

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.260
Don't shoot!

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.990
Shoot!

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.310
Go ahead, fool!

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.070
He was a commie!

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.790
He had a gun!

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.270
If a damn commie's got a gun, we kill him!

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.630
Did you see Dar-young?

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.990
Did you see Dar-young?

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.990
- How many died, Jae-sun?
- 16 dead and 5 injured.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.390
- Hold on,
- Take in the pain.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.790
Leave it, bro! Don't touch it!

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.830
It hurts!

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.670
- Don't touch it.
- Hold on tight.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:05.190
- Take in the pain like a man!
- Just leave it!

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.070
Hold still, kid!

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:33.550
I knew Wang-pyo would get killed.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:39.870
Always going around getting hurt and stuff.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.420
Damn fool.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.510
Got a smoke?

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:06.350
I took it from Wang-pyo this morning.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.670
Do you want to have it?

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.630
Forget it.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.860
This is Cuckoo! Come in Nest!

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.310
Come in Nest! Come in!

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.790
Come in Nest! Come in!

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.150
37583758!
This is 3758! Come in!

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:53.790
Capt. Kang Seok-dae, please.
We have something to report.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.310
Capt. Kang. Hello, sir.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:59.750
- This is Choi Jae-sun, sir.
- Who?

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.950
A lot happened yesterday and today, sir.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.350
We killed 12 commies and lost 16 men.

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:12.110
Some got injured, some ran away,
and some didn't make it back!

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:17.590
- We fought the commies twice!
- What? Put your captain on!

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.510
Oh Jang-beom, sir.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.830
They're just the scouting soldiers!

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.830
No telling when the enemy will attack!

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.350
Report to me every 30 minutes!

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:41.380
I'll ask for reinforcements!
Don't be scared and wait!

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.430
We're only 2 hours away!

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:48.750
Hold out for 2 hours! Just 2 hours!

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.630
So? Are they coming?

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:31.580
He'll ask for backup troops,
but there's a big battle there, too.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.710
I could hear bombs every where.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.910
- What if we lose the war?
- What if we lose our country?

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.870
Shut up! Get out!

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.630
Fire!

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.750
Reload!

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:08.350
Preston, Preston! Braston, Braston! Smith!
Get over here, get over here!

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.990
Go! Go! Man down.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:43.910
The North's 5th division
is charging towards Pohang, sir!

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.380
If we don't do something,
the student soldiers will die!

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.270
Pohang's in danger!
They need backup, sir!

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:53.630
Send what troops? Can't you see?

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.750
Nakdong River is a pool of blood!

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.750
The student soldiers are in danger?
Everyone's life is precious!

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:03.910
We have to fight here till the end!
If they break through here, it's all over!

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.190
Then everyone will have to
jump into the sea like you said!

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.110
Is that what you want?

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:20.830
Sacrifice the lesser for the greater cause.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.670
How many military doctors?

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.069
I... I only saw nurses, sir.

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:41.189
How many trucks went out two days ago?

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.670
Fifteen, sir.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.630
Bastard! You said twenty before!

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.109
But I didn't count, sir.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.310
Continue, comrade.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.750
Are you done?

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:56.350
- Soldier.
- Yes, sir.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.820
- Get some water.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.790
For the student comrade.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.670
Give it to him.

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.550
Such intensity in trying
to find out enemy secrets.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:43.710
What a loyal, devoted comrade.
Such passion!

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.990
I'm deeply moved.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:52.430
What do you mean?

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.030
Follow me.

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.190
Get up.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.510
Comrade Lee An-nam.

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.790
Watch and learn.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.510
It's a commie!

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.110
- Dar-young!
- Dar-young!

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:43.990
Who is the leader here?

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.630
Are you comrade Oh Jang-beom?

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.230
And who are you?

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.870
I am

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:26.230
Commander Park Moo-rang,

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.990
of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:34.660
Our troops...

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:43.710
plan on taking over this place
two hours from now at 12:00 pm

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.670
But!

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:56.510
If you hang a white flag up there
and surrender, I'll let you live.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:05.700
I'm showing mercy to you students

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:13.750
because I know you were sent here
as mere human shields.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.980
Also...

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:33.230
Because you comrades

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:37.630
will be the pillars in
our unified Korea's future.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.670
At 12:00...

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.910
We'll see you here.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.110
Comrade,

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.990
I hope nothing unfortunate happens.

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.270
- Lieutenant Kim.
- Yes, sir

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.630
Any changes in the enemy's 5th division?

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:04.150
They're all coming to Nakdong.
No movement in Pohang, sir.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.670
Hear that Kang?

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:10.630
Still say Pohang's in danger?

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.990
But there have been two
confrontations, sir.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:19.030
Just give me 10 men, then.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.550
I'll fight them off, sir.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.230
Follow me!

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.590
Attention!

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.990
- Lee, get your ass over here.
- Yes, sir.

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.390
Ask him if he has any soldiers to spare.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.080
General, do we have any back up
we can send, sir?

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.510
There is a severe shortage of U.S. troops

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.910
even at the Nak Dong river front
as I speak.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.230
I'm afraid it's not possible to send
any new troops any time soon.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.910
The U.S. doesn't have any troops to spare.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.710
Follow me.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.790
Open them up, now.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:38.190
This is the new line of Super Bazookas.
It will make it that much easier

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.500
in stopping those North Korean tanks.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:45.110
He says these new bazookas
will demolish the enemy tanks.

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.110
Thank you! Thank you very much!

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:06.110
I'm going to the battle at Nakdong!

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:09.900
I'll fight like hell till I die!

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:23.350
Dar-young, this bastard!
He's a coward!

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:26.110
He's a traitor!
A scared chicken!

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:31.270
He sold us all out to save his own life!

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:38.310
This son of a bitch
should die by our hands!

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.710
Am I wrong?

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.550
- Hell, no!
- Yeah!

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.020
- Yeah!
- Damn commie informer!

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.750
I think I pooped in my pants.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:55.990
Can't I just die?

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.110
Hold on, little bro.

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:01.150
Capt. Kang will come to save us.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.940
You do it, bro.

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:28.430
I hope you get to eat Mum's Kimchi soup.

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.030
Dar-young!

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.260
Damn traitor!

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:39.030
- Stop it! That's enough!
- Get lost!

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:41.310
- What the...
- Stop it!

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.790
You want to fight, huh!

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.550
Put the gun down, first!

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.830
You can clap and live.

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:26.590
You can go to the North Koreans
and live like a rat!

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.230
Son of a bitch!

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.390
If you're going to run, go quietly!

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:51.350
Me? Run away?

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:08.590
- Gap-jo! Gap-jo!
- Let go!

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:13.140
Coward! Are you that scared of death!

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:19.110
You die like dogs!
I'll fight like hell till I die! Let go!

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.270
Let's go!

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.590
Aren't you coming?

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:28.230
Do whatever you want, fools!

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:33.310
Fight with your bare hands
and die like fools!

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.630
Let's go!

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:04.510
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir.

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:11.670
Commander!

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:16.230
We got word
that the white flag still isn't up.

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.230
Comrade, why are you hesitating?

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.750
Let's attack!

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:32.070
If you went against orders
to attack here, then do it!

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.430
What's holding you back?

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:38.670
How can we end the war
before August 15th like this?

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:41.750
If they were soldiers,
they'd already be dead.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:46.700
- Do you see them as soldiers?
- No matter how young they are.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:51.110
If they have guns, they're the enemy.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:56.750
Comrade, you've become
loose and sluggish.

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.630
Do you hear me?

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:07.030
Bears get killed for their gall bladders.

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.150
People get killed
because of their tongues.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.270
What?

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.110
Comrade Park Moo-rang.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.510
Releasing an enemy soldier
without the party's command

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.710
could get you executed!

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.630
Yap one more word!

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.110
I'll send you back as a corpse!

01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:05.070
Mother,

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:09.910
while changing into
the long johns you packed for me,

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.150
I suddenly thought of the shroud
for the dead,

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:17.870
Mother,

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:22.030
I could very well die today,

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:30.510
I don't think the countless enemies
will go and leave us be,

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.750
Found it!

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:17.550
Set up a line of defence
1 km from the school.

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:20.870
Then wait for my command.

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:23.750
Don't fire.

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:35.630
Let's go.

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:47.590
It's heavy, man. Take it.

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:15.510
LET'S GO

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:21.710
INTO THE FIRE

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:52.390
If we die while fighting,
at least we won't be hungry any more.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:24.430
Capt. Kang is on his way.

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:28.310
We just have to hold out for an hour.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.990
Let's band together and fight!

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.790
- Fight!
- Fight!

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:37.310
- Fight!
- Fight!

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:41.340
Capt. Kang asked us before.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.590
Are student soldiers, soldiers or not!

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:48.750
- Student soldiers.
- Are soldiers!

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:56.840
- Student soldiers!
- Are soldiers!

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:18.630
Free the nation!
Hurray for the North!

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:22.110
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:26.030
Can we help, sir?

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:31.030
Drive!

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:44.550
RIFLES AMMUNITION

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.190
Push!

01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:01.710
It's out!

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:08.430
Good job, comrades.

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:11.310
But where are you comrades headed?

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.350
It's done, Captain.

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:37.910
Fire.

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.270
- What's wrong?
- I did it like they said.

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.630
Call and ask!

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.430
This is Cuckoo! Come in Nest!

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:00.030
Nest! Come in!

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:03.430
We did what you said,
but the bomb didn't fly out.

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:05.350
Sir?

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.070
Chang-woo! Second chief!

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:11.910
- They said, kick it.
- Kick it, then!

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:28.950
- Hey!
- Move!

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:31.950
Move!

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:42.150
- Stop!
- Stop!

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:46.390
What was that?

01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.870
What are you aiming at?
Are you trying to kill us?

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:02.550
- Do it right!
- Don't worry. I'm a math whiz.

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:16.590
Watch out!

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:18.750
Move!

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.350
Commander!

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:26.300
Commander!

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:29.590
Medics!

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:37.150
Fire!

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:41.710
They return mercy with bombs!

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:43.150
Damn bastards.

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:49.230
Fire!

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.590
Kill every one of them!

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:05.590
Rip off every one of their heads!

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:10.310
You said they were just students!
Not soldiers!

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:14.430
- Then how can the students fire mortars!
- Get down!

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:23.380
2nd platoon!
Into the classrooms, now!

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:42.350
- The proud vanguard of this war!
- Yes, sir!

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:47.670
Let's report our victory
to General Kim ll-sung!

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.230
Charge!

01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:47.550
Fire!

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:08.630
2nd platoon!

01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:23.950
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:31.390
Won-hyuk!

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.750
Cuckoo! Come in! Cuckoo!

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.310
Cuckoo! Come in! Cuckoo!

01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:38.510
Cuckoo!

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.590
Die you bastards!

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:44.390
Get down! Everyone inside!

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:47.030
Get back!

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:48.310
Go in, now!

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:50.190
Throw it!

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:20.620
Get back!

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:23.710
Get back, everyone!

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:54.100
Oh Jang-beom! It's not over yet!

01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:56.910
You and me have got to finish our fight!

01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.990
Gap-jo!

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:17.830
Take this!

01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:21.150
- Take in the weapons!
- Follow me! Hurry!

01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:23.950
Hurry up!

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.500
The tanks! Hurry!

01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:38.150
- The tanks are here!
- The tanks are here!

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:47.430
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:51.950
Hurry up!

01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.310
Hurry!

01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:00.310
Get down!

01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:03.630
This way!

01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.070
Go home.

01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:12.830
I have no one to go home to,

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.270
They're all dead,

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:23.140
If I had gone to school,
I bet I would've done better than you.

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:26.070
You're not a student?

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:32.710
We were so damn poor,
I never got to even go near a school.

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:39.070
But now...

01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:41.110
Look at me.

01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:44.390
I'm a student soldier.

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:51.350
You look good.

01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:53.030
Of course you are a student.

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:06.270
- Let's go!
- Let's get them!

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:19.510
Come on!

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:23.230
Look out!

01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:38.830
You... fight way better than me.

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:42.630
You're brave!

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:46.550
Go! Hurry!

01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.710
Go!

01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:53.420
Shit! Let's get them!

01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:20.430
I put the weapons on the rooftop!

01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:22.670
- I'll be right up!
- See you there!

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.190
Hurry! Up!

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:39.510
Take the petrol bombs!

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.110
No!

01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:51.910
Jang-beom!

01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:06.350
Jang-beom!

01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:01.190
Stop! Stop!

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:19.030
You! Why ain't you going home!

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:22.350
What about you!
Not going to school?

01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:25.270
Not today! Don't feel like it!

01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:39.790
Comrade Park! Comrade!

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:44.030
Look! The enemy's backup troops are here!

01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:46.550
You're a traitor!

01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:50.030
Retreat!

01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:51.310
Hey, comrade!

01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:02.190
I told you people get killed
because of their tongues.

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:06.270
1st platoon!

01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:08.990
Set up a line of defence!

01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:29.350
Jang-beom! 7 o'clock!

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:38.870
Jang-beom! Load this!

01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:44.180
Come on, you bastards!
Sons of bitches!

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.630
Hey, comrade!

01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:51.950
I hoped this adverse event wouldn't happen.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.430
But what can we do.

01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:58.670
You were born in South Korea,

01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:02.710
and I was born in the North.

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:10.390
Your sufferings are over
comrade Oh Jang-beom.

01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:34.350
Son of a bitch!

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:50.430
I'm so sorry.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.070
First you press power,
then set the frequency.

01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:19.830
Then you turn the volume up to hear.

01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:22.510
- What's this again?
- The frequency.

01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:25.350
No, it's the power button!

01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:29.360
Math whiz! Come here!

01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:32.270
- Thank you, sir.
- Sure.

01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:39.830
- You're in the way! Sit down!
- Sit down!

01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:12.510
Ready?

01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:14.510
One!

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:15.950
Two!

01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:17.100
Three!

01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:43.430
This story was based on
the 71 student soldiers

01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:48.070
who fought in the battle at Pohang Girls
Middle School on August 11th, 1950.

01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:55.550
The student soldiers kept
the North Koreans back for 11 hours,

01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:59.670
They played a key role in the Korean
and allied forces' counterattacks,

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:42.110
They said not to shoot
until we were given the order,

01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:49.510
but countless North Korean soldiers
charged in like a tidal wave.

01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:53.220
Seeing that, we got scared
and started shooting!

01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:57.790
They seized everywhere up to
Pohang Girls' Middle School.

01:56:57.880 --> 01:56:59.990
Bombs flew in from behind.

01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:03.230
They fired at us with
machine guns up front.

01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:06.510
They squeezed in on us.

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:09.750
They came up to 30 metres,

01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:11.350
firing machine guns,

01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:13.820
throwing grenades.

01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:18.550
Explosions went off all around
in a bloody battle.

01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:21.710
It hurts more not to be with them.

01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:28.790
I come here every year thinking about them.

01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:33.900
My friends who went before me.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.910
I wonder if I'll meet
them in the afterlife.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:44.510
I'm here thinking
and talking about them,

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:51.230
but it hurts to know they're all gone.
