WEBVTT

00:00.984 --> 00:02.045
Listen up.

00:02.063 --> 00:03.909
Any of youse goes stool-pigeon on me,

00:03.934 --> 00:06.256
you'll find yourself
in a Chicago overcoat.

00:06.281 --> 00:07.848
Honey, you're not gonna talk like that

00:07.873 --> 00:09.304
all the way to the wedding, are you?

00:09.329 --> 00:10.627
Or all the way to that overpass?

00:10.652 --> 00:12.186
Hey, at least you look cute.

00:12.211 --> 00:13.674
Who picked <i>my</i> outfit?

00:13.699 --> 00:15.189
I did.

00:15.290 --> 00:18.525
My dad and Lorraine decided
to have a 1920s-themed wedding.

00:18.550 --> 00:19.860
Such a romantic time.

00:19.961 --> 00:23.163
Yeah, dust bowls, the Klan, Prohibition.

00:24.723 --> 00:27.216
Oh, I'm... I'm sure
they'll have alcohol.

00:27.597 --> 00:28.897
Self-serve?

00:28.922 --> 00:31.824
I guess the grease monkeys
must be out back shooting dice.

00:31.849 --> 00:33.674
Can they come out here and shoot us?

00:33.699 --> 00:34.942
Oh, God, look down.

00:34.967 --> 00:36.034
Haley?

00:36.059 --> 00:37.745
We're going somewhere fancy, okay?

00:37.770 --> 00:38.946
Where, the past?

00:38.971 --> 00:39.990
Hi, Kimmy.

00:40.015 --> 00:41.849
You didn't feel like dressing up, too?

00:41.874 --> 00:43.576
What do you say those
pretty peepers of yours

00:43.601 --> 00:45.795
never saw the famous gangster Phillinger

00:45.820 --> 00:48.651
and his ex-prostitute getaway driver?

00:48.823 --> 00:51.225
I think a, uh... a
sawbuck should do the...

00:51.326 --> 00:53.089
That's too much. I'm
gonna get some change.

00:53.403 --> 00:55.269
Enjoy dress-up day.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.442
Mom, you need to control your man.

00:58.467 --> 01:00.069
I cannot listen to
this character all day.

01:00.094 --> 01:02.812
Guys, you know your dad.
You know your dad's dad.

01:02.837 --> 01:06.573
We are up against
unimaginable forces of goofy.

01:06.598 --> 01:09.667
Just remember he does it out of love.

01:09.669 --> 01:12.261
It's Johnny Law! Let's hot-foot it!

01:12.292 --> 01:13.493
Ohh!

01:13.518 --> 01:15.464
- (old-fashioned car horn honks)
- Phil!

01:29.495 --> 01:31.298
What the hell is all this?

01:31.323 --> 01:32.909
I got a rush order for my sauce,

01:32.934 --> 01:34.978
and the kitchen that I
usually use was booked,

01:35.003 --> 01:36.500
so I have to do everything myself.

01:36.525 --> 01:38.330
You know, I think I
slept funny last night.

01:38.370 --> 01:40.824
No, don't. I know better
than to ask for your help.

01:40.849 --> 01:43.707
Ah, good, 'cause I have a tee time.

01:43.708 --> 01:46.043
On the way, could you take
me to pick up my prom tux?

01:46.044 --> 01:47.377
That sounds like
something you'd love to do.

01:47.379 --> 01:48.378
(both laugh)

01:48.380 --> 01:50.318
I so don't want to do that.

01:50.343 --> 01:51.448
(laughs)

01:51.449 --> 01:53.016
I'm turning 70 next year.

01:53.018 --> 01:54.718
I know... I look great.

01:54.719 --> 01:56.653
One of the few perks of getting up there

01:56.654 --> 01:59.022
is the ability to say no without guilt.

01:59.057 --> 02:01.125
"Can I have a ride to the airport?" No.

02:01.126 --> 02:02.693
Do I want to see your niece's recital?

02:02.694 --> 02:03.827
Nuh-unh.

02:03.828 --> 02:05.629
"Want to do a walk-a-thon
to end global..."

02:05.630 --> 02:07.698
I'm gonna stop you right there.

02:07.699 --> 02:10.000
Was anyone in my room last night?

02:10.001 --> 02:11.719
Not after I tucked you in.

02:11.744 --> 02:13.770
Great. I have a monster.

02:13.772 --> 02:15.706
- I'm sure you're mistaken.
- Nope.

02:15.707 --> 02:18.642
And we have to catch him
before I go to bed tonight.

02:18.643 --> 02:21.311
Joe, there's no such thing as monsters.

02:21.312 --> 02:24.560
Calm down. I'm not
gonna ask you to help.

02:25.341 --> 02:27.618
Shaping up like a pretty good year.

02:27.619 --> 02:29.513
Cake for breakfast? Now we're talking.

02:29.538 --> 02:30.771
No, don't touch that!

02:30.796 --> 02:33.224
I'm making that for Uncle
Pepper's costume party tonight.

02:33.249 --> 02:34.848
The theme is famous movie duos.

02:34.873 --> 02:37.674
Daddy and I are going as
Leo and the "Revenant" bear.

02:37.699 --> 02:38.785
- (growls)
- You know what?

02:38.810 --> 02:39.910
Where is Pam?

02:39.911 --> 02:41.645
She said she was gonna
be here two hours ago.

02:41.646 --> 02:43.288
She has no respect
for anyone else's time.

02:43.313 --> 02:44.335
(mumbles indistinctly)

02:44.360 --> 02:47.484
You know, she says she's gonna
pop in for a "short stay."

02:47.485 --> 02:50.520
It's like we're just supposed
to rearrange our lives?

02:50.521 --> 02:52.489
Hmm. (mumbles indistinctly)

02:52.490 --> 02:54.858
It's taken me a long time,
but I've finally learned

02:54.859 --> 02:57.215
that when it comes to Cam's sister,

02:57.240 --> 03:00.831
anything I say can and
will be used against me.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.575
CAM: Do you think maybe
we should, you know,

03:02.600 --> 03:04.334
have the bartender cut Pam off?

03:04.335 --> 03:06.970
Oh, God, you know what? She
is getting a little bit messy.

03:06.971 --> 03:08.638
Uh, Pam, Mitchell thinks you're kind of

03:08.640 --> 03:10.179
making a fool out of yourself.

03:10.204 --> 03:12.094
Go to hell, Mitchell!

03:12.493 --> 03:15.412
You go straight to hell!

03:15.741 --> 03:18.543
Whoo!

03:19.417 --> 03:22.652
Well, her majesty has finally arrived.

03:22.654 --> 03:24.521
I can sense how angry you are.

03:24.522 --> 03:25.989
(mumbles indistinctly)

03:26.423 --> 03:28.000
I know. I know. I'm late.

03:28.025 --> 03:30.593
No, there's no late when you're family.

03:30.594 --> 03:32.188
Although Mitchell was just saying...

03:32.243 --> 03:33.477
So what brings you into town?

03:33.478 --> 03:34.805
- Modeling.
- Oh.

03:34.845 --> 03:35.978
I'm sorry. Modeling?

03:35.979 --> 03:37.413
Real-person modeling.

03:37.414 --> 03:40.249
Back home, they put me on a
billboard for the feed store,

03:40.284 --> 03:41.471
- and I caught the bug.
- Oh. Wow.

03:41.496 --> 03:43.085
Next stop... Hollywood.

03:43.086 --> 03:44.186
- (laughing) Okay.
- Wow.

03:44.187 --> 03:45.521
So how long are you gonna be in town?

03:45.522 --> 03:47.556
Well, who's to say?

03:47.557 --> 03:49.262
Well, I was hoping it'd be you.

03:49.287 --> 03:52.139
- You can't put a date on a dream.
- Mnh-mnh.

03:52.164 --> 03:54.707
Speaking of, we need to
take me to an audition,

03:54.732 --> 03:56.590
and I'm a little jittery,
so I was hoping you guys

03:56.615 --> 03:58.701
would want to ride
along for moral support.

03:58.702 --> 04:00.169
Oh, actually, Mitchell and I have a r...

04:00.170 --> 04:02.038
We have a really busy day.
Isn't that right, Mitchell?

04:02.039 --> 04:03.205
(mumbling) Uh, yeah.

04:03.206 --> 04:05.307
Oh, this won't take long. Let's go.

04:05.309 --> 04:08.564
On the ride over, I can
practice my joint-pain grimaces.

04:08.589 --> 04:10.157
- Hmm. Oh.
- Oh!

04:10.182 --> 04:11.814
- Ohh!
- Are you okay?

04:11.815 --> 04:13.120
- I am! I am!
- (laughs) Oh, yeah, I know.

04:13.145 --> 04:14.258
You're good. You're good.

04:16.291 --> 04:17.515
(grunts)

04:20.892 --> 04:22.346
- (fabric tears)
- Ohh!

04:22.371 --> 04:23.692
Again?!

04:23.694 --> 04:27.025
Joe hasn't slept in that
chewed-up sweater snagger in years,

04:27.026 --> 04:29.007
but Gloria won't let
me get rid of anything

04:29.032 --> 04:31.567
the kid has ever touched,
so I needed a plan.

04:31.568 --> 04:34.437
Fortunately, when you
say no to everything,

04:34.438 --> 04:38.441
it frees up time to
concoct ingenious schemes.

04:38.891 --> 04:41.225
Look, Joe, there's no monsters anywhere.

04:41.250 --> 04:43.312
There's nothing underneath the bed,

04:43.313 --> 04:45.764
nothing inside the teepee.

04:45.789 --> 04:46.882
Are you sure?

04:46.883 --> 04:49.485
Yes, monsters need places to hide.

04:49.486 --> 04:50.906
They're not like the evil spirits,

04:50.931 --> 04:52.354
which are all around us.

04:52.356 --> 04:54.537
- What?
- No, no, nothing, baby.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.659
- Nothing.
- Look, my window's open!

04:56.660 --> 04:58.326
Maybe that's how he got in.

04:58.351 --> 04:59.428
Impossible.

04:59.429 --> 05:00.796
If he came across the roof,

05:00.797 --> 05:04.414
there'd be broken tiles
or monster prints or...

05:04.634 --> 05:06.235
My monogrammed money clip.

05:06.236 --> 05:08.007
I snuck in through
Joe's window last night

05:08.032 --> 05:09.529
because it was past curfew,

05:09.554 --> 05:11.382
and I must have dropped
my clip on the roof.

05:11.407 --> 05:13.109
I needed to get it before Mom saw.

05:13.110 --> 05:14.755
I can't afford to get grounded.

05:14.780 --> 05:16.469
David Sedaris is coming
to Barnes and Noble

05:16.494 --> 05:17.660
on a school night.

05:17.835 --> 05:20.990
I guess I can go out on the roof
and check for monster slobber.

05:21.015 --> 05:22.929
- Okay.
- No!

05:22.956 --> 05:25.481
If he falls from the roof and dies,

05:25.506 --> 05:27.507
his ghost will haunt you forever.

05:27.508 --> 05:30.554
Oh, boy. I do not need a ghost.

05:30.579 --> 05:32.712
Manny, help me out in the garage.

05:32.713 --> 05:34.714
Do I get to say no to
things I don't want to do?

05:34.715 --> 05:36.119
No, at your age, it's unlikable.

05:36.144 --> 05:37.705
At my age, it's delightful.

05:37.730 --> 05:39.519
Can you get those Easter
decorations down for me?

05:39.520 --> 05:40.541
I don't know if you remember,

05:40.565 --> 05:42.332
but my back's been bothering me lately.

05:42.535 --> 05:45.036
Uh, do I need to change my shirt?

05:45.061 --> 05:46.502
It looks cobwebby up there.

05:46.527 --> 05:48.494
No, just give it a tug.

05:48.495 --> 05:50.626
You know, I never realized
how close to the edge

05:50.674 --> 05:54.266
that cinder block is to falling
right on this beautiful crib.

05:56.491 --> 05:57.671
Whoa!

05:58.066 --> 05:59.260
Son of a...!

05:59.285 --> 06:01.525
- You got to be kidding me!
- (fabric tears)

06:01.550 --> 06:02.975
Come on!

06:02.977 --> 06:05.931
(slow-tempo jazz music plays)

06:05.956 --> 06:08.181
Quite the shindig, huh?

06:08.182 --> 06:09.470
You mooks cool your heels.

06:09.502 --> 06:11.202
I'll grab some hooch for this parakeet.

06:11.203 --> 06:12.203
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:12.204 --> 06:14.672
Phil, why are we the
only ones in costume?

06:14.697 --> 06:16.322
Oh, you're right, doll.

06:16.347 --> 06:17.384
Something's screwy.

06:17.409 --> 06:20.281
The invitation clearly said
"gangster attire optional."

06:20.306 --> 06:22.345
- Optional?!
- Ow!

06:22.370 --> 06:24.484
You dumbasses actually did it!

06:24.509 --> 06:25.950
Jerry, get this!

06:25.951 --> 06:27.452
- No, Jerry, don't get this.
- (laughs)

06:27.453 --> 06:29.954
(normal voice) Uh, everyone,
this is Lorraine's son, Ray.

06:29.965 --> 06:33.100
Mother-daughter... my
favorite search category.

06:33.125 --> 06:34.975
Shouldn't you be partially upright

06:35.000 --> 06:36.728
on a "stages of man" chart somewhere?

06:36.729 --> 06:37.873
- What?
- Yeah.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.186
Honey, you need to hear this right now.

06:40.211 --> 06:41.466
Your family's embarrassed.

06:41.467 --> 06:42.734
We're the only ones in costumes.

06:42.735 --> 06:43.901
You do this all the time.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.169
I'm wearing wool underwear.

06:45.171 --> 06:47.272
That's an extra step you chose to take.

06:47.273 --> 06:49.412
I'm sorry. I thought this would be fun.

06:49.437 --> 06:52.510
Yes, but your idea of fun is
often our idea of a horror show.

06:52.511 --> 06:54.973
When you picked me up from
school in that hot-dog car.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.967
Repeatedly screaming, "That's
what I'm talking about!"

06:56.992 --> 06:58.176
- at my graduation.
- (groans)

06:58.201 --> 07:00.018
Walking into my science fair on stilts.

07:00.019 --> 07:02.833
Your exhibit was on daddy
longlegs. I had no choice!

07:02.858 --> 07:04.455
Oh, honey, you always have a choice.

07:04.456 --> 07:07.076
You just keep making the wrong ones.

07:07.693 --> 07:09.217
Guys.

07:09.242 --> 07:10.723
Come on, now.

07:10.748 --> 07:13.064
Well, look, it's Pretty Boy Dunphy.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.832
- (chuckles)
- Looking good yourself, Pops.

07:14.833 --> 07:16.434
How, uh... how you doing?

07:16.435 --> 07:18.236
Well, I got my rings, got my vows.

07:18.237 --> 07:20.305
Now all I need is a way to escape.

07:20.306 --> 07:22.399
- Please, someone help.
- (laughs)

07:22.424 --> 07:23.858
I'm kidding, of course.

07:23.883 --> 07:26.611
Actually, I'm really looking
forward to being married.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.179
Then... then what's
with the getaway bag?

07:28.180 --> 07:29.789
Oh, I got to ask you to help me out

07:29.814 --> 07:32.219
with what I think is
a doozy of a surprise.

07:32.244 --> 07:33.359
Come here.

07:33.384 --> 07:35.353
Get this... mid-ceremony,
you know, when you ask

07:35.387 --> 07:37.290
- if anyone has any objections?
- Yeah?

07:37.315 --> 07:39.009
I'm gonna pull out a Tommy gun

07:39.034 --> 07:40.958
and tell you to skip that part.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.960
Sweet maple syrup. I like it.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.780
I'm just getting warmed
up. I got a script,

07:44.805 --> 07:46.664
prop guns, exploding paint capsules.

07:46.665 --> 07:49.667
I even hired a few of the local
theater people to help out.

07:49.668 --> 07:52.637
And, uh... and Lorraine's
cool with all this?

07:52.638 --> 07:54.906
That's the beauty part. She
doesn't know a thing about it.

07:54.907 --> 07:56.841
80% of comedy is surprise.

07:56.842 --> 07:59.210
The other 20% is wordplay.

07:59.211 --> 08:00.611
(both chuckle)

08:01.780 --> 08:03.117
Something wrong, son?

08:03.142 --> 08:04.798
I think this might be a terrible idea.

08:04.823 --> 08:05.906
What do you mean?

08:05.931 --> 08:07.884
Lorraine might be one of
those old-fashioned brides

08:07.909 --> 08:10.601
that doesn't want a body
count on her special day.

08:10.626 --> 08:12.697
Dad, you and I like to have fun,

08:12.722 --> 08:14.324
but not everybody's like us.

08:14.326 --> 08:15.806
Some people...

08:15.831 --> 08:17.995
some people think our brand
of humor is embarrassing.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.531
Oh, you're right. Maybe I do overdo it.

08:20.532 --> 08:24.182
I remember your mother was really
ticked off at me at your baptism

08:24.207 --> 08:27.187
when I kept pretending
the holy water was boiling.

08:27.212 --> 08:29.001
- (laughs)
- Ouch! Ouch!

08:29.026 --> 08:31.972
Okay, we don't have to
do anything crazy today.

08:31.997 --> 08:33.745
- Don't worry about it.
- Thanks, Pops.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.346
But, wait, you're still
gonna do my funeral

08:35.347 --> 08:36.914
the way we talked about, right?

08:36.914 --> 08:38.750
That recording of you
banging on that piece of wood

08:38.751 --> 08:41.034
- screaming, "Let me out of here!"
- (laughs)

08:41.058 --> 08:43.660
It's a real shame I'm gonna miss that.

08:44.684 --> 08:45.864
What are you doing?

08:45.889 --> 08:47.755
That accident that Manny caused earlier,

08:47.793 --> 08:48.960
gave me quite a start.

08:48.993 --> 08:50.442
So I figured I'd pull everything out

08:50.467 --> 08:52.190
and put it back in a safer fashion.

08:52.215 --> 08:54.332
Gloria, could you plug this in for me?

08:54.357 --> 08:55.957
I want to dust off some of this stuff.

08:55.982 --> 08:57.695
Did you call me outside just for that?

08:57.720 --> 08:59.223
I got a back situation.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.004
Maybe Manny mentioned it.

09:02.410 --> 09:04.809
- (leaf blower whirring)
- Oh, no! Wrong cord!

09:04.834 --> 09:07.019
- (horn honks)
- What have you done?

09:07.044 --> 09:09.590
(horn honks, tires screech)

09:10.777 --> 09:13.835
Geez, it seems like Joe's
crib's damaged beyond repair!

09:13.870 --> 09:15.184
No, no, it's fine.

09:15.209 --> 09:17.610
It just Froggered across the street.

09:17.635 --> 09:19.870
Leave it there. The garbage
man is coming tomorrow.

09:19.895 --> 09:21.215
And you're fine with that?

09:21.240 --> 09:23.408
You're attached to everything
related to that kid.

09:23.433 --> 09:25.316
Yeah, but not to that stupid crib.

09:25.332 --> 09:28.207
Do you know how many clothes
I've ruined walking by it...

09:28.239 --> 09:30.332
nice dresses, sweaters,
a pair of high heels?

09:30.691 --> 09:32.008
How do you snag a pair of high heels?

09:32.009 --> 09:33.536
I kicked that stupid thing.

09:33.561 --> 09:34.786
- How else?
- (thud)

09:34.811 --> 09:36.471
- MANNY: Oh!
- Ay!

09:36.496 --> 09:37.957
My trap worked!

09:37.982 --> 09:39.872
I caught the monster!

09:41.285 --> 09:43.316
I got you now, monster!

09:43.341 --> 09:45.596
Wait, wait, wait,
stop! It's me... Manny.

09:45.621 --> 09:47.857
Prove it. Do I like vegetables?

09:47.858 --> 09:49.682
Only with ketchup.

09:49.707 --> 09:51.261
Manny, what are you doing here?

09:51.262 --> 09:53.465
Uh, I just needed a place to practice

09:53.490 --> 09:55.754
some new dance moves for the prom.

09:56.035 --> 09:58.051
- Do it.
- What?

09:58.076 --> 09:59.715
Do the dance moves.

10:01.569 --> 10:03.035
Uh...

10:05.099 --> 10:07.235
I have to admit that that is very good.

10:07.260 --> 10:08.912
But I know that you're lying.

10:08.913 --> 10:09.916
(sighs)

10:09.941 --> 10:10.953
Fine.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.615
I was the one in here last night.

10:12.616 --> 10:14.751
I came in through the window
because I broke curfew.

10:14.752 --> 10:17.453
I dropped my money clip, and I
was just trying to get it back.

10:17.455 --> 10:19.556
Forget about going to David Sedaris.

10:19.557 --> 10:20.853
(gasps)

10:21.064 --> 10:22.666
I was wrong, Joe.

10:22.691 --> 10:24.892
There <i>is</i> a monster in this room.

10:26.957 --> 10:28.841
The key to real-person modeling

10:28.866 --> 10:32.002
is not to attract a lot
of attention to yourself.

10:32.595 --> 10:33.764
This is me...

10:33.812 --> 10:35.139
- thinking about buying a car.
- Uh-huh.

10:35.206 --> 10:37.473
This is me with a toothache, obviously.

10:37.475 --> 10:38.641
Oh, this is me smart.

10:38.642 --> 10:40.210
- What was that, Mitchell?
- I didn't say anything.

10:40.211 --> 10:42.212
I thought you said something
about that we had a busy day.

10:42.213 --> 10:44.214
No. No, I'm just happy to be here

10:44.215 --> 10:45.565
watching a career get launched.

10:45.590 --> 10:46.620
- Oh.
- Yeah.

10:46.645 --> 10:48.230
Hey, tell me if they call my name.

10:48.255 --> 10:49.587
I'm gonna go pretty down.

10:49.620 --> 10:50.909
- Mm.
- Okay.

10:50.934 --> 10:52.167
Can you believe her?

10:52.192 --> 10:54.089
She just barges into
our life and expects us

10:54.114 --> 10:56.548
to drop everything and
invest in this crazy dream.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.683
Well, she really does look like
someone who just broke her mop.

10:58.707 --> 11:00.283
Okay, what is going on with you?

11:00.308 --> 11:02.318
I'm not doing it anymore, Cam, okay?

11:02.343 --> 11:04.978
Okay, you're too afraid to
confront your big, scary sister,

11:05.003 --> 11:06.346
so you use me to do it.

11:06.371 --> 11:07.671
Well, I'm out, okay?

11:07.672 --> 11:09.620
Until you learn how to
confront her yourself,

11:09.645 --> 11:10.907
you're never gonna get
the respect from her

11:10.908 --> 11:12.448
that you clearly crave.

11:12.473 --> 11:15.775
Okay, you know what? I am not in
the least bit intimidated by her.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.981
PAM: "Her" who?

11:16.982 --> 11:18.482
Oh, the lady at the costume store that,

11:18.483 --> 11:19.730
uh, M-Mitchell's pressuring me

11:19.755 --> 11:20.855
to go pick up the costumes right now.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.186
I go... Okay, I'm going, Mitchell.

11:22.187 --> 11:23.654
My gosh. My gosh.

11:23.655 --> 11:24.715
(sighs)

11:24.740 --> 11:25.789
Hey, give me a dollar

11:25.791 --> 11:27.465
- so I can get me some gum.
- Oh.

11:27.490 --> 11:29.018
- Here.
- Thank you.

11:29.043 --> 11:31.111
My God, you're perfect.

11:31.136 --> 11:32.730
(gasps) It's happening!

11:32.755 --> 11:35.256
You're absolutely unremarkable!

11:35.281 --> 11:36.767
Terry, get out here!

11:36.768 --> 11:39.426
This better not be
another false... (gasps)

11:39.816 --> 11:42.412
I can't not take my eyes off him.

11:42.437 --> 11:44.371
Oh, I'm... I'm not here to audition.

11:44.396 --> 11:45.550
Say that again.

11:45.575 --> 11:47.549
Yes, I've already
forgotten what you said.

11:47.574 --> 11:48.610
(sighs)

11:48.611 --> 11:50.887
When they made him, they kept the mold.

11:54.426 --> 11:57.019
Are you looking at me?
Are you looking at me?

11:57.020 --> 11:58.387
Please tell me you're
doing a scene from a movie

11:58.388 --> 12:00.519
and not confused about what a mirror is.

12:00.652 --> 12:02.237
- Hi, honey. What's that?
- (siren wailing in distance)

12:02.262 --> 12:04.635
A bag of plastic guns.

12:04.660 --> 12:06.995
My dad was planning this
crazy stunt at the wedding

12:06.996 --> 12:08.924
that Lorraine didn't even know about.

12:08.949 --> 12:10.596
There's a whole script
for it and everything.

12:10.621 --> 12:12.909
Don't worry. I talked him out of it.

12:12.934 --> 12:14.468
No more embarrassing the Dunphys today.

12:14.469 --> 12:17.138
I heard what you guys said,
and I'm... I'm truly sorry.

12:17.139 --> 12:18.772
- (ringtone playing)
- Oh, quick.

12:19.019 --> 12:21.709
What nickname did Jennifer
Lopez steal from Jon Lovitz?

12:21.710 --> 12:23.340
J... Never mind.

12:23.365 --> 12:25.246
Hello? Yes, the rings.

12:25.271 --> 12:28.473
Wow. He didn't say "J-Lo."

12:28.498 --> 12:30.402
He also heard that siren and didn't say,

12:30.427 --> 12:31.593
"There's my ride."

12:31.618 --> 12:32.885
Did we break Dad?

12:32.910 --> 12:34.410
And when was the last time you saw him

12:34.426 --> 12:35.553
pick up a can of whipped cream

12:35.554 --> 12:37.960
and not do his "I've got rabies" gag?

12:37.985 --> 12:39.886
Oh, my God. Did we go too far?

12:39.911 --> 12:41.386
Have we knocked the fun out of him?

12:41.411 --> 12:43.288
No, no, no. Stop this thinking.

12:43.313 --> 12:44.680
We are this close to
having a normal dad,

12:44.705 --> 12:46.906
- and you are not ruining it.
- (knock on door)

12:46.931 --> 12:49.719
Hey, guys, can I have
Claire for a second?

12:49.720 --> 12:50.899
Sure.

12:53.594 --> 12:56.162
Ew, they're spending their
wedding night right next door?

12:56.226 --> 12:57.827
Calm down. The loudest noise

12:57.828 --> 13:00.529
you're gonna hear is Grandpa
getting out of a chair.

13:00.531 --> 13:01.831
- You look great.
- Oh.

13:01.832 --> 13:02.965
How are you feeling?

13:02.966 --> 13:04.800
Well, you'd think on my fourth marriage,

13:04.802 --> 13:06.102
I wouldn't be this nervous.

13:06.103 --> 13:07.970
Ah, I guess it never gets easier.

13:07.971 --> 13:10.870
I remember my wedding. My stomach
was filled with butterflies.

13:10.895 --> 13:13.004
And Haley. (chuckles)

13:13.510 --> 13:15.311
I've always married such serious men.

13:15.312 --> 13:17.380
Frank is not that at all.

13:17.381 --> 13:20.137
Oh, I know, but if
you can see past that.

13:20.162 --> 13:21.199
Past that?

13:21.224 --> 13:23.830
Yeah, he's got a lot of
wonderful qualities, too.

13:23.854 --> 13:25.761
Oh, sweetie, you're missing it.

13:25.786 --> 13:29.183
All my ex-husbands were
accomplished, serious men,

13:29.208 --> 13:30.526
but bone-dry.

13:30.527 --> 13:33.550
A day hasn't gone by that
Frank hasn't made me laugh.

13:33.575 --> 13:34.630
(chuckles)

13:34.655 --> 13:36.065
I hope I keep up.

13:36.090 --> 13:38.257
- Oh.
- But who am I telling? (chuckles)

13:38.259 --> 13:39.726
You got lucky, too.

13:41.485 --> 13:42.618
(grunts)

13:47.743 --> 13:49.712
Sweet victory!

13:54.381 --> 13:55.648
(laughter)

13:55.649 --> 13:57.079
MANNY: Okay, wait, wait.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.938
- Charge!
- No, no, no!

13:58.963 --> 14:00.768
Not my hair!

14:00.793 --> 14:02.516
Not my hair!

14:02.541 --> 14:03.822
What are you doing? What are you...?

14:03.824 --> 14:06.071
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's going on?

14:06.096 --> 14:08.464
Oh, nothing. We're painting Joe's wall

14:08.489 --> 14:11.224
with monster repellent to protect him.

14:11.249 --> 14:12.853
- Looks like you're having fun, huh?
- Honey, don't worry.

14:12.878 --> 14:14.738
We're not gonna ask you to do anything.

14:14.763 --> 14:16.163
The trick to the corners is if you...

14:16.164 --> 14:17.431
Yeah, yeah, we got it.

14:17.432 --> 14:19.300
Go fix yourself a drink!

14:19.301 --> 14:20.434
(laughter)

14:20.435 --> 14:21.836
GLORIA: "Fix yourself a drink."

14:21.837 --> 14:23.037
Right there, right there, Joe.

14:23.038 --> 14:24.337
(laughs)

14:26.571 --> 14:27.975
The thing about saying no...

14:27.976 --> 14:29.977
you say it too much...

14:31.398 --> 14:33.461
people just stop asking.

14:33.615 --> 14:35.683
(laughter in distance)

14:38.854 --> 14:40.354
- (door closes)
- You stole my dream.

14:40.355 --> 14:42.690
Okay, would you please stop saying that?

14:42.691 --> 14:44.392
If you hadn't distracted those ninnies

14:44.393 --> 14:46.267
with your striking regularness,

14:46.292 --> 14:48.634
they would have put <i>me</i>
in a national TV ad campaign

14:48.659 --> 14:50.131
instead of neither of us!

14:50.132 --> 14:51.666
Why are you flipping out?

14:51.667 --> 14:54.268
I-I am not in competition with you.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.537
Oh, so now you think I'm crazy?!

14:56.538 --> 14:59.098
- N-No.
- Well, maybe I <i>am</i> crazy,

14:59.123 --> 15:00.775
but I have a damn good reason.

15:00.776 --> 15:02.610
Connect the dots, you dummy.

15:02.611 --> 15:04.172
I'm wearing real loose clothes.

15:04.197 --> 15:05.890
I need money real bad.

15:05.916 --> 15:08.952
My hair is lustrous like a lion's mane.

15:08.977 --> 15:10.451
Uh, you're in love?

15:10.452 --> 15:13.031
No, the opposite! I'm pregnant!

15:13.056 --> 15:14.639
Okay. Oh, God.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.501
The family didn't want me to
get back together with Beau

15:17.526 --> 15:20.127
on account of he's six-parts
Chicopee and married,

15:20.128 --> 15:22.083
but I did it anyway,
and now he's in County

15:22.108 --> 15:24.255
for punching a police horse in the face.

15:24.280 --> 15:26.130
And if they find out,
then they'll just know

15:26.155 --> 15:29.103
that everyone was right about
me being such a screw-up.

15:29.104 --> 15:31.404
Oh, Pam, I-I had no idea.

15:31.429 --> 15:33.178
I mean, how many months along are you?

15:33.179 --> 15:34.840
- Oh, all of them.
- All of them.

15:34.865 --> 15:37.211
Yeah, go ahead. Condemn me.

15:37.212 --> 15:40.678
I can see the judgment all
over that generic face of yours.

15:41.725 --> 15:44.719
This strap is cutting
into me like a piano wire.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.587
Would you mind going through my luggage

15:46.588 --> 15:48.564
and pulling out my after-dinner bra?

15:48.589 --> 15:49.989
- If I must.
- (door opens)

15:50.014 --> 15:51.536
CAM: I'm home!

15:51.561 --> 15:53.973
I didn't get picked. Thanks for asking.

15:53.998 --> 15:56.643
Well, I have good news.

15:56.668 --> 15:59.498
Mitchell and I are early contenders

15:59.523 --> 16:01.866
to win the best costume

16:01.891 --> 16:04.990
in the human/animal category.

16:05.504 --> 16:06.920
What are you doing?

16:06.945 --> 16:08.864
Self-comforting with food.

16:08.889 --> 16:10.365
I've been working on that all morning,

16:10.374 --> 16:11.741
and it is for a party tonight.

16:11.742 --> 16:13.686
What are a bunch of
gays gonna do with a cake

16:13.711 --> 16:16.045
but stand around screeching
about how pretty it is?

16:16.046 --> 16:17.446
Okay, that's it.

16:17.447 --> 16:19.559
Pam, you are rude.

16:19.584 --> 16:20.678
You are disrespectful.

16:20.703 --> 16:21.917
And you are going in for another bite?!

16:21.918 --> 16:24.520
Put the fork down! Put it down!

16:24.521 --> 16:27.131
It is high time that
you start thinking...

16:27.156 --> 16:29.528
about somebody other than yourself!

16:29.553 --> 16:31.894
Oh. So that's how you feel?

16:31.895 --> 16:33.229
Yes, it is.

16:33.230 --> 16:35.826
Then I guess it is on!

16:35.851 --> 16:36.850
Don't. No!

16:36.875 --> 16:38.209
- You better run!
- No!

16:38.639 --> 16:40.636
Get off of me! I wasn't ready!

16:40.637 --> 16:42.171
Then get ready for this!

16:42.172 --> 16:44.318
(grunting)

16:44.897 --> 16:46.889
Hey! Cut it out!

16:46.914 --> 16:48.181
Hey! That hurts!

16:48.206 --> 16:50.326
Good, then it's working!

16:50.531 --> 16:51.660
(groaning)

16:51.685 --> 16:54.517
Oh, cut it out, you faker.
I'm not even touching you.

16:54.542 --> 16:56.276
I assume it's this one.
Oh, what are you doing?

16:56.301 --> 16:57.897
- She's pregnant!
- What?!

16:57.922 --> 16:59.698
- (laughs)
- Hey! Hey!

16:59.723 --> 17:00.857
- Cut it out!
- Oh! Oh!

17:00.882 --> 17:01.942
- Ow!
- Okay, okay.

17:01.967 --> 17:04.026
Oh, no, I think my water just broke.

17:04.027 --> 17:05.493
Is it on me?!

17:05.494 --> 17:08.020
I'm fixing to reproduce right now!

17:08.045 --> 17:09.207
Call 811.

17:09.232 --> 17:10.465
No, Mitchell, that's for livestock.

17:10.467 --> 17:11.490
Call 911.

17:11.515 --> 17:12.801
Yeah, I-I know. I know.

17:12.803 --> 17:15.637
Pamela, why didn't you tell me?

17:15.638 --> 17:17.006
Well, why do you think?

17:17.007 --> 17:18.840
I didn't want to disappoint you.

17:19.045 --> 17:22.021
You know you're the person
I look up to mo-o-o-o-o-st...

17:22.047 --> 17:23.417
Whoa! Oh, my gosh.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.247
- ... in the family.
- I am?

17:25.248 --> 17:27.608
- Why do you think I came here?
- Oh.

17:27.633 --> 17:30.419
I wanted to be near you
when the baby po... Aah!

17:30.420 --> 17:31.982
Ow!

17:32.959 --> 17:35.124
But I thought maybe
if I got a job first,

17:35.125 --> 17:38.194
I wouldn't look like such
a pathetic me-e-e-e-ss!

17:38.228 --> 17:39.562
Ow!

17:39.563 --> 17:40.863
(breathing heavily)

17:40.864 --> 17:43.165
- What?
- I'm so cold, Cam!

17:43.166 --> 17:44.981
Oh, oh, here, put on
Mitchell's bear costume.

17:45.006 --> 17:46.335
Here you go. Come on.

17:46.336 --> 17:49.705
Okay, so they are gonna
be here in, uh, 10 minutes.

17:49.706 --> 17:50.873
I'll never make it!

17:50.898 --> 17:51.907
- Okay.
- It's a-coming!

17:51.908 --> 17:54.068
Okay! Mitchell! Mitchell, okay.

17:54.093 --> 17:55.220
It's all right. We're here for you.

17:55.245 --> 17:56.647
- Help me get her pants off.
- Okay. Yes.

17:56.672 --> 17:58.581
All right, we need to get some
pillows up underneath her hips

17:58.582 --> 18:00.983
to get her birthing
canal properly angled.

18:00.984 --> 18:02.061
- Yeah!
- All right, here we go.

18:02.086 --> 18:02.985
- Relax.
- (breathing rapidly)

18:02.986 --> 18:04.068
Mitchell!

18:04.093 --> 18:05.582
I want to make sure that
they don't miss the house,

18:05.607 --> 18:07.897
- so I'm just gonna...
- Breathe, breathe.

18:07.998 --> 18:11.512
Frank and Lorraine, today
marks the public and legal

18:11.537 --> 18:14.330
joining of your souls,
marriage being above all else,

18:14.331 --> 18:15.684
a contract.

18:15.709 --> 18:16.771
(coughs)

18:17.391 --> 18:19.902
Uh, one of my favorite
authors once wrote,

18:19.903 --> 18:22.037
"If love is not all, then it is nothing.

18:22.038 --> 18:24.475
"This principle, and its opposite,

18:24.500 --> 18:27.836
"collide down all the years
of... of my breathless tale."

18:27.861 --> 18:29.272
(yawns)

18:29.297 --> 18:32.815
Seeing Phil bomb up there,
I felt like a mama bird

18:32.816 --> 18:34.717
who had just nudged her
chick out of the nest

18:34.718 --> 18:37.137
without a single pun to break his fall.

18:37.162 --> 18:40.823
"For man can no more
survive without love

18:40.824 --> 18:42.992
"than a cooper without his billhook,

18:42.993 --> 18:45.764
"nor a whaler less his flensing knife."

18:45.789 --> 18:47.429
Words as true today as they were

18:47.430 --> 18:49.231
when they were written 18,000 years ago.

18:49.232 --> 18:50.436
That can't be right.

18:50.790 --> 18:53.345
Now is the moment when
I ask if anyone here

18:53.370 --> 18:56.872
has reason to object to the
union of these two people.

18:57.826 --> 18:59.475
- Thank you.
- I object!

18:59.476 --> 19:01.358
I object to you not handing over

19:01.383 --> 19:02.931
those diamond rings, Preacher!

19:02.956 --> 19:04.022
(as gangster) You heard her.

19:04.047 --> 19:06.670
Hand over the ice, or I
fill you full of... leed.

19:06.695 --> 19:08.615
- Lead.
- Honey, what are you doing?

19:08.640 --> 19:10.334
Sorry, <i>Padre,</i> you had your chance.

19:10.359 --> 19:12.178
I now pronounce you dead!

19:12.203 --> 19:13.604
(scattered gasps)

19:13.663 --> 19:15.030
When in the world did...

19:15.031 --> 19:17.332
A lot of questions for a cadaver!

19:17.333 --> 19:18.400
(spectators murmuring)

19:18.401 --> 19:19.920
Ohh! Ohh!

19:19.945 --> 19:21.903
Don't you see? These
twos is in on it together!

19:21.904 --> 19:23.872
Mind your own potatoes, Daisy.

19:23.873 --> 19:25.881
- Ohh!
- Excuse me.

19:25.906 --> 19:28.753
This is my wedding and your funeral!

19:28.778 --> 19:31.889
- Ohh!
- And one for the choir boy!

19:32.147 --> 19:33.842
- Missed me.
- (groans)

19:34.969 --> 19:36.443
(laughter)

19:37.740 --> 19:41.631
Hey, uh, you guys feel like
doing one more paint job?

19:41.656 --> 19:44.024
Only all of us this time?

19:44.631 --> 19:46.094
- Sure.
- (chuckles)

19:46.095 --> 19:48.630
PHIL: Sometimes life can
be simpler than we think.

19:48.631 --> 19:49.670
We're born...

19:49.695 --> 19:51.600
You know, um, maybe we
should let Pam and the baby

19:51.601 --> 19:53.764
stay upstairs for a little while.

19:54.389 --> 19:56.934
Mitchell was just saying...
No, he hates when I do that.

19:56.959 --> 19:58.940
I was just saying that
maybe you and the baby

19:58.941 --> 20:00.709
should stay upstairs for a while?

20:00.710 --> 20:02.342
Oh, Cam!

20:02.367 --> 20:03.467
PHIL: ... we die...

20:03.492 --> 20:05.623
You're all mad with the devil's brew!

20:06.240 --> 20:08.189
- (laughter)
- ... and in between...

20:08.214 --> 20:10.029
- Ah!
- ... if we're lucky...

20:10.225 --> 20:11.514
... we laugh...

20:12.833 --> 20:15.475
... which makes the
journey worth taking.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.215
With that in mind...

20:17.240 --> 20:20.912
Do you, Frank Dunphy,
the silliest man I know...

20:20.937 --> 20:22.029
(laughs)

20:22.054 --> 20:24.660
... take Lorraine to be
your long-suffering wife?

20:24.685 --> 20:26.506
- I do.
- Ohh.

20:27.097 --> 20:29.107
You may kiss the tomato.

20:31.434 --> 20:32.717
Yay!

20:33.443 --> 20:36.044
(applause)

20:37.740 --> 20:40.685
Your bedtime was an hour ago, señor.

20:40.716 --> 20:42.278
I want to finish this.

20:42.303 --> 20:44.271
You don't even know how to read.

20:44.296 --> 20:46.427
Stop worrying. There's
no monsters upstairs.

20:46.452 --> 20:47.955
That paint works.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.757
Mommy, can you check it?

20:49.758 --> 20:51.224
Okay.

20:51.249 --> 20:52.513
(chuckles)

20:52.538 --> 20:55.005
Your mother won't even let me
get rid of this sticky, old tarp.

20:55.030 --> 20:56.464
She's attached to everything.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.499
Someday soon, that
will work in your favor.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.535
(chuckles)

20:59.560 --> 21:01.035
Hey, careful of that cinder block.

21:01.036 --> 21:02.951
Man, you couldn't budge
that thing with a...

21:02.976 --> 21:04.238
Oh!

21:04.239 --> 21:06.161
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Oh!

21:06.186 --> 21:09.349
(shouting in distance)

21:12.031 --> 21:15.634
Great! Now I have a swamp monster!
