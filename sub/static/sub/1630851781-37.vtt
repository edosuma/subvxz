keeping it fun *

00:03.871 --> 00:05.506

00:05.573 --> 00:08.176

00:08.242 --> 00:09.643
* Hey *

00:09.710 --> 00:11.379
* Gear up and go
in the Glam Van *

00:11.445 --> 00:12.880
* Hair styling
with her best friends *

00:12.946 --> 00:15.816
* It's Sunny,
yeah, she's Sunny *

00:15.883 --> 00:18.519
* Oh, it's a Sunny Day *

00:18.586 --> 00:21.422
* She'll put a smile
on your face *

00:21.489 --> 00:22.823
- Whoo-hoo!

00:22.890 --> 00:27.261

[bright music]

00:41.041 --> 00:41.975
[giggling]

00:42.042 --> 00:43.010
- Hair dryer.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.512
- Hair dryer.

00:44.578 --> 00:45.513
- Comb.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.580
- Comb.

00:46.647 --> 00:50.050

00:50.118 --> 00:51.652
- [laughs]

00:51.719 --> 00:54.822

00:54.888 --> 00:56.357
- Ribbon.
- Ribbon.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.858
- [squeaks]
- Oopsie.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.960
Sorry, Rosie.
Here you go.

01:00.027 --> 01:01.595
- [squeaks]

01:03.864 --> 01:04.832
- All set.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.400
- I love it.

01:06.467 --> 01:07.535
- Thanks, Sunny.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.138
- No problem.
Have a sunny day.

01:10.204 --> 01:13.841
Madison, you're up next.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.143
- Hi, Scratch.

01:15.209 --> 01:18.679
[gasps]
Oh, you're so cute.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.080
- No time to chat, Blair.

01:20.148 --> 01:22.150
We're here for some
puppy grooming.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.451
A Maltese should look its best

01:23.517 --> 01:25.219
if we're gonna find
a forever home.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.721
I'll be back later to pick
them up.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.190
- Hang on, "them?"

01:29.257 --> 01:31.392
- [barks]
- Huh?

01:31.459 --> 01:35.796
One, two, three, four,
five, six--lots of dogs.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.498
[sighs]

01:37.565 --> 01:39.233
- [barking]
- [giggles]

01:39.300 --> 01:41.034
I'll take them to
the pet parlor.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.503
Come on, puppies.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.205
[barking]

01:44.272 --> 01:46.174
- We're here for our 2:00 p.m.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.108
KC needs grooming.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.178
- Oh, hi, Lacey.
Hi, KC.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.446
Blair will be right with you.

01:52.513 --> 01:53.381
- [grunts]

01:53.447 --> 01:55.015
- Hi, Lacey.
Hi, KC.

01:55.082 --> 01:56.217
Sorry for the wait.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.018
Let me check you in.

01:58.085 --> 02:00.388
Yes, here it is.
pet parlor, 2:00 p.m.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.391
I'm sorry, Lacey, we're running
a little behind today,

02:03.457 --> 02:05.759
if you don't mind waiting.

02:07.261 --> 02:10.364
- Hmm.
So busy.

02:10.431 --> 02:13.367
Maybe we don't have to wait.

02:13.434 --> 02:17.405
Come on, KC, to the pet parlor.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.806
[barking]

02:18.872 --> 02:20.908
Oh, puppies.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.345
Aren't they the cutest things
you've ever seen?

02:24.412 --> 02:27.181
Hey, KC, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

02:27.248 --> 02:28.416
- If you're thinking that

02:28.482 --> 02:29.783
there are too many dogs
in here,

02:29.850 --> 02:31.752
then, yes, I am.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.421
- No, look around.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.690
Everything I need to groom you
is right here.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.893
- You?
You're going to groom me?

02:39.960 --> 02:42.696
- Yes.
I mean, how hard could it be?

02:42.763 --> 02:44.532
- Oh-ho.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.736
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
I...

02:48.802 --> 02:50.904
You've already groomed KC?

02:50.971 --> 02:52.906
Wow, awesome job.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.242
Thanks, Lacey.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.844
- Turns out grooming
is easy-peasy.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.178
- Easy-peasy.

02:58.246 --> 03:01.249
- Sunny, we need you back
in the salon.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.784
June can't decide between
an up-do or a down-do;

03:03.851 --> 03:06.119
Bridget's thinking about
rainbow highlights;

03:06.186 --> 03:08.188
and nobody can find
the strawberry shampoo

03:08.256 --> 03:09.690
we promised Madison.

03:09.757 --> 03:12.460
- But I haven't groomed
Scratch's Maltese puppies yet.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.095
Oh, if only we had another
pair of hands.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.430
- I've got a pair of hands.

03:16.497 --> 03:20.601
- I just never expected
six Maltese puppies.

03:20.668 --> 03:23.571
- I was just telling KC
how adorable they are.

03:23.637 --> 03:24.772
Wasn't I, KC?

03:24.838 --> 03:26.574
- Yeah, adorable.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.576
- On days like this,
the pet parlor

03:28.642 --> 03:30.911
could really use its own staff.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.080
Someone who understands pets.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.082
- Me, I understand pets.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.584
- And who's an expert groomer.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.086
- Me, me, me.
I'm your gal.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.087
- Oh.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.355
- You said it yourself,

03:41.422 --> 03:44.258
I did an awesome job
grooming KC.

03:44.325 --> 03:47.995
- [giggles]
She does look great.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.931
- Please, Sunny.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.267
- Hmm, okay.
Let's give it a try.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.569
- [gasps]
Did you hear that, KC?

03:55.636 --> 03:59.039
I'm the new pet parlor manager.
[sighs]

03:59.106 --> 04:00.308
- [gasps]

04:00.374 --> 04:02.776
That makes me
assistant manager.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.579
- Let's get through today
first.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.749
If you're gonna work here,
you'll need these.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.752
- Wow.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.153
Thanks, Sunny.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.155
- It's so me.

04:15.222 --> 04:17.691
Okay, bye, Sunny.
- Bye, Blair.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.760
Thank you.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.129
It's about time someone
recognized I was born

04:22.195 --> 04:23.564
to run a pet parlor.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.367
- And I was born to help you
run a pet parlor.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.802
- Okay, KC, no mistakes today.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.338
We need to impress.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.639
Pass me shampoo.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.374
- On it.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.378
Oh, no.
No.

04:37.445 --> 04:40.648
- Ugh, really, KC?

04:42.850 --> 04:43.851
- Here ya go.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.285
- [gasps]
Thanks, Sunny.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.287
I love it.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.989
See you soon.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.958
- Bye, June.
Have a sunny day.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.327
- Bye, see ya later.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.162
[whooshing]

04:55.228 --> 04:56.797
- Hi, everyone.
- [barks]

04:56.864 --> 04:58.766
- Ooh, attention, people.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.234
We have ballerinas
in our salon.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.772
You two in your tutus
are too, too much.

05:04.838 --> 05:05.673
Whoo-hoo.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.274
- [giggles]
- [barks]

05:07.341 --> 05:08.976
- Hi, Hannah.
What can we do for you today?

05:09.042 --> 05:12.413
- Tutu and I need extra special
matching ballet buns

05:12.480 --> 05:13.514
for today's show.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.416
We're dancing "Duck Pond."

05:15.483 --> 05:17.150
- [barks]
Something in pink.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.151
I am pink.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.587
- We can do pink.

05:19.653 --> 05:23.256
There's baby pink, rose pink,
hot pink...

05:23.323 --> 05:25.393
Oh, what about blush pink?

05:25.459 --> 05:27.728
- And how 'bout blush pink
ribbons?

05:27.795 --> 05:29.763
- [barking]

05:29.830 --> 05:31.198
- [giggling]

05:31.264 --> 05:33.166
I think that's a yes.

05:33.233 --> 05:34.902
[giggling]

05:37.004 --> 05:39.573
- Six is a lot of dogs, Lacey.

05:39.640 --> 05:43.110
As assistant manager,
I draw the line at five.

05:43.176 --> 05:47.180
- I need an assistant manager
who can handle six dogs.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.383
- Okay, six works for me.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.419
- Let's start the Groom-O-Max.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.787
Ready?

05:54.988 --> 05:56.256
- Ready.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.859
- Three...two...one...go.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.293
- [squeaks]

06:01.595 --> 06:05.032
- At this rate, we'll never get
six dogs groomed.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.133
- [squeaks]

06:06.199 --> 06:07.401
- Hmm.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.503
I have to make this thing
go faster.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.539
I've got it--wrench.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.508
- One wrench coming up.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.578
- You need a little twist here

06:17.645 --> 06:20.247
and a little tweak there.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.983
And...

06:23.050 --> 06:26.019
[upbeat music]

06:26.086 --> 06:28.456
More speed.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.458
* *

06:30.524 --> 06:32.693
- Hoo-yeah.
- Awesome.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.463
- [barking]

06:36.363 --> 06:38.432
- Lacey.
- Ah.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.701
- Think you can handle
one more customer?

06:40.768 --> 06:42.770
This is Tutu
and she wants a bun

06:42.836 --> 06:44.872
with blush pink streaks
and ribbons.

06:44.938 --> 06:48.408
- Seven dogs?
Unacceptable.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.277
- No job is too big for us.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.845
We're on it.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.013
- Oh.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.047
- Thanks.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.382
Tutu needs to be ready in time

06:55.449 --> 06:57.150
for her big show with Hannah.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.487
But I know you've got it
under control.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.855
You're doing a great job.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.056
- Did you hear that?

07:03.123 --> 07:04.892
We're doing a great job.

07:04.958 --> 07:05.893
- Of course we are.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.295
This grooming is
a piece of cake.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.030
Hmm, you know what?

07:10.097 --> 07:13.400
I know how we can get done
even faster.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.370
I have the need for speed.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.840
I'll wash, you brush.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.643
- On it.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.778
- Come on, pups.
One at a time.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.379
[barking]

07:26.446 --> 07:28.315
[squeaking]

07:28.381 --> 07:29.783
Hmm.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.552
Here you go.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.153
Oh.
- [squeaks]

07:33.220 --> 07:36.156
[barking]

07:36.223 --> 07:38.492
- Ooh.
Ah.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.260
Slow down--ah.

07:40.327 --> 07:41.261
Ooh.

07:41.328 --> 07:44.197
[barking]

07:44.264 --> 07:46.600
- Uh, wait.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.636
That's one dog,
two dogs, three...

07:48.702 --> 07:50.871
- Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.305
- So many dogs.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.473
- Sorry.
- Ah.

07:53.541 --> 07:56.076
- Ah.
- Too fast.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.045
- No such thing as "too fast."

07:58.111 --> 07:59.513
[squeaking]

07:59.580 --> 08:01.148
- This looks like it's gonna
take a while.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.415
Come get me when it's my turn.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.917
Ooh.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.919
[cooing]

08:07.721 --> 08:10.390
[bright tune]

08:10.457 --> 08:12.660
- * If your dog needs
cleaning up *

08:12.726 --> 08:14.962
* Count on us to groom
your pup *

08:15.028 --> 08:16.296
- Whoa.

08:16.363 --> 08:17.364
- [gasps]

08:17.430 --> 08:19.600
- Oh, boy, this isn't good.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.202
- Come on, we gotta get
this place cleaned up

08:22.269 --> 08:24.104
before Sunny comes back.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.506
- [grunting]

08:26.574 --> 08:29.810
- [squeaking]

08:30.778 --> 08:31.912
- Oh.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.381
- [squeaking]

08:34.447 --> 08:36.717
- Hoo.

08:37.885 --> 08:38.652
- Done.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.622
[upbeat music]

08:41.689 --> 08:43.624
- That should do it.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.158
- I'll take out the laundry.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.595
[huffing]

08:48.662 --> 08:49.863
- How's everything going?

08:49.930 --> 08:50.864
- Great.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.400
Better than great.
So great.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.168
- How's Tutu doing?

08:55.235 --> 08:57.137
- Tutu?

08:57.204 --> 09:01.074
Oh, Tutu...uh, fine.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.343
Um...buh-bye.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.378
[playful music]

09:05.445 --> 09:07.180
- [yawns]

09:07.247 --> 09:10.618
- Lacey, we forgot about Tutu.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.119
- Okay, not a problem.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.254
We'll just get her onto
the Groom-O-Max and--

09:14.321 --> 09:15.923
[gasps]

09:15.989 --> 09:17.257
Where is Tutu?

09:17.324 --> 09:18.692
[dramatic music]

09:18.759 --> 09:20.794
together:
Ah!

09:23.196 --> 09:25.098
- Tutu's gone.
W--what do we do?

09:25.165 --> 09:26.366
- She couldn't have gotten far.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.435
We just need to look
everywhere.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.437
- I'll ask Sunny
if she's seen her.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.272
- [gasps]
No.

09:32.339 --> 09:33.741
Sunny won't let me
run this place

09:33.807 --> 09:35.909
if she's looking for the dog
you lost.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.177
- I lost?

09:37.244 --> 09:40.113
- I forgive you.
Now, let's find Tutu, fast.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.083
[bright music]

09:45.653 --> 09:47.955
- Uh, hi there.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.123
- Uh, don't mind us.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.425
* *

09:52.492 --> 09:53.761
Hey, Blair.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.028
- Hi, Lacey.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.731
So, Blair...

09:58.999 --> 10:01.434
Okay, see you later.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.470
* *

10:03.536 --> 10:04.872
- Hi, Lacey.
- [gasps]

10:04.938 --> 10:08.275
Oh, lovely day, isn't it?
[laughs nervously]

10:08.341 --> 10:09.442
- Yeah, it is.
- Uh-huh.

10:09.509 --> 10:10.543
- Yeah, it is.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.814
* *

10:13.881 --> 10:15.282
- Hey, Lacey.
- Ah.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.349
- Looking for something?

10:16.416 --> 10:17.617
- Um...ribbon.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.853
I need pink ribbons
for Tutu's hair.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.522
- Hey, Rosie, Violet,
can you show Lacey

10:22.589 --> 10:24.291
where the pink ribbon is?

10:24.357 --> 10:26.493
together:
This way.

10:26.559 --> 10:30.097
- Here, Tutu.
Here, Tutu.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.365
Tutu, Tutu.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.533
[rumbling]

10:33.600 --> 10:36.303
Tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu--

10:36.369 --> 10:38.638
whoa--it's just you, Lacey.

10:38.706 --> 10:41.041
Tutu is one lost dog.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.810
- Almost done, Hannah.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.779
- And then it's off
to the show.

10:45.846 --> 10:46.847
- Ooh.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.349
Okay, if we can't find
the real Tutu,

10:49.416 --> 10:51.518
maybe we can make a new Tutu.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.086
Come on, KC.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.623
I've got a plan.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.192
All we have to do is color
one of these dogs

10:59.259 --> 11:01.762
with brown hair chalk
to make it look like Tutu.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.064
Then add some pink streaks
and ribbon.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.498
- I don't know, Lacey.

11:05.565 --> 11:08.001
Maybe we should just tell Sunny
that Tutu's gone.

11:08.068 --> 11:11.638
- Then Sunny will never let me
run the pet parlor.

11:11.705 --> 11:15.175
All I ever wanted
was to manage a pet parlor.

11:15.242 --> 11:18.779
Think of all those pets
desperate for Lacey...

11:18.846 --> 11:21.882
- [clears throat]
- And KC to groom them.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.650
[sobbing]

11:23.717 --> 11:26.053
- It'll be okay, Lacey.
Don't cry.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.420
We can do your plan.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.822
- Thanks, I knew you'd see it
my way.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.691
Now, let's make a new Tutu.
[laughs]

11:33.093 --> 11:34.461
- Thanks, I love it.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.730
I just can't wait to see Tutu.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.098
Think she's ready?

11:38.165 --> 11:39.366
- Why don't we check?

11:39.432 --> 11:41.268
- Careful not to miss
any spots.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.536
Now, where's the ballet dress?

11:45.272 --> 11:46.373
- Hi, Lacey.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.374
[gasping]

11:47.440 --> 11:48.608
How's everything going?

11:48.675 --> 11:50.577
- Hi, Sunny.
Everything's fine.

11:50.643 --> 11:51.745
- Yeah, everything's fine.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.814
- Really fine.
- Yeah.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.149
- Is Tutu ready?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.417
- About that...

11:57.484 --> 11:59.419
- Of course Tutu's ready?

11:59.486 --> 12:00.687
- [gasps]
- [barks]

12:00.754 --> 12:02.489
- She looks fantastic.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.457
Thanks, Lacey.
Thanks, KC.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.526
Come on, Tutu,
we have to hurry.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.762
I have just enough time
to put you in the harness

12:08.829 --> 12:10.597
before the show starts.

12:10.663 --> 12:11.965
- Great job, you two.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.234
Maybe you could run
the pet parlor.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.770
- Hey, Lacey.
Hey, KC.

12:16.837 --> 12:20.273
- I just saw Tutu,
she looks awesome.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.674
- Aw, the perfect look

12:21.741 --> 12:24.644
for the world's only
ballet-dancing dog.

12:24.711 --> 12:28.515
- Huh?
"Only ballet-dancing dog?"

12:28.581 --> 12:30.650
- Yep, she's the only dog

12:30.717 --> 12:32.953
to ever perform
the "Duck Pond" Ballet.

12:33.020 --> 12:36.589
And I hear it's incredible,
especially the finale.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.325
- It is, I've seen it.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.994
In the final minutes,
Tutu's in a harness,

12:41.061 --> 12:44.297
and she swings in the air
from side to side,

12:44.364 --> 12:46.466
like she's flying.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.700
- [giggles]

12:47.767 --> 12:49.837
There's just no other dog
like Tutu.

12:49.903 --> 12:50.971
[giggles]

12:51.038 --> 12:54.307
- Well, this is new
information.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.309
Um, okay, lots to do.
Bye.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.046
- This is bad.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.648
- As soon as new Tutu starts
flying across that stage,

13:01.714 --> 13:03.984
everyone will know
we swapped dogs.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.987
We need to find the real Tutu
and swap them back.

13:07.054 --> 13:08.388
Let's go.

13:09.222 --> 13:12.359
Things to do, errands to run.
Bye.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.295
- [squeaks]
Who turned out the lights?

13:15.362 --> 13:17.998
- Ah.
What was that?

13:18.866 --> 13:21.168
- Huh?
Tutu?

13:21.234 --> 13:22.435
- [cooing]

13:22.502 --> 13:24.104
- Where'd your pink bun go?

13:24.171 --> 13:26.439
- And what are you doing
in the laundry basket?

13:26.506 --> 13:28.641
- Uh, taking a nap.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.711
- It looks like she's been here
the whole time.

13:31.778 --> 13:35.215
But if Tutu's here,
then what dog did Hannah take?

13:35.282 --> 13:37.084
- I think I know.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.854
Scratch gave us six puppies,
but now there are only five.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.756
Lacey must have given
one of the puppies to Hannah.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.158
- Um, but she couldn't have.

13:45.225 --> 13:48.061
The puppies are white
and Tutu is brown.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.529
- [gasps]

13:49.596 --> 13:51.965
Lacey must have used
hair chalks to color the puppy.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.401
Okay Tutu, we better get you
to Hannah

13:54.467 --> 13:55.568
before the ballet starts.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.337
- Oh, but she won't be groomed.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.371
- Or styled.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.539
- We'll never make it.

13:59.606 --> 14:00.807
- Never say never.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.842
We can get you ready
in the Glam Van.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.878
It's time for some
glam on the go.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.914
Rosie and Violet,
can you look after

14:06.980 --> 14:08.248
Scratch's other puppies?

14:08.315 --> 14:09.649
- Puppy-sit, hooray.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.651
- Ooh, ooh, we help.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.954
- Then let's do this.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.656
Ready, set...

14:16.723 --> 14:18.425
all:
Gear up and go.

14:18.491 --> 14:21.428
[upbeat music]

14:21.494 --> 14:28.735
* *

14:33.573 --> 14:37.744
- A little from this side,
a little from that side,

14:37.810 --> 14:39.646
a twist...there.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.048
Rox, you're up.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.816
- Some color here and here...

14:43.883 --> 14:45.518
- Don't forget the ribbon.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.654
- Blush pink ribbon coming up.

14:48.888 --> 14:49.923
- Do you like it, Tutu?

14:49.990 --> 14:51.992
- [barks]
Yes, indeed.

14:52.059 --> 14:55.328
- [giggles]
That's one for the Style Files.

14:56.763 --> 14:57.931
Perfect.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.532
Now, we've got a ballet
to get to.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.469
"Duck Pond," here we come.

15:02.535 --> 15:05.538
[bright music]

15:06.339 --> 15:08.275
- [squeaks]
Bring on the ballet.

15:08.341 --> 15:11.578
I need to find Hannah
and get into my harness.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.913
Where is Hannah?

15:13.981 --> 15:17.484
- Hannah's a little busy
right now.

15:17.550 --> 15:20.153
* *

15:22.722 --> 15:24.257
- The show's already begun.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.459
- Begun?
Impossible.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.528
There's no ballet without
my finale.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.663
Who's gonna fly across
the stage?

15:30.730 --> 15:32.532
- [barking]
[all gasping]

15:32.599 --> 15:34.234
- Oh, no.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.603
- Scratch's Maltese.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.106
- Hannah.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.240
- Stop the show.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.976
- It's no use, Hannah can't
hear us.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.846
- I have an idea.

15:46.913 --> 15:50.250
Tutu, you stay here.
The rest of you, follow me.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.521
[gentle instrumental music]

15:54.587 --> 15:56.556
- [laughs]
Look at the ducks.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.392
- Psst...Hannah.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.460
It's us.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.163
- La la la and leap.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.497
- Whoa.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.166
- Uh-oh.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.567
[audience gasping]

16:07.634 --> 16:09.002
Follow my lead.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.504
[cheering]

16:11.571 --> 16:15.275
* *

16:15.342 --> 16:16.609
[applause]

16:16.676 --> 16:19.379
- Hannah, you need to stop
the show.

16:19.446 --> 16:22.815
* *

16:22.882 --> 16:24.317
- Well, that didn't work.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.619
* *

16:26.686 --> 16:28.021
- [panting]

16:28.088 --> 16:30.290
How could the real Tutu
just disappear?

16:30.357 --> 16:31.924
We've looked everywhere.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.227
- Uh, Lacey, up there.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.363
- [panting]

16:36.429 --> 16:37.497
- Come on.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.199
- [barking]

16:40.333 --> 16:41.568
- What are we gonna do?

16:41.634 --> 16:43.870
- Lacey, KC.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.739
- The dog in the harness,
is it Tutu?

16:46.806 --> 16:48.908
- Nope, that would be me.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.711
- Then that means
the dog up there is...

16:51.778 --> 16:54.314
all:
Scratch's Maltese.

16:54.381 --> 16:58.085
- Oh, Sunny, I'm so sorry.

16:58.151 --> 17:02.089
I was trying so hard to be
a good pet parlor manager.

17:02.155 --> 17:06.826
And then we accidentally lost
Tutu, so we made a new Tutu

17:06.893 --> 17:09.962
by coloring the Maltese brown.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.600
And now that poor dog
is up there

17:13.666 --> 17:16.603
hanging in a harness.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.571
[sobbing]

17:18.638 --> 17:20.440
- We can fix this.
- We can?

17:20.507 --> 17:25.478
- Yeah, we just have to get
that dog down and real Tutu up.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.348
[applause]

17:28.415 --> 17:31.484
- Okay, Tutu, time to fly.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.585
- [panting]

17:32.652 --> 17:34.354
[barks]

17:34.421 --> 17:35.922
- Tutu?

17:35.988 --> 17:37.557
together:
I've got this.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.860
[grunting]

17:44.431 --> 17:46.566
[creaking]

17:46.633 --> 17:47.734
- Huh?

17:47.800 --> 17:49.969
[giggles nervously]

17:50.036 --> 17:52.505
Sunny, what's going on?

17:52.572 --> 17:53.773
Tutu?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.074
- That's me.

17:55.142 --> 17:58.145
- But if you're down here,
who's up there?

17:58.211 --> 17:59.279
[clangs]

17:59.346 --> 18:01.448
- Uh-oh.
- Now look what you've done.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.984
- I'm really sorry, Hannah.
This is all my fault.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.919
It was so busy at the salon
and--

18:06.986 --> 18:09.356
- No, it was my fault.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.324
I'm the one who lost Tutu,

18:11.391 --> 18:15.262
then created this mess
when I swapped the dogs.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.630
I'm so sorry.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.499
- So, what do we do now?

18:19.566 --> 18:21.067
- [gasps]
I've got it.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.936
But we're all going to have
to work together.

18:24.003 --> 18:27.340
- I wanna help, please.

18:27.407 --> 18:30.543
- I wanna help, too.
Pretty please.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.645
- Let's do this together.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.748
You go back on stage.
You've got a ballet to finish.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.617
- I'm on it.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.819
- We've got a harness to build.

18:39.886 --> 18:40.887
[cheering]

18:40.953 --> 18:42.289
- * Are we gonna do it? *

18:42.355 --> 18:43.623
all: * Yeah, we're gonna
do it *

18:43.690 --> 18:44.691
* Hey, hey,
whoo *

18:44.757 --> 18:46.125
- * We can do this *

18:46.193 --> 18:47.527
* This thing that
we're trying to do *

18:47.594 --> 18:49.629
- * Though it's hard
just watch *

18:49.696 --> 18:51.231
* As we see it through *

18:51.298 --> 18:54.834
- * Yes, the obstacles,
the obstacles are many *

18:54.901 --> 18:56.869
- * But if we give it all
we've got *

18:56.936 --> 18:59.071
* Pretty soon there won't
be any *

18:59.138 --> 19:00.707
* There's a problem to fix *

19:00.773 --> 19:02.575
* And we're on the case *

19:02.642 --> 19:06.112
* Yes, we'll do the job
with style and with grace *

19:06.179 --> 19:07.414
* And whoops *

19:07.480 --> 19:08.815
- Hmm.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.217
- Never gonna work.
- Never gonna work.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.984
- It's way too hard.
- It's never gonna work.

19:12.051 --> 19:13.453
both: * If you think that you
can fix this *

19:13.520 --> 19:15.555
* You are living
in a fairy tale *

19:15.622 --> 19:17.424
* 'Cause if at first
you don't succeed *

19:17.490 --> 19:18.991
* You're probably
gonna fail *

19:19.058 --> 19:20.460
- * We can do this *

19:20.527 --> 19:22.429
* This thing that we're
trying to do *

19:22.495 --> 19:24.030
- * Never gonna work *
- * No way, no how *

19:24.096 --> 19:26.165
- * Just watch as we
see it through *

19:26.233 --> 19:27.800
- * Never gonna work *
- * Just give up now *

19:27.867 --> 19:30.270
- * The obstacles are many *
- * Too many *

19:30.337 --> 19:31.838
- * But if we give it all
we've got *

19:31.904 --> 19:34.207
* Pretty soon there won't
be any *

19:34.274 --> 19:35.742
* We'll find a fix *

19:35.808 --> 19:37.277
* Yes, we're on the case *

19:37.344 --> 19:39.546
- * It's just too hard,
you'll fail *

19:39.612 --> 19:41.047
- Whoo!
- * We'll cover every base *

19:41.113 --> 19:42.449
- * No way *

19:42.515 --> 19:44.083
- * We're gonna make
this happen *

19:44.150 --> 19:45.485
* And how *
- * Really, how? *

19:45.552 --> 19:47.086
- * Oh, yeah
we're almost there *

19:47.153 --> 19:48.555
- * Nope *
- * Almost there *

19:48.621 --> 19:49.922
- * Nope *
- * Yes, hey, hey *

19:49.989 --> 19:51.458
* Look at us now *

19:51.524 --> 19:52.492
- I knew it would work.

19:52.559 --> 19:55.495
[cheers and applause]

19:55.562 --> 19:57.364
[bright tune]

19:57.430 --> 19:59.399
- That was a great show,
Hannah.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.000
[barking]

20:01.067 --> 20:03.102
And you were both amazing.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.804
- Thanks for all your help.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.240
- Well, now that that's over,

20:07.307 --> 20:11.544
KC and I will just quietly
leave and never come back.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.114
Have I mentioned I'm sorry?

20:15.181 --> 20:17.517
- It's all okay, Lacey.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.419
The audience loved it.

20:19.486 --> 20:22.689
Turns out the finale works
even better as a duet.

20:22.755 --> 20:23.823
- [sneezes]

20:23.890 --> 20:26.192
[gigging]

20:26.259 --> 20:30.029
- So I guess me and KC
running the pet parlor

20:30.096 --> 20:31.631
isn't gonna happen?

20:31.698 --> 20:33.600
- Gee, I don't know.

20:33.666 --> 20:37.437
Where else would we find
managers who love pets,

20:37.504 --> 20:39.205
are expert groomers,

20:39.272 --> 20:42.609
and who never give up till
they get the job done?

20:42.675 --> 20:46.446
- Boss, I think she's talking
about us.

20:46.513 --> 20:47.447
- Really?

20:47.514 --> 20:48.881
- Whoo-hoo.
- Whoo-hoo.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.451
- A-ha.
There's my missing puppy.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.386
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.389
Time to find you
a forever home.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.690
[barking]

20:57.757 --> 21:00.226
- Looks like this pup is home.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.529
Tutu's made a friend.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.963
[squeaking]

21:04.030 --> 21:06.733
- And a dance partner.
[giggles]

21:06.799 --> 21:08.000
- What do you say, Scratch?

21:08.067 --> 21:10.470
- Can she stay with
Hannah and Tutu?

21:10.537 --> 21:12.071
- Pretty please.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.874
- Uh...sure.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.776
[barking]

21:16.843 --> 21:19.646
- Welcome to your forever home.

21:19.712 --> 21:20.913
[giggling]

21:20.980 --> 21:22.482
- And if I hadn't mixed up
the dogs,

21:22.549 --> 21:24.651
the ballet wouldn't have been
such a big success,

21:24.717 --> 21:27.754
and this little dog wouldn't
have found a forever home.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.289
[giggles]
You're welcome.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.661
I'm kidding.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.964
[laughter]

21:42.602 --> 21:43.803
- Hi, it's me, Sunny.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.772
Wanna take a look inside
the Style Files?

21:45.838 --> 21:47.440
Wow.

21:47.507 --> 21:50.142
That's the sparkliest
dance bun I've ever seen.

21:50.209 --> 21:51.911
For this hairstyle
and more,

21:51.978 --> 21:53.813
check out the Nick Jr. app.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.816
[exciting music]

21:56.883 --> 21:59.218
Keep smiling, keep styling.

21:59.285 --> 22:00.420
