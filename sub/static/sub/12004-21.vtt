WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:01.599
Previously on "Switched at birth..."

00:01.690 --> 00:04.027
When it comes to the music stuff,
I want you to stay out of it.

00:04.027 --> 00:06.253
Any chance you want to
come down to Springfield?

00:06.254 --> 00:08.036
I have a physics test on Friday.

00:11.045 --> 00:13.192
I knew that you...

00:14.572 --> 00:15.603
and Bay

00:17.938 --> 00:19.047
were switched.

00:19.370 --> 00:22.168
Sarah is writing a book about the switch.

00:22.169 --> 00:24.475
- Why did you lie about meeting with her?
- Oh no.

00:24.476 --> 00:26.593
This is not what you think it is.

00:26.700 --> 00:29.365
- We know there's another book being written.
- Sarah Lazar.

00:29.366 --> 00:31.380
Unless you get Regina on board,

00:31.381 --> 00:33.065
I'm afraid it's too much of a risk.

00:33.066 --> 00:36.645
I think Emmett might be
in trouble. Can we talk?

00:36.805 --> 00:38.921
_

00:39.308 --> 00:40.632
I know. I'm sorry.

00:40.687 --> 00:42.012
_

00:42.249 --> 00:43.179
Damn it.

00:45.885 --> 00:46.967
I could help.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.413 --> 00:59.144
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:59.879 --> 01:02.530
You got away last night
before I could talk to you.

01:02.828 --> 01:05.388
I'm a sore loser, uh,

01:05.390 --> 01:08.637
- but you played a great game.
- Thanks.

01:09.558 --> 01:12.945
I'm sorry I accused you of trying
to get me booted off the team.

01:12.946 --> 01:14.697
I shouldn't have assumed it was you.

01:17.777 --> 01:20.115
Do you want to join me for breakfast?

01:20.442 --> 01:22.852
Oh, um... Yeah. Yeah sure.

01:22.853 --> 01:25.568
I would love to, but my shower is running.

01:25.569 --> 01:27.911
- Can I meet you in 20 minutes?
- No problem.

01:27.912 --> 01:29.371
I'll see you downstairs.

01:33.324 --> 01:33.882
She didn't see you.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.234
_

01:36.338 --> 01:39.213
I don't understand what
you're saying but you should go.

01:40.088 --> 01:41.525
Like now.

01:42.398 --> 01:44.332
Wait, let me make sure she's gone.

02:20.835 --> 02:22.079
Not sure you should have writer's block

02:22.080 --> 02:23.858
when you've actually lived the story.

02:24.612 --> 02:27.264
No, I'm debating whether
to open up this file

02:27.265 --> 02:28.919
that my editor sent me.

02:29.240 --> 02:32.139
- What's in it?
- Uh, the first chapter

02:32.140 --> 02:34.717
of a competing book about the switch.

02:35.632 --> 02:36.778
It's out already?

02:36.779 --> 02:38.757
No, it's a manuscript. I'm not sure

02:38.821 --> 02:41.317
how she got her hands on it,
but she wants me to take a look at it

02:41.444 --> 02:45.105
- and see what I'm up against.
- I wouldn't do that.

02:45.106 --> 02:47.085
You're just gonna psych yourself out.

02:47.821 --> 02:50.807
Just delete the file,
focus on your own book.

02:54.630 --> 02:55.631
Mom.

03:21.642 --> 03:22.586
Hi.

03:25.936 --> 03:28.151
I tried texting you last night.

03:28.151 --> 03:29.094
You never responded.

03:29.193 --> 03:31.273
_

03:32.833 --> 03:34.708
_

03:34.929 --> 03:38.684
I don't understand. Last time we talked

03:38.685 --> 03:40.891
you were yelling at me.

03:42.657 --> 03:45.152
I thought your head was gonna explode.

03:45.213 --> 03:46.543
_

03:46.764 --> 03:47.765
_

03:52.525 --> 03:54.558
_

03:58.081 --> 04:01.408
_

04:02.029 --> 04:03.755
_

04:04.263 --> 04:05.567
_

04:11.755 --> 04:13.434
What did you say to him?

04:14.106 --> 04:15.688
Nothing, why?

04:15.802 --> 04:18.170
He freaked out at me on the phone

04:18.171 --> 04:19.548
and then he just shows up.

04:19.548 --> 04:22.560
And he acts like everything is fine.

04:22.561 --> 04:24.102
It's like Jekyll and Hyde.

04:24.732 --> 04:28.007
We didn't talk about you out there, I swear.

04:28.530 --> 04:29.952
I wonder what happened.

04:29.953 --> 04:32.145
Does it matter? Just go with it.

04:32.201 --> 04:34.045
Look... for Emmett's birthday.

04:34.384 --> 04:37.568
He doesn't have this poster.
It's in italian.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.069
I think I can get it for like 30 bucks.

04:40.070 --> 04:42.411
"Deafenstein" again? Seriously?

04:43.682 --> 04:45.925
There's only been like five

04:46.162 --> 04:49.015
A.S.L. horror movies in the past 50 years.

04:49.170 --> 04:50.998
It's kinda special to us deafies.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.366
You need more A.S.L. movies.

04:53.435 --> 04:56.440
I know. Actually, Emmett and I...

04:57.210 --> 04:59.090
Well, we had this idea

04:59.091 --> 05:02.960
for a zombie movie and it was called
"Dawn of the deaf."

05:03.007 --> 05:06.816
- We even wrote a script.
- Why don't we do it now?

05:07.779 --> 05:09.430
For Emmett's birthday?

05:11.637 --> 05:12.691
I don't know.

05:13.161 --> 05:14.414
We wanted it to be good,

05:14.415 --> 05:16.380
like with special effects

05:16.381 --> 05:18.809
and zombies that aren't cheesy.

05:19.060 --> 05:23.248
Are you kidding? J & K live
for projects like this.

05:23.249 --> 05:24.880
They'll be off and running with it.

05:26.907 --> 05:30.122
I never thought it could actually happen.

05:31.004 --> 05:32.801
Regina, could you just let me finish.

05:33.078 --> 05:35.140
Is there anything different
than the last time you asked

05:35.141 --> 05:36.978
for my cooperation with your book?

05:37.114 --> 05:38.782
Then the answer is no.

05:39.311 --> 05:40.914
You're being unreasonable.

05:40.915 --> 05:43.666
- Wait wait, different how?
- Oh, I don't know,

05:43.667 --> 05:46.371
like "I've just been diagnosed
with a life-theatening illness"

05:46.372 --> 05:48.833
"and I want this book to
be my life's last work."

05:49.532 --> 05:51.588
The editor said the book
would be an easier sell

05:51.589 --> 05:53.294
if I included your side of the story,

05:53.295 --> 05:55.071
which I figure benefits you.

05:55.072 --> 05:59.009
- I'm not interested.
- I'm just asking you for a favor.

05:59.010 --> 06:01.308
You want to publish
intimate details about my life

06:01.309 --> 06:02.946
and rehash the choices I've made.

06:02.947 --> 06:05.429
No, you'd be telling your side, not me.

06:05.555 --> 06:08.580
Kathryn, the answer is no.

06:08.581 --> 06:12.596
Ask me tomorrow, ask me next year:
the answer is no.

06:15.643 --> 06:18.582
So since it's mostly a silent film,

06:18.644 --> 06:21.781
we could do something classic
like creepy organ

06:21.898 --> 06:25.222
or something more contemporary suspense,

06:25.223 --> 06:28.097
like some dissonant strings or something.

06:28.445 --> 06:30.188
It's all the same to me,

06:30.420 --> 06:32.172
so I'm gonna have to count on you.

06:32.173 --> 06:34.200
- Just make it good.
- Done.

06:37.489 --> 06:39.170
So I heard Simone

06:39.648 --> 06:42.393
tried to get you disqualified
from the tournament.

06:42.816 --> 06:45.554
Actually it wasn't Simone.
I just thought it was her.

06:47.057 --> 06:48.782
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

06:49.928 --> 06:51.906
Hey! So Emmett...

06:51.907 --> 06:53.938
- totally on board.
- Sweet!

06:53.939 --> 06:56.843
Toby's gonna get some extras from Buckner,

06:56.844 --> 07:00.633
Wilke's going to play a guard
and John got all these costumes

07:00.634 --> 07:02.806
and you're not listening.

07:03.197 --> 07:04.129
Oh.

07:04.331 --> 07:07.638
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Your movie sounds great.

07:08.457 --> 07:09.509
You're making a movie?

07:09.510 --> 07:12.864
Yeah, it's zombie movie
for Emmett's birthday.

07:12.865 --> 07:16.131
- Oh.
- You know Danielle from the salon?

07:16.132 --> 07:19.003
She might be able to get us some
stage make-up at a discount.

07:19.004 --> 07:21.954
- Kathryn actually got a make-up artist.
- Oh.

07:22.582 --> 07:23.505
Great.

07:24.222 --> 07:26.884
- Will you do hair?
- Of course.

07:27.384 --> 07:29.421
Who wants to join me for a swim?

07:29.422 --> 07:31.030
I have to work on my script.

07:31.031 --> 07:35.130
I have to call Geraldo about
picking up an extra shift.

07:35.684 --> 07:37.773
You live with this gorgeous pool...

07:37.922 --> 07:40.371
neither of you has ever been in it.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.786
Next time.

08:06.308 --> 08:08.542
_

08:08.973 --> 08:10.046
_

08:13.004 --> 08:14.319
_

08:15.279 --> 08:16.198
_

08:18.334 --> 08:20.727
_

08:21.558 --> 08:22.724
_

08:23.684 --> 08:26.986
_

08:28.064 --> 08:29.800
_

08:29.856 --> 08:31.058
_

08:32.311 --> 08:33.389
_

08:33.486 --> 08:34.893
_

08:35.320 --> 08:38.000
_

08:38.308 --> 08:41.081
_

08:41.738 --> 08:43.638
_

08:45.230 --> 08:47.145
_

08:51.006 --> 08:53.045
_

08:53.435 --> 08:55.612
_

09:48.234 --> 09:50.900
You told Sarah Lazar
about my miscarriage?!

09:50.901 --> 09:52.841
- What?
- It's right there in her book!

09:52.842 --> 09:54.340
Chapter one: "Before the"

09:54.341 --> 09:56.609
"Kennishes lost a daughter
to hospital error,"

09:56.610 --> 09:58.404
"Kathryn lost a child to a miscarriage."

09:58.405 --> 10:00.175
Her book? How the hell
did you read her book?

10:00.176 --> 10:03.777
- That was private.
- Sweetie, look, a lot of couples miscarry.

10:03.778 --> 10:05.896
- This is nothing to be ashamed of.
- That is not the point!

10:05.897 --> 10:08.130
- Then why are you yelling at me?
- All these years

10:08.131 --> 10:11.770
you have told me that all
you talked about was baseball with her.

10:11.771 --> 10:15.060
It was just business.
And now I find out that you shared

10:15.061 --> 10:17.829
one of the most intimate
details of our life together.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.739
- Kathryn, that was so long ago...
- And here we are again.

10:30.128 --> 10:33.983
No, you have to raise
your eyebrows if it's a yes-no question.

10:34.169 --> 10:37.337
- "Are you a student?"
- That looked like "Student, you?"

10:37.587 --> 10:39.144
That's how you say it in A.S.L.

10:39.145 --> 10:41.590
the main topic "Student" comes first.

10:42.036 --> 10:44.214
So it's talking like Yoda?

10:44.747 --> 10:46.897
Exactly. It's try.

10:47.151 --> 10:48.331
"Are you a student?"

10:51.767 --> 10:53.585
Good! Raise your eyebrows.

10:55.249 --> 10:56.583
Can't I just be the slutty blonde

10:56.584 --> 10:57.996
who gets killed in the first scene?

10:57.997 --> 11:00.735
If you want to be in the movie,
you have to know how to sign.

11:00.736 --> 11:03.853
Okay. How about a study break?

11:12.795 --> 11:15.175
You know Toby and I
used to hide out in here

11:15.176 --> 11:17.739
and play cards.
Sometimes Bay would find us

11:17.740 --> 11:19.632
and we'd make her go get us cookies.

11:20.064 --> 11:22.755
- Nice.
- Y'know, if that whole switch thing

11:22.756 --> 11:25.207
hadn't have happened, that would've
been you getting us cookies.

11:27.913 --> 11:28.929
You would have totally had

11:28.930 --> 11:31.018
one of those little-sister crushes on me.

11:31.780 --> 11:32.801
Mm-hmm.

11:33.179 --> 11:34.693
I was pretty cute back then.

11:34.877 --> 11:35.900
Whatever.

11:35.914 --> 11:37.616
Let's go back to the script.

11:39.460 --> 11:41.388
- "I think..."
- I think...

11:41.389 --> 11:43.925
- "that's brain..."
- brains...

11:44.176 --> 11:47.139
"oozing out of his ear."

11:47.627 --> 11:48.749
Good.

11:53.391 --> 11:57.997
_

11:58.300 --> 12:00.441
_

12:01.720 --> 12:03.984
_

12:04.035 --> 12:05.987
_

12:06.069 --> 12:07.388
_

12:07.460 --> 12:10.238
_

12:10.690 --> 12:13.458
_

12:14.957 --> 12:16.225
_

12:16.323 --> 12:17.576
_

12:23.693 --> 12:26.415
Hi. I found some Halloween decorations.

12:26.416 --> 12:28.840
- Oh, that's cool.
- Thanks.

12:28.887 --> 12:29.925
_

12:30.048 --> 12:31.963
Oh, it's an aviary...

12:32.441 --> 12:34.982
a house for birds.

12:35.558 --> 12:36.955
We never used it because Bay

12:36.956 --> 12:39.356
didn't want to put the birds into jail.

12:39.357 --> 12:42.205
So we just use it as a playhouse.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.784
Um oh, you know,
there's more of these over there.

13:04.470 --> 13:07.164
Bay and Toby's handprints
when they were little.

13:12.655 --> 13:14.329
She was five?

13:23.173 --> 13:24.889
I'll talk to John and
I'll get back to you.

13:24.890 --> 13:27.473
- Thanks, Craig.
- Talk to me about what?

13:27.910 --> 13:30.549
Angelo. He left some of his belongings

13:30.550 --> 13:33.259
in a storage locker in
the basement of his apartment building.

13:33.260 --> 13:35.688
Really? What's in there?

13:36.510 --> 13:38.045
They haven't been through it yet.

13:38.236 --> 13:40.270
Craig thinks you or I
should go with the P.I.

13:40.271 --> 13:42.059
since we actually knew Angelo,

13:42.060 --> 13:44.278
we might see something that he'd overlook.

13:44.890 --> 13:47.296
Shouldn't Regina go? I mean,
she was closest to him.

13:47.319 --> 13:50.426
Fine. I'll ask Regina.

13:53.886 --> 13:54.896
Is it an assignment for

13:54.897 --> 13:56.760
a media class or a school-sanctioned club?

13:56.761 --> 13:58.795
No, it's a personal project.

13:58.817 --> 13:59.811
Personal?

14:00.509 --> 14:02.288
I'm making a zombie movie.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.016
How original. Why don't
you add a brooding vampire

14:05.017 --> 14:06.570
and an oversexed werewolf then

14:06.571 --> 14:09.109
you can hit all three
horror cliches at once.

14:09.110 --> 14:10.791
So the equipment?

14:12.764 --> 14:16.049
You are not on the approved
list of equipment borrowers.

14:16.050 --> 14:18.147
You haven't even taken media studies 1.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.902
I know how to work a video camera.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.243
That very comment tells me how

14:22.244 --> 14:24.208
little you can be trusted
with this equipment.

14:24.209 --> 14:27.193
- C'mon, Randall.
- Look, evenf I could bend the rules,

14:27.194 --> 14:29.703
which I can't, the equipment
that you're looking for

14:29.704 --> 14:32.054
- is already checked out.
- By who?

14:44.133 --> 14:46.788
- Hi.
- Can I talk to you?

14:47.848 --> 14:48.869
Sure.

14:49.901 --> 14:50.930
Here?

14:51.925 --> 14:52.855
Yeah.

14:56.936 --> 14:58.808
This is going to sound crazy, I know,

14:58.809 --> 15:03.055
but I went to go check
out some video equipment

15:03.056 --> 15:05.165
and I was told that you had
checked it out already.

15:05.166 --> 15:08.762
And I was wondering if I could
borrow it over the weekend?

15:10.225 --> 15:12.193
I wouldn't normally ask
but I have this project...

15:12.194 --> 15:14.404
It's fine. You can borrow it.

15:14.758 --> 15:16.479
- I... I can?
- Yeah.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.329
I'll give it to Toby and
he'll give it to you. No problem.

15:20.940 --> 15:21.954
Okay.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.122
Thanks.

15:29.908 --> 15:31.016
Uh...

15:32.548 --> 15:34.827
I just also wanted to say I...

15:35.083 --> 15:37.648
I heard what happened at the tournament.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.205
You did.

15:41.647 --> 15:43.489
Okay, um...

15:44.463 --> 15:49.096
- Well, the thing is, uh...
- Well, whatever, right?

15:49.782 --> 15:51.642
I mean, you can't blame yourself.

15:53.832 --> 15:56.079
You guys will win next time.

15:57.549 --> 15:58.688
Go Bulldogs.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.591
Go Bulldogs.

16:17.196 --> 16:18.714
Grandma, that is a good zombie walk.

16:18.715 --> 16:21.995
Ah, slow but unstoppable.

16:22.130 --> 16:23.063
Huh?

16:23.246 --> 16:25.368
If we could just put a little blood

16:25.369 --> 16:27.432
right there, that'd be great.

16:40.350 --> 16:42.550
- That is so cool.
- Awesome.

16:56.446 --> 16:58.865
Wow, that's really something.

16:59.445 --> 17:03.270
- Yeah.
- Um, what's that?

17:03.305 --> 17:04.987
It's a wind machine.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.944
John thought it would be cool
to have for the last shot.

17:07.980 --> 17:09.326
A wind machine?

17:09.663 --> 17:12.018
Can't use actual wind?

17:14.321 --> 17:15.789
I gotta get started.

17:18.819 --> 17:20.251
Okay, hey, everybody,

17:20.252 --> 17:23.154
let's gather up and
discuss the first shot.

17:23.155 --> 17:26.319
Zombies over here and then
everyone else over here.

17:27.097 --> 17:29.993
Okay, zombies coming around the corner,

17:29.994 --> 17:32.488
John and Wilke say their lines.

17:32.489 --> 17:34.857
- Holy mother of god!
- Don't.

17:34.935 --> 17:37.704
You guys will continue towards the camera,

17:37.705 --> 17:41.569
and we'll cut before you eat John.

17:41.823 --> 17:43.319
Okay, let's do this thing.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.291
Roll it!

17:46.360 --> 17:50.359
So, "Dawn of the deaf,"
scene one, take one.

17:52.795 --> 17:55.701
And action!

18:06.587 --> 18:08.113
Uh uh, it's not working.

18:08.114 --> 18:10.253
- Um...
- What's wrong?

18:10.824 --> 18:12.857
I don't know. It just keeps blinking.

18:12.858 --> 18:16.151
Okay, cut cut cut! Everybody take five.

18:16.152 --> 18:18.715
And we'll try to fix this.

18:19.235 --> 18:21.933
I'm gonna kill me some zombies today.

18:23.353 --> 18:26.090
Well, have any onion bagels?

18:30.899 --> 18:34.459
Thank you. Still getting
the silent treatment I see.

18:34.460 --> 18:36.928
The silent treatment?
I just don't have anything to say.

18:36.929 --> 18:38.337
Kathryn, come on.

18:38.848 --> 18:42.000
I did not mean to tell her
about the miscarriage, okay?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.158
Kathryn, all right, it just came out.

18:45.402 --> 18:46.690
Over drinks at her hotel?

18:46.691 --> 18:48.443
In the tunnel on
the way to the clubhouse.

18:48.444 --> 18:51.169
I had just gotten off the pay
phone with you. You were crying.

18:51.170 --> 18:53.394
I felt like a jerk 'cause I wasn't there.

18:53.395 --> 18:55.824
She saw me, she said "Hey,
what's wrong?" I told her.

18:56.491 --> 18:58.686
You just don't tell a casual
acquaintance something that personal.

18:58.687 --> 19:00.005
- She..
- You just don't.

19:00.685 --> 19:03.203
We have been having
to this argument forever.

19:03.204 --> 19:06.097
Nothing happened between
me and Sarah Lazar.

19:06.098 --> 19:07.961
Can we just bury it?

19:14.632 --> 19:16.907
I have to get to that
stage locker with Regina.

19:17.432 --> 19:19.580
- Will you take over the blood?
- Yeah.

19:22.752 --> 19:25.959
- Did you try re-booting it?
- Gee, I didn't think of that.

19:26.213 --> 19:28.279
Of course I re-booted it. It didn't work.

19:29.739 --> 19:31.402
Dude, are you eating the blood?

19:32.314 --> 19:33.555
It tastes like chocolate.

19:35.131 --> 19:37.037
- Why don't you call Simone?
- Mmm.

19:37.038 --> 19:38.330
I'm on probation.

19:38.379 --> 19:39.800
She was pissed that
I didn't go to the tournament.

19:39.801 --> 19:41.016
I don't want to bother her.

19:41.768 --> 19:44.021
I thought you went.
I heard you were there with her.

19:44.022 --> 19:45.371
No, it's kind of a long story.

19:45.372 --> 19:49.670
But you're right... I should call her.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.188
Ah, there you go.

19:59.903 --> 20:02.270
It's always the last one you try.

20:03.421 --> 20:05.545
Anything look interesting,
put it in the box.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.040
Anything you're not sure about,
put it in the box.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.314
I have to make a call.

20:10.952 --> 20:12.752
I don't think he's a morning person.

20:12.992 --> 20:15.853
- That makes two of us.
- Look, I am sorry.

20:15.854 --> 20:17.772
This was the only time he could do this.

20:17.773 --> 20:21.342
And thank you. I know that Angelo
is not your favorite subject.

20:21.606 --> 20:24.435
Yeah, I admit, you know, I'm curious.

20:26.218 --> 20:28.396
What exactly are we looking for?

20:29.382 --> 20:31.437
Anything about the hospital or the switch

20:31.438 --> 20:33.275
or where Angelo might have gone.

20:33.507 --> 20:35.153
Well we know he's not skiing.

20:36.907 --> 20:39.147
Seriously, I never understood
how he ended up in Chicago.

20:39.148 --> 20:41.744
- He hates the cold.
- This is interesting.

20:42.169 --> 20:44.103
- Do you recognize this?
- No.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.209
But then again,
I don't recognize any of this.

20:47.266 --> 20:49.899
I think I have a charger for
this in my junk drawer at home.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.831
I'm going to take it.
Unless of course you want...

20:55.214 --> 20:58.314
- Uh-oh. What is that?
- Maybe he went to see her.

21:00.331 --> 21:03.014
We should probably find out who she is.

21:03.262 --> 21:07.923
You know what? I'll just
deal with this later.

21:11.164 --> 21:13.399
I don't know why I'm so shocked.
It's been 13 years.

21:13.433 --> 21:15.434
Of course he's been with other people.

21:15.469 --> 21:17.536
Yeah, but you don't want to see it.

21:39.190 --> 21:44.049
I never thought that I would say this,
but this is fun.

21:44.049 --> 21:45.498
_

21:45.530 --> 21:49.200
Oh... the grass is wet.
Maybe we should rehearse the next scene.

21:52.470 --> 21:54.222
_

21:57.241 --> 21:58.577
Uh, hey there.

22:01.843 --> 22:03.530
Ha! Hi.

22:03.877 --> 22:06.218
- Hey.
- Thought I would call in the expert

22:06.253 --> 22:07.553
and help us with the camera.

22:07.588 --> 22:10.389
I am sorry that Toby woke you up so early,

22:10.424 --> 22:13.225
- but I'm glad you're here.
- It's not a problem.

22:13.260 --> 22:16.395
Do you know Emmett, my boyfriend?

22:16.429 --> 22:18.597
Emmett, this is Simone. Simone, Emmett.

22:20.977 --> 22:23.101
I think we met at East West, right?

22:26.577 --> 22:29.276
He says it's nice to see you again.

22:30.544 --> 22:31.482
You too.

22:39.188 --> 22:39.786
You know,

22:41.545 --> 22:44.193
a few years ago there were these rumors

22:44.227 --> 22:48.297
about John and this reporter Sarah Lazar.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.466
It didn't really bother me until they...

22:51.601 --> 22:56.138
they ran this picture of them... together.

22:58.793 --> 23:02.242
You know, I actually went
to see a plastic surgeon

23:02.242 --> 23:04.380
because I thought that woutd
give me confidence or something.

23:05.564 --> 23:06.416
It was ridiculous.

23:08.419 --> 23:11.255
I've been the woman trying
to take the guy away.

23:11.289 --> 23:15.193
Trust me... she envied you.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.163
She's writing a book

23:18.197 --> 23:20.132
about the switch.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.100
- You mean us?
- Yeah.

23:22.135 --> 23:24.536
My editor sent me a chapter.

23:25.394 --> 23:27.271
She's writing my story.

23:28.540 --> 23:31.442
I finally understand why
you don't want me to tell yours.

23:32.560 --> 23:36.113
So you're still doing yours?

23:36.564 --> 23:38.415
Yeah.

23:38.852 --> 23:42.108
I have to. It's my life,

23:42.108 --> 23:44.354
and I'm not gonna get
scooped by Sarah Lazar.

23:54.675 --> 23:55.741
Bay.

23:58.446 --> 23:59.501
There you are.

24:01.094 --> 24:03.351
Everyone has been looking for you.

24:04.635 --> 24:05.757
Are you okay?

24:05.757 --> 24:07.489
Let me take a look at that.

24:12.845 --> 24:14.595
And cut!

24:15.610 --> 24:17.004
Oh, mom, seriously,

24:17.004 --> 24:18.632
are you gonna applaud
after every single take?

24:18.667 --> 24:20.634
- You guys are so good.
- Really.

24:20.668 --> 24:22.927
Thanks. I feel like a stiff,

24:22.927 --> 24:25.605
but you are like a total natural.

24:25.639 --> 24:27.740
Yeah, it was super cool. Great job, guys.

24:29.335 --> 24:31.670
_

24:31.746 --> 24:33.781
Um, not too much more though,

24:33.815 --> 24:35.783
'cause otherwise my character

24:35.817 --> 24:38.353
looks dumb for not figuring it out.

24:39.822 --> 24:42.758
- See there, it did it again.
- What's that?

24:42.792 --> 24:45.594
I don't know. Just keeps saying
"Check white balance"

24:45.629 --> 24:46.803
and then it won't record.

24:46.803 --> 24:49.799
Basically it means you gotta
teach the camera what white is.

24:49.833 --> 24:52.164
- How do we do that?
- Teach it to play hacky sack.

24:52.164 --> 24:54.637
- Nice.
- We can try creating a backup file.

24:56.115 --> 24:59.572
Uh, she's saying that
we have a new camera operator.

24:59.572 --> 25:01.597
- That's awesome. Thank you so much.

25:01.597 --> 25:02.608
Ah, here's the foot.

25:02.608 --> 25:05.223
Guys, I could use some help
with the body parts. Thanks.

25:07.434 --> 25:08.535
You're awesome.

25:14.780 --> 25:16.655
I'm trying to. I'm stuck.

25:16.655 --> 25:17.401
_

25:17.401 --> 25:19.413
I don't know what you're saying.

25:19.447 --> 25:20.719
Look, just be cool.

25:21.799 --> 25:23.684
Hey, what's up?

25:23.718 --> 25:26.553
I was just asking some
questions about the script,

25:26.588 --> 25:30.458
- or trying to.
- Yeah, I've been where you are.

25:30.493 --> 25:32.270
Is there anything
you want me to interpret?

25:32.270 --> 25:32.665
_

25:32.665 --> 25:34.142
We don't need to drag you into this.

25:34.142 --> 25:36.699
_

25:36.700 --> 25:37.649
Okay.

25:38.435 --> 25:39.435
Okay.

25:42.573 --> 25:45.509
Mmm, look at that drip.

25:45.937 --> 25:47.544
That's so cool.

25:48.974 --> 25:52.043
The secret ingredient is chocolate sauce.

25:52.132 --> 25:54.587
_

25:55.947 --> 25:58.488
Really? Mmm.

26:02.503 --> 26:05.595
Okay, um, let me check
and I'll call you back.

26:05.930 --> 26:07.330
Okay bye.

26:07.871 --> 26:10.400
That was Geraldo. He's stuck.

26:10.434 --> 26:12.572
One of his hair stylists
for a wedding had to cancel

26:12.572 --> 26:16.440
and he's offering me time
and a half to fill in.

26:16.474 --> 26:18.708
I mean, the hair's basically done here.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.841
And you can do touch-ups, right?

26:20.841 --> 26:21.729
_

26:22.229 --> 26:23.212
I can help.

26:28.486 --> 26:31.621
Do you mind? We could
really use the money.

26:32.086 --> 26:32.915
It's fine.

26:33.582 --> 26:36.345
I'll be back. as soon as I can,

26:36.345 --> 26:38.395
and I'm sure the Kennishes
have got you covered.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.565
- Okay?
- Sure.

26:43.035 --> 26:43.650
Bye.

26:45.261 --> 26:46.198
Bye.

26:55.155 --> 26:58.682
You are a genius! This is perfect, Simone.

26:58.717 --> 27:00.584
Thanks to Mrs. K for the wheels.

27:06.658 --> 27:09.326
Okay, I think I have
the tag line for the poster:

27:09.360 --> 27:12.361
"Dawn of the deaf:
They're silent but deadly."

27:12.909 --> 27:13.990
No.

27:21.270 --> 27:24.472
Hey, so it looks like you've
got a handle on things now,

27:24.507 --> 27:26.574
- and I've got a paper due so...
- What?

27:26.609 --> 27:29.378
No, stay! There's only two more scenes.

27:29.412 --> 27:32.548
Oh my god, you're like
the cutest zombie ever!

27:32.583 --> 27:34.617
Too bad I have to blow your head off.

27:35.753 --> 27:38.721
Okay, you guys are going
to start from out there.

27:39.160 --> 27:42.392
We are going to start on Wilke

27:42.427 --> 27:44.662
and Emmett's going to come up behind him.

27:44.696 --> 27:48.766
Turn away before Emmett has
the chance to bite you.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.867
And then he's gonna cover.

27:50.867 --> 27:51.836
Okay?

27:55.807 --> 27:58.375
- Let's roll it!
- "Dawn of the deaf,"

27:58.409 --> 28:00.310
scene four, take one.

28:01.378 --> 28:02.645
Uh, wait. I don't have a phone.

28:02.679 --> 28:05.414
Uh, here, use this one.

28:05.448 --> 28:07.449
- It really doesn't matter.
- All right.

28:09.619 --> 28:11.654
Okay, let's do it again
from the top.

28:11.688 --> 28:13.756
Scene four, take two.

28:15.759 --> 28:18.261
And, Wilke, start texting.

28:18.295 --> 28:19.596
Action.

28:21.141 --> 28:23.534
Get in closer.

28:23.568 --> 28:26.604
Coming up on Wilke... that's your cue.

28:30.186 --> 28:31.599
Wilke, that's your cue.

28:36.549 --> 28:39.350
Well, cut! Don't look in the camera!

28:42.755 --> 28:44.522
Sorry.

28:44.557 --> 28:47.793
Um, I think I have your phone.

28:49.529 --> 28:51.764
You probably shouldn't
leave it lying around.

28:54.535 --> 28:56.797
All right, let's just try it again.

28:57.651 --> 28:59.705
Back to one.

29:19.541 --> 29:21.245
_

29:21.683 --> 29:23.653
_

29:24.519 --> 29:25.694
_

29:25.694 --> 29:27.770
_

29:28.662 --> 29:29.683
_

29:34.640 --> 29:35.931
_

29:38.077 --> 29:40.320
_

29:40.382 --> 29:43.227
_

29:44.305 --> 29:45.591
_

29:48.750 --> 29:50.391
_

29:50.556 --> 29:52.485
_

30:03.782 --> 30:04.814
_

30:05.371 --> 30:08.456
_

30:11.887 --> 30:15.281
_

30:16.133 --> 30:17.735
_

30:18.700 --> 30:21.047
_

30:23.820 --> 30:25.216
_

30:30.217 --> 30:36.620
_

30:39.085 --> 30:42.597
_

30:44.733 --> 30:47.301
_

30:47.598 --> 30:50.695
_

30:52.487 --> 30:54.510
_

30:55.080 --> 30:56.692
_

30:57.108 --> 30:59.336
_

31:08.585 --> 31:08.585
_

31:08.585 --> 31:09.631
Can you help carry some

31:09.632 --> 31:11.587
of that lighting equipment
out to the pool?

31:11.621 --> 31:14.623
Totally. I was just gonna grab
some zombie fingers first.

31:17.594 --> 31:19.661
You hooked up with Emmett?

31:20.098 --> 31:22.497
What? No.

31:24.571 --> 31:26.768
I heard you had somebody in
your room at the tournament,

31:26.802 --> 31:28.736
which I figured was just a rumor.

31:28.771 --> 31:30.771
And then I read your texts.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.773
Look, it was a complete mistake.

31:33.855 --> 31:36.678
You gotta understand that
I had just lost the game, and

31:37.927 --> 31:40.615
Toby had bailed on me and I was drunk.

31:40.649 --> 31:43.485
- That's your excuse?
- No.

31:44.010 --> 31:46.856
I mean... look, I'm...
I'm trying to explain to you

31:46.890 --> 31:49.626
that it was really messed up,
but I just don't think

31:49.660 --> 31:51.895
that everything should be
blown up out of proportion

31:51.929 --> 31:54.732
over something that happened
once that meant nothing.

31:54.766 --> 31:57.917
Toby is my best friend.
And what about Bay?

31:57.917 --> 32:01.435
Look, if I could go back in
time and undo things, I would.

32:02.808 --> 32:04.604
Please, I am asking you to

32:04.604 --> 32:06.811
just let this one die
for everybody's sake.

32:08.680 --> 32:09.701
Please.

32:11.770 --> 32:15.026
"Dawn of the deaf," scene four, take five.

32:15.026 --> 32:15.852
Marking.

32:19.490 --> 32:20.890
We set? Ready?

32:21.722 --> 32:23.627
And action.

32:25.497 --> 32:27.698
He's coming. Oh god.

32:28.919 --> 32:30.968
You have to shoot him. It's the only way.

32:41.949 --> 32:44.617
Oh no. No no no no!

32:44.651 --> 32:45.918
No no no. No.

32:46.920 --> 32:48.587
Okay, get Bay's close-up.

32:52.625 --> 32:54.759
And Emmett's.

32:56.762 --> 32:58.763
And cut!

32:58.797 --> 33:00.731
That's a wrap.

33:00.765 --> 33:03.600
Great job, everybody!
You should be so proud.

33:04.769 --> 33:08.222
That was amazing, even if I did kill you.

33:08.222 --> 33:10.775
Very moving. Very moving!

33:11.810 --> 33:13.878
Hey, you guys, look!

33:13.912 --> 33:16.681
- Oh wow.
- Look at the cake. What a great cake.

33:16.715 --> 33:19.381
What a cool cake.

33:20.315 --> 33:22.241
_

33:22.922 --> 33:24.857
Let's go inside. It's so cold, come on.

33:24.891 --> 33:27.959
- Inside!
- Have some cake and some hot chocolate.

33:30.797 --> 33:33.932
- Sweetie, congratulations.
- Thank you.

33:35.079 --> 33:36.063
- I'll see you inside.
- Yeah.

33:36.063 --> 33:37.669
Hey, Wilke, Wilke!

33:38.215 --> 33:39.671
You running off? You should stay.

33:41.359 --> 33:43.675
Sorry, I gotta get home
and do some homework.

33:44.539 --> 33:45.810
Yeah right. Come on, man.

33:46.128 --> 33:48.780
- Simone's blowing it off.
- Yeah well,

33:49.367 --> 33:51.816
Simone can get away with it.

33:52.314 --> 33:53.651
You okay, man?

33:54.067 --> 33:55.653
Yeah, just tired. All right.

33:55.688 --> 33:56.855
I'll catch you later. Okay?

33:56.889 --> 33:57.923
All right.

33:59.692 --> 34:01.593
- What was that?
- Nothing.

34:23.119 --> 34:24.784
I missed everything, didn't I?

34:28.353 --> 34:29.855
It's okay.

34:32.906 --> 34:35.007
I'm sorry. I had to go.

34:36.976 --> 34:38.143
I wish

34:38.178 --> 34:40.367
that I could say no when
work things come up,

34:40.367 --> 34:43.081
- but I can't.
- I get it.

34:45.184 --> 34:46.918
And I know that

34:46.953 --> 34:49.659
I can't give you fog machines

34:49.659 --> 34:52.723
and imported dutch-chocolate blood

34:52.757 --> 34:54.299
and whatever that maze thingy was.

34:54.299 --> 34:58.095
Mom, this isn't about money.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.798
It's not about things. I promise.

35:04.184 --> 35:05.485
Then what is it?

35:08.321 --> 35:10.968
I try not to think about it,

35:10.968 --> 35:14.426
but sometimes I can't help it. It hits me

35:15.115 --> 35:19.398
that there was this whole
childhood I was supposed to have.

35:22.337 --> 35:24.171
I know.

35:24.205 --> 35:28.109
And I'm not saying I didn't
love growing up with you.

35:28.558 --> 35:33.181
You gave me so much and you always
told me I could do anything.

35:33.215 --> 35:36.051
- You can.
- Then why didn't you think

35:36.085 --> 35:38.286
that I could handle
knowing about the switch?

35:39.585 --> 35:41.520
You were three years old.

35:42.522 --> 35:43.688
Okay,

35:43.723 --> 35:45.857
what about when I was five? Or seven?

35:45.891 --> 35:47.792
Or how about when I was 10?

35:50.662 --> 35:53.798
I guess I just...

36:00.191 --> 36:03.093
I didn't think that I could handle it.

36:05.483 --> 36:08.199
I've been trying

36:08.605 --> 36:10.246
to be okay with that,

36:10.569 --> 36:13.238
because I don't want to be
mad at you my whole life.

36:13.549 --> 36:16.809
I hate being mad at you,

36:18.078 --> 36:20.813
but there are so many memories here...

36:20.848 --> 36:24.250
handprints, birdhouses
and family vacations

36:24.284 --> 36:26.252
that I should have been a part of.

36:29.923 --> 36:30.959
I'm sorry.

36:32.926 --> 36:34.827
Me too.

36:42.495 --> 36:45.263
I'm gonna go upstairs.

36:45.297 --> 36:48.970
I think that they're having dessert

36:48.970 --> 36:52.605
and you should join them.

37:16.584 --> 37:17.818
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:18.227 --> 37:20.229
I thought you went to bed.

37:20.263 --> 37:22.097
I thought so too.

37:23.294 --> 37:25.261
Is there any cake left?

37:25.589 --> 37:28.197
No. Oh, but...

37:28.813 --> 37:30.532
You can have one of these. They're yummy.

37:31.511 --> 37:32.634
Zombie fingers.

37:33.276 --> 37:34.637
Oh, okay.

37:36.027 --> 37:39.077
Ugh, tomorrow there is going
to be a massive cleanup

37:39.077 --> 37:41.415
and I am in complete denial.

37:43.491 --> 37:46.104
I meant to say thanks

37:46.104 --> 37:49.156
for letting Daphne take
over your entire home.

37:49.156 --> 37:50.971
Well, it's her home too.

37:52.635 --> 37:54.402
And yours.

37:54.437 --> 37:56.771
I hope you both think of it that way.

37:56.806 --> 37:59.408
Um, I think we're still working on that.

38:00.776 --> 38:03.712
It's crazy sometimes to
think about how we got here.

38:05.368 --> 38:06.911
I think about it all the time.

38:08.252 --> 38:11.155
Maybe I don't think about it enough.

38:11.495 --> 38:14.291
I've gotten pretty good
at denial over the years.

38:17.827 --> 38:18.617
So...

38:20.652 --> 38:24.689
what exactly do you need?
Interviews, notes?

38:24.723 --> 38:27.559
- For what?
- Your book.

38:29.418 --> 38:32.721
I figure if my dirty laundry's
getting aired anyway,

38:32.756 --> 38:34.589
it might as well be you.

38:35.013 --> 38:37.486
- Really?
- One suggestion...

38:38.428 --> 38:41.863
make sure that you take
a really hot author photo,

38:41.863 --> 38:43.565
so Sarah Lazar can suck it.

38:48.471 --> 38:49.871
Was that Regina downstairs?

38:50.263 --> 38:54.409
Yep. She's says she's going to
cooperate with me on my book.

38:54.443 --> 38:56.812
Hey, that's great. What changed her mind?

38:57.164 --> 38:59.748
She wants to help me
kick Sarah Lazar's ass.

39:00.628 --> 39:01.816
You told her about that?

39:02.937 --> 39:05.487
Don't worry. I'm not
gonna put it in the book.

39:06.556 --> 39:08.423
Put what in the book?

39:12.704 --> 39:14.397
I don't feel like talking
about this right now.

39:14.431 --> 39:15.768
I'm exhausted.

39:20.397 --> 39:21.879
You know what, Kathryn?

39:23.208 --> 39:26.177
I really have nothing to
say to you right now.

39:29.133 --> 39:31.168
You don't believe me.

39:31.978 --> 39:33.227
You don't trust me.

39:36.134 --> 39:37.240
Good night.

39:50.769 --> 39:53.104
- Hey, where are you off to?
- I'm just taking Emmett home.

39:53.138 --> 39:54.287
Oh, that's nice.

39:55.975 --> 39:57.876
- Uh, dad?
- Yeah?

39:59.078 --> 40:01.046
Is everything okay with you and mom?

40:01.931 --> 40:04.116
Yeah yeah. Why?

40:06.090 --> 40:09.659
I just felt like something
was going on today.

40:11.062 --> 40:13.697
Well, your mom and I are
going through something,

40:13.731 --> 40:15.732
but it's not really
even worth talking about

40:15.766 --> 40:17.600
because it's going to be fine.

40:17.634 --> 40:18.901
Okay?

40:18.936 --> 40:20.372
We are committed to each other,

40:20.372 --> 40:23.613
and when you're committed,
you work things out.

40:36.074 --> 40:37.374
Hey.

40:39.211 --> 40:41.045
I couldn't sleep.

40:42.181 --> 40:43.281
Me neither.

40:57.969 --> 41:00.362
Are you up for a swim?

41:05.823 --> 41:06.657
Sure.

41:08.630 --> 41:11.109
Maybe we can make some
memories of our own.

41:21.976 --> 41:23.330
Is it cold?

41:23.330 --> 41:24.313
Chicken!

41:24.924 --> 41:27.229
Who are you calling

41:27.229 --> 41:28.193
chicken?

41:29.094 --> 41:30.620
You are such a chicken.

42:10.321 --> 42:13.123
Okay, what is going on?

42:16.293 --> 42:18.995
One minute you're here,
then all of a sudden

42:19.029 --> 42:21.063
you're... I don't know where.

42:21.203 --> 42:22.572
_

42:23.423 --> 42:25.270
_

42:27.103 --> 42:29.221
You hated your birthday. You can say it.

42:29.221 --> 42:32.082
_

42:34.202 --> 42:35.128
_

42:35.278 --> 42:37.079
Then what is it?

42:37.113 --> 42:39.181
We got through the deaf-hearing thing.

42:39.181 --> 42:40.298
We got through the Ty thing.

42:40.298 --> 42:42.297
We got through the custody thing.

42:42.297 --> 42:44.615
We said that we love each other.

42:44.615 --> 42:47.145
What is left for us to get through?

42:49.631 --> 42:50.828
Just tell me.

42:52.030 --> 42:55.668
Whatever it is, I can handle it. But

42:57.269 --> 43:01.238
we can't keep going
back and forth anymore.

43:02.274 --> 43:04.682
Either you're with me

43:04.682 --> 43:06.531
or you're not.

43:07.078 --> 43:08.946
Which is it?

43:17.380 --> 43:19.377
