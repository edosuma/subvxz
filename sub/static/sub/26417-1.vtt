26:28.387 --> 26:29.588
That girl who always
wears bunny ears?

26:29.689 --> 26:30.923
-She's crazy.
-She runs the school.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.191
And if she
breaks Graham's heart,

26:32.291 --> 26:34.593
I will chop off her feet
and turn them into keychains.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.362
-Huh?
-Just kidding.

26:36.462 --> 26:38.197
But I'll be really mad.
(indistinct talking
in distance)

26:38.297 --> 26:39.632
Oh, God, the new guy.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.868
...field trips? Actually,
are you insured drivers?

26:41.968 --> 26:43.936
We have got to deal
with him.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.605
But I have no time to be
handing out tacos all year.
No.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.174
Word.
I'm still in awe of how you
did away

26:48.274 --> 26:49.842
with last year's
Room Parent.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.111
You wiped all trace of us from
that phone tree.
It's kind
of my thing.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.446
Parents! Will Cooper!

26:54.546 --> 26:55.948
I just wanted to,
uh, circle back

26:56.048 --> 26:58.484
and see where we are
vis-à-vis committees.

26:58.584 --> 26:59.886
You know what?
Let me say it plain --

26:59.986 --> 27:01.988
we're not gonna do anything
you want us to do.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.555
No, man.
We're single parents.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.524
We don't volunteer.
We just try and survive

27:05.624 --> 27:07.960
until a time in the day when
it's appropriate to open wine.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.462
I don't know if you
heard my announcement,
but I'm single, as well.

27:10.562 --> 27:11.798
-We heard.
-We -- We heard.
-We heard, bro.

27:11.898 --> 27:13.733
So I have no wiggle room
on parent participation.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.202
You're in deep,
aren't you?

27:16.302 --> 27:17.804
Deep in what?

27:17.904 --> 27:19.405
The vortex.

27:19.505 --> 27:21.874
That place where you're
so wrapped up in your kid

27:21.974 --> 27:24.243
that you've lost all touch
with your adult life

27:24.343 --> 27:25.745
and the person
you used to be.

27:25.845 --> 27:29.415
I know,
'cause I've been there.

27:29.515 --> 27:32.151
* The wheels on the bus
go round and round *
(baby crying)

27:32.251 --> 27:34.520
* Round and round,
round and round *

27:34.620 --> 27:37.423
* The wheels on the bus
go round and round *

27:37.523 --> 27:38.390
(thud)

27:38.490 --> 27:39.859
It happens
to all of us.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.427
But (chuckles) I don't think
I'm in a vortex.

27:41.527 --> 27:44.697
Will, when was the last time
you stayed up past 10:00?

27:44.797 --> 27:45.865
In the nighttime?

27:45.965 --> 27:47.533
Okay, when's the last time
you made love?

27:47.633 --> 27:48.534
(laughing) Oh, my...

27:48.634 --> 27:50.202
It's okay.
There's no judgment here.

27:50.302 --> 27:51.537
This is a safe space.

27:51.637 --> 27:53.372
For real.
Yeah, just tell us.
Just ballpark.

27:53.472 --> 27:56.575
All right, ballpark...

27:56.675 --> 27:59.211
give or take a month,
it's been about...

27:59.311 --> 28:00.446
five years.

28:00.546 --> 28:01.714
-Oh, baby, no.
-Whoo!

28:01.814 --> 28:02.715
(indistinct shouting)

28:02.815 --> 28:03.850
-Dang!
-Oh, my God.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.584
You guys said that
this was a safe space.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.618
Not that safe.

28:06.719 --> 28:09.288
You know, what you need
is a date.

28:09.388 --> 28:10.356
Poppy?

28:10.456 --> 28:11.858
There. I made you
a Tinder account.

28:11.958 --> 28:14.060
How did you -- Is that my face
on Putin's body?

28:14.160 --> 28:15.527
Pushing you into
the deep end, Will.

28:15.627 --> 28:17.096
That's how we do this.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.131
If I'm being honest,
the timing's not great.

28:19.231 --> 28:20.699
It's 120 days
till Christmas --

28:20.800 --> 28:22.634
Are you gonna hide
behind that sign-up sheet

28:22.735 --> 28:24.036
or am I swiping right?

28:24.136 --> 28:25.537
I've got Room Parent
responsibilities --

28:25.637 --> 28:27.206
Swipe! Swipe!
I have no investment
either way.

28:27.306 --> 28:30.076
I've never done something
like this before, okay?
(chanting "Swipe!")

28:30.176 --> 28:33.212
You know what? Do it.
Swipe left!

28:33.312 --> 28:34.546
It's "swipe right."

28:34.646 --> 28:36.916
It's "swipe right,"
and you just said that. Sorry.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.389
Okay, okay, okay.
We got Emma, we got Amy,

28:43.489 --> 28:45.457
we got Rory, we got Graham.
Who are you?

28:45.557 --> 28:47.459
Wrong van, kid.
Get out of here. Beat it.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.596
Angie! Hey!
Will Cooper from yesterday.

28:50.696 --> 28:52.264
So, tonight's date night.
-Ooh.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.000
Remember, a real man
pays for dinner.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.468
Is that true? I mean, I don't
know by 2018's standards --

28:56.602 --> 28:58.237
Will, I say this
with an open heart

28:58.337 --> 28:59.738
and nothing but love --

28:59.839 --> 29:01.240
you're a disaster.
-Preach.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.242
Yeah, I don't know
if I'm a disaster.

29:03.342 --> 29:04.977
I mean, yes,
I'm experiencing some anxiety,

29:05.077 --> 29:06.745
but that's normal, okay?
And I'm just --

29:06.846 --> 29:08.280
Will. I don't have time
for this.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.515
-Oh.
-We got you the date,

29:09.615 --> 29:11.450
and now I have to babysit
everyone else's kids

29:11.550 --> 29:13.585
so I can have a Saturday night
to drink champagne out of a can

29:13.685 --> 29:15.354
and watch
a bird documentary.

29:15.454 --> 29:16.823
Okay, 'cause I was actually
coming over to say

29:16.923 --> 29:17.924
I could babysit today
if you wa--

29:18.024 --> 29:20.526
-We'll be there in 15 minutes.
-Oh, cool.

29:20.626 --> 29:21.627
* That's right
DIEGO: Yo, why did

29:21.727 --> 29:22.995
you bring your baby
to the sneaker line?

29:23.095 --> 29:25.131
'Cause free babysitting doesn't
just fall out of the sky.

29:25.231 --> 29:26.933
(scoffs)
(cellphone chimes)

29:27.033 --> 29:28.868
Oh, snap!
Free babysitting!

29:28.968 --> 29:30.436
All right, yo, hey.
Be right back.

29:30.536 --> 29:31.470
Wait --
Okay.

29:31.570 --> 29:32.704
I -- Imma come back.
Hold my spot.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.373
I -- I'll be back
without the baby. Just me.

29:34.473 --> 29:35.541
Hold my spot!

29:35.641 --> 29:36.843
**

29:36.943 --> 29:39.311
(doorbell rings)
Welcome, dudes! Will Cooper!

29:39.411 --> 29:41.347
Do you guys want to go
play in my room?

29:41.447 --> 29:43.182
The theme is
"tasteful unicorn."

29:43.282 --> 29:45.617
Thanks a lot. We'll be back
in a few. Good God.

29:45.717 --> 29:48.320
-This place is a wonderland.
-Every chair is a beanbag.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.656
There's no chair
that isn't a beanbag.

29:50.756 --> 29:53.125
All chairs
currently have beans.

29:53.225 --> 29:54.393
Indoor trampoline?

29:54.493 --> 29:55.962
So they can bounce
when it's raining.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.364
(door closes)
Will, sit down.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.699
(thud)

30:00.799 --> 30:03.069
What are you gonna wear
on your date tonight?

30:03.169 --> 30:04.636
-This?
-Oh, God.

30:04.736 --> 30:06.338
(chuckles)
Oh, you're serious.

30:06.438 --> 30:07.406
Or -- Or...

30:07.506 --> 30:09.708
(Zipping)
...I do have another option.

30:09.808 --> 30:10.910
Ah!

30:11.010 --> 30:12.044
Shorts!
(Jack cries)

30:12.144 --> 30:14.013
Y-Your pants are making
my baby cry, man!

30:14.113 --> 30:16.015
Make it stop.
Make it all stop.

30:16.115 --> 30:17.749
Here. Oh.
I know. I know.

30:17.850 --> 30:20.486
Rock, squat, pause.

30:20.586 --> 30:21.988
Rock, squat, pause.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.322
(crying stops)
Oh. There we go.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.824
Oh, my God.
What did you do?

30:25.925 --> 30:26.893
It's a little something
I call

30:26.993 --> 30:28.727
rock, squat, pause.

30:28.827 --> 30:29.862
-"Puss"?
-No.

30:29.962 --> 30:30.829
-"Puzz."
-Rock, squat --

30:30.930 --> 30:33.032
Listen --
rock, squat, pause.

30:33.132 --> 30:34.934
-Puh...
-"Pause." "Pause."

30:35.034 --> 30:35.834
Oh, "pause"!

30:35.935 --> 30:36.835
Say it with me.
Ro--

30:36.936 --> 30:38.504
-Never.
-Nah, man.

30:38.604 --> 30:39.605
What if I learn
to do that

30:39.705 --> 30:41.207
and then I haven't had sex
in five years

30:41.307 --> 30:43.609
and I'm wearing pants
that zip off into shorts?

30:43.709 --> 30:45.611
Give me my baby.
(Jack coos)

30:45.711 --> 30:47.279
Ah, you guys,
you're right.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.115
I-I -- I'm clearly
not ready, okay?

30:49.215 --> 30:51.183
I-I say we put the brakes
on the date tonight,

30:51.283 --> 30:53.285
okay, just until after
Taco Tuesday's figured out.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.787
I want to keep that guac
from browning --

30:55.888 --> 30:57.256
No. No. Focus.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.458
There's honestly a lot of fear
that's creeping in.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.060
-Take a deep breath.
-(exhales sharply)

31:01.160 --> 31:02.194
You're going on this date.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.463
(unsure) Good.
I'm excited about that.

31:04.563 --> 31:05.898
DOUGLAS: Hey,
so just making sure,

31:05.998 --> 31:08.034
you're gonna be taking
Emma and Amy tonight?

31:08.134 --> 31:10.869
Because I'm getting together
with my dermatologist pals.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.738
Oh, Rory wanted me
to ask you to come

31:12.838 --> 31:14.706
to his dance party
tonight.

31:14.806 --> 31:16.575
Aww, what a sweetheart.
Pass.

31:16.675 --> 31:18.477
I told you,
he's going through a thing.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.746
He won't even wear his favorite
leotard to school

31:20.846 --> 31:22.581
'cause he's scared other kids
will make fun of him.

31:22.681 --> 31:23.950
Well, of course they're
gonna make fun of him.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.117
When I was a boy,

31:25.217 --> 31:27.486
I got beaten up for smiling
at a basketball game.

31:27.586 --> 31:28.887
All right, look.
I don't know why,

31:28.988 --> 31:29.922
but my kid likes you.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.657
Okay? And in case
you haven't noticed,

31:31.757 --> 31:33.325
he doesn't have another man
in his life,

31:33.425 --> 31:35.227
so why don't you just
show up for him?

31:35.327 --> 31:38.264
I don't dance, okay,
especially with guys.

31:38.364 --> 31:41.000
You know, I still can't
wrap my head around this place.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.169
Why does every book have to be
on yoga and menopause?

31:43.269 --> 31:47.239
Douglas...
you are why we march.

31:47.339 --> 31:48.975
Oh, God.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.576
Yo, why do we
have to do this again?

31:50.676 --> 31:53.479
I just don't want to send him
out into the world like this.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.014
I mean,
it would be a crime.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.748
It's like leaving a baby
on a doorstep

31:56.848 --> 31:58.117
and hoping for the best.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.187
Miggy.
Hmm?

32:01.287 --> 32:02.354
You can't actually
do that.

32:02.454 --> 32:04.190
-(scoffs) I knew that.
-Just checking.

32:04.290 --> 32:06.592
I just don't want him
to bomb his date

32:06.692 --> 32:09.195
and start harassing us again
about hot lunch.

32:09.295 --> 32:12.364
This is the third pair
of earmuffs I have found.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.200
Who hurt this guy?

32:14.300 --> 32:18.204
"Zoe, I want to hug you
and give you all my gum."

32:18.304 --> 32:20.039
That's a great start.

32:20.139 --> 32:23.175
I've been in love with Zoe
since day one of kindergarten.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.111
Then she put those
bunny ears on --

32:25.211 --> 32:26.945
stick a fork in me,
I'm done.

32:27.046 --> 32:28.114
-It's your first love.
-(slurps)

32:28.214 --> 32:29.715
That's a big deal.
It's exciting.

32:29.815 --> 32:31.717
You shouldn't be afraid
to let your feelings out.

32:31.817 --> 32:32.784
Exactly.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.953
That's how I want to play it
with Zoe.

32:35.054 --> 32:37.223
Raw, open, positive.

32:37.323 --> 32:38.390
Oh, by the way,

32:38.490 --> 32:40.492
don't let my mom scare you
about the date tonight.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.861
She doesn't
believe in love because...

32:42.961 --> 32:44.796
my dad is kind of
a garbage human.

32:44.896 --> 32:47.033
That's good to know.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.635
But I'm gonna cut you off
on the juice boxes, 'kay, bud?

32:49.735 --> 32:52.671
Hey, Will? Angie says
I have to give you a makeover.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.841
(sighs)
This is my Everest.

32:55.941 --> 32:58.244
ANGIE: (in distance)
Oh, my God!

32:58.344 --> 33:00.679
**

33:00.779 --> 33:02.581
Angie, are you hurt?

33:02.681 --> 33:04.083
Why do you have this?

33:04.183 --> 33:05.217
Oh. (scoffs)

33:05.317 --> 33:07.153
Honestly, I've never
seen that before in my life.

33:07.253 --> 33:10.189
Dude, your wallet
is in here

33:10.289 --> 33:12.658
and a bag of popcorn
that's still hot.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.326
You've used this today.

33:14.426 --> 33:15.827
Yeah, I use it
for snacks, okay?

33:15.927 --> 33:17.996
Nobody ever tells dads
what to do about snacks,

33:18.097 --> 33:20.532
and this is a good
snack holder.

33:20.632 --> 33:26.238
It was actually my wife's...
before she left.

33:27.106 --> 33:30.542
Oh. I'm sorry.

33:30.642 --> 33:33.279
Do you think that
maybe there's a reason --

33:33.379 --> 33:34.713
I don't know, just
throwing it out there --

33:34.813 --> 33:39.918
that this is the bag
she didn't take when she left?

33:40.018 --> 33:41.520
(both laugh)

33:43.122 --> 33:44.756
Do you miss her?

33:44.856 --> 33:46.392
No.

33:46.492 --> 33:48.260
But I miss having someone,

33:48.360 --> 33:51.530
and not just for the bad stuff
or hard stuff or whatever,

33:51.630 --> 33:53.632
but -- but for
all of the good things,

33:53.732 --> 33:55.867
like when she
lost her first tooth

33:55.967 --> 33:57.636
and when she
told her first joke

33:57.736 --> 34:00.072
and the week she
demanded I call her

34:00.172 --> 34:01.607
"Jelly Bean
Teen Machine."

34:02.408 --> 34:05.711
Nobody tells you
how lonely it can be.

34:05.811 --> 34:09.815
One time, I made a boyfriend
out of a pile of laundry...

34:09.915 --> 34:11.250
and I rolled around
in him.

34:11.350 --> 34:12.384
(chuckles)

34:12.484 --> 34:13.752
It wasn't built to last.

34:13.852 --> 34:16.122
(both laugh)

34:16.222 --> 34:19.825
But when you have kids,
something happens to you.

34:19.925 --> 34:21.160
You become mush.
Mm.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.229
But you got to hide that.
That's what I tell Graham.

34:23.329 --> 34:26.165
Otherwise, that little weirdo's
gonna get his heart broken.

34:26.265 --> 34:27.399
I-I honestly don't know

34:27.499 --> 34:30.569
if I'm capable
of hiding my mush.

34:30.669 --> 34:31.770
I mean,
you guys are lucky.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.339
You have each other
to look out for one another,

34:33.439 --> 34:36.242
but it's just me.

34:36.342 --> 34:38.244
Do you ever
look at each other and go,

34:38.344 --> 34:41.079
"Ah, it takes a vill--"
Don't say it.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.281
Just throw out
the bag.

34:42.381 --> 34:45.584
Hey. Did Angie
text you her plan?

34:45.684 --> 34:47.119
Yeah, we help him
get ready for the date,

34:47.219 --> 34:49.288
and then we never
have to volunteer.

34:49.388 --> 34:50.589
Hello, ladies.

34:50.622 --> 34:52.158
-Hi, Dad.
-Hey, Dad.

34:52.258 --> 34:54.526
-Hey, girls. What are you doing?
-Will's floor mats.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.962
Would it kill him to shampoo
them once in a while?

34:57.062 --> 34:59.030
People don't think
that kids can buff and wax,

34:59.131 --> 35:00.532
but they're
the perfect height.

35:00.632 --> 35:04.136
Before I can commit to a blazer,
ask yourself --

35:04.236 --> 35:05.804
can this man pull off
this vest?

35:05.904 --> 35:07.105
I mean, he doesn't
have the arms,

35:07.206 --> 35:08.707
but, you know,
he might have the attitude.

35:08.807 --> 35:09.941
-No, no vest.
-Vest.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.943
-For the love of God, no vest.
-Mm-hmm. Vest.

35:12.043 --> 35:15.514
Maybe this
wants to live here,

35:15.614 --> 35:18.116
for tonight's dance party?
-I'm seeing it.

35:18.217 --> 35:19.785
-* Dance party
-Oh, okay, please.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.720
Forget it. We've been trying
to get him

35:21.820 --> 35:23.121
to sing and dance
for years.

35:23.222 --> 35:24.956
They're right.
I-I'm sorry, kid,

35:25.056 --> 35:26.358
but I'm not
going to the party.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.995
That's okay.
Maybe next time.

35:30.095 --> 35:31.230
(birds chirping)

35:31.330 --> 35:32.731
Nice, Douglas.
Real nice.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.300
Rory, I'll wear your vest.
-What?

35:34.400 --> 35:36.235
You don't have the right torso
for a vest, Mom.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.969
Stop trying
to make it happen.

35:38.069 --> 35:39.671
-Ah, I get it, Doug.
-Douglas.

35:39.771 --> 35:42.040
Afraid to risk
embarrassing yourself,

35:42.140 --> 35:43.709
but that's the greatest part
of parenting is,

35:43.809 --> 35:45.577
it gets you
out of your comfort zone.

35:45.677 --> 35:48.214
Look, I'm not interested
in leaving my comfort zone,

35:48.314 --> 35:49.915
and I haven't been
since my wife died.

35:50.015 --> 35:51.550
Oh, I'm --
No, no, I see
you want to hug me,

35:51.650 --> 35:53.652
and I'm gonna have to
stop you right there.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.521
I can't imagine
losing your best friend.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.856
She was a 26-year-old
exotic dancer.

35:57.956 --> 35:58.990
She looked great
in pants.

35:59.090 --> 36:00.492
Ain't love
a funny thing.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.494
Anyway, I said,
"Okay, I'll have kids,"

36:02.594 --> 36:04.095
thinking I would change
one diaper

36:04.196 --> 36:06.665
and get dementia right before
they hit their teens.

36:06.765 --> 36:09.501
Instead, she dropped dead
and left me with two baby girls.

36:09.601 --> 36:12.871
The point is, I don't need
any more surprises.

36:12.971 --> 36:16.608
All right, but it's never
too late to try something new.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.109
I think it'd be
good for you, Doug.

36:18.210 --> 36:20.512
Douglas.
I think it'd be good
for your girls.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.848
You don't have to
go it alone.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.383
I can be your friend,
Doug.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.017
Douglas.
It's Douglas.

36:26.117 --> 36:27.853
And I don't need
any more friends.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.755
The only reason
why any of us are here

36:29.855 --> 36:31.390
is so we can
get out of volunteering.

36:31.490 --> 36:32.624
Wait, hold on.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.394
Angie, is that true?

36:35.494 --> 36:36.562
Look...
(sighs)

36:36.662 --> 36:39.130
I told you about
Jelly Bean Teen Machine.

36:39.231 --> 36:41.367
Wait.
We wanted to help you.

36:41.467 --> 36:44.536
I mean, we do now.
-No, it's fine, honestly.

36:44.636 --> 36:47.205
We're not friends,
which is actually a good thing,

36:47.306 --> 36:49.908
'cause now I can admit I didn't
throw away the mermaid bag.

36:50.008 --> 36:54.646
I hid it in the petticoat
of Barbie B. Anthony!

36:55.447 --> 36:56.882
DOUGLAS: A man
with a mermaid bag.

36:56.982 --> 36:57.916
I blame Obama.

36:58.016 --> 37:00.319
I don't know
how to cover up my mush.

37:00.419 --> 37:01.753
But maybe
that's not a bad thing.

37:01.853 --> 37:04.590
Maybe you guys could actually
use a little bit more mush.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.558
Will, I will
hand out tacos.

37:06.658 --> 37:08.927
No. Don't, okay?

37:09.027 --> 37:10.662
It's just disappointing.

37:10.762 --> 37:11.797
I thought I'd finally
found

37:11.897 --> 37:13.932
a group
that I could share this with.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.834
It takes a vill--
-Don't say it.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.102
It takes a vill--

37:17.202 --> 37:18.136
-Stop!
-No, no.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.838
Well, thanks
for getting me a date,

37:19.938 --> 37:21.072
which I now have to go on.

37:21.172 --> 37:25.110
Sophie, I'm taking you
to Nana's.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.279
It takes a village.
Ha, I did it.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.250
Dang, girl.
I just love you.

37:32.351 --> 37:34.152
I love you, too, honey.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.854
And also you told me
five minutes ago.

37:35.954 --> 37:39.024
No, I was reading over
an e-mail to Zoe.

37:39.124 --> 37:40.959
I think it's good.
Send.

37:41.059 --> 37:42.461
(whoosh)
What? You sent?

37:42.561 --> 37:44.195
You got to put yourself
out there.

37:44.296 --> 37:47.866
Will gets it.
He told me to go for it.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.701
That was
a really fun dinner.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.102
I loved when you looked up
from your phone.

37:51.202 --> 37:53.038
But it is good that you got to
FaceTime with your sister.

37:53.138 --> 37:54.873
You guys worked through
so many issues.

37:54.973 --> 37:55.841
(door slams)

37:55.941 --> 37:57.208
Should we make out now?

37:57.309 --> 37:58.276
Gah.

37:58.377 --> 37:59.345
**

37:59.445 --> 38:01.347
Mwah. Mwah. Oh, wow,
this is happening.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.382
-Take your pants off.
-Get these jeans down.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.651
There we go. Okay.

38:05.751 --> 38:06.852
Oh.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.286
Oh,
the touch of a woman.

38:08.387 --> 38:11.022
(exhales sharply)
I love you.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.326
You what?

38:14.426 --> 38:15.827
(door slams)

38:15.927 --> 38:18.497
Good night.

38:18.597 --> 38:20.198
(sighs)

38:21.800 --> 38:23.301
Oh, my keys.

38:23.402 --> 38:26.405
(knocks on door)
Heather, please open the door.
Please let me in.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.640
(pounding on door)
I need to come
into your apartment.

38:28.740 --> 38:29.708
I'm just a dad who says

38:29.808 --> 38:31.577
"I love you"
a thousand times a day,

38:31.677 --> 38:33.879
and that's not a bad thing.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.582
Hi, are you in there?
I don't love you.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.817
I'm not even sure I like you.

38:38.917 --> 38:39.985
My keys are inside!

38:40.085 --> 38:41.720
(cellphone rings)
Heather -- Will Cooper.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.556
How could you tell Graham
to put himself out there?

38:44.656 --> 38:47.926
He's gonna get hurt.
Wait, why are you answering?

38:48.026 --> 38:49.695
Aren't you supposed to
be on a date?

38:49.795 --> 38:50.996
Well, I let out my mush,

38:51.096 --> 38:54.032
and now there's mush
all over this lady's apartment,

38:54.132 --> 38:56.034
and my keys
are locked inside.

38:56.134 --> 38:57.436
You guys were right.
I can't do this.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.204
(siren wails in distance)
But maybe that's a good thing,

38:59.304 --> 39:00.939
because I actually like
being single.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.574
It's gonna give me
more time to figure out

39:02.674 --> 39:03.909
Sophie's Halloween costume.

39:04.009 --> 39:04.943
She's going as a princess,

39:05.043 --> 39:06.445
but I have to find
my own spin on that.

39:06.545 --> 39:07.513
Uh, are those sirens?

39:07.613 --> 39:08.780
Yeah, but they're not for me.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.449
-Sir, don't move.
-Oh, they are for me.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.050
Oh -- Oh, my God.
Will. Will --

39:12.150 --> 39:13.351
-Hello, officers.
-Will, what's going on?

39:13.452 --> 39:14.386
Will Cooper.

39:14.486 --> 39:15.687
* That's right, hold it down

39:15.787 --> 39:18.790
(Jack coos)
Miggy! Emergency! Get in!

39:18.890 --> 39:22.193
Dude, tell your weird
parent friends to stay away.

39:22.293 --> 39:24.262
We got to earn respect
on the sneaker line.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.864
(Jack coos)

39:25.964 --> 39:27.566
(indistinct conversations)

39:27.666 --> 39:31.302
**

39:31.403 --> 39:34.039
So I cut off
the skin tag on the green,

39:34.139 --> 39:36.307
and I still managed
to make a birdie.

39:36.408 --> 39:38.444
(laughter)
Douglas.

39:38.544 --> 39:39.778
Will's in trouble.
We got to go.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.813
What, I-I --
I'm the only
babysitter you got,

39:41.913 --> 39:44.115
and I'm not afraid
to go on strike.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.818
**

39:46.918 --> 39:48.654
My ex, she's in the Sudan.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.656
She's a human-rights lawyer.
She's doing great work,

39:50.756 --> 39:52.424
and -- and, you know,
I don't fault her for that.

39:52.524 --> 39:55.994
I just -- I-I never imagined
raising a child on my own,

39:56.094 --> 40:01.066
and I think part of me still
feels like she's coming back.

40:01.166 --> 40:04.269
Dude,
she's not coming back.

40:04.369 --> 40:06.404
**

40:06.505 --> 40:10.408
We all got left,
but we're not alone.

40:10.509 --> 40:11.577
(gate closes)

40:11.677 --> 40:13.912
Officers, let him go.
He's not dangerous.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.313
Look at his shoes.
He's wearing Keds.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.082
OFFICER: His Keds
are not the issue, ma'am.

40:17.182 --> 40:18.249
But they are an issue.

40:18.349 --> 40:19.585
Look,
he didn't hurt anyone.

40:19.685 --> 40:21.352
Let's forget about this,
officers.

40:21.453 --> 40:23.254
Go ahead.
Get yourself something nice.

40:23.354 --> 40:24.322
I know what you make.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.157
Sir, put the money away.
You, come with us.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.159
(cellphone ringing)
I -- I'm so sorry.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.029
Sophie, hey.

40:31.129 --> 40:37.035
Dad, I know I said I didn't
need the song anymore, but...

40:37.135 --> 40:39.437
Of course.

40:40.806 --> 40:45.611
* I've been staring
at the edge of the water *

40:45.711 --> 40:48.313
* Long as I can remember

40:48.413 --> 40:52.651
* Never really knowing why

40:52.751 --> 40:58.456
* I wish I could
be the perfect daughter *

40:58.557 --> 41:01.126
* But I go back to the water

41:01.226 --> 41:05.631
* No matter how hard I try

41:05.731 --> 41:08.800
BOTH: * See the line
where the sky meets the sea *

41:08.900 --> 41:11.069
* It calls me

41:11.169 --> 41:14.573
* And no one knows

41:14.673 --> 41:17.242
* How far it goes

41:17.342 --> 41:19.344
EMMA: I knew it.

41:19.444 --> 41:21.379
-* What's beyond that line?
Will I cross that line? *
-He knows all the words.

41:21.479 --> 41:24.415
-* The line where
the sky meets the sea *
-That beautiful bastard.

41:24.516 --> 41:27.152
WILL: * It calls me

41:27.252 --> 41:30.321
* And no one knows
-Rory, would you like to dance?

41:30.421 --> 41:33.491
-* How far it goes
-The answer is always yes.

41:33.592 --> 41:38.496
-* If the wind in my sail
on the sea stays behind me *
-Hey.

41:38.597 --> 41:41.166
-* One day I'll know
-You're looking so good, Rory!

41:41.266 --> 41:42.500
* How far I'll go

41:42.601 --> 41:45.837
-Whoo! Go, baby!
-Whoo-hoo!

41:45.937 --> 41:48.173
(vocalizing)

41:48.273 --> 41:51.743
What's happening?
Who are these people?

41:54.245 --> 41:55.446
They're my village.

41:55.547 --> 41:57.616
-No, boo.
-You ruined it.

41:57.716 --> 41:59.718
Dad, you've got
to tighten up.

42:02.888 --> 42:04.956
**

42:05.056 --> 42:07.292
Mwah. Look at you
not asking for a scarf.

42:07.392 --> 42:08.293
Soph.

42:08.393 --> 42:11.597
-TOGETHER: No weakness!
-Yes. Ow.

42:11.697 --> 42:13.031
Rory.
-Douglas.

42:13.131 --> 42:15.967
BOTH: Rock, squat, pause.
Rock, squat, pause.

42:16.067 --> 42:18.036
-The -- The pause is a bounce.
-Oh, a bounce.

42:18.136 --> 42:21.139
(gasps) Guys. Zoe.
She's going for Graham.

42:21.239 --> 42:22.974
Don't let the bunny ears
fool you.

42:23.074 --> 42:25.777
She's a cold-blooded killer!
-Hey, hey, hey, hang on.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.412
He's got this.

42:27.512 --> 42:29.280
I got your e-mail.

42:30.481 --> 42:32.884
It shook me
to my core.

42:32.984 --> 42:36.888

42:36.988 --> 42:40.826

42:40.926 --> 42:42.327
She likes him.

42:42.427 --> 42:45.897
(gasps) That Easter freak
likes my kid!

42:45.997 --> 42:49.400
Aww, and they're sharing gum.
That's huge.

42:49.500 --> 42:50.602
It's gross.
-It is gross.

42:50.702 --> 42:51.837
But it's -- it's huge.

42:51.937 --> 42:54.773
I told you. Mush works.

42:54.873 --> 42:57.442
And from now on,
I will eat at restaurants

42:57.542 --> 42:59.077
that don't give out crayons.
-Whoo!

42:59.177 --> 43:00.178
-Yeah!
-I'm gonna maybe

43:00.278 --> 43:02.914
start drinking coffee
after 4:00 p.m.

43:03.014 --> 43:04.115
-Whoo!
-Sounds fine.

43:04.215 --> 43:06.317
I am out of the vortex!

43:06.417 --> 43:07.853
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

43:07.953 --> 43:09.154
Okay.

43:09.254 --> 43:10.756
Don't go up the slide.

43:10.856 --> 43:12.691
-* Oh, baby, please
-He's a long way from sex.

43:12.791 --> 43:14.626
I am out of the vortex!

43:14.726 --> 43:17.328
-* Give a little respect
-I watched a guy get crushed
by a forklift,

43:17.428 --> 43:18.864
but this is worse.
-Word.

43:18.964 --> 43:20.766
Third time's the charm.

43:20.866 --> 43:21.700
(grunts)

43:21.800 --> 43:24.703
* To me

43:26.137 --> 43:28.006
I'm out of the vortex!
