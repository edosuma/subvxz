00:15.100 --> 00:17.000
Get 'em, Jack!

00:20.600 --> 00:22.500
Yeah!

00:25.100 --> 00:28.400
- Come on! Up and down!
- Get the little runt!

00:33.900 --> 00:36.500
- Goddammit!
- (cheering)

00:36.600 --> 00:39.300
Go ahead, Bobby.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.400
(man) Hey, kids, cut it out. Come on.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.700
Break it up. Break it up. Kelly!

00:45.900 --> 00:49.800
Come on, Kelly. Break it up.
Cut it out. That's enough.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.600
I've been offered a tryout
with the Hamilton Mustangs.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.600
All right, Deaner.

03:53.700 --> 03:59.400
They came to one of my games. They've
got one spot open for their play-offs.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.700
- There's too much work to be done here.
- Dad, I can't wait any more.

04:06.900 --> 04:10.700
I gotta play junior if I'm ever gonna
play pro. All the scouts'll be there.

04:10.800 --> 04:14.500
I can't afford to hire someone
in your place.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.700
I figure maybe we could get a tractor
with my bonus money.

04:18.899 --> 04:21.300
Yeah. Like with Kelly's bonus?

04:21.399 --> 04:27.300
All he ended up with was a stick in the eye
and a $2,000 doctor bill.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.500
I'll pick up the slack, Pop.

04:31.700 --> 04:35.100
Yeah, how long do you think that'll last?

04:36.600 --> 04:40.300
I don't wanna be a goddamn farmer
the rest of my life.

04:41.700 --> 04:45.900
- He's just a smart-ass kid.
- We all were... for the first week.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.500
- He's so goddamn small.
- He'll grow.

04:49.700 --> 04:52.000
In a week?

04:52.200 --> 04:57.700
Let him go. He'll be back in two weeks
dragging his tail between his legs.

05:03.500 --> 05:07.500
(Kelly) Now, there's one thing
you're gonna have to learn.

05:08.300 --> 05:11.300
O Canada!

05:11.400 --> 05:15.000
Our home and native land!

05:15.200 --> 05:18.000
True patriot love

05:18.200 --> 05:21.300
In all thy sons command

05:21.400 --> 05:24.000
With glowing hearts we see thee rise

05:24.100 --> 05:27.100
Our True North strong and free!

05:32.900 --> 05:35.200
(Kelly) Hamilton Arena.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.100
He scores!

05:47.900 --> 05:49.700
You wanna come in?

05:49.900 --> 05:53.200
What? Hold your fucking hand, huh?

05:56.800 --> 05:58.800
You're on your own.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.200
Hey.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.900
Thanks.

06:12.100 --> 06:16.200
Forget it. You're worthless
around there anyway.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.700
Don't take any shit from them Canucks.

06:21.800 --> 06:25.600
To them, you're another wetback
crossin' the border to play their game.

06:25.700 --> 06:29.100
- They'll never catch me.
- They'll catch you.

06:45.400 --> 06:48.400
Where'd you get
these guys from, Ray? Mexico?

06:49.800 --> 06:52.700
(Ray) We're only looking for one player.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.300
Like that sorry son of a bitch
who just tripped over the blue line?

07:13.100 --> 07:18.100
Carl Racki. Six feet, 198 pounds. Played
tier two in the Western League last year.

07:18.200 --> 07:25.100
15 goals, 22 assists and - whoo! - 
378 minutes in penalties!

07:26.700 --> 07:27.700
(whistle blows)

07:27.800 --> 07:30.200
(referee) Help out! Help out!

07:49.700 --> 07:52.900
Dean Youngblood.
Five foot ten inches, 160 pounds.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.400
He's 17 years old.
He's an American kid from Stanton.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.500
Scored 92 goals this year so far
for the Stanton Flyers.

08:00.700 --> 08:04.000
125 assists and 14 minutes in penalties.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.700
That's Kelly's kid brother.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.100
Come on! Somebody hit the hot dog.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.600
- Why doesn't somebody hit him?
- They can't catch him.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.100
Put Racki across from him.

09:13.600 --> 09:16.200
- Look at him.
- He's goin' for it.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.300
- Stay down.
- Stay down.

09:26.800 --> 09:31.300
- Keep your head up, prick.
- Look where the puck is, asshole.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.600
Wanna go, pretty boy?

09:36.400 --> 09:39.000
Come on, come on, come on.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.600
Let's go.

09:47.700 --> 09:49.900
- He's outta here.
- Pup.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.700
(referee) Come on, take it easy.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.100
Bring him down to the other end.
You all right?

09:56.200 --> 09:58.100
- Yeah.
- You sure?

09:58.900 --> 10:01.500
What do you think, Murray?

10:01.700 --> 10:04.900
He fights like an old lady.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.600
("I'm A Real Man" by John Hiatt)

10:30.500 --> 10:34.200
- Looks good for about six.
- (player) Six? Come on, ten.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.400
- Where's the doc?
- What doc?

10:36.600 --> 10:39.400
- The one who's gonna sew my eye.
- You're looking at him.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.300
(laughter)

10:43.600 --> 10:47.000
Let's see. Where is the little bugger?

10:47.100 --> 10:48.700
Here we go.

10:48.900 --> 10:53.100
I do needlepoint too.
That's one of mine.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.700
Pretty good, huh?

10:54.900 --> 10:58.500
We got a team doctor
but he can't tie his shoelaces.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.900
A player gets cut,
he takes 30 minutes to close him up.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.100
By that time, the guy's lost
15 minutes of the game.

11:05.300 --> 11:09.900
So, anyway, Murray bought me this kit
and told me to learn.

11:10.100 --> 11:14.300
The first month
he stood beside me with a stopwatch.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.500
Yeah.

11:17.800 --> 11:22.200
Your eyes are better than mine.
Once I get it threaded, I'm OK.

11:22.300 --> 11:25.300
- (player) Mad butcher of Hamilton.
- Oh.

11:25.900 --> 11:29.300
I'm out of Novocain,
so this may hurt a little.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.700
OK.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.800
Here we go.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.400
Nothing to it.
Just like zipping up your pants.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.300
Six stitches, five minutes.

12:02.400 --> 12:06.300
Pretty good. Next year
we'll have you doing transplants.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.000
Get him a uniform.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.500
(player) Yeah, a nurse's uniform.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.700
Better make it extra small, Frazier.

12:23.700 --> 12:26.100
- (Murray) Can I talk to you?
- (Racki) Yeah.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.200
I'm gonna go with the other kid. I need
someone who can put the puck in the net.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.000
That pipsqueak?

12:32.200 --> 12:36.600
Maybe you can catch on with another
team. I only have one spot for the playoffs.

12:36.700 --> 12:42.300
- I kicked his ass all over the rink.
- But you're not as fast as he is.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.800
Don't worry. You'll be seeing me around.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.800
(players) Ooh!

12:52.100 --> 12:54.100
Save some of that for the ice, huh?

12:54.200 --> 12:57.800
All right. Mustangs out on the rink
in five minutes.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.300
(player) Go get him, killer.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.100
Shit!

13:26.200 --> 13:28.800
New uniforms for the playoffs?

13:32.100 --> 13:33.400
Nice.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.900
Fuck.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.900
The locker room is that way.

14:34.700 --> 14:38.900
I think he needs a shave.
What do you think, guys?

14:43.800 --> 14:47.200
- I already shaved.
- When? Last week?

14:49.500 --> 14:52.900
Don't think he knows what we mean.

14:54.900 --> 14:58.500
I think he's gonna do something funny.

14:58.600 --> 15:02.500
No. I think he's gonna... bolt!

15:04.200 --> 15:07.300
- You're goin' nowhere!
- On the table.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.900
Ding, ding! Paging Dr Sutton.

15:12.900 --> 15:15.700
The doctor is here. Scalpel.

15:15.800 --> 15:18.100
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

15:20.300 --> 15:23.000
Go for it. You wanted a doctor.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.300
- Shaving cream.
- Shaving cream.

15:27.700 --> 15:33.400
Hold him still, boys. We don't want
another Victor Gunderson incident.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.500
Poor Victoria.
And he had so much potential.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.700
Looky, looky!
This shouldn't take long at all.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.400
Press hard, Derek, it's really dull.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.900
OK.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.700
Yes?

16:25.900 --> 16:28.800
You must be one of Murray's boys.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.600
Come on in.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.900
I swear to God,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.900
sometimes I don't know whether I'm
running a boarding house or a hospital.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
More of Mr Frazier's embroidery.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.900
- What's your name, honey?
- Excuse me.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.800
I'm Dean Youngblood.

16:52.900 --> 16:56.400
Right. I'll show you your room, Dean.

16:56.600 --> 17:01.500
And then I'll show you the second most
important room in the house, the kitchen.

17:01.700 --> 17:04.599
By the way, I'm Miss McGill.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.400
(Miss McGill) Dean!

17:16.599 --> 17:18.500
Yep.

17:18.599 --> 17:21.000
Can you get the door, honey?

17:35.400 --> 17:39.700
I thought you might like a nice cup of tea.

17:39.900 --> 17:43.100
I do like all my boys to be comfortable.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.100
There we are.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.600
Well, you're settling in, I see.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.200
Goal.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.900
Shit. Excuse me.

18:01.100 --> 18:06.000
It might be a little bit warm.
Here, we can let it cool down.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.600
You know, Dean,

18:18.700 --> 18:24.100
I've been boarding hockey players
in this house for over ten years.

18:25.100 --> 18:27.600
These are some of my boys.

18:27.700 --> 18:30.600
Fred "The Hammer" Murphy.

18:30.800 --> 18:35.200
Defence. Six three, 210.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.300
Great thighs.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.400
Big shot from the point,
averaged only about 10 goals a year,

18:42.600 --> 18:45.200
but, boy, you remembered
every single one of them.

18:45.400 --> 18:50.100
St Louis, Detroit, Chicago, New York.

18:51.100 --> 18:54.000
They say he has an attitude problem.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.900
I always thought he was wonderful.

18:59.900 --> 19:02.600
(Miss McGill) One, two, three...

19:07.500 --> 19:09.500
She do it to me last year.

19:09.700 --> 19:12.400
She do it to me last night.

19:20.900 --> 19:24.800
The only thing better than
a glass of beer is tea with Miss McGill.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.800
Baf, baf, baf!

19:31.200 --> 19:34.200
Hey, I saw you try out.
You've got speed.

19:34.300 --> 19:35.400
Thanks.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.800
Fast legs, slow fists.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.400
- That guy suckered me.
- Poor baby.

19:40.600 --> 19:44.600
Maybe next time we can send you
a telegram. "Get ready for the right hook."

19:44.800 --> 19:47.400
Racki's brutal even for this league.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.300
That man, he's fucking an animal.

19:51.700 --> 19:54.800
Hey, cheers! Miss McGill!

20:03.800 --> 20:07.400
A round of tequila.
Con limones de cojones!

20:20.300 --> 20:22.600
To the game
and getting out of this hick town.

20:22.700 --> 20:26.000
Thank God there is still a sport
for middle-sized white boys.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.400
Amen!

20:31.200 --> 20:33.900
Lightweight.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.600
- Learn to take a drink, man.
- Fuck, I'm sorry.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.600
Yo! Another round.

20:45.900 --> 20:48.400
Local talent at three o'clock.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.500
Anybody we know?

20:52.700 --> 20:55.700
You take the one with the moustache.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.800
- Ladies, hi.
- Hi.

21:00.900 --> 21:03.800
- Good to see you.
- Hi.

21:03.900 --> 21:07.800
- I saw every game last year.
- I missed just one. That's cos I was sick.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.700
I missed three cos of haemorrhoids.

21:12.700 --> 21:17.000
What's so funny?
I had to have surgery. I'll show you.

21:17.100 --> 21:20.500
- Not right now, please.
- Maybe after a few more drinks.

21:20.700 --> 21:21.900
Maureen.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.200
- Oh, look!
- What?

21:44.300 --> 21:48.000
- (Maureen) I don't see anything.
- No, I guess not.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.000
So, bottoms up?

21:58.200 --> 22:00.100
(screams)

22:14.000 --> 22:16.700
I was wondering where those things were.

22:18.500 --> 22:23.500
- Yo! Two Bloody Marys!
- Tequila once again for the second time!

22:26.600 --> 22:28.400
Cheers.

22:29.100 --> 22:31.300
Cheers, man.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.700
(man) Hey, goddammit! Watch it!

22:42.100 --> 22:44.300
Ready?

22:44.400 --> 22:46.800
Cheers.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.800
(player) Cheers. Come on, let's go.
We're just gettin' started.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.900
Cheers!

23:06.900 --> 23:09.700
(whistle)

23:18.900 --> 23:21.300
Lookin' good, rookie!

23:42.600 --> 23:44.800
Fuck me.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.700
Youngblood and Sutton.

24:15.100 --> 24:18.500
- (player) Eat him up, Derek.
- Go get him, Sutton.

24:19.700 --> 24:22.100
(Murray) Let's see who wants it!

24:33.500 --> 24:36.300
(player) Back to the pond, rookie!

24:42.100 --> 24:46.600
All right? Come on.
You better take a break.

24:46.700 --> 24:51.600
Want some milk and cookies
or something? How about a little nap?

24:53.200 --> 24:57.800
Can I ask you a question?
How'd you get so horseshit in one day?

24:58.800 --> 25:02.300
- Maybe I made a mistake about you.
- I don't think so.

25:02.400 --> 25:06.100
You better know so. This isn't
some recreational hockey league.

25:06.300 --> 25:10.300
If you wanna be here tomorrow,
you better show me more than right now.

25:10.500 --> 25:13.200
Get out there! Go!

25:37.300 --> 25:38.800
How was it?

25:39.000 --> 25:42.900
It's your type of film. You'd love it.

25:43.100 --> 25:46.800
- I can't stand the sight of blood.
- Unless it's your own, right?

25:47.000 --> 25:49.800
That's right.

25:49.900 --> 25:52.800
- Want some popcorn?
- Sure.

25:53.700 --> 25:55.600
See you around.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.300
Book of the Month selection?

26:51.500 --> 26:53.400
I guess.

26:58.300 --> 27:00.300
- Here.
- Heavy.

27:00.400 --> 27:05.100
And no pictures. I'll buy it for you.
It'll give you something to do on the bus.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.200
And in bed.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.000
Thank you.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.300
And this.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.200
Thanks.

27:23.200 --> 27:27.000
I think all hockey players
should know how to read and write.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.000
- Ah, shit. The coach.
- Shit.

27:30.100 --> 27:31.900
Dad.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.200
Dad?

27:35.300 --> 27:36.800
Fuck me.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.500
Hi, Dad.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.600
- What's going on here?
- We met at the theatre.

27:45.700 --> 27:50.600
Well, in front of the theatre.
We were there together. Separately.

27:50.700 --> 27:54.500
We went to the bookstore.
She bought me a book.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.900
I see. Look, it's a quarter to ten.
You want a lift home?

28:14.100 --> 28:16.100
I'll be home later.

28:17.300 --> 28:19.300
10.30.

28:28.900 --> 28:33.000
I'm sorry. I probably got you into trouble.
I should have gone home with him.

28:33.100 --> 28:35.100
No.

28:35.300 --> 28:40.600
It's just been kinda hard
to meet people I can talk to up here.

28:40.800 --> 28:44.200
- Where's down there?
- The city.

28:44.400 --> 28:46.700
Buffalo?

28:46.800 --> 28:49.500
- New York.
- Yeah.

28:49.700 --> 28:51.600
I've heard of it.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.700
I like a man who's been around.
I grew up there when Dad was playing.

28:58.800 --> 29:02.500
My mom's still there.
She's remarried to some jerk.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.900
Pardon me - rich jerk.

29:06.100 --> 29:08.500
I've only been up here a couple of years.

29:08.600 --> 29:12.300
You oughta spend a Saturday night
in Stanton sometime.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.800
No, thank you.

29:14.900 --> 29:17.400
It's not like Murray doesn't try.

29:17.500 --> 29:22.000
He made me stick boy for the team, then
he wouldn't let me into the locker room.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.400
I can't imagine why not.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.900
Now he's got me on the Zamboni.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.800
My big goal in life is to do the ice
at Madison Square Garden.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.000
At least you have a reason to be here.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.400
Where else could I get
beaten up every day,

29:37.500 --> 29:42.700
treated like shit by a bunch of prima
donna Canadians, get my nuts shaved...

29:42.900 --> 29:45.600
Don't worry.
It grows back.

29:47.500 --> 29:50.400
At least you still have your own teeth.

29:54.100 --> 29:55.400
Or don't you?

29:57.300 --> 29:59.700
Yep, still mine.

30:06.200 --> 30:11.100
Look... I think you're real nice
and got a cute ass,

30:14.000 --> 30:19.500
but I don't think it's a good idea
if we see each other. OK?

30:25.000 --> 30:27.100
Thanks for the book.

30:28.700 --> 30:30.600
Sure.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.600
You're sure you don't want me
to walk you home?

30:39.600 --> 30:41.100
No.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.800
It's kinda hard to get lost in this town.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.100
(rock music)

31:11.800 --> 31:15.500
- This'll hurt me more than it'll hurt you.
- Yeah, right.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.800
What's with the rose?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.900
Fan club. Toronto chapter.

31:33.100 --> 31:35.000
Yeah?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.400
Got any more?

31:48.200 --> 31:50.200
(music stops)

31:50.300 --> 31:52.300
(hairdryer buzzes)

31:57.400 --> 32:02.300
How can you be thinking about the game
when you're styling your hair?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.200
Shit.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.200
Sometimes I wonder
if players today have it in here.

32:12.300 --> 32:15.300
You know what Gordie Howe's
bonus was when he signed?

32:15.400 --> 32:17.700
A jacket. A team jacket.

32:17.900 --> 32:19.600
Lousy agent.

32:19.800 --> 32:25.700
Now everybody wants a 20-year no-cut
contract and a second home in Bora Bora.

32:25.800 --> 32:26.800
Where's that?

32:27.000 --> 32:29.200
The way you looked at practice this week,

32:29.400 --> 32:34.000
you'll be lucky if you're drafted
by the Tallahassee Warthogs.

32:34.200 --> 32:37.900
You wanna go back to the farms?
And the mills and the mines?

32:38.100 --> 32:43.500
If you don't, you better start thinking
about this game right now.

32:45.700 --> 32:50.000
We'll start with Zeeny's line.
Hewitt and Weber on defence.

32:50.200 --> 32:53.100
Youngblood, take left wing
on Sutton's line.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.500
(cheering and whistling)

33:11.500 --> 33:13.400
Come on, Derek!

33:21.200 --> 33:22.200
Fuck!

33:32.000 --> 33:34.700
(ice hockey commentary on radio)

33:41.000 --> 33:44.300
Derek! Derek!

33:44.400 --> 33:46.500
Watch the offside.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.100
(whistle)

33:53.800 --> 33:56.900
- Stay on side, Youngblood.
- Pass the puck.

33:58.200 --> 34:02.300
- Don't tell me when to pass the puck.
- You want me to slow down for you?

34:02.400 --> 34:04.700
Settle this family squabble
some other time.

34:04.900 --> 34:08.500
I got another game to work next week,
if you don't mind.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.500
(player) Come on, ref! Drop it!

34:16.300 --> 34:18.199
Here, back.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.699
- Come on, I'm open.
- Don't play with it. Move it.

34:24.900 --> 34:26.900
Now!

34:29.300 --> 34:32.300
- Back! I'm open!
- Take it in!

34:32.500 --> 34:35.199
They look like they've been
skating together for years.

34:35.400 --> 34:39.900
Youngblood moves into the Toronto zone.
He's really showing some speed.

34:41.699 --> 34:43.199
(opponent) I got him!

34:43.300 --> 34:45.600
He moves to his left.
He skates around them.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.600
He's in alone on the goalie.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.400
- He scores!
- Way to go, Youngblood!

34:54.500 --> 34:56.500
(laughter)

34:57.600 --> 34:58.900
Shh!

34:59.100 --> 35:02.700
- Who's winning?
- Mustangs.

35:26.400 --> 35:30.100
(PA) Scoring for Hamilton,
number ten, Dean Youngblood.

35:30.200 --> 35:33.600
Assist from number nine, Derek Sutton.

35:33.700 --> 35:35.700
Nice move, rookie.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.800
Rossini, take Youngblood's next shift.

36:45.700 --> 36:46.800
Jessie.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.200
Oh! Agh!

37:21.300 --> 37:22.600
Dean?

37:22.700 --> 37:25.300
Is there any blood?

37:25.400 --> 37:28.000
You son of a bitch.

37:28.100 --> 37:33.000
Hockey players love the sight of blood.
Especially their own.

37:39.900 --> 37:42.200
I scored a goal.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.200
Really? I don't follow hockey.

37:46.300 --> 37:48.300
Or hockey players.

37:52.500 --> 37:55.900
You know, your dad benched me.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.800
Derek says it's because I'm seeing you.

38:02.800 --> 38:04.700
Maybe he's right.

38:06.600 --> 38:10.400
If I'm getting benched for something
I didn't do, I might as well do it.

38:10.500 --> 38:13.300
- Do what?
- Take you out.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.400
- Why do you think I'll go out with you?
- Cos your old man doesn't want you to.

38:23.700 --> 38:26.100
Sounds like a pretty good reason.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.400
(waltz music)

38:46.900 --> 38:50.600
It doesn't look like a Mustangs practice,
that's for sure.

38:50.700 --> 38:53.000
Is this where all the young people come?

38:53.200 --> 38:56.900
It's either this or Slumber Party Massacre.
Come on.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.800
Don't worry. I'll catch you if you fall.
Just hold onto the side and you'll be fine.

39:01.900 --> 39:03.800
There we go.

39:06.700 --> 39:08.800
There you go.
Looking better.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.900
Good. Keep going.

39:13.900 --> 39:16.900
- You're real coordinated.
- I'll play for New York someday.

39:17.100 --> 39:20.600
I think you oughta learn how to skate first.

39:23.100 --> 39:25.500
You two all right?

39:25.700 --> 39:28.400
Yeah, we're just fine.
It's his first time.

39:28.500 --> 39:32.800
You better stay alongside of the boards
or you're gonna get run over.

39:33.300 --> 39:35.200
OK.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.100
Come on.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.700
- (Dean) So, you can skate.
- (guard) Damn kids.

39:47.900 --> 39:50.300
Too bad for you, cos you're it.

40:04.900 --> 40:06.800
Hey, lady, slow down!

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
(blows whistle)

40:13.900 --> 40:15.000
Gotcha!

40:42.900 --> 40:44.800
(Murray singing)

40:48.600 --> 40:50.600
In here.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.100
Shit.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.600
Great voice.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.700
Closet crooner.

41:14.700 --> 41:17.200
"Mad Dog" Murray Chadwick.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.500
Look.

41:21.600 --> 41:24.100
Second row.

41:24.300 --> 41:27.100
I used to go to all the games.

41:27.200 --> 41:30.400
Right next to the penalty box
so you could be near your old man.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.600
He never lost a fight, did he?

41:32.700 --> 41:39.400
He wasn't just some goon. I was there
when he got a goal in an all-star game.

41:44.700 --> 41:48.100
All I remember is my dad
racing up the ice with the puck,

41:48.300 --> 41:53.100
got up to the blue line, cut across
the middle and then blasted it on the fly.

41:54.100 --> 41:57.400
Upper left-hand corner.
Goalie never moved.

41:57.500 --> 42:00.600
I thought you didn't follow hockey.
Or hockey players.

42:16.100 --> 42:18.100
What?

42:22.100 --> 42:25.000
Dean, what happens
if you don't make the pros?

42:25.100 --> 42:27.100
I'll make the pros.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.200
What if you don't?

42:31.700 --> 42:35.200
Ever since I was six years old,
I've been faster than anyone.

42:35.300 --> 42:40.500
Even kids three and four years older
than I was, they could never catch me.

42:40.600 --> 42:44.600
They used to try and beat the shit
out of me instead.

42:46.500 --> 42:48.500
We got this big pond on our farm.

42:48.600 --> 42:53.900
As soon as it would freeze over, me and
my brother Kelly would put on our skates.

42:54.100 --> 42:56.600
We'd stay out there all day long.

42:57.900 --> 43:02.900
It'd be dark by the time we got home. We
had to sit by the fire to thaw out our feet.

43:03.100 --> 43:06.100
My mom used to think we were crazy.

43:06.300 --> 43:09.300
I remember never wanting to come in
when I was young.

43:09.400 --> 43:13.300
When you were young.
How old do you think you are?

43:13.400 --> 43:18.900
17. If I don't sign a pro contract
in the next couple of years, I'm through.

43:19.000 --> 43:25.000
It's just the way it works. And I don't
wanna work in a goddamn mill or farm.

43:29.800 --> 43:32.500
What does your mother
think about all this?

43:32.700 --> 43:38.500
She left my dad and us about four years
ago. She doesn't know what's going on.

43:38.600 --> 43:40.000
I'm sorry.

43:42.700 --> 43:45.100
I guess she got tired of the farm too.

43:45.300 --> 43:51.200
My brother and I got used to her being
gone, but I don't think my old man has.

44:00.300 --> 44:02.300
- Still hurt?
- No.

44:10.100 --> 44:12.500
Maybe I will.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.600
Will what?

44:16.400 --> 44:19.200
Start following hockey again.

44:24.600 --> 44:26.600
(giggling)

44:33.500 --> 44:35.900
- Good book?
- Great writer.

44:46.700 --> 44:49.600
- It's a nice room.
- It's not bad.

44:49.700 --> 44:51.300
(bed springs creak)

44:51.500 --> 44:56.200
- Bed's a little creaky.
- Tell me about it. I use it every night.

44:56.300 --> 44:58.300
To sleep on.

44:59.200 --> 45:01.200
Of course.

46:31.500 --> 46:33.400
(kettle whistles)

46:35.100 --> 46:39.100
("Get Ready" by Diana Ross
and the Supremes on radio)

47:01.300 --> 47:03.700
(hums along to radio)

48:03.600 --> 48:05.700
No, no! Don't!

48:22.300 --> 48:24.300
(Jessie) Stop it!

48:38.700 --> 48:40.700
Room service?

48:48.400 --> 48:49.700
(bell rings)

48:50.500 --> 48:52.400
God, he's good.

48:55.500 --> 48:57.800
What about a shot of tequila?

48:58.900 --> 49:00.200
No way.

49:00.300 --> 49:07.200
So, did old lady McGill catch you before
or after you put the puck in the net?

49:11.800 --> 49:15.400
I would have loved to have seen
the look on her face.

49:16.800 --> 49:19.300
I think this is yours.

49:36.900 --> 49:38.000
(bell rings)

49:38.100 --> 49:40.000
Scores!

49:42.100 --> 49:45.600
So, does little boom-boom
have a crush on her?

49:46.900 --> 49:50.500
- Who? Miss McGill?
- Fuck you.

49:53.800 --> 49:57.100
- I guess I do.
- She is a fox.

50:09.700 --> 50:11.900
How long have the stitches been in?

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
A week.

50:17.100 --> 50:19.000
Where you going?

50:19.200 --> 50:21.200
I'm gonna take 'em out.

50:21.300 --> 50:23.900
Why?

50:24.100 --> 50:27.000
You don't want stitches in Thunder Bay.

50:27.100 --> 50:29.300
How come?

50:29.500 --> 50:32.000
They see 'em,
they'll try to open you up again.

50:32.200 --> 50:34.500
- That's nice.
- Sit down.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.400
Don't worry. I've only had
a couple of cases of beer.

50:48.200 --> 50:52.300
- You sure are a glutton for punishment.
- This wasn't my idea.

50:52.500 --> 50:57.500
I'm talking about taking out
Chadwick's only daughter. Hold still.

50:57.600 --> 51:00.400
I just looked at her once
and he benched me.

51:00.500 --> 51:03.100
You just want someone
to pass you the puck.

51:03.700 --> 51:07.500
Listen, little hot dog, I don't need you
to pass me the goddamn puck.

51:07.600 --> 51:11.000
I made 91 goals this year
before you showed up.

51:11.100 --> 51:15.200
Maybe you can play for
the Tallahassee Warthogs next year, boy.

51:18.600 --> 51:20.300
I don't give a shit where I play,

51:20.400 --> 51:24.700
as long as I go number one in the draft
and I sign the biggest contract I can.

51:24.800 --> 51:29.500
I've been busting my ass for four years
and I'm gonna get what's coming to me.

51:29.700 --> 51:34.100
I figure if I'm lucky, I can make
enough money to last me for a while.

51:34.300 --> 51:36.800
I'm not gonna be a lawyer or a doctor.

51:36.900 --> 51:38.800
That's for sure.

51:39.800 --> 51:42.300
I didn't even get to finish high school.

51:42.500 --> 51:46.400
But I can play the game, and so can you.

51:48.600 --> 51:51.800
But it's more than just skating fast
and shooting bullets.

51:51.900 --> 51:55.800
You gotta understand,
they got us by the balls, Deaner.

51:55.900 --> 51:59.500
We all wanna play so bad.

51:59.600 --> 52:03.400
That's all you wanna do
when you're growing up.

52:04.500 --> 52:08.800
Then you realise
that it's more than just a game.

52:08.900 --> 52:12.300
You gotta play it according to their rules.

52:18.200 --> 52:20.600
Do you still like playing?

52:22.500 --> 52:24.400
Fucking love it.

52:38.900 --> 52:45.200
(PA) The Hamilton Mustangs, winners
of their semifinal series against Toronto.

52:46.300 --> 52:49.400
Sutton. Careful out there.
You'll get your hair messed up.

52:49.500 --> 52:52.000
Go hump your St Bernard, scumnuts.

52:56.500 --> 52:59.900
(spectator) Hewitt,
learned how to skate yet?

53:10.100 --> 53:15.300
And now, returning home,
undefeated in their series against Calgary,

53:15.400 --> 53:18.800
our own Thunder Bay Bombers!

53:25.600 --> 53:28.200
I'll be a son of a bitch!
They picked up Racki.

53:28.300 --> 53:30.800
(Murray) Another animal for their zoo.

53:36.200 --> 53:38.100
- Three blind mice.
- Yeah.

53:42.900 --> 53:46.800
The series should be a classic,
as the slick Mustangs face the Bombers,

53:46.900 --> 53:49.200
the most intimidating team
in junior hockey.

53:49.400 --> 53:53.200
Starting line-ups for tonight's game.
For the Mustangs...

53:53.300 --> 53:56.500
(Murray) Sutton, Harris and Lynch. Go!

53:59.100 --> 54:03.000
Left wing, Lynch,
and centre, Sutton.

54:03.100 --> 54:06.400
For the Bombers: In goal, Lexler.

54:06.500 --> 54:09.200
On defence, Brown and...

54:09.300 --> 54:13.200
Gentlemen, it's a big series.
Play it tough and play it clean.

54:13.300 --> 54:16.000
(spectator) Rip their eyes out!

54:30.900 --> 54:34.800
What I wanna know is
why you guys aren't in the Ice Follies?

54:34.900 --> 54:38.100
You're my Junior A hockey team.

54:38.200 --> 54:42.400
I never saw such a sorry
bunch of losers in my life!

54:42.600 --> 54:46.400
The big mistake I made
was letting Racki go.

54:47.400 --> 54:51.300
He and the rest of them own you tonight.

54:51.500 --> 54:57.300
I got three bus tickets here to some
of your favourite Junior C hockey teams.

54:57.500 --> 54:59.400
Blind River,

55:00.500 --> 55:02.400
Medicine Hat

55:03.700 --> 55:05.500
and Squaw Island.

55:06.200 --> 55:12.800
If you don't want one of these - and I'll do
it too - you'd better start hitting out there!

55:12.900 --> 55:15.800
Let 'em know
you're in the same goddamn rink!

55:15.900 --> 55:22.100
I didn't drive up the fucking Arctic Circle
to get my ass kicked by these goons!

55:22.300 --> 55:27.900
First half you could skate around
with a carton of eggs and not break any.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.400
You're tougher than that.
You know it, I know it.

55:30.500 --> 55:33.400
We're in this together.
You're a team, a family.

55:33.500 --> 55:35.400
You wanna win?

55:37.000 --> 55:39.300
Start acting like one.

56:14.600 --> 56:16.800
Get out there!

56:22.700 --> 56:23.600
Let's go!

56:30.500 --> 56:33.600
Do it, do it!
Take your best shot!

56:35.300 --> 56:37.000
Hey, Youngblood!

57:17.400 --> 57:19.400
(siren)

57:49.000 --> 57:52.400
Youngblood, take left wing
from Naz in this period.

58:44.600 --> 58:46.000
Son of a bitch!

58:48.700 --> 58:52.800
(PA) Scoring for the Hamilton Mustangs,
number nine, Derek Sutton,

58:53.000 --> 58:56.900
on an assist from number ten,
Dean Youngblood.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.200
The rookie setting up Sutton
for his 93rd tally this year.

59:05.800 --> 59:07.600
(player) Go get him, Racki.

59:11.200 --> 59:14.100
(Murray) All right, move it, Derek!

59:18.500 --> 59:20.400
Shit!

59:43.000 --> 59:46.200
- I'm gonna carve you up, Racki.
- All right, settle down.

59:46.300 --> 59:49.300
He ain't hurt.
Get up, Racki.

59:49.400 --> 59:52.800
- Are you OK?
- Let's go, Hewitt. You got five for slash.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.700
- All right.
- What about the spear, man?

59:55.800 --> 59:59.800
- He's gonna get let Racki get away with it.
- What about the spear?

59:59.900 --> 01:00:04.200
You got two chances of winning this
argument - slim and none. Get in there.

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.300
You got ten!

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.700
Hey, Hannah, eat this!

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:16.400
That's the match!
Get the animal outta here!

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:20.200
Penalty against Hamilton,
number two, Duane Hewitt.

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.600
- Take a shower, Hewitt!
- Fuck off!

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:29.100
What about Racki? What is this? A tryout
for you, Hannah? You fucking blind?

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:32.000
Next player penalty, Hamilton.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.100
Why don't you use these?
You're missing a good game.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.400
Get somebody in the box. Now.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.900
Look, lights. Ice.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.700
You wanna spend the rest of the night
in the locker room, keep it up.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.800
A red line.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.100
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.400
Scoring for Thunder Bay,
his first goal in a Bomber uniform,

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.000
number 20, Carl Racki.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:22.000
Assist to number two, Dick Paradise.

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:25.600
- Chew on this, Chadwick.
- Chew on this, asshole.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:31.600
- Sutton, come on off the bench.
- I got a regular shift.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.900
Chadwick, what'd you feed 'em for lunch?
Chicken sandwiches?

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.900
Derek!

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.600
Hit him, Coach!

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.200
That's it. Relax and enjoy the game.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.200
Shoot it in!

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:23.200
Youngblood!

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.600
On the board!

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.500
I got him!

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.600
Shit!

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.200
All right, Youngblood!

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.400
- All right!
- All right, Dean!

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:24.200
Scoring for Hamilton, number ten,
Dean Youngblood, unassisted.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.300
Come on.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.800
- Jesus Christ.
- Ambulance.

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.000
Oh, man.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.200
How are you feeling?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.200
- Cold.
- What?

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:57.900
Cold.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:04.300
They put a plate in my head.
It feels like I'm still on the ice.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.900
It's like a filling for a tooth.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.600
Like a big, big, fucking filling.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.700
So what happened?

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.800
Racki blindsided you.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.800
Did you get that son of a bitch for me?

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.300
Yeah, I got him.

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:02.200
All right.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.900
Boom-boom.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:28.800
Yeah, the doc seemed to know
what he was doing.

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.600
He sure wasn't looking too good.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.300
I'm not sure about brain damage.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.100
You can't get a CAT scan
in that rock-bottom town.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:41.400
It's a damn shame. We're not gonna
get someone to take his place.

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:45.500
One more game
and we would have had it wrapped up.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.900
- Don't hang 'em up. Put 'em on.
- (all protest)

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.800
You heard me. Right now.
And no pucks. Contact drill.

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:41.400
Contact drill?!

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:48.300
You were lucky to win. Ten minutes
and they would have turned it around.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:52.100
So let's go.
Jordy, take centre for Sutton.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.200
You want somebody to dress you,
Youngblood?

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:05.400
Get your gear on and get on the ice.

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.400
Why?

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.800
Because I said so, that's why.

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:17.100
You wanna practise now?

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.899
You're not on the ice in five minutes,
you're off the team.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.200
And just keep walking, Youngblood.

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:39.000
All the way back to the farm.

01:08:44.899 --> 01:08:46.800
Come on, let's go.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.500
God.

01:09:22.899 --> 01:09:25.399
I should have done something.

01:09:26.899 --> 01:09:28.899
There's nothing you could have done.

01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.200
I could have hit Racki before he hit Derek.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.200
- You mean maim Racki?
- Why not? He deserved it.

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:39.700
Dammit! You're all alike!
It means that you're no better than Racki.

01:09:39.899 --> 01:09:44.200
- Derek wouldn't be in the hospital.
- So maybe it's Racki in the hospital.

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:46.700
Or maybe it's you, Dean.

01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:50.500
Maybe it's you
covered with bandages and tubes.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.600
Maybe it should be.

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:56.200
God, what are you saying?

01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:59.900
I watched that game
and I saw Derek lying there on the ice.

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:04.800
And I watched them take him out, and all I
could think about is what if it'd been you?

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.700
What if it was you?
Why don't you just quit?

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:12.400
I did! I walked off the team today.

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:19.100
For the first time in my life,
I didn't wanna play.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:23.600
Dean, it's only a game.

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:29.500
It's all I ever wanted to do.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:27.700
Gee, superstar,
you really showed 'em, didn't you?

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.400
"All I ever wanted to do was play hockey."

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.600
"But the guys on the other team
are real mean."

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.700
"And the coach, the coach isn't fair."

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.900
- "And my best friend's not feeling well."
- He's half-dead, you asshole!

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.300
I don't give a fuck if he's all the way dead.
Does that mean you are too? Huh?

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.900
I didn't bust my nuts
doing the work of two

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.700
so you could come back
and whine about hard-luck stories.

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:10.800
Would you rather spread manure

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.100
or play hockey for 20,000 people
at Madison Square Garden?

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.900
- Spread manure.
- You candy ass!

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.200
I got down on my knees. I begged them
to let me play. With one eye!

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:29.800
You think Derek would have hopped a bus
home if you cracked your skull open?

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.500
Huh?

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:36.500
There's no way. If you were so concerned
about him, you should have stuck around.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:39.300
You'd have had the rest of the series
to make Racki pay.

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:43.900
That'd have done Derek a lot of good.
They're gonna kick Racki out anyway.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.100
Wake up, superstar. This is junior hockey
now. He'll sit out one game max.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.400
If anything, he's strengthened
his bargaining position with the pros.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.400
Fuck!

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:05.300
And Chadwick is a real prick, huh?
He's the best coach in the league, Dean.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.300
He knows what it takes to be a pro.
You need it here.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:13.100
And you never quit. Ever!

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:25.100
I was only kidding when I said you'd be
back dragging your butt in two weeks.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.100
I'm half-ready to call 'em up,
see if they'll let me take your place.

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:46.200
You wouldn't have made it anyway.
All you could do was fight.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.600
Shit!

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.800
Push! Push!

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:46.300
Kelly, give me a minute.

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.700
"Mustangs ran into a Pearl Harbor of sorts
last night at the home rink,

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:01.000
when they were bombed off the ice

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:05.000
by the rough-and-tumble visitors
from Thunder Bay."

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:08.400
"The Bombers intimidated the Mustangs
from the drop of the puck,

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:12.300
as they checked them
from one end of the ice to the other."

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.600
"Without injured star Derek Sutton
and rookie Dean Youngblood,

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:18.700
they were unable to stage
an offensive threat."

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.800
"League officials announced
the suspension of a player."

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:24.900
"It was ruled the defence man
Duane Hewitt of the Mustangs

01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:29.700
will be disqualified
for the final game next week."

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.600
I don't see anything
about your buddy Racki in here.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.600
Just hit it, pillow hands.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.300
Don't worry. It's not gonna hit you back.

01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.700
Get your hands up high.

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:29.800
Keep 'em up there.

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:35.100
You're gonna lead with your left.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.300
Jab. Setting him up for the big right.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.600
Here's a combination.

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:55.600
Remember, though,
get that stick away from him first.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.300
You fuck!

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.400
Go ahead.
Give it a shot.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:26.700
See how easy that is?
No harder, no faster.

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:29.300
Jab, cross. Jab, cross.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:32.500
Go ahead. Try.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.900
Come on.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
His head's up here.

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:43.900
Good. Jab right.

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:46.500
Come up.

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.900
Good. Move it around.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.900
Finish him.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.700
What are you doing here?

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:44.000
If you're gonna go back,
I wanna make sure you're ready.

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:46.800
- I'm ready.
- Oh, yeah?

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:50.000
So hit me.

01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:56.000
I said hit me.

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:02.400
Hit me.
What are you waiting for? Come on.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:05.400
Come on. What are you waiting for?

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:20.300
You can learn to punch in the barn,
but you gotta learn to survive on the ice.

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:26.500
Come on. There's a couple of things
I might be able to show you.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:32.200
You gotta be able to keep your balance,
hold a guy off, maybe take a few punches.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.800
Come on, grab me.
Grab me. Come on.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.900
Come on, kid.
Show me something.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.800
Show me something. Come on, kid,
show me something. Come on, kid.

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:51.300
Christ, he's strong for a little guy.
Come on, kid.

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:54.400
Come on, kid.
Go for the jersey.

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:57.000
Goddammit! Pull it!

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.000
Why didn't you help me before?

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.600
Huh?

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:19.100
Why did you wait?

01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:23.800
I didn't want another son hurt.

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:33.200
Sometimes us old farts aren't so smart.

01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:39.200
So what else you got, Pop?

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.200
There might be a trick or two.

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:08.400
(PA) Let's hear a warm welcome for the
visiting team, the Thunder Bay Bombers.

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:23.600
This is the final game in the
Canadian Junior Hockey Championship,

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:26.700
the memorial cup going to the winner.

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.400
Are you gonna let me in, Fraze?

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:44.900
Let me get Murray. OK?

01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:52.100
Scratched from tonight's roster,
the following players:

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:56.600
For Thunder Bay -
number 27, Dennis Turnbull.

01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:00.900
And for Hamilton -
number two, Duane Hewitt,

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:06.600
number nine, Derek Sutton,
and number ten, Dean Youngblood.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.200
What are those for?

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:17.300
I wanna play tonight.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:23.600
You're a scratch, or didn't you hear?
You walked off the team. You're through.

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:26.600
- You need me.
- Think it's that easy?

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:33.400
If I get by you, will you let me play?

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.400
What makes you think you can get by me?

01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:50.000
(Derek) Let him in, Coach.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.200
Go ahead. Suit up.
I might use you.

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:15.900
So you decided to be a hockey player.

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:19.600
Yeah. I did.

01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.600
I figured you'd show.

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.500
You gonna watch?

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:36.400
No, I've never watched a game in my life.

01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:46.200
Listen, just forget about Racki, man.
He's not worth it.

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:49.500
Just go out there
and win that fucking game.

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:57.700
OK?

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:25.400
I would like to remind the audience that
the consumption of alcohol is prohibited.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:30.800
Violators will be prosecuted.
Thank you for your cooperation.

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:46.800
Ladies and gentlemen, number ten
for the Mustangs, Dean Youngblood,

01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:51.000
formerly a scratch,
will be in the line-up tonight.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.600
Last game, gentlemen.
Let's make it a good one.

01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:41.800
It's second period, Murray.
The kid's still sitting on the fucking bench.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:10.600
Scoring for the Thunder Bay Bombers,
number 20, Carl Racki,

01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:14.300
with assist going to number 15.

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.900
Why the hell doesn't he put him in?

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.800
Youngblood, take left wing.

01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:26.900
Youngblood, you forgot your helmet.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.200
It's about time, Chadwick!

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.100
Come on, Youngblood!

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.300
Huh? Huh?

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.300
Scoring for the Mustangs,
number ten, Dean Youngblood,

01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:09.000
with an assist going to
number four, Tom McCoy.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.900
Patrick. I got him.

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.700
Hey! I'm open!

01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:36.700
Cheap shot, cheap shot.
Hannah, open your eyes!

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.400
(Murray) It's a cheap shot.
You miss everything.

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.600
Why don't you use that whistle?

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:49.700
It's a five-minute major.
He's bleeding all over the ice.

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:51.700
(Frazier) Easy.

01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.400
- Let me see.
- (player) Fucking animal.

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.300
I gotta get him off.

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.600
For fuck's sake, not now.

01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:09.700
You'll be all right.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:28.900
The momentum has shifted back to
the Bombers, mounting another attack...

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.800
No nerve damage.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.800
You get a cap, it'll look as good as new.

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:55.100
One period left.
One period away from winning it all

01:29:55.300 --> 01:30:00.500
or losing to these hackers with their
shit-eating grins and wrestling tactics,

01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:05.200
from remembering something the rest of
your life or something you wanna forget.

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:09.000
How would you like to wake up at 3am
with the scoreboard flashing:

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:12.800
Bombers 2 - Mustangs 1?

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.300
Think about when
you're shaking their hands.

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:20.300
You wanna be able to look them
dead in the eye, not down at their skates.

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.300
Let's play some hockey!

01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:30.700
Shoot it, Dean!

01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:36.900
Why doesn't he hit him back?

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:51.700
Stick him! Stick him in the head!

01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:57.400
What's the matter?
Leave your balls at home, Youngblood?

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.300
Sit down and shut up, lard ass!

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:48.400
Scoring again for the Mustangs, with
only ten seconds left in regulation time,

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:52.000
Dean Youngblood, unassisted.

01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:05.000
There's the puck!

01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.700
Call it, Hannah!

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.500
Call it, you meat head!

01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:29.100
You crazy, Hannah?
There's three seconds left. Is that a call?

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:33.400
Attaboy, Hannah!
Attaboy! You're beautiful!

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:35.300
- What are you calling?
- Penalty shot.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:36.400
I love you.

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:38.800
- For what?
- Penalty shot, Hamilton.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.900
- Open your goddamn eyes.
- He tripped over his legs.

01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:45.100
- You pulled him down from behind.
- He took a dive.

01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:47.700
The rest of you guys
get to your benches.

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:49.300
Get outta here, Hannah.

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:55.200
Penalty shot awarded to the Mustangs,
number ten, Dean Youngblood.

01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:57.200
Son of a bitch.

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:01.300
(whistle)

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:24.600
Go on, Deaner. All yours.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:05.500
Scoring at 13:57 of the final period,
with only three seconds left in the game,

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:10.900
for the Mustangs,
number ten, Dean Youngblood!

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.300
Square off.
Keep your sticks down on the ice.

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:19.500
Get it down.

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:22.200
Rossini, take Youngblood out.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.500
Hold up, Hannah.

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:33.700
No guts, Murray, eh?

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.400
- I'm not coming off.
- The game's over.

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.300
No, it's not.

01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:47.700
Murray, I'm not coming off.

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:50.400
(Bombers' coach) Chadwick, quit stalling.

01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:54.600
Watch your stick.

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.000
I got it.

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:28.400
Let's go... pretty boy.

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:30.800
Let's go.

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.800
Get his stick away, Deaner!

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.800
Come on!

01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:05.100
I'm gonna shove that stick
right up your ass.

01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:09.000
- What stick?
- If they wanna fight, let 'em go.

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:15.200
Take your best shot, Youngblood.

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:27.800
All right! Yes!

01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:36.400
- Let's go.
- Come on, tough guy.

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.500
Come on.

01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:42.200
Come on, Racki.

01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:56.800
Get up!

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.200
Shit.

01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:02.300
Way to go, Deaner!

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:06.700
- Let me at him!
- (Dean) I'm waiting, Racki.

01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:11.300
Come on. Yeah!

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:39.600
(Hannah) It's all over, boys.
Let's go home.

01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:53.100
Jessie! Jessie!

01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:49.500
Hey, Dean. Can I have your autograph?

01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:54.100
Sure.

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:02.100
You guys got a pen or...?

01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:04.300
(all mumble) No.

01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:10.600
I have it.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.300
So how many goals
did you score last year?

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:20.300
- None.
- None? Why not?

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.100
Cos I'm a goalie.

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:25.900
Right.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.400
What about you guys?
How many goals did you score last year?

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:32.200
- I scored 30.
- Yeah? What about you?

01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:34.600
78.

01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:37.100
78, huh?

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:40.900
You'll be playing
for the Mustangs next year.

01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:45.100
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks a lot, Mr Youngblood.

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.200
What about me, Mr Youngblood?

01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:15.400
You look like shit.

01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:23.200
But I love you anyway.

01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:34.000
I'm sorry.

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:44.100
- Are you all right?
- I'll be all right.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.200
("Stand in the Fire" by Mickey Thomas)

Out in the night

01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:28.800
Out on your own

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.000
You don't care when they say
it's tough making it through

01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:39.800
Cos nothing can stop

Putting it all out on the line

You'll come to the wall

But you won't mind cos

01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:37.600
It's a test, a test of courage

01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:41.900
It's a game you play to win
