[music playing]

00:07.007 --> 00:09.377
Morning, ladies.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.344
Parkin.

00:10.378 --> 00:11.545
Manager.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.981
Nice to you see
you're right on time.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.317
Yeah, well, that's because
I have to leave early.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.986
Now, where can we go to
sit and drink coffee?

00:19.019 --> 00:22.956
Apparently, in your car.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.092
All right.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.626
Here, let me show you
the demonstration area.

00:25.659 --> 00:26.794
You'll be working
right down here.

00:26.827 --> 00:29.029
We're expecting a huge
crowd this weekend,

00:29.063 --> 00:31.632
and if you saw the
circular in today's paper,

00:31.665 --> 00:32.766
you probably know why.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.001
Oh.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.403
They got a newspaper
on the weekdays?

00:38.038 --> 00:40.608
Yes, they do.

00:40.641 --> 00:41.609
Ah.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.311
Here are two new
products we're rather

00:43.344 --> 00:45.846
excited about that you'll be
giving out samples of today.

00:45.879 --> 00:52.386
Soya sausage, right here,
and cheese in a can.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.921
Soya sausage.

00:53.954 --> 00:56.056
America's first
meatless, all-vegetable

00:56.090 --> 00:58.159
sausage-like product.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.428
Cheese in a can.

01:00.461 --> 01:03.131
Cheese-- in-- a-- can.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.569
All right, I've got a lot to
do, so I'll make this brief.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.539
Offer one sample to
the customer, just one,

01:11.572 --> 01:13.874
let them try it, then
suggest that they

01:13.907 --> 01:15.509
buy some to take home.

01:15.543 --> 01:16.944
You see?
Sound good?

01:16.977 --> 01:18.179
Sounds very good.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.414
Mr. Parkin, is there a
particular type of customer

01:20.448 --> 01:22.250
that we should be looking for?

01:22.283 --> 01:25.153
I like your pluck.

01:25.186 --> 01:30.158
Well, in our stock demographics,
each shopper we find

01:30.191 --> 01:31.792
is looking for
something different.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.061
Women in their 40s are
looking for quality,

01:34.094 --> 01:36.730
for example; women
in their 20s and 30s,

01:36.764 --> 01:38.466
looking for affordability.

01:38.499 --> 01:41.735
On the other hand,
men in their 40s are--

01:41.769 --> 01:43.137
Looking for
women in their 20s.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.476
Hey, how much are
we getting paid?

01:48.509 --> 01:51.945
$4.25 an hour, plus--

01:51.979 --> 01:54.715
and here comes the big money--

01:54.748 --> 01:58.552
$0.15 for every unit you move.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.221
Wow, I couldn't
be more excited

02:00.254 --> 02:04.225
if I knew how to multiply.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.527
So, if I have a
really good day,

02:06.560 --> 02:07.695
I could pay for
all those Christmas

02:07.728 --> 02:08.862
presents I just bought.

02:08.896 --> 02:13.767
Right, 'cause they were,
what, $0.15 a unit, too.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.304
Well, good luck, and
just remember the three

02:16.337 --> 02:18.172
rules of product sampling.

02:18.206 --> 02:21.141
Chase, tackle, threaten?

02:21.175 --> 02:25.746
Smile, sample, sell.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.416
Whatever.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.983
OK.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.985
So, which one do
you want, Roseanne?

02:32.019 --> 02:33.454
The soya sausages?

02:33.487 --> 02:34.988
Oh, yeah, you would
like that, wouldn't you?

02:35.022 --> 02:38.091
Because nobody is
going to buy that crap.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.528
Besides, if I go home
smelling like sausage,

02:40.561 --> 02:41.962
Dan will never let
me get any rest.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.636
Smile, sample, sell.

02:48.669 --> 02:52.873
Smile, sample, sell.

02:52.906 --> 02:55.976
Ah, well, hello there,
Mrs. John Q. Shopper!

02:56.009 --> 02:57.211
Smile.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.547
Would you like to try
some of our soya sausage?

02:59.580 --> 03:00.681
Sample.

03:00.714 --> 03:01.949
Why don't you take some
home for your family?

03:01.982 --> 03:03.050
They're bound to enjoy it.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.686
Sell.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.288
Sweet dammit, it works.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.627
Oh, relax, Jackie.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.329
You don't have to do anything.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.698
People will eat cotton
in a supermarket

03:17.731 --> 03:19.032
as long as there's
a toothpick in it.

03:21.769 --> 03:24.305
Hey, did you know you could
cure cancer with three

03:24.338 --> 03:28.141
cups of hot water and a pepper?

03:28.175 --> 03:31.144
Yeah, I know we just
took these jobs to bring

03:31.178 --> 03:32.480
in a little extra cash.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.949
But that doesn't mean we don't
have to take it seriously.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.751
All right, I am ready.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.321
Skillet's nice and hot,
I got the toothpicks,

03:40.354 --> 03:43.190
I got the napkins, everything
is handy, within reach.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.392
I got my backup here.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.429
People are going to start
flooding through that door

03:48.462 --> 03:49.630
any second.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.498
Don't you think you ought
to get your area ready?

03:57.070 --> 04:00.541
Come and get it
before it hardens.

[MUSIC - ED STARINK, ROSEANNE
THEME SONG]

04:44.718 --> 04:48.656
[music playing]

04:48.689 --> 04:50.391
You know, Dan,
since I'm helping you

04:50.424 --> 04:51.792
with this linoleum and all--

04:51.825 --> 04:54.027
Yeah, yeah, I'll help you put
new linoleum in your trailer.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.596
Well, who cares
about that, man?

04:55.629 --> 04:58.332
I want to be the first person to
slide across this in my socks.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.334
You'll be wearing
pants, too, young man.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.575
Hey, Deej.

05:07.608 --> 05:08.642
I thought this
might help you draw

05:08.676 --> 05:09.910
that cat for your art class.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.813
Now, you can use these pictures
to study bone structure,

05:12.846 --> 05:15.048
musculature, coloring.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.049
It's a cat calendar.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.785
I know.
Look at March.

05:20.754 --> 05:21.889
This is from 1987.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.524
I can't use this.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.192
All these cats are dead by now.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.863
That is not true.

05:29.897 --> 05:33.734
They're on a big farm
with a nice cat lady.

05:33.767 --> 05:34.702
Besides, I'm done.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.069
Well, wait a
minute, let me see.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.141
DJ, you were
supposed to draw a cat.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.445
- Read the bubble over his head.
- Meow.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.914
Sounds like a cat to me.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.950
David, DJ, get
in here a minute.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.318
Uh, DJ, I--

05:51.351 --> 05:53.954
I think you can do a lot better
if you just apply yourself.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.989
And you want to be proud
of this, don't you?

05:56.023 --> 05:57.124
I am proud of this.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.692
You try holding a cat
down with one hand

05:58.726 --> 05:59.627
and tracing it with the other.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.333
Now.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.502
I've got a very important
job for you guys.

06:08.536 --> 06:14.575
You stand in the corners
so it doesn't roll up.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.310
And if it does roll
up, don't worry.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.311
We'll get you out of there, man.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.750
Hey Mark, what
time is the movie?

06:22.783 --> 06:23.651
5:00.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.185
We gotta get going.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.787
DJ, you're just
going to ditch your art

06:26.820 --> 06:28.456
project to go to some movie?

06:28.489 --> 06:30.157
Yeah, he is.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.725
Van Damme is so cool.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.060
You know why?

06:33.093 --> 06:36.530
His last name's a cuss word.

06:36.564 --> 06:39.467
Uh, Mr. Conner, I don't
think DJ should go to a movie.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.735
Look, he's hardly put any
effort into this art project.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.170
Is that so?

06:43.203 --> 06:47.941
DJ, is this the absolute
best you can do?

06:47.975 --> 06:49.242
Yes, sir.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.310
Cool.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.211
Here's some popcorn money.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.714
Thanks, Dad!

06:53.747 --> 06:55.182
All right, you
just let DJ blow

06:55.215 --> 06:58.552
off his homework to go watch
some horribly violent movie.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.554
DJ doesn't have a
problem with violence.

07:00.588 --> 07:01.388
You've met his mother.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.461
Now, why don't you get me some
more of these encyclopedias.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.897
Oh, and try to keep them
in alphabetical order.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.833
I don't want to spend all
day putting them back.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.569
[music playing]

07:18.972 --> 07:22.242
OK, now, the trick is to aim
it right down the center aisle,

07:22.275 --> 07:23.644
there.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.379
And you gotta give it some arm,
too, 'cause some of them are,

07:26.413 --> 07:28.448
you know, two-liter
bottles right there.

07:28.482 --> 07:29.717
Now, I've been doing
this for a while.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.685
You guys should start
small, like, with a Cornish

07:31.719 --> 07:33.086
game hen or something.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.656
Oh.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.490
Strike!

07:42.530 --> 07:45.198
Here's a silly question.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.399
Could you stop doing that?

07:49.870 --> 07:54.975
I suggest you try taking your
job a little more seriously.

07:55.008 --> 07:58.078
Try to be more like Jackie here.

08:01.649 --> 08:05.285
Well, well, well.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.522
You know, Roseanne, you're
standing back of that skillet,

08:08.556 --> 08:10.190
and you feel all that heat,
and all that pressure,

08:10.223 --> 08:12.192
and you wonder why.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.862
And then one day, the
clouds part, and the manager

08:14.895 --> 08:18.065
throws a little bit of
sunshine in your life.

08:18.098 --> 08:21.034
And then you realize that he's
only a grocery store manager,

08:21.068 --> 08:24.605
and all the clouds come back.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.273
This isn't bad.

08:26.306 --> 08:29.042
Ooh, just got a
fish on the line.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.043
Not bad?

08:30.077 --> 08:32.980
Why, soy is God's
gift to arteries.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.381
That's a lovely
blazer you're wearing.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.116
That really brings out
the color in your eyes.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.017
Oh!

08:37.050 --> 08:38.586
Well, I-- I'll take three boxes.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.587
Oh, three?

08:39.620 --> 08:40.420
OK.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.696
Hey, that's really, a--

08:48.729 --> 08:51.565
great-looking sweatsuit
you got on there.

08:51.599 --> 08:56.136
Kind of matches the rug in
my husband's pickup truck.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.605
What's on the crackers?

08:57.638 --> 09:01.041
Oh, well, today we're sampling
some delightful aerosol cheese.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.042
It's great, I love it.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.111
I've been eating it all day.

09:04.144 --> 09:04.945
Just the one day?

09:08.548 --> 09:10.417
You're so witty.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.156
This cheese stuff sucks.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.224
I want to do that.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.158
You picked the cheese!

09:18.191 --> 09:19.326
That was your choice!

09:19.359 --> 09:21.695
You must be going
crazy from the soy fumes.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.030
You picked the cheese.
Cheese.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.131
OK, fine.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.699
Switch.
No biggie.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.034
I finally found
something I'm good at.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.535
I could sell anything.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.203
I'm crazy Jackie!

09:30.237 --> 09:31.504
I must be insane!

09:34.908 --> 09:38.545
You know, my advice to you
is, just do the best you can.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.847
It's not a competition.

09:43.984 --> 09:44.785
It is now.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.521
Hey.

09:48.555 --> 09:51.558
Hey, kid, get over here
and eat some of this.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.128
It's soy-tastic.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.964
Hey, these are good.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.166
Why don't you go tell your
mom to come over here and buy

09:59.199 --> 10:00.400
a few boxes of this for me?

10:00.433 --> 10:03.303
Oh, my mom's not here.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.371
Well, you got any money?

10:04.404 --> 10:05.272
No.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.708
Well, get outta here.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.047
[music playing]

10:16.149 --> 10:20.020
I'm sorry, but
this is not a cat.

10:20.053 --> 10:26.226
This is an amorphous smear
of existential nothingness.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.728
Oui, oui.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.597
Now let us retire to Henri's
and speak of revolution!

10:35.568 --> 10:37.537
Well, come on, Mr. Conner.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.072
Does this look
like a cat to you?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.841
If DJ says it's
a cat, it's a cat.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.577
Recovering from a stroke.

10:47.815 --> 10:51.351
Made all the more tragic by
his having no neck or legs.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.820
This is not a cat.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.988
You are boring me.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.824
He put zero effort into that.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.525
He should be home
right now redoing it.

10:58.558 --> 11:01.394
I already told him he
could go to the movies.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.896
That way, when I rent
it, he can point out

11:02.930 --> 11:05.699
where all the good nudity is.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.835
And you let him go
with Mark, of all people.

11:07.868 --> 11:08.736
So?

11:08.769 --> 11:10.270
So, Mark--

11:10.303 --> 11:12.139
Mark's Mark.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.473
Well, maybe one of
the reasons DJ's

11:13.506 --> 11:15.308
so lazy about his
schoolwork is that he hangs

11:15.342 --> 11:16.276
around with a guy like Mark.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.916
What's wrong with Mark?

11:22.950 --> 11:24.584
I'm just saying that
Mark's probably not the best

11:24.617 --> 11:26.019
role model in the world.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.055
And you certainly don't
want DJ taking after him.

11:28.088 --> 11:28.889
Why not?

11:32.993 --> 11:33.894
Mr Conner, I'm--

11:33.927 --> 11:34.995
No.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.296
Why wouldn't I want DJ
to be a stand-up guy

11:36.329 --> 11:38.431
who busts his ass to support
himself and his wife?

11:42.169 --> 11:43.470
Mr. Conner, all
I'm saying is that--

11:43.503 --> 11:46.273
I know what you're saying,
Dave, and I think it stinks.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.176
Mark may not be Einstein,
but you know what, he makes

11:49.209 --> 11:50.343
the most of what he's got.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.179
He tries.

11:52.212 --> 11:56.549
And that's more than I can say
for some people around here.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.885
Who, me?

11:57.918 --> 12:02.255
Wow, smart guys like
you catch on real quick.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.523
Hey, I try.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.025
No, David, you don't try.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.626
You work part-time
at a pizza parlor

12:06.659 --> 12:08.796
and you spend the rest of your
life sitting on the couch,

12:08.829 --> 12:11.832
making ironic comments
about everybody else.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.466
Irony is for people
who don't do anything.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.301
You get my drift?

12:16.937 --> 12:18.738
Mr. Conner, we're
talking about DJ here.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.207
Yeah, and you know
what the truth is?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.409
I'd rather have him hanging
around with Mark than with you.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.646
Excuse me, I got work to do.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.956
[music playing]

12:38.025 --> 12:40.593
Hey, look at me.

12:40.627 --> 12:43.030
I can barely keep
ahead of the demand.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.532
Hah, well, try to stay
ahead of this demand.

12:45.565 --> 12:48.335
Shut up.

12:48.368 --> 12:53.273
It just kills you that
I might be better than you

12:53.306 --> 12:54.975
at something.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.476
Actually, Jackie,
there's a lot of things

12:56.509 --> 12:58.111
you're better than me at.

12:58.145 --> 13:02.415
Finding unavailable men,
setting unreachable goals,

13:02.449 --> 13:04.651
and ass-kissing.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.319
What have you got there?

13:06.353 --> 13:08.255
Uh, soya sausages.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.958
Uh, not only good-tasting,
but good for you.

13:10.991 --> 13:14.361
I haven't eaten any,
and I feel like crap.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.064
Uh, cheese in a can!

13:17.097 --> 13:19.099
It's really good.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.868
And because these
are made without pork,

13:20.901 --> 13:23.904
you'll be tops with
your Jewish pals.

13:23.937 --> 13:27.274
Mmmm, yes, cheese in a can.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.243
It's really, really good.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.712
Now, that's what's known
as marketing, Roseanne,

13:32.745 --> 13:35.548
and man, oh, man,
am I good at it.

13:35.582 --> 13:36.449
You want marketing?

13:36.483 --> 13:38.618
I'll show you marketing.

13:38.651 --> 13:42.355
Attention, shoppers,
try soya sausages.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.225
Almost as good as the cheese,
but without the spider eggs

13:45.258 --> 13:46.059
and hair.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.233
That is not true.

13:53.266 --> 13:56.303
Truth has no place
in marketing, Jackie.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.337
And they cure cancer!

14:01.041 --> 14:03.443
Soya sausages,
the food of demons.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.845
Eat it and go to hell.

14:05.879 --> 14:08.916
Yeah, where you'll meet the
inventor of cheese in a can.

14:08.949 --> 14:12.719
Yeah, nice try, Roseanne.

14:12.752 --> 14:13.887
Nice try.

14:13.921 --> 14:19.459
In fact, that was
just grrrrrreat.

14:23.830 --> 14:28.335
Oh, Jackie, you and
your silly tricks.

14:28.368 --> 14:38.145
But, as everyone knows,
tricks are for kids.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.816
M&M chocolate candies.

14:43.850 --> 14:47.187
They melt in your
mouth, not your hand.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.165
You know, the best
part of waking up,

14:58.198 --> 15:00.533
Jackie, is Folger's in your cup.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.545
Ah!

15:12.579 --> 15:13.580
Dishwashing liquid.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.386
You're soaking in it.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.320
Say it.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.221
Say it.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.889
OK, all right, fine!

15:22.922 --> 15:24.224
You're better than me.
There.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.258
Madge.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.560
Five years ago--

15:27.594 --> 15:29.796
five years, at Uncle Wong's--

15:29.829 --> 15:31.264
I was handed a
fortune that said,

15:31.298 --> 15:33.300
someday your hidden
talent will be revealed.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.903
Today, that fortune
has come true.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.738
Congratulations, Jackie.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.674
You know how to sell cheese.

15:41.708 --> 15:46.513
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.984
Oh, Jackie?

15:51.018 --> 15:51.818
What?

15:53.820 --> 15:54.621
Got milk?

16:10.603 --> 16:11.404
Hello, ladies.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.379
How's your day?

16:22.382 --> 16:26.619
I see you're really throwing
yourself into your work here.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.520
Very impressive.

16:27.554 --> 16:28.755
Ha ha ha.

16:28.788 --> 16:29.589
Get out.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.096
You mean, we don't
work here anymore?

16:36.129 --> 16:40.533
I don't even think
I work here anymore.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.601
That's fine, then.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.636
So, who do we go see
about getting paid?

16:46.639 --> 16:50.510
[music playing]

16:50.543 --> 16:51.978
Can I give you
a hand with that?

16:52.011 --> 16:52.812
No, I got it.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.185
Mr. Conner, I've been
thinking about what you said.

16:58.218 --> 17:02.255
Um, it really made
a lot of sense.

17:02.289 --> 17:06.393
So, I, I've, uh,
decided I need a change.

17:06.426 --> 17:07.660
I need a big change.

17:07.694 --> 17:11.798
So, um-- I'm going to move out.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.537
Look, I didn't mean to be
that hard on you earlier.

17:17.570 --> 17:20.140
Hey, I'm not asking
for an apology.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.808
I just don't know why the
hell you got so upset.

17:24.744 --> 17:25.612
You don't?

17:25.645 --> 17:28.248
No.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.050
You mean, in that deep,
sensitive soul of yours,

17:31.084 --> 17:32.685
you can't understand
why I might be

17:32.719 --> 17:35.688
upset when you rip apart Mark--

17:35.722 --> 17:38.825
a guy that doesn't read
much, he's not book smart,

17:38.858 --> 17:41.961
but he works real hard every
day at the Lanford City Garage

17:41.994 --> 17:43.596
to support his wife
and his family.

17:43.630 --> 17:47.634
You can't understand why
that might not upset me?

17:47.667 --> 17:48.935
I think I can.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.271
Um, uh-- I'm a little
scared to say it now.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.944
Mr. Conner, I, I'm sorry.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.779
I should not have put
Mark down like that,

17:59.812 --> 18:02.782
and I certainly didn't
put down anyone else.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.389
Forget it.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.890
And you're right.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.694
I should get off the couch
and apply myself more.

18:14.727 --> 18:15.695
Yeah.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.030
That's good.

18:18.064 --> 18:19.932
So, are we OK now?

18:19.966 --> 18:21.000
Yeah Cool.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.807
You know, Mrs. Conner is
going to love this new linoleum.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.142
No, no, no, no.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.810
Don't tell her it's new.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.212
See, every couple
of years or so, she

18:32.245 --> 18:34.080
asks me to clean
behind the stove,

18:34.113 --> 18:35.982
and I've always found that
doing this is much easier.

18:40.653 --> 18:44.056
So David, what's
your time frame?

18:44.090 --> 18:45.124
For what?

18:45.158 --> 18:45.958
For moving out.

18:49.562 --> 18:52.232
But we just sort of
made up and everything.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.966
Well, yeah, I know,
but you're the one

18:54.000 --> 18:55.968
that said you should move out.

18:56.002 --> 18:58.171
Yeah, well, I, I just
said that so that you

18:58.205 --> 19:00.707
could talk me out of it.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.243
I think we're just holding you
back by letting you live here.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.577
Oh, no you're not.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.379
Yeah, we are.

19:06.413 --> 19:09.516
I mean, it was great when
you were in high, school

19:09.549 --> 19:11.117
but now you're a man.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.920
No I'm not.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.923
I know it's hard for you
to hear, but you are a man.

19:16.956 --> 19:17.990
Stop saying that.

19:18.024 --> 19:18.825
I said I was sorry.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.630
David.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.232
David, you didn't think
we were going to let

19:25.265 --> 19:26.333
you live here forever, did you?

19:29.068 --> 19:30.169
I don't know.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.504
Not forever.

19:31.538 --> 19:32.539
Come on, David.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.246
May take me a while
to find a place.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.780
That's OK.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.283
I'm not kicking you out.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.517
Yes, you are.

19:44.551 --> 19:45.752
Yeah, I guess I am.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.391
I never had to do this before.

19:51.424 --> 19:54.361
All the other kids couldn't
wait to get out of here.

19:54.394 --> 19:59.198
So then, shouldn't my loyalty
buy me an extra month or two?

19:59.232 --> 20:01.934
Done.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.169
You're going to be OK, David.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.040
Yeah.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.976
OK.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.379
Dan?

20:12.412 --> 20:15.415
Yeah, you'll see.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.384
It'll be fun.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.719
Couple, three months from now,
you'll be out on your own,

20:19.752 --> 20:21.521
you'll have a job.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.156
Before you know it, you'll
start feeling more grown up.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.292
Just like your brother Mark.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.092
Wheee!

20:29.195 --> 20:32.098
[music playing]

20:34.200 --> 20:36.002
Good evening, everybody,
I'm Verne Lundquist,

20:36.035 --> 20:37.804
and welcome to
beautiful Lanford,

20:37.837 --> 20:41.240
Illinois, where fans are going
wild over what they hope will

20:41.274 --> 20:43.776
become a new Olympic sport.

20:43.810 --> 20:47.547
And here comes our first
competitor onto the floor now.

20:47.580 --> 20:51.684
Scott Hamilton, Olympic champion
and a gutty little competitor,

20:51.718 --> 20:54.787
has left the ice behind
for the exciting new sport

20:54.821 --> 20:56.889
of linoleum sock skating.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.157
Now, watch.

20:58.190 --> 21:00.760
He's going for the triple
wally with a split twist.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.228
Oh, he backed off.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.798
Might have been worried
about that kitchen cabinet.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.233
Wonderful.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.837
And now, here comes the
hometown favorite, Mark Healy,

21:10.870 --> 21:12.572
for the pas de deux
portion of the routine.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.545
A beautiful maneuver.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.847
This is an important
day for Mark Healy.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.282
He missed the nationals
last year because he

21:23.316 --> 21:24.351
got on the wrong bus.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.993
And here comes the finale.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.466
Lovely.

21:39.499 --> 21:43.169
Well-deserved bows for national
treasure Scott Hamilton

21:43.202 --> 21:47.306
and for Mark Healy,
hard-working dumb guy.
