09:46.758 --> 09:49.675
ON ME ?

09:49.675 --> 09:52.467
? WITH PLENTY OF SNOW ?

09:52.467 --> 09:55.300
MISTLETOE,

09:55.300 --> 09:57.508
PRESENTS WRAPPED 'ROUND

09:57.508 --> 09:58.675
THE TREE ?

09:58.675 --> 10:00.175
? OW ?

10:00.175 --> 10:04.217
? CHRISTMAS EVE WILL TELL ME

10:04.217 --> 10:07.883
WHERE THE LOVE LIGHT BEAMS ??

10:07.883 --> 10:09.425
>> HENRY?

10:09.425 --> 10:10.842
>> YEAH?

10:10.842 --> 10:12.592
>> WHAT WAS THE FAVORITE PART OF

10:12.592 --> 10:13.258
YOUR LIFE?

10:13.258 --> 10:14.758
WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE PART

10:14.758 --> 10:15.633
OF YOUR LIFE?

10:15.633 --> 10:16.383
>> MY LIFE?

10:16.383 --> 10:17.592
WELL, PART OF MY LIFE

10:17.592 --> 10:18.800
WAS RIDING A BICYCLE,

10:18.800 --> 10:19.883
GROCERY BOY...

10:19.883 --> 10:21.633
>> WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT

10:21.633 --> 10:22.883
RIDING A BICYCLE?

10:22.883 --> 10:25.467
>> THAT'S WHERE I MADE MY MONEY.

10:25.467 --> 10:27.800
>> Sacks: SO, IN SOME SENSE,

10:27.800 --> 10:29.883
HENRY HAS RE-ACQUIRED HIS

10:29.883 --> 10:32.467
IDENTITY FOR A WHILE THROUGH THE

10:32.467 --> 10:33.883
POWER OF MUSIC.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.925
>> Mike: WHAT DOES MUSIC

10:35.925 --> 10:36.967
DO TO YOU?

10:36.967 --> 10:39.217
>> IT GIVES ME THE FEELING OF

10:39.217 --> 10:40.467
LOVE, ROMANCE.

10:40.467 --> 10:42.592
FIGURE RIGHT NOW, THE WORLD

10:42.592 --> 10:44.592
NEEDS TO COME INTO MUSIC,

10:44.592 --> 10:45.425
SINGING.

10:45.425 --> 10:47.675
YOU GOT BEAUTIFUL MUSIC HERE,

10:47.675 --> 10:49.550
BEAUTIFUL, OH, LOVELY.

10:49.550 --> 10:51.717
AND I FEEL A BAND OF LOVE,

10:51.717 --> 10:52.758
OF DREAMS.

10:52.758 --> 10:55.050
THE LORD CAME TO ME, MADE ME

10:55.050 --> 10:55.758
HOLY.

10:55.758 --> 10:57.883
I'M A HOLY MAN, SO HE GAVE

10:57.883 --> 10:59.342
ME THESE SOUNDS.

10:59.342 --> 11:01.925
LET'S SAY I MEET YOU...

11:01.925 --> 11:03.592
LET ME SEE...

11:03.592 --> 11:06.842
? ROSALIE, WON'T YOU LOVE ME ?

11:06.842 --> 11:08.842
? ROSALIE WONT YOU BE SWEET

11:08.842 --> 11:10.550
AND KIND ??

11:10.550 --> 11:11.508
>> Mike: WHAT DO YOU

11:11.508 --> 11:12.675
THINK HAPPENED WITH HENRY?

11:12.675 --> 11:13.925
I MEAN, WHAT DID WE JUST SEE

11:13.925 --> 11:14.925
HAPPENING WITH HENRY?

11:14.925 --> 11:17.342
>> WE CONNECTED WITH HENRY.

11:17.342 --> 11:20.092
WE CONNECTED WITH HENRY'S SELF.

11:20.092 --> 11:21.758
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE IN

11:21.758 --> 11:23.508
A NURSING HOME OR WHEN YOU

11:23.508 --> 11:25.842
HAVE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, YOU'RE

11:25.842 --> 11:28.092
REALLY STRUGGLING WITH YOUR OWN

11:28.092 --> 11:29.967
THOUGHTS AND CONFUSION...

11:29.967 --> 11:32.050
>> DAN WAS EXCITED.

11:32.050 --> 11:33.675
I WAS EXCITED.

11:33.675 --> 11:37.342
WHAT IF ALL THESE PEOPLE WE'D

11:37.342 --> 11:40.842
SEEN COULD BE AWAKENED LIKE

11:40.842 --> 11:42.092
HENRY?

11:42.092 --> 11:43.133
>> Dan: ALL A SUDDEN,

11:43.133 --> 11:44.175
EVERYTHING FALLS INTO

11:44.175 --> 11:45.300
PLACE AND YOU'RE RIGHT

11:45.300 --> 11:46.508
THERE WITH THE MUSIC, YOU

11:46.508 --> 11:47.258
UNDERSTAND IT.

11:47.258 --> 11:48.467
IT'S PLEASURABLE.

11:48.467 --> 11:50.175
YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT

11:50.175 --> 11:51.842
ANYTHING ELSE, YOU'RE NOT

11:51.842 --> 11:52.717
STRUGGLING.

11:52.717 --> 11:56.508
>> OH, HOW LOVELY!

12:01.092 --> 12:05.175
>> THIS IS NO SMALL PROBLEM.

12:05.175 --> 12:07.842
THERE ARE FIVE MILLION PEOPLE

12:07.842 --> 12:10.217
IN AMERICA WITH DEMENTIA.

12:10.217 --> 12:13.342
10 MILLION PEOPLE SPEND A LARGE

12:13.342 --> 12:16.383
PART OF THEIR LIFE CARING FOR

12:16.383 --> 12:17.300
THEM.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.342
THERE ARE MAYBE A MILLION

12:19.342 --> 12:21.217
PEOPLE IN NURSING HOMES

12:21.217 --> 12:21.967
LOSING THEIR

12:21.967 --> 12:23.050
CONNECTION TO LIFE.

12:23.050 --> 12:24.383
>> LET ME GIVE YOU A KISS.

12:24.383 --> 12:28.550
C'MON, SWEETHEART!

12:28.550 --> 12:30.383
MMM.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.717
DAD!

12:31.717 --> 12:33.300
HELLO.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.675
HELLO!

12:34.675 --> 12:37.092
JOHNNY?

12:37.092 --> 12:38.258
HEY, JOHNNY!

12:38.258 --> 12:41.175
HOW ARE YOU?

12:41.175 --> 12:46.300
>> I MEAN, ISN'T THIS DESIRE --

12:46.300 --> 12:48.925
A DESIRE TO AWAKEN ANOTHER

12:48.925 --> 12:51.508
PERSON, TO WHAT THEY ARE,

12:51.508 --> 12:55.175
TO WHAT THEY COULD BE --

12:55.175 --> 13:01.300
A DEEP PART OF BEING HUMAN?

13:01.300 --> 13:03.883
>> HOW OFTEN DOES ANYBODY HAVE

13:03.883 --> 13:06.592
A CHANCE TO AFFECT THE LIVES OF

13:06.592 --> 13:08.800
A MILLION OR MORE PEOPLE?

13:08.800 --> 13:10.675
I'M HOPING PEOPLE ARE READY TO

13:10.675 --> 13:12.467
COME ALONG ON THIS JOURNEY...

13:12.467 --> 13:13.842
HERE YOU GO..

13:13.842 --> 13:15.300
YOU HOLD THIS.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.717
THERE YOU GO.

13:17.717 --> 13:20.133
>> ??

13:20.133 --> 13:24.175
>> WE ALL KNOW MUSIC IS MAGIC.

13:24.175 --> 13:27.300
>> Man: I FEEL LIKE I'M

13:27.300 --> 13:30.008
ONE WITH THE WORLD.

13:30.008 --> 13:32.467
>> AND FOR THOSE WITH DEMENTIA,

13:32.467 --> 13:34.633
IT CAN BE A BACK DOOR INTO

13:34.633 --> 13:35.633
THE MIND.

13:35.633 --> 13:38.508
>> Sacks: THE PARTS OF THE BRAIN

13:38.508 --> 13:40.508
WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN

13:40.508 --> 13:42.467
REMEMBERING MUSIC AND

13:42.467 --> 13:44.633
RESPONDING TO MUSIC ARE

13:44.633 --> 13:46.842
NOT AFFECTED TOO MUCH IN

13:46.842 --> 13:49.050
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE OR OTHER

13:49.050 --> 13:50.175
DEMENTIAS...

13:50.175 --> 13:52.050
>> PART OF THE REASON WHY

13:52.050 --> 13:53.675
MUSICAL MEMORIES ARE

13:53.675 --> 13:54.800
SO STRONG HAS

13:54.800 --> 13:56.883
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE WAY

13:56.883 --> 13:59.050
MUSIC ENTERS OUR BRAIN IN THE

13:59.050 --> 14:00.133
FIRST PLACE.

14:00.133 --> 14:02.300
>> MUSIC HAS MORE ABILITY TO

14:02.300 --> 14:04.092
ACTIVATE MORE PARTS OF

14:04.092 --> 14:05.592
THE BRAIN THAN ANY

14:05.592 --> 14:06.925
OTHER STIMULUS.

14:06.925 --> 14:10.633
MUSIC SEEMS TO BE A CULTURAL

14:10.633 --> 14:12.967
INVENTION WHICH MAKES USE OF

14:12.967 --> 14:15.550
PARTS OF THE BRAIN DEVELOPED FOR

14:15.550 --> 14:16.967
OTHER PURPOSES.

14:16.967 --> 14:19.717
NOT ONLY AUDITORY PARTS,

14:19.717 --> 14:21.758
BUT VISUAL PARTS,

14:21.758 --> 14:23.050
EMOTIONAL PARTS,

14:23.050 --> 14:24.800
AND AT THE LOWER LEVEL,

14:24.800 --> 14:26.842
IN THE CEREBELLUM -- ALL THE

14:26.842 --> 14:28.925
BASIC PARTS FOR COORDINATION.

14:28.925 --> 14:31.925
>> WHEN WE ARE YOUNG, MUSIC

14:31.925 --> 14:35.092
RECORDS ITSELF IN OUR MOTIONS

14:35.092 --> 14:36.800
AND EMOTIONS.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.842
LUCKILY, THESE ARE THE LAST

14:38.842 --> 14:40.342
PARTS OF THE BRAIN

14:40.342 --> 14:42.133
TOUCHED BY ALZHEIMER'S.

14:42.133 --> 14:46.008
>> ??

14:46.008 --> 14:47.217
>> Vinny: GREAT SONG.

14:47.217 --> 14:48.883
>> YEP.

14:48.883 --> 14:52.425
CAN WE HOLD HANDS A LITTLE BIT?

14:52.425 --> 14:54.050
AH, THAT'S BETTER.

14:54.050 --> 14:56.550
WE'RE TOO FAR FROM EACH OTHER.

14:56.550 --> 14:59.967
>> Sacks: FOR THE PATIENTS WITH

14:59.967 --> 15:02.883
ALZHEIMER'S, IT HAS TO BE

15:02.883 --> 15:05.383
MUSIC WHICH HAS MEANING FOR THEM

15:05.383 --> 15:06.883
AND IS CORRELATED

15:06.883 --> 15:08.842
WITH MEMORY AND FEELING.

15:08.842 --> 15:09.925
>> ? HOLD YOU SO MUCH ??

15:12.092 --> 15:14.175
>> AND BY EXCITING OR AWAKENING

15:14.175 --> 15:15.800
THOSE PATHWAYS, WE HAVE

15:15.800 --> 15:17.967
A GATEWAY TO STIMULATE AND REACH

15:17.967 --> 15:19.717
SOMEBODY WHO OTHERWISE IS

15:19.717 --> 15:21.008
UNREACHABLE.

15:22.133 --> 15:24.217
>> YEAH, IT'S NOT AN

15:24.217 --> 15:26.133
EASY LIFE FOR YOU.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.800
I LOVE YOU.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.133
>> I LOVE YOU, TOO.

15:41.592 --> 15:43.633
>> Yvonne: I HAVE ONE RESIDENT

15:43.633 --> 15:45.758
THAT BARELY OPENED HER EYES, SHE

15:45.758 --> 15:46.883
DIDN'T RESPOND.

15:46.883 --> 15:48.800
AS MUCH AS I TRIED -- I KNEW

15:48.800 --> 15:50.258
HER FOR TWO YEARS --

15:50.258 --> 15:52.342
NO MATTER WHAT I TRIED, MASSAGE

15:52.342 --> 15:53.425
WOULDN'T WORK,

15:53.425 --> 15:58.342
NOTHING WORKED.

15:58.342 --> 16:00.258
BUT WHEN WE GOT INTRODUCED TO

16:00.258 --> 16:01.883
THE iPODS AND THE FAMILY

16:01.883 --> 16:03.675
TOLD ME THE THINGS THAT SHE

16:03.675 --> 16:05.592
LIKED, IT WAS AMAZING ONCE WE

16:05.592 --> 16:07.008
PUT THE iPOD ON HER.

16:07.008 --> 16:11.925
SHE STARTED SHAKING HER FEET,

16:11.925 --> 16:16.050
SHE STARTED MOVING HER HEAD.

16:22.133 --> 16:26.300
HER SON WAS JUST AMAZED...

16:26.300 --> 16:27.383
OKAY, CAN WE STOP?

16:27.383 --> 16:28.383
'CAUSE NOW I'M...

16:28.383 --> 16:29.383
GETTING --

16:29.383 --> 16:34.550
I'M SEEING HER ALL OVER AGAIN.

16:38.883 --> 16:41.383
>> WHAT WE'RE SPENDING ON DRUGS

16:41.383 --> 16:43.758
THAT MOSTLY DON'T WORK DWARFS

16:43.758 --> 16:45.717
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO DELIVER

16:45.717 --> 16:47.300
PERSONAL MUSIC TO EVERY

16:47.300 --> 16:48.967
NURSING HOME RESIDENT IN

16:48.967 --> 16:49.717
AMERICA.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.717
>> Dan: THAT'S TO PAUSE IT, TO

16:51.717 --> 16:53.133
START IT UP AGAIN,

16:53.133 --> 16:55.425
AND HIT THE BUTTON AGAIN.

16:55.425 --> 16:57.467
>> COULDN'T BE EASIER.

16:57.467 --> 16:58.133
YES.

16:58.133 --> 17:00.550
>> SO WHY DON'T THESE PEOPLE

17:00.550 --> 17:02.883
HAVE THEIR MUSIC ALREADY?

17:02.883 --> 17:04.800
AND WHY DOES IT TAKE

17:04.800 --> 17:07.008
AN OUTSIDER LIKE DAN TO

17:07.008 --> 17:10.342
GET IT FOR THEM?

17:10.342 --> 17:14.092
>> ? OOH ??

17:14.092 --> 17:16.133
>> IN TODAY'S REALLY CRAZY

17:16.133 --> 17:17.883
SYSTEM, I CAN SIT DOWN

17:17.883 --> 17:19.633
AND WRITE OUT A SCRIPT

17:19.633 --> 17:21.300
FOR A $1,000 A MONTH

17:21.300 --> 17:23.383
ANTIDEPRESSANT, NO PROBLEM,

17:23.383 --> 17:24.592
NOBODY ASKS ANY QUESTIONS.

17:24.592 --> 17:28.717
>> ? OOH ??

17:28.717 --> 17:31.967
>> IF I WANT TO PROVIDE A PERSON

17:31.967 --> 17:34.592
WITH A $40 PERSONAL MUSIC

17:34.592 --> 17:37.758
SYSTEM, THAT WILL TAKE A LOT OF

17:37.758 --> 17:38.633
WORK,

17:38.633 --> 17:41.217
BECAUSE PERSONAL MUSIC DOESN'T

17:41.217 --> 17:43.925
COUNT AS A MEDICAL INTERVENTION.

17:43.925 --> 17:46.050
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

17:46.050 --> 17:48.175
IT'S SORT OF A SIDE THING OVER

17:48.175 --> 17:48.758
HERE.

17:48.758 --> 17:50.717
THE REAL BUSINESS, TRUST ME,

17:50.717 --> 17:52.342
IS IN THE PILL BOTTLE.

17:52.342 --> 17:53.633
>> OPEN FOR ME.

17:53.633 --> 17:56.050
>> Thomas: OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

17:56.050 --> 17:58.342
IMAGINES THE HUMAN BEING TO BE

17:58.342 --> 18:00.425
A VERY COMPLICATED MACHINE,

18:00.425 --> 18:01.592
AND WE'VE FIGURED OUT

18:01.592 --> 18:02.800
HOW TO TURN THE DIALS.

18:02.800 --> 18:03.675
BLOOD PRESSURE?

18:03.675 --> 18:05.175
OH, TURN THAT DOWN, YOU KNOW?

18:05.175 --> 18:05.925
BLOOD SUGAR?

18:05.925 --> 18:07.008
OH, TURN THAT DOWN.

18:07.008 --> 18:09.550
WE HAVE MEDICINES THAT CAN

18:09.550 --> 18:11.383
ADJUST THE DIALS.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.842
WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING,

18:13.842 --> 18:16.883
MEDICALLY SPEAKING, TO TOUCH THE

18:16.883 --> 18:19.592
HEART AND SOUL OF A PATIENT.

18:19.592 --> 18:21.425
>> GIL?

18:21.425 --> 18:23.300
>> YES?

18:23.300 --> 18:24.800
>> THEY WANT YOU UPSTAIRS.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.592
YOU HAVE TO COME TAKE YOUR MEDS.

18:26.592 --> 18:27.175
>> MMM.

18:27.175 --> 18:28.758
>> NO, YOU REFUSED THIS MORNING,

18:28.758 --> 18:29.800
SO THEY WANT YOU TO

18:29.800 --> 18:30.967
COME NOW AND TAKE THEM.

18:30.967 --> 18:31.425
>> NO.

18:31.425 --> 18:33.258
>> LISTEN, YOU KNOW IT'S

18:33.258 --> 18:34.550
IMPORTANT, OKAY?

18:34.550 --> 18:36.217
LOOK HOW YOU'RE ACTING,

18:36.217 --> 18:38.342
OKAY, YOU NEED YOUR MEDICATION.

18:38.342 --> 18:40.467
WELL, GIL IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.550
AS YOU CAN SEE, HE'S A BIG GUY,

18:42.550 --> 18:43.883
HE'S A STRONG GUY.

18:43.883 --> 18:45.508
WHEN HE GETS AGITATED,

18:45.508 --> 18:47.092
WE REALLY NEED THINGS IN PLACE

18:47.092 --> 18:48.508
THAT ARE GOING TO WORK AND

18:48.508 --> 18:49.342
WORK QUICKLY.

18:49.342 --> 18:52.842
>> MY ANGER MANIFESTS ITSELF IN

18:52.842 --> 18:55.842
VERY MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.

18:55.842 --> 18:59.633
THE ANGER IS THERE, BUT

18:59.633 --> 19:04.092
SOMETIMES I CAN'T EXPRESS IT.

19:04.342 --> 19:07.133
>> Man: I LIKE TO THINK OF

19:07.133 --> 19:09.925
DISTRESS AS COMMUNICATION.

42:19.717 --> 42:21.717
ALL OF THIS STUFF, LET ME SORT

42:21.717 --> 42:22.425
IT OUT.

42:22.425 --> 42:23.633
FRANK SINATRA...

42:23.633 --> 42:26.842
>> Mike: HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

42:26.842 --> 42:29.050
>> WE TRIED TO LEARN JOHN'S

42:29.050 --> 42:29.842
STORY.

42:29.842 --> 42:30.508
WHO'S THAT GUY?

42:30.508 --> 42:31.467
>> IS THAT THE SAME GUY?

42:31.467 --> 42:33.675
>> TO HELP US FIND HIS DEEPEST

42:33.675 --> 42:34.425
MUSIC.

42:34.425 --> 42:36.050
>> I GOT MORE MUSCLES.

42:36.050 --> 42:38.133
>> BUT HOW DO YOU DO THIS FOR

42:38.133 --> 42:39.592
SOMEONE LIKE JOHN?

42:39.592 --> 42:42.008
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ABOUT THIS?

42:42.008 --> 42:44.383
WE WERE TOLD A FEW THINGS.

42:44.383 --> 42:47.258
HE PLAYED BASEBALL.

42:47.258 --> 42:48.508
>> OH!

42:48.508 --> 42:51.633
>> HE'D BEEN DRAFTED AND SERVED

42:51.633 --> 42:53.133
AT LOS ALAMOS.

43:02.842 --> 43:04.925
IT WAS THERE THAT THE ARMY

43:04.925 --> 43:06.508
GAVE HIM SHOTS FOR

43:06.508 --> 43:08.342
RADIATION POISONING --

43:08.342 --> 43:10.967
SHOTS THAT CAUSED ALL HIS HAIR

43:10.967 --> 43:12.258
TO FALL OUT.

43:12.258 --> 43:14.258
LASTLY, AFTER THE WAR, HE

43:14.258 --> 43:16.633
PERFORMED IN PHILADELPHIA UNDER

43:16.633 --> 43:18.883
THE STAGE NAME LARRY STEWART,

43:18.883 --> 43:22.592
BUT WE COULDN'T LEARN THIS FROM

43:22.592 --> 43:23.717
JOHN.

43:23.717 --> 43:25.675
THE SENSORY RECORD --

43:25.675 --> 43:28.258
THE MOVIE THAT PLAYED ONLY IN

43:28.258 --> 43:30.800
JOHN'S MIND, CALLED MEMORY --

43:30.800 --> 43:31.800
IS GONE.

43:31.800 --> 43:37.842
HIS LOVE, HIS DREAMS...

43:37.842 --> 43:41.842
GONE.

43:41.842 --> 43:45.383
WHO ARE WE WITHOUT OUR MEMORY?

43:49.592 --> 43:51.842
>> ? OH JOHNNY, OH JOHNNY ?

43:51.842 --> 43:53.842
>> IT'S "OH JOHNNY OH."

43:53.842 --> 43:56.383
HOW PERFECT! [ LAUGHS ]

43:58.383 --> 44:00.758
>> ? OH JOHNNY, OH JOHNNY ?

44:00.758 --> 44:03.092
? HOW YOU CAN LOVE ?

44:03.092 --> 44:05.758
? OH JOHNNY, OH JOHNNY ?

44:05.758 --> 44:07.175
? HEAVENS ABOVE ?

44:07.175 --> 44:09.925
? YOU MAKE MY SAD HEART JUMP

44:09.925 --> 44:11.175
WITH JOY ?

44:11.175 --> 44:14.008
? AND WHEN YOU'RE NEAR I JUST

44:14.008 --> 44:16.592
CAN'T SIT STILL A MINUTE ?

44:16.592 --> 44:17.467
? I'M SO ?

44:17.467 --> 44:19.550
? OH JOHNNY, OH JOHNNY ?

44:19.550 --> 44:21.800
? PLEASE TELL ME, DEAR ?

44:21.800 --> 44:26.050
? WHAT MAKES ME LOVE YOU SO ?

44:26.050 --> 44:27.342
? YOU'RE NOT HANDSOME,

44:27.342 --> 44:28.092
IT'S TRUE ?

44:28.092 --> 44:30.467
? BUT WHEN I LOOK AT YOU,

44:30.467 --> 44:32.217
I JUST, OH, JOHNNY ?

44:32.217 --> 44:33.758
? OH JOHNNY, OH ?

44:33.758 --> 44:35.467
? DA-DA-DA-DA-DA ??

44:35.467 --> 44:37.508
>> THERE WAS NO WAY WE COULD

44:37.508 --> 44:39.675
HAVE KNOWN THERE WAS THIS MUCH

44:39.675 --> 44:41.217
LIFE INSIDE OF JOHN.

44:41.217 --> 44:45.675
>> ? SOME ENCHANTED EVENING,

44:45.675 --> 44:51.383
YOU MAY SEE SOMEONE ?

44:51.383 --> 44:54.383
? YOU MAY SEE A STRANGER ??

44:54.383 --> 44:57.383
>> I WISH I HAD A VOICE LIKE

44:57.383 --> 44:58.175
HIM.

44:58.175 --> 45:00.383
>> FOR JOHNNY, GETTING HIS

45:00.383 --> 45:02.633
MUSIC, AND A LITTLE FOCUSED

45:02.633 --> 45:03.883
ATTENTION...

45:03.883 --> 45:06.092
>> YOU'RE QUITE THE SINGER.

45:06.092 --> 45:08.342
>> WAS ALL IT TOOK TO AWAKEN

45:08.342 --> 45:10.508
FEELINGS HE HADN'T FELT IN

45:10.508 --> 45:11.300
YEARS.

45:11.300 --> 45:14.133
>> I LOVE TO DO IT.

45:14.133 --> 45:16.092
>> Mike: WHEN DID YOU FIRST

45:16.092 --> 45:16.717
SING?

45:16.717 --> 45:18.758
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG, DID YOU

45:18.758 --> 45:19.383
SING?

45:19.383 --> 45:22.342
>> I DON'T KNOW.

45:22.342 --> 45:25.133
I'M JUST A SMALL GUY.

45:25.133 --> 45:26.550
>> YEAH?

45:26.550 --> 45:30.342
>> I'M CRYING.

45:30.342 --> 45:32.883
>> WHY? ARE YOU SAD?

45:32.883 --> 45:35.008
>> I DON'T KNOW.

45:35.008 --> 45:37.675
I LOVE EVERYBODY AROUND HERE.

45:37.675 --> 45:40.217
MY GANG -- THIS IS MY GANG.

45:40.217 --> 45:42.800
>> Woman: THIS IS YOUR GANG?

45:42.800 --> 45:43.425
YEAH?

45:43.425 --> 45:45.592
DOES IT MAKE YOU HAPPY TO SING

45:45.592 --> 45:46.342
FOR US?

45:46.342 --> 45:48.342
>> YEAH.

45:48.342 --> 45:50.092
>> Dan: HALF THE PEOPLE IN

45:50.092 --> 45:52.092
NURSING HOMES GET NO VISITORS,

45:52.092 --> 45:53.300
SO IT'S NOT LIKE

45:53.300 --> 45:54.592
FAMILY CAN DO IT.

45:54.592 --> 45:56.342
THE NURSING HOMES DON'T REALLY

45:56.342 --> 45:58.050
HAVE A READY BUDGET FOR THIS.

45:58.050 --> 46:00.508
THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT

46:00.508 --> 46:03.633
REIMBURSE FOR MUSIC, AND iPODS,

46:03.633 --> 46:06.342
SO IT REALLY NEEDS TO COME FROM

46:06.342 --> 46:07.467
SOMEWHERE.

46:07.467 --> 46:09.342
SO MY ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO MAKE

46:09.342 --> 46:10.842
THIS A STANDARD OF CARE

46:10.842 --> 46:12.675
IN ALL 16,000 NURSING HOMES IN

46:12.675 --> 46:13.633
THE COUNTRY.

46:13.633 --> 46:14.758
THAT'S THE GOAL.

46:14.758 --> 46:15.550
>> IT DEPENDS ON THE

46:15.550 --> 46:16.133
NURSING HOME.

46:16.133 --> 46:17.300
IT DEPENDS ON HOW PROACTIVE THE

46:17.300 --> 46:18.508
VOLUNTEER DEPARTMENT IS.

46:20.258 --> 46:22.258
>> Dan: IS THIS SOMETHING YOU'D

46:22.258 --> 46:24.092
WANT TO EXPLORE FOR YOUR OWN

46:24.092 --> 46:25.008
FACILITIES?

46:25.008 --> 46:26.133
>> WELL, I HAVE

46:26.133 --> 46:27.342
SEVERAL CONCERNS.

46:27.342 --> 46:28.592
>> THAT YOU GIVE IT TO 2 PEOPLE

46:28.592 --> 46:29.550
AND 10 PEOPLE ARE GOING

46:29.550 --> 46:30.800
TO WANT IT AND I'M NOT GOING TO

46:30.800 --> 46:31.883
BE ABLE TO GIVE IT TO THEM.

46:31.883 --> 46:32.758
>> FRANKLY, HOW

46:32.758 --> 46:33.800
IT'S ADMINISTERED.

46:33.800 --> 46:35.092
>> Woman: THIS IS A VERY

46:35.092 --> 46:35.758
BIG PLACE.

46:35.758 --> 46:37.175
WE HAVE 600 RESIDENTS HERE.

46:37.175 --> 46:39.300
>> COST IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT

46:39.300 --> 46:41.592
FACTOR THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER

46:41.592 --> 46:42.800
IN EVERY PROGRAM.

46:45.967 --> 46:47.550
>> Man: SO TELL ME, HOW CAN

46:47.550 --> 46:48.675
I HELP YOU TODAY?

46:48.675 --> 46:51.383
>> I'M LOOKING FOR A DONATION.

46:51.383 --> 46:53.675
>> SIR, ONE SECOND HERE.

46:53.675 --> 46:55.008
>> THE RESEARCH SHOWS IT,

46:55.008 --> 46:56.383
OUR EXPERIENCE SHOWS IT --

46:56.383 --> 46:57.592
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT

46:57.592 --> 46:59.758
MAINSTREAMING THE USE OF

46:59.758 --> 47:01.550
PERSONALIZED MUSIC,

47:01.550 --> 47:03.342
USING iPODS...

47:03.342 --> 47:06.300
I SPOKE TO THE SENIOR VICE

47:06.300 --> 47:09.758
PRESIDENT AND THEY -- THEY HAVE

47:09.758 --> 47:12.800
A NO CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY

47:12.800 --> 47:14.467
POLICY.

47:14.467 --> 47:16.133
THERE ARE 16,000 NURSING HOMES

47:16.133 --> 47:17.800
IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THE

47:17.800 --> 47:19.300
CHALLENGE IS GETTING IT OUT

47:19.300 --> 47:21.008
THERE, AND WE COULD REALLY USE

47:21.008 --> 47:21.717
YOUR HELP.

47:21.717 --> 47:24.133
>> Mike: SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR

47:24.133 --> 47:26.842
TALKED TO HIM ABUT YOUR PROJECT?

47:26.842 --> 47:28.092
>> NO, ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S,

47:28.092 --> 47:29.383
SUPPORT OF THE ALZHEIMER'S

47:29.383 --> 47:30.092
ASSOCIATION.

47:30.092 --> 47:33.758
SUPPORT FOR ALZHEIMER'S.

47:33.758 --> 47:34.800
>> SHE TALKED TO

47:34.800 --> 47:35.800
THE MAN HIMSELF.

47:35.800 --> 47:36.467
>> YEAH.

47:36.467 --> 47:37.633
>> AND HE SAID NO?

47:37.633 --> 47:38.258
>> YEAH.

47:38.258 --> 47:39.675
SO, WHAT LUCK AM I GOING

47:39.675 --> 47:41.633
TO HAVE?

47:52.467 --> 47:55.050
>> Thomas: HOW'S THE WORK GOING?

47:55.050 --> 47:57.092
>> Dan: IT'S A STRUGGLE.

47:57.092 --> 47:59.508
IT'S A STRUGGLE.

47:59.508 --> 48:01.758
>> Thomas: I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

48:01.758 --> 48:04.050
I AM ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO

48:04.050 --> 48:05.550
ACTUALLY KNOWS HOW

48:05.550 --> 48:07.133
YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS.

48:07.133 --> 48:09.550
BECAUSE A COUPLE OF DECADES AGO,

48:09.550 --> 48:12.008
I GOT REALLY CHARGED UP BY THIS

48:12.008 --> 48:13.967
IDEA THAT WE COULD BRING

48:13.967 --> 48:16.425
PLANTS AND ANIMALS AND CHILDREN

48:16.425 --> 48:18.508
INTO THE LIVES OF ELDERS.

48:18.508 --> 48:20.258
I HAD THE SAME KIND OF

48:20.258 --> 48:22.092
EXPERIENCES THAT YOU'VE

48:22.092 --> 48:24.008
DESCRIBED, WHERE I COULD

48:24.008 --> 48:25.758
SEE PEOPLE COME ALIVE.

48:25.758 --> 48:28.758
WE HAD THIS DREAM THAT WE'D

48:28.758 --> 48:31.842
JUST GO DOOR TO DOOR, BUT WE

48:31.842 --> 48:35.300
COULDN'T PENETRATE, SORT OF, THE

48:35.300 --> 48:38.008
FOG OF THE NURSING HOME.

48:38.008 --> 48:40.133
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS OUTSIDE OF

48:40.133 --> 48:42.175
CONVENTIONAL PRACTICE AND YOU

48:42.175 --> 48:43.883
HAVE TO -- AND IF YOU'RE

48:43.883 --> 48:45.842
GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL GOING

48:45.842 --> 48:47.967
FORWARD, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

48:47.967 --> 48:49.633
HOW BIG A BARRIER THAT IS.

48:55.467 --> 48:56.550
>> Man: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

48:56.550 --> 48:57.467
PLEASE FIND YOUR SEATS.

48:57.467 --> 49:00.133
>> Mike: WE WENT LOOKING FOR

49:00.133 --> 49:01.217
ANSWERS.

49:01.217 --> 49:03.383
IT TURNS OUT WE ARE NOT ALONE.

49:03.383 --> 49:05.425
THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO

49:05.425 --> 49:07.258
BELIEVE THERE'S SOMETHING

49:07.258 --> 49:09.300
FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG WITH THE

49:09.300 --> 49:11.008
AMERICAN NURSING HOME.

49:11.008 --> 49:13.092
>> Woman: I THINK WE ARE PART

49:13.092 --> 49:15.092
OF A MOVEMENT THAT IS MUCH,

49:15.092 --> 49:16.300
MUCH, BIGGER.

49:16.300 --> 49:17.592
I WANT TO WORK ON CULTURE

49:17.592 --> 49:18.133
CHANGE.

49:18.133 --> 49:19.425
I WANT TO SUPPORT CULTURE

49:19.425 --> 49:20.800
CHANGE AS A NATIONAL PRIORITY.

49:32.342 --> 49:33.342
>> Dan: HI, BONNIE.

49:33.342 --> 49:34.508
>> HI, DAN. WHAT'S UP?

49:34.508 --> 49:35.342
>> HOW ARE YOU?

49:35.342 --> 49:37.300
>> WE VALUE INDEPENDENCE AND

49:37.300 --> 49:38.883
HAVE THE HARDEST TIME,

49:38.883 --> 49:40.967
I BELIEVE, OF ANY COUNTRY WITH

49:40.967 --> 49:42.842
THE CONCEPT OF DEPENDENCE.

49:42.842 --> 49:45.967
AND SO, WHEREAS OTHER FOLKS HAVE

49:45.967 --> 49:48.467
INTEGRATED AGING, WE HAD

49:48.467 --> 49:51.258
A UNIQUE INTEREST IN SAYING,

49:51.258 --> 49:53.008
"OVER THERE -- I DON'T WANT TO

49:53.008 --> 49:54.258
SEE IT, I DON'T WANT

49:54.258 --> 49:55.383
TO KNOW ABOUT IT."

49:55.383 --> 49:56.758
>> Mike: WHY ARE WE CHANGING

49:56.758 --> 49:57.175
NOW?

49:57.175 --> 49:58.425
>> WHY ARE WE CHANGING NOW?

49:58.425 --> 50:00.133
BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING.

50:00.133 --> 50:01.883
BECAUSE IT'S DEHUMANIZING.

50:01.883 --> 50:03.717
AND I THINK, QUITE FRANKLY,

50:03.717 --> 50:05.800
I THINK BABY BOOMERS ARE SAYING,

50:05.800 --> 50:07.467
"THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

50:07.467 --> 50:09.342
THIS IS NOT HOW I WANT TO BE

50:09.342 --> 50:13.550
TREATED WHEN I GET OLDER."

50:13.550 --> 50:15.883
>> Mike: THIS WAS INSPIRING,

50:15.883 --> 50:16.758
BUT ARE

50:16.758 --> 50:18.758
WE REALLY INTERESTED IN

50:18.758 --> 50:21.217
CHANGING THE WAY AMERICA AGES?

50:21.217 --> 50:23.758
>> Thomas: MIGHT NOT REALIZE IT

50:23.758 --> 50:26.342
BUT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

50:26.342 --> 50:28.883
HAS ONLY 6,000 GERIATRICIANS IN

50:28.883 --> 50:31.217
A NATION OF 300 MILLION PEOPLE.

50:33.925 --> 50:36.883
EVEN WORSE, THAT NUMBER IS NOT

50:36.883 --> 50:39.508
GOING UP, IT'S GOING DOWN.

50:39.508 --> 50:43.633
>> THIS IS UNFORTUNATE TIMING,

50:43.633 --> 50:45.883
BECAUSE THE CHALLENGES WE'RE

50:45.883 --> 50:47.967
GOING TO HAVE TO FACE ARE

50:47.967 --> 50:48.883
GROWING.

50:48.883 --> 50:51.008
>> WE'RE FACING AN EPIDEMIC

50:51.008 --> 50:53.008
OF NEUROLOGIC DISEASES ON

50:53.008 --> 50:54.342
A GLOBAL SCALE.

50:54.342 --> 50:55.508
[ LAUGHTER ]

50:55.508 --> 50:57.050
A CHEERY THOUGHT.

50:57.050 --> 50:58.800
ON THIS MAP, EVERY COUNTRY

50:58.800 --> 51:00.675
THAT'S COLORED BLUE HAS MORE

51:00.675 --> 51:02.425
THAN 20% OF ITS POPULATION

51:02.425 --> 51:03.758
OVER THE AGE OF 65.

51:03.758 --> 51:05.717
THIS IS THE WORLD WE LIVE IN.

51:05.717 --> 51:07.550
AND THIS IS THE WORLD YOUR

51:07.550 --> 51:09.175
CHILDREN WILL LIVE IN.

51:09.175 --> 51:10.592
FOR 12,000 YEARS, THE

51:10.592 --> 51:12.342
DISTRIBUTION OF AGES IN THE

51:12.342 --> 51:13.717
HUMAN POPULATION HAS

51:13.717 --> 51:15.633
LOOKED LIKE A PYRAMID WITH THE

51:15.633 --> 51:16.675
OLDEST ON TOP.

51:16.675 --> 51:20.592
IT'S ALREADY FLATTENING OUT.

51:20.592 --> 51:23.300
BY 2050, IT'S GOING TO
