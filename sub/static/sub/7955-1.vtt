02:27.356 --> 02:31.191
We are now approaching
the heart of Crinos Nebula,

02:31.485 --> 02:34.102
where on the starboard viewing ports,

02:34.404 --> 02:36.987
to the right of the ship you can observe

02:37.282 --> 02:40.571
the spectacular blue giant, Galileus Major

02:41.703 --> 02:43.865
and Galileus Minor,

02:44.164 --> 02:47.157
a white dwarf caught in the gravitation

02:47.459 --> 02:49.826
field of its giant big brother.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.963
As we pass between these two suns,

02:54.257 --> 02:56.624
we are given a rare
opportunity to view one

02:56.927 --> 03:00.762
of the scenic and scientific
marvels of the known universe.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.969
This breathtaking effect is caused

03:04.267 --> 03:07.556
by the condensation of
nebular gases in the magnetic.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.224
Please do not be alarmed.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.018
It appears we have sustained damage

03:15.320 --> 03:18.279
from an unexpected
condensation of molten gases.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.781
You will now proceed to the
designated escape shuttle.

03:26.581 --> 03:27.867
Follow boarding instructions.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.624
The air-lock doors will seal automatically

03:30.919 --> 03:32.160
once you are safely aboard.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.023
Please be
sure to visit the newly

03:34.047 --> 03:35.583
refurbished Star-O-Rama lounge.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.790
The escape shuttles
have been programmed

03:50.814 --> 03:54.228
to seek out the nearest
E-type, or Earth-type planet.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.643
When your shuttle has
honed in on the planet

03:56.945 --> 03:58.982
most accommodating to the
needs of Earth-natives,

03:59.281 --> 04:03.241
you will be landed and
processed with full security.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.213
Do not be alarmed.

04:18.507 --> 04:19.827
You have been traveling suspended

04:19.968 --> 04:23.211
in the Merrill-Becker 3,000
Emergency Space Shuttle.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.426
For your comfort you have
been given a mild cryogenic

04:26.725 --> 04:29.138
which will wear off in couple of minutes.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.142
Do not panic.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.554
An emergency homing device
has been automatically

04:32.856 --> 04:35.974
triggered to ensure your safe retrieval.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.190
You will now remove your helmets.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.607
Please stay by your shuttle and
take a few moments to relax.

04:43.909 --> 04:47.869
You will be given further
instructions in a short time.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.120
I got a lot of
messages for you, Wolff.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.247
We got a transmission
from a guy on Omega Six.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.022
He's got eight tons of merilium scrap

06:17.127 --> 06:19.790
he wants you to pick
up as soon as you can.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.205
And the police called from the 42 sector.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.043
You've got 105 parking tickets.

06:24.342 --> 06:27.130
I think you should take care of that.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.886
And your ex-wife is looking for you.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.968
She hasn't gotten a check
from you in three months.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.067
Oh, and the administrator
of your housing unit

06:34.227 --> 06:35.830
says you're two months behind in your rent

06:35.854 --> 06:37.134
and you have five days to pay up

06:37.314 --> 06:38.434
or you're out in the street.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.189
Interrupt, interrupt.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.271
Space Station Copernica
to all units in vicinity

06:43.570 --> 06:47.189
of Terra Sector, Crinos
Nebula, Galileus System.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.358
All-space mayday Vi InterGal-Com-Net.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.286
Starliner X-ray 370 lost in solar.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.745
One shuttle, detached.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.045
Reward, 3,000 Megacredits.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.526
Chalmers!

07:25.570 --> 07:27.903
The communicator's out again.

07:29.783 --> 07:30.783
Get up!

07:34.955 --> 07:35.955
Get up.

07:35.997 --> 07:40.458
I'm entitled
to four hours downtime.

07:40.752 --> 07:44.041
Chalmers, the communicator is out again.

07:45.799 --> 07:49.383
That's because we need a new
auto-correlation spectometer.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.715
Not to mention a new
drive-systems regulator,

07:52.013 --> 07:53.504
a Freon activator and of course,

07:53.807 --> 07:56.925
a complete scan-systems overhaul.

07:57.227 --> 08:01.392
I'm still glad I bought
you the night shirt instead.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.022
Okay, what did you do to this?

08:03.316 --> 08:05.649
Emergency repair
procedure number one.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.025
You kicked it?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.312
Is that what they taught
you at Sector Control?

08:09.614 --> 08:10.149
Who listened?

08:10.448 --> 08:11.154
Anyway I thought you were gonna fix

08:11.449 --> 08:12.781
that spectometer last week?

08:13.076 --> 08:16.695
I keep starting but
you never let me finish.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.351
Okay, now let's see who needs

08:20.375 --> 08:23.368
a galaxy-hopping garbage man today.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.670
Right.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.750
Find me an all-space
mayday for Terra Sector,

08:28.049 --> 08:30.587
something about a shuttle rescue.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.712
Escape shuttle
with three female survivors

08:35.932 --> 08:38.140
now definitely known to
have successfully detached

08:38.434 --> 08:41.052
from Starliner X-ray 370 and is moving

08:41.354 --> 08:43.390
to landing on Planet Terra 11.

08:43.690 --> 08:44.970
The Intergalactic Consortium has

08:45.108 --> 08:47.816
announced a reward of 3,000 Megacredits.

08:48.111 --> 08:51.149
3,000 Megacredits is a lot of mmmm...

08:52.866 --> 08:53.866
Money.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.651
Yeah, too much
for a shuttle rescue.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.990
Are you looking for this?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.081
Terra 11.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.366
It rings a bell.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.581
Seems like we put a colony up

09:06.880 --> 09:10.373
there a long time ago, before the war.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.713
There was a plague or
something during the stalemate.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.719
Try it on the computer.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.392
Terra 11 Atmosphere E-Type.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.769
Exploration commenced 2013.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.057
Planet-wide outbreak of PSI Plague 2021.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.678
Interplanetary medical expedition

09:28.902 --> 09:31.110
assigned to plague control 2022.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.817
Leaders of expedition,
Patterson and McNabb quarreled.

09:34.115 --> 09:37.449
McNabb alias Overdog, assumed
dictatorship entire planet.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.827
Medical expedition vanished 2031.

09:40.121 --> 09:43.489
Current status, quarantine restricted.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.954
Quarantine restricted?

09:46.252 --> 09:48.790
Plague's been running rampant since 2031.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.752
Domestic food supply is probably infected.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.050
Sounds great.

09:53.176 --> 09:55.759
Activate the drive system, Chalmers.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.684
Grab the tracking module.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.201
The door won't open.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.532
It's the air-lock mechanism.

11:45.788 --> 11:46.824
Got 'em.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.489
Your course is 035.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.291
Distance, 20 klicks.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.250
Make it eat dirt, Chalmers.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.113
Wait a second.

12:22.408 --> 12:22.943
Something's wrong here.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.075
The shuttle seems to be moving.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.077
Your new course is 048.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.913
Somebody else must be on to it.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.208
Load and lock.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.181
Do you know we're
down to six star-clips?

12:33.336 --> 12:34.336
That's enough.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.167
We're not going to war, Chalmers.

13:40.278 --> 13:44.272
Well now, this is gonna
be easier than I thought.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.068
Barrier ahead!

13:49.370 --> 13:50.370
Barrier ahead!

13:51.581 --> 13:52.581
Hit the brakes!

13:52.874 --> 13:53.910
Hit the brakes!

13:56.127 --> 13:57.663
Trikers on the starboard!

13:57.962 --> 13:58.962
Over there!

13:59.172 --> 14:01.710
Overdog's Trikers on the starboard!

14:02.008 --> 14:04.716
It looks like we've got visitors.

14:07.722 --> 14:09.964
Go to the back, Winder, back!

14:13.644 --> 14:14.663
Winder, right side.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.723
The right side!

14:59.565 --> 15:02.729
Why can't anything be simple anymore?

15:09.784 --> 15:12.276
Chalmers, take out that cannon!

15:14.080 --> 15:16.242
Grandman Patterson's hit!

15:20.920 --> 15:21.920
Bloodstops!

15:27.218 --> 15:28.299
I'm going in.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.835
On whose side?

15:30.138 --> 15:31.595
My side, cover me.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.963
Works every time.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.534
They're outrolling!

18:47.752 --> 18:49.994
We can't make a bloodstop.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.955
He's blood-lost bad.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.137
McNabb!

19:00.014 --> 19:01.014
McNabb!

19:02.516 --> 19:04.508
You have done this to me!

19:06.604 --> 19:07.914
I think you have me confused...

19:07.938 --> 19:10.726
You and I were the only
doctors in this galaxy.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.187
And they sent us to fight the, fight the...

19:13.486 --> 19:15.166
To fight
the plagues, Grandman.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.528
You betrayed me, McNabb.

19:16.822 --> 19:17.822
Lie down, Grandman.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.276
He's just an outlander.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.110
What?

19:20.409 --> 19:20.944
An Earther.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.200
He's not Overdog McNabb.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.539
Where are the Earth girls?

19:27.833 --> 19:29.853
They were up-taken
by the Vultures, Grandman.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.709
Into the Zone.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.870
You must go there, Jarrett.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.755
You and Duster.

19:36.050 --> 19:39.009
Overdog McNabb's death we will gift you.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.303
Good, good.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.768
What do you want here, Earther?

19:49.063 --> 19:51.350
I don't mean to interfere with,

19:51.649 --> 19:53.732
but this Zone you were
speaking of, where is it?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.517
You have no claim there.

19:55.820 --> 19:58.403
The killing of the Overdog is ours.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.814
Fine, he's yours.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.482
But I need to find the girls.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.946
Well find them yourself, Earther.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.032
We have blood loss here.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.536
I'm sorry.

20:10.835 --> 20:11.835
But.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.190
Chalmers, get me a fix on those

20:15.214 --> 20:16.921
flying things, will ya?

20:19.135 --> 20:20.415
Be careful with him.

20:20.636 --> 20:21.843
Hold up his head.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.598
Chalmers?

20:43.284 --> 20:47.119
You were the best damn
model they ever put out.

23:58.938 --> 23:59.938
Hey!

24:04.443 --> 24:05.443
Hey!

24:06.403 --> 24:07.403
Hey!

24:07.696 --> 24:08.696
Stop it!

24:15.704 --> 24:17.696
What the hell are you?

24:17.998 --> 24:19.935
What do you think I am,
you skrotting Earth-bag?

24:19.959 --> 24:20.959
I'm a woman.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.246
An Earther.

24:22.544 --> 24:23.688
You'd better not skiz my home

24:23.712 --> 24:25.352
or I'll get my father to split your face.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.251
And I got brothers, too.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.505
If that's your father in
there, I got news for you.

24:30.678 --> 24:33.045
He's been dead for about ten years.

24:33.347 --> 24:34.347
Oh.

24:38.686 --> 24:41.679
Well this is my place,
anyway, so bone out.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.189
Whatever you say, Princess.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.179
Wait a minute, you got any food?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.798
'Cause if you got food, I can help you.

24:49.822 --> 24:50.528
I'm a tracker.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.623
I know everything about
this skrotting planet.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.183
Sorry, I'm booked up for the day.

24:57.121 --> 24:57.656
Hey, wait wait wait!

24:57.955 --> 24:59.742
I know where to buy clean Scav women.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.393
That's what you come for, isn't it?

25:01.417 --> 25:03.659
Or if you're selling, I've
got takers who'll buy.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.044
Or if you have the plague,
I can get you serum.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.125
My mother was a medical.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.424
I know about the new Earth-fraulies.

25:11.719 --> 25:12.880
They flew by here.

25:13.178 --> 25:13.713
They're like you.

25:14.013 --> 25:14.548
There was three of 'em.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.133
They weren't Scavs or Zoners.

25:16.432 --> 25:17.952
And they have these real fine clothes,

25:18.017 --> 25:20.760
and they're smooth all over.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.098
Where were they headed?

25:23.397 --> 25:25.517
So if you give me some
nibbles and take me wheeling,

25:25.566 --> 25:27.023
I'll track you to 'em.

25:27.317 --> 25:27.898
'Cause without me you ain't going

25:28.193 --> 25:30.150
to find 'em in a millonium.

25:30.446 --> 25:31.446
A millonium?

25:34.408 --> 25:35.408
Okay.

25:35.701 --> 25:36.908
Get in.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.159
I want clothes like
they got or else no deal

25:39.455 --> 25:41.697
and the food better be
Earth food or forget it.

25:41.999 --> 25:45.834
And you gotta, you'd better
be nice, you need me.

25:47.963 --> 25:48.963
Ow!

25:49.757 --> 25:50.757
That way!

25:51.925 --> 25:54.417
What's all this junk back here?

26:04.855 --> 26:06.695
I thought Earthers traveled
in style, you know?

26:06.815 --> 26:08.522
Everything real modern and all.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.433
You really drive an old wreck.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.069
This wreck is a collectors item.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.229
I made it myself.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.194
There's a Scav camp out that way.

26:17.493 --> 26:18.153
But Scavs are no problem.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.031
It's Zoners you got to watch out for.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.196
They're bad luck for you.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.159
They're badder for girls like me.

26:27.461 --> 26:28.461
They eat you.

26:31.090 --> 26:31.625
But they can't eat big,

26:31.924 --> 26:32.630
so they just razor off an arm or a leg,

26:33.759 --> 26:36.251
and keep going like that for days.

26:36.553 --> 26:37.760
Oh there's no thermal fever,

26:38.055 --> 26:40.297
'cause we're still away from the Zone.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.639
When we get down in, don't
drive close to the cliffs

26:42.768 --> 26:44.128
'cause they'll whack you straight.

26:44.186 --> 26:45.186
Are we gonna eat soon?

26:45.437 --> 26:46.437
No.

26:52.861 --> 26:55.695
You know, you're real lucky I'm here.

26:55.989 --> 26:58.356
'Cause if I wasn't, you'd
probably be spewered

26:58.659 --> 27:00.019
by the Chemist your first day out.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.285
Spewered?

27:01.370 --> 27:02.781
Where'd you learn to talk?

27:03.080 --> 27:04.446
I talk Earther, like you.

27:04.748 --> 27:05.748
Learned from my aunt.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.206
So you're real lucky I'm here.

27:07.501 --> 27:09.333
Real lucky, that's all I gotta say.

27:09.628 --> 27:13.588
If that's all you've
got to say, then I am lucky.

27:17.845 --> 27:21.179
Lieutenant, I hear our lovely Vultures.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.720
Can you tell if they have the girls?

27:25.018 --> 27:27.055
Can you see them, yet?

27:27.354 --> 27:28.470
Are they pretty?

27:30.357 --> 27:34.567
I do hope they're young
and soft, but not fat.

27:34.862 --> 27:37.275
Young girls are so much nicer to touch.

27:38.949 --> 27:41.282
Especially if they have no scars.

27:41.577 --> 27:43.785
Overdog is put off by scars.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.582
Can you see if they have any scars?

28:02.472 --> 28:03.713
Let go of me!

28:06.768 --> 28:09.101
Are they missing any limbs?

28:10.147 --> 28:13.311
I hate it when they have missing limbs.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.733
What's for food?

28:24.036 --> 28:26.153
Hot dogs.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.242
Don't fix none for me.

28:30.292 --> 28:32.079
I thought you were
starving for Earth food.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.709
I don't eat no dogs.

28:34.004 --> 28:35.711
Scavs eat dogs.

28:36.006 --> 28:38.123
I thought Earthers were
supposed to eat good.

28:38.425 --> 28:40.065
It isn't a dog, they just call it that.

28:40.344 --> 28:41.344
How come?

28:44.097 --> 28:46.714
Look, if you want to eat, eat.

28:47.017 --> 28:49.475
If you don't want to eat, don't.

28:57.611 --> 29:01.696
You really think you're
some kind of tough, don't you?

29:02.658 --> 29:03.819
Tough enough.

29:04.868 --> 29:08.828
I know some people who'd
eat you for breakfast.

29:19.383 --> 29:20.669
I never said I wouldn't eat dog.

29:20.968 --> 29:23.426
I said I don't eat it that much.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.188
What's that?

29:36.024 --> 29:38.391
A sleeping bag.

29:38.694 --> 29:40.310
You mean, we just crawl in?

29:40.612 --> 29:42.444
Sleep in that bag thing?

29:42.739 --> 29:44.275
Not we, me.

29:45.492 --> 29:46.903
What about me?

29:47.202 --> 29:47.737
What about you?

29:48.036 --> 29:49.036
Where do I sleep?

29:49.079 --> 29:50.695
That's your problem.

29:51.873 --> 29:55.082
You know, there's room for
two in there if they was cozy.

29:55.377 --> 29:57.494
Yeah, well, we ain't cozy.

30:07.556 --> 30:08.556
Goodnight.

30:24.239 --> 30:28.324
Well if he don't like
women, that's his problem.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.463
They are pretty.

30:50.766 --> 30:53.474
Much better than the last ones.

30:53.769 --> 30:56.386
Overdog is going to be so pleased.

30:57.481 --> 30:59.361
I demand that you
transmit rescue co-ordinates

30:59.649 --> 31:00.889
to the nearest Earth Star Base.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.503
Under Galactic Law, you can't hold us...

31:02.527 --> 31:03.527
Silence.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.984
Overdog is our gracious
lord and protector.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.320
Above all laws but his own.

31:11.578 --> 31:14.286
He and I have mined
and scoured this planet

31:14.581 --> 31:16.823
of all its riches just for the use

31:17.125 --> 31:19.242
and pleasure of our friends.

31:20.629 --> 31:23.121
You will be friends, won't you?

31:24.674 --> 31:27.667
Please, we just want to go home.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.797
You will feel at home here.

31:33.100 --> 31:37.060
I promise you, my dear,
after a little mood enhancer.

31:44.277 --> 31:45.939
No, no, no!

32:14.516 --> 32:16.473
What's your problem?

32:16.768 --> 32:17.768
I was cold, okay?

32:18.061 --> 32:19.097
Is that so bad?

32:29.906 --> 32:31.272
What are you doing?

32:31.575 --> 32:32.691
Let me down!

32:32.993 --> 32:33.993
Let go of me!

32:35.162 --> 32:36.162
Let go of me!

32:44.254 --> 32:46.837
Why did you have to go and
get my clothes all wet for?

32:47.132 --> 32:48.998
Because your clothes
need it and so do you.

32:49.301 --> 32:50.903
Oh yeah, you probably want
to stand there and watch

32:50.927 --> 32:53.340
and get all excited when
I dry out my stuff, right?

32:55.765 --> 32:57.051
Don't flatter yourself, kid.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.350
Scum-eater!

33:00.145 --> 33:04.230
You miserable, little,
filthy, rat-ass Scavenger.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.480
I'm not a Scav, I'm an Earth girl!

33:08.778 --> 33:09.313
Good.

33:09.613 --> 33:12.026
Maybe now you're gonna smell like one.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.190
You scum, let go of me!

33:16.661 --> 33:17.661
No!

33:24.085 --> 33:25.166
Let go of me!

33:31.510 --> 33:33.342
Behind the other ear.

33:38.642 --> 33:39.642
Okay, rinse.

33:48.610 --> 33:49.610
Once more.

33:55.408 --> 33:56.408
Turn around.

34:02.457 --> 34:03.457
Turn around.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.498
Why, you're nothing but a baby.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.235
Maybe you don't think I'm nothing,

34:13.260 --> 34:15.172
but there's plenty of
people who think different

34:15.469 --> 34:17.302
and they're looking for me even.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.437
So I don't have to go
around beggin' no Earthie

34:19.683 --> 34:22.016
for no warm place to
snooze or nothing to eat.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.733
What the hell is that?

34:39.953 --> 34:43.321
Oh it's probably just
the Chemist hauling drugs.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.239
He won't come in here.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.371
Any more predictions?

34:53.675 --> 34:54.755
Okay, I was wrong.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.051
Get down.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.534
Grab the stuff and get in the scrambler.

35:40.347 --> 35:41.347
Hi.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.308
How are ya?

36:25.350 --> 36:26.682
Son of a bitch!

36:34.067 --> 36:35.067
Wolff!

36:40.740 --> 36:42.231
All right, Wolff, get up!

36:42.534 --> 36:43.650
Come on, get up!

36:44.786 --> 36:46.243
It's the oldest trick in the book.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.932
I didn't fall for it
when we were in training,

36:47.956 --> 36:49.993
and I'm sure not gonna fall for it now.

36:50.291 --> 36:51.291
So, get up!

36:57.257 --> 36:58.257
Hey, hey.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.261
Hey, Wolff?

37:06.558 --> 37:08.470
You're getting soft, Washington.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.350
Must be past your prime.

37:10.645 --> 37:11.852
At least I had a prime.

37:12.147 --> 37:13.787
You're still waiting for yours to arrive.

37:14.023 --> 37:17.061
And you're getting nasty
in your old age, too.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.522
Must be all those years in the service.

37:19.821 --> 37:21.528
The service ain't so bad.

37:21.823 --> 37:24.031
Since you left, they made me Sector Chief.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.325
Imagine that.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.697
Only 14 years of taking orders

37:27.996 --> 37:31.205
and already you're Chief of Terra Sector.

37:32.959 --> 37:35.121
In the garbage heap of the universe.

37:35.420 --> 37:35.910
Just looking at you, Wolff,

37:36.212 --> 37:39.455
I see you're doin' real good for yourself.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.795
I'm glad you noticed.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.427
You know, most people like
to stick with something.

37:45.722 --> 37:48.590
But you, you're like
fly shit on the window.

37:48.892 --> 37:51.509
The first little breeze
that blows and you're gone.

37:51.811 --> 37:52.811
That's good.

37:52.854 --> 37:55.562
You're becoming a real philosopher.

37:58.693 --> 37:59.934
Just look at it!

38:00.236 --> 38:01.772
Look at what you did!

38:03.865 --> 38:04.865
It's ruined!

38:12.165 --> 38:16.000
Yeah, well, okay, you
get me towed out of here,

38:17.670 --> 38:21.084
and between you and me and
these machines, we got it made.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.965
Where'd you get
this overgrown snowplow?

38:24.260 --> 38:24.841
I borrowed it.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.503
Off some gents down the road.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.206
Look Wolff, you're here after those

38:29.349 --> 38:30.549
three Earth girls, same as me.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.641
The only difference it's my job.

38:32.936 --> 38:33.954
As Sector Chief, I could put you

38:33.978 --> 38:35.844
in life-freeze for being here.

38:36.147 --> 38:36.728
But what the hell.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.697
You help me out, I'll
make it worth your while.

38:39.776 --> 38:43.269
You'll probably come out of
this with at least 500 Megs.

38:43.571 --> 38:44.812
500 Megs?

38:45.114 --> 38:46.114
All for me?

38:46.950 --> 38:48.157
What are friends for?

38:48.451 --> 38:49.451
Forget it, Chromedome.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.360
We don't need your help.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.463
So why don't you just
dig a hole and crawl in?

38:53.748 --> 38:55.410
Come on, Jack, let's hit the trail.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.165
Where'd you buy the Scav?

38:57.460 --> 38:59.622
I'm not a Scav and I'm not a buy!

38:59.921 --> 39:01.002
I'm an Earther!

39:01.297 --> 39:02.913
Hey, this guy's just dead weight.

39:03.216 --> 39:04.568
We can be there in a couple of days

39:04.592 --> 39:06.879
and won't have to split
the reward with nobody.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.636
Okay, I'll cut you in for 750.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.052
And that's more than you're worth.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.351
750?

39:16.729 --> 39:18.595
Let me think about it.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.855
You'll be here, won't you?

39:21.818 --> 39:24.231
Look, at least leave my gun?

39:26.197 --> 39:27.197
Oh, I'm sorry.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.572
I totally forgot.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.239
You're gonna need a partner, Wolff.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.704
He's already got a partner.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.873
Have a nice swim.

40:15.622 --> 40:17.488
What are you looking at?

40:17.790 --> 40:21.079
I'm not just looking,
I'm brainworking you.

40:21.377 --> 40:22.521
Anybody smart would have melted

40:22.545 --> 40:24.662
that black Scav and cleaned him bare

40:24.964 --> 40:26.483
and then maybe we could've taken his truck

40:26.507 --> 40:29.875
and split it down the
middle, just like the reward.

40:30.178 --> 40:32.170
About this partnership.

40:32.472 --> 40:33.963
What about it?

40:34.265 --> 40:35.722
Partners we ain't.

40:36.893 --> 40:40.978
You track me to the Zone, I
give you food and that's it.

40:43.650 --> 40:47.314
I can handle the
brainworks for both of us.

41:15.515 --> 41:16.515
Holy shit!

41:19.310 --> 41:21.051
Jump a lizard, Scav.

41:24.399 --> 41:26.231
This has to be the Zone.

41:26.526 --> 41:27.526
No, not yet.

41:30.613 --> 41:32.570
Then what are you looking so scared for?

41:32.865 --> 41:34.072
I'm not scared!

41:36.494 --> 41:39.407
It's just that we're riding
real close to the Chemist.

41:39.706 --> 41:43.325
I've been hiding from
him forever in my caves.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.040
You better hurry up and
find us safe and sound.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.796
Sleep-light's fallin' real fast.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.106
Smells like somebody died in here.

42:16.617 --> 42:18.199
They probably did.

42:27.503 --> 42:28.503
Wait here.

42:44.645 --> 42:47.058
Looks okay, bring up the gear.

43:18.137 --> 43:18.797
Wolff?

43:19.097 --> 43:20.097
Huh?

43:20.264 --> 43:21.971
Why do they call you Wolff?

43:22.266 --> 43:23.677
That's my name.

43:23.976 --> 43:25.433
Good name for you.

43:26.562 --> 43:29.976
I mean, you don't care about my name, huh?

43:30.942 --> 43:32.544
You know, I can see
why you got no friends.

43:32.568 --> 43:33.729
You don't like nothin'.

43:34.028 --> 43:35.214
Haven't you ever liked anything?

43:35.238 --> 43:36.774
Like a dog or a goat?

43:37.865 --> 43:39.026
My name's Niki.

43:41.077 --> 43:42.317
I don't know about a last name.

43:42.495 --> 43:44.236
But, sometimes they
call me Niki the Twister

43:44.539 --> 43:46.781
'cause I can wriggle into little places.

43:47.083 --> 43:49.120
Yeah, I've noticed.

43:49.418 --> 43:52.331
Surprised you ain't making
me sleep someplace else.

43:52.630 --> 43:54.963
I'd probably miss your
sparkling conversation.

43:55.258 --> 43:56.258
Really?

44:08.062 --> 44:09.062
What was that?

44:11.440 --> 44:13.523
Nothing, go to sleep.

44:13.818 --> 44:15.254
No, I'm telling you
Wolff, I heard something.

44:15.278 --> 44:15.893
And I'm telling you, there's...

45:16.881 --> 45:17.983
You're behind me, right?

45:18.007 --> 45:19.007
Yeah, keep going.

45:19.050 --> 45:22.964
Yeah, but there's somethin'

45:38.152 --> 45:39.359
What now?

45:39.654 --> 45:40.189
I'm thinking.

45:40.488 --> 45:41.854
Well think a little faster.

45:42.156 --> 45:43.156
This way.

45:55.044 --> 45:56.330
Okay, do me a favor.

45:56.629 --> 45:58.962
Grab onto that cable and just jump, okay?

45:59.257 --> 45:59.872
Jump?

46:00.174 --> 46:01.460
Are you kidding me?

46:01.759 --> 46:03.876
I'll take my chances with that bat things.

46:04.178 --> 46:05.178
Oh, maybe not.

46:05.263 --> 46:08.051
Do me a favor and just jump, okay?

46:09.016 --> 46:10.177
I can't move.

46:11.978 --> 46:15.471
Here, I'll make it easy for you.

46:15.773 --> 46:16.773
Okay?

46:52.935 --> 46:54.426
So long, suckers!

47:03.571 --> 47:05.278
Great Overdog,

47:05.573 --> 47:10.193
how can I prepare you for
the treat you have in store?

47:10.494 --> 47:12.486
What is it this time, Chemist?

47:12.788 --> 47:16.498
Three times beauty, youth, and energy.

47:16.792 --> 47:19.330
What gifts for the great Overdog.

47:20.838 --> 47:22.204
Gifts?

47:22.506 --> 47:23.506
What gifts?

47:24.383 --> 47:26.921
They are my basic needs.

47:27.219 --> 47:29.176
And they will fulfill your needs

47:29.472 --> 47:31.839
much better than the last ones.

47:33.893 --> 47:35.805
Earth girls?

47:41.942 --> 47:44.605
You are pleased, Your Radiance?

47:46.364 --> 47:49.778
You'll know when I'm not pleased.

47:50.076 --> 47:51.076
Out!

47:51.744 --> 47:52.951
Shall I wait outside?

47:53.245 --> 47:54.245
Out!

47:55.915 --> 47:57.998
Bring them to me.

48:00.503 --> 48:01.503
Closer!

48:04.965 --> 48:06.376
That one!

48:06.675 --> 48:08.792
The one in the center.

48:09.095 --> 48:10.095
Undress her.

48:12.431 --> 48:13.431
Slowly!

48:30.449 --> 48:31.449
Yes.

48:40.084 --> 48:41.084
Yes.

49:02.773 --> 49:04.126
In case I forgot to tell you,

49:04.150 --> 49:06.016
this thing doesn't float.

49:06.986 --> 49:07.692
There's shallows in here.

49:07.987 --> 49:10.104
You just gotta look for 'em.

49:12.116 --> 49:13.277
I'll track you.

49:23.836 --> 49:25.919
Shallows are on that side.

49:29.258 --> 49:30.624
Second bath in two days.

49:30.926 --> 49:32.883
Ought to do me for the next year.

49:37.266 --> 49:38.266
Niki?

49:42.730 --> 49:43.730
Niki?

49:47.401 --> 49:48.401
Niki?

50:05.336 --> 50:06.952
Good breeding man.

50:07.254 --> 50:09.166
I'll bet breeding
with us would kill him.

50:09.465 --> 50:11.673
I'll take that bet.

50:11.967 --> 50:15.586
Get your hands off me,
you sleazy slime-bag!

51:01.934 --> 51:02.594
Look!

51:02.893 --> 51:05.055
I love this planet.

51:05.354 --> 51:06.390
Get away from here!

51:06.689 --> 51:07.349
Eat him!

51:07.648 --> 51:08.183
No, get him!

51:08.482 --> 51:09.482
He's bigger!

51:40.931 --> 51:41.591
What about me?

51:41.890 --> 51:42.890
Sorry, kid.

51:52.943 --> 51:54.275
Oh, God, come on!

51:55.738 --> 51:57.400
Up there, the tunnel.

52:33.651 --> 52:35.142
I love your planet.

52:54.588 --> 52:56.548
I'm curious, does your
guided tour include getting

52:56.632 --> 52:58.965
me back to my scrambler
without doing battle

52:59.259 --> 53:01.251
with a bunch of Amazons and dragons?

53:01.553 --> 53:05.513
You always gotta use those
scazzy words, don't you?

53:08.185 --> 53:11.349
You think I don't know which way to go?

53:13.190 --> 53:15.398
I'll show you which way to go.

53:15.693 --> 53:18.401
With no swimming women or dragmens.

53:24.785 --> 53:25.785
Come on!

53:43.887 --> 53:48.302
Water, water everywhere,
and not a drop to drink.

53:48.600 --> 53:49.841
What's that?

53:50.144 --> 53:51.225
It's a poem.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.227
The first poem you learn in high school.

53:53.522 --> 53:54.683
What's high school?

53:54.982 --> 53:56.062
It's where you should be.

53:56.275 --> 53:57.686
It's where you learn things.

53:57.985 --> 53:59.146
I don't have to go no place

53:59.445 --> 54:02.483
to brainwork that that stuff's poison.

54:02.781 --> 54:04.738
That's what I just said.

55:35.916 --> 55:37.327
You got any water?

55:41.129 --> 55:42.245
What say?

55:42.548 --> 55:44.748
I see your mouth moving, I
can't hear a word you sayin'.

55:44.883 --> 55:47.921
I went swimming yesterday,
diving for my gun.

55:48.220 --> 55:50.007
I got all this water in my ear.

55:50.305 --> 55:51.671
Cut the shit, Washington.

55:51.974 --> 55:53.010
She needs help.

55:54.977 --> 55:56.889
Wolff and his partner.

55:58.397 --> 56:01.606
Well, I sure am happy to
run into you like this.

56:01.900 --> 56:03.660
Well after I got my
wheels unstuck I followed

56:03.819 --> 56:05.099
your tracks through that tunnel,

56:05.237 --> 56:06.773
found your vehicle towed it back out,

56:07.072 --> 56:09.735
and drove out all the way
down here looking for you.

56:10.033 --> 56:11.261
So much time had passed
I thought you'd changed

56:11.285 --> 56:13.005
your mind about the
rescue and I don't know,

56:13.078 --> 56:14.198
gotten married or something.

56:14.413 --> 56:15.904
Washington, give her some water.

56:16.206 --> 56:17.206
Water, yeah.

56:29.845 --> 56:30.845
Mm, ah, good.

56:33.724 --> 56:34.724
Good.

56:38.604 --> 56:41.017
Okay, you get what you want.

56:42.065 --> 56:43.897
Just give me the water.

56:54.620 --> 56:56.953
Okay Wolff, here's the deal.

56:57.247 --> 56:58.783
You help me go in and get the girls,

56:59.082 --> 57:01.074
I'll give you 750 Megacredits.

57:01.376 --> 57:02.854
You fly us all out of here afterwards,

57:02.878 --> 57:04.369
I throw in another couple hundred.

57:04.671 --> 57:06.333
That's almost 1,000 Megacredits.

57:06.632 --> 57:08.123
And I'm only being this generous,

57:08.425 --> 57:09.961
because of our former friendship.

57:10.260 --> 57:11.501
What former friendship?

57:11.803 --> 57:12.338
Look, Wolff...

57:12.638 --> 57:14.220
Why would you need me to fly

57:14.514 --> 57:16.801
you out of here, Sector Chief?

57:18.769 --> 57:21.933
I hit a particle storm,
sustained engine damage.

57:22.230 --> 57:25.018
I had some problems landing my ship.

57:28.612 --> 57:30.194
It could happen to anybody.

57:30.489 --> 57:31.489
Look the point is,

57:31.657 --> 57:34.240
I'm giving you a chance
to make some extra money.

57:34.534 --> 57:38.027
You need my ship for transportation,

57:38.330 --> 57:41.118
or else you're stuck here, aren't you?

57:41.416 --> 57:43.703
The deal is 50-50, or nothing.

57:45.128 --> 57:48.292
That skrotter ain't worth 50 fifties.

57:49.299 --> 57:50.585
That's true.

57:50.884 --> 57:53.342
Wolff, you're a goddamn thief.

57:59.017 --> 58:01.054
Boy, when I get my 50 percent,

58:01.353 --> 58:02.793
I'm gonna get over to Kuralla Three,

58:02.854 --> 58:05.141
order me one of them custom androids.

58:05.440 --> 58:06.851
I mean, a real hot one.

58:07.150 --> 58:09.608
In fact, I'm getting two, twins.

58:10.696 --> 58:12.187
Hey, Wolff, what about you?

58:12.489 --> 58:13.758
Oh, I don't know, maybe I'll...

58:13.782 --> 58:16.149
I haven't figured out what
I'll do with my half yet.

58:16.451 --> 58:17.737
Your half?

58:18.036 --> 58:20.323
Hey, what's she talking about?

58:22.082 --> 58:23.243
Oh, I get it.

58:24.376 --> 58:25.576
I tracked you two to the Zone,

58:25.794 --> 58:27.230
and then you pick up those Earth-fraulies

58:27.254 --> 58:29.792
and then it's so long, Niki.

58:30.090 --> 58:31.890
Oh, my big thrill is I
get to look up and wave

58:31.967 --> 58:33.754
while you two go shottin' across the sky.

58:34.052 --> 58:35.612
Well thank you, it's been a real charge

58:35.679 --> 58:39.013
in my life just hanging
around for a couple days.

58:39.307 --> 58:40.423
Wait a minute.

58:41.393 --> 58:42.975
Wait a minute.

58:43.270 --> 58:46.263
If you think our deal
is for me to baby-sit

58:46.565 --> 58:48.978
you for the next 200
years, you're dreamin'.

58:49.276 --> 58:53.236
I don't remember us saying
anything about adoption.

59:03.623 --> 59:05.535
Hey, don't let him get to you.

59:05.834 --> 59:07.917
Ah, he's just a space tramp.

59:08.211 --> 59:09.577
A loner.

59:09.880 --> 59:12.748
I mean, most of us like to
have some time on our own,

59:13.050 --> 59:16.464
but a guy like Wolff, he
don't know nothing else.

59:16.762 --> 59:19.800
Yeah, but us loners
gotta stick together.

59:20.098 --> 59:21.098
Maybe so.

59:24.770 --> 59:25.770
Partner.

59:35.989 --> 59:36.989
Look.

59:38.992 --> 59:42.576
If after we finish this,
you want a lift...

59:46.333 --> 59:50.418
To another planet or
something, just say so, okay?

59:51.421 --> 59:54.038
Yeah, well maybe I gotta
think about it first.

59:54.341 --> 59:57.379
Hey, something's coming.

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:10.729
What do those skrot-bags want?

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:27.330
This is the only safe
down place before the Zone.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:28.624
Wash!

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.837
You tracked well, Earther.

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:40.136
You know these two?

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:43.588
Yeah, we met on a train.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:46.007
You're welcome to sleep here.

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:48.221
We don't need your permission, Earther.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.727
We do as we want.

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.807
Do you find them as charming as I do?

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:55.816
Let's kill 'em to be on the safe side.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:56.646
Nah, it's okay.

01:00:56.945 --> 01:00:58.982
They haven't done anything, yet.

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:01.864
You Zone-pointed?

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:03.445
For the Graveyard.

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:06.076
With what brainworking?

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:07.828
Death for Overdog!

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:11.161
Wolff, these boys are sincere.

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:12.659
They're just gonna frag us up.

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:15.039
Let's blast 'em now, and
get to know 'em later.

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.338
Just relax.

01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:17.997
Maybe we can work together.

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:00.539
Why, they're children.

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:02.718
Aren't they?

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.760
The Overdog did this, and the Chemist,

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:10.675
with their germ-works.

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:15.145
To children?

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:19.309
This whole planet gives me the creeps.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:34.411
Let's get the hell out of here!

01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:27.384
What the hell are you waiting for?

01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:29.215
The damn blade's gone, Wolff.

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:31.834
And those two hotheads are
gonna go into the Zone blasting.

01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:33.452
By the time we roll up,
every guard in the place

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.836
gonna be armed and waiting for us.

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:36.706
Well if you can get
this piece of junk fixed,

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:37.971
we might be able to catch up.

01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:38.808
In the old days,

01:03:39.107 --> 01:03:40.960
you would have blasted
them without even blinking.

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:41.984
You're losing your edge.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:43.479
I am not losing my edge.

01:03:43.778 --> 01:03:46.065
I'm just trying to do things
a little smarter these days.

01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:47.364
Smarter?

01:03:47.407 --> 01:03:49.527
Being led by a Scav girl,
who's barely out of diapers?

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:52.151
I'm not a Scav girl, and
I'm not out of my diapers.

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:53.454
Stop it!

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:58.292
Let's get this heap fixed

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.369
and then try to figure out
how to hit the Graveyard.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.378
Which none of us has ever seen.

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:04.834
I've seen it.

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:06.133
From far away.

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:38.285
See, I told you I'd track you.

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:39.623
And no guards around here.

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:40.624
You, quiet!

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:42.205
And stay in there!

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.746
Serum papers.

01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:24.622
Serum papers?

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:27.339
Oh.

01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:29.049
In my boot.

01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:21.134
Are you ready?

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:24.311
Let the games begin!

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:26.725
Now!

01:06:27.025 --> 01:06:28.937
Impressive looking son of a bitch!

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:29.895
Whatever it is.

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:33.814
How much of
him do you think is him?

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:02.012
Decimator, Decimator, Decimator!

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:19.108
Yes!

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:21.777
They have sure come a long
way from Monday Night Football.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.080
Fool!

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:25.749
I want death!

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:28.293
Wash!

01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:33.737
They're what we came for all right.

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:34.418
They sure don't fit in with

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.037
the rest of the scum around here.

01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:38.548
Their clothes are okay,
but they're not so hot.

01:07:38.846 --> 01:07:40.007
Do you want more?

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:01.617
It's us, you half-brain.

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:07.747
Another!

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.312
I see you're doing
real good for yourself.

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:11.543
So what happened?

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:14.000
We brainworked to attack the slave pens,

01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:15.299
and free the captives.

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:16.750
Then with the guards up-taken,

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:18.133
we could move for Overdog.

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:19.428
But it was wrong-done.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:20.720
I told you, Wolff.

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:22.254
Where's your brother?

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:25.095
He was put into the slave pens.

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:28.055
I could not stop it.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:29.595
So I fled.

01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:31.263
Release another!

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:37.435
Hitting the slave pens
might be the way to go.

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:39.658
I got some great fireworks,
could draw a crowd.

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:41.385
Alright, when you
start your celebration,

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:43.049
I'll grab 'em and we'll meet at the wall.

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:44.328
Let's go.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:49.911
Decimator, Decimator, Decimator!

01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:58.175
I'll come with you.

01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:00.501
No, you stay here with the Scrambler.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:01.803
Okay, I'll guard.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:03.299
Don't guard, just get in here.

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:04.133
Well I can signal if any

01:09:04.432 --> 01:09:05.908
of the scum-eaters are coming after you.

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:07.515
Don't guard, don't signal.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.569
Just get in here and
wait for me, understand?

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:10.932
Why can't I come with you?

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:13.939
Because it's dangerous and
I don't want you to get hurt.

01:09:14.233 --> 01:09:15.233
Really?

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:19.564
Prisoner for the slave pen.

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:21.651
Okay, bring him on in.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:24.901
Hey, get back.

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:27.991
You know, everybody else gets to go throw

01:09:28.288 --> 01:09:30.076
the prisoners into the Death Maze.

01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:31.375
Do I?

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:32.662
No!

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:36.920
I gotta hang around here,
and guard these damn slaves.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:40.962
Come on, get in here.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:42.962
Come on, everyone, come on.

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:44.298
Let's go, move!

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:03.696
Got any joy smoke on you?

01:10:03.991 --> 01:10:05.857
It's been a long dry day.

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:11.498
Any candy?

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:13.916
Dillies? Blowups? Snappers?

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.210
No?

01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:17.202
Okay well, I'll just go someplace else.

01:10:17.505 --> 01:10:18.996
You can ask the Chemist.

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:20.298
No, no, wait a minute.

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:20.998
You got me mixed up!

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.666
I'm a Scav, really.

01:11:03.968 --> 01:11:06.631
Pretty good today, huh?

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:07.948
You two, get out of
here, get out of here!

01:11:07.972 --> 01:11:08.972
Let's go!

01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:12.925
Hey, what are you doing?

01:11:13.227 --> 01:11:16.391
Planting a bomb, you moron,
what does it look like?

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:20.936
More explosions!

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:24.111
Guards, to the slave pens!

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.857
Hold this for me, will ya?

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.246
Will you please shut up!

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:44.960
I am trying to rescue you.

01:11:45.259 --> 01:11:46.259
Get back!

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:52.305
Hey, you two bleeders
get back to the wall

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.720
and take care of yourselves.

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:55.225
I'm gonna find me some Wolff.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.636
You imbeciles!

01:11:57.563 --> 01:12:00.180
You crawling mess of refuse.

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:03.942
How could you all fail at the same time?

01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:07.856
Overdog, I have a
consolation prize for you.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:11.867
She also is an Earther.

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:15.529
But, she has much more
fire than those pale,

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:17.619
poor creatures who fled.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:22.669
Get your paws off me,
you ugly bag of slime.

01:12:22.964 --> 01:12:23.964
You see?

01:12:36.227 --> 01:12:37.227
I like her.

01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:41.396
I like her for the Maze.

01:12:50.157 --> 01:12:51.238
Into the Maze.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:09.966
Let me out of this cage, I'm no animal!

01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:12.298
No, you're a lovely human

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:16.385
and you deserve to know the rules.

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:19.392
If you make it through
this game, you'll go free.

01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:20.894
But if you don't...

01:13:21.188 --> 01:13:23.180
Oh yeah, I'm worm-food, right?

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:14.129
That little pain in the ass!

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:33.519
Wolff!

01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:35.215
Take the girls, I'm going down there.

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:36.717
Hey hey, it's impossible down there.

01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:37.447
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:15:37.742 --> 01:15:38.760
We're talking about 3,000 Megs.

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:40.400
I don't give a shit.

01:15:49.336 --> 01:15:50.998
I'm not going to leave her like this.

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:52.913
Get your hands off me.

01:15:57.511 --> 01:16:00.219
You're not gonna make
it this time, buddy.

01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:14.665
Congratulations.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:17.380
You made it through.

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:29.555
You have a very enviable life force.

01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:32.437
A life force you're
going to share with me.

01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:36.270
But you said if I made
it through, I'm free.

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:37.685
I lied.

01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:40.278
Nobody goes free.

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:44.657
Chemist!

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:46.739
Prepare the fusion tube!

01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:01.134
Yes!

01:18:02.553 --> 01:18:05.512
I think we're going to be very close.

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:06.806
Sure.

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:08.385
We can be friends.

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:09.720
Just let me go.

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.182
No, you don't understand.

01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:17.391
I'm very old and I need you.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:22.358
I need your vitality.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:24.532
Okay, fine.

01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:26.784
You can have it.

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:28.030
Just let me go.

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:33.074
Getting tired, little one?

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:34.375
Of course you are.

01:18:34.418 --> 01:18:35.784
You see, when you give yourself

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:38.749
to me there's nothing left for you.

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:01.734
Chemist coming out.

01:19:02.029 --> 01:19:03.029
Open the door.

01:19:12.498 --> 01:19:13.498
- Hey!
- Huh?

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:14.582
Up there!

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:22.630
Guards, guards, quick!

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:24.132
To Overdog, more guards!

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:24.961
Guards!

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:26.261
Send in the guards!

01:19:26.387 --> 01:19:27.387
Overdog!

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:31.381
Guards! Guards! Guards!

01:20:07.011 --> 01:20:08.673
Hey, hang in there.

01:20:56.935 --> 01:21:01.020
I'm made of substance you
never dreamed of, Earther.

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:04.395
You can't hurt me.

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:06.059
But I can hurt you.

01:21:10.324 --> 01:21:12.532
See how helpless you are?

01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:15.489
I'm quite full of energy today.

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:16.788
Let her go!

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:18.530
I'll take her place.

01:21:18.832 --> 01:21:20.232
How do you know I won't

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:23.000
double-cross you and keep you both?

01:22:36.827 --> 01:22:38.667
Just happened to be in
the neighborhood, huh?

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:40.491
Ah, you two need a ride?

01:23:35.802 --> 01:23:37.197
Now I said, you're just
gonna get yourself killed,

01:23:37.221 --> 01:23:38.632
so I'll be stuck on this space hole

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:40.611
and not get a chance
to collect the reward.

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:42.327
I'd have given my half
just to see you digging

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:43.933
up this planet trying to find my ship.

01:23:45.562 --> 01:23:46.143
Thank you.

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:47.874
You sure you don't want to come with us?

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:49.685
No, our life is here.

01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:51.645
We really want to thank you two.

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:53.685
We really wanna thank you!

01:23:53.987 --> 01:23:55.148
Oh it was nothing.

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:55.982
Niki?

01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:56.816
That's right, nothing.

01:23:57.115 --> 01:24:00.153
Oh, Washington, you hurt too?

01:24:02.329 --> 01:24:04.195
Where are you going?

01:24:04.498 --> 01:24:05.033
Back.

01:24:05.332 --> 01:24:07.119
What were you expecting?

01:24:09.086 --> 01:24:10.418
I thought you wanted a lift?

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:13.125
You know, you really got one thick head.

01:24:13.423 --> 01:24:14.755
What's the matter with you?

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.042
The matter is you that never asked me.

01:24:17.344 --> 01:24:18.551
Asked you what?

01:24:21.098 --> 01:24:24.182
You never asked me to come with you.

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:27.601
I live alone now.

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.558
I can't take care of a,

01:24:29.856 --> 01:24:30.856
wait a minute!

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:43.818
I do want you to come.

01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:50.871
I want you to come with me.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:57.300
Trustwords?

01:25:01.346 --> 01:25:02.346
Trustwords.

01:25:13.817 --> 01:25:15.479
So what took you so long?

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:17.130
I mean, I knew we were
going to be partners

01:25:17.154 --> 01:25:19.362
together forever when we first met.

01:25:19.656 --> 01:25:20.656
Didn't you?

01:25:25.203 --> 01:25:26.203
Sure, kid.
