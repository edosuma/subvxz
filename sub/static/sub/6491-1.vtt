03:01.156 --> 03:02.573
Come, come.

03:08.663 --> 03:10.706
Are you authorized
to dress him like that?

03:10.790 --> 03:12.583
Oh, yes, sir.

03:14.919 --> 03:17.671
- A circus ape, huh?
- The only one to have been trained

03:17.755 --> 03:21.675
as a bareback rider
in the entire history of the circus.

03:21.759 --> 03:24.511
- Circuses are past history.
- Not while I live and breathe.

03:24.596 --> 03:27.681
- All right, SeÃ±or Armando. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

03:27.765 --> 03:29.765
Come, come.

03:54.334 --> 03:57.336
- Did I do all right?
- Yes, yes, yes.

03:57.420 --> 04:00.047
But try to walk a little more
like a primitive chimpanzee.

04:00.131 --> 04:05.385
Your arms should move
up and down from the shoulder... like so.

04:05.470 --> 04:07.804
Yes, that's better.

04:07.889 --> 04:11.850
After 20 years, you've picked up
evolved habits from me.

04:11.935 --> 04:15.687
That could be dangerous. Even fatal.

04:15.772 --> 04:18.732
- Armando, I don't understand.
- Listen to me, Caesar.

04:18.815 --> 04:21.401
There can be only
one talking chimpanzee on Earth.

04:21.486 --> 04:24.821
The child of the two talking apes,
Cornelius and Zira,

04:24.906 --> 04:27.074
who came to us years ago
out of the future

04:27.158 --> 04:28.909
and were murdered for fear

04:28.993 --> 04:33.121
that one distant day
apes might dominate the human race.

04:33.206 --> 04:36.166
Yeah, but outside of you,
nobody even knows I exist.

04:36.251 --> 04:38.919
And we must keep it that way,
for the fear remains.

04:39.003 --> 04:44.424
The mere fact of your existence would be
regarded as a great threat to mankind.

04:44.509 --> 04:45.842
Come. Come.

05:03.861 --> 05:05.821
Attention, this is the watch commander.

05:05.905 --> 05:09.074
Disperse apes gathering in the mall.

05:09.158 --> 05:13.245
Repeat: disperse apes
gathering in the mall.

05:13.329 --> 05:17.708
Take the serial number of each offender
and notify Ape Control immediately.

05:17.792 --> 05:20.752
Repeat: take the serial number
of each offender

05:20.837 --> 05:23.839
and notify Ape Control immediately.

05:23.923 --> 05:26.341
Their masters are to be cited and fined.

05:26.426 --> 05:30.512
Repeat: their masters
are to be cited and fined.

06:18.936 --> 06:22.272
Attention. Attention.
This is the watch commander.

06:22.357 --> 06:23.857
Attention. Attention.

06:23.941 --> 06:28.320
Disperse unauthorized ape gathering
at the foot of ramp six.

06:28.404 --> 06:33.909
Repeat: disperse unauthorized
ape gathering at the foot of ramp six.

06:33.993 --> 06:36.495
No citation or fine in this instance.

06:36.579 --> 06:39.414
Repeat: no citation or fine in this...

06:39.499 --> 06:41.666
But how did it happen?

06:49.008 --> 06:52.511
Go! Go!

06:52.595 --> 06:55.472
No! No!

07:05.233 --> 07:06.817
Go! You go!

07:12.323 --> 07:16.410
But you said humans treated apes
like pets.

07:16.494 --> 07:20.330
- They did, in the beginning.
- They've made slaves of them!

07:29.048 --> 07:31.675
They all died within a few months,
eight years ago.

07:31.759 --> 07:35.137
Every dog and cat in the world.
It was like a plague.

07:35.221 --> 07:39.683
The disease that killed them was a virus
brought back from space by an astronaut.

07:39.767 --> 07:42.686
- Didn't the disease affect humans?
- We were immune.

07:42.770 --> 07:46.356
And so, it was discovered, were simians,
even the smallest ones.

07:46.441 --> 07:48.150
That's how it began.

07:48.234 --> 07:52.279
Humans wanting little household pets
to replace the ones they had lost.

07:52.363 --> 07:57.951
Then, when people realized how quick
they were to learn, how easy to train,

07:58.035 --> 08:04.541
the pets became larger,
and larger, until now...

08:04.625 --> 08:06.376
It's monstrous.

08:10.298 --> 08:13.633
Now you understand
why I've kept you away.

08:14.010 --> 08:16.344
Yes, Lisa.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.889
A Young Queen Falls for Mrs Riley.

08:34.864 --> 08:35.905
No!

08:43.289 --> 08:44.414
Lisa.

08:47.043 --> 08:49.169
Yes?

08:49.253 --> 08:52.881
Could you possibly be so kind
as to display it in your window?

08:52.965 --> 08:55.467
- When I have the time.
- Thank you.

09:02.433 --> 09:04.476
The labor demonstration
on the South Plaza

09:04.560 --> 09:07.354
will be terminated in ten minutes.

09:07.438 --> 09:11.358
Repeat: the labor demonstration
on the South Plaza

09:11.442 --> 09:13.902
will be terminated in ten minutes.

09:22.537 --> 09:24.162
Thank you, Frank.

09:27.208 --> 09:31.044
Funny. Now that I know they
won't kill me, I don't enjoy them.

09:34.966 --> 09:37.467
Well, for heaven's sakes! A circus!

10:11.002 --> 10:12.502
Home, Lisa.

10:24.890 --> 10:27.100
- Yes?
- Oh, I was wondering,

10:27.184 --> 10:31.313
would you be kind enough
to display a couple of these posters?

10:33.274 --> 10:36.109
- Stop it!
- No, Zelda! No!

10:36.193 --> 10:38.695
Home, Zelda.

10:38.779 --> 10:42.490
I'm so sorry, Mrs Riley. I'll have
someone to comb you out in a minute.

10:42.575 --> 10:45.035
I wanna be combed out now.
I have a luncheon.

10:45.328 --> 10:47.829
- Thursday, then.
- Thursday.

10:47.913 --> 10:50.957
I... I forgot the waiter
and I'm all out of raisins.

10:51.042 --> 10:53.084
- Take mine.
- Thank you.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.256
You're overtipping.

11:02.011 --> 11:03.887
No! No! No!

11:05.431 --> 11:08.224
And I told them to condition him to fire.

11:13.731 --> 11:17.400
Attention. The labor demonstration
on the South Plaza

11:17.818 --> 11:19.778
will be terminated in five minutes.

11:19.862 --> 11:23.156
Repeat: the labor demonstration
on the South Plaza

11:23.240 --> 11:25.867
will be terminated in five minutes.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.952
Failure to comply with this order

11:28.037 --> 11:33.333
can result in a one-year suspension
of your right to bargain collectively.

11:33.417 --> 11:35.502
- What's his job?
- He's a messenger.

11:35.586 --> 11:37.837
For the governor, so get!

11:41.717 --> 11:43.343
No! No! No!

11:50.893 --> 11:54.771
- Stop that at once! All of you!
- Yes, sir, Mr MacDonald. We were just...

11:54.855 --> 11:58.650
I saw what you were doing. Now sedate
the animal and get him out of here.

11:58.734 --> 12:03.154
- Who the hell's that?
- The governor's number-one assistant.

12:03.239 --> 12:06.408
- He love apes or something?
- Don't it figure?

12:08.369 --> 12:09.744
Hold him.

12:12.206 --> 12:14.124
Lousy human bastards!

12:21.298 --> 12:22.882
Who said that?

12:24.176 --> 12:25.343
I did.

12:26.512 --> 12:29.556
He's a performing ape for my circus.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.225
- A talking ape?
- No! No, no.

12:32.309 --> 12:34.519
No, that's impossible.
It was I who spoke.

12:34.603 --> 12:36.646
It didn't sound like your voice.

12:36.731 --> 12:39.733
Yell "Lousy human bastards."

12:39.817 --> 12:42.235
- That's not what I said.
- That's what I heard.

12:42.319 --> 12:45.572
Now, look, mister,
you yell "Lousy human bastards."

12:47.032 --> 12:50.285
- Lousy human bastards.
- We said yell!

12:50.369 --> 12:52.912
Lousy human bastards!

12:52.997 --> 12:55.290
- Yeah, yeah. Could be.
- I don't think so.

12:55.374 --> 12:57.959
- It's right. The ape spoke.
- Yeah!

12:58.127 --> 12:59.669
No! No, they're mistaken.

12:59.754 --> 13:03.590
I admit my behavior was inexcusable
and I am deeply sorry.

13:03.674 --> 13:06.926
I think we better take him
to headquarters for interrogation.

13:07.011 --> 13:08.344
Guard!

13:32.203 --> 13:33.578
Move him on.

13:41.545 --> 13:44.798
- Armando, forgive me.
- Oh, no, no.

13:44.882 --> 13:47.801
You only said aloud what I was thinking.

13:47.885 --> 13:51.221
I'm sorry. I was so angry.

13:51.305 --> 13:54.307
I might have bluffed it through
if you hadn't run away.

13:54.391 --> 13:57.393
Now they suspect you
of understanding all that was said.

13:57.478 --> 14:02.982
- Armando, let's go back to the circus.
- No, no, no.

14:03.067 --> 14:06.820
- Oh, no, please.
- No, that's the first place they'll look.

14:24.255 --> 14:28.174
Here's what we'll do. I'll go to the police.

14:28.259 --> 14:31.010
- Oh, no, no!
- It's the only way!

14:31.095 --> 14:35.223
I'll say that... that I couldn't find you.

14:35.307 --> 14:38.059
That... you've run away before.

14:38.143 --> 14:41.563
- That big cities frighten you.
- But, Armando, where would I go?

14:41.647 --> 14:44.983
You wait right here!
If this works, I'll be back by nightfall.

14:45.067 --> 14:49.529
- But what if they don't let you go?
- Oh, they will. They will.

14:51.907 --> 14:55.577
But just in case, if I am not back by then...

14:55.661 --> 15:00.081
Now, these steps go down
to a tunnel that leads to the harbor.

15:00.165 --> 15:03.126
Cargoes of apes are frequently
unloaded at night.

15:03.210 --> 15:06.296
- You must try to infiltrate one of them.
- But, Armando...

15:06.380 --> 15:09.340
Apes imported from overseas
arrive naked,

15:09.425 --> 15:10.884
so you'll have to get rid of these clothes.

15:10.968 --> 15:14.596
- Well, I don't want to.
- We must have an alternate plan!

15:17.474 --> 15:21.477
Right now, the only safe
hiding place for you

15:21.562 --> 15:23.479
is among your own kind.

15:38.037 --> 15:40.038
I shouldn't be long.

15:53.844 --> 15:55.678
Why would you say "human"?

15:55.763 --> 15:58.973
"Human." That's a very odd thing
for another human being to say.

15:59.058 --> 16:02.602
I didn't say "human," Mr Governor.
I said "inhuman."

16:02.686 --> 16:04.854
Lousy inhuman bastards.

16:04.939 --> 16:08.441
And by the blessed St Francis,
who loved all animals, I meant it.

16:08.525 --> 16:11.110
- You see, I run a circus...
- We know that.

16:11.195 --> 16:16.282
- From 20 years back.
- Since the talking apes arrived on Earth

16:16.367 --> 16:18.743
and conceived a baby whose
survival could have threatened

16:18.827 --> 16:20.912
the future of the human race.

16:20.996 --> 16:24.916
Mr Governor, I understand
the baby was shot dead with its parents.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.044
Or so it was believed, Mr MacDonald.

16:28.128 --> 16:30.088
However, since this morning,

16:30.172 --> 16:32.632
I'm beginning to wonder
if they shot the right baby.

16:32.716 --> 16:36.094
The apes could have switched
their baby with one from the zoo.

16:36.178 --> 16:37.971
Or perhaps a circus.

16:38.055 --> 16:41.516
Surely, Mr Governor, you can't be serious!

16:41.600 --> 16:43.851
Hoskyns, the cassette, please.

16:46.855 --> 16:51.484
These are the recommendations made to
the then president of the United States

16:51.568 --> 16:54.737
by the chairman
of the Presidential Committee.

16:58.409 --> 17:03.246
And we believe that the male and female
talking apes, Cornelius and Zira,

17:03.330 --> 17:05.999
have come to us out of the future.

17:06.083 --> 17:10.127
We believe their spoken testimony,
that some 2,000 years hence,

17:10.212 --> 17:14.757
their descendants will have all but
exterminated the human race from Earth.

17:14.842 --> 17:19.095
And we know that the female ape
is now pregnant with child.

17:19.179 --> 17:21.723
The commission therefore recommends

17:21.807 --> 17:26.602
that the birth of the female ape's
unborn child should be prevented

17:26.686 --> 17:30.023
and that both the male and the female

17:30.107 --> 17:33.317
should be rendered
incapable of begetting another.

17:38.157 --> 17:42.618
But, Mr Governor, every zoo, public
and private, was searched by the police,

17:42.703 --> 17:44.787
and every circus, including my own.

17:44.872 --> 17:49.584
- But a small chimpanzee was found.
- The only one ever to be born in a circus,

17:49.668 --> 17:52.879
and legally certified
to have been born a month -

17:52.963 --> 17:57.050
a month - before the talking apes
arrived on earth.

17:57.134 --> 18:00.595
- Where is he now?
- I wish I knew. I've searched everywhere.

18:00.679 --> 18:03.014
SeÃ±or Armando!

18:03.098 --> 18:05.725
Let me remind you...

18:05.809 --> 18:08.269
of the seriousness of our problem.

18:09.730 --> 18:11.314
Now.

18:11.398 --> 18:14.984
Your circus travels mainly
in the provinces?

18:15.069 --> 18:16.069
Yes, sir.

18:16.153 --> 18:20.573
Then, undoubtedly, you are unaware
of the rising tide of disobedience,

18:20.657 --> 18:25.078
the outright defiance, among
the servant apes in our cities.

18:25.162 --> 18:29.707
Mr Governor, on investigation, many
of the offenses have been proved minor.

18:29.833 --> 18:33.169
The ape killed while trying
to escape from the city last night,

18:33.253 --> 18:36.839
- would you call his offense minor?
- No, sir, I would not.

18:36.924 --> 18:39.592
He physically assaulted his own master.

18:39.676 --> 18:42.386
But only after what must have
been severe provocation.

18:42.471 --> 18:46.641
The ape's body was covered with
welts and bruises inflicted by a beating.

18:46.725 --> 18:49.185
Which he no doubt richly deserved.

18:50.437 --> 18:53.773
How many more of them out there
are just like that ape?

18:53.857 --> 18:56.776
All burning with resentment.

18:56.860 --> 19:00.238
Or waiting. Waiting for an ape
with enough intelligence,

19:00.322 --> 19:02.740
with enough will, to lead them.

19:02.825 --> 19:07.286
Waiting for an ape who can think.
Who can talk.

19:10.124 --> 19:12.792
SeÃ±or Armando,

19:12.876 --> 19:17.630
has your ape ever talked or shown any
signs of being articulate in your presence?

19:17.714 --> 19:20.800
Never in my presence, or anyone else's.

19:20.884 --> 19:23.094
You can question my circus hands.

19:23.178 --> 19:25.138
We intend to.

19:25.222 --> 19:27.849
Meanwhile, you will remain in custody.

21:00.776 --> 21:05.029
Shipment 507, I for Indonesia, ex-Borneo,

21:05.113 --> 21:08.157
now arriving at gate number two.

21:12.913 --> 21:18.626
Shipment 509, A for Africa,
ex-French Cameroons,

21:18.710 --> 21:21.337
now arriving at number four gate.

21:22.631 --> 21:27.802
After fingerprinting, shipment 507,
I for Indonesia, ex-Borneo,

21:27.886 --> 21:31.639
will proceed direct
to conditioning cage 90.

21:31.723 --> 21:36.978
After fingerprinting, shipment 507,
I for Indonesia, ex-Borneo,

21:37.062 --> 21:40.856
will proceed direct
to conditioning cage 90.

21:40.941 --> 21:44.777
Immigration personnel are reminded
that, until further notice,

21:44.861 --> 21:47.863
police have requested one additional copy

21:47.948 --> 21:50.783
of all chimpanzee fingerprints
for their files.

21:50.867 --> 21:55.288
Repeat: immigration personnel are
reminded that until further notice,

21:55.372 --> 21:58.207
police have requested one additional copy

21:58.292 --> 22:00.960
of all chimpanzee fingerprints
for their files.

22:44.588 --> 22:45.713
Do!

23:20.332 --> 23:21.457
Next!

23:32.803 --> 23:43.145
No!

24:07.462 --> 24:09.422
They're a bit uppity.
I haven't fed them yet.

24:09.506 --> 24:12.383
Come on!

24:12.467 --> 24:13.843
Switch off.

24:22.477 --> 24:23.811
Switch on.

25:19.326 --> 25:21.577
Have you seen this ape before?

25:23.121 --> 25:26.165
Isn't it... Cornelius?

25:26.249 --> 25:28.375
I thought you didn't know him?

25:28.460 --> 25:32.505
B-But you told me yourself.
T-The talking ape that was murdered...

25:32.589 --> 25:35.257
- Executed.
- Executed.

25:35.342 --> 25:37.927
- Would you say there's a resemblance?
- Oh, no.

25:38.011 --> 25:40.679
Look very carefully.

25:40.764 --> 25:45.184
- Like father, like son, eh?
- No. No!

25:45.268 --> 25:48.437
You'd do well to cooperate with us.

25:48.522 --> 25:52.608
l-I... Could I...
Could I please have a glass of water?

26:54.671 --> 26:55.796
Do.

27:03.722 --> 27:05.264
No!

27:05.348 --> 27:06.473
Do.

27:28.705 --> 27:42.009
No! No!

27:51.561 --> 27:52.603
Do.

28:05.492 --> 28:07.660
Attention. Training Control.

28:07.744 --> 28:10.204
Four females have arrived
for insemination -

28:10.288 --> 28:12.331
three gorillas and one chimpanzee.

28:12.415 --> 28:14.416
Please select four superior males -

28:14.501 --> 28:19.380
three gorillas, one chimpanzee - and send
them to the breeding annex immediately.

29:08.888 --> 29:10.889
254 process for auction.

29:10.974 --> 29:13.058
Yes, ma"am, for immediate sale.

29:13.143 --> 29:18.021
One male gorilla, age seven.
Fully conditioned bedmaker, grade A.

29:18.106 --> 29:21.483
Yes, yes.
You will be credited after auction.

30:01.191 --> 30:03.108
So you're a member of Breck's party.

30:03.193 --> 30:05.402
Now I understand
how you got those big contracts.

30:05.487 --> 30:08.280
He's good for this country.
Good for all of us.

30:08.364 --> 30:09.907
You really think he's gonna make it?

30:09.991 --> 30:12.743
I don't know of anyone
who could stop him.

30:12.827 --> 30:14.536
Bring up lot eight!

30:16.289 --> 30:20.042
Lot eight! One male chimpanzee!

30:20.126 --> 30:23.796
In early prime
and perfect physical condition.

30:23.880 --> 30:26.548
Take a good look at this specimen.

30:26.633 --> 30:29.510
This has to be the buy of the afternoon.

30:29.594 --> 30:33.055
Early prime. Perfect physical condition.

30:33.139 --> 30:36.809
Under observation, he appeared
so familiar, obedient, docile

30:36.893 --> 30:38.811
and intelligent with humans

30:38.895 --> 30:42.314
that conditioning
was not considered necessary.

30:42.398 --> 30:46.819
But it certainly can be provided
on request.

30:46.903 --> 30:51.824
We're gonna start the bidding
on this specimen at $800.

30:51.908 --> 30:55.619
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
what am I bid on this superb specimen?

30:55.703 --> 30:59.164
Bidding starts at 800. 800.

30:59.249 --> 31:02.626
What am I bid for this superb specimen?

31:02.710 --> 31:03.752
800. 800.

31:03.837 --> 31:06.922
- 850!
- 850 over here. Do I hear nine?

31:07.006 --> 31:09.675
- 900!
- I hear nine over there! Nine over there!

31:09.759 --> 31:12.010
- 950.
- 950 over there on the end.

31:12.095 --> 31:13.595
- 1,000.
- 1,000 from the gentleman

31:13.680 --> 31:16.473
on the end. $1,000.

31:16.558 --> 31:18.433
- 1100!
- 1100 over here.

31:18.518 --> 31:20.143
- 1150.
- 1150 in the back row.

31:20.228 --> 31:23.021
- 1200
- $1200 from this gentleman.

31:23.106 --> 31:25.899
Going to this gentleman. Going! Going...

31:25.984 --> 31:27.526
- Buy him.
- 1500!

31:27.610 --> 31:29.695
1500 from Mr MacDonald!

31:29.779 --> 31:32.948
For His Excellency, Governor Breck.

31:33.032 --> 31:35.742
Going! Going!

31:35.827 --> 31:36.827
Gone!

31:41.165 --> 31:42.291
Come.

31:45.628 --> 31:50.382
It's very good, Morgan, but simplify
the wording in that last paragraph.

31:50.466 --> 31:54.428
Sir, we've received a disappointing
report on the automated sanitation plan.

31:54.512 --> 31:58.557
- You have a meeting with Curfew Control.
- Cancel it, Miss Greer.

31:58.641 --> 32:01.018
These figures, did you double-check them?

32:01.102 --> 32:03.395
- Yes, sir.
- Triple-check them!

32:03.479 --> 32:07.232
- Come.
- Hold all calls, Miss Greer.

32:07.317 --> 32:10.736
Here's the IQ profile on all apes
tested within the last four weeks.

32:10.820 --> 32:12.529
It's risen by 32/3 points.

32:12.614 --> 32:15.949
Uh-huh! Show Mr MacDonald.
He thinks I'm imagining things.

32:16.034 --> 32:18.577
I assembled that.
You summarized the wrong part.

32:18.661 --> 32:21.788
So their output has increased
about the same percentage,

32:21.873 --> 32:25.250
which I thought the governor
might regard as good news.

32:25.335 --> 32:28.170
It's all right. We'll go over that later.

32:32.258 --> 32:33.342
No.

32:35.970 --> 32:37.179
Watch.

32:56.532 --> 32:57.699
Do.

33:17.387 --> 33:21.473
No, no, no. Clean. Clean.

33:21.557 --> 33:23.892
It seems the little fella's
not so bright after all.

33:23.977 --> 33:27.312
No. But brightness has never
been encouraged amongst slaves.

33:27.397 --> 33:30.691
Oh, don't be so touchy, Mr MacDonald.

33:30.775 --> 33:34.361
All of us were slaves once,
in one sense of the word or another.

33:34.445 --> 33:37.906
If you feel the ape's unsatisfactory,
we can have him reconditioned.

33:37.991 --> 33:41.284
- That isn't necessary.
- You're quite right, Mr MacDonald.

33:41.369 --> 33:44.579
But not for any
of your bleeding-heart reasons.

33:44.664 --> 33:47.916
Reconditioning. That's all
any of you ever think of, isn't it?

33:48.001 --> 33:52.462
Don't you realize, if we were to take
every ape who disobeyed an order

33:52.547 --> 33:57.009
and sent him back for reconditioning, Ape
Management would become overcrowded.

33:57.093 --> 34:01.138
- It's the only thing that has any effect.
- Just makes them worse.

34:01.222 --> 34:03.473
Some of them couldn't be worse.

34:03.558 --> 34:05.851
I've been having
a comprehensive list compiled.

34:05.935 --> 34:08.520
- Mr Governor.
- Yes, what is it you want?

34:08.603 --> 34:10.856
It's your meeting
with the Defense Council.

34:10.940 --> 34:12.565
I'll be along in a moment.

34:12.650 --> 34:15.360
- Defense Council?
- I'll tell you about it later.

34:15.445 --> 34:17.195
Is this related to the list you mentioned?

34:17.280 --> 34:20.407
You'll be given full details, Mr MacDonald.

34:20.491 --> 34:22.951
Meanwhile, we're going
to set a good example

34:23.036 --> 34:25.411
and recondition this fella ourselves.

34:25.496 --> 34:28.706
- We haven't named him yet, have we?
- No, Mr Breck.

34:28.791 --> 34:31.001
I'm going to revive a charming tradition

34:31.085 --> 34:33.712
established in her lifetime
by my dear wife,

34:33.795 --> 34:35.797
and let you name yourself.

35:08.831 --> 35:13.043
'Caesar.' A king.

35:19.842 --> 35:20.926
Yes?

35:23.179 --> 35:26.389
They're waiting for you
in the council chamber.

35:28.017 --> 35:31.478
I don't think we'll ever make
a bartender out of Caesar.

35:31.562 --> 35:33.355
Have him detailed to the Command Post.

36:05.263 --> 36:06.304
No!

36:19.152 --> 36:20.402
Attention.

36:20.486 --> 36:25.115
There is a report of unescorted apes
in the Plaza. Investigate.

36:35.626 --> 36:36.918
Can I help you, Mr MacDonald?

36:37.003 --> 36:39.671
This ape's assigned to the Command Post.

36:39.755 --> 36:41.798
- What's his name, sir?
- Caesar.

36:41.883 --> 36:44.426
Start him off in the files.
Low-priority traffic.

36:44.510 --> 36:45.886
Yes, sir.

36:49.432 --> 36:50.432
Do!

36:53.936 --> 36:56.938
Lisa. Lisa!

37:08.910 --> 37:11.995
Ah! SeÃ±or Armando!

37:12.079 --> 37:15.415
- This way, seÃ±or. This way.
- Sit down, sit down.

37:15.499 --> 37:17.542
We have good news for you.

37:19.754 --> 37:23.632
- Good news?
- Yes. You're to be released.

37:23.716 --> 37:26.218
Inspector Hoskyns and I believe
that your ape

37:26.302 --> 37:29.596
is not the child
of the talking chimpanzees.

37:33.434 --> 37:37.229
- You found him?
- Not yet, but he'll turn up sooner or later.

37:37.313 --> 37:40.482
I'm sorry for the inconvenience
we had to cause you.

37:40.566 --> 37:42.901
Do forgive us, but it was unavoidable.

37:42.985 --> 37:44.444
Oh, yes. Yes.

37:47.490 --> 37:49.324
Then I'm... I'm free to go?

37:49.408 --> 37:52.494
Oh, as soon as you sign
this sworn declaration.

37:55.581 --> 37:56.581
What does it say?

37:56.666 --> 37:58.792
Only what you've been telling us all along.

37:58.876 --> 38:01.795
The circus ape
is incapable of human speech and,

38:01.879 --> 38:04.589
to the best of your knowledge,
he's never uttered a word.

38:04.674 --> 38:06.675
Certainly.

38:06.759 --> 38:13.098
Excellent. Now we'll check this with the
authenticator, then you'll be free to go.

38:13.182 --> 38:16.268
The... authenticator?

38:16.352 --> 38:20.689
It's just a formality. Sit back down,
please. It'll just take a moment.

38:35.830 --> 38:38.331
What does the authenticator do?

38:38.416 --> 38:42.002
Makes people tell the truth.
It's quite painless.

38:42.086 --> 38:45.630
For example, you said you first
heard the name Cornelius in this office.

38:45.715 --> 38:47.299
Was that true?

38:58.311 --> 39:02.814
- No.
- Now, there! You see?

39:02.898 --> 39:05.025
That's not a bad black mark against you.

39:05.109 --> 39:08.069
You probably heard it
somewhere else before.

39:08.154 --> 39:13.158
Now. About your statement,
sworn statement,

39:13.242 --> 39:16.494
that the circus ape is incapable of speech.

39:16.579 --> 39:19.664
- No. I won't submit to this.
- You will, SeÃ±or Armando!

39:19.749 --> 39:24.002
I have done nothing wrong!
You are treating me like a criminal!

39:24.086 --> 39:25.712
Sit back, please.

39:27.006 --> 39:28.840
No! No, no.

39:28.924 --> 39:30.842
- Guard!
- No!

39:30.926 --> 39:31.926
No!

39:49.820 --> 39:52.197
I knew that circus owner was lying.

39:52.281 --> 39:54.366
They insist he
fell to his death accidentally.

39:54.450 --> 39:57.660
While trying to escape!
He knew he'd been exposed.

41:26.208 --> 41:28.668
Attention. Attention.

41:28.752 --> 41:33.214
Last night, several security forces
apprehended and placed in custody

41:33.299 --> 41:38.303
a number of servant apes from widely
scattered households throughout the city,

41:38.387 --> 41:41.639
who had gathered clandestinely
in the unused building

41:41.724 --> 41:44.767
on the outskirts of the East Sector.

41:44.852 --> 41:49.063
Property owners are firmly warned
that they bear sole responsibility

41:49.148 --> 41:52.567
for the behavior
and whereabouts of their servant apes.

42:45.579 --> 42:46.746
Frank!

42:52.795 --> 42:53.962
Frank.

43:00.469 --> 43:01.636
No!

43:25.494 --> 43:30.248
"One dozen steaks, New York cut,
for Mrs Van Thal."

43:33.252 --> 43:36.879
Add one gallon of... No.

43:36.964 --> 43:41.259
Two gallons

43:41.343 --> 43:44.304
of kerosene.

43:57.401 --> 44:00.278
Mr Governor.
The latest ape-disobedience figures.

44:00.362 --> 44:02.780
There's been a marked increase
in property damage.

44:02.865 --> 44:05.783
Couldn't all be carelessness,
Mr MacDonald!

44:05.868 --> 44:08.536
Arrange for distribution of the Achilles list.

44:08.621 --> 44:14.125
Copies to each police precinct. Details are
to be left to the individual commanders,

44:14.209 --> 44:16.461
but I want every ape on that list

44:16.545 --> 44:20.840
delivered to the reconditioning center
by 0600 tomorrow morning.

44:20.924 --> 44:23.468
I'm sorry, 309. The cages are full.

44:23.552 --> 44:27.305
We cannot accommodate any new intakes
until after Tuesday's auction.

44:36.565 --> 44:41.653
"Collect one repaired Colt 45."

44:41.737 --> 44:43.905
And...

44:43.989 --> 44:49.452
100 rounds ammunition.

44:55.834 --> 45:00.380
The Achilles list, Mr MacDonald,
referring to our Achilles heel,

45:00.464 --> 45:02.882
contains the name of every ape
who, over the past year,

45:02.966 --> 45:05.677
has been overtly disobedient.

45:05.761 --> 45:08.388
The charge against them is nonsense.

45:08.472 --> 45:10.640
It will do for my purposes.

45:10.766 --> 45:13.017
They constitute
the hard core of our problem

45:13.102 --> 45:15.186
and I'm going to crush them
once and for all!

45:15.270 --> 45:18.189
Sir, you will only further
aggravate the problem.

45:18.273 --> 45:24.278
This action is folly, and I wish to protest
it in the strongest possible terms.

45:24.363 --> 45:26.322
Very well, Mr MacDonald.

45:26.407 --> 45:29.575
Your protest has been duly noted.

45:29.660 --> 45:34.288
From now on, you have but
one assignment: to find that talking ape.

45:49.221 --> 45:53.224
- What is this? A red alert?
- Sort of.

45:53.308 --> 45:56.853
Ape Management computer's
come up with an intriguing error.

45:56.937 --> 46:02.984
Shipment 507, I for Indonesia, comprised
three orangutans and one chimpanzee.

46:03.068 --> 46:07.405
- So?
- There are no chimpanzees in Borneo.

46:07.489 --> 46:08.823
Yes, sir.

46:08.907 --> 46:12.744
State Security Chief
Inspector Kolp on line three.

46:12.828 --> 46:14.912
Yes, Inspector.

46:14.997 --> 46:18.541
Give me the Indonesia file for last month.

46:18.625 --> 46:24.005
That's 507, ex-Borneo.
Right, Inspector. Let me check.

46:24.089 --> 46:29.177
507, ex-Borneo. Yes, sir. That
chimpanzee was sold to Governor Breck.

46:29.511 --> 46:31.929
Good God! Just as I first thought.

46:32.014 --> 46:34.515
We've had him under our noses
all the time!

46:34.600 --> 46:38.770
Sir, I'm willing to have the ape executed
immediately on your verbal orders alone.

46:38.854 --> 46:41.397
- You'll have it in writing.
- Thank you, sir.

46:41.482 --> 46:43.816
Get Mr MacDonald at the Command Post.

46:43.901 --> 46:46.277
However, suppose he can speak
but won't?

46:46.361 --> 46:47.945
I don't understand.

46:48.030 --> 46:51.783
The chief inspector means
there'd still be a doubt.

46:51.867 --> 46:54.535
If the chimpanzee keeps his mouth shut,
the case stays open.

46:54.620 --> 46:56.496
We'd like to close the file.

46:56.580 --> 46:58.873
You shall. I promise you.

46:59.416 --> 47:03.211
Reconditioning applications
have to be made out in triplicate.

47:06.715 --> 47:10.718
MacDonald speaking. Yes, sir.

47:10.803 --> 47:13.971
You want me to turn Caesar
over to Inspector Kolp?

47:14.056 --> 47:16.599
Is he on your Achilles list?

47:16.683 --> 47:20.394
Mr MacDonald, do not question an order.

47:20.479 --> 47:25.650
No, sir, I'm not questioning
the order. It's just that...

47:25.734 --> 47:30.363
Well, I sent him out on an errand.
He should be back momentarily.

47:30.447 --> 47:33.115
Yes, sir. I'll do just as you say.

47:48.215 --> 47:49.423
Come.

47:59.560 --> 48:03.521
- No, this goes to Traffic Control!
- Take it easy. They can't read.

48:03.605 --> 48:05.481
Not yet, they can't.

48:09.278 --> 48:10.444
Do.

48:13.365 --> 48:16.450
Mr MacDonald, are you near a phone?

48:19.329 --> 48:24.292
Mr MacDonald, it is imperative
that you get to a phone!

48:26.461 --> 48:29.881
Come in, Mr MacDonald! Do you hear me?

48:29.965 --> 48:34.218
Get to a phone and come in!

48:34.303 --> 48:35.803
Now, come in!

48:39.558 --> 48:43.060
- Yes, Mr Governor.
- Kolp is on his way down with the police.

48:43.145 --> 48:46.522
- Is Caesar back yet?
- Not yet, sir. I'll keep a look out.

48:46.607 --> 48:50.443
Notify me the moment
he's handed over to them.

48:50.527 --> 48:51.819
Yes, sir.

49:09.338 --> 49:12.173
I wish...

49:12.257 --> 49:16.928
I wish there was some way we could
communicate, so you'd understand that I...

49:20.474 --> 49:23.643
I understand,

49:23.727 --> 49:25.186
Mr MacDonald.

49:32.611 --> 49:36.697
Yes, I... I'm the one they're looking for.

49:47.793 --> 49:51.545
I never believed it.
I... I thought you were a myth.

49:51.630 --> 49:55.174
Well, I'm not.

49:55.258 --> 49:58.010
But I will tell you something that is.

49:58.095 --> 50:00.930
The belief that human beings are kind...

50:01.014 --> 50:03.057
No, Caesar. There are some...

50:03.141 --> 50:05.393
A handful, perhaps, but not most of them.

50:05.477 --> 50:09.563
They won't learn to be kind
until we force them to.

50:09.648 --> 50:13.150
We can't do that until we are free.

50:13.235 --> 50:17.238
How do you propose to gain this freedom?

50:17.322 --> 50:21.033
By the only means left to us.

50:21.118 --> 50:24.996
- Revolution.
- But... it's doomed to failure!

50:25.080 --> 50:27.707
Perhaps... this time.

50:27.791 --> 50:30.209
- And the next.
- Maybe.

50:30.293 --> 50:33.879
- But you'll keep trying.
- You, above everyone else,

50:33.964 --> 50:36.590
should understand.

50:36.675 --> 50:40.386
We cannot be free until we have power.

50:40.470 --> 50:42.596
How else can we achieve it?

50:53.316 --> 50:54.358
Go.

51:06.621 --> 51:11.709
Ah, Mr MacDonald, I have an order from
the governor to take Caesar into custody.

51:11.793 --> 51:13.878
I know. I've been looking for him.

51:13.962 --> 51:16.464
- He's not in the Command Post?
- No.

51:16.548 --> 51:19.759
Issue an order to round up
all unaccompanied apes.

53:10.620 --> 53:13.414
I still don't see why he made a run for it.

53:13.498 --> 53:17.668
It's really quite simple, Mr MacDonald.
The ape has intelligence.

53:17.752 --> 53:20.713
He knew that his friend Armando
was dead.

53:20.839 --> 53:23.966
He assumed the man first
betrayed him under torture.

53:24.050 --> 53:26.468
But we don't do that... to humans.

53:33.643 --> 53:34.727
Now.

53:43.820 --> 54:23.317
Talk!

54:49.344 --> 54:52.096
Have...

54:52.180 --> 54:54.848
Ha... Have pity.

55:01.064 --> 55:05.401
That's incredible! Well, there's your proof!

55:05.485 --> 55:07.361
We're convinced, Mr Governor.

55:07.445 --> 55:13.742
It's fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.
Have him say something else.

55:17.372 --> 55:20.040
You heard the governor.

55:23.003 --> 55:24.003
Answer!

55:31.136 --> 55:34.805
- We could persuade him.
- No.

55:34.889 --> 55:38.058
He's not responsible for what he is.

55:38.143 --> 55:42.563
Still, seeing him there, it's like
looking at some deadly bacillus and...

55:42.689 --> 55:45.482
knowing you've got it bottled up at last.

55:51.406 --> 55:54.408
- Is that all, sir?
- Not quite.

55:56.411 --> 56:00.247
I have an authorization here from
the governor to have this beast destroyed.

56:00.332 --> 56:02.750
I'll notify the vet to inject him.

56:03.585 --> 56:06.879
- He is wired for electrocution, isn't he?
- Oh, yes.

56:06.963 --> 56:08.297
Well, then, electrocute him. Now.

56:43.958 --> 56:45.709
- He's dead.
- Good.

57:01.810 --> 57:04.937
- Good work, Inspector.
- What happened to Mr MacDonald?

57:05.021 --> 57:09.316
I'm afraid his sensibility...
Ah, there you are!

57:09.401 --> 57:13.237
- Is it over?
- Yes, it's over.

57:13.321 --> 57:15.322
Shall we go back to work?

58:20.680 --> 58:21.930
Lisa.

59:59.522 --> 01:00:03.483
All keepers and handlers,
attention. Attention!

01:00:03.568 --> 01:00:08.655
All keepers and handlers.
There is $50,000 worth of apes in jeopardy.

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:11.325
Get them out of here... alive!

01:01:59.517 --> 01:02:03.437
Yes. Commander, I understand
the situation.

01:02:03.521 --> 01:02:07.107
Assemble as large a force
as you can and follow them.

01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:14.072
Mobilize all security forces,
police, militia and reserve defense units.

01:02:14.157 --> 01:02:17.242
See that every entrance
into the city is cordoned off.

01:02:17.326 --> 01:02:20.287
Will control methods include
tear gas and sedation darts?

01:02:20.371 --> 01:02:23.957
There will be but one
control method: shoot to kill.

01:02:25.626 --> 01:02:29.629
A small group of apes,
scheduled for intensive reconditioning,

01:02:29.714 --> 01:02:32.132
have escaped from Ape Management.

01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:34.009
Until they've been rounded up
by the police,

01:02:34.093 --> 01:02:37.387
all citizens are requested
to remain indoors.

01:02:37.472 --> 01:02:41.183
A further announcement will be made
as soon as recapture is effected.

01:02:41.267 --> 01:02:43.268
And, I guess, here it is.

01:02:45.563 --> 01:02:48.690
Ape Management is in
the hands of the apes.

01:02:48.775 --> 01:02:51.818
Many officials are either
dead or held hostage.

01:02:51.944 --> 01:02:55.989
The main band of rioting apes are
at this very moment marching on the city.

01:02:56.074 --> 01:02:59.326
It's been established that
the ape mob is under the command

01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:04.748
of a supernormally intelligent
chimpanzee who has...

01:03:04.832 --> 01:03:06.833
acquired the power of speech.

01:03:06.918 --> 01:03:10.170
That idiot!
Get out a retraction immediately!

01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:13.256
Announce that the talking ape
has been put to death!

01:03:13.341 --> 01:03:17.260
...the child of the two talking
chimpanzees, Cornelius and Zira,

01:03:17.345 --> 01:03:20.013
who came to us from
outer space 20 years ago.

01:03:20.098 --> 01:03:24.976
As such, he constitutes a threat
to the future of the whole human race.

01:03:48.709 --> 01:03:52.337
Governor Breck has just issued
this order to all civilians:

01:03:52.421 --> 01:03:53.797
go to your homes.

01:03:53.881 --> 01:03:56.675
Stay in your home and lock your doors.

01:03:56.759 --> 01:03:58.969
Above all, do not panic.

01:03:59.053 --> 01:04:01.471
Repeat: go to your homes.

01:04:01.556 --> 01:04:04.766
Stay in your homes and lock your doors.

01:04:04.851 --> 01:04:07.102
The situation can be kept under control

01:04:07.186 --> 01:04:11.314
provided our defense forces are
given complete freedom of movement.

01:06:13.145 --> 01:06:16.815
No! Go back!

01:06:16.899 --> 01:06:19.901
No! No!

01:06:19.986 --> 01:06:21.194
Go home!

01:06:31.622 --> 01:06:32.706
Back!

01:06:39.839 --> 01:06:41.881
Ready.

01:06:41.966 --> 01:06:43.133
Aim.

01:06:45.803 --> 01:06:47.053
Fire!

01:07:24.592 --> 01:07:25.759
Ready.

01:07:42.151 --> 01:07:43.234
Aim.

01:07:51.077 --> 01:07:52.285
Fire!

01:08:09.804 --> 01:08:11.346
Yes.

01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:14.933
Yes. Understood.

01:08:15.017 --> 01:08:17.894
Riot Control say the apes
have broken through the cordon.

01:08:17.978 --> 01:08:21.272
Advance units are approaching the Plaza.

01:08:21.357 --> 01:08:25.402
Order units four and six
into action immediately.

01:08:25.486 --> 01:08:26.528
Riot Control.

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:08.653
No!

01:09:15.911 --> 01:09:18.412
They've reached the Plaza.

01:09:18.497 --> 01:09:22.375
- Good God! They're armed!
- And organized.

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:27.421
- No! Home!
- Don't plead with them, you idiot!

01:09:31.469 --> 01:09:32.635
Ready!

01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:40.810
No!

01:09:40.895 --> 01:09:54.699
Home!

01:09:58.037 --> 01:09:59.078
Aim!

01:10:36.784 --> 01:10:37.909
Fire!

01:12:16.383 --> 01:12:18.968
What's the trouble down there?

01:12:19.053 --> 01:12:21.888
Like wild animals, they're smelling blood.

01:13:08.477 --> 01:13:10.436
My God! There's more!

01:15:50.848 --> 01:15:53.975
- They're inside the building.
- Alert all security posts!

01:15:54.059 --> 01:15:57.770
- Right, sir.
- No! No!

01:15:57.855 --> 01:15:59.564
The circuits are dead.

01:15:59.648 --> 01:16:04.610
Take a message. To Riot Control, urgent.
Command Post under attack!

01:16:04.695 --> 01:16:07.029
Repeat: Command Post under attack!

01:16:07.114 --> 01:16:09.115
It won't work, sir.

01:16:15.831 --> 01:16:17.039
No!

01:16:20.627 --> 01:16:24.964
But how? How? They don't have
the intelligence to use such tools!

01:16:32.139 --> 01:16:34.599
Shoot them! Shoot them all!

01:16:36.143 --> 01:16:38.352
This is the Communication Center.
We have no defense.

01:16:38.437 --> 01:16:42.273
If we lose this battle,
that's the end of the world as we know it!

01:16:42.357 --> 01:16:45.735
We will have proved
ourselves inferior. Weak!

01:16:45.819 --> 01:16:50.072
And all the groveling cowards left alive
when the battle is over

01:16:50.157 --> 01:16:51.908
will be the weakest of all!

01:16:51.992 --> 01:16:54.702
This will be the end of human civilization

01:16:54.786 --> 01:16:57.872
and the world will belong
to a planet of apes!

01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:34.825
No! No, go. Go!

01:18:06.608 --> 01:18:07.817
Caesar!

01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:13.197
Your servant.

01:18:13.281 --> 01:18:17.326
Your creature. Your animal!

01:18:17.411 --> 01:18:19.537
But I saw you die.

01:18:19.621 --> 01:18:24.875
The king is dead. Long live the king!

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:28.671
Tell me, Breck, before you die,

01:18:28.755 --> 01:18:34.969
how do we differ from the dogs
and cats you and your kind used to love?

01:18:35.053 --> 01:18:39.682
Why did you turn us from pets into slaves?

01:18:39.766 --> 01:18:43.185
Because your kind were once
our ancestors.

01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:45.771
Man was born of the ape.

01:18:45.856 --> 01:18:49.400
And there's still an ape
curled up inside of every man.

01:18:49.484 --> 01:18:53.529
The beast that must be
whipped into submission.

01:18:53.613 --> 01:18:57.533
The savage that has to
be shackled in chains.

01:18:57.617 --> 01:19:01.495
You are that beast, Caesar. You taint us.

01:19:02.664 --> 01:19:06.125
You poison our guts!

01:19:06.209 --> 01:19:08.210
When...

01:19:08.295 --> 01:19:11.047
When we hate you, we're...

01:19:11.131 --> 01:19:14.467
we're hating the dark side of ourselves.

01:19:37.324 --> 01:19:38.657
Take him.

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:42.828
Go!

01:20:52.941 --> 01:20:55.776
Caesar!

01:20:55.861 --> 01:20:59.029
Caesar. This is not how it was to be.

01:21:00.907 --> 01:21:03.450
In your view or mine?

01:21:03.535 --> 01:21:06.662
Violence prolongs hate.
Hate prolongs violence.

01:21:06.746 --> 01:21:09.290
By what right are you spilling blood?

01:21:09.374 --> 01:21:13.169
The slave's right
to punish his persecutors.

01:21:13.253 --> 01:21:18.841
Caesar. I, a descendant of slaves,
am asking you to show humanity.

01:21:18.925 --> 01:21:21.510
But I was not born human.

01:21:21.595 --> 01:21:24.972
I know. The child of the evolved apes.

01:21:25.056 --> 01:21:28.517
Whose children shall rule the Earth.

01:21:28.602 --> 01:21:32.396
For better or for worse?

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:35.024
Do you think it could be worse?

01:21:35.108 --> 01:21:39.361
Do you think this riot
will win freedom for all your kind?

01:21:39.446 --> 01:21:43.407
- By tomorrow...
- By tomorrow, it will be too late.

01:21:43.491 --> 01:21:48.329
A tiny, mindless insect like the emperor
moth can communicate with another

01:21:48.413 --> 01:21:53.584
- over a distance of 80 miles.
- An emperor ape might do slightly better?

01:21:53.668 --> 01:21:55.920
Slightly?

01:21:56.004 --> 01:22:00.799
What you have seen here today,
apes on the five continents

01:22:00.884 --> 01:22:02.551
will be imitating tomorrow.

01:22:02.636 --> 01:22:06.972
With knives against guns? With kerosene
cans against flame-throwers?

01:22:07.057 --> 01:22:10.351
Where there is fire, there is smoke.

01:22:10.435 --> 01:22:14.396
And, in that smoke, from this day forward,

01:22:14.481 --> 01:22:17.983
my people will crouch and conspire

01:22:18.068 --> 01:22:23.239
and plot and plan for
the inevitable day of man's downfall.

01:22:23.323 --> 01:22:27.618
The day when he finally
and self-destructively

01:22:27.702 --> 01:22:30.037
turns his weapons against his own kind.

01:22:30.121 --> 01:22:32.248
The day of the writing in the sky,

01:22:32.332 --> 01:22:36.752
when your cities lie buried
under radioactive rubble.

01:22:36.836 --> 01:22:41.173
When the sea is a dead sea
and the land is a wasteland

01:22:41.258 --> 01:22:46.262
out of which I will lead my people
from their captivity.

01:22:46.346 --> 01:22:51.433
And we shall build our own cities in
which there will be no place for humans,

01:22:51.518 --> 01:22:53.435
except to serve our ends.

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:57.231
And we shall found our own armies,
our own religion,

01:22:57.315 --> 01:22:59.233
our own dynasty!

01:22:59.317 --> 01:23:04.196
And that day is upon you... now!

01:24:06.801 --> 01:24:09.720
But now...

01:24:09.804 --> 01:24:14.183
Now we will put away our hatred.

01:24:14.267 --> 01:24:16.894
Now we will put down our weapons.

01:24:21.107 --> 01:24:25.694
We have passed through
the Night of the Fires.

01:24:25.779 --> 01:24:29.031
And those who were our masters

01:24:29.115 --> 01:24:32.701
are now our servants.

01:24:32.786 --> 01:24:36.705
And we, who are not human,

01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:41.543
can afford to be humane.

01:24:41.628 --> 01:24:44.546
Destiny is the will of God.

01:24:44.631 --> 01:24:49.426
And, if it is man's destiny
to be dominated,

01:24:49.511 --> 01:24:51.887
it is God's will
