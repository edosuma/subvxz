WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:03.705
Previously on Farscape.

00:03.796 --> 00:10.087
I will find them again, and
when I do, they will pay
for this humiliation.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.338
I finally figured out wormholes.

00:11.429 --> 00:14.842
You did it. All that wormhole
nonsense we put up with.

00:14.932 --> 00:18.470
Wormholes are his obsession.

00:18.561 --> 00:20.222
( screaming )

00:20.313 --> 00:23.521
( scream fades )

00:23.608 --> 00:29.649
Wormholes bridge space-time,
creating a unique ability
to navigate.

00:29.739 --> 00:33.607
The moment the Ancients
implanted that knowledge, you
exist to service a larger...

00:33.701 --> 00:36.113
No! No.

00:36.204 --> 00:38.320
What do you desire
with wormholes?

00:38.414 --> 00:41.827
For starters? Go home.

00:46.756 --> 00:49.964
D'Argo? Pilot?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.221
Whoops.

01:03.356 --> 01:05.642
And now on Farscape.

01:08.945 --> 01:10.651
Home.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.946
That really is Kansas.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.790
Pilot, can you hear me?

01:23.668 --> 01:26.205
No, 'course not.

01:31.801 --> 01:34.338
Nothing.

01:34.428 --> 01:38.091
I can't believe I'm
gonna die here.

01:38.182 --> 01:41.549
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

01:41.644 --> 01:43.350
John.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.143
Where are you?

01:45.231 --> 01:46.767
D'Argo?

01:46.857 --> 01:49.234
Crichton:
Son of a bitch!
How can you hear me?

01:49.318 --> 01:51.775
I don't know. The wormhole
keeps opening and closing.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.113
Where are you?

01:53.197 --> 01:56.781
Don't worry about that right
now. Just do exactly what I say.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.732
Follow my instructions.

01:58.828 --> 02:01.035
Lock onto my voice signal.

02:01.122 --> 02:04.364
When the wormhole opens
again, follow it.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.916
D'Argo:
Pilot, I'm leaving Sikozu and
Scorpius on board.

02:08.004 --> 02:09.335
You can't leave fek-face here.

02:09.422 --> 02:10.787
To make sure he doesn't
do anything,

02:10.881 --> 02:13.133
I'd like you to begin to lock
down all the systems.

02:13.217 --> 02:16.084
Beginning power down... now.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.714
The rest of us are going
after Crichton.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.420
Shee-aw.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.183
D'Argo:
Pilot, I don't see any
wormhole out here.

02:24.270 --> 02:29.435
500 bottles of beer on the
wall, 500 bottles of beer,

02:29.525 --> 02:32.232
take one down, pass it around...

02:32.320 --> 02:34.527
Pilot, I'm still not
getting any reading.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.990
The coordinates are exact.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.110
Wait for it.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.576
( explosive whoosh )

02:52.381 --> 02:53.962
(grunts)

02:59.472 --> 03:00.928
(gasping)

03:04.643 --> 03:07.100
Crichton:
...one down, pass it around...

03:07.188 --> 03:09.600
Everybody okay?
-He did it.

03:09.690 --> 03:13.057
...beer on the wall,
6 bottles of beer,
-There he is.

03:13.152 --> 03:14.392
John, we're here. We made it.

03:14.487 --> 03:16.273
Hey, you're early!

03:16.364 --> 03:18.320
I still got a six pack.
Where are ya?

03:18.407 --> 03:20.022
We're coming in behind you.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.494
Turn around and prepare
for immediate retrieval.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.079
All right.

03:30.753 --> 03:33.335
D, I need a radio signal.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.208
Coming in clean, John.
Nothing's locking onto us.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.210
Just need to know
what year it is.

03:37.301 --> 03:39.292
Okay. Got something.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.923
Reporter:
...on the Senate floor.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.755
Commenting from the White House,
President Reagan told reporters

03:43.849 --> 03:46.966
the situation in Nicaragua had
unraveled to such an extent

03:47.061 --> 03:48.597
that the State Department...
-What's the matter?

03:48.687 --> 03:51.303
Reagan was president
in the 1980s.

03:51.399 --> 03:56.018
Einstein said ifl came back
before I left, it would
screw things up.

03:56.112 --> 03:58.228
D, we need to get down there
and check it out.

03:58.322 --> 03:59.277
Okay.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.953
(dog barks in distance)

04:12.044 --> 04:14.251
Home.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.624
I can't believe I'm home.

04:16.715 --> 04:19.798
( motorcycle revs in distance )

04:19.885 --> 04:22.342
Neighbor:
Touchdown!

04:23.556 --> 04:26.343
(child laughing)

04:27.560 --> 04:31.394
D. Keep everybody off Comms
and the ship invisible.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.142
I'm just gonna check
things out.

04:34.233 --> 04:37.020
Einstein said if there was a
problem with the timeline,

04:37.111 --> 04:39.944
it would start close to me.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.155
Oh, Betty.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.157
Dad, Dad, you ready?

04:49.248 --> 04:50.237
Mom!

04:50.332 --> 04:51.663
Hey!

04:51.750 --> 04:53.251
Congratulations, honey.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.291
We're so very proud of you,
aren't we?

04:55.379 --> 04:58.121
Sure are.
-You guys shouldn't have gone
to the trouble.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.170
That looks good.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.340
Give me a kiss. Thank you.

05:01.427 --> 05:02.507
Did you do that?
-Johnny?

05:02.595 --> 05:04.176
Did you do the writing on that?
-Looks pretty nice.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.128
What about the champagne?
Are you gonna open it for us?

05:06.223 --> 05:07.724
I'll get to it, Mom.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.264
That's me.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.637
Son of a gun.
-O|ivia, I can't wait to
have a slice.

05:11.729 --> 05:13.765
You sure we just can't
cut to the cake?

05:13.856 --> 05:18.395
Mission Control:
Liftoff. The 25th Space Shuttle
mission and it has cleared the tower.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.772
Oh, God.

05:23.782 --> 05:28.151
D. I don't know howl did it,
but my dad's going up on
the Challenger.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.987
John, what are you
talking about?

05:31.081 --> 05:36.826
1986. The Challenger space
shuttle exploded, killing
everyone on board.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.959
My dad wasn't on that flight.

05:54.438 --> 05:58.101
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

05:58.192 --> 06:01.855
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

06:01.946 --> 06:03.732
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

06:03.822 --> 06:07.030
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

06:07.117 --> 06:08.857
my friends.

06:09.954 --> 06:11.740
I've made enemies.

06:11.830 --> 06:15.072
Powerful, dangerous.

06:15.167 --> 06:18.659
Now all I want is to
find a way home

06:18.754 --> 06:21.496
to warn Earth.

06:21.590 --> 06:26.675
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

06:57.418 --> 07:01.457
Not to be insensitive, but
in the scheme of things,

07:01.547 --> 07:05.415
well, what does it matter if
your father flies and dies?

07:05.509 --> 07:08.125
My father got me started
in avionics.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.302
No Dad, no Farscape project.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.846
You stay in Peacekeeper custody,
she remains a Nazi,

07:12.933 --> 07:14.343
she ends up on Nebari Prime.

07:14.435 --> 07:17.222
We get it. How do we fix this?

07:17.313 --> 07:20.180
Einstein said the change ripples
out from the first mutation.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.640
We fix that, everything else
falls back into place.

07:22.735 --> 07:25.693
So if you can get your father to
refuse this Challenger flight...

07:25.779 --> 07:29.021
Everything should turn
back to normal.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.356
Look, we can't all stay here.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.157
I don't know how long
this is gonna take.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.360
But I know a place we
might hang out.

07:34.455 --> 07:37.162
And we have one piece of luck.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.207
Tomorrow's Halloween.
-What's that?

07:40.294 --> 07:44.412
Well, that's something that
means you're gonna fit in
just fine, Grandma.

07:48.469 --> 07:51.006
(D'Argo coughing)

07:53.974 --> 07:57.262
The dust on this planet is
playing havoc with my sinuses.

07:57.353 --> 08:00.561
Shee-aw, what's all this?

08:00.648 --> 08:03.390
Crichton:
Cops busted the owner for drugs.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.145
They sealed the place up.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.363
For a while, there were some
gang kids living here.

08:08.447 --> 08:09.607
Drad.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.235
Are those jeans?
Let me see those.

08:12.326 --> 08:13.156
Here.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.074
This is your home?

08:15.162 --> 08:18.154
No, Rygel, it's not my home.

08:18.248 --> 08:21.035
Don't worry, we're only gonna
be here for a couple of arns.

08:21.126 --> 08:26.211
Just gotta find a way to keep
my dad from going on
the Challenger.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.710
Yeah, these'll fit.

08:28.801 --> 08:30.883
Y'all might wanna stay
out of sight.

08:30.969 --> 08:35.679
We don't wanna screw up the
universe any more than
I already have.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.549
Good luck.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.221
(door opens)

08:44.316 --> 08:45.772
Jack:
Get back in here!

08:45.859 --> 08:46.814
Get back here now!

08:46.902 --> 08:48.438
Mom:
Not in the street!

08:48.529 --> 08:49.644
Jack! Johnny!

08:49.738 --> 08:51.114
Go check the Tarot cards, Mom!
-What?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.314
They'll predict he'll walk
all over you again!

08:53.409 --> 08:54.694
Kim:
Stop! Just stop!

08:54.785 --> 08:56.195
Jack:
And | asked you what
I should do.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.947
And then you did exactly
what you wanted!

08:58.038 --> 09:01.246
Can we please move back inside
before the entire neighborhood
calls 9-1-1?

09:01.333 --> 09:03.449
Oh, just shut up, Mom, please.
-Don't you talk to her
like that!

09:05.170 --> 09:07.286
And don't you pretend to care
what I say to her!

09:07.381 --> 09:09.463
You're not being fair, Johnny!
-You shut up, too!

09:09.550 --> 09:13.008
Pal, you're angry with me, so
take it out on me, not on them!

09:13.095 --> 09:15.711
Yo, hero, read the
middle finger.

09:15.806 --> 09:17.342
(engine starting)

09:17.433 --> 09:19.094
Kim:
Johnny!

09:19.184 --> 09:21.049
Wait!
(tires screeching )

09:21.145 --> 09:22.555
Jesus.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.604
What the hell is wrong with
him?! He's so damned angry!

09:25.691 --> 09:27.181
Jack, you know what's wrong.

09:27.276 --> 09:29.267
Well, I'm gonna make
everybody's day!

09:29.361 --> 09:31.477
I won't go Monday.
I'll go tomorrow.

09:31.572 --> 09:34.154
Then you can throw
another party!

09:34.950 --> 09:37.316
Mom:
Come here. Come on.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.332
Milk!

09:48.380 --> 09:50.587
Oh God, milk.

09:54.011 --> 09:55.421
Oh, wow.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.764
What are you doing?

09:58.807 --> 10:01.719
( clears throat)
Just...

10:01.810 --> 10:03.675
just having some milk...

10:03.771 --> 10:05.307
K-Kim.

10:05.397 --> 10:08.104
Do I know you?

10:08.192 --> 10:09.773
I'm Fred.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.350
Fred...

10:11.904 --> 10:14.486
Fred Scarran.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.438
From the Gainesville Scarrans.
We're family.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.615
You do look a little
like Johnny.

10:18.702 --> 10:22.069
| just saw him drive off in
Betty. Where's he going,
thelake?

10:22.164 --> 10:25.406
No, when he gets really steamed
up, he heads down to the canal.

10:25.501 --> 10:26.707
Yeah.
-|t's near...

10:26.794 --> 10:28.876
No, I know where that is.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.213
I like...

10:33.717 --> 10:35.548
that spot...

10:35.636 --> 10:38.218
you know with...
the overhang...

10:38.305 --> 10:42.093
the tall trees.
-That's my favorite place.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.799
Johnny hates it there.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.556
Yeah, I know.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.387
He shouldn't.

10:54.947 --> 10:56.483
Milk?

10:56.573 --> 10:58.655
Does a body good.

11:01.912 --> 11:06.201
D'Argo:
Turn on the lights, or black
out the whole city.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.998
"Made in France."

11:09.086 --> 11:11.748
(grunting)
(zapping)

11:11.839 --> 11:17.709
TV Announcer:
Look at this studio filled
with fabulous prizes. -What the frell is that?

11:17.803 --> 11:19.043
(Chiana giggles)

11:19.137 --> 11:21.469
I have no idea.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.718
This sensational twenty...

11:23.809 --> 11:25.674
What do you think this means?

11:25.769 --> 11:28.977
...beach party showcase.

11:29.064 --> 11:32.181
Well, it must be some kind
of... a greeting.

11:32.276 --> 11:33.607
Yeah, to a friend.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.902
...hundred dollar
strand of pearls.

11:36.989 --> 11:39.355
Hello, Wrinkles.
(laughs)

11:39.449 --> 11:41.861
...thousand dollars just
waiting to be won on....

11:41.952 --> 11:43.613
Wheel of Fortune.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.240
And now here's your host...

11:45.330 --> 11:46.536
Wheel...

11:46.623 --> 11:48.955
( chuckles )

11:52.004 --> 11:54.040
Nice truck.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.333
Betty.

11:56.425 --> 11:57.335
Who are you?

11:57.426 --> 11:59.291
My name's John. John Clarence.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.968
You know, you should go to
the overhang more often.
Kim likes it there.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.261
What the hell are you doing?

12:03.348 --> 12:05.725
Just checking your
suspension, bro.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.424
Need you to do me a favor.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.134
You have to talk to
your father.

12:09.229 --> 12:13.188
I want him not to go up
on the shuttle.

12:13.275 --> 12:17.314
Look, I don't know who you are,
but shove off.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.111
Hey!

12:22.951 --> 12:25.328
Okay, we don't hit.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.119
We may shoot people sometimes,
but we don't hit.

12:28.206 --> 12:33.326
Get off me, you...
-And no, I am not...
You got problems.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.628
You're gonna outgrow most
of 'em. And I know why
you're upset.

12:36.715 --> 12:37.875
You got no idea!

12:37.966 --> 12:40.628
Yes, I do. You think he
treats her badly.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.592
How do you know that?

12:46.683 --> 12:51.302
Same way I know you helped
D.K. cheat on his SATs.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.141
You wanna go to college, boy?

12:55.275 --> 12:58.563
Convince your dad not to
fly on the Challenger.

13:04.368 --> 13:07.155
You're a spook, right?
Coming to test the family?

13:07.245 --> 13:10.783
'Cause if you guys knew
anything, you'd know I can't
convince my dad to do squat.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.865
You're wrong.
-You're wrong.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.246
He never listens.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.579
(tires squeal )

13:21.218 --> 13:23.755
Man, when you're right,
you're right.

13:23.845 --> 13:26.097
Aeryn:
D'Argo, you should study this.

13:26.181 --> 13:29.048
"L, M, N, O, P, Q..."

13:29.142 --> 13:31.133
Just a few of their words.
Just in case.

13:31.228 --> 13:33.389
Chiana has already told me
a few words.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.062
"Yes." "No." "Bite me."
That's all I need to know.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.561
Aeryn:
"R, S..." S.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.017
This girl is slow.

13:40.112 --> 13:42.694
Rygel:
Why are you wearing that?

13:42.781 --> 13:45.488
Come on. Aren't you busting
to get out?

13:45.575 --> 13:46.906
(grunts)

13:46.994 --> 13:49.701
We're on Earth.
It's Crichton's hometown.

13:49.788 --> 13:52.530
D'Argo:
John has told us to stay.
-Again with the Cookie Monster.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.455
Rygel:
Crichton has gotten home.

13:54.543 --> 13:58.161
If you don't screw this up,
maybe one day he can
get me home, too.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.837
Chiana:
I don't wanna wait for one day.
I wanna go exploring now.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.004
Chiana!

14:02.092 --> 14:04.834
I am not permitting you to go.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.338
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to listen.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.170
You're not the captain
down here.

14:08.265 --> 14:09.630
It's Halloween. I'll fit in.

14:09.725 --> 14:12.341
Chiana, no!
-D'Argo, no! Don't go out there!

14:33.874 --> 14:35.114
(warning grunts)

14:35.208 --> 14:37.324
Kermit:
...Q, R, S, T, U, V...

14:37.419 --> 14:38.875
( both gasping )

14:38.962 --> 14:41.328
(Rygel laughing)

14:43.425 --> 14:45.711
Kermit:
...W, X, Y and Z...
-What is this?

14:45.802 --> 14:48.134
(giggles )

14:48.221 --> 14:50.212
Girl:
I love you.

14:50.307 --> 14:52.343
Kermit:
I love you, too.

14:52.434 --> 14:54.891
Uh-oh.

14:54.978 --> 14:58.141
Sikozu:
Pilot, there's no need for
a complete shutdown.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.562
Turn up the heat.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.140
Scorpius. Sikozu.
We've got trouble.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.736
Get up here.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.937
Peacekeeper Marauders are
approaching at maximum speed.

15:07.032 --> 15:10.524
Grayza and Braca are aboard.
-We|l, Starburst.

15:10.619 --> 15:14.953
No, if Moya does, she will
never find this wormhole's
exact location again.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.200
Crichton and the others...

15:16.291 --> 15:17.701
Will be lost.

15:17.793 --> 15:19.658
We must go now.

15:19.753 --> 15:25.214
If you run, Grayza will assume
Crichton is aboard and she
will hunt you down.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.342
We let Grayza board.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.137
She will see Crichton
is not here and...

15:33.225 --> 15:36.217
She will kill me.

15:36.311 --> 15:41.101
If Crichton is not here,
she will not hurt you, Pilot.

15:44.361 --> 15:47.444
(over radio):
...our true love

15:47.531 --> 15:50.944
Dreams that come and go
-Hey, nice outfit.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.319
Goin' to a party?

15:52.410 --> 15:53.741
Yeah.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.494
You wanna lift?

15:57.666 --> 15:58.906
Sure.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.164
You can tell me 'bout
the pain you feel

16:03.255 --> 16:04.540
(chuckling)

16:04.631 --> 16:09.216
...the wounds will
never heal, oh

16:09.302 --> 16:12.465
(music really loud)
'Cause love is blind

16:12.556 --> 16:13.762
You like that?

16:13.849 --> 16:16.090
Don't try to change my mind

16:16.184 --> 16:17.685
Cool. So what's your name?

16:17.769 --> 16:19.009
Chiana.

16:19.104 --> 16:21.095
Was it Karen?
-Love is blind

16:21.189 --> 16:22.520
Yeah.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.019
Yeah, Karen.
-Love is blind

16:25.110 --> 16:27.852
( sizzle )
Shee-aw.

16:27.946 --> 16:30.688
Karen Shaw, right?

16:30.782 --> 16:32.568
The name's John Crichton.

16:32.659 --> 16:36.527
'Cause love is blind

16:36.621 --> 16:38.612
Crichton?
-Love is blind

16:38.707 --> 16:40.288
What's the matter?

16:40.375 --> 16:43.242
Drive. Drive.
-It happens all the time

16:43.336 --> 16:45.372
Drive.
-|t's not a crime

16:45.463 --> 16:50.173
(exuberant yell )
'Cause love is blind

16:53.180 --> 16:57.264
( radio dispatcher noise )

16:59.019 --> 17:01.351
Looks like an enforcer.

17:01.438 --> 17:02.848
He has a weapon.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.145
D'Argo, you should put
this on, too.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.939
Aeryn knows enough English
to get us through.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.188
Just remember the plan.

17:09.279 --> 17:12.567
Plan doesn't work,
we use force.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.943
It'll be fine.

17:18.496 --> 17:19.622
Hello.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.492
Ma'am.

17:21.583 --> 17:24.040
How can I help you?

17:24.127 --> 17:25.833
Uh, well, this house was, uh...

17:25.921 --> 17:29.880
Abandoned by our uncle.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.218
Would you like to come in?

17:32.302 --> 17:33.917
Yeah, thanks.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.468
Oh.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.136
(inhaling)

17:41.311 --> 17:42.801
( door creaks closed )

17:42.896 --> 17:44.557
Officer:
Listen, I'm afraid
I had a, uh...

17:44.648 --> 17:47.685
A complaint from the lady.
Yes, I think she was scared.

17:47.776 --> 17:49.232
She saw Kermit.

17:49.319 --> 17:52.607
We thought the batteries were
dead, but it's just a silly toy.

17:52.697 --> 17:55.074
( belches )

17:55.158 --> 17:57.194
Grandma, say excuse me.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.570
Okay, where are you from?

17:58.662 --> 17:59.993
(sneezes)
-Uh...

18:00.080 --> 18:01.945
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't move, pal!

18:02.040 --> 18:04.247
Aeryn:
It's all right, he's
just my brother.

18:04.334 --> 18:07.167
It's Hallowin, remember?

18:07.254 --> 18:09.415
He's, uh, he's dressed up.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.546
In a mask.

18:11.633 --> 18:12.588
That's a mask?

18:12.676 --> 18:14.416
Aeryn:
Yes, of course it is.

18:14.511 --> 18:19.175
You're a little old to be
dressing up for Halloween,
aren't you, pal?

18:20.558 --> 18:21.889
No.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.514
Yes.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.812
Bite...

18:31.903 --> 18:33.143
...me.

18:33.238 --> 18:36.150
Okay, take off the mask,
pal. Now!

18:37.200 --> 18:40.237
Take off the mask!

18:41.955 --> 18:44.446
Take off the mask!

18:44.541 --> 18:46.202
It's all right, okay.
-Stand back!

18:46.293 --> 18:47.624
Toy sword.
-Excuse me.

18:47.711 --> 18:49.667
( coughs )

18:50.463 --> 18:52.374
(coughing)

18:56.678 --> 18:58.259
(whispers ):
There is no danger here.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.632
See D'Argo remove his mask.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.555
See the hoo-man you expect.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.304
Then go and leave us alone.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.644
Is there a problem, Officer?

19:11.735 --> 19:13.976
Oh, no, no. No problem.

19:15.864 --> 19:19.277
No problem. I'll just, uh...

19:19.367 --> 19:22.200
I'll just go, man, and,
uh... you guys...

19:22.287 --> 19:24.619
You guys... just, uh, you know,
do your own thing.

19:24.706 --> 19:25.616
Happy Hallowin.

19:25.707 --> 19:27.322
Uh-huh.
-Bye-bye.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.157
( groans )

19:29.252 --> 19:31.709
You bitch! I think you
broke a rib.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.502
(groans)
-Shut up.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.505
Well, we've done it now.

19:36.593 --> 19:39.005
I have to go and find Crichton.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.257
Thanks, ma'am.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.308
Okay.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.135
Oh, man. Like those clothes.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.812
I hope this is all right.
It's all we could find.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.185
Well, you kinda look like Cher.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.483
Is that a good or a bad thing?

19:56.321 --> 19:57.151
It works.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.194
How are things going here?

19:59.282 --> 20:01.273
Uh, situation normal.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.108
It's getting worse.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.694
Now my dad's leaving tomorrow.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.668
Mom, I'm going.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.541
Oh, hey...

20:15.632 --> 20:17.543
Are you sure you don't want me
to drive you over?

20:17.634 --> 20:19.545
I'll call you when I get
to Deb's house.

20:19.636 --> 20:20.921
Okay.
-Bye, Mom.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.127
Bye, honey.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.679
Who? What?

20:24.766 --> 20:26.131
That's my mother.

20:26.226 --> 20:30.310
She died four years
before I left.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.598
Now I'm gonna talk to her.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.191
Excuse me, ma'am.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.197
Do I know you?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.414
No. No. I...

20:55.839 --> 20:57.875
You read the cards?

20:59.217 --> 21:01.173
I know it's silly.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.547
Everybody thinks it is,
especially my son.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.845
It's not. He's wrong.

21:06.808 --> 21:10.266
He's just... young.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.349
It's not silly.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.437
It's a little strange.

21:19.696 --> 21:22.654
But tha-that's why
I'm here. Um...

21:22.740 --> 21:26.653
I did a reading in Gainesville,

21:26.744 --> 21:30.157
and I, uh, saw your husband.

21:30.248 --> 21:31.613
Jack?

21:32.292 --> 21:33.748
Yeah.

21:33.835 --> 21:35.791
Don't let him go tomorrow.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.336
Make him stay till Monday.

21:38.423 --> 21:40.334
I did a reading.

21:40.425 --> 21:44.009
I... God...
is there something...

21:44.095 --> 21:48.555
I don't know. Just don't let
him go this weekend. Don't...

21:50.477 --> 21:52.593
Don't back down like
you always do.

21:52.687 --> 21:54.803
How do you know that?

21:58.443 --> 22:00.684
It's in your face.

22:02.363 --> 22:06.106
You're a peacemaker.
Not a fighter.

22:07.368 --> 22:09.529
Look, just... just don't
let him go.

22:09.621 --> 22:12.328
I'm sorry I bothered you.
-Wait.

22:12.415 --> 22:15.122
Are you sure I don't know you?

22:17.378 --> 22:19.414
No.

22:19.506 --> 22:22.543
You don't know me.

22:22.634 --> 22:24.340
"It even brought tears
to my eyes..."

22:24.427 --> 22:27.885
Rygel:
Just tell your father about the
crash and he won't go on the scuttle.

22:27.972 --> 22:31.135
Shuttle. No, he probably
wouldn't believe me.
It'd just make things worse.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.467
What do you wanna do?

22:33.561 --> 22:36.098
17 years ago, I got
trapped in a fire.

22:36.189 --> 22:38.271
I was in a coma for two days.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.144
My dad saved me.

22:40.235 --> 22:43.477
Afterwards, when NASA called,
he refused to leave.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.687
And you want to recreate that?

22:45.782 --> 22:48.194
I wanna get as close as I can.

22:48.284 --> 22:53.153
I'll get my old girlfriend to
bring my... self here.

22:53.248 --> 22:55.409
We'll make sure my dad
saves me, light a fire.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.615
I can help.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.245
I can simulate a coma so...

22:58.336 --> 23:01.453
No, no, no, no, Grandma.
You do not touch my body.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.794
Where's Chiana?

23:05.885 --> 23:09.252
Yeah, we used to get along.
We did stuff.

23:09.347 --> 23:12.635
Now he just thinks we're part
of his crew or something.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.970
Fathers.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.097
You got trouble with yours?

23:18.231 --> 23:19.391
Yeah.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.433
The joke is...

23:25.071 --> 23:27.153
I wanna go up there,
too, one day.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.864
You will.

23:32.287 --> 23:35.074
Nah, it's too tough.
It's a total bitch.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.325
They only take the best.

23:40.378 --> 23:44.087
I don't know. Maybe. One day.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.306
Hello, Cookie Monster.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.422
What are you doing?

24:30.136 --> 24:31.797
He was snooping.

24:31.888 --> 24:36.177
I'm running tests to make sure
I don't hurt Crichton if I put
him into a coma.

24:36.267 --> 24:37.382
Look...

24:38.269 --> 24:40.806
I can do anything to him.

24:40.897 --> 24:43.809
He doesn't feel a thing.
-Crichton told us not to
make things worse.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.481
Get him out of there.

24:47.904 --> 24:49.360
Get him in.

24:52.241 --> 24:52.946
Helmet.

24:53.034 --> 24:54.695
( groans )

24:54.786 --> 24:56.242
Nearly lost him.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.695
Machine. Go.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.494
I think you might turn that.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.667
It's all right.
Mind your own business.

25:04.754 --> 25:07.461
(engine starts)
Okay, prepare for engagement.

25:07.548 --> 25:10.631
(tires screeching )

25:10.718 --> 25:13.380
(garbage cans crash )

25:14.305 --> 25:16.011
Excuse me.

25:17.475 --> 25:18.965
Uh...

25:22.063 --> 25:23.769
( screeching )

25:27.068 --> 25:30.435
( screeching continues )

25:39.956 --> 25:41.196
Activate the control collar.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.542
Moya doesn't want a
control collar.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.742
Please, we didn't try to run.

25:45.837 --> 25:47.668
We didn't St-Starburst.

25:47.755 --> 25:51.373
I told you I... I have no idea
where Crichton is.

25:51.467 --> 25:56.336
Braca, if Crichton is aboard
this Leviathan, bring him to me.

25:56.431 --> 25:57.796
Yes, ma'am.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.506
Commence a full tier search.

26:00.601 --> 26:02.933
I'll start in the
Neural Cluster.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.687
( Rygel chuckling )

26:11.738 --> 26:13.478
Well, I arranged it with Kim.

26:13.573 --> 26:17.111
I'm gonna meet my young self
at the canal tomorrow.

26:17.785 --> 26:19.321
What are you doing?

26:19.412 --> 26:21.494
Cutting. Just cutting.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.617
Make them scary, you said.

26:23.708 --> 26:28.122
Scary. Ooh.
-Hell, somebody got
a sugar high.

26:28.212 --> 26:30.749
You've been stealing candy,
Mr. Burroughs?

26:30.840 --> 26:33.877
Oh Crichton, how illegal
is this dren?

26:33.968 --> 26:36.710
You gotta get me more!
I don't care what it costs.

26:36.804 --> 26:39.921
Buckwheat, breathe. Breathe.

26:40.016 --> 26:43.179
Get some sleep.
You've got a big day tomorrow.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.930
Okay, okay.

26:45.021 --> 26:46.886
Good idea.

26:48.483 --> 26:50.474
The Neural Turbines.

26:50.568 --> 26:53.560
They will hide our heat
signatures.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.315
You go.

26:55.406 --> 26:59.399
Scorpius, we must hide until
the Peacekeepers have gone.

26:59.494 --> 27:01.325
I'll be fine.

27:01.412 --> 27:03.118
Go.

27:10.046 --> 27:11.001
Braca:
Check Tier Nine.

27:11.088 --> 27:12.339
Yes, sir.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.123
I'll go below.

27:18.221 --> 27:21.133
(footsteps approaching )

27:25.102 --> 27:27.844
( growls )

27:28.314 --> 27:29.929
You...

27:30.608 --> 27:32.644
you're dead.

27:34.654 --> 27:37.396
How many aboard the
Leviathan, Braca?

27:38.449 --> 27:40.360
30 Peacekeepers...

27:40.451 --> 27:42.942
and Grayza.

27:43.037 --> 27:45.449
Will they follow you down here?

27:45.540 --> 27:47.405
No.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.626
Lieuten...

27:54.799 --> 27:56.755
I mean, Captain.

28:04.225 --> 28:06.216
Well done.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.227
It's good to see you, sir.

28:14.402 --> 28:16.734
(birds singing)

28:17.697 --> 28:20.234
Radio Announcer:
Good morning, Florida!

28:20.324 --> 28:22.940
I hope you having a very
scary Halloween.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.571
(mimics spooky sounds)

28:24.662 --> 28:26.152
Deputy:
Chief.

28:26.247 --> 28:29.330
We've been looking for
you all night.

28:30.710 --> 28:33.372
I saw you with them.

28:33.462 --> 28:36.499
I don't know what you saw, Dot.

28:42.430 --> 28:45.297
The charges are almost ready.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.507
It'll create more smoke
than fire.

28:47.602 --> 28:51.345
Your father will have a quarter
of an am to get you out.

28:51.439 --> 28:53.725
I'll set a perimeter. Make sure
we're not interrupted.

28:53.816 --> 28:57.775
And I've made enough syrup to
keep the kid unconscious
for three arns.

28:57.862 --> 29:00.148
Oh, don't worry, I've tested
it on the enforcer

29:00.239 --> 29:02.400
so the boy won't wake in the
middle of the rescue.

29:02.491 --> 29:08.282
We'll see. I'll go get my...
self, and I'll be right back.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.874
Mmm. You smell nice.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.341
Leslie:
Thank you.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.381
Jack:
Well, what do the cards say?

29:21.469 --> 29:25.678
(chuckling):
Oh, you're definitely staying.

29:27.141 --> 29:29.348
Crichton:
They look happy.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.346
I didn't see my parents
like that very often.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.519
Leslie:
Now you pick one?
-This better be good.

29:33.606 --> 29:36.894
I never saw that in my sires.

29:36.984 --> 29:38.224
( laughter and chatter)

29:38.319 --> 29:40.560
Definitely.
-Oh, no, no.

29:40.655 --> 29:43.067
You just want 'em to stay
like that.

29:43.157 --> 29:46.695
You know, they think they got
all the time in the world.

29:46.786 --> 29:50.324
But pretty soon, it's doctors.
Tests...

29:50.414 --> 29:52.120
(laughter continuing)

29:52.208 --> 29:54.449
Jack:
Well, this one isn't too bad.

30:07.306 --> 30:08.591
Hi, I did what you told me.

30:08.683 --> 30:11.516
Johnny doesn't wanna be here,
but I told him we had to talk.

30:11.602 --> 30:13.638
He thinks I'm breaking up
with him.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.469
Yeah, well you will.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.225
What did you say?

30:18.192 --> 30:20.274
Nothing. lt'sjust...

30:20.361 --> 30:23.068
You know, a girl like you.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.407
Are you flirting with me?

30:25.491 --> 30:27.402
Oh, no. Why would I do that?

30:27.493 --> 30:28.573
No, I'm just...

30:28.661 --> 30:30.071
Hey!

30:30.162 --> 30:31.242
Whoa!

30:31.330 --> 30:33.321
What the hell did you
do that for?

30:33.416 --> 30:35.281
We're in a hurry.

30:36.085 --> 30:38.201
So...

30:38.295 --> 30:40.627
this is what...
what you're into.

30:40.715 --> 30:42.205
She's a nice girl.

30:42.299 --> 30:43.505
( scoffs )

30:43.592 --> 30:45.799
Well, if she's really
that nice,

30:45.886 --> 30:50.926
how about you take care of her
and, uh, I'll take care of him?

30:51.017 --> 30:53.178
No questions asked.

30:56.230 --> 30:58.516
Trick or treat! Trick or treat!
-Come in.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.984
Trick or treat!
-Over here.

31:01.068 --> 31:03.445
Trick or treat, money or eat.

31:06.824 --> 31:08.610
Cool toy.

31:08.701 --> 31:10.237
(growling)

31:10.327 --> 31:12.659
( screaming )

31:12.747 --> 31:15.363
I did it. I got candy.
I got it!

31:15.458 --> 31:17.164
What the hell?

31:17.251 --> 31:19.993
Rygel! Stop doing that!

31:20.087 --> 31:23.955
But I love this, and you-you...
you won't buy me anymore.

31:24.050 --> 31:27.213
I want Kit Kat and
M&M's and Pez

31:27.303 --> 31:29.168
and Reeses Pieces!

31:29.263 --> 31:30.378
Crichton, please!

31:30.473 --> 31:31.713
D, you're all set?

31:31.807 --> 31:35.015
Yeah, I'm just priming the
last charge.

31:35.102 --> 31:37.138
Chiana:
Hey, Norati.

31:37.229 --> 31:40.312
How much longer till...
till the syrup's ready?

31:41.650 --> 31:43.436
Half an arn.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.563
Can you keep him occupied?

31:45.654 --> 31:47.360
I'll think of something.

31:47.448 --> 31:49.404
I'm sure you can, hmm.

31:51.202 --> 31:53.113
Okay.

31:53.204 --> 31:54.944
Garage.

31:55.039 --> 31:57.496
Yeah.
-Yeah.

31:59.627 --> 32:01.288
This...

32:01.921 --> 32:05.505
your... first?

32:08.803 --> 32:11.385
Is this how you....

32:11.472 --> 32:13.929
you imagined it?

32:15.267 --> 32:17.349
Not in Betty.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.303
I always thought it would be in
my dad's four-wheel drive.

32:27.363 --> 32:29.524
Scorpius:
Does Grayza know you're my spy?

32:29.615 --> 32:34.359
No. But she'll figure it out
when she discovers you're alive.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.409
She must never find that out.

32:36.497 --> 32:37.953
We've got to stop her.

32:38.040 --> 32:41.123
She's organizing a Peace
Initiative with the Scarrans.

32:41.210 --> 32:43.246
They're using her.

32:43.337 --> 32:49.207
They'll agree to everything,
then betray us, when their
forces are battle ready.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.254
What shall I do?

32:51.345 --> 32:54.428
Stall her, Braca.

32:54.515 --> 32:57.723
I'm not given to
exaggeration, but...

32:57.810 --> 33:01.348
the future of Peacekeeper
survival depends on you.

33:04.441 --> 33:06.181
I got the warrant.

33:06.277 --> 33:08.268
Let's go search that house.

33:13.450 --> 33:16.908
(car race playing on TV)

33:23.210 --> 33:25.747
(whispering ):
Everything is set.
You can do this?

33:25.838 --> 33:27.328
No problem.

33:27.423 --> 33:31.257
Just make sure everyone stays
out of sight until he drinks it.

33:36.974 --> 33:38.134
Hey.

33:38.225 --> 33:39.260
Hey.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.511
Here.

33:45.399 --> 33:47.185
It's okay?

33:47.276 --> 33:48.766
Yeah.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.861
Aeryn:
We've got trouble.
Two enforcers.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.283
Stay down!

33:58.370 --> 34:00.235
Hang on! You're the guy that...
(gagging )

34:00.331 --> 34:01.491
Chiana, keep him down!

34:01.582 --> 34:03.538
( choking )

34:03.626 --> 34:05.162
Crichton?
-What's happening?

34:05.252 --> 34:06.788
Crichton!
-What's the matter?

34:06.879 --> 34:07.959
Old woman!

34:08.047 --> 34:09.207
Hey.
-I thought she tested the stuff.

34:09.298 --> 34:11.880
Is this supposed to
be happening?

34:11.967 --> 34:13.298
No pulse.

34:13.385 --> 34:14.636
I've got no pulse!

34:14.720 --> 34:17.803
(pounding on door)
This is the police! Open up!

34:17.890 --> 34:19.255
Crichton...

34:19.350 --> 34:21.136
Crichton, I know...
-What?!

34:21.227 --> 34:22.467
Your arm.
-Police. Open the door.

34:22.561 --> 34:25.143
We have a warrant to search
these premises.

34:25.231 --> 34:27.688
(pounding on door)
Open up the door!

34:30.361 --> 34:32.147
Police:
Open the door.
This is the police.

34:32.238 --> 34:33.193
Where's Crichton?

34:33.280 --> 34:34.986
Crichton:
I'm here. I've disappeared.

34:35.074 --> 34:36.780
Calm down.
Everything's under control.

34:36.867 --> 34:38.732
Under control? I'm gone!

34:38.827 --> 34:40.363
What happens next,
I lose my voice?

34:40.454 --> 34:42.991
I wish. Keep your...
Keep it down.
-This is the police. Open up.

34:43.082 --> 34:46.449
The Sheriff's body weight
must be greater so I gave
the boy too much.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.374
Bring me back!
-Just bring him back.

34:48.462 --> 34:53.627
His body has stopped functioning
and you are ceasing, wherever
you are, to exist.

34:53.717 --> 34:56.379
We're gonna have to let
them in. Are you ready?

34:56.470 --> 34:58.176
Yeah.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.676
Two of them.
You take the big one.
-Yeah.

35:05.062 --> 35:06.302
Hello.
-Ma'am.

35:08.065 --> 35:09.225
Hey!

35:12.444 --> 35:14.435
Crichton:
Grandma, fix me.

35:14.530 --> 35:17.317
You're just a nooky.
Haven't you ever died before?

35:17.408 --> 35:19.194
Move.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.030
What are you doing?

35:26.125 --> 35:28.081
(gasps )

35:28.502 --> 35:29.958
Hey, is that it?

35:30.045 --> 35:33.458
See? Nothing to worry about.
-Then why am I like this?

35:33.549 --> 35:37.041
Well, I couldn't bring him
back too quickly so I
don't really know,

35:37.136 --> 35:39.843
but I think your
semi-corporeality
won't last long,

35:39.930 --> 35:44.264
so why don't you use your
condition to our advantage.

35:44.351 --> 35:47.434
Fine. I'll go get my dad.

35:47.521 --> 35:50.137
I'm Casper the friggin' joke.

35:58.407 --> 36:00.318
Who are you people?

36:02.411 --> 36:04.197
Aliens.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.042
I'm gonna set the charges
for the smoke.

36:09.126 --> 36:10.957
Right. Let's get him
into the garage.

36:12.546 --> 36:14.832
(humming tune)

36:36.945 --> 36:40.688
Mom... it's me.

36:41.283 --> 36:43.239
Johnny?

36:44.286 --> 36:46.402
I love you.

36:47.831 --> 36:51.323
I've wanted to tell you that
for a very long time.

36:52.795 --> 36:55.286
What's the matter?

36:55.381 --> 36:57.121
I'm in trouble.

36:57.216 --> 37:01.084
I'm in the Carson house. Get Dad
and tell him to save me.

37:01.178 --> 37:03.089
Jack! Jack!

37:03.180 --> 37:04.920
Mom, listen.

37:05.015 --> 37:07.882
When you first feel the
pain, don't...

37:11.438 --> 37:13.429
don't wait.

37:15.401 --> 37:18.234
Braca:
The initial scans were accurate.
The Leviathan is empty.

37:18.320 --> 37:21.403
Grayza:
I assumed as much.
I accessed the memory banks.

37:21.490 --> 37:24.607
The Pilot has no idea where
Crichton's gone.

37:24.701 --> 37:27.158
Braca, prepare the Marauders.

37:27.246 --> 37:29.237
Set course for our meeting
with the Scarrans.

37:29.331 --> 37:31.367
Yes, ma'am.

37:32.209 --> 37:34.575
You two, come with me.

37:38.799 --> 37:41.256
( snarling )

37:42.511 --> 37:46.220
There's no way that Moya can
detect your presence.

37:49.143 --> 37:55.139
But Crichton's DNA, which I
provided for you, will enable
you to detect his presence.

37:56.400 --> 38:02.737
So when he returns, as we know
he will, capture him alive.

38:11.206 --> 38:13.822
Remember nothing.

38:14.209 --> 38:15.949
Hurry.

38:19.256 --> 38:22.714
Except for Karen Shaw,
in the four-wheel drive.

38:33.312 --> 38:34.768
Okay, we gotta go.

38:34.855 --> 38:37.312
Hey, Wrinkles, no, no, no.
It's time to go.

38:37.399 --> 38:40.766
No. The sheriff must forget.
He must.
-No, they're coming. Come on.

38:50.245 --> 38:51.906
ls everyone else back
on the ship?

38:51.997 --> 38:54.409
Yes. Jack's on his way.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.373
John?!

38:58.378 --> 38:59.754
John?

39:02.633 --> 39:03.998
John!

39:04.092 --> 39:05.423
Johnny!

39:06.512 --> 39:08.594
Damn, he moves fast
for an old guy.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.760
You're back.

39:09.848 --> 39:13.215
Yeah, in more ways than one.
-He|lo?

39:13.310 --> 39:17.098
Damn. She's gonna screw
things up. My dad has to
do it by himself.

39:17.189 --> 39:18.429
Aeryn.

39:20.817 --> 39:22.068
John?

39:22.152 --> 39:24.734
Where are you?
John, are you here?

39:24.821 --> 39:26.436
John?

39:31.328 --> 39:34.946
D'Argo:
You know, if he stays in there
too much longer it's gonna catch on fire.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.122
Why do our plans never work?

39:37.209 --> 39:38.790
Murphy's Law.

39:44.466 --> 39:46.832
Son of a... D!

39:50.055 --> 39:51.966
I'm gonna get myself.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.843
You take Dad.

39:59.398 --> 40:01.229
You all right?

40:01.316 --> 40:03.398
I'm still here.

40:12.953 --> 40:15.660
Try not to frown so much.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.203
Good luck.

40:27.301 --> 40:29.166
We've gotta go.
I'll start Lo'La.

40:29.261 --> 40:31.377
Yeah. All right.

40:40.439 --> 40:43.397
(distant siren wailing)

40:46.486 --> 40:47.692
John!

40:47.779 --> 40:50.270
Come on, pal. Breathe.

40:50.365 --> 40:53.357
Breathe. You're gonna be okay.

40:54.536 --> 40:58.279
Jack?! Johnny!
-Talk to me. Come on.

40:58.373 --> 41:01.160
He's all right. He's okay.

41:02.586 --> 41:05.373
I think it's time to go.

41:06.340 --> 41:09.958
Kim:
Johnny? Johnny, you okay?

41:43.627 --> 41:47.836
I got no idea why nobody
else remembers.

41:49.299 --> 41:52.883
I swear to God, I'm telling
the truth.

41:53.887 --> 41:56.128
There was, um...

41:56.223 --> 41:59.886
this guy and he was invisible.

41:59.976 --> 42:04.265
And, um, this other thing that
had this long tongue.

42:04.356 --> 42:07.439
He knocked me out with it.

42:09.444 --> 42:12.060
And they left this...

42:12.781 --> 42:14.942
Um... It's as a sign.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.524
This has gotta...

42:17.619 --> 42:19.826
...be like a message
or something.

42:19.913 --> 42:23.531
'Cause no human could
have made this.

42:25.502 --> 42:29.211
There's no way a human
could have made this.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.422
How is everything else
on your planet?

42:36.513 --> 42:38.378
We did okay.

42:38.473 --> 42:41.965
Is there any way we can save
those people going aboard
that doomed shuttle?

42:42.561 --> 42:44.142
No.

42:44.229 --> 42:46.185
Time must play out.

42:46.273 --> 42:47.888
( static )

42:47.983 --> 42:49.393
Pilot:
Crichton.

42:49.484 --> 42:50.690
Can you hear me?

42:50.777 --> 42:52.233
Yes, Pilot. Where are you?

42:52.320 --> 42:55.278
Where you said to be.

42:55.365 --> 42:58.357
Well, we're scanning now
and you're not here.

42:58.452 --> 42:59.737
Yes, we are.

42:59.828 --> 43:01.159
No, you're not.

43:01.246 --> 43:04.079
Pilot, listen up,
this is important.

43:04.166 --> 43:06.202
What year is it where you are?

43:06.293 --> 43:11.162
Transmission from your Earth
indicates it's 2003.

43:11.256 --> 43:13.463
Follow my signal.

43:13.550 --> 43:16.292
Commander, come home.

43:16.386 --> 43:18.718
Okay, I'm locking on now.

43:18.805 --> 43:20.761
Here it comes.

43:37.324 --> 43:40.236
By Lanet, another Earth.

43:41.620 --> 43:45.579
No. Same Earth, Sparky,
just a different year.

44:23.954 --> 44:26.445
Welcome home, son.

44:27.999 --> 44:31.241
We've been waiting for
you a long time.

44:37.717 --> 44:39.753
What's wrong, John?

44:46.768 --> 44:50.977
Was it a bass or a trout?
