Previously in Z Nation.

00:03.156 --> 00:05.290
I call it the Z Whacker.

00:06.926 --> 00:08.260
Look, I just don't trust Murphy, okay?

00:08.294 --> 00:09.661
There's something wrong with that dude.

00:09.696 --> 00:10.762
What if it's true?

00:10.797 --> 00:12.064
What if Murphy's who they say he is

00:12.098 --> 00:13.232
and there's a chance for a vaccine?

00:13.266 --> 00:14.132
Cuz that's hope, Mack.

00:15.935 --> 00:17.903
It's not hope. It's a lie,
and it's gonna get us both killed.

00:17.937 --> 00:19.805
Well then I'd rather die believing in a lie

00:19.839 --> 00:21.340
than live believing in nothing.

01:34.780 --> 01:38.416
I'm so tired I could sleep
for a thousand years.

01:38.450 --> 01:40.818
Let's just camp here, yeah?

01:42.187 --> 01:43.421
We should get moving.

01:43.455 --> 01:45.456
Why can't we stay here?

01:45.491 --> 01:48.593
We're probably two days out from
the rendezvous. Maybe three.

01:48.627 --> 01:51.429
This may be our last chance
to sync up with the others.

01:51.463 --> 01:53.698
Yeah well I hope Z gets it right this time.

01:53.732 --> 01:55.600
Well we went

01:55.634 --> 01:56.668
south.

01:58.437 --> 02:01.239
They went west.

02:01.273 --> 02:03.641
Hopefully we'll hook up
somewhere in the middle.

02:03.976 --> 02:06.744
We got to angle west.

02:09.815 --> 02:12.216
West is that way. California's that way.

02:12.251 --> 02:13.551
If it's still there.

02:15.554 --> 02:17.388
Well if we can power up somewhere

02:17.423 --> 02:19.657
I can try to get in touch with Z.

02:19.692 --> 02:22.694
See if maybe I can get an
update on their location.

02:23.962 --> 02:26.497
I sorta envy that dude.

02:27.066 --> 02:29.367
So far away from all this.

02:29.968 --> 02:31.803
Yeah, and all alone.

02:33.706 --> 02:36.274
We're gonna go west.

02:36.308 --> 02:37.542
We're gonna meet up with the team.

02:37.576 --> 02:39.510
We're gonna get Murphy to that lab,

02:39.545 --> 02:42.580
and then we are going to cure this virus.

02:44.316 --> 02:46.584
That's a <i> lot</i> of stuff we're doing.

02:46.952 --> 02:48.186
It sure is.

02:48.220 --> 02:50.988
What about some of the
things we aren't doing?

02:51.623 --> 02:53.057
What do you mean?

02:53.759 --> 02:57.895
Like talking, for starters.

02:58.230 --> 03:01.199
Lately it seems like you
can't even look at me.

03:01.300 --> 03:03.201
Like right now.

03:05.404 --> 03:07.171
Addy,

03:07.439 --> 03:08.573
what's going on?

03:08.607 --> 03:11.943
I told you, Mack.
I'm working through it, okay?

03:14.680 --> 03:17.148
It's a big knot that

03:17.182 --> 03:19.617
I'm just not sure I want to untie right now.

03:20.119 --> 03:22.086
Not everything is about you.

03:23.522 --> 03:26.858
It's really beautiful.
Can we just stay here please?

03:28.794 --> 03:30.728
Beauty attracts trouble.

03:30.763 --> 03:31.929
You should know that.

04:35.060 --> 04:36.627
Okay.

04:36.662 --> 04:39.964
We should've stayed at the... at the creek.

04:39.998 --> 04:42.867
Thought we'd get farther on the gas.
That's on me. All right?

04:46.004 --> 04:48.039
Addy, what are you looking at?

04:51.410 --> 04:53.211
You okay?

04:59.184 --> 05:00.585
Addy?

05:01.620 --> 05:02.787
You okay?

05:03.021 --> 05:03.988
Hmmm?

05:04.356 --> 05:06.390
What?

05:32.051 --> 05:34.185
It's like you go somewhere.

05:35.221 --> 05:37.389
I mean what is it you see exactly?

05:37.423 --> 05:38.723
Mack, I'm too tired for this.

05:38.758 --> 05:39.524
Addy.

05:39.558 --> 05:40.658
Mack.

05:40.693 --> 05:42.594
We need to talk about when
you drift off like this.

05:42.628 --> 05:45.063
I mean obviously something
is tearing you up.

05:46.298 --> 05:48.266
I might be able to help if I
knew what you were dealing with,

05:48.300 --> 05:50.201
but you keep shutting me out.

05:54.140 --> 05:55.373
Okay.

05:56.675 --> 05:58.376
Okay.

06:01.447 --> 06:04.382
It's a memory, I think.

06:05.885 --> 06:07.218
I don't know what triggers it,

06:07.253 --> 06:10.455
but whenever it happens it's like...

06:10.489 --> 06:13.391
it's like I go somewhere where I've been.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.828
And when I try to remember, it just

06:16.862 --> 06:19.297
it gets further and further away.

06:20.299 --> 06:22.200
What do you see?

06:23.936 --> 06:26.137
It's the same thing.
It's over and over again.

06:27.973 --> 06:28.807
It's dark.

06:28.841 --> 06:31.876
There's... there's like a light.

06:31.911 --> 06:33.078
And then a Z.

06:33.279 --> 06:35.313
Like a really bad one.

06:35.347 --> 06:36.781
And it's fighting.

06:37.783 --> 06:39.617
Who's it fighting?

06:41.987 --> 06:43.521
I don't know.

06:47.159 --> 06:48.426
Maybe you.

06:51.263 --> 06:52.931
Me, huh?

06:53.032 --> 06:55.366
Yeah, I can never make that part out. But

06:55.401 --> 06:58.670
the Z will not die.

07:02.174 --> 07:05.710
Can we... I'm sorry,
can we talk about something else?

07:05.744 --> 07:06.778
Okay.

07:08.114 --> 07:08.913
Sure, babe.

07:11.317 --> 07:13.551
What would you like to talk about?

07:13.586 --> 07:16.621
We're not talking about me. Talk about you.

07:18.124 --> 07:20.492
This is probably gonna
be a short conversation.

07:20.526 --> 07:22.627
I'll keep it going with questions.

07:22.661 --> 07:25.430
Ummm, okay. What...

07:25.464 --> 07:28.666
If you could do anything,
what would you do right now?

07:29.368 --> 07:31.970
Besides the obvious. What would you do?

07:42.414 --> 07:43.781
I'll tell you exactly what I would do.

07:46.252 --> 07:47.719
I would

07:48.154 --> 07:49.721
take you out

07:50.456 --> 07:53.091
to a great restaurant.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.826
The best in town.

07:54.860 --> 07:56.194
I mean dress up.

07:56.228 --> 07:57.295
Shower.

07:58.164 --> 08:00.498
Whole package, the whole deal.

08:01.133 --> 08:06.337
I would open the doors for you.
I would pull out your chair.

08:06.639 --> 08:10.375
We'd order some wine.

08:10.409 --> 08:13.645
Have a great meal.

08:13.679 --> 08:15.246
Order some more wine.

08:15.281 --> 08:17.715
And then I would just...

08:17.750 --> 08:22.020
I would just stare into your
beautiful eyes all night

08:22.054 --> 08:24.889
and listen to you talk about yourself.

08:24.924 --> 08:30.161
Then we'd go back to
our <i>fabulous</i> pad and...

08:38.470 --> 08:41.773
We never stood a chance, Mack.

08:43.142 --> 08:44.107
Whoa.

08:44.743 --> 08:45.777
Whoa.

08:46.278 --> 08:47.679
Hold on.

08:48.314 --> 08:50.215
What are you saying to me?

08:51.750 --> 08:53.551
Think about it, like

08:55.187 --> 08:57.956
our relationship. What's it based on?

08:58.090 --> 09:00.625
Do we even have anything in common?

09:03.896 --> 09:05.630
We're alive.

09:05.764 --> 09:07.565
How's that for starters?

09:08.334 --> 09:10.501
Yeah, but that's about it.

09:11.003 --> 09:13.805
We met on the first night of the outbreak.

09:14.206 --> 09:16.341
We don't even know each other.

09:16.942 --> 09:21.713
All we know is zombies and mayhem.

09:24.750 --> 09:27.819
Addy, we've kept each other alive.

09:29.054 --> 09:30.688
I mean no matter how bad it's gotten,

09:30.723 --> 09:33.024
we've been there for each other.

09:34.526 --> 09:40.898
That's so much more of a bond
than any <i> ring</i> could give us.

09:40.933 --> 09:41.733
Yeah, but...

09:43.335 --> 09:45.903
we're <i> trauma</i> bonded.

09:46.138 --> 09:47.505
We kill together,

09:48.207 --> 09:50.108
we survive together, and

09:50.776 --> 09:52.043
we have sex together.

09:52.077 --> 09:54.579
But that's it. That's all we have.

09:57.449 --> 09:59.250
Yeah, we met on night one.

09:59.285 --> 10:01.386
And I don't even remember that night really.
Like

10:01.420 --> 10:04.756
for me it's just one blur of...

10:04.790 --> 10:05.390
Okay.

10:05.424 --> 10:05.957
Madness.

10:05.991 --> 10:08.259
Yeah, yeah. I mean

10:09.428 --> 10:11.396
that was bad, and and

10:11.430 --> 10:13.564
we got a lot of bad shit to go through

10:13.599 --> 10:16.501
before this is all over. But Addy,

10:18.404 --> 10:21.439
I need you.
I don't know what you're talking about, we...

10:21.473 --> 10:23.641
we never had a chance.
What do you mean by that?

10:23.676 --> 10:26.110
I mean, babe, in three years

10:26.145 --> 10:29.380
we have never thought about
anything past tomorrow.

10:30.749 --> 10:32.517
You know until this

10:33.185 --> 10:36.354
crazy mission came about, which you know is

10:36.388 --> 10:39.490
probably done as far as we're concerned.

10:39.525 --> 10:41.526
That doesn't mean we're done.

10:42.695 --> 10:45.229
Yeah, but who are we kidding? What...

10:45.964 --> 10:48.399
what kind of future do you and I have?

10:48.567 --> 10:50.635
What are we gonna do?

10:50.669 --> 10:53.171
We gonna get married? Have some kids?

10:54.406 --> 10:56.407
You can't even think about that stuff.

10:56.442 --> 10:58.743
It's crazy. It's impossible.

11:04.316 --> 11:05.883
We have each other.

11:10.823 --> 11:12.757
We've never been on a date.

11:15.961 --> 11:17.462
No?

11:17.496 --> 11:19.030
That's not gonna cut it.

11:23.402 --> 11:24.402
Okay.

11:24.737 --> 11:28.072
Stop.

11:30.309 --> 11:32.410
Addison.

11:33.912 --> 11:35.113
Do you have a middle name?

11:36.515 --> 11:38.950
Yeah, I got a middle name.

11:39.918 --> 11:41.319
What is it?

11:43.222 --> 11:44.689
It's Grace.

11:46.024 --> 11:48.025
Of course it is.

11:50.763 --> 11:56.234
Addison Grace Carver,
will you go out with me?

11:57.202 --> 11:58.002
On a date?

11:58.036 --> 12:00.371
Mack. I promise we won't kill a thing.

12:00.406 --> 12:02.540
Okay. Shhh. You know what...

12:02.574 --> 12:06.210
You just sit here and look pretty.
Don't go anywhere.

12:06.578 --> 12:08.613
Where am I gonna go?

12:21.427 --> 12:26.297
All right, Addy. You wanted a date?
Here is our first date.

12:27.266 --> 12:28.166
No.

12:28.267 --> 12:29.767
Addy?

12:30.602 --> 12:32.270
Addy?

12:34.239 --> 12:38.843
All right, that's fine.
You go ahead and get your sleep.

12:40.112 --> 12:43.080
It's been a long apocalypse.

12:53.025 --> 12:55.026

<i>Mack!</i>

13:13.178 --> 13:14.178
Addy?

13:15.914 --> 13:17.782
Addy, you in here?

13:44.176 --> 13:45.843
Addy?

14:01.627 --> 14:03.528
What the hell?

14:09.301 --> 14:11.168
Are those bites?

14:13.906 --> 14:16.941
What bites a zombie?

14:48.840 --> 14:49.807
Addy.

14:56.982 --> 14:57.982
Addy?

14:59.117 --> 15:01.686
Please tell me you did a
hit and run on this bastard!

15:02.854 --> 15:03.955
Damn, dude.

15:05.390 --> 15:07.458
Freaking Andre the Giant. Addy!

15:10.095 --> 15:11.429
All right.

15:16.001 --> 15:17.401
Baby, no.

15:20.172 --> 15:21.939
Where'd you get that necklace?

15:23.041 --> 15:25.343
Where did you get that necklace? Huh?

15:25.377 --> 15:27.745
Answer me, you brain dead freak!

15:30.315 --> 15:32.650
Oh, baby.

16:17.229 --> 16:19.630
Okay.

16:19.665 --> 16:20.931
Okay.

16:24.836 --> 16:27.872
You're fine.
You're fine.

16:40.285 --> 16:42.286
<i>Mack!</i>

16:43.321 --> 16:44.321
Addy?

16:44.990 --> 16:47.158
Addy? Where'd you go?

16:48.994 --> 16:50.594
Addy!

17:08.568 --> 17:10.602
Oh, wait a minute.

17:11.404 --> 17:12.771
What?

17:12.905 --> 17:14.638
I've been here.

17:18.478 --> 17:20.045
Déjà vu.

17:26.085 --> 17:27.252
Right.

17:38.397 --> 17:40.732
Ha. Bite me.

17:53.379 --> 17:55.780
Doesn't mean she's dead, Mack.

17:56.883 --> 17:58.717
She could've given it her
best shot then bolted.

17:58.751 --> 18:00.252
She's a smart girl.

18:02.121 --> 18:03.755
Hey, ugly!

18:13.032 --> 18:14.032
Addy.

18:16.202 --> 18:17.269
You can have all the others!

18:17.303 --> 18:18.837
You <i> cannot</i> have her!

18:20.840 --> 18:22.908
She didn't deserve this.

18:40.626 --> 18:43.662
Sometimes you're the windshield.
Sometimes you're the bug.

18:49.902 --> 18:51.102
This is her necklace.

18:52.171 --> 18:53.204
You can't have it.

18:56.909 --> 18:57.909
No mercy.

19:06.118 --> 19:07.586
Come on.

19:33.679 --> 19:35.614
You on steroids?! Huh?!

19:36.482 --> 19:38.984
I was brought up to compete clean.

19:53.666 --> 19:56.368
One foot to the right, Mack.

19:59.338 --> 20:00.505
Go away.

20:00.539 --> 20:02.674
I'll be dead soon.

20:02.708 --> 20:03.608
Not soon enough.

20:15.087 --> 20:16.087
Addy?

20:17.123 --> 20:18.123
Addy?

20:18.324 --> 20:20.325
<i>Mack!</i>

20:24.530 --> 20:25.497
Damn it.

20:27.199 --> 20:27.999
To the right.

20:28.034 --> 20:29.601
To the right! To the right, Mack!

20:34.140 --> 20:35.707
Too far.

20:36.609 --> 20:37.909
You again?

20:45.584 --> 20:46.618
<i>Mack!</i>

21:06.572 --> 21:08.573
<i>Mack!</i>

21:10.643 --> 21:12.644
<i>Mack!</i>

21:21.320 --> 21:22.454
I know that door.

21:23.389 --> 21:25.657
Where have I seen that door before?

21:33.032 --> 21:34.332
What is it, huh?!

21:36.035 --> 21:38.036
What do you want from me?!

21:40.042 --> 21:42.042
What is it, huh?!

21:42.067 --> 21:44.268
What do you want from me?!

21:44.970 --> 21:45.903
Huh?!

21:47.572 --> 21:49.407
Answer me!

21:55.380 --> 21:57.047
What is it Addy?!

21:58.083 --> 21:59.717
You can't have her.

22:00.419 --> 22:01.919
I won't let you.

22:11.463 --> 22:14.598
Is there something behind that
door you don't want me to see?

22:14.633 --> 22:16.534
Is that what this is?

22:17.436 --> 22:18.102
What is it?

22:18.136 --> 22:19.670
What is it, man? Is it Addy?

22:19.704 --> 22:21.872
What is it you don't want me to see?

22:56.475 --> 22:59.243
Mack?

22:59.277 --> 23:00.311
Hey.

23:00.345 --> 23:01.278
Are you okay?

23:01.313 --> 23:02.813
Yeah.

23:02.848 --> 23:05.883
Yeah, ummm...

23:05.917 --> 23:06.650
No.

23:06.685 --> 23:08.352
I don't know.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.554
You want to talk about it?

23:10.589 --> 23:11.755
I had this dream.

23:11.790 --> 23:14.892
It's more like a premonition than a dream.
You know it's like

23:14.926 --> 23:16.227
a psychic nightmare.

23:16.261 --> 23:17.828
Whoa.

23:17.863 --> 23:20.965
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Psychic?

23:20.999 --> 23:22.900
Mack Thompson, world's most skeptical man,

23:22.934 --> 23:25.302
is having psychic premonitions?

23:25.337 --> 23:26.203
Come here.

23:27.105 --> 23:28.572
What are you doing?

23:28.607 --> 23:30.474
Taking your temperature. I think you're
having a fever dream. Addy, come on.

23:30.509 --> 23:31.509
This is serious.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.278
I'm serious too.

23:34.312 --> 23:37.081
Okay, if you haven't noticed,
we're in the middle of nowhere.

23:37.115 --> 23:39.550
We have no water. We have no food or fuel.

23:42.454 --> 23:44.555
I can't have you falling apart on me, babe.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.428
I'm sorry.

23:51.463 --> 23:53.831
I'm not falling apart on you though.

23:53.865 --> 23:55.232
I'm not.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.671
It's just...

24:02.908 --> 24:06.277
It just felt so real, you know?

24:06.978 --> 24:10.881
You know it felt like it's about something,
you know?

24:10.916 --> 24:13.651
It is about something. It is. It has to be.

24:13.685 --> 24:18.989
But I don't think it's the future.
I think it's about you.

24:19.024 --> 24:21.859
I think your subconscious is
trying to tell you something.

24:21.893 --> 24:23.127
Okay?

24:23.161 --> 24:26.463
So let's... let's figure it out.
What happened?

24:27.299 --> 24:30.000
Okay.

24:30.035 --> 24:31.769
Ummm,

24:33.772 --> 24:36.574
it's... It's one of these
dreams that keeps repeating,

24:36.608 --> 24:38.742
you know like each time
it's a little bit different.

24:38.777 --> 24:40.811
Each time I wake up next to you.

24:40.845 --> 24:43.147
I look over and you're gone.

24:44.215 --> 24:45.716
I hear you crying.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.985
Okay, well that one's easy. You don't...

24:48.019 --> 24:52.923
don't need Freud or a
brain scan to figure that one out.

24:52.958 --> 24:54.858
Mack, you're worried about me.

24:54.893 --> 24:58.062
And listen, I'm worried about you too.

24:58.096 --> 24:58.996
But that's... that's not just it.

24:59.030 --> 25:00.264
That's just how it starts, right?

25:00.298 --> 25:02.900
And then I hear you,
and you're in some kind of trouble.

25:02.934 --> 25:05.402
And then and then I hear this sound,
this like zombie howl

25:05.437 --> 25:07.071
echoing off in the distance.
It's super creepy.

25:08.139 --> 25:09.640
There it is. That's the sound.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.342
There it is again. That sound.

25:11.376 --> 25:12.643
I'm telling you, that thing is out there.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.244
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's a zombie.

25:14.279 --> 25:15.846
Okay so hey, hey listen.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.648
Let's go kill it,

25:17.682 --> 25:18.916
together.

25:19.217 --> 25:20.751
Okay?

25:31.029 --> 25:34.031
Watch, watch, watch.
It's gonna show up right over there.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.668
You sure?

25:38.036 --> 25:39.970
Any second.

25:43.675 --> 25:44.775
Mack?

25:58.023 --> 26:01.792
What? That's so weird.

26:01.826 --> 26:04.261
It's... I've stood right here and

26:04.295 --> 26:05.929
and and seen it every time in my dream.

26:05.964 --> 26:06.864
Right here!

26:10.368 --> 26:12.136
Mack, listen. Mack!

26:12.270 --> 26:13.270
Mack!

26:14.372 --> 26:15.372
Mack!

26:20.412 --> 26:22.112
This isn't right.

26:22.147 --> 26:23.347
This was...

26:30.021 --> 26:30.754
Is it here?

26:30.789 --> 26:32.556
Stay back, stay back.

26:32.590 --> 26:34.525
Okay, okay.

26:34.626 --> 26:35.826
Okay.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.235
Mack, what are you looking for?

26:45.270 --> 26:46.103
A snake.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.939
It's here.
It's... it's... it's always right here.

26:50.475 --> 26:51.608
Uh...

26:53.812 --> 26:55.546
Uh...

26:57.348 --> 26:58.782
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

26:58.817 --> 27:00.284
No.

27:01.486 --> 27:04.221
Maybe a little bit.
But Mack, hey listen, listen.

27:04.823 --> 27:06.390
It's the world we're living in. Okay

27:06.424 --> 27:08.459
we're all a little bit crazy.

27:08.927 --> 27:10.861
Something's not right.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.397
Mack! Wait!

27:16.267 --> 27:16.834
Mack!

27:16.868 --> 27:17.701
Lock and load.

27:17.736 --> 27:20.104
This thing is badass. 6'7" maybe 280.

27:20.138 --> 27:22.639
And when you hear a hawk,
you stand right next to me

27:22.674 --> 27:24.808
because all hell's about to break loose.

27:41.259 --> 27:42.826
What's happening?

27:46.331 --> 27:48.732
This is where it killed me the last time.

27:49.400 --> 27:51.034
Sounds horrible.

27:52.036 --> 27:55.105
I'm glad that was just a dream.
Hey Mack, is that...

27:55.573 --> 27:56.740
Is that the door from <i> your</i> dream?

27:56.775 --> 27:58.609
Yeah, that's it.

28:00.545 --> 28:02.112
Maybe we should go see what's inside.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.047
I don't think that's a good idea.

28:04.082 --> 28:05.916
In your dream, did you ever go inside?

28:06.818 --> 28:09.520
No, Frankenzombie always killed
me before I made it that far.

28:10.688 --> 28:11.588
Yeah, we should see.

28:11.623 --> 28:12.356
No.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.092
No, come on.
What if this is just a dream again?

28:15.126 --> 28:16.693
I mean what if that thing
is just waiting in there

28:16.728 --> 28:17.828
to kill us?

28:17.862 --> 28:20.831
Mack, we can't both be having the same dream,
okay?

28:23.434 --> 28:25.135
Because I'm awake.

28:28.807 --> 28:29.807
Hey.

28:38.172 --> 28:39.106
Addy.

28:40.208 --> 28:41.741
You sure you want to do this?

28:43.077 --> 28:45.212
Yeah, we've come this far.
Don't you want to know what's inside?

28:45.246 --> 28:46.313
No. Whatever it is, it's bad.

28:46.347 --> 28:47.881
So let's just... let's just get out of here.

28:47.915 --> 28:49.082
Mack, it was a nightmare.

28:49.117 --> 28:50.884
There's probably nothing bad in there.

28:50.918 --> 28:52.986
But if we don't look, we'll never know.

28:57.859 --> 28:58.992
Addy, no.

29:06.868 --> 29:08.101
Okay.

29:08.936 --> 29:11.238
Okay, great, mystery solved.
I feel so much better now.

29:11.272 --> 29:12.372
Can we go?

29:12.406 --> 29:13.240
Dude.

29:14.142 --> 29:15.675
Can't give up yet.

29:24.919 --> 29:26.987
Okay. All right, Addy.

29:40.067 --> 29:41.434
What do you see?

29:43.604 --> 29:44.204
Uhhh.

29:45.273 --> 29:47.374
I don't know.

29:47.408 --> 29:49.709
It's so dark. Maybe

29:49.744 --> 29:52.045
it's some kind of room, but I can't tell.

29:52.813 --> 29:54.080
Okay, well keep trying.

29:54.649 --> 29:56.349
There's nothing in there.
Let's just go, okay?

29:56.384 --> 29:58.418
Keep trying.

30:12.600 --> 30:13.733
What is it?

30:13.768 --> 30:15.802
Hang on. My eyes are still adjusting.
It's so dark in here.

30:15.836 --> 30:17.337
It's pitch black.

30:21.509 --> 30:22.876
Looks like a staircase

30:23.644 --> 30:24.611
leading down.

30:37.558 --> 30:38.858
No. No.

31:52.033 --> 31:53.266
Don't be afraid.

31:55.369 --> 31:57.203
Don't be afraid.

32:12.787 --> 32:14.788
<i>Mack!</i>

33:47.054 --> 33:48.455
Addy?

33:49.757 --> 33:50.824
Addy?

33:51.592 --> 33:54.227
<i>Don't! You're hurting me! Don't!</i>

34:00.635 --> 34:02.269
It bit me.

34:41.876 --> 34:43.009
Why won't you die?

34:46.047 --> 34:50.350
Why won't you die?!
Why won't you die?!

35:11.272 --> 35:13.073
Mack, wake up! Wake up! Hey, hey, hey.

35:13.107 --> 35:15.475
You're having a nightmare.
Hey, you're having a nightmare, okay?

35:15.509 --> 35:17.310
You're talking in your sleep.

35:17.979 --> 35:19.479
What was I saying?

35:21.716 --> 35:24.818
Why won't you die, why... why won't you die.

35:31.225 --> 35:33.326
Mack?

35:45.606 --> 35:48.241
Addy, there's something I have to tell you.

35:48.843 --> 35:51.177
Does it have to do with the dream?

35:53.514 --> 35:54.781
What is it?

36:13.801 --> 36:16.569
Addy, I have to ask you something.

36:24.812 --> 36:26.279
Where

36:26.781 --> 36:29.382
did this come from?

36:42.363 --> 36:44.197
I am not afraid.

38:25.289 --> 38:27.490
<i>Don't! You're hurting me! Don't!</i>

38:32.363 --> 38:33.363
Oh my God.

38:33.464 --> 38:35.098
Oh my God.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.400
What happened?

38:37.968 --> 38:38.668
Mack!

38:38.769 --> 38:40.503
Mack, I need your help!

38:42.673 --> 38:44.641
Hang on. Okay?

38:44.675 --> 38:46.509
We're gonna get you help, okay?

38:46.543 --> 38:47.644
Mack!

38:52.182 --> 38:53.850
Somebody there?

38:57.254 --> 38:58.588
What's wrong?

38:58.622 --> 39:00.056
Mom?

39:00.090 --> 39:01.257
Are you infected?

39:02.826 --> 39:04.761
Did you do this to him?

39:26.050 --> 39:27.750
Why won't you die?

39:28.118 --> 39:30.386
Why won't you die?

39:33.357 --> 39:35.458
Why won't you die?

40:13.464 --> 40:14.831
Addy?

40:15.933 --> 40:17.266
Addy, where'd you go?

40:17.301 --> 40:18.468
<i>Mack!</i>

40:19.069 --> 40:20.236
Addy!

40:27.378 --> 40:28.478
Hey, hey, hey.

40:28.512 --> 40:31.881
Addy, baby, baby. Baby, what's wrong?
Hey, what's wrong?

40:33.484 --> 40:35.585
Mack, I'm so sorry.

40:35.619 --> 40:37.520
I thought it was you.

40:37.554 --> 40:41.391
All this time I thought it was you.

40:41.425 --> 40:44.060
I know what the
flashbacks were about.

40:45.229 --> 40:48.698
I thought it was you,
but it was me.

40:48.732 --> 40:55.271
Oh my God, it was me. It was me.

40:55.305 --> 40:57.707
That first night...

40:57.741 --> 41:00.043
I didn't know.

41:00.077 --> 41:03.479
I didn't know.
I didn't know how to give mercy.

41:03.514 --> 41:05.581
I didn't know
you had to kill the brain.

41:05.616 --> 41:12.055
I just kept stabbing
her over and over and over again.

41:12.089 --> 41:13.956
Oh my God.

41:13.991 --> 41:20.296
I killed her, Mack.
Oh my God. Forgive me.

41:20.330 --> 41:24.067
I killed my mom.

41:24.101 --> 41:27.403
I killed her.
