WEBVTT

00:02.438 --> 00:04.739
The hunters got your mother, baby eagle.

00:04.740 --> 00:08.160
But you're gonna be okay.

00:11.016 --> 00:13.941
Mount Brickleberry is a volcano?

00:13.942 --> 00:16.980
There is much about Brickleberry
you do not know, Ethel Anderson.

00:16.981 --> 00:18.214
How did you know my name?

00:18.215 --> 00:20.217
Our Gods tell us many things.

00:20.218 --> 00:24.016
Also, once we Google
spring break 2008...

00:24.017 --> 00:27.992
Anal creampie, safe search
off, your picture come up.

00:27.993 --> 00:29.724
Nice to meet you in person.

00:29.725 --> 00:32.741
Can we get back to the part
about the volcano, please?

00:32.743 --> 00:34.544
Our tribe has legend.

00:34.545 --> 00:36.780
One day, Brickleberry will be no more.

00:36.781 --> 00:38.749
Volcano is sign.

00:38.750 --> 00:43.670
Come with us to our
people's most holy place.

00:44.790 --> 00:48.092
Gods create Brickleberry.
Hope it last many season.

00:48.093 --> 00:50.728
But one day, Gods tire of Brickleberry.

00:50.729 --> 00:54.699
Say, once people of Brickleberry
entertain us, make us laugh.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.901
Now, no one watch their adventures.

00:56.902 --> 00:59.837
Seasons end. Gods not renew.

00:59.838 --> 01:03.107
People say, Gods,
bring back Brickleberry.

01:03.108 --> 01:04.775
Start online petition.

01:04.777 --> 01:06.478
Gods not listen.

01:06.479 --> 01:09.782
If our world's about to end,
why don't you look worried?

01:09.783 --> 01:11.550
Because we're looking at this.

01:11.551 --> 01:15.391
Woo! Spring break, mother[Bleep]!

01:21.662 --> 01:23.999
<i>♪Brickleberry!</i>

01:24.000 --> 01:26.580
<i>♪Brickleberry!</i>

01:28.969 --> 01:32.128
So I surveyed the volcano
and, scientifically speaking,

01:32.129 --> 01:34.341
it is very unlikely to erupt.

01:34.342 --> 01:38.045
Well, I just wanna say, if that thing
does erupt, we will not evacuate!

01:38.046 --> 01:39.846
Well, we'll kinda have to.

01:39.847 --> 01:42.116
I... don't... evacuate.

01:42.117 --> 01:46.520
I didn't evacuate during the forest
fires of '96, the flood of '01, or the...

01:46.521 --> 01:49.023
Wait, I thought you said
you evacuated during Katrina.

01:49.024 --> 01:52.293
No, I said I evacuated on Katrina.

01:52.294 --> 01:53.528
Great girl, Katrina.

01:53.529 --> 01:56.097
I would've married her if she
wasn't such a prude in the bedroom.

01:56.098 --> 01:58.066
No anal blah, blah, blah.

01:58.067 --> 02:01.670
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna
need like a half day off tomorrow...

02:01.671 --> 02:03.005
To give birth.

02:03.006 --> 02:04.306
Wha-wha-wha-wha-what!

02:04.307 --> 02:06.442
- You're pregnant?
- Yeah, for nine months.

02:06.443 --> 02:08.676
I can't believe none of
you noticed my baby bump.

02:08.678 --> 02:12.715
Your body has a lot of bumps. We
can't keep track of what they all are.

02:12.716 --> 02:15.173
Well, this one's a baby. Wait.

02:15.174 --> 02:17.487
No, this one's a baby.

02:17.488 --> 02:18.888
Uh, I think.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.625
I'd like to meet the guy that had
sex with you, is he still in there?

02:21.626 --> 02:23.360
I'm a surrogate mother, silly.

02:23.361 --> 02:25.495
Helping a nice gay couple have a baby.

02:25.496 --> 02:27.431
Hang on! Y'all ignoring
the elephant in the room.

02:27.432 --> 02:29.824
What? Connie never gets
this much attention.

02:29.825 --> 02:32.457
How is everybody so calm?
A volcano's about to go off,

02:32.458 --> 02:34.805
and Connie's obviously giving
birth to the antichrist.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.740
It's the end of the mother[Bleep] world!

02:36.741 --> 02:38.108
- Here he goes again.
- Yeah.

02:38.109 --> 02:40.027
Denzel, last year,
you saw the face of the

02:40.028 --> 02:42.546
antichrist in 12 different
slices of burnt toast.

02:42.547 --> 02:46.836
Yeah. Maybe the toaster
was set on anti-crust.

02:46.837 --> 02:48.186
[Bleep] You, toaster!

02:48.187 --> 02:50.403
Laugh all you want, but
I know the antichrist.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.463
When I was young, I spent
a lot of time in church,

02:52.464 --> 02:57.264
and my preacher said
the antichrist was real.

02:57.363 --> 02:59.697
Abba abba foray seba
doo-dah sah dah dey dey.

02:59.698 --> 03:02.066
Oohra suli rah-dah-dah-diddy!

03:02.067 --> 03:04.669
Aah dah da oh!

03:04.670 --> 03:06.671
At least, that's what I think he said.

03:06.672 --> 03:08.472
Denzel, you're being ridiculous.

03:08.473 --> 03:11.185
All I'm saying is, virgin
birth, nice-looking?

03:11.186 --> 03:12.265
Jesus Christ.

03:12.266 --> 03:15.835
Virgin birth,
Connie-looking? Antichrist.

03:15.836 --> 03:19.076
Uh, guys? I think my...

03:20.452 --> 03:22.387
Yep, my water broke.

03:22.388 --> 03:24.248
Ugh!

03:27.894 --> 03:31.330
Connie, your baby's gay parents should
be on their way to the hospital now.

03:31.331 --> 03:32.643
Oh, good.

03:32.644 --> 03:36.068
Uh, they should be, but they just
died in a hilarious car accident.

03:36.069 --> 03:38.103
What! Oh, no.

03:38.104 --> 03:41.439
Don't fret, Connie. It's very
easy to sell a white baby.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.908
- Ca-ching!
- No, I'm keeping it.

03:43.909 --> 03:47.812
Well, good for you. And bad for
Dubai's open air baby-slave market.

03:47.813 --> 03:51.349
Now, Connie, labor can
sometimes take 24 to 48 hours.

03:51.350 --> 03:53.018
So prepare yourself for a long...

03:53.019 --> 03:54.939
Whoa!

03:59.592 --> 04:03.766
Damn it, BoDean. I told you to
pack our shit, not our sheep!

04:03.767 --> 04:05.486
Oh, hey, Woody. What are you doing here?

04:05.487 --> 04:07.331
Ain't you supposed to
be evacuating like us?

04:07.332 --> 04:08.833
Boys, you know I don't evacuate.

04:08.834 --> 04:13.704
I laugh in the face of hurricanes,
earthquakes, Godzilla, even Nicki Minaj.

04:13.705 --> 04:16.709
But just between us, I'm
terrified of volcanoes.

04:16.711 --> 04:18.776
- Why's that?
- Have you ever heard of Pompeii?

04:18.777 --> 04:20.644
Yeah, I caught that by
screwing Bobby's sister.

04:20.646 --> 04:23.414
- Yeah. She gave it to me too.
- No, you idiots.

04:23.415 --> 04:27.251
Pompeii was an ancient city
that was destroyed by a volcano.

04:27.252 --> 04:29.190
The people were all covered with lava,

04:29.191 --> 04:32.490
frozen forever doing whatever
they were doing when they died.

04:32.491 --> 04:35.659
What if I get covered with lava while
I'm doing something embarrassing?

04:35.660 --> 04:38.295
- Like this guy.
- That's how my Daddy went.

04:38.296 --> 04:40.264
We had to have a closed casket.

04:40.265 --> 04:41.808
Focus, hillbillies!

04:41.809 --> 04:45.301
Now I can't have no archaeologist of
the future finding me and thinking I'm

04:45.302 --> 04:51.202
some kind of perv just because a volcano
got me while I'm milking my prostate.

04:51.309 --> 04:52.776
For health reasons.

04:52.777 --> 04:55.402
Boys, can you build me a
secret volcano-proof bunker?

04:55.403 --> 05:01.283
We already got one. We built
it to survive the Obama-lypse.

05:01.453 --> 05:05.356
This is my beautiful
baby. His name is Donnie.

05:05.357 --> 05:07.792
- Aw!
- What a pretty name!

05:07.793 --> 05:10.414
Thanks. I got it out of a book.

05:10.415 --> 05:12.564
I didn't have time to go
through the other book.

05:12.565 --> 05:15.867
Bacardi, Listerine, Arugula.

05:15.868 --> 05:18.115
Oh, there's my shopping list.

05:18.116 --> 05:22.375
Now Connie, I'm sorry about this, but
federal guidelines dictate that I don't

05:22.376 --> 05:26.478
have to let you breastfeed at work unless
you got a real sweet set of milkies.

05:26.479 --> 05:27.979
What's wrong with my boobs?

05:27.980 --> 05:31.773
Besides the fact that
you also have a back set?

05:31.774 --> 05:34.853
Ah! Antichrist! Antichrist!

05:34.854 --> 05:36.588
This is going too far, Denzel!

05:36.589 --> 05:38.490
That baby's evil. I'll prove it!

05:38.491 --> 05:40.255
- How?
- Through science.

05:40.256 --> 05:42.661
If I shoot it in the face
and it lives, it's the Devil.

05:42.662 --> 05:45.497
Okay! Okay! Shoot it
if it will shut you up.

05:45.498 --> 05:48.466
No! I thought you
were my friend, Denzel!

05:48.467 --> 05:53.071
How could you say those
horrible things about my baby?

05:53.072 --> 05:55.607
It's just a baby, Denzel.

05:55.608 --> 05:58.377
This has got to stop.
You really upset Connie.

05:58.378 --> 06:01.046
Next time don't hesitate.
Aim for the Fontanelle.

06:01.047 --> 06:03.214
All right! Enough with
the black baby names.

06:03.215 --> 06:05.550
I guess I should apologize
to Connie and Donnie.

06:05.551 --> 06:08.851
- Leave the gun!
- Fine!

06:09.351 --> 06:12.351
Connie, I'm sorry...

06:15.190 --> 06:18.364
Uh, Donnie, I'm not good at
this apology stuff, but...

06:18.365 --> 06:21.767
I'm sorry I said you were the antichrist.
Maybe when you grow up a little, you and...

06:21.768 --> 06:24.120
Apology accepted.

06:24.121 --> 06:26.605
Oh, thanks, Donnie. You're
pretty cool. Wait, you can talk?

06:26.606 --> 06:32.506
Denzel, I'm going to rip out your
dick and feed it to the demons of hell!

06:38.316 --> 06:40.511
<i>♪Oh, who's my cute baby?</i>

06:40.512 --> 06:42.280
<i>♪You're my cute baby!</i>

06:42.281 --> 06:45.816
<i>♪I love my cute baby,

06:48.820 --> 06:50.154

06:50.155 --> 06:53.224
He said he was going to rip my
dick off and feed it to a Demon.

06:53.225 --> 06:56.797
- He the goddamn antichrist!
- Seriously? That sounds horrifying!

06:56.798 --> 06:58.921
I'm about to eat a Hot Pocket
you want to double-check

06:58.922 --> 07:01.424
it's not Beelzebub before
I pop it in the microwave?

07:01.425 --> 07:03.273
Hot Pocket!

07:03.274 --> 07:08.314
- You're fat!
- Okay, then why does that happen?

07:11.343 --> 07:13.711
There's a simple scientific
explanation, Denzel.

07:13.712 --> 07:18.992
Clearly, pesticides have
built up in the groundwater.

07:21.353 --> 07:23.421
And how does science explain that shit?

07:23.422 --> 07:26.924
There are several avian disorders
that can cause birds to die mid-flight.

07:26.925 --> 07:30.765
Oh, yeah? Well, what about that?

07:31.483 --> 07:34.765
Hey, look! It's a sunny
circle and a happy star!

07:34.766 --> 07:35.880
- Aw.
- Yep.

07:35.881 --> 07:40.381
- That sounds about right.
- Aw, come on!

07:41.172 --> 07:43.840
You can stay with me in
the bunker, cubsie wubsie.

07:43.841 --> 07:46.443
Everyone else will die
in a firestorm of lava.

07:46.444 --> 07:48.545
Why don't we just move,
you [Bleep] maniac!

07:48.546 --> 07:52.566
And voo-la! Our top secret bunker.

07:54.552 --> 07:56.953
So is this the elevator to the bunker?

07:56.954 --> 07:59.188
Are you sure this
thing is volcano-proof?

07:59.189 --> 08:00.657
Oh, it's everything-proof.

08:00.658 --> 08:03.460
Keeps out zombies, draculas, dragons...

08:03.461 --> 08:04.727
And Jews.

08:04.728 --> 08:06.963
Hot dog! It's like a dream come true!

08:06.964 --> 08:11.201
And once this door is closed, it
can't ever be opened from the outside.

08:11.202 --> 08:14.142
Ever. I mean, ever.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.656
Uh oh, Bobby. I think we
put the door on backwards.

08:17.657 --> 08:20.798
Holy shit! You mean we're
trapped in here forever?

08:20.799 --> 08:23.647
Oh, no, not forever. Just till we die.

08:23.648 --> 08:28.748
Well, thanks for boosting
my spirits, [Bleep]Face!

08:29.387 --> 08:31.455
Steve, you're my best friend.

08:31.456 --> 08:33.823
Just give me a chance to
prove what that baby really is.

08:33.825 --> 08:36.419
- Not this again.
- Come on, Steve!

08:36.419 --> 08:38.828
This volcano blew its top
on the day Donnie was born.

08:38.830 --> 08:44.068
It's a sign of the apocalypse!
Look at the clouds around it!

08:44.068 --> 08:47.210
All I see is an elephant
flying an airplane and...

08:47.211 --> 08:50.575
Wait, what's that? A
giraffe with titties.

08:50.576 --> 08:53.178
Damn, you stupid, Steve.

08:53.179 --> 08:55.079
Hey, Connie. How's the baby?

08:55.080 --> 08:58.115
I've come to realize that Donnie
is different from other babies.

08:58.116 --> 08:59.917
It's about time! We gotta kill...

08:59.918 --> 09:04.769
He's gifted! He's so smart, he likes
watching baby Einstein videos backwards.

09:04.770 --> 09:05.758
Look.

09:05.759 --> 09:07.525
Kill, kill, kill.

09:07.526 --> 09:09.700
Sa... sa-tan.

09:09.701 --> 09:12.630
Satan. My sweet Satan.

09:12.631 --> 09:16.032
It's weird. I learn as much
from Donnie as he learns from me.

09:16.033 --> 09:19.368
Like today, he's been
teaching me Biblical Aramaic!

09:19.369 --> 09:23.449
Al es-bataar qumran iskatu rakanoth!

09:24.003 --> 09:26.097
Isn't he the cutie-wutest?

09:26.098 --> 09:28.079
So, um, Connie?

09:28.080 --> 09:31.281
How exactly was this baby conceived?

09:31.282 --> 09:34.084
It was a pretty standard
artificial insemination.

09:34.085 --> 09:36.353
Okay, my dear, this won't take a minute.

09:36.354 --> 09:39.894
Ave satanas! Sanguis bibimus!

09:44.328 --> 09:47.097
Oh, hell, no. You guys
are messing with me, right?

09:47.098 --> 09:52.318
Thanks for coming by, but
I gotta feed Donnie now.

09:55.806 --> 09:59.175
So we're stuck down here
the rest of our lives?

09:59.176 --> 10:01.811
At least you're old and
near death. Think of me.

10:01.812 --> 10:03.880
Great! What are we supposed to do now?

10:03.881 --> 10:05.916
Repopulate the Earth! Who wants some?

10:05.917 --> 10:07.451
Anything else we can do?

10:07.452 --> 10:09.586
I did install an activity center.

10:09.587 --> 10:11.388
Who wants to play sorry?

10:11.389 --> 10:13.690
Uh, Bobby? All the pieces are missing.

10:13.691 --> 10:15.258
Damn you, Goodwill!

10:15.259 --> 10:19.495
Oh, you two Morons are really firing
up my irritable bowel syndrome.

10:19.496 --> 10:22.365
Now where's the shitter in
this tootincommon tool shed?

10:22.366 --> 10:24.262
Oh, it's right over...

10:24.263 --> 10:26.192
Uh, uh...

10:26.193 --> 10:27.202
Eh...

10:27.203 --> 10:29.301
Shit! Where is the bathroom?

10:29.302 --> 10:31.115
Well, remember, Bobby,
you decided to go with

10:31.116 --> 10:32.808
the crown molding instead of the toilet.

10:32.809 --> 10:35.344
Well, somebody's gotta
think about resale value.

10:35.345 --> 10:37.604
No bathroom? I've got to go!

10:37.605 --> 10:40.149
Try to take your mind off
of it. Here, have a snack.

10:40.150 --> 10:42.018
We got prunes, coffee, refried beans.

10:42.019 --> 10:47.419
And for dessert we got them
chocolate ex-lax candies.

10:47.558 --> 10:49.793
- Sorry I doubted you, Denzel.
- Don't sweat it.

10:49.794 --> 10:51.939
We just need some help
from... Preacher Vernon?

10:51.940 --> 10:53.703
- Eh?
- The antichrist has come.

10:53.704 --> 10:55.649
- Just like you said.
- I said that?

10:55.650 --> 10:57.703
- Uh, kind of.
- What should we do?

10:57.704 --> 11:01.544
Let me see what the snakes say.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.242
Oh, he like to bite. Gotta put him back.

11:05.243 --> 11:08.045
They say... we got to do a exorcism.

11:08.046 --> 11:09.949
Did you say exorcism?

11:09.950 --> 11:13.625
I don't know. I got a lot of snake
venom related brain malfunction.

11:13.626 --> 11:17.721
Where am I? Who put
these snakes in my pants?

11:17.722 --> 11:21.458
<i>♪Old MacDonald had
a farm, E-I-E-I-O!</i>

11:21.459 --> 11:23.927
<i>♪And on this farm, he had a...</i>

11:23.928 --> 11:25.173
Cacodaemon.

11:25.174 --> 11:27.530

11:43.122 --> 11:46.549
Oh, antichrists love old MacDonald.
Just like it say in the Bible.

11:46.550 --> 11:50.733
Okay. We got holy water, sharpened stakes,
and a DVD of Evil Dead 3 for him to sign.

11:50.734 --> 11:51.681
We ready.

11:51.682 --> 11:54.972
But what chance do the three of
us have against the Prince of evil?

11:54.973 --> 11:57.193
The four of us. I'm in.

11:57.194 --> 12:00.763
- I thought you only believed in science.
- Oh, I did, then I babysat little Donnie.

12:00.764 --> 12:02.176
He puked up a giant lizard bat,

12:02.177 --> 12:04.632
then said something about my
mom sucking [Bleep] in hell.

12:04.633 --> 12:06.869
[Bleep] Science. Let's
exorcise that bitch!

12:06.870 --> 12:09.605
All right! Everybody grab a snake!

12:09.606 --> 12:12.891
Now lady, feel free to
grab the one-eyed black one,

12:12.892 --> 12:15.496
but don't you dare touch my penis.

12:15.497 --> 12:18.557
That belong to Jesus.

12:20.253 --> 12:21.685
Hi, Connie, I...

12:21.686 --> 12:23.787
Shh! It's little Donnie's nap time.

12:23.788 --> 12:28.648
He can't sleep unless
I play classical music.

12:32.663 --> 12:34.865
It's because he's so intelligent.

12:34.866 --> 12:37.401
Do you want to hold him?

12:37.402 --> 12:39.202
No!

12:39.399 --> 12:44.174
I mean, I just came to tell you the
whole gang sprang for a spa day for you!

12:44.175 --> 12:48.545
Because you must be so tired from
taking care of a newborn, not evil baby.

12:48.546 --> 12:50.914
Oh, I am pretty worn out.

12:50.915 --> 12:53.250
Donnie drank most of my blood for lunch.

12:53.251 --> 12:54.685
Mmm!

12:54.686 --> 12:59.389
Well, Steve and Denzel and their friend
can't wait to take care of Donnie.

12:59.390 --> 13:03.110
Well, maybe for a few minutes.

13:03.861 --> 13:05.228
I'm so excited!

13:05.229 --> 13:07.437
I can't believe Kate
Upton has a side business

13:07.438 --> 13:10.033
where she gives erotic
massages to completion.

13:10.034 --> 13:12.035
Yep. She'll be here any minute.

13:12.036 --> 13:13.603
Just relax.

13:13.604 --> 13:18.884
Let's get rid of those
puffy bags under your eyes!

13:25.650 --> 13:27.751
- Zap, boom, boom, boom.
- Zzzzz!

13:27.752 --> 13:30.287
- Woo woo woo!
- Zibby zap zap zap.

13:30.288 --> 13:33.123
- Shoom. Boom!
- Boom, zam.

13:33.124 --> 13:38.344
Bring it on, Darth, you
big black son of a bitch.

13:39.463 --> 13:42.643
Luke, I am your Daddy.

13:42.668 --> 13:45.303
No. Wait. Are you serious, Bobby?

13:45.304 --> 13:48.205
- I'm a kill you! I'm a kill you!
- [Bleep] You!

13:48.206 --> 13:49.840
Get off me! Get off me!

13:49.841 --> 13:53.410
This is definitely better
than those horrible prequels.

13:53.411 --> 13:55.947
Oh! I'm prairie dogging.

13:55.948 --> 13:58.536
Quiet! Luke's about to
bite Anakin's nose off.

13:58.537 --> 14:02.386
Oh, I gotta take a shit so big
Kim Kardashian may try to marry it.

14:02.387 --> 14:05.627
I gotta get outta here.

14:07.258 --> 14:10.378
Aha! Ha ha ha ha ha!

14:11.496 --> 14:13.536
Uh-oh.

14:20.405 --> 14:21.982
This is it?

14:21.983 --> 14:24.252
You four think you can stop me?

14:24.253 --> 14:28.212
Don't listen to him. He'll use his lies
to try to make us turn on each other.

14:28.213 --> 14:31.115
- The preacher said you're a pussy.
- What?

14:31.116 --> 14:33.017
- What's wrong with you?
- Like that.

14:33.018 --> 14:37.355
That's a good example of
what we shouldn't let him do.

14:37.356 --> 14:40.825
Oh, laugh now, antichrist.
Because surprise!

14:40.826 --> 14:43.361
We've assembled an exorcism dream team!

14:43.362 --> 14:44.423
Father Quinn!

14:44.424 --> 14:46.810
I'm going to need to
be alone with the child.

14:46.811 --> 14:48.415
You don't have a nanny cam, right?

14:48.416 --> 14:50.254
- Rabbi Maltzman!
- No, no.

14:50.255 --> 14:52.836
You stay in there, demon. As
long as you're comfortable.

14:52.837 --> 14:56.640
I schlepped all the way here from
Brooklyn. But don't worry about me.

14:56.641 --> 14:58.475
And Witch Doctor Kuzniak!

14:58.476 --> 15:00.744
Lucky for us, I went to
medical school in Haiti.

15:00.745 --> 15:05.782
And Jorge, who's seen The Exorcist
seven 1/2 times and let us use his car.

15:05.783 --> 15:07.917
I'm not with them! I'm on your side!

15:07.918 --> 15:09.365
Jorge, shut up.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.921
Come on, let me sell you my soul.

15:11.922 --> 15:14.308
I'll sign whatever
contract Ben Affleck signed.

15:14.309 --> 15:17.093
- Whatever!
- I was up for a challenge.

15:17.094 --> 15:19.430
This is going to be far too easy.

15:19.431 --> 15:21.363
The power of Christ compels you!

15:21.364 --> 15:23.085
The power of Christ compels you!

15:23.086 --> 15:25.246
Shut up.

15:26.036 --> 15:31.736
So who wants to choose how
I will kill the rest of you?

15:31.806 --> 15:33.937
- Blowjobbed to death?
- You got it.

15:33.938 --> 15:35.876
By rabid hell hounds.

15:35.877 --> 15:38.457
And here we...

15:40.551 --> 15:43.921
I'm going to write Kate Upton
a not-so-nice Yelp review.

15:43.922 --> 15:45.956
Ethel, what the hell's going on here?

15:45.957 --> 15:48.492
We're doing an exorcism on
your crazy-ass devil baby!

15:48.493 --> 15:51.762
And we almost got blowjobs,
until you showed up!

15:51.763 --> 15:53.664
Connie, we've got to trust the Lord.

15:53.665 --> 15:55.599
Just like it say in the Bible.

15:55.600 --> 16:00.737
If the exorcism don't go so bueno,
throw that goddamn baby in a volcano. Ha!

16:00.738 --> 16:02.088
What? No!

16:02.089 --> 16:04.614
Sorry, Connie, but it's the
only way to stop the apocalypse.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.442
You're lucky we got
a volcano right here.

16:06.443 --> 16:09.245
Most people with devil babies gotta
pay for a plane ticket to Hawaii.

16:09.246 --> 16:11.648
Screw you guys! Come on, Donnie.

16:11.649 --> 16:13.899
I'll protect you, I promise!

16:13.900 --> 16:18.040
Get her! That baby owes us blowjobs!

16:19.790 --> 16:21.917
<i>♪Run away with cute baby!</i>

16:21.918 --> 16:23.994
<i>♪They're trying to kill my cute baby!</i>

16:23.995 --> 16:25.795
<i>♪Cute, cute, cute, cute.</i>

16:25.796 --> 16:27.764
<i>♪Shit, shit, shit, shit!</i>

16:27.765 --> 16:33.637
I bet they'll never find me
here at the top of the volcano.

16:33.638 --> 16:35.489
Ah, crap.

16:35.490 --> 16:37.337
You've got to throw the baby in, Connie.

16:37.338 --> 16:38.909
- He's the Devil!
- Never!

16:38.910 --> 16:41.145
Donnie is a perfectly normal baby!

16:41.146 --> 16:42.892
- Mom?
- What is it, honey?

16:42.893 --> 16:46.584
I've got something that's kind
of hard for me to tell you. I'm...

16:46.585 --> 16:49.353
- Gay?
- No, I'm the Son of Satan.

16:49.354 --> 16:51.789
- Oh, that's a relief.
- I was afraid you'd...

16:51.790 --> 16:53.523
Get mad and throw you in a volcano?

16:53.524 --> 16:55.893
Donnie, I love you no
matter what you are.

16:55.894 --> 16:57.294
I'm your mother.

16:57.295 --> 17:00.164
Connie, he just told
you he's Satan's son!

17:00.165 --> 17:01.999
What does it take, lady?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.400
I got this.

17:06.204 --> 17:09.932
Aw. How could I separate
a Mama and her baby?

17:09.933 --> 17:12.213
Like this!

17:13.479 --> 17:15.279
Ah!

17:17.478 --> 17:19.269
No!

17:19.270 --> 17:21.053
No!

17:21.054 --> 17:22.854
No!

17:38.870 --> 17:40.504
Okay, here's what happened.

17:40.505 --> 17:45.256
It actually says here, do not
throw a devil baby in a volcano.

17:45.257 --> 17:46.712
Do not.

17:46.713 --> 17:49.522
Okay, I'm gonna be honest.
Ain't no words in this book.

17:49.523 --> 17:50.482
Damn it, Vernon!

17:50.483 --> 17:53.150
Never listen to a man
drunk on snake venom.

17:53.151 --> 17:55.519
Just like it say right
here in the Bible.

17:55.520 --> 17:58.820
Let the apocalypse begin!

18:01.159 --> 18:03.379
Oh, shit!

18:21.668 --> 18:24.068
No, no, no!

18:24.306 --> 18:29.286
I said, put it in her
cooter, then her pooter.

18:32.784 --> 18:34.584
Oh!

18:36.050 --> 18:37.040
There!

18:37.041 --> 18:41.361
Thank you, prunes. I think we're okay.

18:47.028 --> 18:52.817
Oh, well. Brickleberry last more
season than I thought it would.

18:52.818 --> 18:54.186
I guess this is it, guys.

18:54.187 --> 18:56.788
Denzel, I have something to confess.

18:56.789 --> 18:58.857
I ate one of your Kit
Kats a couple of weeks ago.

18:58.858 --> 19:00.660
Oh, we even. I [Bleep] Your grandmother.

19:00.661 --> 19:05.096
Ethel, I have to confess. I may have
given you a few unnecessary pelvic exams.

19:05.097 --> 19:07.164
Every stripper in my club has a dong.

19:07.165 --> 19:10.784
Even the one that gave me
a tug job on my birthday?

19:10.785 --> 19:13.768
Especially that one!
Hoo! She's got a biggy!

19:13.769 --> 19:16.529
I love you guys.

19:16.838 --> 19:20.138
Donald Sutherland Cunaman!

19:21.074 --> 19:23.174
What do you think
you're doing, young man?

19:23.175 --> 19:25.609
I did not raise you to end creation!

19:25.610 --> 19:28.444
- Mom!
- You cut it out, right now!

19:28.445 --> 19:31.012
You're embarrassing me
in front of my friends!

19:31.013 --> 19:33.244
Well, if they only like
you because you're causing

19:33.245 --> 19:35.849
the apocalypse, they're
not real friends, are they?

19:35.850 --> 19:37.184
Mom!

19:37.185 --> 19:40.186
I'm going to count to
three. One... two...

19:40.187 --> 19:42.756
Oh, fine! Whatever!

19:42.757 --> 19:44.958
Sorry, guys, my mom is being lame.

19:44.959 --> 19:50.859
We'll do this later, like after
she dies on August 30, 2042.

19:55.936 --> 19:57.770
I'm proud of you, son.

19:57.771 --> 20:02.161
I gotta go, mom. I
kinda belong down there.

20:02.162 --> 20:04.925
My little baby's all grown up.

20:04.926 --> 20:09.906
- See you in hell, ma.
- See you in hell, son.

20:16.623 --> 20:20.625
The apocalypse is over! We're saved!

20:20.626 --> 20:24.286
But where's Woody and Malloy?

20:26.622 --> 20:30.436
This next exhibit was found in the
ancient ruins of Brickleberry Park.

20:30.437 --> 20:34.305
These three people and a small bear were
covered by lava when a volcano erupted!

20:34.306 --> 20:38.504
While they were having what
appears to be a gay orgy.

20:38.505 --> 20:40.648
The Brickleberry four-way
is all we know about

20:40.649 --> 20:43.270
what life was like in the 21st Century.

20:43.271 --> 20:45.684
Hmm. It must have been a paradise.

20:45.685 --> 20:48.882
We believe it was. We believe it was.
