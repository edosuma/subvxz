WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.050
Hey, Zach. Zachary.

00:09.635 --> 00:12.804
What did l say about wandering off?
You have to be careful of strangers.

00:12.971 --> 00:15.057
- Sorry.
- Here.

00:15.224 --> 00:18.894
Dad, balloons are for babies.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.480
Right. What about
that cotton candy? ls that still--?

00:21.647 --> 00:25.442
Oh, no. That's fine.
We could share it after my ride.

00:25.651 --> 00:28.028
l'll try to save you some.
lt looks awfully good to me.

00:28.237 --> 00:31.615
Dad. After the ride.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.786
l'll be watching you.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.698
Dad.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.867
Dad.

02:12.457 --> 02:14.167
A whole hour for a lunch run,
probie?

02:14.376 --> 02:16.461
Yeah, while Ziva and l were out,

02:16.628 --> 02:19.047
she asked me to show her
the best routes to work.

02:19.256 --> 02:23.427
Her driving has gotten a lot better.
Barely broke any laws this time.

02:24.136 --> 02:25.178
Let me get this straight.

02:25.387 --> 02:27.013
Ziva asked you,

02:27.180 --> 02:31.184
who can barely navigate the Navy yard,
to show her the best way to work?

02:31.393 --> 02:33.311
- That's right.
- Well, what about me?

02:34.062 --> 02:35.647
l know every shortcut
in the metro area.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.983
l could shave ten minutes off her
commute like that.

02:38.191 --> 02:39.443
l don't know what to tell you.

02:43.447 --> 02:45.782
lt doesn't make any sense.

02:48.410 --> 02:50.078
Unless...

02:51.913 --> 02:53.832
...maybe l intimidate her.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.500
Yeah, l'm sure that's it.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.919
l've seen it happen before.
lt's a chemical thing.

02:58.128 --> 03:01.423
- Hard to explain.
- l do hope you try.

03:01.631 --> 03:03.050
l told you not to do that again.

03:03.216 --> 03:06.428
Sorry. l was so intimidated by your
presence, l must have forgotten.

03:06.595 --> 03:11.808
Seriously. l do apologize for not asking
your advice on my commute.

03:11.975 --> 03:13.477
Don't worry about it.

03:13.643 --> 03:17.022
lf l would have known you would have
felt so emasculated--

03:17.189 --> 03:19.649
- ls that the word? Emasculated.
- Yes, it is. Emasculated.

03:19.858 --> 03:22.194
l would have asked you first.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.362
lt takes a little more
than an exotic accent

03:24.529 --> 03:26.948
and some stealth ninja moves
to emasculate me.

03:27.157 --> 03:30.702
Only a little more?
How disappointing.

03:32.537 --> 03:33.914
Don't take sides, probie.

03:34.081 --> 03:38.585
Gear up. We have a missing person.
Coleman Park Carousel in Arlington.

03:38.794 --> 03:40.087
- A child?
- Father.

03:40.295 --> 03:42.339
Lieutenant Commander
Alex Tanner.

03:42.672 --> 03:44.091
Disappeared an hour ago.

03:44.299 --> 03:47.386
Do you always respond to
missing persons cases so promptly?

03:47.594 --> 03:51.098
Special circumstances, Ziva.
His 6-year-old son called NClS.

03:51.306 --> 03:54.851
He's in the park, alone, waiting for us.
DiNozzo, you drive.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.478
l think McGee wants to drive, boss.

03:56.686 --> 03:59.898
You know what, Tony?
l would really rather have you drive.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.775
Afraid to run over another
fire hydrant?

04:01.942 --> 04:05.946
l'm sure that wasn't your fault.
lt was, according to the police report.

04:06.154 --> 04:08.615
- l'll drive.
- One more word, you're all walking.

04:08.824 --> 04:11.034
You got it, boss.

04:12.577 --> 04:14.413
l deserved that.

04:24.506 --> 04:25.757
Zach.

04:25.966 --> 04:29.219
Hey, l'm Special Agent DiNozzo,
you can call me Tony, okay?

04:29.428 --> 04:33.724
That's a smart thing to do,
calling NClS. Good boy.

04:34.641 --> 04:38.395
l know this really scary, but l want you
to be brave. Can you do that?

04:39.855 --> 04:43.525
Okay, l want you to think back
to what happened today.

04:44.693 --> 04:46.820
Try to remember the details.

04:47.904 --> 04:49.781
There's no wrong answer here.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.076
- What do we know?
- Nothing. l think the kid's in shock.

04:53.285 --> 04:54.828
No, l'm not.

04:55.162 --> 04:58.040
l'm waiting for Agent DiNozzo
to ask me a question.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.126
What kinds of questions
was l supposed to ask?

05:01.334 --> 05:05.338
What l saw. Why l called NClS.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.885
What did you see, Zach?

05:10.302 --> 05:14.097
Two men were watching us.
l think they kidnapped my Dad.

05:15.307 --> 05:16.933
Describe them.

05:17.184 --> 05:20.312
Dark glasses.
One had a military haircut.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.772
One had a shaved head.

05:21.980 --> 05:25.484
- How old?
- About your age.

05:25.901 --> 05:28.153
They had iPods too.

05:28.779 --> 05:32.657
lt's like a Walkman, boss. An iPod.

05:33.492 --> 05:37.287
They were only listening
in one ear like this.

05:40.999 --> 05:43.251
Be back in a minute, Zach.

05:43.668 --> 05:47.005
- Dark glasses, earwigs.
- Sounds like feds.

05:47.214 --> 05:51.760
You think the FBl would arrest a man
and leave his kid in the park, DiNozzo?

05:51.968 --> 05:53.553
Maybe our commander took a walk.

05:53.762 --> 05:55.806
My father left me in the Maui Hilton
for two days.

05:56.014 --> 05:58.767
He didn't realize l was missing
until he got the room service bill.

05:58.975 --> 06:00.936
Sad, but enlightening.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.355
Boss, l just spoke
with the commander's C.O.

06:03.563 --> 06:04.898
He's very concerned.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.983
Apparently, Commander Tanner
was working

06:07.150 --> 06:09.194
on a highly classified DOD project.

06:09.403 --> 06:10.779
What project, McGee?

06:11.321 --> 06:13.115
l don't-- He wouldn't say
over an unsecured line

06:13.281 --> 06:14.574
but l'm going to find out.

06:14.783 --> 06:16.201
Footage from the security cameras?

06:16.410 --> 06:18.995
Park Security released them to me.

06:19.413 --> 06:24.543
Okay, get ahold of Zach's mom.
And then she can pick him up at NClS.

06:24.793 --> 06:26.795
Boss. Boss.

06:27.629 --> 06:31.049
His mother's dead.
Killed four years ago in a car accident.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.053
Primary next of kin?

06:35.262 --> 06:37.013
There is none.

06:37.889 --> 06:40.809
Just Commander Tanner
and his son.

06:45.355 --> 06:46.940
These guys are definitely pros.

06:47.149 --> 06:48.734
They keep their faces
from the camera.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.403
All we've got to go on
is the kid's description of them.

06:51.611 --> 06:53.655
You know, it doesn't look
like a kidnapping to me.

06:54.364 --> 06:56.575
- They don't have guns.
- Barely touched the commander.

06:56.783 --> 06:58.201
They could have threatened his son.

06:58.368 --> 07:00.495
Explains why they left him alone
in the park.

07:00.704 --> 07:02.581
What do we know
about Commander Tanner?

07:03.206 --> 07:05.375
Well, boss, he is a brilliant man.

07:05.584 --> 07:08.378
A dual Ph.D. from Caltech
in Number and Chaos Theory.

07:08.545 --> 07:10.088
l was reading his thesis online.

07:10.255 --> 07:12.466
He manages to link
non-relativistic quantum effects--

07:12.799 --> 07:15.761
Well, that's useful
to this case, McGee.

07:17.012 --> 07:19.639
Last three years he's been
the Navy's liaison

07:19.848 --> 07:22.601
with a defence contractor,
Q and R Software.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.644
Been the project lead on Honor.

07:24.853 --> 07:27.439
- Which is?
- Classified.

07:28.231 --> 07:31.651
l put a call to the head of security over
there. No one's gotten back to me.

07:32.527 --> 07:34.071
So l thought l would pay them a visit?

07:34.237 --> 07:36.365
Yeah, that's a good answer.
Tony go with him.

07:38.325 --> 07:41.078
The sketch artist is done
with Zach's descriptions.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.121
The boy has a remarkable memory.

07:43.330 --> 07:46.625
There's also someone here
from Social Security to pick him up.

07:46.833 --> 07:50.253
Services, Ziva.
Social Security is for older people.

07:50.462 --> 07:51.755
Noted.

07:51.963 --> 07:55.550
- Do you want me to tell the boy?
- No, l'll handle it. Here, sit down.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.929
Put out a BOLO on the composites.

08:00.097 --> 08:01.181
Hey, Zach.

08:02.265 --> 08:05.602
- Good job on the sketches, man.
- Thanks.

08:06.978 --> 08:09.856
That's Social Services, huh?

08:10.690 --> 08:12.776
They'll take care of you
until we get your dad back.

08:13.068 --> 08:15.529
l can take care of myself.

08:16.113 --> 08:17.364
l don't doubt that.

08:19.574 --> 08:23.787
- But l still have to go.
- Yeah, just for a while. Come on.

08:23.995 --> 08:28.625
What if you--? What if you don't find
my dad, Agent Gibbs?

08:28.834 --> 08:31.753
l'll find him, Zach. l'll find him.

08:31.962 --> 08:33.380
Hey.

08:35.841 --> 08:39.635
lf you ever need me
or even if you just want to talk,

08:40.846 --> 08:42.764
you call, okay?

08:46.518 --> 08:48.854
l'm sorry we didn't get back to you
right away.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.897
We've been having some problems
of our own.

08:51.106 --> 08:53.692
- What kind of problems?
- Honestly, l don't know.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.403
l'm only Mr. Connell's assistant.
l'm sure he can--

08:56.611 --> 08:59.322
That's been happening
for the last half-hour or so.

08:59.531 --> 09:02.034
They should snap back on.

09:05.537 --> 09:06.830
Are you all right, Ms. Osgood?

09:07.039 --> 09:08.832
- lt's Laura.
- Laura.

09:10.959 --> 09:12.753
Ms. Osgood.

09:13.837 --> 09:15.547
l'll take it from here.

09:16.465 --> 09:19.843
- Frank Connell, Q and R security.
- You certainly got here fast.

09:20.052 --> 09:23.722
We just found out about the break-in
ourselves an hour ago.

09:25.098 --> 09:28.518
At 0300 this morning,
our network was breached.

09:28.727 --> 09:32.522
We didn't detect the intrusion until we
attempted to boot up our main servers.

09:32.731 --> 09:35.150
Since then, we've had our hands full
tracking the viruses

09:35.358 --> 09:36.610
they embedded in our system.

09:36.818 --> 09:38.779
Do we know yet
what data's been compromised?

09:38.987 --> 09:41.031
lt's clear they were after
a working copy of Honor

09:41.198 --> 09:44.534
but fortunately it's protected by a key
that exists outside our system.

09:44.743 --> 09:46.912
Key doesn't sound very high tech.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.414
An asymmetric algorithm key
that's committed to memory.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.375
Without it, the software won't work.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.794
lt's just random ones and zeros,
completely worthless.

09:54.086 --> 09:56.630
So you see, NClS has nothing
to worry about, gentlemen.

09:56.838 --> 09:59.091
Great. Except that's not
why we're here.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.760
Who has the Honor key
committed to memory?

10:01.968 --> 10:04.012
Our project leader,
Lieutenant Commander Tanner.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.899
<i>- Yeah, Gibbs.
- We may have a problem, boss.</i>

10:16.108 --> 10:17.776
<i>- May have?
- The Honor code thingy</i>

10:17.984 --> 10:20.153
Commander Tanner was working on
may have been stolen.

10:20.362 --> 10:21.822
<i>l'm trying to confirm it right now.</i>

10:22.030 --> 10:25.534
- What's it supposed to do?
- Break any encryption in use today.

10:25.742 --> 10:28.078
Well, yeah, DiNozzo.
l'd say that sounds like a problem.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.122
<i>And it gets worse, boss.</i>

10:30.330 --> 10:31.873
According to the people here

10:32.082 --> 10:33.917
Tanner's the only one
who can make it work.

10:34.126 --> 10:35.585
<i>All right. l'm heading your way.</i>

10:35.794 --> 10:39.548
Just got to drop off
Zach's pod thing first.

10:43.051 --> 10:44.386
Agent Gibbs.

10:44.594 --> 10:47.806
You calling about your pod thing
you left on my desk?

10:48.014 --> 10:51.518
No. He's here.
The man from the park.

10:51.727 --> 10:53.395
Let me talk to your
social worker, Zach.

10:53.603 --> 10:57.733
l'm not in her office.
As soon as l saw him, l took off.

10:58.066 --> 11:00.402
<i>- Where are you?
- Outside on the street.</i>

11:00.610 --> 11:03.447
Zach, l'm a few blocks from you.
Stay right where you are.

11:03.655 --> 11:07.451
<i>- l can't. He's leaving.
- Zach, listen to me.</i>

11:07.659 --> 11:09.828
<i>- l need you to--
- He knows where my dad is.</i>

11:10.037 --> 11:12.998
We can't let him get away. Hurry.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.708
<i>Zach.</i>

11:52.329 --> 11:54.373
Help. Help.

11:54.790 --> 11:56.958
- NClS. Let the kid go.
- Gibbs.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.964
You little bastard.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.512
Go. Go. Go.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.313
lt's okay.

12:29.658 --> 12:32.577
New hires just keep getting younger,
Madam Director?

12:33.453 --> 12:36.581
Obviously you didn't get the memo,
Agent DiNozzo.

12:37.165 --> 12:38.208
What memo?

12:38.375 --> 12:40.293
The one where it explains
the next person

12:40.460 --> 12:43.046
who calls her madam
gets keel-hauled.

12:43.213 --> 12:44.631
Whatever that is.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.466
- lt's--
- Unpleasant.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.593
Tell Gibbs l want him upstairs.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.979
- What did the director want?
- You.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.314
Upstairs.

13:02.399 --> 13:03.984
l better check on those sketches.

13:07.696 --> 13:11.867
l got a BOLO out on a black Chevy
Suburban, boss, but without plates.

13:12.117 --> 13:15.328
DiNozzo, you will spend the next
24 personally checking each one

13:15.537 --> 13:17.998
in Virginia, Maryland, and D.C.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.834
That's like an impossible--
l'm on that.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.506
You keep an eye on him for me.

13:26.882 --> 13:28.383
l'll be right back.

13:42.731 --> 13:46.026
You know, he was just kidding
when he said keeping an eye on me.

13:46.651 --> 13:51.031
l couldn't remember when Gibbs
asked me, but l think l got it right.

13:51.239 --> 13:56.912
- Got what right?
- The numbers on the license plate.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.544
l was scared, but l remember
most of the numbers.

14:04.753 --> 14:07.589
All right, Zach.

14:07.798 --> 14:09.883
My man. Come on. Give me five.

14:11.802 --> 14:13.929
Come on, meet me up high.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.474
All right. We'll work on that.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.393
Good job.

14:21.937 --> 14:23.939
Always admired your way
with children.

14:24.189 --> 14:26.233
Ever think of having
any of your own?

14:26.733 --> 14:28.235
ls that an offer, Jen?

14:29.736 --> 14:33.907
No, it wasn't an offer, Jethro.
lt was merely an observation.

14:34.116 --> 14:37.119
You know why l get along with kids
so well?

14:38.245 --> 14:42.582
Because when they lie, they don't have
the guile to get away with it.

14:47.337 --> 14:48.922
You wanted to see me?

14:49.089 --> 14:52.426
l have spent the last hour on video
conference with the directors

14:52.592 --> 14:55.470
of the FBl, NSA
and Homeland Security.

14:55.721 --> 14:56.805
Your kind of tea party.

14:57.013 --> 15:00.475
lf Project Honor's compromised,
it will cripple our intelligence networks.

15:00.726 --> 15:02.728
They all want jurisdiction
on this one.

15:02.936 --> 15:06.481
- And you said?
- l have my best agent working it.

15:07.232 --> 15:10.610
Now, tell me you have something.

15:11.028 --> 15:13.530
The same men who kidnapped
the commander went after his son.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.116
Have you considered that he might not
have been kidnapped?

15:16.283 --> 15:18.160
- l have. l don't buy it.
- And?

15:18.368 --> 15:20.454
- Your famous gut again?
- No.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.456
His son.

15:27.335 --> 15:28.879
Abs, give me good news.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.798
Oh, my God. l got this e-mail that says
l may have won $50 million.

15:32.007 --> 15:34.301
And l'm really, really psyched.

15:34.468 --> 15:36.053
Oh, you mean about the case?

15:36.678 --> 15:38.513
l've been going through
Q and R security logs.

15:38.764 --> 15:41.058
lt's like the Fort Knox
of computer systems.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.977
Next generation anti-virus software,
intrusion detection.

15:44.144 --> 15:47.773
- Crypto processors, ACLs, firewalls.
- Hey, hey.

15:48.774 --> 15:51.026
Okay. No one can penetrate
the system, Gibbs.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.237
lt could be disabled if someone had
a high enough clearance.

15:54.404 --> 15:57.699
- lt's an inside job.
- Q and R is monitored 24/7.

15:57.908 --> 16:00.327
All employees have passwords
to gain access to the system.

16:00.660 --> 16:04.289
Like digital fingerprints.
Every keystroke recorded for posterity.

16:04.498 --> 16:08.877
At 3 a.m. this morning, someone
planted a virus into the network.

16:09.086 --> 16:11.171
lt shut down the security system
exactly one hour.

16:11.713 --> 16:15.342
Long enough to breach the network,
remove the software, plant the viruses.

16:15.509 --> 16:16.676
Go.

16:16.843 --> 16:20.097
The virus originated from
Commander Tanner's terminal, sir.

16:20.347 --> 16:24.309
- Someone else could have used it.
- No, sir. The data is very clear.

16:24.518 --> 16:28.021
Pointing out that Q and R's security
system was designed to be accurate.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.898
- Under the circumstances--
- Chip.

16:31.441 --> 16:32.901
He's right about the design, though.

16:33.443 --> 16:34.695
Who designed it?

16:34.861 --> 16:36.780
Q and R's risk management team.

16:36.947 --> 16:39.700
But all of their people are
former law enforcement and military.

16:39.866 --> 16:42.953
- At the highest level.
- Tanner was at the highest level too.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.372
Tony is reviewing statements
from the employees.

16:45.539 --> 16:49.626
l'm reviewing the computer terminals,
but the virus wiped a lot of files.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.878
lt doesn't look good
for the commander, boss.

16:55.632 --> 16:58.260
Wipe that dirt off your lip.

16:58.719 --> 16:59.761
Dirt?

17:06.852 --> 17:09.229
l feel like l've wasted your time,
Agent DiNozzo.

17:09.438 --> 17:14.067
- Bite your tongue. You've been great.
- l just feel bad for that poor little boy.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.569
Well, listen.

17:15.736 --> 17:16.778
lf you think of anything...

17:18.155 --> 17:19.906
...you give me a call

17:20.073 --> 17:21.241
day or night.

17:21.450 --> 17:22.909
Home phone number's on the back.

17:29.666 --> 17:32.878
Where have you been? l could've used
your help with those interviews.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.380
You look like you had your hands full
with her.

17:35.589 --> 17:38.091
Watch your sexual innuendo
around the kid. He's had a hard day.

17:38.300 --> 17:41.428
He's taking it better than most adults.
He's resilient.

17:41.595 --> 17:43.972
Do you see the way he's been acting
around me?

17:44.181 --> 17:46.141
l think it's because
he doesn't like you, Tony.

17:46.391 --> 17:47.768
Kids dig me.

17:48.185 --> 17:50.145
No they don't.

17:50.479 --> 17:53.440
Zach. Zacharoo, buddy.
Come on over here, man.

17:54.608 --> 17:58.111
l was gonna wait until tomorrow
when everyone was here

17:58.320 --> 18:02.616
but considering
what a brave little boy you've been

18:02.824 --> 18:04.785
and how much you've helped us,

18:05.410 --> 18:10.332
l'm gonna make you
an honorary NClS agent.

18:10.540 --> 18:13.126
Thanks. l've got to go to the head.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.548
Yes, Tony. l was mistaken.

18:18.799 --> 18:22.052
Your way with children is only rivalled
by your way with women.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.637
He's under a lot of stress.

18:24.971 --> 18:28.141
- Where's Zach?
- Potty break, boss.

18:31.436 --> 18:32.729
You gonna speak?

18:32.979 --> 18:37.651
l got an lD on one of our suspects.
His name is Vincent Pazzo.

18:37.859 --> 18:42.948
ltalian-born. Freelance mercenary.
Black ops mostly. Some wet work.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.791
How'd you find out about that?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.877
l sent Zach's sketches to some people
who owe me a favour.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.880
lf he's got the Honor program and the
guy who knows how to make it work,

18:51.131 --> 18:52.465
then why'd they go after his kid?

18:52.674 --> 18:53.800
To force him to cooperate.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.011
There's a possibility
Commander Tanner set this up

18:56.261 --> 18:57.804
to make it look like kidnapping.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.350
Keep your voice down.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.477
That's what l would do
if it were my op.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.647
Authorities are looking for a kidnapper,
they should look for a traitor.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.649
lt doesn't feel right, Ziva.

19:09.816 --> 19:13.069
lt doesn't have to feel right
to be right, Gibbs.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.581
Gibbs, can l ask you a question?

19:25.665 --> 19:26.916
Yeah, shoot.

19:28.376 --> 19:32.047
How are you going to get this
out of here when it's finished?

19:32.505 --> 19:36.676
Good question. l don't know.
l haven't thought about it much.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.096
l think maybe you could use a crane
or something.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.600
Yeah? l could dig a ramp.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.102
Knock that wall out
and hoist it out of here.

19:47.062 --> 19:51.691
l went sailing once with my dad
and Commander Wilder.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.610
Didn't go too well.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.029
- Did you get seasick?
- My dad did.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.199
Commander Wilder thought
it was funny.

20:00.450 --> 20:03.703
You know,
my dad being in the Navy and all.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.038
Yeah.

20:05.538 --> 20:09.417
- You're going to find him, right?
- Oh, yeah. We'll find him.

20:10.335 --> 20:13.129
- Promise?
- Yeah.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.882
l promise you.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.967
Wanna give me a hand?

20:18.718 --> 20:22.347
- Don't know how.
- Come on over here.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.848
l don't wanna ruin it.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.726
You're not going to ruin anything.
Come here.

20:27.227 --> 20:31.064
See, you always want to go
with the grain of the wood.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.149
Put your hand there.
Put your weight behind it.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.986
Back and forth, real even.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.742
- Where's Gibbs?
- Home with Zach. What's up?

20:42.951 --> 20:45.161
Commander Tanner's
bank statement.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.497
Do Americans usually empty out
their bank accounts

20:47.747 --> 20:49.290
before they take children
to the park?

20:49.499 --> 20:50.750
You're kidding.

20:50.917 --> 20:54.671
Savings, checking, money market,
$23,000.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.589
Gibbs is not gonna like this.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.425
Are we solving this case
to please him?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.093
l got a trace
on the Chevy Suburban.

21:00.677 --> 21:03.596
Zach missed two numbers on the plate
but l found the vehicle.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.933
Rental car out of Maryland.

21:07.142 --> 21:10.020
lD's fake. Credit card was stolen.
But that's our other kidnapper.

21:10.270 --> 21:13.106
Does the car have a navigation
system? We could use the GPS.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.984
Two words for you, McGee:
Lo and Jack.

21:16.192 --> 21:17.402
That's one word.

21:17.610 --> 21:21.156
- A what?
- lt's a-- Whatever.

21:21.406 --> 21:24.451
l tracked it down to a parking lot
a couple miles from here.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.287
Good job, McGee.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.123
What?

21:30.290 --> 21:32.292
Come on, let's roll.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.002
Where's the child?

21:34.210 --> 21:37.130
Now, keep your eye on the coin.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.550
Yeah, like his.

21:43.178 --> 21:45.430
Now that, my young friend,
is magic.

21:45.972 --> 21:49.726
Now, a true magician doesn't reveal
the mysteries of his craft

21:49.976 --> 21:52.645
to anyone else
but another magician.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.148
But would you like to learn?

21:56.024 --> 21:57.942
lt's in that hand.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.153
lsn't it?

22:02.989 --> 22:04.574
So it is.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.702
He's quite observant.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.664
Does he remind you of anyone?

22:13.667 --> 22:15.001
Very good.

22:17.212 --> 22:19.464
Got it, boss.
Black SUV, no rear window.

22:19.673 --> 22:22.467
One visible suspect in the vehicle.

22:22.676 --> 22:23.760
Should we take him now?

22:24.552 --> 22:27.347
Wait. l'm almost in position here.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.849
Copy.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.357
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather be partner with McGee?

22:37.524 --> 22:40.276
The two of you seem to click,
and we're about to storm this vehicle.

22:40.527 --> 22:44.197
- Who knows what's gonna go down.
- Don't worry, Tony. l got your back.

22:44.364 --> 22:48.034
My back. Listen, lady, if anybody
is getting anybody's back,

22:48.243 --> 22:49.369
it's me getting yours.

22:49.536 --> 22:50.870
ln position, DiNozzo.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.999
Take him down.

23:20.625 --> 23:23.669
- Ziva, what a pleasure.
- Dr. Mallard.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.672
- Oh, Ducky, please.
- Ducky.

23:26.923 --> 23:28.883
Are you two done
with the name game?

23:29.092 --> 23:33.513
Yeah. Our guest departed this world
only a few hours ago.

23:34.097 --> 23:36.474
But he was in a great deal of pain
before he died.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.142
Seems he was wounded.

23:38.351 --> 23:41.187
Single round.
The bullet lodged under his scapula.

23:41.437 --> 23:43.856
- The shoulder blade.
- Doc, l'm gonna guess

23:44.023 --> 23:46.359
- that slug's from my safe.
- Yeah.

23:46.526 --> 23:52.949
As to the fatal injury, this circular burn
around the entry wound suggests--

23:53.116 --> 23:54.492
A silencer was used.

23:54.659 --> 23:57.412
lt was done in haste by someone
with little, if any, experience.

23:57.620 --> 24:00.915
lf a professional did this,
he would have not left his weapon.

24:01.124 --> 24:02.875
lt's untidy. Marks of an amateur.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.044
lf it were me,
l would have not been so obvious.

24:05.294 --> 24:08.381
There are literally dozens
of effective ways to eliminate a target

24:08.548 --> 24:10.133
without raising suspicions.

24:10.341 --> 24:14.804
Heroin overdose is popular,
but it requires a history of prior use.

24:15.013 --> 24:17.473
Of course, something like insulin
or potassium can be used

24:17.682 --> 24:20.727
to suggest death by natural causes.

24:21.310 --> 24:25.440
l really must ask you over for dinner.
Mother would love to talk with you.

24:25.648 --> 24:28.359
They cleaned house. l wounded him
when he tried to grab Zach.

24:28.526 --> 24:29.986
After that he was a liability.

24:30.153 --> 24:32.864
Once again, l suggest
Commander Tanner may be involved.

24:33.031 --> 24:34.991
All the evidence says
he stole the software.

24:35.199 --> 24:37.535
He cleared out his bank accounts.

24:37.744 --> 24:40.455
He likely killed this man.

24:40.663 --> 24:42.331
From an investigator's point of view,

24:42.498 --> 24:46.753
the pieces fit together quite well.

24:52.050 --> 24:53.551
Or not.

24:55.011 --> 24:57.263
- Abby.
- Ballistics lab, sir.

24:57.513 --> 24:59.265
- Serving in the military?
- No, sir, l was--

24:59.474 --> 25:02.018
- Stop standing at attention.
- lt's good posture, sir.

25:02.185 --> 25:05.730
- What? No Zachster?
- Abby, you're yelling.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.775
- Oh, sorry. Where is he?
- He's upstairs.

25:08.983 --> 25:13.363
He's a cool kid. Reminds me of you.
He's like a mini-Gibbs.

25:13.571 --> 25:16.532
- Austin Powers?
- You calling Zach a Mini-Me?

25:16.699 --> 25:19.285
Gibbs, l am so impressed
with your pop-culture reference.

25:19.494 --> 25:20.703
Tell me about the weapon.

25:20.912 --> 25:22.205
All right. lt's a Makarov .380.

25:22.413 --> 25:25.208
lt matches the hollow point slugs
from the body downstairs.

25:25.416 --> 25:28.628
And this bad boy that we pulled
from his shoulder matches your SlG.

25:28.878 --> 25:30.546
- Any prints from the .380?
- Dead guy's.

25:30.755 --> 25:32.131
- You have something else?
- l have.

25:32.382 --> 25:33.424
- What?
- Chip shaved.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.510
l didn't notice.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.137
He didn't notice?

25:38.388 --> 25:40.598
He doesn't notice
unimportant things, Chip.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.313
Sorry, Chip. Didn't mean it.

25:55.029 --> 25:58.658
- You getting off, director?
- Looking for you actually.

26:02.745 --> 26:05.331
l saw Ducky's report
on the body downstairs.

26:05.581 --> 26:08.584
- That was fast.
- One of the perks of being director.

26:08.793 --> 26:10.586
l get to read all the good reports.

26:11.045 --> 26:13.297
What's next, Jethro?

26:15.591 --> 26:18.177
Finishing this conversation.

26:18.428 --> 26:20.972
- Don't give me a hard time.
- l didn't realize l was.

26:21.639 --> 26:24.475
The man who supposedly kidnapped
Commander Tanner

26:24.642 --> 26:26.352
is lying dead in our autopsy room.

26:26.602 --> 26:30.314
Tanner is looking
less and less like a victim.

26:30.523 --> 26:33.276
You want back in the field again,
Jen?

26:34.152 --> 26:35.445
Tanner has technology

26:35.611 --> 26:38.197
that could set back
our intelligence monitoring 30 years.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.782
Pardon me for taking an interest.

26:39.991 --> 26:43.995
And here l thought you just wanted
an excuse to spend time together.

26:44.203 --> 26:48.499
l just want to know that this is about
more than a fatherless child to you.

26:48.708 --> 26:49.834
Boss.

26:50.043 --> 26:53.296
Didn't you notice we're in the middle
of a conversation, Agent McGee?

26:53.504 --> 26:55.048
Sorry. Should l come back?

26:55.214 --> 26:56.883
- No.
- Yes.

26:58.176 --> 27:01.554
l'm simply trying to solve
your case here, director.

27:02.847 --> 27:03.890
Speak.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.893
Commander Wilder is here.

27:07.101 --> 27:08.978
He works with Commander Tanner
at Q and R.

27:17.362 --> 27:19.197
Commander Wilder.

27:20.031 --> 27:22.158
l went by his house
to grab some stuff for him.

27:22.325 --> 27:26.245
Your agents wouldn't let me in, so
l bought him a Nintendo to play with.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.915
That's the DS.
lt's an excellent system.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.335
l've heard.

27:34.253 --> 27:36.547
This is a hell of a situation.

27:36.756 --> 27:39.133
Zach's been through so much
in his life already.

27:39.717 --> 27:41.219
ls there a reason you wanted
to see me?

27:41.594 --> 27:44.722
Tanner is a close friend.
l was hoping for information.

27:44.889 --> 27:46.683
At Q and R,
they're saying he's a suspect.

27:47.225 --> 27:49.560
Do you know the sacrifices he's made
to serve our country?

27:49.769 --> 27:51.270
l do.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.398
l don't care
what the computer log says.

27:53.606 --> 27:55.358
Commander Tanner is no traitor.

27:55.566 --> 27:57.777
- What's it gonna take to prove that?
- Finding who is.

27:57.944 --> 28:00.530
Then you should look
at Q and R's civilian employees.

28:00.738 --> 28:03.908
They're falling all over themselves
to try and protect their collective asses.

28:05.410 --> 28:07.662
What about Zach,
where's he staying?

28:07.870 --> 28:08.955
With me.

28:09.163 --> 28:12.083
l'm the closest thing he has to family.
l can take him home with me.

28:12.291 --> 28:15.128
Can't do that.
He's under protective custody.

28:15.628 --> 28:17.672
You mean they're after Zach too?

28:17.880 --> 28:19.924
We'll take good care of him,
commander.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.969
l'm just gonna say goodbye.

28:27.765 --> 28:30.643
Boss, so did you tell him
we think Tanner's innocent?

28:30.810 --> 28:33.104
We don't know he is.

28:33.896 --> 28:35.773
Do you have something to say,
McGee?

28:37.692 --> 28:40.570
l've been going through the evidence
we bagged from the vehicle.

28:40.737 --> 28:44.824
Prepaid burn phone. Guess
whose number's on the caller lD.

28:44.991 --> 28:48.453
Frank Connell, Q and R office.

28:51.330 --> 28:54.250
- What the hell are you doing in here?
- l couldn't stop them.

28:54.459 --> 28:57.587
lt's not her fault.
She's overwhelmed by search warrant.

28:59.005 --> 29:01.007
This is out of line.
l've been cooperative.

29:01.507 --> 29:04.302
Explain why you called the kidnappers
from this office

29:04.510 --> 29:05.928
the day the Honor code
went missing.

29:06.137 --> 29:08.681
- That's a ridiculous accusation.
- Denying you were here?

29:08.848 --> 29:11.017
l said in my statement
l was working late that night.

29:11.267 --> 29:12.977
So you made the call.

29:13.603 --> 29:15.521
Someone's tampered
with this hard drive.

29:15.772 --> 29:18.024
Tried to erase the command logs
morning of the robbery.

29:18.274 --> 29:20.860
We had a virus.
lt corrupted thousands of files.

29:21.027 --> 29:23.529
- ls that what happened?
- Can't tell until we get to the lab.

29:24.030 --> 29:26.240
Okay, bag and tag.

29:26.449 --> 29:29.369
You cannot remove that computer
from this building.

29:29.535 --> 29:32.872
- Don't worry. You're going with it.
- Go up and call the lawyers.

29:33.289 --> 29:35.166
You have the right to remain silent.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.960
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

29:38.169 --> 29:39.253
Hey.

29:39.462 --> 29:41.714
- Gibbs got Connell talking?
- His lawyer won't let him,

29:41.881 --> 29:44.759
so Gibbs is giving him the old stare.

29:46.177 --> 29:47.762
Gibbs does it much better.

29:47.970 --> 29:49.389
- Apple for teacher?
- For McGee.

29:49.555 --> 29:52.517
He's been very generous with me.
Helping me adjust to this new city.

29:52.725 --> 29:54.143
So you're giving him an apple?

29:54.352 --> 29:56.062
lt's a small gesture.

29:56.270 --> 29:58.398
lf you wanna thank him,
why don't you get him a date?

29:58.648 --> 30:01.734
Gibbs wants to know if you've got
anything he can use on Connell.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.569
Frank Connell's a deacon
at his church.

30:03.820 --> 30:06.155
Never had a moving violation,
let alone a parking ticket.

30:06.322 --> 30:08.866
He calls his mother every Sunday.
The man is spick-and-spam.

30:10.535 --> 30:13.996
The saying is spick-and-span.
Spam is lunch meat.

30:14.706 --> 30:17.917
- What exactly is span, then?
- Span is--

30:19.210 --> 30:20.712
l'll get back to you on that.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.714
ln my opinion,
Frank Connell's not involved.

30:23.297 --> 30:27.385
Good. l'll let Gibbs know right away
because he loves to hear our opinions.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.220
He's distracted by his affections.

30:29.429 --> 30:32.682
- Gibbs doesn't get distracted.
- What do you call it, then?

30:32.890 --> 30:35.351
The boss moves in mysterious ways.
Get this to him.

30:36.853 --> 30:39.564
- Why me?
- l'm gonna go see your buddy McGee.

30:39.772 --> 30:43.276
- Hey, put that back.
- l'm just bringing it to him.

30:51.409 --> 30:52.452
Progress report, McGee.

30:53.745 --> 30:56.873
l think that Frank Connell put a trace
on Commander Tanner's computer.

30:57.081 --> 30:58.458
- Think?
- Well,

30:58.624 --> 31:00.710
l've got scraps of code,
protocols, commands.

31:00.918 --> 31:04.130
He might have put the trace in,
collected Tanner's passwords,

31:04.380 --> 31:05.548
stolen the software.

31:06.049 --> 31:09.093
''Might have'' and ''think''
are not going to make Gibbs happy.

31:09.302 --> 31:12.722
Whoever wiped his files did a good job.
There is nothing left but fragments.

31:13.264 --> 31:15.475
Can't Gibbs just bring Connell
in interrogation?

31:15.641 --> 31:18.353
Not with a $500-an-hour defence
attorney breathing down his neck.

31:18.561 --> 31:19.729
Puts it on you, McGee.

31:19.937 --> 31:22.148
Nothing l have found contradicts
any of the evidence

31:22.398 --> 31:24.609
we have against Commander Tanner.

31:25.568 --> 31:28.613
l'm with you, probie. But he's feeling
pretty strong about this one.

31:28.988 --> 31:32.742
Has anyone considered the fact
that Gibbs may be wrong this time?

31:32.950 --> 31:35.161
McGee, bite your tongue.
Gibbs knows what he's doing.

31:35.411 --> 31:38.164
- We just have to show him love.
- We show the love, Abby.

31:38.956 --> 31:42.168
Just don't want to let the bad guys
get away while we're doing it.

31:43.961 --> 31:45.922
Almost blocked my shot there,
Chipper.

31:46.130 --> 31:48.341
- Ever play ball?
- College.

31:48.508 --> 31:50.677
Yeah? Me too.

31:50.885 --> 31:53.930
- Tony ran point for Ohio State.
- What conference did you play in?

31:54.138 --> 31:57.183
- We didn't exactly have a conference.
- Division?

31:57.392 --> 32:01.437
Not really.
lt was more of an intramural thing.

32:02.271 --> 32:04.482
Skins and moustaches?

32:07.026 --> 32:08.361
What do you got for me?

32:09.779 --> 32:11.197
Chip?

32:11.406 --> 32:12.990
Fingerprint analysis results.

32:17.203 --> 32:20.623
- You're free to go, Chip.
- l don't mind staying late, ma'am.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.876
Go home, Chip, please.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.337
- ls that an order?
- Yes. Go.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.846
l don't know how you concentrate
around him.

32:35.054 --> 32:38.224
l know. No, no, no.

32:38.433 --> 32:41.060
No. l'm too good at what l do.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.813
No, you're not.

32:44.063 --> 32:48.401
- l am. Gibbs is going to hate me for it.
- What happened?

32:48.568 --> 32:50.236
l was following up
on the murder weapon.

32:50.403 --> 32:52.488
- Double-check for anything l missed.
- Was there?

32:52.697 --> 32:54.824
- Fingerprints.
- On the gun?

32:55.033 --> 32:57.160
- On the rounds in the magazine.
- That's great.

32:57.368 --> 32:59.579
Most people get obsessed
cleaning the grip and trigger.

32:59.746 --> 33:01.664
They don't think twice
about the bullets.

33:01.873 --> 33:03.750
Now we've got a nice partial thumb,
a forefinger

33:04.000 --> 33:06.210
- and a perfect index print.
- Amazing.

33:06.419 --> 33:09.339
- Yeah, l know.
- So whose prints are they?

33:10.673 --> 33:12.175
Commander Tanner's.

33:23.310 --> 33:24.728
Yeah.

33:24.936 --> 33:28.273
Yeah. At this rate we'll have her
seaworthy in no time.

33:29.316 --> 33:32.778
Maybe my dad can help
when he gets back.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.199
Hubba-hubba.

33:37.908 --> 33:39.409
Dinner at the White House?

33:39.618 --> 33:40.994
A date, actually.

33:41.203 --> 33:44.164
Must be an important guy for you
to get all decked out.

33:45.749 --> 33:48.835
l'd prefer if you just told me
that you liked my dress.

33:49.044 --> 33:51.088
l haven't decided yet.

33:53.590 --> 33:55.926
Do you mind giving us a moment?

33:56.334 --> 33:59.379
Zach, why don't you go upstairs
and grab a soda.

34:07.762 --> 34:10.891
How long are you planning
on keeping Frank Connell locked up?

34:11.099 --> 34:13.810
You make a house call
to reprimand me, Jen?

34:14.018 --> 34:16.187
You got Commander Tanner's
fingerprints on the bullets

34:16.396 --> 34:18.899
- of the murder weapon.
- Well, l'm not sure he did it.

34:19.107 --> 34:22.902
Why? And don't tell me
your famous gut again.

34:25.155 --> 34:27.032
Zach is a great kid, Jethro.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.159
Doesn't mean
his father's not a bastard.

34:29.993 --> 34:33.580
He might be,
but Zach's our only link to him.

34:33.788 --> 34:36.041
He might make another attempt
to get Zach back?

34:36.248 --> 34:37.876
lf he does l'll be waiting for him.

34:38.083 --> 34:39.793
My dad didn't do anything wrong.

34:43.297 --> 34:45.257
lt's a complicated situation.

34:45.467 --> 34:47.302
- lt's not.
- Zach.

34:47.510 --> 34:50.722
Zach, there is evidence
he did something wrong.

34:50.931 --> 34:52.098
lt doesn't matter.

34:52.306 --> 34:56.186
l know in my stomach
he didn't do anything wrong.

34:56.393 --> 34:58.813
You promised
you'd bring him back to me, Gibbs.

34:59.022 --> 35:00.565
Please.

35:07.948 --> 35:10.367
- Where's Zach?
- Ducky's.

35:11.201 --> 35:15.997
Listen, l spent half the night taking
Frank Connell's hard drive apart.

35:16.206 --> 35:20.335
There's nothing. We need to accept
Commander Tanner sold the software.

35:20.544 --> 35:22.295
l'm not accepting anything.

35:23.296 --> 35:25.674
- Boss--
- Look at this a different way.

35:25.882 --> 35:27.801
l agree. l just talked to the ClA.

35:28.009 --> 35:29.302
They were very cooperative.

35:29.844 --> 35:31.972
- They were?
- He owed me a favour.

35:32.180 --> 35:33.682
How many people owe you favours?

35:33.890 --> 35:36.017
How many dates
does Tony go on a month?

35:38.019 --> 35:39.854
This is from Kosovo
in the late '90s.

35:40.063 --> 35:41.898
The man with the shaved head
is Vincent Pazzo.

35:42.107 --> 35:44.317
The one on the left is Willis Hirst.

35:44.776 --> 35:47.612
They were mercenaries
for the Kosovo Liberation Army.

35:47.821 --> 35:49.656
- Freedom fighters.
- Not exactly.

35:49.864 --> 35:52.200
They worked for a warlord
as specialists.

35:53.285 --> 35:56.121
- What specialty?
- Coercion.

35:56.705 --> 35:57.747
Torture.

35:59.708 --> 36:01.918
But the evidence we have
against Commander Tanner?

36:02.127 --> 36:05.130
This is a covert operation.
Take nothing at face value.

36:05.338 --> 36:07.549
They framed Commander Tanner
as a diversion.

36:08.091 --> 36:09.926
While they torture him
for the access code.

36:10.594 --> 36:12.512
Maybe he won't talk.

36:12.721 --> 36:14.890
Have you ever been tortured,
McGee?

36:15.098 --> 36:18.476
There's only so much torment
a human body can bear.

36:18.685 --> 36:21.104
Strong men break in a few days,
nobody holds out forever.

36:21.271 --> 36:22.731
Not even
Gibbs.

36:22.939 --> 36:25.108
To a trained interrogator,
can be done in less time.

36:25.567 --> 36:27.068
l can get that code in hours.

36:28.612 --> 36:30.030
They've had him for two days.

36:30.238 --> 36:32.574
He's running out of time
if he hasn't talked already.

36:32.782 --> 36:34.159
A few hours, huh?

36:35.327 --> 36:36.953
Give or take.

36:38.413 --> 36:41.333
l'm putting you in a room with
Frank Connell, you have 40 minutes.

36:41.541 --> 36:43.710
- l'd hold off on that, boss.
- Where have you been?

36:43.919 --> 36:46.004
Tracking down the store
where our dead guy

36:46.213 --> 36:48.840
purchased his cell phone.
Not easy, by the way.

36:49.049 --> 36:52.719
The language barrier between me and
Mr. Singh was no piece of cake either.

36:52.886 --> 36:55.222
Once l convinced him l wasn't
going to shut down his store

36:55.430 --> 36:57.432
he gave me his
surveillance video tapes.

36:58.058 --> 37:00.018
- ls this poppy seed?
- Where is the video?

37:00.227 --> 37:03.772
Abby's lab. Sorry, boss.
She's scanning the tapes now.

37:05.815 --> 37:07.400
The phone was purchased with cash,

37:07.609 --> 37:09.653
a week before Commander Tanner
disappeared.

37:10.195 --> 37:12.030
Pause the tape.

37:13.531 --> 37:16.159
That woman's got four phones
in her hands.

37:16.785 --> 37:18.870
Zoom in, Abs.

37:20.580 --> 37:25.168
Oh, yeah. The lips and the angle
of the chin, the curve of the neck.

37:25.377 --> 37:27.921
Okay, we got it, Tony.
She's attractive.

37:28.129 --> 37:30.549
lt's Laura Osgood.
Frank Connell's assistant.

37:30.757 --> 37:32.676
l'll make you a print.

37:36.805 --> 37:38.765
l hate it when they do that.

37:47.607 --> 37:48.650
What's going on?

37:48.858 --> 37:52.112
You bought phones connected
to a robbery, kidnapping and murder.

37:54.864 --> 37:57.534
Her number matches several calls
on the kidnapper's phone.

37:58.326 --> 38:00.412
You're done.

38:00.620 --> 38:03.123
Only way to help yourself
is tell us everything you know.

38:04.958 --> 38:06.042
l want a lawyer.

38:14.134 --> 38:16.219
Commander Tanner's been gone
for 4 7 hours.

38:16.428 --> 38:17.929
lf he's not dead yet,
he soon will be.

38:18.138 --> 38:20.765
Maybe we can convince her
to change her mind about the lawyer.

38:20.974 --> 38:22.517
l can convince her
far more than that.

38:22.726 --> 38:23.768
How long?

38:23.977 --> 38:25.228
Not long.

38:28.899 --> 38:30.400
McGee, are you thirsty?

38:30.901 --> 38:33.403
Come on.
l'll buy you a cup of coffee.

38:48.877 --> 38:52.339
Boss, what exactly is Ziva
doing in there?

38:54.591 --> 38:56.301
l don't want to know.

38:58.428 --> 39:01.139
lt was a three-man team.

39:01.348 --> 39:03.808
l was on the inside.

39:04.017 --> 39:08.438
l put a trace on Commander Tanner's
computer to get his passwords.

39:08.647 --> 39:11.441
l planted the virus using his log-in.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.777
Keep going, Laura.

39:14.027 --> 39:18.031
Pazzo and Hirst grabbed Commander
Tanner to get the access code.

39:18.240 --> 39:21.201
- Who set it up?
- l don't know.

39:21.993 --> 39:25.288
We were contacted separately.

39:25.497 --> 39:29.668
Money was wired. lnstructions
e-mailed on an anonymous server.

39:29.876 --> 39:31.503
Where is he?

39:33.046 --> 39:35.632
Commander Tanner,
where is he being tortured?

39:36.758 --> 39:39.427
That wasn't part of my assignment.

39:41.680 --> 39:45.517
Please, they'll kill me.

39:47.769 --> 39:51.481
lt's a garage near Coleman Park.

40:03.785 --> 40:05.579
- Yeah?
- Code checks out.

40:05.787 --> 40:08.248
- Proceed as planned.
- All right. l'll go clean up.

40:39.821 --> 40:41.448
Clear.

40:43.283 --> 40:44.910
Commander Tanner.

40:46.661 --> 40:49.623
- Zach?
- All right. He's safe. We've got him.

40:51.249 --> 40:53.210
They told me they had him.

40:53.418 --> 40:55.420
lf l didn't give them the code,
they'll kill him.

40:55.629 --> 40:58.006
- You gave them the key?
- l had to.

40:58.215 --> 41:02.302
They had my son.
They showed me proof.

41:02.469 --> 41:03.511
What proof?

41:15.565 --> 41:19.110
Agent Gibbs?
What in the hell's going on?

41:20.487 --> 41:22.572
l'm not resisting.

41:22.781 --> 41:23.865
Too bad.

41:24.324 --> 41:27.702
l could have never hurt Zach.
lt was strictly business.

41:27.911 --> 41:29.371
We'll be sure to let him know that.

41:54.938 --> 41:56.523
Are you okay?

41:56.731 --> 41:58.483
l guess.

41:59.401 --> 42:02.779
Commander Wilder was my dad's...

42:04.239 --> 42:05.699
He was my friend, Gibbs.

42:07.868 --> 42:10.120
l should have known.

42:10.996 --> 42:14.207
l shouldn't have let him
fool me like that.

42:15.083 --> 42:18.378
Zach, sometimes really bad people

42:19.045 --> 42:21.256
are good at fooling you.

42:21.798 --> 42:25.093
Anybody bad ever fool you?

42:25.302 --> 42:27.762
Oh, yeah. More than once.

42:31.433 --> 42:35.478
Someday l'm going to find them
and put them all in jail.

42:35.687 --> 42:38.273
l believe you will.

42:39.065 --> 42:40.191
Zach.

42:40.400 --> 42:43.653
Dad. Daddy. Daddy.

42:43.862 --> 42:45.530
You're all right.

42:45.739 --> 42:47.449
l knew you'd never leave me.

42:47.657 --> 42:51.077
- l'm all right. Everything's all right.
- l love you, Daddy.
