10:16.050 --> 10:18.530
Regina, I'’ve been
down this road.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.315
Take it from me...

10:20.402 --> 10:22.926
Oh, my God, you'’ve got
to try the mushroom caps.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.364
Wait a minute.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.192
Is this an intervention?OTHERS: Yes.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.717
No.But yes.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.197
Weren'’t you listening to me?
I'’m doing great.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.286
Ever since I stopped
going to meetings,

10:35.373 --> 10:38.420
I'’ve had time to go to the gym,
do volunteer work,

10:38.507 --> 10:40.117
and spend more time
at the office,

10:40.204 --> 10:42.250
which has led to a pay raise
and a promotion.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.123
You ask me,

10:46.210 --> 10:48.778
I'’ve got it more together
than any of you guys.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.782
Marjorie,
say something.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.784
This wasn'’t my idea.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.047
I knew this was gonna happen.

10:57.134 --> 11:00.529
You just can'’t accept that there
might be another way.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.574
Come on, Regina, it'’s
only a matter of time

11:02.662 --> 11:05.403
before a couple drinks leads
to a line of blow and boom--

11:05.490 --> 11:07.536
you'’re showing up to
your kid'’s PTA meeting

11:07.623 --> 11:10.408
in ass-less chaps
and a sombrero.

11:12.933 --> 11:16.763
Or your version of that.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.026
You know what, if this is
what it'’s gonna be like,

11:19.113 --> 11:20.331
I'’m out of here.

11:20.418 --> 11:22.203
But where you going?

11:22.290 --> 11:24.988
I'’m moving out of this house
and getting new friends.

11:28.905 --> 11:31.821
We can still stay
and eat, right?

11:41.831 --> 11:43.224
Thank you.

11:45.922 --> 11:48.925
Is he cute, or am I just
wearing horny goggles?

11:49.012 --> 11:50.057
ALL:
Goggles.

11:50.144 --> 11:52.450
RSVPs are coming in.

11:52.537 --> 11:55.410
♪ There'’ll be lots of guys
at the sober dance. ♪

11:55.497 --> 11:57.368
♪ It doesn'’t help
when you sing it. ♪

11:59.022 --> 12:00.415
Look who'’s here.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.157
Hey, Regina.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.159
Oh, my goodness!

12:05.246 --> 12:07.770
What a coincidence.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.293
No it isn'’t.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.687
Ladies?

12:11.774 --> 12:14.951
This is my friend
Marcus Manigault-Dupree.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.126
Marcus?

12:16.213 --> 12:17.737
This is Bonnie, Wendy, Jill,

12:17.824 --> 12:18.955
Christy, Marjorie.

12:19.042 --> 12:21.523
Nice to meet you all.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.525
ALL:
Nice to meet you.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.962
If you'’ll excuse us,
we'’re just gonna grab

12:26.049 --> 12:27.921
a quick bite before we
head back to my place.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.879
For dessert.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.801
Happy holidays.

12:38.888 --> 12:41.630
ALL:
Happy holidays.

12:43.153 --> 12:45.025
Now she has a boyfriend?

12:45.112 --> 12:48.768
You promised me she'’d be kissing
a bum in a dumpster.

12:51.161 --> 12:54.164
But she'’s having afternoon sex
with Marcus Manigault-Dupree.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.601
Give her time.
She'’s going down.

12:56.688 --> 12:58.821
Oh, please,
the only person going down

12:58.908 --> 13:00.910
is Marcus Manigault-Dupree!

13:03.695 --> 13:06.350
[humming a tune]

13:06.437 --> 13:08.222
Unbelievable.

13:08.309 --> 13:10.659
I leave this by the mailboxes

13:10.746 --> 13:12.704
to make it easy for the tenants

13:12.792 --> 13:14.837
to give me a holiday tip,
and all I got

13:14.924 --> 13:16.186
was an Arby'’s coupon
and a Polaroid

13:16.273 --> 13:17.666
of a penis in a Santa hat.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.975
[groans]

13:24.281 --> 13:25.674
Give me that.

13:25.761 --> 13:26.980
No, I want to do it.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.115
Whee!

13:35.292 --> 13:37.207
[knocking]

13:39.296 --> 13:42.212
ALL:
Merry Christmas!

13:42.299 --> 13:45.346
Hey, Mom, look, it'’s the
people from the catalog.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.478
Come on in.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.916
I'’m sorry we'’re early,
but it started to snow in Tahoe

13:50.003 --> 13:51.700
and you know there'’s
nothing like fresh powder.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.615
Oh, you don'’t have
to tell us that.

13:56.226 --> 13:57.662
Merry Christmas, Mom.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.751
Aw, thank you, honey.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.015
I got you a perfume that'’s
a little less obvious.

14:03.581 --> 14:04.974
[laughs]

14:05.061 --> 14:06.846
Oh, where does he get it?

14:08.935 --> 14:10.850
And these are
for you and Christy.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.156
Oh, wow, how unexpected.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.724
Oh, please, don'’t feel bad if
you didn'’t get anything for us.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.247
We don'’t.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.423
Don'’t be silly, Mom.

14:19.510 --> 14:22.252
Of course we got them something.

14:22.339 --> 14:23.384
Ah...

14:23.471 --> 14:24.907
Here you go.

14:24.994 --> 14:26.691
Merry Christmas
from the Plunketts.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.084
Arby'’s?

14:28.171 --> 14:30.260
Yes!

14:31.958 --> 14:34.047
Roscoe, your gifts
are under the tree.

14:35.526 --> 14:36.876
Can I talk to you for a sec?

14:36.963 --> 14:38.573
Sure.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.184
Here you go.

14:41.271 --> 14:42.403
Santa didn'’t forget
about you.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.102
We need to make this quick.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.843
Candace wants
to hit the road.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.453
She'’s really got you
on a short leash.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.151
You need to man up.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.196
Look at me, Christy.
That ship has sailed.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.199
What'’s going on?

14:56.286 --> 14:59.115
I just want to ask your opinion
about something.

14:59.202 --> 15:00.116
Okay.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.378
You were around

15:01.465 --> 15:03.424
towards the end of my drinking.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.165
A lot of people were.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.297
Paramedics, county sheriff,
animal control.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.647
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.433
But with the benefit
of hindsight,

15:12.520 --> 15:16.176
don'’t you think it'’s possible I
was just going through a phase?

15:16.263 --> 15:17.655
A phase?

15:17.742 --> 15:19.135
You were on a
first-name basis

15:19.222 --> 15:21.181
with the guy who
pumped your stomach.

15:21.268 --> 15:23.444
Oh, yeah-- Phil.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.837
Ironic name.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.622
Where'’s this going?

15:27.709 --> 15:29.667
Are you thinking
of drinking again?

15:29.754 --> 15:31.843
Well, maybe.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.976
My friend'’s
drinking again,

15:34.063 --> 15:35.760
and she'’s doing great.

15:35.847 --> 15:38.198
And look at you, you used
to smoke weed every day

15:38.285 --> 15:40.504
and now you only do it
once in a while.

15:40.591 --> 15:42.854
Yep, just nights
and weekends.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.292
That'’s every day, but moving on.

15:45.379 --> 15:48.991
You still put a tie on
every morning,

15:49.078 --> 15:51.080
you sell cars,
you'’re a great dad.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.864
You'’re thriving.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.302
Those are the exact words
that my pot dealer used.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.436
The thing is,

15:59.523 --> 16:01.569
I think I could do that, too.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.484
Oh, my God, no, Christy.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.877
When you were drinking,
your life was a tire fire.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.836
You'’d disappear
for days at a time.

16:07.923 --> 16:11.231
And then to make things
worse, you'’d come home.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.233
I know, but I thi...

16:13.320 --> 16:16.105
Look. You can do
whatever you want.

16:16.192 --> 16:18.368
But I'’d really
hate for Roscoe

16:18.455 --> 16:20.327
to ever see his
mom drunk again.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.548
Low blow.

16:24.635 --> 16:27.464
Christy, maybe you
haven'’t noticed,

16:27.551 --> 16:30.337
but you'’re doing
pretty great, too.

16:30.424 --> 16:31.468
Thanks.

16:31.555 --> 16:32.861
CANDACE:
Baxter?

16:32.948 --> 16:34.167
Short leash.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.429
[laughs]
Sorry.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.263
[car engine starts]

16:48.137 --> 16:51.749
I just don'’t get why
we'’re apologizing to Regina.

16:51.836 --> 16:54.230
I mean, we tried to help her
and she told us to go to hell.

16:54.317 --> 16:57.146
Well, maybe we should'’ve
left her alone.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.105
She certainly
didn'’t ask for help.

16:59.192 --> 17:01.933
But if she ever does,
we'’ll be there for her.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.501
Hey, Ghost of Christmas
Past, give it a rest.

17:06.199 --> 17:07.722
Isn'’t it a little weird
just showing up

17:07.809 --> 17:09.723
at her new place without a gift?

17:09.810 --> 17:11.769
Should we stop and get her
a bottle of hooch?

17:11.856 --> 17:14.555
I'’m not stopping anywhere
on Christmas Eve.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.906
Jill, those earrings are nice.

17:18.993 --> 17:20.909
Thank you!

17:21.997 --> 17:23.954
Oh, my God!

17:24.042 --> 17:26.958
These are the most beautiful
earrings I'’ve ever seen.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.439
I picked them out.

17:29.526 --> 17:32.964
Happy housewarming/
Merry Christmas.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.618
You really shouldn'’t
have done this.

17:34.705 --> 17:36.403
They look so expensive.

17:36.490 --> 17:39.145
They are.

17:39.232 --> 17:41.277
We just wanted
to say we'’re sorry.

17:41.364 --> 17:44.933
We were way out of line to think
we knew what was best for you.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.804
Even though we do.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.503
Ah, well, we should get going.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.505
Christmas Eve.

17:51.592 --> 17:54.334
You probably
have plans with your fella.

17:54.421 --> 17:57.119
Actually, Marcus is out of town
visiting his folks.

17:57.206 --> 17:59.339
Why don'’t we order in
Chinese food,

17:59.426 --> 18:01.123
and watch some sappy
Christmas movie?

18:01.210 --> 18:02.820
As much good as that sounds,

18:02.907 --> 18:04.996
we'’re going
to Wendy'’s loser dance.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.434
Sober dance.

18:07.521 --> 18:08.522
That'’s what I said.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.656
You wouldn'’t want to...

18:12.743 --> 18:14.615
I wouldn'’t.

18:14.702 --> 18:17.052
But, hey, let'’s have
coffee next week.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.227
Okay.

18:18.314 --> 18:19.489
BOTH:
Merry Christmas.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.578
ALL:
Merry Christmas.

18:23.928 --> 18:27.584
Well, she seems like she'’s
in a good place.

18:27.671 --> 18:29.325
Yeah, I'’m glad we did that.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.110
