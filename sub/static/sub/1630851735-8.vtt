WEBVTT

00:12.333 --> 00:15.041
-Hey, Dad, I did an experiment.

00:15.125 --> 00:18.375
By carefully exposing my turtles
to select doses of radiation,

00:18.458 --> 00:20.041
I've begun transforming them

00:20.125 --> 00:22.791
into a radical, tubular
crime-fighting team.

00:22.875 --> 00:23.708
Like on TV!

00:23.791 --> 00:27.541
Sweetie, that is so inventive
and the cutest little experiment ever.

00:28.125 --> 00:30.000
Are you proud of me?

00:30.500 --> 00:31.708
Ha! Are you kidding?

00:31.791 --> 00:34.125
You just gave those turtles cancer.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.041
-What?

00:35.125 --> 00:36.916
Yeah. What were you thinking?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.708
You just Chernobyled their insides
into turtle soup.

00:39.791 --> 00:40.750
Even Mipsy?

00:41.958 --> 00:43.291
Especially Mipsy.

00:43.375 --> 00:45.208
Mipsy is gonna die, honey.

00:45.291 --> 00:47.250
Oh gosh, what a cute idea.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.958
Stupid but cute.

00:49.666 --> 00:52.708
Okay, kid,
let's go put down your turtles together.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.208
Whoa, look out,
Michelangelo. A cyberbully.

00:58.291 --> 00:59.250
On fleek.

00:59.333 --> 01:01.208
Hey, do you have any cranberry juice?

01:01.291 --> 01:04.750
-Maybe in your secret woman stash?
-Figure out your own mixer, Dad.

01:04.833 --> 01:08.000
I have an important job keeping
the entire world together, remember?

01:08.083 --> 01:11.375
Aw, that's cute.
I figured they would've fired you by now.

01:11.458 --> 01:12.416
I mean, I got canned,

01:12.500 --> 01:16.041
and genetically speaking,
you're half as good as me, so…

01:16.125 --> 01:18.875
Sometimes, the thought that we're related

01:18.958 --> 01:20.250
keeps me up at night!

01:22.041 --> 01:24.166
Classic Ridley rage issues.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.916
You're definitely my girl!

01:26.000 --> 01:28.958
Whoa,
Leo's TikTok is deadass lit!

01:29.041 --> 01:30.583
Jesus, they're still making these?

01:30.666 --> 01:32.375
Yaass, Krang!

01:59.666 --> 02:01.291
Reagan, pick up the phone.

02:01.375 --> 02:03.833
That's right. I changed your ringtone
when you were sleeping.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.916
-Are you gonna get that?
-Pick it up.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.333
Pick it up.

02:10.333 --> 02:13.333
Hey, Reagan,
I think you dropped your smile.

02:13.416 --> 02:15.208
Oh! What have I got here?

02:16.750 --> 02:18.500
Oh God, it's not working.

02:18.583 --> 02:21.458
Ever have those mornings where you start
pulling at the mental thread

02:21.541 --> 02:23.125
that your entire life could be different

02:23.208 --> 02:25.958
if maybe you hadn't been raised
by such an asshole?

02:26.041 --> 02:26.875
Mmm.

02:26.958 --> 02:31.000
No. My drive-to-work Jock Jams megamix
keeps the bad thoughts far away.

02:31.083 --> 02:35.250
Guess I'll just throw myself
into whatever inane job we're doing next.

02:35.333 --> 02:37.750
Probably something dumb
like going to the moon.

02:37.833 --> 02:39.041
Good news, team.

02:39.125 --> 02:41.083
Today, you're going to the moon!

02:42.333 --> 02:44.166
But didn't we fake the moon landing?

02:44.250 --> 02:47.958
It is so hard to keep track
of what's real and what's fake here.

02:48.041 --> 02:49.916
-Hi, Sasquatch.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.166
I can never find an inroad with that guy.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.458
Haven't you watched
the moon-landing orientation film?

02:54.541 --> 02:57.875
Why did we even kidnap Ken Burns
if no one's watched the movie?

02:58.375 --> 03:02.000
In 1962, President Kennedy
had a dream to reach the moon.

03:02.083 --> 03:05.375
Mostly because he'd achieved
every sexual experience on Earth

03:05.458 --> 03:07.625
and wanted to see what space sex was like.

03:07.708 --> 03:11.250
We choose to go to the moon
not because it is easy

03:11.333 --> 03:13.166
but because I am hard.

03:13.250 --> 03:14.208
Ha ha. Nice.

03:14.291 --> 03:18.041
But the lure of casual sex
proved too much for the astronauts,

03:18.125 --> 03:21.833
who created a free-love commune
and refused to return home.

03:21.916 --> 03:24.166
To avoid a national PR disaster,

03:24.250 --> 03:26.708
the shadow government
recruited crisis actors

03:26.791 --> 03:28.458
to play the rogue astronauts.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.916
Kubrick was hired to fake the return trip,

03:31.000 --> 03:34.083
and the moon
was privately declared a hostile nation.

03:34.166 --> 03:37.541
The rogue colony still exists to this day.

03:37.625 --> 03:38.958
I'm Ken Burns.

03:39.041 --> 03:41.500
If you're watching,
please, someone help me.

03:41.583 --> 03:42.666
I've been trapped in here…

03:42.750 --> 03:45.083
Blah, blah, blah,
lots of sobbing. You get the gist.

03:45.166 --> 03:48.958
We lost communication
with Aldrin's Moontopia 30 years ago

03:49.041 --> 03:51.458
until today's distress signal.

03:51.541 --> 03:54.041
Ooh,
a deep-space distress call.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.708
Very sci-fi. I'm super invested.

03:56.791 --> 03:59.958
They could be finally willing
to surrender. Or it's a trap.

04:00.041 --> 04:01.125
We'll need two volunteers.

04:01.208 --> 04:04.416
Be warned,
this is a near-suicide mission in space.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.916
You may never see your families again.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.125
-I'm in.
-I repeat, you could die.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.958
I'm already dead inside.

04:11.041 --> 04:12.916
-Road trip!

04:19.041 --> 04:20.708
If I say "slam the jam,"

04:20.791 --> 04:22.458
will you let me live?

04:22.541 --> 04:25.000
-Underwear, T-shirt, plasma rifle…

04:25.083 --> 04:26.166
Plasma rifle.

04:26.250 --> 04:29.875
Ah, I threw it in the trash for ya.
It was based on bad science.

04:29.958 --> 04:31.958
Dad, you can't just throw
my inventions away.

04:32.041 --> 04:34.708
I'm going to the moon,
and I need this to shoot hippies.

04:34.791 --> 04:37.166
Or myself if an alien mates with my face.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.666
The moon? Worst dump I've ever been to.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.708
Yeah, right. When did you go to the moon?

04:41.791 --> 04:44.250
Your mother and I had a life
before you came along,

04:44.333 --> 04:47.583
with low-gravity sex tourism,
when she used to be fun.

04:47.666 --> 04:49.875
Ugh! This is why I'm going.

04:49.958 --> 04:53.125
In space, no one can hear
their dad talk about boning their mom.

04:53.208 --> 04:56.125
While you're up there,
find my sunglasses I left behind.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.000
Ray-Bans, gray lenses.

04:58.083 --> 05:00.500
I was wearing them
during a threesome with your mom.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.083
Do you hear me talking
about the threesome, honey?

05:03.166 --> 05:05.166
Threesome. Three…

05:05.250 --> 05:06.083
She's gone.

05:08.833 --> 05:13.166
T-minus three, two, one. Ignition.

05:22.041 --> 05:23.458
Reagan, pick up the--

05:23.541 --> 05:25.666
Oh God, I can't breathe.

05:25.750 --> 05:28.625
Oh God, I can finally breathe.

05:28.708 --> 05:30.791
What if the moon people
capture and torture us?

05:30.875 --> 05:33.791
Or worse, they mistake me for a god
and ask me to lead their society.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.041
That's too much pressure!

05:35.125 --> 05:39.250
No way an outpost
founded by Moon Manson is still around.

05:39.333 --> 05:42.041
Fifty bucks says
the SOS was triggered by a computer

05:42.125 --> 05:45.541
telling us these idiots
ran out of lube and died.

05:50.500 --> 05:54.000
I'll show you
whose rifle doesn't work, Dad.

05:54.083 --> 05:57.000
-And I'll replant the American flag.

05:57.083 --> 05:58.833
Brett, that's a flag of Rasta Garfield.

05:59.416 --> 06:00.750
Damn it, CafePress.

06:00.833 --> 06:03.125
You've hoodwinked me for the last time.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.500
Wow, Earth looks so different from space.

06:06.583 --> 06:10.791
Yeah, NASA spends a fortune
photoshopping Atlantis out of photos.

06:11.291 --> 06:15.916
The signal's getting stronger.
Keep an eye out for beads and lava lamps.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.625
-Stop right there…

06:21.708 --> 06:24.625
…and welcome yourself to the moon.

06:25.208 --> 06:27.541
-Just the man we came here to see.

06:27.625 --> 06:29.416
Ah! Buzz Lightyear!

06:29.500 --> 06:31.041
Close enough.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.833
Buzz Aldrin,
the first second man on the moon.

06:33.916 --> 06:35.791
Welcome to our little Moontopia.

06:35.875 --> 06:38.083
Yeah, we've seen the sex cult,
Buzz, and we are not…

06:39.125 --> 06:40.333
…impressed.

06:41.166 --> 06:43.458
You're free to roam.
Just stay away from the dark side.

06:43.541 --> 06:45.166
That's where the moon Nazis are,

06:45.250 --> 06:46.750
and they are political.

06:47.458 --> 06:49.500
I wonder what they're gonna do
with the fake Buzz.

06:51.291 --> 06:52.458
Melvin Stupowitz?

06:52.541 --> 06:54.458
Sorry, my friend,
no one here by that name.

06:54.541 --> 06:57.375
Though we are both made from stardust.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.125
Cut the shtick, Stupowitz.

06:59.208 --> 07:00.333
We're from Cognito.

07:01.125 --> 07:03.416
Come on in.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.583
What do you mean I'm canceled?
I took every note.

07:06.666 --> 07:09.791
Why don't I just punch
another conspiracy theorist in the face?

07:09.875 --> 07:12.250
Hey, hey, I could make Buzz more dynamic.

07:12.333 --> 07:14.416
What if the character wore roller skates?

07:14.500 --> 07:16.416
It's over, Melvin.
The real Buzz is coming back,

07:16.500 --> 07:18.416
and we can't have
two Buzzes running around,

07:18.500 --> 07:20.833
especially after three Tupacs got loose.

07:20.916 --> 07:23.458
But I've been Buzz Aldrin
for over 50 years.

07:23.541 --> 07:24.791
I have grandkids.

07:24.875 --> 07:26.333
I'll really miss deceiving.

07:26.416 --> 07:28.291
This isn't a negotiation.

07:28.375 --> 07:30.083
Tomorrow, you're gonna show up at Cognito,

07:30.166 --> 07:32.916
get a new face,
and, if you're lucky, maybe a new role.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.708
I heard a spicy rumor

07:34.791 --> 07:37.000
we're about to start casting
for World War III.

07:37.083 --> 07:40.583
Apparently, this time
the Americans will be the bad guys.

07:49.333 --> 07:50.416
Your Highness.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.750
-Wow!
-I don't understand.

07:52.833 --> 07:55.458
Cognito told me
this was some kind of sex cult.

07:55.541 --> 07:56.708
Originally, yes.

07:56.791 --> 07:58.708
But when my good friend Neil Armstrong

07:58.791 --> 08:01.083
died in the great orgy avalanche,

08:01.166 --> 08:02.583
bless his horny soul,

08:02.666 --> 08:04.791
we decided to turn our sex-periments

08:04.875 --> 08:06.666
into experiments.

08:06.750 --> 08:08.708
-Hi, girls.
-Hey, Buzz.

08:08.791 --> 08:11.416
I've created cigarettes that cure cancer.

08:11.916 --> 08:13.083
And our lack of gravity

08:13.166 --> 08:15.500
damn near slows
the aging process to a halt.

08:15.583 --> 08:19.041
-Thanks for the Moontopia, Buzz.
-Have a great after-moon.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.583
Don't moon-tion it.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.583
Oh, I should probably explain
some of the lunar lingo up here.

08:23.666 --> 08:26.875
See, what you do is you take
a regular word and put "moon" in it,

08:26.958 --> 08:27.958
kind of wherever.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.166
Wow, such a rich culture.

08:33.541 --> 08:35.625
Dagnabbit. That SOS we sent you

08:35.708 --> 08:36.916
was for our energy grid.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.250
Damn thing's on the fritz

08:38.333 --> 08:40.208
since the moon Nazis attacked.

08:40.291 --> 08:43.000
Have you tried shooting them?
It works for Earth Nazis.

08:43.083 --> 08:46.166
My God,
is this a zero-point fusion generator?

08:46.250 --> 08:49.250
Looks like they sent us
just the right person to help.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.666
Oh, thanks.

08:50.750 --> 08:53.500
I'm not used to people
noticing or appreciating my work

08:53.583 --> 08:54.750
in any shape or form.

08:59.750 --> 09:01.791
-Oh no!

09:03.375 --> 09:06.250
Dad?! You fucking stowed away?

09:06.333 --> 09:09.750
Okay, before you get all judgy,
you weren't looking for my glasses,

09:09.833 --> 09:11.583
so this is sorta your fault.

09:11.666 --> 09:14.333
Even in space,
I can't get any space from you!

09:14.416 --> 09:17.333
-At least the locals are happy to see me.

09:18.375 --> 09:20.666
Rand Ridley. I'd kick your ass,

09:20.750 --> 09:23.916
but it looks like 30 years of gravity
have done enough damage.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.666
Wow. Congrats
on making it through a whole sentence

09:26.750 --> 09:28.375
without forcing a moon pun.

09:28.458 --> 09:29.666
You two know each other?

09:29.750 --> 09:33.458
How could I forget the guy who infected
the whole colony with syphilis?

09:33.541 --> 09:37.083
And how can I forget the guy
who slept with my fucking wife?

09:37.166 --> 09:39.666
-What?
-Quit living in the past.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.250
That was 30 years ago.

09:41.333 --> 09:43.041
Thirty years?

09:43.125 --> 09:46.375
I can't believe I'm still dealing
with your bullshit, Rand.

09:46.458 --> 09:48.708
You're almost as annoying
as my weak bladder,

09:48.791 --> 09:50.791
which some say is genetic.

09:50.875 --> 09:51.875
Oh my God.

09:52.375 --> 09:55.250
-Reagan, how… how old are you again?
-Thirty, but who cares?

09:55.333 --> 09:58.333
-Why do you even wanna--
-Just sayin' Buzz and your mom…

09:58.416 --> 09:59.708
…trapped in the '60s.

09:59.791 --> 10:00.625
Oh my God.

10:00.708 --> 10:03.791
-Buzz Aldrin might be my dad?

10:03.875 --> 10:04.916
Moon guards.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.416
Hands off me, moon hippies.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.791
Your bullshit rock orbits my planet.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.000
I'm sorry about this, but your father is,

10:14.083 --> 10:15.541
excuse my moon lingo,

10:15.625 --> 10:17.083
a real shithead.

10:17.166 --> 10:19.666
We're gonna have to restrain him.
Any objections?

10:19.750 --> 10:20.583
Ow!

10:20.666 --> 10:23.125
This won't be the first time
I've arrested my dad.

10:23.208 --> 10:25.000
Just be glad he's wearing pants.

10:28.333 --> 10:31.416
How could you not tell me
that my real father is Buzz Aldrin?

10:31.500 --> 10:34.916
-Because he's not.
-It's been so obvious all along.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.458
Your intelligence, your leadership skills,

10:37.541 --> 10:39.708
your love of leaving footprints on things.

10:39.791 --> 10:41.166
Oh, this is so stupid.

10:41.250 --> 10:44.375
You want a dad who's cool
and handsome and has perfect hair?

10:44.458 --> 10:47.041
Yes. I could be related
to a national hero,

10:47.125 --> 10:48.916
instead of a guy
whose biggest contribution

10:49.000 --> 10:51.791
is the Wendy's bags
I find behind the toilet.

10:55.416 --> 10:57.291
So, are you gonna tell Buzz?

10:57.375 --> 10:59.916
No, not yet. I will not have
two deadbeat dads in my life.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.125
-I need to make sure he's worth it first.

11:02.208 --> 11:04.500
If he is, then my next move is obvious.

11:04.583 --> 11:06.458
Fix the energy grid on his sex colony

11:06.541 --> 11:09.208
so he has no choice
but to love me like a daughter.

11:09.291 --> 11:11.750
I would do the exact same thing.

11:11.833 --> 11:14.125
Daddy issues, yeah!

11:15.708 --> 11:18.458
Reagan, I'm damn happy you agreed to help.

11:18.541 --> 11:21.166
Of course. I just have
a few quick diagnostic questions

11:21.250 --> 11:22.083
about the grid.

11:22.166 --> 11:26.333
So, what is your fuel source
and your relationship to alcohol?

11:26.416 --> 11:27.583
I drink in moderation.

11:27.666 --> 11:31.291
I sleep standing up while jogging,
and you have to stay hydrated for that.

11:31.375 --> 11:34.333
-Betty Crocker Christ!

11:35.833 --> 11:37.916
-What is that monstrosity?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.625
Moonworms.
Where do you think craters come from?

11:40.708 --> 11:42.375
NASA's covered them up for years,

11:42.458 --> 11:44.875
just like
the secret ninth planet Shmercury.

11:44.958 --> 11:48.000
-Thanks for the heads-up, NASA.

11:48.083 --> 11:52.208
I'm the second man on the moon,
but I'll be the first to kick your ass.

11:55.541 --> 11:56.916
Tuck your shoulder, Reagan.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.125
Square your hips.

12:03.500 --> 12:04.416
-Hey.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.125
Incredible shooting, slugger.
You're a natural.

12:07.208 --> 12:09.291
You just wrestled a moonworm.

12:09.375 --> 12:13.083
The only thing my dad wrestles with
is the childproof cap on his Vicodin.

12:13.166 --> 12:16.083
You remind me of myself
but female and younger.

12:16.166 --> 12:18.083
If only there was a word for that.

12:18.166 --> 12:19.583
-Uh-huh.

12:19.666 --> 12:21.750
-Oh, the Moon Day Fair!

12:21.833 --> 12:25.458
How about a detour
for some floating root beer floats?

12:27.166 --> 12:29.083
Goddamn Aldrin.

12:29.166 --> 12:32.208
When I get free, I'll kick his ass
from here to Shmercury.

12:32.291 --> 12:35.750
I'm not a wires expert,
but don't we need those to get home?

12:35.833 --> 12:38.500
Right now I need them
to finish this DNA sequencer.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.875
It'll prove to Reagan
that I'm her dad once and for all.

12:41.958 --> 12:44.041
Ah, an emotional mission. Love it.

12:44.125 --> 12:45.458
Screw you. I-- Wait.

12:47.208 --> 12:50.041
Aren't you gonna tell me
that I'm a deadbeat asshole

12:50.125 --> 12:52.416
who makes Alec Baldwin look reasonable?

12:52.500 --> 12:53.750
Well, you're the genius, so…

12:53.833 --> 12:55.791
…how many wires do you need?

12:55.875 --> 12:57.583
Finally, some damn respect.

12:57.666 --> 13:00.666
Hey, any dad of my friend
is a dad of mine.

13:00.750 --> 13:03.750
All right, let me out
so we can raid the commune for parts.

13:03.833 --> 13:06.625
Come on, it'll be fun.
We can replant that flag.

13:06.708 --> 13:09.833
Okay, but only if you tousle
my hair approvingly.

13:09.916 --> 13:12.500
I still never got that "attaboy" from J.R.

13:12.583 --> 13:13.416
Deal.

13:14.708 --> 13:16.875
This means war.

13:16.958 --> 13:18.333
No, I got a better one.

13:18.416 --> 13:20.041
This means war.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.083
Sound colder.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.416
World War III is gonna be with Antarctica

13:23.500 --> 13:25.583
to get their precious walrus oil.

13:25.666 --> 13:26.916
Ugh. Next.

13:27.541 --> 13:29.625
I thought I told you
to handle the Melvin problem!

13:29.708 --> 13:32.750
-He's just running late.
-He's not late. He's on late night!

13:34.083 --> 13:36.958
So, Buzz, you said you had
something special to share with us?

13:37.041 --> 13:39.458
That's right, Jimmy.
And please, call me Melvin.

13:39.541 --> 13:42.958
I've just been playing Buzz Aldrin
on behalf of the shadow government

13:43.041 --> 13:44.166
for 50 years,

13:44.250 --> 13:46.000
and now they wanna can me.

13:46.083 --> 13:48.666
All the details
are right here in this book I wrote

13:48.750 --> 13:51.583
and the sequel, If I Didn'tNew Moon.

13:51.666 --> 13:52.958
It gets a little steamy.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.291
Son of a bitch.

13:56.416 --> 13:59.625
That midlife crisis actor
is gonna blow my standing with the Robes.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.166
Do something!

14:01.250 --> 14:03.750
Patch me through to sleeper agent 0816.

14:03.833 --> 14:05.625
-Code word, scene break.

14:05.708 --> 14:08.416
Okay, join us
after the break when I will be…

14:08.500 --> 14:10.833
-…recalling Melvin.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.250
Fallon's a sleeper agent?

14:13.333 --> 14:15.291
Why do you think
Fallon laughs all the time?

14:15.375 --> 14:17.166
The CIA broke his damn brain.

14:26.208 --> 14:28.208
Fuck! We finally met our match,

14:28.291 --> 14:30.875
and he's a 92-year-old man
on roller skates.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.750
Reagan, you are a gas.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.583
Well, I sure hope I'm oxygen
and not argon.

14:37.666 --> 14:40.500
-Oh!

14:40.583 --> 14:43.333
There. Buzz's DNA, ripe for the stealing.

14:43.833 --> 14:46.666
Brett, I'm gonna need
your specific talents

14:46.750 --> 14:48.666
to root around in the garbage for it.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.458
Anything for you, Moon Daddy.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.125
Don't call me Moon Daddy.

14:54.041 --> 14:54.875
Ha ha!

14:54.958 --> 14:57.625
Hopefully, in 30 minutes,
Reagan's fake-daddy fantasy

14:57.708 --> 15:00.125
will blow up faster than Apollo 1.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.583
Forgive the expression, Buzz,
but you're so down-to-earth.

15:04.666 --> 15:07.125
Rand has never asked
for my help with anything.

15:07.208 --> 15:09.541
Reagan, don't get stuck in his orbit.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.916
You can do amazing things on your own.

15:12.708 --> 15:15.125
-Done.

15:15.208 --> 15:17.208
Your energy is back online.

15:20.458 --> 15:22.208
Bravo, Reagan.

15:22.291 --> 15:24.125
I'm proud of you.

15:28.166 --> 15:29.541
Thanks, Dad.

15:33.500 --> 15:37.083
DNA results in 20 minutes.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.458
Ah! Stupid thing. Go faster.

15:39.541 --> 15:41.333
There it is! The flagpole.

15:42.291 --> 15:43.666
All right, make it quick.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.666
Night is when the moonworms feast.

15:45.750 --> 15:48.000
This is gonna kill on Snapchat.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.583
Rand, today has been fulfilling

15:50.666 --> 15:52.500
in ways I didn't think possible,

15:52.583 --> 15:55.541
and I was wondering if adult adoption is--

15:59.875 --> 16:02.875
-Wait, what the hell?

16:02.958 --> 16:05.083
-Neil Armstrong?

16:05.166 --> 16:07.333
Buzz said he died of a sex injury.

16:08.166 --> 16:09.083
Oh my God!

16:09.166 --> 16:10.750
Neil Armstrong may be a thief,

16:10.833 --> 16:13.041
but Buzz Aldrin is a murderer.

16:13.125 --> 16:14.250
Where's Reagan?

16:15.750 --> 16:19.083
I have had such a great time
with you today, Buzz,

16:19.166 --> 16:21.791
and there's something
I've been meaning to share.

16:21.875 --> 16:24.000
I have something I wanna share too.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.000
This is phase two,

16:26.083 --> 16:28.625
expanding our city to the whole moon.

16:28.708 --> 16:30.375
Wow, free moon-iversity?

16:30.458 --> 16:31.666
Moon-iversal healthcare?

16:31.750 --> 16:33.625
A living moon-imum wage?

16:33.708 --> 16:35.833
Fuck, we are fucking up on Earth.

16:35.916 --> 16:38.375
But I can't make it happen alone.

16:38.875 --> 16:42.333
Are you saying
you want me to stay up here forever?

16:42.416 --> 16:45.291
Do they really appreciate you
back on Earth, Reagan?

16:45.375 --> 16:47.875
-Does your crew respect you?

16:48.875 --> 16:50.541
Boo!

16:51.083 --> 16:52.291
Does your family?

16:57.083 --> 16:59.041
This could be your destiny.

17:00.583 --> 17:02.000
Okay. What the hell.

17:02.083 --> 17:03.416
-Really?
-Hell yeah.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.458
Earth is overrated.
They're about to nuke Antarctica anyway.

17:06.541 --> 17:09.291
-For the walrus oil, I assume?
-Very valuable oil.

17:10.791 --> 17:12.625
Buzz, I have something to tell you.

17:13.208 --> 17:15.083
-Listen, Buzz, I… I really…

17:16.166 --> 17:18.208
I don't know
how to tell you this,

17:18.291 --> 17:21.291
but I think that I might be your…

17:21.375 --> 17:24.583
-Ah! What the fuck?!
-You were gonna say moon-slut, right?

17:24.666 --> 17:26.833
Wait, what?
Why would I call myself a moon-slut?!

17:26.916 --> 17:29.916
We went over this. You take a word,
and you add "moon" in front of it?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.625
It's like a regular slut but on the moon.

17:31.708 --> 17:33.666
I know what a moon-slut is!

17:33.750 --> 17:36.833
I have been trying to tell you
that I think I'm your daughter,

17:36.916 --> 17:37.958
you psycho!

17:38.041 --> 17:39.416
But that's, uh…

17:40.041 --> 17:40.875
Wow.

17:40.958 --> 17:43.750
I hope this won't get in the way
of the deorbiting.

17:43.833 --> 17:44.958
The de-what now?

17:53.041 --> 17:54.375
-What the shit?

17:54.458 --> 17:56.416
-Did you just move the moon?
-Negatory.

17:56.500 --> 18:00.041
You did, thanks to those nifty fuel cells
you installed for me.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.208
Ah, shit.

18:01.791 --> 18:05.125
For too long,
the moon has been in the Earth's shadow.

18:05.208 --> 18:09.041
It's time to reveal
our superior society to the world

18:09.125 --> 18:13.125
by finally breaking the hell
out of Earth's orbit.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.708
No moon? There will be no tide.

18:15.791 --> 18:17.541
Half the globe will be flooded.

18:17.625 --> 18:20.250
What will wolves howl at?

18:20.333 --> 18:21.250
Who cares?

18:21.333 --> 18:23.041
You're a fucking psycho.

18:23.125 --> 18:24.875
That's what Neil said.

18:24.958 --> 18:26.916
You may need a time-out.

18:32.541 --> 18:34.375
Moon guards, get her!

18:46.000 --> 18:47.250
Stand down, Melvin.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.000
How did you find me?

18:49.083 --> 18:51.708
It's all in your book.
You ever hear of editing?

18:51.791 --> 18:55.666
I called it a tell-all, and I meant it.
I'd rather die as a fake hero

18:55.750 --> 18:57.125
than live washed-up.

18:57.208 --> 18:58.583
Sweet Michael Bay,

18:58.666 --> 19:00.291
we're all getting washed-up!

19:00.375 --> 19:03.291
-Huh?

19:04.041 --> 19:06.250
-Buzz Aldrin is evil!

19:06.333 --> 19:07.500
Wait, you agree with me?

19:07.583 --> 19:10.166
He's trying to pull the moon
out of Earth's orbit.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.333
And he's villainously horny.

19:12.416 --> 19:14.250
-She knows our plans!

19:14.333 --> 19:15.916
Don't let her get away!

19:21.666 --> 19:24.208
In 15 minutes,
we'll know who the real father is.

19:24.291 --> 19:26.458
In 15 minutes,
the gravitational disturbance

19:26.541 --> 19:28.375
will be enough to drown every continent.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.958
We need to shut down the grid.

19:30.041 --> 19:33.666
That sounds, um, time-sensitive.
Can you guys pimp this thing out?

19:33.750 --> 19:35.125
-Fine.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.416
All I wanted
was a couple of days away from you.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.416
Yeah, and look what happened.
You get duped by a con artist

19:40.500 --> 19:42.500
and almost destroy the Earth
to win his approval.

19:42.583 --> 19:43.916
-Hand me--
-Flush cutters?

19:44.000 --> 19:47.750
Oh, I can't imagine why I chased
a fantasy of a supportive father.

19:47.833 --> 19:50.166
-I need the--
-Spanner wrench. Unsupportive?

19:50.250 --> 19:53.125
I built an entire DNA tester
out of garbage

19:53.208 --> 19:54.583
just to prove you're my daughter.

19:54.666 --> 19:55.541
A nice gesture

19:55.625 --> 19:59.041
if I didn't know it was more about
being right than being my father.

19:59.125 --> 20:00.875
-Can't it be both?

20:04.125 --> 20:05.958
Brett, fend them off
for as long as you can.

20:06.625 --> 20:09.416
DNA results in two minutes.

20:10.666 --> 20:11.750
Here we go.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.083
Get them!

20:19.541 --> 20:22.250
Oh God. Sorry.
Sorry, I don't know how I did that.

20:22.333 --> 20:25.500
Less force on the moon
means their muscles atrophied.

20:25.583 --> 20:27.541
-You've got--
-Earth strength!

20:29.458 --> 20:31.750
Wax on, wane off.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.458
See you crater.

20:38.416 --> 20:41.041
Welcome to Earth… on the moon.

20:41.583 --> 20:42.583
Shit.

20:42.666 --> 20:44.666
Can anyone capture this historic moment?

20:46.500 --> 20:47.791
All done over here.

20:47.875 --> 20:51.208
You know, it's a shame to undo
all the great work you've done here.

20:51.708 --> 20:55.333
The reason I'm always hard
on your inventions is to push you

20:55.416 --> 20:57.083
to be better than I was.

20:57.166 --> 21:00.291
-I maybe should have told you that sooner.

21:00.375 --> 21:02.291
The truth is I'm a sad asshole

21:02.375 --> 21:05.041
who blew his career
and his shot at fatherhood,

21:05.125 --> 21:06.583
and you deserve better.

21:10.250 --> 21:13.000
-No traitor could be a daughter of mine.

21:13.083 --> 21:16.500
Buzz, you are the father.

21:17.666 --> 21:19.875
-Whoa, it's actually true?

21:33.583 --> 21:36.333
Ha ha! Suck my Earth ass, Buzz.

21:39.083 --> 21:41.208
Wait, why is everyone
looking so crestfallen?

21:42.708 --> 21:45.083
-No, it can't be true.

21:45.750 --> 21:48.833
Whether you're my dad or not,
we are taking you back to Earth.

21:48.916 --> 21:51.250
I left Earth to beat a paternity test.

21:51.333 --> 21:53.125
-Not getting suckered in again!

21:53.208 --> 21:56.291
There's plenty of moons
out there to conquer,

21:56.375 --> 21:59.333
and this time I'll be first.

21:59.416 --> 22:01.208
Screw you, asshole.

22:05.041 --> 22:06.958
He tried to kill us. Don't salute him.

22:07.041 --> 22:08.291
He's still Buzz Aldrin.

22:08.375 --> 22:11.041
Just think, how many people
have walked on the moon?

22:11.125 --> 22:12.291
All of us.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.125
A device that can control the moon.

22:16.208 --> 22:18.791
Gotta make sure
this doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

22:19.291 --> 22:20.708
Earth warriors,

22:20.791 --> 22:23.291
you freed us
from the tyranny of the Moon King.

22:23.375 --> 22:24.708
We'll take it from here.

22:24.791 --> 22:26.875
Have fun. Don't invent Facebook.

22:28.625 --> 22:31.291
Melvin, it's time
to let go of the spotlight.

22:31.375 --> 22:34.083
It was never about the spotlight for me.

22:34.166 --> 22:36.166
It was an honor just to play a part.

22:36.250 --> 22:38.333
Oh, just drop me off in midtown.

22:38.416 --> 22:41.041
There's a cattle call
for an adult-diaper commercial.

22:43.291 --> 22:45.541
Gigi, change of plans.
We need Melvin back.

22:45.625 --> 22:47.958
-I hear you loud and clear.

22:48.041 --> 22:49.166
We got renewed!

22:49.250 --> 22:51.833
-My goodness, this is great!
-Hollywood happy ending!

22:51.916 --> 22:54.666
The moon landing was fake.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.541
I am back, folks.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.625
Sweet. Free space dog.

23:03.166 --> 23:05.791
Look, this whole thing with Buzz,
it doesn't matter.

23:05.875 --> 23:08.583
You're the reason why I am who I am.

23:08.666 --> 23:10.833
I'll always think of you as a daughter.

23:11.333 --> 23:13.166
I just hope, in time,

23:13.666 --> 23:16.291
you could still be
a compatible organ donor.

23:16.375 --> 23:19.541
-Hey, this has the wrong microchip.
-What the hell, dill-hole?

23:19.625 --> 23:21.750
I told you to pull out the left microchip.

23:21.833 --> 23:23.083
Isn't the moon like Australia?

23:23.166 --> 23:25.750
Like, everything's upside down,
so left would be right here.

23:25.833 --> 23:27.166
Damn it, Brett!

23:28.958 --> 23:31.833
Rand, you are the father.

23:31.916 --> 23:33.291
-What?
-I knew it.

23:33.375 --> 23:36.041
You got half your mother's genes
and half blessed with mine.

23:36.125 --> 23:39.083
Actually, I tweaked your DNA
in the womb, so it's more like 60/40.

23:39.166 --> 23:41.083
Didn't want you getting
too much of her judginess.

23:41.166 --> 23:43.250
Jesus, Dad, not okay.

23:43.333 --> 23:45.125
Well, obviously, it didn't work.

23:45.208 --> 23:46.166
Come on.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.208
Let's just enjoy the ride home, huh?

23:48.291 --> 23:49.875
-Road trip!

23:55.583 --> 23:57.708
-Hi there. I'm Magic Myc.

23:57.791 --> 24:00.375
If you're enjoying this at home,
we've had some fun tonight,

24:00.458 --> 24:03.125
but the truth is,
the moon landing was real.

24:03.208 --> 24:06.166
So on behalf of Inside Job,
let me just say…

24:06.250 --> 24:09.291
Don't sue us, Buzz Aldrin.
