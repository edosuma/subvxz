>> Jesse: TONIGHT, THE

00:02.778 --> 00:04.647
SHOCKING SEASON FINALE OF

00:04.647 --> 00:06.249
"THE BACHELOR" BEGINS.

00:06.249 --> 00:07.685
>> I AM FALLING IN LOVE AND IT

00:07.685 --> 00:12.556
FEELS SO GOOD!

00:12.556 --> 00:13.724
>> CLAYTON FELL
IN LOVE WITH HIS

00:13.724 --> 00:16.227
FINAL THREE WOMEN.

00:16.227 --> 00:16.861
>> I LOVE YOU!

00:16.861 --> 00:19.578
>> I LOVE YOU,
IS ALSO, RACHEL.

00:19.578 --> 00:20.412
>> IT'S NO LONGER ABOUT ME

00:20.412 --> 00:21.180
FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU.

00:21.180 --> 00:23.649
I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU.

00:23.649 --> 00:24.183
>> Jesse: BUT SUSIE WALKED

00:24.183 --> 00:26.752
AWAY FROM LOVE.

00:26.752 --> 00:27.886
>> IF I'M SHARING YOUR LOVE, I

00:27.886 --> 00:32.424
DON'T THINK I
CAN MOVE FORWARD.

00:32.424 --> 00:33.125
>> IF YOU HAD THIS BIG OLD

00:33.125 --> 00:34.159
RESERVATION, THEN
WHY WOULD YOU

00:34.159 --> 00:37.096
NOT BRING THIS UP?

00:37.096 --> 00:37.796
>> Jesse: AND CLAYTON IS ON

00:37.796 --> 00:41.000
THE BRINK OF DESPAIR.

00:41.000 --> 00:41.600
>> THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS

00:41.600 --> 00:42.101
AFRAID OF.

00:42.101 --> 00:44.303
IT'S OVER.

00:44.303 --> 00:44.970
>> Jesse: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS

00:44.970 --> 00:45.671
TRULY UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE

00:45.671 --> 00:49.208
EVER SEEN ON "THE BACHELOR."

00:49.208 --> 00:49.875
>> I WAS IN LOVE
WITH HER, AND I

00:49.875 --> 00:50.442
AM IN LOVE WITH BOTH OF YOU.

00:50.442 --> 00:51.110
I ALSO WAS INTIMATE
WITH BOTH OF

00:51.110 --> 00:57.683
YOU.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.385
>> I'VE NEVER FELT PAIN LIKE

00:59.385 --> 01:00.753
THIS.

01:00.753 --> 01:06.125
IT HURTS SO BAD.

01:06.125 --> 01:06.859
>> Jesse: IT'S DRAMATIC.

01:06.859 --> 01:07.493
>> AND I DON'T
WANT TO END UP AT

01:07.493 --> 01:08.660
THE END IT WAS
GOING TO BE LIKE

01:08.660 --> 01:11.797
THIS AND MAKE IT THERE.

01:11.797 --> 01:12.698
>> Jesse: IT'S SHOCKING.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.700
>> I WISH I NEVER WOULD'VE

01:14.700 --> 01:15.601
FALLEN IN LOVE.

01:15.601 --> 01:16.435
>> YOU SCREWED
THE POOCH, IN MY

01:16.435 --> 01:16.668
OPINION.

01:16.668 --> 01:18.237
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE
ANYTHING YOU

01:18.237 --> 01:19.304
SAY.

01:19.304 --> 01:22.007
>> I PROMISED YOU.

01:22.007 --> 01:22.941
>> Jesse: IT'S LIVE.

01:22.941 --> 01:27.413
>> I'M SO BROKEN.

01:27.413 --> 01:28.147
>> Jesse: AND IT ALL STARTS

01:28.147 --> 01:31.502
RIGHT NOW.

01:31.502 --> 01:35.906
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

01:35.906 --> 01:42.079
>> Jesse: WELCOME!

01:42.079 --> 01:42.847
THANK YOU!

01:42.847 --> 01:50.054
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

01:50.054 --> 01:54.257
WOW.

01:54.257 --> 01:56.678
THANK YOU.

01:56.678 --> 01:58.113
THAT EVENING, BACHELOR NATION.

01:58.113 --> 02:00.715
I'M YOUR HOST,
JESSE PALMER, AND

02:00.715 --> 02:03.218
WELCOME TO THE TONIGHT LIVE

02:03.218 --> 02:05.487
FINALE OF "THE BACHELOR."

02:05.487 --> 02:08.128
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

02:08.128 --> 02:09.396
NOW, WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THIS

02:09.396 --> 02:13.400
WILL BE THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL

02:13.400 --> 02:15.102
FINALE IN "BACHELOR" HISTORY,

02:15.102 --> 02:15.969
BUT WE DON'T KNOW IS HOW TO

02:15.969 --> 02:17.204
ACTUALLY GOING TO END.

02:17.204 --> 02:19.406
WELL, WE ARE ALL GOING TO FIND

02:19.406 --> 02:24.578
OUT TOGETHER RIGHT NOW!

02:24.578 --> 02:26.213
OF COURSE, LAST
WEEK IN ICELAND,

02:26.213 --> 02:28.982
IT WAS THE BREAKUP
HEARD AROUND

02:28.982 --> 02:29.349
THE WORLD.

02:29.349 --> 02:30.984
EVERYBODY WAS
LOSING THEIR MINDS

02:30.984 --> 02:32.252
ABOUT SUSIE'S SHOCKING EXIT.

02:32.252 --> 02:34.554
OF COURSE, CLAYTON WAS LEFT

02:34.554 --> 02:35.889
COMPLETELY SHATTERED.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.290
CAN HE PICK UP THE PIECES AND

02:37.290 --> 02:39.660
STILL FIND TRUE
LOVE WITH RACHEL

02:39.660 --> 02:39.893
OR GABY?

02:39.893 --> 02:41.361
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO ANSWER THAT

02:41.361 --> 02:43.830
EXCEPT TO SAY,
THAT WHAT YOU ARE

02:43.830 --> 02:45.165
ABOUT TO SEE WILL ROCK

02:45.165 --> 02:47.234
BACHELOR NATION AN END ALL OF

02:47.234 --> 02:52.105
AMERICA RIGHT
DOWN TO ITS CORE.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.373
NOTHING, AND I
MEAN NOTHING, CAN

02:53.373 --> 02:55.842
COMPARE TO WHAT
YOU'RE ABOUT TO

02:55.842 --> 02:58.578
WITNESS TONIGHT.

02:58.578 --> 03:00.547
INCLUDING A ROSE
CEREMONY THAT I

03:00.547 --> 03:02.949
LIKE TO CALL THE ROSE CEREMONY

03:02.949 --> 03:04.785
FROM.

03:04.785 --> 03:05.218
IT'S BRUTAL.

03:05.218 --> 03:08.021
SO I GUESS MY
ONLY QUESTION IS,

03:08.021 --> 03:10.924
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE READY FOR

03:10.924 --> 03:14.428
THIS?

03:14.428 --> 03:23.136
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

03:23.136 --> 03:25.672
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A "YES."

03:25.672 --> 03:27.441
OKAY, DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN

03:27.441 --> 03:27.874
YOU.

03:27.874 --> 03:28.909
HOPEFULLY THE KIDS ARE IN BED

03:28.909 --> 03:29.976
AND THE PETS ARE ALL SAFE

03:29.976 --> 03:32.012
BECAUSE IT IS
ABOUT TO GET VERY,

03:32.012 --> 03:35.015
VERY WILD.

03:35.015 --> 03:38.385
"THE BACHELOR" LIVE IT FINALE

03:38.385 --> 03:45.559
STARTS RIGHT NOW.

03:45.559 --> 04:08.381
â™ª

04:08.381 --> 04:11.284
>> I'M HURT RIGHT NOW.

04:11.284 --> 04:16.790
BAD.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.993
LAST NIGHT,
EVERYTHING BLEW UP,

04:19.993 --> 04:24.664
AND SUSIE LEFT.

04:24.664 --> 04:25.699
AND I FEEL TERRIBLE THAT I WAS

04:25.699 --> 04:31.905
SO UPSET AND ANGRY.

04:31.905 --> 04:32.405
I'M JUST SO MESSED UP.

04:32.405 --> 04:33.640
I'M JUST SO MESSED UP AT THIS

04:33.640 --> 04:34.207
POINT, AND I JUST DON'T KNOW

04:34.207 --> 04:39.579
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

04:39.579 --> 04:40.280
I WANT TO BELIEVE LOVE'S HERE,

04:40.280 --> 04:41.348
BUT IT'S ALL UP IN THE AIR AT

04:41.348 --> 04:43.483
THIS POINT.

04:43.483 --> 04:44.251
I WANT TO BELIEVE
IT, BUT, LIKE,

04:44.251 --> 04:47.254
I DON'T KNOW.

04:47.254 --> 04:47.954
I NEED SOMEBODY TO HELP ME,

04:47.954 --> 05:09.709
BECAUSE I'M SO BROKEN.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.545
>> DID YOU GET SOME REST?

05:11.545 --> 05:15.715
>> A LITTLE BIT.

05:15.715 --> 05:18.919
I JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW, FULLY,

05:18.919 --> 05:23.256
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

05:23.256 --> 05:26.059
>> IT WAS CRAZY.

05:26.059 --> 05:26.827
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW,
TO COMPLETELY

05:26.827 --> 05:28.328
JUST BE BLINDSIDED BY LAST

05:28.328 --> 05:30.197
NIGHT, WITH SUSIE, AND TO FEEL

05:30.197 --> 05:34.534
THAT, LIKE, EVERYTHING THAT WE

05:34.534 --> 05:39.873
HAD MEANT NOTHING, IT JUST

05:39.873 --> 05:41.241
SHATTERED ME AND MY TRUST.

05:41.241 --> 05:41.908
LIKE, IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

05:41.908 --> 05:44.678
SHE TOLD ME MULTIPLE TIMES, "I

05:44.678 --> 05:47.013
WANT YOU TO EXPLORE THE OTHER

05:47.013 --> 05:49.382
RELATIONSHIPS FULLY."

05:49.382 --> 05:51.484
>> AND SO YOU INTERPRETED THAT

05:51.484 --> 05:52.018
AS...

05:52.018 --> 05:52.819
>> FULLY.

05:52.819 --> 05:55.922
THAT'S LIKE, TO ME, THAT'S A

05:55.922 --> 05:56.656
HUGE ASK, TO SAY, DON'T BE,

05:56.656 --> 05:57.357
DON'T TELL ANYBODY ELSE ARE

05:57.357 --> 05:57.991
GOING TO FALL IN
LOVE WITH THEM,

05:57.991 --> 06:00.293
DON'T BE INTIMATE WITH ANYBODY

06:00.293 --> 06:02.329
ELSE.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.096
BUT I TOLD HER, LIKE, I WOULD

06:03.096 --> 06:03.763
HAVE, ALL YOU HAD
TO DO WAS JUST

06:03.763 --> 06:05.532
TOLD ME AT ANY
POINT BEFOREHAND.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.268
AND WHAT MADE ME
FRUSTRATED WAS

06:08.268 --> 06:09.703
THAT SHE TOLD ME, "EVERYTHING

06:09.703 --> 06:11.638
YOU'RE SAYING
MAKES SENSE, AND I

06:11.638 --> 06:14.541
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHERE

06:14.541 --> 06:16.109
YOU'RE COMING FROM.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.744
BUT WITH THAT, I
STILL CAN'T SEE

06:17.744 --> 06:20.180
US MOVING FORWARD FROM THIS."

06:20.180 --> 06:21.047
>> OKAY, SO, WHAT ARE YOU

06:21.047 --> 06:28.121
QUESTIONING RIGHT NOW?

06:28.121 --> 06:29.022
>> SUSIE IS GONE.

06:29.022 --> 06:29.322
SHE'S DONE.

06:29.322 --> 06:30.290
SO, IT'S LIKE, WHERE DO I GO

06:30.290 --> 06:35.061
FROM HERE?

06:35.061 --> 06:35.695
>> TONIGHT IS THE
ROSE CEREMONY.

06:35.695 --> 06:38.598
GABBY AND RACHEL
ARE GOING TO BE

06:38.598 --> 06:39.332
EXPECTING ROSES TONIGHT.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.000
AND THEY WANT TO MEET YOUR

06:40.000 --> 06:40.634
PARENTS, AND THEY WANT YOU TO

06:40.634 --> 06:41.268
GET DOWN ON A KNEE IN FRONT OF

06:41.268 --> 06:44.638
THEM.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.338
>> BUT AFTER EVERYTHING THAT

06:45.338 --> 06:45.972
JUST HAPPENED,
IT'S LIKE, I HAVE

06:45.972 --> 06:47.307
NO TRUST.

06:47.307 --> 06:48.108
MY TRUST WAS RIPPED APART.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.809
I HAVE ALL MY WALLS UP NOW.

06:49.809 --> 06:51.645
BUT ALSO, NOW IT'S LIKE, MY

06:51.645 --> 06:52.612
QUESTION IS, COULD
THEY NOT MOVE

06:52.612 --> 06:54.981
FORWARD AS WELL?

06:54.981 --> 06:56.716
IF THEY HEARD THIS?

06:56.716 --> 06:59.386
IF I LOVE SOMEBODY,
I CARE ABOUT

06:59.386 --> 06:59.986
THEM, I GIVE THEM MY ALL, THAT

06:59.986 --> 07:06.059
MEANS THE FULL TRUTH.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.260
SO, I'LL GO TONIGHT, AND I'LL

07:07.260 --> 07:08.895
TALK WITH THEM BOTH, AND TELL

07:08.895 --> 07:11.097
THEM, "THIS IS EVERYTHING THAT

07:11.097 --> 07:11.698
HAPPENED AND THIS IS WHERE I'M

07:11.698 --> 07:13.967
AT."

07:13.967 --> 07:14.601
AND I WILL BE A
THOUSAND PERCENT

07:14.601 --> 07:17.404
TRANSPARENT.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.104
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW, AFTER THEY

07:18.104 --> 07:19.839
HEAR THAT, THEY'RE
GOING TO MOVE

07:19.839 --> 07:21.341
FORWARD.

07:21.341 --> 07:21.975
LIKE, I KNOW THAT
TONIGHT COULD

07:21.975 --> 07:22.575
BE THE END OF THIS WHOLE THING

07:22.575 --> 07:24.377
FOR ME.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.513
>> OKAY.

07:26.513 --> 07:27.213
SO LET'S PLAY
THE OTHER SIDE OF

07:27.213 --> 07:29.783
THIS, THEN.

07:29.783 --> 07:30.984
WHAT IF YOU GO IN THERE, YOU

07:30.984 --> 07:34.788
TELL THEM EVERYTHING, AND THEY

07:34.788 --> 07:35.288
DECIDED TO STICK IT OUT?

07:35.288 --> 07:37.824
>> IF THEY WERE
TO STICK IT OUT

07:37.824 --> 07:38.658
AFTER HEARING
ALL THAT, I MEAN,

07:38.658 --> 07:40.327
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY
A TESTAMENT TO

07:40.327 --> 07:41.528
THE LOVE THAT WE HAVE.

07:41.528 --> 07:42.128
AND LIKE, THAT, OBVIOUSLY, IS

07:42.128 --> 07:42.696
LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE,

07:42.696 --> 07:43.897
OKAY, LET'S CONTINUE.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.065
>> SO IT'S A BIG NIGHT.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.567
THERE'S A LOT OF
PRESSURE HERE.

07:47.567 --> 07:48.368
SO YOUR GOAL IS TO GO IN

07:48.368 --> 07:50.303
TONIGHT, AND
YOU'RE GOING TO LAY

07:50.303 --> 07:51.604
IT ALL OUT ON
THE LINE IN FRONT

07:51.604 --> 07:52.973
OF TWO WOMEN THAT
YOU'RE IN LOVE

07:52.973 --> 07:56.710
WITH, KNOWING
FULL WELL THAT YOU

07:56.710 --> 07:59.546
MAY RISK LOSING THEM FOREVER.

07:59.546 --> 08:02.615
>> YES.

08:14.436 --> 08:25.552
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

08:25.552 --> 08:27.687
>> Jesse: IT WELCOME BACK TO

08:27.687 --> 08:29.089
THE DRAMATIC TONIGHT FINALE OF

08:29.089 --> 08:29.556
"THE BACHELOR."

08:29.556 --> 08:32.292
WE ARE COMING TO YOU LIVE IT

08:32.292 --> 08:33.526
FROM LOS ANGELES
AND AS WE JUST

08:33.526 --> 08:35.962
SAW, CLAYTON IS STILL REELING

08:35.962 --> 08:36.696
FROM HIS DEVASTATING BREAKUP

08:36.696 --> 08:38.798
WITH SUSIE, BUT WHAT ABOUT

08:38.798 --> 08:39.833
RACHEL AND GABBY?

08:39.833 --> 08:41.034
WELL, THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY TO

08:41.034 --> 08:42.402
THE ROSE CEREMONY
RIGHT NOW AND

08:42.402 --> 08:45.338
THEY HAVE NO IDEA THAT THEIR

08:45.338 --> 08:48.575
WORLD IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE.

08:48.575 --> 08:50.610
GET READY FOR
THE ROSE CEREMONY

08:50.610 --> 08:52.712
FROM.

08:52.712 --> 09:03.957
[LAUGHTER]

09:03.957 --> 09:04.858
>> GOING INTO
THE ROSE CEREMONY

09:04.858 --> 09:05.959
TONIGHT, I'M FEELING NERVOUS

09:05.959 --> 09:07.727
BECAUSE I COULD BE COMPLETELY

09:07.727 --> 09:14.033
BLINDSIDED BY THE
PERSON I LOVE.

09:14.033 --> 09:14.934
I THINK MY BIGGEST FEAR RIGHT

09:14.934 --> 09:17.971
NOW IS THAT HE IS FALLING IN

09:17.971 --> 09:18.571
LOVE OR IN LOVE WITH GABBY OR

09:18.571 --> 09:23.843
SUSIE.

09:23.843 --> 09:24.444
THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT I

09:24.444 --> 09:25.111
WILL BE GOING
HOME AND THERE IS

09:25.111 --> 09:27.714
NO GUARANTEE.

09:27.714 --> 09:28.681
EVEN THOUGH HE HAS EXPRESSED

09:28.681 --> 09:29.916
THESE FEELINGS TO ME, THAT

09:29.916 --> 09:31.651
DOESN'T MEAN THAT HIS FEELINGS

09:31.651 --> 09:34.788
FOR SOMEONE ELSE AREN'T

09:34.788 --> 09:35.054
STRONGER.

09:35.054 --> 09:37.590
I JUST HAVE NO IDEA.

09:37.590 --> 09:39.058
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ALL I NEED.

09:39.058 --> 09:39.659
HE'S TOLD ME HE'S IN LOVE WITH

09:39.993 --> 09:41.561
I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM.

10:23.036 --> 10:24.604
WE WERE ABLE TO
EXPRESS FEELINGS

10:24.604 --> 10:26.973
FOR EACH OTHER
THAT I HOPE STAY

10:34.347 --> 10:35.348
I AM FALLING IN LOVE WITH HIM

10:48.995 --> 10:51.698
CLAYTON DID TELL
ME HE LOVES ME,

10:51.698 --> 10:53.066
BUT I ALSO KNOW
THAT SOMEONE IS

10:53.066 --> 10:59.239
GOING TO GET HURT TONIGHT.

10:59.239 --> 11:01.341
I'M HOPING THAT
HE HAS FINISHED

11:01.341 --> 11:02.675
FIGURING OUT,
LIKE, EXACTLY WHAT

11:02.675 --> 11:04.944
HE WANTS, AND IT'S ME.

12:07.674 --> 12:10.376
WHERE I'M AT.

12:10.376 --> 12:11.010

IS, I DON'T EVEN

12:11.010 --> 12:11.477
KNOW AT THIS POINT.

12:11.477 --> 12:12.211
I'M JUST TRYING TO PREPARE FOR

12:12.211 --> 12:14.080
THE WORST.

12:14.080 --> 12:14.914
BUT THIS COULD
BE THE NIGHT THAT

12:14.914 --> 12:16.316
I FAIL IN TRYING TO FIND LOVE.

TO LET YOU KNOW

12:42.308 --> 12:42.875
WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE I THINK

12:42.875 --> 12:46.546
YOU ALL DESERVE TO KNOW.

12:46.546 --> 12:48.581
LIKE, I'M KIND
OF SHATTERED INTO

12:48.581 --> 12:49.382
PIECES AT THE MOMENT.

12:49.382 --> 12:52.452
AND I'M QUESTIONING
EVERYTHING.

12:52.452 --> 12:55.121
REALLY, THE PERSON
THAT STANDING

12:55.121 --> 12:55.755
IN FRONT OF YOU
RIGHT NOW IS NOT

12:55.755 --> 12:57.223

12:57.223 --> 13:02.195
WITH.

13:02.195 --> 13:03.262
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY IS NOT

13:03.262 --> 13:05.765
GOING TO BE EASY
HERE, BUT IT'S

13:05.765 --> 13:07.066
GOING TO BE VERY
TRANSPARENT AND

13:07.066 --> 13:14.540
I OWE IT TO YOU ALL.

13:14.540 --> 13:16.142
YESTERDAY, SUSIE
TOLD ME THAT IF

13:16.142 --> 13:21.247
I HAD TOLD EITHER
OF YOU THAT I

13:21.247 --> 13:24.117
WAS IN LOVE, OR IF I HAD BEEN

13:24.117 --> 13:28.855
INTIMATE WITH EITHER OF YOU,

13:28.855 --> 13:32.658
THAT SHE COULD
NOT CONTINUE WITH

13:32.658 --> 13:33.726
THIS JOURNEY,
AND THAT SHE FELT

13:33.726 --> 13:37.096
THAT IT WAS OVER FOR US.

13:37.096 --> 13:40.166
AND SO, IT JUST HAD ME

13:40.166 --> 13:42.368
QUESTIONING EVERYTHING ABOUT

13:42.368 --> 13:45.004
WHAT HER AND I HAD.

13:45.004 --> 13:48.107
AND I FELT LIKE
AT THE END OF IT

13:48.107 --> 13:48.741
I COULDN'T EVEN
LOOK HER IN THE

13:48.741 --> 13:48.941
FACE.

13:48.941 --> 13:54.614
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO I WAS

13:54.614 --> 13:56.516
LOOKING AT.

13:56.516 --> 13:57.116
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO ABOUT IT

13:57.116 --> 14:00.453
THIS WAY, BUT
BECAUSE IT BECAME

14:00.453 --> 14:03.423
A DEAL BREAKER, LIKE, I DON'T

14:03.423 --> 14:09.228
WANT THAT TO BE A DEAL BREAKER

WITH US.

14:09.662 --> 14:11.798
THIS IS THE HARD PART TO SAY,

14:11.798 --> 14:16.235
BUT, LIKE, I WAS IN LOVE WITH

14:16.235 --> 14:16.669
HER.

14:16.669 --> 14:17.503
AND I WAS IN LOVE WITH EACH OF

14:17.503 --> 14:18.538
YOU, TOO.

14:18.538 --> 14:19.138
I AM IN LOVE WITH BOTH OF YOU.

14:39.959 --> 14:40.960
I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY TO HEAR.

14:40.960 --> 14:41.794
BUT I DO BELIEVE, LIKE, THAT

14:41.794 --> 14:45.298
THERE IS A LIGHT AT THE END OF

14:45.298 --> 14:47.333
THE TUNNEL.

14:47.333 --> 14:48.935

YOU BEING ON THE

14:48.935 --> 14:49.469

GO THROUGH.

22:15.837 --> 22:23.879
RELATIONSHIP ON HALF-TRUTHS OR

22:23.879 --> 22:24.546
WITHHOLDING INFORMATION.

22:24.546 --> 22:28.650
BUT I DIDN'T SEE ANY OTHER WAY

22:28.650 --> 22:29.618
TO DO IT THAN THIS.

22:29.618 --> 22:30.452
AND I'M SORRY
THAT THIS IS WHAT

22:30.452 --> 22:31.052
IT'S COME TO, BUT I WANT THERE

22:31.052 --> 22:31.620
TO BE NO QUESTIONS ABOUT US.

22:31.620 --> 22:32.921
>> YEAH.

22:32.921 --> 22:35.423
BUT, LIKE, HOW DO YOU WEIGH,

22:35.423 --> 22:37.526
LIKE, YOUR WORDS, AND THEN THE

22:37.526 --> 22:39.528
POTENTIAL OF LIKE, ME GOING

22:39.528 --> 22:40.462
HOME?

22:40.462 --> 22:42.030
>> IF I SENT YOU HOME AFTER I

22:42.030 --> 22:44.132
TOLD YOU I WAS
IN LOVE WITH YOU?

22:44.132 --> 22:45.166
I MEAN EVERYTHING I SAY.

22:45.166 --> 22:46.401
>> BUT HOW DO YOU, LIKE, BACK

22:46.401 --> 22:48.169
THAT UP?

22:48.169 --> 22:50.338
>> BECAUSE, ULTIMATELY, LIKE,

22:50.338 --> 22:51.740
WHO EVER I PICKED, I LOVE THE

22:51.740 --> 22:53.909
MOST.

22:53.909 --> 23:06.354
>> YEAH.

23:06.354 --> 23:07.122
>> THAT'S WHAT
I'M FIGURING OUT.

23:07.122 --> 23:07.722
LIKE, WHO IS THE BEST FIT FOR

23:07.722 --> 23:07.889
ME?

23:07.889 --> 23:08.390
WHO DO I LOVE THE MOST?

23:08.390 --> 23:09.157
AND ONE I MAKE THAT DECISION,

23:09.157 --> 23:09.925
ALL THE OTHER
LOVE, IT WAS REAL,

23:09.925 --> 23:11.660
BUT IT ENDS THERE.

23:11.660 --> 23:13.361
IT DIDN'T MEAN I
DIDN'T MEAN IT,

23:13.361 --> 23:18.033
IT JUST MEANT I HAD A STRONGER

23:18.033 --> 23:20.635
LOVE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

23:20.635 --> 23:21.303
>> YEAH, IT IS, LIKE, HARD TO

23:21.303 --> 23:23.905
HEAR.

23:23.905 --> 23:27.042
LIKE, WHY WOULDN'T
YOU JUST SAVE

23:27.042 --> 23:28.677
IT?

23:28.677 --> 23:32.581
>> BECAUSE I FELT IT.

23:32.581 --> 23:33.848
IT'S REAL FEELINGS.

23:33.848 --> 23:35.617
LIKE, I AM IN LOVE.

23:35.617 --> 23:37.886
LIKE, I AM.

23:37.886 --> 23:40.155
AND ULTIMATELY, I WALK OUT OF

23:40.155 --> 23:44.125
HERE WITH ONLY ONE LOVE.

23:44.125 --> 23:44.826
>> YEAH, LIKE,
WHICH IS GREAT IF

23:44.826 --> 23:45.460
I'M AT THE END,
BUT WHAT IF I'M

23:45.460 --> 23:47.896
NOT?

23:47.896 --> 23:51.366
LIKE, I'M JUST
SUPPOSED TO STOP?

23:51.366 --> 23:52.000
LIKE, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IN MY

23:52.000 --> 23:58.640
POSITION?

23:58.640 --> 24:03.311
THIS IS [BLEEP].

24:03.311 --> 24:17.525
[HEAVY SIGH]

24:17.525 --> 24:18.493
>> I JUST DON'T
THINK HE'S BEING

24:18.493 --> 24:24.833
FAIR RIGHT NOW.

24:24.833 --> 24:26.601
I DON'T THINK YOU JUST, LIKE,

24:26.601 --> 24:27.602
TELL MULTIPLE WOMEN THAT YOU

24:27.602 --> 24:31.840
LOVE THEM, THINKING THAT THERE

24:31.840 --> 24:32.440
WOULD BE NO CONSEQUENCES,

24:32.440 --> 24:37.045
KNOWING THAT
THERE STILL, LIKE,

24:37.045 --> 24:37.979
STEPS ALONG THE
WAY THAT WE HAVE

24:37.979 --> 24:38.980
TO GET THROUGH.

24:38.980 --> 24:40.115
FOR HIM SAYING,
LIKE, THE WOMAN

24:40.115 --> 24:41.049
I WALKED OUT WITH IS LIKE, THE

24:41.049 --> 24:42.384
WOMAN I LOVE THE MOST?

24:42.384 --> 24:47.689
WRONG [BLEEP] ANSWER.

24:47.689 --> 24:50.291
LIKE, LOVE ISN'T MEASURED.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.961
YOU CAN'T MEASURE IT.

24:52.961 --> 25:00.001
SO, LIKE, DON'T SAY THAT.

25:00.001 --> 25:02.337
I DON'T WANT TO BE LOVED THE

25:02.337 --> 25:02.804
MOST.

25:02.804 --> 25:03.872
I JUST WANT TO
BE LOVED FOR WHO

25:03.872 --> 25:05.407
I AM.

25:25.093 --> 25:27.162
>> I FEEL REALLY HEARTBROKEN.

25:27.162 --> 25:28.697
BECAUSE I LITERALLY NEVER

25:28.697 --> 25:31.433
THOUGHT THERE
COULD BE A CHANCE

25:31.433 --> 25:32.133
HE COULD BE IN LOVE WITH THREE

25:32.133 --> 25:34.703
OF US.

25:34.703 --> 25:38.206
IN LOVE!

25:38.206 --> 25:38.840
LIKE, IT FEELS LIKE IT MEANT

25:38.840 --> 25:40.275
NOTHING.

25:40.275 --> 25:43.311
AND I'M JUST
SUPPOSED TO HAVE MY

25:43.311 --> 25:50.351
HEART BROKEN JUST
FOR THE CHANCE

25:50.351 --> 25:51.252
THAT HE MIGHT LOVE ME A LITTLE

25:51.252 --> 25:51.720
BIT MORE THAN OTHERS?

25:51.720 --> 25:52.353
BECAUSE HE STILL
LOVES GABBY AND

25:52.353 --> 25:52.754
SUSIE.

25:52.754 --> 25:54.656
LIKE, HOW DO YOU EVEN SAY THIS

25:54.656 --> 26:00.395
OUT LOUD?

26:00.395 --> 26:01.196
I JUST NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

26:01.196 --> 26:03.331
I LIKE, NEEDED CLARITY.

26:03.331 --> 26:03.798
I NEED CLARITY.

26:03.798 --> 26:04.132
I DON'T KNOW.

26:04.132 --> 26:12.841
I NEED SOMETHING.

26:12.841 --> 26:17.512
>> DO YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN?

26:17.512 --> 26:32.060
>> I'M JUST IN A LOT OF PAIN.

26:32.060 --> 26:46.875
LIKE, I'M JUST SCARED THAT I'M

26:46.875 --> 26:47.475
ONE TO START PUTTING UP A WALL

26:47.475 --> 26:48.076
BECAUSE I JUST FEEL LIKE LAST

26:48.076 --> 26:51.579
IT JUST FEELS
LIKE IT WAS JUST,

26:51.579 --> 27:00.321
I DON'T KNOW.

27:00.321 --> 27:00.855
>> I UNDERSTAND.

27:00.855 --> 27:01.422
>> IT'S JUST HARD FOR ME TO

27:01.422 --> 27:02.056
IMAGINE BECAUSE I STRUGGLED SO

27:02.056 --> 27:02.624
HARD THIS WEEK, JUST, LIKE,

27:02.624 --> 27:03.191
THINKING ABOUT IT, LIKE THE

27:03.191 --> 27:03.792
POSSIBILITY, AND THEN TO HEAR

27:03.792 --> 27:14.903
IT, JUST, LIKE,...

27:14.903 --> 27:15.804
>> RACHEL, THE
LOVE THAT I FEEL

27:15.804 --> 27:16.404
FOR YOU IS NOT THE LOVE THAT I

27:16.404 --> 27:18.006
FEEL FOR GABBY.

27:18.006 --> 27:21.676
IT'S DIFFERENT.

27:21.676 --> 27:23.011
AND THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.

27:23.011 --> 27:23.611
I KNOW, LIKE, IT DOESN'T MAKE

27:23.611 --> 27:24.145
SENSE, BUT IT'S DIFFERENT.

27:24.145 --> 27:28.082
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

27:28.082 --> 27:31.986
IT'S NOT.

27:31.986 --> 27:36.090
YOU BOTH ARE TWO DIFFERENT

27:36.090 --> 27:36.324
PEOPLE.

27:36.324 --> 27:36.891
I HAVE DIFFERENT FEELINGS IN

27:36.891 --> 27:37.258
DIFFERENT WAYS.

27:37.258 --> 27:37.859
>> YEAH, I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M

27:37.859 --> 27:38.493
JUST STRUGGLING BECAUSE I FEEL

27:38.493 --> 27:39.194
LIKE I'VE BEEN WAITING TO HEAR

27:39.194 --> 27:40.929
IT FROM YOU FOR
SO LONG AND THEN

27:40.929 --> 27:42.330
I DID AND THEN, LIKE, THE NEXT

27:42.330 --> 27:45.466
TIME I SEE YOU, HERE, FOR TWO

27:45.466 --> 27:52.040
OTHER PEOPLE, I DON'T KNOW HOW

27:52.040 --> 27:53.141
TO EXPRESS THAT FEELING.

27:53.141 --> 27:55.176
>> I KNOW.

27:55.176 --> 28:03.518
>> LIKE, I JUST,
LIKE, AM SO IN

28:03.518 --> 28:14.696
LOVE WITH YOU.

28:14.696 --> 28:15.296
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE MY HEART'S

28:15.296 --> 28:15.797
BREAKING.

28:15.797 --> 28:24.839
[CRYING]

28:24.839 --> 28:26.474
IT JUST, I NEVER
THOUGHT, IN THE

28:26.474 --> 28:31.112
WORST-CASE SCENARIO, IT'S JUST

28:31.112 --> 28:32.046
SO HARD TO, LIKE, UNDERSTAND,

28:32.046 --> 28:34.048
LIKE, THE LOVE
THAT I FEEL, THAT

28:34.048 --> 28:37.852
YOU CAN FEEL FOR THREE PEOPLE.

28:37.852 --> 28:50.298
IT'S JUST SO HARD.

28:50.298 --> 28:53.501
>> I KNOW.

28:53.501 --> 28:54.802
IT COULD, LIKE, WE COULD BE AT

28:54.802 --> 28:56.104
THE END OF THIS, TOO.

28:56.104 --> 28:58.907
LIKE, THIS ISN'T OVER, UNLESS

28:58.907 --> 29:00.341
YOU FEEL LIKE IT NEEDS TO BE.

29:00.341 --> 29:04.112
BUT FOR ME, IT'S LIKE, I FEEL

29:04.112 --> 29:07.582
LIKE THIS IS WORTH
FIGHTING FOR.

29:07.582 --> 29:08.983
AND I LOVE YOU.

29:08.983 --> 29:11.052
I DO.

29:11.052 --> 29:13.054
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE.

29:13.054 --> 29:13.788
AND THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT

29:13.788 --> 29:30.905
IT.

29:30.905 --> 29:31.406
>> I KNOW.

29:31.406 --> 29:31.906
I'M JUST REALLY SCARED.

29:31.906 --> 29:32.440
LIKE, I REALLY AM.

29:32.440 --> 29:33.341
IT'S JUST, LIKE, SO TOUGH.

29:33.341 --> 29:34.642
BECAUSE...

29:34.642 --> 29:36.110
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE
OUR LOVE IS SO

29:36.110 --> 29:36.844
WORTH IT.

29:36.844 --> 29:56.164
BUT IT'S JUST, LIKE, I DON'T

29:56.164 --> 29:56.464
KNOW...

29:56.464 --> 29:57.131
>> I JUST WANT
US TO TAKE IT DAY

29:57.131 --> 29:57.432
BY DAY.

29:57.432 --> 29:57.832
MY FAMILY IS HERE.

29:57.832 --> 29:58.566
I WANT YOU TO MEET THEM.

29:58.566 --> 29:59.100
I CARE ABOUT YOU SO MUCH.

29:59.100 --> 29:59.701

29:59.701 --> 30:00.735
BY DAY?

30:00.735 --> 30:04.138
THANK YOU.

30:04.138 --> 30:26.728
>> THANK YOU FOR
TALKING TO ME.

30:26.728 --> 30:27.328
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

30:27.328 --> 30:28.930
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

30:28.930 --> 30:41.109
I'M JUST SO IN LOVE WITH HIM.

30:41.109 --> 30:46.014
IT JUST HURTS SO BAD.

OBVIOUSLY IT'S
NO SURPRISE THAT

WE ARE TRENDING

32:17.597 --> 32:18.031
OF THE WOMEN.

32:18.031 --> 32:18.632
THOSE REACTIONS TELL ME ALL I

32:18.632 --> 32:18.966
NEED TO KNOW.

32:18.966 --> 32:20.267
THAT I DID MESS IT UP.

AND DESPITE WHAT HAPPENED LAST

36:40.026 --> 36:41.228
NIGHT, JUST, KIND OF, OUR

36:41.228 --> 36:44.831
CONVERSATION, AND
WHO YOU ARE TO

36:44.831 --> 36:46.533
LOVE THE MOST IS WHO YOU'RE

36:46.533 --> 36:48.301
GOING TO END UP
WITH AT THE END,

36:48.301 --> 36:49.703
BUT LIKE, I'M NOT IN THE

36:49.703 --> 36:52.105
BUSINESS WITH COMPETING WITH

36:52.105 --> 36:53.673
ANYONE FOR LOVE.

36:53.673 --> 36:59.613
>> IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE A

36:59.613 --> 37:00.180
COMPETITION.

37:00.180 --> 37:00.947
AND I'M SORRY IF
THAT'S THE WAY

37:00.947 --> 37:02.515
THAT IT FELT.

37:02.515 --> 37:03.216
FOR ME, I COMPARTMENTALIZED IT

37:03.216 --> 37:05.585
WHEN I WAS WITH YOU.

37:05.585 --> 37:09.689
AND WHAT I HAVE WITH YOU IS

37:09.689 --> 37:12.092
DIFFERENT THAN
WHAT I HAVE WITH

37:12.092 --> 37:12.659
RACHEL.

37:12.659 --> 37:14.127
BEFORE YESTERDAY
THERE WAS SUSIE

37:14.127 --> 37:14.794
AS WELL AND WHAT
I HAD WITH HER

37:14.794 --> 37:16.396
WAS DIFFERENT.

37:16.396 --> 37:17.030
I KNOW NONE OF
THIS MAKES SENSE,

37:17.030 --> 37:18.331
AND IT'S LIKE,
I CAN'T GIVE YOU

37:18.331 --> 37:20.267
ALL THE ANSWERS
BECAUSE I DON'T

37:20.267 --> 37:23.403
HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.

37:23.403 --> 37:26.106
I KNOW THAT IT'S,
LIKE, AT LEAST

37:26.106 --> 37:29.576
THIS IS MY LAST PLEAD.

37:29.576 --> 37:32.612
AND IF YOU'VE MADE YOUR

37:32.612 --> 37:36.316
DECISION, OKAY.

37:36.316 --> 37:37.384
BUT I SEE SOMETHING
IN US, AND I

37:37.384 --> 37:38.051
WISH I COULD JUST TELL YOU THE

37:38.051 --> 37:38.885
PERFECT THING.

37:38.885 --> 37:39.452
BUT, LIKE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW

37:39.452 --> 37:40.687
WHAT THAT IS.

37:40.687 --> 37:41.321
ALL I KNOW IS
THAT I'M SPEAKING

37:41.321 --> 37:41.655
FROM MY HEART.

37:41.655 --> 37:42.289
>> LIKES, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT I'M

37:42.289 --> 37:42.889
SUPPOSED TO FEEL
AS MUCH AS YOU

37:42.889 --> 37:43.523
DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE SUPPOSED

37:43.523 --> 37:43.757
TO FEEL.

37:43.757 --> 37:45.058
PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES.

37:45.058 --> 37:46.359
AND, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT ANYTHING

37:46.359 --> 37:48.128
ELSE BUT KNOWING THAT YOU TOLD

37:48.128 --> 37:49.963
THREE DIFFERENT
WOMEN, WHICH I'M

37:49.963 --> 37:50.730
ASSUMING BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE

37:50.730 --> 37:52.999
ANYTHING ELSE TO
BASE IT OFF OF,

37:52.999 --> 37:55.268
WITH THE SAME
LIGHT, INTENTION,

37:55.268 --> 37:57.304
VOLITION, EXCITEMENT THAT YOU

37:57.304 --> 37:58.838
TOLD ME, YOU'RE TELLING THEM.

37:58.838 --> 38:00.507
AND THAT'S WHAT MADE MY WEEK

38:00.507 --> 38:02.208
SPECIAL.

38:02.208 --> 38:03.943
>> BUT I FELL IN LOVE IN

38:03.943 --> 38:05.011
DIFFERENT WAYS.

38:05.011 --> 38:06.746
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO

38:06.746 --> 38:07.480
FALL IN LOVE,
AND THAT'S WHAT I

38:07.480 --> 38:08.114
FOUND OUT.

38:08.114 --> 38:09.983
>> WELL, RIGHT,
BUT THEN, AT THE

38:09.983 --> 38:11.985
END, YOU'RE SAYING
THAT, WHOEVER

38:11.985 --> 38:13.420
YOU LOVE THE MOST.

38:13.420 --> 38:16.323
SO THEN, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO

38:16.323 --> 38:18.158
PROCEED IF NOW IT'S ALL

38:18.158 --> 38:18.792
DIFFERENT WAYS,
BUT AT THE END,

38:18.792 --> 38:19.292
IT'S ALL THE MOST?

38:19.292 --> 38:20.260
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE MOST

38:20.260 --> 38:22.395
LOVED.

38:22.395 --> 38:25.365
I JUST WANT TO BE ACCEPTED AND

38:25.365 --> 38:25.565
LOVED.

38:25.565 --> 38:26.566
BECAUSE, LIKE,
YOU CAN'T MEASURE

38:26.566 --> 38:28.401
IT.

38:28.401 --> 38:31.438
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE I'M BEING

38:31.438 --> 38:33.807
MEASURED AND I'VE NEVER, EVER,

38:33.807 --> 38:35.108
EVER FELT THAT WAY UNTIL I'M

38:35.108 --> 38:36.976
STANDING RIGHT HERE.

38:36.976 --> 38:38.678
AND DID YOU LIKE,
REGARD, WHAT I

38:38.678 --> 38:44.084
WOULD FEEL?

38:44.084 --> 38:49.923
LIKE, IT HURTS.

38:49.923 --> 38:51.725
>> I KNOW.

38:51.725 --> 38:56.429
LIKE, JUST SAY YOU'RE SORRY OR

38:56.429 --> 38:56.963
SOMETHING.

38:56.963 --> 38:57.597
>> I AM SORRY.

38:57.597 --> 38:58.298
I'M VERY SORRY.

38:58.298 --> 38:59.532
I'M NOT TRYING TO CREATE ANY

38:59.532 --> 39:03.837
TURMOIL.

39:03.837 --> 39:05.438
LIKE, I'M TRYING
TO DO THIS THE

39:05.438 --> 39:05.972
RIGHT WAY.

39:05.972 --> 39:06.539
LIKE, I'M STILL TRYING TO

39:06.539 --> 39:07.474
CONVINCE YOU BECAUSE I BELIEVE

39:07.474 --> 39:07.974
WHAT WE HAVE A SPECIAL.

39:07.974 --> 39:08.775
SO, IT'S LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO

39:08.775 --> 39:09.876
LET YOU JUST LIKE, WALK OUT,

39:09.876 --> 39:13.813
WITHOUT TRYING ONE LAST TIME.

39:13.813 --> 39:16.649
IS YOUR HEART TELLING YOU TO

39:16.649 --> 39:17.917
WALK OUT THE DOOR?

39:41.049 --> 39:41.683
>> IS YOUR HEART
TELLING YOU TO

39:41.683 --> 39:42.083
WALK OUT THE DOOR?

39:42.083 --> 39:42.617
DO YOU WANT TO WALK OUT?

39:42.617 --> 39:43.151
OR DO YOU WANT TO GIVE IT

39:43.151 --> 39:52.227
ANOTHER CHANCE?

39:52.227 --> 39:55.897
>> I DON'T KNOW.

39:55.897 --> 39:56.431
>> I KNOW IT'S SCARY.

39:56.431 --> 39:57.499
BUT, LIKE --

39:57.499 --> 40:03.471
>> BUT I CAN'T DO THIS AGAIN.

40:03.471 --> 40:04.339
>> I CAN'T TELL
YOU WHAT'S GOING

40:04.339 --> 40:05.607
TO HAPPEN TOMORROW BUT I CAN

40:05.607 --> 40:10.345
TELL YOU WHAT'S RIGHT NOW IS

40:10.345 --> 40:11.779
HAPPENING IS SO REAL.

40:11.779 --> 40:12.380
WHAT WE HAVE IS SO VERY REAL.

40:12.380 --> 40:13.014
AND ONE DAY AT
A TIME, ONE STEP

40:13.014 --> 40:13.648
AT A TIME, ONE
CONVERSATION AT A

40:13.648 --> 40:14.249
TIME, LIKE, I DON'T HAVE A

40:14.249 --> 40:15.383
CRYSTAL BALL, BUT I KNOW, I DO

40:15.383 --> 40:16.384
KNOW ONE THING,
WHAT WE HAVE IS

40:16.384 --> 40:18.253
GENUINE AND REAL.

40:18.253 --> 40:20.121
AND THERE IS LOVE.

40:20.121 --> 40:21.422
AND IT'S WHAT WE
BOTH CAME HERE

40:21.422 --> 40:23.591
LOOKING FOR, AND IT'S HERE.

40:23.591 --> 40:28.029
THIS IS AS REAL AS IT GETS.

40:28.029 --> 40:33.001
IT'S BASED ON WHAT YOU FEEL.

40:33.001 --> 40:34.202
IT'S YOUR HEART.

40:34.202 --> 40:35.570
IT'S WHAT YOUR
HEART IS TELLING

40:35.570 --> 40:36.471
YOU, AND THAT'S ALL THAT I CAN

40:36.471 --> 40:44.078
ASK OUT OF YOU.

40:44.078 --> 40:47.415
>> I DON'T KNOW.

40:47.415 --> 40:47.916
>> OH, MY GOD.

40:47.916 --> 40:48.783
THIS IS THE WORST THING THAT

40:48.783 --> 40:53.488
COULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED.

40:53.488 --> 41:04.365
>> TO PEOPLE HE'S IN LOVE WITH

41:04.365 --> 41:04.933
JUST LEFT AND I'M THE ONLY

41:04.933 --> 41:05.733
ONE THAT'S NOT FAIR TO ANYONE

41:05.733 --> 41:06.267
AND THAT'S NOT HIM OR ME.

41:06.267 --> 41:06.634
DO I STAY?

41:06.634 --> 41:07.602
LIKE, HOW DO WE
MOVE PAST THIS?

41:07.602 --> 41:08.570
LIKE, GABBY JUST PULLED US UP

41:08.570 --> 41:10.972
OUT OF THE SITUATION AND I'M

41:10.972 --> 41:12.240
JUST SUPPOSED TO
BE LIKE, WELL,

41:12.240 --> 41:15.877
I'M THE LAST ONE HERE, BUT NOT

41:15.877 --> 41:22.817
BECAUSE HE CHOSE ME.

41:22.817 --> 41:39.033
THIS FEELS AWFUL.

41:39.033 --> 41:45.206
>> I'M SORRY TO MAKE YOU WAIT.

41:45.206 --> 41:46.107
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

41:46.107 --> 41:52.780
>> YEAH.

41:52.780 --> 42:09.831
>> GABBY.

42:09.831 --> 42:18.973
GABBY, WILL YOU ACCEPT THIS

42:18.973 --> 42:19.874
ROSE?

42:19.874 --> 42:37.692
>> YEAH.

42:37.692 --> 42:38.459
>> WE DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE

42:38.459 --> 42:38.926
ANYTHING TO HIDE NOW.

42:38.926 --> 42:39.560
HE KNOWS THAT I'M
UNCOMFORTABLE.

42:39.560 --> 42:39.927
THAT I'M HURT.

42:39.927 --> 42:41.029
AND THAT I CHOSE
TO STAY DESPITE

42:41.029 --> 42:48.069
IT.

42:48.069 --> 42:48.703
AND LIKE, AS MUCH
AS I'VE CHOSEN

42:48.703 --> 42:51.406
TO BE HERE IN THE PAST, I'M

42:51.406 --> 42:53.308
AND LIKE, I WAS READY TO GO.

42:53.308 --> 42:54.042
>> I JUST WANT
TO SAY AGAIN, I'M

42:54.042 --> 42:55.543
SORRY.

42:55.543 --> 43:01.149
BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT TO EVER PUT

43:01.149 --> 43:01.783
EITHER OF YOU THROUGH ANY OF

43:01.783 --> 43:02.483
THIS PAIN.

43:02.483 --> 43:03.718
BUT UNDERSTAND, LIKE, THAT I'M

43:03.718 --> 43:06.621
FIGHTING BECAUSE I CARE, AND I

43:06.621 --> 43:07.255
DON'T HAVE ALL
THE ANSWERS, BUT

43:07.255 --> 43:09.757
I WISH I DID.

43:09.757 --> 43:10.958
I'M REALLY EXCITED
TO INTRODUCE

43:10.958 --> 43:14.395
YOU BOTH TO MY FAMILY.

43:14.395 --> 43:17.465
WE'LL GO FROM THERE.

43:17.465 --> 43:20.902
I DON'T EVEN FEEL RIGHT

43:20.902 --> 43:21.169
CHOOSING.

43:21.169 --> 43:24.505
I KNOW THIS IS WEIRD.

43:24.505 --> 43:25.206
>> I THINK THERE ARE NO, LIKE,

43:25.206 --> 43:26.874
RIGHT WORDS.

43:26.874 --> 43:29.110
BUT I GUESS, LIKE, IT'S ABOUT

43:29.110 --> 43:31.045
TRUSTING OURSELVES
ENOUGH TO BE

43:31.045 --> 43:36.451
HERE THIS FAR.

43:36.451 --> 43:41.022
>> CHEERS.

43:41.022 --> 43:41.689
>> LIKE, BEING
HERE, I AM MAKING

43:41.689 --> 43:42.323
THE DECISION TO
MOVE FULL STEAM

43:42.323 --> 43:47.962
AHEAD.

43:47.962 --> 43:49.030
>> I'M SO SORRY.

43:49.030 --> 43:49.364
I'M SO SORRY.

43:49.364 --> 43:51.132
>> NOT THAT HE
CHANGED MY MIND,

43:51.132 --> 43:54.102
BUT I THINK HE
ALLOWED SPACE FOR

43:54.102 --> 43:57.271
ME TO FEEL WHAT I WAS FEELING

43:57.271 --> 44:00.441
AND DID, LIKE,
ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT

44:00.441 --> 44:01.943
WE DO HAVE IS SPECIAL AND

44:01.943 --> 44:02.643
UNIQUE, AND I
CAN TRUST TO THAT

44:02.643 --> 44:08.116
MOVING FORWARD.

44:08.116 --> 44:08.683
YOU KNOW, I REALLY LOVE HIM,

44:08.683 --> 44:09.484
BUT, I COULD,
LIKE, KICK MYSELF

44:09.484 --> 44:21.829
NEXT WEEK.

44:21.829 --> 44:25.400
[APPLAUSE]

44:25.400 --> 44:26.434
>> Jesse: THAT IS AN EYE I

44:26.434 --> 44:28.169
WILL NEVER FORGET.

44:28.169 --> 44:29.003
I KNOW I GOT MY
OWN OPINIONS ON

44:29.003 --> 44:32.440
ALL OF THIS, BUT HOW DOES

44:32.440 --> 44:33.207
BACHELOR NATION FEEL ABOUT IT

44:33.207 --> 44:33.374
ALL?

44:33.374 --> 44:34.242
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT IN A

44:34.242 --> 44:35.143
MINUTE WHEN SOME OF YOUR

44:35.143 --> 44:36.144

44:36.144 --> 44:39.647
LET'S JOIN ME
RIGHT HERE, THAT'S

44:39.647 --> 44:41.182
BEFORE, TO.

44:41.182 --> 44:41.816
THAT'S RIGHT.

44:41.816 --> 44:43.751
AND THEN IT LATER,
JUST WHEN YOU

44:43.751 --> 44:45.620
THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS BACK ON

44:45.620 --> 44:47.255
TRACK, JUST WHEN
YOU THOUGHT YOU

44:47.255 --> 44:51.359
KNEW WHERE CLAYTON'S
JOURNEY WAS

44:51.359 --> 44:52.160
HEADED, IT GETS EVEN CRAZIER.

44:52.160 --> 44:54.028
DON'T GO AWAY.

45:03.741 --> 45:10.026
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

45:10.026 --> 45:12.896
>> Jesse: WELCOME BACK TO THE

45:12.896 --> 45:14.297
SHOCKING FINALE OF

45:14.297 --> 45:15.065
"THE BACHELOR."

45:15.065 --> 45:17.534
WHAT AN INSANE
RIDE IT'S BEEN SO

45:17.534 --> 45:19.869
FAR, AM I RIGHT?

45:19.869 --> 45:20.870
JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

45:20.870 --> 45:22.238
AND LOOK, I'M SURE MANY OF YOU

45:22.238 --> 45:24.441
HERE AND MANY OF
YOU AT HOME OR

45:24.441 --> 45:26.443
JUST DYING TO DISCUSS ALL THE

45:26.443 --> 45:27.510
CRAZINESS THAT
JUST WENT DOWN SO

45:27.510 --> 45:30.313
I THINK IT'S TIME WE DO THAT.

45:30.313 --> 45:30.880
SOME OF YOUR BACHELOR NATION

45:30.880 --> 45:39.155
FAVORITES ARE HERE.

45:39.155 --> 45:41.391
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

45:41.391 --> 45:42.826
IT IS SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU ALL

45:42.826 --> 45:43.026
HERE.

45:43.026 --> 45:43.960
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING

45:43.960 --> 45:44.194
HERE.

45:44.194 --> 45:45.829
I WANT TO DIVE RIGHT INTO THIS

45:45.829 --> 45:47.931
BECAUSE I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR

45:47.931 --> 45:49.232
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO SAY.

45:49.232 --> 45:49.966
THAT WAS THE CRAZIEST ROSE

45:49.966 --> 45:50.867
CEREMONY OF ALL TIME.

45:50.867 --> 45:53.069
HOW DO YOU THINK
CLAYTON HANDLE

45:53.069 --> 45:54.437
THAT?

45:54.437 --> 45:56.239
>> IF I'M BEING HONEST, NOT

45:56.239 --> 45:56.439
WELL.

45:56.439 --> 45:58.308
NOT WELL AT ALL.

45:58.308 --> 46:01.244
IT'S TOUGH TO WATCH.

46:01.244 --> 46:02.412
IT'S TOUGH TO BE
ON OUR SIDE OF

46:02.412 --> 46:03.046
IT.

46:03.046 --> 46:05.348
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS

46:05.348 --> 46:05.548
LIKE.

46:05.548 --> 46:07.917
BUT WATCHING IT
IS EXCRUCIATING.

46:07.917 --> 46:09.586
I THINK IT'S CRINGING.

46:09.586 --> 46:12.722
>> Jesse: NEXT, CLAYTON

46:12.722 --> 46:14.357
STRATEGY WAS TO BE BRUTALLY

46:14.357 --> 46:15.158
HONEST AT THAT ROSE CEREMONY.

46:15.158 --> 46:17.460
DO YOU THINK THAT
WAS THE RIGHT

46:17.460 --> 46:18.595
PLAY?

46:18.595 --> 46:19.963
>> UNFORTUNATELY, HE LEFT OUT

46:19.963 --> 46:21.431
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHICH

46:21.431 --> 46:23.166
WAS THAT HE TOLD SUSIE THAT HE

46:23.166 --> 46:25.235
LOVED HER THE MOST.

46:25.235 --> 46:27.103
AND I FEEL LIKE THAT WOULD BE

46:27.103 --> 46:29.172
SOMETHING THAT
THESE WOMEN WOULD

46:29.172 --> 46:30.106
WANT TO HEAR,
ESPECIALLY GABBY,

46:30.106 --> 46:31.841
WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE

46:31.841 --> 46:33.643
HER NOT TO TRUST HER GUT.

46:33.643 --> 46:35.612
LISTEN, I THINK CLAYTON MIGHT

46:35.612 --> 46:37.414
HAVE THE BEST
INTENTIONS, BUT I

46:37.414 --> 46:39.282
THINK HE NEVER
TOOK THE TIME TO

46:39.282 --> 46:40.950
CONSIDER THE POSITION OF POWER

46:40.950 --> 46:42.085
THAT HE'S IN AS
THE BACHELOR AND

46:42.085 --> 46:43.186
HE NEVER TOOK THE TIME TO

46:43.186 --> 46:44.154
EMPATHIZE WITH THESE WOMEN AND

46:44.154 --> 46:46.189
WHAT WOULD BE LIKE TO BE IN

46:46.189 --> 46:47.190
THEIR SHOES AND
UNFORTUNATELY I

46:47.190 --> 46:49.025
THINK YOU'RE
SEEING A GUY WHO IS

46:49.025 --> 46:49.859
FOCUSED ON FINDING LOVE FOR

46:49.859 --> 46:51.828
HIMSELF AND NOT FINDING LOVE

46:51.828 --> 46:53.129
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

46:53.129 --> 46:54.798
AND IT'S JUST,
I THINK IT WOULD

46:54.798 --> 46:56.466
GO A LONG WAY FOR HIM TO HAVE

46:56.466 --> 46:57.667
BEEN MORE EMPATHETIC AND JUST

46:57.667 --> 47:00.937
PUT HIMSELF IN THE SHOES.

47:00.937 --> 47:02.038
AND I'M DYING TO KNOW, BECAUSE

47:02.038 --> 47:03.273
IT FEELS LIKE
RIGHT NOW EVERYONE

47:03.273 --> 47:04.841
KNOWS THAT CLAYTON LOVES SUSIE

47:04.841 --> 47:06.943
THE MOST EXCEPT FOR GABBY AND

47:06.943 --> 47:08.411
RACHEL.

47:08.411 --> 47:09.512
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY

47:09.512 --> 47:10.914
HAVE TO SAY
WATCHING THIS BACK.

47:10.914 --> 47:12.382
>> Jesse: WERE GOING TO FIND

47:12.382 --> 47:12.882
OUT PRETTY SOON.

47:12.882 --> 47:14.217
MICHELLE, I KNOW YOU KNOW

47:14.217 --> 47:14.451
CLAYTON.

47:14.451 --> 47:17.053
WHAT'S IT LIKE
FOR YOU WATCHING

47:17.053 --> 47:17.821
ALL THIS UNFOLD?

47:17.821 --> 47:21.825
>> THERE'S NO
HANDBOOK, BUT WHAT

47:21.825 --> 47:24.260
I DO KNOW IS BEING
VULNERABLE IS

47:24.260 --> 47:25.261
A REALLY STRONG
THING TO DO, TO

47:25.261 --> 47:27.864
PUT YOURSELF OUT
THERE AND GIVE

47:27.864 --> 47:28.298
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE.

47:28.298 --> 47:30.567
BUT I THINK IT'S
JUST THIS HUGE

47:30.567 --> 47:32.469
REMINDER THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN A

47:32.469 --> 47:33.737
RELATIONSHIP, WHETHER IT'S

47:33.737 --> 47:35.505
FAMILY, WHETHER IT'S FRIENDS,

47:35.505 --> 47:36.706
AND INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP YOU

47:36.706 --> 47:38.208
HAVE TO HANDLE WITH CARE AND

47:38.208 --> 47:39.509
THAT'S BOTH SIDES
AND BOTH SIDES

47:39.509 --> 47:42.312
HAVE TO BE WILLING
TO PUT IN THE

47:42.312 --> 47:44.347
SAME AMOUNT OF EFFORT AND BOTH

47:44.347 --> 47:45.682
SIDES HAVE TO FEEL HEARD AND

47:45.682 --> 47:46.750
ACKNOWLEDGED AND
I THINK THAT'S

47:46.750 --> 47:49.352
THE ONLY WAY THAT,
YOU KNOW, TWO

47:49.352 --> 47:50.854
PEOPE CAN WORK PAST SOMETHING

47:50.854 --> 47:51.354
LIKE THIS.

47:51.354 --> 47:52.789
>> Jesse: LOOKING TO YOUR

47:52.789 --> 47:54.224
CRYSTAL BALL HERE AND SPIN IT

47:54.224 --> 47:55.225
FORWARD.

47:55.225 --> 47:56.693
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT

47:56.693 --> 47:57.560
CLAYTON ENDS UP FINDING

47:57.560 --> 47:59.729
HAPPINESS AT THE END OF ALL OF

47:59.729 --> 48:02.265
THIS?

48:02.265 --> 48:03.500
>> THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHY WE GO

48:03.500 --> 48:05.068
IN THIS AND SIGN UP FOR THIS,

48:05.068 --> 48:06.936
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.

48:06.936 --> 48:08.705
THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE FOR.

48:08.705 --> 48:09.906
I THINK ONLY HE KNOWS WHAT'S

48:09.906 --> 48:18.448
BEST FOR HIM.

48:18.448 --> 48:21.184
THE REAL PEOPLE
ON BOTH SIDES OF

48:21.184 --> 48:27.090
IT.

48:27.090 --> 48:29.392
I HOPE HE DOES FIND LOVE.

48:29.392 --> 48:31.394
>> I FEEL LIKE
AT THIS PERSON WE

48:31.394 --> 48:33.863
HAVE MORE QUESTIONS
AND ANSWERS.

48:33.863 --> 48:34.831
I WANT TO THANK
YOU ALL SO MUCH

48:34.831 --> 48:38.902
FOR BEING HERE.

48:38.902 --> 48:43.706
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

48:43.706 --> 48:45.508
AND IF YOU THINK YOU'VE HEARD

48:45.508 --> 48:46.075
EVERYTHING FROM OUR

48:46.075 --> 48:48.344
BACHELOR NATION FAVORITES, YOU

48:48.344 --> 48:49.279
HAVEN'T.

48:49.279 --> 48:51.281
WE HAVE A FEW MORE ALUMS WHO

48:51.281 --> 48:53.383
WILL JOIN US HERE,
LIVE, ON THIS

48:53.383 --> 48:57.453
ALREADY CONTROVERSIAL FINALE.

48:57.453 --> 48:59.255
IF YOU THINK WHAT
YOU'VE SEEN SO

48:59.255 --> 49:00.857
FAR IS CRAZY, YOU AIN'T SEEN

49:00.857 --> 49:01.658
NOTHING YET.

49:01.658 --> 49:05.295
DON'T GO AWAY.

49:26.783 --> 49:34.796
[CHEERS AND
APPLAUSE]>> Jesse: O

49:34.796 --> 49:37.639
"THE BACHELOR" LIVE AT FINALE.

49:37.639 --> 49:39.541
SO RACHEL AND GABBY NOW KNOW

49:39.541 --> 49:42.044
THAT CLAYTON IS
IN LOVE WITH AND

49:42.044 --> 49:43.178
WAS INTIMATE WITH BOTH OF THEM

49:43.178 --> 49:44.913
AND SO, THEY BOTH DECIDED TO

49:44.913 --> 49:45.681
STICK AROUND.

49:45.681 --> 49:46.882
WHAT CAN POSSIBLY
GO WRONG WHEN

49:46.882 --> 49:48.484
THEY MEET CLAYTON'S FAMILY?

49:48.484 --> 49:50.152
AND WHAT WILL HIS
FAMILY HAVE TO

49:50.152 --> 49:52.721
SAY ABOUT EVERYTHING
THAT'S GONE

49:52.721 --> 49:52.955
DOWN?

49:52.955 --> 49:54.356
BRACE YOURSELVES
BECAUSE THINGS

49:54.356 --> 50:11.940
ARE ABOUT TO GET VERY INTENSE.

50:11.940 --> 50:12.574
>> CAN YOU GUYS
BELIEVE WE'RE IN

50:12.574 --> 50:12.808
ICELAND?

50:12.808 --> 50:13.475
I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS.

50:13.475 --> 50:14.576
THIS IS JUST AMAZING.

50:14.576 --> 50:16.478
I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT VIEW OUT

50:16.478 --> 50:18.947
THERE.

50:18.947 --> 50:20.349
IT'S JUST GORGEOUS.

50:20.349 --> 50:20.983
>> WE HAVE THIS AWESOME AIRBNB

50:20.983 --> 50:21.650
HERE WITH A WARM
FIRE BEHIND US.

50:21.650 --> 50:22.284
I CAN ALREADY
FEEL THE LOVE AND

50:22.284 --> 50:22.518
WARMTH.

50:22.518 --> 50:23.052
>> I'M JUST REALLY LOOKING

50:23.052 --> 50:25.387
FORWARD TO SEEING
MY BIG BROTHER

50:25.387 --> 50:28.690
WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR.

50:28.690 --> 50:29.558
>> HEY!

50:29.558 --> 50:30.092
>> OH, MY GOSH, I'VE BEEN

50:30.092 --> 50:31.527
WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT!

50:31.527 --> 50:36.799
>> YOU LOOK GOOD!

50:36.799 --> 50:38.333
>> HOW E DOING?

50:38.333 --> 50:44.173
>> I'M EXCITED TO SEE MY SON.

50:44.173 --> 50:44.807
>> YOU LOOK GOOD!

50:44.807 --> 50:45.641
>> I WANT TO SEE
IF HE'S HAPPY.

50:45.641 --> 50:47.676
I WANT TO SEE
HIM FIND SOMEBODY

50:47.676 --> 50:48.343
HE'S IN LOVE WITH THAT HE CAN

50:48.343 --> 50:49.211
SPEND THE REST
OF HIS LIFE WITH.

50:49.211 --> 50:50.446
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT.

50:50.446 --> 50:51.113
>> HOW EXCITED
WERE YOU WHEN YOU

50:51.113 --> 50:51.747
FOUND OUT YOU WERE GOING TO BE

50:51.747 --> 50:54.316
COMING TO ICELAND?

50:54.316 --> 50:55.517
>> OH, JUST TOTALLY EXCITED.

50:55.517 --> 50:57.686
>> IS A PLACE I'D NEVER EVEN

50:57.686 --> 51:02.858
THOUGHT OF BEFORE.

51:02.858 --> 51:03.492
OBVIOUSLY, I'D
HEARD OF IT, BUT

51:03.492 --> 51:04.093
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.

51:04.093 --> 51:06.061
I WANTED TO COME HERE AND TELL

51:06.061 --> 51:08.397
YOU THAT I'M IN
THIS PHENOMENAL

51:08.397 --> 51:11.133
SPOT, AND I'M
LIKE, SO EXCITED,

51:11.133 --> 51:11.767
BUT I'M NOT, LIKE I'M ACTUALLY

51:11.767 --> 51:12.401
REALLY SCARED RIGHT NOW.

51:12.401 --> 51:15.170
LIKE, I'M IN A REALLY, REALLY

51:15.170 --> 51:16.672
BAD SPOT.

51:16.672 --> 51:17.339
AND WHAT'S HAPPENED
IN THE LAST

51:17.339 --> 51:18.907
WEEK WAS, LIKE,
THE HARDEST WEEK

51:18.907 --> 51:22.344
OF MY LIFE, BY FAR.

51:22.344 --> 51:23.045
AND, YOU KNOW,
I CAME INTO THIS

51:23.045 --> 51:26.682
WHOLE EXPERIENCE, AND I TOLD

51:26.682 --> 51:27.282
MYSELF, I'M ONLY GONNA FALL IN

51:27.282 --> 51:27.716
LOVE WITH ONE WOMAN.

51:27.716 --> 51:28.350
I WILL NOT ALLOW
MYSELF TO FALL

51:28.350 --> 51:29.785
IN LOVE WITH MULTIPLE WOMEN.

51:29.785 --> 51:38.660
I WON'T DO IT.

51:38.660 --> 51:39.428
AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH THREE.

51:39.428 --> 51:40.462
GABBY, WHO YOU WILL MEET HERE

51:40.462 --> 51:41.063
SOON TODAY, AND YOU'LL MEET

51:41.063 --> 51:44.633
RACHEL TOMORROW.

51:44.633 --> 51:47.202
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS ONE OTHER

51:47.202 --> 51:51.540
WOMAN THAT WAS HERE, SUSIE.

51:51.540 --> 51:53.709
AND SUSIE TOLD ME THAT, IF YOU

51:53.709 --> 51:56.111
HAVE TOLD ANY OTHER WOMAN HERE

51:56.111 --> 51:57.679
THAT YOU'RE FALLING
IN LOVE WITH

51:57.679 --> 51:58.647
THEM, OR IF YOU'VE
BEEN INTIMATE

51:58.647 --> 52:03.552
WITH ANY OTHER WOMAN, LIKE, "I

52:03.552 --> 52:08.757
CANNOT MOVE FORWARD WITH YOU."

52:08.757 --> 52:10.392
>> MAKES SENSE.

52:10.392 --> 52:11.860
>> AND I TOLD
HER, I SAID, "I'VE

52:11.860 --> 52:13.462
TOLD BOTH THE OTHER WOMEN THAT

52:13.462 --> 52:16.231
I'M IN LOVE WITH
THEM, AND I WAS

52:16.231 --> 52:19.168
INTIMATE WITH BOTH OF THEM."

52:19.168 --> 52:23.872
AND SHE SAID, "I
CAN'T CONTINUE

52:23.872 --> 52:24.473
WITH YOU WHEN YOU'VE DONE ALL

52:24.473 --> 52:24.740
THIS."

52:24.740 --> 52:27.209
>> THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

52:27.209 --> 52:28.877
>> I LOVE BOTH
OF THESE WOMEN SO

52:28.877 --> 52:29.378
MUCH.

52:29.378 --> 52:30.179
I CARE ABOUT THEM
SO MUCH, BUT I

52:30.179 --> 52:34.049
ALSO LOVE THE SUSIE.

52:34.049 --> 52:35.884
I WISH I NEVER WOULD'VE FALLEN

52:35.884 --> 52:36.818
IN LOVE WITH THREE WOMEN.

52:36.818 --> 52:39.388
I KNEW MY HEART DIDN'T WANT TO

52:39.388 --> 52:41.423
DO IT BUT I ALLOWED MY MIND TO

52:41.423 --> 52:42.191
GO THERE, AND NOW THAT I'M

52:42.191 --> 52:43.025
THERE, IT'S LIKE, I [BLEEP]

52:43.025 --> 52:46.195
EVERYTHING UP.

52:46.195 --> 52:46.828
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN BE

52:46.828 --> 52:47.396
IN LOVE WITH, YOU HAVE THREE

52:47.396 --> 52:49.531
PEOPLE.

52:49.531 --> 52:51.500
>> YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT

52:51.500 --> 52:52.367
THEY DON'T WANT
TO BE SECOND OR

52:52.367 --> 52:55.204
THIRD.

52:55.204 --> 52:57.773
THEY WANT TO BE FIRST.

52:57.773 --> 53:00.075
AND I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO STEP

53:00.075 --> 53:00.742
BACK AND SAY,
THEY HAVE A RIGHT

53:00.742 --> 53:02.911
TO BE UPSET WITH YOU.

53:02.911 --> 53:05.447
>> YEAH.

53:05.447 --> 53:08.750
WHEN I TOLD BOTH GABBY AND

53:08.750 --> 53:09.985
RACHEL LAST NIGHT,
THEY TOOK IT

53:09.985 --> 53:13.689
REALLY HARD.

53:13.689 --> 53:14.356
AND THERE WAS
STILL, LET COME OF

53:14.356 --> 53:15.424
THE ROSE CEREMONY, SO I SAID,

53:15.424 --> 53:18.994
"GABBY, WILL YOU ACCEPT THIS

53:18.994 --> 53:20.796
ROSE?"

53:20.796 --> 53:22.097
AND SHE WAS LIKE, "I CAN'T."

53:22.097 --> 53:23.465
AND IN THAT
MOMENT, I WAS LIKE,

53:23.465 --> 53:23.899
"I HAVE TO FIGHT.

53:23.899 --> 53:25.601
I HAVE TO FIGHT.

53:25.601 --> 53:28.303
THIS IS SOMEONE I LOVE.

53:28.303 --> 53:29.871
AND I ASKED HER, I JUST SAID,

53:29.871 --> 53:30.973
YOU KNOW, CAN YOU FIGHT FOR

53:30.973 --> 53:31.173
THIS?

53:31.173 --> 53:31.873
CAN YOU JUST TAKE ANOTHER STEP

53:31.873 --> 53:32.407
FORWARD WITH ME?"

53:32.407 --> 53:36.712
AND SHE SAID "YES."

53:36.712 --> 53:38.413
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

53:38.413 --> 53:39.781
YOU'RE IN A VERY TOUGH

53:39.781 --> 53:40.048
SITUATION.

53:40.048 --> 53:40.649
AND I LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT

53:40.649 --> 53:41.984
HAPPENS.

53:41.984 --> 53:46.355
BUT YOU HAVE SCREWED THE POOCH

53:46.355 --> 53:49.324
IN MY OPINION.

53:49.324 --> 53:54.863
IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING

53:54.863 --> 53:55.364
TODAY.

53:55.364 --> 53:56.131
>> I WANT YOU TO
MEET THESE TWO

53:56.131 --> 53:56.765
INCREDIBLE WOMEN,
AND I WANT YOU

53:56.765 --> 53:57.399
TO ASK WHEN THE
TOUGH QUESTIONS

53:57.399 --> 53:57.866
BUT I WANT YOU TO ALSO

53:57.866 --> 53:58.467
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE GOING

53:58.467 --> 54:00.702
THROUGH A LOT RIGHT NOW.

54:00.702 --> 54:03.672
>> THIS IS NOT
AT ALL WHAT I WAS

54:03.672 --> 54:04.439
EXPECTING.

54:04.439 --> 54:07.376
IT'S GOING TO BE
HARD FOR ME TO

54:07.376 --> 54:11.079
TALK TO GABBY BECAUSE I FEEL

54:11.079 --> 54:11.980
LIKE SHE'S THE CONSOLATION

54:11.980 --> 54:12.214
PRIZE.

54:12.214 --> 54:13.081
I DON'T KNOW IF
THE LOVE OF YOUR

54:13.081 --> 54:15.417
LIFE IS GONE.

54:15.417 --> 54:16.652
I DON'T KNOW.

54:16.652 --> 54:19.354
>> DON'T LOOK AT IT LIKE THE

54:19.354 --> 54:19.788
CONSOLATION PRIZES.

54:19.788 --> 54:20.455
THEY'RE NOT.

54:20.455 --> 54:22.324
AND ONE OF THEM COULD END UP

54:22.324 --> 54:23.525
BEING YOUR FUTURE

54:23.525 --> 54:26.495
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW.

54:26.495 --> 54:27.763
AND SO, GABBY IS
HERE TODAY, AND

54:27.763 --> 54:28.964
I'M EXCITED FOR YOU TO GET TO

54:28.964 --> 54:30.966
KNOW HER.

54:30.966 --> 54:34.603
I KNOW SHE'S WAITING, SO I'M

54:34.603 --> 54:52.521
GOING TO GO GET HER.

54:52.521 --> 54:52.921
>> HI.

54:52.921 --> 54:54.690
>> HEY.

54:54.690 --> 54:56.558
YOU BROUGHT GIFTS?

54:56.558 --> 54:58.060
OKAY.

54:58.060 --> 54:58.593
NOT FOR ME?

54:58.593 --> 55:00.228
NO.

55:00.228 --> 55:03.265
[LAUGHTER]

55:03.265 --> 55:06.335
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

55:06.335 --> 55:07.636
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING?

55:07.636 --> 55:08.737
>> BETTER, FOR SURE.

55:08.737 --> 55:10.739
>> I'M DOING BETTER, TOO.

55:10.739 --> 55:12.774
I WANT YOU TO KNOW AGAIN, I'M

55:12.774 --> 55:14.476
REALLY, REALLY
HAPPY TO HAVE YOU

55:14.476 --> 55:16.478
HERE.

55:16.478 --> 55:16.945
I DO LOVE YOU.

55:16.945 --> 55:18.113
AND SO, THEY'RE GOING TO SEE

55:18.113 --> 55:19.281
THAT I KNOW WHEN
WE WALK IN AND

55:19.281 --> 55:21.016
SIT DOWN.

55:21.016 --> 55:23.752
ARE YOU READY TO MEET THEM?

55:23.752 --> 55:25.387
>> YEAH.

55:25.387 --> 55:25.754
I'M NERVOUS.

55:25.754 --> 55:26.822
>> I'M NERVOUS TO MEET HIS

55:26.822 --> 55:29.891
FAMILY NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S

55:29.891 --> 55:32.327
MEETING FAMILY, BUT, LIKE, I'M

55:32.327 --> 55:33.295
JUST HOPING THAT THEY CAN GIVE

55:33.295 --> 55:33.862
ME THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT

55:33.862 --> 55:35.364
INSTEAD OF BEING LATE, "OH,

55:35.364 --> 55:36.465
GREAT, SHE'LL
MOST WALKED OUT ON

55:36.465 --> 55:37.599
YOU LAST NIGHT.

55:37.599 --> 55:38.200
DO YOU STILL WANT TO BE WITH

55:38.200 --> 55:41.436
HER?"

55:41.436 --> 55:42.037
SO, LIKE, THAT'S WHAT I'M MOST

55:42.037 --> 55:46.641
SCARED OF.

55:46.641 --> 55:47.109
>> HI.

55:47.109 --> 55:47.609
>> THIS IS MY FAMILY.

55:47.609 --> 55:48.443
MY FAMILY, THIS IS GABBY.

55:48.443 --> 55:49.945
>> NICE TO MEET YOU GUYS.

55:49.945 --> 55:51.580
>> HI, GABBY.

55:51.580 --> 55:54.082
OH, BEAUTIFUL!

55:54.082 --> 55:54.816
>> AND THERE SOME WINE AND

55:54.816 --> 55:56.251
SWEETS.

55:56.251 --> 55:58.687
>> OH, THANK YOU.

55:58.687 --> 56:02.958
>> I WANT IT TO
GO REALLY WELL.

56:02.958 --> 56:04.893
I KNOW HOW MUCH
FAMILY MEANS TO

56:04.893 --> 56:07.562
ME.

56:07.562 --> 56:11.066
I KNOW THAT FAMILY MEANS A LOT

56:11.066 --> 56:12.000
TO HIM.

56:12.000 --> 56:12.634
AND I THINK THIS
IS KIND OF THE

56:12.634 --> 56:13.268
LAST CHANCE WE
GET TO REALLY SEE

56:13.268 --> 56:13.635
IF IT CAN WORK.

56:13.635 --> 56:14.236
>> I'M SO GRATEFUL TO BE HERE

56:14.236 --> 56:14.870
WITH YOU GUYS,
THAT I'M ABLE TO

56:14.870 --> 56:15.470
MEET YOU AND THAT YOU TRAVELED

56:15.470 --> 56:16.071
HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD TO BE

56:16.071 --> 56:16.271
HERE.

56:16.271 --> 56:19.141
I WAS SO NERVOUS
LITERALLY JUST

56:19.141 --> 56:19.908
WALKING IN AND SEEING HOW WARM

56:19.908 --> 56:22.177
YOU GUYS ARE, I
IMMEDIATELY FELT

56:22.177 --> 56:23.478
AT HOME.

56:23.478 --> 56:24.446
SO, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

56:24.446 --> 56:26.181
AT SUCH A GOOD FEELING.

56:26.181 --> 56:32.053
>> WELCOME.

56:32.053 --> 56:35.157
>> I'M VERY
THANKFUL TO BE HERE.

56:35.157 --> 56:37.192
GABBY, I FEEL LIKE I'VE WAITED

56:37.192 --> 56:38.760
MY WHOLE LIFE,
OH, I'M GOING TO

56:38.760 --> 56:42.130
GET...

56:42.130 --> 56:43.365
IF YOU'RE THE
ONE, I'LL BE VERY

56:43.365 --> 56:46.601
HAPPY.

56:46.601 --> 56:51.773
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

56:51.773 --> 56:52.340
HE IS A GEM.

56:52.340 --> 56:53.008
SO, HERE'S TO
YOU, HERE'S TO US,

56:53.008 --> 56:55.477
ALL OF US.

56:55.477 --> 56:57.479
>> CHEERS.

56:57.479 --> 57:02.517
>> GABBY SEEMS VERY OUTGOING,

57:02.517 --> 57:07.589
AND I COULD
DEFINITELY SEE, YOU

57:07.589 --> 57:08.190
KNOW, WHY HE WAS ATTRACTED TO

57:08.190 --> 57:08.390
HER.

57:08.390 --> 57:09.057
I LIKE HER.

57:09.057 --> 57:10.358
>> SHOULD WE GO TALK?

57:10.358 --> 57:10.559
>> YEAH.

57:10.559 --> 57:11.059
>> OKAY.

57:11.059 --> 57:11.827
>> BUT WE KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED AND

57:11.827 --> 57:12.294
WHAT CLAYTON TOLD US.

57:12.294 --> 57:14.429
SO I WAS TRY TO KEEP AN OPEN

57:14.429 --> 57:14.629
MIND.

57:14.629 --> 57:16.731
CLAYTON TOLD US,
YOU KNOW, KIND

57:16.731 --> 57:21.169
OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT, A

57:21.169 --> 57:21.803
VERY EMOTIONAL NIGHT.

57:21.803 --> 57:22.404
SO, WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE YOU

57:22.404 --> 57:23.038
CHANGE YOUR MIND AND DECIDE TO

57:23.038 --> 57:25.907
STAY?

57:25.907 --> 57:29.110
>> HONESTLY, IT WAS HARD.

57:29.110 --> 57:30.946
AND HE HAD SAID
SOME THINGS THAT

57:30.946 --> 57:31.346
WERE VERY HURTFUL.

57:31.346 --> 57:32.314
AND I WAS LIKE, IF THIS IS THE

57:32.314 --> 57:33.515
WAY HE THINKS,
THAT I DON'T HAVE

57:33.515 --> 57:35.484
A CHOICE BUT TO LEAVE.

57:35.484 --> 57:37.953
BUT, LIKE, I AM
FALLING IN LOVE

57:37.953 --> 57:39.187
WITH HIM, AND IN
THAT MOMENT, I

57:39.187 --> 57:40.555
WAS LIKE, I DON'T
THINK I COULD

57:40.555 --> 57:42.991
GIVE UP A MAN LIKE HIM LIKE,

57:42.991 --> 57:45.760
WITHOUT SEEING IT THROUGH.

57:45.760 --> 57:50.298
AND I JUST, LIKE,
ALWAYS TRUST,

57:50.298 --> 57:51.666
LIKE, MY INTUITION, AND I'VE

57:51.666 --> 57:53.802
ALWAYS TRUSTED
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

57:53.802 --> 57:55.837
I KNOW HE WOULD BE SUCH A GOOD

57:55.837 --> 57:58.473
PARTNER, SUCH A GOOD FATHER.

57:58.473 --> 57:59.808
THAT LEAVES ME WITH NO DOUBT.

57:59.808 --> 58:01.643
I TOLD HIM I'M
NOT READY TO HAVE

58:01.643 --> 58:05.814
KIDS, LIKE,
TOMORROW, BUT, LIKE,

58:05.814 --> 58:07.182
I THINK WE COULD
USE A COUPLE OF

58:07.182 --> 58:09.050
YEARS TOGETHER,
BUT I JUST NEVER

58:09.050 --> 58:11.820
MET ANYONE AS,
LIKE, GENUINE AND

58:11.820 --> 58:13.288
OPEN HEARTED AS HIM.

58:13.288 --> 58:14.823
AND THEN LIGHT,
MEANING YOU AND

58:14.823 --> 58:16.958
THE FAMILY, IT MAKES SO MUCH

58:16.958 --> 58:21.229
SENSE.

58:21.229 --> 58:22.397
>> THANK YOU.

58:22.397 --> 58:24.533
HE LOOKED VERY HAPPY WITH YOU.

58:24.533 --> 58:26.167
YOU GUYS WERE LAUGHING.

58:26.167 --> 58:29.404
IT LOOKS VERY
NATURAL, AND LIKE,

58:29.404 --> 58:36.278
YOU KNOW, YOU
JUST FIT RIGHT IN.

58:36.278 --> 58:36.878
>> GABBY IS A VERY CARING,

58:36.878 --> 58:38.213
COMPASSIONATE WOMAN.

58:38.213 --> 58:39.314
I THINK MAYBE BECAUSE OF WHAT

58:39.314 --> 58:41.449
THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH, IT WILL

58:41.449 --> 58:43.285
ONLY MAKE THEM STRONGER.

58:43.285 --> 58:44.819
>> YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO GO

58:44.819 --> 58:47.122
THROUGH THOSE UPS AND DOWNS.

58:47.122 --> 58:50.025
IF YOU DIDN'T, YOU DON'T KNOW

58:50.025 --> 58:50.992
HOW TO WORK THROUGH THOSE

58:50.992 --> 58:51.493
STRUGGLES IF YOU'VE EVER

58:51.493 --> 58:56.498
ENCOUNTERED THEM.

58:56.498 --> 58:57.499
>> HOW ARE YOU, GABBY?

58:57.499 --> 59:02.604
>> I'M GOOD.

59:02.604 --> 59:03.171
WELL, I MEAN, ME BEING HERE

59:03.171 --> 59:04.105
RIGHT NOW, I
COULD BE BACK HOME

59:04.105 --> 59:04.706
HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD, BUT

59:04.706 --> 59:06.274
INSTEAD I'M HERE,
AND HAVING AN

59:06.274 --> 59:07.275
AMAZING TIME WITH HIS FAMILY.

59:07.275 --> 59:08.009
>> FOR MY PERSPECTIVE IT SEEMS

59:08.009 --> 59:08.610
LIKE YOU HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF

59:08.610 --> 59:10.111
HUMOR.

59:10.111 --> 59:11.746
YOU SEEM TO LAUGH
AND BRING JOY.

59:11.746 --> 59:13.915
AND, YOU KNOW, I
COULD SEE IT IN

59:13.915 --> 59:15.350
HIS FACE, LIKE,
IT'S DEFINITELY

59:15.350 --> 59:21.590
THERE.

59:21.590 --> 59:25.460
YOU GOT THAT CHALLENGE OF WHAT

59:25.460 --> 59:25.927
TRANSPIRED LAST NIGHT.

59:25.927 --> 59:26.494
AND YOU DID WALK AWAY, AND I

59:26.494 --> 59:26.995
RESPECT THAT, HONESTLY.

59:26.995 --> 59:34.502
SO FOR YOU TO
COME BACK, THAT'S

59:34.502 --> 59:35.070
PRETTY AMAZING.

59:35.070 --> 59:35.804
>> THANK YOU.

59:35.804 --> 59:38.073
>> IT SAYS THAT
YOU'RE THINKING

59:38.073 --> 59:38.707
THAT THERE ARE
OPPORTUNITIES FOR

59:38.707 --> 59:39.107
YOU GUYS TOGETHER.

59:39.107 --> 59:39.341
>> YEAH.

59:39.341 --> 59:39.975
AND KNOWING THAT I WAS COMING

59:39.975 --> 59:40.642
HERE TODAY, I WAS
REALLY SCARED.

59:40.642 --> 59:42.978
I DIDN'T WANT
YOU GUYS TO THINK

59:42.978 --> 59:43.612
THAT I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING LESS

59:43.612 --> 59:46.314
OF CLAYTON, OR
THAT I DON'T WANT

59:46.314 --> 59:51.753
TO BE HERE.

59:51.753 --> 59:52.520
I WANT TO BE HERE SO BAD, AND

59:52.520 --> 59:53.154
TODAY HAS BEEN
SO SPECIAL, AND,

59:53.154 --> 59:54.289
LIKE, BETTER THAN I EVER COULD

59:54.289 --> 59:58.360
HAVE ASKED FOR.

59:58.360 --> 59:59.127
>> IT'S A SHAME
WHAT TRANSPIRED,

59:59.127 --> 59:59.728
BUT MAYBE IT WILL ALL WORK OUT

59:59.728 --> 1:00:00.328
AT SOME POINT AND THAT CAN BE

1:00:00.328 --> 1:00:00.729
THE END.

1:00:00.729 --> 1:00:01.296
IT CAN MAKE YOU STRONGER FOR

1:00:01.296 --> 1:00:01.997
THAT MATTER, I
DON'T EVEN KNOW.

1:00:01.997 --> 1:00:02.831
>> THANK YOU.

1:00:02.831 --> 1:00:03.898
THAT MEANS A LOT.

1:00:03.898 --> 1:00:06.301
>> I LIKE TO GABBY.

1:00:06.301 --> 1:00:08.837
I THINK SHE'S A
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

1:00:08.837 --> 1:00:11.139
SHE HAS A LEVEL HEAD ON HER

1:00:11.139 --> 1:00:12.641
SHOULDERS.

1:00:12.641 --> 1:00:14.743
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE

1:00:14.743 --> 1:00:16.411
COULD GO THROUGH
THE DISCUSSION

1:00:16.411 --> 1:00:20.649
THEY JUST HAD AND THEN SHOW UP

1:00:20.649 --> 1:00:21.750
AND BE ABLE TO LOOK AT

1:00:21.750 --> 1:00:22.183
SOMEBODY'S PARENTS.

1:00:22.183 --> 1:00:23.184
>> IT WAS SO NICE MEETING YOU

1:00:23.184 --> 1:00:24.819
GUYS.

1:00:24.819 --> 1:00:26.354
>> YOU AS WELL.

1:00:26.354 --> 1:00:29.391
VERY NICE MEETING YOU.

1:00:29.391 --> 1:00:32.427
>> THANK YOU.

1:00:32.427 --> 1:00:34.696
HAVE ANOTHER MEMBER OF OUR

1:00:34.696 --> 1:00:35.697
FAMILY, BUT IN
THE END, I WOULD

1:00:35.697 --> 1:00:36.331
LIKE TO SEE MY
SON HAVE HIS OWN

1:00:36.331 --> 1:00:36.765
CLARITY.

1:00:36.765 --> 1:00:37.999
>> I WAS UPSET
LAST NIGHT, BUT,

1:00:37.999 --> 1:00:38.767
LIKE, I'M HERE
FOR A REASON, AND

1:00:38.767 --> 1:00:39.401
I WANT TO BE HERE SO BAD,

1:00:39.401 --> 1:00:40.035
KNOWING THAT I
COULD HAVE MISSED

1:00:40.035 --> 1:00:40.635
OUT ON ALL OF THAT IS, LIKE,

1:00:40.635 --> 1:00:41.069
REALLY DEVASTATING.

1:00:41.069 --> 1:00:41.870
SO I DO THINK
THAT I MADE SUCH A

1:00:41.870 --> 1:00:43.705
GOOD DECISION.

1:00:43.705 --> 1:00:45.240
I THINK WHAT'S GOT ME THIS FAR

1:00:45.240 --> 1:00:47.375
IS, LIKE, MY TRUST IN YOU AND

1:00:47.375 --> 1:00:50.412
US.

1:00:50.412 --> 1:00:51.680
I'M, LIKE, SO GLAD I LISTENED.

1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:53.181
I DO, I HAVE SO
MANY DEEP, DEEP

1:00:53.181 --> 1:00:54.983
FEELINGS FOR YOU.

1:00:54.983 --> 1:01:00.822
I REALLY DO LOVE YOU.

1:01:00.822 --> 1:01:02.023
>> I DO LOVE CLAYTON.

1:01:02.023 --> 1:01:03.658
AND I THINK TODAY HELPS ME

1:01:03.658 --> 1:01:06.795
REALLY COME TO
THAT REALIZATION

1:01:06.795 --> 1:01:09.431
AND MADE ME MORE THAT.

1:01:09.431 --> 1:01:09.964
>> THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

1:01:09.964 --> 1:01:10.365
>> I'LL MISS YOU.

1:01:10.365 --> 1:01:12.133
>> I'LL MISS YOU MORE.

1:01:12.133 --> 1:01:15.270
>> I DID MAKE THE
RIGHT DECISION

1:01:15.270 --> 1:01:16.905
LAST NIGHT AT
THE ROSE CEREMONY

1:01:16.905 --> 1:01:24.779
AND I TRULY STAND BY THAT.

1:01:24.779 --> 1:01:25.547
AND IT MAKES ME REALLY EXCITED

1:01:25.547 --> 1:01:26.648
FOR THE FUTURE.

1:01:26.648 --> 1:01:37.726
I'M READY NOW
MORE THAN EVER TO

1:01:37.726 --> 1:01:37.992
[APPLAUSE]

1:01:37.992 --> 1:01:38.359
>> Jesse: OKAY.

1:01:38.359 --> 1:01:41.362
SO THINGS WITH
GABBY AND CLAYTON

1:01:41.362 --> 1:01:43.465
SEEM TO BE BACK ON TRACK.

1:01:43.465 --> 1:01:46.301
HOW WILL IT GO
WHEN RACHEL MEETS

1:01:46.301 --> 1:01:46.701
CLAYTON'S FAMILY?

1:01:46.701 --> 1:01:49.003
I GOT A SPOILER ALERT FOR YOU.

1:01:49.003 --> 1:01:51.172
THINGS ARE ABOUT
TO TAKE A TURN.

1:01:51.172 --> 1:01:54.442
A VERY UNEXPECTED TURN.

1:01:54.442 --> 1:01:55.043
OH, YEAH.

1:01:55.043 --> 1:01:55.944
AND SPEAKING A FAMILY, YOU MAY

1:01:55.944 --> 1:01:59.280
KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT THIS

1:01:59.280 --> 1:01:59.614
NEXT ONE.

1:01:59.614 --> 1:01:59.981
THE KARDASHIANS.

1:01:59.981 --> 1:02:01.816
THE WOMEN YOU KNOW AND LOVE ON

1:02:01.816 --> 1:02:02.917
THE BRAND-NEW PLATFORM OF THE

1:02:02.917 --> 1:02:04.519
LIVES MAY CHANGE FROM A FAMILY

1:02:04.519 --> 1:02:06.387
IS FOREVER.

1:02:06.387 --> 1:02:08.389
HERE'S THE WORLDWIDE
PREMIERE OF

1:02:08.389 --> 1:02:12.360
A TRAILER FOR
"THE KARDASHIANS"

1:02:12.360 --> 1:02:13.862
AIRING APRIL 14TH ON HULU.

1:02:13.862 --> 1:02:15.130
>> LIFE WITHOUT CAMERAS WAS A

1:02:15.130 --> 1:02:21.369
BIG CHANGE FOR US.

1:02:21.369 --> 1:02:22.637
>> I THINK IT'S TIME TO SEE A

1:02:22.637 --> 1:02:29.310
WHOLE NEW SIDE OF THE FAMILY.

1:02:29.310 --> 1:02:32.147
>> SO HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE

1:02:32.147 --> 1:02:36.251
BACK?

1:02:36.251 --> 1:02:36.885
>> WE'VE HAD SO MUCH TIME OFF,

1:02:36.885 --> 1:02:38.286
WE KIND OF GONE INTO OUR OWN

1:02:38.286 --> 1:02:38.887
WORLDS.

1:02:38.887 --> 1:02:41.089
>> I'M EXCITED FOR THIS NEW

1:02:41.089 --> 1:02:41.322
CHAPTER.

1:02:41.322 --> 1:02:42.157
>> I'VE BEEN IN THIS GAME LONG

1:02:42.157 --> 1:02:43.992
ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT YOU JUST

1:02:43.992 --> 1:02:44.659
HAVE TO BE YOURSELF.

1:02:44.659 --> 1:02:46.294
>> THEY'RE GOING
TO LIKE YOU FOR

1:02:46.294 --> 1:02:48.530
WHO YOU ARE, NOT
WHAT YOU WEAR.

1:02:48.530 --> 1:02:53.635
I'M JUST KIDDING, OBVIOUSLY.

1:02:53.635 --> 1:02:54.636
>> MY PREGNANCY
IS REALLY PUBLIC

1:02:54.636 --> 1:02:55.003
THIS TIME.

1:02:55.003 --> 1:02:58.306
>> I FEEL LIKE
I'M BEING CHASED.

1:02:58.306 --> 1:03:01.709
>> TRISTEN AND I ARE COMPL

1:03:01.709 --> 1:03:02.076
COMPLICATED.

1:03:02.076 --> 1:03:02.710
>> TRUST TAKES TIME.

1:03:02.710 --> 1:03:06.281
>> TRAVIS AND I WANT TO HAVE A

1:03:06.281 --> 1:03:06.881
BABY.

1:03:06.881 --> 1:03:08.483
>> WILL TAKE OUR
MICS OFF SO YOU

1:03:08.483 --> 1:03:15.890
DON'T GET THE AUDIO.

1:03:15.890 --> 1:03:17.625
>> THIS IS A
RELATIONSHIP THAT I

1:03:17.625 --> 1:03:21.129
DON'T THINK
ANYBODY SAW COMING.

1:03:21.129 --> 1:03:23.431
>> WHO ARE YOU TEXTING, KIM?

1:03:23.431 --> 1:03:25.033
THAT'S HIS NAME
RHYME WITH FEET?

1:03:25.033 --> 1:03:27.235
>> IT'S SO EASY TO COMMENT ON

1:03:27.235 --> 1:03:28.570
PEOPLE WITH NO
IDEA WHAT THEY'RE

1:03:28.570 --> 1:03:30.872
ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH.

1:03:30.872 --> 1:03:33.575
>> IT IS REALLY
HARD WITH KANYE.

1:03:33.575 --> 1:03:36.244
HE TOLD ME MY CAREER WAS OVER.

1:03:36.244 --> 1:03:39.180
>> WHY ARE WE ALWAYS MAKING

1:03:39.180 --> 1:03:39.881
EXCUSES FOR THE PEOPLE THAT

1:03:39.881 --> 1:03:40.215
TRAUMATIZE US?

1:03:40.215 --> 1:03:42.984
>> THIS IS SO RIDICULOUS.

1:03:42.984 --> 1:03:45.286
>> WE HAVE ALL
THE TIME AND ALL

1:03:45.286 --> 1:03:46.321
OF THE RESOURCES TO BURN THEM

1:03:46.321 --> 1:03:47.288
ALL TO THE [BLEEP] GROUND.

1:03:47.288 --> 1:03:49.791
>> NEVER GO
AGAINST THE FAMILY.

1:03:49.791 --> 1:04:02.036
>> NEVER GO
AGAINST THE FAMILY.

1:04:16.552 --> 1:04:22.828
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

1:04:22.828 --> 1:04:24.763
>> Jesse: WELCOME BACK.

1:04:24.763 --> 1:04:26.265
WE ARE LIVE HERE
IN LOS ANGELES

1:04:26.265 --> 1:04:28.067
FOR WHAT IS ONLY THE BEGINNING

1:04:28.067 --> 1:04:30.669
OF A TOTALLY INSANE TONIGHT

1:04:30.669 --> 1:04:31.070
"BACHELOR" FINALE.

1:04:31.070 --> 1:04:32.971
WHAT CLAYTON'S FAMILY HELP HIM

1:04:32.971 --> 1:04:35.641
DECIDE WHICH WOMAN IS THE BEST

1:04:35.641 --> 1:04:36.108
FIT FOR HIM?

1:04:36.108 --> 1:04:37.609
IF IT WERE ONLY THAT SIMPLE.

1:04:37.609 --> 1:04:39.778
IT NOW IS A GOOD
TIME TO TAKE A

1:04:39.778 --> 1:04:41.847
SEAT, GRAB YOUR
WINE GLASS, AND

1:04:41.847 --> 1:04:42.548
SQUEEZED IT TIGHT.

1:04:42.548 --> 1:04:54.593
BECAUSE IT IS
ABOUT TO GET REAL.

1:04:54.593 --> 1:04:56.795
>> GOING IN TO TODAY, I HAVE A

1:04:56.795 --> 1:05:00.032
LOT OF DIFFERENT EMOTIONS.

1:05:00.032 --> 1:05:05.871
I AM REALLY EXCITED TO MEET

1:05:05.871 --> 1:05:07.539
CLAYTON'S FAMILY.

1:05:07.539 --> 1:05:08.173
IT'S JUST, MY
EMOTIONS ARE STILL

1:05:08.173 --> 1:05:12.578
REALLY HEAVY FROM THE ROSE

1:05:12.578 --> 1:05:17.549
CEREMONY.

1:05:17.549 --> 1:05:22.287
SO, I'M EXCITED TO MEET THEM,

1:05:22.287 --> 1:05:23.755
BUT I'M ALSO STILL FEELING

1:05:23.755 --> 1:05:24.456
REALLY HURTS FROM THE ROSE

1:05:24.456 --> 1:05:24.723
CEREMONY.

1:05:24.723 --> 1:05:25.357
LAST TIME I SAW
CLAYTON, HE WAS

1:05:25.357 --> 1:05:25.958
REALLY EMOTIONALLY DISTRAUGHT

1:05:25.958 --> 1:05:27.426
OVER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

1:05:27.426 --> 1:05:28.927
>> HELLO.

1:05:28.927 --> 1:05:31.063
>> RACHEL.

1:05:31.063 --> 1:05:32.731
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU STILL

1:05:32.731 --> 1:05:35.434
BROKEN HEARTED.

1:05:35.434 --> 1:05:38.837
IF YOU STILL HAVING TROUBLE

1:05:38.837 --> 1:05:40.305
MOVING FORWARD IN THIS.

1:05:40.305 --> 1:05:40.939
I MEAN, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

1:05:40.939 --> 1:05:41.573
I'VE SEEN HIM
SINCE HE BROKE MY

1:05:41.573 --> 1:05:41.773
HEART.

1:05:41.773 --> 1:05:42.007
>> HEY.

1:05:42.007 --> 1:05:42.474
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING?

1:05:42.474 --> 1:05:42.708
>> GOOD.

1:05:42.708 --> 1:05:43.909
I LIKE YOUR SWEATER.

1:05:43.909 --> 1:05:44.810
>> THANK YOU.

1:05:44.810 --> 1:05:46.145
>> YOU LOOK HAPPY.

1:05:46.145 --> 1:05:49.648
>> I AM HAPPY.

1:05:49.648 --> 1:05:50.415
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

1:05:50.415 --> 1:05:51.817
>> I'M GOOD.

1:05:51.817 --> 1:05:52.384
>> YOU ALL RIGHT?

1:05:52.384 --> 1:05:52.951
>> YET.

1:05:52.951 --> 1:05:53.185
>> OKAY.

1:05:53.185 --> 1:05:53.986
I JUST WANT TO CHECK IN WITH

1:05:53.986 --> 1:05:54.653
YOU, OBVIOUSLY,
AFTER LAST TIME

1:05:54.653 --> 1:05:54.953
I SAW YOU.

1:05:54.953 --> 1:05:55.621
I'M STILL VERY
THANKFUL THAT YOU

1:05:55.621 --> 1:05:56.121
STUCK THIS OUT WITH ME.

1:05:56.121 --> 1:05:57.289
FOR YOU TO TRUST ME AND TAKE

1:05:57.289 --> 1:05:58.257
ANOTHER STEP FORWARD MEAN SO

1:05:58.257 --> 1:05:59.191
MUCH.

1:05:59.191 --> 1:06:00.692
AND, LIKE, THIS IS SUCH A BIG

1:06:00.692 --> 1:06:03.762
STEP, TO MEET MY FAMILY.

1:06:03.762 --> 1:06:06.231
>> I'M EXCITED TO MEET RACHEL.

1:06:06.231 --> 1:06:08.000
>> I SAW ATTRACTION YESTERDAY

1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:09.368
BETWEEN HE HIM AND GABBY.

1:06:09.368 --> 1:06:12.237
BUT WHO'S TO SAY THAT WHEN

1:06:12.237 --> 1:06:14.773
RACHEL COMES IN THE DOOR THAT

1:06:14.773 --> 1:06:15.340
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING THAT

1:06:15.340 --> 1:06:16.575
GLOWS OFF OF HER?

1:06:16.575 --> 1:06:18.544
>> CLAYTON AND
HER HAT HEADED UP

1:06:18.544 --> 1:06:20.379
FROM THE START,
IT SOUNDS LIKE,

1:06:20.379 --> 1:06:21.246
AND SHE'S BEEN
ALL IN SINCE DAY

1:06:21.246 --> 1:06:21.747
ONE.

1:06:21.747 --> 1:06:22.814
I HOPE THAT WE CAN SENSE OR

1:06:22.814 --> 1:06:24.516
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S CAUSING THE

1:06:24.516 --> 1:06:26.785
TURMOIL IN HIS MIND OVER TWO

1:06:26.785 --> 1:06:29.354
DIFFERENT WOMEN.

1:06:29.354 --> 1:06:32.658
GABBY, YESTERDAY, IT'S A

1:06:32.658 --> 1:06:35.093
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

1:06:35.093 --> 1:06:38.163
LIKE HER.

1:06:38.163 --> 1:06:38.730
I'M SURE WOULD LIKE RACHEL.

1:06:38.730 --> 1:06:39.798
I'M ACTUALLY
FEELING PRETTY GOOD

1:06:39.798 --> 1:06:40.499
ABOUT IT.

1:06:40.499 --> 1:06:40.966
>> HELLO.

1:06:40.966 --> 1:06:42.034
>> WELCOME.

1:06:42.034 --> 1:06:43.735
>> NICE TO MEET YOU GUYS.

1:06:43.735 --> 1:06:45.237
I'M RACHEL.

1:06:45.237 --> 1:06:47.539
SO NICE TO ME.

1:06:47.539 --> 1:06:50.776
>> HI, RACHEL.

1:06:50.776 --> 1:06:51.410
>> YESTERDAY WAS
A LOT OF SHOCK

1:06:51.410 --> 1:06:52.177
AND AWE.

1:06:52.177 --> 1:06:52.644
>> THESE ARE FOR YOU.

1:06:52.644 --> 1:06:52.978
>> THANK YOU.

1:06:52.978 --> 1:06:54.146
>> CLAYTON, IT'S LIKE HE'S

1:06:54.146 --> 1:06:57.082
LOOKING FOR THAT HELP FROM US,

1:06:57.082 --> 1:06:58.250
AND I THINK WERE READY TO HELP

1:06:58.250 --> 1:06:59.484
THEM THROUGH THAT.

1:06:59.484 --> 1:07:02.120
>> I'M REALLY HAPPY TO FINALLY

1:07:02.120 --> 1:07:02.955
MEET YOU GUYS,
AND THIS PLACE IS

1:07:02.955 --> 1:07:04.022
SO BEAUTIFUL.

1:07:04.022 --> 1:07:06.091
>> MY PARENTS FOUND IT ON

1:07:06.091 --> 1:07:07.593
AIRBNB.

1:07:07.593 --> 1:07:09.328
>> NO WAY!

1:07:09.328 --> 1:07:11.496
>> IT'S A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OUT

1:07:11.496 --> 1:07:13.365
THERE.

1:07:13.365 --> 1:07:15.200
>> ICELAND IS BEAUTIFUL.

1:07:15.200 --> 1:07:15.867
>> I'VE NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE

1:07:15.867 --> 1:07:16.868
THIS, SO IT'S DEFINITELY A LOT

1:07:16.868 --> 1:07:18.570
DIFFERENT.

1:07:18.570 --> 1:07:20.505
>> SO, I DO HAVE A QUESTION.

1:07:20.505 --> 1:07:21.139
SO, I WAS JUST CURIOUS, LIKE,

1:07:21.139 --> 1:07:23.408
WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION, WHEN

1:07:23.408 --> 1:07:24.676
YOU GOT OUT OF THE LIMO?

1:07:24.676 --> 1:07:27.679
>> I WAS REALLY NERVOUS.

1:07:27.679 --> 1:07:28.313
BUT I WAS SO
EXCITED TO SEE HIM

1:07:28.313 --> 1:07:28.947
AND FINALLY BE IN FRONT OF HIM

1:07:28.947 --> 1:07:30.148
AFTER JUST SEEING A COUPLE OF

1:07:30.148 --> 1:07:31.316
PICTURES ONLINE.

1:07:31.316 --> 1:07:32.551
BUT REMEMBER JUST BEING LIKE,

1:07:32.551 --> 1:07:33.151
"OH, MY GOSH, YOU'RE SO TALL."

1:07:33.151 --> 1:07:34.653
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING.

1:07:34.653 --> 1:07:35.087
AND THEN YOUR EYES.

1:07:35.087 --> 1:07:36.088
>> THAT'S A FIRST IMPRESSION.

1:07:36.088 --> 1:07:37.022
ALWAYS TALL.

1:07:37.022 --> 1:07:39.625
I'VE GOT THAT GOING FOR ME.

1:07:39.625 --> 1:07:45.964
ALWAYS TALL.

1:07:45.964 --> 1:07:46.632
>> CLAYTON SAID THAT RACHEL IS

1:07:46.632 --> 1:07:48.400
TOTALLY DIFFERENT
FROM GABBY, SO

1:07:48.400 --> 1:07:49.201
I'M CURIOUS TO SEE HOW SHE IS

1:07:49.201 --> 1:07:50.802
DIFFERENT.

1:07:50.802 --> 1:07:51.436
>> RACHEL, YOU
WANT TO GO TALK?

1:07:51.436 --> 1:07:53.272
>> YES.

1:07:53.272 --> 1:07:54.806
>> I FEEL LIKE,
YOU KNOW, AFTER

1:07:54.806 --> 1:07:56.308
HIM ASSURING THE TURMOIL THAT

1:07:56.308 --> 1:07:56.908
HE'S BEEN GOING THROUGH, THAT

1:07:56.908 --> 1:07:58.610
TODAY WILL BE
MORE ENLIGHTENING

1:07:58.610 --> 1:08:00.479
FOR US TO HELP HIM IN HIS

1:08:00.479 --> 1:08:03.615
DECISION, OR MAYBE GET MORE

1:08:03.615 --> 1:08:04.283
CLARITY.

1:08:04.283 --> 1:08:06.118
>> I WAS NOT EXPECTING WHAT

1:08:06.118 --> 1:08:07.653
HAPPENED AT THE ROSE CEREMONY.

1:08:07.653 --> 1:08:08.820
AND IT WAS REALLY TOUGH.

1:08:08.820 --> 1:08:10.722
BECAUSE IT IS HEARTBREAK.

1:08:10.722 --> 1:08:14.259
IN A WAY, IT'S HEARTBREAK, BUT

1:08:14.259 --> 1:08:14.760
YOU'RE STILL SO IN LOVE.

1:08:14.760 --> 1:08:16.028
AND IT'S JUST SO HARD TO THINK

1:08:16.028 --> 1:08:17.696
ABOUT THE FACT
THAT I CAN BE SO

1:08:17.696 --> 1:08:20.599
IN LOVE AND HE
CAN BE SO IN LOVE

1:08:20.599 --> 1:08:22.167
WITH TWO, THREE PEOPLE.

1:08:22.167 --> 1:08:25.470
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO UNDERSTAND.

1:08:25.470 --> 1:08:27.873
AT THE ROSE CEREMONY, I WAS

1:08:27.873 --> 1:08:30.008
LIKE, "IF I LEAVE TODAY, LIKE,

1:08:30.008 --> 1:08:32.978
I'LL SPEND THE
REST OF MY LIFE,

1:08:32.978 --> 1:08:37.516
LIKE, WONDERING
WHAT THIS COULD

1:08:37.516 --> 1:08:39.017
HAVE BEEN, BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT

1:08:39.017 --> 1:08:40.385
IT IS."

1:08:40.385 --> 1:08:44.022
I THINK HE DESERVES AND OUR

1:08:44.022 --> 1:08:44.690
RELATIONSHIP
DESERVES FOR ME TO

1:08:44.690 --> 1:08:47.326
GIVE IT MY ALL.

1:08:47.326 --> 1:08:49.494
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1:08:49.494 --> 1:08:51.463
>> AND I JUST REALLY FEEL LIKE

1:08:51.463 --> 1:08:56.268
HE IS PERFECT FOR ME.

1:08:56.268 --> 1:08:56.868
YOU KNOW, I REALLY, REALLY DO

1:08:56.868 --> 1:08:59.137
HOPE IT'S HIM AND I AT THE END

1:08:59.137 --> 1:09:00.706
BECAUSE I DO, I SEE HIM AS MY

1:09:00.706 --> 1:09:02.441
HUSBAND.

1:09:02.441 --> 1:09:03.408
>> SO IF HE WERE
TO PROPOSE, YOU

1:09:03.408 --> 1:09:04.042
WOULD BE WILLING
TO ACCEPT IT, I

1:09:04.042 --> 1:09:04.476
GUESS, HIS PROPOSAL?

1:09:04.476 --> 1:09:05.077
>> YEAH, I SEE IT, AND THAT'S

1:09:05.077 --> 1:09:06.778
THE PART THAT SAYS SCARY.

1:09:06.778 --> 1:09:08.513
>> BEFORE WE EVEN
MET, YOU KNOW,

1:09:08.513 --> 1:09:11.983
AND HEARD THE STORY, I JUST

1:09:11.983 --> 1:09:12.651
THOUGHT, WOW,
THAT REALLY SPEAKS

1:09:12.651 --> 1:09:14.986
VOLUMES ABOUT YOU, THAT YOU

1:09:14.986 --> 1:09:17.856
DIDN'T DECIDE TO LEAVE, WHICH

1:09:17.856 --> 1:09:18.290
YOU COULD HAVE.

1:09:18.290 --> 1:09:20.492
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN

1:09:20.492 --> 1:09:21.593
UNDERSTANDABLE AND RESPECTFUL.

1:09:21.593 --> 1:09:24.429
BUT THE FACT THAT
YOU WANTED TO

1:09:24.429 --> 1:09:26.965
STAY, YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT SPOKE

1:09:26.965 --> 1:09:28.233
VOLUMES ABOUT YOU AS A PERSON.

1:09:28.233 --> 1:09:32.971
>> RACHEL KIND
OF SURPRISED ME.

1:09:32.971 --> 1:09:34.339
I COULD SEE THE
CONFIDENCE THAT

1:09:34.339 --> 1:09:36.608
SHE FEELS IN
THEIR RELATIONSHIP

1:09:36.608 --> 1:09:39.978
AND THEIR CONNECTION.

1:09:39.978 --> 1:09:40.679
MAYBE SHE COULD BE THE ONE

1:09:40.679 --> 1:09:41.279
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T GOING TO

1:09:41.279 --> 1:09:42.547
LEAVE, AND IF SHE SEES IT LIKE

1:09:42.547 --> 1:09:44.282
THAT, THEN SHE OBVIOUSLY MUST

1:09:44.282 --> 1:09:46.051
SEE A FUTURE WITH
HIM AND MAYBE

1:09:46.051 --> 1:09:48.153
SEES THEIR RELATIONSHIP

1:09:48.153 --> 1:09:49.521
DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS.

1:09:49.521 --> 1:09:52.758
>> SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1:09:52.758 --> 1:09:57.062
WOULD HE THINK
ABOUT THIS WHOLE

1:09:57.062 --> 1:09:58.563
ENVIRONMENT AND EVERYTHING

1:09:58.563 --> 1:10:00.132
THAT'S GOING ON?

1:10:00.132 --> 1:10:03.335
>> THIS WHOLE
PROCESS WAS CRAZY.

1:10:03.335 --> 1:10:05.871
BUT WE HAD A
CONNECTION SO EARLY

1:10:05.871 --> 1:10:08.507
ON.

1:10:08.507 --> 1:10:09.040
I'M SHOCKED AT, LIKE, HOW

1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:11.943
STRONGLY I FEEL, AND THAT SO

1:10:11.943 --> 1:10:14.379
GENUINE.

1:10:14.379 --> 1:10:16.181
HE'S ALWAYS LISTEN TO ME AND

1:10:16.181 --> 1:10:18.383
TRULY SEE ME I FEEL LIKE MORE

1:10:18.383 --> 1:10:20.051
THAN ANYONE EVER HAS.

1:10:20.051 --> 1:10:21.586
AND WHEN I TOLD HIM I WAS IN

1:10:21.586 --> 1:10:24.156
LOVE WITH HIM
AND HE TOLD ME HE

1:10:24.156 --> 1:10:25.724
WAS IN LOVE WITH
ME, IT JUST WAS

1:10:25.724 --> 1:10:28.960
A FEELING I HAVEN'T EVER HAD

1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:29.428
BEFORE.

1:10:29.428 --> 1:10:30.328
I'M NEVER BEEN
IN LOVE THE WAY I

1:10:30.328 --> 1:10:31.229
AM WITH HIM.

1:10:31.229 --> 1:10:32.898
AND AS DIFFICULT
AND AS HARD AS

1:10:32.898 --> 1:10:34.633
THIS HAS BEEN FOR ME, AND IT

1:10:34.633 --> 1:10:36.802
STILL IS, HONESTLY,
I FEEL LIKE

1:10:36.802 --> 1:10:38.403
I'VE ALSO BEEN
ABLE TO BE REALLY

1:10:38.403 --> 1:10:39.638
OPEN AND VULNERABLE WITH HIM,

1:10:39.638 --> 1:10:41.106
AND HE'S GIVEN ME EVERY REASON

1:10:41.106 --> 1:10:41.840
TO CONTINUE TO
DO THAT AND TRUST

1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:44.443
HIM.

1:10:44.443 --> 1:10:46.411
>> DO YOU TRUST HIM?

1:10:46.411 --> 1:10:48.213
>> I DO TRUST HIM.

1:10:48.213 --> 1:10:51.750
>> IT'S TOUGH.

1:10:51.750 --> 1:10:55.320
>> YEAH.

1:10:55.320 --> 1:10:56.121
>> I WOULD'VE SMACKED HIM.

1:10:56.121 --> 1:10:56.488
[LAUGHTER]

1:10:56.488 --> 1:10:57.456
>> I WAS VERY EMOTIONAL.

1:10:57.456 --> 1:10:59.090
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO LIGHT, WRAP

1:10:59.090 --> 1:11:00.459
MY MIND COMPLETELY AROUND IT.

1:11:00.459 --> 1:11:05.130
BUT I AM HOPEFUL.

1:11:05.130 --> 1:11:07.232
AND I DO FEEL REALLY GOOD, BUT

1:11:07.232 --> 1:11:10.735
IT IS A LOT, EMOTIONALLY.

1:11:10.735 --> 1:11:11.369
BUT I REALLY AM
SO IN LOVE WITH

1:11:11.369 --> 1:11:11.570
HIM.

1:11:11.570 --> 1:11:13.605
I AM.

1:11:13.605 --> 1:11:15.106
AND I COULD SIT
HERE AND I COULD

1:11:15.106 --> 1:11:15.674
TALK ABOUT IT ALL DAY, BUT,

1:11:15.674 --> 1:11:16.274
YEAH, THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I'M

1:11:16.274 --> 1:11:17.943
AT.

1:11:17.943 --> 1:11:20.011
>> IT'S NICE TO HEAR THAT.

1:11:20.011 --> 1:11:21.546
I MEAN, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

1:11:21.546 --> 1:11:24.549
SEEING WHERE YOUR
GUYS' JOURNEY

1:11:24.549 --> 1:11:28.653
ENDS.

1:11:28.653 --> 1:11:31.256
>> ME TO.

1:11:31.256 --> 1:11:32.424
>> IT WAS A PLEASURE MEETING

1:11:32.424 --> 1:11:32.591
YOU.

1:11:32.591 --> 1:11:33.191
>> A PLEASURE MEETING YOU.

1:11:33.191 --> 1:11:34.559
>> TODAY WENT AMAZING.

1:11:34.559 --> 1:11:36.795
I REALLY DO SEE MYSELF FITTING

1:11:36.795 --> 1:11:40.699
IN WITH CLAYTON'S FAMILY.

1:11:40.699 --> 1:11:44.469
I SEE THEM WELCOMING ME WITH

1:11:44.469 --> 1:11:49.040
OPEN ARMS.

1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:52.644
I DO SEE THE
ENGAGEMENT AND WANT

1:11:52.644 --> 1:11:57.549
TO BE, LIKE, MARRIED TO HIM.

1:11:57.549 --> 1:11:59.618
I WANT THIS TO
WORK, AND THAT'S

1:11:59.618 --> 1:12:00.685
WHY I'M STILL HERE.

1:12:00.685 --> 1:12:01.319
>> I HAD SUCH AN AMAZING DAY.

1:12:01.319 --> 1:12:01.820
AND I AM REALLY, REALLY

1:12:01.820 --> 1:12:02.821
GRATEFUL.

1:12:02.821 --> 1:12:03.522
>> I APPRECIATE
ALL THAT YOU'VE

1:12:03.522 --> 1:12:05.190
DONE TODAY.

1:12:05.190 --> 1:12:06.458
IT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.

1:12:06.458 --> 1:12:08.727
>> I AM IN LOVE WITH HIM.

1:12:08.727 --> 1:12:13.331
LIKE, I WANT TO SEE THIS

1:12:13.331 --> 1:12:15.934
THROUGH.

1:12:15.934 --> 1:12:19.237
BUT IT SO HARD,
BECAUSE I DON'T

1:12:19.237 --> 1:12:21.306
KNOW WHERE HIS HEAD'S AT.

1:12:21.306 --> 1:12:22.841
I NOTE THAT HE'S IN LOVE WITH

1:12:22.841 --> 1:12:24.943
GABBY.

1:12:24.943 --> 1:12:25.744
BUT I REALLY WANT IT TO BE ME

1:12:25.744 --> 1:12:26.444
AND HIM AT THE END.

1:12:26.444 --> 1:12:27.078
>> HIM NOW THAT
YOU'VE MET BOTH

1:12:27.078 --> 1:12:27.712
WOMEN, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

1:12:27.712 --> 1:12:28.280
>> YOU KNOW, BOTH WOMEN ARE

1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:28.947
MARVELOUS.

1:12:28.947 --> 1:12:30.181
WITH ONE OF THEM.

1:12:30.181 --> 1:12:30.782
BUT I THINK YOU CAN FIGURE OUT

1:12:30.782 --> 1:12:31.416
FROM THERE IF ONE REALLY DOES

1:12:31.416 --> 1:12:31.683
STAND OUT.

1:12:31.683 --> 1:12:32.217
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GET IT

1:12:32.217 --> 1:12:32.517
INTERNALLY.

1:12:32.517 --> 1:12:33.552
IF YOU DON'T FEEL IT INSIDE,

1:12:33.552 --> 1:12:34.219
THEN IT AIN'T RIGHT.

1:12:34.219 --> 1:12:36.454
>> THIS LAST
WEEK, MY HEART HAS

1:12:36.454 --> 1:12:38.056
STARTED TO YELL LOUDER AND

1:12:38.056 --> 1:12:39.858
LOUDER AND LOUDER.

1:12:39.858 --> 1:12:41.359
NOW I HAVE THIS
FIGHT, WHERE MY

1:12:41.359 --> 1:12:44.529
MIND IS TELLING ME TO KEEP IT

1:12:44.529 --> 1:12:46.531
OPEN, THERE STILL
MULTIPLE WOMEN

1:12:46.531 --> 1:12:47.332
HERE, LIKE, YOU SHOULD STILL

1:12:47.332 --> 1:12:48.033
KEEP AN OPEN MIND, BUT I CAN'T

1:12:48.033 --> 1:12:48.600
SHUT DOWN WHAT MY HEART IS

1:12:48.600 --> 1:12:48.900
TELLING ME.

1:12:48.900 --> 1:12:49.568
>> NO MATTER WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN

1:12:49.568 --> 1:12:51.002
DOWN THIS ROAD,
YOU'RE GOING TO

1:12:51.002 --> 1:12:51.336
HURT SOMEBODY.

1:12:51.336 --> 1:12:52.804
SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

1:12:52.804 --> 1:12:55.407
ACCEPT THAT FACT.

1:12:55.407 --> 1:12:56.841
>> I'M LOST RIGHT NOW.

1:12:56.841 --> 1:12:59.911
HE'S SERIOUS WITH
GABBY RACHEL,

1:12:59.911 --> 1:13:00.779
MY MIND IF I HAD
TO TODAY AS FAR

1:13:00.779 --> 1:13:02.847
AS WHICH OF THE
TWO I WOULD MOVE

1:13:02.847 --> 1:13:08.620
FORWARD WITH.

1:13:08.620 --> 1:13:09.921
I LOVE BOTH GABBY AND RACHEL.

1:13:09.921 --> 1:13:10.522
BUT WHEN SUSIE LEFT, MY WHOLE

1:13:10.522 --> 1:13:10.989
LIFE JUST GOT FLIPPED

1:13:10.989 --> 1:13:12.290
UPSIDE DOWN.

1:13:12.290 --> 1:13:13.592
HOW MY SUPPOSED
TO JUST LET THAT

1:13:13.592 --> 1:13:16.628
GO?

1:13:16.628 --> 1:13:18.563
I'M QUESTIONING EVERYTHING.

1:13:18.563 --> 1:13:22.100
I REALIZE THAT, LIKE, THROUGH

1:13:22.100 --> 1:13:23.168
MEETING MY FAMILY, IT DIDN'T

1:13:23.168 --> 1:13:26.171
STOP ME FROM THINKING ABOUT

1:13:26.171 --> 1:13:27.305
SUSIE.

1:13:36.106 --> 1:13:41.577
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

1:13:41.577 --> 1:13:43.745
>> Jesse: WELCOME BACK TO OUR

1:13:43.745 --> 1:13:47.249
LIVE FINALE.

1:13:47.249 --> 1:13:49.084
THINGS SEEM TWO
TO GO WELL WITH

1:13:49.084 --> 1:13:51.086
BOTH WOMEN.

1:13:51.086 --> 1:13:54.356
BUT, CLAYTON AND IT CAN'T STOP

1:13:54.356 --> 1:13:54.990
SUSIE.

1:13:54.990 --> 1:13:56.758
I TOLD YOU THINGS ARE GOING TO

1:13:56.758 --> 1:13:57.059
GET CRAZIER.

1:13:57.059 --> 1:14:13.575
HERE WE GO.

1:14:13.575 --> 1:14:14.409
>> YOU GUYS ALL KIND OF FEEL

1:14:14.409 --> 1:14:15.010
THAT HE PROBABLY HAS SOMEBODY

1:14:15.010 --> 1:14:15.644
THERE, IF HE OPENS
HIS HEART AND

1:14:15.644 --> 1:14:16.178
HIS MIND AND REALIZES IT.

1:14:16.178 --> 1:14:16.745
I THINK EVERYBODY APPROVES,

1:14:16.745 --> 1:14:16.945
RIGHT?

1:14:16.945 --> 1:14:18.046
>> I APPROVE OF
EITHER OF THEM.

1:14:18.046 --> 1:14:18.914
>> DID YOU THINK ONE WAS

1:14:18.914 --> 1:14:20.249
DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER?

1:14:20.249 --> 1:14:21.750
>> HE'S NOT IN
LOVE WITH BOTH OF

1:14:21.750 --> 1:14:23.085
THEM EQUALLY.

1:14:23.085 --> 1:14:23.452
THERE'S NO WAY.

1:14:23.452 --> 1:14:24.186
>> TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT HIS

1:14:24.186 --> 1:14:25.220
PROBLEMS ARE.

1:14:25.220 --> 1:14:26.488
>> I GOT A LOT.

1:14:26.488 --> 1:14:30.392
[LAUGHTER]

1:14:30.392 --> 1:14:32.895
>> I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU HAVE ANY

1:14:32.895 --> 1:14:35.164
PROBLEMS.

1:14:35.164 --> 1:14:35.664
WHAT ARE YOUR PROBLEMS?

1:14:35.664 --> 1:14:36.732
>> I WOULDN'T SAY PROBLEMS.

1:14:36.732 --> 1:14:37.332
I THINK IT'S JUST A MATTER OF,

1:14:37.332 --> 1:14:41.170
LIKE, BEING CONFLICTED.

1:14:41.170 --> 1:14:45.073
>> WHY?

1:14:45.073 --> 1:14:45.807
WHAT'S CONFLICTING?

1:14:45.807 --> 1:14:48.110
>> THE HARD PART
IS, LIKE, BEING

1:14:48.110 --> 1:14:49.945
OUT THERE AND
BEING WITH RACHEL

1:14:49.945 --> 1:14:54.683
IN THE MOMENT IT'S LIKE I SEE

1:14:54.683 --> 1:14:57.586
HER, I SEE A FUTURE.

1:14:57.586 --> 1:14:58.320
LIKE AGAIN, I DO SEE IT.

1:14:58.320 --> 1:14:58.954
I SEE THE LOVE
THERE AND I FEEL

1:14:58.954 --> 1:15:02.357
IT.

1:15:02.357 --> 1:15:08.797
YOU GUYS SEE IT.

1:15:08.797 --> 1:15:09.364
BUT I THOUGHT THE SAME THING

1:15:09.364 --> 1:15:09.898
WITH GABBY, LIKE, AS I WAS

1:15:09.898 --> 1:15:10.265
STANDING THERE.

1:15:10.265 --> 1:15:10.933
AND THROUGH THE
CLARITY THAT YOU

1:15:10.933 --> 1:15:11.533
ALL PROVIDED ME THE LAST FEW

1:15:11.533 --> 1:15:12.167
DAYS, AND JUST TELLING ME THAT

1:15:12.167 --> 1:15:14.469
YOU'LL BE SUPPORTIVE OF ME NO

1:15:14.469 --> 1:15:15.938
MATTER WHAT, AND
YOU WANT ME TO

1:15:15.938 --> 1:15:19.541
FOLLOW MY HEART,
THAT'S WHEN IT

1:15:19.541 --> 1:15:20.609
HIT ME.

1:15:20.609 --> 1:15:21.243
I'M JUST REALIZING
MY HEART AND

1:15:21.243 --> 1:15:21.577
WHERE IT'S AT.

1:15:21.577 --> 1:15:23.045
MY HEART IS HERE WITH THESE

1:15:23.045 --> 1:15:28.550
WOMEN AND NOW MY HEART IS OUT

1:15:28.550 --> 1:15:29.151
BEYOND THESE WALLS WITH SUSIE.

1:15:29.151 --> 1:15:30.552
>> WHY IS THAT?

1:15:30.552 --> 1:15:32.821
>> WHAT I HAD WITH SUSIE WAS

1:15:32.821 --> 1:15:35.224
VERY, VERY SPECIAL.

1:15:35.224 --> 1:15:35.857
THAT'S NOT TO DISCREDIT WHAT I

1:15:35.857 --> 1:15:36.892
HAVE WITH RACHEL
OR WHAT I HAVE

1:15:36.892 --> 1:15:38.527
WITH GABBY.

1:15:38.527 --> 1:15:40.829
I MEAN, YOU GUYS
CAN CLEARLY SEE

1:15:40.829 --> 1:15:41.430
THAT IT'S SO SPECIAL, WHAT I

1:15:41.430 --> 1:15:44.099
HAVE WITH THOSE WOMEN.

1:15:44.099 --> 1:15:45.367
BUT IT JUST WAS A LITTLE BIT

1:15:45.367 --> 1:15:46.902
MORE SPECIAL WITH SUSIE.

1:15:46.902 --> 1:15:48.937
>> SHE DIDN'T THINK SO.

1:15:48.937 --> 1:15:51.340
>> BUT SHE, I
MEAN, CLAYTON, SHE

1:15:51.340 --> 1:15:52.741
LEFT YOU.

1:15:52.741 --> 1:15:55.544
>> IT'S NOT THAT

1:15:55.544 --> 1:15:57.913
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

1:15:57.913 --> 1:16:00.315
>> IT IS.

1:16:00.315 --> 1:16:00.816
>> IT'S NOT.

1:16:00.816 --> 1:16:01.183
> IT IS.

1:16:01.183 --> 1:16:01.750
>> YOU WEREN'T THERE FOR IT.

1:16:01.750 --> 1:16:02.150
>> DOESN'T MATTER.

1:16:02.150 --> 1:16:03.018
>> I THINK THE
MOMENT BECAME TOO

1:16:03.018 --> 1:16:04.886
BIG FOR THE BOTH OF US.

1:16:04.886 --> 1:16:07.155
I UNDERSTAND WHERE SHE WAS

1:16:07.155 --> 1:16:10.592
COMING FROM.

1:16:10.592 --> 1:16:12.728
I UNDERSTAND WHY SHE COULDN'T

1:16:12.728 --> 1:16:16.531
SEE PAST IT.

1:16:16.531 --> 1:16:17.899
BUT I FEEL THAT,
AGAIN, LIKE, I

1:16:17.899 --> 1:16:19.768
STOPPED LISTENING WITH SUSIE.

1:16:19.768 --> 1:16:20.502
IT'S NOT THAT SHE STOPPED.

1:16:20.502 --> 1:16:21.136
SHE WAS STILL
TALKING, AND I WAS

1:16:21.136 --> 1:16:21.770
THE ONE THAT
DECIDED THAT I WAS

1:16:21.770 --> 1:16:21.970
DONE.

1:16:21.970 --> 1:16:24.106
>> YOU'RE GRASPING
AT STRAWS, IN

1:16:24.106 --> 1:16:24.373
MY MIND.

1:16:24.373 --> 1:16:25.707
THAT'S DONE,
GONE, AND HISTORY.

1:16:25.707 --> 1:16:27.075
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, BECAUSE

1:16:27.075 --> 1:16:28.243
SHE MADE THAT CHOICE TO WALK.

1:16:28.243 --> 1:16:32.014
SHE MADE THE CHOICE --

1:16:32.014 --> 1:16:35.150
>> SHE TALKED
ALL THE WAY UNTIL

1:16:35.150 --> 1:16:37.286
I OPEN THE DOOR
FOR HER AND TOLD

1:16:37.286 --> 1:16:39.588
HER TO GO.

1:16:39.588 --> 1:16:41.590
>> SO IF YOU FELT SO STRONGLY

1:16:41.590 --> 1:16:43.258
ABOUT HER, WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP

1:16:43.258 --> 1:16:45.093
HER THEN AND THERE?

1:16:45.093 --> 1:16:48.897
>> BECAUSE AGAIN, I FELT

1:16:48.897 --> 1:16:49.498
OVERWHELMED AND OVERCOME WITH

1:16:49.498 --> 1:16:51.233
EMOTION.

1:16:51.233 --> 1:16:53.235
BUT NOW THROUGH
TALKING TO YOU,

1:16:53.235 --> 1:16:58.273
I REALIZE THAT I DO THINK I

1:16:58.273 --> 1:16:58.807
COULD GET THROUGH TO HER.

1:16:58.807 --> 1:17:03.745
>> CLAYTON, I ACTUALLY, WHEN

1:17:03.745 --> 1:17:04.346
SOMEBODY WALKS AWAY FROM YOU,

1:17:04.346 --> 1:17:04.946
THEY'RE WALKING AWAY FROM YOU

1:17:04.946 --> 1:17:05.347
AND THEY'RE DONE.

1:17:05.347 --> 1:17:06.748
IT'S FINISHED.

1:17:06.748 --> 1:17:08.483
I THINK YOU'RE
TOO CAUGHT UP IN

1:17:08.483 --> 1:17:10.385
"THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY."

1:17:10.385 --> 1:17:11.687
>> SHE COULD HAVE
WALKED OUT AT

1:17:11.687 --> 1:17:11.987
ANY MOMENT.

1:17:11.987 --> 1:17:14.856
>> SHE DID WALK OUT.

1:17:14.856 --> 1:17:16.425
>> I MEAN, AGAIN, IT'S LIKE, I

1:17:16.425 --> 1:17:18.960
KNOW YOU MET THESE
TWO WOMEN AND

1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:20.629
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THIS THIRD

1:17:20.629 --> 1:17:22.564
PERSON IS WITH
SUSIE, BUT LIKE,

1:17:22.564 --> 1:17:24.199
SHE HAD EVERYTHING.

1:17:24.199 --> 1:17:26.034
SHE WAS SOMEBODY THAT I WAS

1:17:26.034 --> 1:17:28.570
LIKE, THIS IS A

1:17:28.570 --> 1:17:29.237
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME KIND OF

1:17:29.237 --> 1:17:29.705
WOMAN.

1:17:29.705 --> 1:17:30.772
>> BUT THEN YOU WERE INTIMATE

1:17:30.772 --> 1:17:33.041
WITH THESE OTHER TWO WOMEN.

1:17:33.041 --> 1:17:35.544
WHY DID YOU SCREW THAT UP?

1:17:35.544 --> 1:17:38.313
>> YOU KNOW WHAT,
DOORS MIGHT BE

1:17:38.313 --> 1:17:42.351
CLOSED.

1:17:42.351 --> 1:17:44.052
THEY MIGHT BE.

1:17:44.052 --> 1:17:46.421
MAY BE MY CONNECTION ISN'T AS

1:17:46.421 --> 1:17:48.857
STRONG WITH SUSIE AS I THINK.

1:17:48.857 --> 1:17:49.891
MAYBE THESE WOMEN ARE NOT FAR

1:17:49.891 --> 1:17:52.527
BEHIND.

1:17:52.527 --> 1:17:55.197
MAYBE THERE'S A CHANCE.

1:17:55.197 --> 1:17:56.198
THERE COULD BE.

1:17:56.198 --> 1:17:56.865
BUT YOU TOLD ME TO FOLLOW MY

1:17:56.865 --> 1:17:57.065
HEART?

1:17:57.065 --> 1:17:57.699
AND GUESS WHAT, IF IT GOES AND

1:17:57.699 --> 1:17:58.333
GETS HEARTBROKEN
AND I BREAK MY

1:17:58.333 --> 1:17:59.134
OWN HEART IN THE
PROCESS, SO BE

1:17:59.134 --> 1:17:59.301
IT.

1:17:59.301 --> 1:18:00.435
I KNOW THAT MY
HEART IS TELLING

1:18:00.435 --> 1:18:01.603
ME TO GO DO THIS.

1:18:01.603 --> 1:18:04.106
AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK, IT

1:18:04.106 --> 1:18:06.575
DOESN'T WORK.

1:18:06.575 --> 1:18:09.111
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I CAN

1:18:09.111 --> 1:18:09.611
TELL YOU.

1:18:09.611 --> 1:18:10.112
ALL I NEED IS A CHANCE.

1:18:10.112 --> 1:18:10.912
>> I JUST AM SHOCKED.

1:18:10.912 --> 1:18:11.546
I'M TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY THAT HE

1:18:11.546 --> 1:18:12.681
IS IN LOVE WITH SUSIE.

1:18:12.681 --> 1:18:13.949
THIS IS TOO MUCH PRESSURE

1:18:13.949 --> 1:18:15.217
>> IF YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S A

1:18:15.217 --> 1:18:16.585
CHANCE, AND EVEN IF THERE IS

1:18:16.585 --> 1:18:17.753
WITH SUSIE, IF
THAT FEELS RIGHT

1:18:17.753 --> 1:18:20.288
TO YOU, THEN FOLLOW THAT.

1:18:20.288 --> 1:18:22.157
>> ARE YOU ABLE
TO REACH OUT TO

1:18:22.157 --> 1:18:24.025
HER, OR NOT?

1:18:24.025 --> 1:18:27.529
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1:18:27.529 --> 1:18:29.297
I DON'T KNOW.

1:18:29.297 --> 1:18:30.732
>> EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENED

1:18:30.732 --> 1:18:33.034
UP UNTIL NOW HAS COMPLETELY

1:18:33.034 --> 1:18:35.670
SHOCKED ME.

1:18:35.670 --> 1:18:36.271
I'M LIKE, "THERE'S NO WAY THAT

1:18:36.271 --> 1:18:36.772
THIS KID CAN SURPRISE ME

1:18:36.772 --> 1:18:37.038
ANYMORE."

1:18:37.038 --> 1:18:44.413
AND THEN BOOM, I'M WRONG.

1:18:44.413 --> 1:18:46.314
>> SO, A LOT HAPPENED IN THE

1:18:46.314 --> 1:18:48.483
LAST THREE DAYS, REALLY.

1:18:48.483 --> 1:18:50.285
I'VE BEEN THERE FOR ALL OF IT.

1:18:50.285 --> 1:18:51.086
NO ONE REALLY
SAW IT COMING, TO

1:18:51.086 --> 1:18:52.587
BE HONEST.

1:18:52.587 --> 1:18:53.021
I WAS VERY SHOCKED.

1:18:53.021 --> 1:18:53.889
AND IT WAS EMOTIONAL.

1:18:53.889 --> 1:18:55.590
HE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

1:18:55.590 --> 1:18:57.526
IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT
FOR ME, KIND

1:18:57.526 --> 1:18:59.995
OF WATCHING IT,
BECAUSE I CARE A

1:18:59.995 --> 1:19:01.163
LOT ABOUT YOUR SON AND I WANT

1:19:01.163 --> 1:19:03.765
HIM TO BE HAPPY.

1:19:03.765 --> 1:19:06.334
CLAYTON, YOU GOT TWO WOMEN,

1:19:06.334 --> 1:19:07.302
RACHEL AND GABBY.

1:19:07.302 --> 1:19:09.371
YOU TOLD THEM YOU LOVE THEM.

1:19:09.371 --> 1:19:12.374
THEY MET YOUR PARENTS.

1:19:12.374 --> 1:19:14.075
THEY'VE MET YOUR FAMILY.

1:19:14.075 --> 1:19:16.611
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

1:19:16.611 --> 1:19:18.880
>> FOLLOW MY HEART, I THINK.

1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:19.648
I JUST WANT
CLOSURE WITH SUSIE.

1:19:19.648 --> 1:19:21.650
AT LEAST, LIKE, I JUST WANT TO

1:19:21.650 --> 1:19:23.018
TALK TO HER AGAIN.

1:19:23.018 --> 1:19:24.953
I FEEL THAT WHAT WE HAD WAS

1:19:24.953 --> 1:19:28.990
ONE-OF-A-KIND AND
I'M WILLING TO

1:19:28.990 --> 1:19:30.926
SEE IF THERE'S STILL SOMETHING

1:19:30.926 --> 1:19:32.227
THERE.

1:19:32.227 --> 1:19:33.728
>> CLAYTON, SUSIE'S STILL IN

1:19:33.728 --> 1:19:34.996
ICELAND.

1:19:34.996 --> 1:19:36.231
>> I DIDN'T REALIZE SHE WAS

1:19:36.231 --> 1:19:40.936
STILL HERE.

1:19:40.936 --> 1:19:45.507
SO AGAIN, I JUST WANT ONE MORE

1:19:45.507 --> 1:19:46.074
SHOT.

1:19:46.074 --> 1:19:49.511
THAT'S ALL I CAN ASK FOR.

1:19:49.511 --> 1:19:51.746
AT LEAST I'LL HAVE AN ANSWER.

1:19:51.746 --> 1:19:52.347
>> WELL, WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO

1:19:52.347 --> 1:19:52.948
KNOW FOR SURE AFTER TOMORROW?

1:19:52.948 --> 1:19:53.548
YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW HOW THIS

1:19:53.548 --> 1:19:53.949
WHOLE THING ENDS.

1:19:53.949 --> 1:20:00.889
YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW THAT WITH

1:20:00.889 --> 1:20:09.064
CERTAINTY.

1:20:09.064 --> 1:20:20.141
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

1:20:20.141 --> 1:20:20.709
>> Jesse: SUSIE IS STILL IN

1:20:20.709 --> 1:20:21.276
ICELAND IN CLAYTON'S ROAD TO

1:20:21.276 --> 1:20:21.643
SCOTLAND PIECES.

1:20:21.643 --> 1:20:22.244
SO WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?

1:20:22.244 --> 1:20:22.878
IS SUSIE GOING
TO BE WILLING TO

1:20:22.878 --> 1:20:23.445
OPEN THAT DOOR AGAIN?

1:20:23.445 --> 1:20:25.614
LET'S SAY HELLO TO A COUPLE OF

1:20:25.614 --> 1:20:28.650
PEOPLE THAT KNOW
A THING OR TWO

1:20:28.650 --> 1:20:34.356
ABOUT LOVE AND DRAMA.

1:20:34.356 --> 1:20:35.023
I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE ALL HERE.

1:20:35.023 --> 1:20:37.692
LET'S GET RIGHT INTO IT.

1:20:37.692 --> 1:20:40.562
SO, SUSIE IS STILL IN ICELAND

1:20:40.562 --> 1:20:41.730
AND CLAYTON AT
THIS POINT SEEMS

1:20:41.730 --> 1:20:42.597
VERY INTENT ON PURSUING HER.

1:20:42.597 --> 1:20:45.233
WHAT SHOULD CLAYTON DO?

1:20:45.233 --> 1:20:46.768
>> I STILL NEED A SECOND.

1:20:46.768 --> 1:20:47.502
I'M STILL PROCESSING.

1:20:47.502 --> 1:20:51.206
DID YOU SAY, WHAT
SHOULD HE DO?

1:20:51.206 --> 1:20:51.806
OH, MY GOSH.

1:20:51.806 --> 1:20:52.841
HE'S ALREADY IN SOME MUDDY

1:20:52.841 --> 1:20:53.141
WATERS.

1:20:53.141 --> 1:20:54.910
SO I THINK AT THIS POINT, HE

1:20:54.910 --> 1:20:56.378
EVEN SAID, IF IT
BREAKS HIS OWN

1:20:56.378 --> 1:20:59.447
THE HEART, YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA

1:20:59.447 --> 1:21:01.449
BREAK SOMEBODY'S HEART IN THIS

1:21:01.449 --> 1:21:02.350
PROCESS.

1:21:02.350 --> 1:21:03.518
HE HAS SOMETHING
IN COMMON WITH

1:21:03.518 --> 1:21:06.788
ME AND THAT IS A
VICTIM OF BEING

1:21:06.788 --> 1:21:08.023
IN THE MOMENT A
LITTLE TOO MUCH

1:21:08.023 --> 1:21:10.292
AND HE'S DONE THAT WITH EACH

1:21:10.292 --> 1:21:11.660
WOMAN WHICH HAS BEEN A REALLY

1:21:11.660 --> 1:21:14.129
GREAT BUT ALSO, AT THE SAME

1:21:14.129 --> 1:21:15.997
TIME, IT'S GOING TO HURT

1:21:15.997 --> 1:21:17.599
SOMEBODY DEEPLY, AND IN THIS

1:21:17.599 --> 1:21:20.368
CASE, MULTIPLE PEOPLE DEEPLY.

1:21:20.368 --> 1:21:21.336
SO HE HAS TO PURSUE IT THE

1:21:21.336 --> 1:21:22.304
PERSON THAT HE
ACTUALLY SEES HIS

1:21:22.304 --> 1:21:26.741
LIFE WITH, EVEN IF THE SUSIE

1:21:26.741 --> 1:21:27.442
COULD SAY NO.

1:21:27.442 --> 1:21:30.745
HE HAS TO TAKE THE RISK.

1:21:30.745 --> 1:21:31.813
>> Jesse: CASSIE, IT'S SO

1:21:31.813 --> 1:21:32.948
GREAT HAVING YOU BACK, FIRST

1:21:32.948 --> 1:21:33.114
OFF.

1:21:33.114 --> 1:21:34.716
I KNOW THIS IS UNIQUE FOR YOU.

1:21:34.716 --> 1:21:36.384
YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING

1:21:36.384 --> 1:21:37.452
PERSPECTIVE ON THIS BECAUSE OF

1:21:37.452 --> 1:21:38.853
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND

1:21:38.853 --> 1:21:39.120
COLTON.

1:21:39.120 --> 1:21:40.522
IF CLAYTON DOES
DECIDE TO PURSUE

1:21:40.522 --> 1:21:44.059
A SUSIE, WHAT SHOULD SUSIE DO?

1:21:44.059 --> 1:21:48.730
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK, I

1:21:48.730 --> 1:21:50.065
DEFINITELY WAS HAVING DEJA VU

1:21:50.065 --> 1:21:52.000
WATCHING THIS, FOR SURE.

1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.970
AND I KNOW EVERY
SITUATION IS SO

1:21:54.970 --> 1:21:55.704
DIFFERENT.

1:21:55.704 --> 1:21:57.238
I THINK THE FACT
THAT SUSIE LEFT

1:21:57.238 --> 1:22:00.709
IN THE FIRST
PLACE JUST KIND OF

1:22:00.709 --> 1:22:01.776
SHOWS, YOU KNOW, SHE REALLY

1:22:01.776 --> 1:22:02.677
STUCK WITH HER
INTUITION AND WAS

1:22:02.677 --> 1:22:04.846
LIGHT, AS HARD AS IT WAS, SHE

1:22:04.846 --> 1:22:07.582
HAD TO LEAVE.

1:22:07.582 --> 1:22:10.585
AND I HOPE THAT IF HE DOES GO

1:22:10.585 --> 1:22:11.586
BACK WHICH IS SEEMING VERY

1:22:11.586 --> 1:22:14.155
POSSIBLE THAT HE'S GOING TO,

1:22:14.155 --> 1:22:17.092
THAT SHE JUST DOESN'T FEEL

1:22:17.092 --> 1:22:17.592
PRESSURE, WHETHER THAT'S

1:22:17.592 --> 1:22:18.893
PRESSURE FROM HIM TO HAVE A

1:22:18.893 --> 1:22:21.229
RELATIONSHIP OR
PRESSURE TO GIVE

1:22:21.229 --> 1:22:26.034
A HAPPY ENDING TO THE SHOW OR

1:22:26.034 --> 1:22:27.202
PRESSURE BECAUSE, WHEN SHE

1:22:27.202 --> 1:22:29.738
INITIALLY CAME
ON THE SHOW, SHE

1:22:29.738 --> 1:22:31.840
WANTED TO FIND SOMETHING, YOU

1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:32.140
KNOW?

1:22:32.140 --> 1:22:34.442
AND SHE MIGHT BE
LIVING IN THIS

1:22:34.442 --> 1:22:35.343
IDEALISTIC WORLD.

1:22:35.343 --> 1:22:37.012
BUT YEAH, I JUST HOPE THAT SHE

1:22:37.012 --> 1:22:40.548
STICKS WITH HER INTUITION AND

1:22:40.548 --> 1:22:42.384
REALLY IS IN THE MOMENT IN A

1:22:42.384 --> 1:22:45.153
GOOD WAY, WHERE SHE IS NOT

1:22:45.153 --> 1:22:46.154
LOOKING AT WHAT
SHE WANTED TO BE

1:22:46.154 --> 1:22:52.594
BUT FOR WHAT IT IS.

1:22:52.594 --> 1:22:53.728
>> Jesse: IT RODNEY?

1:22:53.728 --> 1:22:54.963
I KNOW CLAYTON IS YOUR BOY.

1:22:54.963 --> 1:22:56.398
I KNOW THAT'S YOUR GUY.

1:22:56.398 --> 1:22:57.465
WHAT ADVICE DO
YOU HAVE FOR HIM

1:22:57.465 --> 1:22:59.334
RIGHT NOW?

1:22:59.334 --> 1:23:01.102
>> OH, MY GOD.

1:23:01.102 --> 1:23:02.971
IT'S SO TOUGH TO EVEN THINK

1:23:02.971 --> 1:23:04.539
ABOUT THE POSITION
HE'S IN RIGHT

1:23:04.539 --> 1:23:05.640
NOW.

1:23:05.640 --> 1:23:06.875
I JUST KNOW MOST IMPORTANTLY I

1:23:06.875 --> 1:23:08.810
WOULD JUST LET THEM KNOW, HEY,

1:23:08.810 --> 1:23:10.045
OBVIOUSLY, NO MATTER WHAT, YOU

1:23:10.045 --> 1:23:12.180
GOT TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART.

1:23:12.180 --> 1:23:13.882
AS YOU CAN SEE, CLAYTON IS A

1:23:13.882 --> 1:23:15.050
VERY PASSIONATE GUY.

1:23:15.050 --> 1:23:17.552
WHEN HE FALLS, HE FALLS HARD.

1:23:17.552 --> 1:23:20.755
I WOULD ALSO TELL
HIM, HEY, MORE

1:23:20.755 --> 1:23:21.656
IMPORTANTLY, YOU JUST HAVE TO

1:23:21.656 --> 1:23:23.458
THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK.

1:23:23.458 --> 1:23:24.526
I KNOW WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

1:23:24.526 --> 1:23:25.727
DISCUSSIONS AND I CAN ONLY

1:23:25.727 --> 1:23:27.162
IMAGINE WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO BE IN

1:23:27.162 --> 1:23:30.065
THAT POSITION, BUT AS YOU CAN

1:23:30.065 --> 1:23:31.499
SEE, HE IS VERY
HONEST AND LIKE
