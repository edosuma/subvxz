00:02.000 --> 00:07.160
This programme contains
strong language and adult humour.

00:11.520 --> 00:15.880
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys.

00:15.880 --> 00:18.400
# She's Mrs Brown

00:18.400 --> 00:21.400
# That's Mrs Brown

00:21.400 --> 00:23.400
# Our Mrs Brown. #

00:26.920 --> 00:28.680
CHEERING

00:30.240 --> 00:35.600
And now perhaps you might
sing us a song, little chicken.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.040
# Cluck-cluck, cluck, cluck-cluck
Cluck-cluck, cluck-cluck. #

00:39.040 --> 00:44.120
Oh, very, very good.
Do I sense the arrival of an egg?

00:44.120 --> 00:46.160
CROWD: Ooh!

00:47.280 --> 00:48.720
I think it's hard boiled.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.200
When I count back from three and
click my fingers, you will wake up

00:53.200 --> 00:55.680
and remember nothing at all.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.800
Three, two, one.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.800
APPLAUSE

01:02.800 --> 01:07.720
I'm Simon Lavine,
and that's what I call hypnosis.

01:07.720 --> 01:08.960
Thank you very much.

01:08.960 --> 01:12.040
Thank you, ladies, thank you.
Thank you!

01:14.960 --> 01:18.000
You were great Mrs McGoogan,
very funny!

01:18.000 --> 01:21.560
Do you think so?
Sure, I only had to sit there.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.360
I tell you, Maria, this is one
of the best christening parties

01:26.360 --> 01:27.840
I've been ever at.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.760
Oh, thanks, Mrs McGoogan,

01:29.760 --> 01:32.520
with it being triplets, Mummy wanted
to make it a bit special.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.440
What? What was special?

01:34.440 --> 01:36.640
Winnie was just saying
the christening was great.

01:36.640 --> 01:40.040
Oh, it was fantastic, Maria,
three beautiful boys.

01:40.040 --> 01:43.760
I hate the feckin' names
you picked.

01:43.760 --> 01:46.560
It was Dermot who wanted to
call them after The Beatles.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.320
John, George and Ringo.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.360
That's a terrible name to
have to live with. I know.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.280
When he grows up and the teacher
asks his name,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.400
he's to stand up in front of
the whole school

01:56.400 --> 01:58.560
and say fuckin' "George".

02:01.120 --> 02:03.160
Wasn't the hypnotist great?

02:03.160 --> 02:04.640
Winnie, you were very funny.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.360
I did nothing, Agnes.

02:06.360 --> 02:10.040
Oh, you did more than I did, I just
sat up there like a feckin' eejit.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.520
Mrs Brown,
you really don't remember?

02:12.520 --> 02:13.560
Remember what?

02:14.680 --> 02:16.680
Everyone enjoying themselves?

02:16.680 --> 02:17.760
Up to now, yes.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.720
Hope I'm not over-dressed for this
place, this is a Louise Kennedy.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.000
Hope it fits her better
than it fits you.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.920
Louise Kennedy is a top designer.

02:28.920 --> 02:29.960
That's nice.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.640
Mammy!

02:33.640 --> 02:36.400
Well, drink up, girls, and then
it's everyone back to our house.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.520
Ooh! Are you coming, Agnes?

02:38.520 --> 02:41.400
No, I'd better get home to Grandad,
he's been on his own all day.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.280
Well, the champagne's sitting on ice.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.480
Grandad is probably
sitting in shite.

02:48.720 --> 02:51.560
I must say, Agnes,
you are a good sport,

02:51.560 --> 02:53.560
you were really quite funny
up on that stage.

02:53.560 --> 02:54.960
When? What do you mean?

02:54.960 --> 02:56.640
She doesn't remember anything, Mum.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.440
Really?

03:00.880 --> 03:03.240
What? What's she laughing at?
What's she laughing at?

03:03.240 --> 03:05.160
Never mind, Mrs Brown.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.400
Are we going back to
Nicholson's for champers?

03:07.400 --> 03:11.320
Let's go, I'll call Rory
and tell him where we're going.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.200
Betty. Oh, we're heading back
to Nicholson's.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.680
Did you say anything to Mammy?

03:15.680 --> 03:18.360
No, and don't you say anything
either.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.160
Not today, let her enjoy her day.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.360
You're right.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.320
What's that about?

03:24.320 --> 03:26.080
I nearly shot myself in the foot.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.440
My uncle shot
himself in the foot once.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.880
He was out hunting mushrooms.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.960
Are you going home to Grandad now
or will you have another one?

03:38.960 --> 03:40.560
Actually, go on, I might as well.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.040
I may as well feckin' hose him
down as bath him.

03:46.480 --> 03:47.880
Hello!

03:47.880 --> 03:50.720
Well, you just missed
a fantastic day.

03:50.720 --> 03:54.120
Poor Father Damien, he never
christened triplets before.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.840
He nearly ran out of fuckin' water.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.280
He should've used a hose.

03:59.960 --> 04:04.320
Oh, I love days like this,
you know, family days.

04:04.320 --> 04:07.000
There's nothing better than
having your family round you.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.800
I'm a very lucky mother
and grandmother.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.520
I saw you talking to yourself again.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.080
You usually do
that at home in your kitchen.

04:16.080 --> 04:17.680
Yeah, well, it's a new series.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.560
Thought I'd move it around a bit.

04:21.960 --> 04:24.440
You were very hard on Mrs Nicholson.
Oh.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.240
Ah, she was only trying to be nice.

04:26.240 --> 04:29.200
I'm sorry, it's just that every time
that woman gives me a compliment,

04:29.200 --> 04:31.880
I feel like she's
waiting on a fuckin' receipt.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.520
Bono's nose is out of joint.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.160
Ah, yes.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.400
He doesn't like having to
share his gran.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.720
No, he doesn't.

04:41.720 --> 04:46.080
I just told him we love him so much
we got him three new cousins.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.120
I'm not sure that's the way
to tell him, Agnes.

04:48.120 --> 04:49.240
Why not?

04:49.240 --> 04:51.320
Well, imagine
if your Redser had come home

04:51.320 --> 04:53.560
and he said, "Listen, Agnes,
I love you so much

04:53.560 --> 04:55.440
"I'm bringing another woman home."

04:55.440 --> 04:57.440
What would you have said to that?

04:57.440 --> 04:58.840
I hope she fuckin' cooks.

05:03.800 --> 05:08.600
"For sale, herd of cows,
never been bred.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.680
"Also for sale, gay bull."

05:15.160 --> 05:16.240
Morning.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.720
Moo.

05:25.080 --> 05:28.400
Good morning, love, have a
cup of tea? Thanks, Mammy.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.760
You look a bit down, love,
are you all right?

05:31.760 --> 05:33.480
It's trying to get an apartment.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.200
There's nothing going that me
and Dino can afford.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.720
You just have to be patient, love.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.160
We can't be patient, Mammy.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.680
Dino's in his last week in the place
he's in now.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.520
We have to get
somewhere by the end of the week.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.440
Tea, love? Just a quick one,
Mammy, I have a headache.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.880
Hangover, more like.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.560
Good night at the Nicholsons'
last night? Great.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.520
Isn't their kitchen just beautiful?

05:53.520 --> 05:56.040
Amazing, you could live in it.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.400
Ha, a kitchen's a kitchen,
as long as it's cosy and functional,

05:59.400 --> 06:00.960
like this one.

06:02.480 --> 06:06.120
Excuse me, everything in this
kitchen has always worked,

06:06.120 --> 06:07.320
except your father.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.880
Maybe it could do with
a lick of paint.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.040
This needs more than
a lick of paint, Mammy,

06:14.040 --> 06:16.240
you need to give it a facelift.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.040
This kitchen was built to last.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.960
It even has fuckin' automatic doors.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.320
These things cost money, Cathy.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.000
Mammy, your eldest son is
a carpenter.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.920
That's true. And he could use the
work, especially now.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.560
Ouch!

06:41.560 --> 06:43.320
Mammy, she's after kicking me!

06:43.320 --> 06:46.040
Well, that was a very stagey fuckin'
"Ouch."

06:47.480 --> 06:48.520
Ouch!

06:49.520 --> 06:50.680
Eek!

06:50.680 --> 06:53.040
Can we try that again?

06:53.040 --> 06:54.640
Really fuckin' kick him.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.040
Mammy, your eldest son is
a carpenter. True.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.880
And he could use the work,
especially now.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.440
Ouch!

07:06.360 --> 07:08.400
Sorry.

07:08.400 --> 07:12.280
Let me just show you the sound
I'm really fuckin' looking for.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.280
You don't be kicking him,

07:15.280 --> 07:19.000
or I'm telling you I'll take those
good knickers off you.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.320
What do you mean, now?

07:22.080 --> 07:27.000
Nothing, I just mean that now
might be a good time to do it.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
I have to go, I'll be home on me
lunch break, Mammy. Bye.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.360
Wait, Rory!
I'll walk to the bus with you.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.760
Mammy, I'm meeting Thomas later
so I won't need dinner.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.680
Why? Are you going to eat, Thomas?

07:36.680 --> 07:38.000
Don't answer that.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.640
Hiya, Winnie.

07:40.640 --> 07:44.160
How are ya, Cathy, love?

07:44.160 --> 07:45.520
That's loose.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.600
Well spotted.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.080
The christening was great.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.480
Oh, it was fantastic.
Do you want tea?

07:51.480 --> 07:52.840
Oh, yes, please, Agnes.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.720
Winnie,
you were very funny on that stage.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.600
Sure, I did nothing.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.000
When you did the chicken. It was
very funny.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.480
All he had to say was the magic
words - finger lickin' good.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.920
Cluck! cluck-cluck-cluck!

08:14.000 --> 08:17.280
And then he just clicked his fingers

08:17.280 --> 08:19.640
and you didn't remember anything.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.560
Remember what?

08:24.560 --> 08:26.160
About the fuckin' chicken.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.400
Hello, Ma.

08:28.400 --> 08:32.880
Hello, son.
Oh, this is an unexpected surprise.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.920
Oh, we're just dropping Bono
to school and thought we'd drop in.

08:35.920 --> 08:37.480
Well, you're just in time for tea.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.080
And we'd like to have a
chat with you. Sure.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.720
In private. Winnie.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.960
Yeah? They'd like to talk private.
Oh.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.280
Mum-um-um-um-um...

08:46.280 --> 08:48.960
Winnie! Family business, fuck off.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.560
What is it, love?

08:55.560 --> 08:57.840
I'm being made redundant, Ma,
in three weeks.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.080
Oh, I'm sorry, love.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.440
But, you know, sometimes
these things work out

09:01.440 --> 09:02.960
just the way they're supposed to.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.160
I was just thinking about getting
the kitchen done.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.920
You can do that while you're
waiting on another job, and then

09:07.920 --> 09:11.000
I can pay you. I'd rather pay
you than pay anybody else.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.240
Hello there.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.680
You're just in time.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.360
Screw yourself
into that door there, will you?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.000
Go on, you know the drill.

09:30.360 --> 09:34.280
Did you want a cup of tea or
did you just come for a charge?

09:34.280 --> 09:36.920
Betty, just the girl,
could you do me a favour?

09:36.920 --> 09:39.240
It's the toy fair tomorrow,
and the boss is looking for

09:39.240 --> 09:42.240
a pretty blonde to play
a kind of a Barbie doll.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.240
Oh, jeez, Betty,
you could help there,

09:44.240 --> 09:46.000
you must know a pretty blonde.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.720
Ma! I meant Betty.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.320
And who's going to play Ken?

09:50.320 --> 09:51.520
Me!

09:53.120 --> 09:55.680
Are they dolls,
will they damage in a fire?

09:57.200 --> 09:58.440
Hilarious.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.320
Do you fancy it, Betty?

10:01.320 --> 10:04.400
No, Dermot, not with Bono in school,
but thanks for asking.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.680
No bother,
I have someone else in mind anyway.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.600
How are yas? Hiya, Buster.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.240
Did you want me for something,
Dermo?

10:11.240 --> 10:13.600
Dermot,
we wanted to have a chat with Ma.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.880
No bother. Buster, in there.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.200
See, the thing is, Ma...

10:21.200 --> 10:22.280
KNOCKING

10:22.280 --> 10:23.880
Hello, help! >

10:23.880 --> 10:25.360
Just give me a minute.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.520
Jesus!

10:26.520 --> 10:27.680
Mark, we have to.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.520
I'm coming, Grandad.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.880
I didn't do anything!

10:32.880 --> 10:34.000
I know but you will.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.840
< Help me!

10:35.840 --> 10:38.760
I'm coming, for God's sake,
keep your fecking clothes on.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.560
So, what did you want me for, Dermo?

10:40.560 --> 10:43.040
Firstly, me mother-in-law
wants her afghan back.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.040
Dermo, I swear, it followed me home.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.640
Buster, it's a rug.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.480
Fair enough. It's in the car.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.120
You still driving that banger?

10:56.120 --> 10:57.960
It gets me from A to...

10:57.960 --> 11:00.000
A.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.520
When it starts.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.800
< Get back into the bed. Get into...

11:04.800 --> 11:06.720
< Look at my lips!

11:06.720 --> 11:07.760
< Up here!

11:10.560 --> 11:12.360
< Get into...

11:12.360 --> 11:13.400
You OK, Mammy?

11:14.960 --> 11:18.000
It's your Grandad, he knocked over
his glass of water in his sleep.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.880
Now I can't find his fuckin' teeth.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.280
He won't get back into bed.
He thinks they're in the bed

11:23.280 --> 11:26.480
and they're going to chew
the balls off him.

11:26.480 --> 11:30.640
Get in! Get in, you feck!
Get into the bed!

11:30.640 --> 11:32.240
So, what's the other thing, Dermo?

11:32.240 --> 11:33.560
I have a day's work for you.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.880
Meet me at the toy fair
at nine in the morning.

11:35.880 --> 11:39.480
That's great.
See you in the morning.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.360
I'll see yas.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.360
Mark, do you want me
to say it to her?

11:45.360 --> 11:47.720
No, I'll tell her. Jesus.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.800
Mark? Any chance of a push?

11:49.800 --> 11:51.960
No.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.240
It wasn't long ago
we had a car like that.

11:54.240 --> 11:57.360
Fine, then.
OK, Buster, I'll give you a push.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.920
< Oh, thanks, Mark.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.400
Where are ya?

12:00.400 --> 12:01.920
< Over here, on the swing.

12:05.640 --> 12:06.920
Right, see yas.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.520
< Dermot, give us a push will ya?

12:10.520 --> 12:11.880
< No.

12:11.880 --> 12:15.160
Sorry about that, love.
Now, where was I?

12:15.160 --> 12:17.880
Oh, yes, the kitchen.
You could do that.

12:17.880 --> 12:21.000
I can't Ma, I don't want the job
that I might not be here to finish.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.240
What do you mean?

12:22.240 --> 12:25.400
Mrs Brown, there's no work out
there. In three weeks, Mark is

12:25.400 --> 12:28.480
finished, and the chance of getting
a job is, well, there's nothing.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.440
I know you feel like that, Betty,
but you mustn't give up hope.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.040
We're not giving up, Mrs Brown.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.000
I've found some work

12:35.000 --> 12:36.400
in Australia.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.520
Oh, Jesus,
we'll miss you, won't we, son?

12:42.720 --> 12:45.600
Ma, we're all going to Australia.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.920
When do we leave?

12:48.480 --> 12:49.840
Mammy.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.680
I, I was just trying
to make light of it.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.600
Good for you.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.280
You're right, you have to make
a life for yourselves

12:57.280 --> 13:00.880
and if you can't make it here,
then you go wherever you can.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.960
Thanks, Ma, I knew you'd understand.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.480
And you can visit. It's not that far.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.520
Of course I will.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.160
I'm getting excited now.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.600
Well, we're not there yet -
we still have to get the visas.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.280
Let's go to the embassy now.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.400
OK, let's go. See ya, Ma.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.560
See yas.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.600
How is she?

13:32.600 --> 13:36.560
All right, I think.
But you know Mammy, Rory,

13:36.560 --> 13:38.960
she's putting on a brave face,
but, well...

13:38.960 --> 13:43.120
I know, under that hard exterior

13:43.120 --> 13:44.920
is another hard exterior.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.720
Stop, don't make me laugh.

13:49.720 --> 13:52.240
Emigrating to Australia?

13:52.240 --> 13:53.280
Yes.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.320
That's a long way away.

13:55.320 --> 13:56.600
I know.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.320
That's further than America.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.040
I know.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.560
The other side of the world, it is.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.080
I fuckin' know.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.760
It's miles and miles away.

14:08.760 --> 14:12.600
Winnie, don't volunteer
for The Samaritans.

14:12.600 --> 14:13.720
I'm just saying.

14:16.520 --> 14:19.680
I had an auntie,
emigrated to America.

14:19.680 --> 14:23.760
We never heard from her again,
not even a letter.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.640
Was this the one that
was on the Titanic?

14:26.640 --> 14:27.880
Yeah.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.640
We never heard from her again.

14:38.640 --> 14:41.160
Where are they going in Australia?

14:41.160 --> 14:44.600
Somewhere outside Sydney.
Poitier or something like that.

14:46.160 --> 14:50.280
Oh, Rory, you missed it
at the christening party in Foley's.

14:50.280 --> 14:54.440
I heard the hypnotist was brilliant
and Mammy was really funny.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.400
Oh, it was hilarious.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.720
What did he get her to do?

14:57.720 --> 15:00.160
When he had her under,
he said that every time

15:00.160 --> 15:03.880
he said the magic word, Mammy would
think she was an Alsatian dog.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.200
And she was hilarious.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.160
And then he just clicked his fingers
and she didn't even remember it.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.040
What was the magic word?

15:14.040 --> 15:15.320
Triplets.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.160
Woof! Woof!

15:17.160 --> 15:23.480
I suppose that's the way
it was with our children.

15:25.320 --> 15:29.480
One minute, they're little babies,
crawling on the ground...

15:32.720 --> 15:36.840
..and the next minute,
they're all grown up.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.360
Just like that.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.440
Am I right, Agnes?

15:45.720 --> 15:47.960
What? Right about what?

15:47.960 --> 15:49.720
Children growing up quick.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.320
Yeah.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.360
Then he told her
that when he said another word,

15:55.360 --> 15:57.520
Mammy would think she was
a stripper!

16:03.720 --> 16:05.120
What was that word?

16:05.120 --> 16:08.720
It was, oh, I can't remember,
but it was so funny.

16:09.840 --> 16:14.000
Fair play to that hypnotist,
he was on the ball, you know,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.560
it being the three
boys' christening, to pick
that word triplets.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.920
Woof! Woof!

16:25.200 --> 16:27.000
Throw the ball! Throw the ball!

16:29.520 --> 16:30.560
Aaargh!

16:32.440 --> 16:33.920
Throw the fucking ball!

16:34.920 --> 16:37.120
Rory, Cathy, help!

16:41.160 --> 16:44.480
It's your Mammy!
I think she's annoyed with me!

16:51.000 --> 16:53.280
Winnie, what the fuck is
wrong with you?

16:57.520 --> 17:00.760
We should contact that hypnotist
to take Mammy out of that.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.000
Yeah, we should.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.480
But not yet!

17:06.960 --> 17:08.400
To Australia!

17:08.400 --> 17:09.920
I wish you the best of luck, Betty.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.520
Thank you, Mrs Brown.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.200
You'll need it, I tell ya,
with all them snakes and sharks

17:14.200 --> 17:16.760
and poisonous spiders that
hide under the toilet seat.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.120
What? Yes.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.440
There's a reason they sent
convicts to Australia,

17:20.440 --> 17:22.960
it's a fuckin' death trap.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.080
It's not like that.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.200
A lot of Australians
live in really nice places.

17:26.200 --> 17:30.360
Yes, Dublin or London, as far
away from Australia as they can.

17:30.360 --> 17:31.680
Aye, yeah.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.040
Small sharks.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.440
What?

17:34.440 --> 17:37.480
Well, in the toilet, they'd
have to be small sharks.

17:41.480 --> 17:44.280
Winnie, go up and tell Mr Foley
that he wants you, will you?

17:44.280 --> 17:45.320
OK, love.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.840
I'm serious. Can you imagine sitting
in the toilet, and one of them

17:51.840 --> 17:54.920
creepy spiders crawling up
towards your ying yang?

17:54.920 --> 17:56.240
It's called a funnel web.

17:56.240 --> 17:59.320
You call yours what you like, love,
mine's a ying yang.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.440
How long will you stay there, Betty?

18:03.440 --> 18:07.680
Till she needs a shit, then she'll
be on the first plane home.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.520
You wait and see.

18:11.320 --> 18:12.880
Mr Foley said he didn't want me.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.920
I wish he'd make up his
feckin' mind.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.200
Have the two of you decided
where in Australia?

18:18.200 --> 18:20.080
Mark wants to go to Sydney.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.280
Jacko and me were in Australia.

18:22.280 --> 18:24.480
I didn't know that, where?

18:24.480 --> 18:26.040
Perth.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.240
I believe Perth is beautiful.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.960
We didn't like it, very cold,
and the people all spoke funny.

18:37.320 --> 18:38.800
Winnie, was it kind of like,

18:38.800 --> 18:41.160
"There's a moose
loose about this hoose?"

18:44.200 --> 18:46.760
You feckin' eejit.

18:46.760 --> 18:48.040
That's Canada.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.920
Well, at least we were there.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.600
Will you come to the toilet with me,
Agnes?

19:02.280 --> 19:03.720
Why?

19:03.720 --> 19:07.560
Well, in case there's one of them
spider thingies,

19:07.560 --> 19:10.720
and it might attack me ying yang.
That'd be fatal.

19:10.720 --> 19:11.760
For the spider.

19:13.880 --> 19:17.920
Winnie, you're all right, they won't
be there. It's only in Australia.

19:19.120 --> 19:22.240
C'mon, I'll go with you, c'mon.
Thanks, Agnes. Feck's sake.

19:23.800 --> 19:27.120
By the way, Maria, thanks for
a great night at the christening.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.400
Oh, we really wanted to mark
the occasion.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.480
It's not every day you get
to christen triplets.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.200
< Woof! Woof!

19:49.320 --> 19:51.080
Ya dirty bastard!

19:53.640 --> 19:55.320
What was that about?

19:55.320 --> 19:57.680
There's something
I meant to tell you.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.360
PHONE RINGS

20:01.360 --> 20:03.400
Phone! Phone!

20:05.200 --> 20:06.320
Phone!

20:06.320 --> 20:09.480
'Hello, this is Agnes Brown.
I'm not taking your call,

20:09.480 --> 20:12.600
'because I'm trying to avoid
somebody I don't like.

20:13.840 --> 20:17.040
'Please leave your number,
and if I don't call back, it's you.'

20:18.920 --> 20:20.040
BEEP

20:20.040 --> 20:21.200
'Hello, Mrs Brown.

20:21.200 --> 20:25.640
'Damien, Father Damien.
I'm on my way over to see you.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.680
'I heard about Mark emigrating

20:27.680 --> 20:29.840
'and I thought you could use
a little chat.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.080
'Hello?

20:31.080 --> 20:33.080
'I feckin' hate these things.'

20:37.800 --> 20:39.280
Phone!

20:39.280 --> 20:41.360
What's wrong with you?

20:41.360 --> 20:43.000
Phone!

20:43.000 --> 20:44.600
Priest.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.280
Message.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.680
I can't sleep!

20:51.280 --> 20:53.680
Does that smell
like chloroform to you?

20:57.320 --> 20:58.480
There we are.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.760
Hello, Ken!

21:08.040 --> 21:09.360
Are you on your own?

21:09.360 --> 21:11.280
No, Buster's with me.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.200
Come on, Buster.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.240
< I'm coming.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.880
Buster, sit down, son.

21:28.880 --> 21:33.440
No, I'll stand. I might damage
the box, and that affects the value.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.000
Do you want a cup of tea, love?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.560
No, Mammy, we just called to see
if you're OK.

21:39.640 --> 21:41.280
We heard about Mark.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.040
Do you want a cup of tea, son?

21:49.040 --> 21:51.480
No, Ma, we just called in to see
if you're OK.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.040
We heard about Mark.

22:01.960 --> 22:03.640
Close your fuckin' mouth.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.920
Would you like a cup of tea, son?

22:12.080 --> 22:13.520
No, Mammy.

22:16.880 --> 22:20.120
We just called in to see
if you're OK. We heard about Mark.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.560
It's fuckin' Hawaii Five-0 now.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.800
Would you like a cup of tea, son?

22:32.800 --> 22:35.400
No, Mammy, we just called in
to see if you're OK.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.440
We heard about Mark.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.360
It is what it is, I'm fine.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.600
Yeah.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.120
I might emigrate to Australia.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.640
Buster, they stopped taking
people like you in Australia

22:44.640 --> 22:45.800
200 years ago.

22:47.640 --> 22:49.800
Well, you're all right
anyway, are you, Mammy?

22:49.800 --> 22:50.840
I'm grand...

22:54.200 --> 22:55.720
I fucking can't...

23:03.800 --> 23:05.160
Oh, Jesus.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.520
OK, this time, this time, this time.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.280
Well, you're all right anyway,
are you, Mammy?

23:24.400 --> 23:27.000
I'm fine,
thanks for thinking about me, Elvis.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.640
Dermo, can I take a break?

23:32.640 --> 23:33.920
No.

23:33.920 --> 23:37.560
Aw, come on, Dermo, I just want
a chance to think outside the box.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.480
< Shut up, Buster.

23:42.120 --> 23:43.560
< Hiya, Mark! Hiya, Bono.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.040
Hiya, Ma! Hello, son.

23:46.040 --> 23:49.480
Oh, look at you, Bono.
So big.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.360
Ma, I'm looking for a certificate.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.400
It's for me application for
Australia.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.640
What kind of certificate?

23:56.640 --> 23:57.680
Baptism.

23:57.680 --> 24:01.240
Do you have any idea where it
might... I know where it is.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.400
I know where it is.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.080
Hiya, Bono!

24:06.520 --> 24:09.120
Are you sad? Aye.

24:09.120 --> 24:10.640
Do you want to see something funny?

24:10.640 --> 24:11.760
Aye.

24:11.760 --> 24:12.800
Watch this.

24:15.440 --> 24:16.560
Triplets!

24:16.560 --> 24:18.560
Woof! Woof!

24:34.200 --> 24:38.320
It's nice to see you smiling,
mister. What's so funny?

24:38.320 --> 24:39.920
Nothing, Granny.

24:39.920 --> 24:42.480
Right, that's me back to work,
I'll see yas later.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.800
See ya, love.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.240
I don't want to go to
Australia, Granny.

24:49.240 --> 24:52.680
Don't be silly, it'll be a great
adventure.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.440
New school, new friends.

24:54.440 --> 24:55.760
But no Granny.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.280
No.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.760
DOORBELL RINGS

24:59.760 --> 25:01.080
But I can visit.

25:01.080 --> 25:04.400
You wait and see, you'll be
sick of me out there, I swear.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.160
Hello, Father, c'mon in.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.640
You know,
I don't know a lot about Australia,

25:11.640 --> 25:15.120
but I know it has gorgeous beaches
and everybody has a sun tan.

25:15.120 --> 25:18.080
Really? Yes, it's like Skegness.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.080
I have a great idea.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.200
What?

25:22.200 --> 25:26.480
Mammy and Daddy can go to Australia,
and I will stay here with you.

25:26.480 --> 25:27.960
No.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.400
Please, Granny?

25:29.400 --> 25:31.000
Wait a second, Father.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.960
No, I wouldn't want you
here in my way, under me feet.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.720
No, go to Australia.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.320
But I won't be any trouble.

25:37.320 --> 25:40.120
No, you go to Australia
with your Mammy and your Daddy.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.440
Fine.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.640
I don't want to see you ever again!

25:47.480 --> 25:49.040
Bono!

25:50.800 --> 25:52.040
Thanks, Ma.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.280
Ah, hello, Mrs Brown!

25:57.280 --> 25:59.160
Oh, that's all I fuckin' need now.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.920
Hiya, Sharon.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.040
Ah, howya, Cathy?

26:06.040 --> 26:08.560
Here, do you remember
the hypnotist the other night?

26:08.560 --> 26:10.400
Yeah, why? What's he saying?

26:10.400 --> 26:12.840
That rash was there
before I went near him.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.760
No! Do you have a number for him?

26:17.760 --> 26:19.760
Oh, yeah, I have his card somewhere.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.040
Mammy is still hypnotised.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.240
Oh, here. Thanks.

26:25.240 --> 26:27.120
I couldn't remember
the other magic word,

26:27.120 --> 26:29.200
the one that turned
her into a stripper?

26:29.200 --> 26:31.400
Oh, yeah, baptism.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.120
I'm fine.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.440
I don't need counselling, I'm fine.

26:36.440 --> 26:42.040
OK, but still, I mean,
I haven't seen you since the baptism.

26:42.040 --> 26:45.280
I know you're upset about Mark
emigrating,

26:45.280 --> 26:48.280
but something many of my
parishioners have gone through,

26:48.280 --> 26:51.600
virtually on a daily basis.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.160
Mrs Brown?

26:57.880 --> 26:59.960
Mrs... Emigration isn't...

27:08.720 --> 27:09.920
Mrs Brown!

27:09.920 --> 27:11.680
Are you all right, Mrs Brown?

27:13.840 --> 27:15.760
There's no place like home!

27:15.760 --> 27:17.480
Mrs Brown! What are you doing?

27:25.800 --> 27:27.840
I really have to be leaving soon.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.640
Not yet, Mr Lavine.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.880
Cluck-cluck-cluck!

27:37.200 --> 27:38.440
Woof!

27:38.440 --> 27:40.320
Cluck! Cluck!

27:40.320 --> 27:41.880
Woof! Woof!

27:46.960 --> 27:48.720
Just a few more minutes.

27:48.720 --> 27:51.080
Woof! Woof!

27:51.080 --> 27:52.680
Good night.

27:54.920 --> 27:59.560
# Say hello
to the queen of Dublin town

28:01.120 --> 28:05.600
# As the best mum of all
She wears the crown

28:07.080 --> 28:10.200
# Mother hen watching all her chicks

28:10.200 --> 28:13.360
# Sassy old lady full of tricks

28:13.360 --> 28:18.080
# It's a safe bet she'd never let
life get her down

28:18.080 --> 28:22.240
# She's Mrs Brown

28:22.240 --> 28:25.200
# That's Mrs Brown

28:25.200 --> 28:27.280
# Our Mrs Brown. #

28:27.280 --> 28:28.840
