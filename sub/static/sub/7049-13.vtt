00:02.503 --> 00:03.795
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:03.879 --> 00:06.964
Devil, whatever led you
to believe that you could pull this off?

00:08.007 --> 00:09.133
Wait!

00:09.218 --> 00:10.927
Don't know why we're out here

00:11.011 --> 00:13.680
instead of just tossing this traitor
in a slurry pond.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.973
Devil was a friend before he became a traitor.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.267
Arlo!
Did you take your meds today?

00:21.313 --> 00:22.772
Arlo?

00:22.940 --> 00:26.275
Now, what I'd like to do is create a diversion.
Say, blow up a car.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.695
What if when that car blows up,
there's a man inside?

00:28.779 --> 00:30.780
And say that man had brilliant blue eyes?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.490
And a big, stupid baby head?

00:32.616 --> 00:36.160
Now, right out there in that truck, I got a box
full of Emulex with a cell-phone detonator.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.287
I believe I know how to blow up a car.

00:38.497 --> 00:42.041
Now, you tell me you got Boyd and Quarles
all wrapped up in a pretty little bow.

00:42.126 --> 00:43.751
Fantastic.
In the meantime,

00:43.836 --> 00:47.672
not a day passes federal boots
aren't on the ground in Nobles Holler,

00:47.756 --> 00:49.340
until I get what I want.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.883
What in the hell you doing here?

00:50.968 --> 00:52.552
Coming out slowly.

00:52.636 --> 00:53.886
Now.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.767
Drop your weapon, or I will shoot.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.313
- Tom.
- Quarles did it. Quarles shot him.

01:16.827 --> 01:20.621
I've had troopers canvassing the whole town.
And so far, no reports of the suspect.

01:21.457 --> 01:24.834
We've got our best trackers coming in,
with K-9 and air support.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.128
Daylight comes, we'll find Quarles.

01:29.465 --> 01:30.548
How is he?

01:31.049 --> 01:32.383
He didn't make it.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.178
Jesus Christ.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.138
I'm sorry, Captain.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.390
Chief Deputy Art Mullen.

01:39.850 --> 01:44.020
He coded. They kept working his heart.
Took him directly into surgery, but...

01:45.606 --> 01:47.190
He conscious on the drive over?

01:49.151 --> 01:52.945
He didn't confirm it was Quarles
who shot him, if that's what you're thinking.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.531
I'm guessing this Quarles hasn't been found,

01:56.241 --> 01:57.658
or I would have heard it on the radio.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.453
Our Fugitive Task Force
is on its way over here.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.372
Crowder's awake.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.548
- Then what happened?
- Well, I don't know,

02:12.633 --> 02:15.092
because I was unconscious at the time.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.428
I already told you.
It was Quarles that shot the trooper.

02:17.513 --> 02:18.971
Shut up, Johnny. He ain't talking to you.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.641
Look, Raylan. You want to talk to me,
you gonna have to stand in line.

02:21.725 --> 02:23.643
It seems like I'm the most popular
man in this room tonight.

02:23.727 --> 02:27.188
If it's all the same to all concerned, I thought
I might just jump to the front of the line.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.731
I'm pretty much done.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.233
Raylan.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.903
Raylan, I hope you have enough respect

02:33.987 --> 02:37.156
for my capabilities to know
that I would not blow up a car

02:37.241 --> 02:39.283
- that I'm standing next to.
- Who, then?

02:40.869 --> 02:43.579
Wynn Duffy.
Does that name mean anything to you?

02:43.914 --> 02:46.582
- Put a BOLO out.
- Large RV, registered to Wynn Duffy Security.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.918
I'm looking for Boyd and Johnny.
You let me in.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.670
Hey, Givens.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.547
It's all right. Let him in.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.467
What the hell you doing here?

02:56.552 --> 02:58.719
I heard that a cop in a hat got shot.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.263
Guess it wasn't you.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.889
No. I'm fine.

03:01.974 --> 03:03.349
I can see that.

03:05.644 --> 03:08.896
Am I done here? I got a family member
that's concerned about me.

03:09.648 --> 03:12.650
- We're done.
- I want to talk to you.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.446
Wondered what the hell happened to you.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.073
Yeah?

03:20.325 --> 03:22.201
That's funny. I wanted to ask you
the same question.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.662
You pulled a gun on Ava.
You stick her in the cellar.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.540
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Wasn't my idea. I had to do it.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.042
- To shut her up.
- To shut who up? Ava?

03:30.127 --> 03:32.879
No, no. Not Ava. I just...

03:33.672 --> 03:35.673
Something had to be done, and I did it.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.216
You haven't been taking your medication,
have you?

03:37.301 --> 03:39.427
- I've been trying, but...
- Sit down.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.053
She hides them where I can't find them.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.556
- Who? Helen?
- That's right.

03:43.640 --> 03:47.018
Thinks it's funny,
watch an old man chase around his pills.

03:47.269 --> 03:50.146
I took care of business.
That's all you need to know.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.691
I want you to take one of these pills.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.736
In front of me. Go on.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.882
Hey, Marshal. That your guy over there?

04:18.966 --> 04:20.551
I appreciate this.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.553
What are they doing?

04:23.055 --> 04:26.307
I just need five minutes with the one, Duffy.

04:33.982 --> 04:34.982
Let's go.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.485
Why don't we just start
with you telling me what you know?

04:39.154 --> 04:41.113
Was it Quarles? Where is he?

04:42.699 --> 04:44.533
You blew up the car.
You must have been close.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.243
Did you see who killed the trooper?

04:46.662 --> 04:48.704
You don't want to tell me,
I'll just assume it was you.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.875
- What do you know?
- What do I...

04:54.086 --> 04:56.128
What I know is, we were on our way...

04:56.213 --> 04:58.881
Mike and I were on our way
to midnight mass,

04:58.966 --> 05:01.300
and apparently,
we were exceeding the speed limit,

05:01.385 --> 05:03.010
because these gentlemen pulled us over.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.428
Yeah, and they pulled this off of you.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.555
I have a permit for that in my other pants.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.725
You remember the pawn shop owner
you sent after me?

05:09.851 --> 05:11.143
Glen Fogle?

05:11.228 --> 05:12.311
God rest his soul.

05:12.396 --> 05:16.315
Had a little game he liked to play
with his flunkies. Are you familiar?

05:19.069 --> 05:21.570
- Remind me.
- I ask you a question.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.614
You answer truthfully,

05:23.699 --> 05:25.199
or I pull the trigger.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.742
You understand?

05:27.077 --> 05:28.452
It seems simple enough.

05:28.537 --> 05:29.704
You have any questions?

05:31.164 --> 05:33.249
- What are you doing?
- Is that your question?

05:35.794 --> 05:37.420
You think you can make me talk?

05:37.504 --> 05:40.172
- That's your choice.
- Or you're gonna shoot me?

05:40.257 --> 05:42.717
There's a five out of six chance I won't.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.177
- Bullshit.
- Where's Quarles?

05:45.262 --> 05:47.346
- Kiss my ass.
- Jesus!

05:47.431 --> 05:48.681
Christ!

05:48.765 --> 05:50.224
There are cops outside!

05:50.308 --> 05:52.184
- That's right. They're outside.
- You're a cop!

05:52.269 --> 05:53.519
Deputy US Marshal.

05:53.603 --> 05:57.648
Raylan, you just can't come in here and
shoot me because you feel like it!

05:57.733 --> 05:58.941
Why not?

05:59.276 --> 06:01.360
Isn't that the way you guys do it?

06:01.445 --> 06:03.320
Isn't that why Tom Bergen's dead,

06:03.405 --> 06:05.740
why his wife and children are grieving?

06:05.824 --> 06:07.033
So, you know what?

06:07.117 --> 06:08.784
- Now we're gonna play by your rules.
- Raylan.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.536
- Where's Quarles?
- I don't know!

06:10.620 --> 06:12.163
Jesus! Stop it!

06:13.081 --> 06:15.708
- What is wrong with you?
- You want me to stop?

06:16.084 --> 06:18.044
- Tell me the truth.
- How can I tell you what I don't know?

06:18.128 --> 06:20.629
Start with telling me what you do know.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.214
Okay. Just give me a minute.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.300
- No.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

06:25.177 --> 06:27.720
Okay! What do I know?
What do I know? I know that...

06:30.891 --> 06:33.142
I know that Limehouse set this all up!

06:33.310 --> 06:34.518
I know that Quarles likes young boys.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.812
Who do you think called in
the Brady Hughes tip? Me!

06:36.897 --> 06:40.232
I know that he wants you dead,
and he probably wants me dead, too.

06:40.317 --> 06:43.778
And, yes, I tried to blow him up in his car!

06:43.862 --> 06:46.238
And then I drove away! That's what I know!

06:46.323 --> 06:47.406
That's it?

06:47.491 --> 06:48.574
That is all I know!

06:48.658 --> 06:51.160
- You don't know where he is?
- I don't know where he is!

06:55.040 --> 06:56.165
Okay.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.669
I believe you.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.050
Jesus Christ!

08:08.780 --> 08:10.239
Well, you invited me here.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.658
Should I be expecting an apology?

08:13.118 --> 08:16.871
I got an idea you were not entirely happy
with my services.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.420
I am returning your deposit.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.381
Duly witnessed.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.427
There's even a little interest in there.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.102
You really think this
concludes our business?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.270
I do.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.774
Now, we can both walk away
with what we got,

08:46.109 --> 08:47.943
or we can have it out right now.

08:49.196 --> 08:53.032
Although you are traveling a little light.
I don't see Devil back there,

08:53.116 --> 08:55.451
gun pointed at me, finger on the trigger.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.333
Well, I guess we best both sleep
with one eye open.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.710
I always do.

09:21.353 --> 09:22.811
Want me to make that call?

09:25.273 --> 09:29.068
Not yet.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.160
You screwed up.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.120
In what manner of speaking?

09:40.205 --> 09:42.331
In a very serious manner.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.500
I'm just trying to catch up here, Marshal.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.379
You trying to say that
your big bust didn't work out?

09:49.172 --> 09:52.925
A horsefly sneezes in these hills,
he knows about it beforehand,

09:53.009 --> 09:57.513
but I'm to believe the car bomb and the
dead trooper down the road comes as news.

09:58.139 --> 10:02.017
Well, now that you say it, I think I did hear
something about something like that.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.978
Like we're talking about the weather.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.188
What is tomorrow's weather forecast?

10:06.523 --> 10:08.565
I reckon it's gonna be a beautiful day.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.151
You are gonna spend it indoors.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.322
Charged with accessory to murder.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.950
- Now, hold on just a minute.
- You promised me Boyd.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.161
You promised me Quarles,
and what I got was a dead cop.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.789
I don't recall promising you donkey squat.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.375
I just pointed out an opportunity, more like.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.627
- Oh, is that right?
- That's right.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.171
And what I'm hearing,
sounded like you screwed up.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.465
- Excuse me?
- You screwed up.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.675
You know how I know that?

10:34.759 --> 10:36.302
'Cause one of yours is dead.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.180
Think twice about your next move,
gentlemen.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.686
- Mr. Givens?
- Deputy Marshal.

10:46.354 --> 10:49.064
I ain't my father,
and I don't care to be confused with him.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.152
I don't think you seeing
the big picture 'round here, Marshal.

11:08.710 --> 11:12.004
Now, you boys know how to
get rid of blood and bones.

11:12.756 --> 11:16.467
He shoots, you make sure nobody finds him.
None of him.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.304
I want what you promised me.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.311
I don't know if I can get you Quarles.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.688
But I might could get you Boyd Crowder.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.654
I'm listening.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.699
Come on. Come on.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.869
All the way to the hilltop up there.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.832
<i>Be on the lookout for Robert Quarles.</i>

11:48.917 --> 11:53.212
<i>Suspect is a white male, 5'11",
180 pounds, blond hair, blue eyes.</i>

11:53.713 --> 11:56.090
<i>Officers advised to
approach with extreme caution,</i>

11:56.216 --> 11:58.133
<i>as suspect is armed and dangerous.</i>

12:03.390 --> 12:04.390
Clear.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.891
Come on. Come on.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.148
That helicopter again.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.902
Hey, I told y'all I heard something explode
last night. You didn't believe me, though.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.570
Night before that,
you were telling us you heard a bear.

12:18.655 --> 12:21.532
Oh, yeah, and just how do you know
it wasn't a bear, pudknocker?

12:22.575 --> 12:24.910
Hey. I don't like that kind of talk.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.079
Gosh. Can't believe I slept through all that.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.747
Mom, you don't sleep. You hibernate.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.917
Oh, funny. Hey, you dropped something.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.003
Nice.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.548
I get bit by a copperhead, it's on you.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.884
Maybe I'll get eaten by that bear Mitch heard.
How would that be?

12:49.185 --> 12:50.227
Mom?

12:57.193 --> 12:59.862
I'm guessing you got the keys, sport.

13:04.993 --> 13:08.454
Shelby, my friend.
To what do we owe the honor?

13:08.538 --> 13:11.373
- We need to talk, you and me.
- That sounds ominous.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.584
You only been on the job one day.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.544
You're already calling in an official capacity?

13:15.837 --> 13:17.796
Not exactly. You alone?

13:18.756 --> 13:20.048
Well, I can be.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.384
- What is it?
- I don't know.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.512
All right, Shelby. You got me alone.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.473
Well, it's not good.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.267
Well, let's hear it.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.394
A warrant popped.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.229
I made a couple of calls.

13:34.606 --> 13:35.689
Best I could find out,

13:35.773 --> 13:38.942
the US Marshals believe you put a body
in the ground some nights past.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.778
Where was I supposed to have done this?

13:41.863 --> 13:43.238
Out by Black Lick Creek.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.286
Anything else?

13:49.579 --> 13:52.080
They're watching your house.
That's why I didn't come in person.

13:52.624 --> 13:56.001
They didn't call in my office.
They just called the state troopers.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.003
<i>On account of our relationship.</i>

13:58.922 --> 14:02.925
Well, where do things stand, Shelby?

14:04.302 --> 14:06.637
Well, they're gonna pick you up
if they find the body.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.434
How much time I got?

14:12.810 --> 14:14.603
They're still digging, last I heard.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.772
Half hour. Less.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.107
<i>Listen, Boyd.</i>

14:19.817 --> 14:21.318
You saved my life,

14:21.569 --> 14:24.821
and then you pulled me off the
ash heap, gave me a second chance.

14:25.615 --> 14:28.534
But now, I believe we're square.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.244
Good luck.

14:41.839 --> 14:44.633
"Trust Jesus."

14:48.513 --> 14:49.805
So.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.267
You folks on vacation?

14:54.435 --> 14:55.852
We were at a rock festival.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.188
Christian rock.

14:58.273 --> 14:59.565
I like that.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.608
Good place to bond over.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.320
What's your name, son?

15:06.447 --> 15:07.573
- Pete.
- Pete.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.367
- Your brother's name?
- He's Mitch.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.037
You don't say much, Mitch, do you?

15:15.498 --> 15:16.832
That's okay. I get it.

15:19.794 --> 15:22.671
Look, you boys are lucky.
You get to spend time with your mom.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.258
I didn't get to spend much time with mine.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.469
She died when I was pretty young.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.472
Speaking of which, where's Dad?

15:34.726 --> 15:36.226
We're divorced.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.272
Ma'am, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna borrow your phone.

15:40.356 --> 15:44.526
I need to make a call. Now, Pete,
don't do anything stupid, 'cause remember,

15:45.361 --> 15:48.739
I've got a gun pressed to your mother's back.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.284
Put Theo on the phone.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.077
Put him on the phone!

16:03.713 --> 16:04.921
Bobby Quarles.

16:06.549 --> 16:07.883
You're shitting me.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.721
Bobby. What a surprise.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.264
Oh, hi, Theo.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.934
I guess it wasn't my time yet.
Somebody upstairs likes me.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.062
Oh, that's a great movie.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.522
One of Newman's finest performances.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.733
You know, just thinking about it
makes me want to watch it again.

16:24.817 --> 16:28.236
Lanny, do me a favor. Go get my copy of
<i>Somebody Up There Likes Me.</i>

16:28.321 --> 16:30.405
<i>- It should be in with the classics.</i>
- Theo.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.574
Theo!

16:35.411 --> 16:36.787
Okay. I'm back.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.789
Theo, I want to come home.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.374
You want to come home?

16:40.708 --> 16:42.959
Yes. Name the price.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.170
Home. Hold on.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.963
Hey, Lanny. Lanny, forget about it.

16:47.048 --> 16:49.758
It's not here. It's at home, in Detroit.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.427
- What?
- I'm sorry, Bobby.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.596
I'm at the California house.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.849
Okay, so, here's the deal.

16:58.893 --> 17:00.811
You owe me $250,000.

17:01.312 --> 17:03.855
<i>- I'm gonna need that paid back in full.</i>
- Okay.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.483
And Sammy's gonna need something
for pain and suffering.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.068
Pain and suffering?

17:08.236 --> 17:11.070
You pointed a gun in his face, Bobby.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.823
<i>Actions have consequences.</i>

17:13.199 --> 17:14.616
Okay. How much?

17:15.785 --> 17:17.828
- Double it.
- That's $500,000.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.204
<i>That'll get you home.</i>

17:19.288 --> 17:20.329
That's a lot of money, Theo.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.957
Well, you're lucky it's not more.
You know why?

17:22.040 --> 17:25.752
- No, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me why.
<i>- You disgust me, Bobby.</i>

17:26.295 --> 17:27.462
What you've become.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.882
I don't want you part of the outfit anymore.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.135
I'll let you get things
straight with your family.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.178
You come up with the money,
you can come home.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.013
I will come up with the money.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.022
What was Shelby calling about?

17:47.150 --> 17:49.234
State troopers are digging up Devil.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.697
- What?
- Said I was the one who put him there.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.824
Was there a witness?

17:56.576 --> 17:57.951
Wasn't any witness.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.745
This come from Limehouse.

18:00.455 --> 18:01.788
Well, now, how the hell
would you know that?

18:01.873 --> 18:04.040
Last night on the bridge,

18:05.168 --> 18:07.502
he asked where Devil was just so I'd know.

18:08.463 --> 18:09.755
Well, he couldn't have known.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.090
He could if somebody told him.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.052
Only people know anything about that
are in this room.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.429
Well, it wasn't me.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.433
And I know it wasn't Ava.

18:26.689 --> 18:28.356
You can go to hell, Boyd.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.401
I'm the one that tipped you off to Devil
in the first place.

18:35.323 --> 18:36.740
Arlo, what about you?

18:38.367 --> 18:40.076
You said anything to anybody

18:41.245 --> 18:42.871
about anything?

18:44.165 --> 18:45.457
No.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.042
Nothing, Boyd.

18:48.211 --> 18:49.711
Unless...

18:50.797 --> 18:53.381
- Unless what?
- Not sure.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.635
Might have said something to Helen.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.679
Women don't know how to keep a secret.

19:00.723 --> 19:01.973
Holy shit.

19:02.725 --> 19:03.975
Arlo.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.895
- I'm sure I didn't.
- Except you're not sure.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.355
What the hell we gonna do?

19:09.524 --> 19:12.192
Okay, wait. What were they looking for?

19:12.401 --> 19:14.027
What evidence can we get rid of?

19:14.111 --> 19:16.404
Honey, there's a Kentucky State Police

19:16.489 --> 19:19.908
and a US Marshal sitting in their car
at the end of this driveway.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.661
Now, we light out of here,
start trying to hide evidence,

19:22.745 --> 19:24.704
we're just as likely to lead them to it.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.458
- There's got to be something that we can do!
- Johnny, you watch Arlo.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.544
Come on.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.715
Boyd, please.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.009
You can't just sit here. You got to run.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.761
There ain't nowhere for me to go.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.558
They would always know that
I would come back to you.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.019
It's not how it's supposed to happen,

19:48.104 --> 19:49.646
without no warning.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.316
We need more time. I want more time.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.652
Now, we didn't invent the rules, baby.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.071
We just got to play by them.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.866
Now.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.584
All right, Pete. Pull up over here. Right here.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.545
That's it. Nice and easy. Good boy.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.715
Nice and easy. Good boy.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.259
All right, Mom. What do you say we get out
and stretch our legs?

20:19.510 --> 20:20.802
I'm fine.

20:21.512 --> 20:22.804
Get out.

20:24.599 --> 20:27.893
I'm getting out. Just don't...
Point the gun at me, not them, okay?

20:29.687 --> 20:32.647
- Go.
- No! No! No! No!

20:32.732 --> 20:34.566
- Pete, I'm not gonna say it again.
- No, don't do this.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.109
- Go!
- Take me! Leave them!

20:36.193 --> 20:37.736
Come on.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.279
Pete, stop the car!

20:40.656 --> 20:42.407
- Mom!
- It's gonna be okay, Mitch.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.160
Stop the car, Pete! Mom!

20:46.329 --> 20:49.706
Did I tell you boys I have a son of my own?
Yeah. He's about your age.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.089
Boyd, they're here.

21:00.009 --> 21:02.510
Arlo, you mind letting them in?

21:10.353 --> 21:12.395
Sorry we didn't call first.

21:12.480 --> 21:17.651
Boyd Crowder, you are under arrest for the
murder of one Derrick Lennox, AKA Devil.

21:17.735 --> 21:18.985
You have the right to remain silent.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.987
I'll assert that right
and the one about the lawyer.

21:21.072 --> 21:22.113
Fair enough.

21:22.198 --> 21:23.865
You mind telling me
how you turned this thing federal?

21:23.950 --> 21:26.284
State police invited us
to be part of a task force,

21:26.369 --> 21:28.745
due to local law-enforcement
corruption and the like.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.205
You process me through Lexington,

21:30.289 --> 21:34.042
you show the whole world there's no way
Deputy Givens and I could be in cahoots.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.252
You're not as dumb as you look.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.631
I like the use of the word cahoots, though.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.848
Raylan, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.434
Sorry for what?

21:51.519 --> 21:53.895
How I treated you when you were a boy.

21:54.355 --> 21:55.313
Okay.

21:55.398 --> 21:57.315
Not an easy thing for me to say.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.985
- No, I figured not.
- But she insisted.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.778
I know she was your favorite.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.948
Gave you Ale-8s and MoonPies,

22:05.408 --> 22:08.034
let you watch TV till your eyes rotted out.

22:08.119 --> 22:10.328
But you don't know how she can nag.

22:10.413 --> 22:11.746
You talking to Helen again?

22:11.831 --> 22:13.581
She does all the talking.

22:14.667 --> 22:18.086
Raylan, woman just flagged down
a KSP trooper.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.005
Said that she and her two boys
had been carjacked

22:20.089 --> 22:21.965
by a man that fits Quarles' description.

22:25.261 --> 22:26.428
Thanks, Arlo.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.028
Johnny!

22:46.949 --> 22:48.074
Yeah?

22:49.660 --> 22:51.077
We're gonna figure this out.

22:51.746 --> 22:52.912
Who is?

22:53.164 --> 22:55.540
- We are. You and me.
- Okay.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.668
First off, someone's gonna pay.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.295
Damn straight.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.255
You got any ideas?

23:02.339 --> 23:04.007
I say we start with Ellen May.

23:04.467 --> 23:05.800
Ellen May?

23:05.926 --> 23:09.012
Yeah. You don't know? Dickie Bennett,
he was in there to see her just yesterday.

23:09.513 --> 23:10.764
Dickie Bennett?

23:10.848 --> 23:13.224
That's what the girls told me.
He was in there,

23:13.309 --> 23:16.311
pressing her for information,
and you know how those girls talk, Ava.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.104
That place is turning into a sieve.

23:18.189 --> 23:21.399
Even if that's true, Ellen May don't know shit.

23:21.484 --> 23:23.026
She knows Arlo.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.072
- Did he tell you who he called?
- No.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.615
Was he talking to a man or a woman?

23:28.699 --> 23:30.867
- Man's voice. It was kind of loud.
- Did they argue?

23:30.951 --> 23:33.411
- No. Theo. I think he said Theo.
- Theo Tonin.

23:33.496 --> 23:35.330
He said he wanted to come home.

23:35.581 --> 23:36.831
He said he wanted to come home?

23:36.916 --> 23:40.502
Yes. He said, "Name your price,"
and the man said, "$500,000."

23:41.629 --> 23:43.254
Ms. Jenson, Deputy Brooks
is gonna take you

23:43.339 --> 23:45.256
to see the folks at victim services, all right?

23:45.341 --> 23:47.300
Yes, but listen to me.
Please, you have to know.

23:47.384 --> 23:48.927
This is the only family that I have.

23:49.011 --> 23:51.262
We are going to find your boys, Ms. Jenson.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.098
- Home is Detroit, right?
- Yes, it is.

23:53.182 --> 23:56.059
And with her boy driving, he's probably
blown through the roadblocks already.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.645
Boys, we need to pull up stakes here
and shift everything north!

23:58.729 --> 24:01.356
Tim, call Air Ops.
Tell them we're widening the search.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.691
- Art. He said he needed money.
- What?

24:03.776 --> 24:04.818
Yeah. $500,000.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.653
He ain't got that kind of money.

24:06.737 --> 24:09.072
Well, maybe he's gonna rob liquor stores
on his way to Michigan.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.615
I need every file you've got on him.

24:10.699 --> 24:11.950
That means go back to the office.

24:12.034 --> 24:13.118
- Yes, it does.
- Art!

24:13.202 --> 24:14.911
Not now, Raylan! Just do it!

24:26.215 --> 24:28.007
- Givens.
<i>- Marshal?</i>

24:28.092 --> 24:30.385
- Yeah. Who's this?
<i>- This is Mitch.</i>

24:30.845 --> 24:34.681
Mr. Quarles says to do exactly
what I say or he'll kill me.

24:36.058 --> 24:37.225
Okay.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.561
<i>Now get in your car.</i>

24:40.563 --> 24:41.896
Put your phone on speaker.

24:42.106 --> 24:45.483
- Put your phone on speaker.
- And set it on the seat next to you.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.277
And set it on the seat next to you.

24:47.361 --> 24:52.824
<i>If you talk to anyone or do anything stupid...</i>

24:52.950 --> 24:54.242
I will kill you.

24:57.830 --> 24:58.955
<i>He'll kill me.</i>

25:26.984 --> 25:27.984
Come on.

25:30.112 --> 25:31.237
Mr. Quarles.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.282
Looking a little worse for wear, there.

25:35.034 --> 25:38.786
Well, I didn't have a chance to pretty myself
up for you there, Raylan.

25:39.747 --> 25:42.457
You don't by chance
have an ibuprofen on you, would you?

25:43.042 --> 25:44.876
No? Okay.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.711
I'll just have your gun
and your phone, please.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.379
The way this works is

25:48.464 --> 25:50.965
you give up these boys, I give you my gun.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.969
How about you give me the gun
and I don't kill the boys?

25:55.137 --> 25:56.930
Boys for my gun.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.556
That's cute.

25:58.641 --> 26:03.311
Now drop your gun and
your phone and take five steps back.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.104
Now.

26:06.357 --> 26:07.774
Attaboy.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.907
Mitch, go pick it up.

26:16.659 --> 26:17.992
Go ahead, son.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.163
Now get in the van.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.042
Move!

26:28.837 --> 26:30.713
Just so we're clear, I'm gonna want that back.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.006
Is that so?

26:32.299 --> 26:33.841
Wait a second.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.388
This one?

26:38.472 --> 26:39.639
That one you can keep.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.432
Well, thank you very much.

26:42.685 --> 26:44.352
Let's get my money.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.619
Boy, you work like you eat.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.372
Yeah, you don't leave nothing undone.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.291
Just how I do things.

27:06.750 --> 27:07.917
And I appreciate that.

27:08.836 --> 27:11.212
Now, I need to have a word with Errol.

27:13.007 --> 27:14.507
How about if I take this home?

27:15.843 --> 27:17.051
How'd that be?

27:28.814 --> 27:31.065
You are one of the few folk 'round here

27:31.608 --> 27:33.401
that's got a thing for pig tongue.

27:33.569 --> 27:34.736
Yes, sir.

27:36.113 --> 27:38.239
Yeah, I dress it up in mustard seed,

27:39.241 --> 27:41.659
soak it in cider to sweeten the taste.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.996
Then I put a little vinegar
just to soften the texture,

27:45.080 --> 27:47.582
and it just sits right there, just sits.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.043
Till you come 'round.

27:50.252 --> 27:52.503
You used to send plates
home to me when I was a boy.

27:52.588 --> 27:53.755
That's right.

27:55.132 --> 27:58.343
Your daddy would set it aside
when we butchered together.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.555
Yep. End of the day, "Lime!"

28:03.515 --> 28:05.058
Your daddy called me "Lime."

28:06.643 --> 28:09.896
"You want to fix some of this here up
so I can take it home to little Errol?"

28:10.606 --> 28:11.981
I'd fix it up, too.

28:13.442 --> 28:14.692
Yeah.

28:15.611 --> 28:17.403
I don't know what I'm gonna do

28:17.488 --> 28:20.740
once you are gone,
I guess I'll take it off the menu.

28:22.159 --> 28:23.368
Sir?

28:23.994 --> 28:26.788
Well, Boyd Crowder, he's in jail,

28:27.664 --> 28:30.124
and Mr. Quarles is on the run.

28:30.292 --> 28:32.627
Every lawman in Kentucky's hunting him.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.004
Yes, sir.

28:35.506 --> 28:36.964
My work is done.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.717
And now we are done.

28:40.677 --> 28:41.928
You and me.

28:43.013 --> 28:46.099
- Mr. Limehouse...
- I want you to pack your things,

28:46.392 --> 28:49.185
and you get out of Nobles Holler before dark.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.271
But why?

29:23.512 --> 29:26.180
- Yeah.
<i>- What in the hell were you thinking?</i>

29:26.765 --> 29:29.809
You gonna have to be more specific.
I got a lot on my plate right now.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.144
Calling in about Devil.

29:31.228 --> 29:33.312
Boyd goddamn nearly figured out
where that came from.

29:33.397 --> 29:34.689
But he didn't, did he?

29:34.773 --> 29:37.942
Because I got lucky.
I laid it off on Arlo and one of Ava's girls.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.444
Well, maybe it was luck.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.612
Maybe it was providence.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.573
Now, you been wanting
Boyd Crowder out the way

29:43.657 --> 29:45.783
ever since he got you gutshot.

29:46.535 --> 29:47.952
<i>Now it's done.</i>

29:49.872 --> 29:51.247
Yeah, maybe.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.459
But you and me, we are not done.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.263
- Enjoy it all you can.
- Come on. Yeah!

30:07.347 --> 30:08.973
Yeah!

30:09.057 --> 30:10.224
You like that.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.435
What the hell?

30:13.187 --> 30:15.313
I'm gonna need you to get out. Now!

30:15.397 --> 30:16.731
What did I do?

30:16.815 --> 30:19.150
- Would you get out of here?
- I already paid her!

30:19.568 --> 30:21.652
- I got your money, okay?
- Ellen May.

30:22.404 --> 30:23.946
What you doing talking to Dickie Bennett?

30:24.031 --> 30:25.823
- What do you mean? Hey, I got you!
- She still owes me.

30:25.908 --> 30:27.074
Sweetheart.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.327
I know he was here.
Now, what I want is the truth.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.996
- Only for a few minutes.
- What did he want?

30:32.080 --> 30:33.789
To talk about Limehouse.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.502
- Have you seen my scar?
- Of course.

30:37.586 --> 30:39.629
That man stood in my kitchen!

30:39.713 --> 30:41.130
He shot me in my chest!

30:41.215 --> 30:44.133
I know. I told him he shouldn't be here,
but he just wouldn't listen.

30:44.218 --> 30:45.426
No!

30:47.012 --> 30:48.137
What did you tell him?

30:48.263 --> 30:52.767
Just to talk about Limehouse and find out
where he put his money under the church.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.310
What did you say about Devil?

30:55.270 --> 30:57.563
Devil? I didn't...
I didn't say anything about Devil.

30:57.648 --> 30:59.398
You told Dickie something
he took back to Limehouse.

30:59.483 --> 31:01.359
- No! No!
- Arlo told you something!

31:01.443 --> 31:03.027
You've been working
with Limehouse himself!

31:03.111 --> 31:04.529
- I don't know!
- I've been loyal!

31:04.613 --> 31:05.821
To who?

31:08.242 --> 31:11.786
Look, if I wanted to do wrong by you,
there are things I could say.

31:15.082 --> 31:16.332
You don't threaten me.

31:19.628 --> 31:21.045
And you don't talk to anybody
about anything!

31:21.129 --> 31:23.881
I'm sorry.

31:46.697 --> 31:48.447
Right up here. Easy, easy, easy.

31:50.534 --> 31:53.035
That's it. Stop right there.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.830
Now, take your cuffs

31:55.998 --> 31:58.666
and cuff Pete to the steering wheel. Good.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.668
Mitch, come on.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.254
Hands up, Raylan. Let's go.

32:05.632 --> 32:06.882
Out. Come.

32:12.014 --> 32:13.514
Mr. Limehouse!

32:13.599 --> 32:15.558
Get in there. Move.

32:18.770 --> 32:19.895
Marshal.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.940
- And company.
- Things didn't go as planned,

32:23.025 --> 32:25.651
- or at least not as discussed.
- Stopped by for a favor.

32:26.028 --> 32:27.361
A favor?

32:27.696 --> 32:29.697
You done lost your damn mind.

32:29.990 --> 32:33.451
Mr. Quarles decided
he wants to go home now.

32:33.702 --> 32:34.702
I want to go home.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.121
Well, is there something I can do
to help speed you on your way?

32:37.205 --> 32:38.789
He needs a little traveling money.

32:40.417 --> 32:41.500
How much?

32:42.711 --> 32:43.961
A half million.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.339
Then we'll get out of your hair.

32:46.548 --> 32:48.883
A half million ain't
getting-out-your-hair money.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.384
That's fighting money.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.055
- What kind of collateral you got?
- You're looking at it.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.515
Oh, so I pay or you kill the marshal?

32:56.600 --> 32:59.435
Yeah. Well, no. First, I'll kill the kid,
and then I will kill the marshal.

32:59.561 --> 33:02.647
Well, no offense, but
not my people, not my problem.

33:02.731 --> 33:03.814
Well, then I'm gonna kill you.

33:03.899 --> 33:07.485
You do, there'll be a dozen armed men
out there before you can turn around,

33:07.569 --> 33:10.321
- as the marshal can attest.
- I can.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.157
Yes, but then you would be dead.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.285
Okay, then.

33:16.536 --> 33:19.246
So, we all know where we stand, don't we?

33:24.294 --> 33:25.336
Okay. Look.

33:25.420 --> 33:28.589
Ellstin, you been saying
you just want to be left alone.

33:30.676 --> 33:33.386
Well, I figure this gets it done.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.765
Come on, Ellstin. You can do it.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.611
Steady. I've got the gun.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.341
Oh, shit, it's a piggy bank!

34:15.303 --> 34:18.097
Son, grab that bucket and fill it up.

34:23.937 --> 34:26.313
Marshal, you are
one strange piece of chicken.

34:26.982 --> 34:30.650
One day, you about to tear
my whole world apart over a dead trooper.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.279
Next day, you giving all this money
to the man that killed him.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.406
Wait.

34:35.489 --> 34:37.783
Wait a second.
You think that I killed the trooper?

34:40.661 --> 34:41.996
Who did?

35:16.823 --> 35:17.990
Who killed him?

35:25.081 --> 35:27.666
Your old man.

35:40.013 --> 35:41.347
Arlo. Hey.

35:41.431 --> 35:43.390
Let's go. Hey. Wake up.

35:45.101 --> 35:47.770
- Wake up.
- What's the matter?

35:48.313 --> 35:50.439
Let's go. Come on.

35:50.524 --> 35:51.816
Is that you, son?

35:51.900 --> 35:53.567
You got clothes on under there?

35:54.027 --> 35:55.903
- I don't know.
- Come on. Get up.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.197
Let's get you dressed.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.408
What's going on?

36:14.297 --> 36:15.506
Raylan.

36:16.091 --> 36:17.842
They're gonna take you
in the conference room, Arlo.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.176
Not like I got a choice.

36:19.261 --> 36:20.928
I'll be there momentarily.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.930
Thought you might be interested.

36:23.056 --> 36:24.974
One of the weapons
that you pulled off of Quarles

36:25.058 --> 36:27.768
turned out to be a match for the gun
that killed Gary Hawkins.

36:28.478 --> 36:29.812
That's nice.

36:30.438 --> 36:33.190
- You don't sound very surprised.
- Kind of had a hunch.

36:34.067 --> 36:35.359
Are you okay?

36:36.152 --> 36:37.444
Could use a little sleep.

36:37.946 --> 36:39.780
Well, we'll handle the interview.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.700
Public defender's already here.
Why don't you go home?

36:49.624 --> 36:51.333
Think it's true, what they say?

36:52.085 --> 36:53.544
Well, what do they say?

36:53.628 --> 36:55.629
One bad apple spoils the barrel.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.507
Well, Raylan, even in a little town like Harlan,

36:58.592 --> 37:01.468
I think the apple barrel is obsolete.

37:01.595 --> 37:05.014
But the expression ain't,
'cause of the truth contained therein.

37:05.098 --> 37:07.433
You trying to tell me
we ain't talking about apples?

37:09.311 --> 37:12.396
- What's Arlo doing here?
- Likely killed Tom Bergen.

37:13.356 --> 37:16.609
- Who told you that?
- Don't matter. He doesn't deny it.

37:16.693 --> 37:20.571
Since he's part of your crew,
shouldn't be too tough to tie you into it.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.364
Add that to whatever
you're gonna get for Devil,

37:22.449 --> 37:25.618
and I don't suppose
I'll be seeing you again in 20 years.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.162
That's the apple, the barrel, and the tree.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.081
I've connected to Arlo

37:32.250 --> 37:35.586
in ways I was never given a chance to do
with my own daddy.

37:37.839 --> 37:39.298
He's not my crew, Raylan.

37:39.758 --> 37:40.841
He's my family.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.054
So long, Boyd.

37:46.014 --> 37:47.139
We're just talking.

37:47.223 --> 37:48.766
Well, we shouldn't be talking.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.143
Based on the reports,
he's clearly non compos mentis.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.519
Are you saying I'm crazy?

37:52.604 --> 37:55.689
- That's not what I'm saying.
- I'm not crazy. I know what I done.

37:55.815 --> 37:57.733
- What did you do?
- Don't answer that question, Mr. Givens.

37:57.817 --> 38:01.111
First off, I killed that state trooper,
like you said.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.613
- Tom Bergen.
- That's right.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.114
- Mr. Givens, don't...
- Why?

38:04.199 --> 38:05.908
I did it to protect Boyd.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.701
Same reason I killed Devil.

38:12.207 --> 38:13.290
Same reason you did what?

38:13.375 --> 38:15.626
- I killed Devil.
- We are done here, Art. Now...

38:15.710 --> 38:19.254
He was ready to take Boyd out,
and I took him out first.

38:19.339 --> 38:21.215
- So, you killed Devil?
- That's right.

38:22.050 --> 38:24.051
I can show you where they found the body.

38:24.135 --> 38:27.137
I can even take you to the gun, if you want.

38:28.139 --> 38:31.016
- Why did you do it?
- I did it to protect Boyd.

38:31.101 --> 38:33.102
First, I killed Devil.

38:33.228 --> 38:34.603
Then I killed the trooper.

38:40.068 --> 38:43.529
<i>I guess Art thought what Arlo had done
upset me in some way.</i>

38:44.364 --> 38:46.407
<i>Could really only be expected.</i>

38:46.491 --> 38:49.326
<i>Arlo's a criminal. Never been anything else.</i>

38:50.161 --> 38:51.662
<i>Art offered me a drink.</i>

38:52.080 --> 38:54.415
<i>I didn't need it, but took it anyway.</i>

38:55.792 --> 38:57.668
<i>Then Boyd got his release.</i>

38:58.294 --> 39:03.007
<i>I asked if he was proud,
letting a feeble old man take the fall for him.</i>

39:04.426 --> 39:06.969
<i>Didn't seem to bother him none
one way or the other.</i>

39:08.096 --> 39:12.057
<i>He just walked out of there,
happy as a preacher on Sunday.</i>

39:13.393 --> 39:16.437
So, then you came here,
asking for another drink you don't need.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.522
Are you sure all your sister has is water?

39:18.606 --> 39:20.774
I offered you milk and apple juice.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.776
- Not even light beer?
- Raylan.

39:24.112 --> 39:25.195
Why are you here?

39:25.780 --> 39:27.281
I told you when I came in.

39:28.283 --> 39:31.368
Just wondering how this was
all gonna work out.

39:32.579 --> 39:35.998
So, you gonna stay here with your sister
until the baby's born?

39:38.084 --> 39:39.251
Is that it?

39:40.128 --> 39:43.255
I thought I might pat the belly,
see the latest sonogram.

39:43.339 --> 39:45.466
Tell me a story about a man
getting his arm chopped off.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.843
You know what they're saying at the office?

39:47.969 --> 39:49.470
I "disarmed" him.

39:51.473 --> 39:52.639
Pretty good.

39:58.646 --> 40:00.189
- Yeah.
- Well...

40:00.648 --> 40:03.609
It's getting late,
and I should let you get back to sleep.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.240
- Apologize to your sister for me.
- I will.

40:10.992 --> 40:12.242
Hey, Raylan.

40:14.704 --> 40:16.497
Only thing I don't understand,

40:16.790 --> 40:18.999
why did Art think you'd be upset?

40:19.125 --> 40:21.418
I think it was why Arlo shot Bergen.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.962
- Which was?
- He didn't know he was a state trooper.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.966
Just saw a man in a hat,
pointing a gun at Boyd.

40:29.677 --> 40:30.761
Man in a hat?

40:33.014 --> 40:34.348
Yeah.
