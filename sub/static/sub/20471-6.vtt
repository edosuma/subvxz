WEBVTT

00:00.602 --> 00:04.242
I'm in love. She's married.

00:06.475 --> 00:08.216
They're in the process of divorcing.

00:08.242 --> 00:11.221
But since I can't marry
a divorcee, it makes no odds.

00:12.922 --> 00:18.202
The Church sees the love
I have for her as shameful,

00:18.702 --> 00:20.014
as wrong.

00:21.286 --> 00:25.219
But if God is love, how can it be?

00:25.965 --> 00:29.200
You told me to put duty
above my own needs,

00:29.240 --> 00:30.874
above everything else.

00:31.053 --> 00:35.254
For what? An institution that
cares more about rules

00:35.280 --> 00:36.806
than it does about people?

00:36.960 --> 00:39.256
I can't do it any more.

00:39.834 --> 00:41.259
You've lost your faith.

00:41.285 --> 00:43.445
I have lost my faith in the Church.

00:47.330 --> 00:50.655
When I hear it speak,
I don't hear God any more.

00:53.366 --> 00:55.132
There's nothing I can say, is there?

00:57.217 --> 00:59.137
I will stay until you find
a replacement.

00:59.163 --> 01:01.363
But I would like to tender
my resignation.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.729
Write a letter of notice to the bishop.

01:08.383 --> 01:09.901
Once we receive it...

01:10.836 --> 01:12.316
..you can leave.

01:18.295 --> 01:20.387
I nearly left once.

01:21.246 --> 01:25.340
Then I remembered what's so
beautiful about what we do.

01:25.559 --> 01:29.185
It's the solace we provide
sitting by someone's side.

01:29.375 --> 01:32.983
No words needed. Just being
with them is enough.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.542
Talk to God.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.920
He's the only one who can guide you now.

02:02.125 --> 02:04.211
Morning! Off on an adventure?

02:04.237 --> 02:06.644
- I hope so!
- Be careful.

02:06.670 --> 02:08.669
I hear there are monsters out there.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.440
(Heavy breathing)

02:49.040 --> 02:51.320
- Ohh!
- (Cawing)

02:52.027 --> 02:54.240
Go away! Go away!

02:54.959 --> 02:56.323
Go away!

03:00.058 --> 03:02.532
_

03:11.633 --> 03:14.689
We'll move to London.
You'll get your divorce.

03:14.841 --> 03:16.281
We'll get married.

03:16.461 --> 03:19.261
Or we could just sod the lot
of them and live in sin.

03:19.613 --> 03:21.044
You're certain?

03:23.707 --> 03:26.384
- Yes.
- Bloody hell!

03:27.082 --> 03:28.762
Bloody hell!

03:31.959 --> 03:33.519
Have you told them yet?

03:36.110 --> 03:37.524
Well, that's um...

03:39.341 --> 03:40.581
It's...

03:42.713 --> 03:44.872
I wish you every happiness.

03:46.054 --> 03:48.525
I really do. Don't forget us, will you?

03:48.732 --> 03:50.126
How could I?

03:58.571 --> 04:00.852
You do understand, don't you?

04:03.582 --> 04:05.657
Four vicars I've seen come and go.

04:06.189 --> 04:08.789
Makes no odds to me whose socks I darn.

04:11.527 --> 04:16.579
I publish the banns of marriage
between Jack Walter Chapman

04:16.605 --> 04:18.485
and Sylvia Maguire.

04:18.511 --> 04:22.654
If any of you know of any
cause or just impediment

04:22.680 --> 04:25.880
why they should not be joined
together in holy matrimony,

04:26.085 --> 04:27.734
you must declare it now...

04:27.760 --> 04:29.200
(Door opens)

04:43.610 --> 04:46.090
Give him space! Give him space!

04:46.116 --> 04:47.996
Daddy! Daddy!

04:48.269 --> 04:50.162
What have I got in my pocket?

04:50.218 --> 04:52.441
- Humbugs!
- Humbugs!

04:52.569 --> 04:55.400
Humbugs for my little humbugs.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.480
How are you?

05:00.160 --> 05:02.600
That used to be such
a simple question to answer.

05:06.753 --> 05:08.360
Where's Esme?

05:12.687 --> 05:16.154
Esme, are you not coming
down to say hello?

05:17.982 --> 05:20.550
I don't talk to people who make Mum cry.

05:29.362 --> 05:31.969
Geordie. Geordie?

05:32.799 --> 05:34.133
Geordie?

05:35.082 --> 05:37.290
- Yes?
- You're needed.

05:38.665 --> 05:42.266
So why is our friend Lawrence
so utterly obsessed with sex?

05:43.280 --> 05:45.267
Because he views it as a discovery,

05:45.566 --> 05:47.806
as an exploration of ourselves,

05:47.994 --> 05:49.834
of our inner darkest desires.

05:50.982 --> 05:53.916
There is evidence of this as far
back as The White Peacock,

05:53.942 --> 05:55.542
obviously in Sons And Lovers,

05:55.568 --> 05:58.443
and never more profoundly than
in Lady Chatterley's Lover.

05:59.958 --> 06:01.720
This crucial thematic vein

06:01.760 --> 06:03.688
some would argue is present
in all of his novels,

06:03.714 --> 06:05.848
his poetry, and indeed some of his...

06:05.874 --> 06:07.666
- Dad!
- What does it say?

06:08.236 --> 06:10.709
- Do not disturb.
- Do not disturb.

06:15.762 --> 06:18.240
Your son's had an accident, Mr Reilly.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.680
(Melancholy piece plays)

06:29.040 --> 06:31.080
Charlotte, what was he
doing in the meadow?

06:31.120 --> 06:33.560
(Baby cries)

06:33.600 --> 06:35.200
(Crying continues)

06:37.479 --> 06:40.494
This man, what did he look like?

06:41.103 --> 06:42.680
He had a brown hat.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.480
No further than the garden, we agreed.

06:44.520 --> 06:47.287
- So who was watching them?
- Sally!

06:48.813 --> 06:50.087
Yes, ma'am?

06:52.324 --> 06:54.363
Could you see the man's face?

06:55.614 --> 06:57.015
Not even a bit of it?

06:57.218 --> 06:58.658
He had a scarf.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.447
What colour was the scarf?

07:03.345 --> 07:05.825
- Green.
- Green?

07:07.390 --> 07:08.799
And white.

07:09.191 --> 07:11.894
- And a bit red.
- It's an awful lot of colours.

07:13.380 --> 07:15.500
- I think he was a spy.
- Ha!

07:17.640 --> 07:20.094
A spy, for pity's sake!

07:22.270 --> 07:24.950
You fell over and the man went away?

07:25.615 --> 07:28.508
And you don't remember
anything else about him?

07:33.586 --> 07:36.480
Our son has a rather vivid imagination.

07:37.099 --> 07:38.914
I'm not sure he's lying, Mr Reilly.

07:39.031 --> 07:40.880
Archie believes what he's saying,
absolutely.

07:40.906 --> 07:43.609
But a self-perceived truth
born of fantasy is not fact.

07:43.635 --> 07:45.117
Ladies, shall we?

07:55.351 --> 07:58.444
The boy could be making
it up. All that spy stuff.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.960
A scarf of many colours.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.320
I had an overactive
imagination as a kid.

08:03.469 --> 08:04.939
Didn't make me a liar.

08:04.965 --> 08:06.220
What do you mean, had?

08:07.282 --> 08:10.062
You still believe in a big fella
watching over us from a cloud.

08:12.738 --> 08:14.177
I did it, Geordie.

08:16.005 --> 08:18.445
- I resigned.
- Yeah, bollocks.

08:26.567 --> 08:28.167
Jesus Christ!

08:30.390 --> 08:31.658
What will you do?

08:32.102 --> 08:33.578
I have no idea.

08:35.067 --> 08:36.399
Good on you, Sidney.

08:37.551 --> 08:38.782
Do you think so?

08:40.948 --> 08:42.123
Do you?

08:45.588 --> 08:46.791
Yes.

08:48.414 --> 08:50.330
Maybe now you'll stop
being a bloody misery.

08:50.356 --> 08:51.719
Only if you will.

08:56.059 --> 08:57.498
The boy's making it up.

08:58.615 --> 09:00.272
A shilling says he isn't.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.241
Let's see what his teacher says, then.

09:08.279 --> 09:09.673
Archie Reilly.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.416
Oh, God. What's he done now?

09:12.838 --> 09:14.846
- What's he like?
- A handful.

09:15.322 --> 09:16.814
Does he make up stories?

09:17.692 --> 09:19.181
They all make up stories.

09:20.475 --> 09:22.195
He's certainly very tidy.

09:24.634 --> 09:27.352
It's the parents that I'd be
more concerned about.

09:28.399 --> 09:29.467
Why?

09:29.728 --> 09:32.517
A troubled child is always the
product of troubled parents.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.656
Geordie.

09:38.917 --> 09:41.699
They're utter tripe, but
the boys are mad on them.

09:41.725 --> 09:43.013
_

09:43.773 --> 09:45.198
Why did he make it up?

09:45.379 --> 09:48.200
He knows he's not supposed
to go further than the garden

09:48.240 --> 09:49.840
and knows he's in for a good hiding.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.080
Case closed. You buy me a pint.

09:54.826 --> 09:55.966
Not tonight.

09:56.360 --> 10:00.003
Oh. Now you're finally happy, you're
going to ditch me, aren't you?

10:00.565 --> 10:02.800
I'd have ditched you before
if I'd known how.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.960
- Bollocks to you.
- Ditto!

10:28.840 --> 10:30.360
(Sighs)

10:43.195 --> 10:45.075
Ready, set, go!

10:45.397 --> 10:48.094
One, two, three,

10:48.120 --> 10:50.599
four, five, six,

10:50.625 --> 10:53.738
seven, eight, nine, ten,

10:53.764 --> 10:55.943
- 11, 12...
- No peeking, Archie!

10:58.560 --> 11:00.440
(Sobs)

11:12.095 --> 11:14.735
- I should be back by three.
- Where does it leave me?

11:16.060 --> 11:21.431
A new vicar moves in,
someone less... tolerant...

11:24.010 --> 11:27.058
You don't need me. You'll be fine.

11:28.788 --> 11:30.464
I should have known, really.

11:31.073 --> 11:34.036
You always walk away when
people need you the most.

11:37.649 --> 11:39.387
It's my decision, Leonard.

11:40.538 --> 11:42.676
It has to be my decision.

11:51.550 --> 11:52.876
Found you!

11:57.307 --> 11:58.466
Jacob?

12:01.760 --> 12:02.883
Jacob?

12:09.359 --> 12:10.802
Watch your step.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.007
On second thoughts, maybe
I should put these back up!

12:26.033 --> 12:28.120
I think it has a certain charm.

12:28.230 --> 12:31.670
The mould does make an interesting
talking point, I suppose.

12:32.846 --> 12:34.037
What's the smell?

12:34.148 --> 12:36.348
I think it might be
the previous occupant.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.520
With a lick of paint, I can see us here.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.615
I can really see us here.

12:47.091 --> 12:50.239
Rent's two pounds a week,
not including electric.

12:50.465 --> 12:51.805
Two pounds?

12:51.973 --> 12:54.720
This is a most desirable area.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.600
- Mrs?
- Chambers.

12:56.715 --> 12:58.334
Mrs Chambers.

12:58.998 --> 13:02.640
We have other interest. So if
you don't intend to take it...

13:02.824 --> 13:03.957
We'll take it.

13:03.983 --> 13:06.926
I'll need four pounds deposit
by closing tomorrow.

13:07.445 --> 13:09.158
Put those back up, please.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.840
Welcome home, Chambers!

13:18.510 --> 13:20.000
I only left it there for ten minutes.

13:20.040 --> 13:23.040
Right, OK. And they were
both on the high street?

13:23.400 --> 13:24.485
Yes.

13:24.796 --> 13:27.120
- Both stolen at the same time?
- Yes.

13:27.838 --> 13:29.799
- They weren't padlocked?
- No.

13:33.276 --> 13:34.676
(Phone rings)

13:39.320 --> 13:42.263
- Keating.
- Jacob Reilly's gone missing.

13:42.867 --> 13:45.280
- It's all coming with us.
- Even the Bechet?

13:45.306 --> 13:47.768
Especially the Bechet.

13:48.524 --> 13:49.770
As far as I'm concerned,

13:49.796 --> 13:51.840
the only people that enjoy
jazz concerts are the musicians.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.640
Why do there have to be
so many twiddly bits?

13:54.680 --> 13:56.680
(Police bells ring)

14:10.800 --> 14:13.242
You didn't see anyone when you
were playing hide and seek?

14:15.363 --> 14:16.883
No one on the meadows?

14:17.600 --> 14:20.963
Archie, think hard. Please, think.

14:20.989 --> 14:22.680
It was just me and Jacob.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.161
The man who chased you that time,

14:26.304 --> 14:29.063
the scarf he was wearing,
the one we talked about.

14:33.150 --> 14:34.413
Was it like this?

14:38.359 --> 14:39.771
Girton College.

14:39.797 --> 14:41.360
But the students are all women.

14:42.117 --> 14:43.437
And...

14:43.463 --> 14:45.738
Which college do you teach at,
Mr Reilly?

14:47.200 --> 14:48.438
Girton.

14:50.382 --> 14:51.982
Could it be one of your pupils?

14:54.070 --> 14:56.653
Do you know anyone who might
want to bring your family harm?

14:59.040 --> 15:00.944
- No.
- Someone with a grudge?

15:00.970 --> 15:01.964
No!

15:01.990 --> 15:06.518
Someone singled out
your family... your children.

15:07.056 --> 15:08.873
If there's something
you're not telling us...

15:12.466 --> 15:14.986
I should be out there.
I need to be out there.

15:29.600 --> 15:33.661
Why try and take one child and
then take his brother instead?

15:34.108 --> 15:36.273
In cases like this,
it's often the family.

15:37.351 --> 15:40.280
- You think it's him?
- He's got a temper.

15:40.530 --> 15:42.730
- Mother's not exactly maternal.
- Over here!

15:43.520 --> 15:44.696
Over here.

15:46.493 --> 15:48.533
OK, move back. Move back.

15:53.092 --> 15:55.405
- Is this Jacob's?
- Yes.

16:01.796 --> 16:04.023
OK, give us room to work, please.

16:06.828 --> 16:08.708
You, yours is the house on the end.

16:08.734 --> 16:09.725
Yes.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.586
My boys walk past you every morning.

16:12.773 --> 16:14.521
So do a lot of people.

16:14.741 --> 16:15.953
Do you say hello to them?

16:16.720 --> 16:19.304
- Occasionally.
- What else do you do?

16:20.586 --> 16:22.480
- I'm sorry?
- Mr Marlowe isn't a suspect.

16:22.520 --> 16:26.080
- No? What else do you do?
- Come away, Mr Reilly.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.834
You were caught up in that mess
with the Redmond girl.

16:28.936 --> 16:30.280
That had nothing to do with me.

16:30.462 --> 16:31.920
- Search him.
- Mr Reilly.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.127
Search him!

16:34.000 --> 16:36.080
We all know what you are. We all know!

16:36.120 --> 16:38.040
- What's that, Mr Reilly?
- Leonard.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.240
No. What is it you believe he is?

16:48.431 --> 16:49.671
Jacob!

16:50.637 --> 16:51.962
Jacob!

16:52.520 --> 16:54.520
(Projector whirs)

17:05.560 --> 17:07.151
(Door opens)

17:11.240 --> 17:13.165
They've called off the search.

17:13.779 --> 17:15.579
They'll start again at dawn.

17:17.501 --> 17:19.651
Jacob has to sleep with the light on.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.729
I hope whoever took him knows that.

17:28.344 --> 17:30.040
I'd like to go to church.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.680
(Ringing tone)

17:38.280 --> 17:40.440
- Cathy.
- <i>It's late.</i>

17:40.871 --> 17:42.480
Do something for me.

17:42.660 --> 17:45.180
- Check on the kids.
- <i>They're asleep.</i>

17:46.600 --> 17:48.600
Just go and look in on them, would you?

17:49.413 --> 17:51.059
<i>They're fine, Geordie.</i>

17:51.523 --> 17:52.976
I'm sorry.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.842
I'm so sorry for everything.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.560
(Line goes dead)

18:06.520 --> 18:08.840
GABRIEL: Please help Jacob
find his way back home.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.448
And be with him in his hour of need.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.120
In Jesus' name, we beseech you.

18:19.877 --> 18:21.080
Amen.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.679
CONGREGATION: Amen.

18:24.960 --> 18:28.783
It's my... boy that's gone.

18:29.892 --> 18:31.492
My boy Jacob.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.320
God is with him.

18:36.341 --> 18:38.200
God will keep him safe.

18:39.237 --> 18:40.637
(She sobs)

18:54.673 --> 18:58.182
- I wanted to thank you.
- There's no need.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.190
It was brave of you.

19:01.860 --> 19:05.000
Bravery is a not so
distant cousin of folly,

19:05.266 --> 19:06.906
I've always thought.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.430
It's a wonder how even the
most educated of people

19:11.456 --> 19:14.520
can confuse a predilection
for men with one for boys.

19:14.809 --> 19:19.440
I'm not sure people are ready
to be open about these things.

19:20.944 --> 19:23.078
I'm not sure they're even ready
to think about them.

19:24.666 --> 19:26.920
You never came to collect
your photographs.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.432
The engagement's been postponed.

19:29.458 --> 19:30.559
Oh.

19:30.872 --> 19:34.160
In as much as it's not
happening any more.

19:34.395 --> 19:36.431
- I'm very sorry to hear that.
- Yes.

19:49.018 --> 19:52.778
There was a knife in the kitchen sink.

19:59.640 --> 20:00.807
Leonard.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.134
It feels like drowning.

20:52.107 --> 20:53.444
I'm under the sea.

20:54.556 --> 20:55.916
I'm looking up.

20:58.107 --> 21:01.229
And part of me thinks maybe...

21:03.480 --> 21:07.907
..it would be better just to let go.

21:08.916 --> 21:10.316
But you don't.

21:10.959 --> 21:12.239
I pretend.

21:15.466 --> 21:18.349
And the people I love the most
don't even see it.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.200
See what?

21:21.645 --> 21:23.181
That I'm not good enough.

21:26.023 --> 21:28.267
And I haven't been good enough
for my children.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.000
You wouldn't hurt your son?

21:32.040 --> 21:33.064
No.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.720
Your husband wouldn't hurt him?

21:38.240 --> 21:41.000
All the secrets and the lying.

21:42.840 --> 21:46.280
We've both hurt them
in our own sort of way.

21:47.154 --> 21:48.505
What secrets?

21:49.840 --> 21:52.321
I know what they see in him, his pupils.

21:53.011 --> 21:55.125
I used to see it too.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.605
He's having an affair?

21:59.712 --> 22:01.801
If only it were just the one.

22:02.794 --> 22:05.480
I need names. Every pupil
you've had relations with.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.918
I haven't had relations with any pupils.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.640
How many have there been?

22:12.307 --> 22:13.481
Is this relevant?

22:13.507 --> 22:16.556
Jilted lover wants to get back
at you. She takes your boy.

22:17.516 --> 22:19.426
How many have there been, Mr Reilly?

22:22.075 --> 22:25.185
- Just one.
- You really do think me a fool, don't you?

22:28.960 --> 22:30.680
(Baby grizzles)

22:30.767 --> 22:32.367
Names, Mr Reilly.

22:50.125 --> 22:51.974
You thought you were
the only one, didn't you?

22:52.687 --> 22:55.337
How many were there on his list?

22:57.200 --> 22:58.360
Five.

22:59.588 --> 23:01.636
Then I must be number six.

23:02.948 --> 23:04.449
How auspicious.

23:06.081 --> 23:07.948
He said he'd leave her for me.

23:08.941 --> 23:10.464
How stupid am I?

23:11.290 --> 23:13.966
Why didn't you take the boys
to school yesterday?

23:16.680 --> 23:18.320
Me and Richard...

23:20.251 --> 23:22.440
..we wait until everyone's
out of the house.

23:23.492 --> 23:24.880
Did Jacob know?

23:24.920 --> 23:26.080
No.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.050
Perhaps he saw you together.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.876
I wouldn't hurt him!

23:33.482 --> 23:35.202
This is my fault, isn't it?

23:36.680 --> 23:38.319
I didn't take care of them.

23:42.651 --> 23:44.014
No one did.

23:52.403 --> 23:54.180
Who was taking care of them?

23:54.676 --> 23:57.080
- The boys.
- No one. No one gave a shit.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.696
Somebody's been feeding them,
cleaning them.

24:00.716 --> 24:03.166
What if Jacob wasn't kidnapped?

24:04.272 --> 24:05.861
What if he's been rescued?

24:12.486 --> 24:14.668
And then I just lifted the hem.

24:14.694 --> 24:16.294
Just a little.

24:17.306 --> 24:19.557
God put that hem there for a reason.

24:19.999 --> 24:21.919
Ah! What do we think?

24:27.520 --> 24:29.737
Is it a little...

24:29.763 --> 24:30.905
What?

24:31.460 --> 24:33.328
Dowdy. Dour.

24:33.354 --> 24:35.314
A wedding is a solemn occasion.

24:35.598 --> 24:37.480
It calls for solemn attire.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.200
(Clattering)

24:39.620 --> 24:41.460
Haven't I seen you in that before?

24:41.486 --> 24:44.144
- No.
- Oh.

24:44.230 --> 24:47.640
- What about the grey?
- I look like a harlot in it.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.574
How is that remotely possible?

24:50.440 --> 24:52.698
- (Clattering outside)
- Oh, that noise!

24:55.004 --> 24:56.688
What do you think?

24:57.411 --> 24:59.640
- It's a tent, Jack.
- It's a marquee.

24:59.680 --> 25:02.520
It's canvas, irritating
ropes to trip over.

25:02.546 --> 25:04.927
- It's a tent.
- I know it's not the Ritz.

25:05.981 --> 25:09.031
But we can fix it up
with flowers and whatnot.

25:09.057 --> 25:10.697
I'm rather partial to bunting.

25:11.346 --> 25:12.996
I don't trust anyone who isn't.

25:13.893 --> 25:16.171
All of you just do what you like!

25:19.794 --> 25:22.120
If you had an idea
of who took your brother,

25:22.160 --> 25:24.200
you would say, wouldn't you?

25:26.064 --> 25:27.364
Archie?

25:29.360 --> 25:31.480
You've been such a grown up boy.

25:32.441 --> 25:33.994
But Mummy's here now.

25:34.244 --> 25:37.326
You don't have to be grown up any more.

25:42.243 --> 25:44.677
Who's been looking after you, Archie?

25:46.705 --> 25:48.866
I don't want to get him in trouble.

25:50.480 --> 25:53.640
If you give Martha two thirds
of your chocolate bar,

25:53.680 --> 25:55.179
how much does that leave you?

25:56.880 --> 25:58.796
- Simon?
- A third, sir.

25:58.910 --> 26:00.910
A third. You're a genius, Simon.

26:00.936 --> 26:02.936
And a very generous chap.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.520
Please. Take all the time you need.

26:33.293 --> 26:36.291
That's my son. My son Oscar.

26:36.317 --> 26:38.957
- He lives with his mother.
- Been here recently, has he?

26:40.637 --> 26:41.956
Yesterday.

26:43.532 --> 26:44.852
Guv.

26:45.751 --> 26:47.682
Is this yours, Mr Davies?

26:51.798 --> 26:55.118
So you care very much
for Archie and Jacob.

26:56.491 --> 26:58.491
I care for all my pupils.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.509
But the Reillys especially?

27:04.081 --> 27:07.003
They need someone to look out for them.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.882
And that someone is you?

27:08.944 --> 27:11.636
I would never harm a child.

27:14.529 --> 27:17.630
You know me, Sidney. You know that.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.720
We are not going to find
the boy this way.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.943
- He's an intelligent man.
- And I'm not?

27:28.969 --> 27:31.490
I'm just saying tread lightly.

27:32.057 --> 27:35.280
As long as Jacob is out there,
I'm damned if I tread lightly!

27:35.320 --> 27:36.680
Geordie!

27:37.380 --> 27:39.466
You knowing him isn't helping.

27:41.591 --> 27:43.285
Go and play house with your girlfriend.

28:08.120 --> 28:11.280
- Amanda!
- She's already gone.

28:11.633 --> 28:13.450
- Damn it!
- Sidney?

28:15.563 --> 28:17.334
You don't have to do that.

28:17.360 --> 28:20.164
Every penny helps when
you're getting your own home.

28:29.241 --> 28:31.041
People need you, Sidney.

28:31.769 --> 28:34.328
They look to you, not to the Church.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.117
They look to you.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.948
I do have other business to
attend to, Mrs Chambers.

29:04.974 --> 29:06.192
He'll be here.

29:13.840 --> 29:17.520
What do you want from me?
What is it that you want?

29:18.417 --> 29:19.440
Tell me.

29:20.136 --> 29:21.578
I love her.

29:24.306 --> 29:26.416
Why is that not enough for you?

29:26.919 --> 29:29.394
Can't love be enough? Why...

29:30.525 --> 29:32.720
Why can't it be enough?

29:43.481 --> 29:45.424
How about we play a game?

29:46.213 --> 29:47.840
Every time I think
you're lying, I do this.

29:47.880 --> 29:48.880
(Taps glass)

29:50.816 --> 29:54.081
- Where's Jacob?
- I don't know.

29:54.644 --> 29:58.232
- When did you last see him?
- At school.

29:59.704 --> 30:02.922
I... I can't remember precisely.

30:03.008 --> 30:05.408
PHIL: Marriage ended, did it, Mr Davies?

30:08.152 --> 30:11.053
- Two years back.
- But you still see your son.

30:11.186 --> 30:12.663
As often as I can.

30:13.053 --> 30:15.920
You love the children
in your class, don't you?

30:17.236 --> 30:19.680
You make it sound sordid.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.440
You feel protective of them.

30:22.126 --> 30:23.230
Yes.

30:23.760 --> 30:27.000
Do you consider it your duty
to every child?

30:28.021 --> 30:29.440
- Yes.
- (Taps glass)

30:30.202 --> 30:33.073
- (Sighs)
- Not just a few favourites?

30:33.560 --> 30:35.080
No.

30:36.058 --> 30:39.650
How far would you go to
protect a child, Mr Davies?

30:40.394 --> 30:42.628
I'd go to any lengths permissible.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.574
Would you kidnap them?

30:48.936 --> 30:50.016
No.

30:53.119 --> 30:55.422
Would you take them from their parents?

30:55.484 --> 30:56.644
No.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.360
Would you take them from their parents?

30:59.400 --> 31:00.583
No!

31:09.718 --> 31:11.478
Get me another glass of water, Phil.

31:11.504 --> 31:13.504
- Guv?
- Get me another glass of water.

31:22.841 --> 31:24.481
(Turns lock)

31:30.320 --> 31:32.760
(Turns lock)

31:33.396 --> 31:34.720
Where is he?

31:35.546 --> 31:37.034
I don't know.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.285
Stand up.

31:48.852 --> 31:50.320
I don't know... Agh!

31:54.287 --> 31:56.480
- Guv?
- (Groans)

31:57.558 --> 31:59.474
Geordie! Open the door.

32:00.547 --> 32:01.880
Open the door.

32:02.835 --> 32:04.029
Shit!

32:04.055 --> 32:08.043
Mrs Davies, I'm calling on
behalf of Cambridgeshire police.

32:08.243 --> 32:09.840
PHIL: Where do we keep the keys?

32:10.115 --> 32:11.484
SIDNEY: Geordie?

32:20.931 --> 32:22.531
Geordie's lost it.

32:22.868 --> 32:26.257
- Where is he?
- I spoke to Mark Davies's wife.

32:29.313 --> 32:31.153
- SIDNEY: Geordie?
- (Rap at door)

32:31.410 --> 32:34.631
His son died. His son's dead.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.449
He died in a car crash.

32:36.475 --> 32:37.920
Mark was driving.

32:38.978 --> 32:41.105
- (Banging)
- Open the door.

32:41.131 --> 32:42.970
Geordie, open the door!

33:17.592 --> 33:19.512
What happened in there, Geordie?

33:20.292 --> 33:22.023
You can't carry on like this.

33:24.823 --> 33:28.152
You had an affair.
Is that what this is about?

33:30.526 --> 33:32.277
How long are you going
to punish yourself for?

33:32.303 --> 33:34.906
A week? A year?

33:34.932 --> 33:36.671
How long is enough?

33:50.909 --> 33:53.229
It wasn't love at first sight,
me and Cathy.

33:55.918 --> 33:57.960
But there was this moment.

33:58.736 --> 34:00.138
It was a few months in.

34:02.522 --> 34:04.789
We were saying goodbye
at a train station.

34:07.286 --> 34:12.161
She walked away and I
couldn't stop watching her.

34:15.476 --> 34:17.123
She looked back.

34:20.364 --> 34:22.156
Oh, my heart...

34:26.407 --> 34:28.440
I don't deserve to be forgiven.

34:30.380 --> 34:31.789
Yes, you do.

34:35.018 --> 34:36.379
We all do.

34:38.871 --> 34:40.588
God forgives you.

34:42.696 --> 34:44.320
I don't believe in God.

34:47.049 --> 34:49.213
Well, then, I forgive you.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.280
As a friend.

34:54.007 --> 34:55.815
And as someone who loves you.

34:56.947 --> 34:58.457
I forgive you.

35:01.006 --> 35:04.970
Geordie... I forgive you.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.880
(Sobs)

35:24.200 --> 35:27.671
What did he like, your boy Oscar?

35:28.700 --> 35:30.907
Maths, English?

35:32.065 --> 35:33.188
Drawing.

35:33.422 --> 35:35.113
You must think about him.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.516
Every day.

35:37.463 --> 35:38.809
What do you remember?

35:39.100 --> 35:42.565
His laugh, his hand in mine.

35:47.538 --> 35:50.116
The sound of his breathing
when he was falling asleep.

35:50.177 --> 35:54.017
The Reillys miss that.
They want Jacob home.

35:57.042 --> 35:58.580
You were keeping him safe

35:58.620 --> 36:00.980
because you care about him so much.

36:01.216 --> 36:03.287
What happened to Oscar was an accident.

36:04.224 --> 36:06.211
It was an accident.

36:12.100 --> 36:13.528
Where's Jacob?

36:27.957 --> 36:29.117
Jacob!

36:35.525 --> 36:37.125
- He'll be fine.
- I missed you!

36:37.151 --> 36:38.951
- Thank you so much.
- Come here!

36:54.660 --> 36:56.395
Your resignation letter.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.235
You were never going to send it.

37:04.660 --> 37:06.043
I should have known.

37:09.036 --> 37:10.707
I did know, really.

37:12.875 --> 37:14.515
It's who I am.

37:16.991 --> 37:18.509
It's not the Church.

37:18.901 --> 37:21.540
I love what I do because...

37:21.580 --> 37:23.220
You are what you do.

37:24.973 --> 37:26.507
I wanted this.

37:29.211 --> 37:30.860
I wanted this so much.

37:30.900 --> 37:32.761
I let myself believe you when I...

37:33.219 --> 37:35.305
I knew all along.

37:36.288 --> 37:38.210
- I love you.
- You love me?

37:38.406 --> 37:40.606
You love me? What about Grace?

37:42.099 --> 37:43.380
I'm so sorry.

37:43.420 --> 37:45.700
The day she was born, you were there.

37:47.204 --> 37:49.500
I let you treat her like she was yours.

37:49.540 --> 37:51.220
Why did I do that?

37:51.713 --> 37:54.696
- I will always love her.
- But you won't be there!

37:59.100 --> 38:00.882
I'm so... I'm sorry.

38:09.700 --> 38:11.620
I'm sorry.

38:30.408 --> 38:34.328
If you want to take
the service, I'd understand.

38:37.681 --> 38:39.407
You do it, Leonard.

38:44.847 --> 38:48.207
It gets easier, you know?

38:50.073 --> 38:51.793
Living with a broken heart.

38:54.257 --> 38:56.297
Whoever told you that was an idiot.

39:04.808 --> 39:06.225
What do we think?

39:11.930 --> 39:16.025
I think... you're missing something.

39:16.051 --> 39:17.415
Oh, dear. What?

39:20.848 --> 39:23.328
Don't you dare make me cry.

39:44.453 --> 39:47.500
Mrs M, I would be honoured

39:47.540 --> 39:49.757
if you'd allow me to give you away.

39:51.173 --> 39:53.191
Now you've gone and done it!

39:56.027 --> 39:57.987
Daddy! Daddy!

39:58.097 --> 39:59.737
Hey!

40:01.059 --> 40:03.019
Doesn't Mummy look lovely?

40:04.827 --> 40:06.590
Yes, she does.

40:08.459 --> 40:11.469
- Come and sit with us!
- Inside now.

40:11.495 --> 40:13.975
And I want you on your best behaviour.

40:14.226 --> 40:15.386
Go on.

40:24.587 --> 40:26.569
I could do with a drink.

40:26.595 --> 40:28.020
You're not the only one.

40:28.818 --> 40:30.004
Ahem.

40:38.460 --> 40:40.100
(Organ starts playing)

40:42.060 --> 40:44.260
(MUSIC: Wedding March)

41:07.873 --> 41:09.380
You look wonderful.

41:09.420 --> 41:11.220
- Leonard!
- Sorry.

41:11.973 --> 41:16.215
..and forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto him

41:16.241 --> 41:18.312
so long as you both shall live?

41:18.338 --> 41:19.658
I will.

41:19.685 --> 41:23.180
And who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?

41:23.560 --> 41:24.940
I do.

41:29.719 --> 41:33.339
When Jesus turned water into wine,

41:33.481 --> 41:35.711
it wasn't just an excellent party trick.

41:36.047 --> 41:39.018
Marriage is like wine.

41:39.044 --> 41:40.637
It gets better with age.

41:40.833 --> 41:43.780
But it takes work to
keep it from going sour.

41:44.180 --> 41:46.441
Forgive when you want to blame.

41:46.467 --> 41:50.420
Be honest. Accept each other's foibles.

41:51.311 --> 41:52.765
Accept your own.

41:53.859 --> 41:57.900
Because if you don't, no one else will.

41:59.780 --> 42:01.260
(Big band music plays)

42:02.235 --> 42:04.361
If we could have Mrs Maguire's family.

42:04.387 --> 42:06.107
Mrs Chapman.

42:17.060 --> 42:18.700
Go and speak to her.

42:19.982 --> 42:21.387
What would I say?

42:22.999 --> 42:25.300
You don't need me for that.

42:37.672 --> 42:39.165
Thought you might like a drink.

42:39.384 --> 42:40.741
Thank you.

42:45.189 --> 42:46.829
I forgot, didn't I...

42:48.396 --> 42:52.189
..in the midst of all the
nappies and the laundry.

42:54.297 --> 42:55.983
I forgot it was you and me.

42:58.139 --> 43:00.020
I never forgot, Geordie.

43:04.380 --> 43:05.892
Turn back.

43:08.601 --> 43:10.140
Turn back.

43:20.460 --> 43:22.100
(Slow tune playing)

43:28.497 --> 43:29.617
Happy?

43:31.718 --> 43:35.340
First love is never the last.

43:38.503 --> 43:40.503
I miss her so much.

43:44.500 --> 43:45.923
(Sobs)

43:53.500 --> 43:56.408
SIDNEY: Love leaves you
or it finds you again.

43:58.803 --> 44:01.188
Love brings sorrow.

44:02.500 --> 44:04.530
Or it brings hope.

44:05.272 --> 44:07.260
But we should always be brave

44:07.300 --> 44:10.236
and open our hearts to it.

44:11.972 --> 44:16.060
Maybe people aren't ready
for us to be honest.

44:20.392 --> 44:22.814
We should at least be
honest with ourselves.

44:31.955 --> 44:34.158
To love is to live.

44:35.197 --> 44:38.510
And we must do so with all our hearts

44:38.536 --> 44:41.660
and with all our soul
and with all our might.

44:41.700 --> 44:45.860
If you would raise your glasses
to Mrs M and Jack!

44:45.900 --> 44:48.820
- Mrs C!
- To Mrs C and Jack!

44:48.860 --> 44:50.660
ALL: Mrs C and Jack!

44:50.700 --> 44:52.700
And to love.

44:52.918 --> 44:54.238
ALL: To love!

44:54.264 --> 44:56.264
(Glasses clinking)

45:02.780 --> 45:04.380
- How's Cathy?
- Good.

45:04.420 --> 45:05.707
Just good?

45:06.131 --> 45:09.040
Right now, just good is
about bloody perfect.

45:12.780 --> 45:14.168
You know what you need?

45:14.620 --> 45:17.140
No. No. No!

45:17.180 --> 45:19.540
- I haven't said anything.
- You want to find me a girl.

45:19.580 --> 45:22.300
You don't want to be the only one not
getting your end away at the vicarage.

45:22.340 --> 45:23.500
- Mrs M.
- Please don't.

45:23.540 --> 45:25.888
- Leonard.
- Leonard?

45:26.177 --> 45:29.202
Daniel Marlowe didn't leave that
wedding with just a slice of cake.

45:30.499 --> 45:31.660
You're kidding?

45:32.999 --> 45:34.546
You're not kidding.

45:34.938 --> 45:36.538
Blimey!

45:39.332 --> 45:40.940
Let me set you up with a girl.

45:42.018 --> 45:44.273
Buy me a pint and shut up.

45:45.059 --> 45:46.340
Backgammon?

45:46.380 --> 45:49.700
- If we must.
- Oh, it's the game, Sidney.

45:50.599 --> 45:52.279
It's the game.

45:52.444 --> 45:54.444
(Dog barks)
