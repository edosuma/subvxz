WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:05.293
WILL:
This is no longer a dream.
This is reality.

00:05.330 --> 00:09.437
Three months from now, we are
opening offices in New York.

00:09.470 --> 00:11.301
(applause)
I want to say something.

00:11.340 --> 00:13.228
Not now, Howard.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.373
We are growing.

00:15.410 --> 00:17.105
Share that with your clients.

00:17.150 --> 00:19.539
The era of constriction is over.

00:19.580 --> 00:22.344
Now, a new era

00:22.390 --> 00:24.119
needs new branding.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.087
"LIG."

00:26.120 --> 00:27.553
Own those letters.

00:27.590 --> 00:29.729
No one says
"Lockhart/Gardner" anymore.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.194
It's "L.G."

00:34.330 --> 00:35.729
I'll be right back.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.660
Who's thinking of leaving?

00:37.700 --> 00:39.361
Sonya Rucker. The Wabash Fund.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.288
Chumhum?
No.

00:41.340 --> 00:44.161
Not yet.
Sonya Rucker and Wabash
are leaving Florrick-Agos.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.438
Their infrastructure?
Bad.

00:45.470 --> 00:47.233
Florrick-Agos barely exists.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.508
We've been working out
of Alicia's apartment

00:48.540 --> 00:49.575
for the last two weeks.

00:49.610 --> 00:50.577
That's why I'm
back here.

00:50.610 --> 00:51.838
Did the clients know?
No.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.110
We either met at their offices
or over lunch.

00:54.150 --> 00:55.742
But they are moving
into new offices today.

00:55.780 --> 00:57.213
What offices?
T-shirt factory

00:57.250 --> 00:58.319
on Grand.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.489
Really?
It's all we could...

01:00.520 --> 01:02.226
they could afford.

01:02.260 --> 01:03.488
$20 a square foot.

01:03.530 --> 01:05.589
DIANE:
The connections with the
governor aren't helping AIICIa?

01:05.630 --> 01:07.450
Mm, they're
hurting her.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.661
I lost a client because
of all the ethical issues

01:09.700 --> 01:12.089
from the governor's office.
Thank you,
Anthony.

01:13.140 --> 01:14.391
What a putz.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.431
We should've tried
to get Carey Zepps.

01:16.470 --> 01:17.630
I'll take Rucker.

01:17.670 --> 01:20.434
Will, you take
the Wabash.
(knocking)

01:21.440 --> 01:23.442
I'll be right back.

01:25.150 --> 01:27.448
(chuckles)
How's your course going?

01:27.480 --> 01:30.586
(groans)
When driving in fog,
you should use your...?

01:30.620 --> 01:32.110
Low beams.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.787
That's not true, is it?

01:33.820 --> 01:35.378
It is.

01:35.420 --> 01:37.183
I wrote fog lights.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.425
Why are they called fog lights
if they're not for fog?

01:39.460 --> 01:40.427
To trick you.

01:40.460 --> 01:42.496
(groans)
(chuckles)

01:42.530 --> 01:45.260
How long do you need
my Wi-Fi for?

01:45.300 --> 01:47.268
A few hours.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.268
Want me gone?

01:50.170 --> 01:52.775
Nope. Stay as long as you want.

01:52.810 --> 01:54.300
Mmm.

01:54.340 --> 01:58.447
So, do we have a
Yoko Ono problem here?

01:58.480 --> 02:00.368
Mr. Lee, she's still waiting.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.308
Tell her to come back
tomorrow. Tell her...

02:02.350 --> 02:04.614
all the partners are busy.
I'm not busy.
Who is it?

02:04.650 --> 02:06.481
A walk-in. Not much money.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.158
She says she
used to work here.

02:08.190 --> 02:10.488
I'll take care of it.

02:10.530 --> 02:12.293
So, uh,

02:12.330 --> 02:13.695
you used to work here,
Ms. Flores?

02:13.730 --> 02:15.891
I did. Two years ago.
Ah.

02:15.930 --> 02:17.466
As an intern.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.467
Now you want to come back?

02:18.500 --> 02:19.467
No.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.263
That was a joke.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.734
Breaking the ice.
(chuckles)

02:23.770 --> 02:27.536
So... how can we help you?

02:27.580 --> 02:29.673
A friend of mine has been swept
up in a raid of businesses

02:29.710 --> 02:31.940
employing undocumented workers.
They've threatened

02:31.980 --> 02:33.538
to deport him
back to Mexico

02:33.580 --> 02:35.411
unless he agrees
to a snitch visa...

02:35.450 --> 02:37.589
Oh, so you're from Mexico?

02:37.620 --> 02:39.258
No.
I love Mexico.

02:39.290 --> 02:41.485
I was down there in the '60s.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.351
Puerto Vallarta.

02:43.390 --> 02:44.550
God, the drinks they had.

02:44.590 --> 02:46.455
You know, the ones.
The-the, um...

02:46.500 --> 02:47.819
The ones, um...

02:47.860 --> 02:50.192
What are they called?

02:50.230 --> 02:51.822
I have no idea.

02:51.870 --> 02:52.837
And the women.

02:52.870 --> 02:54.758
In those dresses.
(chuckles)

02:54.800 --> 02:57.462
Those short dresses.

02:57.510 --> 02:58.738
Mmm.

02:58.770 --> 03:01.273
Could you call
Alicia Florrick for me, please?

03:01.310 --> 03:03.642
A-Actually, Alicia doesn't
work here anymore.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.568
She doesn't?

03:05.610 --> 03:06.918
Where is she?

03:06.950 --> 03:09.817
(truck beeping)

03:25.670 --> 03:27.558
CAREY:
Well, here it is.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.967
The furniture should be arriving
in a few hours.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.500
CARY:
Do we have phones, at least?

03:32.540 --> 03:33.768
CAREY:
Not until tomorrow.

03:33.810 --> 03:35.573
We'll have
to work from cells.

03:35.610 --> 03:37.578
CARY:
We can't meet
with Chumhum here.

03:37.610 --> 03:39.316
Eh, we need to polish
the floors.

03:39.350 --> 03:41.238
You know, make it look
like a hip start-up.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.781
Open floor plan.
No walls.

03:42.820 --> 03:45.311
It'll take us a week.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.918
We can do this.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.622
Hey.

03:54.630 --> 03:56.666
And when did this happen?

03:56.700 --> 03:59.635
Well, right now. The
prosecutor's mid-trial

03:59.670 --> 04:01.297
and he's pressuring Tomas

04:01.340 --> 04:03.501
to sign the snitch
visa before noon.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.532
I told Tomas to wait till
he spoke to a lawyer.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.706
That's your friend? Tomas?

04:07.740 --> 04:09.571
Yes. Tomas Ruiz.

04:09.610 --> 04:11.305
I knew him in school.

04:11.350 --> 04:13.910
And who does this prosecutor
want him to testify against?

04:13.950 --> 04:17.841
Lalo Hierra.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.517
Yes, I know.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.312
It's worrisome.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.658
Okay, let me talk
to my partners.

04:23.690 --> 04:25.783
We're just... starting out.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.627
Yes, I can see that.

04:27.660 --> 04:29.560
Are these just
temporary?

04:29.600 --> 04:30.828
They're gonna look great.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.395
Just give us a week.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.431
(truck beeping outside)

04:38.070 --> 04:39.799
ALICIA:
It's just

04:39.840 --> 04:42.570
consultation on a visa,
but she needs me now.

04:42.610 --> 04:44.077
Is it worth our time?
_I'm not sure
this guy can pay.

04:44.110 --> 04:46.578
He's an undocumented immigrant.
He owns a body shop.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.544
CARY: Well, we can't
be doing pro bono.
No, no, no. We should do it.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.649
CARY: Why?
Natalie Flores works
for a New York lobbyist

04:51.690 --> 04:55.581
named Joe Pal_lotta. He controls
$90 million in client billing.

04:55.620 --> 04:58.327
He can direct Chicago work
our way.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.648
Checked online.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.588
Okay. I'll take it.

05:02.630 --> 05:05.724
(whispers):
Hey, our first new client.

05:05.770 --> 05:06.737
All right.
Yes.

05:06.770 --> 05:07.589
(chuckles)

05:07.640 --> 05:08.959
All right.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.638
All right.
Hey, uh...

05:10.670 --> 05:14.674
who was the last person hired,
the last salaried person?

05:14.710 --> 05:17.008
Why?
I was talking
to Clarke Hayden.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.417
We need to, uh, make cuts
to our payroll.

05:20.450 --> 05:23.908
Carey, we made a commitment
to our employees.
Yes,

05:23.950 --> 05:26.589
and that commitment means
nothing if we go under.

05:26.620 --> 05:27.757
Who was the last person?

05:27.790 --> 05:31.453
Ah. It was Robyn,
wasn't it?

05:31.490 --> 05:34.129
CARY:
We can't let her go.
We'll have no investigator.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.958
CAREY: And how much
have we investigated
in the last two weeks?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.696
Look, it's just for
a few months. I'll talk to her.

05:39.740 --> 05:43.562
QRW
Nqum
Butnotunﬁanday.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.378
I need your answer
now, Mr. Ruiz.

05:50.410 --> 05:53.072
I've been in this country
for nine years, sir.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.610
Our shop pays Social Security

05:54.650 --> 05:58.416
and payroll tax.
Yes, and you're undocumented.

05:58.450 --> 06:00.714
Look, it's very simple.
Lalo Hierra used

06:00.760 --> 06:03.627
your shop to meet with the head
of the Latin Gangsters.

06:03.660 --> 06:06.083
You testify to that fact
and what you heard them say,

06:06.130 --> 06:08.758
and you won't be deported.
(door opens)

06:08.800 --> 06:09.994
Excuse me. _
Could you step outSIde?

06:10.030 --> 06:12.669
Could I... Who are you?

06:12.700 --> 06:14.167
Alicia Florrick,
Mr. Ruiz's attorney.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.634
Who are you?
Mr. Ruiz, it is your right

06:16.670 --> 06:18.501
to have an attorney present,
but I must warn you...

06:18.540 --> 06:19.359
If you want
to warn anyone, warn me.

06:19.410 --> 06:21.970
...any delay in signing
this snitch visa

06:22.010 --> 06:23.705
means the offer could go away.
The_offer's
not g0ing away.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.048
You need him more
than he needs you. Now,

06:26.080 --> 06:27.809
whom am I addressing?
Karl Dolan.

06:27.850 --> 06:30.410
U.S. Attorney. She's gonna
get you deported,

06:30.450 --> 06:33.180
Tomas...
Please step outside,
AUSA Dolan. Right now.

06:33.220 --> 06:34.812
No, that's it.

06:34.860 --> 06:36.623
I'm conferring with my client.

06:36.660 --> 06:39.527
Step outside.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.731
NATALIE:
Tomas, Elena,

06:50.770 --> 06:52.032
this is one of the lawyers
I was talking to you about.

06:52.070 --> 06:53.731
Alicia Florrick.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.806
I'd like you to consider all the
possibilities before you sign.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.717
I know. Lalo is dangerous and
I'll be testifying against him,

06:59.750 --> 07:02.514
but... I...

07:02.550 --> 07:03.744
can't be
without Elena.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.815
I can't
be deported.

07:05.850 --> 07:09.729
That will
truly kill me.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.648
He'll do it.

07:11.690 --> 07:13.453
Praise God.
But he wants

07:13.500 --> 07:15.798
24-hour protection
for his family and himself.

07:15.830 --> 07:17.127
That's already in the visa.
No,

07:17.170 --> 07:19.832
it was promised,
but it's not in the visa.

07:19.870 --> 07:22.703
Also, he wants a promise not to
deport his wife and his girls.

07:22.740 --> 07:23.764
You didn't need to come.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.163
I would've offered all that.

07:25.210 --> 07:27.701
Good. So put it in the visa,

07:27.740 --> 07:29.674
and we'll be ready for court.

07:29.710 --> 07:33.714
MAN:
Six bodies were found hanging
from a bridge outside the city.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.480
Five more were decapitated.
DOLAN:
And did anyone

07:36.520 --> 07:38.112
take responsibility
for the execution?

07:38.150 --> 07:39.788
There was a bullet
left at the scene,

07:39.820 --> 07:41.708
a single .357
Magnum shell

07:41.760 --> 07:43.557
with the letters
"L.C." painted on it.

07:43.590 --> 07:46.889
DOLAN: "L.C."?
MAN:
Short for "El Culebra."

07:46.930 --> 07:47.692
The Snake.

07:47.730 --> 07:48.628
And is there someone

07:48.660 --> 07:50.764
in the cartel
who goes by that nickname?

07:50.800 --> 07:52.791
Yes. The defendant,

07:52.840 --> 07:55.195
Lalo Hierra.
Uh, thank you,
Agent Thorburn.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.732
Just a... Uh, actually,
nothing further, Your Honor.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.271
We would request
a short recess

08:00.310 --> 08:02.870
to prepare a new name
that we'd like to add

08:02.910 --> 08:04.878
to the witness list.
Granted. We'll break for lunch.

08:04.910 --> 08:06.571
Be back at 2:00.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.872
(whispers indistinctly)

08:08.920 --> 08:10.012
Good.

08:10.050 --> 08:11.039
He's scared.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.911
(jackhammering)

08:16.290 --> 08:18.258
ELI:
Alicia, hi.
How are you?

08:18.290 --> 08:19.928
Good.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.928
What's up here? Hi, Marilyn.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.667
Hi, Alicia. I'm sorry. I had a
bout of nausea but I'm all good.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.737
Um, do you guys mind
if I... if I, uh--

08:30.770 --> 08:31.805
No, not at all.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.979
Welcome,
by the way.

08:34.010 --> 08:36.171
Thanks. So...

08:36.210 --> 08:39.714
this is the new... firm.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.149
It's nice.

08:41.180 --> 08:42.784
We're in the early stages yet.

08:42.820 --> 08:43.809
What do you need?

08:44.820 --> 08:46.959
Mm. Sorry, pumpkin Pop-Tart.

08:46.990 --> 08:48.958
They're the only things
that settle my stomach.

08:48.990 --> 08:49.957
Um, Peter

08:49.990 --> 08:52.083
would like to come by
and congratulate you,

08:52.130 --> 08:54.621
and we were acting as a
sort of advance team.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.026
You want to negotiate
his first visit?

08:57.070 --> 08:59.664
No.
Yes.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.567
There can be no photographs
while he's here.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.759
No contacting the press.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.766
No clients to be informed
of his visit.

09:05.810 --> 09:07.607
No press releases.
Look, if Peter wants

09:07.640 --> 09:09.949
to come here to congratulate
his wife on her new firm,

09:09.980 --> 09:11.345
I'm thrilled.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.746
But there'll be no policing
between us.

09:13.780 --> 09:15.668
No rules, no exemptions.
Just Peter

09:15.720 --> 09:17.608
deciding to drop by.
That's all.

09:17.650 --> 09:19.959
Look, Alicia, the only...

09:23.690 --> 09:25.055
(stutters, groans)

09:25.090 --> 09:26.648
Eli, are you all right?

09:26.700 --> 09:29.157
Y-Yes. I'm-I'm-I'm, uh...

09:29.200 --> 09:30.827
Uh...

09:30.870 --> 09:33.134
No, uh, what, um...

09:33.170 --> 09:35.331
Uh...

09:35.370 --> 09:37.600
Okay.

09:37.640 --> 09:40.677
Uh, I'll be right back.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.598
He ran.

09:42.650 --> 09:43.947
What?

09:43.980 --> 09:45.845
Lalo. Uh, Eduardo Hierra.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.040
He fled back to Mexico.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.718
He... When?

09:48.750 --> 09:50.183
An hour ago. He skipped bail,

09:50.220 --> 09:53.610
and the rumor is he caught
a private plane to Nuevo Laredo.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.013
Tomas doesn't have to testify.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.186
Oh...

09:56.220 --> 09:57.778
(chuckles)

09:57.830 --> 09:59.798
Eli,

09:59.830 --> 10:00.922
are you all right?

10:06.800 --> 10:08.791
(elevator door shuts)

10:28.720 --> 10:30.119
(grunts)
(shouts)

10:33.230 --> 10:35.221
I was wondering
if I'd run into you.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.161
I just didn't think
it would be so literal.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.167
I saw you.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.191
Iwas up...

10:41.240 --> 10:43.765
Uh, how lo-- how long
are you in town?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.437
Um, a few days.

10:45.470 --> 10:48.701
I... I've been
following you.

10:48.740 --> 10:50.071
You'v
e.. ?

10:50.110 --> 10:51.077
I mean, wi-winning
the election

10:51.110 --> 10:55.012
and the governorship--
it's all very impressive.

10:55.050 --> 10:56.312
Thank you, thank you.

10:56.350 --> 10:58.716
You, too-- you're at
The Outsider Group.

10:58.750 --> 11:02.459
Yes, um, we've been
following each other.

11:02.490 --> 11:04.458
(both chuckle)

11:04.490 --> 11:06.219
Well, um, I better get going.

11:06.260 --> 11:07.454
I have this thing
with my boss.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.129
Yeah, m-me, too, me, too.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.762
Let's have dinner.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.107
I'm-- what?

11:18.140 --> 11:19.107
Tonight.

11:19.140 --> 11:20.835
Let's have dinner.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.805
Um... yeah,
I'd love that.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.408
(phone rings)

11:26.450 --> 11:28.714
Will Gardner.

11:28.750 --> 11:30.741
Oh, hey, Joe,
what a pleasure.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.486
I need you bad now.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.953
I'd like that.

11:34.990 --> 11:37.151
Today?

11:37.190 --> 11:39.385
No, I haven't seen her.

11:39.430 --> 11:40.749
Okay, what's her name?

11:40.800 --> 11:43.428
Diane, who's
Natalie Flores?

11:43.470 --> 11:45.461
She used to work here.
Why?

11:45.500 --> 11:47.468
That was her boss Joe
Pallotta the lobbyist.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.229
He wants to bring all
his legal work here,

11:49.270 --> 11:50.464
but he sent Natalie
to sound us out.

11:50.510 --> 11:51.465
You haven't seen her?

11:51.510 --> 11:52.807
DIANE: No.
WILL: Okay, well,

11:52.840 --> 11:54.034
can you keep an
eye out for her?

11:54.080 --> 11:55.502
She has a case she
needs help with.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.939
We want to give her
all our attention.

11:56.980 --> 11:59.448
Um...

12:00.920 --> 12:02.785
Yes?

12:02.820 --> 12:05.243
It was a good meeting.

12:05.290 --> 12:06.245
She liked me.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.281
What was the case?

12:08.320 --> 12:10.754
Some Mexican
illegal alien thing.

12:10.790 --> 12:13.520
Howard, what did you say to her?

12:13.560 --> 12:16.051
Nothing.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.261
Nothing-- I complimented her.

12:18.300 --> 12:21.098
I said how great
Mexicans are,

12:21.140 --> 12:23.267
how sexy
they are.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.766
Oh, Lord.

12:26.310 --> 12:29.029
She asked for Alicia
Florrick's address.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.399
(sighs)

12:30.450 --> 12:31.542
It's not gone yet.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.810
Call Joe back
and explain.

12:39.250 --> 12:42.413
(ringtone playing)

12:42.460 --> 12:43.586
Hello.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.190
ELENA:
Mrs. Florrick, they took him,
they took Tomas.

12:46.230 --> 12:47.197
What?

12:47.230 --> 12:48.857
Uh, he-hello, Elena?

12:48.900 --> 12:52.461
The agents said that they were
taking him to Nuevo Laredo.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.036
That's where Lalo is.

12:54.070 --> 12:55.958
Lalo will kill Tomas

12:56.000 --> 12:58.309
as soon as he gets off the bus.

12:58.340 --> 13:01.173
Okay, just sit tight, Elena,
it's been a misunderstanding.

13:01.210 --> 13:03.201
I'll get on with the AUSA.

13:03.250 --> 13:06.276
I saw what he does to snitches,
Mrs. Florrick.

13:06.310 --> 13:09.279
He cuts their stomachs open,
hangs them from bridges.

13:11.490 --> 13:14.812
Please help me, please.

13:14.860 --> 13:15.815
I will.

13:15.860 --> 13:17.851
I will call you right back.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.262
Yes, I need to speak
to AUSA Karl Dolan.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.562
It's an emergency.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.795
Well, find him.

13:43.150 --> 13:46.017
ROBYN:
Kalinda.

13:46.050 --> 13:48.018
You shouldn't be here,
Robyn.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.949
I'll be gone
in ten minutes.

13:50.990 --> 13:52.218
What do you need?

13:53.960 --> 13:56.451
Have they hired anybody
yet to replace me?

13:57.500 --> 13:59.491
You can't come
back here, Robyn.

13:59.530 --> 14:02.135
I know, but why not?

14:02.170 --> 14:04.206
If they haven't hired
anyone, why?

14:04.240 --> 14:07.107
You're at Florrick-Agos.

14:08.980 --> 14:10.971
But they're going to lay me off.

14:13.350 --> 14:17.309
I'm sorry, could you, um,
just put in a good word for me?

14:21.990 --> 14:25.528
Look, Robyn,
it won't work.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.495
They won't hire you
back here.

14:28.530 --> 14:31.169
You know,
too much has happened.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.930
You need to make
yourself hard.

14:33.970 --> 14:36.165
You need to make yourself
indispensable.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.408
That's why
people keep you on.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.476
But I'm not you.

14:41.510 --> 14:43.649
You don't need to be me.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.147
They were laying me off

14:45.180 --> 14:47.410
at the state's attorney's
office five years ago,

14:47.450 --> 14:50.942
so I took control.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.481
Nothing changes you
like the loss of a job.

14:55.690 --> 14:58.181
Now go,
you can't be here.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.433
(buzzing)

15:09.470 --> 15:11.563
NATALIE:
Go ahead, take it.

15:11.610 --> 15:13.009
No.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.405
(chuckles)

15:14.440 --> 15:16.943
Eli, if you don't get it,
I'm going to.

15:16.980 --> 15:18.675
What happened to your
Cirque du Soleil boyfriend?

15:18.710 --> 15:22.441
He got married.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.141
(buzzing continues)

15:24.190 --> 15:25.339
I'm sorry.

15:25.390 --> 15:26.709
You're not sorry.

15:26.750 --> 15:27.956
(both laugh)

15:29.490 --> 15:30.582
It's the governor's office.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.858
I'll call back.

15:31.890 --> 15:36.395
I'm hearing your boss speak at
the Minority Voters' Conference.

15:36.430 --> 15:40.161
Oh.
Yes, I think he's talking
about redistricting,

15:40.200 --> 15:43.738
how it's marginalizing
the minority vote.

15:43.770 --> 15:48.400
Actually, uh, unfortunately
he had to cancel that.

15:48.440 --> 15:52.103
Oh, when was this?

15:52.150 --> 15:55.347
Redistricting is
a hard subject.

15:55.380 --> 15:58.281
Either way, you...
you offend someone.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.379
(phone ringing)

16:04.360 --> 16:06.248
Uh, I should get this.

16:06.290 --> 16:07.257
Please.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.653
Hello.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.066
Alicia?

16:11.100 --> 16:13.091
What's wrong?

16:14.140 --> 16:16.734
Oh, my God, when?

16:16.770 --> 16:19.136
No, no, no, I'll--
I, I will join you.

16:19.170 --> 16:21.570
Um, give me 20 minutes.

16:21.610 --> 16:23.749
Eli, I'm so sorry, I,

16:23.780 --> 16:25.543
um, I have to...

16:25.580 --> 16:27.741
This friend--
he's being deported.

16:27.780 --> 16:29.475
Can we do this
another time?

16:29.520 --> 16:30.509
Yes, of course.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.588
MAN:
I understand you're upset.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.087
Upset?

16:37.130 --> 16:38.529
We're talking
about a man's life.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.154
Tomas Ruiz did
everything you asked.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.292
Not everything--
he didn't testify.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.298
Because he never
had the chance.

16:44.330 --> 16:46.298
Look, that has nothing
to do with my job.

16:46.330 --> 16:48.161
The person he was going
to testify against fled.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.292
That is not his fault.

16:49.340 --> 16:50.307
We have

16:50.340 --> 16:51.762
very few S-visas to give out,

16:51.810 --> 16:53.334
and the rules for granting them
are strict.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.507
The recipient has
to provide testimony

16:55.540 --> 16:57.246
that helps lead to a conviction.

16:57.280 --> 17:00.169
Mr. Dolan,
you asked my client

17:00.220 --> 17:01.573
to inform _ _
on a dangerous criminal,

17:01.620 --> 17:03.178
and when that criminal
jumped bail,

17:03.220 --> 17:04.619
you deported him
to the exact same place

17:04.650 --> 17:05.514
the criminal fled to.

17:05.550 --> 17:08.053
I realize it sounds unfair.
NATALIE: No,

17:08.090 --> 17:09.387
what it sounds like is

17:09.420 --> 17:12.184
a death sentence.

17:12.230 --> 17:15.222
Okay, this
conversation is moot.

17:15.260 --> 17:16.591
At 4:00 am.
Tomas RUIZ

17:16.630 --> 17:18.325
was boarded onto
a deportation bus.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.338
He'll be in Mexico
in 12 hours.

17:20.370 --> 17:23.760
I'm sorry, there's
nothing I can do.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.404
This is the problem.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.374
The feds were looking
for Tomas I. Ruiz.

17:28.410 --> 17:29.377
He's a con man--

17:29.410 --> 17:30.547
insurance fraud,
airbag theft.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.343
That's why his deportation
was expedited.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.519
CARY:
Our guy is Tomas Y. Ruiz,

17:34.550 --> 17:35.812
but, uh, they think
he's the con man.

17:35.850 --> 17:37.488
They're deporting
the wrong guy.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.748
We can't clear this up?

17:38.790 --> 17:40.382
Unfortunately immigration has
him listed with both spellings.

17:40.420 --> 17:41.614
And since neither
of them has

17:41.660 --> 17:42.809
a valid Social
Security number...

17:42.860 --> 17:44.350
As far
as the government's concerned,

17:44.390 --> 17:45.482
they're the same person.

17:45.530 --> 17:49.455
So, what do we do?
ROBYN:
Find the other Tomas Ruiz.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.628
Show the feds
they deported the wrong man.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.868
And how do we do that?

17:55.900 --> 17:58.835
Let me find him.

17:58.870 --> 18:02.704
Well, we have 11 hours
till Tomas crosses the border.

18:02.740 --> 18:05.106
Then, I'd better get started.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.475
Okay, I'll see if I can get
anywhere in court.

18:12.690 --> 18:14.487
Howard Lyman is one
of our oldest partners.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.714
We keep him around
as a legacy.

18:15.760 --> 18:16.715
(slaps)

18:16.760 --> 18:18.648
I'll be right back.
Want anything?

18:18.690 --> 18:20.328
Look, have Natalie
Flores come back.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.452
We'll have a good sit-down.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.296
Because I'm warning you now,

18:22.330 --> 18:24.389
Florrick-Agos isn't
up to this case.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.591
It's really too bad.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.733
Are you talking to me?

18:33.780 --> 18:34.872
Yes.

18:34.910 --> 18:36.730
It's too bad
about Will.

18:36.780 --> 18:40.409
He's still in pain.

18:40.450 --> 18:43.283
I'm David Lee,
by the way.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.309
I'm Isabel.

18:44.350 --> 18:46.284
Hmm.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.355
Want a pretzel?

18:47.390 --> 18:50.484
No, thank you.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.623
He's still in pain
about Alicia.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.367
And who's Alicia?

18:57.400 --> 19:01.496
Oh, someone who...

19:01.540 --> 19:02.837
used to work here.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.861
He could tell you more.

19:05.910 --> 19:07.901
(chuckles)

19:14.550 --> 19:16.939
I'm looking for Tomas Ruiz.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.743
He's not here.

19:18.790 --> 19:20.712
I'm working as
a skip tracer.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.216
If you help us find him,

19:22.260 --> 19:24.319
there will be a percentage
of the bond for you.

19:26.360 --> 19:30.968
He's not here, but he had a
girlfriend-- Christina Stewart.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.935
Do you have her address?

19:33.970 --> 19:36.461
MARILYN:
Your wife would not agree
to set any rules.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.434
She said if you wanted to come
see her at her new firm,

19:38.470 --> 19:39.732
she would welcome it,
but...

19:39.770 --> 19:41.271
(rustling)

19:41.310 --> 19:42.277
(clears throat)

19:42.310 --> 19:43.299
Sorry.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.703
She would not
police her firm.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.479
It would be our advice
to steer clear

19:46.510 --> 19:48.410
until her firm
establishes itself.

19:48.450 --> 19:49.917
No, I'm, I'm going
tonight, thanks.

19:49.950 --> 19:52.817
Um, anything else?

19:52.850 --> 19:55.557
Um, yes, we've, um,
we've gone to the trouble

19:55.590 --> 19:58.252
of canceling your speech to
the Minority Voter Council.

19:58.290 --> 20:00.758
Oh, no, we've decided
to keep that.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.620
(sighs)
I'm sorry, what?

20:02.660 --> 20:06.266
It's worth our effort to do
a redistricting speech.

20:06.300 --> 20:07.665
(sighs)

20:09.340 --> 20:11.308
Marilyn.

20:11.340 --> 20:15.709
Eli, I thought we decided
it would hurt the governor

20:15.740 --> 20:17.776
to come down on one
Side or the other.

20:17.810 --> 20:20.847
Yes, I've changed my mind.

20:23.650 --> 20:27.450
Okay, so I guess
I'm giving a speech.

20:27.490 --> 20:29.458
Eli, what is going on?

20:29.490 --> 20:30.388
I changed my mind.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.352
Have you never
changed your mind?
No.

20:32.390 --> 20:34.392
Well, this is what
it looks like.

20:43.570 --> 20:45.561
Yeah?

20:45.610 --> 20:46.702
I'm looking for Tomas.

20:46.740 --> 20:48.537
I don't know anybody
named Tomas.

20:50.450 --> 20:54.568
You can tell him for me that
Gloria is looking for him.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.713
I told you,
I don't know him.

20:56.750 --> 21:00.618
You can tell him that Illinois
has laws about child support,

21:00.660 --> 21:03.584
and he'd better pay.

21:06.590 --> 21:07.898
(engine rewing)

21:07.930 --> 21:09.921
(tires screeching)

21:18.640 --> 21:20.301
Open the door,
you son of a bitch!

21:20.340 --> 21:21.534
TOMAS:
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
(banging on door)

21:21.580 --> 21:24.799
You got a kid, and you didn't
tell me about it?!
What?

21:24.850 --> 21:26.909
I have to hear
about it from some

21:26.950 --> 21:29.612
blonde skank who showed up
at my doorstep.
Hello, Tomas.

21:31.620 --> 21:33.087
REARDON:
So, you're saying the
U.S. Attorney is in breach?

21:33.120 --> 21:34.519
Yes, Your Honor.
They made an agreement,

21:34.560 --> 21:35.686
and they didn't honor it.

21:35.720 --> 21:36.948
We honored every part
of our agreement,

21:36.990 --> 21:38.321
except the granting of the visa.

21:38.360 --> 21:39.429
That's the only part
that matters!

21:39.460 --> 21:41.496
Because Mr. Ruiz
did not comply

21:41.530 --> 21:42.690
with his duties
under the agreement.

21:42.730 --> 21:43.890
Your Honor,
they created the danger

21:43.930 --> 21:45.727
by asking him
to testify.

21:45.770 --> 21:46.998
But when he was denied
that chance,

21:47.030 --> 21:48.668
through no fault of his own,
(phone buzzes)

21:48.700 --> 21:49.928
they let him be sent
right into the lion's mouth!

21:49.970 --> 21:51.608
And he'll be there

21:51.640 --> 21:52.732
in ten hours.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.635
So really,
it's an equitable argument.

21:54.680 --> 21:55.829
Robyn, what have you got?

21:55.880 --> 21:57.802
The other Tomas Ruiz.

21:57.850 --> 22:01.718
What do you mean?

22:01.750 --> 22:03.547
I found the
other Tomas Ruiz.

22:03.590 --> 22:04.739
You did? (laughs)

22:04.790 --> 22:05.745
In two hours?

22:05.790 --> 22:06.939
Yes.

22:06.990 --> 22:09.049
Uh, will he testify?

22:09.090 --> 22:10.887
Well, he wants something
in return.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.448
Ten grand.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.422
Get him in here,
and we'll work it out.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.664
Oh, and, Robyn,

22:18.700 --> 22:21.828
goodjob.

22:21.870 --> 22:24.509
The problem, Mrs. Florrick,
is, your client is coming

22:24.540 --> 22:26.428
to a court of equity
with unclean hands,

22:26.470 --> 22:28.836
which, as I'm sure you will
remember from law school,

22:28.880 --> 22:30.074
you're not allowed to do.

22:30.110 --> 22:31.008
Your Honor, excuse me.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.142
We'd like to amend our argument.

22:32.180 --> 22:34.614
We've found the
real Tomas Ruiz.

22:34.650 --> 22:36.675
The real...? Who, now?
Our client was

22:36.720 --> 22:37.744
mistakenly deported

22:37.790 --> 22:38.882
because immigration confused him
with someone else.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.411
We've located the man
they were actually looking for.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.916
Well, that's a bit
of a sticky wicket,

22:42.960 --> 22:45.520
seeing as how your client's
already on the transport.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.097
Yes, Your Honor, which is why
time is of the essence here.

22:48.130 --> 22:48.994
Yes, but unfortunately,

22:49.030 --> 22:51.089
I'm not empowered
to hear that claim.

22:51.130 --> 22:53.166
Only the Board
of Immigration Appeals is.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.839
And I'd hurry.

22:57.940 --> 23:00.670
(horn honking, siren blaring)

23:00.710 --> 23:02.405
The problem is, Mrs. Florrick,
the transport's already left.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.579
Yes, but the wrong man
is on the bus,

23:04.610 --> 23:06.043
Your Honor.
No, Your Honor.
There's no dispute

23:06.080 --> 23:08.048
that Tomas Y. Ruiz
was in this country

23:08.080 --> 23:10.071
illegally, and therefore,
subject to deportation.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.088
Yes, but not expedited
deportation.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.985
I'm afraid that's a distinction
for earlier.

23:14.020 --> 23:16.056
Prior to the transport's
departure.

23:16.090 --> 23:18.979
We can't waste taxpayer money
turning a bus around

23:19.030 --> 23:20.725
to bring someone back
who's just going

23:20.760 --> 23:22.489
to be deported again
in a few months.

23:22.530 --> 23:23.690
This isn't about deportation.

23:23.730 --> 23:26.597
Our client faces grave danger
the second he gets to Mexico.

23:26.630 --> 23:28.962
Even if that's true, Your Honor,
that's an asylum claim.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.865
Let me guess.
You don't hear asylum claims?

23:30.910 --> 23:32.537
That's correct, Mrs. Florrick.
We don't hear

23:32.570 --> 23:33.776
asylum claims.

23:33.810 --> 23:35.869
We only hear appeals
of asylum claims.

23:35.910 --> 23:38.447
The initial claim has to be
brought to an immigration judge.

23:42.950 --> 23:44.144
(phone rings)

23:44.190 --> 23:47.785
I told you
to cancel everything...

23:47.820 --> 23:50.084
Oh, uh, no. Send her in.

23:54.030 --> 23:56.021
(clears his throat)

23:58.870 --> 24:00.861
(sighs)

24:03.970 --> 24:04.937
Hi.

24:04.970 --> 24:05.902
Hi.

24:05.940 --> 24:07.908
I'm sorry to drop in unexpected.

24:07.940 --> 24:09.976
Please, please.
No, uh, would you...?

24:10.010 --> 24:12.899
No, I... I can't stay very long.
I have to get to court.

24:12.950 --> 24:14.144
But I wanted to apologize.

24:14.180 --> 24:15.545
For...?

24:15.580 --> 24:17.787
For dinner
last night, or

24:17.820 --> 24:19.549
not-dinner last night.

24:19.590 --> 24:20.909
For running out on you.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.985
You didn't run on me.
I'm afraid I did.

24:23.020 --> 24:25.056
But it was for a
good cause, and,

24:25.090 --> 24:26.978
anyway, uh,

24:27.030 --> 24:30.522
I have to run out on you again
right now, but I

24:30.570 --> 24:32.629
would love it if we
had dinner next time?

24:32.670 --> 24:33.796
That would be great.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.091
Ne-_Next time
you're in town, yeah.

24:38.140 --> 24:41.803
Oh, and, um... here.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.876
I got you dried apricots.

24:43.910 --> 24:45.172
I don't know why.

24:45.210 --> 24:47.269
I... I thought of you
with dried apricots.

24:47.310 --> 24:49.016
(phone rings)

24:49.050 --> 24:51.587
Okay. Um, I'll

24:51.620 --> 24:53.656
talk to you later.

25:02.130 --> 25:05.019
Natalie, wait!

25:05.070 --> 25:07.026
(sighs)

25:07.070 --> 25:09.664
We have to have dinner tonight,
or it'll never happen.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.167
Really? Why is that?

25:11.210 --> 25:13.064
_ I don't know. _ _
I just have a premonition

25:13.110 --> 25:15.237
that we_both le_ad
very complicated lives...

25:15.280 --> 25:17.032
Mr. Gold?
Not now!

25:17.080 --> 25:18.968
If we don't
take advantage

25:19.010 --> 25:21.069
of these few minutes we have,

25:21.120 --> 25:23.042
we might never get
the chance again.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.742
I'll make a reservation.

25:25.790 --> 25:27.018
I don't normally do this.

25:27.050 --> 25:28.915
What?
Run after people.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.689
_ I'm not
a running-after-people sort.

25:30.730 --> 25:31.879
And I

25:31.930 --> 25:33.898
don't normally buy
dried apricots.

25:33.930 --> 25:36.797
They were just in the store
downstairs, so I bought them.

25:36.830 --> 25:38.161
(laughs)
Throw them away.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.691
Okay? They're probably gross.

25:40.740 --> 25:41.991
ELI:
So, you'll call
me about where?

25:42.040 --> 25:43.234
NATALIE:
I will.

25:49.110 --> 25:50.668
How you doing?

25:50.710 --> 25:52.701
Good.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.614
Who's Alicia?

26:03.660 --> 26:05.628
What?

26:05.660 --> 26:07.628
Who's Alicia?

26:07.660 --> 26:10.026
Someone thinks you're
in pain over Alicia,

26:10.060 --> 26:12.062
and that's what I'm about.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.168
Why are you about anything?

26:16.200 --> 26:18.168
I don't know.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.007
I didn't think I was.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.337
Who someone?
Who's telling you this?

26:21.380 --> 26:23.701
David... something.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.274
He looks like a
jack-o'-lantern.

26:25.310 --> 26:26.846
David Lee.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.643
I don't know.
One of your lawyers.

26:28.680 --> 26:30.739
He doesn't like you
in my office.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.382
He wants to poison the stream.

26:32.420 --> 26:34.183
So, who is she?

26:34.220 --> 26:36.950
Alicia was an employee

26:36.990 --> 26:39.049
who left to start her own firm.

26:39.090 --> 26:40.352
You were sleeping with her?

26:40.390 --> 26:42.358
For a while.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.061
Then what?

26:44.100 --> 26:46.091
What happened
after a while?

26:49.070 --> 26:51.209
I don't know.

26:53.340 --> 26:55.331
Was she good?

26:58.110 --> 27:00.874
Are we having fun?

27:00.920 --> 27:02.979
You tell me.

27:05.990 --> 27:08.254
You taste like chocolate.

27:08.290 --> 27:10.087
That's because I'm made
of chocolate. (gasps)

27:10.120 --> 27:11.781
DOLAN:
Your Honor,

27:11.830 --> 27:13.923
only someone facing
a recognized form

27:13.960 --> 27:16.724
of persecution can file
a claim for asylum.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.261
Which Tomas Ruiz
is, Your Honor.

27:18.300 --> 27:19.790
Oh, really?
Which one? Race?

27:19.830 --> 27:21.195
Religion? Nationality?
Politics?

27:21.240 --> 27:23.162
Social group.
He's part of a social group

27:23.200 --> 27:24.701
that is known_
to face persecution

27:24.740 --> 27:26.230
in many parts of Mexico.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.977
And what social group
would that be?
Snitches, Your Honor.

27:29.010 --> 27:30.944
Oh, come on.
CARY:
This is an affidavit

27:30.980 --> 27:33.107
from a Professor
of Mexican Cultural Studies

27:33.150 --> 27:35.846
testifying that large portions
of Mexico are controlled

27:35.880 --> 27:37.108
by drug cartels

27:37.150 --> 27:38.947
who deal violently...
DOLAN:
And I am sure

27:38.990 --> 27:41.208
it's fascinating,
but the simple fact is,

27:41.260 --> 27:43.455
Tomas Ruiz is not,
actually, a snitch,

27:43.490 --> 27:45.253
because he never
actually snitched.

27:45.290 --> 27:46.222
Your Honor, that's sophistry.

27:46.260 --> 27:47.693
Yes, Mrs. Florrick.

27:47.730 --> 27:50.119
Even if snitches qualify
as a social group,

27:50.160 --> 27:54.267
you haven't demonstrated that
Mr. Ruiz meets the criteria.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.689
ALICIA:
Your Honor, we have seven
and a half hours before Mr. Ruiz

27:56.740 --> 27:57.968
is in Mexico.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.137
JUDGE:
Yes, but, as
Bob Dylan said,

28:00.170 --> 28:02.206
"Couldn't help but make me
feel ashamed..."

28:02.240 --> 28:03.172
Hello?

28:03.210 --> 28:04.347
Natalie, it's Will Gardner.

28:04.380 --> 28:05.745
I wonder if you remember me?

28:05.780 --> 28:07.975
I'm one of the partners
at Lockhart/Gardner.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.146
Uh, yes, I remember.

28:09.180 --> 28:10.784
I have to apologize
for yesterday.

28:10.820 --> 28:12.185
I didn't realize
you had dropped by.

28:12.220 --> 28:14.188
And I know you've gone somewhere
else with your case.

28:14.220 --> 28:14.982
Yes, Florrick-Agos.

28:15.020 --> 28:17.488
But I wanted you
to know I reviewed

28:17.520 --> 28:19.329
all Tomas Ruiz's materials,

28:19.360 --> 28:21.225
and if you're ever looking
for another perspective,

28:21.260 --> 28:22.727
please don't hesitate to call.

28:22.760 --> 28:25.194
(indistinct chatter)

28:25.230 --> 28:27.391
Thank you for calling,
Mr. Gardner,

28:27.430 --> 28:29.193
but, um, I didn't have the best

28:29.240 --> 28:31.208
experience at your office.
I know.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.969
I understand that,
and I'm very sorry.

28:33.010 --> 28:34.170
Howard Lyman is

28:34.210 --> 28:35.802
one of our legacy partners,

28:35.840 --> 28:37.808
and he would very
much like to apologize

28:37.850 --> 28:39.374
for his comments.

28:39.410 --> 28:42.379
Please, Natalie, just drop by,
let us talk to you.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.149
Let me think about it.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.441
Good.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.139
That's all I ask.

28:47.190 --> 28:48.885
Thank you. Good-bye.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.057
(phone beeps off)

28:50.090 --> 28:50.920
(laughs)
Mmm. You're good luck.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.780
You know that?
I do know that.

28:52.830 --> 28:54.229
(moaning)

28:54.260 --> 28:56.399
Lesbian, gay or transgender?

28:56.430 --> 28:58.091
Only if he's in danger
because of it.

28:58.130 --> 28:59.529
What about governmental
persecution?

28:59.570 --> 29:00.969
You mean, his political beliefs?

29:01.000 --> 29:02.194
CARY:
Or we just argue

29:02.240 --> 29:03.468
that the Mexican government
can't protect him.

29:03.500 --> 29:05.229
They're not the ones
threatening him.

29:05.270 --> 29:07.135
I served Dolan.
We're back in court in an hour.

29:07.170 --> 29:08.307
Great. Now we just need
something to argue.

29:08.340 --> 29:09.830
CAREY:
Blood feud.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.347
You could argue
there's a blood feud

29:11.380 --> 29:13.143
between Tomas' family
and Hierra's family.

29:13.180 --> 29:14.841
ALICIA:
But we don't have any evidence
of it, do we?

29:14.880 --> 29:16.074
We might.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.145
Really? What?

29:21.520 --> 29:23.408
Robyn, what?

29:24.430 --> 29:26.455
Have you noticed that
everyone's changing?

29:26.490 --> 29:28.458
Yeah.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.252
So, what's up?

29:30.300 --> 29:31.824
I'm concerned about Eli.

29:31.870 --> 29:33.019
(laughs)

29:33.070 --> 29:34.264
What is it this time?

29:34.300 --> 29:35.335
He flip-flopped

29:35.370 --> 29:37.235
on your speaking at the Minority
Voter Conference.

29:37.270 --> 29:38.532
Well, you know,
one of the things

29:38.570 --> 29:42.131
I value about Eli is
that he keeps an open mind,

29:42.180 --> 29:44.171
which means that
he sometimes changes it.

29:44.210 --> 29:45.279
I think he might

29:45.310 --> 29:47.540
have changed it because
of someone else's influence.

29:47.580 --> 29:50.048
Her name is Natalie Flores.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.082
She works for a lobbying firm.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.587
Are you saying

29:53.620 --> 29:56.953
that you think Eli's
on the payroll of some lobbyist?

29:56.990 --> 29:58.423
No, I think it's personal.

29:58.460 --> 30:00.121
(sighs)

30:00.160 --> 30:02.253
Are you all right?

30:02.300 --> 30:04.518
(gasps, sighs)

30:06.100 --> 30:07.590
I'm fine. I'm sorry.

30:07.630 --> 30:09.029
I hate being weak.

30:09.070 --> 30:10.389
You're not being weak.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.499
Mm.

30:12.540 --> 30:14.531
Can I get you
something, or...?

30:14.580 --> 30:16.901
Ooh. Uh...

30:16.940 --> 30:19.443
Oh, I'm out of my Pop-Tarts.

30:19.480 --> 30:20.970
That's not good.

30:21.020 --> 30:24.046
No, it's not.
Um...

30:24.090 --> 30:26.411
Natalie Flores?

30:26.450 --> 30:28.350
Uh, yes, yes, right. Um...

30:28.390 --> 30:30.119
(clears her throat)

30:30.160 --> 30:32.583
Well, just to be clear,
if Eli's directing policy

30:32.630 --> 30:34.393
due to somebody's
outside influence,

30:34.430 --> 30:37.297
then, that's a potential
ethical violation there.

30:37.330 --> 30:39.298
Yes. I understand.

30:39.330 --> 30:41.469
And I'm gonna look into it.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.298
Okay. Thank you.

30:46.340 --> 30:48.376
(dog barking)

30:55.320 --> 30:57.015
(doorbell buzzes)

31:05.230 --> 31:06.629
(gasps)

31:11.670 --> 31:13.524
I was complimenting her.

31:13.570 --> 31:15.390
Didn't ask her
to clean my office.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.433
I just think
this one is... touchy.

31:20.470 --> 31:21.937
This one?

31:21.980 --> 31:23.504
This... this Natalie.

31:23.540 --> 31:25.542
Maybe she's a lesbian.

31:25.580 --> 31:27.207
I don't think she's a lesbian.

31:27.250 --> 31:30.378
DIANE:
But she is our link to
a potentially valuable client.

31:30.420 --> 31:32.445
Howard, we're going to need you
to apologize immediately.

31:32.490 --> 31:34.219
Fine.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.353
Well, what do you want me
to say?

31:36.390 --> 31:40.156
I think it's important
for Natalie to understand

31:40.190 --> 31:43.353
that, you know, you see her
as intelligent and capable.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.129
Not just some spicy tamale?

31:45.170 --> 31:46.228
Hmm? Oh, come on.

31:46.270 --> 31:47.567
I'm just kidding.
Kidding

31:47.600 --> 31:49.363
is what got us into this mess.
No,

31:49.400 --> 31:51.630
political correctness got us
into this mess.

31:51.670 --> 31:53.604
But I'll get
us out of it.

31:55.310 --> 31:56.937
I don't think
I'm gonna do the speech

31:56.980 --> 31:59.972
at the Minority
Voter Conference.

32:00.010 --> 32:02.319
You aren't?

32:02.350 --> 32:03.578
Redistricting cuts both ways.

32:03.620 --> 32:07.249
I don't want to be accused of
supporting ghettoizing anyone.

32:07.290 --> 32:09.087
You aren't ghettoizing anyone.
They want this.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.350
A lot of people want
a lot of things.

32:11.390 --> 32:13.358
Yes, but we've already RSVP'd
and...

32:18.330 --> 32:20.264
And what?

32:23.300 --> 32:27.339
Why is this suddenly so
important that I do this, Eli?

32:27.370 --> 32:31.204
Because this redistricting
amendment has legs.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.342
No.

32:32.380 --> 32:34.439
What changed your mind?

32:35.480 --> 32:37.118
Eli,

32:37.150 --> 32:41.189
I need to know
that I can trust you.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.280
I need to know
that the advice you give me

32:44.330 --> 32:45.683
is in my best interests.

32:45.730 --> 32:47.584
It has never been anything but.

32:48.630 --> 32:51.599
Good.

32:51.630 --> 32:53.769
(sighs)

32:53.800 --> 32:56.769
As long as you don't
let anyone use you.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.360
Or me.

33:01.610 --> 33:02.702
The next time you want
to correct

33:02.740 --> 33:05.345
my behavior,
come to me.
What are you talking about?

33:05.380 --> 33:06.540
I don't know what you think
you saw, but if you're trying

33:06.580 --> 33:07.501
to score points with Peter...
I'm not

33:07.550 --> 33:09.279
trying to score points.
Then why bring it up?

33:09.320 --> 33:10.742
Because it's my job.
My private life

33:10.780 --> 33:12.418
falls way outside
your job description.

33:12.450 --> 33:14.384
Not when it impacts the counsel
you give the governor.

33:14.420 --> 33:16.308
Let's get something straight:
I have been with Peter

33:16.360 --> 33:17.657
since...
(gags)

33:17.690 --> 33:19.783
I'm sorry.
I can't do this right now.

33:19.830 --> 33:23.049
Oh, spare me
the rigors of pregnancy BS!

33:23.100 --> 33:24.328
ALICIA:
Your Honor,

33:24.370 --> 33:27.464
blood feuds are
a recognized ground for asylum.
DOLAN: Yes,

33:27.500 --> 33:28.432
in places where they exist.

33:28.470 --> 33:31.234
Albania, for example,
the Caucasus, Sicily...

33:31.270 --> 33:34.433
The concept applies anywhere
someone is targeted

33:34.480 --> 33:36.334
because of bad blood
between families.

33:36.380 --> 33:38.245
In this case,
Lalo Hierra

33:38.280 --> 33:41.613
and his family have a grudge
against Tomas Ruiz.
No.

33:41.650 --> 33:43.538
They don't hate him because
his name is Tomas Ruiz.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.081
They hate him because he...

33:47.350 --> 33:48.556
...almost snitched.

33:48.590 --> 33:49.716
(sighs)

33:49.760 --> 33:50.579
Besides, Your Honor,

33:50.620 --> 33:52.520
even if they could
argue blood feud,

33:52.560 --> 33:53.379
where's the evidence?

33:53.430 --> 33:54.522
Right here.
(chuckles)

33:54.560 --> 33:55.595
What a surprise.
Now what?

33:55.630 --> 33:58.463
Just this morning,
Mrs. Ruiz received this bullet

33:58.500 --> 34:02.698
in her mailbox, with the letters
"L.C." written on the side.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.537
That's Lalo Hierra's calling
card. It's a clear threat.

34:04.570 --> 34:06.367
Hold on. We have no way
to verify...
Your Honor,

34:06.410 --> 34:09.402
as soon as this was_
brought to our attention
we brought it to you.

34:09.440 --> 34:10.202
Okay, enough.

34:10.240 --> 34:12.606
Mrs. Florrick, Mr. Agos,
I'm sorry,

34:12.650 --> 34:15.471
but blood feud
is a very specific claim,

34:15.520 --> 34:17.476
and I'm just not
seeing enough here

34:17.520 --> 34:20.080
to support it.
Your Honor, this bullet
is clearly a warning

34:20.120 --> 34:22.611
of violence to come
to Mrs. Ruiz and her family.

34:24.530 --> 34:28.193
but _it is_ relevant _
to an application for a T Visa.

34:28.230 --> 34:29.527
T visa?
Yes.

34:29.560 --> 34:31.391
The Ruiz family has been
the victim

34:31.430 --> 34:34.160
of a crime,
witness intimidation.

34:34.200 --> 34:37.328
That is one of the recognized
grounds for granting a T visa.

34:37.370 --> 34:38.803
Your Honor, this is absurd.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.831
Hold on, Mr. Dolan.

34:43.510 --> 34:46.308
"And someone says,

34:46.350 --> 34:48.568
"'You're in the wrong place,
my friend.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.679
You better leave.'"

34:50.720 --> 34:52.312
Bob Dylan again, Your Honor?

34:53.450 --> 34:57.181
It's a good claim,
Mrs. Florrick.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.780
Actually, it's an excellent
claim, but unfortunately

34:59.830 --> 35:02.526
I can't consider
a Visa application.

35:02.560 --> 35:05.529
Your Honor, Mr. Ruiz's bus
is going to reach the border

35:05.570 --> 35:08.164
in less than two hours.
I understand, but
you need to see

35:08.200 --> 35:09.758
an immigration case worker
for that.

35:14.510 --> 35:15.738
And the chain of custody?

35:15.780 --> 35:18.442
CARY:
As soon as she received
the bullet, Mrs. Ruiz called me.

35:18.480 --> 35:20.641
I rushed over
and took possession of it.

35:20.680 --> 35:24.480
Even so, I can only get to a T
visa for Mrs. Ruiz and her son.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.818
They were the ones who were
the victims of intimidation.

35:26.850 --> 35:29.887
Yes, but it was meant as
a warning for the entire family.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.559
Perhaps. But by the time
the bullet was delivered,

35:32.590 --> 35:34.490
Mr. Ruiz was already out
of the state.

35:34.530 --> 35:37.294
Look, Mrs....
Bardos, but Estelle is fine.

35:37.330 --> 35:40.163
Estelle, any minute now that bus
is gonna cross the border

35:40.200 --> 35:41.838
into Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.

35:41.870 --> 35:44.430
Our client won't make _it
a mile past the checkpomt.

35:44.470 --> 35:45.903
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Florrick,

35:45.940 --> 35:47.760
I truly am, but we have rules.

35:47.810 --> 35:49.175
CARY:
Rules? Really?

35:49.210 --> 35:50.802
Let me tell you something, lady,
your rules

35:50.840 --> 35:52.671
are right
out of 1984.

35:52.710 --> 35:53.904
The book, not the year.

35:54.950 --> 35:57.214
I am sorry.

36:05.660 --> 36:06.820
Hello, Mr. Gardner?

36:06.860 --> 36:08.725
I would like to meet.

36:15.970 --> 36:18.768
Natalie, how good
to see you again.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.402
Mr. Lyman. How are you?

36:20.440 --> 36:21.532
Fine, thank you.

36:21.580 --> 36:24.469
Natalie, thank you for giving
L.G. a second chance.

36:24.510 --> 36:27.206
Yes, and I'd like to apologize
for our last meeting.

36:27.250 --> 36:29.275
I was a little distracted
by the news

36:29.320 --> 36:30.947
of a dear friend of mine dying.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.641
I'm sorry.

36:32.690 --> 36:34.851
It's fine.
But I wanted to be clear

36:34.890 --> 36:36.710
that, uh... how wrong I was

36:36.760 --> 36:38.625
in my comments
the last time.
(elevator dings)

36:38.660 --> 36:41.823
Think nothing of it. Oh,
uh, I'd like to introduce you

36:41.860 --> 36:44.294
to the partner at
our lobbying firm,

36:44.330 --> 36:46.696
Joe Pallotta.
Hey, hey, man.

36:46.730 --> 36:48.732
How's it going?

36:56.780 --> 36:58.805
No, the transport is stopped
at the border,

36:58.850 --> 37:00.875
but they're about to release it.
Why? Is...

37:00.910 --> 37:02.446
is there a problem?
For me?

37:02.480 --> 37:06.587
No. For the government
of Mexico, possibly.

37:06.620 --> 37:07.746
This is immigration
enforcement's

37:07.790 --> 37:09.815
expedited
deportation list.

37:09.860 --> 37:13.352
And you can see,
Tomas I. Ruiz is on that bus.

37:13.390 --> 37:16.427
He's one of the most infamous
con men in the U.S.,

37:16.460 --> 37:19.566
responsible for millions
of dollars in damages.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.022
He specializes in airbag fraud.

37:21.070 --> 37:24.528
Airbag fraud?
Not only
does he cheat people,

37:24.570 --> 37:25.867
but if they get
into an accident,

37:25.910 --> 37:27.559
they don't have
a functioning airbag.

37:27.610 --> 37:29.498
And given Mexico's
traffic safety record,

37:29.540 --> 37:31.405
I'm sure that would be
troubling.

37:31.450 --> 37:32.872
But rather than deal
with the problem here,

37:32.910 --> 37:34.946
the U.S. government decided
to pass the buck

37:34.980 --> 37:37.278
by sending him back to you.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.811
Of course, it is always
within the discretion

37:39.850 --> 37:41.954
of any sovereign nation
whether or not they choose

37:41.990 --> 37:44.879
to accept a deportee
back into their country.

37:49.860 --> 37:52.420
They turned him away
at the border.
(gasps)

37:52.470 --> 37:54.893
Oh, my God. Thank you.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.864
(sniffles)
Thank you.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.936
Daddy's gonna be okay.

37:59.970 --> 38:02.973
(speaking indistinctly)

38:03.010 --> 38:04.841
Feeling good?

38:04.880 --> 38:06.848
I guess.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.348
You should be. You pulled
it out of the fire for us.

38:09.380 --> 38:11.689
Well, it's my job.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.881
Yeah. It is.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.911
Keep doing it.

38:19.090 --> 38:20.580
NATALIE:
Wait, his own country

38:20.630 --> 38:21.824
wouldn't let him in?

38:21.860 --> 38:24.658
Somehow, he ended up on the
Mexican Consulate watch list.

38:24.700 --> 38:25.997
Oh, thank God.

38:26.030 --> 38:27.827
Alicia, thank you.

38:27.870 --> 38:29.565
Just remember to tell
all your fee-paying friends

38:29.600 --> 38:32.569
about us.
(chuckles)
Bye.

38:32.610 --> 38:37.035
Excuse me. Um, I'd like
to order two glasses of this.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.968
Thanks.

38:39.010 --> 38:41.444
(phone rings)

38:41.480 --> 38:44.449
You'd be wise to get here fast.

38:44.490 --> 38:47.789
I'm in a great mood and I have
a corporate credit card.

38:47.820 --> 38:49.117
ELI:
Natalie, hi.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.481
Hi. You sound...

38:51.530 --> 38:52.929
something.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.520
It's just that I'm not gonna
be able to make it.

38:55.560 --> 38:58.120
It's work, naturally.

38:58.160 --> 39:01.391
_ Peter's decision to cancel
his speech is wreaking havoc.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.000
We have... legislators
from minority districts

39:04.040 --> 39:05.462
at our door with pitchforks.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.603
And you're the last line
of defense.

39:07.640 --> 39:10.404
I'm sorry, Natalie.

39:10.440 --> 39:14.046
Peter needs me.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.945
He's luclq to have you.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.511
Fly safe.

39:36.140 --> 39:38.131
(sighs)

39:41.680 --> 39:42.931
That was just me being stupid.

39:44.610 --> 39:46.942
Eli, if this is
too complicated...
No. No, it's not.

39:46.980 --> 39:49.949
Look, I lie 24/7 for my job--
it's actually a gift--

39:49.980 --> 39:52.744
but lying to you
gave me a stomachache.

39:52.790 --> 39:54.485
S-So. ..

39:56.520 --> 39:59.648
How were the dried apricots?

40:00.690 --> 40:02.999
Not so good.
(chuckles)

40:03.030 --> 40:04.998
Well, maybe next time

40:05.030 --> 40:07.669
I'll...

40:12.110 --> 40:15.102
I just had to do that.

40:23.620 --> 40:26.043
(piano playing intro
to "All I Have to Do Is Dream")

40:26.090 --> 40:28.957
* When I want you

40:28.990 --> 40:31.550
* In my arms

40:31.590 --> 40:33.922
* When I want you

40:33.960 --> 40:36.451
* And all your charms

40:36.500 --> 40:39.469
* Whenever I want you

40:39.500 --> 40:45.006
* All I have to do is dream

40:45.040 --> 40:47.861
(elevator door opens)

40:47.910 --> 40:50.902
PETER:
Well, Marilyn, I hope I didn't
make any ethical infractions

40:50.940 --> 40:54.239
on the elevator ride.
No, you pushed the button
with dignity and honor.

40:54.280 --> 40:57.044
PETER:
Ah, you must be
a good influence on me.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.581
I wanted to push
all the buttons

40:58.620 --> 41:00.918
and stop on
every floor. Hey.

41:00.950 --> 41:02.656
These are some digs.

41:02.690 --> 41:05.579
Uh, I think the operative word
is "cheap."

41:05.630 --> 41:06.881
Nice to see you again, Marilyn.

41:06.930 --> 41:09.990
You, too.
Okay. Where on the unethical
spectrum does it fall

41:10.030 --> 41:12.123
to have _an intern
help my Wife unpack?

41:12.170 --> 41:13.819
MARILYN:
Well, technically
in the red zone,

41:13.870 --> 41:16.134
but we'll _note it
as a goodWIll gesture

41:16.170 --> 41:18.058
by the governor
to a citizen.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.260
Well, thank you.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.505
Guys.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.540
Thank you for dropping by,
Mr. Governor.

41:24.580 --> 41:27.947
No problem,
Mrs. First Lady.

41:27.980 --> 41:29.811
You know what?

41:29.850 --> 41:32.819
I think you're gonna take over
the world from here.

41:34.690 --> 41:36.681
You think so?

41:37.720 --> 41:39.722
I'd bet on it.
