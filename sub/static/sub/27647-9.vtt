to going through and pushing

19:19.610 --> 19:21.312
ourselves to the max

19:21.345 --> 19:24.515

I wasn't very comfortable

19:24.548 --> 19:27.885
jumping out of a plane
but I had faith and I did it

19:27.918 --> 19:30.921

when I look back.

19:57.481 --> 19:59.149
especially heading
into tonight,

while I can be the first

20:01.952 --> 20:04.555
or make a joke
about me being a virgin,

20:04.588 --> 20:07.057
I know for a fact that

20:07.091 --> 20:09.927
there's a lot
of important parts

20:09.960 --> 20:11.428
of a relationship.
- Mm-hmm.

20:11.462 --> 20:13.597
- And sex is part of it.

20:13.631 --> 20:16.467
- We all have

20:16.500 --> 20:19.970
our own ideas of intimacy
and physical connection

20:20.004 --> 20:23.908
and when we should or shouldn't
be ready and all that.

20:23.941 --> 20:27.211
I don't think you know
that I actually waited

20:27.244 --> 20:28.646
to have sex,

20:28.679 --> 20:31.715
and my husband was the
first person I had sex with.

20:31.749 --> 20:34.451
So I understand the value

20:34.485 --> 20:36.820
in waiting
until you feel comfortable

20:36.854 --> 20:39.089
and sharing it with someone
that you feel special with.

20:39.123 --> 20:41.926
So I see the importance
behind it all,

20:41.959 --> 20:45.229
and it is a big part of you.
It's a big part of me as well.

20:45.262 --> 20:48.432
But at the same time,
the reason why intimacy

20:48.465 --> 20:53.137
and, I believe,
truth is such a big part

20:53.170 --> 20:55.539
of a relationship

20:55.573 --> 20:57.675
and why I hold it
to a high regard

20:57.708 --> 21:00.644
is because, um...

21:00.678 --> 21:05.716
about a year and a half
into my marriage,

21:05.749 --> 21:08.285
my husband actually

21:08.319 --> 21:12.456
went outside
of our marriage and...

21:12.489 --> 21:14.692
cheated on me.

21:14.725 --> 21:18.062
It's something
I was ashamed of.

21:18.095 --> 21:20.664
But...

21:20.698 --> 21:23.400
I mean, it's caused me
to know my self-worth

21:23.434 --> 21:25.703
because I've been through,
like, the hardest part

21:25.736 --> 21:29.573
of a relationship,
and I've turned that around

21:29.607 --> 21:33.777
to fuel my future relationships
and know that

21:33.811 --> 21:38.482
I value intimacy a lot
and truth and marriage.

21:38.515 --> 21:40.985
- Yeah.
- So...

21:41.018 --> 21:43.287

21:43.320 --> 21:46.156
that it's hard for you
to open up

21:46.190 --> 21:48.192
about that kind of stuff
because it's hard for me too.

21:48.225 --> 21:49.259
- Yeah.
- But I definitely think

21:49.293 --> 21:50.894
it's something
that we can bond over,

21:50.928 --> 21:54.498
and kind of understand
each other a little bit more.

21:54.531 --> 21:55.699
- Right.

21:55.733 --> 21:58.268
Just hearing
what you've gone through...

21:58.302 --> 22:00.838
- Mm-hmm.
- And knowing who you are today

22:00.871 --> 22:04.508
I'm blown away
by the person you are

22:04.541 --> 22:06.910
because there's not
a lot of women

22:06.944 --> 22:10.080
that can do what you do

22:10.114 --> 22:12.716
and have such
a positive outlook.

22:12.750 --> 22:15.319
- I think that's why it blows
my mind when you say that--

22:15.352 --> 22:17.388
those things about me
because I think back

22:17.421 --> 22:19.923
to about a year and a half ago
and I'm just like,

22:19.957 --> 22:21.759
"That was not
the person I was,"

22:21.792 --> 22:24.161

able to overcome all that.

like them...

your conversations with them.

40:32.315 --> 40:34.417

40:34.450 --> 40:36.185

40:36.219 --> 40:37.420

I think your dad's
conversation, for me at least,

41:00.409 --> 41:02.545

- Me too.

41:02.578 --> 41:04.947
- In the best ways.

41:04.981 --> 41:07.216
- His was definitely
the hardest for me too, though.

41:07.250 --> 41:08.551

- What's the hardest part

41:08.584 --> 41:12.121
for him, in your opinion,
about all this

41:12.155 --> 41:14.957
for him to understand?

41:14.991 --> 41:17.627
- I think spending forever
with someone

41:17.660 --> 41:20.963

a really big commitment...

41:20.997 --> 41:23.800

41:35.745 --> 41:36.946
