WEBVTT

00:00.526 --> 00:03.094
You've really done a great job.

00:03.128 --> 00:04.796
I'm just very disappointed.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.097
It's incredibly impressive.

00:06.131 --> 00:07.699
Thank you very much.

00:07.933 --> 00:09.600
(McKenzie)
Previously on <i> Face Off...</i>

00:09.635 --> 00:12.970
Logan's self-applied superhero
slayed the competition.

00:13.005 --> 00:14.205
[applause]

00:14.239 --> 00:16.274
And Team Laura finally lost
another member

00:16.308 --> 00:17.875
when Stephanie was sent home.

00:21.780 --> 00:23.581
Now six artists remain.

00:23.615 --> 00:25.683
And tonight there's
no more playing around

00:25.717 --> 00:27.785
as the competition
gets very real.

00:27.820 --> 00:30.621
Nothing compares
to the imagination

00:30.656 --> 00:31.622
of a child.

00:31.657 --> 00:32.756
(Logan)
This can be very fun,

00:32.791 --> 00:33.858
or it can be a total nightmare.

00:33.892 --> 00:34.992
(Rayce)
It's going awful.

00:35.027 --> 00:36.527
The fur needs to get done here,
man.

00:36.562 --> 00:37.829
Ben bit off more
than he can chew.

00:37.863 --> 00:38.830
(Laura)
You okay?

00:38.864 --> 00:40.865
It's getting worse.
It just sucks.

00:41.967 --> 00:43.501
When Barney has nightmares,

00:43.535 --> 00:45.736
this is what it looks like.

00:45.771 --> 00:48.439
(McKenzie) In the end, only
one will win a VIP trip

00:48.474 --> 00:49.841
from Kryolan Professional
Make-Up

00:49.875 --> 00:52.543
to one of their 85 international
locations,

00:52.578 --> 00:55.513
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

00:55.547 --> 00:57.615
and $100,000.

00:59.284 --> 01:00.985
This is <i> Face Off.</i>

01:38.991 --> 01:41.559
This is a pretty low point
for me in the competition.

01:41.593 --> 01:44.462
I'm away from my family,
and I miss them so much.

01:44.496 --> 01:46.430
It's starting to take a toll.

01:46.465 --> 01:49.200
Being on the bottom
doesn't feel good.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.802
But to win...
because we've made it

01:51.837 --> 01:54.071
to the final six,
which is really awesome.

01:54.106 --> 01:56.807
At this point, half of us will
be competing in the finale.

01:56.842 --> 01:58.476
I just want to make it there
so bad.

01:58.510 --> 01:59.877
Whatever challenge
comes up next,

01:59.912 --> 02:01.579
I want to push myself.

02:01.613 --> 02:04.215
If it's easy,
then it's not worth $100,000.

02:10.722 --> 02:12.089
It's a nice day at the park.

02:12.124 --> 02:13.958
(Emily)
This place is really cool.

02:13.992 --> 02:16.827
(Darla) It's a gorgeous day, and
there's kids running around

02:16.862 --> 02:18.362
and a huge playground,

02:18.397 --> 02:21.132
and we're not really sure
exactly what we're doing here,

02:21.166 --> 02:24.702
but I don't think it's just to
go play on the swing set.

02:24.736 --> 02:27.238
(Emily)
This is cool.

02:27.272 --> 02:30.474
Welcome to Brookside Park
in Pasadena.

02:30.509 --> 02:33.711
Every year, movie studios spend
millions of dollars

02:33.745 --> 02:36.881
on Hollywood's top writers,
producers, and directors

02:36.915 --> 02:39.383
to conjure mind-blowing
action sequences,

02:39.418 --> 02:41.118
spectacular fantasy worlds,

02:41.153 --> 02:42.320
and over-the-top characters

02:42.354 --> 02:44.622
to entertain people
all over the globe.

02:44.656 --> 02:46.691
Now, while these incredible
individuals

02:46.725 --> 02:48.826
are some of
the world's most creative minds,

02:48.860 --> 02:52.997
nothing compares
to the innocent originality

02:53.031 --> 02:56.100
and raw imagination of a child.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.502
- Oh, my God.
- I love it.

02:58.537 --> 03:00.504
Hey, guys.
Come on over.

03:00.539 --> 03:01.939
- Kids.
- Oh, my God.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.175
[laughs]

03:04.209 --> 03:05.176
Oh, man.

03:05.210 --> 03:06.711
(McKenzie)
Come on in here.

03:06.745 --> 03:07.912
There you go.

03:07.946 --> 03:09.213
How are you guys doing?

03:09.248 --> 03:10.381
(all)
Good!

03:10.415 --> 03:11.616
You ready to have some fun
today?

03:11.650 --> 03:13.217
(all)
Yes!

03:13.252 --> 03:15.119
(McKenzie) All right, so
as you may have guessed,

03:15.153 --> 03:17.688
you'll be working
with these amazing kids today.

03:17.723 --> 03:20.358
(Logan) I love kids, but I
have no idea what's coming.

03:20.392 --> 03:24.228
This can be very fun,
or it can be a total nightmare.

03:24.263 --> 03:27.298
(McKenzie) Sometimes, a child's
imagination can be so powerful

03:27.332 --> 03:29.200
that they can see
and hear things

03:29.234 --> 03:30.401
that you and I just can't.

03:30.435 --> 03:32.737
So in this Spotlight Challenge,

03:32.771 --> 03:36.374
you're going to work with one
of these creative visionaries

03:36.408 --> 03:38.376
and bring their imaginary
friends to life

03:38.410 --> 03:40.478
as a whimsical character.

03:40.512 --> 03:41.746
Yes!

03:41.780 --> 03:43.681
(Emily voice over)
I am super excited about this.

03:43.715 --> 03:45.683
Kids... they don't have
boundaries.

03:45.717 --> 03:47.551
This is creativity
at its rawest form.

03:47.586 --> 03:49.220
Oh, my gosh.

03:49.254 --> 03:51.055
Oh, and one more thing.

03:51.089 --> 03:54.158
These guys are gonna be coming
to the reveal stage this week

03:54.192 --> 03:56.961
to see how you've brought
their special friends to life.

03:56.995 --> 03:58.496
So no pressure.

03:58.530 --> 03:59.964
Oh, gosh.

03:59.998 --> 04:01.232
Okay, kids, when I say "Go,"

04:01.266 --> 04:02.933
I want you to run over
and pick a contestant.

04:02.968 --> 04:03.934
You got it?

04:03.969 --> 04:06.437
(all)
Yeah!

04:06.471 --> 04:08.472
(McKenzie)
All right, go get a contestant!

04:08.507 --> 04:09.774
[laughs]

04:09.808 --> 04:10.775
[laughter]

04:10.809 --> 04:11.776
How are you?

04:11.810 --> 04:12.810
What's up?

04:12.844 --> 04:14.078
- Adam.
- Lance.

04:14.112 --> 04:15.479
- Why don't we go over there?
- Okay.

04:15.514 --> 04:17.180
(Ben) Let's go draw something.
You ready?

04:17.214 --> 04:18.182
- Yeah.
- Come on, buddy.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.483
(man)
Holy cow.

04:21.452 --> 04:22.420
We're both gonna draw it.

04:22.454 --> 04:24.055
Oh.

04:24.089 --> 04:26.657
(Logan) Alexandra is an
adorable little blonde girl.

04:26.692 --> 04:28.659
And I'm wanting to do a monster.

04:28.694 --> 04:30.494
So I'm looking at her
with hopeful eyes, like,

04:30.529 --> 04:31.729
"What do you want,
Alexandra?"

04:31.763 --> 04:33.764
My imaginary thing is a mermaid.

04:33.799 --> 04:34.999
(Logan)
A mermaid.

04:35.033 --> 04:37.234
Shit.

04:37.269 --> 04:39.770
Hm.

04:39.805 --> 04:42.006
Of course.
Mermaid.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.808
She has a pink tail.

04:43.842 --> 04:46.377
(Logan) Alexandra's mermaid
has a very pink tail

04:46.411 --> 04:49.013
with scales
that are glowing hearts

04:49.047 --> 04:51.649
and a heart-shaped bracelet.

04:53.452 --> 04:55.519
That's, like, kind of pink.

04:55.554 --> 04:57.355
Or there's a pink here...

04:57.389 --> 04:59.223
I've never had the color pink
in my airbrush,

04:59.257 --> 05:01.192
but when a little girl
asks you to do a mermaid,

05:01.226 --> 05:03.094
you do a mermaid.

05:03.128 --> 05:05.429
(Alexandra) Oh, I know another
thing we can do to her...

05:05.464 --> 05:06.831
her pet dolphin.

05:06.865 --> 05:08.833
(Logan) Do you know how many
days I have to do this?

05:08.867 --> 05:10.868
- Nevermind.
- No pet dolphins.

05:10.902 --> 05:12.203
Crazy.

05:13.839 --> 05:16.040
- Its name's Lulu.
- Lulu?

05:16.074 --> 05:17.174
I love that name.

05:17.209 --> 05:20.745
It can be a bunny,
and it's super cute.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.114
(Emily)
Maya is adorable.

05:23.148 --> 05:24.982
I love everything about Maya.

05:25.016 --> 05:26.717
She's my best friend.

05:26.752 --> 05:29.754
(Emily) My concept for
Maya's imaginary friend Lulu

05:29.788 --> 05:34.024
is a stuffed animal
that helps inspire creativity.

05:34.059 --> 05:35.426
I can't wait to start on this.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.927
It's gonna be so much fun.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.462
You're awesome, Maya.

05:38.497 --> 05:40.030
Thanks.
You are too.

05:40.065 --> 05:41.132
Thanks.

05:44.503 --> 05:45.936
All right,
so he's got horns, right?

05:45.971 --> 05:48.572
(Lance) Yeah, he's kind of
like a giant alligator.

05:48.607 --> 05:50.107
And he just has two legs,

05:50.142 --> 05:51.976
and he breathes out fire,

05:52.010 --> 05:53.878
and he has lasers
all over his eyes.

05:53.912 --> 05:55.880
Also, it has wings,

05:55.914 --> 05:57.314
like a dragon wings.

05:57.349 --> 05:59.750
Lance has a long list
of everything he wants

05:59.785 --> 06:00.751
in a monster,

06:00.786 --> 06:02.620
but I know
I can't make everything.

06:02.654 --> 06:06.323
And the monster's name is Laser

06:06.358 --> 06:07.324
or Godzilla.

06:07.359 --> 06:08.526
Or Godzilla.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.195
Okay, so what if we spell it
like "La-zor."

06:11.229 --> 06:12.630
Great.

06:12.664 --> 06:16.967
I envision Lazor as
a creature responsible

06:17.002 --> 06:18.102
for missing toys.

06:18.136 --> 06:19.170
So for this character,

06:19.204 --> 06:21.672
I'm going to fabricate
a lower jaw

06:21.706 --> 06:23.374
coming from the model's chest

06:23.408 --> 06:26.510
and then do a whole upper jaw
and a head.

06:26.545 --> 06:28.979
This isn't
a heavy makeup character.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.515
And it's gonna involve
a lot of suit fabrication,

06:31.550 --> 06:33.584
so I'm worried about,
it may put me on the bottom.

06:33.618 --> 06:35.453
You gonna be a designer
when you grow up?

06:35.487 --> 06:37.788
I was more thinking of a model.

06:37.823 --> 06:39.190
Oh, well, that's always...

06:39.224 --> 06:40.191
A muscleman model.

06:40.225 --> 06:41.525
That's cool.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.161
(Jordyn) So her head's,
like, a big real diamond.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.396
(Darla)
Okay.

06:45.430 --> 06:48.098
Because her skin,
it looks like sparkles.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.633
And she lives underground.

06:49.668 --> 06:51.168
Okay.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.803
(Jordyn) She has a purse that
she always takes with her.

06:52.838 --> 06:54.872
- Her shoes are like high heels.
- Mm-hmm.

06:54.906 --> 06:58.776
Jordyn tells me a lot
of information very quickly,

06:58.810 --> 07:01.612
so I just started writing a list
as fast as I can.

07:01.646 --> 07:03.113
Now, you said
she has a diamond head.

07:03.148 --> 07:04.748
Yeah.

07:04.783 --> 07:07.251
(Darla) Jordyn's imaginary
friend has curly hair,

07:07.285 --> 07:08.385
black buttons for eyes,

07:08.420 --> 07:09.920
wears a sparkly pink dress,

07:09.955 --> 07:12.456
but the thing that's making me
the most nervous right now

07:12.491 --> 07:14.692
is this sparkly blue
diamond face.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.126
[moans]

07:16.161 --> 07:18.829
Diamonds are translucent,

07:18.864 --> 07:20.764
and you can't make
a person see-through.

07:20.799 --> 07:21.765
[laughs]

07:21.800 --> 07:22.833
It looks like a diamond.

07:22.868 --> 07:24.101
(Darla)
Nice and sparkly too.

07:24.135 --> 07:25.903
Perfect.

07:25.937 --> 07:28.539
(Blayne) Ben, you have
to make it like me.

07:28.573 --> 07:31.442
Look at mine.
See how mine are shaped?

07:31.476 --> 07:34.178
Blayne has the biggest
imagination ever

07:34.212 --> 07:36.714
and wants everything
on this creature.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.516
How many heads does he have?

07:38.550 --> 07:40.050
- Three.
- Three heads?

07:40.085 --> 07:41.285
- Yep.
- Big heads?

07:41.319 --> 07:42.820
(Blayne)
The size of your head.

07:42.854 --> 07:44.522
Oh, and one has horns.

07:44.556 --> 07:47.591
He wants three heads,
wings on the head.

07:47.626 --> 07:48.859
One of them has horns,

07:48.894 --> 07:50.594
and the other one has one eye.

07:50.629 --> 07:52.162
He wants it to have a tail,

07:52.197 --> 07:53.597
no legs,

07:53.632 --> 07:55.599
and walks around on its arms.

07:55.634 --> 07:56.901
I have to kind of remind him

07:56.935 --> 07:58.602
that I got to put a person
inside this thing.

07:58.637 --> 07:59.803
It has to fly!

07:59.838 --> 08:01.038
Fly?

08:01.072 --> 08:02.606
We have to see him walk out
on the stage.

08:02.641 --> 08:03.607
Nope.

08:03.642 --> 08:04.942
This is a tall order,

08:04.976 --> 08:06.777
and I'm not sure
how I'm gonna get away with it.

08:07.812 --> 08:09.380
I'm not done.

08:13.251 --> 08:15.352
Andrew is a wild kid.

08:15.387 --> 08:18.556
He's doing backflips, and
I can't even keep up with him.

08:18.590 --> 08:21.258
He's like a B-boy,
but he's half zombie.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.060
The rest of the face is, like,
all ripped up.

08:23.094 --> 08:24.528
(Julian)
Okay. Awesome.

08:24.563 --> 08:25.896
I like where this is going.

08:25.931 --> 08:26.964
What's B-boy?

08:26.998 --> 08:28.632
It's like a type of dancing,
but...

08:28.667 --> 08:29.633
Like break dancing?

08:29.668 --> 08:30.701
Yeah, break dancing,

08:30.735 --> 08:32.035
but they call it B-boying.

08:32.070 --> 08:33.070
Okay.

08:33.104 --> 08:35.072
Andrew's imaginary friend
B-boy Z

08:35.106 --> 08:36.907
is half-zombie, half-human.

08:36.942 --> 08:40.376
He wants him to be bloody,
with his heart exposed,

08:40.412 --> 08:41.946
and have a mohawk.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.780
I really dig
his imaginary friend.

08:43.815 --> 08:44.782
That's my style.

08:44.816 --> 08:45.783
(Darla)
Cool.

08:45.817 --> 08:46.784
We done?

08:46.818 --> 08:48.886
I think we're good.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.187
(girl)
Bye!

08:50.221 --> 08:51.889
(Emily)
That was so much fun.

08:58.797 --> 09:00.898
I love the energy from the park,

09:00.932 --> 09:03.767
and ready to get into the lab
and try new things.

09:03.802 --> 09:05.336
(Emily)
Can't wait to grab another wig.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.171
I'm sure they're
gonna love that.

09:07.205 --> 09:08.906
From what the judges
have said in the past,

09:08.940 --> 09:10.374
I need to start
breaking up my makeups

09:10.408 --> 09:12.042
so they don't look the same.

09:12.077 --> 09:13.444
So I'm gonna use a wig.

09:13.478 --> 09:14.912
I just have to get more subtle.

09:14.946 --> 09:16.180
This is the one.

09:16.214 --> 09:19.283
And I come up with the idea
to flock my rabbit.

09:19.317 --> 09:21.285
This is all flocking?
Yes.

09:21.319 --> 09:24.355
Flocking is basically
tiny bits of fabric.

09:24.389 --> 09:26.357
I want to give it on my pieces

09:26.391 --> 09:28.192
so when you touch it,
it's velvet.

09:28.226 --> 09:30.494
But before I start
sculpting anything,

09:30.528 --> 09:33.130
I want to test out my idea.

09:33.164 --> 09:36.433
So I grab just a random
foam latex prosthetic,

09:36.468 --> 09:37.835
and I paint it with Pros-Aide,

09:37.869 --> 09:40.404
I cover it with the flocking,
and then brush it away.

09:40.438 --> 09:42.239
And it has that velvet texture.

09:47.445 --> 09:48.412
Hey, what's up?

09:48.446 --> 09:49.413
Good afternoon, guys.

09:49.447 --> 09:50.481
(Laura)
Hey.

09:50.515 --> 09:51.882
(Rayce)
Hey, it's getting quiet in here.

09:51.916 --> 09:52.883
What kid did you get?

09:52.917 --> 09:54.618
I got this kid named Andrew.

09:54.653 --> 09:56.053
He wants B-boy Z.

09:56.087 --> 09:57.721
It stands for
B-boy Zombie.

09:57.756 --> 10:00.124
But he wanted,
like,<i> Walking Dead</i> zombie.

10:00.158 --> 10:02.226
I'm all for it, but...

10:02.260 --> 10:03.560
Um...

10:03.595 --> 10:05.529
I'm instantly worried.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.298
Uh, let's see here.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.167
The heartbeat is exposed
and bleeding?

10:10.201 --> 10:11.402
That's what he was saying.

10:11.436 --> 10:13.237
(Laura)
I love gory characters too,

10:13.271 --> 10:17.541
but the challenge is to make
a kid-friendly character.

10:17.575 --> 10:22.046
And if Julian comes out
with a realistic zombie,

10:22.080 --> 10:24.982
he's guaranteed to go home.

10:29.554 --> 10:30.988
I think this kid just wanted,

10:31.022 --> 10:32.523
like, a break dancing zombie.

10:32.557 --> 10:35.125
It's the first day of
the imaginary friend challenge,

10:35.160 --> 10:37.895
and Laura is concerned
about my design.

10:37.929 --> 10:40.097
It's your responsibility
as a designer

10:40.131 --> 10:43.567
to take that concept
and expand on it.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.402
(Julian)
It's coming across too gruesome.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.937
This is pretty daunting.

10:46.971 --> 10:49.606
I'm not used to doing
whimsical at all.

10:49.641 --> 10:52.943
There was a challenge
just like this in Season 3

10:52.977 --> 10:55.112
where we had kids come in.

10:55.146 --> 10:56.880
And these kids
had so many ideas.

10:56.915 --> 11:01.318
In Season 3, Rod ended up doing
exactly what the child wanted,

11:01.352 --> 11:02.920
and he got kicked off for it.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.055
And I don't want to see
the same thing happen to Julian.

11:05.089 --> 11:06.924
We got to bring it
into a concept

11:06.958 --> 11:08.826
that's fun to look at.

11:08.860 --> 11:10.661
We decide to make some changes.

11:10.695 --> 11:12.863
Instead of just
a plain hair mohawk,

11:12.897 --> 11:15.065
we decide to go
with a bone mohawk.

11:15.099 --> 11:17.367
Instead of splitting the zombie
straight down the middle,

11:17.402 --> 11:19.069
make it asymmetrical.

11:19.103 --> 11:20.938
But I'm a little worried
that this is straying

11:20.972 --> 11:23.774
a little too far away
from what Andrew wants,

11:23.808 --> 11:26.043
and I don't want
to disappoint him.

11:26.077 --> 11:27.711
All right, let's do this.

11:27.745 --> 11:29.479
Yeah, just go for it.

11:33.751 --> 11:35.085
- How you doing, man?
- Good.

11:35.119 --> 11:36.954
(Anthony)
So he's got three heads, huh?

11:36.988 --> 11:38.455
And he can move his heads
up and...

11:38.489 --> 11:40.224
He can go like this
with his heads.

11:40.258 --> 11:41.992
(Anthony) Ben is the
last person on my team,

11:42.026 --> 11:43.694
and I can see Ben in the finale.

11:43.728 --> 11:46.597
He's one of the best sculptors
in this competition.

11:46.631 --> 11:48.498
So you have to sculpt
three different faces.

11:48.533 --> 11:51.602
There's gonna be two heads
that are actually on the arms.

11:51.636 --> 11:55.272
Then there's gonna be a big head
that sits over the model's head.

11:55.306 --> 11:58.976
And since Blayne wants
this character to have no legs,

11:59.010 --> 12:01.178
I'm gonna have my model
on his knees.

12:01.212 --> 12:02.546
Do you think
you can pull it off?

12:02.580 --> 12:03.680
Yeah.

12:03.715 --> 12:05.282
I am worried about Ben
on this challenge,

12:05.316 --> 12:06.383
going this big.

12:06.417 --> 12:09.119
I think this is
crazy enough to work.

12:09.153 --> 12:11.388
This is a huge undertaking.

12:11.422 --> 12:12.623
I get it.

12:12.657 --> 12:14.958
I know everything
that I'm risking here.

12:14.993 --> 12:16.526
(Adam)
Rather than sculpting the head,

12:16.561 --> 12:18.562
I decided
to fabricate the chest,

12:18.596 --> 12:20.163
because the shape of the chest

12:20.198 --> 12:22.566
is gonna dictate
the shape of the head.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.401
So I decide to leave
all the sculpting

12:24.435 --> 12:25.669
and molding for day two.

12:27.171 --> 12:28.805
So I start working on the body.

12:28.840 --> 12:31.541
I create a simple chest harness.

12:31.576 --> 12:33.844
From there, I grab foam padding,

12:33.878 --> 12:36.513
and I start gluing
and pinching it

12:36.547 --> 12:41.151
to actually build up the overall
silhouette of the character.

12:41.185 --> 12:44.488
Once that's done,
I coat the foam in latex

12:44.522 --> 12:47.991
so I can start adding paper
towels and more latex over it

12:48.026 --> 12:50.761
and make all the pinch points
look like muscles under skin.

12:50.795 --> 12:52.930
That's his lower jaw.

12:52.964 --> 12:56.033
Yeah, the whole head
is gonna be a mouth.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.601
Hi, everybody.

12:57.635 --> 12:58.602
(both)
Hey!

12:58.636 --> 12:59.603
Hello.

12:59.637 --> 13:00.938
Alexandra named it Bella.

13:00.972 --> 13:02.606
It's a mermaid.

13:02.640 --> 13:05.475
She wants coral reef
embedded in her skin,

13:05.510 --> 13:07.444
which is difficult
to make beautiful.

13:07.478 --> 13:09.112
This is coral,
what you're doing here?

13:09.147 --> 13:10.247
Correct, yes.

13:10.281 --> 13:11.915
I'm thinking of whether
you actually need

13:11.950 --> 13:13.283
this right here in the center.

13:13.318 --> 13:14.518
It's really not attractive.

13:14.552 --> 13:16.286
(Logan) Mr. Westmore
is absolutely right.

13:16.321 --> 13:17.754
My model has a very pretty face,

13:17.789 --> 13:21.291
and to sculpt something over it
is really just unnecessary.

13:21.326 --> 13:22.693
Oh, Blayne even
did you a sketch.

13:22.727 --> 13:24.461
You don't even have
to worry about anything.

13:24.495 --> 13:25.929
That's right.

13:25.964 --> 13:27.631
(Michael) Now, how are you
going to paint your eyes?

13:27.665 --> 13:28.732
(Ben)
I'll paint the detail over,

13:28.766 --> 13:30.300
and then put a shine to it.

13:30.335 --> 13:31.735
If you have a black iris,

13:31.769 --> 13:33.270
put a dot of highlight into it,

13:33.304 --> 13:36.373
because I know judges
haven't really liked it.

13:36.407 --> 13:37.841
So spend time

13:37.875 --> 13:40.444
and really concentrate
on your eyeballs.

13:40.478 --> 13:41.812
What did Andrew come up with?

13:41.846 --> 13:45.048
He wanted
a zombie break-dancer.

13:45.083 --> 13:47.250
He's a big fan of the scary,

13:47.285 --> 13:48.719
but I'm also trying
to translate it

13:48.753 --> 13:50.854
into more whimsical look.

13:50.888 --> 13:52.189
The only way you're gonna get

13:52.223 --> 13:53.557
any whimsical in here at all

13:53.591 --> 13:56.026
is to really give
yourself a good smile...

13:56.060 --> 13:57.027
Smile, mm-hmm.

13:57.061 --> 13:58.028
On your lower piece.

13:58.062 --> 13:59.062
I mean, if it's too...

13:59.097 --> 14:00.664
The higher up
and the straighter it gets,

14:00.698 --> 14:02.833
it's gonna be come more horror

14:02.867 --> 14:04.835
than it is whimsical or fantasy.

14:04.869 --> 14:07.871
- This was her drawing.
- Oh, my gosh.

14:07.905 --> 14:10.507
The character
has buttons for eyes.

14:10.541 --> 14:12.342
And Laura had a great idea

14:12.377 --> 14:14.011
of using glasses,

14:14.045 --> 14:16.413
and then fabricating buttons.

14:16.447 --> 14:18.315
Could be the rims
with the handle.

14:18.349 --> 14:19.916
Oh, that would be cute.

14:19.951 --> 14:21.251
That could be too, yeah.

14:21.285 --> 14:23.920
Button eyes tend to be
a little creepy-looking,

14:23.955 --> 14:25.589
but Jordyn was pretty specific.

14:25.623 --> 14:28.759
And so I don't want
to scrap it completely.

14:28.793 --> 14:30.494
To make this nice and whimsical,

14:30.528 --> 14:31.661
those buttons need to be big.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.363
Definitely.

14:33.398 --> 14:35.298
(Michael) But that's a good
idea on a stick like that.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.333
Yeah.

14:36.367 --> 14:37.667
- Bye, everyone.
- Bye!

14:46.711 --> 14:48.078
That's time, everyone.

14:57.955 --> 15:00.257
(Ben) So it's day two of our
imaginary friend challenge,

15:00.291 --> 15:02.025
Got 9 1/2 hours
in the lab today,

15:02.060 --> 15:03.927
and I've got a whole bunch
of stuff

15:03.961 --> 15:04.928
that I got to get finished.

15:04.962 --> 15:06.630
Ready to release your
inner child today?

15:06.664 --> 15:08.198
I start working
on the main head.

15:08.232 --> 15:09.433
I need to mold these bastards

15:09.467 --> 15:11.802
within, like,
the first hour and a half.

15:11.836 --> 15:13.170
I need to get
this thing finished

15:13.204 --> 15:14.771
so that I can mold
all three of these

15:14.806 --> 15:16.206
at the same time.

15:21.512 --> 15:23.513
Her legs will be inside.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.182
(Rayce)
I see Logan's mermaid tail,

15:25.216 --> 15:27.317
and it's really ugly.

15:27.351 --> 15:29.319
Did you have to make it
really bulky right here

15:29.353 --> 15:30.587
to make it work?

15:30.621 --> 15:32.556
It's just this really weird,
blocky form

15:32.590 --> 15:33.857
with duct tape around it.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.692
It can't be that;
Like, it just can't.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.327
It's gonna look awful.

15:37.361 --> 15:39.529
Rayce points out
that it's bulky,

15:39.564 --> 15:41.198
which I completely agree with.

15:41.232 --> 15:43.667
So I have to start over.

15:43.701 --> 15:45.402
You can take that
and kind of twist it.

15:45.436 --> 15:46.803
(Logan)
The new design for the tail

15:46.838 --> 15:48.872
is a little bit more shapely
than the one I had before.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.174
It's a combination
of cutting out foam,

15:51.209 --> 15:53.810
cutting out strips
of armature wire

15:53.845 --> 15:56.179
to create some structure
and some strength.

15:56.214 --> 15:58.081
And it's starting
to come together.

15:58.116 --> 15:59.950
(Laura)
Oh, they're hearts.

15:59.984 --> 16:01.351
So cute.

16:07.191 --> 16:08.592
(Emily)
I'm going to sculpt the cowl

16:08.626 --> 16:12.295
and leave the big rabbit ears
tied back into the hair

16:12.330 --> 16:14.731
so I can give down a wig.

16:17.502 --> 16:19.402
Sculpting is just repetitive,

16:19.437 --> 16:22.072
and it's... now I'm stuck
in my own thoughts.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.907
And I just start thinking
about my family.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.776
These challenges are
getting really difficult.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.078
Mm-hmm.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.247
I really miss my family.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.715
Mm.

16:31.749 --> 16:34.451
I don't know; It just sucks.

16:34.485 --> 16:36.853
I'm just...
I'm crying sculpting.

16:36.888 --> 16:38.855
And it's getting worse.

16:43.194 --> 16:44.327
(Laura)
You okay?

16:45.863 --> 16:46.897
You need to take a minute?

16:49.333 --> 16:51.034
It is really, really difficult.

16:54.138 --> 16:57.440
I walk outside, and I don't
want to walk back in.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.031
(Laura)
It's day two in the lab,

17:12.066 --> 17:15.068
and Emily is very much
missing her family,

17:15.102 --> 17:17.503
so I'm worried for her.

17:29.183 --> 17:31.050
This competition
is so important to me,

17:31.085 --> 17:33.353
and I've worked so hard
to be here.

17:33.387 --> 17:35.722
So I come back in, and I'm ready

17:35.756 --> 17:38.458
to put my full effort
into everything

17:38.492 --> 17:40.527
and get out of this funk.

17:40.561 --> 17:42.929
I cried it out.

17:42.963 --> 17:44.697
I'm not gonna give up.

17:50.971 --> 17:52.238
(Ben)
I finish the faces.

17:52.273 --> 17:54.174
Gonna run them into the molder
as fast as possible

17:54.208 --> 17:56.276
so I can start molding them
in Hydrocal.

17:56.310 --> 17:59.279
Hydrocal sets up faster,
and the heads are huge,

17:59.313 --> 18:01.648
so I'm gonna do them
at the same time.

18:01.682 --> 18:03.082
And I've got three of them,

18:03.117 --> 18:05.752
so this is quite a task
in and of itself.

18:05.786 --> 18:06.753
What's up?

18:06.787 --> 18:07.754
Just setting up.

18:07.788 --> 18:09.255
Yeah, you're good, though.

18:09.290 --> 18:11.524
(Ben) Having Anthony's full
attention is really great.

18:11.559 --> 18:12.859
We're gonna work
as hard as we can

18:12.893 --> 18:15.462
to make sure that we both stay
here for as long as possible.

18:15.496 --> 18:17.530
(Anthony) Get underneath
that chin a little bit.

18:17.565 --> 18:18.998
Smooth that down a little bit.

18:24.538 --> 18:25.672
Adios, guys.

18:25.706 --> 18:26.739
Good luck.

18:30.077 --> 18:31.377
(Darla)
After I get the mold done,

18:31.412 --> 18:32.912
the rest of the day will be
figuring out

18:32.947 --> 18:35.515
how to fabricate
this crystal collar piece.

18:36.817 --> 18:39.586
I've never really done
fabrication before,

18:39.620 --> 18:43.523
so I'm not really sure
exactly what I'm doing.

18:43.557 --> 18:46.025
I start hot-gluing
the crystals,

18:46.060 --> 18:48.328
and then I place cotton
and latex

18:48.362 --> 18:50.597
so that it looks as though
the crystals

18:50.631 --> 18:52.632
are coming out of her skin.

18:52.666 --> 18:54.901
I'm just using all the advice
that Laura gave me,

18:54.935 --> 18:56.669
and I'm figuring it out as I go.

18:56.704 --> 18:57.670
Looks good, Darla.

18:57.705 --> 18:59.906
Thanks.

18:59.940 --> 19:02.609
I love the teeth, love them.

19:02.643 --> 19:04.110
I'm a little worried,

19:04.144 --> 19:06.746
because there's still a lot
I have to fabricate and paint.

19:06.780 --> 19:10.216
And I'm not going to get my head
until application day,

19:10.251 --> 19:13.620
so I won't know if it really
fits until the last minute.

19:16.857 --> 19:18.324
How many minutes does it say?

19:18.359 --> 19:19.626
(Darla)
I think we're under ten,

19:19.660 --> 19:20.693
but I can't read it.

19:20.728 --> 19:21.895
(Emily)
Seven, it's at seven.

19:21.929 --> 19:23.496
(Darla)
Sure, that sounds about right.

19:28.903 --> 19:30.403
All right, everybody,
that's time.

19:32.206 --> 19:33.673
Now that I'm so close
to top five,

19:33.707 --> 19:36.075
like, now I got
to really go for it,

19:36.110 --> 19:38.378
and I'm trying to do that
on this challenge.

19:45.219 --> 19:47.453
Oh, gosh, here we go.

19:47.488 --> 19:49.889
It's application day,
and we have four hours to apply

19:49.924 --> 19:51.658
and one hour Last Looks.

19:51.692 --> 19:53.726
Ah, fuck.

19:53.761 --> 19:55.461
(Emily voice over)
And the first thing I see

19:55.496 --> 19:57.897
is a big chunk of my ear
just taken out.

19:57.932 --> 20:00.300
Oh, no, my foam.

20:00.334 --> 20:01.568
You can fix this.

20:01.602 --> 20:02.669
Yeah.

20:02.703 --> 20:04.137
You just have
to give it together,

20:04.171 --> 20:05.738
and then you can
cotton in latex,

20:05.773 --> 20:07.407
and then cavo.

20:07.441 --> 20:08.575
I just have so much to do,

20:08.609 --> 20:12.211
and this is just
taking time out to fix this.

20:12.246 --> 20:14.747
It'll take maybe half and hour
more of your time.

20:14.782 --> 20:15.748
Yeah.

20:15.783 --> 20:17.750
But it's worth it.

20:21.822 --> 20:23.289
- Hello, hello.
- Hi.

20:25.859 --> 20:27.126
You're a big-ass monster.

20:27.161 --> 20:28.161
That's for sure.

20:31.799 --> 20:34.000
Fuck.

20:34.034 --> 20:35.101
Awesome.

20:35.135 --> 20:36.703
- All right, ready for these?
- Yeah.

20:36.737 --> 20:40.239
(Ben voice over) Today I have
to run the polyfoam heads,

20:40.274 --> 20:43.076
and then I got to create
an entire foam suit,

20:43.110 --> 20:44.510
and then cover it in fur.

20:44.545 --> 20:48.047
There's just so much to do
that it's just mind-blowing.

20:48.082 --> 20:49.849
What are you gonna do
about the wings?

20:52.856 --> 20:53.953
If you want, lay them out

20:53.988 --> 20:56.022
and tell your model
to give them for you.

20:56.056 --> 20:58.825
Ben's running around
multitasking like a madman.

20:58.859 --> 21:00.627
The furnies get done
here, man, seriously.

21:00.661 --> 21:02.128
Why... You gonna sit in it?

21:02.162 --> 21:03.363
What?

21:03.397 --> 21:05.598
- I need somebody in it.
- I'll sit in it.

21:05.633 --> 21:07.467
As a coach, I can't
do the work for him.

21:07.501 --> 21:10.536
So his model helps him
fabricate things,

21:10.571 --> 21:13.606
and I'll just be
in the suit all day.

21:13.641 --> 21:15.675
You look good in this.

21:15.709 --> 21:16.709
[laughter]

21:16.744 --> 21:18.511
Why do I feel like a king?

21:21.148 --> 21:23.549
As it sits right now,
it's very much

21:23.584 --> 21:25.418
like this is a chest plate

21:25.452 --> 21:27.854
that just happens to look
like a bottom jaw.

21:27.888 --> 21:29.489
The only unique thing
about my design

21:29.523 --> 21:32.291
is this giant mouth
opening and closing.

21:32.326 --> 21:33.926
The closer you bring
this to his head,

21:33.961 --> 21:35.695
maybe there's, like,
a little bit of batting

21:35.729 --> 21:37.363
to kind of pull this up
on the back.

21:37.398 --> 21:40.199
If that doesn't work,
my concept is shit.

21:44.505 --> 21:46.839
(Darla) This is gonna be
a weird piece to apply.

21:46.874 --> 21:48.708
The appliance
covers her entire face,

21:48.742 --> 21:50.443
but then there's a big hole
in the center,

21:50.477 --> 21:52.445
so there's definitely some edges
around the mouth

21:52.479 --> 21:54.213
that I'm gonna have
to worry about.

21:54.248 --> 21:57.517
There's only six of us left,
so one little mistake

21:57.551 --> 21:59.485
could end up putting you
on the bottom.

22:01.388 --> 22:02.388
Awesome.

22:02.389 --> 22:04.724
(Julian) I'm amazed at how
well this lined up right here.

22:04.758 --> 22:07.193
(Laura)
Yeah, that's great.

22:07.227 --> 22:10.763
I'm a little torn about which
way to go with the paint job,

22:10.798 --> 22:13.032
but I decide to go
more realistic,

22:13.067 --> 22:16.936
just because the sculpt
is already so cartoony.

22:16.970 --> 22:19.839
If I go with more of
the bright purples and reds

22:19.873 --> 22:22.041
that Andrew was asking for,

22:22.076 --> 22:25.078
it may not read as a zombie.

22:25.112 --> 22:26.245
(man)
30 minutes, guys.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.048
30 minutes, Ben.

22:35.656 --> 22:39.258
(Ben) This is the biggest
thing that I've ever created,

22:39.293 --> 22:41.594
and I'm not even sure
how this thing's gonna turn out.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.096
Do you want one of these wigs?

22:43.130 --> 22:44.664
Yeah, just throw
them both in there.

22:44.698 --> 22:46.666
(Anthony)
Ben is going into Last Looks

22:46.700 --> 22:48.468
with a week's worth of work

22:48.502 --> 22:50.002
that he has to complete
in an hour.

22:50.037 --> 22:51.504
That's time, everybody!

22:51.538 --> 22:53.940
He definitely bit off more than
he can chew on this challenge.

22:53.974 --> 22:56.976
And I didn't quite see a way
to rein it back in.

22:57.978 --> 22:59.278
Is that sweat?

22:59.313 --> 23:00.580
Yeah.

23:00.614 --> 23:02.281
I don't think I've ever been
this terrified

23:02.316 --> 23:03.382
in this competition.

23:10.170 --> 23:12.138
This is weird.
Never been on this side.

23:12.172 --> 23:13.940
Trying to get you situated.

23:13.974 --> 23:15.975
My model has absolutely
nothing on him,

23:16.009 --> 23:18.010
so I need to start
buttoning everything up.

23:18.045 --> 23:20.846
I'm using hot give guns,
safety pins,

23:20.881 --> 23:23.115
everything I can to start
gluing this fun fur down.

23:26.019 --> 23:28.087
I grab some Kryolan
colored hair spray

23:28.121 --> 23:31.357
and start blending the colors
and painting some polka dots.

23:31.391 --> 23:34.961
It makes the fun fur
look appropriate, not so solid.

23:38.365 --> 23:39.699
Makeup, makeup.

23:39.733 --> 23:41.934
I am not terribly experienced
with beauty makeup.

23:41.969 --> 23:44.103
(woman) Like, if you put
something, like, right here,

23:44.137 --> 23:46.205
it gives it, like,
a different effect.

23:46.239 --> 23:47.540
I'm getting advice
from my model,

23:47.574 --> 23:49.675
and it seems to be working.

23:49.710 --> 23:52.511
I still have to zombify
B-boy Z's hands.

23:52.546 --> 23:56.482
So I rush to get everything
glued down and painted

23:56.516 --> 23:57.683
as fast as I can.

23:57.718 --> 23:59.218
Ten minutes, everybody.

24:08.128 --> 24:09.462
It's time!

24:12.933 --> 24:15.067
(Ben)
This thing is not finished,

24:15.102 --> 24:17.303
and I'm afraid
this could end badly

24:17.337 --> 24:19.205
for both me and Anthony.

24:28.715 --> 24:30.182
Oh, my gosh.
They're so cute.

24:30.217 --> 24:32.551
Welcome back
to the reveal stage.

24:32.586 --> 24:33.652
You remember these guys.

24:33.687 --> 24:34.987
Oh, yeah.

24:35.022 --> 24:37.023
Are you guys excited
to see your imaginary friends?

24:37.057 --> 24:38.357
(all)
Yeah!

24:38.392 --> 24:39.658
(McKenzie)
Me too!

24:39.693 --> 24:42.094
But before we see them,
I want you guys

24:42.129 --> 24:44.397
to all go stand with the artist
that you worked with.

24:44.431 --> 24:46.799
Come on, Maya.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.567
How are you doing?

24:48.602 --> 24:49.568
Hi!

24:49.603 --> 24:51.404
- How are you?
- Good.

24:53.507 --> 24:55.541
All right, guys,
before we see your creations,

24:55.575 --> 24:57.510
let's say hello to our judges.

24:57.544 --> 24:59.879
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

24:59.913 --> 25:00.880
Glenn Hetrick.

25:00.914 --> 25:01.881
Good evening, guys.

25:01.915 --> 25:03.015
- Good evening.
- Hello.

25:03.050 --> 25:05.284
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

25:05.318 --> 25:06.719
Hi, everybody.

25:06.753 --> 25:08.187
Hello.

25:08.221 --> 25:10.890
And creature and concept
designer Neville Page.

25:10.924 --> 25:11.891
Hi, kids.

25:11.925 --> 25:13.325
(all)
Hi!

25:13.360 --> 25:15.494
Okay, this week
your Spotlight Challenge

25:15.529 --> 25:17.430
was to work with these
adorable kids

25:17.464 --> 25:19.865
and help bring their
imaginary friends to life,

25:19.900 --> 25:21.834
so let's take a look
at your creations.

25:21.868 --> 25:23.069
You ready?

25:23.103 --> 25:24.336
Ready.

25:44.958 --> 25:46.926
(Julian) It's not the
cleanest makeup I've done,

25:46.960 --> 25:48.594
so I don't think I'm on top,

25:48.628 --> 25:50.396
but I'm thinking
I'm in a good place

25:50.430 --> 25:52.064
for the sheer fact that the kids

25:52.099 --> 25:53.766
are enjoying the character
so much.

25:53.800 --> 25:56.168
[laughter]

26:12.786 --> 26:14.920
(Darla)
Jordyn's eyes just light up,

26:14.955 --> 26:16.622
and I'm really happy
with the character.

26:16.656 --> 26:19.325
I think she looks beautiful,
and she does sparkle.

26:19.359 --> 26:21.026
It's amazing.

26:40.313 --> 26:42.114
(Emily) I wish I had more
time for this makeup,

26:42.149 --> 26:44.183
'cause I know I could have
done a lot more with it,

26:44.217 --> 26:45.718
but I am happy with it.

26:45.752 --> 26:48.921
And I really, really,
really hope Maya likes it.

26:57.464 --> 26:58.931
- Looks good.
- Yeah?

27:08.508 --> 27:10.209
He's like a monster.

27:10.243 --> 27:11.744
It's funny, right?

27:11.778 --> 27:15.114
[laughter]

27:15.148 --> 27:16.448
(Ben)
I'm not happy with it,

27:16.483 --> 27:19.218
but Blayne's really excited
to have the three heads.

27:19.252 --> 27:21.854
I did a lot of work
within these last two days.

27:21.888 --> 27:23.722
Hopefully that'll be
the thing that saves me.

27:40.774 --> 27:42.641
(Logan) I think Alexandra's
really liking it,

27:42.676 --> 27:46.312
but for me,
this could either be a winner

27:46.346 --> 27:48.414
or an absolute disaster.

27:52.052 --> 27:54.687
[roaring]

27:54.721 --> 27:56.956
[laughter]

28:04.898 --> 28:07.233
(Adam) I know the judges
aren't always fans of fun fur,

28:07.267 --> 28:09.501
but that's the foundation
of my character.

28:09.536 --> 28:12.438
And I'm just praying
that he doesn't faint on stage

28:12.472 --> 28:14.540
and horrify a bunch of kids.

28:14.574 --> 28:15.674
[roaring]

28:15.709 --> 28:18.477
[laughter]

28:22.282 --> 28:23.249
So what do you guys think?

28:23.283 --> 28:24.250
Did they do a good job?

28:24.284 --> 28:25.618
(all)
Yeah!

28:25.652 --> 28:27.453
(McKenzie) All right,
well, thank you, kids,

28:27.487 --> 28:28.654
for coming to see us tonight.

28:28.688 --> 28:30.689
Go ahead and say good-bye
to your artists.

28:30.724 --> 28:31.991
Give me a hug.

28:33.426 --> 28:34.893
(McKenzie)
Bye, guys.

28:39.065 --> 28:40.733
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look

28:40.767 --> 28:42.434
at the imaginary friends?

28:49.676 --> 28:51.944
I'm confused.

28:51.978 --> 28:53.579
Can you turn that way for me?

28:53.613 --> 28:55.914
I'd just like to see this side.

28:55.949 --> 28:57.983
He's got a great profile.

28:58.018 --> 29:02.388
It seems really... pointless,
for lack of a better word.

29:02.422 --> 29:03.989
[laughs]

29:04.024 --> 29:05.524
Nice bling.

29:05.558 --> 29:07.559
You can tell
that this is Darla's work,

29:07.594 --> 29:10.529
because she does this thing
with these bone lines.

29:10.563 --> 29:12.931
I think this is cool,
the way she did that treatment

29:12.966 --> 29:15.134
where she had all the crystals
coming out of her.

29:15.168 --> 29:16.302
This is a tough challenge.

29:16.336 --> 29:17.603
It is.

29:19.539 --> 29:21.440
If you imagine this
on a Saturday morning

29:21.474 --> 29:22.741
sort of variety show,

29:22.776 --> 29:24.076
I think it works really well.

29:24.110 --> 29:25.344
This would have been a good week

29:25.378 --> 29:27.613
for her to do one of her
really fabulous big hairdos

29:27.647 --> 29:28.947
with the ears up in it.

29:31.551 --> 29:33.152
(Emily)
I'm very nervous,

29:33.186 --> 29:35.454
because I love this character,

29:35.488 --> 29:38.157
but all these makeups on stage
are awesome,

29:38.191 --> 29:40.225
and I have no idea
where I stand.

29:43.596 --> 29:46.231
Tell us who made your favorite
imaginary friend

29:46.266 --> 29:48.901
tonight on Twitter
using hashtag #FaceOff

29:53.171 --> 29:54.438
This would have been a good week

29:54.472 --> 29:56.673
for her to do one of her
really fabulous big hairdos

29:56.708 --> 29:58.275
with the ears up in it.

29:58.309 --> 30:00.444
She challenged herself
to find a different shape.

30:00.478 --> 30:03.447
I actually love
that the ears sweep back.

30:06.308 --> 30:07.484
(Emily)
I'm very nervous,

30:07.519 --> 30:09.586
because I have no idea
where I stand.

30:09.621 --> 30:10.788
I'm scared.

30:12.757 --> 30:14.491
Well, hello.

30:14.526 --> 30:16.794
Who do we talk to?

30:16.828 --> 30:18.896
(Neville)
I do love the palette of this.

30:18.930 --> 30:22.699
The biggest problem is
the one-dimensional paint job.

30:22.734 --> 30:25.235
(Ve) It looks like he didn't
finish painting the eyes.

30:31.676 --> 30:32.943
I love all the shapes.

30:32.977 --> 30:34.478
It's really quite incredible.

30:34.512 --> 30:36.980
I think that the colors
are simplified

30:37.015 --> 30:38.449
to make it say,
"little kid."

30:38.483 --> 30:40.117
And these shapes
are so gorgeous.

30:43.154 --> 30:44.655
(Neville)
Mm-hmm.

30:44.689 --> 30:46.390
[roars]

30:48.960 --> 30:51.094
(Ve)
I don't think this is sculpted.

30:51.129 --> 30:52.296
Does that look sculpted?

30:52.330 --> 30:53.831
(Glenn) That's
sculpted, but this is

30:53.865 --> 30:55.265
something fabricated with latex.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.667
(Ve)
It's really good.

30:56.701 --> 30:58.502
Look at the color in there.

30:58.536 --> 31:00.137
In two days?

31:00.171 --> 31:03.140
This is a crazy amount
of work to have done.

31:07.479 --> 31:09.680
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations.

31:09.714 --> 31:11.548
Let's find out
what they thought.

31:11.583 --> 31:12.850
Emily.

31:14.219 --> 31:15.519
Logan.

31:17.155 --> 31:19.523
Congratulations,
because you are safe this week

31:19.557 --> 31:21.492
and can head
back to the makeup room.

31:21.493 --> 31:22.633
Thanks.

31:27.465 --> 31:28.866
All right, that means
the rest of you

31:28.900 --> 31:30.767
were the best and the worst
this week.

31:30.802 --> 31:32.636
And the judges
would like to speak with you

31:32.670 --> 31:34.137
to find out more
about your work.

31:34.172 --> 31:36.306
Darla, you're up.

31:39.878 --> 31:41.411
Hello.

31:42.747 --> 31:44.515
(Glenn) Why don't you
start off by telling us

31:44.549 --> 31:47.284
how your child informed
your decisions in creating this.

31:47.318 --> 31:48.619
Her imaginary friend

31:48.653 --> 31:51.121
has a sparkly blue diamond face

31:51.155 --> 31:53.357
and black buttons for eyes.

31:53.391 --> 31:57.427
I wanted to incorporate
as much of what Jordyn wanted.

31:57.462 --> 32:00.998
And this is the first time
I've really fabricated anything.

32:01.032 --> 32:03.467
So I'm really happy with it.

32:03.501 --> 32:05.068
I'm happy with it too.

32:06.504 --> 32:09.673
I really like your integration
of the diamond concept.

32:09.707 --> 32:12.576
You really got the vibe
of this challenge

32:12.610 --> 32:15.412
and did a great job
putting your skills to use

32:15.446 --> 32:17.047
and coming up with something
that fit.

32:17.081 --> 32:18.181
Thank you so much.

32:18.216 --> 32:19.816
That was a really clever way

32:19.851 --> 32:22.185
to create the button effect
with those glasses.

32:22.220 --> 32:24.988
I love the crushed stones
that you put on her chest,

32:25.023 --> 32:27.558
intermingled with your crystals
jutting out.

32:27.592 --> 32:29.426
And when she's done
with all of her diamonds,

32:29.460 --> 32:31.328
she can bring them
on over to my house,

32:31.362 --> 32:33.764
and I'd be very
happy about that.

32:33.798 --> 32:35.732
(Neville)
The fabrication is great.

32:35.767 --> 32:38.835
The implicit collar
with these crystalline forms

32:38.870 --> 32:39.836
is beautiful.

32:39.871 --> 32:41.004
It frames her nice.

32:41.039 --> 32:42.239
And the wig is a great choice
to go with,

32:42.273 --> 32:43.473
because it keeps her beautiful.

32:43.508 --> 32:44.708
Very solid character.

32:44.742 --> 32:45.809
Thank you.

32:45.843 --> 32:47.778
Darla, please step back.

32:47.812 --> 32:48.879
Thank you.

32:53.785 --> 32:55.719
Ben, please step to the center.

33:00.425 --> 33:02.893
Would you please tell us
what Blayne asked you for

33:02.927 --> 33:04.828
when he described his friend?

33:04.862 --> 33:07.931
Blayne asked
for a flying character

33:07.966 --> 33:12.669
with three heads,
no legs, and a tail.

33:12.704 --> 33:17.040
I tried to go
as cartoonish as possible.

33:17.075 --> 33:20.043
I think you certainly
got that part down.

33:20.078 --> 33:22.846
Unfortunately,
I think your main head

33:22.880 --> 33:24.982
is very one-dimensional.

33:26.684 --> 33:27.851
I'm really disappointed,

33:27.885 --> 33:29.886
because his eyes
are not finished.

33:29.921 --> 33:32.022
His paint job's not finished.

33:32.056 --> 33:34.558
It's lackluster this week.

33:34.592 --> 33:38.562
Where you may have gone wrong
is actually trying to do

33:38.596 --> 33:41.064
exactly what
the client specified.

33:41.099 --> 33:46.036
This ends up being three very
simple carnival masks on limbs,

33:46.070 --> 33:47.604
and nothing more.

33:47.639 --> 33:50.040
You simply took on
too much work.

33:50.074 --> 33:52.943
By the time you've sculpted
and molded three heads,

33:52.977 --> 33:56.380
there's very little time
to concentrate on the quality.

33:57.615 --> 33:59.483
Ben, if you'd please step down.

34:07.125 --> 34:08.891
Adam, please step forward.

34:15.199 --> 34:18.502
So tell us how Lance motivated
this character for you.

34:18.536 --> 34:22.371
Lance wanted wings, six arms,
two horns, giant monster.

34:22.407 --> 34:23.840
He wanted to name it Godzilla,

34:23.875 --> 34:26.275
but I explained what copyright
infringement was, so...

34:26.310 --> 34:29.312
[laughter]

34:29.347 --> 34:30.914
So his name is Lazor.

34:30.947 --> 34:33.116
He's a junkyard monster
that eats toys.

34:33.150 --> 34:36.085
And as he eats more,
he grows larger and larger.

34:36.120 --> 34:39.489
This was a very smart
direction to take it.

34:39.524 --> 34:42.592
Using head movement
to get this giant animation

34:42.627 --> 34:45.429
was very successful.

34:45.463 --> 34:49.632
When Barney has nightmares,
this is what it looks like.

34:49.667 --> 34:52.402
It's a very difficult thing
to utilize your skills

34:52.437 --> 34:54.103
and give us all the things
we're looking for

34:54.138 --> 34:56.373
while trying to make it
look childlike.

34:56.407 --> 34:59.142
And you did that so wonderfully
and to such great effect.

34:59.177 --> 35:00.277
Thank you.

35:00.311 --> 35:02.012
The paint on the chest,

35:02.046 --> 35:04.815
all the translucent colors,
so well done.

35:04.849 --> 35:06.983
I love the
different-sized teeth.

35:07.018 --> 35:08.685
It's really imaginative.

35:08.720 --> 35:09.820
Great job, honey.

35:09.854 --> 35:11.455
Thank you so much.

35:11.489 --> 35:13.190
Adam, you can step back.

35:18.563 --> 35:20.163
Julian, you're up.

35:27.472 --> 35:29.172
Tell us how Andrew's ideas

35:29.207 --> 35:30.907
helped you create
this character.

35:30.942 --> 35:34.144
Andrew wanted me
to make a realistic zombie

35:34.178 --> 35:35.912
with half of his face gone,

35:35.947 --> 35:37.047
and with a mohawk,

35:37.081 --> 35:38.749
and kind of
a hip-hop B-boy.

35:38.783 --> 35:41.284
So I had to come
to a happy medium

35:41.319 --> 35:44.554
by making this kid-friendly
as well as scary.

35:44.589 --> 35:46.656
I'm not terribly thrilled
with this.

35:48.359 --> 35:51.294
It lives in this space
between zombie makeup

35:51.329 --> 35:52.929
and then trying
to make it kid-like.

35:52.964 --> 35:54.164
And it didn't go far enough,

35:54.198 --> 35:57.000
so it just ends up
in this design purgatory,

35:57.034 --> 36:00.270
sculpturally and with the color.

36:00.304 --> 36:02.339
I don't believe you did
a good paint job on it.

36:02.373 --> 36:04.741
There's not enough delineation
between the sides.

36:04.776 --> 36:07.544
It's very murky where you
actually sculpted skin.

36:07.578 --> 36:08.979
I know he wanted a zombie,

36:09.013 --> 36:11.648
but this doesn't even look
like a zombie to me.

36:11.682 --> 36:14.284
There's just some odd
shape choices

36:14.318 --> 36:16.520
that don't seem to have
really much purpose,

36:16.554 --> 36:18.221
even just artistically.

36:18.256 --> 36:20.924
I just find it confusing
as a concept.

36:22.226 --> 36:23.560
Julian, thank you very much.

36:23.594 --> 36:24.594
Please step back.

36:24.629 --> 36:25.595
Thanks.

36:25.630 --> 36:26.930
Thank you, guys.

36:31.469 --> 36:33.770
Coaches, do you have anything
to say to the judges

36:33.805 --> 36:35.305
before they make
their decisions?

36:35.339 --> 36:37.207
(Anthony) Yeah, you know,
Ben's shown you guys

36:37.241 --> 36:38.608
some really incredible makeups

36:38.643 --> 36:40.710
with really strong subtleties.

36:40.745 --> 36:43.046
So knowing what he's capable of

36:43.080 --> 36:46.216
would hopefully pass him
on to the next one.

36:46.250 --> 36:47.651
I'm gonna speak out for Julian.

36:47.685 --> 36:50.420
I think he went outside his
comfort zone a lot this week.

36:50.454 --> 36:53.056
He did a good job understanding
what the kid wanted

36:53.090 --> 36:54.624
while taking in the notes
that you guys

36:54.659 --> 36:56.259
have been giving him
week after week.

36:56.294 --> 36:58.829
And he still has
a lot more to show.

36:58.863 --> 37:00.230
(McKenzie)
Well, thank you, guys.

37:00.264 --> 37:01.665
Please head back
to the makeup room

37:01.699 --> 37:03.033
while the judges deliberate.

37:08.372 --> 37:09.573
All right, judges, let's start

37:09.607 --> 37:10.974
with your favorite
looks tonight.

37:11.008 --> 37:12.609
Why don't we start
with Darla's work?

37:12.643 --> 37:14.177
(Ve) I think she did
a really great job

37:14.212 --> 37:16.046
in translating
what Jordyn asked her to do.

37:16.080 --> 37:18.882
I mean, she had the beautiful
crushed stones on the chest.

37:18.916 --> 37:20.951
(Glenn) The whole thing felt
like it really belonged

37:20.985 --> 37:22.853
in a child's film
or a child's video game.

37:22.887 --> 37:24.387
Oh, definitely.

37:24.422 --> 37:26.690
That's really what they're
trying to do in this challenge,

37:26.724 --> 37:28.758
is please the kid
but also please the judges.

37:28.793 --> 37:30.493
And that's so difficult.

37:30.528 --> 37:33.196
(Neville) She's got a
real gift at simple form,

37:33.231 --> 37:34.831
plainer shapes.

37:34.866 --> 37:36.099
It's kind of fascinating.

37:36.133 --> 37:37.534
All right, let's move on
to Adam.

37:37.568 --> 37:38.702
(Ve)
It was really clever,

37:38.736 --> 37:40.470
and the paint job was awesome.

37:40.504 --> 37:42.505
(Glenn) The head movement
was my favorite thing.

37:42.540 --> 37:43.506
It's very simple.

37:43.541 --> 37:44.875
It worked so well.

37:44.909 --> 37:47.844
He basically did everything
one man could possibly do

37:47.879 --> 37:49.446
within the time that he had.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.248
(Neville)
Adam seemed to really sum up

37:51.282 --> 37:53.483
the overall vision
of a kid character.

37:53.517 --> 37:56.419
It felt like
a full-size, walking toy.

37:56.454 --> 37:57.988
(McKenzie)
Okay, judges, let's move on

37:58.022 --> 38:00.924
to our least favorite makeups
this week.

38:00.958 --> 38:02.425
Why don't we start with Ben?

38:02.460 --> 38:04.494
(Glenn) Ben, for the
best reason possible,

38:04.528 --> 38:05.962
failed badly.

38:05.997 --> 38:08.932
He wanted to please the kid
and to do every single thing,

38:08.966 --> 38:11.201
but that literal translation
of every detail

38:11.235 --> 38:12.969
is exactly what shot him
in the foot.

38:13.004 --> 38:15.005
(Neville)
The design of the yellow head

38:15.039 --> 38:18.074
is so retro,
but not in a good way.

38:18.109 --> 38:21.611
The surface of the sculpt
is asymmetric; It's rough.

38:21.646 --> 38:23.046
I just don't think he had
enough time

38:23.080 --> 38:24.447
to paint them properly.

38:24.482 --> 38:26.917
Let's move on to Julian.

38:26.951 --> 38:28.184
(Neville)
The bone mohawk...

38:28.219 --> 38:31.254
These forms are so arbitrary
on his chin,

38:31.289 --> 38:32.689
on the back of the neck.

38:32.723 --> 38:33.924
I didn't get it.

38:33.958 --> 38:35.258
(Ve)
That is not a zombie.

38:35.293 --> 38:37.627
There's nothing about that head
that says zombie to me.

38:37.662 --> 38:40.830
It just looks like
a dilapidated mohawk skull.

38:40.865 --> 38:42.465
It never got to childlike.

38:42.500 --> 38:45.368
It just got to basic
and rough and rudimentary.

38:45.403 --> 38:47.304
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

38:47.338 --> 38:48.538
Yes, we have.

38:48.572 --> 38:50.240
Okay, let's bring them back out.

39:00.384 --> 39:02.953
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top looks.

39:02.987 --> 39:06.389
Darla, we liked the sort of
fantasy path that you took,

39:06.424 --> 39:08.191
and we thought that you did
a great job

39:08.225 --> 39:10.260
capturing your child's
imaginary friend

39:10.294 --> 39:11.728
in a very graceful way.

39:11.762 --> 39:14.264
And Adam, you found a way

39:14.298 --> 39:16.199
to embrace your client's
various wishes

39:16.233 --> 39:18.401
but still delivered
a really fun,

39:18.436 --> 39:21.104
satisfying,
and cohesive character.

39:21.138 --> 39:23.239
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

39:23.274 --> 39:25.342
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

39:31.932 --> 39:33.566
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

39:33.601 --> 39:35.468
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

39:38.739 --> 39:40.006
Adam.

39:44.178 --> 39:45.511
You managed to find a way

39:45.546 --> 39:48.514
to deliver on every front
for this challenge.

39:48.549 --> 39:49.515
Job well done.

39:49.550 --> 39:51.217
Thank you so much.

39:51.252 --> 39:53.152
(Adam voice over) I finally won
my first Spotlight Challenge.

39:53.187 --> 39:54.287
It feels good.

39:54.321 --> 39:56.055
And this is a good way
to enter the top five.

39:56.090 --> 39:57.724
Adam, congratulations.

39:57.758 --> 39:58.891
Thank you.

39:58.926 --> 40:00.893
So, Anthony, because
your last team member

40:00.928 --> 40:02.629
is on the bottom tonight,

40:02.663 --> 40:04.964
you could be eliminated as well.

40:04.999 --> 40:07.834
So you're gonna stay here
with Ben and Julian.

40:07.868 --> 40:10.270
The rest of you can head
back to the makeup room.

40:18.779 --> 40:21.347
Ben and Julian,
please step forward.

40:27.354 --> 40:29.622
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

40:29.657 --> 40:32.825
Ben, we appreciate that you
wanted to stay true

40:32.860 --> 40:34.093
to your child's vision,

40:34.128 --> 40:36.229
but you really needed
to streamline those ideas

40:36.263 --> 40:38.598
into something
that you could complete.

40:38.632 --> 40:41.434
And Julian,
though the B-boy angle made him

40:41.468 --> 40:42.869
really fun and playful,

40:42.903 --> 40:44.871
your attempt
to identify a concept

40:44.905 --> 40:48.408
within your child's ideas
fell rather flat.

40:48.442 --> 40:50.310
So who is going home tonight?

40:50.344 --> 40:52.478
The person going home tonight
is...

40:56.350 --> 40:57.617
Ben.

40:58.919 --> 41:00.386
We know how capable you are,

41:00.421 --> 41:02.588
but we just didn't
see it this week.

41:02.623 --> 41:04.023
Your sculpting and paintwork

41:04.058 --> 41:06.959
were both poor and unfinished.

41:06.994 --> 41:10.430
Ben, I'm sorry, but that means
you have been eliminated.

41:10.464 --> 41:12.498
Julian, you're safe this week

41:12.533 --> 41:14.467
and can head back
to the makeup room.

41:20.607 --> 41:21.908
Anthony, I'm so sorry,

41:21.942 --> 41:23.776
but Ben was
your last team member,

41:23.811 --> 41:26.145
which means you, too,
have been eliminated.

41:26.180 --> 41:28.715
I just want to thank you for
joining us again this season.

41:28.749 --> 41:30.016
It's always awesome

41:30.050 --> 41:31.784
to see everything
that you have to offer.

41:31.819 --> 41:33.753
Once again, you did a great job.

41:33.787 --> 41:34.921
Thank you so much.

41:34.955 --> 41:36.723
Just excited to get a chance
to work with Ben

41:36.757 --> 41:38.224
and the other members
of my team.

41:38.258 --> 41:41.627
Ben, I think you know that
I'm a huge fan of your talents.

41:41.662 --> 41:43.830
You've done some wonderful
things here.

41:43.864 --> 41:45.765
I think you're
an amazing artist.

41:45.799 --> 41:47.233
You're gonna do just fine, man.

41:47.267 --> 41:48.668
Thanks.

41:48.702 --> 41:51.971
It's been great having you both
here with us this season.

41:52.005 --> 41:54.140
But if you'd please
head back to the makeup room.

41:54.174 --> 41:55.208
Thank you both.

41:55.242 --> 41:57.276
- Thanks, guys.
- Bye.

41:57.311 --> 41:59.312
- Thank you.
- Bye, guys.

41:59.346 --> 42:00.913
Aw, buddy.

42:00.948 --> 42:02.815
- Sorry, dude.
- It's all right.

42:02.850 --> 42:04.083
I gave it my best shot.

42:04.118 --> 42:06.119
I probably went a little bigger
than I should have.

42:09.456 --> 42:10.757
It's me.

42:10.791 --> 42:12.425
Aw, brother.

42:12.459 --> 42:13.426
And him.

42:13.460 --> 42:14.427
And me.

42:14.461 --> 42:15.995
I'm most bummed not for myself,

42:16.029 --> 42:17.063
but mainly for Ben.

42:17.097 --> 42:18.831
He had it in him
to go all the way.

42:18.866 --> 42:20.066
You know, I had a hell of a run,

42:20.100 --> 42:24.103
going from former Marine,
working on helicopters.

42:24.138 --> 42:25.571
From here on out to the end,

42:25.606 --> 42:28.841
you know, I know from experience
that it's only gonna get harder.

42:28.876 --> 42:31.878
As long as each person
takes something with them

42:31.912 --> 42:33.312
that they've learned from me,

42:33.347 --> 42:34.847
then I have done my job.

42:34.882 --> 42:37.884
I'm glad to have learned
a lot from you, actually.

42:37.918 --> 42:40.086
Likewise.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.187
Yeah, man.

42:41.221 --> 42:42.889
Good run.

42:42.923 --> 42:44.791
(Ben)
Coach Anthony is the greatest,

42:44.825 --> 42:48.728
and he knew how to push me
in the right direction.

42:48.762 --> 42:50.863
This experience has been crazy.

42:50.898 --> 42:52.331
It's meant a lot to me.

42:52.366 --> 42:55.367
I put myself out there;
I stuck to my guns.

42:55.368 --> 42:56.896
I'm just gonna keep doing it.
