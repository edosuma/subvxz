Well, yes,
but what about him?

17:37.136 --> 17:39.178
Ma, I'm puttin' my foot down.

17:39.178 --> 17:42.351
We're stayin' here
and giving you
what you asked for,

17:42.351 --> 17:44.183
a night of peace and quiet.

17:44.183 --> 17:45.524
We'll see you tomorrow.

17:45.524 --> 17:46.646
But-- But--

17:46.646 --> 17:48.357
[both]
Bye, Gramma!

17:48.357 --> 17:52.071
Have fun by yourself
in that big ol' empty house!

17:52.071 --> 17:56.075
[Tilly] All alone!
Just like you wanted!

17:56.075 --> 17:58.578
[TV host]
<i>And the amount of marbles
in that shoe is--</i>

17:58.578 --> 18:01.581
<i>Wow! Just one!
What a lonely number!</i>

18:01.581 --> 18:04.203
<i>No other marbles.
How sad!</i>

18:04.203 --> 18:05.294
<i>Such a lonely marble.</i>

18:05.294 --> 18:09.298
<i>Alone! Alone! So alone!</i>

18:09.298 --> 18:11.380
Mmm!

18:15.134 --> 18:16.636
[humming]

18:16.636 --> 18:19.679
Ahem! Excuse me,
young lady.

18:19.679 --> 18:23.022
There's a rowdy country
family on the third floor,

18:23.022 --> 18:26.856
and, as a guest here,
they're ruinin' my stay!

18:26.856 --> 18:28.227
You should kick 'em out!

18:28.227 --> 18:29.609
[chuckling] Oh!

18:29.609 --> 18:32.071
I'm sorry,
but anyone can stay here

18:32.071 --> 18:34.233
and do just about anything.

18:34.233 --> 18:35.655
[shudders]

18:35.655 --> 18:37.947
Anyhoo, we'd
only send guests home

18:37.947 --> 18:41.120
if there was
something truly awful
like a rodent infestation,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.082
which would never happen.

18:43.082 --> 18:45.835
An infestation, huh?

18:48.207 --> 18:49.879
Gimme all the rats
you've got!

18:49.879 --> 18:52.341
Sorry, all outta rats.

18:52.341 --> 18:53.552
[ominous music playing]

18:53.552 --> 18:55.014
[belches]

18:55.014 --> 18:58.307
Got a special on hamsters.

18:58.307 --> 19:00.349
Gimme all the hamsters
you've got!

19:00.349 --> 19:01.470
[squeaking]

19:01.470 --> 19:02.521
Hyah!

19:03.683 --> 19:04.894
Hyuh-uh!

19:12.732 --> 19:15.324
Ha ha! This ought
to do the trick.

19:16.776 --> 19:18.407
[squeaking]

19:18.407 --> 19:21.580
I'll trade ya two soaps
for two lobby magazines.

19:21.580 --> 19:23.542
That's a no-brainer.
Done and done.

19:23.542 --> 19:24.704
-[squeaking]
-Huh? What?!

19:24.704 --> 19:26.285
What the-- ?!

19:26.285 --> 19:28.247
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

19:28.247 --> 19:29.288
Oh, my!

19:29.288 --> 19:31.290
What the-- ? Rats?!

19:31.290 --> 19:33.172
[laughing]

19:33.172 --> 19:34.423
[knock on door]

19:34.423 --> 19:36.926
The complimentary pens
you requested.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.347
-Huh?
-Well, hi, mister.

19:38.347 --> 19:41.100
Uh, you came
at a weird time.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.722
-What?!
-[squeaking]

19:42.722 --> 19:43.763
Oh, my gosh!

19:43.763 --> 19:44.974
[beeping]

19:46.065 --> 19:47.687
You brought rats with you?!

19:47.687 --> 19:51.310
This-- This is not
a pet-friendly hotel!

19:51.310 --> 19:54.483
Yes!
It's working perfectly.

19:54.483 --> 19:55.945
Papa, they're not rats.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.366
They're hamsters.

19:57.366 --> 19:59.739
Well, whatever they are,
we didn't bring 'em.

19:59.739 --> 20:01.490
What kind of hotel
is this?

20:01.490 --> 20:03.993
I'm afraid I need to ask
for our money back.

20:03.993 --> 20:05.494
Okay, please don't do that.

20:05.494 --> 20:07.496
I am so sorry
about this.

20:07.496 --> 20:09.668
I had no idea
it was the hotel's fault.

20:09.668 --> 20:11.130
How about I, um...

20:11.130 --> 20:13.462
give you an upgrade
to a better room

20:13.462 --> 20:15.174
and an extra night's stay?

20:15.174 --> 20:16.716
Complimentary?

20:16.716 --> 20:19.338
What is happening?

20:19.338 --> 20:22.261
You think you can buy
our silence?

20:22.261 --> 20:23.432
'Cause you can!

20:23.432 --> 20:25.104
Oh, good. Very good.

20:25.104 --> 20:27.556
I'll be back with hotel keys
to your new room.

20:27.556 --> 20:30.439
Wow! We get to stay
an extra night!

20:30.439 --> 20:33.272
An extra night?!

20:33.272 --> 20:35.484
Ma?! What are you doin'
out there?

20:35.484 --> 20:36.655
Get in here!

20:36.655 --> 20:38.117
Wait a sec.

20:38.117 --> 20:39.989
Did you fill our room
with hamsters?

20:39.989 --> 20:41.991
It's not even my birthday.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.363
Seriously, Ma,
it's not even Tilly's birthday.

20:44.363 --> 20:45.664
What's gotten into you?

20:45.664 --> 20:47.666
All right, all right.

20:47.666 --> 20:50.459
I'm sorry I dumped
a bunch of hamsters
into your room.

20:50.459 --> 20:52.501
I was tryin'
to infest the hotel

20:52.501 --> 20:54.253
so they'd send you home.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.966
-But why?
-'Cause I missed ya,
that's why!

20:56.966 --> 21:00.139
I thought I was happier
before the family moved in,

21:00.139 --> 21:03.552
but the truth is,
it was lonely and quiet,

21:03.552 --> 21:05.594
and I'd rather
not go back to that.

21:05.594 --> 21:07.977
I'm glad you're
livin' with me now.

21:07.977 --> 21:09.478
Will you come home?

21:09.478 --> 21:11.480
-Nope.
-What?

21:11.480 --> 21:13.352
Heartless!

21:13.352 --> 21:15.354
We're gettin' a free
upgraded hotel suite.

21:15.354 --> 21:16.816
We're not goin' home.

21:16.816 --> 21:18.988
But, Ma, we'd love it
if you'd join us.

21:18.988 --> 21:21.070
That'd be wonderful.

21:21.070 --> 21:22.451
Good. Now get in here.

21:22.451 --> 21:24.073
You're makin' me nervous.

21:24.073 --> 21:26.245
[Cricket]
Hey, Gramma, you want
a complimentary hamster?

21:26.245 --> 21:27.787
[Gramma] No, boy,
I brought them here.

21:27.787 --> 21:28.828
