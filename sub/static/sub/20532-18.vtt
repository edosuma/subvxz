00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.610 --> 00:12.711
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.713 --> 00:14.980
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.982 --> 00:17.716
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.718 --> 00:20.052
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:20.054 --> 00:22.688
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.690 --> 00:25.557
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.559 --> 00:29.528
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.530 --> 00:33.565
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.567 --> 00:36.568
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.570 --> 00:38.237
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.239 --> 00:40.672
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.674 --> 00:43.075
¶ Sofia ¶

00:43.077 --> 00:45.577
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.579 --> 00:51.650
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

01:01.896 --> 01:03.495
I could've sworn
I left it here.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.597
Sofia, would you look
behind the couch?

01:05.599 --> 01:08.000
[Sofia] No, not here.

01:08.002 --> 01:10.936
Where did I put
my white necktie?

01:10.938 --> 01:13.338
I wear it to all
big events in Dunwiddie.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.941
And the opening of
the Dunwiddie museum today

01:15.943 --> 01:17.776
will be one of the biggest
of all, Your Majesty.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.578
I can't wait to see

01:19.580 --> 01:21.613
the Crowns of
the Kingdoms exhibit.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.783
I also heard there will be
jiggly-wiggly pudding.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.618
Don't think I haven't
heard the same.

01:26.620 --> 01:30.756
Your Highness, allow me to
conjure you a new necktie.

01:30.758 --> 01:34.026
That's quite all right, Cedric.
This one will be fine.

01:34.028 --> 01:36.728
Would you like to go over
your speech for the museum
opening, Your Majesty?

01:36.730 --> 01:39.198
Good idea.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.033
I have a spell
that can help you

01:41.035 --> 01:42.801
instantly memorize
the entire speech, sire.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.570
That won't be necessary.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.738
- I have it written
down right here.
- [stammering]

01:46.740 --> 01:49.541
That will be all, Cedric.
Thank you.

01:49.543 --> 01:52.644
As you wish, sire.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.612
Mr. Cedric.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.382
Are you okay?

01:57.384 --> 01:59.785
Not really, princess.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.753
Your father has wanted
nothing to do with me

02:01.755 --> 02:04.723
ever since I froze
your family with
the standstill stone.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.758
And tried to take over
the kingdom.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.794
No need to remind me.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.830
I shall never forget
those shameful actions.

02:11.832 --> 02:14.666
It seems like my dad's
having a hard time
forgetting, too.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.736
Perhaps he shall
never get over it.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.771
It makes me so sad.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.474
Roland and I shared
a special bond when
we were lads.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.009
- You did?
- Oh, yes.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.644
Growing up together
in this castle

02:25.646 --> 02:28.780
in the shadows of
our larger-than-life fathers.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.916
When the pressure
became too great,

02:30.918 --> 02:33.819
we'd escape to the fields
and play dazzle ball.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.621
What are you two doing
in this painting?

02:35.623 --> 02:38.991
Oh, that's a special play
he and I invented together.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.826
The royal ricochet.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.761
[imitates ricochet sound]

02:42.763 --> 02:44.796
Oh, but ever since
that fateful day

02:44.798 --> 02:46.965
I let your family down,

02:46.967 --> 02:49.501
whatever trust Roland
once had in me, I fear
is gone forever.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.170
Then I'll help you
get it back.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.672
Come see the crown exhibit
with me and my dad today.

02:53.674 --> 02:57.176
How will browsing jewels
get me back in your father's
good graces?

02:57.178 --> 02:59.978
It'll be like two
friends spending
a whole afternoon together.

02:59.980 --> 03:03.048
Mm. Lots of chances for him
to disapprove of me.

03:03.050 --> 03:05.884
Lots of chances for you to show
him you can be trusted again,

03:05.886 --> 03:07.819
like when you were kids.

03:07.821 --> 03:11.023
I suppose
it's worth a try.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.059
Wormy, this may be my chance

03:14.061 --> 03:16.461
to get back on
the king's good side.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.463
Well, you can do it
without me.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.065
But I need you there.

03:20.067 --> 03:23.068
Your knowledge of crowns
will help me impress
King Roland.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.737
I only passed crownology
back at Hexley Hall

03:25.739 --> 03:28.707
because you were
my study buddy.
Remember?

03:28.709 --> 03:33.478
Ten points if you can
identify these famous crowns.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.814
Crown of Corinthia,
the Diadem of DunBroch,

03:35.816 --> 03:37.716
and the Tangu-vian Tiara.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.152
But I still refuse
to go with you,

03:40.154 --> 03:42.387
you goody-goody.

03:42.389 --> 03:46.358
I've turned a new page
in the spell book, Wormy,
you know that,

03:46.360 --> 03:48.827
but I am still
your master,

03:48.829 --> 03:51.029
and I say
you're coming with me.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.031
Yes... master.

03:53.033 --> 03:56.335
Whatever you wish...
master.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.403
[squawks]

04:00.941 --> 04:03.375
And with that,
I hereby declare

04:03.377 --> 04:07.079
the Dunwiddie Museum
officially open!

04:08.115 --> 04:11.183
Now come enjoy
the spectacular

04:11.185 --> 04:14.620
Crowns of
the Kingdoms exhibit.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.368
I bet my dad would
love to have a friend

04:29.370 --> 04:31.570
to see the exhibit with.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.405
And I shall try
to be that friend.

04:33.407 --> 04:37.309
But first, Wormy, tell me
a tidbit about that crown.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.811
Some factoid with
real wow factor.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.880
The Wreath of Rudistan,

04:41.882 --> 04:44.950
made of phoenix feather
filigree and the finest
elven gold.

04:44.952 --> 04:48.587
Thank you. Time to
win over the king-y wing-y.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.456
"King-y wing-y"?
Ugh!

04:51.458 --> 04:53.325
Silly villagers.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.727
A powerful magic crown
hiding in plain sight,

04:55.729 --> 04:57.296
and they don't
even know it.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.798
Uh, Prisma, we don't even
know which one

04:59.800 --> 05:01.800
is Snow White
stepmom's crown.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.769
What was her name again?

05:03.771 --> 05:07.973
Grimhilde, and this
is her crown.

05:07.975 --> 05:12.844
The powerful Wicked Nine
object you've come to steal.

05:12.846 --> 05:17.316
Steal? Well, that's not
very goody-goody at all.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.518
Got it. Now let's
go nab it

05:19.520 --> 05:22.120
in one humdinger
of a heist. Ha ha!

05:22.122 --> 05:26.758
Oh. Finding Grimhilde's crown
may take longer than we thought.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.494
Ready to go
talk to my dad,
friend to friend?

05:29.496 --> 05:31.296
I have the perfect
bit of knowledge

05:31.298 --> 05:34.666
to get the conversation
rolling, no pun intended.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.803
Sire, did you know

05:37.805 --> 05:40.272
this crown is made
of phoenix gold?

05:40.274 --> 05:42.207
Oh, is that so?

05:42.209 --> 05:45.010
Lord Stiv, greetings.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.880
Did you know this crown
is made of phoenix gold?

05:48.882 --> 05:50.716
That is quite untrue, sire.

05:50.718 --> 05:55.320
I happen to know that
it is made of elven gold.

05:55.322 --> 05:57.055
Oh.
[nervous chuckle]

05:57.057 --> 05:59.324
I beg your pardon.

05:59.326 --> 06:03.729
That's the last time
I rely on your knowledge
of crownology, Cedric.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.698
I misspoke, sire.
It was an accident.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.533
Oh, this isn't working.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.570
Your father is unimpressed
and still untrusting.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.872
Okay, winning him over
may be a little harder
than I thought.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.879
Maybe you just need to do
something really sweet for him.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.748
Come on.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.550
Oh, could that be
Grimhilde's crown?

06:25.552 --> 06:27.252
Princess Sofia?!

06:27.254 --> 06:29.955
Ugh, we can't
let her see us.
Come on.

06:39.933 --> 06:43.235
No way is that princess
gonna stop us again.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.103
Oh, I agree.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.938
We must get all of
the Wicked Nine.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.007
Then I can
drain their power,

06:49.009 --> 06:51.109
and become
oh so powerful.

06:51.111 --> 06:54.679
How can we swipe the crown
without Sofia spottin' us?

06:54.681 --> 06:56.581
Excuse me,

06:56.583 --> 06:59.384
but I do believe that
I can be of some
service to you

06:59.386 --> 07:01.753
- in this endeavor.
- And who are you?

07:01.755 --> 07:04.089
Allow me to introduce
myself, my dear.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.057
My name, Wormwood.

07:06.059 --> 07:09.761
My aim, to aid you in
this wonderfully wicked theft

07:09.763 --> 07:11.930
- I heard you plotting.
- Why? What's in it for you?

07:11.932 --> 07:14.566
My current master
is such a do-gooder now.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.968
I long for some
good old-fashioned scheming.

07:16.970 --> 07:20.138
Would you be so kind as to
let me join your evil band?

07:20.140 --> 07:24.109
It's a nice story,
but we can find the crown
on our own, thank you.

07:24.111 --> 07:27.546
Did I mention
I'm an expert in crownology?

07:27.548 --> 07:32.050
I can locate Grimhilde's coronet
before you can say boo-hoo.

07:32.052 --> 07:36.755
And you won't have to worry
about the princess spotting you.

07:36.757 --> 07:41.159
Okay. I'll make
you a deal, Wormwood.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.595
You steal Grimhilde's crown,

07:43.597 --> 07:46.798
then meet me at the old cabin
in the woods outside town.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.100
You mean the old cabin
with the crooked chimney?

07:49.102 --> 07:51.236
[giggles]
That's the one.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.138
Once the crown
is in my hands,

07:53.140 --> 07:57.108
and only then, I'll consider
letting you join us.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.444
I am honored for the chance

07:59.446 --> 08:03.014
to connive and steal
for you, my lady.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.749
What are you doin'?

08:04.751 --> 08:06.651
We don't need
some looney bird
on our team.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.921
Oh, Twitch,
are you jealous?

08:09.923 --> 08:11.857
Actually, yeah, a bit.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.159
But I'm also worried.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.361
How do we know we can
trust that sack of feathers?

08:16.363 --> 08:19.498
That's why I want you
to follow him, silly.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.001
Make sure he delivers
the crown like he says he will.

08:23.003 --> 08:26.671
Oh, right.
I'm on it.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.640
So I just gotta make sure

08:28.642 --> 08:30.876
that raven doesn't
deliver the goods.

08:30.878 --> 08:35.046
Then I'll be Prisma's
one and only partner in crime.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.283
My dad would really
love it if you brought
him some...

08:38.285 --> 08:40.285
Jiggly-wiggly pudding.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.887
Oh, the king's favorite.

08:41.889 --> 08:45.056
One pudding for
the king, please, my good man.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.858
Um, I'm so sorry, sir.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.226
I just sold my last cup.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.228
No more pudding?

08:50.230 --> 08:53.231
Luckily, Dad, Mr. Cedric
can conjure you some.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.201
Superb idea, princess.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.502
Dessertius wigglius!

08:57.504 --> 09:01.306
Yummy! Nicely done, Cedric.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.875
Thank you, Your Majesty.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.443
[man] Did someone
say pudding?

09:06.980 --> 09:08.246
Cedric!

09:08.248 --> 09:10.882
I'm so sorry,
Your Majesty.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.184
It wasn't
his fault, Dad.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.554
Someone bumped into me,
and I bumped into Mr. Cedric.

09:15.556 --> 09:16.888
Let me clean it, sire.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.723
Stainius removius!

09:18.725 --> 09:20.392
Cedric!

09:20.394 --> 09:23.528
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, I am so sorry.

09:23.530 --> 09:26.164
I'll conjure you
a new outfit right away.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.099
[stammering]
Vestimento novio!

09:29.703 --> 09:32.437
Cedric, are you trying to
make a laughingstock of me?

09:32.439 --> 09:35.173
Oh, my deepest
apologies, Your Majesty.

09:35.175 --> 09:38.577
I'm just nervous.
Here, let me try
that spell again.

09:38.579 --> 09:41.279
No. No, no.
No more magic,
please.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.949
I have a change of clothes
in the coach.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.886
[Wormy] Five-pointed
with a pearl.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.187
Looks very evil stepmother-y.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.122
That is it!

09:51.124 --> 09:52.591
Oh, please.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.434
Let's see him get past
those two, huh.

10:09.443 --> 10:10.942
[squawks]

10:10.944 --> 10:12.811
Stay right there, boys.

10:24.558 --> 10:25.657
No!

10:29.296 --> 10:31.830
[Roland laughing]

10:31.832 --> 10:34.499
I knew I'd find
my lucky white necktie.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.835
My lord, there's
been a theft.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.937
What? Did you see
the thief?

10:38.939 --> 10:42.340
No, sire, but we did
find this.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.943
A raven's feather?

10:44.945 --> 10:47.345
- [squawking]
- With a crown?

10:47.347 --> 10:48.780
Is that Wormwood?

10:48.782 --> 10:52.117
Your Majesty, I just
saw Wormwood flying off

10:52.119 --> 10:55.320
- with a very important crown.
- Did you?

10:55.322 --> 10:57.589
I wonder what my royal sorcerer
has to say about this.

10:57.591 --> 10:59.758
What's going on?

10:59.760 --> 11:03.161
It seems, while you
distracted me with
that pudding fiasco,

11:03.163 --> 11:06.698
your raven went and stole
a precious crown from
this exhibit.

11:06.700 --> 11:10.368
Wormwood? No.
Why would he do that?

11:10.370 --> 11:14.205
All I know is that
this was found at
the scene of the crime.

11:14.207 --> 11:17.776
Sire, I have no idea
what's going on,

11:17.778 --> 11:20.345
but in no way did I put
Wormwood up to this.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.714
I have no need for a crown.

11:22.716 --> 11:26.017
Forgive me if I don't
quite believe you, Cedric.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.287
Dad, Mr. Cedric
wouldn't do something
like this.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.388
Not anymore.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.057
Would he?

11:32.059 --> 11:33.525
Unfortunately, Sofia,

11:33.527 --> 11:35.694
people don't change
as easily as you think.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.630
Alert the rest
of the guards.

11:38.632 --> 11:40.398
I want search parties
sent out.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.400
Right away,
Your Majesty.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.171
Pardon me for
intruding, sire,

11:46.173 --> 11:49.174
but how will the guards
even know where to look
for Wormwood?

11:49.176 --> 11:51.176
May I see that feather?

11:51.178 --> 11:52.410
I can cast a spell on it

11:52.412 --> 11:54.212
to help us track
where Wormwood went.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.081
Fine. Go ahead.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.852
Plumius navigatio!

12:00.854 --> 12:03.421
- It's like a compass.
- Yes, of sorts.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.256
It should point
the way to its owner.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.258
[guard] Come on, men.
Back to the castle.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.728
We need reinforcements!

12:11.765 --> 12:13.898
Wormwood is heading
that way.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.667
It's too late
to tell the guards.

12:15.669 --> 12:17.368
They're going
the wrong way.

12:17.370 --> 12:20.205
We shall have to go
catch him on our own then.

12:20.207 --> 12:23.441
You'd really lead me
to the accomplice
in your own crime?

12:23.443 --> 12:26.411
Sire, if I had plotted
this theft with Wormwood,

12:26.413 --> 12:29.247
it would be madness to help
you find him, wouldn't it?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.850
If Mr. Cedric helps
get the stolen crown back,

12:31.852 --> 12:34.419
it will prove
he's on your side, Dad.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.254
All right.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.423
But should my suspicions
be confirmed,

12:38.425 --> 12:41.359
I'm afraid it's to
the dungeons with you, Cedric.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.727
[gulps]

12:42.729 --> 12:45.296
Fair enough,
Your Majesty.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.298
Keep going, Wormwood.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.368
No pain,
no gain a new master.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.447
[panting]

13:02.449 --> 13:05.083
Oh, what now?

13:05.085 --> 13:08.286
Oh, that hunk of crown
too heavy for ya?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.455
Excuse me?

13:11.491 --> 13:13.491
Relax. It's me,

13:13.493 --> 13:15.560
and I'd be happy to bring
the crown to Prisma,

13:15.562 --> 13:17.162
if you can't
hack it.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.831
No shame in droppin' out.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.400
I can bring it myself,
thank you very much.

13:29.075 --> 13:32.110
Cedric, if you're leading us
into some sort of trap...

13:32.112 --> 13:34.345
I promise,
Your Highness,
I am not.

13:34.347 --> 13:38.583
What can I say to make
you believe I'm on your side?

13:38.585 --> 13:40.852
I'm not sure there's
anything you can say.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.320
Then maybe he can show you.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.422
Right!

13:44.424 --> 13:47.325
I'll show you
over and over.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.594
Sooner or later,
you have to see,

13:49.596 --> 13:52.664
I can be trusted.

13:52.666 --> 13:56.467
¶ I've said sorry
again and again ¶

13:56.469 --> 13:58.136
¶ For my past wrongs ¶

13:58.138 --> 14:01.639
¶ And for the man
I was back then ¶

14:01.641 --> 14:05.510
¶ But still there's a wall
around your heart ¶

14:05.512 --> 14:07.178
¶ So brick by brick ¶

14:07.180 --> 14:10.448
¶ I'll try to break
that wall apart ¶

14:10.450 --> 14:12.617
¶ I'll lend
a millions hands ¶

14:12.619 --> 14:15.019
¶ I'll bridge
the great divide ¶

14:15.021 --> 14:19.357
¶ Jump through a million hoops
until you're satisfied ¶

14:19.359 --> 14:24.162
¶ That I am on your side ¶

14:24.164 --> 14:30.235
¶ Yes, I am
on your side ¶

14:30.370 --> 14:34.539
¶ I see Wormwood
up there in the sky ¶

14:34.541 --> 14:39.544
¶ Now aren't ya glad
we gave Cedric's way a try? ¶

14:39.546 --> 14:43.548
¶ I want your forgiveness
for all that mess ¶

14:43.550 --> 14:46.484
¶ But I want to prove
that I deserve it ¶

14:46.486 --> 14:47.819
¶ More than less ¶

14:47.821 --> 14:51.022
¶ I'll lend
a million hands ¶

14:51.024 --> 14:52.924
¶ I'll bridge
the great divide ¶

14:52.926 --> 14:57.428
¶ Jump through a million hoops
until you're satisfied ¶

14:57.430 --> 15:01.766
¶ That I am on your side ¶

15:01.768 --> 15:07.005
¶ Yes, I am on your side ¶

15:07.007 --> 15:11.009
¶ Do you remember when ¶

15:11.011 --> 15:13.411
¶ We were like a team? ¶

15:13.413 --> 15:15.446
¶ You had my back ¶

15:15.448 --> 15:18.082
¶ It was better
than any dream ¶

15:18.084 --> 15:22.086
¶ What's in pieces
can still be repaired ¶

15:22.088 --> 15:24.522
¶ It's not too late
to fix the friendship ¶

15:24.524 --> 15:27.292
¶ You once shared ¶

15:27.294 --> 15:31.462
¶ And so I'll lend
a million hands ¶

15:31.464 --> 15:33.264
¶ I'll bridge
the great divide ¶

15:33.266 --> 15:35.433
¶ Jump through
a million hoops ¶

15:35.435 --> 15:38.102
¶ Until you're satisfied ¶

15:38.104 --> 15:41.606
¶ That I am on your side ¶

15:41.608 --> 15:43.875
¶ I'm starting to see
that you are on... ¶

15:43.877 --> 15:46.444
¶ I am on
your side ¶

15:46.446 --> 15:49.113
¶ My side ¶

15:49.115 --> 15:51.249
¶ My side ¶

15:51.251 --> 15:55.620
¶ My side! ¶

16:02.829 --> 16:06.197
Rats. I can't let him
get that crown to Prisma.

16:13.173 --> 16:16.140
So I'll just
slow him down a bit.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.476
Oh, boy, would that sting.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.546
Wait for it,
wait for it.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.954
Oh, no.
You nasty creatures.

16:29.956 --> 16:32.757
Shoo! Shoo, all of you.
Get away.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.560
[Wormwood exclaiming]

16:36.930 --> 16:40.331
Oh, what on earth
is Wormwood doing?

16:40.333 --> 16:41.699
Something isn't right.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.935
I'll go on ahead
and see what's wrong.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.946
[Wormwood yelling]

16:54.948 --> 16:56.247
Get away!

17:00.320 --> 17:03.187
Worm, hand over
that crown.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.956
I will not.

17:04.958 --> 17:08.026
I am your master.
You must.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.628
You won't be
my master much longer, Cedric.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.897
You are leaving me?

17:12.899 --> 17:14.632
You're too nice now.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.467
I miss the old Cedric.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.002
The Cedric who used
to plot day and night

17:18.004 --> 17:20.204
to take over
the kingdom.

17:20.206 --> 17:23.641
And that's more important
to you than our friendship?

17:23.643 --> 17:26.244
Only a million times
so, my dear boy.

17:26.246 --> 17:30.148
What do I care if you're
buddy-buddy with the king?

17:30.150 --> 17:31.983
What power will
that give me?

17:31.985 --> 17:35.853
Hopefully, Wormwood, it won't
give you any power at all.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.588
[yells]

17:37.590 --> 17:39.724
[straining]

17:41.261 --> 17:44.996
Hand over the crown,
you back-stabbing raven.

17:44.998 --> 17:47.565
Not if my life
depended on it,

17:47.567 --> 17:48.833
you goody two-shoes.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.603
Ha! Good riddance, Wormy.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.572
You are no longer needed.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.009
The crown is mine!

17:58.011 --> 18:00.111
- Mr. Cedric!
- Cedric!

18:03.349 --> 18:05.316
[squawks]

18:07.087 --> 18:08.319
No!

18:10.723 --> 18:12.423
Oh, Your Highness,
you let him get away.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.359
At least I've got the mastermind
behind this heist.

18:15.361 --> 18:16.461
Me?

18:16.463 --> 18:18.096
You just admitted it.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.531
You want the crown
all to yourself.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.301
I was only trying
to get it from Wormwood,

18:23.303 --> 18:25.103
the real thief.
Sofia?

18:25.105 --> 18:27.038
I don't know,
Mr. Cedric.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.639
You were holding
the crown.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.876
And just when I was starting
to trust you again.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.644
You can spend the night
in the dungeons

18:33.646 --> 18:35.680
till this is sorted out.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.486
Huh. Looks like
the raven's a no-show.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.721
Guess it's just
you and me, Prisma.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.657
Dastardly greetings,
my lady.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.726
What? How did you
get here?

18:48.728 --> 18:52.630
May I present you
Grimhilde's crown?

18:52.632 --> 18:53.965
You did it!

18:53.967 --> 18:57.435
The crown is ours!
Wonderful teamwork.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.804
So you're sayin'
he's part of the team now?

18:59.806 --> 19:02.006
Yes. Of course.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.308
I always keep my word.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.977
I can't believe it.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.646
It's really ours.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.682
Beware, Prisma. When that crown
catches the light

19:11.684 --> 19:13.351
at just the right angle,

19:13.353 --> 19:15.686
it creates
earth-shattering lightning.

19:15.688 --> 19:18.156
Sounds delightful!

19:18.158 --> 19:21.792
[Prisma and Wormwood
laughing]

19:21.794 --> 19:23.594
Yeah.
[laughs]

19:23.596 --> 19:25.830
[all laughing]

19:27.467 --> 19:29.534
Cedric, your wand, please.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.369
Fine.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.037
I will need it back.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.776
[cackling laughter]

19:41.848 --> 19:43.414
Oh, no.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.886
- Where's Sofia?
- Prisma.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.322
Princess Sofia.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.724
You can hand that over,
or I can call the Protectors.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.726
Your choice.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.895
Hand over one of
the Wicked Nine?

19:57.897 --> 19:59.997
I don't love that idea,

19:59.999 --> 20:02.233
but I do love this one.

20:03.236 --> 20:06.037
Huh, funny weather
we're having, isn't it?

20:06.039 --> 20:07.872
Sofia, there you are.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.241
The crown!

20:10.243 --> 20:12.743
Not so fast,
my dear king.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.345
Triton's toothbrush!

20:14.347 --> 20:16.247
Take cover!

20:16.249 --> 20:18.182
Sire, my wand.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.384
- I can stop
this villainess.
- Right.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.421
I can't get to you.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.057
Oh, just toss it over.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.358
How?

20:27.360 --> 20:29.260
The royal ricochet.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.762
The royal ricochet!

20:32.699 --> 20:34.865
- Got it!
- Well played.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.400
Powerum beamio!

20:37.870 --> 20:39.804
How do you like
those apples?

20:43.543 --> 20:45.576
Now then, princess,

20:45.578 --> 20:47.445
you have been
a thorn in my side

20:47.447 --> 20:49.113
once too often.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.885
Oh, no!

20:54.887 --> 20:56.854
Hang on, princess!

20:56.856 --> 20:58.256
Mr. Cedric!

21:04.864 --> 21:07.565
We got what we came for.
Let's go.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.900
Sofia?

21:09.902 --> 21:11.435
Oh, you're okay.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.737
Thank goodness.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.538
Dad!

21:14.540 --> 21:15.773
Oh, where's Mr. Cedric?

21:15.775 --> 21:18.943
Cedric? Cedric.
Where are you?

21:18.945 --> 21:20.945
Oh, you don't think...

21:20.947 --> 21:22.113
Mr. Cedric.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.749
Look, there, in the rubble.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.218
Quick, Sofia, help me
pull him out.

21:27.220 --> 21:29.654
Is the princess safe?

21:32.558 --> 21:34.659
I can't believe
how you saved me like that.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.894
You could've gotten
really hurt.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.330
So could you, Sofia.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.998
Cedric.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.566
I know.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.168
Off to the dungeon.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.504
I was wrong
about you.

21:46.506 --> 21:49.807
You sacrificed
your own safety
for Sofia.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.943
That means more to me
than you will ever know.

21:52.945 --> 21:55.579
It's so wonderful
to hear that.

21:55.581 --> 21:57.915
I'm sorry the crown's
been lost.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.518
Who was that woman anyway?

22:00.520 --> 22:04.088
I don't know,
but at least,
we're all okay.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.290
Oh, what a mess.

22:06.292 --> 22:08.292
Cedric, do you
have a spell

22:08.294 --> 22:10.728
to return this all
to normal?

22:13.833 --> 22:15.900
Terra refurba!

22:21.874 --> 22:23.474
Excellent job...

22:23.476 --> 22:26.177
old friend.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.713
Vega, Orion.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.048
It's Prisma.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.851
She has one of
the Wicked Nine.
