WEBVTT

00:04.360 --> 00:07.079
I love when the car place
puts that paper mat on the floor.

00:07.240 --> 00:10.038
Like they're so obsessed
with cleanliness.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.430
They don't even want their shoes
to touch the carpet.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.955
The mechanic comes out,
he looks like Al Jolson.

00:15.120 --> 00:18.795
He's covered in goo from head to toe.
You can't even see him.

00:19.160 --> 00:22.277
I prefer that to when they have the
lab coat, the clipboard, the glasses.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.396
Now you know
you're getting screwed.

00:24.960 --> 00:25.949
"Can I see it?"

00:26.120 --> 00:28.918
"You better not.
It's idling quietly right now.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.513
I think it should stay overnight.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.752
We want to keep an eye on it,
and want to keep the bill running up."

00:39.960 --> 00:42.030
Tell the players that
I reimbursed the trainer...

00:42.200 --> 00:43.679
...for the cigarettes and shakes.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.990
-The players will be reimbursed?
-The trainer.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.957
Tell the players
I reimbursed the trainer.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.430
This is the third time
I've had to repeat myself.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.352
-Sorry.
-Sorry doesn't cut it.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.112
We're running
a ball club here, George.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.157
You've got to pay attention.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.594
I know. It won't happen again.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.479
Let me see.
I had an assignment for you.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.993
Let me-- Let me think here.

01:11.880 --> 01:13.074
Elaine.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.514
Hi, Mr. Peterman.

01:14.680 --> 01:18.116
You know what a huge fan
I am of John F. Kennedy.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.793
I do.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.315
The Peace Corps gave me
my start in this business.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.711
Clothing the naked natives
of Bangtubesh.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.359
The Pygmy pullover.

01:29.640 --> 01:32.234
Sotheby's is having an auction
of JFK's memorabilia.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.358
One item in particular
has caught my eye.

01:35.520 --> 01:36.999
The presidential golf clubs.

01:37.560 --> 01:41.712
To me, they capture that indefinable
romance that was Camelot.

01:41.880 --> 01:42.869
Whatever.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.235
Unfortunately, I will be
out of town with my lady...

01:45.400 --> 01:47.311
...and therefore unable
to bid on the lot.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.277
I was hoping you would go
in my stead.

01:49.440 --> 01:52.193
Oh, yeah. I'd be happy to.

01:52.360 --> 01:56.672
How much do you want this thing?
How high are you willing to go?

01:56.840 --> 02:01.231
I would see no trouble in spending
up to, say, $10,000.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.998
Have my secretary give you a check.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.349
--when you're done, George,
and bring it directly to me.

02:12.520 --> 02:15.353
Mr. Steinbrenner is
very interested in this.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.431
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, George.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.716
I want you to make this project
a top priority.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.518
I will, sir. Top priority.

02:22.680 --> 02:25.240
-Top priority, George.
-Top priority.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.079
So he walks out of the stall.
He's been talking the whole time.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.356
-He pulled an LBJ on you.
-LBJ?

02:35.520 --> 02:37.875
Lyndon Johnson used to do that
to his staffers.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.029
-No kidding?
-Oh, yeah.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.111
He'd hold national security
meetings in there.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.670
He planned the Hanoi bombing
after a bad Thai meal.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.918
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.832
I don't even know
what my assignment is.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.070
Ask him to repeat it.
Tell him there was an echo.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.549
I can't. He's been on me
about not paying attention.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.790
It's too late.
I already told him I heard him.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.789
You know what you do?
Ask him a follow-up question.

02:58.960 --> 03:02.032
Tell him you're having trouble getting
started, and you want his advice.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.879
Yeah, follow-up question.
That'll work.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.315
-Hey, bud.
-Hey.

03:07.480 --> 03:08.629
-Can I have my keys--
-Yeah.

03:08.800 --> 03:09.869
--back please.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.315
-You should have come, Jerry.
-We made quite a haul.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.436
-Where did you go?
-Price Club.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.319
-Why didn't you take your car?
-Oh, the steering wheel fell off.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.675
I don't know where it is.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.592
What are you doing?
Don't throw that away.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.672
Well, I'm not paying the 5 cents
for that stupid recycling thing.

03:24.840 --> 03:27.195
You don't pay 5 cents.
You get 5 cents back.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.349
Read the label.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.590
"Vermont, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, New York.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.193
Refund, 5 cents."

03:32.360 --> 03:33.554
-Refund?
-Yeah.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.029
Well, what do you think
the hobos are doing?

03:36.200 --> 03:38.873
I don't know. They're deranged.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.995
Listen. Can you give me
a lift back to my place?

03:42.160 --> 03:45.630
No, I can't. I've gotta pick up Elaine.
I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.995
-All right. I'll see you later.
-All right.

03:48.160 --> 03:51.391
-What is this "Ml, 10 cents"?
-That's Michigan.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.073
In Michigan you get 10 cents.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.434
-Ten cents?
-Yeah.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.319
Wait a minute, you mean you get
5 cents here and 10 cents there?

03:57.480 --> 03:59.710
You could round up bottles
and run them to Michigan.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.552
-No, it doesn't work.
-What do you mean?

04:01.720 --> 04:02.755
You get enough bottles--

04:02.920 --> 04:05.912
You overload your inventory, and you
blow your margins on gasoline.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.229
Trust me. It doesn't work.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.960
You're not talking that Michigan
deposit-bottle scam?

04:10.120 --> 04:12.111
-No, I'm off that.
-You tried it?

04:12.280 --> 04:14.669
Oh, yeah. Every which way.
Couldn't crunch the numbers.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.512
It drove me crazy.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.113
You keep an eye on each other?

04:20.279 --> 04:21.632
-No problem.
-You bet.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.033
Are you sure you didn't hear
my car making a funny noise?

04:32.200 --> 04:34.077
I know those two idiots did
something to it.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.674
No, I didn't hear anything.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.039
Oh, my God. Look who's here.

04:40.200 --> 04:45.718
Sue Ellen Mischke, the braless,
Oh Henry! candy bar heiress.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.874
Well, hello, Elaine, Jerry.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.792
-Hi, Sue Ellen.
-Hi, Sue Ellen.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.473
I'm surprised to see you here.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.631
Come to catch a glimpse
of high society?

05:00.080 --> 05:03.436
No, no, I'm actually here to bid,
Sue Ellen.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.431
I mean,
that is if anything's to my liking.

05:05.960 --> 05:09.748
I'm here to catch
a glimpse of high society.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.514
Well, I hope you find something
that fits your budget.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.592
I hate that woman.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.029
I don't understand.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.268
You fill an 18-wheeler.

05:24.440 --> 05:27.079
No, an 18-wheeler's no good.
Too much overhead.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.470
You got permits,
weigh stations, tolls.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.471
Look, you're way out of your league.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.598
I wanna learn.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.228
I want to know why.

05:42.280 --> 05:44.999
Oh, those are handsome.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.593
Look at that set.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.433
Yeah, think I might bid on those.

05:50.360 --> 05:52.191
Lot number 745.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.191
We have a full set of golf clubs...

05:54.360 --> 05:56.828
...that were owned
by President John F. Kennedy...

05:57.000 --> 06:00.834
...as seen in the famous photo of the
president chipping at Burning Tree...

06:01.000 --> 06:02.911
...on the morning
of the Bay of Pigs lnvasion.

06:03.080 --> 06:08.677
The set is in perfect condition,
and we will start the biding at $4000.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.434
Four thousand dollars?
Do I have $4000? I have $4000.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.751
Do I have 5? Five thousand dollars?
I have $5000. Do I have 6?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.434
Six thousand dollars
for this set of beautiful clubs.

06:17.600 --> 06:21.115
Six? I have $6000.
Can I have 6500?

06:21.480 --> 06:25.234
Sixty-five hundred
to the dark-haired person on the right.

06:25.720 --> 06:29.076
We are at 6500.
Do I hear 6600?

06:29.240 --> 06:31.310
The president's own golf clubs.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.232
Leisure life at Camelot.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.072
Sixty-five hundred going once.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.549
Eight thousand.

06:36.720 --> 06:41.396
Eight thousand. We have 8000.
The bid is now $8000.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.073
What is she doing?

06:43.240 --> 06:45.879
She's starting in on the biding now?

06:46.040 --> 06:47.393
Eighty-five hundred.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.120
-We have 85.
-Nine thousand.

06:50.280 --> 06:51.952
Nine thousand dollars.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.314
I think she wants those clubs.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.835
Do I hear 95?
Ninety-five hundred.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.230
-Ninety-five hundred.
-Ten thousand.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.037
Ten thousand
to the shapely woman on the left.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.758
Ten thousand going once.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.434
-That's you're ceiling.
-Ten thousand going twice.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.830
-Eleven thousand.
-Twelve thousand.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.629
-Thirteen thousand.
-Fourteen thousand.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.275
Fifteen thousand.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.512
Peterman is gonna kill me.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.591
I really thought
you had her there at 17,000.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.478
Why didn't you stop me?

07:25.640 --> 07:26.834
Do you hear this clunking?

07:28.840 --> 07:30.034
A little.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.992
Oh, you know what?
I'm gonna grab these from you later.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.628
You'll take care of them.
Okay? Okay.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.153
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.880
-Alrighty. Bye.
-Bye.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.110
What is going on here?

07:50.960 --> 07:53.554
Oh, my God.

08:00.040 --> 08:03.350
Oh, you idiots!

08:05.000 --> 08:06.911
So we could put the bottles
in a U-Haul.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.469
-Go lean and mean.
-Newman, it's a dead end. Come on.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.194
-Hey, there he is.
-Hey.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.590
You put your groceries under
the hood of my car?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.672
Oh, that's right.
We forgot about those.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.432
That's where my missing soda is.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.750
And your crab legs?
And a thing of cheese?

08:19.920 --> 08:23.071
The AAA guy said I was close to
sucking a muffin down the carburettor.

08:23.240 --> 08:26.437
-What were you thinking?
-We ran out of space.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.068
Now I gotta take the car to Tony
and get it checked out.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.389
-He's good.
-He's real good.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.390
But he's so obsessive
about the car.

08:32.559 --> 08:34.914
He makes me feel guilty about
everything wrong with it.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.799
I gotta get it washed before
I take it down or he'll yell at me.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.157
-Choke?
-No, thank you.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.789
Oh, yeah.

08:43.960 --> 08:48.158
I remember this car. Beautiful car.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.153
Yeah, so anyway, the engine's been
idling a little rough.

08:51.320 --> 08:54.517
I thought it might be time
for a check-up.

08:54.680 --> 08:56.432
There's nothing wrong on the inside.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.591
The shift knob is loose.
You know about that?

08:58.760 --> 09:01.399
-No, I hadn't noticed.
-Have you been picking at it?

09:02.160 --> 09:03.309
Have I been picking at it?

09:03.920 --> 09:06.115
No, you know,
it's just wear and tear.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.589
Wear and tear, I see.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.830
The engine's the only thing
that needs checking.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.070
-You been rotating the tires?
-Try to.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.673
You don't try to. You do it.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.956
Fifty-one percent of all turns
are right turns.

09:18.280 --> 09:19.793
That's right.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.228
Twenty thousand dollars?

09:23.400 --> 09:25.834
Elaine, that's twice the amount
I authorized you to spend.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.309
I know, Mr. Peterman,
but once I saw them...

09:28.480 --> 09:31.392
...I just couldn't stand to let anyone
else have them, you know.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.596
Certainly not some
stuck-up candy-bar heiress...

09:33.760 --> 09:35.876
...who flaunts herself in public
without regard--

09:36.040 --> 09:38.076
Well, where are they?

09:38.600 --> 09:40.033
They should be here today.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.351
-Mr. Wilhelm.
-Yes, George.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.316
Hi, I was just....

09:53.480 --> 09:56.278
I just had one little question
about my assignment.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.158
Well, I trust things are
moving smoothly.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.833
Mr. Steinbrenner's counting on you.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.071
Yes, yes, very smooth,
super smooth.

10:02.240 --> 10:06.279
But I really want to attack this thing.
You know, sink my teeth into it.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.396
So I was just wondering...

10:08.560 --> 10:12.553
...what do you think would be
the very best way to get started?

10:12.720 --> 10:15.188
Get started?
I don't understand, George.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.555
-I was wondering--
-You haven't been to Payroll?

10:18.440 --> 10:20.590
-No, I haven't done that.
-What's the problem?

10:20.760 --> 10:23.718
Now, come on, George. I told
the big man you were moving on this.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.552
Now, don't let him down!

10:27.760 --> 10:29.432
Payroll!

10:37.160 --> 10:41.392
Hello there.
I'm George Costanza.

10:41.560 --> 10:42.595
Yes.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.788
Assistant to the travelling secretary.

10:45.960 --> 10:49.077
I'm working on the project.

10:50.280 --> 10:54.592
-What project?
-The payroll project.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.398
Wilhelm?

10:56.560 --> 10:58.915
Big, big payroll project.

10:59.080 --> 11:02.072
You're gonna have to fill me in.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.791
You know what?
I'll look around for awhile.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.679
-I'll just browse around.
-Hey, wait. Excuse me.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.273
You can't come back here.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.671
I'm under direct orders
from Mr. Wilhelm.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.070
If you have a problem,
you just take it up with him.

11:15.720 --> 11:16.709
Well, maybe I will.

11:18.440 --> 11:21.159
You know what?
I urge you to take it up with him.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.594
Go ahead. Give him a call.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.194
He'll tell you what I'm doing here.
Then you can tell me.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.715
Mr. Wilhelm,
this is Lafarge in Payroll.

11:27.880 --> 11:32.112
There's a Costanza here,
says he's working on some project.

11:35.240 --> 11:40.473
Oh, I see. Interesting.
Well, that's quite a project.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.871
All right. Thank you.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.951
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.313
Whatever you need,
just make yourself at home.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.712
So he explained it all to you?

11:55.400 --> 11:57.709
Yes, he explained it all very clearly.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.634
-What did he tell you?
-Look, you were right, I was wrong.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.711
You don't have
to humiliate me about it.

12:05.000 --> 12:11.074

12:21.880 --> 12:23.438
Damn.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.280
Oh, Mother's Day.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.559
Wait a second.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.790
Mother's Day.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.672
Yes!

13:01.080 --> 13:03.230
Come on, Kramer!

13:03.880 --> 13:06.155
-What?
-It's the truck, Kramer, the truck.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.231
Look, Newman,
I told you to let this thing go.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.628
No, no, no, listen to me.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.189
Most days, the post office sends
one truckload of mail...

13:12.360 --> 13:15.670
...to the second domestic regional
sorting facility in Saginaw, Michigan.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.832
But on the week before holidays,
we see a surge.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.638
On Valentine's Day,
we send two trucks.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.109
On Christmas, four,
packed to the brim.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.919
And tomorrow,
if history is any guide...

13:26.080 --> 13:29.311
...we'll see some spillover
into a fifth truck.

13:29.640 --> 13:33.792
-Mother's Day.
-The mother of all mail days.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.633
And guess who's signed up
for the truck?

13:37.200 --> 13:39.031
A free truck?

13:39.200 --> 13:41.873
Oh, boy, that completely changes
our cost structure.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.996
Our G and A goes down 50 percent.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.435
We carry a couple of bags of mail,
the rest is ours!

13:46.600 --> 13:49.478
Newman, you magnificent bastard,
you did it!

13:49.640 --> 13:50.914
Let the collecting begin!

14:59.720 --> 15:02.439
So did you go down to Payroll?

15:02.600 --> 15:04.158
Yes, Payroll. Yes, I did.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.754
Very productive. Payroll paid off.

15:06.920 --> 15:09.388
Then I guess
you'll be heading downtown, huh?

15:10.480 --> 15:14.314
Oh, yeah. Downtown, definitely.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.835
I'm very interested
to see how this thing turns out.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.675
You said it. Excuse me, Mr. Wilhelm,
do you really think--?

15:20.840 --> 15:23.070
Well....

15:23.240 --> 15:28.360
Is this downtown trip really necessary,
you know, for the project?

15:28.520 --> 15:30.795
Oh, no, you've got
to go downtown, George.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.951
It's all downtown.

15:33.120 --> 15:36.112
-Just like the song says.
-The song?

15:36.600 --> 15:40.354
There's your answer, "Downtown."

15:44.760 --> 15:46.671
The song "Downtown"?
The Petula Clark song?

15:46.840 --> 15:47.875
Yeah.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.918
You're sure he didn't mention it
because you were going downtown?

15:51.080 --> 15:54.277
I think he was trying to tell me
something, like it had some meaning.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.114
Okay, so how does it go?

15:56.720 --> 16:01.157
When you're alone
And life is making you lonely

16:01.320 --> 16:03.754
You can always go

16:05.000 --> 16:06.672
Downtown

16:07.040 --> 16:10.794
Maybe you know
Some little places to go to

16:10.960 --> 16:12.791
Where they never close

16:13.800 --> 16:15.552
-Downtown
-Wait a second.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.678
Little places to go that never close.
What little place never closes?

16:19.560 --> 16:22.279
-7-Eleven.
-Maybe.

16:23.200 --> 16:28.228
Just listen to the music
Of the traffic in the city

16:28.400 --> 16:31.836
Linger on the sidewalk
Where the neon lights are pretty

16:32.000 --> 16:35.072
Where the neon lights are pretty.
The Broadway area?

16:35.240 --> 16:37.071
No, that's midtown.

16:37.240 --> 16:38.229
Midtown.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.551
The lights are much brighter there

16:42.720 --> 16:47.669
You can forget all your troubles
Forget all your cares

16:47.840 --> 16:49.068
Just go

16:49.240 --> 16:51.708
Downtown

16:51.880 --> 16:55.395
Things will be great
When you're

16:57.640 --> 16:59.278
Downtown

16:59.880 --> 17:02.440
I got nothing, Jerry, nothing.

17:02.760 --> 17:07.515
Well, don't hang around
and let your troubles surround you.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.477
There are movie shows.

17:10.359 --> 17:12.351
You think I should come clean?

17:12.520 --> 17:14.511
What do you think?
You think I should confess?

17:14.680 --> 17:16.557
How can you lose?

17:26.480 --> 17:29.392
Yeah, Jerry,
it's Tony Abado at the shop.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.357
Look, we gotta talk.
You better come down.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.636
Anytime after 4.

17:38.680 --> 17:39.999
-Hello.
-Hi, it's me.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.878
-Oh, hi.
-Listen, I need to come over...

17:42.040 --> 17:43.359
...and pick up the clubs.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.990
-Oh, you know what?
-Oh, no. What?

17:47.320 --> 17:49.436
No, it's no big deal.
I left the clubs in the car.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.795
You left them in the car?

17:51.960 --> 17:54.918
-How could you leave them in the car?
-I forgot.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.798
Oh, go down and get them.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.473
I can't.
The car's at the mechanic's.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.193
Oh, this is great.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.759
All right. Where's the mechanic?

18:01.920 --> 18:03.512
I'll just go and pick them up myself.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.910
No, no, you can't.
He's working on the car right now.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.435
You cannot disturb him
while he's working.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.834
I'm going there in an hour
if you wanna meet me there.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.672
You know the place.
It's on 56th Street.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.832
Oh, okay. All right. Fine.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.679
Hey, Tony.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.354
-Thanks for coming in, Jerry.
-Sure.

18:23.720 --> 18:28.157
I think I know what's going on here,
and I just want to hear it from you.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.276
But I want you
to be straight with me.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.112
Don't lie to me, Jerry.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.036
You know that motor oil
you're putting in there?

18:36.200 --> 18:38.111
It's from those
quickie-lube places, isn't it?

18:38.280 --> 18:42.956
-Well, I change it so often. I mean--
-Motor oil is the lifeblood of a car.

18:43.120 --> 18:46.032
You put in a low-grade oil,
you can damage vital engine parts.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.636
Okay, see this gasket?
I have no confidence in that gasket.

18:49.800 --> 18:53.190
-Tony, I really don't--
-Here's what I wanna do.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.476
I wanna overhaul the entire engine.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.200
But it's gonna take
a major commitment from you.

18:58.360 --> 19:01.033
You're gonna have to keep it under
60 miles an hour for awhile.

19:01.200 --> 19:04.875
You gotta come in, and you gotta get
the oil changed every 1000 miles.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.758
How much money is
this gonna cost me?

19:09.320 --> 19:10.912
I don't understand you.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.438
It's your own car
we're talking about.

19:13.840 --> 19:16.195
You know, you wrote
the wrong mileage down on the form.

19:16.360 --> 19:17.349
You barely know the car.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.397
Don't know the mileage,
the tire pressure.

19:19.560 --> 19:21.630
When's the last time you checked
the washer fluid?

19:21.800 --> 19:24.519
-But the washer fluid is fine.
-The washer fluid is not fine!

19:27.080 --> 19:29.310
You know what...

19:29.680 --> 19:33.195
...I just wanna take my car and
I'm gonna bring it someplace else.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.439
-What do you mean?
-Just can I have my car.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.591
I'm gonna to pay my bill
and be on my way.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.788
-Well, the car's on a lift.
-Well, just get it down.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.713
All right.

19:44.280 --> 19:48.034
Okay. Well, wait here and I'll--
I'll bring it around.

19:48.200 --> 19:50.555
Okay. Thank you very much.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.431
Hey, where's the car?

19:56.600 --> 19:58.591
-He's bringing it.
-Good.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.439
Okay. Thank you.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.794
So, what did they say?

20:13.960 --> 20:15.996
They're sending
a detective tomorrow.

20:16.160 --> 20:18.754
What the hell were you thinking
leaving my clubs in that car?

20:18.920 --> 20:22.117
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic
pulling a Mary Beth Whitehead, did l?

20:22.280 --> 20:23.872
Well, what kind of maniac
is this guy?

20:24.040 --> 20:26.031
He's a very special maniac.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.120
-What do I tell Mr. Peterman?
-I don't know.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.192
Why couldn't
you take better care of that car?

20:33.320 --> 20:36.790
-Well, are they here?
-Mr. Peterman...

20:38.200 --> 20:40.350
...there seems to be a bit of a snag.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.515
Snag?

20:42.680 --> 20:46.992
It seems that
a psychotic mechanic...

20:47.160 --> 20:50.516
...has absconded
with my friend's car.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.352
What does that have
to do with my clubs?

20:52.520 --> 20:54.715
They happened to be
in the back seat at the time.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.674
What was the suspect wearing
at the time of the incident?

21:01.840 --> 21:06.436
You know, like mechanic's pants,
a shirt that said "Tony."

21:06.600 --> 21:08.989
Let me ask you,
have you ever seen a case like this?

21:09.160 --> 21:12.197
All the time. The mechanic forms
an emotional attachment...

21:12.360 --> 21:15.909
...thinks he's gonna lose the car.
He panics and does something rash.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.112
I'm gonna ask you
some personal questions.

21:18.280 --> 21:21.317
I'm sorry if I touch a nerve,
but I think it will help with the case.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.400
Had you been
taking good care of the car?

21:24.560 --> 21:26.596
-Had I been taking--?
-Did you leave the AC on?

21:26.760 --> 21:30.230
Do you zip over speed bumps?
Ride the clutch? Things like that?

21:30.400 --> 21:34.109
What does it matter? It's my car.
I can do whatever I want with it.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.798
Not that I would think
of doing such things.

21:37.960 --> 21:41.669
All right, Mr. Seinfeld,
we'll let you know if we find anything.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.558
I gotta be honest with you.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.312
These cases never end up well.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.640
Well, whatever you can do.
Thanks.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.315
Mr. Wilhelm, about the project, sir.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.959
That's what I came to talk about.

21:57.120 --> 22:00.192
Great job, George.
You really nailed it.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.436
-I did?
-Yes, I read through it this morning.

22:03.600 --> 22:07.388
I couldn't have done it better myself.
I turned it over to Mr. Steinbrenner.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.993
Good work, George.

22:12.000 --> 22:12.989
I don't get it.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.720
He assigns it to you,
you don't do it...

22:15.880 --> 22:17.154
...somehow it gets done...

22:17.320 --> 22:19.595
...and now he's telling you
what a great job you did.

22:19.760 --> 22:22.274
Maybe somebody did it
and didn't take credit for it.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.477
Maybe it was already done and
didn't need doing in the first place.

22:25.800 --> 22:28.360
I have no idea who did it...

22:28.520 --> 22:30.909
...what they did,
or how they did it so well.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.274
And you know what?

22:32.440 --> 22:35.352
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.

22:36.440 --> 22:39.716
The gardener did a nice job planting
the rose bushes, didn't he, dear?

22:39.880 --> 22:42.758
You planted the rose bushes, dear.

22:44.120 --> 22:47.590
-I did?
-Yesterday. You remember.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.432
That's right.

22:50.840 --> 22:53.354
-Oh, what's for dinner?
-We just ate.

22:53.520 --> 22:56.432
Did you forget
to take your medicine?

22:59.680 --> 23:02.240
The point is,
however it got done, it's done.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.630
So any luck with the car?

23:04.800 --> 23:06.028
No, the police have no leads.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.634
And I just found out today
my insurance doesn't cover it.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.597
-Why not?
-They don't consider it stolen...

23:10.760 --> 23:12.830
...if you wilfully
give the guy the keys.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.319
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:15.480 --> 23:16.674
What did the detective say?

23:17.880 --> 23:19.472
They're looking.

23:19.800 --> 23:20.994
I gotta go.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.479
-Hello.
-Mr. Seinfeld?

23:24.640 --> 23:26.437
-Yeah.
-It's Detective McMahon.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.478
I'm at the warehouse on pier 38.

23:30.440 --> 23:32.078
I think you'd better get down here.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.276
Yeah, okay.
They may have found the car.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.119
Are the clubs in it? Ask him.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.872
Are there golf clubs in the back?

23:38.040 --> 23:40.190
We really can't tell.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.193
You better bring
your service records.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.513
Watch where you step.

23:48.680 --> 23:52.195
There's quite a bit of grease.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.952
Detective, Jerry Seinfeld is here.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.512
How do you do?
Thanks for coming down.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.318
This is Elaine Benes.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.516
We used to date
but now we're just friends.

24:00.680 --> 24:02.352
-I see.
-You know.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.759
I'm sorry to make you go through this,
but we need to make sure.

24:05.920 --> 24:07.512
What's going on?
What is this thing?

24:07.680 --> 24:10.717
One of our patrolmen
stumbled over this.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.029
Oh, my God.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.596
The block is nearly split apart.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.433
We found the overhead cams
30 feet away.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.636
We can only hope
the body's sold for scrap.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.393
Oh, my God.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.039
And we know it's a Saab.

24:23.200 --> 24:26.556
The angle on the V6
is definitely a '92.

24:26.720 --> 24:30.679
The model is hard to determine
because the drive train is all burnt out.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.791
What is that smell?

24:32.960 --> 24:34.598
Look at the clutch.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.352
Excuse me.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.833
Whoever did this
didn't just dismantle it.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.434
I mean, they took their time,
they had fun...

24:42.600 --> 24:44.192
...they were very systematic.

24:44.360 --> 24:46.920
They went out of the way
to gouge the sides of every piston.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.469
And the turbo was separated
from the housing...

24:49.640 --> 24:52.359
...and shoved right up
the exhaust pipe.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.678
Wait a second. Turbo?

24:54.840 --> 24:57.400
-I didn't have a turbo.
-Your car is not a turbo?

24:57.560 --> 24:59.710
No, it's a 900 S.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.235
It's a turbo, Elaine. A turbo.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.879
It's a turbo!

25:06.280 --> 25:07.793
Excuse me.
Did you say "Turbo"?

25:09.560 --> 25:11.869
Saab Turbo 9000?

25:12.200 --> 25:14.555
Is it midnight blue?

25:15.280 --> 25:16.872
Yes, ma'am.

25:18.880 --> 25:22.429
9999 bottles and cans in the truck

25:22.600 --> 25:25.478
9999 bottles and cans

25:25.640 --> 25:30.316
At $0. 10 a bottle and $0. 10 a can
We're pulling in $500 a man

25:30.480 --> 25:33.711
9998 bottles and cans in the truck

25:33.880 --> 25:36.838
9998 bottles and cans

25:37.000 --> 25:39.434
We fill up with gas
We count up our cash

25:39.600 --> 25:44.151
9997 bottles and cans in the truck

25:50.000 --> 25:52.833
-Hello.
-Hey, Jerry. It's Tony.

25:53.280 --> 25:54.429
Tony, where are you?

25:54.600 --> 25:57.160
Oh, look, I just want you to know
that the car is fine.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.514
Got her all fixed up.

25:58.680 --> 26:01.717
We're in a nice area,
no potholes, no traffic.

26:01.880 --> 26:03.871
So there's nothing
to worry about, okay?

26:04.040 --> 26:05.359
In fact, here.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.715
Somebody wants to talk to you.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.994
Tony, you better
bring that car back.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.673
Nobody's giving anything back.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.114
You tried to take it from me.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.474
I don't forget that.

26:17.640 --> 26:20.108
Tony, it is my car,
and I want it back.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.555
Oh, your car?
You want your car back?

26:22.760 --> 26:24.193
-Tony--
-Listen.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.590
That registration may have
your name on it, Jerry...

26:26.760 --> 26:30.594
...but this engine's running
on my sweat and my blood.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.715
Where do I find these guys?

26:40.680 --> 26:44.514
-How much gas we got?
-Three quarters of a tank.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.234
Better than we estimated.

26:47.880 --> 26:52.670
-Seven dollars and 22 cents better.
-Oh, baby.

26:52.840 --> 26:56.549
-Maybe we could stop for a snack.
-No, that's not in the budget.

26:56.920 --> 27:00.469
Well, the budget changed, you know.
I mean, it might be a good investment.

27:00.640 --> 27:03.154
That's not a good investment.
That's a loss.

27:05.080 --> 27:06.513
Hey, you see that car?

27:07.240 --> 27:09.196
It looks like Jerry's.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.396
I'm gonna check out
that license plate.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.232
Yeah, those are New York plates.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.231
-ls that Jerry's number?
-I don't know.

27:17.400 --> 27:21.154
But that's New York and we're in Ohio.
Those are pretty good odds.

27:21.320 --> 27:22.833
-What are you doing?
-Calling Jerry.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.117
-On what?
-I brought my phone.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.068
-Hello.
-Hey, Jerry.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.310
-What's your license plate number?
-What's up?

27:33.480 --> 27:35.118
Yeah, well,
I think I spotted your car.

27:35.280 --> 27:38.272
Oh, my God, you're kidding.
Hang on a second.

27:38.920 --> 27:42.276
-It's JVN728.
-Hey, that's it.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.510
That's it.
Hey, look, we got him.

27:44.680 --> 27:46.238
We're driving behind him
in a truck.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.914
Oh, my God. Yeah.
He said he brought it to the country.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.196
We're in the country,
and we're right on his tail.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.112
Good work, Kramer.
This is incredible.

27:53.280 --> 27:54.429
Yeah, don't worry, Jerry.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.353
We're right on this guy
like stink on a monkey.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.351
I'll check back with you.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.114
Elaine Benes.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.998
Yeah, it's me.
Kramer found the car.

28:04.480 --> 28:05.754
Oh, my God. Where is it?

28:05.920 --> 28:07.876
Somewhere in the country.
They're following him.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.515
-The clubs there?
-I don't know. They're tailing him.

28:10.680 --> 28:14.036
-I'm waiting for them to call me back.
-All right. I'm heading over right now.

28:17.720 --> 28:20.188
-What's the status?
-Last check-in, they were still on him.

28:20.600 --> 28:21.953
Have they called the police yet?

28:22.120 --> 28:24.156
-They won't call the police.
-What? Why not?

28:24.320 --> 28:26.117
They'll get in trouble
for using the truck.

28:26.280 --> 28:28.350
-Kramer doesn't want a record.
-Kramer has one.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.873
Not a federal record.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.269
-Kramer?
-Kramer?

28:34.440 --> 28:35.793
-What's going on?
-Yeah, nothing.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.154
We're still following him.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.830
Wait a second. He's getting off.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.309
Yeah, he's gonna be going south
on the 135.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.914
-Keep following him.
-All right. I'll follow him.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.718
We can't.
We're going north to Michigan.

28:48.120 --> 28:51.317
Yeah, hey, listen, I can't.
It's gonna be taking us out of our way.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.114
-I need those clubs.
-Kramer, I want my car.

28:54.280 --> 28:57.192
-Well, I don't know what to do!
-We got 10,000 deposit bottles here.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.998
This guy could be going
to Arkansas.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.679
Keep following.
Don't let me down.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.718
We can't afford a detour.
Our budget won't hold it.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.279
I don't know what to do, man!

29:05.440 --> 29:07.874
Stay left! Stay left!
Left, left, left. Stay left!

29:08.040 --> 29:09.393
-Right! Go right!
-Go south!

29:09.560 --> 29:12.393
All right, all right. I'm getting off.
I'm gonna go on the ramp.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.232
I hope you realize
what you've done.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.277
You've destroyed
our whole venture.

29:16.440 --> 29:17.953
This ramp is steep.

29:18.120 --> 29:21.317
All my work, my planning, my genius,
all for naught.

29:21.480 --> 29:22.833
We're pulling too much weight.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.594
-He's getting away. Take the wheel.
-Hey, what are you doing?

29:25.760 --> 29:28.399
-I'm gonna get something.
-Are you crazy?

29:29.320 --> 29:30.992
Keep your foot on the gas.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.639
Hey, you're not dumping those
bottles back there, are you?

29:38.440 --> 29:42.752
Kramer, those have wholesale value.
We can cut our losses.

29:42.920 --> 29:45.354
Bottles below!

29:53.320 --> 29:56.118
I love this magnifying glass.
I feel like a scientist.

29:56.280 --> 29:58.555
-Oh, yeah.
-You wanted to see me, sir?

29:59.120 --> 30:01.111
Come in, George. Come in.

30:01.280 --> 30:04.556
Wilhelm gave me
this project you worked on.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.358
-Yes, sir.
-Let me ask you something.

30:06.520 --> 30:09.318
Having any personal problems?
Girl trouble? Love trouble?

30:10.240 --> 30:11.832
-No, sir.
-What about drugs?

30:12.000 --> 30:14.116
Doing some of that crack cocaine?
You on the pipe?

30:15.240 --> 30:17.231
-No, sir.
-Are you seeing a psychiatrist?

30:17.400 --> 30:20.039
I got a flash for you, young man.
You're non compos mentis.

30:20.200 --> 30:21.918
You got some bats in the belfry.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.388
What are you talking about?

30:24.600 --> 30:27.398
George, I read this report.
It's troubling. Very troubling indeed.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.949
It's a sick mind at work here.
Okay, come on, boys.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.917
Come in here.
George, this is Herb and Dan.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.389
They're gonna take you
to where you can get some help.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.994
Very friendly people there.
My brother-in-law was there.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.752
Man was obsessed
with lactating women.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.990
They cured him.
Although he eats a lot of cheese.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.072
But you see-- You see, I didn't
write that report. That's not mine.

30:45.240 --> 30:47.071
Of course you didn't.
You didn't write it.

30:47.240 --> 30:49.515
I didn't do it! It just got done!

30:49.680 --> 30:52.035
I don't know how it got done
but it did!

30:52.200 --> 30:53.315
Of course, it got done.

30:53.480 --> 30:55.596
Things get done all the time.
I understand.

30:55.760 --> 30:58.115
Your job will be waiting for you
when you get back.

30:58.280 --> 31:01.238
Get better, George!
Get better!

31:06.320 --> 31:08.151
Man, I don't understand this.

31:08.320 --> 31:11.073
I ditched every bottle and can,
and we still can't gain.

31:11.240 --> 31:12.832
It's like we're...

31:13.800 --> 31:15.392
...sluggish.

31:15.560 --> 31:19.269
We collected all those bottles and
all those cans for what? What a waste.

31:19.440 --> 31:22.034
I'm really gonna catch hell
for those missing mailbags.

31:22.400 --> 31:25.392
Hey, wasn't that a pie stand
back there?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.399
-A pie stand?
-Oh, yeah.

31:27.560 --> 31:29.391
Homemade pies, 200 yards back.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.676
Oh, come on, pull over.
Pull over, will you?

31:36.760 --> 31:37.954
Where? I don't see it.

31:38.120 --> 31:40.998
Well, open the door.
You'll get a better look.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.832
I don't see any pie.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.234
Kramer!

31:46.400 --> 31:49.631
I'm sorry, Newman,
you were holding us back.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.358
Kramer!

31:54.280 --> 31:57.716
Jerry, we've lost the fat man
and we're running lean.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.871
We're back on track, buddy.

32:01.960 --> 32:03.871
Federal employee.

32:19.280 --> 32:20.952
I hate corn.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.599
-Hello, stranger.
-Look, I'm sorry to bother you...

33:01.760 --> 33:03.239
...but I'm a U.S. postal worker...

33:03.400 --> 33:05.311
...and my mail truck
was just ambushed...

33:05.480 --> 33:08.358
...by a band of backwoods,
mail-hating survivalists.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.033
You just calm down now.
Calm down.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.872
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

33:12.040 --> 33:15.237
This farm ain't much,
but you're welcome to what we have.

33:15.400 --> 33:19.791
-Hot bath, hearty meal, clean bed.
-Oh, thank you, sir.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.439
I just have one rule.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.795
Keep your hands off my daughter.

33:30.480 --> 33:33.119
Jerry, we got him.
I'm riding his tail.

33:33.280 --> 33:35.874
There's no escape.
He's running scared, buddy.

33:36.040 --> 33:38.918
-How's the gas situation?
-I got enough to get to Memphis.

33:39.640 --> 33:40.959
He's reaching in back.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.873
Keeps grabbing at something.
He's pulling out a gun.

33:44.040 --> 33:46.235
-He's got a gun, Jerry!
-Duck, Kramer, duck.

33:49.440 --> 33:51.431
It's a golf club. There's no gun.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.716
He threw a golf club at me!

33:53.880 --> 33:55.632
Those are JFK's golf clubs.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.028
Hey, I'm under fire.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.236
I'm under heavy fire here.

34:05.360 --> 34:07.191
Jeez, there goes a five-iron.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.152
Stop the truck, Kramer.
Pick up the clubs.

34:09.320 --> 34:12.039
No, don't stop, Kramer.
Keep going. Don't let him get away.

34:12.280 --> 34:14.475
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I think he's done.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.437
Oh, no, he's taking out the woods!

34:23.239 --> 34:25.389
You'll have to do
a lot better than that!

34:31.080 --> 34:32.831
What's happening?

34:33.159 --> 34:36.038
This truck is dying.
We're losing him.

34:49.120 --> 34:52.032
-I think we lost him.
-Damn it.

34:52.199 --> 34:54.110
Can you stop
and pick up those clubs, Kramer?

34:54.440 --> 34:56.556
Yeah, yeah, I'll get them.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.157
Enjoying that mutton?

35:38.760 --> 35:39.954
It's delicious mutton.

35:40.120 --> 35:42.839
This is-- This is out of sight.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.039
I would-- I would love to get the recipe.
It's very good.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.079
That cider too strong for you?

36:02.240 --> 36:05.437
No, no, I love strong cider.

36:05.600 --> 36:09.479
I'm a big strong-cider guy.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.473
Gonna milk the Holsteins
in the morning, if you'd lend a hand.

36:14.600 --> 36:17.319
You know, I don't know much about--
I don't have any--

36:17.480 --> 36:20.040
-I don't think I know much about that.
-Susie will teach you.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.711
Just gotta pull on the teets a little.

36:25.480 --> 36:29.598
It's nice having
a big, strong man around.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.555
You know, those mailbags,
they get mighty heavy.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.354
I....

36:36.520 --> 36:38.590
I Nautilus, of course.

36:43.080 --> 36:44.877
Can I have some gravy?

36:48.960 --> 36:51.713
Steinbrenner had me committed!
I'm in the nuthouse.

36:51.880 --> 36:53.791
I'll be back
same time next week, Pop.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.598
They took my belt, Jerry.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.239
I got nothing to hold my pants up.

36:58.120 --> 37:00.031
You gotta come over here now!

37:00.200 --> 37:03.158
Just tell him what we talked about,
how I didn't do the project.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.833
George?

37:06.280 --> 37:08.032
I see you're finally
getting some help.

37:08.200 --> 37:12.193
Oh, Deena, thank God.
Thank God, you're here.

37:12.360 --> 37:13.634
Listen, you gotta help me.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.677
You gotta tell these people
that I'm okay.

37:15.840 --> 37:18.115
You know
that I don't belong in here.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.632
George, this is
the best thing for you.

37:23.680 --> 37:26.831
What? No, no, Deena.
Deena, wait! Deena, help!

37:27.000 --> 37:28.194
It's not what it looks like.

37:28.360 --> 37:30.316
Is that little Georgie C?

37:31.160 --> 37:32.752
How's the folks?

37:32.920 --> 37:35.229
You still got that nice little car?

37:57.800 --> 38:00.030
-What are you doing?
-Kramer, help me, help me!

38:02.200 --> 38:04.111
I told you to keep away
from my daughter.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.072
No, Daddy, you'll hurt him.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.912
I love him.

38:11.080 --> 38:15.392
Goodbye, Norman! Goodbye!

38:23.360 --> 38:25.828
Elaine, you found the clubs.
That's wonderful news.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.116
-Where are they?
-Yep.

38:28.520 --> 38:30.272
Let me get them for you,
Mr. Peterman.

38:30.440 --> 38:33.796
I'll be inaugurating them this weekend
with none other than Ethel Kennedy.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.671
A woman whose triumph
in the face of tragedy...

38:36.840 --> 38:40.196
...is exceeded only
by her proclivity to procreate.

38:53.440 --> 38:54.759
The....

38:55.320 --> 38:59.359
The letter of authenticity
is in the side pocket there.

38:59.520 --> 39:00.953
Elaine.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.790
I never knew Kennedy
had such a temper.

39:09.160 --> 39:10.752
Oh, yeah.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.273
The only thing worse was his slice.

39:17.120 --> 39:20.430
-See you on Monday.
-Have a good game.
