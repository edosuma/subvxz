WEBVTT

00:04.538 --> 00:05.906
Good show tonight, mr. Jordan.

00:06.473 --> 00:08.141
Hey, kenneth,
why aren't your teeth glowing

00:08.208 --> 00:09.576
In the black light?

00:09.643 --> 00:11.544
You'll have to ask the fella
who whittled 'em for me.

00:16.784 --> 00:17.951
It's her, isn't it?

00:18.018 --> 00:19.252
I don't kiss and tell, jack.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.087
Ahh, because you're a gentleman, danny.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.656
It's good to finally have
another one of us around here.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.258
I'm just happy to be here.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.427
A month ago I was doing a
robot act on the street,

00:27.494 --> 00:28.695
So I know my place.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.530
<i>I want to be tgs' steve nash.</i>

00:30.598 --> 00:32.497
Come down from canada, work hard,

00:32.566 --> 00:34.701
Make the black guy look good.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.235
Did you just make a sports reference?

00:36.303 --> 00:37.800
You know how little of that I get here?

00:38.518 --> 00:39.722
Look at me in the black light.

00:39.790 --> 00:40.990
<i>It's tron.</i>

00:41.058 --> 00:42.759
Watch out, sark. It's me, flynn.

00:42.826 --> 00:44.060
[imitates light cycle]

00:44.128 --> 00:45.828
[chuckles] light bike.

00:45.896 --> 00:47.363
Good job tonight, danny.

00:47.431 --> 00:48.998
Robot lorenzo lamas was funny.

00:49.066 --> 00:51.901
As was robot ryan seacrest
and david hasselbot.

00:51.969 --> 00:52.936
Hey, it's the writing.

00:53.003 --> 00:54.037
It's really not.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.441
So now that danny's here,

00:58.509 --> 01:00.176
You actually come to the after-parties?

01:00.244 --> 01:02.645
It's nice to have another
man around for once.

01:02.713 --> 01:04.447
Oh, there are other men--

01:07.217 --> 01:08.184
Oh, boy.

01:08.252 --> 01:10.219
It's not what you think!

01:10.287 --> 01:13.356
It's something I need to
wear to support my breasts!

01:13.424 --> 01:15.258
Lemon, I have season
tickets to every sports team

01:15.326 --> 01:16.392
In new york.

01:16.460 --> 01:17.760
So close to the action, you'll feel

01:17.828 --> 01:19.596
Like you're sitting in
front of an hd television

01:19.663 --> 01:22.999
And they're wasted on
you and your co-workers.

01:23.067 --> 01:24.634
Why won't they put me on the jumbotron?

01:24.702 --> 01:28.037
I've been doing cool stuff all game.

01:28.105 --> 01:29.205
Whoo!

01:29.273 --> 01:31.107
But my biggest problem with quiddich is,

01:31.175 --> 01:33.309
If the snitch is 150 points,

01:33.377 --> 01:35.278
Why does anyone bother with the quaffle?

01:35.346 --> 01:38.281
[cheering]

01:38.349 --> 01:40.683
Hey, jeter! Are you jealous?

01:40.751 --> 01:43.920
I'm with my new boyfriend!

01:43.988 --> 01:45.455
But now that danny's here,

01:45.522 --> 01:47.454
I have someone to do guy stuff with.

01:47.522 --> 01:49.790
Have actual male conversations.

01:49.858 --> 01:51.625
You know, he confided in me
he's got a little something

01:51.693 --> 01:53.093
Going with one of the girls here.

01:53.161 --> 01:55.863
Maybe it's that russian
dancer with the tattoos,

01:55.931 --> 01:58.632
Which is the crazy sex trifecta.

01:58.700 --> 01:59.967
That girl has a name, jack.

02:00.035 --> 02:01.902
We call her "skankovitch."

02:01.970 --> 02:03.470
I'm sure you disapprove.

02:03.538 --> 02:04.939
But the workplace has a hierarchy,

02:05.006 --> 02:06.440
And danny is a star.

02:06.508 --> 02:08.741
All the pretty little things down here

02:08.810 --> 02:10.877
Always want to be with the people up here.

02:10.946 --> 02:11.946
Whatever.

02:12.013 --> 02:13.147
As long as he's discreet about it.

02:13.214 --> 02:14.915
It's a younger man's game, lemon.

02:14.983 --> 02:16.417
But I can't say that I don't miss it.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.052
You'd be in your office late at night.

02:18.119 --> 02:20.487
The new girl would come
in with some flimsy excuse

02:20.555 --> 02:21.555
To be there.

02:21.623 --> 02:22.923
[imitating woman] "oh, mr. Donaghy.

02:22.991 --> 02:25.626
I forgot to give you the
factory worker death rates."

02:25.694 --> 02:27.528
Then she'd laugh at your lame joke.

02:27.596 --> 02:29.363
A touch on the arm...

02:29.431 --> 02:31.065
[inhales deeply]

02:31.132 --> 02:34.501
And you take your reward.

02:34.569 --> 02:35.970
[inhales sharply]

02:36.037 --> 02:37.771
You take your reward.

02:37.839 --> 02:39.239
How drunk are you?

02:39.307 --> 02:41.175
A lot to very.

02:41.242 --> 02:44.445
Boy, that robot body
paint does not wash off.

02:44.512 --> 02:47.014
Is it the body paint
or is danny just glowing

02:47.082 --> 02:49.316
Like a beacon of manly camaraderie?

02:49.384 --> 02:51.085
Oh, god.

02:51.152 --> 02:52.586
I'm extremely drunk.

02:52.654 --> 02:55.255
Oh, my.

03:16.333 --> 03:17.433
Hey.

03:17.501 --> 03:18.868
We got to get danny out by 5:00 today.

03:18.936 --> 03:20.770
I guess jack's taking
him to the knicks game.

03:20.837 --> 03:23.205
Liz, I can't do girls' lunch today.

03:23.273 --> 03:24.640
We've never done that.

03:24.708 --> 03:26.242
i>- Because I have an audition
for gossip girl.

03:26.310 --> 03:27.343
Oh, I love that show.

03:27.411 --> 03:28.778
I play tartine gramercy,

03:28.845 --> 03:30.746
An heiress to a vermouth fortune

03:30.814 --> 03:32.015
And a freshman at nyu.

03:32.082 --> 03:34.017
Really? A college freshman?

03:34.084 --> 03:35.552
That's right. In this scene they gave me,

03:35.619 --> 03:36.853
I'm fighting with my mother,

03:36.921 --> 03:39.189
A washed-up actress who's clinging

03:39.256 --> 03:40.990
To her last scraps of faded glamour.

03:41.058 --> 03:41.825
- Uh
-huh.

03:41.893 --> 03:43.460
It's interesting that they
highlighted the mother's lines.

03:43.528 --> 03:45.329
Well, that's so I'll
know what part not to read.

03:45.396 --> 03:48.031
As if the word "mother"
didn't tip me off already.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.834
Wish me luck.

03:51.902 --> 03:52.769
We really should have said something.

03:52.786 --> 03:53.820
What happens when she gets there

03:53.887 --> 03:55.455
And finds out she's the mom?

03:55.522 --> 03:56.723
Oh, pete, that's later.

03:56.790 --> 03:57.957
Maybe we'll be dead by then.

03:58.025 --> 04:00.560
Oh, that'd be great.

04:00.628 --> 04:02.528
Sue, you're probably
wondering why we asked you

04:02.596 --> 04:04.564
To join the entourage.

04:04.632 --> 04:07.600
Well, over the years,
I've had a complicated relationship

04:07.668 --> 04:10.370
With women, from my treatment
of the dancers here

04:10.437 --> 04:12.538
To my remarks about madeleine albright

04:12.606 --> 04:15.708
At the 1996 white house
correspondents' dinner.

04:15.776 --> 04:17.577
What? It's true.

04:17.644 --> 04:20.413
She does look like one of those.

04:20.481 --> 04:22.415
Now that mr. Jordan's having a daughter,

04:22.483 --> 04:23.839
He wants to learn to give all women

04:23.907 --> 04:25.675
The respect they deserve.

04:25.742 --> 04:27.410
Even you foreigners.

04:27.477 --> 04:28.611
That's why I'm adding a daughter

04:28.679 --> 04:29.812
To the entourage family.

04:30.380 --> 04:33.182
Now what's on the schedule for today?

04:33.249 --> 04:34.717
"10:00 a.M. Dotcom shows up pictures

04:34.784 --> 04:36.018
From his trip to greece."

04:36.086 --> 04:38.620
I think I'm gonna go
ahead and cancel that.

04:38.688 --> 04:42.191
Okay, I'll reschedule... Again.

04:42.258 --> 04:44.560
"11:00 a.M. Go to strip club."

04:44.627 --> 04:45.694
I'll get the car.

04:45.762 --> 04:47.296
Hang on! No.

04:47.363 --> 04:49.531
I don't think we should go to a strip club.

04:49.599 --> 04:50.966
It just doesn't feel right.

04:51.034 --> 04:52.601
I think we should let the new member

04:52.669 --> 04:53.969
Choose an activity.

04:54.037 --> 04:55.871
- I like to go to tasti d-lite.

04:55.939 --> 04:57.606
I said we're not going to a strip club.

04:57.674 --> 04:58.607
Pinkberry?

04:58.675 --> 04:59.742
What don't you understand?

04:59.809 --> 05:01.510
I don't want to take you to a strip club.

05:04.614 --> 05:06.415
Oh, come on, you hoser!

05:06.483 --> 05:09.518
Hoser!

05:09.586 --> 05:11.620
So what did you do after
the party the other night?

05:11.688 --> 05:14.857
Well, my work friend
and I went to her office.

05:14.924 --> 05:16.125
Ooh, she has an office.

05:16.192 --> 05:17.392
Hey, is it that chick lawyer who does

05:17.460 --> 05:18.827
The sexual harassment presentation?

05:18.895 --> 05:20.329
Because she's asking for it.

05:20.396 --> 05:22.164
Okay, no more guesses. Continue.

05:22.232 --> 05:23.565
All right, so we're getting into it,

05:23.633 --> 05:24.967
And she takes off her glasses.

05:25.034 --> 05:27.903
Real sexy. - Nice.

05:27.971 --> 05:29.404
But she never takes off her shoes,

05:29.472 --> 05:30.572
Which I kind of like.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.307
Even though the reason is

05:32.375 --> 05:33.709
She's never let a man see her feet.

05:33.777 --> 05:36.078
What?

05:36.146 --> 05:37.246
And she's kind of a tease.

05:37.313 --> 05:39.381
Mostly we just kiss and then she makes me

05:39.449 --> 05:41.016
Go down to the deli to get her a sandwich.

05:41.084 --> 05:43.041
So we haven't gone too far,
but under that dress,

05:43.109 --> 05:46.611
I can tell she's wearing
some weird underwear.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.046
I want to see it.

05:48.114 --> 05:51.349
They're called spanx.

05:55.357 --> 05:56.291
- Hello.
- Jenna, thanks so much

05:56.358 --> 05:57.358
For coming in.

05:57.426 --> 05:58.460
This is archeria.

05:58.527 --> 06:00.328
She'll be reading with you. - Hi.

06:00.396 --> 06:02.263
Okay, tartine has just discovered

06:02.331 --> 06:05.567
Videos of her boyfriend on her
mother's online sex diary.

06:05.634 --> 06:08.103
Both: "mother, is there
something I don't know

06:08.170 --> 06:09.370
About you and wainwright?"

06:09.438 --> 06:10.371
[laughter]

06:10.439 --> 06:11.773
What are you doing?

06:11.841 --> 06:13.041
Sorry. Let's start over.

06:13.109 --> 06:15.276
Both: "mother, is there something I don't--

06:15.344 --> 06:18.747
Jenna, you're reading the wrong lines.

06:18.814 --> 06:21.015
What do you mean?

06:21.083 --> 06:22.784
I'm not playing the mo--

06:22.852 --> 06:24.753
[laughter]

06:24.820 --> 06:28.289
[maniacal laughter]

06:28.357 --> 06:30.291
[screams]

06:31.059 --> 06:32.493
You wanted to see me?

06:32.561 --> 06:37.097
Close the door, lemon.

06:37.165 --> 06:40.868
So we haven't talked about
your personal life lately.

06:40.936 --> 06:42.937
Anything new going on there?

06:43.004 --> 06:44.605
No. Same old nothing.

06:44.673 --> 06:46.474
Nothing? Really?

06:46.541 --> 06:48.342
That's too bad.

06:48.410 --> 06:50.411
'cause you know what I always say,

06:50.479 --> 06:51.946
Black light attack!

06:52.013 --> 06:53.514
What?

06:53.582 --> 06:54.748
Oh, boy.

06:54.816 --> 06:57.084
That stuff does not wash off.

06:57.152 --> 06:58.219
You and danny?

06:58.286 --> 06:59.620
I would have guessed anyone else.

06:59.688 --> 07:00.677
Jenna, sue--

07:00.745 --> 07:03.180
All right, come on.

07:03.248 --> 07:04.515
How is this possible?

07:04.582 --> 07:06.049
Well, I don't know if you know this, jack,

07:06.117 --> 07:07.785
But the workplace is a hierarchy,

07:07.852 --> 07:09.353
And I am danny's boss.

07:09.421 --> 07:10.821
Sometimes all the... [imitating jack]

07:10.889 --> 07:12.723
Pretty little things down here want to be

07:12.791 --> 07:14.391
With the people up here.

07:14.459 --> 07:16.660
And they come into your
office late one night

07:16.728 --> 07:18.362
With some flimsy excuse.

07:18.430 --> 07:20.464
[knocks on door] hey, liz.

07:20.532 --> 07:22.299
I just want to show you this new iphone app.

07:22.367 --> 07:25.502
You shake it and it
sounds like an empty can.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.737
Huh? - [chuckles]

07:26.805 --> 07:28.405
My favorite apps are the
ones before my entree.

07:28.473 --> 07:29.973
[hearty laugh]

07:30.041 --> 07:31.842
Oh, my god.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.744
That is the funniest thing I've ever heard.

07:33.812 --> 07:35.979
So what are you up to right now?

07:36.047 --> 07:38.148
And I took my reward.

07:38.216 --> 07:39.550
Lemon, you need to end this now.

07:39.617 --> 07:40.684
What? No.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.052
Jack, you were just talking about

07:42.120 --> 07:43.520
How you miss office hook-ups.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.588
That is a double standard.

07:44.656 --> 07:46.156
- Calm down.
- I won't calm down.

07:46.224 --> 07:47.357
Women are allowed to get angrier than men

07:47.425 --> 07:48.659
About double standards.

07:48.726 --> 07:50.027
It's not about that.

07:50.094 --> 07:52.095
Yes, I've had office
relationships in the past,

07:52.163 --> 07:54.364
But always with people that I could transfer

07:54.432 --> 07:56.633
To another city or introduce
to nicolas sarkozy.

07:56.701 --> 07:58.268
Danny is on your show.

07:58.336 --> 07:59.670
Yeah, but it's not serious.

07:59.737 --> 08:00.804
It's not serious yet.

08:00.872 --> 08:03.173
End it before it starts affecting the show.

08:03.241 --> 08:04.908
[sighs] fine.

08:04.976 --> 08:07.511
I'll talk to him when he gets in.

08:07.579 --> 08:10.681
What did he do to the back of your knees?

08:10.748 --> 08:15.185
A lady never tells.

08:16.253 --> 08:18.544
Hey, buddy, you like italian ice?

08:19.112 --> 08:20.379
Hey, watch your mouth!

08:20.447 --> 08:23.215
She's only 34 years old!

08:23.283 --> 08:24.483
K?

08:24.551 --> 08:25.951
What's wrong with me?

08:26.019 --> 08:27.820
First, I don't want to go to strip clubs,

08:27.888 --> 08:29.955
And then I get angry at the hilarious dude

08:30.023 --> 08:31.390
That says something awesome.

08:31.458 --> 08:33.058
There's nothing wrong with you, sir.

08:33.126 --> 08:35.794
It's just you're treating
sue like family now.

08:35.861 --> 08:37.830
That makes you feel protective of her.

08:37.898 --> 08:39.398
But I'm not like that with my sons.

08:39.466 --> 08:40.933
When they were little, I threw them

08:41.001 --> 08:42.934
In the deep end of our pool to help them

08:43.003 --> 08:44.670
Get over their fear of sharks.

08:44.738 --> 08:46.739
Well, it's different with girls.

08:46.807 --> 08:48.607
You want to protect them from the world.

08:48.675 --> 08:50.176
I'm proud of you, sir.

08:50.243 --> 08:52.945
It's like a whole new part
of your heart has opened up.

08:53.013 --> 08:55.281
Thank god, 'cause the
doctors keep telling me

08:55.348 --> 08:56.949
It's pretty clogged.

08:58.985 --> 09:00.820
The mother.

09:00.887 --> 09:03.155
They wanted me to play the...Mother.

09:03.223 --> 09:05.424
Oh, boy. Okay, here we go.

09:05.492 --> 09:07.359
Pete! Jenna just got the--

09:07.427 --> 09:08.594
[scoffs]

09:08.662 --> 09:09.695
A mother?

09:09.763 --> 09:11.063
I'm not a mother.

09:11.131 --> 09:12.798
Would a mother be planning a sex tour

09:12.866 --> 09:14.133
Of vietnam this spring?

09:14.201 --> 09:16.202
Just--just come on.

09:16.269 --> 09:17.803
Look, you're a beautiful woman,

09:17.871 --> 09:21.674
But you can't play prom queens
and murdered runaways forever.

09:21.741 --> 09:23.542
But those were my majors
at the royal tampa academy

09:23.610 --> 09:25.010
Of dramatic tricks.

09:25.078 --> 09:27.146
You can try to fight getting older.

09:27.214 --> 09:29.482
You can be like madonna and cling to youth

09:29.549 --> 09:31.884
With your gollum arms or you can be

09:31.952 --> 09:35.287
Like meryl streep and embrace
your age with elegance.

09:35.355 --> 09:36.712
So you're saying it's a choice

09:36.780 --> 09:39.047
Between the dignity of middle age

09:39.115 --> 09:40.616
And the illusion of youth.

09:40.683 --> 09:41.917
Two paths.

09:41.985 --> 09:43.952
Meryl streep or madonna.

09:44.020 --> 09:45.020
Very well.

09:45.088 --> 09:47.723
I will emulate my acting inspiration.

09:47.791 --> 09:49.458
A woman of profound poise whose career

09:49.526 --> 09:51.460
Is what we all aspire to.

09:51.528 --> 09:52.895
- Okay, this build-up is making me nervous.

09:52.962 --> 09:54.696
A woman whose feminine
grace and normal outfits

09:54.764 --> 09:55.964
Are an inspiration.

09:56.032 --> 09:57.199
Just say who it is and I'll feel better.

09:57.267 --> 09:58.767
Someone whose very name stands

09:58.835 --> 10:01.036
For enduring beauty and
the wonder of womanhood.

10:01.104 --> 10:04.072
- Please don't say--
- madonna!

10:04.140 --> 10:05.307
[sighs]

10:05.375 --> 10:07.075
Hey, danny.

10:07.143 --> 10:08.777
Hey, liz.

10:08.845 --> 10:10.712
Look, I know we're supposed to pretape

10:10.780 --> 10:12.748
That robot v. Wade cold open tonight,

10:12.816 --> 10:14.216
But jack said I can skip it and go

10:14.284 --> 10:15.317
To the rangers game with him.

10:15.385 --> 10:16.552
Yeah, sure, you can go,

10:16.619 --> 10:19.488
But, um, we have to talk.

10:19.556 --> 10:22.191
Okay.

10:22.258 --> 10:25.461
Richard, would you excuse us please?

10:25.528 --> 10:26.862
What's up?

10:26.930 --> 10:28.831
Meet me in my office in five minutes.

10:28.898 --> 10:30.365
Well, just let me change.

10:30.433 --> 10:32.501
Ah! Mmm, no. That won't be necessary...

10:32.569 --> 10:35.003
Officer.

10:35.071 --> 10:37.372
[whistling]

10:37.440 --> 10:38.373
What are you happy about?

10:38.441 --> 10:39.374
[gasps] did we get canceled?

10:39.442 --> 10:41.376
Can't a girl just be happy?

10:44.714 --> 10:46.248
Oh, no. Jenna, don't do this.

10:46.316 --> 10:47.416
Hang on.

10:47.484 --> 10:48.917
I'm just tweeting that I ran into you.

10:48.985 --> 10:50.452
This is so tandem.

10:50.520 --> 10:51.587
"random," jenna.

10:51.654 --> 10:53.555
Those kids are saying the word "random."

10:53.623 --> 10:55.880
Ow! Come on, you guys! Stop it!

10:55.947 --> 10:57.548
Turn it off, frank. - [chuckles]

10:57.616 --> 10:58.083
What's going on?

10:58.150 --> 10:59.551
What are you doing to cerie?

10:59.618 --> 11:00.719
- Frank downloaded this high-pitched tone

11:00.786 --> 11:02.787
That can only be heard by young ears.

11:02.855 --> 11:04.089
They use it in japan to keep kids

11:04.156 --> 11:07.058
From loitering outside
of convenience stores.

11:07.126 --> 11:08.426
Cerie's the only one that can hear it.

11:08.494 --> 11:09.961
The rest of us are too old.

11:10.029 --> 11:11.096
Oh! Not me!

11:11.163 --> 11:12.564
I can hear it!

11:12.631 --> 11:15.066
Oh! My ears are, like, dying.

11:15.134 --> 11:17.135
Ahh! Facebook!

11:17.203 --> 11:18.603
Um, I already turned it off.

11:18.671 --> 11:19.904
[laughter]

11:19.972 --> 11:22.474
I also have this low-frequency tone

11:22.541 --> 11:26.478
That can only be heard by people over 40.

11:26.545 --> 11:29.013
Have you started playing it yet?

11:29.081 --> 11:31.916
[laughter]

11:31.984 --> 11:33.251
Ah!

11:33.319 --> 11:37.722
Lemon, can I speak with you for a moment?

11:37.790 --> 11:40.792
What is happening to me?

11:43.161 --> 11:44.428
Danny and I were supposed
to have lunch today.

11:44.496 --> 11:45.896
Why didn't he show up? - I don't know.

11:45.964 --> 11:47.565
Maybe he had something better to do.

11:47.633 --> 11:49.834
Well, I had a porterhouse for two alone.

11:49.901 --> 11:51.369
I am very angry and sleepy.

11:54.106 --> 11:56.073
<i>This is from danny's chips costume.</i>

11:56.141 --> 11:57.275
What is it doing here?

11:57.342 --> 11:59.143
Officer, what's going on up there?

11:59.211 --> 12:01.345
It's an accident.

12:01.413 --> 12:03.447
A really bad one.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.182
- [gasps]
- mmm.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.918
This badge is a symbol of dignity, honor,

12:07.986 --> 12:10.655
And dramatized 1970s inter-ethnic california

12:10.722 --> 12:12.456
Daytime motorcycle highway justice.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.281
I'm sorry, jack. I changed my mind.

12:14.349 --> 12:16.183
I'm trying to look out
for the show here, lemon.

12:16.251 --> 12:17.284
Yeah, I don't think you are.

12:17.352 --> 12:19.753
While stuck in a pile-up

12:19.821 --> 12:21.622
On the pacific coast highway earlier,

12:21.690 --> 12:23.357
I realized something.

12:23.425 --> 12:24.725
You take danny away from work

12:24.793 --> 12:26.126
Whenever you want to hang out.

12:26.194 --> 12:27.494
I don't think this is about the show.

12:27.562 --> 12:29.230
I think you have some sort of problem

12:29.297 --> 12:31.098
With the fact that danny is with me.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.933
For four years I've had to make do

12:33.001 --> 12:34.768
With what passes for men in this place.

12:34.836 --> 12:37.905
With their untucked shirts, boneless faces,

12:37.973 --> 12:39.907
Their stars, both wars and trek.

12:39.975 --> 12:42.509
I needed a man around here
and I finally have one.

12:42.577 --> 12:44.178
i>- No, I finally have one.

12:44.246 --> 12:46.313
Liz lemon has a handsome, goof-around,

12:46.381 --> 12:47.548
Make-out buddy.

12:47.616 --> 12:48.849
And that's the problem.

12:48.917 --> 12:50.651
Danny can't be my alpha-male wingman

12:50.719 --> 12:52.186
And his boss'...

12:52.254 --> 12:54.021
Little scrump nugget.

12:54.089 --> 12:55.189
They're incompatible.

12:55.257 --> 12:56.824
Well, then I guess it's on.

12:56.891 --> 12:58.192
May the best man win.

12:58.260 --> 12:59.360
Oh, he will.

12:59.427 --> 13:00.928
[door closes]

13:03.832 --> 13:04.999
Where you going?

13:05.066 --> 13:06.400
It's board game night.

13:06.468 --> 13:08.402
- Out.
- Out with whom?

13:08.470 --> 13:09.703
This guy doug.

13:09.771 --> 13:11.839
Well, does doug have a last name?

13:11.906 --> 13:13.240
Okay, everybody. Let's just--

13:13.308 --> 13:15.009
You can't make me stay here!

13:15.076 --> 13:16.844
You are a part of this entourage.

13:16.911 --> 13:18.912
I didn't ask to be in this entourage!

13:18.980 --> 13:20.881
Look! I know you didn't mean that.

13:20.949 --> 13:23.284
I do mean it. I'm not like you!

13:23.351 --> 13:26.053
I'll never be like you!

13:26.121 --> 13:28.222
[door closes]

13:29.290 --> 13:32.048
And now I'm at the point
where I love just kissing.

13:32.116 --> 13:35.185
We kiss for an hour,
and it's totally enough for me.

13:35.252 --> 13:36.252
- Uh
-huh.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.788
This is good guy talk.

13:38.856 --> 13:40.390
She has really thin lips, but she makes up

13:40.458 --> 13:42.192
For it with tongue girth.

13:42.259 --> 13:43.426
Okay, maybe we just watch the game,

13:43.494 --> 13:44.794
Forget about girls for a night.

13:44.862 --> 13:46.396
Yeah! [cheering]

13:46.464 --> 13:47.597
Whoo!

13:47.665 --> 13:48.798
You know, my little cuddlebaby

13:48.866 --> 13:49.966
Loves to watch figure skating,

13:50.034 --> 13:52.537
And I'm really starting to get into that.

13:54.605 --> 13:55.839
And now turning to women's health.

13:55.906 --> 13:58.408
Our latest information on
women's sexuality finds

13:58.476 --> 14:00.143
Female libido does tend to peak

14:00.211 --> 14:02.412
In those years just before perimenopause

14:02.480 --> 14:05.582
In what scientists and doctors like myself

14:05.649 --> 14:06.983
Are calling their dirty 30s.

14:07.051 --> 14:08.551
Women are also looking at the latest--

14:08.619 --> 14:12.255
I got to go, jack.

14:12.323 --> 14:13.523
What?

14:13.591 --> 14:14.591
You're leaving?

14:14.658 --> 14:15.925
It's only zero-zero.

14:15.993 --> 14:18.595
I'll talk to you in the morning.

14:18.662 --> 14:20.830
Liz lemon.

14:28.004 --> 14:30.105
That was a low blow last night, lemon.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.574
What can I say, jack?

14:31.641 --> 14:33.375
I guess I'm getting a second wind here

14:33.443 --> 14:35.110
At the tail end of my dirty 30s.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.612
Lord, this whole week
has been such a bummer.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.014
Hey, when did we add
this grizzly adams sketch?

14:39.082 --> 14:41.050
I wrote it last night...Late.

14:41.117 --> 14:46.956
The shirt should be... Filthier.

14:47.023 --> 14:48.491
If you were a man,
you would have to register

14:48.558 --> 14:49.859
Yourself as a sex criminal.

14:49.926 --> 14:51.494
I'm taking danny back.
Oh, good luck with that.

14:51.561 --> 14:52.795
Remember, if it doesn't work out,

14:52.863 --> 14:54.119
There's always lutz.

14:54.187 --> 14:56.188
[screams]

14:58.992 --> 15:01.393
* forever young *

15:01.461 --> 15:03.028
* I want to be *

15:03.096 --> 15:04.930
* forever young *

15:04.998 --> 15:06.832
Jenna, stop it!

15:06.900 --> 15:08.100
Ow.

15:08.168 --> 15:10.436
Look, you claimed that
you want to be happy,

15:10.503 --> 15:11.804
But that's never gonna happen

15:11.871 --> 15:13.806
Until you are honest about who you are.

15:13.873 --> 15:15.307
That's easy for you to say.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.409
I've built my career on a certain image

15:17.477 --> 15:19.745
And you have no idea what I
go through to maintain it.

15:19.813 --> 15:22.681
The workouts, the lotions,
pretending I wasn't

15:22.749 --> 15:25.050
Fourth runner-up at the miss
teen bicentennial pageant.

15:25.118 --> 15:26.552
Ooh, that's--

15:26.619 --> 15:28.086
And you don't understand
the fear I live with.

15:28.154 --> 15:30.456
The fear of people ever seeing the real me.

15:30.523 --> 15:31.690
Yes, I do.

15:31.758 --> 15:34.259
We all have secrets.

15:34.327 --> 15:36.428
You know that I have
something I've been hiding

15:36.496 --> 15:38.163
From the world for 20 years.

15:38.231 --> 15:39.231
What are you talking about?

15:39.299 --> 15:43.802
If you come out as your real age,

15:43.870 --> 15:46.638
I will reveal my friend tom.

15:46.706 --> 15:48.474
[gasps]

15:48.541 --> 15:50.809
You would do that for me?

15:50.877 --> 15:52.177
How long would it take?

15:52.245 --> 15:53.345
Well, if I do nothing,

15:53.413 --> 15:56.348
He'll be here within 48 hours.

15:56.416 --> 15:57.816
Ow.

15:57.884 --> 16:00.552
Good morning, li--

16:00.620 --> 16:02.621
[gasps]

16:07.026 --> 16:08.694
[gasps]

16:08.761 --> 16:09.754
Oh...My...God.

16:12.822 --> 16:14.923
I'd like you all to meet tom.

16:14.991 --> 16:17.459
Tom selleck.

16:17.527 --> 16:19.027
He's my moustache.

16:19.095 --> 16:21.530
Thank you, liz.

16:21.597 --> 16:23.398
It's funny.

16:23.466 --> 16:28.703
All my "a-ha" moments end with
a moustache pressed against me.

16:30.071 --> 16:30.772
There you are!

16:31.340 --> 16:34.008
Kenneth and I were worried sick about you.

16:34.076 --> 16:37.245
I think doug put something in
my drink and I don't remember--

16:37.313 --> 16:38.546
That's not important anymore.

16:38.614 --> 16:40.381
I want to talk to you about
our fight the other night.

16:40.449 --> 16:43.551
Look, having a girl in
your life is different.

16:43.619 --> 16:46.354
You want to protect her,
and the best that you can hope for

16:46.422 --> 16:48.289
Is that someday a nice man will come

16:48.357 --> 16:49.290
And take her from you.

16:49.358 --> 16:50.692
That's it.

16:50.759 --> 16:54.195
Hey, sue, I need you in the writer's room.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.797
[tearfully] I knew this day would come.

16:55.864 --> 16:58.599
I just didn't think it would be so soon.

17:01.904 --> 17:03.504
You take good care of her.

17:04.839 --> 17:06.174
<i>[alphaville's forever young]</i>

17:06.241 --> 17:08.142
* forever young *

17:08.210 --> 17:13.281
* I want to be forever young *

17:13.348 --> 17:16.751
* do you really want to live forever *

17:16.819 --> 17:18.752
* forever *

17:18.820 --> 17:19.854
* and ever *

17:19.922 --> 17:22.557
* forever young *

17:22.624 --> 17:26.127
* I want to be forever young *

17:26.994 --> 17:29.196
I don't know if I can go through this

17:29.264 --> 17:30.397
With a real daughter.

17:30.465 --> 17:31.221
Yes, you can.

17:31.289 --> 17:33.657
I know that was hard, but I bet

17:33.725 --> 17:34.825
You wouldn't give up this week

17:34.892 --> 17:36.960
With miss laroche vanderhoot for anything.

17:37.028 --> 17:39.196
No, I wouldn't.

17:39.263 --> 17:41.331
Not for a billion doll hairs.

17:41.399 --> 17:43.600
I'm sorry. Did you say "doll hairs"?

17:43.668 --> 17:45.535
Yeah, they're not worth nothing.

17:45.603 --> 17:47.237
You could probably sell
'em to a doll company

17:47.305 --> 17:48.939
And get maybe 40 grand for 'em.

17:49.006 --> 17:50.640
[chuckles]

17:50.708 --> 17:52.175
Danny.

17:52.243 --> 17:54.344
Danny, I know.

17:54.412 --> 17:56.847
I know liz is your secret work girlfriend.

17:56.914 --> 17:58.782
[sighs]

17:58.850 --> 18:00.383
I wanted to tell you, but she thought

18:00.451 --> 18:01.418
We should be discreet.

18:01.486 --> 18:03.120
I mean, we're just having fun.

18:03.187 --> 18:04.387
I know.

18:04.455 --> 18:05.655
You need to end it now.

18:05.723 --> 18:07.157
What? Why?

18:07.225 --> 18:09.626
I never told anyone this.

18:09.694 --> 18:11.595
And that's why if you ask people about it,

18:11.662 --> 18:13.530
They won't know what you're talking about,

18:13.598 --> 18:16.666
Because it's a secret,
not because it's a lie.

18:16.734 --> 18:18.201
- Okay, I understand.
- Good.

18:18.269 --> 18:20.670
Now here's my secret.

18:20.738 --> 18:24.875
My secret is...

18:24.942 --> 18:26.443
I'm in love with liz lemon.

18:26.511 --> 18:27.944
What?

18:28.012 --> 18:29.446
It's true.

18:29.514 --> 18:31.314
It was love at first sight.

18:31.382 --> 18:34.684
I ache for her sexually.

18:34.752 --> 18:36.453
How could I not?

18:36.521 --> 18:40.657
I'm entranced by those mud-colored eyes,

18:40.725 --> 18:43.293
Set back in...That skin.

18:43.361 --> 18:45.295
And her laugh.

18:45.363 --> 18:46.696
Her walk.

18:46.764 --> 18:48.023
That splay-footed walk.

18:50.091 --> 18:53.326
And that...

18:53.394 --> 18:55.862
Whole situation right there.

18:55.930 --> 18:57.697
And--

18:57.765 --> 18:59.532
Oh.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.202
Moustache?

19:02.269 --> 19:03.737
Good god, lemon.

19:03.804 --> 19:06.706
Jack, I had no idea.

19:06.774 --> 19:09.509
I mean, the last thing I want to
do is screw up our friendship.

19:09.577 --> 19:11.511
Me and liz, I'll end it today.

19:11.579 --> 19:13.546
You'd do that for me?

19:13.614 --> 19:14.748
- Mmm!
- Whoa!

19:14.815 --> 19:18.184
Yeah, I think I'll be okay.

19:18.252 --> 19:19.452
Oh, mother.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.255
I can't believe you're dying of old age.

19:22.323 --> 19:24.924
Don't cry for me, tartine.

19:24.992 --> 19:26.993
I've had a full life.

19:27.061 --> 19:29.095
Oh, the things I've seen.

19:29.163 --> 19:31.698
The first clinton administration.

19:31.766 --> 19:34.467
The nagano olympics.

19:34.535 --> 19:36.936
Microsoft windows '95.

19:37.004 --> 19:40.974
But I'm 41 now.

19:41.041 --> 19:43.109
Time to die.

19:43.177 --> 19:45.111
[sobbing]

19:45.179 --> 19:46.446
And cut!

19:46.514 --> 19:51.518
[applause]

19:55.188 --> 19:57.122
[dance music]

19:57.190 --> 20:01.226
So danny says that he and
I can't hook up anymore.

20:01.294 --> 20:02.294
And I am taking him to the fight

20:02.362 --> 20:03.529
At the garden tomorrow night.

20:03.596 --> 20:05.230
I guess the best man won.

20:05.298 --> 20:06.532
- Uh
-huh.

20:06.599 --> 20:07.856
Well, the reason that he gave me was that

20:07.924 --> 20:10.358
Someone else here is in love with me.

20:10.426 --> 20:13.528
It was my only move, lemon,
and it was hard, believe me.

20:13.596 --> 20:15.597
What did you say you loved about me?

20:15.665 --> 20:17.966
Did you talk about my body?

20:18.034 --> 20:20.969
Did you say how you like to watch me dance?

20:21.037 --> 20:23.004
Yeah. You like that?

20:23.072 --> 20:24.306
You're embarrassing yourself, lemon.

20:24.373 --> 20:25.540
- Mm-hmm. It started out as a joke,

20:25.608 --> 20:27.743
But it's becoming real.

20:31.781 --> 20:33.281
I don't care!

20:33.349 --> 20:34.883
I'm having a good time!
