Okay?

26:17.333 --> 26:18.125
I will take it

26:18.125 --> 26:21.291
any way you want

26:21.291 --> 26:23.500
to give it to me.

Hey, Rafe.

26:33.166 --> 26:35.583
Losing your mind?

26:35.583 --> 26:39.333
I'd rather lose my mime.

26:39.333 --> 26:40.750
[laughter]

26:40.750 --> 26:42.959
Well, at least it's quiet.
Right, Jessica?

26:46.750 --> 26:48.875
[Matt] So Rafe, any regrets
about spending all your points

- ...to put Danika...
- Hey.

26:50.250 --> 26:51.792
- [Matt] ...in that sumo suit?
- Hey.

26:51.792 --> 26:53.875
I tried calling last night.
You didn't pick up.

26:53.875 --> 26:54.709
Something was messed up
with my phone.

26:54.709 --> 26:56.333
- Oh.
- I was on with the IT guy

26:56.333 --> 26:58.750
- ...for an hour.
- Ugh.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.417
Three scariest words

27:00.417 --> 27:02.542
"go to settings."

Well, I missed you.

Hey, what are you doing here?

27:25.792 --> 27:28.041
Want to do a show?

Seriously?

27:28.792 --> 27:29.917
Sign us up.

27:29.917 --> 27:32.291
Woo-hoo!

27:32.291 --> 27:36.208
[sighs] All right,
but this is the last time.

27:36.208 --> 27:37.250
Ahh!

When can we start?
I got a really good idea.

27:39.166 --> 27:39.709
Really?

27:39.709 --> 27:41.542
Yeah, I'm this guy

27:41.542 --> 27:42.542
who gets killed
in a car accident,

27:42.542 --> 27:45.125
and I come back
as a dog.

27:45.125 --> 27:46.875
Huh?
And my wife adopts me

27:46.875 --> 27:47.917
because she senses
this connection.

27:47.917 --> 27:51.083
And I'm living with her
and her new husband.

27:51.083 --> 27:52.375
Okay, now, the audience

27:52.375 --> 27:53.834
sees me as me.

27:53.834 --> 27:56.667
But everyone on the show
sees me as a dog.

27:56.667 --> 27:58.750
And I have to, like...

27:58.750 --> 28:00.583
...crap outside and,

28:00.583 --> 28:02.792
and other dogs are humping me.

28:02.792 --> 28:04.500
Huh?

28:04.500 --> 28:06.875
- Let-let's-let's, let's, uh...
- That could be fun.

28:06.875 --> 28:08.125

- It certainly--

Matt, we're back.
