Ah, the carnival.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.160
What can make
you feel more alive

00:30.204 --> 00:32.510
than hastily-constructed
thrill rides?

00:32.554 --> 00:35.905
Will I be mangled?
Won't I be mangled?
I don't know.

00:35.948 --> 00:39.517
I very much enjoy
the cotton that is candied.

00:39.561 --> 00:40.692
Mmm.

00:40.736 --> 00:42.042
I just want to play
those sick games,

00:42.085 --> 00:43.869
and win some prizes, baby.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.219
Yo, who are those creeps?

00:54.402 --> 00:56.708
Those are the carnies.
They run the games.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.406
Oh, how wonderful!

00:58.449 --> 00:59.668
Thank you, sweet carnies,

00:59.711 --> 01:02.149
for bringing joy
to all the world.

01:02.192 --> 01:06.066
No, Star, their job is to rig
the game, so nobody ever wins.

01:06.109 --> 01:07.632
Evil!

01:09.678 --> 01:11.723
So, we can't win
those big prizes?

01:11.767 --> 01:13.551
Not if the carnies
have their way.

01:13.595 --> 01:16.424
But, I want a horsey-horsey now, yo!

01:16.467 --> 01:18.556
You'll get your stuffed
horsey, Beast Boy,

01:18.600 --> 01:20.080
because these carnies have never

01:20.123 --> 01:22.908
gone up against the Teen Titans.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.084
Titans, go!

01:48.586 --> 01:50.849
I told you the carnies
wouldn't let us win.

01:50.893 --> 01:53.548
You were right.
Star, don't waste your money.

01:53.591 --> 01:54.592
But I must!

01:54.636 --> 01:57.247
I must win
the golden fish prize.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.553
Star, no.

01:58.596 --> 02:00.555
This is the cruelest
of carnie games.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.774
- Because it is the rigged too?
- No.

02:02.818 --> 02:05.342
Because it's the only one that's not.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.388
You'll probably win your fish,

02:07.431 --> 02:11.087
- but no matter what you do,
it'll be belly up within days.

02:13.872 --> 02:15.918
Well, I shall defy
these carnies.

02:15.961 --> 02:17.833
I vow, that the power of my love

02:17.876 --> 02:20.923
will keep the golden fish
alive for many years.

02:23.012 --> 02:27.277
All right, Star.
All you have to do is toss a ball into a bowl.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.539
I believe in you.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.862
Yay, yay, yay!

02:46.905 --> 02:49.169
I have won the golden fish.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.040
Ooh, and the plastic baggy.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.607
Ooh, and the fish water.

02:52.650 --> 02:55.436
It is like three prizes
in the one.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.220
Ew!

02:58.613 --> 02:59.701
The tangy.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.746
Uh, guys,
we better get out of here.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.444
I think we riled up the carnies.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.794
Oh, yeah.
They're giving us the stink eye.

03:08.710 --> 03:11.103
They smell of
the regular eye to me.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.367
Goodbye, the carnies.

03:15.804 --> 03:17.632
Oh, the fish, the fish.

03:17.675 --> 03:20.243
♪ He swims through the air ♪

03:20.287 --> 03:21.984
♪ La, la, la ♪

03:23.377 --> 03:25.857
Star, you really shouldn't
get too attached.

03:25.901 --> 03:28.686
Yeah.
That fish is gonna croak soon, remember?

03:28.730 --> 03:32.734
This fish has the name
I have dubbed him...

03:36.390 --> 03:38.174
Hey, the fish kicked the bucket.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.134
Oh, my bad.
He's alive.

03:42.178 --> 03:44.267
I was just looking at that
piece of toast over there.

03:46.313 --> 03:50.534
Thank goodness! I knew that
my love would keep him alive.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.406
Love and maybe some clean water.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.582
His current water is
not the acceptable?

03:54.625 --> 03:57.062
He's basically swimming
in his own juices.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.325
Pretty nasty.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.675
It is not the nasty.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.242
Ew.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.722
If you want to extend your
pet's life by a few hours,

04:04.766 --> 04:07.334
there are five essential
things goldfish need to live.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.074
Number one, a fish bowl.

04:09.118 --> 04:11.338
Two, clean water.

04:11.381 --> 04:14.384
Three, a bunch of pink,
and only pink pebbles.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.690
Four, fish food.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.648
And five, a tiny decorative log

04:17.692 --> 04:20.608
that the fish will
constantly get stuck in.

04:21.826 --> 04:25.569
The fish is happy now
in his lovely bowl,

04:25.613 --> 04:28.833
and I may still enjoy
the baggy of the fish water.

04:30.748 --> 04:32.576
Ew.

04:32.620 --> 04:36.276
The life of the fish will be long
and comfortable in his new home.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.929
Long life.
Ha, ha.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.235
I give him a day, tops.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.759
Day and a half, I'm an optimist.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.240
I have told you
that the power of my love

04:44.284 --> 04:47.504
will keep the fish alive
for many years.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.158
And we will grow old together,

04:49.201 --> 04:52.292
and I will give him
his old the fish medicines,

04:52.335 --> 04:54.946
and it will be wonderful.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.426
Now, the fish,

04:56.470 --> 04:59.690
let us enjoy the day's
activities together.

06:07.541 --> 06:11.153
Sweet dreams and we will
play again tomorrow.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.422
The fish is the deceased!

06:24.427 --> 06:25.515
Well, yeah.

06:25.559 --> 06:26.864
- Saw that coming.
- Bummer.

06:26.908 --> 06:30.738
But why?
Why?

06:30.781 --> 06:33.523
That's what carnival fish do,
they croak.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.177
I told you not to get attached.

06:35.220 --> 06:39.399
Star, wait!
Look, the fish, he's alive!

06:39.442 --> 06:41.139
He is?

06:41.183 --> 06:42.880
Oh, no. My bad.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.491
It was just that
piece of toast again.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.330
Ew.

07:09.951 --> 07:14.259
I thought if I loved him enough,

07:14.303 --> 07:15.739
he would live.

07:15.783 --> 07:18.002
Star, it's not your fault,
it's the carnies.

07:18.046 --> 07:20.222
No.
It is my fault.

07:26.576 --> 07:29.100
Hey, Star, you got
a ghost fish haunting you.

07:31.102 --> 07:33.931
Banunu.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.498
"Banunu"?

07:35.542 --> 07:37.935
What does the "banunu" mean?

07:38.501 --> 07:41.504
Banunu.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.680
I'll look it up in
the fish dictionary.

07:43.724 --> 07:46.378
It says here, that
banunu means "friend",

07:46.422 --> 07:50.034
and friendship means
no fish gets left behind.

07:50.078 --> 07:52.515
Star, the fish ghost
has unfinished business,

07:52.559 --> 07:55.823
and it needs our help to free its
family from the evil carnies.

07:56.301 --> 07:57.999
Banunu.

07:58.042 --> 08:01.959
The fish, my love was not
enough to keep you alive,

08:02.003 --> 08:04.309
but it will be enough
to right the wrongs

08:04.353 --> 08:05.920
and finish the business.

08:05.963 --> 08:09.140
Show us the way, the ghost fish.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.841
Banunu.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.543
Starfire, you rescue
the goldfish,

08:20.587 --> 08:22.327
we'll keep the carnies busy.

08:22.371 --> 08:23.546
Titans, go!

08:35.602 --> 08:39.083
How about a little
of the old pow!

08:41.433 --> 08:43.653
Fishies, quickly into the baggy.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.201
Now come with me, the fishies,

09:10.245 --> 09:13.161
and you will be free
to swim in the ocean.

09:19.297 --> 09:22.257
The fish have been flushed
to the freedom.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.388
Ha-ha!

09:23.432 --> 09:24.694
The victory!

09:29.351 --> 09:30.744
Yay, yay, yay!

09:30.787 --> 09:32.659
Yeah, Star, that doesn't
go to the sewer.

09:32.702 --> 09:35.618
Yeah, you just dropped those
fish into a bunch of poop.

09:36.706 --> 09:39.361
So, I have failed again?

09:44.671 --> 09:46.934
What is this?

09:48.544 --> 09:50.502
They're happy to be ghosts?

09:50.546 --> 09:52.940
I suppose it is better
than living in a tiny bowl

09:52.983 --> 09:54.724
and swimming
in a circle all day.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.987
So, I did not fail the fish.

09:57.031 --> 10:00.077
Nah, girl. You finished
that unfinished business.

10:00.121 --> 10:02.819
And all you had to do
was throw 'em in the business.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.300
How wonderful!

10:05.343 --> 10:06.780
Goodbye, the fish.

10:07.389 --> 10:09.739
Banunu.

10:09.783 --> 10:14.918
I shall always think of you, when I
enjoy the delicious algae water.
