WEBVTT

00:07.008 --> 00:12.002
(theme music playing )

00:29.405 --> 00:31.066
(grunts)

00:44.003 --> 00:45.994
Do you think me a fool?

00:46.172 --> 00:47.582
No, Dominus.

00:47.757 --> 00:49.713
Yet you dishonor me.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.795
An agreement reached,
an oath sworn--

00:51.969 --> 00:54.711
you would submit
to gladiatorial training,

00:54.889 --> 00:56.720
call me master,

00:56.891 --> 00:58.973
attend to the rules.

00:59.143 --> 01:02.101
In return, lwould search

01:02.271 --> 01:04.057
for your precious wife.

01:04.232 --> 01:07.349
But your haste bested you--

01:07.526 --> 01:09.391
defying Doctore,

01:09.570 --> 01:11.856
maneuvering to usurp Gnaeus
to face Crixus in the arena,

01:12.031 --> 01:16.070
your first contest with Crixus,

01:16.244 --> 01:18.360
the champion of fucking Capua.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.073
I realize the mistake in it.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.455
Mistake?

01:24.794 --> 01:28.412
Fuck, you had the crowd.

01:30.091 --> 01:33.583
You survived execution
against four of Solonius's men.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.047
Your name was on every tongue.

01:36.222 --> 01:40.431
Now after your showing with Crixus,
it's spoken of with contempt.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.762
Your little mistake

01:42.937 --> 01:45.929
makes reunion with your wife
problematic.

01:46.107 --> 01:47.768
You have knowledge of her?

01:51.612 --> 01:53.068
The Syrian Glaber sold her to

01:53.239 --> 01:55.275
was last noted heading north.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.781
We've yet to divine their destination.

01:57.952 --> 02:00.785
You must keep searching for her.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.571
You shit on honorable agreements

02:03.749 --> 02:06.126
and press for fresh demands?

02:06.294 --> 02:07.625
Tell me, Thracian,

02:07.795 --> 02:10.036
how will you pay for her release
if found, hmm?

02:10.214 --> 02:12.421
Her transport?

02:12.591 --> 02:14.673
Do you shoot magic coins
out of your ass?

02:14.844 --> 02:16.380
If so, squat and produce.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.294
I shall fight in the arena.
My winnings--

02:18.472 --> 02:21.134
No one wishes to see you fight.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.926
The crowd's favor, like the wind,
is fleeting.

02:25.104 --> 02:27.470
Their interest in you has blown out.

02:34.113 --> 02:36.104
There must be a way for me to fight.

02:36.282 --> 02:37.988
Only one,

02:38.159 --> 02:41.743
in a place where you needn't
follow rules, because none exist--

02:45.541 --> 02:47.907
the pits of the underworld.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.791
Fight there and survive,

02:49.962 --> 02:51.793
and you will fill both our hands
with coin

02:51.964 --> 02:54.205
and...

02:54.383 --> 02:57.500
you may yet feel
your wife's touch again.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.503
(grunts)

03:16.697 --> 03:18.358
( Barca laughs )

03:18.532 --> 03:20.193
Thracian bitch.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.154
Batiatus: Barca, release.

03:25.915 --> 03:28.201
I think your wife's binding
should remain here.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.038
Where you're going, you might lose it
along with an arm.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.509
Finish preparing him.

03:54.235 --> 03:55.566
A word, Dominus.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.397
lf hastened.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.232
The walls spread rumor of the pits.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.898
You find objection to this course?

04:02.076 --> 04:03.566
It is a place
of pain and suffering,

04:03.744 --> 04:06.781
beasts dying without honor.
Your father would never have--

04:06.956 --> 04:08.662
The decision is made.

04:08.833 --> 04:11.870
If a beast cannot be tamed,
it must be unleashed.

04:20.052 --> 04:22.088
If the rains ever return,

04:22.263 --> 04:25.175
I shall soak in a bath for a week.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.592
Perfume.

04:33.566 --> 04:35.807
Only a few drops remain, Domina.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.982
I shall save them for Jupiter.

04:41.157 --> 04:45.275
I will douse his altar and pray
that the scent sparks a deluge.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.785
Have you seen my dagger?
lt eludes me.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.116
What purpose requires it?

04:50.291 --> 04:55.160
l've divined an additional stream
of revenue,

04:55.337 --> 04:57.953
one that will provide us a proper bath.

04:58.132 --> 05:01.124
Oh, and this stream--

05:01.302 --> 05:03.543
it flows from what orifice?

05:05.139 --> 05:06.299
The pits.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.758
The pits.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.312
Look, Crixus remains
the single draw of the ludus.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.599
Of the new recruits, Varro is
the only man of promise.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.859
Spartacus and Kerza
prove worthless in the arena.

05:21.030 --> 05:23.316
So I fight them tonight
where they may yet fill our purse.

05:23.491 --> 05:26.528
Quintus,

05:26.702 --> 05:28.442
dispatching the Thracian
brings me relief.

05:28.621 --> 05:30.657
You descending into the pits
does not.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.993
lt stains the name
and threatens the body.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.329
My body will be well protected.
Barca looms over it,

05:36.504 --> 05:39.871
ready to break bone
at the slightest provocation.

05:40.049 --> 05:42.381
lnform Barca
that if you return scathed,

05:42.551 --> 05:44.132
I'll have his cock in ajar.

05:45.471 --> 05:48.338
The message will be
dutifully delivered.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.008
Give Crixus a woman tonight--

05:52.186 --> 05:54.142
motivation to the others

05:54.313 --> 05:57.680
that success brings decoration
in many forms.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.565
I'll see him well satisfied.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.375
Keep moving, you fuck.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.132
Where do they take him?

06:33.269 --> 06:36.557
To the underworld,
where he belongs.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.564
Back to training.

06:45.030 --> 06:49.615
Tell me I don't look like I have been
shit from a boar's ass like you.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.617
lam not dying in the pits.

06:57.668 --> 06:58.999
I'll show these fucking cunts

06:59.169 --> 07:01.296
my cock was forged in Vulcan's flames.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.328
lwill fuck them all!

07:23.777 --> 07:27.520
Crowd: Tear his ass open!
Rip his head off!

07:27.698 --> 07:30.565
Get up, get up, you useless--!

07:30.743 --> 07:31.903
Shit.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.532
(groaning)

08:15.579 --> 08:17.080
Shit.

08:25.923 --> 08:28.335
Ovidius approaches.

08:29.426 --> 08:32.259
Ovidius, good to lay eyes.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.590
I had expected them laid earlier.

08:34.765 --> 08:38.178
Our agreement calls for
the repayment of your debt plus 30%

08:38.352 --> 08:41.014
to be delivered the day after
the games of the vulcanalia.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.179
Yet | find you here,

08:43.357 --> 08:45.268
wagering coin still owed.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.433
You'll be first to receive what is due,
I assure you.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.442
Words spewed by Janus,

08:49.613 --> 08:52.525
from both sides of his face.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.612
You'll be repaid soon enough,

08:55.786 --> 08:57.947
unless you'd care to press the matter.

09:01.291 --> 09:04.124
At your convenience then.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.706
Until such time,

09:06.880 --> 09:09.622
the points still accrue.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.544
( spits ) Ass-eating shit.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.214
Speak to me such again,
I will accrue your fucking head.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.640
lxion-- victor.

09:28.444 --> 09:30.901
You want to face me?

09:37.244 --> 09:38.700
(gate clanging )

10:03.145 --> 10:06.433
May the gods fare you better, Thracian,

10:06.607 --> 10:07.938
for both our sakes.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.609
Your neck is bare of my gift.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.945
It is.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.201
You did not favor it then--

10:21.371 --> 10:22.747
the necklace I gave you?

10:22.915 --> 10:25.122
Lower your voice.

10:26.335 --> 10:29.122
Your gift-- I cannot accept it.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.634
Pardon my mistake.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.212
You must understand.
If Domina--

10:36.386 --> 10:38.877
You've made your intention clear.

10:51.819 --> 10:55.152
Does it excite you

10:55.322 --> 10:57.813
to know that your very footsteps

10:57.991 --> 11:00.403
moisten my thighs?

11:00.577 --> 11:02.909
lwould have them dripping
even more.

11:05.749 --> 11:08.491
Well, draw closer and make it so.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.676
What are you clutching?

11:18.679 --> 11:21.091
Show me.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.856
A humble gift...

11:32.025 --> 11:33.606
for a goddess.

11:35.988 --> 11:37.569
Put it on.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.616
Does it please you?

11:55.591 --> 11:57.377
Yes.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.542
( both moaning )

12:35.172 --> 12:39.290
Witness the captive beasts,

12:39.468 --> 12:42.676
quenching our thirst with blood,

12:42.846 --> 12:46.304
set to die in the pits--

12:46.475 --> 12:49.808
payment for their offensive births.

12:49.978 --> 12:53.095
Let death descend anew.

12:54.441 --> 12:58.275
Behold Myrmex.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.988
Behold Spartacus.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.444
( booing )

13:07.537 --> 13:09.698
The crowd does not seem to favor him.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.410
Why would they,
after his showing in the arena?

13:12.584 --> 13:15.792
What weapons shall the gods
bless them with?

13:15.963 --> 13:17.919
Or curse them

13:18.090 --> 13:20.126
with empty hands?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.461
Choose your fate.

13:29.184 --> 13:33.097
Myrmex draws sphairai.

13:44.074 --> 13:47.737
Spartacus draws caestus.

13:58.213 --> 14:00.829
Myrmex has the advantage.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.499
Thank you for the fucking obvious.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.510
We have but a single rule--

14:06.680 --> 14:08.511
only one survives;

14:09.516 --> 14:12.178
mongrel on mongrel

14:12.352 --> 14:14.968
till Charon arrives.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.685
What do you make of the odds?

14:18.859 --> 14:21.191
Four to one against our man,

14:21.361 --> 14:23.522
maybe five.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.655
Place 10 denarii on Spartacus
and pray for ample return.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.190
Dominus.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.988
Men: Come on!

14:34.583 --> 14:36.369
Rip his face off.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.230
( roars )

15:12.496 --> 15:13.906
Do something!

15:40.732 --> 15:42.939
Yeah!

15:46.947 --> 15:49.563
Spartacus-- victor.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.281
Give him a moment's rest,

15:55.455 --> 15:57.696
then fight him again.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.637
You're hurt.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.060
I'm all right.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.435
You push yourself too far.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.695
And yet I live.

16:30.866 --> 16:33.073
For how long?

16:33.243 --> 16:34.733
As long as it takes.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.822
Then kill them all.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.033
( inhales sharply )

16:52.429 --> 16:55.341
Do you plan to return to the pits?

16:56.433 --> 16:58.594
They fill our hands with coin,

16:58.768 --> 17:01.851
with yet more to be mined.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.809
And what when the shaft
caves in on you?

17:05.984 --> 17:07.849
What then?

17:08.028 --> 17:11.361
You know the law-- without an heir
I'd be forced to marry another.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.692
Is that what you want--
somebody else's hands upon me?

17:13.867 --> 17:17.530
I want everything...

17:19.915 --> 17:22.907
yet can afford nothing.

17:24.461 --> 17:27.624
My concern's only with you, Quintus.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.214
If you're lost,

17:31.384 --> 17:33.636
my reason for breath
would surely follow.

17:33.803 --> 17:36.055
I remain firmly rooted.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.464
Banish it from thought.

17:38.642 --> 17:40.633
When Spartacus ends,
so does my time in the pits.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.971
Till then, his victories
swell our purse...

17:47.275 --> 17:50.062
which you deflate
with new purchases.

17:50.237 --> 17:54.071
This simple thing?
lts rediscovery today pleased me.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.152
It was my mother's,
lost amongst her things.

17:56.326 --> 17:59.068
A woman of modest taste,
sorely missed.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.111
Perhaps we should return
the emerald necklace

18:01.289 --> 18:03.029
we bought from Ramel.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.744
Well, it was excessive.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.409
And if the coin will help speed you
from the pits I'd be--

18:07.587 --> 18:09.293
Keep them both.

18:09.464 --> 18:11.830
I will not have my wife
return jewelry.

18:15.262 --> 18:18.720
I should wash.
| smell of death.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.676
No, you smell like a man.

18:24.396 --> 18:26.808
(moaning)

18:52.299 --> 18:53.960
You live.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.592
I told you he would.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.973
What of Kerza?

19:01.975 --> 19:04.182
Fallen,

19:04.352 --> 19:06.434
never to rise whole.

19:09.774 --> 19:14.438
This is where gladiators sleep,
notdogs.

19:14.612 --> 19:18.150
Hold your tongue.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.486
He stays--

19:20.660 --> 19:23.618
he wakes beside Kerza
in the afterlife.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.018
Spartacus,

19:46.186 --> 19:48.347
pay no mind to those inbred fucks.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.263
They speak the truth.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.523
lam no longer a gladiator.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.853
You are still a man.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.063
Am I?

19:56.237 --> 19:58.193
One deserving respect.

19:58.365 --> 20:01.528
Though l'll grant the pits could force
Jupiter himself to doubt his cock.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.317
What do you know of the pits?

20:04.496 --> 20:06.361
Too much.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.701
l wagered coin there at a time.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.208
You were of the crowd,

20:12.379 --> 20:14.040
howling for blood?

20:16.174 --> 20:18.711
Pride does not follow
the statement.

20:21.388 --> 20:25.051
These fights, Spartacus, they're--

20:25.225 --> 20:27.056
they're different from the arena.

20:27.227 --> 20:30.515
I've seen them twist the mind,

20:30.688 --> 20:33.600
turning men into beasts,

20:33.775 --> 20:37.563
their senses flown.

20:42.075 --> 20:45.784
Sleep then,

20:45.954 --> 20:48.536
and dream of better days.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.849
Would you have me bake in the sun
or offer a price?

21:09.102 --> 21:11.514
14 denarii.

21:11.688 --> 21:12.894
14?

21:13.064 --> 21:15.441
That's half of what I paid
not days ago.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.985
Used gems fail to command
full value.

21:18.153 --> 21:19.233
Oh.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.395
Oh, in the business ofjewelry--
perhaps.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.609
Oh, a beautiful piece.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.869
Allow me to buy from you

21:30.039 --> 21:32.121
at full price.

21:32.292 --> 21:36.410
You have a woman in mind
who might favor it, Solonius?

21:36.588 --> 21:38.453
lndeed.

21:38.631 --> 21:42.590
She stands before me--

21:42.760 --> 21:45.092
a vision.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.128
Take it,

21:47.307 --> 21:48.717
and keep your emeralds.

21:48.892 --> 21:52.305
The thought of them against your skin
warms mine.

21:52.479 --> 21:56.142
Perhaps you mistake
the heat of the sun.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.523
I'll have your offer, Ramel.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.149
Pride--

22:00.320 --> 22:02.436
always part of your
considerable attraction.

22:02.614 --> 22:04.980
A trait which yet endears me
to my husband.

22:06.159 --> 22:08.070
How is he fairing these days?

22:08.244 --> 22:10.576
Beloved Ovidius
mentioned something

22:10.747 --> 22:13.329
about fighting his men in the pits.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.826
It's a temporary measure.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.995
Oh, to be sure.

22:21.090 --> 22:25.550
I pray fortune swiftly returns
to his favor,

22:25.720 --> 22:28.302
so we may battle once again

22:28.473 --> 22:30.634
in the arena

22:30.808 --> 22:32.799
with honor.

22:35.939 --> 22:37.270
14 denarii.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.523
May the gods shrivel your cock.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.617
Study the flaws of your opponent.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.199
Strike with your mind

22:54.374 --> 22:56.706
as well as your sword.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.413
Fail to use your wits in the arena,

22:59.587 --> 23:02.499
and risk tumbling after Spartacus

23:02.674 --> 23:04.210
into the pits.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.875
( men laugh )

23:08.638 --> 23:10.970
The man is no base humor
to be laughed at.

23:12.517 --> 23:14.098
He is a tale of caution.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.811
Ponder on that

23:18.982 --> 23:21.394
while you fill your bellies.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.058
Eat.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.989
A little porridge and some water.

23:37.166 --> 23:40.374
It's just a sip,
but, you know, the drought--

23:40.545 --> 23:42.752
Pietros,

23:42.922 --> 23:45.208
get away from him.

23:45.383 --> 23:47.874
Thank you.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.308
Your boy fancy the Thracian,
does he?

23:57.478 --> 24:00.265
My cock keeps him well filled.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.556
( laughs)

24:02.734 --> 24:04.565
The beast of Carthage,

24:04.736 --> 24:07.773
| always wondered
how you acquired the name.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.108
If you have words of purpose,
speak them.

24:10.283 --> 24:14.777
l was merely curious, Crixus.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.240
The gift I procured for you--

24:17.415 --> 24:18.871
did it satisfy its intent?

24:19.042 --> 24:20.122
Gift?

24:20.293 --> 24:22.625
Yeah, an opal necklace
of the finest--

24:22.795 --> 24:25.411
Your tongue rattles too freely
in your mouth.

24:25.590 --> 24:28.423
Secure it, or it will join
that useless leg of yours.

24:28.593 --> 24:30.584
(grunts)

24:30.762 --> 24:32.468
Apologies.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.881
A question born of good will,
I assure you.

24:36.059 --> 24:38.926
Well, you can stick
your good will in your ass.

24:39.103 --> 24:42.140
What necklace
does the shit speak of?

24:42.315 --> 24:44.306
It's nothing-- best forgotten.

24:44.484 --> 24:45.690
You mad fuck.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.976
A trinket for Lucretia's pet,
wasn't it?

24:48.154 --> 24:50.145
Rest your mind.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.655
I am of no interest to Naevia.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.157
Nor her to you,

24:55.328 --> 24:57.944
if you value your cock
attached to your balls.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.829
Barca, see to Spartacus.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.991
I want him ready to fight
before the sun falls.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.830
Barca: Yes, Dominus.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.130
Rise, dog.

25:10.218 --> 25:12.209
More death awaits.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.838
(grunting)

25:37.870 --> 25:39.861
( crowd cheering )

25:40.957 --> 25:42.948
Fuck.

25:53.428 --> 25:54.918
He's finished.

26:54.614 --> 26:55.774
(screaming )

27:01.913 --> 27:03.073
( bones crack)

27:03.247 --> 27:06.489
That's how you send a dog
to the afterlife.

27:14.634 --> 27:17.296
Spartacus-- victor!

27:20.890 --> 27:23.256
- Yeah!
- ( crowd cheers )

27:40.326 --> 27:43.318
The odds soar in Spartacus's favor.
They believe he's unbeatable--

27:43.496 --> 27:45.862
a dead man whose soul refuses
to leave his body.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.122
Spartacus has no soul.

27:48.292 --> 27:51.125
lt resides in the heart of another.

27:51.295 --> 27:55.004
Prepare yourself.
You fight Mytilus next.

27:57.051 --> 27:59.337
(screaming )

28:14.360 --> 28:17.318
Crixus, you are summoned.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.295
Thank you.

28:41.012 --> 28:42.673
Wait.

28:45.266 --> 28:47.222
Domina will grow impatient.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.759
You know the urgency of her desires.

28:49.937 --> 28:52.849
She did not summon you.

28:53.024 --> 28:54.560
Then why am I here?

28:56.235 --> 28:57.850
The necklace--

28:58.029 --> 28:59.769
you purchased it for me?

28:59.947 --> 29:02.233
As I've said.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.569
Then why does it grace
the neck of Domina?

29:04.744 --> 29:07.406
( laughs)

29:07.580 --> 29:09.696
The mind of a woman.

29:09.874 --> 29:13.241
You deflect a gesture
only to question where it lands.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.250
Your words were,
"I cannot accept it."

29:15.421 --> 29:17.503
Yes, my words

29:17.673 --> 29:19.413
cut off before completion.

29:19.592 --> 29:20.923
Well, then complete.

29:21.093 --> 29:24.210
That it is impossible for me to keep it
regardless of desire.

29:24.388 --> 29:27.880
There is nothing in my possession
that was not given to me by Domina.

29:28.059 --> 29:30.801
Are you so thick that this fact
was ignored?

29:30.978 --> 29:32.934
Did you think
she would not notice?

29:34.815 --> 29:37.306
I misunderstood your meaning
in returning it.

29:37.485 --> 29:39.271
Of course you misunderstood.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.982
You have no mind outside the arena.

29:42.156 --> 29:44.112
You think only with your sword
and your shield,

29:44.283 --> 29:46.023
you stupid, lumbering--

29:54.085 --> 29:56.451
You are a fool.

29:56.629 --> 29:57.914
Guard.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.057
- ( crowd roaring )
- Man: Only one survives.

30:27.576 --> 30:30.158
Mongrel on mongrel.

30:33.165 --> 30:36.657
Spartacus-- victor.

30:36.836 --> 30:38.292
Crowd: Rip his head off!

30:44.051 --> 30:46.508
How much longer?

30:47.513 --> 30:49.799
How much blood until we're free?

30:49.974 --> 30:51.839
Soon,

30:52.018 --> 30:54.009
I promise you.

30:54.186 --> 30:57.349
Just the thought of holding you,

30:57.523 --> 31:01.732
feeling you against me--

31:01.902 --> 31:05.440
it's the only thing that keeps
my heart beating.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.696
Varro: You look like shit.

31:08.993 --> 31:12.702
l've endured worse.

31:12.872 --> 31:16.364
What man could
and still count himself of this world?

31:16.542 --> 31:18.749
Sura: This world--

31:18.919 --> 31:22.207
all it holds is suffering.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.212
It will end one day

31:27.386 --> 31:28.887
and we will be reunited.

31:29.055 --> 31:31.137
As gladiators?

31:32.266 --> 31:34.803
A welcomed thought.

31:34.977 --> 31:37.093
One that keeps me from the grasp
of the afterlife.

31:37.271 --> 31:40.934
Your condition speaks
to its encroachment.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.191
Mandrake root,

31:45.362 --> 31:47.523
acquired from Ashur,

31:47.698 --> 31:50.030
chewed to numb the pain.

31:50.201 --> 31:52.032
Take it.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.904
I can't.

31:58.918 --> 32:01.250
I need what remains of my senses
to save you.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.752
Varro: Save me from what?

32:03.923 --> 32:05.584
Spartacus.

32:10.137 --> 32:12.753
Your offer is well received,

32:12.932 --> 32:15.218
even in the turning away of it.

32:27.988 --> 32:29.774
Spartacus handsomely returns.

32:29.949 --> 32:31.735
Will the sum balance our debts?

32:31.909 --> 32:33.695
The scales are well nudged,

32:33.869 --> 32:36.281
but balanced--

32:36.455 --> 32:38.537
No.

32:40.543 --> 32:42.158
Pay out the most egregious,

32:42.336 --> 32:44.372
but leave Ovidius
with empty fucking hands.

32:44.547 --> 32:46.037
Ovidius?

32:46.215 --> 32:47.921
The magistrate's cousin?

32:48.092 --> 32:49.798
You should be in bed.
The hour is late.

32:49.969 --> 32:52.381
And our debts follow.

32:52.555 --> 32:54.546
lf money is owed to Ovidius--

32:54.723 --> 32:56.634
Batiatus: Then it will be paid
in due course.

32:56.809 --> 32:59.050
The man offered me insult.
I won't reward it with swift coin.

32:59.228 --> 33:01.935
Is that wise? If he complains
to the magistrate, I worry the result--

33:02.106 --> 33:04.813
I am the paterfamilias.
The worry is mine alone.

33:04.984 --> 33:08.021
Was that how you woke
this morning-- alone?

33:08.195 --> 33:10.732
Was I not by your side?

33:10.906 --> 33:12.862
Lucretia,

33:13.033 --> 33:15.069
how did you come to possess
those coins?

33:15.244 --> 33:16.484
Lucretia.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.531
Lucretia.

33:18.706 --> 33:20.492
From Ramel,
if you must know,

33:20.666 --> 33:22.406
In exchange for
the emerald necklace.

33:22.585 --> 33:24.166
l commanded you
to do no such thing.

33:24.336 --> 33:27.169
Commanded?
You mistake me for a slave.

33:28.966 --> 33:30.957
You know my intentions better.

33:31.135 --> 33:34.002
Lucretia, the emeralds--

33:34.180 --> 33:35.886
they looked lovely on you.

33:36.056 --> 33:38.672
To see them returned
a casualty of ill finances--

33:41.312 --> 33:43.348
in pressing the purchase
in the first place.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.514
Your worries are my worries,
Quintus.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.933
You are never alone.

33:49.111 --> 33:51.102
A notion to warm the heart.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.525
The emerald necklace--

33:57.703 --> 33:59.364
what did it bring?

34:01.207 --> 34:02.538
14 denarii.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.790
-14?
- 14.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.043
Days past it commanded twice that.

34:08.214 --> 34:11.297
Women and business--
and these are the results.

34:11.467 --> 34:14.584
An offer for the full price was made
by Solonius who happened by.

34:14.762 --> 34:17.219
Better business had I accepted?

34:19.391 --> 34:21.973
You struck the wiser bargain.

34:22.144 --> 34:24.726
Solonius knows of your activities
in the pits.

34:24.897 --> 34:27.104
- The whole city does by now.
- Let their tongues wag.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.139
The winnings will return this ludus
to solvency.

34:29.318 --> 34:32.060
Then we'll have at Solonius
and all his shit-eaters.

34:32.238 --> 34:34.229
How long can the Thracian last?

34:34.406 --> 34:37.364
A handful of nights, if that.

34:37.534 --> 34:42.369
Even the walking dead
eventually return to the grave.

34:47.044 --> 34:50.536
( gate rattles )

34:51.590 --> 34:53.751
( men clamoring )

34:53.926 --> 34:56.292
Man: Send him back to the pits.

34:56.470 --> 34:58.756
Man #2: He's not a fucking gladiator.

34:58.931 --> 35:01.422
- Spartacus.
- Man #3: I'll fuck him up.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.763
Here, take it, Spartacus.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.185
You have fought well, Spartacus.

35:17.408 --> 35:19.444
The gods reward you.

35:24.581 --> 35:26.412
The promise is kept.

35:41.265 --> 35:43.176
Sura.

35:51.942 --> 35:55.855
I will always be with you,

35:56.030 --> 35:58.021
even in death.

35:59.992 --> 36:02.483
The rains are coming.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.778
Save me
before they wash everything away.

36:05.956 --> 36:07.332
Sura.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.456
No.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.170
No!

36:39.698 --> 36:42.815
Ashur: Not so much fight
in him now, is there?

36:44.661 --> 36:47.368
He saves his fury for the pits--

36:47.539 --> 36:50.497
a place you wouldn't last
a fucking breath.

36:51.668 --> 36:54.330
Spartacus,

36:54.505 --> 36:56.791
you've fought well.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.501
The gods may yet reward you.

36:58.675 --> 37:00.666
The gods--

37:00.844 --> 37:03.005
they came to me last night

37:03.180 --> 37:04.340
in a dream.

37:04.515 --> 37:05.880
What did they show you?

37:06.058 --> 37:08.094
The truth.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.395
Your profit from my blood
ends tonight.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.725
Refuse to fight, and I will cease
my attempts to find your wife.

37:15.067 --> 37:18.559
l have to save her

37:18.737 --> 37:21.149
before the rains come.

37:22.324 --> 37:24.189
Give way to your meaning,

37:24.368 --> 37:26.404
you mad fuck.

37:30.374 --> 37:32.990
The odds remain high in my favor?

37:34.044 --> 37:35.705
Still.

37:35.879 --> 37:38.256
Then bet everything you have
against me.

37:39.425 --> 37:42.588
You would die in the pits willingly,
to see my fortune rise?

37:42.761 --> 37:44.501
Yes,

37:44.680 --> 37:48.264
if you will hold to wrest my wife
from the Syrian with a piece of it.

37:49.351 --> 37:52.718
What's to keep me to this bargain
once your blood is spilled?

37:52.896 --> 37:55.057
Honor

37:55.232 --> 37:58.941
and the promise of vengeance
from the afterlife if you betray it.

38:03.407 --> 38:05.238
The deal is struck.

38:05.409 --> 38:08.572
Make it appear a sincere fight.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.536
Finish preparing him.

38:51.330 --> 38:53.321
Behold

38:53.499 --> 38:54.989
Spartacus.

38:58.879 --> 39:01.040
Behold lxion.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.843
The wager is placed?

39:09.014 --> 39:12.051
The sum has been spread
among the brokers to ease suspicion.

39:12.226 --> 39:13.966
What weapons

39:14.144 --> 39:16.009
shall the gods bless them with?

39:16.188 --> 39:19.931
Or curse them with empty hands?

39:25.405 --> 39:29.239
lxion draws bipennis.

39:40.712 --> 39:44.455
Spartacus draws sica.

39:50.556 --> 39:55.016
We have but a single rule--

39:55.185 --> 39:57.722
only one survives;

39:57.896 --> 40:01.229
mongrel on mongrel

40:01.400 --> 40:04.392
till Charon arrives.

40:36.977 --> 40:38.763
( screams )

41:19.269 --> 41:22.761
Not yet, not yet.

41:28.111 --> 41:29.647
You loser.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.335
No!

42:52.237 --> 42:54.478
My protector,
and here I stand bloodied.

42:54.656 --> 42:56.237
I did not see there was another.

42:56.408 --> 42:58.615
Batiatus: You must see all
when my life is in the balance.

42:58.785 --> 43:00.946
Ring your crown with eyes
or have the two you possess

43:01.121 --> 43:02.531
ripped from your fucking skull.

43:02.706 --> 43:04.913
Their flesh carries a brand, Dominus.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.243
Of what origin?

43:06.418 --> 43:07.908
Unfamiliar,

43:08.086 --> 43:10.793
but certainly the mark of a slave.

43:10.964 --> 43:13.956
Slaves?

43:14.134 --> 43:17.922
They send common fucking slaves

43:18.096 --> 43:20.633
to kill Batiatus?

43:20.807 --> 43:23.423
Common fucking slaves?

43:23.602 --> 43:25.092
Fuck.

43:28.148 --> 43:30.605
Fuck.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.609
Discover their master.

43:36.656 --> 43:38.612
| wish to have words with him.

43:46.249 --> 43:47.955
Juno's lips,

43:48.126 --> 43:50.412
Juno's heart,

43:50.587 --> 43:52.452
Juno's belly.

43:56.843 --> 43:59.300
The Kalends are upon us,

43:59.471 --> 44:01.678
the first day of the new month.

44:01.848 --> 44:04.180
Batiatus: Prepare a sacrifice.

44:04.351 --> 44:06.842
Perhaps the gods will finally grace us
with a child in return.

44:07.020 --> 44:08.726
( groans )

44:08.897 --> 44:10.433
Quintus.

44:10.607 --> 44:12.347
It's nothing, a minor annoyance.

44:12.526 --> 44:14.062
Minor?

44:14.236 --> 44:17.148
Why do you speak of children,
yet press to make me a widow?

44:17.322 --> 44:20.405
It would take more than a scratch
to wrest me from your side.

44:20.575 --> 44:22.076
Barely more. Sit.

44:24.329 --> 44:26.741
And tell me
who must die in response.

44:27.749 --> 44:30.331
The agents have already been
dispatched to the underworld,

44:30.502 --> 44:34.040
the hand behind them
yet to be revealed.

44:34.214 --> 44:37.047
I warned you of the dangers
of the pits.

44:37.217 --> 44:41.586
I had thought to erase all our debts
through them after tonight.

44:41.763 --> 44:44.004
Spartacus offered terms to see it so.

44:44.182 --> 44:46.173
What terms?

44:46.351 --> 44:48.012
His willing death
to wager upon,

44:48.186 --> 44:50.051
locating his wife
the crux of the bargain.

44:50.230 --> 44:53.768
The Thracian is dead?

44:53.942 --> 44:56.524
No, he yet lives.

44:58.697 --> 45:00.437
And the wager is lost.

45:00.615 --> 45:01.946
How much?

45:03.451 --> 45:04.531
A substantial sum.

45:04.703 --> 45:08.195
We don't have it.

45:08.373 --> 45:10.409
That Thracian--

45:10.584 --> 45:12.700
he brings nothing but shame
on our house.

45:12.878 --> 45:14.743
Were it not for him,

45:14.921 --> 45:16.877
you would be a widow.

45:17.048 --> 45:19.460
He saved my life in the pits
this night.

45:19.634 --> 45:23.047
A place that you would never have been
if it weren't for him.

45:23.221 --> 45:26.713
He's cursed.
He's cursed by the gods.

45:26.892 --> 45:29.554
And I would see his life ended
as it should have been

45:29.728 --> 45:32.470
when he stepped into the arena,
doomed for execution.

45:32.647 --> 45:35.184
Every day that the Thracian
yet lives,

45:35.358 --> 45:38.065
I fear that his curse
becomes our own.

45:51.875 --> 45:54.412
Spartacus.

45:56.755 --> 45:59.167
Batiatus summons you.

46:16.274 --> 46:19.357
My wife thinks you are cursed
by the gods.

46:19.527 --> 46:22.018
I'm inclined to agree.

46:22.197 --> 46:24.779
You'll find no argument.

46:24.950 --> 46:27.066
The rational course would be
to end your miserable life

46:27.243 --> 46:29.404
before it further infects mine.

46:29.579 --> 46:32.912
A promise was made
you would find Sura.

46:33.083 --> 46:35.620
If you died in the pits.

46:35.794 --> 46:37.580
Yet here you stand, alive.

46:37.754 --> 46:39.460
As do you.

46:45.637 --> 46:48.253
The promise is kept.

46:48.431 --> 46:50.171
I will continue the search for her.

46:53.812 --> 46:55.803
You saved my life.

46:55.981 --> 46:57.642
Gods or not,

46:57.816 --> 47:00.649
a debt demands repayment.

47:02.654 --> 47:05.396
He's to rejoin the gladiators
as soon as he is able.

47:18.294 --> 47:18.453
(theme music playing )

47:18.461 --> 47:20.622
(theme music playing )
