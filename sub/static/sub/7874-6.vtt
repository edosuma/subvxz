WEBVTT

00:34.134 --> 00:36.969
- Mmm.
- I,m so glad you came over for dinner, Debbie.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.970
Yes, terrific to have my son's girlfriend
gobbling up my family's precious food.

00:41.374 --> 00:44.374
Everything's so delicious.
Mr. Smith, can you pass the potatoes?

00:45.345 --> 00:47.579
Ethically,
I don't think I should.

00:47.580 --> 00:50.580
Mashed spuds for milady?

00:51.251 --> 00:53.852
It's so nice
having you over, Debbie.

00:53.853 --> 00:55.954
Oh, honey, here.
Let me do that.

00:55.955 --> 00:58.390
Mom, I can cut my own steak.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.392
Oh, Debbie doesn't care.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.761
I,m your mom.
That's what moms do.

01:02.762 --> 01:05.762
Now open up.
Bernie Bee wants to find his flower.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.733
Is this his flower?

01:12.505 --> 01:15.505
Ah, come on, Debbie. Let's go swab
the steak sauce out of my ear.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.912
It's so cute that Steve
has a little girlfriend.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.014
Well, don't tell Debbie about
her because she,ll eat her.

01:22.015 --> 01:25.015
Is the coast clear?
Good, I can join.

01:25.318 --> 01:27.886
I found this old New Yorker
in the bathroom...

01:27.887 --> 01:30.756
and there's a very interesting
take on T.S. Eliot's work.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.592
- It seems that-
- What does Steve see in Debbie?

01:33.593 --> 01:35.594
Maybe he's just gonna
turn her into condos.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.263
- Uh, excuse me.
- What? Were you saying something?

01:38.264 --> 01:40.432
Spit out your cutesy quip
and shovel on.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.835
Is Roger doing a bit?
Roger, start over.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.903
I was making a serious point.

01:44.904 --> 01:47.904
- Oh.
- Why does nobody respect me?

01:48.041 --> 01:50.442
Roger, you,re
an uneducated alcoholic.

01:50.443 --> 01:53.345
You don't know anything except
Qv.C. return policies.

01:53.346 --> 01:56.346
That's a specialty, yes.
But I have a lot of smart opinions.

01:56.549 --> 01:59.184
Can it! You,re the Adam Sandler
of this house.

01:59.185 --> 02:02.185
And nobody wants Punch-Drunk Love.
Just give us Water boy

02:02.288 --> 02:05.288
You ignorant cretins.
I,m more than just a clown.

02:11.231 --> 02:14.231
There we go. Dumb alien.
That's good material.

02:18.238 --> 02:21.238
You should be nicer to Debbie.
If my Stevie likes her-

02:21.808 --> 02:23.942
Ah, Stan, that's too tight.

02:23.943 --> 02:26.943
I know you don't want any more kids,
but do we have to go to these lengths?

02:27.480 --> 02:29.481
I don't like it
any more than you do.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.017
But just think,
soon we,ll be able to mate worry free.

02:32.018 --> 02:34.019
You know,
because you,ll be menopausal.

02:34.020 --> 02:37.020
Your uterus will fall like Saigon.
And Steve was the last chopper out.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.492
Oh, I,ll always have my little Stevie.

02:40.493 --> 02:43.493
Condoms, diaphragm,
can of sperm repellent.

02:43.730 --> 02:46.730
All right. Foreplay.

02:53.773 --> 02:56.773
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Smith.
Is Steve ready to walk to school?

02:56.876 --> 02:59.711
Oh, Debbie, look,
this is my breakfast.

02:59.712 --> 03:01.713
Steve will be
right down, honey.

03:01.714 --> 03:04.049
Be nice.

03:04.050 --> 03:07.050
- Just so we,re clear.
- Is that a Tec P11 nine millimeter?

03:07.854 --> 03:09.955
You-You know about guns?

03:09.956 --> 03:12.591
Yeah, I use my dad's
to shoot the eyes out of squirrels.

03:12.592 --> 03:15.592
Good God!
That's a tough shot!

03:15.995 --> 03:18.995
- Your sight needs a tweak. May I?
- Please.

03:19.165 --> 03:22.165
You know,
you,re all right, big stuff.

03:22.335 --> 03:25.037
- Hey, Debs.
- You kids have a good day at school.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.406
Here's your lunch, Steve.

03:27.407 --> 03:30.407
- Oh, that's okay, Mom. Debbie took care of it.
- I,m sorry. What?

03:31.277 --> 03:34.277
- Yeah. I made Steve's lunch today.
- But that's impossible.

03:35.348 --> 03:38.348
Cucumber sandwich!
Tight!

03:39.586 --> 03:42.254
You know, cucumbers
are just brineless pickles.

03:42.255 --> 03:44.256
I could,ve
"de-brined... his pickles.

03:44.257 --> 03:46.692
Who does that fatso
think she is?

03:46.693 --> 03:49.693
Oh, is Debbie a larger woman?
I hadn't noticed.

03:51.264 --> 03:54.264
I can't wait to enroll here.
People are finally gonna take me seriously.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.603
Don't they have college
on your planet?

03:57.604 --> 04:00.239
Yeah, but if you,re not Asian,
it's impossible to get in.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.641
Hey, Ethan.

04:02.642 --> 04:04.710
God, Ethan is so hot.

04:04.711 --> 04:07.711
And he completely ignores me.
It makes him so much hotter.

04:07.814 --> 04:10.814
What are you talking about? He totally
ignored me and I don't think he's hot at a-

04:11.651 --> 04:14.651
Now I see it.
Now I,m seeing it.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.725
Oh, what do you have
there, honey?

04:19.726 --> 04:21.726
I,m making a scrapbook
of me and Debbie.

04:21.728 --> 04:24.728
Let me move these flowers
so you have more light.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.199
Mom!

04:27.200 --> 04:30.135
Oh, I,m sure
that,ll come right out.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.375
There. She's gone.

04:36.376 --> 04:39.376
I mean the stain.
I call the stain a "she... like a ship.

04:41.047 --> 04:43.949
Anyway, it's been a while,
so I was thinking tonight...

04:43.950 --> 04:46.485
we could see who can do
the best pretend elephant.

04:48.488 --> 04:51.488
- Beat that.
- Actually, I,m going over to Debbie's tonight.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.458
Oh, um, Steve,
Mommy's not feeling well.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.462
Oh, I,m sorry to hear that.

04:59.699 --> 05:02.699
- Mommy's dying!
- You,re funny.

05:02.935 --> 05:05.935
Not as funny as Debbie.
She cracks me up.

05:05.938 --> 05:08.938
Debbie.

05:12.245 --> 05:15.245
Francine. What are you doing here?
This isn't home.

05:15.381 --> 05:18.381
Well, I just wanted to bring you and the boys
some cookies. Is that a dead squirrel?

05:19.986 --> 05:22.321
Yeah, Debbie
made me a desk caddy.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.322
Look, I can sharpen
my pencil. Great gal.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.693
Plus, she's fast-tracking
our boy to manhood.

05:27.694 --> 05:30.694
Yeah. So I,d like to reward
the guys fighting the drug war.

05:32.298 --> 05:34.299
Where's the drug room?

05:34.300 --> 05:37.300
I don't have any drugs.
I,m totally clean.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.638
Do you expect me
to take your word...

05:39.639 --> 05:42.574
over that of an anonymous tipster?

05:46.179 --> 05:49.179
Pure Peruvian marching powder,
grown on the Andes, north slope.

05:50.416 --> 05:52.918
I,d say it's about
80% baby laxative.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.919
Yep, this junk
means only one thing.

05:56.556 --> 05:59.458
Esteban Mortia
is back in business.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.960
Principal Lewis,
those drugs aren't mine.

06:01.961 --> 06:04.396
Then explain this.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.397
Smith, you,re suspended.

06:07.633 --> 06:10.633
And tell Esteban that ellobonegron
sends his regards.

06:16.843 --> 06:19.843
Hey, Ethan. Don't you love literature?
It's so uninhibited.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.949
Like me after
a couple of beers.

06:23.950 --> 06:26.184
- Hmm.
- Good afternoon, everyone.

06:26.185 --> 06:29.185
I,m Professor Guggenheim.

06:29.422 --> 06:32.422
Wait. Is there another "G...?
Or is it-

06:32.825 --> 06:35.825
I,m Professor Baxter. And you,ll be
respecting me this semester.

06:36.562 --> 06:39.562
- What are you doing?
- I went to talk to the dean. One lie led to another...

06:39.966 --> 06:41.967
and he asked me
to teach this class.

06:41.968 --> 06:44.102
- You can't teach.
- Quiet, please.

06:44.103 --> 06:46.905
You may have thought
this class was about literature.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.408
You were wrong.
This class is about life.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.283
My office hours.
They,re Tuesday from 1:00 to 3:00.

07:03.489 --> 07:05.991
Steve, you were right
to call Mommy.

07:05.992 --> 07:08.026
Don't worry about
being suspended.

07:08.027 --> 07:10.429
From now on,
you,ll just stay home with me.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.131
- I know you set me up, Mother.
- What?

07:13.132 --> 07:16.132
We can't keep doing this. It isn't working,
you and me. We,ve grown apart.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.771
Oh, God. The crowded restaurant
so I wouldn't make a scene.

07:22.141 --> 07:24.142
You,re breaking up with me.

07:24.143 --> 07:27.143
We had a good run.
Remember my fifth birthday? Oh.

07:27.713 --> 07:29.881
And I had some
great times suckling.

07:29.882 --> 07:32.882
- But it's time to move on.
- This isn't happening.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.188
You,ll find someone new.
Maybe you,ll get some cats.

07:36.189 --> 07:39.189
- This is all Debbie's fault.
- Let's be adults about this, Mom.

07:40.092 --> 07:42.928
I,d- I,d like the key
to my bike lock.

07:42.929 --> 07:45.929
- Just take it!
- We,ll see each other around the house.

07:46.866 --> 07:49.866
- And we,ll still be friends.
- Oh, sure, friends!

07:50.069 --> 07:53.069
I don't need any more friends, Steven.

07:54.273 --> 07:57.042
- Can I take your order, honey?
- Oh, hey, Gladys.

07:57.043 --> 08:00.043
I, uh-Yeah, I wanted
to talk to you too.

08:00.913 --> 08:03.913
There's another coffee shop.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.929
I used to watch
this show with Steve.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.930
But now he's left me.
And look how old Maria's gotten.

08:22.101 --> 08:24.736
Francine, why not
just replace Steve?

08:24.737 --> 08:26.738
You know,
have another baby.

08:26.739 --> 08:29.739
Stan would never go for another kid.
His mind is made up.

08:30.409 --> 08:33.409
It's not his mind you need.

08:37.082 --> 08:39.951
What the-
Rape! Succubus!

08:39.952 --> 08:42.921
- Ow!
- Francine, what are you doing?

08:42.922 --> 08:44.890
I was being spontaneous.

08:44.891 --> 08:47.659
Look at the calendar.
This isn't one of our safe days.

08:47.660 --> 08:50.395
That means there's something else
going on in your woman theater.

08:50.396 --> 08:52.697
And I do not perform
with another act.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.699
Stan, I,ve been thinking.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.935
Maybe it would be okay
if we had another baby.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.504
Are you mad, woman?
Once the kids are out of the house...

08:59.505 --> 09:02.240
you,ll lead the carefree life
of a barren spinster.

09:02.241 --> 09:05.241
Except your nights will be filled
with unsheathed, unwrapped pounding.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.446
Stan, I want another baby.

09:08.447 --> 09:11.447
Forget it. You,ll stay off my man zone
until you,re in hot flashes.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.386
You better sleep
with one eye open, Stan.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.387
I,ll do whatever it takes.

09:17.957 --> 09:19.958
Whatever it takes.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.561
Huh, that doesn't hurt half as bad
as I thought-

09:22.562 --> 09:24.563
Quick, wipe it off
between your legs!

09:24.564 --> 09:27.564
No, wait! Nice try.

09:29.168 --> 09:31.770
You must plunge into the pool of life.

09:31.771 --> 09:34.771
But ask yourself,
will you jackknife or cannonball?

09:35.474 --> 09:38.474
- Wow, he's so smart.
- I just ate. I,m gonna wait 30 minutes.

09:39.145 --> 09:42.113
Did you see that, Hayley?
They respect me.

09:42.114 --> 09:45.114
Roger, your lecture today was
just a bunch of idealistic nonsense.

09:45.785 --> 09:48.785
Oh, really? You just earned
yourself a week of detention.

09:49.221 --> 09:52.221
- There's no detention in college.
- Oh, right.

09:52.725 --> 09:55.660
Well, then I,m taking away
50 points from Gryffindor.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.263
Oh, sorry.
I,m- I,m interrupting.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.765
No,just a lively
exchange of ideas.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.766
I- I just wanted to tell you
how inspiring you are, Professor.

10:04.503 --> 10:06.671
It's like I,ve been
asleep my whole life.

10:06.672 --> 10:09.672
- And now I,m finally awake.
- Oh, I,m awake too. Totally awake.

10:09.909 --> 10:12.444
- It's like I,m on crank, I,m so awake.
- Exactly.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.446
You wanna get some coffee...

10:14.447 --> 10:17.447
- and talk about Professor Baxter's ideas?
- Sounds great.

10:17.717 --> 10:20.717
Later, Professor.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.622
I pretend to teach them.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.623
But it's really they
who pretend to teach me.

10:36.736 --> 10:39.736
Welcome to
vasectech vasectomy Systems.

10:40.139 --> 10:43.139
If you have a coupon,
insert it now.

10:47.246 --> 10:49.914
- I,m Kichiro.
- And I,m Mojiro.

10:49.915 --> 10:52.915
Your vasectomy
is about to beginning.

10:53.152 --> 10:56.152
Imagine: Empty playgrounds,
free of children shouting and laughter.

10:57.556 --> 11:00.425
That's the beautiful
dream of vasectech.

11:00.426 --> 11:03.426
After this simple procedure, you will be
unsuitable towards manufacture children.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.033
Yea!

11:08.034 --> 11:11.034
A world with no children.
Future generations will thank us.

11:12.271 --> 11:15.140
vasectomy is
the serious procedure.

11:15.141 --> 11:17.308
Would you like to save
some father fluids?

11:17.309 --> 11:20.309
Please fill cup
our attendant provides.

11:20.446 --> 11:23.446
Please use good-time magazines.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.318
No need. I already
banked plenty of sperm...

11:27.319 --> 11:29.688
before a dangerous mission
back in the,80s.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.689
There's a vial of proto-Smiths at the
government storage center outside D.C.-

11:33.626 --> 11:36.626
strong, Reagan-era swimmers inspired by
the 1984 Olympic victories of Matt Biondi.

11:38.798 --> 11:41.798
Oh, congratulations on superior depositing.

11:44.804 --> 11:47.804
Kindly enter for your vasectomy.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.575
So where do I put my- Oh, I see.

11:50.576 --> 11:53.576
Wow, that's a snug fit.

11:55.514 --> 11:58.514
There's a simple lesson
to be learned from...

11:58.651 --> 12:01.186
whatever book I,m teaching
you about, and it's this:

12:01.187 --> 12:04.187
Follow your heart and get rid of anything
that stands in the way of your dreams.

12:08.694 --> 12:11.062
All right. Assignment, people.

12:11.063 --> 12:14.063
Buy Moby Dick and
tear it up... by Monday.

12:14.433 --> 12:17.433
I know some of you aren't ripping up
your homework like I ask.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.472
Don't complain to me when
you can't rip up your midterm.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.474
Roger, how did you
come up with that lecture?

12:22.475 --> 12:25.043
Oh, I just stitched together
a little Mr. Holland..

12:25.044 --> 12:27.445
a little Dead Poets
and the rest is just lies.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.447
Well, keep up that
"follow your heart... crap.

12:29.448 --> 12:31.449
I think Ethan's
really loosening up.

12:31.450 --> 12:34.450
Professor, I was wondering if you,d like
to come to dinner at my home.

12:35.187 --> 12:37.922
Hayley, you should join us too.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.058
Hayley,just so we,re clear,
you,re only coming...

12:40.059 --> 12:43.059
because you got caught
in the gravity of my invite.

12:43.329 --> 12:46.329
I was so invited that it invited
everything around it.

12:48.567 --> 12:51.302
Oh, Debbie.

12:51.303 --> 12:53.805
Oh, uh, hey.

12:53.806 --> 12:56.374
- Didn't expect to see you here.
- The kitchen?

12:56.375 --> 12:59.110
Look, I really don't wanna
get into this right now.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.346
Come on, Debbie.

13:01.347 --> 13:04.315
You, um-
You look good.

13:04.316 --> 13:06.384
Say hi to your folks for me.

13:06.385 --> 13:08.753
She looks awful.

13:08.754 --> 13:11.523
Francine, I thought about what you said
about having a baby.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.524
You,re right and I,m wrong, and there
is nothing suspicious about that.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.527
Oh, Stan.

13:45.257 --> 13:48.059
Still no baby.
I don't understand.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.395
I guess we just
need to keep trying.

13:50.396 --> 13:52.697
That's the spirit, soldier.
Tell you what.

13:52.698 --> 13:55.433
I,m gonna take a shower,
then we,ll recharge with frozen yogurt.

13:55.434 --> 13:57.268
Oh, I think we have a coupon.

13:57.269 --> 14:00.269
There you go.
Now you,re holding up your end.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.875
Let's see. Y's.

14:06.045 --> 14:09.045
vasectomy?

14:11.684 --> 14:14.319
Professor, Hayley.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.320
- Shrimp Gruyere puff?
- Mmm.

14:18.324 --> 14:21.324
Oh, Ethan, you should be
a professor of food.

14:23.229 --> 14:26.229
Thanks. I,ve always wanted to cook,
but my father never supported me.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.634
But now you,ve inspired me.

14:29.635 --> 14:32.635
That's why I became a professor,
Ethan, to inspire people-

14:33.305 --> 14:35.640
inspire them to respect me.

14:35.641 --> 14:38.641
Oh, and you know how you told us
to make a change for the better?

14:39.612 --> 14:42.612
Well, I took your advice
and stabbed my father 38 times.

14:48.387 --> 14:51.387
Daddy, Daddy.

14:55.594 --> 14:58.594
Not eating isn't
gonna bring him back.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.634
Hey after yogurt, let's try
the reverse bulldog again.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.503
- I think you just need to punch me harder.
- You had a vasectomy?

15:05.504 --> 15:08.504
Look, I know you,re mad, but I,m sliced.
There's nothing we can do.

15:09.174 --> 15:11.342
How about some
angry, no-baby sex?

15:11.343 --> 15:13.578
Oh, there's
something I can do.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.579
Your Japanese friends told me
about your banked sperm.

15:16.815 --> 15:19.815
- Kichiro.
- I know about the government storage center, Stan.

15:21.220 --> 15:24.220
- I,m having a baby.
- No! My eyes!

15:26.158 --> 15:29.158
My mouth! My back!

15:29.295 --> 15:31.496
My begonia!

15:31.497 --> 15:33.631
"My Sharona...!

15:33.632 --> 15:36.632
- Marry me.
- My Best Friend's Wedding!Ah, my eyes again!

15:46.078 --> 15:49.078
- Francine, stop this.
- If you won't give me a baby, I,m gonna get one myself.

16:09.268 --> 16:12.036
Roger, tell him we want
to get the hell out of here.

16:12.037 --> 16:14.205
Uh, Ethan, it's been
a lovely evening...

16:14.206 --> 16:16.207
but I have a faculty
meeting in the morning.

16:16.208 --> 16:19.208
No, you can't leave.
We need to seize the day like you said.

16:19.611 --> 16:22.611
And if we don't, then life
isn't worth living... for any of us.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.883
I,ll go get Pictionary.

16:25.884 --> 16:28.884
Let's just make a run for it.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.822
Finally, my ear popped.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.261
Why aren't these labeled?

16:37.262 --> 16:39.263
I won't know
whose sperm I,m getting.

16:39.264 --> 16:41.299
It's like I,m blacked out
at a frat house.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.034
Give it up, Francine.

16:43.035 --> 16:46.035
Ever since I first became a father,
I,ve dreamed of being done with kids.

16:46.205 --> 16:48.206
And I won't let you ruin that.

16:48.207 --> 16:51.207
Well, I am not gonna let my husband
stand in the way of me getting pregnant.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.747
You missed!

16:55.748 --> 16:58.748
Oh, I didn't miss.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.018
Oh, sweet, merciful heaven.

17:04.156 --> 17:07.156
I feel like Tara Reid
on an average Tuesday.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.960
Wait a second.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.865
Milk! Well, that's
much less disgusting.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.973
Let's see. "S....

17:25.210 --> 17:27.811
"Reagan, Rove, Rumsfeld....

17:27.813 --> 17:30.813
"Reno...?Janet Reno?
That goes over here.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.817
Looking for this?

17:32.818 --> 17:35.818
Remember me, fellas? I,m sure
you,d all make fine Stan Juniors.

17:37.022 --> 17:40.022
But I can't be running around and making you
grilled cheese for the next 18 years.

17:41.026 --> 17:44.026
Stan, don't!
I,ve got a turkey baster and...

17:45.364 --> 17:47.498
George Stephanopoulos.

17:47.499 --> 17:50.401
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, I would.

17:50.402 --> 17:53.402
You want that, Stan? A house
full of liberal Greek midget babies.

17:54.940 --> 17:57.940
Francine, he has the third-rated Sunday
talk show. He loses to Bob Schieffer.

17:59.178 --> 18:02.178
I don't care.
I wanna be a mom again.

18:02.514 --> 18:04.682
All right, all right. You win.

18:04.683 --> 18:07.351
Here. Take my baby gravy.

18:07.352 --> 18:10.352
But you don't need it, Francine.
You,re already a mother.

18:10.689 --> 18:13.391
And you always will be. Look.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.597
Kids are supposed to leave you.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.599
It means you did a great job.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.601
It means you prepared them
for the world.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.602
I just thought
you should know that.

18:29.541 --> 18:32.541
Why am I doing this?
I am a mother, a great mother.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.981
And our kids are the proof.

18:36.982 --> 18:39.982
Oh, Stan.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.787
I- Is it a car? Uh, some kind of car?

18:45.524 --> 18:48.524
- Please, God. Let it be a car.
- Uh-Uh, a truck, a fan, a car.

18:50.229 --> 18:53.229
I don't know what it is!

18:54.032 --> 18:56.834
It was a boat.
We,re not seizing the day at all.

18:56.835 --> 18:59.835
Uh- Uh, you know what would
really be seizing the moment?

19:00.372 --> 19:03.241
If you and Hayley made out
in the closet next to a dead guy.

19:03.242 --> 19:06.242
Yeah, that would be great.
It's like life and death or something.

19:07.379 --> 19:10.379
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry. I totally have a plan to get me out of here.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.651
You know what would be
even better, Ethan?

19:13.652 --> 19:16.652
If you went into the closet with
Professor Baxter and talked about ideas.

19:16.955 --> 19:19.891
- Oh, that is better.
- No, no, no, it's not any better.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.892
- I-I don't have any ideas. I,m not even
a real professor. - What? You,re not?

19:25.164 --> 19:28.164
No.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.400
Ethan, I wanted people to think
I was smart. But I,m an idiot.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.838
I looked up to you.
I- I listened to your every word.

19:36.642 --> 19:38.976
Huge mistake.
very bad idea.

19:38.977 --> 19:41.977
I,m just a clumsy oaf who likes
to nap, eat Nutter Butters...

19:42.181 --> 19:44.348
and watch bad television.

19:44.349 --> 19:47.285
And you know what?
That's what I,m best at.

19:47.286 --> 19:50.286
I don't need respect. You know,
I,m gonna quit trying to do The Majestic...

19:50.556 --> 19:53.556
and just go back to Ace Ventura.

19:54.159 --> 19:57.159
I killed my dad because of you.

19:57.296 --> 19:59.530
Hey, guy. Don't be down.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.532
I know it looks rough
right now, but-

20:01.533 --> 20:03.534
Oh, what's this?

20:03.535 --> 20:05.536
Is this a nickel?

20:05.537 --> 20:08.537
Here. You keep that.
So we,re gonna go.

20:08.674 --> 20:11.542
Uh, you,ll probably wanna put your pants on
for when the police come.

20:11.543 --> 20:14.111
I believe they,re still in the microwave.

20:14.112 --> 20:17.112
Oh, and Hayley thinks
you,re totally cute.

20:23.388 --> 20:26.388
- Mom, you,re home.
- Oh, Stevie. What's the matter?

20:27.392 --> 20:29.727
Debbie broke up with me.

20:29.728 --> 20:32.129
Oh, Steve.
Mommy's here, honey.

20:32.130 --> 20:35.130
Francine,
remember the cow.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.867
Steve, you,re a big boy.
You,re gonna be fine.

20:41.773 --> 20:44.075
Oh, Steve,
come back to Mommy.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.110
- I,m all you have.
- What?

20:46.111 --> 20:49.111
Well, no girl will ever
love you as much as Mommy.

20:49.548 --> 20:52.548
- They-They won't?
- Oh, heavens, no.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.553
Even Debbie didn't
find you attractive.

20:55.554 --> 20:58.554
- She didn't?
- No, not even a little.

20:58.857 --> 21:00.858
As a woman, I could tell.

21:00.859 --> 21:03.859
Mama.

21:04.363 --> 21:07.363
That's okay. You can stay
right here at home...

21:08.433 --> 21:11.433
with Mommy... forever.
