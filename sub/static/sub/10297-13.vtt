[PEG EXHALES]

01:22.701 --> 01:23.834
Hmm.

01:23.834 --> 01:27.100
"Cher to wed 21-year-old alien."

01:27.100 --> 01:29.067
Well, good for her!

01:29.067 --> 01:30.200
Hey, Peg.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.400
Oh, good.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.701
I caught you
on a break.

01:34.701 --> 01:36.000
Listen.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.033
Last night I saw a bright star
shining in the East.

01:39.033 --> 01:40.167
Peg...

01:40.167 --> 01:42.767
Did you do our laundry?

01:42.767 --> 01:44.567
I had to.

01:44.567 --> 01:46.367
One of your shirts
reached out of the hamper,

01:46.367 --> 01:48.100
grabbed me around the windpipe,

01:48.100 --> 01:51.133
and demanded
to be taken to the airport.

01:51.133 --> 01:52.467
Stupid shirt.

01:52.467 --> 01:54.667
If it was that easy,
I would've been gone years ago.

01:54.667 --> 01:56.033
Now, look, Peg.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.133
Two months ago, I bought
20 pair of socks.

01:58.133 --> 01:59.834
Now I got
20 swinging singles

01:59.834 --> 02:03.367
with only
one complete pair.

02:03.367 --> 02:04.634
Then wear them.

02:04.634 --> 02:05.868
I can't.

02:05.868 --> 02:08.234
They're the socks
I got married in.

02:08.234 --> 02:13.300
The evil socks.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.100
What are you doing
with my socks, Peg?

02:15.100 --> 02:18.434
I didn't want to tell you
because I knew you'd get upset,

02:18.434 --> 02:21.467
but I traded your socks
and the family cow

02:21.467 --> 02:23.400
for these magic beans.

02:25.334 --> 02:26.767
Something's going on here, Peg.

02:26.767 --> 02:29.000
Something dark, something deep,
something sinister,

02:29.000 --> 02:31.167
so I know a woman's behind it.

02:31.167 --> 02:32.367
Now, I called all my friends,

02:32.367 --> 02:33.634
and their socks
are disappearing too,

02:33.634 --> 02:37.501
and their wives
claim they don't know either.

02:37.501 --> 02:39.367
So level with me, Peg.

02:39.367 --> 02:45.100
What is Oprah telling you
to do with our socks?

02:45.100 --> 02:47.701
Or was it Geraldo?

02:47.701 --> 02:49.567
Sell a shoe, Al.

02:50.801 --> 02:52.501
Fine,
but I'll be watching you.

02:53.801 --> 02:55.801
Mom, Dad, big news
at school today.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.367
All the guys
are losing their socks

02:57.367 --> 03:00.701
while the girls in Home Ec
giggle fiendishly?

03:00.701 --> 03:03.934
Mom, big news in school today.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.634
The tap-dancing club was doing
a recital in the ghetto.

03:06.634 --> 03:08.634
Now, apparently, all the gangs
banded together

03:08.634 --> 03:10.100
and attacked their bus.

03:10.100 --> 03:12.400
They couldn't figure out why,
but it seems that someone

03:12.400 --> 03:14.667
spray-painted a slogan on
the side of the bus that said,

03:14.667 --> 03:19.801
"We may be nerds, but at least
we're not poor. Ha ha."

03:19.801 --> 03:21.968
That's terrible.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.567
Who would do
a mean thing like that?

03:23.567 --> 03:25.634
I'll give you a hint.

03:25.634 --> 03:27.334
She lives here,

03:27.334 --> 03:29.467
has white hair,

03:29.467 --> 03:31.868
and misspelled "ha ha."

03:35.267 --> 03:37.367
Oh, no.
Not what's-her-name.

03:37.367 --> 03:39.033
It's Kelly, Al.

03:39.033 --> 03:41.467
Yeah, that's the one.

03:41.467 --> 03:44.667
Our spelling bee winner
should be here any second.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.734
Dad, please,
go easy on her.

03:46.734 --> 03:47.901
I'll get your belt.

03:51.767 --> 03:52.834
Hi, everybody.

03:52.834 --> 03:54.000
Hi, Kelly.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.067
Anything interesting
happen at school today?

03:56.067 --> 03:57.734
Oh, not to me.

03:57.734 --> 03:58.634
Well, good night.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.601
Kelly!

04:01.601 --> 04:02.901
Oh, yeah.

04:02.901 --> 04:04.467
There was this
one thing, though.

04:04.467 --> 04:07.100
There's this girl
who looks just like me

04:07.100 --> 04:08.701
who got into
a peck of trouble today,

04:08.701 --> 04:11.367
so if the principal calls and--

04:11.367 --> 04:14.801
Gee, Mom,
you look fantastic,

04:14.801 --> 04:15.667
and, Dad...

04:17.100 --> 04:20.868
Doesn't Mom look fantastic?

04:20.868 --> 04:24.200
Hey, what say we unplug
the phones and play Yahtzee?

04:24.200 --> 04:25.801
Dad, I couldn't find your belt,

04:25.801 --> 04:28.868
but I figured
we'd tie her down with this...

04:31.100 --> 04:32.100
Hi, Kelly.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.734
You told, didn't you?

04:33.734 --> 04:35.534
Just about the spray painting,

04:35.534 --> 04:38.200
not that you came in
at 2 a.m. last night.

04:40.601 --> 04:42.467
Oops.

04:42.467 --> 04:44.801
You know you're going to be
punished for this, don't you?

04:44.801 --> 04:47.033
Well, you're gonna
have to take a number.

04:47.033 --> 04:49.367
They're already
punishing me at school.

04:49.367 --> 04:50.934
Principal Wicker's
been out to get me

04:50.934 --> 04:52.901
ever since I stole
her stupid husband.

04:56.701 --> 05:00.400
I mean, some chalk.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.067
Well, what's she
going to do to you?

05:02.067 --> 05:03.467
I have to join
the tap club.

05:03.467 --> 05:06.400
With the nerds
and the geeks?

05:06.400 --> 05:09.601
Nerds, dips, feebs
and geeks.
[GROANS]

05:09.601 --> 05:11.601
I either tap,
or I'm out of school.

05:11.601 --> 05:13.033
What would you do, Mom?

05:13.033 --> 05:15.467
I'd quit school.

05:15.467 --> 05:18.133
Way to go, Supermom.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.300
I can't quit school.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.634
I need school.
It's like my office.

05:23.634 --> 05:25.133
I check in, I get my messages,

05:25.133 --> 05:28.300
I go to lunch...

05:28.300 --> 05:31.667
I close a couple of deals,
and I go home.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.667
I mean, if I'm on the streets,
I'm just another...

05:33.667 --> 05:34.868
Flophouse toy?

05:36.767 --> 05:40.467
No, girl-repellent.

05:40.467 --> 05:42.701
I need school.
I belong there.

05:42.701 --> 05:43.701
It's where I'm cool.

05:43.701 --> 05:44.968
It's where I'm important.

05:44.968 --> 05:49.000
It's where
I can get a hot meal.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.834
But if I tap,
I'll be branded as an ortho.

05:51.834 --> 05:53.868
Oh, God, my brain hurts.
Somebody help me.

05:53.868 --> 05:55.501
Okay, look.

05:55.501 --> 05:58.467
Kelly, what you did was wrong.

05:58.467 --> 06:00.767
It was funny, though.

06:00.767 --> 06:02.033
But wrong.

06:02.033 --> 06:03.334
Uh, I guess.

06:03.334 --> 06:05.200
Look, there's two things
that Bundys don't do:

06:05.200 --> 06:09.167
We don't eat vegetables,
and we don't tap.

06:09.167 --> 06:11.000
So take one more tap class,

06:11.000 --> 06:13.434
and tomorrow
I'll get up,

06:13.434 --> 06:15.267
paint one of my ankles,
go to work,

06:15.267 --> 06:16.868
and then after that,
I'll see your principal.

06:16.868 --> 06:18.234
Thanks, Daddy.

06:18.234 --> 06:19.634
Then I'll go
to the airport,

06:19.634 --> 06:21.834
and I'll go to Borneo,

06:21.834 --> 06:23.400
where I'll be I'll be known as

Roll,

06:28.968 --> 06:30.000
fold,

06:30.000 --> 06:32.834
and flip.

06:32.834 --> 06:34.701
See? It's easy.

06:34.701 --> 06:37.868
Steve's mother used to
twist, twist, and tuck.

06:37.868 --> 06:41.901
Of course,
Steve's mother is an idiot.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.567
She sewed his name
in his underwear

06:43.567 --> 06:45.234
when we got married, you know.

06:45.234 --> 06:47.868
Al's mother just threw up
in the dip.

06:50.267 --> 06:52.634
They can't let go,
can they?

06:52.634 --> 06:54.033
How come Al
has so many socks?

06:54.033 --> 06:55.934
Well, last night,

06:55.934 --> 06:58.367
after Al learned
that a man with $20

06:58.367 --> 07:00.968
is not a king in Borneo,

07:00.968 --> 07:02.834
he went out to buy some socks

07:02.834 --> 07:07.200
at Bob's Pre-owned
Socks 'N Stuff.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.667
He's on this weird
sock quest,

07:09.667 --> 07:10.834
and he just won't believe

07:10.834 --> 07:13.334
that I don't lose them
on purpose.

07:13.334 --> 07:15.200
Does Steve blame you
when his socks disappear?

07:15.200 --> 07:17.434
Oh, Steve never loses a sock.

07:17.434 --> 07:21.167
He pins them together
before I wash them.

07:21.167 --> 07:24.133
Another tip from Mommy.

07:24.133 --> 07:27.501
Yeah, Al's mother had
a tip for him too,

07:27.501 --> 07:29.834
"Don't eat the dip tonight."

[TAPPING FOOTSTEPS]

07:40.334 --> 07:43.767

07:43.767 --> 07:46.234
Honey, what happened
to your shoes?

07:46.234 --> 07:47.634
Oh, same thing
that happens

07:47.634 --> 07:48.934
to all
nerds' possessions--

07:48.934 --> 07:51.467
The cool kids stole them
and threw them down the sewer.

07:51.467 --> 07:52.834
Then they said,

07:52.834 --> 07:55.400
"Gee, I wish Kelly was here
to see this girl crying."

07:55.400 --> 07:57.701
Well, how was class?

07:57.701 --> 08:00.033
Oh, it was keen, Mom.

08:00.033 --> 08:02.100
Today, they made me dance
with Marty Newberger,

08:02.100 --> 08:05.667
the four-eyed saliva machine.

He wants to be friends.

08:08.868 --> 08:10.300
Kelly's principal

08:10.300 --> 08:12.234
is making her
take tap dancing.

08:12.234 --> 08:15.133
Oh, how wonderful!

08:15.133 --> 08:17.601
I took tap and cotillion
when I was growing up.

08:17.601 --> 08:18.601
Isn't it fun?

08:18.601 --> 08:20.634
Fun?

08:20.634 --> 08:22.501
The whole class
is geeks and dweebs.

08:22.501 --> 08:23.567
Really?

08:23.567 --> 08:24.734
When I took tap,

08:24.734 --> 08:27.968
there were no geeks or dweebs
in my class.

08:32.366 --> 08:34.333
Well, I'm gonna
shuffle off, shuffle off,

08:34.333 --> 08:37.267
shuffle off
in front of a truck.

08:38.933 --> 08:40.634
Daddy,
did you talk to the principal?

08:40.634 --> 08:43.133
Did you save my life?
Did you get me off?

08:43.133 --> 08:45.267
Did Daddy ever
let you down before?

08:45.267 --> 08:46.367
Lots of times.

08:46.367 --> 08:47.501
Then you won't be surprised

08:47.501 --> 08:48.968
at what Daddy
has to say to you.

08:52.133 --> 08:53.534
I went into
Mrs. Wicker's office

08:53.534 --> 08:55.133
and had it out
with her man-to-man.

08:55.133 --> 08:57.634
I forgot how much
she hated me.

08:57.634 --> 08:59.767
Peg, she remembered
you, too.

08:59.767 --> 09:01.367
She called you
"The Big Easy."

09:03.667 --> 09:05.200
Well, we get into it,

09:05.200 --> 09:07.200
I called her Big Nose,
she called me One Sock,

09:07.200 --> 09:08.834
and, uh, well,
the upshot is--

09:08.834 --> 09:10.133
The upshot is

09:10.133 --> 09:11.968
I'm not allowed within
100 yards of the school

09:11.968 --> 09:13.434
until the night
of your dance recital.

09:13.434 --> 09:15.467
I don't have to do
a dance recital.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.968
You do now.

09:17.968 --> 09:19.968
Boy, I'm hungry. What do
we got in the fridge?

09:19.968 --> 09:23.367
A milk carton
with a tree growing out of it.

09:23.367 --> 09:25.667
Well, chop it down,
cook it up.

09:28.934 --> 09:30.367
Uh, doesn't
anybody care

09:30.367 --> 09:31.400
that we seem to be

09:31.400 --> 09:32.801
glossing over
the end of my life?

09:32.801 --> 09:35.367
Uh, excuse me here,

09:35.367 --> 09:38.033
but there is nothing wrong
with tap.

09:38.033 --> 09:39.167
I tap.

09:39.167 --> 09:40.501
Steve taps.

09:40.501 --> 09:42.634
Sammy Davis Jr. taps,

09:42.634 --> 09:45.667
and he is one hep black cat.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.501
Tap is an art form.

09:47.501 --> 09:52.167
Open yourself to tap,
you'll never look back.

09:53.834 --> 09:57.467
Mom, while Mrs. Rhoades
finishes her geek attack,

09:57.467 --> 09:59.868
let me explain
this to you

09:59.868 --> 10:02.133
so that
you can understand.

10:02.133 --> 10:03.834
There's this guy.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.300
He is a god...

10:05.300 --> 10:09.067
the janitor
at our school.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.300
So obviously
all the girls want him.

10:11.300 --> 10:14.400
Okay, I'm with you,
I'm with you.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.167
All right, so I've been
playing it cool.

10:16.167 --> 10:18.100
You know, a little smile,
a little wink,

10:18.100 --> 10:21.067
a little, "Hey, Bruno,
look at this."

10:21.067 --> 10:22.267
You know,
he's on the hook,

10:22.267 --> 10:23.667
and I'm just about
to land him.

10:23.667 --> 10:24.868
He thinks I'm cool,

10:24.868 --> 10:26.467
but if he sees me wearing
these horseshoes,

10:26.467 --> 10:27.868
he's gonna go for
some other slut.

10:27.868 --> 10:28.734
Oh, Mom!

10:35.033 --> 10:37.501
Honey, you may not
believe this now,

10:37.501 --> 10:41.634
but there will be
other janitors.

10:41.634 --> 10:43.868
Not like this one.

10:43.868 --> 10:46.000
Oh, I know, I know,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.167
but honey, we're not rich enough
to send you to private school,

10:49.167 --> 10:51.901
you're not smart enough

12:55.133 --> 12:57.133
you're not tuned in to
the true spirit of tap

12:57.133 --> 12:58.400
and what tap
can do for you.

12:59.901 --> 13:01.501
Now, tap can be your
friend, you know,

don't invite you
to their parties.

When everybody else
is out having fun,

13:09.167 --> 13:11.334
but you're home, studying,

13:11.334 --> 13:12.667
trying to make something
of yourself,

13:12.667 --> 13:13.734
so that someday

13:13.734 --> 13:15.868
you can own the best car
in the neighborhood.

13:15.868 --> 13:17.868
And on those mornings
when you look in the mirror,

13:17.868 --> 13:21.567
and see a guy
who's pretty darn good-looking,

13:21.567 --> 13:24.734
but shunned
because of his intelligence.

13:24.734 --> 13:26.434
But they'll be sorry someday,

13:26.434 --> 13:29.701
because everybody needs
a car or a home loan,

13:29.701 --> 13:34.133
and that's when they come
crawling on their bellies to me.

13:34.133 --> 13:37.601
So I guess "Steve, Steve,
the school's pet peeve"

13:37.601 --> 13:39.767

13:51.334 --> 13:54.234
tap builds character
for people who need it.

she's out of school.
