00:02.097 --> 00:05.597
(film projector whirring)

00:10.013 --> 00:13.096
(gentle piano music)

00:20.090 --> 00:22.480
- Oh, yeah. I don't think I'm gonna go.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.533
I'll just stay here, watch a movie.

00:27.220 --> 00:30.995
I know, I know. I never go
out with you guys anymore.

00:30.995 --> 00:33.995
(suspenseful music)

00:45.410 --> 00:46.920
Listen...

00:46.920 --> 00:49.063
I'm dying for some me time.

00:49.063 --> 00:50.963
I just really need to stay in tonight.

00:51.852 --> 00:54.519
(ominous music)

00:57.390 --> 00:58.393
I know.

00:59.900 --> 01:00.850
I know.

01:00.850 --> 01:03.015
Me and my excuses.

01:03.015 --> 01:05.682
(ominous music)

01:07.110 --> 01:08.683
Okay. Have a drink for me.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.623
You guys have fun and be safe.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.250
All right, bye.

01:16.606 --> 01:17.590
(suspenseful music)

01:17.590 --> 01:20.282
(tapping on window)

01:20.282 --> 01:22.949
(ominous music)

01:45.977 --> 01:48.644
(water running)

01:53.451 --> 01:56.451
(suspenseful music)

02:04.899 --> 02:05.732
Hello?

02:12.201 --> 02:14.868
(door creaking)

02:25.523 --> 02:28.356
(startling music)

02:39.340 --> 02:41.800
(pad slaps table)

02:41.800 --> 02:42.883
- Why is she naked?

02:43.920 --> 02:46.090
- Do you shower with clothes on?

02:46.090 --> 02:49.390
- I don't, but Mary Rose
was not found in her home,

02:49.390 --> 02:52.440
and she was not nude when
they discovered her body,

02:52.440 --> 02:56.490
so I'm wondering why she's
getting naked in this scenario.

02:56.490 --> 02:58.880
- Look, horror fans want certain things

02:58.880 --> 03:00.610
in their films, okay?

03:00.610 --> 03:01.443
- Tits?

03:02.360 --> 03:04.160
- Among other things.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.660
- Like, what else?

03:05.660 --> 03:08.790
- Blood, clowns, and incest hillbillies,

03:08.790 --> 03:11.430
which you two shot down immediately!

03:11.430 --> 03:12.300
- I'm still against those.

03:12.300 --> 03:15.083
- I still feel fine about
that decision, by the way.

03:15.083 --> 03:16.250
- Fine.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.510
- Before we proceed any further,

03:17.510 --> 03:21.280
I've mentioned this before, but
I'm just gonna say it again.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.840
Is this exploitative?

03:22.840 --> 03:25.910
- Since when did showing a
beautiful woman's body on camera

03:25.910 --> 03:27.320
become exploitative?

03:27.320 --> 03:29.050
- I'm not talking about the nude scene.

03:29.050 --> 03:32.220
I'm talking about writing a horror movie

03:32.220 --> 03:34.540
about murders that are
taking place, you know,

03:34.540 --> 03:38.850
among our neighbors and community
in the very recent past.

03:38.850 --> 03:41.110
- You're right. You're right.

03:41.110 --> 03:43.730
We'll get a few angry emails,
a couple of bad reviews,

03:43.730 --> 03:46.070
but look, guys, this is gonna be huge!

03:46.070 --> 03:48.340
Think about it. Who's done this before?

03:48.340 --> 03:50.980
A movie about a murderer
that's still at large.

03:50.980 --> 03:54.173
Think about it. You're in the
theater watching this movie.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.883
Who's that? Is that your friend, John?

03:59.490 --> 04:00.690
Or is that the murderer?

04:02.060 --> 04:03.243
- That's interesting.

04:04.490 --> 04:06.510
- I don't wanna step on
anybody's toes or anything,

04:06.510 --> 04:08.140
and I'm not a writer,

04:08.140 --> 04:11.910
but I am a little nervous about
looking into these murders

04:11.910 --> 04:13.430
with them still being active.

04:13.430 --> 04:15.180
There's a lot of stuff we don't know.

04:15.180 --> 04:18.170
- Right, we wanna make sure
that it's told correctly,

04:18.170 --> 04:19.930
for one thing.

04:19.930 --> 04:22.120
Of course, I also have
concerns about the fact

04:22.120 --> 04:25.293
that the story doesn't have an ending.

04:26.660 --> 04:28.232
- That's true.

04:28.232 --> 04:30.060
- One the one hand,
yes, that's very scary.

04:30.060 --> 04:32.183
He could still be among us and all that.

04:33.210 --> 04:34.043
On the other hand,

04:34.043 --> 04:36.490
we had three murders within four months

04:36.490 --> 04:38.483
and then four months of nothing.

04:40.340 --> 04:42.360
- That's where you come in.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.300
Look, we know a lot about what's going on,

04:44.300 --> 04:47.000
but it's safe to say that
there's a lot we don't know.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.783
I say we spice it up a little bit.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.150
Take a few artistic liberties.

04:55.150 --> 04:56.900
- It could be artsy.

04:56.900 --> 04:59.090
- Spice, okay, so...

05:00.540 --> 05:02.410
What are you thinking?

05:02.410 --> 05:05.223
- Well, now that you
ask, just bear with me.

05:06.260 --> 05:10.100
Our killer. This is
all just a game to him.

05:10.100 --> 05:13.510
But guess what? Regular season's over.

05:13.510 --> 05:14.590
He's clenched his division.

05:14.590 --> 05:17.490
He's in the playoffs with a bye week.

05:17.490 --> 05:18.930
- I don't do sports.

05:18.930 --> 05:21.210
- I follow you.

05:21.210 --> 05:22.133
- He's planning.

05:23.130 --> 05:27.690
Preparing for his next
big game. His Super Bowl.

05:27.690 --> 05:31.270
A fucking blood bath!

05:31.270 --> 05:32.150
- Okay, but...

05:33.260 --> 05:35.310
Where's all the blood coming from?

05:35.310 --> 05:37.150
There was dismemberment, yes.

05:37.150 --> 05:39.770
There are parts missing
from the bodies found,

05:39.770 --> 05:42.330
but the actual cause of
death was strangulation.

05:42.330 --> 05:44.083
The mutilation was posthumous.

05:45.940 --> 05:46.773
- She's right.

05:47.650 --> 05:50.470
- Look, do you guys
wanna make a documentary

05:50.470 --> 05:52.210
or a good movie?

05:52.210 --> 05:54.000
- I'm sorry that these women's deaths

05:54.000 --> 05:56.200
were not exciting enough for you, Seth!

05:56.200 --> 05:58.560
- That's not what I meant.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.550
- We don't know a lot
about the people involved.

06:00.550 --> 06:02.330
Maybe there needs to be some research.

06:02.330 --> 06:03.970
Like the killer, we don't even know

06:03.970 --> 06:05.310
is he a good guy, bad guy?

06:05.310 --> 06:06.390
- They're not a good person.

06:06.390 --> 06:07.890
- He's a psychopath.

06:07.890 --> 06:10.530
- Well, I mean, maybe, yeah.

06:10.530 --> 06:11.940
It's worth mentioning, like you said,

06:11.940 --> 06:14.653
there haven't been any
deaths in several months.

06:15.780 --> 06:17.423
He could be done.

06:18.990 --> 06:19.823
- Yeah.

06:21.300 --> 06:23.260
All right, so we're talking
about spinning an ending

06:23.260 --> 06:25.270
out of thin air.

06:25.270 --> 06:26.250
We'll write down ideas,

06:26.250 --> 06:30.000
make sure that everybody
feels heard in the scenario.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.630
I'm putting Seth down for a blood bath,

06:32.630 --> 06:34.480
total effing blood bath.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.570
- Thank you.

06:35.570 --> 06:37.320
- And Mark...

06:37.320 --> 06:38.390
Done.

06:38.390 --> 06:39.990
- Done.

06:39.990 --> 06:42.253
- I'm just gonna write that. Done.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.130
- And on that exciting note,

06:46.130 --> 06:47.680
I think we're done for the day.

06:50.123 --> 06:52.623
(car dinging)

06:54.031 --> 06:56.698
(anxious music)

08:16.848 --> 08:19.598
(dramatic music)

08:35.172 --> 08:37.922
(tinkling music)

09:01.335 --> 09:04.347
♪ My heart will fly to heaven ♪

09:04.347 --> 09:07.869
♪ On the day he'll be mine ♪

09:07.869 --> 09:11.416
♪ We'll be standing on the threshold ♪

09:11.416 --> 09:15.117
♪ Of a moment divine ♪

09:15.117 --> 09:18.460
♪ And from that day forever ♪

09:18.460 --> 09:22.027
♪ We will leave hand in hand ♪

09:22.027 --> 09:24.150
♪ It's the day of days ♪

09:24.150 --> 09:29.150
♪ The one for which I've
dreamed and I've planned ♪

09:46.122 --> 09:49.955
(sentimental orchestra music)

09:52.060 --> 09:53.430
- [Mara] Quickly, Truson!

09:53.430 --> 09:55.410
I have a key! The jailer's a friend!

09:55.410 --> 09:56.440
You must escape!

09:56.440 --> 09:57.923
- [Truson] I can't leave. No.

09:59.196 --> 10:02.460
- [Mara] But why? I want to go with you!

10:02.460 --> 10:03.650
- [Truson] No, Mara.

10:03.650 --> 10:05.760
Running away is not the solution.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.400
Don't you see?

10:07.400 --> 10:09.200
We'll not find peace anywhere else

10:09.200 --> 10:10.863
until we find it here first.

10:11.808 --> 10:14.800
- [Mara] But I fear for
your safety if you stay.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.617
I know they mean to harm you.

10:17.998 --> 10:21.665
(emotional orchestra music)

11:18.840 --> 11:21.507
(ominous music)

11:24.206 --> 11:26.873
(keys jangling)

11:41.195 --> 11:44.862
(dramatic orchestral music)

11:52.013 --> 11:54.680
(phone ringing)

11:57.886 --> 12:00.170
(phone ringing)

12:00.170 --> 12:01.003
- Hello?

12:03.738 --> 12:04.588
Is someone there?

12:21.511 --> 12:24.511
(breathing heavily)

12:26.770 --> 12:28.230
- Hello?

12:28.230 --> 12:29.340
- [Holly] Mark?

12:29.340 --> 12:30.640
- Holly?

12:30.640 --> 12:31.610
- [Holly] Yeah.

12:31.610 --> 12:33.000
Did I catch you at a bad time?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.330
- Um, I'm...

12:34.330 --> 12:35.750
No, no, this is fine.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.510
What's up? Perfect time.

12:37.510 --> 12:38.820
- [Holly] Okay.

12:38.820 --> 12:40.263
I was just calling to say,

12:41.220 --> 12:44.820
I hope that you didn't feel
like we drowned you out today.

12:44.820 --> 12:45.930
You were kinda quiet.

12:45.930 --> 12:50.930
I know I can be loud, and he can be loud.

12:50.970 --> 12:53.493
And if we're gonna collaborate creatively,

12:54.380 --> 12:56.830
everybody needs to feel
like they're being heard.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.480
- Wow, that's really considerate of you

13:01.480 --> 13:03.270
to think about me like that.

13:03.270 --> 13:04.103
Thank you.

13:05.480 --> 13:09.870
If I'm being honest,
lately I've been sort of...

13:09.870 --> 13:12.970
stunted creatively and...

13:12.970 --> 13:13.803
otherwise.

13:13.803 --> 13:14.636
It's like I...

13:15.550 --> 13:18.820
I try to get out there,
you know, and step to it,

13:18.820 --> 13:21.280
and it's just like I just don't have

13:21.280 --> 13:25.520
any kind of motivation anymore
or inspiration, I don't know.

13:25.520 --> 13:26.743
It's my fault, I guess.

13:27.750 --> 13:28.583
- [Holly] No, no.

13:28.583 --> 13:30.933
I've felt the exact same way sometimes.

13:32.050 --> 13:33.700
And, you know, no pressure.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.270
I'm not trying to force you.

13:35.270 --> 13:37.660
You can't force creativity, but,

13:37.660 --> 13:39.310
you know, hopefully along the way

13:39.310 --> 13:43.770
you will rediscover some of
your creativity and passion,

13:43.770 --> 13:46.483
and hopefully I will get to see it.

13:48.050 --> 13:48.883
- Yeah.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.153
Thanks.

13:52.010 --> 13:53.080
Thanks.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.060
- [Holly] Anyway, that's it.

13:54.060 --> 13:56.850
I'll let you get back to
whatever it is you're doing,

13:56.850 --> 13:59.206
and see you at the next one.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.178
- Okay, yeah, see you then.

14:01.178 --> 14:03.595
(soft music)

14:08.896 --> 14:09.729
Huh.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.314
(eerie music)

14:29.101 --> 14:31.768
(ominous music)

14:39.541 --> 14:42.374
(heavy breathing)

15:01.254 --> 15:04.254
(suspenseful music)

15:25.949 --> 15:28.449
(music stops)

15:29.513 --> 15:31.930
(soft music)

15:37.098 --> 15:42.098
(ominous music)
(car honks)

15:42.770 --> 15:44.007
(dramatic music)
(woman gasps)

15:44.007 --> 15:46.674
(woman screams)

15:51.640 --> 15:53.140
- I'm gonna lose the fog,

15:53.140 --> 15:56.970
because I don't remember the
last time that we had a fog

15:56.970 --> 15:59.300
so thick you can barely see through it.

15:59.300 --> 16:02.620
- But that would look so good on camera!

16:02.620 --> 16:05.860
- I mean, maybe that's how it went.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.334
(slap)

16:09.334 --> 16:10.167
- Oh! God!

16:10.167 --> 16:11.000
Ow! Ow!

16:11.000 --> 16:12.035
Stop it! Stop it!

16:12.035 --> 16:14.170
(groaning)

16:14.170 --> 16:15.910
- Okay, well how about this?

16:15.910 --> 16:18.800
She's out on her late night jog, no fog.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.140
Our stalker's been after her all night.

16:21.140 --> 16:24.820
He's been sneaking around,
hiding behind bushes, trees.

16:24.820 --> 16:25.653
- Okay.

16:25.653 --> 16:26.560
- Until...

16:26.560 --> 16:27.713
he makes a mistake.

16:28.890 --> 16:30.610
He steps on a stick.

16:30.610 --> 16:32.250
She turns and notice, he panics!

16:32.250 --> 16:33.160
He chases after her!

16:33.160 --> 16:35.010
She runs to her nearest neighbor,

16:35.010 --> 16:36.128
starts beating on the door!

16:36.128 --> 16:38.370
"Help, help, someone's gonna kill me!"

16:38.370 --> 16:40.650
As the neighbor comes
through the door, boom!

16:40.650 --> 16:42.320
Knife through the back and out the stomach

16:42.320 --> 16:45.171
and blood goes everywhere!

16:45.171 --> 16:47.338
(panting)

16:50.020 --> 16:52.403
- Oh, that was for real? That was serious?

16:53.400 --> 16:54.610
That is...

16:54.610 --> 16:56.980
Did you read the articles on the kills?

16:56.980 --> 16:59.440
I mean, that's not even close.

16:59.440 --> 17:00.300
- I'm not...

17:01.360 --> 17:04.050
I'm not trying to be critical...

17:04.050 --> 17:05.163
but I'm gonna be.

17:06.120 --> 17:09.740
This sounds like a very
generic slasher film.

17:09.740 --> 17:11.170
- Generic?

17:11.170 --> 17:13.050
How is this generic?

17:13.050 --> 17:16.750
Look, what's different here
is that this could be anyone.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.130
It could be your neighbor.

17:18.130 --> 17:20.380
It could be your mom for all we know.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.423
- No, Seth, it couldn't.

17:23.590 --> 17:26.040
I think you're missing
what makes this whole thing

17:26.040 --> 17:27.590
interesting and special,

17:27.590 --> 17:30.380
and that's the fact that
it is a very specific story

17:30.380 --> 17:32.810
that couldn't happen to just anyone.

17:32.810 --> 17:35.975
The killer obviously has their own ideas.

17:35.975 --> 17:36.808
- Right.

17:36.808 --> 17:39.395
- And a very detail-oriented
way of doing this.

17:39.395 --> 17:40.228
- Exactly.

17:40.228 --> 17:41.160
- And we need to approach it

17:41.160 --> 17:43.006
with that same level of observation...

17:43.006 --> 17:43.839
- Thank you.

17:43.839 --> 17:45.350
- [Holly] If this is the
story that we want to tell.

17:45.350 --> 17:47.140
- Exactly. That's what I was gonna say.

17:47.140 --> 17:49.570
- And it couldn't happen
to my neighbor or my mom,

17:49.570 --> 17:51.440
because he has a type.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.710
He has a profile that
he has been following.

17:53.710 --> 17:55.100
And it's not just women.
- Right.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.030
- Or even women...
- No.

17:56.030 --> 17:57.620
- In a specific age demographic.

17:57.620 --> 17:59.506
He has consistently targeted women...

17:59.506 --> 18:00.339
- Right.

18:00.339 --> 18:01.373
- With flower names.
- That remind him of his mom.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.248
- What?
- What?

18:04.120 --> 18:05.470
- Oh, they all had flower names.

18:05.470 --> 18:07.560
You know, there was Mary-Rose Jones.

18:07.560 --> 18:08.920
There was Iris Johnson.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.763
And then there was Heather Beech.

18:12.324 --> 18:13.157
- Huh!

18:15.210 --> 18:16.983
Wow, that is something!

18:18.270 --> 18:20.180
- The murder-lizer.

18:20.180 --> 18:21.310
- What?

18:21.310 --> 18:23.997
- It's like fertilizer, but with murder.

18:23.997 --> 18:25.200
- No.
- No, that's...

18:25.200 --> 18:26.180
What?

18:26.180 --> 18:27.400
- The petal clipper.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.540
- Oh!

18:28.540 --> 18:29.740
- The petal-phile.

18:29.740 --> 18:30.810
- What? No!

18:30.810 --> 18:32.710
- The greenhouse strangler.

18:32.710 --> 18:33.950
- Awful.

18:33.950 --> 18:35.290
- The botanist.

18:35.290 --> 18:36.490
- Why are we doing this?

18:37.940 --> 18:39.433
- The gardener.

18:40.310 --> 18:41.940
- I don't hate gardener.

18:41.940 --> 18:42.920
- See?

18:42.920 --> 18:44.850
We don't have to decide
on the name right now,

18:44.850 --> 18:47.290
but we take the imagery of
someone slashing a flower

18:47.290 --> 18:48.670
then slashing a girl.

18:48.670 --> 18:51.430
Flower, girl, flower, girl.

18:51.430 --> 18:52.980
- No one gut slashed!

18:52.980 --> 18:53.813
- Thank you.

18:53.813 --> 18:55.780
- The cause of death was...

18:55.780 --> 18:56.730
strangulation.

18:56.730 --> 18:58.490
- Exactly, strangulation.

18:58.490 --> 19:00.770
There is, from what I read,

19:00.770 --> 19:03.290
a very certain intimacy with strangulation

19:03.290 --> 19:04.630
that's specific to the killer.

19:04.630 --> 19:06.770
That's the whole point, right?

19:06.770 --> 19:10.590
- Strangulation is boring!

19:10.590 --> 19:12.400
The fans, they want entertainment!

19:12.400 --> 19:16.053
They want blood, they want
screams, they want horror!

19:18.820 --> 19:20.410
You know what?

19:20.410 --> 19:21.610
Enough talking about it.

19:22.670 --> 19:23.543
I'll show you.

19:24.640 --> 19:25.473
Come outside.

19:29.401 --> 19:31.167
I'm not gonna slash you.

19:33.926 --> 19:36.593
(anxious music)

19:51.871 --> 19:52.901
(suspenseful music)

19:52.901 --> 19:54.920
(ax thuds)

19:54.920 --> 19:56.670
- Welcome, class!

19:56.670 --> 19:58.670
In today's lesson we will be talking

19:58.670 --> 20:00.880
about two different things.

20:00.880 --> 20:01.820
Fear...

20:02.770 --> 20:04.360
and compromise.

20:04.360 --> 20:07.020
For these lessons, I'll
need some assistance.

20:07.020 --> 20:07.993
Any volunteers?

20:09.370 --> 20:10.203
Holly?

20:14.991 --> 20:16.550
Ah, ah!

20:16.550 --> 20:17.383
Take a knee.

20:18.790 --> 20:20.290
- Can't wait for this lawsuit.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.070
- Lesson number one.

20:23.070 --> 20:24.520
Compromise.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.640
The articles say the
victims were dismembered

20:26.640 --> 20:27.600
post-mortem, correct?

20:27.600 --> 20:28.480
- Yes.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.730
I like that. I liked that.

20:29.730 --> 20:31.070
But...

20:31.070 --> 20:32.220
what do you say...

20:33.250 --> 20:36.090
we just moved the
timeline up a little bit?

20:36.090 --> 20:38.340
It still sticks to the dismemberment.

20:38.340 --> 20:42.239
It's just right before death
instead of right after.

20:42.239 --> 20:45.100
I think you can agree that
that's not too big of a jump.

20:45.100 --> 20:48.630
So, the killer has his victim tied up.

20:48.630 --> 20:53.070
The camera's from below,
shooting up on our killer,

20:53.070 --> 20:56.603
a position of dominance, of power!

20:57.860 --> 21:01.673
He takes her hand, tries to
build a little trust with her.

21:04.310 --> 21:05.373
He places it down.

21:06.270 --> 21:09.950
He starts, finger by...

21:09.950 --> 21:10.783
finger!

21:12.550 --> 21:15.133
Until she's nothing but
a bloody mess to hide.

21:16.630 --> 21:18.370
- I don't understand what
you're talking about.

21:18.370 --> 21:22.010
This killer, it's not
about empowering himself

21:22.010 --> 21:23.650
or showing dominance over somebody else.

21:23.650 --> 21:27.030
It's about getting
something inside of him out

21:27.030 --> 21:28.443
that he doesn't want.

21:29.510 --> 21:32.360
- Do you want to go back to
making commercials for my dad?

21:32.360 --> 21:33.443
- Okay. All right.

21:33.443 --> 21:35.693
So, let's talk intimidation.

21:37.010 --> 21:40.140
You have a weapon. You can lose a weapon.

21:40.140 --> 21:43.070
You can drop a weapon. It
can be taken away from you.

21:43.070 --> 21:46.730
You can even lose it in a
body at some point in time.

21:46.730 --> 21:49.630
Now, if we wanna talk about fear,

21:49.630 --> 21:51.950
if you're wanting to
sell the victim's fear...

21:51.950 --> 21:52.783
Take a seat.

21:54.310 --> 21:55.790
So if the idea that we're going with

21:55.790 --> 21:59.100
is that we're gonna sell
them on the victim's fear...

21:59.100 --> 22:02.440
I want you to imagine that
you're sharing this moment

22:02.440 --> 22:04.491
with someone that you trust.

22:04.491 --> 22:05.324
(soft string music)

22:05.324 --> 22:07.210
And then, suddenly, this...

22:07.210 --> 22:10.200
is the last thing, this face, these eyes,

22:10.200 --> 22:12.550
are the last things that you see.

22:12.550 --> 22:14.120
Imagine that realization.

22:14.120 --> 22:18.290
Imagine the intimacy, the
powerlessness of that moment.

22:18.290 --> 22:21.410
And on his side, he's feeling
her pulse get sluggish.

22:21.410 --> 22:24.860
He's feeling her breath
slow down and get shallower.

22:24.860 --> 22:26.330
Don't worry about him.

22:26.330 --> 22:29.180
There's no one in this
moment but him and her.

22:29.180 --> 22:31.030
He doesn't need a weapon.

22:31.030 --> 22:33.520
All he needs is the two of them.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.010
Imagine he's wearing glasses
and we see them get fogged up

22:36.010 --> 22:38.950
and fogged up until, suddenly...

22:38.950 --> 22:43.330
he sees clear as day as the
light goes out of her eyes.

22:43.330 --> 22:45.432
♪ The light goes out of her eyes ♪

22:45.432 --> 22:46.490
♪ Goes out of her eyes ♪

22:46.490 --> 22:48.070
♪ Out of out of out of out of ♪

22:48.070 --> 22:51.820
(energetic electronic music)

23:30.647 --> 23:32.124
(gasps)

23:32.124 --> 23:32.970
(coughs)

23:32.970 --> 23:34.850
It's primal.

23:34.850 --> 23:35.923
It's intimate.

23:36.900 --> 23:38.203
It's terrifying.

23:39.100 --> 23:40.910
Strangulation can be scary.

23:40.910 --> 23:43.323
Mark, do you wanna
chime in on any of this?

23:51.480 --> 23:53.023
Nice! You freaked him out!

23:54.160 --> 23:55.253
- I freaked him out?

23:56.109 --> 23:57.259
What the fuck was that?

23:59.849 --> 24:03.182
(soft orchestral music)

24:27.560 --> 24:28.393
- [Holly] Hey.

24:30.697 --> 24:32.610
do you care if I join you?

24:32.610 --> 24:33.443
- Sure.

24:35.110 --> 24:36.200
- So...

24:37.510 --> 24:40.913
That's not my standard writing style.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.263
- I believe that.

24:44.820 --> 24:47.420
- This is why I write alone.

24:47.420 --> 24:48.750
It's just...

24:48.750 --> 24:50.023
It's more solitary.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.570
And it's not that I'm against compromise.

24:53.570 --> 24:55.310
It's just that...

24:55.310 --> 24:57.933
I kind of am against compromise.

24:59.320 --> 25:01.240
I don't know. Maybe it's an
only child thing, you know?

25:01.240 --> 25:02.740
Never really learned to share?

25:03.670 --> 25:07.400
- Actually, I started one of your books.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.233
- Oh yeah?

25:08.233 --> 25:09.810
- Mm-hm. It's good.

25:09.810 --> 25:10.690
- Thanks.

25:10.690 --> 25:14.230
- I don't normally do true
crime stuff, but I like it.

25:14.230 --> 25:16.743
There's a really good sense of detail.

25:17.720 --> 25:18.743
- I appreciate it.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.960
I mean, obviously, I don't
know how much of it is me.

25:21.960 --> 25:22.860
That's the thing,

25:22.860 --> 25:27.340
is that these are really
interesting stories.

25:27.340 --> 25:30.320
They're already well-crafted.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.730
You know?

25:31.730 --> 25:33.320
That's why I don't understand the need

25:33.320 --> 25:35.600
to add all this extra stuff

25:35.600 --> 25:38.343
as if it isn't already
interesting on its own.

25:39.370 --> 25:40.727
- Yeah.

25:40.727 --> 25:42.400
- I mean...

25:42.400 --> 25:45.000
I know that you've
worked with Seth before.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.280
I think he's a good guy.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.990
I just think he's kinda got this...

25:49.990 --> 25:52.010
scent of Hollywood in his nostrils,

25:52.010 --> 25:53.960
and he's not really letting go of that.

25:55.130 --> 25:56.830
- I could see that.

25:56.830 --> 25:58.710
Although, in his defense...

26:00.240 --> 26:03.990
maybe he's trying to figure
out where he belongs, you know?

26:03.990 --> 26:08.163
It can be really tough to see
how you fit into the world.

26:09.630 --> 26:11.140
- Yeah, maybe.

26:11.140 --> 26:14.610
- You know, that was
pretty impressive earlier

26:14.610 --> 26:16.543
with the names and the flowers.

26:18.037 --> 26:21.210
I didn't even notice that
myself, which is weird,

26:21.210 --> 26:23.780
so that was pretty cool.

26:23.780 --> 26:25.610
- Well, I mean, obviously
I didn't come up with it.

26:25.610 --> 26:28.150
It's just the pattern
that was established.

26:28.150 --> 26:28.983
I mean, that's the thing.

26:28.983 --> 26:30.780
If you pay attention,

26:30.780 --> 26:32.973
the important information
becomes apparent.

26:34.630 --> 26:36.250
- Yeah.

26:36.250 --> 26:37.400
This may be weird to say,

26:37.400 --> 26:39.940
but I always feel like
I'm pretty good at...

26:41.280 --> 26:43.703
observing, finding information.

26:45.460 --> 26:49.030
Doing photography, that's kind
of the point, is that you...

26:49.030 --> 26:52.943
watch someone and see if you
can figure out how they tick.

26:53.930 --> 26:55.130
- Yeah.

26:55.130 --> 26:57.813
It sounds like you have some
pretty interesting ideas.

26:58.670 --> 27:01.360
And if you spoke up a
little more frequently,

27:01.360 --> 27:02.973
we'd probably hear more of them.

27:04.060 --> 27:05.550
- Yeah.

27:05.550 --> 27:06.490
- Anyway...

27:07.440 --> 27:10.780
This has probably been a
cigarette's length of break,

27:10.780 --> 27:15.283
so I'm gonna head inside and make nice.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.840
- Hey, sorry if I was
kind of weird earlier

27:18.840 --> 27:21.110
when I walked off.

27:21.110 --> 27:22.400
- It's fine.

27:22.400 --> 27:23.390
Probably creeped you out.

27:23.390 --> 27:26.380
I can be a little scary sometimes.

27:26.380 --> 27:27.323
Anyway, see you.

27:34.706 --> 27:35.792
(anxious music)

27:35.792 --> 27:38.459
(camera clicks)

27:42.387 --> 27:45.220
(birds whistling)

27:54.660 --> 27:56.940
- So we can probably agree

27:56.940 --> 27:59.793
that we all equally made that weird.

28:01.470 --> 28:05.240
Obviously, I know a lot more
about the details of this case

28:05.240 --> 28:07.550
because I've done a lot of research.

28:07.550 --> 28:09.900
You know a lot about movies.

28:09.900 --> 28:12.130
So there needs to be a
way for us to compromise

28:12.130 --> 28:15.120
that does not involve axes or choking.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.810
So...

28:16.810 --> 28:20.210
let's walk through the
hypothetical targeting

28:20.210 --> 28:22.473
of Iris Johnson to her death.

28:23.680 --> 28:26.152
So, they meet somewhere.

28:26.152 --> 28:28.500
(ball bounces)

28:28.500 --> 28:29.333
- A bar.

28:30.190 --> 28:32.720
It's loud. Lots of people.

28:32.720 --> 28:33.883
He'd go unnoticed.

28:35.030 --> 28:38.663
He sees Iris sitting at
the bar and approaches.

28:39.636 --> 28:42.330
(ball bouncing)

28:42.330 --> 28:43.800
- Um...

28:43.800 --> 28:45.030
He sees her.

28:45.030 --> 28:48.790
She's wearing a white
blouse with purple flowers,

28:48.790 --> 28:50.763
and she smells like lavender.

28:53.476 --> 28:56.570
(ball bounces)

28:56.570 --> 28:57.813
- He approaches.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.630
He buys her a drink.

29:00.630 --> 29:03.370
They have a few
conversations, maybe a dance.

29:03.370 --> 29:05.240
They enjoy themselves.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.630
He's got that kind of look.

29:07.630 --> 29:08.730
But...

29:08.730 --> 29:09.733
it's closing time.

29:11.415 --> 29:12.340
(ball bounces)

29:12.340 --> 29:14.850
- They head out to her car,

29:14.850 --> 29:19.229
where her tire has been
mysteriously slashed.

29:19.229 --> 29:21.740
(ball bounces)

29:21.740 --> 29:22.573
- There's a...

29:23.810 --> 29:26.510
cartoon unicorn hanging
from the rear view mirror

29:26.510 --> 29:30.160
and a yellow bumper sticker.

29:30.160 --> 29:33.463
It's got a silly slogan on
it. It's torn on the corner.

29:36.554 --> 29:39.080
(ball bounces)

29:39.080 --> 29:43.550
He offers her a ride home
like any gentlemen would.

29:43.550 --> 29:46.200
She accepts, but...

29:46.200 --> 29:50.120
he takes a turn when she
didn't tell him to...

29:50.120 --> 29:53.932
down a dark, dark back road.

29:53.932 --> 29:54.765
(ball bounces)

29:54.765 --> 29:58.393
- She's obviously very nervous.
She goes for her cell phone.

29:59.382 --> 30:00.540
(ball bounces)

30:00.540 --> 30:01.990
- He notices.

30:01.990 --> 30:04.133
He panics and attacks!

30:05.020 --> 30:07.623
But Iris is a little
stronger than the rest.

30:08.510 --> 30:12.073
He pulls out a weapon.
Not a blade or a gun.

30:13.500 --> 30:14.333
A wire.

30:16.060 --> 30:17.650
You keep your strangulation...

30:19.100 --> 30:21.180
- And you get your bloodshed.

30:21.180 --> 30:23.373
That's good. That's really good.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.190
She tries to get her
hand in between the wire

30:27.190 --> 30:29.340
and her throat, but it's sharp.

30:29.340 --> 30:31.370
It cuts into her fingers.

30:31.370 --> 30:32.980
And he realizes that,

30:32.980 --> 30:35.820
to make it harder to figure
out what the weapon was,

30:35.820 --> 30:38.536
he's gonna need to remove the hand.

30:38.536 --> 30:40.789
(ball bounces)

30:40.789 --> 30:42.180
- Do you think he would...

30:44.540 --> 30:45.373
do anything?

30:47.316 --> 30:48.520
(ball bounces)

30:48.520 --> 30:51.590
- Even if he did, we wouldn't
include it in the movie.

30:51.590 --> 30:52.570
(somber music)

30:52.570 --> 30:53.610
- Okay.

30:53.610 --> 30:56.530
Even though he's obviously aroused,

30:56.530 --> 30:59.681
he takes her back home
to dismember the body.

30:59.681 --> 31:00.600
(ball bounces)

31:00.600 --> 31:03.750
- Would he take her home or
would he have something offsite?

31:03.750 --> 31:05.973
- He wouldn't take her home.

31:05.973 --> 31:06.900
- Um...

31:06.900 --> 31:10.940
Okay, so, maybe it's somewhere offsite.

31:10.940 --> 31:14.900
And even if we assume that
something sexual happened,

31:14.900 --> 31:15.848
we don't show it.

31:15.848 --> 31:16.980
(ball bounces)

31:16.980 --> 31:19.020
- He definitely wouldn't do
those sexual deviant things

31:19.020 --> 31:20.758
at his own house, right?

31:20.758 --> 31:21.740
(ball bounces)

31:21.740 --> 31:24.010
- I mean, we don't know that.

31:24.010 --> 31:25.920
But let's take it in
a different direction.

31:25.920 --> 31:29.070
What if she's not attracted
to him at the bar?

31:29.070 --> 31:31.313
Maybe he gives off a creepy vibe.

31:31.313 --> 31:32.600
(ball thuds)

31:32.600 --> 31:34.130
- Maybe he's ugly.

31:34.130 --> 31:35.600
Probably smells.

31:35.600 --> 31:38.340
Maybe that's why he's so attracted
to the scent of lavender.

31:38.340 --> 31:39.827
- Guys...

31:39.827 --> 31:40.660
(ball bounces)

31:40.660 --> 31:44.900
- So, then she doesn't accept
his offer for a ride home,

31:44.900 --> 31:48.810
and he attacks her right
outside of her own vehicle.

31:48.810 --> 31:50.210
- I mean, what do you think?

31:51.940 --> 31:52.773
- It's...

31:53.870 --> 31:55.390
This whole sexual deviancy thing,

31:55.390 --> 31:57.300
you guys are really just
flying off the handle.

31:57.300 --> 31:58.240
What's this...

31:58.240 --> 31:59.350
It's completely off track.

31:59.350 --> 32:00.940
It's nothing like the report said.

32:00.940 --> 32:02.133
I don't understand what you're doing.

32:02.133 --> 32:03.790
None of that happened, okay?

32:03.790 --> 32:05.990
I read the articles.
That's not how it went.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.170
- Um...

32:09.170 --> 32:10.170
Okay, well...

32:11.190 --> 32:12.350
floor's yours.

32:12.350 --> 32:15.060
What do you think? What drew him to her?

32:15.060 --> 32:16.663
Why is he doing what he's doing?

32:21.150 --> 32:24.550
- Maybe he sees a certain
style of clothing,

32:24.550 --> 32:27.370
and it reminds him of
somebody that he knew before

32:27.370 --> 32:30.563
that he hated or he
wanted and couldn't have.

32:31.710 --> 32:32.817
He's drawn to 'em.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.786
(ball bouncing)

32:39.826 --> 32:42.320
- I don't know that...

32:42.320 --> 32:45.150
killers are big followers
of fashion, Mark.

32:45.150 --> 32:49.483
But, I mean, it's a good
note. We'll think it over.

32:50.560 --> 32:53.640
I do like the idea of
exploring the common theme

32:53.640 --> 32:56.220
besides just the names with these women.

32:56.220 --> 32:58.330
So, maybe...

32:58.330 --> 32:59.930
I don't know, maybe we can...

33:01.020 --> 33:04.050
get to know them a little bit
better in whatever way we can.

33:04.050 --> 33:09.050
I can go to where someone
worked, maybe talk to a coworker.

33:09.650 --> 33:11.310
- I've got a list of acquaintances.

33:11.310 --> 33:13.810
I could see if they missed
anything in the report.

33:15.360 --> 33:18.033
- If I need to, there's
something I can do.

33:19.390 --> 33:20.390
- Great.

33:20.390 --> 33:21.578
So we've all got our homework.

33:21.578 --> 33:22.962
(ball bounces)

33:22.962 --> 33:24.295
- Yay, homework.

33:27.412 --> 33:31.329
(sentimental orchestral music)

33:42.570 --> 33:43.900
- Quickly, Truson!

33:43.900 --> 33:45.940
I have a key! The jailer's a friend!

33:45.940 --> 33:46.773
You must escape!

33:46.773 --> 33:48.453
- [Truson] I can't leave. No.

33:49.736 --> 33:52.940
- [Mara] But why? I want to go with you!

33:52.940 --> 33:56.260
- [Truson] No, Mara. Running
away is not the solution.

33:56.260 --> 33:57.890
Don't you see?

33:57.890 --> 33:59.710
We'll not find peace anywhere else

33:59.710 --> 34:02.266
until we find it here first.

34:02.266 --> 34:05.335
- [Mara] but I fear for
your safety if you stay!

34:05.335 --> 34:07.247
I know they mean to harm you.

34:07.247 --> 34:10.156
- [Truson] You said you were
willing to run away with me.

34:10.156 --> 34:13.030
Are you just as willing
to stay here in Hamelin?

34:13.030 --> 34:14.913
Stand beside me while I fight?

34:19.110 --> 34:20.360
- [Mara] Yes, my darling.

(peaceful orchestral music)

(footsteps)

37:20.455 --> 37:22.040
- Sorry for the wait.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.600
I was finishing a wreath.

37:23.600 --> 37:24.790
- No problem.

37:24.790 --> 37:26.440
- It was for funeral.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.370
- Oh.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.390
Sorry.

37:28.390 --> 37:29.300
- Ah, no, don't be.

37:29.300 --> 37:32.183
The murders have actually
been really good for business.

37:32.183 --> 37:33.016
- Oh.

37:33.016 --> 37:33.849
Silver lining.

37:34.770 --> 37:37.670
- So you're here to talk about Heather.

37:37.670 --> 37:40.083
- Yeah. Can you tell
me a little about her?

37:41.760 --> 37:43.230
- Not much to tell.

37:43.230 --> 37:45.560
I didn't know her all that well.

37:45.560 --> 37:46.860
She was cool though.

37:46.860 --> 37:48.483
You know, funny.

37:49.740 --> 37:52.763
She got all of her work done
on time, so good for her.

37:53.700 --> 37:55.530
- So, did she seem okay

37:55.530 --> 37:57.560
in the days leading up
to her disappearance?

37:57.560 --> 37:59.700
Was she acting out of character?

37:59.700 --> 38:02.100
- Oh, you know, she was
pretty normal, actually.

38:03.390 --> 38:07.400
- She had a date, though,
that she was going on.

38:07.400 --> 38:08.802
You know, so...

38:08.802 --> 38:10.700
(slams flowers)
good for them.

38:10.700 --> 38:13.400
- Yeah? Did you get
his name by any chance?

38:13.400 --> 38:15.610
- No, but she had a lot of dates,

38:15.610 --> 38:19.170
so it wasn't anything unusual, you know.

38:19.170 --> 38:20.270
None of them were me, though,

38:20.270 --> 38:23.147
'cause that would be unprofessional.

38:23.147 --> 38:25.260
(tool bangs)

38:25.260 --> 38:27.010
- Right.

38:27.010 --> 38:27.963
- And she said no.

38:29.310 --> 38:31.680
- So you don't know anything about...

38:31.680 --> 38:34.450
who he was or maybe what he did?

38:34.450 --> 38:35.283
- No.

38:35.283 --> 38:37.253
I mean, I saw a picture of him though.

38:38.400 --> 38:41.310
- Really? Could you describe him for me?

38:41.310 --> 38:45.710
- He was a pretty average
looking guy, reddish brown hair.

38:45.710 --> 38:47.533
Pretty average height.

38:49.370 --> 38:50.203
Basic build.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.560
I do not remember the color of his eyes.

38:54.950 --> 38:56.670
- Very descriptive.

38:56.670 --> 38:57.630
- Brian!

38:57.630 --> 38:58.867
Get back to work!

38:58.867 --> 38:59.760
(sighs)

38:59.760 --> 39:02.030
- Well, hey, I gotta get back to it.

39:02.030 --> 39:05.390
Listen, be sure if you
write about the murders

39:05.390 --> 39:07.400
and everything that you
mention the name of this shop,

39:07.400 --> 39:08.233
all right?

39:08.233 --> 39:11.050
It would be really super
helpful for business.

39:11.050 --> 39:12.593
All right?

39:12.593 --> 39:15.010
(chattering)

39:20.352 --> 39:22.852
(eerie music)

39:28.272 --> 39:31.772
(computer mouse clicking)

39:53.290 --> 39:54.203
- Poor girl.

39:55.411 --> 39:58.911
(somber orchestral music)

40:32.030 --> 40:35.020
- I'm just so happy that you're here

40:35.020 --> 40:37.340
and that we get to have this together

40:37.340 --> 40:39.540
without somebody
constantly interrupting us.

40:40.660 --> 40:41.963
That's probably too much.

40:42.920 --> 40:44.280
I feel like we connect, you know?

40:44.280 --> 40:47.238
Like you really see me...

40:47.238 --> 40:49.281
in a way that other people don't.

40:49.281 --> 40:51.700
(disturbing music)

40:51.700 --> 40:52.533
Holly...

40:53.370 --> 40:56.544
would you like to stay here with me?

40:56.544 --> 40:57.620
(phone beeps)

40:57.620 --> 40:58.453
One sec.

41:24.490 --> 41:25.393
Just a work thing.

41:27.115 --> 41:28.638
What were you saying?

41:28.638 --> 41:31.904
(soft orchestral music)

41:31.904 --> 41:32.737
Right.

41:39.317 --> 41:41.984
(ominous music)

41:48.120 --> 41:48.953
- Okay, check it out.

41:48.953 --> 41:52.380
These are all photos from
Heather Beech's social accounts.

41:52.380 --> 41:53.820
What do you see?

41:53.820 --> 41:56.120
- A bar mitzvah.

41:56.120 --> 41:58.063
- Cute lady and her nephew?

41:59.227 --> 42:01.440
- What about this one? Look close.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.713
- Football and failure.

42:03.850 --> 42:05.010
- I like her top.

42:05.010 --> 42:07.210
- Jesus, Sherlock! The necklace!

42:07.210 --> 42:10.330
Look, she's wearing a necklace
in all of these photos.

42:10.330 --> 42:13.623
Birthdays, New Year's, date night.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.523
They never found that necklace.

42:17.500 --> 42:19.210
- I don't wanna blow your mind right now,

42:19.210 --> 42:21.830
but people do take off their jewelry.

42:21.830 --> 42:24.680
- Yeah, yeah, so what?

42:24.680 --> 42:26.547
- I talked to her family last night.

42:26.547 --> 42:27.960
- You...

42:27.960 --> 42:29.456
You talked to her family?

42:29.456 --> 42:30.289
That's-

42:30.289 --> 42:31.330
- That's not the point.

42:31.330 --> 42:34.040
This isn't just some normal necklace.

42:34.040 --> 42:36.940
Her mother gave it to her before she died.

42:36.940 --> 42:38.910
Why would she stop wearing this necklace

42:38.910 --> 42:40.890
on the night she was murdered?

42:40.890 --> 42:42.730
- I mean, like, I know
you love your bracelet,

42:42.730 --> 42:45.470
but not everybody wears jewelry every day.

42:45.470 --> 42:47.000
- You said it yourself.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.750
He likes something that she's
wearing, and he wants it.

42:50.650 --> 42:52.590
It could be jewelry.

42:52.590 --> 42:54.950
He's taking these things as a trophy.

42:54.950 --> 42:56.240
- What about these stories?

42:56.240 --> 42:58.460
Have you read all of these
or just the ones with photos?

42:58.460 --> 42:59.940
- Okay, assuming that the police

42:59.940 --> 43:02.150
already have all of this information,

43:02.150 --> 43:03.520
what does your discovery mean

43:03.520 --> 43:05.510
for what we're doing right now?

43:05.510 --> 43:06.840
- I was thinking...

43:06.840 --> 43:09.230
maybe we try to tackle this
from a different angle.

43:09.230 --> 43:10.290
- Okay.

43:10.290 --> 43:12.993
- Instead of the dark and
brooding silent killer,

43:14.140 --> 43:15.973
what if we kick it up a notch?

43:16.880 --> 43:19.483
Maybe he's charismatic, a little flashy.

43:20.380 --> 43:22.000
Woos women?

43:22.000 --> 43:24.053
Takes the jury as trophies.

43:25.160 --> 43:27.393
- So like if Batman were a criminal.

43:28.970 --> 43:30.570
- Batman.

43:30.570 --> 43:33.170
Robin's lame.

43:33.170 --> 43:34.810
- I just don't know that
people are gonna wanna watch

43:34.810 --> 43:36.690
a movie about a rich, good-looking guy

43:36.690 --> 43:39.210
literally getting away with murder.

43:39.210 --> 43:41.540
- You wanna know what I think?

43:41.540 --> 43:43.590
I think you're jealous.

43:43.590 --> 43:45.390
You come in here thinking
you know everything

43:45.390 --> 43:47.170
about serial killers and murderers.

43:47.170 --> 43:48.080
But you know what?

43:49.030 --> 43:52.330
Captain true crime
didn't come up with shit!

43:52.330 --> 43:53.820
- Fuck you, Seth!

43:53.820 --> 43:54.810
- Fuck me!

43:54.810 --> 43:57.470
- Yeah. I'm sorry I
didn't get any great info

43:57.470 --> 43:59.710
from her coworkers she barely talked to.

43:59.710 --> 44:02.750
I didn't get all invasive with her family.

44:02.750 --> 44:05.180
You know, you're a
well-dressed, good-looking guy.

44:05.180 --> 44:07.010
Do you care if we go
rifle through your room

44:07.010 --> 44:08.294
and see what you're hanging on to?

44:08.294 --> 44:09.133
- You know what?
- Guys, guys, just calm down.

44:09.133 --> 44:11.210
- I stuck my neck out for you!

44:11.210 --> 44:12.820
- To who? Yourself?

44:12.820 --> 44:13.710
- Oh, please!

44:13.710 --> 44:15.370
Look, I've seen your book numbers.

44:15.370 --> 44:17.483
You need this just as bad as I do.

44:18.370 --> 44:19.946
- This is bullshit.

44:19.946 --> 44:21.946
(sighs)

44:27.846 --> 44:30.714
(door slams)

44:30.714 --> 44:32.714
(sighs)

44:34.804 --> 44:37.417
- I'm gonna end up just like you.

44:37.417 --> 44:42.417
(emotional music)
(birds whistling)

45:08.466 --> 45:09.299
Hey.

45:10.286 --> 45:11.700
- Hey.

45:11.700 --> 45:12.617
- You okay?

45:14.404 --> 45:15.821
- Yeah, I'm okay.

45:23.547 --> 45:24.533
What's that?

45:26.130 --> 45:27.430
- Indirect peace offering?

45:34.360 --> 45:35.193
- Well, I wouldn't have said no

45:35.193 --> 45:38.510
to something stronger
than water, but thanks.

45:38.510 --> 45:39.343
- Yeah.

45:41.320 --> 45:43.720
Stuff got pretty heated in there.

45:43.720 --> 45:45.050
- I know. I'm...

45:46.727 --> 45:48.250
I'm sorry about the whole tantrum.

45:48.250 --> 45:52.893
He just seems to have a unique
ability to push my buttons.

45:55.280 --> 45:56.900
- Do you guys have a...

45:56.900 --> 45:57.770
Like a past?

45:57.770 --> 45:59.390
Maybe you dated?

45:59.390 --> 46:00.660
- No!

46:00.660 --> 46:01.850
No, we just...

46:02.790 --> 46:05.973
fundamentally disagree about
how to tell this story.

46:07.140 --> 46:08.400
- Right.

46:08.400 --> 46:10.200
- I mean, I knew there would
be creative differences,

46:10.200 --> 46:12.093
but not like this.

46:13.994 --> 46:15.680
I was already iffy about...

46:16.810 --> 46:20.030
bringing fame and notoriety
to this person anyway.

46:20.030 --> 46:22.520
And now we're talking about glamorizing

46:22.520 --> 46:24.033
what this sicko's doing?

46:26.240 --> 46:27.880
- Well...

46:27.880 --> 46:31.070
I mean, before you said it
was really interesting, right?

46:31.070 --> 46:32.540
- Yeah, it's interesting.

46:32.540 --> 46:35.883
But that doesn't make
it good or sympathetic.

46:40.340 --> 46:41.173
- Yeah.

46:42.210 --> 46:45.420
- I just think it could
be really harmful to...

46:46.260 --> 46:51.130
portray this killer as a hot, cool guy.

46:51.130 --> 46:52.860
I know that they think

46:52.860 --> 46:55.570
that they're doing something important

46:55.570 --> 46:58.621
or maybe even artistic with
this, but they're not there.

46:58.621 --> 47:00.650
They're just killing people.

47:00.650 --> 47:03.760
- What about the whole
gray area in writing,

47:03.760 --> 47:07.410
where characters aren't all
good or all bad, you know?

47:07.410 --> 47:09.940
- Right, but there is still
good and there is still bad.

47:09.940 --> 47:13.990
And I think the good are
the people that were killed.

47:13.990 --> 47:15.550
You know, they should
be living their lives

47:15.550 --> 47:17.580
but that chance was taken away from them

47:17.580 --> 47:20.913
by this person for their
own twisted reasons.

47:20.913 --> 47:22.490
(tense music)
It's not cool.

47:22.490 --> 47:23.360
It's not glamorous.

47:23.360 --> 47:25.230
It's sick. It's obsessive.

47:25.230 --> 47:26.581
They are a murderer!

47:26.581 --> 47:27.414
(cup crunches)
(water splashing)

47:27.414 --> 47:28.730
Shit!

47:28.730 --> 47:30.780
Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry!

47:30.780 --> 47:31.840
Shit!

47:31.840 --> 47:33.420
Yeah, yeah.

47:33.420 --> 47:34.900
- You are soaked!

47:34.900 --> 47:35.733
- I'm sorry.

47:35.733 --> 47:38.130
- Should we just call it for the day?

47:38.130 --> 47:39.090
Do you need to go home?

47:39.090 --> 47:40.250
- No. I...

47:41.750 --> 47:45.650
In my line of work, you need
to keep extra clothes on hand,

47:45.650 --> 47:47.040
so I can change.

47:47.040 --> 47:48.030
It's fine.

47:48.030 --> 47:48.863
- Okay.

47:51.270 --> 47:52.103
Go for it.

47:52.103 --> 47:52.936
- Sorry.

47:52.936 --> 47:55.250
- Yeah, I'll just take
a minute to cool down,

47:55.250 --> 47:56.600
and then we can go back in.

47:59.460 --> 48:01.504
Promise not to peak!

48:01.504 --> 48:04.337
(emotional music)

48:26.235 --> 48:28.235
(sighs)

48:38.540 --> 48:39.373
You ready?

48:41.320 --> 48:42.153
- Yeah.

48:44.296 --> 48:47.046
(car door shuts)

48:50.109 --> 48:52.109
(sighs)

48:53.386 --> 48:55.803
(door opens)

49:11.170 --> 49:12.003
- So...

49:12.920 --> 49:14.433
I regret some things.

49:16.170 --> 49:18.883
I'm sorry about what I
said. I was way out of line.

49:20.320 --> 49:24.683
To be completely honest, it's
not even really accurate.

49:26.100 --> 49:28.713
I actually did research your book sales.

49:30.960 --> 49:31.863
Pretty damn good.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.800
Better than anything I've ever done.

49:37.720 --> 49:38.553
Mark...

49:40.320 --> 49:43.500
did you know that we are
currently working with a member

49:43.500 --> 49:48.500
of John Anderson's top 200
true crime authors of 2020?

49:49.270 --> 49:50.750
- Yeah.

49:50.750 --> 49:52.940
- Did you already know that about me,

49:52.940 --> 49:55.600
or did you look it up when
I was outside just now?

49:55.600 --> 49:56.930
- Does that really matter a little yet?

49:56.930 --> 49:58.243
- A little, yes!

49:58.243 --> 49:59.160
- Whatever.

50:00.110 --> 50:01.693
- So where has this Seth been?

50:02.680 --> 50:04.007
- Under a lot of stress.

50:04.007 --> 50:04.840
(soft music)

50:04.840 --> 50:07.670
- Well, I like him. He's very charming.

50:07.670 --> 50:10.493
Well, I like him. He's
very charming, charming.

50:10.493 --> 50:13.410
(disturbing music)

50:57.860 --> 51:00.313
I need to be receptive to
ideas that aren't mine.

51:02.350 --> 51:03.520
I'm sorry.

51:03.520 --> 51:05.560
And it was really fucked up

51:05.560 --> 51:07.080
to imply that you were a murderer.

51:07.080 --> 51:08.760
I don't even know where that came from.

51:08.760 --> 51:11.760
- I mean, I do kind of look the part.

51:11.760 --> 51:13.970
- Well, you do dress really well.

51:13.970 --> 51:15.270
Okay.

51:15.270 --> 51:18.393
So, tell me about your
charming, magnetic killer.

51:19.770 --> 51:21.463
- How about I show you?

51:22.650 --> 51:23.990
- An act out?

51:23.990 --> 51:24.823
- Act out!

51:27.270 --> 51:29.920
I've been thinking about
this one for a little while.

51:31.418 --> 51:32.523
This here.

51:34.460 --> 51:36.130
Just a second.

51:36.130 --> 51:37.013
Just a second.

51:40.440 --> 51:41.500
Holly?

51:41.500 --> 51:44.290
- No! Why do I always
have to be the victim?

51:44.290 --> 51:46.500
- Do you really need to ask that?

51:46.500 --> 51:48.470
Holly? Flower names?

51:48.470 --> 51:50.220
Serial killer?

51:50.220 --> 51:52.010
- Holly is not a flower. It's a plant.

51:52.010 --> 51:53.073
- Close enough.

51:54.330 --> 51:55.600
- Mark!

51:55.600 --> 51:56.850
You haven't done one yet.

51:57.860 --> 51:59.420
Grab a seat.

51:59.420 --> 52:01.230
- I'm good, thanks. No.

52:01.230 --> 52:02.110
- Come on, man.

52:02.110 --> 52:04.700
- Be a team player! We're on a team now.

52:04.700 --> 52:05.533
- Go team!

52:07.003 --> 52:09.003
(sighs)

52:14.780 --> 52:15.920
Okay.

52:15.920 --> 52:17.219
All right.

52:17.219 --> 52:21.530
In this scenario, our killer
has our victim in a chair,

52:21.530 --> 52:23.173
hands tied behind their back.

52:25.304 --> 52:26.254
Behind on the back.

52:27.260 --> 52:28.138
Come on.

52:28.138 --> 52:29.300
(soft music)

52:29.300 --> 52:30.133
All right.

52:31.470 --> 52:35.553
So at this point, our victim is terrified.

52:36.670 --> 52:37.503
Alone.

52:38.850 --> 52:40.650
She doesn't know what's coming next.

52:43.070 --> 52:45.130
Is he making an advance?

52:45.130 --> 52:46.690
- Okay! Can we stop?

52:46.690 --> 52:48.650
Is that really necessary?

52:48.650 --> 52:50.523
- Your hands are supposed to be tied up.

52:51.524 --> 52:53.174
- Come on, man. Behind your back.

52:55.150 --> 52:55.983
- Okay.

52:57.740 --> 52:58.940
- All right.

52:58.940 --> 52:59.960
As I was saying...

53:01.890 --> 53:03.820
is he making an advance...

53:04.820 --> 53:05.960
or...

53:05.960 --> 53:07.694
is he just gonna blow
his fucking brains out?

53:07.694 --> 53:09.675
- Whoa!
- What the fuck?

53:09.675 --> 53:11.170
Is this real?

53:11.170 --> 53:12.380
- Why would I have a fake gun?

53:12.380 --> 53:13.430
- [Holly] Is it loaded?

53:13.430 --> 53:14.970
- No, it's not loaded!

53:14.970 --> 53:16.500
- What do you even have that?

53:16.500 --> 53:19.480
- Um, there's a murderer on the loose.

53:19.480 --> 53:23.380
- Don't point guns at
your friends, you weirdo!

53:23.380 --> 53:26.260
- You're right, you're right. I'm sorry.

53:26.260 --> 53:29.180
But did you see the look on his face?

53:29.180 --> 53:31.640
He didn't know what was gonna happen next!

53:31.640 --> 53:33.390
- You were pretty scared.

53:33.390 --> 53:35.290
- Yeah, there was a gun.

53:35.290 --> 53:36.763
- Damn near pissed his pants.

53:38.650 --> 53:40.600
- Are we done? Is that it?

53:40.600 --> 53:42.300
- So how are you feeling about it?

53:43.210 --> 53:45.530
I feel like you watched a lot of movies

53:45.530 --> 53:46.710
over the last 20 years,

53:46.710 --> 53:48.940
you regurgitated them into this cliche,

53:48.940 --> 53:49.970
and we just did that.

53:49.970 --> 53:53.491
It's like an animal with no
brain trying to create art.

53:53.491 --> 53:54.324
- Okay.

53:54.324 --> 53:55.980
- Wow.

53:55.980 --> 53:59.010
Well, you know, you're a big guy

53:59.010 --> 54:01.410
sitting in his friend's living room.

54:01.410 --> 54:03.440
You've got to put yourself
in the state of mind

54:03.440 --> 54:05.260
of one of these victims.

54:05.260 --> 54:08.740
You are a bright, accomplished young woman

54:08.740 --> 54:11.090
with people who love her.

54:11.090 --> 54:12.790
You should have your
whole life ahead of you,

54:12.790 --> 54:15.610
but you put your trust
in the wrong person,

54:15.610 --> 54:20.610
and now your whole life is
in the hands of this monster.

54:20.810 --> 54:21.760
- Damn you're good.

54:25.670 --> 54:26.830
- Okay.

54:26.830 --> 54:28.110
Sure.

54:28.110 --> 54:29.610
- So...

54:29.610 --> 54:30.443
try again.

54:30.443 --> 54:31.950
Think like that.

54:31.950 --> 54:32.800
- All right then.

54:33.830 --> 54:34.980
Hands behind your back.

54:38.220 --> 54:39.660
As I was saying...

54:41.750 --> 54:46.750
he's had this victim for
weeks, living off scraps.

54:47.190 --> 54:49.933
She's hungry, weak.

54:51.430 --> 54:53.813
Not knowing what's coming next.

54:54.760 --> 54:59.500
Her dreams, her aspirations
all fading away...

54:59.500 --> 55:02.140
all with just a tight squeeze.

55:02.140 --> 55:04.630
- Stop, stop, stop! Okay?

55:04.630 --> 55:08.980
Take a fucking second and
do something that matters!

55:08.980 --> 55:11.320
You're not accomplishing anything!

55:11.320 --> 55:12.780
What are you doing? Are
you gonna be in the movie?

55:12.780 --> 55:15.460
Why are we doing this? Are you acting?

55:15.460 --> 55:17.280
We're just spinning our tires!

55:17.280 --> 55:18.780
How many times have we met up?

55:19.650 --> 55:22.070
I'm gonna take a second
and leave and do something

55:22.070 --> 55:24.770
to actually help us push
this story forward, you know,

55:24.770 --> 55:25.603
figure something out.

55:25.603 --> 55:26.630
If you guys wanna do the same,

55:26.630 --> 55:29.110
maybe you should do that and
we can get something done.

55:29.110 --> 55:30.110
Okay?

55:30.110 --> 55:32.253
I'm sorry. I just, I gotta go.

55:36.882 --> 55:38.890
- Was it something I said?

55:38.890 --> 55:40.423
- You pointed a gun at him!

55:41.620 --> 55:42.453
- Too much?

55:46.424 --> 55:48.924
(eerie music)

56:02.887 --> 56:05.887
(crickets chirping)

56:07.217 --> 56:10.050
(startling music)

56:31.295 --> 56:33.050
- Oh! (laughs)

56:33.050 --> 56:33.960
You must be Mark.

56:33.960 --> 56:34.970
- Yeah. Daisy?

56:34.970 --> 56:36.780
- Yeah, it's nice to meet you!

56:36.780 --> 56:38.400
- Yeah, you too.

56:38.400 --> 56:39.233
You...

56:39.233 --> 56:40.553
- Yeah, you wanna sit down?

56:41.450 --> 56:44.560
- So, this is a nice park.

56:44.560 --> 56:47.143
- It's really nice. It's
been a beautiful day.

56:48.150 --> 56:50.917
- You would think. You would think.

56:50.917 --> 56:53.060
- Did you have a rough day?

56:53.060 --> 56:56.370
- Yeah, work stuff. It was kinda bad.

56:56.370 --> 56:57.203
- I hear ya.

56:57.203 --> 56:58.484
Yeah, work. Ugh.

56:58.484 --> 56:59.317
(laughs)

56:59.317 --> 57:00.850
- What do you do?

57:00.850 --> 57:04.290
- I am an art teacher
for middle schoolers.

57:04.290 --> 57:05.123
- Wow!

57:05.123 --> 57:05.970
- Mm-hm.

57:05.970 --> 57:06.960
- That must be...

57:08.220 --> 57:09.053
unbearable.

57:11.230 --> 57:12.170
- Um...

57:13.679 --> 57:14.910
not really.

57:14.910 --> 57:17.950
I mean, I love to teach
art, and I love kids,

57:17.950 --> 57:19.530
so it's been...

57:19.530 --> 57:20.500
It's pretty fulfilling.

57:20.500 --> 57:23.770
It can have its challenges
though. Definitely.

57:23.770 --> 57:26.670
- I'm actually pretty
creative myself, I guess.

57:26.670 --> 57:27.797
I'm a photographer.

57:27.797 --> 57:28.630
- Oh!

57:28.630 --> 57:30.490
- And I work on some film
projects here and there,

57:30.490 --> 57:32.014
getting into that.

57:32.014 --> 57:34.600
- Wow! That sounds like fun.

57:34.600 --> 57:35.870
- Well, sometimes.

57:35.870 --> 57:38.790
I actually had a meeting
today that kind of went crazy,

57:38.790 --> 57:40.490
like I was saying.

57:40.490 --> 57:43.320
They won't really listen to
me and take my input on stuff.

57:43.320 --> 57:45.980
And it's actually a topic
that I know all about

57:45.980 --> 57:47.440
and they won't even recognize that

57:47.440 --> 57:49.220
and listen to what I have to say.

57:49.220 --> 57:50.810
And it gets really frustrating,

57:50.810 --> 57:53.010
and I'm not really sure
what to do about it.

57:54.880 --> 57:55.713
I don't know.

57:55.713 --> 57:56.800
I'm rambling though. Sorry.

57:56.800 --> 58:00.060
- Well, I mean, it's hard
when you're not heard.

58:00.060 --> 58:01.190
I can understand that.

58:01.190 --> 58:02.410
And don't worry about the rambling.

58:02.410 --> 58:04.380
I'm pretty nervous myself.

58:04.380 --> 58:05.683
This is my first time.

58:06.760 --> 58:07.880
- On a date?

58:07.880 --> 58:09.490
- Oh, well...

58:09.490 --> 58:13.380
My first time on a date app.

58:13.380 --> 58:15.730
I was in this long-term relationship.

58:15.730 --> 58:17.680
It just didn't work out.

58:17.680 --> 58:18.620
It's been a long time,

58:18.620 --> 58:22.800
and my best friend pretty
much pushed me into this.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.730
- I actually have the same
kind of problem going on.

58:24.730 --> 58:26.000
There's this girl that I'm working with,

58:26.000 --> 58:27.350
the thing from today.

58:27.350 --> 58:30.260
Like, she really sees me
for me, which is impossible.

58:30.260 --> 58:31.340
So it was so great!

58:31.340 --> 58:33.620
And I really feel like
she could be the one.

58:33.620 --> 58:35.270
But suddenly I find out

58:35.270 --> 58:37.173
she's going behind my
back right in front of me

58:37.173 --> 58:38.630
with this douche bag named Seth,

58:38.630 --> 58:39.822
and I don't know what to do.

58:39.822 --> 58:40.790
Like, that really...

58:40.790 --> 58:41.900
It hurts!

58:41.900 --> 58:43.357
- [Daisy] Yeah, I'm sure.

58:43.357 --> 58:44.690
I'm sure that was heartbreaking.

58:44.690 --> 58:46.173
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.

58:47.060 --> 58:50.370
- So is this someone
you're currently seeing?

58:50.370 --> 58:52.793
I mean, are y'all still in contact?

58:58.550 --> 59:00.773
- Not at the moment, it seems.

59:02.670 --> 59:03.950
This is going well!

59:03.950 --> 59:05.010
You wanna get outta here?

59:05.010 --> 59:05.843
- Um...

59:05.843 --> 59:07.470
Well, you know...

59:07.470 --> 59:08.390
Really...

59:09.988 --> 59:11.230
Oh my gosh!

59:11.230 --> 59:13.780
My babysitter has to leave in 30 minutes.

59:13.780 --> 59:16.370
She got school tomorrow,
so I really can't.

59:16.370 --> 59:17.257
What are you doing?
- It won't take long.

59:17.257 --> 59:18.090
(ominous music)

59:18.090 --> 59:18.923
- Let go of me!

59:18.923 --> 59:20.163
- Just come. Come on.

59:20.163 --> 59:20.996
Just-
(purse thuds)

59:20.996 --> 59:22.413
- Fuckin' weirdo!

59:28.281 --> 59:33.281
(sighs)
(phone beeps)

59:33.558 --> 59:36.225
(ominous music)

59:55.326 --> 59:58.159
(birds whistling)

1:00:01.869 --> 1:00:04.286
(soft music)

1:01:19.248 --> 1:01:21.748
(phone beeps)

1:01:47.527 --> 1:01:50.027
(phone beeps)

1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:28.500
(phone beeps)

1:02:38.343 --> 1:02:40.926
(slams jacket)

1:02:57.344 --> 1:03:00.011
(anxious music)

1:03:14.105 --> 1:03:16.772
(clock ticking)

1:03:55.536 --> 1:03:57.623
(sniffling)

1:03:57.623 --> 1:04:01.013
(feet shuffling)

1:04:01.013 --> 1:04:02.426
(metal plunks)

1:04:02.426 --> 1:04:03.426
- So stupid!

1:04:05.987 --> 1:04:07.627
You're a sick...

1:04:07.627 --> 1:04:08.460
(banging head)

1:04:08.460 --> 1:04:10.380
stupid...

1:04:10.380 --> 1:04:11.623
twisted...

1:04:11.623 --> 1:04:12.456
freak.

1:04:14.691 --> 1:04:17.155
Everybody was right.
You're not gonna change.

1:04:17.155 --> 1:04:19.678
You're not gonna be somebody else.

1:04:19.678 --> 1:04:23.524
(emotional orchestral music)

1:04:23.524 --> 1:04:24.357
(crying)

1:04:24.357 --> 1:04:25.930
Gonna lose her!

1:04:25.930 --> 1:04:28.573
He's filling her head with all this shit!

1:04:29.810 --> 1:04:31.460
She's gonna go.

1:04:31.460 --> 1:04:34.460
(breathing heavily)

1:04:35.571 --> 1:04:37.954
(eerie music)

1:04:37.954 --> 1:04:38.787
Unless...

1:04:42.396 --> 1:04:43.850
Unless I make a gesture.

1:04:43.850 --> 1:04:44.800
Do you think...

1:04:47.670 --> 1:04:49.033
if I gave her that?

1:04:49.990 --> 1:04:51.280
I know that it's special to you,

1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:55.953
but she's so special to me, and
I just have to do something.

1:04:57.545 --> 1:05:01.295
(emotional orchestral music)

1:05:05.899 --> 1:05:06.732
Yeah?

1:05:10.801 --> 1:05:13.468
(ominous music)

1:05:21.394 --> 1:05:24.061
(crying softly)

1:05:25.722 --> 1:05:26.555
Thank you.

1:05:41.063 --> 1:05:43.230
(ticking)

1:05:58.496 --> 1:06:01.413
(knocking on door)

1:06:05.970 --> 1:06:06.803
- Mark!

1:06:06.803 --> 1:06:07.636
What's up, man?

1:06:07.636 --> 1:06:08.743
- Hey.
- You busy?

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:11.090
- Yeah, actually...

1:06:12.270 --> 1:06:13.550
Yeah.

1:06:13.550 --> 1:06:17.250
- Well, I was just in the
neighborhood and was wondering

1:06:17.250 --> 1:06:20.200
if you had some time to
talk about a few shots.

1:06:20.200 --> 1:06:22.690
- Yeah, um...

1:06:22.690 --> 1:06:23.890
Okay. Yeah.

1:06:23.890 --> 1:06:25.120
- I mean, I know we're meeting tomorrow,

1:06:25.120 --> 1:06:27.560
but I feel like if I bring
it up in front of Holly,

1:06:27.560 --> 1:06:30.610
she's just gonna shoot
me down anyway, you know?

1:06:30.610 --> 1:06:33.490
- She won't listen to
anything I have to say.

1:06:33.490 --> 1:06:35.003
You know I have good ideas.

1:06:35.840 --> 1:06:38.390
Think about the commercial
we shot a few months back.

1:06:38.390 --> 1:06:39.610
My idea.

1:06:39.610 --> 1:06:41.950
Revenues 50% up.

1:06:41.950 --> 1:06:43.580
- Yeah, it was good.

1:06:43.580 --> 1:06:45.766
I thought you did a good job with that.

1:06:45.766 --> 1:06:47.360
(soft music)

1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:49.950
Do you think it's a good idea
to be out here right now?

1:06:49.950 --> 1:06:51.300
Is it safe with everything?

1:06:52.320 --> 1:06:54.280
- Unless your name's Lily or Rose,

1:06:54.280 --> 1:06:56.270
I don't think I have much to worry about.

1:06:56.270 --> 1:06:57.600
Plus...

1:06:57.600 --> 1:06:59.126
I've got a little extra protection.

1:06:59.126 --> 1:07:01.960
(anxious music)

1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:02.793
- Yeah.

1:07:03.790 --> 1:07:05.340
- That your shop?

1:07:05.340 --> 1:07:07.750
I didn't know you were a car guy.

1:07:07.750 --> 1:07:10.724
- No. That was my stepdad's.

1:07:10.724 --> 1:07:14.053
- Your stepdad owns a
shop in your backyard?

1:07:15.560 --> 1:07:16.393
- He's dead.

1:07:18.970 --> 1:07:21.900
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

1:07:21.900 --> 1:07:23.250
I didn't know.

1:07:23.250 --> 1:07:24.083
- It's nothing.

1:07:27.440 --> 1:07:29.980
Why don't we go check out this...

1:07:31.130 --> 1:07:33.853
location that I saw the
other day, this cool spot.

1:07:35.450 --> 1:07:36.850
Maybe you'll like it. I can get my camera.

1:07:36.850 --> 1:07:37.935
We can take some shots if you want.

1:07:37.935 --> 1:07:38.768
- Yeah.

1:07:38.768 --> 1:07:39.890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:07:39.890 --> 1:07:40.820
That sounds like a good idea.

1:07:40.820 --> 1:07:42.250
Is it around here?

1:07:42.250 --> 1:07:43.670
- Yeah, it's close. Yeah.

1:07:43.670 --> 1:07:44.580
I'll get my camera.

1:07:44.580 --> 1:07:46.630
- Yeah, yeah. I'll wait inside.

1:07:46.630 --> 1:07:49.397
- Just hang out out here though.

1:07:49.397 --> 1:07:51.930
It's kind of a mess.
There's a lot of garbage.

1:07:51.930 --> 1:07:52.763
- Yeah.

1:07:52.763 --> 1:07:54.150
- It's just kinda smelly.
It's embarrassing.

1:07:54.150 --> 1:07:54.990
- No problem.

1:07:54.990 --> 1:07:56.740
- All right. I'll be right back.

1:07:56.740 --> 1:07:57.573
- Yeah.

1:08:00.440 --> 1:08:01.640
Hey, you dropped your...

1:08:03.697 --> 1:08:07.438
(mysterious music)

1:08:07.438 --> 1:08:10.188
(dramatic music)

1:08:27.551 --> 1:08:28.810
(door opens)

1:08:28.810 --> 1:08:29.643
- All right.

1:08:29.643 --> 1:08:30.476
- Hey, look...

1:08:31.630 --> 1:08:35.043
It was rude of me to come
over tonight unannounced.

1:08:36.270 --> 1:08:38.670
We can pick back up on
this tomorrow, all right?

1:08:40.540 --> 1:08:42.330
- Okay. Yeah.

1:08:42.330 --> 1:08:45.060
- We've got a busy day. Don't wanna...

1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:48.274
- Yeah, sure.

1:08:48.274 --> 1:08:49.191
- Tomorrow.

1:08:57.331 --> 1:09:00.081
(dramatic music)

1:09:30.794 --> 1:09:33.211
(car starts)

1:10:07.689 --> 1:10:10.356
(phone ringing)

1:10:11.398 --> 1:10:12.340
- [Holly] Hey, what's up?

1:10:12.340 --> 1:10:14.463
- Hey, can you come meet me now?

1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:17.400
- [Holly] Right now?

1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:21.098
- Yeah, there's something I
need to talk to you about.

1:10:21.098 --> 1:10:22.630
- [Holly] Everything okay?

1:10:22.630 --> 1:10:24.343
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:10:25.320 --> 1:10:28.493
I'm at a location I was showing
Seth. I can drop you a pin.

1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:30.850
- [Holly] In town?

1:10:30.850 --> 1:10:31.850
- Yeah, not too far.

1:10:33.675 --> 1:10:37.466
- [Holly] Okay, yeah. Give
me about five minutes.

1:10:37.466 --> 1:10:39.030
- Okay.

1:10:39.030 --> 1:10:41.113
- I'll see you soon. Bye.

1:10:51.311 --> 1:10:54.311
(suspenseful music)

1:11:27.174 --> 1:11:28.007
Mark?

1:11:29.604 --> 1:11:32.271
(anxious music)

1:11:37.235 --> 1:11:38.068
Mark?

1:11:44.801 --> 1:11:47.468
(phone beeping)

1:11:49.670 --> 1:11:52.337
(ominous music)

1:11:54.391 --> 1:11:55.224
Shit!

1:11:56.823 --> 1:11:59.490
(phone beeping)

1:12:07.330 --> 1:12:08.905
(dramatic music)

1:12:08.905 --> 1:12:11.572
(Holly screams)

1:12:15.443 --> 1:12:17.561
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1:12:17.561 --> 1:12:19.633
It's okay. It's okay.

1:12:19.633 --> 1:12:20.466
It's okay.

1:12:29.336 --> 1:12:31.836
(car beeping)

1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:36.313
(emotional music)

1:12:38.785 --> 1:12:40.980
(traffic rushing)

1:12:40.980 --> 1:12:44.480
(rain hitting windshield)

1:13:28.255 --> 1:13:32.258
- What are you doing,
Mark? What are you doing?

1:13:32.258 --> 1:13:34.571
(ticking)

1:13:34.571 --> 1:13:36.988
(soft music)

1:13:44.450 --> 1:13:45.313
- We're home.

1:13:48.750 --> 1:13:50.470
So sorry that I have to do it...

1:13:51.330 --> 1:13:54.350
like this, but I think you're
gonna be really excited

1:13:54.350 --> 1:13:56.040
whenever you see what I'm doing here,

1:13:56.040 --> 1:13:58.650
because I want you to be a
part of the story, all right?

1:13:58.650 --> 1:14:01.050
You're not like the other girls.

1:14:01.050 --> 1:14:03.240
You're different, okay? You're...

1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:04.340
You're special, all right?

1:14:04.340 --> 1:14:07.043
There's something about
you that they don't have.

1:14:07.980 --> 1:14:10.470
And you seem to get me in such a way

1:14:10.470 --> 1:14:12.340
that makes me feel like I'm alive.

1:14:12.340 --> 1:14:15.260
And I just, I want you to know that, okay?

1:14:15.260 --> 1:14:17.239
- Not another step, Mark!

1:14:17.239 --> 1:14:19.120
(tense music)

1:14:19.120 --> 1:14:20.083
- Seth?

1:14:21.730 --> 1:14:22.773
What's going on?

1:14:23.660 --> 1:14:25.660
- Why don't you tell me what's going on.

1:14:27.430 --> 1:14:29.469
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1:14:29.469 --> 1:14:32.290
We were working on the
movie and she got sick.

1:14:32.290 --> 1:14:34.063
- No. No more lies, Mark.

1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:35.793
- I swear!

1:14:35.793 --> 1:14:36.892
If you just let me get
her, she'll tell you.

1:14:36.892 --> 1:14:37.725
- No!

1:14:37.725 --> 1:14:40.283
I said not another step.

1:14:42.620 --> 1:14:43.453
- Okay.

1:14:44.900 --> 1:14:46.200
What do you want me to do?

1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:48.653
- Just back away.

1:14:50.010 --> 1:14:50.843
- Okay.

1:14:55.900 --> 1:14:56.803
- Look, okay.

1:14:57.820 --> 1:14:59.870
I know this looks bad, but it's just...

1:14:59.870 --> 1:15:02.870
It's not what it seems like, okay?

1:15:02.870 --> 1:15:05.011
Just calm down and let me explain.

1:15:05.011 --> 1:15:06.570
- Explain?

1:15:06.570 --> 1:15:08.062
Explain this.

1:15:08.062 --> 1:15:10.433
(dramatic music)

1:15:10.433 --> 1:15:11.320
- What is that?

1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:12.153
- What is that?

1:15:12.153 --> 1:15:13.933
You know exactly what this is, Mark.

1:15:14.850 --> 1:15:16.683
This is Heather Beech's necklace.

1:15:19.210 --> 1:15:20.960
- Where'd you get that?

1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:24.280
- I found it at your house.

1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:27.253
Either you're just
clumsy or really unlucky.

1:15:28.780 --> 1:15:30.950
- You are not seeing the opportunity

1:15:30.950 --> 1:15:32.070
that is in front of you.

1:15:32.070 --> 1:15:34.030
There is so much you could learn here,

1:15:34.030 --> 1:15:35.500
so much that you could use for the movie.

1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:37.370
It's sincere. It's real, okay.

1:15:37.370 --> 1:15:38.610
It'll be authentic.

1:15:38.610 --> 1:15:40.820
- Okay, yeah. Maybe I
should be thanking you.

1:15:40.820 --> 1:15:42.410
You know, I was starting to worry

1:15:42.410 --> 1:15:44.560
about the ending of our little flick.

1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:47.273
Never thought I'd be the
hero of my own movie.

1:15:47.273 --> 1:15:49.273
Yet here you come with a little twist.

1:15:50.528 --> 1:15:52.460
I wonder who they'd get to play me.

1:15:52.460 --> 1:15:54.250
- Okay, I know it looks like

1:15:54.250 --> 1:15:55.970
you don't have any choices here.

1:15:55.970 --> 1:16:00.170
It's an odd situation, but you
just need to take a second.

1:16:00.170 --> 1:16:01.910
You don't have to do this, okay?

1:16:01.910 --> 1:16:03.760
You don't have to do
this. Just take a second.

1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:04.593
(Holly grunts)
(slam)

1:16:04.593 --> 1:16:05.826
(dramatic music)

1:16:05.826 --> 1:16:08.826
(breathing heavily)

1:16:10.443 --> 1:16:12.380
(tool clanking)

1:16:12.380 --> 1:16:13.490
Holly?

1:16:13.490 --> 1:16:15.040
- He was pointing a gun at you.

1:16:16.080 --> 1:16:18.960
He was pointing a gun at
you, so I had to hit him.

1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:20.253
Oh my God! Is he okay?

1:16:21.824 --> 1:16:23.380
- He's not breathing.

1:16:23.380 --> 1:16:24.540
- Oh my God! I can't...

1:16:25.532 --> 1:16:26.990
Oh my God.

1:16:26.990 --> 1:16:28.720
Oh my God, but he had...

1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:30.810
He had that necklace
he kept talking about!

1:16:30.810 --> 1:16:33.520
It was Seth the whole time?

1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:36.413
He was trying to get us
to make a movie about him!

1:16:38.300 --> 1:16:39.550
Where's my phone?

1:16:39.550 --> 1:16:40.730
I need a phone! I need a phone!

1:16:40.730 --> 1:16:43.990
We need to call the police!
We need to call the police!

1:16:43.990 --> 1:16:46.120
I just killed someone.

1:16:46.120 --> 1:16:48.460
We need to do something. I killed someone.

1:16:48.460 --> 1:16:50.140
I just killed someone!

1:16:50.140 --> 1:16:51.134
We have to do something!

1:16:51.134 --> 1:16:52.400
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- No, no, no, no, no!

1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:53.900
I just killed somebody!

1:16:53.900 --> 1:16:55.304
- Okay, okay.

1:16:55.304 --> 1:16:56.137
- It's not okay!

1:16:56.137 --> 1:16:57.090
- Yes, yes, yes, it's fine.

1:16:57.090 --> 1:16:59.750
- I killed someone! You
don't know how that feels!

1:16:59.750 --> 1:17:01.300
We need to call the police!

1:17:01.300 --> 1:17:03.210
I have to call my boyfriend!

1:17:03.210 --> 1:17:04.897
We have to call someone!

1:17:04.897 --> 1:17:06.900
(soft music)

1:17:06.900 --> 1:17:07.780
- What? You have to-

1:17:07.780 --> 1:17:09.210
- I left right after you called me.

1:17:09.210 --> 1:17:10.970
He doesn't even know where I am right now!

1:17:10.970 --> 1:17:13.490
And we need to get the police
here! Maybe an ambulance!

1:17:13.490 --> 1:17:16.223
We need to do something, Mark! Oh my God!

1:17:17.390 --> 1:17:18.300
Can you just...

1:17:18.300 --> 1:17:20.750
Can you get a phone, please?

1:17:20.750 --> 1:17:22.790
Please, can you get help?

1:17:22.790 --> 1:17:23.623
- Yeah.

1:17:24.744 --> 1:17:25.577
- Thank you.

1:17:25.577 --> 1:17:27.004
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1:17:27.004 --> 1:17:27.837
- I'll...

1:17:27.837 --> 1:17:29.710
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

1:17:29.710 --> 1:17:30.543
- I'll get the car.

1:17:30.543 --> 1:17:33.014
I'll get the car and bring
the car around, okay?

1:17:33.014 --> 1:17:34.251
- Okay.

1:17:34.251 --> 1:17:35.357
(crying)

1:17:35.357 --> 1:17:37.963
And I'm gonna check, and maybe he's okay.

1:17:39.322 --> 1:17:40.293
It was a mistake.

1:17:41.270 --> 1:17:43.053
Oh my God. Oh my God, Seth.

1:17:44.380 --> 1:17:45.213
Okay.

1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:48.433
Mark?

1:17:49.430 --> 1:17:51.084
Where are we?

1:17:51.084 --> 1:17:52.360
(dramatic music)

1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:53.410
- How did I get here?

1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:56.170
- It doesn't matter, it doesn't
matter, it doesn't matter.

1:17:56.170 --> 1:17:57.003
Just...

1:17:57.920 --> 1:17:59.070
Mark's getting a phone.

1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:01.490
Oh my God. Can you hurry?

1:18:01.490 --> 1:18:02.693
Can we get someone?

1:18:04.380 --> 1:18:06.036
What are you doing?

1:18:06.036 --> 1:18:09.590
(dramatic music)
(door creaking)

1:18:09.590 --> 1:18:10.423
Mark?
