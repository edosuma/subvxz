00:21.320 --> 00:23.760
- What's up?
- Receiving GDO transmission.

00:24.360 --> 00:27.800
- It's the Tok'ra, sir.
- Open the iris.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.720
- Maybe it's Dad.
- Maybe.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.360
Martouf. How are you?

00:46.120 --> 00:48.440
Samantha. Colonel O'Neill.

00:49.640 --> 00:53.400
- Well enough, under the circumstances.
- What's wrong?

00:54.360 --> 00:57.280
Maybe we should discuss this elsewhere.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.480
It's my father.

01:01.640 --> 01:04.360
- I'm afraid he's been captured by Sokar.
- Oh, my God.

01:04.519 --> 01:08.080
- As far as we know, he is still alive.
- As far as you know?

01:08.240 --> 01:12.760
You know that Sokar has assumed the
persona of the entity known as the Devil?

01:12.920 --> 01:15.520
Yeah. A bit pretentious, don't you think?

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
You must understand when I say
that if Selmak is still alive,...

01:20.160 --> 01:23.680
- ..he has been sent to Hell.
- As in...?

01:23.840 --> 01:28.720
A place of eternal suffering and
damnation from which there is no return.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.000
So, what are we really talking about here?

02:41.160 --> 02:44.240
Netu is a moon that orbits
Sokar's home planet.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.520
- A very hot moon, I take it.
- It is a place where fires burn strong.

02:48.680 --> 02:51.840
But you know for sure
that my father is still alive?

02:52.600 --> 02:55.960
I am sorry, Samantha.
I know this must be difficult.

02:56.120 --> 03:00.080
Once captured, Selmak and Jacob - your
father - would have been brutally tortured.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.560
But Sokar would rather see
his victims suffer than die.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.640
So we're talking about
a rescue mission here?

03:06.760 --> 03:11.320
Unfortunately, to our knowledge,
no one has ever escaped from Netu.

03:11.480 --> 03:12.840
Oh.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.680
No one except for Jolinar.

03:19.040 --> 03:21.720
- Oh.
- (Daniel) Ofcourse. It makes sense.

03:21.880 --> 03:25.400
A Goa'uld impersonating the Devil
would create a place like Netu.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.480
Netu is from the book of Am-Taut,...

03:27.640 --> 03:31.560
..a how-to guide on passing through the
ancient Egyptian "other world" regions.

03:31.720 --> 03:36.880
Those regions are dark places with pits of
fire, home to monsters and the damned.

03:37.040 --> 03:41.920
What little we know is based on legends
that have been perpetuated by Sokar.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.280
- How did Jolinar get out?
- She never said.

03:46.440 --> 03:50.680
No one ever asked her how she escaped
from an inescapable prison?

03:50.840 --> 03:53.680
She was found unconscious
and badly injured in a teltac -

03:53.840 --> 03:58.560
a cargo ship - floating adrift in space.
Her recovery was long and painful.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.040
She was encouraged to remember,
but she refused to speak of it.

04:02.200 --> 04:07.160
- Anyone curious as to why?
- I implored her, but she would not say.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.800
I only carried Jolinar for a short time.

04:09.960 --> 04:14.000
I've never had anything more than flashes
of her memories, occasionally dreams.

04:14.160 --> 04:17.399
But certainly never anything
like this place you're describing.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.959
The Tok'ra have technology
that aids the recall of memories, but...

04:21.120 --> 04:22.880
..you must be willing to use it.

04:23.040 --> 04:27.200
Well, if we're going in on this one, sir,
we're going to need a couple more units.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.880
A full military incursion
will be impossible, Colonel O'Neill.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.960
We do covert.

04:33.760 --> 04:37.000
Selmak's recovery
is obviously a high priority.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.400
However, and forgive me, Samantha,...

04:39.560 --> 04:42.360
..but there is something larger
at stake here.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.560
The Tok'ra believe that Sokar
is about to launch an attack...

04:45.720 --> 04:49.200
- ..against the System Lords.
- Isn't that good news?

04:49.360 --> 04:52.480
The disorganisation of
the System Lords' fragmented rule...

04:52.640 --> 04:55.520
..is a far more vulnerable target
than one powerful Goa'uld.

04:55.680 --> 04:59.560
- Especially if that Goa'uld is Sokar.
- He's that much worse than the others?

04:59.720 --> 05:02.640
Of all the gods he picked to impersonate,
he chose the Devil.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.320
We need to find Selmak and determine
what he knows about Sokar's attack.

05:07.480 --> 05:11.920
Without wanting to sound too dramatic,
the fate of the galaxy may be at stake.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.240
Sounds a bit overly dramatic.

05:15.560 --> 05:18.000
Sounds like we can't refuse.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.520
- Colonel, you have a go.
- Yeah.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.600
- When?
- As soon as you're ready.

05:22.760 --> 05:27.200
If you all are sure you understand
what you are volunteering for.

05:28.160 --> 05:32.360
- You said Hell, right?
- I'm gonna end up there sooner or later.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.440
Might as well check out
the neighbourhood, huh?

05:51.400 --> 05:55.760
The teltac we will require for the journey
awaits us on the planet Vorash.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.000
- Ship?
- There is no Stargate on Netu.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.880
Those banished there are taken by ship.

06:02.040 --> 06:05.680
Have I mentioned to you
that I hate surprises?

06:05.840 --> 06:09.880
We have a long journey ahead. There'll be
much time to inform you of all the details.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.160
Now, see, that puts me in a position
to be surprised.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.640
Chevron seven is locked.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.200
Major, you will bring
your father back safely.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.120
Yes, sir. We will.

06:43.600 --> 06:47.560
- (Carter) This ship looks familiar.
- It's the teltac in which Jolinar was found.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.520
(Martouf) It was severely damaged
when we found it.

06:50.680 --> 06:54.600
The flight mechanisms have been
repaired, but the hyperdrive engines...

06:54.760 --> 06:58.200
..can only be run at 40 per cent
without too much risk.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.520
Is this vessel equipped
with stealth capabilities?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.120
The ship we were in
could make itself invisible.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.680
- Really?
- It was an upgrade.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.200
You're obviously dealing
with a base model here.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.480
- Are you sure you can fly this ship?
- With great proficiency.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.440
While we're on the surface,
you may have to avoid Sokar's forces.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.680
- What, isn't Teal'c coming with us?
- He cannot.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.400
The atmosphere is impenetrable by ship.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.560
The only way to reach the surface
is in the descent pods.

07:37.720 --> 07:41.320
It is how all the damned are sent to Netu
by Sokar, and how we must arrive...

07:41.480 --> 07:43.840
..if we're to convince others
we can be trusted.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.080
- And there are only four pods?
- Correct.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.000
This counts as a surprise, you know.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.200
Shall we embark?

07:54.360 --> 07:56.440
By all means.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.880
To Hell with us.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.880
So what else can you tell us about Netu?

08:25.040 --> 08:28.160
The moon was once an industrialised
colony of the planet Delmak.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.920
When Sokar conquered Delmak,
he made it his home world.

08:31.080 --> 08:33.679
He transformed the environment
to suit the myths.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.919
He went to an awful lot of trouble.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.760
He filled the atmosphere with toxins,...

08:38.919 --> 08:43.600
..then blasted holes in the moon's
surface, releasing the molten core.

08:44.120 --> 08:47.640
As I apply the memory device,
you will feel a sharp pain.

08:47.800 --> 08:51.160
We've actually all experienced
this technology before.

08:51.320 --> 08:54.040
Good. Then you will know what to expect.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.480
(electronic beep)

08:59.240 --> 09:03.960
So we're actually gonna see Jolinar's
memories appear as holographic images?

09:04.120 --> 09:06.680
There are no specific ways
of targeting memories.

09:06.840 --> 09:09.920
Some of Samantha's own
personal memories may come out.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.920
Out of respect for her privacy, we will not
be using this part of the technology.

09:14.080 --> 09:17.040
- Thank you.
- You can describe what you see.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.520
I'm ready.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.400
- Sam?
- In here.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.600
Why are you crying?

09:41.440 --> 09:43.360
Where's Mom?

09:46.840 --> 09:48.760
Oh, God.

09:51.480 --> 09:54.200
Listen to me, Samantha.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.800
- I'm sorry. I'm stuck in my own past.
- Think of Jolinar.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.440
The last night we spent together
before she was captured by Sokar,...

10:01.600 --> 10:06.600
..we walked along the ridge of Noctana.
There were two moons out that night.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.280
I see it.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.120
You didn't speak of Jolinar leaving.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.600
You both knew it was dangerous
but she had to go.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.840
You stayed up all night together.

11:24.440 --> 11:27.000
- (whispers) Martouf...
- Are you OK?

11:27.120 --> 11:31.680
- I wanna try it again.
- I should have said this earlier.

11:32.080 --> 11:37.200
I know my personal relationship with
Jolinar is a source of discomfort for you.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.240
- Martouf...
- I want you to know,...

11:39.400 --> 11:43.520
..it has always been my belief that Jolinar
kept her experience on Netu a secret...

11:43.680 --> 11:46.760
..because she believed
it might come between us.

11:46.920 --> 11:50.800
I don't want you to hold anything back
for the same reason.

11:51.400 --> 11:55.160
- You don't have to protect me.
- OK.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.280
(electronic beep)

12:10.240 --> 12:12.160
- Aargh!
- Aargh!

12:13.520 --> 12:15.760
(evil laugh)

12:15.920 --> 12:18.000
- Aargh!
- (evil laugh)

12:19.200 --> 12:21.120
Aargh! Aargh!

12:21.280 --> 12:23.760
- Shut it off! Shut it off!
- Do it!

12:25.560 --> 12:27.480
(gasps)

12:33.560 --> 12:35.480
I saw someone.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.880
A dark figure. I think it was Sokar.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.720
- The pain was...
- I am sorry.

12:43.880 --> 12:48.200
The memory technology can provide
very realistic sensory recall.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.120
She was tortured... so badly.

12:58.360 --> 13:02.080
I'm going to turn it on again,
but at a lower setting.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.440
(electronic beep)

13:15.760 --> 13:17.920
She was on a ship like this one.

13:18.520 --> 13:20.680
They put her in a descent pod.

13:22.400 --> 13:26.240
There was a fire... all around.
It was hard to breathe.

13:42.760 --> 13:46.520
It's gone... I lost it.

13:46.680 --> 13:49.400
- We will arrive soon.
- I know, Martouf.

13:50.800 --> 13:54.080
I'm sorry. Maybe I'm not
gonna be able to do this.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.160
You have to.

13:57.360 --> 14:00.320
Hey, Marty. A word?

14:13.000 --> 14:16.720
- Pushin' a little hard, don't you think?
- There is not much time left.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.640
It's her father. She knows the stakes.

14:20.280 --> 14:23.840
If she does not remember Jolinar's
escape, I will not ask any of you...

14:24.000 --> 14:27.880
- ..to accompany me down to the surface.
- Why?

14:28.040 --> 14:31.720
- Anyone who goes will likely not return.
- But you're gonna go?

14:31.880 --> 14:35.520
I will attempt to locate Selmak
and communicate any information to you.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.680
You will return and relay it to the Tok'ra.

14:37.840 --> 14:41.840
And leave you and Jacob
down there to... what? Rot?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.040
With no means of escape...

14:44.200 --> 14:48.040
All right. First of all...
Carter's not gonna let you go without her.

14:48.200 --> 14:52.040
Secondly, I won't let it happen.
Thirdly, Jolinar escaped...

14:52.200 --> 14:55.240
- But if Samantha cannot recall...
- I know. I heard you.

14:55.400 --> 15:00.240
And forgive the bravado. But it's
been done before - it can be done again.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.520
(sighs)

15:09.280 --> 15:11.880
You gonna be OK?

15:12.040 --> 15:13.960
Yeah.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.480
It's just so confusing, you know.

15:17.600 --> 15:22.200
Images and faces.
Fragments of thoughts and feelings...

15:25.920 --> 15:29.440
There was a Goa'uld on Netu. Not Sokar.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.000
He was, um...

15:33.240 --> 15:36.320
Let's just say he was less than attractive.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.040
I know his name. I... I can't find it.

15:40.760 --> 15:45.640
But I get this... horrible, sick feeling
when I remember him.

15:45.800 --> 15:49.280
Something happened
between him and Jolinar.

15:49.720 --> 15:52.640
Something worse than
the torture and pain.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
Something Jolinar never wanted
Martouf to find out about.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.000
We have arrived at the coordinates.

16:26.600 --> 16:31.080
You must keep the disc concealed
from any denizens we may encounter.

16:31.520 --> 16:36.200
I will leave it on a minimal setting so you
may work through memories as we go.

16:36.360 --> 16:39.360
- Is that OK?
- Yeah, of course.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.920
- Carter?
- Thank you.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.320
Sokar would not send someone
down to Netu with weapons.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.920
Yeah. So?

16:48.080 --> 16:51.360
If they're found, the denizens
will know we were not sent by Sokar.

16:51.520 --> 16:56.200
We must attempt to blend, so that we will
be allowed to move freely as denizens.

16:56.360 --> 17:00.680
OK. We'll attempt to blend.
But we're not going down there unarmed.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.839
So, how do we communicate with Teal'c?

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
We believe this device
will penetrate the atmosphere.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.480
- "We believe"?
- We should be able to speak to him...

17:13.640 --> 17:16.680
..as long as the ship
remains in orbit of the moon.

17:32.840 --> 17:35.840
That's, uh... that's still a long way down.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.920
The pods are launched at a great velocity.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.520
That's supposed to make me feel better?

17:42.680 --> 17:48.160
Heat-dampening shields and anti-gravity
wave generators will slow our descent.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.520
So... smooth sailin' all the way, right?

17:53.280 --> 17:55.160
Not exactly, O'Neill.

18:13.640 --> 18:17.360
- Are you prepared?
- Uh, no. Not really.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.480
(bleeping)

18:40.360 --> 18:43.440
- O'Neill, can you hear me?
- Read you, Teal'c.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.200
You are now entering the atmosphere.

18:51.360 --> 18:53.280
(radio buzzes)

18:55.080 --> 18:57.000
Colonel O'Neill?

18:57.160 --> 18:59.080
(radio buzzes)

19:01.160 --> 19:03.080
(radio buzzes)

19:04.240 --> 19:06.160
O'Neill, can you hear me?

19:36.960 --> 19:38.880
(O'Neill) Carter?

19:39.640 --> 19:42.560
- Daniel?
- Over here!

19:50.360 --> 19:53.280
- (Carter) This way!
- (O'Neill) Let's move!

20:10.600 --> 20:12.600
(Daniel) My lungs are burning.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.600
(O'Neill) Well, at least it's a dry heat.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.800
(Teal'c) Colonel O'Neill, respond.

20:31.720 --> 20:35.560
Yeah, Teal'c. We're in one piece.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.760
Just hang tight and we'll be in touch.

20:38.920 --> 20:42.080
- We should follow this tunnel.
- You remember.

20:42.400 --> 20:47.400
Being here helps. It should lead to the
underground remains of the old colony.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.600
It's one of the only inhabitable places left.

21:09.440 --> 21:13.440
(Daniel) ls it me, or is it actually
getting hotter in here?

21:13.600 --> 21:18.200
- (O'Neill) A little of both, probably.
- (Carter) There's something up ahead.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.160
This way.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.720
(wailing)

21:33.000 --> 21:34.920
(screaming)

21:36.840 --> 21:40.240
Well... it's certainly not Emerald City.

21:50.360 --> 21:52.280
(screaming)

22:01.240 --> 22:03.160
(O'Neill) Howdy, folks.

22:04.320 --> 22:10.400
We're... new in these parts.
I know that's hard to tell, but it's true.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.280
(whispering)

22:18.800 --> 22:20.720
Carter?

22:35.240 --> 22:37.160
Bynarr.

22:42.040 --> 22:45.360
- What does that mean?
- It's the name I couldn't remember.

22:45.520 --> 22:49.000
- We've come to see Bynarr.
- (distorted) Who are you?

22:53.520 --> 22:56.120
People of little consequence.
Pay no attention to us.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.840
- Kneel before me.
- Who's this guy?

23:00.480 --> 23:04.840
He is Na'onak.
First prime to Bynarr, Lord of Netu.

23:05.360 --> 23:08.480
- We've come to see Bynarr.
- (distorted) You will not!

23:08.640 --> 23:13.680
- Banish them to the surface.
- I... don't... think so.

23:14.080 --> 23:17.720
Back off. Back off a little there, folks.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.080
(coughs)

23:32.240 --> 23:35.760
(distorted) Who asks for me by name?

23:35.920 --> 23:37.840
I do!

23:39.320 --> 23:43.000
I'm Samantha Carter,
host of Jolinar of Malk-shur.

23:47.920 --> 23:52.040
Take their weapons!
Throw them in the pit!

24:01.480 --> 24:04.200
(O'Neill) Of course. The pit.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.600
Thank you!

24:16.760 --> 24:18.680
(distant cries)

24:20.280 --> 24:24.200
Mmm. The smells keep getting
better and better, don't they?

24:29.200 --> 24:31.520
This doesn't look encouraging.

24:42.280 --> 24:46.200
I thought weapons weren't allowed. We've
seen a staff weapon and a hand device.

24:46.360 --> 24:49.800
- I do not understand it myself.
- Surprise, surprise.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.200
Bynarr is Sokar's appointed leader.

24:53.360 --> 24:57.160
He's permitted a hand device
and one staff weapon for his first prime.

24:57.320 --> 25:01.240
What made you think Bynarr
would be sympathetic to Jolinar?

25:01.400 --> 25:04.720
I was sure he was the one
that helped her escape.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.800
Why?

25:07.840 --> 25:09.760
She, um...

25:19.080 --> 25:21.000
I'm sorry.

25:21.800 --> 25:25.120
He's the key. Bynarr may not
have knowingly helped Jolinar,...

25:25.280 --> 25:28.440
..but I'm sure he must know
how she escaped.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.680
Sam...

25:31.400 --> 25:33.600
Sam...

25:33.760 --> 25:35.680
Dad?

25:36.880 --> 25:38.800
Dad!

25:39.920 --> 25:41.840
Dad!

25:43.000 --> 25:46.800
- Am I dreaming?
- No. No, we're real.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.200
Are you crazy?

25:50.920 --> 25:52.840
Uh, apparently.

25:54.160 --> 25:57.200
- Are you OK?
- I've been better.

26:00.440 --> 26:03.840
- Selmak?
- He's dying.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.520
This will help.

26:17.600 --> 26:20.520
Hang in there.
We're gonna get you outta here.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.920
Marty...

26:30.520 --> 26:32.440
Thank you.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.720
Is he gonna make it?

26:38.560 --> 26:42.680
Not here. Unless we get him
out of this place soon, he will die.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.600
It's OK. I'm here.

27:17.480 --> 27:21.160
I am humbled by your presence,
my lord Sokar.

27:22.200 --> 27:25.040
(distorted) Bynarr, Lord of Netu,...

27:25.680 --> 27:29.760
..l do not have time to hear of
the sufferings of the damned on this day.

27:29.920 --> 27:33.160
Allow me to offer thanks
for returning the Tok'ra Jolinar,...

27:33.320 --> 27:37.520
..the one who betrayed me,
so that I may seek my revenge.

27:37.680 --> 27:41.960
- Of what do you speak?
- She arrived today with three others.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.640
I did not send her to you.

27:53.480 --> 27:59.120
They are intruders. Find out
what they want... then kill them.

28:00.240 --> 28:05.440
I had hoped to take my revenge
on Jolinar slowly, my lord.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.200
To see her suffer
in the harshest ways of the damned.

28:08.360 --> 28:12.600
Go now! Report back to me in one day.

28:13.320 --> 28:17.240
- Heed my command.
- Without fail, my lord.

28:22.320 --> 28:25.320
A ship brought these intruders.

28:25.760 --> 28:30.680
- Find it and destroy it.
- Yes, my lord.

28:48.280 --> 28:51.160
Do you have the strength to speak?

28:51.720 --> 28:55.000
We can relay communication
to the Tok'ra council.

28:56.320 --> 28:59.920
Sokar's fleet is ten times larger
than we thought.

29:01.280 --> 29:05.880
He is poised to attack six
key System Lords. He will win.

29:06.040 --> 29:10.320
He will control an army big enough
to rule the galaxy if that is so.

29:10.480 --> 29:14.800
- When is all this supposed to happen?
- It was to take place two weeks...

29:14.960 --> 29:18.560
..from the time I was captured.
That was... four days ago.

29:18.720 --> 29:22.480
- We must relay this to the Tok'ra now.
- Yeah.

29:23.240 --> 29:25.240
Teal'c, come in.

29:29.880 --> 29:31.600
O'Neill, it is l.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.480
(O'Neill) We found Jacob.
He's in pretty rough shape.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.400
Have you yet determined
a means of escape?

29:37.560 --> 29:42.480
Uh, no, not yet.
Martouf wants to talk to you, though.

29:48.680 --> 29:51.920
I have a message you must relay
to the Tok'ra high council...

29:52.080 --> 29:54.400
..if we do not get out of here.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.960
(distorted) Samantha Carter.

30:06.440 --> 30:09.280
- You will come with me.
- Who's calling?

30:09.440 --> 30:11.880
- Now!
- Come and get her yourself, you...

30:12.040 --> 30:14.200
Sir!

30:14.360 --> 30:18.120
- This may be our only way out of here.
- How do you figure?

30:18.400 --> 30:21.120
If I can just get close
to Bynarr, talk to him...

30:21.280 --> 30:23.200
Move!

30:27.520 --> 30:30.520
Yeah, OK. Go ahead.

30:31.760 --> 30:34.520
Look after my dad.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.520
(door shuts)

31:03.440 --> 31:05.360
(wailing)

31:21.600 --> 31:23.800
(knocks)

31:23.960 --> 31:25.880
(distorted) Enter.

31:59.560 --> 32:01.480
Take it.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.960
You have no symbiote within you.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.760
No.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.960
How, then, do you know of Jolinar?

32:24.120 --> 32:27.040
- I once carried her.
- I should have known.

32:27.440 --> 32:33.120
Jolinar would have died on the surface
before she showed her face to me again.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.240
Because she betrayed you.

32:37.360 --> 32:42.000
Look what Sokar took from me
because of her.

32:45.320 --> 32:48.440
- Where is she now?
- She's dead.

32:49.320 --> 32:51.640
You know how she escaped.

32:52.280 --> 32:54.400
I don't. I don't remember.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.560
Why have you come here?

33:01.720 --> 33:04.200
(woman cries)

33:07.480 --> 33:09.400
Sam?

33:10.520 --> 33:12.840
- She'll be back.
- Where is she?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.960
- She's with Bynarr.
- No...

33:16.120 --> 33:19.080
Samantha believes Bynarr
is the key to our escape.

33:19.240 --> 33:23.960
- He's Sokar's eyes and ears here.
- Well, eye and ears.

33:24.560 --> 33:28.240
- He ensures there are no uprisings.
- Keeps the conditions liveable.

33:28.400 --> 33:32.720
And he reports to Sokar regularly.
Sokar enjoys hearing about the suffering.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.160
- What's that?
- Sokar comes here?

33:35.320 --> 33:38.280
No. Bynarr goes to the planet.

33:40.520 --> 33:43.760
- How do you know?
- I saw him there before I was captured.

33:43.920 --> 33:46.240
Do you know how he gets there?

33:55.280 --> 33:57.600
Our most recent addition...

33:58.560 --> 34:00.880
..is the Tok'ra Selmak.

34:07.840 --> 34:10.400
Have you come to rescue him?

34:13.080 --> 34:15.000
(evil laugh)

34:17.040 --> 34:20.639
Did you think I helped Jolinar to escape?

34:21.159 --> 34:24.000
- Yes.
- Why?

34:25.600 --> 34:27.920
Because you loved her.

34:34.040 --> 34:36.480
You are mistaken.

34:37.320 --> 34:39.639
Then why do you hate her so much?

34:41.199 --> 34:44.639
Her death has robbed me of the revenge...

34:44.800 --> 34:47.400
..that I have long dreamed of.

35:12.080 --> 35:15.680
I won't get the same satisfaction
from killing you.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.960
But I will get some.

35:22.760 --> 35:24.680
No! Wait!

35:48.400 --> 35:50.320
- You all right?
- Yeah. Dad?

35:50.480 --> 35:52.400
He's hanging in there.

35:54.080 --> 35:56.840
There are transportation rings
in Bynarr's quarters.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.920
They must lead to Sokar's palace.

35:59.080 --> 36:02.120
Jolinar managed to steal
a cargo ship and escape.

36:02.280 --> 36:05.520
(distant voice) The Lord of Netu is dead!

36:06.640 --> 36:09.560
- What's goin' on up there?
- Na'onak just killed Bynarr.

36:09.720 --> 36:11.760
- What? Why?
- I have no idea.

36:11.920 --> 36:15.200
Bynarr was about to kill me.
Na'onak shot him with his staff weapon.

36:15.360 --> 36:19.040
- He just sent me back down here.
- The denizens will riot.

36:21.160 --> 36:23.320
- This could be our shot.
- To do what?

36:23.480 --> 36:26.120
- The rings go to Sokar's palace.
- It's a way outta here.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.520
She was one person,
and she had a hand device.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.760
- Leave me.
- Uh, Jacob...

36:30.920 --> 36:33.920
You seem to be missing the whole point.

36:34.080 --> 36:36.240
Teal'c.

36:36.400 --> 36:39.040
- Is that possible?
- (both) What?

36:40.000 --> 36:43.320
- The cargo ship has rings.
- The ring transportation devices...

36:43.480 --> 36:47.480
..work like Stargates over shorter
distances. They transmit a matter stream.

36:47.640 --> 36:52.320
- If it is intercepted by another receiver...
- Whoa, whoa! Simplify, please.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.760
If Teal'c can manoeuvre into position,...

36:54.920 --> 36:58.360
- ..theoretically we can transport aboard.
- "Theoretically"?

36:58.520 --> 37:02.120
- How does he find the position?
- The mechanism can locate other rings.

37:02.280 --> 37:05.120
Teal'c should be able
to detect the coordinates.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.600
I'll take those odds.

37:07.760 --> 37:09.720
Come here.

37:23.280 --> 37:26.960
Teal'c, it's Daniel. Come in.
Teal'c, do you copy?

37:27.120 --> 37:29.040
I hear you, Daniel Jackson.

37:30.240 --> 37:33.920
- Teal'c, it's Daniel. Come in. Over.
- What are you doing?

37:34.520 --> 37:39.400
I'm just communicating with my friend
from this little communication device.

37:58.480 --> 38:01.920
Teal'c, this is Daniel.
We need you. Do you copy?

38:03.640 --> 38:06.000
- (shooting)
- I copy.

38:12.080 --> 38:13.280
(Carter) This way!

38:13.440 --> 38:17.280
The ring device on the ship should locate
the path the matter stream will take.

38:17.440 --> 38:19.760
(Teal'c) I will be in position.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.280
Oh, hell.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.840
It's gone. The key that
activates the rings is gone.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
- Where was the key to be inserted?
- Over here.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.880
Can you make it work?

39:03.480 --> 39:07.560
- It will take time.
- Take all you need.

39:25.520 --> 39:28.680
Teal'c, we're almost ready.
Teal'c, do you copy?

39:35.080 --> 39:37.120
- We gotta go.
- Almost.

39:43.920 --> 39:45.840
Get ready!

39:47.320 --> 39:49.240
Teal'c!

39:52.280 --> 39:54.520
- He's not responding.
- He said he'd be there.

39:54.680 --> 39:56.600
- If he is not...
- He'll be there.

40:01.720 --> 40:03.640
(distorted) Move away!

40:09.680 --> 40:11.000
OK.

40:29.080 --> 40:31.400
Kneel before Na'onak!

40:36.560 --> 40:39.680
You shall call me Na'onak no longer.

40:39.840 --> 40:41.760
From this day forth,...

40:41.920 --> 40:44.480
..l will reclaim my real name:

40:53.840 --> 40:55.800
Apophis.
