00:14.800 --> 00:18.000
What the hell have you done?
What are you doing?

00:18.080 --> 00:20.680
-Have you been protecting the robber?
-Yes.

00:22.520 --> 00:25.320
Have you been threatened,
or what's this about?

00:27.080 --> 00:29.480
You did it voluntarily?

00:30.680 --> 00:31.760
Yes.

00:31.840 --> 00:34.400
So tell me who the hell it is.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.120
She's actually just a normal

00:38.800 --> 00:39.720
mom.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.000
My name is Jim Johansson. I'm a policeman.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.520
I'm sorry.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.400
I don't understand how I could do this.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.240
Are you the robber?

01:09.400 --> 01:13.960
Liv, you need to
explain everything properly.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.400
I can't lose my girls.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.560
I can't lose my girls.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.840
What's happened to your girls?

01:28.600 --> 01:31.920
Hi, Mommy's darlings.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.320
I just wanted to say Happy New Year.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.120
-How are you?
-Good.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.480
Are you celebrating New Year with us?

01:41.760 --> 01:43.280
No, I'm not.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.040
Not this year.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.840
Can you have dinner and sleep over here?

01:48.840 --> 01:50.120
No, I can't.

01:50.680 --> 01:51.640
Please.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.320
When can we come to your place?

01:55.600 --> 01:56.880
Soon, darling.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.280
This is for you.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.240
Oh, that's nice.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.880
How about you go to your room?

02:01.960 --> 02:04.640
-Mommy loves you.
-Say bye to Mommy.

02:05.240 --> 02:06.240
It'll be fine.

02:07.480 --> 02:08.920
-Okay.
-Bye.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.600
So, have you found an apartment?

02:15.320 --> 02:16.760
I'll have it soon.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.720
I'm afraid I'll have to give you this.
It's a court order.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.920
If you don't get a contract
before January,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.960
you'll lose custody.

02:33.480 --> 02:38.440
-That's how serious this is.
-I'm about to get a rental contract.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.800
Stråkvägen 1.
I'll get the apartment in the new year.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.520
That's great,
but I need to see the contract.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.760
I need to pay some rent in advance.

02:47.840 --> 02:52.880
Right, you do that, and then we'll see.

02:54.680 --> 02:58.800
Can I borrow 6,500 from you?
I'll pay it back later.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.120
You can't keep doing that.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.640
Please.

03:02.720 --> 03:07.600
We're divorced now and you need to
take responsibility for your life.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.840
You're the one who ruined it.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.240
You fucked my boss so that I lost my job.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.000
You wanted the divorce
and threw me out of our home.

03:17.640 --> 03:22.000
What the hell? I don't get it.
What happened to our life?

03:22.080 --> 03:24.800
Calm down and think of the kids.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.480
That's all I ever do.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.600
They need their mom too.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.720
You just focus on this one thing.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.720
Get that damn rental agreement.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.880
You need to have it,
otherwise they'll stay here from January.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.920
I don't have anyone else I can ask.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.920
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to go.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.040
Okay. Happy New Year.

04:16.520 --> 04:20.120
GIVE ME 6500!

04:23.920 --> 04:25.760
We need to help her.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.960
But I need some time
to work out how to do it,

04:30.040 --> 04:32.120
so we have one more thing to ask.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.640
We'd like some fireworks.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.200
Fireworks?

04:39.240 --> 04:41.480
What's her name, dammit?

04:42.120 --> 04:42.960
Liv.

04:43.760 --> 04:44.720
Liv Holmberg.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.760
She's a lovely woman.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.480
A good mom, a nice person.

04:52.720 --> 04:55.560
Is that her?

04:55.640 --> 04:56.680
Is she the robber?

04:58.440 --> 04:59.280
Yes.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.840
Of course it was wrong
and stupid to try and rob a bank,

05:03.920 --> 05:07.120
but she was so desperate.

05:07.200 --> 05:10.360
She felt that her life was over.
When that's the case, it's easy

05:11.080 --> 05:12.440
to make stupid decisions.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.920
If anyone's made stupid decisions here,
it's you, right?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.120
You've been protecting a criminal, Dad.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.120
I wanted to give her a chance.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.080
You've been helping her, dammit.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.480
She's a criminal. Fucking hell.

05:24.560 --> 05:29.400
You've been such a role model for me
all my fucking life, and now…

05:31.160 --> 05:33.200
I understand that you're disappointed.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.520
Where did she go?

05:35.640 --> 05:38.120
-I don't know.
-Come on.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.560
It's true. I don't know.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.680
She fucking robbed a bank!

05:41.760 --> 05:45.040
She's taken hostages
and fired shots and shit.

05:45.120 --> 05:48.280
She was under
phenomenal amounts of pressure.

05:48.360 --> 05:52.320
-You don't understand this situation.
-Do you know what I feel like doing?

05:52.400 --> 05:55.000
I feel like reporting you
for professional misconduct.

05:55.520 --> 05:59.520
You're a lousy policeman
and a useless dad.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.040
Hi.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.360
I'm looking for Liv Holmberg. Is she here?

06:32.880 --> 06:35.000
No, she doesn't live here anymore.

06:36.440 --> 06:38.920
-This is her registered address.
-She's moved out.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.600
We're getting divorced.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.920
-Why would you like to talk to her?
-I can't say, I'm afraid.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.440
What… Hi there.

06:46.520 --> 06:50.280
Lasse, you need to be honest
when a policeman asks you questions.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.800
What do you mean? He just got here.

06:53.880 --> 06:54.720
Yes.

06:56.800 --> 06:57.640
What?

06:59.040 --> 06:59.960
Yes…

07:01.280 --> 07:04.640
Liv lives in a storeroom,
and she can't have her daughters there.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.400
-In a storeroom?
-Yes, it's insane. We've said that.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.440
-Where is the storeroom?
-Stråkvägen 1.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.800
Stråkvägen 1.

07:13.880 --> 07:17.320
She's been promised a rental contract
at the same property.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.480
-It's kind of--
-But we haven't seen that yet.

07:19.560 --> 07:22.760
She's very unstable
and not a very good mom.

07:22.840 --> 07:27.920
I used to work with her. I was her boss.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.160
I've told the other official agencies that

07:31.240 --> 07:35.240
the best thing is
if Lasse gets custody of both girls.

07:35.320 --> 07:39.280
If, after a while, it turns out
she can fulfill her role as a mom,

07:39.360 --> 07:42.280
she can arrange proper accommodation.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.080
But you do need proper accommodation

07:45.160 --> 07:49.280
and not some
chicken wire cage with a padlock.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.160
-Well, it's made of wood.
-But the kids--

07:52.240 --> 07:57.600
-But it's not great.
-I see. Thanks for your time.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.320
I asked for rent in advance, as usual.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.280
That's how it works.

08:05.360 --> 08:09.520
But she never came in with the money,
so I had to find another tenant.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.320
I see.

08:11.400 --> 08:15.520
Do you think I should have given her
a contract without any security?

08:16.280 --> 08:19.160
No, I don't know how these things work.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.720
So let me tell you how things work.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.960
There's a hell of a lot of whining
coming from all these tenants

08:25.040 --> 08:27.480
thinking that I'm some kind of charity,

08:27.560 --> 08:30.200
simply because I own multiple properties.

08:30.280 --> 08:34.160
I'm more than happy to donate money
to Lions, or whatever,

08:34.240 --> 08:35.520
but on my terms.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.960
And this Liv was whining endlessly

08:39.040 --> 08:41.720
about her husband who'd fucked her boss,

08:41.800 --> 08:46.640
and he's threatened to take the children
from her unless I offer her a contract.

08:46.720 --> 08:49.080
Suddenly it's all on me.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.360
I see.

08:50.440 --> 08:53.520
So I'm supposed to give her 6,500 kronor

08:53.600 --> 08:55.800
to avoid her life going up shit creek.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.480
Six thousand five hundred?

08:57.560 --> 08:59.080
Yes, the advance rent.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.520
Is that the exact amount?

09:00.600 --> 09:02.040
Yes, and that's cheap.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.440
Where is she now?

09:03.520 --> 09:05.800
-No idea.
-Would you show me the storeroom?

09:05.880 --> 09:06.880
Sure.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.720
Stefan speaking.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.960
In the glove compartment.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.600
-Where is it?
-Down on the right.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.640
What do you mean, it's not there?

09:25.480 --> 09:30.040
I put the keys and the contract
in an envelope in the…

09:30.640 --> 09:33.760
It's supposed to be
in the glove compartment.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.160
It's there. Check again.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.240
They must be under something.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.280
Check again.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.840
Just get down to the car and check again.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.000
It's all there.

09:53.320 --> 09:56.040
Have you finished looking? I need to go.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.000
Yes.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.280
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.120
-Hi.
-The police are looking for me.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.280
Calm down. Come in.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.680
-They don't know you're living here.
-I don't know how it would work.

10:28.760 --> 10:31.560
If I move in with the kids,
they'll find me.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.600
-They know who I am.
-We don't know for sure that they know.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.520
We do. They came looking for me
in the storeroom.

10:37.600 --> 10:42.120
One thing at a time. Let's have
a glass of wine and just calm down.

11:01.280 --> 11:05.120
They're coming out. Six of them, right?
Or is someone behind them?

11:10.360 --> 11:11.920
My dear.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.680
Won't you come and look at the fireworks?

11:17.240 --> 11:19.160
They're terrific.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.520
They're for your girls.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.960
You're so nice, Estelle.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.160
My girls.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.440
They love fireworks.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.920
Oh, sweetheart.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.760
I understand you more than you think.

11:42.840 --> 11:45.040
Nothing is more important than your kids.

11:45.880 --> 11:49.200
I know how you can get away.

11:50.200 --> 11:55.200
Just do as I say
and everything will be alright.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.720
Next year will be a good year.

11:59.360 --> 12:00.320
Believe me.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.520
-Do you think so?
-I promise you.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.640
Are you going somewhere?

12:57.720 --> 12:59.440
I'm resigning.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.920
I thought it was time to move on.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.720
Right, so what do you want?

13:06.360 --> 13:08.120
I want to know where the robber is.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.880
Do you think I know?

13:10.960 --> 13:12.680
Yes, I do.

13:13.240 --> 13:16.400
I know that you hostages
have lied when questioned

13:16.480 --> 13:20.160
and that you have protected the robber,
Liv Holmberg.

13:20.240 --> 13:23.120
I want to know where she is, Zarah.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.840
I have no idea where she is.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.280
Why would I believe you now?

13:30.760 --> 13:33.120
Because I have stopped lying.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.840
I'm being totally honest.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.240
I'm not lying. I don't know where she is.

13:44.560 --> 13:46.600
Could you drop this off at the bank?

13:47.480 --> 13:49.480
If you promise not to jump.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.400
Okay.

13:55.560 --> 13:56.640
No!

14:00.480 --> 14:02.800
-No, that's…
-What…

14:06.400 --> 14:11.000
Why have you got that letter?
Why have you got it?

14:11.080 --> 14:12.320
It's my letter.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.360
I handed it in.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.880
-At this bank.
-What?

14:22.440 --> 14:23.960
Yes, he…

14:28.000 --> 14:31.760
The guy on the bridge,
he gave it to me before he…

14:32.880 --> 14:36.160
So I was a kid. I was 13.

14:36.240 --> 14:39.000
I was on my way back from school when…

14:41.200 --> 14:45.080
I thought I'd be able to stop him,
but he just jumped.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.240
I couldn't stop him.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.080
It was…

14:51.120 --> 14:52.640
You did all you could.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.360
At least you tried.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.320
Did you know him?

15:00.000 --> 15:03.920
No, I didn't know him,
but he was a client.

15:05.920 --> 15:09.400
He wanted a loan.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.280
But I denied him a loan commitment.

15:18.320 --> 15:21.120
That was just before he went off and…

15:22.480 --> 15:23.560
before he…

15:25.360 --> 15:28.440
That's why I went
to the viewing of that apartment.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.120
Just to have a look.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.600
To see where he grew up.

15:35.720 --> 15:38.480
Is he Estelle's son?

15:38.560 --> 15:39.600
Yes.

15:41.920 --> 15:45.080
I didn't know. I had no idea.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.200
Yeah.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.360
What's in the letter?

15:53.600 --> 15:55.160
I haven't opened it.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.360
I've been too scared.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.880
-What I don't like is that--
-Hi.

16:28.480 --> 16:31.120
Hello, Constable. How is it going?

16:31.200 --> 16:35.360
-Have you found the robber yet?
-It's going well, actually.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.840
We're progressing.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.480
Estelle,

16:41.640 --> 16:42.760
I have to ask you

16:43.280 --> 16:47.080
something about your son.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.120
Gustav? He's not alive anymore.

16:51.720 --> 16:55.560
I know.
I didn't know that he was your son.

16:56.640 --> 17:00.760
I was there and met him when he…
or just before he…

17:03.400 --> 17:05.800
just before it happened. Before he jumped.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.960
You were there?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.680
I really tried to save him.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.600
I did…

17:15.480 --> 17:18.760
I tried, but it didn't work.

17:21.920 --> 17:26.080
He couldn't be saved.
He was suffering from incurable cancer.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.200
Hang on. Did he have cancer?

17:31.280 --> 17:33.800
Yes, that's why he committed suicide.

17:33.880 --> 17:39.280
He didn't want to die slowly
with his body plagued with tumors

17:39.360 --> 17:40.800
and full of painkillers.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.960
I thought I--

17:46.040 --> 17:49.040
I'm sure you did what you could.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.680
That's what you do as a human being.

17:53.440 --> 17:58.640
If you get a chance
to save someone, you take it.

17:59.920 --> 18:03.080
I think that makes you
a better person too.

18:05.160 --> 18:10.040
Sometimes things aren't what they seem.
Appearances can be deceiving.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.160
It was wrong of me to lie to you,

19:24.240 --> 19:26.000
to keep the truth from you.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.680
You're a good policeman, Jack,

19:28.760 --> 19:30.880
and you have 40 years of service left.

19:31.680 --> 19:33.920
I understand that you have to do your job.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.040
I just wanted to say that I've found out

19:43.320 --> 19:44.480
where she lives.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.080
With Estelle.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.800
Do what you have to do.

20:21.960 --> 20:26.400
You can play outside for half an hour,
then it's lunchtime.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.200
-Can we have tacos?
-No, pancakes.

20:30.280 --> 20:33.440
We're having something really yummy.
Where's your coat?

20:33.520 --> 20:36.480
-I think it's in my room.
-I'll get it.

20:37.360 --> 20:40.680
-Can we play hide and seek?
-I want to hide first.

20:40.760 --> 20:43.880
-No, I do.
-No, I do.

20:45.440 --> 20:49.120
-Are you a policeman?
-Yes, I am. Who are you?

20:49.200 --> 20:52.640
My name is Vera,
although Mommy calls me monkey.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.680
-I'm the frog and Mommy is the moose.
-I see.

20:56.280 --> 20:57.160
Where is--

21:16.800 --> 21:19.440
Why are you here?

21:27.600 --> 21:29.080
Do you know what?

21:30.400 --> 21:33.200
So, you know your mommy
does everything for you.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.800
-Yes.
-Not everyone has a mom like that.

21:35.880 --> 21:36.720
No.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.120
That's how it is.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.480
We're going outside now.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.800
-Bye.
-Bye, Mr. Policeman.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.040
Am I not coming with you?

21:57.760 --> 21:58.600
No.

21:59.160 --> 22:03.240
You need to stay here with your kids.
They need you.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.080
Thank you.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.680
I realize that you've had a tough time.

22:10.760 --> 22:15.360
I did something totally insane.
I'm really not that kind of person.

22:15.440 --> 22:18.080
I understand, but that's what happened.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.400
So, just a question.

22:20.480 --> 22:24.480
How the hell did you get out
of the apartment that night?

22:29.560 --> 22:31.760
Right. Let's do this.

22:32.520 --> 22:35.840
No, I can't. I just can't.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.560
-I can't do this.
-Yes, that's what we agreed.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.320
I know, but I'm so--

22:40.400 --> 22:41.880
We're hostages.

22:41.960 --> 22:45.520
We've experienced
something highly unpleasant.

22:45.600 --> 22:49.520
Therefore, no one will be surprised
if we behave a bit strangely.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.840
I'm just asking you to go along with it.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.760
Go along with it and all will be fine.

22:55.720 --> 22:56.560
Yes.

22:56.640 --> 23:01.560
-Where is she going?
-The less you know the better.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.560
Okay? Let's go.

23:04.640 --> 23:05.640
Yes.

23:24.560 --> 23:26.760
FOR ESTELLE FROM KLAS-GÖRAN

23:36.840 --> 23:39.080
Jim, I can see movement in the apartment.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.480
<i>The hostage taker</i>
<i>may still be in the apartment.</i>

23:41.560 --> 23:42.600
Roger.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.160
Police!

24:06.920 --> 24:10.040
Hang on. In an apartment in this block?

24:10.120 --> 24:11.440
Just outside?

24:11.520 --> 24:13.120
Yes, next door.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.280
-Yeah.
-Oh shit.

24:24.280 --> 24:27.440
I really hope I won't see you again.

24:28.640 --> 24:33.000
For real. I don't wanna see you again.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.200
And look after yourself.

24:37.840 --> 24:38.840
And the kids.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.120
I went to arrest her,

24:59.200 --> 25:03.600
but when I saw her
and the kids and everything,

25:03.680 --> 25:05.480
I just couldn't do it.

25:06.080 --> 25:06.920
I just couldn't.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.120
"To err is human,

25:11.640 --> 25:13.320
to forgive divine."

25:18.600 --> 25:19.960
I am very proud of you.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.800
You're a much better policeman than I am.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.200
Maybe sometimes.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.400
A lot of the time.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.080
But you're a great dad, anyway.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.440
It was…

25:38.160 --> 25:40.280
Sorry for what I said. I shouldn't have.

25:40.360 --> 25:43.160
It's fine.

25:45.800 --> 25:49.440
"But I'm choosing to end my life."

25:50.320 --> 25:53.600
"You should know that
it's not your fault. Gustav."

25:57.240 --> 25:59.040
How incredibly generous.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.640
He didn't have to write to you.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.280
He had a few other things on his mind.

26:05.360 --> 26:06.520
Indeed.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.800
What are you gonna do
now you're no longer a banker?

26:10.840 --> 26:11.760
I don't know.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.000
I've got an idea.

26:14.520 --> 26:15.560
Of course you do.

26:15.640 --> 26:20.680
Plumber. Definitely.
You have a typical plumber's aura.

26:20.760 --> 26:21.600
Okay.

26:22.120 --> 26:23.600
Thanks for the advice.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.760
It's a nice bridge.

26:33.840 --> 26:34.680
No.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.400
What?

26:37.120 --> 26:39.320
You can't say it's a nice bridge.

26:39.840 --> 26:43.240
-I think it's nice.
-No, Venice has pretty bridges.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.800
This is a bog standard brutalist bridge.

26:45.880 --> 26:46.760
Just like you.

26:46.840 --> 26:50.520
You're bog standard boring,
but great to me.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.520
Okay, then.

26:57.280 --> 26:58.120
Jill?

26:58.640 --> 27:01.000
<i>-Hi, Dad.</i>
-Hi, how are you?

27:02.400 --> 27:05.120
I'm fine. Just a bit tired.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.480
<i>That's understandable.</i>

27:10.000 --> 27:10.920
Hey, I…

27:12.040 --> 27:15.080
I meant what I said before.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.240
I want you to move home.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.040
What does Jack think?

27:21.680 --> 27:22.880
He wants that too.

27:25.520 --> 27:26.640
Thanks, Dad.

27:28.920 --> 27:30.000
I'm sorry.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.880
<i>I've really made up my mind now, Dad.</i>

27:37.520 --> 27:40.000
<i>I will quit. I promise.</i>

27:40.840 --> 27:42.680
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

27:44.440 --> 27:46.200
<i>That's great, Jill.</i>

27:46.760 --> 27:48.800
<i>We'll do this together.</i>

27:51.040 --> 27:52.240
<i>I love you.</i>

27:52.320 --> 27:53.840
I love you too.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.080
<i>-Kisses.</i>
-Kisses.

28:13.200 --> 28:17.480
Look. I think you should go for
the dark gray color on the skirting.

28:17.560 --> 28:20.960
These light walls
can also be painted gray.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.120
Anna-Lena wanted to put up wallpaper.

28:23.200 --> 28:26.000
Wallpaper? Is she mad? Darling!

28:26.080 --> 28:28.640
-Yes.
-Do you think we should wallpaper here?

28:28.720 --> 28:29.960
Wouldn't that be good?

28:30.040 --> 28:31.480
-Hello.
-Hi.

28:31.560 --> 28:34.760
-How was yesterday?
-A bit better.

28:34.840 --> 28:38.200
-That's so expensive.
-They'll be living here a long time.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.080
How often are you in the hallway?

28:41.840 --> 28:43.680
-Are you okay?
-Oh, sure.

28:44.920 --> 28:49.680
The girls want to teach me something
called "shut up" on the cell phone.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.400
But it's too tricky for me.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.960
Shut up?

28:53.040 --> 28:54.280
That's not very nice.

28:54.360 --> 28:57.920
-It's called Snapchat.
-Snapchat.

28:58.440 --> 29:01.080
I'll get this, and you go see the kids.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.560
Okay, thank you.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.360
Hey, guys.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.520
Are you pranking Granny?

29:06.600 --> 29:10.960
Is there a little monkey here?
Are you coming to get me?

29:11.040 --> 29:12.320
No!

29:24.720 --> 29:25.960
-Hello.
-Hi.

29:34.920 --> 29:35.960
How are you?

29:36.840 --> 29:37.960
I'm okay.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.400
-It's good to see you.
-It's nice to see you too.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.440
I do feel okay.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.080
Do you?

30:17.280 --> 30:18.320
Hi, Dad.
