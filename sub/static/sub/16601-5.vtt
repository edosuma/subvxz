00:03.210 --> 00:05.434
No tenant should be bullied!

00:05.534 --> 00:07.836
No tenant should be bullied!

00:07.837 --> 00:10.437
Fair housing is a right for all!

00:10.439 --> 00:12.539
Fair housing is a right for all!

00:12.541 --> 00:14.608
No tenants should be bullied!

00:14.610 --> 00:16.943
No tenants should be bullied!

00:16.945 --> 00:19.618
Fair housing is a right for all!

00:19.619 --> 00:20.985
Fair housing is a right for all!

00:20.987 --> 00:23.888
Officer! They don't have
a permit for this!

00:23.890 --> 00:25.723
Don't you people
have someplace to be?!

00:25.725 --> 00:27.057
Get the hell off my property!

00:27.059 --> 00:28.459
What are you people doing here?!

00:28.461 --> 00:30.594
As soon as you improve
the living conditions

00:30.596 --> 00:32.329
of your tenants.

00:32.331 --> 00:34.365
Stop cutting off
their electricity,

00:34.367 --> 00:36.200
restore basic services!

00:36.202 --> 00:37.868
Oh, what the hell
do you know?!

00:37.870 --> 00:41.105
I know that as long as
you keep harassing your tenants,

00:41.107 --> 00:43.473
we will not back down!

00:43.475 --> 00:45.274
We will not back down!

00:45.276 --> 00:48.311
Let me put this into language
you can understand.

00:48.313 --> 00:49.880
<i>Vete, puta!</i>

00:51.750 --> 00:53.383
<i>No retrecedemos!</i>

00:53.385 --> 00:54.384
<i>Puta!</i>

00:55.521 --> 00:57.387
Don't back down!

00:57.389 --> 00:59.889
Don't back down!
Don't back down!

00:59.891 --> 01:01.157
Don't back down!

01:01.159 --> 01:03.926
Don't back down!
Don't back down!

01:03.928 --> 01:05.728
Hey, you!

01:07.765 --> 01:09.499
Don't back down!

01:09.501 --> 01:12.301
Don't back down!
Don't back down!

01:12.303 --> 01:13.836
Don't back down!

01:16.574 --> 01:18.941
Coryna Garza again?
Erin...

01:18.943 --> 01:21.376
Winding people up
to destroy private property

01:21.378 --> 01:23.746
is not community activism,
it's a crime.

01:23.748 --> 01:24.980
Erin, wait.

01:24.982 --> 01:26.949
And, sure, I can get behind
civil disobedience,

01:26.951 --> 01:28.817
under the right
circumstances,

01:28.819 --> 01:31.620
but when it crosses the line
into flat-out vandalism,

01:31.622 --> 01:33.488
it's a no-go.
Erin, listen!

01:33.490 --> 01:34.489
What?

01:34.491 --> 01:35.757
You're not gonna
have to prosecute

01:35.759 --> 01:36.925
Coryna Garza this time.

01:36.927 --> 01:39.994
Good. Why not?

01:39.996 --> 01:41.496
Because the Department
of Homeland Security

01:41.498 --> 01:42.730
wants to deport her.

01:42.732 --> 01:44.299
What are you talking about?

01:44.301 --> 01:46.334
The say they have reason
to believe Coryna Garza's

01:46.336 --> 01:47.669
in the country illegally.

01:47.671 --> 01:50.838
I've prosecuted her five times
in the past two years.

01:50.840 --> 01:53.575
I think I would've known
if she wasn't a legal citizen.

01:53.577 --> 01:55.009
Have you seen
her birth certificate?

01:55.011 --> 01:57.211
I must've, at some point.

01:57.213 --> 01:58.546
Would it be
in your files?

01:58.548 --> 02:01.950
If I felt like spending
the day looking, it probably is.

02:01.952 --> 02:03.651
Let's just go down
to the source.

02:03.653 --> 02:04.919
Where are they holding her?

02:04.921 --> 02:07.288
They're not. They
released her R.O.R.

02:07.290 --> 02:09.656
After the arraignment, she fled
to St. Mary of the Woods

02:09.657 --> 02:11.258
before Homeland
could detain her.

02:11.260 --> 02:13.360
Well, why don't they just
go in and take her?

02:13.362 --> 02:14.895
I think it's called “optics.”

02:14.897 --> 02:16.230
There's a crowd out front,

02:16.232 --> 02:18.832
it looks like the original
Rainbow Coalition.

02:28.310 --> 02:30.043
Eddie, when I said
I'd take a walk with you,

02:30.045 --> 02:31.177
I didn't say a jog.

02:31.179 --> 02:32.819
Oh, pick up the pace,
Reagan. I'm gonna...

02:35.618 --> 02:37.517
You know him?
Did he have a earring?

02:37.519 --> 02:39.519
In his right or left ear?
I didn't notice.

02:39.521 --> 02:41.654
Adriana, my-my psychic--
she told me that my soul mate

02:41.656 --> 02:44.557
has long hair, a beard
and a piercing in his left ear.

02:44.559 --> 02:46.226
Oh, your soul mate's a pirate?

02:47.162 --> 02:48.628
Wait, you have a psychic?

02:48.630 --> 02:49.862
Oh, come on, Jamie.

02:49.864 --> 02:51.998
Haven't you ever walked
past one of those places

02:52.000 --> 02:54.567
and wondered if they could
really see into your soul?

02:54.569 --> 02:55.868
Not once.

02:55.870 --> 02:59.071
Well, Adriana, within
two seconds of meeting me,

02:59.073 --> 03:01.007
she knew my dad
was in prison,

03:01.009 --> 03:03.142
and I hadn't even said
anything about him.

03:03.144 --> 03:04.844
Whoa.

03:07.181 --> 03:09.348
Come in, come in
for two seconds.

03:09.350 --> 03:11.983
You'll meet her, you'll
totally understand.

03:17.291 --> 03:18.757
We're closed.

03:18.759 --> 03:21.426
Oh, no, I have
an appointment with Adriana.

03:21.428 --> 03:23.262
She's not here. Now go away.

03:23.264 --> 03:25.397
Is everything okay, sir?

03:25.399 --> 03:27.132
What can you do about it?

03:27.134 --> 03:29.067
Depends.
My name's Officer Janko.

03:29.069 --> 03:30.334
This is my partner

03:30.336 --> 03:32.436
Officer Reagan.

03:32.438 --> 03:34.405
Forgive my rudeness.

03:34.407 --> 03:35.840
My name is Nick Polk.

03:35.842 --> 03:38.576
Adriana's my girl.
She didn't come home last night.

03:38.578 --> 03:39.678
Is that unusual?

03:39.680 --> 03:40.679
You don't think it's unusual

03:40.681 --> 03:42.313
for a 16-year-old
not to come home?

03:42.315 --> 03:45.015
You're taking dating
advice from a teenager?

03:45.017 --> 03:48.152
She's a Romani gypsy.
Her gift comes at birth.

03:49.155 --> 03:51.556
Do you have any idea
where she might be, Mr. Polk?

03:51.558 --> 03:53.891
Her <i>gaje</i> boyfriend, Eric,
lives a couple blocks away.

03:53.893 --> 03:55.359
She may be there.

03:55.361 --> 03:58.629
Well, why don't you
text me the address.

03:58.631 --> 03:59.897
We'll take a look.

03:59.899 --> 04:01.699
Eddie...
It's not a big deal.

04:01.701 --> 04:03.934
She'll probably figure out
we're coming anyway.

04:03.936 --> 04:06.636
'Cause she'll intuit
that we're coming.

04:13.713 --> 04:15.312
At the end of the day,

04:15.314 --> 04:18.147
it's the combination of
targeted community outreach

04:18.149 --> 04:20.550
and consistent
and reasonable

04:20.552 --> 04:24.087
broken windows policing
that is the rising tide

04:24.089 --> 04:27.090
that lifts up all boats
in the 36.

04:28.493 --> 04:30.560
Captain, I usually
recommend to a C.O.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.795
about to attend
his first CompStat meeting

04:32.797 --> 04:34.931
that he pack
an extra pair of briefs,

04:34.933 --> 04:36.799
but you're gonna do just fine.

04:37.836 --> 04:39.668
Shall we?

04:41.039 --> 04:43.505
How much time we got?
I'll tell your detail to bring up the car.

04:43.507 --> 04:45.074
About 15 minutes.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.142
Could I have a minute
with you, sir?

04:46.144 --> 04:47.509
A minute?
What's up?

04:47.511 --> 04:49.078
Earlier this morning,
we received word

04:49.080 --> 04:51.079
that the U.S. Marshals Service
was planning

04:51.081 --> 04:55.083
a significant gang raid on
the 400 block of East Danvers.

04:57.488 --> 04:59.655
You got a mole
in the Marshals Service?

04:59.657 --> 05:01.890
No, I got a C.I. it turns out
works for them, too.

05:01.892 --> 05:03.024
Real entrepreneur.

05:03.026 --> 05:04.893
Gold?
Solid.

05:04.895 --> 05:06.061
He puts it at about

05:06.063 --> 05:07.763
a dozen targeted members
of the 4Fly crew.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.438
And you're
bringing this up because?

05:09.439 --> 05:11.972
Because my guess is that
they're gonna come to us

05:11.974 --> 05:14.174
last-minute for support
and mop-up.

05:14.176 --> 05:15.543
Support we'd normally provide.

05:15.545 --> 05:17.344
But if we assist them
in rolling through there

05:17.346 --> 05:18.379
like some conquering army...

05:18.381 --> 05:19.647
Wait, am I
missing something?

05:19.649 --> 05:21.015
Getting a crew off the street

05:21.017 --> 05:22.850
is a positive step
for everybody.

05:22.852 --> 05:24.851
An operation like this
needs to be fully vetted.

05:24.853 --> 05:26.320
The 400 is a mixed block.

05:26.322 --> 05:27.955
And you don't trust
the Marshals office

05:27.957 --> 05:29.456
has done the due diligence?

05:29.458 --> 05:30.657
It's a bit more complicated.

05:30.659 --> 05:33.493
The 4Fly looks out
for a lot of people up there.

05:33.495 --> 05:36.230
They give money, food,
toys during Christmas.

05:36.232 --> 05:39.499
This isn't a gang of Robin Hoods
we're talking about.

why Homeland Security

06:21.600 --> 06:23.067
didn't want to barge in?

06:23.069 --> 06:24.435
Optics.

06:24.437 --> 06:26.603
Yeah, well, apparently
they're willing to wait her out,

06:26.605 --> 06:28.171
at least in the short term.

06:28.173 --> 06:30.741
Well, apparently they've
never met Coryna Garza.

06:30.743 --> 06:33.444
She plays a long game.

06:33.446 --> 06:34.611
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:34.613 --> 06:35.712
What?

06:35.714 --> 06:37.280
I don't think you
want to walk in there

06:37.282 --> 06:38.682
past the news cameras.

06:38.684 --> 06:40.751
Well, I didn't come down here
to stand outside.

06:40.753 --> 06:43.253
My buddy's
running point on this.

06:43.255 --> 06:44.620
Give me a minute.

06:44.622 --> 06:46.923
I'll get you in
through the back.

06:46.925 --> 06:50.427
<i>Viva Garza! Viva Garza!</i>

06:53.432 --> 06:55.098
They don't have a
right to evict you.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.666
You have every right,
as tenants...

06:56.668 --> 06:58.734
Ms. Garza.
Can we lose the posse?

07:01.440 --> 07:04.373
Erin Reagan.

07:04.375 --> 07:07.009
When was the last time
we did business?

07:07.011 --> 07:08.377
The clean water
thing in Queens?

07:08.379 --> 07:09.645
No, that was two times ago.

07:09.647 --> 07:11.614
The last time was a protest
in Jackson Heights.

07:11.616 --> 07:14.516
The 30 days in
prison you got me.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.652
That's another brick
in my house in heaven.

07:16.654 --> 07:18.220
That is how I look at it.

07:18.222 --> 07:20.722
This time, I'll get you
a new kitchen for that house.

07:20.724 --> 07:23.358
You incited the destruction
of private property

07:23.360 --> 07:25.260
and took a swing at the owner,

07:25.262 --> 07:26.395
Ronald Tourneff.

07:26.397 --> 07:28.029
You must be so disappointed
Homeland Security

07:28.031 --> 07:29.698
is ruining your persecution.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.500
It's a prosecution.
Not from were I sit.

07:31.502 --> 07:34.436
And yes, they can get in line,
which why I want to get you

07:34.438 --> 07:36.337
out of this church
and back into the courtroom.

07:36.339 --> 07:38.707
But first, where is
your birth certificate?

07:38.709 --> 07:40.809
Like I said,
persecution.

07:40.811 --> 07:42.577
No, the law of the land.

07:42.579 --> 07:44.813
DHS seems to think
you're illegal.

07:44.815 --> 07:46.247
Whatever.
It's not my problem.

07:46.249 --> 07:47.548
It will be if you're deported.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.951
Oh, they're deporting
citizens now?

07:49.953 --> 07:51.785
Not if you can
prove you are one.

07:51.787 --> 07:54.255
I left it in my other purse--
you know, the one I was carrying

07:54.257 --> 07:56.557
before I had to seek refuge
in a church.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.627
DHS is not gonna wait forever.

08:00.463 --> 08:03.297
Fine, knock yourself out.

08:03.299 --> 08:05.099
Go see my mom in Brooklyn.

08:05.101 --> 08:07.668
She will be proud
to show it to you.

08:07.670 --> 08:09.603
But be warned:

08:09.605 --> 08:12.006
Lucinda's gonna
talk your ear off.

08:23.853 --> 08:26.219
Adriana's boyfriend,
Eric Woodman,

08:26.221 --> 08:27.987
he's got a record--
aggravated assault.

08:27.989 --> 08:30.190
Been out on probation
three months.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.293
There she is.

08:33.294 --> 08:35.695
Told you she was
intuitive. Adriana.

08:35.697 --> 08:37.797
Eddie.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.299
What are you doing here?

08:39.301 --> 08:40.767
Hey, your dad's
worried about you.

08:41.836 --> 08:43.434
What the hell's going on?
Eric, go back inside.

08:43.437 --> 08:45.071
I can handle this.

08:45.073 --> 08:47.106
She's with me
and we haven't done anything.

08:47.108 --> 08:48.908
I told you. Come on.
Eric, are you aware

08:48.910 --> 08:50.276
that cohabitating
with a minor

08:50.278 --> 08:51.711
violates the terms
of your parole?

08:51.713 --> 08:53.579
Come on, man.

08:53.581 --> 08:55.548
You're 21. She's not.
You want me to run down a list

08:55.550 --> 08:57.249
of the crimes
you could be charged with?

08:59.820 --> 09:01.320
Sorry, babe.

09:01.322 --> 09:02.688
What?

09:02.690 --> 09:04.156
We're history.

09:04.158 --> 09:06.358
What?

09:12.366 --> 09:14.132
Oh...

09:14.134 --> 09:17.069
man, I'm gonna miss this.

09:18.572 --> 09:20.538
Eric?

09:20.540 --> 09:22.874
It's almost worth
going back to jail for.

09:22.876 --> 09:25.177
Almost.

09:29.183 --> 09:31.015
Can we give you
a ride home?

09:31.017 --> 09:32.116
I can walk.

09:32.118 --> 09:33.784
Shouldn't you
be in school?

09:33.786 --> 09:35.453
All Romani
are home-schooled.

09:35.455 --> 09:37.855
Well, shouldn't you
be at home in school?

09:37.857 --> 09:39.123
What's the difference?

09:39.125 --> 09:41.759
It's not like I'm gonna
grow up to be a doctor.

09:43.062 --> 09:45.062
Hey, shouldn't we go after her?

09:45.064 --> 09:46.231
And do what?

09:46.233 --> 09:47.798
I don't know.
Arrest her?

09:47.800 --> 09:49.433
For what?
Truancy.

09:49.435 --> 09:51.435
It's over, Eddie.
We did what we could.

09:51.437 --> 09:53.337
Let's take the win
and move on, okay?

10:03.415 --> 10:08.885
I don't know where I have
put her birth certificate.

10:08.887 --> 10:12.723
If you just give me a little
time, I'm sure I'll find it.

10:12.725 --> 10:15.058
We actually don't have time.

10:15.060 --> 10:16.926
Mrs. Garza, we need it now.

10:16.928 --> 10:18.962
I hope it didn't
get lost.

10:18.964 --> 10:21.898
My mother lost mine, like,
ten times when I was a kid.

10:22.868 --> 10:24.100
Don't ask.

10:24.102 --> 10:26.669
What hospital was
Coryna born at?

10:26.671 --> 10:29.072
We can call
the Department of Health

10:29.074 --> 10:30.339
and ask for a reprint.

10:30.341 --> 10:31.374
I don't remember.

10:31.376 --> 10:32.642
I'm sorry.

10:32.644 --> 10:35.044
Mrs. Garza, I understand
if you're skeptical of me,

10:35.046 --> 10:38.547
but Coryna could be in a lot
of trouble if you can't find it.

10:38.549 --> 10:40.516
But I can understand

10:40.518 --> 10:43.986
if you can't find it.

10:43.988 --> 10:46.922
Because it doesn't exist,
does it?

10:49.727 --> 10:52.895
At least not a real one.

10:56.934 --> 10:59.301
Coryna was born in Colombia.

10:59.303 --> 11:01.870
And you're not her real mother,
are you?

11:02.706 --> 11:05.073
No.

11:05.075 --> 11:08.376
She's my cousin's
daughter.

11:08.378 --> 11:13.014
She brought her to the
States when she was a baby,

11:13.016 --> 11:15.283
but she was deported

11:15.285 --> 11:18.787
when Coryna was,
uh, one year-old.

11:18.789 --> 11:20.322
And you pretended
to be her mother

11:20.324 --> 11:22.223
so she could stay
in the country.

11:23.927 --> 11:25.627
All we wanted for her

11:25.629 --> 11:28.595
was a chance for a better life.

11:28.597 --> 11:31.966
Are you telling me
Coryna doesn't know?

11:31.968 --> 11:33.567
No. We thought
it was best not...

11:33.569 --> 11:34.902
<i>Abuela,</i> I'm hungry.

11:34.904 --> 11:37.471
Is that the way
you ask?

11:37.473 --> 11:40.208
This is Coryna's
daughter Nadia.

11:40.210 --> 11:42.409
Nadia, say hello
to Ms. Reagan.

11:42.411 --> 11:43.977
Hello.

11:45.748 --> 11:48.148
And Mr....
What's your name?

11:48.150 --> 11:49.516
Anthony's fine.

11:49.518 --> 11:51.017
Uh, Mr. Anthony.

11:51.019 --> 11:53.253
Why don't I go to the kitchen
with you? I'm hungry, too.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.389
You look like
you're always hungry.

11:55.391 --> 11:57.023
Aye, Nadia!

11:57.025 --> 11:58.325
Kid speaks her mind.

11:58.327 --> 11:59.759
Just like her mother.

12:04.967 --> 12:08.869
The law is absolutely clear
when it comes to citizenship.

12:08.871 --> 12:10.904
Her first words were in English.

12:10.906 --> 12:12.272
She's American.

12:12.274 --> 12:16.642
Not without an actual U.S.
birth certificate, she's not.

12:16.644 --> 12:20.480
But if you send her away,
what I go do?

12:20.482 --> 12:22.114
What Nadia would do?

12:22.116 --> 12:23.750
I'm sorry, but this is
out of my hands.

12:23.752 --> 12:25.852
It isn't.
It is.

12:25.854 --> 12:27.854
You work for the justice system.

12:27.856 --> 12:29.756
<i>Criminal</i> justice, to be exact.

12:29.758 --> 12:30.990
So the crime

12:30.992 --> 12:34.393
Coryna did
carries out a sentence

12:34.395 --> 12:35.627
of losing her daughter?

12:35.629 --> 12:37.062
That's your justice?

12:37.064 --> 12:38.530
I... I didn't say that.

12:38.532 --> 12:40.732
Isn't that the outcome?

12:46.473 --> 12:49.941
And why didn't the U.S. Marshals
Service notify me sooner?

12:49.943 --> 12:51.242
Couldn't take the risk
of a leak.

12:51.244 --> 12:53.244
I'll try not to get offended
at that,

12:53.246 --> 12:54.846
but it's gonna be hard.

12:54.848 --> 12:56.448
Erring on the side of caution.

12:56.450 --> 12:58.016
Erring? You got that part right.

12:58.018 --> 12:59.618
Look, the second
we show presence,

12:59.620 --> 13:01.887
if we don't hit all targets
simultaneously,

13:01.889 --> 13:03.922
we lose a percentage
to the wind.

13:03.924 --> 13:05.523
Can't take that chance.

13:06.626 --> 13:08.592
Our TAC plan.

13:10.196 --> 13:12.030
There is not enough time
to prepare

13:12.032 --> 13:14.265
for an operation of this size.

13:17.170 --> 13:19.170
We're prepped.

13:19.172 --> 13:21.505
As is the U.S. Attorney
for the Southern District.

13:21.507 --> 13:23.040
He meant us, the NYPD.

13:23.042 --> 13:25.643
I've highlighted the areas
where I see you assisting.

13:25.645 --> 13:27.344
Basic stuff, no big deal.

13:27.346 --> 13:30.180
Any time I put my officers
in harm's way,

13:30.182 --> 13:32.215
it's a big deal to me.

13:32.217 --> 13:34.885
Of course, but...

13:34.887 --> 13:36.954
Based on this TAC plan, you want
us locking down streets,

13:36.956 --> 13:38.121
covering the rears
of buildings,

13:38.123 --> 13:40.557
loading your prisoners
into vans.

13:40.559 --> 13:43.493
That's where we see you
being most useful.

13:43.495 --> 13:45.095
As mop-up?

13:47.599 --> 13:49.333
If that's the way
you want to look at it.

13:49.335 --> 13:50.767
You got another way
to look at it?

13:50.769 --> 13:55.738
And if I decide the NYPD
will sit this one out?

13:55.740 --> 13:58.207
We'll proceed without you.

13:59.978 --> 14:02.679
All due respect, Commissioner,
I don't need your approval

14:02.681 --> 14:04.313
to carry out this raid.

14:04.315 --> 14:07.484
I always know when someone says
“all due respect”

14:07.486 --> 14:09.519
that the last thing
I'm gonna get from them

14:09.521 --> 14:12.054
is the respect that's due.

14:13.992 --> 14:15.424
Thank you for your time.

14:31.486 --> 14:34.687
So, I've lived my
entire life as a lie...

14:34.689 --> 14:35.821
No.

14:35.823 --> 14:39.758
...that I couldn't have
known was a lie?

14:39.760 --> 14:43.195
I-I understand this must be
difficult to comprehend.

14:43.197 --> 14:45.431
Really? You mean that my
mom isn't really my mom?

14:45.433 --> 14:48.000
And my real mom dumped
me when I was one?

14:48.002 --> 14:49.935
Yeah, “difficult
to comprehend”.

14:49.937 --> 14:51.370
That's one
way to put it.

14:51.372 --> 14:54.506
I'm sorry, uh,
but the facts are...

14:54.508 --> 14:57.075
Nadia.

14:57.077 --> 14:58.243
She was born here.

14:58.245 --> 15:01.379
Which is a good thing
but it's not everything.

15:03.017 --> 15:04.683
You do me one solid?

15:06.319 --> 15:07.853
Wow.

15:07.855 --> 15:09.687
You bring me this news...

15:09.689 --> 15:11.389
Look, we are not pals,
remember?

15:11.391 --> 15:12.757
I'm your persecutor.

15:12.759 --> 15:15.726
Someone is trying
to destroy my family,

15:15.728 --> 15:17.695
and I got to find out
who the hell it is.

15:17.697 --> 15:20.365
And I need your help.

15:20.367 --> 15:24.102
Even if we find out who called
DHS, what will it matter?

15:24.104 --> 15:27.271
It doesn't change the fact
that you're not a citizen.

15:29.375 --> 15:31.075
You a smart lawyer, right?

15:31.077 --> 15:33.343
You don't think it's
a coincidence that one day

15:33.345 --> 15:35.479
I'm on the front lines
fighting for the little guy,

15:35.481 --> 15:38.749
and then the next day
they're trying to deport me?

15:39.986 --> 15:41.751
So ask yourself, why now?

15:41.753 --> 15:43.520
What's changed?

15:43.522 --> 15:44.754
And what's the answer?

15:44.756 --> 15:46.790
Tourneff? Who else
but that slumlord?

15:46.792 --> 15:49.993
Ronald Tourneff asked our office
to drop the charges against you.

15:49.995 --> 15:51.861
He didn't want the publicity.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.663
For him to sic DHS on you,

15:53.665 --> 15:56.366
it would only bring him more
unwanted publicity.

16:01.306 --> 16:02.839
Who else?

16:05.477 --> 16:06.977
You got an ex-husband?

16:06.979 --> 16:09.713
What does that have
to do with anything?

16:10.849 --> 16:12.281
Yes, I do.

16:12.283 --> 16:14.050
It end well?

16:15.686 --> 16:17.386
Not particularly.

16:17.388 --> 16:22.024
You ever wake up in the middle
of the night, and go...

16:22.026 --> 16:24.893
I wonder if he's....

16:24.895 --> 16:28.097
messing with me
somewhere, somehow?

16:28.099 --> 16:31.133
Just for kicks.

16:35.506 --> 16:37.873
What's his name?

16:46.250 --> 16:47.649
Eddie.

16:47.651 --> 16:48.983
What are you doing here?

16:48.985 --> 16:50.585
Just checking in.

16:50.587 --> 16:52.787
I'm, I'm fine.

16:52.789 --> 16:54.422
Um, you really
shouldn't be here.

16:54.424 --> 16:55.157
Why not?

16:55.159 --> 16:56.458
I have a client coming.

16:56.460 --> 16:59.294
Well, I'm a client.

16:59.296 --> 17:01.496
What do you say we do
a little makeup session?

17:01.498 --> 17:03.931
Besides, you did stand me up
the other day.

17:05.868 --> 17:07.468
Okay, fine.

17:12.608 --> 17:14.809
Are you still looking
for Mr. Right?

17:14.810 --> 17:16.477
Let's talk about
something else.

17:16.479 --> 17:18.012
I want you to find
a friend of mine.

17:18.013 --> 17:21.114
A young woman with
an amazing gift.

17:21.116 --> 17:23.250
I'm concerned she's in
some kind of trouble.

17:23.252 --> 17:24.917
Eddie...
Can you locate her for me?

17:24.920 --> 17:27.921
Because I may not be
good at reading minds,

17:27.923 --> 17:30.157
but I'm pretty good at knowing
when someone needs help.

17:30.159 --> 17:32.626
Adriana, are you down there?

17:32.628 --> 17:34.562
I'm sorry. I can't find
this friend for you.

17:34.564 --> 17:36.664
What is it, your father?
You have to go.

17:36.666 --> 17:38.098
Adriana, the door's locked.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.399
I'll be right there, Papa.

17:39.401 --> 17:41.702
You have to go now.
Mr. Hatcher.

17:41.704 --> 17:43.603
“Hatcher”?

17:43.605 --> 17:45.089
Do you understand?
Mr. Hatcher?

17:45.113 --> 17:46.140
What's Hatcher?

17:46.141 --> 17:48.474
You have to get out of here.

17:48.476 --> 17:49.910
But--
Go.

17:49.912 --> 17:52.478
Adriana. Adriana!

18:01.223 --> 18:03.690
Boss, I just want to say,
before we're headed off

18:03.692 --> 18:05.491
to the Marshal's office,
just for the record...

18:05.493 --> 18:07.460
You see anyone taking notes?

18:07.462 --> 18:09.629
I think he should be
coming to us.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.797
Why?

18:11.799 --> 18:12.965
Out of respect.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.767
I mean, he wants us
to do mop-up,

18:14.769 --> 18:17.036
at least he should ask for it
in our house.

18:17.038 --> 18:18.070
He already did.

18:18.072 --> 18:19.671
No, he didn't ask.
He told.

18:19.673 --> 18:21.006
Oh, you don't like his manner.

18:21.008 --> 18:23.042
Nah, he's like
a dachshund,

18:23.044 --> 18:24.643
who thinks he's a Rottweiler.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.078
And as for assistance,

18:26.080 --> 18:28.580
if it were me, I would give him
a couple of flashlights

18:28.582 --> 18:30.115
and a can of pepper spray.

18:30.117 --> 18:31.416
Well, it's not you, it's me.

18:31.418 --> 18:34.353
Well, sometimes I think
you're too accommodating.

18:34.355 --> 18:35.420
Nah.

18:35.422 --> 18:36.788
Sometimes, boss.

18:36.790 --> 18:39.924
Well, at least Vaughn
acts his job.

18:39.926 --> 18:40.726
What does that mean?

18:40.728 --> 18:42.527
He is what he does.

18:42.529 --> 18:44.896
He doesn't put lipstick
and perfume on it.

18:44.898 --> 18:48.867
He doesn't use all those
warm-glass-of-milk words.

18:48.869 --> 18:51.136
I thought old school
had become a bad thing.

18:51.138 --> 18:54.139
I think the pendulum has swung
too far sometimes.

18:54.141 --> 18:56.941
A guy like Vaughn says he wants
to try community outreach,

18:56.943 --> 18:58.342
it means he wants to reach out

18:58.344 --> 18:59.943
and grab the community
by the throat.

18:59.945 --> 19:01.812
Sir?

19:01.814 --> 19:03.714
What? Okay.

19:03.716 --> 19:04.915
And now that's a good thing?

19:04.917 --> 19:08.719
Well, not in everyone,
but in law enforcement,

19:08.721 --> 19:10.821
in a command position...

19:10.823 --> 19:12.690
it might rub people
the wrong way,

19:12.692 --> 19:15.025
but some people need to
be rubbed the wrong way.

19:20.332 --> 19:21.731
Got to be
in it to win it, right?

19:21.733 --> 19:22.933
That's right, pal.

19:22.935 --> 19:25.836
I'm one scratch away
from winner!

19:25.838 --> 19:28.338
Did you know that Coryna
was not a legal citizen?

19:28.340 --> 19:31.208
Hey... that face,
that body?

19:31.210 --> 19:33.009
I didn't exactly ask.

19:34.346 --> 19:36.746
Would you like me
to make a few phone calls

19:36.748 --> 19:38.848
on the outstanding warrants
you have?

19:38.850 --> 19:43.052
It should make for
a very busy afternoon.

19:43.054 --> 19:44.587
Yeah, I knew.

19:44.589 --> 19:47.156
One night Lucinda got
a few drinks in her,

19:47.158 --> 19:50.693
this was when I was considered
a catch by the two of them,

19:50.695 --> 19:54.096
and she confided Coryna wasn't
her kid, wasn't born here.

19:54.098 --> 19:56.165
Uh, she thought
I should be in on it,

19:56.167 --> 19:57.733
being I was family now
and all.

19:57.735 --> 19:59.969
So you saw an opportunity
for yourself,

19:59.971 --> 20:01.337
and you betrayed her confidence.

20:01.339 --> 20:02.671
I kept the secret.

20:02.673 --> 20:06.174
Until you could
profit from it.

20:06.176 --> 20:08.510
W-What are you
talking about?

20:08.512 --> 20:10.879
You called Homeland Security
on Coryna.

20:10.881 --> 20:13.081
No. It wasn't me.

20:13.083 --> 20:16.051
If you stand to gain in
any way from the information

20:16.053 --> 20:17.252
you provided to
Homeland Security,

20:17.254 --> 20:19.521
you can be prosecuted.

20:19.523 --> 20:21.223
You think I'm trying
to get money out of Coryna?

20:21.225 --> 20:22.257
No, not money.

20:22.259 --> 20:24.359
Something more valuable.

20:24.361 --> 20:26.761
Like what?

20:26.763 --> 20:29.331
Custody of your daughter.

20:31.401 --> 20:33.902
Lady, you got this all wrong.

20:33.904 --> 20:35.570
I don't want custody.

20:35.572 --> 20:37.939
Give me a break. What father
doesn't want custody?

20:37.941 --> 20:40.140
In this case,
the one who loves his kid.

20:40.142 --> 20:42.543
Now, you've spent
a couple of minutes with me.

20:42.545 --> 20:44.979
Would you want me
to have custody of your kid?

20:44.981 --> 20:46.447
Put it like that...

20:46.449 --> 20:48.115
Exactly, and I've spent

20:48.117 --> 20:49.116
a lot of years with me.

20:49.118 --> 20:51.986
Believe me,
I made the right choice.

21:05.792 --> 21:07.324
Say I buy a
car from you,

21:07.326 --> 21:09.727
and later that night I get
stopped for a broken taillight.

21:09.729 --> 21:11.729
I couldn't have known there
was a broken taillight.

21:11.731 --> 21:13.297
You should've done
a walk-around.

21:13.299 --> 21:14.398
A what?

21:14.400 --> 21:16.867
Eh, when I handed over
the title and the keys,

21:16.869 --> 21:19.270
you should've checked that
all the lights were working.

21:19.272 --> 21:21.405
Can you for once
be slightly less linear?

21:21.407 --> 21:22.539
I could try.

21:22.541 --> 21:24.675
Let's say we get the
aunt and the ex and--

21:24.677 --> 21:26.009
I don't know,

21:26.011 --> 21:28.078
there should be other people
involved in this--

21:28.080 --> 21:30.413
to swear that there's no way

21:30.415 --> 21:31.882
that Coryna knew
she was illegal.

21:31.884 --> 21:34.017
So there was no path
to becoming a citizen

21:34.019 --> 21:37.120
'cause she had no idea
that she wasn't one.

21:37.122 --> 21:39.055
She couldn't have done
a walk-around.

21:39.057 --> 21:41.091
She didn't know
she was looking for anything.

21:41.093 --> 21:42.058
Exactly.

21:42.060 --> 21:44.193
Hello?

21:44.195 --> 21:46.696
Yeah. I understand,

21:46.698 --> 21:49.899
but just hear me out
for a second...

21:49.901 --> 21:52.101
I understand, sir.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.436
Copy that.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.704
What?

21:54.706 --> 21:55.371
Egan.

21:55.373 --> 21:56.205
Bad?

21:56.207 --> 21:57.740
“No way, no how,” quote,

21:57.742 --> 22:01.243
“are you to pursue this Coryna
Garza situation any further.”

22:01.245 --> 22:02.111
Or?

22:02.113 --> 22:04.413
My resignation, his desk.

22:04.415 --> 22:05.781
What are you gonna do?

22:05.783 --> 22:07.249
Only thing I can do.

22:07.251 --> 22:08.818
Walk away.

22:08.820 --> 22:12.654
Free Coryna! Free Coryna!

22:12.656 --> 22:15.390
Free Coryna! Free...

22:18.228 --> 22:20.128
I really appreciate
you coming down here, Mr. Polk.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.096
This will only take a minute.
Of course, of course.

22:22.098 --> 22:24.232
After what you did for me,
Officer, I'm-I'm happy to help.

22:24.234 --> 22:26.301
Well, my partner and I got
in a little hot water

22:26.303 --> 22:28.236
with our sergeant.
He thought we were playing hooky

22:28.238 --> 22:30.171
when we were looking
for Adriana.

22:30.173 --> 22:31.172
Right this way.

22:31.174 --> 22:32.941
Well, let's go
straighten him out.

22:32.943 --> 22:35.243
Is this an interrogation room?

22:35.245 --> 22:37.445
Looks like one of those
I've seen on TV.

22:37.447 --> 22:38.512
Yeah, sorry about that.

22:38.514 --> 22:40.315
All the conference rooms
are being repainted.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.985
Long overdue, but
still. Take a seat.

22:43.987 --> 22:46.520
What can I do for you?

22:46.522 --> 22:47.889
We were hoping
you could write a statement.

22:47.891 --> 22:49.490
Sure. Saying what?

22:49.492 --> 22:51.992
That you conned Bill Hatcher
out of 50 grand.

22:51.994 --> 22:54.495
What the hell is this?

22:54.497 --> 22:57.197
We have pretty good evidence
that says that you used Adriana,

22:57.199 --> 23:00.000
a minor, as a shill
to line your pockets.

23:00.002 --> 23:02.069
Nobody forced him.
Is he saying otherwise?

23:02.071 --> 23:05.138
You conned him into believing
you could contact his dead wife.

23:05.140 --> 23:06.506
Me? No.

23:06.508 --> 23:08.775
Not me. I didn't do anything.

23:08.777 --> 23:09.943
It was Adriana.

23:09.945 --> 23:12.545
You expect me
to believe that Adriana

23:12.547 --> 23:14.014
scammed him all on her own?

23:14.016 --> 23:15.315
I told her not to do it.

23:15.317 --> 23:17.450
I told her that's not
what we're about.

23:17.452 --> 23:18.752
But you know
these kids today.

23:18.754 --> 23:21.255
They want things,
phones, cars.

23:21.257 --> 23:24.323
I'll bet that boyfriend of hers
pushed her into keep doing it.

23:24.325 --> 23:26.092
Adriana, why don't I take you
somewhere you can...

23:26.094 --> 23:27.494
Did you just hear what he said?

23:27.496 --> 23:29.228
Yes. I'm sorry...
I want to talk to him.

23:29.230 --> 23:30.930
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- I can't let him

23:30.932 --> 23:32.365
get away with that.
Adriana...

23:32.367 --> 23:34.667
I can't believe
you would do this to me, Papa.

23:34.669 --> 23:36.235
What is she doing here?
I saw you!

23:36.237 --> 23:38.837
You were gonna blame me
for your whole scam?

23:38.839 --> 23:39.838
Don't talk to me like that!

23:39.840 --> 23:40.907
Sit down, Mr. Polk.

23:40.909 --> 23:42.674
How could you, Papa?

23:42.676 --> 23:44.343
I didn't mean to, honey.
I'm sorry.

23:44.345 --> 23:46.212
You're not sorry.
The only thing

23:46.214 --> 23:47.813
that you're sorry for
is that you got caught.

23:47.815 --> 23:50.116
I got it.
I'll stay here.

23:50.118 --> 23:51.784
Adriana, wait.
Eddie, I'm sorry.

23:51.786 --> 23:52.437
It's fine, it's just...

23:52.461 --> 23:53.220
I shouldn't have
come in like that.

23:53.221 --> 23:54.686
Is Mr. Hatcher going
to press charges?

23:54.688 --> 23:56.187
He wants us
to keep him out of it

23:56.189 --> 23:58.156
to save him from
the embarrassment.

23:58.158 --> 23:59.691
But if you're
willing to testify

23:59.693 --> 24:01.326
against your father...
No, no, I can't.

24:01.328 --> 24:02.528
Why not?
You saw what he did.

24:02.530 --> 24:03.995
He just threw you
under the bus.

24:03.997 --> 24:05.263
I'm sorry, Eddie, I...

24:05.265 --> 24:06.799
He's family.

24:08.869 --> 24:11.036
I have to go.

24:17.978 --> 24:20.178
This badge--
can I use it for, like,

24:20.180 --> 24:22.347
an out if I get in
trouble with the law?

24:22.349 --> 24:24.582
Oh, no. You don't get
in trouble with the law.

24:24.584 --> 24:26.517
You're a smart kid,
a good kid.

24:26.519 --> 24:28.152
That's why you made
deputy-for-a-day.

24:28.154 --> 24:29.921
Maybe when you grow up,

24:29.923 --> 24:34.224
you'll join the department,
get yourself a real badge.

24:34.226 --> 24:35.493
Maybe I do.

24:35.495 --> 24:37.495
Captain,
Commissioner Reagan is here.

24:37.497 --> 24:39.797
Oh, as you were, please.

24:45.371 --> 24:47.671
I used to wear one of those.

24:47.673 --> 24:49.373
Oh. This is just a toy badge.

24:49.375 --> 24:50.807
I'm not a real cop.

24:50.809 --> 24:52.109
Fooled me.

24:52.111 --> 24:53.677
Commissioner Reagan, this
is our deputy-for-a-day,

24:53.679 --> 24:55.112
Tone Lane.

24:55.114 --> 24:56.746
Nice to meet you, Tone.

24:56.748 --> 24:59.116
You, too.

24:59.118 --> 25:01.451
Oh, so you're, like,
the boss of him, right?

25:01.453 --> 25:03.086
Like that, yeah.

25:03.088 --> 25:04.354
He's a good guy.

25:04.356 --> 25:05.956
You could take it from me.

25:07.258 --> 25:10.093
Tone, could, uh,
you do two things for me?

25:10.095 --> 25:11.127
Sure.

25:11.129 --> 25:12.796
Could you excuse us a minute,

25:12.798 --> 25:16.165
and would you come back
and see me when you turn 18?

25:27.112 --> 25:29.145
The operation's a go.

25:29.147 --> 25:32.215
We will provide logistical
and tactical support.

25:32.217 --> 25:34.449
And by “we,” I mean you.

25:34.451 --> 25:36.184
Yes, sir.

25:37.021 --> 25:38.621
I see you have questions.

25:38.623 --> 25:41.524
Did you share my concerns

25:41.526 --> 25:42.625
about the larger
community?

25:42.627 --> 25:44.059
I did, but if you want

25:44.061 --> 25:45.961
to show the community
you're with them,

25:45.963 --> 25:48.030
you need to be
out front in this,

25:48.032 --> 25:50.132
not hiding behind the blinds.

25:50.134 --> 25:52.000
And the U.S. Marshals
agreed to that?

25:52.002 --> 25:54.569
I saw to it they did.

25:54.571 --> 25:58.773
The NYPD will be the public face
of this operation.

26:00.911 --> 26:05.447
So, we went from assisting
an operation to leading?

26:06.517 --> 26:08.816
Look, I don't particularly
like the guy personally,

26:08.818 --> 26:12.554
but professionally,
he knows what his job is,

26:12.556 --> 26:15.590
and he knows how
to get the job done.

26:17.594 --> 26:20.061
Do you know what your job is?

26:20.063 --> 26:22.263
At its core?

26:23.699 --> 26:25.366
Yes.

26:25.368 --> 26:27.068
It's not about social services.

26:27.070 --> 26:28.802
It's not about
community outreach.

26:28.804 --> 26:31.038
It's not about turning
this precinct

26:31.040 --> 26:33.274
into a shining city on a hill.

26:33.276 --> 26:34.675
At its core,

26:34.677 --> 26:39.313
it is about taking criminals
off the streets.

26:40.382 --> 26:42.749
The rest is just icing.

26:42.751 --> 26:44.785
That's the cake.

26:46.321 --> 26:49.522
And your good numbers are not
the result of good feelings,

26:49.524 --> 26:52.559
they are the result
of good collars.

26:52.561 --> 26:54.760
A lot of them.

26:55.930 --> 26:58.231
That is all.

27:05.139 --> 27:07.006
I need some advice.

27:07.008 --> 27:08.273
Add some bacon.

27:08.275 --> 27:10.309
Bacon makes
everything better.

27:10.311 --> 27:12.344
Work advice.

27:13.147 --> 27:15.982
You want work advice from me?

27:15.984 --> 27:17.316
Don't get used to it.

27:18.152 --> 27:19.485
Let me guess.

27:19.487 --> 27:21.453
It's about
the Coryna Garza case,

27:21.455 --> 27:23.688
isn't it?
You knew about that?

27:23.690 --> 27:25.690
Yeah.

27:25.692 --> 27:27.659
Okay, shoot.

27:27.661 --> 27:29.694
Let's say you have a perp
or a witness

27:29.696 --> 27:30.862
and you're questioning him,

27:30.864 --> 27:32.063
and he is...

27:32.065 --> 27:33.698
honest to a fault.

27:33.700 --> 27:35.433
What goes through your mind?

27:35.435 --> 27:37.235
Okay, what do you mean

27:37.237 --> 27:40.138
by “honest to a fault”?

27:40.140 --> 27:42.306
That they're
painting themselves

27:42.308 --> 27:44.475
in the most
pathetic light,

27:44.477 --> 27:46.778
as if that shows how
truthful they're being.

27:46.780 --> 27:49.247
Could be that this person is

27:49.249 --> 27:51.616
so nervous about being in the
hot seat that they're willing

27:51.618 --> 27:53.651
to spill the beans about
anything and everything.

27:53.653 --> 27:56.287
Okay. Or?

27:56.289 --> 27:57.488
Or...

27:57.490 --> 27:59.357
could be like the guy
in the pool hall

27:59.359 --> 28:01.925
who goes out of his way
to let you see

28:01.927 --> 28:03.261
how bad of a pool player
he is,

28:03.263 --> 28:05.296
and the next thing you know
you're in a game with him,

28:05.298 --> 28:08.565
and boom, bap, zing,
you're out of 20 bucks.

28:08.567 --> 28:10.167
Truth is a hustle.

28:10.169 --> 28:11.802
Everything is a hustle.

28:11.804 --> 28:15.405
The key is to not be
the sucker born every minute.

28:19.779 --> 28:21.979
The term “grifter”
is a combination

28:21.981 --> 28:23.981
of “gypsy” and “drifter”"

28:23.983 --> 28:25.615
meaning a con artist.

28:25.617 --> 28:27.717
So it's like a,
uh, a mash-up

28:27.719 --> 28:28.316
Yeah, right.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.820
I don't think
the gypsy part's right, Pop.

28:29.821 --> 28:31.421
Sure it is.
Just 'cause we

28:31.423 --> 28:33.690
can't say “gypsy” anymore
doesn't mean...

28:33.692 --> 28:35.625
What are you supposed
to call them?

28:35.627 --> 28:37.194
Romani.
Doesn't mean that

28:37.196 --> 28:39.505
the word doesn't come
from “gypsy” and “drifter.”

28:39.506 --> 28:42.766
Actually, the term is a combination
of “drifter” and “grafter,”

28:42.767 --> 28:45.735
“graft” being an old word
for all sorts of corruption.

28:45.737 --> 28:48.137
Well, that's not what it
comes from where I come from.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.973
The sage of Bay Ridge
has spoken.

28:50.975 --> 28:51.774
Thank you.

28:51.776 --> 28:53.209
Graft usually refers

28:53.211 --> 28:55.477
to political corruption.
Not in England,

28:55.479 --> 28:56.779
where the term originated.

28:56.781 --> 28:58.146
Mm, mm, mm.

28:58.148 --> 29:00.349
So is a grifter
usually a lowlife?

29:00.351 --> 29:02.418
Not at all.
When I first came on the job,

29:02.420 --> 29:05.354
the best grift I ever saw was
by a bunch of prep school kids

29:05.356 --> 29:06.488
on the Upper East Side.

29:06.490 --> 29:08.257
Ah, the Greek Diner scam.

29:08.259 --> 29:10.125
Mm-hmm.
That was pretty clever.

29:10.127 --> 29:12.027
Yeah. See, what they
would do is they would go

29:12.029 --> 29:13.262
into a diner,
they'd sit down,

29:13.264 --> 29:15.663
and they'd order shakes
and burgers and fries,

29:15.665 --> 29:17.032
and then they'd get the check.

29:17.034 --> 29:18.566
But then they'd go
to the counter

29:18.568 --> 29:20.635
and order coffee
and get a second check for that.

29:20.637 --> 29:22.037
And then
they would take that

29:22.039 --> 29:23.638
to the cashier,
who was at the front,

29:23.640 --> 29:25.640
pay the check for the coffee,
Mm-hmm.

29:25.642 --> 29:29.711
and walk away from the whole
meal for, like, 75 cents.

29:29.713 --> 29:31.112
Sounds like you admire it.

29:31.114 --> 29:32.813
Yeah, I always thought
it was pretty clever.

29:32.815 --> 29:33.918
Except to the owner
of the diner.

29:33.942 --> 29:35.150
I know.

29:35.151 --> 29:37.318
My economics professor says
that the entire advertising

29:37.320 --> 29:39.086
and marketing industry
is a grift.

29:39.088 --> 29:40.855
He says it boils down
to selling people

29:40.857 --> 29:43.824
things they don't really need at
a price that they can't afford.

29:43.826 --> 29:45.960
You transfer
to Karl Marx College?

29:45.962 --> 29:47.527
The truth is

29:47.529 --> 29:50.998
there's a little grift involved
in every successful endeavor.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.133
Except the law.

29:52.135 --> 29:53.333
Oh, yeah, right.

29:53.335 --> 29:55.136
It's true-- there's always
an opposing lawyer

29:55.138 --> 29:56.270
to keep you honest.

29:56.272 --> 29:57.504
Oh, you heard it here first--

29:57.506 --> 29:59.240
no lawyer ever pulled
a fast one.

29:59.242 --> 30:00.107
What about cops?

30:00.109 --> 30:01.375
Cops have grifts.

30:01.377 --> 30:02.542
Loosely speaking.

30:02.544 --> 30:03.943
Like?

30:03.945 --> 30:06.045
Well, like,
uh, when someone's arrested,

30:06.047 --> 30:08.582
everybody thinks that they're
entitled to one phone call--

30:08.584 --> 30:09.849
it's actually three.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.918
So you don't tell anybody?
No.

30:11.920 --> 30:14.488
You do tell 'em... and
then you play good cop

30:14.490 --> 30:16.823
and you say, “Hey,
I feel your pain--

30:16.825 --> 30:19.259
make five or six if
you feel like it”"

30:19.261 --> 30:20.526
How's that a grift?

30:20.528 --> 30:22.762
The cop writes down the
name and the number,

30:22.764 --> 30:25.231
he makes the phone call,
he turns the phone over

30:25.233 --> 30:27.300
when the other
person's on the line.

30:27.302 --> 30:28.334
And?

30:28.336 --> 30:29.568
And?

30:29.570 --> 30:31.938
The cop now has a name
and best number

30:31.940 --> 30:34.707
for five or six of the perp's
nearest and dearest.

30:34.709 --> 30:38.377
The cop likes that perp for
another crime down the line...

30:38.379 --> 30:41.280
he already has a Rolodex
for him.

30:41.282 --> 30:42.682
What's a Rolodex?

30:43.551 --> 30:45.083
Wow.

30:45.085 --> 30:46.285
Oh, boy.

30:46.287 --> 30:50.088
Anyway, I'm not
saying be dishonest,

30:50.090 --> 30:52.224
boys, but you got
to play the game,

30:52.226 --> 30:53.992
otherwise you get eaten alive.

30:56.663 --> 30:59.131
Pass the potatoes.

30:59.133 --> 31:00.833
Thank you.

31:13.410 --> 31:14.844
Good morning.

31:17.081 --> 31:18.647
Was up to now.

31:18.649 --> 31:21.517
Homeland Security's gonna
arrest Coryna within the hour.

31:21.519 --> 31:22.751
And, uh,

31:22.753 --> 31:24.453
you want me
to pull some strings?

31:24.455 --> 31:27.055
No, I want you
to tell me the truth.

31:27.057 --> 31:28.623
I did.

31:28.625 --> 31:31.326
I never asked
for custody of my daughter.

31:31.328 --> 31:32.894
Don't want it.

31:32.896 --> 31:34.696
And I believe you.

31:34.698 --> 31:36.298
Then what?

31:36.300 --> 31:38.867
Bears repeating,
what I said the other day.

31:38.869 --> 31:42.337
If you stand to profit
in any way from the information

31:42.339 --> 31:44.438
you provided to DHS in regards

31:44.440 --> 31:46.875
to Coryna's immigration status,

31:46.877 --> 31:49.143
I can charge you
with hindering prosecution

31:49.145 --> 31:51.178
of my office's charges
against her.

31:51.180 --> 31:53.548
And I will.

31:55.619 --> 31:59.020
Day's gone from bad to worse,
and it's barely 10:00.

32:03.459 --> 32:05.592
Right after Coryna got arrested,

32:05.594 --> 32:08.795
couple of his guys came
and found me here in the bar.

32:08.797 --> 32:10.631
Ronald Tourneff's guys?

32:10.633 --> 32:12.699
They were looking
for dirt on her.

32:12.701 --> 32:14.801
I said I didn't have any.

32:14.803 --> 32:17.170
They showed me 50 grand

32:17.172 --> 32:20.473
in one of them reusable
supermarket bags.

32:20.475 --> 32:21.842
That's a lot of money.

32:21.844 --> 32:23.510
It's a lot of money to you--

32:23.512 --> 32:25.445
imagine what it is to me.

32:25.447 --> 32:28.582
It's enough to guarantee
your daughter loses her mother.

32:29.451 --> 32:31.518
Not exactly my train of thought.

32:31.520 --> 32:34.054
It is now, like it or not.

32:34.056 --> 32:36.489
You have it?
They said it was mine

32:36.491 --> 32:39.625
the moment DHS got
Coryna in custody.

32:40.628 --> 32:44.564
The exact moment
Nadia's world goes dark.

32:45.900 --> 32:48.367
You're a real treat,
you know that?

32:48.369 --> 32:49.902
Isn't it done?

32:49.904 --> 32:51.771
Not if you change course.

32:51.773 --> 32:53.873
To what?

32:53.875 --> 32:56.442
Testify on Coryna's behalf.

32:56.444 --> 32:58.310
Swear that she had no way

32:58.312 --> 33:00.612
of knowing she was illegal,
that you were in fact

33:00.614 --> 33:02.781
part of the conspiracy
to keep that information

33:02.783 --> 33:03.815
from her.

33:03.817 --> 33:05.250
Can I go to jail
for that, too?

33:05.252 --> 33:07.386
No.

33:07.388 --> 33:09.654
It'll be a brick
in your house in heaven.

33:16.396 --> 33:18.396
Can I call the judge?

33:18.398 --> 33:21.900
Can I tell him you're
gonna do the right thing?

33:35.915 --> 33:38.149
Lunch?
Sure.

33:40.253 --> 33:42.420
It was in his left ear.

33:42.422 --> 33:43.379
It was, wasn't it?

33:43.380 --> 33:44.715
Want to go back
and say hello?

33:44.716 --> 33:46.257
No.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.025
I'm done with all that.

33:48.027 --> 33:50.494
No more consulting
somebody else's intuition.

33:50.496 --> 33:53.931
Besides... I'm not the
pirate type, you know?

33:55.234 --> 33:56.934
Wait.

33:56.936 --> 33:59.637
Eddie,
not another psychic.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.772
Does that look like...

34:04.576 --> 34:06.343
It's Adriana.

34:06.345 --> 34:07.577
Eddie, wait.

34:07.579 --> 34:10.045
Your love line
is very long.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.547
Adriana?

34:11.550 --> 34:14.984
There's no one named Adriana
working here.

34:16.821 --> 34:18.554
Leonora?

34:18.556 --> 34:20.456
Does your guest want tea
as well?

34:20.458 --> 34:21.290
Leonora?

34:21.292 --> 34:22.391
No, Papa. Just for me.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.445
Papa? Wait,
I thought that...

34:23.469 --> 34:24.628
Oh.

34:24.629 --> 34:26.594
Hello. I'm Johnny Lovell.

34:26.597 --> 34:29.364
And who might I have the
pleasure of being introduced?

34:29.367 --> 34:32.268
Um, uh, we're...
We were just taking a look.

34:32.270 --> 34:33.803
Would you like
a reading? Have a seat.

34:33.804 --> 34:34.902
I'll get some tea.

34:34.905 --> 34:35.904
Maybe next time.

34:35.906 --> 34:37.273
But, wait...
We got run. Come on.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.241
We hope
to see you soon.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.275
What was that?

34:40.277 --> 34:41.842
She's like a whole
other person.

34:41.844 --> 34:43.911
From Adriana to Leonora
in one haircut.

34:43.914 --> 34:45.648
And that guy!
Johnny Lovell?

34:45.650 --> 34:47.716
He said <i>he</i>
was her papa.

34:47.717 --> 34:49.451
Guessing that's a loose term
in their culture.

34:49.453 --> 34:52.219
I thought it meant “father”
or “grandfather”.

34:52.222 --> 34:54.455
I... I'm guessing
it's a nickname

34:54.456 --> 34:57.258
for “my boss.”

34:57.260 --> 35:00.762
I seriously have
no idea what just happened.

35:00.764 --> 35:03.431
She used the scam with Hatcher
to get away from Nick.

35:03.433 --> 35:05.801
And I'm guessing
she gets to keep a bigger cut

35:05.803 --> 35:08.369
of what she earns
with Papa Johnny than she did

35:08.371 --> 35:09.337
with Papa Nick.

35:09.339 --> 35:10.805
Then why would she
include the cops?

35:10.807 --> 35:13.074
I think she needed
a big shakedown

35:13.076 --> 35:15.610
in her world
to get away from Nick.

35:17.947 --> 35:19.947
It was all a con.

35:19.949 --> 35:21.683
Yeah, I think so.

35:21.685 --> 35:24.085
What are we gonna do?
Could we arrest her?

35:24.087 --> 35:25.352
For what?
Hatcher still won't testify.

35:25.354 --> 35:26.854
What are we gonna
arrest her for?

35:26.856 --> 35:29.023
It's just...

35:29.025 --> 35:31.125
doesn't seem right.

35:33.129 --> 35:35.029
What is it? Are you okay?

35:36.332 --> 35:39.433
I'm seeing the future.

35:39.435 --> 35:40.500
You're buying lunch.

35:40.502 --> 35:42.102
Not funny.

35:42.104 --> 35:43.398
My favorite sushi place
is on 3rd.

35:43.422 --> 35:44.305
No.

35:44.306 --> 35:46.373
I'm so hungry.
It's not funny, Jamie.

35:53.649 --> 35:56.049
Wait, hold up, man!

35:56.051 --> 35:57.650
Get your hands off me!

35:57.652 --> 35:59.418
Get away...
Tell me what I do, man?

35:59.420 --> 36:00.653
What I do?!

36:11.332 --> 36:12.531
Status.

36:12.533 --> 36:13.899
We're missing
three targets,

36:13.901 --> 36:15.245
but we're still doing
verticals and rooftops.

36:15.246 --> 36:16.779
Otherwise, home run.

36:16.781 --> 36:18.915
I understand
there were casualties.

36:18.917 --> 36:19.782
All civilian.

36:19.784 --> 36:20.616
All criminals.

36:20.618 --> 36:21.617
Pending trial.

36:21.619 --> 36:23.318
This guy.

36:23.320 --> 36:26.088
One DOA at the scene; the rest
on the way to the hospital.

36:26.090 --> 36:28.223
How many you got in custody?
40 and counting.

36:28.225 --> 36:30.559
For a dozen targets?

36:30.561 --> 36:31.860
The way we fish?
Catch and release.

36:31.862 --> 36:33.728
They're not fish.
It's a figure of speech.

36:33.730 --> 36:36.131
They are citizens
of this neighborhood.

36:36.133 --> 36:37.433
Yeah, nice neighborhood
you got here.

36:37.435 --> 36:39.668
We have officers
in pursuit of a male black

36:39.670 --> 36:41.937
fleeing west
on the 300 block of Danvers

36:41.939 --> 36:43.939
wearing jeans and a gray hoodie.

36:43.941 --> 36:45.074
Who's got sight on him?

36:45.076 --> 36:46.240
Is he armed or unarmed?

36:46.242 --> 36:47.408
Unknown at this time.

36:47.410 --> 36:48.877
Let go!

36:50.346 --> 36:52.180
Hey! Stop! Hey!

36:52.182 --> 36:54.082
Move! I got to tell
them something!

36:54.084 --> 36:54.983
Stand down! I know him!

36:54.985 --> 36:56.451
Tell 'em, man.

36:56.453 --> 36:57.251
Stand down.

36:57.253 --> 36:58.219
All right, let him through.

36:58.221 --> 36:59.588
Come on.
Let him through.

36:59.590 --> 37:00.822
It's okay, it's okay.

37:00.824 --> 37:02.623
It's all right.
They got him.

37:02.625 --> 37:03.624
They got my brother.

37:03.626 --> 37:05.726
Wh-What do you mean “got”?
They shot?

37:05.728 --> 37:07.027
No, no. He got arrested.

37:07.029 --> 37:08.529
But he didn't do nothing.

37:08.531 --> 37:10.565
Just calm down. Talk to me.
Calm down?

37:10.567 --> 37:12.633
They cuffed him.

37:12.635 --> 37:14.202
He didn't do nothing.
Then he's gonna be out

37:14.204 --> 37:16.537
by lunch-- I don't want you
worrying about this now, okay?

37:16.539 --> 37:18.806
Come here, come here.
I'm gonna see to it personally.

37:18.808 --> 37:20.173
See to what?!

37:20.175 --> 37:22.342
They tackled him
and they cuffed him!

37:22.344 --> 37:24.845
You know what?

37:25.948 --> 37:27.748
I don't want it anymore.

37:40.362 --> 37:42.429
Wrong time,
wrong place.

37:42.431 --> 37:44.431
Shut up.

37:57.411 --> 38:00.046
Another one in the lost column.

38:00.882 --> 38:02.815
Yes, sir.

38:02.817 --> 38:04.917
He doesn't have
to stay there.

38:04.919 --> 38:06.485
And how do I change that?

38:06.487 --> 38:09.355
You already know how.

38:10.191 --> 38:12.291
Start from scratch?

38:12.293 --> 38:15.694
Yeah. That's the way
most of our days begin.

38:31.779 --> 38:34.046
Judge Gavin.

38:34.048 --> 38:35.180
I know him.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.982
I'm sure you do.

38:36.984 --> 38:38.717
He's on my side?
No,

38:38.719 --> 38:40.686
but he's willing
to review your status

38:40.688 --> 38:43.521
in light of recent...
revelations.

38:43.523 --> 38:45.590
What does that mean?

38:45.592 --> 38:46.658
It means

38:46.660 --> 38:48.626
with your aunt and your ex

38:48.628 --> 38:50.961
and anyone else
that you can find to testify,

38:50.963 --> 38:53.631
he might find a path
to citizenship for you.

38:53.633 --> 38:55.166
“Might”?
Yes.

38:55.168 --> 38:56.767
“Might”.

38:56.769 --> 38:58.569
It's your one shot.

38:58.571 --> 39:01.172
So let me be clear--
when we walk out of this church,

39:01.174 --> 39:03.774
it's up to you to prove
that you really were

39:03.776 --> 39:05.943
unknowingly illegal.

39:06.779 --> 39:08.579
I understand.

39:08.581 --> 39:10.915
Now, I made a deal
with my boss.

39:10.917 --> 39:14.551
If you do work it out
with DHS,

39:14.553 --> 39:16.920
I'm gonna haul you
back into court

39:16.922 --> 39:19.489
and prosecute you
to the full extent of the law

39:19.491 --> 39:23.059
for felony criminal mischief
and inciting to riot.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.895
I'm looking forward to it.

39:26.732 --> 39:28.198
Shall we?

39:29.568 --> 39:31.835
Hands behind your back.

39:42.180 --> 39:45.681
It's okay. It's okay!

39:45.683 --> 39:47.150
It's okay!

39:47.152 --> 39:49.885
You have kept up the fight,
and it is working.

39:49.887 --> 39:51.954
Thank you for having my back.

39:51.956 --> 39:53.723
<i>Gracias mi gente.</i>

39:53.725 --> 39:56.259
Keep up the fight!

39:56.261 --> 39:58.394
I love you, too!

40:01.466 --> 40:02.798
You, too!

40:02.800 --> 40:04.399
Don't give up!

40:04.401 --> 40:07.069
I'll see you again!
I'll see you again!
