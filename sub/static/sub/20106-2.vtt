WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:03.868
So, what are we doing?

00:03.869 --> 00:06.399
Are we just jumping
right into this, or...

00:06.405 --> 00:09.365
Not literally, you ass! You scared me half
to death! Ow! Ow! Will you... ow! Damn it!

00:09.374 --> 00:12.310
You idiot! Ow! Stop it!

00:12.311 --> 00:14.411
What is your... ow!

00:14.413 --> 00:16.151
I would like a drink, please.

00:16.152 --> 00:18.148
Ow. Join this great new club.

00:18.150 --> 00:20.880
Brandy, if you have it.
Fresh out, turns out.

00:20.886 --> 00:22.246
Good lord. You should have

00:22.254 --> 00:24.224
your underbutler fire
the housekeeper.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.492
Yeah, maybe after he's done

00:25.493 --> 00:27.821
getting the caviar stains
out of my spats.

00:27.826 --> 00:29.586
I was being facetious,
Mr. Archer.

00:29.595 --> 00:30.985
I... I know you're poor.

00:30.996 --> 00:34.096
Well, middle class.
This cannot be the middle.

00:34.099 --> 00:36.499
Look, miss... Vandertunt.

00:36.502 --> 00:38.742
Heiress to the vast Vandertunt
publishing fortune.

00:38.743 --> 00:42.007
Right. So, I've had a long day.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:52.351 --> 00:55.251
My partner was murdered.
My office was burgled.

00:55.254 --> 00:57.692
I pissed off two crime bosses
and a dirty cop,

00:57.693 --> 00:59.759
and crushed the ankles
of a psychopath who,

00:59.760 --> 01:01.758
just for kicks, melts people.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.290
So, as much as I would
genuinely like to,

01:04.296 --> 01:06.796
I'm afraid I don't
have time to kill you.

01:06.798 --> 01:09.428
You misunderstand me,
Mr. Archer.

01:09.434 --> 01:12.036
I want you to help me
fake my death.

01:12.037 --> 01:15.937
For which I am prepared
to offer you $10,000.

01:15.941 --> 01:18.109
Oh. And my body.

01:18.110 --> 01:19.710
The ten grand is plenty.

01:19.711 --> 01:21.951
I'm afraid
this is nonnegotiable.

01:23.214 --> 01:24.982
Do your worst.

01:24.983 --> 01:27.883
I will.

02:04.235 --> 02:07.235
So, when I said,
"do your worst"...

02:07.239 --> 02:10.139
I-I know. Sorry. Long day.

02:10.146 --> 02:13.007
Uh, plus my ear hurts?

02:13.016 --> 02:14.516
I have codeine!

02:14.518 --> 02:17.518
Because heirs to fortunes

02:17.521 --> 02:20.321
like your family's
don't fake their own deaths.

02:20.324 --> 02:21.754
They murder their parents

02:21.758 --> 02:24.258
and blame it on some poor
hispanic or negro.

02:24.261 --> 02:25.761
Yes, I thought about that,

02:25.762 --> 02:27.832
but I don't know
any hispanics or negroes.

02:27.833 --> 02:30.700
No, they make up
the hispanic or negro.

02:30.701 --> 02:32.271
I honestly wouldn't know
where to begin.

02:32.272 --> 02:34.529
Okay, but...
Boy, these are good.

02:34.538 --> 02:36.938
Mmm! Aren't they? 
- Zesty.

02:36.940 --> 02:38.340
But putting aside, for now,

02:38.342 --> 02:39.542
why you'd want to fake
your own death...

02:38.896 --> 02:41.796
Because I have to
get away from my family.

02:41.799 --> 02:44.299
They're a seething cauldron
of neurotic, alcoholic,

02:44.301 --> 02:47.701
narcissistic, quasl-Incestuous
megalomaniacs!

02:48.805 --> 02:50.135
How quasi?

02:50.140 --> 02:52.200
I don't know. A four?

02:52.209 --> 02:54.647
Out of what? Are you
going to help me or not?

02:54.648 --> 02:56.475
I... look, I really don't think

02:56.480 --> 02:58.210
you've thought this thing
through.

02:58.215 --> 03:01.045
Mm. For starters,
even if you pull this off,

03:01.051 --> 03:02.311
what are you gonna do for money?

03:02.319 --> 03:05.154
Well, I...
I shall work, of course.

03:05.155 --> 03:06.485
As what?

03:06.490 --> 03:08.490
Uh, one of those.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.592
A... food-perambulator.

03:10.594 --> 03:12.494
Well, my apologies.
I thought you were

03:12.496 --> 03:14.066
heading into this half-cocked.

03:14.067 --> 03:17.564
- Said the pot to the kettle.
- My ear hurt!

03:17.568 --> 03:19.006
You're not some runaway kid

03:19.007 --> 03:20.833
whose family couldn't
care less she's gone.

03:20.838 --> 03:22.238
They're gonna
be looking for you.

03:22.239 --> 03:24.509
So, to make this work,
you'd need a body.

03:24.510 --> 03:27.577
And not just any body.
A body your same size,

03:27.578 --> 03:30.116
same height and weight, your
same general bone structure.

03:30.117 --> 03:32.283
A body... I mean,
if you're gonna do

03:32.284 --> 03:33.742
what has to be done here,

03:33.751 --> 03:37.681
a body with your exact
same dental records.

03:37.688 --> 03:40.356
Who is that?

03:40.357 --> 03:42.857
I don't know!

03:42.860 --> 03:45.520
I mean, obviously she's a maid.
Really.

03:45.529 --> 03:48.199
I just don't know her name, because...
She's a maid?

03:48.200 --> 03:49.632
Obviously.

03:49.633 --> 03:50.693
Did you kill her?

03:50.701 --> 03:53.661
Wha... no! Jesus!

03:54.871 --> 03:56.471
My brother did.

03:56.473 --> 03:59.473
Well, technically, I suppose
the drunken abortionist did.

03:59.476 --> 04:01.776
But my brother got her pregnant
in the first place.

04:01.779 --> 04:03.648
And my father
would've killed her

04:03.649 --> 04:05.987
if she had refused
to get an abortion, so...

04:05.988 --> 04:08.383
But, I mean, not really? Really.

04:08.385 --> 04:09.815
Why do you think
my father started

04:09.820 --> 04:10.980
the Spanish-American war?

04:10.988 --> 04:13.488
Wasn't it sugar?
He got my aunt pregnant.

04:13.490 --> 04:17.450
And sugar? I guess. I don't know.
Shut up!

04:17.461 --> 04:20.221
The point is,
this poor girl was dead

04:20.230 --> 04:23.060
the minute her panties hit the straw.
The...

04:23.067 --> 04:24.634
In the stables. Ah.

04:24.635 --> 04:27.465
But want to know the best part?
That wasn't it?

04:27.471 --> 04:30.071
Look! What are you...
Uh, no, don't...

04:30.074 --> 04:32.404
Not one cavity, not one filling!

04:32.409 --> 04:35.078
Since when and how do you know that?
Don't you see?

04:35.079 --> 04:37.419
Her teeth are perfect.
My teeth are perfect.

04:37.420 --> 04:39.414
Ergo, this plan is perfect!

04:39.416 --> 04:42.485
I mean, dentally, maybe,
but if she just disappears?

04:42.486 --> 04:45.156
Think of her family.
Do you think I haven't?

04:45.157 --> 04:46.255
Yes. What?

04:46.256 --> 04:47.856
I think you haven't.

04:47.858 --> 04:49.758
If you help me do this,

04:49.760 --> 04:51.760
I'll make an anonymous payment
to her family

04:51.762 --> 04:53.522
for an additional $10,000.

04:53.530 --> 04:55.530
Um, how does that
bring them closure?

04:55.532 --> 04:58.201
It comes with a note
saying she's dead.

04:58.202 --> 05:00.102
Look, nothing we can do
will bring

05:00.104 --> 05:01.873
this poor girl back to life.

05:01.874 --> 05:04.602
I know, but...
Not even a voodoo priestess,

05:04.608 --> 05:06.608
flown here from Haiti
at great expense,

05:06.610 --> 05:08.710
and then every year,
on grandma's birthday,

05:08.712 --> 05:10.672
they throw it your face! Uh...

05:10.681 --> 05:12.281
So the best thing we can do now

05:12.282 --> 05:14.342
is to fill this car
to the rafters with dynamite

05:14.351 --> 05:16.851
and shove it over a cliff.

05:16.854 --> 05:19.184
That is literally
the worst thing we can do.

05:19.189 --> 05:20.957
Oh, right.

05:20.958 --> 05:23.528
Dynamite would blow her teeth
all over the stupid beach.

05:23.529 --> 05:25.867
Well, and...
And then what's the point?

05:27.965 --> 05:29.935
Exactly.

05:33.218 --> 05:34.548
So we'll fake the crash tonight,

05:34.553 --> 05:36.823
but first we're gonna plant
a few seeds.

05:36.824 --> 05:39.822
First of all,
if I wanted your seed...

05:39.825 --> 05:41.393
Seeds of deception.

05:41.394 --> 05:42.964
Oh, sorry.
I thought you meant...

05:42.965 --> 05:44.729
I know what you meant.

05:44.730 --> 05:46.400
What in god's name
are you doing?

05:46.401 --> 05:48.459
Scrooching down. Well, stop it!

05:48.467 --> 05:50.227
Stop that this instant!
You stop...

05:50.236 --> 05:53.296
Shut up. I don't want anybody
in dreamland to see me.

05:53.305 --> 05:54.745
Well, I don't want
anyone to see me

05:54.746 --> 05:56.908
being chauffeured by a dwarf!

05:56.909 --> 05:59.009
Yeah. Then we'd have to
find a dead dwarf

05:59.011 --> 06:01.311
and a tiny chauffeur uniform.

06:01.313 --> 06:03.748
Why? To... oh, never mind.

06:03.749 --> 06:05.249
But she can't be
dressed like a maid,

06:05.251 --> 06:06.921
so we need to put her
in your clothes.

06:06.922 --> 06:09.587
Right! Then we should
go to my hotel.

06:09.588 --> 06:11.918
Which is...

06:11.924 --> 06:14.424
Nice? Where...

06:14.427 --> 06:16.757
Oh! ...Is your hotel?

06:16.762 --> 06:20.202
The chesley, on sunset. That
wasn't so hard, was it?

06:20.203 --> 06:23.099
That's what I said.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.270
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on.

06:29.275 --> 06:30.942
Where's my tough guy?

06:30.943 --> 06:33.678
Huh? Where's my tough old Dutch?

06:33.679 --> 06:36.047
There he is.

06:36.048 --> 06:37.778
Huh? Now listen.

06:37.783 --> 06:40.351
Shut up and listen to me, okay?

06:40.352 --> 06:42.287
Because I know...

06:42.288 --> 06:44.388
I know this isn't,
you know, ideal,

06:44.390 --> 06:47.120
but you got to
pull yourself together!

06:47.126 --> 06:48.616
No, no. I'm sorry.

06:48.627 --> 06:50.187
That was a poor choice of words,

06:50.196 --> 06:51.956
but for Christ's sake, man.

06:51.964 --> 06:53.804
There's two dead men
walking around there

06:53.805 --> 06:55.699
who stole from me...

06:55.701 --> 06:59.370
I.E., my whores, and from you,
I.E., your feet!

06:59.371 --> 07:01.971
And you are gonna find them,

07:01.974 --> 07:04.312
and you are gonna
bring them to me,

07:04.313 --> 07:05.979
and then I'm gonna
make them wish

07:05.980 --> 07:08.378
they were in hell
with a case of the clap!

07:08.380 --> 07:10.310
How can I?

07:10.316 --> 07:12.576
They took my feet, Lenny.

07:12.585 --> 07:16.055
They took my Fee-ee-ee-ee-eet!

07:18.656 --> 07:20.316
Ow.

07:20.326 --> 07:21.986
Ow! Shut up.

07:21.994 --> 07:23.328
Sorry.

07:23.329 --> 07:24.729
I don't pay you to be sorry.

07:24.730 --> 07:26.500
I pay you to make
other people sorry.

07:26.501 --> 07:28.159
Now here.

07:28.167 --> 07:29.597
Do what he tells you.

07:29.602 --> 07:31.432
What who tells me?

07:31.437 --> 07:33.837
The guy that's gonna fix you.

07:33.839 --> 07:34.839
<i>Hello?</i>

07:39.345 --> 07:41.579
- What?
- Absolutely not!

07:41.580 --> 07:43.610
- Why not?
- I'm not gonna stuff

07:43.616 --> 07:45.676
that poor girl into my clothes,
in the trunk of a car,

07:45.684 --> 07:48.019
like so much... Forcemeat!

07:48.020 --> 07:50.620
So much what? Forcemeat.
Such as one might find

07:50.623 --> 07:53.093
in a quenelle, roulade,
or galantine.

07:53.094 --> 07:55.122
Well, now you're
just being obtuse.

07:55.127 --> 07:57.687
I'm being obtuse? Yes.

07:57.696 --> 07:59.526
As opposed to you,
who wants to parade

07:59.532 --> 08:01.201
a corpse through a hotel lobby

08:01.202 --> 08:03.370
just so you can dress her
in your room?

08:03.371 --> 08:05.369
Well, I'd hardly
call this a parade.

08:05.371 --> 08:07.441
Oh, good morning,
miss Vandertunt.

08:07.442 --> 08:09.039
Can I... help you?

08:09.041 --> 08:11.041
No. We're fine. No, thank you.

08:11.043 --> 08:13.643
My maid, whose name is, um...

08:13.646 --> 08:16.106
Bernice? Somewhat obviously.

08:16.115 --> 08:18.215
Bernice! Yes, Bernice.

08:18.217 --> 08:21.277
And she was dead drunk
in a nearby saloon.

08:21.287 --> 08:22.717
Poor thing.

08:22.721 --> 08:24.821
The curse of the Irish,
and so forth.

08:24.823 --> 08:27.061
Ah, jeez.
Well, let's get her inside.

08:27.062 --> 08:29.129
No! Oh, no.
Thank you. Thank you.

08:29.130 --> 08:31.488
No. We'll use this one.
No, no, no.

08:31.497 --> 08:33.957
That... that one's good.
Let's... No, this one!

08:33.966 --> 08:36.166
No! We are not going through

08:36.168 --> 08:38.498
a revolving door with Bernice.

08:38.504 --> 08:40.674
But it wastes so much
less air conditioning

08:40.674 --> 08:41.743
than a regular door.

08:41.744 --> 08:44.909
The regular door
is wide-ass open!

08:44.910 --> 08:47.240
Oh, right.
Well, then, what's the point?

08:47.246 --> 08:48.736
Exactly.

08:48.747 --> 08:50.177
Honestly,

08:50.182 --> 08:52.252
I don't know why
you're so angry.

08:52.253 --> 08:54.481
Which I think
is why I'm so angry.

08:54.486 --> 08:56.816
- And I can see why you would be.
- Oh, yeah?

08:56.822 --> 08:58.922
I mean, you don't think
I'm being unreasonable?

08:58.924 --> 09:01.259
No! I mean, no.. I mean...

09:01.260 --> 09:04.429
Because not only
did I pay a lot of money

09:04.430 --> 09:06.430
for those magical
disappearing whores,

09:06.432 --> 09:08.932
I also paid you a lot of money.

09:08.934 --> 09:10.434
Well, yes, but that was...

09:10.436 --> 09:13.166
I mean, that was more
to look the other way, so...

09:13.172 --> 09:15.202
Figuratively!

09:15.207 --> 09:16.767
Not literally,

09:16.775 --> 09:19.045
while those assholes
were taking my load!

09:21.880 --> 09:23.950
Do you have a cat?
I smell dander.

09:23.951 --> 09:25.849
<i>Now, you listen to me,
Figgis, you schnorrer.</i>

09:25.851 --> 09:27.181
You're gonna find my whores,

09:27.186 --> 09:29.046
and you are gonna find
the bastards who took my whores,

09:29.054 --> 09:31.292
and crippled
my right-hand man, or...

09:31.293 --> 09:33.360
Or... I'm just
spit-balling here...

09:33.361 --> 09:36.127
What if I just gave you
back the money?

09:36.128 --> 09:39.128
Because I do not want the money!

09:39.131 --> 09:42.631
That is why I exchanged the
money for goods and/or services,

09:42.635 --> 09:45.970
which is the core concept
of economics.

09:45.971 --> 09:47.801
Isn't it sugar?

09:47.806 --> 09:50.806
Or, like, scarcity... Of sugar?

09:50.809 --> 09:53.209
You got one week, Figgis.
Or else.

09:53.212 --> 09:56.247
Wow. Goosebumps.

09:56.248 --> 09:57.878
<i>A week?</i>

09:57.883 --> 10:00.483
How in the risen Christ am I supposed
to find them in a week? I...

10:00.486 --> 10:03.586
I don't even know where to think
about thinking to start looking!

10:03.589 --> 10:06.758
Okay, okay! Okay!

10:06.759 --> 10:09.727
Okay! Goddamn it!

10:09.728 --> 10:12.258
Okay. I got to go to work,
but I'll be back tonight.

10:12.264 --> 10:14.334
And when I get back, I
wouldn't mind if the place

10:14.335 --> 10:16.933
smelled like lemon pledge
and orange chicken.

10:16.935 --> 10:19.604
Mm, maybe Chinatown?

10:19.605 --> 10:22.674
Oh, yeah. Hey, and while we're
at it, why not regular China?

10:22.675 --> 10:24.509
Or maybe sarcastic island,

10:24.510 --> 10:26.240
off the coast of
that was uncalled for.

10:26.245 --> 10:28.780
Will you shut up? Gladly.

10:28.781 --> 10:31.511
And then ask yourself...
Cui bono?

10:31.517 --> 10:32.947
<i>What?</i>

10:32.951 --> 10:36.251
I said, "why was your
office ransacked?"

10:36.255 --> 10:38.024
Because somebody
killed my partner

10:38.025 --> 10:40.623
and he left an envelope
full of clues in the safe.

10:40.626 --> 10:43.926
Why on earth would he do that? What?
No, not the killer, my...

10:43.929 --> 10:45.929
And what on earth are you doing?

10:45.931 --> 10:48.131
Trying to offset
some of the blue.

10:48.133 --> 10:50.468
She looks like a-a rodeo clown.

10:50.469 --> 10:52.639
You've clearly
never been to a rodeo.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.138
Must you rob this poor girl

10:54.139 --> 10:56.708
of her very last
shred of dignity?

10:56.709 --> 10:59.609
You did that! You did that when
you stuffed her in the trunk

10:59.611 --> 11:01.781
of your Rolls-Royce,
you spoiled little...

11:07.051 --> 11:09.887
Wait. Really? Mm!

11:09.888 --> 11:10.888
Oh...

11:10.889 --> 11:12.489
Okay.

11:15.627 --> 11:18.227
Oh! Cover her face.

11:18.230 --> 11:19.897
Wait, what?

11:19.898 --> 11:22.128
I don't want her watching us.

11:22.134 --> 11:24.804
Oh. Okay.

11:27.171 --> 11:29.041
So...

11:30.742 --> 11:32.412
why did someone
murder your partner?

11:32.413 --> 11:34.581
That's what I'm trying
to find out.

11:34.582 --> 11:36.580
<i>Really? I would think who</i>

11:36.582 --> 11:38.651
<i>is much more important than why.</i>

11:38.652 --> 11:40.920
I... Because if you found
out who killed him,

11:40.921 --> 11:42.849
you could make them
tell you why.

11:42.855 --> 11:45.255
Wow, you're
a regular monsieur...

11:45.257 --> 11:46.917
And last night,

11:46.925 --> 11:49.927
whoever, or whoevers,
broke into your office

11:49.928 --> 11:52.158
presumably knew
you'd be elsewhere.

11:52.164 --> 11:55.767
I... huh? So, who knew
you wouldn't be there?

11:55.768 --> 11:58.428
Well, I mean, it was late
at night. There was no reason

11:58.437 --> 12:02.337
for anybody to think
I would be at the office, so...

12:02.341 --> 12:03.771
<i>You lost me.</i>

12:03.776 --> 12:05.366
<i>"Cui bono," you dummy.</i>

12:05.377 --> 12:09.037
It's Latin. It means
"to whose profit." So?

12:09.047 --> 12:13.347
So, who knew you
wouldn't be there?

12:13.352 --> 12:17.288
So, you big ox,
when trexler loses...

12:17.289 --> 12:19.459
Who gains?

12:28.701 --> 12:31.537
Oh, come now.
Don't be such a pout.

12:31.538 --> 12:33.168
I think getting Bernice
through the lobby

12:33.173 --> 12:36.333
went about as well
as could reasonably be expected.

12:44.350 --> 12:47.286
Sorry.

12:47.287 --> 12:49.857
Besides, if... If you don't
shut your fat mouth,

12:49.858 --> 12:51.786
it's gonna be you going
over that goddamn cliff

12:51.792 --> 12:53.222
instead of Bernice!

12:53.226 --> 12:55.356
Please!
Then you'd never get paid.

12:57.564 --> 12:59.564
It would be worth it.

12:59.566 --> 13:01.466
What's this?
Why have we stopped?

13:01.468 --> 13:04.637
To get some answers.
I won't be long. Stay here.

13:04.638 --> 13:06.638
I shall do nothing of the sort.

13:06.640 --> 13:08.974
Of course you shalln't.

13:08.975 --> 13:10.305
Why, the very idea...

13:10.310 --> 13:12.310
Sitting in a car in the street
like some sort of...

13:12.312 --> 13:14.812
Dirty cop. Well, or any
tradesman, really.

13:14.815 --> 13:16.545
Oh! I need you to stop talking.

13:16.550 --> 13:18.820
And when we get in there,
I need you to continue

13:18.821 --> 13:20.986
to stop talking to anybody.

13:20.987 --> 13:22.887
You're hurting me!

13:22.889 --> 13:26.329
And it's the highlight
of my day.

13:30.397 --> 13:31.897
Do what? What?

13:31.898 --> 13:34.166
What? What do you want?

13:34.167 --> 13:37.336
- Couple minutes with Mother.
- Knock yourself out.

13:37.337 --> 13:39.837
Well, I'm sorry
I can't be of more help

13:39.840 --> 13:41.340
to you, lieutenant, but...

13:41.341 --> 13:42.675
"Can't" and "won't"

13:42.676 --> 13:44.776
are two very different things,
Mother.

13:44.778 --> 13:47.847
And yet the end result
is still the same.

13:47.848 --> 13:49.114
Why, Mr. Archer.

13:49.115 --> 13:50.345
Mother. Archer.

13:50.350 --> 13:51.584
Figgis. Archer.

13:51.585 --> 13:53.185
Poovey. You look like shit.

13:53.186 --> 13:55.016
Couldn't sleep.

13:55.021 --> 13:58.091
Noisy house guests. What do
you mean, "house guests"?

14:00.594 --> 14:02.594
Stop it!
What are you doing here, anyway?

14:02.596 --> 14:04.596
I heard they did
a nice wedge salad.

14:04.598 --> 14:06.198
Ooh. We don't.

14:06.199 --> 14:08.437
Aw. And now that
we've settled that,

14:08.438 --> 14:10.265
if you two
will please excuse us?

14:10.270 --> 14:12.870
Okay, Mother,
but remember what I told you.

14:12.873 --> 14:14.873
<i>Remember what I told you.</i>

14:16.476 --> 14:19.606
It is just dandertown frolics.

14:20.713 --> 14:22.143
Move, dick!

14:22.148 --> 14:24.884
Slang for "detective,"
so not an insult!

14:24.885 --> 14:28.454
What is insulting is that you've
kept me waiting for ten hours.

14:28.455 --> 14:31.223
I... sorry. I've had a busy day.

14:31.224 --> 14:33.954
I'll bet. I've had
quite a busy day myself

14:33.960 --> 14:35.398
trying to shut down rumors

14:35.399 --> 14:36.795
I had anything to do with

14:36.796 --> 14:38.966
that bloodbath
down in Long Beach.

14:38.967 --> 14:40.565
I wouldn't say "bloodbath."

14:40.567 --> 14:43.067
Although, now that
I come to think of it,

14:43.069 --> 14:44.569
the easiest thing
would be to just

14:44.571 --> 14:47.406
tell len trexler it was you.

14:47.407 --> 14:49.077
That would be pretty easy.

14:49.078 --> 14:51.905
But I have another job for you.

14:51.912 --> 14:54.972
Great. Come back at midnight.
I'll give you the details.

14:54.981 --> 14:58.183
And don't be late again.
Um, okay.

14:58.184 --> 15:00.514
Anything else? Well, uh,

15:00.520 --> 15:02.858
it's just that
while I was down in Long Beach,

15:02.859 --> 15:05.656
somebody broke into my office
and tossed the place.

15:05.659 --> 15:07.997
And? And, well, I
mean, it's just,

15:07.998 --> 15:10.094
not many people knew
I wouldn't be there.

15:10.096 --> 15:12.765
In your office, late at night.

15:12.766 --> 15:14.366
Yes. And?

15:14.367 --> 15:17.937
And I will see you at midnight.

15:19.705 --> 15:22.935
No, it's just, what's
a society dame like you

15:22.943 --> 15:24.703
doing in a place like this?

15:24.711 --> 15:26.711
Leaving it. Let's go.

15:26.713 --> 15:29.443
Wha... rude! Bernice is waiting.

15:29.449 --> 15:30.949
Oh, right.

15:30.951 --> 15:32.021
Miss Kane!

15:33.953 --> 15:35.183
Archer.

15:35.188 --> 15:38.123
Wow. Fancy meeting
you here, huh?

15:38.124 --> 15:41.954
At my job? Yeah. I mean,
what are the odds?

15:41.962 --> 15:44.562
One to one? Yeah. I don't know.
Maybe.

15:44.564 --> 15:47.434
So, um...

15:49.301 --> 15:51.403
Yeah. So, uh, okay.

15:51.404 --> 15:53.534
See... see you around, or...

15:53.540 --> 15:56.075
Oh, my god!
You have a crush on her!

15:56.076 --> 15:57.743
What? No I don't. I...

15:57.744 --> 16:00.374
Yes, you do!
That was the cutest thing!

16:00.380 --> 16:04.416
And I think she has
a crush on you.

16:04.417 --> 16:07.247
No, she.. Wait. Really?
Absolutely!

16:07.253 --> 16:09.253
Why-why... why do you
think that? Did she...

16:09.255 --> 16:11.385
Just admit that you like her.

16:11.391 --> 16:13.331
Well, yeah. I mean, of course I..
Hey! Yeah.

16:13.332 --> 16:16.896
- Me and him?
- We just!

16:20.065 --> 16:22.334
What is wrong with you?

16:22.335 --> 16:23.665
Well, for one thing,

16:23.670 --> 16:25.610
I may be literally
starving to death.

16:25.611 --> 16:28.105
Clams! What?

16:28.108 --> 16:30.843
Oh, we should stop
for fried clams

16:30.844 --> 16:33.344
at one of those
darling little shacks.

16:33.346 --> 16:35.346
We're not
stopping for fried clams.

16:35.348 --> 16:37.178
There is a dead woman
in the trunk!

16:37.183 --> 16:38.783
Well, obviously, I meant after.

16:38.785 --> 16:40.955
Also, I think
we're being followed.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.914
What? We're not being followed.

16:42.922 --> 16:44.682
There aren't any headlights
back there.

16:44.691 --> 16:46.861
I think their headlights are off.
No, they're not,

16:46.862 --> 16:50.863
because it's pitch dark and
we're not being followed!

16:50.864 --> 16:53.424
I think we're being followed.
We're not being followed!

16:53.433 --> 16:55.933
And also, how have you
not been murdered?

16:57.369 --> 17:00.539
I think we're being f...

17:00.540 --> 17:02.640
We are not being followed!

17:02.642 --> 17:04.642
I am a trained
private investigator!

17:04.644 --> 17:07.204
If we were being followed,
I would know it!

17:07.213 --> 17:10.542
Fine. Then drive.
Actually, we're here.

17:11.951 --> 17:14.553
Sorry, Bernice. Won't be long.

17:14.554 --> 17:17.154
Okay. So, I'm gonna soak
the upholstery with gas,

17:17.156 --> 17:19.156
set a 20-second cordite fuse,

17:19.159 --> 17:20.898
then we'll put Bernice
in the driver's seat,

17:20.900 --> 17:22.223
jam a rock on the accelerator,

17:22.228 --> 17:24.897
light the fuse,
and then slam it into... oh!

17:27.901 --> 17:29.141
Archer!

17:34.640 --> 17:36.910
Shh!

17:40.979 --> 17:42.579
Wha...

17:44.818 --> 17:47.918
Sorry!
Our headlights don't work!

17:54.493 --> 17:57.863
So, you're just
straight-up crazy.

17:57.864 --> 18:01.194
Ow.

18:01.201 --> 18:03.869
Well? Are we doing this or what?

18:03.870 --> 18:05.610
Because if I don't
get some clams soon,

18:05.611 --> 18:08.235
I won't be responsible
for my actions.

18:10.542 --> 18:13.372
What? I told you
we were being followed.

18:13.379 --> 18:16.448
That was just a car
with broken headlights.

18:16.449 --> 18:18.884
It was a coincidence.

18:18.885 --> 18:21.855
Because we weren't
being followed!

18:25.225 --> 18:26.285
Goddamn it.

18:26.292 --> 18:28.252
