00:05.639 --> 00:07.608
[Payson] Previously on
Make It or Break It:

00:07.641 --> 00:10.711
The new coach going to the World
Championships is Sasha Belov!

00:10.744 --> 00:13.047
- [all cheering]
- I'm pregnant.

00:13.081 --> 00:14.682
We don't have to wait
to have our happy ending.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.684
We can just be together
right now.

00:16.717 --> 00:20.554
- Summer Van Horn,
will you marry me?
- [Summer] Yes.

00:20.588 --> 00:23.624
[Kaylie] Damon's label wants us
to record the song we wrote.

00:23.657 --> 00:27.095
I was totally blocked until you
rescued me and this album.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.597
Two people just click.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.299
Damon and I kissed.

00:33.634 --> 00:37.071
- We need to see Emily.
- She's on a bus to Las Vegas.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.107
She decided to have the baby.

00:43.744 --> 00:47.681
[man] So. Big day.

00:47.715 --> 00:51.219
Returning to The Rock for
a National Team practice.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.587
- How are you feeling?
- [Kaylie sighs]

00:53.621 --> 00:56.190
It's going to be weird
without Emily there.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.025
I feel like
this is all my fault.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.595
That she had unprotected sex
and got pregnant?

01:01.629 --> 01:03.164
How is that your fault?

01:05.233 --> 01:07.034
I told her I kissed Damon.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.203
I didn't know
that she was pregnant.

01:09.237 --> 01:12.273
And I was just trying to be
honest and I told her it would
never happen again.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.742
But she took off.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.511
She quit gymnastics
and left town.

01:17.545 --> 01:20.080
It sounds like you acted
with integrity.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.816
And you're not
responsible for Emily's choices.

01:22.850 --> 01:27.355
I guess. But seeing Emily
give up on this dream

01:27.388 --> 01:30.391
made me realize how quickly
it can all slip away.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.593
It made me realize
how much I want it.

01:32.626 --> 01:36.464
- Worlds is a major event.
- Huge.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.666
And girls who don't go to
Worlds don't go to the Olympics.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.068
On top of which, I've already
missed six weeks of training.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.437
You're not just
a little anxious?

01:44.505 --> 01:46.674
A little.

01:46.707 --> 01:50.278
But Sasha was named
National and World Team Coach.

01:50.311 --> 01:53.747
And, um... I know
he's going to have my back,

01:53.781 --> 01:56.217
and I know that
with him I can shine.

01:56.250 --> 01:59.787
You can.
Trust yourself, Kaylie.

01:59.820 --> 02:04.558
Your dream belongs to you
and no one can rob you of that.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.832
[rock music]

02:12.733 --> 02:14.368
This is more like it.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.570
The Rock back on top
and our coach in charge.

02:16.604 --> 02:20.274
[chuckles] Kelly Parker
must be in a tizzy.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.210
Wonder if she'll even make
the World Team.

02:22.243 --> 02:25.713
With Kaylie coming back,
Emily's spot's the only one
up for grabs.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.782
Who cares. We three just need to
focus on each other right now.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.651
The closer we get
to the Olympics,
the greater the stakes,

02:30.684 --> 02:36.390
the higher the pressure,
the more we need
each other's support.

02:36.424 --> 02:37.458
Mmm-hmm. Totally.

02:38.726 --> 02:40.228
Hey, Max.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.795
Is it true?
Emily's pregnant?

02:43.497 --> 02:46.834
- [sighs] I heard she took off.
- Also, true.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.836
But the good news is that
Kaylie's coming back today.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.539
And she needs
everyone's support.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.607
I don't know.
You really think she's ready?

02:53.641 --> 02:56.710
Yes, I do. Austin, she's been
cleared by all of her doctors.

02:56.744 --> 03:00.248
And she doesn't need you or
anyone messing with her self
confidence.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.483
It's hard enough as
it is to make a comeback.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.652
Believe me, I know.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.754
So are you supporting
her return or not?

03:35.483 --> 03:37.285
- Welcome home!
- Kaylie, you're back!

03:37.318 --> 03:38.752
[Payson] It's so good
to see you!

03:38.786 --> 03:41.589
[Lauren] Oh my God,
we missed you so much.

03:41.622 --> 03:45.225
Just like old times.
The Three Musketeers.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.794
Has anyone heard from Emily?

03:47.795 --> 03:49.730
We can't dwell on what
might have been.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.565
We've got to move forward.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.702
That's right.
I mean, we're all still here.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.371
Yeah. Now is not
the time to slack off.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.772
We have to work
harder than ever.

03:58.806 --> 04:02.676
Well, we can have
a tiny bit of fun.

04:03.877 --> 04:04.978
I have great news.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.682
Summer's getting married!

04:08.716 --> 04:11.452
- To who?
- My dad,
thank you very much.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.687
And those are the invites
to her shower.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.657
But keep it on the DL,
it's a surprise.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.726
I guess this means that
Summer's totally over Sasha?

04:18.759 --> 04:19.893
Of course, she is.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.695
The shower's next
Friday, at my house,

04:21.729 --> 04:25.299
and the theme is "Pretty in
Pink." Won't that be fun?

04:25.333 --> 04:27.468
[Lauren giggles]

04:30.037 --> 04:32.806
I'm ready for you.
They are, I mean.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.912
- Is there something else?
- What? No. Why?

04:38.946 --> 04:42.249
It just seems like there's
something on your mind.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.818
Oh, well, uh...

04:46.420 --> 04:47.688
I'm happy, for you,

04:47.721 --> 04:50.458
that the NGO finally
came around to realizing

04:50.491 --> 04:52.893
that you're the right coach
for the National and World Team.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.562
You deserve it.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.796
I'm not entirely sure
I deserve it,

04:55.829 --> 04:58.999
but I intend to be
worthy of it. Thank you.

05:00.368 --> 05:04.672
Well, uh... Have a nice,
um, press conference.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.643
[man] Kelly, looking good.
Great to have you back.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.945
- [indistinct chattering]
- [camera shutters clicking]

05:14.582 --> 05:18.586
Oh look,
Satan's spawn is here.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.287
Poor Tessa, she's only 14.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.756
[sighs] The young ones
make better disciples.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.825
- Kaylie!
- Don't let her rattle you.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.361
What a surprise to see
you back. How was rehab?

05:27.395 --> 05:28.729
What are you talking about?

05:28.762 --> 05:31.765
On your "ACL tear." What else
did you think I meant?

05:31.799 --> 05:33.367
Kaylie's never been better.

05:33.401 --> 05:36.537
Too bad they don't have rehab
for Emily's condition.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.038
You're acting pretty cocky

05:38.071 --> 05:40.441
considering you haven't even
made the World Team.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.676
- [scoffs] I will.
- Don't be so sure.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.479
Our coach is now in control
of this team.

05:45.513 --> 05:50.350
And I think we all
know, he's not a fan.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.919
[Sasha] If I can have
your attention?

05:51.952 --> 05:54.788
I would like to thank the press
for coming today.

05:54.822 --> 05:57.758
I'm very excited by this
National and World Team.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.428
And I'm very honored to have
been chosen as their coach.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.695
[woman] Coach Belov,
speaking of Worlds,

06:01.729 --> 06:04.465
who's taking Emily Kmetko's
spot, now that she's quit?

06:04.498 --> 06:05.599
Kelly Parker.

06:05.633 --> 06:08.402
[gasps]
You were saying?

06:08.436 --> 06:10.904
We see National Champion
Kaylie Cruz is here today.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.873
Rumor has it
that her ACL has healed,

06:12.906 --> 06:14.875
does this mean she'll be
competing at Worlds?

06:16.944 --> 06:19.813
No. I'm sorry to announce,
Kaylie Cruz

06:19.847 --> 06:21.449
will not be ready to
compete at Worlds.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.585
[man] Who'll be replacing her?

06:24.618 --> 06:26.053
I haven't made that
determination yet.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.087
Next question.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.824
And I think the results will
speak for themselves.

07:03.857 --> 07:04.858
Thank you.

07:05.659 --> 07:06.794
[Kaylie] Sasha!

07:06.827 --> 07:09.162
I am ready,
that's why I'm back.

07:09.196 --> 07:12.132
- You've been out
for six weeks, Kaylie.
- I need to go to Worlds.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.735
No, what you need to do is keep
your focus on the Olympics.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.937
- That's the goal.
- [Kaylie] If I don't compete
at Worlds,

07:16.970 --> 07:19.039
the NGO won't even consider me
for the Olympic Team.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.808
They've made exceptions
in the past.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.810
But, I'm not an exception.

07:22.843 --> 07:26.079
I'm the National Champ
and I earned my spot
on the World Team.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.115
And if you go to Worlds
and perform poorly,

07:28.148 --> 07:30.718
it will irrevocably hurt
your chances at the Olympics.

07:30.751 --> 07:33.921
It's just simply more prudent
to play it safe.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.091
Since when have you ever
played it safe?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.594
Since I'm the
National Team Coach.

07:40.628 --> 07:42.763
Look, I can't allow my affection
for you to cloud my judgment.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.097
You need to trust me.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.733
You will remain
on the National Team,

07:45.766 --> 07:48.035
but you'll not
be going to Worlds.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.973
Oh, excuse me.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.110
He can't do this!
It's not fair!

07:57.144 --> 08:00.714
How can he say your spot is up
for grabs? Kay, that's your
spot.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.817
I trust Sasha,

08:03.851 --> 08:06.086
if he doesn't
think I'm ready, then...

08:06.119 --> 08:07.120
maybe I'm not.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.822
No, all that matters
is what you think!

08:08.856 --> 08:12.092
Trusting only what I thought,
almost killed me.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.762
Sasha knew I had a problem
before, and I denied it.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.831
I'm sorry if this is
hard for you, but my recovery

08:17.865 --> 08:21.201
depends on accepting that
I can't be objective about
myself.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.709
So, let's cut to the chase,
I'm not your favorite gymnast

08:28.742 --> 08:29.843
and you're not
my favorite coach,

08:29.877 --> 08:33.013
but why spend time
dwelling in the negative?

08:33.046 --> 08:35.148
I am the former World Champion
so I'm counting on you

08:35.182 --> 08:37.250
not to play favorites
with your Rock girls.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.086
And since I'll be
the team captain,

08:39.119 --> 08:41.121
I'll conduct all the
press-related interviews

08:41.154 --> 08:43.056
because the fans want to follow
a star and well,

08:43.090 --> 08:44.858
that's what I am.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.995
Also, I think Tessa Grande
should fill Kaylie's spot.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.031
She's young, talented
and has no ego issues.

08:52.299 --> 08:55.068
Well, I'll take your
endorsement under consideration.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.204
In the meantime, the girls will
pick their own team captain

08:57.237 --> 08:59.206
and the press will interview
whomever they choose.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.108
But you can rest assured
I have no intention

09:01.141 --> 09:02.009
of playing favorites
with anyone,

09:02.042 --> 09:04.945
including you.

09:04.978 --> 09:08.081
You know, it really is
so sad about Emily,

09:08.115 --> 09:11.184
but I hope you
don't feel responsible.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.220
Even if you hadn't taken a
sudden leave of absence

09:13.253 --> 09:15.322
I'm sure she still
would have lost her way.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.130
[rock music]

09:36.009 --> 09:38.111
What's the deal with Payson?

09:38.145 --> 09:39.079
What do you mean?

09:39.112 --> 09:42.082
I don't know.
She runs hot and cold.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.550
At least
where I'm concerned.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.018
Maybe because
you're all over Lauren.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.154
Hey, she's all over me.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.856
[Austin] Look, Lauren's hot,
I get it,

09:48.889 --> 09:50.758
but if you want Payson, you're
going to have to pursue her.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.761
If you want her to warm up
you're gonna have to give a
reason to.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.962
Bust a move.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.869
[Sasha] Can all National
Team members gather?

10:05.806 --> 10:08.208
The next three days
are National Team practices.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.077
And I know you're all curious
to find out

10:10.110 --> 10:13.046
who's going to fill Kaylie's
spot on the World Team.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.848
So am I.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.184
It could be any one of you who
aren't already on the team.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.020
So think of these next few
days as an audition.

10:20.053 --> 10:23.023
At the end of which
I will invite two girls

10:23.056 --> 10:24.858
to stay on with the World
Team to continue training.

10:24.892 --> 10:27.795
And from those two girls, I'll
ultimately choose the winner

10:27.828 --> 10:29.797
and who will be an alternate.

10:29.830 --> 10:33.033
Here is a list of compulsories

10:33.066 --> 10:37.070
for strength, flexibility,
and skill.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.873
But they don't have
compulsories at Worlds.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.742
These are my compulsories.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.210
I'll use these
as a way to determine

10:43.243 --> 10:45.278
which two girls stay
to compete for the final spot.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.049
Now, one more thing.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.753
An elite member of our team
has left us.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.723
She left us because
she couldn't maintain the focus

10:55.756 --> 10:58.158
or the discipline
this sport demands.

10:58.191 --> 11:02.796
She wanted to do the sport
her way and not my way.

11:02.830 --> 11:07.200
So is there anyone else,
standing right here, who feels
the need to do things their way?

11:07.234 --> 11:09.169
If so, step forward.

11:12.773 --> 11:15.375
Good. We're on
the same page then.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.044
Get to work
on the compulsories.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.780
I want to see them
executed flawlessly.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.115
Sasha.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.253
What am I supposed to do?

11:26.286 --> 11:27.420
Light conditioning.

11:27.454 --> 11:31.024
We need to focus
on building back your stamina,

11:31.058 --> 11:33.293
so no skills right now,
not until I'm sure you're ready.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.309
Is he serious
with all this conditioning?

11:49.342 --> 11:50.844
I mean we're not
in the Army.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.112
Poor Lauren,

11:52.145 --> 11:54.414
are you afraid you
won't be able to keep up?

11:54.447 --> 11:56.917
Luckily, Carter helped me
get ready,

11:56.950 --> 11:59.152
so my endurance and
flexibility are perfect.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.416
[sighs] I know
you're disappointed.

12:31.952 --> 12:35.055
You just need to give it time,
be patient.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.391
You and I both know
I don't have time to be patient.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.060
The Olympics
are around the corner

12:40.093 --> 12:42.095
and Worlds are
an important stepping stone.

12:42.129 --> 12:45.365
If I'm sidelined too long...
[sighs]

12:45.398 --> 12:47.234
...I might just be out.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.038
So what are you gonna do?

12:52.172 --> 12:54.007
[deep sigh]

12:54.041 --> 12:55.775
I'm going to do it his way.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.211
Do I have a choice?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.850
Hey, I'll see you
at your house later.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.217
Your dad's not coming
back till next week.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.819
Oh, great!

13:05.853 --> 13:06.954
How 'bout we order in tonight

13:06.987 --> 13:08.221
and hit those bridal mags?

13:08.255 --> 13:10.157
There's so many
decisions to make

13:10.190 --> 13:11.758
starting with
picking out your dress.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.094
And you need to
register, like ASAP,

13:14.127 --> 13:16.196
in case someone
throws you a shower and...

13:16.229 --> 13:18.899
OK, Lauren,
just relax, please.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.834
There is no need
to rush this wedding,

13:20.868 --> 13:23.904
your father and I, we
want to take our time...

13:23.937 --> 13:25.338
Where's my ring?
Why aren't you wearing it?

13:25.372 --> 13:26.874
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

13:26.907 --> 13:28.808
No, of course not.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.177
Everything's fine.

13:30.210 --> 13:33.346
I'm just waiting to tell
everyone in my own time.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.349
Everyone? Everyone, like who?
Like Sasha?

13:38.285 --> 13:40.520
Yes, like Sasha.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.222
Well, if it's too awkward for
you then I can just do it.

13:42.255 --> 13:46.259
No, that is
totally unnecessary.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.096
Oh, and, um...

13:49.129 --> 13:51.498
It is really
sweet of you,

13:51.531 --> 13:55.535
but I absolutely do not
want a shower, it's just...

13:55.568 --> 13:57.204
It's not my thing.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.253
Oh, Mrs. Keeler!

14:16.156 --> 14:17.891
What's this?

14:17.925 --> 14:21.194
Just an invite to Summer's
surprise wedding shower.

14:21.228 --> 14:24.331
Wow. This certainly
is a surprise.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.233
I guess Summer said yes.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.436
Of course she did.
Why wouldn't she?

14:29.469 --> 14:32.172
In fact, she wants the wedding
to happen right away,

14:32.205 --> 14:33.840
so forget the date
on that invite,

14:33.873 --> 14:36.443
I'm moving her shower up
to this Friday instead of next.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.480
OK then.
I'll be there.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.155
[acoustic guitar]

14:53.226 --> 14:54.627
What are you doing?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.096
Uh, recording.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.367
No, I mean, why are you here
and not with Emily?

15:05.472 --> 15:07.174
Damon, what's going on?

15:07.207 --> 15:10.310
How should I know?
She shows up at my door,

15:10.343 --> 15:12.512
all excited about
how great this was,

15:12.545 --> 15:15.248
and how we can finally have our
happily ever after now.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.916
She didn't even ask me
what I wanted.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.286
She says she's
gonna go home and pack.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.487
And I never hear
from her again.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.588
Well, have you tried
to call her?

15:21.621 --> 15:22.622
Yeah, of course I have.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.024
She won't answer my calls

15:24.057 --> 15:25.425
and her mom says she doesn't
want to speak to me.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.328
You know, I'm sick of
all these games.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.000
- She left town.
- Wait, what? Why?

15:33.033 --> 15:34.467
Because I told her we kissed.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.270
I feel so horrible. I thought
I was doing the right thing.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.271
I told her it didn't mean
anything but...

15:38.305 --> 15:42.242
Wait, it didn't...
It didn't mean anything?

15:45.045 --> 15:46.246
You need to go to her.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.282
You have to make Chloe
tell you where she is.

15:49.316 --> 15:52.452
You do want to know
where she is, don't you?

15:56.356 --> 15:59.159
[rock music]

16:02.162 --> 16:03.163
[Max] Hey!

16:04.364 --> 16:05.598
I didn't know
you ran this trail.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.234
[Payson] Actually, you did.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.935
I told you I run this route
every morning

16:08.968 --> 16:10.370
at exactly this time.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.404
[Max] Yeah, I guess you did.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.373
Look, I know you're
dating Lauren.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.574
Who said I'm dating Lauren?

16:14.607 --> 16:16.409
You guys are all over
each other at the gym

16:16.443 --> 16:18.478
and I saw those pictures
you took of her.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.314
You're obviously into her,
so go for it.

16:21.348 --> 16:25.185
You have my blessing.
Just leave me out of
whatever game you're playing.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.722
[music gets louder]

16:44.237 --> 16:46.005
[Sasha] Great job, Lauren.

16:46.039 --> 16:49.342
I think you have a real chance
to individually medal at Worlds.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.244
And I think I have a very
special vault for you

16:51.278 --> 16:53.012
that could make it gold.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.455
Get down. Immediately.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.226
I said you weren't ready
to work on any skills.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.595
I know, I just thought
I'd do a simple...

17:10.197 --> 17:12.031
I'm sorry,
it won't happen again.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.233
It better not.

17:18.705 --> 17:22.142
Sasha, that was
an elementary skill,

17:22.175 --> 17:23.343
Kaylie can do that
in her sleep.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.044
Aren't you being
overly cautious?

17:25.078 --> 17:27.380
You girls have all proven
you don't know your own limits.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.516
So for your own good,
it's my job to set them.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.519
[Sasha] All right, let's see it.

17:35.555 --> 17:39.326
So, Summer... anything new?

17:39.359 --> 17:41.628
Nothing. Why?

17:41.661 --> 17:47.667
No reason.
Just wondering if you had
any news about anything?

17:51.638 --> 17:53.273
Look, I know you're engaged.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.175
Who told you?

17:55.208 --> 17:56.509
A little birdie named Lauren.

17:56.543 --> 18:00.480
Oh, Kim, I'm so sorry,
of course I would have told you,

18:00.513 --> 18:03.350
I just... I wasn't ready
to make the big announcement

18:03.383 --> 18:05.218
with all the fuss people make.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.554
Well, I hate to be
a party pooper here,

18:07.587 --> 18:10.790
but I think you should know,
Lauren is throwing you
a surprise shower.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.059
- Oh, no.
- This Friday.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.529
Oh, I feel horrible, I told her
I didn't want a shower.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.498
Well, it's obvious.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.234
She's really excited about
having you as a stepmom.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.203
I know. It's sweet.

18:23.236 --> 18:26.706
How about you? Are you
excited about marrying Steve?

18:26.739 --> 18:29.709
Yes. Of course.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.711
Why wait to tell people then?

18:31.744 --> 18:33.480
Unless "people"
are really Sasha?

18:38.551 --> 18:40.287
I'm waiting for
the right moment.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.455
Well, I hate to tell you,

18:42.489 --> 18:44.291
but there really is never
a right moment

18:44.324 --> 18:46.259
to tell a man you
deeply care for

18:46.293 --> 18:47.760
that you're
marrying someone else.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.443
May I come in?

19:09.716 --> 19:11.784
You're angry.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.553
Ya' think?

19:13.586 --> 19:16.556
My seventeen-year-old
daughter is pregnant,

19:16.589 --> 19:18.691
because you, who are nineteen,

19:18.725 --> 19:21.361
didn't have common sense
to use protection!

19:21.394 --> 19:22.695
I feel terrible about that.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.698
Oh! You feel "terrible." Oh
well then, all's forgiven,
Damon.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.567
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to say

19:27.600 --> 19:29.602
that you're going to take full
responsibility for your actions.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.404
She's the one who ran away.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.506
Because you kissed another girl.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.576
After she broke up with me.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.646
You think it's easy
loving Emily?

19:39.679 --> 19:42.649
She has pushed me and pulled me
since the day that we met

19:42.682 --> 19:46.185
and now she has some crazy idea
that being teen parents

19:46.219 --> 19:48.221
is some sort of happy ending.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.290
I have dreams too.
What about my album?

19:50.323 --> 19:51.491
My career?

19:52.859 --> 19:54.861
It's always about her.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.364
Well, it's not about either
one of you anymore.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.599
It's all about this baby now.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.901
Emily's made her choice to have
this baby with or without you.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.570
So, you need to
make your choice.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.373
I'm not ready to be a father.

20:06.406 --> 20:09.242
And She's not ready to be
a mother. But here we are.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.654
[rock music]

20:29.962 --> 20:31.531
What is wrong with you?

20:31.564 --> 20:33.266
I'm sorry, I don't know why
I'm missing it.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.734
Well, you better
figure it out and fast.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.235
I need you
to get that spot.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.671
I can't even look at you.

20:44.010 --> 20:47.280
Hey, you're not that far off
from getting it,

20:47.314 --> 20:49.382
you're releasing
a little early.

20:49.416 --> 20:52.585
Wait until your
body just passes being parallel
to the ground. Then let go.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.421
You'll make it every time.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.823
Come on, give it a try,
I'll spot you.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.038
[Kaylie] Come on, Tessa.

21:15.675 --> 21:16.909
That's great!

21:16.943 --> 21:19.546
- Yay, you got it!
- Thanks.

21:21.581 --> 21:24.484
So, not only are you letting
your spot be taken away,

21:24.517 --> 21:25.952
but now you're helping
to fill it?

21:25.985 --> 21:27.654
Payson, I know you
don't understand.

21:27.687 --> 21:30.657
You're right. If being honest
with everybody is part of your
recovery,

21:30.690 --> 21:32.659
then I want you
to be honest with yourself.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.495
Do you really think you can't
be physically ready for Worlds?

21:35.528 --> 21:36.763
Sasha has the final word.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.565
He does if you don't
put up a fight.

21:38.598 --> 21:41.401
If you try and you're not ready,
then that's fine.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.802
But don't sit
by the sidelines

21:42.835 --> 21:45.372
and passively watch someone else
take your dream away.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.507
Look, I don't think
I can trust myself.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.809
How will you know
if you don't test yourself?

21:51.778 --> 21:52.845
[door opens]

21:53.613 --> 21:54.847
What is he doing here?

21:56.416 --> 21:58.518
Uh, I'll be right back.

22:05.492 --> 22:07.627
[sighs] Wow, what a tool.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.729
First he knocks up Emily

22:09.762 --> 22:12.031
and now, rumor has it,
he's hooking up with Kaylie.

22:14.634 --> 22:17.704
In her fragile state?
It's absolutely shameful.

22:21.908 --> 22:24.544
So, Emily's mom told me
where she is.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.379
I'm going to be there for her,
and the baby.

22:26.413 --> 22:28.581
You're doing the right thing.

22:28.615 --> 22:31.651
And Damon, promise me that
you'll finish your album.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.953
You can find a way to do both,
I know you can.

22:33.986 --> 22:34.987
I don't know...

22:35.021 --> 22:37.490
Damon, you were born to do this,

22:37.524 --> 22:39.526
don't give up
on your dreams, not ever.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.860
You have to fight for them.

22:42.695 --> 22:46.132
I'll make you a deal, if I
promise to fight, will you?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.603
OK. I promise.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.973
Thank you, Kaylie,
for everything.

22:54.006 --> 22:57.544
You are so special.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.111
You made me believe
in myself again.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.014
Come here.

23:05.017 --> 23:08.588
- [Austin] Hey, Young!
- Austin, no!

23:08.621 --> 23:11.023
What the hell is wrong with
you?! You already ruined one
girl's life!

23:11.057 --> 23:13.359
You don't know
what you're talking about!

23:13.392 --> 23:14.461
It's OK.
Maybe I deserved that.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.628
Damn right you did.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.931
Goodbye, Kaylie. Take care.

23:23.035 --> 23:25.071
- What is wrong with you?!
- I'm protecting you.

23:25.104 --> 23:28.007
I am not your sister!
Do you understand me?

23:28.040 --> 23:30.877
I don't need you to save me!
I can take care of myself!

23:30.910 --> 23:34.113
- You're still in recovery.
- Exactly! I'm in recovery.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.015
And how am I supposed to know
what I'm capable of

23:36.048 --> 23:39.619
if nobody gives me a chance?
I deserve a chance, Austin!

23:46.759 --> 23:48.461
I'm ready to fight.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.506
[Payson] So, that's
the floor compulsory,

23:59.539 --> 24:01.774
and you'll end with a handspring
front one and a half twist.

24:01.808 --> 24:04.544
And a round off back
one and a half punch front.

24:04.577 --> 24:07.614
- Easy-peezy, right?
- For you maybe.

24:07.647 --> 24:08.815
I've been on
vacation for six weeks.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.783
You can do it.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.485
And we'll be helping you
all the way.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.621
And once Sasha sees
that you can and will

24:14.654 --> 24:17.089
be ready for Worlds, he won't
hesitate to put you back on the
team.

24:17.123 --> 24:20.593
OK, so how do we
go about this?

24:20.627 --> 24:23.530
If Sasha sees me doing any
tricks in the gym, he'll flip.

24:23.563 --> 24:27.066
Not if he's not there when you
do them. Like at night.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.738
- I made a copy of Summer's key.
- [both laugh]

24:31.771 --> 24:33.005
What if we get caught?

24:33.039 --> 24:34.741
We apologize.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.809
Sasha's making his
decision in two days,

24:36.843 --> 24:37.810
we don't have a choice.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.812
And it's not like we're
breaking in to party.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.017
OK, um... [sighs]

24:45.051 --> 24:47.587
- When do we start?
- Now.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.221
Nobody should be there.
Let's go.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.036
Pay, is that you?

25:08.875 --> 25:12.845
[Kaylie chuckles] It sure is.
Who took it?

25:12.879 --> 25:13.913
[Lauren] Max.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.549
[chuckles]

25:19.819 --> 25:21.954
[rock music]

25:26.693 --> 25:29.729
* Follow the leader
Stay in the lines *

25:29.762 --> 25:32.965
* What will people think of
what you've done this time? *

25:32.999 --> 25:36.002
* Play it safe
Play by the rules *

25:36.035 --> 25:39.205
* Or don't play at all
What if you lose? *

25:39.238 --> 25:42.575
* That's not the secret
but I know what is *

25:42.609 --> 25:45.912
* Everybody dies
but not everyone lives *

25:45.945 --> 25:48.681
* Everybody dies
but not everyone lives *

25:48.715 --> 25:51.918
* I'm gonna run, run, run
Got the cops on my tail *

25:51.951 --> 25:54.921
* I'm gonna live my life
like I'm out on bail *

25:54.954 --> 25:58.224
* I'm gonna be up front
Gonna be the champ *

25:58.257 --> 26:00.559
* I'm gonna, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna *

26:00.593 --> 26:02.795
* I'm gonna cross that line

26:06.966 --> 26:09.636
* I'm gonna cross that line

26:14.006 --> 26:17.910
* I'm gonna run, run, run
I got the cops on my tail *

26:20.246 --> 26:24.050
* I'm gonna be out front
Gonna be the champ *

26:26.052 --> 26:28.220
* I'm gonna cross that line

26:28.254 --> 26:29.989
* Run, run, run
Got the cops on my tail *

26:30.022 --> 26:33.826
* I'm gonna live my life
like I'm out on bail *

26:33.860 --> 26:36.896
* Gonna be out front
Gonna be the champ *

26:36.929 --> 26:39.031
* I'm gonna, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna *

26:39.065 --> 26:43.102
* I'm gonna cross that line *

26:43.135 --> 26:46.906
[all sigh, moan]

26:55.848 --> 26:58.584
Hey, did you happen to stop by
the Spruce Juice yet?

26:58.617 --> 27:01.187
I, uh... no, I haven't.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.093
[clears throat] Nice snapshot
at the Spruce Juice.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.328
And by the way,
I totally understand

27:09.361 --> 27:11.798
why you couldn't put up any
of the ones you took of me.

27:11.831 --> 27:12.832
It's a family place.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.066
Who else saw it?

27:14.100 --> 27:17.203
Kaylie and Payson, although
she didn't seem too impressed.

27:17.236 --> 27:20.873
But that's just Payson. She
doesn't have any artistic sense.

27:26.345 --> 27:27.646
How are you feeling?

27:27.680 --> 27:31.851
Well, except for my
excruciating skin tears

27:31.884 --> 27:34.921
and throbbing muscles,
not bad.

27:34.954 --> 27:37.924
I know, my knee
is killing me.

27:37.957 --> 27:40.793
Can I talk to you,
please, alone?

27:40.827 --> 27:44.764
Whatever you have to say to me,
you can say it in front of
Payson.

27:50.903 --> 27:54.673
You were right. I have been
projecting my sister's illness
onto you

27:54.707 --> 27:58.845
and the truth is,
she's not as strong as you are.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.847
I'm sorry I got consumed
with trying to fix something

28:00.880 --> 28:02.815
that isn't mine to fix
in the first place.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.884
A big part of recovery
is having the support

28:04.917 --> 28:06.919
of those people
who care about you.

28:06.953 --> 28:09.355
And from now on,
you have mine.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.859
Tr... Truce?

28:13.960 --> 28:15.094
[chuckles]

28:16.929 --> 28:20.232
Not to ruin this moment,
but if you want to support her,

28:20.266 --> 28:21.734
we are hitting
the uneven bars tonight

28:21.768 --> 28:23.736
and could really use
some spotters.

28:23.770 --> 28:26.338
Payson and Lauren are helping me
get Sasha's compulsories down.

28:26.372 --> 28:29.742
I need Sasha to see
that I deserve my spot back.

28:29.776 --> 28:31.744
It's the only way
I'll make it to Worlds.

28:31.778 --> 28:34.947
I'm in. What time?

28:34.981 --> 28:37.750
Well, we gotta do it after the
place closes, so...

28:50.963 --> 28:52.765
I just heard that Kaylie
and the other Rock girls

28:52.799 --> 28:55.034
have been breaking into the gym
and training against your
guidance.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.136
I don't want to see
Kaylie get hurt.

28:57.169 --> 29:01.073
One wrong fall, in her
weakened condition,
and she could die.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.817
All right,
back handspring layout.

29:15.021 --> 29:18.757
Nice. Now, switch leap
and a punch front.

29:30.803 --> 29:32.438
All right, end with
a double full dismount.

29:38.878 --> 29:42.081
- Nice. Ready to hit floor?
- I need some water.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.857
Why did you lie?

29:51.290 --> 29:52.424
What?

29:52.458 --> 29:54.026
About the photo?

29:54.060 --> 29:56.795
If you hated it, that's one
thing, but why lie about it?

29:56.829 --> 29:58.797
I don't have time for this,
OK? I need to focus on Kaylie
right now,

29:58.831 --> 30:01.167
before Sasha makes
a horrible mistake.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.135
And what kind of mistake
would that be?

30:04.436 --> 30:06.805
Sasha, we can explain.

30:09.909 --> 30:10.910
I'm waiting.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.981
We're sorry that we went
behind your back,

30:15.014 --> 30:17.516
but that's Kaylie's spot,
and you at least have to
give her a chance.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.386
She's got all your compulsories
down, just let her show you.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.388
You've not only put
yourselves at risk,

30:22.421 --> 30:24.924
but you've blatantly
disrespected me.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.193
Give me one
reason why I shouldn't kick you
all off the team right now?

30:27.226 --> 30:29.461
Sasha, please.
It's not their fault.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.263
They were just
trying to help.

30:31.297 --> 30:34.233
I know I've made
bad decisions that
jeopardized your trust in me,

30:34.266 --> 30:37.436
but give me a chance
to show you who I am now

30:37.469 --> 30:39.838
and if you still
don't think I'm ready,

30:39.872 --> 30:42.942
then I promise,
I'll accept it.

30:42.975 --> 30:45.577
Do you think I am playing some
kind of game with you, Kaylie?

30:45.611 --> 30:48.247
- Do you think I like
keeping you off the team?
- No.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.149
Then you need to accept
that this decision

30:50.182 --> 30:51.817
is no longer in your grasp.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.486
All of you, get your stuff
and go home.

30:59.892 --> 31:01.961
Really? You can't be serious...

31:01.994 --> 31:04.230
It's only fair
you give her a chance.

31:04.263 --> 31:05.965
It is her spot.

31:12.972 --> 31:15.507
I will see one apparatus.
And one only.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.212
You've got this.

31:20.246 --> 31:23.149
Just trust yourself,
know who you are.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.484
[Lauren sighs]
This is your gym and your sport.

31:25.517 --> 31:26.652
Now, go own it.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.496
[man] Trust yourself, Kaylie.

32:38.324 --> 32:39.458
[both] Yes!

32:40.126 --> 32:41.193
[Payson] You see?

32:41.227 --> 32:42.995
You can't deny her now!

32:43.029 --> 32:44.963
That was one of the cleanest,
sharpest performances on bars

32:44.997 --> 32:47.099
- I have ever seen from you.
- Let me show you my vault
and beam.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.635
- No.
- But, why? What's the problem?

32:49.668 --> 32:52.704
The problem is that when I said
I didn't think you were ready
for Worlds,

32:52.738 --> 32:54.673
I didn't just mean physically.

32:54.706 --> 32:55.974
I also meant emotionally.

32:57.009 --> 32:58.577
I... I don't understand.

32:58.610 --> 33:01.047
I will not be responsible for
putting that level of pressure
on you.

33:01.080 --> 33:04.216
I'm concerned for your
recovery and your ability
to pace yourself,

33:04.250 --> 33:06.685
and as witnessed
by this little stunt,

33:06.718 --> 33:08.520
you're not there yet.

33:08.554 --> 33:09.721
My decision is final,

33:09.755 --> 33:11.657
you will
not be going to Worlds.

33:30.609 --> 33:33.379
I don't understand how Sasha
could take Kaylie's spot away.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.347
You should have seen her, Mom,
she was really great.

33:35.381 --> 33:38.250
Then I think you need to
remember that Sasha has
a plan for Kaylie,

33:38.284 --> 33:40.586
just like
he had a plan for you.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.591
What's really going on, Pay?

33:45.624 --> 33:49.661
To do what we do,
we need each other.

33:49.695 --> 33:52.698
And I tried so hard to get
Emily to believe in herself
and I lost her

33:52.731 --> 33:57.236
and now, I just... I feel like
I'm losing Kaylie too.

33:57.269 --> 34:00.606
Are you afraid you can't succeed
without your friends?

34:00.639 --> 34:03.642
Every risk I take, every time
I put myself out there,

34:03.675 --> 34:06.212
it's because I know
I have my team behind me.

34:06.245 --> 34:09.148
They're not just friends,
Mom, they're my sisters.

34:09.181 --> 34:11.617
And I feel like
Sasha's pulling us all apart.

34:14.253 --> 34:17.723
I promise, this will
find its way.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.660
Oh! So, in other news...

34:21.693 --> 34:23.795
I just happened to be at
the Spruce Juice earlier

34:23.829 --> 34:26.598
and I saw
a stunning photo of you.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.600
- [growls]
- [laughs] What's wrong?

34:28.634 --> 34:30.569
Can we please not have
this conversation?

34:30.602 --> 34:32.804
I just want to know
how it made you feel?

34:32.838 --> 34:37.409
I don't know, stupid
and embarrassed and...

34:37.443 --> 34:39.511
And, what?

34:39.545 --> 34:41.280
I don't know, kind of good,
I guess...

34:41.313 --> 34:42.714
[laughs] I knew it!

34:42.748 --> 34:44.516
Mom, I swear, if you don't
start beaming,

34:44.550 --> 34:46.685
I will never talk to you
about boys ever again.

34:46.718 --> 34:48.520
I'm stopping.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.422
I'm trying, it's just...

34:50.456 --> 34:53.559
You're always so serious
and focused,

34:53.592 --> 34:57.629
it's good to see you act like
a normal teenage girl for once.

34:57.663 --> 35:00.666
That's the problem, right there.
I'm not a normal teenage girl.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.734
And I am terrified because
of what happened to Emily.

35:02.768 --> 35:06.172
Liking a boy, having sex, that
means giving up on gymnastics

35:06.205 --> 35:09.475
and I won't do that,
I can't... I can't do that.

35:09.508 --> 35:14.513
Honey, you're allowed
to admire a boy who admires you

35:14.546 --> 35:17.449
without your whole world
falling apart.

35:17.483 --> 35:19.685
You're not Emily, Payson.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.297
[knocking]

35:31.330 --> 35:34.400
Oh, look at this dress,
isn't it gorgeous?

35:35.667 --> 35:37.369
[Summer] It's very beautiful.

35:37.403 --> 35:38.770
And very expensive.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.672
Oh, price is no object.
Daddy's paying.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.441
We can make an
appointment this weekend...

35:42.474 --> 35:44.610
Listen, Lauren,
we need to talk.

35:44.643 --> 35:48.680
OK... but me first.

35:50.249 --> 35:54.186
There's something I've been
thinking about for a while

35:54.220 --> 35:55.621
and, well...

35:56.788 --> 35:58.690
I want you to legally adopt me.

35:59.758 --> 36:00.726
What?

36:00.759 --> 36:01.727
Why should you be my stepmom

36:01.760 --> 36:03.495
when you can be my real mom?

36:03.529 --> 36:07.299
Since...
I don't have one anymore.

36:09.167 --> 36:13.705
Lauren, I'm so moved
that you would want that,

36:13.739 --> 36:15.707
I don't know what to say.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.343
Say, yes!

36:17.376 --> 36:20.312
Well, of course

36:20.346 --> 36:22.648
but I think we
should discuss it with your
father when he gets home.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.217
Oh, I know he'll say yes.

36:25.251 --> 36:27.619
This is so great!

36:27.653 --> 36:29.621
You're going
to be my mother.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.895
[man] Gymnastics
is an extreme sport.

36:36.928 --> 36:40.766
The adrenaline in taking risks
can be addictive to a gymnast.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.734
[sighs deeply] Which can lead to
poor judgment.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.703
And it's my job
to not let that happen.

36:44.736 --> 36:48.740
It's also your job to push them
to the edge of their limits.

36:48.774 --> 36:51.543
Nobody wins a gold medal erring
on the side of caution.

36:51.577 --> 36:52.811
And you think that's what
I'm doing with Kaylie,

36:52.844 --> 36:54.713
erring on the
side of caution?

36:54.746 --> 36:58.317
I think Kaylie is mentally
prepared to compete at Worlds.

36:58.350 --> 37:01.887
And if I thought doing so
would compromise her recovery
in any way

37:01.920 --> 37:03.589
I wouldn't have asked you
to come here today.

37:03.622 --> 37:06.692
I appreciate that you're her
therapist, but I'm her coach.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.528
And Kaylie became anorexic
on my watch.

37:09.561 --> 37:13.565
And Payson broke her back
and Emily got pregnant.

37:13.599 --> 37:16.768
And that all happened
because teenagers keep secrets

37:16.802 --> 37:19.971
from their parents
and their coaches.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.708
I'm not taking Kaylie
to Worlds.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.345
That's your call.

37:26.378 --> 37:28.780
But I would just ask you
to consider

37:28.814 --> 37:32.584
if you are protecting Kaylie
or punishing her

37:32.618 --> 37:35.921
because you feel like you failed
to do the impossible?

37:35.954 --> 37:36.955
The impossible?

37:36.988 --> 37:38.757
To read her mind.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.659
To predict the future.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.462
To catch her before she fell.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.735
Kaylie Cruz will be in recovery
for the rest of her life.

37:49.768 --> 37:53.605
But that doesn't mean
she can't strive for greatness.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.507
If you let her.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.378
Thank you.

38:02.047 --> 38:04.350
Now if you'll excuse me,
I came here for Kaylie,

38:04.383 --> 38:05.584
not to be analyzed.

38:10.456 --> 38:13.325
[Lauren] Sasha? In therapy?

38:13.359 --> 38:15.694
I wish I could have been
a fly on that wall.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.396
I don't think it went well.

38:17.429 --> 38:19.631
Gene didn't sound optimistic.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.367
Then we focus
on the next thing,

38:21.400 --> 38:23.301
- the Olympics.
- Come on, Payson,

38:23.335 --> 38:24.470
you know without going
to Worlds,

38:24.503 --> 38:27.406
I'm pretty much signing off
on the Olympics.

38:27.439 --> 38:28.674
Well, this year
it'll be different.

38:28.707 --> 38:31.743
Because we're not
going to London without you.

38:31.777 --> 38:35.313
It must be hard, seeing your
spot being snatched away

38:35.347 --> 38:36.682
but maybe it's
for the best, Kaylie.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.316
You never know when
you might snap again.

38:38.350 --> 38:41.887
It must be hard...
being such an obnoxious bitch.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.490
Oh, but you make it so easy.

38:44.523 --> 38:47.759
And in just a few moments,
when Sasha announces Tessa

38:47.793 --> 38:49.661
as Kaylie's replacement,

38:49.695 --> 38:52.364
my girls on the team
will outnumber yours,

38:52.398 --> 38:54.766
and I'll be the captain
of the US Team at Worlds.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.969
Who cares? You still
won't be able to play Sasha.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.771
I already have.

38:59.805 --> 39:03.542
Who do you think told him about
your secret training sessions?

39:03.575 --> 39:05.677
Can the National Team
members please come here.

39:13.552 --> 39:14.853
After observing
these past few days,

39:14.886 --> 39:16.555
I've come to a decision
about the girls

39:16.588 --> 39:17.956
I would like
to stay on with Worlds

39:17.989 --> 39:19.658
and vie for the open spot.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.461
Out with the old,
in with the new.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.931
- Tessa Grande.
- [squeals]

39:30.502 --> 39:34.573
And... Annie Dillon.

39:38.810 --> 39:42.814
- And Kaylie Cruz.
- [girls gasp, chatter]

39:42.848 --> 39:45.817
- You did it, Kaylie!
- [Kelly] What!?

39:45.851 --> 39:47.619
You said two girls were staying!

39:47.653 --> 39:51.423
Did I? Now it's three.

40:02.734 --> 40:06.472
Look, I'm sorry I lied
about seeing your photo
at the Spruce Juice.

40:06.505 --> 40:07.839
Because you didn't like it?

40:07.873 --> 40:10.809
No. Because I was embarrassed,
I guess.

40:10.842 --> 40:13.612
It's really beautiful,
I can't even believe...

40:14.513 --> 40:15.814
It's you?

40:17.082 --> 40:18.817
I know I'm pretty,
blah blah blah.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.819
I just...

40:20.852 --> 40:22.454
I don't know what you want.

40:24.856 --> 40:28.694
I want you to know it's you
I'm interested in, not Lauren.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.662
Max, I'm sorry, I just...

40:30.696 --> 40:31.930
It's OK if you don't like me.

40:31.963 --> 40:35.767
No, no, that's the problem, I...

40:35.801 --> 40:37.903
I do like you and I just...

40:37.936 --> 40:40.071
I can't risk
screwing up my gymnastics

40:40.105 --> 40:42.774
because I get all wrapped up
in someone else.

40:42.808 --> 40:45.744
I... I just can't do it.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.815
I understand.

40:51.717 --> 40:52.818
[sighs]

40:52.851 --> 40:54.753
It sounds to me what you need

40:54.786 --> 40:55.854
is a supportive friend,

40:55.887 --> 40:58.790
and I'm like the best friend
ever. Just ask Austin.

40:58.824 --> 41:02.661
I am the wind beneath
his big arrogant wings.

41:03.194 --> 41:05.997
Thanks. Friend.

41:06.031 --> 41:08.099
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- OK.

41:20.512 --> 41:21.580
What are you doing?

41:21.613 --> 41:24.215
What you should have done
a long time ago.

41:45.103 --> 41:48.173
I closed everything down,
except the one overhead light.

41:48.206 --> 41:50.776
Thank you. I'll take care of it
when I leave.

41:52.678 --> 41:55.581
And I'm sorry about Lauren
making a copy of my key,

41:55.614 --> 41:57.916
- that won't happen again.
- Worse things have happened.

41:59.818 --> 42:01.620
There's one more thing...

42:08.760 --> 42:12.497
Um, I guess I've been looking
for the right time to tell you,

42:12.530 --> 42:15.701
but I don't know that there
will ever be a right time, so...

42:17.769 --> 42:21.673
I'm engaged. To Steve.

42:21.707 --> 42:25.310
Um... Congratulations.

42:34.019 --> 42:35.721
[soft rock]

42:35.754 --> 42:39.725
* There's somebody, somewhere
It's sinking in *

42:39.758 --> 42:41.059
* Life'll never...

42:41.092 --> 42:43.729
[door closes]

42:43.762 --> 42:47.599
* An hour ago
there was nothing wrong *

42:47.633 --> 42:51.637
* Now someone's wondering how
they're gonna go home *

42:51.670 --> 42:55.707
* Maybe you're looking out
the window at a traffic light *

42:55.741 --> 42:59.678
* Wondering how you'll ever
make it through the first
night *

42:59.711 --> 43:00.912
* Wish I could reach you

43:00.946 --> 43:03.715
* From down the road
to let you know that *

43:03.749 --> 43:06.985
* We'll be OK

43:07.018 --> 43:10.989
* It won't feel this way

43:11.022 --> 43:13.659
* Someday

43:13.692 --> 43:15.694
[all] Surprise!

43:15.727 --> 43:17.963
[all laughing, chattering]

43:17.996 --> 43:22.634
* Wondering what to say
or how to be *

43:22.668 --> 43:26.071
* But I think that
it'll be OK *

43:27.138 --> 43:31.677
* Someday

43:35.080 --> 43:40.085
* Someday *
