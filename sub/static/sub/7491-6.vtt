00:03.625 --> 00:05.875
Does your hummus smell worse
than it normally does?

00:05.959 --> 00:07.291
It's not the hummus.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.667
It's coming from him.

00:08.750 --> 00:10.166
That's my new cologne.

00:10.250 --> 00:12.291
It's called "impurity."

00:12.583 --> 00:14.000
- Ah, hey!
- Whoa, dude!

00:16.750 --> 00:19.583
Check it out. Swathmore Academy students.

00:19.667 --> 00:22.166
Perfect skin, perfect hair, perfect teeth.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.834
Perfectly disgusting.

00:25.041 --> 00:26.709
They must have finally realized

00:26.792 --> 00:28.709
Phil makes the best falafel in town.

00:28.792 --> 00:30.333
Put it in a doggie bag, you.

00:30.417 --> 00:32.417
It's for our dogs.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.125
Can you imagine?

00:34.208 --> 00:35.917
He thought we were going to eat this.

00:38.583 --> 00:39.458
What's next?

00:39.542 --> 00:41.250
Should we go bathe in the mall fountain?

00:42.667 --> 00:44.208
Oh, uh, not-- not from 3:00 to 4:00.

00:44.291 --> 00:45.875
That's Jerry time.

00:47.709 --> 00:49.000
Hello, Jerry.

00:49.083 --> 00:52.375
I wish I could stay,
but my poor pug is starving.

00:53.500 --> 00:54.667
Woof.

00:56.125 --> 00:58.291
"My poor pug is starving."

00:58.417 --> 00:59.500
"Woof."

01:00.000 --> 01:01.208
Who talks like that?

01:01.291 --> 01:03.291
Unfortunately, no one I know.

01:04.583 --> 01:06.125
They think they're so much better than us

01:06.208 --> 01:08.041
just because they go to a private school.

01:08.125 --> 01:10.250
Well, we are eating their dog food.

01:11.959 --> 01:14.166
And they're a week away
from showing us up again

01:14.250 --> 01:15.750
during Seaford on parade.

01:16.125 --> 01:18.250
You know, I thought our float last year
was a winner.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.625
it was Ernie the janitor
sitting in a shopping cart

01:20.709 --> 01:21.875
with a tube sock on his head.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.208
Winner.

01:25.375 --> 01:27.542
I don't know why they always win
the float competition.

01:27.625 --> 01:28.959
I mean, what was so impressive

01:29.041 --> 01:30.959
about their giant space shuttle last year?

01:31.291 --> 01:32.542
It flew.

01:34.709 --> 01:38.458

02:17.750 --> 02:18.625
Guess what, guys?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
I was selected to be the head
of the float committee,

02:22.083 --> 02:23.542
because I am the only person

02:23.625 --> 02:26.417
who even has a chance of pulling it off.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.083
No one else wanted the job, did they?

02:29.166 --> 02:30.291
No, they did not.

02:31.500 --> 02:34.041
It's already Seaford on parade?

02:34.125 --> 02:35.542
I hate this time of year.

02:35.625 --> 02:36.959
What's wrong with Seaford on parade?

02:37.041 --> 02:38.458
This is the week

02:38.542 --> 02:40.166
where the whole town is reminded

02:40.250 --> 02:42.166
of the horrible thing I let happen.

02:43.208 --> 02:45.291
The year was 1996.

02:45.375 --> 02:47.625
- Oh, no.
- Yep. Here we go.

02:47.667 --> 02:51.125
I was proudly pushing
the Seaford float down the street.

02:51.208 --> 02:53.542
My theme? The mighty lentil.

02:53.625 --> 02:55.458
In honor of Seaford's number one crop.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.834
I love a good lentil story.

02:58.792 --> 03:01.291
Out of nowhere, ten-- nay!

03:01.417 --> 03:03.834
A hundred rich kids from Swathmore Academy

03:03.917 --> 03:06.125
attacked me, led by Teddy Kavanagh.

03:06.208 --> 03:07.583
<i>Oh, I fought back.</i>

03:07.667 --> 03:09.125
But when the dust settled,

03:09.208 --> 03:10.875
the Seaford High flag was gone,

03:10.959 --> 03:12.208
and my lentil had been...

03:13.500 --> 03:14.417
violated.

03:15.792 --> 03:19.000
Our flag has been held captive
by Swathmore ever since.

03:19.083 --> 03:21.291
Rudy, that happened a long time ago.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.417
You're an adult now.
Just go over there and get it back.

03:24.709 --> 03:25.750
Yeah.

03:26.166 --> 03:27.083
Maybe you're right.

03:27.667 --> 03:30.166
I am gonna march right over
to Swathmore Academy

03:30.250 --> 03:32.250
and get back
what Teddy Kavanagh took from me.

03:33.458 --> 03:35.291
Do you have any more good lentil stories?

03:35.750 --> 03:37.875
Hundreds. Here are my top five.

03:37.959 --> 03:39.750
Oh, no. Not again.

03:43.959 --> 03:46.375
Ladies, ladies. Me, me. Thank you.

03:46.959 --> 03:50.792
One of you lucky lasses
will be crowned the pearl of Seaford.

03:50.875 --> 03:53.667
During the parade,
you will ride in regal splendor

03:53.750 --> 03:56.250
in this big plastic clam.

03:56.709 --> 03:57.917
Ha-ha!

03:59.667 --> 04:00.542
That's right.

04:00.625 --> 04:03.834
This will be some special
lady's throne, hmm?

04:06.417 --> 04:08.041
This thing is soaking wet.

04:09.709 --> 04:10.834
Gross!

04:11.500 --> 04:12.667
Cat pee!

04:18.834 --> 04:20.083
Eww!

04:20.625 --> 04:23.291
Sweaty girl in her pajamas
just bumped into me.

04:24.041 --> 04:26.291
Sorry, I was distracted
by the giant toilet seat.

04:27.709 --> 04:30.709
That is the clam
for The Pearl of Seaford pageant.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.375
-
- Whatever.

04:33.417 --> 04:36.542
Too bad they don't have something
for you plain Seaford high girls.

04:37.709 --> 04:38.959
Excuse me?

04:39.041 --> 04:40.875
You're not beauty pageant material.

04:40.959 --> 04:42.458
You're what we call...

04:42.542 --> 04:44.291
Not beauty pageant material.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.417
Really? Well...

04:46.959 --> 04:48.959
maybe it's time for one of us
plain Seaford high girls

04:49.041 --> 04:49.917
to be the pearl.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.875
Oh. Never happening, hon.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.333
No Seaford High girl
will ever know the pleasures

04:54.375 --> 04:55.750
of sitting in that clam.

04:55.834 --> 04:57.625
- We'll see about that.
- Oh, yes, we will.

04:58.959 --> 05:00.375
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

05:00.458 --> 05:01.750
No. Oh! Oh, my!

05:01.834 --> 05:03.709
No, I don't believe it!

05:03.792 --> 05:06.875
That Seaford high girl
is getting all up in our clamshell!

05:07.750 --> 05:10.083
Yes, I could get used to this.

05:10.166 --> 05:12.834
I feel like a real princess.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.041
Why is this wet?

05:32.250 --> 05:34.041
Oh-- oh!

05:38.333 --> 05:39.375
Aah!

05:43.000 --> 05:44.208
Aah!

05:46.875 --> 05:48.208
- Oh, my g--
-

05:48.291 --> 05:49.625
Oh!

05:56.959 --> 05:59.542
Mighty polo mallets! What happened?

05:59.625 --> 06:00.959
There was all these kids,

06:01.041 --> 06:02.250
and they were just--

06:02.333 --> 06:03.583
Earthquake.

06:06.792 --> 06:07.709
Wait a minute.

06:08.583 --> 06:09.667
Teddy Kavanagh?

06:10.750 --> 06:12.291
You're the headmaster of Swathmore?

06:12.667 --> 06:14.625
Oh, I remember you.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.959
You were the little lentil boy.

06:17.041 --> 06:19.250
What was-- Rudy tootie fresh and fruity.

06:20.583 --> 06:21.834
I just go by Rudy now.

06:21.917 --> 06:23.041
Oh, I've heard you've done well.

06:23.125 --> 06:26.000
Teaching jazzercise
in a strip mall, isn't it?

06:27.083 --> 06:29.291
Uh, actually, I teach karate.

06:29.417 --> 06:30.959
I'm a third-degree black belt.

06:31.041 --> 06:33.250
And there's a flavor named after me
at the fro-yo den.

06:33.291 --> 06:34.959
Oh. What's it called?

06:35.041 --> 06:37.333
Rudy tootie fresh and fruity.

06:37.417 --> 06:38.625
Mm.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.875
Look, 16 years ago, you had your fun,

06:41.959 --> 06:43.875
and you took the Seaford High flag, and...

06:43.959 --> 06:46.625
And I'm here, because I want it back.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.500
I'm daffy for taffy.

07:13.625 --> 07:14.500
Rudy...

07:15.709 --> 07:17.083
you're never getting that flag.

07:17.500 --> 07:22.750
When I took it, Seaford High
officially became the home of the losers.

07:26.125 --> 07:27.041
Fine.

07:27.792 --> 07:28.625
I'll leave.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.166
But there is something you should know!

07:32.834 --> 07:34.583
I'm the one who pulled down your curtains,

07:34.667 --> 07:37.834
spilled your ink,
and broke your swingy ball thingy.

07:37.917 --> 07:38.750
Ha-ha!

07:41.959 --> 07:43.250
Uh, do you validate parking?

07:46.709 --> 07:48.834
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.041
Turn around.

07:52.417 --> 07:54.750
Oh, sweetie, wronger.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.125
What were you thinking
when you put on that abomination?

07:59.709 --> 08:01.834
My aunt loaned me this dress.

08:01.917 --> 08:04.834
Let me say this as delicately as I can...

08:05.500 --> 08:06.959
Your aunt does not love you.

08:09.375 --> 08:11.417
You know, the pageant's
a pretty big deal this year.

08:11.542 --> 08:13.333
The winner gets a crown
and gets to go to England

08:13.417 --> 08:14.625
to represent Seaford for a month.

08:14.709 --> 08:17.625
I don't care about crowns or England.

08:17.709 --> 08:20.417
I just want to wipe that smug smirk
off of Claire's face.

08:21.333 --> 08:24.542
Farm girl, you want to win,
this is what you do.

08:24.625 --> 08:26.792
Get yourself over to gown depot.

08:26.875 --> 08:28.875
Talk to Georgio, tell him I sent you,

08:28.959 --> 08:30.166
and that you need...

08:31.959 --> 08:33.667
The disaster package.

08:35.291 --> 08:36.750
Make it work, Kimberly.

08:38.166 --> 08:40.792
I don't need you or Georgio's help.

08:45.041 --> 08:46.166
Give me that.

08:49.375 --> 08:52.000
Jack, this float thing is killing me.

08:52.291 --> 08:53.458
I don't have a theme.

08:53.542 --> 08:55.792
I'm blocked. I'm freaking out, man!

08:55.875 --> 08:57.125
- I'm freaking out!
- Eddie.

08:57.208 --> 08:58.417
Eddie, man, just calm down.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.208
We'll help you come up with an idea.
Right, guys?

09:00.291 --> 09:02.208
Yeah, let's just do
a little free association.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.709
Uh, you know, spitball.

09:04.166 --> 09:06.083
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that may work.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.500
Uh, why don't you guys
just say the first word

09:08.583 --> 09:10.375
that pops into your head when I say...

09:11.083 --> 09:11.917
Seaford.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.542
- Seaford!
- No, no.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.125
It can't be Seaford.

09:15.542 --> 09:16.500
- Any word but--
- But.

09:16.583 --> 09:17.458
No, no.

09:17.542 --> 09:19.834
Dude, just say what pops into your--

09:19.917 --> 09:21.667
Pops! Keep 'em coming, man.
I'm in the zone.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.083
Forget it.

09:24.625 --> 09:25.750
Believe that?

09:25.834 --> 09:27.125
Try and help a guy.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.417
Kavanagh wouldn't even validate
my parking...

09:29.500 --> 09:30.959
- Rudy!
- Hey.

09:31.041 --> 09:32.333
How'd it go over at Swathmore?

09:32.667 --> 09:34.542
Actually, it's a-- It's a funny story.

09:34.625 --> 09:36.417
I, uh, I went down there, and...

09:36.500 --> 09:38.041
This is totally going to make you laugh.

09:38.125 --> 09:41.834
Um, the kid who took the flag
is now the headmaster.

09:41.917 --> 09:43.458
It's funny, huh?

09:44.750 --> 09:45.959
It's funny!

09:46.041 --> 09:48.333
So you asked for the flag back
and he said no?

09:48.375 --> 09:49.667
Yeah. Not only that.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.125
But he said when he took the flag,

09:51.208 --> 09:54.458
Seaford High officially became
the home of the losers.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.792
You know what? That's it.

09:58.208 --> 09:59.750
If they won't give us our flag back,

09:59.834 --> 10:01.041
we're gonna take it.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.083
Then you know what you guys could do?

10:03.166 --> 10:05.542
You could climb up
on that General Swathmore statue

10:05.625 --> 10:07.875
in front of the library,
and put a big bra on it.

10:07.959 --> 10:10.500
And one of those adulty diapers
on the horse.

10:10.583 --> 10:12.208
Wouldn't that be so...

10:12.291 --> 10:14.291
Wouldn't that-- Diaper in the--

10:14.375 --> 10:15.959
Or you guys could just go
get the flag back.

10:21.250 --> 10:22.542
You know this would be a lot easier

10:22.625 --> 10:24.542
if we had Eddie and Kim here
to help us find the flag.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.208
Nah, Kim's building a float for the parade

10:26.291 --> 10:28.083
and Eddie's
in The Pearl of Seaford pageant.

10:28.875 --> 10:30.417
No, wait. Swap 'em.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.375
Now we just have to blend in.

10:34.625 --> 10:37.625
Put these caramel Jolly whoppers
in your mouth and bite down.

10:37.709 --> 10:40.458
They'll make our teeth stick together
and we'll sound just like 'em.

10:41.083 --> 10:43.917
- How do you-- what?
- How is biting down on some candy

10:44.000 --> 10:45.792
gonna make us sound-- Oh. Oh.

10:46.291 --> 10:48.291
Oh, it totally works.

10:48.375 --> 10:49.959
Milton, you're a genius.

10:51.709 --> 10:53.709
And I said, "Pull over, daddums,

10:53.792 --> 10:57.709
I will not be caught dead
in a white Ferrari after memorial day."

11:00.166 --> 11:01.333
Seriously, huh?

11:01.542 --> 11:02.875
What it do, girl?

11:05.125 --> 11:06.917
Hey, let's split up and find our flag.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.709
Just don't draw any attention
to yourselves.

11:08.792 --> 11:09.709
- Let's go.
- Okay, cool.

11:24.125 --> 11:25.417
Jerry, is that you?

11:26.750 --> 11:28.542
Huh? Uh, no.

11:29.208 --> 11:31.000
No, I'm, uh...

11:32.166 --> 11:33.333
Forrest.

11:34.375 --> 11:35.625
Locker.

11:36.583 --> 11:38.208
Forrest Locker the 28th.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.083
I know it's you, Jerry.

11:41.750 --> 11:43.583
And I know why you're here.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.291
You've come to take something
that belongs to you.

11:47.375 --> 11:48.417
You're right.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.750
What will you do with it once it's yours?

11:50.834 --> 11:53.083
I don't know. Probably shove it
in my pants and run out of here.

11:54.375 --> 11:57.291
Oh! Jerry, this is my boyfriend Monty.

11:57.375 --> 11:58.458
Monty...

11:59.125 --> 12:00.375
I'm leaving you for Jerry.

12:00.458 --> 12:01.417
Wait, what?

12:01.750 --> 12:03.583
I'm not Jerry. I'm, uh-- I'm Forrest.

12:03.792 --> 12:05.375
I've never met Claire,
I've never seen Claire,

12:05.458 --> 12:06.959
and I don't know Claire. Tell him, Claire.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.750
Run, Forrest! Run!

12:19.041 --> 12:21.583
Now, where would that flag be?

12:22.166 --> 12:23.083
Mm.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.625
Ooh!

12:26.709 --> 12:28.291
I've always wanted to try this.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.458
Mm, mm!

12:31.875 --> 12:33.792
Here we go. Ah!

12:34.208 --> 12:36.125
Whoo!

12:40.834 --> 12:42.041
Well, well, well.

12:42.125 --> 12:43.375
<i>There you are, Mumford.</i>

12:43.458 --> 12:44.667
Ready for our rematch?

12:47.208 --> 12:48.291
En garde!

12:59.333 --> 13:00.375
Ha!

13:04.625 --> 13:05.917
-
- Ohh!

13:11.333 --> 13:12.333
Gah!

13:12.583 --> 13:14.041
You're not Mumford!

13:14.125 --> 13:15.834
You're that skinny geek from Seaford high!

13:16.542 --> 13:17.500
Get him!

13:17.583 --> 13:19.583
Aah!

13:23.375 --> 13:25.250
Flag's gotta be around here somewhere.

13:25.792 --> 13:26.834
Oh!

13:28.959 --> 13:30.667
This guy is daffy for taffy.

13:40.291 --> 13:43.125
As you know, this Saturday
is our yearly humiliation

13:43.208 --> 13:45.291
of Seaford High during the parade.

13:45.375 --> 13:47.500
And that Rudy tootie fellow
gave me a great idea.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
This year, we're going
to take it up a notch,

13:50.083 --> 13:53.625
by flying their flag
from our pirate ship float!

13:54.542 --> 13:56.750
Does anyone else notice
my grizzly inching forward?

14:04.750 --> 14:05.917
Oh!

14:06.000 --> 14:07.458
Thank you.

14:07.792 --> 14:08.792
I am out.

14:09.250 --> 14:12.458
That bear ate me during
a camping trip two years ago.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Whoo!

14:14.083 --> 14:15.291
This is a fake bear.

14:15.709 --> 14:17.000
Well, then my excuse makes no sense,

14:17.083 --> 14:18.917
which means I should probably
just-- just go.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.166
Get him!

14:27.125 --> 14:28.959
- Whoa!
-

14:33.583 --> 14:36.625
Beautiful, Mary Beth. Just beautiful.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.250
Okay.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.125
Up next is Kim Crawford,

14:40.208 --> 14:42.291
doing an interpretive dance.

14:42.417 --> 14:43.291
I can't wait.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.583
Oh, I'm sorry. Okay.

15:09.166 --> 15:11.000
Now let's kick it.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.792
-
- This is my jam!

15:28.792 --> 15:30.792
They're gonna fly our flag on their float?

15:31.250 --> 15:33.250
That taffy-tugging tyrant!

15:34.166 --> 15:36.041
Guys, I've been thinking about this.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.750
I think I've got a solution.

15:38.458 --> 15:39.542
Yeah, me too.

15:39.625 --> 15:41.000
Really? What have you got?

15:41.834 --> 15:44.208
Uh, no. No. I don't know.
I thought you were gonna go first,

15:44.291 --> 15:46.208
and I was just gonna say,
"That's what I was thinking."

15:48.041 --> 15:51.041
All the floats start in that hangar
by the train station.

15:51.625 --> 15:54.625
What if we got our flag back
before the parade starts?

15:54.709 --> 15:56.792
Yep, that's what I was thinking. Mm-hmm.

15:56.875 --> 15:58.959
How are we going to get near their float?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.250
All the Swathmore kids
know what we look like.

16:01.333 --> 16:03.000
Uh, they'll be guarding that flag.

16:04.291 --> 16:06.583
Guys, I finished our float.

16:06.667 --> 16:07.917
- Great!
- Awesome.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.125
What is it?

16:09.458 --> 16:12.250
It's a replica of the screaming log
of Seaford.

16:13.291 --> 16:17.458
Oh, legend has it that the founder
of our town crawled into a hollow log

16:17.542 --> 16:19.417
to survive the harsh winter of 1808.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.625
Why do they call it the "screaming log"?

16:22.000 --> 16:25.417
Unfortunately, a family of wolverines
had the same idea.

16:28.375 --> 16:29.458
Guys...

16:30.250 --> 16:32.750
I think I know how
we're gonna get our flag back.

16:34.458 --> 16:36.083
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

16:36.166 --> 16:38.417
All right, Claire. Here's your question.

16:38.500 --> 16:42.125
Why do you think you
should be the pearl of Seaford?

16:43.834 --> 16:46.709
I'm rich, I'm pretty, and...

16:48.041 --> 16:49.458
World peace!

16:49.542 --> 16:50.667
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

16:50.750 --> 16:51.875
What?

16:53.208 --> 16:54.959
No, thank you, Claire.

16:55.041 --> 16:56.875
I think we're all better people...

16:56.959 --> 16:58.875
having heard that, huh, aren't we?

16:58.959 --> 17:01.166
Yeah...

17:01.250 --> 17:03.083
Okay, Kimberly. Your turn.

17:03.166 --> 17:05.709
Seriously? A 26.

17:06.291 --> 17:09.125
Well, let me tell you,
if this is what you think is good,

17:09.208 --> 17:11.333
then I'm obviously not your pearl.

17:11.917 --> 17:14.000
Did I mention I take in homeless whales?

17:14.083 --> 17:15.542
- Stuff it, Claire!
-

17:16.750 --> 17:18.875
You know, let me tell you,
if I was the pearl,

17:18.959 --> 17:21.625
I wouldn't just represent
the rich and the pretty people.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.917
I'd represent everyone.

17:24.375 --> 17:26.333
From the hardworking women
in the factories...

17:26.834 --> 17:29.041
to the guy at the doughnut shop
that eats all the napkins.

17:29.750 --> 17:31.000
Well, maybe not him.

17:31.792 --> 17:32.959
Well, you know what?

17:33.709 --> 17:34.792
Even him.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.000
Because that's who we are in Seaford.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.291
A bunch of crazy, napkin-eating nuts.

17:52.041 --> 17:53.875
You are a pearl, Kim.

17:53.959 --> 17:55.875
An undeniable pearl.

17:55.959 --> 17:57.083
-
- Oh!

18:01.125 --> 18:04.417
Okay, people.
We're rolling out in five minutes.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.125
Use the bathrooms now.

18:06.208 --> 18:08.959
We all remember what happened
to that man last year

18:09.041 --> 18:10.083
in the swan costume.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.375
Uh, hey, Eddie.

18:15.625 --> 18:16.500
What is that thing?

18:16.583 --> 18:18.291
Screaming log of Seaford.

18:18.375 --> 18:20.375
Um, don't you think
you're gonna look a little silly

18:20.458 --> 18:21.959
pushing that thing down main street?

18:22.041 --> 18:25.959
Kim, you do know you're sitting
in a clam, don't you?

18:28.375 --> 18:29.500
Well played.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.583
What is that thing?

18:34.667 --> 18:36.667
Some kind of a sea turd?

18:38.834 --> 18:40.000
Your float's a joke.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.583
<i>Ha-ha! Joke's on you!</i>

18:43.792 --> 18:45.834
<i>Ha-ha! Joke's on you!</i>

18:45.875 --> 18:48.291
-
- <i>Eddie, open the stupid latch!</i>

18:48.375 --> 18:49.875
Oh, my bad.

18:52.125 --> 18:54.917
Ha-ha! Ha-ha!

18:55.000 --> 18:56.208
The joke's on you!

18:56.291 --> 18:58.000
We've come to get our flag back!

18:58.667 --> 19:00.458
Oh, oh, foot's asleep.

19:02.166 --> 19:03.000
Let's go.

19:04.083 --> 19:05.291
They're taking the ship!

19:09.375 --> 19:10.458
Oh!

19:16.583 --> 19:18.542
You're just a Seaford high loser.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.792
And so are your friends.

19:19.875 --> 19:20.917
En garde!

19:21.250 --> 19:23.583
-
- Whoa!

19:26.417 --> 19:27.625
Two minutes.

19:27.709 --> 19:29.041
Two minutes, please.

19:34.458 --> 19:35.375
Jack!

19:43.750 --> 19:44.625
Great.

19:44.709 --> 19:46.458
Whoa!

19:48.834 --> 19:51.917
Oh, you get back in your clam
right now, young lady.

19:54.583 --> 19:55.667
- Whoa!
-

20:29.959 --> 20:32.083
I got it, I got it, I got it!

20:32.166 --> 20:33.166
Whoa!

20:33.834 --> 20:34.875
Really?

20:36.583 --> 20:37.875
Thanks for your help.

20:37.959 --> 20:39.417
I heard you won the pageant.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.875
You're looking
at the new Pearl of Seaford.

20:41.959 --> 20:43.709
Uh... this is yours.

20:46.208 --> 20:49.542
So, uh, is the pearl too good
to take a ride with her friends on a log?

20:49.625 --> 20:51.792
No way! Let's do this.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.000
Kimberly, it's go time.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.917
Let's get back in your clam, girl.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.125
-
- Uh-oh.

20:59.250 --> 21:02.208
Guys, I think I might be
really, really hurt.

21:02.291 --> 21:04.709
I'm driving that clam
over to the hospital.

21:11.083 --> 21:12.208
<i>You think this is okay?</i>

21:12.291 --> 21:13.875
Us taking their ship?

21:14.125 --> 21:16.000
They abandoned it. We might as well.

21:16.750 --> 21:19.625
I feel so bad for Eddie.
He worked so hard on his log.

21:19.709 --> 21:21.333
I'm driving a pirate ship!

21:24.041 --> 21:26.166
