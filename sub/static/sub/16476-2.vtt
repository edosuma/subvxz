00:00.968 --> 00:04.027
BULL: <i>I'm Dr. Jason Bull.
I'm not a lawyer.</i>

00:04.030 --> 00:07.731
<i>I'm an expert in what's
called trial science.</i>

00:07.733 --> 00:11.268
<i>I study the jury's behavioral patterns.</i>

00:11.270 --> 00:14.038
<i>I know what they're
thinking before they do.</i>

00:15.241 --> 00:18.042
<i>Everything my team learns
gets plugged into a matrix,</i>

00:18.044 --> 00:21.545
<i>which allows us to
assemble a shadow jury</i>

00:21.547 --> 00:24.748
<i>that is scary in its
predictive efficiency.</i>

00:26.986 --> 00:29.486
<i>The verdict you get depends on me.</i>

00:29.488 --> 00:32.240
<i>And that's no bull.</i>

00:36.629 --> 00:39.096
Don't tell me plane
crashes are bad luck.

00:39.098 --> 00:41.465
You think that Malaysia
flight just disappeared?

00:41.467 --> 00:44.969
Statistically, flying is
still the safest way to travel.

00:44.971 --> 00:46.337
It's a business, isn't it?

00:46.339 --> 00:47.838
They need to be held accountable.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.107
You have to trust the pilot, but...

00:50.109 --> 00:51.608
it's a leap of faith.

00:51.610 --> 00:53.410
You get on a plane without
a second thought.

00:53.412 --> 00:55.512
But you have no idea who's flying it.

00:55.514 --> 00:58.949
(thunder rumbling)

00:58.951 --> 01:00.818
(plane rattling)

01:00.820 --> 01:02.386
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Ladies and gentlemen,

01:02.388 --> 01:04.700
we'll be starting our
descent into Albany

01:04.702 --> 01:05.756
- in just a few moments.
- (crying)

01:05.758 --> 01:07.816
Flight attendants will
be coming through the cabin

01:07.817 --> 01:09.526
to pick up any last-minute trash items.

01:09.528 --> 01:11.428
As a reminder, we're
entering some rough air,

01:11.430 --> 01:14.698
so please remain in your
seats with seatbelts fastened.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.333
(plane continues rattling)

01:19.372 --> 01:20.304
- Ma'am.
- (sniffles)

01:20.306 --> 01:22.239
You really need to take your seat.

01:22.241 --> 01:24.808
I'm so sorry.

01:32.685 --> 01:34.485
This needs to be up, sweetie.

01:34.487 --> 01:37.221
(rumbling grows louder,
passengers gasping)

01:38.691 --> 01:40.891
(passengers screaming)

01:42.161 --> 01:45.729
BENNY: <i>It's a simple
question, Mr. Stowman.</i>

01:45.731 --> 01:47.364
VINCE: In the world history of

01:47.366 --> 01:49.767
stupid questions, that
is the stupidest question.

01:49.769 --> 01:51.935
MARISSA: Our client just torpedoed

01:51.937 --> 01:53.237
jurors two and eight.

01:53.239 --> 01:55.506
12 thinks he's a rebel.

01:55.508 --> 01:56.774
Lifelong fan, but I...

01:56.776 --> 01:58.509
- VINCE: Wanker.
- MARISSA: There goes 12.

01:58.511 --> 02:00.711
VINCE: No further questions.

02:02.148 --> 02:04.597
This is after three
days of witness prep.

02:04.718 --> 02:07.484
We've seen worse. Maybe once.

02:08.108 --> 02:10.054
This is getting very tiresome, Dr. Bull.

02:10.056 --> 02:11.121
Hey, hey.

02:11.123 --> 02:13.223
I totally get it. You had a monster hit,

02:13.225 --> 02:15.192
and some one-hit wonder
comes out of the woodwork

02:15.194 --> 02:17.161
and says you stole the hook to <i>his</i> song?

02:17.163 --> 02:19.029
- It's <i>your</i> song.
- That's right.

02:19.031 --> 02:20.764
And it hurts, Dr. Bull.

02:20.766 --> 02:21.832
It hurts.

02:21.834 --> 02:23.167
I know it hurts.

02:23.169 --> 02:25.335
And that's why we're gonna prove

02:25.337 --> 02:28.038
that it took you ten
years to write this song.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.073
And that it comes...

02:29.075 --> 02:30.541
(hits chest) from your soul.

02:30.543 --> 02:32.743
(quietly): I know it's about

02:32.745 --> 02:34.912
the collapse of your first marriage.

02:34.914 --> 02:36.747
And I'm sorry.

02:36.749 --> 02:39.783
But you see these people?

02:39.785 --> 02:41.048
They're the jury.

02:41.190 --> 02:43.253
They're normal, everyday folks
who come home one day,

02:43.255 --> 02:45.489
open their mail, and
they have a jury summons.

02:45.491 --> 02:47.491
They're like my fans?

02:47.493 --> 02:49.059
That's exactly what they are.

02:49.061 --> 02:50.627
They're the same people who throw

02:50.629 --> 02:52.429
panties on stage and cheer for you.

02:52.431 --> 02:54.064
And you got to see them like that.

02:54.066 --> 02:55.732
You got to talk to them like that.

02:55.734 --> 02:56.834
MARISSA: Bull?

02:56.836 --> 02:58.669
Rock on.

02:58.671 --> 03:00.304
- Go get 'em.
- MARISSA: Bull.

03:00.306 --> 03:02.406
All right. Sir Vincent
needs a fresh jury.

03:02.408 --> 03:04.159
- Thank you guys very much.
- Bull.

03:06.015 --> 03:10.080
NEWS ANCHOR: In the storm,
Essence Airlines Flight 1372

03:10.082 --> 03:13.117
went down approximately three
miles from Albany Airport.

03:13.119 --> 03:15.352
As you can see from
the wreckage behind me,

03:15.472 --> 03:19.356
all 62 passengers are presumed dead.

03:19.358 --> 03:21.458
The president of
Essence Airlines is on the line.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.660
Call back.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.762
(newscast continues)

03:25.764 --> 03:28.668
Hamilton-Sena and the
usual airline litigation firms

03:28.669 --> 03:30.000
are calling to sign us up.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.302
Crash is less than an
hour old, and the vultures

03:32.304 --> 03:34.104
- are already circling, huh?
- BULL: Missing the runway

03:34.106 --> 03:36.173
does seem to inspire lawsuits.

03:36.175 --> 03:37.674
Sorry, I'm still the new guy, but...

03:37.676 --> 03:39.276
you handled aviation suits before?

03:39.278 --> 03:40.878
Every crash in the last ten years.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.112
And, uh, Bull's a pilot.

03:42.114 --> 03:43.747
Maybe it's <i>because</i> I'm a pilot.

03:43.749 --> 03:46.049
Just spoke with a
former colleague from the FBI.

03:46.051 --> 03:47.651
- Was it...?
- Wasn't terrorism.

03:47.653 --> 03:49.853
Tried to land in a storm
with wind shear.

03:49.855 --> 03:53.023
NEWS ANCHOR: A shocking new
development, a miracle perhaps.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.225
The nose cone of the plane

03:55.227 --> 03:58.729
was severed from the
fuselage upon impact.

03:58.731 --> 04:00.998
Sources tell us that one of the pilots

04:01.000 --> 04:03.567
was pulled from the cockpit alive.

04:03.569 --> 04:06.136
Never heard of a
pilot surviving a crash.

04:06.138 --> 04:08.505
On a crash like this.

04:08.507 --> 04:12.709
Before we sign any
client... Victim or airline...

04:12.711 --> 04:14.511
We're gonna talk to this pilot.

04:14.513 --> 04:16.713
(sighs)

04:19.118 --> 04:21.185
MAN: Essence Airlines and
supporting industries

04:21.187 --> 04:24.721
have all been named in a separate
wrongful death filing.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.657
The pilot is also being sued.

04:26.659 --> 04:29.326
(reporters clamoring)

04:29.328 --> 04:33.030
There are security concerns,
because of death threats.

04:33.032 --> 04:35.432
What's the pilot's status?

04:35.434 --> 04:37.498
Thank you. That's all for today.

04:42.841 --> 04:46.009
If you needed any
convincing lawyers are overpaid,

04:46.011 --> 04:49.134
the firm owns 18 floors of
prime New York real estate.

04:49.281 --> 04:51.213
Best behavior, Dr. Bull.

04:53.307 --> 04:54.751
It's a pleasure to meet you,

04:54.753 --> 04:55.852
- Capt...
- Captain Mathison.

04:55.854 --> 04:57.621
I'm glad you fully recovered.

04:58.991 --> 05:00.224
Dr. Bull, thank you.

05:00.814 --> 05:02.926
I can't say the last four
months have been easy,

05:02.928 --> 05:04.228
but I'm here.

05:04.230 --> 05:05.229
Oscar Weber.

05:05.231 --> 05:06.496
- I'm her attorney.
- (chuckles): Oh!

05:06.498 --> 05:08.799
Gosh, yeah. I've heard so
much about you, Oscar.

05:08.801 --> 05:12.035
Thanks for taking an
interest in this case, Dr. Bull.

05:12.037 --> 05:14.805
Not sure there's a
need here for what you do.

05:14.807 --> 05:17.074
Getting the truth?

05:17.076 --> 05:17.890
Winning?

05:17.892 --> 05:19.876
We may not even take this case to trial.

05:19.878 --> 05:21.878
Captain Mathison here has been charged

05:21.880 --> 05:23.013
with gross negligence.

05:23.015 --> 05:24.681
If she were to lose in court,

05:24.683 --> 05:26.350
she may be facing criminal charges.

05:26.352 --> 05:28.151
TAYLOR: Dr. Bull, how did you know

05:28.153 --> 05:30.254
I was Captain Mathison and not him?

05:30.256 --> 05:32.122
Well, you don't bounce when you walk.

05:32.124 --> 05:33.824
So clearly you're former military,

05:33.826 --> 05:35.525
and you're wearing aviator sunglasses,

05:35.527 --> 05:37.694
so I figured... pilot.

05:37.696 --> 05:41.665
Plus, one look at Oscar, and...
there's no way <i>he's</i> a pilot.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.507
All right, let's go
hear this flight recording.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.403
TAYLOR (over computer):
Passing outer marker,

05:46.405 --> 05:47.504
ILS Approach 1-6, good to land.

05:47.506 --> 05:50.232
MAN: Radar contact, cleared to
land runway 1-6. Ceiling 2-0-0.

05:50.234 --> 05:52.535
Visibility one-quarter
mile, wind one-niner-zero,

05:52.537 --> 05:54.136
- variable 25 gust...
- Tower Albany to Flight 213...

05:54.138 --> 05:55.171
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Wind
shear. Wind shear.

05:55.173 --> 05:56.305
COPILOT: Wind shear, loss 20 knots.

05:56.307 --> 05:57.840
- TAYLOR: Cross-control 0500.
- (urgent chatter)

05:57.842 --> 05:59.441
- Can't... What are you doing?
- TAYLOR: Throttle's up!

05:59.443 --> 06:00.843
On the go... got to take it around!

06:00.845 --> 06:02.211
- Full power, full power...
- That's not protocol.

06:02.213 --> 06:03.612
TAYLOR: Clean it up, full power!

06:03.614 --> 06:05.614
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Terrain...
Pull up. Terrain... pull up.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.449
TAYLOR: Five more seconds! Brace! Brace!

06:07.451 --> 06:08.651
(sustained beep)

06:08.653 --> 06:11.020
MAN: Tower Albany, I've
lost them off-screen.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.488
You need a minute?

06:12.490 --> 06:14.790
I'm okay.

06:14.792 --> 06:17.593
Sounds like you did the best you
could in a hell of a storm.

06:17.595 --> 06:19.595
I considered flying on
to Boston early on,

06:19.597 --> 06:22.832
but the storm was worse there, so...

06:22.834 --> 06:25.100
We started our descent, and... (sighs)

06:25.102 --> 06:27.203
we hit a massive wind shear.

06:27.205 --> 06:29.638
WEBER: The challenge is
gonna be the NTSB report.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.141
It says...

06:32.143 --> 06:35.477
Captain Mathison failed to
follow emergency protocol

06:35.479 --> 06:38.247
and lost control of the plane.

06:38.249 --> 06:39.481
MARISSA: The NTSB says

06:39.483 --> 06:42.051
80% of crashes are
caused by pilot error.

06:42.053 --> 06:43.752
BULL: It's not exactly a fair fight

06:43.754 --> 06:46.655
when the pilots usually
aren't around to defend themselves.

06:46.657 --> 06:49.024
WEBER: The flight
recorder backs up the report.

06:49.026 --> 06:51.791
A jury is going to be
inclined to believe it.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.362
Unless someone bothers to give them

06:53.364 --> 06:55.464
a credible alternative explanation.

06:55.466 --> 06:57.566
Her own copilot questioned her decision.

06:57.568 --> 06:59.568
And you can read the mind of a dead man?

06:59.570 --> 07:01.036
Good for you, Oscar.

07:01.038 --> 07:03.906
Do you think you lost control?

07:03.908 --> 07:05.674
I don't remember.

07:05.676 --> 07:08.644
I wish I could tell you why
I did what I did that day,

07:08.646 --> 07:11.080
but it just...

07:11.082 --> 07:13.249
WEBER: To my point,

07:13.251 --> 07:15.651
the plaintiffs are gonna
find that very convenient.

07:15.653 --> 07:17.386
She had six broken ribs.

07:17.388 --> 07:19.021
And a severe concussion.

07:19.023 --> 07:22.157
Memory loss does
happen with head trauma.

07:23.539 --> 07:24.672
You were in the military?

07:24.674 --> 07:27.408
I flew 139 sorties over Iraq.

07:27.410 --> 07:29.476
Got over 12,000 flight hours.

07:29.478 --> 07:31.345
So what's the last
thing you do remember?

07:31.347 --> 07:33.080
The wind shear alarm.

07:33.082 --> 07:35.249
Then I woke up in the hospital.

07:36.986 --> 07:39.587
They told me everyone on the flight...

07:41.691 --> 07:45.025
And there were no survivors.

07:45.027 --> 07:46.493
And you feel responsible.

07:46.495 --> 07:49.763
My plane went down and I lost 62 souls.

07:49.765 --> 07:51.465
Of course I feel responsible.

07:51.467 --> 07:53.467
I <i>am</i> responsible.

07:53.469 --> 07:57.071
WEBER: Taylor, no one wants to see you

07:57.073 --> 08:01.175
endure a long, difficult trial.

08:01.177 --> 08:04.745
Let <i>me</i> work with the airlines.

08:04.747 --> 08:07.881
We can hash out a
settlement for these families.

08:07.883 --> 08:09.250
Lord knows

08:09.252 --> 08:11.385
what a jury is going to come back with.

08:11.387 --> 08:12.453
We'll know.

08:12.455 --> 08:14.349
Excuse me?

08:14.487 --> 08:16.490
We'll know what a
jury's gonna come back with.

08:16.492 --> 08:18.025
We'll know because that's what we do.

08:18.027 --> 08:21.595
That's what trial science is.

08:21.597 --> 08:24.632
And something to remember, Mr. Weber.

08:25.701 --> 08:28.869
Just because Taylor feels responsible

08:28.871 --> 08:30.804
doesn't mean she's to blame.

08:33.476 --> 08:36.309
Captain Mathison, I'd
like to take your case.

08:38.114 --> 08:40.514
Huh. Okay, s-so what do we do next?

08:40.515 --> 08:43.350
My team and I go to work.

08:45.955 --> 08:48.222
I didn't sleep for a week
after that plane went down.

08:48.224 --> 08:50.212
I was lead mechanic
on the gate that day.

08:50.259 --> 08:51.959
Couldn't help but
wonder if I'd missed something.

08:51.961 --> 08:53.027
How you sleeping now?

08:53.029 --> 08:54.595
Eight hours a night.

08:54.597 --> 08:56.664
Look, I did all my preflight checks.

08:56.666 --> 08:59.700
The NTSB was all up in here and
they still cleared my crew.

08:59.702 --> 09:01.969
The plane wasn't ten years old.

09:01.971 --> 09:03.804
There was barely a
grease spot on the repair log.

09:03.806 --> 09:04.805
So it was okay to fly.

09:04.807 --> 09:05.939
Waxed and ready to go.

09:05.941 --> 09:07.708
Well, that report said that the pilots

09:07.710 --> 09:09.243
did their own inspection before takeoff.

09:09.245 --> 09:11.645
- Why is that?
- They're required to do a walk-around.

09:11.647 --> 09:13.947
But it wasn't both of them
that day, it was just the copilot.

09:13.949 --> 09:15.783
Is that standard procedure?

09:15.785 --> 09:16.950
It's always the copilot.

09:16.952 --> 09:18.819
She did her walk-around
like she was supposed to.

09:18.821 --> 09:20.487
What do you... what do you mean "she"?

09:20.489 --> 09:22.256
There are lady copilots.

09:22.258 --> 09:24.658
Well, the lady wasn't the
copilot on that flight.

09:24.660 --> 09:25.793
She was the captain.

09:25.795 --> 09:27.494
I mean...

09:27.496 --> 09:28.829
Damn.

09:31.934 --> 09:33.567
JUDGE: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

09:33.569 --> 09:36.470
have you reached a verdict?

09:36.472 --> 09:38.205
Guilty of gross negligence.

09:38.207 --> 09:39.173
Verdict.

09:39.175 --> 09:41.416
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

09:41.669 --> 09:43.477
MARISSA: We've
questioned all of our mock jurors,

09:43.479 --> 09:45.145
and they've all found Captain
Mathison guilty.

09:45.147 --> 09:46.780
Let me work on her image.

09:46.782 --> 09:48.482
Maybe we're sending the wrong message.

09:48.484 --> 09:50.617
I have some ideas that
could balance her military edge.

09:50.619 --> 09:53.520
Worth a shot. We varied our emphasis
on her military record,

09:53.522 --> 09:55.756
her stellar pilot rating, nothing's
changed the outcome.

09:55.758 --> 09:58.025
JUDGE: Mr. Foreman, have
you reached a verdict?

09:58.027 --> 09:59.326
FOREMAN: We have, Your Honor.

09:59.328 --> 10:01.795
In the case of Berman
et al. v. Mathison,

10:01.797 --> 10:05.532
we find the defendant not guilty.

10:05.534 --> 10:07.368
Not guilty? That's amazing.

10:07.370 --> 10:08.836
How'd he do that?

10:08.838 --> 10:10.671
It is amazing.

10:10.673 --> 10:12.005
All we had to do was

10:12.007 --> 10:14.641
adjust one basic assumption
about the case.

10:14.643 --> 10:16.610
- Which one?
- Meet our client,

10:16.612 --> 10:19.546
Captain Taylor Mathison.

10:19.548 --> 10:21.515
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

10:21.517 --> 10:24.585
all this case needed was a man's touch.

10:24.587 --> 10:25.986
(clicks tongue)

10:25.988 --> 10:28.255
Sorry. I'm just the messenger.

10:28.257 --> 10:30.195
Not the misogynist.

10:36.639 --> 10:38.348
BENNY: <i>So, juries are finding her guilty</i>

10:38.350 --> 10:40.350
- because she's a woman.
- MARISSA: But the data shows

10:40.352 --> 10:41.718
that when it comes to female pilots,

10:41.720 --> 10:43.119
there is a clear gender bias.

10:43.121 --> 10:45.221
Yeah, but it's not 1977.

10:45.223 --> 10:46.856
There are women in power everywhere.

10:46.858 --> 10:47.924
Well, it's subconscious.

10:47.926 --> 10:49.092
Things people aren't even aware of,

10:49.094 --> 10:50.593
like getting the door for a woman.

10:50.595 --> 10:52.028
BULL: Benny's always been chivalrous.

10:52.030 --> 10:53.296
CABLE: I don't get it.

10:53.298 --> 10:54.864
Is it really difficult to open a door?

10:54.866 --> 10:56.566
It's back to where
women wore farthingales.

10:56.568 --> 10:58.134
(chuckles): Farthingales.

10:58.136 --> 10:59.435
What's a farthingale?

10:59.437 --> 11:01.704
It's basically like wearing
an upside-down umbrella.

11:01.706 --> 11:03.606
All right, my point is we have to

11:03.608 --> 11:05.742
dial gender bias into Taylor's defense.

11:05.744 --> 11:08.378
- Which is?
- Which is...

11:09.648 --> 11:11.981
...an unavoidable wall of wind

11:11.983 --> 11:14.183
tragically brought down Flight 1372,

11:14.185 --> 11:17.453
and not even the skills of a
great pilot could save them.

11:17.455 --> 11:19.656
Okay. All right, I'm
gonna play devil's advocate.

11:19.658 --> 11:22.325
How do we prove she
didn't lose control of the plane

11:22.327 --> 11:23.993
if she can't even remember
what happened?

11:23.995 --> 11:25.862
Start with the flight recorder.

11:25.864 --> 11:27.363
Yeah, about that.

11:27.365 --> 11:29.899
You're aware that it only
covers the last 30 minutes

11:29.901 --> 11:31.067
before the crash?

11:31.069 --> 11:32.235
CHUNK: My phone holds

11:32.237 --> 11:34.103
1,000 hours of music, but a black box

11:34.105 --> 11:36.272
taps out halfway
through a Wayne Newton album?

11:36.274 --> 11:38.408
I tap out halfway through
a Wayne Newton album.

11:38.410 --> 11:41.377
Black box is only a piece of the puzzle.

11:41.379 --> 11:43.613
Okay, Danny, I want a play-by-play

11:43.615 --> 11:45.114
in the 24 hours of Taylor's life

11:45.116 --> 11:45.982
before the crash.

11:45.984 --> 11:47.283
And, Cable,

11:47.285 --> 11:48.985
focus on the flight itself.

11:48.987 --> 11:50.053
Fill in the blanks.

11:50.055 --> 11:51.287
Danke schoen.

11:51.289 --> 11:52.622
That's a Wayne Newton reference

11:52.624 --> 11:54.524
for your benefit, Chunk.

11:57.095 --> 11:59.395
(sighs)

12:03.234 --> 12:04.667
BULL: Cute kids.

12:04.669 --> 12:07.837
I take it you and
your copilot were close.

12:07.839 --> 12:10.173
Yeah.

12:10.175 --> 12:12.375
Ken and I were best friends.

12:12.377 --> 12:14.577
Mary and the kids are like family to me.

12:14.579 --> 12:16.612
They miss their father.

12:16.614 --> 12:18.181
It's hard for them to understand

12:18.183 --> 12:20.049
why I came home and he didn't.

12:20.051 --> 12:22.285
And Mary's mad at me.

12:22.287 --> 12:23.786
Been sitting here over an hour,

12:23.788 --> 12:25.534
and she's barely said a word.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.746
I don't know, sometimes I think she...

12:28.748 --> 12:30.848
blames me for Ken's death.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.551
Or maybe I'm just a reminder

12:33.553 --> 12:35.686
of what happened.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.258
You know, those families,
they act like I don't care

12:40.260 --> 12:42.293
about the victims, but...

12:42.295 --> 12:45.029
I think about those people every day.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.764
The void they left.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.133
The futures they don't get to have.

12:49.135 --> 12:52.437
I just keep asking myself: did I panic?

12:52.439 --> 12:55.039
You know, did I, did
I, did I take a maneuver

12:55.041 --> 12:57.075
that was too risky?

12:57.077 --> 12:59.577
Taylor, something tells me you didn't.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:09.956 --> 13:13.057
Women drivers.

13:13.059 --> 13:15.159
We've all heard the expression.

13:15.161 --> 13:17.829
Maybe even said it in
the heat of the moment,

13:17.831 --> 13:22.133
even though female drivers have
a higher safety record than men.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.501
Care to watch the mock trial?

13:23.503 --> 13:24.502
No, thanks.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.537
I'm, uh, looking for my client.

13:28.274 --> 13:30.074
You know, he really should be talking

13:30.076 --> 13:31.709
about her record as an Air Force pilot.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.878
He will, but first we
need to call out the bias.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.947
Once people are made aware,
they tend to compensate.

13:35.949 --> 13:39.078
You did one mock trial and
determined that the whole world

13:39.079 --> 13:40.602
has it in for female pilots?

13:40.777 --> 13:42.253
We did five.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.921
And it's not a conspiracy.

13:43.923 --> 13:46.491
Implicit bias literally
means you don't know it's there.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.493
So, you strike all the male jurors?

13:48.495 --> 13:49.494
No, because women

13:49.496 --> 13:51.729
display as much gender bias as men do.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.498
Hmm.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.334
Can you scare me up a cup of coffee?

13:56.336 --> 13:57.959
No, it's fine.

13:58.196 --> 14:00.338
I was just about to grab myself a cup.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.073
Okay, great.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.242
Look, I know Dr. Bull has

14:04.244 --> 14:09.480
three PhDs in psychology,
but he's not an attorney.

14:09.482 --> 14:12.116
And there are so many
unknowns to overcome at trial.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.484
We're just getting started.

14:13.486 --> 14:16.154
By the end of this process, we
will know which types of jurors

14:16.156 --> 14:18.090
we want and which to exclude.

14:19.804 --> 14:23.506
All I know is, if Taylor is smart,

14:23.508 --> 14:25.708
she will settle with the plaintiffs

14:25.710 --> 14:28.678
and make this whole thing go away.

14:28.680 --> 14:33.082
BENNY: Is a decorated Air
Force fighter pilot,

14:33.084 --> 14:35.551
who flew 139 sorties over Iraq.

14:35.553 --> 14:36.652
Where's the douche?

14:36.654 --> 14:39.121
Looking for Taylor.

14:40.124 --> 14:41.924
Did you spit in this?

14:41.926 --> 14:42.992
No.

14:42.994 --> 14:44.961
But don't drink it.

14:46.164 --> 14:47.396
CHUNK: You're in the spotlight

14:47.398 --> 14:49.165
the minute you walk into the courtroom.

14:49.167 --> 14:52.335
Dr. Bull says I need to
look strong, but not aggressive,

14:52.337 --> 14:53.769
confident, but not arrogant.

14:53.771 --> 14:56.105
Well, blue conveys confidence.

14:56.107 --> 14:58.608
And navy adds a sense of remorse.

14:58.610 --> 15:00.510
- I like your style.
- Thanks.

15:00.512 --> 15:02.011
How did you end up here?

15:02.013 --> 15:03.779
I arrived via Vogue magazine.

15:03.781 --> 15:05.715
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

15:05.717 --> 15:07.550
Weren't you a defensive
back for Georgia?

15:07.552 --> 15:09.585
Well, I was that,
too, before I was this.

15:09.587 --> 15:10.518
I knew it.

15:10.519 --> 15:11.988
You almost won the Heisman.

15:11.990 --> 15:13.356
Weren't you gonna go pro?

15:13.358 --> 15:15.691
Draft didn't work out too well for me.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.583
- Why isn't she in her uniform?
- Oh, we can do that,

15:18.585 --> 15:20.618
if you want to make this look
like a military tribunal.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.654
In court, we want her to
look like a human being,

15:23.656 --> 15:25.089
not a pilot.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.758
Mr. Weber, I heard you
were in the office.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.428
Taylor, I know Dr.
Bull has convinced you

15:30.430 --> 15:33.264
that he has some sort of magic formula

15:33.266 --> 15:37.501
that will make a jury see
past the facts and exonerate you.

15:37.503 --> 15:38.469
Chunk,

15:38.471 --> 15:39.937
would you give us a second?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.005
And, uh,

15:41.007 --> 15:43.808
- tell Benny I need to see him.
- Mm-hmm.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.911
WEBER: While Dr. Bull has
been searching for biases,

15:46.913 --> 15:49.046
I've been in touch with the airline,

15:49.048 --> 15:50.681
who are negotiating a settlement

15:50.683 --> 15:51.849
with the plaintiffs.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.684
- A settlement?
- Yes.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.052
It's a very generous offer

15:55.054 --> 15:57.321
to the victims' family, as it should be,

15:57.323 --> 16:00.691
and it protects you from
any financial liability.

16:00.693 --> 16:01.859
What do you need from me?

16:01.861 --> 16:02.927
I need you to agree

16:02.929 --> 16:05.196
to the findings of the NTSB report.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.197
BULL: The report that

16:06.199 --> 16:07.431
finds her at fault.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.700
A-And if I do that, I'll be reinstated?

16:09.702 --> 16:11.202
Well...

16:11.204 --> 16:13.638
BULL: No. Fired.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.674
And unemployable and
never able to fly again.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.676
She killed 62 people.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.578
No, Oscar.

16:20.580 --> 16:24.215
An airplane crash killed 62
people, not your client.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.150
Marissa mentioned you
were pushing for a settlement.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.184
That struck her,

16:27.186 --> 16:28.252
because even though she's a woman,

16:28.254 --> 16:29.587
she's quite good with numbers.

16:29.589 --> 16:33.557
So, she had Cable, also a
woman, also good with computers,

16:33.559 --> 16:34.558
do some digging.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.960
It seems that your contract

16:35.962 --> 16:39.697
with Taylor stipulates the
less the airline pays the families,

16:39.699 --> 16:41.432
the more your firm makes.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.934
That seems like a conflict of interest,

16:43.936 --> 16:46.337
but then again, you have all
that office space to pay for.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.806
That's why I hate lawyers.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.354
That's my... bias.

16:51.355 --> 16:53.344
So you have a financial incentive
for me to settle?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.880
It's called a reverse contingency fee.

16:55.882 --> 16:58.015
It's how the airline controls damages.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.551
That, and by blaming you.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.754
Taylor.

17:05.191 --> 17:08.392
This is in <i>your</i> best interest.

17:08.394 --> 17:11.127
Do not let him twist this.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.564
Can I fire my attorney?

17:13.566 --> 17:14.929
Of course you can.

17:15.085 --> 17:16.334
Especially since he was supplied to you

17:16.336 --> 17:18.035
by the airline.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.071
You're relieved, Mr. Weber.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.540
See how easy that was?

17:22.541 --> 17:25.742
Dr. Bull, you're a piece of work.

17:27.646 --> 17:30.781
I like those glasses.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.983
Dr. Bull, I can't
afford my own attorney.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.618
It's all right.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.088
We have someone. The best, really.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.558
Hey.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.526
What's up with Weber? Looked pissed.

17:42.528 --> 17:46.630
Captain Mathison, meet your new lawyer.

17:54.465 --> 17:56.798
Is this normal? For you to
sub in for a real trial?

17:56.800 --> 17:59.234
It's been about a year since
I've been inside a real courtroom.

17:59.236 --> 18:00.635
What kind of law did you practice?

18:00.637 --> 18:02.537
I was a prosecutor in the D.A.'s office.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.506
Yale Law, Supreme Court clerkship.

18:04.508 --> 18:05.774
He was a pit bull.

18:05.776 --> 18:07.108
If I were on trial,

18:07.110 --> 18:09.511
Benny's the only lawyer I'd want.

18:09.513 --> 18:10.745
Why did you leave?

18:10.747 --> 18:12.213
I got fired.

18:14.952 --> 18:17.519
Wait till you hear why.

18:20.157 --> 18:21.056
(gavel bangs)

18:21.057 --> 18:23.291
All right, prospective
jurors have been sworn in.

18:23.293 --> 18:24.326
Mr. Dworkin,

18:24.328 --> 18:25.927
you may begin your voir dire.

18:25.929 --> 18:27.295
Thank you, Your Honor.

18:28.332 --> 18:31.066
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

18:31.068 --> 18:33.501
I'm going to ask all of you some
questions to see if you can

18:33.503 --> 18:37.105
honestly and fairly assess this case.

18:37.107 --> 18:38.540
This trial is a suit over...

18:38.542 --> 18:42.477
TAYLOR (quietly): How do you know
who has this bias against female pilots?

18:42.479 --> 18:43.907
We ask them.

18:44.861 --> 18:47.882
MARISSA (over earpiece):
Okay, we have six strikes left.

18:47.884 --> 18:49.651
Who's up first?

18:49.653 --> 18:52.087
The lovely Martha Plemmons.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.055
Martha Plemmons, 58.

18:54.057 --> 18:56.992
High school librarian.

18:56.994 --> 18:58.927
Crossword enthusiast.

18:58.929 --> 19:01.029
(quietly): The key is not to let

19:01.031 --> 19:02.564
anyone know what we're screening for,

19:02.566 --> 19:04.383
so our questions have
to be a little off.

19:04.384 --> 19:05.929
BENNY: Ms. Plemmons...

19:06.825 --> 19:09.359
what would someone say they
didn't like about you?

19:09.361 --> 19:11.695
Your Honor, this isn't a job interview.

19:11.697 --> 19:13.029
What's the defense going for here?

19:13.031 --> 19:15.565
It's his nickel, Mr. Dworkin.

19:15.567 --> 19:16.866
(whispers): Please.

19:16.868 --> 19:19.536
I-I guess I can be a
little pushy sometimes.

19:19.538 --> 19:20.670
(laughs)

19:20.672 --> 19:23.573
I accessed the district's HR department.

19:23.575 --> 19:24.841
Martha's filed two complaints

19:24.843 --> 19:26.976
for equal pay against
a male counterpart.

19:26.978 --> 19:29.365
I think she nailed "a little pushy."

19:29.366 --> 19:31.045
MARISSA: Yeah, and self-aware.
That means she'd be open

19:31.046 --> 19:32.728
to assess her own hidden bias on gender.

19:32.729 --> 19:35.218
BULL: Two complaints for equal pay
sounds pretty aware of gender bias.

19:35.220 --> 19:37.087
She only has 47 friends.

19:37.089 --> 19:39.556
I don't think she's gonna win
Miss Congeniality on this jury.

19:39.558 --> 19:40.924
BULL: We don't need her to.

19:40.926 --> 19:42.625
She'll have an
opinion and stick with it.

19:42.627 --> 19:44.761
The question is: will
her opinion help or hurt us?

19:44.763 --> 19:46.730
CABLE: I'd say help.
Her last book purchase

19:46.732 --> 19:48.531
was Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In.

19:48.533 --> 19:50.333
- She gave it five stars.
- That is key.

19:50.335 --> 19:52.702
If we can establish a
gender bias against Taylor,

19:52.704 --> 19:54.471
Martha is gonna
resent the airline big-time.

19:54.473 --> 19:56.315
BULL: Yeah, I've been watching her.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.608
Every time she looks at
Taylor, she has admiration.

19:58.610 --> 20:00.410
She'll be on our side.

20:03.382 --> 20:05.782
Good for the defense, Your Honor.

20:05.784 --> 20:09.185
Okay, let's do an
online search together.

20:09.187 --> 20:11.588
"Three black teenagers."

20:14.693 --> 20:16.893
But if I change "black" to "white..."

20:19.998 --> 20:22.652
Your Honor, what is this? Race-baiting?

20:25.604 --> 20:27.771
Anybody surprised by this?

20:27.773 --> 20:29.906
That's just some PC nonsense.

20:29.908 --> 20:31.541
CABLE: This guy would
win troll of the year

20:31.543 --> 20:32.842
for the things he posts online.

20:32.844 --> 20:35.545
MARISSA: Mr. Varni is not what
I would call enlightened.

20:35.547 --> 20:37.914
He's not gonna
recognize gender bias if it was

20:37.916 --> 20:40.083
full frontal in front of him.

20:40.085 --> 20:42.685
I say bounce.

20:43.755 --> 20:45.989
Strike, Your Honor.

20:47.826 --> 20:50.193
All right, let's
talk about Dave Lemanski.

20:50.195 --> 20:51.895
MARISSA: Professional storm chaser.

20:51.897 --> 20:53.229
Should be respectful

20:53.231 --> 20:55.265
of the power of Mother Nature, but...

20:55.267 --> 20:56.733
also a self-described expert.

20:56.735 --> 20:59.335
Well, at least he'll understand
the effects of wind shear.

20:59.337 --> 21:02.093
Yeah, uh, he may not be
afraid of a Tennessee twister,

21:02.094 --> 21:04.407
but he seems to run from
the opposite sex.

21:04.409 --> 21:07.076
Surprise, storm
chasing's a total sausage fest.

21:07.078 --> 21:09.045
BULL: I'm looking at his body language.

21:09.047 --> 21:10.346
He's not a happy camper.

21:10.348 --> 21:12.015
He's antsy just
sitting through voir dire.

21:12.017 --> 21:14.884
Okay, the data on Lemanski is mixed.

21:14.886 --> 21:16.419
On the plus side,

21:16.421 --> 21:19.289
he will pay attention to
weather conditions during the crash,

21:19.291 --> 21:20.590
but it's unclear

21:20.592 --> 21:23.059
that he'll recognize his gender bias.

21:23.061 --> 21:24.461
Who do we have if we bounce him?

21:24.463 --> 21:25.528
CABLE: We get...

21:25.530 --> 21:26.996
"Rod the Bod,"

21:26.998 --> 21:29.666
trainer-slash-model-slash-vitamin
salesman.

21:29.668 --> 21:32.335
MARISSA: Uh, Rod's
social media is loaded

21:32.337 --> 21:35.805
with narcissistic self-congratulatory
dude speak.

21:35.807 --> 21:38.208
I saw him checking out a
young lady in the gallery.

21:38.210 --> 21:39.709
The guy's here to find a date.

21:39.711 --> 21:41.144
Total lack of awareness.

21:41.146 --> 21:43.012
He's gonna be a huge problem for us.

21:43.014 --> 21:44.714
Okay.

21:44.716 --> 21:47.484
Into the storm we go.

21:47.486 --> 21:49.431
We've got ourselves a jury.

21:49.563 --> 21:50.820
MARISSA: Seven women, five men.

21:50.822 --> 21:53.423
BENNY: Good for the defense, Your Honor.

21:55.293 --> 21:56.459
I'm a high school librarian.

21:56.461 --> 21:57.894
I'm a high school librarian.

21:57.896 --> 21:59.429
I'm a single mom and teach fifth grade.

21:59.431 --> 22:01.130
I'm a single mom and
I teach fifth grade.

22:01.132 --> 22:02.832
My favorite hobbies are
Sudoku and model trains.

22:02.834 --> 22:05.702
My favorite hobbies are
Sudoku and model trains.

22:05.704 --> 22:09.105
For every juror, we hire what
we call a "mirror juror."

22:09.107 --> 22:11.040
How can they be exactly the same?

22:11.042 --> 22:13.476
Well, Marissa's created an algorithm

22:13.478 --> 22:16.145
that can track a person across
404 different variants.

22:16.147 --> 22:19.449
We put them in the
courtroom for the entire trial.

22:19.451 --> 22:22.118
MARISSA: They wear biometric
watches that allow us to track

22:22.120 --> 22:24.320
their emotional responses
to events in the courtroom.

22:24.322 --> 22:27.223
And with an astonishing
degree of accuracy,

22:27.225 --> 22:29.659
they respond just like the actual jury.

22:29.661 --> 22:32.529
Here we have a dermatologist,
a Spanish teacher,

22:32.531 --> 22:33.730
and a Web designer.

22:33.732 --> 22:35.899
We've identified them as open-minded.

22:35.901 --> 22:38.034
Lemanski is impulsive,

22:38.036 --> 22:40.837
a self-described expert...
Could go either way.

22:40.839 --> 22:43.673
But these four are followers.
They'll go with the wind.

22:43.675 --> 22:45.508
And what about those two?

22:45.510 --> 22:47.877
That's Frederick West, infantry soldier.

22:47.879 --> 22:50.813
All about personal responsibility.

22:50.815 --> 22:52.982
But if he senses you're
making excuses, we'll lose him.

22:52.984 --> 22:55.084
Orville Maynard, on the other hand...

22:55.086 --> 22:56.920
retired English professor.

22:56.922 --> 22:58.187
Didactic.

22:58.189 --> 23:00.590
Despite a history of celebrated
liberal causes,

23:00.592 --> 23:02.792
his personal syllabus reads
like a tribute to dead white men.

23:02.794 --> 23:05.728
And he's spent his
career lecturing, not listening.

23:05.730 --> 23:07.764
(sighs) So what do we do?

23:07.766 --> 23:11.434
We learn their habits, lexicon,
everything about them.

23:11.436 --> 23:13.002
And then we connect with them,

23:13.004 --> 23:15.572
with the help of our mirror jurors.

23:15.574 --> 23:17.540
One juror at a time.

23:21.413 --> 23:25.348
DWORKIN: It is tragic that the
lone survivor of this crash

23:25.350 --> 23:28.117
is the only one here to speak of it.

23:28.119 --> 23:29.719
It's even more tragic

23:29.721 --> 23:31.888
that she has no memory of what she did.

23:31.890 --> 23:34.003
Of losing control of a plane,

23:34.124 --> 23:37.226
before smashing it to the
ground killing all 62 passengers.

23:37.228 --> 23:38.561
MARISSA: We're getting good feedback

23:38.563 --> 23:40.547
from the biometric watches.

23:40.677 --> 23:43.099
So far, our mirror juror for
number 11 is responding

23:43.101 --> 23:45.001
most favorably to opposing counsel,

23:45.003 --> 23:47.604
particularly when they
mention the number of victims.

23:47.606 --> 23:49.238
BENNY: Captain Taylor Mathison

23:49.240 --> 23:53.576
is a decorated Air Force fighter pilot

23:53.578 --> 23:57.513
who flew 139 sorties over Iraq.

23:57.515 --> 24:00.049
BULL: Juliette Lee scratched
her neck after she looked at Taylor.

24:00.051 --> 24:01.584
Something's making her uncomfortable.

24:01.586 --> 24:02.919
How's her mirror looking?

24:02.921 --> 24:05.989
She is clearly liking Taylor's
military service.

24:05.991 --> 24:08.458
Looks like our best in with Juliette

24:08.460 --> 24:12.061
is to keep focusing on
Taylor's experience as a fighter pilot.

24:12.063 --> 24:15.798
So when Flight 1372
was hit by wind shear

24:15.800 --> 24:18.301
that slammed the plane

24:18.303 --> 24:21.571
toward the ground at
200 feet per second,

24:21.573 --> 24:23.706
not even a pilot of her caliber

24:23.708 --> 24:25.808
could save them.

24:25.810 --> 24:29.646
When a pilot encounters wind
shear, one advances the power,

24:29.648 --> 24:32.048
retracts the speedbrakes
and retracts the gear

24:32.050 --> 24:35.485
to reduce drag, build
speed and maintain altitude.

24:35.487 --> 24:37.820
And, uh, speaking as
an NTSB investigator

24:37.822 --> 24:41.357
with 20 years
experience, did the defendant

24:41.359 --> 24:42.959
follow protocol?

24:42.961 --> 24:45.461
REYNOLDS: No. In fact,

24:45.463 --> 24:47.196
even her copilot seemed baffled...

24:47.198 --> 24:48.798
Objection. Conjecture.

24:48.800 --> 24:52.112
Mr. Reynolds can testify in
his opinion as an expert.

24:52.113 --> 24:54.070
REYNOLDS: We feel that
had she followed protocol...

24:54.072 --> 24:56.039
Control?

24:56.041 --> 24:58.174
There is no control in wind that strong.

24:58.176 --> 24:59.475
DWORKIN: ...18.

24:59.477 --> 25:02.812
Please, sir, if you
would, walk us through.

25:02.814 --> 25:05.348
The plane was erratic,

25:05.350 --> 25:08.618
off course, not holding it's heading,

25:08.620 --> 25:10.553
weaving back and forth.

25:10.555 --> 25:12.689
It's clear she panicked,

25:12.691 --> 25:15.825
lost control.

25:15.827 --> 25:17.760
DWORKIN: Thank you.

25:17.762 --> 25:19.562
Nothing further, Your Honor.

25:21.433 --> 25:23.066
I don't think this guy's a real pilot.

25:23.068 --> 25:24.333
He's a paper pusher.

25:24.335 --> 25:27.403
I could be getting be high with
one of my grad students.

25:27.405 --> 25:29.439
BENNY: Mr. Reynolds,

25:29.441 --> 25:30.640
prior to the crash,

25:30.642 --> 25:32.208
what was Captain
Mathison's flight record?

25:32.210 --> 25:33.409
She had a flawless record.

25:33.411 --> 25:35.111
BENNY: And yet, your report found

25:35.113 --> 25:37.046
pilot error to be the
cause of the crash.

25:37.048 --> 25:38.114
Correct.

25:38.116 --> 25:39.215
Hmm.

25:39.217 --> 25:41.017
What about...

25:41.019 --> 25:43.019
other crashes involving female pilots?

25:43.021 --> 25:45.088
This is the first to my knowledge.

25:45.090 --> 25:48.157
Wow. Really?

25:48.159 --> 25:49.759
Women must be really good pilots.

25:49.761 --> 25:50.927
Actually, there aren't very many.

25:50.929 --> 25:53.262
Well, what percentage
of pilots are female?

25:53.264 --> 25:55.264
About four percent.

25:55.266 --> 25:56.499
Four out of 100.

25:56.501 --> 25:57.734
Now, that is surprising.

25:57.736 --> 26:00.069
It's a challenging lifestyle.

26:00.071 --> 26:02.271
Don't flight
attendants work similar shifts?

26:02.273 --> 26:03.806
DWORKIN: Objection.

26:03.808 --> 26:05.274
- Relevance.
- Withdrawn.

26:05.276 --> 26:07.343
Nothing further, Your Honor.

26:07.345 --> 26:10.847
Taylor may be a great
pilot, but she's also woman.

26:10.849 --> 26:13.082
And beautiful. She's trouble.

26:20.458 --> 26:22.158
Tell me more about juror number four,

26:22.160 --> 26:23.326
Ms. Juliette Lee.

26:23.328 --> 26:25.495
Uh, three kids.

26:25.497 --> 26:28.231
Works from home designing Web pages.

26:28.233 --> 26:30.199
Creative, tech savvy.

26:30.201 --> 26:32.935
And all the data shows that she
should be on Taylor's side.

26:32.937 --> 26:34.704
Divorced?

26:34.706 --> 26:35.671
Three years ago.

26:35.673 --> 26:38.141
Her husband left her for his secretary.

26:39.878 --> 26:42.378
Find out what color
hair the secretary had.

26:44.315 --> 26:47.583
Let's bring the copilot's
wife into mock court.

26:49.020 --> 26:52.722
I need to get her on
the stand and play lawyer.

26:54.993 --> 26:56.926
BULL: Your husband Ken was the copilot.

26:56.928 --> 26:58.661
Were you with him
before the flight took off?

26:58.663 --> 27:01.130
We had been together just
a few hours before he left.

27:01.132 --> 27:02.265
Where?

27:02.267 --> 27:04.967
We had an appointment together.

27:04.969 --> 27:06.669
An appointment?

27:08.473 --> 27:09.806
Marriage therapy?

27:09.808 --> 27:12.642
I loved my husband, but
he wasn't perfect.

27:12.644 --> 27:16.412
He'd, uh... slipped before.

27:16.414 --> 27:17.480
"Slipped"?

27:17.482 --> 27:19.115
As in, had an affair?

27:20.418 --> 27:22.118
Pilots are away a lot.

27:22.120 --> 27:24.554
It's hard.

27:26.524 --> 27:28.191
We were trying to move past it.

27:28.193 --> 27:31.060
Hmm.

27:31.062 --> 27:33.896
You ever think about who
the other woman was?

27:33.898 --> 27:35.531
Of course I think about it.

27:36.968 --> 27:38.568
Ken was sleeping with Taylor.

27:38.570 --> 27:39.702
TAYLOR: What? Mary!

27:39.704 --> 27:40.803
MARY: You were my friend.

27:40.805 --> 27:42.894
- How could you?
- Ken? I would never!

27:42.895 --> 27:44.907
My God, stop lying! What's
wrong with you?!

27:44.909 --> 27:45.908
- He's dead!
- She's lost her mind.

27:45.910 --> 27:47.376
Why didn't you die, too?!

27:47.378 --> 27:49.078
- Whoa. Okay, okay.
- You should've died

27:49.080 --> 27:50.713
- instead of him!
- Shh, shh, it's okay.

27:50.715 --> 27:52.615
Okay, let's take a little
break, all right?

27:52.617 --> 27:55.184
It's okay. Marissa's gonna take you.

27:55.186 --> 27:57.153
- (door opens)
- BULL: Taylor, stop.

27:57.155 --> 27:58.855
You think I was sleeping with Ken?

27:58.857 --> 28:00.289
That's what that stunt was about?

28:00.291 --> 28:01.691
Not me.

28:01.693 --> 28:04.994
Juror number four, Juliette Lee.

28:04.996 --> 28:09.131
Her husband left her for a
woman who looks a lot like you.

28:09.133 --> 28:11.400
(sighs) I can't believe this.

28:11.402 --> 28:13.336
Of course I wasn't sleeping with him.

28:13.338 --> 28:15.404
Well, he was sleeping with someone.

28:15.406 --> 28:17.846
Look, if you're not gonna leave,
can you at least turn around?

28:19.544 --> 28:22.044
You said Ken was upset.

28:22.046 --> 28:23.880
He missed his inspection,
you covered for him,

28:23.882 --> 28:26.749
and you're still protecting
him, and I want to know why.

28:26.751 --> 28:27.917
Dr. Bull, I...

28:27.919 --> 28:29.452
I can come back.

28:29.454 --> 28:30.887
No, I was just leaving.

28:33.424 --> 28:35.024
Listen to me.

28:35.026 --> 28:37.393
Marissa is talking to Mary right now.

28:37.395 --> 28:41.364
I had her testify in mock
court so that she would blow here

28:41.366 --> 28:42.765
and not in the real trial,

28:42.767 --> 28:45.601
because if Mary accused
you of sleeping with Ken

28:45.603 --> 28:48.771
in the actual court, true or not,

28:48.773 --> 28:50.773
the plaintiffs would
argue that you were distracted

28:50.775 --> 28:51.908
by a lovers' quarrel

28:51.910 --> 28:54.277
in the cockpit and that
is why the plane crashed.

28:54.279 --> 28:58.714
Now, I will get this
jury on your side...

28:58.716 --> 29:02.618
but not unless you're honest with me.

29:02.620 --> 29:04.186
You want honesty?

29:04.188 --> 29:05.688
We're done.

29:05.690 --> 29:07.757
(sighs): Oh.

29:09.494 --> 29:10.893
(quietly): Women.

29:16.089 --> 29:19.626
♪ ♪

29:19.628 --> 29:20.994
♪ Who's that woman? ♪

29:20.996 --> 29:22.229
♪ That wonderful woman... ♪

29:22.231 --> 29:24.364
Hey.

29:24.366 --> 29:26.066
That your virtual black box?

29:26.068 --> 29:27.868
Virtually.

29:27.870 --> 29:30.804
Every bit of information from the
roughly two dozen passengers

29:30.806 --> 29:31.905
using the in-flight Wi-Fi.

29:31.907 --> 29:36.009
Selfies from 22D, drink orders from 12A,

29:36.011 --> 29:37.878
oh, an epic Twitter fight

29:37.880 --> 29:39.913
between the sisters in 18B and C.

29:39.915 --> 29:41.882
How did you get all of...

29:41.884 --> 29:43.150
You know what?

29:43.152 --> 29:44.218
Forget that I asked.

29:44.220 --> 29:45.719
Um, anything that's gonna help us?

29:45.721 --> 29:48.188
Yeah, I'm getting to that.

29:48.190 --> 29:50.524
This tweet from 8C.

29:50.526 --> 29:52.461
"Woman in 8D just
stomped her foot so hard

29:52.615 --> 29:55.162
she broke her heel. #FlightRage."

29:55.164 --> 29:57.331
Okay, what else?

29:57.333 --> 30:00.601
"Woman in 8D apologized.
Said she just got dumped."

30:00.603 --> 30:03.103
Juicy. And sad.

30:03.105 --> 30:04.438
Dumped by who?

30:04.440 --> 30:05.639
(typing)

30:05.641 --> 30:08.242
"Woman in 8D pretty much
threw herself at the pilot

30:08.244 --> 30:09.543
when he went to the bathroom."

30:09.545 --> 30:11.178
Who is this woman?

30:13.749 --> 30:15.382
(typing)

30:15.384 --> 30:16.984
Tanya Bryant.

30:16.986 --> 30:18.076
Twenty-nine.

30:18.213 --> 30:20.220
An accountant for a
department store in Manhattan.

30:20.222 --> 30:24.324
I think we just found
our copilot's mistress.

30:24.326 --> 30:25.325
Nice.

30:25.327 --> 30:26.894
Well done, well done.

30:26.896 --> 30:30.664
So, Tanya flew three round-trip
flights on Essence Airlines

30:30.666 --> 30:32.420
in the last month leading
up to the crash.

30:32.421 --> 30:34.234
CABLE: And all the flights
have one thing in common.

30:34.236 --> 30:35.602
Bad food? Crying babies?

30:35.604 --> 30:37.848
Ken Fowler as copilot.

30:37.887 --> 30:40.955
So Ken and Tanya were having
an airborne romance,

30:40.957 --> 30:42.557
not Ken and Taylor.

30:42.559 --> 30:45.093
So why didn't Taylor say any of this?

30:45.095 --> 30:47.161
Hmm.

30:53.436 --> 30:56.003
Hey.

30:56.005 --> 30:58.706
So Ken was having an affair with Tanya.

30:58.708 --> 31:01.175
Not you.

31:01.177 --> 31:03.177
You think maybe Ken was distracted,

31:03.179 --> 31:06.147
too distracted to help
you with the wind shear?

31:07.317 --> 31:09.484
We ran Ken's affair past a mock jury.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.954
Instead of seeing Ken as
questioning your decisions,

31:12.956 --> 31:17.258
they found him preoccupied,
not focused on flying.

31:17.260 --> 31:19.594
And they found you not guilty.

31:25.235 --> 31:26.534
No.

31:26.536 --> 31:29.070
You know, so what if Ken
might've been distracted?

31:29.072 --> 31:31.305
I was the pilot, I
made all the decisions.

31:31.307 --> 31:33.274
I flew the plane, not Ken.

31:33.276 --> 31:34.809
It-it wouldn't have made a difference.

31:34.811 --> 31:36.177
Taylor, I get it.

31:36.179 --> 31:38.579
You don't want to throw your
dead friend under the bus.

31:38.581 --> 31:41.616
But you know in your
heart that Ken's affair

31:41.618 --> 31:43.751
had nothing to do with this crash.

31:43.753 --> 31:45.586
Right?

31:47.557 --> 31:49.390
Look, I'm taking the settlement.

31:49.392 --> 31:51.459
You can't do that.

31:51.461 --> 31:54.195
Trust me, you'll regret
it for the rest of your life.

31:54.197 --> 31:56.264
Maybe they're right. Maybe I panicked.

31:56.266 --> 31:57.365
Did you?

31:57.367 --> 31:59.000
I don't remember.

31:59.002 --> 32:00.868
So you just want to give up?

32:00.870 --> 32:02.078
Settle?

32:02.295 --> 32:03.738
I guess it's what a woman would do.

32:03.740 --> 32:05.640
- Take the blame.
- Excuse me?

32:05.642 --> 32:08.309
Well, martyrdom is a classic
female response to tragedy.

32:08.311 --> 32:10.978
Do you have any idea what
I have been through

32:10.980 --> 32:13.181
my entire life as a pilot?

32:13.183 --> 32:16.818
Are you telling me you
want to give that up?

32:20.390 --> 32:21.989
Come with me.

32:29.833 --> 32:32.066
Okay, you got me here. Now what?

32:32.068 --> 32:33.768
Well, the simulator is gonna recreate

32:33.770 --> 32:34.735
the exact conditions...

32:34.737 --> 32:37.305
Yeah, I know what a simulator does.

32:42.712 --> 32:46.214
I haven't flown since the accident.

32:46.216 --> 32:49.584
I'll be right here with you.

32:49.586 --> 32:51.986
I know this isn't easy.

32:51.988 --> 32:55.389
I promise it'll get
easier if you fly again.

33:05.869 --> 33:07.235
MAN: All right, Dr. Bull,

33:07.237 --> 33:08.870
we're ready to begin the simulation.

33:08.872 --> 33:09.904
(simulator powering up)

33:09.906 --> 33:12.440
BULL: Okay, we're gonna pick up

33:12.442 --> 33:14.809
right after Ken got back to the cockpit.

33:17.647 --> 33:18.713
(electronic bell chimes)

33:18.715 --> 33:20.982
- Passing outer marker.
- (thunder rumbling)

33:20.984 --> 33:21.983
ILS approach

33:21.985 --> 33:23.518
1-6, cleared to land.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.686
MAN: Radar contact, cleared
to land, runway 1-6.

33:25.688 --> 33:28.222
Ceiling 2-0-0, visibility
one-quarter mile,

33:28.224 --> 33:30.525
wind one-niner-zero, variable 2-5 gust,

33:30.527 --> 33:33.261
gust to 0-4-1 wind
shear all four quadrants.

33:35.363 --> 33:37.663
(rumbling)

33:39.631 --> 33:41.568
BULL: Wonder how many people

33:41.569 --> 33:43.102
get airsick in one of these things.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.336
(loud rumbling)

33:44.338 --> 33:46.138
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Wind
shear, wind shear, wind shear.

33:46.140 --> 33:48.407
(alarm beeping)

33:49.343 --> 33:51.177
BULL: Wind shear. Lost 20 knots.

33:51.179 --> 33:52.311
Cross control, 0500.

33:52.313 --> 33:53.746
BULL: Can't... Throttle's up.

33:53.748 --> 33:54.880
What are you doing?

33:54.882 --> 33:56.115
On the go. Got to take it around.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.550
BULL: That's against protocol.

33:57.552 --> 33:58.884
Repeat, against protocol.

33:58.886 --> 34:00.686
Clean it up. Full power.

34:03.624 --> 34:05.558
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Terrain... pull up.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.626
- No.
- Terrain... pull up.

34:07.628 --> 34:08.828
Five more seconds.

34:08.830 --> 34:12.531
Terrain... pull up. Terrain... pull up.

34:12.533 --> 34:14.733
Terrain... pull up.

34:14.735 --> 34:18.804
Terrain... pull up. Terrain... pull up.

34:18.806 --> 34:21.540
Terrain... pull up.

34:21.542 --> 34:23.074
Terrain...

34:23.077 --> 34:25.844
(rumbling stops)

34:25.847 --> 34:27.478
(panting)

34:29.317 --> 34:31.183
You know what you did?

34:33.920 --> 34:36.455
I got five seconds more
flight out of that plane.

34:36.456 --> 34:40.059
Five seconds is the difference
between putting that plane down

34:40.061 --> 34:43.728
on an empty road or in a
neighborhood filled with people.

34:45.099 --> 34:47.433
Taylor, you didn't want to relive it

34:47.435 --> 34:49.735
because you were
afraid they were right...

34:49.737 --> 34:51.904
That you lost control, but you didn't.

34:54.708 --> 34:56.574
How did you know?

34:56.577 --> 34:59.712
Because you're a fighter.

34:59.714 --> 35:02.181
And a fighter pilot.

35:02.984 --> 35:05.217
And another thing I do know

35:05.219 --> 35:07.253
is that you saved more
lives than your own.

35:07.255 --> 35:09.588
And the jury's never heard that.

35:10.925 --> 35:13.025
Now... (sighs)

35:13.027 --> 35:16.262
you still want to take that settlement?

35:28.889 --> 35:30.855
BENNY: Captain Mathison,

35:30.857 --> 35:31.990
what were you thinking

35:31.992 --> 35:33.758
when the plane lost
power in the wind shear?

35:33.760 --> 35:36.200
Objection. That is not the NTSB's video.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.929
Your Honor, the video has been modified

35:37.931 --> 35:39.497
in one specific way,

35:39.499 --> 35:42.494
and that is to show the
jury what was on the ground.

35:42.651 --> 35:43.516
JUDGE: I'll allow it,

35:43.679 --> 35:44.869
but only for that reason.

35:44.871 --> 35:46.638
Watch your step, Mr. Colón.

35:47.210 --> 35:48.409
I don't remember, actually,

35:48.411 --> 35:49.977
due to head trauma from the crash.

35:49.979 --> 35:51.379
BENNY: You flew a simulation earlier

35:51.381 --> 35:53.947
that replicated the conditions.

35:53.948 --> 35:55.511
And you performed the same maneuver.

35:55.876 --> 35:56.918
Why?

35:56.920 --> 35:58.085
It was the only way to get

35:58.087 --> 35:59.987
a few more seconds
flight out of the plane.

36:01.891 --> 36:03.491
But it wasn't protocol.

36:05.261 --> 36:07.562
Even your copilot
asked what you were doing.

36:07.564 --> 36:09.330
It would have taken too long to explain.

36:09.332 --> 36:10.898
He was never a military pilot.

36:10.900 --> 36:12.700
Anyway, there was nothing for him to do.

36:12.702 --> 36:15.603
I was in full command of the aircraft.

36:18.107 --> 36:20.208
Why was it important for the plane

36:20.210 --> 36:22.210
to stay in the air a few extra seconds?

36:22.212 --> 36:26.080
To veer the plane to
an unpopulated area.

36:27.617 --> 36:29.884
If I couldn't save the
lives of the people on board,

36:29.886 --> 36:32.086
at least I could
save lives on the ground.

36:32.088 --> 36:33.688
(whispers): Yeah.

36:44.300 --> 36:47.301
Captain Mathison
solidified these ten jurors today.

36:47.303 --> 36:48.636
But?

36:48.638 --> 36:50.137
But what does a twister aficionado

36:50.139 --> 36:52.907
have in common with
a former infantryman?

36:52.909 --> 36:54.208
- Besides flexibility?
- Oh...

36:54.210 --> 36:55.877
Benny's closing argument
brings them both to tears.

36:55.879 --> 36:57.612
- BENNY: I'm working on it.
- You've already tried

36:57.614 --> 36:59.046
five different versions in mock court.

36:59.048 --> 37:00.982
I know, but none of them are right.

37:00.984 --> 37:02.550
None of them got us the win.

37:02.552 --> 37:04.485
They just haven't figured
out that gender

37:04.487 --> 37:06.020
plays into Taylor's case.

37:06.022 --> 37:09.056
Incredibly, their mirror
jurors still think she panicked.

37:09.058 --> 37:12.293
All right, I got it. (sighs)

37:14.130 --> 37:15.696
You think he has it?

37:15.698 --> 37:17.498
Not quite. But he will.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.433
Where's Chunk? I'll find him.

37:23.539 --> 37:25.539
CHUNK: Bull says you may need

37:25.541 --> 37:27.742
a new tie.

37:27.744 --> 37:29.911
Really?

37:29.913 --> 37:31.245
Yeah.

37:31.247 --> 37:32.480
I'd stay away from stripes

37:32.482 --> 37:34.882
if you're trying to
project a progressive image.

37:37.387 --> 37:39.587
I can't crack my closing argument.

37:39.589 --> 37:42.390
I thought closings were your thing.

37:42.392 --> 37:45.326
Yeah, when I was a prosecutor.

37:45.328 --> 37:48.029
But since then, I've been in mock court.

37:48.031 --> 37:50.197
You can lose 100
times and it doesn't matter,

37:50.199 --> 37:52.500
but today...

37:52.502 --> 37:54.568
only get one shot.

37:56.039 --> 37:58.773
I don't know if this helps, but
when I played for Georgia,

37:58.775 --> 38:00.441
there was a rumor going around that

38:00.443 --> 38:03.077
someone on the team was gay.

38:03.079 --> 38:04.879
I remember that next practice,

38:04.881 --> 38:07.815
I tackled that quarterback so hard...

38:07.817 --> 38:09.383
he was out for a week.

38:09.385 --> 38:12.219
We lost our next game,

38:12.221 --> 38:15.289
but no one suspected that I was gay.

38:15.291 --> 38:18.759
It never occurred to them that a gay man

38:18.761 --> 38:21.362
could hit that hard.

38:21.364 --> 38:23.965
At least not until our ten-year reunion.

38:23.967 --> 38:25.733
(chuckles softly)

38:29.205 --> 38:31.939
Chunk.

38:31.941 --> 38:33.908
Thank you.

38:33.910 --> 38:36.110
Tell Bull I said thanks for the tie.

38:39.082 --> 38:41.515
Now, bear with me.

38:41.517 --> 38:44.051
I'm gonna show you three
pictures that tell a story.

38:44.053 --> 38:46.721
Okay? Here we go.

38:46.723 --> 38:51.459
Now, as you can see, these
kids are getting bullied.

38:51.461 --> 38:53.794
Then one of them fights back.

38:54.931 --> 38:56.664
Here they are

38:56.666 --> 38:58.599
in the principal's office.

39:00.069 --> 39:02.703
And here's the bully,

39:02.705 --> 39:05.106
nursing his black eye.

39:06.642 --> 39:08.576
Okay, now,

39:08.578 --> 39:10.344
as a show of hands,

39:10.346 --> 39:11.545
what was the color shirt

39:11.547 --> 39:14.315
of the kid who confronted the bully?

39:14.317 --> 39:16.484
Was it a blue shirt?

39:18.121 --> 39:20.421
Okay, well, let's take a look,

39:20.423 --> 39:22.690
see if we're right.

39:25.495 --> 39:28.462
If you all guessed blue, you were wrong.

39:29.365 --> 39:31.932
The kid who confronted the bully

39:31.934 --> 39:34.769
was wearing the red shirt.

39:35.571 --> 39:38.272
See, I never specified

39:38.274 --> 39:40.241
which kid confronted the bully.

39:40.243 --> 39:42.376
You all just assumed

39:42.378 --> 39:43.811
it was the boy.

39:43.813 --> 39:47.448
Now, come on, I admit

39:47.450 --> 39:50.985
I failed the test, too.

39:52.355 --> 39:56.257
See, it's hard to imagine a
girl being the hero of the story.

39:56.259 --> 39:58.526
Just like it's hard to imagine

39:58.528 --> 40:00.661
Captain Mathison

40:00.663 --> 40:03.931
being the hero of the one in this court.

40:03.933 --> 40:06.400
But she is.

40:07.503 --> 40:09.637
She doesn't deserve to be punished

40:09.639 --> 40:11.238
for our failings.

40:11.240 --> 40:14.608
She deserves to be thanked for
the lives that she saved.

40:17.480 --> 40:20.247
We need to find her not guilty.

40:31.260 --> 40:32.860
JUDGE: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

40:32.862 --> 40:34.595
have you reached a verdict?

40:34.597 --> 40:36.430
We have, Your Honor.

40:36.432 --> 40:38.466
JUDGE: What say you?

40:38.468 --> 40:41.836
FOREMAN: As to the
charge of gross negligence,

40:41.838 --> 40:44.705
we find the defendant not guilty.

40:44.707 --> 40:46.907
(gallery murmuring)

40:50.279 --> 40:53.080
That's one in the win column.

40:54.851 --> 40:57.618
Very nice to meet you.

40:57.620 --> 40:59.487
Hey. Oh.

40:59.489 --> 41:01.288
(chuckles) Thank you so much.

41:01.290 --> 41:03.224
Of course. Of course.

41:04.093 --> 41:05.659
Of course.

41:05.661 --> 41:07.828
Mary.

41:08.664 --> 41:10.764
Hi, guys. Hi.

41:10.766 --> 41:12.233
Come here.

41:16.973 --> 41:18.739
Thanks.

BULL: May I approach the bar?

Ah, yes, you may.

(chuckles): Aha.

Congratulations, Dr. Bull.

41:33.356 --> 41:34.488
You, too.

41:34.490 --> 41:36.390
Showed a new speed in court today.

41:36.392 --> 41:37.858
Yeah, yeah.

41:37.860 --> 41:39.660
I picked up a few new moves here.

41:39.662 --> 41:40.694
I saw that.

41:40.696 --> 41:42.396
Well, I may start calling on you

41:42.398 --> 41:44.865
more often out there.

Excuse me, Jay.

Milady.

Thank you.

41:57.380 --> 41:59.079
I got a sweet little gift from Vince.

41:59.081 --> 42:01.048
- (imitates Vince): "Rock on."

42:01.050 --> 42:04.251
Heard the airline
settled with the families.

Double what they would have paid

if Taylor had been found guilty.

So... how's my team?

Right where you want 'em.
