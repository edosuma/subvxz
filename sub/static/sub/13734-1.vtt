00:59.600 --> 01:03.850
To tell ya the truth,
I never was much for the holidays.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.950
It's been forever
since I'd known a holiday,

01:07.020 --> 01:09.870
since I'd seen my family,

01:09.990 --> 01:14.050
since I'd been with a girl,
since I'd driven a car.

01:14.120 --> 01:17.190
You see, cars are what put me here.

01:17.260 --> 01:20.100
Iron Mountain, maximum security.

01:20.170 --> 01:23.020
I was riding a hard five
for grand theft auto.

01:23.080 --> 01:28.010
Meanwhile, my esteemed raping and murdering
colleagues were up for parole at three.

01:28.070 --> 01:30.380
World works like that sometimes.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.560
All the time in my experience.

01:32.620 --> 01:37.290
That's me, Rudy Duncan,
menace to society, on the left.

01:37.360 --> 01:40.400
The guy on the right's
Nick Cassidy, my best friend.

01:40.460 --> 01:43.020
Back then, we were both looking
at three days to a new start.

01:43.090 --> 01:45.680
That's what ya talk about
inprison.

01:45.740 --> 01:49.930
How you're gonna get it right.
How you'll never make the same mistakes.

01:57.230 --> 01:59.920
We walk outta here, we hit that road,

01:59.990 --> 02:02.060
what's the first thing
you're gonna do ?

02:02.130 --> 02:04.880
Hot chocolate.

02:04.940 --> 02:08.180
- What ?
- That's the first thing I'm gonna do.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.479
I'm gonna go out and get myself
a mug of hot chocolate.

02:10.550 --> 02:12.370
And a piece of pecan pie.

02:12.430 --> 02:15.570
That's right.
A piece of pecan pie.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.650
Yeah.

02:17.710 --> 02:20.630
She's gonna be
out there, man.

02:20.690 --> 02:23.920
She's gonna be
right there waiting.

02:23.990 --> 02:27.450
She got us a motel
on Highway 5.

02:27.500 --> 02:30.770
Lock ourselves in
the whole week,

02:30.840 --> 02:34.260
drinkin' wine,
takin' baths, man.

02:38.350 --> 02:40.220
Yeah.

02:41.880 --> 02:45.210
Nick, all those pictures
she sent ?

02:45.300 --> 02:47.670
You sure that's really her
in the pictures ?

02:47.730 --> 02:50.350
I did hear sometimes these girls
send pictures that's not really them.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.140
It's like their prettier cousin
or somethin' like that.

02:53.210 --> 02:55.440
Why ya gotta say
a thing like that, man ?

02:55.510 --> 02:58.070
- I'm just sayin'...
- Why ya gotta say a thing like that ?

02:58.130 --> 03:02.260
I'm just sayin',
maybe I should take her out.

03:02.330 --> 03:05.370
Spend a day or two with her.
Make sure she's the right girl.

03:05.430 --> 03:09.530
Just a day or two.
Maybe a night or two ?

03:09.600 --> 03:12.980
Whatever it takes. Just make sure
you're gettin' the right merchandise.

03:13.050 --> 03:16.570
- You know ?
- You know what ?

03:16.630 --> 03:19.000
Enjoy your hot chocolate, Rudy.

03:19.060 --> 03:22.490
I think I'll take my chances
with Ashley.

03:23.810 --> 03:26.650
Yeah, I figured.
I figured.

03:29.210 --> 03:34.140
- Hold it up close.
- Pop gate three.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.700
Oh, shit !

03:36.770 --> 03:40.060
- What's up ?
- Alamo's back.

03:40.160 --> 03:43.390
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.

03:43.450 --> 03:45.950
Bro, I'm fucked.

03:46.010 --> 03:48.830
Pincher said he thinks I'm the one
who ratted him out for beating up Creed.

03:48.890 --> 03:51.360
'Cause I was there, he thinks
I'm the reason he ended up in solitar.

03:51.420 --> 03:53.500
Fuck, Rudy.

03:53.570 --> 03:55.450
Move out!

04:04.710 --> 04:06.850
And stop !

04:07.870 --> 04:10.470
Move in !

04:10.520 --> 04:12.390
Listen to this.

04:12.440 --> 04:15.170
"I've made my list
and I've checked it twice.

04:15.230 --> 04:18.750
"As long as you're naughty,
it's gonna be nice.

04:18.820 --> 04:23.910
"All that gets me through the day, is to
close my eyes and imagine holding you,

04:23.970 --> 04:26.460
"kissing you, touching you.

04:26.530 --> 04:30.250
"Because I know I'll feel
at that moment...

04:30.300 --> 04:34.210
I've found the reason
for my whole entire life."

04:34.280 --> 04:36.580
She sounds pretty mature
for 25.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.140
Yeah !

04:39.200 --> 04:41.540
You grow up in Detroit,
you get matured real quick.

04:41.600 --> 04:45.700
Yeah. Either that
or those pictures are ten years old.

04:48.580 --> 04:52.520
Sure as hell don't
make me miss Millie Bobeck.

04:52.580 --> 04:55.590
Guess I owe Millie, though.

04:55.650 --> 04:58.120
Ifl hadn't been
rolling her,

04:58.180 --> 05:00.390
I would've never
ended up here.

05:00.450 --> 05:03.950
Yeah. You hadn't have cracked that guy's head open,
you never would've found true love.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.280
Jealous.

05:06.350 --> 05:10.720
Ya know, Nick, what if
she sees you and, you know,

05:10.790 --> 05:13.380
you just don't do it for her,
you know, I mean physically ?

05:13.450 --> 05:17.350
She just... It's not there.
What're you gonna do ?

05:17.420 --> 05:21.960
Well, me and her,
we got a connection.

05:28.010 --> 05:29.930
Jesus Christ.
Get this fuckin' shit...

05:29.990 --> 05:32.270
- out of my face.
- You should've written to that magazine.

05:32.330 --> 05:34.190
I should've, yeah.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.170
I'm gonna walk outta here. I'm gonna
walk right into a relationship.

05:37.220 --> 05:41.260
And you, my friend,
will walk out with your bus fare.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.270
Searching for
the drunkest skirt in the room.

05:43.340 --> 05:47.050
That's right.
"Morning, gorgeous. More eggnog ?"

05:47.110 --> 05:52.590
- Should've written, Rudy.
You'd have got yourself a girl.

05:52.650 --> 05:55.820
Yeah, should've done
a lot of things.

05:57.710 --> 06:02.320
All I want is just
to make it back to Sidnaw,

06:02.380 --> 06:05.590
sit down for Christmas dinner,

06:05.640 --> 06:08.370
sleep in my old bed,

06:08.430 --> 06:12.110
watch some ball games
with my old man,

06:12.170 --> 06:15.090
eat leftovers for about six months.

06:15.150 --> 06:17.840
I just wanna go home.

06:41.810 --> 06:43.510
Keep the line movin'.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.230
- What's this ?
- Holiday Jell-O.

06:46.290 --> 06:50.070
- What this shit in it ?
- Swallow it and you'll see.

06:50.130 --> 06:53.720
Just so you know,

06:53.780 --> 06:56.820
this man and I are outta here
in two days.

06:56.880 --> 07:00.120
So while we're inhaling
London broil and lobster bisque,

07:00.180 --> 07:04.090
you're still gonna be standing
here smelling up the myster cream fuck.

07:04.150 --> 07:07.280
Who's in prison now ?

07:09.240 --> 07:11.600
Hey, Alamo, how ya doin' ?

07:11.670 --> 07:14.810
Out of solitar ?
Look good. Lose some weight ?

07:16.370 --> 07:18.710
Look, man,
it wasn't me.

07:19.900 --> 07:23.350
- It wasn't me.
- Two days, man. Come on.

07:29.430 --> 07:33.180
Remember how her brother's
a truck driver down there ?

07:33.240 --> 07:35.770
I'm thinkin' he might be able
to get me some work.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.430
What work, security ?

07:38.490 --> 07:41.150
I'm through with that shit.
Ashley's right.

07:41.210 --> 07:45.950
I gotta start doin' somethin'
I got a stake in, get a business goin'.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.690
I don't know, man.
I been in the business world.

07:49.760 --> 07:54.200
Hot-wiring cars, Rudy, does not
qualify you as a small business.

07:54.270 --> 07:56.510
"Chop-shop consultant"
doesn't work on a resume.

07:56.580 --> 07:59.870
I always wanted to be
the boss of something, ya know?

07:59.960 --> 08:02.720
Have people working for me.

08:05.750 --> 08:08.830
Man, what's wrong with you ?

08:08.890 --> 08:11.680
Monsters... in the gelatin.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.720
- It's just a roach, Zook.
- Yeah, it's protein. It's good for ya.

08:14.780 --> 08:19.520
- Monsters... in the gelatin !
- Calm down.

08:19.620 --> 08:24.350
There are monsters
in the gelatin !

08:24.450 --> 08:28.260
Monsters... in the gelatin !

08:28.320 --> 08:30.760
Look at this shit !

08:30.810 --> 08:32.390
Hey ! Jesus !

08:32.450 --> 08:35.610
- Sit down !
- Son of a bitch !

08:36.710 --> 08:40.000
You eat this shit !

08:40.070 --> 08:44.200
- Get down, don't move.
- Stay out of it, Rudy !

08:45.980 --> 08:50.020
You want
some fucking monsters ?

08:51.620 --> 08:53.350
Two days, man.

08:53.410 --> 08:57.570
Fuck !

09:01.540 --> 09:03.240
Don't move !

09:04.580 --> 09:06.470
We had nothing to do with it!

09:09.770 --> 09:11.850
Rudy, watch out !

09:23.270 --> 09:26.310
Cassidy's down ! Cassidy's stabbed!

09:26.380 --> 09:29.610
- I gotta be there.
- Oh, my God !

09:29.670 --> 09:31.560
- Rudy, Ashley.
- You're gonna be all right.

09:31.630 --> 09:35.370
- Hold on, hold on. Guard ! Jesus, guards !
- Ashley's gonna be there.

09:35.430 --> 09:38.160
- Nick, you gotta...
- Gotta be...

09:38.210 --> 09:40.580
Guard ! Guards !

09:40.650 --> 09:42.820
Jesus Christ.

09:44.430 --> 09:48.580
- Nick. Nick ! Nick !
- Get him outta here now!

10:03.210 --> 10:06.670
Well, at least
he won't be comin' back.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.030
You need some company tonight, Rudy,
you just give me a holler.

10:19.150 --> 10:23.120
You gonna take that from him ?
You gonna take that shit, Rudy ?

11:15.440 --> 11:19.060
Open outer gate.

11:26.390 --> 11:29.850
Your world and welcome to it,
you dumb fucks.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.510
Don't be a stranger now.
We'll keep the lights on for ya.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.420
Over here !

11:57.180 --> 11:59.390
Over here.
Hey, how you doin' ?

12:22.370 --> 12:26.210
"And all that gets me
through the day, is to close my eyes...

12:26.300 --> 12:30.110
"and imagine holding you,
kissing you,

12:30.210 --> 12:33.760
touching you."

12:33.860 --> 12:38.590
Don't do it, Rudy.
Don't you fucking do it !

12:47.520 --> 12:50.470
Jesus Christ.

13:22.180 --> 13:24.800
Are you Ashley ?

13:29.380 --> 13:31.400
I'm Nick !

13:54.920 --> 13:57.290
Look, Ashley, I'm sorry.

13:57.390 --> 13:59.940
I was scared that
I was gonna walk out there,

14:00.040 --> 14:03.010
and you were gonna take one look
at me and just... turn around.

14:03.110 --> 14:06.030
I was scared I was walkin'
into heartache.

14:06.130 --> 14:09.800
All those letters, those words,
and you have a picture in your mind.

14:11.370 --> 14:16.110
I was scared you'd see me,
and I just wouldn't be that...

14:16.170 --> 14:18.410
picture that you had
in your mind.

14:18.510 --> 14:22.380
I figured you walked outta there
and saw my clothes or something,

14:22.480 --> 14:25.140
and you just walked
right the other way.

14:25.230 --> 14:28.940
- You know, maybe you saw my coat or my hair...
- Hey, I like your coat !

14:29.030 --> 14:31.240
Maybe you...

14:32.780 --> 14:35.890
Maybe you saw me and I didn't...

14:35.990 --> 14:39.690
Ashley, no. That was me.

14:43.980 --> 14:47.410
I thought you said you,
had curly hair.

14:47.510 --> 14:50.060
I do. It's ver curly.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.580
When it gets long, it's really curly.
But I cut it short.

14:53.680 --> 14:57.170
I can grow it out again, if you want.
I can get it pretty bushy.

14:57.260 --> 15:00.590
No ! No, no, no.

15:00.690 --> 15:03.830
I want you to be
who you wanna be.

15:03.920 --> 15:06.090
Do that again.

15:06.190 --> 15:08.630
What ?

15:08.730 --> 15:10.290
Smile like that.

15:13.460 --> 15:16.150
Come on.
One more time.

15:22.030 --> 15:25.750
God, I have been dreaming
about that smile...

15:25.840 --> 15:28.310
for so long,

15:28.410 --> 15:30.770
Ashley Mercer.

15:35.220 --> 15:39.480
You're better than the pictures
in my mind, Nick.

15:42.430 --> 15:44.690
You're real !

16:50.880 --> 16:53.050
Can I ask you somethin' ?

16:53.120 --> 16:55.970
Is this the first time you ever
done somethin' like this ?

16:57.630 --> 17:00.220
You, look at you.

17:00.290 --> 17:03.420
So pretty, sweet.

17:03.490 --> 17:07.589
Why were you writing to a guy,
some con, you don't even know ?

17:07.650 --> 17:11.390
- I told you, Nick. Remember ?
- Tell me again.

17:16.480 --> 17:20.450
All the guys
I've ever been with,

17:20.510 --> 17:23.720
they never wanted
to get to know me.

17:26.410 --> 17:30.150
Who I am... inside.

17:30.210 --> 17:33.760
They just wanted to...
get inside.

17:36.010 --> 17:38.700
A guy like you, Nick.

17:38.750 --> 17:43.110
God, I mean, six months
before you could even touch my face.

17:44.610 --> 17:46.690
I figure
a guy like that...

17:46.760 --> 17:50.560
is gonna have to work
to get to know me some other way.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.870
But when I read
what you wrote to me,

18:08.390 --> 18:12.300
"Here's a guy they say is a criminal,
but he's not.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.220
"Just protected his girl.

18:14.280 --> 18:19.430
"Somebody got killed,
but he's not a killer...

18:20.870 --> 18:26.060
"'cause he did what he had to do
to save somebody.

18:26.130 --> 18:29.830
And the world just
didn't see it that way."

18:29.900 --> 18:32.170
State of Michigan, anyway.

18:32.230 --> 18:35.500
You wrote me
some wonderful things.

18:35.560 --> 18:38.860
It wasn't all me, you know.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.490
It was all you.

18:41.550 --> 18:45.960
The guy I was in with, you know,
he helped me with some of the romantic stuff.

18:46.030 --> 18:48.020
He's a good guy, actually.
You'd like him.

18:48.070 --> 18:53.200
I'm talkin' about the heart,
not the words.

18:53.260 --> 18:55.890
Yeah, well,

18:55.950 --> 18:59.180
some of the heart
might've been his too.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.100
Yeah ?

19:09.580 --> 19:13.610
You should've signed his name,
then he'd be here right now.

19:35.350 --> 19:38.290
Merry Christmas !

19:38.360 --> 19:41.650
Merry Christmas, Santa !

19:41.720 --> 19:44.150
Provisions, Nick.
Provisions.

19:44.210 --> 19:46.320
Come here.
You need a coat.

19:46.390 --> 19:50.390
No boyfriend of mine is gonna walk around
in a negative five degree wind chill...

19:50.450 --> 19:52.340
without a good-looking goddamn coat.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.280
But you already got me all this stuff.
I didn't get you anything.

19:56.340 --> 20:00.080
Nick, you got out.
You're here.

20:00.150 --> 20:02.520
You're my Christmas.

20:02.580 --> 20:04.880
It's $ 200, Ash.

20:04.950 --> 20:09.660
I know !
But you forget where I work.

20:09.720 --> 20:14.970
- Beauty and fragrances.
- Yep. Fifty percent off, my friend.

20:25.310 --> 20:27.680
Just till the holidays, Nick.

20:27.730 --> 20:30.040
We'll let her have her holidays,

20:30.110 --> 20:32.000
then we'll tell her.

20:49.690 --> 20:52.640
I'm gonna tell them not to bother us
for the rest of the year.

20:52.700 --> 20:57.590
When I get back in that room, you better
be wearing nothing but a candy cane.

21:04.030 --> 21:07.770
I have no gifts to bring

21:12.450 --> 21:16.550
A gift to give a King

21:16.600 --> 21:20.220
I've got a girl...

21:20.290 --> 21:22.140
Hi, Nick.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.930
Ah, shit !

21:50.150 --> 21:52.710
I oweyou a drink !

21:56.260 --> 21:58.120
Welcome home, Nick.

22:01.830 --> 22:03.790
Look, man, you don't know me.

22:03.840 --> 22:07.270
I know ya.

22:07.340 --> 22:09.220
- I know you real well.
- You can't.

22:09.290 --> 22:11.240
The hell I can't.

22:11.300 --> 22:13.250
- Watch out, baby,
- Ashley !

22:13.320 --> 22:15.790
I'm bringin' in the tree !

22:28.080 --> 22:32.230
Looks like somebody's
been havin' some fun.

22:35.790 --> 22:39.080
Hey, sis, happy holidays.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.350
No ! You bastard ! No !

22:41.420 --> 22:44.990
- Take it easy. Don't hurt her.
- Right. Sorry, Monster.

22:47.720 --> 22:50.410
So,

22:50.480 --> 22:54.800
this is the guy you've been waitin' for,
the man of your dreams.

22:54.860 --> 22:56.880
Gabriel, what are you doing ?

22:56.940 --> 23:00.680
- I read a lot about you, Nick.
- Gabriel, what are you doing here ?

23:00.750 --> 23:04.230
I read you're a man
of some knowledge.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.020
- Gabriel.
- A man of some travels.

23:07.090 --> 23:12.340
Look, man, I'm not him. Whatever you
want from Nick, you got the wrong guy.

23:12.400 --> 23:17.960
- Nick ?
- I'm sorry, Ashley. I'm sorry.

23:19.690 --> 23:23.700
No ! No !

23:23.760 --> 23:27.990
- Who are you now ?
- I'm not him, man !

23:28.050 --> 23:31.210
- She just thinks I'm Nick. I'm not him.
- Put him in the truck.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.130
Wait a minute !
I was in the joint with him.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.760
That's how I knew about him and her.
I took his place.

23:35.820 --> 23:40.280
- You what ?
- Okay. I got out. Nick didn't.

23:40.330 --> 23:44.240
I knew about her letters,
and Jesus Christ, man,

23:44.310 --> 23:46.860
whatever you want from Nick,
I'm not him, okay ?

23:46.930 --> 23:49.170
I just... I wanted to be.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.890
You're not Nick Cassidy ?

23:55.960 --> 23:58.960
No, man, I just shared his cell.

23:59.030 --> 24:01.910
But you were saying you were.

24:01.980 --> 24:03.860
Yeah.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.810
So you could get with my sister.

24:06.870 --> 24:08.750
Yeah.

24:08.820 --> 24:13.170
- So you could get down her chimney.
- Yeah.

24:14.750 --> 24:17.340
And you think tellin' me,
that's gonna help your cause.

24:19.740 --> 24:22.230
No !

24:22.290 --> 24:24.400
No ! No !

24:24.470 --> 24:28.150
- Is this him ?
- Please don't hurt him, Gabriel. Don't !

24:28.220 --> 24:31.930
- Is this the fucker you been writin' all year ?
- Don't ! Please, don't.

24:31.990 --> 24:34.770
- Is this Nick Cassidy ?
- Yes !

24:34.840 --> 24:37.630
Yes !

24:37.690 --> 24:41.490
Well, he better learn
to give you some respect.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.100
- Get her outta here.
- No !

24:49.050 --> 24:50.900
No !

24:53.050 --> 24:55.030
Man, they got a shitload
of cookies.

24:55.100 --> 24:56.660
Take 'em.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.830
What about the tree ?

24:59.900 --> 25:03.620
- You want the tree ?
- Yeah.

25:14.940 --> 25:17.690
I read your letters, convict.

25:20.730 --> 25:23.780
Don't play no reindeer games
with me.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.160
He read your letters.

25:36.220 --> 25:39.720
One day I wasn't there
and he came in.

25:39.770 --> 25:43.040
Jane tried to stop him,
but he read your letters.

25:43.110 --> 25:45.820
What letters ?

25:45.890 --> 25:48.550
He knows you worked
at that casino.

25:54.370 --> 25:57.820
What ?
Oh, my God, you set him up !

25:57.890 --> 26:00.220
No, no, I didn't. I didn't.

26:00.290 --> 26:03.140
When did you decide
to do it, Ash ?

26:03.200 --> 26:07.370
After which one of his letters ?
What, the for tieth, fiftieth ? The first ? What ?

26:07.430 --> 26:09.700
- No, Nick, you're not...
- Look, I'm not Nick !

26:09.770 --> 26:13.060
Okay ? You thought
you'd fuck him over ?

26:13.130 --> 26:15.460
Ah, shit ! Guess what ?
He fucked you !

26:15.530 --> 26:19.080
Because I never worked in any casino,
and I can't help you because I'm not him !

26:19.140 --> 26:22.310
- No, you don't understand. I love you !
- Jesus...

26:22.370 --> 26:25.860
- Christ!
- Hey, hey, watch your mouth. It's Christmas.

26:25.930 --> 26:29.000
Listen to me. Listen to me.

26:29.070 --> 26:32.260
My brother has killed people.
I know this.

26:32.330 --> 26:35.080
You don't know him. You don't know
what he's capable of. He will kill you.

26:35.140 --> 26:38.280
If you keep telling him
that you're not you, he will kill you.

26:38.340 --> 26:42.340
Says here the retail industry
does fifty percent of its business...

26:42.410 --> 26:46.350
between December 1 and December 25.

26:46.410 --> 26:49.350
That's half a year's business
in one month's time.

26:49.420 --> 26:54.280
It seems to me an intelligent countr would
legislate a second such gift-giving holiday.

26:54.350 --> 26:57.830
Create, say, a Christmas Two,
late May or early June,

26:57.900 --> 27:00.080
to further stimulate growth.

27:00.140 --> 27:03.880
Ever since you been goin' to night school,
you been giving me headaches, Jumpy.

27:03.950 --> 27:07.430
Christmas Two.

27:16.070 --> 27:18.350
Just...

27:23.530 --> 27:27.920
"My sweet, sexy Ashy-lashy.

27:29.290 --> 27:31.310
"I have been dreaming of you
constantly,

27:31.380 --> 27:33.740
"and knowing you are out there
makes these walls...

27:33.810 --> 27:37.770
"not seem so close
or so strong or so cold.

27:39.120 --> 27:42.130
"Someday I'm gonna take you
up by Lake Superior.

27:42.190 --> 27:46.550
"Before I went in,
before goddamn Millie,

27:46.610 --> 27:48.760
"I used to work up
at this casino,

27:48.810 --> 27:50.990
"workin' security.

27:52.400 --> 27:56.950
"I used to watch for people
stealin' chips, counting cards,

27:57.010 --> 27:58.890
"getting piss-drunk,
that kind of stuff.

27:58.960 --> 28:03.060
Indian place.
Easiest job I ever had."

28:04.080 --> 28:05.940
You're a good writer, Nick.

28:07.480 --> 28:10.930
I give this writing... an A-plus.

28:11.950 --> 28:14.680
You just tell us
what we need to know,

28:14.740 --> 28:18.580
and you two kids, you get to go
live happily-ever-after.

28:18.640 --> 28:22.290
You give me
little nieces and nephews.

28:22.360 --> 28:27.160
- Listen to me, man. I never worked at a casino.
- No, Nick.

28:27.220 --> 28:31.510
That guy who wrote that letter ?
That's Nick Cassidy.

28:31.580 --> 28:33.560
I was in the joint with him.

28:33.620 --> 28:35.510
He rode a two-year
manslaughter bit...

28:35.570 --> 28:38.640
for killing some guy who was bothering
his girlfriend in a bar.

28:38.710 --> 28:43.290
He's dead. He wrote those letters.
He worked at a casino.

28:43.350 --> 28:47.290
Me ? My last job
was at a Quick Lube.

28:47.350 --> 28:51.580
I did five for lifting cars. That's it.
He was my cellmate. That's how l know him.

28:51.640 --> 28:53.950
I'm sorry about your sister.

28:54.010 --> 28:56.350
I just got out of the joint.

28:56.410 --> 28:58.940
I just wanna...

28:59.000 --> 29:01.690
I don't know anything. I don't
remember anybody. I just wanna go home.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.880
- Bur this guy.
- No. Gabriel, no. - What ?

29:13.950 --> 29:17.790
- Gabriel, you promised.
- I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone.

29:17.860 --> 29:19.930
When he helped us.
This guy doesn't wanna play.

29:20.060 --> 29:21.750
No, you promised me!

29:21.850 --> 29:24.800
And you promised me
you'd get your sweetheart to help !

29:26.980 --> 29:30.940
He'd rather die... than be with you.

29:32.550 --> 29:34.750
He'd make a fucked-up
boyfriend anyway.

29:37.250 --> 29:39.320
Bur this guy
all over the place.

29:39.420 --> 29:42.460
No. No ! Gabriel, no !

29:42.560 --> 29:44.960
Shut up !

30:01.440 --> 30:03.330
Don't get no blood
on my shoes.

30:05.340 --> 30:09.470
All right, all right. What do you want to know ?
About the casino, the Tomahawk ?

30:09.570 --> 30:12.740
Jesus Christ,
what do you wanna know ?

30:22.470 --> 30:26.630
Six months writing love letters,
my pen pal fucks me over.

30:26.720 --> 30:29.480
Thanks for the stamps, Ash.

30:29.580 --> 30:31.690
All right.
What do you wanna know ?

30:31.780 --> 30:34.240
Everthing.

30:34.340 --> 30:36.490
Nick, I love you, baby.

30:36.590 --> 30:40.290
- Nick, I love you.
- Hey !

30:40.390 --> 30:43.400
She said she loves you.
Say something.

30:44.460 --> 30:46.630
I had better sex in prison.

30:49.290 --> 30:51.520
Throw him back in the rig.

30:53.220 --> 30:55.430
Monster, he's not the guy.

30:57.570 --> 31:01.320
Whole time you were drivin',
he was tellin' her he's not the guy.

31:01.410 --> 31:05.640
He's not the guy. I understand
why he'd tell us he's not the guy,

31:05.730 --> 31:09.260
but why would he tell her
that he's not the guy ?

31:09.350 --> 31:12.650
Maybe...
Maybe he's not the guy.

31:33.070 --> 31:36.210
Look, if I went in the joint with a library card,
I'd come out with a librar card.

31:40.750 --> 31:45.960
The man who wrote those letters
loved Ashley, boys.

31:46.060 --> 31:48.690
He lived for her.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.030
Where's she work ?

31:55.120 --> 31:57.000
What ?

31:57.100 --> 32:00.080
Wrote you a hundred letters,
didn't she ? Where's she work ?

32:00.170 --> 32:02.000
Lindstrom's, beauty and fragrances.

32:02.090 --> 32:05.140
What's her middle name ?

32:05.230 --> 32:06.870
Samantha.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.860
What'd they call her
in high school ?

32:16.470 --> 32:18.650
- What'd they call her in college ?
- What college ?

32:18.740 --> 32:21.330
- What's her greatest fear ?
- Brother.

32:21.430 --> 32:25.620
Oh, wrong. It's drowning.

32:25.710 --> 32:28.660
Wrong, it's her brother.

32:34.710 --> 32:36.530
That's love.

32:39.630 --> 32:42.990
It's time to start talking,

32:43.090 --> 32:45.150
Nick.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.660
Time to start tellin' tales.

32:51.640 --> 32:55.930
- Get him up here.
- No, no, no ! Fuck that !

32:56.020 --> 32:58.780
Nick doesn't do anything
till Nick gets something for Nick.

32:58.870 --> 33:01.470
Ya got it ?
I want some hot chocolate.

33:03.390 --> 33:05.210
You wanna hear
about some job of mine ?

33:05.310 --> 33:08.570
I wanna see some goddamn
hot chocolate...

33:08.670 --> 33:10.910
and some pecan fuckin' pie !

33:11.100 --> 33:14.810
Sure nice pie.

33:19.770 --> 33:21.820
So, when you worked there...

33:29.690 --> 33:31.520
You knew the place...

33:43.170 --> 33:46.430
Okay.

33:46.530 --> 33:50.390
You know what ? I could really go
for some onion rings.

33:50.490 --> 33:52.640
You said talk.
That's all you s...

33:52.740 --> 33:55.810
Gabriel, you said
you wanted to talk.

34:01.410 --> 34:03.620
- How much money is in that casino ?
- Hard to say.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.280
Well, take a guess.

34:08.830 --> 34:10.429
Five million ?

34:10.530 --> 34:14.300
- Jesus. Come here.
- You, you wrote Ash a letter with a stor...

34:14.400 --> 34:17.540
about working Christmas Eve.

34:17.630 --> 34:20.580
About how they send half the security
guys home. Nobody's comin' in and out.

34:20.679 --> 34:22.820
And the rest of ya
are gettin' shit-faced.

34:22.889 --> 34:25.030
That a true story or not ?

34:25.120 --> 34:27.460
Christmas Eve.

34:27.550 --> 34:31.199
We're takin' down that casino,
convict.

34:31.270 --> 34:35.270
And you're the guy
that's gonna tell us how.

34:38.659 --> 34:40.800
That's what we can see.

34:40.870 --> 34:44.900
Now, you tell us what we can't see.
Where the private doors go,

34:44.969 --> 34:48.260
where the alarms are,
what the upstairs looks like, all of it.

34:48.360 --> 34:51.550
- That's not the Tomahawk.
- What the hell are you talkin' about ?

34:51.650 --> 34:55.850
What's this, the cage ?
I mean, the cage is over here.

34:55.940 --> 34:57.770
Ya got...
This whole thing's mixed up.

34:57.860 --> 34:59.780
- That's what it looks like, Romeo.
- Since when ?

34:59.880 --> 35:01.670
I mean, what's this ?

35:01.770 --> 35:05.640
- That's the prime rib buffet. $ 5.99.
- Buffet ?

35:05.740 --> 35:08.710
Buffet is over here
by the bar.

35:08.810 --> 35:11.690
They must've remodeled
the place.

35:11.760 --> 35:14.020
- What ?
- Big guy, the boss.

35:14.120 --> 35:18.480
- The guy that ran the place, was in charge.
- Jack Bangs.

35:18.570 --> 35:22.250
Jack Bangs ! Was always talkin'
about giving the place a makeover.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.490
Must've gone ahead and done that
while I was in the Mountain.

35:24.580 --> 35:27.340
I mean, this thing's
all changed around.

35:27.430 --> 35:30.090
I can't help you with this. I don't
know where security or anything is.

35:30.190 --> 35:35.140
- I have no idea.
- Look, I don't care about the pancake breakfast. I...

35:35.240 --> 35:37.060
You wanna know about money,
right ?

35:37.160 --> 35:41.330
Okay. Where you got the buffet down here ?
That used to be Bang's office.

35:41.420 --> 35:44.270
And he kept a safe in there.

35:44.360 --> 35:48.870
And that safe had all the money
that he was skimming in there.

35:48.940 --> 35:52.780
- And it was called the pow-wow safe.
- Pow-wow safe ?

35:52.910 --> 35:55.760
Yes, pow-wow safe.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.610
'Cause he was stealing money
from the tribe.

35:58.670 --> 36:01.330
The guy had thousands in there.
Millions probably.

36:01.420 --> 36:05.740
Millions ?
In the pow-wow safe ?

36:05.840 --> 36:08.210
Millions.

36:08.310 --> 36:12.400
But, I mean, you know,

36:12.490 --> 36:15.850
it's just that now you
tell me his office is moved.

36:15.950 --> 36:18.320
God knows what else is different.
You know ?

36:18.390 --> 36:20.270
The security, the...

36:20.340 --> 36:24.400
You want me to show you
what goes where, l have no idea!

36:25.550 --> 36:29.620
Well, I guess
we don't need you then.

36:35.600 --> 36:39.920
Well, not necessarily.

36:40.020 --> 36:45.420
Because, if you get me inside,
then I know where the money moves.

36:45.520 --> 36:48.370
I know the security routines.
I know their signals to each other.

36:48.440 --> 36:51.280
I know how they operate.
You get me in there,

36:51.350 --> 36:55.260
then I can work with this map,
and I can tell you if anything's changed.

36:55.350 --> 36:57.490
Wrong, convict.

36:57.590 --> 36:59.990
You walk in there,
they recognize you.

37:00.090 --> 37:02.230
So what ?

37:02.320 --> 37:05.150
If they recognize him, they'll
remember him when the job goes down.

37:05.200 --> 37:07.770
- They won't recognize me. Trust me.
- Why not ?

37:09.300 --> 37:13.170
'Cause you're gonna get me
a disguise.

37:13.400 --> 37:16.440
What happened to working together?

37:16.530 --> 37:20.850
- Your at herbeback in the Mountain ?
- Might as well be.

37:20.950 --> 37:25.020
Don't get 50 channels
in the Mountain. Sleep well.

37:25.120 --> 37:28.250
Tomorrow you got singin'
for your supper to do.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.750
Help yourself.

37:34.840 --> 37:37.720
Sure, take that.
I don't need it.

37:50.400 --> 37:53.280
Nick. Nick.

37:53.370 --> 37:55.290
Let me help you.

37:55.390 --> 37:58.270
- Get your own room, Ashley. Get your own room.
- Let me help you.

37:58.370 --> 38:00.700
He said when you come out,
he wants to talk to you. That's all !

38:00.770 --> 38:02.970
I thought he meant after
New Years, back in Detroit.

38:03.070 --> 38:06.240
- But you knew what he wanted. Right ?
- I thought we had more days.

38:06.330 --> 38:08.900
For what ? What are you gonna do ?
Talk me into helping ?

38:08.990 --> 38:11.360
You know how I feel about my brother !
You know how I hate him.

38:11.450 --> 38:15.710
What did you think's gonna happen ?
This thing's gonna be over and he's gonna let me go ?

38:15.810 --> 38:18.430
He's gonna shoot me
in the back of the head like this !

38:18.530 --> 38:22.010
Or I'm back in prison for the rest
of my life, and that's it for me !

38:22.110 --> 38:25.600
This is my life too, you know.
You think he's just gonna let me walk ?

38:25.700 --> 38:29.120
You think he's not gonna
take this out on me ?

38:29.210 --> 38:32.070
I'm in this too,
and I'm really scared.

38:32.130 --> 38:38.560
Please ! Nick.

38:40.610 --> 38:45.030
Do you remember all
those letters you wrote me ?

38:45.120 --> 38:48.510
About me and you
against the whole world ?

38:53.640 --> 38:55.490
God !

38:55.560 --> 38:59.810
You know, it's just my luck.

38:59.880 --> 39:04.350
I finally meet a boy that I'm crazy about,
and my brother wants him worse than I do.

39:04.450 --> 39:06.270
Why didn't you tell me
your brother was a criminal ?

39:06.340 --> 39:10.310
Gabriel knows some guys
in Miami and New York.

39:10.400 --> 39:13.030
Guys that he helps
get guns to Detroit.

39:13.130 --> 39:16.010
- That's it. That's all I know.
- And that's who he's working for on this one ?

39:16.110 --> 39:18.950
No. He doesn't
wanna work for anyone.

39:19.040 --> 39:22.120
- What's the last place they took down ?
- What ?

39:22.210 --> 39:25.670
Monster and his merry men.
What's the last place they robbed ?

39:25.760 --> 39:27.690
Who they ripped off ?
What did they do ?

39:30.410 --> 39:34.640
I don't think they've robbed anywhere
before. They just... They drive guns !

39:35.690 --> 39:37.860
They've never done a robber ?

39:42.370 --> 39:44.430
Really ?

39:44.530 --> 39:47.020
They really do need me.

39:47.120 --> 39:50.190
They actually need me.

39:58.410 --> 40:01.290
A cowboy.

40:01.390 --> 40:06.640
You're sending me into an lndian casino
dressed like a cowboy.

40:06.730 --> 40:09.200
- Thought this through entirely ?
- It was that or a ballerina.

40:09.300 --> 40:14.250
Well, I mean, I'm gonna need
some money. It is a casino.

40:18.930 --> 40:22.740
- Ten bucks ? What am I gonna do with ten bucks ?
- Don't tip.

40:22.830 --> 40:25.100
Look, if we're
gonna be workin' together,

40:25.200 --> 40:27.920
you shouldn't send me in there like the
Lone Ranger with ten bucks to throw down.

40:28.020 --> 40:32.720
You want me to not get noticed. Not
gettin' noticed costs at least a couple hundred.

40:32.780 --> 40:35.470
Ante up, boys.

41:08.980 --> 41:10.840
Don't lose.

41:10.900 --> 41:15.290
Yeah. Do I get, like, a countr-western
name, or are we just gonna...

41:15.380 --> 41:19.440
You get recognized, you get
a countr-western funeral !

41:19.540 --> 41:21.880
Come on. Come on.

41:21.940 --> 41:24.670
Get your hands off me !

41:26.590 --> 41:29.470
Are you ready
to go gamblin', darlin' ?

41:29.560 --> 41:33.080
Here. She is now.

41:33.170 --> 41:36.500
All right. You all keep an eye
on my guitar now.

41:45.020 --> 41:46.900
Jumpy.

41:53.880 --> 41:57.020
Nick, you're making it
really hard to apologize.

41:57.080 --> 41:59.520
Is that what you're trin' to do ?
Say it with car keys.

41:59.580 --> 42:02.400
Nick, a lot of relationships start out
like this, you know, family problems ?

42:02.460 --> 42:05.210
Save it, Bam-Bam.

42:07.010 --> 42:09.560
You wanna know the problem
with the Tomahawk Casino ?

42:09.630 --> 42:13.630
You wanna know the one thing
holding us back from greatness ?

42:13.690 --> 42:17.720
Snow. S-N-O-fucking-W.
Snow.

42:17.790 --> 42:20.990
There is no snow in Las Vegas, okay ?

42:21.050 --> 42:23.000
They don't want it.
They don't need it.

42:23.070 --> 42:25.790
As a matter of fact,
I think they have laws against the shit.

42:25.850 --> 42:31.450
You guys hired me because you wanted
Las Vegas quality. I brought it to you.

42:31.520 --> 42:34.780
You wanted Las Vegas press.
I gave that to you.

42:34.850 --> 42:37.350
But I cannot give you
Las Vegas profits...

42:37.400 --> 42:40.670
until you people get together
around a campfire, smoke a pipe,

42:40.740 --> 42:44.510
and do some kind of spirit dance
about this goddamn snow !

42:44.580 --> 42:48.130
They did a lot of work. This restaurant
here is the main expansion.

42:48.200 --> 42:51.110
And, they moved the games around.

42:57.860 --> 43:00.130
Do you know that guy ?

43:00.200 --> 43:03.300
Yeah, that's... that's Mike.

43:03.370 --> 43:06.980
Mike. He works here.

43:07.040 --> 43:10.310
Spend some of your brother's money.
I'm gonna go look around.

43:11.910 --> 43:14.850
I was just thinkin', maybe you fellas
would like to stick around,

43:14.920 --> 43:18.820
try the $ 5.99 prime rib.

43:32.230 --> 43:34.440
A couple of rum and cokes, please.

43:34.500 --> 43:38.120
Barry, gimme a bottle
of any goddamn thing ya got. Hurry up.

43:38.180 --> 43:41.990
Cheap two dollar fuckin' bettors.

43:42.060 --> 43:46.730
Hey, how ya doin', cowboy ?
How are ya ?

43:46.790 --> 43:49.130
- Great.
- Jack Bangs is the name. I run the place.

43:51.530 --> 43:53.450
Let me ask you something.

43:53.510 --> 43:57.000
How'd you hear about us ?
Radio ? TV ? Cable ?

43:57.070 --> 44:00.740
Prison. Prison.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.590
I can't go back to Vegas.

44:19.340 --> 44:21.520
We won! We won!

44:23.020 --> 44:25.580
What the hell
was that all about ?

44:25.650 --> 44:28.460
Nothing, man. He just wanted to know
how I heard about the place.

44:28.530 --> 44:31.340
Just fuckin' tone down a little bit,
all right ? Ease up off me.

44:32.620 --> 44:34.890
Oh, my God !
I'm sorry.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.810
Jesus Christ.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.860
I'm sorry. Here, hold this.

44:38.930 --> 44:40.780
What are you doing ?

44:40.850 --> 44:45.070
Security's not all that changed.
Let me go clean this up.

44:45.140 --> 44:48.080
- What was that ?
- His face fell off. Take this.

45:06.650 --> 45:08.760
Hey, a hundred bucks
to wear this jacket.

45:08.820 --> 45:11.790
- Jesus, don't kill me !
- Relax, kid, nobody's gonna kill you.

45:11.860 --> 45:13.850
Santa's gonna give you a hundred bucks
and a wild west jacket.

45:16.880 --> 45:20.720
Hey, baby.
Gimme one of those.

45:24.920 --> 45:27.580
- How're you ?
- Fuckin' freezing.

45:29.720 --> 45:31.760
How long you work here ?

45:31.830 --> 45:34.130
Five years, since it opened.

45:34.200 --> 45:37.010
- How long since your makeover ?
- My what ?

45:37.080 --> 45:40.600
I'm talkin' about the place. The
remodeling, moving everthing around.

45:40.660 --> 45:45.200
The Tomahawk's been the same ever since I started,
buddy. It's the losers that change.

45:47.740 --> 45:50.070
Lyin' motherfucker !

45:53.310 --> 45:55.160
Go, kid, go !

46:01.950 --> 46:03.800
Hey !

46:05.120 --> 46:06.680
Shit !

46:27.350 --> 46:31.960
- It's your jacket, you can have it !
He gave me a hundred bucks. - Shit !

46:39.130 --> 46:42.240
- What the hell happened, man ?
- The man fucked up !

46:42.300 --> 46:45.860
This building is the same from day one !
It hasn't been changed !

46:45.920 --> 46:49.860
Monster, he was talkin' to the manager
inside there. There he is !

46:54.660 --> 46:57.020
Go, go, go, go !

46:57.090 --> 46:59.130
Come on !
Get him back !

47:19.200 --> 47:22.530
Keep on running, Romeo !
Keep on running !

47:22.600 --> 47:25.860
As fast as you go,
we'll get there !

47:25.920 --> 47:29.730
- We're truckers, motherfucker!
We drive for a living !

47:52.780 --> 47:55.720
Help ! Help !

47:55.780 --> 47:58.990
He thinks he's gettin' away.

48:00.770 --> 48:02.920
Oh, shit !

48:18.630 --> 48:21.480
No !

48:36.590 --> 48:38.740
Come on. Come on!

48:54.730 --> 48:57.870
We gotta get to those trees.

49:07.920 --> 49:10.710
Oh, shit !

49:47.290 --> 49:50.900
C'mon ! Get 'em outta there !
C'mon !

49:50.970 --> 49:53.300
- Is she all right ?
- All right, all right !

49:53.370 --> 49:58.140
At the rate you're goin', I'm gonna
have trouble considerin' you family.

49:58.200 --> 50:01.620
Hey, there !
You folks need some help ?

50:06.040 --> 50:09.180
- I say, you need some help ?
- Get outta here, man !

50:09.240 --> 50:12.540
- Shut the fuck up !
- Get the fuck outta here !

50:12.600 --> 50:16.600
Well, if you need
some help...

50:19.220 --> 50:21.090
Gabriel, no!

50:21.140 --> 50:24.980
Gabriel, he won't hurt us.
He won't remember us. Don't do it.

50:25.050 --> 50:26.900
Shut the fuck up !

50:29.210 --> 50:30.690
No !

50:32.990 --> 50:36.190
Oh, God !

50:46.780 --> 50:49.950
What's this ? What's this ?
This isn't the Tomahawk. No.

50:50.010 --> 50:51.870
No, I've never seen this before.

50:51.930 --> 50:54.310
They must have given the place
a makeover. Yeah !

50:54.360 --> 50:58.150
The buffet was over here, the blackjack was over here,
the bar used to be over here.

50:58.200 --> 51:00.190
I don't know. I can't help you.
I have no idea.

51:00.260 --> 51:02.370
I have no idea !

51:02.430 --> 51:05.570
Somethin' tells me you're not
being totally honest with me.

51:05.630 --> 51:07.490
What'd you tell
that casino manager ?

51:07.550 --> 51:11.300
- Nothin'. Nothin'.
- You was talking to him. What'd you tell him ?

51:11.360 --> 51:13.370
Nothin'.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.330
He thought I was some gambler.
Nothin' I said.

51:15.430 --> 51:17.350
Maybe something about a robbery ?

51:17.440 --> 51:19.490
No, man, I swear to...
I swear to God.

51:22.920 --> 51:26.690
Jesus Christ, man !
He thought I was some gambler !

51:26.760 --> 51:29.930
He didn't know me, man !

51:29.980 --> 51:32.830
He didn't recognize me ! Jesus Christ !

51:32.930 --> 51:36.220
I've been drivin' rigs
a long time, convict.

51:36.320 --> 51:40.300
Four, five million miles of road.
Hard road.

51:40.350 --> 51:43.660
Tell 'em I was tired, shit,
they'd just hire someone else.

51:43.710 --> 51:47.910
A thousand miles by sundown
or the gang don't eat come sunrise.

51:47.980 --> 51:50.530
Shit.

51:50.600 --> 51:54.020
And ever road, ever mile,

51:54.080 --> 51:59.430
it's nothin' but moms and pops and
car-seat kiddies giving me that look...

51:59.500 --> 52:03.270
- to go to hell and get off
their happy goddamn highway.

52:03.340 --> 52:07.500
So I have worked...

52:07.560 --> 52:10.150
and I have slaved,

52:10.210 --> 52:14.190
and I have waited...
for the highways to split open...

52:14.240 --> 52:17.890
and for the rivers to roil
and for God in the heavens...

52:17.960 --> 52:22.250
to reach down and show me
some sign of my reward,

52:22.350 --> 52:25.420
to grant me with my gift
and say to me,

52:25.480 --> 52:31.140
"Gabriel, my son,
you are done with the road."

52:33.710 --> 52:35.940
Well, convict,

52:36.970 --> 52:38.960
that gift was granted.

52:39.020 --> 52:41.260
Look, man, I swear to God,

52:41.320 --> 52:43.690
he just wanted to know how I heard
about the place, that's all.

52:43.760 --> 52:47.850
He didn't know it was me, Gabriel.
He didn't know it was me ! Please !

52:49.040 --> 52:51.540
Man, Monster, just don't
start tring to hit me.

52:54.830 --> 52:58.640
Nick, I've been tring
to hit you.

53:02.920 --> 53:07.690
Because I do not deserve
to be in some shit-bag motel...

53:07.790 --> 53:10.290
in the middle
of bum-fuck Michigan,

53:10.350 --> 53:12.620
throwing darts at a worthless...

53:12.690 --> 53:15.210
convict!

53:23.600 --> 53:26.640
You know somethin' ?

53:26.710 --> 53:29.300
My little sister...

53:29.360 --> 53:31.960
she deserves
a world better than you.

53:34.890 --> 53:37.200
Tonight we're gonna take
one more look at that map,

53:37.270 --> 53:42.000
and this time, you better have
somethin' worth saying.

53:44.340 --> 53:45.910
What did they do to you, Nick ?

53:45.970 --> 53:48.340
He had some... points to make.

53:48.400 --> 53:50.450
What the fuck did you do to him ?

53:52.500 --> 53:55.190
Bastard.
Get out ! Get out !

53:55.250 --> 53:57.110
Just get out !

53:57.170 --> 54:00.180
Okay. Come here.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.100
Jesus.

54:02.160 --> 54:04.050
There you go. Okay.

54:05.970 --> 54:08.660
All I wanted to do was to
make it back to Sidnaw...

54:08.730 --> 54:10.870
and have some of
Mom's gravy, you know,

54:10.940 --> 54:13.300
and some of Aunt Elizabeth's
cranberry cakes.

54:13.370 --> 54:16.990
She makes 'em with, real cranberries.

54:17.040 --> 54:19.610
It's... really good.

54:19.670 --> 54:21.600
- We'll get there, baby.
- Jesus.

54:21.690 --> 54:24.760
We'll get there.

54:24.820 --> 54:27.160
Just rest, okay ?

54:32.570 --> 54:34.900
You saved my life, Nick.

54:37.150 --> 54:39.740
You could've run, but you didn't.

54:39.800 --> 54:42.200
- You saved me.
- You saved me.

54:42.300 --> 54:45.370
I saved you because
I love you, Nick.

54:46.810 --> 54:48.670
Why did you save me ?

54:51.320 --> 54:55.830
The guy I was in with...
Rudy, the car thief...

54:56.860 --> 54:59.930
sometimes I read him your letters.

55:00.000 --> 55:03.010
I mean, I know
they were private, but,

55:03.070 --> 55:04.930
you know,

55:06.750 --> 55:10.520
I'd read 'em to him,
and he'd get this look on his face.

55:11.870 --> 55:15.750
I swear, I think he imagined
you were writing to him.

55:15.840 --> 55:18.370
And I know sometimes,

55:18.430 --> 55:20.580
I think,

55:20.640 --> 55:23.620
he fell in love with you too.

55:24.730 --> 55:27.560
You gave a couple of guys hope, Ashley.

55:28.740 --> 55:31.360
Hope is a good thing.

55:31.420 --> 55:34.720
We're gonna get out of this... together.

55:34.790 --> 55:37.570
I promise you. I promise you.

56:01.640 --> 56:04.230
Start singing, Nick.

56:04.290 --> 56:07.360
I have no gifts to bring...

56:07.430 --> 56:12.010
A gift to give a King...

56:25.100 --> 56:27.270
It's a joke, anyways.

56:29.640 --> 56:32.780
All right.

56:32.840 --> 56:35.690
What you wanna do,

56:37.290 --> 56:39.140
is get to the top level
up here.

56:39.210 --> 56:42.980
Okay ? And you do that through
this door on the western wall.

56:45.380 --> 56:47.250
When you...

56:47.300 --> 56:49.290
You wanna get to the security,

56:49.360 --> 56:51.470
and then from the security
you get down to the cashier cage,

56:51.530 --> 56:53.390
and then you go
into the count room.

56:53.450 --> 56:56.110
There'll be a guard in there,
but he doesn't have a gun.

56:56.170 --> 56:58.440
The door's accessed
by a keypad.

56:58.510 --> 57:02.180
- The cashier'll know the code.
- What about the pow-wow safe ?

57:02.250 --> 57:04.820
That's upstairs !
You'll wanna get to that.

57:04.870 --> 57:06.890
We're gonna get
to the pow-wow safe.

57:06.960 --> 57:09.100
That's good.
We're gonna get there.

57:09.160 --> 57:11.820
What you wanna do is,
you got to get a guy in the cage...

57:11.880 --> 57:14.350
and a guy on the foor
and somebody up top.

57:14.420 --> 57:16.530
Then you need a sweeper
on the side,

57:16.590 --> 57:20.690
look out out front
and somebody watching the back.

57:20.750 --> 57:22.870
So that's... how many ?
That's six.

57:22.920 --> 57:24.910
Well, we got five.

57:24.980 --> 57:27.020
We're keeping Ashley outside.

57:28.050 --> 57:30.290
And you need six.

57:30.350 --> 57:32.210
No.

57:33.620 --> 57:36.530
I... Look, man, I'm not
making this shit up, you know ?

57:36.600 --> 57:40.370
You go in there with five guys, you're gonna
either leave an exit or an alarm unguarded.

57:40.440 --> 57:43.320
- No.
- I know what I'm talking about.

57:43.370 --> 57:45.750
Raise your hand if you've
ever done a robber before.

57:47.310 --> 57:49.330
Anyone ? Anyone ?
Who's done... done a robbery,

57:49.390 --> 57:51.250
raise your hand.

57:51.310 --> 57:54.170
Okay. I have.

57:58.130 --> 57:59.980
You need six, Gabriel.

58:00.050 --> 58:03.250
You do. What are you
gonna do about it ?

58:08.720 --> 58:14.260
All right. I want a drawing
of that security level.

58:14.330 --> 58:17.330
Ever door, ever guard,
ever ashtray.

58:18.490 --> 58:20.340
Yeah. All right.

58:20.410 --> 58:22.390
So, six guys,
that's six guns.

58:22.450 --> 58:25.750
No way.

58:25.810 --> 58:28.470
Well, what am I gonna do ?
I'm no threat without a gun.

58:28.540 --> 58:33.400
- No, you're not.
- What's the matter, Gabriel ?

58:35.410 --> 58:37.910
Isn't this what
you wanted him for ?

58:37.980 --> 58:41.600
- Areas of expertise ?
- No guns.

58:41.650 --> 58:43.520
Well, you know, fine.
It's up to you.

58:43.570 --> 58:46.970
What you've got to figure out is how you're
gonna get up to that security level...

58:47.030 --> 58:48.890
without anybody knowing
anything's wrong.

58:48.950 --> 58:51.800
I can tell you right now, going
in there with A.K.s and ski masks...

58:51.870 --> 58:55.640
ain't gonna do that.

58:55.710 --> 58:58.210
Well, that part, Nick,

58:58.260 --> 59:00.860
was planned out the day
I read your letters.

59:00.920 --> 59:04.250
Oh, yeah. What ? We're all gonna
dress up like cowboys ?

59:04.310 --> 59:06.850
No, no, not cowboys, Nick.

59:06.900 --> 59:09.020
Not on Christmas Eve.

59:18.140 --> 59:20.320
You gotta be kidding me.

59:21.820 --> 59:23.680
'Tis the season, convict.

59:26.650 --> 59:27.930
Coming up at 11:00...

59:28.000 --> 59:29.990
on the channel five news,
these top stories.

59:30.040 --> 59:33.440
- The search intensifies for a Michiganman...
- Here's your Picasso.

59:33.500 --> 59:35.460
reported missing this morning
on the Tallahassee Lake.

59:35.520 --> 59:38.370
- Investigators suspect foul play to be involved.
- It better be.

59:38.430 --> 59:40.290
Also, lotter fever...

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:22.340
How long have you guys
been going out ?

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:29.670
- Set us up with free drinks.
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:09.610
Shit !

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.910
Only guy in the gun club
who doesn't keep a gun in his truck.

01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:20.750
Shit!

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:23.310
Fucker decided
to build him a silicone tongue...

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.230
so that the boy could talk.

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:28.400
Now, you ever see a motherfucker with
a breast-implanted tongue ?

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:32.400
This guy I'm talking about... black-ass
lung is the least of his problems, man.

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.500
He had so much smoke
comin' out of his skin,

01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:40.480
- people would say, "Hey, where's
the barbecue ?" - Yeah.

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:48.680
No! No!

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:52.370
No! Getaway from me, goddamnit!

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.950
Stay the hell away from me.
You want me to scream ?

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.870
I'll fucking scream,
I swear to God.

01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:01.430
- Listen, I was just trying to stop him.
- You just about killed me !

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:04.810
When I saw you fall, I could have put
the gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.410
I swear to God, you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:11.790
I know that you
have tobe with him,

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.720
but it is killing me.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.750
Gabriel, we just have to
keep doing this, and...

01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:20.270
He's helped us do the map.

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:22.550
He's done what we need.

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.470
We don't need him anymore.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.390
No !

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:29.720
Jesus !

01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:34.390
You drive me crazy,
you know that ?

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:36.570
- Hey...
- No!

01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:40.670
You listen to me, because
we have to be smart about this.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.310
The more he wants me,
the more his help's for real.

01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:46.620
He's manpower.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.910
- That's all he is.
- He wants the money.

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.830
No, baby.

01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:57.880
He wants me.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.980
Your little sister.

01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:08.630
If only Ma and Pop...

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:11.030
Could see us now.

01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:17.850
lf only this guy would
play the game by the numbers.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.880
From where I stand, the only thing
he's been doing right so far...

01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:24.310
is fucking my girlfriend.

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.270
Baby.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.110
- He's nothing. Nothing.
- See you later, assholes.

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:32.030
- Who's Jumpy calling ? Which one ?
- Ex-wife, probably.

01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:35.070
All the ex-wives he's got, he's probably
gonna have to take down three casinos.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:39.420
- You track down Gabriel ? - Nah, he's with his
girlfriend, making up for lost "Nicky" time.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.760
Come on. Let's go get a drink.

01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:44.090
No, l should go and check on Romeo.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.970
Go smile on
the motherfucker in love.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.890
Shit !

01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:54.820
You know what ?
I'll meet you in the bar.

01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:25.510
Fuck !

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:53.700
Come on.

01:04:56.770 --> 01:04:58.630
Come on.
Give me something.

01:04:58.690 --> 01:05:01.570
I can hot-wire cars. I should
fuckin' hot-wire a hotel room.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.510
Damn.

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:15.110
Who's slamming doors ?

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:36.780
How ya doin' ?

01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:55.280
And your... your charges, sir.

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.230
Happy holidays.

01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:10.160
That's for the hundred bucks'
worth of pay-per-view.

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.960
That's for the two hundred
you took out of the mini bar.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.330
- That's enough !
- It was on my credit card !

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:19.760
I figured since you guys
were paying for the room...

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:26.030
So, you wanted a weapon, convict ?

01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:31.990
Don't ! Don't !

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:39.570
Well, now, look at what
Santa's dwarves have brought you.

01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:42.640
What do you say to Santa's dwarves ?

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.730
Elves. Santa's elves.

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:47.830
You say, "Thank you," motherfucker.

01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:54.930
You hang around with criminals,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.920
you end up making
a lot of plans.

01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:00.150
But all the jobs I ever pulled,

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:05.140
all the cars I ever stole, no plan ever
went down the way it had been drawn up.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.610
My plans to escape never worked.

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:11.960
And being on parole,
going to the police wasn't an option.

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:14.840
What's the matter ?
You nervous ?

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.160
Right now you're
just a truck driver.

01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:21.690
You haven't done
anything wrong yet.

01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:25.560
If you do this, you're gonna spend the
rest of your life wishing you hadn't.

01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:28.150
Thanks for the reminder, Nick.

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:31.350
Relax. Have a drink.

01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:37.300
Ain't that your thing ?

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:57.990
Hey, hey! Thirsty!

01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:02.500
This diversion you're doing...

01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:05.120
you'd better do it
just the way Monster planned.

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:08.640
Or there ain't gonna be
no more rest of your life.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:25.830
- And all through the house,
not a creature was stirring.

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:33.130
Why don't you send
most of your boys home, Ed.

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:35.840
Tom, why don't you go spend Christmas
with your family.

01:08:35.939 --> 01:08:39.040
Don, you can shove off.
Merry Christmas, Jack.

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.550
Nobody even comes here
to cheat.

01:08:43.649 --> 01:08:47.430
Hello !

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:50.080
Eggnog for everyone !
Santa's here !

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:53.120
Good to see you. Merry Christmas !
Merry Christmas !

01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:56.710
We'd like some money, please.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.560
We're here to win money.
Do you have any money ?

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.479
How are you gentlemen
doing tonight ?

01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:03.430
Ver good, captain,
except that we're out of work.

01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:06.350
Season's greetings.
He's from Lindstrom's.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:08.550
I'm from Saveaway.
How ya doin' ?

01:09:08.649 --> 01:09:11.880
No more toys for the kiddies,
but we do have charitable donations.

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:19.310
All right. All in ?

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.310
Hey, sweetheart,
how ya doin' ?

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.260
- I'm fuckin' freezin'. What can I get you ?
- Twenty-one.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:28.100
- Oh, Jesus ! You just hit for my card !
- I'm not sorry, mister.

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:31.270
- Dealerhas 18.
- And look at that, grandpa.

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.380
Yeah, I'm gonna win your sled.

01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:36.490
- Save away !
- Over here. I saved you a seat.

01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:38.920
- Play my hand.
- Lindstrom's, how ya doin' ?

01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:40.840
Aren't you gonna
take those beards off ?

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:43.500
No, I'm not gonna take this beard off.
It's my lucky beard.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.189
Mind my beard. Watch out for this guy.
He's a fucking jinx.

01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:48.910
Okay, Santa number three,
what can I get you ?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.790
Could fat man with fying horse
get quarters, please ?

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.950
- Watch my bank.
- All right.

01:09:56.010 --> 01:09:58.060
Five. Nine.

01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:01.550
No wa... Pop, you're... Damn it,
you're hitting for my card. No.

01:10:01.650 --> 01:10:03.500
- You don't even know what it is.
- He doesn't hit.

01:10:03.570 --> 01:10:05.520
Why don't you go find a chimney
somewhere and fall in?

01:10:05.610 --> 01:10:09.620
Son of a bitch !
You are killing me here !

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:11.250
That's the way it goes.

01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:13.460
There's two more coming.

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:17.450
There you go. That's what l like to see.
Now that's the spirit.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.170
- Jack, is there a union for department store Santas ?
- Hey, who the fuck knows ?

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.950
Get... Go... Get another table
for old people !

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.420
You're taking Santa's money !

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:29.780
- There is no other table.
- Then open another table !

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.020
What kind of a people
cheats Santa Claus ?

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.940
- What the hell are you doing ?
- For God's sakes !

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.940
- That was Santa's money! You took it!
- Security !

01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:39.290
- Hey ! Come here, buddy !
- You cheated !

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:42.070
Lay down, pop. It's all right.

01:10:42.130 --> 01:10:45.430
Santa Claus is kicking the shit
out of your guards.

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.650
Security room. Downstairs.

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.800
Right, right. Take a right.
Security room.

01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:01.680
Fuck.

01:11:04.690 --> 01:11:06.550
Fuckin' convict ! Jesus !

01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:11.190
Turn off the fucking alarm !

01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:14.100
Drop 'em ! Put the guns down !

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:16.470
Put the guns down !
Put 'em down !

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.750
Get away from that alarm !

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.460
Put 'em down, fucking right now !

01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:24.320
Now, now, now ! Drop 'em !

01:11:24.370 --> 01:11:26.170
Get down !

01:11:29.170 --> 01:11:31.450
Don't !

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:34.170
Your piss is all you need, Romeo.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.820
- Move, goddamn you !
- Come on ! These guys aren't fucking around !

01:11:41.890 --> 01:11:45.020
Let's go ! Get in there !

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:48.470
All right. Just...
Just do what my friends say.

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:51.420
They're a little bit, disturbed.

01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:07.100
What's the security code
for the count room ?

01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:09.090
You just use... use a key.

01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:11.420
- Nick said code !
- Who the fuck is Nick ? Who's Nick ?

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:31.910
Drop your gun !

01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:34.170
All right, all right, all right !

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:37.700
You motherfucker !
No guns in the count room !

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.310
Fuck you !

01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:49.030
- No guns in the count room !
- Forget about him and get the money !

01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:52.260
Forget about him
and get the fucking money!

01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:58.150
Forget about him.

01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:01.220
There's no future for people
like you and me, Nick.

01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:06.180
The places we come from...
plant towns, mill towns, small lives !

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.120
No future, just more of the same !

01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:11.590
You want a future,
you gotta stand up and steal it.

01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:24.140
Oh, my God !

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.500
Oh, my God.

01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:29.380
Oh, my God.

01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:35.370
The pow-wow safe ! I want
the pow-wow safe ! Where is it ?

01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:37.870
I can't go back...
I can't go back to Las Vegas.

01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.760
Fuck !

01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:46.470
I do not give a shit about Vegas !

01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:48.550
The money is in the car.

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:51.270
- Let's get out of here right now.
- He won't tell us where it is.

01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:53.810
- What ?
- The pow-wow safe.

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.910
Remember Nick Cassidy ?
A security guard named Nick Cassidy ?

01:13:56.970 --> 01:14:00.170
Yeah, Nick Cassidy. Nick.
Where is he ?

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.050
Gabriel, we have enough money.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.970
Where is he ?

01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:11.380
That's not Nick Cassidy.

01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:15.050
Nick Cassidy worked for me
two years ago.

01:14:19.690 --> 01:14:22.670
Cowboy. Hope along.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.320
Fuck !

01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:29.390
It's the stor of your life, Ash.

01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:31.920
You fucked the wrong guy !

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:37.680
Rudy Duncan, honey. Are we still
gonna spend Christmas together ?

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:40.240
- You fucking bastard !
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.290
No, goddamn it !

01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:44.820
You are lucky, convict.

01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:50.130
You're gonna be spending Christmas
with the birthday boy Himself.

01:14:50.190 --> 01:14:52.570
Wait a minute.
There is a pow-wow safe. All right ?

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:54.900
There is a pow-wow safe.
I did time with Nick Cassidy.

01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:56.820
Some shit he told me,
some shit I remember.

01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:59.380
He told me the manager keeps
a secret stash in his office.

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.300
- A pow-wow safe.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.050
- No, there is no safe ! He's stalling us !
- He told me ! He said it !

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.610
- There is no safe !
- I over heard it!

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:09.970
- He's been stalling us from day one. There's no safe.
- There's a pow-wow safe !

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.920
- I heard it!
- Then where the fuck is it ?

01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:14.460
Behind the liquor cabinet.

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:21.750
Oh, Jesus !

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.810
- Hey, hey !
- Oh, please.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.730
- Get up. Get up. Open it.
- Oh, please, sir.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.610
- I can't go back to Vegas. I can't go...
- I don't give a fuck about that !

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.530
Get up ! Open it !

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.160
Hurry up !

01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:07.420
Pow-wow.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.790
Pow-wow.

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.060
Hey, Santa Claus !

01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:30.980
Welcome to the Tomahawk !

01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:41.690
Oh, shit !

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:03.100
Get up.

01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:18.150
Yeah. God... is good.

01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:23.430
Now, what do you say...

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.350
to Santa's dwarves ?

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:30.950
You say, "Thank you."

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.230
Never make
the same mistake twice.

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:48.330
You just did.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.740
I picked the wrong guy.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:13.300
We took the place down
with the wrong guy !

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:16.240
Is this Christmas ?

01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:18.420
Is this Christmas ?

01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:23.640
God bless us, everyone.

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:02.450
Come on.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.290
Smart, aren't you ?
So smart.

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.600
You're smarter than everbody ?

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:12.090
Pow-wow safe. A little gift for us
in the pow-wow safe.

01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:17.110
Well, I've got a gift for you from Pug
and Merlin and Jumpy, you son of a bitch.

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.680
You're going where they went,
and they're gonna find you there,

01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:22.140
and they're gonna kick
your fucking ass !

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.380
You feel smart ?
You think you're lucky ?

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.620
Well, let's see how lucky you are.

01:20:26.690 --> 01:20:29.880
Come on !
Here's how lucky you are.

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:33.150
You got out of the Tomahawk,
into your car,

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:36.990
made it half way to Canada
until you caught some ice in the road.

01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:44.260
Get down there !

01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:46.810
Take a look !

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:50.790
By the time you hit the bottom down there,
the whole car was burning like a comet.

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.960
Must have burned up
all that money too.

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.250
Was it your idea, Monster ?
Or was it hers ?

01:20:57.310 --> 01:21:01.760
Well, she told me about
the convict magazines.

01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:05.600
Had to figure there'd be some guys
in the pen with some useful knowledge...

01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:09.800
with nobody to talk to
and nobody to listen.

01:21:09.850 --> 01:21:13.730
So, we just stocked up
on stationer.

01:21:15.490 --> 01:21:18.850
It's a hard life
being a trucker's girl.

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:21.730
Aw, baby.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.650
Come here.

01:21:30.150 --> 01:21:32.580
- I saved your life.
- You shouldn't have.

01:21:32.650 --> 01:21:34.660
He really loved you,
you know that ?

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.050
Nick. He really loved you.

01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:45.190
Who wouldn't ?

01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:50.310
Maybe this is where
you wanted him, Ashley.

01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:53.510
Some stranger at the bottom
of a ravine with a burned-up heart.

01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:56.490
Maybe.
But it didn't happen.

01:21:56.550 --> 01:22:00.260
- 'Cause what you did for him - you made
him the happiest he'd ever been. - Shut up.

01:22:00.330 --> 01:22:02.220
Get up. Come on.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:05.160
- Get in the car !
- Get in the car !

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:08.270
Hey. Hey ! Gabriel !

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.830
Don't go getting
all noble with me, Rudy.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.830
A guy takes a shiv for you,
you go chasing his girlfriend ?

01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:22.530
- Don't talk to me about greed !
- What ? What did you say ?

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:25.610
I said, "Don't talk to me about greed !"

01:22:25.670 --> 01:22:29.130
No, not about that. About...
You said, "A guy takes a shiv for you."

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.400
I never said anything about a shiv.
How'd you know there was a shiv ?

01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.540
You said it. You said
the real Nick died saving you.

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:37.390
No, I didn't.
I said he died.

01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:39.790
- I never said how.
- Yes, you did.

01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:42.960
No. I never said how.
I said he died.

01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:45.710
- You said he was stabbed.
- I said he died.

01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:47.690
I never said how.

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:50.420
You said he was stabbed...
that he took a shiv,

01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:52.650
a knife, a shank, whatever.

01:22:55.890 --> 01:22:58.640
- Ash ?
- How'd she know it was a shiv ?

01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:02.380
Ash ?

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.740
How'd she know ?

01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:15.310
Jesus Christ.

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:17.230
Men !

01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:17.430
Merry Christmas, Rudy.

01:24:31.230 --> 01:24:34.940
We made it, baby.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.240
Oh, yes, we did.

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:40.280
We made it.

01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:42.900
It got a little messy, but...

01:24:42.970 --> 01:24:45.880
I'll tell you all about that
once we're on the road.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.040
For your information,

01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:57.850
I never fuck the wrong guy.

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:03.490
So, Rudy,

01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:06.080
I want you to meet Millie Bobeck.

01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:08.000
Remember Millie Bobeck, don't you ?

01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:10.880
My girlfriend before I went in.

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:15.490
Worked in that bar in Motor City
where I manslaughtered What's-His-Name.

01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:19.620
See, Millie here,

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:22.690
she used to serve drinks
to these gunrunning truckers.

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:25.280
Real big talkers,

01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:28.070
scheming about a real score one day.

01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:30.880
Two years in the Mountain, man.
What the hell ?

01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:33.350
Why not let her get friendly
with them ?

01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:35.810
Tell them her real name
was Ashley.

01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:39.620
Tell them about this idea she had...
about writing guys in prison.

01:25:39.690 --> 01:25:43.170
Find a sucker who could
show them a sure thing.

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:45.280
You know,

01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:48.710
they would have never
done it without you, Nick.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.770
I mean, Rudy.

01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:56.350
I always wanted
to rob that casino, Rudy,

01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:58.270
way back when I worked there.

01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:01.290
What better way than to get
some guys to rob it for me ?

01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:04.420
Paid the Alamo a hundred
to put the shiv in me.

01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:07.460
He's a lifer, man.
What does he care ?

01:26:07.530 --> 01:26:10.410
He was supposed to stab me
in the yard later that day.

01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:15.560
But when the food fight started, man,
I couldn't believe it.

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:17.860
A slash across the ribs,

01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:20.490
a little homemade blood capsule...

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:23.280
gets you a nice, warm hospital bed.

01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:27.460
Paid a guard to spread
the word I'd bought it.

01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:33.030
And once the wound healed up,
got out of the Mountain this morning.

01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:37.830
Tonight, I'm arich man.

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.710
Get in the car.

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:48.620
Keep your gun on him, honey.

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:52.400
How'd you know I'd do it ?

01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:57.070
Because every time
I read her letters, Rudy,

01:26:57.130 --> 01:26:59.050
you listened.

01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:03.790
Besides, man,
if you hadn't taken the bait,

01:27:03.850 --> 01:27:06.480
we'd have still had a shot.

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:09.680
She'd have just had to convince 'em
they could do it alone.

01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:12.750
But what do you know ?
Good ol' Rudy came through.

01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:14.740
Good old predictable Rudy.

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:18.900
Goes for the easymoney...
every time.

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:22.710
Five Santas walked into
that Tomahawk, Rudy.

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.110
That's what the witnesses will say.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:29.200
So we gotta have
five Santas not walk out.

01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:31.120
Gotta have five.

01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:34.900
How many things could have gone wrong ?
A thousand.

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:39.280
You think we don't know
what a long shot is ?

01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:41.770
My girl Millie was steering you, man.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:45.590
You fucked it up,
she would have cutandrun.

01:27:45.650 --> 01:27:48.750
They'd be looking for Ashley Mercer.

01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:52.180
Whoever she is.

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:58.100
Six months of telling you
Tomahawk stories.

01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:01.620
I guess now you know why.

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:08.660
You gave 'em the confidence
to walk in there, Nick Cassidy.

01:28:09.690 --> 01:28:11.540
That's all we needed you to do.

01:28:11.610 --> 01:28:14.230
You said some nice things
about me, man.

01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:16.690
I appreciate it.

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:21.040
You know what ?
You're right. I do love her.

01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:24.600
And she...

01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:28.500
She loves me.

01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:32.820
You had that part right all along.

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:39.480
It's Christmas, sugar plum.

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:43.190
Let's light up the tree.

01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:59.770
Shit ! Shit !

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.960
Write me.

01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:08.470
Aw, shit ! It's like riding a bike.
Like riding a bike.

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.820
Good-bye, Rudy, my man.
Nice spending...

01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:17.830
time with you !

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.970
Never put a car thief behind the wheel !

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:37.730
No ! No !

01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:04.930
Five Santas walked into that Tomahawk, Rudy.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.850
That's what the witnesses will say.

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:11.270
So we gotta have five Santas
not walk out.

01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:14.630
Gotta have five.

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.350
Rudy.

01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:35.720
Rudy, you and me, man.

01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:39.080
You and me.

01:30:39.150 --> 01:30:41.550
We can split the money?

01:30:41.610 --> 01:30:44.240
Rudy, that whore, Millie Bobeck ?

01:30:44.290 --> 01:30:46.160
You think I was serious about her, man ?

01:30:46.210 --> 01:30:48.750
I was gonna kill her.

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:51.530
You gotta believe me.

01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:53.450
You gotta believe me. I swear it.

01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:56.300
- Believe me!
- Believe this.

01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:59.500
Rudy ! Rudy, help me !

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:17.140
All I wanna do
is make it back to Sidnaw,

01:33:17.210 --> 01:33:19.610
sit down for Christmas dinner,

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:22.080
watch some ball with my oldman,

01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:24.120
sleep in my own bed,

01:33:24.190 --> 01:33:27.580
have leftovers for about six months,

01:33:27.650 --> 01:33:30.620
eat some of
that Christmas turkey.

01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:49.160
Like I said, I never was
much for the holidays...

01:33:49.210 --> 01:33:51.560
until now.
