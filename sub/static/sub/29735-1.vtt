depression and anxiety.

medicinal marijuana,

this tolerance for it.

What is all that beeping?

12:00.305 --> 12:01.928
- It's Greg.

12:01.928 --> 12:03.377
I got a track on.

12:04.551 --> 12:06.380
That's my homeboy.

12:06.380 --> 12:10.730
You know, but you never can
be too careful nowadays.

12:12.455 --> 12:14.526
[phone beeps]

12:14.526 --> 12:16.805
- Was that a tracking beep too?

12:16.805 --> 12:18.738
- Nah, it's the office.

12:32.199 --> 12:35.271
Janet [sighs].

12:35.271 --> 12:36.894
[phone beeps]

12:36.894 --> 12:38.274
[Mike sighs]

12:38.274 --> 12:40.345
- [Janet] Was that work, too?

12:40.345 --> 12:42.485
[Mike sighs]

12:42.485 --> 12:45.385
[car engines roar]

12:48.215 --> 12:50.666
- [Man] Jay, where's my fries?

12:50.666 --> 12:51.840
- Hey, I'll bring
it for you, okay?

12:51.840 --> 12:53.565
Anything else for you?

12:53.565 --> 12:55.257
- [Trina] He's so rude.

12:55.257 --> 12:56.465
I would never be that rude,

12:56.465 --> 12:58.191
you know that, right?

12:59.468 --> 13:00.676
- Sorry for the wait, ladies.

13:00.676 --> 13:03.196
- Oh, so nice of you to join us.

13:03.196 --> 13:05.543
So we gonna get some free
appetizers or something?

13:05.543 --> 13:06.855
- Sorry, but staff's
a little thin,

13:06.855 --> 13:10.617
so I'm trying to do a
million things at once.

13:14.932 --> 13:16.140
So what can I get for you?

13:16.140 --> 13:17.762
- Free appetizers.

13:17.762 --> 13:19.833
- Trina, stop.
- What?

13:19.833 --> 13:21.283
- I'll have a Knight
burger and a salad.

13:21.283 --> 13:22.594
- Okay.

13:22.594 --> 13:23.423
And to drink?

13:23.423 --> 13:24.251
- A Sprite.

13:24.251 --> 13:25.080
- Okay.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.322
And for you?

13:26.322 --> 13:28.738
- I'm gonna have the
pulled chicken dinner,

13:28.738 --> 13:30.292
also with a Sprite.

13:30.292 --> 13:31.120
- [Jay] All right.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.052
- Mm-hmm.

13:32.052 --> 13:33.329
- [Jay] Great, and for you?

13:33.329 --> 13:34.537
- I'm gonna do the
Wall Street wings.

13:34.537 --> 13:35.607
[she clears her throat]

13:35.607 --> 13:36.712
- [Jay] And to drink?

13:36.712 --> 13:38.093
- Another gin and tonic.

13:38.093 --> 13:39.197
- Okay.

13:39.197 --> 13:40.750
- [Woman] Damn, girl.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.442
- And how 'bout you, ma'am.

13:42.442 --> 13:44.133
What can I get for you?

13:44.133 --> 13:46.964
- I'll have the St.
Louis pork ribs,

13:46.964 --> 13:48.931
and an orange Fanta.

13:48.931 --> 13:51.313
- Sorry, but we're
actually out of Fanta.

13:51.313 --> 13:52.590
- What do you have?

13:52.590 --> 13:54.143
- Water and Sprite.

13:55.317 --> 13:56.490
- Just give me the Sprite.

13:56.490 --> 13:58.458
- All right, gladly.

13:58.458 --> 13:59.700
I'll have that out
for you shortly.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.150
Again, I'm sorry for the wait.

14:01.150 --> 14:03.635
- [Janet] Thank you.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.499
- Now I know something's
really wrong with him, right?

14:05.499 --> 14:07.156
[they chuckle]

14:07.156 --> 14:09.952
Anyway, girl, what
were you saying?

14:09.952 --> 14:11.195
- So on my way over here,

14:11.195 --> 14:13.507
Michael's phone was
going off nonstop.

14:13.507 --> 14:14.854
Saying that it was just work.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.234
- See, girl, I knew it.

14:16.234 --> 14:17.339
I knew it was something.

14:17.339 --> 14:19.168
- Who do you think it was?

14:19.168 --> 14:20.825
- I'm sure it was just business.

14:20.825 --> 14:21.930
You know Michael
loves you way too much

14:21.930 --> 14:23.655
to mess up your relationship.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.105
- Oh, girl, whatever.

14:25.105 --> 14:26.555
He's still a man.

14:26.555 --> 14:29.696
- Well, if he is messing around,
he's gonna be a dead man.

14:29.696 --> 14:30.973
[they laugh]

14:30.973 --> 14:32.388
- [Trina] That's what
I'm talking about.

14:32.388 --> 14:33.803
- Oh, there she goes
again, trying to instigate.

14:33.803 --> 14:36.082
- Uh-uh, but it will be fine.

14:36.082 --> 14:37.773
What's going on with
you and your man, Trina?

14:37.773 --> 14:40.258
- You know, we're
good, we're good.

14:40.258 --> 14:41.190
- So now you want
to get all quiet

14:41.190 --> 14:43.883
since she said your man?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.194
- So how's Keon?

14:46.057 --> 14:47.748
[they exclaim and chuckle]

14:47.748 --> 14:49.750
Yeah, that's what I thought.

14:49.750 --> 14:50.959
- No, seriously, Trina,

14:50.959 --> 14:52.615
what is going on
with you and Tony?

14:52.615 --> 14:54.583
- I'm, you know, we're fine.

14:54.583 --> 14:56.067
We're good.

14:56.067 --> 14:59.243
He gets on my nerves, but
that's just what men do.

14:59.243 --> 15:02.004
You know, but he spends so
much time with that hoe?

15:02.004 --> 15:03.695
I forget he even exists.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.007
- Here we go again.

15:05.007 --> 15:06.698
- Well, he does exist,
and stop calling

15:06.698 --> 15:07.907
that girl out of her name.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.115
You have no proof that
she's doing anything

15:09.115 --> 15:10.875
you're thinking about.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.601
- She's right.
- Yeah.

15:14.292 --> 15:16.812
- Don't forget to tell him to
come by the cookout tomorrow.

15:16.812 --> 15:17.744
- Okay.

15:17.744 --> 15:18.745
- Yeah, I can't wait for that.

15:18.745 --> 15:20.229
- Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

15:20.229 --> 15:21.161
It's been so long since
we got together like this.

15:21.161 --> 15:22.507
- [Tonya] It's been long.

15:22.507 --> 15:23.888
- Well, I hate that
I'm gonna miss it

15:23.888 --> 15:25.165
because I have a
hair appointment

15:25.165 --> 15:26.649
that I'm flying out for.

15:26.649 --> 15:29.929
- Okay, I see you girl, doing
big things, that's right.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.240
- She's going to
her mom's place.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.104
It happens this time every year.

15:33.104 --> 15:34.726
Oh.

15:34.726 --> 15:35.555
- Joykill.

15:35.555 --> 15:36.383
- Sometimes.

15:36.383 --> 15:37.212
[straw sucks drink]

15:37.212 --> 15:38.730
- Janet, girl, really?

15:38.730 --> 15:39.662
Stop drinking so much.

15:39.662 --> 15:41.664
We haven't even eaten yet.

15:41.664 --> 15:43.873
- Trina, I'll be fine.

15:43.873 --> 15:45.392
- All right, you're
gonna get a hangover.

15:45.392 --> 15:47.291
- Put the drink down.

15:47.291 --> 15:49.914
[gentle music]

15:57.163 --> 15:58.716
- I have a migraine.

15:58.716 --> 16:00.511
Do we have to go to the cookout?

16:00.511 --> 16:02.513
I'm sure Greg and Tonya
won't mind us backing out.

16:02.513 --> 16:03.341
- What?

16:03.341 --> 16:04.894
I would mind.

16:04.894 --> 16:08.898
Besides, nobody told you to
go out drinking last night.

16:08.898 --> 16:11.660
- Michael, please
don't start with me.

16:11.660 --> 16:13.386
Not right now.

16:13.386 --> 16:15.250
- Babe, I just,
you're drinking a lot,

16:15.250 --> 16:17.045
and I know what
drinking does to you,

16:17.045 --> 16:20.841
and you're starting to
make this a lifestyle.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.501
- Look, Michael, I'm
a grown-ass woman,

16:25.501 --> 16:28.849
and you knew I liked to
party when you met me.

16:28.849 --> 16:31.093
- All right, look.

16:31.093 --> 16:32.612
You going to have to decide.

16:32.612 --> 16:36.340
It's either gonna be me or
all this drinking and party,

16:36.340 --> 16:38.238
but we going to that cookout.

16:38.238 --> 16:41.517
So take you an aspirin
and get dressed.

16:44.658 --> 16:47.213
- Fine, I'll go to the cookout.

16:51.907 --> 16:54.392
After I take a nap, you happy?

16:56.153 --> 16:58.879
- Yeah, you better
do what I say.

16:58.879 --> 17:01.813
[phone rings]

17:01.813 --> 17:03.125
Hey, Greg, yeah.

17:04.713 --> 17:05.748
Yeah, I can do that.

17:05.748 --> 17:06.922
All right, um.

17:08.474 --> 17:10.132
Yeah, give me a minute.

17:10.132 --> 17:12.238
All right, see you there.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.569
- All right, let's go.

17:33.569 --> 17:37.711
- Michael, I said I
needed a nap before we go.

17:37.711 --> 17:38.919
Dang.

17:38.919 --> 17:40.404
- Well, Greg called me.

17:40.404 --> 17:41.819
He asked me to pick up a
few things from the store,

17:41.819 --> 17:43.062
so get dressed.

17:44.442 --> 17:47.894
- You're messing up my
sleep over some damn food?

17:47.894 --> 17:49.137
Really, Michael?

17:49.137 --> 17:51.932
- Nobody told you to go
out drinking last night.

17:51.932 --> 17:52.933
Get dressed.

18:01.977 --> 18:03.634
- [Janet] I'm tired.

18:03.634 --> 18:04.876
- I don't care.

18:06.637 --> 18:09.295
[wind whistles]

18:17.337 --> 18:18.338
- You ready for this cookout?

18:18.338 --> 18:19.788
- Yes.

18:19.788 --> 18:21.928
But I'm just nervous I
might've forgot some things.

18:21.928 --> 18:23.447
- Okay, what'd I tell
you about getting

18:23.447 --> 18:25.863
so worked up on things, huh?

18:25.863 --> 18:29.004
- I know, but I just want
everything to be perfect.

18:29.004 --> 18:30.592
- It will be, okay?

18:31.696 --> 18:33.077
And besides, I picked
up a few things

18:33.077 --> 18:35.079
after I made a few rounds,

18:35.079 --> 18:36.943
and I told Mike to, you
know, bring some stuff

18:36.943 --> 18:38.945
in case I miss anything.

18:43.260 --> 18:44.433
- What rounds?

18:47.126 --> 18:49.197
- Why you always question me?

18:49.197 --> 18:51.992
- Why you get so upset
when I ask you a question?

18:51.992 --> 18:53.649
Why can't I ask you what you do?

18:53.649 --> 18:58.275
- I get mad because
you shouldn't be
asking me questions.

18:58.275 --> 18:59.483
- All right, Gregory.

18:59.483 --> 19:01.105
Don't get yourself
all worked up.

19:01.105 --> 19:03.763
[ominous music]

19:05.454 --> 19:07.870
- I'm not, all right?

19:07.870 --> 19:10.149
Oh, and Keon, he was,

19:10.149 --> 19:11.736
he was telling me that one
of his friends was in town,

19:11.736 --> 19:13.669
so I told him to
bring him on by.

19:13.669 --> 19:15.223
- That's fine.

19:15.223 --> 19:16.258
- All right.

19:16.258 --> 19:17.708
I'm gonna go check on Tony,

19:17.708 --> 19:18.743
see if he needs help
with anything, all right?

19:18.743 --> 19:20.780
- Yep, I'll be down shortly.

19:20.780 --> 19:22.264
- Okay.

19:22.264 --> 19:24.956
[ominous music]

19:34.380 --> 19:37.176
[doorbell rings]

19:44.183 --> 19:45.391
- Hi, you two.

19:45.391 --> 19:46.599
- Hey, girl.

19:46.599 --> 19:47.496
You look good.
- Hey, thank you.

19:47.496 --> 19:48.463
- [Tonya] How are you?

19:48.463 --> 19:49.774
- [Janet] Great and you.

19:49.774 --> 19:51.190
- I guess I don't
look too snazzy.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.260
[they laugh]

19:52.260 --> 19:53.192
- You look nice, too, Mike.

19:53.192 --> 19:53.951
- [Mike] That's all right.

19:53.951 --> 19:55.055
- Hey.

19:55.055 --> 19:56.264
- Where's Greg?

19:56.264 --> 19:57.196
- He's out back
setting things up.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.162
- All right.

19:58.162 --> 19:59.577
- You're not on the grill?

19:59.577 --> 20:01.027
- No, girl, you know that's
more Gregory's thing,

20:01.027 --> 20:02.270
plus he didn't
feel like doing it,

20:02.270 --> 20:03.857
so he hired Tony's
catering company.

20:03.857 --> 20:05.100
- Oh, okay.

20:05.100 --> 20:06.619
Well, it was nice of
you all to invite us.

20:06.619 --> 20:07.758
- Of course, you hungry?

20:07.758 --> 20:10.347
- No, not really, I'm sleepy.

20:10.347 --> 20:11.244
- Let me guess.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.418
- Please don't.

20:12.418 --> 20:14.005
Mike was already
giving me a hard time.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.111
- Well, you need to
listen to him for once.

20:16.111 --> 20:17.595
Why you partying so much anyway?

20:17.595 --> 20:19.563
- You know I like to have fun.

20:19.563 --> 20:22.669
- Yeah, this may
be too much fun.

20:22.669 --> 20:24.499
Look, you can go
upstairs and lay down.

20:24.499 --> 20:26.052
I'll come get you
when everybody comes.

20:26.052 --> 20:27.260
- Thanks, girl.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.195
- I hate to say this, man, but

20:31.195 --> 20:33.991
I ain't gonna have money yet.

20:33.991 --> 20:37.063
- Greg, man, you
falling behind, man.

20:37.063 --> 20:40.653
Look, corporate's
tightening up, right.

20:40.653 --> 20:44.139
Plus, Tony, I think he can
only get us one more pack.

20:44.139 --> 20:45.761
- Listen, I know I said I was
supposed to have it for you,

20:45.761 --> 20:48.488
all right, but you gotta give
me a little bit more time.

20:48.488 --> 20:50.249
Listen, my buyer say he got
a few people interested,

20:50.249 --> 20:52.527
but I need to meet
up with him later.

20:52.527 --> 20:54.253
- Look, man, we don't
have no more time, man.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.875
I need that ASAP.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.532
All my money's going
into this loan.

20:57.532 --> 20:58.843
- Okay.

20:58.843 --> 21:00.086
- Plus Janet, I think
she's starting to put

21:00.086 --> 21:01.674
two and two together.

21:01.674 --> 21:03.469
- Michael, you
know me, all right.

21:03.469 --> 21:04.401
We go way back.

21:04.401 --> 21:05.885
I'm gonna get that for you.

21:05.885 --> 21:07.196
Hey, listen, I appreciate
you looking out for me

21:07.196 --> 21:08.439
when I got out.

21:09.578 --> 21:10.821
All right, don't even
worry about Janet.

21:10.821 --> 21:12.754
She ain't even sober
half the time anyway.

21:12.754 --> 21:14.307
- I know, but the
times she is sober,

21:14.307 --> 21:16.723
she's starting to figure it out.

21:16.723 --> 21:18.207
Tonya know?

21:18.207 --> 21:21.866
- Hell, no, and I ain't
tell her nothing either.

21:21.866 --> 21:23.454
Oh shit.

21:23.454 --> 21:24.455
- What's up?

21:26.354 --> 21:27.872
- I forgot, man.

21:27.872 --> 21:30.599
I'm gonna need you to make
a run with me tomorrow.

21:30.599 --> 21:31.600
- Man, look.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.155
All I do is the
numbers, that's it.

21:35.155 --> 21:36.778
- I'm serious.

21:36.778 --> 21:38.642
All right, my buyer wants
to know who I'm working with

21:38.642 --> 21:41.092
before he make any kind of move?

21:41.092 --> 21:42.370
- You two need anything?

21:42.370 --> 21:43.819
- Nah, we good, but
go ahead, sit down.

21:43.819 --> 21:44.889
Get up off your feet.

21:44.889 --> 21:45.856
- Where's Janet?

21:45.856 --> 21:47.064
- Upstairs to take a nap.

21:47.064 --> 21:49.204
She said she had a headache.

21:49.204 --> 21:49.998
- Figures.

21:50.999 --> 21:52.207
- What's up, man?

21:52.207 --> 21:54.416
[he sighs]

21:55.486 --> 21:56.453
- Man, it's Janet, man.

21:56.453 --> 21:58.075
She's partying all the time.

21:58.075 --> 22:01.009
Like I'm doing everything I
can to keep us together, right?

22:01.009 --> 22:03.322
And she just, look.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.082
I know neither one
of us are perfect,

22:05.082 --> 22:07.153
but I love her.

22:07.153 --> 22:09.293
And I want to spend the
rest of my life with her.

22:09.293 --> 22:10.708
- It's gonna be all right, man.

22:10.708 --> 22:12.331
Hey, but I bet Tonya
wouldn't go out like that

22:12.331 --> 22:14.056
and party so much, huh?

22:14.056 --> 22:14.885
- Greg, stop.

22:14.885 --> 22:15.817
Don't go there.

22:15.817 --> 22:17.439
Those days are long gone.

22:17.439 --> 22:18.923
But Michael, look.

22:18.923 --> 22:20.477
I'll talk to her, okay.

22:20.477 --> 22:21.719
Maybe if you didn't
work so much,

22:21.719 --> 22:23.342
she'd be home more.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.137
But you knew how she
was from the beginning.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.967
- I know that, but look.

22:27.967 --> 22:29.451
Somebody gotta work to
pay all these bills.

22:29.451 --> 22:31.453
- [laughs] Hey, I
know that's right.

22:31.453 --> 22:32.765
Shit, but hey.

22:32.765 --> 22:35.699
Tomorrow we go out, make
a few runs, you know.

22:35.699 --> 22:37.286
That'd probably ease
your mind on everything,

22:37.286 --> 22:40.945
but 'til then, let's
just enjoy today.

22:40.945 --> 22:42.671
[doorbell rings]

22:42.671 --> 22:43.914
- Babe, can you get that door

22:43.914 --> 22:45.536
while I go get Janet?

22:45.536 --> 22:47.331
- Yeah, I got it.

22:47.331 --> 22:48.988
- [Tonya] Thank you.

22:50.023 --> 22:53.648
[rhythmic pounding on door]

22:56.582 --> 22:58.515
- Yo, what's up my man, Keon?
- Hey, you, what's good?

22:58.515 --> 23:00.413
- What's going on, Big G?
- Nice seeing you, boy.

23:00.413 --> 23:01.966
- Yeah, man.

23:01.966 --> 23:03.727
Hey, this my homeboy Ricardo
I was telling you about.

23:03.727 --> 23:04.900
- Oh, Rico.

23:04.900 --> 23:06.177
- It's Ricardo.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.455
- Oh, my bad, man,
nice to meet you.

23:07.455 --> 23:08.663
- Nice to meet you, too.

23:08.663 --> 23:09.595
Appreciate the invite.

23:09.595 --> 23:10.803
- Oh, no, don't worry about it.

23:10.803 --> 23:11.735
Hey, I was out back
talking with Mike, man.

23:11.735 --> 23:12.736
You all, let's come on in.

23:12.736 --> 23:14.185
- Hey, no, thanks, man.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.670
Hey, the food smells
good, by the way.

23:15.670 --> 23:18.051
- Yeah, man, Tony whipping up
something nice for us, man.

23:18.051 --> 23:19.570
He back there doing his thing.

23:19.570 --> 23:20.537
- Hey, that's cool, that's cool.

23:20.537 --> 23:21.883
Hey, where the fool at anyway?

23:21.883 --> 23:23.402
- Shit, I don't
know, I mean, he said

23:23.402 --> 23:24.472
once he was done, he had to
go take care a few stuff.

23:24.472 --> 23:25.473
He be right back.

23:25.473 --> 23:26.577
- Yeah, dang.

23:27.958 --> 23:28.786
Yeah.

23:30.167 --> 23:33.826
Hm, how can a security guy
afford a house like this anyway?

23:33.826 --> 23:36.000
Ain't none of my business.

23:43.663 --> 23:45.872
- Janet, wake up.

23:45.872 --> 23:46.804
Wake up.

23:46.804 --> 23:49.428
- All right, all right, I'm up.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.084
Thank you, girl, for
letting me sleep.

23:51.084 --> 23:53.017
- No problem.

23:53.017 --> 23:54.743
- I'm just so tired.

23:54.743 --> 23:58.333
Me and Trina partied so hard
last night before she left.

23:58.333 --> 24:00.577
- You need to take it easy.

24:00.577 --> 24:01.785
- One day.

24:01.785 --> 24:03.545
That's not gonna
change no time soon.

24:03.545 --> 24:05.236
- Y'all never quit, do you?

24:05.236 --> 24:07.342
I mean, what did Michael
about all of this?

24:07.342 --> 24:08.792
- Say about what?

24:08.792 --> 24:10.207
I mean, what can he say?

24:10.207 --> 24:12.209
I like to have fun, that's all.

24:12.209 --> 24:14.349
- Maybe you're
having too much fun.

24:14.349 --> 24:15.281
- Too much fun?

24:15.281 --> 24:16.765
No such thing.

24:16.765 --> 24:18.008
You should try it.

24:18.008 --> 24:19.458
You should come out
with us one time.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.011
- No, I'm good.

24:21.011 --> 24:22.944
Plus I'm always grading papers.

24:22.944 --> 24:24.739
I don't have time for that.

24:24.739 --> 24:25.809
- All right.

24:25.809 --> 24:26.637
- Well, come on.

24:26.637 --> 24:28.536
They're waiting for us.

24:33.644 --> 24:36.751
- So Keon told me you
were in the service?

24:36.751 --> 24:37.752
- Yeah.

24:37.752 --> 24:39.029
- Yeah?

24:39.029 --> 24:40.582
Well, you know, I
do a little time,

24:40.582 --> 24:42.998
but they kicked my
ass out, you know.

24:42.998 --> 24:43.827
- Oh, word.

24:43.827 --> 24:44.931
- Yeah, yeah.

24:45.863 --> 24:48.625
Hey, Tonya, come
here real quick.

24:50.868 --> 24:52.801
Ricardo, this my girl, Tonya.

24:52.801 --> 24:54.044
This is Ricardo.

24:54.044 --> 24:55.942
- Oh, nice to meet you.

24:57.703 --> 24:59.670
- Nice to meet you, too.

24:59.670 --> 25:03.018
Where I come from, we give hugs.

25:03.018 --> 25:03.847
- Oh.

25:11.613 --> 25:12.821
I'll be right back.

25:12.821 --> 25:15.514
[ominous music]

25:19.310 --> 25:21.278
- Hey, girl, party's here.

25:21.278 --> 25:22.521
- Your boo thang is here.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.695
- Oh shit, Dewayne
Johnson's here?

25:24.695 --> 25:27.111
[she laughs]

25:29.528 --> 25:30.667
Hey, girl.
- Hey.

25:30.667 --> 25:31.978
- How are you?

25:31.978 --> 25:34.118
- Hungover still, but you know,

25:34.118 --> 25:35.603
the dictator wanted
to come early.

25:35.603 --> 25:37.087
- What's going on now?

25:37.087 --> 25:38.675
- Kim, what isn't going on?

25:38.675 --> 25:40.159
- Keep your head up, okay?

25:40.159 --> 25:42.402
Let's enjoy the time with
our friends while we have it.

25:42.402 --> 25:43.852
Things always get better.

25:43.852 --> 25:45.578
- Yeah, you may be right.

25:45.578 --> 25:46.890
Did you hear if
Trina made it safely?

25:46.890 --> 25:48.098
- Yeah, she texted
me, but she said

25:48.098 --> 25:49.962
she tried to contact you, too.

25:49.962 --> 25:51.791
- Oh, you know my
phone has its days.

25:51.791 --> 25:53.586
- It's hungover
when you are, right?

25:53.586 --> 25:55.139
[they laugh]

25:55.139 --> 25:55.968
- Yeah.

25:59.488 --> 26:00.420
- Oh, come on.

26:00.420 --> 26:01.214
- [Kim] What's going on, guys?

26:01.214 --> 26:02.146
How is everybody?

26:02.146 --> 26:03.423
- Pretty good, how about you?

26:03.423 --> 26:04.735
- [Kim] I'm great,
thanks for asking.

26:04.735 --> 26:05.564
- Hey, what's up, Kim?

26:05.564 --> 26:06.806
This is homeboy Ricardo.

26:06.806 --> 26:08.325
Ricardo, this is my girl, Kim.

26:08.325 --> 26:11.880
- Oh, so you're the one
Keon won't shut up about.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.088
- See, this is what happens

26:13.088 --> 26:16.022
when you keep my
name in your mouth,

26:16.022 --> 26:18.922
but it's nice to
meet you, Ricardo.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.170
- I'm gonna go grab a drink.

26:26.170 --> 26:28.552
- All right, whatever.

26:28.552 --> 26:30.968
[Keon sighs]

26:36.871 --> 26:39.218
- Hey, it's been a
long time, Tonya.

26:39.218 --> 26:41.807
I see you're still looking good.

26:41.807 --> 26:43.291
- Thanks, Rico.

26:43.291 --> 26:44.948
Yes, it has.

26:44.948 --> 26:47.122
- You know, you're the only
one that calls me that.

26:47.122 --> 26:49.055
- [Gregory] Man, what of
these boys out here, man?

26:49.055 --> 26:50.574
- This game is crazy, man.

26:50.574 --> 26:51.955
Cowboys wouldn't even come
through for the play today.

26:51.955 --> 26:53.646
I don't know what's going on.
- Cowboys stink, ooh.

26:53.646 --> 26:54.613
- [Gregory] This
is bullshit, man.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.338
Cowboys are stinkin' up on.

26:56.338 --> 26:57.270
- Hey, I'm gonna be right back.

26:57.270 --> 26:58.478
I just gonna see Ricardo.

26:58.478 --> 27:01.585
- [Gregory] Yeah,
yeah, yeah, go ahead.

27:01.585 --> 27:03.345
- I'm just saying, how long
you gonna keep dodging me

27:03.345 --> 27:05.624
and pretend like
you don't know me?

27:05.624 --> 27:07.039
You were mine.

27:07.039 --> 27:08.143
- See?
- Did you tell him that?

27:08.143 --> 27:09.386
- There you go.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.182
That was a long time ago,

27:12.182 --> 27:14.011
and I prefer we
keep it that way.

27:14.011 --> 27:15.564
I'm happily with Gregory now.

27:15.564 --> 27:16.635
- I don't care.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.497
- What's good, bro?

27:17.497 --> 27:18.360
You having fun?

27:18.360 --> 27:19.568
- Yeah, it's cool.

27:19.568 --> 27:20.362
- Hey, well, come
on, and quit mingling

27:20.362 --> 27:21.398
with just one person.

27:21.398 --> 27:22.330
- Man, don't go there.

27:22.330 --> 27:23.572
I just came and grabbed a drink.

27:23.572 --> 27:24.746
- Uh-huh, yeah.

27:24.746 --> 27:27.542
- Man, chill.
- What you thinking?

27:32.858 --> 27:36.102
- Damn, man [sighs].

27:36.102 --> 27:40.037
[game audience cheering on TV]

27:44.663 --> 27:47.355
[ominous music]

27:59.678 --> 28:00.609
- You good, baby?

28:00.609 --> 28:01.956
- Yeah, I'm good.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.340
[ominous music]

28:12.104 --> 28:15.624
[upbeat but gentle music]

28:18.386 --> 28:20.837
- [Man] Oh, come on.

28:20.837 --> 28:22.355
[man exclaims]

28:22.355 --> 28:24.012
- [Man] Oh, bullshit.

28:24.012 --> 28:26.221
- The game is on.
- Ricardo, yeah.

28:26.221 --> 28:28.051
- [Keon] I got another twenty.

28:28.051 --> 28:30.916
- Yeah, man, come on, man.
- Aw, bullshit.

28:30.916 --> 28:33.332
[they mutter about game]

28:33.332 --> 28:34.609
- I'm sorry I'm late, bro.

28:34.609 --> 28:35.817
You know what I'm saying?

28:35.817 --> 28:37.094
I stopped by the
office real quick.

28:37.094 --> 28:38.371
- [Gregory] Yeah, man,
why'd you bring her--

28:38.371 --> 28:40.373
- Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

28:40.373 --> 28:42.686
Tony, man, why you
smell like perfume?

28:42.686 --> 28:43.756
- Shit, what?

28:44.964 --> 28:46.379
- [Tony] I don't smell
like no damn perfume.

28:46.379 --> 28:49.210
- Yeah, uh-huh, but
anyway, how you been?

28:49.210 --> 28:51.281
- Good, man, I can't complain.

28:51.281 --> 28:52.834
You know, just
working late hours.

28:52.834 --> 28:54.111
- That's what's up.

28:54.111 --> 28:55.319
Yeah, and I heard your
business is a success.

28:55.319 --> 28:57.114
Hey, the food today,
definitely good.

28:57.114 --> 28:58.529
- Hey, I appreciate
that, family.

28:58.529 --> 29:00.428
I don't get no complaints, so.

29:00.428 --> 29:01.878
- Good, good.

29:01.878 --> 29:03.534
And hey, by the way, this
is my homeboy Ricardo.

29:03.534 --> 29:05.571
Ricardo, this is Tony
who's always late.

29:05.571 --> 29:08.747
And that over
there, my friend, is

29:08.747 --> 29:11.646
his mama [speaks Spanish].

29:11.646 --> 29:13.544
- Keon, shut up.

29:13.544 --> 29:14.753
- So, uh, Vanessa.

29:14.753 --> 29:15.857
What's it like
working with Tony?

29:15.857 --> 29:17.272
- Oh, it's so much fun.

29:17.272 --> 29:18.515
- I'm sure.

29:18.515 --> 29:20.068
- I'm learning a lot
about healthcare.

29:20.068 --> 29:21.552
- Yeah?

29:21.552 --> 29:23.831
I heard it's a lot of long
hours and late nights?

29:23.831 --> 29:25.556
- Yes, Tony's a hard worker.

29:25.556 --> 29:27.593
We don't leave 'til
everything's done perfectly.

all night with you.

her all the time.

an appointment with her,

29:36.291 --> 29:38.259
but they say she's booked.

29:38.259 --> 29:39.778
- Booked?

29:39.778 --> 29:42.090
I mean, she's pretty much
free as anything these days.

Ow, yeah, booked,
she's totally booked.

We definitely gotta
do it again, guys.

sorry I volunteered.

my woman, we gotta run.

It's the least I can do.

know what you just said,

us to be better,

heal in my own way.

gonna kill our vibe, right?

harder to make things work.

36:39.369 --> 36:42.303
and she could tell
you for herself?

compare me to another woman.

40:29.047 --> 40:30.013
- Shit, I just
give her that money

40:30.013 --> 40:32.360
and give her that you know.

40:32.360 --> 40:35.363
[they laugh]

40:35.363 --> 40:37.538
It's taking long, man [mumbles].

40:37.538 --> 40:39.747
- [Tony] What's up, fellas?

40:39.747 --> 40:40.714
- Man, you can never
- Good.

40:40.714 --> 40:41.680
- [Gregory] be on time, can you?

40:41.680 --> 40:43.233
- Man, don't start with me, bro.

40:43.233 --> 40:45.822
You know how hard it is to
make one of those disappear?

40:45.822 --> 40:48.446
[ominous music]

40:53.796 --> 40:55.314
- Yeah.

40:55.314 --> 40:58.766
Yeah, this look good,
this look real good.

40:59.974 --> 41:01.873
Are you all boys
ready to head out?

41:01.873 --> 41:04.979
- Shit, I'm not
going with you fools.

41:07.050 --> 41:07.879
- Fools.

41:10.019 --> 41:11.296
If it wasn't for me,
it would have been

41:11.296 --> 41:13.471
your asses locked
up for that crime.

41:13.471 --> 41:14.713
So if I say ready to head out,

41:14.713 --> 41:17.095
the only answer I
expect to hear is when.

41:17.095 --> 41:18.683
- Nigger, whatever.

41:19.787 --> 41:21.548
I told your monkey ass.

41:21.548 --> 41:23.998
I told you not to get out
the car and make that sale.

41:23.998 --> 41:25.241
Didn't I?

41:25.241 --> 41:28.106
But no, you didn't
want to listen.

41:28.106 --> 41:30.626
It ain't my fault you
got popped by a twelve.

41:30.626 --> 41:33.214
I don't give a fuck if
I was driving or not.

41:33.214 --> 41:35.562
And Michael shouldn't
have even been in the car.

41:35.562 --> 41:38.496
He was on his way
to get out the hood.

41:38.496 --> 41:42.051
But you ain't gonna let that
happen, though, are you?

41:42.051 --> 41:44.812
That right here,
consider us even, man.

41:44.812 --> 41:46.089
- Wait, wait, let
me get into it.

41:46.089 --> 41:48.436
- Hey, hey, hey
Greg, man, chill.

41:49.990 --> 41:51.509
- Yo, Mike a grown-ass man.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.994
He knew exactly what he
was getting himself into.

41:53.994 --> 41:55.892
And no you stay throwing
that in my face.

41:55.892 --> 41:59.482
I lost five years of
my life because of it.

42:00.379 --> 42:02.485
But you know what?

42:02.485 --> 42:04.245
None of that matters,

42:04.245 --> 42:06.385
because after this
deal, we through.

42:06.385 --> 42:08.595
Get the hell out of my way.

42:10.251 --> 42:12.978
[dramatic music]

42:16.982 --> 42:18.812
- Mike, you don't
have to do this, man.

42:18.812 --> 42:21.055
You don't owe that fool shit.

42:21.055 --> 42:23.782
[dramatic music]

42:31.238 --> 42:34.552
Don't fuck up your life, Mike.

42:34.552 --> 42:37.555
Somebody might die
behind this shit.

42:41.110 --> 42:42.767
- [Mike] Where we at?

42:42.767 --> 42:44.562
- Had to make a stop real quick.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.425
- What kind of stop?

42:46.425 --> 42:48.980
- You know the stops we used
to make back in the day?

42:48.980 --> 42:51.396
- Come on, I can't believe
you got me out here.

42:51.396 --> 42:52.742
- Stop whining, man.

42:52.742 --> 42:54.675
- [Mike] Fuck you, man.

42:54.675 --> 42:56.125
[Gregory laughs]

42:56.125 --> 42:57.436
- Hey, let's go.

42:59.404 --> 43:01.786
[Mike groans]

43:03.373 --> 43:06.031
[ominous music]

43:07.343 --> 43:09.345
- Where my money at, yo?

43:12.728 --> 43:16.076
I said where the
fuck my money at?

43:16.076 --> 43:17.318
- Hey, man, look.

43:17.318 --> 43:18.768
I already gave you
all your money, man.

43:18.768 --> 43:20.011
- Nah, nah, nah.

43:20.011 --> 43:20.943
You only gave me
some of my money.

43:20.943 --> 43:23.566
I need all that money right now.

43:23.566 --> 43:24.774
- What?

43:24.774 --> 43:26.983
- Yeah, you better sit
your mother fucking ass.

43:26.983 --> 43:28.364
- Yo, chill, bae, chill, Ricky.

43:28.364 --> 43:29.676
How much I owe you?

43:29.676 --> 43:30.677
- Man, don't play me.

43:30.677 --> 43:32.161
You know exactly
what you owe me.

43:32.161 --> 43:33.369
- I was supposed
to get that money,

43:33.369 --> 43:35.509
but a couple workers
didn't give me my money.

43:35.509 --> 43:36.717
[Gregory mutters
under his breath]

43:36.717 --> 43:38.132
So yo, just give
me a little time.

43:38.132 --> 43:39.651
- Nah, I ain't tryin'
to hear none of that.

43:39.651 --> 43:41.101
- Hey, that's it?

43:42.309 --> 43:43.586
- Listen, homie.

43:43.586 --> 43:44.898
You ain't stupid.

43:44.898 --> 43:46.313
Drop it.

43:46.313 --> 43:47.590
- Hey, hey, hey, hey come on.

43:47.590 --> 43:49.385
Hey, listen, listen,
let's just be cool.

43:49.385 --> 43:50.731
He said he got some workers.

43:50.731 --> 43:52.768
Hey, we'll come back.

43:52.768 --> 43:54.079
- Listen, he say

43:54.079 --> 43:55.356
he just need a little time.
[others argue]

43:55.356 --> 43:56.564
I don't know what the
fuck you got to do.

43:56.564 --> 43:59.567
- Chill, chill,
bruh, chill, come on.

43:59.567 --> 44:02.122
Look it, bruh, we'll
just come back.

44:02.122 --> 44:03.054
He said he got some workers,

44:03.054 --> 44:04.676
bring him up some [mumbles].

44:04.676 --> 44:05.953
We'll come back, man, it's good.

44:05.953 --> 44:07.541
We'll come back.

44:07.541 --> 44:09.474
[ominous music]

44:09.474 --> 44:11.683
- You better have
my money by tonight.

44:11.683 --> 44:13.581
[man mumbles]

44:13.581 --> 44:15.618
I'll be waiting.

44:15.618 --> 44:17.931
- Let's get out of here, Rick.

44:17.931 --> 44:18.759
Shit.

44:18.759 --> 44:20.209
- See you, slick.

44:21.900 --> 44:23.005
- Who this punk ass think he is?

44:23.005 --> 44:24.109
Trying to play me.

44:24.109 --> 44:25.352
- What?

44:25.352 --> 44:29.183
- What the fuck?
[gunshots explode]

44:31.703 --> 44:32.704
- [Trina] All righty, ma'am.

44:32.704 --> 44:33.705
We are done.

44:35.880 --> 44:37.364
Here you go.

44:37.364 --> 44:38.227
- [Customer] Thank you.

44:38.227 --> 44:39.987
- No, thank you.

44:39.987 --> 44:41.230
All right, who's next?

44:41.230 --> 44:42.472
- Oh, that would be me.
- I'm next.

44:42.472 --> 44:43.301
- No, I'm next.

44:43.301 --> 44:44.543
- No, I'm next.

44:44.543 --> 44:46.753
- Um, excuse me,
I was here first.

44:46.753 --> 44:48.375
- [Customer] No.

44:48.375 --> 44:49.203
- Look in the book.

44:49.203 --> 44:50.032
My name is in the book.

44:50.032 --> 44:51.067
- No, I'm next.

44:51.067 --> 44:51.999
She came late.

44:51.999 --> 44:52.862
I'm next.
- Yeah, right.

44:52.862 --> 44:54.105
- Okay.

44:54.105 --> 44:55.037
- All right, where
is my secretary?

44:55.037 --> 44:55.831
- Yeah, get your secretary.

44:55.831 --> 44:56.763
- I'm here.

44:57.902 --> 45:00.490
- Dang, girl, can
you just do your job?

45:00.490 --> 45:02.423
Anyway, who is next?

45:02.423 --> 45:03.666
- You had two call-outs,

45:03.666 --> 45:06.773
and Vanessa Woods
made an appointment.

45:06.773 --> 45:08.636
- Oh, hell, no, mm-mm.

45:08.636 --> 45:11.225
Tell that little homewrecker
I'm booked, okay.

45:11.225 --> 45:12.813
- But you're not, Trina.

45:12.813 --> 45:14.159
- Did you hear what I just said?

45:14.159 --> 45:15.091
I'm booked.

45:15.989 --> 45:17.853
My last appointment is at four.

45:17.853 --> 45:19.130
If she wants her hair done,

45:19.130 --> 45:22.823
she can let Kim do it
if she has free time.

45:22.823 --> 45:23.686
Jesus.

45:29.657 --> 45:32.143
[phone rings]

45:34.145 --> 45:34.973
- Hello.

45:34.973 --> 45:37.424
- Hey, girl, you busy?

45:37.424 --> 45:39.253
Let me tell you
what just happened.

45:39.253 --> 45:41.566
How 'bout Miss
Ho-nessa had the nerve

45:41.566 --> 45:43.361
to schedule an
appointment with me.

45:43.361 --> 45:45.432
- Tony's assistant?

45:45.432 --> 45:46.467
Girl, you better
forget all that,

45:46.467 --> 45:47.779
and just make your money.

45:47.779 --> 45:49.643
That is your business
you're talking about.

45:49.643 --> 45:52.370
- Yeah, a business
I could do without.

45:52.370 --> 45:53.992
Do you know, I know you
all think I'm crazy,

45:53.992 --> 45:55.753
but I just got this gut feeling

45:55.753 --> 45:58.479
that her and Tony
are messing around.

45:58.479 --> 46:00.309
And I just haven't
caught them yet.

46:00.309 --> 46:01.689
- Mm-mm.

46:01.689 --> 46:04.692
Girl, you need to forget that.

46:04.692 --> 46:08.489
- But anyway, how's
your new side boo thing?

46:08.489 --> 46:10.975
- First of all, Marvin
is not my boo thing,

46:10.975 --> 46:14.323
and we only had a
couple of conversations.

46:14.323 --> 46:17.878
But he keeps asking
about Michael.

46:17.878 --> 46:18.810
- Oh, okay.

46:20.260 --> 46:22.503
Well, you know, maybe he's one
of those down-low brothers.

46:22.503 --> 46:24.436
I mean, we do live
in Atlanta, right?

46:24.436 --> 46:27.785
[customer clears throat]

46:27.785 --> 46:29.890
Anyway, girl, I gotta go.

46:31.064 --> 46:33.307
Come by tomorrow
if you can, okay?

46:33.307 --> 46:36.310
All right, cause my
client's in here tripping.

46:36.310 --> 46:37.139
[customer sighs]

46:37.139 --> 46:38.865
- Oh, no, she didn't.

46:40.314 --> 46:41.557
- All right, you come on.

46:41.557 --> 46:42.661
- I was--

46:42.661 --> 46:44.594
- Hard luck, excuse me.

46:46.976 --> 46:49.910
[knocking on door]

46:52.533 --> 46:54.604
- Hey, my secretary here.

46:58.436 --> 47:00.610
- Now what was that last night?

47:00.610 --> 47:02.785
- That was his warning.

47:02.785 --> 47:04.683
Next time he's gonna get
what's coming to him.

47:04.683 --> 47:05.615
- That's the same
thing they gonna say

47:05.615 --> 47:06.824
when they come looking for us.

47:06.824 --> 47:07.790
- Shit, I don't give a fuck.

47:07.790 --> 47:09.309
We all gotta die someday, right?

47:09.309 --> 47:10.897
- What about Tonya?

47:13.106 --> 47:14.555
- What about her?

47:14.555 --> 47:15.833
I mean, she acting all brand new

47:15.833 --> 47:17.731
with her little side piece now.

47:17.731 --> 47:18.559
- What?

47:19.560 --> 47:21.424
- Nothing, man.

47:21.424 --> 47:24.842
Cause you know what,
none of that matters.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.050
That's why I got those
cameras all installed

47:26.050 --> 47:27.603
inside of the house.

47:27.603 --> 47:29.639
Watching everything she do.

47:29.639 --> 47:32.677
- Man, you still on
this kid shit, man.

47:32.677 --> 47:34.437
I don't know about you,

47:34.437 --> 47:38.856
but I'm trying to grow old
with my lady by my side.

47:38.856 --> 47:39.857
- You planning on
making that happen

47:39.857 --> 47:42.376
with the lifestyle you living?

47:43.757 --> 47:45.517
- If it comes to this life,

47:45.517 --> 47:47.588
or the life I plan on living,

47:47.588 --> 47:50.315
nigger, the choice simple.

47:50.315 --> 47:52.835
- Well, we got a job tomorrow,

47:54.147 --> 47:56.494
and you are gonna finish it.

47:56.494 --> 47:58.289
You know, I'm meeting with
this potential buyer tomorrow,

47:58.289 --> 48:00.049
and I already took the
shipments out of the briefcase

48:00.049 --> 48:02.017
before giving it to them.

48:02.017 --> 48:03.535
Yeah.

48:03.535 --> 48:04.364
- Nah.

48:05.261 --> 48:06.884
It's our anniversary tomorrow.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.092
- Get out of here.

48:08.092 --> 48:08.920
- Yeah.

48:08.920 --> 48:10.094
- Yeah?

48:10.094 --> 48:11.336
Wow.
- It's been a rough couple

48:11.336 --> 48:13.545
of years, but we made it.
- Yeah.

48:13.545 --> 48:17.411
- Yeah, well, you know,
congratu-fucking-lations.

48:17.411 --> 48:21.933
Celebrating with a woman
that can't even stand you.

48:21.933 --> 48:25.488
You better get your
priorities in order.

48:25.488 --> 48:26.317
- I am.

48:27.283 --> 48:29.113
You better take your own advice.

48:29.113 --> 48:31.805
[ominous music]

48:33.013 --> 48:34.601
- See you tomorrow.

48:38.398 --> 48:40.848
[door slams]

48:47.200 --> 48:48.028
- Fuck.

48:57.796 --> 49:00.351
[dogs barking]

49:09.947 --> 49:11.431
- [Marvin] Oh, Jesus.

49:11.431 --> 49:13.951
- Why the fuck you
haven't checked in yet?

49:13.951 --> 49:16.194
- Because there's
nothing to report.

49:16.194 --> 49:17.471
- It's been a few weeks, man.

49:17.471 --> 49:20.302
What you mean, you
ain't got nothing?

49:21.959 --> 49:23.236
- Look, David, I don't--

49:23.236 --> 49:25.963
- That's Commander
Tate to your ass.

49:25.963 --> 49:26.825
- Yeah?

49:27.826 --> 49:29.449
Get off your high horse.

49:29.449 --> 49:31.554
You got that promotion,
what, a month ago?

49:31.554 --> 49:33.694
And you're having a power trip?

49:33.694 --> 49:35.248
Relax.

49:35.248 --> 49:37.008
- Watch yourself, Marvin.

49:37.008 --> 49:38.734
We have a job to do,

49:38.734 --> 49:39.977
and I seem to be the
only one interested

49:39.977 --> 49:41.185
in getting it done.

49:41.185 --> 49:42.669
- Hey, I've been working Janet.

49:42.669 --> 49:45.844
She just does not want
to talk about him.

49:45.844 --> 49:48.778
Any time I even
mention him, she just,

49:48.778 --> 49:50.815
she gets frustrated and
she shuts herself down.

just gotta give people

he'll kill the both of us.

this with you.

01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:45.365
- Yeah.
- You sure?

01:00:45.365 --> 01:00:47.022
- Yeah, we're sure.

01:00:47.022 --> 01:00:48.783
- Nah, I can't make it.

01:00:48.783 --> 01:00:51.268
I gotta meet Greg at the office.

01:00:51.268 --> 01:00:54.064
- Michael, I really don't feel
like you should go with him.

01:00:54.064 --> 01:00:56.238
I really need you to
be with me right now.

01:00:56.238 --> 01:00:57.826
What's more important?

01:00:57.826 --> 01:00:59.517
[ominous music]

01:00:59.517 --> 01:01:02.175
- Ooh [mumbles].

01:01:03.763 --> 01:01:05.351
- Just go, Michael.

01:01:06.248 --> 01:01:07.664
Just go.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:10.321
[ominous music]

01:01:31.342 --> 01:01:32.654
- Why'd you call me here?

01:01:32.654 --> 01:01:34.069
I can't keep doing
this with you.

01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:36.520
- I just want to talk to you.

01:01:38.487 --> 01:01:41.042
Listen, before I leave,

01:01:41.042 --> 01:01:43.665
I just wanted you to know
I never stopped loving you,

01:01:43.665 --> 01:01:45.080
and I see you with another man.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.565
It's the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

01:01:47.565 --> 01:01:50.085
The times we spent together
meant everything to me.

01:01:50.085 --> 01:01:52.916
- Ricardo, we were
young and in love.

01:01:52.916 --> 01:01:56.574
But we should've just
kept that in the past.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:00.958
- Did you ever
think of us, of me?

01:02:00.958 --> 01:02:02.546
Did you even ever?

01:02:02.546 --> 01:02:04.306
- Of course I did.

01:02:04.306 --> 01:02:05.480
But I didn't want to
dwell on something,

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.412
knowing that there was a chance

01:02:06.412 --> 01:02:08.586
I would never see you again.

01:02:08.586 --> 01:02:10.140
You had your mind made
up to go into the service

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:12.142
even before you told me.

01:02:13.005 --> 01:02:14.247
I couldn't go with you.

01:02:14.247 --> 01:02:16.422
I wasn't ready for that.

01:02:16.422 --> 01:02:17.250
- I know.

01:02:18.596 --> 01:02:20.702
And that's something I regret.

01:02:20.702 --> 01:02:23.187
I should've never went at all.

01:02:24.913 --> 01:02:28.572
But when I did, I missed
you right then and there.

01:02:28.572 --> 01:02:30.781
[he sighs]

01:02:34.198 --> 01:02:35.510
Remember that time we
snuck into the movies

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:38.168
five times and had a little fun?

01:02:40.377 --> 01:02:42.551
- Yeah, and that
night when I got home,

01:02:42.551 --> 01:02:43.656
I couldn't even
remember the name

01:02:43.656 --> 01:02:46.452
for one movie when my mom asked.

01:02:46.452 --> 01:02:47.591
- Me either.

01:02:47.591 --> 01:02:50.456
[they chuckle]

01:02:50.456 --> 01:02:51.284
Man.

01:02:52.907 --> 01:02:55.461
[gentle music]

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.782
I'm leaving in a couple days.

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:07.576
I get deployed again.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:18.173
- So I guess this is goodbye.

01:03:27.596 --> 01:03:30.910
- I want you to read
this after I leave.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:34.638
Be good.

01:03:35.535 --> 01:03:37.399
I hope he makes you happy,

01:03:37.399 --> 01:03:39.160
and he never lets go.

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:57.972
- Ricardo, wait.

01:04:00.664 --> 01:04:03.287
[ominous music]

01:04:29.175 --> 01:04:31.626
[door slams]

01:04:33.317 --> 01:04:34.629
- Who the fuck
you think you are?

01:04:34.629 --> 01:04:35.975
Who the fuck you
think you are, huh?

01:04:35.975 --> 01:04:37.252
I saw the way you looked at her.

01:04:37.252 --> 01:04:38.322
I saw the way you looked at her.

01:04:38.322 --> 01:04:39.806
She belongs to me.

01:04:39.806 --> 01:04:43.017
I never liked your
punk ass since day one.

01:04:43.017 --> 01:04:43.983
- I'm sorry.

01:04:43.983 --> 01:04:46.158
I was just saying goodbye.

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:51.197
- Oh, shit, you
just saying goodbye?

01:04:51.197 --> 01:04:52.198
- Yeah.
- Oh.

01:04:54.304 --> 01:04:55.546
[he laughs]

01:04:55.546 --> 01:04:58.722
- Aw, man, you was
just saying goodbye.

01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:01.069
Yeah, man.

01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:03.347
You gonna be all right?

01:05:03.347 --> 01:05:04.279
- Yeah.

01:05:04.279 --> 01:05:06.212
- Yeah, saying goodbye.

01:05:09.526 --> 01:05:10.354
Goodbye.

01:05:10.354 --> 01:05:11.493
[gunshot fires]

01:05:11.493 --> 01:05:14.324
[bird wings flap]

01:05:18.397 --> 01:05:21.055
[ominous music]

01:05:32.376 --> 01:05:33.274
- That now.

01:05:41.178 --> 01:05:42.628
- Hey, clear out.

01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:52.396
- See, this is the bullshit
we're trying to prevent.

01:05:52.396 --> 01:05:55.054
- That's one of Janet's friends.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.058
- [Policeman] Yo, boss.

01:06:12.623 --> 01:06:14.004
- Look who it is.

01:06:24.877 --> 01:06:26.361
- Got it?
- Got it.

01:06:29.675 --> 01:06:32.333
[ominous music]

01:06:49.039 --> 01:06:52.870
- I mean, I just can't
believe you're a cop.

01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:54.355
So that's why you've
been asking Janet

01:06:54.355 --> 01:06:56.184
about Michael so much?

01:06:58.773 --> 01:07:00.947
You tried to use my friend.

01:07:01.983 --> 01:07:03.088
That's just pathetic.

01:07:03.088 --> 01:07:04.675
- Look, I am sorry,

01:07:06.712 --> 01:07:10.578
but I need you ladies
to cooperate with me.

01:07:10.578 --> 01:07:14.409
Now I know none of
you want to hear this,

01:07:14.409 --> 01:07:18.482
but Gregory has been dealing
a new synthetic drug.

01:07:18.482 --> 01:07:21.071
And it is flooding our streets.

01:07:22.245 --> 01:07:25.386
We already have 20
cases of overdoses.

01:07:29.493 --> 01:07:33.187
Now, we've been watching
him for some time,

01:07:33.187 --> 01:07:36.259
but to make his matters worse,

01:07:36.259 --> 01:07:38.847
we believe he's killed someone.

01:07:38.847 --> 01:07:40.884
- Wait, Gregory killed somebody?

01:07:40.884 --> 01:07:41.988
- Who was it?

01:07:43.024 --> 01:07:44.301
- I'm sorry.

01:07:44.301 --> 01:07:45.716
I can't disclose that info.

01:07:45.716 --> 01:07:46.821
- Who was it?

01:07:52.758 --> 01:07:54.000
Was it Ricardo?

01:07:57.314 --> 01:07:59.730
Oh, no, this is all my fault.

01:08:00.973 --> 01:08:03.320
Oh my God, this is my fault.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.805
- [Trina] Listen, this
is not your fault, okay?

01:08:05.805 --> 01:08:07.773
He's always had issues.

01:08:07.773 --> 01:08:09.430
It's not your fault.

01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:18.542
- I'm sorry,

01:08:20.751 --> 01:08:22.960
but if you know where
your boyfriend is,

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.203
please help us.

01:08:27.344 --> 01:08:28.621
- I don't know.

01:08:29.863 --> 01:08:31.417
I haven't seen him.

01:08:35.145 --> 01:08:37.319
- We're under the suspicion that

01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:40.770
he, Michael, and Tony have
all been working together.

01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:43.636
And if that's true,
they all three need

01:08:43.636 --> 01:08:45.913
to be brought into justice.

01:08:48.779 --> 01:08:49.608
I'm sorry.

01:08:55.613 --> 01:08:57.133
Can I talk to you?

01:08:58.685 --> 01:09:00.412
- It's gonna be okay.

01:09:04.278 --> 01:09:06.520
[she sobs]

01:09:10.698 --> 01:09:12.044
- Where's Janet?

01:09:19.258 --> 01:09:20.535
- Oh, the mail.

01:09:38.898 --> 01:09:41.555
[ominous music]

01:09:48.839 --> 01:09:50.323
- No, no, np.

01:09:50.323 --> 01:09:51.600
Please, please.

01:09:53.741 --> 01:09:54.569
Get out of my house.

01:09:54.569 --> 01:09:55.398
I'll call the police.

01:09:55.398 --> 01:09:57.365
- Bitch, shut up.

01:09:57.365 --> 01:09:58.815
Call 'em.

01:09:58.815 --> 01:10:02.439
You know the cops take
forever to come anyway.

01:10:02.439 --> 01:10:06.305
Hey, you'll be dead
before they get here.

01:10:06.305 --> 01:10:10.309
But I'll leave, if you
answer this one question.

01:10:13.761 --> 01:10:16.419
Where the fuck's your man at?

01:10:16.419 --> 01:10:18.766
- What do you want with him?

01:10:20.768 --> 01:10:23.080
- He got a price on his head.

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.668
- A very big price.

01:10:25.876 --> 01:10:28.258
- [Janet] What are
you talking about?

01:10:28.258 --> 01:10:31.123
- Look, I ain't
here for no games.

01:10:31.986 --> 01:10:34.471
Hey, this liquor kinda strong.

01:10:35.576 --> 01:10:37.336
Where's your man at?

01:10:37.336 --> 01:10:38.475
- I don't know.

01:10:38.475 --> 01:10:40.684
I haven't seen him all day.

01:10:41.892 --> 01:10:42.859
- [Ricky] She lying.

01:10:42.859 --> 01:10:45.206
- What is it you want, money?

01:10:45.206 --> 01:10:46.172
I'll get it for you.

01:10:46.172 --> 01:10:47.588
Just please don't hurt me.

01:10:47.588 --> 01:10:49.728
I'll do whatever you want.

01:10:49.728 --> 01:10:51.937
- Look like I need money?

01:10:51.937 --> 01:10:54.595
Nah, I'll just
leave this message.

01:10:54.595 --> 01:10:58.668
Tell Greg next time he
see me, he better kill me.

01:11:00.428 --> 01:11:01.567
Word, come on.

01:11:05.778 --> 01:11:08.505
[doorbell rings]

01:11:08.505 --> 01:11:10.921
- [Digital Voice] Front door.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.789
- So we have a new product
we need your approval on.

01:11:16.789 --> 01:11:19.309
- Okay, I'll sign off
on it tomorrow, okay?

01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:20.310
- Also, you're scheduled to meet

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:22.554
with Mr. Kennedy
Friday at 1 p.m.

01:11:22.554 --> 01:11:23.624
He wants to cover
a couple things

01:11:23.624 --> 01:11:25.177
before the end of January.

01:11:25.177 --> 01:11:26.903
- We should've spoken with
them before the holidays.

01:11:26.903 --> 01:11:27.835
I don't have time.

01:11:27.835 --> 01:11:29.285
- Oh my God, what did you do?

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:30.665
What did you do?

01:11:30.665 --> 01:11:31.908
- Shit.

01:11:31.908 --> 01:11:34.704
- Still up to the
same old shit again.

01:11:34.704 --> 01:11:36.395
And you probably
helping him out.

01:11:36.395 --> 01:11:37.327
- [Tony] Baby, listen, I--

01:11:37.327 --> 01:11:38.570
- Mrs. Roberts, please let me--

01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:40.261
- [Trina] Listen,
ho, you shut up.

01:11:40.261 --> 01:11:41.745
- [Tony] Back up.

01:11:41.745 --> 01:11:42.953
- Say something again and
I'll snatch them damn tracks

01:11:42.953 --> 01:11:46.232
out of your head and
shove them up your ass.

01:11:47.233 --> 01:11:49.201
Why would you do this?

01:11:49.201 --> 01:11:50.651
You had everything
you ever wanted.

01:11:50.651 --> 01:11:52.791
Why would you screw it up?

01:11:54.586 --> 01:11:56.381
No words, huh?

01:11:56.381 --> 01:11:57.589
Nothing to say.

01:11:59.176 --> 01:12:00.902
That's what I thought.

01:12:04.699 --> 01:12:05.804
- Hey, Janet.

01:12:06.839 --> 01:12:07.668
Hey.

01:12:09.152 --> 01:12:10.981
Hey, hey, babe, Janet.

01:12:13.225 --> 01:12:14.330
What's wrong?

01:12:16.608 --> 01:12:19.265
- Some thug forced his way
into our house, Michael,

01:12:19.265 --> 01:12:21.509
and pointed a gun at me.

01:12:21.509 --> 01:12:22.510
- Hey, what?

01:12:23.718 --> 01:12:26.100
- I told you not to
mess with him again.

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.171
He nearly screwed
up your life before,

01:12:28.171 --> 01:12:31.864
and you let him do
it all over again.

01:12:31.864 --> 01:12:33.556
Michael, what is going on?

01:12:33.556 --> 01:12:34.971
- Not now, Janet.

01:12:38.008 --> 01:12:40.563
- Greg is selling again, is he?

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:45.361
The news, they's talking
about that new drug

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:46.879
out on the streets.

01:12:46.879 --> 01:12:49.710
And I found a
bottle in the trash.

01:12:52.126 --> 01:12:55.060
You've been hiding
everything from me.

01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:56.786
Why would you do this,

01:12:56.786 --> 01:13:00.134
knowing what would
happen if you get caught?

01:13:00.134 --> 01:13:01.722
- I, I don't know.

01:13:01.722 --> 01:13:03.586
I don't know.

01:13:03.586 --> 01:13:05.864
We're up to our
eyeballs in debt.

01:13:05.864 --> 01:13:07.210
And Greg came up with this plan.

01:13:07.210 --> 01:13:08.970
- There's no excuse.

01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:12.284
You have a great job, Michael.

01:13:12.284 --> 01:13:13.837
Baby, I know we have problems,

01:13:13.837 --> 01:13:16.495
but we're supposed to be a team.

01:13:21.707 --> 01:13:23.571
- You're right.

01:13:23.571 --> 01:13:24.676
You're right.

01:13:27.092 --> 01:13:30.509
We've been so divided
since we lost Jake.

01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:33.650
I didn't know how to,

01:13:33.650 --> 01:13:37.171
I didn't know what
to do or what to say.

01:13:37.171 --> 01:13:41.624
I thought I was just
doing the best I could.

01:13:41.624 --> 01:13:44.005
- This is no, no, no.

01:13:44.005 --> 01:13:45.351
No, Michael, no.

01:13:46.732 --> 01:13:49.459
That's you being stupid.

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:54.464
You're throwing away everything
that you worked so hard for.

01:13:55.638 --> 01:13:57.122
You went from a
drug-dealing teen

01:13:57.122 --> 01:14:00.815
to a potential VP of a major
pharmaceutical company.

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:05.302
Gregory is throwing
his life away.

01:14:07.235 --> 01:14:09.168
Baby, don't lose yours.

01:14:15.658 --> 01:14:16.486
Michael.

01:14:17.625 --> 01:14:18.799
Michael, wait.

01:14:22.734 --> 01:14:25.253
[phone beeps]

01:14:30.258 --> 01:14:33.365
[phone beeps]

01:14:33.365 --> 01:14:36.092
[ominous music]

01:14:48.173 --> 01:14:49.415
- Man, where have you been?

01:14:49.415 --> 01:14:50.209
I've been trying to
reach you all day.

01:14:50.209 --> 01:14:51.141
- None of that matters.

01:14:51.141 --> 01:14:52.660
Hey, what you doing here anyway?

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:57.665
- Man, they came to my house
and put a gun to my lady head.

01:14:58.148 --> 01:14:59.149
- Damn.

01:14:59.149 --> 01:15:00.496
- [Michael] Yeah.

01:15:03.464 --> 01:15:06.329
- You sure you want to do this?

01:15:06.329 --> 01:15:10.402
- When it come to protecting
my woman, hell yeah.

01:15:14.199 --> 01:15:17.133
- [Ricky] Well, well, well.

01:15:17.133 --> 01:15:18.065
- Let's go.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:23.726
- I don't appreciate you coming

01:15:23.726 --> 01:15:24.623
to my lady house like that.
- Not now.

01:15:24.623 --> 01:15:25.969
- Not now.

01:15:25.969 --> 01:15:27.488
- What?

01:15:27.488 --> 01:15:29.421
- You came to my house and
point a gun at my lady.

01:15:29.421 --> 01:15:31.423
That's some foul shit.

01:15:31.423 --> 01:15:33.425
What's funny, nigger.

01:15:33.425 --> 01:15:37.809
- Actually, I'm the one that
put the gun to her head.

01:15:38.741 --> 01:15:40.087
- You?

01:15:40.087 --> 01:15:43.055
- Man, but I thought
it was his house.

01:15:43.055 --> 01:15:44.954
That's the address he gave me.

01:15:44.954 --> 01:15:46.231
- What?

01:15:46.231 --> 01:15:49.234
- Y'all both dead anyway, man.

01:15:49.234 --> 01:15:50.476
You put that down.

01:15:50.476 --> 01:15:51.408
You ain't gonna pull.
- You can put your hands

01:15:51.408 --> 01:15:52.202
- [Michael] where I can see.

01:15:52.202 --> 01:15:53.134
- Man, put it down.

01:15:53.134 --> 01:15:54.411
- [Michael] I know what it is.

01:15:54.411 --> 01:15:55.585
Put your hands where I
can see them, nigger.

01:15:55.585 --> 01:15:56.552
- Scaredy-cat, what
you gonna do with that?

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:58.070
- Shut up, put your hands up.

01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:00.383
[gunshot explodes]
Oh, shit.

01:16:00.383 --> 01:16:01.349
Fuck, man.

01:16:01.349 --> 01:16:02.558
- What?

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:03.351
- What the fuck
you shoot them for?

01:16:03.351 --> 01:16:04.145
- Get the hell out.

01:16:04.145 --> 01:16:05.008
I was doing you a favor.

01:16:05.008 --> 01:16:06.285
I was doing you a favor.

01:16:06.285 --> 01:16:07.217
- I didn't need you
involved in any way.

01:16:07.217 --> 01:16:12.119
[fist thuds]
[Gregory groans]

01:16:12.913 --> 01:16:13.741
- Mike.

01:16:14.777 --> 01:16:15.847
[Ricky groans]

01:16:15.847 --> 01:16:16.675
Mike!

01:16:18.194 --> 01:16:19.022
- Fuck you.

01:16:19.022 --> 01:16:21.922
[gunshot explodes]

01:16:23.095 --> 01:16:25.753
[ominous music]

01:16:27.341 --> 01:16:30.413
- Mike, you better
answer your phone.

01:16:32.104 --> 01:16:33.865
I'm gonna find you.

01:16:33.865 --> 01:16:35.487
I'm gonna find you.

01:16:35.487 --> 01:16:37.351
You're gonna finish
what we started.

01:16:37.351 --> 01:16:38.352
You hear me?

01:16:40.216 --> 01:16:41.044
You gotta.

01:16:44.979 --> 01:16:47.326
[he laughs]

01:16:49.328 --> 01:16:51.607
What are you gonna do
with that gun, huh?

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.229
Huh, you're not
gonna do nothing.

01:16:53.229 --> 01:16:55.334
[gunshot explodes]

01:16:55.334 --> 01:16:58.165
[thunder rumbles]

01:16:59.407 --> 01:17:02.100
- [Tate] So you got
a update for me?

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:06.449
- I pushed the family and
friends a little bit more today.

01:17:06.449 --> 01:17:07.623
I don't know, man.

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:09.521
It doesn't seem
like they know much.

01:17:09.521 --> 01:17:12.869
[ominous music]

01:17:12.869 --> 01:17:14.146
- [Tate] I'm thinking that maybe

01:17:14.146 --> 01:17:17.563
you can get them to
turn on each other.

01:17:17.563 --> 01:17:19.669
- I don't know, maybe.

01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:21.119
- It's good work.

01:17:23.777 --> 01:17:24.640
Listen.

01:17:25.675 --> 01:17:26.538
- What?

01:17:28.022 --> 01:17:29.748
- Gregory was killed.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:31.750
- What?

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:33.269
- Then they got surveillance.

01:17:33.269 --> 01:17:34.097
- What?
- The whole thing.

01:17:34.097 --> 01:17:34.926
- Look.

01:17:39.171 --> 01:17:40.000
- Oh, no.

01:17:42.623 --> 01:17:43.451
Aw, fuck.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:47.732
- Come on, man, let's go.

01:17:47.732 --> 01:17:48.594
Let's go.

01:17:49.941 --> 01:17:52.115

[sirens wail]

01:17:59.605 --> 01:18:00.676
- Janet, baby.

01:18:02.298 --> 01:18:03.230
Baby, where are you?

01:18:03.230 --> 01:18:04.196
We gotta go.

01:18:04.196 --> 01:18:05.025
Janet.

01:18:06.129 --> 01:18:06.958
Janet.

Baby.

01:18:10.547 --> 01:18:11.548
Janet, Janet

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:17.554
Shit.

01:18:18.452 --> 01:18:19.280
Baby.

Baby, baby.
[doorbell rings]

01:18:23.837 --> 01:18:25.562
- [Digital Voice] Front door.

01:18:25.562 --> 01:18:28.255
- Are you, are you
okay, what's wrong?

01:18:28.255 --> 01:18:30.084
- Where have you been?

01:18:31.741 --> 01:18:34.813
- I'm gonna go take
care of Thug Life.

01:18:34.813 --> 01:18:36.332
- What did you do?

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.507
[sad music]

01:18:45.513 --> 01:18:47.653
- Greg killed him,

01:18:47.653 --> 01:18:49.863
and he tried to kill me,

01:18:49.863 --> 01:18:51.105
but we gotta go now.

01:18:51.105 --> 01:18:53.487
He might be on his
way back over here.

01:18:53.487 --> 01:18:54.315
Baby, what's wrong?

01:18:54.315 --> 01:18:55.834
We gotta go.

01:18:55.834 --> 01:18:57.284

Fuck.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:05.602
Fuck.

01:19:11.816 --> 01:19:14.991
- Everything's gonna
be fine, Michael.

01:19:16.579 --> 01:19:18.961
We'll get through this thing.

01:19:21.964 --> 01:19:25.174
I'll do anything to protect you.

01:19:25.174 --> 01:19:27.521

[sad, gentle music]

01:21:19.909 --> 01:21:21.497
- You're the reason

01:21:23.602 --> 01:21:24.707
in this mess.

01:21:27.641 --> 01:21:31.887
You're the reason
Michael is in this mess.

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:34.199
And I'm gonna free him.

[he cries]

01:21:38.272 --> 01:21:40.999
