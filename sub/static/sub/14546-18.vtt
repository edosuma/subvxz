00:12.151 --> 00:14.391

00:14.414 --> 00:15.134
(Laughs)

00:15.157 --> 00:16.917
Hey, you want a duck?

00:16.917 --> 00:18.457
<i>Steeper than the bath Butler...</i>

00:18.473 --> 00:19.658
Yes.

00:20.076 --> 00:22.809
<i>Steeper than the premium tuck-in service.</i>

00:23.135 --> 00:24.978
<i>- A price that, from under the drape...
- Mm.</i>

00:24.996 --> 00:26.787
<i>Of the custom blackout drapes,</i>

00:26.810 --> 00:28.765
he never saw coming.

00:37.809 --> 00:38.892
(Exhales)

00:39.807 --> 00:41.379
Whoa.

00:41.676 --> 00:43.303
He...hello... ladies.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.969
To what do I owe this... home invasion?

00:46.089 --> 00:48.605
Seriously, I haven't seen
the Chatswin mom militia

00:48.589 --> 00:50.028
out in force for quite some time.

00:50.036 --> 00:52.147
We're here about Opus. Opus Werner.

00:53.485 --> 00:54.916
Ah.

01:00.711 --> 01:01.737
Spot of tea, George?

01:02.150 --> 01:03.439
I'm good.

01:03.473 --> 01:05.206
Then I'll cut to the chase.

01:07.037 --> 01:09.735
Noah has Opus living like a pagan...

01:09.855 --> 01:11.291
in a hotel.

01:11.714 --> 01:12.433
So?

01:12.449 --> 01:14.851
Are you deliberately being
obtuse right now, George?

01:14.971 --> 01:17.244
Children should be raised in
a respectable 3-bedroom home.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.378
With a picket fence.

01:18.401 --> 01:19.535
And window boxes.

01:19.567 --> 01:22.210
Where Noah is living
is none of our business.

01:22.241 --> 01:24.635
And by ours, I mean yours.

01:24.755 --> 01:26.199
So maybe...

01:26.519 --> 01:27.442
stand down?

01:27.489 --> 01:29.233
Stand down? (Scoffs)

01:29.353 --> 01:30.633
I see.

01:30.672 --> 01:33.738
Did former Secretary of
State Hillary Rodham Clinton

01:33.754 --> 01:35.819
stand down when she penned her 1996

01:35.865 --> 01:37.555
"New York Times" bestseller?

01:38.157 --> 01:39.369
I'm... gonna guess "no"?

01:39.377 --> 01:42.051
It takes a village, George,
and we're the village people.

01:42.059 --> 01:43.687
Noah is going through a divorce.

01:43.726 --> 01:46.651
You have to give him time
to... iron out the details.

01:46.687 --> 01:48.582
Having raised a child as a single dad,

01:48.622 --> 01:50.741
<i>I assure you, it can be done.</i>

01:50.749 --> 01:53.572
Well, bravo to all you single parents.

01:53.588 --> 01:55.644
What an idiot I am.

01:55.652 --> 01:57.670
I struggled to keep my marriage intact,

01:57.670 --> 02:00.055
gave up any theoretical,
exciting career plans,

02:00.055 --> 02:02.542
and stayed home to cook
meals for my children.

02:02.558 --> 02:04.490
But apparently, I could
have been raising them

02:04.513 --> 02:05.366
on room service.

02:05.389 --> 02:07.337
You know what? I...I
appreciate your concern,

02:07.329 --> 02:09.158
and I'm sure Noah does, too. But...

02:09.190 --> 02:12.271
This is more than concern.

02:12.391 --> 02:14.993
If you won't do something,
the village people will.

Well, that's what I need you to tell me.

02:47.075 --> 02:50.054
It all started this morning

02:51.524 --> 02:52.822
Have a great day.

03:01.339 --> 03:02.379
Oh, yeah?

03:02.499 --> 03:05.156
<i>Well, there's something I want.</i>

03:07.275 --> 03:09.035
I don't know if I wanna hear this story.

03:09.082 --> 03:10.810
Oh, are you worried there's gonna be sex?

03:11.045 --> 03:13.876
Don't be. There's never any
sex in any of my stories.

03:13.883 --> 03:16.902
There's an opening, Fred,
a really juicy opening.

03:16.902 --> 03:18.380
I want you to move on it

03:18.419 --> 03:21.188
and slide in there
before someone else does.

03:22.087 --> 03:23.487
This is it, Fred.

03:23.526 --> 03:26.013
This is your chance to
get back on the sales team

03:26.005 --> 03:26.896
where you belong.

03:26.896 --> 03:29.039
Oh, but, Sheila, sales is so cutthroat,

03:29.086 --> 03:30.189
competitive.

03:30.212 --> 03:32.003
As a junior secretary,
I know where I stand.

03:32.035 --> 03:33.106
My blood pressure's down.

03:33.098 --> 03:34.623
I even have my own catchphrase...

03:34.670 --> 03:36.422
"Anybody need anything?"

03:36.453 --> 03:38.619
That's not a catchphrase.
That's the sound a man makes

03:38.619 --> 03:40.426
when he's bringing home
half the salary he used to.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.710
Now you take this Waldorf salad sandwich

03:42.733 --> 03:44.430
and you go get that job!

03:44.430 --> 03:46.174
Go get it! Go get 'em!

03:46.526 --> 03:47.652
Go get 'em!

03:47.660 --> 03:49.146
Okay.

03:49.185 --> 03:49.975
Seriously, go get it.

03:50.014 --> 03:51.499
- Go. Go get it.
- Oh. Sorry. Right.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.728
Okay. Well, then what are you doing here?

03:53.752 --> 03:55.918
It sounds like you should
be out getting that job.

03:55.918 --> 03:57.123
Well, I want to.

03:57.138 --> 03:58.311
But the new sales manager, Todd,

03:58.343 --> 04:00.345
thinks anyone over 30 is a dinosaur.

04:00.353 --> 04:01.503
Now I know what you're thinking...

04:01.503 --> 04:03.497
dinosaurs are awesome. Agreed.

04:03.617 --> 04:06.023
But apparently, in Todd's world, not so.

04:06.328 --> 04:09.433
Please, Tessa. He's young
and he's from Manhattan.

04:09.621 --> 04:11.373
Teach me your urban ways.

04:11.357 --> 04:13.867
(Huffs) I don't really have any "ways."

04:14.079 --> 04:16.769
Well, then, at least tell me
what I need to feel current.

04:16.784 --> 04:17.839
Uh...

04:17.848 --> 04:19.755
Oh... do... do I need one of these?

04:19.810 --> 04:20.921
If your phone is dying.

04:20.937 --> 04:22.540
Okay, well, let's just assume that it is.

04:22.595 --> 04:25.895
Uh, Mr. shay, instead of demonstrating

04:25.895 --> 04:27.647
your phone-charging capabilities,

04:27.663 --> 04:31.353
have you considered emphasizing
your vast sales experience?

04:31.346 --> 04:32.965
(Chuckles) Sales experience?

04:34.044 --> 04:35.217
(Sighs)

04:35.233 --> 04:38.572
Judy Walker was the most
experienced sales rep we had.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.841
She got fired because she
didn't know who Katie Holmes was.

04:41.873 --> 04:44.883
And God save my wretched
soul, Tessa, neither do I.

04:45.003 --> 04:47.410
Please. You have to help me.

04:47.605 --> 04:51.015
Well, I... do know who Katie Holmes is.

04:51.054 --> 04:53.713
I knew it! Thank you, lord.

05:08.494 --> 05:09.886
What's the problem, mommy?

05:09.933 --> 05:13.070
Dalia, this closet is bursting at the seams

05:13.092 --> 05:15.258
like a Christina Aguilera dress,

05:15.292 --> 05:16.791
which is not a comment on her weight,

05:16.823 --> 05:18.778
but rather on the tightness of her attire.

05:18.809 --> 05:21.063
I know. She really crams it in there.

05:21.131 --> 05:22.892
Just like me with my closet.

05:22.892 --> 05:24.026
I need a bigger one.

05:24.034 --> 05:26.912
We have enlarged the closets
in your room four times already,

05:26.896 --> 05:28.515
and they were generous to begin with.

05:28.539 --> 05:29.868
Enough is enough.

05:29.884 --> 05:31.722
It's just my stuff, mommy.

05:31.722 --> 05:34.170
Dalia, this closet is an embarrassment.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.688
And you're gonna spend the
rest of the day organizing it,

05:36.688 --> 05:39.566
do you hear me? Now if
you need storage space,

05:39.761 --> 05:41.935
you can always put some
things under your...

05:42.055 --> 05:44.806
<i>(Gasps) (Laughter)</i>

05:45.009 --> 05:46.737
Dalia Oprah...

05:46.857 --> 05:48.011
you're a hoarder.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.873
Get out of my room.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.095
What's in the trunk?

05:54.213 --> 05:55.347
Don't. Mommy, no.

05:55.363 --> 05:57.240
Aah! Aah!

05:57.485 --> 05:58.991
Look at all these purses!

05:59.111 --> 06:01.337
Who in their right mind
needs this many purses?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.878
(Demonic voice) I do.

06:03.433 --> 06:05.638
(Gasps) Look here, Dalia!

06:05.646 --> 06:07.171
There is a very thin line

06:07.187 --> 06:08.843
between you and those cray-cray people

06:08.852 --> 06:10.510
who live in homes full of newspaper.

06:10.542 --> 06:12.200
And just 'cause these items are expensive

06:12.207 --> 06:14.303
doesn't change the fact
that you're hoarding them.

06:14.423 --> 06:17.509
And hoarding is greedy and
ungracious. You hear me?

06:17.564 --> 06:19.394
It's time to make some tough decisions.

06:19.514 --> 06:22.021
You need to get rid of all
the stuff that you don't need,

06:22.141 --> 06:23.810
or I'll do it for you.

06:25.971 --> 06:28.262
Well, I just stopped by to, you know,

06:28.278 --> 06:29.748
see how everybody's doing.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.055
Never better, George. (Bottle cap fizzes)

06:32.055 --> 06:33.783
Never better. (Nipple squeaks)

06:33.903 --> 06:37.020
This place is not only
meeting our needs... (Cooing)

06:37.140 --> 06:39.304
it is anticipating our wants...

06:39.758 --> 06:42.104
around-the-clock room service,

06:42.224 --> 06:43.488
in-room massage,

06:43.608 --> 06:44.958
twice-a-day maid service,

06:44.950 --> 06:46.077
and the best part about it,

06:46.100 --> 06:47.946
I'm putting it all on my platinum card.

06:48.368 --> 06:49.776
Miles, George.

06:49.799 --> 06:51.402
Great. Great.

06:51.449 --> 06:54.718
(Opus coos) But, uh, what...
what's the long-term plan?

06:54.976 --> 06:57.197
I mean, you can't... you
can't live in a hotel forever.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.105
Or can I?

06:59.225 --> 07:00.927
Howard Hughes did so quite nicely,

07:00.974 --> 07:02.526
as did James Woods.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.261
Khloe and Lamar.

07:04.295 --> 07:07.058
Right, but they weren't
raising small children.

07:07.105 --> 07:09.123
Right. Well...

07:09.601 --> 07:13.103
God's honest, I'm... not
entirely liquid at the moment.

07:13.103 --> 07:14.871
I'm having some cash flow issues.

07:15.105 --> 07:17.389
(Chuckles) Mommy and her divorce lawyer

07:17.381 --> 07:18.923
- haven't missed a trick.
- (Knock on door)

07:19.618 --> 07:21.690
(Cooing)

07:23.520 --> 07:25.449
Where are my nuggets?

07:26.187 --> 07:29.050
I'm sorry, Mr. Werner, but
it has come to my attention

07:29.050 --> 07:30.443
that you've been conducting yourself

07:30.435 --> 07:32.327
in a manner that makes it impossible

07:32.320 --> 07:34.689
for you to continue to
stay at our facility.

07:34.809 --> 07:36.348
Whoa. What's he talking about?

07:36.468 --> 07:39.030
- I have no idea.
- Don't you?

07:39.343 --> 07:43.355
He's been romancing more than
one member of our service staff.

07:44.937 --> 07:46.475
You've been having sex with housekeeping?

07:46.491 --> 07:48.938
- Absolutely not!
- I did not say those words.

07:48.993 --> 07:51.199
I said he was "romancing" them...

07:51.319 --> 07:53.387
- Which he has been.
- Come on!

07:53.688 --> 07:55.827
I'm not allowed to tell Rosa...

07:56.415 --> 07:57.442
That I love her?

07:57.562 --> 07:59.613
No, sir. No, you are not,

07:59.733 --> 08:02.379
particularly if you're going to
say the same thing to Marilyn.

08:02.379 --> 08:04.044
But I do love Marilyn.

08:04.164 --> 08:05.408
I love them both.

08:05.420 --> 08:08.023
And I love Dottie for bringing
me fresh pineapple by the pool.

08:08.036 --> 08:10.439
And I love Cynthia. Oh, my God, I love her.

08:10.470 --> 08:12.372
She makes my dinner
reservation every night at 7:00.

08:12.397 --> 08:14.974
The service floor is in chaos, sir.

08:15.094 --> 08:16.976
Fighting. Hair-pulling.

08:17.096 --> 08:18.515
Tears.

08:19.310 --> 08:22.382
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to invite you to leave.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.745
Wait a minute.

08:23.865 --> 08:26.636
Okay, you're kicking me out
for loving the service here?

08:26.674 --> 08:27.593
Precisely right.

08:28.037 --> 08:30.796
I've taken the liberty
of preparing your bill.

08:34.525 --> 08:35.370
Whoa!

08:35.408 --> 08:38.129
Yeah. But as I said, I get the miles.

08:38.249 --> 08:42.347
Still, that is really a lot.

Listen, I love a good V.V.
as much as the next juicer.

08:59.715 --> 09:01.217
Don't say "juicer."

09:01.429 --> 09:02.674
I love a good V. V...

09:02.681 --> 09:04.282
Wait. What's a V.V. again?

09:04.282 --> 09:06.572
Viral video, right? I
thought you taught me that.

09:06.591 --> 09:08.588
No. I've never heard that phrase.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.227
But it's fine. Continue.

09:10.347 --> 09:12.254
(Crunching) Okay. Um, right.

09:12.566 --> 09:15.026
I love a good V.V. as
much as the next web head,

09:15.026 --> 09:16.715
but that jam was fin

09:16.734 --> 09:18.923
as soon as it left Gangnam. Opp?

09:19.261 --> 09:19.774
Opp?

09:19.787 --> 09:21.501
It's from the song. I think it's Korean.

09:21.514 --> 09:22.740
Anyway... opp?

09:22.771 --> 09:25.074
Then I whip out my
charger, charge my phone,

09:25.074 --> 09:26.125
and I close with,

09:26.182 --> 09:28.759
<i>Chatswin is so ghetto.</i>

09:28.879 --> 09:31.268
Uh... honestly,

09:31.468 --> 09:33.395
I don't think we're quite there.

09:33.439 --> 09:35.454
How much time do we have?

09:35.485 --> 09:38.101
None. I've got 15
minutes to wheely to work.

09:38.138 --> 09:41.754
All right. Um, maybe just lose the wheelys,

09:41.804 --> 09:44.569
and change "ghetto" to "midtown."

09:44.757 --> 09:46.503
And get a little
bacitracin for that earlobe.

09:46.547 --> 09:48.411
All right. Thanks.

09:51.426 --> 09:53.310
- Mommy.
- (Gasps)

09:53.841 --> 09:55.418
What are you doing with my lambo?

09:55.406 --> 09:58.195
Dalia, step off. I told you point-blank

09:58.208 --> 10:00.315
if you didn't fill those
boxes I left in your room,

10:00.341 --> 10:01.442
I'd fill 'em for you.

10:01.562 --> 10:03.100
Now I'm just getting
rid of the kid stuff...

10:03.132 --> 10:04.883
things you haven't touched in years.

10:04.940 --> 10:06.285
<i>You haven't been touched in years.</i>

10:06.686 --> 10:08.168
Dalia, you're lashing out.

10:08.212 --> 10:09.864
That's my first lambo, mommy.

10:09.858 --> 10:11.478
It only has 10,000 miles on it.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.804
You can't give it away.

10:12.804 --> 10:15.520
And I bet you'd say the same
thing about your play mansion...

10:15.501 --> 10:18.192
- I would.
- And those two toddler-size helicopters

10:18.192 --> 10:19.301
- parked on the roof.
- Mm-hmm.

10:19.299 --> 10:21.746
But those items would make
very charitable donations.

10:21.771 --> 10:23.961
I don't see you giving
any of your stuff away.

10:23.992 --> 10:27.113
Not so. Look at those
boxes by the front door.

10:27.132 --> 10:29.666
I'm gettin' rid of all
my adult dress-up clothes.

10:29.786 --> 10:31.543
George isn't into role-playing,

10:31.568 --> 10:35.097
so I no longer need my
crotchless firefighter outfit.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.655
Now it's your turn to
get rid of some things

10:37.674 --> 10:39.232
that you haven't played with,

10:39.352 --> 10:41.009
like that lambo...

10:41.028 --> 10:42.198
I'm playing with it, mommy.

10:42.248 --> 10:43.894
I'm playing with it right now.

10:44.014 --> 10:46.189
(Whirring)

10:46.509 --> 10:47.397
(Noah) George!

10:47.447 --> 10:48.217
Yeah?

10:48.267 --> 10:49.268
Again, buddy,

10:49.262 --> 10:52.184
I can't thank you enough
for agreeing to put us up.

10:52.722 --> 10:54.843
Yeah. No... no problem, man.

10:54.887 --> 10:57.095
I just wanna see you get back on your feet.

10:57.296 --> 10:59.323
Yes. I cannot wait to get off my feet.

10:59.373 --> 11:00.211
Oh.

11:00.331 --> 11:02.851
Right. Okay, well, you
know where the kitchen is.

11:02.882 --> 11:03.715
Help yourself.

11:03.771 --> 11:05.279
Just let us know what's on your lunch menu,

11:05.298 --> 11:06.598
and any lighter fare you might have

11:06.598 --> 11:08.231
for when we're playing outside.

11:08.275 --> 11:10.327
The pull-out couch is all made up for you.

11:11.241 --> 11:13.262
Look at that.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.802
We're gonna be as comfy
as a couple of motel 6-ers.

11:15.846 --> 11:17.616
Hmm? Yeah. Ow.

11:18.123 --> 11:19.962
Something wrong? (Opus coos)

11:20.082 --> 11:21.589
No. (Smacks lips)

11:21.908 --> 11:24.042
All right, I'm a little worried

11:24.104 --> 11:26.238
that Opus and I might bleed to death

11:26.450 --> 11:28.125
from the million little cuts

11:28.245 --> 11:30.430
that we're going to get
from these rough sheets.

11:30.614 --> 11:32.476
Look, we've already been through so much.

11:32.707 --> 11:34.384
Fine. I'll see what else we have.

11:34.397 --> 11:37.581
So we're looking for someone
who understands young urbanites.

11:37.701 --> 11:39.583
Our product targets twenty-somethings

11:39.613 --> 11:41.177
who struggle with lethargy during the day,

11:41.227 --> 11:43.211
caused by insomnia at night.

11:43.261 --> 11:45.031
Sleep when we're dead. Am I right?

11:45.056 --> 11:46.376
I hope not.

11:46.814 --> 11:49.466
Uh, their circadian rhythms
are being confused by...

11:49.466 --> 11:50.492
Arcade Fire.

11:50.705 --> 11:52.094
- What?
- 'Cause I know what that is.

11:52.094 --> 11:53.639
And that is a band. (Chuckles)

11:53.658 --> 11:56.618
Right. But it's not Arcade Fire.

11:56.806 --> 11:57.876
Uh, our research shows it's...

11:57.895 --> 11:59.565
Katie Holmes? Katie Bosworth?

11:59.753 --> 12:01.642
Katie Middleton? Katie Upton?

12:01.762 --> 12:02.787
Cat Daddy? Wanna Cat Daddy?

12:02.775 --> 12:05.784
♪

12:06.021 --> 12:06.828
No.

12:06.948 --> 12:09.143
Uh, I...I do not. I don't.

12:09.169 --> 12:10.195
Oh? Yeah.

12:10.264 --> 12:11.227
Okay.

12:11.347 --> 12:13.236
Um, anyways, it's light.

12:13.356 --> 12:16.377
Oh. Ooh. Yeah. Light from
cell phones and monitors,

12:16.383 --> 12:17.459
and various other gadgets,

12:17.497 --> 12:19.680
which is exactly how
we intend to reach them,

12:19.686 --> 12:20.894
through our social media campaign.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.877
- O.M.G.
- Yeah.

12:22.997 --> 12:25.554
I can't believe you just
said "social media campaign."

12:25.598 --> 12:27.901
Because I'm antisocial socially,

12:27.888 --> 12:30.566
but I'm super social social-medially.

12:30.686 --> 12:33.794
Uh, in fact, I would say
social media is my main...

12:33.794 --> 12:34.864
Hey, hold on. Do you mind

12:34.883 --> 12:37.098
if I just charge my phone real quick?

12:37.536 --> 12:39.157
- I just wanna charge it all up...
- Yeah.

12:39.169 --> 12:41.553
- 'Cause dead phones are ghetto.
- (Beeps)

12:41.591 --> 12:42.598
Sure.

12:42.611 --> 12:43.868
Yeah. Anyway, where were we?

12:43.893 --> 12:46.177
You were saying how active
you are on social media.

12:46.184 --> 12:47.560
- Mm.
- So you tweet?

12:47.610 --> 12:49.262
Like a brown trembler.

12:49.475 --> 12:51.762
Great. Well, you're
obviously very experienced

12:51.764 --> 12:53.071
in the pharmaceutical sales field,

12:53.053 --> 12:55.192
- Yep. Mm-hmm.
- And I can see you're extremely passionate.

12:55.205 --> 12:56.219
Oh, yeah.

12:56.339 --> 12:57.520
Todd, I love you,

12:57.526 --> 12:59.760
<i>and I will love on you if I get this job,</i>

12:59.785 --> 13:01.687
<i>which I would love... (Laughs)</i>

13:01.807 --> 13:03.314
Okay. Bro.

13:03.345 --> 13:05.266
Okay. Well, how about this...

13:05.210 --> 13:07.450
I will follow you on Twitter,

13:07.494 --> 13:08.814
and if I like what I see,

13:09.633 --> 13:12.135
uh, you'll hear something
by the end of the week.

13:12.169 --> 13:13.155
(Gasps)

13:13.174 --> 13:14.704
(Gulps)

13:24.455 --> 13:25.712
There.

13:25.737 --> 13:28.890
Now, instead of lookin' at
herself bathed in prosperity,

13:28.940 --> 13:30.905
Dalia can gaze upon Fatmire...

13:30.974 --> 13:33.045
an Albanian orphan who has nothin'.

13:33.063 --> 13:33.901
Oh.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.565
Imagine what a girl like Fatmire

13:35.596 --> 13:36.886
would do with that toy lambo.

13:36.924 --> 13:38.375
Uh, drag it into the next village

13:38.369 --> 13:39.752
and trade it for clean water?

13:39.820 --> 13:40.634
Hmm.

13:41.084 --> 13:43.694
Seems like a lot of
legwork for poor Fatmire.

13:43.725 --> 13:45.083
You know what, baby? I think it's great

13:45.101 --> 13:47.553
that you're trying to educate Dalia

13:47.572 --> 13:49.868
about those less fortunate
and curb the excess.

13:49.868 --> 13:51.683
Maybe when you're done
here, you can talk to Noah.

13:51.701 --> 13:53.347
His lifestyle is insane.

13:53.378 --> 13:54.617
And the worst part of it is,

13:54.673 --> 13:56.644
he expects everyone else to cater to him.

13:56.675 --> 13:58.802
This is the second run
I've made for new sheets.

13:58.821 --> 14:00.473
Apparently, the ones I bought yesterday...

14:00.541 --> 14:02.237
they weren't up to his lofty standards.

14:02.268 --> 14:04.442
Careful. Those are gateway sheets.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.629
That's exactly how it started with Dalia.

14:06.664 --> 14:08.362
At first it was small things...

14:08.482 --> 14:11.377
designer diapers, toddler tanning bed,

14:11.408 --> 14:13.899
then the next thing you know,
you're standing in J.F.K.,

14:13.911 --> 14:15.594
trying to explain to U.S. customs

14:15.600 --> 14:18.159
why you're smuggling
half a dozen baby leopards

14:18.178 --> 14:19.173
into the country...

14:19.229 --> 14:21.432
none of whom survived the flight.

14:21.438 --> 14:22.858
So heed my warning

14:22.978 --> 14:24.304
and draw some boundaries.

14:24.424 --> 14:26.605
I know, but my heart goes out to the guy.

14:26.887 --> 14:28.132
You remember how tough it is

14:28.157 --> 14:30.028
when you first start doing it on your own.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.705
I do, but the sooner he can stand

14:31.736 --> 14:33.438
on his own two feet, the better.

14:33.882 --> 14:35.165
You taught me that.

14:35.641 --> 14:36.579
- Did I?
- Mm-hmm.

14:36.892 --> 14:37.987
You know what? You are right.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.139
I...I thought I was helping him,

14:40.139 --> 14:42.223
but really, I'm... I'm just enabling him.

14:42.286 --> 14:45.859
And you need to disable him
like I'm about to disable Dalia.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.762
Hey, you want me to send
these sheets to Fatmire?

14:48.787 --> 14:49.425
Um...

14:49.450 --> 14:52.841
you know, for a 14-year-old girl,

14:52.904 --> 14:55.881
she looks a hell of a lot
like Alan Rickman, doesn't she?

15:00.124 --> 15:01.369
(Whispers) Psst. Tessa.

15:01.425 --> 15:03.652
(Chuckles) Big news.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.474
Todd is following me.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.782
- That's great.
- Yeah. I'm one step closer.

15:08.082 --> 15:08.846
Congrats.

15:08.966 --> 15:10.616
I owe it all to you.

15:10.736 --> 15:11.749
I'm trying to study.

15:11.805 --> 15:13.300
Okay, well, study me. Study this.

15:13.362 --> 15:15.439
Look, Mr. Shay, I was
late to school yesterday

15:15.464 --> 15:16.672
trying to help you prepare,

15:16.666 --> 15:19.713
and now I'm trying to make up
for the work I missed, so...

15:19.932 --> 15:21.108
How 'bout this?

15:21.146 --> 15:22.696
You help me tweet something awesome,

15:22.703 --> 15:24.317
and you'll never have to
work a day in your life.

15:24.329 --> 15:26.431
If I get this job, all
your needs will be met.

15:26.437 --> 15:29.284
I wanna meet my own
needs, and so should you.

15:29.404 --> 15:31.455
(Sighs) Okay. Well, at least let me know

15:31.448 --> 15:33.088
what you think of my tweet
so far. (Paper rustles)

15:33.438 --> 15:35.471
"Something, something, #awesome," space,

15:35.490 --> 15:37.786
"#youknowi'mright!"

15:38.800 --> 15:41.014
I'm still circling what "#awesome" thing

15:41.058 --> 15:44.218
I might be right about, now
it's either phone chargers,

15:44.249 --> 15:46.570
midtown, or colace, which is a fantastic

15:46.576 --> 15:48.178
♪water-based stool softener.

15:48.935 --> 15:50.359
Can I ask you something?

15:50.749 --> 15:52.708
What if you get this job? What then?

15:53.390 --> 15:56.149
What if you convince Todd

15:56.161 --> 15:58.214
that you are a media-savvy hipster

15:58.226 --> 15:59.502
with a fully charged phone

15:59.508 --> 16:02.157
and... the softest B.Ms in midtown?

16:02.568 --> 16:04.175
How you gonna keep it up?

16:04.295 --> 16:05.321
I just will.

16:05.966 --> 16:06.828
(Door closes)

16:07.173 --> 16:08.830
(George) Noah?

16:09.164 --> 16:11.573
There he is! My sheets man!

16:11.760 --> 16:13.156
What the hell happened in here?

16:13.174 --> 16:15.433
Oh. I ordered in.

16:15.458 --> 16:16.503
It's just like room service,

16:16.515 --> 16:18.217
except no one comes to clear it away.

16:18.254 --> 16:20.525
So I'm calling a trash removal service.

16:20.519 --> 16:22.346
They should be here within the hour.

16:22.466 --> 16:24.817
Anything you wanna get rid of?
They have a 45-pound minimum.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.093
How much do you weigh?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.432
Is that a fat joke?

16:27.620 --> 16:29.334
Because I bought this for everyone.

16:29.328 --> 16:30.854
No. Look, man, I...

16:31.042 --> 16:33.338
I...I feel like I'm doing you a disservice.

16:33.458 --> 16:35.127
Well, I wasn't gonna complain,

16:35.140 --> 16:38.074
but I did expect you hours
ago with those sheets.

16:38.124 --> 16:40.364
I wanted to give you someplace to crash,

16:40.383 --> 16:42.867
but you're crash-and-burning.
You need to get it together.

16:42.890 --> 16:46.927
You need to step up and find
some place where Opus can sleep

16:46.960 --> 16:49.430
where he's not gonna get
banana peppers on him.

16:50.024 --> 16:50.963
(Scoffs)

16:51.083 --> 16:53.833
I'm not saying it has to have
a picket fence and a window box,

16:53.867 --> 16:55.334
but something.

16:55.369 --> 16:57.003
Figure it out.

16:57.037 --> 16:58.171
So what are you saying?

16:58.205 --> 16:59.640
I'm saying I think you should go.

16:59.673 --> 17:02.643
There it is. Wow. Unbelievable.

17:02.925 --> 17:04.589
I'm sorry... remind me again,

17:04.645 --> 17:06.428
who was there for you when Alex left?

17:06.810 --> 17:09.188
My downstairs neighbor, Rob Buchman.

17:09.308 --> 17:10.545
<i>That's right.</i>

17:10.558 --> 17:13.598
Rob Buchman. That's been driving me crazy.

17:13.718 --> 17:15.618
<i>(Laughs) Maybe I should call him!</i>

17:15.686 --> 17:17.190
Maybe you should.

17:17.691 --> 17:18.779
Fine.

17:19.010 --> 17:20.707
Why don't you give me the
name of your packing service

17:20.712 --> 17:23.329
and pull my car around, and
we'll get out of your hair?

17:34.557 --> 17:35.833
<i>Letting go of your childhood</i>

17:35.858 --> 17:38.943
<i>is a necessary step
towards becoming an adult.</i>

17:39.487 --> 17:41.420
All right.

17:41.540 --> 17:44.549
<i>And becoming an adult is a necessary step</i>

17:44.586 --> 17:46.169
<i>when you are parenting a child.</i>

17:46.569 --> 17:49.279
This is teamwork. Good job, buddy.

17:49.298 --> 17:52.176
<i>But when the lines get blurry,
and you find yourself parenting</i>

17:52.195 --> 17:54.053
<i>your middle-aged next-door neighbor...</i>

17:54.173 --> 17:55.192
(Doorbell rings)

17:55.235 --> 17:57.569
<i>The next step is a little less clear.</i>

17:57.557 --> 17:58.827
- Tessa.
- Mr. Shay.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.128
I found your wheelys on the curb,

18:00.128 --> 18:01.767
and I didn't know what to think.

18:02.192 --> 18:05.595
But it looks like you're
back to your old self again.

18:06.152 --> 18:07.178
You followed my advice.

18:07.184 --> 18:08.780
No. I did no such thing.

18:09.018 --> 18:10.694
I fell down three flights of stairs

18:10.737 --> 18:13.278
on those infernal contraptions
and broke Todd's collarbone.

18:13.284 --> 18:15.367
One of my earholes developed a keloid,

18:15.380 --> 18:17.013
and I didn't get the promotion.

18:17.188 --> 18:20.053
But the good news is,
I lost my existing job...

18:20.103 --> 18:21.661
as well as a portion of my earlobe.

18:21.781 --> 18:22.949
That's the good news?

18:23.069 --> 18:26.433
Yes. Because my loss was Sheila's gain.

18:26.553 --> 18:28.980
She grew like a wild carrot

18:29.100 --> 18:32.233
in the fertile dung of my failure.

18:32.627 --> 18:34.197
More failure, Fred?

18:34.254 --> 18:35.805
I'm sorry. Filet.

18:35.805 --> 18:38.089
Of sole... crushing failure.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.467
Yes, please.

18:40.587 --> 18:41.712
(Scrapes)

18:41.832 --> 18:43.976
I'm sorry I didn't get the job.

18:44.096 --> 18:46.548
<i>I'm not like you. I don't have your fury.</i>

18:46.668 --> 18:48.393
You're a lioness. And I'm...

18:48.456 --> 18:50.189
The guys who gets the
coffee for the lioness?

18:50.309 --> 18:51.290
Exactly.

18:51.410 --> 18:53.192
Say, maybe you should
stay home with the kids,

18:53.198 --> 18:55.306
and I should join the workforce.

18:55.375 --> 18:56.526
Are you trying to have it all?

18:56.576 --> 18:58.604
Because I thought we'd agreed
that we'd each have some.

18:58.648 --> 19:00.687
Oh, come on, Fred, you said it yourself...

19:00.700 --> 19:02.239
I'm a lioness.

19:02.359 --> 19:05.687
Maybe I should be
bringing home the gazelle.

19:05.862 --> 19:07.858
And what would I do?

19:07.978 --> 19:09.679
Come up with a side dish for gazelle.

19:10.592 --> 19:12.807
<i>You don't really need
a side dish for gazelle.</i>

19:12.863 --> 19:15.153
It's a very rich, flavorful meat.

19:15.273 --> 19:17.368
But I'm doing a minted
couscous, nonetheless.

19:17.488 --> 19:18.989
Well, that sounds delightful.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.666
Oh, it will be.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.373
I've never been happier.

19:22.493 --> 19:23.793
Sheila's out pounding the pavement,

19:23.806 --> 19:26.515
and I'm home pounding
the cutlets. (Chuckles)

19:26.635 --> 19:28.304
I even let my phone die...

19:28.424 --> 19:30.181
along with my dreams. (Chuckles)

19:30.301 --> 19:33.065
J.K. #notreally.

19:33.963 --> 19:35.104
(Pounds)

19:35.110 --> 19:36.543
Dalia, I'm impressed.

19:36.663 --> 19:39.434
You scaled way back and got organized.

19:39.554 --> 19:40.566
Yeah.

19:40.572 --> 19:43.658
And I found a lot of things I
was missing when I cleaned up.

19:45.247 --> 19:46.661
Like penuche.

19:46.711 --> 19:48.945
Oh, my gosh. He looks hungry.

19:48.951 --> 19:50.021
He shouldn't be.

19:50.052 --> 19:52.900
He ate 15 pairs of my espadrilles...

19:52.931 --> 19:56.047
not that I needed 15 pairs of espadrilles.

19:56.078 --> 19:57.736
Exactly. Thattagirl.

19:58.421 --> 20:01.765
Now can we take down the
portrait of Alan Rickman?

20:10.300 --> 20:13.628
(Blender whirring)

20:16.272 --> 20:17.739
(Whirring stops)

20:18.157 --> 20:19.690
Hi, neighbor!

20:22.355 --> 20:23.519
(Sighs)

20:27.798 --> 20:30.539
Noah? What... what's going on?

20:30.789 --> 20:33.254
(Whirring resumes) Margaritas!
That's what's going on!

20:33.374 --> 20:35.400
(Laughs) (Whirring stops)

20:35.581 --> 20:37.514
I'm having a housewarming. (Lid clangs)

20:37.565 --> 20:41.651
O-okay, but you... you know,
you can't live in a playhouse.

20:41.951 --> 20:46.537
One man's playhouse is
another man's real house.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.546
- Okay.
- Peter Dinklage said that.

20:50.278 --> 20:54.433
J.K... Peter Dinklage lives
in a normal-sized house.

20:54.426 --> 20:57.573
(Sighs) Anyway, I found a sublet.

20:57.542 --> 20:58.987
We're moving in next week.

20:59.012 --> 21:00.507
It has its own washer and dryer,

21:00.507 --> 21:02.672
so apparently Opus and I

21:02.666 --> 21:06.776
will be learning how to
use a washer and dryer.

21:07.114 --> 21:10.011
Well, if Rob Buchman
doesn't return your call,

21:10.029 --> 21:11.531
I'd be happy to teach you.

21:11.762 --> 21:15.153
I've kind of become a...a
laundry expert over the years.

21:15.222 --> 21:17.493
Do you mind if I leave
this playhouse here...

21:17.962 --> 21:19.989
For Opus, until I get my own yard?

21:20.058 --> 21:21.478
Of, course, man.

21:21.598 --> 21:23.324
(Car horn honks)

21:25.933 --> 21:28.310
(Whirring)

21:28.344 --> 21:31.308
Probably shouldn't let him drink and drive.

21:31.483 --> 21:33.379
I'm teasing. It's non-alcoholic.

21:33.392 --> 21:36.551
Don't tell him. He likes
to feel like a big man.
