39:42.249 --> 39:45.252
Okay, there is something
I have to tell you.

39:45.295 --> 39:47.428
[ Exasperated sigh ]

39:47.472 --> 39:48.342
Jack offered.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.256
Offered what?

39:49.299 --> 39:51.606
His sperm.

39:51.650 --> 39:53.782
When?

39:53.826 --> 39:55.697
It was practically
a joke.

39:55.741 --> 39:57.960
He was like, "Um, I have extra
if you need some."

39:58.004 --> 39:59.440
And he took it
immediately back,

39:59.484 --> 40:00.876
like,
"It's a dumb thing to say."

40:00.920 --> 40:02.791
Because it is.
Exactly.

40:02.835 --> 40:06.186
You tell your grandma that you
get one bedtime story, not two.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.361
No, two!

40:07.405 --> 40:08.841
No, one.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.582
No, three!

40:10.625 --> 40:12.714
Jack: Ooh, ooh.
Me, me, me.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.194
I wanna say hi.

40:14.237 --> 40:15.804
Come on.

40:15.848 --> 40:17.415
Hi, Uncle Jack.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.242
Hi, Pru.

40:19.286 --> 40:20.983
Guess what?
What?

40:21.027 --> 40:23.029
Chicken butt.

40:23.072 --> 40:25.248
I have no idea
who taught her that.Yeah.

[ Breathing heavily ]

40:29.818 --> 40:31.820
Herrera?
What happened?

40:31.864 --> 40:34.432
I lost a life.

40:34.475 --> 40:36.216
A life that could have been
saved if the PRT

40:36.259 --> 40:38.305
hadn't been shut down
by people without a vision

40:38.348 --> 40:39.915
who prioritized protocols

40:39.959 --> 40:42.788
and avoided lawsuits
over human life.

40:42.831 --> 40:46.531
Captain Aquino is expected
to return in a month or so,

40:46.574 --> 40:48.358
and after some careful thought,
I --

40:48.402 --> 40:52.580
You feel like you should be made
captain of 23 permanently.

40:52.624 --> 40:54.843
No.

40:54.887 --> 40:56.584
The team
my father put together

40:56.628 --> 40:58.978
has spearheaded programs

40:59.021 --> 41:01.459
that are saving taxpayers
thousands of dollars a year

41:01.502 --> 41:03.243
and are changing this city
for the better.

41:03.286 --> 41:07.290
Crisis One, the clinic, PRT,
which I want to fight for.

41:07.334 --> 41:09.858
I want to fight for the PRT,
but it's not my place,

41:09.902 --> 41:12.513
'cause 19's not my house,
but it should be.

41:12.557 --> 41:15.385
I was able to make some changes
during my time as captain at 23,

41:15.429 --> 41:18.127
but the problems at that house
go deeper

41:18.171 --> 41:19.302
than hazing
and sex jokes.

41:19.346 --> 41:20.956
I --

41:21.000 --> 41:22.654
I want to be at 19.

41:22.697 --> 41:24.917
19's my home.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.833
You just solved a big problem
for me.

41:27.876 --> 41:30.531
Yeah, I finally worked my way
through McCallister's desk,

41:30.575 --> 41:33.316
and what I found
was a massive budget issue,

41:33.360 --> 41:34.970
bigger than I thought.

41:35.014 --> 41:38.670
I have to find $14 million or
SFD has to declare bankruptcy,

41:38.713 --> 41:40.062
so all week, I've been trying
to figure out

41:40.106 --> 41:41.760
which station to shut down,
and after the way

41:41.803 --> 41:43.936
that you just spoke about 23,
that's an easy decision.
