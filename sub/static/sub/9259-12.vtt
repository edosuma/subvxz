01:07.492 --> 01:10.052
[Chattering, /ndistinct] 

01:10.162 --> 01:12.153
Hey.

01:12.264 --> 01:14.824
- [Mackey] The Russians are on the move.
- [Man Speaking Russian]

01:17.436 --> 01:19.996
The tall blond guy's Tretiak.

01:20.105 --> 01:22.573
R.O.C. captain.

01:22.674 --> 01:27.737
He's the asshole that Carl and Scooby
slapped with that reckless driving ticket.

01:27.846 --> 01:30.406
[Ronnie]
Who's the girl?

01:30.515 --> 01:34.713
[Curtis]
Must be one of his whores.

01:34.820 --> 01:37.254
- [Groans]
- [Mackey] Oh, shit.

01:40.025 --> 01:42.516
- Oh, this guy.
- Hey.

01:42.627 --> 01:45.187
We got a job to do here, okay?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.764
Yeah, smackin'a hooker around
is not gonna give us any leverage...

01:51.870 --> 01:54.430
to twist this guy.

01:54.539 --> 01:59.943
Why don't we turn over his office,
find something real to pin on him?

02:00.045 --> 02:02.479
Yeah, I got it.

02:05.817 --> 02:08.285
Looks like invoices for
the restaurant over here.

02:08.387 --> 02:11.879
Go through 'em all. Show me
anything that doesn't look aboveboard.

02:11.990 --> 02:14.618
We gotta find something
to hold over this guy's head.

02:14.726 --> 02:19.823
[Man On Tape] Tell Phillip thatJames
and Peter are meeting us at the dance hall.

02:19.931 --> 02:23.025
[Continues In Russian]

02:23.135 --> 02:26.332
- English for Russian dummies.
- Check this out, man.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.338
Looks like a lot
of their shipments...

02:28.440 --> 02:30.931
get delivered to a warehouse
at the Alameda rail yard.

02:31.042 --> 02:34.876
According to this,
he has beef shipped there twice a month.

02:34.980 --> 02:38.006
- So it's a steak and blow job joint.
- A warehouse is for dry goods.

02:38.116 --> 02:42.109
Well, what kind of steak
doesn't need refrigeration?

02:42.220 --> 02:44.654
I usually just order the blow job.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.858
Can we talk someplace?

02:52.531 --> 02:54.431
I'm good here.

02:57.602 --> 03:01.060
The chief s made the decision
to shelf the asset forfeiture policy.

03:01.173 --> 03:04.540
I'm sorry.
It wasn't an easy decision.

03:09.080 --> 03:13.483
You were the eyes and ears
of the chief on this project.

03:13.585 --> 03:17.248
Who's really the one
with his finger on the kill switch?

03:17.355 --> 03:22.315
We have two dead cops, allegations
of corruption and a community on fire.

03:22.427 --> 03:25.089
We said from the start
it would be a trial.

03:25.197 --> 03:27.791
Cops in other divisions
are expressing concerns-

03:27.899 --> 03:31.130
They haven't seen firsthand
how this is working.

03:31.236 --> 03:33.568
Look, l-

03:33.672 --> 03:38.575
I called you out in front of Aceveda,
said some things I shouldn't have.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.577
I apologize.

03:40.679 --> 03:44.274
We know how invested
you are in this policy.

03:44.382 --> 03:46.907
That's why we want you to draft
the department's statement...

03:47.018 --> 03:49.680
explaining why
we're suspending it.

03:49.788 --> 03:53.053
Sell it to the press
however you deem appropriate.

03:56.695 --> 03:59.596
Well, Phillips is hoping
I'll just quit.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.529
He wants you to take
one for the blue.

04:01.633 --> 04:04.431
/'ve been taking one for the blue
for over 20 goddamn years.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.164
When are they gonna
take one for me?

04:07.272 --> 04:09.206
The seizures
are making a difference.

04:09.307 --> 04:13.175
You keep trying to make that case,
but the crime stats say otherwise.

04:13.278 --> 04:15.473
Those stats
are three months behind.

04:15.580 --> 04:18.310
I see a difference
in our caseloads every day.

04:18.416 --> 04:21.851
Less violent crime,
less gang activity.

04:21.952 --> 04:25.946
- Those numbers catch up,
they'll show that I'm right.
- Not if they shut you down now.

04:26.057 --> 04:29.390
Well, it's not a done deal
until Pol Com signs off on it.

04:29.494 --> 04:33.328
They're assuming your committee
will just rubber-stamp it.

04:33.431 --> 04:35.296
The next session is in three days.

04:38.303 --> 04:41.329
I know how much
you've got invested in the Barn.

04:41.439 --> 04:43.339
It's your legacy.

04:43.441 --> 04:46.035
/ also know how you'd like
the city council...

04:46.144 --> 04:48.806
to have more influence
on how the department operates.

04:48.914 --> 04:52.680
Us working together
is the last thing...

04:52.784 --> 04:56.117
that downtown will suspect.

04:56.221 --> 05:00.624
I mean, Mitchell's in jail. We ride out
this rough spot. We keep the seizures going.

05:00.725 --> 05:02.556
Crime goes down.

05:02.661 --> 05:05.562
Revenue continues.
It's a win-win.

05:05.664 --> 05:08.064
Farmington becomes a model
for other districts...

05:08.166 --> 05:13.035
and you get to hang
your mayoral hat on a big success.

05:14.973 --> 05:17.965
And where do we stand
with the murders of Scooby and Carl?

05:18.076 --> 05:20.943
Have you been able to prove
that they're not seizure-related?

05:21.046 --> 05:22.946
- Not yet.
- Well, that would be helpful.

05:23.048 --> 05:25.016
Whoever's behind them
is our main priority.

05:26.685 --> 05:28.744
[Shane] So what do you think's
in the Commie lunch box?

05:28.853 --> 05:31.219
- [Mackey] Coke and a sandwich?
- Yeah, or China white.

05:31.323 --> 05:33.223
It's too milky to be tar.

05:33.325 --> 05:35.225
[No Audible Dialogue]

05:35.327 --> 05:38.023
[Shane]
Looks like the girl's translating.

05:38.129 --> 05:41.462
Hey, the guy with the Russians is drivin'
a pickup that says "Hobalt Construction."

05:41.566 --> 05:43.363
He's alone.

05:43.468 --> 05:47.905
- Did hejust leave the drugs sitting there?
- What's that about, man?

05:48.006 --> 05:50.065
I don't know, man,
but I'm gonna get a closer look.

05:58.850 --> 06:03.014
- Oh, shit!
- What's up?

06:05.523 --> 06:08.356
- Goddamn!
- Christ!

06:08.460 --> 06:12.157
Heads up, dude.
What the hell was that? Jesus Christ.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.460
C-4!

06:18.570 --> 06:22.939
[Rock]

06:23.041 --> 06:25.566
[Men, Women Chattering]

06:25.677 --> 06:28.578
[Ends]

06:37.088 --> 06:40.990
- Hey, can you do me a favor?
- Yeah, what do you need?

06:41.092 --> 06:44.584
I need you to remain silent, 'cause
anything you say might get you shot.

06:44.696 --> 06:47.893
I got behind on my book.
Ponies mostly.

06:47.999 --> 06:51.935
I started paying Tretiak back
in supplies- lumber, cement-

06:52.037 --> 06:54.505
- Explosives.
- The Russians asked me to get C-4.

06:54.606 --> 06:58.440
I told 'em it was too risky. The government
keeps pretty close tabs on that shit.

06:58.543 --> 07:02.445
They threatened to tell my boss.
So / forged the A. T.F. papers...

07:02.547 --> 07:04.572
getting it from a plant
in Arkansas.

07:04.683 --> 07:06.810
- The shipment comes in today.
- What are they usin' it for?

07:06.918 --> 07:09.546
I don't know. They're shipping
a ton of it back to Kamchatka.

07:09.654 --> 07:12.646
Oh, shit. Every one
of those countries is so worried...

07:12.757 --> 07:16.523
about what's getting smuggled in, nobody's
watching what's getting shipped out.

07:16.628 --> 07:22.066
That clay hits Russian soil, R.O.C. can distribute
it to any major terrorist organization.

07:22.167 --> 07:25.193
What size shipment
are we talking about?

07:25.303 --> 07:27.203
A ton.

07:27.305 --> 07:31.435
Tell A.T.F. it went down too fast to call.
We'll let them haul it away.

07:31.543 --> 07:34.011
I'll get SWAT and the bomb crew
to back us up.

07:34.112 --> 07:37.206
- Great. "Us"?
- I'm riding with you and your guys on this.

07:37.315 --> 07:39.579
Hey, wait. This is real
"breach and bang'"stuff.

07:39.684 --> 07:41.709
It's not a great time
to babysit.

07:41.820 --> 07:44.983
In three days, Phillips is gonna
recommend to the police commission...

07:45.090 --> 07:46.990
that they kill
our seizure policy.

07:47.092 --> 07:50.926
We need to prove that these cop killings
aren't seizure-related.

07:51.029 --> 07:53.361
That gives us a lifeline.

07:53.465 --> 07:57.196
What we need is to find everyone who
was involved in killing Carl and Scooby.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.600
Which is why I'm coming with.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.745
[Chattering]

08:09.447 --> 08:11.347
So how you wanna do this?

08:11.449 --> 08:15.385
C-4's pretty harmless without a cap,
but I wouldn't wanna risk any gunplay.

08:15.487 --> 08:18.479
Let them lock up the container. Have the
sharpshooters take point on the bridge.

08:18.590 --> 08:21.616
My guys will be the first wave.
Have SWAT take tactical watch.

08:21.726 --> 08:25.093
- Back us up with unis.
- Okay.

08:25.196 --> 08:27.664
- You find Tretiak?
- He's back at the restaurant.

08:27.766 --> 08:29.666
Guess he didn't like heavy lifting.

08:29.768 --> 08:32.202
He's saving his strength
for the hooker beating.

08:32.303 --> 08:35.397
When we're done here, you two peel off.
Pick up Tretiak and his lieutenant.

08:35.506 --> 08:37.941
And grab the hooker too.
We're gonna need a translator.

08:38.042 --> 08:41.477
I know these Russians. Once they
get into custody, they turn into stone.

08:41.578 --> 08:43.570
I'm tired of our leads dead-ending.

08:43.681 --> 08:46.707
We're gonna bleed Tretiak for everything
he knows about Carl and Scooby.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.547
- Okay, we're all set.
- Us too.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.144
- Hands in the air right now!
- [Voices Overlapping]

08:51.256 --> 08:53.520
- Face down on the ground!
- Let's go, Boris!

08:53.625 --> 08:56.219
- You, buddy, on the ground!
- Get down, right now!

08:56.327 --> 08:58.056
- Goddamn it.
- [Sirens Blaring]

09:02.066 --> 09:04.261
Take your arms out wide!
Let's go!

09:04.369 --> 09:07.497
Cold war's over, boys!

09:07.639 --> 09:12.076
No sign of a struggle. No buckshot
through the hands. He never saw it comin'.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.146
- That better or worse?
- Either way, it's worse.

09:15.246 --> 09:17.476
Sir, a tech found this
and a 12-gauge shell.

09:17.582 --> 09:19.573
Looks like the victim's wallet.

09:19.684 --> 09:23.450
Gill Prue. Local.
Am Ex, A.T.M. card.

09:23.555 --> 09:25.455
About 40 bucks.

09:25.557 --> 09:27.354
If he wasn't robbed,
why get blasted at point-blank range?

09:27.458 --> 09:30.427
Hummer gone bad?
Gang execution?

09:30.528 --> 09:34.897
"Dr. Grohl. Rage management classes.
One-on-one counseling."

09:34.999 --> 09:37.763
Maybe he ran into someone
who flunked that class.

09:37.869 --> 09:42.738
I know a shotgun to the genitals
always brings me to my happy place.

09:42.841 --> 09:45.674
[Muffled Grunting]

09:47.111 --> 09:49.011
He's never gonna hurt you again.
You understand that?

09:49.113 --> 09:52.048
Never again.

09:52.150 --> 09:54.118
This is right?

09:57.255 --> 10:00.622
- You are police?
- Yes, yes. We'll give you protection.

10:00.725 --> 10:04.058
[Shouting, Indistinct]

10:04.162 --> 10:08.292
Relax! Relax.
Take it easy.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.299
I will help.

10:10.401 --> 10:15.998
Good. Now you ask him why
they hired the Nigerians to kill those cops.

10:16.107 --> 10:19.508
[Speaking Russian]

10:23.314 --> 10:25.248
[Russian]

10:25.350 --> 10:27.614
[Screaming, Shouting]

10:27.719 --> 10:31.280
Jesus! We're gonna need
a different plan.

10:32.657 --> 10:34.557
Our victim just got out
of Chino two weeks ago.

10:34.659 --> 10:38.686
It was his third run.
He was a high school phys ed teacher.

10:38.796 --> 10:40.855
Coached baseball.
His latest stretch...

10:40.965 --> 10:43.490
was for nearly beating
a shortstop to death.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.161
It is America's favorite pastime.

10:54.679 --> 10:57.409
Don't let 'em know it's eating you.
They'll never lay off.

10:57.515 --> 11:00.245
Two cops are dead.
You'd think harassing me...

11:00.351 --> 11:03.081
about dating Vic's wife
wouldn't be a priority.

11:03.187 --> 11:07.248
You're the distraction keeping them from
thinking about dead cops. Forget about it.

11:07.358 --> 11:09.485
[Dutch] You were tired
of the life- constant beatings...

11:09.594 --> 11:11.494
embarrassment, ridicule.

11:11.596 --> 11:15.032
He got out of Chino,
came home.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.033
Just couldn't take it anymore.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.933
[Claudette]
Sold your car last week for $8,700.

11:20.038 --> 11:24.873
Maybe you hired someone
to stop Gill from hurting you?

11:26.144 --> 11:29.511
The cash was for a fake I.D.

11:29.614 --> 11:32.378
Forged reference letters.

11:32.483 --> 11:35.714
He knew no school
was gonna hire him with his record.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.516
Is that why he was in that part of town?
Getting a fake I.D.?

11:38.623 --> 11:42.286
- Could've been.
- You didn't go with him?

11:42.393 --> 11:47.092
No. I was at
my 6:30 A.A. meeting.

11:47.198 --> 11:51.362
[Claudette] /s there anyone else
who knew he had the money-

11:51.469 --> 11:53.562
that he was getting a fake I.D.?

11:55.740 --> 11:59.005
What, dear?

11:59.110 --> 12:02.443
I've been sharin' about it
in my morning meeting.

12:02.547 --> 12:08.144
One of the newcomers,
guy in a wheelchair- Bumper-

12:08.252 --> 12:10.277
he caught me in the parking lot
after a meeting.

12:10.388 --> 12:13.619
Told me he-
he knew someone...

12:13.725 --> 12:17.058
could help get Gill the /.D. 's.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.595
- [Muffled Grunting]
- Relax.

12:21.099 --> 12:23.761
Make that look real.
These guys know how that shit works.

12:23.868 --> 12:28.999
Don't worry, Olga. We'rejust
gonna scare the borscht out of your buddy.

12:29.107 --> 12:31.007
Get him a little chatty.

12:31.109 --> 12:35.239
What's the Russian for "all wired up"?
Let's go.

12:43.788 --> 12:48.157
You tell him he's got 30 seconds
to tell us why they hired the Nigerians...

12:48.259 --> 12:50.284
and who else was involved
in killing our cops...

12:50.395 --> 12:53.023
or we blow his boss
to red heaven, and then him.

12:53.131 --> 12:56.396
[Russian]

12:56.501 --> 12:58.469
- [Russian]
- [Muffled Yelling]

12:58.569 --> 13:02.562
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Tell him to relax
or he's gonna flip that goddamn chair.

13:02.673 --> 13:04.641
[Russian]

13:04.742 --> 13:07.302
Vic?

13:09.781 --> 13:12.648
- Jesus Christ!
- [Shouting In Russian]

13:12.750 --> 13:14.718
Shut up! Shut up!

13:18.523 --> 13:21.890
- Holy shit!
- [Curtis] That was loud, brother.

13:21.993 --> 13:25.019
- What the hell are we gonna do?
- Holy shit.

13:25.129 --> 13:27.029
- Oh, my God.
- All right.

13:27.131 --> 13:29.190
Get our shit. Grab the Russians.
Let's get out of here.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.632
Go.

13:31.736 --> 13:33.897
Move.

13:34.005 --> 13:36.974
- Go, go, go.
- Come on! Let's go!

13:40.011 --> 13:42.639
[Man Speaking Russian]

13:42.747 --> 13:45.272
That's far enough!

13:45.383 --> 13:50.650
He says he doesn't know why. Tretiak just
told him to hire Nigerians to kill police.

13:50.755 --> 13:54.657
The black cop gave Tretiak a ticket.
Is that why he killed him and his partner?

13:54.759 --> 13:56.727
[Russian]

14:00.965 --> 14:03.661
He doesn't think so.
Says he was crazy, not stupid.

14:03.768 --> 14:08.205
Oh, shit! Apparently, the only person
who knew anything just blew himself up.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.399
[Russian]

14:10.508 --> 14:13.204
[Russian]

14:15.546 --> 14:20.108
He says there was a young black
with the Nigerians driving.

14:20.218 --> 14:23.210
- A third black guy? Three?
- [Man Speaking Russian]

14:27.325 --> 14:31.853
He says he saw him once before.
He brought language tapes to Tretiak.

14:31.963 --> 14:34.591
- Get her keys to the restaurant.
Go get those tapes.
- Yeah.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.530
You know someplace safe
you can go?

14:36.667 --> 14:40.364
Nina, we're gonna grab some coffee
at Ivid's. Be back in a few.

14:40.471 --> 14:43.440
- This subpoena was just delivered.
- All right.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.339
What is it?

14:49.447 --> 14:52.780
Uh, it's nothing.
Judge wants me to sign some affidavits.

14:52.884 --> 14:54.784
I always get these.

14:54.886 --> 14:56.854
You ready? Huh?

14:56.954 --> 14:58.979
- [Buzzer Sounds]
- [Door Opens]

15:04.762 --> 15:09.062
Glad you could find time to visit.

15:09.167 --> 15:12.796
- Thought you were up in Terminal Island.
- I'm in County this week.

15:12.904 --> 15:15.270
Waiting for the judge
to consider my appeal.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.206
- Appeal? On what grounds?
- [Scoffs] Innocence.

15:18.309 --> 15:20.869
I didn't rob that market.

15:20.978 --> 15:25.381
Three witnesses,
including myself, saw you.

15:25.483 --> 15:28.350
Well, Ricky,
he went in for food.

15:28.452 --> 15:30.352
Next thing I know,
I hear gunshots.

15:30.454 --> 15:33.252
Ran in to see what happened.
You pointed a finger at me.

15:33.357 --> 15:36.121
So your lawyer will actually think that
a judge will buy that bullshit story?

15:36.227 --> 15:38.127
Oh, that's not gonna happen.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.288
They're gonna drop the charges
when you take the stand...

15:40.398 --> 15:43.060
and admit that
you forced my confession.

15:46.437 --> 15:49.429
Otherwise, /'m just gonna
tell the whole courtroom...

15:49.540 --> 15:51.974
what went down with us.

15:52.076 --> 15:57.480
- [Chuckling] I ain't got nothin' to lose.
- No one's gonna believe you.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.574
Well, I got
the picture to prove it.

16:00.685 --> 16:03.176
Oh, you know...

16:03.287 --> 16:07.223
on your knees,
my dick in your mouth.

16:07.325 --> 16:09.520
Shut up.
Shut up.

16:09.627 --> 16:12.152
You forget the 50 ways
that / can screw you...

16:12.263 --> 16:15.892
and your loved ones to death
if you open your mouth?

16:16.000 --> 16:19.128
My grandma-
she died last month.

16:19.237 --> 16:21.762
Had that throat cancer.

16:21.872 --> 16:26.900
My mom, she got tired of wipin'
rich kids' ass and moved back to Mexico.

16:28.412 --> 16:30.403
You don't have a picture...

16:30.514 --> 16:32.982
and neither
does your girlfriend.

16:33.084 --> 16:37.384
Believe what you want.
Believe what you want.

16:37.488 --> 16:42.585
But you will get on that stand
and say you violated my rights.

16:42.693 --> 16:45.355
Or you will pull some strings
and get me out of here...

16:45.463 --> 16:47.693
power man!

16:50.368 --> 16:53.030
Show me what you can do.

16:54.772 --> 16:57.070
- Show it to me.
- [Buzzer Sounds]

17:01.078 --> 17:04.945
- We found Tretiak.
- Damn!

17:05.049 --> 17:07.108
Must've mishandled
his merchandise.

17:07.218 --> 17:10.118
Our best lead to these cop killers
just got blown to hell.

17:10.221 --> 17:14.021
Well, if he was involved,
it smells like justice to me.

17:14.125 --> 17:17.526
We'll go through the restaurant,
see if it gives us anything.

17:22.733 --> 17:26.099
We traced some of these
books on tape in Tretiak's office...

17:26.203 --> 17:29.195
to the U.C. Northridge
language library.

17:29.307 --> 17:32.834
Checked out by a Jason Porter.J.P.

17:32.943 --> 17:34.843
- Ring a bell?
- Yeah.

17:34.945 --> 17:39.211
Dutch found a J.P. necklace in the sewer
next to Carl and Scooby's bodies.

17:39.317 --> 17:41.581
This kid's a foreign language major.
Spanish, Korean, Russian.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.950
Clean record.
Got his dad's address.

17:44.055 --> 17:47.024
Department head says he's been M./.A.
from classes for the last two weeks.

17:47.124 --> 17:48.921
Since Carl and Scooby were killed.

17:49.026 --> 17:52.587
- [Knocking]
- We're looking forJason Porter.

17:52.697 --> 17:57.430
So am I.
I haven't seen my boy in two weeks.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.265
Come on in.
Look around if you like.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.931
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

18:03.040 --> 18:06.032
He's an adult. Uh, road trips
to Northern California all the time.

18:06.143 --> 18:09.442
Uh, college buddies.
Why are you lookin'for him?

18:09.547 --> 18:12.414
He may know a couple of Nigerians
involved in a shooting.

18:12.516 --> 18:16.043
- We need to talk to him.
- No, it doesn't sound likeJason's friends.

18:16.153 --> 18:19.316
Oh, shit.
Hey, check this out.

18:21.392 --> 18:24.691
That's Jason.

18:24.795 --> 18:27.389
This guy always show up
at your picnics?

18:27.498 --> 18:31.662
Antwon Mitchell,
Jason's half brother.

18:31.769 --> 18:34.397
You're not Antwon's
biological father?

18:34.505 --> 18:37.303
No, Jason and Antwon
share the same mother.

18:37.408 --> 18:41.469
Antwon and I
are no relation.

18:41.579 --> 18:45.709
You were a correctional officer
at Chowchilla, weren't you?

18:45.816 --> 18:49.582
- Yeah.
- Knocked up Antwon's incarcerated mother.

18:49.687 --> 18:51.587
Cost you your job.

18:51.689 --> 18:55.989
Got into security work
and raised Jason on my own.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.084
If you know where your son is,
you need to tell us.

19:00.097 --> 19:05.160
Places he goes, his friends.

19:05.269 --> 19:10.104
Guess I didn't ask enough questions about
where he goes and who he hangs out with.

19:10.207 --> 19:12.368
I'm sorry about that.

19:13.911 --> 19:17.369
/ cross-referenced Bumper
with D.U./. 's.

19:17.481 --> 19:19.540
"Francis Valverde, a.k.a. Bumper."

19:19.650 --> 19:23.586
Various gang stuff.
Took a bullet in a drive-by two years ago.

19:23.687 --> 19:26.178
Left him wheelchair-bound.
He's been clean ever since.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.724
Paula and Carlos
are scooping him up now.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.328
[Laughter]

19:36.901 --> 19:39.392
Well, if the pad fits-

19:39.503 --> 19:43.132
I packed the napkins,
forgot the sandwich.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.211
Hey, uh- Hey, hey.
You find out who's pulling this shit?

19:53.317 --> 19:55.512
- No, not yet.
- Did you ask around, or-

19:55.619 --> 19:57.883
Look, I've been workin' an assault
that's got me spinnin'.

19:57.988 --> 20:01.253
But I'm onto it.
I promise, okay?

20:01.358 --> 20:03.849
You think this kid's capable
of murdering two cops?

20:03.961 --> 20:07.658
Antwon's blood?
It wouldn't surprise me.

20:07.765 --> 20:10.928
He could be hiding anywhere.
How do we find him?

20:11.035 --> 20:13.333
/ got a C./.
who works a pawnshop.

20:13.437 --> 20:15.632
He put the word out on the street
that P.D. never found the necklace-

20:15.739 --> 20:17.832
that it's just
sitting there at his shop.

20:17.942 --> 20:19.842
That's an expensive
piece of ice.

20:19.944 --> 20:23.607
Mm-hmm. I'm hopin' that greed wins out
over smarts, and he comes to claim it.

20:23.714 --> 20:26.376
Listen, man,
/'m the B.N.O.C., brother, okay?

20:26.484 --> 20:28.452
I spread the word
from Crenshaw to Northridge.

20:28.552 --> 20:30.679
If he's in town,
he got the memo.

20:30.788 --> 20:34.349
The video recorders are all on. Just step
on this power strip, they'll all kick in.

20:34.458 --> 20:37.518
You can'tjust sell him the necklace.
You gotta make him prove that it's his.

20:37.628 --> 20:39.960
I'm well versed in
the conversational arts.

20:40.064 --> 20:42.532
Good.
Here's for your education.

20:42.633 --> 20:46.125
- There's another hundred
if you don't screw it up.
- Come on, buddy.

20:48.005 --> 20:50.940
/ call the police, / don't know exactly,
six or seven times a month.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.941
I've stopped keeping track.

20:53.043 --> 20:56.911
Harassment can be hard to prove.
It's random, unpredictable.

20:57.014 --> 21:00.415
It's as if they think it's my fault,
or it's all in my head.

21:00.518 --> 21:04.386
The phone calls, the rotten eggs
on my car, the bleach on my lawn.

21:04.488 --> 21:07.048
Tell me about
the, uh, call today.

21:07.157 --> 21:09.284
/t was from a man
who has called before who says...

21:09.393 --> 21:12.658
I deserve to suffer
the way Will's victims suffered.

21:12.763 --> 21:15.095
Said he was gonna rape you?
Kill you? He used those words?

21:15.199 --> 21:18.327
He said he watched me come home.
He knew what / was wearing.

21:18.435 --> 21:21.268
The police are not
gonna protect me.

21:21.372 --> 21:23.863
I thought you could
help me get a carry permit.

21:23.974 --> 21:26.943
For a gun?
Do you have one?

21:27.044 --> 21:28.944
What choice did / have?

21:30.648 --> 21:34.982
Listen, most of the time,
threats arejust threats.

21:35.085 --> 21:38.714
Somebody trying to feel powerful
by making you afraid.

21:38.822 --> 21:41.552
Well, it's working.

21:41.659 --> 21:46.062
Hey, guys, we haveJoanna Faulks's
phone records from the last month.

21:46.163 --> 21:49.098
- /t's a pretty short list.
- Thanks.

21:49.199 --> 21:51.099
She received, like,
15 calls?

21:51.201 --> 21:53.192
And 11 were from telemarketers.

21:53.304 --> 21:55.204
So much for the
"friends and family" plan.

21:55.306 --> 21:59.003
Aside from the 911, the numbers she dialed
mostly were pizza and Chinese places.

21:59.109 --> 22:04.445
Shit. She left me a message
a couple months ago.

22:04.548 --> 22:07.073
It's been a pretty rough time
around here for all of us.

22:07.184 --> 22:11.280
Yeah. Check the names
of the callers...

22:11.388 --> 22:13.288
against a list
of the cuddler's victims.

22:13.390 --> 22:15.017
- See if there's a connection.
- Okay.

22:15.159 --> 22:18.595
- That's him, buddy.
- [Line Ringing]

22:18.696 --> 22:20.493
Horus' Trade.

22:20.598 --> 22:23.726
- Yo, that's him.
- Come on, man. Let me check it out.

22:23.834 --> 22:26.302
Yeah. Okay.
Will do. Bye.

22:26.403 --> 22:29.861
What's goin' on, brother?
How you livin'?

22:29.974 --> 22:31.874
Heard you got your hand
on a necklace.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.876
- Initials "J.P."?
- Uh, yeah.

22:33.978 --> 22:36.708
No, you know,
l-I keep it locked up, you know?

22:39.249 --> 22:42.047
It's a real fine dog tag here, man.

22:42.152 --> 22:44.086
Ah! Check it out.

22:47.191 --> 22:49.284
- How much?
- Hmm.

22:49.393 --> 22:51.987
You know what? I'm in a charitable mood
today, so I tell you what.

22:52.096 --> 22:55.361
/'ll give it to you on the cheap.
Fifteen grand.

22:55.466 --> 22:59.129
- You smokin' crack, brother?
- Nigger, that is platinum, okay,
with half carats all around.

22:59.236 --> 23:01.568
The necklace is worth 10 G's.

23:01.672 --> 23:04.903
So what, you the-
you the bling king now?

23:05.009 --> 23:06.977
I know how much it's worth,
'cause I'm J.P.

23:07.077 --> 23:09.807
It's mine.
My brother gave it to me.

23:09.913 --> 23:13.781
Listen, a homeless dude came in here.
He told me that he found it in the gutter.

23:13.884 --> 23:17.320
That's where I lost it.

23:17.421 --> 23:21.755
- My brother's Antwon Mitchell.
You want that kind of trouble?
- Go, go, go!

23:21.859 --> 23:24.123
No, I don't.

23:24.228 --> 23:27.493
- Heads up!
- Listen, I have heard of Antwon, okay?

23:27.598 --> 23:30.066
- All I'm saying is-
- Freeze. Police.

23:30.167 --> 23:34.536
[Voices Overlapping]

23:34.638 --> 23:36.367
Shut up.
Shut up.

23:36.473 --> 23:38.498
/ have a receipt
for everything.

23:38.609 --> 23:41.407
What happened?

23:41.512 --> 23:44.037
She came home, found the back door
unlocked. Reported a break-in.

23:44.148 --> 23:46.582
You know where you leave things.
Someone was in here.

23:46.684 --> 23:50.017
Maybe it's possible that you left
the back door unlocked yourself.

23:50.120 --> 23:53.556
Why, with everything that's happening to me,
would I leave the door unlocked?

23:53.657 --> 23:56.387
- You can go, Officers. Thank you.
- Sure thing, Detective.

24:01.799 --> 24:04.427
The carry permit-
I'd still like to get that.

24:04.535 --> 24:06.833
Honestly, I don't, uh-
I don't think it's a good idea.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.368
Uh, listen, I owe you an apology.
You left a message.

24:13.477 --> 24:17.573
- I meant to call you back.
- When Will was arrested, I was angry...

24:17.681 --> 24:19.581
at him and you.

24:20.984 --> 24:23.714
And nothing made sense.

24:23.821 --> 24:26.449
I called because
I thought perhaps...

24:26.557 --> 24:28.718
I could cook you dinner.

24:28.826 --> 24:31.624
My way of apologizing.

24:31.729 --> 24:36.564
Oh. Uh, that's, uh-
that's not necessary.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.867
But, um-
But thanks.

24:41.972 --> 24:44.099
Listen, / have-
/ really have to get back.

24:44.208 --> 24:47.735
I have a murder case.
I'll keep the unis comin' by, checkin' on you.

24:47.845 --> 24:50.814
You're gonna be fine.

24:57.121 --> 25:00.352
Remember me, Mr. Mayor?
Juan's girlfriend.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.255
The one you kidnapped.

25:03.360 --> 25:07.262
Juan says you think we're bluffing-
that we don't have the picture.

25:07.364 --> 25:10.265
I'm sorry.
I don't know who you are.

25:10.367 --> 25:13.097
You can't put your hands-
[Groaning]

25:15.339 --> 25:18.001
What's this?

25:18.108 --> 25:21.441
[Aceveda On Tape]
I don't know who you are.

25:21.545 --> 25:24.742
If you really had a picture, you wouldn't
need me on this admitting one exists.

25:24.848 --> 25:28.147
You'll see it when
Juan shows it in the court.

25:28.252 --> 25:30.948
Or maybe we can
mail it to the Times.

25:31.054 --> 25:34.990
Look. I might be able
to do something...

25:35.092 --> 25:36.992
but it takes time.

25:37.094 --> 25:39.494
So you need to convince
your boyfriend to be patient.

25:39.596 --> 25:42.087
No way.
He's only in County this week...

25:42.199 --> 25:44.497
and he's not goin' back to T.I.

25:44.601 --> 25:47.092
You know whatJuan did to you.

25:47.204 --> 25:51.368
And soon, everyone'll know
unless you get him out of there.

25:59.383 --> 26:01.851
- [Sophia]Jimmy.
- Jimmy.

26:01.952 --> 26:03.920
[Aurora]
Uh-huh.

26:05.889 --> 26:08.585
Now let's make one
for Daddy, okay?

26:12.296 --> 26:14.287
[Sophia]
/t's a flower without petals.

26:14.398 --> 26:16.593
[Aurora Laughs]

26:18.168 --> 26:21.604
- Here.
- /'m gonna draw a Christmas tree.

26:21.705 --> 26:24.367
Okay.

26:24.474 --> 26:27.500
I gotta go finish
some things up.

26:41.191 --> 26:43.182
It's Antwon Mitchell's
half brother.

26:43.293 --> 26:45.193
How did you miss
the connection?

26:45.295 --> 26:47.729
[Monica] The kid's on the dean's list.
No record, no gang ties.

26:47.831 --> 26:50.857
Doesn't seem like the type
to go 187.

26:50.968 --> 26:53.493
Why are you here?

26:53.604 --> 26:56.004
Heard you got a break
on our cop killings.

26:56.106 --> 26:58.233
Jason might be
our Antwon connection.

26:58.342 --> 27:01.675
Which means the murders
are seizure-related.

27:01.778 --> 27:04.303
Uh, we don't know
what it means yet.

27:05.816 --> 27:08.751
[Door Opens]

27:08.852 --> 27:12.185
[Monica] Nice ice.
You should've seen it when we found it...

27:12.289 --> 27:14.120
covered in the blood
of two dead cops.

27:14.224 --> 27:16.158
I lost it on
my way home from school.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.751
Before or after
the dog ate your homework?

27:18.862 --> 27:21.422
- That's the truth.
- [Monica]
We know you were with the Nigerians...

27:21.531 --> 27:23.431
when they killed our guys.

27:23.533 --> 27:25.433
We also know
you have a bright future.

27:25.535 --> 27:27.435
No way you'd be stupid enough
to do something like this...

27:27.537 --> 27:29.596
without your brother Antwon
telling you to.

27:29.706 --> 27:31.674
I barely know Antwon.

27:33.844 --> 27:36.870
These are checks for your tuition
at U.C. Northridge.

27:36.980 --> 27:40.746
- That's Antwon's signature.
- So he pays some bills.
Doesn't mean it's a love fest.

27:40.851 --> 27:42.751
[Mackey]
Antwon paid for your college.

27:42.853 --> 27:47.153
You killin'two cops sounds like
the love bein'paid back in full.

27:49.259 --> 27:52.626
Antwon didn't have anything
to do with that. He's a leader.

27:52.729 --> 27:54.754
A visionary.

27:54.865 --> 27:58.130
His incarceration is a crime against
this community and all people of color.

27:58.235 --> 28:00.328
[Mackey]
Let's stick to your crimes.

28:00.437 --> 28:02.735
You're an accomplice
to the murders of two cops.

28:02.839 --> 28:05.273
We have a Nigerian in custody
who's anxious to make a deal...

28:05.375 --> 28:07.502
and your bling
at the crime scene.

28:07.611 --> 28:10.546
Covering up for Antwon
is gonna do you no good.

28:10.647 --> 28:13.775
Now, if this is about
you cozying up with him at Lompoc...

28:13.884 --> 28:15.852
ain't gonna happen.

28:24.628 --> 28:26.994
I met one of the Russians
at school.

28:28.799 --> 28:32.462
They knew who / was,
thought / might be willin'to help.

28:32.569 --> 28:35.163
/ arranged the deal
with the Nigerians.

28:35.272 --> 28:37.433
That night, I helped
communicate the plan.

28:39.242 --> 28:43.269
I did it to prove to Antwon
that I can play in his league.

28:43.380 --> 28:45.211
He didn't know anything
about it.

28:51.788 --> 28:54.882
So it sounds like
Antwon's clean on this one.

28:54.992 --> 28:56.926
You really think
the Fresh Prince in there...

28:57.027 --> 29:00.190
brokered a high-power deal
between the Russians and the Nigerians?

29:00.297 --> 29:02.731
He admitted to his part in the murders.
Antwon's already in jail.

29:02.833 --> 29:06.735
Sometimes, you have to take
"I did it" for an answer.

29:10.474 --> 29:14.843
That's bullshit.
This kid is Antwon's tool. You know it.

29:18.181 --> 29:21.116
Look, / know pinning this on Antwon
puts these murders on the seizures.

29:21.218 --> 29:23.550
That's a bad thing for us.
I understand.

29:23.653 --> 29:26.850
/ just wanna find out
the whole truth...

29:26.957 --> 29:28.925
wherever it leads.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.998
- [Groaning]
- Jesus!

29:40.103 --> 29:43.197
- [Dutch] Sorry. Sorry.
- Shithead!

29:43.306 --> 29:45.740
Get him up.
Let's get him up. You got it?

29:45.842 --> 29:48.834
[Straining]
Come on.

29:51.948 --> 29:55.247
Okay. We're okay.
We're okay now.

29:55.352 --> 29:57.252
Tell us about Nokey.

29:57.354 --> 30:01.688
Nokey? He's an I.D. guy
I used to roll with.

30:01.792 --> 30:03.885
All puns intended.

30:03.994 --> 30:07.555
Did good work.
I gave Gill his number.

30:07.664 --> 30:11.623
Anything in it for you?
Commissions? Kickbacks?

30:11.735 --> 30:16.263
- Just a chance to be of service.
- You, uh, happen to have
Nokey's number handy?

30:16.373 --> 30:18.136
Sorry.
I lost it.

30:18.241 --> 30:20.971
We'll get it from Gill's house.

30:21.078 --> 30:24.445
- We'll be back.
- I'm not goin' anywhere.

30:34.257 --> 30:37.192
A visitor this late at night?

30:37.294 --> 30:39.194
Must be important.

30:39.296 --> 30:43.630
I've got some friends in Justice
who might be interested in you.

30:43.733 --> 30:46.224
A lot of people
interested in me.

30:46.336 --> 30:49.305
These friends can offer you
witness protection.

30:49.406 --> 30:51.306
You're monitored,
but you're free.

30:51.408 --> 30:53.308
I ain't a rat.

30:53.410 --> 30:57.210
You got loyalties
to the Salvadorans?

30:59.082 --> 31:03.075
The D.E.A. can't make their case,
and they're looking for any help they can get.

31:03.186 --> 31:06.815
Well, if the feds want my love,
why the hell am I talkin' to you?

31:06.923 --> 31:09.653
They know the havoc
you left in Farmington.

31:09.759 --> 31:14.526
They won't push this through
without some local cover, and that's me.

31:14.631 --> 31:18.863
- Now, / can go tell Justice you're interested-
- If what?

31:18.969 --> 31:23.201
If you're willing to give some
serious intel on the Salvadorans.

31:23.306 --> 31:26.400
Now you gotta give 'em
the names at the top, names that matter.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.774
All the locals in charge.

31:28.879 --> 31:32.042
People in Central America
that they answer to.

31:32.149 --> 31:34.777
That's a tall order, man.

31:34.885 --> 31:37.217
Well, that's the only way
this works.

31:39.656 --> 31:43.854
And I assume there's some sort of...
broker's fee for you?

31:43.960 --> 31:48.488
Uh-uh.
Nothing for me.

31:48.598 --> 31:53.035
Huh.
CallJustice.

31:55.639 --> 31:57.664
Tell 'em I'm interested.

31:59.576 --> 32:01.476
I will.

32:10.453 --> 32:13.115
In the meantime,
there's an inmate here in County.

32:13.223 --> 32:15.123
Name's Juan Lozano.

32:16.660 --> 32:18.560
He's due to testify
this week.

32:18.662 --> 32:22.291
It could upset a case
that the D.E.A.'s working on.

32:22.399 --> 32:26.426
This could be your chance
to show that you're a team player.

32:26.536 --> 32:30.097
ConvinceJuan
to miss his court date.

32:36.746 --> 32:39.044
I'll see what I can do.

32:43.620 --> 32:45.781
I'll callJustice.

32:45.889 --> 32:48.483
You do that.

32:48.592 --> 32:51.459
- [Buzzer Sounds]
- [Door Opens]

32:51.595 --> 32:55.463
237. Got it. Thanks.
I'll get back to you.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.828
- [Laughter]
- [Claudette] Are you okay?

33:12.849 --> 33:15.283
They're- They're bringing in Nokey.
Let's talk to him.

33:15.385 --> 33:17.478
Dutch. Come on.

33:22.359 --> 33:26.819
We found Nokey.
/ don't think he likes you anymore.

33:26.930 --> 33:29.592
He confessed to making
the fake I.D.'s.

33:29.699 --> 33:33.829
He said Gill was supposed to come by and
pick 'em up, pay off the $6,500 balance.

33:33.937 --> 33:35.768
Claims he didn't murder him though.

33:35.872 --> 33:39.899
We believe him. Blowing off
a guy's nads and stealing his money-

33:40.010 --> 33:41.910
that's just bad business.

33:42.012 --> 33:45.175
You knew Gill had the cash.
You took him down a quiet alley...

33:45.282 --> 33:47.648
put two rounds
of buckshot in his privates.

33:47.751 --> 33:50.151
/n that chair, you'd have been
face-to-balls with the guy.

33:50.253 --> 33:52.551
And then rolled away
with the cash.

33:52.656 --> 33:55.420
[Sighs]
That's pretty ambitious for a cripple.

33:55.525 --> 33:57.891
You mean a person
with a disability?

33:59.229 --> 34:02.528
I'm a goddamn cripple.
I own that.

34:02.632 --> 34:07.160
You also own
a brand-new handicap ramp.

34:07.270 --> 34:09.601
The contractor just
e-mailed me the work order.

34:09.706 --> 34:14.074
$6,000.
You paid cash this afternoon.

34:14.177 --> 34:17.840
/f / test those wheels, /'m gonna find
shotgun residue and Gill's blood.

34:20.150 --> 34:23.016
I should probably
get a lawyer.

34:23.119 --> 34:26.918
I didn't threaten to rape anyone.
I have a wife and two kids.

34:27.023 --> 34:31.722
But how do you explain the calls made
from your house toJoanna Faulks's?

34:33.996 --> 34:35.987
Maybe one of my kids
dialed the wrong number.

34:36.099 --> 34:39.330
Her husband was convicted of raping
and killing several women last year.

34:39.436 --> 34:42.462
Your mother lives two doors down
from one of the victims- Dory Smythe.

34:42.572 --> 34:44.472
Police interviewed her
at the time of the crime.

34:44.574 --> 34:46.474
And my mom's still scared
shitless because of it.

34:46.576 --> 34:48.601
What does that have
to do with me?

34:48.712 --> 34:52.341
Okay, this asshole did it,
but he's just not gonna confess.

34:52.449 --> 34:55.679
He's actually trying
to pawn it off on his sons.

34:55.784 --> 34:58.413
Uh, take the recording over
toJoanna's house in the morning.

34:58.521 --> 35:01.422
See if she can, uh,
I.D. the voice.

35:03.326 --> 35:05.157
All right, sure.

35:07.030 --> 35:09.624
/ covered your ass last week.
/ ask you for a simple favor.

35:09.733 --> 35:13.032
- Not only do you not help me out, you pile on.
- You gotta unwind a little bit.

35:13.136 --> 35:15.434
All I see is you laughing
right along with everybody else.

35:15.538 --> 35:17.597
Maybe I ought to set an example,
starting with you.

35:17.707 --> 35:20.267
- You don't wanna get into this.
- It's not so funny now? Huh?

35:20.377 --> 35:22.572
What are you gonna do, turn off
the hose and hide behind your car?

35:23.947 --> 35:25.881
Check it out-
Billings and Dutch.

35:25.982 --> 35:27.472
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:29.219 --> 35:32.586
- Oh.
- Get him, Dutch-boy.

35:34.924 --> 35:36.653
- I got 20 on the geek!
- That's even money, brother.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.694
Get him around.
Get him around, baby.

35:38.795 --> 35:41.787
[Shouting Continues]

35:48.538 --> 35:50.472
[All Gasping]

35:50.573 --> 35:52.837
How many slap fests
do I have to break up today?

35:54.177 --> 35:56.077
Goddamn it!
[Yells]

35:58.915 --> 36:01.213
Come on.
Let's just finish this.

36:01.317 --> 36:04.411
Come on, asshole.
Let's go! Yeah, you, Vic!

36:04.521 --> 36:07.046
Come on! You too!
You wanna keep ridin' me?

36:07.157 --> 36:09.751
You wanna mess with my chair?
Yeah, let's finish this!

36:09.859 --> 36:13.317
Two of our own are dead.

36:36.152 --> 36:37.744
- [Door Slams Shut]
- [Monica] Rise and shine.

36:37.854 --> 36:40.152
You have to give us
another name.

36:40.256 --> 36:44.590
Apparently, Antwon's lawyer thinks
helping you is a conflict of interest.

36:44.694 --> 36:47.254
- / don't understand.
- It means your big brother doesn't give a shit...

36:47.363 --> 36:49.263
about where you end up,
which makes me wonder...

36:49.365 --> 36:51.333
why you're trying so hard
to protect him.

36:51.434 --> 36:53.334
Antwon's just
lookin' out for me.

36:53.436 --> 36:56.872
Then why'd he make such a big show
about that custom necklace he got for ya?

36:56.973 --> 36:59.407
A couple of his boys
picked it up in a robbery.

36:59.509 --> 37:02.342
The original owner has confirmed
that it was stolen.

37:02.445 --> 37:06.779
Antwon's always got my back,
ever since I was a shorty.

37:06.883 --> 37:10.751
Helps with groceries, covers the mortgage
when my dad's out of work.

37:12.555 --> 37:15.991
Y'all arejust tryin'
to screw me 'cause /'m tired...

37:16.092 --> 37:17.992
get me
to say somethin'stupid.

37:18.094 --> 37:21.325
I'm sure Antwon's briefed you about
the Farmington asset forfeiture policy.

37:21.431 --> 37:26.198
Him being a known drug dealer,
that statement means...

37:26.302 --> 37:29.738
we can get a warrant,
look into your father's finances.

37:29.839 --> 37:32.933
The statement before the one
about you sayin'somethin'stupid.

37:33.042 --> 37:35.840
The mortgage payments
made with drug proceeds?

37:35.945 --> 37:40.473
- We can take your father's house.
- Or you can tell the truth.

37:40.583 --> 37:43.518
Keep your daddy
from movin' into a shelter.

37:43.620 --> 37:46.316
Nobody touches my dad's house.

37:55.031 --> 37:57.363
I don't wanna go
someplace far away.

37:57.467 --> 37:59.401
We can connect you
to the murder of two cops.

37:59.502 --> 38:02.130
You go wherever
we say you go.

38:02.238 --> 38:04.706
Or / can talk to the D. A...

38:04.807 --> 38:07.241
get the death penalty
off the table.

38:07.343 --> 38:10.141
Make sure they put you
into protective custody.

38:10.246 --> 38:13.977
You stay alive:
Dad still enjoys retirement...

38:14.083 --> 38:16.313
rocking on the front porch.

38:20.690 --> 38:22.590
I need to see
the deal on paper.

38:22.692 --> 38:25.752
Then I'll tell you
how it went down.

38:29.699 --> 38:32.691
- This is all your stuff.
- Thanks.

38:32.802 --> 38:36.568
Could we just, uh,
for a minute-

38:36.673 --> 38:38.573
The kids are getting ready
for school...

38:38.675 --> 38:42.873
and, um, I don't want them
to see your face like that.

38:42.979 --> 38:48.542
Listen. When I said before
this started because of Vic...

38:48.651 --> 38:50.551
that's not the only reason.

38:50.653 --> 38:52.678
It's the only one that matters.

38:52.789 --> 38:54.814
See, no, it isn't...

38:54.924 --> 38:57.154
because there's something here.

38:57.260 --> 39:00.195
/ know you wanna
believe that now...

39:00.296 --> 39:03.925
but Vic got under your skin,
and I was a way to get back at him.

39:05.168 --> 39:08.763
Maybe he's still under
your skin?

39:08.871 --> 39:12.329
Maybe you even thought you-
you could get back at him a little?

39:12.442 --> 39:15.036
- Show him you've moved on?
- Men have time for pissing contests.

39:15.144 --> 39:17.339
Mothers don't.

39:18.915 --> 39:21.179
You want me to forgive you?

39:21.284 --> 39:23.718
You're forgiven.

39:23.820 --> 39:26.948
[Chuckles]
Listen, l-I didn't tell you about Vic...

39:27.056 --> 39:29.547
because I was afraid
you wouldn't go out with me.

39:29.659 --> 39:32.753
And then I was afraid to tell you
because things were going so well.

39:32.862 --> 39:35.729
- Being afraid ruined it.
- Yeah, it did.

39:35.832 --> 39:38.164
Well, I'm not afraid anymore.

39:38.267 --> 39:40.565
So at some point...

39:40.670 --> 39:44.197
Iook past my bad start,
give me another chance.

39:44.307 --> 39:47.003
Let me know.

39:48.511 --> 39:50.502
[Door Opens]

40:00.456 --> 40:02.515
Antwon saw
the coming tide.

40:02.625 --> 40:04.525
Black and whites' days
are numbered.

40:04.627 --> 40:07.187
It's all about making peace
with the red, yellow and brown.

40:07.296 --> 40:10.595
He paid for your education,
made sure someone in his organization...

40:10.700 --> 40:13.328
could speak the languages,
so he wouldn't be left behind.

40:13.436 --> 40:17.202
A goodwill ambassador,
only instead ofbrokering peace...

40:17.306 --> 40:20.673
you brokered drug deals,
gang alliances.

40:20.777 --> 40:25.237
How did Antwon get the Russians
and the Nigerians together?

40:25.348 --> 40:28.909
- The Russians had a beef with P.D.
- 'Cause we took down Kozodav?

40:30.987 --> 40:33.785
Antwon was plugged
into that.

40:33.890 --> 40:36.415
He offered Tretiak
the Nigerians as hired help.

40:36.526 --> 40:40.018
Why were officers
Haimes and Miller targeted?

40:40.129 --> 40:42.029
Tretiak's idea.

40:42.131 --> 40:44.565
The black cop
pissed him off...

40:44.667 --> 40:46.897
gave him a speeding ticket.

40:47.003 --> 40:49.198
And you?

40:49.305 --> 40:53.332
I translated, drove...

40:53.443 --> 40:56.640
made sure the Nigerians had
what they needed to get thejob done.

40:56.746 --> 40:58.714
Antwon's emissary.

40:58.815 --> 41:02.182
[Jason]
Russians have an international pipeline.

41:02.285 --> 41:04.845
Need 'em in your corner
if you wanna play outside the States.

41:07.256 --> 41:11.818
Killin' the cops was a handshake.
Antwon knew if they did this, they'd be tied.

41:11.928 --> 41:13.828
There'd be trust.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.228
An oath in blood.

41:20.703 --> 41:22.603
- [Knocking]
- Police.

41:22.705 --> 41:24.696
- Miss Faulks?
- I hear a TV.

41:24.807 --> 41:27.173
[TV, /ndistinct]

41:27.276 --> 41:31.337
Shit. She said the intruder
came through the back the last time.

41:54.403 --> 41:57.930
Miss Faulks, the police!
You in there?

41:58.040 --> 42:02.238
- [Gunshot]
- One-Tango-13. Shots fired.

42:02.345 --> 42:03.778
- Officer down.
- [Groans]

42:05.815 --> 42:07.749
Oh, God!

42:07.850 --> 42:09.943
Let me see your hands.
Put that gun down.

42:10.052 --> 42:12.850
- Put the gun down. Drop it.
- / thought you were-

42:12.955 --> 42:15.924
- Put it down! Down!
- I didn't know! I'm so sorry! l-

42:16.025 --> 42:18.016
Put your hands on your head!
Put your hands on your head!

42:18.127 --> 42:20.027
- I heard something outside.
I thought you were-
- Oh, God.

42:20.129 --> 42:22.188
Step down!
Move, now!

42:22.298 --> 42:23.560
- /'m so sorry.
- [Groaning]

42:24.801 --> 42:27.429
Give us a minute, now.

42:27.537 --> 42:30.768
The D.E.A. just requested all
departmental files on Antwon Mitchell.

42:30.873 --> 42:33.239
Shit. Are they thinking
of making a deal?

42:33.342 --> 42:35.572
Witness protection, immunity.
I hear it's done.

42:35.678 --> 42:38.010
What? We've gotta
get it off the table.

42:38.114 --> 42:40.173
- We just linked him to the two cop murders.
- How?

42:40.283 --> 42:42.183
His half brother gave him up.

42:42.285 --> 42:45.083
- Antwon's gonna walk.
You and your boy really did it.
- Me?

42:45.188 --> 42:47.520
And Aceveda.
I know all about the dance...

42:47.623 --> 42:49.682
you two are planning
for the Pol Com session.

42:49.792 --> 42:51.692
You help him navigate
this Mitchell deal?

42:51.794 --> 42:54.490
What the hell
are you talking about?

42:54.597 --> 42:59.125
Aceveda brokered the deal
between Mitchell and D.E.A.?

42:59.235 --> 43:03.296
A woman like you- I figured you'd get to know
your bedmates before you lay down with them.

43:03.406 --> 43:05.738
Oh, shit!

43:10.146 --> 43:12.046
- The deal is off!
- What?

43:12.148 --> 43:14.616
Big brother struck a better one,
which leaves you shit out of luck!

43:14.717 --> 43:16.947
- You can't do that!
- You're gonna take a lethal injection...

43:17.053 --> 43:20.147
for the killing of two cops...

43:20.256 --> 43:22.417
and I'm gonna
be there to watch!

43:28.197 --> 43:30.961
- Put him back in the cage.
- What the hell happened?

43:31.067 --> 43:34.901
Aceveda shit all over us.
Brokered Antwon to the D.E.A.

43:35.004 --> 43:37.165
- Witness protection.
- They're lettin' him go?

43:39.108 --> 43:41.201
Excuse me. The councilman's busy.
You can't go in there-

43:41.310 --> 43:43.835
Where the hell do you get off
cutting a deal for Antwon Mitchell?

43:43.946 --> 43:47.143
Hey, it's the D.E.A. 's deal.
They asked me to approach him.

43:47.250 --> 43:49.844
Antwon ordered the hit
on our cops.

43:49.952 --> 43:52.546
His half brother
just gave him up.

43:52.655 --> 43:54.418
You just set a cop killer free,
you dick!

43:54.523 --> 43:58.482
- The kid said he acted alone.
- That family has a little bit
of trouble with the truth.

43:58.594 --> 44:02.655
- He lied!
- Call the deal off.

44:02.765 --> 44:06.201
I can't. It's in
the D.E.A.'s hands now.

44:07.670 --> 44:11.401
Carl and Scooby were stabbed
over and over again...

44:11.507 --> 44:13.998
probably alive long enough
to feel most of it.

44:14.110 --> 44:17.511
I was there when the bodies were
carried out. I'm the one who found them!

44:17.613 --> 44:19.877
- I'm still a cop!
- Bullshit!

44:19.982 --> 44:23.247
Cops want only one thing-
Antwon executed for what he did.

44:23.352 --> 44:26.253
The D.E.A. cannot make a case
against the Salvadoran cartel.

44:26.355 --> 44:30.189
Mitchell is willing to give up the entire
pipeline, all right? This is huge.

44:30.293 --> 44:32.727
You mean your council buddies
get a few favors from Sacramento.

44:32.828 --> 44:35.729
Do you think I care
about a D.E.A. win?

44:35.831 --> 44:38.664
- Carl and Scooby were my men!
- You're the one who came crawling
to me asking for a lifeline!

44:38.768 --> 44:41.828
- And I was an asshole
to think you were an option!
- Watch it. You still need me.

44:41.938 --> 44:45.032
I need shit from you!

44:45.141 --> 44:48.668
You can take your backroom handshakes,
your D.E.A. cronies...

44:48.778 --> 44:52.839
and your self-serving,
cop-killer deals...

44:52.949 --> 44:55.645
and you can
shove them up your ass.

45:01.691 --> 45:05.388
You're not a cop.
You never were.

45:19.575 --> 45:21.736
[Rock]

45:21.844 --> 45:24.438
