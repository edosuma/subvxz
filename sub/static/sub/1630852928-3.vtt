WEBVTT

01:42.727 --> 01:44.354
-Hey!

02:05.917 --> 02:10.547
Leave this place in the name
of the one true God, Jesus Christ!

02:14.509 --> 02:15.802
Too slow, Pagan.

03:14.402 --> 03:18.239
-Allow me to introduce the Lady Kent.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.866
Mistress of this house.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.410
Tell them.

03:28.082 --> 03:28.958
Tell them!

03:32.837 --> 03:34.505
Your war is pointless.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.008
King Æthelred is already dead.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.928
-She's lying.
-Why would she lie, brother?

03:40.011 --> 03:42.263
To fool us. To protect him.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.108
When did he die?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.403
Ten days ago.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.741
His son Edmund is now
on the throne.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.470
Where is your husband?

04:23.721 --> 04:24.764
He fled to London.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.976
He meets with the other nobles.

04:28.559 --> 04:29.894
And left you behind.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.484
What a brave man.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.280
This is a good thing.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.657
Edmund is a boy,

04:42.740 --> 04:45.952
and the nobles will not back him
to defend London.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.161
It waits for us.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.205
I didn't come here for London.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.458
-I came for Æthelred's head.

04:56.087 --> 04:59.632
Then I promise you… the head of his son.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.418
The sword of my father.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.589
The sword of a king.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.926
Now mine and my son's son's.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.431
Thank you. You did well.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.725
Your Highness. But I barely did a thing.

05:50.808 --> 05:53.269
It was King Edmund
who brought Streona around.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.605
Your father would be proud.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.110
When Streona arrives,
I will send him to the south,

06:01.194 --> 06:03.321
behind Canute and trap him in the marshes.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.281
And what about me?

06:06.699 --> 06:09.744
You wish me to cower behind these walls
until the battle is over?

06:09.827 --> 06:11.788
You may cower if you wish,

06:11.871 --> 06:14.832
but you're far too valuable
to England to risk it in battle.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.127
Streona will weaken the Norse
and you will accept their surrender.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.045
No.

06:19.545 --> 06:22.507
When Streona arrives,
I intend to join him on the battlefield.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.759
Your Highness is still a king-in-waiting.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.178
Then all the more reason to be crowned.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.347
Taking the crown only amplifies the risk.

06:29.430 --> 06:30.431
What risk?

06:30.515 --> 06:33.434
Once crowned, your fate
and England's are forever entwined.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.396
If you fall, so does England.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.732
It is better to let Streona take the risk.

06:39.816 --> 06:40.775
And the glory.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.361
Is that not a risk as well?

06:44.320 --> 06:46.364
With success,
will the nobles not look to him

06:46.447 --> 06:48.616
as a more suitable option to be king?

06:49.367 --> 06:50.535
I will deal with that.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.258
He seems to have found his voice.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.052
He's hunting for it.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.390
Now we have raided, we are Vikings.

07:13.891 --> 07:14.892
We are lucky.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.648
Odin was with us today.

07:20.731 --> 07:24.026
Odin took our measure for Valhalla,
and he saw that we were good.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.070
-Mm.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.364
-What's this?
-For you.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.450
You deserve it more than my wife.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.202
Oh.

07:34.203 --> 07:37.373
One battle and Njal became
the richest man in all Greenland.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.890
You fought well for your first battle.

07:55.391 --> 07:56.893
Raiding becomes you.

07:56.976 --> 07:57.977
You go that way.

07:58.060 --> 08:00.771
-Now I see why my father was so good…

08:00.855 --> 08:01.981
…at killing.

08:03.357 --> 08:04.317
He had practice.

08:12.116 --> 08:14.410
I thought Christians
were supposed to be merciful.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.245
We are.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.205
You're alive.

08:17.288 --> 08:18.706
But I am Viking first.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.168
Do you have a problem with that?

08:23.252 --> 08:24.670
I see little difference.

08:26.797 --> 08:27.798
Not true.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.468
As a Viking, my goal is revenge.

08:31.677 --> 08:32.845
But as a Christian,

08:34.138 --> 08:36.432
I employ the virtues my Savior taught me,

08:37.600 --> 08:39.352
-forgiveness…

08:39.435 --> 08:41.812
…mercy and love.

08:43.314 --> 08:47.151
I forgive this Saxon
for following his king into an unholy war.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.989
-I show him mercy…

08:54.200 --> 08:55.701
…by ending his pain.

08:56.827 --> 08:57.912
And what about love?

08:59.038 --> 09:00.623
I love doing it.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.962
I didn't come here
to become more like my father.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.800
You came here to make the world
forget about him and remember you.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.679
You think that is a secret?

09:16.097 --> 09:17.807
You couldn't hide it if you tried.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.643
Need more water.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.272
Well, if this is the glory you promised,

09:25.648 --> 09:27.358
so far it looks a lot like his.

09:29.485 --> 09:32.488
You will know glory
when you reach it, Leif Eriksson.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.198
Trust me.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.702
This is just the path to get there.

10:01.976 --> 10:02.935
More.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.156
Yes, my lord.

10:22.538 --> 10:25.291
-Good, my liege.
-I am ready!

10:25.374 --> 10:27.043
Bring on the Vikings!

10:27.960 --> 10:30.171
With all due respect, Your Highness,

10:31.047 --> 10:32.048
you're not ready.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.552
Even your father suffered many failures
before he learned how to defeat them.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.512
I have nothing against learning, Godwin.

10:38.596 --> 10:42.600
But I'd rather learn from my victories
instead of defeats.

10:43.851 --> 10:44.685
More.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.654
Do you wish to fight me?

10:55.529 --> 10:56.447
Leave us!

11:06.082 --> 11:08.709
You do not wish
to be embarrassed in front of…

11:13.964 --> 11:16.300
Can you even remember
the last time you were defeated?

11:27.269 --> 11:28.104
What are you doing?

11:28.187 --> 11:31.190
Your soldiers wouldn't dare hurt you,
and I don't have that problem.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.431
Do you think
the Vikings will give you a reprieve?

12:08.352 --> 12:09.979
I am not your enemy, Your Highness.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.441
Your arrogance is.

12:16.777 --> 12:19.071
How dare you lecture me on arrogance,

12:20.281 --> 12:21.949
when you are its definition?

12:23.117 --> 12:24.452
I control mine.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.538
And if you want to be a successful heir
to your father's throne,

12:27.621 --> 12:29.290
you must learn to do the same.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.131
On the road to Mercia,

12:37.214 --> 12:39.800
you counselled me
to listen to my instincts.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.637
That advice served me well with Streona.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.517
My instincts now say
I should not wait to be crowned king.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.979
The Vikings came here
to punish your father.

12:52.062 --> 12:55.483
His head is no longer
an attainable trophy, but yours is.

12:56.567 --> 13:00.279
Delaying your coronation
is a hedge against that possibility.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.452


13:06.535 --> 13:07.578


14:08.639 --> 14:09.807
It's beautiful here.

14:11.141 --> 14:11.976
Mm.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.420
Ahhh!

15:53.202 --> 15:55.037
-No!

15:56.372 --> 15:57.247
No!

16:09.218 --> 16:10.427
Toke, hold on!

16:16.558 --> 16:17.851
Hold on, Toke!

16:20.980 --> 16:22.481
Toke, hold on!

16:25.609 --> 16:26.902
Come on!

17:04.565 --> 17:05.399
Toke.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.577
Toke's gone.

17:42.811 --> 17:43.896
It's all right.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.119
-Hyah!

18:01.789 --> 18:05.542
They overwhelmed my army
in less than an hour.

18:07.294 --> 18:08.670
Hundreds of boats.

18:10.672 --> 18:14.218
To have any chance against them,
we need Mercia.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.805
Streona may not agree
to fight London's battle.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.057
Then we must send emissaries
to the Norsemen

18:20.724 --> 18:23.227
and offer Danegeld to end this raid.

18:23.310 --> 18:26.063
This is not a raid. It is a war.

18:27.439 --> 18:30.901
A war that you brought upon yourselves
by the murders of their people.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.781
Yes, they will take your gold,

18:37.157 --> 18:40.244
but that will not stop them
from killing all of you as well.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.290
That is what Viking revenge looks like.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.887
This… is your strategy?

19:07.688 --> 19:10.190
How do you intend
to get an army across that?

19:10.274 --> 19:11.775
There are roads through.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.779
And on the other side is the bridge
and the south entrance to London.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.158
Tonight, we will send scouts
to see what's changed.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.872
And who will lead them? You?

19:26.373 --> 19:28.750
No. I was thinking of someone else.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.086
Me?

19:31.628 --> 19:34.339
We need to know the enemy's strength
around the bridge.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.301
It is an honor to lead such a mission.

19:37.384 --> 19:40.762
If it is such an honor,
why didn't your brother pick you?

19:40.846 --> 19:43.140
Maybe he thinks Greenland is a swamp?

19:45.475 --> 19:47.311
Or maybe he wants you dead.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.316
I will be going as well.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.489
I came here to repay a debt.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.117
I'll do what is ordered.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.787
Then we… will be with you.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.287
Give me a boat
and the stars any day.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.372
Me too.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.587
Who is he?

20:55.671 --> 20:57.547
Our guide. He's local.

20:58.465 --> 20:59.299
Don't worry.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.594
His mother was a Dane.
Murdered on Saint Brice's Day.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.429
Prince Harald.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.058
Why do we need torches?

21:08.141 --> 21:09.685
The tide and fog are coming in.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.561
You will need them to see the path.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.293
Oh, Freya.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.628
You have seen me through much.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.132
I know you hear me now.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.015
I don't know why I am here.

21:51.226 --> 21:53.895
Or what this strange land
means for my future.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.276
But give me courage.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.787
Guide my friends to Valhalla.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.542
And if it is your wish…

22:18.628 --> 22:19.671
guide me.

23:07.469 --> 23:08.470
Keep them low.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.286
How close are we?

23:33.912 --> 23:37.290
You'll know you're near the bridge
when you can hear the bells of London.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.471
We need to keep going.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.103
Get down. It's a trap!

23:59.980 --> 24:01.481
-Where are they?
-On the water.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.692
Get rid of your torches.
It's how they see you.

24:07.362 --> 24:09.072
-The light!
-Move!

24:09.156 --> 24:10.866
-Targets!

24:11.324 --> 24:13.326
-Stay low!

24:14.619 --> 24:16.204
-Move!
-Ulf!

24:31.094 --> 24:31.970
Fall back!

24:44.065 --> 24:46.401
-No! No!
-Liv, help me.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.989
Fall back!

24:52.991 --> 24:54.451
-We have to leave him.
-No!

24:54.534 --> 24:55.702
Fall back!

24:55.785 --> 24:56.995
Retreat!

24:58.538 --> 25:00.499
-Don't leave him!
-We have to go!

25:00.582 --> 25:02.626
-No!
-Liv, he's gone.

25:02.709 --> 25:03.919
No! No!

25:13.053 --> 25:14.471
-Leif!
-No! We have to go!

25:32.405 --> 25:33.323
Keep going.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.037
Come on, Liv!

25:52.717 --> 25:53.677
What happened?

25:56.346 --> 25:57.472
We were ambushed.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.810
More likely you ran
across a rearguard.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.437
These were not guards.
They were waiting for us.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.189
I think you're exaggerating.

26:08.483 --> 26:09.943
Am I, brother?

26:10.986 --> 26:13.613
Let's go ask the dead,
see what they think.

26:13.697 --> 26:14.698
Stop.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.827
Did you make it to the bridge?

26:19.411 --> 26:21.913
No. We learned nothing.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.749
Except perhaps
that they are smarter than us.

26:47.522 --> 26:48.440
Come on!

26:58.116 --> 27:00.160
Hyah!

27:03.955 --> 27:04.873
What is that?

27:05.874 --> 27:07.208
It's the King's banner.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.420
It's more than that.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.381
It's a dare.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.844
The Vikings are going nowhere.

27:17.927 --> 27:18.928
I beg your pardon?

27:19.554 --> 27:21.765
I want them to remain
right where they are.

27:21.848 --> 27:22.932
But why?

27:23.016 --> 27:24.601
Because that is my plan.

27:26.227 --> 27:27.937
It is time for me to speak.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.650
On my trip to Mercia,

27:31.733 --> 27:34.194
I convinced Streona not to come to London

27:34.277 --> 27:36.404
and to trap them in the marshes.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.156
And you have secured Streona's promise?

27:38.239 --> 27:39.115
I have.

27:39.199 --> 27:43.036
But as you know, inviting Mercia
into our fight comes with risks.

27:43.119 --> 27:45.997
And after we have defeated the Vikings,

27:47.332 --> 27:50.502
I will need your support
to help mitigate those risks.

28:00.762 --> 28:02.263
Long live King Edmund.

28:04.891 --> 28:06.267
Unifier of England.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.936
-Hear, hear.
-I agree.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.105
The Bretwalda!

28:10.897 --> 28:14.984
With Your Highness' permission,
I ask to bring forward your coronation.

28:17.112 --> 28:19.447
-To the Bretwalda!
-To the Bretwalda!

28:20.073 --> 28:22.158
<i>You have made a grave mistake.</i>

28:24.619 --> 28:27.789
By giving Edmund the crown,
you risk the lives of all of us.

28:29.916 --> 28:32.293
You have saddled yourself
to an impulsive child.

28:34.087 --> 28:35.130
I disagree.

28:35.755 --> 28:38.466
I have saddled myself
to the future King of England.

28:40.009 --> 28:42.137
It will be up to us to make this work.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.100
Us?

28:48.518 --> 28:50.061
You expect me to help you?

28:50.562 --> 28:52.814
I'm afraid you have
very little choice, Your Highness.

28:53.398 --> 28:57.402
You have much to gain by Edmund's success,
but even more to lose if he fails.

28:58.111 --> 29:01.239
Excuse me, I have much to do
to prepare for the coronation.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.056
No sign of him?

29:38.485 --> 29:40.487
You should get that seen to by a healer.

29:41.362 --> 29:43.156
You aren't good to anyone
if it gets worse.

29:45.074 --> 29:46.409
We are going back for him.

29:48.953 --> 29:49.954
No.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.416
If he was alive, he would be out.

29:54.918 --> 29:58.463
If he's not, you'll be risking
your lives for a dead man.

29:59.506 --> 30:00.632
He wouldn't want that.

30:01.174 --> 30:05.345
If he's dead, we have no reason
to be in this stinking country.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.312
You are free to leave whenever you want.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.316
I will pay Freydis' debt.

30:52.725 --> 30:54.435
Come on. Almost there.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.336
I need help.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.005
You're a healer?

31:24.132 --> 31:26.885
-Where are you hurt?
-Not me. My friend.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.136
I think she's dying.

31:28.803 --> 31:30.305
-Watch her.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.018
Easy.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.104
That's it.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.378
I thought I died.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.131
But you didn't.

33:29.924 --> 33:31.968
The Gods must have a plan for you.

33:37.598 --> 33:38.808
How many did we lose?

33:41.644 --> 33:42.562
Six.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.232
Including one of your friends, Ulf.

33:51.946 --> 33:55.450
Canute thinks the Saxons are daring us
to attack London from the south.

33:58.327 --> 33:59.454
And what do you think?

34:01.122 --> 34:02.081
I don't know.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.376
But I want to find out.

35:11.859 --> 35:12.860
Yrsa.

35:15.321 --> 35:16.656
There's a chance.

35:28.209 --> 35:29.210
Thank you.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.092
-Now you.
-I'm fine.

35:37.927 --> 35:39.262
I'll be the judge of that.

35:40.930 --> 35:41.973
Turn around.

36:06.122 --> 36:07.832
You are a Christian.

36:07.915 --> 36:08.833
No.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.545
A man put it there against my will.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.549
A Christian man. A long while ago.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.353
Who attacked you and your friend?

36:30.646 --> 36:32.940
A man on the road to Uppsala.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.944
A warrior with a mark on his forehead?

36:38.654 --> 36:39.488
Yes.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.326
He attacked us without warning.

36:45.328 --> 36:46.495
Who is he?

36:47.079 --> 36:48.664
He hunts pilgrims.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.711
Where is he now? Did he follow you?

36:54.503 --> 36:57.381
No. I killed him.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.263
Go to Uppsala now.

37:06.015 --> 37:07.808
And the priests will help you.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.227
I will wait for my friend.

37:09.310 --> 37:12.063
Leave your horse behind
and take the steep path.

37:12.855 --> 37:16.025
The main road is not safe,
and a horse is easily spotted.

37:16.108 --> 37:17.318
What are you afraid of?

37:17.401 --> 37:19.320
Believe me. Go.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.365
And I'll watch your friend
till you return.

37:35.503 --> 37:39.507
God crown you with a crown
of glory and righteousness.

37:43.761 --> 37:47.265
And may you obtain the crown
of an everlasting kingdom

37:49.016 --> 37:52.186
by the gift of Him
whose kingdom endureth forever.

37:54.563 --> 37:57.358
Stand firm and hold fast from henceforth.

38:13.082 --> 38:14.000
Amen.

38:14.792 --> 38:15.793
Amen.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.673
This way!

38:23.634 --> 38:26.095
Unload the food,
it must be shared.

38:27.054 --> 38:28.431
Look at all the food.

38:29.348 --> 38:31.017
They're preparing for a siege.

38:34.520 --> 38:36.188
What happened to you?

38:36.272 --> 38:37.606
What happened to you?

38:38.107 --> 38:39.483
Why are you covered in mud?

38:40.818 --> 38:42.320
What's wrong with your friend?

38:42.945 --> 38:44.071
Doesn't he speak?

38:46.866 --> 38:49.285
Not since the Vikings
burned down his village,

38:50.578 --> 38:51.829
killed his children,

38:52.496 --> 38:53.998
stole his animals,

38:54.081 --> 38:55.708
-and took his wife.
-Oh.

39:08.262 --> 39:09.805
What did she say?

39:10.639 --> 39:12.767
-She said you need a bath.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.269
This way to the bridge.

39:16.979 --> 39:17.980
Incoming!

39:22.985 --> 39:24.236
Keep moving!

39:28.991 --> 39:30.368
Move that cart!

39:35.790 --> 39:37.541
You. Hold right there.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.046
Lift!

40:19.500 --> 40:20.793
Release!

40:26.215 --> 40:28.092
Right. Straight on.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.178
No pushing!

40:53.492 --> 40:55.536


41:44.293 --> 41:45.336
Pagan.

41:50.090 --> 41:53.010
There are two trails of blood.
They lead this way.

42:12.238 --> 42:13.155
Find them.
