07:14.100 --> 07:15.468

THE WAY TO DO IT

IS TO SET UP A MEETING
WITH THE ARCHITECT,

07:18.705 --> 07:21.041
AND THEN WE MAKE A PERFECT
DREAM-HOME FLOOR PLAN FOR YOU.

07:21.074 --> 07:24.544

PENTHOUSE DOWNTOWN. ANYWHERE.

08:21.534 --> 08:23.536
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,
I'VE GOT A COUPLE IDEAS.

08:23.570 --> 08:26.573
- THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.808
- WHAT IS--WHAT IS THAT?

08:28.842 --> 08:32.212
- OH, THAT'S, UH--
THAT'S INDY.

08:32.245 --> 08:36.583
HE'S A WALLABY.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.424
- SO, YOU HAVE
A KANGAROO?

08:44.457 --> 08:47.160
OKAY...

08:47.193 --> 08:48.561
A KANGAROO.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.663
YOU DIDN'T THINK
THAT MAYBE WHEN WE TALKED

08:50.697 --> 08:52.899
ABOUT WHAT KIND OF APARTMENT
YOU WANTED, YOU, YOU KNOW--

08:52.932 --> 08:54.501
YOU'D MENTION
THAT YOU HAD A KANGAROO.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.670
POW!

08:56.703 --> 09:00.607
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S,
LIKE, READY TO POUNCE.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.676
- NAH, HE'S JUST CHILLING.

09:02.709 --> 09:03.843
- I THINK
MY HEART RATE IS, LIKE,

09:03.877 --> 09:07.113
HEAVILY ELEVATED
RIGHT NOW.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.082
HEY, INDY...

09:11.584 --> 09:14.521
INDY.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.623
OH, GOD.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.391
WELL, THIS HAS GOTTA BE
THE MOST UNIQUE PET

09:18.425 --> 09:19.626
I THINK I'VE EVER SEEN
IN THE CITY.

09:19.659 --> 09:20.560
- IT'S PRETTY OUTRAGEOUS,
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

09:20.593 --> 09:22.729
- IT'S LIKE A BIG BUNNY.
- YEAH.

09:22.762 --> 09:25.031
- THIS ISN'T A BUNNY.
THIS IS NOTHING LIKE A BUNNY.

09:25.031 --> 09:27.801
THIS IS A GIANT RAT,
AND IT'S GROSS.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.202
OOH!

09:29.235 --> 09:34.140
OKAY. OKAY. GOOD TO KNOW.
A LOT OF BUILDINGS HAVE...

09:34.174 --> 09:36.576
PET RESTRICTIONS.

09:36.609 --> 09:38.144
THIS ISN'T GONNA BE EASY.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.046
I MEAN, IN MANHATTAN,
YOU'RE NOT BUYING A HOUSE.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.549
YOU'RE BUYING AN APARTMENT
IN A CONDO OR A CO-OP,

09:42.582 --> 09:44.551
WHERE THERE'S
LOTS AND LOTS OF RULES.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.820
AND KANGAROO-FRIENDLY
ISN'T ONE OF 'EM.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.355
- DO YOU WANNA TRY THE POUCH?
- NO.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.556
- NO?
- SURE, I GUESS.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.890
- SURE? ALL RIGHT.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.826
- WILL YOU BUY AN APARTMENT
IF I TRY THE POUCH?

09:52.859 --> 09:54.694
- WILL YOU FIND ME AN APARTMENT
IF YOU TRY THE POUCH?

09:54.728 --> 09:56.062
- YES. THAT IS A DEAL.
- OKAY. COME SIT DOWN.

09:56.096 --> 09:56.930
- GUARANTEE.

09:56.963 --> 09:59.532
- I'M GONNA TRANSFER HIM.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.601
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'RE GONNA
WANT HIM AGAINST YOUR BODY.

10:01.634 --> 10:04.037
- [grunts]
OH, IT'S WEIRD! OH, IT'S WEIRD!

10:04.070 --> 10:06.439
- GRAB, UH, THIS--
- GOD, IT SMELLS FUNNY.

10:06.473 --> 10:10.543
HEY. OH, HE'S SO WARM.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.379
OKAY, SO WE'RE LOOKIN'

10:12.412 --> 10:14.047
FOR AN APARTMENT
THAT'S KANGAROO-FRIENDLY.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.282
GIVES HIM SPACE
TO HOP AROUND.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.685
KINDA--KINDA FEELS LIKE
IT'S LIKE MY BABY.

10:18.718 --> 10:20.186
- YEAH.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.623
- I JUST WANNA, LIKE--JUST,
LIKE, WEAR THIS AND RUB IT.

10:23.656 --> 10:26.426
- COMING UP...
- I NEED TO LET YOU KNOW

10:26.459 --> 10:29.729
THAT THIS IS GONNA BE,
UM, A PROJECT

10:29.763 --> 10:30.764
THAT I NEED 100%
OF YOUR ATTENTION.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.699
- HAVE YOU SOLD ONE YET?

10:32.732 --> 10:34.034
- UH, WE JUST STARTED.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.102
- THIS IS THE OPENING PARTY, SO.
- YEAH. I MEAN, YEAH.

10:36.136 --> 10:44.010
I'LL SELL SOME FOR YOU.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.578
- WHERE TO, MIKE?

10:45.612 --> 10:46.880
- 949 PARK.
- YOU GOT IT.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.516
- THE UPPER EAST SIDE
IS, TO ME,

10:49.549 --> 10:51.551
THE PREMIERE NEIGHBORHOOD
TO LIVE IN NEW YORK.

10:51.584 --> 10:52.686
IT'S ALWAYS
HELD ITS VALUE.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.187
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT TRENDY,
SO TO SPEAK.

10:54.220 --> 10:57.023
IT'S GOT THE BEST MUSEUMS,
THE BEST RESTAURANTS.

10:57.057 --> 11:01.695
IF YOU WANT CULTURE,
COME TO THE UPPER EAST SIDE.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.797
- MICHAEL?
HOW YA DOING? ZACH.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.232
- ZACH IS REALLY COOL.
ZACH'S ONE COOL DEVELOPER.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.702
I'VE HEARD ABOUT HIM, I'VE SEEN
SOME OF HIS PROJECTS DOWNTOWN.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.470
I REALLY ADMIRE
WHAT HE'S DONE.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.707
THIS IS AMAZING.

11:13.740 --> 11:17.344
ZACH TORE DOWN AN OLD TURN
OF THE CENTURY BROWNSTONE,

11:17.377 --> 11:20.980
AND REPLACED IT WITH A LUXURY
14-STORY CONDO STRUCTURE,

11:21.081 --> 11:25.752
WHICH IS VERY RARE IN THE CITY,
AND ESPECIALLY ON PARK AVENUE.

11:25.785 --> 11:27.587
IN THE PAST 50 YEARS, THERE'S
ONLY BEEN A HANDFUL OF BUILDINGS

11:27.620 --> 11:28.855
BUILT ON PARK AVENUE.

11:28.888 --> 11:30.090
- YEAH, SO THIS IS GONNA
ACTUALLY BE DIVIDED

11:30.123 --> 11:31.925
TO BE A SEPARATE
DINING ROOM,

11:31.958 --> 11:33.693
OR LEAVE IT OPEN
THE WAY WE THOUGHT.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.495
- THIS IS
THE FULL MASTER SUITE.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.098
- OH, WOW. YOU SIT IN YOUR BED,
AND LOOK RIGHT ONTO PARK AVENUE.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.707
THIS IS QUITE A TOUR.
THANK YOU.

11:47.741 --> 11:48.775
- WELCOME.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.111
- SO, UH, SIX UNITS.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.246
I WANT ONE UNIT
UNDER CONTRACT SOON,

11:53.279 --> 11:54.914
I WANNA GET THE MOMENTUM GOING.
- OKAY.

11:54.948 --> 11:58.018
- I NEED TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT THIS IS GONNA BE

11:58.118 --> 12:00.086
A PROJECT THAT I NEED
100% OF YOUR ATTENTION.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.690
I DON'T WANT, YOU KNOW,
OTHER BROKERS--

12:03.723 --> 12:05.458
JUNIOR BROKERS--
WORKING HERE.

12:05.492 --> 12:06.559
I NEED YOUR ATTENTION.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.628
- IT'S JUST ME.
- OKAY.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.397
- I CAN BE HERE
FOR YOU, YOU KNOW.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.699
I'M ACCESSIBLE 24-7.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.700
ZACH IS
AN EXCELLENT DEVELOPER,

12:13.733 --> 12:15.735
BUT I HEARD
HE CAN BE A HARD-ASS.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.203
AND HE CAN FIRE YOU
JUST LIKE THAT.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.340
- SO, UH,
LET'S GET TO A NUMBER.

12:20.373 --> 12:23.810
- I WOULD THINK,
JUST TO GET IT GOING

12:23.843 --> 12:25.545
YOU KNOW,
LOOKING AT ALL THE COMPS,

12:25.578 --> 12:28.081
YOU KNOW,
JUST TO GET MOMENTUM...

12:28.114 --> 12:30.316
UM, YOU KNOW,
SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

12:30.350 --> 12:33.753
OF $4 MILLION,
COMING IN AROUND $2,000 A FOOT.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.221
- WHICH IS WHERE
WE'RE THINKING.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.656
- SOMEWHERE--
YEAH, SOMEWHERE THERE.

12:36.690 --> 12:40.694
BUT MAYBE EVEN A DROP UNDER,
AROUND 3 MILLION, 975?

12:40.727 --> 12:43.763
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY
YOU HAVE FIVE UNITS ABOVE THAT.

12:43.797 --> 12:44.998
AND I THINK AS YOU GO UP,

12:45.098 --> 12:46.166
THERE'S MORE
AND MORE PREMIUM.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.768
- 150,000, SORT OF, PER FLOOR?
- EXACTLY.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.737
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

12:50.770 --> 12:51.771
- WE'LL GIVE THIS A SHOT,

12:51.805 --> 12:53.239
BUT I WANNA SEE
SOMETHING UNDER CONTRACT

12:53.273 --> 12:54.607
IN THE NEXT
SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.676
- I THINK I'M UP TO IT.

12:56.710 --> 12:59.312
- GREAT. THANKS.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.056
- YO.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.124
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON, MAN?

13:11.157 --> 13:12.959
SO, THE FIRST APARTMENT
I'M SHOWING ALEX

13:13.059 --> 13:15.061
IS ON THE WEST SIDE,
IT'S RIGHT ON THE HIGH LINE,

13:15.061 --> 13:17.497
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL,
BEAUTIFUL UNIT,

13:17.530 --> 13:18.665
AND I THINK HE'S
GONNA REALLY LOVE IT.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.300
HELLO?
- HELLO.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.301
- ERIC?

13:21.334 --> 13:22.669
- WELCOME
TO THE CALEDONIA.

13:22.702 --> 13:23.703
- HEY, MAN,
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

13:23.737 --> 13:25.071
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
COME ON IN.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.806
- FINDING ALEX A PLACE
IS GONNA BE EASY.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.343
I KNOW TONS OF PLACES FOR YOUNG,
FUN, RICH GUYS LIKE HIM.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.346
- TRYING TO SELL
THE OTHER BROKER ON THE "K-BOMB"

13:33.380 --> 13:34.681
IS GONNA BE THE PROBLEM.

13:34.714 --> 13:37.684
- THIS IS A THREE BEDROOM,
THREE BATH.

13:37.717 --> 13:41.654
TRIPLE-EXPOSURE LIVING ROOM,
FACING SOUTH, EAST, AND WEST,

13:41.688 --> 13:44.724
WITH AN OUTDOOR SPACE THAT'S
EVEN BIGGER THAN THE APARTMENT.

13:44.758 --> 13:46.893
- THAT OUTDOOR SPACE IS INSANE.
- THE OUTDOOR SPACE IS AWESOME.

13:46.926 --> 13:52.332
- 360-DEGREE VIEWS WITH
DOWNTOWN, HUDSON RIVER VIEWS...

13:52.365 --> 13:53.667
- GET THE WHOLE CITY.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.201
- WOW.
- STATUE OF LIBERTY.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.837
AND, OF COURSE,
YOUR COMPLETE LAWN.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.673
- WOW.
IT'D BE PERFECT FOR INDY.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.841
THIS IS AWESOME.

14:01.875 --> 14:02.842
- IF YOU'RE A FAN
OF THE HIGH LINE,

14:02.876 --> 14:04.544
YOU'LL LOVE THE MASTER.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.446
- OH, THIS IS A GREAT MASTER.
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

14:06.479 --> 14:09.816
- I THINK THE ONLY OTHER THING
IS THAT HE DOES HAVE A PET.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.519
- PETS ARE PERMITTED, WE EVEN
HAVE A PET SPOT IN THE LOBBY,

14:12.552 --> 14:13.753
SO YOU DON'T
HAVE TO MESS UP

14:13.787 --> 14:15.355
YOUR OWN APARTMENT
TO WASH YOUR DOG.

14:15.388 --> 14:19.359
- DO YOU KNOW IF THE PET SPOT
TAKES KANGAROOS?

14:23.063 --> 14:26.633
OKAY.

14:26.666 --> 14:27.867
DON'T GET DISCOURAGED.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.704
I MEAN, WE KNEW THAT,
YOU KNOW,

14:30.737 --> 14:32.072
THE KANGAROO
MIGHT STILL BE AN ISSUE,

14:32.072 --> 14:34.841
BUT I'M HAVING AN OPEN HOUSE AT
A PENTHOUSE THAT I HAVE FOR SALE

14:34.874 --> 14:36.076
DOWN ON JOHN STREET
IN THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT

14:36.076 --> 14:37.077
TOMORROW NIGHT.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.878
IT'S A TRIPLEX PENTHOUSE

14:38.912 --> 14:41.081
WITH OUTDOOR SPACE
IN A FULL-SERVICE BUILDING.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.515
- I CAN DO TOMORROW NIGHT.
DEFINITELY.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.683
- COOL. I'LL SEND YOU A TEXT
WITH ALL THE DETAILS.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.785
- SOUNDS GOOD.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.861
- UGH...

14:54.894 --> 14:57.597
949 PARK IS STILL
UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.667
THE LOBBY'S NOT DONE,
THE PLUMBING'S NOT WORKING YET.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.369
I DON'T WANNA HAVE A BIG PARTY
WITH LOTS OF BROKERS,

15:02.402 --> 15:04.704
AND NOT HAVE
ONE WORKING BATHROOM.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.039
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.174
- MAKE SURE THEY'RE
ALL FORWARD-FACING.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.810
INSTEAD, I'M THROWING
A QUASI-BROKER'S OPEN HOUSE

15:10.844 --> 15:12.812
AT OUR SALES OFFICE.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.047
- IT LOOKS FANTASTIC.
THE PICTURES ARE GREAT.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.949
- STUNNING.
THESE ARE 10-FOOT CEILINGS.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.385
EVERY ROOM HAS A BALCONY.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.186
THE GOAL IS
TO GENERATE EXCITEMENT,

15:20.220 --> 15:22.655
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT
IN THE ACTUAL APARTMENT.

15:22.689 --> 15:23.723
HEY, JESSICA.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.792
- EVERYONE KNOWS JESSICA.
HOW ARE YOU?

15:25.825 --> 15:27.060
HI. MICHAEL LORBER.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.128
HI, I'M MICHAEL LORBER.
- THAT'S MY SON MICHAEL.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.396
- HI, MICHAEL, YEAH.
- PLEASURE.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.499
THIS IS THE FOURTH
AND FIFTH-FLOOR DUPLEX.

15:32.532 --> 15:35.802
IT'S A CONDO,
SO NO PARK AVENUE B.S.,

15:35.835 --> 15:36.903
YOU KNOW, NO CO-OP BOARD.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.338
- ALMOST COMPLETE, RIGHT?

15:38.371 --> 15:39.806
- EVERY--IT'S DONE,
EXCEPT FOR THE LOBBY.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.575
- WELL, LOOKS GOOD.

15:42.609 --> 15:46.646
- HEY. HOW ARE YA?
GOOD TO SEE YA. HOW YA DOING?

15:46.680 --> 15:49.516
- FREDRIK WAS
ONE OF THE BROKERS AT MY FIRM,

15:49.549 --> 15:51.084
AND ONE OF
MY DAD'S FAVORITES,

15:51.084 --> 15:52.719
BUT HE'S A LITTLE
TOO SLICK FOR MY TASTES.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.554
- THE STAGING,
IT'S AMAZING.

15:54.587 --> 15:57.657
- I HAVE THE SAME WALLPAPER
IN MY APARTMENT, BUT IN BLUE.

15:57.691 --> 16:01.227
- THE WALLPAPER IS BAD.
BAD!

16:01.261 --> 16:04.831
SO, UM, HAVE YOU
SOLD ONE YET?

16:04.864 --> 16:07.267
- UH, WE JUST STARTED.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.268

16:08.301 --> 16:12.439
- I'LL SELL SOME FOR YOU.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.041
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE, LIKE,
BY THE DOOR, WELCOMING PEOPLE.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.543
- I SHOULD, I MEAN,
I DON'T KNOW.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.845
I SET UP ALREADY.

16:18.878 --> 16:20.280
THANKS, FREDRIK.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.881
THANKS FOR TELLING ME
HOW TO RUN MY BROKER'S OPEN.

16:21.915 --> 16:24.551
- OKAY, SO, LET ME GET SOME
SUSHI, AND, UH, SOME WINE.

16:24.584 --> 16:25.785
- GO, GO. THANK YOU.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.822
- YOU, UH.
YOU STAND BY THE DOOR.

16:31.558 --> 16:32.792
- LARGEST PANES
OF WINDOW ON PARK AVENUE.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.060
10 BY 10 FEET,
SOME OF THESE WINDOWS.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.061
- WOW.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.696
- EACH ROOM
HAS OUTDOOR SPACE.

16:36.730 --> 16:39.632
THEY'RE ALL ABOUT
EXACTLY 2,000 SQUARE FEET,

16:39.666 --> 16:40.834
EXCEPT FOR THE PENTHOUSE.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.369
THIS IS AWESOME.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.971
TONS OF BROKERS HERE,
GOT MY PITCH DOWN,

16:45.071 --> 16:46.072
AND I'VE GOT
A WAITING LIST OF BROKERS

16:46.072 --> 16:47.907
TO COME SEE
THE ACTUAL APARTMENTS.

16:47.941 --> 16:50.810
- I HAVE A BUYER THAT
I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW 949 PARK.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.812

- I'M ALWAYS HAPPY
TO WORK JOINTLY,

17:35.522 --> 17:36.856
FOR THE BEST OF THE DEVELOPER,
AND FOR THE BEST OF THE PROJECT.

17:36.890 --> 17:37.857
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.626
- OKAY.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.395
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.665
- FREDRIK WALTZES IN HERE,
TELLS ME WHERE TO STAND,

17:45.699 --> 17:48.635
SCHMOOZES THE CROWD,

17:48.668 --> 17:51.071
TRIES TO STEAL THE LISTING
RIGHT FROM UNDERNEATH ME,

17:51.071 --> 17:52.839
KISSES UP TO MY DAD
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.675
HE'S ACTING LIKE
HE'S HOSTING THIS BROKER'S OPEN.

17:55.709 --> 17:58.678
SHOULD I SEND HIM
HALF THE BILL?

18:11.291 --> 18:15.128
- I ALWAYS SHOW UP WAY EARLY
FOR MY BROKER'S OPENS.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.830
I'M NOT ONE OF THESE GUYS
THAT'S JUST GONNA

18:16.863 --> 18:18.665
THROW A TRAY OF COOKIES
IN THE OVEN,

18:18.698 --> 18:21.634
OR PUT AN AD ONLINE AND JUST
THINK PEOPLE ARE GONNA SHOW UP.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.169
I THROW PARTIES.
BIG ONES.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.270
- LET'S DO THIS THING.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.271
- READY?
- YUP.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.774
- 99 JOHN IS A LISTING
THAT I HAVE.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.142
FOR ONE OF THE CITY'S
BIGGEST DEVELOPERS

18:29.175 --> 18:31.378
TF CORNERSTONE.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.612
IT'S A TRIPLEX PENTHOUSE

18:32.645 --> 18:35.548
IN THE HEART
OF THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT.

18:35.582 --> 18:38.151
IT SEEMS STARK,
BUT REALLY,

18:38.184 --> 18:41.821
THIS PLACE HAS GALLERY WALLS,
THREE FLOORS, SPECTACULAR VIEWS.

18:41.855 --> 18:44.290
I MEAN, IT'S REALLY A PERFECT
PLACE FOR A GUY LIKE ALEX.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.226
HE'S GOT A LOT
OF ECLECTIC ART,

18:46.259 --> 18:49.529
AND IT'LL BE A PERFECT
BLANK CANVAS FOR HIM.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.231
OKAY, LET'S GET STARTED.

18:56.169 --> 19:00.040
DRINKS, CUPS...

19:00.073 --> 19:02.542
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS TECHNICALLY
A BROKER'S OPEN,

19:02.575 --> 19:04.811
I WANT PEOPLE TO SEE
THE APARTMENT FULL.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.414
I MEAN, ANY OTHER TIME,
THE PLACE IS UNSTAGED,

19:07.447 --> 19:09.749
AND IS EMPTY,
AND LOOKS TOTALLY BARE.

19:09.783 --> 19:11.418
HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.619
- OH, MAN,
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.754
- WHAT'S UP?
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON? ENJOY.

19:14.788 --> 19:16.856
THERE'S THREE FLOORS
TO THIS APARTMENT, THOUGH.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.491
YEAH, YOU GOT MY CARD.
SHOOT ME AN E-MAIL.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.693
YOU'RE A BROKER?
- YEAH.

19:19.726 --> 19:20.760
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GIVE YOU MY CARD.

19:20.794 --> 19:22.295
THE REASON I WANTED YOU
TO SEE THIS IS BECAUSE

19:22.328 --> 19:24.030
YOU LIVE ON--
LIKE I JUST SAW, RIGHT?

19:24.030 --> 19:25.498
YOU LIVE ON ONE FLOOR?
- YEAH.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.800
- IT'S A MASSIVE ONE FLOOR.
- ONE HUGE FLOOR.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.168
- YEAH, ONE HUGE FLOOR, RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

19:28.201 --> 19:30.103
- YOU HAVE NO VIEWS.
- YOU COULD SAY THAT.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.939
- RIGHT, AND YOU DON'T
HAVE THE TYPE

19:33.039 --> 19:34.474
OF FULL-SERVICE AMENITIES
THAT THIS BUILDING COMES WITH.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.177
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST FLOOR BEC--
IS LIKE THE PARTY ROOM.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.545
AND NOW THAT I SEE
WHAT YOU'RE COMING FROM,

19:38.578 --> 19:41.147
MAYBE IT'S, LIKE,
THE KANGAROO ROOM.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.650
- I'M A LITTLE WORRIED
ABOUT IT BEING A LITTLE CRAMPED.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.052
YOU KNOW, IT'S--
VERTICALLY, IT'S AWESOME.

19:46.086 --> 19:47.654
- I WAS JUST TALKING
TO THE DEVELOPER,

19:47.687 --> 19:49.889
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
HE WANTS TO DO IS HE WANTS TO

19:49.923 --> 19:51.057
POP OUT THE KITCHEN
FROM THE FIRST FLOOR,

19:51.057 --> 19:52.659
AND PUT IT
ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.661
SO IF WE TAKE OUT
THAT KITCHEN,

19:54.694 --> 19:57.230
THEN YOU'RE INCREASING
YOUR OVERALL USEABLE...

19:57.263 --> 19:59.199
KANGAROO SQUARE FOOTAGE.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.834
KANGAROO SQUARE FOOTAGE?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.570
THAT IS DEFINITELY
THE FIRST TIME USING THAT SPEC.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.538
RIGHT NOW,
WHY DON'T I GO GET YOU A DRINK,

20:05.572 --> 20:06.539
AND THEN WE'LL
TALK NUMBERS LATER?

20:06.573 --> 20:07.640
- LET'S DO IT.
- WANNA DO IT?

20:07.674 --> 20:11.011
- ABSOLUTELY.
- ALL RIGHT. GO, BABY.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.078
announcer: COMING UP...

20:12.112 --> 20:13.847
- SO I WAS ON
MY WAY HERE IN A CAB,

20:13.880 --> 20:14.881
AND I WAS LIKE, "SO, I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 99 JOHN.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.549
WHAT IS IT?"

20:16.583 --> 20:17.851
AND HE'S LIKE, "WELL, IT'S BEEN
ON THE MARKET FOR 99 YEARS."

20:17.884 --> 20:18.985
[laughs]

20:19.019 --> 20:21.254
- IT'S TAKING
EVERYTHING INSIDE OF ME

20:21.287 --> 20:25.125
NOT TO PUNCH THIS GUY
IN THE FACE RIGHT NOW.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.901
[overlapping chatter]

20:34.934 --> 20:36.202
- THIS IS EDDIE SHAPIRO,
THIS IS MY BOSS.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.604
- HOW'S IT GOIN'?
ALEX.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.706
- THE BROKER'S OPEN COULD NOT
BE GOING ANY BETTER.

20:39.739 --> 20:40.874
- GREAT EVENT, MY MAN.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.777
- PEOPLE ARE DRINKING
AND HAVING A GOOD TIME.

20:43.810 --> 20:44.878
AND I THINK ALEX
ACTUALLY SEEMS

20:44.911 --> 20:46.212
TO REALLY, REALLY
LIKE THE PLACE.

20:46.246 --> 20:49.215
AND I'M GETTING A LOT OF GREAT
FEEDBACK FROM OTHER BROKERS.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.094
- THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE,
SO MUCH STUFF GOING ON,

21:01.127 --> 21:03.129
AND THE MUSIC, AND THE DRINKS,
AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF,

21:03.163 --> 21:04.964
IS THIS REALLY
A BROKER PARTY,

21:05.065 --> 21:06.132
OR IS THIS, LIKE,
A COLLEGE PARTY?

21:06.166 --> 21:07.834
I FELT REALLY OLD,
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.904
I WOULD NOT HAVE THROWN
A BROKER PARTY LIKE THAT.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.543
- HEY, MAN.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.877
- I'M IMPRESSED.
THIS IS A BIG PARTY.

21:17.911 --> 21:19.079
- TOTALLY.

21:19.079 --> 21:21.147
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THIS IS, UH, JUSTIN.

21:21.181 --> 21:22.582
- HEY, JUSTIN.

21:22.615 --> 21:23.817
- I'VE NEVER MET YOU BEFORE.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

21:23.850 --> 21:25.151
- RYAN. WHAT'S UP?
- RYAN. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

21:25.185 --> 21:26.986
- THIS IS, UH,
RYAN'S PROJECT.

21:27.087 --> 21:28.355
- THIS IS PENTHOUSE 10.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.522
- OKAY, IT WAS A LITTLE
HARD TO UNDERSTAND

21:29.556 --> 21:30.857
WHEN WE WERE WALKING IN.

21:30.890 --> 21:31.891
- YEAH, WELL,
THERE'S THREE FLOORS.

21:31.925 --> 21:33.426
- I THINK FOR
A $3 MILLION PENTHOUSE,

21:33.460 --> 21:35.261
WITH THIS KIND OF VIEW,
AND THIS TERRACE,

21:35.295 --> 21:37.097
YOU WANT
A LITTLE MORE SPACE.

21:37.097 --> 21:39.099
- HEY, LOOK, IT'S THE ONLY
APARTMENT LIKE IT DOWNTOWN.

21:39.099 --> 21:40.233
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

21:40.266 --> 21:42.569
- THE ONLY ONE?
- IT'S A FOUR BEDROOM.

21:42.602 --> 21:43.536
SO, WHAT DO YOU GUYS
DO TOGETHER?

21:43.570 --> 21:44.571
DO YOU WORK TOGETHER, OR?
- YEAH.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.573
- DO YOU WANT TO START
WORKING WITH US?

21:46.606 --> 21:49.376
- OH, NO, NO. TOO MANY
SWINGING [bleep] FOR ME.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.510
- TOO MANY WHAT?

21:50.543 --> 21:51.878
- WHAT?
- TOO MANY WHAT FOR YOU?

21:51.911 --> 21:53.947
- TOO MANY SWINGING [bleep],
EXACTLY.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.916
THERE'S ONLY ONE BIG [bleep]
IN THIS ROOM,

21:56.950 --> 21:59.552
AND IT IS GONNA BE ME, NOT YOU,
SO GET THE [bleep] OUT.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.121
- I'M GONNA GO ON THE TERRACE.
- OKAY.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.056
GOOD LUCK OUTSIDE.
GO GET SOME AIR.

22:03.056 --> 22:04.257
I DID NOT REACH OUT
TO FREDRIK,

22:04.290 --> 22:06.059
AND I WAS NOT EXPECTING HIM
TO SHOW UP,

22:06.092 --> 22:09.062
SO THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME SORT OF ULTERIOR MOTIVE

22:09.062 --> 22:10.730
THAT IS VERY
FREDRIK EKLUND-LIKE.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.967
WHICH WOULD BE TO TRY
TO TAKE THE LISTING FROM ME.

22:14.067 --> 22:16.903
HE'S KNOWN
FOR BEING A SHARK.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.405
- SO, I WAS ON MY WAY
HERE IN A CAB,

22:18.438 --> 22:20.173
AND I WAS LIKE, "SO, I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 99 JOHN.

22:20.206 --> 22:21.708
WHAT IS IT?"

22:21.741 --> 22:23.309
AND HE'S LIKE, "WELL, IT'S BEEN
ON THE MARKET FOR 99 YEARS."

22:23.343 --> 22:25.345
[laughs]

22:25.378 --> 22:26.846
- IT'S TAKING
EVERYTHING INSIDE OF ME

22:26.880 --> 22:28.748
NOT TO PUNCH THIS GUY
IN THE FACE RIGHT NOW.

22:28.782 --> 22:30.850
- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME
TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THIS IS

22:30.884 --> 22:32.852
'CAUSE THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE,
AND I WAS WALKING UP THE STAIRS,

22:32.886 --> 22:33.920
AND I FELT LIKE I WAS

22:33.953 --> 22:34.988
IN<i>ALICE IN WONDERLAND</i>
OR SOMETHING.

22:35.088 --> 22:37.090
- REALLY?
- UH-OH.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.559
- IT'S INCREDIBLE
THAT FREDRIK

22:39.592 --> 22:41.928
WON'T STOP TALKING BAD
ABOUT THIS APARTMENT

22:41.961 --> 22:45.865
WITHIN EARSHOT OF EVERY SINGLE
BROKER AT THE PARTY.

22:45.899 --> 22:49.169
AND I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT
HE'S DOING THIS INTENTIONALLY

22:49.202 --> 22:51.104
TO SABOTAGE THE APARTMENT
AND MY BUSINESS.

22:51.137 --> 22:56.743
IF YOU'RE SOMEONE
WHO'S WILLING TO DO PORN,

22:56.776 --> 23:01.881
YOU ARE CLEARLY WILLING TO DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET AHEAD.

23:14.661 --> 23:18.064
- IF YOU EVER WANNA COME BACK,
LET US KNOW.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.966
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.068
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

23:22.102 --> 23:23.970
- AFTER THE BROKER'S OPEN
FOR 949 PARK,

23:24.070 --> 23:24.871
I GOT TONS OF PHONE CALLS.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.072
- LOVE THESE WINDOWS.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.874
YEAH, THE BIGGEST WINDOWS
ON PARK AVENUE.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.643
- THE LIGHT, AND THE HEIGHT.
IT FEELS LIKE A HOME.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.746
- TAXES ARE VERY LOW.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.647
- SOUNDS GREAT.
SOUNDS AFFORDABLE.

23:34.681 --> 23:35.882
- I'M PUMPED.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.650
COME ON IN.
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?

23:37.684 --> 23:39.819
- HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.087
- THIS IS MY CLIENT
SANDY MIDDLEBURG.

23:41.121 --> 23:42.489
- HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.824
I'VE KNOWN HER

23:44.858 --> 23:45.859
- REALLY?

23:45.892 --> 23:47.427
- YEAH. HE WAS THIS BIG,
AND I WAS THIS BIG.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.596

BUT THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
SHOW US AROUND.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.101

23:56.703 --> 23:58.571
- OKAY.

23:58.605 --> 23:59.939
- HE MADE A GREAT USE OF SPACE.
IT'S VERY HIGH-END.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.676
- YEAH,
IT'S THE MOST HIGH-END.

24:02.709 --> 24:03.943
- WELL, WE JUST WANNA KNOW
THAT THE OVEN IS BIG ENOUGH

24:04.044 --> 24:05.445
TO KEEP OUR
EXTRA POCKETBOOKS IN,

24:05.478 --> 24:07.747
'CAUSE WHO COOKS

24:07.781 --> 24:10.450
- YOU ORDER IN, YOU HAVE THE

24:10.483 --> 24:11.885

EVERYONE LOVES ALL
THE GREAT DETAIL AND FINISHES.

24:14.054 --> 24:16.122

THIS APARTMENT REALLY WORKS

24:16.156 --> 24:18.158
BECAUSE IT'S SO DIFFERENT
AND SO UNIQUE.

24:18.191 --> 24:19.959

AND SEE IF IT'S
EVEN FEASIBLE,

24:53.626 --> 24:55.729
CONSTRUCTION-WISE

25:03.403 --> 25:04.270
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT
THE COMMISSION AT THIS POINT.

25:04.304 --> 25:05.672
- [chuckles]

25:05.705 --> 25:07.540
[doorbell sounds]
- OH, [bleep], THEY'RE HERE.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.943
HEY, AGAIN. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HOW ARE YOU?

25:10.043 --> 25:10.944
- GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.

25:11.044 --> 25:14.481
- I AM STILL
ABSOLUTELY STUNNED.

25:14.514 --> 25:15.849
THEY WANT 7,200
SQUARE FEET.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.817
PLUS, THEY'RE ONLY
THREE FAMILY MEMBERS.

25:17.851 --> 25:20.653
THEY HAVE ONE KID, PLUS ME,
'CAUSE THEY'RE GONNA ADOPT ME.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.722
SO, WHAT EXACTLY
WOULD YOU WANT

25:22.756 --> 25:24.224
OUT OF A DREAM
APARTMENT LIKE THAT?

25:24.257 --> 25:27.794
- I'M THINKING WE WOULD NEED AT
LEAST FOUR, MAYBE FIVE BEDROOMS.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.797
INCLUDING, YOU KNOW,
A NICE, BIG, MASTER SUITE,

25:30.830 --> 25:32.065
WITH A HUGE
WALK-IN CLOSET.

25:32.065 --> 25:34.067
- BEST MASTER IN THE CITY.
- YOU KNOW, GREAT VIEWS.

25:34.067 --> 25:36.169
GREAT CLOSET.
SHE HAS A LOT OF CLOTHES.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.071
- HE HAS A LOT OF CLOTHES.
- [laughs]

25:38.104 --> 25:40.507
- I HAVE A LOT.
- WE NEED A HOME OFFICE.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.876
NICE, SPACIOUS LIVING ROOM,
DINING ROOM, KITCHEN...

25:42.909 --> 25:44.844
AREA THAT FLOWS WELL.

25:44.878 --> 25:46.846
WITH GOOD VIEWS.
WE NEED A BIG GYM.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.716
250, 300-SQUARE-FOOT
HOME GYM.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.718
- THE ONE THING HE ALSO
FORGOT WAS A PLAY AREA,

25:51.751 --> 25:53.553
LIKE A PLAY ROOM.
- OH, YEAH.

25:53.586 --> 25:56.356
- WHAT THEY WANT IS GONNA
COST ZACH A FORTUNE.

25:56.389 --> 25:57.757
- WE DEFINITELY WANT
AN OUTDOOR KITCHEN.

25:57.791 --> 25:59.859
- YEAH, DEFINITELY WE'RE
THINKING ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF.

25:59.893 --> 26:01.261
- AMENDING
THE OFFERING PLAN,

26:01.294 --> 26:03.196
FILING WITH
THE DEPARTMENT OF BUILDING,

26:03.229 --> 26:05.031
PUTTING IN A STAIRCASE...

26:05.031 --> 26:06.733
RE-ENGINEERING THE BUILDING,
BASICALLY.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.368
I WANT YOU TO BUY
THE APARTMENT.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.837
BUT THE REALITY OF IT ALL

26:10.870 --> 26:13.039
IS THAT I HAVE TO CONVINCE
MY CLIENT, THE SELLER,

26:13.039 --> 26:16.876
TO PAY FOR
ALL THESE CHANGES.

26:16.910 --> 26:21.381
SO I'M GONNA TAKE THESE PLANS
TO THE DEVELOPER,

26:21.414 --> 26:24.784
AND HE'S GONNA
JUMP OFF THAT TERRACE

26:24.818 --> 26:28.054
WHEN HE SEES
WHAT YOU WANNA DO WITH IT.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.389
SO I THINK TO BE ABLE
TO DO THIS,

26:29.422 --> 26:30.824
WHILE BEN
IS DRAWING IT UP,

26:30.857 --> 26:32.959
I NEED SOME SORT
OF NUMBER FROM YOU.

26:33.059 --> 26:36.463
SOME SORT OF INDICATION
OF WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO PAY.

26:36.496 --> 26:37.964
- WHAT DID YOU MENTION
THE OFFERING PRICE WAS?

26:38.064 --> 26:43.303
- UM, THE TWO APARTMENTS
COMBINED WOULD BE 19,750,000.

26:43.336 --> 26:45.305
BUT LET ME REMIND YOU,

26:45.338 --> 26:46.673
THOSE ARE
TWO DIFFERENT APARTMENTS,

26:46.706 --> 26:49.743
WITH NONE OF THE WORK.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.646
- SO, MAYBE CAN JUST--
- YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT FIRST?

26:53.680 --> 26:54.914
- YEAH, TAKE A FEW MINUTES
AND GET BACK TO YOU GUYS.

26:54.948 --> 26:57.384
- YOU MEAN, LIKE,
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW?

26:57.417 --> 26:58.885
- RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

27:06.026 --> 27:07.727

27:07.761 --> 27:09.829
- * LAWYERS KILL DEALS *

27:09.863 --> 27:11.931

27:12.032 --> 27:13.500
* BRINGS NEW LAWYERS IN *

27:13.533 --> 27:15.101

THAT'S WHAT I DO *

27:18.838 --> 27:20.106
* AND BANKS KILL DEALS *

27:20.140 --> 27:21.808
- HELLO.
- * AND BANKS KILL-- *

27:21.841 --> 27:23.376
- COULD WE GET BACK--
- LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.

27:23.410 --> 27:25.478
* AND THEN BANKS KILL DEALS *

27:25.512 --> 27:27.180
* BANKS KILL DEALS *
- RYAN.

27:27.213 --> 27:28.214
- * AND THEN RYAN COMES IN *

27:28.248 --> 27:29.883
* IS LIKE, "WHY DON'T YOU PAY *

27:29.916 --> 27:31.818

27:31.851 --> 27:33.453
* ALL [falsetto] CASH *

27:33.486 --> 27:34.387
- COULD WE PLEASE
GET SOME WORK DONE?

27:34.421 --> 27:36.056

27:36.089 --> 27:37.691
- RYAN!
[hits table]

27:37.724 --> 27:38.825
COULD WE WORK?

27:38.858 --> 27:41.528
- WITH DINA, I'M LIKE--
I'M, LIKE, IN THIRD GRADE.

27:41.561 --> 27:43.329
I WANT HER TO, LIKE,
KICK MY SHINS,

27:43.363 --> 27:44.964
AND I WANNA, LIKE,
PULL HER HAIR,

27:45.065 --> 27:46.700
AND JUST MAKE FUN OF HER,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

27:46.733 --> 27:47.734
* DONE DEAL *

27:47.767 --> 27:49.169
* BEFORE

27:49.202 --> 27:50.870
- RYAN, STOP IT!
- WHAT?

27:50.904 --> 27:53.073
- IS THIS A HAPPY FACE?

27:53.073 --> 27:56.576
- I DON'T KNOW, 'CAUSE YOU
ALWAYS KINDA LOOK LIKE THAT.

27:56.609 --> 27:59.312
- COULD WE PLEASE
GET AWAY FROM THE MUSIC,

27:59.346 --> 28:01.214
AND TOWARDS
THE REAL ESTATE WORLD?

28:01.247 --> 28:02.248
[cell phone rings]

28:02.282 --> 28:03.917
- THIS IS RYAN.

28:04.017 --> 28:05.685
- HEY, RYAN, IT'S ALEX.

28:05.719 --> 28:07.253
- HEY, ALEX.
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

28:07.287 --> 28:10.256
- I JUST WANTED TO GIVE
A CALL ABOUT 99 JOHN.

28:10.290 --> 28:12.759
- ABSOLUTELY.
DID YOU HAVE FUN AT THE PARTY?

28:12.792 --> 28:14.260
- I HAD A GREAT TIME
AT THE PARTY,

28:14.294 --> 28:16.796
AND I THINK I'M READY
TO MAKE A MOVE ON IT.

28:16.830 --> 28:17.764
- REALLY?

28:17.797 --> 28:19.699
- YEAH, UH...

28:19.733 --> 28:25.038
WELL, WHAT ABOUT PUTTING IN
AN OFFER FOR 2.3, CASH?

28:25.805 --> 28:28.041
- 2.3 IS GONNA BE LOW, MAN.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.709
WHEN SOMEONE WANTS
TO MAKE AN OFFER,

28:29.743 --> 28:31.478
IF IT'S A LOW OFFER,
THEN I'M GONNA PRESENT IT,

28:31.511 --> 28:33.646
AND WE'RE GONNA TRY TO NEGOTIATE
AND GET A DEAL DONE.

28:33.680 --> 28:35.615
BUT IF YOU'RE COMING IN
WITH A KANGAROO,

28:35.648 --> 28:36.783
THEN WE GOTTA HAVE
A STRONGER OFFER.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.685
YOU KNOW,
WHY DON'T WE DO THIS...

28:38.718 --> 28:41.121
I MEAN, I THINK A GOOD
STARTING OFFER WOULD BE

28:41.154 --> 28:46.192
LIKE 2.38.
WE CAN GO IN THERE WITH 2.38.

28:46.226 --> 28:48.061
- ANOTHER...

28:48.061 --> 28:50.463
ANOTHER 80 GRAND?

28:50.497 --> 28:53.700
- YOU MAKE 80 GRAND A DAY.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

28:53.733 --> 28:57.070
- YEAH, I GUESS THAT MEANS
I'M STAYING HOME THIS WEEKEND.

28:57.070 --> 28:58.905
- AWESOME, MAN. ALL RIGHT, DUDE.
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

28:58.938 --> 29:00.306
I'M EXCITED.

29:00.340 --> 29:03.143
IT WOULD BE IDEAL
IF I COULD MAKE 99 JOHN WORK,

29:03.176 --> 29:05.578
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
DOUBLE COMMISSION.

29:05.612 --> 29:08.848
BECAUSE I'D BE REPRESENTING
BOTH THE BUYER AND THE SELLER.

29:08.882 --> 29:10.517
SHOULD WE WRITE A SONG
ABOUT KANGAROOS?

29:10.550 --> 29:11.918
* DINA, DINA, DINA, DINA *
- OKAY, THEN.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.620
- * JUMP IN MY POUCH *

29:13.653 --> 29:15.021
* DINA, DINA--
- NO.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.756
STOP--OH, MY--
- I'M JUST KIDDING.

29:16.790 --> 29:17.924
I'M JUST KIDDING.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.025
I DON'T HAVE A POUCH.
I DON'T HAVE A POUCH!

29:19.025 --> 29:20.860
- I CAN'T WORK
WITH HIM ANYMORE!

29:20.894 --> 29:22.595
- DINA, THERE'S NO POUCH
FOR YOU TO EVEN JUMP IN,

29:22.629 --> 29:24.030
BUT IF I DID HAVE A POUCH,
I'D WANT YOU TO--

29:24.030 --> 29:27.033
* JUMP IN MY POUCH,
JUMP IN MY POUCH *

29:27.033 --> 29:30.537
* DINA, DINA,
SNAKES AND KANGAROOS *

29:30.570 --> 29:33.073
* KA-- *
OOH, AN E-MAIL.

29:41.147 --> 29:43.616
- HEY, GUYS.
WE'RE READY FOR YA.

29:43.650 --> 29:45.218
- OKAY, GUYS.

29:45.251 --> 29:46.653
- WE TALKED ABOUT IT,

29:46.686 --> 29:49.689
AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, WE WANT--
WE NEED ONE APARTMENT.

29:49.723 --> 29:52.859
IF THE WORK'S A PROBLEM,
IT'S A PROBLEM,

29:52.892 --> 29:53.793
THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM.

29:53.827 --> 29:55.161
THAT'S ON
THE DEVELOPER'S SIDE.

29:55.195 --> 29:56.730
- WE UNDERSTAND.
I'M JUST--

29:56.763 --> 29:59.866
MY REALITY, AND, YOU KNOW,
MY CLIENT'S REALITY,

29:59.899 --> 30:01.801
IS THAT IT'S GONNA
COST HIM A LOT OF MONEY

30:01.835 --> 30:02.902
TO COMBINE THEM.

30:02.936 --> 30:04.871
- NO, I MEAN, LOOK,
WE LOVE THE APARTMENT--

30:04.904 --> 30:06.706
- WHAT IS THE NUMBER?
WHAT IS THE NUMBER?

30:06.740 --> 30:07.807
- 19.75 IS TOO HIGH.

30:07.841 --> 30:10.543
YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK
AT THE COMPS IN THE AREA,

30:10.577 --> 30:11.978
YOU LOOK AT WHERE

30:12.012 --> 30:13.880
THE PENTHOUSES AT THE ADALAND
BUILDING HAVE TRADED--

30:13.913 --> 30:15.982
YOU KNOW, 15 MILLION
FOR THAT PENTHOUSE

30:16.016 --> 30:17.851
IS FOR 4,200 SQUARE FEET.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.919
YOU WANT ALMOST 4,000
A SQUARE FOOT FOR THAT.

30:19.953 --> 30:22.822
SO, LOOK, THE BOTTOM LINE
IS WE CAN PAY

30:22.856 --> 30:25.592
16 MILLION
FOR THE APARTMENT.

30:25.625 --> 30:30.897
FOR THE COMBINATION,
EVERYTHING, ALL INCLUDED.

30:30.930 --> 30:34.734
- CAN I GET MORE MONEY
BY SELLING THEM INDIVIDUALLY?

30:34.768 --> 30:36.903
WAITING A LITTLE BIT,
MAYBE FINISHING IT?

30:36.936 --> 30:38.038
CAN I GET
MORE THAN 16 MILLION?

30:38.071 --> 30:39.039
I CERTAINLY THINK SO.

30:39.072 --> 30:40.907
I MEAN,
19.75 IS THE OFFERED VALUE.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.442
- IT'S A BIG NUMBER.

30:42.475 --> 30:45.078
AND HE ALSO GETS TO TAKE ALL HIS
RISK OFF THE TABLE EARLY.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.579
I MEAN, THIS IS--
- THIS IS TRUE.

30:46.613 --> 30:48.048
- THIS IS 30%
OF THE BUILDING, RIGHT HERE.

30:48.081 --> 30:49.582
- HARSH HAS
DONE HIS HOMEWORK.

30:49.616 --> 30:51.584
HE KNOWS EVERY SINGLE COMP
THERE IS IN TRIBECA.

30:51.618 --> 30:53.920
ON TOP OF THAT, HE'S COMING
WITH A REALLY LOW OFFER.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.855
16 MILLION.

30:55.889 --> 30:57.023
IT'S A DIFFICULT
SITUATION,

30:57.057 --> 30:58.191
BECAUSE HARSH
DOESN'T HAVE A BROKER.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.893
I NEED TO WALK
ON EGGSHELLS

30:59.926 --> 31:02.062
TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY
AND MAKE THE DEAL.

31:02.062 --> 31:04.731
LET ME SEE.
LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

31:04.764 --> 31:06.433
I AM, UM--

31:06.466 --> 31:08.568
THAT I CAN TELL YOU.
I'M GONNA REALLY WORK FOR YOU.

31:08.601 --> 31:12.339
IT'S NOT MY DECISION,
IT'S HIS.

31:14.074 --> 31:14.908
- COMING UP...

31:14.941 --> 31:16.676
- HE HAS, UM...

31:16.710 --> 31:18.178
HE HAS A PET.

31:18.211 --> 31:19.379
- WHAT KIND OF PET?

31:19.412 --> 31:21.348
- A KANGAROO.

HAVE ANYTHING FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

- OKAY...

TO MOVE CLOSER TO TRIBECA.

- MY CLIENT NEEDS
SOMETHING BIGGER.

- NOBODY IS BITING, HERE.

33:00.747 --> 33:02.916
I GOTTA FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO GET THIS APARTMENT SOLD.

- WELL, HONEY, SAY HI

- AFTER MY
PRIVATE SHOWINGS WITH ALEX,

I HAD TO CHANGE
STRATEGIES.

33:29.142 --> 33:31.945
WITH 99 JOHN,
I DIDN'T WANNA

33:31.978 --> 33:33.313
MENTION THE KANGAROO
TO THE BUILDING'S OWNER TOM

33:33.346 --> 33:34.881
UNTIL THERE WAS AN OFFER
READY AND WAITING.

33:34.914 --> 33:38.685
I MEAN, HOPEFULLY IT'S HARD
FOR HIM TO SAY NO TO A CRAZY PET

33:38.718 --> 33:41.121
WHEN THERE'S ALMOST
$2 1/2 MILLION ON THE TABLE.

33:41.154 --> 33:43.957
THIS OFFER IS FROM
A GUY NAMED ALEX,

33:43.990 --> 33:46.960
WHO I'VE, YOU KNOW,
BEEN WORKING WITH PERSONALLY.

33:46.993 --> 33:48.795
HE LIVES IN TRIBECA,

33:48.828 --> 33:51.097
HE'S LOOKING TO KIND OF
MOVE INTO A BIGGER SPACE.

33:51.097 --> 33:53.466
HIS OFFER IS 2,380,000.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.835
- THAT IS WONDERFUL.

33:55.869 --> 33:57.871
BUT HE HAS, UM...

33:57.904 --> 33:59.839
HE HAS A PET.

33:59.873 --> 34:02.042
AND I DON'T KNOW
OUR, UH...

34:02.075 --> 34:04.310
- WHAT KIND OF PET?

34:04.344 --> 34:05.578
- HE HAS A, UM...

34:05.612 --> 34:07.047
HE HAS A KANGAROO.

34:07.047 --> 34:09.382
- A KANGAROO?
- YEAH.

34:09.416 --> 34:11.184
- [laughs]
REALLY? A KANGAROO?

34:11.217 --> 34:12.652
- YEAH.

34:12.686 --> 34:14.421
I MEAN, IT'S MORE WALLABY
THAN ANYTHING,

34:14.454 --> 34:16.456
BUT THIS--
I MEAN, IT IS A...

34:16.489 --> 34:17.524
IT'S A REAL KANGAROO.

34:17.557 --> 34:19.793
- OH, WOW.
- OH...

34:19.826 --> 34:21.261
- I MEAN, HE'S A YOUNG TRADER,
HE HAS THE MONEY.

34:21.294 --> 34:22.962
YOU CAN SEE
THE OFFER IS CASH.

34:23.063 --> 34:24.130
HE'S VERY SERIOUS, I MEAN,
HE'S MADE A LEGITIMATE OFFER.

34:24.164 --> 34:26.099
- BUT A K--BUT THE KANGAROO
IS SERIOUS AS WELL.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.767
- THE KANGAROO--YEAH.
- NOT JOKING.

34:27.801 --> 34:29.069
- NO, NOT JOKING.
YEAH, NO, IT'S REAL.

34:29.069 --> 34:32.872
SO THIS, HE CAN BASICALLY PUT
THE KANGAROO ON THE FIRST FLOOR,

34:32.906 --> 34:34.808
THEN HE CAN, YOU KNOW,
PUT UP A KANGAROO GATE.

34:34.841 --> 34:38.078
- A KANGAROO GATE.

34:43.583 --> 34:46.953
YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE BEST
APARTMENT WE HAVE AT 99 JOHN.

34:46.986 --> 34:51.157
DO WE HAVE TO DO, UH,
THESE KIND OF WEIRD DEALS?

34:55.195 --> 34:57.297
I WOULD SAY NO, WE DON'T.

34:57.330 --> 34:59.099
IT'LL CAUSE
TOO MANY PROBLEMS.

34:59.099 --> 35:00.633
- THIS IS LIKE PEOPLE
WITH ALLIGATORS.

35:00.667 --> 35:02.035
- YEAH, IT'S CRAZY.

35:02.035 --> 35:04.337
- WE DON'T LIKE
DOGS OVER 30 POUNDS.

35:04.371 --> 35:05.538
- BUT IT'S A CASH DEAL.

35:05.572 --> 35:08.341
- AS DESPERATE AS I AM
TO SELL THE APARTMENT,

35:08.375 --> 35:12.846
IT'LL PROBABLY CAUSE US
TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

35:12.879 --> 35:16.049
- LOOK, I CAN'T SAY I BLAME TOM
FOR SAYING NO TO THE KANGAROO,

35:16.049 --> 35:18.051
BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY
FRUSTRATING

35:18.051 --> 35:20.086
WHEN YOU'RE THIS CLOSE
TO A DOUBLE-COMMISSION DEAL.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.856
BELIEVE ME,
I AM NOT GONNA LET A KANGAROO

35:22.889 --> 35:25.058
GET BETWEEN ME
AND $180,000.

35:25.058 --> 35:26.292
THANKS, TOM.
- THANK YOU, RYAN.

35:26.326 --> 35:29.062
- THANKS FOR MEETING ME.

35:37.704 --> 35:39.105
[cell phone rings]

35:39.139 --> 35:40.073
- HELLO?

35:40.073 --> 35:41.941
- MICHAEL. HI, IT'S ZACH.

35:41.975 --> 35:43.843
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

35:43.877 --> 35:46.079
- GOOD.

35:46.079 --> 35:48.848
SO, LISTEN, IT'S BEEN
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME.

35:48.882 --> 35:52.819
WHAT'S THE--
WHAT'S THE LATEST ON 949?

35:52.852 --> 35:54.087
- UH, 949 PARK...

35:54.087 --> 35:57.157
OY, MY MOST IMPORTANT
CLIENT'S ALL OVER ME.

35:57.190 --> 36:00.493
UH, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TRYING
TO BUILD UP ENERGY,

36:00.527 --> 36:01.795
BUT NOTHING'S REALLY COME

36:01.828 --> 36:04.330
TO MATERIALIZE
OUT OF THEM YET, UNFORTUNATELY.

36:04.364 --> 36:05.565
- OKAY.

36:05.598 --> 36:06.900
- IT'S REALLY HARD
TELLING A CLIENT

36:06.933 --> 36:09.903
THAT THEIR PROPERTY
ISN'T SELLING.

36:09.936 --> 36:11.504
SELLERS DON'T WANNA
HEAR EXCUSES.

36:11.538 --> 36:13.039
THEY DON'T WANNA HEAR,
OH, YOU'RE WORKING HARD.

36:13.039 --> 36:14.774
THEY WANNA HEAR,
"IT'S SOLD."

36:14.808 --> 36:16.943
- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT THESE GET SOLD SOON.

36:17.043 --> 36:18.578
- ABSOLUTELY.

36:18.611 --> 36:20.447
- LISTEN, UH,
YOU AROUND TOMORROW?

36:20.480 --> 36:22.248
THERE'S A FEW THINGS
I WANNA DISCUSS,

36:22.282 --> 36:24.918
AND I THINK THEY'LL
BE POSITIVE FOR THE PROJECT.

36:24.951 --> 36:26.853
- OKAY, GREAT.

36:26.886 --> 36:30.490
I'LL SEE YOU AT YOUR OFFICE
TOMORROW AT 10:30.

36:30.523 --> 36:32.058
- OKAY.

36:42.802 --> 36:44.637
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

36:44.671 --> 36:46.639
- HOW'S EVERYTHING?

36:46.673 --> 36:48.942
- WELL, I HAVE
SOME NEWS FOR YOU.

36:48.975 --> 36:50.977
- AS LONG AS
IT'S GOOD NEWS.

36:51.077 --> 36:53.980
- I HAD A BUYER LOOK
AT THE PENTHOUSE WITH HIS WIFE.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.149
- ALL RIGHT.

36:56.182 --> 36:57.717
- AND HE SAID RIGHT AWAY,
IT'S TOO SMALL.

36:57.751 --> 36:58.985
- [chuckles]
- RIGHT.

36:59.085 --> 37:02.155
WE MET AT
THE ARCHITECT'S OFFICE,

37:02.188 --> 37:07.027
AND WE DESIGNED THE PENTHOUSE
COMBINED WITH THE SEVENTH FLOOR.

37:07.060 --> 37:09.062
THIS IS WHAT HE WANTS.
- OKAY.

37:09.095 --> 37:12.632
- AND THE REASON
WHY I DID ALL THE WORK PRIOR

37:12.665 --> 37:15.568
IS I HAVE
AN OFFER FOR YOU.

37:15.602 --> 37:18.138
- OKAY.

37:18.171 --> 37:20.140
- ALL CASH...

37:20.173 --> 37:24.711
$16 MILLION.

37:27.714 --> 37:30.917
BUT HE WANTS YOU
TO FINISH ALL OF THIS,

37:30.950 --> 37:34.120
EXACTLY BUILT OUT
TO THE INCH.

37:34.154 --> 37:35.955
- THIS IS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS WORTH OF WORK.

37:36.056 --> 37:37.424
I MEAN...

37:37.457 --> 37:38.458
- I'VE ALREADY CHECKED.

37:38.491 --> 37:40.060
IT'S ABOUT $1/2 MILLION.

37:40.060 --> 37:42.629
IT'S 1/3 OF THE BUILDING.
HERE, LOOK.

37:42.662 --> 37:44.497
IT'S THIS ENTIRE PART,
HERE.

37:44.531 --> 37:45.598
WE'RE, LIKE, WHAT?

37:45.632 --> 37:47.500
WE'RE ALMOST 1/2 SOLD.
LIKE THAT.

37:47.534 --> 37:50.770
FIRST WEEK ON THE MARKET.

37:50.804 --> 37:53.673
- I MEAN, IT'S A STRONG NUMBER
EARLY IN THE GAME.

37:53.707 --> 37:56.176
IT'S KINDA HARD NOT TO--
- YEAH, I MEAN, I'M JUST--

37:56.209 --> 37:57.444
- I WANNA SEE
WHAT ELSE WE CAN GET OUT OF 'EM.

37:57.477 --> 37:59.079
WHERE SHOULD WE COUNTER?

37:59.079 --> 38:00.280
- WELL, YOU TELL ME.

38:00.313 --> 38:03.016
- LISTEN, IF WE HELD ONTO THIS,
AND ACTUALLY GET

38:03.016 --> 38:05.018
A FULL 19 FOR BOTH FLOORS,

38:05.051 --> 38:06.653
IT'S GONNA TAKE
SIX MONTHS.

38:06.686 --> 38:08.455
HE'S A DIRECT BUYER.

38:08.488 --> 38:11.624
BUT I WOULDN'T TAKE
LESS THAN 17 FOR THE PROPERTY.

38:11.658 --> 38:13.393
- OKAY.

38:13.426 --> 38:15.095
YOU WANT HIM TO COME UP
$1 MILLION.

38:15.128 --> 38:18.064
LET ME CALL HIM, AND LET ME
SPEAK TO HIM RIGHT NOW.

38:18.098 --> 38:19.599
[phone line rings]

38:19.632 --> 38:20.934
YOU BE QUIET.
I DON'T WANT HIM--

38:21.034 --> 38:22.068
- I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE?

38:22.102 --> 38:23.169
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE NOT HERE.

38:23.203 --> 38:25.138
I WOULDN'T NORMALLY
BE DOING THIS,

38:25.171 --> 38:26.773
BUT I'M MAKING
THE PHONE CALL TO HARSH

38:26.806 --> 38:28.041
IN FRONT OF ZACH.

38:28.041 --> 38:30.110
HARSH IS
A VERY EDUCATED BUYER,

38:30.143 --> 38:32.412
AND I WANT ZACH TO HEAR
HARSH'S RATIONALE.

38:32.445 --> 38:35.448
- HELLO?

38:35.482 --> 38:38.051
- HEY, HARSH, FREDRIK HERE.
HELLO, MAN.

38:38.051 --> 38:39.786
- HEY, FREDRIK,
HOW ARE YA?

38:39.819 --> 38:41.354
- I'M GOOD.

38:41.388 --> 38:45.091
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,
YOUR OFFER HAS BEEN REJECTED.

38:45.125 --> 38:48.862
THE 16 MILLION
IS JUST SIMPLY TOO LOW.

38:48.895 --> 38:51.931
AND TO BE ABLE TO GET
YOUR DREAM APARTMENT,

38:51.965 --> 38:54.100
DESIGNED EXACTLY
TO YOUR NEEDS,

38:54.134 --> 38:58.338
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY
17 MILLION, NOT A DOLLAR BELOW.

38:58.371 --> 39:00.273
- LISTEN, FREDRIK.

39:00.306 --> 39:03.143
I'M NOT LOOKING TO GET
INTO A BACK AND FORTH

39:03.176 --> 39:05.011
WITH THE DEVELOPER
ABOUT THIS.

39:05.011 --> 39:08.048
16 WAS
A WELL THOUGHT-OUT NUMBER.

39:08.081 --> 39:10.850
17--IF THAT'S AS GOOD
AS THEY'RE GONNA DO,

39:10.884 --> 39:14.754
THEN I DON'T THINK WE'RE REALLY
GONNA HAVE A DEAL DONE HERE.

39:14.788 --> 39:16.022
- LET ME REMIND YOU,
IT'S FIVE FLOORS.

39:16.022 --> 39:17.323
PLUS THE OUTDOOR SPACE.

39:17.357 --> 39:20.427
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
11,500 SQUARE FEET.

39:20.460 --> 39:22.729
I MEAN,
ON A PER-SQUARE-FOOT BASIS,

39:22.762 --> 39:25.031
YOU'RE GETTING
AN AMAZING DEAL.

39:25.031 --> 39:26.900
- THEY NEED
TO COME DOWN, AND...

39:26.933 --> 39:31.938
THEY NEED TO COME DOWN
A LOT, STILL.

39:32.038 --> 39:33.406
- WHAT'S THE HIGHEST
NUMBER YOU COULD PAY?

39:33.440 --> 39:35.141
I MEAN, 16 IS JUST
NOT GONNA FLY.

39:35.175 --> 39:37.811
I MEAN, CAN I GO BACK, THOUGH,
WITH SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE?

39:37.844 --> 39:38.945
YOU GOTTA
HELP ME OUT, HERE.

39:39.045 --> 39:41.348
HELP YOURSELF OUT.

39:41.381 --> 39:45.785
- LOOK, YOU CAN GO
BACK TO HIM WITH 16 1/4.

39:45.819 --> 39:48.054
- I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
THANK YOU.

39:48.054 --> 39:48.922
- COMING UP...

39:48.955 --> 39:50.156
- SO AT THIS POINT
IN TIME,

39:50.190 --> 39:53.059
DO YOU WANT THE KANGAROO,
OR DO YOU WANT THE APARTMENT?

40:01.368 --> 40:03.069
- I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
THANK YOU.

40:03.103 --> 40:06.306
- BYE.

40:06.339 --> 40:09.409
- LET'S SELL THIS.
LET'S MOVE ON.

40:09.442 --> 40:10.577
THE OPPORTUNITY'S HERE.

40:10.610 --> 40:16.182
TAKE THAT MONEY,
PAY OFF YOUR LOANS...

40:16.216 --> 40:17.684
- GO 16.75.

40:17.717 --> 40:19.419
- 16.75.

40:19.452 --> 40:21.855
- BUT MAKE SURE HE UNDERSTANDS
IT'S THE FINAL OFFER.

40:21.888 --> 40:26.826
[phone line rings]

40:30.130 --> 40:32.766

THE BEST PENTHOUSE DOWNTOWN.

40:35.335 --> 40:38.104
16,750,000.

40:38.138 --> 40:40.040
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
COME UP TO THAT POINT.

40:40.073 --> 40:42.776
I CAN'T--
OTHERWISE, IT'S OVER.

40:42.809 --> 40:45.011
- 16.750?

40:45.045 --> 40:46.880
- CORRECT.

40:46.913 --> 40:51.351
- THAT'S THE WAY WE WANT IT?
ALL THE WORK IS DONE?

40:51.384 --> 40:56.389
- EVERYTHING DONE.

40:56.423 --> 40:58.725
MY HEART IS ABOUT
TO POP OUT OF MY CHEST.

40:58.758 --> 41:00.894
[imitates heartbeat]

41:04.230 --> 41:06.199
- ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT YOURSELF
A DEAL AT THAT PRICE.

41:06.232 --> 41:07.901
LET'S PUT IT TOGETHER.

41:07.934 --> 41:11.271
- GREAT. THANK YOU.

41:12.739 --> 41:15.308
WHOO! WE HAVE A DEAL,
EVERYBODY!

41:15.342 --> 41:17.377
IT'S 1/3 OF THE BUILDING.
WOW.

41:25.452 --> 41:29.289
- I'M ON MY WAY TO MEET ALEX
AT HIS APARTMENT, AND I--

41:29.322 --> 41:30.423
I HAVE TO GIVE HIM
AN ULTIMATUM.

41:30.457 --> 41:32.659
[door buzzer buzzes]

41:32.692 --> 41:35.261
- HEY. WHAT'S UP?
- YO. WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

41:35.295 --> 41:36.363
WHOO.

41:36.396 --> 41:39.766
IT'S GOTTA BE THE KANGAROO,
OR NEW APARTMENT.

41:39.799 --> 41:41.634
- ALL RIGHT, LET ME PUT HIM
DOWN, WE CAN TALK.

41:41.668 --> 41:44.871
- AND IDEALLY,
I'D WANT HIM TO MOVE,

41:44.904 --> 41:46.006
'CAUSE THAT'S
HOW I MAKE MONEY.

41:46.106 --> 41:50.110
THIS GUY
IS A PROBLEM, MAN.

41:50.110 --> 41:51.211
FINDING THE APARTMENT
THAT WORKS FOR YOU

41:51.244 --> 41:52.212
ISN'T THE PROBLEM.

41:52.245 --> 41:53.880
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW,

41:53.913 --> 41:56.883
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN GET YOU
THAT'S KANGAROO-FRIENDLY.

41:56.916 --> 42:00.220
SO I HONESTLY THINK
THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME,

42:00.253 --> 42:04.057
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S A QUESTION OF,
YOU KNOW,

42:04.090 --> 42:07.193
DO YOU WANT THE KANGAROO,
OR DO YOU WANT THE APARTMENT?

42:07.227 --> 42:10.897
- I OBVIOUSLY WANT
THE APARTMENT, BUT, YOU KNOW,

42:10.930 --> 42:12.332
I NEED THE KANGAROO.

42:12.365 --> 42:14.868
HE'S--YOU KNOW,
HE'S MY LIFE.

42:14.901 --> 42:16.202
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

42:16.236 --> 42:18.238
I--I THINK THAT MAYBE
WHAT WE SHOULD DO

42:18.271 --> 42:21.908
IS GO FOR JUST NOT MENTION HIM
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

42:21.941 --> 42:25.145
I DON'T KNOW,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

42:25.178 --> 42:26.413
- I CAN'T...

42:26.446 --> 42:27.614
I CAN'T DO THAT.

42:27.647 --> 42:30.083
IN REAL ESTATE,
YOUR REPUTATION IS EVERYTHING.

42:30.116 --> 42:32.585
AND I MEAN, LOOK, I'LL TAKE
CHANCES HERE AND THERE.

42:32.619 --> 42:34.921
BUT NEVER IF IT'S GONNA
COST ME MY RELATIONSHIP

42:34.954 --> 42:36.656
WITH A BUILDING'S OWNER
OR DEVELOPER.

42:36.690 --> 42:39.926
A SECOND OPTION
IS TO FIND YOU A TOWNHOUSE.

42:39.959 --> 42:41.594
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DEAL WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

42:41.628 --> 42:43.096
- HOW MUCH?

42:43.096 --> 42:43.963
- AROUND 7 MILLION.

42:43.997 --> 42:46.099
- THAT'S, UH--THAT'S--

42:46.132 --> 42:49.102
THAT'S QUITE A BIT MORE
THAN I'M ABLE TO DO RIGHT NOW.

42:49.135 --> 42:50.470
- YEAH.
- UM...

42:50.503 --> 42:52.105
- SO, MAYBE YOU DON'T
MAKE THE PURCHASE NOW.

42:52.138 --> 42:53.440
