WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:13.471 --> 00:15.515
Kirari, are you ready?

00:16.307 --> 00:17.934
Yes, let's go.

00:23.356 --> 00:26.860
The heads of each family
are gathered here today.

00:29.571 --> 00:32.949
All right, shall we begin?

02:10.755 --> 02:12.423
MITTENS

02:14.008 --> 02:15.635
Let's have an official match!

02:20.974 --> 02:22.559
Hold...

02:23.143 --> 02:25.186
Hold up a second!

02:25.270 --> 02:26.312
Yumeko- senpai!

02:26.396 --> 02:30.275
Weren't you saving your official match
to take on the student council president?

02:31.067 --> 02:32.235
What?

02:32.318 --> 02:35.155
Did I ever say such a thing, even once?

02:36.030 --> 02:37.657
Oh, crap, she didn't!

02:37.740 --> 02:41.035
My scheme to make Yumeko
the student council president...

02:42.453 --> 02:45.415
I'm not really the patient type, you see.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.460
Now, then, Manyuda...
let's get our gambling freak on!

02:52.714 --> 02:56.509
See? What did I tell you?
It's all proceeding without a hitch.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.846
That's precisely when you get the rug
pulled out from under you.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.931
Come on, now, Manyuda.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.854
All right, got it. I'll admit it.

03:07.937 --> 03:11.900
Clearly, I miscalculated.
I underestimated this woman.

03:12.525 --> 03:16.070
She was gambling
for the sake of gambling, I see.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.448
Yumeko Jabami is a compulsive gambler.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.492
Meaning she isn't affected
by the outcome.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.953
She's addicted to the concept
of gambling itself.

03:24.037 --> 03:28.374
In that case, it's simple. I'm going
to factor even that into my calculations.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.587
Fine by me. I accept your challenge
to an official match.

03:35.465 --> 03:39.802
How did it come to this?
The student council suffering two defeats

03:39.886 --> 03:42.513
while being live-streamed
to the entire student body?

03:42.597 --> 03:45.350
That should never happen, no matter what.

03:46.851 --> 03:50.813
On the other hand, Manyuda is most likely
the person behind Yumemite's downfall.

03:51.439 --> 03:55.235
If he wins, then a traitor like him
will only gain more power.

03:56.110 --> 03:58.780
And the student council
that our president built up

03:58.863 --> 04:01.950
will disintegrate
because of my incompetence.

04:02.533 --> 04:07.372
What are you gonna do about the rules?
You need to find a dealer.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.207
I'll be happy to be your dealer.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.255
What, the vice president?

04:16.965 --> 04:19.300
Fine by me. Decide on the rules.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.761
There's no time to elaborate.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.306
You'll compete in an original game
using playing cards.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.268
It's called "Choice Poker."

04:28.601 --> 04:31.729
The rules are basically the same
as those for poker.

04:31.813 --> 04:36.567
You'll be dealt five cards, which you'll
exchange one time only. Best hand wins.

04:37.402 --> 04:41.239
You'll be using a 53-card deck
with one joker.

04:41.322 --> 04:44.325
However, in this game,
you can neither fold nor call.

04:45.201 --> 04:48.288
Players will only be allowed
to bet or raise.

04:48.871 --> 04:52.250
You will compete
by showing your hand in each round,

04:52.333 --> 04:56.546
but the person who bets more money
will be given the right to choose.

04:56.629 --> 04:59.257
Choose? What do we get to choose?

04:59.340 --> 05:05.054
Stronger? Or weaker? Who has
the stronger hand or the weaker hand?

05:06.264 --> 05:08.224
In a normal poker game,

05:08.308 --> 05:11.019
needless to say,
the stronger hand of cards wins.

05:11.436 --> 05:15.023
But in this game,
the person who gains the right to choose

05:15.106 --> 05:18.985
can pick whether the stronger hand
or the weaker hand will win.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.071
If you choose "stronger,"
just as in normal poker,

05:22.155 --> 05:25.074
the person with the better hand wins.

05:25.158 --> 05:29.537
On the other hand, if you choose "weaker,"
the poker hand rankings are reversed,

05:30.038 --> 05:32.623
and the person with the weaker hand wins.

05:33.374 --> 05:37.795
If you bet more, even a garbage hand
can be elevated to the most powerful hand.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.256
Seems tailor-made for our school,
don't you think?

05:40.339 --> 05:43.968
That's the rules. There's no limit
to how much money you can bet.

05:44.052 --> 05:47.305
- Let's see you go down to the wire.
- I see.

05:47.388 --> 05:50.767
Even if you have a weak hand,
you can win if you bet right.

05:51.350 --> 05:52.977
The rules are simple.

05:53.061 --> 05:56.314
The only thing that sets it apart
is the rankings getting reversed.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.483
What kind of rules are those?

05:59.067 --> 06:01.569
This isn't good.
To think they'd be so obvious...

06:01.652 --> 06:03.154
Huh? About what?

06:03.237 --> 06:04.572
Don't you see it?

06:04.655 --> 06:08.284
No matter how you slice it, the rules put
Yumeko at an overwhelming disadvantage.

06:09.285 --> 06:14.415
- Her chances of winning are slim.
- Do either of you have any objections?

06:14.499 --> 06:15.792
- No.
- Fine by me.

06:16.375 --> 06:19.295
All right.
Let's begin this game of Choice Poker.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.633
The odds are against Yumeko? How so?

06:24.425 --> 06:28.805
In normal poker, the person
with more money has the edge.

06:29.931 --> 06:33.935
With more funds, you can put pressure
on your opponent by raising.

06:34.602 --> 06:37.271
If you intimidate your opponent
into folding,

06:37.355 --> 06:39.732
you can win regardless of your hand.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.444
Poker is known as the game
where you make your opponent fold.

06:44.070 --> 06:50.034
But in this game, you can compete even if
you don't have the same amount of funds.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.788
- But you lose the right to choose.
- That's the killer blow.

06:54.372 --> 07:00.920
The player who gets to choose can always
twist the rules to his or her own benefit.

07:01.003 --> 07:06.384
Only one player gets a steady stream
of strong hands in this game.

07:06.968 --> 07:13.015
I'd never agree to play this game
unless I was sure I had more money.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.684
Even an idiot could see that.

07:14.767 --> 07:18.813
But Yumeko has a ton of money on her,
doesn't she?

07:21.357 --> 07:24.026
You really shouldn't underestimate
the student council.

07:25.111 --> 07:29.282
One chip will be worth ten million yen.
How many do you want?

07:29.866 --> 07:35.246
Since I have 310 million yen in cash,
I'd like to request 31 chips.

07:36.080 --> 07:36.914
Manyuda?

07:37.498 --> 07:39.500
Let's see, for starters...

07:40.918 --> 07:42.170
I'll buy 100 chips.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.672
- No way.
- A hundred?

07:44.755 --> 07:45.798
One billion?

07:45.882 --> 07:49.719
That's way too reckless.
The gap in funds is overwhelming.

07:49.802 --> 07:53.222
I'm pretty sure Manyuda- senpai
still has a lot to tap into.

07:53.806 --> 07:54.932
Yumeko...

07:58.978 --> 08:02.732
First, your participation fee.
Each of you will throw in one chip.

08:04.734 --> 08:08.946
How do we determine which hand will win
if we both get high card hands?

08:09.030 --> 08:11.824
Since one doesn't really try
to get a weaker card...

08:11.908 --> 08:16.287
If you both get high card hands, whoever
has one more higher-ranking card wins.

08:17.079 --> 08:19.999
If one hand features a king
and other cards,

08:20.082 --> 08:22.585
and the other includes a ten
and other cards,

08:22.668 --> 08:23.878
the king is stronger.

08:24.462 --> 08:27.298
Oh, that's right. Thank you very much.

08:27.381 --> 08:31.344
What a phony. Broadcasting your intent
to go for a high card hand... So cunning.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.347
All right.
I'm going to exchange two cards.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.307
Swap one for me.

08:36.891 --> 08:40.269
Your hands are now established.
Let's move on to betting.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.814
Jabami discarded a king and a jack.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.817
If she's going for a weaker hand,

08:47.401 --> 08:50.655
it's only natural that she would discard
her higher-ranking cards.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.198
However...

08:52.281 --> 08:57.036
you can't rule out the possibility
that she has a three-of-a-kind.

08:57.620 --> 09:01.290
Even if her hand is garbage,
she might have an ace.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.293
She's pretending to hope
for a weaker hand

09:04.377 --> 09:07.672
to make me choose a stronger hand.

09:08.422 --> 09:11.551
My hand's garbage.
It fell short of a straight.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.220
What's Jabami gunning for...
stronger or weaker?

09:15.054 --> 09:18.599
I need more information for
my calculations. I'm going to test you.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.727
- I'll bet ten chips.
- Ten?

09:21.811 --> 09:26.732
- One hundred million right off the bat?
- Jabami, are you going to raise him?

09:29.777 --> 09:35.908
- I raise you ten chips for a total of 21.
- Yumeko has 31 chips in all.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.619
If she loses,
she'll be left with less than half.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.746
Manyuda? Raise?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.206
No need for that.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.126
Since she bet more,
Jabami has the right to choose.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.087
Stronger hand or weaker hand?

09:48.170 --> 09:50.464
Well, let me see...

09:50.548 --> 09:52.800
Let's go with the stronger hand.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.510
Stronger hand.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.846
Now, then... showdown!

09:59.390 --> 10:01.225
- High card.
- High card.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.977
High card for both players.

10:03.060 --> 10:06.022
Since she has an ace,
Jabami is the winner.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.900
All right!
That gives her a little breathing room.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.530
Now, let's move on to the next round.

10:17.199 --> 10:21.996
Oh, my, what shall I do? It's so difficult
when you're not familiar with the rules.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.998
Now, I know what makes you tick.

10:24.081 --> 10:28.294
Unlike regular poker,
huge raises are pointless.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.547
If you raise one more chip
than your opponent,

10:31.631 --> 10:33.799
you earn the right to choose.

10:34.884 --> 10:39.263
For that reason, we should
be trading raises one chip at a time.

10:40.056 --> 10:43.351
The only point of a huge raise
is the intimidation factor,

10:43.434 --> 10:45.227
but it's pointless against an opponent

10:45.728 --> 10:48.522
with the financial means
to raise you by one.

10:48.606 --> 10:52.777
When all is said and done, you couldn't
justify the risk for such a move.

10:53.361 --> 10:57.031
But even so,
Yumeko Jabami went with such a move...

10:57.615 --> 10:59.283
because she's crazy.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.745
Because this woman derives pleasure
every time she takes a risk.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.831
If I hadn't heard about her beforehand,

11:05.915 --> 11:09.335
I might've been deceived
by her irrational behavior.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.255
Now, I can factor in
Jabami's eccentric conduct.

11:13.339 --> 11:18.260
Thank you,
Nishinotouin, Ikishima, Yumemite.

11:21.639 --> 11:25.184
Thank you for serving as my launching pad.

11:29.063 --> 11:33.526
As far as chips go, Yumeko has 42.
Manyuda has 89.

11:34.110 --> 11:38.030
She's so close to turning the tables.
Yumeko is sure to win.

11:38.489 --> 11:43.452
She's won so many gambles against
bleak odds. It's the same this time.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.914
I'm sure she'll win by some method
I'd never even think of.

11:47.498 --> 11:48.582
Exchange cards?

11:48.666 --> 11:52.878
Hmm... let's see.
All right, I'll exchange two.

11:56.006 --> 11:58.134
- She's swapping a pair of tens?
- What?

11:58.551 --> 12:01.554
- Why would she discard a pair?
- I don't get it.

12:01.637 --> 12:06.142
I can think of two possibilities.
One, she's going for a high card hand.

12:06.934 --> 12:09.395
But that would give me the right
to choose.

12:09.854 --> 12:13.691
It would be suicidal to show me
that she's trying for a weaker hand.

12:13.774 --> 12:18.863
Two, she had two pairs in her first hand,
or she was dealt a full house.

12:18.946 --> 12:22.992
Pretending to go for a high card hand,
she'll make me choose "stronger"

12:23.075 --> 12:27.037
and win with either
the three-of-a-kind she has or one pair.

12:27.621 --> 12:32.042
But the odds of her having been
initially dealt two pairs is 4.31 percent.

12:32.126 --> 12:35.129
As for a full house,
the odds would be 0.23 percent.

12:35.212 --> 12:39.633
Even if she did receive such
a valuable hand, would she discard it?

12:40.217 --> 12:47.016
She'd stand a much better chance waiting
and hoping I'd pick "stronger."

12:47.600 --> 12:49.560
In other words,
Jabami's actions are unbelievable,

12:49.643 --> 12:53.397
because getting such a first hand
is so unlikely

12:53.481 --> 12:55.274
and there'd be no point in bluffing.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.402
If she were a normal opponent,

12:59.278 --> 13:02.406
me sitting at this table,
gambling with Yumeko Jabami...

13:02.490 --> 13:04.116
This situation would never happen.

13:05.784 --> 13:10.498
I've heard about how she beat student
council members with unexpected methods.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.917
Because this woman is so unbelievable...

13:13.501 --> 13:17.254
- Manyuda, what are you going to do?
- ...I'm gonna get her.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.714
You're exchanging five cards?

13:18.797 --> 13:19.673
No.

13:21.383 --> 13:22.760
I'm not exchanging any.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.845
- What?
- Hey, you haven't chosen yet.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.139
He's luring Yumeko into betting.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.184
If Yumeko gets
the right to choose now, she'll win.

13:30.267 --> 13:33.771
If she takes the right to choose,
she'll have bet a lot.

13:33.854 --> 13:37.525
On the other hand,
if Yumeko- senpai  doesn't like her hand,

13:37.608 --> 13:39.026
she should just fold.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.487
She can only compete with a good hand.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.532
What the heck
is Manyuda- senpai  doing, anyway?

13:45.074 --> 13:46.867
Such a risky move he's making...

13:47.451 --> 13:48.369
What a moron.

13:53.207 --> 13:56.752
I like that. Is this your way
of throwing down a challenge?

13:56.835 --> 13:59.171
Showing such swagger
leaves me no choice but to...

13:59.255 --> 14:01.840
give as good as I'm getting, you know.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.927
I'm going to bet 41 chips.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.429
You're betting everything?
Why is this happening?

14:08.013 --> 14:11.183
Just as I thought. He's totally
figured out Yumeko's personality.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.186
I raise one chip.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.273
- Jabami, your turn.
- I have nothing.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.484
- Manyuda, make your choice.
- Stronger hand.

14:20.568 --> 14:24.488
He answered right away. I admit,
even I'd go with the stronger hand.

14:24.572 --> 14:29.368
Since Yumeko tossed her pair of tens,
odds are that her hand is weak.

14:29.451 --> 14:31.537
This is a classic, by-the-book move.

14:32.121 --> 14:37.459
No, I'm going to put my faith in Yumeko.
If Yumeko loses, I'll be finished, too.

14:38.002 --> 14:42.590
- The only option is to win.
- That's it for the betting phase. Now...

14:44.592 --> 14:45.718
Show...

14:47.177 --> 14:48.012
...down!

14:52.391 --> 14:55.269
It's garbage. Too bad.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.478
What?

14:56.562 --> 14:58.355
- Yumeko lost.
- Are you kidding me?

14:58.439 --> 14:59.440
Huh? Garbage?

14:59.523 --> 15:02.526
What the hell are you doing,
Yumeko Jabami?

15:03.444 --> 15:06.822
The only way I could get back
on the student council

15:06.906 --> 15:09.491
and take over the family business
was if you won.

15:10.409 --> 15:13.454
It's over. It's all over for me.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.957
I see.
So, you were going for a straight.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.251
There's no way that would've happened.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.463
I totally didn't see that coming. But...

15:22.546 --> 15:26.884
I did factor in the fact that this woman
would make an unexpected move.

15:26.967 --> 15:31.430
Anyone taking on Yumeko Jabami
as a normal person is destined to lose.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.725
"Since she's betting
a whopping 410 million yen,

15:34.808 --> 15:37.019
she must have something
up her sleeve."

15:37.102 --> 15:41.482
That's the thought that pulls the wool
over their eyes. But not me.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.692
I always walk the high road.

15:44.401 --> 15:48.489
From the start, this was a gamble stacked
in my favor because I have money.

15:48.906 --> 15:53.577
If I don't let her trick me and walk
the high road, there's no way I can lose.

15:54.286 --> 15:59.875
Yumeko Jabami,
even you weren't a match for me.

16:01.043 --> 16:04.171
This game is over.
And it's all over for you.

16:05.381 --> 16:09.802
Jabami, you're out of chips.
Do you wish to continue playing?

16:09.885 --> 16:10.803
What?

16:14.848 --> 16:17.309
Sumeragi, do you mind?

16:18.102 --> 16:19.269
Me?

16:21.689 --> 16:22.982
How much can you offer?

16:27.945 --> 16:29.655
Sumeragi, what do you think?

16:29.738 --> 16:31.615
Well...

16:31.699 --> 16:35.369
The other day,
you said you wanted to be my friend.

16:35.452 --> 16:38.789
You said you wanted me
to become the student council President.

16:38.872 --> 16:42.167
Friends help other friends in need, right?

16:42.835 --> 16:48.382
I've exhausted my funds, and I don't know
what to do. Can you help me out?

16:49.758 --> 16:53.095
Sumeragi, now that you've been abandoned
by the student council president,

16:53.178 --> 16:54.972
have you aligned yourself with Jabami?

16:56.140 --> 16:59.476
Give it up.
I can still let you off the hook.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.521
Or do you want to antagonize
the student council?

17:03.564 --> 17:06.150
It'd be just like you to make such a move.

17:06.775 --> 17:10.487
That's why I recommended you
as a member of the student council.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.533
Ambition. The will to claw your way
to the top, no matter what.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.368
I discovered that in you.

17:17.244 --> 17:20.122
Ambition is the foundation
of effort and growth.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.958
It's crucial for anyone
who wants to be a leader.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.336
And it's the thing
you and I have in common.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.716
To be honest, I felt something
close to affinity towards you.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.718
Manyuda- senpai...

17:32.801 --> 17:33.677
However...

17:33.761 --> 17:38.348
you didn't have the competence
to realize your ambitions.

17:38.807 --> 17:44.021
You were in over your head.
Competence equals results.

17:44.646 --> 17:47.483
As a loser, it's something you lack.

17:47.566 --> 17:52.279
Give it up. You're not qualified
to walk the high road.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.073
I know.

17:54.156 --> 17:57.743
I don't mind mediating to get you back
on the student council.

17:58.786 --> 18:03.165
If you realize what you're capable of,
there should be a use for you.

18:03.832 --> 18:06.126
Come on back, Sumeragi.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.837
- I--
- Oh, my...

18:08.921 --> 18:10.756
That's quite a choice of words.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.510
You say that Sumeragi is incompetent?

18:14.593 --> 18:17.346
Who on earth ever decided such a thing?

18:17.429 --> 18:22.768
Even if that were true, why would that be
a reason for her to give up her ambition?

18:22.851 --> 18:25.312
Because it's for her own good.

18:25.395 --> 18:28.774
No matter how hard an incompetent person
tries, she can't produce results.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.652
She'll only make the situation worse.

18:31.735 --> 18:35.614
Those efforts are worth nothing.
She's better off giving up.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.450
I don't know about that.

18:38.534 --> 18:41.745
Sumeragi can decide what her own worth is.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.289
Sumeragi,

18:44.373 --> 18:48.335
in order to acquire something,
you must first offer something.

18:48.919 --> 18:52.548
Athletes give up their youth
to devote themselves to practice,

18:52.631 --> 18:55.509
and businessmen offer collateral
to borrow money.

18:56.093 --> 18:59.972
In order to realize one's ambition,
you must take on some risk.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.475
The bigger your ambition,
the greater the risk.

19:03.559 --> 19:08.480
That might mean time or the kind of effort
that shaves years off your life.

19:08.564 --> 19:12.276
This time, it only happens to be money.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.485
Now, then...

19:14.153 --> 19:15.779
please make your choice!

19:16.363 --> 19:20.868
Either take the safe route, or strive
for the summit by risking destruction.

19:20.951 --> 19:23.495
The choice is yours to make...

19:24.079 --> 19:27.332
- Sumeragi.
- What should I do?

19:28.083 --> 19:31.211
If I align myself with Manyuda- senpai ,
I can get back on the council,

19:31.295 --> 19:33.839
and then I can take over
my family's business.

19:33.922 --> 19:37.342
If I align myself with Yumeko,
I'll be fine if she wins.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.678
But if she loses, it'll destroy me.

19:39.761 --> 19:42.973
What should I do?
What am I supposed to do?

19:43.557 --> 19:46.518
- You want to join the student council?
- Yes.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.771
Have you seen
the previous donation rankings?

19:50.272 --> 19:52.316
That should prove my resolve.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.903
- You should back off.
- What? Why should I?

19:56.486 --> 19:58.947
You're only after the privileges
student council members get.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.452
I admit it's true that the current
council's authority is staggering.

20:03.535 --> 20:07.456
We can wrest all the money and prestige
we want from the students.

20:08.040 --> 20:12.628
Nobody can resist. The student council
rules over every facet of this academy.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.755
I know that perfectly well.

20:14.838 --> 20:18.467
There are tons of people
who want to join the student council.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.094
But I happen to have money.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.681
I'm someone who can contribute
to the student council.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.434
If necessary, I can get you even more.

20:27.517 --> 20:33.190
As expected, you don't get it.
The student council rules this school.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.900
On the flip side,

20:34.983 --> 20:37.653
it's bound to assume responsibility
for all facets of this academy.

20:38.487 --> 20:42.491
How many alumni do you think are
now central figures in Japanese society?

20:42.991 --> 20:46.036
They have high expectations for
this school. They're watching us closely.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.498
If we let them down,
it will mean the end for us.

20:50.082 --> 20:54.461
You should assume that every path
to your future life will be blocked.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.922
The student council carries all that
on its shoulders.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.925
Are you prepared to take that on?

21:01.843 --> 21:05.847
If I've gotten through to you, leave.
You're better off as an ordinary student.

21:07.849 --> 21:10.060
I want to become
student council president.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.437
What?

21:12.521 --> 21:16.525
My father has ordered me
to become a member of the student council.

21:17.150 --> 21:23.240
But I don't want to be just a member.
I want to be king.

21:23.323 --> 21:26.118
And I can risk everything to achieve that.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.079
You can't let the alumni down?

21:29.162 --> 21:31.790
Assume responsibility?
Bring it on, I say!

21:32.374 --> 21:35.252
I'm willing to do anything
to become student council president.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.462
Still not enough for you?

21:41.341 --> 21:43.802
We're the same... you and I.

21:45.595 --> 21:48.098
True, it's quite a hefty donation.

21:48.181 --> 21:50.058
Your record is impeccable, too.

21:50.767 --> 21:53.895
Fine, then.
I'll recommend you to the others.

21:54.980 --> 21:59.359
You and I will become kings.
I hope you're prepared, Itsuki Sumeragi.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.320
Yes!

22:02.195 --> 22:04.031
I thought that he'd acknowledge me.

22:04.614 --> 22:08.160
As comrades with the same goal,
sharing the same secrets,

22:08.744 --> 22:13.081
as co-conspirators in our arrogant quest
to become student council president,

22:13.165 --> 22:15.459
I thought that we were kindred spirits.

22:16.918 --> 22:18.378
But I was wrong.

22:18.962 --> 22:24.551
I was nothing but another pawn to him.
Discarded the moment he had no use for me.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.888
He'd been looking down on me
all this time.

22:29.306 --> 22:30.932
Now, then, Sumeragi...

22:31.892 --> 22:35.145
get your gambling freak on with me.

22:36.188 --> 22:41.359
I'll get my revenge! 100 chips!
Please add one billion yen to her pot!

22:41.443 --> 22:42.652
THE GIRL WHO CHOOSES

22:44.613 --> 22:47.574
I'm the one who's gonna become king!

24:20.417 --> 24:23.587
- Come on back, Sumeragi.
- I'm about to start seething.

24:23.670 --> 24:28.216
- What are they saying?
- In order to win, I'll do anything!

24:28.300 --> 24:31.011
EPISODE 11:
THE GIRL WHO WOULD STAKE HER LIFE
