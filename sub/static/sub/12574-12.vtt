00:53.622 --> 00:55.726
Good morning to you, sir.

00:55.727 --> 00:58.332
What may I interest you
in today?

00:58.333 --> 01:02.173
How about a rare map

01:02.174 --> 01:03.810
of the Thelusian Plains? Hm?

01:03.811 --> 01:06.517
Or perhaps an elixir

01:06.518 --> 01:09.457
known to restore stoutness

01:09.458 --> 01:11.059
to the aging gentleman?

01:11.060 --> 01:13.832
I'm not buying.

01:15.838 --> 01:18.975
I'm selling.
Hm.

01:18.976 --> 01:22.315
These items are from my family's
personal collection.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.886
Then I'm sure they have
sentimental value to you, sir,

01:24.887 --> 01:28.860
but they are
of no interest to me.

01:28.861 --> 01:30.029
Uh, forgive me.

01:30.030 --> 01:31.965
I should have introduced myself.

01:31.966 --> 01:35.872
Thaddicus Zorander, son of
the great Carracticus Zorander

01:35.873 --> 01:38.009
and brother of the only living
Wizard of the First Order

01:38.010 --> 01:41.982
in all the Midlands,
Zeddicus Z'ul Zorander.

01:51.399 --> 01:53.334
After you.

01:56.874 --> 02:00.245
A wizard demonstrates
the full majesty of his powers,

02:00.246 --> 02:03.650
and those dearest to him can't
even manage an "ooh" or an "ah?"

02:03.651 --> 02:06.220
Thanks for moving
the tree, Zedd.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.430
Please, wait!

02:20.140 --> 02:21.341
Are you the Seeker?

02:21.342 --> 02:23.544
Yes.
Thank the Spirits.

02:23.545 --> 02:26.114
The constable in Dewith told me
you were headed this way.

02:26.115 --> 02:28.551
It's all right. Catch your
breath. Come on, sit down.

02:28.552 --> 02:29.586
What happened?

02:29.587 --> 02:30.954
Two days ago,

02:30.955 --> 02:32.957
men kidnapped my husband.

02:32.958 --> 02:35.627
They took other people
from our village too.

02:35.628 --> 02:36.628
Who were these men?

02:36.629 --> 02:37.963
I don't know.

02:37.964 --> 02:39.899
We were in the field,
bringing in the harvest.

02:39.900 --> 02:41.668
They came with swords and clubs

02:41.669 --> 02:43.170
and grabbed as many
as they could

02:43.171 --> 02:45.239
and rode off with them
in a wagon.

02:45.240 --> 02:48.243
Maybe you haven't heard,
but the Seeker is on a quest.

02:48.244 --> 02:50.880
Perhaps this constable
of yours can help you.

02:50.881 --> 02:53.250
Cara.
The constable can't help us.

02:53.251 --> 02:55.719
He's got his hands full fighting
the banelings.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.254
Banelings?

02:57.255 --> 03:00.624
There seem to more of them
in our valley every day.

03:00.625 --> 03:03.361
Could banelings have abducted
these people for some reason?

03:03.362 --> 03:05.731
Banelings don't kidnap people,
they kill them.

03:05.732 --> 03:09.402
Yes, but they have to do it
every single day to stay alive.

03:09.403 --> 03:10.903
Maybe they're stocking up
on victims.

03:10.904 --> 03:13.507
If you take us to where
your husband was grabbed,

03:13.508 --> 03:14.909
we can pick up the trail
of the wagon.

03:14.910 --> 03:16.910
That will take days.

03:16.911 --> 03:18.779
We'll get back to looking
for the Stone of Tears.

03:18.780 --> 03:22.016
Right now,
this woman needs our help.

03:27.055 --> 03:28.155
Worthless.

03:32.495 --> 03:34.430
Rancid.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.004
"Shadow Water."

03:45.510 --> 03:47.712
Shadow Water.

03:51.484 --> 03:53.786
Shadow Water.

03:53.787 --> 03:56.222
Hm. No.

03:56.223 --> 03:58.324
Well, the contents
are worthless,

03:58.325 --> 04:00.326
but the bottle
has a certain appeal.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.095
I can always use a little cruet
for my potions.

04:02.096 --> 04:04.097
I can give you, say,
10 farthings.

04:04.098 --> 04:05.299
If it was worthless,

04:05.300 --> 04:08.803
you wouldn't offer me
even 10 farthings.

04:08.804 --> 04:11.307
And my father wouldn't have
saved so much of it.

04:11.308 --> 04:14.042
There's hardly two spoonfuls.
Do you think I'm a fool?

04:14.043 --> 04:16.209
I had a feeling this
was the cream of the crop,

04:16.211 --> 04:17.877
so I only brought a sample.

04:17.878 --> 04:19.344
There's more?

04:19.345 --> 04:21.512
My father saved 50 jars.

04:21.512 --> 04:22.646
Where are they?

04:22.647 --> 04:24.981
First tell me why
it's so valuable.

04:26.950 --> 04:30.486
If I tell you, you might decide
you don't need me anymore.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.154
How much will you pay?

04:32.155 --> 04:33.655
One gold piece per jar.

04:33.656 --> 04:34.889
Then you think you
can charge

04:34.890 --> 04:36.357
your customers
considerably more.

04:36.358 --> 04:38.525
All right.

04:38.526 --> 04:40.259
Two gold pieces a jar.

04:40.260 --> 04:43.729
I have a better idea.

04:43.730 --> 04:44.897
We'll be partners.

04:49.835 --> 04:51.002
Are those the men?

04:51.003 --> 04:52.102
Yes.

04:52.103 --> 04:53.337
But there's no one in the wagon.

04:53.338 --> 04:54.939
Where's my husband?

04:54.940 --> 04:58.542
Stay here while we find out.

04:58.543 --> 04:59.910
Stop right there!

04:59.911 --> 05:02.078
What happened to the people
who were in this wagon?

05:03.713 --> 05:04.879
Get rid of them.

05:37.577 --> 05:39.644
Cara, the driver!

05:58.960 --> 06:00.226
Kahlan!

06:00.227 --> 06:02.128
I'm all right.

06:40.296 --> 06:41.963
Tell me what you did
with the captives.

06:41.964 --> 06:43.131
All right!

06:43.132 --> 06:45.767
We handed them over
to another driver.

06:45.768 --> 06:47.535
He's taking them to a farmhouse

06:47.536 --> 06:50.704
on the old forest road
in Gurdoone.

06:50.705 --> 06:53.673
But they'll be dead long
before anyone finds them.

07:23.664 --> 07:25.564
Rahl!

07:32.438 --> 07:34.470
Darken Rahl!

07:34.471 --> 07:36.371
Cara.

07:38.607 --> 07:40.607
How delightful.

07:40.608 --> 07:42.342
I knew it was only a matter
of time

07:42.343 --> 07:45.544
before your misguided loyalty
to the Seeker got you killed.

07:45.545 --> 07:47.045
I want the deal.

07:48.447 --> 07:49.914
I beg your pardon?

07:49.915 --> 07:51.215
You heard me.

07:51.216 --> 07:55.152
I'm willing to kill for you.

07:55.153 --> 07:58.655
Make me a baneling.

08:05.302 --> 08:07.269
So...

08:07.270 --> 08:09.871
you want to be a baneling.

08:09.872 --> 08:12.907
Send me back,
and I'll serve the Keeper.

08:12.908 --> 08:17.343
And miss out on the pleasure

08:17.344 --> 08:19.545
of tormenting you
for an eternity?

08:19.546 --> 08:22.947
I'm only one soul.

08:22.948 --> 08:25.983
Think of all the others
I could provide for you.

08:25.984 --> 08:31.453
Yes, you always
had a nose for blood, Cara.

08:31.454 --> 08:33.955
But perhaps you're forgetting
the fact that you betrayed me,

08:33.956 --> 08:36.624
that you helped
the Seeker to kill me.

08:36.625 --> 08:39.326
And now you want me to trust you

08:39.327 --> 08:41.595
to uphold your end of a bargain?

08:41.596 --> 08:45.498
If I don't honor the agreement,

08:45.499 --> 08:48.769
you can call me back here

08:48.770 --> 08:51.838
to face the Keeper's wrath.

08:51.839 --> 08:53.772
True.

08:53.773 --> 08:57.943
But if I give you a second life,

08:57.944 --> 09:01.414
you will just go back
to helping Richard.

09:01.415 --> 09:05.919
He and I aren't exactly
on friendly terms.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.857
You know I kill people
to protect Richard.

09:09.858 --> 09:12.893
Many.

09:12.894 --> 09:15.764
What does it matter why I do it,

09:15.765 --> 09:18.066
as long as I do it?

09:18.067 --> 09:20.699
Yes, the Seeker
and his merry band

09:20.700 --> 09:23.567
are some of the Keeper's
finest suppliers of souls.

09:23.568 --> 09:26.404
But you delude yourself

09:26.405 --> 09:30.641
into believing you're killing
to defeat evil.

09:30.642 --> 09:34.545
My banelings have
to kill every day.

09:34.546 --> 09:38.248
What happens when you run out
of bad people?

09:38.249 --> 09:40.483
I don't think the Seeker
would appreciate

09:40.484 --> 09:41.951
you killing the good ones.

09:41.952 --> 09:43.419
That will be my problem.

09:43.420 --> 09:45.921
It certainly will.

09:49.391 --> 09:51.725
Do you understand the rules?

09:51.726 --> 09:53.494
If I keep killing, I stay alive.

09:53.495 --> 09:55.328
Only living people.
No banelings.

09:55.329 --> 09:58.698
Their souls already belong
to the Keeper.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.166
And you can't get ahead.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.035
Ahead?
I'm sure it's occurred to you

10:04.036 --> 10:05.435
that you could kill six or seven

10:05.436 --> 10:08.605
irredeemable miscreants

10:08.606 --> 10:11.875
and stay healthy
for a week at a time.

10:11.876 --> 10:14.010
But it doesn't work that way.

10:14.011 --> 10:16.478
Every time you kill,

10:16.479 --> 10:19.715
the clock begins to tick again.

10:19.716 --> 10:21.916
And don't think
because you're Mord-Sith

10:21.917 --> 10:23.818
you will have
a special advantage.

10:23.819 --> 10:25.886
As a baneling,

10:25.887 --> 10:29.023
you will no longer
have the Breath of Life.

10:29.024 --> 10:30.625
You won't be able
to kill someone,

10:30.626 --> 10:32.293
only to revive them.

10:32.294 --> 10:35.396
I understand.

10:35.397 --> 10:36.964
Now send me back.

10:41.603 --> 10:43.971
Patience

10:43.972 --> 10:48.276
never was one of your
strong suits, Cara.

10:50.345 --> 10:53.514
Do we have a deal

10:53.515 --> 10:56.582
or not?

11:05.424 --> 11:07.324
You couldn't
at least stay alive long enough

11:07.325 --> 11:08.725
for me to come back
and kill you.

11:18.166 --> 11:19.232
Why do you have to burn them?

11:19.233 --> 11:20.533
If we destroy their bodies,

11:20.534 --> 11:21.767
they can't become banelings.

11:24.735 --> 11:27.436
Cara, are you all right?

11:27.437 --> 11:29.670
I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?

11:29.671 --> 11:31.705
Your neck.

11:35.041 --> 11:36.942
It's the driver's blood.

11:36.943 --> 11:38.343
I had to kill him.

11:38.344 --> 11:41.712
But not before he told me where
the kidnapped people were taken.

11:41.713 --> 11:44.447
A farmhouse near Gurdoone.

11:44.448 --> 11:45.548
Did he say why?

11:45.549 --> 11:48.350
No.

11:48.351 --> 11:50.752
Just that they
wouldn't survive long.

11:54.956 --> 11:58.158
<i>My banelings have</i>
<i>to kill every day.</i>

12:00.061 --> 12:02.728
What about him?

12:02.729 --> 12:04.964
I confessed him.

12:04.965 --> 12:07.199
He was only paid
to help round up the captives.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.067
And they were loaded
into another wagon.

12:09.068 --> 12:11.035
He didn't know where they
were going, or why.

12:11.036 --> 12:13.871
Then he's of no use to us.

12:13.872 --> 12:15.639
I'll kill him.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.474
Cara, we're not going
to execute him.

12:18.475 --> 12:21.110
The driver said we wouldn't find
the captives alive.

12:21.111 --> 12:22.478
If that's true,

12:22.479 --> 12:24.446
he helped kill them.

12:24.447 --> 12:25.881
He deserves to die for that.

12:29.251 --> 12:31.919
Go home. Find honest work.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.186
And never take up arms again

12:33.187 --> 12:34.721
unless it's to protect
an innocent life.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.591
Yes, mistress.

12:41.194 --> 12:45.163
Now let's find out
what's happening in Gurdoone.

13:32.139 --> 13:33.271
Who's next?

13:33.272 --> 13:35.205
I am. Please, hurry.

13:35.206 --> 13:37.306
I don't have much time before
the Keeper calls me back.

13:37.307 --> 13:39.141
You should have come
to me sooner.

13:39.142 --> 13:41.710
It took all day
to get the money.

13:41.711 --> 13:44.779
She's weak.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.280
Get her a small one.

13:51.051 --> 13:52.652
No.

13:52.653 --> 13:55.888
No! Please!

13:55.889 --> 13:57.055
No!

13:57.056 --> 13:58.056
Please don't!

14:03.295 --> 14:05.395
May the Creator forgive me.

14:09.633 --> 14:12.034
No! Please don't!

14:29.883 --> 14:33.650
<i>Only living people, Cara.</i>
<i>No banelings.</i>

14:33.651 --> 14:35.752
<i>Their souls already belong</i>
<i>to the Keeper.</i>

14:40.022 --> 14:42.723
Richard, behind you!

15:07.710 --> 15:09.177
Quickly.

15:11.847 --> 15:13.447
Let's get these people out
of here.

15:13.448 --> 15:14.849
Thank you.

15:14.850 --> 15:16.885
Come on.

15:16.886 --> 15:20.122
What were all
you banelings doing here?

15:20.123 --> 15:21.858
Buying people to kill.

15:23.628 --> 15:25.428
She'll be a rotting corpse soon.

15:25.429 --> 15:27.230
Take her away,
so these people

15:27.231 --> 15:28.832
don't have to see any more
death.

15:34.538 --> 15:36.872
Gavin!

15:44.146 --> 15:45.645
Bless you, Seeker.

15:54.921 --> 15:57.856
How long do you think
you can fool your friends?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.193
I tried to hide it too.

16:02.194 --> 16:03.895
But you can't stop
the skin from rotting.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.563
Or ignore the hunger.

16:05.564 --> 16:07.297
Quiet.
Or what?

16:07.298 --> 16:09.433
You'll kill me?

16:09.434 --> 16:13.102
Don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

16:13.103 --> 16:15.637
After all, you're one of us.

16:15.638 --> 16:17.872
I'm nothing like you.

16:19.241 --> 16:20.541
I took the Keeper's bargain

16:20.542 --> 16:21.776
because there was no one else

16:21.777 --> 16:24.645
to care for my sick daughter.

16:24.646 --> 16:26.014
Why did you do it?

16:26.015 --> 16:28.583
Everybody has a reason.

16:28.584 --> 16:30.485
And when you have to kill,

16:30.486 --> 16:34.088
it's good to remind yourself
why you're doing it.

16:34.089 --> 16:35.723
Tell me.

16:38.726 --> 16:41.392
I did it to stay alive
to protect the Seeker.

16:45.695 --> 16:48.429
There might be a way you
don't have to keep killing.

16:51.033 --> 16:53.301
What way?

16:53.302 --> 16:56.370
Only ten gold pieces buys you
a soul-saving sip

16:56.371 --> 17:00.106
of the remarkable remedy,
the complete cure,

17:00.107 --> 17:02.308
the magical
malady-destroying mouthful

17:02.309 --> 17:03.810
which will ever-after eradicate

17:03.811 --> 17:05.377
the appalling affliction

17:05.378 --> 17:07.413
which perennially plagues you,

17:07.414 --> 17:10.781
you, you and you.

17:31.665 --> 17:32.799
Get out of the way!

17:32.800 --> 17:33.801
Give me one!

17:36.338 --> 17:39.240
We're gonna be rich,
partner.

17:39.819 --> 17:42.419
There's a rumor that a magic
peddler in South Caston

17:42.420 --> 17:44.354
has been selling a cure
for a few days now.

17:44.355 --> 17:45.856
It's not far.

17:45.857 --> 17:46.957
I can take her.

17:46.958 --> 17:48.058
We'll all go.

17:48.059 --> 17:49.326
Richard, if this magic peddler

17:49.327 --> 17:51.594
is who I think it is,
we've dealt with him before.

17:51.595 --> 17:53.462
He's not to be trusted.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.764
Maybe we shouldn't delay
the search for the Stone,

17:55.765 --> 17:56.764
based on a rumor.

17:56.765 --> 17:58.599
If this cure is real,

17:58.600 --> 18:00.001
and we can get it
to the banelings,

18:00.002 --> 18:01.535
they won't have to kill anymore.

18:01.536 --> 18:03.637
We don't know how long it will
to take to find the Stone,

18:03.638 --> 18:06.472
but we would be saving a lot
of lives in the meantime.

18:06.473 --> 18:09.242
Let's go.
It's too late for me.

18:09.243 --> 18:12.078
I've only got
a few heartbeats left.

18:12.079 --> 18:14.447
I'm glad it's over.

18:14.448 --> 18:15.781
If you hadn't come along,

18:15.782 --> 18:18.884
I never would
have stopped killing.

18:18.885 --> 18:21.786
But an eternity
in the Underworld,

18:21.787 --> 18:23.754
it's better
than living like this.

18:36.766 --> 18:38.800
Please. Please, ju--
Just be patient.

18:38.801 --> 18:41.436
Move.

18:41.437 --> 18:42.704
You know what I want.

18:42.705 --> 18:43.905
Yes. Of course, sir.

18:43.906 --> 18:45.774
Right away. I'll--
I'll just be a moment.

18:45.775 --> 18:47.442
We're running out
of Shadow Water.

18:47.443 --> 18:50.243
What? No, we're not.

18:55.114 --> 18:56.380
How did you--?

18:56.381 --> 18:58.082
Simple.
Added a little plain water,

18:58.083 --> 18:59.783
tripled our supply.
But--

18:59.784 --> 19:01.618
We were getting
four doses a jar.

19:01.619 --> 19:03.152
Now we're getting 12.

19:03.153 --> 19:04.821
What if the cure
doesn't work watered down?

19:04.822 --> 19:06.189
The banelings won't be happy.

19:06.190 --> 19:08.192
Of course it'll work.

19:10.663 --> 19:12.764
It's still glowing, isn't it?

19:14.133 --> 19:16.067
Get out there.

19:20.738 --> 19:23.006
You know who
I was before I died?

19:23.007 --> 19:24.173
No, sir.

19:24.174 --> 19:26.141
Captain of a D'Haran squadron.

19:26.142 --> 19:28.010
You don't make
a man like me wait.

19:28.011 --> 19:30.512
Time's too precious
when you work for the Keeper.

19:30.513 --> 19:31.846
We're terribly sorry, sir.

19:31.847 --> 19:32.881
Here you are.

19:41.155 --> 19:43.422
I'll tell my friends about this.

19:53.065 --> 19:54.498
Why are we stopping?

19:54.499 --> 19:57.901
We've been on the road less
than two hours.

19:57.902 --> 20:00.303
Even the Seeker needs
his sleep.

20:02.072 --> 20:04.406
You don't look well, Cara.

20:04.407 --> 20:05.941
You could do with
some rest too.

20:05.942 --> 20:07.175
I'm just hungry.

20:09.078 --> 20:10.178
I'm going hunting.

20:10.179 --> 20:11.712
Now?

20:11.713 --> 20:12.880
We've got some apples.

20:12.881 --> 20:14.848
I want meat.

20:14.849 --> 20:16.382
Okay,
I'll come with you.

20:16.383 --> 20:17.617
No.

20:17.618 --> 20:19.218
Zedd's right.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.686
You need some rest.

20:20.687 --> 20:24.956
Besides, I'm a better hunter
on my own anyway.

20:46.475 --> 20:49.010
Is somebody there?

20:54.548 --> 20:57.482
I don't have anything
for you tonight.

20:57.483 --> 21:00.485
Come back tomorrow,
and I might have a fresh supply.

21:00.486 --> 21:05.455
I can't wait till tomorrow.

21:16.433 --> 21:18.401
You deserve worse than this.

21:25.775 --> 21:27.843
<i>Every time you kill,</i>

21:27.844 --> 21:30.712
<i>the clock begins to tick again.</i>

21:54.195 --> 21:55.829
I was about
to come looking for you.

21:55.830 --> 21:58.665
It took me a while
to find some prey.

21:58.666 --> 22:00.033
Well, even without sleep,

22:00.034 --> 22:03.169
you look much
better this morning.

22:03.170 --> 22:04.903
I just needed a good meal.

22:10.942 --> 22:13.310
Hey. What are you doing?

22:13.311 --> 22:15.845
Closing up. We've only got
a few drops of the cure left.

22:15.846 --> 22:17.614
There's not enough
to keep watering it down.

22:17.615 --> 22:20.883
Then we'll mix plain water
with something else.

22:20.884 --> 22:23.752
Sorcerer's gypsum
will make it glow.

22:23.753 --> 22:26.121
But it won't cure anybody.

22:26.122 --> 22:28.823
Then we'll just tell 'em
it takes a few days to work.

22:28.824 --> 22:30.190
And when they realize?

22:30.191 --> 22:32.525
By the time anybody's the wiser,

22:32.526 --> 22:35.361
we'll be long gone,
with a fortune in our pockets.

22:35.362 --> 22:36.595
But it doesn't seem right.

22:36.596 --> 22:37.896
We'd be cheating people.

22:37.897 --> 22:40.165
Well, they're not people really.

22:40.166 --> 22:42.467
Banelings.

22:48.472 --> 22:50.774
You swindled me!

22:54.812 --> 22:58.414
You said I'd be cured, but after
half a day, the hunger was back.

22:58.415 --> 22:59.915
And look at my face!

22:59.916 --> 23:02.384
Sir, the dose we gave you
was watered down.

23:02.385 --> 23:04.686
But we have a few drops
of the pure liquid left.

23:04.687 --> 23:06.220
It will cure you permanently.

23:06.221 --> 23:07.722
You can have it.
No charge.

23:07.723 --> 23:09.690
I'll take my cure the old way.

23:09.691 --> 23:11.591
By sending your soul
to the Keeper.

23:14.194 --> 23:16.562
Let him go!

23:36.648 --> 23:38.849
Hello, Sebastian.

23:38.850 --> 23:40.050
Wizard!

23:40.051 --> 23:41.484
When I heard a magic peddler

23:41.485 --> 23:44.787
in South Caston was selling
a remedy for banelings,

23:44.788 --> 23:46.188
I knew it had to be you.

23:46.189 --> 23:48.023
And by the looks of them,

23:48.024 --> 23:49.358
I see I was also right

23:49.359 --> 23:51.726
that your so-called cure
is a sham.

23:51.727 --> 23:55.296
No. No, I assure you,
the cure is quite real.

23:56.765 --> 23:59.667
But it wasn't my idea.

24:01.469 --> 24:03.202
I was helping out a friend.

24:09.741 --> 24:11.775
Hello, brother.

24:26.015 --> 24:27.650
Lord Rahl.

24:27.651 --> 24:31.554
I'm puzzled I didn't see
you sooner, Eagan.

24:31.555 --> 24:33.590
Yesterday you failed
to deliver me a soul.

24:33.591 --> 24:35.024
You broke the covenant.

24:35.025 --> 24:36.659
And yet, somehow,

24:36.660 --> 24:39.528
you managed to remain among
the living.

24:39.529 --> 24:42.530
How, I wonder?

24:42.531 --> 24:43.631
I--

24:43.632 --> 24:46.768
I bought a cure.

24:46.769 --> 24:48.770
A cure?

24:48.771 --> 24:50.205
For being a baneling.

24:50.206 --> 24:52.606
They called it Shadow Water.

24:52.607 --> 24:53.974
But it didn't last.

24:53.975 --> 24:58.210
The secret of the source of
Shadow Water died decades ago,

24:58.211 --> 25:02.279
along with the Wizard
Carracticus Zorander.

25:02.280 --> 25:04.181
It didn't work anyway, my Lord.

25:04.182 --> 25:07.718
Oh, it worked.

25:07.719 --> 25:09.853
You're not the only baneling
who's stopped killing

25:09.854 --> 25:13.256
for the Keeper
in the past few days.

25:13.257 --> 25:15.058
But tell me.

25:15.059 --> 25:19.227
How is it that you
come to be dead again?

25:19.228 --> 25:21.163
The Seeker ran me through.

25:21.164 --> 25:24.498
The Seeker? Where?

25:24.499 --> 25:28.435
In the shop where they
were selling the cure.

25:28.436 --> 25:32.171
Then the Seeker knows
of its existence.

25:32.172 --> 25:36.408
Tell me, the Mord-Sith who's
with him, did she drink it?

25:36.409 --> 25:39.178
I don't think
they have any left.

25:39.179 --> 25:42.415
If not, then the Seeker will
be searching for the source.

25:42.416 --> 25:46.918
And he travels
with the son of Carracticus.

25:46.919 --> 25:48.787
They will find it.

25:48.788 --> 25:50.855
Send me back again, My Lord,
and I'll stop them.

25:52.657 --> 25:57.094
I'm afraid it's much too late
for you, Eagan.

26:03.335 --> 26:07.269
Now give me one good reason
I shouldn't incinerate you too.

26:07.270 --> 26:08.770
Who are you to question me?

26:08.771 --> 26:10.238
You said you were
going to come back

26:10.239 --> 26:12.206
after Darken Rahl was defeated,
but you didn't.

26:12.207 --> 26:14.441
Maybe you haven't heard, but
the Keeper of the Underworld

26:14.442 --> 26:16.475
is waging war
on the Land of the Living.

26:16.476 --> 26:18.976
I know all about it.
And I was trying to do my part,

26:18.977 --> 26:20.377
by curing banelings.

26:20.378 --> 26:22.646
Where did you find
this cure anyway?

26:22.647 --> 26:25.413
I was planting a new row
of squash in the back garden.

26:25.414 --> 26:26.547
My spade struck the crate.

26:26.548 --> 26:29.480
Father must have buried it there
a long time ago.

26:29.481 --> 26:32.183
Father.

26:32.184 --> 26:34.652
Was it Shadow Water?

26:34.653 --> 26:36.620
You knew about it?

26:36.621 --> 26:39.422
There was a rumor, when I was
training to be a Wizard,

26:39.423 --> 26:42.289
that Father had found the source
and was experimenting with it.

26:42.290 --> 26:45.190
Using it to bring the dead
back to life.

26:45.191 --> 26:47.958
But that kind of dark magic
is taboo for a Wizard.

26:47.959 --> 26:49.460
I was upset.

26:49.461 --> 26:51.495
I went to him,
he said it was a lie

26:51.496 --> 26:54.530
concocted by his enemies
to discredit him.

26:54.531 --> 26:56.031
And I believed him.

26:57.634 --> 27:00.101
Is there more?
Only a few drops.

27:00.102 --> 27:02.803
I don't know if there's
even enough to cure anyone.

27:02.804 --> 27:03.871
Can you make more?

27:03.872 --> 27:05.306
It can't be conjured.

27:05.307 --> 27:06.740
Only found.

27:10.977 --> 27:12.811
If I remember correctly...

27:14.347 --> 27:17.015
you have an apparatus

27:17.016 --> 27:20.217
that makes magical maps.

27:20.218 --> 27:22.686
I was making a map
a few months ago,

27:22.687 --> 27:23.853
and suddenly it jammed.

27:23.854 --> 27:26.389
It hasn't worked since.

27:28.392 --> 27:30.993
It's not broken, it's spelled.

27:30.994 --> 27:33.828
No doubt by
a dissatisfied customer.

27:33.829 --> 27:36.964
Harlan. I warned him
that map would take him

27:36.965 --> 27:38.499
through the Forest
of the Greel Mites.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.166
He blamed me for the rash.

27:40.167 --> 27:41.901
Spiteful old conjurer.

27:49.541 --> 27:50.708
Good as new.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.064
The source.

28:20.065 --> 28:21.632
We should be able
to get there

28:21.633 --> 28:22.833
in two days, maybe three.

28:22.834 --> 28:24.901
Three days?

28:24.902 --> 28:26.369
We got lucky.

28:26.370 --> 28:28.169
It could have been
a lot farther.

28:29.538 --> 28:30.738
I want to go with you.

28:30.739 --> 28:32.839
So you can bottle
the water and sell it?

28:32.840 --> 28:36.309
You're right, Zedd, I've been
selfish and short-sighted,

28:36.310 --> 28:38.711
but this cure could make
a big difference.

28:38.712 --> 28:40.479
You already have a quest.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.213
You don't have time
to pass out Shadow Water

28:42.214 --> 28:45.482
to banelings across
the Midlands. But I do.

28:45.483 --> 28:47.217
Please, brother.

28:47.218 --> 28:49.685
Give me a chance
to do something good

28:49.686 --> 28:53.122
and maybe the world will
remember both sons

28:53.123 --> 28:55.023
of the great
Carracticus Zorander.

29:26.781 --> 29:29.549
Having an early breakfast,
I see.

29:31.151 --> 29:32.318
What do you want?

29:32.319 --> 29:33.418
I'm hungry.

29:33.419 --> 29:35.720
We don't feed beggars.

29:35.721 --> 29:38.022
Your mother must have neglected
to teach you manners.

29:39.525 --> 29:42.326
Or maybe she didn't
have any herself.

29:42.327 --> 29:44.027
I'm going to enjoy killing you.

29:44.028 --> 29:47.530
Unfortunately for you...

29:50.600 --> 29:52.467
I'm already dead.

29:52.468 --> 29:54.268
She's a baneling!

30:13.621 --> 30:17.022
Now throw his body on that fire,
or I kill you too.

30:46.091 --> 30:48.593
How are you enjoying working
for me again?

30:48.594 --> 30:50.561
I serve Richard.

30:50.562 --> 30:53.497
What a hard-headed girl
you always were.

30:53.498 --> 30:56.133
But your first obligation
is to me now.

30:57.701 --> 31:01.170
And I believe you still owe me
a soul for today.

31:01.171 --> 31:02.438
I know the rules.

31:02.439 --> 31:04.273
Then why are you just
sitting here by the fire,

31:04.274 --> 31:06.642
when your time
is nearly running out?

31:08.846 --> 31:12.514
Don't tell me you've given up
on being a baneling already?

31:14.583 --> 31:18.285
It's harder than you thought
it would be, isn't it?

31:18.286 --> 31:21.521
You were lucky to find a nasty
D'Haran to kill last night,

31:21.522 --> 31:23.423
but...

31:23.424 --> 31:26.292
now, here you are,

31:26.293 --> 31:28.260
leagues from the nearest town

31:28.261 --> 31:30.562
with nobody to kill.

31:32.198 --> 31:34.365
Except them.

31:36.168 --> 31:38.802
Well, I knew this would happen.

31:38.803 --> 31:41.538
But I am prepared
to offer you a way out.

31:44.141 --> 31:47.910
Tell me where
the Shadow Water source is,

31:47.911 --> 31:50.145
and you will never have
to kill again.

31:51.814 --> 31:54.482
I don't have
to tell you anything.

31:54.483 --> 31:57.785
That's not part

31:57.786 --> 32:00.354
of our agreement.

32:02.256 --> 32:04.057
Very well.

32:04.058 --> 32:07.960
But you are going to
have to kill one of them.

32:07.961 --> 32:11.096
You really should give old
Thaddicus a thought.

32:11.097 --> 32:14.265
He hasn't amounted
to much in life.

32:14.266 --> 32:17.101
He never was any good to anyone.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.207
Thaddicus.

33:06.977 --> 33:09.845
Help me get some firewood.

33:09.846 --> 33:11.180
But it's not even light yet.

33:11.181 --> 33:12.781
It will be soon.

33:12.782 --> 33:14.616
And the others
will want breakfast.

33:21.390 --> 33:23.957
We're going
to get some more wood.

33:30.693 --> 33:33.961
That dried birch
will burn well.

33:43.135 --> 33:45.302
<i>He never was any good</i>
<i>to anyone.</i>

33:59.078 --> 34:01.479
<i>Give me a chance</i>
<i>to do something good.</i>

34:01.480 --> 34:03.948
<i>Maybe the world will remember</i>
<i>both sons</i>

34:03.949 --> 34:06.651
<i>of the great</i>
<i>Carracticus Zorander.</i>

34:08.487 --> 34:09.656
What's wrong?

34:17.969 --> 34:20.472
You-- Help! Zedd, help!

34:20.473 --> 34:21.639
Help!

34:21.639 --> 34:23.574
I'm not going to hurt you.

34:23.574 --> 34:25.876
What happened?
She's a baneling!

34:33.416 --> 34:35.449
Cara.

34:35.451 --> 34:37.150
When?

34:37.152 --> 34:40.353
Three days ago.

34:40.355 --> 34:41.655
I've already killed twice.

34:43.123 --> 34:46.092
You died in the fight
with that driver.

34:46.092 --> 34:47.326
Rahl offered you the deal.

34:47.327 --> 34:50.094
I asked him
to make me a baneling.

34:50.096 --> 34:51.196
Why?

34:53.165 --> 34:54.831
I had to get back,

34:54.833 --> 34:59.202
to tell you where the kidnappers
had taken the captives.

35:03.606 --> 35:05.937
And I had to protect you.

35:05.938 --> 35:08.606
You, Richard.

35:11.111 --> 35:12.978
But I'm no use to you like this.

35:12.979 --> 35:16.882
I almost killed Thaddicus.

35:16.883 --> 35:19.351
I was looking at the map.

35:19.352 --> 35:21.019
There's a faster way
to the source,

35:21.020 --> 35:22.955
a canyon pass.

35:22.956 --> 35:24.522
We'll get you the Shadow Water.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.155
Even if it was only
a thousand paces,

35:26.156 --> 35:27.556
I won't make it.

35:30.293 --> 35:32.193
Please, go.

35:32.194 --> 35:34.095
I don't want you
to see me like this.

35:37.699 --> 35:39.467
Is there anything you can do?

35:41.069 --> 35:44.036
Banelings are created
with dark magic.

35:46.773 --> 35:49.775
I have no power to help you.

35:49.776 --> 35:50.975
I'm sorry.

35:58.583 --> 36:01.284
May the Creator watch over you.

36:13.594 --> 36:15.494
Thank you.

36:15.495 --> 36:18.329
For what?

36:18.330 --> 36:20.031
You could have killed me
to save yourself.

36:20.032 --> 36:22.333
But you didn't.

36:26.571 --> 36:29.672
Thaddicus!
No.

36:29.673 --> 36:31.474
Thaddicus, why?

36:36.578 --> 36:38.078
Give him the Breath of Life!

36:38.079 --> 36:41.081
I lost that power
when I became a baneling.

36:41.082 --> 36:43.450
If you drank from the source,
you'd get that power back. Zedd?

36:43.451 --> 36:45.052
It stands to reason.

36:45.053 --> 36:46.286
Cara and I will run.

36:46.287 --> 36:50.223
You follow with Thaddicus
as fast as you can.

36:50.224 --> 36:53.654
Welcome to your eternal reward,

36:53.655 --> 36:55.456
Thaddicus.

36:56.758 --> 36:58.658
I'll take the deal.

36:58.659 --> 37:01.793
Make me a baneling.

37:01.794 --> 37:04.395
So that you can find
the Shadow Water,

37:04.396 --> 37:07.098
cure yourself, and cheat me?

37:07.099 --> 37:08.733
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:08.734 --> 37:11.068
You think I don't know you've
been traveling with the Seeker

37:11.069 --> 37:12.636
searching for the source?

37:14.538 --> 37:16.971
Tell me where is it, Thaddicus.

37:19.073 --> 37:20.373
I don't know.

37:20.374 --> 37:23.977
Oh, but I think you do.

37:23.978 --> 37:27.949
And I think you will tell me.

37:35.724 --> 37:39.728
Come on. It should be on
the other side of this ridge.

37:43.299 --> 37:47.369
Tell me where the source is
before I do my worst.

37:49.840 --> 37:51.173
In a grove.

37:51.174 --> 37:52.741
In the Valley of Echoes!

37:52.742 --> 37:54.475
May the Creator forgive me!

38:00.181 --> 38:02.214
Oh, I'm afraid the Creator

38:02.215 --> 38:06.148
can't do you any good here,
Thaddicus.

38:18.558 --> 38:19.925
There it is.

38:26.965 --> 38:29.033
No!

38:57.655 --> 38:59.572
I've got some.

39:12.267 --> 39:14.584
I don't know how much longer
we can drag him.

39:14.585 --> 39:16.168
He's growing colder.

39:16.169 --> 39:17.561
If too much time passes,

39:17.562 --> 39:19.578
the Breath of Life won't work.

39:19.579 --> 39:21.528
I'm here!

39:43.711 --> 39:45.102
Thank the Spirits.

39:46.395 --> 39:47.943
How?

39:47.944 --> 39:51.286
You saved Cara's life,
so she returned the favor.

39:54.230 --> 39:55.545
You should
have let me stay dead.

39:55.546 --> 39:57.037
What are you talking about?

39:57.038 --> 39:59.289
I told Darken Rahl the location
of the source.

40:00.840 --> 40:01.831
I was too weak.

40:01.832 --> 40:04.840
I couldn't stand the pain.

40:04.841 --> 40:07.850
Few could withstand the torments
of the Underworld, Thaddicus.

40:07.851 --> 40:11.127
But even fewer would sacrifice
their life for another.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.627
Why did you?

40:16.020 --> 40:17.836
I nearly killed you.

40:17.837 --> 40:19.262
But you didn't.

40:19.263 --> 40:22.004
And when I saw you dying
I realized

40:22.005 --> 40:24.679
I'm just an old man.

40:24.680 --> 40:26.996
I've never done anything
for anyone but myself.

40:26.997 --> 40:28.980
But you're important.

40:28.981 --> 40:32.847
You help people. You--
You protect the Seeker.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.817
Your life is much more valuable
than mine.

40:39.328 --> 40:40.820
Thaddicus,

40:40.821 --> 40:43.731
your life is valuable
to me, brother.

40:50.777 --> 40:52.828
I'm grateful

40:52.829 --> 40:56.897
to both of you
for helping me save Thaddicus.

40:56.898 --> 40:59.148
It wasn't just Thaddicus
we wanted to save.

41:03.475 --> 41:04.898
Still.

41:04.899 --> 41:07.640
You must think I'm a monster.

41:07.641 --> 41:09.457
For taking the deal.

41:09.458 --> 41:12.399
If I was faced
with the same choice--

41:12.400 --> 41:14.683
Eternity in the Underworld

41:14.684 --> 41:17.758
or come back, help Richard,

41:17.759 --> 41:18.984
be with him.

41:20.902 --> 41:23.309
--I might have made
the same decision.

41:31.681 --> 41:33.664
I guess this
is where we part company.

41:33.665 --> 41:36.541
After we've found the Stone
of Tears, I'll come see you.

41:36.542 --> 41:37.835
I promise.

41:48.982 --> 41:50.030
Thank you.

42:00.681 --> 42:03.029
I wonder what he'll do now.

42:03.030 --> 42:05.704
Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.

42:05.705 --> 42:09.015
and purchase a jar
of genuine soil

42:09.016 --> 42:10.833
from the hallowed
and enchanted ground

42:10.834 --> 42:14.740
that once bordered the renowned
source of Shadow Water.

42:14.741 --> 42:17.299
This unrivaled and efficacious
loam has been known

42:17.300 --> 42:21.415
to cure boils and warts,
snuff out colds,

42:21.416 --> 42:24.507
and, yes,
it will even re-grow hair.

42:24.508 --> 42:26.429
You, sir,
for a mere five shillings,

42:26.430 --> 42:28.516
can reclaim the flowing locks
of your youth.

42:28.517 --> 42:30.186
Allow me to demonstrate.

42:30.187 --> 42:31.222
Oh.

42:32.257 --> 42:33.491
Just give it a couple of days.

42:33.492 --> 42:35.993
You'll be astounded
by the results.
