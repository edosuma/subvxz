SHE'LL DESTROY ME.

07:01.067 --> 07:01.933

07:59.900 --> 08:00.933
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE
NOT GONNA PAUSE IT ?

08:00.967 --> 08:03.167
I'M NOT A PAUSER,
I DON'T LIKE PAUSING.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.900
WELL, THAT'S NOT
BEING VERY FAIR.

08:04.933 --> 08:06.100
FINE !

08:08.633 --> 08:09.933
HURRY UP !

08:24.167 --> 08:25.067
READY ?

08:25.067 --> 08:26.700
YEAH, THAT'S
MORE LIKE IT.

08:29.833 --> 08:30.700
HAVE YOU SEEN OSCAR ?

08:30.733 --> 08:31.967
NO.

08:32.067 --> 08:35.733
OSCAR ?!

08:35.767 --> 08:39.767
DID YOU LEAVE
THE DOOR OPEN ?

08:39.800 --> 08:41.267
YEAH, WHEN...

08:41.300 --> 08:43.300
GODDAMNIT.

08:43.333 --> 08:44.967

SEE THAT ?

09:05.833 --> 09:07.133
WHAT ?

09:07.167 --> 09:09.633
I WAVED TO A GUY IN A PRIUS
AND HE DIDN'T WAVE BACK.

09:09.667 --> 09:10.767
I DON'T WAVE TO PEOPLE
IN THE SAME CAR AS ME.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.767
WELL, WE'RE PRIUS DRIVERS,
WE'RE A SPECIAL BREED.

09:13.800 --> 09:14.967
A SPECIAL BREED.

09:15.067 --> 09:15.967
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

09:16.067 --> 09:17.367
I WANNA SEE WHAT'S UP
WITH THAT GUY.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.633
SEE WHAT'S UP
WITH THAT GUY ?

09:18.667 --> 09:21.700
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

09:21.733 --> 09:24.867
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
AFTER YOU CATCH HIM ?

09:24.900 --> 09:26.500
NOTHIN'.

09:26.533 --> 09:27.733
OH, MY GOD !

09:27.767 --> 09:28.967

09:29.067 --> 09:29.700
OSCAR.

09:29.733 --> 09:31.867
( dog whimpering )

09:34.167 --> 09:36.067
OSCAR !

09:36.100 --> 09:38.767
OH, MY GOD,
ARE YOU OKAY ?

09:38.800 --> 09:39.400
OSCY !

09:39.433 --> 09:40.167
HE SEEMS OKAY.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.767
OSCY, ARE YOU OKAY, BOY ?

09:41.800 --> 09:43.833
HE'S NOT BLEEDING
OR ANYTHING.

09:43.867 --> 09:45.067
LET ME SEE
IF HE CAN STAND.

09:45.100 --> 09:47.333
COME ON,
STAND UP, OSCY.

09:47.367 --> 09:49.867
OH YEAH,
HE SEEMS FINE.

09:49.900 --> 09:51.200
OH.

09:51.233 --> 09:52.233
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO ?

09:52.267 --> 09:53.967
SHOULD WE, SHOULD
WE TAKE HIM TO THE VET ?

09:54.067 --> 09:55.767
HE SEEMS OKAY.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.200
HE ACTUALLY
DOES SEEM OKAY.

09:58.233 --> 10:01.700
ALRIGHT, WE'LL GO
BACK TO THE HOUSE.

10:01.733 --> 10:02.933
WE'LL PUT THE VIDEO IN,

10:02.967 --> 10:05.800
WATCH IT AND THE WHOLE TIME
WE'LL MONITOR OSCAR.

10:05.833 --> 10:09.400
YEAH, WE'LL WATCH,
WE'LL WATCH THE VIDEO

10:09.433 --> 10:11.300
AND WE'LL KEEP AN EYE
ON HIM AT THE SAME TIME.

10:11.333 --> 10:13.300
I'M NOT SAYING DON'T TAKE HIM
TO THE VET, BUT IF HE NEEDS TO.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.800
YEAH, RIGHT, WE'LL WATCH
THE VIDEO AND MONITOR HIM.

10:15.833 --> 10:18.000
VIDEO AND MONITOR,
THAT'S IT.

10:18.033 --> 10:19.533
ALRIGHT, LET'S GET HIM
IN THE CAR, COME ON.

10:19.567 --> 10:22.400
HEY, DO NOT TELL ANYONE
ABOUT THIS, ANYONE.

10:22.433 --> 10:24.033
YEAH, WELL,
HE KNOWS ABOUT IT.

10:24.067 --> 10:26.200
GOOD THING
HE CAN'T TALK.

10:26.233 --> 10:27.067
COME ON PAL, HOP IN.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.133
HE SEEMS OKAY.

10:28.167 --> 10:29.067
HE SEEMS FINE.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.600
HUH, IS IT
MY IMAGINATION ?

10:30.633 --> 10:31.667
NO, HE SEEMS FINE.

10:31.700 --> 10:32.767
I THINK
HE SEEMS OKAY.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.000
YEAH.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.267
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.700
I DON'T EVEN
THINK I HIT HIM.

10:36.733 --> 10:38.200
I DON'T THINK
YOU HIT HIM EITHER.

10:38.233 --> 10:39.333
I DID NOT
HIT THAT DOG.

10:39.367 --> 10:40.300
YOU DID NOT
HIT THAT DOG.

10:40.333 --> 10:41.767
HEY, LET'S MAKE
A PACT RIGHT NOW.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.800
IF WE NOTICE ANYTHING WRONG
WHILE WE'RE WATCHING THIS TAPE,

10:43.833 --> 10:45.900
WE'RE GONNA STOP THE TAPE
AND TAKE HIM TO THE VET.

10:45.933 --> 10:47.100
IMMEDIATELY.
IMMEDIATELY.

10:47.133 --> 10:49.533
LET'S GO.

10:56.033 --> 10:59.133
SEE IT PAYS TO LAY OFF
THAT SEX FOR AWHILE.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.500
YOU KNOW, IT KIND
OF REMINDS ME OF

11:02.533 --> 11:05.700
WHEN MANTLE WAS
INJURED IN '63.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.100
HE WAS OUT FOR
ABOUT TWO MONTHS.

11:07.133 --> 11:10.167
COMES BACK,
FIRST AT BAT,

11:10.200 --> 11:12.367
OUT OF THE PARK,
HOME RUN,

11:12.400 --> 11:14.600
HUH, IT'S KIND
OF SIMILAR.

11:17.567 --> 11:18.600
WHAT ?

11:18.633 --> 11:25.067
THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY
STRANGE HAPPENING.

11:25.067 --> 11:28.533
I AM COMPLETELY NUMB.

11:28.567 --> 11:29.733
YEAH.

11:29.767 --> 11:30.967
YEAH.DOWN T?

11:31.067 --> 11:33.067
I CAN'T
FEEL ANYTHING.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.867
YEAH.
REALLY ?

11:35.900 --> 11:37.067
HMM.

11:37.067 --> 11:40.167
I DON'T KNOW WHY, THIS HAS
NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

11:40.200 --> 11:45.367
WELL, IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE CONDOM ?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.533
I DON'T KNOW
WHY IT WOULD.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.600
EVERLAST.

11:50.633 --> 11:52.600
LAST ALL NIGHT.

11:52.633 --> 11:57.500
CONTAINS
THE NUMBING AGENT...

11:57.533 --> 11:59.567
LIDOCAINE.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.400
WHAT ?

12:06.433 --> 12:09.400
I MUST HAVE PUT IT
ON INSIDE OUT.

12:09.433 --> 12:10.533
INSIDE OUT ?

12:10.567 --> 12:12.767
HONESTLY, YOU DON'T
KNOW HOW TO PUT THIS ON ?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.633
I JUST, I DON'T KNOW,
NO, I PUT IT ON,

12:14.667 --> 12:15.733
I SLIPPED IT ON THE WAY YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO PUT IT ON--

12:15.767 --> 12:17.500
15-YEAR-OLD BOYS
DO IT EVERYDAY.

12:17.533 --> 12:18.500
IT'S NOT HARD !

12:18.533 --> 12:20.200
WELL, I DON'T
USE IT THAT OFTEN.

12:20.233 --> 12:21.500
I JUST SLIPPED IT ON
THE WAY I--

12:21.533 --> 12:22.733
THERE'S NO INSTRUCTIONS
OR ANYTHING.

12:22.767 --> 12:23.833
I ROLLED IT DOWN.

12:23.867 --> 12:26.333
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S
A WRONG WAY AND A RIGHT WAY.

12:26.367 --> 12:28.833
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTED
TO WEAR THE CONDOM.

12:28.867 --> 12:30.900
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
KNOW HOW TO PUT IT ON, LARRY.

12:30.933 --> 12:32.133
JESUS.

12:32.167 --> 12:34.367
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD
PUT IT ON INSIDE OUT.

12:34.400 --> 12:38.600
( phone ringing )

12:38.633 --> 12:39.233
HELLO ?

12:39.267 --> 12:40.333
HEY.

12:40.367 --> 12:42.233
Hey, that condom
you gave me, Everlast ?

12:42.267 --> 12:43.233
YEAH.

12:43.267 --> 12:44.633
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THAT THING.

12:44.667 --> 12:45.533
WHAT ?

12:45.567 --> 12:47.067
I put it inside out
by mistake,

12:47.067 --> 12:49.233
NOW CHERYL'S ALL NUMB
IN HER VAGINA.

12:49.267 --> 12:50.567
DON'T YOU KNOW HOW
TO PUT A RUBBER ON ?

12:50.600 --> 12:52.067
IT'S DARK IN THE ROOM,
WHO CAN READ ?

12:52.067 --> 12:54.567
I CAN'T START LOOKING
AT THE PACKAGE AND
READING INSTRUCTIONS.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.967
HOW COULD YOU
HAVE DONE THAT ?

12:56.067 --> 12:58.067
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT.

12:58.067 --> 13:01.500
I COULDN'T, IT WAS REALLY LIKE
SQUEEZING THE LIFE OUT OF ME.

13:01.533 --> 13:03.367
THEY'RE DESIGNED
TO GO THE OTHER WAY AND,

13:03.400 --> 13:05.067
AND THEN YOU LAST
AND YOU LAST.

13:05.067 --> 13:06.467
HAVE YOU EVER
HEARD OF THIS BEFORE ?

13:06.500 --> 13:07.300
What ?

13:07.333 --> 13:08.467
THE NUMB VAGINA ?

13:08.500 --> 13:10.400
WE GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS
THAN A NUMB VAGINA.

13:10.433 --> 13:11.067
What ?

13:11.067 --> 13:13.167
OSCAR IS NOT GOOD.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.833
HE'S JUST
LETHARGIC AS CAN BE

13:15.867 --> 13:19.500
AND HIS, HIS BARK
IS LIKE...

13:19.533 --> 13:20.533
MASCULATED.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.900
YOU THINK IT'S
FROM THE INCIDENT ?

13:21.933 --> 13:23.400
YES, I THINK IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE INCIDENT.

13:23.433 --> 13:24.600
( Susie )
JEFFREY !

13:24.633 --> 13:26.967
SUSIE KNOWS SOMETHING'S
GOING DOWN, I'M TELLING YOU.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.600
JEFFREY, WHERE
THE HELL ARE YOU ?

13:28.633 --> 13:29.900
WELL, YOU LISTEN
AND YOU LISTEN GOOD.

13:29.933 --> 13:31.167
YOU KEEP
THAT TRAP SHUT.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.067
You read me.

13:32.067 --> 13:33.067
WHAT DID YOU
DO TO THIS DOG ?!

13:33.067 --> 13:34.333
THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH OSCAR !

13:34.367 --> 13:35.867
ALRIGHT LISTEN, SUSIE'S YELLING,
I GOTTA GET GOING ALRIGHT.

13:35.900 --> 13:37.533
I'M SORRY ABOUT
CHERYL'S VAGINA.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.400
JEFFREY, WHAT'S
WRONG WITH HIM ?
I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER, BYE.

13:45.800 --> 13:49.667
HEY !

13:49.700 --> 13:51.067
HOW IS IT ?

13:51.100 --> 13:54.600
IT FEELS LIKE IT'S BEEN
SHOT WITH NOVOCAINE.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.233
OH MY GOD.
NOTHING.

13:56.267 --> 13:59.333
I'M REALLY SORRY.

14:02.067 --> 14:05.733
HEY, WANDERING BEAR...

14:05.767 --> 14:06.867
HOW'S IT GOING ?

14:06.900 --> 14:08.567
( speaking foreign language )
... GOOD.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.767
( imitates foreign language )
... OKAY.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.833
HEY, I'M SORRY ABOUT
THAT SITUATION WITH, UH,

14:12.867 --> 14:15.533
JEFF AND SUSIE.

14:15.567 --> 14:19.167
YOU SHOULD JUST GO THERE
AND DEMAND THAT THEY PAY YOU

14:19.200 --> 14:20.067
THE MONEY
THEY OWE YOU.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.733
I GUARANTEE
YOU'LL GET IT.

14:23.767 --> 14:28.533
THERE'S AN OLD INDIAN SAYING,
"WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND."

14:28.567 --> 14:30.900
YOU SURE
THAT'S INDIAN ?

14:30.933 --> 14:32.933
I THOUGHT
THAT WAS ENGLISH.

14:32.967 --> 14:36.600
IT COULD
APPLY TO ANYONE.

14:36.633 --> 14:40.133
HEY, WANDERING BEAR,
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

14:40.167 --> 14:42.967
YOU'RE A SHAMAN
OF SORTS.

14:43.067 --> 14:46.567
YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT
PLANTS AND HERBS

14:46.600 --> 14:48.600
AND YOU'RE KIND OF
A MEDICINE MAN IN A WAY.

14:48.633 --> 14:51.233
LAST NIGHT...

14:51.267 --> 14:54.733
I PUT A CONDOM ON
INSIDE OUT.

14:54.767 --> 14:58.100
AND MY WIFE'S VAGINA
IS COMPLETELY NUMB.

14:58.133 --> 15:01.067
DO YOU KNOW OF ANY...

15:01.067 --> 15:04.933
HERBAL REMEDY THAT
MIGHT WORK FOR HER ?

15:04.967 --> 15:07.567
( sighing )

15:07.600 --> 15:11.167
( drums playing )

15:11.200 --> 15:15.633
HMM...

15:15.667 --> 15:18.067
GIVE ME A PENCIL
AND PAPER.

15:18.067 --> 15:21.867
WELL, I HAVE A PEN.

15:21.900 --> 15:23.900
SAME THING.

15:23.933 --> 15:27.333
WELL, YEAH,
BUT YOU SAID PENCIL,

15:27.367 --> 15:31.900
SO I JUST THOUGHT I'D
MENTION THAT I HAD A PEN.

15:31.933 --> 15:35.367
THEY BOTH PERFORM
THE SAME FUNCTION.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.400
THAT'S TRUE.

15:37.433 --> 15:39.067
PENCIL HAS
AN ERASER.

15:39.067 --> 15:40.833
YOU MAKE A MISTAKE
YOU CAN ERASE.

15:40.867 --> 15:42.267
SO THERE'S
A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE.

15:42.300 --> 15:45.500
SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY
SPECIFIC ABOUT IT.

15:45.533 --> 15:47.533
ONE WRITES,
THE OTHER WRITES.

15:47.567 --> 15:50.167
BUT YOU DID
SAY PENCIL.

16:10.233 --> 16:13.433
IS THAT A "Y" ?

16:13.467 --> 16:16.067
THAT'S A "T".

16:16.100 --> 16:18.767
THANK YOU,
WANDERING BEAR.

16:23.967 --> 16:26.600
( whistling )

16:26.633 --> 16:28.267
WHAT ?

16:42.667 --> 16:44.467
HEY.HEY.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.733
YOU FORGOT TO CANCEL
THAT LUNCH WITH JASON SMALL.

16:47.767 --> 16:50.167
OH, OH YEAH.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.467
YEAH, HE CALLED MY HOUSE,
IT WAS KIND OF EMBARRASSING.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.833
REALLY ?
WOW.

16:54.867 --> 16:57.300
OH, GOSH I'M REALLY
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

16:57.333 --> 17:00.067
UM, TODAY I NEED YOU
TO GO TO MEL BROOKS' OFFICE

17:00.100 --> 17:02.333
AND PICK UP SOME
MUSIC FOR ME.

17:02.367 --> 17:04.667
AND THEN I NEED YOU TO GO
TO MY BUSINESS MANAGER'S OFFICE

17:04.700 --> 17:07.100
AND THERE'S A PACKAGE WHICH I
NEED YOU TO BRING TO MY HOUSE.

17:07.133 --> 17:10.433
UH, HEY, LET ME ASK YOU,
UM, LIKE A GUY QUESTION.

17:10.467 --> 17:11.767
SURE.

17:11.800 --> 17:15.067
UH, AT HOME MY MACHINE IS
FULL OF ALL THESE HANGUPS.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.233
YEAH.

17:16.267 --> 17:18.400
AND I'M WONDERING IF
IT'S MARVIN CALLING ME

17:18.433 --> 17:19.367
BECAUSE HE WANTS
TO TALK TO ME.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.800
YEAH, OF COURSE,
OF COURSE, MARVIN'S...

17:20.833 --> 17:21.667
IS IT ?
YES, YES.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.067
YEAH.OKAY, AL.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.533
( phone ringing )
SO I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

17:24.567 --> 17:27.133
I MEAN CLEARLY
HE'S REACHING OUT,

17:27.167 --> 17:33.500
BUT I SHOULDN'T MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE, RIGHT ?

17:33.533 --> 17:34.767
YEAH, YOU WANT
TO GET THE PHONE ?

17:34.800 --> 17:36.067
SHOULD IAKE THE FIRST,
I MEAN...

17:36.067 --> 17:36.967
NO.

17:37.067 --> 17:38.533
NO, I SHOULD
STAND MY GROUND, RIGHT ?

17:38.567 --> 17:40.100
MMM-HMM.

17:40.133 --> 17:41.567
OKAY, THANKS, LARRY.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.200
HELLO ?

17:43.233 --> 17:44.467
( dial tone )
LARRY DAVID,
HELLO ?

17:49.067 --> 17:52.267
WANDERING BEAR
CURED HER VAGINA.

17:52.300 --> 17:53.767
HE WROTE
DOWN THIS THING.

17:53.800 --> 17:54.933
IT'S A ROOT
OR SOMETHING.

17:54.967 --> 17:56.067
SHE WENT TO A HEALTH
FOOD STORE.

17:56.100 --> 17:59.300
I SPOKE TO HER
ON THE PHONE...

17:59.333 --> 18:00.200
SHE'S BACK.

18:00.233 --> 18:02.367
WANDERING BEAR
CURES VAGINAS ?

18:02.400 --> 18:04.567
THAT GUY IS SOME KIND
OF MAGICIAN OR SOMETHING.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.067
I WISH I HAD SPECIAL POWERS
OVER THE VAGINA.

18:07.067 --> 18:08.733
HOW'S, UH, HOW'S
OSCAR BY THE WAY ?

18:08.767 --> 18:09.967
NOT GOOD.

18:10.067 --> 18:13.433
HE'S, UH, JUST MOPING
AROUND, SAME OLD THING.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.067
MAKING THOSE NOISES.

18:14.067 --> 18:14.767
YEAH.RE?

18:14.800 --> 18:16.867
SUSIE TOOK HIM
TO THE VET.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.767
DID YOU SAY
ANYTHING ?

18:20.067 --> 18:21.433
OKAY.

18:21.467 --> 18:25.733
OH, HEY BY THE WAY, HERE,
YOU CAN HAVE THESE CONDOMS BACK.

18:25.767 --> 18:26.900
NO, I'M NOT
USING THEM ANYMORE.

18:26.933 --> 18:28.433
MY DOCTOR
TOLD ME NOT TO.

18:28.467 --> 18:31.067
HE SAYS IT'S NO GOOD FOR ME
TO KEEP GOING AND GOING.

18:31.067 --> 18:33.633
IT'S NOT GOOD
FOR MY HEART.

18:33.667 --> 18:34.700
WOW.

18:34.733 --> 18:36.267
IT'S A RUBBER
FOR A YOUNG MAN.

18:36.300 --> 18:37.400
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

18:37.433 --> 18:38.400
YOU MIGHT BE
RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

18:38.433 --> 18:39.667
OKAY, THAT'S
WHAT IT'S FOR.

18:39.700 --> 18:42.367
HEY, MY FIVE WOOD'S
COMING IN TODAY AT 4:30.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.533
LET'S GO GET IT.

18:44.567 --> 18:45.733
BEAUTIFUL.
ALRIGHT, I'LL PICK
YOU UP AT 4:30.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.333
HEY.

18:58.367 --> 18:59.800
HI.
HI.

18:59.833 --> 19:01.667
WHAT DID
THE VET SAY ?

19:01.700 --> 19:04.600
HE SAID THAT OSCAR'S
VOICE BOX IS DAMAGED

19:04.633 --> 19:07.100
AS THOUGH SOMEBODY WAS
TRYING TO STRANGLE HIM.

19:07.133 --> 19:08.467
STRANGLE THE DOG ?

19:08.500 --> 19:09.833
YEAH, SOMEBODY WAS
TRYING TO CHOKE HIM.

19:09.867 --> 19:12.233
WHO COULD THAT BE
I WONDER ?

19:12.267 --> 19:15.067
WHAT, WHO WOULD WANT TO DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

19:15.067 --> 19:16.400
THE DOG BIT
YOUR PENIS

19:16.433 --> 19:17.767
SO YOU'RE TRYING
TO FUCKING KILL HIM ?

19:17.800 --> 19:18.733
IS THAT
WHAT IT IS ?

19:18.767 --> 19:20.333
OH REALLY ?
NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.667
THEN WHAT HAPPENED ?
YEAH.

19:21.700 --> 19:23.600
HOW COME HE CAN'T SPEAK,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM ?

19:23.633 --> 19:25.233
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
HE GOT HIT BY A CAR.

19:25.267 --> 19:27.967
OH, PLEASE, HE'S GONNA
GET HIT BY A CAR, HOW ?

19:28.067 --> 19:29.900
WELL, MAYBE SOMEBODY
LEFT THE DOOR OPEN.

19:29.933 --> 19:32.400
WHO'S GONNA LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN
AND LET HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE ?

19:32.433 --> 19:33.967
JEFF COULD HAVE
LEFT THE DOOR OPEN.

19:34.067 --> 19:36.700
JEFF, DID YOU
LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN ?

19:36.733 --> 19:37.767
YEAH, EXACTLY.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.133
I'M NOT SAYING
HE DID IT ON PURPOSE.

19:39.167 --> 19:40.467
MAYBE HE WENT TO GET
SOMETHING FROM HIS CAR.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.400
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

19:41.433 --> 19:43.500
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T
TRY TO STRANGLE HIM,

19:43.533 --> 19:46.067
BUT SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED
AND YOU WERE INVOLVED

19:46.100 --> 19:49.400
AND I AM GONNA GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS !

19:58.700 --> 20:00.067
HI, WANDERING BEAR.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.733
HELLO.

20:01.767 --> 20:04.033
HOW IS YOUR VAGINA ?

20:07.833 --> 20:09.567
IT'S...

20:09.600 --> 20:11.267
GETTING BETTER.

20:11.300 --> 20:14.100
GOOD.

20:24.467 --> 20:28.400
WANDERING BEAR JUST
ASKED ME HOW MY VAGINA IS.

20:28.433 --> 20:31.733
WELL, I'M SURE HE JUST WANTED
TO SEE IF HIS CURE WAS WORKING.

20:31.767 --> 20:33.300
OKAY, WELL I DON'T
APPRECIATE STRANGERS

20:33.333 --> 20:35.700
ASKING ME ABOUT
MY VAGINA, GOD.

20:35.733 --> 20:37.533
WAIT A SECOND.

20:37.567 --> 20:39.033
DID YOU THANK HIM ?

20:39.067 --> 20:40.467
NO.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.833
WELL, YOU COULD HAVE LEAST
EXPRESSED SOME GRATITUDE.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.367
HE DID CURE YOUR VAGINA,
DID HE NOT ?

20:50.300 --> 20:54.967
HEY, WANDERING BEAR...

20:55.000 --> 20:57.400
MIGHT NOT BE
SUCH A GOOD IDEA

20:57.433 --> 21:00.633
TO ASK MY WIFE
HOW HER VAGINA IS.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.767
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS
WITH AMERICAN INDIANS,

21:02.800 --> 21:05.733
BUT THE JEW GENERALLY
DOESN'T ASK OTHER MEN'S WIVES

21:05.767 --> 21:07.100
ABOUT THEIR VAGINA.

21:07.133 --> 21:10.267
IT'S A CUSTOM.

21:10.300 --> 21:14.533
WELL, IF YOU TAKE HER
TO THE WHITE MAN DOCTOR,

21:14.567 --> 21:18.867
HE WILL NOT ONLY ASK ABOUT
HER VAGINA, HE'LL LOOK.

21:18.900 --> 21:22.467
GOOD POINT,
WANDERING BEAR,
GOOD POINT.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.967
ANYWAY, IT'S REALLY
WORKING OUT.

21:24.067 --> 21:25.600
SHE'S FEELING
A LOT BETTER.

21:25.633 --> 21:27.167
THANKS AGAIN.

21:33.200 --> 21:39.800
HEY, HERE ARE THE PAPERS FROM
YOUR BUSINESS MANAGER'S OFFICE.

21:39.833 --> 21:43.700
WHAT ABOUT THE MUSIC
FROM MEL'S OFFICE ?

21:43.733 --> 21:48.400
OH, LARRY, WAS I SUPPOSED
TO PICK THAT UP ?

21:48.433 --> 21:49.933
YEAH.

21:49.967 --> 21:51.533
I'M SORRY,
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

21:51.567 --> 21:54.333
UH-HUH, JUST LIKE YOU
FORGOT TO CALL JASON SMALL

21:54.367 --> 21:57.367
AND CANCEL
THE LUNCH APPOINTMENT.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.400
OKAY, FINE,
I'M SORRY,

21:59.433 --> 22:01.600
I'M TERRIBLE,
I'M A BAD ASSISTANT.

22:01.633 --> 22:03.233
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T NEED THIS.

22:03.267 --> 22:05.067
DO YOUR OWN ERRANDS,
RUN YOUR OWN LIFE.

22:05.100 --> 22:05.933
I'M DONE, I QUIT,
NO, I QUIT, LARRY...

22:05.967 --> 22:06.833
WHAT ?

22:06.867 --> 22:07.933
I QUIT, I DON'T
NEED THIS ANYMORE.

22:07.967 --> 22:10.367
WHAT, YOU QUIT ?
NO, YOU CAN'T QUIT.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.267
YOU CAN TELL JASON SMALL,
UH, OR MAYBE I WILL,

22:13.300 --> 22:14.933
ABOUT YOUR MOM'S
FAKE UNVEILING.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.333
HOW ABOUT THAT,
ISN'T THAT NICE ?

22:16.367 --> 22:18.600
AND I'M SURE CHERYL
WOULD LOVE TO HEAR

22:18.633 --> 22:21.067
ABOUT "COLLEGE GIRLS
GONE WILD".

22:21.100 --> 22:23.300
YEAH, CHERYL, THAT'S RIGHT,
"COLLEGE GIRLS GONE WILD".

22:23.333 --> 22:24.800
CHERYL, IT'S HOT !

22:24.833 --> 22:27.767
YOU KNOW WHAT, EVERYBODY'S GONNA
KNOW EVERY LIE, EVERY DECEIT,

22:27.800 --> 22:29.967
EVERY HALF TRUTH
YOU HAVE EVER TOLD, MISTER !

22:30.067 --> 22:30.767
WHAT ?

22:30.800 --> 22:32.233
EIGHT YEARS
OF SERVICE !

22:32.267 --> 22:35.700
COME ON, ALRIGHT,
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,

22:35.733 --> 22:36.967
I'M SORRY,
I APOLOGIZE.

22:37.067 --> 22:38.067
BUT YOU CAN'T QUIT.

22:38.067 --> 22:40.667
COME ON, I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY !

22:40.700 --> 22:43.367
LARRY ?

22:43.400 --> 22:44.333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

22:44.367 --> 22:47.067
SHE QUIT, SHE QUIT.

22:47.067 --> 22:48.400
SHE'S GONNA EXPOSE ME
TO THE WORLD.

22:48.433 --> 22:49.900
SHE SAID SHE WAS GONNA TELL
EVERYBODY ABOUT ALL MY LIES

22:49.933 --> 22:51.200
AND MY DECEIT.

22:51.233 --> 22:53.700
AND, YOU KNOW, I SAID TERRIBLE
THINGS ABOUT SO MANY PEOPLE.

22:53.733 --> 22:55.833
AND YOU AND JEFF
AND SUSIE AND LOUIS,

22:55.867 --> 22:57.100
EVERYBODY I KNOW AND...

22:57.133 --> 22:59.133
WHAT, WHAT HAVE
YOU SAID ABOUT ME ?

22:59.167 --> 23:00.933
OH, DID I SAY YOU ?
YEAH.

23:00.967 --> 23:01.967
NO, NO,
I DIDN'T MEAN YOU.

23:02.067 --> 23:04.200
NO, THE OTHERS,
THE OTHERS, NOT YOU.

23:04.233 --> 23:07.833
BUT THE POINT IS THAT I'M GONNA
BE RUINED, YOU UNDERSTAND ?

23:07.867 --> 23:09.100
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO MOVE.

23:09.133 --> 23:10.667
WELL, WHY WAS
SHE SO UPSET ?

23:10.700 --> 23:12.067
I DON'T KNOW, I YELLED
AT HER A LITTLE BIT.

23:12.067 --> 23:13.167
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO
SOME STUFF FOR ME.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.233
SHE DIDN'T DO IT.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.167
I'M SURE SHE'LL
BE FINE ONCE SHE...

23:16.200 --> 23:17.700
NO, SHE'S NOT
GONNA BE FINE.

23:17.733 --> 23:18.967
SHE HASN'T BEEN FINE SINCE SHE
BROKE UP WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

23:19.067 --> 23:21.967
THAT'S THE WHOLE
PROBLEM.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.667
SEE, NOW IF I COULD GET
THOSE TWO BACK TOGETHER.

23:26.733 --> 23:29.367
I NEED TO TALK
TO HER BOYFRIEND.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.667
I GOT WS FOR YOU.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.133
OKAY.

23:33.167 --> 23:34.800
THAT'S WHAT
I NEED TO DO.

23:48.067 --> 23:48.900
HEY, MARV.

23:48.933 --> 23:51.100
HI, LARRY.

23:51.133 --> 23:52.733

23:52.767 --> 23:54.400
OKAY, YEAH,
SIT DOWN.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.833
YEAH ?
YEAH, SURE.

23:56.867 --> 24:00.867
SO, UH, I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT ANTOINETTE.

24:00.900 --> 24:04.967
OH, UH, YEAH,
THAT'S A...

24:05.067 --> 24:07.367
THAT'S A TOUGH, UH,
A TOUGH SITUATION.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.900
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED.

24:08.933 --> 24:10.867
I MEAN YOU GUYS, YOU WERE
SUCH A GREAT COUPLE AND...

24:10.900 --> 24:13.367
YEAH, YOU KNOW, SHE'S A,
SHE'S A GREAT GAL.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.633
SHE REALLY IS,
I LOVE HER...

24:14.667 --> 24:17.167
SO WHAT ARE YOU
BREAKING UP WITH HER FOR ?

24:17.200 --> 24:20.067
YEAH, I JUST, WELL,
YOU KNOW, IT'S PERSONAL.

24:20.100 --> 24:22.667
I KNOW THAT'S
WHAT SHE SAID.

24:22.700 --> 24:24.367
IT'S, UH...

24:24.400 --> 24:25.933
POUR IT OUT, BUDDY.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.767
SEXUAL, SEXUAL.

24:29.800 --> 24:33.633
MARVIN, I'VE HAD EVERY SEXUAL
PROBLEM KNOWN TO MANKIND.

24:33.667 --> 24:35.067
WHAT IS IT,
YOU'RE IMPOTENT ?

24:35.067 --> 24:36.433
I'VE GONE 10 YEARS
WITH NO ERECTION,
WHAT IS THAT...

24:36.467 --> 24:39.933
NO, NO, NO, LARRY,
THAT'S NOT IT, IT'S NOT THAT.

24:39.967 --> 24:43.433
( sighing )

24:43.467 --> 24:45.267
WHEN THE RACE BEGINS...

24:45.300 --> 24:47.267
I'M AT THE FINISH LINE
JUST LIKE THAT,

24:47.300 --> 24:49.633
QUICK, QUICK,
I FINISH QUICK.

24:52.067 --> 24:54.600
HMM.

24:54.633 --> 24:56.167
IT'S TOUGH.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.400
HMM.

24:57.433 --> 25:02.767
( drums playing )

25:06.400 --> 25:07.733
MARV ?

25:07.767 --> 25:09.567
YES ?

25:11.967 --> 25:15.233
YOUR PROBLEMS
ARE OVER.

25:15.267 --> 25:17.067
EVERLAST CONDOM ?

25:17.067 --> 25:20.833
I'VE USED CONDOMS BEFORE,
LARRY, THEY DON'T HELP.

25:20.867 --> 25:23.067
YOU HAVEN'T
USED THIS ONE.

25:23.067 --> 25:25.767
ALL NIGHT, MY FRIEND...

25:25.800 --> 25:28.233
ALL NIGHT.

25:32.333 --> 25:35.167
I'VE JUST GOT ONE LITTLE
WORD OF ADVICE FOR YOU.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.667
DON'T WEAR IT
INSIDE OUT.

25:38.700 --> 25:40.067
THANKS, LARRY.

25:51.233 --> 25:54.367
( knocking )

25:54.400 --> 25:55.667
HEY.

25:55.700 --> 25:56.467
YEAH, LET ME GO

25:56.500 --> 25:58.733
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.500
HOW'S, UH,
HOW'S OSCAR ?

26:00.533 --> 26:02.067
HE'S NOT GOOD, LARRY.

26:02.067 --> 26:03.767
HE'S NOT GOOD,
HE'S THE SAME.

26:03.800 --> 26:05.867
HE HASN'T GOTTEN ANY BETTER
AND I KNOW YOU DID SOMETHING.

26:05.900 --> 26:07.367
I DIDN'T FORGET.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.367
( knocking )

26:08.400 --> 26:10.067
I'LL GET THAT.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.800
YEAH, GOOD,

26:11.833 --> 26:14.167
AH, WANDERING BEAR.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.333
NO, NO, I DON'T

26:15.367 --> 26:16.500
COME IN, COME IN.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.900
HELLO.
HELLO, DAVID.

26:19.767 --> 26:21.367
I'VE COME

26:21.400 --> 26:24.400

WHATEVER THE FUCK YOUR NAME IS.

26:24.433 --> 26:25.800
YOU WERE PAID
ALREADY, OKAY.

26:25.833 --> 26:27.400
YOU DON'T NEED
TO TALK LIKE THAT.

26:27.433 --> 26:28.967
YOU'RE A BETTER
PERSON THAN THAT.

26:29.067 --> 26:30.400
NO, SHE'S NOT.

26:30.433 --> 26:33.200
WE PAID YOU, THAT WAS IT,
I'D LIKE YOU OUT OF MY HOUSE.

26:33.233 --> 26:35.900
I NEED TO BE PAID
IN FULL PLEASE.

26:35.933 --> 26:37.733
IF YOU DON'T GET OUT OF MY HOUSE
I'M GONNA GET MY DOG, ALRIGHT ?

26:37.767 --> 26:39.433
SUSIE !
OSCAR !

26:39.467 --> 26:40.333
SUSIE, COME ON.

26:40.367 --> 26:42.633
OSCAR !
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.

26:46.500 --> 26:47.400
YOU SEE THIS ?

26:47.433 --> 26:48.467
HE'S USELESS,
HE'S USELESS.

26:48.500 --> 26:49.633
YOU SEE WHAT
YOU DID TO HIM ?

26:49.667 --> 26:53.400
HE'S USELESS, THIS USED
TO BE A WATCHDOG.

26:53.433 --> 26:55.633
MAY I TAKE
A LOOK AT HIM ?

26:55.667 --> 26:57.833
( sighing )

26:57.867 --> 27:00.867
FINE, FINE,
GO AHEAD.

27:06.500 --> 27:10.433
( singing )

27:36.867 --> 27:39.733
