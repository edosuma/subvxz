WEBVTT

00:11.900 --> 00:12.933
- PREVIOUSLY ON GREY'S ANATOMY.

00:12.967 --> 00:14.567
- I WANT TO SEATTLE GRACE
TO OPEN A FREE CLINIC?

00:14.600 --> 00:15.367
- WHY?

00:15.400 --> 00:18.067
- I NEED SOMETHING
TO HOLD ON TO.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.300
- YOU STILL NEED FUNDING.
- I HAVE $8 MILLION

00:20.333 --> 00:22.200
FOR THE DENNY DUQUETTE
MEMORIAL CLINIC.

00:22.233 --> 00:23.533
[overlapping shouting]

00:23.567 --> 00:25.267
- THEY ALL WANT TO BE CHIEF.

00:25.300 --> 00:27.267
- SHE'S IN A NURSING HOME
WITH ALZHEIMER'S.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.333
- I GAVE UP EVERYTHING FOR HIM.

00:28.367 --> 00:29.500
I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE HAD A KID.

00:29.533 --> 00:30.833
- MARRY ME, CRISTINA.

00:30.867 --> 00:32.700
- MARRY ME.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.300
- AS SURGEONS,

00:35.333 --> 00:38.433
WE LIVE IN A WORLD
OF WORST-CASE SCENARIOS.

00:38.467 --> 00:41.567
WE CUT OURSELVES OFF
FROM HOPING FOR THE BEST,

00:41.600 --> 00:43.067
BECAUSE TOO MANY TIMES

00:43.100 --> 00:45.467
THE BEST DOESN'T HAPPEN.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.333
BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN,

00:47.367 --> 00:50.233
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY OCCURS.

00:50.267 --> 00:53.133
[melancholy music]

00:53.167 --> 01:00.633
*

01:14.300 --> 01:17.433
AND SUDDENLY BEST-CASE SCENARIOS
SEEM POSSIBLE.

01:17.467 --> 01:19.700
- EIGHT DAYS, $8 MILLION.

01:19.733 --> 01:22.233
- AND WE ARE OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

01:22.267 --> 01:27.067
- AND EVERY NOW AND THEN,
SOMETHING AMAZING HAPPENS.

01:27.067 --> 01:29.233
- SHE WOKE UP THIS MORNING
COMPLETELY AWARE.

01:29.267 --> 01:30.533
SHE'S HER OLD SELF.
IT HAPPENS.

01:30.567 --> 01:32.400
MEDICALLY, WE DON'T KNOW WHY.

01:32.433 --> 01:33.567
IT'S JUST A RANDOM GIFT.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.200
- SO SHE'S LUCID?
SHE REMEMBERS?

01:35.233 --> 01:37.367
- PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING,
EXCEPT THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.067
AND, OF COURSE, SHE DOESN'T
REALIZE SHE HAS ALZHEIMER'S.

01:39.067 --> 01:41.267
WE THOUGHT
SHE SHOULD HEAR IT FROM YOU.

01:41.300 --> 01:43.167
- SO SHE'LL KNOW ME?

01:43.200 --> 01:45.467
I'M GONNA WALK IN THERE,
AND SHE'LL KNOW WHO I AM?

01:45.500 --> 01:47.633
- SHE'S BEEN ASKING FOR YOU.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.567
- AND AGAINST
OUR BETTER JUDGMENT,

01:49.600 --> 01:53.533
WE START TO HAVE HOPE.

01:53.567 --> 01:54.733
- HEY, CHIEF.
I NEED A SIGNATURE.

01:54.767 --> 01:57.133
I'D LIKE TO USE THE HELICOPTER
TO TRANSFER

01:57.167 --> 01:58.133
A PATIENT FROM DENVER.
- MORNING, CHIEF.

01:58.167 --> 01:59.200
I FOUND A WAY TO FUND
A STEREOTACTIC ROBOT.

01:59.233 --> 02:00.133
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE ON BOARD BEFORE WE...

02:00.167 --> 02:02.233
- IT'S A LITTLE EARLY
IN THE MORNING

02:02.267 --> 02:04.067
FOR YOU TWO
TO BE CHASING ME DOWN.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.300
- I'M GOING TO BE DOING

02:05.333 --> 02:06.767
A BLOODLESS PULMONARY VALVE
TRANSLOCATION ON THIS PATIENT.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.633
- THIS MACHINE
IS AN EXCELLENT SOURCE

02:08.667 --> 02:09.767
OF REVENUE FOR THIS HOSPITAL.
- AREN'T YOU GONNA GET IN THERE?

02:09.800 --> 02:10.800
IF YOU WANT TO BE CHIEF,

02:10.833 --> 02:12.433
YOU GOT TO FIGHT
WITH THE BIG BOYS.

02:12.467 --> 02:13.567
- WELL, I INTEND
TO FIGHT LIKE A GIRL.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.467
LET THEM KILL EACH OTHER,

02:15.500 --> 02:17.600
AND THEN I'LL BE
THE ONLY ONE LEFT STANDING.

02:17.633 --> 02:19.367
- AND THEN THERE'S ME.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.833
THERE YOU GO
UNDERESTIMATING ME AGAIN.

02:21.867 --> 02:23.333
- IT'S NOT THAT
I UNDERESTIMATE YOU.

02:23.367 --> 02:27.600
IT'S JUST THAT I DON'T
THINK ABOUT YOU...AT ALL.

02:27.633 --> 02:30.167
- WELL, YOU SHOULD.

02:30.200 --> 02:33.667
I WAS, UH, HEADING
DOWN TO THE CLINIC.

02:33.700 --> 02:36.400
IT'S OPENING TODAY,
AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE NICE

02:36.433 --> 02:37.633
TO SHOW DR. BAILEY
A LITTLE SUPPORT.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.367
- VERY THOUGHTFUL, DR. SLOAN.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.733
I THINK I'LL JOIN YOU.

02:41.767 --> 02:43.067
GENTLEMEN,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

02:43.067 --> 02:45.067
- CERTAINLY.

02:45.100 --> 02:47.400
NICELY DONE.

02:47.433 --> 02:49.067
- MEREDITH, WHAT IS GOING ON?

02:49.100 --> 02:50.133
WHEN DID YOU GET BACK
FROM EUROPE?

02:50.167 --> 02:52.733
- I WENT TO EUROPE
FOR TWO MONTHS, BUT THAT WAS...

02:52.767 --> 02:54.767
- I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
THINKING ABOUT THE FIGHT WE HAD.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.133
THE THINGS I SAID--
I-I-I SAID SOME TERRIBLE THINGS.

02:57.167 --> 02:58.667
- IT'S FINE.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.333
AFTER YOU LEFT, I-I WAS UPSET.

03:01.367 --> 03:03.133
DID I--DID I HAVE A BREAKDOWN?

03:03.167 --> 03:05.200
I MUST HAVE HAD
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

03:05.233 --> 03:06.833
I'M IN A--
IS THIS A HOSPITAL?

03:06.867 --> 03:08.367
BECAUSE I CAN'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING

03:08.400 --> 03:09.400
FOR THE PAST
TWO MONTHS, MEREDITH.

03:09.433 --> 03:11.467
THE LAST THING I REMEMBER
IS THE FIGHT WE HAD,

03:11.500 --> 03:13.733
AND--AND LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL,

03:13.767 --> 03:14.833
THAT IS FINE.
IT IS YOUR LIFE.

03:14.867 --> 03:16.733
JUST--JUST TAKE ME HOME.
- I WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL.

03:16.767 --> 03:20.100
- I WANT TO GO HOME, MEREDITH.
I NEED TO GO HOME.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.533
- YOU ARE HOME.

03:22.567 --> 03:25.333
I WENT TO EUROPE
FIVE YEARS AGO.

03:25.367 --> 03:26.700
YOU GOT SICK.

03:26.733 --> 03:29.333
YOU HAVE ALZHEIMER'S.

03:29.367 --> 03:31.433
THIS IS YOUR HOME.

03:31.467 --> 03:34.100
YOU LIVE HERE NOW.

03:34.133 --> 03:36.833
[dramatic music]

03:36.867 --> 03:38.200
*

03:38.233 --> 03:39.500
- NO!

03:39.533 --> 03:41.667
- MOM...
- NO!

03:41.700 --> 03:44.067
[sobs]

03:44.100 --> 03:45.800
- MOM?

03:45.833 --> 03:48.500
MOM!
SOMEBODY CALL 911!

03:54.167 --> 03:55.367
- SHE HAD SUBSTERNAL
CHEST PAINS--

03:55.400 --> 03:56.300
- CHEST PAINS AND SYNCOPE.

03:56.333 --> 03:57.433
MY PACE WAS IN THE 200s,

03:57.467 --> 03:59.333
BUT THE RATE HAS RESOLVED
ON ITS OWN.

03:59.367 --> 04:01.167
- SHE'S COMPLETELY LUCID.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.567
- SHE'S WHAT?

04:02.600 --> 04:04.600
- SHE'S AWARE.
SHE'S HERSELF AGAIN.

04:04.633 --> 04:07.400
- OH, MY GOD, IS THIS...
ARE WE IN SEATTLE GRACE?

04:07.433 --> 04:09.433
- YES, MOM. THIS IS WHERE
I'M DOING MY RESIDENCY.

04:09.467 --> 04:11.167
- YOUR DAUGHTER
IS ONE OF OUR FINEST INTERNS,

04:11.200 --> 04:13.267
FOLLOWING IN YOUR
VERY BIG FOOTSTEPS.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.100
- DO YOU KNOW A RICHARD WEBBER?

04:15.133 --> 04:16.800
IS HE STILL A DOCTOR HERE?

04:16.833 --> 04:18.133
- CHIEF?

04:18.167 --> 04:21.367
- RICHARD WEBBER'S THE CHIEF?
OF SURGERY?

04:21.400 --> 04:24.133
- OKAY, WELCOME TO THE
DENNY DUQUETTE MEMORIAL CLINIC.

04:24.167 --> 04:26.167
BARRING
ANY SURGICAL EMERGENCIES,

04:26.200 --> 04:28.133
YOU WILL BE WORKING HERE TODAY.

04:28.167 --> 04:30.367
- WORKING ON WHAT?

04:30.400 --> 04:32.833
RIGHT NOW OLIVIA
WILL BE FAMILIARIZING YOU

04:32.867 --> 04:35.200
WITH THE PROTOCOL
FOR THE FLU VACCINE.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.467
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T--DON'T TOUCH THAT.

04:37.500 --> 04:41.067
THAT WAS $79.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.433
- OH, MY GOD, I HAVE GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

04:43.467 --> 04:46.733
BURKE HAS A BLOODLESS
PULMONARY VALVE TRANSLOCATION

04:46.767 --> 04:47.733
FLYING IN
FROM DENVER TOMORROW.

04:47.767 --> 04:48.933
I SHOULD BE PREPARING.

04:48.967 --> 04:50.633
- YOU DON'T GET TO SCRUB IN
ON THAT VALVE TRANSLOCATION.

04:50.667 --> 04:52.800
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- 'CAUSE I AM.

04:52.833 --> 04:54.633
- HE PICKED YOU?
- YOU GUYS READY?

04:54.667 --> 04:56.367
- WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

04:56.400 --> 04:57.700
- UH, GREY WILL BE LATE.

04:57.733 --> 04:59.467
O'MALLEY SHOULD BE BACK
FROM VACATION.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.533
- NO, NO, NO, THE PATIENTS.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.567
THE UNDERSERVED,
UNINSURED POPULATION

05:02.600 --> 05:03.833
THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE HELPING.

05:03.867 --> 05:06.067
- THE UNDERSERVED,
UNINSURED WILL COME.

05:06.067 --> 05:07.433
YOU'LL SEE.
JUST WATCH THE DOOR.

05:07.467 --> 05:08.833
THEY WILL COME THROUGH IT.

05:08.867 --> 05:10.133
- I CAN'T WAIT
FOR THE FIRST PATIENTS.

05:10.167 --> 05:11.667
IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING.

05:11.700 --> 05:15.067
IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING WHAT
DENNY'S MONEY CAN DO, RIGHT?

05:15.100 --> 05:16.800
- JUST WATCH THE DOOR, STEVENS.

05:27.167 --> 05:28.133
- DR. BAILEY,

05:28.167 --> 05:31.367
CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE OPENING OF THE CLINIC.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.233
- IT IS OPEN, ISN'T IT?

05:36.133 --> 05:37.600
IS STEVENS ALL RIGHT?

05:37.633 --> 05:39.500
- SHE'S WATCHING THE DOOR, SIR.

05:39.533 --> 05:42.600
- OKAY.

05:46.467 --> 05:49.200
- SOMEONE'S COMING!

05:49.233 --> 05:50.133
DAMN IT!

05:50.167 --> 05:51.467
- O'MALLEY, WELCOME BACK.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.067
YOU'RE LATE.

05:57.667 --> 05:59.433
- IS O'MALLEY ALL RIGHT?

05:59.467 --> 06:02.333
- WE GOT MARRIED IN VEGAS!

06:06.800 --> 06:10.333
WE'RE MARRIED!

06:10.367 --> 06:13.267
- [laughs]
SHE'S--SHE'S CALLIE O'MALLEY.

06:27.633 --> 06:28.833
- IT'S FAST, YOU KNOW?

06:28.867 --> 06:31.800
IT SEEMS REALLY VERY FAST.

06:31.833 --> 06:33.500
ARE--ARE YOU EVEN HAPPY?

06:33.533 --> 06:34.633
- WE'RE INCREDIBLY HAPPY.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.700
- OH, YAY.
WELL, GREAT. YAY.

06:36.733 --> 06:39.367
- SHOW HER THE RING.
- OH.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.233
- OH.
THAT'S SO GREAT.

06:42.267 --> 06:43.200
WITHOUT ANY DIAMONDS OR RUBIES,

06:43.233 --> 06:46.200
YOU KNOW NO ONE WILL EVER TRY
TO STEAL IT.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.100
- OKAY, THAT'S IT.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.767
YANG, BURKE NEEDS YOU
IN CARDIO.

06:51.800 --> 06:52.767
O'MALLEY, THE CHIEF

06:52.800 --> 06:54.700
HAS A SURGICAL PATIENT COMING
INTO THE PIT.

06:54.733 --> 06:57.533
STEVENS, KAREV,
GO FIND ME SOME PATIENTS.

06:57.567 --> 07:00.333
I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU GET THEM.
JUST GET THEM.

07:00.367 --> 07:01.633
CONGRATULATIONS.

07:01.667 --> 07:03.467
- THANK YOU.
- THANKS.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.300
- OKAY, WE'VE BEEN OUT
OF OUR VEGAS HOTEL ROOM

07:05.333 --> 07:06.433
ONLY FOR SIX HOURS,
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.133
- IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

07:08.167 --> 07:10.833
WE'RE MARRIED.

07:10.867 --> 07:12.133
- WE'RE MARRIED.

07:16.867 --> 07:19.667
- SO, CHIEF, WE'RE A COUPLE
OF MARRIED MEN.

07:19.700 --> 07:24.433
- UH, ADELE AND I ARE GETTING
A DIVORCE.

07:24.467 --> 07:27.467
- UH...UM...I DIDN'T...

07:27.500 --> 07:29.400
- THAT'S LIFE, O'MALLEY.

07:29.433 --> 07:32.367
THAT'S LIFE.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.133
NOW, THIS PATIENT.

07:34.167 --> 07:36.767
I REMOVED A LARGE TUMOR
FROM HER COLON EIGHT MONTHS AGO.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.667
SINCE THEN, SHE'S BEEN
UNDERGOING CHEMO AND RADIATION.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.067
WE THOUGHT SHE HAD IT BEAT.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.600
- EXCUSE ME?

07:42.633 --> 07:44.433
ARE YOU THE DOCTORS
FOR MARINA WAGNER?

07:44.467 --> 07:45.633
- YES, YOU BROUGHT HER IN?

07:45.667 --> 07:47.200
- I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,
AND SHE WAS BARELY BREATHING.

07:47.233 --> 07:48.200
YOU THINK THIS COULD BE
FOOD POISONING?

07:48.233 --> 07:50.267
'CAUSE WE HAD SUSHI YESTERDAY,
BUT I FEEL FINE.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.133
- COULD BE COMPLICATIONS
FROM THE RADIATION.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.233
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, RADIATION?

07:53.267 --> 07:54.700
- FROM HER CANCER TREATMENT.

07:54.733 --> 07:56.433
- SHE DOESN'T HAVE CANCER.

07:56.467 --> 07:59.100
I'M HER BOYFRIEND.
I'D KNOW.

07:59.133 --> 08:01.233
- O'MALLEY, GET A CBC,

08:01.267 --> 08:04.633
A CHEM-19, AND A TRIPLE-CONTRAST
ABDOMINAL CT.

08:04.667 --> 08:06.067
EXCUSE ME.
- YES, SIR.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.333
- IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
- SHE'S...

08:11.367 --> 08:13.533
- RICHARD.
MY GOD, YOU'VE AGED.

08:13.567 --> 08:17.100
- ELLIS?
- I WAS HAVING ARRHYTHMIAS.

08:17.133 --> 08:18.300
THEY WANTED TO DO TESTS.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.800
I HEAR THAT YOU'RE
THE CHIEF OF SURGERY NOW.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.067
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.767
- YES...

08:23.800 --> 08:25.633
BUT I'M STEPPING DOWN, SO...

08:25.667 --> 08:27.533
- STEPPING DOWN?

08:27.567 --> 08:31.267
WELL, I CAN ONLY ASSUME
THAT WAS ADELE'S IDEA.

08:31.300 --> 08:34.100
MEREDITH.
- I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, MOM.

08:34.133 --> 08:36.200
GO AHEAD.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.800
SHE IS LUCID.

08:40.833 --> 08:43.567
SHE WOKE UP THIS MORNING
WITH HER MEMORY BACK.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.800
THEY SAY IT'S TEMPORARY.

08:44.833 --> 08:47.700
- MY GOD.

08:47.733 --> 08:50.500
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT WORK TODAY.

08:50.533 --> 08:51.800
I MEAN, YOU NEED TO BE
WITH HER.

08:51.833 --> 08:55.433
I MEAN, THIS TIME...

08:55.467 --> 08:59.200
IT'S A GIFT.
- IT'S A GIFT.

08:59.233 --> 09:03.100
RIGHT.

09:05.367 --> 09:08.300
- MEREDITH'S MOTHER
HAD SOME RUNS OF SVT.

09:08.333 --> 09:11.200
I'M ORDERING AN ECHO.
AND SHE'S LUCID.

09:11.233 --> 09:12.667
- WHAT?

09:12.700 --> 09:14.467
- IT HAPPENS,
BUT IT WON'T LAST.

09:14.500 --> 09:15.633
- IS MEREDITH OKAY?

09:15.667 --> 09:17.300
- SEEMS FINE,
BUT HER MOTHER'S GONNA NEED

09:17.333 --> 09:18.100
THE BEST CARE
WE HAVE TO OFFER.

09:18.133 --> 09:21.067
AND YOU, DR. YANG,
ARE THE BEST.

09:25.333 --> 09:26.733
YOU'RE STILL NOT WEARING
THE RING.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.067
I WOULD LIKE AN ANSWER.
IT'S BEEN OVER A WEEK.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.833
- I TOLD YOU.
IT'S UNDER ADVISEMENT.

09:30.867 --> 09:33.700
- OH, DO YOU NOT LIKE THE RING?
- IT'S A RING.

09:33.733 --> 09:35.700
IT'S THREE-CARAT,
DIAMOND-CUT, PLATINUM.

09:35.733 --> 09:37.533
IT'S--IT'S THE RING.

09:37.567 --> 09:38.633
- THEN WHAT?

09:41.433 --> 09:43.433
- ARE YOU USING
THE SURGERY TOMORROW

09:43.467 --> 09:45.267
TO PRESSURE ME
INTO GIVING YOU AN ANSWER?

09:45.300 --> 09:46.833
IS THAT WHY
I'M NOT SCRUBBING IN?

09:46.867 --> 09:49.200
- I NEED TO GIVE
THE OTHER INTERNS A CHANCE.

09:49.233 --> 09:53.100
- WHY?
- THE ECHO, PLEASE, DR. YANG.

09:57.667 --> 10:01.600
- HEY.
YOU BEEN WAITING LONG?

10:01.633 --> 10:03.433
- ALMOST AN HOUR.
- MM.

10:03.467 --> 10:05.600
- ARE YOU MY DOCTOR?
- I CAN BE.

10:05.633 --> 10:07.367
WE HAVE A CLINIC
RIGHT OUTSIDE THOSE DOORS.

10:07.400 --> 10:11.100
THERE'S NO WAIT.
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

10:11.133 --> 10:14.067
- IT HURTS WHEN I PEE.
- OH! WE CAN HELP WITH THAT.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.767
- YEAH, IT'S EASY.
IT'S NOTHING.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.800
WE COULD HAVE YOU OUT OF HERE
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.

10:18.833 --> 10:21.667
- ARE YOU HITTING ON ME?
- [laughs]

10:21.700 --> 10:23.567
WE NEED PATIENTS.
YOU NEED DOCTORS.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.667
AND WE JUST HAPPEN
TO BE SURGEONS.

10:24.700 --> 10:27.367
- YOU THINK I NEED SURGERY?

10:27.400 --> 10:28.300
- YOU NEVER KNOW.

10:28.333 --> 10:31.033
- IT'S FREE, A FREE CLINIC.

10:31.067 --> 10:32.467
- BUT MY CO-PAY'S
ONLY TEN BUCKS.

10:32.500 --> 10:37.700
- THAT'S LUNCH.
- [coughing]

10:37.733 --> 10:39.233
- SOUNDS LIKE TB.

10:39.267 --> 10:40.767
- VERY CONTAGIOUS.

10:48.700 --> 10:52.367
- YOU AND MEREDITH
ARE GOOD FRIENDS?

10:52.400 --> 10:54.333
I CAN TELL,

10:54.367 --> 10:57.167
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
TO LOOK AT ME,

10:57.200 --> 10:59.733
AS IF I MIGHT ASK YOU
SOME PERSONAL QUESTION ABOUT HER

10:59.767 --> 11:05.233
AND YOU'LL ACCIDENTALLY SLIP.

11:05.267 --> 11:07.400
BUT YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING
ACCIDENTALLY, DO YOU?

11:09.667 --> 11:12.333
HAS MEREDITH CHOSEN
A SPECIALTY?

11:12.367 --> 11:14.200
- THAT'S A PERSONAL QUESTION.

11:14.233 --> 11:16.267
- FOR SURGEONS, THE MOST
PERSONAL QUESTION YOU CAN ASK.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.300
IT TELLS YOU WHO THEY ARE.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.300
- MY MOTHER WOULD WANT TO KNOW
WHETHER I HAD A BOYFRIEND.

11:20.333 --> 11:24.200
- YOUR MOTHER SOUNDS
LIKE A FRIVOLOUS WOMAN.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.667
- IF I CHOSE CARDIOTHORACICS,
WHAT WOULD THAT SAY ABOUT ME?

11:29.700 --> 11:31.567
- HEART SURGEONS
ARE THE KNOW-IT-ALLS.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.400
THEY'RE THE MOST AMBITIOUS,
THE MOST DRIVEN.

11:33.433 --> 11:34.500
THEY WANT IT ALL,
AND THEY WANT IT NOW.

11:34.533 --> 11:37.400
AND THEY DON'T WANT ANYTHING
GETTING IN THEIR WAY.

11:39.267 --> 11:44.067
MEREDITH SAYS I'M PART OF
AN ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH STUDY.

11:44.067 --> 11:44.900
I WANT A NEURO CONSULT

11:44.933 --> 11:48.533
WITH THE DOCTOR
WHO PUT ME IN THE TRIAL.

11:48.567 --> 11:51.700
- HEY, MER,
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

11:51.733 --> 11:52.800
BURKE HAS ME ON YOUR MOM.

11:52.833 --> 11:54.467
ARE YOU OKAY?
- I'M AVOIDING HER.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.467
I'M AVOIDING THE GIFT.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.567
- YEAH, WELL,
YOUR GIFT WANTS TO MEET DEREK.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.367
- WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

11:59.400 --> 12:01.067
- NO, NO, NO, NOT DEREK,
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.267
DR. SHEPHERD, THE NEUROSURGEON.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.067
SHE'S GONNA KNOW
THAT HE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND ANYWAY.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.067
SHE HAS WAYS.

12:05.067 --> 12:06.167
I'M KIND OF IN LOVE WITH HER,
BY THE WAY.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.200
- SHE HAS THAT EFFECT ON PEOPLE
WHO AREN'T HER DAUGHTER.

12:08.233 --> 12:11.267
- HEY, I HEARD
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.733
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
- YEAH, IT'S A GIFT.

12:12.767 --> 12:14.667
- SHE'S AVOIDING HER.
- MER, SHE'S YOUR MOTHER.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.300
AND SHE'S REALLY HERE.
- THIS IS YOUR CHANCE.

12:16.333 --> 12:17.200
YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER.

12:17.233 --> 12:18.433
- YOU SHOULD SPEND
SOME TIME WITH HER.

12:18.467 --> 12:20.500
- SHE HAS A VERY LONG HISTORY
OF BEING DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

12:20.533 --> 12:21.600
- YOU'RE A DOCTOR NOW.

12:21.633 --> 12:24.067
PARENTAL DISAPPOINTMENT ENDS
WITH A MEDICAL DEGREE.

12:24.100 --> 12:27.133
- CAN WE GET MOVING?
IT HURTS WHEN I PEE.

12:27.167 --> 12:29.167
- ARE YOU STEALING PATIENTS
FROM THE E.R.?

12:29.200 --> 12:31.233
- YES, BUT ONLY
BECAUSE I HAVE TO KNOW

12:31.267 --> 12:32.833
THAT I DID NOT SPEND
MY ENTIRE INHERITANCE

12:32.867 --> 12:34.800
ON AN EMPTY ROOM
WITH EMPTY BEDS,

12:34.833 --> 12:36.700
BECAUSE IF I DID THAT,
I MIGHT GO CRAZY,

12:36.733 --> 12:37.767
AND GEORGE CALLED DIBS
ON CRAZY.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.333
DO YOU THINK CALLIE'S PREGNANT?

12:39.367 --> 12:40.333
- I'M GOING BACK TO THE E.R.

12:40.367 --> 12:41.467
- OKAY, JUST KEEP
YOUR PANTS ON.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.500
- WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:43.533 --> 12:45.400
- OH, YEAH,
BAMBI GOT MARRIED.

12:45.433 --> 12:48.233
- PSST.

12:48.267 --> 12:52.067
- EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND.

12:52.067 --> 12:53.100
EVERYTHING OKAY?
YOU OFF TODAY?

12:53.133 --> 12:55.600
- YOU GOT MARRIED?

12:55.633 --> 12:57.533
- YEAH, I DID.

12:57.567 --> 13:00.333
IT WAS--
I KNOW IT WAS IMPULSIVE.

13:00.367 --> 13:02.333
- WELL, WAS IT GOOD IMPULSIVE,
OR WAS IT MEREDITH IMPULSIVE?

13:02.367 --> 13:03.567
BECAUSE IF IT WAS
MEREDITH IMPULSIVE,

13:03.600 --> 13:04.733
MAYBE I CAN HELP GET YOU
OUT OF IT.

13:04.767 --> 13:08.067
- NO, NO, IT'S A--
IT'S A GOOD THING.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.400
IT'S A GOOD THING.
- GOOD.

13:09.433 --> 13:12.167
- UM, BUT THANKS FOR THE BACKUP.

13:12.200 --> 13:15.100
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
CONGRATULATIONS, GEORGE.

13:15.133 --> 13:18.067
- THANK YOU.

13:20.733 --> 13:23.600
- ARE YOU PLANNING ON COMING
TO TALK TO ME ANYTIME SOON?

13:39.067 --> 13:40.333
- EXCUSE ME.

13:41.333 --> 13:43.800
- YOU KNOW THOSE CARTOONS

13:43.833 --> 13:45.633
WHERE THERE'S A BEAR, UH,
OR WHATEVER,

13:45.667 --> 13:47.633
AND IT'S STARVING,
AND IT LOOKS AT A TABLE.

13:47.667 --> 13:50.267
AND THE TABLE TURNS INTO THIS
DELICIOUS COOKED TURKEY

13:50.300 --> 13:51.567
WITH, LIKE, LINES
OF DELICIOUSNESS JUST COMING...

13:51.600 --> 13:56.400
- OH, I WAS NOT LOOKING AT HIM
LIKE THAT,

13:56.433 --> 13:57.400
BECAUSE HE IS THE HELP,

13:57.433 --> 14:00.167
AND I AM NOT GOING TO BE
SLEEPING WITH THE HELP.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.067
- I MARRIED THE HELP.
- WHAT?

14:02.067 --> 14:05.067
- WE WENT TO VEGAS.
MY IDEA, I EMBRACE THE TRASHY.

14:05.067 --> 14:07.733
- THAT'S...NOT THAT I'M NOT
HAPPY FOR YOU,

14:07.767 --> 14:10.067
BUT...WHY? MARRIED, SO FAST?

14:10.067 --> 14:11.633
- YOU KNOW THOSE CARTOONS
WHERE THERE'S A BEAR,

14:11.667 --> 14:14.733
AND IT'S STARVING,
AND IT LOOKS AT A CUTE INTERN?

14:14.767 --> 14:17.367
- WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

14:17.400 --> 14:21.167
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.233
OH, IT'S SMALL.
I KNOW, IT'S SMALL.

14:23.267 --> 14:24.667
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

14:24.700 --> 14:26.233
- YOU THINK SO?
- YES.

14:26.267 --> 14:28.533
- YES.

14:28.567 --> 14:31.567
- SO TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF.

14:33.467 --> 14:35.433
- WELL...

14:35.467 --> 14:38.167
- WHAT'S YOUR LIFE LIKE?

14:38.200 --> 14:39.533
I...

14:39.567 --> 14:43.067
[sighs] REALLY DO WANT
TO KNOW YOU, MEREDITH.

14:43.067 --> 14:45.267
- WELL, I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.100
- DOES HE UNDERSTAND THE DEMANDS
OF YOUR CAREER?

14:47.133 --> 14:48.233
BECAUSE NOT ALL MEN DO.

14:48.267 --> 14:50.067
THEY SAY THEY DO UPFRONT,
BUT THEY...

14:50.067 --> 14:51.700
- HE'S GREAT. HE'S A DOCTOR TOO,
SO HE GETS IT.

14:51.733 --> 14:53.700
- GOOD.
- HE'S ACTUALLY...

14:53.733 --> 14:54.700
- HAVE YOU CHOSEN A SPECIALTY?

14:54.733 --> 14:57.067
- NO, IT'S--IT'S STILL EARLY.

14:57.067 --> 14:58.500
- CRISTINA'S ALREADY CHOSEN
CARDIOTHORACICS.

14:58.533 --> 15:03.267
- YEAH, WELL, I GUESS
I'M JUST WAITING TO BE INSPIRED.

15:03.300 --> 15:04.367
I'M HAPPY NOW.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.433
YOU KNOW, I FEEL
LIKE I KNOW WHO I AM,

15:06.467 --> 15:08.167
PLUS, I THINK WHEN YOU HAVE
SOMEONE IN YOUR LIFE

15:08.200 --> 15:10.800
THAT YOU LOVE, YOU REALLY LOVE,
I THINK THAT'S...

15:10.833 --> 15:13.533
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST...

15:15.067 --> 15:16.667
I'M REALLY HAPPY.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.500
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

15:18.533 --> 15:20.500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- YOU'RE HAPPY?

15:20.533 --> 15:22.400
YOU'RE HAPPY NOW?

15:22.433 --> 15:24.167
THE MEREDITH I KNEW
WAS A FORCE OF NATURE--

15:24.200 --> 15:26.167
PASSIONATE, FOCUSED, A FIGHTER.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.633
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
YOU'VE GONE SOFT.

15:27.667 --> 15:29.167
STAMMERING ABOUT A BOYFRIEND

15:29.200 --> 15:30.467
AND SAYING THAT YOU'RE WAITING
TO BE INSPIRED.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.333
YOU'RE WAITING FOR INSPIRATION?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

15:32.367 --> 15:34.067
I HAVE A DISEASE
FOR WHICH THERE IS NO CURE.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.633
I THINK THAT WOULD BE
INSPIRATION ENOUGH.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.733
- MOM...
- LISTEN TO ME, MEREDITH.

15:37.767 --> 15:41.467
ANYONE CAN FALL IN LOVE
AND BE BLINDLY HAPPY,

15:41.500 --> 15:44.333
BUT NOT EVERYONE CAN PICK UP
A SCALPEL AND SAVE A LIFE.

15:44.367 --> 15:48.233
I RAISED YOU TO BE
AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN BEING.

15:48.267 --> 15:50.567
SO IMAGINE MY DISAPPOINTMENT
WHEN I WAKE UP AFTER FIVE YEARS

15:50.600 --> 15:55.233
AND DISCOVER THAT YOU'RE NO MORE
THAN ORDINARY.

15:55.267 --> 15:57.700
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

16:03.433 --> 16:04.467
- WE LIVE IN THE SAME BUILDING,

16:04.500 --> 16:06.267
SO I'D SEE HER
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM,

16:06.300 --> 16:08.400
AND, UH, SHE'S REALLY SEXY
WHEN SHE FOLDS CLOTHES.

16:08.433 --> 16:10.400
ONCE WE STARTED DATING.
IT WAS JUST LIKE, BOOM.

16:10.433 --> 16:12.800
WE GOT REALLY SERIOUS,
REALLY FAST.

16:12.833 --> 16:14.733
NOW I'M JUST KIND OF LIKE...

16:14.767 --> 16:16.200
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HER MIDDLE NAME.

16:16.233 --> 16:18.267
TRYING TO FILL OUT THESE FORMS,

16:18.300 --> 16:19.567
AND I'M STUMPED
ON THE FIRST QUESTION.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.533
- ROSE.

16:22.567 --> 16:25.200
THAT'S HER MIDDLE NAME--ROSE.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.167
- SHE'S CHARMING.
SHE'S FABULOUS.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.600
AND THEN, SUDDENLY,
SHE'S THE ENEMY.

16:33.633 --> 16:34.833
- I'M MEETING THE ENEMY?

16:34.867 --> 16:36.067
- JUST DON'T GET PERSONAL.

16:36.067 --> 16:36.733
- YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

16:36.767 --> 16:37.700
- I AM NOT BEING RIDICULOUS.

16:37.733 --> 16:39.333
- OKAY, IT'S GOING TO BE FINE.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.700
- JUST BE CAREFUL.
SHE HAS WAYS.

16:42.833 --> 16:43.833
- HI, GEORGE.
- HI.

16:43.867 --> 16:45.500
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

16:45.533 --> 16:48.800
- YOU SEEM KIND OF SHAKY
AND SWEATY AND PALE.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.833
IS IT THE MARRIAGE?
ARE YOU TOTALLY REGRETTING IT?

16:50.867 --> 16:51.667
- NO, THE MARRIAGE IS FINE.

16:51.700 --> 16:54.367
DO YOU MIND
TAKING THAT TO, UH...

16:54.400 --> 16:57.333
TAKING THE BLOOD WORK
TO THE LAB FOR ME?

16:57.367 --> 16:58.433
- SURE.

16:58.467 --> 17:00.433
- THANKS.
I THINK I NEED TO SIT DOWN.

17:00.467 --> 17:02.800
- GEORGE,
IF YOU NEED TO TALK...

17:02.833 --> 17:05.300
- THANKS.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.800
- HEY. ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU'RE SWEATING.

17:07.833 --> 17:09.667
- I'M GOOD.
WHAT'S YOUR MIDDLE NAME?

17:09.700 --> 17:11.367
- IT'S BAD.
I DON'T TELL ANYONE.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.300
- COME ON, WE'RE MARRIED,

17:12.333 --> 17:15.333
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW
YOUR MIDDLE NAME.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.667
- OKAY, I KNEW IT.

17:17.700 --> 17:18.700
IT'S YOUR WEIRD
AND JUDGY FRIENDS.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.367
YOU LET THEM GET TO YOU.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.833
- NO, IT'S...I DON'T...

17:21.867 --> 17:24.200
I DON'T KNOW YOUR MIDDLE NAME.

17:24.233 --> 17:25.667
I CAN'T--I CAN BARELY BREATHE.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.633
- YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DIDN'T KNOW
MY MIDDLE NAME LAST WEEK,

17:27.667 --> 17:30.633
AND YOU COULD BREATHE JUST FINE.
- WHAT?

17:30.667 --> 17:33.167
- WHAT ABOUT A FUNCTIONAL MRI
NOW, WHILE I'M LUCID?

17:33.200 --> 17:37.367
- MM. AN MRIs NOT GONNA
SHOW US ANYTHING NEW.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.733
NO TEST IS GONNA HELP US
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON.

17:39.767 --> 17:43.200
- SO IN FIVE YEARS,
YOU'VE MADE NO ADVANCES,

17:43.233 --> 17:46.200
AND THERE IS NOTHING ELSE
YOU CAN DO FOR ME.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.667
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT,

17:47.700 --> 17:50.633
DAY IN AND DAY OUT, WORK WITH
PEOPLE WITH THIS AWFUL DISEASE.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.533
- OH, I--

17:52.567 --> 17:57.300
UH, SEE, ACTUALLY, I'M NOT
AN ALZHEIMER'S SPECIALIST.

17:57.333 --> 18:00.833
I JUST TOOK A SPECIAL INTEREST
IN THIS CASE...

18:00.867 --> 18:03.133
BECAUSE OF MEREDITH.

18:03.167 --> 18:05.067
- YOU'RE WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.
- I'M SORRY...

18:05.067 --> 18:06.167
- I THOUGHT
YOU WERE HERE FOR ME,

18:06.200 --> 18:07.533
TO OFFER ME SOME HOPE,
TO TELL ME

18:07.567 --> 18:09.067
ABOUT SOME NEW TREATMENT,
BUT YOU'RE HERE FOR HER.

18:09.100 --> 18:10.200
- DR. GREY.

18:10.233 --> 18:11.200
- AN ATTENDING?
A NEUROSURGEON?

18:11.233 --> 18:12.233
NO WONDER SHE'S SO UNFOCUSED.

18:12.267 --> 18:13.200
- I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND--

18:13.233 --> 18:14.600
- OH, I UNDERSTAND.
I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY.

18:14.633 --> 18:15.733
I'VE SEEN MEN LIKE YOU BEFORE,

18:15.767 --> 18:17.533
THREATENED BY A WOMAN
WHO'S THEIR EQUAL.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.600
YOU JUST WANT SOMEONE
TO ADMIRE YOU,

18:19.633 --> 18:21.300
LIKE YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE DAMAGE

18:21.333 --> 18:22.533
YOU DO TO HER ALONG THE WAY.

18:24.833 --> 18:27.200
- I NEED TO LAY DOWN.

18:27.233 --> 18:29.067
- WHOA. NO, NO, NO.
HEY, HEY, HEY.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.067
BUSTER, DO YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO HAVE...

18:31.067 --> 18:32.300
THESE LINENS LAUNDERED?

18:32.333 --> 18:33.767
- I'M SICK, SHAKY, AND SWEATY.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.333
MY MOUTH IS DRY.
MY BODY ACHES.

18:36.367 --> 18:38.500
- FINE.

18:38.533 --> 18:40.500
- UH, KAREV,
REPLACE O'MALLEY IN THE O.R.

18:40.533 --> 18:41.667
- YES.

18:41.700 --> 18:45.067
- SO, THIS IS MARINA WAGNER,
YOUR COLON CANCER PATIENT?

18:45.067 --> 18:46.433
- KAREV, WHERE THE HELL'S
O'MALLEY?

18:46.467 --> 18:47.633
- CURLED UP IN A BALL
IN THE CLINIC.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.533
- HE OKAY?
- UH, HE'S MARRIED.

18:49.567 --> 18:54.067
- RIGHT.
OKAY, BOKI, TEN-BLADE.

18:59.733 --> 19:02.100
- STOLEN,
NON-EMERGENT E.R. CASES

19:02.133 --> 19:03.467
AND A SICK HOSPITAL STAFF.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.167
THIS IS WHAT $8 MILLION
BUYS YOU.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.333
- DR. STEVENS,
I SWEAR ON MY LIFE,

19:07.367 --> 19:09.267
IF I HEAR YOU SAY $8 MILLION
ONE MORE TIME...

19:09.300 --> 19:10.167
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY.

19:10.200 --> 19:13.100
IT'S...IT'S DENNY.

19:13.133 --> 19:14.600
IT'S HIS LEGACY.

19:14.633 --> 19:16.500
IT'S--I WAS LOOKING
FOR MEANING.

19:16.533 --> 19:18.067
THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE MEANINGFUL.

19:18.067 --> 19:19.100
- IT WILL BE MEANINGFUL.

19:19.133 --> 19:21.333
- $8 MILLION WORTH?

19:21.367 --> 19:24.500
- UH, EXCUSE ME,
ARE--ARE--ARE YOU, UH...?

19:24.533 --> 19:26.167
CAN I...?
ARE YOU DOCTORS?

19:26.200 --> 19:28.400
- YES, WE ARE.
- ARE YOU A PATIENT?

19:28.433 --> 19:30.267
LIKE AN ACTUAL,
FREE CLINIC PATIENT?

19:30.300 --> 19:31.767
- NOT ME.
MY DAUGHTER.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.167
- SO YOUR DAUGHTER'S SICK?

19:33.200 --> 19:35.533
- I'M NOT SICK.
CAN WE PLEASE GO?

19:35.567 --> 19:37.833
- KELLY FINDS SUDDENLY

19:37.867 --> 19:40.233
THAT SHE HAS A NEED
FOR THESE PRODUCTS,

19:40.267 --> 19:43.667
AND, UH--AND WE WERE HOPING

19:43.700 --> 19:47.800
THAT YOU MIGHT SHOW HER
HOW TO USE THEM.

19:52.700 --> 19:54.633
- GEORGE YOU'RE MARRIED.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.600
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY.
YOU DON'T LOOK HAPPY.

19:56.633 --> 19:57.700
- I'M SICK, OLIVIA.

19:57.733 --> 19:59.467
- ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN...

19:59.500 --> 20:01.167
YOU SHOULD GO HOME, O'MALLEY.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.767
CLEARLY, WHATEVER YOU HAVE
IS CONTAGIOUS.

20:03.800 --> 20:04.733
- AREN'T YOU FROM THE LAB?

20:04.767 --> 20:06.367
- YEAH, I FEEL LIKE CRAP.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.567
- IS THAT THE LADY
YOU GAVE MARINA'S BLOOD TO?

20:08.600 --> 20:10.700
- UH, YEAH.

20:10.733 --> 20:11.667
- AND YOU ALL FEEL SHAKY
AND NAUSEOUS?

20:11.700 --> 20:14.567
- IT'S AWFUL.

20:14.600 --> 20:15.500
- SHE'S TOXIC.

20:15.533 --> 20:18.333
- CALLIE, YEAH.
A LOT OF US FEEL THAT WAY.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.667
- NO, THE PATIENT'S BLOOD
IS TOXIC. IT'S MAKING US SICK.

20:20.700 --> 20:23.100
HAS THE CHIEF STARTED, UH,
MARINA'S OPERATION?

20:23.133 --> 20:25.733
- THEY WERE WHEELING HER UP
AS I CAME DOWN.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.200
- WHAT'S THE EXTENSION
FOR O.R. ONE?

20:27.233 --> 20:30.133
[phone ringing]

20:40.267 --> 20:41.200
- THE PATIENT'S BLOOD
IS APPARENTLY HIGHLY TOXIC.

20:41.233 --> 20:42.133
ANY CONTACT IS DANGEROUS.

20:42.167 --> 20:43.067
NOBODY GOES IN THERE
UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT

20:43.100 --> 20:46.333
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.
HOW'S HE DOING?

20:46.367 --> 20:48.400
- HIS BP'S STARTING
TO STABILIZE.

20:48.433 --> 20:49.833
HE'S DOING BETTER ON OXYGEN.

20:49.867 --> 20:51.133
IT'S A GOOD THING HE GOT OUT
OF THERE WHEN HE DID.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.733
- DR. SHEPHERD.
- WHAT IS IT?

20:52.767 --> 20:54.400
- CAN YOU SIGN THIS?
-I JUST HEARD. HOW CAN I HELP?

20:54.433 --> 20:55.567
- YOU'RE OFF-DUTY.
YOU SHOULD BE WITH YOUR MOTHER.

20:55.600 --> 20:56.700
- I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TIME
WITH MY MOTHER.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.333
THE CHIEF IS DOWN.
ALEX IS DOWN.

20:58.367 --> 20:59.767
I WOULD LIKE TO HELP.
- DR. GREY!

20:59.800 --> 21:02.400
YOU WANT TO HELP,
TALK TO YOUR RESIDENT.

21:04.467 --> 21:05.633
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

21:05.667 --> 21:07.067
- THEY FOUND AN HERBAL
SUPPLEMENT IN HER PURSE.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.200
THE LAB GUYS THINK IT COMBINED

21:09.233 --> 21:10.667
WITH THE CHEMO CHEMICALS
AND TURNED HER BLOOD

21:10.700 --> 21:11.800
INTO SOME KIND OF NEUROTOXIN.

21:11.833 --> 21:13.067
- WE'RE LUCKY
THEY'RE NOT ALL DEAD.

21:13.067 --> 21:14.567
- THE ONLY REASON SHE'S ALIVE
IS BECAUSE SHE'S INTUBATED.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.667
- WHO GOT THEM OUT OF THERE?
- O'MALLEY.

21:18.633 --> 21:20.767
- GEORGE.
- CALLIE, SHE WAS TOXIC.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.600
HER BLOOD WAS TOXIC.
IT'S NOT OUR MARRIAGE.

21:22.633 --> 21:24.633
- YOU THOUGHT
OUR MARRIAGE WAS TOXIC?

21:24.667 --> 21:26.533
- OKAY, ALL OUR PEOPLE
ARE BEING TREATED.

21:26.567 --> 21:31.367
NOW, WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT HER?

21:33.433 --> 21:35.167
- DR. GREY.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.667
YOUR HOLTER MONITOR SHOWS
YOU'RE HAVING MULTIPLE RUNS

21:37.700 --> 21:38.667
OF TACHYCARDIA EVERY HOUR.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.633
SO DR. BURKE WOULD LIKE
TO DO A RADIO ABLATION.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.067
- WHY WOULD HE RECOMMEND SURGERY

21:42.067 --> 21:45.400
WHEN MEDICATION CAN KEEP IT
UNDER CONTROL?

21:45.433 --> 21:48.167
BECAUSE ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS

21:48.200 --> 21:49.567
AREN'T ALWAYS COMPLIANT
WITH THEIR MEDS.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.833
- AND, APPARENTLY...

21:51.867 --> 21:55.167
MEREDITH SAYS YOU'RE
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT.

21:59.133 --> 22:01.133
- I COULD ELECT NOT TO TREAT IT
AT ALL.

22:01.167 --> 22:03.667
- YOUR STRESS TEST
SHOWS CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.100
THAT COUPLED
WITH THE TACHY ARRHYTHMIAS

22:05.133 --> 22:07.067
COULD CAUSE TOO MUCH STRESS
ON YOUR HEART,

22:07.067 --> 22:09.567
WHICH WOULD, EVENTUALLY...

22:14.433 --> 22:16.733
- WHAT WOULD YOU DO

22:16.767 --> 22:20.667
IF THE THING
THAT DEFINES WHO YOU ARE

22:20.700 --> 22:24.300
WAS TAKEN AWAY?

22:26.667 --> 22:30.667
TELL DR. BURKE...

22:30.700 --> 22:32.333
I DON'T WANT THE SURGERY.

22:32.367 --> 22:36.333
- I'M...I'M VERY SORRY,
DR. GREY.

22:36.367 --> 22:39.067
BUT TECHNICALLY,
THAT DECISION ISN'T YOURS.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.367
IT'S MEREDITH'S.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.667
- THIS IS A MAXI PAD,
HEAVY FLOW DAY.

22:44.700 --> 22:46.600
MINI PAD,
PRETTY SELF-EXPLANATORY.

22:46.633 --> 22:49.167
JUST PEEL THE LABEL
AND STICK IT.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.533
AND THE TAMPON,
WE'VE ALREADY GONE OVER, SO...

22:51.567 --> 22:52.567
ARE WE CLEAR ON EVERYTHING?

22:52.600 --> 22:57.300
KELLY, I UNDERSTAND

22:57.333 --> 22:58.400
THAT YOU'RE A LITTLE MORTIFIED
THAT YOUR DAD DRAGGED YOU

22:58.433 --> 23:01.600
IN HERE, BUT CAN YOU JUST TALK
OR NOD OR SOMETHING?

23:01.633 --> 23:03.067
- I GET IT, OKAY?

23:03.100 --> 23:04.067
- GREAT.

23:04.067 --> 23:05.700
- HOW'S IT GOING
WITH OUR VERY FIRST PATIENT?

23:05.733 --> 23:06.667
- KELLY'S A WOMAN.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.067
CAN I JUST GO TO THE GALLERY

23:08.067 --> 23:09.800
AND LEARN SOMETHING
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU?

23:09.833 --> 23:12.500
- GO AHEAD.

23:14.833 --> 23:17.500
UH, MR. HANSON, IF YOU COULD GO
TO THE FRONT DESK

23:17.533 --> 23:19.467
AND FILL OUT SOME PAPERWORK,
I CAN GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

23:19.500 --> 23:22.433
- OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
THANK YOU.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.300
SINCE MY WIFE DIED,

23:24.333 --> 23:27.467
I-I'VE BEEN IN THE WOODS
A LITTLE WITH KELLY.

23:32.767 --> 23:33.567
- ARE YOU OKAY, KELLY?

23:33.600 --> 23:35.633
ANY CRAMPS?
'CAUSE A HEATING PAD...

23:35.667 --> 23:36.767
- COULD I BE PREGNANT
IF I HAD SEX LAST WEEK,

23:36.800 --> 23:38.467
LIKE, BEFORE
THE PERIOD THING STARTED?

23:38.500 --> 23:41.500
'CAUSE I DID, AND IT WOULD
REALLY SUCK IF I WAS PREGNANT,

23:41.533 --> 23:42.400
'CAUSE NOW THE GUY'S BEING
A REAL JERK,

23:42.433 --> 23:45.067
AND HE'S TOTALLY IGNORING ME
AT SCHOOL.

23:45.067 --> 23:46.300
SO I REALLY HOPE
I CAN'T BE PREGNANT.

23:46.333 --> 23:48.500
I CAN'T, RIGHT?

23:52.267 --> 23:56.133
ANYWAY, YOU COULD, LIKE, ANSWER
ME BEFORE MY DAD GETS BACK.

23:56.167 --> 23:57.233
- I'M NOT SURE
REFUSING TREATMENT

23:57.267 --> 23:58.600
IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

23:58.633 --> 24:00.200
- APPARENTLY,
WHAT I WANT DOESN'T MATTER.

24:00.233 --> 24:02.600
IT ISN'T EVEN LEGALLY BINDING.

24:02.633 --> 24:03.800
SO IT'S REALLY
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT, MEREDITH.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.300
YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

24:05.333 --> 24:07.433
- DO YOU THINK I LIKE MAKING
THESE DECISIONS FOR YOU?

24:07.467 --> 24:10.333
DO YOU THINK IT'S FUN TO GET
CALLS FROM THE NURSING HOME,

24:10.367 --> 24:13.300
ASKING WHETHER I WAS PLANNING
ON GIVING THE NURSE,

24:13.333 --> 24:15.133
WHO CHANGES YOU EVERY MORNING,
A CHRISTMAS TIP?

24:15.167 --> 24:17.100
BUT I DO IT,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE MANAGED

24:17.133 --> 24:19.633
TO ALIENATE EVERYBODY ELSE
IN YOUR LIFE.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.500
AND I AM THE ONLY ONE,

24:22.533 --> 24:24.700
SO I HAVE TO STEP UP AND DO IT.

24:24.733 --> 24:28.833
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY I'M SO UNFOCUSED,

24:28.867 --> 24:31.433
SO ORDINARY?

24:31.467 --> 24:33.300
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

24:33.333 --> 24:35.333
YOU! YOU HAPPENED TO ME.

24:35.367 --> 24:36.300
- THEN LET ME REFUSE
THE HEART SURGERY.

24:36.333 --> 24:37.467
- NO!
- WHY NOT?

24:37.500 --> 24:39.767
- BECAUSE KILLING MY MOTHER

24:39.800 --> 24:42.133
IS NOT GONNA BE ANOTHER THING
THAT HAPPENS TO ME.

24:47.667 --> 24:48.733
- THESE SUITS ARE AIRTIGHT.

24:48.767 --> 24:51.400
- THESE PACKS WILL CIRCULATE
THE AIR TRAPPED INSIDE.

24:51.433 --> 24:52.667
- THESE BATTERIES
HAVEN'T BEEN CHARGING LONG.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.600
I'M GUESSING YOU GOT
ABOUT 30 MINUTES

24:54.633 --> 24:56.100
BEFORE THEY DIE
AND YOU HAVE TO COME OUT.

24:56.133 --> 24:57.267
- OH, MY GOD,
THE ANESTHESIA'S WEARING OFF.

24:57.300 --> 24:59.733
SHE'S WAKING UP.

24:59.767 --> 25:01.067
- 30 MINUTES STARTING NOW.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.067
- SHE'S FIGHTING INTUBATION.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.133
- WE GO INSIDE BEFORE
THESE SEALS ARE SECURE,

25:04.167 --> 25:06.567
WE WOULDN'T LAST FIVE MINUTES,
AND SHE WILL DIE.

25:06.600 --> 25:07.767
- THESE GUYS
ARE TWO MINUTES OUT.

25:07.800 --> 25:08.733
- SHE DOESN'T HAVE TWO MINUTES.

25:08.767 --> 25:11.167
- ADDISON!

25:20.633 --> 25:21.600
- GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

25:21.633 --> 25:22.700
- SHE'S AWAKE, MARK.

25:22.733 --> 25:23.600
SHE'S AWAKE
AND OPEN ON THE TABLE.

25:23.633 --> 25:25.367
I NEED TO KNOW HER WEIGHT,

25:25.400 --> 25:27.067
SO I CAN DOSE HER
WITH THE PROPOCAL.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.533
- SHE LOOKS ABOUT 60 KILOS.

25:29.567 --> 25:33.333
-IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE OKAY.

25:33.367 --> 25:35.467
IT'S OKAY. GOT IT.

25:41.200 --> 25:44.067
- I GOT YOU, I GOT YOU.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.367
- LOOKS LIKE SVT.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.633
- PUSH OF ADENOSINE
AND PAGE DR. BURKE.

25:57.667 --> 25:58.600
- HE'S ALREADY GONE
INTO SURGERY.

25:58.633 --> 26:00.267
I'LL GET THE ADENOSINE.

26:00.300 --> 26:03.300
- CAROTID MASSAGE.
DO THE CAROTID MASSAGE.

26:03.333 --> 26:06.167
- CAROTID MASSAGE CAN REGULATE
THE HEART AND STOP SVT.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.767
OKAY, HOLD ON.

26:07.800 --> 26:13.767
HOLD ON.

26:13.800 --> 26:16.433
HOLD ON, PLEASE.

26:16.467 --> 26:20.333
HOLD ON, HOLD ON. OKAY.

26:20.367 --> 26:24.233
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

26:37.500 --> 26:41.100
- YOU'RE GOOD.
SHARP UNDER PRESSURE.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.633
YOU'LL MAKE
AN EXTRAORDINARY SURGEON.

26:51.400 --> 26:54.700
- DR. GREY, I NEED TO ASK YOU.

26:54.733 --> 26:58.067
WILL IT GET IN MY WAY?

26:58.100 --> 27:01.600
CAN I HAVE BOTH? CAN I BE
A GREAT SURGEON AND HAVE A LIFE?

27:01.633 --> 27:03.567
BECAUSE THERE IS THIS MAN
WHO JUST ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM,

27:03.600 --> 27:05.300
AND I KNOW YOU TRIED
TO HAVE BOTH,

27:05.333 --> 27:08.167
BUT YOU SPLIT UP
WITH MEREDITH'S DAD AND...

27:08.200 --> 27:09.833
I KNOW
THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

27:09.867 --> 27:13.100
- IT IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

27:18.500 --> 27:19.767
AND I DIDN'T TRY HARD ENOUGH.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.300
- THANK YOU.

27:34.867 --> 27:38.167
- ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?

27:38.200 --> 27:39.833
- I WILL BE ONCE MY PATIENT
IS OFF THE TABLE.

27:39.867 --> 27:42.100
LOOK AT THESE TWO.

27:42.133 --> 27:43.500
A HEART SURGEON
AND A NEUROSURGEON

27:43.533 --> 27:45.833
PERFORMING A BOWEL RESECTION.

27:45.867 --> 27:48.267
YOU THINK THE WORLD STOPS
WHEN YOU STOP,

27:48.300 --> 27:51.300
BUT IT KEEPS ON GOING.

27:53.267 --> 27:55.700
PEOPLE PERFORM YOUR SURGERIES
BETTER THAN YOU COULD.

27:55.733 --> 27:58.133
THE NEXT GENERATION COMES UP,

27:58.167 --> 28:03.067
AND YOU'RE SCARED
YOU'LL BE FORGOTTEN.

28:03.100 --> 28:06.800
YOUR MOTHER STOPPED FOR FIVE
YEARS, AND YOU BECAME SOMEONE.

28:06.833 --> 28:10.400
- ACCORDING TO HER, I DIDN'T.

28:10.433 --> 28:13.567
ACCORDING TO HER,
I'M A DISAPPOINTMENT.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.267
- IN A PERFECT WORLD,
SHE'D BE ABLE

28:15.300 --> 28:16.767
TO TELL YOU
THAT SHE WAS PROUD OF YOU.

28:16.800 --> 28:20.300
BUT IT'S NOT A PERFECT WORLD.

28:20.333 --> 28:22.800
AND YOUR MOTHER'S
NOT A PERFECT WOMAN.

28:26.667 --> 28:30.700
- I THINK THE PERSON SHE'D MOST
LIKE TO SEE RIGHT NOW IS YOU.

28:35.400 --> 28:37.200
- THE ONLY THING YOUR MOTHER
WANTS TO HEAR RIGHT NOW

28:37.233 --> 28:38.500
IS THAT I REGRET STAYING
WITH ADELE.

28:38.533 --> 28:42.233
IT'S THE ONLY GIFT
I COULD GIVE HER.

28:42.267 --> 28:45.700
AND I CAN'T TELL HER THAT.

28:45.733 --> 28:47.733
IT'S NOT TRUE.

29:02.233 --> 29:04.233
- THEY WON'T FIT.

29:05.300 --> 29:07.633
- STOP RIGHT THERE.

29:07.667 --> 29:10.067
THE BOWEL SWELLED.
THEY WON'T FIT.

29:10.100 --> 29:12.667
HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE?
- EIGHT MINUTES.

29:12.700 --> 29:17.533
- OKAY, LISTEN TO ME,
AND DO EVERYTHING I SAY.

29:17.567 --> 29:19.400
- KELLY, YOUR PREGNANCY TEST
IS NEGATIVE,

29:19.433 --> 29:21.167
AND YOU'RE CLEAN FOR STDs.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.300
- OH, THANK GOD.
- GREAT.

29:22.333 --> 29:24.400
THANKS TO YOU, I'M ALSO GROUNDED
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

29:24.433 --> 29:25.367
- KELLY, BE POLITE.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.067
- I'M SORRY, SIR,

29:27.067 --> 29:30.700
BUT POLITE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE
GETTING YOU TWO VERY FAR.

29:30.733 --> 29:33.233
KELLY, YOUR DAD TOLD ME

29:33.267 --> 29:35.100
YOU LOST YOUR MOTHER
A FEW YEARS AGO,

29:35.133 --> 29:37.567
AND I WANT TO SAY
HOW SORRY I AM.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.700
YOU PROBABLY HAVE
A MILLION QUESTIONS,

29:39.733 --> 29:41.367
AND IF YOUR MOTHER WERE HERE,

29:41.400 --> 29:44.267
I'M SURE SHE WOULD HAVE MORE
ELOQUENT ANSWERS THAN I DO,

29:44.300 --> 29:47.133
BUT I THINK THAT SHE AND I WOULD
ACTUALLY BE SAYING

29:47.167 --> 29:49.167
THE SAME THING, WHICH IS,

29:49.200 --> 29:52.067
IF YOU KEEP GOING
THE WAY YOU'RE GOING,

29:52.100 --> 29:53.800
YOU WILL GET AN STD.

29:53.833 --> 29:56.533
YOU WILL GET PREGNANT.

29:56.567 --> 29:59.700
YOU WILL INCREASE YOUR CHANCES
OF GETTING CERVICAL CANCER.

29:59.733 --> 30:03.800
YOU'RE NOT BEING SMART,

30:03.833 --> 30:07.333
AND YOU'RE TOO YOUNG FOR ANYONE
TO EXPECT YOU TO BE SMART

30:07.367 --> 30:10.267
THE WAY YOU NEED TO BE
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING SEX,

30:10.300 --> 30:13.167
WHICH MEANS
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HAVING IT.

30:15.733 --> 30:17.367
- I THOUGHT HE LIKED ME.

30:17.400 --> 30:21.100
- OH, HONEY, I KNOW YOU DID.

30:23.167 --> 30:26.467
I KNOW YOU DID.

30:27.567 --> 30:30.267
- [sobbing]

30:38.467 --> 30:40.533
- OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA LIVE.
- CALLIE, WAIT.

30:40.567 --> 30:44.100
I WAS A LITTLE BIT HEROIC
IN THERE.

30:44.133 --> 30:45.733
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE PROUD OF ME.

30:45.767 --> 30:47.667
- PROUD? YOU WERE POISONED,
AND YOU THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT ME.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.433
- IT FELT
LIKE AN ANXIETY ATTACK.

30:49.467 --> 30:51.633
- ABOUT ME.

30:51.667 --> 30:53.433
YOU SEE, WE WERE FINE WHEN
WE WERE IN OUR VEGAS BUBBLE.

30:53.467 --> 30:56.200
WHEN IT WAS JUST ROOM SERVICE
AND PAY CABLE AND US,

30:56.233 --> 30:57.767
IT WAS BLISS, BUT THEN YOU GET
AROUND YOUR WEIRD

30:57.800 --> 30:58.800
AND JUDGY FRIENDS FOR ONE DAY,

30:58.833 --> 31:01.267
AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE WRACKED
WITH UNCERTAINTY,

31:01.300 --> 31:02.667
TOXIC-GAS-LEVEL UNCERTAINTY.

31:02.700 --> 31:05.067
I GUESS IT WAS TOO MUCH TO HOPE

31:05.067 --> 31:06.200
YOU'D JUST STAND UP FOR ME.
- CALLIE.

31:06.233 --> 31:09.567
- AND MY MIDDLE NAME
IS IPHIGENIA, OKAY?

31:09.600 --> 31:13.367
I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR WHAT YOUR
PALS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.833
- SO THAT WAS PRETTY COOL,
WHAT YOU JUST DID--

31:26.867 --> 31:29.133
GOING IN
AND PUTTING HER BACK UNDER.

31:29.167 --> 31:33.433
- COOL OR STUPID?
TAKE YOUR PICK.

31:37.300 --> 31:40.233
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, I GOT TO GO.

31:47.867 --> 31:49.300
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:49.333 --> 31:50.733
- CHIEF FIGURED OUT

31:50.767 --> 31:53.167
THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST DIDN'T HAVE
TIME TO DROP AN NG TUBE,

31:53.200 --> 31:55.533
SO NOW THEY HAVE TO PLACE ONE
AND DECOMPRESS

31:55.567 --> 31:57.500
AND REPACK HER INTESTINES
AND CLOSE.

31:57.533 --> 31:59.400
AND THEY'RE ABOUT TO RUN
OUT OF AIR.

31:59.433 --> 32:02.100
- HOLY CRAP.

32:02.133 --> 32:04.300
THIS SO BEATS TAMPON TRAINING.

32:04.333 --> 32:05.833
- PRESTON, YOU'LL NEED
TO MILK THE BOWEL

32:05.867 --> 32:07.067
TO GET OUT THE EXCESS FLUID.

32:07.067 --> 32:10.567
PACK HER AND WRAP HER AND GET
HER STABLE FOR TRANSPORT.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.800
- HOW'S GEORGE?
- MEDICALLY, HE'S FINE.

32:12.833 --> 32:14.667
EMOTIONALLY, HE'S A LITTLE
STUNTED IF YOU ASK ME.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.600
YOU DON'T MARRY
THE REBOUND GIRL, AM I RIGHT?

32:16.633 --> 32:18.367
- YOU DON'T MARRY ANYONE
ON A WHIM.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.067
- HE NEEDS OUR SUPPORT.

32:20.067 --> 32:22.367
- HE DOESN'T NEED US.
HE'S GOT HIS VEGAS SHOW WIFE.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.267
- OH.
- CHIEF, THEY'RE AT 32 MINUTES.

32:24.300 --> 32:25.400
YOU GOT TO TO PULL THEM OUT.

32:25.433 --> 32:27.300
- HOW YOU DOING ON AIR?

32:32.767 --> 32:35.767
- I'M OUT.
- YOU GO. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

32:35.800 --> 32:39.467
- ALONE? YOU CAN'T.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.567
[coughs]

32:45.867 --> 32:47.400
[gasping]

32:58.067 --> 33:00.067
- THAT'S NOT GOOD.

33:06.433 --> 33:07.300
- OKAY, DAMAGE CONTROL.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.700
WE STILL HAVE TO PACK HER
AND WRAP HER

33:09.733 --> 33:11.200
SO THAT SHE'S STABLE
FOR TRANSPORT.

33:11.233 --> 33:12.500
WE WORK IN SHIFTS.

33:12.533 --> 33:13.667
ONE DOCTOR AT A TIME.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.400
NO ONE STAYS IN
FOR MORE THAN 20 SECONDS.

33:15.433 --> 33:16.533
DR. SLOAN,
DO YOU WANT TO GO FIRST?

33:16.567 --> 33:17.767
- I'M NOT GOING IN THERE.

33:17.800 --> 33:20.267
- WHAT?

33:20.300 --> 33:21.333
- IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE

33:21.367 --> 33:22.667
FOR THE REMAINING
HEALTHY ATTENDING

33:22.700 --> 33:24.633
TO EXPOSE HIMSELF
TO THE NEUROTOXIN,

33:24.667 --> 33:27.167
A NEUROTOXIN
WHOSE LONG-TERM EFFECTS

33:27.200 --> 33:28.133
WE'RE STILL UNAWARE OF.

33:28.167 --> 33:31.067
SO I'M STAYING IN HERE.

33:33.300 --> 33:36.100
- I CAN SWIM THREE LENGTHS
OF MY PARENTS' POOL UNDERWATER.

33:36.133 --> 33:37.567
- YOU'RE UP, DR. YANG.

33:37.600 --> 33:40.600
LET'S GET HER MASKED.

33:40.633 --> 33:42.833
SLOAN, GIVE HER THE LAP PADS.

33:42.867 --> 33:45.367
YOU'RE GONNA WET THEM
AND PACK THE CAVITY.

33:48.200 --> 33:51.333
IF YOU FEEL FAINT, GET OUT.

33:53.100 --> 33:54.733
COME ON, YANG, HURRY.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.467
- I PACKED THE WOUND.
- DR. STEVENS.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.767
- I COULDN'T GET...
I COULDN'T WRAP IT.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.333
- REMOVE THE DRAPE AND SECURE
THE PLASTIC ALONG THE SIDES.

34:06.367 --> 34:09.200
IT'S GOT TO BE TIGHT.

34:18.267 --> 34:21.133
HURRY.
COME ON, STEVENS. COME ON.

34:27.467 --> 34:30.400
- I COULDN'T...
THE SEAL, IT TWISTED.

34:30.433 --> 34:33.333
- THE SEAL NEEDS TO BE AS CLOSE
TO VACUUM-TIGHT AS POSSIBLE.

34:33.367 --> 34:35.633
IT'LL INFLATE, AND THEN
YOU'LL KNOW IT'S SECURE.

34:43.667 --> 34:45.800
COME ON, GREY. COME ON.

34:56.167 --> 34:59.067
- SHE'S STILL TOXIC?

34:59.067 --> 35:00.300
- SHE'S ON CRRT.

35:00.333 --> 35:03.333
IT'S A TYPE OF DIALYSIS TO
REMOVE THE TOXIN FROM THE BLOOD.

35:03.367 --> 35:06.267
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO IN
IN A FEW HOURS.

35:20.200 --> 35:23.167
- YOU WOKE UP.
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.767
- I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD NEVER
HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

35:25.800 --> 35:29.767
I THOUGHT ALL THE BAD STUFF IN
MY LIFE WAS OVER WHEN I MET YOU.

35:29.800 --> 35:32.767
-IT IS...

35:32.800 --> 35:35.800
MARINA ROSE.

35:35.833 --> 35:37.400
- THAT'S MY NAME.

35:39.733 --> 35:42.333
- HEROIC WORK,
ALL OF YOU, HEROIC.

35:42.367 --> 35:45.500
DR. SLOAN, LET'S CHECK
ON OUR PATIENT.

35:49.633 --> 35:52.467
- HOW COME WE DO ALL THE WORK,
AND HE GETS ALL THE GLORY?

35:52.500 --> 35:53.567
- BECAUSE HE'S MARK.

36:00.767 --> 36:02.533
- I'M SORRY I LEFT.

36:02.567 --> 36:06.067
I...IT WAS...

36:06.100 --> 36:08.833
I GOT TO DO DAMAGE CONTROL
ON THE TOXIC WOMAN.

36:08.867 --> 36:11.767
- GOOD FOR YOU.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.667
- DID YOU EVER GET
ANY PATIENTS?

36:13.700 --> 36:16.600
- JUST THAT ONE.
- ONE.

36:16.633 --> 36:22.300
- $8 MILLION WORTH OF ONE.

36:22.333 --> 36:24.600
LOCK UP FOR ME.

36:36.833 --> 36:39.233
- I HEARD YOU WERE HAVING
SURGERY TOMORROW.

36:39.267 --> 36:42.367
- DO YOU...

36:44.567 --> 36:45.700
DO I KNOW WHO MEREDITH IS?

36:45.733 --> 36:48.367
DO I AT LEAST
RECOGNIZE MEREDITH?

36:48.400 --> 36:51.533
- YOU KNOW
SHE'S SOMEONE IMPORTANT,

36:51.567 --> 36:53.100
SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU.

36:53.133 --> 36:55.833
- YOU LOOK OUT FOR HER,

36:55.867 --> 36:57.633
BECAUSE SHE'S GOT
SO MUCH MORE TO LEARN,

36:57.667 --> 36:59.567
AND I WON'T BE ABLE
TO TEACH HER.

36:59.600 --> 37:00.800
- I'LL LOOK OUT FOR HER.

37:00.833 --> 37:03.567
- I WISH I COULD GO BACK.

37:05.367 --> 37:06.767
I'D DO EVERYTHING
SO DIFFERENTLY.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.433
I'D FIGHT HARDER FOR YOU.

37:09.467 --> 37:13.333
I THINK IF I'D FOUGHT HARDER
FOR YOU, MAYBE...

37:21.100 --> 37:24.600
- WE WOULD HAVE HAD A WONDERFUL
LIFE TOGETHER, ELLIS.

37:24.633 --> 37:26.067
- YOU THINK SO?

37:26.100 --> 37:27.467
- I DO.

37:27.500 --> 37:30.233
WE WOULD HAVE DONE
OUR FELLOWSHIP HERE.

37:30.267 --> 37:34.600
AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE FOUGHT
ME FOR CHIEF AND PROBABLY WON,

37:34.633 --> 37:38.367
AND I WOULDN'T HAVE MINDED

37:38.400 --> 37:40.167
BECAUSE WE'D HAVE KIDS AT HOME.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.067
- WE HAVE KIDS?

37:42.067 --> 37:47.067
- MEREDITH WOULD HAVE NEEDED
A BROTHER AND SISTER.

37:47.067 --> 37:50.433
KIDS NEED FAMILY.
- WE WOULD HAVE BEEN A FAMILY.

37:50.467 --> 37:52.667
- PROBABLY BOUGHT
THAT BIG HOUSE ON PARKER,

37:52.700 --> 37:54.200
THE ONE WITH THE BARN.

37:54.233 --> 37:58.200
THAT'S A GOOD PLACE
FOR A FAMILY.

37:58.233 --> 37:59.600
- AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY

37:59.633 --> 38:03.067
JUST LIKE MEREDITH SAYS
SHE'S HAPPY.

38:04.167 --> 38:06.600
AND THAT WOULD HAVE...

38:06.633 --> 38:09.833
CHANGED EVERYTHING.

38:09.867 --> 38:12.767
[voice breaking]
MAYBE...I WOULD BE FINE,

38:12.800 --> 38:15.800
AND WE COULD GROW OLD TOGETHER,

38:15.833 --> 38:20.633
AND LIFE WOULD BE
SO PERFECTLY ORDINARY.

38:20.667 --> 38:24.467
- YEAH.

38:31.767 --> 38:33.467
- MY LIFE IS SO UNFINISHED.

38:33.500 --> 38:36.533
IT'S UNFINISHED,
AND I'M NOT FINISHED.

38:38.467 --> 38:40.667
- NO, ELLIS.

38:40.700 --> 38:42.133
DON'T THINK THAT.

38:42.167 --> 38:48.333
JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND THINK OF THE FAMILY...

38:48.367 --> 38:49.767
OF THE HOUSE.

38:49.800 --> 38:53.067
- AND YOU THERE EVERY NIGHT
TO COME HOME TO.

38:55.767 --> 38:59.600
- AND ME THERE.

38:59.633 --> 39:04.333
I'M THERE.

39:08.267 --> 39:11.833
- I AM SUPER SCRUBBED.
I'M MINUS MY EPIDERMIS.

39:11.867 --> 39:13.633
- I STILL FEEL ALL FUMY.

39:13.667 --> 39:15.100
- OH, HEY.

39:15.133 --> 39:16.800
IT'S THE LITTLE WOMAN.

39:16.833 --> 39:18.567
SO WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS NOW?

39:18.600 --> 39:20.633
YOU'RE NOT MOVING IN, ARE YOU?

39:21.833 --> 39:25.367
- NICE.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.633
- WAIT, CALLIE.
- FORGET IT. JUST...

39:27.667 --> 39:30.200
- NO.
UNBELIEVABLE.

39:30.233 --> 39:32.333
YOU PEOPLE, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE MY FRIENDS,

39:32.367 --> 39:34.400
MY CLOSEST FRIENDS.

39:34.433 --> 39:36.433
CALLIE, SHE'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
PART OF MY LIFE NOW.

39:36.467 --> 39:38.100
IF YOU WANT TO DRIVE HER AWAY,

39:38.133 --> 39:40.533
AND YOUR MASTERS AT IT,
YOU'LL DO IT.

39:40.567 --> 39:41.567
BUT IF SHE'S GONE, I'M GONE.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.633
SHE'S MY WIFE.

39:43.667 --> 39:47.067
CALLIOPE IPHIGENIA TORRES
IS MY WIFE.

39:49.333 --> 39:50.533
- [laughs]

39:50.567 --> 39:52.367
- DON'T YOU DARE.
- OKAY.

39:55.100 --> 39:56.467
- AS DOCTORS, WE'RE TRAINED

39:56.500 --> 39:58.200
TO GIVE OUR PATIENTS
JUST THE FACTS.

39:58.233 --> 40:01.333
BUT WHAT OUR PATIENTS
REALLY WANT TO KNOW IS,

40:01.367 --> 40:03.100
WILL THE PAIN EVER GO AWAY?

40:03.133 --> 40:06.633
WILL I FEEL BETTER?
AM I CURED?

40:06.667 --> 40:09.033
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T THINK ABOUT ME.

40:09.067 --> 40:10.333
- I DON'T.

40:10.367 --> 40:14.400
I AM ACTIVELY NOT THINKING
ABOUT YOU

40:14.433 --> 40:18.333
RIGHT NOW.

40:18.367 --> 40:23.200
- WHAT OUR PATIENTS
REALLY WANT TO KNOW IS,

40:23.233 --> 40:25.167
IS THEIR HOPE?

40:28.700 --> 40:32.533
- I DON'T DO RINGS.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.800
DON'T EXPECT ME
TO SUDDENLY CHANGE.

40:42.833 --> 40:44.800
I'M A SURGEON JUST LIKE YOU.

40:44.833 --> 40:48.800
AND WE'LL HAVE MONEY.

40:52.733 --> 40:56.467
- ARE YOU SAYING YES?

40:56.500 --> 41:00.200
- YEAH.

41:00.233 --> 41:01.233
- I'M NOT LETTING YOU
SCRUB IN TOMORROW.

41:01.267 --> 41:02.133
- I'M NOT WEARING THE RING.

41:02.167 --> 41:04.167
- OKAY.
- OKAY, THEN.

41:04.200 --> 41:10.633
- YES! OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!
- [laughing]

41:10.667 --> 41:12.700
- BUT INEVITABLY THERE ARE TIMES

41:12.733 --> 41:17.067
WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF
IN THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO.

41:17.100 --> 41:21.700
- MEREDITH...
- I JUST HAVE TO SAY THIS.

41:21.733 --> 41:25.267
THE REASON I WANT YOU
TO HAVE THE SURGERY

41:25.300 --> 41:30.067
IS BECAUSE I HAVE THIS HOPE THAT
IN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS OR FIVE,

41:30.067 --> 41:31.833
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE
A BREAKTHROUGH.

41:31.867 --> 41:34.733
THEY'RE GONNA FIND
A CURE FOR ALZHEIMER'S,

41:34.767 --> 41:37.433
AND YOU AND I WILL HAVE
ANOTHER CHANCE

41:37.467 --> 41:38.533
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

41:38.567 --> 41:42.400
YOU'LL HAVE A CHANCE
TO GET TO KNOW ME,

41:42.433 --> 41:49.067
TO SEE THAT I AM NOT EVEN
REMOTELY ORDINARY.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.700
SO I WISH
YOU WOULD HAVE THE SURGERY,

41:51.733 --> 41:54.633
BUT IT'S UP TO YOU, MOM.

41:54.667 --> 41:58.667
IT'S YOUR LIFE.

42:04.767 --> 42:06.800
- YOU REMIND ME OF MY DAUGHTER.

42:13.100 --> 42:15.067
- ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

42:15.100 --> 42:19.067
ONE MINUTE SHE WAS HERE,
THE NEXT...

42:19.067 --> 42:20.767
I'M SO SORRY.

42:23.133 --> 42:24.800
- ME TOO.

42:28.500 --> 42:31.567
WHEN THE PATIENT'S BODY
HAS BETRAYED THEM

42:31.600 --> 42:35.833
AND ALL THE SCIENCE WE HAVE
TO OFFER HAS FAILED THEM,

42:35.867 --> 42:38.267
WHEN THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO
COMES TRUE,

42:38.300 --> 42:41.800
CLINGING TO HOPE
IS ALL WE'VE GOT LEFT.
