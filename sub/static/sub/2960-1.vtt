00:39.518 --> 00:42.672
Oh, God. Oh, God.

00:42.772 --> 00:45.803
Oh, God. Did you come?

00:46.275 --> 00:48.645
Oh, God.

00:49.245 --> 00:51.529
Oh, God.

00:54.650 --> 00:57.730
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

00:58.721 --> 01:03.025
I just always want to feel so close
to you but I'm really not.

01:03.793 --> 01:06.746
Like you love me and...

01:07.663 --> 01:10.300
like you're listening to me...

01:11.501 --> 01:14.906
and listening to my bo... my body.

01:19.175 --> 01:23.279
I feel like I'm hurting you,
but you're just letting me hurt you,

01:23.379 --> 01:27.991
and it's so so sweet! It's so nice!

01:28.618 --> 01:31.794
I don't want to hurt you, though.

01:33.623 --> 01:37.461
- I mean, I also do, you know?
- Yeah, I know.

01:40.929 --> 01:43.009
<i>I pray for sound...</i>

01:44.267 --> 01:47.503
<i>Ever feel like you're staring
at the life you want...</i>

01:47.603 --> 01:50.740
<i>but from too far away
to actually live it,</i>

01:50.840 --> 01:54.077
<i>like you're the plagiarized
version of yourself?</i>

01:54.177 --> 01:57.013
<i>My parents died too early
for me to know them.</i>

01:57.113 --> 02:00.817
<i>It's not as tragic as it sounds.
I was fine.</i>

02:00.917 --> 02:03.797
<i>I am... fine.</i>

02:04.754 --> 02:06.255
Why did that war have no heroes?

02:06.355 --> 02:09.243
Because we were too wild
and jovial to know the brutal...

02:09.342 --> 02:12.562
- <i>That is my fiancÃ©, Garret Brener.</i>
- ...truths of the fight.

02:12.662 --> 02:16.032
<i>He is an actor. He is really good.</i>

02:16.132 --> 02:18.534
<i>He told me himself.</i>

02:18.634 --> 02:21.070
<i>I work here, Abundant Records,</i>

02:21.170 --> 02:23.673
<i>where every song sounds better
with a beat.</i>

02:23.773 --> 02:26.959
<i>If you're signed here,
you have a real shot at making it,</i>

02:27.059 --> 02:31.697
<i>a shot at being her, Jody Sinclair.</i>

02:31.747 --> 02:36.816
<i>My best friend Ryan is the PR brains
behind the highly grossing Jody brand.</i>

02:36.916 --> 02:40.924
<i>She got me this gig to get my foot
in the proverbial music door.</i>

02:41.023 --> 02:43.959
<i>She knows how to handle talent.</i>

02:44.293 --> 02:46.963
<i>And this is me, Catherine Brown.</i>

02:47.063 --> 02:49.932
<i>The real me is a songwriter.</i>

02:50.032 --> 02:52.702
<i>The real me is signed
at Abundant Records.</i>

02:52.802 --> 02:56.239
<i>The real me wouldn't be planning a wedding
because she hates weddings,</i>

02:56.339 --> 03:00.403
<i>and anyone who takes them seriously
is a ridiculous person,</i>

03:00.503 --> 03:05.114
<i>but this me, the me that is
actually living my life...</i>

03:05.214 --> 03:06.793
Oh, no, it's so good.

03:08.951 --> 03:10.486
<i>This me is stuck...</i>

03:10.586 --> 03:14.358
<i>stuck at home, stuck at work...</i>

03:14.824 --> 03:17.804
<i>and stuck with this damn song.</i>

03:19.562 --> 03:22.205
<i>Oh, yeah. Lately, I've been doing that.</i>

03:24.834 --> 03:28.271
<i>I don't really know why.
I think it makes me feel better.</i>

03:28.321 --> 03:30.629
<i>Hey, at least I'm not a cutter.</i>

03:52.194 --> 03:53.980
Oh, shit!

03:54.080 --> 03:59.302
Garrett, I am late, And I molested
that little marble man for a full minute.

03:59.702 --> 04:02.858
That marble man is a De Fontana.
It's worth a fortune.

04:02.958 --> 04:05.324
Oh, God, my eyes are so blue.

04:05.374 --> 04:07.558
You want to do lunch at noon?

04:09.345 --> 04:13.416
My eyes... No, I can't. I can't today.

04:13.516 --> 04:17.253
- Sorry, babe, therapist.
- On a Monday?

04:18.553 --> 04:21.141
Twice a week, digging deep.

04:27.897 --> 04:31.447
- Have a good morning, Pete.
- Thank you, Cath. You're the best.

04:36.739 --> 04:40.543
- Alex Calucas wants to see you upstairs.
- Thanks, Sally.

04:40.643 --> 04:44.380
Turner, hey... Turner, do you know
why they want to see me upstairs?

04:44.480 --> 04:47.353
- No, no clue.
- Well, how was the shoot?

04:47.453 --> 04:50.797
- Flipped her shit.
- And then she threw a muffin at Ryan.

04:50.897 --> 04:54.302
What the hell? What a crazy ass.

04:55.391 --> 04:56.859
And you know how I feel about carbs.

04:56.959 --> 05:02.265
Okay, she is only in town
for two more days, just... breathe.

05:02.365 --> 05:05.068
- The little bitch doesn't even sing...
- Well, yeah, she spins.

05:05.168 --> 05:08.656
- Picks a song and presses play.
- And that wins you a Grammy?

05:08.756 --> 05:13.643
What can you do? People are into
post-Internet scene kids and robot dubstep.

05:13.743 --> 05:17.109
- Why does Alex want to see me upstairs?
- Maybe they finally listened to your demo.

05:17.209 --> 05:18.848
- Right.
- Makin' big money.

05:18.948 --> 05:20.455
Absolutely.

05:20.555 --> 05:22.735
- Caitlin!
- Catherine.

05:22.835 --> 05:25.354
Catherine, come on in. Come on in.

05:25.454 --> 05:27.356
Please, have a seat.

05:27.456 --> 05:31.160
- We have some exciting news for you.
- Important and exciting.

05:31.545 --> 05:33.600
You are about to win at life.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.946
- You're gonna be a life winner.
- Listen...

05:37.533 --> 05:42.071
we would like for you
to shadow Jody Sinclair.

05:42.171 --> 05:44.573
- You're gonna be her new wrangler.
- Wrangler.

05:44.673 --> 05:46.838
- Are you excited?
- You excited?

05:46.938 --> 05:48.406
- Yeah!
- I told you.

05:48.506 --> 05:49.812
- Great.
- See, I love her.

05:49.912 --> 05:51.714
- Great.
- All right, thank you.

05:51.814 --> 05:53.727
Okay, bye-bye.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.242
Sorry...

06:08.342 --> 06:09.939
what do you mean by wrangle?

06:10.149 --> 06:12.565
I can't go out there.

06:13.001 --> 06:14.987
One minute.

06:15.504 --> 06:16.972
Do you want to talk about it?

06:17.072 --> 06:22.544
How can we talk about the pain
that's in the world right now?

06:22.644 --> 06:25.448
You know, like, it's just so much.

06:25.548 --> 06:29.249
Sometimes you just don't know what to do,
and when there's that much pain,

06:29.349 --> 06:34.457
it really gives no meaning
to me spinning my amazing records.

06:34.557 --> 06:36.258
- Yeah.
- And I'm really good.

06:36.358 --> 06:39.795
- And I wish I could help them.
- Let me help you out.

06:39.895 --> 06:42.131
Here we go. It's gonna be okay.

06:42.231 --> 06:43.299
- No...
- Yeah, well...

06:43.399 --> 06:45.934
- I don't want to go.
- Oh, you're not going, okay.

06:46.004 --> 06:48.803
I'm gonna get you on the floor then.

06:49.822 --> 06:52.341
Let's just get on the stage
and then we can keep...

06:52.441 --> 06:54.343
- Drag me... drag me gently.
- Okay.

06:54.443 --> 06:57.746
- This is a vintage McQueen.
- I'm sorry if it's gonna get torn.

06:57.846 --> 07:00.487
I don't really want to mess up
your clothes.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.798
- This is... kind of romantic.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

07:22.604 --> 07:26.476
<i>My dad produced that album
and my mother sang some of the vocals.</i>

07:27.276 --> 07:29.991
<i>I walk by this store front every day,</i>

07:30.091 --> 07:33.349
<i>and I think about that drive
and that Woodstock house,</i>

07:33.449 --> 07:36.231
<i>and the box
with my mom's wedding dress...</i>

07:37.753 --> 07:42.742
<i>and my dad's lucky quill that I buried
under the fourth tree from the porch.</i>

07:50.833 --> 07:53.085
Can you believe this?

07:56.205 --> 07:58.191
Thank you.

07:59.274 --> 08:00.976
- Catherine.
- Sally.

08:01.076 --> 08:04.380
- They want to see you upstairs again.
- Oh, probably getting a bonus.

08:04.780 --> 08:07.483
- Fired?
- We never said to physically assault her.

08:07.583 --> 08:11.287
- Yeah, "wrangle" wasn't literal.
- I was pulling, not assaulting, pulling.

08:11.387 --> 08:14.590
Pulling, assaulting, who knows
the difference? She felt violated.

08:14.690 --> 08:19.695
- She said it was either you or her.
- Yeah, and we chose her, obviously.

08:19.795 --> 08:22.231
Wait, I got her there
just like you said.

08:22.331 --> 08:26.001
Your actions jeopardized
the biggest client we have at this label.

08:26.101 --> 08:28.837
Your bad decisions almost
made me almost fire Ron.

08:28.937 --> 08:30.577
What?

08:31.006 --> 08:34.018
It's clear-your-desk time, Catherine.

08:39.448 --> 08:41.966
I want to thank you for this opportunity
and let you know

08:42.066 --> 08:45.087
that I have a bruise on my hip
because of last night's assignment,

08:45.187 --> 08:48.469
and I was the one assaulted,
and I was the one abused,

08:48.569 --> 08:51.026
but I will be fine,
because that is just what I do

08:51.126 --> 08:54.096
when things are not... fine.

08:54.196 --> 08:56.719
I just... I...

08:57.437 --> 08:59.662
make them fine.

09:10.412 --> 09:13.346
Were you... were you really
going to fire me? No.

09:13.446 --> 09:14.421
Yeah.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.104
Garret?

10:07.336 --> 10:10.305
- Hey.
- Catherine...

10:10.905 --> 10:12.953
Bonjour.

10:13.053 --> 10:15.344
Bonjour? Wh..

10:15.444 --> 10:17.560
- This is... this is not what it looks like.
- Yeah?

10:17.660 --> 10:20.693
I know it looks really bad,
and it's a version of what it looks like,

10:20.793 --> 10:22.983
but it's not this.
It's much more innocent than...

10:23.083 --> 10:29.024
Therapist, Garret? I should have known
that "digging deep" was literal.

10:29.124 --> 10:31.694
This is Sylvia.
She's my... she's my dialect coach.

10:31.794 --> 10:34.977
And she... she was helping me
with some vowel sounds

10:35.077 --> 10:37.359
- the director said that I needed help on.
- Vowel sounds?

10:37.459 --> 10:39.990
Okay, Catherine,
just listen to me for one second.

10:40.090 --> 10:42.037
She showed me a scar
that she has on her leg

10:42.137 --> 10:44.243
from a horseback riding accident
when she was five,

10:44.323 --> 10:46.805
and she said it makes her feel ugly,
and so all I was trying to do

10:46.905 --> 10:50.412
is convince this broken girl
that she was okay.

10:50.512 --> 10:53.200
What am I supposed to do?
Anyway, the point is...

10:53.300 --> 10:56.388
I don't know how I got here. I really
don't know I got here. Why are you here?

10:56.488 --> 10:58.261
Why aren't you at work?

10:58.361 --> 11:00.022
I...

11:00.122 --> 11:01.490
was...

11:01.590 --> 11:03.301
fired!

11:05.059 --> 11:08.173
God! Oh, she got me right...

11:10.332 --> 11:13.409
<i>Baby, when you touch me</i>

11:15.370 --> 11:17.673
<i>I lose all sense of time</i>

11:17.773 --> 11:20.255
<i>Is he dead, is it love?</i>

11:20.355 --> 11:24.420
<i>Taste your lips upon me, girl</i>

11:25.781 --> 11:28.963
<i>Feel your skin next to mi...</i>

11:34.256 --> 11:37.655
<i>Really, this song is about...</i>

11:37.755 --> 11:40.295
<i>it's about this... the monster</i>

11:40.395 --> 11:43.131
<i>that was living under my bed as a child.</i>

11:43.231 --> 11:46.184
- <i>You're joking.</i>
- <i>No, I'm not... I'm not joking.</i>

11:46.284 --> 11:49.405
- What?
- <i>He was my mate, but I also feared him.</i>

11:49.505 --> 11:51.137
<i>This song is like a love song,</i>

11:51.237 --> 11:55.210
<i>but, like, also like a dream
of somebody in a mental institution.</i>

11:55.310 --> 11:57.576
Is anybody watching this disaster?

11:57.676 --> 12:01.169
- <i>What would you like to say to your fans?</i>
- <i>I don't really like to call them my fans.</i>

12:01.269 --> 12:04.186
- <i>I want to call them my friends.</i>
- I hate you.

12:04.286 --> 12:07.957
- <i>We're all one but I would die without them.</i>
- You should be dead.

12:08.057 --> 12:10.826
<i>Yeah, it's ironic, you know,
that's why I do what I do.</i>

12:10.926 --> 12:12.661
- Cath?
- Yo.

12:12.761 --> 12:15.897
<i>I'm not... I'm not just a deejay.</i>

12:16.550 --> 12:20.435
- <i>I'm a rhythm poet.</i>
- Hey! No, I was watching that.

12:20.535 --> 12:24.466
You look crazy, right now.
You are a crazy lady.

12:24.566 --> 12:28.683
That's it. One week is enough time
to mope around. Up we go.

12:28.783 --> 12:31.113
- No.
- We're going out, yes. Come.

12:31.213 --> 12:33.632
Dr. Phil said I'm a codependent.

12:33.882 --> 12:37.686
Okay, first of all,
never trust a bald man.

12:37.786 --> 12:39.209
I learned that the hard way,

12:39.309 --> 12:42.925
and second of all, psychology is like
the horoscope. We're going out.

12:43.025 --> 12:47.228
I am never going near
a man again, not even a...

12:47.284 --> 12:49.999
I will not be a codependent astrologer!

12:50.099 --> 12:53.351
That's fine. Okay, now wash your face.

12:53.451 --> 12:54.510
Fine!

12:56.375 --> 12:59.900
Oh, my God. You are so fun.

13:00.309 --> 13:06.481
Garret, he was not fun. He was one of those
artistic types... super needy and blah.

13:07.197 --> 13:09.451
- Who's Garret?
- I don't know.

13:09.551 --> 13:11.453
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:11.553 --> 13:13.122
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:13.522 --> 13:15.858
- I'm Ryan.
- This is Ryan.

13:15.958 --> 13:18.205
It's nice to meet you.

13:18.627 --> 13:21.617
- Yeah, we have to go, like, right now.
- Why? No, I'm having fun.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.273
Hi.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.754
It's good to see that you're alive.

13:29.304 --> 13:31.130
What's up?

13:31.230 --> 13:34.409
- Not much. Hello, Ryan.
- Don't speak to us.

13:34.489 --> 13:36.495
I'm gonna make an effort to be nice.

13:36.545 --> 13:40.489
Oh, you know what, Garret, I'm actually
really happy that you're here

13:40.539 --> 13:43.669
because I wanted to introduce you
to my new man, Dylan.

13:43.719 --> 13:44.787
- New man?
- What?

13:44.887 --> 13:49.042
Dylan, Garret, Garret, Dylan.
It's... we can all just...

13:50.175 --> 13:51.744
- Are you crazy?
- What the hell, man?

13:51.844 --> 13:54.980
- Are you crazy?
- What are you doing? I was lying, you animal.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.502
- I was trying to make you...
- Why would you lie to me?

13:57.602 --> 14:00.338
You should not lie to people.
Look what you made me do.

14:00.438 --> 14:03.521
- You're an asshole. You need some ice.
- Ryan, real mature.

14:03.621 --> 14:06.692
- Oh, God.
- What?

14:07.909 --> 14:09.659
You know what? I think you're right.

14:09.759 --> 14:13.744
I think maybe we should have some
time apart. I can't do this right now.

14:13.844 --> 14:16.896
This is crazy.
I can't have this kind of press.

14:16.996 --> 14:20.305
- I'm punching people.
- Yeah...

14:30.165 --> 14:32.517
Look who's got it together.

14:35.971 --> 14:37.964
I'm moving to Woodstock.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.577
What?

14:41.977 --> 14:45.881
This is the house I grew up in and this
whole time, I forgot I had this option.

14:45.981 --> 14:50.069
I mean, I haven't been there in 20 years,
but I do technically own this place.

14:50.385 --> 14:53.163
- Is this about last night?
- No.

14:53.722 --> 14:56.111
And what are you gonna do there alone?

14:56.211 --> 14:57.559
Write music...

14:57.659 --> 15:02.145
and do crafts, which I love.

15:02.831 --> 15:05.433
You're moving to Woodstock by yourself

15:05.533 --> 15:07.479
to a house you haven't seen
since you were four,

15:07.579 --> 15:11.056
with no one there that you know
so you could write and do crafts.

15:11.206 --> 15:12.855
Yes.

15:17.712 --> 15:19.414
What?

15:19.514 --> 15:21.450
- This is a horrible idea.
- Hey...

15:21.550 --> 15:24.229
Last night was supposed to be
about you getting out of the house,

15:24.329 --> 15:27.756
getting some fresh air because you spent
a whole week on that damn couch,

15:27.856 --> 15:31.108
and you looked like this tiny,
little Prozac commercial all curled up.

15:32.561 --> 15:34.663
And we know this about you.

15:34.763 --> 15:38.709
- You run from things.
- I am not running away from anything.

15:39.668 --> 15:44.384
I'm running to something.
And I have laundry.

16:03.825 --> 16:08.397
So my dad called this morning, asked me
if I wanted to meet Shelly again.

16:08.497 --> 16:10.966
Said it's important.
He said it's mature.

16:11.066 --> 16:13.683
He said that she means
everything to him...

16:15.403 --> 16:18.707
and we wonder why I sleep
around so much?

16:18.807 --> 16:22.337
We know this about him, okay? He doesn't
know how to protect your feelings.

16:22.437 --> 16:24.892
You just have to do it yourself.

16:26.548 --> 16:30.569
- You're gonna be fine.
- I'm gonna be... super fine.

16:32.654 --> 16:34.565
Come here.

16:38.193 --> 16:41.212
Let's pawn this bitch and get me a car.

16:42.063 --> 16:45.701
<i>Woodstock, New York, is exactly
one hour, 55 minutes from the city.</i>

16:46.101 --> 16:49.403
<i>You take the George Washington Bridge
over the Palisades Parkway,</i>

16:49.503 --> 16:51.439
<i>then west on route 28,</i>

16:52.125 --> 16:54.751
<i>and right onto route 33...</i>

16:55.877 --> 16:57.895
<i>and you're there.</i>

16:58.847 --> 17:03.652
<i>In Woodstock, you can plant
a daisy and out pops a rose.</i>

17:03.752 --> 17:06.262
<i>Even the soil here is creative.</i>

17:06.320 --> 17:09.361
<i>Historically, a town full of legends,</i>

17:09.461 --> 17:15.113
<i>all these romantic nomad people
who were always drawn to this one town,</i>

17:15.213 --> 17:19.256
<i>this beautiful,
creative spot, this Mecca,</i>

17:19.356 --> 17:22.304
<i>and I was going back there
to be an artist,</i>

17:22.404 --> 17:25.540
<i>to become the singer
I'd always hoped to be.</i>

17:25.640 --> 17:30.625
<i>Back to this rich, powerful,
creative Mecca.</i>

17:50.699 --> 17:52.744
Very good, thank you.

18:02.244 --> 18:05.329
Hi. A white wine, please.

18:09.150 --> 18:10.797
Vodka?

18:16.758 --> 18:18.669
Thank you.

18:23.965 --> 18:25.381
Another.

18:28.036 --> 18:29.788
Okay.

18:35.009 --> 18:37.779
Okay, thank you. One more, please.

18:37.879 --> 18:41.332
- Seriously?
- Yeah, seriously, and a beer.

18:44.786 --> 18:47.132
You know, I should be...

18:49.040 --> 18:51.349
I should be feeling good right now.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.975
I'm, like, good after this, right?

18:58.733 --> 19:01.053
<i>We are young</i>

19:02.237 --> 19:06.318
<i>Heartache to heartache, we stand</i>

19:07.575 --> 19:11.663
<i>No promises, no demands</i>

19:12.881 --> 19:15.113
<i>Love is a battlefield</i>

19:19.954 --> 19:22.268
<i>We are strong</i>

19:23.692 --> 19:28.226
<i>No one can tell us we're wrong</i>

19:28.997 --> 19:33.436
<i>Searching our hearts for some love</i>

19:34.486 --> 19:37.170
<i>Both of us knowing</i>

19:39.808 --> 19:43.405
<i>Love is a battlefield</i>

19:53.121 --> 19:55.235
Got to give her credit.

20:04.332 --> 20:06.485
Hey, you didn't pay!

20:06.968 --> 20:09.379
Emily, I got her, okay?

20:18.179 --> 20:19.948
Hey.

20:20.048 --> 20:21.417
Hi.

20:21.917 --> 20:23.588
I lost my stud.

20:25.653 --> 20:29.398
I can't find it,
and Garret gave me those.

20:29.658 --> 20:30.937
Look.

20:34.128 --> 20:35.977
Here it is.

20:36.077 --> 20:40.176
That's so... how did you find that?

20:40.735 --> 20:45.519
That is so... it's the tiniest thing
that's ever existed. You've got to have...

20:45.540 --> 20:48.923
you've got to have binoculars
for eyeballs.

20:51.713 --> 20:55.750
I'm sorry. I don't normally karaoke.

20:55.761 --> 20:58.753
I just got lost in the song.

20:58.853 --> 21:00.700
You were...

21:02.590 --> 21:04.310
fine.

21:06.561 --> 21:09.598
I can't believe that you found that.

21:09.698 --> 21:11.733
Oh, the light just hit it perfectly.

21:12.833 --> 21:14.869
It lit up at me.

21:21.609 --> 21:23.245
- I'm a professional.
- Oh, yeah?

21:23.345 --> 21:25.103
Yeah.

21:40.428 --> 21:42.269
Some things are hard to ignore.

21:44.132 --> 21:46.153
I love you.

21:56.111 --> 21:57.768
God.

22:00.448 --> 22:02.595
I got to stand up.

22:02.650 --> 22:04.865
Is everything moving?

22:06.257 --> 22:08.675
Hey, are you okay?

22:13.461 --> 22:16.364
Woodstock Clinic, Susie speaking.

22:16.564 --> 22:18.735
Oh, hi, Mrs. Colson.

22:25.406 --> 22:27.292
What?

22:29.177 --> 22:31.525
Do you know where Catherine Brown is?

22:35.332 --> 22:38.736
So this is your version of super fine?

22:38.836 --> 22:41.472
- Really?
- What happened?

22:41.522 --> 22:43.207
I don't know.

22:43.307 --> 22:46.583
You tell me.
I was the last person on your call list.

22:49.197 --> 22:52.063
The last thing I remember
was losing my earring.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.129
I guess I found it.

22:55.770 --> 23:00.519
Catherine, I see you're awake.
How you feeling?

23:03.178 --> 23:06.751
I'll take the silence
and blinking as "better."

23:06.851 --> 23:08.650
Any shortness of breath?

23:08.750 --> 23:11.152
Headache, nausea?

23:11.252 --> 23:13.762
No and no.

23:14.022 --> 23:17.942
All right, well,
this has been a great talk.

23:18.826 --> 23:22.211
Try to stay hydrated.
Call if you need anything.

23:23.331 --> 23:24.633
What have you got?

23:24.733 --> 23:27.742
Oh, my God. No.

23:27.835 --> 23:32.253
- You cannot like him.
- No, I know him.

23:32.344 --> 23:33.842
Oh, God.

23:33.942 --> 23:35.510
Oh, no.

23:35.610 --> 23:39.254
Home, home, please get me home.

23:48.323 --> 23:50.558
What do I do?

23:50.658 --> 23:54.708
Well, got a weekend and a credit card.

23:58.266 --> 24:00.512
<i>Yeah</i>

24:02.337 --> 24:04.621
<i>Send in the cavalry</i>

24:12.580 --> 24:15.884
<i>Travel round the world
and I've searching for a place</i>

24:15.984 --> 24:18.336
<i>With something new</i>

24:18.820 --> 24:21.890
<i>You only get one shot</i>

24:21.990 --> 24:26.060
<i>You've got to give it everything you got</i>

24:26.160 --> 24:29.751
<i>You've come a long way, baby
When I will fall</i>

24:29.849 --> 24:32.066
<i>You catch me when I go</i>

24:32.166 --> 24:36.588
<i>You're much closer than you know...</i>

24:37.738 --> 24:39.674
We're such good dancers.

24:39.774 --> 24:43.044
Books on friendship should be written
about people like you.

24:43.578 --> 24:45.817
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

24:45.917 --> 24:47.158
Okay.

24:52.987 --> 24:54.522
Hey, Cat!

24:54.622 --> 24:57.870
You came here to write,
so just start writing.

26:14.669 --> 26:17.446
Are you artichoking?
'Cause there's a doctor in the house.

26:18.306 --> 26:20.442
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:20.742 --> 26:22.402
You.

26:22.502 --> 26:24.278
Doctor.

26:24.378 --> 26:26.581
- I don't love you.
- What?

26:28.905 --> 26:31.586
I said that at the bar,
and I don't... I didn't mean it.

26:31.686 --> 26:35.957
I don't say things like that, and I don't
dance like that. I never dance like that.

26:36.057 --> 26:41.814
So I'm sorry for the awkward
"I love you," yeah.

26:43.798 --> 26:48.282
And I got to go to this thing that I have.
So I'm gonna go to this thing.

26:48.736 --> 26:50.104
Okay.

26:50.204 --> 26:52.320
Catherine, wait up.

26:55.643 --> 26:57.911
Go to dinner with me?

26:58.613 --> 27:00.125
Like on a date?

27:00.225 --> 27:02.717
- Yeah.
- Are you insane?

27:02.817 --> 27:05.361
Because I'm acting like...

27:05.461 --> 27:08.260
Never mind. Just... Look, Doctor...

27:08.360 --> 27:11.493
Please call me Noah. I... technically
would never ask a patient out

27:11.593 --> 27:15.947
so every time you call me "doctor,"
I can't help but feel a little pervy.

27:16.864 --> 27:21.552
Okay, Noah, I'm on a little thing
called the rebound.

27:21.652 --> 27:23.721
- I'll tie you up if you're into that.
- What?

27:23.821 --> 27:25.645
What?

27:27.241 --> 27:30.645
I'm sorry, that was bad... bad joke.

27:31.185 --> 27:32.995
Yeah.

27:33.614 --> 27:37.055
All right, I'm gonna go. Okay.

27:37.255 --> 27:39.014
Catherine!

27:49.964 --> 27:52.546
It was really great talking to you.

27:58.305 --> 28:00.084
You too.

28:53.727 --> 28:54.864
Focus.

29:15.315 --> 29:18.352
Hi, could I get a large coffee
with some ice in it, please?

29:18.452 --> 29:19.670
You mean, an ice coffee?

29:19.770 --> 29:23.952
No, like a hot coffee
but just with ice in it.

29:24.609 --> 29:26.711
I just like to drink it right away.

29:26.811 --> 29:28.453
$2.

29:35.402 --> 29:37.051
Thanks.

29:38.723 --> 29:40.958
Hey, you're the bartender
from the other night, right?

29:41.058 --> 29:44.395
- Yep.
- Yeah, I think I owe you money.

29:44.495 --> 29:46.779
Noah took care of it.

29:51.302 --> 29:54.205
- So when's the next show?
- Most weekends.

29:54.305 --> 29:56.557
But Lee Ann doesn't play here anymore.

29:56.641 --> 30:00.795
- Why not?
- Well, she doesn't perform anymore.

30:06.246 --> 30:08.728
Sorry. That's yours.

30:19.083 --> 30:23.137
Last time I'm scraping this off, Emily.
I'm warning you.

30:23.237 --> 30:25.072
Find another window.

30:25.122 --> 30:28.402
I've no idea what you're
talking about, Mr. Harmon.

30:34.265 --> 30:36.508
I'd put that on my wall.

30:37.435 --> 30:42.423
It's really good. Whoever did that
is, like, brilliant good.

30:47.478 --> 30:49.620
You should come to the barn
tomorrow night.

30:49.714 --> 30:53.235
Just up the creek about
a half-mile down from the race track.

30:54.485 --> 30:56.851
Everybody's gonna be at the farm.

30:57.921 --> 31:00.291
Aaron Embry's playing.

31:00.391 --> 31:02.238
Bye, Mr. Harmon.

31:24.615 --> 31:25.967
Hey.

31:30.955 --> 31:32.723
Hi.

31:32.893 --> 31:34.959
This place is amazing.

31:35.359 --> 31:37.361
It's starting.

31:37.911 --> 31:41.382
<i>Every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

31:41.482 --> 31:44.969
<i>Every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

31:45.069 --> 31:48.639
<i>Every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

31:48.739 --> 31:52.160
<i>Every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

31:52.260 --> 31:55.746
<i>Every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

31:55.846 --> 31:59.383
<i>Every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

31:59.433 --> 32:03.954
<i>Every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

32:22.239 --> 32:25.509
<i>If you follow how the river
finds its way to the sea</i>

32:25.609 --> 32:29.580
<i>You'll notice every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

32:29.680 --> 32:32.416
<i>Every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

32:32.516 --> 32:36.270
<i>Every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

32:36.370 --> 32:38.689
<i>Every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

32:38.789 --> 32:42.293
<i>Every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

32:42.393 --> 32:46.409
<i>Every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

32:48.499 --> 32:52.514
<i>Every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

33:11.489 --> 33:14.037
<i>Every part of you</i>

33:15.826 --> 33:21.317
<i>Every part of you
is just another part of me</i>

33:35.379 --> 33:37.348
I really needed that.

33:37.448 --> 33:41.524
So I think everybody's gonna go to Noah's
after for dinner. Do you want to come?

33:41.624 --> 33:43.479
To Noah's?

33:43.579 --> 33:45.629
He owns the barn.

33:46.690 --> 33:49.769
- Linda Carr owns the barn.
- That was his mom.

33:51.295 --> 33:55.207
- No way.
- Linda Carr Bernstein.

33:56.233 --> 33:58.035
She died a couple of years ago.

33:58.135 --> 34:01.618
I think it's pretty cool
that he kept this place going.

34:04.441 --> 34:06.484
So you coming?

34:17.804 --> 34:19.842
You need help down there?

34:21.058 --> 34:24.574
- Who need some more wine?
- A little bit more of the red.

34:44.815 --> 34:46.784
Who listens to the radio anymore?

34:46.884 --> 34:51.029
98.3 is part of the perks
of living in Woodstock.

34:51.455 --> 34:55.074
And I love the radio. Remember the days
when you had to wait for a good song?

34:55.175 --> 35:00.097
Instant gratification is the tagline
of our generation. So I get you.

35:00.197 --> 35:01.720
They play all the local bands

35:01.820 --> 35:04.518
and new stuff people are still
working on, which is cool to hear.

35:04.618 --> 35:08.065
It's the reason why I listen to music.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.386
I always have it on at my office.
It's just the best.

35:11.742 --> 35:13.662
So, Catherine, what brought you up here?

35:17.227 --> 35:21.052
Well, I own a house here, and I haven't
been back in years and years.

35:21.652 --> 35:25.272
Just thought I'd take a break
and do some writing.

35:25.889 --> 35:27.458
You're a writer?

35:27.558 --> 35:30.261
Yes, singer... well,
songwriter/singer...

35:30.361 --> 35:32.763
so, whatever, yes, I'm a writer.

35:32.863 --> 35:34.832
Cool, what kind of stuff do you write?

35:34.932 --> 35:38.302
I guess you could say
that it is in the folk family.

35:38.402 --> 35:40.927
- It's a good family to be in.
- Yeah.

35:41.939 --> 35:43.999
Why don't you play something?

35:45.275 --> 35:47.511
- Come on, play something.
- No... no, it's okay.

35:47.611 --> 35:49.706
- This is a great audience.
- Yeah, I can tell...

35:49.806 --> 35:55.187
Well, actually, I did just finish
one song that I can play,

35:55.987 --> 35:57.554
- but...
- So there we go.

35:57.654 --> 35:59.323
- Come on.
- Yeah!

35:59.423 --> 36:01.772
- Do it.
- Let's hear it.

36:07.331 --> 36:09.107
<i>No</i>

36:09.567 --> 36:12.265
<i>I really don't think so</i>

36:13.137 --> 36:18.476
<i>Did you think I'd be incapable
of being on my own?</i>

36:19.576 --> 36:21.218
<i>No</i>

36:21.712 --> 36:25.049
<i>I really don't think so</i>

36:25.549 --> 36:31.355
<i>That I would for a second
let you back in through my door</i>

36:31.455 --> 36:36.527
<i>I have spent many a night even when</i>

36:36.627 --> 36:42.266
<i>I was by your side
I shed tears I couldn't cry</i>

36:42.366 --> 36:45.302
<i>I shed tears I couldn't dry</i>

36:45.402 --> 36:50.975
<i>But I should thank you
for taking my blindfold off</i>

36:51.075 --> 36:56.714
<i>Now I ain't jaded no more, no more</i>

36:56.814 --> 37:01.619
<i>And I take pride in being the one
that said good-bye</i>

37:01.719 --> 37:07.391
<i>That could only mean I am me once more</i>

37:07.491 --> 37:11.286
<i>That can only mean I am me</i>

37:11.386 --> 37:14.123
<i>Once more</i>

37:21.472 --> 37:22.906
That sounded great.

37:24.308 --> 37:26.553
Why haven't you ever come back?

37:27.818 --> 37:31.482
Just... you know never got around to it.

37:31.582 --> 37:34.218
It wasn't on the old agenda.

37:34.518 --> 37:40.108
Also my... my parents died
when I was little here, so...

37:40.208 --> 37:44.561
I guess it kind of...
brought back some memories.

37:44.861 --> 37:48.479
Where's the... where's the bathroom?
Is that on the... in the veranda?

37:48.579 --> 37:50.542
Okay, I'm gonna run to the bathroom.

38:05.549 --> 38:08.200
Bobby Charles.

38:08.786 --> 38:10.421
"I Must Be in a Good Place Now."

38:10.521 --> 38:14.300
I used to hear this song
all the time when I was a kid.

38:15.259 --> 38:20.383
I'd sit under the table in the kitchen
and watch their bare feet swaying around.

38:23.600 --> 38:27.037
They'd pretend not to know
I was down there.

38:27.137 --> 38:30.522
"I wonder if Catherine
is sleeping tight?"

38:45.122 --> 38:47.816
Jackie De Shannon.

38:48.158 --> 38:50.492
Oh, "The Weight."

38:52.496 --> 38:55.850
This must be the best song ever written.

39:06.510 --> 39:08.755
Like, it must be.

39:11.648 --> 39:15.929
The first night we met
when I brought you to my office...

39:18.221 --> 39:20.124
I watched you sleep the whole night.

39:20.424 --> 39:22.642
Well, that's borderline creepy.

39:23.861 --> 39:25.910
And I thought...

39:29.866 --> 39:34.302
this is the most beautiful person...

39:35.563 --> 39:37.435
ever made.

39:43.647 --> 39:45.224
I should go.

39:46.216 --> 39:48.036
Yeah.

39:59.996 --> 40:01.473
Thank you.

40:02.799 --> 40:06.952
I never got a chance to thank you
for last week, so...

40:08.338 --> 40:12.026
thank you, and for the compliment.

40:14.845 --> 40:17.110
I don't think I've ever gotten
a compliment like that.

41:17.774 --> 41:20.297
- Is Emily here?
- No.

41:20.397 --> 41:22.017
Okay.

41:23.780 --> 41:26.560
- You're Lee Ann Frank, right?
- That would be me.

41:26.660 --> 41:30.571
- I'm a huge fan.
- Oh, thank you, honey.

41:30.671 --> 41:34.324
- Can I get you something?
- Yeah, a coffee would be great.

41:34.424 --> 41:35.729
Yeah, it's a cold night.

41:35.829 --> 41:38.873
It's freezing. I don't know
how you guys do it.

41:38.923 --> 41:40.931
That's the best part.

41:41.031 --> 41:45.402
The weather these mountains make.
Are you just visiting Woodstock?

41:45.502 --> 41:49.339
Actually, I moved back here, I guess.

41:50.816 --> 41:53.577
That's great. Where to?

41:53.677 --> 41:56.146
The Brown house on Gray street.

41:56.646 --> 42:01.151
- It's right next to the Gilard farm.
- Yeah, I didn't know that house sold.

42:01.231 --> 42:02.875
Oh, it's mine...

42:02.975 --> 42:05.758
or it was my parents'.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.281
- So what do I owe you?
- On me.

42:12.613 --> 42:15.593
- You sure?
- Welcome back.

42:20.237 --> 42:23.987
Oh, hey... I didn't catch your name.

42:24.087 --> 42:26.810
Catherine. Catherine Brown.

42:27.310 --> 42:28.660
Yes.

42:28.760 --> 42:32.277
Well, welcome back to Woodstock,
Catherine Brown.

42:32.777 --> 42:34.629
Thanks.

42:35.952 --> 42:40.200
And it was really special to meet you.

42:48.231 --> 42:49.867
Hey!

42:50.667 --> 42:55.087
- Oh, God, you scared me.
- Sorry, your coffee. Sorry.

42:55.487 --> 42:57.091
Hi.

43:00.410 --> 43:03.547
- Are you that way?
- Yeah, I'm on Gray Road.

43:03.647 --> 43:05.382
That's close to me. I'll walk with you.

43:06.582 --> 43:09.252
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

43:09.752 --> 43:13.657
Ryan and I are just covered in red wine.

43:13.757 --> 43:15.444
And we're just laughing so hard,

43:15.544 --> 43:18.861
and we're so scared that the headmaster's
gonna come find us.

43:18.961 --> 43:22.832
- Nice.
- And so Ryan looks at me and she goes,

43:22.932 --> 43:26.128
"Hey, do you know the one
with two sailors who go out to sea

43:26.228 --> 43:29.983
and get covered in red wine?"
I knew that one.

43:31.141 --> 43:36.111
And we figured out that we could
laugh at the same things, and...

43:36.161 --> 43:39.222
so she's... she's family.

43:39.516 --> 43:41.766
And you've no other family?

43:44.854 --> 43:48.672
Not... not anyone close enough to count.

43:49.192 --> 43:51.603
And Ryan got you the job at Abundant?

43:52.195 --> 43:54.398
Is this gonna be
a one-way street the whole way?

43:54.498 --> 43:57.934
'Cause I feel like I'm talking too much.

43:58.034 --> 44:00.149
I like it.

44:02.039 --> 44:04.554
I also like it.

44:04.575 --> 44:06.143
<i>You're with who?</i>

44:06.243 --> 44:09.213
I know, it's kind of crazy.

44:09.313 --> 44:11.915
<i>Yeah, pretty crazy.</i>

44:12.015 --> 44:14.017
We just made love to your song.

44:14.117 --> 44:16.453
<i>Oh. That's... special.</i>

44:16.553 --> 44:20.241
It was amazing,
and your song was amazing.

44:22.793 --> 44:25.195
Say thank you. It was a compliment.

44:25.295 --> 44:26.640
<i>Thank you.</i>

44:28.131 --> 44:29.679
<i>Hey, Ryan, Ryan. What are you doing?</i>

44:29.713 --> 44:32.736
I'm getting ready.
It's Jody's press junket tonight.

44:32.836 --> 44:34.738
<i>Jody... Sinclair?</i>

44:34.838 --> 44:37.147
<i>Why are you working with her?</i>

44:39.209 --> 44:43.814
I have my reasons. Trust me.
I have my reasons.

44:49.286 --> 44:52.456
- It feels good, man. I'm feeling it.
- Yes, I'm feeling it.

44:52.556 --> 44:55.410
- It's like this that hippie hit.
- We've hit the nail on the head.

44:55.758 --> 44:57.477
Kudos.

44:57.577 --> 45:00.063
Not you. Bam, we did good.

45:00.163 --> 45:02.299
- Good job.
- Good job.

45:02.399 --> 45:04.226
So...

45:04.326 --> 45:06.530
So you seeing anyone
at the moment, Ryan?

45:06.620 --> 45:08.955
Can you stop breathing on me? Thank you.

45:19.483 --> 45:21.885
Oh, you're closed, sorry.

45:21.985 --> 45:24.316
Oh, hi, Catherine.

45:24.416 --> 45:26.515
You want some coffee?

45:26.815 --> 45:28.106
No, no.

45:29.492 --> 45:33.730
- So what do you do?
- Oh, I'm a singer and a songwriter.

45:33.830 --> 45:35.755
- I think.
- You think?

45:35.855 --> 45:39.903
Yeah, well, I'll know when I write
something brilliant and people listen to it.

45:40.003 --> 45:43.019
"Brilliant." Kind of overrated.

45:43.119 --> 45:46.526
Yeah, I've actually been having
a really hard time writing.

45:46.576 --> 45:49.631
And I'm just not censoring myself,

45:49.632 --> 45:53.323
and the thing that I really like
about your music is your lyrics,

45:53.423 --> 45:57.130
how sly they are,
how smart they are, just...

45:57.230 --> 46:00.156
the song is so much cooler
than whoever's listening to it.

46:00.256 --> 46:05.128
It's just totally...
it's totally uncensored.

46:05.228 --> 46:07.097
Well, thank you. That's sweet.

46:07.197 --> 46:09.866
You know my dad used to listen
to your music all the time?

46:09.966 --> 46:12.285
He'd sit out on the front porch
and play your album.

46:12.385 --> 46:14.221
Yeah.

46:15.071 --> 46:17.807
Well, we wrote some songs together,
your dad and I.

46:17.907 --> 46:20.377
- You did?
- Yes, we did.

46:20.477 --> 46:22.445
I knew there was a reason
I was looking for you.

46:22.545 --> 46:25.515
Well, why don't you come by
one night after we close?

46:25.615 --> 46:28.585
I'll give you some pointers,
help you with those lyrics.

46:28.685 --> 46:30.733
Really?

47:08.224 --> 47:10.587
It's still here.

47:45.395 --> 47:48.765
Hey, Mr. Harmon is gonna kill you.

47:48.865 --> 47:50.595
He'll leave it up eventually.

47:51.045 --> 47:54.470
Yes, he will.
So what happened the other night?

47:54.570 --> 47:57.909
- You left so fast.
- Nothing. I mean...

47:58.409 --> 48:00.355
nothing at all.

48:00.443 --> 48:04.891
It was really nice. Noah's... very nice.

48:06.516 --> 48:09.598
Apparently, he's boning
a Namibian model.

48:10.687 --> 48:12.689
So he's that guy.

48:12.789 --> 48:15.025
I just wanted you to know.

48:15.425 --> 48:17.776
I'm just saying you should be careful.

48:18.661 --> 48:20.604
A model?

48:22.932 --> 48:24.045
Noted.

48:38.297 --> 48:40.917
<i>I've collected</i>

48:41.017 --> 48:44.168
<i>Broken parts</i>

48:45.438 --> 48:51.299
<i>Too many lovers with empty hearts</i>

48:52.528 --> 48:58.519
<i>The only son of a loveless war</i>

48:59.769 --> 49:04.250
<i>Made my home at any open door</i>

49:05.659 --> 49:09.429
<i>Now this lonely world that rises cold</i>

49:09.479 --> 49:13.250
<i>Above my story that remains untold</i>

49:13.700 --> 49:17.337
<i>I pray the time would come</i>

49:17.437 --> 49:22.108
<i>This heart would find the sun</i>

49:22.208 --> 49:24.222
<i>Oh</i>

49:24.928 --> 49:28.113
<i>I was a runner man</i>

49:28.798 --> 49:31.501
<i>A lost boy</i>

49:31.601 --> 49:35.150
<i>Never had a plan</i>

49:35.605 --> 49:39.876
<i>Then your love showed me</i>

49:39.926 --> 49:42.546
<i>The other way</i>

49:42.779 --> 49:45.732
<i>Now from you</i>

49:46.366 --> 49:49.436
<i>I will never run away</i>

49:49.986 --> 49:52.348
<i>No</i>

49:52.648 --> 49:55.628
<i>I won't run away</i>

49:57.026 --> 49:59.625
<i>Run away</i>

50:00.246 --> 50:02.730
<i>Won't run away</i>

50:03.316 --> 50:06.661
<i>I won't run away</i>

50:07.704 --> 50:10.387
<i>From you</i>

50:12.742 --> 50:15.512
That sounds like him.
Thank you for playing that.

50:15.612 --> 50:19.749
Oh, sure. I had to go find it
yesterday after you left.

50:19.849 --> 50:22.263
All right, let me see.

50:24.421 --> 50:27.603
"Follow the River to Me."

50:28.057 --> 50:29.804
- It's dumb.
- No.

50:29.904 --> 50:34.831
No, it's not dumb. It's just maybe there's
something, you know, more poetic.

50:36.166 --> 50:39.354
- I feel like I'm trying too hard.
- And working too hard.

50:39.954 --> 50:44.040
- Is there such a thing?
- In art, yeah. It's a balance.

50:44.140 --> 50:45.742
You definitely have to put in the time,

50:46.142 --> 50:49.779
but, you know, then you also
just have to let it flow.

50:49.879 --> 50:54.117
You just have to be easy with it.
Where would you follow the river to?

50:54.967 --> 50:57.604
Literally, to the sea.

50:58.955 --> 51:02.759
<i>Follow the river to the sea</i>

51:02.859 --> 51:05.028
<i>Follow the river to the sea</i>

51:05.128 --> 51:08.948
And that's why you're a genius.

51:09.532 --> 51:11.914
Why don't you perform anymore?

51:13.102 --> 51:15.849
You know, if there's any advice
I can give you,

51:16.249 --> 51:19.819
it's don't love anyone
who makes you hate your art.

51:21.894 --> 51:24.738
<i>I remember you</i>

51:26.549 --> 51:30.086
<i>In fragments of the past I knew</i>

51:30.186 --> 51:32.488
<i>But lately, it escapes me</i>

51:32.588 --> 51:38.603
<i>Reserves itself to the moments
I feel most alone</i>

51:39.145 --> 51:43.126
- <i>When I play familiar tunes...</i>
- There she is.

51:43.165 --> 51:45.713
The prettiest voice in Woodstock.

51:46.535 --> 51:47.971
Walk me home?

51:48.021 --> 51:52.475
<i>...I can see you in a song
I can hear you hum along</i>

51:52.575 --> 51:56.425
<i>And I know every word, too</i>

51:56.979 --> 52:02.051
<i>And I will find you in the hills tonight</i>

52:02.351 --> 52:06.956
<i>I will meet you in the moonlight</i>

52:07.056 --> 52:11.861
<i>You'll be here by my side
Take back all the tears I cried</i>

52:11.961 --> 52:16.882
<i>I am home, I am home now</i>

52:17.967 --> 52:21.445
<i>I wish you could have known</i>

52:22.705 --> 52:26.242
<i>The world I built all on my own</i>

52:26.342 --> 52:29.045
<i>All my triumphs, my disasters</i>

52:29.145 --> 52:30.980
<i>The lies that I've known</i>

52:31.080 --> 52:35.130
<i>I'd have told you
could I have called you on the phone</i>

52:35.551 --> 52:40.363
<i>And I will find you in the hills tonight</i>

52:40.907 --> 52:44.243
<i>I will meet you in the moonlight</i>

52:44.293 --> 52:48.431
- You want to feel like you're floating?
- <i>You'll be here by my side</i>

52:48.531 --> 52:51.334
<i>Take back all those tears I cried</i>

52:51.434 --> 52:56.051
<i>I am home, I am home</i>

52:57.907 --> 53:00.052
I fell asleep here once.

53:02.111 --> 53:04.757
I just couldn't manage
to leave one night.

53:13.639 --> 53:15.508
The barn used to be my mother's.

53:16.158 --> 53:19.395
I know. Emily told me.

53:19.495 --> 53:22.098
It's strange to own something
that used to be theirs.

53:22.198 --> 53:24.801
I still feel guilty
about changing the drapes.

53:25.201 --> 53:27.451
Like you'll get in trouble.

53:27.670 --> 53:30.240
This is crazy 'cause it happened
so long ago for me,

53:30.340 --> 53:33.443
but sometimes like it's where
they just went out to a party.

53:33.543 --> 53:36.946
Or the whole day goes by and I wonder
why my mother hasn't called.

53:37.046 --> 53:41.491
I know, it's weird.
Sometimes more weird than sad.

53:42.552 --> 53:44.987
My friends complain about their parents,

53:45.087 --> 53:50.166
how they yell at them or they hate them
for being human and failing.

53:50.526 --> 53:52.295
Yeah.

53:52.495 --> 53:54.779
And they're just lucky.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.886
Lucky ducks.

54:15.418 --> 54:20.001
<i>Turn down the bed sheets</i>

54:22.475 --> 54:25.734
<i>In the spare room</i>

54:27.764 --> 54:33.503
<i>To catch up on the life</i>

54:34.003 --> 54:37.507
<i>That seems to stand still</i>

54:37.607 --> 54:41.025
<i>She wakes to find</i>

54:42.411 --> 54:44.629
<i>A souvenir</i>

54:47.216 --> 54:51.964
<i>And glass cabinets</i>

54:53.389 --> 54:55.871
<i>With fingerprints...</i>

54:56.692 --> 54:58.906
- Hello?
- <i>Morning, Catherine?</i>

55:00.029 --> 55:03.866
- Who is this?
- <i>It's Ron. How are you?</i>

55:04.570 --> 55:06.469
Ron, hi.

55:06.569 --> 55:09.672
- <i>I'm not calling too early, am I?</i>
- Yeah, no, it's not too early.

55:09.772 --> 55:12.475
- <i>I listened to those tracks that you...</i>
- You did?

55:12.575 --> 55:15.912
- No, I didn't ask Ryan to do that, but...
- <i>No, but she sent us them.</i>

55:16.012 --> 55:20.331
Yeah, you called me, though.
Well, I'm not a hustler.

55:20.983 --> 55:25.493
No, that's okay, that's great.
Like, how many songs?

55:25.593 --> 55:27.997
<i>It's not a problem, is it?</i>

55:28.591 --> 55:33.262
- Yeah, I think I can do that.
- <i>Brilliant. By the 24th.</i>

55:33.362 --> 55:36.032
- The 24th? That's...
- <i>On the 24th.</i>

55:36.132 --> 55:38.227
That is in a week.

55:38.327 --> 55:41.481
No, I think so. I think, yeah,
I can do that. I think I can do that.

55:42.671 --> 55:44.373
Okay.

55:44.473 --> 55:47.109
Yeah, that's... thank you.

55:48.339 --> 55:50.880
I will see you... I will be there.

55:50.980 --> 55:53.467
Okay, bye. Okay.

55:57.420 --> 55:59.471
I...

55:59.771 --> 56:02.928
am going to Abundant Records
on the 24th.

56:03.028 --> 56:06.913
I have a 2:00 in the studio.

56:07.013 --> 56:10.166
What? I don't even know what to say.

56:10.266 --> 56:14.170
Oh, this is crazy. They want me
to prepare all of my tracks.

56:14.270 --> 56:19.159
I only have...
I have one good one so far.

56:20.510 --> 56:23.006
Would you ever move back to the city?

56:27.483 --> 56:31.773
Yeah, I mean, for a record deal,
I would do anything.

56:33.623 --> 56:34.674
You...

56:35.573 --> 56:38.594
are a good luck charm, Noah Bernstein.

56:40.763 --> 56:43.532
They don't call me
the magic stick for nothing.

56:43.967 --> 56:46.882
Oh, you did not say that.

56:50.539 --> 56:52.152
Stay.

56:53.209 --> 56:54.810
I can't.

56:54.910 --> 56:58.081
I have to prepare all these songs and
this week just became really important...

56:58.181 --> 57:03.798
Come on, I will cancel my 12:00
at the office, make you breakfast.

57:03.853 --> 57:05.602
Stay.

57:07.106 --> 57:10.043
Fine. Fine.

57:10.093 --> 57:12.524
But you're here now!

57:42.024 --> 57:43.893
Hi.

57:43.993 --> 57:48.639
I know, I just thought
what's another couple hours?

57:51.533 --> 57:54.853
Hi. Surprise.

57:55.237 --> 57:57.849
I just couldn't help myself.

58:00.676 --> 58:02.525
Okay.

58:19.261 --> 58:20.947
What?

58:21.664 --> 58:23.933
What? What?

58:24.033 --> 58:25.944
After you, miss.

58:30.806 --> 58:33.375
<i>Noah</i>

58:33.660 --> 58:36.463
<i>You're an asshole</i>

58:37.513 --> 58:39.758
<i>Noah</i>

58:40.316 --> 58:42.497
<i>You're a jerk</i>

58:45.988 --> 58:47.623
<i>Noah</i>

58:47.723 --> 58:50.597
<i>I really don't think so</i>

58:51.093 --> 58:53.429
<i>I think you hate women</i>

58:53.529 --> 58:56.307
<i>And you are an asshole</i>

58:57.033 --> 58:58.403
Oh, my God.

58:59.235 --> 59:01.871
They all just want to break
our hearts, don't they?

59:01.971 --> 59:05.574
I blame Eve.
That's what it comes down to.

59:05.624 --> 59:09.962
We are being punished
because this selfish naked gal

59:10.012 --> 59:11.697
who just couldn't help herself,

59:11.797 --> 59:15.735
we are left on this planet,
and we're trying to, like,

59:15.785 --> 59:17.971
do what's right by life.

59:18.454 --> 59:21.224
Never give it up, Lee Ann. Never.

59:21.274 --> 59:25.646
I don't think that's possible,
even if I tried. Look where we live.

59:32.134 --> 59:35.371
You know what?
They only like you until they get you,

59:35.471 --> 59:39.624
and they're gonna lie, and they're gonna
cheat, and steal until they get you.

59:39.724 --> 59:45.648
And... no, nothing is gonna get me down
this time. Nothing's bringing me down.

59:45.748 --> 59:48.917
Chastity belt all up in here.

59:49.004 --> 59:53.355
I forgot to tell you something. This is
gonna make you feel so much better.

59:53.455 --> 59:56.225
Have you ever heard of Billy Todd,
Classic Soul Recordings?

59:56.325 --> 59:59.227
It's this awesome, I mean,

59:59.327 --> 01:00:02.597
awesome little indie label
outside of Nashville,

01:00:02.697 --> 01:00:04.567
and Billy's an old friend of mine.

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:07.270
And he is the real-deal
kind of music guy.

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:11.807
I never asked him for anything,
ever, and I called him.

01:00:11.907 --> 01:00:17.519
And he is gonna come here to Woodstock
on the 24th to hear you sing.

01:00:17.617 --> 01:00:22.034
I'm telling you, I just got a feeling
that this is gonna be the perfect match.

01:00:22.134 --> 01:00:25.671
You'll come here after closing
just like you've been doing,

01:00:25.721 --> 01:00:28.224
and you will sing for my friend.

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:30.142
You good?

01:00:31.927 --> 01:00:35.912
- The 24th?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is that a problem?

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:40.136
No, not.

01:00:40.236 --> 01:00:44.339
- I will be here.
- It's gonna be so great.

01:00:44.445 --> 01:00:47.938
- I love this cake.
- I know, man, this is my favorite cake.

01:00:53.949 --> 01:00:57.270
Focus, focus, focus.

01:00:59.571 --> 01:01:02.741
Think, think.

01:01:02.791 --> 01:01:05.061
Think, think.

01:01:05.072 --> 01:01:07.396
<i>If I stop too...</i>

01:01:07.496 --> 01:01:12.747
<i>If I stop too long to think</i>

01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:19.760
<i>Nothing good can come from that</i>

01:01:22.344 --> 01:01:25.291
<i>You don't have to tell me</i>

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:30.295
<i>That I'm running scared</i>

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:36.540
<i>I am fully present</i>

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:38.278
<i>I am</i>

01:01:42.097 --> 01:01:44.518
<i>Totally aware</i>

01:01:45.518 --> 01:01:50.635
<i>Nothing's gonna break me down</i>

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:57.397
<i>And I don't know anymore</i>

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:01.294
<i>Than I did way back then</i>

01:02:03.118 --> 01:02:07.166
<i>It's just that I am done with moving</i>

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:11.302
<i>In the wrong direction</i>

01:02:13.095 --> 01:02:17.667
<i>Love, I wouldn't change
a thing, you know</i>

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:21.049
<i>I never could pretend</i>

01:02:23.138 --> 01:02:26.585
<i>Nothing's gonna break</i>

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:30.476
<i>Nothing's gonna break</i>

01:02:31.276 --> 01:02:33.632
<i>Me down</i>

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:42.659
<i>Nothing's gonna break me down</i>

01:02:49.495 --> 01:02:51.100
That was dope.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.619
- Thanks for helping.
- Yeah, of course.

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:57.247
I should get going.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.732
He's a weirdo.

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:12.368
- You know, I should probably go, too.
- Yeah.

01:03:13.422 --> 01:03:15.991
- You gonna come?
- No, I'm gonna wait for Lee Ann.

01:03:16.091 --> 01:03:19.374
- Have a good night.
- You, too.

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:29.104
<i>Dear fellow traveler under the moon</i>

01:03:29.204 --> 01:03:33.976
<i>I saw you standing in the shadows
And your eyes would bloom</i>

01:03:34.376 --> 01:03:38.263
<i>You put your hand down,
opened the door...</i>

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:42.585
- Hey, Em.
- Hey.

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:44.653
- Is Catherine here?
- Nope.

01:03:44.753 --> 01:03:46.689
Actually, I haven't seen her all day.

01:03:47.885 --> 01:03:50.975
Right, the 24th, she's in the city.

01:03:51.376 --> 01:03:53.879
Is she mad at me?
Has she said anything to you?

01:03:54.548 --> 01:03:57.049
No. She's kind of a private person.

01:03:57.149 --> 01:03:59.999
I'm sure if she's mad,
you must have done something.

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:06.275
Look, she really likes you.
Don't be a dick.

01:04:06.775 --> 01:04:11.288
I'll work on that. Thanks, I wasn't planning
on it, but thanks for the advice.

01:04:11.513 --> 01:04:14.716
One thing I know about men,
you can't help it.

01:04:14.816 --> 01:04:17.786
You just sneeze the wrong way,
and you break our hearts.

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:29.716
Ryan?

01:04:30.899 --> 01:04:32.676
Ry?

01:04:33.735 --> 01:04:36.838
- Ryan?
- What? I'm not sleeping.

01:04:36.938 --> 01:04:40.275
Surprise! I forgot to call you.

01:04:40.375 --> 01:04:42.252
I've noticed.

01:04:44.679 --> 01:04:46.982
How very coming of age of you.

01:04:47.482 --> 01:04:49.769
- I miss you.
- I have something...

01:04:49.869 --> 01:04:52.388
incredibly important to tell you,
like, it is insane.

01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:55.419
- Can I come by after the meeting?
- Yes.

01:04:55.469 --> 01:04:58.277
- Okay.
- Good luck and...

01:04:58.327 --> 01:04:59.995
What?

01:05:00.495 --> 01:05:02.703
It never hurts with those two.

01:05:02.803 --> 01:05:04.942
Thanks for the pick-me-up.

01:05:10.105 --> 01:05:13.440
Your little hippy polka song
sounded weird at first,

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:16.372
I'm not gonna lie.
That wasn't even finished.

01:05:16.472 --> 01:05:20.482
It was a mess. It sounded like
a Bar Mitzvah video or something.

01:05:20.582 --> 01:05:22.687
Yeah, it sounded Jewish.

01:05:22.688 --> 01:05:25.905
Yeah, like really,
very Jewish, actually.

01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:28.340
- But people are into hipsters.
- Everyone's moving to Brooklyn.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.776
We took your song
and pumped it up a little bit,

01:05:31.876 --> 01:05:36.193
put a little beat behind it,
and immediately... I saw fragrance.

01:05:36.293 --> 01:05:39.134
- Oh, yeah, fragrance.
- I saw girls crying about their boyfriends.

01:05:39.234 --> 01:05:41.303
- Just crying.
- I saw covers of magazines.

01:05:41.403 --> 01:05:43.187
- Magazines.
- You are relatable.

01:05:43.287 --> 01:05:46.442
- Yeah, and relatable sells.
- Do you understand what we're saying?

01:05:47.247 --> 01:05:49.880
- I think so.
- Catherine, get a lawyer.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:54.266
- We want to sign you.
- See, you plus a beat, it's record gold.

01:05:54.366 --> 01:05:57.109
Okay, record gold, baby.

01:05:57.719 --> 01:06:00.297
What... what do you mean
by "plus a beat"?

01:06:02.324 --> 01:06:06.110
- Party over here.
- Party over there.

01:06:07.429 --> 01:06:10.182
See? A-mazing?

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:22.724
Just one moment.

01:06:46.301 --> 01:06:48.148
I love it.

01:06:50.071 --> 01:06:52.585
Let me play you the new stuff.

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:01.950
Catherine. Hey, can we talk?

01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:04.457
- No. No way, no.
- Please, please. Please don't walk away.

01:07:04.557 --> 01:07:07.773
- Please just don't walk away.
- How did you even know that I was here?

01:07:07.873 --> 01:07:10.426
- Sally.
- Sally.

01:07:11.426 --> 01:07:13.445
It's good to see you.

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:20.051
Can we just go get a glass
of wine and just... please?

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:22.671
Just one little glass.

01:07:22.771 --> 01:07:24.206
- You know, no.
- Just to talk.

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:26.441
You know what, I have this thing
tonight in Woodstock

01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:30.729
and I was supposed to go say hi to Ryan,
and, shit, I don't want to go back in there.

01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:34.426
Listen, look, look at you.
Look how stressed out you are.

01:07:42.841 --> 01:07:45.858
Let's just go focus on you
for one night.

01:07:46.094 --> 01:07:48.139
Come on.

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:59.274
God, I real... I miss this,
like, being open with you

01:07:59.374 --> 01:08:02.944
and I'm just being
so open with somebody.

01:08:03.044 --> 01:08:06.388
You're not open with your French girl?

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:12.431
I think I need to go into treatment,
like a rehab. I...

01:08:13.455 --> 01:08:14.923
I think I'm a sex addict.

01:08:15.023 --> 01:08:18.359
I need to curb this thing in me
that just wants to sabotage things

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:21.162
and have sex with them
and just be gluttonous

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:24.573
'cause I think have boundary
issues, and I... I...

01:08:24.673 --> 01:08:27.569
I think I... you know what?
I think I want to be gluten-free,

01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:30.604
and I just want to change
everything about myself

01:08:30.705 --> 01:08:34.509
so you won't even recognize me,
and I'll do that today,

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.962
I will change everything... right now.

01:08:37.758 --> 01:08:39.298
I mean it.

01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:42.764
Where... where's your ring?

01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:47.540
I sold it.

01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:50.032
You...

01:08:51.493 --> 01:08:55.096
Well, I deser... I deserve that,
but here's the thing, Cat.

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:59.334
Ten years is ten years, and things
were getting weird between us.

01:08:59.434 --> 01:09:04.272
You know, and I messed up.
Everyone messes up. You make mistakes.

01:09:04.372 --> 01:09:06.983
Okay, I made bigger mistakes, but...

01:09:07.683 --> 01:09:11.979
Catherine, you know that we always
come back to each other.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:15.157
You know we do,
and I have always been here for you.

01:09:15.256 --> 01:09:18.987
I know everything about everything
about you. Doesn't that mean something?

01:09:19.087 --> 01:09:20.856
And I...

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:24.453
I mean, I'm an idiot,
but I'm your idiot.

01:09:26.394 --> 01:09:29.046
And your idiots are hard to come by.

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:39.720
Tell me.

01:10:25.034 --> 01:10:28.262
Where is my phone? Come on.

01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:38.805
Lee Ann, I am so sorry.

01:10:39.205 --> 01:10:40.870
I just have a lot going on.

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:43.841
And I was in the city,
and Abundant Records wants to sign me,

01:10:43.941 --> 01:10:45.877
- but they ruined my song.
- Abundant Records?

01:10:45.977 --> 01:10:48.691
- Garret showed up.
- That's where you were?

01:10:48.791 --> 01:10:51.984
It's a long story. I just...
last night was not working out for me.

01:10:52.084 --> 01:10:57.428
That's what I've been helping you
write for, that horrible sell-out company?

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.922
See, this is why I didn't
want to tell you,

01:11:01.022 --> 01:11:04.993
because I thought that you would react
like this. That company is pretty major.

01:11:06.093 --> 01:11:08.663
Did you forget how they fired you
without a glance?

01:11:08.763 --> 01:11:11.277
They make music that you hate.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.303
- Well, maybe I don't care.
- You don't care about your work?

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:18.473
Yeah, maybe I want to sell out.
Maybe I want to stop trying so hard.

01:11:18.573 --> 01:11:19.693
Honey...

01:11:19.793 --> 01:11:22.937
you are so much better than what
just came out of your mouth.

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:26.782
I should just go back to the city.
I don't belong here.

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:29.501
Wherever you go,
you take yourself with you.

01:11:29.601 --> 01:11:34.456
You think the gauge for not trying
so hard is that it feels easy?

01:11:34.556 --> 01:11:36.608
Well, you're wrong.

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:39.811
Yeah, says the woman
who won't sing in public anymore

01:11:39.911 --> 01:11:43.448
'cause some guy told her that
her voice quivers on the wrong octave.

01:11:43.998 --> 01:11:45.500
Oh, yeah.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.870
Right, yeah, you're right.

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:52.422
Who am I to lecture you on good choices?

01:11:53.608 --> 01:11:55.594
For the record...

01:11:56.511 --> 01:11:59.296
I went out on the line for you.

01:12:03.618 --> 01:12:06.004
You should go back to the city.

01:12:07.388 --> 01:12:09.074
You don't belong here.

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:06.065
Catherine.

01:13:06.865 --> 01:13:09.751
- Hi.
- Hi, I thought you were in Woodstock.

01:13:09.851 --> 01:13:13.367
I was. I just had an awful 24 hours,

01:13:13.467 --> 01:13:15.724
and I really do miss something.

01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:18.460
I don't know what. I just...
I need a hug.

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.423
I don't know if that's right or whatever,
but I just need a hug...

01:13:21.523 --> 01:13:24.086
Yeah, of course, come here.

01:13:24.966 --> 01:13:28.048
Why are you... why are you greasy?

01:13:29.137 --> 01:13:30.954
I...

01:13:32.024 --> 01:13:34.509
- It's... I...
- Garret?

01:13:34.609 --> 01:13:36.411
- What?
- Why are you greasy?

01:13:36.511 --> 01:13:39.044
It's a... it's oil, and it...

01:13:39.144 --> 01:13:42.214
I don't know. You're supposed to...
it's supposed to like sort of...

01:13:42.313 --> 01:13:45.503
No, no, Catherine, don't go in there!
We were never officially back together.

01:13:45.986 --> 01:13:47.622
Come on!

01:13:47.722 --> 01:13:52.019
You remember. This is Sylvia.
And this is her very close friend, Matilde.

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:55.607
Sorry, can you leave us alone
for a second?

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.746
Catherine, it's all out of con...

01:14:02.103 --> 01:14:05.925
Don't you dare. Give it to me. I implore you
to hand me that marble man statue

01:14:06.012 --> 01:14:08.560
because it's a De Fontana,
and it's insanely expensive.

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:11.252
- Don't, don't, please, please, please...
- Going down.

01:14:11.352 --> 01:14:14.417
...and every part I get, I rub him
on top of his head! Please, don't!

01:14:14.467 --> 01:14:15.835
- No!
- No?

01:14:15.935 --> 01:14:19.921
Okay, Catherine, Catherine.
Good, you... keep control, okay?

01:14:20.021 --> 01:14:23.725
Let's just be reasonable here, all right.
What are you doing? No, no, no!

01:14:23.825 --> 01:14:26.539
Don't, don't...
no, no, no, no, no, no...

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:36.521
- You chopped his little penis off.
- Yeah, it's called retribution, Garret.

01:14:36.621 --> 01:14:38.556
You chopped his little penis off.

01:14:39.411 --> 01:14:41.987
Just be happy I wasn't being literal.

01:14:44.028 --> 01:14:45.020
"Very good friend"?

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:48.633
Yes, and the whole place
is just covered in, like, baby oil,

01:14:48.683 --> 01:14:54.055
and Noah is with this tall,
Namibian lady and Lee Ann is...

01:14:54.155 --> 01:14:57.106
You know what, Catherine?
I can't be here for you right now.

01:14:57.959 --> 01:14:59.361
Why not?

01:14:59.461 --> 01:15:02.631
Do you know that I called you
seven times last week

01:15:02.731 --> 01:15:06.601
and then waited for four hours
for you to stop by after your meeting?

01:15:07.269 --> 01:15:10.659
I was having one of the most
important weeks of my life.

01:15:10.759 --> 01:15:12.424
Yeah, well, so was I.

01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:18.660
Right, right, because the world cannot
revolve around me for just a second.

01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:21.650
What? Are you a mental?

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:26.438
The world's axis sits on your tiny,
little person and spins out of control

01:15:26.538 --> 01:15:31.642
and all I do is clean up your mess,
your constant emotional mess.

01:15:33.193 --> 01:15:36.197
What a joke! I am an emotional mess?

01:15:36.297 --> 01:15:40.038
You're obsessive and sleep around
so much, I have lost penis count.

01:15:40.268 --> 01:15:44.205
You know what? I don't give a shit
what you think about me.

01:15:44.305 --> 01:15:48.867
I am no mental when I am standing across
from the single most insane,

01:15:48.967 --> 01:15:54.996
wildly inappropriate, just downright
wrong person I've ever met.

01:15:57.068 --> 01:15:58.553
I'm pregnant.

01:16:00.805 --> 01:16:02.147
Of course you are.

01:16:04.142 --> 01:16:06.463
- Get out.
- Great.

01:16:11.232 --> 01:16:14.349
And I hate your baby.

01:16:40.873 --> 01:16:42.564
Don't.

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:46.208
Stop, stop. Stop.

01:16:46.968 --> 01:16:49.871
Jesus, dude, I thought you were dead.

01:16:49.971 --> 01:16:52.357
I mean, you look all cracked out
and dead right now.

01:16:52.457 --> 01:16:54.792
I feel like a version of that.

01:16:54.842 --> 01:16:56.911
What the hell happened to you?

01:16:58.924 --> 01:17:04.242
I failed at life. Everybody hates me.
I'm about to sell out to Abundant tomorrow.

01:17:08.022 --> 01:17:09.969
Catherine?

01:17:12.192 --> 01:17:14.103
I'm dying.

01:17:14.203 --> 01:17:15.975
What?

01:17:18.733 --> 01:17:20.906
I mean, I'm not really dying,

01:17:20.946 --> 01:17:23.138
but it kinds of puts shit
into perspective, doesn't it?

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:25.056
Plus you'd feel
like an asshole if I was.

01:17:25.156 --> 01:17:28.406
Somebody should definitely feel
like an asshole right now.

01:17:28.506 --> 01:17:31.791
Look, dude, what do you want?

01:17:32.877 --> 01:17:36.627
If you could want anything
and it didn't matter, what would you want?

01:17:43.321 --> 01:17:45.354
To make the record I wrote out here.

01:17:47.213 --> 01:17:48.799
But...

01:17:48.899 --> 01:17:52.306
But how it sounds, you know, not like...

01:17:53.398 --> 01:17:55.723
and I don't care who puts it out,
who it's through,

01:17:55.823 --> 01:18:00.250
I just... I want it to sound like
how it sounds here, like...

01:18:01.239 --> 01:18:04.297
- I want it to sound like me.
- Good. Let's record it.

01:18:04.397 --> 01:18:06.505
Tell Abundant to take it or leave it.

01:18:06.605 --> 01:18:08.243
Yeah.

01:18:08.343 --> 01:18:10.620
My meeting's tomorrow.

01:18:11.482 --> 01:18:14.225
Where would we even record it?

01:18:16.354 --> 01:18:18.233
No.

01:18:19.057 --> 01:18:20.336
No.

01:18:21.126 --> 01:18:24.096
Will you be my emergency contact?
Thank you.

01:18:24.996 --> 01:18:28.136
You can step right in,
just leave the paperwork on the desk.

01:18:28.933 --> 01:18:29.971
Yeah.

01:18:34.506 --> 01:18:36.276
Hey, doc,

01:18:36.376 --> 01:18:38.458
I got this.

01:18:40.278 --> 01:18:42.647
What are you doing here?

01:18:42.703 --> 01:18:45.650
We wanted to... well...

01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:48.383
- We need to use the studio at the barn.
- That's why you're here?

01:18:48.483 --> 01:18:50.114
Yep.

01:18:50.205 --> 01:18:53.490
Also if you don't mind, cancerous?

01:18:56.995 --> 01:19:00.443
You're fine, but you should be seeing
the dermatologist at least once a year.

01:19:07.805 --> 01:19:09.821
- What was that?
- I don't have cancer.

01:19:09.921 --> 01:19:13.127
No, I know, but, for him to walk out.

01:19:13.277 --> 01:19:16.147
I found the cold-hearted-snake
tone of voice a real doozy.

01:19:16.247 --> 01:19:17.673
Should we leave?

01:19:20.652 --> 01:19:22.497
You can go.

01:19:23.321 --> 01:19:25.239
I set it up.

01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:47.812
No.

01:19:48.012 --> 01:19:51.427
No, he cannot just...

01:19:53.785 --> 01:19:56.633
Hey! Excuse me?

01:19:58.690 --> 01:20:01.445
- What are you doing?
- No, Noah, no.

01:20:01.545 --> 01:20:04.963
You do not get to snub me.
Do you understand that?

01:20:05.063 --> 01:20:09.867
You are not allowed to be cold to me,
when I should be cold to you.

01:20:09.967 --> 01:20:13.338
You slept with me, and it was...

01:20:13.438 --> 01:20:16.317
I mean, it was the be... it was ama...

01:20:16.407 --> 01:20:18.293
four times!

01:20:18.643 --> 01:20:20.912
Okay, no, that's not the point.

01:20:21.012 --> 01:20:23.581
The point is... the point...
the point is this...

01:20:23.681 --> 01:20:26.012
Catherine, what is your point?

01:20:29.888 --> 01:20:31.789
I can't remember!

01:20:31.889 --> 01:20:36.160
Okay, I saw you kiss Garret.

01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:39.297
I drove to the city,
like an idiot, to see you.

01:20:39.397 --> 01:20:41.900
I stood outside of that building
for an hour

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.869
and you walked into someone else's arms.

01:20:44.969 --> 01:20:48.773
- Okay, and I was hurt.
- Understandable.

01:20:48.873 --> 01:20:51.576
You know what? I know what you are.

01:20:51.676 --> 01:20:55.891
You... are a player.

01:20:56.364 --> 01:20:57.865
What the fuck?

01:20:58.762 --> 01:21:01.696
I'm sorry, Mr. Harmon,
but this little liar man here

01:21:01.796 --> 01:21:05.990
has this tall Namibian girlfriend
that he is hiding away somewhere.

01:21:06.090 --> 01:21:08.793
He's just storing her,
and you know what?

01:21:08.893 --> 01:21:10.695
I came to see you, too.

01:21:10.995 --> 01:21:14.866
After I left your house I drove
to your office to surprise you,

01:21:14.966 --> 01:21:18.703
and I see you walk out
with legs-for-days over there.

01:21:18.803 --> 01:21:24.240
So you didn't warn me about you,
but you should have.

01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:25.961
Laura?

01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:30.648
Laura is the new physician assistant
at my office.

01:21:30.748 --> 01:21:34.263
Catherine, I have been single
since my mom died.

01:21:39.591 --> 01:21:43.672
You know what? Catherine,
you should go. You should go.

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:48.813
But I never slept with him,
no, I didn't. He kissed me,

01:21:48.913 --> 01:21:52.971
and then I slept over at his house,
but that was later, hours and hours later,

01:21:53.071 --> 01:21:55.873
and we did sleep in the same bed,
but that was it.

01:21:55.973 --> 01:21:59.524
I couldn't do it, and I thought
that you were ditching me.

01:21:59.624 --> 01:22:02.124
You are the one that I want
to have sex with,

01:22:02.224 --> 01:22:08.002
not Garret, just you, Noah,
like, I want to have sex forever.

01:22:08.152 --> 01:22:11.737
I want have forever sex with you.

01:22:25.002 --> 01:22:27.208
Thanks for the studio.

01:22:37.114 --> 01:22:38.825
Hey.

01:22:42.753 --> 01:22:47.039
I'm so sorry.
I'm really sorry for what I said.

01:22:51.395 --> 01:22:54.282
It wasn't your most tactful moment.

01:22:54.565 --> 01:22:58.102
But there was some truth in all that.

01:22:58.472 --> 01:22:59.771
There was.

01:23:01.372 --> 01:23:03.541
Thank you for helping me,

01:23:03.641 --> 01:23:07.378
for being so generous,
for showing me how to write.

01:23:08.078 --> 01:23:10.528
And showing me how... just...

01:23:12.316 --> 01:23:14.623
what I was looking for when I came here.

01:23:17.305 --> 01:23:19.507
I think you're doing
the right thing today.

01:23:19.557 --> 01:23:21.431
You do?

01:23:21.531 --> 01:23:24.604
'Cause it sounds like you.
As long as you're being honest,

01:23:24.704 --> 01:23:27.311
then it doesn't matter who puts it out.

01:23:30.468 --> 01:23:32.537
I'm proud of you.

01:23:32.637 --> 01:23:35.338
I think your dad would be, too.

01:23:35.438 --> 01:23:37.218
Come on.

01:24:03.968 --> 01:24:06.155
Can I come in?

01:24:10.241 --> 01:24:12.766
I'm so sorry.

01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:15.560
That was our first fight.

01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:19.517
I know. Unless you count the time
you slapped me after prom.

01:24:19.617 --> 01:24:23.754
Blake Rutherford? No. That was
like a "slap back to reality" slap,

01:24:23.854 --> 01:24:25.789
so it doesn't count.

01:24:28.092 --> 01:24:31.278
- I don't hate your baby.
- You don't?

01:24:31.328 --> 01:24:34.889
No. I love your baby.

01:24:34.989 --> 01:24:37.504
It's gonna be the cutest.

01:24:39.017 --> 01:24:40.805
Look at us...

01:24:40.905 --> 01:24:45.376
just a couple of grown-ups
having babies.

01:24:45.476 --> 01:24:46.911
Come here.

01:24:47.211 --> 01:24:50.014
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

01:24:50.114 --> 01:24:52.831
And I'm hungry. I'm always hungry.

01:24:53.184 --> 01:24:55.520
<i>And I don't know...</i>

01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:58.055
Let me think about it. No.

01:24:58.155 --> 01:24:59.757
No.

01:25:00.176 --> 01:25:03.112
<i>...way back then...</i>

01:25:05.996 --> 01:25:07.664
I understand.

01:25:08.281 --> 01:25:12.555
<i>...done with moving</i>

01:25:13.204 --> 01:25:16.286
<i>The wrong direction</i>

01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:23.404
<i>You don't have to tell me</i>

01:25:26.083 --> 01:25:28.267
<i>How it's gonna end...</i>

01:25:30.054 --> 01:25:33.690
<i>All day love songs coming right up.</i>

01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:35.526
<i>We want to hear your stories, folks,</i>

01:25:35.626 --> 01:25:39.563
<i>as we jam out these love songs
all day long.</i>

01:25:39.663 --> 01:25:45.476
<i>But they can only be told if you call in,
so give us a call. 555-ROCK.</i>

01:25:48.105 --> 01:25:51.108
<i>Hey, there, our first caller.</i>

01:25:51.808 --> 01:25:53.744
<i>What's your name?</i>

01:25:53.844 --> 01:25:55.653
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, there.</i>

01:25:55.753 --> 01:25:59.116
Yeah... this is Catherine.

01:25:59.216 --> 01:26:01.519
<i>And you have a love story
for us, Catherine?</i>

01:26:01.619 --> 01:26:03.653
Yes, I do.

01:26:06.262 --> 01:26:11.940
But you know, it's more than that.
It's... it's... it's kind of about...

01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:17.667
music and Woodstock

01:26:17.767 --> 01:26:21.489
and growth and then love.

01:26:22.206 --> 01:26:26.010
Love is kind of the cherry
on top of my story.

01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:27.862
<i>Okay.</i>

01:26:29.079 --> 01:26:30.484
<i>I...</i>

01:26:30.584 --> 01:26:33.429
<i>I think that I may have...</i>

01:26:33.529 --> 01:26:36.835
<i>pushed away the only guy
that I've ever...</i>

01:26:38.855 --> 01:26:44.681
<i>loved. The only guy who's ever made
just complete and total sense and...</i>

01:26:46.764 --> 01:26:50.301
<i>and my dad used to say that love...</i>

01:26:50.401 --> 01:26:54.605
<i>forever love was just all resistance
and pain at the beginning,</i>

01:26:54.705 --> 01:26:58.442
<i>and I think that we got through that,
so we're good,</i>

01:26:58.542 --> 01:27:03.094
<i>and he might be listening
to you right now.</i>

01:27:04.448 --> 01:27:08.168
<i>And if he is,
I just want him to know that...</i>

01:27:08.247 --> 01:27:11.902
he feels like family to me and...

01:27:12.956 --> 01:27:15.702
<i>we both don't have any, so...</i>

01:27:19.263 --> 01:27:22.667
<i>I'm on my way home,
and if he could just forgive me</i>

01:27:22.767 --> 01:27:25.858
<i>or chalk it up to...</i>

01:27:26.444 --> 01:27:30.190
<i>I don't know, rough beginnings,
I would just be the happiest,</i>

01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:35.521
<i>most in-love lady from, I don't know,
Kingston to Woodstock.</i>

01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:41.131
<i>Just setting it all up
so it comes to me if it wants to...</i>

01:27:44.188 --> 01:27:46.367
<i>if he wants to.</i>

01:27:46.824 --> 01:27:49.076
<i>And that's my story.</i>

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.096
You acted crazy at my office.

01:28:59.196 --> 01:29:01.465
Mr. Harmon got an earful.

01:29:01.515 --> 01:29:03.159
I think he's still recovering.

01:29:03.239 --> 01:29:06.354
I'm serious, Catherine. After you left
he complained about heart palpitations

01:29:06.454 --> 01:29:08.944
and told me about his first time.
Her name was Leslie.

01:29:08.994 --> 01:29:13.243
She was blonde and plump
and had perfect lady parts.

01:29:14.278 --> 01:29:16.321
I'm sorry.

01:29:23.521 --> 01:29:25.766
So you're staying here?

01:29:26.841 --> 01:29:28.242
I remembered the point.

01:29:29.043 --> 01:29:30.857
Oh, yeah?

01:29:32.129 --> 01:29:33.797
Love is a battlefield.

01:29:33.897 --> 01:29:35.766
- That's your point?
- Yeah.

01:29:35.866 --> 01:29:39.587
That's your great, big, epic point?

01:29:42.006 --> 01:29:44.341
Look, can you just tell me
if you love me or not?

01:29:44.441 --> 01:29:46.150
I know that's a lot to ask of somebody.

01:29:46.241 --> 01:29:49.163
I know that's a lot to ask
someone to be that clear,

01:29:49.263 --> 01:29:53.400
but I just really need to know
the ending to this part of my story.

01:29:53.450 --> 01:29:55.598
Are you kidding me?

01:29:56.854 --> 01:30:00.107
I fucking love the shit out of you.

01:30:29.253 --> 01:30:31.270
Forever sex time?

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:33.341
You're a serious perv.

01:30:50.441 --> 01:30:54.061
<i>That's Noah Bernstein, my husband.</i>

01:30:54.511 --> 01:30:58.350
<i>He's a doctor. He's really good.</i>

01:30:59.150 --> 01:31:02.119
<i>And that's me, Catherine Brown,</i>

01:31:02.219 --> 01:31:05.556
<i>the new me, lives
in Woodstock, New York.</i>

01:31:05.656 --> 01:31:08.426
<i>The new me is signed
to a small Indie label</i>

01:31:08.526 --> 01:31:10.695
<i>because she hates
the corporate music biz</i>

01:31:10.795 --> 01:31:15.182
<i>and thinks that anyone who takes it
seriously is a ridiculous person.</i>

01:31:15.282 --> 01:31:16.551
<i>But this me...</i>

01:31:16.601 --> 01:31:19.704
This is so much more
than I could have hoped for.

01:31:19.804 --> 01:31:22.173
<i>The me that's finally living her life,</i>

01:31:22.273 --> 01:31:24.975
<i>remembers what her dad would always say,</i>

01:31:25.075 --> 01:31:28.493
<i>"Never sell out. Always put love first.</i>

01:31:28.512 --> 01:31:30.592
<i>And if all else fails,</i>

01:31:30.692 --> 01:31:33.029
<i>there's always Woodstock."</i>

01:31:35.436 --> 01:31:39.982
<i>They're coming over on the wind</i>

01:31:42.442 --> 01:31:49.198
<i>They're coming over
playing horns and violins</i>

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:54.939
<i>The saints and sinners
are all marching back in</i>

01:31:55.039 --> 01:31:58.056
<i>To lead me on</i>

01:31:58.876 --> 01:32:01.297
<i>Lead me on</i>

01:32:02.413 --> 01:32:06.898
<i>I've been walking round in a haze</i>

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:16.876
<i>I have wasted all my nights
and all my days</i>

01:32:18.596 --> 01:32:24.079
<i>I've been lying to myself</i>

01:32:25.719 --> 01:32:32.326
<i>I've been trying to be someone else</i>

01:32:32.776 --> 01:32:35.646
<i>It's so simple now</i>

01:32:35.696 --> 01:32:40.681
<i>It's no secret how</i>

01:32:41.685 --> 01:32:44.555
<i>Follow the river</i>

01:32:45.105 --> 01:32:47.309
<i>Down to the sea</i>

01:32:48.959 --> 01:32:52.871
<i>Where you're supposed to be</i>

01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:58.585
<i>It's never easy</i>

01:32:58.635 --> 01:33:01.085
<i>That's a fact</i>

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:05.442
<i>Nothing's for certain</i>

01:33:05.492 --> 01:33:09.112
<i>You can't always take it back</i>

01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:13.100
<i>On this sad romantic planet</i>

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:15.736
<i>You might make a pact</i>

01:33:15.786 --> 01:33:18.737
<i>A promise to love</i>

01:33:19.356 --> 01:33:22.409
<i>A promise to love</i>

01:33:23.027 --> 01:33:28.515
<i>But you've got to learn to love yourself</i>

01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:35.712
<i>Then you can try to love somebody else</i>

01:33:39.109 --> 01:33:42.880
<i>I've been trying</i>

01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:45.259
<i>But it's hard</i>

01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:53.073
<i>I've been playing with some shaky cards</i>

01:33:53.173 --> 01:33:56.552
<i>But it's so simple now</i>

01:33:56.633 --> 01:34:00.668
<i>Once someone shows you how</i>

01:34:04.084 --> 01:34:06.821
<i>I follow the river</i>

01:34:07.391 --> 01:34:09.908
<i>Down to the sea</i>

01:34:11.074 --> 01:34:14.660
<i>To where you're supposed to be</i>

01:34:18.081 --> 01:34:21.569
- <i>Yeah, I follow the river</i>
- <i>Follow the river</i>

01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:24.605
<i>Back down to the sea</i>

01:34:25.555 --> 01:34:30.506
<i>That's where you're supposed to be</i>

01:34:31.305 --> 01:34:37.394
