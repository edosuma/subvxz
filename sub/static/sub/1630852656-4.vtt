is really red.
-Hmm.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.363
Yeah. I think Pastor Deb
knows about choir practice.

02:35.446 --> 02:37.031
Shit.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.492
Well, isn't she,
like, sort of new?

02:39.576 --> 02:41.369
Just tell her the last
pastor said it was okay.

Yeah, I don't know.
I don't want...

Ugh. My dad needs help

03:26.497 --> 03:29.500
He has no money,

that's gonna work? Jesus.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.965

over at the Ag College or...

03:36.049 --> 03:39.385

Stop.

You know, I don't do it
for Coop. He could care less.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.404
I do it for me.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.699

get the meatballs,

04:13.920 --> 04:15.171
I gotta go to
RiteSpot Liquors,

04:15.254 --> 04:18.633

more Sternos, so...
-No worries.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.594
-I can totally handle this.
-You got it!

Alright, Nelson,
I'll see you in lab.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.118
I got some nitrifying
bacteria to show you

04:45.201 --> 04:47.996
that's gonna warp your mind.
Alright, get outta here.

04:48.079 --> 04:49.706

with me. Um...

05:03.261 --> 05:05.638
Look, I was wondering if
there's any kind of...

05:05.722 --> 05:09.058
Ag program where you could
send the kids to the farm,

05:09.142 --> 05:11.561
and they work for free.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.229
Always want the kids
to work for free.

05:13.312 --> 05:14.897
-Well, they're young.
-I know.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.482
Well, my first thought
is field studies,

05:16.566 --> 05:18.693
but the problem there is
Professor Jankowski.

05:18.776 --> 05:21.279
-What's his deal?
-Wow!

05:21.362 --> 05:24.365
I cannot believe you
just assumed he was a man!

05:24.449 --> 05:25.742

05:28.119 --> 05:30.079
Well, you're
a good guesser.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.873

underrepresented

05:31.956 --> 05:34.500
in the agricultural
sciences.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.044
I got you there
for a second, didn't I?

05:36.127 --> 05:38.379
-You thought I was
going to give a shit.
-(laughs) I did.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.882
-Don't worry about it.
Take a deep breath.
-Okay.

05:42.216 --> 05:44.635

05:44.719 --> 05:46.637
And Jankowski's deal?

05:46.721 --> 05:49.098
He's a prick, but I've
come up with a workaround.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.350
An extra credit program
for my grad students.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.977
They work your harvest,
and I teach them

05:53.061 --> 05:55.772
about real-world conditions
facing independent farmers.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.982
It's good for your pops,
and it's good for them.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.568
-I mean, that would be amazing.
Thank you so much.
-Yeah?

06:00.651 --> 06:01.944
Alright, then we're
gonna make it happen.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.238
Alright, this is me.
Do I know how
to time it or what?

06:04.322 --> 06:06.074

Reshma! Hi! Hey, um,

20:53.251 --> 20:55.087
thank you for coming. (laughs)

20:55.170 --> 20:57.047
-It's really bad.
-Huh?

20:57.130 --> 20:59.132
It's wine. It was
so crowded at Poppy's.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.842
It's hardly noticeable. It--

21:00.926 --> 21:02.761
You know what? White wine
can get out red wine.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.471
It's actually--
I know it sounds crazy,

21:04.554 --> 21:05.806
-but it--
-Tricia: Sam, I don't think--

21:05.889 --> 21:07.849
No, no, no, it works.
Just gimme a second.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.434
You just take
the little napkins,

21:09.518 --> 21:10.852
get the white wine,
put it in there...

21:10.936 --> 21:13.814
-Oh, Sam,
just please be careful!
-There you go.

21:13.897 --> 21:15.190
Yeah. Oh yeah.

21:15.273 --> 21:17.609
Mm, here it goes.
Yeah-- Oh.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.320
-(groans)
-All gone.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.322
-Wow!
-Yeah.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.659
Yeah, just a little trick
I learned from my,
uh, bartending days.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.745
So, have fun.
It's a really cool party.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.582
Love your Oz rainbow.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.753
(exhales)

21:40.424 --> 21:43.343
-We did it.
-(laughs)

21:43.427 --> 21:45.387
I don't deserve
you, chica.

21:46.513 --> 21:47.848
Hey.

21:48.765 --> 21:50.183
I'm taking this candle.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.270
Dad took cheese.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.564
Tricia:
Um...

21:55.647 --> 21:58.150
Just, you know,
I mean... (laughs)

22:00.027 --> 22:02.738
-Thanks.
-Yeah, you're welcome.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.324
This is your last pillow.

22:06.408 --> 22:08.285
-Tricia: You want it?
-I farted on it.

22:08.368 --> 22:10.704
-(laughs)
-Disgusting.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.082

22:14.166 --> 22:16.626

Yeah. (sighs)
