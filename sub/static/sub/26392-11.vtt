WEBVTT

00:01.131 --> 00:02.089
Cooper!
Cooper!
Cooper!

00:02.132 --> 00:05.309
Cooper!Cooper!

00:05.353 --> 00:08.312
Oh, my God, Claire,
this is so exciting.

00:08.356 --> 00:09.966
I know. Thanks, Mom.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.750
I really appreciate
you guys coming

00:11.794 --> 00:13.056
to my big restaurant opening.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.886
Oh, that. Right. Yay!

00:16.929 --> 00:18.844
But I was talking
about the paparazzi.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.325
Uh-oh,
an unidentified girlfriend.

00:21.369 --> 00:24.198
Who is she? It's Bonnie.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.678
So, what are we
waiting for, anyway?

00:26.722 --> 00:27.810
Uh, Jake.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.116
He's looking for a parking spot

00:29.159 --> 00:30.769
because he refuses
to pay for valet.

00:30.813 --> 00:32.336
Oh, I could've spotted him.
What does it cost?

00:32.380 --> 00:35.470
Hundred bucks?Seriously, Cooper?

00:35.513 --> 00:37.950
Do you have any idea
what stuff costs?

00:37.994 --> 00:39.169
Of course I do.

00:39.213 --> 00:42.868
Most things cost...
one credit card.

00:42.912 --> 00:45.045
Found a spot.

00:45.088 --> 00:47.177
But it's three blocks away,
and I need coins for the meter.

00:47.221 --> 00:49.571
You got coins? Give me coins.Oh.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.268
Why would you not
just pay for valet?

00:51.312 --> 00:53.357
I'll tell you why, Cooper-nicus.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.881
It's a sexy little something
called "compound interest."

00:55.925 --> 00:57.361
You see, ten dollars
saved today,

00:57.405 --> 00:58.580
invested wisely,
can blossom into...

00:58.623 --> 01:00.408
Hey, Jake, I think
you're getting a ticket.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.279
No!

01:02.323 --> 01:04.238
Thank you.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.457
Claire, this is really cool.

01:06.501 --> 01:08.068
What the hell?

01:08.111 --> 01:09.504
What? Uh, what-what's wrong?

01:10.592 --> 01:13.116
None of this is
what I designed.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.206
My stupid boss must've changed
the plans without telling me.

01:16.250 --> 01:19.992
Ugh, bosses, right? Aah.

01:20.036 --> 01:21.429
I mean, I assume.
I've never had a real job.

01:21.472 --> 01:24.127
Hey, Claire. Holy crap!

01:24.171 --> 01:26.216
Cooper James. Hey.

01:26.260 --> 01:27.739
If you don't mind,
I'd love to grab a selfie.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.176
My girlfriend's a huge fan,

01:29.219 --> 01:32.701
and this is gonna make the rest
of her dorm supes jeals.

01:32.744 --> 01:35.573
Oliver, um, what
happened here?

01:35.617 --> 01:37.575
I thought that you said that
I had the lead on this design,

01:37.619 --> 01:39.838
and, and then you went
and changed all my ideas?

01:39.882 --> 01:42.189
Yes. Yeah, we decided
to go back to basics.

01:42.232 --> 01:43.929
But thank you
for being so chill about it.

01:43.973 --> 01:46.715
You know, this is what I love
about working with millennials.

01:46.758 --> 01:50.240
Even the ones on the older side.

01:50.284 --> 01:52.329
Well, I got two tickets:

01:52.373 --> 01:55.245
one for parking
and one for jaywalking.Wow.

01:55.289 --> 01:58.205
Really showed those valet guys
who's stupid.

01:58.248 --> 02:01.382
Wow, Claire,
this place is amazing.

02:01.425 --> 02:03.688
Uh, Jake, maybe don't...Complimenting
my girl here, Coops.

02:03.732 --> 02:05.995
Uh, back off. I mean,

02:06.038 --> 02:07.866
it's so Claire, right?

02:07.910 --> 02:10.304
I mean, all this exposed brick.Jake, none of it
is what I designed.

02:10.347 --> 02:11.566
It's disgusting.

02:11.609 --> 02:13.176
Seriously.

02:13.220 --> 02:16.962
I mean, what kind of idiot puts
an orange tree inside a bar?

02:17.006 --> 02:20.140
Actually,
that's my one idea he kept.

02:20.183 --> 02:22.925
"Orange" you glad he did?

02:25.014 --> 02:26.189
Can we please
just get out of here?

02:26.233 --> 02:28.452
Yes, yes.
Your carriage awaits, milady.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.280
Hey, Jake, I think
your car is getting towed.

02:30.324 --> 02:31.629
No!

02:33.892 --> 02:37.287
♪ Imagine me and you, I do

02:37.331 --> 02:40.290
♪ I think about you
day and night ♪

02:40.334 --> 02:41.813
♪ It's only right

02:41.857 --> 02:44.599
♪ So happy together...

02:57.525 --> 02:58.613
I just... I can't...

02:58.656 --> 03:00.745
I... Mm-mm.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.446
It just
keeps happening.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.274
Okay? Oliver always says

03:07.317 --> 03:08.666
he wants to try
something different,

03:08.710 --> 03:12.235
but then we end up going back
to his same old ideas.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.237
Don't worry, babe.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.760
That restaurant's terrible.

03:15.804 --> 03:17.414
To quote your dad
on our wedding day,

03:17.458 --> 03:20.069
"I give it six months."

03:20.112 --> 03:22.680
COOPER: You know,
Claire, I can relate.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.073
When I was recording
my second album,

03:24.116 --> 03:25.683
I wanted to try some
different styles,

03:25.727 --> 03:27.990
but the label didn't let me
veer away from what was working.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.296
So what'd you do about it?

03:29.339 --> 03:30.645
Well, I put my foot down.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.255
You know, they
wanted my hair long.

03:32.299 --> 03:35.519
I wanted it short,
so I kept it medium.

03:38.087 --> 03:41.221
Looking back, it wasn't as
dramatic as it felt at the time.

03:43.353 --> 03:46.356
You know, maybe I should march
back down to that restaurant

03:46.400 --> 03:48.315
and demand
that Oliver listen to me.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.447
He's probably still there trying
to explain to the waitress

03:50.491 --> 03:52.971
why his hair plugs are bleeding.

03:53.015 --> 03:56.845
Now, now, now, now, now,
now, now, now, now, now,

03:56.888 --> 03:59.630
hold on, Claire. All right?

03:59.674 --> 04:02.416
You have to understand that
Cooper is a celebrity, okay?

04:02.459 --> 04:05.157
And we regular people
can't always play by his rules.

04:05.201 --> 04:06.376
Is this because you got scolded

04:06.420 --> 04:07.856
for walking down
that red carpet?

04:07.899 --> 04:09.858
I wasn't scolded, Claire.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.816
I was tased.

04:13.731 --> 04:16.212
And if you act
too rashly here,

04:16.256 --> 04:18.258
you might lose a steady job
with a good income

04:18.301 --> 04:20.695
that, combined with mine,
has us on track to retire

04:20.738 --> 04:23.045
in 25 to 31 years.

04:23.088 --> 04:26.483
But how can I expect
for things to change

04:26.527 --> 04:28.180
if I don't tell my boss
how I'm feeling?

04:28.224 --> 04:30.052
By facing your feelings head-on.

04:30.095 --> 04:33.708
And then squeezing them down
into a tersely worded e-mail

04:33.751 --> 04:37.189
ending in,
"Let's grab a Corona."

04:37.233 --> 04:39.366
Okay. Hand me the computer.

04:39.409 --> 04:41.368
I just hope
that Oliver gets Wi-Fi

04:41.411 --> 04:43.370
considering how far he lives
up his own butt.

04:43.413 --> 04:45.110
Okay. Okay. No-kay. Okay. Okay.

04:45.154 --> 04:49.027
How about I take the keys
so I can type this e-mail

04:49.071 --> 04:50.290
in "business" English

04:50.333 --> 04:52.422
and not "Roseanne Barr
on Twitter" English.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.734
All right. Let's get started.

04:59.777 --> 05:02.780
Um, dear assclown.

05:04.869 --> 05:08.830
"Dear Oliver."

05:08.873 --> 05:11.398
I would rather wear
razor blade goggles

05:11.441 --> 05:14.270
than look at another one
of your designs.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.360
"I've learned a lot
from your sharp eye,

05:17.404 --> 05:20.581
"but I'd love to discuss
some new designs

05:20.624 --> 05:22.234
that I've been working on."

05:22.278 --> 05:24.933
You wouldn't know a fresh idea
if it popped up in front of you,

05:24.976 --> 05:27.457
like the sad penis you once
accidentally group-texted

05:27.501 --> 05:29.677
our whole staff.

05:31.287 --> 05:34.943
"I would love to soft-pitch you

05:34.986 --> 05:36.727
some new ideas for the company."

05:41.079 --> 05:43.081
Oh, my gosh. Jake,
you're a genius.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.822
Oliver wrote back
to say he would love

05:44.866 --> 05:46.520
to discuss things further
with me.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.870
Wow! See, babe?

05:48.913 --> 05:50.393
I had a feeling
he would respond better

05:50.437 --> 05:52.482
to not being called an assclown.

05:54.615 --> 05:56.225
Well, I am going in early
to prep.

05:56.268 --> 05:57.400
Mwah.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.054
Thanks again
for all your support.Hey.

05:59.097 --> 06:00.098
I'm a human bra, baby.

06:01.709 --> 06:04.320
Hey, Jake. Do you have
a second to chat?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.322
Is it sex-related
or money-related?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.803
I know I'm your go-to
for both, so...

06:08.846 --> 06:10.370
It's... You're not...

06:11.501 --> 06:12.546
It's money-related.Ah.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.592
Ever since I've realized
I've been paying

06:15.636 --> 06:17.028
ten times what it costs
to valet,

06:17.072 --> 06:19.248
I've been thinking,
am I out of touch with money?

06:19.291 --> 06:22.338
Hmm, let's see.
Uh, how many cars do you own?

06:22.382 --> 06:23.644
I don't know.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.515
Yep, you're out of touch
with money.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.389
I grew up in a household
where money was tight,

06:29.432 --> 06:31.782
and now I don't even know
the value of a dollar.

06:31.826 --> 06:34.742
Would you be able to go
over my finances with me?Yes!

06:36.396 --> 06:38.049
Yes!

06:38.093 --> 06:40.400
I mean, yeah, yeah,
that's cool. Yeah.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.881
We can talk numbers and stuff.
You know what I'm saying?

06:43.925 --> 06:45.840
It's cool, though.
Right this way.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.368
What are you guys doing here?

06:52.412 --> 06:53.717
Well, well, you dumbos pay

06:53.761 --> 06:55.719
for all the subscription
services, and we hear

06:55.763 --> 06:58.069
there is a new show on
about horny pirates.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.725
It's called All Hands on Deck.

07:05.773 --> 07:09.472
"Deck"? Oh, man,
I misread that title.

07:14.259 --> 07:17.437
So, what-what
are you guys up to?

07:17.480 --> 07:18.655
Well, I've realized
I want to learn

07:18.699 --> 07:20.962
how to be more responsible
with my money.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.878
Cooper, this binder has graphs
tracking all your spending.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.836
Nerd.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.711
Breakdowns of all your revenue.

07:30.754 --> 07:33.409
Dork.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.541
So...

07:34.584 --> 07:36.717
once you get acquainted
with all that,

07:36.760 --> 07:38.893
then, uh, tonight we can talk
about where we can

07:38.936 --> 07:40.460
make some cuts.

07:43.593 --> 07:47.031
Cooper, if you want
some real-life money tips,

07:47.075 --> 07:48.380
we are the people to help you.

07:48.424 --> 07:49.686
That's right.
As young retirees,

07:49.730 --> 07:51.601
we've mastered the art
of stretching a dollar.

07:51.645 --> 07:53.734
We'll take you to happy hour
and give you some tips.

07:53.777 --> 07:56.563
That'd be awesome.
Thanks. We can take my car.

07:56.606 --> 07:59.435
Or we could each
take one of my cars.

08:00.523 --> 08:03.134
I honestly don't know
how many I have.

08:08.531 --> 08:09.750
And for those reasons,

08:09.793 --> 08:12.013
I really think
that these designs

08:12.056 --> 08:14.276
can help us attract
a whole new batch of clients.

08:16.321 --> 08:19.020
: Oh, I'm sorry.
I was focusing so hard

08:19.063 --> 08:20.674
on making it seem
like I was listening to you

08:20.717 --> 08:22.240
that I didn't hear
a single thing.

08:22.284 --> 08:26.070
Oliver, I want
more creative freedom.

08:26.114 --> 08:28.290
It's what you promised me
when I started here.

08:28.333 --> 08:31.162
Look, I understand
being frustrated at work.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.643
I had to put up with my father
for two whole years

08:33.687 --> 08:36.516
before he died and I
took over the company.

08:36.559 --> 08:39.344
I just need to know
that I'm valued.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.650
'Cause if things don't change,

08:40.694 --> 08:42.652
I don't think
I can keep working here.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.480
Claire, you're super talented.
We're lucky to have you.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.873
But just like my stepmother,

08:45.916 --> 08:48.049
you need to respect
that I'm the boss.

08:49.180 --> 08:52.183
So nothing's gonna change.

08:52.227 --> 08:55.143
I'm afraid not.Hmm.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.841
Okay. Well, um...

08:57.885 --> 09:00.235
then I quit.Whoa!

09:00.278 --> 09:04.021
You can't just quit.
You're not my therapist.

09:04.065 --> 09:06.807
Oliver, you don't deserve
someone like me.

09:06.850 --> 09:09.636
I... I'm a really hard worker,

09:09.679 --> 09:11.115
and I have amazing ideas,

09:11.159 --> 09:12.552
and I'm going to find
a design firm

09:12.595 --> 09:15.337
that appreciates
all that I can do for them.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.992
And now I'm gonna do

09:18.035 --> 09:20.821
what no woman in your life
has ever done:

09:20.864 --> 09:22.953
leave your room satisfied.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.008
So, like, so you-you
quit your job?

09:34.051 --> 09:35.923
Like... like, like...

09:35.966 --> 09:38.229
like, like, quit,quit,
or, like...

09:38.273 --> 09:40.710
like, quit, quit, quit?

09:40.754 --> 09:41.929
Like...

09:41.972 --> 09:45.715
I did. And quit saying "quit."

09:45.759 --> 09:47.848
Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

09:47.891 --> 09:50.764
Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.Look,

09:50.807 --> 09:52.809
I know that you are nervous
about the hit to our finances,

09:52.853 --> 09:54.202
but I had to do it.

09:54.245 --> 09:56.857
: No, I...
Girl, it's fi... it's fine.

09:58.685 --> 10:01.078
Money is just a state of mind.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.906
But also a thing
that you exchange

10:02.950 --> 10:05.039
for food and shelter, so...

10:07.476 --> 10:11.219
Okay. Okay, okay.
Luckily, I am an accountant,

10:11.262 --> 10:13.308
and I have accounted
for everything.

10:13.351 --> 10:14.875
Oh, you're about to pull out
a binder, aren't you?

10:14.918 --> 10:17.355
This binder...

10:18.356 --> 10:19.619
...has a detailed plan

10:19.662 --> 10:22.012
of all of our potential
life-altering scenarios.

10:22.056 --> 10:24.798
Let's see what we got
up in here.

10:24.841 --> 10:27.017
Okay, uh...

10:27.061 --> 10:29.629
"Earthquake," uh,
"surprise triplets."

10:29.672 --> 10:31.674
Ooh.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.371
"I lose my hair."

10:35.373 --> 10:36.897
Ah, here we are.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.639
"One of us quits their job

10:42.163 --> 10:44.339
"Good for you, Claire.

10:44.382 --> 10:46.341
Everything's going
to be okay."

10:46.384 --> 10:48.038
Check.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.953
No, I've... I've
already made a list

10:49.997 --> 10:52.347
of ten design firms
that I want to apply to.

10:52.390 --> 10:55.089
I-I'm actually really
excited about it.Well, so am I.

10:55.132 --> 10:56.699
Uh, "Smile and hug her."

11:04.272 --> 11:06.187
Thank you. I know how
much you hate change,

11:06.230 --> 11:08.189
and so this must
be a lot for you.

11:08.232 --> 11:09.973
It's all good in the hood.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.542
Which is where we'll be
living if we're not careful.

11:15.196 --> 11:18.590
But seriously, Claire, uh, I
just want you to know that, um--

11:18.634 --> 11:21.724
and this is off binder-- uh...

11:21.768 --> 11:23.726
that I love you

11:23.770 --> 11:25.728
and I will support you
no matter what.

11:25.772 --> 11:29.036
Aw. Well, I appreciate
the support.Hey.

11:29.079 --> 11:30.341
I'm a human jock strap, baby.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.567
Are you guys sure it's
okay to be eating here?

11:38.610 --> 11:40.874
I feel bad since they didn't use
any of Claire's designs.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.397
Next financial lesson--

11:42.440 --> 11:44.529
don't make sentimental decisions
about money.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.314
Half-price appetizers are worth
betraying your family.

11:46.357 --> 11:47.576
Mm.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.186
GERALD:
So, we've shown you

11:49.230 --> 11:51.232
the basics of money and
how much things cost.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.277
Now it's time to
teach you how to save.

11:53.321 --> 11:54.539
Mm. That would be awesome.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.193
Stars like me go broke
all the time.

11:56.237 --> 11:58.065
I don't want
to end up like Nicolas Cage,

11:58.108 --> 12:01.198
having to sell my dragon eggs
so I can keep my vampire castle.

12:01.242 --> 12:04.201
Exactly, and the key is
to save money

12:04.245 --> 12:06.073
and then invest it
in a sure thing.

12:06.116 --> 12:07.988
How do you guys go about
saving money?

12:08.031 --> 12:09.598
Uh, lots of ways.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.992
Uh, hitting up happy hours,
only shopping on sales racks,

12:12.035 --> 12:13.776
just constantly
looking for deals.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.735
Like how Bonnie and
I love fancy meals,

12:15.778 --> 12:17.084
but we hate paying for 'em.

12:17.127 --> 12:18.433
BONNIE:
One technique we use is

12:18.476 --> 12:19.869
that Gerald will
fake-propose to me,

12:19.913 --> 12:21.784
and then the manager
comps the whole meal.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.655
Does that free proposal stuff
really work?

12:23.699 --> 12:25.745
Does it work?

12:27.834 --> 12:30.010
What?Bonnie Wheeler.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.794
No!Will you make me

12:31.838 --> 12:33.622
the happiest man
in the world?
Oh!

12:33.665 --> 12:36.016
Yes! Yes, I will marry you.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.849
Oh, what?

12:42.892 --> 12:44.154
Congratulations.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.417
Thank you.
Hey, we'd love some champagne.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.898
Oh, and a tomahawk steak
for my blind son.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.257
Hey, babe.
You're home early.

13:00.301 --> 13:03.130
How was work?Oh, fine.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.045
I see you're still right
where I left you this morning.

13:06.829 --> 13:10.224
Don't know if I should kiss you
or check you for bedsores.

13:10.267 --> 13:11.921
Look, I know

13:11.965 --> 13:14.837
that it has been a month
since I quit my job,

13:14.881 --> 13:16.273
but I had the best day.

13:16.317 --> 13:17.797
I applied for
four more jobs,

13:17.840 --> 13:20.060
I got new prints
for my portfolio,

13:20.103 --> 13:22.279
and-- look-- I...

13:22.323 --> 13:24.499
finally finished
my vision board!

13:26.066 --> 13:27.719
What is that?

13:27.763 --> 13:29.721
It's a vision board.Right.

13:29.765 --> 13:32.507
I'm visualizing all the things
that I want in my life,

13:32.550 --> 13:34.683
including a dream job,
and I am just hoping

13:34.726 --> 13:36.076
that the universe
will provide it.

13:36.119 --> 13:38.513
Ah, cool, cool, cool. Yeah.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.210
It's a...

13:40.254 --> 13:41.646
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.953
Vision boards have tons
of benefits, you know. I mean,

13:43.997 --> 13:46.260
not medical or dental,
but, yeah.

13:46.303 --> 13:50.220
They're... beneficial.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.135
Okay, look, I know
that this is stressing you out,

13:52.179 --> 13:53.876
but my next career move
is a big decision.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.138
I need to be excited about it.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.748
I'm not stressed! I...

13:58.185 --> 14:00.100
It's not...
I'm not.

14:00.143 --> 14:04.365
I'm just gonna, you know,
turn these lights down a titch.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.323
There we go.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.369
There's a reason why God put
the sun in the sky, Claire.

14:08.412 --> 14:09.500
Let's use it.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.896
That's a little crazy,
but okay.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.290
Not as crazy as
spending money on AC.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.770
I'll tell you that.

14:18.814 --> 14:21.382
God made wind, Claire.
Let's use it.

14:21.425 --> 14:24.167
So, uh, any new job
leads? Are we...?

14:24.211 --> 14:26.169
Not yet, but

14:26.213 --> 14:28.041
I am getting a lot of likes
on my Instagram page.

14:28.084 --> 14:31.218
Oh! Instagram likes!

14:31.261 --> 14:32.741
It's nice. Like

14:32.784 --> 14:36.701
enough Instagram likes
to pay the gas bill, or...?

14:36.745 --> 14:37.702
Just check it out.

14:37.746 --> 14:38.921
Ooh, checking.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.010
Checking it out,
checking it out.

14:41.054 --> 14:44.361
Oh, you mean like from, uh,
@Hungry4Feet who wrote,

14:44.405 --> 14:46.537
"Love the designs.
Show me your feet."

14:49.801 --> 14:52.761
Oh, oh, here's another sicko
sliding into your DMs saying,

14:52.804 --> 14:55.720
"You're very talented, and
I'd love to meet with you

14:55.764 --> 14:57.940
if you ever have
any availabilities."

15:00.029 --> 15:01.944
Keep dreaming,
Heather Dean.

15:01.988 --> 15:04.947
What? Wait.
Heather Dean wrote that?

15:04.991 --> 15:06.253
You know that pervert?

15:09.778 --> 15:11.301
Jake, I have been trying

15:11.345 --> 15:13.608
to get an interview with her
this whole time! She's amazing.

15:13.651 --> 15:16.350
She's-she's like... she's like
my "guy who invented Quicken."

15:16.393 --> 15:18.569
Dan Gilbert?!
Write her back!

15:18.613 --> 15:19.831
Tell her you can meet right now!

15:19.875 --> 15:21.268
Okay. Okay.
Yeah!

15:21.311 --> 15:22.530
Okay.
All right.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.619
Oh, my God, I can't
believe this is happening.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.969
Oh.She wants to meet with me?
This is crazy.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.710
Oh, my... I... I... I...

15:28.753 --> 15:30.625
I got to go take a shower.Oh.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.975
Uh, well, uh,

15:33.019 --> 15:35.064
water isn't free, Claire,
so, uh...

15:36.587 --> 15:39.242
God made Febreze.
Let's use it, okay?

15:43.290 --> 15:45.074
Thank you so much for driving.
I just want to be super prepared

15:45.118 --> 15:49.165
for this interview.Yeah, of course.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.993
I was headed this way anyway.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.777
Wait.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.562
What are you doing?
The office is two blocks away.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.390
Just picking up a friend.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.479
Uh, there.
What?

16:01.917 --> 16:03.310
You Maggie?

16:03.353 --> 16:05.747
Uh, Jake?Yup.

16:07.531 --> 16:08.793
What's going on?

16:08.837 --> 16:10.273
Just getting my side hustle on

16:10.317 --> 16:12.188
to support the old income, okay?

16:12.232 --> 16:13.537
This is crazy.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.670
How is this crazy?
I'm supporting your dreams.

16:15.713 --> 16:18.542
Chill out. I'm trying to
protect my five-star rating.

16:18.586 --> 16:21.023
Hey, uh, there's mini
bottles of water back there

16:21.067 --> 16:22.807
if you're thirsty.I'm good.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.896
Ooh. But do
you have gum?

16:24.940 --> 16:27.160
I'm meeting a guy and
hoping to make out.

16:27.203 --> 16:29.989
JAKE:
Oh.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.164
Maggie.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.948
Give her your gum.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.560
But I'm down to my last piece.

16:36.604 --> 16:39.433
Five stars, babe.

16:40.564 --> 16:42.914
Here.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.571
All right, good
luck, Claire.

16:47.615 --> 16:48.572
You're gonna crush
this interview

16:48.616 --> 16:49.573
because you're amazing.

16:51.445 --> 16:52.837
Can we get going here?

16:52.881 --> 16:54.665
My guy's wife is
gonna be home soon.

16:58.713 --> 17:01.020
So, after a month
of hitting up happy hours,

17:01.063 --> 17:02.847
shopping only at
sales racks, and

17:02.891 --> 17:06.242
three fake proposals that really
threw Us Weeklyfor a loop,

17:06.286 --> 17:08.766
thanks to you guys
I have saved

17:08.810 --> 17:10.638
this much money.Holy crap, dude!

17:10.681 --> 17:12.901
If you offered me this much
at a casino,

17:12.944 --> 17:14.729
I'd give you my wife.

17:16.383 --> 17:18.950
Between you and me,
his real price is much lower.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.780
COOPER: Claire.JAKE AND GERALD:
Hey.

17:22.824 --> 17:23.825
How'd your interview go?

17:23.868 --> 17:24.956
Sorry I couldn't
pick you up, babe.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.436
Got caught

17:26.480 --> 17:27.829
on a ride back from LAX.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.439
Sherry's out here visiting
her boyfriend, and, uh,

17:29.483 --> 17:31.093
I didn't have the heart
to tell her

17:31.137 --> 17:32.355
that he's stringing her along.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.270
I mean, if he was
just serious about her,

17:34.314 --> 17:36.577
he would, like, commit.
You know what I'm saying?

17:36.620 --> 17:39.449
More importantly,
how was your interview?

17:39.493 --> 17:43.627
Um, it was amazing.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.629
Heather and I
totally hit it off,

17:45.673 --> 17:49.111
she loves my designs,
and... she offered me a job.

17:50.330 --> 17:53.681
♪ I had a feeling!

17:53.724 --> 17:56.162
Which is

17:56.205 --> 17:57.859
why I pulled out
our fancy champagne

17:57.902 --> 17:59.817
that we've been saving
since our wedding day!

17:59.861 --> 18:01.080
CLAIRE:
Okay.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.473
Thanks, but I didn't
take it.

18:03.517 --> 18:06.346
Oh! Come on.

18:11.046 --> 18:13.570
Won't go.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.006
What-what-what happened, Claire?

18:15.050 --> 18:16.878
It turns out
that Heather used to work

18:16.921 --> 18:18.706
at a crappy firm just like me,

18:18.749 --> 18:21.143
but then she decided
to go out on her own,

18:21.187 --> 18:22.492
and now she's killing it.

18:22.536 --> 18:25.756
And while I was hearing this,
it hit me.

18:25.800 --> 18:29.499
I can either keep helping other
people execute their visions

18:29.543 --> 18:32.154
or I can finally
start executing my own.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.809
So... here goes.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.333
Jake, I want
to start my own company.

18:37.377 --> 18:38.900
And I know that this

18:38.943 --> 18:41.424
is gonna throw a wrench
in our whole life plan, but...

18:41.468 --> 18:42.860
I think it's a great idea.

18:42.904 --> 18:45.646
What's that?

18:45.689 --> 18:47.038
You're ready for this.

18:47.082 --> 18:49.258
While I was at LAX,
waiting for Sherry,

18:49.302 --> 18:51.173
I was scrolling
through your Instagram,

18:51.217 --> 18:53.915
and, Claire, your
stuff is amazing.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.352
You shouldbe doing your
own thing. I mean, look.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.049
Look at your vision board.

18:58.093 --> 19:01.009
Check this out.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.185
There's a woman standing
on top of a mountain.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.187
You clearly want
to be your own boss.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.058
I do. I do.
Yeah.

19:07.102 --> 19:09.060
Um, though the
mountain just meant

19:09.104 --> 19:10.845
I wanted to start
hiking more.

19:10.888 --> 19:13.195
Oh.Mm-hmm.

19:13.239 --> 19:16.242
Well, what about the, uh,
queen looking over her people?

19:16.285 --> 19:18.722
Oh, I just
like her bangs.Oh, come on.

19:18.766 --> 19:21.508
Claire...

19:21.551 --> 19:24.685
what I'm trying to tell you is
that I believe in you, okay?

19:24.728 --> 19:26.687
And, uh...

19:26.730 --> 19:30.212
...as scared as it makes me
to stray away from our plan,

19:30.256 --> 19:32.345
I, uh... I know that some day

19:32.388 --> 19:34.564
this will be a risk
I'm glad you took.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.784
Oh, thank you. Mmm.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.310
And I actually do
have some ideas

19:41.354 --> 19:44.400
of how we can cut back
our expenses even more

19:44.444 --> 19:47.621
until, uh,
I get my company on its feet.

19:47.664 --> 19:50.101
We could, um, make a binder.

19:50.145 --> 19:51.929
Oh. Claire,

19:51.973 --> 19:55.237
your parents are in the room.

19:55.281 --> 19:56.586
Oh.Congratulations.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.066
Thanks, Mom.

19:58.109 --> 19:59.241
Cheers.Cheers.

20:07.989 --> 20:10.644
You know, Claire,
if it helps,

20:10.687 --> 20:12.298
I'd love
to use some of the money

20:12.341 --> 20:14.430
that I've saved this month to
help jump-start your business.

20:14.474 --> 20:15.866
Oh, well,
that's-that's really sweet,

20:15.910 --> 20:17.955
but I would not feel comfortable
taking your money.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.609
She doesn't speak
for all of us.

20:19.653 --> 20:21.002
Honey, think up
a company fast.

20:21.045 --> 20:24.919
Uh, uh, uh...
Netflix for shoes.

20:26.442 --> 20:27.922
To be clear, I'm not just
giving you money, Claire.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.794
I'm making a bet on
a sure thing. Totally different.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.448
Are you saying
you want to invest?

20:32.492 --> 20:34.058
Vests, sweaters.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.843
Wear whatever you want.
You're the boss.

20:36.974 --> 20:39.629
Eh, I like the sound of that.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

20:41.283 --> 20:43.285
and as your husband
and your accountant,

20:43.329 --> 20:45.809
I have to say this is
an incredible opportunity

20:45.853 --> 20:47.246
for you both.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.204
I just have one question to ask.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.814
Yes, Jake,
you can do my company's taxes.

20:50.858 --> 20:53.991
Yeah! Yes!

20:54.035 --> 20:57.125
I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, cool,
cool, you know what I'm saying?
