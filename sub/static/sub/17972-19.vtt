19:54.363 --> 19:55.562
I think I should go.

19:55.564 --> 19:57.030
Friends?

19:57.032 --> 20:00.200
Without benefits.

20:00.202 --> 20:02.485

20:02.487 --> 20:04.420
Hey, fellas.

20:04.422 --> 20:08.825
Listen, I know I let you guys
down and I'm sorry.

20:08.827 --> 20:10.894
Denied.
Screw you, traitor.

20:10.896 --> 20:13.964
Oh, and you, Tim?
What of Tim?

20:13.966 --> 20:16.299
God forgives, I don't.

20:16.301 --> 20:18.484
Would it make any difference
if I gave you all,

20:18.486 --> 20:20.987
my "free beer for a year"
coupons?

20:23.407 --> 20:25.775
It would make
a significant difference.

20:25.777 --> 20:27.310
Well, all right, then.

20:27.312 --> 20:32.382
For the next year,
the beers are on me.

20:32.384 --> 20:34.250
I'm done with beer, anyway.

20:34.252 --> 20:36.386
Hello? Carb city.

20:36.388 --> 20:38.955
Population, my thighs.

20:38.957 --> 20:41.691
What does that mean, Cleveland?
I don't know.

20:41.693 --> 20:43.877
What's happening to me?

20:45.696 --> 20:47.697
