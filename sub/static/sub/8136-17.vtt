00:24.657 --> 00:27.683
Bringing up the rear
are McNamer, Hart,

00:27.761 --> 00:29.388
and a big black car.

00:29.462 --> 00:30.793
First you write
to the Foundation

00:30.864 --> 00:32.229
that someone murdered Danny.

00:32.298 --> 00:34.766
Now you try and knock him out
of the race yourself.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.561
Meet the Eighth Wonder
of the World.

00:40.073 --> 00:42.007
Lee, what do you think
caused the accident?

00:42.075 --> 00:43.599
A clown named Kelly Travis

00:43.710 --> 00:46.338
who was busy hot-dogging
his way up the mountain.

00:47.814 --> 00:50.078
I'm gonna have to
teach you some manners.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.947
KITT, we're slipping!

01:05.331 --> 01:07.663
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight

01:07.734 --> 01:10.066
into the dangerous world
of a man

01:10.537 --> 01:12.232
who does not exist.

01:18.611 --> 01:20.476
Michael Knight, a young loner

01:20.547 --> 01:23.175
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:23.249 --> 01:25.240
the helpless, the powerless,

01:25.318 --> 01:28.515
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:10.896 --> 02:13.559
These are the
weapons of a modern-day gladiator

02:13.633 --> 02:15.760
a participant in
the most rugged sport:

02:15.869 --> 02:17.700
motorcycle racing.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.328
Hey, as far as I'm concerned,

02:19.439 --> 02:21.566
this is all
safety experts' hype.

02:21.674 --> 02:23.198
I've been racing
for five years

02:23.309 --> 02:24.503
without a bad spill,

02:24.577 --> 02:27.068
and all I need is
my trusted helmet.

02:29.048 --> 02:30.242
Duvall!

02:31.718 --> 02:33.618
This is my buddy Kelly.

02:33.686 --> 02:36.450
He's always wanted
his picture on a cereal box.

02:36.523 --> 02:38.252
Well, now he knows how
the cereal feels.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.258
Well, try this,
cornflake.

02:42.262 --> 02:44.093
Come on, come on.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.563
Get your buns
and bikes out there

02:45.632 --> 02:47.156
before they
start without you.

02:47.233 --> 02:48.962
Is it okay to say
"buns" on television?

02:49.068 --> 02:51.036
How's it
feel having a big sister

02:51.137 --> 02:53.162
around at the races
to clean up after you, Kelly?

02:53.273 --> 02:55.537
Hey, have you ever tasted
Sabrina's tuna casserole?

02:55.608 --> 02:57.371
It was a matter of
national security

02:57.443 --> 02:58.671
to keep her out
of the kitchen.

02:58.745 --> 03:01.009
Hey! Have you ever seen
these two guys eat?

03:01.080 --> 03:03.742
Their stomachs are gonna
end up in the Smithsonian.

03:03.816 --> 03:05.977
Kelly, there's
been a lot of criticism

03:06.052 --> 03:07.644
that you've been
hot-dogging lately.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.585
Hey, you call it
hot-dogging.

03:09.656 --> 03:12.056
I call it getting an edge.
I take chances.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.218
How else am I gonna win
against guys like this?

03:14.294 --> 03:15.261
They're good.

03:15.328 --> 03:16.295
The best.

03:16.362 --> 03:17.351
Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:19.332 --> 03:21.732
But tragedy
struck that sunny afternoon

03:21.801 --> 03:24.292
as the racers made their way
up Widow's Mountain

03:24.370 --> 03:27.203
on the last stretch
of the Oakside course.

03:41.854 --> 03:42.912
Wow!

03:43.256 --> 03:45.383
That sure makes me glad
I got KITT's armor

03:45.458 --> 03:46.516
to protect me.

03:46.593 --> 03:47.685
Several of those riders

03:47.760 --> 03:50.194
ended up in the hospital,
Michael.

03:50.263 --> 03:52.663
And young Danny Duvall
was killed.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.289
He was killed?

03:54.734 --> 03:57.703
I saw him race once.
He was a terrific rider.

03:57.837 --> 03:59.634
Since the Foundation's
cosponsoring

03:59.706 --> 04:01.003
this year's competition,

04:01.074 --> 04:04.043
we were really worried
when we got this letter.

04:07.013 --> 04:10.005
This says Danny Duvall
was murdered.

04:10.283 --> 04:11.443
Why? Who wrote this?

04:11.517 --> 04:13.678
I don't know, and there's
no way to trace it.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.618
But even if there's
an outside chance

04:15.688 --> 04:17.553
that the accident
may have been planned,

04:17.656 --> 04:19.055
we have our work
cut out for us.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.387
He means you do.

04:20.459 --> 04:23.918
Particularly since there's an
implication the killer may strike again.

04:23.997 --> 04:27.364
I've programmed KITT with details
of the race and its participants.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.698
So you can review everything on
your way to the Oakside Racecourse.

04:30.803 --> 04:32.771
I know the proceeds
are going to charity here,

04:32.839 --> 04:34.704
but how did
the Foundation get involved

04:34.774 --> 04:36.935
in a tough sport
like motorcycle racing?

04:37.310 --> 04:39.301
Well, you may not
believe this,

04:39.379 --> 04:41.472
but Devon happens
to be quite a fan.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.210
You're right.
I don't believe it.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.584
Well, as a matter of fact,
when he was a boy

04:48.655 --> 04:50.247
he made quite
a name for himself

04:50.323 --> 04:52.223
in the Tourist Trophy Races
in Britain.

04:52.425 --> 04:53.449
Devon?

04:53.526 --> 04:54.515
Devon.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.752
Uh, I'm sorry,
but it's just very difficult

04:56.829 --> 04:58.660
to imagine you in
a little racing outfit,

04:58.731 --> 05:01.063
you know, burnin' rubber
and suckin' up dirt.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.261
Matter of fact,
I was a very keen competitor

05:03.369 --> 05:05.496
in those rough-and-tumbles
in the old days.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.196
They were very stimulating.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.136
Now, several of the racers
from last June

05:11.210 --> 05:13.474
are again competing
in this year's race.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.277
I want you to find out

05:15.348 --> 05:17.407
if there's a murderer
among them, Michael.

05:17.483 --> 05:20.748
And if there is, make sure
he doesn't strike again.

05:23.923 --> 05:26.255
Michael, based on
information April gave me

05:26.326 --> 05:30.023
on motorcycle racing, I must
say I'm completely appalled.

05:30.096 --> 05:31.586
What's the problem,
buddy?

05:31.664 --> 05:33.894
Why is so much
time and money wasted

05:34.000 --> 05:35.297
on a means
of transportation

05:35.401 --> 05:38.700
that has improved very little
since the turn of the century?

05:38.805 --> 05:39.965
I guess a lot of people

05:40.073 --> 05:42.007
just like the feeling
of the open air.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.804
Dust and dirt
is more like it.

05:43.876 --> 05:46.310
If you want wind,
you can simply open a window

05:46.379 --> 05:48.609
without getting
half the roadway in your face.

05:49.882 --> 05:52.749
It sounds like a little
professional jealousy to me.

05:52.819 --> 05:54.047
Jealous?

05:54.120 --> 05:57.021
Of those high-powered
broomsticks on wheels?

05:57.256 --> 05:58.985
Perish the thought.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.425
Let's get an overview
of the track, huh?

06:37.597 --> 06:39.622
Michael, I'm afraid
we'll have more accidents

06:39.699 --> 06:41.166
than we bargained for.

06:41.267 --> 06:43.167
This track is in
no shape for a race.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.704
It's cluttered with debris,
potholes,

06:45.772 --> 06:49.208
large gaping crevices,
and numerous mud puddles.

06:49.308 --> 06:51.469
Sounds like a pretty good
description to me.

06:51.544 --> 06:53.478
You mean that's the way
it's supposed to be?

06:53.546 --> 06:55.173
Yeah, KITT it's like
an endurance test.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.113
They throw everything
but the kitchen sink

06:57.183 --> 06:59.276
at the riders and see
if they get through.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.717
Well, I suppose it's just what

07:00.787 --> 07:02.618
these overbred bicycles
deserve.

07:02.855 --> 07:05.050
Oh, you think you could
take the course, huh?

07:05.124 --> 07:08.560
I really don't care to dignify
that with an answer, Michael.

07:08.628 --> 07:10.061
There's a guy
walking on the track

07:10.129 --> 07:12.120
with the name
Fontaine on his jacket.

07:12.298 --> 07:13.697
Give me what you got on him.

07:16.169 --> 07:19.229
A Wade Fontaine was involved
in that big accident, Michael.

07:19.338 --> 07:23.069
Well, who would know more about the
crash than someone who was in it?

07:30.750 --> 07:33.548
Wade? Hi, the name's
Michael Knight.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.649
Yeah? Good for you.

07:35.888 --> 07:37.788
Yeah, I'm with one of
the race's sponsors.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.586
I'm keeping
an eye on security.

07:39.659 --> 07:40.751
So?

07:40.827 --> 07:43.523
Some questions have come up
about the accident last June.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.928
Last June?
That's old news, man.

07:45.998 --> 07:48.558
Well, maybe to you,
but I'm still learning.

07:48.668 --> 07:51.228
Tell him how you caused
the accident, Fontaine.

07:51.337 --> 07:53.396
They call him the Trickster.
You know why?

07:53.506 --> 07:54.837
'Cause he knows
every dirty trick

07:54.907 --> 07:56.807
in the book and uses them
on the course.

07:57.043 --> 07:59.034
Carstairs,
go soak your head.

07:59.412 --> 08:02.677
He has a way with words,
doesn't he, girls?

08:06.786 --> 08:09.584
It's been a real pleasure
talking to you.

08:17.129 --> 08:19.962
Both those racers were
injured in the accident, Michael.

08:20.032 --> 08:22.398
And I can see why.
They're still fighting.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.299
Looks like there's some
unfinished business

08:24.403 --> 08:25.802
floating around here, huh?

08:26.772 --> 08:28.501
Hi, this is
Roger Floyd...

08:28.574 --> 08:29.802
And Darlena Webster.

08:29.876 --> 08:33.642
...inviting you to join us
this weekend on Talkabout

08:33.712 --> 08:37.409
as we go behind the scenes
at the Oakside Charity Race.

08:37.616 --> 08:38.879
We'll see fast bikes...

08:38.951 --> 08:40.179
And racing hunks.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.984
...competing in this $100,000
winner-take-all event.

08:44.256 --> 08:45.781
This will be
a frantic race

08:45.858 --> 08:48.190
over this
incredibly tough track.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.229
Not an enduro,
not a motocross...

08:50.296 --> 08:51.524
That's right, Roger.

08:51.597 --> 08:54.566
I guess you could call it
a "quasi-motocross. "

08:55.601 --> 08:58.001
I had a hunch
she would say that.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.937
We'll be right back
after this word.

09:02.775 --> 09:04.834
What... what was that
"Quasimoto" business?

09:04.911 --> 09:06.902
You're supposed to
stick to the script.

09:06.979 --> 09:09.209
It was a funny ad lib,
Roger.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.306
You're just mad

09:10.383 --> 09:12.214
because you didn't
think of it yourself.

09:13.019 --> 09:16.216
I happen to be known
for my wit, Darlena.

09:16.589 --> 09:18.648
Well, then you should
recognize a good line

09:18.724 --> 09:20.385
when you hear one.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.661
I... I give up.
I give up.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.128
Uh, Roger, wait.

09:26.632 --> 09:29.066
Who's going to do
the commercial tag?

09:36.208 --> 09:38.608
I don't criticize your telecasts.

09:38.678 --> 09:41.112
Please don't
castigate my chassis.

09:48.554 --> 09:51.421
Sure, it's ridiculous,
but it brings in the bucks.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.819
I guess your posters
are on more walls

09:53.893 --> 09:54.985
than Uncle Sam's, huh?

09:55.061 --> 09:56.585
No money
in posters anymore.

09:56.662 --> 09:58.152
It's T-shirts now.

09:58.564 --> 10:01.089
I sold almost as many as E.T.
last year.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.657
Came in second
by only 10,000.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.065
No kidding.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.434
And he can't
even ride a bike.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.799
The fans
don't seem to care.

10:09.508 --> 10:10.702
Listen,

10:11.143 --> 10:13.737
Lee, what do you think
caused the accident last year?

10:13.946 --> 10:15.709
Not a what, a who.

10:16.582 --> 10:17.514
Wade?

10:17.583 --> 10:18.550
No.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.677
A clown by the name
of Kelly Travis

10:20.753 --> 10:23.745
who was busy hot-dogging
his way up the mountain.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.518
You know what gets me?

10:25.591 --> 10:27.752
These showboaters are the ones
get the dolls

10:27.827 --> 10:29.954
and electronic games
named after them.

10:30.262 --> 10:32.594
That's where
the big bucks are.

10:32.832 --> 10:36.859
And that's why I say,
"Promotion is everything. "

10:37.103 --> 10:39.663
Yeah, but Kelly
and Danny Duvall

10:39.772 --> 10:41.763
were supposed to
be best friends.

10:42.541 --> 10:44.941
Hey, when you're competing,
and you ride like Kelly,

10:45.011 --> 10:46.444
anything goes.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.013
But take it from me,
showboating's on its way out.

11:19.545 --> 11:22.241
Carstairs, you might as well
stay in your hotel room

11:22.314 --> 11:25.044
'cause you'll be kicking over
when I'm waving at you

11:25.117 --> 11:27.312
from the top of
Widow's Mountain.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.991
That's Kelly Travis,
isn't it?

11:36.128 --> 11:37.425
Who else?

11:37.930 --> 11:39.625
He'll never learn.

11:40.132 --> 11:41.292
Never.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.740
The garage Kelly
Travis has been renting

11:56.816 --> 11:57.805
is up ahead, Michael.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.282
Okay, buddy.

12:04.990 --> 12:07.083
Really, Michael,
look at that.

12:07.159 --> 12:09.127
Those cars are
dead on their wheels

12:09.195 --> 12:12.028
and yet they're forced
to pull those lazy motorbikes.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.225
It's absolutely outrageous.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.292
Maybe now you'll
appreciate me that much more.

12:41.894 --> 12:42.883
Who are you?

12:42.962 --> 12:43.929
Hi.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.725
Sabrina.

12:46.332 --> 12:47.458
I don't know you.

12:47.533 --> 12:48.693
The name is
Michael Knight.

12:48.801 --> 12:51.167
I work for The Foundation
for Law and Government.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.728
Oh, it's always nice
to meet one of our sponsors.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.308
But, uh,
you could have knocked.

12:57.042 --> 12:58.202
Oh, I did.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.605
Oh, well, then,
what are you doing here?

13:00.679 --> 13:03.079
Actually,
I was looking for Kelly.

13:03.149 --> 13:04.480
What is it
that you want?

13:04.617 --> 13:05.982
Just to talk.

13:06.652 --> 13:08.244
About what?

13:08.721 --> 13:10.188
Danny Duvall.

13:10.956 --> 13:14.323
Danny's dead, and there's
nothing left to talk about.

13:15.494 --> 13:18.429
Look, I know you were friends.
I'm sorry.

13:18.597 --> 13:20.622
Danny and I were engaged.

13:20.766 --> 13:22.791
And there's no one
sorrier than I am.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.473
I was hopin' you could tell me
what happened that night.

13:28.541 --> 13:29.633
Why?

13:29.742 --> 13:31.175
We received
an anonymous letter

13:31.243 --> 13:34.235
saying that said Danny's death
wasn't an accident.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.341
Oh, that's ridiculous.

13:36.882 --> 13:38.577
Does Kelly think so?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.778
Why don't we just
leave Kelly out of this?

13:40.853 --> 13:42.320
Well, I've seen
him ride.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.185
He sure can take care
of himself.

13:44.623 --> 13:46.750
Can you tell me
where he is?

13:48.761 --> 13:50.490
He's out on
the highway somewhere.

13:51.463 --> 13:52.691
Thanks.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.475
Michael, I'm picking up
a truck, and two compact cars

14:07.546 --> 14:09.309
but no motorcycles.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.210
He's out here somewhere.

14:22.962 --> 14:23.951
Michael.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.155
I got you, pal.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.130
Piece of cake.

14:35.241 --> 14:36.936
Michael, up ahead.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.285
All right, Kelly,
pull over.

14:53.359 --> 14:54.883
I want to
talk to you.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.881
What are you trying
to pull, big shot?

15:19.952 --> 15:21.442
I thought
it was pretty hot.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.715
Yeah, well, it wasn't,
and neither are you.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.182
Come on, get up.

15:29.695 --> 15:32.095
Come on, get up,
or do I have to pull you up?

15:33.065 --> 15:36.000
You're gonna have to
pull me up, partner

15:36.101 --> 15:38.831
because, you see,
I can't make it alone.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.772
Haven't been able to

15:42.308 --> 15:45.106
ever since that accident
on the mountain.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.929
How can you ride if
it's so painful to stand?

16:03.996 --> 16:06.965
When I'm on the bike,
the pressure's not on my legs.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.660
Isn't there some kind of
surgery that can help you?

16:09.768 --> 16:12.931
Sure, if I want to take
two years out of my life.

16:14.373 --> 16:15.965
You stay away from racing
that long,

16:16.075 --> 16:17.736
you might as well
hang it up.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.611
Anyway, these legs
are the price I pay

16:20.679 --> 16:22.977
for killing
the best friend I ever had.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.047
What if you didn't
kill Danny?

16:30.689 --> 16:33.089
When I was in
third grade, my teacher,

16:33.892 --> 16:37.419
she used to yell at me for
leaning way back in my chair.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.363
But I'd do it anyway.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.988
You know, showing off.

16:43.402 --> 16:46.371
I've been tilting
that chair back ever since.

16:47.639 --> 16:49.231
That day,
I leaned back too far,

16:49.341 --> 16:50.831
and I took
Danny with me.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.641
Kelly, maybe Danny
fell off his own chair.

16:53.712 --> 16:55.179
No way.

16:55.247 --> 16:56.839
He was the best.

16:57.616 --> 16:59.243
I lost control.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.278
That's something
I never did before.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.288
I tell you what,
I'll make a deal with you.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.256
You cool the hot-dogging,

17:06.325 --> 17:09.886
and I'll find out exactly
who's been tilting the chairs.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.789
Michael, this
situation is deplorable.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.765
Unhitch me immediately.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.693
This looks like the place.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.339
Ladies and
gentlemen, we're rolling.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.367
Welcome back to Talkabout.

17:26.444 --> 17:27.707
This is Roger Floyd.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.304
And I'm Darlena Webster.

17:29.381 --> 17:30.780
And we're
talking to you

17:30.849 --> 17:33.340
from the Oakside
pre-race party.

17:33.919 --> 17:34.977
Oh, look, Darlena,

17:35.054 --> 17:37.488
here comes my very good
friend, Lee Carstairs.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.488
Hello, Lee.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.546
Hi.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.320
Lee, is there anything
you'd like to say

17:41.393 --> 17:42.417
about tomorrow's race?

17:42.494 --> 17:43.552
Sure would.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.620
I'd like to announce
that when I win,

17:45.697 --> 17:48.029
I'm donating the entire
proceeds to charity.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.158
Which means
that both the gate

17:50.269 --> 17:52.430
and the purse will
go to a good cause.

17:52.538 --> 17:53.562
You bet.

17:53.672 --> 17:54.866
It's the spirit of giving

17:54.973 --> 17:57.237
that made
this country great, Ralph.

17:57.309 --> 17:58.298
Thank you, Lee.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.377
Thank you.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.571
Lee Carstairs,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.148
Good friend, huh?
He called you Ralph.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.548
I know.

18:18.964 --> 18:20.295
See you later, KITT.

18:20.365 --> 18:21.491
I'll be here.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.806
Oh dear, here he comes again.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.040
It's most
disconcerting when a partner

18:39.118 --> 18:41.245
treats you with
less than respect.

18:43.889 --> 18:45.356
You can talk.

18:47.025 --> 18:48.583
I'm not losing my mind.

18:48.660 --> 18:49.752
No.

18:49.828 --> 18:51.022
But I suspect you may,

18:51.096 --> 18:53.189
if you continue
your ill-fated relationship.

18:54.533 --> 18:55.830
D-Do you think I chose

18:55.901 --> 18:57.664
that female flake
in a flak suit?

18:59.271 --> 19:02.638
Do I have any say in this?
Of course not.

19:02.741 --> 19:04.675
But I have to go
out there every night,

19:04.743 --> 19:06.210
in front of
millions of viewers

19:06.278 --> 19:08.269
and make a fool of myself.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.679
How do you think
it makes me...

19:13.819 --> 19:15.343
I don't believe this.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.911
I'm telling
my life story to a car.

19:40.479 --> 19:41.605
I just thought
it was time

19:41.680 --> 19:44.080
that you and I
kissed and made up.

19:44.216 --> 19:46.707
Wade, there's no reason
to make up.

19:47.286 --> 19:48.719
I'm not having
a fight with you.

19:48.787 --> 19:50.152
I just don't like you.

19:50.222 --> 19:52.622
That's 'cause you never got
a chance to know me.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.386
She's never gonna
get that chance

19:54.459 --> 19:57.087
because unless you go outside,
get some air, and dry out,

19:57.162 --> 19:59.062
we're going to have to
pour you on that bike

19:59.131 --> 20:00.723
tomorrow morning.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.262
Don't.

20:04.269 --> 20:05.327
Yeah.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.766
Thanks. He just
doesn't know when to quit.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.604
Yeah, a lot of people
have that problem.

20:11.677 --> 20:13.372
Like me, for example.

20:13.478 --> 20:14.570
What do you mean?

20:14.646 --> 20:16.580
Sabrina, I think
you're the one

20:16.648 --> 20:18.479
who wrote the letter
to the Foundation.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.215
Hey, come on,
everybody, don't be shy.

20:26.291 --> 20:27.690
Let's boogie, huh?

20:38.270 --> 20:39.635
Go home, Kelly.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.002
You're breaking up
the party.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.042
You've been hanging around my
sister again. Lay off, Wade,

20:44.109 --> 20:46.236
or I'll be breaking you up
on that hill tomorrow.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.744
Oh, yeah!
You've got a lot of guts

20:47.813 --> 20:49.542
talkin' about
that mountain, man,

20:49.615 --> 20:52.880
considering it's where
you killed your best friend.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.120
Kelly, no!

21:01.893 --> 21:04.327
Cool down, pal.
Save it for the course.

21:04.396 --> 21:06.455
Little too much celebrating,
huh, partner?

21:06.531 --> 21:07.498
Yeah.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.227
Okay, come on.

21:18.510 --> 21:19.534
Oh, Kelly.

21:22.047 --> 21:23.605
Oh, Kelly,
are you okay?

21:24.883 --> 21:26.145
It hurts.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.946
Just like when
Danny's bike hit me.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.051
It's my body's
way of remembering

21:31.123 --> 21:32.283
what I did to him.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.688
Thanks for covering it
for me in there.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.519
I owe you one.

21:38.597 --> 21:40.360
No, you don't
owe me anything.

21:40.432 --> 21:42.297
But you owe
yourself something.

21:42.734 --> 21:45.225
You're beginning to sound like
my third grade teacher.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.772
Yeah, maybe she was
a lot smarter

21:47.873 --> 21:49.465
than you gave her
credit for, huh?

21:49.574 --> 21:51.132
Yeah, maybe.

22:04.356 --> 22:06.551
Oh, I can start
breathing again.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.923
I was so afraid you
were going to tell Kelly

22:09.995 --> 22:11.587
that I wrote
that letter.

22:13.198 --> 22:14.392
How did you know?

22:14.533 --> 22:15.727
I didn't.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.528
But after reviewing
all the players,

22:17.636 --> 22:19.103
it didn't take
a psychic to see

22:19.171 --> 22:20.695
who lost the most
after Danny died.

22:20.939 --> 22:22.668
Why did you write it?

22:23.875 --> 22:25.968
Well, after the accident,

22:26.578 --> 22:29.274
Kelly promised me
he would give up racing

22:29.348 --> 22:31.213
and I really
believed him.

22:31.883 --> 22:34.181
But then he started
practicing late at night.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.413
Next thing I knew,
he'd entered this race,

22:37.489 --> 22:39.787
like he was driven
by speed demons.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.722
You don't know
how scared I was

22:42.794 --> 22:44.523
that something would
happen to him again.

22:44.596 --> 22:46.086
Wait a minute.

22:47.165 --> 22:48.291
It sounds like
you think

22:48.367 --> 22:50.392
that somebody was
after Kelly that day.

22:50.635 --> 22:52.603
I know how Kelly rides.

22:53.505 --> 22:56.065
And that day
up on Widow's Mountain,

22:56.208 --> 22:58.836
he was different
right before the fall.

22:59.277 --> 23:01.643
Like something was
wrong with his bike.

23:01.747 --> 23:03.544
But I could never
prove it, because Kelly

23:03.582 --> 23:05.948
had the bike scrapped
right after the race.

23:06.785 --> 23:09.618
Michael, this race is
less than 12 hours away.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.178
I'm so scared.

23:12.657 --> 23:14.352
Look, I made a promise
I'd find out

23:14.426 --> 23:16.155
the truth about
what happened.

23:17.028 --> 23:19.292
I don't back out
on my promises.

23:19.531 --> 23:21.624
I'll tell you
a little secret.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.928
I've got some friends
who work nights.

23:33.011 --> 23:35.479
I can't imagine what
you expect to find, Michael.

23:35.547 --> 23:37.310
We've been over
this footage all night,

23:37.449 --> 23:39.212
and it's not
getting any prettier.

23:39.284 --> 23:41.149
It looks to me like
Kelly's doing fine.

23:41.219 --> 23:43.050
I mean,
he's having fun.

23:43.121 --> 23:44.554
All of sudden,
he loses control.

23:44.623 --> 23:47.922
Isn't losing control par for
the course on a steep incline?

23:47.993 --> 23:50.393
No, not for someone
like Kelly.

23:50.462 --> 23:52.453
I've seen this kid ride
with a physical handicap.

23:52.531 --> 23:54.192
And he handles that
bike like an ace.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.463
Without the handicap,
nothing can shake this guy.

23:58.470 --> 24:01.234
There's got to be something
wrong with the bike.

24:01.606 --> 24:04.234
I just can't seem to
put my finger on it.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.004
Michael, it's morning.

24:10.081 --> 24:11.309
Why don't you
sleep on it, huh?

24:11.383 --> 24:12.372
Get a fresh start.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.850
The answer is
right in front of me.

24:13.919 --> 24:15.147
I am not gonna
quit now.

24:15.220 --> 24:18.121
Maybe it'll look
different after some rest.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.147
You know,
that's a good idea.

24:20.225 --> 24:21.817
I need a new way
of looking at this.

24:21.893 --> 24:24.293
KITT, give me an ECU
on the bike.

24:26.431 --> 24:27.864
All right.

24:27.933 --> 24:30.333
Now move it forward,
step by step.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.402
That's what's
been bothering me.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.339
Kelly's front wheel
isn't moving.

24:37.409 --> 24:39.206
Doesn't that defy
the law of physics?

24:39.277 --> 24:41.006
It does in my data banks.

24:41.079 --> 24:42.512
If something jammed
his wheel,

24:42.581 --> 24:44.981
he couldn't handle that bike,
no matter how good he is.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.210
Where are you going?

24:46.284 --> 24:47.979
To make sure his
bike is okay this time.

24:48.053 --> 24:49.452
But what about
the sleep?

24:49.521 --> 24:50.954
Sleep? It's morning.

25:45.677 --> 25:47.474
Looks like we're
not the only ones

25:47.546 --> 25:48.706
interested in Kelly's bike.

25:48.780 --> 25:50.270
Let's get him!

26:19.611 --> 26:22.307
Michael, I'm afraid I'm
not equipped for this terrain.

26:22.380 --> 26:23.642
I have inadequate traction.

26:23.715 --> 26:25.808
Nothing we can do
about it, buddy.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.272
KITT, we're slipping!

26:51.343 --> 26:54.278
I told you, Michael,
I'm not equipped to...

27:07.525 --> 27:08.651
KITT.

27:10.662 --> 27:12.289
KITT, talk to me.

27:14.032 --> 27:15.590
KITT, you all right?

27:15.667 --> 27:17.931
I've never been
so humiliated in my life,

27:18.036 --> 27:19.799
watching that
two-wheeled tarantula

27:19.904 --> 27:20.996
run circles around me.

27:21.106 --> 27:23.597
I told you my tires
had no traction.

27:23.708 --> 27:25.903
We'll talk to
April about it.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.237
What about
that tarantula?

27:28.747 --> 27:29.839
Anywhere in sight?

27:29.914 --> 27:32.940
I'm afraid he's quite
literally left us in the dust.

27:33.018 --> 27:34.349
All right. Give me Devon.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.653
Well, KITT, I hope
this will do the trick.

27:39.724 --> 27:42.784
But don't use them unless
it's absolutely necessary.

27:42.861 --> 27:44.829
If it'll save me
further embarrassment,

27:44.896 --> 27:46.158
it's necessary.

27:47.298 --> 27:48.595
You know what I think?

27:48.667 --> 27:49.656
What?

27:49.768 --> 27:51.895
I think the murderer
was really after Kelly.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.369
I think Danny was
an innocent victim.

27:55.306 --> 27:57.103
Now all I've got to do
is figure out

27:57.175 --> 27:59.370
how the wheel was
frozen and who did it.

27:59.911 --> 28:01.674
I don't understand it.

28:01.780 --> 28:04.908
I mean, we all wanted to win
our rough-and-tumbles.

28:05.617 --> 28:08.245
But it's inconceivable to me
that anyone

28:08.319 --> 28:09.718
would want to kill to win.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.986
Somebody was obviously
more desperate than you were.

28:13.058 --> 28:14.582
Whom do you
suspect at this point?

28:14.659 --> 28:15.648
I don't know,

28:15.727 --> 28:17.490
there's two racers
who still hate Kelly.

28:17.562 --> 28:19.792
One's name is Wade Fontaine.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.923
The other is Lee Carstairs.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.091
But I'm not sure

28:23.201 --> 28:24.725
either one's got
a motive for murder.

28:24.836 --> 28:27.066
Carstairs was badly injured
in the race last year.

28:27.172 --> 28:28.969
I doubt any murderer
would include

28:29.040 --> 28:30.007
himself in the package.

28:30.141 --> 28:32.234
He also said that
he'll give all the money

28:32.310 --> 28:33.277
to charity if he wins.

28:33.411 --> 28:34.639
So he's not after money.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.010
What about Fontaine?

28:36.081 --> 28:38.049
Fontaine thinks
that Kelly stands

28:38.116 --> 28:39.777
between him
and Sabrina.

28:39.851 --> 28:42.012
Of course,
he thinks I do, too.

28:42.087 --> 28:43.281
All right.

28:43.354 --> 28:44.946
The high-traction
drop-downs are ready.

28:45.023 --> 28:46.854
But I haven't had
a chance to test them.

28:46.925 --> 28:48.722
There's only one way
to test them.

28:48.793 --> 28:50.055
Use 'em.

28:51.262 --> 28:52.729
I'm out of here.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.498
Something
about Widow's Mountain

28:57.602 --> 28:59.968
and what Sabrina said
keeps coming back to me.

29:00.038 --> 29:02.029
I'd rather we
forget the whole incident.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.732
Yeah, well, we can't.

29:04.342 --> 29:06.367
It's the idea that
every motorcyclist

29:06.444 --> 29:08.071
has distinctive moves.

29:08.146 --> 29:09.704
KITT, I noticed something

29:09.781 --> 29:11.009
about that rider
this morning.

29:11.082 --> 29:12.982
How quickly
he lost us, I suppose.

29:13.051 --> 29:14.882
Yeah, well, that's because
we weren't ready

29:14.953 --> 29:16.648
for the mountain, all right?

29:17.021 --> 29:19.319
But he didn't seem
to be too sure of himself.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.187
I'm afraid I don't
understand your point.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.886
That rider

29:23.328 --> 29:24.818
was not a pro.

29:44.682 --> 29:46.047
Hey, Kelly.

29:46.551 --> 29:47.711
How's the bike?

29:47.852 --> 29:49.046
Now it's A-one.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.819
Somebody tried playing

29:50.889 --> 29:52.550
the old sweetening game
on my tank,

29:52.624 --> 29:54.182
feeding sugar into
the gas line

29:54.259 --> 29:55.590
to foul up the engine.

29:55.693 --> 29:58.025
It's a good thing
I checked it out.

29:58.096 --> 29:59.688
Where's Sabrina?

30:00.131 --> 30:02.929
She's getting ready
for the race. What's up?

30:03.034 --> 30:05.628
Right before your
accident last June,

30:06.371 --> 30:09.101
do you remember
your front wheel jamming?

30:09.507 --> 30:11.975
Didn't anybody tell you it's
bad luck to talk about accidents

30:12.076 --> 30:13.043
before a race?

30:13.144 --> 30:15.874
Yeah, yeah, well,
it's a lot worse having them.

30:19.317 --> 30:22.013
All I remember is
seeing Danny go down.

30:24.389 --> 30:26.789
And I see it
over and over again.

30:27.258 --> 30:29.385
How could one rider
cause another rider's

30:29.460 --> 30:30.893
wheel to stop turning?

30:31.329 --> 30:32.660
It's easy.

30:33.298 --> 30:35.061
You just shoot a little
aluminum rod out

30:35.133 --> 30:38.034
of a CO2 target pistol
right into the spokes,

30:38.102 --> 30:41.037
it stops everything cold,
and then it disintegrates.

30:41.105 --> 30:42.629
That happen a lot?

30:42.740 --> 30:45.538
Bicycle racers do it
a lot in Europe.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.436
What are you
asking for, anyway?

30:47.579 --> 30:49.206
You gonna
sabotage the race?

30:49.280 --> 30:50.770
Not a chance.

30:50.915 --> 30:54.078
I was going to make sure
nobody else does, either.

30:59.557 --> 31:01.024
Listen, you don't mind

31:01.125 --> 31:03.923
if I gear up in private,
do you?

31:03.962 --> 31:05.554
I don't do it
as easily as I used to.

31:05.630 --> 31:06.619
Yeah.

31:08.299 --> 31:09.857
Listen, good luck
out there today.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.059
I'm pulling for you, huh.

31:18.509 --> 31:21.171
Hi. I figured you were
inside with Kelly.

31:21.246 --> 31:23.544
I thought I'd wait till you
came out to thank you.

31:23.615 --> 31:24.673
Thank me, for what?

31:24.749 --> 31:26.649
Well, for chasing away
the guy who tried to

31:26.718 --> 31:27.707
wreck Kelly's bike.

31:27.785 --> 31:29.878
Kelly told me all about it.

31:30.488 --> 31:32.979
Sabrina, Kelly didn't know
I chased anybody.

31:35.260 --> 31:38.093
Oh, well, we knew
someone came to our rescue.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.221
Why did you do it,
Sabrina?

31:41.599 --> 31:43.328
I don't know what
you're talking about.

31:43.434 --> 31:45.061
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

31:45.169 --> 31:46.796
Now don't play
games with me.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.600
What's really
going on here?

31:48.706 --> 31:50.196
First you write
to the Foundation

31:50.308 --> 31:51.741
that somebody
murdered Danny.

31:51.809 --> 31:52.798
Then you try
and tell me

31:52.911 --> 31:54.173
that Kelly's
really the victim.

31:54.245 --> 31:57.009
Now you try and knock him out
of the race yourself.

31:57.081 --> 31:58.639
What's going on?

31:58.716 --> 32:00.684
I want my brother alive.

32:01.753 --> 32:05.154
I begged you to find
the murderer, but you haven't.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.157
And if Kelly goes
out on that racecourse,

32:07.225 --> 32:08.715
he's fair game.

32:08.793 --> 32:12.024
And I'm not going to sit by
and let somebody kill him.

32:12.363 --> 32:14.297
You're not in charge
of your brother's life.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.896
He's a big boy.

32:17.001 --> 32:18.935
If this race means
that much to him,

32:19.003 --> 32:20.368
you got no right
to stop him.

32:20.438 --> 32:23.236
He's my brother.
I love him.

32:23.341 --> 32:25.002
That gives me
the right.

32:25.076 --> 32:26.907
That's not fair, sis.

32:27.345 --> 32:29.870
I've got to win
this race for Danny.

32:30.648 --> 32:32.741
You can't stop me, Sabrina.

32:32.984 --> 32:34.144
Not if you love me.

32:35.119 --> 32:36.677
Oh, Kelly.

32:41.359 --> 32:44.726
Come on,
you'll ruin your mascara.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.425
See you at the
racetrack, huh?

32:50.635 --> 32:52.330
At the finish line.

33:25.103 --> 33:26.798
How's the security
business, Knight?

33:26.904 --> 33:28.269
Live and well.

33:28.339 --> 33:29.499
How's
the racing business?

33:29.607 --> 33:30.733
Just talked to my agent.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.470
Got a new promotion.
Carstairs cycle.

33:33.544 --> 33:34.909
Great idea, huh?

33:34.979 --> 33:36.310
I get the feeling
you could sell

33:36.381 --> 33:37.405
just about anything.

33:37.482 --> 33:39.712
You can't make
a living just winning races.

33:39.784 --> 33:42.651
Believe me, it's those
endorsements that count.

33:43.688 --> 33:44.882
I'll see you.

33:44.956 --> 33:46.685
I've got to beat
the crowds to the track

33:46.758 --> 33:48.521
so I can walk the course
before the race.

33:48.593 --> 33:49.924
Good luck.

33:55.066 --> 33:56.431
Hi, hotshot,
come here, man,

33:56.534 --> 33:57.831
I've got a bone
to pick with you.

33:57.935 --> 33:59.664
Oh, nothing like
a good night's sleep

33:59.771 --> 34:00.999
to mellow you out,
right?

34:01.105 --> 34:02.197
Oh, yeah?

34:02.273 --> 34:04.241
Hey, listen man,
what's between Sabrina and me

34:04.342 --> 34:05.400
ain't none
of your business.

34:05.510 --> 34:08.034
Well, I don't think it's
any of your business, either.

34:08.112 --> 34:09.204
She's not interested.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.248
Yeah, she was
until you came along.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.577
I doubt that.

34:13.317 --> 34:14.511
Hey, listen, stretch,

34:14.585 --> 34:16.610
I'm gonna have to
teach you some manners.

34:18.456 --> 34:21.983
Gee, I hope you can ride
with that bad hand today.

34:27.364 --> 34:28.353
Come.

34:28.433 --> 34:31.333
Meet the Eighth Wonder
of the World.

34:41.478 --> 34:42.775
The discovery of a car

34:42.847 --> 34:44.507
occurred some years ago,
Roger.

34:44.982 --> 34:46.279
Yes,

34:46.451 --> 34:49.351
but this car talks.

34:53.623 --> 34:54.886
Go ahead.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.126
Say a few words
to my cameraman.

35:01.466 --> 35:03.832
I guess it's not
in a talkative mood.

35:05.069 --> 35:07.469
Come on, metal head,
say something.

35:13.144 --> 35:14.702
But yesterday, I just...

35:14.812 --> 35:16.370
Would you, I... I,
what happened...

35:17.415 --> 35:18.677
Traitor!

35:21.285 --> 35:22.650
That's show biz.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.945
Good
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

35:25.022 --> 35:26.990
Welcome to
the Oakside Charity Race.

35:27.058 --> 35:30.357
We need all the riders
to the starting area, please.

35:30.661 --> 35:32.424
I'm Larry Huffman,
we're expecting

35:32.497 --> 35:34.260
some exciting
racing this afternoon

35:34.398 --> 35:37.094
with top riders like
Kelly Travis, Lee Carstairs,

35:37.201 --> 35:39.362
and Wade Fontaine
all here today.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.597
And they are ready to go
for the champagne,

35:41.706 --> 35:42.798
glory, and gold.

35:42.907 --> 35:44.670
The top riders from
across the country

35:44.742 --> 35:46.835
gathered here on
a beautiful afternoon.

35:46.911 --> 35:49.778
The temperature in the 80s,
we've got a fast track,

35:49.847 --> 35:52.907
and we are set for some
very exciting racing.

36:01.425 --> 36:04.019
Hi, and welcome back
to Talkabout.

36:04.095 --> 36:05.892
We're at
the Oakside Charity Race,

36:05.963 --> 36:07.863
which is about to
begin any minute.

36:07.932 --> 36:10.696
Yes, and Roger will be
giving you a blow-by-blow

36:10.801 --> 36:12.996
while I race myself
over to the finish line

36:13.104 --> 36:15.902
to give the lucky first-placer
a great big victory kiss.

36:17.141 --> 36:20.133
Uh, no, Darlena, I'm scheduled
to be at the finish line.

36:20.211 --> 36:21.644
Oh, no, Roger,

36:21.712 --> 36:23.805
do you really think that
these awesome athletes

36:23.881 --> 36:26.441
are going to want
a victory kiss from you?

36:26.517 --> 36:28.417
You've gone too far
this time, Webster!

36:28.486 --> 36:29.817
Oh, slow down!

36:30.254 --> 36:31.414
Cut, cut.

36:31.489 --> 36:34.014
Tough doughnuts, Floyd.
Look, it's done.

36:34.091 --> 36:36.082
And now the whole
country's expecting me

36:36.160 --> 36:38.185
to be
at the finish line.

36:40.364 --> 36:43.561
You're going
the wrong way, bimbo brain.

36:43.668 --> 36:46.068
I've got to
change my attire.

36:46.137 --> 36:49.265
You don't expect me
to be seen in this old thing?

36:52.944 --> 36:55.310
I was doing
Shakespeare before this.

36:55.980 --> 36:58.676
Here, coming
out now, is Kelly Travis.

36:59.350 --> 37:00.544
The line is looking at him.

37:00.651 --> 37:03.620
He's a showboater,
and the crowd likes him.

37:03.654 --> 37:05.121
In the middle of
the front line,

37:05.189 --> 37:06.781
Kelly Travis, Number 25.

37:06.857 --> 37:08.119
The equipment
may have changed,

37:08.192 --> 37:10.683
but the raw excitement
remains the same.

37:11.596 --> 37:12.995
I rather miss it.

37:13.130 --> 37:14.688
Hi.
Hi.

37:14.765 --> 37:16.596
Michael, you still
look worried.

37:16.667 --> 37:18.532
Maybe we should
postpone the race.

37:18.769 --> 37:20.464
No, all I've got
is a feeling.

37:20.571 --> 37:22.232
That's not enough
to cancel all the work

37:22.340 --> 37:23.898
that's gone into this.

37:24.008 --> 37:25.669
No, of course not.

37:26.110 --> 37:29.637
I think it's time to give
the officials the green light.

37:31.148 --> 37:32.672
Why is Kelly doing that?

37:32.750 --> 37:35.241
Ah, it's his style.
Getting attention.

37:35.486 --> 37:37.420
It seems like
an awful lot of trouble.

37:37.488 --> 37:39.581
Well, what they call it
is promotion.

37:39.657 --> 37:41.454
It's the name
of the game around here.

37:41.525 --> 37:43.083
Without it...

37:43.160 --> 37:44.593
Wait a minute.

37:44.962 --> 37:47.226
Promotion.
That might be it.

37:47.298 --> 37:48.287
What do you mean?

37:48.366 --> 37:49.458
I'll talk to you later.

37:49.567 --> 37:52.331
Young gladiators
of racing up on the line now.

37:52.436 --> 37:55.269
You've got to wonder what is
going through their minds.

37:55.339 --> 37:57.102
Number 6, Lee Carstairs,

37:57.174 --> 37:58.539
is certainly
one of the favorites.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.474
Next to him,
Number 11, George Carter.

38:00.578 --> 38:03.206
Then Number 25.
That's Kelly Travis.

38:03.247 --> 38:05.112
A lot of people have
turned out for him.

38:05.182 --> 38:07.412
Number 30,
the incredible Scott Crosby.

38:07.485 --> 38:10.318
Then on the outside,
Wade Fontaine.

38:10.388 --> 38:13.380
Fontaine eyes this star
at the starting area.

38:13.457 --> 38:14.981
And again, very important,

38:15.059 --> 38:17.254
the start for
a race such as this.

38:19.664 --> 38:21.427
There's the start!

38:34.011 --> 38:35.979
Out in front,
down the long straightaway

38:36.047 --> 38:37.639
is Kelly Travis, Number 25.

38:37.715 --> 38:40.183
Running in
second spot, Carstairs,

38:40.251 --> 38:42.116
as they fly over
the giant jump,

38:42.186 --> 38:44.484
catapulting themselves
into the stratosphere.

39:03.474 --> 39:05.374
Michael, I've
been watching the race

39:05.443 --> 39:06.740
and have come
to the conclusion

39:06.811 --> 39:08.278
that there's
very little difference

39:08.346 --> 39:10.405
between motorcyclists
and lemmings

39:10.481 --> 39:11.778
jumping off cliffs.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.180
Right now, I need
your attention

39:13.250 --> 39:14.945
on something
a little less hairy.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.145
I want you to access

39:16.220 --> 39:17.949
Lee Carstairs'
agency contracts.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.286
Every time I interface
with agency computers,

39:20.358 --> 39:22.223
I come away wanting
to count my circuits.

39:22.293 --> 39:23.260
Must I?

39:23.327 --> 39:25.795
Yeah, just do it. I think
I found a motive here.

39:25.863 --> 39:27.660
In that case,
I'll take a chance.

39:30.401 --> 39:32.596
Out in front, side by side,

39:32.703 --> 39:35.570
Kelly Travis, Lee Carstairs,
and Wade Fontaine.

39:35.639 --> 39:37.106
Into the turn now,

39:37.208 --> 39:38.937
and it's still
Travis in front.

39:39.009 --> 39:41.637
Carstairs,
Fontaine, watch out!

39:41.712 --> 39:45.011
Holy Toledo!
Carstairs and Fontaine crash!

39:45.082 --> 39:46.743
No, it's Fontaine down.

39:46.884 --> 39:48.579
Carstairs moves into second.

39:48.652 --> 39:49.710
Fontaine is up.

39:49.787 --> 39:51.414
Apparently okay, but shook-up.

39:58.629 --> 40:00.324
Just what I thought, KITT.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.457
Every one of Lee's
endorsement contracts

40:02.533 --> 40:03.591
ends this year.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.328
I don't
understand the connection.

40:05.436 --> 40:06.664
Lee said it himself.

40:06.771 --> 40:08.739
Those endorsements
are his bread and butter.

40:08.839 --> 40:10.830
Without them,
he can't make ends meet.

40:10.941 --> 40:13.000
What does that have
to do with this race?

40:13.077 --> 40:15.204
Lee has to win
to reestablish himself

40:15.279 --> 40:16.268
as a champion,

40:16.347 --> 40:18.781
or no advertiser
is going to touch him.

40:18.849 --> 40:21.374
Kelly's the only rider
equal to Lee.

40:21.819 --> 40:25.346
I'll bet you Lee got caught up
in his own sabotage last year

40:25.423 --> 40:26.822
and Danny got
the worst of it.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.415
Are you going
to stop the race?

40:28.492 --> 40:31.859
That's like stopping
a stampede. No, KITT.

40:32.163 --> 40:33.994
You and I have
just become the first

40:34.064 --> 40:36.328
four-wheeled
motorcycle team in history.

40:36.867 --> 40:39.700
Let's try those
high-traction drop-downs.

40:46.510 --> 40:48.171
And it seems
there's no separating

40:48.245 --> 40:49.269
Travis and Carstairs

40:49.346 --> 40:51.439
as they continue
to share the lead

40:51.515 --> 40:54.006
as they have since
the beginning of the race.

41:05.663 --> 41:07.858
Michael, I'm
developing a modicum of respect

41:07.932 --> 41:09.024
for these motorcycles.

41:09.099 --> 41:10.760
This is rather hard
on the frame.

41:10.868 --> 41:13.268
The bones don't have it
any easier, pal.

41:19.243 --> 41:20.210
Looks like I've got

41:20.311 --> 41:21.972
a little challenge
for you, partner.

41:22.046 --> 41:23.343
I hate to do this to you.

41:23.414 --> 41:25.678
That's all right, Michael.
It's for charity.

41:25.749 --> 41:27.944
Hold on,
we're going through.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.143
Hey!

41:31.288 --> 41:32.778
That was great!

41:33.424 --> 41:35.756
Maybe we do have
a future as a racing team!

41:35.826 --> 41:37.726
Heaven forbid, Michael.

41:41.632 --> 41:44.567
Bringing up
the rear are McNamer, Hart

41:46.070 --> 41:48.038
and a big black car.

43:06.984 --> 43:08.713
Michael, my sonar indicates

43:08.786 --> 43:10.481
that water is much deeper
than it looks.

43:10.554 --> 43:13.022
Let's not find out
how deep it is.

43:35.079 --> 43:38.105
Michael, Carstairs is aiming
that device at Kelly.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.145
Carstairs will be
out of commission

43:45.222 --> 43:46.211
for a while.

43:52.329 --> 43:53.728
Michael, Kelly has stopped

43:53.797 --> 43:55.128
at the foot of
Widow's Mountain.

43:55.199 --> 43:57.565
He must have lost
his nerve, KITT.

44:00.404 --> 44:02.872
You've got to get
up that mountain.

44:03.607 --> 44:04.801
I can't.

44:04.942 --> 44:06.136
Listen to me!

44:06.343 --> 44:08.368
What happened last year
wasn't your fault.

44:08.512 --> 44:10.537
It was Lee Carstairs'.

44:11.649 --> 44:12.980
I'm sorry.

44:13.851 --> 44:15.443
Without Danny

44:15.886 --> 44:18.218
I feel too alone
going up there.

44:18.822 --> 44:20.380
You won't be alone, Kelly.

44:20.457 --> 44:21.788
I'm going with you.

44:24.395 --> 44:27.091
Michael, the other racers
are only 20 seconds behind.

44:27.164 --> 44:28.631
All right, KITT.

44:28.699 --> 44:30.860
Let's see what those
high-traction drop-downs

44:30.968 --> 44:32.162
can really do, pal.

45:09.940 --> 45:13.569
Kelly Travis, Number
25, riding the race of his life!

45:23.187 --> 45:26.350
Look, this is my show, buster,
so don't tell me what to do.

45:26.423 --> 45:28.357
I'm gonna go right
down here on the line,

45:28.425 --> 45:30.825
so that I can be
the first to see the winner.

45:37.668 --> 45:40.136
Let's see that
on instant replay.

45:45.943 --> 45:47.137
You did it, kid.

45:47.211 --> 45:48.439
No, we did it.

46:00.891 --> 46:03.951
Well, Michael, the race
was a complete success.

46:04.061 --> 46:06.529
The proceeds far exceeded
Devon's expectations.

46:06.597 --> 46:07.757
Great.

46:08.031 --> 46:10.397
Too bad Kelly had to
forfeit his win

46:10.501 --> 46:12.162
because he had help.

46:12.269 --> 46:15.568
Well, I think he won far more
than just a race yesterday.

46:15.639 --> 46:17.607
Yeah, I guess our little
last minute entry

46:17.708 --> 46:18.675
didn't hurt too much.

46:18.776 --> 46:21.244
No, as a matter of fact,
I've had dozens of calls

46:21.345 --> 46:23.711
from promoters
begging for KITT's services.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.043
Don't tell him that.

46:25.115 --> 46:26.673
It'll go straight
to his head.

46:27.217 --> 46:28.149
Hey.

46:28.218 --> 46:29.207
Hey.

46:29.419 --> 46:32.183
Oh, we wanted to thank you
for everything, Michael.

46:32.289 --> 46:33.916
And I want you
to have this.

46:33.991 --> 46:36.983
I've decided that I'm
going to have that surgery.

46:37.060 --> 46:38.857
Then I'm gonna try
and find something else

46:38.929 --> 46:40.692
to put my energies
into besides racing.

46:40.764 --> 46:42.493
Well, I hope
they can stand you.

46:42.566 --> 46:44.227
You've got
a lot of energy.

46:44.334 --> 46:46.427
Thank you very much,
really.

46:46.537 --> 46:47.504
Bye-bye.

46:47.938 --> 46:48.927
Take care.

46:49.106 --> 46:50.130
Bye, April.

46:53.277 --> 46:54.301
It's something, huh?

46:54.444 --> 46:55.468
Pretty nice.

47:03.487 --> 47:05.887
You know, these races
have sparked my interest

47:05.956 --> 47:07.514
in fresh air
once again.

47:07.591 --> 47:10.424
Well, I'll see you
later at the Foundation.

47:13.964 --> 47:15.124
Wow!

47:17.234 --> 47:18.201
Whoo!

47:38.388 --> 47:40.549
Honestly, the fact
that Devon would choose

47:40.624 --> 47:41.886
that two-wheeled can opener

47:41.959 --> 47:44.086
over the comfort
of an automobile

47:44.161 --> 47:46.152
is completely mystifying.

47:48.632 --> 47:50.657
You may have
a point there.

47:59.509 --> 48:01.067
I think we should
demonstrate

48:01.178 --> 48:03.544
the superiority of
a four-wheeled machine.

48:03.580 --> 48:05.172
Michael, you wouldn't.
