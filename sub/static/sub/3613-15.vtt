00:19.311 --> 00:21.563
Oh, God. Not another aftershock.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.900
At least they're getting smaller.
What was the main one, 4.3?

00:25.067 --> 00:27.944
- Radio said 4.5.
- There you go, Grams.

00:29.613 --> 00:32.991
- Earthquakes give me the jeebies.
- Would that be the Phoebe-jeebies?

00:33.158 --> 00:35.660
Oh, you know, the comedy stylings
of Prue Halliwell.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.954
The only Halliwell that
actually likes earthquakes.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.832
I don't like them, but I don't go
running through the house naked,

00:40.999 --> 00:42.667
screaming, "Run for you life," either.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.961
Okay, that is such an exaggeration.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.881
I was wearing slippers.

00:48.048 --> 00:51.301
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Does anybody smell that?

00:51.468 --> 00:54.304
Yeah. I caught a whiff of it
first thing this morning.

00:54.471 --> 00:57.098
- I think it's coming from the basement.
- Gas leak?

00:57.265 --> 00:59.350
I don't know. I called someone
to come and check.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.561
They should be here any...

01:01.728 --> 01:04.272
Now. I'll get it.

01:06.191 --> 01:09.068
- We're never gonna pull this off.
- Everything's gonna be fine.

01:09.277 --> 01:11.196
Yeah, until the house blows up.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.865
Look, this Buckland's VIP
specifically requested

01:14.032 --> 01:15.408
for the dinner party to be here.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.911
Now, Claire may have prodded me
into agreeing.

01:18.119 --> 01:21.414
- But the point is, I did agree and...
- Nothing has changed.

01:21.623 --> 01:24.125
Piper's gonna cook a feast.
I will serve with grace.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.002
And Claire will kiss your ass.

01:26.210 --> 01:27.920
- Tronomical talents.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.505
Morning, ladies.

01:29.672 --> 01:31.132
Wow, that's the smell.

01:31.841 --> 01:33.343
Doesn't really smell like gas.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.887
Yeah. But if it is,
we can't light the stove.

01:36.095 --> 01:37.430
No stove. No dinner.

01:37.638 --> 01:41.142
Relax. I can have it cooked
at the restaurant and brought here.

01:41.350 --> 01:43.269
Well, let me check it out,
see what's up.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.938
Great. Thanks.
The basement is thataway.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.191
Okay. Thanks.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.489
Look, Phoebe. He's going
into the basement. Alone.

01:55.948 --> 01:57.199
Don't even start.

01:57.408 --> 02:00.870
What if, dare I say it,
the bogeyman gets him?

02:01.370 --> 02:04.624
I believe Phoebe
pronounced it "Woogyman."

02:04.790 --> 02:07.084
Or was that just the buckteeth?

02:07.293 --> 02:08.836
Okay, I was 5 years old, you guys.

02:09.044 --> 02:11.380
Oh, so, what, now you're over it?

02:11.547 --> 02:14.675
Which is, I guess, why you haven't
been down there in what, 18 years?

02:14.884 --> 02:17.094
Okay. You guys were not there.

02:17.261 --> 02:20.014
- It was real. It was this...
- A story.

02:20.222 --> 02:22.683
Grams told you she got rid
of the Woogyman in the basement

02:22.850 --> 02:24.310
so you could sleep better.

03:02.514 --> 03:04.224
What the...?

03:07.019 --> 03:09.354
You have freed me.

03:09.521 --> 03:13.984
And now you'll help
take back the house.

03:21.575 --> 03:24.077
Who is Chanda Lier?

03:24.244 --> 03:26.246
Oh, that's me. I ordered some CDs.

03:26.413 --> 03:29.583
Using a fake name
to score some free CDs?

03:29.750 --> 03:31.168
Isn't that a little dishonest?

03:31.585 --> 03:33.920
Phoebe's dark side
rearing its ugly head?

03:34.129 --> 03:36.006
I do not have a dark side,
thank you very much.

03:36.173 --> 03:37.674
Just because I protect the innocent,

03:37.841 --> 03:40.218
doesn't mean I have to be innocent
all of the time.

03:40.427 --> 03:41.636
Oh, I don't know.

03:41.845 --> 03:44.389
Still believing in the Woogyman
is pretty innocent.

03:44.556 --> 03:45.891
And it's very cute too.

03:46.057 --> 03:48.768
You didn't think it was so cute
when we were all sharing a room

03:48.935 --> 03:50.145
and she kept you up all night.

03:50.353 --> 03:53.940
It was scary and it was real.

03:55.859 --> 03:57.652
So, what's the verdict?

03:57.819 --> 03:58.987
Bad.

03:59.195 --> 04:02.073
Bad as in destroying
my entire dinner party?

04:02.240 --> 04:04.200
Or bad as in you can fix it quickly,

04:04.367 --> 04:06.494
it'll just cost more than
my entire education?

04:06.703 --> 04:10.957
By tonight, there will be
no more problems.

04:15.295 --> 04:17.380
Okay. I'm off.

04:17.547 --> 04:19.841
I gotta go too.
I'm going to the wine store.

04:20.007 --> 04:22.302
- Here, for you.
- Thanks.

04:34.272 --> 04:36.649
Which one do you want?

04:37.150 --> 04:39.944
I'll just be upstairs if you need me.

04:46.909 --> 04:49.620
Phoebe.

06:52.993 --> 06:54.995
A little down on the left.

06:56.079 --> 06:57.455
Thanks.

07:00.166 --> 07:02.752
So was this your first quake?

07:02.961 --> 07:06.631
And hopefully my last.
I prefer my ceilings above me.

07:06.798 --> 07:08.258
All right.

07:08.425 --> 07:10.802
This is the final guest list for tonight.

07:11.010 --> 07:13.263
All important clients to me,
to Buckland's,

07:13.471 --> 07:15.598
and therefore to you.
And at the top of the list...

07:15.807 --> 07:18.309
Professor Whittlesey.
Didn't she just buy the Calder?

07:18.518 --> 07:21.980
Well, her family did, and they can
afford to buy much, much more.

07:22.147 --> 07:25.316
And for whatever reason,
she's fascinated with your house,

07:25.483 --> 07:27.902
so your job is to keep her happy.

07:28.069 --> 07:31.322
Excuse me. Claire, I will be bringing
a guest, if that's all right.

07:31.489 --> 07:34.325
Of course. Prue, tonight's going to be
five plus one.

07:35.118 --> 07:37.537
- It's your home, then.
- Yeah.

07:37.745 --> 07:40.623
Oh, Prue Halliwell,
Professor Whittlesey.

07:40.790 --> 07:42.875
Beth. I can't tell you how excited I am

07:43.042 --> 07:46.254
to be spending the evening
in a house with such history.

07:46.421 --> 07:48.881
I understand you know a lot
about the Halliwell history?

07:49.090 --> 07:51.759
I'm better versed on the
house's structure than its inhabitants.

07:51.926 --> 07:53.511
The professor's tenured at Berkeley.

07:53.678 --> 07:55.179
Architectural history.

07:55.346 --> 07:59.267
As a matter of fact, I use your house
as an example in one of my lectures.

07:59.433 --> 08:03.062
Really? Do you mention the leaky roof
and the limited hot water?

08:03.271 --> 08:08.234
Oh, the original house that stood
on that spot was a masterpiece.

08:08.401 --> 08:10.820
But it had to be rebuilt
after the earthquake of 1906

08:10.987 --> 08:12.488
when it was completely destroyed.

08:12.697 --> 08:14.615
That's the time my great-grandparents
moved in.

08:14.824 --> 08:18.995
Metaphysicists believe the land
to be what they call a spiritual nexus.

08:19.161 --> 08:22.456
But it's still standing
after this morning's rumble.

08:22.623 --> 08:24.667
So okay, gotta go. Gotta go.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.877
See you at 7.

08:27.044 --> 08:29.255
Plus one.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.888
<i>- Hello?
- Hey. How's my favourite sister?</i>

08:38.347 --> 08:41.933
You want something.
I know you want something.

08:42.101 --> 08:45.437
<i>Look, my boss just told me
it's plus one. I am so sorry.</i>

08:45.604 --> 08:49.108
Plus one? But I've already
bought the...

08:49.275 --> 08:52.903
Oh, whatever. You owe me.

08:59.368 --> 09:00.994
Excuse me. That's...

09:01.161 --> 09:03.872
Calera Jensen, '93. Last bottle.

09:04.248 --> 09:06.500
- Mine.
Look, why don't you try this.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.127
It's got a robust flavour.

09:08.293 --> 09:09.753
Good nose. Great vintage.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.880
It's probably better than the Calera.

09:12.089 --> 09:13.132
I'm impressed.

09:13.298 --> 09:15.050
But why do you want it so bad?

09:15.259 --> 09:17.052
Because it's got a great body.

09:19.596 --> 09:20.931
<i>Look, I'm making coq au vin,</i>

09:21.098 --> 09:23.058
and I need that bottle
more than you do.

09:23.267 --> 09:26.853
Look, I'm sorry, but I've already been
to three wine stores,

09:27.020 --> 09:31.566
lunch break is long over, and I was told
that this was the bottle to get.

09:32.401 --> 09:34.403
- Told?
- The woman who recommended this

09:34.569 --> 09:36.113
grew up on a vineyard,

09:36.363 --> 09:38.782
and she does know
how to choose wine.

09:38.990 --> 09:41.284
Yeah. Well, I grew up in a house
with two sisters,

09:41.451 --> 09:42.994
and I know how to do this:

09:44.746 --> 09:47.666
I can't... I can't use my powers
for personal gain.

09:47.874 --> 09:51.378
But it's not really personal gain exactly.

09:54.005 --> 09:57.175
Damn! You can keep the wine.

10:14.776 --> 10:16.778
Help me!

10:19.197 --> 10:21.616
- Help me!
- Where are you?

10:21.783 --> 10:24.369
Please. Help me.

10:33.753 --> 10:37.090
- What's wrong?
- I fell.

10:37.257 --> 10:39.008
I think I might have sprained
something.

10:39.175 --> 10:42.929
My ankle.
I could really use a hand down here.

10:43.596 --> 10:45.181
Right.

10:45.348 --> 10:47.600
A hand.

10:47.767 --> 10:50.728
Okay. I'm okay.

10:51.729 --> 10:54.232
I'm coming!

10:55.858 --> 10:57.318
Grams?

10:57.485 --> 10:59.612
Phoebe! Go on back to bed, honey.

10:59.779 --> 11:01.656
Go on.

11:06.911 --> 11:08.162
The Woogyman.

11:11.999 --> 11:15.378
You know, I think I'm just gonna call
somebody for some help.

11:15.544 --> 11:16.921
No, please.

11:17.088 --> 11:19.340
I need your help.

11:21.926 --> 11:23.511
Okay.

11:37.191 --> 11:38.984
Hello?

11:47.076 --> 11:48.869
Where are you?

11:51.747 --> 11:53.499
I thought you said that you were...

11:53.999 --> 11:57.544
Phoebe.

11:58.879 --> 12:00.005
No.

12:00.214 --> 12:03.050
Your nightmares are true. I exist.

12:03.258 --> 12:04.843
I'm a good witch.

12:05.052 --> 12:07.262
- You can't take me.
- You'll fight me at first.

12:07.429 --> 12:13.769
But in the end,
you'll do everything I ask.

12:22.861 --> 12:25.572
Don't worry.
I can handle it all myself.

12:25.739 --> 12:29.409
It's me, the culinary pachyderm.

12:30.452 --> 12:35.499
Phoebe? Maybe we should call
someone to check the electricity too.

12:39.670 --> 12:42.214
Kit? Hey!

12:42.756 --> 12:44.800
Pheebs?

12:54.017 --> 12:57.395
Oh, God! Oh, God, you scared me.

12:57.562 --> 12:59.856
Is everything okay with the house?

13:00.065 --> 13:02.609
- It will be.
- Good. Could I get a ETA?

13:02.776 --> 13:05.237
Because I'm gonna have
one very stressed out sister.

13:06.238 --> 13:07.906
Have you seen my sister?

13:11.034 --> 13:13.036
Phoebe!

13:14.162 --> 13:15.246
Phoebe!

13:25.006 --> 13:26.257
Phoebe. He just...

13:26.466 --> 13:27.967
It's okay. It's okay.

13:28.426 --> 13:29.677
I thought he was gonna kill me.

13:29.844 --> 13:32.138
I didn't even have a chance
to freeze him.

13:32.305 --> 13:34.390
Where did you get the bat?

13:35.475 --> 13:38.937
I don't know. It just sort of appeared.

13:39.145 --> 13:42.482
What do you mean, it appeared?
You opened the closet and found it?

13:42.649 --> 13:45.068
Or appeared like you thought bat
and there it was?

13:45.234 --> 13:46.486
Yeah. Door number two.

13:47.236 --> 13:49.238
I can't explain it,

13:49.405 --> 13:52.742
but something weird happened to me
down in the...

13:52.950 --> 13:56.162
What? Phoebe, spill.
How did you make the bat materialise?

13:59.248 --> 14:02.919
Safety first. Witchcraft later.
We gotta call 911.

14:03.086 --> 14:05.838
- This doesn't track.
- What's that?

14:06.005 --> 14:08.549
I just got background on the gasman.
He doesn't have a record,

14:08.716 --> 14:10.885
not even a parking ticket.

14:11.052 --> 14:14.430
He's a family man, church volunteer,
Little League coach.

14:14.597 --> 14:17.183
<i>When Good Coaches Go Bad.
Next week on Fox.</i>

14:17.350 --> 14:19.185
- Andy, what's going on?
- Everything's fine.

14:19.352 --> 14:21.604
An incident involving the gasman
checking your house.

14:21.771 --> 14:23.397
He got a little rough with Piper.

14:23.564 --> 14:25.066
Prue.

14:28.069 --> 14:30.905
Hey. Piper, are you okay?
Are you hurt?

14:31.113 --> 14:32.782
No. Yeah, I'm fine.

14:32.948 --> 14:34.617
He attacked me.

14:34.784 --> 14:37.453
And then Phoebe stopped him.

14:38.913 --> 14:40.081
Go on, show her.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.625
I told you, I can't do it now.

14:42.833 --> 14:44.043
Do what?

14:44.251 --> 14:47.421
Phoebe has a new power.
She thinks of something,

14:47.588 --> 14:49.507
and, poof, it appears.

14:49.715 --> 14:51.467
I just did it once.

14:51.675 --> 14:54.678
And it saved my life.
I would think that you would be thrilled.

14:54.845 --> 14:57.139
You've always wanted an active power.

14:57.348 --> 14:58.974
Whatever.

14:59.183 --> 15:00.517
Wait a second. Timeout.

15:00.684 --> 15:04.438
Our powers are supposed to progress,
not grow at random.

15:04.605 --> 15:06.023
And if it did grow, I would think

15:06.190 --> 15:09.777
that it would be at least be
premonition-esque.

15:11.737 --> 15:14.239
<i>I smell Book of Shadows.
Did you do something?</i>

15:14.448 --> 15:17.034
Okay, I just saved Piper's ass.
Where were you?

15:17.242 --> 15:19.787
- Phoebe.
- Prue's just pissy because this time

15:19.953 --> 15:21.955
she didn't get to play
Wonder Woman.

15:22.998 --> 15:26.126
I'm not in the mood
to soothe your ego.

15:31.673 --> 15:33.550
Well, tonight's gonna be fun.

15:33.717 --> 15:38.013
She'll be fine.
And everything will be fine.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.363
Thanks for my new power.

15:55.572 --> 15:57.824
You must not fail me again.

15:57.991 --> 16:02.162
You must use your powers
against your sisters.

16:02.370 --> 16:05.248
Please don't make me do this.

16:06.708 --> 16:08.251
I don't wanna hurt them.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.754
Phoebe,

16:10.962 --> 16:15.717
you are not strong enough
to fight me.

16:28.396 --> 16:32.442
It is almost time, Phoebe.

16:36.237 --> 16:40.492
Use the powers.

16:46.789 --> 16:47.957
Flour.

16:48.124 --> 16:51.377
Hey, there is lava water spewing
from the showerheads.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.087
Did you turn up the
water heater again?

16:53.463 --> 16:55.506
No. No, I...

16:58.134 --> 17:01.512
All right. The earthquake must have
messed up the wiring or something.

17:01.679 --> 17:04.473
Try cooking a feast when
your own kitchen is attacking you.

17:04.682 --> 17:07.977
Okay, just relax.
We still have an hour before...

17:09.228 --> 17:11.189
It's 7:00? How can that be?

17:11.396 --> 17:14.608
The clock on the microwave says...

17:17.153 --> 17:18.738
Something weird is going on.

17:18.945 --> 17:20.489
Is anyone gonna answer that?

17:22.532 --> 17:24.201
Phoebe?

17:25.077 --> 17:26.704
Wait. Am I seeing things,

17:26.871 --> 17:28.831
or did you just come
from the basement?

17:28.998 --> 17:30.499
What about the Woogyman?

17:30.708 --> 17:33.669
That was just a story, remember?

17:33.836 --> 17:36.505
You should probably
finish getting ready.

17:43.304 --> 17:45.347
Welcome to Halliwell manor.

17:45.556 --> 17:49.769
My name is Phoebe.
I'll be your cruise director this evening.

17:57.276 --> 18:01.030
Everything is fine. This is fine.

18:03.282 --> 18:05.534
This is utter disaster.

18:05.701 --> 18:09.788
I am a good person.
What did I do to deserve this?

18:09.955 --> 18:12.374
Prue told me to give this to the chef.

18:13.667 --> 18:14.877
You.

18:15.085 --> 18:18.881
Most people call me Josh. I...

18:19.882 --> 18:21.842
I work for Professor Whittlesey.

18:22.050 --> 18:23.260
You're the plus one.

18:23.469 --> 18:26.680
And I stole your wine.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.223
Truce?

18:28.432 --> 18:30.434
Calera Jensen. What a surprise.

18:30.601 --> 18:32.269
Last bottle.

18:32.436 --> 18:34.396
You have...

18:34.605 --> 18:36.440
...flour on your... Right...

18:41.695 --> 18:43.322
Perfect.

18:45.532 --> 18:48.201
Are you planning on feeding
the people in the living room?

18:48.660 --> 18:50.787
Of course. I've got...

18:50.954 --> 18:52.706
What have I got?

18:53.040 --> 18:55.542
- What's in there?
- Duck medallions.

18:55.709 --> 18:58.295
But... No, no.
That's supposed to be part of dinner.

18:59.087 --> 19:01.465
Okay. Now I guess it's an appetiser.

19:01.631 --> 19:04.134
Okay. Go. Go. Go.
Mingle. Mingle. Mingle.

19:04.342 --> 19:07.679
The manor's been beautifully restored.
Really quite magnificent.

19:07.846 --> 19:10.098
Prue. There you are.

19:10.265 --> 19:11.725
Anyone hungry?

19:11.933 --> 19:13.727
Well, what do we have here?

19:14.519 --> 19:16.771
Duck medallions.

19:18.315 --> 19:20.525
Sans medallions.

19:24.279 --> 19:28.616
That's my sister, the magician.
Usually it's a dove or a rabbit.

19:32.620 --> 19:34.581
Lightly simmering.

19:35.623 --> 19:37.876
Okay. Okay. Okay.

19:38.418 --> 19:41.754
Sabotage. I am being sabotaged.

19:41.921 --> 19:43.965
What seems to be the problem?

19:44.174 --> 19:47.302
There is something terribly wrong
with the house.

19:49.637 --> 19:53.224
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Call a plumber.

19:53.391 --> 19:56.102
This is a complete and total disaster.

19:56.269 --> 19:59.314
Somebody just kill me now
and spare me the agony of cleanup.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.524
Ask and you shall receive.

20:01.733 --> 20:04.360
Everything all right in here?

20:06.612 --> 20:08.448
And people pay you to do this?

20:09.240 --> 20:13.995
Phoebe, could you please escort
Mr Congeniality out of here?

20:14.203 --> 20:15.788
Please, now.

20:17.707 --> 20:20.376
And get Prue.
Tell her it's an emergency.

20:20.585 --> 20:23.462
There's no other house
in the city quite like yours.

20:23.629 --> 20:26.424
- Because of its architecture?
- Because of its location.

20:26.591 --> 20:29.552
Right, you mentioned that. Something
about some sort of a spiritual...

20:29.719 --> 20:32.555
Nexus. It's mythology, really.

20:32.763 --> 20:35.725
But it's believed that when
a geographical point is equidistant

20:35.891 --> 20:40.980
to the five spiritual elements,
it's a place of great power.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.358
Power failure.

20:45.026 --> 20:47.236
Look, I don't know what's going on,

20:47.445 --> 20:51.574
- but I apologise for any inconvenience.
- Prue, Piper needs you in the kitchen.

20:52.450 --> 20:55.828
No, don't worry.
I'll take very good care of your guest.

21:02.501 --> 21:04.712
You came to see the house.

21:04.879 --> 21:07.256
Would you like the grand tour?

21:15.264 --> 21:18.642
Okay, aren't you the same girl
who said, and I quote,

21:18.809 --> 21:21.437
- "Everything will be fine"?
- Yep.

21:21.645 --> 21:24.106
- And?
- It's not. I don't know what it is,

21:24.273 --> 21:26.483
but it's like the house is possessed.

21:26.984 --> 21:29.111
No, no.
It is Phoebe and her new powers.

21:29.611 --> 21:33.740
Look, I know she's been acting
really weird lately, but she wouldn't...

21:33.907 --> 21:37.536
I would argue
if I could think of another option.

21:38.453 --> 21:40.080
Prue?

21:46.378 --> 21:48.213
May I speak to you for a second?

21:48.422 --> 21:50.924
Yes. I'll be out in one second, Claire.

21:52.467 --> 21:53.593
What do we do?

21:53.802 --> 21:57.180
I don't know, but I can't cook this meal.
Not in this kitchen.

21:57.347 --> 21:59.725
And it's too late to get it from Quake.

22:00.225 --> 22:03.311
Okay. Let's just end it now
before it gets any worse.

22:03.478 --> 22:05.439
Be my wingman?

22:13.697 --> 22:15.615
Really, I don't need
to see the basement.

22:15.782 --> 22:17.701
Are you kidding?

22:17.868 --> 22:20.453
It's the best part of the house.

22:20.871 --> 22:22.747
After you.

22:26.459 --> 22:27.752
Well, as hostess,

22:27.961 --> 22:30.297
it's sometimes helpful
to be present at the party.

22:31.965 --> 22:35.760
Claire, I am so sorry, but I'm
gonna have to cut this evening short.

22:35.969 --> 22:38.722
We're experiencing
some technical difficulties.

22:38.930 --> 22:41.516
What?
Do you realise what you're doing?

22:41.725 --> 22:44.018
Yes, and I think I'm doing it
just in time.

22:44.185 --> 22:47.522
There is a table waiting for all of you
at Quake. On the house.

22:47.689 --> 22:50.150
- There is?
- There will be.

22:53.069 --> 22:55.864
- Where's Phoebe?
- I think she's giving the professor a...

22:56.030 --> 22:57.407
Tour.

22:58.533 --> 23:01.786
She showed me the bedrooms,
the solarium.

23:01.953 --> 23:04.539
I found the basement
particularly intriguing.

23:04.747 --> 23:08.293
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

23:08.501 --> 23:12.046
Okay. Dinner has been changed.

23:12.213 --> 23:14.257
We're having it
somewhere else, okay?

23:14.424 --> 23:16.175
Oh, professor.

23:16.718 --> 23:19.095
I'm sorry you didn't get to spend
more time in the house.

23:19.262 --> 23:21.180
My time was well-spent.

23:34.068 --> 23:37.446
I'm looking forward to hearing
your explanation of tonight's events.

23:37.613 --> 23:39.198
- Need a ride?
- I just have to tie up

23:39.365 --> 23:41.867
a few loose ends here.
I'll try and make it.

23:42.034 --> 23:44.161
Try hard.

23:46.706 --> 23:47.832
Now what?

23:47.999 --> 23:49.959
Interrogation.

23:50.126 --> 23:51.669
Are you looking for me?

23:51.877 --> 23:53.671
Why are you doing this?

23:53.879 --> 23:55.881
Because he asked me to.

23:56.090 --> 23:57.383
Who asked you to?

23:59.135 --> 24:00.261
Okay.

24:00.886 --> 24:03.472
That is it. We need to...

24:07.101 --> 24:11.313
Prue. Prue, are you okay?

24:11.480 --> 24:14.567
Phoebe! What's wrong with you?
Why won't you let us in?

24:15.401 --> 24:16.902
No, you can't.

24:18.487 --> 24:20.322
You shouldn't.

24:22.658 --> 24:25.786
You don't live here anymore.

24:26.745 --> 24:28.205
He does.

24:41.510 --> 24:44.972
Okay. We have been up all night.
We've tried everything.

24:45.180 --> 24:48.600
If our powers can't get us
into the house, what can?

24:57.693 --> 24:59.361
That helped.

24:59.569 --> 25:02.948
You know, yesterday I got shocked
when I walked through the front door.

25:03.156 --> 25:06.284
Me too. Do you think that's when
this all started?

25:06.451 --> 25:07.994
Define "this."

25:08.161 --> 25:12.249
Our house has turned against us
and so has our sister.

25:12.416 --> 25:16.586
This is more than just Phoebe.
She said that he told her to do this.

25:16.753 --> 25:19.297
So who is he, and what does he want
with Phoebe?

25:19.464 --> 25:21.842
Maybe that's the problem.
We've been focusing on Phoebe.

25:22.008 --> 25:23.718
Maybe that's not the point.

25:23.885 --> 25:27.681
- Then what is?
- Location.

25:27.847 --> 25:29.891
Whatever has the house has her too.

25:30.058 --> 25:31.893
And it's not letting us in for a reason.

25:32.060 --> 25:34.688
<i>And we can't get to The Book
of Shadows to find out what it is.</i>

25:34.854 --> 25:37.482
- So we know nothing.
- Yes, we do.

25:37.649 --> 25:41.236
There's someone who knows
the house better than we do. Come on.

25:52.205 --> 25:55.542
Yes, I would like a pizza
delivered to my home.

25:55.708 --> 25:59.170
Well, whenever you do open, then.

25:59.337 --> 26:01.839
I don't care what you put on the thing.

26:02.006 --> 26:05.093
Just make sure somebody delivers it.

26:05.552 --> 26:09.097
1329 Prescott Street.

26:09.264 --> 26:11.182
I'll be waiting.

26:20.900 --> 26:23.986
Let's go. Please, ma'am.

26:24.946 --> 26:26.781
Hey! What happened?

26:26.948 --> 26:28.199
I don't know.

26:28.366 --> 26:30.284
Professor Whittlesey
had just begun her seminar

26:30.451 --> 26:33.412
when she turned
and suddenly started choking me.

26:33.579 --> 26:35.748
And if one of her students
hadn't pulled her off...

26:35.957 --> 26:37.416
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

26:37.625 --> 26:39.085
Yeah. I just...

26:39.669 --> 26:41.587
I don't know why
she snapped like that.

26:41.754 --> 26:44.715
Okay. Josh, do you know anything
about what she said to Claire?

26:44.882 --> 26:46.968
It's something about
a spiritual nexus.

26:47.134 --> 26:48.970
She brought that up?

26:49.136 --> 26:51.263
The professor doesn't usually go in
for that sort of

26:51.430 --> 26:53.057
metaphysical mythology.

26:53.224 --> 26:55.810
You know Claire, once she gets
her claws into something,

26:55.976 --> 26:57.353
she can't seem to forget about it.

26:57.520 --> 27:00.022
You know, I've met people like that.

27:01.148 --> 27:05.402
A spiritual nexus is a point
of incredible energy.

27:05.778 --> 27:08.239
Equidistant from the
five spiritual elements.

27:08.405 --> 27:11.575
That's right. A place or thing
that could be swayed either way.

27:11.784 --> 27:14.078
- Either way?
- Yeah. Either to be a source

27:14.245 --> 27:16.539
of undeniable good or undeniable evil.

27:20.834 --> 27:23.128
Ladies, I'm gonna follow her
and make sure she's okay.

27:23.337 --> 27:26.715
Now, feel free to browse around
in our office if you think it'll help.

27:30.511 --> 27:34.431
Okay, to find a way back in, we have to
know what we're up against.

27:34.598 --> 27:38.018
The professor said
that a true spiritual nexus

27:38.185 --> 27:41.063
sits equidistant from
the five basal elements.

27:41.230 --> 27:45.526
So that's earth, fire, water,
wood and metal.

27:45.692 --> 27:49.071
Okey-dokey. Equidistant.

27:49.238 --> 27:51.281
Here is the manor.

27:51.448 --> 27:53.283
All right.

27:55.244 --> 27:56.578
Let's see. The bay, water.

28:01.458 --> 28:03.460
Natural hot springs?

28:03.627 --> 28:04.795
Fire.

28:05.003 --> 28:09.758
What about wood? That park that
Mom used to take us to, Kenwood.

28:09.925 --> 28:13.553
Named after the type of tree that
grew there when it was still a forest.

28:13.762 --> 28:15.263
Okay.

28:16.890 --> 28:18.600
Three out of five. Earth.

28:20.769 --> 28:23.104
Twin Peaks. Highest point in the city.

28:24.272 --> 28:25.857
And last but not least, metal.

28:26.066 --> 28:28.860
- Tiffany's.
- Cute. Natural metal.

28:29.027 --> 28:31.446
Okay. Fourth grade, field trip.

28:31.655 --> 28:33.198
We panned for gold.
Where was that?

28:37.160 --> 28:38.995
Okay.

28:54.344 --> 28:57.097
Our house was built
in the centre of a pentagram.

28:58.264 --> 29:01.893
Looks like it's not just on a
spiritual nexus,

29:02.060 --> 29:04.395
but a Wiccan one as well.

29:05.230 --> 29:07.982
Which means it's a battleground
for good and evil.

29:08.191 --> 29:10.818
And what happens
once evil has the house?

29:11.027 --> 29:12.820
It spreads.

29:13.780 --> 29:15.865
<i>We'd have to check
The Book of Shadows to be sure,</i>

29:16.032 --> 29:19.619
but I'd bet that there's a reason why
our family built the house there,

29:19.786 --> 29:22.163
to reclaim the spot for good.

29:22.372 --> 29:24.832
And now I'm thinking
evil wants it back.

29:25.625 --> 29:27.502
Yeah, and it's taking Phoebe with it.

29:41.140 --> 29:43.935
Why does it feel like we live here?

29:48.439 --> 29:50.399
- Which one you want?
- I'll take that one.

29:50.566 --> 29:53.194
- I could use a change of scenery.
- See you back here.

29:53.361 --> 29:55.446
- Next to you.

29:57.657 --> 29:59.033
Hello, inspector.

29:59.950 --> 30:01.118
Phoebe.

30:01.285 --> 30:03.829
- Hey, I stopped by to...
- Just in time.

30:04.705 --> 30:07.333
I think there might be a gas leak.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.169
And I'm home all alone.

30:11.879 --> 30:14.381
Do you think you could look it over?

30:15.800 --> 30:17.176
Sure.

30:23.057 --> 30:25.351
It's down in the basement.

30:29.897 --> 30:32.483
So he came out of his house,
walked over here

30:32.650 --> 30:34.401
and started throwing things?

30:34.610 --> 30:36.862
No. Not out of his house.

30:37.029 --> 30:38.322
Out of the Halliwells'.

30:38.947 --> 30:40.532
Really?

30:40.824 --> 30:42.493
Hey, Morris, neighbourhood watch?

30:43.786 --> 30:46.371
Had a woman brought into
the station house today.

30:46.538 --> 30:49.708
Wasn't feeling too well,
spent last night at your house.

30:49.875 --> 30:52.753
- Professor Beth Whittlesey?
- Is she okay?

30:52.961 --> 30:55.255
Not at the moment.
She's under observation.

30:55.422 --> 30:56.840
Paul, what is the matter with you?

30:57.007 --> 30:59.051
- Nothing.
- I'm occupied right now.

30:59.218 --> 31:01.511
Andy would like to ask you
a few questions. He's inside.

31:01.678 --> 31:03.680
I told you to keep your trash cans
off my driveway.

31:03.847 --> 31:07.142
Wait. If Andy is in the house
and Paul was in the house,

31:07.309 --> 31:09.853
- there must be a way for us to get in.
- We better hope so.

31:10.020 --> 31:12.606
<i>Otherwise, there's no way to
get to The Book of Shadows.</i>

31:16.818 --> 31:17.944
- Freeze him.
- No, wait.

31:18.153 --> 31:20.113
What are you doing?

31:21.698 --> 31:24.493
- What was that?
- The house is letting him out, right?

31:24.659 --> 31:28.121
This is the only second
that its guard is down.

31:28.288 --> 31:30.457
- You're brilliant.
- Thank you.

31:36.796 --> 31:39.299
Oh, my. She's frozen.

31:39.507 --> 31:41.343
- Good.
- No, no, no.

31:41.509 --> 31:44.304
Remember? Our powers don't work
on good witches?

31:45.055 --> 31:47.557
- Oh, that means she's...
- We've lost her.

31:48.433 --> 31:51.603
Okay. Let's go get her back.

31:52.270 --> 31:53.646
Run.

32:00.153 --> 32:03.198
- I never liked living next door to him.
- Don't do it again!

32:03.406 --> 32:04.741
Wanna give me hand here, partner?

32:04.908 --> 32:06.534
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Andy!

32:11.372 --> 32:12.707
What the hell was that?

32:13.249 --> 32:14.751
What?

32:15.585 --> 32:17.003
I have no idea.

32:19.964 --> 32:21.924
- Faster would be good.
- There is nothing here.

32:22.091 --> 32:23.676
We don't even know
what we're fighting.

32:23.843 --> 32:25.511
- Our sister.
- No, it's more than that.

32:25.678 --> 32:27.930
All right. When in doubt,
start at the beginning.

32:28.097 --> 32:30.016
What happened first?

32:30.183 --> 32:32.560
- Gasman attacked me.
- Before that.

32:32.727 --> 32:34.771
The earthquake, which is why
the gasman was here,

32:34.937 --> 32:36.355
to check the leak in the basement.

32:36.522 --> 32:39.066
All right, and before
Professor Whittlesey freaked out,

32:39.233 --> 32:43.112
she took a tour of the house
including the basement.

32:43.905 --> 32:45.198
Noises don't help.

32:45.364 --> 32:48.367
The gasman said
that's where Phoebe was.

32:48.576 --> 32:50.203
And we know she's been down there.

32:51.120 --> 32:53.122
No. Piper it was just a story.

32:53.331 --> 32:55.499
Are you so sure?
We've seen monsters and demons

32:55.666 --> 32:57.001
from the past and the future.

32:57.168 --> 33:00.421
How can you be so certain that
Phoebe's childhood monster isn't real?

33:00.921 --> 33:03.049
The Woogyman in the basement?

33:03.257 --> 33:04.967
Phoebe swore she saw something
down there.

33:05.134 --> 33:07.553
That's when Grams
started telling us the story...

33:07.720 --> 33:09.263
Of how to destroy it.

33:09.472 --> 33:11.974
And there was an earthquake
that night too, remember?

33:12.141 --> 33:13.309
Maybe that's how it gets out.

33:14.101 --> 33:17.229
We've been looking
in the wrong place.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.690
<i>How to vanquish the demon
isn't in The Book of Shadows.</i>

33:19.857 --> 33:22.276
It's in Grams' story.

33:22.610 --> 33:25.404
So it wasn't a story.
It was a spell?

33:25.613 --> 33:27.656
All right,
the Woogyman is a real demon.

33:27.823 --> 33:30.868
So Phoebe was right.
Now, how did it go?

33:31.035 --> 33:35.080
Something about a Woogyman,
and Grams fought it.

33:35.914 --> 33:39.126
- That's all that you remember?
- Well, don't you remember anything?

33:39.335 --> 33:41.628
I remember that it was
sort of like a rhyme.

33:41.795 --> 33:43.172
Sounded like a children's song.

33:43.380 --> 33:47.885
Well, we'd better figure it out fast,
or we're gonna have a whole lot of...

33:56.810 --> 33:58.437
Prue!

33:58.604 --> 33:59.813
Prue!

34:00.272 --> 34:01.773
- Phoebe?
- Any fantasies

34:01.940 --> 34:03.650
about how you wanna die?

34:03.859 --> 34:06.820
Phoebe, listen to me. This isn't you.

34:07.029 --> 34:09.656
- Give the girl a prize.
- Prue!

34:09.864 --> 34:13.409
Look, whatever is doing this
hasn't completely beaten you.

34:13.577 --> 34:15.286
Otherwise, we would be dead by now.

34:15.495 --> 34:17.331
- Really?
- Phoebe?

34:18.040 --> 34:21.293
- Phoebe, you were stronger than him.
- I mean it!

34:21.501 --> 34:23.462
No, I wasn't.

34:23.628 --> 34:26.047
That's why he chose me.

34:26.214 --> 34:29.134
- But now I'm stronger than you.
- Prue! Phoebe!

34:33.847 --> 34:35.181
Prue!

34:37.641 --> 34:39.436
Go!

34:47.235 --> 34:48.737
Piper, where are you going?

34:48.902 --> 34:51.239
It's just not Phoebe we're fighting.
It's the house.

34:51.447 --> 34:52.741
Piper, don't!

34:54.743 --> 34:55.909
Oh, God.

34:56.786 --> 34:59.456
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not.

34:59.622 --> 35:01.499
Neither are you.
We're locked in this house,

35:01.666 --> 35:03.877
and our sister is trying to kill us.

35:14.304 --> 35:17.682
All right, the answer must be
in Grams' Woogyman story.

35:17.891 --> 35:21.144
- Which neither one of us remembers.
- Yeah, but we have to keep trying.

35:32.238 --> 35:34.073
There has to be a way out of here.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.783
We've tried everything, Piper.

35:35.950 --> 35:39.620
Besides, the only way to help Phoebe
is from inside.

35:40.496 --> 35:42.165
Help her kill us maybe.

35:42.373 --> 35:47.170
- Yeah, well, we have to keep trying.
- Prue! Piper! Help me!

35:48.212 --> 35:49.755
Do you think...?

35:49.922 --> 35:53.217
Please? You gotta help me.
I'm down in the basement.

35:54.635 --> 35:57.597
- Trap.
- Yeah, well, what else can we do?

35:57.805 --> 36:00.099
We could not go to the basement.
I'd vote for that.

36:00.308 --> 36:02.560
Grams must have thought
that this evil might come back.

36:02.727 --> 36:04.687
And that's why she told us the story.

36:04.895 --> 36:08.065
How do we remember the words?
I never believed in the Woogyman.

36:08.232 --> 36:11.193
No, but Phoebe did.
She knows the story by heart.

36:11.402 --> 36:13.446
Something tells me
she's not in the mood to share.

36:13.946 --> 36:19.076
All right. We know that the source
of his power is in the basement.

36:19.243 --> 36:21.620
So if we can weaken him,

36:21.787 --> 36:24.081
then maybe we can weaken his hold
on Phoebe.

36:24.248 --> 36:26.709
At least long enough
for her to tell us the spell.

36:27.084 --> 36:30.296
How do we do that? We don't
even know what it is or how to fight it.

36:30.504 --> 36:32.798
Help! Please, I need you.

36:40.723 --> 36:42.474
Okay.

36:44.143 --> 36:46.854
We have no choice,
so we're gonna need a...

36:47.021 --> 36:48.731
Light.

36:52.276 --> 36:55.404
No. The light.
Grams' story, remember?

36:55.612 --> 36:59.700
She said something about using it
to guide you through the shadow.

36:59.867 --> 37:01.368
Or was it to the shadow?

37:01.577 --> 37:03.829
That doesn't make sense.
Using a light to find a shadow.

37:03.996 --> 37:06.373
Shadows retreat from the light.

37:06.748 --> 37:10.627
And they thrive in the darkness.

37:10.794 --> 37:12.838
Kind of like this.

37:13.005 --> 37:15.841
Or in the basement.

37:16.008 --> 37:19.803
Maybe that's what we're fighting, Prue.
A shadow.

37:20.137 --> 37:21.763
Okay.

37:22.139 --> 37:23.849
Let's fight it.

37:31.022 --> 37:33.024
Phoebe?

37:39.406 --> 37:41.199
Okay. There, see that?

37:47.080 --> 37:49.040
What took you so long?

37:53.086 --> 37:54.963
One evil at a time.

37:55.130 --> 37:57.257
Okay. Freeze it.

37:59.217 --> 38:01.761
It's not working. Can't you...?

38:03.471 --> 38:05.098
No, my powers
aren't working on it either.

38:08.393 --> 38:10.186
Phoebe, you've got to listen to us.

38:10.979 --> 38:13.857
You're in no position
to tell me what to do.

38:14.065 --> 38:17.944
Remember Grams' story? The one
about the Woogyman? About the light?

38:18.862 --> 38:20.780
Come on, Phoebe. Try.

38:22.866 --> 38:25.368
I can't.

38:25.535 --> 38:27.662
Don't make me.

38:27.829 --> 38:29.372
Don't like the basement.

38:29.581 --> 38:33.084
It's no use. Your sister's evil now.

38:33.251 --> 38:35.586
Come on, Phoebe.
You've got to fight it. You're good.

38:39.132 --> 38:42.093
- Grams?
- Phoebe. Go on back to bed, honey.

38:42.260 --> 38:43.970
Go on.

38:50.810 --> 38:53.646
Phoebe, please. Remember the story.
What did Grams say?

38:53.855 --> 38:55.815
Hurry, Phoebe, please.

39:00.194 --> 39:03.281
<i>I am light</i>

39:05.783 --> 39:08.619
<i>I am one too strong to fight</i>

39:09.245 --> 39:13.666
<i>Return to dark
Where shadows dwell</i>

39:13.833 --> 39:16.961
<i>You cannot have this Halliwell</i>

39:17.169 --> 39:18.546
Keep it going, Phoebe.

39:18.754 --> 39:21.716
<i>Go away and leave my sight</i>

39:21.882 --> 39:23.467
What are you doing?

39:23.634 --> 39:26.554
<i>And take with you this endless night</i>

39:26.846 --> 39:29.265
Phoebe, no!

40:15.018 --> 40:16.103
Anybody home?

40:16.353 --> 40:18.272
Office hours aren't until 5.

40:20.274 --> 40:23.277
Piper. What are you doing here?

40:23.485 --> 40:25.946
Oh, I just came by to see how you...

40:26.113 --> 40:28.073
Professor Whittlesey was doing.

40:28.281 --> 40:30.909
She seems better.
Hasn't choked anybody lately.

40:31.118 --> 40:33.537
Good. So you'd say
she's back to normal?

40:33.745 --> 40:36.373
Yeah. Although she's being
censured for her behaviour.

40:36.540 --> 40:40.502
You know, has to sit before
the university board, and for now,

40:40.669 --> 40:42.671
well, it looks like
I'm covering her classes.

40:42.879 --> 40:45.632
Oh, that's too bad. I mean...

40:45.799 --> 40:49.010
- I don't mean you. I mean...
- I know what you mean. Yeah.

40:49.928 --> 40:53.431
You know, by the way,
I have something for you.

41:00.522 --> 41:02.649
Calera Jensen, '93.

41:02.816 --> 41:05.068
Battles have been waged
over this wine.

41:05.235 --> 41:06.861
Not today. I'm too tired.

41:07.570 --> 41:09.447
That's actually very nice.

41:09.656 --> 41:14.160
Don't sound so surprised. You know,
I am capable of a kind act or two.

41:14.744 --> 41:16.704
It's good to know.

41:19.499 --> 41:23.044
So Morris said that it was only
a two-week suspension.

41:23.253 --> 41:25.255
Doesn't seem fair.
It wasn't really Andy's fault.

41:25.421 --> 41:28.633
Well, what was he gonna do,
plead shadowed?

41:28.800 --> 41:30.718
Anyway, everyone seems
to be back to normal,

41:30.885 --> 41:32.637
but that doesn't erase their actions.

41:32.804 --> 41:34.847
Yeah, well, I wish it did.

41:35.014 --> 41:38.142
Get me off of Claire's bad side,
as if she had a good one.

41:38.309 --> 41:40.687
I'm beginning to wonder
if I have a good one.

41:43.690 --> 41:44.983
Well, I am.

41:45.149 --> 41:48.069
I mean, up until now,
I didn't even think I had a dark side.

41:48.236 --> 41:50.655
I mean, not any more so
than anyone else.

41:50.863 --> 41:53.825
Yeah, well, the important thing
is that the good side won out.

41:53.991 --> 41:57.245
Yeah, but I must have been more
susceptible than either one of you.

41:57.411 --> 41:59.872
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
chosen me, right?

42:03.376 --> 42:04.418
Right.

42:04.627 --> 42:06.629
You were the only one
that was born in the house.

42:06.796 --> 42:09.757
That makes you more connected to it.
It's that spiritual nexus thing.

42:09.966 --> 42:12.802
That's exactly my point.
I could go either way.

42:12.969 --> 42:15.554
Good or evil. It's kind of freaky.

42:17.390 --> 42:21.185
I do have to tell you I am gonna
miss that new power, though.

42:21.394 --> 42:23.104
It was so fun.

42:25.314 --> 42:29.735
If Grams put away the shadow
and it came back...

42:29.902 --> 42:31.445
It means he can come back again.

42:33.280 --> 42:34.698
Okay, it's time.

42:36.283 --> 42:38.744
<i>Every witch before us
has added to The Book of Shadows.</i>

42:38.911 --> 42:41.413
We need to warn who comes next.
It's our turn.

42:42.122 --> 42:43.457
Who should do it?
