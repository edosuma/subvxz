Johnny.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.364
What are you looking at?

00:30.489 --> 00:31.741
Who is she?

00:32.950 --> 00:35.828
That's Miss Cindy,
Zeke's new aide.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.830
What happened
to his old aide?

00:37.955 --> 00:39.206
She got married.

00:40.583 --> 00:42.168
So, first,

00:42.293 --> 00:47.173
you want to rub the glue on the paper
in any shapes you like.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.342
Why do people
get married?

00:50.468 --> 00:52.511
Because they
love each other.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.430
Why aren't you married?

00:54.555 --> 00:56.974
I haven't found the person
I love yet

00:57.099 --> 01:00.519
because I spend
all of my time loving you.

01:00.644 --> 01:01.771
(CHUCKLES)

01:02.730 --> 01:04.482
Does that mean
we can get married?

01:04.607 --> 01:05.941
(LAUGHS)

01:06.067 --> 01:11.113
Well, love comes in many types,

Oh, it's pretty.

01:20.915 --> 01:22.583
See, look,
I like the green.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.210

of green snow?

Now I can actually get
some cream cheese.

29-year-old teacher, she works with
special needs children. She...

02:47.710 --> 02:49.461
I love what you're wearing.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.422
It brings out the blue
of the case file.

02:51.547 --> 02:54.383
Which means it's not from the ER.
So why are you here?

02:54.508 --> 02:56.886
Because Dr. Cuddy
is not here.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.555
She's decided to spend some more time
at home with the baby for a while.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.432
I'm taking over some
of her day-to-day responsibilities,

03:01.557 --> 03:03.893
like babysitting you.

03:04.018 --> 03:07.646
Interesting. You have your
whole life ahead of you,

03:07.771 --> 03:10.733
so why would Cuddy
want you to die so young?

03:11.192 --> 03:12.026
She figured I'd spent

03:12.151 --> 03:14.445
three years working for you,
I was inoculated.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.072
Good. Fun.

03:18.073 --> 03:21.160
You get to exercise your newfound power,
I squirm under your thumb,

03:21.285 --> 03:23.954
resent the student becoming the teacher,
and then push comes to shove

03:24.079 --> 03:26.916
and we all get to realize what
our real roles should be.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.168
And then you put out.

03:30.336 --> 03:31.962
That's why
I took the job.

Never thought I'd see the day you
were taking orders from Cameron.

04:00.032 --> 04:01.659
- Cameron's in charge?
- When did that happen?

04:01.784 --> 04:03.535
KUTNER: You're going to
destroy her, aren't you?

04:03.661 --> 04:07.873
I am going to do my job. If that
involves leaving her a rotting pulp...

04:08.165 --> 04:09.875
Cameron's going to
mark her territory.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.085
She'll probably
overcompensate

04:11.210 --> 04:12.795
- and destroy you.
- Bleeding ulcer.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.505
Scope of the stomach
and lungs were clean,

04:14.630 --> 04:18.342
yet she continues to spit up blood
from both her stomach and lungs.

04:18.467 --> 04:20.469
Means there's probably something wrong
with the blood itself,

stop it already?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.687
- Stop what?
- Disagreeing.

04:29.812 --> 04:31.772
Okay. Which one of us shouldn't
have an opinion?

04:31.897 --> 04:34.692
It's not an opinion,
it's a smoke screen.

04:34.817 --> 04:37.695
You toss out a lame idea instead of
agreeing with Foreman's better idea

04:37.820 --> 04:38.946
because you're worried
that will confirm

04:39.071 --> 04:42.741
that he's boldly gone where no man
has gone before.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.660

Apparently, it colors everything.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.630
Now I have no idea if you have
differing opinions

04:56.755 --> 04:57.965
because you have
differing opinions

04:58.090 --> 05:00.968
or because you're just trying to prove
that you can think for yourselves.

05:01.093 --> 05:03.637
How about you just
judge our ideas on their own merit?

05:03.762 --> 05:05.723
(SCOFFS) You don't
want me to do that.

05:06.557 --> 05:09.768
Go run a bleeding time test,
confirm our patient's blood is screwy,

05:09.893 --> 05:12.855
then you can come back and pretend
to disagree about why.

anywhere near this woman.

Not really.

05:38.172 --> 05:42.968
Most kids, typical children, you hand
them a pair of scissors and they cut.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.220
Well, Tony, he's got CP,

05:45.346 --> 05:49.892
and when I gave him scissors,
we went on a journey together,

05:50.017 --> 05:53.604
learning to get his fingers in those
holes, to hold the scissors apart,

05:53.729 --> 05:54.813
to hold the paper.

05:54.938 --> 06:00.652
I mean, when he finally learned to cut,
we both just wept with joy.

boss, just yes or no answers, okay?

06:09.495 --> 06:12.122
It's not slowing up.
No sign of clotting.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.666
So there is something
wrong with my blood?

06:14.792 --> 06:16.418
Don't worry,
we'll run some lab tests

06:16.543 --> 06:18.170
to find out which
clotting factor is off and...

06:18.295 --> 06:20.130
I'm not worried.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.924
Must be one hell
of a happy place.

She's eight weeks old.

06:42.945 --> 06:45.572
Are you asking me about her politics
or her sense of humor?

06:45.697 --> 06:47.783
My cousin had a kid.
They acted like they knew the thing

06:47.908 --> 06:50.786
from the time it was
two minutes old. I just thought...

06:50.911 --> 06:52.913
She cries, she eats,
and she poops.

07:04.466 --> 07:05.843
What's wrong?

(SNIFFLES)

07:08.429 --> 07:09.763

You're tired.

07:13.517 --> 07:14.852
I'm not sleep deprived.

She sleeps fine.
I'm obviously not hormonal.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.279
I know I'm supposed
to feel amazement.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.948
I'm supposed to love her.

I just...

07:31.952 --> 07:33.662
I don't feel
anything at all.

07:37.207 --> 07:40.210
Sorry. Maybe
I'm just tired.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.381
Thank you for stopping by.
I'm okay.

07:44.506 --> 07:45.507
Lisa,

07:46.967 --> 07:48.093
if you're...

07:49.720 --> 07:53.348
I'm feeding her, I'm changing her,
and I'm burping her.

07:53.474 --> 07:57.853
I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do.
She will be okay.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.982
Please go back to work.

08:13.744 --> 08:16.330
It is the blood, but the clotting
proteins aren't the problem.

08:16.455 --> 08:19.208
It's her platelets. Looked like
they had bite marks in them.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.335
So, now you're
agreeing?

08:21.460 --> 08:24.213
Either you folded because I gave you
crap, or you broke up, or...

08:24.338 --> 08:25.923
We disagree,
you blame our relationship.

08:26.048 --> 08:27.799
We agree, you blame
our relationship.

08:27.925 --> 08:28.967
Don't you see
a problem there?

08:29.092 --> 08:31.553
- Yes. Don't you?
- Could be lymphoma.

08:31.678 --> 08:32.930
Not with a normal LDH.

08:33.055 --> 08:35.516
ITP fits. We should
start her on methotrexate.

08:35.641 --> 08:38.519
Absolutely.
And total body irradiation.

08:38.644 --> 08:40.646
Because she failed
the bleeding time test?

08:40.771 --> 08:43.273
TBI will promote cancers,
kill her digestive tract.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.651
Don't forget, stop her
from bleeding into her brain.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.654
It's premature, reckless,
and potentially lethal.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.114
True. Must be somebody's
job to stop me

08:51.240 --> 08:53.200
from being
reckless and irresponsible.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.160
Nobody can stop me
from being premature.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.245
(CHUCKLING)

09:00.415 --> 09:03.877
I got a patient with ITP.
I want to hit her with radiation.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.462
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.381
- Methotrexate.
- Good point.

09:07.506 --> 09:09.633
On the other hand,
if she bleeds in her brain,

09:09.758 --> 09:12.594
she's gonna need
a special ed class of her own.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.681
Fine.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.225
Really?

09:18.350 --> 09:20.102
Yeah. If you think
it's right, do it.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.645
Hmm.

09:21.853 --> 09:25.691
Some people thought you were going to be
brutal, marking your territory.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.693
- Who?
- Nobody.

09:27.818 --> 09:29.987
Just because I call
him nobody, doesn't make me a racist.

09:30.112 --> 09:32.114
I'm not going
to play games.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.659
If you come to me with a request, and
it makes medical sense, I'll say yes.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.912
I need oral sex.

09:40.289 --> 09:44.376
I'm pretty sure biological
imperative qualifies as medical sense.

09:44.501 --> 09:45.961
Can I return
my phone call now?

09:46.086 --> 09:48.630
I don't really see
how that's going to be possible.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.559
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

10:01.768 --> 10:04.730
Patient won't respond to methotrexate,
bleeding time hasn't improved.

10:04.855 --> 10:07.357
You have a medical
dilemma for me, I have one for you.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.860
I need a reason
to not do total body irradiation.

10:09.985 --> 10:11.778
Other than that
Cameron said you can't.

10:11.903 --> 10:12.946
She said I can.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.573
Then why don't
we just do it?

10:14.698 --> 10:17.826
Because it's premature, reckless,
and potentially lethal.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.786
Then why don't we
just don't do it?

10:19.911 --> 10:20.996
Because that would let
Cameron in on the fact

10:21.121 --> 10:22.539
that I never
intended to do it.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.958
This is gonna
be convoluted, isn't it?

10:25.083 --> 10:27.878
Figured I'd ask for something really
crazy so she'd shoot me down,

10:28.003 --> 10:31.381
and get the whole, "I can control House"
thing out of her perky little system.

10:31.506 --> 10:34.301
So the next time I went back and I asked
for something marginally crazy,

10:34.426 --> 10:37.471
it would seem marginally reasonable,
and she'd say yes.

10:37.596 --> 10:40.015
So, yeah,
slightly convoluted.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.642
You're screwed.

10:41.767 --> 10:43.018
Unless we irradiate her.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.063
Without the radiation.

10:46.188 --> 10:48.190
We book the nuclear lab,
we fill out the paperwork,

10:48.315 --> 10:51.652
we bring the patient down there, we do
everything but flip the switch.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.363
Go. Do. Don't flip.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.657
And is there anything
we should be doing,

10:56.782 --> 10:59.201
you know, to actually
help the patient?

10:59.326 --> 11:02.245
Trust me, for the long
term, this will help all our patients.

11:02.371 --> 11:05.832
In the short term, double the dose of
methotrexate and add prednisone.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.588
Cameron's got the keys
to the castle.

11:11.713 --> 11:14.383
This trial I'm running,
the drug really seems to be working.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.843
She's kind of
liking the power.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.804
Think I'm kind of
liking her liking it.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.515
I'm not sure
what I'm going to do about Thirteen.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.600
She's sort of dressing
like Cuddy.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.396
She's on the placebo.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.897
You can't possibly
know that.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.024
Accidents happen.
I found out.

11:35.278 --> 11:39.741
You cannot tell her.
You'd be compromising the trial.

11:40.450 --> 11:43.370
She knows she had a 50-50 chance
of not being on the drug.

11:43.495 --> 11:46.373
If you feel like you're
lying to her, too bad.

11:46.498 --> 11:47.874
I don't want to tell her.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.045
I want to put her
on the real drug.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.507
And you want me to tell you
that that's okay?

11:55.632 --> 11:57.467
Her trial results are already
compromised

11:57.592 --> 11:59.302
just from the fact that I know.

11:59.428 --> 12:00.929
As long as she's
wasting her time,

12:01.054 --> 12:04.891
why not give her something that might
actually help her?

12:05.016 --> 12:09.062
Valid point, except for the fact
that it's a load of crap.

12:11.690 --> 12:12.941
Don't be an idiot.

12:22.701 --> 12:25.954
So, how long until
we start the procedure?

12:27.581 --> 12:30.625
We already started.
Told you, you wouldn't feel a thing.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.963
You should lie back.
Just stay really still.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.715
(CHATTERING)

12:40.177 --> 12:41.887
I have to pee.

12:42.012 --> 12:45.807
Can we, like, call a timeout for a
minute? Let me go to the bathroom?

12:47.809 --> 12:50.812
Yeah. Sure. We 'II just start up
again when you're done.

12:50.937 --> 12:51.938
Thanks.

12:52.063 --> 12:55.192
Sorry. I didn't
realize I had to go.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.777
TAUB: No problem.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.612
(THUDDING)

12:58.737 --> 12:59.780
Sarah!

13:04.993 --> 13:06.787
No pulse.
Get the paddles.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.500
(CHARGING)

13:12.501 --> 13:13.835
Clear!

13:13.960 --> 13:15.170
(THUDS)

13:16.713 --> 13:18.340
(SIGHING) Got a pulse.

13:18.465 --> 13:22.302
It's not ITP. She clearly doesn't
need fake radiation.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.057
No structural defects
in her heart.

13:27.182 --> 13:30.018
THIRTEEN: What about a calcified valve
or a patent foramen ovale?

13:30.143 --> 13:32.187
Transthoracic echo and bubble study
show nothing.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.396
Her heart's clean.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.148
The patient said
she had to go pee.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.692
Maybe when she got up,
she started to urinate,

13:37.818 --> 13:40.529
increased the vagal tone, caused
arrhythmia and stopped her heart.

13:40.654 --> 13:43.615
Who has to go pee in the middle
of a nuclear procedure?

13:43.740 --> 13:45.200
It wasn't really
a nuclear procedure.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.535
She didn't know that.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.248
People don't die
from peeing.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.542
Heavy metal, toxin.

13:53.667 --> 13:54.793
Drugs or alcohol.

13:54.918 --> 13:58.004
Or her own body is making a toxin.
Cold agglutinins.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.674
Abnormal protein gets activated
by cold temperatures.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.342
Like the classroom
with the broken heater

14:02.467 --> 14:03.760
and the cold metal table
in the procedure room.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.595
For God's sake,
get a room.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.098
Immerse her in an ice bath.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.058
The cold will activate
her cold agglutinins.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.268
Causing her heart to race.

14:11.393 --> 14:12.602
Confirming our diagnosis.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.145
And giving her
another heart attack.

14:14.271 --> 14:17.983
Lucky for me, there's a flaxen-haired
maiden who loves to say yes.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.403
(DOOR CLOSING)

14:21.528 --> 14:23.655
How in the world could you approve
total body irradiation

14:23.780 --> 14:25.240
for a patient
with possible ITP?

14:25.365 --> 14:26.408
It was the right call.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.076
There was no medical justification
for that kind of...

14:28.201 --> 14:31.955
Not medically, no. Absolutely no medical
rationalization.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.542
I had to say yes because House
wanted me to say no.

14:35.667 --> 14:36.793
You think he was bluffing?

14:36.918 --> 14:38.670
I'm the new kid,
he had to test me.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.631
Don't get cute,
don't engage him.

14:41.756 --> 14:44.301
Do not play his games
because you will lose.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.469
You hired me to do this job,
let me do it.

14:50.390 --> 14:54.978
Oh! I'm sorry, looks like you guys are
in the middle of a conversation.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.688
I can wait
until Cuddy leaves.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.817
You are gonna
leave soon, aren't you?

15:00.942 --> 15:03.737
I mean, the nurses have got
your baby out there.

15:03.862 --> 15:06.615
Not that they're
going to kidnap it or anything,

15:06.740 --> 15:08.909
but I figured that
the new mother brings the baby to work

15:09.034 --> 15:10.827
because she wants
to listen to all the cooing.

15:10.952 --> 15:13.079
If you're gonna wait,
you can wait outside.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.707
Unless the new mother
brings the baby to work

15:15.832 --> 15:18.627
because she wants
to dump the baby,

15:18.752 --> 15:23.089
because she hates the baby and
thinks she made a big mistake.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.803
You can't trust
that Wilson guy with anything.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.139
Lisa, are you...

15:31.264 --> 15:33.642
It's not a big deal,
I was having a bad day.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.852
Is Wilson gonna
be in trouble?

15:35.977 --> 15:38.813
For betraying my trust
in a vulnerable time? No.

15:38.939 --> 15:39.773
Why would that
bother me?

15:39.898 --> 15:42.901
He was worried,
he made a bad choice.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.655
It's not a big deal.

15:47.822 --> 15:51.076
I know it seems like crap, you probably
feel like crap, but it's not.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.869
Legally, you haven't
adopted her yet.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.747
There's no obligations, no strings.
It could be undone tomorrow.

15:55.872 --> 15:59.376
Emotionally,
you'll feel guilty for a while,

15:59.501 --> 16:02.671
but the kid, she won't even
know you existed.

16:03.546 --> 16:04.923
You saying I should
give her back?

16:05.048 --> 16:08.551
Much better than having a mother
who doesn't give a crap.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.763
Thanks.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.724
I'm just gonna go drop it off
at the pound.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.352
(DOOR OPENING)

16:18.311 --> 16:19.813
(DOOR CLOSING)

16:19.938 --> 16:21.439
What did you want?

16:24.776 --> 16:27.487
We got a green light.
Go draw the patient's blood.

16:27.612 --> 16:28.863
Why?

16:28.989 --> 16:30.532
To see if it clumps
in the cold.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.826
She's making you
confirm your theory before you treat?

16:32.951 --> 16:34.619
She approved the bath.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.080
She just thought
we ought to do a test to confirm.

16:37.205 --> 16:38.873
That's more of
a yellow light, isn't it?

16:38.999 --> 16:41.543
So, she lets you
nuke the patient, no problem,

16:41.668 --> 16:45.088
but makes you
jump through hoops to give her a bath?

16:45.213 --> 16:46.798
Why would she do that?

16:46.923 --> 16:48.425
I think she was
playing you.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.428
Go draw the blood.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.893
I didn't realize the nurses
allowed any visitors in here.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.478
They don't.

17:00.603 --> 17:03.565
We'll just do these
problems, and then you have to go. Okay?

17:03.773 --> 17:06.109
- Okay.
- I need to draw some blood.

17:07.068 --> 17:10.655
I had a crush on my
teacher in fourth grade. And fifth.

17:10.780 --> 17:14.451
It's more that... Johnny was
a non-verbal autistic.

17:14.993 --> 17:20.540
Then for Sarah, he talks, makes eye
contact. He's like a regular kid.

17:21.332 --> 17:24.586
Since she got sick, he started going
back away from us.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.588
I had to bring him
in for a visit.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.631
Tell you what,

17:28.757 --> 17:30.925
I'll close the blinds
so the nurses don't ask questions.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.178
You can stay as long
as you want.

17:33.303 --> 17:34.763
We should have the results
in about an hour.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.181
I'll be here.

17:40.518 --> 17:41.728
SARAH: Good job.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.731
One minute at 39 degrees.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.525
Oh! Damn. Sorry.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.612
You all right?

17:50.737 --> 17:53.448
Don't be paranoid.
I feel great.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.784
Didn't expect the meds
to work this quickly.

17:55.909 --> 17:59.412
Let's not get ahead of ourselves,
you might not even be on the real drug.

17:59.537 --> 18:02.665
Several patients have shown improvement.
I know my test results have been better.

18:02.791 --> 18:04.417
I know I have
more energy.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.961
You ever hear the term
"placebo effect"?

18:08.046 --> 18:11.174
I guess I do have a few reasons
to feel good.

18:11.966 --> 18:15.970
But let's not get
ahead of ourselves, you're good,

18:16.096 --> 18:18.306
but not "curing
Huntington's" good.

18:21.684 --> 18:22.644
Good.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.270
(BEEPING)

18:30.902 --> 18:34.072
It's clumped.
House was right, ice bath's on.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.575
You got a sec?

18:39.327 --> 18:40.578
Don't be an idiot.

18:47.669 --> 18:48.878
(GASPING)

18:49.003 --> 18:52.549
KUTNER: I know it's hard, but you need
to stay in there for three minutes.

18:52.674 --> 18:53.591
(SHIVERING) It's okay.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.721
You come to
procedures now?

18:58.847 --> 19:01.641
Only the ones that might involve
stopping the patient's heart.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.601
Cameron tell you
to be here?

19:03.726 --> 19:04.769
Shut up.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.355
KUTNER: Tell me about Jonathan. How'd
you get him to come out of hiding?

19:07.480 --> 19:09.983
He was extremely
sensitive to touch,

19:10.108 --> 19:14.737
yet he had a tactile fascination
with newspaper.

19:14.863 --> 19:20.702
I mean, he wouldn't read it, he would
just touch it, crinkle it.

19:20.827 --> 19:25.081
I thought maybe that was a way in.
Papier-mâché and...

19:25.748 --> 19:26.958
(GROANS)

19:27.083 --> 19:30.461
And it was. He let
me into his world.

19:30.587 --> 19:33.131
Please tell her that talking
will ruin the test.

19:33.256 --> 19:39.804
All the kids, I try to become a part of
them, and have them become a part of me.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.598
How much longer until
the heart attack?

19:41.723 --> 19:44.350
KUTNER: I wanted to be a doctor from
the time I was eight years old,

19:44.475 --> 19:45.810
never wanted to be
a pediatrician though.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.395
Now they're both talking.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.647
SARAH: Well, I wanted
to be a sociologist.

19:50.023 --> 19:55.737
I was supposed to observe a class.
I was sent to room 214,

19:55.862 --> 19:58.281
but I went to
room 241 instead.

19:59.616 --> 20:02.118
It was a special ed
class. And I just...

20:02.827 --> 20:05.788
(EXHALES)
I just felt at home.

20:05.914 --> 20:07.081
(TIMER BEEPS)
Time. Heart rate's normal.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.499
You can get out now.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.712
It's not cold agglutinins.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.798
I'm not surprised.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.843
She obviously
has brain damage.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.971
Seriously.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.851
She screwed up a room number
six years ago,

20:26.976 --> 20:28.937
and you decide she
has brain damage?

20:29.062 --> 20:30.772
HOUSE: Transposed digits.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.192
Classic marker
for number confusion.

20:34.317 --> 20:37.111
It means she has a lesion in her left
parahippocampal region.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.781
I misdialed a phone number this morning.
It must be contagious.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.742
She also forgot to pee
before your fake test.

20:42.867 --> 20:43.701
So she has
a small bladder.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.703
Shows an inability
to predict the future.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.081
Also located in
the left hemisphere of the brain.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.083
Close to the
parahippocampal region.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.459
Means the damage
is ongoing.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.211
Two subtle clues,
six years apart,

20:53.336 --> 20:54.337
that's hardly
compelling evidence.

20:54.462 --> 20:55.463
I'm compelled.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.508
That's not what this is.
Every time a decent person comes in,

20:58.633 --> 21:00.301
you set out to prove that
they have brain damage.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.096
I never said her
deranged personality was a symptom.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.139
You don't need to.
I've been here five years.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.350
I can hear your thoughts
from my apartment.

21:08.685 --> 21:10.186
Can you hear me now?

21:11.604 --> 21:13.606
Move on to
another organ.

21:13.731 --> 21:14.816
I did.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.486
The screwed-up numbers and forgetting to
pee points to her being a human being.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.948
The platelet dysfunction and cardiac
arrest points to a pancreatic tumor.

21:22.073 --> 21:24.492
Or Multiple Sclerosis.

21:26.452 --> 21:27.662
The brain is like
the Internet,

21:27.787 --> 21:31.749
packets of information constantly
flowing from one area to another.

21:31.874 --> 21:35.878
Plaques in her brain are like
a bad server, slow down the flow.

21:36.004 --> 21:39.215
If it's in the parahippocampus,
it'll spread to the brain stem,

21:39.340 --> 21:41.301
which means it'll be
the lungs next.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.429
Brain biopsy will
show you the plaques.

21:44.846 --> 21:47.307
Or we could not
cut into her brain.

21:47.432 --> 21:49.726
It's just her pancreas.
We should do an ERCP.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.979
Or we could settle this
with rock, paper, scissors,

21:53.104 --> 21:57.442
but, unfortunately, there are people
who adjudicate these disputes.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.278
A pancreatic tumor
is much more likely to kill her.

22:00.403 --> 22:02.989
Not this week, not next week,
not next month.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.615
The number confusion
was six years ago.

22:04.741 --> 22:06.034
You don't think
we have time for an ERCP?

22:06.159 --> 22:07.702
The heart attack
was six hours ago.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.996
Now, maybe, it's planning to go into
hiding for a couple of years

22:10.121 --> 22:11.414
or maybe it's gonna
hit her lungs.

22:11.539 --> 22:12.707
Stop!

22:13.708 --> 22:16.377
We have to assume
it's the brain.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.504
I'll go fire up
the biopsy drill.

22:19.005 --> 22:22.717
No. We have to assume it's the brain
until we prove otherwise.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.719
Do an MRI,
T-2 images.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.514
You want me to
do another test?

22:28.639 --> 22:30.475
You should be able
to see the MS plaques.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.602
If they exist,
you can do your biopsy.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.314
No.

22:39.067 --> 22:42.737
You want to say yes,
you know you should say yes.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.573
But you also think that
this job is about standing up to me.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.533
So you're not gonna say yes,
you're not gonna say no.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.619
You're just gonna waste time.

22:49.744 --> 22:52.455
And the patient's brain or pancreas,
or whatever is wrong with her,

22:52.580 --> 22:54.457
is not gonna wait for you
to impress your boss.

22:54.582 --> 22:56.584
So, pick one,
either him or me.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.087
Do the MRI.

23:10.515 --> 23:11.599
(DOOR SLAMS)

23:11.891 --> 23:12.934
(DOOR OPENING)

23:13.893 --> 23:15.561
You still here?

23:16.437 --> 23:18.731
The whole point of giving Cameron
the job was so you could...

23:18.856 --> 23:20.483
I don't want
to go home.

23:21.901 --> 23:22.902
(GURGLING)

23:29.200 --> 23:31.160
House told me
I should give her back.

23:32.787 --> 23:36.791
Instead of being offended,
I've been wondering if he's right.

23:37.458 --> 23:40.002
He's not. He never is,

23:40.128 --> 23:43.673
not when it's anything
personal or human or...

23:43.798 --> 23:49.429
No. He's always cold, he's always an
ass, but he's very rarely just wrong.

23:50.221 --> 23:54.725
I've read every bonding
and attachment book there is.

23:55.685 --> 23:59.439
I feel like I'm in prison at home.
I feel like I'm free here.

23:59.564 --> 24:02.692
Parents make sacrifices.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.111
I don't know
if I want to.

24:08.072 --> 24:11.159
I'm not proud of this.
I feel terrible.

24:11.701 --> 24:13.619
I feel like a failure.

24:17.999 --> 24:19.250
(SIGHS)

24:20.626 --> 24:23.045
But she deserves
to be loved.

24:24.547 --> 24:28.593
(STAMMERING)
I don't know what to say.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.932
FOREMAN: No plaques
on the left hemisphere.

24:35.057 --> 24:36.100
Or the right.

24:36.225 --> 24:39.854
Even magnified images of
her hippocampal region. Nothing.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.107
This is surprising.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.277
So, can we
cancel the biopsy?

24:47.653 --> 24:49.697
Go ahead with ERCP.

24:54.785 --> 24:57.163
I need to talk
to you about Remy.

24:57.705 --> 24:58.706
Who?

24:58.831 --> 24:59.874
Thirteen.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.250
What did you call her?

25:01.375 --> 25:02.835
She's on placebo.

25:04.587 --> 25:06.881
And you want to
change that?

25:07.006 --> 25:11.969
I'm the last person you'd ever come
to for ethical advice, literally,

25:12.094 --> 25:15.264
which means you've already asked
every other person,

25:15.389 --> 25:17.099
and no one's giving you
the answer you want.

25:17.391 --> 25:20.853
Or I respect your opinion, and I want
to hear what comes to your mind.

25:20.978 --> 25:24.398
She invited any of her lesbian friends
into bed with you?

25:24.524 --> 25:26.067
I was mistaken.

25:26.442 --> 25:27.568
Drug gonna cure her?

25:30.071 --> 25:32.490
It looks promising,
reducing symptoms.

25:32.615 --> 25:33.449
No cure then.

25:33.574 --> 25:37.828
So, the pros are you might delay
the onset of symptoms,

25:37.954 --> 25:42.333
give her an extra year, maybe three.
She's still dead before you're 45.

25:42.458 --> 25:43.543
The question is,

25:43.668 --> 25:46.754
are those few years worth risking
the rest of your life in medicine?

25:50.841 --> 25:52.468
No.

25:52.593 --> 25:54.387
There. That wasn't
so hard, was it?

25:56.138 --> 25:57.306
Thank you.

25:57.431 --> 25:58.516
You're welcome.

26:00.643 --> 26:02.478
Unless you love her.

26:07.817 --> 26:11.821
If you love her,
then you do stupid things.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.622
KUTNER:
Common bile duct is clear.

26:21.747 --> 26:24.375
No filling defects
in the biliary tree.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.210
- Oh, God.
- What?

26:26.335 --> 26:29.547
It's her lungs. House was right.
O2 sats down to 89.

26:29.672 --> 26:30.965
(MACHINE BEEPING)
Increasing to 100% 02.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.174

Do we have to tell him?

26:40.516 --> 26:42.226
(COUGHING)

26:47.106 --> 26:49.400
FOREMAN: The surgeons were able
to drain the pleural effusions.

26:49.525 --> 26:52.486
The patient's breathing
on her own, but she's still pretty weak.

26:52.612 --> 26:55.531
Lung failure proves
that one of us was right.

26:55.656 --> 26:56.699
Who said "brain"?

26:56.824 --> 27:01.704
Yes, you predicted that her lungs would
fail, but the MRI was negative for MS.

27:01.829 --> 27:04.332
I was right about the where,
but not the what.

27:04.874 --> 27:08.586
A picornavirus could cause
localized demyelination

27:08.711 --> 27:10.379
that the MRI
wouldn't pick up.

27:10.963 --> 27:14.467
If we run a nerve conduction study
on the surface of her brain,

27:14.592 --> 27:16.260
we'll see the dead spots.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.429
You're talking about
cutting into her skull?

27:18.554 --> 27:22.475
Actually, I'm talking about cutting off
her skull, exposing her brain.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.310
KUTNER: A pancreatic
tumor could still fit.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.312
It explains the heart,
the blood and her lungs.

27:26.437 --> 27:28.439
ERCP was negative.

27:28.564 --> 27:32.443
And she agrees with me because she
agrees with me. Right, sweetie?

27:32.568 --> 27:35.988
All we need is a more sensitive test.
Endoscopic ultrasound.

27:36.113 --> 27:39.033
Just accept that
you've been proven wrong.

27:39.700 --> 27:42.703
You were also proven wrong.
Why don't I get a second test?

27:42.828 --> 27:44.497
Because if I'm right
about the brain,

27:44.622 --> 27:47.708
then we don't have time
to indulge your wrongness.

27:47.833 --> 27:51.504
Let me know when Cameron says yes
to cutting off our patient's skull.

27:51.629 --> 27:54.215
I'll be doing
the endoscopic ultrasound.

27:56.926 --> 28:02.139
Good news, I don't need your approval
for some crazy, unproven treatment.

28:02.264 --> 28:03.474
I just need to do a test.

28:03.599 --> 28:06.268
You want to remove
your patient's skull.

28:06.394 --> 28:08.562
Remind me to revoke
Kutner's telephone privileges.

28:08.771 --> 28:11.816
I didn't realize that
was an AMA-approved treatment for MS.

28:11.941 --> 28:16.237
Not searching for MS, but what
set it off. Equine encephalitis.

28:16.362 --> 28:19.198
Turned a cool breeze of
MS into a Cat 5 storm.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.617
I didn't realize your
patient was a horse.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.452
There's been human cases.

28:23.577 --> 28:26.372
Not when it's 30 degrees outside.
Transmission is by mosquito.

28:26.497 --> 28:28.958
So, she got bitten
six months ago.

28:29.083 --> 28:29.959
Or it's some
other infection.

28:30.084 --> 28:31.335
Whatever it is,
it's running rampant

28:31.460 --> 28:33.003
in the left side of her
brain.

28:33.129 --> 28:34.588
When I get in there
I'll get you the specifics.

28:34.714 --> 28:38.551
You're asking me to let you
cut off the top of someone's head.

28:38.676 --> 28:40.428
I need more than
"I'll know it when I see it."

28:40.553 --> 28:43.389
So, you want proof before you let me go
looking for the proof?

28:43.514 --> 28:44.348
This is the test.

28:44.473 --> 28:45.975
You have to give
me something.

28:50.229 --> 28:54.859
Cuddy's gonna love you. The patient,
on the other hand, is gonna hate you

28:54.984 --> 28:57.153
until the day
she dies next week.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.781
Actually, this idiot
will probably forgive you.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.299
I think these kids
are already spoken for.

29:18.424 --> 29:22.511
Not now. But since we're dating I just
thought you should know.

29:24.013 --> 29:25.639
I thought, because
of your illness...

29:25.765 --> 29:27.016
So did I.

29:27.850 --> 29:29.393
Even when I didn't
know if I had it or not,

29:29.602 --> 29:32.938
I just assumed
I couldn't take the chance. But now,

29:35.024 --> 29:40.112
even though I know
I have it, it feels like an option.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.417
You really don't have to
keep buying me things.

29:53.542 --> 29:54.877
Just open it.

29:59.757 --> 30:01.091
This is nice.

30:02.968 --> 30:06.639
The picture is
actually your gift.

30:09.558 --> 30:11.268
That's your baby.

30:11.393 --> 30:12.520
I took her picture
to one of those places

30:12.645 --> 30:14.480
that does that age enhancement thing.

30:14.605 --> 30:16.607
And according to the
kid who works there,

30:16.732 --> 30:17.942
this is a pretty
good approximation

30:18.067 --> 30:20.778
of what your daughter will look like
18 years from now.

30:21.529 --> 30:23.906
That's sort of cool.

30:24.573 --> 30:26.784
Right now, she's just this
weird little creature

30:26.909 --> 30:29.662
that sleeps and
poops and cries.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.457
But that is who
she's going to be.

30:34.375 --> 30:37.253
You will be teaching her
how to ride a bike,

30:37.461 --> 30:41.841
giving her advice about friends and
school and having her heart broken,

30:41.966 --> 30:45.135
she'll ignore most of it,
but some of it will stick.

30:45.553 --> 30:48.931
You're gonna
be there for her through all of that.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.101
You just have to get
through this part. That's all.

30:56.981 --> 30:58.232
It's very sweet.

31:03.153 --> 31:04.780
I'll pay you back
for the photo.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.285
Don't worry about it. That's just
the picture that came with the frame.

You can chuck it.

has the common cold?

it used to be.

31:44.945 --> 31:48.407
On the other hand, Kutner ran his
endoscopic ultrasound, didn't find peep.

31:48.532 --> 31:50.451
So, disproving it's her pancreas
proves it's her brain?

31:50.576 --> 31:51.785
Yes!

31:51.911 --> 31:52.870
(SIGHS)

31:52.995 --> 31:56.373
You used to do this job. Remember?
It's what used to pass for evidence.

31:56.498 --> 31:59.376
Now I do this job. You brought me three
dead bugs and a runny nose!

31:59.501 --> 32:02.129
I can't find you the proof you want
because it's trapped inside her head.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.715
The only way I can get
at it is to cut it open and rip it out,

32:04.840 --> 32:06.550
which is, apparently,
the one test you won't let me run.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.677
So, either I do this
or I do nothing.

32:08.802 --> 32:12.222
What do you want me to do? Say yes
just because you're House?

32:14.516 --> 32:16.810
I'd certainly
like that, yeah.

32:23.233 --> 32:24.568
Yes.

32:36.372 --> 32:38.540
Cameron actually
said yes?

32:38.874 --> 32:41.460
No, I'm just obsessive
about clean cuticles.

32:41.585 --> 32:43.170
Sawing off the
top of her skull

32:43.295 --> 32:45.422
and placing electrodes
on her brain is insane.

32:45.547 --> 32:48.759
Right, we should be re-testing her
pancreas for the umpteenth time.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.469
You're skipping steps
because it's Cameron.

32:50.594 --> 32:52.638
You haven't figured her out yet,
you want to see how far you can push.

32:52.763 --> 32:54.765
I'm skipping steps
because our patient is skipping steps

32:54.890 --> 32:56.475
on the way to being dead.

32:56.976 --> 32:57.977
If you got
a better idea...

32:58.102 --> 32:59.186
We should remove
her spleen.

32:59.311 --> 33:03.190

35:16.949 --> 35:20.327
Baby's crying is annoying you?
What's her nerve conduction?

35:20.452 --> 35:23.372
14.3. It's actually
speeding up.

35:23.497 --> 35:25.541
But her BP's 80 over palp.
We're gonna have to stop.

35:25.666 --> 35:26.667
(GROANS)

35:26.792 --> 35:28.502
That doesn't make
any sense.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.129
The fact that you're
wrong doesn't make any sense

35:30.254 --> 35:31.547
or the fact that
I believed that you were right?

35:31.672 --> 35:33.382
BP's still dropping.
She's gonna stroke.

35:34.800 --> 35:38.345
I'm giving her 10 more cc,
and I'm putting an end to this.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.848
(BABY CONTINUES CRYING)

35:40.973 --> 35:45.394
Okay, Rachel, quiet down.
I need you to be quiet.

35:45.519 --> 35:48.147
Please,
turn that phone off.

35:48.564 --> 35:51.775
Why does the baby
annoy you, but no one else does?

35:51.900 --> 35:53.402
I mean, you're right
about her, but...

35:53.944 --> 35:57.281
I don't know what you want.
I will give you anything that you want.

35:57.406 --> 35:59.324
I don't know
what it is.

36:01.451 --> 36:05.080
Tell me. Please.
Just help me. Please!

36:05.497 --> 36:06.874
(STOPS CRYING)

36:09.334 --> 36:10.502
(SNIFFLES)

36:11.879 --> 36:13.380
(CHUCKLES) Really?

36:15.090 --> 36:16.466
That worked?

36:20.179 --> 36:21.555
CAMERON: She's stable.

36:22.306 --> 36:24.725
We're finished here.
Close her up.

36:27.144 --> 36:28.604
(GURGLING)

36:29.146 --> 36:30.522
(CHUCKLES)

36:31.773 --> 36:33.233
(sesame)

36:39.364 --> 36:41.450
KUTNER: How long
until we can perform the splenectomy?

36:41.575 --> 36:44.578
Can't dose her with anesthesia until
the last batch completely clears.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.622
How come the baby
annoyed her?

36:46.747 --> 36:47.998
We should get her
in there as soon as we can.

36:48.290 --> 36:49.249
Two hours, at least.

36:49.374 --> 36:52.461
Her blood pressure's in the tank.
I hope she lasts two hours.

36:54.338 --> 36:55.839
What was different?

36:56.965 --> 36:59.843
Our patient loves
all things annoying.

37:00.260 --> 37:02.512
She'd love
this conversation.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.765
She's an earth mother,

37:04.890 --> 37:08.769
takes in the freaks and rejects of
humanity and tells them they're A-okay.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.395
So, what was different?

37:10.520 --> 37:15.776
Her head was open, you were asking her
questions, a baby was crying.

37:16.318 --> 37:18.528
She had low
blood pressure.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.657
According to the
laws of physics,

37:21.782 --> 37:24.326
low blood pressure
causes light-headedness

37:24.451 --> 37:27.955
chest pain,
but not annoyance.

37:44.805 --> 37:45.973
Move your feet.

37:46.890 --> 37:51.019
You decided to keep her. Thank you
for telling me. You can go now.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.482
(EXHALES)

37:55.607 --> 37:58.819
I talked to her.
We connected.

37:59.987 --> 38:04.074
You talked at her,
you had a chemical reaction.

38:04.199 --> 38:05.325
Are you trying
to annoy me?

38:05.450 --> 38:07.202
I'm trying to
explain you.

38:07.327 --> 38:11.581
I know it doesn't
make any sense, but it was real.

38:11.707 --> 38:13.125
It was there.

38:14.084 --> 38:17.004
You want to hold her?
Come here, come say hi.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.841
You think we'll bond?

38:30.142 --> 38:31.768
(LAUGHS)

38:31.893 --> 38:32.894
Is that cute?

38:33.020 --> 38:34.021
A little.

38:35.522 --> 38:37.858
If I threw up on you,
you'd be pissed.

38:38.692 --> 38:41.069
(COOING)
Your puke isn't as cute.

38:41.194 --> 38:43.238
That's 'cause of your hips.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.407
If she would've just
gestated a little longer,

38:45.532 --> 38:48.243
her stomach sphincter
would be fully mature.

38:48.368 --> 38:50.287
But, no, we have
to walk upright,

38:50.412 --> 38:52.998
which means that baby's
head is too big for mommy's hips.

38:53.123 --> 38:54.041
And by the way,

38:54.166 --> 38:57.002
your hips
may be an evolutionary improvement.

38:57.127 --> 39:00.464
So we've evolved to
find baby puke cute.

39:00.589 --> 39:04.343
'Cause otherwise we'd kill them all
before they became functional.

39:11.600 --> 39:15.062
Bonding's over.
I gotta go see another baby.

39:19.566 --> 39:22.569
So, I can just
live spleen-free?

39:22.694 --> 39:24.696
Plenty of people live perfectly
normal lives without...

39:24.821 --> 39:26.573
HOUSE: Spleen's fine.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.949
It's not her brain.

39:28.075 --> 39:29.326
Of course
it's her brain.

39:29.451 --> 39:33.121
You've looked at her brain, you took off
her skull, you found nothing.

39:33.246 --> 39:38.126
Didn't look in the right part. Didn't
look in the heart part.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.212
(HEART BEATING ON MONITOR)

39:40.337 --> 39:45.634
In the womb, blood has to bypass
the lungs since they don't work yet.

39:46.176 --> 39:50.389
When we're born, we take our first
big breath, lungs expand,

39:50.514 --> 39:53.850
and the ductus closes.
Yours didn't.

39:55.811 --> 39:58.397
She has a Patent
ductus arteriosus.

39:59.231 --> 40:03.235
When you get stressed,
your blood pressure goes up,

40:03.360 --> 40:07.239
forces open the ductus,
blood takes a little detour,

40:07.364 --> 40:11.159
makes it leak from your nose,
your stomach, your lungs,

40:11.284 --> 40:14.746
and more significantly, keeps it flowing
to the right side of your brain

40:14.871 --> 40:16.206
and away from your left.

40:17.290 --> 40:21.253
Which means that when you get stressed,
you get un-stressed.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.965
That's why you're so good
with those annoying kids.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.843
And why, when your blood
pressure dropped,

40:27.968 --> 40:31.763
you were able to identify Cuddy
as an annoying human being.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.725
Good news is
we can fix the heart.

40:37.310 --> 40:39.896
Bad news for
the annoying kids.

40:46.653 --> 40:48.113
CAMERON: She's incredible.

40:48.238 --> 40:49.156
Thank you.

40:51.408 --> 40:52.909
Great work today.

40:54.035 --> 40:56.955
I should have trusted your instincts.
I will in the future.

40:59.082 --> 41:00.208
I quit.

41:02.294 --> 41:06.214
I think I just apologized.
If you want, I can get down on my knees.

41:06.339 --> 41:08.049
It's not because
of you.

41:08.175 --> 41:13.221
I approved an insane procedure
with no proof, no evidence...

41:13.346 --> 41:14.890
You made the right call.

41:15.974 --> 41:19.144
The problem was a brain problem.
Without the procedure,

41:19.269 --> 41:22.189
House never notices
the increased left brain function.

41:22.314 --> 41:23.607
She'd be dead if
you hadn't said yes.

41:23.732 --> 41:26.234
I know. But...

41:28.945 --> 41:33.992
I'll always say yes to House.
I studied under him. He's in my head.

41:34.117 --> 41:36.870
And if you gave anyone else this job,
they would always say no.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.831
Because... Well,
because they should.

41:40.457 --> 41:42.083
House is insane.

41:44.211 --> 41:45.587
Which leaves me.

41:48.924 --> 41:50.217
I'm sorry.

41:51.301 --> 41:52.677

41:58.350 --> 41:59.893
Hey, buddy.

42:02.103 --> 42:04.356
It's okay, buddy,
come here.

42:04.481 --> 42:08.151
I missed you so much.
I missed you.

42:10.570 --> 42:11.696
How are you?

42:11.821 --> 42:14.157
- Good.
- Yeah? You look so handsome.
