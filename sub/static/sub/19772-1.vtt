00:23.509 --> 00:24.509
Both: Andi?

00:24.534 --> 00:27.076
Sorry, I haven't figured out
the brakes yet.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.732
So what do you think, you like it?

00:29.757 --> 00:31.875
Not like. Love!

00:31.900 --> 00:34.885
Literally, the best thing ever!

00:34.910 --> 00:35.880
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.280

I can't believe your mom
let you get this.

01:38.516 --> 01:41.307
Oh, she has no idea.
I traded in my bike.

01:41.490 --> 01:43.977
That, plus the money I made
cat-sitting for the Wadmans.

01:44.514 --> 01:45.514
Hold on, back up.

01:45.597 --> 01:48.006
You really think she'll let you
keep this thing?

01:48.078 --> 01:49.445
The woman wouldn't let you

01:49.470 --> 01:51.298
within 10 feet of a bouncy castle.

01:51.323 --> 01:53.410
All of that changes as of tomorrow.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.203
What happens tomorrow?

01:55.228 --> 01:56.416
I turn 13.

01:56.441 --> 01:57.441
I become a teenager.

01:57.579 --> 01:59.335
It means I get to rebel.

01:59.742 --> 02:01.359
Okay. Yeah, sure. Do that.

02:01.497 --> 02:02.497
But start with something simple.

02:02.617 --> 02:04.516
You know, some black nail polish.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.165
Or part your hair...

02:07.166 --> 02:08.663
(whispering) on the other side.

02:08.663 --> 02:11.159
Cyrus! The girl wants to up her game!

02:11.184 --> 02:12.306
Don't discourage her.

02:12.331 --> 02:13.954
I'm not trying to up my game.

02:13.979 --> 02:17.472
I'm just tired of hearing "no"
every time I ask for something,

02:17.497 --> 02:19.497
so this time, I just didn't ask.

02:21.166 --> 02:23.665
Girl: Well, here we are.
Still feelin' brave?

02:25.664 --> 02:26.664
Um...

02:26.665 --> 02:29.998
I'm impressed. We made it
almost to your driveway...

02:29.999 --> 02:31.663
before you chickened out.

02:31.664 --> 02:33.663
I'm not chickening out.

02:33.664 --> 02:35.373
I could hide it in my garage.

02:35.374 --> 02:36.663
Cyrus, would you?

02:36.664 --> 02:37.664
That'd be great.

02:37.665 --> 02:38.665
Bock-bock-bock.

02:40.664 --> 02:43.440
Whoa. Now that's the real deal.

02:44.374 --> 02:45.664
I like yours better.

02:49.832 --> 02:52.374
- Who is that?
- Do you know anyone who...

02:54.664 --> 02:55.776
Bex?

02:56.374 --> 02:57.374
Bex!

03:00.174 --> 03:01.396
Hey, Andiman.

03:01.664 --> 03:02.718
(both laughing)

03:03.374 --> 03:05.207
You guys, it's my sister!

03:05.374 --> 03:06.166
What are you doing here?

03:06.167 --> 03:08.663
What do you mean?
I couldn't miss your birthday,

03:08.664 --> 03:10.919
which, don't say it, I know
I've missed most of them.

03:11.338 --> 03:13.663
I don't care! You're here now.

03:13.664 --> 03:15.663
Uh, hi. I don't know if you remember me?

03:15.664 --> 03:18.373
Cyrus. Yeah, of course.

03:18.374 --> 03:21.664
- Are those your wheels?
- Oh. Uh...

03:22.664 --> 03:24.663
Yeah! Totally.

03:24.664 --> 03:28.301
Yeah, full-throttle outlaw,
kissing asphalt on my hog...

03:29.664 --> 03:31.253
Those are all the biker words I know.

03:32.664 --> 03:36.540
And, Buffy. Wow, you're like,
turning into the real Buffy.

03:36.541 --> 03:38.663
I am a real Buffy.

03:38.664 --> 03:42.663
And I would prefer not being compared
to a fictional vampire slayer

03:42.664 --> 03:45.663
on a television show
from the last century.

03:45.664 --> 03:49.663
Although, I recently started
watching it, and it's pretty good.

03:49.664 --> 03:52.373
(giggling) So does Mom know you're here?

03:52.374 --> 03:53.663
I want it to be a surprise.

03:53.664 --> 03:56.663
Oh. You know she hates surprises.

03:56.664 --> 03:58.663
Yeah! So, will you come with me?

03:58.664 --> 04:00.540
- Yeah!
- And tell her.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.664
Okay. Come on.

04:05.664 --> 04:08.165
Dad! Look who came home for my birthday!

04:08.166 --> 04:09.663
- Bex!
- Hi, Dad!

04:09.664 --> 04:11.540
What a wonderful surprise.

04:11.541 --> 04:13.663
Oh... I'm so happy.

04:13.664 --> 04:16.373
- Me, too.
- Celia, look who's here!

04:16.374 --> 04:17.435
I see.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.166
Hi, Mom.

04:19.832 --> 04:22.874
Rebecca. You look well.

04:23.277 --> 04:24.277
Thanks.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.040
So do you.

04:26.664 --> 04:27.998
How long will you be staying?

04:27.999 --> 04:31.076
Okay, so much for the pleasantries, huh?

04:31.664 --> 04:34.664
Dad, can you brace Mom,
and give her something to grab?

04:37.664 --> 04:38.801
I will be staying a while,

04:39.581 --> 04:42.998
'cause I'm... moving back home.

04:42.999 --> 04:45.247
- Really? Really?
- Yeah, really.

04:45.664 --> 04:47.337
- If that's okay.
- Of course it's okay.

04:47.362 --> 04:48.540
It's your home, too.

04:48.541 --> 04:51.663
Except your room
is now an office/home gym,

04:51.664 --> 04:54.663
and we sold all your toe rings
at a garage sale.

04:54.664 --> 04:57.373
We have a pull-out couch, and you
can stay for as long as you want.

04:57.374 --> 05:00.663
So my plan is, is to get a job,
and find a place to live.

05:00.664 --> 05:02.663
I'm really ready
to get my life together.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.300
Hmm. Why now?

05:05.774 --> 05:06.993
Well, I don't want this one to grow up

05:07.018 --> 05:08.552
- before I do.
- (laughing)

05:08.577 --> 05:09.767
Too late for that.

05:10.999 --> 05:12.663
Wow!

05:12.664 --> 05:14.663
Great dramatic exit, Mom.

05:14.664 --> 05:16.665
- You still got it.
- (sighs)

05:27.142 --> 05:29.663
- Hey. You busy?
- Hi.

05:29.664 --> 05:30.999
No, just messing around.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.998
Oh. What's this?

05:35.999 --> 05:38.373
It's a straw and a shoelace.

05:38.374 --> 05:39.663
Seriously?

05:39.664 --> 05:42.663
You just turned a straw
and a shoelace into a bracelet.

05:42.664 --> 05:44.523
Yeah. Look at this.

05:45.883 --> 05:47.664
Anything can be a bracelet.

05:48.664 --> 05:49.831
Comic books.

05:49.832 --> 05:50.998
Whoa...

05:51.335 --> 05:53.261
- Soda tabs.
- (laughs)

05:53.947 --> 05:57.027
And I think this was my old retainer.

05:57.374 --> 05:59.663
Which, if Mom asks,
I'm still wearing at night.

05:59.664 --> 06:02.118
(laughs) What? What do you do?

06:02.143 --> 06:03.663
You just take stuff out of the trash?

06:03.664 --> 06:06.165
Hello, carbon footprint,
future generations.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.663
And bonus, it drives Mom crazy.

06:09.287 --> 06:10.663
Yeah, I'll bet.

06:10.664 --> 06:11.664
Can I have this?

06:11.665 --> 06:13.663
No, let me make you something special.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.924
No, this is special. I love it.

06:18.664 --> 06:21.242
- (makes shooting noise)
- (Andi laughs)

06:21.395 --> 06:22.664
Did you make this, too?

06:22.665 --> 06:24.613
Yeah, out of the scarves you sent me.

06:24.999 --> 06:26.253
Andi...

06:26.664 --> 06:30.165
Look. Mardi Gras, the Texas State Fair,

06:30.166 --> 06:32.999
that music festival where
people supposedly get naked.

06:34.664 --> 06:35.825
They do?

06:35.999 --> 06:37.831
(gasps) Did you?

06:37.832 --> 06:40.663
What? No, come on.
You know me better than that.

06:41.613 --> 06:42.998
I really don't.

06:44.048 --> 06:45.663
That's true. You don't.

06:46.253 --> 06:47.663
But I can fix that.

06:47.664 --> 06:48.664
Don't move. I'll be right back.

06:48.664 --> 06:49.664
Okay.

06:52.676 --> 06:54.165
(panting)

06:54.603 --> 06:56.458
No, no, no, no, no, no!

07:00.924 --> 07:03.453
Andi never sees what's inside this box.

07:03.699 --> 07:04.663
It's just pictures.

07:04.664 --> 07:06.663
They're not just pictures.

07:06.664 --> 07:08.165
It's secrets.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.664
Things she doesn't need to see or know.

07:12.664 --> 07:16.165
Okay, Mom. I won't show her the box.

07:16.794 --> 07:17.794
Thank you.

07:33.664 --> 07:34.664
Okay.

07:38.664 --> 07:43.663
This is like my diary. You can't tell
anyone anything you see in here.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.663
- Okay?
- Okay.

07:45.664 --> 07:46.664
- You ready?
- Uh-huh.

07:55.664 --> 07:57.663
What about... this guy?

07:57.664 --> 08:02.663
Oh! Fletcher. He's a pirate,
so I don't see him very often.

08:02.664 --> 08:05.663
- A pirate?
- I'm kidding. He's not a pirate.

08:05.664 --> 08:08.663
But he does have a boat,
has a pet bird, so...

08:08.664 --> 08:11.374
- So pretty close.
- (both laughing)

08:12.541 --> 08:14.125
Your life looks so amazing.

08:14.405 --> 08:15.663
Uh, so does yours.

08:16.152 --> 08:17.663
Which part? The stuff
I'm not allowed to do?

08:17.664 --> 08:21.179
The stuff I'm not allowed to eat? Or
the stuff I'm not allowed to wear?

08:21.664 --> 08:24.149
- Is it that bad?
- It'll be better with you here.

08:24.283 --> 08:25.663
- We'll hang out.
- It'll be fun!

08:25.664 --> 08:26.341
Yeah.

08:26.366 --> 08:28.373
Maybe not
Mardi-Gras-music-festival fun,

08:28.374 --> 08:30.061
but we can get pizza!

08:30.541 --> 08:32.065
Well, sometimes.

08:32.886 --> 08:33.998
When Dad's in charge.

08:33.999 --> 08:36.419
You know what? I'm already having fun.

08:36.664 --> 08:39.114
You made me a bracelet.
I like your friends.

08:39.407 --> 08:40.874
I like your room.

08:41.287 --> 08:43.663
Ooh, this guy looks like fun.

08:43.664 --> 08:45.663
- Jonah Beck.
- You didn't see that.

08:45.664 --> 08:47.165
- Oh, no?
- And I have homework.

08:47.166 --> 08:50.663
- Okay, cool. Andi, calm down.
- Yeah, I'm calm! Okay?

08:50.664 --> 08:53.197
Okay, okay. I'll go unpack.

08:53.296 --> 08:56.282
- Yeah, you should do that.
- Enjoy your picture of Jonah Beck.

08:56.397 --> 08:57.397
Stop!

09:05.114 --> 09:06.639
Forgot my box.

09:07.267 --> 09:08.267
Right.

09:08.459 --> 09:09.734
- Bye.
- (door closes)

09:14.664 --> 09:17.095
You didn't have to get me
a birthday present.

09:17.120 --> 09:19.295
Well, I'm not sure it's gonna
top what Mom got you,

09:19.320 --> 09:21.168
<i>The Unabridged History of Math.</i>

09:21.374 --> 09:23.663
Oh, no, wait. It is gonna top that.

09:24.232 --> 09:25.512
Here it comes.

09:27.664 --> 09:28.998

He's gonna teach you
how to play Frisbee.

09:39.607 --> 09:41.214
I got you a lesson, that's your present.

09:41.215 --> 09:43.214
- No. No.
- Yeah! Yeah.

09:43.215 --> 09:44.464
- No.
- Just relax.

09:44.832 --> 09:46.058
- No.
- Great.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.903
Just like that, except the exact
opposite. Cool, you're great.

09:49.092 --> 09:50.382

- Yep.

09:50.383 --> 09:53.214

You're joining the team!
Say yes! Right now!

10:58.730 --> 11:00.214
Say it, yes, I'm joining the team.

11:00.215 --> 11:02.344
- What team?
- The Ultimate Frisbee team!

11:02.370 --> 11:03.484
Der, I'm the captain!

11:03.717 --> 11:06.847
I know, der, but that's a sport.
I don't play sports.

11:06.929 --> 11:07.929
I'm an indoor person.

11:07.954 --> 11:09.133
What if you're really an outdoor person?

11:09.217 --> 11:10.640
I think I would've heard.

11:10.925 --> 11:12.672
Listen, you're good at this.

11:12.791 --> 11:15.080
- I am?
- Come on, check it out.

11:15.215 --> 11:17.200
We got practice tomorrow after school.

11:19.215 --> 11:21.214
You like this. I know you do.

11:21.747 --> 11:22.747
I do.

11:22.798 --> 11:23.918
I like you.

11:24.902 --> 11:25.902
It!

11:26.159 --> 11:27.658
I like it, the Frisbee!

11:27.855 --> 11:30.065
Yeah, just delete what I said before.

11:30.717 --> 11:34.215
- Amber Alert. Amber Alert.
- Stop...

11:36.055 --> 11:37.310
This is Amber.

11:37.690 --> 11:39.076
His girlfriend.

11:39.215 --> 11:42.084
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

11:42.550 --> 11:44.550
You guys are a cute couple, heh...

11:45.550 --> 11:48.482
You don't go to Jefferson,
'cause I would remember that.

11:48.717 --> 11:50.057
I go to Grant.

11:50.215 --> 11:54.231
Oh, high school. You're in high school.

11:54.256 --> 11:55.884
I love that you have groupies.

11:58.215 --> 11:59.215
I have to go.

12:01.417 --> 12:05.059
And by the way, Amber Alerts
are for kidnapped children,

12:05.084 --> 12:07.533
so kind of terrifying,
as opposed to cute.

12:08.215 --> 12:10.260
Just something to... think about.

12:14.215 --> 12:16.713
Andi... Andi! Wait up!

12:18.215 --> 12:20.017
Hey! What's goin' on?

12:20.215 --> 12:22.214
Why did you do this to me?

12:22.215 --> 12:24.214
- Do what? What did I do?
- This! This whole thing.

12:24.215 --> 12:26.630
I just made an epic fool of myself.

12:26.655 --> 12:28.214
Uh, not the part that I saw.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.382
You were amazing.

12:29.383 --> 12:31.610
- And Jonah Beck...
- Has a girlfriend!

12:32.215 --> 12:33.606
Who's in high school!

12:33.715 --> 12:34.715
Did you see her?

12:35.216 --> 12:36.441
Don't look now!

12:37.215 --> 12:40.214
What? She's like a pretty girl.
She's nothing. She's not you.

12:40.215 --> 12:42.214
That's right, she's here,

12:42.215 --> 12:44.220
whereas I am... move your foot...

12:45.215 --> 12:46.234
...there.

12:46.383 --> 12:49.088
Where you were just stepping on.

12:49.215 --> 12:51.815
Okay, stop. You obviously
can't see yourself.

12:51.840 --> 12:52.840
But you can?

12:53.768 --> 12:54.768
Okay.

12:56.769 --> 12:58.767
You were raised to think
you have to be perfect,

12:58.768 --> 12:59.729
but you don't.

12:59.754 --> 13:02.362
If you made a fool of yourself,
you know what? That's good.

13:02.387 --> 13:04.595
Good? It wasn't good.

13:04.722 --> 13:06.534
- Trust me.
- That's the point.

13:07.015 --> 13:09.631
You need moments like these.
They're the moments you remember.

13:09.656 --> 13:12.099
They're the moments you learn from.
They become your funny stories

13:12.124 --> 13:14.148
you tell about yourself
when you meet someone new.

13:14.173 --> 13:16.260
That's you! That's not me!

13:16.320 --> 13:18.319
Not yet. I'm tryin' to help you!

13:18.344 --> 13:20.108
I don't need your help!

13:20.267 --> 13:23.601
All I'm saying, is that I've been
there, and I know how you feel.

13:23.626 --> 13:25.005
No, you don't!

13:25.723 --> 13:27.066
I'm not like you.

13:27.214 --> 13:29.213
I'm not cool or adventurous.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.638
I'm not one of those people
in your memory box.

13:32.260 --> 13:33.761
Those are the people you know.

13:33.786 --> 13:35.781
I'm just a girl you send scarves to!

13:46.645 --> 13:47.703
(sighs)

13:47.883 --> 13:48.963
(phone chimes)

13:49.094 --> 13:50.094
(sighs)

14:10.054 --> 14:11.306
(door opens, closes)

14:27.768 --> 14:28.772
Bex?

14:30.240 --> 14:32.522
Oh, great. I woke you.

14:32.929 --> 14:34.821
This has been a banner day.

14:35.521 --> 14:37.280
Don't worry, I'm leaving
first thing in the morning.

14:37.305 --> 14:39.304
No, Bex, don't go, I don't want you to.

14:39.340 --> 14:41.735
I take back what I said,
every word of it.

14:41.973 --> 14:43.744
- You don't have to.
- But can I?

14:43.769 --> 14:47.118
Please, because you were right. These
are the moments I'll remember.

14:47.540 --> 14:49.099
Jonah Beck texted me.

14:49.254 --> 14:51.346
I don't even know how he has my number.

14:52.144 --> 14:53.976
Don't be mad, but I... gave it to him.

14:54.130 --> 14:55.743
- You did?
- But he asked for it, though.

14:55.768 --> 14:59.328
He did? Jonah Beck asked for my number?

14:59.869 --> 15:02.489
That's an amazing sentence.
I need to say it again.

15:02.514 --> 15:04.573
Jonah Beck asked for my number.

15:05.501 --> 15:06.821
I'm just glad you're happy.

15:06.846 --> 15:07.928
So you'll stay!

15:08.649 --> 15:09.649
I can't.

15:10.054 --> 15:11.962
Yeah, you can. Everything's okay.

15:12.026 --> 15:14.050
Give me a minute and it won't be.

15:14.642 --> 15:16.715
"These are the moments you'll remember?"

15:18.054 --> 15:19.588
I'm just quoting you.

15:19.655 --> 15:21.980
Well, I've made too many mistakes.

15:22.334 --> 15:23.334
When?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.086
Today.

15:25.111 --> 15:27.440
No, you didn't, that's
what I'm trying to tell you.

15:27.768 --> 15:29.821
And yesterday,
and the day before that...

15:31.768 --> 15:33.560
and every single day of your life.

15:34.387 --> 15:35.808
What are you talking about?

15:40.196 --> 15:41.528
You're scaring me.

15:42.568 --> 15:44.194
You should be scared.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.528
Do you think that you're not in here?

15:50.166 --> 15:51.166
You are.

16:01.084 --> 16:02.207
Is that you?

16:04.768 --> 16:06.801
And... that's you.

16:09.768 --> 16:13.266
Andi... I'm not your sister.

16:17.103 --> 16:18.422
I'm your mother.

16:23.674 --> 16:24.942
You're my what?

16:25.339 --> 16:27.850
Your mother. I'm your mother.

16:27.924 --> 16:28.894
Mom!

16:28.919 --> 16:29.919
Mom!

16:30.080 --> 16:31.788
No, please, she's gonna be so mad.

16:32.049 --> 16:33.970
(stammers) She says she's my mother!

16:34.339 --> 16:36.338
- Ham!
- So this is all true?

16:36.339 --> 16:39.048
- You had no right!
- It just slipped out!

16:39.049 --> 16:40.651
- What's goin' on?
- She knows!

16:40.717 --> 16:42.997
My brain feels like it's melting!

16:43.339 --> 16:45.223
- How does she know?
- I told her.

16:45.339 --> 16:46.829
You had no right.

16:47.049 --> 16:50.048
You don't get to be upset!
You don't get to be upset!

16:50.049 --> 16:52.391
Nobody here gets to be upset but me!

16:52.674 --> 16:56.338
Because you all have been lying to me

16:56.666 --> 16:59.339
for my whole life!

17:07.215 --> 17:08.338
I can't be here right now.

17:08.339 --> 17:10.338
- Andi...
- No, I should be the one.

17:10.339 --> 17:12.506
No, please, Mom. It's my job now.

17:13.049 --> 17:14.886
We knew this day had to come.

17:14.911 --> 17:17.839
No. I didn't! I didn't know
today was the day

17:17.840 --> 17:19.506
I was gonna lose my daughter!

17:19.507 --> 17:21.338
I'm standing right in front of you.

17:21.339 --> 17:22.749
Not you!

17:25.981 --> 17:29.730
Celia, this has happened,
we need to accept that.

17:30.339 --> 17:32.339
And figure out how to make it work.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.180
(crickets chirring)

17:45.339 --> 17:46.340
(knocking on door)

18:01.103 --> 18:03.339
Please... don't touch anything.

18:07.664 --> 18:08.871
Are these my CDs?

18:09.431 --> 18:11.639
Kinda. Sorry.

18:12.339 --> 18:14.924
Yeah, I'm real torn up I can't
listen to Nickelback anymore.

18:19.339 --> 18:21.696
Andi... I'm so, so sorry...

18:21.721 --> 18:25.546
Stop! I can't, it's too weird.

18:26.721 --> 18:30.123
When I look at you, I see my
cool sister out in the world,

18:30.148 --> 18:32.036
having adventures on her motorcycle.

18:32.354 --> 18:34.196
But that's not who you are.

18:35.746 --> 18:37.456
You're my mother...

18:38.584 --> 18:39.874
who abandoned me.

18:40.129 --> 18:41.583
That's not what happened.

18:42.721 --> 18:44.524
- Do you wanna know what happened?
- No.

18:46.223 --> 18:47.721
Not right now.

18:49.598 --> 18:52.055
Whenever you're ready,
I'll tell you everything,

18:52.056 --> 18:53.720
whatever you wanna know.

18:53.721 --> 18:56.431
Just... I wanna think about my
text from Jonah for a while.

18:57.567 --> 18:58.721
That's a great idea.

19:09.721 --> 19:10.922
You probably hate me.

19:11.816 --> 19:13.580
You probably should hate me.

19:15.431 --> 19:18.722
But I'll always love you,
and I always have.

19:20.721 --> 19:22.798
And you have that,
whether you want it or not.

19:46.721 --> 19:47.721
Hey, Cyrus.

19:47.722 --> 19:50.597
Hey, hey. Can you say,
"Nice bike, Cyrus"?

19:50.598 --> 19:51.766
Nope.

19:52.431 --> 19:54.574
Thanks, Buffy.
I think it's a nice bike, too.

19:54.721 --> 19:56.771
You know what we bikers say: Four wheels

19:56.796 --> 20:00.305
move the body, but two wheels
move the soul.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.537
You brought the bike. Thanks.

20:02.721 --> 20:04.720
(coughs) I'm running out of air.

20:04.721 --> 20:05.736
(breathing heavily)

20:07.223 --> 20:08.888
You ready to take off
the training wheels?

20:08.889 --> 20:11.550
Um, I'm not even sure I'm keeping it.

20:11.721 --> 20:13.721
Did something happen on your birthday?

20:13.722 --> 20:15.453
I tried calling you all day.

20:15.721 --> 20:17.262
Yeah, me, too. No answer.

20:17.721 --> 20:20.720
Yeah, something happened,
something really, really big.

20:20.721 --> 20:23.720
- Are you gonna tell us?
- I can't just blurt it out right here.

20:23.721 --> 20:25.623
- Why not?
- Buffy!

20:25.889 --> 20:27.720
Are you not listening?

20:27.721 --> 20:31.835
She's a different person. Something
really, really big happened.

20:32.721 --> 20:35.720
We know what you're trying to tell us.
You don't need to spell it out.

20:35.721 --> 20:36.985
Trust me, you don't.

20:37.721 --> 20:39.222
- (school bell ringing)
- I gotta go. It's my first period.

20:39.223 --> 20:41.696
- Exactly.
- What?

20:42.476 --> 20:43.636
He's crazy.

20:53.721 --> 20:54.721
Dude, you came!

20:54.722 --> 20:56.720
I'm still not sure about this.

20:56.721 --> 20:57.889
It's okay. I am.

21:01.598 --> 21:03.720
Andiman, how'd you come up with that?

21:03.721 --> 21:05.720
Isn't that what everyone calls you?

21:05.721 --> 21:08.898
Just... one person.

21:09.721 --> 21:11.055
Now it's two.

21:11.056 --> 21:12.720
Get out there, Andiman.

21:12.721 --> 21:14.617
This disc isn't gonna catch itself.

22:03.598 --> 22:04.938
Well, that's new.

22:05.270 --> 22:06.559
I got an electric scooter.

22:06.721 --> 22:08.055
You like it?

22:08.056 --> 22:09.720
No, I don't.

22:09.721 --> 22:12.430
It's super safe, it only goes
like 12 miles an hour.

22:12.431 --> 22:14.385
Really? Hmm. Still, no.

22:14.721 --> 22:19.055
Well, I wish you didn't feel
that way, but... I'm keeping it.

22:19.623 --> 22:23.468
Andi, I know you feel your
world's been turned upside down,

22:23.493 --> 22:25.020
but I'm still in your life.

22:25.347 --> 22:27.720
Everything works just like
it always has.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.430
Nothing has changed.

22:29.431 --> 22:33.347
Sure. Nothing's changed... Grandma.

22:35.657 --> 22:37.720
Grand... ma...?

22:37.721 --> 22:39.430
Nope. No...

22:40.543 --> 22:41.598
(knocking on door)

22:43.223 --> 22:45.720
Remember when you said you wanted
to make me something special?

22:45.721 --> 22:47.721
Is that offer still good?

22:47.722 --> 22:50.888
Sure, but I'm... kinda busy.

22:50.889 --> 22:53.720
No rush, whenever. I just, um...

22:53.721 --> 22:58.023
I wanted to be able
to wear... this again.

23:00.939 --> 23:02.052
You saved it.

23:02.365 --> 23:03.365
This one, too.

23:06.721 --> 23:07.722
Was this mine?

23:09.721 --> 23:12.340
Can I see that picture again, of us?

23:20.721 --> 23:23.399
Wait, you have pictures
of all your boyfriends in here?

23:23.721 --> 23:24.721
Pretty much.

23:24.722 --> 23:26.720
Which one's my dad?

23:26.721 --> 23:29.450
Hey! Who wants pizza, huh?

23:29.475 --> 23:31.543
You said you would tell me
everything when I'm ready.

23:31.568 --> 23:34.222
I know, I did, it's just
that you're not...

23:34.223 --> 23:35.629
I'm not ready.

23:36.721 --> 23:38.970
Just let me know when you are.

Andi: Next, on <i>Andi Mack...</i>

24:30.984 --> 24:33.624
Cyrus, that's private!

24:33.984 --> 24:37.691
Your sister has a secret baby?

24:37.984 --> 24:39.860
Yeah, she... she... she does.

24:39.861 --> 24:41.860
Your backhand's lookin' tight, Andiman.

24:41.861 --> 24:42.983
It is?

24:42.984 --> 24:44.983
Go for it, he doesn't seem
to have a girlfriend.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.983
He does, she's in ninth grade.

Cyrus: She's... pretty.

24:50.603 --> 24:51.605
You rock, Andiman.

24:51.630 --> 24:53.151
Am I losing you, Jonah?

24:53.152 --> 24:54.984
She thinks you're a threat.
