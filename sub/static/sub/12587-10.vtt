<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:31.990 --> 00:33.958
Yep.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.710
Mm-hmm.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.546
Did you guys watch last night's
episode of <i>Survivorguy</i> ?

00:38.539 --> 00:41.167
I can't believe he used
a snake like a lasso

00:41.166 --> 00:42.884
to swing across that ravine!

00:42.876 --> 00:44.549
That was amazing.
Dang ol' hardcore, man.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.513
Survivorguy's not tough.

00:46.505 --> 00:49.805
I've been using snakes as lassos
since the second grade.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.974
Dale, the man braves
the world's roughest terrain,

00:52.970 --> 00:55.439
armed only with willpower
and a knife.

00:55.430 --> 00:58.855
He's the greatest
American hero ever born.

00:58.850 --> 00:59.976
In Canada.

00:59.977 --> 01:02.400
Okay, you want to see willpower?

01:02.396 --> 01:03.898
For the next seven days,

01:03.897 --> 01:07.743
I will eschew modern luxuries
and live entirely off the land.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.987
I'll even postpone date night.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.204
Date night?

01:11.196 --> 01:12.823
Every Friday, Nancy and I share

01:12.823 --> 01:14.951
a romantic evening on the town.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.996
And we don't go home until
Nancy's out of money.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.212
Huh.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.172
I haven't taken Peggy
on a date since...

01:23.750 --> 01:24.967
Huh.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.928
Hank, man, you talkin' about
that thing about women, man,

01:27.087 --> 01:29.181
you got to keep that dang
ol' flame alive, man,

01:29.172 --> 01:30.594
pitch woo, too, man.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.763
Woo, huh?

01:31.758 --> 01:34.432
Well, I did see a coupon
to the Pasta Garden

01:34.428 --> 01:35.930
in the Sunday paper.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.978
A free iced tea with
the purchase of any appetizer.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.851
I'd love to take
advantage of that.

01:40.851 --> 01:44.071
I hope Peggy knows
how lucky she is.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.992
Hey, there...

01:48.984 --> 01:50.236
beautiful.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.908
Hank, what are you doing?

01:51.903 --> 01:54.998
I am approaching you
with romantic intent.

01:54.990 --> 01:58.290
Peggy, will you go
on a date with me this Friday?

01:58.285 --> 01:59.537
A date?

01:59.536 --> 02:01.755
Why? We're married.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.920
Wait, are you gonna
tell me something awful

02:03.915 --> 02:05.963
in a public place
so I won't make a scene?

02:05.959 --> 02:07.131
Na!

02:07.127 --> 02:09.300
Can't a husband
take his wife out on a date?

02:09.295 --> 02:10.673
I want to show you off.

02:10.672 --> 02:11.889
Is that crazy?

02:11.882 --> 02:14.510
It is the sanest thing
you've ever said.

02:14.509 --> 02:15.806
But what about Bobby?

02:15.802 --> 02:17.179
Friday is our game night.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.227
Bobby's 13 years old.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.316
I don't think he wants
to spend Friday night

02:21.308 --> 02:22.560
with his parents anymore.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.233
Come on, we could make this
a regular thing.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.981
Like cleaning the gutters
or re-grouting.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.530
Hank Hill,
if you treat me as tenderly

02:30.525 --> 02:31.993
as you treat those gutters,

02:31.985 --> 02:33.953
it's gonna be quite a night.

02:36.823 --> 02:40.544
Guess who found a bottle of
Old Spice underneath the sink?

02:40.535 --> 02:41.536
Mmm.

02:42.829 --> 02:43.830
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:43.830 --> 02:45.127
game on!

02:45.123 --> 02:48.218
Okay, last week, things
got a little hot,

02:48.210 --> 02:50.963
but I promise not to flip
over the board tonight.

02:50.962 --> 02:54.762
Honey, your father and I
are going out on a date.

02:54.758 --> 02:57.637
We were thinking of making
Fridays our regular date night.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.309
Date night?

02:59.304 --> 03:00.977
Oh, you got me!

03:00.972 --> 03:03.270
Okay, you can be the little car.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.609
Nice bluff, Mom.

03:08.105 --> 03:10.483
Wait, you're serious?

03:10.482 --> 03:11.699
Come on, Bobby.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.320
I know the box says
ages eight to 80,

03:14.319 --> 03:16.913
but it's supposed to drop
off a bit in the middle.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.248
Fine.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.914
I'll hit the mall with Joseph
and his football buddies.

03:20.909 --> 03:24.163
But don't blame me when
your dinner conversation stinks!

03:24.162 --> 03:27.291
Tell you what, we will
pick you up on our way home.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.792
Let's say 9:00?

03:28.792 --> 03:30.669
Fine, great, sure.
See you at 9:00.

03:30.669 --> 03:31.841
Have fun. Okay, then.

03:34.673 --> 03:38.849
I'm stranded out here in the
wild plains of Arlen, Texas...

03:38.844 --> 03:41.472
The Devil's Epiglottis.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.973
As the temperature plummets

03:42.973 --> 03:46.773
into the low 60s,
a sturdy shelter

03:46.768 --> 03:50.989
is all that stands between me
and certain death.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.404
It's funny.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.994
Out here, I'm so vulnerable
to the elements,

03:55.986 --> 03:58.956
yet more than anything,
I just miss my family.

04:01.158 --> 04:04.332
The loneliness,
that's what gets to you.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.969
Date night.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.258
What's that about?

04:14.254 --> 04:17.884
The Hills used to be
a Bobby-centric family.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.682
What if I'm not the center
of their universe anymore?

04:20.677 --> 04:22.896
My dad and I
never do stuff together.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.853
He says it's safer
if we spread out.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.978
I can't believe I'm stuck at
the mall when I should be home

04:28.977 --> 04:31.730
watching my dad
tip over the Jenga stack.

04:31.730 --> 04:32.902
The guy's all thumbs.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.407
It's hilarious.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.946
You sure love
your parents, dude.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.281
You're gay.

04:43.825 --> 04:44.917
Look at us, Peggy.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.002
We're on a date.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.247
Isn't it exciting?

04:48.246 --> 04:50.123
So, Hank Hill,

04:50.123 --> 04:53.297
do you promise
to have me home by curfew?

04:53.293 --> 04:54.670
Well, sure.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.216
Unless the service is slow,

04:56.213 --> 04:58.511
I don't anticipate
there being a problem.

05:00.967 --> 05:01.968
Oh, uh,

05:01.968 --> 05:03.470
w-we didn't order these.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.893
They're complimentary, sir.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.900
Complimentary salad
and bread sticks?

05:09.059 --> 05:11.903
Hank, did you call ahead
and set this up?

05:12.062 --> 05:13.905
I wish I could take credit.

05:14.064 --> 05:17.193
This place just seems
to specialize in class.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.738
I don't care
if she doesn't have a head,

05:21.738 --> 05:23.911
that chick is hot!

05:32.999 --> 05:34.967
You guys keep at it.

05:34.960 --> 05:35.961
I'm just gonna go

05:35.961 --> 05:38.931
wait outside for my parents.

05:44.553 --> 05:47.557
Uh, are you kicking me
on purpose?

05:47.556 --> 05:49.979
Hank, I am not kicking you.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.443
I am playing footsie.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.731
Oh, right.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.657
You're it.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.957
Finally!

06:16.710 --> 06:17.882
Boy, what a meal.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.467
I had no idea
what kind of things

06:20.463 --> 06:22.966
they were putting
inside ravioli these days.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.890
My friends, I hope you saved
room for coffee and dessert.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.729
Actually, coffee sounds great.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.564
Really? Well, in that case,

06:29.556 --> 06:31.979
uh, maybe I'll try
this thing right here.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.353
A wonderful
choice, Mr. Hill.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.275
Our Mount Vesuvius hot lava cake

06:36.271 --> 06:37.989
takes about 20
minutes to prepare.

06:37.981 --> 06:38.948
Will that be okay?

06:39.983 --> 06:41.280
Go for it, Hank.

06:41.276 --> 06:44.655
Lucky for you, I have
a 20-minute anecdote.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.452
When you're eight years old,

06:46.448 --> 06:50.248
New Orleans seems like the other
end of the world to you.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.962
So this is how it ends.

07:00.962 --> 07:04.933
Date night!

07:14.351 --> 07:18.151
I wonder if it's too late
for me to coach in the NFL.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.444
I don't need to be
head coach right away.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.364
I'm willing to start out
as an offensive coordinator.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.490
Peggy, would you join me
on my side of the booth?

07:28.490 --> 07:31.039
Hank Hill,
you are blowing my mind.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.584
Hello.

07:39.584 --> 07:40.710
Hello?

07:40.710 --> 07:41.962
That's all you got?

07:41.962 --> 07:43.964
Just what the heck is going on?!

07:43.964 --> 07:44.965
What do you mean?

07:44.965 --> 07:45.966
We're finishing dinner.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.968
We'll be there
to pick you up at 9:00.

07:47.968 --> 07:48.935
Oh, really?

07:49.094 --> 07:51.973
Well, you might want to
check your watch, buddy boy.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.770
It's 10:30!

07:53.765 --> 07:54.766
Oh, my God.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.393
Peggy, it's 10:30:

07:56.393 --> 07:57.485
10:30?!

07:57.477 --> 07:58.478
Where's Bobby?!

07:58.478 --> 07:59.525
Bobby, where are you?

07:59.521 --> 08:01.990
I'm at the Get In/Get Out.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.359
I hope you're happy.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.861
I'm watching prostitutes
buy panty hose.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.703
He's at the Get In/Get Out.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.929
Bobby, uh, sometimes
married people

08:23.920 --> 08:25.763
get caught up in a
meal, and they...

08:25.755 --> 08:26.677
Bah!

08:28.633 --> 08:29.634
Honey, the thing is...

08:29.634 --> 08:30.931
Don't want to hear it!

08:32.971 --> 08:34.722
Honey, we had...

08:34.722 --> 08:36.066
La-la-la, nope!

08:40.937 --> 08:41.904
I can't believe it.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.942
I-I don't leave my sunglasses
in the car overnight,

08:44.941 --> 08:47.319
but I leave my boy
in a parking lot?

08:47.318 --> 08:49.741
If he takes a hammer
to our heads while we sleep,

08:49.738 --> 08:51.240
I would not blame him.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.992
It was an honest mistake,
but we apologized.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.120
Everything will be okay
in the morning.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.166
Right.

08:57.162 --> 09:00.587
He'll be okay in the morning.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.459
Hope you enjoyed your dessert.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.802
What's that?

09:03.793 --> 09:04.794
Hmm? Nothing.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.552
Oh, Bobby!

09:12.552 --> 09:13.678
Good morning!

09:13.678 --> 09:14.930
How do you figure?

09:16.973 --> 09:18.566
What is this?

09:18.558 --> 09:19.480
Breakfast.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.602
But...

09:20.602 --> 09:22.900
this is a homemade
chocolate chip waffle

09:22.896 --> 09:24.694
topped with strawberries
and whipped cream

09:24.689 --> 09:26.987
and surrounded by
a bacon perimeter.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.701
Guess I was feeling creative.

09:30.737 --> 09:35.208
Oh, Bobby, your father and I
feel so bad about last night.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.793
We lost track of time,

09:36.785 --> 09:39.459
and, well, your father
just had to have this lava cake.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.958
So you're saying
this is Dad's fault?

09:44.959 --> 09:47.212
We could spend all day
pointing fingers at your father,

09:47.212 --> 09:49.840
but would that
solve anything, Bobby?

09:49.839 --> 09:50.931
Comics?

09:58.515 --> 09:59.687
Well, all right.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.649
Morning, Bobby.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.855
Morning... Father.

10:06.147 --> 10:09.196
Make way for some hot syrup!

10:12.987 --> 10:15.240
Thanks, Mom.

10:17.992 --> 10:21.166
That meal was
unnecessarily decadent.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.005
It was a breakfast bribe.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.920
She's trying
to make me the scapegoat.

10:24.916 --> 10:25.963
Hey, Hank Hill!

10:25.959 --> 10:29.213
I knew rednecks abandoned
cars and refrigerators.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.214
Guess we can throw kids
on the list, too.

10:32.966 --> 10:33.967
Ah, dang it!

10:33.967 --> 10:35.765
Peggy told Minh, didn't she?

10:35.760 --> 10:38.980
She's gonna sell me out
to the entire neighborhood.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.185
Sweet, helpless Hank,

10:43.184 --> 10:45.562
you wouldn't last
one day in the wild.

10:48.439 --> 10:51.989
Any skilled outdoorsman knows
the female of a species

10:51.985 --> 10:54.488
is always the most fierce
and calculating.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.489
That's why you never
fight a lady monkey.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.991
Yeah, Peggy Hill savage.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.164
She going to turn
your son against you...

11:00.160 --> 11:03.289
Unless you match her
bribe for bribe.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.962
You expect me to bribe my son?

11:05.957 --> 11:06.549
Bribe!

11:08.751 --> 11:10.924
Uh, hey, there, Bobby.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.632
About last night, uh...

11:14.632 --> 11:17.727
see, the thing is,
I was all ready to leave

11:17.719 --> 11:20.142
when your mother ordered
a cup of coffee.

11:21.806 --> 11:25.151
I'm not trying to say your
mother is responsible for this.

11:25.143 --> 11:29.523
In fact, that's what
I'm trying very hard not to say.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.149
Uh-huh.

11:33.651 --> 11:34.903
Uh...

11:34.903 --> 11:37.702
Hey, uh, why don't
you hit the arcade.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.370
Go shoot yourself some...

11:39.365 --> 11:41.242
zombies and such.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.540
Um... okay.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.788
Thanks.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.789
Enjoy, Bobby. On me.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.416
Your dad.

11:52.462 --> 11:56.558
First a five-star breakfast
and now free cash?

11:56.549 --> 11:59.723
Dude, your parents are
competing for your love!

11:59.719 --> 12:01.972
You're like a child of divorce!

12:01.971 --> 12:05.896
Wow! I didn't know kids with
divorced parents had it so good.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.982
Oh, it's a sweet gig.

12:07.977 --> 12:11.732
My mom and dad are trying
to prove who loves me more.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.359
What should I ask for next?

12:14.359 --> 12:16.282
The Cane Skretteburg concert.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.779
This Saturday night!

12:17.779 --> 12:22.000
It'll be wild and loud
and overflowing with chicks!

12:21.991 --> 12:24.744
My parents would
never let me go to that.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.167
It's perfect!

12:27.163 --> 12:30.463
Unlike the majestic
North American cow,

12:30.458 --> 12:33.257
I can't subsist on grass alone.

12:33.253 --> 12:37.554
I'm going to need to hunt
for food if I want to live.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.175
And I do.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.440
Sh-sha!

12:45.431 --> 12:46.899
Sh-shal

12:55.984 --> 12:58.237
Dang it, she made him nachos?

13:05.994 --> 13:07.667
Come in.

13:07.662 --> 13:08.879
Hey, Bobby.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.920
Did you have a good time
with the money I gave you?

13:11.916 --> 13:13.589
Eh. Guess I'm
just feeling

13:13.584 --> 13:16.303
a little down today, you know?
Well, sure.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.719
Your mother
chose coffee over you.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.183
That would upset anyone.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.518
Oh, I can't stay mad at her.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.387
She does so many little things

13:24.387 --> 13:26.731
to let me know
how much she cares.

13:26.723 --> 13:30.478
Uh, is there maybe one
big thing someone might do

13:30.476 --> 13:32.570
to show you they care?

13:32.562 --> 13:33.859
No.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.232
Unless...

13:35.231 --> 13:38.451
Well, there's a thing
I was hoping to go to

13:38.443 --> 13:40.946
on Saturday night, but... What?

13:40.945 --> 13:42.367
Well, it's a rock concert,

13:42.363 --> 13:45.458
and I'd need to stay out
a little past curfew.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.953
Guess I'll just ask Mom.

13:47.952 --> 13:48.999
We don't need her.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.121
How much past curfew?

13:50.121 --> 13:51.998
The concert would probably end

13:51.998 --> 13:55.377
at about the same time
I was being offered marijuana

13:55.376 --> 13:57.970
at the Get In/Get Out
the other night.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.760
Oh. Uh...

13:59.756 --> 14:02.976
Well, if it's really
important to you...

14:02.967 --> 14:06.221
And I've been thinking,
maybe I should get a new bike.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.973
You know, something that
could safely deliver me home

14:08.973 --> 14:12.273
when there's no one
I could count on to pick me up.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.942
I'm, uh...

14:16.981 --> 14:19.655
I-I’ll be back.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.452
I think this looks
about right for my son.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.955
Okay, so, do I
wheel it up front?

14:31.954 --> 14:34.753
Hank! What are
you doing here?

14:34.749 --> 14:35.420
Peggy!

14:35.416 --> 14:36.963
Uh... nothing.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.836
What are you doing here?

14:38.836 --> 14:41.965
Well, I... I also
am here for nothing.

14:41.964 --> 14:45.184
Wait. Are you buying
Bobby a bike?

14:45.176 --> 14:48.271
That depends... are you buying
him a cart full of toys?

14:48.262 --> 14:50.981
Are you
accusing me of bribery?

14:50.973 --> 14:52.975
Are you guilty of bribery?

14:52.975 --> 14:54.727
I...

14:54.727 --> 14:57.981
Oh, Hank, I feel so awful.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.903
I neglected
our sweet little Bobby.

15:00.066 --> 15:03.536
He needed me,
and I was not there for him.

15:03.528 --> 15:06.873
Ah, yeah, we
both messed up, but...

15:06.864 --> 15:08.582
spoiling him with
ridiculous gifts

15:08.574 --> 15:10.952
isn't gonna make things better.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.169
Oh, you're right.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.584
This all started
because of our date night!

15:14.580 --> 15:17.083
He just wanted
to spend some time with us,

15:17.083 --> 15:19.177
and we excluded him.

15:20.962 --> 15:23.806
I know what we have to do.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.971
So... we're
getting the bike?

15:25.967 --> 15:27.435
Not getting the bike?

15:27.427 --> 15:28.974
What am I doing?

15:28.970 --> 15:32.975
Joseph, a lesser man would have
stopped at concert tickets.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.147
But I, being a dreamer,

15:35.143 --> 15:38.238
sent both my parents
on a shopping spree.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.783
Pardon me a moment.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.408
Um, hey,

15:46.404 --> 15:49.408
you guys need help
unloading anything?

15:49.407 --> 15:52.877
The cars are empty, Bobby,
but we are not empty-handed.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.964
In fact, we got you
something very special.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.842
Us!

15:59.834 --> 16:02.963
You? You're giving me you?

16:02.962 --> 16:04.964
All you wanted was
to be with your parents.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.888
Well, Bobby,
consider that wish granted.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.933
We promise never to leave
you alone ever again!

16:11.095 --> 16:14.315
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever!

16:23.774 --> 16:25.993
...and five, six, seven!

16:25.985 --> 16:28.283
Well, how about that!

16:28.279 --> 16:31.374
Looks like I'm spending
the night at the Hotel Bobby.

16:31.365 --> 16:34.744
My Triple-A card is registered
in the name of Hank Hill,

16:34.744 --> 16:36.997
though I'm currently
traveling as a shoe.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.670
Will that be a problem,
Mr. Hotel Manager?

16:52.970 --> 16:54.972
Good morning, Bobby!

16:55.806 --> 16:56.932
How'd you sleep?

16:56.933 --> 16:58.150
Did you miss us? Ooh!

16:58.142 --> 16:59.519
We missed you!

16:59.519 --> 17:00.987
Well, I barely slept at all.

17:00.978 --> 17:03.276
I was too excited
about all the things

17:03.272 --> 17:05.569
we're gonna do today
as a family.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.988
More family stuff?

17:06.983 --> 17:09.487
Last night didn't get it
out of your system?

17:09.487 --> 17:11.410
Are you kidding? We're
just getting warmed up.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.998
Okay, here's the thing:

17:12.990 --> 17:16.415
Hanging out with you guys
is all kinds of great,

17:16.410 --> 17:19.003
but tonight's the concert
at the Funzone.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.589
A rock concert?

17:20.580 --> 17:22.424
Bobby, there's nothing fun

17:22.415 --> 17:24.009
about going to a rock concert...

17:25.711 --> 17:27.213
...without your

17:27.213 --> 17:29.932
parents!
Oh, God!

17:45.898 --> 17:49.402
In the wild, there is
no greater survival skill...

17:49.402 --> 17:50.870
Dale,

17:50.861 --> 17:52.989
did you steal this stuff
from the neighbors?

17:52.989 --> 17:56.368
No. I trekked through the wild
and foraged for it.

17:56.367 --> 17:57.994
Ugh.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.167
There is no
greater survival skill

18:00.162 --> 18:03.883
than the ability to start a fire
without matches.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.883
Lucky for me,
the Arlen plains are rich

18:07.878 --> 18:10.882
in natural
propane tank deposits.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.474
Come on...

18:23.352 --> 18:25.354
Can you feel the electricity?

18:25.354 --> 18:27.948
We are gonna rock it
hard-core tonight!

18:27.940 --> 18:30.489
What do we do till
the show starts?

18:33.821 --> 18:34.947
You know,

18:35.114 --> 18:37.663
there's an arcade game
I want to play,

18:37.658 --> 18:41.413
but I just remembered,
it's a one-player game, so...

18:41.412 --> 18:43.881
I'll have to play by myself.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.467
I'll check you later.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.802
Whew!

18:49.712 --> 18:51.714
It's awful, Joseph.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.637
My only moment of privacy today

18:53.633 --> 18:55.931
was in the bathroom...
And even then,

18:55.926 --> 18:58.896
my mom sat outside
the door and sang to me.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.978
Dude, that's pretty weird.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.442
Unless... What song was it?

19:03.434 --> 19:05.903
Hey, Bobby! Look at me!
Bobby!

19:06.062 --> 19:08.281
I'm skiing! Bobby!

19:12.401 --> 19:14.244
Oh! What happened?
Did you win?

19:14.236 --> 19:16.238
Are you dead? Those
trees are so blurry.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.956
I think you're
going light-speed!

19:19.992 --> 19:21.164
Hey, Bobby.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.207
Joseph said you're going

19:22.203 --> 19:24.001
to the Cane Skretteburg concert.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.000
We should headbang when
they play "Screeching Weasel."

19:26.999 --> 19:30.173
Well, I was planning
to go to the concert, but...

19:30.169 --> 19:31.967
Hi! Peggy Hill!

19:31.962 --> 19:33.964
I love Cane Scattersmith!

19:33.964 --> 19:36.012
I also love my son, Bobby!

19:37.635 --> 19:39.854
Um... have fun.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.648
Hank! Grab Bobby's hand!

19:42.640 --> 19:44.517
We'll be a family chain!

19:46.852 --> 19:48.729
No more!
No more family time!

19:48.729 --> 19:50.276
No more following me around!

19:50.272 --> 19:52.741
I can't gotdang take it!

19:52.733 --> 19:54.986
But... you wanted
to be with us.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.454
You felt so alone;
you had nightmares.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.198
I was faking.

19:59.198 --> 20:03.248
Now, don't get me wrong,
I was upset when you forgot me.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.246
I would've gotten over it
eventually,

20:05.246 --> 20:07.749
but then I found
myself at the center

20:07.748 --> 20:10.376
of a full-blown
gift-giving competition.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.799
And that's not
a bad place to be.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.139
Your father should not
have tried to pay you off.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.553
That was wrong.
Me?

20:16.549 --> 20:20.179
Peggy, you woke up at 5:00 a.m.
to cook the boy breakfast.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.225
Only because
he was acting so upset.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.973
He wouldn't even talk to us!

20:23.973 --> 20:25.975
Because you guys left me alone

20:25.975 --> 20:29.445
in a scary parking lot
for an hour!

20:29.437 --> 20:30.984
Huh.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.574
I guess we all
made some mistakes.

20:34.984 --> 20:38.454
But if time to yourself
is what you really want...

20:49.749 --> 20:51.717
<i>Abbondanza!</i>

20:54.253 --> 20:57.302
Now I guess you're gonna
need a new shelter.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.847
Good thing you're such
a skilled outdoorsman.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.064
Okay, I quit.

21:08.809 --> 21:11.608
The skies have grown hostile.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.402
I've got a lot of work to do

21:13.397 --> 21:15.399
if I'm gonna make it
through the night.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.733
<i>So... we're getting the bike?
Not getting the bike?</i>

21:57.942 --> 21:58.943
<i>What am I doing?</i>
