WEBVTT

00:02.747 --> 00:03.545
- Hey, babe.
- Hmm?

00:03.607 --> 00:04.863
Coming to bed soon?

00:04.915 --> 00:07.032
As soon as I'm done making
Shannon's lunch for tomorrow.

00:07.084 --> 00:08.867
It's kind of like we're parents, huh?

00:08.952 --> 00:11.703
- Sending our kid off to school for the first time.
- Mm.

00:11.788 --> 00:14.039
Yeah, but instead of a cute
little kid with pigtails,

00:14.124 --> 00:17.259
it's your 16-year-old terrifying
sister with a Hello Kitty bong.

00:18.629 --> 00:20.512
Which I threw away.

00:20.547 --> 00:23.215
Look at us. Making lunches,

00:23.267 --> 00:25.217
confiscating drug paraphernalia.

00:25.269 --> 00:26.801
We are nailing parenting.

00:26.887 --> 00:28.019
Yeah, we are.

00:29.106 --> 00:31.223
All right, catch you fools later.

00:31.308 --> 00:32.557
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:32.643 --> 00:33.975
Where are you going?

00:34.061 --> 00:35.310
Meeting some friends at a club.

00:35.395 --> 00:36.611
And before you get all concerned,

00:36.697 --> 00:38.230
yes, I have my fake ID.

00:39.931 --> 00:40.899
Shannon, it's 10:30,

00:40.951 --> 00:43.702
and tomorrow is your
first day at a new school.

00:43.737 --> 00:45.403
10:30? Good point. Club'll be empty.

00:45.455 --> 00:46.823
I'll leave in an hour.

00:48.596 --> 00:49.908
You're not going anywhere.

00:49.960 --> 00:52.210
School starts earlier than
you're used to getting up.

00:52.246 --> 00:54.129
Yes. It's a time called...

00:54.214 --> 00:55.463
morning.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.500
The sun is out. The air is crisp.

00:58.585 --> 00:59.751
Birds are tweeting.

01:00.933 --> 01:02.837
Birds can't tweet.

01:03.309 --> 01:04.923
Sorry, you're staying in.

01:05.007 --> 01:06.758
But I don't even want to
go to this stupid school.

01:06.843 --> 01:07.976
Okay, first of all,

01:08.061 --> 01:10.183
Theodore Roosevelt High
School is not stupid.

01:10.218 --> 01:12.063
They have some of the
finest teachers in the city.

01:12.462 --> 01:14.099
You know what they
say about teachers, right?

01:14.151 --> 01:15.684
Okay. Those who can't...

01:15.769 --> 01:17.269
I'm a teacher.

01:18.148 --> 01:20.405
Let me finish my sentence.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.941
Those who can't do anything else...

01:22.993 --> 01:24.409
teach.

01:25.779 --> 01:27.245
Uh, Shannon,

01:27.281 --> 01:30.081
you may not be into the ancient
Greeks or anything pre-Snapchat...

01:31.868 --> 01:33.952
...but Aristotle said,
"The roots of education

01:34.004 --> 01:35.620
are bitter, but the..."

01:35.672 --> 01:37.372
Shannon, what are you doing?

01:38.205 --> 01:39.791
I'm sending a snap of this to Janelle.

01:39.843 --> 01:41.793
She's been having trouble
falling asleep recently.

01:41.845 --> 01:43.428
I thought this might help.

01:44.226 --> 01:45.297
Why do I even try?

01:45.382 --> 01:47.465
I don't know.

01:47.517 --> 01:48.883
All right, I'm going in my room.

01:48.969 --> 01:51.970
Oh, has anybody seen a
little Hello Kitty, uh...

01:52.022 --> 01:53.939
statue that I left out?

01:54.526 --> 01:55.951
A statue, huh?

01:55.986 --> 01:57.551
- Hmm.
- Didn't know you were into those.

01:57.586 --> 01:58.443
What does it look like?

01:58.478 --> 02:01.896
Well, it's got a couple,
um, statue holes and...

02:01.982 --> 02:04.316
it's got some weed in it.

02:05.194 --> 02:06.651
I threw your bong away, Shannon.

02:06.737 --> 02:10.155
And you let him, Clem? You used to
smoke all the time when you were my age.

02:10.207 --> 02:11.906
Yes, but I'm older now,

02:11.992 --> 02:14.326
and I'm telling you to do the opposite.

02:14.411 --> 02:17.545
Which is the funnest part of growing up.

02:21.334 --> 02:25.754
Right about now,
I could use that Hello Kitty statue.

02:32.846 --> 02:34.846
Hey, Nick, do you think
Shannon's gonna be okay

02:34.898 --> 02:37.182
- at her new school?
- I'll tell you what I think.

02:37.234 --> 02:39.317
I think all we ever talk
about now is Shannon.

02:39.353 --> 02:40.986
Oh, God, you're right.

02:41.021 --> 02:42.654
We're like those annoying parents

02:42.689 --> 02:45.440
who can't stop talking about
how great their kids are.

02:45.525 --> 02:49.244
Except we're not parents
and our kid sucks.

02:49.329 --> 02:52.113
You know what makes us different
than those parents? We're young,

02:52.199 --> 02:53.365
we're hot,

02:53.450 --> 02:55.617
and we do it all the time.

02:55.702 --> 02:57.452
Mmm...

02:57.537 --> 03:00.205
Do we do it all the time?

03:00.257 --> 03:02.173
We did do it all the time...

03:02.209 --> 03:05.093
till Shannon moved in.

03:06.057 --> 03:07.962
Maybe that's why we've been at
each other's throats lately.

03:08.048 --> 03:09.180
Have we?

03:09.216 --> 03:10.882
Yeah, like the other day,
you got mad at me

03:10.934 --> 03:12.050
when I accidentally broke the blender.

03:12.102 --> 03:14.552
Who puts frozen mango in
a blender with no water?

03:14.604 --> 03:16.721
That's how you make a mango shake!

03:17.941 --> 03:20.025
Look at us. We're doing it again.

03:20.060 --> 03:22.560
Yeah, 'cause, again, we're not doing it.

03:23.897 --> 03:26.197
It's hard having Shannon in our space.

03:26.233 --> 03:27.699
But tomorrow, once school starts,

03:27.734 --> 03:30.368
we're gonna get a lot of
structure back into our lives,

03:30.404 --> 03:32.037
and maybe we can...

03:32.072 --> 03:34.289
get back into our routine.

03:34.374 --> 03:36.124
Wait, you think our sex is routine?

03:36.209 --> 03:37.992
I mean, maybe steps one through four,

03:38.078 --> 03:40.161
but, I mean, come on, five through 11?

03:41.330 --> 03:44.082
How about we cut to step nine right now?

03:44.167 --> 03:46.384
Ooh. It is on.

03:47.225 --> 03:48.887
And it's gonna be the
opposite of routine.

03:49.497 --> 03:52.257
But don't worry, Daddy's still
gonna throw in the greatest hits

03:52.342 --> 03:54.104
and give Mama what she wants.

03:55.479 --> 03:56.478
Hey, guys.

03:56.563 --> 03:57.562
- Oh! Uh...
- Oh.

03:57.597 --> 03:59.097
Get a room.

03:59.149 --> 04:00.432
We're in our room.

04:00.484 --> 04:01.733
Don't you knock?

04:01.768 --> 04:02.901
I try not to.

04:02.936 --> 04:04.652
My knuckles are a little sensy.

04:05.970 --> 04:07.605
Anyway, we got any apples?

04:07.657 --> 04:10.108
Do you need an apple so that
you can make a pipe out of it?

04:10.953 --> 04:12.026
No!

04:12.112 --> 04:14.863
I need an apple
'cause you threw away my bong.

04:15.912 --> 04:16.781
Hey, Shannon...

04:16.833 --> 04:18.283
get out.

04:18.334 --> 04:21.920
- Oh, I'll just use a potato.
- Shannon...

04:21.954 --> 04:23.705
Why haven't we put a lock on this door?

04:23.790 --> 04:26.341
'Cause we've never had a Shannon before.

04:27.056 --> 04:27.842
You know what?

04:27.928 --> 04:31.131
Tomorrow morning Shannon
has to leave at 7:30.

04:31.166 --> 04:32.714
We don't have to leave until 8:00.

04:32.799 --> 04:35.967
That gives us a full 30-minute
window of opportunity.

04:36.019 --> 04:37.102
Mmm...

04:37.137 --> 04:39.104
I like what you're suggesting.

04:39.139 --> 04:40.722
A good old-fashioned...

04:40.807 --> 04:42.557
smash-and-dash.

04:46.196 --> 04:47.696
_

04:47.697 --> 04:49.481
Okay, I just saw Shannon.

04:49.533 --> 04:51.316
She's dressed for
school and ready to go.

04:51.368 --> 04:53.952
Any second now,
she'll be walking out of that room,

04:53.987 --> 04:56.454
and we will be walking into ours.

04:56.490 --> 05:01.326
Great. I got her lunch, packed her bag,
and manscaped all my business.

05:01.411 --> 05:03.328
Okay, let's separate those thoughts,

05:03.413 --> 05:05.747
- but you know what I'm saying.
- Mm-hmm.

05:07.834 --> 05:09.217
Shannon?

05:12.506 --> 05:13.755
Shannon!

05:15.000 --> 05:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:22.182 --> 05:23.481
She fell back asleep.

05:23.517 --> 05:25.665
Brushing her teeth. Standing up.

05:25.700 --> 05:26.684
You've got to see this.

05:29.331 --> 05:32.106
- _
- Shannon, what is going on?

05:32.192 --> 05:36.110
I'll tell you what's going on...
She's eating up half our time.

05:36.196 --> 05:37.278
You know what that means.

05:37.364 --> 05:38.530
No back tickles?

05:38.615 --> 05:40.865
No back tickles.

05:40.951 --> 05:42.700
Oh, Shannon, I swear to God...

05:42.786 --> 05:44.202
Should I wear the flannel?

05:44.287 --> 05:46.087
I'm not so sure about the flannel.

05:46.173 --> 05:47.872
- You're wearing the flannel.
- Yes, yes.

05:47.958 --> 05:49.507
Okay, what about breakfast?

05:49.543 --> 05:51.960
- What about it?
- You told me not to leave without eating it.

05:52.045 --> 05:54.345
Since when do you listen to us?
Don't listen to us.

05:57.632 --> 06:00.518
Oh, man, I got OJ on my shirt.

06:00.554 --> 06:01.970
- Orange goes with gray.
- Mm-hmm.

06:02.055 --> 06:03.188
It's like tie-dye.

06:04.068 --> 06:04.939
It brings the whole outfit together.

06:05.025 --> 06:06.391
The whole thing together.

06:09.779 --> 06:10.779
_

06:10.780 --> 06:13.398
If she leaves in 30 seconds, one of us

06:13.483 --> 06:15.366
can still have a positive experience.

06:16.736 --> 06:19.037
What? I'm just trying to
salvage something here.

06:19.372 --> 06:20.238
Shannon!

06:20.323 --> 06:22.907
All right, I am good to go.

06:22.959 --> 06:24.576
Now I just need shoes.

06:24.661 --> 06:26.911
Oh, now she needs shoes.
Okay, well, other people

06:26.963 --> 06:28.580
in this house have needs, too.

06:28.632 --> 06:31.082
Now I'm late for work!
Just... "I need shoes."

06:31.134 --> 06:32.060
You know, there's plenty
of shoes around this house.

06:32.136 --> 06:34.935
I've bought many shoes.
There's just pairs all in the closet.

06:34.989 --> 06:37.889
Now you can't find a pair.
This is crazy!

06:38.850 --> 06:40.758
That dude needs to get laid.

06:48.116 --> 06:51.421
Hey, hey, now,
this is what I like to see.

06:51.507 --> 06:53.890
First day of school and already
digging into the homework.

06:53.926 --> 06:56.259
You bet I am!

06:57.139 --> 06:58.845
See, I thought that I
wasn't gonna like school,

06:58.931 --> 07:01.598
but it turns out I really hate it.

07:02.180 --> 07:03.316
What you got there?

07:03.402 --> 07:05.868
Ooh, The Great Gatsby.

07:05.903 --> 07:08.271
You know, I discover something
new every time I read this book.

07:08.357 --> 07:10.357
Yeah, our homework assignment
was to read the first chapter,

07:10.442 --> 07:12.275
and I just have, like,
one question about it.

07:12.361 --> 07:16.079
- Yeah, hit me.
- What exactly happens in the first chapter?

07:18.450 --> 07:20.617
So, Rose, you're picturing our
whole wedding on the beach?

07:20.669 --> 07:21.952
She's not only picturing it,

07:22.037 --> 07:26.089
she's been going up and down Long
Island looking at sand samples.

07:27.192 --> 07:29.175
And the best part is,

07:29.261 --> 07:31.810
when the string quartet starts to play,

07:31.845 --> 07:36.433
Nick and his groomsmen will
come galloping in on horses.

07:39.145 --> 07:41.054
Whoa, Ma, don't you think you're
getting a little carried away?

07:41.139 --> 07:42.305
I mean, horses?

07:42.357 --> 07:44.808
Oh, you don't know
what "carried away" is.

07:44.860 --> 07:48.945
My mother took over every
detail of my wedding.

07:48.981 --> 07:51.481
I didn't have a say in anything.

07:51.533 --> 07:53.783
Hmm. I wonder what that's like.

07:55.537 --> 07:57.237
Oh, God, I'm sorry. That was rude.

07:57.322 --> 07:59.873
I've just been a little on edge lately.

08:00.572 --> 08:03.960
Gentlemen, would you let us ladies
have a moment alone, please?

08:03.996 --> 08:06.880
Of course, sweetheart. Come on, Nick.

08:06.965 --> 08:08.164
Hey, Dad, uh...

08:08.250 --> 08:11.384
you can talk her
out of the horses, right?

08:11.470 --> 08:13.219
That's cute, son.

08:15.307 --> 08:17.173
So, what's going on, baby?

08:17.225 --> 08:20.343
Tell Mama Rose all about it.

08:20.429 --> 08:21.928
Look, it's hard.

08:24.010 --> 08:26.016
The day after we got engaged,
Shannon moved in,

08:26.068 --> 08:28.151
and it's put a little bit of
stress on our relationship.

08:28.186 --> 08:29.436
I get it.

08:29.521 --> 08:31.855
Not long after Walt and I were married,

08:31.907 --> 08:36.743
I found the cutest little
stray cat and brought her home.

08:36.828 --> 08:38.778
Well, let me tell you,

08:38.864 --> 08:41.530
that cat got a lot of "D."

08:41.616 --> 08:43.366
You know what I mean.

08:43.452 --> 08:45.619
I really hope I don't.

08:46.095 --> 08:47.704
Diarrhea.

08:48.713 --> 08:49.706
Oh, thank God.

08:49.758 --> 08:52.258
But we got through it, together,

08:52.344 --> 08:55.211
and our relationship
was stronger for it.

08:55.297 --> 08:57.714
So, what are you trying to say?

08:57.799 --> 09:00.600
Shannon is your diarrhea cat.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.470
Ah...

09:09.945 --> 09:13.196
Look, I know having anyone new
living in your house is a challenge.

09:13.231 --> 09:14.731
Shannon's a great kid, but she...

09:14.783 --> 09:17.117
Dresses like a homeless pirate?

09:17.202 --> 09:21.071
No. I mean, well, yes,
yes, she does, but...

09:21.156 --> 09:23.957
It's just she... she's always around.

09:24.042 --> 09:25.291
I understand, son.

09:25.377 --> 09:26.409
Figured you would, Dad.

09:26.495 --> 09:28.662
- You're not getting any.
- Oh!

09:29.965 --> 09:32.248
I... don't really want to
have that conversation.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.217
I mean, you got a teenager living there,

09:34.252 --> 09:35.919
and you got some thin walls.

09:35.971 --> 09:37.137
Please, can we stop?

09:37.222 --> 09:38.922
I mean, it's fine when they're babies...

09:38.974 --> 09:41.558
They don't know what the hell's
going on in the other room.

09:41.593 --> 09:44.511
They probably think you're
fighting a bear or something.

09:44.596 --> 09:46.312
Please make it stop.

09:46.398 --> 09:49.683
You know, when you were 16,
I was starring on Broadway

09:49.768 --> 09:51.351
as the Wizard in Wicked.

09:51.436 --> 09:52.435
Remember?

09:52.521 --> 09:55.772
The Times called my performance
"a haunting tour de force."

09:55.857 --> 09:57.991
I don't think they said that, Dad.

09:58.076 --> 10:00.694
It was in the subtext. Anyway...

10:00.779 --> 10:03.246
your mother used to sneak
away from work at lunch

10:03.281 --> 10:04.914
and meet me in my dressing room.

10:04.950 --> 10:07.283
- You want to know why?
- No, I don't.

10:08.954 --> 10:10.704
- For a nooner.
- Oh! Okay.

10:10.789 --> 10:11.955
All right, all right.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.623
Conversation over. The subtext is...

10:25.520 --> 10:28.188
Hey, Clem.

10:28.273 --> 10:32.142
Am I about to be murdered?

10:32.194 --> 10:35.729
Nope. Just trying
to keep out the diarrhea cat.

10:35.814 --> 10:37.313
- Excuse me?
- We can't just let

10:37.365 --> 10:39.449
some teenager ruin our sex life.

10:39.484 --> 10:42.652
I say we do it right now
and just get it over with.

10:44.206 --> 10:45.488
Get it over with?

10:45.574 --> 10:46.823
Yep.

10:46.908 --> 10:49.159
Just plow right through.

10:49.244 --> 10:50.326
Okay.

10:50.412 --> 10:51.377
I mean, it's been a while.

10:51.463 --> 10:54.464
I was hoping for a little more romance,
but, you know, beggars.

10:56.802 --> 10:59.469
- Do you hear that?
- Not if you didn't.

10:59.504 --> 11:01.671
Guys! I'm knocking like you said,

11:01.757 --> 11:05.341
even though it's hurting
my sensy knuckles.

11:11.683 --> 11:14.017
- May we help you?
- Yep.

11:14.069 --> 11:15.852
The school gave me this form
that needs your signature.

11:15.904 --> 11:19.322
Don't read it, just sign,
and I'll be on my merry way.

11:19.357 --> 11:21.191
"Disciplinary notice.

11:21.276 --> 11:23.193
Shannon Barnes fell
asleep in history..."

11:23.245 --> 11:24.861
You fell asleep in history?

11:24.913 --> 11:28.498
"...English and math."

11:28.533 --> 11:30.583
- You fell asleep in three classes?
- Hey.

11:30.669 --> 11:32.786
It doesn't mention that
I stayed awake in bio.

11:32.871 --> 11:34.287
That's the real triumph here.

11:36.477 --> 11:38.675
Yes, congratulations for staying awake

11:38.710 --> 11:41.511
in one out of the five hours
that you were in class today.

11:41.546 --> 11:43.763
Hey, that's like 50%.

11:43.849 --> 11:45.515
No, it's not, and you would know that

11:45.550 --> 11:47.300
if you stayed awake in math.

11:48.520 --> 11:51.304
Well, great job on your first day,
Shannon.

11:51.389 --> 11:52.889
What do you have planned for day two?

11:52.974 --> 11:54.357
Vape in the girls' bathroom?

11:54.392 --> 11:56.109
Trash the teachers' lounge?

11:56.194 --> 11:58.444
Why the hell am I giving you ideas?

11:58.530 --> 12:00.730
It wasn't that bad.

12:00.816 --> 12:03.233
Dude, I stayed in school all day.
I'm trying, okay?

12:03.285 --> 12:06.119
For once in your life,
would it kill you to be on my side?

12:12.577 --> 12:17.213
So... I guess
we're putting away the plow?

12:18.750 --> 12:21.801
I can't believe she got in
trouble on the first day.

12:21.887 --> 12:23.920
I'm sorry, sweetie.

12:23.972 --> 12:26.089
If you want,
we can fight about the blender.

12:26.141 --> 12:28.641
Babe, there's no fight there.

12:28.727 --> 12:32.061
That's how you make a mango shake.

12:35.085 --> 12:36.733
Look, I got an idea.

12:36.768 --> 12:38.935
Tomorrow, while Shannon's at school,

12:38.987 --> 12:40.603
we'll skip out of work at lunchtime,

12:40.689 --> 12:43.573
come home, we'll have a nooner.

12:44.336 --> 12:45.775
A nooner?

12:45.827 --> 12:47.277
That's kinda hot.

12:47.329 --> 12:49.112
It was my dad's idea.

12:50.198 --> 12:52.615
That detail's not helping.

12:53.141 --> 12:54.417
But I'm down.

12:54.452 --> 12:56.419
It's just, I've been trying
to get a raise at work,

12:56.454 --> 12:58.955
and I'd hate for my boss to
see me taking a long lunch.

12:59.007 --> 13:00.590
Trust me, it won't take long.

13:00.625 --> 13:01.925
Nick.

13:01.960 --> 13:03.593
I'm just saying...

13:03.628 --> 13:05.128
it's been a while.

13:09.601 --> 13:10.800
Hey, John.

13:10.886 --> 13:12.101
Here are the invitations

13:12.137 --> 13:14.304
to the opening night of
the Rembrandt Exhibit.

13:14.389 --> 13:15.972
Oh, wow! These look great.

13:16.024 --> 13:17.140
Thank you, Clem.

13:17.225 --> 13:18.558
You got it.

13:18.643 --> 13:20.193
Oh, is it okay

13:20.278 --> 13:22.061
if I'm a little late
coming back from lunch?

13:22.147 --> 13:23.479
I've got a doctor's appointment.

13:23.531 --> 13:24.614
Of course.

13:24.649 --> 13:26.282
Nothing serious, I hope.

13:26.318 --> 13:29.485
Nah. Just a little, um...

13:29.571 --> 13:31.371
ear infection.

13:31.456 --> 13:33.823
Oh! There's nothing little
about an ear infection.

13:33.909 --> 13:36.042
My aunt was in London,
she went to cross the street,

13:36.127 --> 13:37.827
somebody yelled, "Look out, trolley!"

13:37.913 --> 13:39.245
But she couldn't hear it.

13:39.331 --> 13:40.797
And then, bam!

13:42.167 --> 13:44.717
Killed by an ear infection.

13:44.803 --> 13:47.637
Look, John, the truth is, my ear's fine.

13:47.672 --> 13:50.807
I've just got a personal thing.

13:50.842 --> 13:52.912
You've got an interview with
another museum, don't you?

13:52.947 --> 13:54.310
What? No.

13:54.346 --> 13:55.993
- I...
- I cannot lose you, Clem.

13:56.031 --> 13:57.847
You're the best event planner I've got.

13:57.933 --> 13:59.899
Who is it? The Whitney?

13:59.985 --> 14:01.017
The Guggenheim?

14:01.102 --> 14:03.686
- The Frick?
- John...

14:03.772 --> 14:06.155
It is the Frick, isn't it?

14:06.844 --> 14:09.158
Yes, John. It's the Frick.

14:09.194 --> 14:10.493
You don't want to work there.

14:10.528 --> 14:13.413
Let me call Katherine,
see if we can get you a raise.

14:13.498 --> 14:17.533
What? Wow. Thank you.

14:17.619 --> 14:21.838
I... still think
I need to take the interview.

14:21.873 --> 14:23.589
Ah, playing hardball.

14:23.675 --> 14:25.124
I respect that,

14:25.210 --> 14:27.877
but I think you're gonna be
very happy when you get back.

14:27.963 --> 14:30.964
Oh, you can't even imagine.

14:37.439 --> 14:41.391
All right, how you feeling, boys?

14:41.443 --> 14:44.694
You ready for some back tickling?

14:46.614 --> 14:49.399
Oh, dope.

14:49.484 --> 14:50.633
Hey, baby.

14:50.785 --> 14:51.901
Hey, baby.

14:51.987 --> 14:53.619
Oh!

14:53.705 --> 14:54.988
Shannon, what are you doing here?

14:55.073 --> 14:56.239
It is the middle of the day.

14:56.324 --> 14:57.824
I could ask you the same question,

14:57.909 --> 14:59.659
but I think it's pretty
obvious what you're doing here,

14:59.744 --> 15:01.627
you dirty dog.

15:03.465 --> 15:04.664
All right.

15:04.749 --> 15:08.418
Who's ready to rip and dip?

15:08.470 --> 15:09.752
Shannon.

15:09.838 --> 15:10.803
Shannon?

15:10.889 --> 15:12.885
- Shannon.
- Sh...

15:13.758 --> 15:15.258
So this is why you're so obsessed

15:15.310 --> 15:16.726
with me going to school,
so you can come home

15:16.761 --> 15:18.394
and smash during the day, huh?

15:21.182 --> 15:22.732
Why aren't you in school?

15:22.767 --> 15:24.650
I got sent to the principal's
office for no reason,

15:24.736 --> 15:27.937
so I stood up for myself and
I got a five-day suspension.

15:28.023 --> 15:30.490
- Five days?
- Yeah.

15:30.575 --> 15:35.111
She's gonna be in this
house for five days.

15:36.827 --> 15:38.581
You got suspended already?

15:38.616 --> 15:39.999
What is wrong with you?

15:40.085 --> 15:41.451
Oh, sure. Take the school's side.

15:41.536 --> 15:42.952
Dude, you don't even know what happened.

15:43.004 --> 15:44.537
Yes, that's exactly what I'm gonna do,

15:44.622 --> 15:47.707
because they're the school,
and you're the...

15:47.792 --> 15:50.793
reason we're not allowed
in Walgreens anymore.

15:51.870 --> 15:53.796
Whatevs.

15:53.848 --> 15:55.631
Five days?

15:55.683 --> 15:57.633
Five days, that's 120 hou...

15:57.685 --> 15:59.218
You know,
I might as well get a part-time job.

15:59.304 --> 16:01.220
You know what? I could watch
every episode of Shameless,

16:01.306 --> 16:03.272
still have time, she'd still be here.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.685
Come in, come in. I'm Principal Kersey.

16:09.770 --> 16:11.069
Have a seat.

16:11.105 --> 16:13.138
I'd offer you coffee,
but we don't have any coffee,

16:13.207 --> 16:17.109
because somebody forgot to buy coffee.

16:17.161 --> 16:20.245
Principal Kersey, before we begin,
I'd like to apologize

16:20.280 --> 16:22.581
for whatever my sister
said to get her suspended.

16:22.616 --> 16:24.333
She called me an ass.

16:24.959 --> 16:26.335
No, I didn't.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.953
I called him a dumbass.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.455
I'm so sorry.

16:30.541 --> 16:31.757
And so is my sister.

16:31.792 --> 16:34.926
Look, I know some students may
not agree with the dress code,

16:34.962 --> 16:39.297
but they cannot react disrespectfully
when they're called out for a violation.

16:39.383 --> 16:40.766
We totally agree.

16:40.801 --> 16:43.518
I didn't realize this was
over a dress code violation.

16:43.604 --> 16:46.271
Oh, yes. The code clearly
states that undergarments,

16:46.306 --> 16:50.308
such as bra straps,
must not be visible at any time.

16:50.361 --> 16:51.693
Wait. Really?

16:51.779 --> 16:55.480
However, since Shannon is new and
you all have come here to apologize,

16:55.532 --> 16:57.699
I would be willing to
waive the suspension.

16:57.785 --> 16:59.534
That means Shannon's gonna be
in school during lunchtime.

16:59.620 --> 17:01.286
Thank you, Principal Kersey.
It's been a pleasure.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.288
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

17:05.376 --> 17:07.125
- Um, quick question.
- Question? What kind of question?

17:07.161 --> 17:09.211
I thought we were done
with the questions.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.296
What harm does a bra strap do?

17:11.330 --> 17:13.298
Well, it's important that
girls not wear clothes

17:13.333 --> 17:14.665
that distract the boys from learning.

17:14.752 --> 17:15.884
You understand.

17:15.969 --> 17:17.722
Yes, we sure do understand. See ya.

17:17.738 --> 17:21.306
How is it a girl's problem
that a boy is distracted?

17:21.340 --> 17:22.641
Doesn't that seem a little sexist?

17:22.675 --> 17:25.644
Dude, it is on.

17:25.679 --> 17:28.012
I didn't write the dress code,
Ms. Barnes.

17:28.065 --> 17:29.514
I just enforce it.

17:29.566 --> 17:30.849
Let me see this.

17:30.934 --> 17:34.069
Oh, one, two, three pages for girls,

17:34.154 --> 17:36.071
and only one paragraph for boys?

17:36.156 --> 17:37.656
Why is no one worried that maybe

17:37.691 --> 17:39.357
the girls might be
distracted by the boys?

17:39.410 --> 17:42.577
If you saw the dudes here,
you'd understand.

17:42.663 --> 17:46.081
Ms. Barnes,
male students are very distractible.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.365
Yeah, well, so are girls.

17:47.418 --> 17:48.700
We think about sex, too.

17:48.786 --> 17:50.368
Yeah, we do. A lot.

17:50.454 --> 17:52.504
Especially when we're not getting any.

17:54.091 --> 17:57.709
There's been a lot of
distractions at home.

17:57.795 --> 18:00.345
We live in a different time, Mr. Kersey.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.880
I don't care what your code says.

18:01.965 --> 18:04.216
You can't treat boys and
girls differently anymore.

18:04.268 --> 18:06.435
Except for ladies' night,
when we drink for free.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.686
That's cool.

18:08.232 --> 18:10.722
I think the way my
sister dresses is fine.

18:10.774 --> 18:13.141
And with all the problems
you've got going on in schools,

18:13.227 --> 18:16.895
you're gonna focus on whether or
not someone's bra strap is showing?

18:16.947 --> 18:20.065
That, sir,
is the definition of dumbass-ery.

18:21.869 --> 18:24.402
I'm sure you realize the
suspension is back on.

18:24.488 --> 18:25.904
Yes, I do.

18:27.574 --> 18:28.602
Boom!

18:32.546 --> 18:34.079
Whoa. Shannon.

18:34.164 --> 18:36.631
What I'm about to tell you might confuse

18:36.717 --> 18:38.583
or maybe even scare you.

18:40.087 --> 18:41.670
But that thing in your hand,

18:41.755 --> 18:43.088
it's not a phone.

18:45.726 --> 18:47.592
It's a book.

18:47.644 --> 18:51.897
I know. Every time I swipe left,
it just takes you to another page.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.267
I'm proud of you, Shannon.

18:55.319 --> 18:56.902
Really, I'm impressed.

18:56.937 --> 18:59.437
Well, I really appreciate it
that you had my back today,

18:59.523 --> 19:01.273
so I decided, what the hell?

19:01.325 --> 19:05.076
Why not give this whole tedious,
soul-crushing school thing a shot?

19:05.794 --> 19:07.112
That's the spirit.

19:08.832 --> 19:11.116
Oh, cool. Janelle's having people over.

19:11.688 --> 19:12.784
Tonight?

19:14.338 --> 19:16.121
That's, uh, that-that's great,
right, Nick?

19:16.173 --> 19:18.039
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

19:18.125 --> 19:19.875
Yes. Definitely.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.960
You should go out.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.513
No.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.765
I'm staying in and reading my book.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.600
Well, don't feel like you have to.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.719
I mean, y-you got five days.

19:30.804 --> 19:33.138
Yeah, I mean, look, I mean,
you're already on page six.

19:33.223 --> 19:34.222
- Six!
- I mean, you are flying!

19:34.308 --> 19:35.473
- That's a lot.
- That's... six!

19:39.756 --> 19:42.063
Okay, uh...

19:42.149 --> 19:44.316
I just realized I'm,
like, really hungry,

19:44.368 --> 19:47.652
so I'm gonna go get a burger,
finish my book.

19:47.738 --> 19:48.870
Thank God.

19:48.956 --> 19:51.489
I mean, thank you. I mean, good for you.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.992
I'm gonna need 50 bucks.

19:54.077 --> 19:55.243
50 dollars for a burger?

19:55.329 --> 19:57.546
- Just give it to her.
- All right. Okay.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.047
No pr... Just take the whole wallet.

19:59.132 --> 20:00.832
That's fine, don't worry about it.

20:00.884 --> 20:03.335
Bye.

20:10.235 --> 20:11.451
More wine?

20:11.536 --> 20:13.570
Baby, what's gotten into you?

20:13.655 --> 20:15.155
I don't know.

20:15.240 --> 20:20.710
I was just thinking about
when I was starring in Wicked,

20:20.745 --> 20:22.712
and you used to come visit me.

20:22.747 --> 20:26.082
Oh, I'll never forget.

20:27.279 --> 20:29.335
It may be 10:00 p.m. here.

20:29.421 --> 20:31.304
Mm-hmm.

20:31.389 --> 20:33.223
But it's noon somewhere.

20:33.258 --> 20:35.391
Oh.

20:36.546 --> 20:38.094
Ah, great, you guys are home.

20:39.764 --> 20:40.980
Clem and Nick kicked me out.

20:41.066 --> 20:43.566
What you guys doing?

20:45.259 --> 20:48.071
Remember that cat we used to have?

20:49.600 --> 20:51.465
Indeed, I do.
