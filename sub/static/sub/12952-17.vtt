00:00.967 --> 00:02.101
<i>Previously on "Alias. "</i>

00:02.102 --> 00:04.570
Bomani's become the largest
arms dealer in Africa,

00:04.571 --> 00:06.772
with strong ties
to The Covenant.

00:06.773 --> 00:11.710
I could help you
become more powerful than ever.

00:13.713 --> 00:18.275
You know about The Passenger?

00:18.618 --> 00:20.552
Excuse me?

00:20.553 --> 00:22.421
The Passenger.

00:22.422 --> 00:23.789
Ugh!

00:23.790 --> 00:25.624
Dixon, it's me.
I'm at the Naval Hospital.

00:25.625 --> 00:27.593
There's a sniper.
Lazarey's been shot!

00:27.594 --> 00:29.094
Our superiors
would like to know

00:29.095 --> 00:31.595
how your efforts in securing
a scapegoat are progressing.

00:31.664 --> 00:34.394
I've already taken care of it.

00:36.102 --> 00:38.602
Jack.

00:39.072 --> 00:41.572
To what do I owe this pleasure?

00:41.741 --> 00:43.642
I take no pleasure in this,
Arvin.

00:49.749 --> 00:50.849
I've got the artifact.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.350
I'll meet you
at the rendezvous point.

00:56.556 --> 01:00.048
I know you removed an artifact
from Project: Black Hole

01:00.126 --> 01:02.626
to trade with The Covenant.

01:08.701 --> 01:10.269
Based on
recently acquired intelligence,

01:10.270 --> 01:12.271
we know Sark was promoted
to co-command

01:12.272 --> 01:14.106
The Covenant's
North American operations.

01:14.107 --> 01:16.108
Senator Reed, it's imperative

01:16.109 --> 01:18.544
we learn the identity
of his associate.

01:18.545 --> 01:19.545
I enhanced the audio.

01:19.546 --> 01:23.073
It turns out our friend Mr. Sark
made a phone call.

01:23.149 --> 01:25.811
Notify the extraction team.

01:26.286 --> 01:28.786
Not if I see you first, love.

01:29.289 --> 01:30.789
See you later?

01:30.790 --> 01:33.290
Not if I see you first, love.

01:44.204 --> 01:46.729
Lauren's parents have
been married for 34 years,

01:46.806 --> 01:48.574
and they still love
being together.

01:48.575 --> 01:51.373
I had one day off this month,
and I spent it playing hockey

01:51.444 --> 01:53.011
at the rink
with high school kids.

01:53.012 --> 01:55.512
That must be fun.

01:58.384 --> 01:59.985
<i># I worry #</i>

01:59.986 --> 02:03.319
<i># I throw my fear around #</i>

02:13.166 --> 02:15.666
If I need it,
can I crash on your couch?

02:16.736 --> 02:18.003
Yeah.

02:18.004 --> 02:20.504
You just have to wipe off
the Cheese Nips.

02:24.777 --> 02:27.277
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

02:33.253 --> 02:34.486
Hello?

02:34.487 --> 02:36.588
I may have a lead
on the box from Lot 45.

02:36.589 --> 02:37.656
Not where it is,

02:37.657 --> 02:39.725
but a map that'll lead us
to the key that opens it.

02:39.726 --> 02:42.559
Project: Black Hole has had
the Rambaldi box for two years,

02:42.629 --> 02:44.563
and hasn't been able to do that.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.999
Without the key, The Covenant
won't be able to, either.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.467
That's why we have to get it.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.369
I'm getting the intel
from Mexico City.

02:50.370 --> 02:51.837
Plane's waiting on you at Dover.

02:51.838 --> 02:55.035
- I'd like to go with him.
- Is that a good idea?

02:55.108 --> 02:56.041
Sloane was clear.

02:56.042 --> 02:59.375
Whatever is in the box presents
a significant threat to you.

02:59.445 --> 03:00.812
Sloane could be lying.

03:00.813 --> 03:03.441
Even if he's not, the box
has one inscription on it.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.516
"Irina. "

03:04.517 --> 03:06.118
I need to find out why.

03:06.119 --> 03:09.885
You'll report to me as soon as
you get back from Mexico City.

03:14.894 --> 03:17.394
Lauren.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.998
Your father has ordered
an official inquiry

03:19.999 --> 03:21.500
into the disappearance
of the box

03:21.501 --> 03:23.435
from Project: Black Hole.

03:23.436 --> 03:26.030
I've already been questioned
about what I know.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.440
Which is nothing.

03:30.343 --> 03:32.010
I appreciate that.

03:32.011 --> 03:33.679
Not at all.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.478
You know where my loyalties lie.

03:46.693 --> 03:49.890
The box you lost
has not been opened

03:49.963 --> 03:52.130
since the time of Rambaldi,

03:52.131 --> 03:54.299
though there is a legend
Joseph Stalin

03:54.300 --> 03:56.001
made the greatest effort.

03:56.002 --> 03:57.970
Stalin knew about Rambaldi?

03:57.971 --> 04:00.405
He, too, was a believer.

04:00.406 --> 04:04.604
The Rambaldi box
is of particular interest,

04:04.677 --> 04:07.544
because it was rumored
to contain the strain

04:07.614 --> 04:11.550
of a plague-like bioweapon
capable of killing millions.

04:11.618 --> 04:14.246
Stalin obtained the box.

04:14.320 --> 04:18.051
But the key to opening it
eluded him.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.618
He sent teams of archaeologists

04:22.695 --> 04:26.062
around the globe
in search of the key.

04:28.668 --> 04:32.195
As legend has it, in 1941,

04:32.272 --> 04:36.402
a discovery was made
in the Karoo desert.

04:36.976 --> 04:41.208
What they found was a map
made of crystal.

04:41.814 --> 04:43.915
The etchings in the crystal

04:43.916 --> 04:48.114
were a guide to the key
that opened the box.

04:48.187 --> 04:50.055
Unfortunately,

04:50.056 --> 04:53.822
obsessed with gaining
sole credit for the discovery,

04:53.893 --> 04:56.862
the archaeologists
turned on one another.

05:08.274 --> 05:11.539
And the map,
along with the two men,

05:11.611 --> 05:14.111
were reclaimed by the desert,

05:14.113 --> 05:17.082
never to be heard from again.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.120
Until now.

05:22.121 --> 05:24.456
I received this two days ago

05:24.457 --> 05:27.324
from a contact in South Africa.

05:27.393 --> 05:28.393
Bomani.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.262
Where are they?

05:30.263 --> 05:32.763
The Karoo desert.

05:32.799 --> 05:36.860
My contact surveilled Mr. Bomani
with a hidden camera

05:36.936 --> 05:39.996
as he discovered the bodies
of the men and the map.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.707
That's the map?

05:41.708 --> 05:43.775
There are etchings
in the crystal.

05:43.776 --> 05:45.677
A root of some kind.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.875
This bioweapon.
What do you know about it?

05:48.948 --> 05:53.476
Only that The Covenant
refers to it as The Passenger.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.120
Where is your contact now?

05:55.121 --> 05:56.455
Can we speak with him?

05:56.456 --> 05:58.956
I am afraid not.

06:00.259 --> 06:03.820
Bomani discovered
he was being surveilled.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.532
Son of a bitch.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.033
You see those trucks?

06:12.572 --> 06:15.072
Omnifam.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.275
Explain this to me.

06:17.276 --> 06:20.677
Kazari Bomani using your trucks
to do The Covenant's work.

06:20.747 --> 06:23.247
I entered into
a relationship with Bomani

06:23.282 --> 06:25.217
at the insistence of the CIA,

06:25.218 --> 06:27.652
who forced me to partner
with him

06:27.653 --> 06:29.688
so I could stay close
to The Covenant.

06:29.689 --> 06:31.857
Your job was to provide us
with intel,

06:31.858 --> 06:34.358
not offer material
assistance to The Covenant

06:34.360 --> 06:36.762
in their search
for The Passenger.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.764
In order to maintain my cover,

06:38.765 --> 06:43.202
I had to grant Bomani access
to certain Omnifam resources.

06:43.269 --> 06:45.670
Check the report, Sydney.

06:45.671 --> 06:47.272
I detailed all of this.

06:47.273 --> 06:49.773
You committed treason
by spying on your country.

06:49.776 --> 06:53.041
I won't put much stock
in your reports.

06:53.112 --> 06:55.213
I'm not the mole
you're looking for.

06:55.214 --> 06:56.448
You know what will happen

06:56.449 --> 06:58.216
if your pardon agreement
is revoked.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.717
The death penalty
that was commuted

07:00.720 --> 07:03.220
when you entered into it
will be reinstated.

07:03.289 --> 07:04.623
Then I will die knowing

07:04.624 --> 07:07.616
that I have honored
my agreement to the letter.

07:07.693 --> 07:09.227
Where is Bomani?

07:09.228 --> 07:11.890
I have no idea.

07:13.399 --> 07:16.835
But in exchange for certain
creature comforts...

07:17.403 --> 07:19.371
When I was falsely accused,

07:19.372 --> 07:23.399
I was reading "The lliad"
in the original Greek.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.976
I'm listening.

07:26.345 --> 07:28.480
All Omnifam trucks are equipped

07:28.481 --> 07:31.109
with global positioning
transponders.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.084
If I give you
the corresponding codes,

07:33.085 --> 07:36.486
you can track Bomani's
movements via satellite.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.020
You have such
a beautiful smile, Sydney.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.797
I miss it.

07:45.798 --> 07:50.030
If you're executed,
I'll be a witness.

07:51.704 --> 07:54.204
I'll smile then.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.613
So, how was your trip?

08:01.614 --> 08:03.849
It was good.

08:03.850 --> 08:06.350
Well, what happened?

08:06.986 --> 08:08.587
You know, we...

08:08.588 --> 08:10.088
We got what we needed to get,

08:10.089 --> 08:12.990
and we're just waiting
to see how it pans out.

08:18.931 --> 08:20.398
Michael.

08:20.399 --> 08:23.163
I got you something
while you were gone.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.736
Open it.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.775
I realized I forgot
the anniversary

08:30.776 --> 08:33.275
of your father's death.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.145
I felt terribly,

08:35.147 --> 08:38.412
and I wanted to do something
special to make up for it.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.821
It's the watch he gave you.

08:42.822 --> 08:45.322
I had it fixed.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.828
This isn't working.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.463
It's not?

08:51.464 --> 08:53.964
Not the watch.
Us.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.701
This isn't working for me.

08:58.437 --> 09:00.772
I'm not happy.

09:00.773 --> 09:03.174
I see.

09:03.175 --> 09:04.409
I don't know.

09:04.410 --> 09:07.379
I guess for a while,
I thought I could be again.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.983
But I don't think
that's gonna happen.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.655
I think we should separate.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.228
This is about Sydney, isn't it?

09:23.229 --> 09:24.229
No, it isn't.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.298
Did she give you an ultimatum?

09:26.299 --> 09:28.033
This is about us, our problem.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.334
She is our problem.

09:29.335 --> 09:31.570
Michael, if you're going
to destroy my life,

09:31.571 --> 09:34.369
the least you can do
is be honest about why.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.086
We have a problem.

09:58.497 --> 09:59.664
Have you been made?

09:59.665 --> 10:00.966
Of course not.

10:00.967 --> 10:03.467
If he knew I was Covenant,
he would arrest me,

10:03.469 --> 10:05.136
not break up with me.

10:05.137 --> 10:08.402
Well, he's obviously
grown tired of you.

10:08.474 --> 10:10.308
Perhaps because
of another woman?

10:10.309 --> 10:13.574
My access extends
beyond my husband.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.113
Perhaps.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.182
But Vaughn is central

10:17.183 --> 10:20.311
to the CIA's efforts
regarding The Passenger.

10:20.386 --> 10:23.719
So you must do everything
possible to keep him close.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.191
What are you proposing?

10:26.192 --> 10:28.786
The last time Sydney Bristow
induced your husband

10:28.861 --> 10:31.329
to stray from
a committed relationship,

10:31.330 --> 10:33.992
he was dating Alice Williams.

10:34.066 --> 10:36.401
When her father died...

10:36.402 --> 10:38.902
Vaughn recommitted.

10:40.606 --> 10:43.166
I am not going to kill
my father.

10:43.242 --> 10:44.976
Need I remind you
that you expressed

10:44.977 --> 10:47.245
no such compunction
about killing my father?

10:47.246 --> 10:49.047
You asked me to kill Lazarey.

10:49.048 --> 10:51.548
And now I'm asking you
to kill Senator Reed.

10:51.550 --> 10:54.050
The answer is no.

11:49.175 --> 11:50.909
Mrs. Reed,
my name is Jack Bristow.

11:50.910 --> 11:52.277
I'm here to see your husband.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.778
Please, come in.

11:56.582 --> 11:58.450
George tells me
you work with Lauren.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.784
Yes, I do.

11:59.785 --> 12:02.285
What you all do is so important.

12:02.288 --> 12:03.922
Forgive me for saying so,

12:03.923 --> 12:07.120
but I think the country's
lucky to have her, don't you?

12:07.193 --> 12:08.393
Absolutely.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.886
The omnibus reconciliation bill
is snagged on the intel budget.

12:11.964 --> 12:15.161
Can you believe that?
In this day and age.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.260
Well, I'm off to give a speech
at the central library.

12:18.337 --> 12:20.837
Olivia chairs
the largest literacy program

12:20.873 --> 12:22.307
in the country.

12:22.308 --> 12:25.744
Does more good in a year
than I do in a 6-year term.

12:25.811 --> 12:27.278
I'll be back after dinner.

12:27.279 --> 12:29.779
Remember to take your pill.

12:31.450 --> 12:33.950
It was very nice to meet you.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.623
Okay.

12:38.624 --> 12:40.792
Let's see it.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.660
What I have is a paper trail.

12:42.661 --> 12:44.996
Not definitive proof,

12:44.997 --> 12:46.931
but the beginning of what
Director Dixon and I

12:46.932 --> 12:50.561
believe to be a strong case
for the existence of a mole.

12:51.303 --> 12:53.803
Other than Sloane?

12:54.573 --> 12:55.840
Or instead of him.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.575
At this point, that is unclear.

12:57.576 --> 13:00.374
Is it that hard to identify
a traitor?

13:00.446 --> 13:05.679
Honestly, sometimes I think
you people just get too close.

13:13.392 --> 13:14.692
I don't understand.

13:14.693 --> 13:18.629
Unauthorized by either
NSC or Central Intelligence.

13:18.697 --> 13:20.732
Covert ops often go unrecorded.

13:20.733 --> 13:23.201
60% of the flights listed

13:23.202 --> 13:25.303
coincide with dates
and locations

13:25.304 --> 13:28.705
where verifiable
Covenant activity occurred.

13:32.778 --> 13:34.846
My daughter is
a committed public servant

13:34.847 --> 13:39.284
who, despite my objections,
insisted on government service

13:39.351 --> 13:41.786
because she felt
the responsibility

13:41.787 --> 13:43.555
to give back to her country.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.356
I understand this is difficult.

13:45.357 --> 13:47.917
No, it's not.
Because there is nothing here.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.587
Lauren is a patriot.

13:50.663 --> 13:54.030
And I will not allow you
to ruin her reputation

13:54.099 --> 13:57.535
based on innuendo
and supposition.

13:57.603 --> 13:59.771
As I said...

13:59.772 --> 14:02.272
...my findings are preliminary.

14:04.109 --> 14:05.577
These are duplicates.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.445
If, after reviewing them
more thoroughly,

14:07.446 --> 14:10.506
you have any questions, call me.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.518
Based on the transponder codes
Sloane gave us,

14:13.519 --> 14:15.053
Marshall tracked
the Omnifam trucks

14:15.054 --> 14:17.852
to the Russian consulate
at Gaborone.

14:17.923 --> 14:20.091
The consulate general,
Petr Berezovsky,

14:20.092 --> 14:22.060
has strong ties to The Covenant.

14:22.061 --> 14:24.655
Upon your arrival, there'll be
a state event in progress.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.664
You will proceed
to the second floor,

14:26.665 --> 14:29.930
where we believe Sark and Bomani
may be analyzing the map.

14:30.502 --> 14:32.470
The second floor
of the consulate

14:32.471 --> 14:34.339
is like a vault.

14:34.340 --> 14:36.840
Satellite-resistant shielding.
Copper-lined walls.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.610
Electrically conductive
concrete.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.612
This is where you think
the map is located?

14:40.613 --> 14:42.146
How do we gain access?

14:42.147 --> 14:44.911
Sydney will be going in
as a Russian couture designer

14:44.984 --> 14:46.818
interested in the local
diamond trade.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.786
Vaughn, you and Weiss
will run backup.

14:48.787 --> 14:51.756
Marshall's analyzing the
security system and passwords.

14:51.824 --> 14:54.657
He will brief you
on countermeasures and op-tech.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.227
You leave in one hour.

15:04.169 --> 15:06.967
Okay, Mountaineer.
Comms are hot.

15:07.039 --> 15:08.506
I'm entering the party.

15:08.507 --> 15:10.341
Copy.
Now locate Berezovsky.

15:18.951 --> 15:19.951
I see him.

15:19.952 --> 15:21.352
Firing up the microphone.

15:21.353 --> 15:23.521
This choker
you're wearing will get you

15:23.522 --> 15:24.522
to the second floor,

15:24.523 --> 15:27.219
because the elevator controls
are password-operated by voice,

15:27.293 --> 15:29.360
so you're gonna have
to talk like Berezovsky.

15:29.361 --> 15:31.663
I designed a high-resolution
miniature microphone

15:31.664 --> 15:33.665
that I placed inside
of the choker.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.000
The password is "mockingbird. "
In Russian.

15:36.001 --> 15:37.669
That will be easy
to get him to say.

15:37.670 --> 15:38.670
You won't have to.

15:38.671 --> 15:42.129
I designed a voice-construction
software program

15:42.207 --> 15:44.409
that will allow you to
reconstruct the password

15:44.410 --> 15:47.379
once Sydney gets Berezovsky to
say enough phonemes.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.814
Piece of cake, right?

15:49.815 --> 15:51.482
I'm Paulina Alexandrova.

15:51.483 --> 15:53.983
Yes, Madison Avenue.

16:02.861 --> 16:05.659
This guy sounds like a frog.
Is this thing gonna work?

16:05.731 --> 16:08.231
I don't know.
We'll find out.

16:08.233 --> 16:10.733
<i>Da.</i>

16:11.136 --> 16:13.104
On my way in, Syd.

16:13.105 --> 16:15.173
I'll reconstruct the password
and have it uplinked

16:15.174 --> 16:17.674
by the time
you reach the elevator.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.210
Okay, stay sharp.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.512
Sark and Bomani
could be upstairs.

16:21.513 --> 16:23.514
With our
computer scan of the map,

16:23.515 --> 16:26.313
we have narrowed our search
to a radius of 100 square miles.

16:26.385 --> 16:28.319
The rendering should
pinpoint the location

16:28.320 --> 16:30.820
by this time tomorrow.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.590
Well done.
Thank you.

16:44.303 --> 16:46.671
The guards are doing
a 2-minute sweep.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.639
Bomani and Sark might be
in the building.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.734
The elevator will take
you to the second floor.

16:51.810 --> 16:54.310
You might run into
Sark and Bomani.

16:56.582 --> 16:57.782
It's no good.

16:57.783 --> 17:00.283
Got it.
Let me try something.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.755
Gun.

17:05.457 --> 17:07.258
Try it now.

17:07.259 --> 17:08.792
No, it's still red.

17:08.794 --> 17:11.319
Watch it. Got a guard
approaching from the south.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.567
I think I got it.
Try again.

17:20.906 --> 17:23.406
We're on our way up.

17:23.442 --> 17:25.910
You will go to Vienna
and get everything ready.

17:25.911 --> 17:28.346
I will meet you there,
and we'll retrieve the key.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.847
Very well.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.957
Well, that was extravagant.

17:39.958 --> 17:42.893
I trust no one, Mr. Sark.

17:43.462 --> 17:46.124
And it is best
you remember that.

17:53.439 --> 17:55.939
There it is.

17:59.545 --> 18:01.612
We're in.
Whoa, whoa!

18:01.613 --> 18:03.648
It looks like you
triggered a silent alarm.

18:03.649 --> 18:05.049
Get the crystal and get out.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.986
Yes?

18:08.987 --> 18:11.487
Somebody's here.

18:12.791 --> 18:15.291
Got it.

18:23.168 --> 18:25.668
Go!

18:46.725 --> 18:49.225
Take my gun.

18:55.501 --> 18:56.601
We're going over.

18:56.602 --> 18:59.102
- Ready?
- Ready.

19:13.285 --> 19:14.919
They have the crystal.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.420
I'll get them.

19:23.695 --> 19:26.195
The Covenant may have
discovered how to read this.

19:26.198 --> 19:27.798
Even if we figure out
where it leads,

19:27.799 --> 19:29.267
Bomani may get there first.

19:29.268 --> 19:31.269
Dixon forwarded the picture
of the crystal

19:31.270 --> 19:32.737
on to Project: Black Hole.

19:32.738 --> 19:35.730
I'll call and ask if they have
the device that can read it.

19:45.150 --> 19:47.650
Lauren and I are separating.

19:51.456 --> 19:54.254
When we get home,
I'm on Weiss' couch.

19:57.696 --> 20:00.688
Are you sure that's
what you really want?

20:01.833 --> 20:04.333
It is.

20:33.599 --> 20:34.765
Can I help you, Ms. Reed?

20:34.766 --> 20:36.801
Run a check
against a user account.

20:36.802 --> 20:39.302
Number D Y692.

20:41.206 --> 20:42.974
I'm sorry.
Those records are sealed.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.775
I have S.C.I.
Level-nine clearance.

20:44.776 --> 20:46.811
You can check
with the office of security.

20:46.812 --> 20:49.312
- Protocol.
- I understand.

20:49.381 --> 20:51.881
Here we go.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.454
Jack Bristow accessed my files.

20:56.455 --> 20:59.390
My intrusion-detection program
logged his user account.

20:59.458 --> 21:02.052
What information was
he interested in specifically?

21:02.127 --> 21:04.228
My travel itinerary
for the last five months.

21:04.229 --> 21:05.963
Expense reports,
rental car receipts.

21:05.964 --> 21:07.465
My phone logs.

21:07.466 --> 21:09.100
I can't risk being exposed.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.626
Well, then I strongly
suggest you reconsider

21:11.703 --> 21:13.871
eliminating your father.

21:13.872 --> 21:15.940
How will that help
this situation?

21:15.941 --> 21:18.466
We can associate him
with the breaches.

21:18.543 --> 21:22.172
If you have another suggestion,
now is the time to make it.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.417
Good.

21:26.418 --> 21:28.918
Then we're agreed.

21:31.390 --> 21:32.823
It operates under

21:32.824 --> 21:34.792
the same principles
as a kaleidoscope.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.128
It contains loose pieces
of colored glass

21:37.129 --> 21:39.859
reflected by mirrors
set at certain angles

21:39.931 --> 21:42.661
that create patterns when viewed
through the end of the tube.

21:42.734 --> 21:44.335
In this case,
the pattern is a map.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.237
Made up of three crystals.

21:46.238 --> 21:48.639
All of which are required
to properly read the map.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.274
Sloane had collected only two.

21:50.275 --> 21:52.869
Now that we have all three,
what does the map look like?

21:52.944 --> 21:55.444
Check it out.

21:55.614 --> 21:57.048
Do we know where that is?

21:57.049 --> 21:59.483
I ran the image through
every known land chart.

21:59.484 --> 22:02.180
I adjusted for erosion,
acid rain, natural disaster.

22:02.254 --> 22:03.788
I couldn't find a match.

22:03.789 --> 22:05.056
The map revealed nothing?

22:05.057 --> 22:07.391
Not to me, sir.
Sorry.

22:07.392 --> 22:09.727
Based on your intel,
we were able to acquire

22:09.728 --> 22:11.595
what we were looking for
from Bomani.

22:11.596 --> 22:13.264
I'm happy I could help.

22:13.265 --> 22:14.365
The problem is,

22:14.366 --> 22:17.358
we can't interpret
the data it generated.

22:21.406 --> 22:22.940
Ah.

22:22.941 --> 22:25.309
Excellent.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.810
"The lliad. "

22:28.480 --> 22:31.472
So, how may I be of service?

22:37.122 --> 22:38.723
You found the third crystal.

22:38.724 --> 22:41.224
Thank you.

22:44.162 --> 22:46.662
Tell us what you see.

22:49.601 --> 22:52.764
Rambaldi encrypted
many of his discoveries.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.739
Or divided them into pieces

22:54.740 --> 22:57.675
so that if the authorities
discovered any single piece,

22:57.743 --> 23:01.235
the true meaning of his work
would not be revealed.

23:01.313 --> 23:03.447
That's true of the crystals.

23:03.448 --> 23:05.116
And the keys they lead to.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.051
- Keys?
- Disks, to be precise.

23:07.052 --> 23:11.318
There are four disks that
fit perfectly into the slots

23:11.390 --> 23:13.057
carved into the Rambaldi box.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.583
We know the crystals are a map.
We don't know to where.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.762
What you've been
looking at doesn't sync up

23:17.763 --> 23:19.497
to any known topography.

23:19.498 --> 23:21.198
You know better
than anyone, Sydney.

23:21.199 --> 23:22.666
There isn't anywhere on Earth

23:22.667 --> 23:24.602
that Rambaldi
or his followers wouldn't go

23:24.603 --> 23:27.197
to hide one of his creations.

23:27.272 --> 23:30.537
We've looked
everywhere on Earth.

23:30.942 --> 23:33.536
Really, Marcus?
Have you?

23:34.613 --> 23:37.810
Or is it simply that you've
looked everywhere on land?

23:37.883 --> 23:40.943
Okay, now this
is what I was looking at.

23:41.019 --> 23:42.953
It's your basic land mass.

23:42.954 --> 23:43.954
But then...

23:43.955 --> 23:48.790
if I compare the topography
with oceanic mapping...

23:51.363 --> 23:53.831
Sloane is a genius.

23:53.832 --> 23:56.133
I mean,
an evil, horrible genius.

23:56.134 --> 23:57.234
Bad man.

23:57.235 --> 23:58.836
But still a genius.

23:58.837 --> 24:01.337
The Yonaguni rock formation
off the coast of Okinawa.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.240
I want you two
in flight immediately.

24:03.241 --> 24:05.709
There's time to spec out
the mission en route.

24:05.710 --> 24:08.975
Op-tech will be waiting for you
when you land.

24:09.548 --> 24:10.748
Senator Reed called.

24:10.749 --> 24:12.983
He's reviewed the documents
and wants to meet.

24:12.984 --> 24:15.453
We owed him the courtesy
of informing him in advance.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.154
As soon as your conversation
is complete,

24:17.155 --> 24:20.682
we need to inform the FBI
and have her taken into custody.

24:30.035 --> 24:32.535
Hello, Father.

24:33.338 --> 24:35.406
I didn't hear you come in.

24:35.407 --> 24:38.535
I've been here a while
talking to Mom.

24:38.610 --> 24:41.110
Shut the door.

24:41.413 --> 24:43.848
There's something
we need to discuss

24:43.849 --> 24:46.511
that I don't want
your mom to hear.

24:46.585 --> 24:49.349
She's a great woman, your mom.

24:49.921 --> 24:51.489
Put up with a lot.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.756
Me being away.

24:52.757 --> 24:55.257
Congress all these years.

24:55.293 --> 24:56.360
It's a burden.

24:56.361 --> 24:58.861
Don't think I don't know it.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.497
On you, too.

25:01.867 --> 25:03.901
It'd break your mother's heart

25:03.902 --> 25:06.928
if she ever found out
about this.

25:09.875 --> 25:14.039
I know because it broke mine.

25:15.547 --> 25:17.081
If it's any consolation,

25:17.082 --> 25:20.779
I believe the cause
I am working for is just.

25:20.852 --> 25:24.151
I feel like I let you down.

25:24.222 --> 25:28.090
Like it's my fault,

25:28.159 --> 25:30.719
and that if I help you
get out of it,

25:30.795 --> 25:35.061
we could start over somehow.

25:35.634 --> 25:37.301
Get out of it?

25:37.302 --> 25:39.303
I could tell the Agency

25:39.304 --> 25:43.331
I had learned there was a mole
in the Rotunda six months ago,

25:43.408 --> 25:48.744
and that I've been conducting
my own investigation.

25:48.813 --> 25:52.340
I'm a Senator
on the Intelligence Committee.

25:52.417 --> 25:54.917
No one would say a word.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.054
You would do that for me?

26:03.595 --> 26:06.095
Of course I would.

26:06.731 --> 26:09.231
I love you.

26:11.736 --> 26:16.435
It's a clever plan,
and I'll definitely use it.

26:17.142 --> 26:20.134
However, it only solves
one of my problems.

26:22.180 --> 26:24.680
Lauren, what are you doing?

26:26.851 --> 26:28.352
Get on your knees.

26:28.353 --> 26:29.520
You can't do this.

26:29.521 --> 26:32.021
Get on your knees.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.092
Hands behind your head.

26:37.195 --> 26:39.695
Do as I say!

26:40.832 --> 26:43.665
Lauren, please, don't do this.

26:54.579 --> 26:57.079
God, what are you doing?

26:57.515 --> 27:00.015
Give me the gun, Lauren.

27:10.362 --> 27:13.092
Sark said you might back out.

27:20.438 --> 27:22.938
Send them up.

28:09.888 --> 28:12.388
I'm so sorry.

28:13.224 --> 28:15.724
Tell me what happened.

28:17.462 --> 28:20.090
I'd been out shopping,
and I...

28:20.899 --> 28:23.399
I came back, and...

28:23.802 --> 28:26.203
...George was there.

28:26.204 --> 28:30.231
He was just sitting,
gazing out the window.

28:30.308 --> 28:31.875
He started talking,

28:31.876 --> 28:34.211
saying something
about our country.

28:34.212 --> 28:37.579
That our government
was ineffectual.

28:37.649 --> 28:40.743
He said he'd made
certain choices.

28:42.520 --> 28:45.455
That when they came out,
no one would understand.

28:45.790 --> 28:49.692
I told him
whatever was going on...

28:51.029 --> 28:53.529
...we could get through it.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.634
He said Lauren
would be implicated, too,

28:57.635 --> 28:59.870
that he'd asked her
to do things...

28:59.871 --> 29:03.602
I don't know,
access records on his behalf.

29:03.942 --> 29:06.775
I went to the kitchen,
and that's...

29:06.845 --> 29:09.345
That's when I heard the shot.

29:12.817 --> 29:14.818
I mean, I'm his wife.

29:14.819 --> 29:17.319
I should have known.

29:18.857 --> 29:21.382
These people
he was talking about.

29:21.459 --> 29:22.960
The Covenant.

29:22.961 --> 29:27.660
He made it sound like
they were terrorists.

29:29.868 --> 29:31.535
Mom.

29:31.536 --> 29:34.036
Oh, my God.

29:36.074 --> 29:38.574
I'm sorry.

30:10.675 --> 30:14.236
All right, Mountaineer,
just course 6 degrees southwest.

30:27.725 --> 30:28.859
Target acquired.

30:28.860 --> 30:31.360
They'll be out of radio contact
until they resurface.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.614
What is this place?

30:50.615 --> 30:52.683
Looks like it's been
fortified over the years.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.618
Probably by the followers
of Rambaldi

30:54.619 --> 30:57.816
to protect his artifacts
from ever being removed.

30:57.889 --> 31:00.585
Well, next time they'll have to
do a better job.

31:01.025 --> 31:03.293
What's that?

31:03.294 --> 31:04.895
I'm not sure.

31:04.896 --> 31:06.163
What is that?

31:06.164 --> 31:08.664
Hold on a second.
I'll enhance.

31:09.767 --> 31:11.335
It's a helicopter.

31:11.336 --> 31:12.870
With divers.
Four of them, sir.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.396
Syd, Vaughn.
You've got four incoming bogeys.

31:15.473 --> 31:17.074
I repeat, four bogeys.
Do you copy?

31:17.075 --> 31:19.575
As long as they're in that cave,
the signal's down.

31:21.279 --> 31:23.313
These never have to
see the surface.

31:23.314 --> 31:24.248
What do you mean?

31:24.249 --> 31:26.683
If what's in the Rambaldi box
is a danger to you,

31:26.684 --> 31:28.652
and these keys are the only
way to open it,

31:28.653 --> 31:31.153
maybe they should be destroyed.

31:31.689 --> 31:34.189
Thank you for saying that.

31:35.093 --> 31:37.593
Put down your weapon.

31:41.532 --> 31:44.433
I could never have found these
without your help.

31:44.502 --> 31:47.002
I thank you for that.

31:47.272 --> 31:49.673
You remind me of your mother.

31:49.674 --> 31:51.541
I'm sure she would be
pleased to know

31:51.542 --> 31:53.277
I got the keys from you.

31:53.278 --> 31:57.647
After all,
The Passenger is Irina's legacy.

31:59.617 --> 32:02.117
Bring me the satchel.

32:42.393 --> 32:44.893
Bomani's got the keys.

32:47.198 --> 32:48.699
Vaughn, our hose has been cut.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.067
The DPV's shot.

32:50.068 --> 32:52.169
How long can you hold
your breath?

32:52.170 --> 32:53.937
A free swim?

32:53.938 --> 32:56.239
No way. We'd never make it
out of the tunnel.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.341
It's too far.

32:57.342 --> 32:58.642
We don't have a choice.

32:58.643 --> 33:01.612
There's got to be something
in here we can use.

33:01.679 --> 33:04.179
There.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.050
The tank's full.

33:07.051 --> 33:08.552
The regulator's broken.

33:08.553 --> 33:10.387
It's compressed air.

33:10.388 --> 33:11.955
If we could release it properly,

33:11.956 --> 33:14.456
it can act
as a propulsion device.

33:21.566 --> 33:24.066
Hang on.

33:31.542 --> 33:32.909
There they are.

33:32.910 --> 33:34.144
How can you be sure?

33:34.145 --> 33:36.978
The tracker they're wearing
emits a specific GPS frequency.

33:59.037 --> 34:02.006
Nothing on the satellite feed
or from Naval Intelligence.

34:02.073 --> 34:03.940
It's like Bomani
just disappeared.

34:03.941 --> 34:06.603
And took the key
to The Passenger with him.

34:13.184 --> 34:15.684
Vaughn.

34:19.090 --> 34:21.324
I am sad for you.

34:21.324 --> 34:23.760
For you and Lauren.

34:23.761 --> 34:26.286
That you have to go
through this.

34:28.699 --> 34:31.259
But I'm also hopeful.

34:34.438 --> 34:36.938
That's what scares me.

34:40.445 --> 34:42.945
I understand.

34:57.228 --> 34:59.728
When we get home...

35:03.668 --> 35:06.193
...you want to get
a cup of coffee?

35:12.176 --> 35:14.676
Yeah.

35:15.079 --> 35:17.280
I want to extend my condolences

35:17.281 --> 35:19.781
on behalf of
the entire task force.

35:19.817 --> 35:21.485
Thank you.

35:21.486 --> 35:23.986
I have arranged
to make grief counseling

35:23.988 --> 35:25.989
available at your convenience.

35:25.990 --> 35:28.490
And a leave of absence
should you want one.

35:30.695 --> 35:33.195
What's this?

35:33.898 --> 35:36.398
My letter of resignation.

35:37.802 --> 35:41.169
My actions violated the oath
I took to this country

35:41.239 --> 35:43.739
and your trust.

35:43.941 --> 35:46.466
Agents were put at risk
because of what I did.

35:46.544 --> 35:48.345
Your behavior,
while unacceptable,

35:48.346 --> 35:50.480
is nevertheless understandable.

35:50.481 --> 35:53.245
You were acting
at your father's instruction

35:53.317 --> 35:55.018
in accordance
with what you believed

35:55.019 --> 35:57.020
was approved
government protocol.

35:57.021 --> 35:59.922
He told you he was conducting
an independent security check,

35:59.991 --> 36:01.992
and you had no reason
to believe otherwise.

36:07.131 --> 36:12.091
Many of us have suffered tragedy
on the job or at home.

36:12.904 --> 36:16.237
When that happens,
we pull together.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.804
This time will be no exception.

36:20.878 --> 36:23.378
Your resignation
is not accepted.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.017
Now, if you'll excuse me,

36:27.018 --> 36:29.518
I'd like to go
and find my husband.

36:33.724 --> 36:35.959
Did the forensics check out?

36:35.960 --> 36:37.160
Yes.

36:37.161 --> 36:40.130
The official cause of death
was suicide.

36:41.365 --> 36:43.466
Do you accept that?

36:43.467 --> 36:45.869
At this point,
I have no reason not to.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.971
I assume this means
we no longer have reason

36:47.972 --> 36:50.472
to hold Sloane.

36:51.542 --> 36:54.042
Not necessarily.

38:14.125 --> 38:17.788
You are here because we believed
you hacked into this office

38:17.862 --> 38:20.660
and removed classified files.

38:20.731 --> 38:22.766
We were wrong.

38:22.767 --> 38:25.736
And those charges
are being dropped.

38:28.406 --> 38:30.440
So, am I to understand

38:30.441 --> 38:33.740
that you have apprehended
the mole?

38:33.811 --> 38:35.879
Yes.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.380
Senator George Reed.

38:39.583 --> 38:42.848
George Reed admitted
to working for The Covenant?

38:42.920 --> 38:45.255
He did.

38:45.256 --> 38:47.850
And then he killed himself.

38:50.928 --> 38:53.428
I wish to be released
immediately,

38:53.497 --> 38:55.865
with apologies,

38:55.866 --> 38:58.134
and my pardon agreement intact.

38:58.135 --> 39:00.635
I'm sure you would.

39:01.772 --> 39:04.332
But in going through
the senator's personal effects,

39:04.408 --> 39:07.138
we discovered evidence that,
for the past year,

39:07.211 --> 39:10.840
he has been consulting with you
regarding Rambaldi's work.

39:10.915 --> 39:13.415
And, further,
that in direct violation

39:13.484 --> 39:14.784
of your pardon agreement,

39:14.785 --> 39:16.886
you handed over certain
Rambaldi artifacts

39:16.887 --> 39:18.688
not to the DSR,

39:18.689 --> 39:21.317
but directly
to the senator himself.

39:21.392 --> 39:24.088
As a result,
we have been given authority

39:24.161 --> 39:27.426
to officially revoke
your pardon agreement.

39:28.132 --> 39:30.657
Meaning the sentence
you received

39:30.735 --> 39:35.069
prior to the agreement
is being reinstituted.

39:35.573 --> 39:38.073
In two weeks...

39:38.509 --> 39:41.410
...you'll be executed
by lethal injection.

40:02.433 --> 40:04.134
- Hello?
- Hi.

40:04.135 --> 40:05.802
Hi.

40:05.803 --> 40:08.636
I'm sorry about how
I got pulled away earlier.

40:09.373 --> 40:10.940
How is she?

40:10.941 --> 40:14.536
It's hard, dealing with
her father's death and betrayal.

40:19.016 --> 40:21.516
Are you at Eric's?

40:22.319 --> 40:24.819
No.

40:27.691 --> 40:30.191
I see.

40:34.165 --> 40:39.262
Well, I guess we won't be
getting that cup of coffee.

40:40.704 --> 40:43.204
No, we're not.

40:44.575 --> 40:46.576
Okay, I'm going to go.

40:46.577 --> 40:49.077
Syd...
