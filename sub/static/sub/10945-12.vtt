00:02.239 --> 00:04.754
Zeus! Whoa!

00:07.811 --> 00:10.246
Everybody knows
he's not your real dad.

00:12.984 --> 00:15.285
I'm sorry I punched you.

00:15.319 --> 00:18.588
Can't we just consolidate
and move forward from here?

00:18.622 --> 00:20.490
You're giving me your bracelet?

00:20.524 --> 00:23.460
Keep it for me
'til I get back.

00:23.494 --> 00:25.327
So I should tell her that
I threw away her to-do list

00:25.362 --> 00:27.853
because I couldn't possibly do
everything that she does?

00:28.343 --> 00:29.277
Yeah.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.900
Hey, boy.

01:39.968 --> 01:41.368
What happened to you?

01:43.104 --> 01:45.472
Whoa, hey.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.876
Good boy, good boy.

01:52.180 --> 01:55.415
Seriously, Amy, it's great that
you're going riding again.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.384
It's almost like the accident
never happened!

01:57.452 --> 01:59.686
Today's the day,
I'm feeling really good.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.721
So now that
you're all better...

02:01.755 --> 02:03.690
And everything,

02:03.724 --> 02:06.325
when do you think Ty's gonna
move out of the attic?

02:06.393 --> 02:07.159
You're not asking
'cause you want the attic space

02:07.194 --> 02:08.394
for yourself, right?

02:08.428 --> 02:10.162
Because Ty and I discussed it,

02:10.197 --> 02:13.099
and we think that maybe
he should just stay.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.701
Are you kidding me?!

02:14.768 --> 02:16.335
Katie has been crying
all night long,

02:16.403 --> 02:19.805
ever since Lou left for her book
tour, and I can't get any sleep!

02:19.872 --> 02:21.807
Georgie, I'm kidding you.

02:21.874 --> 02:23.275
Okay?

02:23.343 --> 02:24.343
Look.

02:27.147 --> 02:27.913
Why don't you go help him
pack up?

02:27.981 --> 02:29.315
Yeah, sure.

02:30.717 --> 02:31.650
Okay, boy.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.655
Let's do this.

02:53.805 --> 02:55.306
Amy, what's wrong?

02:57.343 --> 02:58.876
You know, on second thought,

02:58.910 --> 03:01.112
how about you ride spartan,
and I'll go help Ty.

03:01.147 --> 03:02.447
<i>But I thought you were-</i>

03:02.481 --> 03:04.282
Georgie, I just don't feel
up to it, okay?

03:04.316 --> 03:06.284
It's fine, no big deal.

03:06.318 --> 03:08.453
Ty's not supposed to leave
until you're better!

03:08.487 --> 03:10.407
Georgie, are you going
to ride him, or not?!

03:10.455 --> 03:11.889
Yeah, sure.

03:11.923 --> 03:13.290
Come on, let's go.

03:17.428 --> 03:19.329
Hey, are you moving out?

03:19.364 --> 03:21.532
Hey, yeah.

03:21.566 --> 03:23.934
But you're not making it
any easier for me.

03:25.503 --> 03:27.404
Are you feeling better?

03:27.438 --> 03:28.672
'Cause I can stick around
if you aren't.

03:28.706 --> 03:30.507
That was the deal. No!

03:30.542 --> 03:33.577
I'm fine. You have exams, and
Scott needs you at the clinic.

03:33.611 --> 03:36.079
So you best get going.

03:36.147 --> 03:39.149
Although I am going
to miss this.

03:39.184 --> 03:41.818
It's been nice having you
under the same roof.

03:41.852 --> 03:43.352
I can't wait for the day
when all this leaving stops.

03:43.387 --> 03:44.387
Me too! Yeah.

03:46.857 --> 03:48.324
Oh, I love this space!

03:50.094 --> 03:52.028
Look at this window!

03:52.096 --> 03:54.164
Oh, you can see for Miles
up here!

03:54.198 --> 03:56.432
Excuse me? Georgie?

03:56.466 --> 03:57.600
What happened
to riding spartan?

03:57.634 --> 03:59.168
I'm going to,

03:59.236 --> 04:01.404
I just wanted to come
up here and...

04:01.471 --> 04:03.439
Say goodbye to me

04:03.507 --> 04:04.607
because you're going
to miss me so much?

04:04.675 --> 04:06.242
Yeah, something like that.

04:09.246 --> 04:10.946
<i>Hey, Scott, what's up?</i>

04:10.980 --> 04:12.315
Yeah.

04:14.318 --> 04:15.951
Uh, sure. Yeah,
I can be there right now.

04:16.019 --> 04:17.853
Okay, I'm on my way.

04:17.887 --> 04:20.089
What did Scott say?

04:20.123 --> 04:22.357
He got a call about an abandoned
animal over at the ardett? Ranch,

04:22.425 --> 04:23.859
so I'll be back later.

04:27.463 --> 04:32.367
Hey, Georgie, can you do me a
favour and not say anything to Ty?

04:32.401 --> 04:34.636
You're not really
all better, are you?

04:34.704 --> 04:38.306
I'm getting there, but he needs
to move on with his life.

04:38.374 --> 04:40.709
Get back on track.

04:40.776 --> 04:41.643
Okay.

04:44.547 --> 04:46.047
Oh, look at these!

04:46.115 --> 04:47.148
Are they yours?

04:47.216 --> 04:49.683
Yes, they were!

04:49.752 --> 04:51.018
Wow! I didn't even know
they were up here.

04:51.053 --> 04:52.820
Oh, can I have them?

04:52.888 --> 04:55.056
What for?!
They're not gonna fit you!

04:55.124 --> 04:58.025
I know, but they'd look cool
on my desk.

04:58.060 --> 04:59.393
'Cause like, they're vintage!

04:59.427 --> 05:01.195
Oh, come on, I'm not that old!

05:24.185 --> 05:26.419
Whoa.

05:26.453 --> 05:27.487
What do we have here?

05:27.521 --> 05:29.756
A young gelding.

05:29.824 --> 05:32.192
Looks like a Tennessee
walking horse.

05:32.260 --> 05:35.061
Wow! Not good.

05:35.096 --> 05:36.930
Yeah, I got a call
from the farmer next door.

05:36.964 --> 05:38.464
He said he saw headlights,

05:38.499 --> 05:41.367
and heard a lot of horses
in the middle of the night.

05:41.402 --> 05:43.135
Like someone was leaving
in a big hurry.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.905
So he came by in the morning
and found him.

05:45.939 --> 05:47.774
<i>Take a look at that.</i>

05:47.808 --> 05:49.409
<i>Are these burns
on his pasterns?</i>

05:49.443 --> 05:52.745
Yeah, we'll need to
get a better look at that,

05:52.780 --> 05:55.681
but I need you to look
at this small incision here.

05:59.853 --> 06:03.055
Someone cut the microchip out.

06:03.089 --> 06:06.258
So now there's no way to trace
where the horse was registered.

06:06.293 --> 06:07.626
<i>I'd like to get him</i>
<i>into the clinic.</i>

06:07.660 --> 06:10.329
Yeah.

06:10.363 --> 06:12.897
But I think this guy needs
more than medical attention.

06:12.932 --> 06:15.300
Why don't we bring him
to heartland, Scott?

06:15.335 --> 06:18.603
I can do the exam there,
and then Amy can work with him.

06:18.638 --> 06:22.808
That's a long road back.
Is Amy up to it?

06:25.645 --> 06:28.847
Look at the condition
he's in, poor guy.

06:28.881 --> 06:32.083
No one's gonna hurt you
anymore, okay?

06:32.117 --> 06:34.552
Yeah, he's one lucky horse.

06:34.586 --> 06:37.388
Yeah, you sure did
luck out, didn't you?

06:37.456 --> 06:38.622
Maybe that's what
we'll call you.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.358
<i>"Lucked out."</i>

06:40.425 --> 06:42.760
You like that?

06:42.794 --> 06:44.695
<i>Scott says he's a
Tennessee walking horse.</i>

06:44.730 --> 06:46.163
Yeah, I think so.

06:48.066 --> 06:51.235
And... it looks like
he's been sored.

06:51.302 --> 06:53.904
<i>What is that?</i>

06:53.972 --> 06:56.372
It's one of the cruelest things
you could ever do to a horse.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.661
♪ And at the break of day

07:18.696 --> 07:23.366
♪ you sank into the dream

07:23.401 --> 07:25.134
♪ you dreamer

07:25.202 --> 07:27.370

07:42.419 --> 07:44.387
You see these burns?
That's soring.

07:44.454 --> 07:46.455
They take acid, gasoline -

07:46.523 --> 07:47.856
all kinds
of just horrible stuff -

07:47.925 --> 07:49.525
and put it on
the poor horse's legs!

07:49.592 --> 07:51.427
They're in constant pain!

07:51.494 --> 07:52.861
Why would anyone do that?

07:52.929 --> 07:54.797
Well...

07:54.831 --> 07:57.032
It makes them walk
in this really weird way.

07:57.099 --> 07:59.000
You know, they jerk their
front hooves up really high,

07:59.068 --> 08:00.869
sorta like they're dancing.

08:00.937 --> 08:04.372
It's this thing they do down
South called "the big lick."

08:04.407 --> 08:06.808
"The big lick?"

08:06.842 --> 08:08.410
<i>There's a competition
called "celebration,"</i>

08:08.477 --> 08:09.477
and if you can get your horse
to walk like this,

08:09.545 --> 08:10.878
there's a lot of money in it.

08:10.947 --> 08:14.115
<i>That is weird... and unnatural.</i>

08:14.183 --> 08:16.717
I know, I can't
even watch it!

08:16.752 --> 08:19.087
You know, every step those
horses take they're in agony.

08:21.424 --> 08:23.558
<i>Sam handler was indicted,
in a Tennessee court today,</i>

08:23.592 --> 08:25.726
<i>on multiple charges</i>
<i>of equine cruelty</i>

08:25.761 --> 08:27.428
<i>and banned from owning horses-</i>

08:27.463 --> 08:28.362
It's hard to believe something
this inhumane is even legal.

08:28.430 --> 08:30.197
It's not!

08:30.231 --> 08:32.767
The competition is legal,
but soring isn't.

08:32.835 --> 08:34.001
There's a ton of people
on both sides of the border

08:34.068 --> 08:36.437
who are totally against it,
but...

08:36.472 --> 08:37.705
There's always gonna be
someone out there

08:37.773 --> 08:39.806
who's willing to do anything
for money.

08:39.841 --> 08:41.308
<i>Mr. handler
will be ordered to return</i>

08:41.342 --> 08:44.244
<i>all of his prize winnings</i>
<i>over the last several years,</i>

08:44.279 --> 08:46.113
<i>an amount totaling close</i>
<i>to one million dollars.</i>

08:46.147 --> 08:46.880
They don't do that
up here, do they?

08:46.914 --> 08:48.382
No way.

08:48.416 --> 08:54.288
But lucked out was definitely sored,
so we have to figure out why.

08:54.322 --> 08:56.623
Tim sure picked a good time
to head off to moose jaw,

08:56.657 --> 08:59.192
leaving me high and dry to round
up all those lambs by myself!

09:00.761 --> 09:03.563
Lambs? We have lambs?

09:03.598 --> 09:06.566
Well, more than I care
to count.

09:06.601 --> 09:08.502
Well, I've got a few hours on the
weekend, Jack, if you need a hand.

09:08.536 --> 09:09.669
Can I have one?

09:09.704 --> 09:11.371
What for?

09:11.405 --> 09:13.739
The 4h club school program!

09:13.773 --> 09:14.407
I was in 4h
when I was your age.

09:14.441 --> 09:15.875
I loved it!

09:15.909 --> 09:18.144
Oh, yeah, yeah!
So was I, actually.

09:18.178 --> 09:21.847
I had a goat named "snowy"

09:21.882 --> 09:24.484
and I raised it from a kid
all the way to an adult.

09:24.518 --> 09:27.720
I did! We had a very special
bond, thank you very much,

09:27.754 --> 09:29.394
until I had to sell it
to auction, though.

09:29.422 --> 09:31.189
You know what I like
about goats?

09:31.224 --> 09:32.290
What's that?

09:32.325 --> 09:34.126
Nothin'.

09:35.862 --> 09:37.542
They're actually
very affectionate animals.

09:37.564 --> 09:40.332
Okay, well, let's try
to stay on track here!

09:40.366 --> 09:43.502
Please, please, please.
Please, can I have a lamb?

09:43.537 --> 09:44.770
Fine with me. Peter?

09:46.739 --> 09:48.540
Uh...

09:48.574 --> 09:50.042
Okay, yes, you can,

09:50.109 --> 09:53.178
but you understand Georgie
that you can't keep it, right?

09:53.212 --> 09:54.413
I know how attached you get to
new animals when the get here.

09:54.447 --> 09:55.547
I can handle it.

09:55.581 --> 09:57.349
It's not like
I'm some little kid!

09:57.383 --> 09:59.251
<i>Oh, speaking of new animals,</i>

09:59.285 --> 10:00.952
I see there's a new one
in the barn.

10:00.986 --> 10:02.787
Yeah.

10:02.821 --> 10:04.288
Well, are you sure
you should be taking on

10:04.356 --> 10:06.223
another rescue horse right now?

10:06.258 --> 10:07.025
I'm a hundred percent, grandpa.

10:07.092 --> 10:08.426
I'm fine.

10:10.596 --> 10:11.629
Ty, tell him.

10:13.732 --> 10:16.868
She's doing much better.
She really is.

10:16.936 --> 10:19.470
Okay, just don't push it.

10:19.504 --> 10:20.504
I won't.

10:23.508 --> 10:25.076
I'm not making a mistake, am I?

10:25.143 --> 10:25.809
Are you sure you're okay?

10:25.877 --> 10:26.977
Absolutely.

10:28.746 --> 10:30.247
No dizziness? More headaches?

10:30.315 --> 10:31.815
No, Ty!

10:31.849 --> 10:36.019
Dr. verani, checked me out last
week, and she said I was good.

10:36.087 --> 10:37.788
What about nightmares?
Or visions?

10:37.855 --> 10:39.957
Ty, stop it, I'm fine!

10:40.024 --> 10:40.924
Okay, Amy, I just wanna
make sure you're okay.

10:40.992 --> 10:42.893
I know, I know.

10:42.961 --> 10:44.828
And I appreciate it.

10:44.896 --> 10:46.737
You know, you're the reason
I got through this.

10:46.764 --> 10:47.931
So thank you.

10:55.372 --> 10:57.073
If you need anything at all, I'm
just a short drive down the road.

10:57.108 --> 10:58.808
I know.

10:58.842 --> 10:59.809
- Okay.
- I love you.

10:59.843 --> 11:00.943
I love you too.

11:21.364 --> 11:23.532
Yeah, nobody panic!
Daddy's here!

11:23.600 --> 11:24.966
- Jeez!
- Peter!

11:25.034 --> 11:26.067
Okay! What's happening?
Yes, are you okay?

11:26.102 --> 11:28.103
What's going on?

11:28.114 --> 11:30.781
Katie's crying
and I can't get her to stop!

11:33.510 --> 11:35.144
You almost gave me
a heart attack!

11:35.178 --> 11:38.747
You almost gave me
a heart attack!

11:38.814 --> 11:40.949
Do you always wake up
all weird like that?

11:40.983 --> 11:44.753
I don't know, I'm not usually
scrutinized in my sleep like that!

11:44.787 --> 11:46.487
Peter, now that Ty's moved out
of the attic and everything,

11:46.522 --> 11:47.956
do you think that I mi-

11:53.462 --> 11:56.297
Well, it looks like high hat
has an abscessed canine tooth.

11:56.331 --> 11:58.299
We'll drain it
and give him some antibiotics.

11:58.333 --> 12:00.368
Hopefully we won't have
to pull it.

12:00.402 --> 12:02.170
Aw, poor guy.

12:02.204 --> 12:05.573
I mean that's got
to be painful.

12:05.607 --> 12:07.141
Mr. Drake, I just need to get
some information from you.

12:07.176 --> 12:08.942
Hey, sure.
What kind of information?

12:08.977 --> 12:13.047
High hat's
age, his previous medical history.

12:13.081 --> 12:14.347
Have we met before?
You look really familiar.

12:14.382 --> 12:15.783
No, I-I don't think so.

12:17.952 --> 12:20.020
Anyway, I'm afraid
I can't be much help there,

12:20.055 --> 12:22.189
I picked him up at a farm auction
in consort a few weeks ago.

12:22.223 --> 12:23.857
Oh.

12:23.892 --> 12:24.925
Did anyone tell you
what breed he is?

12:24.993 --> 12:27.360
You know, I don't even
think I asked.

12:27.395 --> 12:30.263
I mean, I'm not much
of a horse person myself,

12:30.298 --> 12:32.499
but he looked pretty good
to me.

12:32.533 --> 12:33.833
<i>You did well, Mr. Drake.</i>

12:33.901 --> 12:35.902
You have a fine looking
young Tennessee walking horse.

12:35.936 --> 12:38.271
Oh, you don't say!

12:38.306 --> 12:40.773
Well, I'll have to do
some reading on that.

12:40.808 --> 12:42.175
Now, what time do you think
you'll be done?

12:42.210 --> 12:44.777
Ah, should be a couple hours
or so.

12:44.812 --> 12:46.346
Well, thank you, Dr. cardinal.

12:46.380 --> 12:47.646
I'll be by to pick him up.

12:52.485 --> 12:54.587
Two Tennessee walking horses
in two days.

12:54.654 --> 12:57.656
One of them sored
and abandoned...

12:57.691 --> 12:59.592
Yeah, it is a coincidence,
isn't it?

13:01.729 --> 13:04.162
<i>Just let me check</i>
<i>something out.</i>

13:07.534 --> 13:09.000
Well, that's interesting.

13:09.068 --> 13:10.969
What is it?

13:11.003 --> 13:14.840
Well, any identification number
that starts with "900"

13:14.874 --> 13:17.909
means the horse was registered
in the U.S.

13:19.379 --> 13:20.478
Huh...

13:20.546 --> 13:22.347
Come on, boy.

13:22.414 --> 13:23.782
That's it, nice and slow.

13:25.885 --> 13:28.720
It must feel good
to have some fresh air, huh?

13:28.788 --> 13:30.588
<i>You're a good boy.</i>

13:30.656 --> 13:32.124
<i>All right, I know.</i>

13:34.026 --> 13:35.827
That's enough for today, huh?

13:37.496 --> 13:38.896
I know exactly how you feel.

13:40.633 --> 13:43.434
You just need some more time.

13:48.940 --> 13:50.808
Hey, kiddo. Hey, what's up?

13:50.876 --> 13:52.877
You won't believe
what happened at school today!

13:52.944 --> 13:54.245
You know the 4h club?

13:54.312 --> 13:55.679
- Yeah.
- Well, guess what?

13:55.713 --> 13:58.015
I got paired up
with Olivia wheaton!

13:58.083 --> 13:59.817
My absolute Nemesis!

13:59.885 --> 14:02.920
And now she's coming here
in one hour!

14:02.988 --> 14:05.089
Oh boy.

14:05.157 --> 14:08.292
I can't believe our teacher
just paired us up like that!

14:08.359 --> 14:11.328
I am so mad,
I just feel like quitting!

14:11.396 --> 14:13.897
Well, I'm sure your teacher
had her reasons.

14:13.931 --> 14:15.399
And maybe it's time for you
two to bury the hatchet.

14:15.433 --> 14:16.667
Bury the hatchet?!

14:16.734 --> 14:18.769
Yeah, get over yourselves.

14:18.803 --> 14:19.969
Do you really wanna quit
without even trying, honey?

14:20.037 --> 14:21.772
Maybe it'll work out!

14:21.839 --> 14:24.541
But Olivia is the last person
I wanna work with!

14:24.609 --> 14:26.142
Well, that's life, kiddo.

14:26.177 --> 14:28.577
Sometimes you don't get
to choose, okay?

14:28.645 --> 14:31.781
Thanks for being
so sympathetic.

14:31.816 --> 14:33.449
Honey, you're the one
who's always saying

14:33.517 --> 14:34.884
you're not a little kid
anymore, right?

14:34.919 --> 14:35.885
So stop acting like one!

14:35.953 --> 14:38.621
You can handle Olivia.

14:38.689 --> 14:41.024
I've seen you do it.

14:41.058 --> 14:42.491
Okay, I get your point.

14:44.594 --> 14:47.763
Without punching her
in the face, though.

14:47.798 --> 14:48.631
If you say so.

14:53.570 --> 14:54.537
<i>Hey, Scott?</i>

14:54.571 --> 14:55.738
Come check this out.

14:57.874 --> 15:00.408
High hat was registered
in shelbyville, Tennessee,

15:00.443 --> 15:02.010
and it's also giving me
the name of his sire and dam.

15:02.045 --> 15:04.412
<i>Caliban and hyacinth.</i>

15:04.447 --> 15:07.749
Well then, the seller up in consort
should've had papers on him.

15:07.783 --> 15:09.251
Otherwise, how did they get
the horse across the border?

15:09.285 --> 15:10.953
<i>Yeah!</i>

15:10.987 --> 15:13.521
Like an import permit,
or a health certificate.

15:13.556 --> 15:15.623
Breed information,
or even medical history.

15:15.658 --> 15:18.025
You bet.

15:18.093 --> 15:20.528
So how come eldon Drake doesn't
know anything about his own horse?

15:20.563 --> 15:22.364
Good question.

15:22.398 --> 15:24.466
But with or without papers,

15:24.500 --> 15:27.141
there's no way you could pick up a
purebred like that for so cheap!

15:45.921 --> 15:47.255
Hey.

15:47.322 --> 15:48.389
Hey.

16:07.141 --> 16:08.821
How come your bedroom
looks like a nursery?

16:08.842 --> 16:09.876
Because it is a nursery.

16:09.944 --> 16:11.611
I share with my little sister.

16:11.678 --> 16:16.049
How do you ever expect to have
sleepovers if you sleep in a nursery?

16:16.117 --> 16:17.650
Well, not that
it's any of your business,

16:17.684 --> 16:19.652
but maybe I don't want
to have sleepovers.

16:19.720 --> 16:23.656
Fine, be unpopular
for the rest of your life.

16:23.724 --> 16:24.957
Oh, look. A charm bracelet.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.126
How retro.

16:27.193 --> 16:29.629
Don't touch my stuff!

16:29.696 --> 16:32.698
Okay! So snarky, jeez.

16:32.733 --> 16:33.633
You know what? We're done here.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.535
Get out of my room! Out!

16:35.602 --> 16:37.102
Nice manners, too.

16:40.407 --> 16:42.908
How 'bout this one?

16:42.976 --> 16:44.676
Aww! He's so cute!

16:44.744 --> 16:45.710
Look at the little ears!

16:45.778 --> 16:47.947
And his nose!

16:48.014 --> 16:49.748
<i>Adorable!</i>

16:49.816 --> 16:51.116
Actually, hold on a sec.

16:51.184 --> 16:53.685
His eyes are crooked.

16:53.753 --> 16:55.587
<i>Oh... yeah.</i>

16:55.655 --> 16:57.221
She's right.

16:59.058 --> 17:00.859
They look okay to me!

17:00.927 --> 17:02.828
Well, Jack, it's a competition.

17:02.895 --> 17:05.696
We have to have the perfect
lamb if we want to win.

17:05.765 --> 17:07.566
<i>How about...</i>

17:07.599 --> 17:08.401
That one over there?

17:12.804 --> 17:13.804
<i>Which one?!</i>

17:13.872 --> 17:15.073
<i>That one!</i>

17:16.175 --> 17:17.675
Oh! Ah!

17:19.278 --> 17:21.512
Pick something else!

17:21.579 --> 17:22.981
That one, over there.

17:23.048 --> 17:24.682
No, no, that one, over there!

17:24.749 --> 17:26.084
Oof!

17:26.151 --> 17:27.318
<i>No!</i>

17:29.020 --> 17:30.253
<i>We need that
one, over there!</i>

17:30.321 --> 17:32.623
<i>- No, we don't!</i>
<i>- Yes, we do!</i>

17:32.657 --> 17:34.024
Amy, you're not going
to believe this.

17:34.092 --> 17:35.759
What?

17:35.827 --> 17:37.828
I came across this online
footage of caliban

17:37.863 --> 17:39.196
<i>in a Tennessee walking</i>
<i>horse competition,</i>

17:39.263 --> 17:40.430
<i>that's him, right there.</i>

17:40.499 --> 17:41.699
That's high hat's sire?

17:41.733 --> 17:43.266
The horse with
the infected tooth?

17:43.301 --> 17:47.070
Yeah, and there was a link to
another video we saw earlier.

17:48.439 --> 17:49.639
The Sam handler video.

17:49.673 --> 17:52.209
That's right.

17:52.276 --> 17:54.196
<i>On multiple
charges of equine cruelty.</i>

17:54.795 --> 17:56.363
Now, watch this:

17:57.115 --> 17:58.248
<i>That's him, right there!</i>

17:58.282 --> 18:00.017
Who?

18:00.051 --> 18:01.183
Eldon Drake, the guy
who brought high hat over

18:01.218 --> 18:03.352
to the stable this morning!

18:03.387 --> 18:05.421
<i>I knew I'd seen him</i>
<i>somewhere before!</i>

18:05.455 --> 18:06.856
Okay, but why would your
client be involved with someone

18:06.891 --> 18:08.057
who's soring horses?

18:09.693 --> 18:11.060
<i>Good question.</i>

18:13.063 --> 18:14.731
Oops! Okay...

18:14.765 --> 18:15.765
Uh, no, Nicole, you know what?

18:15.799 --> 18:17.599
<i>Dada!</i>

18:17.634 --> 18:19.235
I can't make it
into the diner right now!

18:19.236 --> 18:22.671
This last minute, I can't-be-

18:22.705 --> 18:25.141
I'm sorry, the deep fryer
burst into flames?!

18:25.175 --> 18:28.010
Okay, um... Any casualties?

18:28.045 --> 18:29.178
Well, that's good.

18:29.212 --> 18:32.014
No, look, I don't, uh-

18:32.049 --> 18:33.115
can you just look on
the Internet yourself maybe

18:33.150 --> 18:34.449
and try to find a repairman?

18:34.483 --> 18:35.817
That'd be great, thanks.

18:35.852 --> 18:38.020
Bye.

18:38.054 --> 18:40.656
I got a postcard from mallory.

18:40.690 --> 18:45.360
Says she's in London visiting
soraya and having a great time.

18:45.394 --> 18:46.962
Oh, that's great,
I'll let Lou know.

18:46.996 --> 18:48.396
She'll be very pleased
to hear that.

18:48.397 --> 18:50.365
You know, I don't know how you
get any work done in here.

18:50.433 --> 18:51.366
You need more space.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.368
Yeah... really?

18:53.402 --> 18:54.936
The thought never
occurred to me.

18:54.970 --> 18:57.330
Why don't you move out to
the office in the barn, then?

18:57.339 --> 18:59.107
Uh, I...

18:59.141 --> 19:00.808
I'd just be too far away
from Katie there,

19:00.842 --> 19:02.444
you know, I can't single parent
from the barn, so.

19:02.478 --> 19:04.579
Oh.

19:04.646 --> 19:07.281
Well, you know,
there's a desk in the attic.

19:07.348 --> 19:09.349
Ty's gone, why don't you
spread out up there?

19:09.384 --> 19:11.218
It's okay,
honey, it's okay!

19:16.558 --> 19:21.228
Okay, so it said at the
corner of 288 west and 330.

19:21.296 --> 19:23.730
There it is.
Slow down, slow down!

19:23.798 --> 19:25.765
So it should be somewhere
right around here.

19:34.775 --> 19:38.412
Are you sure that was the address
on eldon Drake's intake form?

19:38.446 --> 19:40.080
Yeah.

19:40.147 --> 19:42.248
Obviously, it's a fake.

19:42.316 --> 19:44.584
Okay, so what now?

19:44.652 --> 19:46.653
'Cause we obviously can't save
a horse we can't find!

19:46.721 --> 19:48.287
Dammit!

19:48.322 --> 19:49.522
I should've known
this would happen.

19:49.590 --> 19:51.024
Wait, Ty.

19:51.092 --> 19:52.225
Do you have a phone number
for him?

19:52.292 --> 19:53.727
Yeah, and I know it's real,

19:53.794 --> 19:56.162
because I had to call eldon to let
him know that high hat was ready.

19:56.230 --> 19:57.963
Okay, I think I have an idea.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.732
Ty, what if I was to call him,

19:59.799 --> 20:03.202
and pretend I was looking to
buy a Tennessee walking horse?

20:03.270 --> 20:04.703
I don't know, Amy.

20:04.738 --> 20:05.971
If it gets me into the stable,

20:06.039 --> 20:08.774
I can at least see firsthand
what's going on!

20:08.842 --> 20:11.910
It was a total fluke that you
guys found that horse alive.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.943
We can't let another horse
end up that way!

20:21.303 --> 20:24.972
<i>Uh, "Once the lamb
is weaned, mix the drench..."</i>

20:25.040 --> 20:28.042
With equal parts water, and apply
to the back of the tongue."

20:28.076 --> 20:30.378
What's it for?

20:30.446 --> 20:32.847
"Proper usage will inhibit..."

20:32.881 --> 20:36.784
Infestations of parasites
such as blow fly larvae,

20:36.819 --> 20:38.685
"tape worms and lung worms."

20:38.753 --> 20:41.421
Ew! Gross.

20:41.489 --> 20:43.457
Our Beyonce couldn't
possibly have worms!

20:43.491 --> 20:45.659
"Beyonce?!"

20:45.693 --> 20:47.728
When did we decide
to call her that?

20:47.762 --> 20:51.631
I don't know, I just thought
it was kind of a cool name.

20:51.666 --> 20:54.100
You do not call
a lamb "Beyonce!"

20:54.134 --> 20:56.370
The kids in 4h are going
to think we're total dorks!

20:56.404 --> 20:59.339
News flash,
4h club is for dorks.

20:59.374 --> 21:00.674
In case you haven't noticed.

21:00.708 --> 21:03.543
Really?!
Then, why are you here?

21:03.611 --> 21:05.945
Because my mom is a complete
4h club fanatic, okay?

21:05.980 --> 21:08.849
She made me, I hate her.

21:08.883 --> 21:10.716
Whatever, but we're not
calling the lamb "Beyonce."

21:10.751 --> 21:13.219
Okay, what would you call it?

21:13.254 --> 21:14.720
Well, something normal.

21:16.056 --> 21:18.124
Like...

21:18.158 --> 21:19.592
Clover.

21:23.898 --> 21:24.931
Looking good.

21:24.965 --> 21:26.165
The infection's clearing up.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.700
<i>How's his appetite?</i>

21:27.734 --> 21:29.702
Better.

21:29.736 --> 21:31.970
We'll get there eventually,
won't we, hmm?

21:32.005 --> 21:33.205
Yeah.

21:34.474 --> 21:35.941
I don't recognize this number.

21:35.975 --> 21:37.943
Hello?

21:37.977 --> 21:39.545
Mr. Drake. Yes, this is Amy.

21:41.114 --> 21:42.848
Okay, great!

21:42.883 --> 21:44.983
Yeah, when can I come
to your stable?

21:45.018 --> 21:46.651
Oh, okay.

21:46.719 --> 21:48.453
Sure.

21:48.487 --> 21:49.754
Yeah, I'll see you then.

21:49.789 --> 21:52.424
Bye.

21:52.458 --> 21:55.160
He's meeting me with his horse
at the Hudson rodeo grounds.

21:55.194 --> 21:56.061
Well, that doesn't
help much, does it?

21:56.095 --> 21:57.629
I still have to go!

21:57.663 --> 21:58.964
No Amy, you don't. Not alone.

21:58.998 --> 22:00.197
I'm coming with you.

22:00.232 --> 22:02.166
You can't,
he already knows you!

22:02.200 --> 22:04.302
Well, what do you expect
to accomplish with this?

22:04.369 --> 22:05.369
<i>We need to get to his stable,</i>
<i>right?</i>

22:05.404 --> 22:07.271
That's what I was hoping for,

22:07.339 --> 22:09.874
but I just really wanna find out
if he's up to something.

22:09.909 --> 22:11.810
No way, Amy.
You're not doing this alone.

22:11.844 --> 22:15.246
Ty, all I'm doing is meeting
a guy about his horse, okay?

22:15.280 --> 22:17.048
You don't have to be
so overprotective!

22:17.082 --> 22:20.217
Although, but I have to say
it's kind of...

22:20.252 --> 22:21.385
Adorable.

22:21.420 --> 22:22.954
Really?!

22:22.988 --> 22:23.887
Adorable?

22:23.922 --> 22:24.922
Mm-hmm.

22:34.999 --> 22:35.966
Fantastic.

22:53.985 --> 22:55.518
Mr. Drake?

22:55.586 --> 22:58.221
Oh!

22:58.289 --> 22:59.789
Hi, I'm Amy.

22:59.823 --> 23:00.423
Pleased to meet you, Amy.

23:00.491 --> 23:01.524
You too.

23:01.558 --> 23:02.993
So? Yeah.

23:03.027 --> 23:05.462
You're looking for
a Tennessee Walker?

23:05.496 --> 23:09.331
Well, this here is high hat, and
you won't find too many horses

23:09.399 --> 23:10.900
around here with his pedigree.

23:10.968 --> 23:12.969
Well, he's a beauty.

23:13.036 --> 23:17.907
Yeah, I'd be willing to pay top
dollar for him, if he checks out.

23:17.975 --> 23:19.008
I can tell he's in good shape.

23:19.042 --> 23:20.810
Thank you.

23:20.878 --> 23:22.644
How much do you know about
Tennessee walking horses?

23:22.678 --> 23:25.680
Well, I've been riding for
as long as I can remember,

23:25.748 --> 23:27.582
but I've never really
placed first.

23:27.617 --> 23:29.551
So I thought
with a horse like this...

23:29.585 --> 23:31.120
Well, what were you...

23:31.187 --> 23:32.787
Planning on riding him in?

23:32.822 --> 23:36.425
Well, there's this competition
in shelbyville, Tennessee.

23:36.459 --> 23:39.027
The only problem
is if I were to buy him,

23:39.094 --> 23:40.695
I'd have to ship him
all the way down there,

23:40.730 --> 23:43.398
and it's awfully late
in the season to find a trainer.

23:43.432 --> 23:45.433
You want him trained?

23:45.501 --> 23:48.637
Yeah, definitely, yeah,
if I'm gonna compete in August.

23:48.704 --> 23:50.705
Well... I'll think about it,

23:50.740 --> 23:52.473
and I'll be in touch.

23:56.178 --> 23:58.312
You know, why don't you uh...

23:58.347 --> 24:00.614
Why don't you train him here?

24:00.649 --> 24:02.850
There's really no one up here

24:02.884 --> 24:05.619
that knows how to train for
what I want him to do, anyway.

24:05.654 --> 24:07.588
Well, the thing is,
I might know someone.

24:07.622 --> 24:12.560
Well see, I'm talking about
a very specific method.

24:12.594 --> 24:15.763
Listen, I know someone with
some expertise with the breed.

24:15.797 --> 24:19.934
He's been training prize winning
Tennessee walking horses for years.

24:20.001 --> 24:22.169
I can set something up,
if you want.

24:22.203 --> 24:24.237
Yeah, maybe.

24:24.272 --> 24:26.672
Well, you wanna take high hat
for a ride, get a feel for him?

24:26.675 --> 24:29.142
I'll get him tacked up
in no time.

24:30.578 --> 24:34.147
Um...

24:34.182 --> 24:36.049
No, I-I can see that
he's a beautiful horse

24:36.084 --> 24:38.285
and I'm sure he rides well.

24:38.319 --> 24:39.852
I'll be in touch.

25:01.641 --> 25:04.610
<i>This is Ty borden,
please leave a message.</i>

25:04.677 --> 25:08.046
Ty, we were right about eldon.

25:08.081 --> 25:11.249
He is definitely involved in soring
horses, I just get that feeling!

25:11.283 --> 25:13.018
I don't have any proof though,

25:13.086 --> 25:17.055
so I'm gonna stick close and follow
him, hopefully, to his stable.

25:18.625 --> 25:20.291
Okay, he's on the move.

25:20.326 --> 25:21.474
I gotta go!

25:36.383 --> 25:37.983
Would you hold still?!

25:38.051 --> 25:39.585
So...

25:39.653 --> 25:41.053
I guess they stuck you
in that icky little room

25:41.120 --> 25:42.555
'cause you're adopted.

25:42.589 --> 25:43.823
What are you talking about?

25:43.890 --> 25:45.491
The nursery.

25:45.559 --> 25:47.560
If you were really
part of the family,

25:47.627 --> 25:50.162
wouldn't you at least
get your own bedroom?

25:50.229 --> 25:52.397
Obviously,
they don't really like you.

25:52.466 --> 25:53.933
You know what?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.440
I'm just gonna ignore you
completely,

25:55.501 --> 25:58.036
because I know exactly
what you're trying to do

25:58.104 --> 25:59.804
and it's not gonna work.

25:59.872 --> 26:02.407
Did you know that,
statistically speaking,

26:02.442 --> 26:04.742
adopted children grow up
to be social misfits?

26:04.810 --> 26:06.378
Not listening!

26:06.446 --> 26:07.980
And criminals,
and mentally unstable.

26:08.047 --> 26:09.348
Would you shut up?!

26:09.415 --> 26:10.815
You're such a witch!

26:10.883 --> 26:12.283
Someone can't handle the truth.

26:12.351 --> 26:14.318
Someone is really
asking for it!

26:14.386 --> 26:15.319
No, no, you don't!

26:15.387 --> 26:16.855
<i>Not this time!</i>

26:16.922 --> 26:18.623
I have an intervention whistle!

26:23.228 --> 26:25.697
Olivia, get back here!

26:25.764 --> 26:27.598
You're gonna be sorry for this!

26:27.665 --> 26:30.434
No way! I'm going home!

27:18.081 --> 27:19.982
Ty, hey.
Did you get my message?

27:20.017 --> 27:20.750
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:20.784 --> 27:22.317
Okay.

27:22.352 --> 27:24.020
Yeah, I followed eldon
to his stable,

27:24.054 --> 27:26.989
it's on highway 107a,
past that old stone quarry.

27:27.024 --> 27:28.490
Are you still in the truck?

27:28.525 --> 27:30.593
Yeah.

27:30.627 --> 27:33.695
But, Ty, this is a lot bigger
than we thought.

27:33.729 --> 27:35.464
<i>Judging by the size</i>
<i>of his stable,</i>

27:35.498 --> 27:36.665
he could have a ton of horses
in there!

27:36.699 --> 27:39.301
<i>Okay, Amy,</i> I need you
to stay in the truck, okay?

27:39.335 --> 27:41.270
I'm serious!

27:41.304 --> 27:41.970
<i>I'm gonna be there</i>
<i>as soon as I can.</i>

27:42.038 --> 27:45.074
<i>Just don't-</i> don't do
anything, all right?

27:45.108 --> 27:46.475
Okay, but hurry!

27:50.412 --> 27:51.245
Oh no!

27:59.755 --> 28:01.756
Clover!

28:01.791 --> 28:03.792
Where are you?

28:15.804 --> 28:17.538
Hey!

28:17.573 --> 28:18.806
Am I interrupting
something important?

28:18.873 --> 28:23.010
No, I was just redrafting
this taxation initiative proposal.

28:23.078 --> 28:24.344
I must've dozed off.

28:24.378 --> 28:25.946
Yeah, I can't imagine why.

28:27.682 --> 28:28.849
Is everything okay?
Katie all right?

28:28.883 --> 28:31.051
Nope, she's fine.
I set her down for a nap.

28:31.086 --> 28:32.820
So how's the office
working out?

28:32.887 --> 28:35.455
Oh, great. Fine, yeah!
Good, thanks.

28:35.490 --> 28:36.356
I'm thinking about throwing
a filing cabinet up here,

28:36.424 --> 28:38.325
maybe a dry erase board.

28:38.392 --> 28:40.793
Yeah, I see you're all set up
for darts.

28:40.861 --> 28:41.694
<i>Yeah!</i>

28:41.762 --> 28:46.299
Well, you know, they say a good
dart game helps focus the mind.

28:47.635 --> 28:49.836
Best two out of three?

28:49.903 --> 28:52.472
You're on!

28:52.540 --> 28:54.007
<i>Jack! Peter!</i>

28:54.074 --> 28:55.942
- In the office!
- In the attic!

28:57.511 --> 28:59.245
The lamb, it's gone!

28:59.312 --> 29:00.512
Olivia and I got in a big fight

29:00.514 --> 29:01.748
<i>and she forgot</i>
<i>to close the gate!</i>

29:01.782 --> 29:03.716
Or I did, I don't remember!

29:03.751 --> 29:05.184
And then I went back...

29:08.922 --> 29:10.623
What are you doing up here?!

29:10.658 --> 29:13.592
Well, I decided to-no, never mind that.
Are you sure?

29:13.660 --> 29:14.693
Did you check the yard?

29:14.761 --> 29:16.795
Yes, I looked everywhere!

29:16.863 --> 29:18.364
What if the coyotes get her?!

29:18.431 --> 29:19.265
Not on my watch!

30:53.156 --> 30:54.923
Oh my God!

30:56.226 --> 30:57.926
<i>Oh no!</i>

31:36.798 --> 31:39.232
I got a phone call...

31:49.043 --> 31:51.577
Come on, Ty. Pick up, please!

31:51.645 --> 31:52.145
<i>This is Ty borden,
please leave a message.</i>

31:52.213 --> 31:53.613
No!

31:53.681 --> 31:55.348
Hi, it's me.

31:55.416 --> 31:57.784
I'm in the barn
and they're both here -

31:57.852 --> 31:59.953
eldon Drake and Sam handler!

32:21.568 --> 32:23.136
Now listen, you had no business
showing that horse!

32:23.203 --> 32:25.804
I keep telling you, we gotta
keep a low profile up here!

32:25.872 --> 32:27.072
It's an easy twenty grand!

32:29.243 --> 32:31.177
<i>Okay...</i>

32:31.211 --> 32:31.944
Ow!

32:46.126 --> 32:47.159
Yeah, I got overhead too,
you know.

32:47.193 --> 32:47.993
I got expenses of my own!

32:48.061 --> 32:49.361
Hey!

32:49.395 --> 32:51.829
If anyone catches wind we're
training Tennessee walkers

32:51.864 --> 32:53.398
north of the border,

32:53.466 --> 32:56.034
there's a world of pain
waiting for us stateside!

32:58.471 --> 32:59.904
Oh yeah, come on!

33:05.911 --> 33:10.014
Come on, boy!
Come on, now's your chance!

33:10.049 --> 33:11.683
Come on, we've gotta hurry!

33:11.717 --> 33:13.685
We already had to move
the damn horses once,

33:13.719 --> 33:15.280
and you, like an idiot,
left one behind!

33:15.287 --> 33:16.854
It didn't have what it takes.

33:16.889 --> 33:19.223
There was no reason
to bring it along!

33:19.257 --> 33:22.126
Which is why I told you
to shoot it and bury it!

33:22.161 --> 33:24.295
But you messed that up, too!

33:26.431 --> 33:27.798
You know what?!

33:30.302 --> 33:33.237
That doesn't sound good!

33:33.271 --> 33:34.438
Come on, we've gotta go!

33:34.472 --> 33:35.872
Come on!

33:40.845 --> 33:41.912
Go!

33:45.516 --> 33:47.017
Agh!

33:52.924 --> 33:53.990
<i>Hey!</i>

33:55.693 --> 33:57.594
<i>You! What are you doing here?!</i>

33:57.628 --> 34:00.029
<i>Get away from that horse!</i>

34:07.471 --> 34:08.904
Come on, boy! Let's go!

34:10.708 --> 34:11.208
Ah! Oof!

34:14.344 --> 34:17.746
Stop her! Run her
down, if you have to!

34:22.152 --> 34:23.685
Watch him!

34:23.754 --> 34:25.387
Back off!

34:27.690 --> 34:29.324
Hey!

34:31.561 --> 34:33.495
You ever been struck
by lightning, boy?

34:35.598 --> 34:36.498
It should give you
a real big taste!

34:36.565 --> 34:38.400
Haaah!

34:38.434 --> 34:39.900
Oof!

34:39.969 --> 34:41.370
Agh!

34:46.742 --> 34:52.480
Don't move, or so help me God, I
will ram this down your throat!

35:04.125 --> 35:06.894
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

35:06.928 --> 35:09.297
<i>Clover!</i>

35:09.364 --> 35:11.231
Where did you find her?

35:11.300 --> 35:13.267
Oh, about a mile west.

35:13.302 --> 35:14.835
<i>Ohhh!</i>

35:14.903 --> 35:16.637
Now, you listen up.

35:16.705 --> 35:18.939
She was a long ways away.

35:18.973 --> 35:21.175
You're responsible
for a small life,

35:21.209 --> 35:23.210
but you let your differences
with this girl

35:23.278 --> 35:25.212
get in the way of that
and look what happened!

35:25.280 --> 35:27.547
I did kinda mess up, huh?

35:27.581 --> 35:29.549
You bet you did!

35:29.583 --> 35:34.321
Now, I suggest you focus on what
you're supposed to be doing,

35:34.388 --> 35:37.490
so we don't have any more
lamb catastrophes.

35:38.826 --> 35:40.627
Okay.

35:40.661 --> 35:42.228
Alrighty.

35:42.296 --> 35:43.763
Let's go, clover.

36:13.860 --> 36:15.961
Shh, shh, shh, shh!
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

36:35.047 --> 36:37.482
Oh! Agh!

36:39.085 --> 36:41.252
Is it breakfast yet?

36:41.286 --> 36:44.154
No! What-
what are you doing in here?!

36:44.189 --> 36:44.955
What does it look
like I'm doing?

36:45.023 --> 36:47.124
I'm trying to sleep!

36:47.192 --> 36:48.793
<i>Katie keeps waking me up!</i>

36:48.827 --> 36:50.695
I really, really need
my own bedroom!

36:50.729 --> 36:52.229
Okay, well...

36:52.264 --> 36:53.731
There are no more rooms, honey.

36:53.766 --> 36:54.965
Yes, there is!

36:56.334 --> 36:57.401
The attic.

36:59.905 --> 37:01.005
It could count as
a bedroom, couldn't it?

37:01.039 --> 37:03.773
I mean, if I moved up there?

37:03.807 --> 37:05.808
It's perfect, don't you think?

37:05.876 --> 37:07.410
Pleeeeeease?

37:07.444 --> 37:09.779
Okay! Hey, listen!

37:09.846 --> 37:10.713
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

37:10.747 --> 37:12.681
<i>Okay? How about that?</i>

37:12.716 --> 37:13.649
We'll both just get
a good night's...

37:17.187 --> 37:19.222
Sleep.

37:23.506 --> 37:25.473
<i>Now, I'm not going</i>
<i>to lie to you,</i>

37:25.541 --> 37:28.576
this is bitter,
horrible medicine.

37:28.611 --> 37:31.445
But that's life,
so get used to it.

37:32.915 --> 37:35.049
Hey.

37:35.083 --> 37:37.718
How's it going?

37:37.786 --> 37:40.854
Well, solo lamb parenting is
a lot harder than I thought.

37:40.923 --> 37:42.723
Right.

37:42.791 --> 37:45.659
I'm sorry it didn't work out
with Olivia,

37:45.727 --> 37:48.228
but I do have something that
might cheer you up a little bit.

37:48.296 --> 37:50.030
You wanna come and see?

37:50.064 --> 37:51.398
Yeah, sure.

37:53.601 --> 37:56.169
Okay, you can open your eyes.

37:57.972 --> 38:00.607
<i>- Is this...?</i>
<i>- It's your bedroom.</i>

38:00.642 --> 38:02.576
I know it doesn't
look like much right now,

38:02.644 --> 38:03.877
but you know,
when Lou gets back, we can-

38:03.945 --> 38:06.179
oh, it's perfect, I love it!

38:06.247 --> 38:08.048
Okay! Thank you!

38:08.115 --> 38:09.075
Don't mention it.

38:11.185 --> 38:13.619
But I thought you
wanted the attic to yourself?

38:13.654 --> 38:16.089
Oh no. Gosh, no.

38:16.157 --> 38:18.291
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

38:20.627 --> 38:21.761
So...

38:23.730 --> 38:25.598
Tell me about what happened
with Olivia.

38:25.666 --> 38:26.999
Well...

38:30.303 --> 38:32.438
I hate Olivia,
and Olivia hates me.

38:32.506 --> 38:34.340
Period.

38:34.407 --> 38:36.843
And if it weren't for that
stupid intervention whistle,

38:36.910 --> 38:39.278
I probably would've punched
her lights out.

38:39.346 --> 38:40.812
Again.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.547
Intervention whistle? Okay...

38:42.615 --> 38:43.983
I'm not gonna touch that.

38:44.050 --> 38:46.585
Here's the thing:

38:46.619 --> 38:49.521
I think that you and Olivia
have a lot of similar qualities.

38:49.555 --> 38:51.090
Are you kidding me?!

38:51.157 --> 38:53.492
Now, now, hold on,
just hear me out, okay?

38:53.526 --> 38:55.259
You're both super competitive.

38:55.327 --> 38:56.728
Right?

38:56.762 --> 38:58.897
So maybe if you work together,

38:58.931 --> 39:01.531
you could bring out the best in
each other, rather than the worst.

39:03.369 --> 39:05.169
So what should I do?

39:07.172 --> 39:08.072
You should...

39:10.775 --> 39:14.812
Give her a call, pitch her on the
idea of you guys working together

39:14.846 --> 39:16.080
for the sake of the project.

39:17.749 --> 39:21.152
Okay, I'll try, but
it'll never work.

39:47.111 --> 39:48.811
<i>So just call
me back or whatever.</i>

39:48.846 --> 39:50.347
<i>We need to talk.</i>

39:52.216 --> 39:55.085
Hey. So, is he better?

39:55.153 --> 39:56.953
Yeah, he's really
come a long way.

39:56.987 --> 40:00.957
His weight's back up, and his
legs are healing nicely.

40:00.991 --> 40:03.292
And... what about you?

40:05.362 --> 40:08.431
Ty told me you rode
those horses all the way home.

40:08.465 --> 40:09.866
Were you scared?

40:09.934 --> 40:11.500
Actually, yeah.

40:11.535 --> 40:13.603
A little, at first.

40:13.637 --> 40:15.772
But then it went away.

40:15.839 --> 40:17.873
All on its own.

40:17.907 --> 40:20.042
And I was okay.

40:20.077 --> 40:21.544
I'm glad.

40:22.845 --> 40:23.812
Me too.

40:25.082 --> 40:26.449
Hey.

40:26.483 --> 40:28.084
<i>Hey.</i>

40:28.151 --> 40:28.884
Well, he's looking good!

40:28.918 --> 40:30.519
Yeah.

40:32.855 --> 40:34.355
Okay...

40:34.390 --> 40:37.559
I'm gonna just leave
you two alone.

40:37.594 --> 40:40.295
I'm worried about him, though.

40:40.329 --> 40:41.830
I don't know what's going on
in his head.

40:41.898 --> 40:45.033
He's like the saddest horse
I've ever seen.

40:45.101 --> 40:47.268
Well, wounds can heal.

40:47.336 --> 40:51.272
Psychological scars, on the other
hand, they take a bit of time.

40:51.340 --> 40:54.061
Why do I get the feeling you're
talking about more than just a horse?

40:55.411 --> 40:58.480
You never have to pretend
with me Amy, okay?

40:58.514 --> 41:01.116
You knew I wasn't ready
to ride.

41:01.183 --> 41:03.651
I had a feeling.

41:03.719 --> 41:06.887
Just like I had a feeling you
wouldn't wait for me at the stables.

41:06.955 --> 41:08.889
Which we can discuss later.

41:08.957 --> 41:10.424
I know, I know,
I should've waited.

41:10.492 --> 41:12.093
I totally get that.

41:12.160 --> 41:14.729
But I guess sometimes
I can be...

41:14.796 --> 41:16.230
A little stubborn.

41:16.297 --> 41:18.032
Sometimes?

41:18.100 --> 41:20.001
Okay, most of the time.

41:20.068 --> 41:21.769
Well, that I can deal with.

41:21.837 --> 41:23.870
Although I do find it
kind of...

41:23.938 --> 41:26.006
What?

41:26.040 --> 41:27.907
Adorable.

41:27.975 --> 41:29.543
Really.

41:34.415 --> 41:36.683
I got your message.

41:36.751 --> 41:39.485
Now what do you want?

41:39.520 --> 41:42.288
I know you wanna win
the 4h competition.

41:42.356 --> 41:44.157
And what makes you so sure?

41:44.191 --> 41:45.759
Because I wanna win
the 4h competition!

41:45.826 --> 41:48.261
And you know what?

41:48.328 --> 41:55.934
If we could just get over ourselves,
without having to be friends...

41:55.969 --> 41:59.172
What happens in the sheep pen,
stays in the sheep pen?

41:59.206 --> 42:01.340
Yeah, something like that.

42:01.375 --> 42:06.912
But we have to work as a team,
<i>for the sake of the project.</i>

42:06.946 --> 42:08.581
For the sake of little...

42:08.615 --> 42:09.582
Beyonce.

42:11.951 --> 42:13.518
Okay.
