WEBVTT

00:04.173 --> 00:05.607
'Sup, guys?

00:05.609 --> 00:07.676
What do you think
of my sweater?!

00:09.445 --> 00:10.812
It only has one arm.

00:10.814 --> 00:13.382
I could take it or "sleeve" it.

00:13.384 --> 00:17.953
Is it just me, or are my
jokes getting better?

00:17.955 --> 00:20.422
It's just you.

00:20.424 --> 00:23.492
I made this sweater
for my Dezzie.

00:23.494 --> 00:25.227
I'm taking a knitting class.

00:25.229 --> 00:27.662
Can you believe this is the
first thing she ever knitted?

00:27.664 --> 00:28.697
What?!

00:28.699 --> 00:31.299
- No way.
- I have eyes.

00:31.301 --> 00:32.934
Well, let's get out
of here, Ally.

00:32.936 --> 00:35.404
It's time to celebrate
our one-month-iversary.

00:35.406 --> 00:38.273
We're going to the
pickle factory.

00:38.275 --> 00:40.308
Isn't Gavin the sweetest?

00:43.780 --> 00:45.881
It must be hard seeing
Ally with someone else.

00:45.883 --> 00:50.218
It was weird at first, but
I'm ready to move on.

00:50.220 --> 00:51.853
I know the perfect girl.

00:51.855 --> 00:54.489
She's tall, sweet,
easy on the eyes.

00:54.491 --> 00:56.324
Sadly, she's taken.

00:56.326 --> 00:58.026
Love you, babe. Boop!

00:59.630 --> 01:01.863
Lucky for you,
Carrie has a sister.

01:01.865 --> 01:03.698
Oh, that's a great idea.
You'd love her.

01:03.700 --> 01:05.534
She's just like me.

01:05.536 --> 01:08.236
Only, kinda forgetful.

01:08.238 --> 01:12.774
Oh, which reminds me, I forgot
to turn off the dishwasher.

01:17.447 --> 01:20.515
I have a feeling her sister's
probably not my type.

01:20.517 --> 01:23.285
Maybe this will
change your mind.

01:26.856 --> 01:28.690
Yeah, definitely not my type.

01:28.692 --> 01:32.794
Are you sure? 'Cause I've met her, and
she's every bit as amazing as Carrie.

01:37.967 --> 01:40.268
Bubbles taste weird.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.074

02:38.327 --> 02:40.862
Ally, I have big news.

02:40.864 --> 02:42.964
Have you ever heard
of Armand Bianchi?

02:42.966 --> 02:45.100
Of course! He's that
celebrity designer

02:45.102 --> 02:49.104
who made that one red carpet
dress out of red carpet.

02:49.106 --> 02:51.406
Well, I got you a
meeting with him.

02:51.408 --> 02:54.009
Wearing one of his dresses
would be great exposure.

02:54.011 --> 02:56.511
Yeah! I could make the
best-dressed list.

02:56.513 --> 02:57.913
Or the worst-dressed list.

02:57.915 --> 02:59.014
But who cares?

02:59.016 --> 03:00.216
As long as you're on the list.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.165
Thanks so much for
setting this up, Trish.

03:04.820 --> 03:06.955
Uh, what's this?

03:06.957 --> 03:08.957
It looks like yarn.

03:08.959 --> 03:11.026
It goes all the way up
to the practice room.

03:13.996 --> 03:16.531
Hey! Who's pulling me?

03:16.533 --> 03:19.034
What's with the sweater shorts?

03:19.036 --> 03:21.102
One leg is shorter
than the other.

03:21.104 --> 03:24.072
Man, I must have unraveled.

03:24.074 --> 03:25.707
I'll go have Carrie fix them.

03:34.417 --> 03:36.618
Should we tell him they're
still unraveling?

03:36.620 --> 03:38.720
He's gonna be in his
underwear any minute.

03:38.722 --> 03:41.022
Meh, he'll find out soon enough.

03:50.166 --> 03:52.701
Ever since Ally and Dez
got in relationships,

03:52.703 --> 03:54.502
I've got no one
to hang out with.

03:54.504 --> 03:56.771
So I'm really glad
we're doing this.

03:56.773 --> 03:58.840
I'm glad we're doing this too.

03:58.842 --> 04:00.642
I really enjoy these moments.

04:00.644 --> 04:02.677
Aww, thanks!

04:02.679 --> 04:04.079
I feel the same way.

04:04.081 --> 04:05.513
Huh?

04:05.515 --> 04:08.149
Oh, sorry, I was talking
to my boyfriend.

04:08.151 --> 04:09.484
Say that again, Jace.

04:11.921 --> 04:14.089
Oh, Jace...

04:14.091 --> 04:16.591
Well, at least I got
you, beach ball.

04:16.593 --> 04:17.858
You'll never leave me.

04:21.096 --> 04:23.164
Aw, come on.

04:27.770 --> 04:29.204
<i>Ow!</i>

04:29.206 --> 04:32.507
Hey! Watch where
you're throwing those.

04:32.509 --> 04:33.942
Sorry.

04:33.944 --> 04:35.143
Ooh.

04:38.481 --> 04:40.048
Whoa.

04:40.050 --> 04:41.850
Hello.

04:42.985 --> 04:46.021
I mean...

04:46.023 --> 04:47.455
'Sup?

04:47.457 --> 04:48.556
I'm Austin.

04:48.558 --> 04:51.126
I know who you are.
I'm a big fan.

04:52.662 --> 04:56.131
I mean, 'sup. I'm Piper.

04:57.167 --> 04:59.134
Some more are coming in.

04:59.136 --> 05:01.069
Those waves are getting big.

05:01.071 --> 05:03.838
Actually, I'm waiting
for them to get bigger.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.240
Really?

05:05.242 --> 05:08.076
Those waves are too
small for you?

05:08.078 --> 05:10.779
Me too.

05:10.781 --> 05:13.014
So, how come I haven't seen
you around here before?

05:13.016 --> 05:15.116
I usually surf by my house.

05:15.118 --> 05:19.020
But there's much better scenery
here, if you know what I mean.

05:19.022 --> 05:20.221
Thanks.

05:21.123 --> 05:22.991
I did some pushups earlier.

05:24.995 --> 05:29.164
I was talking about the
beach, spaghetti arms.

05:29.166 --> 05:32.000
Are you sure you're doing
those pushups right?

05:32.002 --> 05:33.835
Very funny.

05:33.837 --> 05:35.236
You just wanted to touch my arm.

05:35.238 --> 05:36.705
Maybe.

05:36.707 --> 05:38.973
You wanna go surfing tomorrow?

05:38.975 --> 05:40.975
Are you asking me out?

05:40.977 --> 05:43.511
What can I say?

05:43.513 --> 05:46.748
You rode a wave right
into my heart.

05:46.750 --> 05:48.583
Wow.

05:48.585 --> 05:51.019
I hope your surfing's
better than your flirting.

05:51.021 --> 05:53.688
Me too.

05:53.690 --> 05:54.789
So what do you say?

05:54.791 --> 05:56.124
It's a date.

05:59.029 --> 06:02.063
Hey, there's supposed to be some
killer 20-foot waves in the morning.

06:02.065 --> 06:03.998
Great.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.900
Then I'll see you after lunch.

06:20.182 --> 06:22.083
Thanks again for setting
up that meeting.

06:22.085 --> 06:24.619
You know, Armand Bianchi's one
of my favorite designers.

06:24.621 --> 06:26.054
Me too.

06:26.056 --> 06:28.790
Remember that dress he made
out of live snapping turtles?

06:28.792 --> 06:30.225
Yeah.

06:30.227 --> 06:33.661
I wonder if that model
ever got her nose back.

06:35.564 --> 06:38.099
Greetings! Everyone
feeling splendid?

06:39.635 --> 06:42.003
- Did you just say "splendid"?
- Yeah.

06:42.005 --> 06:44.005
I'm going on a date
with this amazing girl.

06:44.007 --> 06:47.008
So I looked up a bunch of new words
to make her think I'm smart.

06:47.010 --> 06:50.111
You all look quite adolescent.

06:52.181 --> 06:54.149
I love it that you're
learning new words.

06:54.151 --> 06:57.685
Maybe next you can
learn what they mean.

06:57.687 --> 06:59.888
You guys are really
gonna like my date.

06:59.890 --> 07:02.624
She's beautiful, she's
funny, she surfs.

07:02.626 --> 07:04.025
Well, does she floss?

07:04.027 --> 07:05.994
'Cause you can tell a lot
about a girl by her gums.

07:05.996 --> 07:06.995
Ahh.

07:06.997 --> 07:08.062
Uh...

07:08.064 --> 07:09.164
Yeah, this one's feisty.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.267
Here she is now!

07:13.836 --> 07:15.136
Guys?

07:15.138 --> 07:16.137
Meet my date.

07:16.139 --> 07:17.806
Piper?

07:17.808 --> 07:19.107
Hey, Carrie.

07:19.109 --> 07:20.275
You guys know each other?

07:20.277 --> 07:22.110
Yeah, she's my sister.

07:22.112 --> 07:23.344
What?

07:23.346 --> 07:28.383
Piper's the kooky girl Dez wanted to
set you up with in the first place?

07:28.385 --> 07:30.151
Wait...

07:30.153 --> 07:33.154
Yeah, I wanted to
set you two up...

07:33.156 --> 07:38.326
But when I showed Austin your picture,
he was all like, "blech! Ugh! Yeesh!"

07:38.328 --> 07:40.328
Really?

07:40.330 --> 07:42.997
So, I wasn't good
enough for you?

07:42.999 --> 07:45.133
No, I... I can explain.

07:45.135 --> 07:48.837
Dez showed me this picture,
and your face was all...

07:48.839 --> 07:50.171
Not like it is now.

07:52.675 --> 07:55.243
That was from "nerd
day" at school.

07:55.245 --> 07:57.145
Well, I'm glad we
cleared that up.

07:57.147 --> 08:01.883
It bothers me that all you
care about are looks.

08:01.885 --> 08:03.318
What if that wasn't a costume?

08:03.320 --> 08:04.886
It could have been real.

08:04.888 --> 08:07.155
Haven't you ever gone
through an awkward phase?

08:07.157 --> 08:11.793
I think we're all feeling a
little awkward right now.

08:12.761 --> 08:14.128
Actually, I'm enjoying myself.

08:15.998 --> 08:17.999
You can forget about
that date, Austin.

08:18.001 --> 08:20.034
I don't wanna go out with
a guy who's this shallow.

08:20.036 --> 08:23.104
I'm not shallow. I just
like pretty girls.

08:25.875 --> 08:27.942
Wait, that sounded bad!

08:27.944 --> 08:30.144
So, where you guys
going on your date?

08:40.722 --> 08:42.423
How can Piper think I'm shallow?

08:42.424 --> 08:46.961
Would a shallow guy spend three hours
making his hair look like this?

08:46.963 --> 08:48.096
Yes, he would.

08:49.365 --> 08:52.233
I spent three hours putting on
this outfit Carrie gave me.

08:52.235 --> 08:54.002
I don't know why
she gave me two.

08:55.104 --> 08:57.071
I think those are socks.

08:58.407 --> 09:01.910
Ohh, that's why it took
me three hours to put on.

09:03.012 --> 09:05.380
How can I show Piper I'm deep?

09:05.382 --> 09:11.019
I love may 10th, when you cried
after seeing that double rainbow.

09:11.021 --> 09:13.154
I fell off my skateboard.

09:13.156 --> 09:16.157
There just happened to be a
double rainbow at the same time.

09:16.159 --> 09:18.192
Forget the rainbows!

09:18.194 --> 09:20.361
Just do something
thoughtful for her.

09:20.363 --> 09:22.330
Find out what she likes
to eat and cook for her.

09:22.332 --> 09:25.867
Yeah! Girls love it when you
care about stuff they like.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.936
Why else would I be wearing
a sock dress all day?

09:30.072 --> 09:33.341
All right. Then I'm gonna be
into whatever Piper's into.

09:33.343 --> 09:35.076
What do you think
she likes to eat?

09:35.078 --> 09:36.311
Carrie said she's a vegan.

09:36.313 --> 09:38.112
And I'm a capricorn.

09:38.114 --> 09:40.248
But what does she like to eat?

09:47.890 --> 09:49.857
Um, no no no no.

09:51.328 --> 09:53.962
- Ahh, you must be Trish.
- Mm-hmm.

09:53.964 --> 09:57.065
Oh, no. Mwah Mwah
Mwah Mwah Mwah Mwah.

09:58.033 --> 09:59.153
Wow, that's a lot of kisses.

10:00.337 --> 10:01.502
Thank you for meeting us, Mr.
Bianchi.

10:01.504 --> 10:03.137
You're our favorite
clothing designer.

10:03.139 --> 10:04.806
Oh, I'm not a designer!

10:04.808 --> 10:09.978
I'm merely a vessel through which pattern
and fashion birth into the universe.

10:09.980 --> 10:11.312
Sounds messy.

10:11.314 --> 10:13.147
Hi, I'm Ally.

10:13.149 --> 10:14.515
- Great to meet you.
- Oh!

10:14.517 --> 10:17.118
Mwah Mwah Mwah Mwah Mwah Mwah...

10:17.120 --> 10:18.086
Oh!

10:18.088 --> 10:21.089
Only six. We just met.

10:23.292 --> 10:25.360
Ally, you are quite beautiful.

10:26.363 --> 10:28.896
How would you...

10:28.898 --> 10:31.966
Like to be my new muse?

10:31.968 --> 10:34.168
Are you serious?

10:34.170 --> 10:36.204
I've never made a
joke in my life.

10:36.206 --> 10:41.075
And besides, I've grown
bored of my former muse.

10:41.077 --> 10:43.077
Jamie, you're boring!

10:43.079 --> 10:44.178
And fired!

10:47.816 --> 10:51.489
I have a show this
weekend, and I'd like you

10:51.501 --> 10:55.185
to wear the crown jewel
of my collection.

10:58.428 --> 11:00.161
Thank you.

11:00.163 --> 11:06.367
This coat is made entirely of feathers
from the exotic jub-jub bird...

11:06.369 --> 11:09.537
A rare and distant
relative of the peacock.

11:09.539 --> 11:12.073
Oh, it's beautiful.

11:12.075 --> 11:17.078
Yes, this fashion show will help
raise money to prevent their...

11:17.080 --> 11:18.112
Extinction.

11:18.114 --> 11:21.382
You know what else would
prevent their extinction?

11:21.384 --> 11:23.284
Not making coats out of them.

11:24.320 --> 11:30.124
I only use the feathers that naturally fall
off the birds in my private sanctuary.

11:30.126 --> 11:34.295
Well, no one's gonna be able
to pull it off like our Ally.

11:46.276 --> 11:48.609
We'll work on that.

11:48.611 --> 11:50.244
Yeah.

11:57.453 --> 12:00.288
I hope you're waxing
up an appetite.

12:00.290 --> 12:02.223
Because I have some
treats for you.

12:02.225 --> 12:04.892
They're pretty delinquent.

12:06.228 --> 12:08.463
I don't think you're
using that word right.

12:08.465 --> 12:10.531
Listen...

12:10.533 --> 12:13.901
I wanna prove to you
that I'm not shallow.

12:13.903 --> 12:15.970
I spent all night
writing you this poem.

12:20.075 --> 12:22.543
"I know I was rude and
came off kinda jerky,

12:22.545 --> 12:26.347
so I made you some food.
Enjoy this tofu Turkey."

12:26.349 --> 12:28.149
It rhymes.

12:28.151 --> 12:32.086
Look, Austin, I already told you
I don't wanna go out with you.

12:32.088 --> 12:34.021
Maybe this will
change your mind.

12:35.124 --> 12:39.060
I heard you're a vegan, so once
I figured out what that meant,

12:39.062 --> 12:43.097
I made you tofu with
carrots, carrot souffle...

12:43.099 --> 12:46.234
Carrot soup, carrot cake...

12:46.236 --> 12:49.504
You realize, they make
other vegetables.

12:50.707 --> 12:54.142
Look, Piper, just give me
a chance to prove myself.

12:54.144 --> 12:56.144
I'll do anything you're into.

12:56.146 --> 12:58.246
Really?

12:58.248 --> 12:59.614
Anything I'm into?

12:59.616 --> 13:01.449
Okay.

13:01.451 --> 13:05.653
Well, for starters, I don't
believe in bottled water.

13:05.655 --> 13:07.555
I... I don't believe
in it either.

13:07.557 --> 13:09.123
But, look, it's real.

13:11.593 --> 13:15.663
I mean, it's not
natural enough for me.

13:15.665 --> 13:18.332
I prefer coconut water.

13:18.334 --> 13:20.468
Straight from the tallest trees.

13:22.371 --> 13:25.173
Um... okay.

13:25.175 --> 13:27.542
I'll be right back.

13:27.544 --> 13:29.277
Hoo!

13:33.415 --> 13:35.149
What are you up to?

13:35.151 --> 13:36.617
You don't drink coconut water.

13:36.619 --> 13:39.720
I know. I'm testing him.

13:39.722 --> 13:45.026
He says he's a genuine guy who's really
into me, and I wanna see how far he'll go.

13:45.028 --> 13:46.627
Ooh, I like that.

13:46.629 --> 13:48.162
It's so delinquent.

13:48.164 --> 13:49.497
<i>Aww!</i>

13:49.499 --> 13:52.200
<i>There's a bird's nest up here!</i>

13:52.202 --> 13:56.103
<i>Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow ow!</i>

13:59.441 --> 14:03.110
So, I watched models on TV to
come up with my own runway walk.

14:03.112 --> 14:05.179
I call this "the
fish out of water."

14:12.354 --> 14:14.488
I think we should
throw that one back.

14:14.490 --> 14:16.057
Okay.

14:16.059 --> 14:18.192
How about "the lost tourist"?

14:29.605 --> 14:32.440
Eh, can I give that to her...
some directions?

14:32.442 --> 14:35.343
How about... don't
walk like that?

14:35.345 --> 14:37.078
Okay.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.347
You'll love "the prancing pony."

14:48.357 --> 14:49.790
Ooh!

15:03.672 --> 15:05.406
Oh. Sorry, caveman guy.

15:05.408 --> 15:07.275
Dez, it's me.

15:07.277 --> 15:09.610
Oh.

15:13.516 --> 15:17.218
Piper made me give up
clothes, soap, toothpaste...

15:17.220 --> 15:18.753
Even my hair products.

15:20.188 --> 15:22.223
But your hair was
so perfect before.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.225
It's all you had!

15:24.227 --> 15:26.260
Well, what about my
singing and dancing?

15:26.262 --> 15:27.395
Ooh.

15:27.397 --> 15:29.230
A lot of people sing
and dance, buddy.

15:30.399 --> 15:32.667
So, is Piper gonna
go out with you now?

15:32.669 --> 15:34.201
No.

15:34.203 --> 15:36.337
She still thinks I'm
some shallow guy.

15:37.874 --> 15:39.774
I don't know what else I can do.

15:39.776 --> 15:43.210
She seems to be all about
saving the animals.

15:43.212 --> 15:46.113
Protest this fashion show.

15:46.115 --> 15:48.816
They're using feathers
from endangered animals.

15:49.785 --> 15:53.788
"Armand Bianchi debuts his
one-of-a-kind jub-jub coat."

15:53.790 --> 15:55.222
She'll hate this!

15:55.224 --> 15:57.258
I'll go down there
and hold up a sign.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.293
Oh-ho, no no no no no! Amateur.

15:59.295 --> 16:00.895
You need to think bigger.

16:00.897 --> 16:03.864
Like dump buckets of
paint on all the models.

16:05.167 --> 16:06.467
That's a great idea!

16:06.469 --> 16:08.803
You get Piper there. I'll
take care of the rest.

16:08.805 --> 16:12.173
How about I get Piper there and
you take care of your breath?

16:12.175 --> 16:13.441
Whoo!

16:21.616 --> 16:23.451
Thanks for covering
my shift, Carrie.

16:23.453 --> 16:25.586
I couldn't miss Ally's
first fashion show.

16:25.588 --> 16:27.288
No problem.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.657
You sure you don't wanna
wear my latest knit shirt?

16:29.659 --> 16:31.158
That's a hat.

16:31.160 --> 16:33.461
No. It's a shirt.

16:33.463 --> 16:36.397
I just couldn't get
it over my head.

16:38.900 --> 16:40.434
How's it going, Dez?

16:40.436 --> 16:42.536
I am outraged.

16:42.538 --> 16:44.171
And you will be too, Piper.

16:44.173 --> 16:46.674
Austin found out there are
these poor defenseless birds,

16:46.676 --> 16:51.345
whose feathers are being used to
make coats, pants and skirts.

16:51.347 --> 16:54.248
Ooh, I bet those feather
skirts are cute.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.217
Uh, super cute.

16:56.219 --> 16:57.785
Wait...

16:57.787 --> 17:00.421
I thought you were against
using animals for anything.

17:00.423 --> 17:03.257
Yeah, about that...

17:03.259 --> 17:07.828
Um, I'm not really anti-feather
or anti-soap or anti-leather.

17:07.829 --> 17:10.397
Or antidisestablishmentarianism.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.233
I learned that word
in history class.

17:12.234 --> 17:15.869
I don't know what it means, but
I've been dying to use it.

17:15.872 --> 17:19.205
I was just messing with Austin
to see if he was really into me.

17:19.208 --> 17:22.242
It turns out, he's a
really great guy.

17:22.244 --> 17:26.914
So you completely embarrassed and
humiliated a person just to prove a point?!

17:26.915 --> 17:31.485
I'm gonna stop making him
do all that crazy stuff.

17:31.487 --> 17:33.654
Mm, you should have stopped
him 10 minutes ago.

17:33.656 --> 17:36.991
He's now at the fashion show protesting
the abuse of some weird jub-jub bird.

17:37.993 --> 17:39.960
Did you say jub-jub bird?

17:39.962 --> 17:42.963
Dez, no one's abusing the birds!

17:42.965 --> 17:44.999
The show's raising
money to save them!

17:45.001 --> 17:46.767
And Ally's the starring model.

17:46.769 --> 17:48.335
What?!

17:48.337 --> 17:49.937
Ally's a model?

17:49.939 --> 17:51.872
Have you seen that
girl walk in heels?

17:51.874 --> 17:53.674
Yeah, it's ugly.

17:53.676 --> 17:58.379
Austin's gonna drop buckets of paint
on Ally and the other models.

17:58.381 --> 17:59.513
Oh, I'll call him!

17:59.515 --> 18:01.749
Ooh, that might be a problem.

18:01.751 --> 18:05.252
Austin got rid of his phone when I told
him I didn't believe in technology.

18:16.731 --> 18:18.766
Austin! Austin!

18:18.768 --> 18:20.434
Piper!

18:20.436 --> 18:22.002
I'm so glad you're here.

18:22.004 --> 18:24.472
I'm about to stop this
disgusting fashion show.

18:24.474 --> 18:25.506
You don't have to.

18:25.508 --> 18:26.774
I know.

18:26.776 --> 18:29.610
That's just the kind of
non-superficial guy I am.

18:29.612 --> 18:34.315
I lie awake at night thinking
about those poor jub-jub birds.

18:34.317 --> 18:36.383
Austin, she's been
messing with you.

18:36.385 --> 18:40.754
She's manipulative and deceitful and has
a lot of other great qualities too.

18:40.756 --> 18:42.723
I'm sorry, Austin.

18:42.725 --> 18:44.425
I was just testing you.

18:44.427 --> 18:46.460
I'm not really against
all that stuff.

18:46.462 --> 18:49.964
So, I wore this potato
sack for nothing?

18:49.966 --> 18:53.334
I ate vegetables for nothing!

18:53.336 --> 18:55.669
Well, the vegetables
weren't for nothing.

18:55.671 --> 18:57.304
I am a vegan.

18:57.306 --> 18:58.706
I can't believe this.

18:58.708 --> 19:00.608
I'm just glad we
found you in time.

19:00.610 --> 19:03.077
Now you won't ruin
Ally's fashion show.

19:03.079 --> 19:05.746
Ally's in this?

19:05.748 --> 19:08.883
Oh, no, she's gonna get covered in
paint when this timer goes off!

19:08.885 --> 19:10.484
- Well, turn it off!
- I can't!

19:10.486 --> 19:12.052
Oh...

19:13.555 --> 19:15.022
We have to get her attention.

19:15.024 --> 19:16.690
Ally! Ally!

19:18.026 --> 19:19.894
She thinks we're
cheering her on.

19:19.896 --> 19:22.429
Ally! Ally!

19:22.431 --> 19:24.832
We have five seconds.
Do something.

19:26.402 --> 19:28.569
Look out, Ally!

19:35.076 --> 19:37.478
Saved it.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.079
Ally!

19:39.081 --> 19:40.347
Oh! Oh, my...

19:40.349 --> 19:42.049
My precious angel!
Are you okay?!

19:42.051 --> 19:44.752
I got this, sir. She's
my precious angel.

19:44.754 --> 19:47.087
I was talking about my coat!

19:47.089 --> 19:49.056
Is it... is it ruined?!

19:49.058 --> 19:50.991
Austin, what's going on?

19:50.993 --> 19:52.893
I'll tell you what's going on.

19:52.895 --> 19:57.765
This monster tried to ruin the
most important piece of clothing

19:57.767 --> 20:02.036
hate to interrupt, but you might
wanna yell at me a bit further away.

20:02.038 --> 20:03.470
Huh?

20:03.472 --> 20:04.638
Oh...

20:04.640 --> 20:07.141
Fly, my jub-jub, fly!

20:14.649 --> 20:16.016
Is she safe?

20:19.754 --> 20:21.555
Sorry again for lying to you.

20:21.557 --> 20:24.725
I understand why you
thought I was shallow.

20:24.727 --> 20:26.160
I'm really sorry too.

20:26.162 --> 20:27.962
Can we start over?

20:27.964 --> 20:29.730
I'd like that.

20:30.966 --> 20:33.133
'Sup? I'm Austin.

20:33.135 --> 20:36.136
'Sup? I'm Piper.

20:36.138 --> 20:37.938
Wanna go surfing?

20:37.940 --> 20:41.575
I hear there are some killer
20-foot waves tomorrow morning.

20:41.577 --> 20:42.610
Great.

20:42.612 --> 20:44.044
Then I'll see you after lunch.

20:44.597 --> 20:46.013
Not 'cause I'm
scared of big waves,

20:46.015 --> 20:49.116
'cause it's gonna take me that long
to get my hair looking good again.

20:54.122 --> 20:56.490
Austin, I can't believe it.

20:56.492 --> 20:57.858
I know.

20:57.860 --> 21:01.128
I'm really sorry I
ruined your show.

21:01.130 --> 21:02.162
No.

21:02.164 --> 21:04.064
I mean you and Piper.

21:04.066 --> 21:05.899
I'm really happy for you.

21:05.901 --> 21:07.201
Thanks.

21:07.203 --> 21:09.470
So you're not mad at me
for causing all this?

21:09.472 --> 21:13.140
No. I think it's romantic you made a
fool of yourself to impress a girl.

21:13.142 --> 21:15.509
But I ruined your
modeling debut.

21:15.511 --> 21:18.512
Eh, I'm sure I would have
ruined it sooner or later.

21:18.514 --> 21:20.080
Have you seen me walk in heels?

21:20.082 --> 21:21.915
Ahh.

21:21.917 --> 21:23.117
Oh!

21:31.694 --> 21:36.497
Armand Bianchi saw the knit clothes
you wore at the fashion show,

21:36.499 --> 21:38.899
and wants to feature you
in his next photo shoot.

21:38.901 --> 21:40.034
No way!

21:40.036 --> 21:43.070
But I didn't know
I was that good.

21:43.072 --> 21:45.739
Trust me, none of us did.

21:45.741 --> 21:48.909
I finally get to put my
supermodel good looks to use.
