SKYLAR:
Forty-two years ago,

01:11.330 --> 01:14.920
our beloved kingdom
of Avalor was invaded

01:14.920 --> 01:19.750
by an evil sorceress
named Shuriki.

01:19.750 --> 01:21.750
Even in sparkles,
she looks mean.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.710
Uh, Skylar,
the story?

01:23.710 --> 01:25.290
Oh, right.

01:25.290 --> 01:28.750
The kingdom suffered
under her rule for
many years.

01:28.750 --> 01:31.330
Mortoloz Imagenar!

01:31.330 --> 01:34.880
Until the day that
Princesa Elena
finally returned.

01:34.880 --> 01:37.830
She bravely led the charge
against Shuriki,

01:37.830 --> 01:39.330
and saved the kingdom

01:39.330 --> 01:42.120
from the darkest
threat we've ever faced.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.000
But as guardians
of Avalor,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
that was supposed
to be our job.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.420
The guardians need
to be stronger, smarter,

01:49.420 --> 01:51.920
and faster than
ever before,

01:51.920 --> 01:54.880
so we're ready the next time
there's danger in Avalor.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.000
Well said, Skylar.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.620
Oh, thanks,
Chief Zephyr.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.460
I've been practicing
all week.

02:00.460 --> 02:03.290
Ciela, Avión, Nico.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.830
Tomorrow, you will take
the Guardian Test.

02:05.830 --> 02:09.830
If you pass, you will
become Guardians of Avalor.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.790
If you fail,

02:11.790 --> 02:15.880
you must return to our home
realm of Vallestrella.

02:15.880 --> 02:19.040
Hopefully, your Navegera
prepared you well.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.580
Skylar's
the best teacher ever.

02:21.580 --> 02:24.580
Well, we'll find out
in the morning.

02:24.580 --> 02:26.710
For Vallestrella!

02:26.710 --> 02:28.710
ALL: For Avalor!

02:30.120 --> 02:31.670
I meant what I said.

02:31.670 --> 02:33.710
You're also
the best big bro.

02:33.710 --> 02:35.750
Ha ha.
Thanks, baby bro.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.920
Now, you all better
get some rest.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.710
You've got
a big day tomorrow.

02:42.710 --> 02:44.460
Nico's worked so hard.

02:44.460 --> 02:46.330
I hope he passes.

02:46.330 --> 02:47.710
Don't worry.
He will.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.670
Elena, it's
getting late.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.880
- You should head
back to the palace.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.500
I have to give
the grand council

02:53.500 --> 02:55.670
a state-of-the-kingdom
update in the morning.

02:55.670 --> 02:58.920
Can you believe it's been
one year since I became
crown princess?

02:58.920 --> 03:01.710
Wow! I guess tomorrow's
a big day for all of us.

03:03.920 --> 03:07.920
He has no idea
how right he is.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.420
Are you sure
it's a good idea

03:09.420 --> 03:10.750
for us to come
back here, Papa?

03:10.750 --> 03:12.210
We were lucky
she didn't lock us up

03:12.210 --> 03:14.420
after we tried
stealing the crown jewels.

03:14.420 --> 03:17.790
My dearest Carla,
by the time she
knows we're back,

03:17.790 --> 03:19.710
it will be too late.

03:19.710 --> 03:22.330
Avalor will
already be ours,

03:22.330 --> 03:24.880
and they will
all regret the day

03:24.880 --> 03:28.580
they wronged
Victor Delgado.

03:28.580 --> 03:31.580
And Carla Delgado.

03:34.750 --> 03:37.790
ELENA: Okay, so it hasn't
always been smooth sailing.

03:37.790 --> 03:39.710
But the kingdom is safer,

03:39.710 --> 03:41.920
and more prosperous
than ever.

03:41.920 --> 03:45.080
I mean, I know it's not
that hard to do better
than a wicked sorceress.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.830
But all things considered,

03:46.830 --> 03:49.710
I think it's been
a pretty good year.

03:49.710 --> 03:52.830
- The grand council
disagrees.

03:52.830 --> 03:54.880
It's been a great year!

03:56.080 --> 03:58.710
You have ruled well.

03:58.710 --> 04:01.250
With the help of
the grand council, of course.

04:01.250 --> 04:04.710
Elena Castillo Flores,

04:04.710 --> 04:07.170
the council awards you
this Medal of Honor

04:07.170 --> 04:09.420
for all you have done
for Avalor

04:09.420 --> 04:12.580
in your first year
as crown princess.

04:12.580 --> 04:14.920
I'm proud of you, mija.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.710
Congratulations, Elena.

04:16.710 --> 04:18.920
Thanks, Naomi.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.830
I have to say,
I think I finally got
this ruling thing down,

04:21.830 --> 04:24.330
which is good because
'cause it's only three years

04:24.330 --> 04:26.670

How to make an exit.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.120
Mm-hmm.

06:21.710 --> 06:25.080
The Guardian Test will challenge
your reflexes, strength,

06:25.080 --> 06:27.000
agility and intelligence.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.710
And this year,
the test was designed by

06:29.710 --> 06:31.920
the royal wizard and Migs.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.670
So it will be harder
than ever.

06:35.670 --> 06:38.710
Make way, make way.
Princess coming through.

06:38.710 --> 06:40.710
Oh, and I got Elena, too.

06:40.710 --> 06:42.750
- You made it!
- I wouldn't miss
this for the world.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.880
I'm rooting for
you guys.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.750
Thanks, princesa.

06:46.750 --> 06:49.500
Migs, why don't you tell
them what's in store.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.920
Gladly.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.880
The test is in
two parts.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.500
First is
the battle test.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.960
A magical enemy will
appear from one of
the caves below.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.500
You must dodge the enemy's
spell blasts,

07:00.500 --> 07:02.380
and tag the enemy
with your wings.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.620
You get hit,
you're out.

07:04.620 --> 07:07.330
The second part
is search and rescue.

07:07.330 --> 07:10.170
You each have to find
three statuettes

07:10.170 --> 07:12.880
that Mateo hid in
the Via Mercado,

07:12.880 --> 07:15.830
and bring them safely
back to the pedestal below.

07:15.830 --> 07:17.330
You have ten minutes.

07:17.330 --> 07:19.790
Ten minutes?
Heartless.

07:19.790 --> 07:21.290
Only ten minutes?

07:21.290 --> 07:22.920
That's not
very long.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.540
You guys trained
for this.

07:24.540 --> 07:26.210
You'll do fine.

07:26.210 --> 07:28.210
Hey, go get 'em, Nico.

07:30.170 --> 07:33.620
Let the Guardian Test
begin!

07:33.620 --> 07:35.920
Mortoloz Chihimagenos!

07:38.580 --> 07:40.750
- Good luck.
- You'll need it.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.830
NICO: Let's go, amigos.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.580
Ciela, Avión, look out!

08:08.580 --> 08:11.000
I've got an idea.
Follow me.

08:16.620 --> 08:17.960
Now break.

08:21.790 --> 08:23.580
Get ready to tag her.

08:25.710 --> 08:27.750
Yeah!

08:27.750 --> 08:29.500
Good teamwork.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.120
You have all passed
the first challenge.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.830
Slap me
some wings.

08:34.830 --> 08:38.710
And now, on to
the search and rescue.

08:38.710 --> 08:40.710
Mortoloz Cahuimatla!

08:42.750 --> 08:44.710
Remember, you only have
ten minutes

08:44.710 --> 08:46.080
to find the statuettes.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.420
- Go!
- Come on.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.290
I can't find
anything.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.880
Neither can I.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.380
We're almost
out of time.

09:03.380 --> 09:05.040
Hey, look at
that weird shadow.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.750
- It's just the fountain.
- No, it's not.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.330
It's something
behind the fountain.

09:09.330 --> 09:10.710
Come on.

09:12.580 --> 09:14.040
There's nothing here.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.210
Or is there?

09:16.210 --> 09:17.540
You found one!

09:17.540 --> 09:20.460
They used magic to make
the statue invisible,

09:20.460 --> 09:22.080
but it still
cast a shadow.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.920
They're invisible?

09:23.920 --> 09:25.790
- There's no way
Ciela and I have time--
- Found one.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.000
Avión, I'm not
going back

09:30.000 --> 09:31.750
until you find
your statue,

09:31.750 --> 09:34.540
- so you better
start looking.
- Okay.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.710
I think I see it.

09:40.210 --> 09:41.790
All right!

09:41.790 --> 09:43.080
Now let's get back.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.330
Where are they?
Time is running out.

09:47.330 --> 09:48.500
Look!

09:48.500 --> 09:50.540
Here they come!

09:52.170 --> 09:53.790
Yes!

09:53.790 --> 09:56.120
All right, Avión!

09:56.120 --> 09:57.750
Come on, Nico.

10:00.750 --> 10:04.420
Almost there.

10:04.420 --> 10:05.710
What?!

10:06.830 --> 10:08.080
No!

10:08.080 --> 10:09.750
Yes.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.250
I don't know
what happened.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.250
It just shattered.

10:13.250 --> 10:15.710
He brought it this far.
Isn't that good enough?

10:15.710 --> 10:17.460
I wish it was,

10:17.460 --> 10:19.580
but it's
a search and rescue test.

10:19.580 --> 10:21.250
You broke the statue.

10:21.250 --> 10:24.670
Sorry, but you failed
the test.

10:24.670 --> 10:27.750
Ciela, Avión,
congratulations.

10:27.750 --> 10:29.790
You are Guardians.

10:29.790 --> 10:33.080
Skylar, will you escort
Nico back?

10:33.080 --> 10:34.880
Yes, Chief.

10:36.920 --> 10:39.540
You would've made
a great Guardian, Nico,

10:39.540 --> 10:41.040
and I'm gonna miss you.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.670
We all will.

10:42.670 --> 10:45.120
I really thought
I was going to make it.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.790
Come on, Nico.

10:52.250 --> 10:55.290
Come along, Carla.
We got what we came for.

10:55.290 --> 10:56.790
I don't get it.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.710
Why do we care
if a jaquin fails some test?

10:59.710 --> 11:01.330
Because we need to go
to Vallestrella

11:01.330 --> 11:02.960
for my plan to work.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.710
But only jaquins
can open the gateway,

11:04.710 --> 11:06.670
so we have to get there
before they do.

11:06.670 --> 11:08.620
Now hurry up,
will you.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.830
It's not fair. It was Nico
who figured out

11:11.830 --> 11:13.380
how to find the statues.

11:13.380 --> 11:14.920
- Yeah.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.460
If it wasn't for him,
we never would've passed.

11:17.460 --> 11:19.710
Then maybe Nico deserves
a second chance.

11:19.710 --> 11:22.540
Sorry, there are
no second chances.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.380
It's against
the rules.

11:24.380 --> 11:26.750
Who made these rules?
Chief Zephyr?

11:26.750 --> 11:30.170
No. Verago,
the king of the jaquins.

11:30.170 --> 11:32.540
Also known as Skylar
and Nico's father.

11:32.540 --> 11:34.080
Well, then, I'll just ask
King Verago

11:34.080 --> 11:35.750
to make an exception.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.080
You can't do that.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.710
You have to go
to our realm,

11:38.710 --> 11:40.710
and humans are not
allowed there.

11:40.710 --> 11:42.460
But this is
a special case,

11:42.460 --> 11:44.250
and I am
the crown princess.

11:44.250 --> 11:45.540
Will one of you
take me?

11:45.540 --> 11:46.880
- No way.
- Hop on.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.330
- Luna!

11:48.330 --> 11:50.080
I agree with
the princess.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.710
Nico should get
another shot.

11:51.710 --> 11:54.420
Wait. As your
royal wizard,
and friend,

11:54.420 --> 11:56.290
I am advising you
not to go to a realm

11:56.290 --> 11:58.040
where you're not welcome.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.920
Thanks for your advice, Mateo,
but I have to do this.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.830
For Nico.

12:02.830 --> 12:04.880
Come on, Luna.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.790
Migs, I can't let her
go there alone.

12:06.790 --> 12:07.710
You have to take
me, too.

12:07.710 --> 12:09.120
No, I don't.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.290
Well, let's at least
try to stop her.

12:11.290 --> 12:13.710
Fine.

12:22.580 --> 12:24.460
Well, this is
it, Nico.

12:24.460 --> 12:25.830
Time to go home.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.330
Hurry, it's closing.

12:34.790 --> 12:35.960
No, we're too late.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.920
Ow! Why did I
just do that?

12:38.920 --> 12:41.880
Ugh! Now how are we going
to get into Vallestrella?

12:41.880 --> 12:43.830
LUNA: Watch your head,
princess.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.500
Quick, hide!

12:49.120 --> 12:51.000
Hang on tight.
Watch the feathers.

12:53.290 --> 12:54.670
Hurry, Carla,
before it closes.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.330
Wow!

13:12.330 --> 13:16.380
We are not in
Avalor anymore.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.040
Oh, there they are.

13:43.500 --> 13:46.670
- Skylar, Nico.

13:46.670 --> 13:48.790
Whoa. What are
you guys doing here?

13:48.790 --> 13:51.120
I'm gonna ask your father
to let Nico take the test again.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.880
No, you're not.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.830
We have to turn around
and go back

13:54.830 --> 13:56.620
before anyone knows
we're here.

13:56.620 --> 13:58.000
What's the worst
that can happen?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.830
King Verago says no?

13:59.830 --> 14:02.620
Knowing our dad,
that's the best thing
that could happen.

14:04.290 --> 14:05.620
Come on, Luna.

14:07.710 --> 14:08.920
MATEO: Elena!

14:12.080 --> 14:13.710
Come along, Carla.

14:13.710 --> 14:15.420
I don't see how
being here helps us.

14:15.420 --> 14:18.210
Because this is where
they keep Marimonda.

14:18.210 --> 14:19.710
What's a marimonda?

14:19.710 --> 14:21.620
Not what. Who.

14:21.620 --> 14:25.040
Marimonda is a rebellious
forest sprite

14:25.040 --> 14:28.120
who is going to help us
take over Avalor.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.120
But first,
we have to free her.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.830
Free her from where?

14:31.830 --> 14:34.080
Let me show you.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.880
Where'd you get
a map of this place?

14:36.880 --> 14:39.120
An old friend
gave it to me.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.880
There, on the other
side of the valley.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.920
It could take us
days to get there.

14:47.380 --> 14:50.710
- I don't know.

14:50.710 --> 14:53.120
But they're fast.

14:55.790 --> 14:58.750
- Hang on, Carla!

15:23.710 --> 15:25.710
Oh, Skylar,
what have you done?

15:25.710 --> 15:28.080
- You know humans
aren't allowed--
- Father!

15:28.080 --> 15:29.830
Are you
out of your mind?

15:29.830 --> 15:31.960
You can't let
King Verago
see them.

15:33.830 --> 15:35.500
Yeah. Too late.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.960
Hi, Dad.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.500
Skylar! Ay-yi-yi.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.750
Before you get mad,

15:51.750 --> 15:54.330
this is
Crown Princesa Elena,

15:54.330 --> 15:56.920
and her royal wizard,
Mateo.

15:56.920 --> 16:00.080
Ah, welcome to
Vallestrella, princess.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.120
Oh, uh, thank you.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.790
Now you must go.

16:03.790 --> 16:05.920
My sons should not
have brought you here.

16:05.920 --> 16:08.750
They simply do not
know any better.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.750
As usual.

16:10.750 --> 16:13.380
Actually, I was the one
who insisted on coming.

16:13.380 --> 16:15.750
Today, Nico failed
his Guardian Test,

16:15.750 --> 16:17.830
but I really don't think
it was his fault.

16:17.830 --> 16:21.710
So I came to ask you
to please give Nico
a second chance.

16:23.210 --> 16:25.380
I do not know how you
do things in Avalor,

16:25.380 --> 16:27.120
but here in Vallestrella,

16:27.120 --> 16:29.710
we have rules
that we must follow,

16:29.710 --> 16:32.120
which means
no second chances.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.120
Told ya.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.500
Glad we got that
all cleared up.
Elena, shall we?

16:37.880 --> 16:39.880
King Verago,
ruler to ruler,

16:39.880 --> 16:41.960
is it really
such a big deal

16:41.960 --> 16:43.540
if Nico takes
the test again,

16:43.540 --> 16:45.500
or if there are people
in Vallestrella?

16:45.500 --> 16:47.170
Yes, it is.

16:47.170 --> 16:49.580
A very big deal.

16:49.580 --> 16:51.880
And since you do not
seem to be leaving,

16:51.880 --> 16:55.250
I guess I will have
to show you just how big it is,

16:55.250 --> 16:56.960
ruler to ruler.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.880
Vallestrella
is much more important

17:00.880 --> 17:03.210
than you know, princess.

and accidentally unearthed
Kizin, an evil monster.

18:12.380 --> 18:15.670
It was the biggest battle
we have ever fought.

18:15.670 --> 18:19.960
We won, but there
was a great cost.

18:19.960 --> 18:23.670
Those pits are the scars that
remain of that fateful day.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.120
I had no idea.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.710
There is much
we protect Avalor from

18:29.710 --> 18:31.920
that you do not know of.

18:31.920 --> 18:34.000
But that is why humans
are not allowed here,

18:34.000 --> 18:39.080
and why we follow

I'm sorry, Nico.

19:31.540 --> 19:32.960
I tried.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.790
Right up there.

19:39.790 --> 19:41.000
Here we are.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.420
Uh, there's nothing
out there.

19:43.420 --> 19:45.710
Not yet.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.250
One of these
magical jewels

20:00.250 --> 20:02.790
keeps Marimonda
locked inside.

20:02.790 --> 20:05.460
We pull the right one,
she goes free.

20:05.460 --> 20:07.750
We pull the wrong jewel,

20:07.750 --> 20:10.710
we join her in there.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.380
I don't like
our odds.

20:12.380 --> 20:15.460
Not to worry.
The map will
show us the way.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.670
Ah ha ha.

20:28.540 --> 20:30.580
There it is.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.120
I hope
you're right.

20:46.540 --> 20:48.290
Hello?

20:53.880 --> 20:55.120
I'm free! I'm free!

20:55.120 --> 20:56.620
Oh, can it be?

20:56.620 --> 20:57.880
I'm filled with glee!

20:57.880 --> 21:00.040
All thanks to thee!

21:00.040 --> 21:02.670
You are very welcome,
Marimonda.

21:02.670 --> 21:06.120
But you will not
be filled with glee

21:06.120 --> 21:08.710
when you see what
they have done to Avalor.

21:08.710 --> 21:13.750
They have built cities
and castles and towns
everywhere.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.080
I tried to show them
long ago

21:16.080 --> 21:18.920
that nothing's good
unless it grows.

21:18.920 --> 21:20.460
I completely agree,

21:20.460 --> 21:22.080
which is why I freed you,

21:22.080 --> 21:25.290
so you can return Avalor
to its natural glory.

21:25.290 --> 21:27.580
Yes, I have
no time to waste.

21:27.580 --> 21:29.710
To Avalor I'll go in haste.

21:29.710 --> 21:31.250
I'll visit
every ugly town,

21:31.250 --> 21:34.580
and use my vines
to tear them down.

21:37.540 --> 21:39.120
Oh! One more thing.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.880
You'll need a jaquin
to open the gateway.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.880
Thank you for
the good advice.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.880
I'm off
to bring back paradise!

21:49.750 --> 21:53.380
Perfect. Now we must return
to Avalor as well.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.920
I don't get how the plant lady
is going to help us

21:55.920 --> 21:57.210
take over Avalor.

21:57.210 --> 21:59.250
You'll see
soon enough, Carla.

21:59.250 --> 22:01.750
They'll all see.

22:06.170 --> 22:08.710
King Verago,
Marimonda has escaped.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.920
One of the dark forces
I told you about.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.790
Marimonda is a wicked
forest sprite

22:15.790 --> 22:18.500
who once tried to destroy
every city in Avalor.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.920
We have to stop her.

22:19.920 --> 22:22.120
That won't be easy.

22:22.120 --> 22:24.710
Centuries ago, the sunbirds
used ancient magic

22:24.710 --> 22:26.710
to capture Marimonda.

22:26.710 --> 22:28.920
But the sunbirds
are all gone now.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.920
What about
the sunbird oracle,

22:33.080 --> 22:34.920
Someone so old and wise,

22:34.920 --> 22:36.830
they can even see
the future.

22:36.830 --> 22:40.040
I bet Quita Moz
would know how to
stop Marimonda.

22:40.040 --> 22:43.920
Quita Moz disappeared
with the other sunbirds
years ago.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.330
Some say he's still here,

22:46.330 --> 22:49.540
in a hidden nest way up
in the Picolago mountains.

22:49.540 --> 22:51.500
Then we have to go
try and find him.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.920
Only a fool
would waste time

22:53.920 --> 22:56.670
looking for something
that isn't there.

22:56.670 --> 22:58.080
With all due respect,

22:58.080 --> 23:00.250
I've dealt with
my fair share of emergencies.

23:00.250 --> 23:01.880
I've been ruling
a whole year.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.330
Oh, a whole year.

23:04.330 --> 23:07.580
Well, I have been
ruling for over 50.

23:07.580 --> 23:10.540
Skylar, Luna, take
the humans to the gateway.

23:10.540 --> 23:13.120
Migs, you and the rest
of the jaquins, come with me.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.120
We must prepare
to capture Marimonda.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.710
I know what
King Verago said,

23:19.710 --> 23:22.380
but my instincts are telling me
we have to find that oracle.

23:22.380 --> 23:24.460
Were your instincts listening
when the king of this realm

23:24.460 --> 23:26.040
told us to leave?

23:26.040 --> 23:28.880
Mateo, I have a duty
to protect Avalor.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.750
We all do.
Skylar?

23:30.750 --> 23:32.670
I don't know...

23:32.670 --> 23:34.120
I'm with the princesa.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.040
I may not be
a real Guardian,

23:36.040 --> 23:37.790
but we have to do
whatever we can

23:37.790 --> 23:39.460
to save Avalor
and Vallestrella.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.750
My Navegera taught me that.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.330
I'm in.

23:43.330 --> 23:45.250
Me, too.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.330
Elena, are you sure you know
what you're getting into?

23:47.330 --> 23:50.330
Trust me. I know
exactly what I'm doing.

23:50.330 --> 23:52.830
Then we
better get searching.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.540
Okay, according
to the etching,

24:01.540 --> 24:04.750
Quita Moz's nest
is on an island in a lake

24:04.750 --> 24:06.420
with three mountain
peaks above it.

24:06.420 --> 24:07.710
No island in this lake.

24:07.710 --> 24:10.420
Then let's move on
to the next one.

24:14.710 --> 24:17.170
Over there!

24:20.120 --> 24:21.710
She moves fast.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.750
Then we'll have
to move faster.

24:23.750 --> 24:26.170
But even if we catch her,
how are we going to hold her?

24:31.040 --> 24:34.750
We lure her into
one of the pits.

24:34.750 --> 24:36.540
And seal her inside.

24:36.540 --> 24:37.750
Exactly.

24:37.750 --> 24:39.540
Now who wants
to be the bait?

24:40.750 --> 24:43.380
- Me.
- Ah, thanks
for volunteering.

24:43.380 --> 24:45.460
- But I didn't--
- We have a trap to set.

24:45.460 --> 24:47.580
Let's fly, amigos.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.380
Elena, we gave it
a try,

24:52.380 --> 24:54.040
but we should really
head back now.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.830
Not until we find
Quita Moz.

24:55.830 --> 24:58.460
LUNA: Oh, that one
has three peaks.

24:58.460 --> 25:00.460
SKYLAR: But there's nothing
on the island.

25:06.750 --> 25:09.880
Hey, guys, check out
the island's shadow.

25:09.880 --> 25:12.790
It looks like a sunbird.

25:12.790 --> 25:14.790
The oracle's nest
has to be here.

25:14.790 --> 25:17.500
Where? All I see
is a bunch of rocks.

25:17.500 --> 25:18.790
There's no nest
in sight.

25:18.790 --> 25:21.500
Maybe it's not
meant to be in sight.

25:22.620 --> 25:23.670
Reveal!

25:25.710 --> 25:27.620
There's an underground tunnel.

25:27.620 --> 25:29.380
- MATEO: It looks like...

25:29.380 --> 25:30.920
a giant nest.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.750
You found
the oracle, Nico.

25:32.750 --> 25:34.880
Now we just need
to find a way inside.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.250
There must be some way
to get through that rock.

25:39.250 --> 25:41.540
I can blast it.
Blaze!

25:43.380 --> 25:45.920
Huh? It went right through.

25:47.460 --> 25:48.960
Maybe 'cause
it's not really there,

25:48.960 --> 25:50.670
like those spells
you did, Mateo.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.880
Huh.

25:56.710 --> 25:59.120
It is an illusion.

26:01.620 --> 26:03.460
Ugh, it's too dark in here.

26:03.460 --> 26:05.330
Glow.

26:14.830 --> 26:16.170
Are you okay?

26:16.170 --> 26:19.620
Yeah. The scepter
makes me tired

26:19.620 --> 26:20.920
if I use it too much.

26:27.710 --> 26:28.920
Come on.

26:38.670 --> 26:40.750
Welcome.

26:43.500 --> 26:46.670
I've been expecting you.

26:46.670 --> 26:48.170
What about my friends?

26:48.170 --> 26:52.080
No, I can't say
I was expecting them,

26:52.080 --> 26:54.290
but I don't see everything.

26:54.290 --> 26:55.880
Are you Quita Moz?

26:55.880 --> 26:58.170
You better hope so
after coming all this way.

26:58.170 --> 27:00.580
I am Crown Princess Elena...

27:00.580 --> 27:01.750
of Avalor.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.540
I know who you are.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.920
I saw you
in the flames.

27:05.920 --> 27:07.750
You see things
in the fire?

27:07.750 --> 27:10.790
Oh, yes,
all sorts of things.

27:10.790 --> 27:13.790
The past, the present,
and the future.

27:13.790 --> 27:15.920
Sometimes the fire
speaks to me,

27:15.920 --> 27:17.500
like a dozen
hissing whispers

27:17.500 --> 27:18.880
all talking at once.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.880
I'm here because
Marimonda has gotten loose,

27:21.880 --> 27:23.880
and I'm hoping
you know how to stop her.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.670
Oh, is that
the scepter of light?

27:25.670 --> 27:27.250
Hey!

27:27.250 --> 27:30.500
It's been a long time
since I last saw the scepter,

27:30.500 --> 27:33.080
or somebody who had
the ability to use it.

27:33.080 --> 27:35.000
Tell me, what powers
have you learned?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.620
Uh, I can make it light up.

27:37.620 --> 27:39.710
Blast things,
see through walls.

27:39.710 --> 27:41.500
What about illusions?

27:41.500 --> 27:43.790
No, but we should really
get back to... hold on.

27:43.790 --> 27:46.170
The scepter can
make illusions?

27:46.170 --> 27:49.250
It can manipulate
and control light
in all its forms.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.380
You know, if you're
gonna run around with
that thing,

27:51.380 --> 27:54.670
you might want to take
the time to learn
all its powers.

27:54.670 --> 27:56.290
I will, right after we--

27:56.290 --> 27:57.710
To form an illusion,

27:57.710 --> 28:00.170
you just have to say
the word "envision,"

28:00.170 --> 28:02.750
and then whatever
you say next will appear.

28:02.750 --> 28:04.330
Go on, try it.

28:04.330 --> 28:06.790
Envision.
Uh... Isabel.

28:09.580 --> 28:11.420
Not bad for
your first try.

28:11.420 --> 28:13.580
Okay, let's move on
to the next power.

28:13.580 --> 28:15.790
Uh, Quita Moz,
I would really
love to learn

28:15.790 --> 28:17.420
all the scepter powers,

28:17.420 --> 28:19.420
but right now,
I need to stop Marimonda.

28:19.420 --> 28:22.380
Young humans,
always in a hurry.

28:22.380 --> 28:24.620
Here. You'll need this.

28:24.620 --> 28:25.790
A jar?

28:25.790 --> 28:27.120
An enchanted jar.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.000
Get Marimonda to go
inside it,

28:29.000 --> 28:30.960
and the lid will
magically seal her in.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.790
Then you can bring her
back to me for safe keeping.

28:34.790 --> 28:38.000
Okay, but how do I get
Marimonda to go inside it?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.540
That is a good question.

28:40.540 --> 28:42.920
I hope you figure it out
before you see her.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.750
Adios!

28:47.830 --> 28:49.290
- I'm okay.

28:49.290 --> 28:51.920
I was just talking
to Quita Moz,

28:51.920 --> 28:53.290
and he gave me
this jar.

28:53.290 --> 28:54.880
He gave you a jar?

28:54.880 --> 28:56.920
We can use it
to capture Marimonda.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.120
Nico, can you carry it?

28:58.120 --> 28:59.920
Of course.

28:59.920 --> 29:01.750
Uh, are you sure
you want him to carry it?

29:01.750 --> 29:03.710
You remember the last time
he carried something.

29:03.710 --> 29:05.040
I think he can handle it.

29:13.880 --> 29:16.250
Be the bait, Migs.
Be the bait.

29:16.250 --> 29:17.830
Coming through!

29:17.830 --> 29:20.380
A jaquin wants
to play with me?

29:20.380 --> 29:22.790
This game will not
end well for thee.

29:22.790 --> 29:25.960
Oh, no, I'm so scared.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.880
You should be.

29:34.290 --> 29:36.830
Get ready.
Here she comes.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.080
There she is.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.580
LUNA: Is that Migs?

29:43.580 --> 29:44.960
He's in trouble.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.500
Wait until
she's over the pit,

29:47.500 --> 29:49.830
and then,
on my command,
push.

29:51.880 --> 29:54.880
Come on.
Just a few more feet.

29:56.710 --> 29:58.040
Now! Push!

29:58.040 --> 30:00.880
There's nowhere left
for you to go.

30:01.920 --> 30:03.380
Blaze!

30:06.830 --> 30:08.080
Gotcha!

30:08.080 --> 30:10.080
Guess again,
my jaquin pest.

30:10.080 --> 30:12.710
Time for you
to join my quest.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.040
Migs!

30:16.040 --> 30:17.380
I'll get him.
Vetzi!

30:19.790 --> 30:21.880
Nice try.
Bye-bye.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.790
What are you still
doing here?

30:23.790 --> 30:25.460
We had a trap set.

30:25.460 --> 30:27.580
I didn't know.
I'm sorry.

30:27.580 --> 30:29.420
Sorry won't undo
what you've done.

30:29.420 --> 30:31.670
I know.
I can fix this.

30:32.710 --> 30:34.040
- Elena!
- Skylar!

30:38.500 --> 30:40.290
There's no need
for you to fret.

30:40.290 --> 30:43.460
I won't need you
long, my pet.

30:44.750 --> 30:48.000
- There she is.
- Got it.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Be careful
not to hit Migs.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.710
Right.
Blaze.

30:53.290 --> 30:55.580
Missed.
Where did she go?

30:55.580 --> 30:57.080

32:48.210 --> 32:50.420
Yeah. I'm just
catching my breath.

32:50.420 --> 32:52.040
She's headed
toward the gateway,

32:52.040 --> 32:53.790
and she can use Migs
to open it.

32:53.790 --> 32:55.790
I know, I know.

32:55.790 --> 32:58.250
I have an idea,
but we'll need
to get there first.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.210
Skylar, you lie down
there with the jar.

33:06.210 --> 33:09.120
I'll make an illusion
Marimonda can't resist.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.960
Then she'll step
right into our trap.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.920
You've got it,
princesa.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.500
Lying down
is my specialty.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.380
Envision a house.

33:20.330 --> 33:22.540
The sight of that
makes my eyes sore.

33:22.540 --> 33:26.290
Now you'll see
just what's in store for Avalor.

33:30.920 --> 33:34.040
Come on.
Just a few more feet.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.170
One more step.

33:39.830 --> 33:41.330
Surprise.

33:41.330 --> 33:43.380
Victor, Carla?

33:45.920 --> 33:47.750
Ha ha.

33:47.750 --> 33:50.750
Was this a trap?
We can't have that.

33:53.290 --> 33:55.750
Thank you,
Marimonda.

33:55.750 --> 33:57.080
You know her?

33:57.080 --> 33:58.750
Who do you think
freed her?

33:58.750 --> 34:01.210
And I have
you to thank for
that as well.

34:01.210 --> 34:02.960
If it wasn't for you,

34:02.960 --> 34:04.790
we wouldn't have
gotten into Vallestrella

34:04.790 --> 34:06.330
in the first place.

34:06.330 --> 34:09.170
- Yes, you.

34:09.170 --> 34:11.120
We snuck in
behind you.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.960
Anyone going to Avalor?

34:12.960 --> 34:16.170
'Cause I'm about
to open the door.

34:16.170 --> 34:17.920
Carla, time to go.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.880
Why are you
doing this, Victor?

34:20.880 --> 34:24.080
You should have let me
steal the royal jewels
the last time we met.

34:24.080 --> 34:28.380
Now, I will steal
much, much more from you.

34:37.540 --> 34:40.170
Good-bye, Elena.

34:40.170 --> 34:41.920
No!

34:41.920 --> 34:43.880
What happened?

34:43.880 --> 34:46.670
It was Victor and Carla.

34:46.670 --> 34:48.710
They were
behind it all.

34:49.710 --> 34:52.790
King Verago,
you were right.

34:52.790 --> 34:54.880
I should've
listened to you.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.040
I'm sorry.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.710
You should be.

34:57.710 --> 35:00.210
You and my sons have
brought ruin upon Avalor.

35:00.210 --> 35:02.290
No, we didn't.

35:02.290 --> 35:04.960
What did you
say to me?

35:04.960 --> 35:07.710
I said we didn't
ruin anything.

35:07.710 --> 35:09.830
Nico found
the sunbird oracle,

35:09.830 --> 35:11.500
and Elena got
an enchanted jar from him

35:11.500 --> 35:13.330
that can trap
Marimonda forever.

35:13.330 --> 35:15.960
If you'd teamed up with Elena
instead of kicking her out,

35:15.960 --> 35:18.500
we would've
caught her already.

35:22.120 --> 35:27.710
Ah, I have been
waiting for this day
for years.

35:27.710 --> 35:30.120
- This is the first time

35:30.120 --> 35:32.330
you've stood up
for what you believe in, eh.

35:32.330 --> 35:36.290
Such courage is the sign
of a true leader.

35:36.290 --> 35:39.920
King Verago, I may have
been right about the oracle,

35:39.920 --> 35:41.830
but I messed up your plan.

35:41.830 --> 35:43.880
I tried to go after
Marimonda myself

35:43.880 --> 35:45.540
when I could've
used some help.

35:45.540 --> 35:47.670
I thought I had it
all figured out,

35:47.670 --> 35:50.920
but you've been ruling
a lot longer than I have,

35:50.920 --> 35:52.880
so I'm ready
to listen now.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.920
Ruler to ruler,

35:54.920 --> 35:57.330
I say we come up
with a plan

35:57.330 --> 36:00.170
- on the way to Avalor.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.790
Right after
someone unties Migs.

36:09.830 --> 36:13.420
Such a hideous,
vile town.

36:13.420 --> 36:16.080
I can't wait
to knock it down.

36:28.080 --> 36:30.080
Chief Zephyr, there's
something chasing

36:30.080 --> 36:31.750
the townspeople
out of the city.

36:31.750 --> 36:34.330
What kind of something?

36:47.750 --> 36:49.880
I've never seen
such frightful towers.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.170
I'll fill them with
delightful flowers.

36:52.170 --> 36:54.880
I don't think so.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.790
Try, try with
all your might.

36:57.790 --> 37:00.290
But you can't catch
this forest sprite.

37:00.290 --> 37:03.670
Ciela, Avión,
warn the royal family.

37:09.330 --> 37:10.790
There she is.

37:10.790 --> 37:12.420
She's headed for
the palace.

37:12.420 --> 37:14.710
Do you really think
this plan will work?

37:14.710 --> 37:15.710
BOTH: It better.

37:17.420 --> 37:19.620
GABE: Stay back.
The guards will handle this.

37:19.620 --> 37:20.830
She's getting closer.

37:23.170 --> 37:24.790
Shut the gates.

37:27.080 --> 37:28.750
Elena!

37:28.750 --> 37:31.540
- The realm of the jaquins.

37:31.540 --> 37:34.000
Looks like you brought
a few back with you.

37:38.580 --> 37:40.420
We need someone
to get in front of her.

37:40.420 --> 37:41.620
- I'll do it.
- Nico!

37:45.670 --> 37:46.710
Too slow.

37:51.330 --> 37:53.170
Ha ha, we got her.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.920
This is oh so fun,
playing with you.

37:57.920 --> 38:01.290
Don't look now,
'cause I'm not through.

38:04.210 --> 38:05.670
Ta-da!

38:05.670 --> 38:07.460
Get her!

38:15.790 --> 38:17.790
I'll stop her.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.920
You are not
going in there.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.750
You can try a trick,
but I'm too quick.

38:29.750 --> 38:31.290
Conglari!

38:34.120 --> 38:36.710
Finally, my victory!

38:39.920 --> 38:41.380
- ELENA: Guess what,
Marimonda?

38:46.290 --> 38:48.830
You can be caught
after all.

38:56.710 --> 38:59.580
Nice illusion,
princesa.

38:59.580 --> 39:02.620
Oh! Thanks.

39:02.620 --> 39:04.670
How'd you learn
to do that?

39:04.670 --> 39:08.250
It's a long story.

39:09.920 --> 39:12.170
King Verago,
we got her.

39:12.170 --> 39:14.120
Just like we planned.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.380
Nico.

39:15.380 --> 39:18.330
Today you have proven
you have what it takes

39:18.330 --> 39:20.380
to be a Guardian.

39:20.380 --> 39:21.750
So you'll let me
take the test again?

39:21.750 --> 39:23.620
No.

39:23.620 --> 39:26.420
This was bigger
than any test,

39:26.420 --> 39:29.920
and you have passed
with flying colors.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.290
That's
my baby bro!

39:32.290 --> 39:34.920
Now we just need
to find Victor and Carla.

39:34.920 --> 39:37.330
Victor Delgado
was behind this?

39:37.330 --> 39:40.790
He was trying to use Marimonda
to take over Avalor.

39:40.790 --> 39:42.420
I thought he would've
followed her here.

39:42.420 --> 39:44.750
Captain, assemble a team
of your best royal guards

39:44.750 --> 39:47.750
- to track them down.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

39:47.750 --> 39:50.960
Now, I have to take
this back where it belongs.

39:56.290 --> 39:58.380
Uh, should I...

40:02.250 --> 40:03.920
Welcome back, Elena.

40:03.920 --> 40:06.250
You can put her over there.

40:09.170 --> 40:10.710
Thank you.

40:10.710 --> 40:12.920
That illusion power
came in handy.

40:12.920 --> 40:15.290
I had a feeling
it would.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.250
Uh...
what's going on?

40:23.250 --> 40:26.170
Something is coming
for you, princess.

40:26.170 --> 40:29.670
A darkness,
rising out of the shadows.

40:29.670 --> 40:32.880
You will be tested,
and if you do not
pass this test,

40:32.880 --> 40:35.710
you will never be crowned

40:35.710 --> 40:37.460
queen of Avalor.

40:37.460 --> 40:39.790
What are you
talking about?

40:39.790 --> 40:41.920
The flames spoke to me,

40:41.920 --> 40:44.000
about you,
about your future.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.790
But what test?

40:45.790 --> 40:47.080
What darkness?

40:47.080 --> 40:49.000
That the flames
did not say.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.040
But you must
prepare yourself, Elena.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.620
You must be ready for
whatever is coming.

41:06.290 --> 41:09.040
It is my great honor

41:09.040 --> 41:12.540
to proclaim you
Guardians of Avalor.

41:14.460 --> 41:16.670
Nico, your mother
will be proud...

41:16.670 --> 41:18.790
of both of you.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.750
They fell for it,

41:33.750 --> 41:36.040
just like
you said they would.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.040
They went after
Marimonda,

41:38.040 --> 41:39.880
and we got
the jewel.

41:54.830 --> 41:56.920
You did well, Victor.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.880
Thank you,
Shuriki,

41:59.880 --> 42:02.790
my old friend.

42:02.790 --> 42:05.710
Shuriki is
your old friend?

42:05.710 --> 42:08.960
Well, I'm not
so old anymore.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.750
Now you will
make us wizards.

42:11.750 --> 42:13.250
Patience, Victor.

42:13.250 --> 42:15.580
I still need
more magic.

42:15.580 --> 42:19.880
But when my powers
are fully restored,

42:19.880 --> 42:24.790
then I will make you
both malvagos,

42:24.790 --> 42:28.120
and Avalor will be ours.

42:33.330 --> 42:35.250
Is everything okay?

42:35.250 --> 42:37.960
You've been distracted
since you got back
from the oracle.

42:37.960 --> 42:39.290
I'm...

42:39.290 --> 42:40.830
just a little tired.

42:40.830 --> 42:42.830
That's all.

42:42.830 --> 42:44.670
Hey, Mateo, um...

42:44.670 --> 42:48.040
don't stop
giving me advice, okay?

42:48.040 --> 42:49.750
I think
I'm gonna need it.

42:49.750 --> 42:52.880
I'll always be here
for you, Elena.

42:52.880 --> 42:54.920
No matter what.

42:54.920 --> 42:56.670
Come on, you two.

42:58.040 --> 42:59.710
For Vallestrella.

42:59.710 --> 43:01.540
ALL: For Avalor!
