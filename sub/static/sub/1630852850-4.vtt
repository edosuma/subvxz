WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.880
You know, there isn't actually
a name for it,

00:03.880 --> 00:06.920
being the male lover
of a married woman.

00:06.920 --> 00:09.640
Of course, if it was
the other way around,

00:09.640 --> 00:14.240
you'd be my mistress.
Yeah, that's the accepted term.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.480
But... what am I?

00:19.920 --> 00:21.400
Your master.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.840
Definitely not.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.960
Your lover, obviously.

00:27.960 --> 00:31.280
But I just think we should have
our own word.

00:32.840 --> 00:34.840
Mister.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.920
"Actually, we're not married.
I'm her mister."

00:37.920 --> 00:39.760
I've got a word for you.
Do you want to hear it?

00:39.760 --> 00:42.360
It's quite short. Have you heard
from your current husband?

00:42.360 --> 00:43.800
No. Not yet.

00:43.800 --> 00:46.200
And right now, I'm reconsidering
my decision to divorce him.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.240
So if you don't mind...

00:47.240 --> 00:51.400
As your concubine,
I am nothing if not obedient.

00:51.400 --> 00:56.160
I shall retire to my chamber
and await your pleasure.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.120
SHE CHUCKLES
Idiot.

01:32.960 --> 01:37.520
HE RECITES PRAYER

01:51.920 --> 01:53.240
VOICE FALTERS

01:53.240 --> 01:55.360
THEY GASP,
PANICKED CHATTER

02:29.320 --> 02:33.080
And Dr Sharma will hold the fort
in casualty.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.560
Yes, Dr Fonseca. And thank you...

02:34.560 --> 02:39.040
Which just leaves Dr Kapoor's
regular paediatric outreach clinic.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.800
Now, normally, that would be
Dr Walker's responsibility,

02:41.800 --> 02:45.120
but in her absence,
I thought you two could go.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.160
Er, slight problem.
I'm not a paediatrician.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.400
Didn't your mother tell you that you
could be anything you wanted to be?

02:51.400 --> 02:53.440
Well, actually, she used to beat me.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.120
Use your common sense.
If that doesn't work for you,

02:56.120 --> 02:58.760
just ask Sister Mari.
Right, that's it, get out.

03:01.600 --> 03:05.240
Lydia, last night,
a patient was admitted in emergency.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.400
Ramesh Kurup.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.840
Ah-pa-pa-pa. Pick one.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.080
I call shotgun.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.360
HE CHUCKLES

03:35.040 --> 03:37.760
So, if I had chosen the hand
with the keys in it,

03:37.760 --> 03:39.640
would you still have made me drive?

03:39.640 --> 03:42.160
Definitely not.
It was a totally fair game. Hmm.

03:42.160 --> 03:45.800
Wake me when we get there.
HE SIGHS

03:45.800 --> 03:47.680
KEYS JANGLE,
IGNITION

03:47.680 --> 03:49.480
He collapsed during puja.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.720
So we feared a heart attack
because of his diabetes. Mm-hm.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.720
But it turned out to be septicaemia.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.760
Maybe kidney infection.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.880
Seems like he's responding well
to treatment.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.840
Yes, it seems so.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.800
But I'm worried about this.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.480
Maybe you should tell him?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.560
Dr Fonseca! Look at this.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.040
Chess on a computer!

04:22.040 --> 04:25.240
Now I can beat this fool
from the comfort of my own home.

04:25.240 --> 04:28.440
It is an iPad, not a computer.
Like you understand the difference.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.080
Open up your mind, old man,
now that you can do anything online!

04:31.080 --> 04:33.720
Did you know, my son can stream
his Friday prayers

04:33.720 --> 04:35.440
all over the planet?

04:35.440 --> 04:38.000
OK, who had 30 seconds?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.680
We all have a sweepstake.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.800
You have to guess how long
it will be before he mentions

04:42.800 --> 04:44.680
that his son is an imam.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.040
It's good to be proud
of your children, no?

04:47.040 --> 04:49.080
Right, Doctor?
I... I wouldn't know.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.960
But I do know I need
to speak to Ramesh.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.480
Alone, please.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.440
Moideen is my oldest friend.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.800
How can I have a secret from him?

04:58.800 --> 05:02.560
Anyway, I feel fine now.
Just an infection, right?

05:02.560 --> 05:03.840
Can I get out of here?

05:03.840 --> 05:06.280
No. No, I'm afraid not.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.160
Nothing as beautiful as this
back home.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.560
I mean, there is, but...

05:21.160 --> 05:22.560
Ever been to the UK?

05:22.560 --> 05:25.400
So, we're mainly doing
routine exams.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.880
London has its own charm.
Developmental checks...

05:28.880 --> 05:32.520
This... it feels like actual living.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.440
COCKNEY ACCENT: I do miss
a good old fish 'n' chips, though.

05:35.440 --> 05:37.840
From the local chippy back home.

05:37.840 --> 05:41.520
Are you going to be doing that
ALL day?

05:41.520 --> 05:44.640
They're expecting
top medical professionals,

05:44.640 --> 05:47.400
not Mr Mary Poppins.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.080
AS HUGH GRANT: Yes, Sister.
Terribly sorry.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.120
Absolutely best behaviour
from now on.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.440
Stop that,
that's what I'm talking about.

05:56.720 --> 06:01.240
Ramesh, these results confirm
that your chronic renal disease

06:01.240 --> 06:03.520
has advanced - significantly.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.720
I'm afraid your kidneys are failing.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.760
But there is a treatment, yes?

06:10.760 --> 06:14.560
Well, we can replace the function
by starting you on dialysis.

06:14.560 --> 06:18.440
And then he's as good as new?
Keep quiet, old man!

06:18.440 --> 06:20.000
It's not a cure.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.720
How often? In your case,
I'd say... three times a week.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.520
But we'd need to start immediately.

06:30.480 --> 06:34.160
No. I saw what dialysis
did to my uncle.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.480
Ramesh...

06:37.480 --> 06:39.720
your kidneys are failing very fast.

06:39.720 --> 06:43.440
Without treatment, you will slip
into a coma... and you will die.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.600
What about transplant?

06:46.600 --> 06:48.960
You remember old Mahmood?
He was like new.

06:48.960 --> 06:51.640
Although the old one was not much
to write home about.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.400
Transplants take time.
There's a list.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.920
You can't just snap your fingers
and order one. He's right.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.080
It could be months, years.

06:59.080 --> 07:02.120
If there was any alternative,
I'd offer it to you.

07:02.120 --> 07:05.600
But right now,
dialysis is your only option.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.840
No dialysis.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.400
If these are to be my last days,
then so be it.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.360
And that's the last I will say
on the matter.

07:40.440 --> 07:41.680
Oh. Hi.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.640
MARI: Hi.
I'm Priya Kapoor.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.640
Yes, these are babies.
Congratulations.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.960
Twins. My husband tells me
I'm efficient at everything.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.320
Two babies, one pregnancy.
THEY CHUCKLE

07:52.320 --> 07:55.720
And yet, you're still working?
Tomorrow is my last day.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.400
It has been a discussion
with Jayesh. I won.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.640
Well, I hope you like it.
We have a plethora.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.480
I started the programme
a few years ago -

08:06.480 --> 08:09.480
inviting specialists
to see our local patients.

08:09.480 --> 08:12.720
Most people around here
get to see a doctor once a year,

08:12.720 --> 08:13.840
if they're lucky.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.880
Oh, here's Radhika.

08:15.880 --> 08:19.680
This is Sister Mari and Mr Hasan,
from The Good Karma Hospital.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.560
You'll be helping them today. OK?

08:22.840 --> 08:23.960
No problem.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.640
And cough for me.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.080
SHE SPEAKS LOCAL LANGUAGE

08:33.080 --> 08:34.480
HE COUGHS

08:36.640 --> 08:39.320
He has a small reducible
left inguinal hernia.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.880
We should book him to come and see
the visiting surgeon tomorrow

08:41.880 --> 08:44.200
and be assessed
for an elective repair. Yes, Doctor.

08:45.800 --> 08:49.920
So... you're handsome AND clever.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.080
If that's a question,
I'm not answering,

08:52.080 --> 08:54.040
but if that's a statement,
I won't disagree.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.240
MARI CLEARS THROAT
She understands.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.520
Shall we get the next patient in?

08:58.520 --> 09:00.360
Thank you, Sister.
Doctor?

09:00.360 --> 09:02.280
We need you urgently.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.560
PRIYA PANTING

09:07.560 --> 09:09.960
SHE GRUNTS
Contractions.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.440
How many weeks?
35, plus two.

09:12.440 --> 09:15.440
Ooh, they're early.
We need to get to the hospital!

09:17.920 --> 09:21.480
First pregnancy, right?
SHE GROANS

09:21.480 --> 09:23.240
That's a contraction.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.480
Anything before this? Braxton Hicks?

09:25.480 --> 09:26.800
Nothing.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.400
If they've only just started,
we still have a few hours.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.960
I can drive you to the hospital
myself. Come on. Thank you.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.840
My phone's just there.

09:35.840 --> 09:39.000
Argh! I need to call Jayesh,
explain what's happening.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.320
Keys?

09:42.880 --> 09:45.280
Guess I was just born lucky.
SHE CHUCKLES

09:46.960 --> 09:50.000
And he won't even consider it?
Point-blank refused.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.360
Even after I explained everything.
Remember his uncle?

09:53.360 --> 09:57.080
Diabetes and hypertension.
He was on dialysis for years.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.720
He had a tough time.

09:58.720 --> 10:03.000
You know, for a religious man,
Mr Ramesh is as stubborn as a mule.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.960
Everyone trusts in their own God,
but they still come to me for help.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.720
And you are but a minor deity
in the pantheon, Lydia.

10:09.720 --> 10:10.760
THEY CHUCKLE

10:10.760 --> 10:14.200
Anyway, give him some time.
You know, consider the consequences.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.680
I'm sure he'll come around.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.720
There's nothing for me in there,
is there?

10:17.720 --> 10:19.080
Only I'm waiting on something.

10:19.080 --> 10:23.280
Er... no, everything for me.
Why? Anything important?

10:23.280 --> 10:25.360
No. Nothing that can't wait.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.720
Something's wrong.
What do you mean?

10:38.720 --> 10:42.080
There's no gap
between the contractions and...

10:42.080 --> 10:46.480
I feel like I need to push, now!
You sure?

10:48.160 --> 10:51.680
And my water's just broken.
They're coming, they're coming now!

11:04.040 --> 11:07.480
How far from here?
Three, maybe four hours.

11:07.480 --> 11:11.160
They have neonatal facilities.
Nowhere else is even close.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.400
SHE GROANS

11:12.400 --> 11:14.080
The ashram is better than here.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.440
But your equipment there...?

11:15.440 --> 11:16.960
Just the basics.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.120
So what do we do?

11:19.120 --> 11:21.800
OK, we go back.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.080
Hang on.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.560
Please, come in.
Thank you.

11:32.560 --> 11:35.360
Dr Fonseca, how long will it
take you to start looking for

11:35.360 --> 11:37.520
a kidney match for Ramesh?
As soon as possible.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.000
These things take time.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.440
I have the answer! Donor exchange!

11:41.440 --> 11:45.160
One family in Punjab.
No compatibility between the family.

11:45.160 --> 11:48.640
One wife donated to the other.
There is another one here in Delhi.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.760
All it takes is a healthy person
to volunteer to donate,

11:51.760 --> 11:53.240
then they do the rest.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.600
And this healthy person
you're suggesting...?

11:56.600 --> 12:00.200
Moideen, you're over 60 years old!
But fit as a flea!

12:00.200 --> 12:03.240
Even so,
donating a kidney is no small thing.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.560
Neither is losing
your own best friend, Doctor.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.720
For the record,
this is done under protest.

12:18.240 --> 12:21.440
Ramesh is very lucky
to have a friend like you.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.160
Enlightened self-interest,
Doctor.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.520
Who will I humiliate in chess
if something happens to him?

12:27.520 --> 12:29.840
That's funny.
He tells me he always beats you.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.560
Sometimes I let him win.

12:32.560 --> 12:35.640
There. Bend. There we go. All done.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.160
KNOCKING

12:37.160 --> 12:38.360
There you are!

12:38.360 --> 12:41.720
He doesn't answer his phone,
the house is empty,

12:41.720 --> 12:43.400
then I find out
Ramesh Uncle is here.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.680
Bitter experience tells me
my father won't be very far away.

12:46.680 --> 12:50.040
So, what's going on?
Are you sick, Abu? Nothing.

12:50.040 --> 12:53.960
I just thought I'd get a routine
blood test done whilst I'm here.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.480
Dr Fonseca was kind enough
to oblige. Right, Doctor?

12:56.480 --> 12:58.040
After a fashion.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.600
But we're finished here.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.400
What is it, Abu?

13:04.160 --> 13:05.880
Are you sick? Tell me now.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.040
Dr Nair?

13:10.040 --> 13:12.160
I have the report
from Frankie Martin's scan.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.320
Oh, Miss Martin.

13:14.320 --> 13:18.200
Minor osteoporotic collapse,
nothing more.

13:18.200 --> 13:21.120
Good news, for a change.
Erm, I was going to call her,

13:21.120 --> 13:23.480
but I thought perhaps
I could go in person,

13:23.480 --> 13:26.000
with your permission?
Excellent idea.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.320
You know, we doctors
are always maligned

13:28.320 --> 13:30.200
to be the bearers of bad tidings,

13:30.200 --> 13:33.280
but we are allowed to spread
a little happiness sometimes...

13:33.280 --> 13:36.520
RAISED VOICES

13:36.520 --> 13:38.560
Don't be ridiculous...
I'm telling you!

13:38.560 --> 13:40.400
You're making a mistake.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.440
Anwar, this is my decision! Doctor,
he doesn't know what he's saying.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.640
I want you to give me those samples.
No! Don't you dare.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.840
Please give those tests to me now,
then we are leaving!

13:47.840 --> 13:50.000
Oh, really?
How are you going to make me leave?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.120
The boy who cries like a baby
every time the ball...

13:52.120 --> 13:54.760
Still he brings this up!
I demand you give me the samples!

13:54.760 --> 13:57.040
Enough! Both of you,
this is a hospital!

13:58.880 --> 14:00.080
Ah!

14:00.080 --> 14:01.120
Ooh!

14:02.240 --> 14:05.040
Doctor, I'm... I'm-I'm sorry.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.520
Aren't you ashamed?
Is this the way we brought you up?

14:07.520 --> 14:09.440
What the hell is going on here?

14:09.440 --> 14:12.120
It's nothing, I'm fine.
This idiot pushed her!

14:16.840 --> 14:18.920
Are you all right?
Yes.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.080
HORN HOOTS

14:27.440 --> 14:29.200
HOOTING CONTINUES

14:36.760 --> 14:39.160
Her waters broke in the car.
Precipitate labour. What?!

14:39.160 --> 14:41.280
We had no choice.
It was here or the side of the road!

14:41.280 --> 14:43.840
OK. Go get the back room cleared,
get everyone out,

14:43.840 --> 14:45.880
and call an ambulance
as quick as you can.

14:47.640 --> 14:49.080
SHE CRIES OUT

14:49.080 --> 14:51.880
I need to do a pelvic exam,
see how far along you are, OK?

14:55.520 --> 14:57.760
Fully dilated. She's moving fast.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.520
We'd never have made it.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.000
And word on that ambulance?
Just an hour, maybe more.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.200
OK.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.600
Let's see if I can remember
how to do this.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.800
SHE CRIES OUT IN PAIN
Priya!

15:10.800 --> 15:12.760
SHE YELLS
Priya?

15:12.760 --> 15:15.240
Your babies are on the way.
She needs you, OK?

15:15.240 --> 15:17.000
The baby's coming.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.160
OK. Push, one more time.
Push.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.160
Come on!

15:22.160 --> 15:23.680
OK.

15:24.680 --> 15:26.360
OK.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.640
She's hypoxic.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.800
Doctor?
OK...

15:35.800 --> 15:37.240
Doctor, what's going on?

15:37.240 --> 15:38.400
Doctor?

15:38.400 --> 15:40.400
What's wrong?

15:40.400 --> 15:42.520
It's OK. Just lay back.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.160
What's happening?

15:44.160 --> 15:46.800
We're just trying to help your baby
to breathe.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.080
Nothing.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.240
Darling, it's OK...

15:49.240 --> 15:51.120
No way are you doing this to me.
Come on.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.320
What's going on?

15:54.320 --> 15:55.960
BABY CRIES

15:55.960 --> 15:57.320
Oh!

15:57.320 --> 15:59.720
CRYING CONTINUES

16:04.520 --> 16:06.120
It's a girl.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.920
We have a daughter.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.920
Age-related vertebral collapse?

16:24.360 --> 16:27.480
I never thought I'd be so happy
to be told I'm falling apart.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.240
It's possible the treatment
you received

16:31.240 --> 16:33.400
made your bones more susceptible
to thinning.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.800
I can recommend some treatment...
But there's definitely no cancer?

16:36.800 --> 16:38.560
No cancer.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.760
And at five years from diagnosis,

16:40.760 --> 16:43.920
I think you can be quite confident
it's unlikely to return.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.120
Hey.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.480
It's OK.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.760
I'm OK.

17:07.760 --> 17:11.120
I mean, it seems
I'm a dried-up old hag

17:11.120 --> 17:13.360
whose bones are crumbling to dust,
but...

17:14.720 --> 17:16.520
..I'm all clear.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.520
So, what do you wanna do?
Swim? Walk?

17:22.520 --> 17:23.960
Show me some birds?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.040
Nothing.

17:26.440 --> 17:29.840
We should celebrate.
Dinner tonight, somewhere posh?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.720
I just wanna go home.

17:37.560 --> 17:38.800
'OK...'

17:38.800 --> 17:40.600
One down, one to go.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.320
There's a contraction,
but I can barely feel it.

17:44.320 --> 17:48.200
It's normal to slow a little.
Let's see where we are. Ready?

18:05.800 --> 18:07.400
It's OK, darling.

18:07.400 --> 18:11.560
I can't feel the baby's head.
I think she's breech. OK.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.480
The doctors know what they're doing.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.800
It's OK.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.280
The second twin
has turned in the womb.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.920
She's coming out,
but she's coming out backwards.

18:23.920 --> 18:27.080
So... what happens now?

18:39.960 --> 18:42.240
No. No fracture.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.840
You are indestructible.

18:48.680 --> 18:49.800
Ram...

18:51.560 --> 18:53.200
..I need your advice.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.120
I'm not a priest,

18:59.120 --> 19:02.680
but I can always hear a confession
when necessary.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.640
Jules and I...

19:06.880 --> 19:07.920
Oh...

19:10.040 --> 19:13.520
When he left,
there were certain formalities

19:13.520 --> 19:15.880
that I never
got around to dealing with.

19:17.440 --> 19:19.880
We're still married. Officially.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.640
It's just that I haven't
told anyone.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.120
So now you get a divorce.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.960
I mean, he can't refuse
after all these years?

19:26.960 --> 19:28.280
Oh, can't he?!

19:29.880 --> 19:33.040
I sent him some paperwork
to sign and send back,

19:33.040 --> 19:34.400
but he's not responding.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.320
And when I call, he's either out
or he won't pick up.

19:39.480 --> 19:42.560
What about Greg?
What does he have to say about this?

19:42.560 --> 19:46.720
I haven't told Greg anything
about what happened with Jules.

19:49.160 --> 19:53.520
You know, our greatest fears
are always in our mind.

19:53.520 --> 19:58.440
You face up to them,
and they're gone. Dust in the wind.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.800
My advice -

20:00.800 --> 20:05.080
go see Jules,
no matter what hold he's had on you.

20:05.080 --> 20:07.800
Cos you are not the same woman.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.400
Cos now I'm indestructible, right?

20:11.560 --> 20:12.880
You always were.

20:34.680 --> 20:35.720
Hey.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.960
You know,
your mum's had a rough time.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.360
She thought you'd be pleased.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.200
This is great news.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.360
If it's true.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.560
Or is it just another lie
you've made up to protect me?

20:55.560 --> 20:57.240
Absolutely not.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.000
Then show me the scan report.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.200
I can't. It's confidential.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.880
Not without
your mother's permission, anyway.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.080
No-one trusts me.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.520
Hey!

21:08.520 --> 21:10.880
You are the one
who got yourself arrested

21:10.880 --> 21:13.520
and ran away without telling anyone
where you were going!

21:13.520 --> 21:17.600
So what did you really expect?
Look, I can look after myself.

21:17.600 --> 21:21.000
Maybe, maybe not,
but if you want her to trust you,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.800
you have to start earning it.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.560
So what do I do?

21:33.120 --> 21:36.520
Well, your mother
wants to celebrate.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.600
So that's what we're going to do.

21:39.920 --> 21:40.960
Come on.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.640
Come on!

21:46.960 --> 21:49.680
This might be
a little uncomfortable.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.080
A little pressure.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.280
SHE GROANS

21:55.280 --> 21:56.320
It's OK.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.800
We're just trying
to roll her forwards.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.760
SHE YELLS

22:08.320 --> 22:10.360
So what now? Do we try again?

22:10.360 --> 22:11.480
Samir?

22:13.800 --> 22:15.440
Samir?

22:15.440 --> 22:17.520
SHE YELLS

22:17.520 --> 22:18.560
Big contraction.

22:21.760 --> 22:22.800
Baby's coming.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.720
You? A donor?

22:27.720 --> 22:30.320
You couldn't even spare a toenail!

22:30.320 --> 22:32.480
The whole idea is madness!

22:32.480 --> 22:35.400
And now your son
has been dragged into things.

22:35.400 --> 22:38.520
Moideen,
your blood results have come back.

22:38.520 --> 22:41.000
Now, this is just
a preliminary screening,

22:41.000 --> 22:45.040
but I'm afraid these tests
show evidence of early diabetes.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.920
Diabetes?

22:46.920 --> 22:48.920
Yeah, but as I say,
it's early and treatable.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.600
But what it does mean
is that you can't possibly donate

22:52.600 --> 22:55.280
a kidney for Ramesh,
or indeed anyone else.

22:55.280 --> 22:58.600
I'm really sorry, Moideen.
I know how much you wanted to help.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.320
So now you can end
this crazy fight with Anwar.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.000
No.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.080
I was willing to help my friend
because he was in need,

23:12.080 --> 23:14.560
but he thought only of himself.

23:16.160 --> 23:18.640
Fine sermons are all well and good,

23:18.640 --> 23:21.240
but a man reveals himself
through his actions.

23:21.240 --> 23:24.000
He may be a man of God...

23:24.000 --> 23:25.920
but he's no son of mine.

23:35.480 --> 23:38.920
OK. There you go. Ingredients.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.320
We need all of it.

23:40.320 --> 23:41.640
Aren't you coming with me?

23:41.640 --> 23:43.720
No. I'll just wait here.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.960
The rest is up to you.

23:45.960 --> 23:50.640
You said you could take care
of yourself, so let's see it.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.320
OK.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.000
SHE CRIES OUT

24:13.040 --> 24:15.680
OK, come on, push!

24:15.680 --> 24:17.840
Keep going, Priya.

24:17.840 --> 24:20.080
Footling breech. OK.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.160
We can do this. Keep pushing for me.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.400
Come on.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.840
There's the legs.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.160
And again. Push.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.800
SHE YELLS

24:27.800 --> 24:31.920
No, no, no.
The cord's prolapsing. Stop pushing.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.840
The baby's crushing the umbilical
cord. She's suffocating in there.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.400
We need her out now.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.200
Her arms are trapped.

24:38.200 --> 24:41.200
If we free her arms,
maybe she can deliver.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.880
Look, turn her like this.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.200
OK.
Now, sweep to free the arms.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.960
Right.
Now the other one.

24:49.040 --> 24:52.440
OK. Now push for me, Priya.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.320
Come on.

24:56.720 --> 24:57.760
She's tiring.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.280
Samir!

25:01.560 --> 25:05.600
Episiotomy. I need a knife,
scissors. Scissors!

25:11.960 --> 25:13.720
Clamps.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.560
Towels, now!

25:37.840 --> 25:38.960
Come on.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.760
INAUDIBLE

25:47.080 --> 25:51.560
COUNTING

25:57.280 --> 25:59.880
One, two, three, four,

25:59.880 --> 26:02.560
five, six, seven, eight.
Samir.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.600
Samir.

26:06.720 --> 26:10.280
Help me, help me...
OK, let me try.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.240
Doctor?

26:47.320 --> 26:51.040
Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un.

27:13.320 --> 27:15.280
I'm sorry.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.120
Thank you.

28:07.640 --> 28:11.280
HUBBUB

28:24.440 --> 28:26.720
Hey! Hey, Bobby!

28:29.080 --> 28:30.760
Bobby.

28:30.760 --> 28:32.000
Where the hell have you been?

28:32.000 --> 28:33.400
What?

28:33.400 --> 28:35.200
You said to get everything.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.760
I couldn't get galangal,

28:36.760 --> 28:39.040
but the lady said ginger
was an OK substitution,

28:39.040 --> 28:41.600
but I just thought
I'd check everywhere first...

28:41.600 --> 28:43.520
No, no, ginger's great.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.600
Come on, let's go.
She'll be starving to death.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.600
Come in.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.920
You'd better take a seat.

29:33.640 --> 29:39.360
You spend so much time trying to
make other parents feel... better.

29:40.920 --> 29:42.960
You tell them that you understand.

29:42.960 --> 29:46.320
But the truth is, you never do.

29:48.280 --> 29:50.440
Not until it happens to you.

30:01.640 --> 30:03.400
Tell me about her.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.160
I saw the way
you looked at Karishma.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.880
You have a father's eyes.

30:12.360 --> 30:17.480
And a man like you wouldn't leave
a child, if you had a choice.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.640
Tell me about her.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.040
I want you to.

30:35.640 --> 30:38.040
Her name was, erm...

30:38.040 --> 30:39.280
Jasmin.

30:40.680 --> 30:43.440
She was a... ball of energy.

30:43.440 --> 30:44.880
Crazy.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.320
Totally nuts.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.840
But then, she became quieter.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.720
Every day, a little more.

30:53.720 --> 30:56.160
And that wasn't her, you know?

30:56.160 --> 30:57.640
Something was wrong.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.320
It was a...

31:02.960 --> 31:04.880
..brain tumour.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.200
Ironic, right?

31:07.200 --> 31:11.000
I treat them every day,
talk to the parents, give them hope,

31:11.000 --> 31:13.160
and now it was me.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.600
My wife and I...

31:17.600 --> 31:21.520
The marriage didn't survive.
Lost my faith completely.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.240
Couldn't believe God would
take a child like that.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.880
I'm so sorry.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.600
Er... so...

31:42.240 --> 31:43.880
..you came here.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.280
No.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.440
I ran.

31:47.760 --> 31:52.840
I ran away from my career,
from my marriage,

31:52.840 --> 31:54.080
from God.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.320
From everything.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.800
SIRENS WAIL

32:01.800 --> 32:03.040
Here comes the cavalry.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.240
Not a moment too soon.

32:30.720 --> 32:32.320
This is my grandmother's recipe.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.640
Her dhal is legendary.

32:34.640 --> 32:35.800
Can't wait.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.920
So, what's in it?
Family secret!

32:38.920 --> 32:40.160
Ow!

32:40.160 --> 32:41.320
Ah!

32:41.320 --> 32:43.040
Ah! Ow!

32:44.200 --> 32:46.280
Are you OK?

32:46.280 --> 32:48.640
Ouch! Put some pressure on it.
What happened? Let me see.

32:48.640 --> 32:51.000
No, it's fine. You've cut yourself,
it could be serious.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.680
Let me see, please.
No, I'm OK, really!

32:52.680 --> 32:54.720
Come on, let me see.
Don't be stupid!

32:54.720 --> 32:57.080
I'm not stupid! I know, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

32:57.080 --> 32:59.920
I just wanna see. Or at least
let Niki look at it for you. No.

32:59.920 --> 33:02.840
I-I-I don't want to.
You're being ridiculous.

33:02.840 --> 33:04.840
Me? Mum, look at you!

33:04.840 --> 33:07.760
I'm 21 years old
and you're treating me like a baby.

33:07.760 --> 33:09.320
You, you're ruining all of this!

33:10.480 --> 33:11.840
Me?

33:11.840 --> 33:15.080
I came here for you.
Do you think I want to be here?

33:15.080 --> 33:18.280
This is all about you and
your bloody obsession with birds.

33:18.280 --> 33:21.000
Do you think that's why I came?
For the birds?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.920
Mum, this is about you!

33:24.040 --> 33:25.960
You're the one without any life,
not me!

33:25.960 --> 33:27.760
You don't even have any friends.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.240
That's rubbish.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.960
I have 6,527 Instagram followers.
What do you have?

33:32.960 --> 33:34.840
I thought we were talking about
real people.

33:34.840 --> 33:37.560
They are real people.

33:37.560 --> 33:39.320
You know, I'm a real person.

33:39.320 --> 33:43.000
God, why does everyone think
I'm the one with the problem here?

33:45.080 --> 33:49.880
I-I-I don't want this, not any more.

33:49.880 --> 33:53.840
I don't want this
and I don't want you, OK?

34:37.920 --> 34:39.720
Oh!

34:48.840 --> 34:50.560
Is that it, eh?

34:50.560 --> 34:53.000
You're just gonna hit me
and walk away?

34:53.000 --> 34:55.840
You're the expert
at leaving without saying a word.

34:55.840 --> 34:57.240
Wait, wait.

34:57.240 --> 34:59.280
Mari, please, wait!

35:03.000 --> 35:04.280
How is she?

35:04.280 --> 35:06.920
Ruby... is over it.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.480
Over you.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.320
She's basically over everything.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.640
Oh, my God.

35:14.640 --> 35:17.800
Did you think she'd be here?
Is that why you came?

35:17.800 --> 35:20.920
Dr Kapoor asked me
to run a surgical outreach... Liar!

35:22.080 --> 35:24.120
You came looking for her here!

35:24.120 --> 35:26.920
Well, she's gone.
So much for that plan, eh?

35:26.920 --> 35:29.840
Hey. Everything OK?

35:29.840 --> 35:33.640
Mr Hasan, meet Dr Varma.

35:33.640 --> 35:36.200
I think he might need stitches.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.960
Someone just punched him
in the face.

35:45.360 --> 35:49.400
A month ago, a mob chased me
after I left the mosque.

35:52.960 --> 35:55.800
For no reason, other than my faith.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.080
I barely escaped.

35:59.080 --> 36:03.640
In this country,
Muslims and Hindus are in conflict.

36:03.640 --> 36:07.040
The slightest disagreement
can lead to terrible violence.

36:07.040 --> 36:10.680
What if this thing goes wrong,
if Ramesh Uncle dies?

36:10.680 --> 36:13.520
If my father
doesn't survive the procedure?

36:13.520 --> 36:16.400
A Muslim man dies to save a Hindu?

36:17.400 --> 36:21.440
Moideen isn't a suitable donor.
I never thought he would be.

36:26.320 --> 36:28.360
Doctor, I was frightened.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.920
But that is no excuse
for my behaviour, and...

36:32.520 --> 36:36.080
..you have my sincerest apologies.
It was inexcusable.

36:37.640 --> 36:40.080
I was going to say
that I understand,

36:40.080 --> 36:42.280
but perhaps that's impossible.

36:42.280 --> 36:47.320
You seem to fear the worst in
people, and-and maybe that's right.

36:47.320 --> 36:50.160
Whereas in all the years
of doing this job,

36:50.160 --> 36:53.040
I have had the privilege
of seeing them

36:53.040 --> 36:56.160
at almost nothing but their best.

36:57.320 --> 37:02.080
Your father and Ramesh
have the strongest,

37:02.080 --> 37:05.240
most loving friendship
I've ever seen.

37:05.240 --> 37:08.840
He just needs to know that he's
tried everything to help his friend.

37:11.360 --> 37:14.320
You know, the son-in-law of
Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,

37:14.320 --> 37:15.480
he, er...

37:17.160 --> 37:19.600
He once said that two true friends

37:19.600 --> 37:23.600
are a single soul
in different bodies.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.880
It is true that without a donor,
Ramesh Uncle, he will die?

37:32.360 --> 37:33.600
Yes, I'm afraid so.

37:34.680 --> 37:37.120
So... what happens now?

37:38.520 --> 37:42.320
Well, I've done all I can.
The rest is up to him.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.880
Any loose teeth? Bite OK?

37:49.880 --> 37:51.200
It's fine.

37:52.320 --> 37:55.760
The lac's just superficial.
No stitches. Give me a minute?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.160
So, did you deserve it?

38:02.120 --> 38:03.520
Probably, yes.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.560
Ruby's ex, right?

38:07.080 --> 38:08.920
Yes, we...

38:08.920 --> 38:11.800
We went our separate ways.
Some faster than others?

38:11.800 --> 38:13.400
You pick up things.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.480
This might..
OK, OK.

38:17.480 --> 38:18.920
..sting a little.
Just go on. OK.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.840
Mari said that, er, Ruby left?

38:28.080 --> 38:30.600
Compassionate leave.
Her dad's sick.

38:30.600 --> 38:34.520
She's gone to see him. At a hospice.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.080
I'm sorry.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.160
Sorry you got in the middle of that.

38:54.160 --> 38:56.080
He'll calm down.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.240
This, it...

38:58.440 --> 38:59.960
..it's a nice idea.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.560
You don't have to do that.

39:03.560 --> 39:05.040
I don't mind.
No, it's fine!

39:06.680 --> 39:09.560
Please, can you just leave?

39:12.400 --> 39:13.800
Sure.

39:19.800 --> 39:21.800
SHE EXHALES DEEPLY

39:26.080 --> 39:31.080
You know, I always thought
that being a doctor would be easy.

39:31.080 --> 39:37.120
Well, not easy, but I just thought
I would work so hard

39:37.120 --> 39:39.440
and learn absolutely everything,

39:39.440 --> 39:43.040
and then I would know
exactly what to do and...

39:43.040 --> 39:44.400
help people.

39:46.280 --> 39:47.960
But that's not how it is.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.720
No matter how much you learn,
how much you know,

39:50.720 --> 39:53.520
you realise that someone
could still get hurt.

39:53.520 --> 39:54.840
Someone could still get sick

39:54.840 --> 39:58.640
and somebody that trusted you
could still die.

39:58.640 --> 40:00.040
And that's hard,

40:00.040 --> 40:04.160
but if you want to do the job, you
have to learn to live with the fear.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.800
So that's what I'm doing.
Living with it.

40:08.440 --> 40:09.880
I'm not a mother.

40:11.080 --> 40:13.640
But I think
maybe it's a similar thing?

40:16.200 --> 40:21.640
But, obviously, I'm not a mother,
so I'm sorry if I got this wrong.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.640
I just tried to help.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.400
Hey...

40:50.400 --> 40:52.120
erm...

40:52.120 --> 40:54.920
what I told you, erm...

40:54.920 --> 40:57.360
I don't want everyone to know.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.600
It's not why I'm here.

41:01.800 --> 41:03.200
They'd understand.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.040
I know. Erm...

41:06.880 --> 41:09.240
I'm just not sure
I'm ready for that.

41:09.240 --> 41:11.440
Then it stays between us.

41:27.200 --> 41:30.080
Doctor Fonseca! Erm...

41:30.080 --> 41:33.200
I'd like you to test me
for the donor exchange program.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.480
For Ramesh Uncle.

41:36.480 --> 41:38.360
Then you'd better come in.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.720
I managed to change the flights.

41:56.720 --> 41:59.040
We're leaving tomorrow.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.720
Well?

42:11.720 --> 42:12.960
What is this?

42:12.960 --> 42:16.800
Well, it's small,
but it looks clean and decent,

42:16.800 --> 42:20.000
and it's only three streets away
from ours. I mean...

42:21.400 --> 42:22.800
..mine.

42:22.800 --> 42:25.440
I'm saying you can move out.

42:25.440 --> 42:26.800
If you want to.

42:54.360 --> 42:58.840
SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE

43:12.960 --> 43:18.800
My only son is giving away
a very vital organ,

43:18.800 --> 43:21.600
so you please stop your nonsense,
yes?

43:21.600 --> 43:25.120
Can anyone else hear an annoying fly
buzzing in this room?

43:25.120 --> 43:26.720
CHUCKLES

43:42.600 --> 43:45.920
You really have no idea
how hard this is gonna be.

43:48.640 --> 43:50.440
Actually, maybe you do.

43:50.440 --> 43:53.720
I'm curious. Why did you help me?
It's my job.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.880
Or at least, I think it's my job.

43:55.880 --> 44:01.320
You know, my dad told me
I needed some real life.

44:01.320 --> 44:02.960
FRANKIE LAUGHS

44:02.960 --> 44:05.200
I see. And that's us?
Yeah.

44:05.200 --> 44:09.160
I mean, no, not like that, but...

44:09.160 --> 44:10.600
Yeah.

44:10.600 --> 44:12.440
Thank you.

44:12.440 --> 44:15.720
I think you are a wonderful doctor.

44:15.720 --> 44:18.920
Your dad should be
very proud of you.

44:20.840 --> 44:23.640
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

44:23.640 --> 44:28.400
Now all I need you to do is
find him a wife before we leave.

44:29.800 --> 44:31.200
Oh, I don't think...

44:33.880 --> 44:35.680
You're teasing me, aren't you?

44:36.680 --> 44:38.600
Hell, yeah.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.440
That seems to have worked out OK.

44:47.440 --> 44:50.640
They say God works
in mysterious ways,

44:50.640 --> 44:53.200
but it appears Vishnu
is even sneakier.

44:54.320 --> 44:56.920
Always been a Ganesh fan myself.

44:56.920 --> 45:00.200
When Shiva lumbers you with six arms
and an elephant head,

45:00.200 --> 45:02.560
you need to develop
a thick skin pretty quickly.

45:02.560 --> 45:07.000
Yes! Ganesh - number one god,
hands down, no returns.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.800
Listen.

45:10.800 --> 45:13.560
I'm gonna need to go and see him.
Jules.

45:13.560 --> 45:16.880
Get him to sign this bloody
financial order and finish it.

45:16.880 --> 45:19.920
I think it's the only way.
You want me to come, too?

45:21.120 --> 45:24.360
No. No, I reckon
I need to do this alone.

45:24.360 --> 45:27.600
Then may your favourite god
go with you.

45:31.160 --> 45:32.840
Yes, what can I get for you?

45:32.840 --> 45:34.240
Two beers, please.

45:34.240 --> 45:36.960
Two beers coming right up.
Freezing cold.

46:06.920 --> 46:09.120
