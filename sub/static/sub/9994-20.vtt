00:02.200 --> 00:05.300
WOMAN:
Oh, my God, you're
gambling again.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.700
Hey, I'm talking
to you!

00:08.700 --> 00:09.900
Yeah, yeah, I know, babe.

00:09.900 --> 00:12.100
If you could just
hold that thought till the end
of this quarter.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.400
You want to put
that back on?

00:21.400 --> 00:23.900
No, I don't.

00:24.100 --> 00:25.500
In case you've forgotten,

00:25.500 --> 00:28.100
it's my money that's
paying for this room,

00:28.900 --> 00:32.299
just like it's going
to be my money that covers your bad bet.

00:33.300 --> 00:36.300
Fine.
Message delivered.

00:36.700 --> 00:39.000
It's your money we play
with in this marriage.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.900
You're the one with
the trust fund.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.300
Now put the
set back on.

00:43.800 --> 00:46.000
You know, Walt,
it's times like these

00:46.000 --> 00:48.900
I thank God
my mother made me get a prenup.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
What?

00:52.400 --> 00:54.300
You going to hit me?

00:54.500 --> 00:56.200
Go ahead.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.600
Make all this even easier.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.600
Hit you?

00:59.600 --> 01:01.100
Are you kidding?

01:01.300 --> 01:03.200
I wish you were dead.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

01:34.500 --> 01:38.500
Walt?

01:53.700 --> 01:55.200
Natalie Paxton?

01:56.800 --> 01:57.800
How did you know?

01:57.800 --> 01:59.100
'Cause you grabbed
your neck.

01:59.100 --> 02:00.200
You always
grab your neck

02:00.200 --> 02:02.400
when you're dreaming
about Natalie Paxton.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.100
I guess I
do, don't I?

02:04.600 --> 02:07.900
Oh, well, those dreams
can't go on much longer.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.600
Tomorrow's closing
arguments, right?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.700
So it seems pretty clear
that jury's gonna 

02:13.700 --> 02:16.200
send her husband
away forever.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.900
Let's hope so.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.100
And the only thing I
don't get is how

02:21.100 --> 02:23.900
after having the same dream
over and over again,

02:23.900 --> 02:26.100
it still manages
to scare you.

02:26.800 --> 02:27.400
I don't know.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.200
The whole thing
is so morbid.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.300
The guy kills
his wife.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.700
He chops off
her head.

02:32.700 --> 02:36.000
And then takes it,
puts it somewhere.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.100
Hides it somewhere.

02:37.100 --> 02:40.100
But, honey, you've dreamt
this dream how many times now?

02:40.600 --> 02:41.600
I mean, after a while,

02:41.600 --> 02:44.700
don't you start
to get a little... desensitized?

02:44.800 --> 02:46.700
No, I don't.
Not even a little.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.700
Personally,
I'm starting to think

02:48.700 --> 02:51.300
it might be time
to have a conversation with the late Mrs. Paxton.

02:51.300 --> 02:54.200
Explain to her
there may be other dead people

02:54.200 --> 02:55.400
who need your help,

02:55.600 --> 02:57.800
and she can't be monopolizing
your dreamtime like this.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.300
Yeah? Well, next time
I see her, I'll tell her.

03:00.300 --> 03:06.200
Right after I ask her where her loving husband
stashed her head.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.200
Allison!

03:12.200 --> 03:14.100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.500
It was Natalie.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.800
Paxton. Got it.

03:18.400 --> 03:28.400

04:04.500 --> 04:06.400
Girls, come on!

04:06.400 --> 04:08.400
I've got cereal
getting soggy in here!

04:11.100 --> 04:12.700
Sweetie, what is it?
What's wrong?

04:15.200 --> 04:16.200
Are you hurt?

04:17.000 --> 04:17.899
Well, I don't
understand.

04:17.899 --> 04:18.700
Why aren't
you talking?

04:18.700 --> 04:20.000
She can't talk.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.200
She's not allowed.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.900
Not allowed?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.100
She's jinxed!

04:25.200 --> 04:27.400
Okay, Ariel, why don't you
tell me what's going on here?

04:27.400 --> 04:29.500
Well, Marie sneezed
this morning 

04:29.500 --> 04:32.000
and that person over there and I
both said "bless you,"

04:32.000 --> 04:33.900
so I jinxed her.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.300
And now she can't speak
until someone says her name,

04:37.300 --> 04:39.300
or she'll have bad luck
for the rest of her life.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.600
You're kidding. I remember this
from when I was a girl.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.600
Honey, it's okay.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.800
It's just a game.
It's not true.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Yes, it is.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.600
And it's not a game.

04:48.700 --> 04:51.700
It's a curse
that's been around for thousands of years.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.900
Don't do it, Mom,
or you'll have bad luck for the
rest of your life.

04:58.600 --> 04:59.500
Bridgette.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.400
Bridgette, Bridgette, Bridgette.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.600
Thank you!

05:03.600 --> 05:07.100
I thought I wouldn't
ever be able to talk again!

05:07.300 --> 05:09.100
Oh, no, that'd
be awful.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.300
Okay, guys, come on,
finish your cereal.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.600
I gotta go talk to Daddy.

05:18.700 --> 05:19.700
Hey.

05:20.900 --> 05:21.600
Help me out here.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.800
Which, which one
of these shirts looks the most
well-adjusted?

05:27.400 --> 05:31.400
Well, I say the...
the one on the left looks,

05:31.600 --> 05:33.400
 uh, a little
paranoid to me.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.900
And the one on the right looks
like it has anger issues.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.900
Pretty excited about going
to the therapist, huh?

05:40.900 --> 05:42.500
Oh, yeah. Huh?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.700
Well, you want some company?

05:48.200 --> 05:50.300
Going to the company-
ordered shrink?

05:50.400 --> 05:51.600
Well, yeah, I could drive you.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.100
You know, wait with you.

05:53.100 --> 05:55.500
Who knows? Maybe he'll even
let me come in with you.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.700
Al, I can do this.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.800
I appreciate the offer,
but I can do this.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.600
No. I know you can.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.100
You're worried
about me. I get it.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.700
And I appreciate it, but
I'll be fine. I <i>am</i> fine.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.000
You know, I think
they're right.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.500
Maybe I went back
to work too soon,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.600
so if they want me to go
talk to this guy, 
I'm happy to go talk to this guy.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.200
Besides, isn't today
closing arguments?

06:18.200 --> 06:20.200
It's not like I'm
actually in the courtroom.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.200
Devalos just likes to have me
around the office,

06:22.200 --> 06:25.000
just hanging around
in case he needs something.

06:25.700 --> 06:28.000
Trust me, he won't
even notice if I'm not there.

06:28.000 --> 06:28.900
It's okay.

06:29.500 --> 06:30.900
Be there. I'll be fine.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.400
DEVALOS:
 <i>What does</i>
 <i>"circumstantial" mean?</i>

06:34.800 --> 06:38.800
The defense will try to attack the people's case
as "circumstantial."

06:38.800 --> 06:41.400
They want you to assume

06:41.400 --> 06:44.700
that "circumstantial" and "not
guilty" are one and the same.

06:44.700 --> 06:46.400
They are not. You know this.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.600
Your common sense
will tell you this--

06:49.600 --> 06:53.100
your common sense
in combination with the testimony you've
heard in this courtroom.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.400
So let's review that testimony.

06:55.900 --> 06:58.300
You've heard
from Walter Paxton's bookies

06:58.300 --> 06:58.900
and business associates.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.600
They've testified to his lies,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.100
his history
of stealing from his wife

07:04.100 --> 07:06.400
and his escalating
gambling debts.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.800
You've heard from Natalie
Paxton's accountants,

07:08.800 --> 07:11.400
how they had recently
informed Mr. Paxton

07:11.400 --> 07:13.300
that he was about to be cut off.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.200
You've heard from a number of
matrimonial 

07:16.200 --> 07:19.200
and family attorneys testifying
to the iron-clad nature

07:19.200 --> 07:22.800
of Walter and his late wife's
prenuptial agreement,

07:22.800 --> 07:24.600
how anything other
than his wife's death

07:24.600 --> 07:28.100
would leave him broke and
in debt to violent criminals.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.500
And you've heard
a proprietor of a knife shop say

07:30.500 --> 07:32.500
that the defendant
purchased a blade

07:32.500 --> 07:35.500
that matches the incisions
on Natalie Paxton's body--

07:35.500 --> 07:41.100
a knife that he cannot or
will not produce for this court.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.300
You've heard about
the night of the killing.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.700
The screaming fight
in the hotel room.

07:46.700 --> 07:50.000
The defendant seen leaving
the lobby carrying a satchel.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.800
The three subsequent hours for which the defendant
cannot account,

07:54.800 --> 07:58.200
hours spent, he claims,
driving the streets in anger.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.100
And it was during those hours,

08:01.100 --> 08:03.100
that the defendant,
Walter Paxton,

08:03.100 --> 08:06.100
would have you believe
that someone else

08:06.700 --> 08:10.700
entered his hotel room,
someone else using Walter Paxton's key card,

08:11.400 --> 08:15.100
Someone else with a knife
exactly like Walter Paxton's.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.400
And once inside,

08:16.400 --> 08:18.500
what did this someone else do?

08:18.800 --> 08:22.200
Why, he decapitated Walter's
Paxton's wife, of course,

08:22.200 --> 08:24.600
and kept her head as a souvenir!

08:26.700 --> 08:28.100
JUDGE:
Please, folks.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.400
So what do we think?

08:30.500 --> 08:32.000
I'd rather have a
knife or some DNA

08:32.000 --> 08:33.700
or a fingerprint,
but failing that...

08:33.700 --> 08:36.299
you were pretty
damn magnificent.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.299
Ah. Terrific.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.200
No, I'm here.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.100
I'm not going anywhere.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.400
Maybe just grab
a sandwich or something.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.000
Okay.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.400
See you then.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.400
Can I help you?

08:49.400 --> 08:51.400
Yeah, I, um, I'm,
so sorry to bother you.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.900
Do you happen to own a beige-colored
Volvo station wagon?

08:55.000 --> 08:58.200
Parked on the ground floor of
the municipal garage out here?

08:58.800 --> 08:59.700
WOMAN:
 <i>I feel terrible.</i>

08:59.700 --> 09:02.200

 <i>I was in a rush because I got</i> a message from
the DMV saying

09:02.200 --> 09:03.600
they were gonna
take away my license

09:03.600 --> 09:04.800
if I didn't pay my
parking tickets and

09:04.800 --> 09:07.200
I guess I didn't realize
how many I'd racked up

09:07.200 --> 09:10.100
and how long they've been
unpaid for, 'cause, well,

09:10.100 --> 09:12.300
I can't really do my job
without being able to drive.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.900
So anyway, I was pulling in
and I must've misjudged

09:14.900 --> 09:17.400
where your car was
because... smack.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.300
You're being really nice
about this. Most people...

09:20.300 --> 09:22.300
Well, most people wouldn't
be quite so nice.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.800
Oh, I think you
have it backwards.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.700
Most people wouldn't
come looking for me.

09:25.900 --> 09:28.100
Most people wouldn't bother
to put a note on the car.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.400
Really? You think?

09:36.300 --> 09:38.200
You can't even
see it, can you?

09:39.900 --> 09:40.900
See?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.300
Smack.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.500
That? I wouldn't even
have noticed it

09:44.500 --> 09:45.500
if you didn't point it out.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.700
This car's not
in pristine condition.

09:47.900 --> 09:50.800
Well, all the same,
here is my information.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.900
Get an estimate and
I'll pay to have it fixed.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.700
Pay to have what fixed?

09:54.800 --> 09:55.500
You know what?

09:55.500 --> 09:56.700
Are you married?

09:57.400 --> 09:59.400
You're married-- get your
husband to look at it.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.100
If you do decide
to get it fixed,

10:01.100 --> 10:02.700
then you've got
my name and number.

10:02.700 --> 10:05.700
Well, you <i>are</i> sweet but this
is completely unnecessary.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.000
Okay. Well, um...

10:08.600 --> 10:10.000
How about lunch then?

10:10.000 --> 10:10.900
Excuse me?

10:10.900 --> 10:14.700
Well, now I think that you think that I'm a nut or something.

10:14.700 --> 10:17.000
I've bothered you,
I've wasted your time.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.800
At least let me buy you lunch.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.700
I don't think you're a nut,

10:20.700 --> 10:23.200
but, honestly, uh, we're
in the middle of a trial.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.700
My boss is kind
of counting on me to be in the office.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.100
Well, how about tomorrow, then?

10:27.100 --> 10:28.600
It'd make me feel better.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.900
All right. You know what?

10:32.900 --> 10:34.200
Forget that. The truth is,

10:34.200 --> 10:36.500
it's completely
selfish on my part.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.000
I'm here for a couple of weeks.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.800
I don't know that many people.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.500
You seem nice.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.300
Well, the thing is...

10:45.600 --> 10:48.000
I don't really know what
tomorrow's gonna hold.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.100
Doesn't matter. I'll call you.

10:52.300 --> 10:53.400
Okay, you win!

10:53.400 --> 10:55.500
You're a nut!
I am!

10:55.500 --> 10:57.000
You hear that?
That's your phone ringing.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
That's me calling you right now.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.500
It was nice meeting
you, uh, Debra.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.800
(quietly):
I think.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.200
Lunch tomorrow. It's a date.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.500
So what are you
so angry about?

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
It can't just be
coming here to see me.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.300
Who said I'm angry?

11:18.600 --> 11:19.800
Are you kidding?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.600
It's pouring off you.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.200
You're a walking
billboard for anger.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.700
No, I think you're wrong. I don't think I'm angry.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.600
A little depressed, maybe.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.600
I saw two coworkers
get shot and killed.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.400
Call me crazy,
but I think that gives me the right
to be a little down.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.600
Okay.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.500
We'll... play it
your way-- depressed.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.500
By the way, do you know
what depression is?

11:45.900 --> 11:48.800
Why? Aren't you
allowed to have it even if you can't
describe it?

11:48.900 --> 11:50.800
No, I don't know
what it is.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.800
I just know what
it feels like.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.300
Well, let me tell you
about it, then.

11:55.900 --> 11:59.600
In men, it's often a function
of un-channeled anger.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.900
A sense of despair,
helplessness,

12:01.900 --> 12:06.600
brought on by... situations
completely beyond our control.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.300
You go to work.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.100
You like going to work;
it fulfills you.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.700
You support your family,

12:12.900 --> 12:15.400
hold up that end of the bargain
you have with society--

12:15.600 --> 12:18.500
as a father, as a husband,
as a contributor,

12:18.800 --> 12:20.300
as a breadwinner.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.400
Work is safe-- you know
what's expected of you,

12:22.400 --> 12:24.200
and for the most part,
you can deliver.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.800
And then, one day,
someone shows up with a gun,

12:27.100 --> 12:29.100
and all the rules change.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.600
Not going to work
means, possibly,

12:32.600 --> 12:34.800
potentially putting
your life on the line.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.900
A person has a right
to get mad about that.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
About the deal
changing like that.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.000
Thank you both
for making time.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.700
It's all right--
everyone's pretty much gone.

13:16.700 --> 13:17.400
Please.

13:18.700 --> 13:22.500
That was, uh, quite
a closing argument.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.400
I agree-- so shouldn't you
be home preparing yours?

13:26.900 --> 13:28.600
What can we do for you,
counselor?

13:29.400 --> 13:31.900
Given the events of the day,
I'd be willing to try

13:31.900 --> 13:34.900
and convince my client that
it might be to his advantage

13:34.900 --> 13:37.300
to accept a plea
of murder two.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.700
I'd be looking for 25 years
with time served,

13:39.700 --> 13:43.700
and a guarantee that my
client would be eligible
for parole in 12 years.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.900
Think about it.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.700
Get back to me.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.200
The man chopped
his wife's head off.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.600
It's a bird in the hand,
Manuel-- take it,

14:05.600 --> 14:07.200
and tomorrow morning
it's over.

14:07.200 --> 14:10.200
He's behind bars,
and you're all over the news as
a winning D.A.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.000
You know what?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.200
You amaze me--
not two minutes ago,

14:13.200 --> 14:16.800
you were sitting there
talking about what a powerful and stirirring
closing argument it was.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.300
And it was, but the case
is circumstantial.

14:20.900 --> 14:24.100
I can't be certain he did it,
and neither can you.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.900
And I just worry that when that
jury gets behind closed doors,

14:27.300 --> 14:29.900
they just might say the
same thing to themselves.

14:33.600 --> 14:37.200
It's a trial, Manuel--
anything can happen.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.800
Let me know
what you decide.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.200
I will call you

14:52.200 --> 14:54.200
when I've reached a decision!

14:55.400 --> 14:57.300
She wants to make a deal,
doesn't she?

14:58.500 --> 15:00.500
Alison, I'm sorry,
I thought you were...

15:00.900 --> 15:02.300
What did she offer?

15:03.800 --> 15:04.900
(sighs):
Murder two.

15:05.200 --> 15:09.200
25 years, eligibility
for parole in 12.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.100
The truth is,
I should take it--

15:12.100 --> 15:13.700
the case <i>is</i> circumstantial.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.300
The jury'll get
hung up again,

15:15.300 --> 15:17.400
and then we'll be
right back where we started.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.600
Maybe it doesn't matter.

15:21.300 --> 15:24.200
I dream the same
dream every night,

15:24.200 --> 15:26.500
and there is nothing
circumstantial about it.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.500
There's nothing
equivocal about it.

15:28.900 --> 15:31.900
He sneaks up behind her
like a coward.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.200
You should see his face--

15:33.200 --> 15:35.500
the smug pleasure
he takes in it.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.200
Her life is gone!

15:37.200 --> 15:39.900
I'm not just talking about
the years ahead of her,

15:39.900 --> 15:42.600
I'm talking about the ones
she already lived.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.700
Everything that she did,
everything she accomplished,

15:45.700 --> 15:49.400
it's all reduced to:
"She's the woman who
got her head cut off."

15:49.600 --> 15:51.800
And he's gonna get 12 years?

15:51.900 --> 15:53.800
That's not justice!

15:53.800 --> 15:57.300
That's some kind of
perverse expedience!

16:01.100 --> 16:02.800
Well, don't worry about it.

16:05.900 --> 16:07.800
We're not gonna do
expedience today.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.500
We're gonna finish
trying this case.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.300
We're gonna trust the jury.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.400
Good

16:15.700 --> 16:17.300
What, that's it?
That's it.

16:17.500 --> 16:20.000
But that's nothing--
that's <i>less</i> than nothing.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.600
I know-- that's what <i>I</i> thought.

16:22.700 --> 16:23.600
So, what do you think--

16:23.600 --> 16:25.700
do I even bother
getting an estimate?

16:26.400 --> 16:28.000
For a ding that small?

16:28.800 --> 16:30.800
Yeah, you're right,
it's crazy.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.400
She wants to have lunch.

16:36.900 --> 16:38.200
I'm sorry. Who's that?

16:38.500 --> 16:41.200
The woman who hit my car;
she wants to have lunch.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.700
I might do it, too.

16:42.900 --> 16:46.700
Mm. Pretty risky--
eating...

16:46.700 --> 16:48.000
with another person...

16:48.600 --> 16:49.800
in public.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.700
Don't joke.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.200
It's hard for me.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.200
I don't have many friends.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.000
When I meet people--
I can't explain it--

16:58.700 --> 17:02.300
I don't know,
I immediately know too much.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.900
Makes it hard.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.200
So, what is it about
this one, then?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.599
She was nice.

17:08.900 --> 17:11.700
It was nice of her to come
and find me, and she was funny.

17:11.700 --> 17:14.099
Besides, she's only in town
for a couple of weeks,

17:14.099 --> 17:17.000
so if I start sensing things
that I don't like, I...

17:29.100 --> 17:31.500
So, how was therapy?
How was the therapist?

17:31.500 --> 17:33.200
Oh, he said I was angry.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.100
Oh, yeah?
What did you make of that?

17:35.700 --> 17:37.400
It pissed me off.

17:37.700 --> 17:40.300
  BAILIFF:
 <i>All rise</i> for the Honorable
Judge Arthur Brock.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.100
This Criminal Court
of Mariposa County
is now in session,

17:43.100 --> 17:45.300
the Honorable
Judge Arthur Brock presiding.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.100
You may be seated.

17:51.300 --> 17:54.600
The court will now continue
to hear closing ar...

17:56.800 --> 17:58.600
The defendant may be seated.

17:58.900 --> 18:00.700
Your Honor,
may I address the bench?

18:00.700 --> 18:01.600
Walter, what are you...

18:01.600 --> 18:03.300
Counsel, what is
your client doing?

18:03.300 --> 18:05.700
I wish to dismiss my attorney,
Your Honor.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.000
Walter, sit down!

18:07.000 --> 18:08.100
Excuse me?

18:08.100 --> 18:10.700
Your Honor,
it has just come to my attention

18:10.700 --> 18:13.700
that my counsel
attempted to make a deal with
the prosecution.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.000
She did this
behind my back

18:16.000 --> 18:18.600
(crowd murmuring)
to put me in prison
for 25 years!

18:18.800 --> 18:19.600
JUDGE:
All right...

18:20.100 --> 18:22.400
all right,
everybody settle down.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.100
Your Honor, this is clearly
a cheap theatrical stunt

18:25.100 --> 18:26.300
to sway the jury's
sympathies.

18:26.300 --> 18:30.300
Mr. Paxton, counsels,
approach the bench, please, <i>now.</i>

18:35.900 --> 18:38.200
Your Honor, I don't know what...
Your Honor,
this is not a ploy-- 

18:38.200 --> 18:40.200
I just found
out about this deal
four minutes ago,

18:40.200 --> 18:42.100
and now I'm supposed to
let her speak for me?

18:42.200 --> 18:44.200
Mr. Paxton, let me save you
a lot of grief and time.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.800
This is a boneheaded move;

18:45.800 --> 18:47.700
you're facing the death penalty.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.900
Your best strategy right now
is to walk back to that chair

18:49.900 --> 18:51.300
with your tail between your legs

18:51.300 --> 18:52.700
and let your counsel
do her work.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.500
When she's already
tried to put me away?

18:54.500 --> 18:57.700
YourHonor,I'm entitled to
the best defense available,

18:57.700 --> 19:00.300
and right now I believe
I should speak for myself,

19:00.300 --> 19:01.700
since I seem to be
the only one here

19:01.700 --> 19:03.300
who believes
in my innoce...
JUDGE:

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Did you try to cut a deal?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.200
Of course I did, Your Honor--
it's my job

19:08.200 --> 19:11.300
to present my client with all
the options available to him.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.400
And you explained this
to your client?
Yes, I did.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.200
Mr. Devalos?

19:16.400 --> 19:20.200
If the defendant wishes to make
his own closing argument,I have no objections,
Your Honor.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.100
You know why he has
no objection?

19:23.600 --> 19:25.800
Because you're handing him
the verdict.

19:26.300 --> 19:29.100
Maybe. Maybe not.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.200
Joe.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.200
PAXTON:
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

20:08.200 --> 20:10.600
I am not an innocent man.

20:11.700 --> 20:15.700
I broke the vows that I made
before God to my wife.

20:16.500 --> 20:19.000
I lied, I stole,

20:20.100 --> 20:23.900
I gave my wife every reason
to cut me off

20:23.900 --> 20:25.700
and to leave our marriage.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.300
But that is a...

20:29.100 --> 20:32.900
far cry from
the almost unimaginable thing

20:32.900 --> 20:34.900
that I am accused of today.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
I mean, ask yourselves,

20:38.500 --> 20:42.500
what would it take for you to do
to another human being

20:42.600 --> 20:45.500
what they accuse me of doing

20:47.000 --> 20:47.800
Now,

20:48.100 --> 20:53.400
it's true, they've proven
that I fought with my wife.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.000
They've even proven that,
on occasion,

20:57.000 --> 20:58.400
full of emotion,

20:59.300 --> 21:01.100
I've said things I don't mean,

21:01.500 --> 21:03.700
even wished for my wife's death.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.300
But who amongst us hadn't had

21:07.300 --> 21:10.700
an embarrassing public lapse
in judgment?

21:10.900 --> 21:14.800
Or an emotional exchange
so filled with poison

21:14.800 --> 21:17.300
that you prayed to God
you could take it back.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.200
They say that...

21:20.400 --> 21:24.800
I bought the knife that was used
to slay my Natalie.

21:26.100 --> 21:28.000
I did buy a knife.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.200
I lost it on a camping trip.

21:31.100 --> 21:32.500
They say I...

21:32.500 --> 21:34.900
left the hotel
carrying a satchel.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.800
It's true.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.900
It was full of clothes.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.800
They say I drove off to...

21:43.100 --> 21:45.500
dispose of my wife's head.

21:45.900 --> 21:47.500
What I really did

21:48.400 --> 21:52.500
was back away from an ugly fight
to cool off.

21:52.700 --> 21:56.100
The truth is,
I did the right things.

21:56.100 --> 21:57.600
But instead,

21:57.600 --> 22:00.100
they're saying I did something

22:00.100 --> 22:03.100
almost beyond
human comprehension.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.600
So I beg you,

22:08.300 --> 22:11.500
if you believe it's possible
that one,

22:11.500 --> 22:15.100
just one of the things
that they say happen didn't,

22:16.100 --> 22:17.700
you have to ask:

22:18.800 --> 22:21.300
Did they really get
the right man?

22:35.500 --> 22:36.300
Hey.

22:36.300 --> 22:39.500
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

22:39.700 --> 22:41.600
I may be getting a call
from work.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.500
I should probably order, too.

22:43.500 --> 22:44.400
I can't stay long.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.700
Sure thing.
Uh...

22:47.000 --> 22:49.100
Is this the same case
you were working on yesterday?

22:49.100 --> 22:50.100
I'm guessing you're a lawyer.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.100
Oh, no, I didn't actually
finish law school.

22:52.100 --> 22:55.300
I work for the district
attorney, Manuel Devalos.

22:55.900 --> 22:57.200
Sounds impressive.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.400
It's just part-time.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.300
I do a lot of consulting.

23:01.300 --> 23:02.800
Jury selection,

23:02.800 --> 23:04.200
witness preparation,
that sort of thing.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.200
It's not that exciting.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.100
Easy for you to say.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.200
You don't sell pharmaceuticals
for a living.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.200
Excuse me...
Pharmaceuticals, huh?

23:10.200 --> 23:12.100
Yeah-- major boring,

23:12.100 --> 23:13.600
but lucrative and fun

23:13.600 --> 23:15.500
if you don't mind traveling
ten months a year.

23:15.500 --> 23:18.900
I don't mind, but I think
my husband and three kids might complain.

23:18.900 --> 23:22.200
Three kids? Boy, I can
barely keep my cat alive.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.500
Excuse me. Uh...

23:27.500 --> 23:29.000
So what's this case?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.200
Uh, you're not from the area.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.800
I don't know if you heard of it.

23:33.100 --> 23:35.300
There's a guy named
Walter Paxton.

23:35.300 --> 23:37.500
Chopped off his wife's head
and hid it somewhere.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.600
Everybody's heard about it.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.600
How does
someone do that?

23:40.800 --> 23:42.500
And how do they stand up
in front of a jury

23:42.500 --> 23:45.800
when they know they're guilty--when everybody knows
they're guilty-- and just lie?

23:46.600 --> 23:48.600
You just hope that the jury
sees through it.

23:48.600 --> 23:50.900
You just hope that you picked
the right jurors.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.200
And that's where you come in?

23:52.200 --> 23:53.400
That's where I come in.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.300
Give me a second?

23:56.700 --> 23:59.800
You know, I think I saw
your boss on the news
the other night.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.400
Yeah, hi.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.600
Can you turn around a second?

24:04.200 --> 24:06.100
Yeah, you see
that woman waving?
(chuckles)

24:07.200 --> 24:10.100
That's me. My friend and I would
really like to order,

24:10.100 --> 24:11.500
so can you send the waiter over?

24:11.500 --> 24:13.700
That'd be great.
Thanks.

24:16.600 --> 24:17.600
So?

24:17.900 --> 24:18.800
So what?

24:18.800 --> 24:20.300
So...

24:20.300 --> 24:22.000
what's it like working
for the D.A.?

24:22.600 --> 24:24.300
Do you have any comments
about today's news?

24:24.300 --> 24:27.500
I'm actually very encouraged
by today's decision.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.900
But while we may all be talking
about my vindication...

24:47.800 --> 24:48.800
What are you doing?

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Hi. Sorry, text message.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.400
Someone from work.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.200
Is everything okay?

24:58.200 --> 24:59.900
Yeah, everything's fine.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.400
I just... I couldn't sleep,
so I figured I'd do it now.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.500
Come on.
Let's go back to bed.

25:18.900 --> 25:20.200
Hello.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.000
Mom, it's for you.

25:24.700 --> 25:25.400
Hello.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.100
Allison, it's Manuel.

25:27.500 --> 25:30.300
Sorry to call so early,but I thought you'd like to know
the jury's in.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.300
????

25:35.600 --> 25:37.400
??

25:37.800 --> 25:39.200
We have, Your Honor.

25:40.400 --> 25:43.300
In the matter of <i>ThePeople</i>
 <i>v. Walter Paxton,</i>

25:43.300 --> 25:47.300
we find the defendant
guilty of murder in the first degree.

25:53.300 --> 25:55.900
Now all we need
to do is to convince a sentencing jury 

25:55.900 --> 25:57.700
that
Mr. Walter Paxton
deserves death

25:57.700 --> 25:58.700
for what he did
to his wife.

25:58.700 --> 25:59.900
Hear, hear.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.400
Thank you for
the encouragement.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.600
Oh...

26:06.400 --> 26:07.700
Any time at all.

26:09.700 --> 26:10.800
Wow.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.400
Look at what
you went and did.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.500
Now, that is what I call
engineering.

26:19.100 --> 26:20.600
Not bad, huh?

26:21.000 --> 26:22.600
Not bad at all.

26:24.100 --> 26:28.700
I'd get up and give you a hug,
but I am really, really tired.

26:28.700 --> 26:30.800
I can't imagine why.

26:33.100 --> 26:35.200
So this is the little fellow

26:35.500 --> 26:38.300
who wouldn't let you drink
coffee these last few months.

26:39.200 --> 26:42.000
I think he's gonna be a
tea drinker like Steven.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.900
Speaking of
the proud papa,where is he?

26:44.900 --> 26:46.900
I have a very cheap cigar
for him.

26:46.900 --> 26:49.500
He went to the airport
to pick his folks up.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.800
Did you manage to get back to
sleep last night?

26:55.300 --> 26:58.700
I had no idea that I sent
a text so late.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.600
No, it was fine.
I was fine.

27:01.400 --> 27:04.600
Uh, no, I was actually glad
to get it.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.800
I was happy to hear
that everything went well.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.900
That you were well,
the baby was well.

27:11.900 --> 27:13.100
Are you well?

27:13.300 --> 27:14.900
Me? I'm excellent.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.100
I'm absolutely excellent.

27:22.700 --> 27:25.400
I have been seeing a therapist
that the company hired.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.800
I'm actually supposed
to be in his office right now.

27:28.400 --> 27:29.800
He's that good, huh?

27:30.300 --> 27:31.400
(sighs):
I don't know.

27:32.600 --> 27:35.200
Maybe I just went back
to work a little too soon.

27:36.400 --> 27:39.100
Apparently I'm angry
or depressed or...

27:41.100 --> 27:44.300
I just can't focus at work
or something.

27:44.300 --> 27:45.800
Other than that...

27:51.600 --> 27:53.400
How's your wife
doing with it?

27:53.500 --> 27:54.600
How do you mean?

27:56.100 --> 27:58.200
I've been horrible to Steven.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.700
I'm angry with him
because he wasn't there,

28:04.800 --> 28:07.200
like that was
a choice he made.

28:09.300 --> 28:11.100
Thank God for hormones.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.400
They've been getting
a lot of the blame lately.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.400
You really don't
mind the texting?

28:18.400 --> 28:19.600
I know I do it a lot,

28:19.600 --> 28:23.900
but it... it really makes me
feel better.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.100
I look forward to it.

28:29.300 --> 28:30.500
Just wanted to remind you

28:30.500 --> 28:33.000
it's time for the baby's
feeding, Mrs. Bell.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Speaking of feeding,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.100
I should probably go
get myself some lunch.

28:37.100 --> 28:40.200
Um, yeah, congratulations again.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.700
He's beautiful.

28:42.500 --> 28:43.400
Uh, hey,

28:43.600 --> 28:47.100
have you been getting, like,
hundreds of calls from that Cooper guy?

28:47.700 --> 28:49.100
I'm sorry. Calls from who?

28:50.100 --> 28:52.100
Okay, I guess it's just me then.

28:52.100 --> 28:54.000
I thought it had something
to do with the incident,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
but I guess not.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.300
I'll just return one of them
and see what he wants.

29:00.300 --> 29:01.600
Okay.

29:01.800 --> 29:04.500
REPORTER:
 <i>This was the scene</i> at the Phoenix courthouse
earlier today,

29:04.500 --> 29:08.000
just moments after Walter Paxton
was found guilty of murder

29:08.000 --> 29:09.300
in the first degree.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.800
Mr. Paxton, who was accused
of killing 

29:11.800 --> 29:14.000
and then decapitating
his wife Natalie 

29:14.000 --> 29:15.400
in their downtown hotel room...

29:15.400 --> 29:16.400
Will you shut
that off?

29:16.400 --> 29:18.200
I've seen enough of
that man for a lifetime.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.500
Sentencing is scheduled
to begin next week.

29:29.700 --> 29:30.700
Kids down?

29:30.700 --> 29:32.100
Yeah, and it
wasn't easy.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.300
Bridgette kept trying
to say good night

29:34.300 --> 29:35.500
at the exact same
time as I did,

29:35.500 --> 29:36.700
so she could
jinx me.

29:36.700 --> 29:38.300
Her own mother.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.400
Breaks your heart,
doesn't it?

29:40.900 --> 29:41.900
Mm!

29:41.900 --> 29:43.200
What you doing?

29:47.100 --> 29:48.900
I'm being proactive.

29:49.600 --> 29:50.900
And what does that mean?

29:52.700 --> 29:54.900
I miss my husband.

29:54.900 --> 29:57.100
Well, that's silly.
He's here.

29:57.900 --> 29:59.600
Then tell me about your day.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.900
Tell me about therapy;
tell me what's going on.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.100
Nothing's going on.

30:07.800 --> 30:09.600
I didn't go to therapy.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.000
I don't understand.

30:13.100 --> 30:15.400
You want to go back
to work, don't you?

30:15.600 --> 30:17.700
Isn't this the therapist that
the company's counting on

30:17.700 --> 30:20.300
to tell them if you're
ready to go back or not?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.400
I'll go tomorrow.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.300
Then I'll go the day after.

30:25.900 --> 30:27.300
He'll think that's progress.

30:27.300 --> 30:28.800
He'll think he cured me.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.000
And don't look at me like that.

30:38.400 --> 30:39.900
I'm sorry.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.000
I don't mean to upset you.

30:43.400 --> 30:47.100
I really am feeling better;
I really will go tomorrow.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.200
I love you so much, Joe.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.700
I just want you
to be happy again.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.400
I will be happy again.

31:00.200 --> 31:01.800
I really will.

31:04.100 --> 31:05.300
I'm sorry.

31:18.100 --> 31:20.800
If you could please sign here
and initial here,

31:20.800 --> 31:23.100
I'll have a bellman
bring your bags up to your room.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.600
Excellent, Ms. Hensley.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.800
Thank you for staying
at the Phoenix Hilton.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.800
It's Scanlon.

31:35.900 --> 31:38.200
Hey, it's 5:00 in the morning.

31:55.400 --> 31:56.400
Allison?

31:58.300 --> 32:00.100
This place is so familiar.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.400
I hate to pull you two
out of bed, but, uh,

32:04.100 --> 32:06.000
I thought you needed
to see this.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.100
The, uh, victim's
name was Ramona...

32:09.100 --> 32:11.100
...Hensley.
...Hensley.

32:11.100 --> 32:12.900
Honestly, that's all
I have is a name.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.300
33 years old.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.100
Insurance broker in town
for a convention.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.000
No sign of a break-in,

32:18.000 --> 32:19.400
so her killer
either had a key

32:19.400 --> 32:21.100
or he convinced her
to let him in.

32:21.200 --> 32:24.000
It appears he attacked her
in the bathroom here.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.400
Got her in the bathtub.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.000
Decapitated her and...

32:27.000 --> 32:30.100
Wait a second--
did you say decapitated her?

32:31.700 --> 32:35.200
Lee, what are you being
so cryptic about here?

32:35.200 --> 32:36.000
What are we looking at,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.200
some sort
of Paxton copycat killing?

32:38.900 --> 32:41.500
That's what I thought
when they first called me.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.900
Ugh! What's that smell?

32:44.400 --> 32:45.600
Formaldehyde.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.000
The coroner hasn't
weighed in yet,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.500
but we think that's what he used
to preserve the head.

32:50.500 --> 32:51.800
Preserve the head? I don't understand.

32:51.800 --> 32:55.100
Didn't you say this killing
occurred hours ago?

32:55.100 --> 32:57.300
I'm not talking
about Ramona Hensley's head.

33:04.300 --> 33:05.900
Oh, my God.

33:06.700 --> 33:08.100
Is that...?

33:08.100 --> 33:09.700
ALLISON:
Natalie Paxton.

33:10.700 --> 33:12.700
????

33:12.900 --> 33:15.100
??

33:18.200 --> 33:19.300
Okay.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.100
Deputy Mayor says hello.

33:23.300 --> 33:25.900
City Hall's already being
inundated with

33:25.900 --> 33:28.900
calls from the press,
from outraged citizens,

33:28.900 --> 33:32.600
people calling for
the immediate release
of Walter Paxton.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.500
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.400
There's nothing to say.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.500
I chose to prosecute this case.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.900
There's nothing for you
to feel badly about.

33:43.900 --> 33:44.900
That's not true.

33:44.900 --> 33:47.500
You told me yourself-- I
encouraged you to go for broke.

33:47.500 --> 33:50.100
And I swear, I never would have

33:50.100 --> 33:52.500
if I hadn't seen him
do it myself...

33:52.500 --> 33:54.500
night after night.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.700
I don't know how
I could've been so wrong.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.800
Wait a second.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.300
She never actually saw him.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.000
Natalie never actually saw who her killer was.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.500
He came up from behind her.

34:12.500 --> 34:14.400
What are you
talking about?
In my dream.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.699
She must have died
thinking he did it.

34:17.100 --> 34:19.000
She was so angry at him
at the time,

34:19.000 --> 34:20.800
so hurt by all that he'd done.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.100
That's why she sent me
those dreams.

34:23.100 --> 34:24.699
She thought he did it.

34:24.699 --> 34:26.400
She never actually saw Walter,

34:26.400 --> 34:28.800
or whoever it was
who really did it.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Okay.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.000
Well, of course.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.699
You're right, who cares?

34:43.500 --> 34:45.900
Doesn't really change anything.

34:48.900 --> 34:49.699
Yeah.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.500
We have no comment
at this time.

34:52.500 --> 34:53.800
You just tell
anyone who calls

34:53.800 --> 34:56.600
that we're still putting
together a statement

34:56.600 --> 34:57.900
and as soon as
it's ready,

34:57.900 --> 35:01.000
we'll put it out to
the appropriate media outlets.

35:23.700 --> 35:24.900
Thanks.

35:30.800 --> 35:31.900
Joe Dubois.

35:32.100 --> 35:32.800
Mr. Dubois?

35:32.800 --> 35:34.400
Am I catching you at a bad time?

35:34.400 --> 35:35.900
I'm sorry,
who am I speaking with?

35:36.100 --> 35:38.400
My name is Conroy.
Cooper Conroy.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.900
I'm an attorney, Mr. Dubois.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.400
Can you talk for a moment?

35:42.500 --> 35:45.300
I'm actually about to head off
to the doctor.

35:45.300 --> 35:47.700
All I'm looking for
is an appointment, Mr. Dubois,

35:47.700 --> 35:50.200
an opportunity
to sit down and talk.

35:50.200 --> 35:51.700
Talk? About what?

35:52.000 --> 35:55.100
About millions of dollars
I believe you're entitled to.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.000
Mr. Dubois? Did you hear me?

36:00.100 --> 36:02.900
I... I really, uh, I really
have to go to the doctor.

36:02.900 --> 36:04.700
Okay, that's fine.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.700
You have my number
on your cell phone now.

36:06.700 --> 36:09.700
So I'm going to wait
for you to call me.

36:09.700 --> 36:11.600
I just need an hour, Mr. Dubois.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.800
And I do believe you'll find
what I have to say...

36:14.700 --> 36:16.600
REPORTER:
Do you have any comments
about today's news?

36:16.600 --> 36:19.600
I'm actually very encouraged
by today's decision.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.500
But while we may all
be talking about

36:21.500 --> 36:23.300
my vindication and release,

36:23.300 --> 36:25.200
we shouldn't lose sight
of the fact

36:25.200 --> 36:29.200
that this isn't just
about the misguided prosecution

36:29.200 --> 36:30.800
of an innocent man.

36:30.900 --> 36:33.700
The real victims of this tragedy
have yet to be avenged.

36:33.700 --> 36:36.600
And while I may be thrilled
to be out of jail,

36:36.600 --> 36:40.300
nothing that happened
in there today is going to bring
my Natalie back.

36:40.300 --> 36:41.300
And that's why...
(TV clicks off)

36:50.900 --> 36:51.600
Hello?

36:51.600 --> 36:53.000
Are you avoiding me?

36:53.600 --> 36:55.200
I left you, like, 100 messages.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.300
Yeah.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.700
It's just been kind of
a complicated day around here.

36:58.700 --> 37:00.100
You think I don't know that.

37:00.300 --> 37:01.900
You think I don't
watch the news.

37:01.900 --> 37:03.300
That's why I was calling you.

37:03.300 --> 37:04.800
I was concerned about you.

37:05.800 --> 37:06.800
Well, I'm fine.

37:06.800 --> 37:07.500
Okay.

37:07.800 --> 37:10.400
'Cause I was just sitting here
in my friendly hotel bar

37:10.400 --> 37:12.900
thinking you might need someone
to talk to about it all.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.500
You are very sweet.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.600
But then I forgot you have
hubby for that, don't you?

37:18.100 --> 37:19.100
Well, actually...

37:19.100 --> 37:21.500
hubby hasn't been
all that talkative lately.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.000
Well, then get your ass down here-- I'm buying.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.500
Oh, God, it's the middle
of the week.

37:27.500 --> 37:30.100
We're all kind of in bed mode
around here.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.600
 <i>Entres vous.</i>

37:41.500 --> 37:44.400
I don't think I've ever
seen you take a bath before.

37:44.400 --> 37:47.000
Not since I was nine, maybe.

37:47.300 --> 37:49.700
I don't know,
I just wanted to think.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.700
I understand.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.500
You know that woman, Debra,
the woman who hit my car?

37:56.500 --> 37:58.700
She just called, she wanted
to know if we could meet,

37:58.700 --> 37:59.700
maybe get a drink.

37:59.700 --> 38:01.100
I told her it was late.

38:01.100 --> 38:03.700
Ah, the girls are down.

38:04.300 --> 38:06.500
I'm okay in here.

38:07.900 --> 38:09.100
Okay.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.200
Wow, I'm kind of
surprised.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.400
Feels kind of weird
going without you.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.900
Don't be silly.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.800
Okay.
Well, if you're sure.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.100
Yeah.

38:25.100 --> 38:26.700
I mean, it's just for
a couple hours, right?

38:26.700 --> 38:28.500
If that.
Okay.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Oh, that's okay.

38:31.000 --> 38:31.900
I got it.

38:33.300 --> 38:35.300
Are you expecting a call
tonight?

38:36.500 --> 38:37.800
Or maybe a text?

38:37.800 --> 38:39.000
It's not
what you think.
Well, good.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.900
'Cause what I'm
thinking is not good.

38:42.000 --> 38:42.500
hey

38:42.500 --> 38:43.400
sorry 

38:45.800 --> 38:47.600
I feel so badly for you.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.400
I feel so badly for your boss.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.800
They're just destroying
him on television.

38:51.900 --> 38:55.300
I know, I can't help but
think a lot of that's my fault.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.000
How do you mean?

39:01.700 --> 39:04.700
Before Paxton fired
his lawyer, she came to us,

39:05.600 --> 39:06.900
she wanted to make a deal.

39:07.300 --> 39:10.500
25 years, possibility
of parole after 12.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.400
A lot of people thought
my boss should consider it,

39:14.400 --> 39:17.500
but I kind of
convinced him not to.

39:18.500 --> 39:21.100
Wow, sounds like you have
a lot of sway over your boss.

39:22.100 --> 39:23.000
Well, even if it's true,

39:23.000 --> 39:26.600
I don't see how that
makes you responsible.

39:26.900 --> 39:29.000
Paxton has never wavered.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.900
He's always insisted
he was innocent.

39:30.900 --> 39:33.800
It seems pretty obvious he would
never have agreed to a deal.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.100
I don't know.

39:35.100 --> 39:37.200
Maybe if I hadn't
said anything.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.600
If we'd just entertained
the possibility;

39:39.600 --> 39:41.300
if the two lawyers
had started talking,

39:41.300 --> 39:44.400
the judge most
certainly would have suspended the trial
a couple of days

39:44.400 --> 39:46.400
and the other body
would have shown up.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.600
Paxton would have
never been convicted.

39:49.800 --> 39:51.800
Your boss really
listens to you, huh?

39:52.600 --> 39:54.100
A lot of times, yeah.

39:55.300 --> 39:56.400
You and he...

39:56.400 --> 39:58.900
Oh, God, no! No.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.000
No, I'm married.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.800
I love my husband.
I'm sorry.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.300
I mean, no offense, but why
does even care what you think?

40:12.100 --> 40:14.100
I'm sorry, am I being too nosy?

40:16.400 --> 40:17.500
I just...

40:17.700 --> 40:18.500
I love this stuff.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.800
I'm kind of a
Court TV junkie.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.600
I think you have
the coolest job.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.300
So what made you
change your mind?

40:25.300 --> 40:26.600
First, you said you
weren't coming tonight

40:26.600 --> 40:28.400
and you called back
and said you were.

40:30.700 --> 40:31.600
I don't know.

40:31.600 --> 40:34.300
My husband's kind of
going through something.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.000
I guess we both thought

40:37.000 --> 40:39.200
he could use a little
time to himself.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.000
I never do this.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.600
Go out by myself.

40:44.900 --> 40:46.700
You don't have
any friends?

40:46.700 --> 40:47.500
Yeah.

40:49.400 --> 40:50.400
No.

40:51.300 --> 40:53.900
I have work friends
and my husband...

40:54.600 --> 40:56.800
Sure, I have friends--
everybody has friends.

40:57.100 --> 40:59.500
You ask a lot of questions,
you know that?

41:00.400 --> 41:02.500
I know; everyone says
that-- it's horrible.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.900
And I think it's
my way of avoiding
answering any questions.

41:04.900 --> 41:07.300
Oh, really?
I'm not answering that.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.100
I'm not answering that either.

41:10.700 --> 41:12.400
How about another drink?
I'm buying.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.200
You can't fool me.

41:13.200 --> 41:14.700
I'm not answering
that either.

41:41.400 --> 41:42.700
OFFICER:
Detective.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.200
So this is where
all the action is.

41:54.300 --> 41:57.100
Well, now we know where the head
of the third victim ended up.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.000
So who does the body
belong to?

42:01.500 --> 42:03.400
There's some discrepancy
about the name,

42:03.400 --> 42:06.500
but I can show you her
driver's license photo.
