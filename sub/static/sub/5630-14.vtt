WEBVTT

00:06.606 --> 00:08.240
<i>- Officers are on the trail</i>

00:08.242 --> 00:10.309
<i>of escaped inmate Greg Yates.</i>

00:10.311 --> 00:12.478
- I am going to need
all the help that I can get.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.346
- Erin still hasn't
forgiven herself

00:14.348 --> 00:16.215
<i>for what Yates did to Nadia.</i>

00:16.216 --> 00:18.217
- Nadia talked a lot about you.

00:18.219 --> 00:21.053
- The last time he was on
the run, he went on a spree.

00:21.055 --> 00:24.289
- Yates's crimes include
rape, torture, and murder.

00:24.291 --> 00:25.557
- Son of a bitch.

00:25.559 --> 00:26.558
This is Yates.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.261
<i>- He won't hesitate</i>
<i>to kill again.</i>

00:29.263 --> 00:30.596
[gunshot]

00:30.598 --> 00:33.265
- Detective!
Get back here!

00:37.771 --> 00:41.073
- [groaning]

00:43.076 --> 00:46.145
Aah.

[groans]

01:35.161 --> 01:38.831
Hey...it's okay.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.100
I'm the police.
Are you all right?

01:41.102 --> 01:43.168
- My daddy.

01:45.138 --> 01:48.440
- I need you to stay right
where you are, okay?

02:00.487 --> 02:01.854
[grunts]

02:05.325 --> 02:07.192
[gunshots continue]

03:04.951 --> 03:07.719
- Greg Yates escaped custody
last night in upstate New York

03:07.721 --> 03:09.588
after killing
two state troopers,

03:09.590 --> 03:11.657
two ConElectric workers,
and a camper,

03:11.659 --> 03:13.225
and shooting Sergeant Dodds.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.260
Dodds, he'll make
a full recovery, thank God.

03:15.262 --> 03:16.728
- And Yates?

03:16.730 --> 03:18.630
- Pennsylvania troopers
found the pickup truck

03:18.632 --> 03:20.465
abandoned on a state road.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.234
State forensics
lifted Yates's prints,

03:22.236 --> 03:23.735
and a motorist there IDed Yates

03:23.737 --> 03:25.437
as pretending
to have car trouble

03:25.439 --> 03:26.805
and knocking him out
to take his car.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.708
- He repeated the pattern
in Ohio and Indiana.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.678
The last vehicle brought him
to the Illinois border.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.580
Crime lab confirms
Yates's prints,

03:34.582 --> 03:35.614
but there's no leads after that.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.449
- Yeah, except one.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.520
Erin.
The reason Yates is here.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.655
- No. He's just trying
to get in our heads.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.657
We put out a BOLO,
investigative alert,

03:45.659 --> 03:46.892
and AMBER Alerts on the vehicle.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.527
Troopers are watching
every highway

03:48.529 --> 03:49.828
coming into Chicago.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.930
- SVU is questioning
Carl Rudnick,

03:51.932 --> 03:54.399
the guy Yates escaped with,
who's back in custody.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.567
Lieutenant Benson
will be in touch

03:55.569 --> 03:59.504
- Well, until then I want us on
every transient hotel,

03:59.506 --> 04:01.673
shelter, food bank in the city.

04:01.675 --> 04:05.811
Remember, this guy will kill
or maim to get what he wants.

04:07.714 --> 04:10.382
Hey, flag the credit cards
of the vehicle owners.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.652
See if there was a safe haven
he used last time he was here.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.488
All right, let's get on it.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.726
- How's your knee?

04:20.728 --> 04:23.662
- It's okay.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.431
I'm fine.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.766
- All right, I'm gonna run
with the carjack victims.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.636
See if he grabbed any phones.
- Okay.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.804
Thanks.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.374
[winces]

04:35.376 --> 04:39.011
- Erin, Antonio,
come on in here.

04:39.013 --> 04:41.880
- So Rudnick said that Yates
befriended a guard

04:41.882 --> 04:43.782
who slipped him
contraband phones.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.684
<i>We found this in his cell</i>

04:45.686 --> 04:48.820
<i>with a search triangulating</i>
<i>a Chicago neighborhood.</i>

04:48.822 --> 04:51.356
<i>I'm texting you a screenshot</i>
<i>that we recovered.</i>

04:54.727 --> 04:57.929
- South Loop.
Around 16th and Indiana.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.032
- That's near your apartment.

05:00.034 --> 05:01.833
- It doesn't mean anything.
- Erin.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.670
- Hank, Burgess and Roman
just made notification

05:04.672 --> 05:06.972
of a triple homicide
all in one apartment building,

05:06.974 --> 05:08.940
a fourth woman hanging on.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.309
All female.
All nurses.

05:10.311 --> 05:11.943
This sounds like your guy.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.813
<i>- Fin and I are on</i>
<i>the next flight.</i>

05:14.815 --> 05:18.850
- You ride with me.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.652
- A meter reader called it in.

05:20.654 --> 05:24.856
He knocked, and the door
pushed open to this.

05:24.858 --> 05:25.991
Best we can figure,

05:25.993 --> 05:27.926
the first victim
opened the door.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.028
He pushed in
and knocked her down.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.697
- What's this?

05:31.699 --> 05:32.864
- Pieces of scalp
covered with partial hair,

05:32.866 --> 05:34.733
so he must have dragged her,

05:34.735 --> 05:36.868
and there's multiple dents
in the floor

05:36.870 --> 05:38.770
where he slammed her into it.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.773
<i>[ominous music]</i>

05:41.775 --> 05:43.442
<i>â™ª</i>

05:43.444 --> 05:45.944
- Roommate was in the shower?
- Tub.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.847
We think the first victim
threw a vase to warn her friend,

05:48.849 --> 05:50.682
but too late.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.883
She must have heard her friend,
got out of the tub,

05:51.885 --> 05:53.352
and locked the door.

05:53.354 --> 05:56.088
- Hank.
You're gonna want to see this.

05:56.090 --> 05:58.890
- Yours, come on.
Thanks.

06:03.463 --> 06:05.864
- He broke
the door down,

06:05.866 --> 06:08.633
slammed her into the wall
in several places.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.402
There's defensive bruising
on her arms,

06:10.404 --> 06:12.871
multiple lacerations
on her knuckles.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.005
She put up a good fight.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.107
- [scoffs]

06:15.109 --> 06:17.676
It's still warm.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.415
- The roommate's
on her way to Med.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.016
This one must have not had
heard anything downstairs.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.451
Back door's open.

06:26.453 --> 06:27.953
We think he heard
the meter reader

06:27.955 --> 06:31.690
and bolted before he could
finish off the roommate.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.793
- So thing is, boss,
all the purses were emptied.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.862
All the jewelry boxes
were gone through.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.063
- No, that's not his MO.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.133
- Well, there's more than that.

06:41.135 --> 06:44.069
That's not him either.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.005
No victim shows any signs
of a sexual assault.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.974
- It's nurses.
It's blunt force trauma.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.142
This is Yates.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.777
- This cut's
neat, precise,

06:51.779 --> 06:55.480
like a doctor would do.
She might be right.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.884
Now, what's happening
on the third floor?

06:58.886 --> 07:00.719
- It's clear.
No sign of foul play,

07:00.721 --> 07:02.687
and the tenant, Nellie Carr,
she isn't there.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.089
- Maybe she heard
or seen something.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.658
- Well, we got to find her.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.828
Let's get an all call message
going for this Nellie Carr.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.830
Roman, get a list
of what's missing, every item,

07:11.832 --> 07:14.666
and somebody get me a print
that can put Yates here.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.134
- Me and Halstead
should probably follow the ambo,

07:16.136 --> 07:18.069
see if our victim comes out,
then we can ID.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.871
- I'll go with you.
- No.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.673
You and I are heading back
to the 21st.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.776
We're gonna find
that third floor tenant.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.847
- You're benching me.
- I'm keeping you safe.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.683
- We just left a scene
with three dead nurses.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.951
I'm not the one
you need to worry about.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.053
- Erin, he's baiting you.
- No, he's not.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.221
He's using me to get

07:36.223 --> 07:38.056
under your skin,
and it's working.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.692
- You make one mistake
with Yates, you're dead.

07:40.694 --> 07:41.993
You get that?
- If he wanted me,

07:41.995 --> 07:43.929
he would have had me
in upstate New York.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.130
- Well, he's not getting
a second chance.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.933
[cell phone rings]

07:47.935 --> 07:49.701
- It's Bunny.

07:49.703 --> 07:50.969
She's back from Reno.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.838
Kicked husband number
five to the curb.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.473
- She want more money?
- I don't know what she wants.

07:54.475 --> 07:58.477
Hank, if I'm bait,
let me be bait.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.946
I can draw him in.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.982
Let me do my job.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.952
- Get in the car.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.723
- She never woke up?

08:11.725 --> 08:13.758
- She lost too much blood
at the scene.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.829
I'm sorry.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.932
- Yeah, there was never
gonna be an ID.

08:22.735 --> 08:23.969
- [chuckles]

08:23.971 --> 08:25.770
All right,
guys, have a good day.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.873
See you.

08:30.209 --> 08:32.510
- [panting]

08:37.250 --> 08:39.717
Nellie Carr?
- Do I know you?

08:39.720 --> 08:41.785
- No.

08:41.788 --> 08:44.289
I know you.

08:49.161 --> 08:52.230
- Do you remember
what you talked about?

08:52.232 --> 08:53.698
- He was showing us a photo
of Professor Carr on his phone.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.166
- Wait, Carr?
Nellie Carr?

08:55.168 --> 08:57.135
- Yes, he said
she was his college girlfriend

08:57.137 --> 08:58.570
and he was in town for the week.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.572
- She was covering a class.

09:00.574 --> 09:04.042
I told him she was on her way
to the parking lot.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.279
Oh, God.

09:07.281 --> 09:10.215
- Okay, thank you.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.150
So he was looking for
Nellie Carr this whole time.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.952
First at the apartments,
then here.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.954
- But she's 40-something
with red hair.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.289
That doesn't make sense.

09:17.291 --> 09:18.590
- Well, neither does the MO
from this morning,

09:18.592 --> 09:19.925
but everyone
who IDed him said

09:19.927 --> 09:21.326
he was specifically
looking for her.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.928
- Hey, guys.

09:22.930 --> 09:27.032
There's a note left
in the car Yates drove here.

09:31.037 --> 09:33.104
- "Too bad
you're at the station, Erin.

09:33.106 --> 09:37.208
You're missing all the fun."

09:37.210 --> 09:39.311
What the hell is going on?

09:42.950 --> 09:45.116
- We swept the entire building
in and out.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.318
Sergeant, there is no way Yates

09:46.320 --> 09:47.919
could know
where Detective Lindsay is.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.321
- Except he does,
so figure it out.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.856
- Yes, sir.
- Lindsay.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.059
- I've got an investigative
alert out on Yates and Nellie,

09:54.061 --> 09:55.860
her car, cell phone,
and credit cards.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.295
- All right,
I want uniforms door to door

09:57.297 --> 09:59.331
through that campus.
Get recruits if you have to.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.132
- We got to figure out
what the connection

10:01.134 --> 10:02.367
is between Yates and Nellie.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.035
I need his working file. I--

10:04.037 --> 10:05.270
- I pulled it.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.138
We're setting up
a hotline right now,

10:07.140 --> 10:09.841
so blue is for sightings
already called in,

10:09.843 --> 10:11.343
green is for places
we know he's been,

10:11.345 --> 10:13.078
and red is for
former crime sites

10:13.080 --> 10:15.080
with photos and intel
on each victim.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.382
Also, there's a list of
other hospitals he might target,

10:17.384 --> 10:21.052
and this is hotline phone number
for the news.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.988
- Thanks, Trudy.
Commander?

10:22.990 --> 10:25.223
- I got the Superintendent
and Mayor on the phone.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.192
News Affairs is sending
someone for an update,

10:27.194 --> 10:30.161
and I've got a press conference
set for a Public Safety Alert.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.997
New York SVU is en route?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.999
- Yeah, they're on their way.
Hey, Detective Lindsay

10:34.001 --> 10:36.067
can help gather
information for the press.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.004
She'll be here.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.338
- Should she be home?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.807
She's too personally
invested in this case.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.042
- The safest place
for Lindsay

10:44.044 --> 10:46.144
is right here in my station.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.346
- Can I help you, Detective?

10:48.348 --> 10:50.115
- You didn't put up
Nadia's picture

10:50.117 --> 10:52.217
with all the other past victims.
Nadia is not up there.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.885
- Yeah, her name is up there.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.987
I--I thought maybe
a photograph--

10:55.989 --> 10:58.123
- She should be up there
with everybody else.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.924
- Absolutely.
I'll fix it.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.993
Sorry.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.935
- Anything you can spare?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.188
- [exhales sharply]

11:30.190 --> 11:33.291
I have so many things
to give you.

11:34.293 --> 11:37.328
- A multi-state manhunt
began yesterday

11:37.330 --> 11:40.298
when convicts Gregory Yates
and Carl Rudnick

11:40.300 --> 11:42.000
escaped through a sewage pipe

11:42.002 --> 11:45.170
at Green Haven Correctional
in New York State.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.338
Mr. Rudnick has been recaptured,

11:47.340 --> 11:49.374
but Mr. Yates is at large,

11:49.376 --> 11:52.077
a suspect in multiple
New York killings

11:52.079 --> 11:55.447
and this morning's murder
of four Chicago nurses

11:55.449 --> 11:57.415
and the abduction
of a nursing teacher

11:57.417 --> 12:00.118
from Chicago's Nursing College.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.087
<i>Yates was serving</i>
<i>a life sentence</i>

12:02.089 --> 12:05.990
<i>for murder and aggravated</i>
<i>criminal sexual assault.</i>

12:05.992 --> 12:09.160
<i>Multiple officers have been</i>
<i>dispatched on foot patrol,</i>

12:09.162 --> 12:12.430
<i>with K-9 units</i>
<i>and helicopters added.</i>

12:12.432 --> 12:14.299
The Intelligence Unit
has been called in

12:14.301 --> 12:16.835
to lead this investigation.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.505
- I got a hit.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.240
Yeah, one of the nurse's
phone cards

12:22.242 --> 12:24.442
is being used a mile
outside their neighborhood.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.078
- All right, ping the cell.
Text the address to Atwater.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.913
- I will,
but a second credit card

12:28.915 --> 12:31.249
turned up at a Best Buy
outside of Humboldt Park.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.751
- And one of
the nurse's bracelets

12:32.753 --> 12:34.285
just showed up at a pawn shop.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.254
They texted a photo
of the woman there too.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.355
- He's passing
this stuff around.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.224
Let's go.
- Erin.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.092
- It would be just like him
to be in one of these places.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.228
Let me do something.
- He's playing us.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.430
- Fine, then send uniforms
and let's pin the maps

12:45.432 --> 12:48.299
and triangulate his location.
Hank--

12:48.301 --> 12:50.468
- Sergeant,
the front desk just called up.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.437
A package was delivered
for Detective Lindsay

12:52.439 --> 12:54.239
by a homeless woman

12:54.241 --> 12:57.008
who IDed Yates as the one
who paid her to drop it off.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.277
It's a big box.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.146
- All right,
get out of the building.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.280
Call the bomb squad.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.283
Get everyone
out of the building now.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.485
Let's go.

13:13.325 --> 13:16.561
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:16.563 --> 13:19.230
- You okay?
I heard you got the call.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.565
- Yeah, it's crazy, right?

13:20.567 --> 13:22.867
- Yeah.

13:32.111 --> 13:34.112
- We x-rayed it.
It's not a bomb.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.815
Your people are safe,

13:36.817 --> 13:40.185
but you're gonna
want to check this out.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.892
- It's addressed to me.
- You want these?

13:47.894 --> 13:50.962
- I got it.
Thank you.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.038
- Oh.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.275
- Erin, don't.

14:10.316 --> 14:11.516
- "Why don't you answer
the phone

14:11.518 --> 14:14.619
when your mother calls?"

14:23.896 --> 14:25.196
- He knows she opened the box.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.965
He's here watching.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.034
Fan out now.
Go, go, go, go.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.336
- That means this morning
it wasn't Bunny who called.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.238
It was Yates.
- He must have spoofed you.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.206
He called from his phone,
made it look like your mom's.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.176
- Just answer it.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.613
<i>- Detective Lindsay.</i>

14:41.615 --> 14:45.183
<i>Hey.</i>

14:45.185 --> 14:47.185
<i>Do you know Nellie Carr?</i>

14:47.187 --> 14:49.053
<i>Nellie, Nurse Nellie.</i>

14:49.055 --> 14:54.425
<i>Hey, that is the wonderful</i>
<i>Detective Lindsay.</i>

14:54.427 --> 14:58.263
<i>Do you--are those dark circles</i>
<i>under your eyes?</i>

14:58.265 --> 15:01.900
<i>Couldn't sleep?</i>
<i>- You've been keeping me busy.</i>

15:01.902 --> 15:03.534
You have my attention now.
What do you need?

15:03.536 --> 15:06.437
<i>- Hmm.</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

15:06.439 --> 15:09.908
<i>Gosh, what do I need?</i>

15:09.910 --> 15:11.576
- Where is he?
- I'm on with Lindsay's carrier.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.611
A real time, loss of life,

15:13.613 --> 15:15.580
exigent circumstances emergency.

15:15.582 --> 15:19.984
I need information on a call
connected to one of our phones.

15:19.986 --> 15:22.387
- Did you want the concern
of the city?

15:22.389 --> 15:23.621
You got that.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.623
Wanted the whole district
to sit up?

15:25.625 --> 15:27.592
Look.
See?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.661
You did all this,

15:29.663 --> 15:32.196
but you keep sending notes
to me,

15:32.198 --> 15:33.698
so why don't you tell me
where you are?

15:33.700 --> 15:34.699
I'll come to you.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.567
<i>- Ah, you know where I am.</i>

15:36.569 --> 15:38.403
- Why don't you pretend
I'm not that clever

15:38.405 --> 15:39.570
and tell me anyway?

15:39.572 --> 15:41.973
<i>- And ruin all the fun?</i>

15:41.975 --> 15:44.042
- Then tell me why you killed
those four nurses

15:44.044 --> 15:47.578
when what you really wanted
was Nellie?

15:47.580 --> 15:51.149
- You are trying to get me to
confess with witnesses present.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.018
You are recording me
without my permission,

15:54.020 --> 15:56.454
and me without a lawyer present.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.056
Shame on you, Detective.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.457
- Okay.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.591
Okay.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.694
Then why me?

16:02.696 --> 16:05.330
Why are you leaving
all the notes for me?

16:05.332 --> 16:09.367
- I've been thinking a lot
about Cain and Abel, you know?

16:09.369 --> 16:11.602
<i>If they were</i>
<i>the only descendants</i>

16:11.604 --> 16:16.708
of Adam and Eve,
and Cain killed Abel, well,

16:16.710 --> 16:20.178
you know what that means,
don't you?

16:20.180 --> 16:22.180
- They're pinging
his phone right now.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.650
- We're all descendants
of a murderer.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.987
[laughs softly]

16:28.989 --> 16:32.090
I will see you soon, Detective.

16:34.126 --> 16:38.096
- Wait.
No! Come--damn--ah, dammit.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.630
He powered down.
They lost him.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.066
- Mouse, how does he know
where she is

16:42.068 --> 16:46.104
or what we've been doing, huh?

16:46.106 --> 16:49.207
- Your phone.
Let me see your phone.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.116
Detective Lindsay's phone,

16:58.118 --> 16:59.617
it's using five times
the regular data.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.486
That means--
- Spyware.

17:01.488 --> 17:04.088
- Yeah. Okay, he's been
listening in on conversations.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.690
He's probably been reading
texts, e-mails.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.492
He can turn on the camera
in the car and in the bullpen.

17:07.493 --> 17:09.027
- But how would he have
access to it?

17:09.029 --> 17:10.694
When?

17:10.696 --> 17:13.031
- When we went to the jail
we had to surrender our phones.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.665
- The corrupt guard.

17:14.666 --> 17:17.234
- Give it to me.

17:18.737 --> 17:22.339
Wait.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.709
Guys, I know where he is.
He's in my apartment.

17:24.711 --> 17:28.212
Picture's at my place.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.548
- Let's go.

17:43.529 --> 17:46.097
- It's clear.

17:46.099 --> 17:49.500
- Sarge.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.803
- Open it.

17:51.805 --> 17:53.738
- No, no!
Stop, stop!

17:53.740 --> 17:55.706
- Where's Yates?
Where'd he go?

17:55.708 --> 17:57.575
- I don't know, I don't know.
He's not out there?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.610
- He left you here?
- He said to stay inside.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.113
He said if I left, he'd
be outside waiting to kill me.

18:02.115 --> 18:05.216
Is he gone?

18:06.151 --> 18:09.253
- Come on.
- You'll be okay.

18:13.525 --> 18:14.692
- Well, look what the cat
dragged in.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.494
- Chicago, Chicago.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.795
Now, why we got
to keep coming here?

18:17.797 --> 18:20.398
You can't catch
these bad guys on your own?

18:20.400 --> 18:21.632
- We wouldn't have to
if New York

18:21.634 --> 18:23.668
could keep killers
in their jails.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.503
- Wow, the loudmouth teenager.

18:25.505 --> 18:29.407
- Lieutenant.
- Been getting updates on you.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.542
You okay?

18:36.648 --> 18:38.149
- Glad you're here.

18:48.327 --> 18:52.163
- So it's all about
this nurse, Nellie.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.631
- Well, looks like.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.500
I mean, he terrorized
that apartment building

18:55.502 --> 18:58.769
when he couldn't find her, then
he went straight to the college.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.272
- She doesn't fit
Yates's profile.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.741
- Yeah, not to mention he's
a few miles from Canada

19:03.743 --> 19:05.643
but came here instead.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.245
- We have to figure out
who she is to him.

19:07.247 --> 19:10.915
- I was about to
head downstairs, start asking.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.518
- How's Erin?
- Pissed at me,

19:13.520 --> 19:16.687
but she's alive.

19:16.689 --> 19:20.525
- How about
I interview Nellie with her?

19:21.560 --> 19:25.763
- I--

19:25.765 --> 19:27.932
I was putting books
in my trunk.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.601
He said he had a flat
down the road

19:30.603 --> 19:33.504
and asked if I had
one of those...

19:33.506 --> 19:36.174
- A lug wrench?

19:36.176 --> 19:39.777
- When I reached for it, he--

19:39.779 --> 19:41.245
I don't know him.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.214
He wasn't my boyfriend.

19:43.216 --> 19:44.682
I don't know why he wanted me.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.684
I-I can't.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.922
- Just--just
take a breath, Nellie.

19:50.924 --> 19:55.660
We just--we just
need to find him, okay?

19:57.896 --> 20:01.199
And you can help us do that.

20:02.968 --> 20:05.870
- Did he say
what he wanted

20:05.872 --> 20:08.973
or why he came
to you specifically?

20:08.975 --> 20:12.710
- He--he talked about home,

20:12.712 --> 20:15.613
how everybody needs a home.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.248
He--he asked a lot

20:17.250 --> 20:19.717
of questions about my past,

20:19.719 --> 20:21.252
where I grew up,

20:21.254 --> 20:24.589
what my parents were like,
where they are now.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.524
He kept saying
how everybody wants a home,

20:26.526 --> 20:27.925
to go home.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.694
I thought he was gonna kill me.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.963
- Is Carr your given last name?

20:31.965 --> 20:33.831
- I'm divorced.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.933
The last name I was born
with is Williams.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.501
Why?

20:37.503 --> 20:41.005
- And Nellie
is short for Penelope?

20:43.775 --> 20:45.743
We need to talk.
Excuse us.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.678
- Did anyone reach my mother?

20:47.680 --> 20:49.847
I-if she's seen the news--
is there just a phone I can use?

20:49.849 --> 20:52.683
- Of course.
Just give us one minute.

20:53.685 --> 20:55.019
[door closes]

20:55.021 --> 20:57.655
- The name
"Penelope Williams"

20:57.657 --> 21:00.791
was searched on one
of the phones from Yates's cell.

21:00.793 --> 21:01.926
- Then why would he let her go?

21:01.928 --> 21:03.728
- To send a message to Erin.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.863
Yates's first note said,
"I'll see you at home."

21:05.865 --> 21:07.031
- Mm-hmm.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.667
- He asked Nellie
about her home.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.269
He went to Erin's apartment,

21:11.271 --> 21:12.937
her home.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.005
Where was Yates born?

21:14.007 --> 21:18.042
- North Carolina.

21:18.044 --> 21:21.345
- Let's find out for sure.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.957
- Excuse me, sir?

21:32.959 --> 21:35.660
I'm working on a case
with the Chicago police.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.828
Do you know a Penelope Williams?

21:37.830 --> 21:40.531
- Oh, you're--

21:46.371 --> 21:48.639
- Hey, boss?
- Yeah?

21:48.641 --> 21:51.709
- So, Nellie grew up
Penelope Williams

21:51.711 --> 21:55.079
to parents Susan and Michael
Williams here in Chicago.

21:55.081 --> 21:59.784
The thing is, is they also had
a son by the name of Gregory.

22:01.420 --> 22:04.055
- Yates is Nellie's brother.

22:05.924 --> 22:07.558
- Nellie's mother is downstairs.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.928
- All right, you and Halstead,
as soon as she's seen Nellie,

22:10.930 --> 22:12.430
interview her.

22:12.432 --> 22:13.964
Run his name through DCFS.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.400
Do a national check, too.
Anything you can get.

22:16.402 --> 22:18.536
- On it.

22:18.538 --> 22:21.405
- Greg was a difficult baby.

22:21.407 --> 22:22.440
He was...

22:22.442 --> 22:23.674
off...

22:23.676 --> 22:26.077
from the beginning,

22:26.079 --> 22:29.347
and once he got language
he said terrible things.

22:29.349 --> 22:32.717
He became obsessed with fire
and set one in our basement

22:32.719 --> 22:35.686
by the time he was
four years old.

22:35.688 --> 22:40.391
It wasn't an accident.

22:40.393 --> 22:42.126
<i>When I became pregnant</i>
<i>with Nellie,</i>

22:42.128 --> 22:46.397
<i>small animals</i> would turn up
dead <i>inside the house.</i>

22:46.399 --> 22:48.399
<i>We were terrified of him.</i>

22:48.401 --> 22:51.702
Terrified for the new baby.

22:51.704 --> 22:55.539
We decided that Michael
should take Greg

22:55.541 --> 22:58.075
on one of his hauls and--

22:58.077 --> 23:00.444
- Put him up for adoption
in another state.

23:00.446 --> 23:02.780
North Carolina.

23:02.782 --> 23:05.516
- A pastor
agreed to place him.

23:05.518 --> 23:09.787
Our marriage didn't last
much longer after that.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.021
- Are you in touch
with Greg's father?

23:11.023 --> 23:13.824
- No, Nellie is.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.693
Oh, Michael's
on the road most weeks,

23:15.695 --> 23:17.495
but...

23:21.833 --> 23:24.101
This Greg Yates

23:24.103 --> 23:27.805
that's wanted for all
of these awful things...

23:40.786 --> 23:42.052
- So serial killers

23:42.054 --> 23:44.822
often kill the same person
over and over again.

23:44.824 --> 23:47.525
Susan is a brunette.
She has brown eyes.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.093
She would've been 25

23:49.095 --> 23:51.429
when Michael took him
to North Carolina.

23:51.431 --> 23:52.730
- But he's been
in Chicago before.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.465
He could have looked
for her at any point.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.534
- Michael and Susan Williams
are pretty common names,

23:56.536 --> 23:58.602
but she remarried
and changed her name.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.805
It might've taken him time
to find that new name.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.540
- Time he had plenty of in jail.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.542
- But he's had
a cell phone before,

24:04.544 --> 24:07.211
and it's been 40 years since
they gave him up, so what--

24:07.213 --> 24:08.779
- Back at the hospital,

24:08.781 --> 24:11.549
Rudnick said that Yates
was obsessed with one thing.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.184
Revenge.

24:13.186 --> 24:15.986
- If Yates wanted revenge
on anyone, it would be Rudnick.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.955
Rudnick killed Yates's fiancÃ©e--

24:17.957 --> 24:20.825
- Yates's pregnant fiancÃ©e.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.626
She was pregnant
when she was killed.

24:22.628 --> 24:26.063
- Just like Yates's mother
was with Nellie

24:26.065 --> 24:27.565
when they gave him away.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.200
- And that triggered something
inside him.

24:29.202 --> 24:31.902
- And when he couldn't
find them on his own,

24:31.904 --> 24:33.070
he went through Nellie.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.071
He's come here
to finish 'em off.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.239
That's his end game.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.774
- But what if it's
more than that?

24:36.776 --> 24:38.542
I mean, if you look
at his movements,

24:38.544 --> 24:40.478
he's--he's frenzied.

24:40.480 --> 24:44.048
I don't think that he expects
to make it out of here alive.

24:44.050 --> 24:47.985
- Neither do I.

24:47.987 --> 24:51.922
If the pregnancy led him back
here to his mother...

25:01.266 --> 25:03.033
- We need your address.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.202
- Why?
Do--do you think he's there?

25:05.204 --> 25:07.505
- You--you and Nellie
will stay here until it's safe.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.139
Detective Lindsay will be here.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.207
- Oh...

25:10.209 --> 25:13.511
- Okay, great.
Thank you.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.885
- I had him.

25:20.887 --> 25:23.621
In the woods,
I had him.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.256
If I didn't stop
for that little girl,

25:25.258 --> 25:27.157
if I kept moving
through that cabin,

25:27.159 --> 25:29.960
those four nurses
would be alive right now.

25:29.962 --> 25:33.030
- Erin, don't do this
to yourself.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.765
- That's reason number two.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.538
That's reason number one.

25:42.607 --> 25:44.742
- You're not going out, Erin.
- Why not?

25:44.744 --> 25:46.210
- This is exactly
what he wants,

25:46.212 --> 25:48.078
get in your head,
throw you off your game.

25:48.080 --> 25:52.783
- How can I be "off" my game
if you won't even let me in it?

25:52.785 --> 25:55.085
- And how am I supposed
to put you out there?

25:55.087 --> 25:57.187
You can't even
keep your cool with me.

26:00.125 --> 26:04.728
- I want to be the one
to bring him in, Hank.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.131
- You want to be the one to get
in a confrontation with him.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.699
That's not being good police.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.334
- That is not where my head
is at right now.

26:10.336 --> 26:14.038
You have my word.

26:14.040 --> 26:17.241
- I don't believe you.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.010
You're staying here.

26:46.104 --> 26:48.138
- Look, for what it's worth,

26:48.140 --> 26:51.141
if I was your sergeant,

26:51.143 --> 26:55.613
I would have done
the same thing.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.848
We'll get him.

27:25.944 --> 27:27.077
- Detective.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.013
It's my mother's.

27:29.015 --> 27:32.383
It says it's coming from me,
but I don't have my phone.

27:37.756 --> 27:39.423
<i>- Oh, it's</i>
<i>my two favorite women</i>

27:39.425 --> 27:41.825
<i>on my dear mother's phone.</i>
<i>- [groaning]</i>

27:41.827 --> 27:43.127
<i>- What are the odds?</i>

27:43.129 --> 27:45.696
- Dad?

27:50.735 --> 27:52.803
- No.
What is this?

27:52.805 --> 27:55.372
Why is he doing this?

27:55.374 --> 27:57.408
- Guard her.
Get her mother.

27:57.410 --> 27:59.810
Buzz me up.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.885
<i>- Did you think at all</i>

28:07.887 --> 28:10.821
<i>about what I said</i>
<i>about Cain and Abel?</i>

28:10.823 --> 28:14.792
<i>I mean, we've all got</i>
<i>a little murderer in us.</i>

28:14.794 --> 28:19.730
<i>It's a gift from our parents.</i>

28:19.732 --> 28:21.765
<i>Is that right, Dad?</i>

28:21.767 --> 28:25.869
<i>- [whimpers and groans]</i>

28:25.871 --> 28:28.872
<i>[heavy breathing]</i>

28:28.874 --> 28:31.875
<i>â™ª</i>

28:31.877 --> 28:33.777
- Is that why you called?

28:33.779 --> 28:36.280
To tell me that?

28:36.282 --> 28:38.282
<i>- Are you recording me again?</i>

28:38.284 --> 28:42.252
<i>You are really just begging</i>
<i>for a confession, aren't you?</i>

28:42.254 --> 28:45.322
- So are you.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.424
You want to tell the story

28:47.426 --> 28:48.892
of your sister, your mother,

28:48.894 --> 28:50.894
your father so bad,

28:50.896 --> 28:53.297
you created all of this,

28:53.299 --> 28:56.300
so start talking
or tell me where you are.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.001
<i>- [huffs]</i>

28:58.003 --> 29:00.370
<i>I knew I could</i>
<i>count on you, Detective.</i>

29:00.372 --> 29:03.407
- When we first met, you said
I reminded you of someone.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.410
<i>I'm 5'4", brunette.</i>

29:06.412 --> 29:08.946
It's your mother.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.881
<i>I remind you</i>
<i>of your mother, don't I?</i>

29:10.883 --> 29:12.850
- We'll talk about that,

29:12.852 --> 29:15.519
but let's--let's begin
with the fact

29:15.521 --> 29:18.822
that your team went
to the wrong place.

29:20.759 --> 29:21.992
- No hot spots?

29:21.994 --> 29:26.463
- Not that we can tell, Chief.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.432
- What are you doing here?

29:28.434 --> 29:30.300
- Greg Yates set this fire.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.035
Is he here?
Have you seen anything?

29:32.037 --> 29:33.504
- Call just came in
30 minutes ago.

29:33.506 --> 29:35.539
- 30?
From where?

29:35.541 --> 29:40.277
- Phone booth on the corner.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.912
- Get on the radio.
Call the unit.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.280
Text Erin.
Tell her now.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.482
- Done.

29:45.484 --> 29:46.884
<i>- Now, that will</i>
<i>be your sergeant.</i>

29:46.886 --> 29:48.452
<i>[snickering]</i>

29:48.454 --> 29:51.555
<i>Have you figured out</i>
<i>where I am yet?</i>

29:54.325 --> 29:57.494
- Yes.
<i>- Then come.</i>

29:57.496 --> 29:59.396
<i>Ooh, and we'll talk more.</i>

29:59.398 --> 30:01.865
<i>- No, no, no, no.</i>
<i>- But come alone</i>

30:01.867 --> 30:03.500
<i>or there will be another body</i>

30:03.502 --> 30:08.906
<i>to add to the list, and...</i>

30:08.908 --> 30:11.441
<i>the answer is yes.</i>

30:11.443 --> 30:15.813
<i>You do remind me of my mother.</i>

30:15.815 --> 30:18.916
<i>Right before she threw me</i>
<i>in the trash.</i>

30:31.596 --> 30:33.931
<i>- Stand down.</i>
<i>You are not going in alone.</i>

30:33.933 --> 30:35.833
<i>You hear me?</i>
<i>That's an order.</i>

30:35.835 --> 30:38.101
- He'll kill Michael Williams
if I don't show up.

30:38.103 --> 30:39.837
- That's what he wants
you to think.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.572
- It's 34th and Sangamon, Hank.

30:41.574 --> 30:43.941
It's his childhood home.
I'm almost there.

30:43.943 --> 30:46.343
- 34th?
We're five minutes away.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.312
Erin, you are not
meeting him alone.

30:48.314 --> 30:50.380
<i>You hear me?</i>
<i>Erin.</i>

30:50.382 --> 30:53.083
- You know I can't do that.

31:53.177 --> 31:55.245
[loud thud]

32:38.656 --> 32:40.590
- Detective Lindsay.

32:40.592 --> 32:43.694
So good to see you again.

32:50.435 --> 32:51.468
- Let him go.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.203
- [scoffs]

32:53.205 --> 32:56.206
I could, but I am the only thing
holding him up.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.407
- [yelps]

32:57.409 --> 33:00.077
- Let me call
an ambulance for him.

33:00.079 --> 33:03.146
Then it'll be just you and me,
just like you wanted.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.615
- No, he'll be dead
long before they get here.

33:05.617 --> 33:08.018
Put that away.

33:09.420 --> 33:12.356
Then you shoot me,
and he goes over.

33:12.358 --> 33:15.058
- [whimpers]

33:15.060 --> 33:16.026
- Stop.
- No, no, no.

33:16.028 --> 33:18.261
- Stop.

33:22.467 --> 33:24.701
This is it.

33:27.238 --> 33:29.473
- Have a seat.

33:40.051 --> 33:42.386
- Ah, oh.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.388
- Gillian Hale was
a nursing student,

33:44.390 --> 33:46.256
but what she really
wanted to be

33:46.258 --> 33:48.759
was a surgeon, a helper.

33:48.761 --> 33:52.362
Do you know
who suffers the most?

33:52.364 --> 33:53.497
Helpers,

33:53.499 --> 33:56.233
because right up
until that moment

33:56.235 --> 33:58.301
when you snap their neck,

33:58.303 --> 34:02.806
they really believe in
the goodness of people.

34:02.808 --> 34:05.442
She thought
that I would spare her

34:05.444 --> 34:07.744
because she was
three months pregnant.

34:07.746 --> 34:11.447
I mean, tha--that is
why I picked her,

34:11.449 --> 34:13.216
a pregnant nurse,

34:13.217 --> 34:15.085
as my first victim.

34:15.087 --> 34:17.487
Mm, the symmetry.

34:17.489 --> 34:21.224
You did want this
from the beginning,

34:21.226 --> 34:23.193
right, Detective?

34:33.603 --> 34:35.371
Now, my first pair, oh,

34:35.373 --> 34:39.609
that--ooh, that was electric.

34:39.610 --> 34:43.612
Lisa and, uh, oh,
Reb--Rebecca.

34:43.614 --> 34:48.351
They fought
for each other so hard,

34:48.353 --> 34:50.286
but in the end--

34:50.289 --> 34:51.554
- Ah!
Ah!

34:51.556 --> 34:53.356
- Because, you know,

34:53.358 --> 34:58.161
you can keep
a woman alive for days.

35:07.305 --> 35:08.505
<i>Oh, suffering.</i>

35:08.507 --> 35:14.311
It's such an underrated art,
isn't it?

35:14.313 --> 35:18.682
But you know who suffered

35:18.684 --> 35:21.485
the most beautifully
of them all?

35:24.489 --> 35:27.324
Poor Nadia.

35:27.326 --> 35:31.194
Look, we are so similar,

35:31.196 --> 35:32.496
you and I.

35:32.498 --> 35:35.699
Damaged by a terrible mother.

35:35.701 --> 35:38.335
A father who abandoned us

35:38.337 --> 35:41.371
when we could have saved it,

35:41.373 --> 35:43.373
and we tried to overcome,
didn't we?

35:43.375 --> 35:44.641
To become healers,

35:44.643 --> 35:47.377
but turns out,
fixing people

35:47.379 --> 35:49.779
doesn't pave over
what you're born with.

35:49.781 --> 35:52.382
- Then what do you want?

35:52.384 --> 35:57.254
Why am I here?

35:57.256 --> 35:58.722
- An execution always
needs one thing.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.824
- No.
- A witness.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.926
- No!

36:08.566 --> 36:11.368
- There's no saving people.

36:11.370 --> 36:12.769
We're killers,

36:12.771 --> 36:15.572
and at the end of the day,

36:15.574 --> 36:17.908
what is more liberating

36:17.910 --> 36:20.510
than killing someone?

36:20.512 --> 36:23.847
Bad begets bad

36:23.849 --> 36:26.316
begets bad,

36:26.318 --> 36:28.852
and you, my lovely,

36:28.854 --> 36:30.687
you get to tell this story.

36:30.689 --> 36:31.688
- Don't move.
You hear me?

36:31.690 --> 36:34.191
Stay where you are.

36:35.493 --> 36:40.697
- You write my name down
in a police report.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.799
You talk to the press.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.901
You testify in court.

36:44.903 --> 36:47.270
You are my balladeer

36:47.272 --> 36:50.807
singing the song
of Gregory Williams Yates

36:50.809 --> 36:54.678
over and over and over.

36:54.680 --> 36:55.912
- I said don't move.

36:55.914 --> 36:59.583
- You put me away.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.985
Take me in.

37:01.987 --> 37:04.588
Take me.

37:06.390 --> 37:07.524
Take me!

37:07.526 --> 37:09.226
[gunshot]

37:34.785 --> 37:36.620
<i>- We are pleased to announce</i>

37:36.622 --> 37:39.322
<i>that the extended manhunt</i>
<i>for escaped convict</i>

37:39.324 --> 37:42.759
<i>and murderer Gregory Yates</i>
<i>has come to a close.</i>

37:42.761 --> 37:45.629
At approximately 11:30 p.m.
this evening,

37:45.631 --> 37:48.331
the combined task force
located Mr. Yates

37:48.333 --> 37:50.267
at his childhood residence.

37:50.269 --> 37:54.371
<i>Yates killed Mr. Williams</i>
<i>during an extended standoff.</i>

37:54.373 --> 37:56.406
<i>He then threatened a member</i>

37:56.408 --> 37:59.409
<i>of the Chicago Police</i>
<i>Department's Intelligence Unit.</i>

37:59.411 --> 38:01.411
<i>This officer,</i>
<i>fearing for her life,</i>

38:01.413 --> 38:03.747
<i>shot and killed Yates.</i>

38:09.353 --> 38:11.655
- I need to say
that this Intelligence Unit

38:11.657 --> 38:14.524
never gave up
and never backed down.

38:14.526 --> 38:19.496
<i>This unit serves the city</i>
<i>without recognition or medals,</i>

38:19.498 --> 38:22.532
<i>but every single one of them</i>
<i>deserves our thanks tonight</i>

38:22.534 --> 38:26.036
<i>for their bravery</i>
<i>and their continued service.</i>

38:26.038 --> 38:29.539
<i>Our hearts go out to</i>
<i>the victims and their families,</i>

38:29.541 --> 38:31.775

38:31.777 --> 38:35.011
<i>for the cooperation</i>
<i>of Lieutenant Olivia Benson</i>

38:35.013 --> 38:38.081
<i>and Detective Odafin Tutuola.</i>

38:38.083 --> 38:39.816
<i>The multi-jurisdictional work</i>

38:39.818 --> 38:43.653
was instrumental
in justice being served.

38:47.758 --> 38:49.025
- You know,
what Erin went through,

38:49.027 --> 38:53.830
that can--that can screw
a person up for a while.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.098
- Well, for what it's worth,

38:55.100 --> 38:56.766
she's got me
to walk her through it.

38:56.768 --> 39:01.538
- That's not such a bad thing.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.374
- I wish you were here
more often.

39:04.376 --> 39:09.546
You'd be good for her.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.615
- Hey.

39:12.617 --> 39:14.718
- Looks like it'll be ruled
a clean kill.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.086
Fleeing felon with a weapon,
so...

39:16.088 --> 39:18.655
- [sighs]

39:24.895 --> 39:27.597
- Hey.

39:27.599 --> 39:28.932
Can I have that?

39:28.934 --> 39:30.900
- Yeah.

39:37.808 --> 39:38.808
- And you?

39:38.810 --> 39:42.779
You doing okay?

39:42.781 --> 39:45.749
- I don't know yet.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.094
- You ever heard
of William Lewis?

39:58.096 --> 40:01.831
- Yeah, he's that killer
in New York who you--

40:01.833 --> 40:03.867
- What Lewis wanted
was to get so far

40:03.869 --> 40:05.668
into his victims' heads

40:05.670 --> 40:09.773
that--that they couldn't
get rid of him.

40:09.775 --> 40:12.842
Right? That they couldn't
live the lives

40:12.844 --> 40:16.646
that they've planned.

40:16.648 --> 40:19.749
That's what
you're up against, Erin.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.824
- Is it wrong

40:27.826 --> 40:30.560
that I'm kind of relieved

40:30.562 --> 40:34.631
that I'm the one who killed him?

40:34.633 --> 40:37.033
- Greg Yates
murdered your friend.

40:37.035 --> 40:40.804
He came at you
with an ice pick.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.105
No.

40:42.107 --> 40:45.675
It's not wrong,

40:45.677 --> 40:49.045
but it doesn't mean
that you'll sleep tonight.

40:51.749 --> 40:54.184
- So what do you do?

40:54.186 --> 40:58.955
I mean, what--what did you do?

40:58.957 --> 41:03.827
- I'm still doing it.

41:03.829 --> 41:08.097
My phone is always on.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.200
Always.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.974
- Liv.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.577
- Erin.
