00:32.801 --> 00:35.065
PEGGY: Okay, I just voted.

00:35.170 --> 00:36.535
Could you see anything?

00:36.638 --> 00:38.071
Nope. Nothing.

00:38.240 --> 00:40.470
You could develop film in that booth.

00:41.476 --> 00:44.070
That's right.
Peggy Hill's garage of democracy...

00:44.179 --> 00:46.477
is gonna make those saps
in Precinct 9 wish...

00:46.581 --> 00:49.209
they'd never voted
in that stinking firehouse.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.308
Hey, Dad. Can you give me and Luanne...

00:51.420 --> 00:54.355
a ride to where Route 15 meets the 42?

00:54.489 --> 00:57.322
Why? There's nothing there
but a huge empty lot.

00:57.426 --> 01:00.918
Nuh-uh, Uncle Hank.
This week it's 20 acres of fun...

01:01.029 --> 01:02.963
and one acre of craft.

01:03.065 --> 01:05.761
At the Heimlich County Fair.

01:06.168 --> 01:08.193
Well, Luanne,
I wish you'd get this excited...

01:08.303 --> 01:11.136
about voting
in your first presidential election.

01:11.239 --> 01:14.402
Now, did you send in
those registration forms I gave you...

01:14.509 --> 01:15.908
for your eighteenth birthday?

01:16.011 --> 01:17.603
No. But that's okay.

01:17.713 --> 01:20.375
I'll just vote for president next year.

01:20.982 --> 01:21.949
[Sigh]

01:22.217 --> 01:23.650
Come on, Mom.

01:23.852 --> 01:26.582
I am not leaving
until this booth has proven to me...

01:26.688 --> 01:29.213
that it is 100% confidential.

01:29.324 --> 01:31.792
Okay. How many fingers am I holding up?

01:31.893 --> 01:35.590
Peggy, there is absolutely
no way you can see through that...

01:35.697 --> 01:36.823
Three?

01:40.402 --> 01:41.892
I was just guessing.

01:50.545 --> 01:53.776
Mom, can I have five tickets for fair food?

01:54.049 --> 01:57.576
I don't want them guessing
my weight on an empty stomach.

01:59.888 --> 02:01.219
I'm hungry, too.

02:01.323 --> 02:04.121
Luanne, you should be hungry
for democracy.

02:04.226 --> 02:06.023
Um, no.

02:06.128 --> 02:08.562
Yeah, I think I wanted the corn on a stick.

02:08.663 --> 02:11.826
Luanne, in a few years that corn'll be gone.

02:11.933 --> 02:14.697
But the thrill of voting lasts and lasts.

02:15.337 --> 02:18.329
I still get goose pimples
thinking about pulling the lever...

02:18.440 --> 02:20.305
for Councilman Fred Everett.

02:20.575 --> 02:22.440
Of course, then he betrayed me.

02:22.544 --> 02:24.512
Now, go on and register.

02:24.846 --> 02:28.373
The polls and the media
have been ignoring my campaign.

02:28.483 --> 02:31.543
But they're gonna have a little surprise
come election day...

02:31.653 --> 02:34.451
when long-shot candidate
Ted T. Ganaway...

02:34.556 --> 02:37.753
moves out of his parents' house
and into the White House!

02:37.859 --> 02:39.986
Hey, look. A fringe candidate.

02:40.162 --> 02:41.925
Poor confused bastard.

02:42.030 --> 02:44.260
Well, you have to admire his dedication.

02:44.366 --> 02:48.894
I mean, he's right here in the heart
of what I like to call "Bush Country."

02:52.307 --> 02:53.831
Hello, friends.

02:54.009 --> 02:55.636
You made eye contact.

02:55.744 --> 02:58.042
Nice job, Hank. You talk to him.

02:59.114 --> 03:02.208
My name is Ted T. Ganaway
and I'm running for president.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.749
Yeah. Well...

03:03.985 --> 03:07.887
my wife and I are pretty committed
to George W. Bush, you know.

03:08.156 --> 03:10.647
And even if we weren't, well...

03:10.759 --> 03:13.421
there's four or five candidates
ahead of you.

03:13.528 --> 03:15.826
Well, good luck with the campaign.

03:15.931 --> 03:18.627
Governor George W. Bush
and Vice President Al Gore...

03:18.733 --> 03:21.133
want you to focus
on my hit-and-run conviction...

03:21.236 --> 03:23.966
and not my sixteen-point plan for America.

03:24.072 --> 03:28.236
Dad, I know it's not up your alley,
but there's this pig named Mitch...

03:28.343 --> 03:29.571
Let's go.

03:30.979 --> 03:32.276
Welcome, folks.

03:32.380 --> 03:35.008
Y'all ready
for some world-class pig-diving?

03:36.518 --> 03:40.614
Now, before we meet our star,
let's give a county-fair howdy...

03:40.722 --> 03:42.587
to Mitch's Fishes.

03:51.633 --> 03:55.296
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you the main event...

03:55.403 --> 03:58.600
the real deal,
the finest diver with four legs...

03:58.707 --> 04:03.076
the Pork Louganis,
Mitch the Amazing Diving Pig.

04:06.514 --> 04:10.177
For his first dive,
Mitch will perform the tula-hula...

04:10.518 --> 04:13.976
a death-defying plunge through not one,
not three...

04:14.089 --> 04:15.613
but two hula hoops.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.351
Yes!

04:21.796 --> 04:24.060
That was pretty good for a pig.

04:25.033 --> 04:27.228
And now for our finale.

04:27.369 --> 04:30.998
Mitch will dive
through three rings of burning fire.

04:31.339 --> 04:34.137
It is the most difficult dive
known to man or pig.

04:34.242 --> 04:36.267
The Johnny Cash!

04:40.415 --> 04:42.212
You can do it, Mitch.

04:48.256 --> 04:50.622
I love this pig!

04:57.599 --> 04:59.567
Nothing to worry about, folks.

04:59.668 --> 05:02.262
Mitch is just hamming it up.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.630
Where is he?

05:05.140 --> 05:06.505
Where is he?

05:10.378 --> 05:12.141
Somebody do something!

05:12.747 --> 05:14.271
Oh, God! Mitch!

05:15.517 --> 05:18.042
Bobby, no! That's pig water!

05:45.213 --> 05:46.680
Mitch is dead!

05:47.716 --> 05:50.549
Not this pig, not today.

05:57.859 --> 06:00.555
Thank you, son. You saved my boy's life.

06:00.862 --> 06:02.887
- What's your name?
- Bobby Hill.

06:02.998 --> 06:05.990
Let's give a big hand to Bobby Hill...

06:06.167 --> 06:09.432
the amazing pig-saving boy!

06:21.249 --> 06:22.375
Oh, God!

06:22.484 --> 06:25.351
How much money
is it gonna take to get that film?

06:25.453 --> 06:27.717
Don't worry. I'm not with the press.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.723
I'm with the Bush-Cheney campaign.
And you must be...

06:30.825 --> 06:33.385
the amazing pig-saving boy's father.

06:33.661 --> 06:37.062
- Well. I don't...
- This is just the kind of heroism...

06:37.165 --> 06:39.827
the Governor loves to attach himself to.

06:39.968 --> 06:42.869
Why don't you all come
to his Get Out The Vote rally next week...

06:42.971 --> 06:45.599
- as our guests?
- Great.

06:45.707 --> 06:47.971
Now, if you do a background check...

06:48.076 --> 06:51.773
I'm Hank R. Hill, not that Hank P. Hill...

06:51.880 --> 06:53.871
who doesn't pay his Discover Card bill.

07:00.688 --> 07:03.680
Uncle Hank, I registered to vote.

07:03.825 --> 07:07.352
Oh, terrific. George W.'s gonna need
every vote he can get...

07:07.462 --> 07:09.487
or they won't call it a landslide.

07:09.597 --> 07:13.465
George W? He's not a communist, is he?

07:14.202 --> 07:15.897
No, he's not.

07:17.772 --> 07:19.399
Wait. Here it is.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.598
See, our candidate is Robert Parigi.

07:23.278 --> 07:25.940
What? Communist? No!

07:26.815 --> 07:29.113
I guess I cancel your vote out.

07:29.584 --> 07:32.382
My first election
and your vote means nothing.

07:35.190 --> 07:37.818
Long live the People's Revolution!

07:42.797 --> 07:44.094
HANK: What were you thinking?

07:44.199 --> 07:47.327
The Russians don't even believe
in communism anymore.

07:47.435 --> 07:49.528
You said you wanted me to vote.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.763
You sure did, Hank.

07:50.872 --> 07:53.864
Maybe Luanne has a good reason
for throwing her vote away.

07:53.975 --> 07:55.408
I've got several.

07:55.510 --> 07:58.445
First, the line at his booth
was the shortest.

07:58.546 --> 08:01.106
I like his tie. It's red.

08:01.583 --> 08:04.711
And his shirt is white.
And his jacket is blue.

08:05.019 --> 08:08.546
And that stands for America. Communism!

08:09.624 --> 08:13.060
So I see you finally got
Luanne involved in politics.

08:13.294 --> 08:14.386
That's good...

08:15.563 --> 08:16.552
ass.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.564
The people united...

08:19.801 --> 08:23.498
- Boo!
- Commie, go home!

08:24.272 --> 08:25.330
Okay.

08:27.442 --> 08:29.933
I just think
if you don't read the newspaper...

08:30.044 --> 08:32.706
and the only TV you watch is the MTV...

08:32.813 --> 08:34.577
you shouldn't be allowed to vote.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.547
Stop fighting the last war, Hank.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.518
Women got the vote
and there's nothing we can do about it.

08:39.621 --> 08:41.885
Unless...

08:42.924 --> 08:44.049
Unless what?

08:44.159 --> 08:47.060
I don't know. You're a smart guy.
You'll figure something out.

08:47.162 --> 08:48.129
[Doorbell ringing]

08:48.229 --> 08:49.594
I'll get it.

08:52.267 --> 08:53.757
LUANNE: [In English accent]
Good evening, mate.

08:54.035 --> 08:55.559
May I trouble you for a word?

08:55.670 --> 08:57.763
HANK: Oh, Lord.
PEGGY: Who is it, Hank?

08:58.039 --> 09:00.269
The Manger Babies. I'll get rid of them.

09:00.375 --> 09:02.639
Cheerio. I just wanted to tell you...

09:02.744 --> 09:06.510
you should vote for Robert Parigi
of the Communist Party USA...

09:06.614 --> 09:08.172
for President, what-what.

09:08.283 --> 09:10.581
You don't know
the first thing about communism.

09:10.685 --> 09:12.084
What's to know?

09:12.187 --> 09:16.283
Robert Parigi's got the cutest little ears
and prettiest eyebrows.

09:16.457 --> 09:19.255
So, can I tell Robert
he can count on your vote?

09:19.360 --> 09:22.693
No, you cannot. I hate communists.

09:22.864 --> 09:25.094
All they do is boss people around.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.168
Sounds like you, Uncle Hank.

09:27.335 --> 09:30.099
Luanne, please go home before I tell you...

09:30.205 --> 09:32.799
you're acting like an idiot
and make you cry.

09:33.241 --> 09:35.368
Hee-haw! You're a communist! Hee-haw!

09:35.476 --> 09:38.070
- No, I'm not!
- Welcome to the party, mate.

09:38.179 --> 09:40.306
Get that penguin back here. I'm not done.

09:40.415 --> 09:43.145
Hee-haw! Power to the people, comrade!

09:43.251 --> 09:47.017
Why, I say! You look good in red,
Comrade Hill, what-what.

09:47.121 --> 09:49.612
All right. I gave you fair warning.

09:49.724 --> 09:52.249
Luanne, you're acting like an idiot.

09:52.594 --> 09:53.822
Oh, no!

09:54.062 --> 09:56.587
Uncle Hank, no.

10:03.037 --> 10:06.234
Hank, I'm making cookies
to serve on election day.

10:06.341 --> 10:09.310
Which do you think tastes better?
The Chips Ahoy heated up...

10:09.410 --> 10:11.037
or the E.L. Fudge heated up?

10:11.145 --> 10:12.203
I don't know.

10:12.313 --> 10:13.837
Well, where is Luanne?

10:13.948 --> 10:18.180
Well, I told her she was being an idiot
and she ran off crying.

10:18.286 --> 10:19.981
Oh, Hank. Again?

10:20.088 --> 10:23.216
Well, she called me a communist
in my own home.

10:23.324 --> 10:25.952
She doesn't know what the heck
she's talking about.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.893
All right, Hank. Luanne is Cinderella.

10:29.130 --> 10:31.496
And she fell for the wrong prince.

10:31.599 --> 10:34.067
You have to be her fairy godmother...

10:34.168 --> 10:36.398
and introduce her to George W. Bush.

10:36.504 --> 10:40.133
Take her to the Bush rally,
or as I like to call it, "the ball"...

10:40.241 --> 10:42.334
and let George W. Put his issues...

10:42.443 --> 10:45.901
or as I like to call them,
"the glass slippers," on her feet.

10:46.080 --> 10:50.107
I can't bring a communist to see
the next president of the United States.

10:50.218 --> 10:52.550
Hank, if Luanne is still a communist...

10:52.654 --> 10:55.714
after hearing
the greatest orator of our day...

10:55.823 --> 10:59.919
then she really is a communist
and then we really have a problem.

11:03.798 --> 11:05.891
Hey, y'all. How're y'all doing?

11:07.468 --> 11:10.062
He's even more handsome than his dad.

11:10.305 --> 11:12.671
Well, Barbara's a handsome woman.

11:12.974 --> 11:16.466
But, you know, it's his ideas
that you'll find the most attractive.

11:16.577 --> 11:19.842
I don't know. He's really handsome.

11:20.715 --> 11:22.376
Now, I don't want any of y'all to think...

11:22.483 --> 11:24.383
Dick Cheney and I
have this thing in the bag.

11:24.485 --> 11:27.010
So, don't forget to vote on November 7.

11:28.022 --> 11:30.081
I really like his smile.

11:30.191 --> 11:32.955
And his tie. Which is red.

11:33.328 --> 11:34.795
I like red ties.

11:36.130 --> 11:38.030
Luanne, stop looking at him.

11:38.132 --> 11:40.532
Close your eyes and listen to the issues.

11:40.635 --> 11:45.072
Wait till you hear him call for lower taxes
and a stronger national defense.

11:45.173 --> 11:47.505
I just gave away the end of his speech.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.800
...and a strong national defense.

11:50.244 --> 11:54.305
God bless you and God bless
the United States of America.

12:01.022 --> 12:03.490
You know, you were right, Uncle Hank.

12:03.591 --> 12:05.081
He's gonna cut my taxes...

12:05.193 --> 12:07.627
and let me pray in junior college.

12:07.729 --> 12:09.788
I think I will vote for him.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.330
There you go.

12:16.838 --> 12:17.827
Pig boy.

12:17.939 --> 12:20.635
Pig heart-transplant boy
or pig-saving boy?

12:20.975 --> 12:23.034
- I can't remember.
- I'll wing it.

12:23.277 --> 12:26.610
Hey, there's Heimlich County's
newest hero.

12:26.714 --> 12:31.378
I was just in the right place
at the right time, like any hero.

12:31.719 --> 12:35.655
- Yeah. And I'm the boy's dad.
- And I need your vote, partner.

12:35.757 --> 12:38.225
Well, you've got it, Governor Bush.

12:43.297 --> 12:45.162
[Quizzical instrumental music]

12:46.300 --> 12:49.201
- What's wrong, Hank?
- Oh, my God!

12:50.138 --> 12:51.696
His handshake...

12:53.074 --> 12:54.371
it's limp.

12:58.679 --> 13:03.241
Did Bush's hand feel like a flounder?
Or something softer, like a jellyfish?

13:04.218 --> 13:06.448
I don't want to talk about it.

13:07.789 --> 13:11.885
Was it mushy and wet
like a handful of egg salad?

13:13.227 --> 13:16.424
It was soft and damp.
Let's just leave it at that.

13:16.531 --> 13:18.123
Was it a wriggler?

13:18.800 --> 13:22.133
Stop it. All of you, stop it.
Stop it right now!

13:22.670 --> 13:25.195
This is dead serious.
I don't know what to do.

13:25.306 --> 13:26.705
I thought I knew the man.

13:26.808 --> 13:29.834
But the man I knew
had a strong, firm grip.

13:30.011 --> 13:32.536
I thought you only cared
about the issues, Hank.

13:32.647 --> 13:34.114
Well, yeah.

13:34.382 --> 13:36.782
But a man's handshake is an issue.

13:37.084 --> 13:39.985
It's... Well, it's the character issue.

13:40.087 --> 13:43.250
No. Character is about having principles...

13:43.357 --> 13:47.521
and not sleeping with the help and such.
But a wimpy handshake...

13:47.628 --> 13:51.120
- now, that's just trivial, Hank.
- It's not trivial.

13:51.232 --> 13:54.099
This man could be the next leader
of the free world.

13:54.202 --> 13:57.638
We're gonna have nut-job third-world
dictators walking all over us...

13:57.738 --> 13:59.069
when they find out our president...

13:59.173 --> 14:02.233
doesn't have a strong enough finger
to push the button.

14:03.444 --> 14:05.241
That makes a lot of sense...

14:05.346 --> 14:06.973
a lot of nonsense.

14:10.551 --> 14:13.884
Why don't we choose the president
by lottery like they choose the pope?

14:13.988 --> 14:17.287
Don't be ridiculous.
That's how Luanne would pick a president.

14:17.391 --> 14:19.450
No dumber than a handshake.

14:19.827 --> 14:23.058
Yup. You and Luanne, two peas in a pod.

14:23.264 --> 14:24.788
All voters are the same:

14:24.899 --> 14:28.357
Simpleminded fools
who think their vote makes a difference.

14:28.469 --> 14:32.997
The system's broke, Hank. The
election baby has peed in the bathwater.

14:33.107 --> 14:35.200
You gotta throw them both out.

14:35.309 --> 14:38.836
It was a horrible, horrible,
horrible handshake.

14:39.714 --> 14:41.113
But, I don't know.

14:41.215 --> 14:44.207
Come on, Hank.
Spend tomorrow not voting with me.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.843
Every election day
I go Christmas shopping.

14:46.954 --> 14:50.287
All the suckers are at the polls.
The outlet malls are empty.

14:50.658 --> 14:53.991
The parking lots are full,
which I never understood.

14:54.095 --> 14:57.531
I got a theory,
but it involves the largest mirror in Texas.

14:57.632 --> 14:59.429
No, no. I've got to vote.

14:59.534 --> 15:02.662
- So, you're voting for the other fellow?
- I don't know.

15:02.770 --> 15:07.139
All I know is if I don't vote,
I won't get called for jury duty anymore.

15:11.512 --> 15:14.970
Hank, honey, if you have to go into
the garage, please walk on the stripes.

15:15.082 --> 15:18.711
- The stars will not be dry until morning.
- Look, look. Right there.

15:18.819 --> 15:22.516
See that guy's reaction
when Bush shakes his hand? Surprise...

15:23.057 --> 15:24.524
then disappointment.

15:24.625 --> 15:27.185
Sure. But when I want to watch
Scent of a Woman...

15:27.295 --> 15:29.320
you don't even know
how to work the VCR.

15:29.430 --> 15:32.695
See, the guy's smiling, happy,
on top of the world.

15:33.067 --> 15:35.399
Then Bush shakes,
there goes the man's face.

15:35.503 --> 15:38.700
See? Surprise, then disappointment.
See that?

15:40.841 --> 15:43.241
Surprise, then disappointment.

15:43.878 --> 15:46.244
Surprise, then disappointment.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.982
Surprise, then disappointment.

15:49.250 --> 15:52.777
Hank, honey, thanks for making
your side of the bed this morning.

15:52.987 --> 15:55.649
It saved me lots of time. Hank?

15:57.692 --> 16:00.286
You know, with voter turnout
at all-time lows...

16:00.394 --> 16:02.589
not voting makes me more American.

16:02.697 --> 16:05.097
The only thing more American
than not voting...

16:05.199 --> 16:09.329
is Egyptian cotton/linen irregulars
at 40% off.

16:09.437 --> 16:11.837
DALE: First stop, Wamsutta sheets.

16:14.108 --> 16:16.576
Mrs. Fedder, what time do you have?

16:16.944 --> 16:19.208
- A little before 7:00.
- I have 7:00.

16:19.814 --> 16:21.873
It's still a little before 7:00.

16:25.319 --> 16:29.153
On three, two, one, now.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.124
Now!

16:35.830 --> 16:36.990
Hi, Peggy.

16:37.298 --> 16:39.459
First to vote, last to leave.

16:43.204 --> 16:46.867
And the pockets are big enough
for an umbrella.

16:49.410 --> 16:51.139
Joseph will love it.

16:54.815 --> 16:56.806
I look like a jackass.

16:58.619 --> 17:00.086
Look at that.

17:01.389 --> 17:05.257
Well, I'm ready to vote.
Where's Uncle Hank?

17:05.726 --> 17:07.955
I wanted us to vote at the same time.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.555
He and Dale went down
to that outlet mall.

17:10.665 --> 17:12.633
You know, the one next door to Mexico.

17:12.733 --> 17:16.328
Well, he'll be back before the polls close,
won't he?

17:17.171 --> 17:18.661
Oh, no, no, no.

17:19.106 --> 17:21.665
But that's okay. Hank says he's not voting.

17:26.079 --> 17:29.379
Smell this, Hank.
Does it smell like Boomhauer?

17:30.084 --> 17:33.315
Yeah, it smells like Boomhauer.
He's gonna love it.

17:33.421 --> 17:34.820
[Pager beeping]

17:34.955 --> 17:37.287
This could be a propane emergency.

17:37.391 --> 17:39.552
No. Just Luanne...

17:39.694 --> 17:41.685
or one of her Manger Babies.

17:41.796 --> 17:43.093
So, where to, Dale?

17:43.197 --> 17:46.462
Well, Nancy's been wanting
an onyx chessboard...

17:46.567 --> 17:48.262
and I know just the place.

17:48.502 --> 17:52.563
I think Uncle Hank is dead!
He didn't return my page.

17:52.673 --> 17:54.664
Well, I am sure he's not dead, Luanne.

17:54.775 --> 17:57.539
That number is for
propane emergencies only.

18:01.515 --> 18:03.710
Dale, this bridge goes into Mexico.

18:03.818 --> 18:07.948
Did I make a wrong turn?
All right. Let me try to spin around.

18:08.522 --> 18:11.116
Nope. Not yet.

18:11.826 --> 18:13.418
Now? Nope.

18:13.694 --> 18:16.686
Oh, well, we're in Mexico.
What are you gonna do?

18:16.797 --> 18:18.697
Dang it, Dale. Turn around up here.

18:18.799 --> 18:22.064
No. There is to be no deviation
from the plan.

18:22.570 --> 18:24.697
- What plan?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

18:24.805 --> 18:27.399
We're gonna spend
the rest of the day in Mexico...

18:27.508 --> 18:29.237
see how the election turns out.

18:29.343 --> 18:32.744
If there's any problem,
civil unrest, military coup...

18:33.080 --> 18:36.243
we will remain in Mexico
under assumed identities.

18:36.383 --> 18:39.750
You are Fritz Krueger:
Wealthy Ecuadorian rancher.

18:39.987 --> 18:44.515
And I am Central American
singing sensation Lamotil.

18:44.825 --> 18:48.921
You know I'm not Ecuadorian.
So why would I need Ecuadorian papers?

18:49.130 --> 18:50.791
You're already not voting.

18:50.898 --> 18:53.332
You might as well give up
your citizenship.

18:53.434 --> 18:56.062
Believe me, Hank,
if things go sour up north...

18:56.170 --> 18:59.367
you'll be happy you're
a non-naturalized resident alien in Mexico.

18:59.473 --> 19:00.440
[Pager beeping]

19:01.375 --> 19:05.072
It's Rudy at Goobersmooches.
Now, believe me, this is serious.

19:05.179 --> 19:08.171
He doesn't just call to chat.
We have nothing in common.

19:15.990 --> 19:17.821
- Goobersmooches.
- Rudy?

19:17.925 --> 19:20.223
No, it's Luanne Platter.

19:20.661 --> 19:23.061
And it's not a propane emergency.

19:23.297 --> 19:25.765
It's a "Why aren't you voting emergency?"

19:25.866 --> 19:27.424
Why aren't you voting?

19:27.868 --> 19:31.031
Because my candidate's handshake
had no character.

19:31.405 --> 19:34.067
But Hank's character is to vote anyways...

19:34.175 --> 19:37.110
even if it's rainy, or your face is splotchy...

19:37.211 --> 19:40.612
or your uncle made you cry,
or your candidate's a dud.

19:40.781 --> 19:43.079
It doesn't take any character to give up.

19:43.184 --> 19:45.345
What do you know?
You've never even voted.

19:45.452 --> 19:49.684
Well, maybe I won't vote after all,
since apparently it's not that important.

19:50.024 --> 19:52.822
I think I'll go shopping,
just like you did, Uncle Hank.

19:52.927 --> 19:56.886
Because I don't need to vote, but I
can always use a good pair of pants.

19:59.800 --> 20:03.031
Luanne, I want you to meet me
at our polling place.

20:03.237 --> 20:06.104
And I'll give you the pants
I just bought you for Christmas.

20:06.574 --> 20:08.974
Dale, can I see your keys for a second?

20:09.076 --> 20:12.671
- Why?
- It was supposed to be a surprise.

20:12.780 --> 20:17.114
But I bought you
a leather key chain at the Coach outlet...

20:17.218 --> 20:19.448
and I wanted to make sure it fits.

20:19.553 --> 20:23.751
When did you do that?
When I was trying on underwear?

20:25.259 --> 20:28.786
Wait a minute.
You know I don't like key chains.

20:29.396 --> 20:32.991
- What did you get me? A money clip?
- Keep guessing.

20:33.534 --> 20:34.967
DALE: Kenneth Cole shoes?

20:35.169 --> 20:36.693
A new spaghetti pot?

20:36.937 --> 20:38.564
A leather backpack?

20:38.706 --> 20:40.469
Something with leather?

20:45.145 --> 20:46.737
Come on.

20:50.384 --> 20:51.976
Sir, do you know
how fast you were going?

20:52.086 --> 20:55.749
Yeah. Eighty-six miles per hour.
Now, would you mind writing this up fast?

20:55.856 --> 20:58.825
I've got to get home
before the polls close. I've got to vote.

20:58.926 --> 21:00.257
You haven't voted?

21:00.361 --> 21:02.124
DALE: A Namby ice bucket?

21:02.396 --> 21:04.796
Cap snaffler? Total Gym?

- How much time do we have?
- One minute.

21:15.676 --> 21:18.611
- I have two minutes.
- One minute.

21:38.198 --> 21:41.395
- So, who'd you vote for, Hank?
- No.
