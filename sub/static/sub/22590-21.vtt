<i>NARRATOR". Gotham State Prison,
a grim and foreboding edifice.</i>

00:15.350 --> 00:21.064
<i>It, like politics, has been the last refuge
of many a scoundrel.</i>

00:21.731 --> 00:25.401
<i>Including that criminal cowpoke Shame.</i>

00:26.486 --> 00:28.613
Now, don't you fret none, Shame, honey.

00:28.821 --> 00:31.699
We is gonna get you sprung right quick.

00:32.659 --> 00:33.952
I don't understand.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.038
We assembled us a gang on the outside...

00:37.247 --> 00:43.044
...and as soon as you show them law men
your backside, you're all set for funning again.

00:43.461 --> 00:47.590
Well, I appreciate it mighty much,
Frontier Fanny and Calamity Jan.

00:48.341 --> 00:52.262
But I find this here hoosegow's
tighter than a New England banker.

00:52.762 --> 00:57.308
I likewise opine it'd take more than
a pack of wild horses to get me out of here.

00:57.517 --> 01:03.606
You just mosey on by the left wall
of this here pokey about 15 past five.

01:03.815 --> 01:07.277
And 325 wild horses will meet you.

01:17.245 --> 01:22.041
Now you just keep a tight rein, and hold on
to your saddle horn, Shame, honey.

01:22.667 --> 01:26.254
That kiss is just a down payment
on what you're due.

01:29.465 --> 01:30.592
Good.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.272
Nice timepiece you have there, Shame.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.608
Yeah, got it off a railroad man.

01:46.816 --> 01:49.402
They gave it to him
for 50 years' dedicated service.

01:49.652 --> 01:52.113
- What did you give him for it?
-Three bullets.

01:52.614 --> 01:53.740
In the head.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.965
Yeah, you done do'd it, honey.

02:11.633 --> 02:13.635
All right, let's point our toe and go.

02:13.843 --> 02:17.055
We got 325 wild horses
under this here hood.

02:17.263 --> 02:21.017
Yeah, I gotta hand it to you, Calamity.
You're a woman and a half.

02:21.225 --> 02:23.353
If you could just get rid of the other half.

02:50.129 --> 02:52.215
Mm-mm.

02:54.717 --> 02:57.929
Ah. Excellent fondue, Barbara. Mm.

02:58.137 --> 03:00.473
Not often a bachelor gets a
good home-cooked meal.

03:00.682 --> 03:03.893
Well, it isn't often
a spinster gets to cook for a bachelor.

03:06.521 --> 03:07.605
Hello.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.650
Yes. It's for you, Daddy.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.318
<i>Hmm'? Oh.</i>

03:12.527 --> 03:14.779
Ahem. Thank you. Commissioner Gordon.

03:15.738 --> 03:19.075
What, Chief O'Hara?
Oh, yes. I'll take care of it right away.

03:19.283 --> 03:23.246
Hold your phone up next to the Batphone,
and put me through to you-know-who.

03:23.454 --> 03:24.831
What's the matter?

03:25.039 --> 03:27.250
Shame, that monstrous
maverick of malfeasance...

03:27.458 --> 03:29.335
...has made good his threat to come back.

03:35.508 --> 03:38.511
That's the signal for the Bat-answer-phone
to be put into action.

03:47.854 --> 03:49.439
Yes, commissioner?

03:49.647 --> 03:50.898
Dreadful news, Batman.

03:51.107 --> 03:52.734
<i>Exactly what's wrong, commissioner?</i>

03:52.942 --> 03:56.654
Shame has just fled Gotham City State Prison.
Can you meet me in my office?

03:56.863 --> 03:59.198
<i>We'll be right there, commissioner.</i>

04:00.825 --> 04:04.120
I must beg your forgiveness, Barbara,
Bruce, but duty calls.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.290
Yes, I think
I should run along as well, Barbara.

04:07.498 --> 04:11.085
Uh, it wouldn't be proper for the two of us
to be here alone...

04:11.294 --> 04:13.379
...in your apartment without a chaperone.

04:15.673 --> 04:18.134
But what about my fondue?

05:46.305 --> 05:49.851
They were last seen going north
on the highway in the stolen tank.

05:50.059 --> 05:52.311
Where in the world did they ever get a tank?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.814
Madman Otto's Used Tank Lot. Heh.

05:56.315 --> 05:57.483
Is he mad now.

06:00.653 --> 06:01.863
Yes.

06:02.071 --> 06:04.532
We're doing all we can, Mayor Linseed.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.701
Oh, that's good news.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.828
Thank you, sir, for calling.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.290
- They found the tank on West 20th Street.
-Is it still there?

06:12.498 --> 06:14.834
No, they towed it,
the parking meter had run out.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.753
They probably removed
the fingerprints as well.

06:17.962 --> 06:22.091
I think Mayor Linseed should make
some changes in his towing policy.

06:24.093 --> 06:25.136
Yes, Bonnie.

06:25.344 --> 06:27.889
<i>There's something in the outer office for you.</i>

06:28.097 --> 06:30.558
Exactly what, Bonnie,
we're quite busy, you know.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.227
- A horse.
-A horse?

06:33.436 --> 06:36.647
- Oh. Chief O'Hara, see what it's all about.
-Right.

06:38.399 --> 06:42.820
Tanks in the street,
a horse in my outer office...

06:43.029 --> 06:45.573
Has the whole world gone batty?

06:48.200 --> 06:51.871
Just an expression, Batman.
No slight intended.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.956
I understand.

06:57.919 --> 07:00.630
This is what she meant, commissioner.
A saw horse.

07:00.838 --> 07:04.550
And there's a note attached to it
addressed to Batman.

07:07.178 --> 07:09.221
It's from Shame.

07:10.306 --> 07:16.103
"I hereby am telling you...

07:16.312 --> 07:20.483
...that I'm a gonna rob
the Gotham City Stage...

07:20.691 --> 07:23.277
...at 8:45 tonight.

07:23.986 --> 07:28.824
I'm gonna steal a rock and a roll.

07:29.033 --> 07:31.452
I dares you...

07:31.661 --> 07:37.041
...to figure it out, Dynamic Dumb-Dumb...

07:37.249 --> 07:40.628
...best regards, your enemy Shame."

07:40.836 --> 07:44.924
It's full of misspellings,
and I'm full of misgivings.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.425
Holy gall.

07:48.052 --> 07:49.261
Hi, everybody.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.722
Well, this certainly looks
like a gathering of a clan.

07:51.931 --> 07:54.100
- Ha, ha.
- What's up?

07:54.308 --> 07:57.186
Shame is up. To no good.
He's had the indecent effrontery...

07:57.395 --> 08:00.856
...to tell us what he's going to steal
and where he's going to steal it.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.151
Sounds like a very cooperative
arch-criminal to me.

08:06.195 --> 08:07.488
Why all the consternation?

08:07.989 --> 08:11.033
Because none of us can figure out
what he's talking about.

08:11.242 --> 08:14.870
Perhaps a session with the Batcomputer
will aid us in our quest, Robin.

08:15.079 --> 08:20.001
We'll be in touch as soon
as we figure out this mystifying missive.

08:20.251 --> 08:21.711
Let's go, Robin.

08:25.798 --> 08:29.260
<i>NARRATOR". A short while later,
under the cover of darkness...</i>

08:29.468 --> 08:31.804
<i>...Shame and his cohorts are holed up...</i>

08:32.013 --> 08:36.225
<i>...in Gotham City's Central Park Stables.</i>

08:46.694 --> 08:48.279
Ah.

08:49.196 --> 08:53.492
Well, that's a mighty fine looking gang
you rounded up there, Calamity Jan.

08:53.701 --> 08:58.873
Shame, honey, this here's
Fernando Ricardo Enrique Dominguez.

08:59.081 --> 09:02.084
We calls him "Fred" for short,
because it's his initials.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.419
Howdy.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.921
The pleasure is entirely mine,
you may be sure.

09:06.839 --> 09:08.799
And this here's Chief Standing Pat.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.431
That means:

09:15.639 --> 09:19.685
"it's gonna be great working with you, and
I hope to get to know you better real soon."

09:19.894 --> 09:21.437
You got all that from one puff?

09:21.645 --> 09:22.938
He talks in shorthand.

09:23.147 --> 09:26.108
Good. All right, now, here's the nitty-gritty.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.695
We're gonna--

09:29.945 --> 09:31.655
We're gonna--

09:32.823 --> 09:34.992
We're gonna knock off the Dynamic Duo.

09:35.201 --> 09:37.495
- And Batgirl.
-And Batgirl.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.622
And then we're gonna do something...

09:39.830 --> 09:43.667
...which I like to refer to as, uh,
"The Great Train Robbery."

09:43.876 --> 09:46.128
That's scarcely original, you know.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.715
A big mouth is better when it's shut, Fred.

09:49.924 --> 09:53.385
So keep your tongue harnessed,
and you'll have a thin lip.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.513
I stand chastised.

09:55.721 --> 09:56.764
Good.

09:56.972 --> 10:00.059
Now, you two characters
from an old-time Western movie...

10:00.267 --> 10:04.980
...I want you to go out and case the stage,
because we're gonna lift the rock and a roll.

10:05.189 --> 10:07.149
Now, that's part one of my caper.

10:07.858 --> 10:10.444
But we can't get to part two...

10:10.653 --> 10:13.697
...before we've done part one.

10:14.949 --> 10:18.035
- Does that make sense to you?
-Your lucidity is surpassed...

10:18.244 --> 10:21.747
...only by your remarkable command
and penchant for gibberish.

10:22.081 --> 10:23.624
Well, thanks, Fred.

10:23.833 --> 10:26.127
That's mighty nice of you.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.045
We're gonna be good buddies. Now...

10:28.254 --> 10:31.340
...we're gonna meet, rendezvous, at 8:30...

10:31.549 --> 10:34.135
...savvy?
-Savvy.

10:36.387 --> 10:38.806
- That means, uh--
-Good.

10:39.014 --> 10:43.394
Okay, now you characters get because
me and my girl got a little sparking to do.

10:43.936 --> 10:44.979
Cheerio.

11:06.584 --> 11:08.294
Is there something I can do for you?

11:08.502 --> 11:13.174
You can't get closer than two feet
until a marriage is arranged.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.968
Oh, Ma. Have a heart.

11:16.177 --> 11:21.223
A mother can't hardly have a heart
where her daughter is concerned.

11:23.893 --> 11:25.603
I've got it.

11:25.936 --> 11:28.022
What do criminals call a "rock"?

11:28.230 --> 11:29.940
Holy carats. A diamond.

11:30.149 --> 11:31.650
Exactly, Robin.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.360
Now...

11:34.320 --> 11:37.364
...what do they call a "roll"?

11:37.573 --> 11:39.658
- It might be a bank roll.
-Right again, Robin.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.036
But where is the Gotham City Stage?

11:44.663 --> 11:46.874
- Yes, commissioner?
-Batman, this is Batgirl.

11:47.082 --> 11:49.251
I figured out where
the Gotham City Stage is...

11:49.460 --> 11:52.546
...but I can't make heads or tails
about the "rock" and the "roll."

11:52.755 --> 11:55.341
We obviously need each other, Batgirl.

11:56.842 --> 12:00.012
Meet me at the corner of 61st Street
and Washington Avenue.

12:00.221 --> 12:02.848
<i>- We'll talk then.
-Oh, yes.</i>

12:06.560 --> 12:08.771
Well, hello, Barbara.

12:08.979 --> 12:12.775
To what do I owe the honor of this
unexpected, but nevertheless welcome visit?

12:12.983 --> 12:16.320
I have two tickets to the opera.
I thought you might like to be my date.

12:16.528 --> 12:21.617
Oh, I'll have to beg off, darling. There's no time
for cultural pursuits with Shame on the loose.

12:21.825 --> 12:24.995
Why don't you phone
millionaire Bruce Wayne?

12:25.204 --> 12:27.206
Daddy, now how would that look?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.291
I don't want to appear too eager.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.168
No, I understand.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.672
'Bye-bye.
-Bye.

12:39.176 --> 12:41.971
- Yes, Batman.
-May I speak with Batgirl, commissioner?

12:42.179 --> 12:44.723
I neglected to ask her
which corner we meet on.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.225
Batgirl?

12:46.433 --> 12:49.561
But you must be mistaken,
Batman. She's not here.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.855
And as far as I know, she hasn't been here.

12:52.064 --> 12:53.357
Thank you, commissioner.

12:55.693 --> 12:57.695
How does she do it?

12:57.903 --> 13:00.656
A moment ago,
I spoke to Batgirl on that Batphone.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.242
Now the commissioner tells me
she wasn't even there.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.120
I don't think we should even
attempt to fathom it, Batman.

13:06.328 --> 13:10.249
She treasures her own anonymity
every bit as much as we treasure ours.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.126
Of course. You're right, Robin.

13:12.334 --> 13:13.544
Still...

13:13.752 --> 13:16.463
Well, there's just no time. Let's go, Robin.

13:19.425 --> 13:22.594
<i>NARRATOR". As Batman and Robin hurry
to their appointment...</i>

13:22.803 --> 13:26.473
<i>...Barbara Gordon transforms
herself into Batgirl...</i>

13:26.682 --> 13:32.187
<i>...scourge of Gotham City's underworld
and defender of truth and justice.</i>

13:32.688 --> 13:35.858
<i>But are their actions too late to stop Shame...</i>

13:36.066 --> 13:39.194
<i>...from robbing the Gotham City
Stage of a rock and roll?</i>

13:39.403 --> 13:42.698
<i>The answer in one breathless minute.</i>

13:47.578 --> 13:49.163
<i>NARRATOR".
Gotham City Opera House...</i>

13:49.371 --> 13:53.542
<i>...where a handful of unlikely visitors
are already backstage.</i>

13:59.173 --> 14:01.175
Yeah. This must be the place, all right.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.552
You can't come in here.

14:03.761 --> 14:05.721
Says who, short stuff?

14:06.096 --> 14:08.891
Well, says me. I'm Pop, the stage doorman.

14:09.099 --> 14:13.437
Pop? You ain't old enough to
drink pop, far less be called it.

14:13.645 --> 14:16.732
Well, I'm 17, and it's a time-honored
theatrical tradition...

14:16.940 --> 14:20.611
...that no matter how old or young
a stage doorman is, his name has to be "Pop."

14:21.528 --> 14:23.655
Well, good night, Pop.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.116
"Good night"?
I'm not going to sleep for hours.

14:26.325 --> 14:27.743
Wanna bet?

14:33.332 --> 14:36.210
I assumed that Shame meant
the Gotham City Opera House stage...

14:36.418 --> 14:38.629
<i>...in that The Girl of the Golden West opens.</i>

14:38.837 --> 14:40.047
That's a good assumption.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.925
I know for a fact that
the two leading singers in that production...

14:43.133 --> 14:47.012
...have strange quirks, which Shame probably
knew when he talked of a rock and roll.

14:47.221 --> 14:48.263
Such as?

14:48.472 --> 14:51.225
Leonora Sotto Voce,
world's leading soprano...

14:51.433 --> 14:55.854
...who never goes on stage without
wearing her 283 karat diamond-pendant.

14:56.063 --> 15:01.110
And Fortissimo Fra Diavolo, who always
carries $20,000 in cash in his pockets for luck.

15:01.318 --> 15:02.528
Let's go.

15:03.779 --> 15:08.700
I don't understand it. Every time I begin
my aria, you're upstaging me.

15:08.909 --> 15:13.997
- Always upstaging me.
-It isn't a case of upstaging you, Fortissimo.

15:14.331 --> 15:19.586
There are two leading singers
in this opera but only one great voice.

15:19.795 --> 15:21.422
Mine.

15:21.630 --> 15:25.717
All right. Can that palabra, lady.
Keep yourself planted to the stage.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.719
You too, Caruso.

15:27.928 --> 15:31.640
Get the diva's diamond, Fred.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.310
Come on. Get these folks'...

15:35.561 --> 15:37.646
- What are you doing?
- Hush up.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.694
Shame on you, Shame.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.739
Unhand them, you fiend.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.074
All right.

15:49.283 --> 15:50.409
You.

17:31.593 --> 17:34.888
Hey, here comes my women's auxiliary.

17:45.691 --> 17:47.609
That's all right, Frontier Fanny.

17:47.818 --> 17:50.445
Kissing don't really count
when it's through the cloth.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.413
How do you like that, Batbrats?

18:00.872 --> 18:02.833
What have you done to us, Shame?

18:03.041 --> 18:05.836
I gave you a dose of fear gas.

18:06.044 --> 18:08.547
- A dose of what?
- A dose of fear gas.

18:08.755 --> 18:12.301
From now on, you'll be scared of everything,
you cowardly caped crusaders.

18:12.509 --> 18:16.179
- Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt us.
-Oh, spare our lives, kind sir.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.515
We'd do the same for you. Honest. Honest.

18:18.724 --> 18:19.933
Honest, we would.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.518
Yeah. I reckon I would.

18:21.727 --> 18:23.520
I ain't all bad. Just boastly.

18:23.729 --> 18:25.439
- Stand in front of me, Batgirl.
-No!

18:25.689 --> 18:29.026
Chief, we'll take the Batgirl.
That way the police won't bother us none.

18:29.234 --> 18:32.070
Don't worry about them other two.
Ain't worth a heck of darn.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.866
- Take her, take her. She's yours.
- Bring her along.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.953
All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

18:41.288 --> 18:44.082
How do you like that, scaredy bats?

18:45.917 --> 18:49.463
Hey, Fred. Did you hear that?
That's pretty good. "Scaredy bats."

18:50.714 --> 18:52.591
Good, good. They took the girl.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.593
Not us.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.556
Robin.

18:59.765 --> 19:01.224
What is this?

19:01.433 --> 19:04.353
- What are you trying to do?
-it's probably poison.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.730
He wants to see us dead.
He's always hated us.

19:07.105 --> 19:09.900
Yes, he has. You're right, Robin.

19:10.442 --> 19:13.612
- You're not to be trusted either, Boy Wonder.
-Well, neither are you.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.781
Come, come, Master Robin. Really, sir.

19:16.198 --> 19:21.203
Alleviate your tensions. This broth is
composed of two parts chicken soup...

19:21.411 --> 19:24.539
...and one part bat-antidote powder.
-I wonder.

19:24.748 --> 19:28.752
It's, uh, to counteract the terrible
effects of the fear gas.

19:29.127 --> 19:31.254
You need have no trepidation.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.384
What's that beeping?

19:35.592 --> 19:37.052
I'll take it, sir.

19:37.761 --> 19:40.472
- Yes, commissioner?
-May I speak with Batman, please?

19:41.223 --> 19:43.100
I'm afraid he's indisposed.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.352
Well, then give him these messages.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.980
The newspapers and the state hierarchy
are clamoring for an arrest.

19:49.189 --> 19:52.234
And furthermore, in addition
to Batgirl being kidnapped...

19:52.442 --> 19:55.654
...my own daughter, Barbara,
is nowhere to be found.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.532
I'll certainly transmit your message, sir.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.242
Yes, Alfred?

20:00.450 --> 20:05.497
You best get going, sir. It appears that the
mayor and the governor are in a bit of a snit.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.166
Feeling better, sir?

20:08.375 --> 20:10.502
Yes, but there seems to be...

20:10.711 --> 20:13.338
...a slight residue of fear left.

20:13.547 --> 20:16.842
However, I must shunt this aside...

20:17.050 --> 20:18.093
...and press on.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.929
- Let's go, Robin.
-Uh, where?

20:21.138 --> 20:22.389
Hmm, yes, where?

20:22.597 --> 20:27.060
We've learned from past experience that
Shame is happiest when he's around horses.

20:27.269 --> 20:30.647
Now, where would we find horses
in the heart of Gotham City?

20:30.856 --> 20:32.441
Uh, the Police Riding Academy.

20:32.649 --> 20:36.278
No, no, no. Shame wouldn't be that
brazen to hide at a police stable.

20:36.486 --> 20:40.073
But there is one place he might be.

20:40.282 --> 20:43.493
Holy hoof beats, the
Gotham Central Park Stables.

20:43.702 --> 20:45.579
Across the street from the opera house.

20:45.787 --> 20:47.164
Let's go, Robin.

20:49.624 --> 20:52.252
Now, here's a plan.

20:54.129 --> 20:56.047
Here's our plan.

20:56.548 --> 21:02.512
You take this grub-steak out,
and buy a acetylene torch and a drill.

21:02.846 --> 21:07.726
Why don't we merely purloin those items
instead of purchase them?

21:08.518 --> 21:11.521
Because it don't pay none, Fred.

21:11.730 --> 21:14.691
It don't pay none to risk getting
caught over small potatoes.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.903
Besides, I need you for
the great train-robbery.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.491
You sure he's Mexican?

21:22.699 --> 21:25.786
You make good squaw.

21:26.161 --> 21:28.580
Plenty of meat.

21:28.789 --> 21:31.875
And you make good rug.

21:33.835 --> 21:37.506
Ah, boy. That old Fanny's a
hundred laughs, ain't she?

21:37.714 --> 21:41.927
Oh, Shame, honey. Can't you just
picture how happy we're gonna be?

21:42.135 --> 21:43.804
- Yeah.
-You and Ma and me...

21:44.012 --> 21:46.473
...living on our own spread
west of Laramie...

21:46.681 --> 21:49.226
...where the air is clear and smog-free...

21:49.434 --> 21:54.648
...and the corn is as high as Chief Standing
Pat's eye. Can't you just picture it?

21:54.856 --> 21:57.275
I'm picturing about two-thirds of it.

21:57.567 --> 22:00.195
All right. Let's see how little
old Batchick's doing.

22:00.403 --> 22:04.032
- Hello, Batchick.
-I think you're caring too much about her.

22:04.241 --> 22:06.368
I'm for ventilating her head
and leaving her.

22:06.576 --> 22:09.162
Just simmer down, woman. Simmer down.

22:09.371 --> 22:10.789
She's our insurance policy.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.084
Long as she's breathing this
Gotham City stuff they pass for air...

22:14.292 --> 22:16.378
...nobody's gonna stampede us.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.046
Besides...

22:18.255 --> 22:21.383
...you know, it's you.

22:22.259 --> 22:24.302
And only you.

22:26.137 --> 22:28.098
And me.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.477
And only me.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.902
Why couldn't you been born an orphan?

22:43.238 --> 22:46.408
Oh. Good. Good.

22:46.616 --> 22:49.661
Got the drill? Good. All right. Now let's get.

22:49.870 --> 22:50.954
- Shame, honey.
-Yeah.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.540
- You ain't worried none.
-No, I ain't worried.

22:53.748 --> 22:58.753
As long as I got that horseshoe up there.
That's a sign of good luck.

22:58.962 --> 23:02.549
Okay. We're riding high and hog. Let's go.

23:02.757 --> 23:04.968
Come on, pussycat. Come on.

23:05.176 --> 23:07.178
Get up now. Get up.

23:34.039 --> 23:36.750
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.835
Look.

23:40.837 --> 23:43.632
It's Frontier Fanny, Calamity Jan's mother.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.842
They're got Batgirl, and we've got Fanny.

23:46.051 --> 23:48.970
It hardly seems like a
fair trade, does it, Robin?

23:49.721 --> 23:50.931
What do we do now, Batman?

23:51.556 --> 23:54.893
I wish I knew, Robin. I wish I knew.

23:55.185 --> 23:57.896
With Batgirl in the clutches
of that frontier felon...

23:58.104 --> 24:01.733
...who knows what disaster awaits
her or all of Gotham City.

24:02.817 --> 24:04.569
On your feet.

24:05.570 --> 24:08.698
- All right. Where did Shame go?
-What's he going to do with Batgirl?

24:08.907 --> 24:11.910
- Wouldn't you like to know.
-Yes, we would like to know.

24:12.118 --> 24:15.830
Well, I'll tell you this, dynamic dummies.

24:16.039 --> 24:20.669
Do anything to me, and Batgirl's chances
of living through the night...

24:20.877 --> 24:24.506
...ain't worth a pitcher of warm tears.

24:24.714 --> 24:27.467
I never met a person
I didn't like, Frontier Fanny.

24:27.676 --> 24:30.136
But in this case, I may
have to make an exception.

24:30.345 --> 24:33.390
<i>NARRATOR". Have Batman and Robin
been hornswoggled?</i>

24:33.598 --> 24:36.893
<i>Watch the next episode
for the thrilling conclusion.</i>
