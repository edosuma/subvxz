WEBVTT

00:02.213 --> 00:04.257
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:04.281 --> 00:05.658
- You sleep down here? You okay?
- Whoooo!

00:05.682 --> 00:08.067
Yeah, um, shouldn't have had
that last drink.

00:08.090 --> 00:10.269
It kicked in my insomnia.

00:10.293 --> 00:12.073
All right, well, I'll make us coffee.

00:12.097 --> 00:14.540
- Okay.
- Hey, uh, my uncle messaged.

00:14.564 --> 00:15.841
He wants to know if we wanna go

00:15.865 --> 00:17.843
to Mackinac Island next weekend.

00:17.867 --> 00:19.211
What do you think about that?

00:19.235 --> 00:22.037
- Can we go now?
- Oh, I wish.

00:28.578 --> 00:30.389
New poll came out.

00:30.893 --> 00:32.861
Kelton's 20 points out in front.

00:33.216 --> 00:36.595
Well, good-bye, Intelligence.
Hello, 16th district.

00:36.619 --> 00:38.864
Why would he send you to the 16th?

00:38.888 --> 00:41.067
Because he's gonna send
the South-siders North

00:41.091 --> 00:42.568
and North-siders South.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.371
He's gonna separate the units.

00:45.395 --> 00:46.872
Send us to all parts of the city.

00:46.896 --> 00:48.641
Well, Kelton wants his own people close.

00:48.665 --> 00:50.242
It sucks but you would do the same thing.

00:50.266 --> 00:52.586
Break up the team with the
highest clear rate in the city?

00:52.610 --> 00:53.871
No, I would not.

00:56.239 --> 00:57.650
What?

00:57.674 --> 00:59.218
You're adorable when you're stubborn.

00:59.242 --> 01:00.653
I'm not stubborn. I'm right.

01:00.677 --> 01:02.455
Again, proving my point.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.724
<i>Units in the 9th district
and units on the city-wide,</i>

01:04.748 --> 01:06.225
<i>we have an armed robbery in progress</i>

01:06.249 --> 01:07.893
<i>at 730 West on 31st.</i>

01:07.917 --> 01:09.795
730 West, that's a couple
of blocks from here.

01:09.819 --> 01:12.398
5021 Henry, we're gonna roll on that.

01:16.326 --> 01:19.405
5021 Henry on the scene,
call's bona fide.

01:19.429 --> 01:21.173
We have a man down.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.581
Chicago PD!

01:28.605 --> 01:30.616
Let's see your hands!

01:30.640 --> 01:32.585
Get your hands in the air now!

01:32.609 --> 01:34.854
Listen, pal, you back away from the van!

01:34.878 --> 01:37.289
Keep your hands where
we can see them right now!

01:37.313 --> 01:38.324
I'm not asking again!

01:38.348 --> 01:39.268
Ruz!

01:45.488 --> 01:47.133
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:47.157 --> 01:49.268
10-1, 10-1, shots fired at
the police! We're pinned down!

01:49.292 --> 01:52.271
<i>5021 Henry, back-up's on the way.</i>

01:58.468 --> 02:00.546
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Help's on the way, okay?

02:00.570 --> 02:02.148
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

02:02.172 --> 02:03.783
Okay, we've got an ambulance
coming for you, okay?

02:03.807 --> 02:05.284
Just stay talking to me!

02:05.308 --> 02:06.619
Okay, what are you delivering?

02:06.643 --> 02:09.288
Pills. Pills for the pharmacies.

02:09.312 --> 02:11.157
We're losing him!

02:15.318 --> 02:19.242
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

02:22.492 --> 02:23.869
All right, where we at?

02:23.893 --> 02:26.038
When we rolled up, it was in progress.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.740
Offenders made good their escape.

02:27.764 --> 02:28.974
Yeah, and did some planning.

02:28.998 --> 02:31.377
Took fast escape routes
on the interstate from here.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.678
You got the tags?

02:32.702 --> 02:34.146
Yeah, it came back hot.

02:34.170 --> 02:35.748
Stolen from the Gold Coast a week ago.

02:35.772 --> 02:38.050
Patrol's got a possible
sighting in Humboldt Park.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.129
- Atwater and Burgess are on it.
- Okay.

02:40.153 --> 02:41.654
Driver's in surgery at Med.

02:41.678 --> 02:43.222
Severe blunt-force trauma to the head.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.490
It could go either way.

02:44.514 --> 02:45.591
Okay, what were they after?

02:45.615 --> 02:48.327
- Pills.
- How much did they get?

02:48.351 --> 02:49.929
I checked the driver's manifest.

02:49.953 --> 02:51.330
It looks like they got away

02:51.354 --> 02:52.898
with four boxes of bulk opioids.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.433
Street value of about a quarter million.

02:54.457 --> 02:56.402
Patrolman told me
this is the third van heist

02:56.426 --> 02:57.837
in the area this month.

02:57.861 --> 02:59.171
There's no working PODS on the block.

02:59.195 --> 03:00.873
No luck with business
surveillance either.

03:00.897 --> 03:02.741
All right, let's talk to
the drug manufacturer

03:02.765 --> 03:04.866
and the shipping company.
I want to know all their routes

03:04.890 --> 03:07.346
and what exactly was on those vans.

03:07.370 --> 03:10.015
We figure out how they did it,
should help us find who did it.

03:10.039 --> 03:11.633
- Copy that.
- Let's go.

03:14.210 --> 03:15.621
I spoke to Robbery.

03:15.645 --> 03:17.540
All three vans were owned by
Venture Shipping.

03:18.515 --> 03:19.675
The offenders, they hit
the vans early in their route

03:19.699 --> 03:20.968
while the pig was fat.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.251
They got in and out fast.

03:22.275 --> 03:23.712
Seems like they know what they're doing.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.105
And nothing on the van drivers?

03:25.129 --> 03:27.883
No, all three are clean.
Nothing to suggest it was an inside job.

03:27.907 --> 03:28.997
So...

03:29.021 --> 03:30.967
All right, our best lead
comes from these blowups

03:30.967 --> 03:32.845
taken from a nearby auto repair shop.

03:32.869 --> 03:34.813
Now this? This is offender one.

03:34.837 --> 03:36.582
This guy's got $300 sneakers on.

03:36.606 --> 03:37.950
This is the one
that beat down the driver.

03:37.974 --> 03:39.585
The driver said he was speaking English.

03:39.609 --> 03:40.853
He sounded like a local.

03:40.877 --> 03:42.421
All right, boss, as far as I can tell,

03:42.445 --> 03:44.156
this is all about the opioids.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.357
But in this whole process,

03:45.381 --> 03:46.925
there were some other meds taken.

03:46.949 --> 03:48.927
- Other drugs?
- Mm-hmm.

03:48.951 --> 03:51.964
All right, these pills
distinct enough to ID?

03:51.988 --> 03:54.133
Not really... they all got the
same manufacturer stamp,

03:54.157 --> 03:55.293
but that's about it.

03:55.317 --> 03:57.136
- Hey, Sarge.
- Anything on the SUV?

03:57.160 --> 03:59.037
Yes, sir, they found it
empty on a random lot

03:59.061 --> 04:01.273
in Humboldt Park, two miles
away from the robbery.

04:01.297 --> 04:02.593
Techs ran the GPS.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.630
The SUV was parked on a Back Of
The Yards neighborhood

04:04.654 --> 04:06.612
for two days,
one block from a known drug den

04:06.636 --> 04:08.447
owned and operated by the Night Lords.

04:08.471 --> 04:09.982
But you know what?

04:10.006 --> 04:12.785
I got a junkie unwitting
that's actually pretty tight

04:12.809 --> 04:13.834
with some of these guys.

04:13.858 --> 04:16.000
He grew up with them.
I could take a run at him.

04:16.024 --> 04:17.978
- Chase it.
- Copy that.

04:21.584 --> 04:23.562
Hey, Tommy, it's your boy, Eddy.

04:23.586 --> 04:25.123
What's up?

04:27.250 --> 04:30.636
Sarge, now my guy couldn't
say much over the phone,

04:30.660 --> 04:33.138
but it sounds like the Night
Lords have a large inventory

04:33.162 --> 04:34.540
of painers at the moment.

04:34.564 --> 04:36.875
Guy by the name of Time Bomb
is selling the stuff.

04:36.899 --> 04:39.311
That's what he goes by.
His real name is Eric Shaw.

04:39.335 --> 04:40.813
He did two stints in Big Muddy,

04:40.837 --> 04:42.347
one for armed robbery,

04:42.371 --> 04:43.816
the other one for aggravated assault.

04:43.840 --> 04:46.351
He beat up his PO
with the handle of a shotgun.

04:46.375 --> 04:47.920
Sounds like our offender one.

04:47.944 --> 04:50.155
All right, find out what
your guy knows about the heist

04:50.179 --> 04:51.824
and Eric Shaw.

04:51.848 --> 04:53.992
But our priority is getting
Shaw off the street.

04:54.016 --> 04:55.561
So I want you to bring Adam with you,

04:55.585 --> 04:57.396
put him in play as a dealer,

04:57.420 --> 04:59.323
set up a buy/bust of Shaw.

04:59.347 --> 05:00.899
It's a little early
for all that, don't you think?

05:00.923 --> 05:02.701
I'm better solo with my guy. Trust me.

05:02.725 --> 05:04.670
No, I want all pieces in place.

05:04.694 --> 05:06.498
I want Adam close.

05:08.898 --> 05:11.294
If you got a problem with me
around opioids, just say it.

05:13.323 --> 05:14.423
I just did.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:27.049 --> 05:29.050
It comes right from the source?

05:30.386 --> 05:32.888
I can get 1,000 of those
in your hand by tomorrow.

05:37.237 --> 05:39.271
40k, nonnegotiable.

05:39.295 --> 05:40.772
I mean, it looks legit, man,

05:40.796 --> 05:43.308
but I'm serious when I say
I need a steady supply.

05:43.332 --> 05:45.110
Not a problem.

05:45.134 --> 05:48.947
All right, well, we got a deal then.

05:48.971 --> 05:50.382
But at 30.

05:53.442 --> 05:55.505
I don't negotiate.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.224
I'm here as a favor to Tommy.

05:59.248 --> 06:01.261
If you don't like my terms, that's fine.

06:03.346 --> 06:07.055
All right. Yeah, yeah, we got a deal.

06:07.990 --> 06:12.271
Uh, you, uh, just call me
when you're ready to do this.

06:12.295 --> 06:14.065
Tommy's got my number.

06:14.664 --> 06:16.598
See you, Tommy.

06:20.136 --> 06:22.737
Hank, you seen this?

06:29.478 --> 06:32.090
- That's catchy.
- Where are we at?

06:32.626 --> 06:34.693
We're circling a dealer
in the Night Lords.

06:34.717 --> 06:36.194
You're circling?

06:36.218 --> 06:37.763
Kate, it takes time.

06:37.787 --> 06:40.098
Bad guys don't run on an election cycle.

06:40.122 --> 06:42.290
Oh, okay.

06:42.792 --> 06:44.536
Look, I know you've got
bad blood with Kelton.

06:44.560 --> 06:45.804
I get it.

06:45.828 --> 06:47.272
But if you want Intelligence to survive,

06:47.296 --> 06:49.541
you're gonna have to make peace with him.

06:49.565 --> 06:51.543
Now, I do not want to bury you, Hank.

06:51.567 --> 06:52.778
I'm a Chicagoan.

06:52.802 --> 06:54.146
I know the good work that you guys do.

06:54.170 --> 06:56.214
It's not that simple, Kate. You know it.

06:56.238 --> 06:59.486
Hey, boss. Excuse me, Miss Deputy.

06:59.842 --> 07:01.453
Uh, Shaw just made a phone call.

07:01.477 --> 07:02.888
He's ready to do the deal.

07:02.912 --> 07:04.990
Good, set it up.
Have Jay and Hailey ghost.

07:08.651 --> 07:10.796
Anything else?

07:21.497 --> 07:23.175
Are you guys all set?

07:23.199 --> 07:25.834
Yeah, we got you, Adam.

07:29.872 --> 07:32.140
All right, all right.
This is Shaw; here we go.

07:38.381 --> 07:40.151
All right, all right.

07:45.688 --> 07:49.218
If I remember correctly, we said no guns.

07:49.242 --> 07:51.603
Yeah, for you and me.

07:51.627 --> 07:53.271
My guys pack.

07:53.295 --> 07:55.007
<i>Is it gonna be a problem for you?</i>

07:55.500 --> 07:57.294
Hey, where's the stuff?

07:58.200 --> 08:00.012
You first.

08:05.074 --> 08:06.841
<i>All right.</i>

08:17.453 --> 08:18.940
It's all there.

08:19.789 --> 08:23.028
All right, hop in.

08:23.926 --> 08:27.072
Hop in? No. No, no, man. No.

08:27.096 --> 08:28.940
You told me you were gonna
bring the stuff here, man.

08:28.964 --> 08:31.376
No, I said we had a deal.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.211
<i>How we do that deal is up to me.</i>

08:33.235 --> 08:36.282
- This is not good.
- It's Adam's call.

08:36.306 --> 08:37.816
He hasn't used the distress signal yet.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.918
I have a lot of cash here, man.

08:40.337 --> 08:41.986
And it ain't like you and I go way back.

08:42.010 --> 08:43.381
You know what I mean?

08:44.780 --> 08:46.591
You in or out, bro?

08:46.615 --> 08:48.136
Where do you want me to go?

08:49.471 --> 08:50.929
I got a house over on Webster.

08:50.953 --> 08:52.564
No prying eyes. Come on.

08:52.588 --> 08:53.899
I don't like it.

08:53.923 --> 08:56.401
5021 Henry, do you have any patrol cars

08:56.425 --> 08:58.270
near 3400 Princeton?

08:58.294 --> 09:01.106
<i>10-4, I show 922 coming off
a traffic stop a block away.</i>

09:01.905 --> 09:04.132
Have them do a slow crawl down Princeton.

09:05.968 --> 09:08.447
All right, let's go.

09:13.943 --> 09:15.821
Hey, hold up.

09:15.845 --> 09:17.457
What the hell?

09:19.815 --> 09:22.079
No, no, no. It's off.

09:22.110 --> 09:23.695
Yo.

09:23.719 --> 09:25.163
If this is on you, you're dead.

09:25.187 --> 09:27.199
Bro, it's just a cop car, man.

09:27.223 --> 09:29.434
<i>Hey, yo, Shaw. He just turned, bro.</i>

09:29.458 --> 09:32.637
Dude, it's just a cop.
He probably lost his donuts.

09:32.661 --> 09:34.391
Man, come on!

09:36.165 --> 09:37.609
Come on!

09:53.433 --> 09:55.399
Hey, guys.

10:00.639 --> 10:02.250
What the hell was that?

10:02.274 --> 10:04.759
What was that? I had the prick.

10:04.784 --> 10:06.662
- I don't understand it.
- Had him?

10:06.686 --> 10:08.430
He wanted you to go mobile.
We weren't equipped for that.

10:08.454 --> 10:10.199
- Had rip written all over it.
- All right, who made the call?

10:10.223 --> 10:11.431
- It doesn't matter.
- I did.

10:11.455 --> 10:13.494
Yeah, you made the wrong
call. You made it too early.

10:13.495 --> 10:14.947
Listen, when I'm in the middle of it

10:14.948 --> 10:17.034
and I use the distress signal,
then we call it.

10:17.059 --> 10:18.128
If I don't use the distress signal...

10:18.160 --> 10:20.961
I made the call, Adam. Move on.

10:24.735 --> 10:26.446
- Let it go, bro.
- Hey, Trudy.

10:26.470 --> 10:27.947
- Yeah?
- This mic's a little spotty.

10:27.971 --> 10:29.549
- I'll have tech take a look.
- Thanks.

10:29.573 --> 10:32.675
Hailey, just give me a second.

10:39.917 --> 10:43.129
Look, I know that it's complicated...

10:43.153 --> 10:44.964
It had nothing to do with us.

10:44.988 --> 10:47.172
It had nothing to do with us.
Are you sure?

10:48.025 --> 10:49.424
Yes.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.451
So where we at with Shaw?

11:04.475 --> 11:05.919
Can we get this deal back on track?

11:05.943 --> 11:08.121
Well, he just texted me a bunch of emojis

11:08.145 --> 11:09.389
I never even knew existed.

11:09.413 --> 11:11.658
So based on that, I'm guessing
that the deal is off.

11:11.682 --> 11:13.960
Well, we're keeping the pressure on.

11:13.984 --> 11:16.596
Going from the top didn't work,
so we start from the bottom.

11:16.620 --> 11:18.798
We catch one of Shaw's crew
dirty and flip him.

11:18.822 --> 11:20.366
Narcotics know where the Night Lords

11:20.390 --> 11:21.543
are slinging these pills?

11:21.567 --> 11:22.847
There's a house in the Back Of The Yards

11:22.871 --> 11:24.173
that's getting a lot of action.

11:24.174 --> 11:25.552
Walk ups, hands offs, stuff like that.

11:25.576 --> 11:27.153
It's on the corner of Ashland and 54th.

11:27.177 --> 11:30.323
It's been up for demolition
for about a year.

11:30.347 --> 11:32.492
Would you look at that?
Look who it's registered to.

11:32.516 --> 11:34.160
Shaw's uncle.

11:34.184 --> 11:37.097
Get eyes on that house. Let's go.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.243
We got another hype
coming in... white, 30s.

11:50.267 --> 11:52.479
<i>Male with a beard.</i>

11:52.503 --> 11:55.348
<i>Green army jacket, green ski cap.</i>

11:55.372 --> 11:57.684
<i>Looks like another buyer.</i>

11:57.708 --> 12:00.120
Okay, let us know when
you got eyes on the seller.

12:03.881 --> 12:05.258
Oh, that's a negative.

12:05.282 --> 12:06.860
Just another satisfied customer.

12:10.713 --> 12:12.165
Hold on.

12:14.558 --> 12:16.002
Who's that?

12:16.026 --> 12:17.604
He went in the house about two hours ago.

12:17.628 --> 12:19.439
He might be a runner re-upping the spot.

12:19.463 --> 12:20.951
We need to stay with this guy.

12:20.975 --> 12:23.083
Okay, we think we got one of
Shaw's boys exiting the house.

12:23.107 --> 12:24.602
Looks like he's carrying a bag.

12:26.145 --> 12:27.881
Here we go.

12:27.905 --> 12:29.386
I think she just gave him cash.

12:29.410 --> 12:30.910
Okay, I'm gonna stay with the buyer.

12:30.934 --> 12:32.118
I'll let you know if we got a positive.

12:32.142 --> 12:33.520
All right, we're going on foot.

12:33.544 --> 12:34.840
Copy that.

12:41.151 --> 12:44.622
Ah, he's gonna run. Son of a bitch.

12:46.990 --> 12:48.701
- Hey, stop right there!
- Cut him off!

12:48.725 --> 12:50.837
5021 Ida, I've got a male
offender in a red jacket

12:50.861 --> 12:52.672
fleeing under the...

12:52.696 --> 12:55.008
Last seen fleeing southbound on Ashland.

12:55.032 --> 12:56.643
Let me see what's in the bag.

12:56.667 --> 12:57.844
Give me the bag.

12:57.868 --> 12:59.066
- No.
- Give me the bag!

12:59.090 --> 13:00.380
How are we doing?

13:00.404 --> 13:01.581
She says there's no pills in there.

13:01.605 --> 13:03.082
Hands up. Get your hands up.

13:03.106 --> 13:04.217
Do you have anything sharp on you?

13:04.241 --> 13:06.653
- No.
- Turn around.

13:06.677 --> 13:09.255
I don't know.
These look a lot like pills.

13:09.279 --> 13:11.491
What's your name? You got an ID?

13:11.515 --> 13:13.493
Hey, hey! Slow.

13:13.517 --> 13:15.028
Gina Reilly.

13:20.190 --> 13:21.901
Out of the way! Out of the way!

13:21.925 --> 13:23.336
- Chicago PD!
- Out of the way!

13:23.360 --> 13:24.671
Out of the way! Police!

13:24.695 --> 13:26.906
Out of the way! Move! Police! Police!

13:26.930 --> 13:28.583
Hey! Out of the way!

13:29.800 --> 13:31.611
Hey!

13:31.635 --> 13:33.713
Out of the way! Out of the way! Move!

13:33.737 --> 13:35.381
5021 Eddie, we've got
a man on the tracks.

13:35.405 --> 13:36.883
- Advise CTA.
- Move! Move!

13:36.907 --> 13:39.118
Shut down the Red Line
towards Lansing! Shut it down!

13:41.378 --> 13:44.257
<i>Copy that, 5021 Eddie. We'll notify CTA.</i>

13:58.284 --> 13:59.950
- Get an ID?
- Joe Powell.

13:59.951 --> 14:02.272
Nickname J-Dog. Two busts for distro.

14:02.297 --> 14:04.610
Three DUIs and battery
to a police officer.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.279
Born and raised in the Yards.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.381
Been running with Shaw's crew
for a couple years.

14:08.405 --> 14:10.717
- High level guy?
- Nah, just a packman.

14:10.741 --> 14:12.719
Everything in our records
shows he's a wannabe.

14:12.743 --> 14:14.821
All right, what about
the buyer... she know anything?

14:14.845 --> 14:16.672
Hailey is starting
to talk to her right now.

14:17.714 --> 14:19.459
This is all a misunderstanding.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.494
I'm not a drug addict. I swear!

14:21.518 --> 14:24.787
- Okay.
- Hey, I need a word.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.738
What's up?

14:31.762 --> 14:33.540
I ran the identifiers on those pills

14:33.564 --> 14:35.141
you caught her with.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.876
They're not opioids.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.178
What are they?

14:38.202 --> 14:40.180
Uh, it's a drug called Lumicin.

14:40.204 --> 14:41.906
It treats a rare liver disease.

14:42.539 --> 14:44.250
Can you get high taking them?

14:44.274 --> 14:45.652
No.

14:45.676 --> 14:46.886
Why would someone steal them?

14:47.286 --> 14:49.330
It costs about 40 grand a month.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.058
- 40 grand?
- Yeah.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.045
So are you saying Gina's sick?

14:57.020 --> 14:59.332
Gina's dying.

15:12.970 --> 15:15.004
<i>Hey, um...</i>

15:16.240 --> 15:18.317
<i>We made a few phone calls.</i>

15:18.976 --> 15:20.653
<i>We know what's going on.</i>

15:21.979 --> 15:23.614
<i>We know you're sick.</i>

15:24.866 --> 15:26.860
<i>So you... you know I wasn't out
there on the street</i>

15:26.884 --> 15:28.119
buying dope.

15:29.219 --> 15:30.964
Yeah.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.297
If you don't mind talking about it,

15:40.397 --> 15:43.042
those pills you take, Lumicin,

15:43.532 --> 15:45.233
what does it do for you?

15:46.904 --> 15:50.172
It replaces an enzyme
my liver can't produce anymore.

15:51.241 --> 15:52.552
It keeps me alive.

15:55.897 --> 15:57.657
I'm assuming since you're
getting them on the corner,

15:57.681 --> 16:00.260
your insurance doesn't cover the costs?

16:00.284 --> 16:02.528
What insurance?

16:03.287 --> 16:05.098
I lost it a year ago.

16:05.122 --> 16:08.334
And, uh, my husband's insurance
doesn't cover it, so...

16:13.964 --> 16:16.342
The guy that gave you the pills...

16:16.366 --> 16:19.913
Joe Powell... how do you know him?

16:19.937 --> 16:21.314
I don't, really.

16:21.338 --> 16:23.683
I just... I knew where to go.

16:23.707 --> 16:26.142
And you knew that
he would have these pills?

16:29.046 --> 16:32.258
How did you know that?
Did someone tell you?

16:32.282 --> 16:33.976
Yeah, a friend.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.313
Does this friend have a name?

16:38.773 --> 16:41.057
Am I under arrest?

16:42.192 --> 16:43.653
We're just talking.

16:44.987 --> 16:47.156
But you've got to level with me, okay?

16:48.966 --> 16:51.600
We've been chasing a robbery crew.

16:52.869 --> 16:55.237
And they steal meds from vans.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.953
We have the delivery manifests.

16:59.977 --> 17:03.746
And all of the vans had Lumicin in them.

17:05.549 --> 17:07.627
Three bottles were taken
in the last heist

17:07.651 --> 17:09.628
and those are the three bottles
I found on you.

17:12.589 --> 17:14.474
This guy here?

17:17.493 --> 17:19.939
He almost got killed in the last attack.

17:20.530 --> 17:22.608
He may never walk again.

17:25.402 --> 17:27.445
If what you say is true,

17:27.838 --> 17:34.010
that someone's committing
crimes to save my life...

17:36.179 --> 17:38.758
Then those robberies
might be my only hope

17:38.782 --> 17:41.050
to see my daughter grow up.

17:43.186 --> 17:45.365
I help you, I die.

17:55.198 --> 17:57.560
- This is a tough one, Sarge.
- I know.

17:58.602 --> 18:00.380
You still got a job to do.

18:00.730 --> 18:03.182
Jay, any more of this Lumicin
coming to Chicago?

18:03.206 --> 18:04.717
I'm trying to get an answer on that.

18:04.741 --> 18:06.519
The drug companies
aren't being responsive.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.854
A lot of privacy issues.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.355
But, uh, I'm working on it.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.890
I got something.

18:10.914 --> 18:13.026
I found a nexus between Gina's
husband, Robert,

18:13.050 --> 18:15.094
and our shot caller Eric Shaw.

18:15.118 --> 18:16.237
They're cousins.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.930
They went to the same high school.

18:17.954 --> 18:19.966
They're in a bunch of social
media pictures together.

18:19.990 --> 18:22.201
All right, what do we know about him?

18:22.225 --> 18:24.604
Uh, full name Robert Reilly. He's 34.

18:24.628 --> 18:25.805
He didn't even have a sheet

18:25.829 --> 18:27.211
until about six months ago, Sarge.

18:27.235 --> 18:28.908
Uh, he was a high school Algebra teacher.

18:28.932 --> 18:31.594
Had to take a leave of absence
when Gina got sick.

18:32.678 --> 18:35.381
His height, weight, and build
are a match for offender two.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.883
So we're gonna dig into him.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.052
I mean, he and Shaw are
cousins... how close are they?

18:39.076 --> 18:40.219
What about Gina?

18:40.243 --> 18:43.898
We hold her for 48 hours,
keep her away from phones.

18:44.414 --> 18:47.093
All right, let's get eyes on Reilly fast.

18:52.823 --> 18:54.158
There he is.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.916
We got eyes on our target.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.085
He's on the move in his Toyota.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.619
We're gonna keep a loose tail.

19:13.643 --> 19:15.188
We're headed westbound on Ivy Street.

19:34.197 --> 19:35.975
I thought this guy was
an unemployed teacher.

19:35.999 --> 19:38.277
What the hell is this place?

19:38.301 --> 19:39.779
5021 George.

19:39.803 --> 19:43.149
Squad, run an address.
Uh, 4101 South Packers.

19:43.173 --> 19:45.451
I'm trying to get
the name of the business.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.286
<i>4101 South Packers.</i>

19:47.310 --> 19:50.656
<i>Ownership comes back to a
corporation, Venture Shipping.</i>

19:50.680 --> 19:52.125
<i>Do you need backup?</i>

19:52.149 --> 19:53.884
No, we're good. Mobile out.

19:55.094 --> 19:57.319
You've got to be kidding me.

19:58.321 --> 20:01.134
Reilly is the inside man.
Fox guarding the hen house.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.802
The hen house is filled with opioids

20:02.826 --> 20:05.661
and the drug that's going
to keep his wife alive.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.742
So we know all three vans
worked for Venture Shipping.

20:09.766 --> 20:11.310
Reilly works in their dispatch unit.

20:11.334 --> 20:12.712
He started three months ago.

20:12.736 --> 20:14.313
He has access to all the delivery routes.

20:14.337 --> 20:16.549
Now all the van drivers said
the first guy was muscle,

20:16.573 --> 20:17.984
the second guy took the drugs.

20:18.008 --> 20:21.154
So Shaw handles the drivers,

20:21.178 --> 20:24.190
Reilly grabs the drugs
and the Lumicin for his wife.

20:24.214 --> 20:25.992
Yeah, it's a very good theory.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.710
How do we prove it?

20:28.785 --> 20:30.819
We get up on Gina's phone.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.870
Gina, we appreciate your patience.

20:37.894 --> 20:39.096
You're free to go.

20:40.931 --> 20:42.842
You're not charging me?

20:42.866 --> 20:45.868
No. Sorry it took so long.

20:47.070 --> 20:49.348
I convinced our ASA to not
press any charges

20:49.372 --> 20:51.473
considering everything
you're going through.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.843
Thanks.

20:57.380 --> 20:59.481
I'm going to shoot you straight, okay?

21:01.484 --> 21:02.862
If it's in your power,

21:02.886 --> 21:05.748
if you know anything about
these robberies...

21:06.665 --> 21:08.534
You need to call the people
that are doing them

21:08.558 --> 21:09.925
and make them stop.

21:11.394 --> 21:12.642
Okay.

21:15.565 --> 21:16.800
Okay.

21:17.968 --> 21:20.246
<i>I'm sorry, we'll send in
the payment today.</i>

21:20.270 --> 21:22.315
<i>Thanks for understanding.
This is your last delay...</i>

21:23.974 --> 21:26.052
Healthcare bills.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.154
You get sick, they never stop.

21:28.178 --> 21:30.890
My dad's still paying off my
grandfather's cancer treatment.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.491
He died five years ago.

21:33.950 --> 21:35.761
All right, another call coming in.

21:35.785 --> 21:37.563
That's Reilly's number.

21:37.587 --> 21:41.667
<i>- Baby, is that you?
- Yeah. How's Hannah?</i>

21:41.691 --> 21:43.135
<i>She's good.</i>

21:43.159 --> 21:45.071
<i>Listen, sweetie, uh, I can't talk.</i>

21:45.095 --> 21:48.307
<i>Just know I'm working on something big.</i>

21:48.331 --> 21:51.077
<i>Bob, listen to me. I'm begging you.</i>

21:51.101 --> 21:52.578
<i>It's gone too far.</i>

21:52.602 --> 21:55.105
<i>Don't do this. We can find another way.</i>

21:55.129 --> 21:57.216
<i>There is no other way.</i>

21:58.175 --> 22:02.121
<i>We're gonna beat this together, okay?</i>

22:02.145 --> 22:03.923
<i>Okay.</i>

22:03.947 --> 22:06.425
<i>I love you so much.</i>

22:06.449 --> 22:08.317
<i>I love you too.</i>

22:12.188 --> 22:13.666
Something big? What's that?

22:13.690 --> 22:15.001
Jay talked to Venture Shipping.

22:15.025 --> 22:16.769
He said they're going to have
armored guards

22:16.793 --> 22:18.104
with every van now.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.605
Reilly would know that.

22:19.629 --> 22:22.108
They've got to be hitting
a wholesaler or a pharmacy.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.833
I'll call Voight.

22:26.069 --> 22:28.314
All right, listen up. Kim, Kevin?

22:28.338 --> 22:30.149
Get over to Shaw's house.
If he's still there,

22:30.173 --> 22:32.351
just lay low.
You wait for him to move out.

22:32.375 --> 22:35.988
Jay, reach back out to
your manufacturing contacts.

22:36.012 --> 22:38.457
We need to know where
this Lumicin is sitting.

22:38.481 --> 22:40.192
Hey, hold up.

22:40.216 --> 22:41.927
I got something coming
from Dispatch about a pharmacy.

22:42.439 --> 22:44.250
Squad, can you repeat that robbery call?

22:44.275 --> 22:46.620
<i>Armed Robbery in progress.
24-hour Pharmacy.</i>

22:46.645 --> 22:48.556
<i>50th and Shields.
We have cars on the way.</i>

22:48.581 --> 22:49.629
Let's go.

22:49.654 --> 22:51.561
10-4. Show 5021 units responding.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.944
Get back! Get back!

23:00.003 --> 23:02.348
- Hey, cover the back!
- Copy that.

23:02.372 --> 23:04.491
- Ready?
- Ready.

23:24.260 --> 23:26.105
Chicago PD!

23:26.129 --> 23:27.890
Let me see your hands, Reilly.

23:28.932 --> 23:31.577
Stand up! Stand up!

23:31.601 --> 23:33.546
Put your hands on your head.

23:33.570 --> 23:35.064
Now walk forward.

23:35.905 --> 23:37.524
Nice and easy.

23:38.608 --> 23:40.119
Nice and easy.

23:40.143 --> 23:42.521
Stop right there. Down on your knees.

23:46.916 --> 23:48.394
He's gone.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.315
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

24:00.798 --> 24:02.750
<i>Oh, man, what did you just do?</i>

24:02.774 --> 24:04.635
<i>What did you do?</i>

24:05.950 --> 24:09.852
It's clear that you never
meant to hurt anyone, Bob.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.561
All right?

24:14.166 --> 24:16.011
You stuck around.
You tried to save that man

24:16.035 --> 24:17.446
when I know you knew we were coming.

24:17.470 --> 24:20.182
You could've just as well
left him to die alone.

24:20.567 --> 24:23.852
Now Bob, I-I know your story, okay?

24:23.876 --> 24:25.954
I know what's going on with your wife.

24:25.978 --> 24:27.589
She has nothing to do with this.

24:27.613 --> 24:28.990
I'm not saying that she does.

24:29.014 --> 24:30.192
What I'm trying to say to you

24:30.216 --> 24:32.494
is I would very much like to help you.

24:32.518 --> 24:34.696
But we've got to start with you
telling me about the guy

24:34.720 --> 24:36.488
who just killed that man.

24:38.030 --> 24:40.364
Now I know it's your cousin, Eric Shaw.

24:43.696 --> 24:45.384
You're not gonna say anything?

24:46.398 --> 24:47.509
Nothing?

24:48.454 --> 24:52.266
Okay, you're staring down
three counts of armed robbery

24:52.290 --> 24:53.682
and felony murder.

24:53.706 --> 24:55.283
That's life in prison.

24:55.307 --> 24:58.147
That's you never seeing your
kid as a free man ever again.

24:58.171 --> 25:00.178
That's your wife dying alone.

25:05.317 --> 25:08.484
Just tell me about Shaw. All right?

25:08.508 --> 25:11.160
Just tell me about him and then
you and I, we make a deal.

25:12.892 --> 25:14.739
- Not a chance.
- Please, Bob.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.137
This is the best thing for your family.

25:16.161 --> 25:18.373
I'm not lying to you here.
I'm telling you the truth.

25:18.397 --> 25:21.142
It's not. Trust me.

25:25.295 --> 25:27.482
Because Shaw still has
your wife's drugs, is that it?

25:29.241 --> 25:30.919
Nothing you can say,

25:31.346 --> 25:34.055
nothing you can threaten, is
ever going to change my mind.

25:40.119 --> 25:42.063
I want a lawyer.

25:44.857 --> 25:46.078
Okay.

25:55.734 --> 25:57.245
He's not gonna flip,

25:57.269 --> 25:59.080
not while Shaw has those pills anyway.

25:59.104 --> 26:00.515
He loves his wife too much.

26:00.539 --> 26:02.183
He's not gonna jeopardize her health.

26:02.207 --> 26:03.785
Did we get anything from the crime scene?

26:03.809 --> 26:06.254
Witnesses saw a masked man
hop into an SUV and take off.

26:06.278 --> 26:08.290
No license plate. No forensics.

26:08.314 --> 26:10.258
Uh, the pharmacy did confirm
that the offender made off

26:10.282 --> 26:11.860
with a bunch of opioids

26:11.884 --> 26:13.228
and about six months' worth of Lumicin.

26:13.252 --> 26:15.196
Which is now in the hands of Shaw.

26:15.220 --> 26:17.032
Has he talked to his wife?

26:17.056 --> 26:18.199
No, we brought him straight here.

26:18.223 --> 26:19.434
They've had no contact at all.

26:19.458 --> 26:22.994
Okay. Okay, Gina. Notify her.

26:23.822 --> 26:25.389
Have a talk.

26:31.782 --> 26:33.742
That man has two daughters.

26:34.493 --> 26:36.620
They're never going to see
their father again.

26:37.142 --> 26:39.955
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

26:39.979 --> 26:42.513
Oh, my God.

26:43.282 --> 26:47.923
Gina, right now Bob is going
to prison for felony murder.

26:48.757 --> 26:50.398
You just said that he wasn't the shooter,

26:50.422 --> 26:52.434
that he was trying to help
the pharmacist.

26:52.458 --> 26:54.469
Doesn't matter. He's involved.

26:54.873 --> 26:57.182
Legally, he's held responsible.

27:02.301 --> 27:04.523
I need you to be honest with me.

27:05.983 --> 27:07.315
What do you know about the robberies?

27:07.339 --> 27:11.152
Nothing specific.

27:11.176 --> 27:12.854
Bob kept me in the dark.

27:14.064 --> 27:15.957
But you knew they were robbing vans?

27:15.981 --> 27:18.526
He never... he never told me.

27:18.550 --> 27:20.161
But, um...

27:20.185 --> 27:22.263
Once I realized that
Venture Shipping vans

27:22.287 --> 27:23.625
were being robbed,

27:24.023 --> 27:25.586
I did the math.

27:26.587 --> 27:29.037
It's not like he had
some big criminal plans.

27:29.061 --> 27:32.507
Just... he just wanted to keep me alive.

27:32.531 --> 27:34.109
We were desperate.

27:36.035 --> 27:37.097
I know.

27:41.540 --> 27:44.142
What about his cousin, Eric Shaw?

27:45.377 --> 27:47.555
Uh, Bob never said he was involved.

27:47.579 --> 27:48.942
Not explicitly.

27:49.815 --> 27:51.649
But I-I knew it was him.

27:53.385 --> 27:56.531
Bob said if... if anything
ever happened to him,

27:56.867 --> 27:58.967
I should reach out to Shaw.

27:58.991 --> 28:01.469
- Have you?
- Not yet.

28:01.493 --> 28:04.162
Okay. That's good.

28:08.167 --> 28:09.511
We'd like you to reach out to Shaw

28:09.535 --> 28:11.798
and get him talk
about the pharmacy heist.

28:13.939 --> 28:15.802
You want me to wear a wire?

28:16.709 --> 28:17.929
Yeah.

28:20.345 --> 28:23.477
If you help us,
we might be able to help Bob.

28:24.311 --> 28:26.227
Reduce his sentence to manslaughter.

28:26.251 --> 28:27.996
He'll be out in three to four years.

28:32.224 --> 28:34.559
And, um, uh, what about my medicine?

28:35.894 --> 28:39.908
Shaw's the one who controls it,
so if you arrest him,

28:39.932 --> 28:41.578
I won't get it.

28:42.735 --> 28:44.779
Gina, those pills were stolen.

28:47.539 --> 28:51.953
They're evidence now.
Proceeds from the robbery.

28:55.140 --> 28:57.975
But if I-I do all this, you'll help Bob.

28:58.951 --> 29:00.639
You have my word.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.727
I'm in.

29:07.626 --> 29:08.939
You sure?

29:09.898 --> 29:11.900
He would do the same thing for me.

29:30.449 --> 29:31.760
All right, we got a good signal.

29:31.784 --> 29:34.418
- Gina's camera's up.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

29:37.322 --> 29:39.434
She's making a hell of a sacrifice.

29:39.720 --> 29:41.221
They're madly in love.

29:49.640 --> 29:51.106
<i>Come in.</i>

29:52.504 --> 29:54.025
All right, we're up.

29:54.540 --> 29:57.118
Everyone hang tight.
Wait for her to draw him out.

29:57.142 --> 29:58.653
<i>On my call.</i>

29:58.864 --> 30:00.822
<i>I can't believe this is happening.</i>

30:00.846 --> 30:02.490
<i>Talked to Bob yet?</i>

30:02.514 --> 30:04.119
<i>Yeah, for, like, two minutes.</i>

30:05.078 --> 30:07.462
<i>He told me to hire a lawyer
and he told me to get my meds.</i>

30:07.486 --> 30:08.830
<i>He said you had them.</i>

30:08.854 --> 30:11.001
<i>- What else he say?
- Nothing.</i>

30:12.919 --> 30:14.369
<i>You talk to the police?</i>

30:14.393 --> 30:16.337
<i>No, he... he asked
for a lawyer, that's it.</i>

30:16.361 --> 30:18.139
<i>- What about you?
- What do you mean?</i>

30:18.163 --> 30:19.841
<i>Have you talked to the cops?</i>

30:19.865 --> 30:22.644
<i>They came by, but I didn't say anything.</i>

30:22.668 --> 30:24.379
<i>'Cause I-I don't really know anything.</i>

30:24.403 --> 30:26.314
<i>That's how Bob wanted it.</i>

30:26.683 --> 30:28.950
<i>But I'm not stupid... I know
what you two have been doing.</i>

30:28.974 --> 30:31.519
<i>This is all my fault.
I should've put a stop to it.</i>

30:31.543 --> 30:33.064
<i>- Hey, calm down.
- Calm down?</i>

30:33.774 --> 30:36.057
<i>Bob's in jail for murder!</i>

30:36.081 --> 30:38.026
<i>It is what it is.</i>

30:38.050 --> 30:40.562
<i>It was his idea to do those robberies.</i>

30:40.864 --> 30:42.664
<i>He wanted to help you.</i>

30:43.158 --> 30:46.000
<i>Yeah, I'm sure you're right,
but I guarantee you,</i>

30:46.024 --> 30:47.836
<i>it wasn't his idea to shoot
that pharmacist.</i>

30:47.860 --> 30:49.571
All right, here we go. Here we go.

30:49.595 --> 30:52.373
<i>No need to talk about that. That's over.</i>

30:52.397 --> 30:55.543
<i>For you! Not for Bob, not for me.</i>

30:55.567 --> 30:57.512
<i>That pharmacist got exactly
what he deserved.</i>

30:57.536 --> 30:59.573
<i>He reached for a gun.
I did what I had to do.</i>

30:59.597 --> 31:00.637
Got him.

31:00.661 --> 31:02.050
Wait, can we give her a sec, boss?

31:02.074 --> 31:03.384
<i>What's up?</i>

31:03.408 --> 31:05.013
Just give her a sec to find her meds.

31:05.577 --> 31:07.222
All right, everyone stand by.

31:07.246 --> 31:10.558
<i>Look, just... just give
my meds and I'll go, okay?</i>

31:10.582 --> 31:12.827
<i>You'll never hear from me again.</i>

31:13.271 --> 31:16.387
<i>Sure. They're upstairs. Come on.</i>

31:17.556 --> 31:20.068
<i>No, I'm... I'm not gonna go
up there with you.</i>

31:20.612 --> 31:22.531
<i>I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>

31:24.324 --> 31:27.208
<i>- Okay, I'm... I'm leaving.
- You're not going anywhere.</i>

31:27.232 --> 31:28.743
<i>Sunshine!</i>

31:28.767 --> 31:30.945
That's the safe word. Come on, let's go.

31:34.907 --> 31:36.211
Hailey, cover me.

31:55.427 --> 31:56.437
All right, downstairs is clear.

31:56.461 --> 31:57.691
We're going up.

31:58.563 --> 32:01.242
Copy. Nothing out here.

32:01.266 --> 32:02.977
We'll hold it down.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.158
Clear.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.805
<i>I'm gonna blast this bitch
all over the walls!</i>

32:30.829 --> 32:33.975
<i>Okay, you listen to me now!</i>

32:33.999 --> 32:35.643
<i>I will blast this bitch! You hear me?</i>

32:35.667 --> 32:37.312
There's no way out of this!

32:37.336 --> 32:38.980
Don't mess with me, copper!

32:39.004 --> 32:41.149
Put the weapon down! Let Gina go!

32:41.173 --> 32:42.684
Too late for all of that!

32:42.708 --> 32:45.453
<i>Talk to me, Hailey. You guys all right?</i>

32:45.477 --> 32:47.989
Yeah. Yeah, we're okay. We're okay.

32:48.013 --> 32:50.124
He's got Gina upstairs
in the front bedroom.

32:50.148 --> 32:52.460
We're holed up in the back.

32:52.484 --> 32:54.162
Your leg. Your leg.

32:54.186 --> 32:56.164
I got it.

32:56.188 --> 32:58.166
You've got to tie it off.
You gotta tie it off.

33:03.662 --> 33:07.008
- You all right? Okay.
- Yeah. I'm okay.

33:07.032 --> 33:08.343
You gotta pull it out.

33:08.367 --> 33:09.811
- No, no. We'll wait for it.
- Adam.

33:09.835 --> 33:11.806
- We'll wait for the ambo.
- Pull it out.

33:15.207 --> 33:16.851
- You ready?
- Yeah.

33:21.246 --> 33:22.890
- Stay here.
- Wait, Adam.

33:22.914 --> 33:26.461
Wait, he doesn't know I'm here.
I'm gonna go in.

33:26.485 --> 33:27.528
It's the only advantage we've got.

33:27.552 --> 33:28.863
No, no, no, no, no.

33:28.887 --> 33:30.465
Adam, it's the only advantage we have.

33:30.489 --> 33:32.200
You're gonna keep him talking.
I'm gonna go.

33:32.224 --> 33:35.370
- No, no, no. No!
- Adam, I'm good.

33:35.394 --> 33:37.572
Just keep him talking.

33:48.407 --> 33:51.753
Listen, Shaw, talk to me, man.

33:51.777 --> 33:53.388
You hear those sirens?

33:53.412 --> 33:55.323
The only way out of here is with me.

33:55.347 --> 33:57.058
Don't mess with me, copper.

33:59.084 --> 34:00.355
Go.

34:02.954 --> 34:04.671
Just let Gina go.

34:04.695 --> 34:06.067
It's too late for all that.

34:06.091 --> 34:08.569
Then you and I can figure this thing out.

34:08.592 --> 34:12.163
Stop talking. You don't know me!

34:13.065 --> 34:14.742
Shaw.

34:14.766 --> 34:17.246
Listen to me, man.

34:17.902 --> 34:20.125
We know you were trying to help Gina.

34:21.739 --> 34:23.851
Don't change the story.

34:23.875 --> 34:25.887
Let her go. That's all I care about.

34:25.911 --> 34:27.755
Then you can figure out what
you and I are gonna do.

34:27.779 --> 34:30.591
Don't play your games with me, man!

34:30.614 --> 34:32.460
Get out of my head!

34:32.484 --> 34:34.889
If Gina dies, that's on you!

34:35.786 --> 34:37.431
Bro!

34:38.784 --> 34:39.900
Just send her out!

34:39.925 --> 34:41.936
Stay back or
I'll blow her head right off!

34:41.960 --> 34:43.876
I'm not moving! I'm not moving!

34:57.309 --> 34:58.619
Give me a reason!

34:58.643 --> 35:00.254
- Oh, my God!
- Give me a reason!

35:00.278 --> 35:02.924
You're okay. You're okay.
We got you. We got you.

35:02.948 --> 35:04.248
We got you.

35:14.553 --> 35:16.473
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

35:17.055 --> 35:18.894
- How's your leg?
- It's fine.

35:18.918 --> 35:19.954
Good.

35:19.978 --> 35:22.237
Narcotics found the opioids in the attic.

35:22.261 --> 35:23.517
We found the Lumicin too.

35:23.541 --> 35:25.071
All right, has it been inventoried?

35:25.095 --> 35:27.809
- Yeah.
- That's not good.

35:27.833 --> 35:30.305
Hey, uh, I... I think we need
to get you to a hospital

35:30.329 --> 35:33.381
- just to be safe.
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I just...

35:33.405 --> 35:36.017
I've had my fill of doctors
and hospitals lately.

35:37.876 --> 35:40.154
Listen, I want to see my husband.

35:40.178 --> 35:41.489
Gina.

35:41.513 --> 35:43.925
Look, I know this is all my fault.

35:43.949 --> 35:45.260
If I didn't get sick, I...

35:45.284 --> 35:48.096
No, hey. Don't do that to yourself.

35:49.588 --> 35:51.532
Everything he did, he did for me.

35:51.556 --> 35:53.601
He was trying to save me.

35:53.625 --> 35:56.571
I just... I just... I wanna see him.

35:56.595 --> 35:58.106
Please!

35:58.130 --> 36:00.331
All right, I'm gonna take you.

36:05.710 --> 36:07.554
- Oh, Chief.
- Hank.

36:07.639 --> 36:09.317
May I have a word?

36:13.205 --> 36:18.809
So I talked to Kiesel
in Narcotics 'cause...

36:20.085 --> 36:23.131
I wanted to use some of those
drugs seized at Shaw's house

36:23.155 --> 36:24.749
for an operation.

36:26.124 --> 36:27.460
Hmm.

36:28.126 --> 36:30.161
They said you took control.

36:37.288 --> 36:39.489
You already handled the problem?

36:43.175 --> 36:44.394
I did.

36:48.613 --> 36:50.733
I watched my mother suffer through it.

36:52.818 --> 36:55.930
Had to sell her damn house
just to pay for her meds.

37:01.993 --> 37:03.671
Kate, you're better than Kelton.

37:12.938 --> 37:15.706
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:16.808 --> 37:18.353
I won't ask how your leg is

37:18.377 --> 37:20.096
'cause you'll just tell me it's fine.

37:20.779 --> 37:22.765
- 'Cause it's fine.
- See?

37:23.548 --> 37:25.184
How are you otherwise?

37:28.153 --> 37:29.330
You mean Adam?

37:29.354 --> 37:31.789
Yeah, I noticed a little tension.

37:33.024 --> 37:34.736
I thought I could pull it off.

37:35.694 --> 37:39.730
Find balance. It's a tough one.

37:42.868 --> 37:44.245
Yeah.

37:45.203 --> 37:47.498
I'm gonna give you some advice.

37:49.007 --> 37:51.892
Because, for a young woman,
I am wise beyond my years.

37:53.049 --> 37:55.623
And I do care what happens
to both of you.

37:55.647 --> 37:57.008
I appreciate that.

37:58.083 --> 38:00.418
Look...

38:02.154 --> 38:06.225
If Adam's the one, then make it work.

38:07.352 --> 38:09.704
But that probably means that one of you

38:09.728 --> 38:11.606
has to get out of Intelligence.

38:16.568 --> 38:19.937
It's a very tiny needle
you're trying to thread here.

38:22.908 --> 38:24.285
Yeah, I know.

38:25.844 --> 38:27.488
And if neither one of us
are willing to make

38:27.512 --> 38:29.323
that kind of sacrifice?

38:29.347 --> 38:31.058
Then what you have isn't worth

38:31.082 --> 38:33.494
compromising your career for.

38:43.428 --> 38:44.722
Yeah.

38:51.703 --> 38:52.897
Hailey.

38:58.109 --> 38:59.779
That was a long day, huh?

39:00.780 --> 39:02.115
Yeah.

39:05.116 --> 39:07.695
Look, I was hoping we could
go back to my place

39:07.719 --> 39:09.764
and just talk about everything.

39:13.425 --> 39:17.261
I think maybe we should
just talk right now.

39:24.569 --> 39:26.314
Okay.

39:45.457 --> 39:49.093
Adam, I want you to know
I care about you a lot.

39:51.963 --> 39:53.666
- But...
- I know.

39:57.669 --> 39:59.255
I know you do.

40:01.973 --> 40:04.275
It's hard being together
and working together.

40:05.710 --> 40:07.138
Yeah.

40:09.981 --> 40:11.809
But it's more than that though.

40:13.731 --> 40:15.229
Isn't it?

40:20.825 --> 40:22.195
Yeah.

40:26.304 --> 40:27.533
Yeah.

40:32.904 --> 40:34.540
Maybe we should take a break.

40:39.511 --> 40:40.922
Yeah.
