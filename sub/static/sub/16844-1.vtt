WEBVTT

02:29.508 --> 02:31.635
Stop pushing.

02:37.808 --> 02:39.935
Stop pushing.

02:51.322 --> 02:53.616
Please, calm down.

02:53.699 --> 02:55.409
In November of 1924,

02:55.534 --> 02:58.995
during a weekend yacht party
bound for San Diego,

02:58.996 --> 03:02.499
a mysterious death occurred
within the Hollywood community.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.337
However, there was no coverage
in the press, no police action,

03:06.420 --> 03:08.923
and of the 1 4 passengers
on board,

03:09.006 --> 03:12.134
only one was ever questioned
by authorities.

03:12.218 --> 03:15.721
Little evidence exists now,
or existed at the time,

03:15.805 --> 03:18.724
to support any version
of those weekend events.

03:18.808 --> 03:21.602
History has been written
in whispers.

03:21.727 --> 03:24.313
This is the whisper
told most often.

03:24.396 --> 03:25.606
The yacht, you see,

03:25.731 --> 03:28.025
belonged to
William Randolph Hearst.

03:32.696 --> 03:36.325
Only in a place like this
do reporters and autograph hounds

03:36.408 --> 03:40.120
have absolutely no scruples about
stampeding mourners at a funeral.

03:40.204 --> 03:41.705
Welcome to Hollywood,

03:41.831 --> 03:44.333
a land just off the coast
of the planet earth.

04:12.111 --> 04:14.028
After we all leave,

04:14.029 --> 04:16.197
the man in the box
will disappear.

04:16.322 --> 04:18.409
Just his ashes
will remain.

04:18.534 --> 04:22.204
After all, it's fire
that can hurt you, not ashes.

05:01.619 --> 05:04.037
...you're listening to KFI.

05:04.038 --> 05:06.831
And stay tuned
for our weekend music marathon,

05:06.832 --> 05:08.918
with our own
KFI studio orchestra.

05:20.304 --> 05:22.723
I fear this bizarre
yet fascinating town,

05:22.807 --> 05:24.433
but I can't leave it.

05:24.517 --> 05:27.728
You see, I'm never quite certain
if I'm visiting the zoo,

05:27.812 --> 05:30.523
or if I'm one
of the animals in a cage.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.527
Don't you dare!
I will not be seen arriving early.

05:34.610 --> 05:36.236
Yes, ma'am.

05:36.237 --> 05:38.697
I want to avoid
the solution to this riddle

05:38.823 --> 05:41.324
but the man in the box
forces us to confront it.

05:41.325 --> 05:44.119
All of us were there
that weekend.

05:44.203 --> 05:46.205
Stop!

05:46.330 --> 05:48.415
I am not here.

05:55.714 --> 05:57.800
The birthday boy is early.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.635
He must be anxious.

06:06.725 --> 06:08.935
My God, this thing
must be 200 feet.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.521
- 220.
- He owns that?

06:10.604 --> 06:12.815
And the ocean it's sitting in
and the sky above.

06:12.898 --> 06:13.899
What are you doing?!

06:14.024 --> 06:17.235
The old boy should give you the ship
as a birthday present, Tom.

06:17.236 --> 06:19.405
We could sell it and
get the studio out of hock.

06:19.530 --> 06:21.323
Don't be melodramatic,
George, no one's in hock.

06:21.407 --> 06:24.617
We're not far away.
I don't know about this new strategy.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.704
It's like I told you,
people's tastes have changed.

06:26.829 --> 06:29.039
They want to read more modern stories.
Contemporary, adult.

06:29.123 --> 06:31.333
Like the kind you read
in Hearst's magazines.

06:31.417 --> 06:34.128
Will it be like this
all the way to San Diego and back?

06:34.211 --> 06:36.421
Besides, he has a lot
of other assets to offer.

06:36.422 --> 06:37.798
Yeah, cash.

06:37.923 --> 06:40.425
I still don't think it's
the right time. Too obvious.

06:40.426 --> 06:43.429
Relax, George.
No one's going to be obvious.

06:43.512 --> 06:45.431
Business. Business.

08:07.012 --> 08:08.931
Yes, take that bag.

08:09.014 --> 08:10.599
Kono, a starving man

08:10.724 --> 08:12.725
eats the wooden planks
of his log cabin.

08:12.726 --> 08:15.813
- Is that funny?
- No, Mr. Chaplin. Not funny.

08:15.938 --> 08:18.231
Don't hold back.
Tell me what you really think.

08:18.232 --> 08:20.234
Huh? Hmm?

08:20.317 --> 08:23.027
Don't tell me
Elinor Glyn has arrived on time?

08:23.028 --> 08:24.822
Good God,
perhaps even early?

08:26.407 --> 08:28.409
Oh... all right then.

08:30.536 --> 08:32.121
Hello, you little bastard.

08:32.203 --> 08:34.039
The "little" I object to.

08:34.123 --> 08:36.916
I see your young passion flame
is not accompanying you.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.628
Lita? She's not here?
I seem to have forgotten her.

08:39.712 --> 08:42.130
Let's keep it
that way, shall we?

08:42.131 --> 08:44.717
Oh my God!

08:46.218 --> 08:47.511
...they cost him a fortune.

08:47.636 --> 08:49.638
Mr. Chaplin, it is an honor,

08:49.722 --> 08:52.099
and I mean a true honor
to meet you, sir.

08:52.224 --> 08:53.600
Louella Parsons.

08:53.601 --> 08:56.103
I write for Mr. Hearst's paper
the New York American.

08:56.228 --> 08:58.105
I've been there a whole year.

08:58.230 --> 09:00.900
Louella Parsons of the East,
meet Elinor Glyn of the West.

09:00.961 --> 09:04.256
Elinor is the finest and naughtiest
writer in the entire world.

09:04.403 --> 09:07.031
Oh, you don't have to tell me that.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.617
I wish I could be introduced
as being "of the West."

09:09.700 --> 09:11.034
Whatever makes you happy, dear.

09:11.035 --> 09:12.620
Well,
I'll leave you two alone.

09:12.703 --> 09:15.414
I have something-or-other
to attend to.

09:15.539 --> 09:19.627
Mr. Chaplin, did you happen
to notice the rave review

09:19.710 --> 09:22.338
I gave your last picture,
"A Woman of Paris"?

09:22.421 --> 09:24.632
Yes, I did.
Thank you, that was most kind.

09:24.715 --> 09:27.426
So deserved, so deserved.

09:27.510 --> 09:29.720
It just stinks
that nobody went to see it.

09:29.804 --> 09:32.722
At least you won't lose your shirt
on the next picture too.

09:32.723 --> 09:35.434
I hear at least you have
the good sense to be in this one.

09:35.518 --> 09:38.521
"The Gold Rush."
I hear that's just a hint

09:38.604 --> 09:41.232
as to how much
this picture is costing you.

09:43.108 --> 09:45.319
Oh, there's the birthday boy!

09:45.402 --> 09:47.404
- Marion, sweetheart.
- Happy birthday.

09:47.530 --> 09:50.324
Thank you. It's not until
tomorrow but I always love it

09:50.407 --> 09:52.408
when a beautiful girl kisses me.

09:52.409 --> 09:54.410
- Wow, look at you!
- Thanks.

09:54.411 --> 09:56.622
We should try to find
a naval picture for you,

09:56.705 --> 09:58.540
so we can get
this look on film.

09:58.541 --> 10:00.835
- What do you think, George?
- Absolutely.

10:00.918 --> 10:02.837
- Drinks?
- A natural comic too.

10:02.920 --> 10:04.630
- Thanks.
- So, where's our captain?

10:04.713 --> 10:06.214
He'll be down
in a minute.

10:06.215 --> 10:08.217
...if I'm truly
going to make a difference,

10:08.300 --> 10:10.302
is a daily column
with my name on top,

10:10.427 --> 10:12.303
marking the place
where both the people

10:12.304 --> 10:14.140
in the audience
and on the screen

10:14.223 --> 10:16.016
can come together
to read the truth,

10:16.100 --> 10:18.602
not just vicious gossip
and innuendo.

10:18.727 --> 10:20.938
Keep after old WR,
I'm sure he'll come around.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.023
I plan to, believe you me.

10:23.107 --> 10:26.527
Take you, for example.
I want you to know that l, for one,

10:26.610 --> 10:30.030
am so sorry about your difficulties
with your little co-star,

10:30.114 --> 10:32.116
this little girl, Lita...

10:32.241 --> 10:34.618
Oh! We're here.

10:34.702 --> 10:37.204
- Allow me.
- Yes, it's... moving.

10:38.539 --> 10:41.124
Oh! So, Mr. Chaplin,

10:41.125 --> 10:44.920
if you ever need a sympathetic
person to confide in, I'm all ears.

10:45.004 --> 10:47.214
After all, you'll need
someone on your side

10:47.339 --> 10:49.800
when the shocking truth emerges.

10:49.925 --> 10:51.635
Thank you very much, Ms. Parsons.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.137
- Lolly.
- Hmm?

10:53.220 --> 10:56.807
Lolly. All my close friends
call me Lolly.

10:56.932 --> 10:58.434
- Lolly.
- Um-hmm.

10:58.517 --> 11:00.436
So, Mr. Chaplin...

11:00.519 --> 11:02.521
Goddamn
son of a bitch!

11:04.231 --> 11:06.733
If you kids'll
excuse me again for a sec.

11:06.734 --> 11:09.612
- Charlie, how are you?
- Safe, for the moment.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.614
You know George Thomas,
my business partner?

11:11.739 --> 11:13.032
- George.
- Charlie.

11:13.115 --> 11:16.117
This is Miss Margaret Livingston,
George's guest and a delightful actress.

11:16.118 --> 11:17.535
- Charmed, I'm sure.
- Me too.

11:17.536 --> 11:19.622
- And Mrs. Ince?
- Couldn't make it,

11:19.705 --> 11:21.624
one of our boys
isn't feeling well.

11:21.707 --> 11:23.334
- Sorry to hear that.
- Yeah...

11:23.417 --> 11:26.921
Say, that "Woman of Paris"
was a terrific picture.

11:27.004 --> 11:29.215
Pretty big risk you took
by not being in it.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.425
You're a risk taker, Charlie,
just like me.

11:31.509 --> 11:34.011
Just when you got everyone laughing
at your Little Tramp character,

11:34.136 --> 11:36.514
you make some
weepy melodrama without him.

11:36.639 --> 11:39.517
You can't fault the man
for taking a gamble.

11:39.642 --> 11:42.603
And anyhow, failure is
a character builder. Right, Charlie?

11:42.728 --> 11:45.523
I don't know, Tom,
you tell me.

11:45.606 --> 11:48.234
Thanks a lot. You introduce me
and then you hog him to yourself.

11:48.317 --> 11:50.318
Little prick.

11:50.319 --> 11:52.320
Really? I hear he's got
a pretty big one.

11:52.321 --> 11:53.729
Actors running a studio.

11:53.730 --> 11:55.804
It's like the goddamn serfs
running the palace.

11:56.325 --> 11:58.619
He lost his shirt
in that last picture.

11:58.702 --> 12:00.412
He's so over budget
on "The Gold Rush,"

12:00.538 --> 12:02.915
his partners aren't even
returning his phone calls.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.680
And his 1 6-year-old leading lady
collapsed on the set... pregnant.

12:05.709 --> 12:07.211
- No kidding?
- Uh-huh.

12:07.336 --> 12:10.214
They learn about the birds and bees
so much younger these days.

12:10.339 --> 12:11.507
The buzz is that
Chaplin did the pollinating.

12:11.632 --> 12:12.842
Oh, yeah?

12:14.009 --> 12:16.720
Oh, Zoe. Can you get me
some more of these? Thank you.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.805
Did you hear that hack
lecture me?

12:18.806 --> 12:21.433
Hack? The man built
three movie studios all by himself.

12:21.517 --> 12:24.436
Just 'cause he builds a paint shop
doesn't make him Van Gogh.

12:25.521 --> 12:27.105
Why haven't...

12:27.106 --> 12:29.108
Come here.

12:31.610 --> 12:34.529
Why haven't you returned any
of my phone calls, you little shit?

12:34.530 --> 12:36.031
'Cause I hate telephones.

12:36.115 --> 12:39.034
Maybe I was calling to tell you
to stay away this weekend.

12:39.118 --> 12:41.829
That would pretty much ensure
that I turn out, wouldn't it?

12:41.912 --> 12:43.038
Willie's heard about us.

12:43.122 --> 12:45.541
He's even had
private detectives around.

12:45.624 --> 12:47.834
He only invited you
so he could watch us.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.837
Nothing can happen
this weekend.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.504
What are you doing
next weekend?

12:51.505 --> 12:54.215
Jesus, Charlie! You didn't get me
into bed and you're not going to.

12:54.216 --> 12:57.135
- Says who? You or Captain Willie?
- Says me.

12:57.136 --> 12:59.722
I've got to go help
little Miss Lolly...

12:59.805 --> 13:00.806
I mean it!

13:00.931 --> 13:04.142
You start anything, I'll throw you
and your smirk overboard.

13:04.143 --> 13:05.602
Marion!

13:05.603 --> 13:07.520
Do you believe
I would've stayed away?

13:07.521 --> 13:09.022
No.

13:09.023 --> 13:11.817
But you should really believe
that I wanted you to.

13:15.613 --> 13:17.907
I won't have anybody
walk on this boat

13:18.032 --> 13:19.742
without being
introduced to everybody.

13:19.825 --> 13:22.703
Lolly, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Lolly.

13:22.828 --> 13:24.120
- Hi.
- Louella Parsons.

13:24.121 --> 13:27.124
This is one of Willie's
insightful movie reviewers.

13:27.208 --> 13:30.210
Especially because of the wonderful
things she writes about me.

13:30.211 --> 13:31.921
And...

13:32.004 --> 13:34.632
I wrote them before I knew
you were Mr. Hearst's...

13:35.716 --> 13:38.302
You know, before you
and the boss... I knew that...

13:38.427 --> 13:40.137
Uhm...

13:42.139 --> 13:45.142
Gosh, this thing
is big, isn't it?

13:45.226 --> 13:47.603
Yes, dear, but does he know
how to use it?

13:49.814 --> 13:51.523
Well, that's that.

13:51.524 --> 13:54.527
I'll get the captain
so we can shove off.

14:00.032 --> 14:02.743
Did you hear that, Pops?
I'm coming up.

14:29.228 --> 14:30.604
Very convincing.

14:30.729 --> 14:33.816
- Oh, is anyone here yet?
- Everyone's here and you know it.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.819
Are you gonna come down
from Mount Olympus or what?

14:37.333 --> 14:39.543
There's no need
for sarcasm, Marion.

14:39.630 --> 14:42.549
You're the one up here in
radio central spying on everyone.

14:42.583 --> 14:45.377
- Those who have nothing to fear...
- Save the Bible quotes.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.621
- It's not from the Bible.
- Whoever then.

14:47.746 --> 14:49.622
Fine, go right ahead
and keep spying

14:49.623 --> 14:51.333
'cause there's nothing to see.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.628
There have been whispers.

14:54.753 --> 14:57.547
Stop listening to whispers
and listen to me.

14:57.548 --> 15:00.550
There's nothing going on
between me and Charlie.

15:00.551 --> 15:01.844
Okay?

15:05.723 --> 15:08.350
I bought you something...
in New York.

15:08.434 --> 15:10.060
- Willie...

15:10.144 --> 15:11.853
It's beautiful.

15:11.854 --> 15:14.023
But you already gave me
a butterfly brooch.

15:14.148 --> 15:18.027
Oh no! That's diamonds and rubies.
This is diamonds and jade.

15:18.152 --> 15:19.820
You don't have
one of these.

15:19.945 --> 15:21.739
There are a lot of things
I don't have.

15:21.822 --> 15:24.450
- If you love someone...
- You can't buy me all of them.

15:24.533 --> 15:27.620
you try to get them
what they don't get themselves.

15:28.746 --> 15:30.247
I love you so much.

15:31.332 --> 15:33.459
Don't ever stop.

15:33.542 --> 15:35.544
And I'll always be here,

15:35.628 --> 15:38.047
don't you know that?

15:38.130 --> 15:39.840
Thank you.

15:40.925 --> 15:43.761
Every time you thank me...
what do I say?

15:43.844 --> 15:46.639
"Shut up and keep me happy, Pops."

15:46.722 --> 15:48.432
Exactly.

15:55.147 --> 15:57.733
Ah, Dr. Goodman.

15:57.858 --> 15:59.443
I didn't see you come on board.

15:59.527 --> 16:02.029
You know me, Joe.
Elusive as ever.

16:02.154 --> 16:05.031
- How's the chief today?
- A little edgy, Dan.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.242
- Marion?
- Why else?

16:07.243 --> 16:09.160
No, I mean, how is Marion?

16:09.161 --> 16:10.830
Oh. The usual.

16:10.955 --> 16:12.331
- Spunky.
- Uh-huh.

16:12.456 --> 16:14.333
Permission to come aboard!

16:14.458 --> 16:16.042
Here we go.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.128
- Frank, how are you?
- Joseph!

16:18.254 --> 16:20.840
- Not late, are we?
- Not at all, not at all.

16:22.925 --> 16:25.344
- Who's he?
- Boring Frank Barham,

16:25.427 --> 16:27.345
the pill of the
Hearst publishing world.

16:27.346 --> 16:29.849
They are invited to remind WR
that for every one of us

16:29.932 --> 16:31.725
- There are two of them.
- What's the wife called?

16:31.851 --> 16:33.144
Who knows?

16:33.227 --> 16:35.521
Oh my word!
What a big boat!

16:35.646 --> 16:37.857
Correction, who cares?

16:40.359 --> 16:42.528
Marion! Marion, honey.

16:42.653 --> 16:44.946
Do you trust Tom Ince?

16:44.947 --> 16:46.448
Do you trust him?

16:46.532 --> 16:48.659
Well, he doesn't drink
during the day.

16:48.742 --> 16:51.453
- Can't trust him.
- Hmm? Oh...

16:51.537 --> 16:54.038
And I better not catch you two
talking business.

16:54.039 --> 16:56.542
- Or what?
- Or you'll get yours.

16:57.543 --> 16:58.752
Aww...

17:00.838 --> 17:02.631
Well, here he is.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.340
Finally.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.344
Welcome!

17:11.140 --> 17:12.724
Such a remarkable
economy of words

17:12.849 --> 17:15.226
for one who controls
more print than Jesus Christ.

17:15.227 --> 17:17.438
Take that back, or I'll have
to dishonor your good name.

17:17.521 --> 17:19.856
I hope someone does.
I'm feeling rather frisky.

17:19.857 --> 17:22.358
Lolly, Madam Glyn
would like a word.

17:22.443 --> 17:23.444
Bastard!

17:23.527 --> 17:26.321
Mrs. Glyn, I've read every one
of your wonderful,

17:26.446 --> 17:28.156
wonderful books.

17:28.156 --> 17:29.325
How lovely for you, dear,

17:29.450 --> 17:32.453
but do forgive me,
I have to go to write another one.

17:34.038 --> 17:38.125
Chief, it's nearly noon.
We should try to keep on schedule.

17:44.340 --> 17:46.133
Stop!

17:47.259 --> 17:49.136
Raise the gangplank!

17:49.261 --> 17:50.929
- No!
- Oh my God!

17:50.930 --> 17:54.557
- Wait!
- Stop!

17:54.558 --> 17:55.851
Oh, thank God.

17:57.228 --> 17:59.729
He always does this to us!
Every time!

17:59.730 --> 18:01.524
I'm sweating like a pig.

18:01.649 --> 18:04.360
How am I gonna land anyone
with sweat dripping down my nose?

18:04.443 --> 18:05.736
Don't bitch, Didi,
I'm not in the mood.

18:05.861 --> 18:07.738
Hi! Hello!

18:16.831 --> 18:20.751
I think this is going to be
a most enjoyable boat ride.

18:20.835 --> 18:23.629
Yeah... the cat's meow.

18:24.630 --> 18:27.424
That's it everybody!
Out to sea!

18:55.035 --> 18:57.454
Wow.

19:06.630 --> 19:09.550
Jesus Christ, Tom!

19:09.633 --> 19:11.551
- You want everyone to hear you?
- Yes!

19:11.552 --> 19:13.762
- Be sensible, please.
- God!

19:13.846 --> 19:16.932
You said this time
was going to be different,

19:17.057 --> 19:20.227
that I was going to come off
George's arm and onto yours.

19:20.352 --> 19:22.438
You will.
We've gotta be delicate.

19:22.563 --> 19:24.940
We've got to find
the right moment.

19:25.024 --> 19:27.150
No one cares
if you're having an affair.

19:27.151 --> 19:29.445
Look at Hearst and Marion,
for Christ's sake!

19:29.528 --> 19:30.768
Mrs. Hearst knows about Marion.

19:30.863 --> 19:33.449
She doesn't approve of divorce,
but she approved the arrangement.

19:33.532 --> 19:35.451
She wants to stay
a very rich woman

19:35.534 --> 19:37.414
with the last name of Hearst.
Who can blame her?

19:37.453 --> 19:40.748
Now it's your innocent,
vulnerable wife who's the excuse.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.249
I'm trying to make
a deal with the guy.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.752
So not getting
on his morally objectionable side...

19:44.835 --> 19:47.337
The man's whole life
is morally objectionable!

19:47.338 --> 19:49.548
You're getting loud!

19:49.736 --> 19:53.657
Sorry. You just...
get me crazy sometimes.

19:54.866 --> 19:57.743
No, you're right.
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

19:57.744 --> 20:00.454
I'm not giving you a chance
to strut your stuff.

20:00.455 --> 20:03.541
- I don't want to strut my stuff...
- See, there you go...

20:03.667 --> 20:05.626
- You're selling yourself short.
- I just want to strut with you.

20:05.627 --> 20:07.253
You're a fabulous actress

20:07.337 --> 20:09.630
and you should be
given a chance to shine.

20:09.631 --> 20:12.842
We can't be pushy is all I'm saying.

20:12.968 --> 20:15.637
Let me work some of my magic
on the old man...

20:15.762 --> 20:17.430
and we'll get you noticed.

20:17.555 --> 20:19.557
As an actress
or on your arm?

20:19.641 --> 20:22.643
The lady places a tall order,
but maybe we can do both.

20:22.644 --> 20:24.646
- Yeah?
- Hmm...

20:24.729 --> 20:27.065
Okay.

20:51.548 --> 20:55.468
"Flames of Youth"?

20:55.552 --> 20:57.846
Dear God!

21:07.939 --> 21:10.567
WR,

21:10.650 --> 21:12.860
you're early for dinner.

21:12.861 --> 21:15.237
I always like to come out
just before sundown.

21:15.238 --> 21:16.947
The best time
to watch for seagulls.

21:16.948 --> 21:19.159
What? Oh, yeah.
Beautiful creatures.

21:19.242 --> 21:22.328
You know, Tom,
I just love movies.

21:22.329 --> 21:23.955
I always thought the press

21:24.039 --> 21:26.540
was the most powerful thing
for a communicator

21:26.541 --> 21:29.252
- But that's not true these days.
- You're absolutely right.

21:29.336 --> 21:33.131
Words don't always translate well
across seven continents.

21:33.256 --> 21:37.135
But through those fabulous,
fabulous moving pictures...

21:37.260 --> 21:41.056
Well, it's a universal language,
and morality and politics...

21:41.139 --> 21:44.267
and any other goddamn thing
I can put into someone's head.

21:44.351 --> 21:46.435
Son of a bitch!

21:46.436 --> 21:48.647
Your days are numbered,
you little bastard!

21:48.730 --> 21:50.940
You gotta keep your gun low
or else they see it.

21:51.066 --> 21:52.651
Yeah, yeah... I see.

21:52.734 --> 21:55.654
- Can I be frank with you, WR?
- You can be whoever you like, Tom.

21:55.737 --> 21:58.364
I think your eye for movies
is right on target.

21:58.365 --> 22:00.241
- You do?
- But you have to face facts.

22:00.367 --> 22:02.869
There's some things
even you can't control.

22:02.952 --> 22:04.829
- Like what?
- Your whole empire,

22:04.954 --> 22:07.248
your family,
is based on the east coast.

22:07.332 --> 22:09.333
- The movies are in California.
- I'm aware of that.

22:09.334 --> 22:11.461
You should also be aware
that movie producers

22:11.544 --> 22:14.338
can't send orders over the telephone
and they can't have yes men

22:14.339 --> 22:15.548
represent them
when real decisions...

22:15.632 --> 22:18.051
You're being
almost inexcusably frank.

22:18.134 --> 22:20.136
God damn it!

22:20.261 --> 22:23.056
There's a lot of money
in movies, WR.

22:23.139 --> 22:24.765
Yeah, mine!

22:24.766 --> 22:26.642
I've made millions
from this business and...

22:26.643 --> 22:29.229
we both know that despite
the quality of your pictures

22:29.354 --> 22:30.854
you've never made back a dime...

22:30.855 --> 22:33.649
All right, suppose I believe
your frank observations,

22:33.650 --> 22:36.653
are you implying that Thomas H. Ince
can make a difference?

22:36.736 --> 22:38.446
I'm not implying,
I'm stating.

22:38.530 --> 22:41.157
I'm talking about personally
overseeing Cosmopolitan Pictures.

22:41.241 --> 22:44.160
- Marion's career in particular.
- How personally?

22:45.161 --> 22:46.161
Well...

22:46.162 --> 22:50.165
consulting with you on which scripts
and directors are right for her.

22:50.166 --> 22:53.169
- Making sure her productions...
- What's in it for you?

22:56.965 --> 23:00.259
The stories in Cosmopolitan
and other magazines, for starters.

23:00.260 --> 23:02.261
Hmm...

23:02.262 --> 23:06.056
It's not that I doubt your
background in the business, Tom.

23:06.057 --> 23:09.268
On the contrary... that's just where
it's been lately, in the background.

23:09.269 --> 23:12.355
You have to admit, you're not
the force you were five years ago.

23:12.439 --> 23:14.566
That maybe true
of both of us, WR.

23:14.649 --> 23:18.153
But I think we both have
different strengths

23:18.236 --> 23:20.362
to help
the other's weaknesses.

23:20.363 --> 23:21.948
No offense, Tom...

23:22.032 --> 23:25.368
But if I'm in trouble I don't need
a cripple to help me up.

23:28.163 --> 23:30.331
Ha! Gotcha!

23:30.332 --> 23:32.250
Look at him fall.

23:32.334 --> 23:34.336
Splash.

23:34.461 --> 23:37.046
That's the one that tried
to get away before. Stupid bird!

23:37.047 --> 23:38.965
You've ever eaten a seagull, Tom?

23:40.258 --> 23:42.552
- No.
- They taste awful.

23:42.636 --> 23:45.138
Just like eating a crow.

24:02.155 --> 24:04.157
Are you gonna let me in?

24:05.241 --> 24:07.035
I'll kick the door in.

24:07.160 --> 24:09.244
I'll kick your teeth in.

24:09.245 --> 24:11.831
- Come to my room then.
- Your room?

24:11.956 --> 24:14.751
I mean it. I have a love letter
that needs proofreading.

24:14.834 --> 24:16.835
Why don't you have Lita
proofread it?

24:16.836 --> 24:20.465
- She's not old enough to read.
- How could I forget?

24:20.548 --> 24:23.551
Admit it. You're in love
with me, aren't you?

24:23.635 --> 24:26.846
Not as much as you are
with you, Charlie.

24:57.836 --> 25:00.755
Oh, Doctor. There's something
I wanted to ask you.

25:00.839 --> 25:04.049
Every time I eat grapes
I get extreme palpitations.

25:04.050 --> 25:05.969
I wouldn't worry about it.

25:06.052 --> 25:08.638
My heart starts pounding
and then I break out in a rash.

25:09.306 --> 25:11.432
Everything all right, Chief?

25:11.433 --> 25:13.810
Everything's just fine.

25:13.935 --> 25:17.104
I can't believe he still
only let us have one drink.

25:17.105 --> 25:19.107
Well, Didi, it is illegal.

25:19.232 --> 25:21.526
Yeah, but not for us.
You had yours?

25:21.609 --> 25:24.529
I'm saving it for later
when I'll really need it.

25:24.612 --> 25:27.906
"I don't need a cripple."
He actually said that to you?

25:27.907 --> 25:29.826
Nice way to treat
the guest of honor, huh?

25:29.909 --> 25:31.703
If I had the same mean streak,
I'd throw that fling

25:31.828 --> 25:34.331
Marion and Chaplin are having
right on his face.

25:34.414 --> 25:37.500
- Marion and Chaplin?
- Saw them holding hands on deck.

25:37.625 --> 25:40.128
Notice they're the only ones
we're still waiting for.

25:40.941 --> 25:42.860
I advise you
to keep it to yourself.

25:42.943 --> 25:46.947
- I know, I'm a decent man.
- I need my escort, if you don't mind.

25:49.241 --> 25:52.453
I hope you were not waiting for me
to eat your appetizers.

26:00.044 --> 26:03.047
Since you've decided
to grace us with your presence,

26:03.130 --> 26:05.549
perhaps you'd have the decency
to tell us where to sit.

26:05.633 --> 26:08.552
If Willie had it his way,
he'd talk business all night.

26:08.636 --> 26:13.641
So you, Mr. Birthday Boy,
will sit at my end of the table.

26:13.766 --> 26:16.560
And Willie, why don't we have
Charlie sit by you

26:16.644 --> 26:19.563
- To keep you laughing all night?
- Or is that vice versa?

26:19.647 --> 26:22.441
Now, Charlie,
hold your tongue.

26:24.735 --> 26:26.654
And your seat.

26:30.741 --> 26:32.952
You got me, WR.

26:35.246 --> 26:37.957
I've done it to many people,
but never had it done to me.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.750
How does it feel?

26:39.834 --> 26:42.127
Invigorating.

26:44.755 --> 26:47.258
Get over here, Lolly.
Sit down.

26:47.341 --> 26:50.636
That was hysterical, Mr. Hearst.

27:11.031 --> 27:13.033
Good band, huh?

27:13.159 --> 27:15.326
Especially
the saxophone player, eh?

27:15.327 --> 27:18.455
Yeah, isn't he...
ooh, you caught me.

27:18.539 --> 27:22.751
So, Big Joe, what have you
been up to since I saw you last?

27:22.835 --> 27:25.337
Well, I saw you
in "Lady of the Harem."

27:25.462 --> 27:27.756
Ohh, you did, huh?

27:27.840 --> 27:30.342
And what did your mama
think about that?

27:30.468 --> 27:32.761
Well, Mama was sitting
on my lap.

27:35.556 --> 27:38.767
You're a dirty, dirty boy.

27:41.228 --> 27:43.646
I should forget about him
if I were you.

27:43.647 --> 27:45.232
Pardon me?

27:45.357 --> 27:47.943
Married moguls and mistresses
don't mix, Margaret.

27:48.027 --> 27:51.029
Oh, it's rather good.
I must use that in a novel.

27:51.030 --> 27:52.865
- Have you got a pen?
- Yes.

27:52.948 --> 27:56.827
Marion, not even a teensy weensy
bit of business talk?

27:56.952 --> 27:59.246
What is it, Tom?

27:59.330 --> 28:02.458
I'm trying to negotiate
a deal with WR,

28:02.541 --> 28:06.127
and you gotta tell me the secret.
How do you get through to him?

28:06.128 --> 28:08.547
- You want to know my secret?
- Uh-huh.

28:10.257 --> 28:12.468
I don't have to do
a goddamn thing.

28:12.551 --> 28:13.927
I don't follow you.

28:13.928 --> 28:16.138
People have funny ideas
about me and Willie.

28:16.263 --> 28:18.932
- The whole gold-digger thing.
- No, no, no! I didn't mean...

28:18.933 --> 28:21.142
The truth is,
Willie did the pursuing.

28:21.143 --> 28:23.645
He used to buy two seats every night
when I was in the Follies.

28:23.646 --> 28:25.939
One for him
and one for his hat.

28:25.940 --> 28:28.441
I never once asked him
to put me in a picture.

28:28.442 --> 28:31.946
It would take more to get him
to stop putting me in his pictures.

28:32.029 --> 28:36.367
That's my secret, Tom.
With Willie, I don't have to dig.

28:47.962 --> 28:50.631
So, your husband
is Mr. Frank Barham?

28:50.756 --> 28:53.342
- Yes, he certainly is.
- Hello, darling.

28:53.467 --> 28:55.553
- Who's that?
- That's Mr. Barham.

28:55.554 --> 28:59.244
Oh, I thought maybe
your lover was on board. Too bad.

28:59.327 --> 29:02.163
- Dan, don't be modest.
- Oh, no.

29:02.247 --> 29:04.957
Mr. Hearst takes full responsibility
for Cosmopolitan Pictures.

29:04.958 --> 29:07.335
Everyone knows you're one
of his top executives.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.838
I'm actually a physician by trade.

29:09.963 --> 29:12.424
- Oh, you're a doctor?
- Semi-retired.

29:12.549 --> 29:14.426
Oh nice. Very...

29:14.864 --> 29:16.448
Medicinal.

29:16.574 --> 29:19.660
Maybe I should ask you.
What do you think, Charlie,

29:19.743 --> 29:22.162
about Marion's pictures,
how we've been handling her?

29:22.163 --> 29:24.956
I don't think you've recognized
that she's a wonderful comedienne.

29:24.957 --> 29:28.543
I mean, her eyes, her smile,
her laugh. She's a delight.

29:28.544 --> 29:32.256
Comedy... I don't want people
laughing at Marion.

29:32.339 --> 29:35.258
Well, she doesn't need
any more stodgy period dramas.

29:35.259 --> 29:39.345
Excuse me, but Marion belongs
in serious, important pictures,

29:39.346 --> 29:42.348
certainly not running around
in baggy pants comedy.

29:42.349 --> 29:44.351
No offense, Charlie.

29:44.477 --> 29:47.270
Excuse me, you're not doing
what's right for Marion.

29:47.271 --> 29:50.356
No offense, WR.

29:50.357 --> 29:52.276
I'd like to make a toast.

29:52.359 --> 29:54.737
It's usually Willie's job,
but as you know,

29:54.862 --> 29:58.073
a few weeks ago, us gals,
we got to vote for president again.

29:58.157 --> 30:01.243
So I figured I can do
whatever the hell I darn well please.

30:03.162 --> 30:05.247
Here's to our birthday boy.

30:05.372 --> 30:07.665
Not only did Tom
invent the cowboy picture,

30:07.666 --> 30:09.042
but he helped build this town.

30:09.043 --> 30:11.961
He figured out how to run
a studio that could make

30:11.962 --> 30:15.466
- 1 0 movies at the same time.
- And took credit for all of them!

30:18.969 --> 30:20.054
Oh, Willie!

30:21.138 --> 30:23.349
- To Tom!
- To Tom!

30:24.975 --> 30:26.352
Thank you.

30:26.477 --> 30:28.270
That was very sweet.

30:31.357 --> 30:33.776
Mr. Hearst,
I just want to say,

30:33.859 --> 30:35.944
it's so wonderful
to be here.

30:35.945 --> 30:38.571
The more I see
the lovely people of California

30:38.572 --> 30:41.241
the more I'm reminded
of the need for a columnist...

30:41.242 --> 30:44.744
You know, Lolly, the first rule
of California living

30:44.745 --> 30:47.540
is never to mix
business with pleasure.

30:47.665 --> 30:49.749
Now, what were you saying?

30:49.750 --> 30:51.168
Oh, uh...

30:51.252 --> 30:53.337
I was just saying it's so...

30:53.462 --> 30:56.549
wonderful to see
all these fascinating people

30:56.674 --> 30:58.467
assembled in one place.

30:59.677 --> 31:02.054
You see, Charlie?
That's why I've hired her.

31:02.138 --> 31:03.764
Even with a gun
to her head

31:03.848 --> 31:06.850
she still gives me
unconditionally rave reviews.

31:06.851 --> 31:09.478
As long as nobody
pulls the trigger...

31:12.648 --> 31:14.440
What are you laughing about
down there?

31:14.441 --> 31:16.943
It was the funniest thing ever!

31:16.944 --> 31:19.655
it was all about...
there was a gun at my head

31:19.738 --> 31:22.240
and somebody
pulled the trigger!

31:22.241 --> 31:25.076
Guns and triggers, such violence!

31:25.077 --> 31:27.955
All in line with Madame Elinor's
California Curse.

31:28.038 --> 31:30.040
California Curse?
What's that?

31:30.166 --> 31:33.252
Not that nasty thing.
Not now.

31:33.377 --> 31:34.777
Yes, Elinor,
do educate our visitor.

31:34.837 --> 31:38.465
The California Curse
strikes you like a disease

31:38.549 --> 31:41.177
the minute you set foot in Hollywood,
so pay close attention.

31:41.260 --> 31:43.179
Oh, I am, I am.

31:43.262 --> 31:45.556
You see,
this place you've arrived in,

31:45.639 --> 31:47.266
this place we call home,

31:47.349 --> 31:50.769
isn't a place at all,
but a living creature.

31:50.853 --> 31:52.645
A living creature?!

31:52.646 --> 31:55.566
More precisely, an evil wizard.

31:55.649 --> 31:57.067
Like in the old stories.

31:57.151 --> 32:01.655
- And you all live on him?
- Like fleas on the belly of a mutt.

32:01.739 --> 32:03.365
Exactly.

32:03.449 --> 32:07.077
But unlike the helpless dog,
this wizard is able to banish

32:07.161 --> 32:09.538
the true personalities
of those he bewitches,

32:09.663 --> 32:13.042
forcing them against their will
to carry out his command,

32:13.167 --> 32:15.168
to forget
the land of their birth,

32:15.169 --> 32:17.546
the purpose of their journey,

32:17.671 --> 32:21.050
and whatever principles
they once held dear.

32:21.175 --> 32:24.762
Don't forget about the symptoms,
that's my favorite part.

32:24.845 --> 32:28.057
The curse is taking hold of you
if you experience the following:

32:28.140 --> 32:32.144
you see yourself as the most
important person in any room;

32:32.269 --> 32:36.649
you accept money
as the strongest force in nature;

32:36.774 --> 32:41.445
and finally,
your morality vanishes...

32:41.570 --> 32:43.572
without a trace.

32:46.867 --> 32:49.078
Well, thank God none of us
have been infected, eh, WR?

32:50.538 --> 32:52.248
Umm... yes.

32:52.373 --> 32:54.875
Thank God for that.

32:56.460 --> 32:58.045
Charleston, everybody!

33:01.841 --> 33:04.051
Come on, Pops,
let's show 'em how it's done!

33:04.176 --> 33:05.469
You bet!

33:19.567 --> 33:21.443
What are you looking at?

33:26.240 --> 33:28.367
Oh, I'm tired.
Let's sit down.

33:28.450 --> 33:32.079
Sit? I want to pound my feet so hard
the devil will complain.

34:08.239 --> 34:11.368
Come on, Jay,
take us to the moon!

35:09.969 --> 35:12.763
They've just shot all this
a couple of days ago.

35:12.847 --> 35:14.974
I haven't seen
any of it yet.

35:20.479 --> 35:22.356
Shh!

35:27.653 --> 35:29.572
It's wonderful...

35:39.456 --> 35:41.542
There!
You see that throne?

35:41.667 --> 35:43.669
That throne
is from the 1 6th century.

35:43.752 --> 35:47.339
That's King Lewis II.
I brought that over from Hungary.

35:59.059 --> 36:01.479
Honey, you're wonderful.
Just wonderful.

37:18.764 --> 37:20.349
Get in there!
- Ow!

37:44.665 --> 37:47.543
Wow, Marion, look at you!

37:47.668 --> 37:50.546
Yeah, but that movie
sure went in the shithouse.

37:50.671 --> 37:53.747
Okay, Willie's at the wheel
for two hours so who's first?

37:53.748 --> 37:55.947
- I am!
- Hands off, you little tramp!

37:56.051 --> 37:58.345
Marion, you always have
the best moonshine.

37:58.471 --> 38:01.182
That's because every hour,
bottles arrive from her many admirers.

38:01.265 --> 38:04.768
Well, this one sure's got
sex appeal. Who gave it to you?

38:04.852 --> 38:06.060
Who do you think?

38:06.061 --> 38:08.564
Hmm, I see...

38:08.647 --> 38:10.941
Well, it's mine now.

38:24.955 --> 38:26.456
Ahoy there.

38:26.457 --> 38:28.167
Tom, how are you?

38:28.250 --> 38:29.543
Stuffed!

38:29.668 --> 38:31.253
That was some banquet.

38:31.378 --> 38:34.673
Wait until tomorrow. Marion's
prepared quite a birthday feast.

38:34.757 --> 38:37.843
- Marion is a special woman.
- Yep, she is.

38:37.968 --> 38:41.263
It's so hard to love someone
in our business.

38:41.347 --> 38:43.765
There's so many men
who prey on beauty.

38:43.766 --> 38:47.770
And not sincerely either, but
in cruel ways, just for the conquest.

38:49.271 --> 38:52.274
Take a character
like Chaplin for example.

38:52.358 --> 38:54.777
He's absolutely notorious.

38:54.860 --> 38:57.654
I'm sure you've heard about Lita,
his leading actress.

38:57.655 --> 38:59.281
Mm-hmm.

38:59.365 --> 39:02.243
Apparently she's pregnant
with his child...

39:02.368 --> 39:04.245
she's only 1 6
for Christ sakes!

39:05.663 --> 39:09.750
That's why I keep my Nell
far away from show people.

39:09.875 --> 39:12.545
Women aren't as strong as we are.
They're easily fooled,

39:12.670 --> 39:14.463
their hearts
are easily corrupted.

39:14.547 --> 39:16.381
Yeah, yeah, it is a concern.

39:16.382 --> 39:18.050
It must be, especially...

39:18.175 --> 39:22.053
considering the amount of time you're
forced to spend 3,000 miles apart.

39:22.054 --> 39:24.682
This might be something else
I can help you with.

39:24.765 --> 39:26.642
- What do you mean?
- Well...

39:26.767 --> 39:29.145
if we were to merge
our motion picture interests,

39:29.270 --> 39:31.480
along with
all the other benefits,

39:31.564 --> 39:33.356
I could keep an eye
on her for you.

39:33.357 --> 39:34.858
Hmm...

39:34.859 --> 39:36.944
What makes you think
she needs to be watched?

39:37.069 --> 39:39.655
- Well, she certainly has...
- Is four a crowd?

39:39.780 --> 39:42.366
Not at all. Join us.
You were saying, Tom?

39:43.367 --> 39:45.243
We can talk later.

39:45.244 --> 39:48.247
- Such a charming cabin!
- Good night, everyone.

39:49.665 --> 39:51.876
What a nice man.

39:51.959 --> 39:54.170
Yes. Very nice.

39:55.546 --> 39:58.549
- Here I am with surprises!
- Charlie!

39:58.674 --> 40:01.177
- Let's see what you got, Celia.
- It's dope, Didi.

40:01.260 --> 40:03.179
You had that
the whole car ride?

40:03.262 --> 40:06.264
If I'd told you in the car
that box would be empty right now.

40:06.265 --> 40:10.144
Is it true what they say
about a Jazz man and his instrument?

40:10.269 --> 40:12.146
- Every word, sister.
- Oh!

40:12.271 --> 40:14.648
You're with me.
Come on.

40:14.773 --> 40:16.274
Hey!

40:16.275 --> 40:19.069
You're not gonna be a flat tire
about our playtime, are you?

40:19.153 --> 40:21.071
You do as you like,
Marion, dear.

40:21.155 --> 40:24.074
Just don't expect me to join you
in such infantile nonsense.

40:25.743 --> 40:28.078
Frank, I admire your marriage.

40:28.162 --> 40:30.080
So simple... clean.

40:30.164 --> 40:33.541
- Thank you, WR.
- Nothing complicating things.

40:33.542 --> 40:36.670
Frankly I feel uninteresting
compared with the...

40:36.754 --> 40:39.172
colorful lifestyles
of your other guests.

40:39.173 --> 40:41.257
Lord knows what
they're all up to at this hour.

40:41.258 --> 40:43.051
Frank,
I won't hear such talk.

40:43.052 --> 40:45.970
The codes of decency are something
to be held in high regard.

40:45.971 --> 40:49.475
We should feel no shame for not being
as liberal-minded as the rest.

40:49.558 --> 40:51.059
Darling, please.

40:51.060 --> 40:54.271
No disrespect, but you know what
one of those actress persons

40:54.355 --> 40:55.980
- Said to me at dinner?
- What?

40:55.981 --> 40:58.776
She had the gumption
to ask if Frank was my lover!

40:58.859 --> 41:00.361
- No!
- Yes!

41:00.444 --> 41:01.946
What did you tell her?!

41:02.071 --> 41:05.157
I said, "Mr. Barham is my husband,
deary, we're not lovers."

41:05.282 --> 41:08.869
- You set her straight.
- The thought of such a thing!

41:15.876 --> 41:17.962
Among the finest
I've ever tasted, Celia.

41:18.045 --> 41:20.256
The absolute finest.

41:27.263 --> 41:29.681
- Who is it?
- It's me.

41:29.682 --> 41:32.143
If you say,
"It's Tom Ince

41:32.268 --> 41:35.062
to see Ms. Margaret Livingston
alone in her cabin

41:35.146 --> 41:38.149
on a Saturday night,"
you'll get a big surprise.

41:39.775 --> 41:41.652
It's uh...

41:41.777 --> 41:44.070
Tom Ince to see
Miss Margaret Livingston

41:44.071 --> 41:46.574
alone in her cabin
on a Saturday night.

41:51.579 --> 41:54.081
I suppose that's the best
I'll get out of you.

41:55.082 --> 41:56.876
...He said it was a sausage!

41:58.252 --> 42:00.963
All right, everyone,
time for charades!

42:01.046 --> 42:04.049
We call them "sha-raids."

42:04.175 --> 42:06.677
These are the subjects
I've prepared.

42:06.760 --> 42:08.179
Well...

42:08.262 --> 42:10.180
We will be one team.

42:10.181 --> 42:11.348
Very well.

42:11.474 --> 42:13.767
Didi and Celia
will be team two.

42:13.851 --> 42:15.643
- What a gyp.
- Shut up!

42:15.644 --> 42:17.271
Come on, Marion. Choose.

42:46.175 --> 42:48.343
Two medical students
I once knew.

42:48.344 --> 42:51.055
- Let them get started.
- Noo...

42:56.352 --> 42:59.063
"Indian Love Call,"
by Harback and Hammerstein!

42:59.146 --> 43:00.981
- Guppies!
- No, no.

43:15.871 --> 43:17.665
King and Queen Tut!

43:17.748 --> 43:20.376
There was no Mrs. Tut!

43:37.768 --> 43:40.563
- Oh oh oh!
- Oh, he's getting her now.

43:41.647 --> 43:44.066
Concubines!

43:45.151 --> 43:47.278
Oohh!

43:49.780 --> 43:51.949
I know! Sex!

43:52.074 --> 43:54.284
This charade
is being misread.

43:54.285 --> 43:57.163
Marion, come outside
so I can explain it to you.

44:04.170 --> 44:06.255
Now, Marion,
what's going on?

44:06.380 --> 44:08.464
I promised myself
this wouldn't happen.

44:08.465 --> 44:10.468
You had to promise yourself?!

44:10.551 --> 44:12.845
I don't know,
l... can't think straight.

44:12.970 --> 44:14.555
Have you slept with him?

44:14.680 --> 44:15.973
- No.
- Have you?!

44:16.056 --> 44:18.266
- No!
- Thank God.

44:18.267 --> 44:20.352
You're not
in love with him?

44:20.478 --> 44:22.854
He thinks
he's in love with me.

44:22.855 --> 44:25.649
Charles is only capable
of a monogamous relationship

44:25.774 --> 44:27.485
with his own movies.

44:27.568 --> 44:29.444
But I want
to trust him before l...

44:29.445 --> 44:31.280
Before you what?!

44:31.363 --> 44:33.657
Listen to what you're saying!

44:34.867 --> 44:38.244
You know, Willie's the first man
who ever had faith in me.

44:38.245 --> 44:41.582
And I'm all he's got
keeping him a human being.

44:42.583 --> 44:44.668
I think he'd... he'd...

44:44.752 --> 44:47.170
he'd die if I left him.

44:47.171 --> 44:49.048
I think he would.

44:49.173 --> 44:52.384
And you think Charles Chaplin
would die if you left him?

44:53.469 --> 44:55.346
Charlie might cry
at my grave

44:55.471 --> 44:57.973
and recite
some lousy poem he wrote.

44:58.057 --> 45:00.476
But give him a day or two
and he'd be back in the market.

45:00.559 --> 45:02.978
A day or two?
Charles would copulate

45:03.062 --> 45:05.064
with a reasonably attractive
pallbearer.

45:08.067 --> 45:09.985
What is it, baby?

45:10.069 --> 45:11.444
I'm sorry.

45:11.445 --> 45:13.656
No. Don't be sorry.

45:14.782 --> 45:16.784
- It's just that...
- Talk to me.

45:16.867 --> 45:20.246
- It's just what?
- Everything.

45:21.664 --> 45:24.083
- I feel like it's all slipping away.
- What is?

45:24.166 --> 45:25.960
Everything. Me.

45:27.086 --> 45:30.256
Tonight Hearst called me
a cripple in the picture business.

45:30.381 --> 45:32.675
- That's a lousy thing to say.
- Do people see me as a cripple?

45:32.758 --> 45:35.385
- No.
- Or a credit hog?

45:35.386 --> 45:38.055
- No, honey.
- Oh God...

45:38.180 --> 45:40.348
I used to be a force
in this town.

45:40.349 --> 45:42.767
- You are a force.
- Not too long ago.

45:42.768 --> 45:45.062
I used to make 40 pictures a year.

45:45.146 --> 45:48.064
Now I'm lucky if I
can get one off the ground.

45:48.065 --> 45:51.986
- God, I need him so badly.
- You'll get him.

45:52.945 --> 45:55.156
- You think so?
- I know so.

45:55.281 --> 45:57.782
- Do you?
- Yeah, I know it.

45:57.783 --> 46:00.077
You're a force.

46:01.162 --> 46:03.581
- I am, aren't I?
- You are.

46:19.472 --> 46:21.974
Marion must think
you're a lousy kisser

46:22.057 --> 46:24.685
or else she'd be back by now.

46:24.768 --> 46:26.561
Hey, Charlie,

46:26.562 --> 46:29.648
you look just like
Adolphe Menjou in this ad.

46:29.773 --> 46:32.359
That's 'cause
it is Adolphe Menjou.

46:32.485 --> 46:35.279
No wonder I never heard
of the picture. Who wants to see

46:35.362 --> 46:37.865
a Charlie Chaplin production
without Charlie Chaplin?

46:51.032 --> 46:53.200
Type it up, will you?

46:53.701 --> 46:55.661
Shit.

46:57.755 --> 47:00.383
Just be strong
and keep telling him no.

47:00.384 --> 47:02.343
- Understand?
- Yeah.

47:06.848 --> 47:09.997
Four people on the bed
and Chaplin's the only one asleep.

47:09.998 --> 47:12.353
That's something
you don't see every day.

47:19.861 --> 47:21.821
WR?

47:23.072 --> 47:25.763
A wire's come through
from the New York office.

47:25.764 --> 47:27.827
It's an item
that will be published

47:27.869 --> 47:30.370
in tomorrow's
New York Daily News.

47:30.371 --> 47:33.540
- Grace Kingsley.
- Oh God!

47:33.541 --> 47:36.377
Which one of my pictures
is she bashing now?

47:37.545 --> 47:40.256
- I'll leave it here for you.
- No, no, go ahead and read it.

47:46.179 --> 47:48.472
"Charlie Chaplin
continues to pay

47:48.473 --> 47:51.183
ardent attention
to Marion Davies.

47:51.184 --> 47:53.894
He's spent the evening
at Montmartre dining and dancing

47:53.895 --> 47:55.979
with the fair Marion
the other night.

47:55.980 --> 47:58.899
There was a lovely young dancer
entertaining that evening.

47:58.900 --> 48:01.549
And Charlie applauded
but with his back turned.

48:01.550 --> 48:04.696
He never took his eyes off
Marion's blonde beauty.

48:04.697 --> 48:07.491
Miss Davies looked
very fetching indeed."

48:07.492 --> 48:09.576
Photos?

48:09.577 --> 48:11.912
Studio close-ups
of each of them.

48:11.913 --> 48:14.373
- Placed side by side?
- Yeah.

48:14.374 --> 48:16.792
Caption?

48:16.793 --> 48:19.420
"They're still seen around
with each other."

48:22.090 --> 48:23.925
I'll leave it here for you.

48:23.926 --> 48:25.884
Fine, fine.
You can go now.

48:25.885 --> 48:28.680
- Shall I make a call?
- Get out!!

48:49.701 --> 48:51.786
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

48:51.787 --> 48:54.289
Two men starving to death

48:54.330 --> 48:57.876
decide to eat their hair
like spaghetti. Is that funny?

48:57.877 --> 48:58.917
Hmm... well,

48:58.918 --> 49:02.631
it depends whether by "funny,"
you want to make people laugh.

49:02.632 --> 49:04.382
Sarcasm doesn't
suit your hat, Elinor.

49:15.602 --> 49:18.228
I want to show you
something absolutely fantastic.

49:18.229 --> 49:20.606
Bring the cannon out here!

49:20.607 --> 49:23.860
Ladies, don't be frightened.
Mr. Cannonball!

50:02.649 --> 50:05.276
Bring it up here, boys.
How is it going?

50:05.277 --> 50:06.903
Stop.
Get back, boys.

50:06.945 --> 50:08.612
Get out of the way.

50:08.613 --> 50:11.324
Put those down there.

50:11.366 --> 50:13.326
- Ready, Mr. Cannonball?
- I'm ready.

50:13.327 --> 50:16.537
All right. Get back,
you'll get blown up.

50:16.538 --> 50:19.540
Only us brave performers
are gonna stay up here.

50:19.541 --> 50:21.292
- Ready, Mr. Cannonball?
- I'm ready!

50:30.635 --> 50:32.428
Amazing!

50:33.972 --> 50:36.223
Amazing, amazing!

50:36.224 --> 50:39.977
Every single time! By jingles!

50:39.978 --> 50:42.354
I don't know how many times
I've seen you do that

50:42.355 --> 50:44.732
but it never
ceases to amaze me.

50:44.774 --> 50:47.776
I believe I saw you before
on Catalina last summer.

50:47.777 --> 50:50.697
Yep. Catalina,
up and down the coast from Frisco

50:50.698 --> 50:52.949
clear on down to Ensenada.

50:52.991 --> 50:55.493
Wherever you see a cannonball
hit a man's stomach

50:55.494 --> 50:58.954
and you see that same man
walk away on both legs,

50:58.955 --> 51:00.498
you're seeing me.

51:00.582 --> 51:02.040
Didn't I tell you?

51:02.041 --> 51:04.335
- Tom, that was good.
- Wonderful.

51:04.377 --> 51:06.296
You've seen it
1 00 times...

51:06.297 --> 51:08.255
How many more times
do you suppose it'll take

51:08.256 --> 51:11.175
before the cannonball explodes
through the poor man's back?

51:11.176 --> 51:14.074
I don't know, but Hearst will be there
with a match in his hand.

51:14.075 --> 51:15.847
That is what
he's waiting to see.

51:27.609 --> 51:29.068
George.

51:33.573 --> 51:35.450
You know, Margaret,

51:35.492 --> 51:38.076
there's a certain
unspoken bond

51:38.077 --> 51:41.122
between single women who
are trapped on a yacht together.

51:41.123 --> 51:43.081
What Didi wants to know is,

51:43.082 --> 51:45.667
is it true
you're Tom Ince's lover?

51:45.668 --> 51:48.713
- I beg your pardon?
- I think he's very attractive.

51:48.714 --> 51:51.089
Not to mention influential.

51:51.090 --> 51:53.927
He's a little short,
but then every man in this town

51:53.928 --> 51:57.012
is much smaller
than you'd like him to be.

51:57.013 --> 51:58.556
Excuse me.

52:05.480 --> 52:07.898
Have you lost your mind?!

52:07.899 --> 52:10.068
I've tried your approach.
It doesn't work.

52:10.069 --> 52:12.716
I have to show him I can handle
his private life too.

52:12.717 --> 52:15.614
- Marion only affects him.
- By proving Marion's unfaithful?!

52:15.615 --> 52:17.784
Which will make him
hate you forever.

52:17.826 --> 52:20.828
I know you're looking
for some harpoon,

52:20.829 --> 52:23.705
but this one
is dangerously double-edged.

52:23.706 --> 52:26.708
- Tom, we need to talk.
- Not now, Margaret.

52:26.709 --> 52:28.586
Look...

52:37.428 --> 52:39.805
Hi, everyone!
Did I miss it?

52:39.806 --> 52:41.558
Marion!

52:41.641 --> 52:43.935
- He can do it again.
- Shut up.

52:45.645 --> 52:47.438
Oh, you just missed it!

52:47.439 --> 52:49.858
It's amazing how I manage
to miss it every time.

52:55.947 --> 52:59.575
Hello. I don't think
we've been properly introduced.

52:59.576 --> 53:02.245
I'm Jessica Barham,
Frank Barham's wife.

53:02.328 --> 53:04.831
- Margaret Livingston.
- Charmed.

53:04.956 --> 53:07.959
And what is it
that you do?

53:08.042 --> 53:10.462
I'm Tom Ince's lover.

53:19.846 --> 53:22.140
You're listening
to KFI's studio orchestra

53:22.307 --> 53:24.309
with our weekend
musical number,

53:24.392 --> 53:27.020
Right here
on the voice of the southland.

54:31.835 --> 54:33.336
Willie?

55:19.466 --> 55:21.050
WR!

55:21.217 --> 55:23.011
I've been looking
all over for you.

55:23.094 --> 55:25.013
How about that tour
you've been promising?

55:25.096 --> 55:27.891
- Oh, yeah.
- I've been meaning to tell you...

55:31.311 --> 55:33.021
I have news...

55:33.104 --> 55:36.024
If you were starving and had no food,
would you eat your shoe?

55:36.107 --> 55:38.526
- What?!
- Your shoe. Would you eat it?

55:38.651 --> 55:40.653
- Of course I would.
- You would?

55:40.737 --> 55:42.739
- I'd have to boil it.
- That's funny.

55:42.740 --> 55:44.616
Well, this isn't.

55:45.742 --> 55:48.452
Oohh!
Daily News gets the scoop.

55:48.453 --> 55:51.247
Embarrassing for Willie,
not even a Hearst newspaper.

55:51.331 --> 55:54.334
If Willie asks you, I want you
to tell him what I've told him,

55:54.501 --> 55:57.504
- That it's all cheap gossip.
- You lie if you want to,

55:57.545 --> 55:59.172
if he asks me I'll look right
in those impotent eyes

55:59.255 --> 56:01.966
and tell him I want to take
his girl, rip off her dress...

56:02.000 --> 56:03.209
Don't!!

56:03.334 --> 56:05.753
Don't punish me
for being with Willie!

56:05.754 --> 56:08.423
You're scared 'cause you can't
admit that you love me.

56:08.424 --> 56:10.884
I can say it!
I love you, Marion!

56:11.051 --> 56:14.053
- I love Willie!
- He could never love only you!

56:14.054 --> 56:16.931
He has his papers and his
politicians and his wife and kids.

56:17.057 --> 56:19.142
I can give you all my love.

56:19.267 --> 56:20.977
Did you promise Lita
all your love

56:21.102 --> 56:23.480
and then take it away
now that she's pregnant?!

56:23.504 --> 56:25.673
That was a mistake!

56:28.342 --> 56:30.011
My fascination with Lita

56:30.136 --> 56:33.806
is caused by some part of me
that's trying to tear my life apart.

56:33.807 --> 56:35.891
But I could never love her.

56:35.933 --> 56:38.644
I could never marry her.
If I did it would destroy

56:38.728 --> 56:41.813
- Everything I've worked for.
- It's all about you, Charlie!

56:41.814 --> 56:46.110
No. I came from nothing!
You have no idea what poverty is.

56:46.277 --> 56:48.487
I know what dirt
tastes like and you don't!

56:48.529 --> 56:51.032
Everything I've worked for,
I've earned myself!

56:51.065 --> 56:53.484
Yeah, and Willie
had nothing to do with it?

56:53.526 --> 56:55.820
You wanna know about Willie?
Willie can always be trusted.

56:55.853 --> 56:58.146
I give to him
because he doesn't demand it.

56:58.147 --> 57:00.274
He doesn't demand it?
He expects it!

57:00.289 --> 57:04.085
- Go to hell!
- Here's my mansion and my yacht,

57:04.094 --> 57:06.888
here's my Marion Davies
all stuffed and mounted.

57:06.901 --> 57:08.987
But Marion could never
leave the castle

57:09.112 --> 57:11.488
'cause if she did she'd realize
she'd never really lived.

57:11.489 --> 57:14.576
Why are you doing this to me?
Because we're meant to be.

57:14.926 --> 57:17.512
Just words...
No, passion!

57:17.637 --> 57:20.015
I don't mean
passion for... yachts

57:20.140 --> 57:21.640
or gin or dope

57:21.641 --> 57:23.518
or the goddamn Charleston!

57:23.602 --> 57:25.604
I'm talking about...

57:25.729 --> 57:28.231
I'm talking about...

57:35.238 --> 57:36.823
Now that,

57:36.907 --> 57:39.825
boy, that is
a thing of beauty, WR.

57:39.826 --> 57:42.829
I tell you,
I may be married to Nell,

57:42.913 --> 57:45.123
but boating is my secret love.

57:45.207 --> 57:48.209
What? Oh, yes.
Secret love.

57:48.210 --> 57:50.711
And this boat...

57:50.712 --> 57:53.131
has always
made me happy. Calm.

57:53.653 --> 57:55.655
My God,
it practically purrs!

57:55.738 --> 57:59.157
When I come down here,
this sound calms me.

57:59.158 --> 58:01.244
You're a civilized man, WR.

58:01.327 --> 58:03.162
Why does that surprise you?

58:03.246 --> 58:06.457
Because, you have the power
to act uncivilized.

58:06.540 --> 58:09.542
You could overstep the rules,
but you don't.

58:09.543 --> 58:12.046
Before I'd call you
a rich or a powerful man,

58:12.129 --> 58:14.257
I'd simply call you decent.

58:14.340 --> 58:17.134
Thank you, Tom.
I'm not just saying that.

58:17.260 --> 58:19.637
It's amazing to me
how civilized

58:19.762 --> 58:21.931
you've been
behaving all weekend.

58:22.056 --> 58:24.433
I mean... considering.
Considering what?

58:27.061 --> 58:29.145
Well, it's clear...

58:29.146 --> 58:31.232
Chaplin has designs on Marion.

58:31.357 --> 58:33.149
I mean...

58:33.150 --> 58:35.444
the nerve of him
flirting so blatantly.

58:35.528 --> 58:37.238
After you.

58:37.363 --> 58:39.740
Everyone knows
what he's up to.

58:39.824 --> 58:42.243
It must be so infuriating.

58:42.326 --> 58:44.245
Yes, I have everything
under control.

58:44.328 --> 58:46.664
What do you mean "everyone"?
What?

58:46.747 --> 58:49.125
You just said "everyone" knows.
Who's everyone?

58:49.250 --> 58:50.625
Well...

58:50.626 --> 58:52.628
everyone on this boat
for example.

58:52.753 --> 58:55.464
If someone
was coming after my Nell,

58:55.548 --> 58:58.258
I don't know that
I'd be able to exercise such...

58:58.259 --> 59:00.928
impressive restraint.

59:01.053 --> 59:03.431
You always
have to keep control.

59:05.725 --> 59:07.934
Otherwise you're
just like everybody else.

59:07.935 --> 59:09.353
Excuse me...

59:09.437 --> 59:13.149
Could I get into the library?
Damn! I locked it!

59:13.232 --> 59:15.735
Sorry about that, Dan.
I'll see you up top, Tom.

59:15.860 --> 59:18.654
"Up Top, Tom," try to say
that three times fast.

59:20.364 --> 59:22.033
WR?

59:25.828 --> 59:27.538
Thanks for the weekend.

59:27.663 --> 59:29.332
Ohh.

01:00:12.124 --> 01:00:15.044
Thanks for playing with me.
Don't mention it.

01:00:15.127 --> 01:00:17.338
It really is
rather dull, isn't it?

01:00:17.463 --> 01:00:19.465
What is?
Ping-pong.

01:00:19.548 --> 01:00:22.635
- I thought you wanted to play.
- I did. I want to get better.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.055
Anybody who's anybody
plays ping-pong.

01:00:26.138 --> 01:00:29.141
It is rather dull. I only play
'cause I can beat Tom.

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:30.726
- Tom Ince?
- That's right.

01:00:30.851 --> 01:00:33.562
Why should it matter
if you can beat Tom Ince?

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:35.856
Because Tom Ince is my lover.

01:00:37.149 --> 01:00:39.026
That is fascinating.

01:00:39.151 --> 01:00:41.362
I mean,
that is truly fascinating.

01:00:41.445 --> 01:00:43.530
We only just met,

01:00:43.531 --> 01:00:48.034
and yet you instinctively
feel like you can trust me.

01:00:48.035 --> 01:00:50.161
You know something,
Margaret,

01:00:50.162 --> 01:00:52.331
that's happened to me
all my life.

01:00:52.456 --> 01:00:54.834
People feel
that they can confide

01:00:54.959 --> 01:00:57.128
their deepest
darkest secrets in me.

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:58.838
Like you just did.

01:00:58.963 --> 01:01:01.549
I hate to burst your bubble,
I would have told whoever

01:01:01.632 --> 01:01:03.759
was on the other side
of that ping-pong table.

01:01:03.843 --> 01:01:05.760
Yes, but how fortunate

01:01:05.761 --> 01:01:07.763
that I just learned how
to play ping-pong

01:01:07.847 --> 01:01:10.558
or else you might have told
the wrong person.

01:01:10.641 --> 01:01:14.061
There are wrong people,
you know.

01:01:15.062 --> 01:01:17.064
Yes, I know.

01:01:17.148 --> 01:01:19.859
Don't worry,
your secret is safe with me.

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:21.652
My serve?

01:01:35.249 --> 01:01:37.126
Marion! Marion!

01:01:37.251 --> 01:01:39.127
Bring it in!

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:42.048
Happy birthday, Tom!

01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:46.552
Make a wish!

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:49.847
All right, here it goes.

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:58.856
Would you take it to be cut?
Thank you.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:03.652
All right, hold it down back there.
Hold it down.

01:02:03.653 --> 01:02:05.528
I want to propose
a birthday toast

01:02:05.529 --> 01:02:08.241
to my good friend
and cowboy creator,

01:02:08.366 --> 01:02:10.326
- Thomas Harper Ince,

01:02:10.451 --> 01:02:13.162
one of the giants
of the motion picture industry.

01:02:14.247 --> 01:02:16.832
To just give you an idea
of how big he is,

01:02:16.958 --> 01:02:19.960
he's just made a proposal
that we merge our holdings

01:02:19.961 --> 01:02:21.963
in the motion picture industry.

01:02:22.046 --> 01:02:24.465
We haven't come
to an agreement yet,

01:02:24.548 --> 01:02:27.843
but I can say, that he's one of
the most insightful and...

01:02:27.927 --> 01:02:30.930
observant men
I've ever known.

01:02:32.265 --> 01:02:33.849
Perhaps now's the time...

01:02:33.933 --> 01:02:36.435
I hereby call this meeting
of the board of directors

01:02:36.561 --> 01:02:39.855
Officially over!
All right, all right.

01:02:39.939 --> 01:02:42.858
Music, music!
Here's to Tom!

01:02:44.235 --> 01:02:46.152
Thank you, WR.

01:02:46.153 --> 01:02:48.030
You're too generous.

01:03:07.133 --> 01:03:09.427
Now the real thing on everyone's
mind is whether or not

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:12.847
Willie will let us have
another glass of champagne?

01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:16.641
Is that what's on everybody's mind?
A second glass of champagne?

01:03:16.642 --> 01:03:19.645
Well, it's on my mind,
I can tell you that.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:23.649
I do not ask much.

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:26.234
But the little I do ask I...

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:28.362
must be respected.

01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:31.449
I don't say this...

01:03:31.532 --> 01:03:33.326
as a threat,

01:03:33.451 --> 01:03:36.245
It's just a wish
I have as a man.

01:03:41.459 --> 01:03:43.127
I...

01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:45.546
I...

01:03:47.548 --> 01:03:49.549
I'm a man
asking for people to...

01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:51.552
behave according to my wishes...

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:55.639
on my boat.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.726
Why is that
so difficult to understand?

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:04.065
Charleston! Charleston!

01:04:04.148 --> 01:04:06.150
Charleston!

01:04:06.234 --> 01:04:08.527
Dah-da-da-da-da...

01:04:29.048 --> 01:04:31.550
Excuse me for one moment.

01:04:31.551 --> 01:04:33.135
I'll be right back.

01:04:33.261 --> 01:04:36.639
- Everything all right, Tom?
- Yeah. Damn ulcer. It'll pass.

01:04:42.562 --> 01:04:44.354
Watch it, Charlie,

01:04:44.355 --> 01:04:46.857
we're doing the tramp now.

01:05:12.049 --> 01:05:14.051
I'm proud of you.

01:05:14.135 --> 01:05:16.554
Proud of what?
I'm observant, I'm insightful

01:05:16.637 --> 01:05:18.431
but I still
don't have a deal yet.

01:05:18.556 --> 01:05:21.767
- Tom, for God's sake...
- You don't understand.

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:25.938
I need a firm decision from him
or this whole weekend is worthless.

01:05:26.063 --> 01:05:29.150
- Let's dance, Georgie-Porgie.
- Certainly.

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:37.533
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:05:37.658 --> 01:05:39.826
I give you Marion Davies,

01:05:39.827 --> 01:05:41.746
The New Tramp.

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:29.543
WR.

01:06:29.669 --> 01:06:31.545
Hello, Tom.

01:06:31.629 --> 01:06:34.757
I have to thank you again
for making this birthday so memorable.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.342
Don't mention it.

01:06:36.467 --> 01:06:38.636
I also want to thank you
for your kind words

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:41.054
about my business proposition.

01:06:41.055 --> 01:06:43.557
I really think
we'd make a great team.

01:06:43.558 --> 01:06:45.935
Yes, Tom.

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:49.354
Partnerships of any kind
are based on two things,

01:06:49.355 --> 01:06:50.855
trust...

01:06:50.856 --> 01:06:52.733
and sharing.

01:06:53.859 --> 01:06:57.029
If you had information to share
with me I'd trust you to do so.

01:06:58.155 --> 01:07:01.450
That's why I think it best that
I bring something to your attention.

01:07:02.535 --> 01:07:05.246
While you've been busy
being such a gracious host,

01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:08.165
I've been keeping an eye
on another situation.

01:07:30.354 --> 01:07:32.356
Thank you, Tom.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.733
I needed to know.

01:07:34.859 --> 01:07:36.444
Now I'll...

01:07:36.569 --> 01:07:39.030
I'll handle this matter.

01:07:45.453 --> 01:07:46.953
You see what I want,

01:07:46.954 --> 01:07:50.041
I want Mr. Hearst to listen to me
but I don't want to be rude.

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:52.668
You'll get nowhere with WR
by behaving politely.

01:07:52.752 --> 01:07:53.961
Really?

01:07:54.045 --> 01:07:56.047
Good manners are
for waiters and doormen.

01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:59.467
Writers and artists are exonerated
from such impractical behavior.

01:08:03.137 --> 01:08:05.556
Best to avert your eyes, dear.

01:08:07.058 --> 01:08:09.143
But what about the baby, Charlie?

01:08:09.268 --> 01:08:11.854
Willie'll turn the lead
into the biggest scandal.

01:08:11.938 --> 01:08:14.565
The press knows already.
There hasn't been a scandal yet.

01:08:14.649 --> 01:08:16.567
It'll be a scandal
if you don't marry her.

01:08:16.651 --> 01:08:19.444
Or worse, if you run off
with some gorgeous blonde.

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:21.863
They'll rip you to pieces.

01:08:21.948 --> 01:08:24.533
You'll look so pretty
while you're digging my grave.

01:08:24.658 --> 01:08:26.452
Stop.

01:08:54.063 --> 01:08:55.939
Come in.

01:08:57.567 --> 01:08:59.149
I did it.

01:08:59.151 --> 01:09:00.861
I got to Hearst.

01:09:02.446 --> 01:09:04.657
You didn't get him just yet.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:07.450
I've taken care of any worries
the old man might have.

01:09:07.451 --> 01:09:10.453
I'm glad someone's worries
have been taken care of.

01:09:10.453 --> 01:09:13.165
Oh, come on, honey.
I mean...

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:15.167
I'm feeling good right now.

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:17.252
Don't spoil it for me, okay?

01:09:17.336 --> 01:09:19.130
I wouldn't want
to spoil anything.

01:09:19.255 --> 01:09:21.131
I'm having the best time,

01:09:21.256 --> 01:09:22.966
playing ping-pong
with Lolly Parsons

01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:25.845
and hanging around for those
moments you want to screw!

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:30.265
I'm sorry that in the middle of
trying to save my professional life

01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:32.935
I wasn't able to give
your acting career a boost.

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.145
This isn't about
my acting career, God damn you!

01:09:35.145 --> 01:09:37.148
This is about us!

01:09:38.232 --> 01:09:41.151
I... really don't have
time for this.

01:09:41.152 --> 01:09:43.069
I want out.

01:09:43.069 --> 01:09:44.863
Not again.

01:09:44.863 --> 01:09:48.533
- No, not again. This is it.
- I'm liable to take you seriously.

01:09:48.658 --> 01:09:50.870
Really?
That would be the first time.

01:09:52.747 --> 01:09:54.247
All right.

01:09:54.332 --> 01:09:57.835
I can see that you're in no mood
to discuss this rationally so,

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.464
I'll take a walk on deck,
let you calm down.

01:10:01.547 --> 01:10:03.841
But, if you still want out,

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:06.134
please have the decency
to be discreet.

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:09.347
Why, I'm the very flower
of decency.

01:10:14.852 --> 01:10:17.230
Here's your
goddamn birthday present!

01:10:33.246 --> 01:10:35.456
Shut the hell up!

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:17.331
We've got to say the hell
with the press and Lita and Willie

01:11:17.456 --> 01:11:19.750
- 'cause we believe in us.
- Charlie...

01:11:19.834 --> 01:11:21.252
I know, I know.
Time, time...

01:11:21.335 --> 01:11:24.046
My mother always said,
"Romantic love fades.

01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:26.256
Marry for sympathy
and friendship."

01:11:26.257 --> 01:11:28.634
But you're not married.

01:11:28.759 --> 01:11:30.761
Yet.

01:11:30.845 --> 01:11:32.555
Uh-hmm.

01:11:46.944 --> 01:11:49.447
Maybe Marion's awake.

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:17.350
I loved Willie...
or I still love him.

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:20.268
- You gotta think about us now.
- Hey, have faith in me, okay?

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:22.563
I have faith.
What do you think about this?

01:12:22.647 --> 01:12:25.942
"The Gold Rush," starring
Charlie Chaplin and Marion Davies.

01:12:26.067 --> 01:12:29.569
- What?!
- I gotta replace Lita.

01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:32.240
- So, I'm your second choice?
- You would've been my first if...

01:12:32.365 --> 01:12:34.659
If I had slept with you sooner.

01:12:34.742 --> 01:12:36.744
Yeah.

01:12:44.168 --> 01:12:45.670
We were good tonight.

01:12:46.754 --> 01:12:48.631
Well, I was good.

01:12:48.756 --> 01:12:51.050
I was better.

01:13:11.737 --> 01:13:13.739
Oh my God!

01:13:22.039 --> 01:13:23.457
Marion?

01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:27.460
- Tom. It's you.
- Who were you expecting?

01:13:27.461 --> 01:13:29.964
No one.
I... had a chill for a moment.

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:36.762
Can I be frank with you?

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:41.267
If I'm going to be
overseeing your pictures,

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:44.437
I need for us to come to terms
about a few things.

01:13:44.562 --> 01:13:46.647
Things that are...

01:13:46.772 --> 01:13:49.066
troubling WR.

01:13:49.150 --> 01:13:50.568
Like?

01:13:51.652 --> 01:13:53.570
Like you and...

01:13:53.571 --> 01:13:55.156
Charlie.

01:14:04.332 --> 01:14:07.835
And I'd be the first to admit
that I had my share of indiscretions.

01:14:09.837 --> 01:14:12.173
But I need
to know the truth

01:14:12.256 --> 01:14:14.550
in order to balance
your needs with...

01:14:14.634 --> 01:14:16.636
with those of WR.

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.606
He will find out, you know.

01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:32.818
And when he does, I'd rather be
someone who can help you.

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:37.907
How do I look?
Silly, right?

01:14:51.295 --> 01:14:53.923
Charlie had certain feelings for me.

01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:57.927
But I've convinced him
that it's useless to pursue me.

01:15:07.895 --> 01:15:09.730
He says he loves me.

01:15:09.814 --> 01:15:12.315
But there was never any love.

01:15:12.316 --> 01:15:14.402
At least not from my side
there wasn't.

01:15:14.527 --> 01:15:17.196
I don't love him.
I never have.

01:15:17.321 --> 01:15:19.407
So... that's it.

01:15:22.326 --> 01:15:24.412
That's really all there is.

01:15:44.891 --> 01:15:46.225
Noo! Nooo!!

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:48.895
What? Be quiet!!

01:16:02.909 --> 01:16:05.411
Oh my God, Willie,
what the hell did you do?

01:16:32.813 --> 01:16:34.398
Yes?

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:36.692
I'll be right there.

01:16:44.325 --> 01:16:45.826
Hello?

01:16:46.827 --> 01:16:48.912
What?!
Hurry! Please!

01:16:48.913 --> 01:16:50.915
Oh, Christ's sake!

01:17:16.524 --> 01:17:19.025
I didn't mean to do it.

01:17:19.026 --> 01:17:20.695
It was an accident.

01:17:42.925 --> 01:17:44.510
Ahhh!!

01:17:45.595 --> 01:17:47.597
Oh, for God's sake!

01:17:47.722 --> 01:17:49.014
Joe.

01:17:49.015 --> 01:17:50.308
Shut her up.

01:18:02.194 --> 01:18:04.614
Is he dead?
No.

01:18:06.198 --> 01:18:08.701
It's okay, Lolly.
It's all right.

01:18:11.412 --> 01:18:13.497
Ahh!

01:18:13.623 --> 01:18:16.709
Shh... it's okay.

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:19.295
Come on,
let's get you to your room.

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:23.214
We've got to get him
to some real facilities.

01:18:23.215 --> 01:18:24.799
Where's the closest port?

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.929
Chief?
Where's the closest port?

01:18:30.223 --> 01:18:32.225
It must be San Diego.

01:18:33.309 --> 01:18:36.103
Come on, Pops,
let's stand up.

01:18:40.107 --> 01:18:42.401
Here, let's go this way.

01:18:51.994 --> 01:18:53.704
Willie...

01:18:53.829 --> 01:18:55.998
- That was Tom.
- Willie.

01:18:56.123 --> 01:18:57.916
That was Tom.

01:18:57.917 --> 01:18:59.502
Look at me.

01:18:59.627 --> 01:19:02.421
- Huh? What?
- You've got to be strong.

01:19:03.631 --> 01:19:05.424
Why?

01:19:06.425 --> 01:19:08.510
Why did you say...

01:19:08.511 --> 01:19:11.097
there was never any love?

01:19:14.725 --> 01:19:17.395
That wasn't about you.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.522
Who then?

01:19:19.605 --> 01:19:21.315
Charlie.

01:19:21.399 --> 01:19:23.818
I was talking about Charlie.

01:19:23.901 --> 01:19:25.611
Is that true?

01:19:25.695 --> 01:19:28.823
Yes! That's who
I was talking about.

01:19:31.993 --> 01:19:34.120
You see,

01:19:34.203 --> 01:19:36.496
you are my...

01:19:36.497 --> 01:19:39.125
my whole...
whole world!

01:19:53.514 --> 01:19:55.307
Is he gonna die?

01:19:55.308 --> 01:19:57.810
- Maybe.
- God help us.

01:19:57.894 --> 01:20:00.812
- God is who we work for.
- Then God's in trouble.

01:20:00.813 --> 01:20:04.317
Come on, who do you think
got Coolidge elected President?

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.027
It's just Tom Ince
lying here, right?

01:20:07.028 --> 01:20:10.530
- Who knows Tom Ince?
- Just a guy, I guess.

01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:12.617
Less than that.

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:14.410
lf...

01:20:14.493 --> 01:20:16.912
if we move him,
what are his chances?

01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:19.332
It's hard to say, WR,

01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:21.918
there doesn't seem
to be an exit wound.

01:20:23.002 --> 01:20:25.421
The bullet's in his brain
and he's still alive?

01:20:25.504 --> 01:20:28.633
It's not uncommon.
Lincoln didn't die right away.

01:20:28.716 --> 01:20:31.802
If they'd known more about bullets
and brains he might've survived.

01:20:31.928 --> 01:20:35.223
- We know any surgeons in San Diego?
- Nobody we can trust.

01:20:35.306 --> 01:20:38.808
I'd rather get a private ambulance
from Los Angeles and treat him up there.

01:20:38.809 --> 01:20:42.020
Then get cars for the others
two hours later. No sooner, Joe.

01:20:42.021 --> 01:20:43.814
Lincoln was overrated.

01:20:43.898 --> 01:20:46.817
Let's move Tom now so we can
get him off the boat fast.

01:20:46.901 --> 01:20:49.319
- Your cabin would be best.
- All right.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.530
I think he's trying
to say something.

01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:53.031
WR,

01:20:53.032 --> 01:20:55.993
why don't you take Marion
to her cabin and...

01:20:56.118 --> 01:20:58.495
you give her these.

01:20:58.496 --> 01:21:00.331
It'll help her sleep.

01:21:00.414 --> 01:21:01.999
You can handle that?

01:21:02.124 --> 01:21:04.502
Of course I can.
I'm not a child!

01:21:04.627 --> 01:21:07.129
Tom's gonna be all right.
Aren't you, Tom?

01:21:27.525 --> 01:21:30.111
Is everything all right?
I thought I heard noises.

01:21:30.194 --> 01:21:32.697
Everything's fine, George.
Go to sleep.

01:21:42.707 --> 01:21:45.001
l... I'm sorry...

01:21:45.126 --> 01:21:47.211
I just...

01:21:48.504 --> 01:21:50.423
Poor Tom...

01:21:50.506 --> 01:21:52.008
I feel so...

01:21:52.133 --> 01:21:53.926
He's gonna live.

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:55.928
I know it.

01:21:56.929 --> 01:21:58.930
Dr. Goodman told me.

01:21:58.931 --> 01:22:01.726
He said that...

01:22:01.809 --> 01:22:05.021
Abraham Lincoln was...
never mind that.

01:22:07.315 --> 01:22:09.024
Here.

01:22:09.025 --> 01:22:10.818
You have to take these.

01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:38.512
- Grab him!
- I got him.

01:22:40.431 --> 01:22:42.934
Yes?
Is someone there?

01:22:43.017 --> 01:22:45.311
It's just Dr. Goodman...

01:22:48.231 --> 01:22:50.316
...sorry to wake you.

01:22:50.399 --> 01:22:52.235
That's all right.

01:23:27.103 --> 01:23:29.814
All right.
Okay.

01:23:30.898 --> 01:23:33.025
I'll get things started.

01:25:56.502 --> 01:25:58.504
- WR?
- Hmm?

01:25:59.630 --> 01:26:00.923
Joe, yes, yes.

01:26:09.307 --> 01:26:11.934
Be careful,
just lift him very gently.

01:26:13.311 --> 01:26:14.937
That's it.

01:26:16.314 --> 01:26:18.900
Be careful.
Watch his head.

01:26:20.735 --> 01:26:22.528
What the hell?!

01:26:22.612 --> 01:26:25.615
I thought we said the cars
wouldn't be here for two hours.

01:26:25.698 --> 01:26:27.825
I don't know
what he's doing here so soon.

01:26:29.619 --> 01:26:32.621
He's not one of mine.
I called Chaplin's driver.

01:26:32.622 --> 01:26:36.125
- God damn it, Joe!
- He always insists on his own man.

01:26:36.208 --> 01:26:39.837
I didn't want to arouse
any more suspicion than necessary.

01:26:42.506 --> 01:26:45.927
Oh no.
No suspicion at all!

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:58.522
Hello? Hello?

01:26:58.606 --> 01:27:00.608
Nell? WR Hearst here.

01:27:00.733 --> 01:27:02.735
Mr. Hearst, how are you?

01:27:02.818 --> 01:27:04.904
- I'm fine, Nell.
- I'm glad to hear it.

01:27:05.029 --> 01:27:08.032
Unfortunately, Tom's had
an accident. A bad one.

01:27:08.115 --> 01:27:10.034
Oh dear God! What happened?

01:27:10.117 --> 01:27:12.202
- Nell,
- Yes?

01:27:12.203 --> 01:27:15.831
I don't know to tell you this,
except to start by saying that

01:27:15.915 --> 01:27:19.001
Tom's been very depressed
about his business lately.

01:27:19.126 --> 01:27:20.835
I know.

01:27:20.836 --> 01:27:23.713
Well, I hate to be
the one to tell you,

01:27:23.714 --> 01:27:26.633
- He's been unfaithful.
- What do you mean?!

01:27:26.634 --> 01:27:28.928
Just let me get there,
will you?

01:27:30.429 --> 01:27:31.514
He uh...

01:27:31.597 --> 01:27:33.432
he's taken to her
very strongly,

01:27:33.516 --> 01:27:36.811
and to the best of my knowledge...
she tried to end it.

01:27:36.936 --> 01:27:39.438
Please, tell me
what's happened to Tom.

01:27:39.522 --> 01:27:40.606
Now, Nell...

01:27:40.731 --> 01:27:42.733
well, God-save-'im,
he shot himself.

01:27:42.817 --> 01:27:44.402
Huh? Shot himself?

01:27:44.527 --> 01:27:47.238
Nell, he's alive,

01:27:47.321 --> 01:27:49.115
and he's getting
the best of care.

01:27:49.198 --> 01:27:51.908
Our Dr. Goodman
is escorting him to your home

01:27:51.909 --> 01:27:54.036
by private ambulance.

01:27:55.204 --> 01:27:56.831
Nell?

01:27:57.915 --> 01:27:59.625
I'm here.

01:28:01.335 --> 01:28:04.130
Give me the name of his
private physician. Can you do that?

01:28:04.213 --> 01:28:08.217
Yes. It's Dr. Glasgow...

01:28:08.301 --> 01:28:09.427
Ira Glasgow in...

01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:11.012
That's fine.

01:28:11.137 --> 01:28:14.515
By God, Nell, I'll make sure
none of this gets in the papers.

01:28:14.599 --> 01:28:17.602
Oh my God, you have to!
- I just said I would, Nell.

01:28:17.727 --> 01:28:19.020
Now...

01:28:19.103 --> 01:28:21.813
you've got to remain strong
and silent,

01:28:21.814 --> 01:28:24.400
and wait for Dr. Glasgow.

01:28:24.525 --> 01:28:26.736
We'll have him there
any time now.

01:28:26.819 --> 01:28:29.321
I'll wait for the doctor...
bless you, Mr. Hearst.

01:28:29.322 --> 01:28:31.823
No one will ever find out.

01:28:31.824 --> 01:28:34.619
I value Tom's friendship
too much for that.

01:28:34.702 --> 01:28:37.622
- Sorry, what did you say?
- His friendship, Nell!!

01:28:37.705 --> 01:28:39.206
- Of course...
- We...

01:28:39.332 --> 01:28:43.002
we're telling everyone
that it's his stomach.

01:28:43.127 --> 01:28:45.838
- His ulcers.
- Ulcers, yes.

01:28:45.922 --> 01:28:47.797
I know this is hard,

01:28:47.798 --> 01:28:50.801
but I've got to hang up now
and call Dr. Glasgow.

01:28:50.927 --> 01:28:53.720
- You just sit and wait.
- Just sit and wait...

01:28:53.721 --> 01:28:55.932
- Goodbye, Nell.
- Tom. Poor Tom...

01:28:57.934 --> 01:29:00.102
Goodbye.

01:29:36.514 --> 01:29:38.224
Yes?

01:29:39.225 --> 01:29:41.227
Good morning, Chief.

01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:44.021
You seem well rested.

01:29:44.105 --> 01:29:46.106
Yes, well...

01:29:46.107 --> 01:29:48.526
whatever Dr. Goodman gave me

01:29:48.609 --> 01:29:51.404
put me right to sleep,
thank goodness.

01:29:52.905 --> 01:29:54.532
I'm so glad.

01:29:56.826 --> 01:29:59.911
It was a tragic accident,
Mr. Hearst.

01:29:59.912 --> 01:30:02.122
Yes, Lolly?

01:30:02.123 --> 01:30:03.833
Still...

01:30:03.916 --> 01:30:07.211
these things do happen,
as they say.

01:30:07.336 --> 01:30:11.632
It's nobody's fault, really,
when you consider all sides.

01:30:11.716 --> 01:30:14.802
You're very good at that,
considering all sides.

01:30:14.927 --> 01:30:19.931
You meet so few people
capable of considering all sides.

01:30:19.932 --> 01:30:21.601
It's a goddamn gift.

01:30:23.102 --> 01:30:25.313
Mr. Hearst,

01:30:25.438 --> 01:30:27.814
I must confess, and...

01:30:27.815 --> 01:30:30.526
I know I've been
a bit obvious but l...

01:30:30.610 --> 01:30:32.611
you have a second to talk?

01:30:32.612 --> 01:30:35.323
I have two
and one half minutes.

01:30:36.616 --> 01:30:38.200
Good.

01:30:38.326 --> 01:30:41.913
Well, I was gonna break one of
your golden rules this weekend

01:30:42.038 --> 01:30:44.415
by mixing
business with pleasure.

01:30:44.498 --> 01:30:47.418
I was going to ask you
about expanding my syndication

01:30:47.501 --> 01:30:49.211
with a more prominent by-line.

01:30:49.337 --> 01:30:52.423
Why didn't you say something?
I'm sure we can arrange...

01:30:52.506 --> 01:30:55.801
I was going to say something
but then I started thinking,

01:30:55.927 --> 01:30:58.930
and the only way I can have
a real effect on the readers

01:30:59.013 --> 01:31:00.806
and the community that
I'm covering,

01:31:00.932 --> 01:31:03.433
is if I have time.

01:31:03.434 --> 01:31:04.727
Lots of time,

01:31:04.810 --> 01:31:06.437
WR.

01:31:07.104 --> 01:31:09.607
I agree with you, 1 00%.

01:31:09.732 --> 01:31:13.110
I'll have the office draw up...
an eight-year contract.

01:31:13.236 --> 01:31:14.528
Eight years?

01:31:14.612 --> 01:31:16.613
WR, now really.

01:31:16.614 --> 01:31:19.699
Eight years won't do
either of us any good.

01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:22.535
We're at the point
in our careers

01:31:22.536 --> 01:31:24.621
where we need security.

01:31:24.622 --> 01:31:26.707
Security?

01:31:26.832 --> 01:31:29.210
Security from whom?

01:31:30.336 --> 01:31:32.213
The wrong people.

01:31:33.297 --> 01:31:35.258
There are wrong people,
you know.

01:31:37.385 --> 01:31:39.095
I know.

01:31:39.178 --> 01:31:42.974
I'm willing to devote my life
to Hearst newspapers.

01:31:43.099 --> 01:31:45.684
But I need to know
here and now

01:31:45.685 --> 01:31:48.688
that you're willing
to grant me the life I want.

01:31:49.897 --> 01:31:51.982
You give me my security...

01:31:51.983 --> 01:31:54.360
and I'll give you yours, WR.

01:31:57.071 --> 01:31:59.198
For a lifetime.

01:32:02.368 --> 01:32:04.996
Lifetime contract...

01:32:08.499 --> 01:32:10.792
Is that a question

01:32:10.793 --> 01:32:13.796
or an answer, WR?

01:32:23.973 --> 01:32:26.475
I swear I heard a shot.

01:32:26.559 --> 01:32:29.562
Some people
will say anything to get attention.

01:32:29.687 --> 01:32:31.062
I did!

01:32:31.063 --> 01:32:33.482
I heard noises all night.
But not a gunshot.

01:32:33.566 --> 01:32:37.486
The only shot Didi was close to
had whiskey in it.

01:32:39.196 --> 01:32:41.198
Be quiet,
I know what I heard.

01:32:41.282 --> 01:32:43.993
I heard noises too.
Have you seen Tom?

01:32:44.076 --> 01:32:45.368
No.

01:32:45.369 --> 01:32:47.371
Why have we stopped?
Where are we?

01:32:47.496 --> 01:32:49.080
We're in San Diego, sir.

01:32:49.081 --> 01:32:52.168
But I don't know the plan.
We weren't scheduled to stop here.

01:32:52.293 --> 01:32:53.961
I'm aware of that.

01:32:54.086 --> 01:32:55.796
Perhaps he's
taken up shooting fish.

01:33:06.974 --> 01:33:09.185
It's just me.

01:33:09.268 --> 01:33:11.187
- I love you.
- Is he all right?

01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:14.481
He's gonna be fine.
Everything is.

01:33:14.482 --> 01:33:16.484
Now you go back to sleep.

01:33:24.575 --> 01:33:26.160
Kono.

01:33:26.285 --> 01:33:28.162
What brings you to San Diego?

01:33:28.287 --> 01:33:30.289
They told me change in plans.

01:33:30.373 --> 01:33:32.375
- Who told you?
- Mr. Hearst's office.

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:35.378
- Has anybody left yet?
- Just the doctor and the injured man.

01:33:35.461 --> 01:33:38.171
- Injured?
- There were bandages on his head.

01:33:38.172 --> 01:33:39.882
- There was blood.
- What man?

01:33:39.966 --> 01:33:42.593
I don't know. For a minute
I thought he was you.

01:33:42.677 --> 01:33:46.097
- Was he conscious?
- Not to my eyes.

01:33:54.188 --> 01:33:56.482
Goddamn Jap!

01:33:58.276 --> 01:34:00.486
...Or WR shot an albatross
for our breakfast!

01:34:00.570 --> 01:34:02.780
You know it's bad luck
to shoot an albatross.

01:34:02.863 --> 01:34:05.366
- Good morning, Charlie.
- Good morning.

01:34:05.491 --> 01:34:08.369
Good morning.
- Unfortunately, I have bad news.

01:34:08.494 --> 01:34:11.080
Tom Ince took ill last night
and decided to leave early.

01:34:11.163 --> 01:34:14.584
- What was wrong with him?
- He said his ulcers were acting up.

01:34:14.667 --> 01:34:17.169
- Why didn't anyone call me?
- Hell, we wanted to,

01:34:17.295 --> 01:34:19.588
but Tom said
not to bother you.

01:34:19.589 --> 01:34:21.966
He's fine.
Dr. Goodman is taking him home.

01:34:22.091 --> 01:34:23.676
Where's Marion and Lolly?

01:34:23.759 --> 01:34:26.887
Ah... they looked after Tom
during his difficulties.

01:34:26.888 --> 01:34:28.890
You know,
Lolly has an ulcer herself.

01:34:28.973 --> 01:34:31.767
They were up half the night.
They're both still resting.

01:34:34.395 --> 01:34:35.896
Which...

01:34:35.897 --> 01:34:37.398
given the delay,

01:34:37.481 --> 01:34:40.358
means that we have to cut
our journey short here in San Diego.

01:34:40.359 --> 01:34:42.570
- You're kidding.
Oh, no.

01:34:42.695 --> 01:34:45.071
Don't worry,
I've already got cars for everyone.

01:34:45.072 --> 01:34:47.699
We must go up
and visit the birthday boy.

01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:49.285
That's a splendid idea.

01:34:50.369 --> 01:34:54.081
However, there is one thing
I want to ask you,

01:34:54.165 --> 01:34:56.959
and I can't say this
with enough seriousness.

01:34:59.879 --> 01:35:03.090
To our eyes,
Tom Ince left this boat

01:35:03.174 --> 01:35:05.675
with a bout of angry ulcers.

01:35:05.676 --> 01:35:09.180
But I can't begin to imagine
what the press is going to make up.

01:35:09.263 --> 01:35:12.975
Wild birthday party,
illegal alcohol, orgies...

01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:16.979
Reputations are...
so fragile.

01:35:17.063 --> 01:35:18.980
Just terrible.

01:35:18.981 --> 01:35:21.400
They'll link
Tom's innocent ulcers

01:35:21.484 --> 01:35:24.695
to every secret
everyone of us ever kept.

01:35:24.779 --> 01:35:26.364
And drag us all down.

01:35:27.782 --> 01:35:28.991
So,

01:35:29.075 --> 01:35:31.785
I'm asking you to join me

01:35:31.786 --> 01:35:33.287
in uh...

01:35:33.371 --> 01:35:34.872
in an oath of silence.

01:35:34.997 --> 01:35:36.791
Just a little one.

01:35:36.874 --> 01:35:39.669
You were asleep,
you left early,

01:35:39.794 --> 01:35:41.671
any excuse you like.

01:35:41.796 --> 01:35:43.464
But you do not know

01:35:43.589 --> 01:35:46.092
what happened to Tom Ince
aboard this boat.

01:35:48.761 --> 01:35:50.972
I would love
to take an oath... any oath.

01:35:51.097 --> 01:35:53.599
Me too!
Let's make it in blood.

01:35:55.268 --> 01:35:57.895
Rather dramatic, WR,
but I'll take an oath to that.

01:35:57.979 --> 01:36:00.398
Of course, why not?
Good. Thank you all.

01:36:06.195 --> 01:36:07.863
Marion?

01:36:13.661 --> 01:36:15.288
Oh, Charlie...

01:36:16.664 --> 01:36:18.791
Are you all right?

01:36:20.293 --> 01:36:22.670
What the hell
is going on here?

01:36:24.463 --> 01:36:27.591
I'm sure I speak for Tom when I say
thank you all for coming

01:36:27.592 --> 01:36:30.261
and making his birthday
such a memorable event.

01:36:30.386 --> 01:36:33.890
Why don't we all pack
and meet on deck in an hour?

01:36:33.973 --> 01:36:35.975
WR!

01:36:37.101 --> 01:36:39.979
Did all this happen
before or after I saw you?

01:36:40.062 --> 01:36:41.980
Saw me? When?

01:36:41.981 --> 01:36:43.983
Last night, in the corridor.

01:36:44.066 --> 01:36:45.902
You didn't see me, Tom.

01:36:45.985 --> 01:36:47.695
It's George, and...

01:36:47.778 --> 01:36:50.990
All you have to do is get
in that limousine and go home.

01:36:55.077 --> 01:36:57.163
But he doesn't
even look like me!

01:36:57.288 --> 01:37:00.499
He... he... put on your hat,
it was dark...

01:37:01.584 --> 01:37:02.793
Willie...

01:37:03.961 --> 01:37:05.963
Jesus!

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:12.595
Excuse me, Mr. Hearst.
Are you sure Tom's all right?

01:37:12.678 --> 01:37:14.388
He's just fine.

01:37:14.472 --> 01:37:17.098
Everybody is talking about noises...

01:37:17.099 --> 01:37:19.185
sounds, gunshots...

01:37:19.268 --> 01:37:22.562
I haven't had the chance to tell you
you're quite a fine actress.

01:37:22.563 --> 01:37:24.565
Thank you, but if Tom
wasn't feeling well...

01:37:24.690 --> 01:37:28.193
Please, don't worry,
he's getting the best of care.

01:37:28.194 --> 01:37:31.280
We need to meet at the studio.
God, you're good!

01:37:31.364 --> 01:37:34.367
I saw that picture that you did
and you played the... uh...

01:37:34.492 --> 01:37:36.869
the lovely young woman,
what was it called?

01:37:36.994 --> 01:37:39.872
Oh, I can't remember the title,
but you were splendid.

01:37:39.997 --> 01:37:43.000
What about next week?
Friday? How's that?

01:37:43.084 --> 01:37:46.295
Oh...
Friday. Uhm...

01:37:46.379 --> 01:37:48.297
I... I want you to know

01:37:48.381 --> 01:37:50.799
that Tom spoke
very lovingly about you

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.385
and he wanted you
to know that

01:37:52.468 --> 01:37:54.761
he's very sorry
about what happened.

01:37:54.762 --> 01:37:58.182
Why wasn't I awakened?
Didn't he want me to accompany him?

01:37:58.266 --> 01:38:00.101
Accompany him?

01:38:00.184 --> 01:38:02.562
Child, you're his mistress.

01:38:02.687 --> 01:38:04.980
You can't accompany him home

01:38:04.981 --> 01:38:07.191
to greet his wife and children.

01:38:08.401 --> 01:38:10.194
I'll see you Friday.

01:38:17.702 --> 01:38:20.788
What are you waiting for?
Let's get off this bloody boat!

01:38:26.294 --> 01:38:29.297
- You have things to do.
- I just bet he does.

01:38:37.179 --> 01:38:39.599
Okay, WR, here I am.

01:38:39.682 --> 01:38:41.767
Easier to hit than a seagull.

01:38:48.566 --> 01:38:49.984
You left this in his room.

01:38:59.368 --> 01:39:01.787
There's something
for your scrapbook, Charlie.

01:39:07.668 --> 01:39:10.588
I sure as hell didn't get
Tom Ince's blood on it!

01:39:10.671 --> 01:39:12.798
You two are the reason
for that blood!

01:39:12.882 --> 01:39:15.593
Haven't you
any sense of responsibility?

01:39:15.676 --> 01:39:18.262
Did I pull the trigger
or shoot him in the head?!

01:39:18.387 --> 01:39:21.181
That version of events
can be arranged, Charlie.

01:39:21.182 --> 01:39:24.602
I can produce three witnesses
on this boat alone.

01:39:24.685 --> 01:39:27.063
You see?
It's better for everyone

01:39:27.188 --> 01:39:29.565
if Tom Ince
had an ulcerous attack.

01:39:29.690 --> 01:39:31.400
And you, Marion?
Better for you?

01:39:31.484 --> 01:39:33.485
Only Marion
knows what's best for her.

01:39:33.486 --> 01:39:35.779
As long as it agrees
with her master's voice.

01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:37.281
No.

01:39:37.365 --> 01:39:39.992
All I want
is to see Marion happy.

01:39:41.202 --> 01:39:44.580
That's what I devoted my life to
for the past seven years.

01:39:44.664 --> 01:39:46.582
And all the years
I've got left.

01:39:47.792 --> 01:39:49.794
Can you promise that, Charlie?

01:39:51.003 --> 01:39:52.963
If he can, Marion,

01:39:52.964 --> 01:39:54.882
and if you can believe him...

01:39:56.467 --> 01:39:58.802
then go.

01:39:58.803 --> 01:40:00.888
Go.

01:40:04.183 --> 01:40:06.269
Good luck to both of you.

01:40:15.069 --> 01:40:16.862
Come on.

01:40:18.573 --> 01:40:20.783
For how long?

01:40:20.866 --> 01:40:23.869
For now, forever,
for as long as you want!

01:40:23.995 --> 01:40:26.371
For as long as you want.

01:40:26.372 --> 01:40:28.082
You're not telling me
that this...

01:40:28.165 --> 01:40:32.086
attempted murder has
rekindled your love for Willie?

01:40:35.298 --> 01:40:37.675
Just leave, Charlie.

01:40:42.179 --> 01:40:44.974
Leave with me.

01:40:53.482 --> 01:40:55.693
I love you.

01:41:05.995 --> 01:41:07.787
Old goat's really got you,
hasn't he?

01:41:07.788 --> 01:41:09.790
No...

01:41:09.874 --> 01:41:11.792
I've got me.

01:42:59.483 --> 01:43:01.277
I am not here.

01:43:01.402 --> 01:43:02.695
Ma'am?

01:43:03.779 --> 01:43:07.282
Like others with
tiny bullets hiding in their skulls,

01:43:07.283 --> 01:43:09.994
Thomas Ince held on
unconscious for two days

01:43:10.077 --> 01:43:13.080
before dying in his own bed.

01:43:13.164 --> 01:43:16.375
There was plenty of misinformation
in the days following his death,

01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:19.295
much of it coming straight
from the Hearst press machine,

01:43:19.378 --> 01:43:23.673
which inexplicably reported
that Ince was "stricken unconscious"

01:43:23.674 --> 01:43:26.885
while visiting Hearst
at his upstate ranch!

01:43:26.886 --> 01:43:29.680
Three weeks later,
the San Diego District Attorney

01:43:29.764 --> 01:43:33.601
conducted an obligatory
investigation and was,

01:43:33.684 --> 01:43:36.895
"satisfied that the death
of Thomas H. Ince

01:43:36.896 --> 01:43:40.982
was caused by heart failure
as a result of acute indigestion."

01:43:40.983 --> 01:43:45.279
He did not examine the body because
Ince had been cremated immediately,

01:43:45.404 --> 01:43:47.073
and except for Dr. Goodman,

01:43:47.198 --> 01:43:49.491
no member of the boating party
was ever questioned,

01:43:49.492 --> 01:43:51.702
including Hearst.

01:43:51.786 --> 01:43:53.871
The San Diego DA suggested

01:43:53.996 --> 01:43:56.998
that the Los Angeles office
continue the investigation.

01:43:56.999 --> 01:43:59.377
They politely declined.

01:44:08.094 --> 01:44:09.804
Marion.

01:44:23.401 --> 01:44:24.694
Hello.

01:44:24.777 --> 01:44:26.487
Charlie, what are you doing,
you dope?

01:44:26.571 --> 01:44:28.197
Don't you have a ride?

01:44:29.282 --> 01:44:31.492
I just...

01:44:31.576 --> 01:44:33.286
I wanted to see you.

01:44:33.369 --> 01:44:35.079
Here I am.

01:44:42.503 --> 01:44:44.505
He's...

01:44:45.965 --> 01:44:48.175
dead, Charlie.

01:44:49.594 --> 01:44:51.095
I know.

01:44:51.178 --> 01:44:53.389
I know.

01:44:56.392 --> 01:44:58.978
I move to Mexico
in a couple of days.

01:44:59.979 --> 01:45:01.188
Mexico?

01:45:02.481 --> 01:45:04.984
Another try
at the old marriage game.

01:45:05.985 --> 01:45:07.403
How bad can it be?

01:45:10.781 --> 01:45:13.700
Come on, Charlie.

01:45:13.701 --> 01:45:15.494
Get in.

01:45:20.374 --> 01:45:21.792
And go where?

01:45:24.879 --> 01:45:26.797
I've got arrangements to make,

01:45:26.881 --> 01:45:30.092
avoiding the press
and that kind of fun stuff.

01:45:33.387 --> 01:45:35.890
Come on, I'm not as pathetic
as all that, am I?

01:45:46.192 --> 01:45:48.194
Goodbye, Charlie.

01:45:53.991 --> 01:45:56.077
I'll send you a postcard.

01:45:56.202 --> 01:45:58.704
"Love and Kisses
from me and the missus."

01:46:26.482 --> 01:46:28.066
To this day,

01:46:28.067 --> 01:46:30.903
no two accounts of that
weekend cruise are the same,

01:46:30.987 --> 01:46:33.489
including who, in fact,
was on the boat.

01:46:33.573 --> 01:46:37.702
There are no logs, you see,
no records or photographs of any kind.

01:46:37.785 --> 01:46:41.581
And not a single person involved
wrote or spoke about that weekend...

01:46:41.706 --> 01:46:45.376
that is... until significantly
after the old man's death,

01:46:45.501 --> 01:46:47.378
and even then only in riddles.

01:46:48.796 --> 01:46:51.881
Soon after Tom's death,
Margaret Livingston's salary

01:46:51.882 --> 01:46:56.386
inexplicably jumped from $300
to $1,000 dollars a week.

01:46:56.387 --> 01:47:00.391
Eventually, she retired to manage
her husband, Paul Whiteman,

01:47:00.474 --> 01:47:02.977
the bandleader who popularized
the Charleston.

01:47:04.186 --> 01:47:06.606
Lolly got her lifetime contract,

01:47:06.689 --> 01:47:08.691
and for the next 30 years,

01:47:08.774 --> 01:47:13.486
became the most powerful and feared
gossip columnist in America.

01:47:13.487 --> 01:47:17.991
Three days after Tom's funeral,
Charlie married Lita Grey in Mexico.

01:47:17.992 --> 01:47:19.994
It lasted two years.

01:47:20.077 --> 01:47:23.079
He did, however,
recast her role in "The Gold Rush,"

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.166
and re-shoot all her scenes.

01:47:25.291 --> 01:47:30.004
Despite costing a small fortune,
the picture was a smashing success.

01:47:31.172 --> 01:47:35.801
It took three more years for WR
to let Marion do a full-fledged comedy.

01:47:35.885 --> 01:47:38.596
As Charlie predicted,
she triumphed.

01:47:38.679 --> 01:47:42.600
She retired in 193 7,
but stayed by Hearst's side

01:47:42.683 --> 01:47:44.977
until his death
at the age of 88.

01:47:47.688 --> 01:47:50.191
I've had
a recurring dream recently...

01:47:51.484 --> 01:47:53.486
I'm back on the Oneida,

01:47:53.569 --> 01:47:56.280
having a glorious time.

01:48:21.305 --> 01:48:24.766
But I'm watching how ridiculous
everyone else looks

01:48:24.767 --> 01:48:27.603
and I wonder why
they don't realize it.

01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:32.483
Then I see that, in fact,
I too look like a fool.

01:48:33.776 --> 01:48:35.193
Yet, it's so much fun...

01:48:35.194 --> 01:48:37.280
that none of us can stop.

01:48:38.906 --> 01:48:40.491
If we stopped...

01:48:41.576 --> 01:48:43.869
we'd have nothing.

01:48:46.789 --> 01:48:49.208
Come on, everybody!
