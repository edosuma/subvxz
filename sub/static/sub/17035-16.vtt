WEBVTT

00:05.003 --> 00:08.937
Travel... a rare opportunity 
to visit other cultures

00:09.030 --> 00:10.263
and see how they live.

00:10.365 --> 00:14.200
We're here. Welcome to Casa Heck.

00:14.302 --> 00:15.763
It's so cute!

00:15.865 --> 00:17.370
Well, a few other words come to mind,

00:17.472 --> 00:19.038
but I'll take "cute" any day.

00:19.140 --> 00:21.332
We're so happy to have you here
for spring break, Lexie.

00:21.434 --> 00:22.735
Thanks, Mrs. Heck.

00:22.804 --> 00:25.578
Oh, my God. I love how the
kitchen is right near the entry.

00:25.680 --> 00:26.779
It's so convenient.

00:26.881 --> 00:28.973
At our house, the kitchen
is so far away.

00:29.075 --> 00:30.042
It's a hike.

00:30.067 --> 00:31.851
To get there, you have
to go through two hallways,

00:31.953 --> 00:33.453
the family room, and the great room.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.021
Well, you don't have
to worry about that here.

00:35.123 --> 00:36.689
None of the rooms are great.

00:36.791 --> 00:39.050
Well, I love it. It's just so homey.

00:39.152 --> 00:40.928
And as a thank-you for letting me stay

00:41.030 --> 00:42.754
in your super-cute home, I got you this.

00:42.856 --> 00:44.389
Oh, look at this bag.

00:44.491 --> 00:45.957
Is this the gift? Can I keep this?

00:49.996 --> 00:52.463
Holy crap. This is beautiful.

00:52.565 --> 00:54.065
It's for your fine candies.

00:54.167 --> 00:56.734
Oh. Well, around here,
the candy usually goes

00:56.836 --> 00:58.870
right from the bag to my mouth.

00:58.972 --> 01:01.539
Hey, Brick, go find a place
for this where it'll look nice.

01:02.299 --> 01:03.583
The Donahues'?

01:03.685 --> 01:06.252
Come on, Lexie. I'll give you the tour.

01:06.354 --> 01:08.546
I think it looked best in the bag.

01:08.648 --> 01:09.878
Yeah.

01:11.151 --> 01:13.184
All right, bottom of the ninth here.

01:13.286 --> 01:16.521
Orson Limestone's up by one,
but Royal Flushes have two on,

01:16.623 --> 01:19.094
and Big Henry coming to the plate.

01:27.500 --> 01:31.436
And the Royal Flushes score.
They win the game.

01:31.538 --> 01:34.572
Final score... Royal Flushes 5,
Orson Limestone...

01:34.674 --> 01:37.475
Well, at least we had fun.

01:37.577 --> 01:40.078
I'll get the orange slices.

01:40.180 --> 01:41.579
I'm not having fun.

01:41.681 --> 01:44.849
In fact, this is my fifth game
in a row not having fun.

01:44.951 --> 01:46.617
Yeah. I mean, I know we have to have

01:46.720 --> 01:48.252
two female employees on the team,

01:48.355 --> 01:50.655
but do they got to be
the two oldest women on Earth?

01:50.757 --> 01:52.023
How come we don't have any younger women

01:52.125 --> 01:53.291
working at the quarry?

01:53.393 --> 01:55.593
Age is just a number, fellas.

01:55.695 --> 01:58.404
All women are goddesses
in the eyes of the Chuck.

01:58.506 --> 02:00.740
As long as that number stays
above 18, I'm with you.

02:00.842 --> 02:03.042
Why did you play Eleanor
at second base?!

02:03.144 --> 02:04.544
You know she got a bad hip!

02:04.646 --> 02:06.279
Hey, we can't turn on each other.

02:06.381 --> 02:09.148
The Royal Flushes obviously
stacked their team with ringers.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.750
Either that, or that's
the most athletically gifted

02:10.852 --> 02:12.719
group of plumbers I've ever seen.

02:12.821 --> 02:15.822
Ooh, orange slices. Thank you, Eleanor.

02:15.924 --> 02:17.657
We are truly blessed.

02:21.396 --> 02:24.564
Frankie, hi.
How exciting is all this, huh?

02:24.666 --> 02:26.966
You must be so proud.

02:27.068 --> 02:28.534
Uh, yeah, I am.

02:28.636 --> 02:31.137
I mean, it's just so special.

02:31.239 --> 02:33.072
Are you just tickled to the core?

02:33.174 --> 02:35.108
So tickled.

02:35.210 --> 02:37.944
Well, congrats again, proud lady.

02:43.585 --> 02:46.519
Hey, do we have anything to be proud of?

02:46.588 --> 02:48.354
No, not that I can think of.

02:48.389 --> 02:50.757
That's what I thought,
but Nancy Donahue drove up

02:50.825 --> 02:53.351
while I was getting the mail
and kept going on and on

02:53.420 --> 02:54.879
about how proud I should be,

02:54.948 --> 02:57.059
and I had no idea
what she was talking about.

02:57.128 --> 02:58.750
Why didn't you just ask her?

02:58.965 --> 02:59.899
I couldn't.

02:59.967 --> 03:01.365
I had already told her I was so proud.

03:01.467 --> 03:03.679
I couldn't go back on it after
I'd already agreed with her.

03:03.781 --> 03:04.935
I'd look stupid.

03:05.037 --> 03:06.704
You know, historically, looking stupid

03:06.772 --> 03:08.439
hasn't always been a deterrent for you.

03:09.742 --> 03:12.592
The nerve of her,
asking me if I'm proud.

03:12.661 --> 03:14.902
She knows darn well we don't
have anything to be proud of.

03:14.971 --> 03:16.438
That's it.

03:16.507 --> 03:18.215
She's proud-baiting me.

03:18.284 --> 03:20.106
She's got something she's proud of

03:20.174 --> 03:22.078
and she's just trying
to get me to ask her about it.

03:22.822 --> 03:24.113
I've helped as much as I can here.

03:27.293 --> 03:29.913
Uh, I think something
happened to my hair.

03:30.318 --> 03:32.182
Oh, no. I should've told you.

03:32.251 --> 03:33.746
We're still using the dog shampoo

03:33.814 --> 03:35.306
my mom accidentally bought in bulk.

03:35.374 --> 03:36.612
You can't use the regular amount...

03:36.681 --> 03:37.786
it's in dog measurements.

03:37.855 --> 03:40.390
It's okay. I-I'm sure it'll relax.

03:40.870 --> 03:42.437
Hey, is that a hole in the wall?

03:42.505 --> 03:43.571
It's so cute.

03:43.673 --> 03:44.772
Yeah. It's a long story.

03:44.841 --> 03:46.610
That goes to Axl and Brick's room.

03:46.679 --> 03:48.443
Oh, that... that's Axl's room?

03:48.511 --> 03:50.411
Is he coming home for spring break?

03:50.447 --> 03:52.678
Yeah, but don't worry.
I'll cover the hole.

03:52.747 --> 03:55.420
You won't smell the farting, but
you'll probably still hear it...

03:55.522 --> 03:56.593
and smell it.

03:57.477 --> 03:59.935
So, uh, is he still dating April?

04:00.004 --> 04:01.503
Ugh. I don't know
what's going on with them.

04:01.572 --> 04:03.472
They got married, then divorced,
now they're dating.

04:03.507 --> 04:04.439
It's weird.

04:04.508 --> 04:07.207
Huh. So, are they, like, exclusive?

04:08.262 --> 04:10.233
God, Lexie, you sound like
my friends in high school

04:10.335 --> 04:11.980
who used to like...

04:12.049 --> 04:13.148
- Don't make me say it.
- Don't say it.

04:13.217 --> 04:14.483
- I don't want to say it.
- Don't say it.

04:14.552 --> 04:16.317
- I like Axl.
- No, you said it!

04:17.706 --> 04:18.870
Wait.

04:18.939 --> 04:20.594
Did you just start feeling this way?

04:20.675 --> 04:22.408
'Cause that shampoo isn't FDA-approved.

04:22.543 --> 04:24.043
The chemicals could've seeped
into your brain.

04:24.111 --> 04:25.377
No, I've known for a while.

04:25.446 --> 04:27.813
I thought I would get over it,
you know, like... like the flu.

04:27.882 --> 04:29.882
Oh, I was wondering why
you'd ever want to come to Orson

04:29.950 --> 04:32.078
for spring break instead of the Bahamas.

04:32.180 --> 04:33.185
I'm sorry.

04:33.220 --> 04:35.854
It's just, he's kind of cute
and funny and I-I can't help it.

04:35.923 --> 04:37.952
Okay, okay. Okay.

04:40.139 --> 04:41.972
Oh my God. I think I have
hysterical blindness.

04:42.110 --> 04:43.176
Your eyes are closed.

04:44.212 --> 04:47.380
Okay. I'm not blind,
but I am still very hysterical.

04:47.482 --> 04:50.124
I mean, this is a lot
of information to process.

04:50.226 --> 04:52.360
It's a clash of things...
of two things I like,

04:52.429 --> 04:54.195
but I'm not sure I like them together.

04:54.264 --> 04:56.723
Like turkey and chocolate...
I like them, but not as a couple.

04:56.791 --> 04:59.091
But who knows?
Maybe they would be delicious.

04:59.193 --> 05:01.170
And I mean, who am I
to stop turkey and chocolate

05:01.195 --> 05:02.895
from getting together if they want to?

05:02.972 --> 05:03.871
Just go for it!

05:03.973 --> 05:06.332
Oh! Thank you so much.

05:06.367 --> 05:08.734
I would never do anythg
about it without your blessing.

05:08.803 --> 05:10.136
Now, where can I put this towel

05:10.204 --> 05:11.670
so your cleaning lady will find it?

05:18.413 --> 05:20.246
Hi. You're home.

05:20.314 --> 05:21.881
Lexie.

05:22.672 --> 05:23.805
New look for you?

05:23.907 --> 05:24.839
Oh, this?

05:24.975 --> 05:26.508
I think it's just the water.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.810
Hmm. What are you doing here?

05:28.879 --> 05:30.779
Oh, I'm spring-breaking
in Orson with Sue.

05:30.881 --> 05:32.213
Wow.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.382
I don't know what series
of catastrophes befell the world

05:34.451 --> 05:36.451
for you to end up here, but I am sorry.

05:36.486 --> 05:39.043
I'm not following you with my eyes.

05:39.390 --> 05:40.790
What?

05:40.858 --> 05:42.491
You know how you used to say
that I would do that?

05:42.560 --> 05:43.525
Well, I'm not doing that.

05:43.550 --> 05:46.329
I'm just saying that
'cause it's, like, our thing.

05:46.431 --> 05:47.696
Okay.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.865
Hey, remember that time
when we were in the Bin

05:49.934 --> 05:51.867
and you threw the ball
and I was like, "What?"

05:52.744 --> 05:54.904
Uh... yeah.

05:55.289 --> 05:56.606
Whatever.

05:56.641 --> 05:59.775
I got to go scrape poop
off a cow statue, so see ya.

06:07.719 --> 06:08.918
Haley, pick up line 2.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.587
Haley, pick up on line 2.

06:12.112 --> 06:13.612
Oh, I'm under obligation to ask

06:13.680 --> 06:15.480
if you're eating this chicken tonight.

06:15.582 --> 06:16.481
Yeah.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.440
Okay, then I can sell it to you.

06:19.853 --> 06:22.054
Hey, didn't you used to coach
my kids at the high school?

06:22.122 --> 06:24.284
Not used to... still do.

06:24.471 --> 06:25.570
Tink Babbitt.

06:25.639 --> 06:28.039
Got to work two jobs just to break even,

06:28.108 --> 06:30.008
but my reward comes
when the kids come back

06:30.110 --> 06:32.777
and tell me I've impacted their lives.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.578
Still waiting on that last one.

06:35.694 --> 06:38.216
Oh, man. The dent's right
on the barcode.

06:38.285 --> 06:40.218
Todd, I'm gonna need a price check here!

06:41.773 --> 06:44.714
So, are you a member of our
Frugal Hoosier Misers Club?

06:44.847 --> 06:47.404
Yep, almost at Tightwad status.

06:47.730 --> 06:49.330
Tink, 59 cents!

06:53.102 --> 06:55.936
Say, if you're looking for a second job,

06:56.005 --> 06:58.739
how'd you like to hang
around a quarry trailer,

06:58.841 --> 07:00.241
reading a magazine,

07:00.343 --> 07:02.943
and playing in the occasional
softball game?

07:03.338 --> 07:05.905
I'd say you got yourself a temp Tink.

07:06.007 --> 07:07.373
Great.

07:07.475 --> 07:08.841
And now that I don't work here anymore,

07:08.943 --> 07:10.242
you shouldn't eat that chicken.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.267
Hey, do you know anything
we have to be proud of?

07:20.336 --> 07:22.436
Other than the fanciest
dog dish in Orson.

07:22.505 --> 07:24.872
I got over 100% on my geometry test.

07:24.941 --> 07:27.174
No, it's got to be something
that Nancy would know about.

07:27.243 --> 07:28.175
Oh.

07:28.277 --> 07:30.048
Well, I did both start and cure myself

07:30.116 --> 07:31.691
of a new tic without you noticing.

07:31.793 --> 07:34.048
You mean the "ehh-ehh-ehh-pfft"?

07:34.366 --> 07:35.265
Yeah, I noticed.

07:35.367 --> 07:36.266
Mm.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.400
Well, that's all I can think of.

07:37.502 --> 07:38.501
Great.

07:38.570 --> 07:40.403
So, I'm proud
and I don't get to know why.

07:40.505 --> 07:42.338
Seems right.

07:42.407 --> 07:43.740
So, Mike's new vice president

07:43.809 --> 07:45.665
in charge of paper-towel acquisition

07:45.734 --> 07:49.112
was knocking it out
of the park... literally.

07:56.688 --> 07:57.620
Out!

07:57.722 --> 07:59.122
You're out!

08:01.788 --> 08:03.321
Time out! Come on!

08:03.423 --> 08:04.478
Hey.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.351
I don't know about this guy.
He's a big hitter.

08:06.454 --> 08:08.187
Well, he's a righty,
so why don't we shift

08:08.255 --> 08:10.389
the outfield left and get it covered?

08:10.458 --> 08:12.658
Beauty and brains.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.693
If you like Jet Skiing and Al Jarreau,

08:14.762 --> 08:16.595
we might be in this love together.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.664
Okay.

08:21.569 --> 08:24.069
And before you knew it,
Orson Limestone was up six runs

08:24.171 --> 08:26.905
under the sure hand of Coach Tink.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.874
Aah.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.576
Safe!

08:35.316 --> 08:36.347
Aah!

08:36.417 --> 08:38.884
All right, time out. Time out, ump.

08:41.114 --> 08:43.255
Heck, you're stinking it up out here.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.207
I'm gonna bring in a sub for you.

08:45.234 --> 08:47.134
John, get off the pine and get in here!

08:47.170 --> 08:49.069
I'm okay. I just tweaked my back
a little bit.

08:49.172 --> 08:50.404
Nothing half a beer can't cure.

08:50.473 --> 08:52.072
Ah, don't worry about it. Have a seat.

08:52.141 --> 08:54.775
Don't let Schmidt's Podiatry
get in your head, all right?

08:54.844 --> 08:56.710
Come on. Let's go.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:09.694 --> 09:11.096
Something to be proud of?

09:11.164 --> 09:13.683
Let's see... the miracle
that this evolved

09:13.697 --> 09:16.598
from the hillbilly water slide
that is you and Dad's DNA.

09:18.869 --> 09:19.935
Hey, Lexie.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.904
I hope you're enjoying your stay.

09:21.972 --> 09:24.273
Sue did give you
the good towel, didn't she?

09:24.341 --> 09:25.974
Uh, she gave me the Chewbacca one.

09:26.076 --> 09:27.609
Yeah, that's the one.

09:28.579 --> 09:29.478
Oh, hi.

09:29.547 --> 09:30.946
We keep running into each other.

09:31.015 --> 09:33.182
Well, there's like three rooms
in the whole house.

09:33.250 --> 09:34.650
Hey, so, I meant to ask you...

09:34.718 --> 09:37.052
what's a fun thing to do
on spring break in Orson?

09:37.121 --> 09:39.188
Besides leaving?

09:39.256 --> 09:42.224
Well, there's the beer-can
museum out on the state highway.

09:42.293 --> 09:43.325
Ooh, fun.

09:43.394 --> 09:45.427
Wow. I am so glad I came to Orson.

09:45.462 --> 09:47.796
I checked the weather, and it's
partly cloudy in the Bahamas.

09:47.865 --> 09:49.728
Dodged a bullet there.

09:49.797 --> 09:52.505
Mm. What else? There's um...

09:53.627 --> 09:54.626
You could go visit all my trophies

09:54.729 --> 09:55.661
in the trophy case
down at the high school.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.229
Spoiler alert... there are five.

09:57.298 --> 09:58.764
Mm.

09:58.833 --> 10:01.200
You okay? You look a little itchy.

10:01.302 --> 10:02.401
Oh, I'm fine.

10:02.470 --> 10:03.602
I'm totally interested
in what you're saying.

10:03.704 --> 10:04.603
You sure?

10:04.672 --> 10:06.345
You got something splotchy on your face.

10:07.208 --> 10:09.641
Oh, my God, Lexie. I am so sorry.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.744
I grabbed you the extra pillow
from the bottom of the closet.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.857
Doris must've been sleeping on it.

10:13.997 --> 10:15.162
Does she have fleas?

10:15.264 --> 10:16.097
Oh, no.

10:16.165 --> 10:17.465
I don't think so... not anymore.

10:17.533 --> 10:18.799
It's probably just our detergent.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.534
It's really cheap.
You have to get used to it.

10:20.603 --> 10:22.670
Or it could be the sheets.
What's the thread count?

10:22.772 --> 10:24.138
What's that?

10:24.207 --> 10:26.107
You know, the number of threads
woven together in the fabric.

10:26.175 --> 10:28.164
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

10:28.233 --> 10:29.950
What's better... higher or lower?

10:29.977 --> 10:31.176
Higher. Then they're lower.

10:37.584 --> 10:39.459
What? I saw Axl do this.

10:39.489 --> 10:40.353
It looked good.

10:40.456 --> 10:41.586
How was the game?

10:41.688 --> 10:42.821
We won.

10:42.890 --> 10:45.543
Oh. Well, that's great.

10:45.590 --> 10:47.323
So, Tink must be working out, huh?

10:47.425 --> 10:50.226
Yeah, she's good. Everybody loves her.

10:50.294 --> 10:52.194
So, why are you acting so weird?

10:52.263 --> 10:55.148
Oh, no. Was Chuck in charge
of refreshments again?

10:55.196 --> 10:56.462
No, I hurt my back,

10:56.531 --> 10:58.664
and so I blew a couple plays
I normally make,

10:58.766 --> 11:00.332
and Tink benched me.

11:00.401 --> 11:02.902
Oh, you know, I got
my car washed, finally.

11:02.970 --> 11:04.904
Maybe that's what Nancy thinks
I should be proud of?

11:05.006 --> 11:07.173
The sun was in my eyes for
the first three innings, so...

11:08.843 --> 11:10.709
Ugh, school. Let it ring.

11:12.246 --> 11:14.647
Hello, proud parents.
This is Jan in the main office.

11:14.749 --> 11:16.115
You haven't RSVP'd yet

11:16.150 --> 11:18.395
for the National Honor Society
induction ceremony,

11:18.464 --> 11:19.618
and we're trying to get a head count

11:19.687 --> 11:22.054
so we can see how many
pizza pockets we'll need.

11:22.123 --> 11:23.289
Congrats to Brick!

11:25.026 --> 11:28.694
Oh, I am so proud!

11:31.666 --> 11:33.478
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:33.505 --> 11:35.238
I-I didn't know where this led.

11:35.306 --> 11:38.274
Oh, you know, I went by your
school to see your tow-phies.

11:38.376 --> 11:40.376
What? Your tow-phies.

11:40.478 --> 11:41.711
I can't understand what you're saying.

11:41.813 --> 11:42.912
Plus, I'm a little distracted.

11:43.014 --> 11:44.380
You got a little bat in the cave, there.

11:44.482 --> 11:47.617
Oh, sorry. I'm just a little stuffed up.

11:47.685 --> 11:50.286
Anyway, uh, the week's almost over

11:50.388 --> 11:53.156
and I feel like
we haven't gotten a chance to...

11:55.126 --> 11:56.359
Well, the bat's gone.

11:56.427 --> 11:58.494
Now I'm just wondering where it went.

12:06.604 --> 12:08.304
Brick, hello?

12:08.406 --> 12:11.107
I ask you if we have anything
to be proud of,

12:11.180 --> 12:14.381
and you're talking to me about
acing some stupid geometry test?

12:14.483 --> 12:16.717
You made National Honor Society!

12:17.125 --> 12:19.119
Oh. Right.

12:19.188 --> 12:20.954
W-Why didn't you tell me?

12:21.715 --> 12:22.956
I don't know.

12:23.059 --> 12:24.525
I didn't think it was that big a deal.

12:24.593 --> 12:26.060
Plus, every time
there's an event at school,

12:26.128 --> 12:27.428
you and Dad roll your eyes.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.229
Then if you do come, you show up late.

12:29.298 --> 12:31.394
You always complain
about having to bring a dessert,

12:31.419 --> 12:33.686
even though we usually
just stop by on the way

12:33.788 --> 12:35.487
and grab some store-bought cookies.

12:35.556 --> 12:37.581
You sit on the end of the row, so
that way you can leave early, and...

12:37.606 --> 12:39.124
Okay, okay, okay. I get it.

12:39.226 --> 12:42.964
But, Brick, this is a big deal.

12:42.984 --> 12:44.116
You're the first person in the family

12:44.185 --> 12:45.751
to make the Honor Society.

12:45.820 --> 12:47.585
I mean, we don't have much
to be proud of,

12:47.610 --> 12:50.285
so when is time to be proud of,
I would like to be there.

12:50.655 --> 12:52.288
- When is it?
- Saturday.

12:52.390 --> 12:54.657
I can't go.

12:54.725 --> 12:57.393
Grandma got us tickets to the touring
company of "Finian's Rainbow"

12:57.461 --> 12:59.395
with the "Kiss my grits" girl
from "Alice",

12:59.463 --> 13:01.463
and she's really excited about it.

13:01.566 --> 13:02.531
Mom, it's all right.

13:02.633 --> 13:04.266
I really don't care if you go or not.

13:04.368 --> 13:05.367
Honestly.

13:05.469 --> 13:07.303
Besides, they videotape
these things now.

13:07.405 --> 13:10.172
I'm sorry. I really want to go,
but I can't blow off Grandma.

13:10.241 --> 13:13.142
Janet got her a massage recliner
for her birthday.

13:13.211 --> 13:15.077
Hey, go to the play.

13:15.179 --> 13:17.213
The ceremony's gonna be
pretty dull, actually.

13:17.315 --> 13:19.014
I just walk up and get a certificate.

13:19.116 --> 13:20.616
And I really want to see that,

13:20.718 --> 13:23.018
so make sure you get
a videotape of it, okay?

13:25.284 --> 13:27.117
You get that it's
about the massage recliner

13:27.219 --> 13:28.752
and me buying back my mom's love, right?

13:28.821 --> 13:29.853
Got it.

13:31.857 --> 13:33.257
With Tink at the helm,

13:33.325 --> 13:36.059
Orson Limestone won
their next four games.

13:36.162 --> 13:38.328
They even beat
Ernie's Injection Molding.

13:38.364 --> 13:40.230
Unfortunately, for those four games,

13:40.332 --> 13:42.332
Mike was playing a different position.

13:42.401 --> 13:44.568
Whoo! All right! Yeah!

13:44.670 --> 13:45.636
Ha ha!

13:45.738 --> 13:46.970
All right, Wayne, you're up.

13:47.039 --> 13:49.473
Chuck's on deck, and Dave's in the hole.

13:49.608 --> 13:51.542
I'm gonna bunt!

13:53.649 --> 13:55.883
Hey, Coach, I'm sitting out
a lot of games here.

13:55.985 --> 13:57.918
My back is feeling great now.
No kidding.

13:58.020 --> 14:00.154
I tied my shoes this morning
on the first try.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.589
I'm ready to get back in there.

14:01.691 --> 14:03.424
Oh, we're kind of
on a winning streak here, Heck.

14:03.526 --> 14:04.892
You don't want to mess with that mojo.

14:04.994 --> 14:06.994
Even talking about it
gives me the jeebies. Whoo!

14:09.432 --> 14:11.699
Well, I want to contribute, you know?

14:11.801 --> 14:13.601
And more than just knitting a bat cozy.

14:13.703 --> 14:15.970
Sorry, Heck, but John's playing
out of his mind.

14:16.072 --> 14:17.805
I kept thinking he was gonna
go back to his old ways,

14:17.907 --> 14:19.139
but he's on fire.

14:19.242 --> 14:21.575
Soon as he cools off,
you're the first one back in.

14:21.677 --> 14:24.879
When Dave was coach, he always
had me in the starting lineup.

14:24.981 --> 14:26.881
Dave, you okay with the lineup?

14:26.983 --> 14:28.749
You mean, am I okay with winning?

14:28.851 --> 14:29.884
Yeah.

14:31.220 --> 14:33.020
Stop moving.

14:40.385 --> 14:41.751
You're right... not bad.

14:41.820 --> 14:42.652
Mm-hmm.

14:42.754 --> 14:44.087
Okay, Lexie and I are all packed

14:44.189 --> 14:45.622
and we're heading back to school.

14:45.724 --> 14:48.514
I feel bad, though.
I think we Hecked up Lexie.

14:51.496 --> 14:53.571
Thank you again
for letting me stay here.

14:53.674 --> 14:57.133
It was a super-fun week...
five stars on Trip Advisor!

14:57.202 --> 14:59.795
Aww, well, it was great
having you, Lexie.

14:59.820 --> 15:00.950
Come anytime.

15:00.975 --> 15:04.456
Our house is your house... or
at least a much smaller version.

15:04.525 --> 15:06.325
Oh, is... is Axl around?

15:06.427 --> 15:08.193
I wanted to say goodbye.

15:08.295 --> 15:09.728
No, he left.

15:09.797 --> 15:12.931
He said Spring Break '17 will go
down as the most pathetic in history

15:13.033 --> 15:15.134
and he was ashamed to be a part of it.

15:15.202 --> 15:19.037
Um, my throat's closing up,
so I'd better go.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.040
Oh.

15:32.013 --> 15:33.146
Hey, Heck. How you doing?

15:33.248 --> 15:34.480
Hey.

15:34.549 --> 15:36.215
Feeling great, ready for
the game tomorrow.

15:36.284 --> 15:37.383
Yeah, I got some bad news,

15:37.485 --> 15:39.085
and I don't want you
to take it too hard,

15:39.154 --> 15:40.987
so I'm just gonna rip off the Band-Aid.

15:41.056 --> 15:42.522
I got poached. Poached?

15:42.591 --> 15:44.757
Yep. Hagen Westside Realty got me.

15:44.826 --> 15:46.926
All I got to do is push
their mail through a slot,

15:47.028 --> 15:48.541
pitch a couple of shutouts,

15:48.609 --> 15:50.683
and they're gonna fix the brakes
on my Subaru.

15:51.022 --> 15:52.921
Well, Eleanor's not gonna like it.

15:53.024 --> 15:54.523
We were about to start an afghan.

15:54.625 --> 15:56.992
But whatever's best for the team.

15:57.094 --> 16:00.229
All right, then. Later, champ.

16:05.770 --> 16:07.355
Hey, you look better.

16:07.457 --> 16:09.538
Yeah. Turns out
all I needed was a shower.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.167
Yeah. It's okay, Lex.
I'm sorry about that.

16:12.269 --> 16:13.275
We should've eased you in.

16:13.344 --> 16:15.477
You kind of have to build up
a tolerance to our house.

16:15.579 --> 16:16.712
So, where you headed?

16:16.814 --> 16:18.815
The Beta Tau Lambda
St. Patrick's Day party.

16:18.884 --> 16:19.748
You want to join me?

16:19.817 --> 16:21.750
Come on. It's the biggest party
of the year.

16:21.817 --> 16:23.083
Nah. I'm gonna ride around with Tyler

16:23.152 --> 16:24.184
in the Safe Ride cart later.

16:24.286 --> 16:25.619
It's his biggest night of the year, too.

16:25.721 --> 16:27.187
A lot of green beer going down,

16:27.256 --> 16:28.655
a lot of greener beer coming up.

16:29.239 --> 16:30.390
Sounds fun.

16:30.459 --> 16:31.907
Oh, don't worry.
I won't have to touch ***.

16:31.976 --> 16:33.360
You have to take a class.

16:35.130 --> 16:38.098
Congratulations.

16:38.167 --> 16:40.667
Our next student is Brick Heck.

16:45.381 --> 16:47.115
Mom, is that you?

16:47.217 --> 16:48.716
Uh, y-yeah.

16:48.818 --> 16:51.538
I thought I recognized
your annoying clap.

16:53.356 --> 16:54.689
What are you doing here?

16:54.791 --> 16:56.824
What happened to
"Finian's Rainbow" with Grandma?

16:56.893 --> 17:00.461
She got her friend Sparkle
to go with her.

17:01.561 --> 17:03.831
Hey, everybody, my mom and dad are here.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.260
They never usually come to stuff.

17:06.362 --> 17:09.704
W-We come to stuff. W-We both work.

17:15.021 --> 17:16.188
I'm just here for my dishes.

17:16.257 --> 17:18.226
I put them in earlier,
so they should be done by now.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.400
And don't worry.
I put yours in the sink.

17:20.441 --> 17:22.808
Axl, I am trying to study here.

17:22.910 --> 17:24.309
For what, obedience school?

17:24.411 --> 17:25.544
You know, you don't get a treat

17:25.612 --> 17:27.212
if you roll over
when you're supposed to sit.

17:27.314 --> 17:30.115
Oh, ha ha, 'cause I'm a dog.

17:30.184 --> 17:32.050
Hey, you're never gonna get
a treat with that attitude.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.186
So, uh, where's your owner?

17:34.288 --> 17:35.454
Who, Lexie?

17:35.556 --> 17:37.122
She's at that big
St. Patrick's Day party.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.457
I'm surprised you're not there.

17:38.525 --> 17:39.791
Nah, that party's lame.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.560
When you're a freshman and
sophomore, you think it's fun.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.061
As a junior, you only
go there ironically,

17:43.163 --> 17:45.464
and you would never be caught
dead there as a senior.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.834
Hey! Look at that.
Now this guy is clean.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.619
You want to put him to work, huh?

17:50.692 --> 17:51.658
What you got to eat around here?

17:51.760 --> 17:53.526
Come on. Make me something.

17:53.595 --> 17:55.829
I'm sorry to inform you, Axl,
but I'm not your maid.

17:55.897 --> 17:57.697
Oh, come on, girl! You can do it!

17:57.799 --> 17:59.032
Make me some din din!

17:59.100 --> 18:01.234
Oh, my God, Axl. You are such a jerk!

18:01.336 --> 18:04.304
I don't understand why Lexie
likes you so much.

18:04.372 --> 18:06.344
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:06.412 --> 18:08.208
Wait. Hold on. Are you serious?

18:08.310 --> 18:09.375
N-No.

18:09.444 --> 18:10.910
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:11.012 --> 18:12.512
I was not supposed to tell you that.

18:12.614 --> 18:13.780
Hmm.

18:13.849 --> 18:16.282
Well, I know I always joked
around about her liking me,

18:16.384 --> 18:17.283
but I never thought she really...

18:18.753 --> 18:20.797
Why do you think she came
to our house for spring break

18:20.822 --> 18:21.988
instead of the Bahamas?

18:22.057 --> 18:23.423
Who in their right mind would do that?

18:23.492 --> 18:24.724
She didn't even spend time with me.

18:24.826 --> 18:26.693
She just laughed
at all your stupid jokes

18:26.795 --> 18:28.628
and followed you around with her eyes.

18:28.730 --> 18:30.597
Well, her non-pus-y eye, at least.

18:30.699 --> 18:32.332
She knows I'm dating April, right?

18:32.434 --> 18:35.135
Yeah, I told her. I told her everything.

18:35.203 --> 18:37.604
I told her about how
you clip your toenails.

18:37.672 --> 18:39.472
I told her about your booger wall.

18:39.541 --> 18:43.009
I told her about Dr. Axl
and his fart-esthesia,

18:43.111 --> 18:44.811
and somehow, she still likes you.

18:44.913 --> 18:46.946
Well, good, good.

18:47.048 --> 18:48.047
I'm glad you told her those things,

18:48.116 --> 18:50.917
'cause, you know, it's not gonna happen.

18:51.019 --> 18:53.286
Hey! Look at that!

18:53.675 --> 18:54.799
Flip-flops came out great.

18:54.902 --> 18:55.688
Oh.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.395
There he is, Mr. National Honor Society.

19:02.497 --> 19:04.130
I can't believe you guys came.

19:04.232 --> 19:06.366
You made that very clear
over the microphone.

19:06.794 --> 19:08.995
Well, thank you for showing up.

19:09.063 --> 19:10.463
I-I'd better get over
to the dessert table.

19:10.565 --> 19:12.164
I grabbed some loose cookies
from your nightstand.

19:12.233 --> 19:13.659
They're in my backpack.

19:13.700 --> 19:16.301
Actually, Brick, I took care of that.

19:20.074 --> 19:21.574
Wow.

19:22.049 --> 19:23.911
Why would Nancy Donahue do a whole table

19:23.936 --> 19:24.901
dedicated just to me?

19:25.003 --> 19:27.003
Nancy didn't do it. I did it.

19:27.072 --> 19:28.271
How did you find a store
that had cupcakes

19:28.373 --> 19:29.840
with my name on them?

19:29.908 --> 19:30.974
These aren't from the store.

19:31.076 --> 19:32.876
I made them. I did it all this myself.

19:32.978 --> 19:35.679
I was up till 4:00 a.m. baking,
cutting out decorations,

19:35.781 --> 19:36.746
blowing up the balloons,

19:36.815 --> 19:39.082
making your favorite
lime-green JELL-O salad.

19:39.184 --> 19:41.685
Oh, my God. It isn't even Thanksgiving.

19:42.111 --> 19:43.677
Brick, I just want you to know,

19:43.779 --> 19:45.446
we could not be more proud of you.

19:45.548 --> 19:47.948
And this is proof,
'cause I hate doing this.

19:48.050 --> 19:50.551
I mean, it's easy to do things
you like for people,

19:50.619 --> 19:53.387
but doing something
you hate... that's love.

19:54.990 --> 19:57.124
Thanks, Mom. I love you, too.

19:57.972 --> 19:59.393
Frankie.

19:59.495 --> 20:00.861
Were parents supposed
to bring something?

20:00.963 --> 20:02.830
Did... Did I miss an e-mail or a flier?

20:02.932 --> 20:05.466
Oh, don't worry.
I brought enough for everybody.

20:05.568 --> 20:07.901
I mean, National Honor Society...

20:08.003 --> 20:09.736
how proud are we, right?

20:10.738 --> 20:13.106
Wow. Considering these
are filled with hate,

20:13.209 --> 20:14.441
- they're delicious.
- Yeah.

20:15.387 --> 20:17.578
Ron, did you throw away a flier?!

20:17.680 --> 20:18.779
Ron!

20:25.888 --> 20:27.621
Axl. What's up, Olson?

20:27.723 --> 20:28.719
What's up, man?

20:28.822 --> 20:30.624
I thought you said you'd have to
be dead to be seen at this party.

20:30.726 --> 20:31.792
Yeah, yeah.

20:31.894 --> 20:33.093
Well, can I, uh, catch up
with you guys later?

20:33.195 --> 20:35.028
I'm kind of looking for someone.

20:35.130 --> 20:36.763
That's her.

20:40.536 --> 20:41.502
Axl!

20:41.604 --> 20:43.136
Devin?

20:48.826 --> 20:49.958
Well, with Tink gone,

20:50.060 --> 20:51.967
Orson Limestone's hot streak was over.

20:52.101 --> 20:53.634
But at least Mike was back in the game.

20:53.736 --> 20:56.986
Unfortunately, their first game
was against...

20:57.073 --> 20:58.039
Bring it in!

20:58.174 --> 21:00.908
Bring it in! Easy out here!

21:01.010 --> 21:04.045
You don't want any of this
voodoo, do you, Heck?
