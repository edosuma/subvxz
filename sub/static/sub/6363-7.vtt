WEBVTT

00:01.331 --> 00:03.282
<i>Last week...</i>

00:03.362 --> 00:04.591
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah!

00:04.671 --> 00:06.988
<i>A culinary blast from the past...</i>

00:07.068 --> 00:08.802
Groovy, baby.

00:08.837 --> 00:10.270
Whoa, Addison!

00:10.305 --> 00:11.538
<i>Surf and turf.</i>

00:11.573 --> 00:13.373
<i>So many things could go wrong
with this one.</i>

00:13.408 --> 00:17.077
<i>Meant the end of
the road for Mia and Tae-Ho.</i>

00:17.112 --> 00:20.280
We're gonna miss you!

00:20.315 --> 00:21.815
<i>Tonight...</i>

00:21.850 --> 00:22.916
Whoa!

00:22.951 --> 00:24.651
A blindfold?

00:24.686 --> 00:25.686
<i>The top 12...</i>

00:25.720 --> 00:27.020
- Mm.
- What is this?

00:27.055 --> 00:28.599
<i>Have victory in their sights.</i>

00:28.623 --> 00:31.091
We only want a replica
of what Gordon made you.

00:31.125 --> 00:32.670
<i>But the toughest
mystery box of the season...</i>

00:32.694 --> 00:34.128
I can do this!

00:34.162 --> 00:35.339
<i>May leave some junior home cooks</i>

00:35.363 --> 00:36.430
Whoa!

00:36.464 --> 00:37.498
<i>In the dark.</i>

00:37.532 --> 00:38.832
I feel confused.

00:38.867 --> 00:40.033
<i>And then.</i>

00:40.068 --> 00:41.668
- Hurry!
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:41.703 --> 00:44.138
<i>It's a team
challenge for the ages.</i>

00:44.172 --> 00:47.207
Please welcome your VIP guests.

00:47.242 --> 00:48.642
- What the...?
- No way!

00:48.676 --> 00:50.911
We gotta really step it up.

00:55.817 --> 00:59.186
Let's go cook something!

00:59.220 --> 01:01.388
It's time, people!

01:04.759 --> 01:06.927
- Let's go!
- Whoo!

01:06.961 --> 01:09.329
We're in the top 12 right now,
so that means the top 10

01:09.364 --> 01:11.932
is right around the corner
and I'm so much closer

01:11.966 --> 01:13.967
to bringing that trophy
back home to New York.

01:14.002 --> 01:15.402
Let's go, guys.

01:15.436 --> 01:17.104
Oh, mystery box.

01:17.138 --> 01:19.250
When I grow up, I want
to be a professional cook

01:19.274 --> 01:21.074
and a professional tennis player

01:21.109 --> 01:23.410
and I'm in the top of my game
at tennis

01:23.445 --> 01:25.546
and I'm at the top of my game
in the kitchen.

01:25.580 --> 01:28.782
The finale is so close,
I can taste it.

01:28.817 --> 01:30.317
Welcome back, everybody!

01:30.351 --> 01:32.352
Yes, yeah!

01:34.355 --> 01:36.957
You guys ready to find out
what's under your mystery box?

01:36.991 --> 01:40.994
Yes, Chef!

01:41.029 --> 01:45.232
Well, on the count of three,
I want you to lift those boxes.

01:45.266 --> 01:50.671
One, two, three!
Lift!

01:53.408 --> 01:55.909
- What is this?
- Wait, what?

01:55.944 --> 01:57.678
- Are these blindfolds?
- What?

01:57.712 --> 01:59.446
Are you joking?
Come on, guys.

01:59.481 --> 02:00.614
What?

02:00.648 --> 02:03.517
Please, all of you,
grab your blindfolds

02:03.551 --> 02:07.087
and come down here
and take a seat.

02:08.723 --> 02:11.859
A blindfold?
I feel confused.

02:11.893 --> 02:13.360
I'm not sure what's happening.

02:13.395 --> 02:15.095
These look like bras.

02:16.264 --> 02:19.233
Gentlemen.

02:19.267 --> 02:20.801
Ooh!

02:20.835 --> 02:22.202
Oh, God!

02:22.237 --> 02:25.272
<i>Chef Ramsay and Graham pull out
this huge dining table.</i>

02:25.306 --> 02:26.507
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

02:26.541 --> 02:28.242
If they cooked for us
and we have to judge,

02:28.276 --> 02:29.376
this is amazing.

02:29.411 --> 02:31.044
I'm gonna eliminate Gordon.

02:31.079 --> 02:34.848
Now, your mystery boxes contain
no cooking ingredients,

02:34.883 --> 02:37.051
but now you're all
about to enjoy

02:37.085 --> 02:41.255
an incredible mystery dish
that we just cooked for you.

02:41.289 --> 02:43.824
But you're all gonna be
eating that dish blindfolded.

02:43.858 --> 02:45.325
Oh, God.

02:45.360 --> 02:48.329
And you have to use your
other two major foodie senses,

02:48.363 --> 02:51.732
smell and taste,
to identify every single element

02:51.766 --> 02:53.801
in the dish that you're
gonna be eating tonight.

02:53.835 --> 02:54.935
Oh, no.

02:54.969 --> 02:56.437
Because guess what?

02:56.471 --> 03:00.174
You will have to recreate
the exact dish.

03:00.208 --> 03:02.876
Oh!

03:02.911 --> 03:04.044
Oh, God.

03:05.180 --> 03:08.282
Please put on your blindfolds.

03:08.316 --> 03:09.660
I don't know
what's gonna be under there.

03:09.684 --> 03:11.552
Like, I'm a picky eater.

03:11.586 --> 03:14.888
I want to see my food
and see what foods I don't like,

03:14.923 --> 03:17.257
not blindfolded.

03:17.292 --> 03:20.194
I do blind tastings
sometimes with my mom,

03:20.228 --> 03:22.206
so while I'm doing my own stuff,
my mom will call me over

03:22.230 --> 03:24.565
and like, "Taste this
and tell me what's in it,"

03:24.599 --> 03:26.133
so...

03:26.167 --> 03:27.468
I got this.

03:27.502 --> 03:28.779
- Ooh!
- Oh, it smells delicious.

03:28.803 --> 03:30.281
- Ooh, it smells really good.
- It smells really good.

03:30.305 --> 03:36.277
Now, you've all got five minutes
to taste and try to identify

03:36.311 --> 03:38.445
everything on that plate.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.747
Are you ready?

03:39.781 --> 03:41.782
Yes, Chef!

03:41.816 --> 03:43.050
Bon appe-peek.

03:43.084 --> 03:44.095
Wahwah.

03:45.220 --> 03:49.390
Your five minutes starts now!

03:51.960 --> 03:54.495
Even holding this
with my knife the right way?

03:54.529 --> 03:58.032
I take the first bite and
I taste white meat all the way.

03:58.066 --> 04:00.167
It's gotta be either
chicken or turkey.

04:00.201 --> 04:03.737
Mmm, I know what this is,
or do I?

04:06.241 --> 04:08.709
I think I'm eating pork.

04:08.743 --> 04:10.644
I'm definitely
tasting a white meat

04:10.679 --> 04:12.112
with a lot of herbs.

04:12.147 --> 04:14.148
Is it thyme or is it parsley
or is it rosemary?

04:14.182 --> 04:15.516
Look.

04:15.550 --> 04:18.017
I'm tasting carrots, almond...

04:18.053 --> 04:20.387
Mashed potatoes
with green beans.

04:20.422 --> 04:24.191
There's also a sauce
which has some vinegar in it.

04:24.225 --> 04:26.260
Ten seconds.

04:26.294 --> 04:27.538
- Mm, could that be...
- What is this?

04:27.562 --> 04:29.229
Look at Mia.
She's eaten the whole dish.

04:32.133 --> 04:34.601
Three, two, one,

04:34.636 --> 04:35.936
and knives and forks down, guys.

04:35.970 --> 04:38.272
Good job, well done.

04:38.306 --> 04:40.174
So good.

04:40.208 --> 04:42.409
That was amazing,
but I don't know

04:42.444 --> 04:43.844
what I just ate.

04:43.878 --> 04:45.679
How am I supposed
to recreate something

04:45.714 --> 04:47.815
that we don't even know
what it is?

04:47.849 --> 04:49.984
This is gonna be really hard.

04:50.018 --> 04:52.920
Okay, everyone,
please remove your blindfolds.

04:54.389 --> 04:57.358
In this mystery box challenge,
you will all have one hour

04:57.392 --> 05:00.461
to make a dish that was
a mystery to all of you.

05:00.495 --> 05:02.796
In the limited pantry,
you're gonna find

05:02.831 --> 05:04.308
all the ingredients
that you need to make

05:04.332 --> 05:07.735
that mystery dish,
plus a whole lot of other things

05:07.769 --> 05:11.138
that you don't need to succeed.

05:11.172 --> 05:13.908
We only want a replica
of what Gordon made you.

05:13.942 --> 05:18.445
Now, the person or people who
most closely recreate the dish

05:18.480 --> 05:22.483
that you just tasted blindfolded
will get a huge advantage

05:22.517 --> 05:23.684
in the next challenge.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.621
Guys, please stand.

05:29.124 --> 05:33.827
Your 60 minutes to make us...
well, we're not telling you

05:33.862 --> 05:35.863
what the dish was...

05:35.897 --> 05:40.567
that 60 minutes starts now.

05:40.602 --> 05:42.036
- Ah!
- Go, go, go, go!

05:42.070 --> 05:43.737
- Hurry!
- Go!

05:43.772 --> 05:46.640
- Go, go, go!
- Hurry!

05:46.675 --> 05:49.009
- Ah!
- Excuse me!

05:49.044 --> 05:52.379
I think I figured the meat out.
I'm going with steak.

05:52.414 --> 05:54.048
Champagne vinegar?
What?

05:54.082 --> 05:55.482
I'm not sure about the meat

05:55.517 --> 05:58.819
but I'm thinking pork,
so I'm just gonna go with that.

05:58.853 --> 06:01.589
The only thing
that I tasted was beans

06:01.623 --> 06:03.524
so I'm gonna look for beans.

06:06.294 --> 06:08.896
All right, so now they are
in the limited pantry shopping.

06:08.930 --> 06:10.541
They have to get the ingredients
for this one dish

06:10.565 --> 06:13.267
that they have to recreate,
but the don't know what it is.

06:13.301 --> 06:14.812
Well, they've got an idea,
but if they're smart,

06:14.836 --> 06:16.247
what they'll do is they'll
pick up two or three proteins

06:16.271 --> 06:18.973
and cook them all,
taste, dissect, taste, dissect,

06:19.007 --> 06:22.109
and then refer back to what you
were just tasting earlier

06:22.143 --> 06:23.811
and hopefully try
and match that.

06:23.845 --> 06:25.145
It's a big test.

06:28.116 --> 06:30.818
I'm making a pork loin.

06:30.852 --> 06:32.753
I ate the whole plate,

06:32.787 --> 06:34.655
so I am pretty confident
that I know

06:34.689 --> 06:38.058
what is going into this.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.693
I definitely tasted chicken

06:39.728 --> 06:41.962
'cause it's a dry meat
and I'm used to it.

06:41.997 --> 06:44.565
I taste some tomatoes,
only a few.

06:44.599 --> 06:46.233
That's why I'm sautÃ©ing a few.

06:46.268 --> 06:49.003
Mm.

06:49.037 --> 06:51.205
I'm doing a pan-seared pork loin

06:51.239 --> 06:54.675
with some garlic rosemary
mashed potatoes.

06:54.709 --> 06:57.044
I'm feeling good about my dish,
but then you never know.

06:57.078 --> 06:59.780
I could be completely wrong.

06:59.815 --> 07:01.115
Psst, are we in there?

07:01.149 --> 07:02.149
Hey, how are you?

07:02.183 --> 07:03.217
Well...

07:03.251 --> 07:04.285
Trying to get out?

07:04.319 --> 07:05.753
- Yeah.
- Uh, right.

07:05.787 --> 07:07.555
- Feeling confident?
- Yes, Chef?

07:07.589 --> 07:09.590
Tell me what you think
the dish is.

07:09.624 --> 07:10.724
Whisper.

07:10.759 --> 07:13.227
I think the dish
is a chicken breast.

07:13.261 --> 07:14.595
Chicken breast,

07:14.629 --> 07:16.507
and what do you think was
with that chicken breast?

07:16.531 --> 07:18.999
I think that was
with mashed potatoes.

07:19.034 --> 07:20.601
Also some carrots
and green beans.

07:20.635 --> 07:21.635
Carrots and green beans?

07:21.670 --> 07:22.836
Yeah, and then a sauce.

07:22.871 --> 07:25.306
What was it like
eating in the dark like that?

07:25.340 --> 07:27.274
- A little bit scary.
- Was it scary?

07:27.309 --> 07:29.009
Yeah.

07:29.044 --> 07:31.445
You have got 40 minutes
to nail it.

07:31.479 --> 07:32.613
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

07:32.647 --> 07:36.050
Let's go.

07:36.084 --> 07:37.785
Kaitlyn, what do you think
was in that dish

07:37.819 --> 07:39.053
you tasted blindfolded?

07:39.087 --> 07:40.665
I definitely thought
it was a white meat,

07:40.689 --> 07:43.824
so I decided to go with my gut
and do the chicken breast.

07:43.859 --> 07:45.937
So will you talk me through
some of the other flavors

07:45.961 --> 07:47.995
that you're putting together
in this recreation?

07:48.029 --> 07:50.698
I could definitely taste
something sweet in there,

07:50.732 --> 07:53.734
so I grabbed honey molasses
and sweet potato.

07:53.768 --> 07:56.003
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

07:56.037 --> 07:57.638
All right, young man,
how are you doing?

07:57.672 --> 07:59.073
I'm doing great, Chef.

07:59.107 --> 08:00.975
Now, top ten around the corner,
yeah?

08:01.009 --> 08:02.309
- Yes.
- This is a big challenge.

08:02.344 --> 08:03.654
- Very big challenge.
- Don't shout it out,

08:03.678 --> 08:05.356
but what do you think
that main protein was?

08:05.380 --> 08:07.014
Well I'm thinking
the main protein

08:07.048 --> 08:09.116
may be duck or chicken.

08:09.151 --> 08:10.451
Interesting.

08:10.485 --> 08:11.562
That's why I'm cooking the duck
two different ways

08:11.586 --> 08:13.030
by pan-searing one
and by baking one...

08:13.054 --> 08:14.088
Smart.

08:14.122 --> 08:15.589
And I'm also baking the chicken.

08:15.624 --> 08:16.667
See that's very smart,
and then you're gonna take

08:16.691 --> 08:17.958
a little slice off...

08:17.993 --> 08:19.170
And then I'm gonna taste it
and see which one it was.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.771
And then reflect back to it.
That's smart.

08:20.795 --> 08:22.530
Love that way of thinking.
Good luck.

08:22.564 --> 08:25.566
Yes, Chef!

08:25.600 --> 08:28.702
Ten minutes to go.

08:28.737 --> 08:30.448
Taste everything you're cooking
and then reflect back

08:30.472 --> 08:31.539
to what you were tasting.

08:31.573 --> 08:34.241
Let's go!

08:34.275 --> 08:35.308
- Whoa.
- Whoa!

08:35.342 --> 08:36.744
Kya!

08:36.778 --> 08:39.346
I look over at Kya's station
and she started a fire

08:39.381 --> 08:40.581
that's bigger than her.

08:40.615 --> 08:42.349
Kya, just stand back.

08:42.384 --> 08:44.552
That's a big flame!

08:44.586 --> 08:45.619
Whoa!

08:49.606 --> 08:51.138
Whoa!

08:51.218 --> 08:52.252
Kya!

08:52.286 --> 08:53.887
Kya, stand back.

08:53.921 --> 08:55.221
<i>Kya's a really good cook,</i>

08:55.256 --> 08:57.357
but that flame, ooh,
I think it's gonna burn

08:57.391 --> 08:58.858
the kitchen down.

08:58.893 --> 09:00.326
Stand back,
stand back, stand back.

09:00.361 --> 09:02.128
What happened?

09:02.163 --> 09:04.797
It's 'cause your pans up
really high, so turn that down.

09:04.832 --> 09:06.676
Now that's what I call a flambÃ©,
but we need this kitchen.

09:06.700 --> 09:07.767
Yeah.

09:07.802 --> 09:08.912
Please don't burn it down.
You okay?

09:08.936 --> 09:10.403
I...
yeah.

09:10.437 --> 09:12.138
Keep the gas down low, please.

09:12.173 --> 09:16.209
I never knew vinegar
could do a flambÃ©.

09:16.243 --> 09:18.378
Last three minutes, guys.

09:18.412 --> 09:22.549
You should now start thinking
about your plating.

09:22.583 --> 09:23.917
I gotta hurry up.

09:23.951 --> 09:24.991
Let's go, guys!

09:25.019 --> 09:26.286
What happened?

09:26.320 --> 09:27.654
My green beans fell
on the floor.

09:27.688 --> 09:28.755
Is it okay?

09:28.789 --> 09:30.523
- I have leftover ones.
- You do?

09:30.558 --> 09:32.225
Three to be exact.

09:32.259 --> 09:33.893
I'll have to roll with it.

09:33.928 --> 09:36.029
30 seconds to go, guys.

09:36.063 --> 09:37.564
Let's go, come on!

09:37.598 --> 09:38.665
I can do this.

09:40.935 --> 09:45.205
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

09:45.239 --> 09:48.274
six, five, four,

09:48.309 --> 09:52.078
three, two, one, and stop!

09:52.113 --> 09:54.013
Hands in the air!
Well done.

09:55.516 --> 09:56.916
All right!

09:56.951 --> 09:59.185
Now, very carefully,
all of you, please,

09:59.220 --> 10:01.231
bring those amazing dishes
down to the front please.

10:01.255 --> 10:03.923
Let's go.

10:03.958 --> 10:05.592
I really hope
that I got everything right

10:05.626 --> 10:07.894
on the plate,
'cause I have no clue

10:07.928 --> 10:09.229
what I was supposed to cook.

10:09.263 --> 10:10.674
I could have done
something entirely wrong

10:10.698 --> 10:12.632
or I could have done the dish
entirely right,

10:12.666 --> 10:14.400
so I'm really nervous.

10:16.370 --> 10:18.938
You guys ready
to see exactly what dish

10:18.973 --> 10:21.541
you tasted earlier
and had to recreate tonight?

10:21.575 --> 10:23.676
Yes, Chef!

10:25.112 --> 10:28.114
It was a beautiful...

10:28.149 --> 10:32.085
- Pork, pork, pork.
- Chicken, chicken.

10:32.119 --> 10:33.520
- I'm scared.
- Ooh!

10:33.554 --> 10:36.289
The suspense is killing me.

10:36.323 --> 10:38.625
Pan-seared chicken breast.

10:38.659 --> 10:40.660
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

10:40.694 --> 10:42.328
With a mushroom <i> jus,</i>

10:42.363 --> 10:46.032
rosemary and mustard-infused
mashed potatoes,

10:46.067 --> 10:48.501
green beans with sliced almonds,

10:48.536 --> 10:50.370
honey orange-glazed
heirloom carrots

10:50.404 --> 10:52.305
and baby turnips.

10:52.339 --> 10:54.541
Oh, it's chicken.

10:54.575 --> 10:55.886
I thought this was
my chance to win

10:55.910 --> 10:58.845
and I got the wrong protein.

11:00.681 --> 11:04.084
Let's see who got the closest
and who will win

11:04.118 --> 11:05.919
a huge advantage
in the next stage

11:05.953 --> 11:07.353
of the competition.

11:07.388 --> 11:10.190
Right.

11:10.224 --> 11:13.560
Kaitlyn, there's my dish
against your dish.

11:13.594 --> 11:15.195
It looks like I got
most of the elements

11:15.229 --> 11:17.363
that were on Gordon's dish,

11:17.398 --> 11:19.466
so I'm feeling really confident
right now.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.435
Uh, Addison.
Wow.

11:22.470 --> 11:24.137
I got the protein right,

11:24.171 --> 11:28.541
but my dish looks nothing
like Gordon's dish.

11:28.576 --> 11:29.809
Wow.

11:29.844 --> 11:32.612
I don't know if I can
win this challenge.

11:32.646 --> 11:34.914
- Kya, well done.
- Wow.

11:34.949 --> 11:38.084
That looks
incredible, almost identical.

11:38.119 --> 11:40.186
Kya's dish looks amazing.

11:40.221 --> 11:42.055
How can an eight-year-old
do that?

11:42.089 --> 11:44.257
- Ian, well done.
- Thank you.

11:44.291 --> 11:46.359
Looking at
everyone else' dishes,

11:46.393 --> 11:47.794
I don't know how I did,

11:47.828 --> 11:49.863
because even though
I got my protein wrong,

11:49.897 --> 11:53.099
I have a lot of the other
elements correct, so...

11:53.134 --> 11:54.601
Well done.

11:54.635 --> 11:56.703
Maybe I have a shot at this.

11:56.737 --> 11:58.271
All right,
good effort everybody.

11:58.305 --> 12:02.175
The following eight cooks
will return

12:02.209 --> 12:04.177
to their stations when called.

12:05.446 --> 12:07.814
JJ and his pork,
please return to your station.

12:07.848 --> 12:11.418
Amaya and her pork,
please back to your station.

12:11.452 --> 12:13.520
Addison,

12:13.554 --> 12:15.488
Kamilly,

12:15.523 --> 12:17.023
Sam,

12:17.058 --> 12:18.758
Avery,

12:18.793 --> 12:20.560
Jesse,

12:20.594 --> 12:24.297
and Zac, please head back
to your station.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.178
The last time I
was standing upfront,

12:28.202 --> 12:29.869
I was about to face elimination.

12:29.904 --> 12:34.174
This time, I might win,
so it is time to show them

12:34.208 --> 12:36.609
the real Corey.

12:36.644 --> 12:40.580
The four of you had dishes
that got pretty close

12:40.614 --> 12:42.549
to Gordon's delicious
chicken dish.

12:42.583 --> 12:43.850
Oh, yes!

12:43.884 --> 12:46.252
It's time to see
who's the closest

12:46.287 --> 12:49.322
by finding out how they taste.

12:49.357 --> 12:51.902
Right, first dish we'd
like to take a much closer look at,

12:51.926 --> 12:55.195
please step forward.
Kya.

12:55.229 --> 12:58.031
Kya's dish is beautiful.

12:58.065 --> 13:00.967
I wish I had Kya's dish.

13:01.002 --> 13:03.370
Kya, describe your dish, please.

13:03.404 --> 13:06.473
So I made a
pan-seared chicken breast

13:06.507 --> 13:09.642
with mashed potatoes
and green beans and carrots.

13:14.281 --> 13:16.716
Mm, that chicken breast
is delicious.

13:16.751 --> 13:18.161
The only things you've missed
are the mushrooms

13:18.185 --> 13:20.620
and the turnips,
but you got the sweetness right

13:20.654 --> 13:21.888
for the caramelization.

13:21.922 --> 13:24.257
Carrots, delicious.
Mash, delicious.

13:24.292 --> 13:26.292
You've plated it beautifully.

13:26.327 --> 13:28.762
All the elements
that you have cooked tonight

13:28.796 --> 13:31.931
are equally as tasty as mine.

13:31.966 --> 13:34.534
Honestly,
whether you like it or not,

13:34.568 --> 13:38.004
at eight years of age,
you are a freak.

13:40.207 --> 13:41.408
Really good job.

13:41.442 --> 13:42.642
Thank you.

13:42.677 --> 13:44.978
Whoo!

13:45.012 --> 13:47.747
- Whoo!
- Good job, Kya.

13:47.782 --> 13:49.416
- Are you so happy?
- Yeah.

13:49.450 --> 13:52.052
Next up, please, Corey.

13:53.521 --> 13:54.621
Whoo!

13:54.655 --> 13:57.123
Great job, Corey!

13:57.158 --> 13:59.659
All right, please
describe your dish.

13:59.694 --> 14:03.196
Well, I did baked
chicken with mashed potatoes

14:03.230 --> 14:04.898
and green beans and mushrooms.

14:04.932 --> 14:07.000
So, I mean,
looking at this dish,

14:07.034 --> 14:09.235
compare and contrast,
mashed potato on the bottom,

14:09.270 --> 14:10.437
mashed potato on the bottom.

14:10.471 --> 14:13.373
Chicken, chicken.
Mushroom, mushroom.

14:13.407 --> 14:15.308
Green beans, green beans,

14:15.343 --> 14:19.913
and I think that says a lot
about your attention to detail.

14:22.950 --> 14:25.085
Your chicken tastes delicious.

14:25.119 --> 14:26.519
You missed the root vegetable.

14:26.554 --> 14:28.065
You missed the almonds
in the green beans

14:28.089 --> 14:29.456
and the actual sauce,

14:29.490 --> 14:31.558
but for all the other components
that you did get,

14:31.592 --> 14:33.136
I think it says a lot
about you as a cook

14:33.160 --> 14:35.428
and as a mature young man.

14:35.463 --> 14:36.930
- Good job.
- Thank you, Chef.

14:38.265 --> 14:41.001
- Good job, Corey!
- Go Corey!

14:41.035 --> 14:43.770
Please bring your dish up, Ian.

14:43.804 --> 14:46.506
Whoo!

14:48.609 --> 14:50.710
Now, you have
a lot of things missing,

14:50.745 --> 14:54.214
but we brought you up here
because your chicken breast

14:54.248 --> 14:55.949
compared to Gordon's
chicken breast

14:55.983 --> 14:58.184
is almost spot-on,

14:58.219 --> 15:01.054
but I think the thing
that really set us over

15:01.088 --> 15:03.156
was your roasted parsnips.

15:03.190 --> 15:05.692
Now, there are not
roasted parsnips on our dish.

15:05.726 --> 15:07.627
There's the baby turnips,
the heirloom carrots,

15:07.662 --> 15:10.297
but the fact
that you're eight years old

15:10.331 --> 15:12.832
and your palate,
even when blindfolded,

15:12.867 --> 15:14.401
could pick out and discern

15:14.435 --> 15:17.137
that sweet, roasted root
vegetable flavor

15:17.171 --> 15:19.205
was amazing to us.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.107
Thank you.

15:25.379 --> 15:27.047
The chicken is delicious.

15:27.081 --> 15:30.083
The parsnips roasted
really bring that flavor

15:30.117 --> 15:32.252
of baby turnips
and glazed heirloom carrots

15:32.286 --> 15:33.620
in from Gordon's dish.

15:33.654 --> 15:35.655
Tomato's definitely not here,

15:35.690 --> 15:38.191
but overall
really impressive job.

15:38.226 --> 15:39.359
Thank you.

15:39.393 --> 15:40.360
- Whoo!
- Nice job, Ian!

15:40.394 --> 15:42.329
- Whoo!
- Great job, Ian.

15:42.363 --> 15:44.864
Last up, step forward, Kaitlyn.

15:44.899 --> 15:46.610
I'm feeling pretty
confident about my dish

15:46.634 --> 15:49.236
because my chicken
is pretty much identical

15:49.270 --> 15:51.171
to the one that they made,

15:51.205 --> 15:53.373
so I'm hoping
that gives me an advantage.

15:53.407 --> 15:54.975
First of all, protein nailed.

15:55.009 --> 15:57.210
Mashed potatoes, chicken
on both plates, identical.

15:57.245 --> 15:58.622
I'm amazed you missed
those carrots.

15:58.646 --> 15:59.713
Mm.

15:59.747 --> 16:01.481
However, great sear
on the chicken,

16:01.516 --> 16:03.383
underneath and on top,
all right?

16:03.417 --> 16:04.495
Green beans, why only three?

16:04.519 --> 16:05.752
Are we on a diet?

16:05.786 --> 16:07.821
Well, I blanched a lot of them,

16:07.855 --> 16:10.290
but I dropped them on the floor

16:10.324 --> 16:11.902
and I only had three
that weren't dropped

16:11.926 --> 16:13.770
on the floor, so that's
all I could get on the plate.

16:13.794 --> 16:14.872
One each, one for Christina,
one for Graham,

16:14.896 --> 16:16.463
and one for me.
That's very kind.

16:19.166 --> 16:20.934
Mmm, here's the thing.

16:20.968 --> 16:22.802
You got the most important thing
right, okay,

16:22.837 --> 16:24.114
which was the protein,
the chicken.

16:24.138 --> 16:25.305
Well done on that.

16:25.339 --> 16:26.783
Mashed potatoes, delicious.
Really good.

16:26.807 --> 16:28.475
Nice and seasoned, garlic-y.

16:28.509 --> 16:30.377
Just needs some carrots.

16:30.411 --> 16:31.745
It needs some sauce,

16:31.779 --> 16:35.081
and you were literally
95% of the way there.

16:35.116 --> 16:36.149
Really good job.

16:36.184 --> 16:37.417
- Thank you, Chef.
- Well done.

16:37.451 --> 16:39.386
Great job, Kaitlyn!

16:39.420 --> 16:42.522
- Good job, good job!
- Thanks.

16:42.557 --> 16:44.825
That was a very,
very touch challenge.

16:44.859 --> 16:47.794
Four incredible versions
of that chicken dish

16:47.828 --> 16:51.131
that you all tasted blindfolded.

16:51.165 --> 16:53.200
It was very close.

16:53.234 --> 16:57.971
However, there were two dishes
that really stood out.

16:58.005 --> 17:00.507
Both will get a huge advantage

17:00.541 --> 17:02.676
in the next challenge.

17:02.710 --> 17:03.777
The first dish.

17:03.811 --> 17:06.546
It was refined,
seasoned beautifully,

17:06.580 --> 17:08.214
and that dish belongs to...

17:15.253 --> 17:16.714
It was very close.

17:16.794 --> 17:19.909
However, there were two dishes
that really stood out.

17:19.943 --> 17:24.781
Both will get a huge advantage
in the next challenge.

17:26.049 --> 17:27.050
The first dish.

17:27.084 --> 17:29.085
It was refined,
seasoned beautifully.

17:29.119 --> 17:30.386
It's you, Kya.

17:30.421 --> 17:31.665
Couple of things missing,
but still

17:31.689 --> 17:34.157
an excellent serious effort.

17:34.191 --> 17:37.460
That dish belongs to...

17:37.494 --> 17:39.162
Kaitlyn, congratulations.

17:39.196 --> 17:41.097
- Whoo!
- Go, Kaitlyn!

17:41.131 --> 17:42.409
- Good job, Kaitlyn.
- Great job!

17:42.433 --> 17:45.134
Now, the winning dish
of the night was just magical.

17:45.169 --> 17:48.204
It showed all the elements
of a great chef in the making

17:48.238 --> 17:51.474
and the presentation
was mind-blowing.

17:51.508 --> 17:54.977
Congratulations
to the dish of the night...

17:55.012 --> 17:56.079
Kya!

17:56.113 --> 17:57.947
- Whoo!
- Go, Kya!

17:57.981 --> 17:59.716
- Go, Kya!
- Great job, guys!

17:59.750 --> 18:02.452
Both of you will of
course be given a huge advantage,

18:02.486 --> 18:06.622
but first, let us show everybody
what that next challenge is.

18:06.657 --> 18:08.401
Could everybody else come down
and join them, please?

18:08.425 --> 18:09.792
Let's go.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.004
Even though I
didn't get first place,

18:11.028 --> 18:13.029
I'm really happy
that I got second place,

18:13.063 --> 18:15.231
but I know I kind of have
to step up my game now.

18:15.265 --> 18:17.667
I mean, Kya is only eight,

18:17.701 --> 18:19.569
and she had more ingredients
than I did

18:19.603 --> 18:23.639
and I think
that is very impressive.

18:23.674 --> 18:25.675
Right, as we all know,

18:25.709 --> 18:28.411
this is the most famous kitchen
in America,

18:28.445 --> 18:31.147
but do you know
what else we have here?

18:31.181 --> 18:32.281
Oh, God.

18:32.316 --> 18:37.053
We have
a world class restaurant!

18:37.087 --> 18:38.121
Oh, my gosh!
It lights up!

18:38.155 --> 18:39.489
Whoo!

18:39.523 --> 18:42.959
Tonight, that amazing restaurant

18:42.993 --> 18:46.462
is gonna be filled
with VIP guests.

18:48.766 --> 18:51.434
We have invited
a very special group.

18:51.468 --> 18:53.936
These people inspire
so many people

18:53.971 --> 18:55.338
each and every day.

18:55.372 --> 18:57.073
- Who are they?
- Famous people.

18:57.107 --> 19:00.843
You guys are gonna be running
the restaurant service.

19:00.878 --> 19:03.079
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

19:03.113 --> 19:05.715
You'll be working
in two teams of six.

19:05.749 --> 19:07.517
Kya and Kaitlyn,

19:07.551 --> 19:10.219
because you had the best dishes
in the last challenge,

19:10.254 --> 19:12.989
you will be
tonight's team captains.

19:13.023 --> 19:14.390
Hey, high five.

19:14.425 --> 19:17.126
Now, you guys are the new
culinary faces in America,

19:17.161 --> 19:20.863
and because you are the new
culinary faces in America,

19:20.898 --> 19:22.632
for this challenge
you are going to have

19:22.666 --> 19:27.737
to use ingredients and produce
from new places in America.

19:27.771 --> 19:29.272
Huh?

19:29.306 --> 19:32.075
Kya and Kaitlyn,
please stay right here.

19:32.109 --> 19:33.553
If all of the other home cooks
can just move

19:33.577 --> 19:36.179
to the side here, please.

19:36.213 --> 19:38.481
Gentlemen, please.

19:38.515 --> 19:41.384
It's never good
when they step out.

19:42.620 --> 19:43.620
- Oh.
- Ooh-la-la.

19:43.654 --> 19:45.788
- What?
- A box?

19:45.823 --> 19:48.992
- Oh-ho!
- "New" something.

19:49.026 --> 19:51.928
- How do we open these things?
- I have no idea.

19:51.962 --> 19:53.963
Oh, gosh.

19:56.667 --> 19:58.067
Kya and Kaitlyn,

19:58.102 --> 20:00.536
one team will have
to make the dish

20:00.571 --> 20:06.142
from a crate of ingredients
from New...

20:06.176 --> 20:08.911
- Ooh!
- Yeah, England!

20:08.946 --> 20:10.257
And the other team
will have to use a crate

20:10.281 --> 20:14.150
of ingredients from New...

20:14.184 --> 20:15.518
Mexico.

20:15.553 --> 20:17.153
Yes.

20:17.187 --> 20:19.822
Kya, you had the very best dish
in the last challenge,

20:19.857 --> 20:22.025
so you can either choose
your crate

20:22.059 --> 20:23.826
or you can get first pick

20:23.861 --> 20:25.562
when you choose your teams.

20:25.596 --> 20:27.230
I'm gonna choose the crates

20:27.264 --> 20:29.766
and I'm gonna choose
New England.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.568
All right, Kaitlyn,
you and your team

20:31.602 --> 20:33.036
will be cooking
with the ingredients

20:33.070 --> 20:35.071
from New Mexico.

20:35.105 --> 20:37.307
Please come up.
Grab your team captain aprons.

20:37.341 --> 20:39.609
We'll begin picking teams.

20:39.643 --> 20:40.877
Thank you.

20:40.911 --> 20:42.122
Kya, you are the
captain of the red team,

20:42.146 --> 20:43.323
and, Kaitlyn,
you'll be the captain

20:43.347 --> 20:45.148
of the blue team.

20:45.182 --> 20:47.550
Now, Kaitlyn,
you get to pick first.

20:47.585 --> 20:48.885
I'm choosing this person

20:48.919 --> 20:51.754
because they have
great leadership qualities.

20:51.789 --> 20:53.056
Addison.

20:53.090 --> 20:54.734
Wow, Addison,
first pick of the day.

20:54.758 --> 20:58.261
This is awesome.

20:58.295 --> 20:59.762
Number one, I'm first pick.

20:59.797 --> 21:02.265
Number two,
I get the New Mexico crate.

21:02.299 --> 21:03.533
What could go wrong?

21:03.567 --> 21:04.901
All right, Kya.

21:04.935 --> 21:07.704
I'm gonna choose this person
because I know they are

21:07.738 --> 21:09.372
a really strong cook.

21:09.406 --> 21:10.573
Avery.

21:10.608 --> 21:12.308
Wow, interesting.

21:12.343 --> 21:14.444
They'll be able
to keep the team on track.

21:14.478 --> 21:15.578
Zac.

21:15.613 --> 21:16.890
Welcome to the blue team.

21:16.914 --> 21:18.381
- Sam.
- Kamilly.

21:18.415 --> 21:19.449
Kamilly.

21:19.483 --> 21:20.516
Welcome to the team.

21:20.551 --> 21:21.584
I'm choosing Corey.

21:21.619 --> 21:22.862
Welcome to the red team, Corey.

21:22.886 --> 21:24.120
And I'm choosing JJ.

21:24.154 --> 21:25.889
Nice, JJ. Welcome
to the blue team.

21:25.923 --> 21:28.658
- Kya.
- Jesse.

21:28.692 --> 21:31.928
Kaitlyn, you're choosing
for both teams here.

21:31.962 --> 21:34.697
I hope that I'm gonna
be on the New Mexico team

21:34.732 --> 21:37.367
'cause the Dominican Republic
and New Mexico

21:37.401 --> 21:39.435
have a lot of things in common

21:39.470 --> 21:43.339
like beans and beans
and more beans.

21:43.374 --> 21:45.175
The person I'm choosing
is Amaya.

21:45.209 --> 21:47.110
Wow, welcome to the blue team.

21:47.144 --> 21:48.878
Ian, pick up your red apron,
please.

21:48.913 --> 21:50.113
Excellent.

21:50.147 --> 21:52.248
Please go and join your teams.

21:52.283 --> 21:54.784
Good choices, well done.

21:54.818 --> 21:57.220
Now red team,
please open your crate

21:57.254 --> 22:00.457
of New England ingredients.

22:00.491 --> 22:03.893
Oh!

22:03.928 --> 22:07.063
Now in that crate,
you have things like mussels,

22:07.097 --> 22:11.768
cod, clams, Vermont cheddar,
celery, parsley, and bacon.

22:11.802 --> 22:13.503
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

22:13.537 --> 22:16.072
Blue team,
please open your crate.

22:16.106 --> 22:18.675
Ooh!

22:18.709 --> 22:21.678
In that New Mexico
crate, you have things like

22:21.712 --> 22:25.481
pork tenderloin, chorizo,
corn, tomatoes, avocados,

22:25.516 --> 22:27.817
limes, and tomatillos.

22:27.852 --> 22:29.652
Now, each team
will have 90 minutes

22:29.687 --> 22:32.755
to transform their ingredients
into not one

22:32.790 --> 22:35.491
but 31 MasterChef worthy dishes.

22:37.328 --> 22:42.665
31 VIPs in 90 minutes!

22:42.700 --> 22:45.034
This is gonna be terrifying.

22:45.069 --> 22:48.671
Now, your guests will decide
tonight's winning team.

22:48.706 --> 22:51.107
And then two people
from the losing team

22:51.142 --> 22:52.742
will be leaving
the MasterChef kitchen

22:52.776 --> 22:55.211
after this challenge tonight.

22:55.246 --> 23:00.517
Please take your crates
back to your stations.

23:00.551 --> 23:03.586
It is pretty difficult
planning and making a dish

23:03.621 --> 23:05.655
without knowing
who the VIPs are,

23:05.689 --> 23:09.526
but it's the top 12
so I cannot lose this one.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.461
I have to do everything
in my power

23:11.495 --> 23:13.363
to make sure
that I'm on the winning team.

23:13.397 --> 23:16.900
Now, your 90 minutes
to create 31 stunning dishes,

23:16.934 --> 23:20.937
your time starts...

23:20.971 --> 23:22.372
now!

23:22.406 --> 23:24.140
- Whoa!
- All right, what's your ideas?

23:24.175 --> 23:26.319
- Let's add the mussels.
- Yeah, let's add the mussels.

23:26.343 --> 23:29.646
My team is making
a New England clam bake

23:29.680 --> 23:31.815
with cod cakes
and a celery salad,

23:31.849 --> 23:34.350
so my team strategy
is to communicate

23:34.385 --> 23:37.053
and really make this dish
restaurant quality.

23:37.087 --> 23:38.154
I'm making the pork.

23:38.189 --> 23:39.499
And I'm making
the avocado mousse.

23:39.523 --> 23:40.957
Well, it's basically guacamole.

23:40.991 --> 23:42.035
Okay, I could make my salsa.

23:42.059 --> 23:43.860
Yes, that's a really good idea.

23:43.894 --> 23:45.872
We are serving a pork
dish with black bean cakes

23:45.896 --> 23:47.864
succotash, guacamole,

23:47.898 --> 23:49.966
and a really
amazing tomatillo sauce.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.301
We got this, guys.
We got this.

23:51.335 --> 23:53.436
Let's do this.

23:57.174 --> 23:59.075
Wow, what an array
of ingredients.

23:59.110 --> 24:00.120
I mean, it's going
to be fascinating

24:00.144 --> 24:01.411
to see what they do.

24:01.445 --> 24:02.522
But let's keep in mind
they are cooking

24:02.546 --> 24:03.513
for 31 restaurant guests.

24:03.547 --> 24:05.315
Right.

24:05.349 --> 24:07.694
We've never put this
type of challenge in front of them.

24:07.718 --> 24:09.085
Come on, let's do this quick!

24:09.120 --> 24:10.420
Teamwork, guys.

24:10.454 --> 24:13.289
So, Kaitlyn,
she has a strong crew.

24:13.324 --> 24:14.691
She chose some
of the older people.

24:14.725 --> 24:16.203
And Addison, Zac, Kamilly,

24:16.227 --> 24:18.962
they've all been
on a team challenge before,

24:18.996 --> 24:20.574
so they know how
to work with one another.

24:20.598 --> 24:22.342
And I think there's value
to Kaitlyn's team there.

24:22.366 --> 24:24.200
Oh, my gosh,
look at how smooth it is.

24:24.235 --> 24:27.170
We got this, guys.
Just work together!

24:27.204 --> 24:28.338
How's it going, everybody?

24:28.372 --> 24:29.405
Good!

24:29.440 --> 24:31.074
Sam, cut the potatoes in half.

24:31.108 --> 24:32.175
I am.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.044
Good news, I got exactly
32 pieces of corn.

24:34.078 --> 24:35.889
Get more than that
just in case we screw one up.

24:35.913 --> 24:36.980
All right.

24:37.014 --> 24:38.715
Kya chose the New England box.

24:38.749 --> 24:40.216
She's a serious foodie.

24:40.251 --> 24:42.185
She gets excited
about the ingredients.

24:42.219 --> 24:43.463
She has an extraordinary palate.

24:43.487 --> 24:44.754
She does.

24:44.789 --> 24:46.433
You can start the seasoning
for the fish cakes.

24:46.457 --> 24:47.524
Okay.

24:47.558 --> 24:49.192
The question really becomes
for me,

24:49.226 --> 24:51.895
"Is Kya an authoritative
enough voice to lead her team?"

24:51.929 --> 24:53.630
She's the youngest kid
in the competition.

24:53.664 --> 24:54.998
Come on, guys!
You can do it!

24:55.032 --> 24:56.733
I believe in you!

24:56.767 --> 24:58.368
Guys, start on the bean cakes.

24:58.402 --> 25:00.003
Someone go get a food processor!

25:00.037 --> 25:01.838
Food processor.

25:04.008 --> 25:05.575
Wonder when the VIPs
are gonna be here.

25:05.609 --> 25:06.620
Doesn't matter.
We just gotta focus.

25:06.644 --> 25:07.677
Yeah.

25:10.915 --> 25:13.049
Right, red team, blue team!

25:13.084 --> 25:16.252
Your VIP guests
are about to arrive.

25:16.287 --> 25:17.587
What?

25:17.621 --> 25:19.756
Tonight's special guests
know good food.

25:19.790 --> 25:23.159
They have spent
a lifetime cooking it.

25:23.194 --> 25:26.262
Please welcome
very special guests...

25:28.000 --> 25:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

25:37.498 --> 25:40.500
Tonight's special guests
know good food.

25:40.534 --> 25:44.170
They have spent
a lifetime cooking it.

25:44.205 --> 25:49.809
The people who you
are cooking for tonight...

25:49.844 --> 25:52.679
Please welcome...

25:52.713 --> 25:54.013
grannies!

25:54.048 --> 25:55.081
- Hi.
- Hi!

25:55.116 --> 25:57.317
- Oh, my gosh!
- No way!

25:57.351 --> 25:58.485
Welcome, ladies!

25:58.519 --> 26:00.220
Grandmas!

26:00.254 --> 26:01.287
Hi.

26:01.322 --> 26:03.022
Grandmas definitely know food.

26:03.057 --> 26:04.924
They've been cooking
for their entire life

26:04.959 --> 26:07.460
and I want to win this challenge
today for my grandma.

26:07.495 --> 26:08.805
Whoa, look it!
There's a huge line!

26:08.829 --> 26:10.597
I wish my grandma was here!

26:10.631 --> 26:14.734
This just went from VIPs
to VIGs!

26:14.769 --> 26:16.870
These are grandmothers.
They know good cooking.

26:16.904 --> 26:18.972
- How you doing, darling?
- Hi!

26:19.006 --> 26:21.774
These grandmothers,
if they're, like, 50 years old,

26:21.809 --> 26:24.210
then they've probably had
a lot of good meals,

26:24.245 --> 26:27.147
so we gotta really step it up.

26:27.181 --> 26:28.515
Lots of people to feed,
you guys!

26:28.549 --> 26:31.151
Hurry up!

26:31.185 --> 26:33.119
Hey, Sam, can you switch with me

26:33.154 --> 26:34.621
because I cannot
get the skin off.

26:34.655 --> 26:36.289
Start forming those bean cakes.

26:36.323 --> 26:39.125
We cannot disappoint
the grannies!

26:39.160 --> 26:42.328
I can't believe these kids
are just eight, nine,

26:42.363 --> 26:44.531
ten, eleven.

26:44.565 --> 26:47.400
They exceed what I can do.

26:47.435 --> 26:50.069
At eight, nine
and ten years old,

26:50.104 --> 26:51.705
I wasn't even allowed
in the kitchen.

26:51.739 --> 26:54.107
These children are really
dedicated to cooking,

26:54.141 --> 26:56.576
so it's going to be
an amazing feast.

26:56.610 --> 26:59.446
And I can't wait!
I want to taste this food!

26:59.480 --> 27:01.614
Now they know
who they're cooking for,

27:01.649 --> 27:04.017
a dining room full of grannies.

27:04.051 --> 27:05.385
Just think of some of the wealth

27:05.419 --> 27:07.887
of the cooking experience
in terms of what they've done.

27:07.922 --> 27:10.267
And, I mean, these are
grannies from all over the country,

27:10.291 --> 27:11.891
so you got
a million different styles

27:11.926 --> 27:14.694
and backgrounds,
ingredients that they know.

27:14.729 --> 27:18.064
Come on, guys!

27:18.099 --> 27:19.176
Kaity, can you come
and taste this

27:19.200 --> 27:20.500
when you have a chance?

27:20.534 --> 27:21.835
I'll be right over.

27:21.869 --> 27:23.036
They keep on breaking.

27:23.070 --> 27:24.771
How are we gonna do this?
They're mushy.

27:24.805 --> 27:26.806
Put it on here to form, okay?

27:26.841 --> 27:29.142
So the bottom can
get coated evenly.

27:29.176 --> 27:30.777
Wowser!
These things are opening!

27:30.811 --> 27:32.011
Halfway, guys!

27:32.046 --> 27:36.016
45 minutes gone,
45 minutes to go.

27:37.618 --> 27:38.695
All right, guys, Kaitlyn.

27:38.719 --> 27:40.086
- Hi.
- Tell me, what's the dish

27:40.121 --> 27:42.522
that you're gonna be serving
tonight to our VIPs?

27:42.556 --> 27:45.024
Spice-roasted pork
with chorizo succotash,

27:45.059 --> 27:48.862
avocado mousse, bean cakes,
tomatillo salsa.

27:48.896 --> 27:50.864
Now that you know
who you're guests are,

27:50.898 --> 27:52.299
is there anything
about your dish

27:52.333 --> 27:55.368
that worries you knowing
who your audience is tonight?

27:55.403 --> 27:57.337
Is there anything
too spicy, guys?

27:57.371 --> 27:58.371
Yes, exactly.

27:58.406 --> 27:59.906
- No.
- No, Chef.

27:59.940 --> 28:01.741
Kaitlyn, do you still want
to add the cactus?

28:01.776 --> 28:02.909
- No, no, no, no.
- No.

28:02.943 --> 28:04.544
The cactuses just make
the weird flavor.

28:04.578 --> 28:06.346
Be willing to adapt

28:06.380 --> 28:07.758
based on who you know
you're cooking for.

28:07.782 --> 28:09.126
- You guys make the call.
- Yes, Chef.

28:09.150 --> 28:10.327
All right, keep yourself
on time.

28:10.351 --> 28:11.518
- Good luck.
- Yes, Chef!

28:11.552 --> 28:12.729
I'm gonna help you
cut some celery.

28:12.753 --> 28:13.820
No, I'm okay!

28:13.854 --> 28:15.355
Just let me cut one, Ian.

28:15.389 --> 28:16.656
I don't need any help.

28:16.691 --> 28:18.491
Right, Kya,
what are you cooking?

28:18.526 --> 28:20.126
A New England clam bake.

28:20.161 --> 28:23.296
There's gonna be bacon,
some mussels and clams.

28:23.330 --> 28:24.374
So it's a mussel and clam bake.

28:24.398 --> 28:25.799
- Yes.
- Wow, okay.

28:25.833 --> 28:27.511
But a traditional clam bake
doesn't have mussels in there,

28:27.535 --> 28:29.202
so you're diversing it
a little bit.

28:29.236 --> 28:30.414
I'm making it into, like,
a restaurant quality.

28:30.438 --> 28:31.938
Restaurant quality.
That's great news.

28:31.972 --> 28:34.140
Um, Sam and Jesse are gonna
make some cod cakes.

28:34.175 --> 28:36.710
Cod cakes, so
almost like a fish cake?

28:36.744 --> 28:37.844
Yes.

28:37.878 --> 28:39.679
We're also doing
a celery salad, Chef.

28:39.714 --> 28:40.980
Okay, good,

28:41.015 --> 28:42.125
and what are you doing here?

28:42.149 --> 28:43.149
Celery salad.

28:43.184 --> 28:44.517
That's not fit for salads.

28:44.552 --> 28:46.496
It looks like trimmings
you'd serve to your rabbit.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.521
I'm not gonna serve it
like that, Chef.

28:48.556 --> 28:50.056
Kya, come around.

28:50.091 --> 28:51.324
Come on, guys.

28:51.359 --> 28:53.827
I'm trying to help you
and I want you to shine.

28:53.861 --> 28:56.329
We have a restaurant
full of VIP guests tonight.

28:56.364 --> 28:58.465
You don't mandoline celery.

28:58.499 --> 29:00.667
Look, let me just show you
something really simple.

29:00.701 --> 29:03.069
That's the way you slice celery,

29:03.104 --> 29:04.971
but we've wasted all this,

29:05.006 --> 29:07.640
and also, what's that there
on my thumb?

29:07.675 --> 29:09.109
- Dirt.
- Dirt.

29:09.143 --> 29:10.988
So you didn't even wash
the celery before you sliced it.

29:11.012 --> 29:12.712
- Okay.
- These are VIP guests.

29:12.747 --> 29:14.881
They have very,
very high standards

29:14.915 --> 29:17.317
and one thing they don't
want to taste is dirt.

29:17.351 --> 29:18.652
Yes, Chef!

29:18.686 --> 29:21.521
Just go and do the garlic
and I can do the salad.

29:21.555 --> 29:23.690
- Yeah, I'll do the garlic.
- Let's do it!

29:25.927 --> 29:27.727
Less than 20 minutes to go!

29:28.863 --> 29:30.030
We gotta start plating!

29:30.064 --> 29:31.097
I'll do it.
I got it.

29:31.132 --> 29:32.209
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

29:32.233 --> 29:33.800
Come on, guys, we can do it!
Let's go!

29:33.834 --> 29:35.835
Come on, get that celery
mixed together!

29:35.870 --> 29:37.037
I know, I know!

29:37.071 --> 29:38.371
Unfortunately, the red team,

29:38.406 --> 29:41.041
Ian has absolutely annihilated
the celery.

29:41.075 --> 29:43.510
- Ian, find a job!
- I'm trying to!

29:43.544 --> 29:45.055
- I'm so happy Avery's on salad.
- Mm-hmm.

29:45.079 --> 29:46.123
Okay, come on, come on,
we gotta make 'em.

29:46.147 --> 29:47.347
Yeah, I know.

29:47.381 --> 29:48.759
This is the most vocal
I've ever seen Sam.

29:48.783 --> 29:50.684
There's another shaper
somewhere.

29:50.718 --> 29:52.262
Jesse, I mean,
he just seemed out of it.

29:52.286 --> 29:55.188
Also, he's very quiet.
He won't step up.

29:55.223 --> 29:56.990
- Ooh, you almost cut me.
- Sorry.

29:57.024 --> 29:59.059
With the blue team,
JJ is doing really nice

29:59.093 --> 30:00.771
on the pork, right?
It was cooked beautifully.

30:00.795 --> 30:01.795
- Thinner.
- Thinner?

30:01.829 --> 30:02.862
Yes.

30:02.897 --> 30:04.297
It is a battle, I think,

30:04.332 --> 30:06.499
of the dominant personality
on Kaitlyn's blue team

30:06.534 --> 30:08.235
because she does have
strong personalities

30:08.269 --> 30:09.536
and older home cooks.

30:09.570 --> 30:12.472
Hurry, hurry!

30:12.506 --> 30:15.041
Kaitlyn, stop!
Screaming is not gonna help!

30:15.076 --> 30:17.243
My concern is the stress
is really starting

30:17.278 --> 30:18.878
to paralyze Kaitlyn.

30:18.913 --> 30:20.924
The bowls on the
red team, nothing in them,

30:20.948 --> 30:22.415
and look at the blue team.

30:22.450 --> 30:23.950
They're 2/3 of the way.

30:23.985 --> 30:25.552
Come on, guys!
Let's go do this!

30:25.586 --> 30:26.596
Oh, my God, where's the pork?

30:26.620 --> 30:27.621
We need more...

30:27.655 --> 30:29.756
Guys, just get it on.
Just get it on.

30:29.790 --> 30:31.558
I don't think they quite realize

30:31.592 --> 30:35.028
the amount of work
to get the volume up to speed

30:35.062 --> 30:36.496
to deliver 31 plates.

30:36.530 --> 30:37.664
Just get the mousse on.

30:37.698 --> 30:38.742
It doesn't matter
how pretty it looks,

30:38.766 --> 30:39.833
just get it on.

30:39.867 --> 30:41.301
It does matter
how pretty it looks!

30:41.335 --> 30:42.435
It doesn't matter!

30:42.470 --> 30:43.670
Yes, it does!

30:43.704 --> 30:44.871
Why?

30:44.905 --> 30:45.983
The blue team's way ahead of us.

30:46.007 --> 30:47.374
We're falling way behind.

30:47.408 --> 30:48.541
Let's start to plate.

30:48.576 --> 30:50.877
Let's get the foods,
you guys, fast!

30:50.912 --> 30:52.579
Fish cakes are coming, guys.

30:52.613 --> 30:55.015
Okay, why does some pork
have three, some has four?

30:55.049 --> 30:56.316
One has two.

30:56.350 --> 30:58.451
- Wait, what?
- Why are you doing this, guys?

30:58.486 --> 30:59.630
Why does it have four?

30:59.654 --> 31:01.521
- You have enough pork?
- Um...

31:01.555 --> 31:04.357
How many more plates do you need
to have pork on 'em, Kaitlyn?

31:04.392 --> 31:05.859
Uh, 11.

31:05.893 --> 31:07.237
- Is this all we have?
- Yes, Chef.

31:07.261 --> 31:08.472
Okay, so we're not
gonna have enough.

31:08.496 --> 31:10.964
You're gonna need
to go two pieces per.

31:10.998 --> 31:12.265
- Hurry...
- Guys!

31:12.300 --> 31:13.266
Listen, he's got,
like, six slices of pork.

31:13.301 --> 31:14.634
Kaitlyn, stop freaking out.

31:14.669 --> 31:16.446
You can't serve, like,
eight dishes without pork on it.

31:16.470 --> 31:18.972
Go back and take one piece.
Move it like that.

31:19.006 --> 31:20.173
Yes, Chef.

31:20.208 --> 31:23.176
90 seconds to go!

31:23.211 --> 31:25.312
Fast, you guys.
Work clean!

31:25.346 --> 31:27.314
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Teamwork, guys.

31:27.348 --> 31:28.381
One on the pork.

31:28.416 --> 31:29.849
Come on, guys.
We can do this!

31:29.884 --> 31:32.752
- Celery, cod cake, corn!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

31:32.787 --> 31:34.387
Last minute!

31:34.422 --> 31:36.233
This one doesn't have a chip.
This one doesn't have a chip!

31:36.257 --> 31:37.324
Hurry, hurry!

31:37.358 --> 31:39.826
Hurry up, guys.
This one needs more clams.

31:39.861 --> 31:42.462
- Ten, nine...
- Hurry up, hurry up!

31:42.497 --> 31:44.764
- Eight, seven, six...
- Quickly, guys!

31:44.799 --> 31:46.967
- Five, four...
- This one doesn't look...

31:47.001 --> 31:50.770
Three, two, one, and stop!

31:50.805 --> 31:52.572
- Oh, my...
- Well done!

31:52.607 --> 31:54.007
Whoo!

31:58.715 --> 31:59.916
Come on, guys!

31:59.950 --> 32:01.651
Make 'em perfect
for the grannies.

32:01.685 --> 32:03.286
Come on, let's go!

32:03.320 --> 32:09.125
Five, four, three, two, one,
and stop!

32:09.159 --> 32:10.793
Hands in the air!

32:10.828 --> 32:12.562
- Oh, my...
- Well done.

32:12.596 --> 32:14.497
Nice job, guys!

32:14.531 --> 32:16.432
Whoo!

32:16.467 --> 32:20.970
Service, please.

32:21.004 --> 32:22.738
He took the
one without the chip.

32:22.773 --> 32:25.274
It's okay, the rest
of our dish is still good.

32:25.309 --> 32:28.411
I'm really nervous right now
because we had so many issues

32:28.445 --> 32:29.712
with the plating,

32:29.746 --> 32:31.948
and right now,
there's nothing we can do.

32:31.982 --> 32:33.226
We just have to hope that
everything on our plate

32:33.250 --> 32:35.017
is really good.

32:35.052 --> 32:36.319
- Wow.
- How fancy.

32:36.353 --> 32:39.689
The presentation is gorgeous.
I love the colors.

32:39.723 --> 32:42.258
Be careful.
Make sure that they're flat.

32:42.292 --> 32:43.459
We did this.

32:43.493 --> 32:45.328
I'm pretty proud of the red team

32:45.362 --> 32:46.863
for what we accomplished.

32:46.897 --> 32:49.899
I mean, we did fall behind
but we did bring it back.

32:49.933 --> 32:51.934
<i>I just know
that we did our best.</i>

32:51.969 --> 32:53.069
Look at this.

32:53.103 --> 32:54.237
Beautiful.

32:54.271 --> 32:56.339
And these young kids made this?

32:56.373 --> 32:57.507
Wow.

32:57.541 --> 32:59.709
Red team, blue team, congrats!

32:59.743 --> 33:04.180
You just completed your first
full restaurant service.

33:04.214 --> 33:07.250
Now all you guys can do
is wait and hope

33:07.284 --> 33:10.353
that these most awesome
grandmothers

33:10.387 --> 33:11.754
think that your dish
is the best.

33:11.789 --> 33:14.090
Why don't you guys
go chill out on the patio?

33:14.124 --> 33:15.224
Off you go.

33:15.259 --> 33:17.160
- Let's go, guys.
- Good job, guys.

33:17.194 --> 33:20.530
I'm a little bit worried
because we ran out of pork,

33:20.564 --> 33:25.134
so we put two slices of pork
on each plate instead of three.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.503
A lot is on the line here,

33:27.538 --> 33:29.639
so I hope we're gonna be okay.

33:33.143 --> 33:35.144
Ladies.

33:37.247 --> 33:39.449
Uh, ladies, a very big thank you

33:39.483 --> 33:41.523
for being part of this
very special evening tonight.

33:41.552 --> 33:42.996
On behalf of Christina
and Graham and myself,

33:43.020 --> 33:44.387
it has been an absolute honor.

33:44.421 --> 33:47.490
All your dinners
have been conceived and executed

33:47.524 --> 33:51.661
by home cooks
aged 8 to 12 years of age.

33:51.695 --> 33:53.106
Now, a quick insight
into the dishes.

33:53.130 --> 33:54.407
The red team have
served you tonight

33:54.431 --> 33:57.967
a delicious, fragrant
mussel and clam bake.

33:58.001 --> 34:01.237
Served in the broth
of the bake, a cod cake.

34:01.271 --> 34:02.348
Underneath that,
of course you've got

34:02.372 --> 34:04.507
this beautiful roasted
corn on the cob,

34:04.541 --> 34:06.409
and then topped with celery.

34:06.443 --> 34:07.687
Now the blue team
have served you

34:07.711 --> 34:11.047
a delicious grilled,
then baked loin of pork

34:11.081 --> 34:12.681
that's been rubbed with spice,

34:12.716 --> 34:14.417
served with a bean cake,

34:14.451 --> 34:18.121
finished with a delicious,
light avocado <i> crema.</i>

34:18.155 --> 34:20.690
Now, after dinner tonight,

34:20.724 --> 34:23.826
you will decide
which dish you liked best.

34:23.860 --> 34:26.596
Please, on behalf of myself
and <i> MasterChef Junior,</i>

34:26.630 --> 34:27.897
bon appÃ©tit.
Thank you so much.

34:27.931 --> 34:31.333
- Ooh.
- How beautiful.

34:31.368 --> 34:33.112
Seeing all those grandmas
made me kind of, like,

34:33.137 --> 34:34.303
miss my grandma.

34:34.338 --> 34:37.273
Yeah, same.

34:37.306 --> 34:38.940
And the clams are great.

34:38.976 --> 34:41.043
Mm, and very tasty, isn't it?

34:41.078 --> 34:43.045
The bean cake is quite good.

34:43.080 --> 34:46.382
I thought it was salty.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.516
Yummy.

34:47.551 --> 34:50.719
I like this.

34:50.754 --> 34:51.721
Hi.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.022
Now, ladies.

34:53.056 --> 34:54.567
Welcome to the MasterChef Junior
restaurant.

34:54.591 --> 34:56.192
How is your clam bake?

34:56.226 --> 34:59.362
I loved it, especially the cake.

34:59.396 --> 35:01.597
- Oh, good, the cod cake?
- Yes.

35:01.632 --> 35:05.168
I liked the spice it had in it

35:05.202 --> 35:08.705
and the mussel was delicious.
It was huge.

35:08.739 --> 35:09.972
Beautiful.

35:10.007 --> 35:12.108
Let's talk about
the blue team's pork loin.

35:12.142 --> 35:15.244
It was tasty, but a little dry.

35:15.279 --> 35:16.890
Interesting. It's an absolute
pleasure, thank you.

35:16.914 --> 35:17.991
Thank you.
So much.

35:18.015 --> 35:19.649
What do guys think
is gonna happen?

35:19.683 --> 35:23.019
I think if our food tasted
as good as we thought it did,

35:23.053 --> 35:25.221
then we're definitely
gonna be up there.

35:25.255 --> 35:27.123
Tasty, huh?

35:27.157 --> 35:28.558
Now, Millie and Julie,

35:28.592 --> 35:29.636
welcome to
the MasterChef restaurant.

35:29.660 --> 35:30.760
Thank you.

35:30.794 --> 35:33.129
The food is so good.

35:33.163 --> 35:35.598
Gordon, I just have to say
that we all agree

35:35.632 --> 35:37.700
that you're much
more handsome in person.

35:37.735 --> 35:39.135
Flattery will get you nowhere.

35:40.370 --> 35:42.238
Now, you're enjoying
the clam bake?

35:42.272 --> 35:43.439
I am.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.241
I wish I had a spoon.
I'd drink the sauce.

35:45.275 --> 35:46.342
Oh, great.

35:46.377 --> 35:48.177
- It's too spicy for me.
- Too spicy?

35:48.212 --> 35:49.445
- The cod.
- The cod cake.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.546
That's interesting.

35:50.581 --> 35:51.547
Now the pork dish
from the blue team,

35:51.582 --> 35:52.648
how was that?

35:52.683 --> 35:53.950
Oh, I loved the pork.

35:53.984 --> 35:55.261
- Is this a bean cake?
- Yes, it is.

35:55.285 --> 35:56.596
- It's delicious.
- It is delicious.

35:56.620 --> 35:59.389
- Which one would you prefer?
- Probably the pork.

35:59.423 --> 36:01.357
- From the blue team.
- Yeah, the blue team.

36:01.392 --> 36:03.192
This was more complex thing
for them to do.

36:03.227 --> 36:05.194
- Yes.
- And they've done it well.

36:05.229 --> 36:06.229
Yes, thank you.

36:06.263 --> 36:07.430
Thank you.

36:07.464 --> 36:09.232
I think I'll have
to go with blue plate.

36:09.266 --> 36:11.401
But I am leaning
toward the red plate.

36:11.435 --> 36:13.503
Definitely the red.

36:19.710 --> 36:20.950
Red team, blue team, well done.

36:20.978 --> 36:24.213
For the first time ever,
you cooked for a restaurant

36:24.248 --> 36:26.949
full of VIGs,
Very Important Grannies.

36:26.984 --> 36:28.151
All of you, well done.

36:28.185 --> 36:30.620
Shall we find out the results?

36:30.654 --> 36:33.823
Yes, Chef!

36:33.857 --> 36:35.458
Gordon, I have the results.

36:35.492 --> 36:36.870
Please, thank you, Millie.
Come in, my darling.

36:36.894 --> 36:39.362
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

36:40.431 --> 36:41.431
- Aw!
- Good luck.

36:41.465 --> 36:42.742
Thank you, my darling.
Good night.

36:42.766 --> 36:43.833
Bye!

36:43.867 --> 36:47.103
- Hope you enjoyed your meal!
- Bye!

36:47.137 --> 36:51.574
I've heard that
it's a very close vote.

36:51.608 --> 36:53.009
Oh.

36:53.043 --> 36:55.111
I'm just praying it's us
because if I win this,

36:55.145 --> 36:57.346
I go straight into the top ten

36:57.381 --> 36:59.348
and that's huge!

36:59.383 --> 37:03.486
The team that the
grandmothers chose...

37:03.520 --> 37:06.889
Every grandmother loves me
so the red team has to win this!

37:06.924 --> 37:08.558
Oh, my God.

37:08.592 --> 37:11.995
Tonight's winning team is...

37:12.029 --> 37:13.896
Congratulations...

37:18.778 --> 37:21.580
Okay, red team, blue team,
well done, all of you.

37:21.614 --> 37:23.448
The results are now in.

37:23.483 --> 37:26.952
The team that
the grandmothers chose

37:26.986 --> 37:29.888
and the team
that will get propelled

37:29.922 --> 37:33.358
straight into the top ten is...

37:37.930 --> 37:39.397
Blue team!

37:41.067 --> 37:42.801
Oh, my God!

37:42.835 --> 37:44.369
Oh, my gosh!

37:44.403 --> 37:46.238
The blue team won!

37:46.272 --> 37:47.706
I just can't even believe it.

37:47.740 --> 37:49.975
Blue team, head up
to the balcony please.

37:50.009 --> 37:51.643
Good job.

37:51.677 --> 37:53.912
I'm in the top ten!

37:53.946 --> 37:59.818
This is like winning 1 million
softball championships in one.

37:59.852 --> 38:02.120
Red team,

38:02.155 --> 38:06.425
sadly we have to say good-bye
to two of you tonight,

38:06.459 --> 38:09.895
but first the good news.

38:09.929 --> 38:12.664
There were two of you
that really didn't deserve

38:12.698 --> 38:15.000
to be on
the losing team tonight.

38:15.034 --> 38:18.537
Two of you really gave
everything you had.

38:20.706 --> 38:23.542
Please step forward...

38:23.576 --> 38:26.978
Sam and Avery.

38:28.581 --> 38:29.948
Congratulations, you are through

38:29.982 --> 38:33.318
to the top ten
of MasterChef Junior.

38:33.352 --> 38:35.187
Head on up to the balcony.

38:44.931 --> 38:47.966
Kya, Jesse, Ian, and Corey.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.103
You four have been amazing,.
Let's get that right.

38:51.137 --> 38:54.606
But the team performance
tonight,

38:54.640 --> 38:59.511
unfortunately, all four of you
were somewhat fragmented.

38:59.545 --> 39:00.789
Being in the bottom feels scary

39:00.813 --> 39:03.382
'cause this is only
my first time.

39:03.416 --> 39:05.250
I'm standing up here
with all my friends.

39:05.284 --> 39:08.487
I don't want any of us
to go home tonight.

39:08.521 --> 39:12.424
Two of you, I do believe
you have gone as far as you can

39:12.458 --> 39:16.728
in this competition.

39:16.763 --> 39:21.266
Jesse and Ian, tonight...

39:24.400 --> 39:26.505
Is the end of your journey

39:26.539 --> 39:27.939
in the MasterChef kitchen.

39:30.843 --> 39:33.912
Kya and Corey, say good-bye
to Jesse and Ian, please,

39:33.946 --> 39:35.213
and both of you head upstairs.

39:35.248 --> 39:37.549
I hope you win.

39:37.583 --> 39:38.784
Keep smiling, okay?

39:44.057 --> 39:47.492
Jesse, you have been incredible

39:47.527 --> 39:48.860
across this competition.

39:48.895 --> 39:51.830
To us, you've done nothing
but shine.

39:51.864 --> 39:55.434
Ian, your attitude
and your energy

39:55.468 --> 39:57.769
has been phenomenal.

39:57.804 --> 40:00.205
Keeping your MasterChef
white aprons,

40:00.239 --> 40:03.041
you now have bragging rights
for the rest of your lives.

40:03.076 --> 40:04.910
Yes, Chef.

40:04.944 --> 40:07.145
Both of you, come up here
and say good-bye, please.

40:10.049 --> 40:11.783
Take care, my man.
All right, good luck.

40:11.818 --> 40:15.821
Come here, bud, huh?
Oh, man, ah?

40:15.855 --> 40:18.390
Guys, thank you, best wishes.
Take care, good night.

40:18.424 --> 40:21.126
Great job, guys.

40:21.160 --> 40:23.562
I'm pretty sad that
I'm leaving right now.

40:23.596 --> 40:25.797
I'm eight years old
and I was the youngest boy

40:25.832 --> 40:27.232
in this competition.

40:27.266 --> 40:28.767
Avery!

40:28.801 --> 40:31.236
I am just so proud of myself
for making it this far.

40:31.270 --> 40:32.938
Yeah, baby!
Whoo-hoo!

40:32.972 --> 40:34.773
I'm really sad
that I'm going home tonight,

40:34.807 --> 40:37.876
but this was the best experience
I've ever had in my life.

40:37.910 --> 40:39.945
Strawberry power!

40:44.417 --> 40:46.618
Cooking for Gordon Ramsay,

40:46.652 --> 40:50.255
Christina Tosi,
and Graham Elliot was so cool.

40:50.289 --> 40:51.700
You got a great sear
on the scallops.

40:51.724 --> 40:53.369
It looks like something
out of a cool gastropub.

40:53.393 --> 40:54.493
Thank you.

40:54.527 --> 40:56.762
None of my classmates
can say that.

40:56.796 --> 40:59.765
It's perfectly golden brown
on the outside

40:59.799 --> 41:01.300
and doughy in the center.

41:01.334 --> 41:02.868
- These are amazing.
- Thanks.

41:02.902 --> 41:05.871
I'm happy I came
into the MasterChef kitchen,

41:05.905 --> 41:08.774
because now I know how
to fillet a fish.

41:08.808 --> 41:10.442
I know how to make
croquembouche.

41:10.476 --> 41:13.245
I know so much more
than I knew before.

41:13.279 --> 41:15.447
Bye, guys!
You did great!

41:15.481 --> 41:17.316
In my past eight
years on this planet,

41:17.350 --> 41:20.919
by far this was the best time.

41:20.953 --> 41:22.054
Bye!

41:27.493 --> 41:28.560
Next week...

41:28.594 --> 41:31.930
Bawk-bawk, baby!
It's chicken time!

41:31.964 --> 41:34.833
It's an
egg-splosive team challenge...

41:34.867 --> 41:36.735
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Yeah.

41:36.769 --> 41:37.836
With a twist.

41:37.870 --> 41:39.404
There is another team.

41:39.439 --> 41:41.306
That leaves
the junior home cooks...

41:41.341 --> 41:43.241
Graham Elliot and Gordon Ramsay.

41:43.276 --> 41:44.443
Shell-shocked.

41:44.477 --> 41:45.544
We gotta chop the chives!

41:45.578 --> 41:46.645
Three!

41:46.679 --> 41:48.280
Two of the best chefs
in the world.

41:48.314 --> 41:49.348
Two!

41:49.382 --> 41:50.749
Get it, get it, get it!

41:50.783 --> 41:52.561
How the heck are
the kids gonna win this?

41:52.585 --> 41:53.719
One!

41:53.753 --> 41:56.354
- Dude!
- What are they doing?
