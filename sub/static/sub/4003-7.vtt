- WELL, LET'S ALL WELCOME BACK
DETECTIVE FUCKIN' MORGAN.

11:17.542 --> 11:21.000
[applause]

11:21.000 --> 11:23.125
- I WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK
SERGEANT BATISTA

11:23.125 --> 11:25.000
TO UPDATE US ON HIS CASE.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.834
- BASED ON THE FINGERPRINTS,
WE'VE I.D.'D THE VICTIM

11:28.834 --> 11:32.667
AS ESTRELLA CARAZO--
19 YEARS OLD.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.917
SHE IS A CITIZEN
OF NICARAGUA,

11:34.917 --> 11:37.125
HERE ON AN EXPIRED VISA.

11:37.125 --> 11:38.667
UH, THE M.E. ESTIMATES
THAT THE ARM

11:38.667 --> 11:41.000
WAS INGESTED LESS THAN
72 HOURS AGO

11:41.000 --> 11:45.500
AND THE TIME OF DEATH LESS THAN
24 HOURS PRIOR TO THAT.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.333
- SHE WORKED
AS A COCKTAIL WAITRESS

11:47.333 --> 11:48.667
AT THE BAYSIDE CLUB.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.542
BUT SHE ALSO
DID SOME MODELING.

11:50.542 --> 11:52.208
- YEAH, SHE HAD A JOB SCHEDULED
FOUR DAYS AGO

11:52.208 --> 11:54.542
WITH A PHOTOGRAPHER NAMED
JONATHAN FARROW.

11:54.542 --> 11:58.583
- HE'S A VERY BIG
FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER.

11:58.583 --> 12:01.750
- THAT'S DISGUSTING.
- WHAT THE FUCK...?

12:01.750 --> 12:03.709
- THAT IS SICK.

12:03.709 --> 12:07.417
- EVEN I'M DISTURBED BY THIS.

12:07.417 --> 12:09.250
- MS. CARAZO DIDN'T REPORT
FOR WORK

12:09.250 --> 12:10.959
THE NIGHT AFTER SHE WAS
SCHEDULED TO SEE FARROW.

12:10.959 --> 12:13.083
THE KICKER IS, SEVEN YEARS AGO
FARROW WAS ARRESTED

12:13.083 --> 12:14.709
IN NEW YORK
ON SUSPICION OF RAPE.

12:14.709 --> 12:16.500
THE CHARGES
WERE ULTIMATELY DROPPED.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.583
- SO HE'S CLEAN?

12:18.583 --> 12:19.834
- WHEN I SPOKE WITH THE
LEAD DETECTIVE OF THAT CASE,

12:19.834 --> 12:21.750
UH, HE THINKS THE VICTIM
WAS PAID OFF.

12:21.750 --> 12:24.041
- OKAY, SO HE'S DIRTY.

12:24.041 --> 12:25.750
- THE GUY'S SURROUNDED
BY A FIREWALL OF LAWYERS.

12:25.750 --> 12:27.667
- HE'S WELL PROTECTED
AND PLAYING HARDBALL.

12:27.667 --> 12:29.583
- MAYBE I'LL GET A TURN
AT BAT.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.792
- WELL, HE'S AGREED TO COME IN
FOR QUESTIONING THIS MORNING

12:31.792 --> 12:33.959
BUT I DOUBT IF WE'LL GET
ANYTHING OUT OF HIM.

12:33.959 --> 12:35.750
- I'D LIKE TO BE THERE.
- OKAY.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.250
- WELL THANK YOU, ANG--
SGT. BATISTA.

12:37.250 --> 12:38.125
EXCUSE ME.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.750
- YOU'RE WELCOME, LIEUTENANT.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.583
- WHAT'S WITH BATISTA
AND LAGUERTA?

12:47.583 --> 12:49.125
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:49.125 --> 12:50.959
- THEY'RE AFRAID
TO LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

12:50.959 --> 12:52.583
- WHY WOULD THAT BE?

12:52.583 --> 12:54.500
- BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING IT?

12:54.500 --> 12:56.000
- MAKES SENSE.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.083
WHEN YOU PUT TWO PEOPLE
IN A ROOM TOGETHER LONG ENOUGH

12:59.083 --> 13:00.041
EVENTUALLY THEY'RE GONNA FUCK.

13:00.041 --> 13:03.166
- OH, WOW.
THAT'S SO ROMANTIC.

13:03.166 --> 13:06.041
YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT TATTOOED
ACROSS YOUR FAT HEAD.

13:06.041 --> 13:07.250
- WHAT?

13:08.750 --> 13:12.375
- I'LL NEED TO FIND THE RIGHT
ACTIVITY FOR ASTOR.

13:12.375 --> 13:16.333
WHAT DID I LIKE TO DO
WHEN I WAS 12?

13:16.333 --> 13:18.792
OKAY, THEN, MOVING ON.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.875
- HI, THIS IS MR. FARROW'S
ASSISTANT, HOLD PLEASE.

13:34.875 --> 13:38.250
UH, NO, I'M SORRY.
MR. FARROW IS NOT AVAILABLE

13:38.250 --> 13:39.750
FOR ANY BOOKINGS RIGHT NOW.

13:45.083 --> 13:46.834
- YOU HAVE
NOTHING BETTER TO DO?

13:46.834 --> 13:48.625
- I WOULDN'T SAY
FARROW'S NOTHING.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.625
- COMPARED TO TRINITY,
HE IS.

13:50.625 --> 13:53.792
- TRINITY'S NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.375
WITH HIS KILL CYCLE OVER

13:55.375 --> 13:57.500
HE'S NOT A THREAT TO ANYONE
FOR THE TIME BEING.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.083
NOT SURE I COULD SAY THE SAME
ABOUT THIS GUY.

14:00.083 --> 14:03.834
- I HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA
WHO ESTRELLA CARAZO IS.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.250
OH, YES.

14:09.250 --> 14:11.417
GOD, SHE HAD A NICE ASS.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.166
I SHOT HER IN MY STUDIO
LAST THURSDAY

14:13.166 --> 14:15.000
FOR A JAMAICAN RUM CAMPAIGN.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.542
NOTHING SELLS RUM
LIKE A NICE BOOTY.

14:17.542 --> 14:18.667
- WHAT TIME WAS THAT?

14:18.667 --> 14:22.333
- UH, 9:00 A.M.
TILL NOON.

14:22.333 --> 14:23.667
YEAH, THEN I DROVE DOWN
TO THE KEYS

14:23.667 --> 14:24.792
FOR ANOTHER COMMERCIAL SHOOT

14:24.792 --> 14:26.333
THAT LASTED WELL
INTO THE NIGHT.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.917
- THAT CAN BE VERIFIED?

14:27.917 --> 14:31.500
- BY MY ASSISTANT AND ABOUT
A DOZEN OTHER PEOPLE.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.125
- TELL ME, DEXTER,

14:33.125 --> 14:34.834
WHAT'S THE REAL REASON
YOU'RE STALLING

14:34.834 --> 14:37.000
ON KILLING TRINITY?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.542
- I STILL HAVE THINGS
TO LEARN FROM HIM.

14:38.542 --> 14:41.375
- I SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE
TRYING TO TEACH YOU

14:41.375 --> 14:42.542
NOT TO BE LIKE HIM.

14:42.542 --> 14:44.458
- YOU ALSO TAUGHT ME

14:44.458 --> 14:46.959
I COULDN'T BE WITH PEOPLE,
I COULDN'T GET MARRIED.

14:46.959 --> 14:49.375
YOU TAUGHT ME A LOT OF THINGS
I LEARNED WERE WRONG.

14:49.375 --> 14:51.750
- YOU'RE TAKING A RISK HERE.

14:51.750 --> 14:54.917
- ISN'T THAT WHAT LIFE IS?

14:54.917 --> 14:57.208
A RISK?

14:57.208 --> 14:59.583
- ANY IDEAS WHO MIGHT HAVE
WANTED TO HARM MISS CARAZO?

14:59.583 --> 15:04.041
- LOOK, THE GIRL WAS GORGEOUS
BUT SHE WAS F.O.J.J.

15:04.041 --> 15:06.208
- F.O.J.J.?

15:06.208 --> 15:10.083
- FRESH OFF THE JUMBO JET.
YEAH.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.542
VERY RURAL, YOU MIGHT SAY.

15:12.542 --> 15:14.333
- SENSITIVE GUY...

15:14.333 --> 15:15.583
- I LIKE YOU.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.834
I COULD MAKE YOU A STAR.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.458
I JUST NEED TO GET YOU
IN MY STUDIO

15:20.458 --> 15:25.083
WHIP YOUR CLOTHES OFF
AND ROUGH YOU UP A LITTLE BIT.

15:25.083 --> 15:28.291
- I THINK YOU JUST JUMPED
TO THE TOP OF MY LIST.

15:31.917 --> 15:33.750
- IT'S GONNA BE SO NICE

15:33.750 --> 15:36.125
TO FINALLY HAVE MY OWN
PLACE AGAIN.

15:43.709 --> 15:44.792
- NICE APARTMENT.

15:44.792 --> 15:46.417
- YEAH, RIGHT?

15:46.417 --> 15:48.375
I'VE WANTED IT FOR YEARS.

15:48.375 --> 15:49.792
- WHO'S WAS IT?

15:49.792 --> 15:52.750
- DEXTER'S.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.917
- NO SHIT?

15:54.917 --> 15:56.250
HOW COME YOU'RE JUST NOW
GETTING IT?

15:56.250 --> 15:58.250
I MEAN, HE GOT MARRIED,
LIKE WHAT, EIGHT MONTHS AGO?

15:58.250 --> 16:01.000
- WELL, HE KIND OF HELD ON TO IT
FOR A WHILE.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.458
- FOR WHAT,
LIKE HIS SECRET FUCKPAD?

16:02.458 --> 16:06.208
- NO I THINK HE JUST
HAS A PROBLEM WITH CHANGE.

16:06.208 --> 16:07.792
HE'S VERY SLOW TO EVOLVE.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.750
- ANYWAY, I SHOULD BE GOING.

16:10.750 --> 16:11.959
- YEAH, THANKS FOR THE HELP.

16:11.959 --> 16:14.083
I'M NOT SUPPOSE TO LIFT
ANYTHING FOR A WHILE.

16:19.208 --> 16:22.083
- YOU KEPT YOUR APARTMENT
AFTER YOU GOT MARRIED?

16:22.083 --> 16:25.125
WHAT KIND OF GUY DOES THAT?

16:25.125 --> 16:27.583
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING, DEXTER?

16:27.583 --> 16:29.417
- STAY OUT OF MY LIFE.

16:34.959 --> 16:36.875
I KNOW THIS IS, LIKE,
YOUR PLACE NOW

16:36.875 --> 16:39.750
BUT ARE YOU
ALWAYS GONNA, LIKE,

16:39.750 --> 16:41.333
HAVE PEOPLE HERE?

16:41.333 --> 16:43.792
- YES, DEX, SOMETIMES
I'M GONNA HAVE PEOPLE OVER.

16:50.834 --> 16:53.375
- THIS IS, UH, THE REST
OF YOUR STUFF FROM THE HOUSE.

16:53.375 --> 16:57.500
- THANKS.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.458
I'M PICKING UP RIGHT WHERE
LUNDY LEFT OFF WITH TRINITY.

17:00.458 --> 17:02.875
I OWE HIM THAT MUCH, RIGHT?

17:02.875 --> 17:05.125
SO LOOK...

17:05.125 --> 17:09.083
THERE ARE OVER 60 DEATHS
LINKED TO TRINITY.

17:09.083 --> 17:13.333
12 DIFFERENT CITIES,
CASES LEADING BACK TO 1979.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.500
I HAVE EVERY LITTLE IOTA
OF EVIDENCE FRANK COLLECTED

17:16.500 --> 17:19.709
EXCEPT WHAT WAS STOLEN
BY TRINITY.

17:19.709 --> 17:21.125
AND I'M GONNA RUN IT ALL BY
LAGUERTA TOMORROW

17:21.125 --> 17:22.834
WITH THE KICKER...

17:22.834 --> 17:28.250
THAT TRINITY SHOT ME
AND LUNDY TOO.

17:28.250 --> 17:31.417
- WOW, THAT'S A LOT.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.834
- FUCK YEAH, IT'S A LOT.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.208
- DEB'S RIGHT
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE

17:35.208 --> 17:37.417
SOME MAD CONSPIRACY THEORY.

17:37.417 --> 17:38.709
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT LAGUERTA WILL THINK

17:38.709 --> 17:39.875
WHEN SHE HEARS IT.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.375
- I'M GONNA FUCKIN'
BLOW HER AWAY.

17:44.542 --> 17:46.375
- ARE THESE--

17:46.375 --> 17:48.917
- THEY'RE DAD'S OLD
C.I. FILES.

17:52.542 --> 17:57.709
- DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD THEM.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.417
- SO YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME
HOW IT'S GOING--

17:59.417 --> 18:01.625
YOUR SEARCH.

18:01.625 --> 18:03.041
- I FINALLY GOT SOME REAL INFO

18:03.041 --> 18:04.250
ON WHO DAD MIGHT
HAVE BEEN SEEING.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.709
- MY MOTHER, YOU MEAN?

18:05.709 --> 18:06.917
- I'M HAVING COFFEE
WITH HER TOMORROW.

18:06.917 --> 18:08.709
- OKAY, NOW I'M CONFUSED.

18:08.709 --> 18:09.917
COFFEE?

18:09.917 --> 18:11.250
- HER NAME'S VALERIE HODGES.

18:11.250 --> 18:12.959
I LEFT A MESSAGE FOR HER,
LIKE, A MONTH AGO,

18:12.959 --> 18:14.709
AND SHE FINALLY
CALLED ME BACK.

18:14.709 --> 18:16.291
- NOT MY MOTHER.

18:16.291 --> 18:18.458
DEBRA'S HEADED
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

18:18.458 --> 18:21.250
BUT WHEN SHE REALIZES THAT
AND GETS HEADED THE RIGHT WAY--

18:21.250 --> 18:23.583
LAURA MOSER LEADS
TO BRIAN MOSER,

18:23.583 --> 18:26.875
LEADS TO THE ICE TRUCK KILLER,
LEADS TO HARRY MORGAN.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.750
SO MANY LITTLE STEPPING STONES

18:28.750 --> 18:31.834
THAT LAY A PATH DIRECTLY
TO THE REAL ME.

18:31.834 --> 18:34.542
LET ME KNOW HOW IT GOES.

18:34.542 --> 18:36.417
- I WILL.

18:40.375 --> 18:42.375
- HI, DEXTER.

18:42.375 --> 18:43.417
- HI, DEXTER.
- HEY.

18:43.417 --> 18:44.542
- HEY, SWEETIE.

18:44.542 --> 18:45.792
- HEY, BUDDY.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.250
TOUGH DAY?

18:48.250 --> 18:52.291
- ELLIOT'S GIRLFRIEND
MOVED OUT THIS AFTERNOON.

18:52.291 --> 18:53.709
- OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

18:53.709 --> 18:55.458
- WHAT'S TOO BAD?

18:55.458 --> 18:58.250
- WHAT'S TOO BAD IS...

18:58.250 --> 19:00.291
THAT I FOUND ALL THIS FUN STUFF
FOR KIDS TO DO TODAY

19:00.291 --> 19:03.500
AND I CAN'T DO ANY OF IT
'CAUSE I'M TOO BIG.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.583
- LIKE WHAT?

19:04.583 --> 19:06.375
- WELL, FOR CODY,

19:06.375 --> 19:09.583
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT LIKE
TO JOIN THE YOUNG SAILORS CLUB.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.125
- YEAH!

19:11.125 --> 19:12.458
- WOW, THAT'S GREAT.

19:12.458 --> 19:14.083
ELLIOT'S SON
DANNY'S IN THAT.

19:14.083 --> 19:15.500
I THINK THEY HAVE AN OUTING
THIS WEEKEND?

19:15.500 --> 19:16.834
- I WANNA SAIL.

19:16.834 --> 19:19.250
- THEN SAIL YOU SHALL.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.083
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

19:21.083 --> 19:23.166
- HOW DOES SOCCER GRAB YOU?

19:23.166 --> 19:25.542
YOU GET TO KICK THINGS.

19:25.542 --> 19:27.291
- NO, THANKS.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.458
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT BALLET?

19:29.458 --> 19:30.625
- YUCK.

19:30.625 --> 19:32.834
- OKAY.

19:32.834 --> 19:35.083
HOW ABOUT THE
LITTLE SCIENTISTS ASSOCIATION?

19:35.083 --> 19:37.458
- WHY DO YOU
HATE ME SO MUCH?

19:41.083 --> 19:42.667
- WE'LL KEEP
WORKING ON ASTOR.

19:42.667 --> 19:43.917
BUT THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

19:43.917 --> 19:46.417
HOW DID YOU DECIDE
TO DO ALL THIS?

19:46.417 --> 19:49.125
- WELL, I FEEL IT'S MY
RESPONSIBILITY AS THEIR FATHER

19:49.125 --> 19:52.333
TO HELP PUSH THE KIDS
OUT INTO THE WORLD.

19:52.333 --> 19:55.291
MAKE THEM PREPARED
AND SELF-SUFFICIENT.

19:55.291 --> 19:57.041
- I'M IMPRESSED.

19:57.041 --> 19:58.166
DINNER'S ALMOST READY.

19:58.166 --> 20:01.125
- GOOD, I'VE GOT
AN EARLY-MORNING MEETING.

20:16.709 --> 20:20.291
OKAY, TWO SERIAL KILLERS
GO FOR A RIDE...

20:20.291 --> 20:22.166
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING
THIS JOKE ENDS

20:22.166 --> 20:24.375
WITH ONLY ONE OF THEM
COMING BACK?

20:30.542 --> 20:32.917
I'VE BARELY SKIMMED
THE SURFACE

20:32.917 --> 20:35.583
OF ARTHUR MITCHELL.

20:35.583 --> 20:38.625
STILL SO MUCH TO LEARN
ABOUT HANDLING THE KIDS.

20:38.625 --> 20:42.041
THE WIFE...

20:42.041 --> 20:45.625
- CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON.

20:45.625 --> 20:48.250
- OR MAYBE NOT.

20:48.250 --> 20:51.834
I HAVE PLENTY OF EXPERIENCE
WITH THE CHAINSAW.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.917
BUT IT'S HEAVY,
DIFFICULT TO WIELD,

20:53.917 --> 20:55.041
HAS A SHORT REACH.

20:55.041 --> 20:57.083
UM, AXE.

21:16.792 --> 21:20.834
THIS IS A LITTLE TOO
INTO THE WOODS FOR ME.

21:20.834 --> 21:22.834
SO WHAT IS IT
WE'RE DOING OUT HERE?

21:22.834 --> 21:24.417
- WE'RE GONNA
CUT DOWN A TREE.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.959
- OH.

21:42.625 --> 21:45.959
- GOD DAMN IT!

21:45.959 --> 21:47.625
- WANT ME TO GIVE IT A TRY?

22:33.500 --> 22:35.125
STAND BACK.

22:48.125 --> 22:51.959
SO ABOUT THE KIDS,

22:51.959 --> 22:54.250
UH, ONE OF THEM
DOESN'T WANNA DO

22:54.250 --> 22:55.834
ANY OF THE THINGS
I SUGGESTED.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.917
- SO DON'T MAKE THEM
SUGGESTIONS.

22:57.917 --> 23:00.542
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:00.542 --> 23:02.000
- THEY'RE JUST CHILDREN, KYLE.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.667
IF YOU LET THEM DO WHATEVER
THEY WANT,

23:03.667 --> 23:06.041
THEY'D SUCK THEIR THUMBS
AND DIDDLE THEMSELVES ALL DAY.

23:11.667 --> 23:12.750
- SO WHY DID
WE COME OUT HERE

23:12.750 --> 23:15.375
INSTEAD OF JUST
GO TO THE HARDWARE STORE?

23:15.375 --> 23:17.458
- I DON'T WANT THE LUMBER
IN THE HARDWARE STORE.

23:17.458 --> 23:18.750
- THIS IS BETTER--

23:18.750 --> 23:20.291
- YEAH, IT'S BETTER.

23:20.291 --> 23:25.166
- OKAY, ARTHUR,
YOU'RE A BIT OFF TODAY.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.542
- UH...

23:46.542 --> 23:48.250
- KYLE,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HIT IT.

23:48.250 --> 23:51.291
- [groans]

23:51.291 --> 23:53.750
- OF COURSE NOT.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

23:53.750 --> 23:56.375
- HUH, WE SHOULD GO.

23:56.375 --> 24:00.583
- IT'S GONNA DIE.
IT'S SUFFERING.

24:00.583 --> 24:03.125
IT NEEDS TO BE PUT
OUT OF ITS MISERY, ARTHUR.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.083
YOU NEED TO KILL IT.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.959
- NO, I--I CAN'T.

24:16.959 --> 24:20.375
- HE SPENT HIS LIFE
KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE,

24:20.375 --> 24:22.458
BUT HE CAN'T KILL BAMBI?

24:22.458 --> 24:27.125
THIS IS YOUR
NEW ROLE MODEL, DEX?

24:27.125 --> 24:28.792
- IT'S IN PAIN, ARTHUR.

24:28.792 --> 24:32.959
- PLEASE, I CAN'T.

24:32.959 --> 24:34.458
- GET THAT AXE FROM HIM.

24:34.458 --> 24:39.291
KILL HIM NOW.

24:39.291 --> 24:44.125
- WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO KILL IT?

24:44.125 --> 24:45.250
- WOULD YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

24:53.250 --> 24:55.750
- NOW, DEXTER.
KILL ARTHUR, NOW.

25:14.166 --> 25:19.083
- MAN, EARLY MORNINGS
WITH TRINITY CAN BE MURDER.

25:19.083 --> 25:21.250
- LIEUTENANT?

25:21.250 --> 25:22.875
THE JUDGE WON'T ISSUE
A SEARCH WARRANT

25:22.875 --> 25:23.875
ON FARROW'S STUDIO.

25:23.875 --> 25:25.709
- NO PROBABLE CAUSE.

25:25.709 --> 25:27.000
- WELL, THAT'S BAD NEWS.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.417
- VERY, CAUSE I'M STILL SURE
HE'S OUR GUY.

25:28.417 --> 25:31.000
- I THINK THIS MEANS
HE'S MY GUY.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.166
- AND THIS CASE MAY BE BIGGER

25:32.166 --> 25:33.333
THAN WHAT
WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

25:33.333 --> 25:35.250
I'VE GOT THE NAMES
OF AT LEAST THREE MODELS

25:35.250 --> 25:37.583
FROM CENTRAL
AND SOUTH AMERICA

25:37.583 --> 25:39.166
WHO HAVE ALL GONE MISSING
OVER THE PAST YEAR.

25:39.166 --> 25:40.750
- ALL HERE ILLEGALLY.

25:40.750 --> 25:42.166
- NOW WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST
ONE OF THEM

25:42.166 --> 25:43.500
WORKED FOR FARROW.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.250
I FIGURE HE PICKS
HIS VICTIMS

25:45.250 --> 25:47.291
KNOWING THAT ONCE
THEY'VE DISAPPEARED,

25:47.291 --> 25:48.542
THEIR FAMILIES HAVE NO WAY

25:48.542 --> 25:49.709
OF GETTING
AN INVESTIGATION STARTED.

25:49.709 --> 25:52.083
AND I CAN'T GET A SEARCH WARRANT
ON THIS COME MIERDA.

25:52.083 --> 25:54.333
- FORTUNATELY,
UNLIKE BATISTA,

25:54.333 --> 25:55.583
I DON'T NEED A SEARCH WARRANT.

25:55.583 --> 25:57.667
- KEEP WORKING IT.
FIND ANOTHER WAY IN.

26:04.834 --> 26:07.208
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

26:07.208 --> 26:08.625
OFF THE RECORD.

26:08.625 --> 26:10.542
- GO FOR IT.

26:10.542 --> 26:12.458
- IS IT TRUE
THAT YOU AND BATISTA

26:12.458 --> 26:14.417
ARE IN SOME KIND
OF RELATIONSHIP?

26:14.417 --> 26:18.417
- EXCUSE ME, DETECTIVE?

26:18.417 --> 26:20.208
- IT'S JUST THAT
THERE'S A RUMOR GOING AROUND--

26:20.208 --> 26:22.333
- THEN PLEASE STOP
SPREADING IT.

26:22.333 --> 26:24.709
AS A FELLOW WOMAN IN
THE LARGELY MALE WORK FORCE,

26:24.709 --> 26:26.208
I'D THINK YOU'D HAVE A LITTLE
MORE SENSITIVITY

26:26.208 --> 26:28.333
TO THIS KIND OF SITUATION.

26:28.333 --> 26:32.542
SGT. BATISTA AND I
ARE CO-WORKERS AND FRIENDS.

26:34.834 --> 26:38.125
- SHIT.

26:38.125 --> 26:40.250
- FARROW HAS A REPUTATION
FOR PARTYING

26:40.250 --> 26:43.417
LATE INTO THE NIGHT.

26:43.417 --> 26:45.709
AND TONIGHT SHOULD BE
NO DIFFERENT.

26:54.333 --> 26:58.166
FARROW'S TRUSTY ASSISTANT
CLOSING UP SHOP.

26:58.166 --> 27:00.125
RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

28:11.125 --> 28:13.125
ESTRELLA CARAZO,

28:13.125 --> 28:15.625
ARE THOSE TEARS FOR REAL?

28:36.083 --> 28:38.750
I KNOW YOU LIKE
TO CREATE IMAGES OF VIOLENCE,

28:38.750 --> 28:40.583
BUT THIS ISN'T FAKE BLOOD
I'M SEEING.

28:40.583 --> 28:42.875
SOMEONE WAS HIT RIGHT HERE...

28:46.959 --> 28:48.375
MANAGED TO MAKE IT THIS FAR

28:48.375 --> 28:53.375
BEFORE SHE WAS...

28:53.375 --> 28:57.333
HIT AGAIN.

28:57.333 --> 29:00.333
AND THEN HERE...

29:04.917 --> 29:07.500
A FINGERNAIL.

29:18.083 --> 29:21.166
NOT EXACTLY CINDERELLA'S
GLASS SLIPPER.

29:21.166 --> 29:22.917
BUT IT IS A FIT.

29:52.083 --> 29:54.166
- VALERIE?
- THAT WOULD BE ME.

29:54.166 --> 29:55.750
- DEBRA MORGAN.
- I FIGURED.

29:55.750 --> 29:56.625
SIT DOWN.

29:56.625 --> 29:57.792
- I LEFT YOU MESSAGES
WEEKS AGO.

29:57.792 --> 29:59.208
I FIGURED YOU
WEREN'T GONNA CALL.

29:59.208 --> 30:01.291
- WELL, I WAS ON A CRUISE.

30:01.291 --> 30:04.125
RICH OLD MEN LOVE
TO SPEND MONEY ON ME.

30:04.125 --> 30:08.750
- UM, SO YOU USE TO WORK
FOR MY DAD, HARRY MORGAN?

30:08.750 --> 30:09.667
- I DID.

30:09.667 --> 30:11.625
I STILL HAVE MY SOURCES,

30:11.625 --> 30:13.000
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE WONDERING.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.583
PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

30:14.583 --> 30:17.291
OF COURSE, MY FEE'S GONNA BE
A LITTLE HIGHER NOW.

30:17.291 --> 30:20.917
- NO, ACTUALLY, I JUST WANTED
TO ASK YOU ABOUT MY DAD.

30:22.500 --> 30:26.125
DID YOU AND MY FATHER...

30:26.125 --> 30:30.750
DID YOU EVER
HAVE A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP?

30:30.750 --> 30:32.792
- OH, UM,

30:32.792 --> 30:37.125
I'M NOT SURE
ROMANTIC IS THE RIGHT WORD.

30:37.125 --> 30:38.667
I WAS ONE OF HIS GIRLFRIENDS,

30:38.667 --> 30:41.375
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

30:41.375 --> 30:43.500
- THERE WERE OTHERS?

30:43.500 --> 30:45.709
I THINK HE PICKED THE C.I.s

30:45.709 --> 30:51.250
BASED ON HOW GOOD WE WERE
IN THE SACK.

30:51.250 --> 30:55.166
- I'M SORRY--THAT'S JUST...

30:55.166 --> 30:57.834
THAT'S JUST NOT THE PICTURE
I HAVE OF MY DAD.

30:57.834 --> 30:59.250
- OH...

30:59.250 --> 31:03.083
HEY, I KNEW HE WAS A HOUND
WHEN I MET HIM,

31:03.083 --> 31:05.792
WE ALL DID.

31:05.792 --> 31:07.500
I WAS ONE
OF HIS FAVORITES THOUGH.

31:07.500 --> 31:11.333
I USE TO DRIVE HIM CRAZY
WITH THIS ONE THING--

31:11.333 --> 31:14.625
- THAT'S ENOUGH--
THAT'S ENOUGH.

31:14.625 --> 31:15.875
THANK YOU.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.291
THANKS.

31:17.291 --> 31:20.750
- DOES THIS MEAN
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HIRE ME?

31:24.083 --> 31:26.375
- I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED
TO EVERYBODY.

31:26.375 --> 31:28.291
IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE
TO LOOK INTO DAD'S PAST.

31:28.291 --> 31:29.291
- WHAT HAPPENED?

31:29.291 --> 31:30.834
- IT'S TOO MUCH.

31:30.834 --> 31:32.500
I DON'T NEED
TO KNOW ALL THIS STUFF.

31:32.500 --> 31:33.792
- WHAT STUFF?

31:33.792 --> 31:36.583
- DAD WAS FUCKING
VALERIE HODGES.

31:36.583 --> 31:38.834
- REALLY?

31:38.834 --> 31:41.667
- BUT APPARENTLY
SHE WAS JUST ONE OF MANY.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.875
- IT'S EVERY
FATHER'S NIGHTMARE...

31:43.875 --> 31:45.375
DISAPPOINTING HIS CHILDREN.

31:45.375 --> 31:47.542
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE HARRY.

31:47.542 --> 31:48.875
- THANK YOU, DEX.

31:48.875 --> 31:51.542
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO HARRY IS ANYMORE.

31:51.542 --> 31:55.375
- HE'S STILL EVERYTHING
YOU REMEMBER HIM TO BE.

31:55.375 --> 31:57.709
- IS HE?

31:57.709 --> 32:00.875
- WE ALL HAVE SECRETS, DEB.

32:00.875 --> 32:04.500
SOME OF THEM
SHOULDN'T BE FOUND OUT.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.208
- I DON'T HAVE ANY SECRETS
LIKE THAT.

32:10.583 --> 32:12.583
- NO, ME NEITHER.

32:12.583 --> 32:14.125
- I SHOULD JUST
LEAVE IT ALONE.

32:14.125 --> 32:16.417
- MY MOTHER...

32:16.417 --> 32:20.000
YEAH, I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.333
- I'M GONNA TURN THESE IN
AND BE DONE WITH IT.

32:21.333 --> 32:24.083
- NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
I'LL DO IT.

32:24.083 --> 32:25.208
-THANKS.

32:33.917 --> 32:36.792
- YOU NEED TO DESTROY
THAT FILE, DEXTER.

32:36.792 --> 32:38.250
CLOSE THAT DOOR FOREVER.

33:01.667 --> 33:04.125
- I CAN'T LET HER
BE CUT UP AGAIN.

33:16.542 --> 33:18.500
- HEY, SWEETIE.
- HEY.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.125
- NOT ANOTHER GIFT.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.458
- NO, IT'S NOT A GIFT.

33:21.458 --> 33:26.333
IT'S A PUSH, REMEMBER?

33:26.333 --> 33:27.417
- WHAT'S THAT FOR?

33:27.417 --> 33:29.959
- IT'S FOR YOU.
IT'S YOUR NEW GUITAR.

33:29.959 --> 33:31.250
- WHY?

33:31.250 --> 33:32.834
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE GUITAR LESSONS.

33:32.834 --> 33:35.250
- SAYS WHO?

33:35.250 --> 33:37.208
- ME.

33:37.208 --> 33:40.500
- WE'LL SEE.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.875
- [sighing]

33:42.875 --> 33:44.417
I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO
YOU CAN'T FORCE THEM

33:44.417 --> 33:47.583
TO DO THINGS
THEY DON'T WANNA DO.

33:47.583 --> 33:49.083
- YEAH, I GUESS.

33:49.083 --> 33:53.166
- SO ARE YOU READY
FOR YOUR BIG WEEKEND?

33:53.166 --> 33:54.750
- WHAT BIG WEEKEND?

33:54.750 --> 33:58.125
- THE OVERNIGHT CAMPING TRIP
WITH THE YOUNG SAILORS.

33:58.125 --> 34:00.166
- I'M NOT A YOUNG SAILOR,
CODY IS.

34:00.166 --> 34:02.959
I'M A 30-SOMETHING SAILOR.

34:02.959 --> 34:05.041
- BUT YOU HAVE TO GO WITH HIM.
THAT'S PART OF THE DEAL.

34:05.041 --> 34:06.959
THEY NEED ADULTS WITH BOATS.

34:06.959 --> 34:09.291
YOU'RE SIGNED UP
TO TAKE FOUR OF THE BOYS.

34:09.291 --> 34:11.542
- I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.

34:17.208 --> 34:19.208
I DIDN'T KNOW
I'D HAVE TO GET SO INVOLVED.

34:19.208 --> 34:21.709
THIS ISN'T A GOOD WEEKEND
FOR ME.

34:21.709 --> 34:23.333
- DEXTER, WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO DO

34:23.333 --> 34:24.875
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT?

34:24.875 --> 34:27.291
- STUFF.

34:27.291 --> 34:29.583
- STUFF?
- STUFF.

34:29.583 --> 34:32.250
- YOU CAN'T CANCEL
BECAUSE OF STUFF.

34:32.250 --> 34:35.375
CODY WILL BE
SO DISAPPOINTED.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.917
- WELL, WHAT TIME DO WE
HAVE TO LEAVE IN THE MORNING?

34:37.917 --> 34:40.250
- YOU HAVE TO MEET
AT THE DOCKS AT 8:00 A.M.

34:40.250 --> 34:42.834
- IF I CAN'T DO FARROW
TOMORROW, I'LL DO HIM TONIGHT.

34:42.834 --> 34:44.542
EVERYTHING'S READY.

34:44.542 --> 34:47.875
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

34:47.875 --> 34:50.000
- I GOTTA PREP THE BOAT.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.792
IF WE'RE CAMPING OUT,
WE'LL NEED A TENT,

34:51.792 --> 34:54.041
SLEEPING BAGS,
FOOD, WATER.

34:54.041 --> 34:56.750
I GOTTA GET TWO CHILDREN'S
LIFE VESTS.

34:56.750 --> 34:58.750
ABDUCT JONATHAN FARROW
TAKE HIM BACK TO HIS STUDIO,

34:58.750 --> 35:01.250
KILL HIM, CUT HIM TO PIECES,
DUMP HIM IN THE OCEAN.

35:01.250 --> 35:05.291
HONESTLY, RITA, THIS IS
GONNA TAKE ME A WHILE.

35:05.291 --> 35:06.709
- DO YOU NEED SOME HELP?

35:06.709 --> 35:08.375
- NO, I GOT IT.

35:08.375 --> 35:11.875
- THIS REALLY MEANS A LOT
TO CODY.

35:11.875 --> 35:13.375
- ME TOO.

35:18.834 --> 35:21.792
AND SUDDENLY...

35:21.792 --> 35:23.709
TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.

35:23.709 --> 35:27.125
JONATHAN FARROW,
PARTY ANIMAL.

35:27.125 --> 35:30.417
OKAY, JONATHAN, PARTY LIKE
THERE'S NO TOMORROW.

35:38.458 --> 35:40.458
I'M ON MR. FARROW'S LIST.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.917
I DON'T HAVE ALL NIGHT.

36:26.917 --> 36:28.166
NEITHER DOES
JONATHAN FARROW.

36:28.166 --> 36:31.166
EXCUSE ME,
COULD YOU TELL MR. FARROW

36:31.166 --> 36:32.667
I JUST SAW A HOMELESS GUY
THROWING UP

36:32.667 --> 36:34.542
IN THE BACK SEAT OF HIS CAR?

37:00.208 --> 37:01.667
QUINN?

37:01.667 --> 37:03.291
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

37:03.291 --> 37:05.208
IT COULDN'T BE COINCIDENCE.

37:05.208 --> 37:07.667
THIS WHOLE THING
JUST BECAME TOO RISKY.

37:10.834 --> 37:14.667
CAN YOU BELIEVE HE'S HERE?

37:14.667 --> 37:16.709
- UH, WHO IS HE?

37:16.709 --> 37:18.959
- THAT'S QUINN.

37:18.959 --> 37:21.000
- I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.208
- YOU'D BE MAKING
A BIG MISTAKE.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.750
- HELLO.

37:40.750 --> 37:42.458
- HELLO YOURSELF.

37:42.458 --> 37:43.542
- YOU MUST BE QUINN?

37:43.542 --> 37:45.208
- I AM.

37:49.417 --> 37:51.375
THIS LAB GEEK
JUST FUCKING DITCH ME?

37:55.250 --> 37:58.250
- OKAY, TONIGHT'S
NOT THE NIGHT.

37:58.250 --> 38:00.375
GUESS I'M PREPPING THE BOAT
TO GO CAMPING AFTER ALL.

38:26.166 --> 38:28.667
THE BISCAYNE BAY, BOYS!

38:28.667 --> 38:33.000
HOME OF THE SEMINOLE INDIANS,
THE SPANISH CONQUISTADORS,

38:33.000 --> 38:34.333
CUTTHROAT PIRATES...

38:34.333 --> 38:38.959
AND NOW DEXTER MORGAN
AND FOUR SKINNY BOYS.

38:38.959 --> 38:40.875
HARRY USED TO TAKE ME CAMPING.

38:40.875 --> 38:43.333
IF I CAN'T KILL
JONATHAN FARROW TONIGHT,

38:43.333 --> 38:45.500
AT LEAST I CAN MAKE THE MOST
OF MY TIME WITH CODY.

39:46.375 --> 39:48.917
SEE, YOU JUST PULL IT TIGHT,
LIKE THAT,

39:48.917 --> 39:50.208
AND THAT'S YOUR BOWLINE.

39:50.208 --> 39:53.125
THAT'S MY PERSONAL FAVORITE.

39:53.125 --> 39:54.291
YOU MIGHT PREFER
A TAUT-LINE HITCH, THOUGH.

39:54.291 --> 39:55.625
I'LL SHOW YOU
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

39:55.625 --> 39:57.041
OR MAYBE YOU WANNA SEE
A TRUCKER'S HITCH

39:57.041 --> 39:57.917
THAT'S A FUN ONE.

39:57.917 --> 39:59.375
- DEXTER?

39:59.375 --> 40:00.625
- WHAT?

40:00.625 --> 40:02.792
- CAN I THROW DIRT CLODS?

40:02.792 --> 40:06.208
- OH, OKAY.

40:06.208 --> 40:08.875
- YOU FORGOT THE ROPE.

40:08.875 --> 40:09.917
- RIGHT...

40:13.917 --> 40:15.166
- YOU SEEM
A LITTLE DISTRACTED.

40:15.166 --> 40:17.041
- YEAH, WELL,
ARTHUR'S TECHNIQUE

40:17.041 --> 40:19.375
OF KEEPING THE KIDS BUSY
AND THEREFORE KEEPING ME FREE

40:19.375 --> 40:20.583
ISN'T WORKING OUT
LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO.

40:20.583 --> 40:23.250
- SO MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO KILL HIM.

40:23.250 --> 40:24.917
- AFTER FARROW.

40:44.583 --> 40:48.542
[cell phone ringing]

40:50.792 --> 40:51.917
HEY.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.583
- I JUST GOT THE OFFICIAL
GO AHEAD FROM LAGUERTA

40:54.583 --> 40:57.041
TO OPEN A TRINITY KILLER
INVESTIGATION.

40:57.041 --> 41:00.250
- REALLY?

41:00.250 --> 41:03.583
SHE WENT FOR THE WHOLE...

41:03.583 --> 41:05.417
SERIAL KILLER THING?

41:05.417 --> 41:08.750
- OKAY, LET'S CALL IT
A LIMITED TRINITY INVESTIGATION.

41:08.750 --> 41:10.083
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

41:10.083 --> 41:11.250
- RIGHT BEFORE I WENT IN,

41:11.250 --> 41:13.125
I REALIZED IF I PITCHED
THE ENTIRE TRINITY THEORY

41:13.125 --> 41:16.834
AND I ADDED THAT HE ALSO
SHOT ME AND LUNDY,

41:16.834 --> 41:18.041
I'D LOOK LIKE A FUCKING
LUNATIC.

41:18.041 --> 41:20.959
SO I BOILED IT DOWN
TO THE BARE ESSENTIALS.

41:20.959 --> 41:22.083
- WHICH ARE?

41:22.083 --> 41:23.417
- THE BLUDGEONINGS.

41:23.417 --> 41:24.458
THEY STILL GO BACK
30 YEARS.

41:24.458 --> 41:26.125
SO I CAN INVESTIGATE TRINITY

41:26.125 --> 41:29.250
WITHOUT LAGUERTA KNOWING
I'M INVESTIGATING TRINITY.

41:29.250 --> 41:31.291
- SMART.

41:31.291 --> 41:34.000
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?

41:34.000 --> 41:36.125
- I DON'T KNOW.

41:36.125 --> 41:37.250
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WHAT I DO KNOW

41:37.250 --> 41:39.208
IS THAT TRINITY KILLED FRANK.

41:39.208 --> 41:41.000
AND I'M GONNA CATCH HIM.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.542
- I'M SURE YOU WILL.

41:49.542 --> 41:51.125
- SO SARGE.

41:51.125 --> 41:52.917
WHAT'S THIS
ABOUT YOU AND LAGUERTA?

41:52.917 --> 41:55.667
A LITTLE BUMP AND GRIND?

41:55.667 --> 41:59.000
- DO NOT TALK ABOUT
LIEUTENANT LAGUERTA THAT WAY.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.125
COMPRENDE?

42:00.125 --> 42:02.959
- WOW, I'M SORRY.

42:02.959 --> 42:07.166
YOU MUST REALLY DIG HER.

42:07.166 --> 42:08.625
[speaking Spanish]

42:15.000 --> 42:16.250
- ANGEL.

42:16.250 --> 42:17.625
- QUINN JUST ASKED ME

42:17.625 --> 42:22.000
IF YOU AND I WERE
BUMPING AND GRINDING.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.667
- DEBRA MORGAN
ASKED ME THE SAME THING.

42:24.667 --> 42:26.375
WELL, NOT IN THOSE WORDS.

42:26.375 --> 42:27.750
- WHERE ARE THEY
GETTING THIS FROM?

42:27.750 --> 42:29.041
- I DON'T KNOW.

42:29.041 --> 42:30.208
- IT'S YOU.

42:30.208 --> 42:33.000
THE WAY YOU
KEEP LOOKING AT ME.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.125
EVERYWHERE I GO
YOU'RE STARING AT MY CULO.

42:36.125 --> 42:38.208
- OKAY, THAT IS SO
NOT TRUE.

42:38.208 --> 42:39.417
- IT IS TOO.

42:39.417 --> 42:42.166
NOW I KNOW...

42:42.166 --> 42:45.208
THAT I HAVE
A PRETTY NICE ASS,

42:45.208 --> 42:46.709
BUT YOU GOTTA STOP.

42:51.208 --> 42:56.208
- I MISS YOU, ANGEL.

42:56.208 --> 43:00.166
- I MISS YOU TOO.

43:00.166 --> 43:01.875
- BUT WE MADE OUR CHOICE.

43:01.875 --> 43:04.000
- YEAH, YEAH.

43:11.333 --> 43:13.417
- WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN...

43:13.417 --> 43:17.291
THEY HEARD A SCRATCHING NOISE
ON THE ROOF OF THE CAR.

43:17.291 --> 43:21.083
[scratching]

43:21.083 --> 43:22.417
WHAT WAS THAT?

43:22.417 --> 43:24.792
AND THEY THOUGHT,
"LET'S GET OUT OF HERE."

43:24.792 --> 43:26.959
SO THEY DROVE HOME
AS FAST AS THEY COULD.

43:26.959 --> 43:28.500
AND WHEN THEY GOT HOME,

43:28.500 --> 43:31.250
HE WENT AROUND TO OPEN
THE CAR DOOR

43:31.250 --> 43:32.959
FOR HIS GIRLFRIEND

43:32.959 --> 43:36.000
AND THERE HANGING
FROM THE HANDLE,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.709
A BLOODY HOOK!

43:38.709 --> 43:41.208
[laughter]

43:42.750 --> 43:45.083
- THAT DOESN'T EVEN
MAKE SENSE.

43:45.083 --> 43:46.834
- YOUR TURN, DEXTER.

43:46.834 --> 43:51.375
- UH, ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW
ANY SCARY STORIES.

43:51.375 --> 43:53.458
- OH, COME ON.
GIVE IT A SHOT.

43:53.458 --> 43:55.625
[all pleading]

43:55.625 --> 44:00.250
- ALL RIGHT.

44:00.250 --> 44:05.667
- THERE'S A MAN.

44:05.667 --> 44:08.250
YOU CAN CALL HIM
THE MAN OF THREE.

44:08.250 --> 44:13.250
YOU CAN CALL HIM TRINITY.

44:13.250 --> 44:14.625
YOU CAN CALL HIM
ANYTHING YOU WANT

44:14.625 --> 44:16.083
BUT THE FACT IS
HE'S NOT A MAN AT ALL.

44:16.083 --> 44:19.583
HE'S A MONSTER.

44:19.583 --> 44:24.542
HE WAS BORN IN A BATHTUB
FILLED WITH BLOOD.

44:24.542 --> 44:27.250
FOR COUNTLESS YEARS
HE'S ROAMED THE COUNTRYSIDE

44:27.250 --> 44:30.542
KILLING THE INNOCENT,
LEAVING BEHIND

44:30.542 --> 44:35.083
BITS OF HIS DEAD SISTER.

44:35.083 --> 44:39.458
SOMETIMES HE'LL SNEAK UP
ON A MAN

44:39.458 --> 44:43.333
AND RAISE
HIS HAMMER OVERHEAD,

44:43.333 --> 44:44.750
AND THEN HE'LL
SWING IT DOWN--

44:44.750 --> 44:47.834
- AND SMASH HIS OWN THUMB AND
THEN GO CRYING ALL THE WAY HOME,

44:47.834 --> 44:50.333
LIKE A LITTLE BABY.

44:50.333 --> 44:53.500
- THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

44:53.500 --> 44:56.041
- THAT WAS FUNNY.
- THANKS...

44:56.041 --> 44:58.709
- AND NOW I THINK IT'S TIME
TO HIT THE SLEEPING BAGS.

44:58.709 --> 45:01.875
YOU GUYS ARE BEAT.
YOU'VE HAD A HUGE DAY.

45:25.583 --> 45:26.709
- HEY, BUDDY.

45:26.709 --> 45:28.625
YOU NEED ANYTHING?

45:28.625 --> 45:29.583
- I'M GOOD.

45:29.583 --> 45:32.667
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

45:32.667 --> 45:34.375
- NO, I'M GOOD TOO.

45:48.458 --> 45:51.458
IT'S ONLY 9:00...

45:51.458 --> 45:53.458
THE KIDS WON'T WAKE UP
TILL IT'S LIGHT OUT.

45:53.458 --> 45:56.208
PLENTY OF TIME FOR ME.

47:10.625 --> 47:14.166
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON--
WHAT IS THIS?

47:14.166 --> 47:17.208
- THIS...

47:17.208 --> 47:19.166
IS THE DECISIVE MOMENT.

47:23.792 --> 47:24.959
WHAT'S THE NAME OF
THE PHOTOGRAPHER

47:24.959 --> 47:28.333
WHO ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT THAT?

47:28.333 --> 47:33.166
- CARTIER-BRESSON.
- RIGHT--RIGHT.

47:33.166 --> 47:36.000
ONCE YOU MISS IT
IT'S GONE FOREVER.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.166
A PERFECT MOMENT...

47:38.166 --> 47:40.500
FROZEN IN TIME.

47:40.500 --> 47:42.917
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, RIGHT?

47:42.917 --> 47:44.083
- YES, BUT--

47:44.083 --> 47:49.041
OW, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!

47:49.041 --> 47:52.125
WHO ARE YOU?

47:52.125 --> 47:53.750
- I'M THE PERSON WHO'S
GOING TO TO KEEP YOU

47:53.750 --> 47:56.458
FROM KILLING ANY MORE WOMEN.

47:56.458 --> 47:58.583
- WHAT?

47:58.583 --> 48:00.542
I'VE NEVER KILLED ANYONE.

48:00.542 --> 48:04.792
- YOU KILLED ESTRELLA CARAZO.

48:04.792 --> 48:06.542
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OTHERS...

48:06.542 --> 48:09.583
- I DIDN'T FUCKING KILL THEM!

48:09.583 --> 48:11.000
I PHOTOGRAPHED THEM!

48:11.000 --> 48:12.291
IT'S TOO FUCKING BAD
THEY'RE DEAD BUT I--

48:12.291 --> 48:14.792
- TOO FUCKING BAD
THEY'RE DEAD.

48:14.792 --> 48:19.625
- LIFE IS HARD,
AND IT'S BRUTAL AND UGLY,

48:19.625 --> 48:22.375
AND WAY TOO FUCKING SHORT.

48:22.375 --> 48:26.000
THAT'S WHY I SHOOT WHAT I DO,
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.125
- WHO ARE BRUISED AND CUT
AND BLEEDING.

48:29.125 --> 48:30.333
- OH, FUCK...

48:30.333 --> 48:33.875
IT'S FOR THE CONTRAST!

48:33.875 --> 48:35.375
YOU ADD A LITTLE BIT
OF THE REAL WORLD

48:35.375 --> 48:37.500
IT MAKES THEM ALL THE MORE
BEAUTIFUL.

48:37.500 --> 48:42.917
- UNTIL YOU KILL THEM.

48:42.917 --> 48:44.458
- IF THEY COULD THANK ME,
THEY FUCKING WOULD.

48:44.458 --> 48:45.750
BECAUSE OF MY PICTURES,

48:45.750 --> 48:47.500
THOSE WOMEN WILL LIVE ON
FOREVER!

48:47.500 --> 48:49.959
- NOTHING LASTS FOREVER.

48:49.959 --> 48:51.208
- [screaming]

49:06.250 --> 49:08.625
- MAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN DRAWN
TO THE SEA.

49:13.083 --> 49:16.041
BUT IT'S AN UNNATURAL
SETTING FOR US.

49:16.041 --> 49:17.709
A PLACE OF GREAT DANGER.

49:27.875 --> 49:32.333
TIDES, CURRENTS, WAVES,
WIND...

49:33.458 --> 49:35.583
EACH PRESENTING THEIR
OWN HAZARDS.

49:35.583 --> 49:38.959
NONE OF WHICH CAN BE IGNORED.

49:44.458 --> 49:46.458
THE SLIGHTEST LAPSE
OF JUDGMENT

49:46.458 --> 49:49.959
CAN BE A MISTAKE
YOU MIGHT NEVER RECOVER FROM.

49:53.417 --> 49:55.458
BUT A GOOD SAILOR
DOESN'T FIGHT

49:55.458 --> 49:58.083
AGAINST THESE ELEMENTS.

50:08.500 --> 50:10.834
A GOOD SAILOR WORKS
WITH THEM,

50:10.834 --> 50:13.000
USING THEM TO HIS ADVANTAGE.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
WHILE OTHERS LESS FORTUNATE
MIGHT BE FOREVER CAST ADRIFT,

50:17.000 --> 50:19.834
OFTEN IN SEVERAL PIECES.

50:19.834 --> 50:22.792
HE ALWAYS COMES HOME SAFELY.

50:42.667 --> 50:45.041
WHAT THE HELL?

50:48.709 --> 50:50.542
ISN'T THAT--

50:50.542 --> 50:52.041
- FARROW'S ASSISTANT.

50:52.041 --> 50:53.250
I JUST ARRESTED HIM
FOR THE MURDER

50:53.250 --> 50:55.709
OF ESTRELLA CARAZO.

50:55.709 --> 50:57.041
- BUT, NO,
I THOUGHT--

50:57.041 --> 50:58.208
- YEAH, AT FIRST
IT LOOKED LIKE FARROW,

50:58.208 --> 50:59.291
BUT THIS IS AIRTIGHT.

50:59.291 --> 51:01.625
WE GOT CAMERA FOOTAGE
FROM THE TOLLBOOTH

51:01.625 --> 51:03.834
OF HIM HEADING OVER
TO ALLIGATOR ALLEY.

51:03.834 --> 51:06.000
WE GOT DNA EVIDENCE.
WE GOT EVERYTHING.

51:31.333 --> 51:33.250
- I KILLED AN INNOCENT MAN.
