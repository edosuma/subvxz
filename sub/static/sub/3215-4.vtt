00:03.280 --> 00:05.528
Mr. Skokie, this is Chuck Palmer

00:05.554 --> 00:07.678
with the city of Modesto
Robbery/Homicide Division.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.529
You're going to see a
table with a body on it.

00:09.554 --> 00:12.225
I need you to tell me if
the body you see is your son.

00:12.250 --> 00:13.716
That's Matt.

00:13.752 --> 00:15.351
Is Gwen dead? Gwen's at the hospital.

00:15.387 --> 00:18.421
There are indications she
was sexually assaulted.

00:18.457 --> 00:19.789
Have you called his mother yet?

00:19.825 --> 00:21.105
Well, what are the police doing?

00:21.126 --> 00:22.859
We have four suspects in custody...

00:22.894 --> 00:26.296
Two who facilitated and one
who we believe is the shooter.

00:26.331 --> 00:28.131
I'm serving you with a notice of petition

00:28.166 --> 00:30.767
- to take possession of the remains of Matthew Skokie.
- What?

00:30.802 --> 00:32.101
I need you to get here, Mark.

00:32.137 --> 00:33.707
Okay, mom. I'll fly back as soon as I can.

00:33.732 --> 00:35.316
And you want to talk about
whether she was raped,

00:35.341 --> 00:36.902
- whether she wasn't raped.
- Yes, I do.

00:36.927 --> 00:38.675
- Why? What difference does it make?
- Because that is not

00:38.710 --> 00:40.043
- the child that I raised...
- Don't do it!

00:40.078 --> 00:41.311
Don't do it to her! Don't!

00:41.346 --> 00:42.979
Your son doesn't even
want to visit with you.

00:43.014 --> 00:44.314
How are you going to help him if
he doesn't want to talk to you?

00:44.349 --> 00:45.753
Yo, Tina!

00:45.778 --> 00:47.138
Come on. Get up. don't be a bitch.

00:47.146 --> 00:48.746
When are they gonna sign me out of here?

00:48.747 --> 00:49.949
Five weeks, six at most.

00:49.957 --> 00:51.890
You're gonna get counseling,
and you are going to engage

00:51.926 --> 00:53.806
your mother and your
brother when they get here.

00:53.827 --> 00:55.916
No, I'm gonna get you a lawyer
that's working for a cause,

00:55.941 --> 00:57.507
not a dollar.

00:57.542 --> 01:00.176
You take their drugs, you
sleep with their women,

01:00.212 --> 01:02.412
and then they put you in their cage.

01:02.447 --> 01:04.114
Don't come in here with your
fake-ass religion nonsense.

01:04.149 --> 01:05.348
What I believe is real.

01:12.424 --> 01:15.625
These are hard times.

01:15.660 --> 01:18.995
Hard times.

01:19.064 --> 01:23.466
Daily, we see the suffering of our people.

01:23.502 --> 01:28.438
We can testify to the inequities
our community lives with.

01:28.473 --> 01:32.142
Daily, our young brothers
are treated like criminals.

01:32.177 --> 01:35.211
Treated like animals.

01:35.247 --> 01:38.646
Even unarmed and innocent.

01:39.202 --> 01:40.635
Far too often,

01:40.671 --> 01:44.205
they are the ones left
shot dead in the street.

01:44.241 --> 01:47.709
We are not people to the oppressors.

01:47.744 --> 01:49.644
But we are not victims, either,

01:49.680 --> 01:53.014
my honorable brothers
and my beloved sisters.

01:53.050 --> 01:55.317
We are the original ones.

01:55.352 --> 01:59.020
He who is called the Messiah...

01:59.056 --> 02:02.624
The Mahdi, the Christ...

02:02.659 --> 02:05.860
He comes from us.

02:05.896 --> 02:07.796
He looks as we look.

02:10.100 --> 02:13.101
And I charge you to go
out into the greater world

02:13.136 --> 02:16.771
and... and achieve great
things for our people.

02:16.807 --> 02:19.808
"'Not by might nor by power,

02:19.843 --> 02:23.859
but by my spirit, ' saith the lord"!

02:23.884 --> 02:25.750
All praises to Allah!

02:25.786 --> 02:28.386
All praises to Allah!

02:28.422 --> 02:29.988
All praises to Allah!

02:30.023 --> 02:32.557
All praises to Allah!

02:57.182 --> 03:01.697
I... started smoking crack when I was 12.

03:01.729 --> 03:04.764
That was when my uncle
started making me, like...

03:04.799 --> 03:07.600
Do stuff to him or whatever.

03:07.635 --> 03:09.869
Being high made me forget.

03:09.878 --> 03:13.747
When I'm high, everything
just sort of disappears.

03:13.782 --> 03:15.749
My stupid parents didn't believe me

03:15.784 --> 03:17.417
when I told them what happened.

03:17.453 --> 03:20.754
They just got pissed and called me a liar

03:20.789 --> 03:24.024
and kicked me out on the streets.

03:24.059 --> 03:25.359
It's just so hard to stay clean

03:25.394 --> 03:28.362
when I've been addicted
to this stuff for so long.

03:28.397 --> 03:32.416
But I've been clean now for 30 days.

03:32.931 --> 03:35.969
Ain't nobody here made
it without pain, so...

03:36.004 --> 03:38.783
Oh, god.

03:40.946 --> 03:42.786
All right, Roger. Call
me if you need anything.

03:42.807 --> 03:45.781
- Hey. How was it?
- I'm doing what I'm supposed to.

03:45.806 --> 03:48.115
- I want to see Carter.
- I got you a lawyer.

03:48.150 --> 03:49.449
I want to see Carter.

03:49.485 --> 03:51.451
- He can't change the laws, Aubry.
- Then get another lawyer!

03:51.487 --> 03:52.686
I am going to those meetings.

03:52.721 --> 03:53.987
I am sitting through that garbage every day

03:54.022 --> 03:56.656
I'm doing everything I
can. I promise you, I am.

03:56.692 --> 03:58.492
Your mom and Brian are flying in.

03:58.527 --> 03:59.993
I put them off long enough.

04:00.028 --> 04:02.996
Now, we need to get you some
new clothes, fix your hair.

04:03.031 --> 04:04.498
Carter loves me the way I am.

04:04.533 --> 04:07.834
Carter is in jail. Your family's here.

04:07.870 --> 04:10.170
You need to show that
you're making an effort.

04:17.379 --> 04:19.346
Damn it.

04:22.175 --> 04:23.474
So, what are we doing today?

04:23.509 --> 04:25.142
We're fixing this.

04:25.178 --> 04:27.077
Well, tell me what you don't like about it.

04:27.113 --> 04:28.312
Where do I start?

04:28.347 --> 04:31.624
I told the woman I want the
same haircut I walked in with,

04:31.649 --> 04:32.591
only shorter.

04:32.627 --> 04:34.226
Instead, she gave me this. Okay.

04:34.262 --> 04:35.527
Well, we can thin it out.

04:35.563 --> 04:37.196
And then she curled it.

04:37.231 --> 04:38.297
Well, we won't do that. Mm.

04:38.332 --> 04:40.966
We'll give you something easy to deal with.

04:41.002 --> 04:43.068
But before we get you shampooed,

04:43.104 --> 04:45.474
is it okay if I give you
a little head massage?

04:46.483 --> 04:48.366
What do you mean? What is that?

04:48.397 --> 04:50.163
Well, I put my hands on your head,

04:50.199 --> 04:54.835
and I massage a little bit,
just to get everything relaxed.

04:56.037 --> 04:57.571
I guess.

05:04.446 --> 05:08.482
So, are you new to Modesto?

05:10.422 --> 05:12.989
Yeah. Uh, yes.

05:25.452 --> 05:27.386
Mark!

05:27.421 --> 05:28.887
Oh, my god!

05:28.922 --> 05:31.790
Oh, my god! Hey.

05:34.828 --> 05:36.295
He's suing me.

05:36.329 --> 05:38.729
- He sent some man after me in a parking lot.
- He did what?

05:38.766 --> 05:40.866
Not suing... I don't know the word,

05:40.901 --> 05:43.802
but he's served papers.

05:43.836 --> 05:45.676
This is all about Matt's funeral?

05:46.423 --> 05:48.948
That man has no judgment

05:48.973 --> 05:51.607
he can't make a single decision on his own.

05:51.632 --> 05:53.298
And when he does, it's the wrong one.

05:53.333 --> 05:56.101
And Tom and Eve, they're completely...

05:56.136 --> 05:58.887
They turn everything into
an "us vs. them" situation.

05:58.912 --> 06:01.292
And you know Russ, always the follower,

06:01.317 --> 06:03.990
which leaves me as the
only one to fight for Matt

06:04.015 --> 06:05.281
they convinced Russ

06:05.316 --> 06:08.050
that Matt should be buried
in Oakland, of all places.

06:08.086 --> 06:10.153
Your brother deserves better than this.

06:10.188 --> 06:13.723
He was always there for
us when we needed him.

06:13.759 --> 06:16.626
Even his country, signing up after 9/11...

06:16.661 --> 06:18.561
That's the kind of person he was.

06:18.597 --> 06:20.663
Is there any chance he could win?

06:24.773 --> 06:28.141
I'll talk to Russ.

06:28.507 --> 06:30.540
Thank you.

06:31.737 --> 06:34.144
You have no idea.

06:36.386 --> 06:38.920
You look different. Get a haircut?

06:38.955 --> 06:41.356
Oh.

06:41.391 --> 06:44.292
It looks good, mom.

06:44.328 --> 06:46.227
It makes you look young.

06:53.337 --> 06:55.503
Are you sure you don't want to come in?

06:55.539 --> 06:57.572
No.

06:57.607 --> 06:59.607
Mom, it's the right thing to do.

06:59.643 --> 07:01.124
And I've done it.

07:01.149 --> 07:02.870
If you want to go in and pay your respects,

07:02.875 --> 07:04.341
I'll wait for you here.

07:04.376 --> 07:08.151
Okay.

07:26.734 --> 07:30.226
Go ahead, Mark. She'd like it.

07:32.730 --> 07:37.433
Doctors say she's improving,
responding to stimuli.

07:37.468 --> 07:41.937
Sometimes it's like she
squeezes back, you know?

07:41.973 --> 07:45.917
I can feel her trying.

07:45.942 --> 07:48.176
Can she hear us?

07:48.211 --> 07:51.446
I brought in a radio to play music to her.

07:51.481 --> 07:54.051
I talk to her.

07:54.076 --> 07:56.317
Don't I, sweetie?

07:56.353 --> 07:58.887
I pray with her.

08:00.957 --> 08:03.691
I'm so sorry.

08:03.727 --> 08:06.461
They're gonna take her off the ventilator.

08:06.496 --> 08:09.397
If she can breathe on her own,

08:09.432 --> 08:11.533
it's a sign she's gonna make it.

08:16.940 --> 08:19.908
Aren't you, girl? You're gonna make it.

08:21.878 --> 08:24.512
How you doing this morning, Mr. Nix?

08:24.548 --> 08:27.348
Can I call you "Carter"?

08:27.384 --> 08:29.150
He's your lawyer?

08:29.186 --> 08:32.153
Brother Timothy is here to represent you.

08:33.097 --> 08:35.222
Man, what you got... bad news or worse?

08:35.246 --> 08:38.169
It's very positive. The
lab results came back.

08:38.210 --> 08:40.844
The bullet recovered
from Matt Skokie's body

08:40.878 --> 08:42.510
doesn't match the ballistics

08:42.547 --> 08:44.346
from the gun found in your possession.

08:44.382 --> 08:46.015
The prosecution's known this,

08:46.050 --> 08:48.350
and they've kept it quiet
as long as they could.

08:48.386 --> 08:52.521
Their case is getting weaker.
They don't have the gun.

08:52.557 --> 08:55.024
They don't have your
DNA on the woman's body.

08:57.094 --> 08:59.114
So... what's it mean?

08:59.139 --> 09:01.582
Brother Timothy's trying
to get a bail hearing.

09:01.607 --> 09:04.200
- I'm not waiting.
- And based on the new circumstances,

09:04.235 --> 09:05.534
- we think we can get you bail.
- I'm gonna look these people in the eye

09:05.570 --> 09:07.043
and ask them why they're lying.

09:07.068 --> 09:10.139
So if I have a bail
hearing, can Aubry be there?

09:13.050 --> 09:14.577
Can she?

09:15.995 --> 09:17.413
It's open court.

09:17.448 --> 09:19.222
Anyone in the public can go,

09:19.247 --> 09:22.051
which means the families of the victims

09:22.086 --> 09:24.553
are going to be there, too.

09:24.589 --> 09:27.056
To parade their sad faces
and make you look like

09:27.091 --> 09:29.391
the very definition of
the fearsome black man.

09:29.427 --> 09:31.393
What's that got to do with Aubry?

09:31.429 --> 09:33.395
How will it look to have
the little white girl

09:33.431 --> 09:34.911
who turns your tricks waiting for you?

09:34.932 --> 09:37.066
- She's not a whore!
- She's a drug addict.

09:37.101 --> 09:39.902
You need to present yourself
with pride and dignity.

09:39.937 --> 09:42.071
In my red jumpsuit?

09:42.106 --> 09:43.973
With my hands and feet shackled?

09:45.009 --> 09:47.309
Clean yourself up.

09:47.345 --> 09:50.879
At least shave that mess on your face.

10:01.907 --> 10:03.907
Get it off.

10:03.942 --> 10:05.508
We called a painter.

10:05.545 --> 10:07.945
He can redo the wall, but
he can't get here until...

10:07.981 --> 10:11.649
Just get some paint. I'll do it myself.

make you go in, listen
to some dude sing songs.

11:30.191 --> 11:32.625
That dude was tired.

11:32.660 --> 11:34.460
But the rest of it's all good.

11:34.495 --> 11:37.396
Got you playing ball, got you working out.

11:37.432 --> 11:41.467
It's like a street camp.
You get some hookups going.

11:41.502 --> 11:42.969
Yeah?

11:43.004 --> 11:44.914
Yeah.

11:44.939 --> 11:47.063
If it gets tight on the inside,

11:47.088 --> 11:48.898
tight when you get back on the outside.

11:48.923 --> 11:51.190
Get some eses looking out for you.

11:51.225 --> 11:53.158
Not a bitch no more.

11:53.194 --> 11:56.228
I'm not a bitch.

11:56.263 --> 11:57.696
Yeah, say that for real.

11:57.732 --> 11:58.831
I'm not a bitch!

11:58.866 --> 12:00.899
Hey! Watch your language.

12:00.935 --> 12:04.002
Next time you get sat up in
front of your parole officer,

12:04.038 --> 12:06.305
just be like, "yes, sir, no, sir."

12:06.340 --> 12:07.340
Give them your grill,

12:07.375 --> 12:09.274
and they'll slide you right out of here.

12:09.310 --> 12:11.410
Right?

12:11.445 --> 12:14.012
Juvie ain't nothing.

12:14.048 --> 12:17.495
Hang close, do how I do,

12:17.520 --> 12:19.086
and you'll be out of here in no time.

12:25.076 --> 12:27.497
I didn't know you were
coming in last night.

12:27.522 --> 12:29.568
Why didn't you tell me? I-I
could have picked you up.

12:29.593 --> 12:31.889
No, it was just easier this way. I
didn't want you and mom to get in...

12:31.924 --> 12:33.844
Huh. Yeah, I mean, you
go out to dinner with her?

12:33.860 --> 12:35.926
- Are you staying with her?
- Russ, come on. I don't want to get into that.

12:35.962 --> 12:38.062
No, of course. Of... of course.

12:38.097 --> 12:40.664
Well, how... how you doing? You look good.

12:40.700 --> 12:43.434
- You're... army still good for you?
- Yeah.

12:43.469 --> 12:44.869
- Yeah, I like Germany.
- Yeah?

12:44.904 --> 12:48.806
- Um, I get to see a bit of Europe on my time off.
- Yeah.

12:48.841 --> 12:52.343
- You doing all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm... I'm okay.

12:52.378 --> 12:53.978
Feels good to be busy.

12:54.013 --> 12:56.080
Yeah.

12:56.115 --> 12:59.483
You, uh... you still, um, staying at the...

12:59.519 --> 13:01.285
I-I got a, um...

13:01.320 --> 13:03.220
A motel... room. Yeah.

13:03.256 --> 13:05.990
I'm looking for something more like a...

13:06.025 --> 13:07.625
Like a home, you know?

13:07.660 --> 13:10.394
A sublet or, you know, a place...

13:10.429 --> 13:12.363
A place that has a living
room and a... and a fridge

13:12.398 --> 13:14.531
that I don't have to crouch down to reach.

13:14.557 --> 13:16.156
So you plan on staying here a while?

13:16.191 --> 13:18.555
Yeah, well, at least through the trial.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.666
People here are nice.

13:20.691 --> 13:26.502
Yeah. You seem to be going
to a lot of effort here. Hmm?

13:26.527 --> 13:30.089
Getting a new job, leaving Arizona.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.559
No, I'm gonna... I'm
gonna keep my place there.

13:32.594 --> 13:35.628
I mean, I... I plan to go back eventually.

13:35.664 --> 13:36.944
So why is it so important to you

13:36.965 --> 13:39.132
that Matt gets buried in Oakland?

13:39.167 --> 13:42.068
Come on. Couldn't you
just let this one play out?

13:42.103 --> 13:43.703
Matt and Gwen should be buried together.

13:43.738 --> 13:45.672
Well, I spoke to Eve,

13:45.707 --> 13:47.106
and she says that Gwen's getting better.

13:47.142 --> 13:48.575
She might make it.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.176
And if she does get better,

13:50.212 --> 13:53.479
then Gwen gets to decide
what happens to Matt's body,

13:53.515 --> 13:55.748
so  it's just a...

13:55.784 --> 13:58.017
It's a whole lot of hurt over nothing.

13:59.855 --> 14:01.921
Not for nothing.

14:04.759 --> 14:07.794
I'm not afraid of your mother anymore.

14:07.829 --> 14:09.095
And she knows it.

14:09.130 --> 14:11.731
You know, Russ...

14:11.766 --> 14:14.300
It's really hard for
me to come all this way

14:14.336 --> 14:15.602
with everything that's going on

14:15.637 --> 14:17.070
and have the two of you
still go at it like this.

14:17.105 --> 14:18.872
You're right. You're right. You're right.

14:18.907 --> 14:22.308
You're right. I'm, uh...

14:22.344 --> 14:25.111
Listen, I-I'm sorry if I...

14:25.146 --> 14:27.849
I don't... I don't want you... I don't

14:27.874 --> 14:30.325
- want you to be in the middle, okay?
- Well, it's not...

14:30.351 --> 14:31.950
- Russ.
- Yeah?

14:31.985 --> 14:33.118
You with a customer?

14:33.152 --> 14:35.519
Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm on.

14:35.556 --> 14:36.822
Okay. Excuse me, sir.

14:36.857 --> 14:38.323
Oh. Yeah.

14:47.334 --> 14:49.539
The case had not finished
a technical review.

14:49.564 --> 14:52.637
We only had the preliminary
findings of one criminalist.

14:52.673 --> 14:55.273
- What you did was illegal and immoral.
- We were waiting to hear from another...

14:55.308 --> 14:57.875
No, I'm afraid it's not.
It's called being thorough.

14:57.911 --> 15:00.011
Don't you condescend to me.

15:00.046 --> 15:02.947
I'm an educated woman.
don't treat me like I'm not.

15:02.983 --> 15:04.750
I'm sure.

15:04.785 --> 15:06.718
But we're talking about the law.

15:06.754 --> 15:08.887
So, if there are other legal issues

15:08.922 --> 15:10.222
you're having trouble with,

15:10.257 --> 15:12.524
I encourage you to
reach out to this office,

15:12.559 --> 15:15.360
and we'll try to explain them

15:15.396 --> 15:18.697
in a way that you're more fully understand.

15:18.732 --> 15:20.699
"Soderbergh."

15:20.733 --> 15:23.367
What kind of name is that?

15:25.472 --> 15:27.939
My brother deserves due process.

15:27.975 --> 15:29.441
We're taking this to a judge,

15:29.476 --> 15:32.644
and we're getting a bail hearing.

15:36.282 --> 15:39.139
It's the best rehab facility
in Stanislaus County.

15:39.164 --> 15:41.280
- It's Stanislaus, like "coleslaw."
- I had a nice, long talk with a

15:41.305 --> 15:44.546
woman who runs it, and she said that
even though there's a waiting list,

15:44.571 --> 15:47.422
- they would take you next Tuesday.
- I'm not going.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.257
I don't have to, as long as I keep
going to the meetings, right, dad?

15:50.282 --> 15:51.848
Did I say that? I didn't say that.

15:51.884 --> 15:55.252
The meetings are good, but
they're not good enough.

15:55.287 --> 15:59.212
You need something more... comprehensive.

16:01.894 --> 16:04.127
Your father and Brian and I

16:04.163 --> 16:06.396
- all want the same thing... Aubry?
- Yeah?

16:06.432 --> 16:08.031
And what's that?

16:08.067 --> 16:10.133
For you to get back on your feet.

16:10.169 --> 16:12.305
To get clean.

16:13.275 --> 16:14.541
Do you remember that card store they opened

16:14.577 --> 16:16.009
last year on Kilbourn Avenue?

16:16.045 --> 16:17.911
No, and I haven't been to
Milwaukee in how long now?

16:17.947 --> 16:19.179
Well, my friend Harris
opened this card store

16:19.214 --> 16:20.981
with all these cute, little knickknacks.

16:21.016 --> 16:23.183
It's a fun little store.

16:23.218 --> 16:26.410
And Harris said that he could
use some help on the weekends.

16:26.435 --> 16:29.879
That way, once you're done
with rehab, you've got a job.

16:29.904 --> 16:33.405
I'm not going to rehab or Milwaukee.

16:33.440 --> 16:36.241
I'm staying here.

16:36.277 --> 16:43.348
Michael, if Aubry wants to
stay in Modesto, she can stay.

16:43.384 --> 16:45.183
And I'll stay, too.

16:48.689 --> 16:50.231
Maybe I'll learn to see what it is

16:50.256 --> 16:52.657
you like so much about this place.

16:53.994 --> 16:55.594
Aubry?

16:55.629 --> 16:58.530
Aubry.

17:00.200 --> 17:04.102
I can't breathe with
these people here, Carter.

17:06.983 --> 17:09.942
I can't be around them.

17:09.977 --> 17:14.084
- You need to hang in there.
- Yeah.

17:14.108 --> 17:15.795
My sister did it.

17:15.819 --> 17:18.053
Bail hearing's Friday at 3:00.

17:18.089 --> 17:20.656
- I want you to be there.
- You know I will.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.626
I'm gonna get out of here, Aubry.

17:24.662 --> 17:26.729
I need you to hang in there.

17:26.763 --> 17:29.631
Yeah.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.266
Aubry?

17:31.302 --> 17:32.868
Yeah?

17:32.903 --> 17:35.137
Aubry.

17:35.172 --> 17:37.539
Aubry.

17:42.646 --> 17:45.981
I love you.

18:07.025 --> 18:10.226
Come on. Just keep telling
it... the dress, the dress.

18:10.261 --> 18:12.528
What... you need to finish
something off or something?

18:12.563 --> 18:14.130
Shut up, man!

18:14.165 --> 18:15.431
All right, so, you know,

18:15.466 --> 18:17.767
- I'm trying to get to her tetas, right?
- Yeah.

18:17.802 --> 18:23.372
But her dress... it's
like a giant chastity suit

18:23.408 --> 18:26.014
with, like, buttons and
zippers and ties and...

18:26.039 --> 18:29.444
So, you know, I'm working
away. I'm working away.

18:29.469 --> 18:31.545
And by this time, she's got my pants off.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.468
Yeah! You know what I'm saying?

18:33.493 --> 18:37.561
And she's giving me a good
Polish with her hand, you know.

18:38.865 --> 18:42.604
So, then, yo, I finally
get the dress off, right?

18:42.629 --> 18:48.080
And there she is, my girl,
you know, ripe, ready,

18:48.105 --> 18:50.941
and so I go to start kissing her stomach,

18:50.976 --> 18:54.425
and then I'm like, "yo,
what the hell is this?"

18:54.450 --> 18:56.613
You know, it's 'cause she had, like,

18:56.638 --> 19:00.715
panty hose, like, all over her body.

19:00.740 --> 19:04.725
So then I tell her, like,
"yo, what the hell is this?"

19:04.761 --> 19:06.327
And you know what she says?

19:06.362 --> 19:08.162
- Just say it!
- Just say it, just say it.

19:08.198 --> 19:09.198
All right.

19:09.232 --> 19:12.300
She goes, "oh, honey, don't you worry.

19:12.335 --> 19:14.435
It's got a hole right where you need it."

19:19.509 --> 19:22.076
That's my girl, right there.

19:28.068 --> 19:29.667
Show me what you got, ese.

19:29.703 --> 19:32.537
I got my own problems, man.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.172
Just let me through.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.773
I know you're coming from the ward.

19:35.809 --> 19:37.108
Told you to get busy

19:37.143 --> 19:39.544
with all those little
pills they got up in there.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.613
Who you answer to?

19:41.648 --> 19:43.620
You a snitch?

19:43.645 --> 19:46.465
Nah, man, I ain't no snitch.

19:46.490 --> 19:49.315
I'm just trying to speak on my situation.

19:49.351 --> 19:50.917
Let me talk to the man.

19:50.952 --> 19:53.052
You wanted to run your mouth?

19:53.088 --> 19:54.721
Let's go. Speak on it.

19:54.756 --> 19:56.956
I'm not looking for no trouble.

19:56.992 --> 19:59.759
I'm just in this joint long
enough to get my leg better.

19:59.794 --> 20:01.227
What happened, man?

20:01.263 --> 20:04.330
Cops shot me. Messed me up bad.

20:04.372 --> 20:07.239
When I'm done, they're
sending me back to Mexico.

20:07.264 --> 20:09.736
I got some serious bull...
I got to deal with back there.

20:09.771 --> 20:12.038
What you do back home?

20:12.073 --> 20:13.673
They're trying to put a murder on me,

20:13.708 --> 20:15.642
and I don't got a way to fight it.

20:15.676 --> 20:20.335
Look... I'm not slinking
like no bitch in the corner.

20:20.360 --> 20:23.428
If I was, then I need to
get treated like a bitch.

20:23.463 --> 20:27.032
I come in here, and I ask you straight up.

20:27.067 --> 20:29.801
Just let me roll by, man.
I got trouble how it is.

20:29.836 --> 20:31.770
I'm not trying to bring any more around.

20:31.805 --> 20:33.695
So you want out of the gang.

20:33.720 --> 20:37.309
So what, you're leaving Los Cuetes?

20:40.981 --> 20:44.049
Yeah. I'm done.

20:47.321 --> 20:49.721
Yeah, you done, bitch.

20:52.225 --> 20:56.261
You one stupid-ass loser.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.563
Get your ass out of here.

21:13.475 --> 21:14.574
We talked to the two men

21:14.610 --> 21:16.042
that Gwen was having relationships with.

21:16.078 --> 21:17.825
What did they say?

21:17.850 --> 21:19.450
They accounted for their whereabouts

21:19.485 --> 21:20.751
at the time of the assault.

21:20.786 --> 21:22.519
Their alibis checked out.

21:22.555 --> 21:24.154
I wanted you and your wife to know

21:24.190 --> 21:27.091
that we've ruled them out as suspects.

21:27.126 --> 21:28.726
What else did they say?

21:28.761 --> 21:32.010
They talk about the nature
of their relationships?

21:32.035 --> 21:34.298
Yes.

21:34.333 --> 21:36.900
I'd like to read what they said.

21:36.936 --> 21:38.869
I don't think that's a good idea.

21:38.904 --> 21:42.728
If you can't make a copy,
I'll read it while I'm here.

21:42.753 --> 21:43.974
Most of what these men said

21:44.010 --> 21:45.609
had nothing to do with the crime.

21:45.645 --> 21:47.411
I don't see how going over
all of that is gonna help any.

21:47.446 --> 21:49.780
Please.

21:49.815 --> 21:52.616
It can't be worse than what I'm imagining.

22:25.987 --> 22:28.488
Things are going well for you here, Tony.

22:28.523 --> 22:29.789
Do you agree?

22:29.822 --> 22:32.357
Yes, sir, I've been going
to counseling and to classes.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.127
You've been working on some of the things

22:34.162 --> 22:35.602
that made being at home difficult...

22:35.663 --> 22:37.697
Your resentment of your father,

22:37.732 --> 22:39.132
your anger at not being trusted.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.593
I know he was just trying
to do what's good for me.

22:41.628 --> 22:45.463
I should cut him some
slack, open up to him more.

22:46.557 --> 22:49.524
Tony, we're inclined to discharge you,

22:49.549 --> 22:52.203
see how things go.

22:53.244 --> 22:54.819
But you'll have to go to
family-counseling sessions

22:54.844 --> 22:57.296
with your father every week.

22:57.321 --> 22:58.910
So, you feel ready to take this on?

22:58.945 --> 23:01.304
- Yes!
- You ready to go home?

23:01.329 --> 23:03.396
Yes.

23:03.421 --> 23:04.787
Okay?

23:44.393 --> 23:45.826
Based on the new information,

23:45.861 --> 23:48.428
the fact that the ballistics
and the DNA didn't match,

23:48.464 --> 23:51.498
the defense has been
granted a bail hearing.

23:51.534 --> 23:52.966
Isn't there something you
can do? Are you serious?

23:53.002 --> 23:55.024
He can... he can go free?

23:55.049 --> 23:57.525
- Who did this?
- It isn't my choice. It was the judge's decision.

23:57.550 --> 23:58.605
Who brought it to the judge?

23:58.641 --> 24:00.374
The defense made a bail review application,

24:00.409 --> 24:02.376
and the judge decided to revisit the issue.

24:02.411 --> 24:04.073
Can't... can't you do something to stop it?

24:04.098 --> 24:05.498
They have a right to a hearing.

24:05.533 --> 24:07.299
But you'd better believe I'll fight back.

24:07.335 --> 24:09.971
Look... the fact that the gun doesn't match

24:09.996 --> 24:12.104
doesn't exculpate him,
doesn't mean he's innocent.

24:12.140 --> 24:13.439
It raises questions...

24:13.474 --> 24:16.142
But the fact that he had a gun,
I mean, that... that shows...

24:16.177 --> 24:17.476
He could have had two guns,

24:17.512 --> 24:18.811
used one for the murder and
then another one at home.

24:18.846 --> 24:20.579
It's also possible, of course.

24:20.615 --> 24:22.415
He still could have raped Gwen.
He could have used a condom.

24:22.450 --> 24:24.429
All of that... those are
arguments I'll make to the judge.

24:24.454 --> 24:26.020
Did you find a condom?

24:26.738 --> 24:29.870
No, but that doesn't mean one wasn't used.

24:29.925 --> 24:33.265
We'll continue to investigate
and build our case against him.

24:33.300 --> 24:35.066
We still have Hector Tontz,

24:35.102 --> 24:37.669
who places Mr. Nix near
the scene of the crime

24:37.704 --> 24:39.805
and in possession of Matt's wallet.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.107
Those are very strong pieces of evidence.

24:42.142 --> 24:43.742
But in the meantime,
he could still get out.

24:43.777 --> 24:45.043
Well, there's absolutely

24:45.078 --> 24:46.344
nothing automatic about a bail hearing.

24:46.380 --> 24:47.820
- It...
- But he could still get out.

24:47.848 --> 24:49.288
- Yes or no?
- Even if they granted bail,

24:49.315 --> 24:50.581
I can't imagine they'd
set it at a level that I...

24:50.617 --> 24:53.985
Just answer me. Please make him answer me.

24:54.869 --> 24:56.335
He could. Yes.

24:56.370 --> 24:59.171
I-I don't know why we're
even talking about this.

24:59.206 --> 25:01.774
He did it. He killed Matt,
and then he tried to kill Gwen.

25:01.809 --> 25:04.076
The fact that this is... absurd.

25:04.111 --> 25:07.246
This is... I feel like I'm
in some village in China.

25:07.281 --> 25:09.014
This is a setback, but that's all it is.

25:09.050 --> 25:10.149
There are other theories,

25:10.184 --> 25:11.660
and we're investigating them aggressively.

25:11.685 --> 25:13.129
Like what?

25:14.409 --> 25:17.776
- The police interviewed the men that Gwen was sleeping with.
- What?

25:17.801 --> 25:20.436
- They told me that neither of them is a suspect.
- What did you say?

25:20.461 --> 25:22.902
Uh, Gwen was unfaithful to your brother.

25:22.927 --> 25:24.631
Well, your son was the one, actually,
who broke his vow to protect...

25:24.666 --> 25:26.749
We've all found out things
about Gwen and Matt's lifestyle.

25:26.774 --> 25:30.310
- There are things that have come to...
- "Lifestyle"? I'm sorry.

25:30.338 --> 25:31.437
What do you mean, "Matt's lifestyle"?

25:31.473 --> 25:33.072
There are things that
have come to the surface.

25:33.108 --> 25:34.507
- We need to deal with them.
- He didn't have a lifestyle.

25:34.543 --> 25:36.265
Just please know we will.

25:38.359 --> 25:39.890
The bail hearing is Friday.

25:40.827 --> 25:42.765
I assure you... we'll be ready.

25:46.740 --> 25:48.822
Well, I don't trust him anymore.

25:48.857 --> 25:50.924
What the hell is he talking about...

25:50.959 --> 25:52.138
"Matt's lifestyle"?

25:52.163 --> 25:54.631
Oh, I think you know exactly
what he's talking about.

25:54.656 --> 25:56.556
No, Tom, I don't. Do you?

25:56.581 --> 25:57.941
They found drugs in the house.

25:57.966 --> 25:59.899
- They say they did.
- They found them.

25:59.935 --> 26:02.168
- They say.
- Gwen said.

26:02.204 --> 26:05.939
- Gwen told me that Matt was selling drugs, okay?
- Yeah.

26:05.974 --> 26:07.874
So admit it, Barb...

26:07.909 --> 26:11.144
Your son was an addict and a drug dealer.

26:11.179 --> 26:13.413
- Show some respect, Tom.
- Why do you think those men

26:13.448 --> 26:15.348
were even in the house to begin with, hmm?

26:15.383 --> 26:16.983
They were there because
of Matt and his drugs.

26:17.018 --> 26:18.818
Your daughter was the
one who had the problems.

26:18.854 --> 26:20.286
Your daughter was the one
who was sleeping around.

26:20.322 --> 26:22.422
- Wait, wait, Barb.
- Okay, don't you say a word about Gwen.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.545
You and your family...

26:24.570 --> 26:26.326
I have been defending her the whole time.

26:26.361 --> 26:28.185
You... you...

26:28.210 --> 26:30.779
My daughter was a slut.

26:30.804 --> 26:32.935
How dare you talk about our girl like that.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.802
At least I can admit it.

26:35.837 --> 26:40.190
So, Barb, admit that
your son was an addict.

26:40.215 --> 26:41.615
He was not an addict.

26:41.650 --> 26:43.750
You're upset about what Gwen was doing.

26:43.785 --> 26:46.853
That doesn't mean you can
make accusations about Matt.

26:46.889 --> 26:48.488
No, you and I... we...
We talked man-to-man,

26:48.524 --> 26:50.290
and I asked you if there were anything...

26:50.325 --> 26:52.192
Issues with the kids, and you... you lied.

26:52.227 --> 26:54.494
- I didn't lie. I told you the truth...
- Just like when you had your...

26:54.530 --> 26:56.463
- The whole truth, everything that was...
- Your gambling addiction, you lied.

26:56.498 --> 26:58.265
You lied.

26:58.300 --> 26:59.566
And your son is no better than you.

26:59.601 --> 27:01.201
Okay, this isn't helping anything.

27:01.236 --> 27:02.669
How do you know they weren't Gwen's drugs?

27:02.704 --> 27:04.471
How do you know she didn't get high

27:04.506 --> 27:06.439
before she started passing herself around?

27:06.475 --> 27:08.041
If we're gonna have the conversation,

27:08.076 --> 27:09.843
- we're gonna have the conversation.
- Hey, that's enough, Barb.

27:09.878 --> 27:10.877
- Let's have it.
- Let's have it.

27:10.913 --> 27:12.512
Let's have that conversation, Barb,

27:12.548 --> 27:14.314
because the things Gwen's told me...

27:14.349 --> 27:16.160
- Oh, the things she's said.
- What? What did she...

27:16.185 --> 27:19.853
If you really want to talk
about truth and lies, Barb,

27:19.888 --> 27:22.102
then we should talk!

27:22.127 --> 27:23.868
But you need to go first.

27:23.893 --> 27:25.994
Everybody done?

27:26.029 --> 27:28.096
You done blaming each other?

27:28.131 --> 27:29.597
Yeah, I gambled.

27:29.633 --> 27:34.502
That's got nothing to do
with my son getting killed.

27:34.537 --> 27:36.804
Matt and Gwen deserve better
than what happened to them,

27:36.840 --> 27:41.476
and they deserve better than
what we're doing right here.

27:41.865 --> 27:43.331
Gwen's gonna survive,

27:43.356 --> 27:45.772
and she's gonna need you every day.

27:47.517 --> 27:50.151
Maybe it's for the best.

27:51.521 --> 27:53.988
At least that way she
won't be able to... around.

27:54.024 --> 27:56.491
Oh, my god.

27:56.788 --> 27:59.083
You can drag down your
daughter if you want.

27:59.108 --> 28:01.029
But I know my child was a good child,

28:01.064 --> 28:03.665
and I'm not about to sit
around and fight with you all

28:03.700 --> 28:05.833
while the animal who shot him walks.

28:05.869 --> 28:07.502
I mean, what is the...

28:07.537 --> 28:10.872
"An eye for an eye," isn't that right, Eve?

28:21.878 --> 28:23.978
It's a glorious day, isn't it?

28:24.013 --> 28:25.013
Yes.

28:25.014 --> 28:27.148
Yes, it is glorious.

28:27.183 --> 28:28.816
You know, I remember there was a time

28:28.852 --> 28:30.685
when I would say, "it's a nice day.

28:30.720 --> 28:33.754
The sky is blue, but I
wish it was even bluer."

28:35.158 --> 28:38.993
"The temperature's right, but I
wish it were more to my liking."

28:39.028 --> 28:43.478
Does that sound familiar?

28:43.503 --> 28:46.736
I worked hard. I was
blessed with good things.

28:46.761 --> 28:50.972
I had a house full... a house
full of things, just things.

28:51.007 --> 28:56.068
But for all I had, I still wanted more.

28:56.093 --> 28:59.226
So I bought a bigger house.

29:00.842 --> 29:02.786
And I filled that house with things.

29:06.819 --> 29:08.225
But I stayed empty.

29:10.007 --> 29:11.359
I was empty.

29:13.054 --> 29:15.631
And I put that emptiness on my family.

29:17.902 --> 29:21.437
If you can't even understand
the value of things,

29:21.472 --> 29:24.006
then how can you understand
the value of people?

29:25.677 --> 29:28.377
I couldn't help myself.
I was a slave to wanting.

29:28.413 --> 29:30.479
I mean, that's the truth.

29:30.515 --> 29:33.716
Debt is slavery. Credit is slavery.

29:33.751 --> 29:35.351
Preach!

29:35.386 --> 29:39.355
That's their way... to
be greedy and selfish.

29:40.169 --> 29:42.403
That's how they live.

29:42.438 --> 29:44.505
That's what they teach their children.

29:44.540 --> 29:47.274
"Buy this, buy that, have this, have that."

29:47.310 --> 29:48.642
Yeah.

29:48.678 --> 29:53.514
But when you live like that,
when you live like they live,

29:53.549 --> 29:56.250
that's when you can feel it in your heart.

29:56.285 --> 29:59.153
You can feel your heart
closing down on you.

30:02.892 --> 30:08.062
But when I learned to
start doing for others,

30:08.097 --> 30:11.432
I dedicated myself to uplifting us.

30:14.054 --> 30:16.788
When I gave myself to our true god...

30:16.823 --> 30:20.491
Our one, true god, Allah...

30:20.527 --> 30:23.728
That's when I finally found my freedom.

30:23.763 --> 30:26.664
The sky was truly blue.
The temperature was right.

30:26.700 --> 30:27.999
Yeah.

30:29.469 --> 30:31.536
I'm grateful for my freedom.

30:33.506 --> 30:37.041
And... I want freedom for all of us.

30:41.806 --> 30:44.006
I know you're not on good
terms with your husband,

30:44.041 --> 30:45.941
but you have to sit next to him, okay?

30:45.977 --> 30:48.544
- I can do that. My son is here, too.
- Good.

30:48.579 --> 30:50.679
The three of you need to show the judge

30:50.715 --> 30:52.281
what kind of family you are...

30:52.316 --> 30:54.883
Good people with strong family values.

30:54.919 --> 30:57.653
You want to wear a dress
or a skirt and a blouse

30:57.688 --> 31:00.389
with classic lines and your true colors.

31:00.424 --> 31:02.358
Don't wear a suit. It's too severe.

31:02.393 --> 31:05.594
You're there as a mother.

31:05.630 --> 31:07.363
It makes a difference.

31:07.398 --> 31:09.465
Did it for you?

31:13.270 --> 31:17.606
My daughter's killer was a monster,

31:17.642 --> 31:19.241
someone who had been
violent his whole life,

31:19.276 --> 31:21.644
never had a job, never finished school.

31:21.679 --> 31:23.746
On the first day of his trial,

31:23.781 --> 31:26.181
he showed up wearing glasses,

31:27.380 --> 31:28.979
and he didn't even know how to read.

31:29.015 --> 31:31.715
Was he black? No, he was white.

31:31.751 --> 31:33.017
He wore a suit and tie.

31:33.052 --> 31:35.786
He... he looked like a college student.

31:35.822 --> 31:37.555
And his lawyer told all these stories,

31:37.590 --> 31:39.190
all these sad, sad stories

31:39.225 --> 31:41.125
about how he'd been abused as a child.

31:41.160 --> 31:45.162
He'd never had a chance at a real...

31:45.187 --> 31:48.074
I went out and bought... a blue dress

31:48.099 --> 31:49.532
that I thought would make me feel

31:49.567 --> 31:51.968
the opposite of what I was feeling...

31:52.003 --> 31:56.806
Confident... because I wanted
to be strong for my daughter.

31:56.841 --> 32:01.511
But the defense painted
this picture of me...

32:01.546 --> 32:04.747
As this... cold woman.

32:04.783 --> 32:06.849
That's... anyone can see that's...

32:06.885 --> 32:10.419
I know. I know. I'm not
saying it to make you...

32:10.455 --> 32:15.811
The defense made it
sound like it was my fault

32:15.836 --> 32:17.994
that my daughter had been killed.

32:18.029 --> 32:19.936
And the jury looked at her killer

32:19.961 --> 32:23.199
in his suit and glasses
and felt sorry for him.

32:24.009 --> 32:25.442
And the press kept writing

32:25.477 --> 32:29.947
about this cold woman in her blue dress.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.786
So I lost that battle.

32:35.821 --> 32:39.056
All I can do is pass on
to you what I've learned.

32:39.091 --> 32:41.992
These things do matter.

33:14.180 --> 33:16.748
When Carter Nix was first arraigned,

33:16.783 --> 33:19.650
he was remanded based
on the alleged strength

33:19.686 --> 33:22.720
of the people's case, and
now we see that their case

33:22.756 --> 33:25.089
is not nearly as strong as they portrayed.

33:25.125 --> 33:28.960
In fact, since this court
denied my client bail,

33:28.995 --> 33:31.419
we have found out a few things.

33:31.444 --> 33:35.299
The gun found on my client
was not the murder weapon.

33:35.335 --> 33:37.235
The semen found on Mrs. Skokie

33:37.270 --> 33:40.505
does not match the semen of my client.

33:40.540 --> 33:44.242
The truth is... Mrs.
Skokie wasn't raped at all,

33:44.277 --> 33:48.464
but had consensual sex with
men other than her husband.

33:48.489 --> 33:50.753
Another change in circumstances

33:50.778 --> 33:53.933
was the discovery of a
sellable amount of drugs

33:53.958 --> 33:56.069
found in Mr. and Mrs. Skokie's home.

33:56.104 --> 33:57.770
"Sellable" is a reach, Your Honor.

33:57.806 --> 34:00.840
What would you call it,
then? A lifetime supply?

34:00.876 --> 34:04.852
Mr. Skokie had no record of
drug dealing or anything else.

34:04.877 --> 34:06.892
There were strangers in
the house, Your Honor.

34:06.917 --> 34:09.166
Mr. and Mrs. Skokie's activities

34:09.190 --> 34:11.114
brought a criminal element into their home.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.344
That's speculation at its worst, counselor.

34:13.369 --> 34:15.203
You have no proof, no police
reports, no witness testimony.

34:15.239 --> 34:18.974
I ask for a complete dismissal
of all charges, Your Honor.

34:19.009 --> 34:20.275
Your Honor, we have a witness

34:20.311 --> 34:22.377
that puts the defendant
at the scene of the crime.

34:22.413 --> 34:26.114
After which, he returns with
the murder victim's wallet.

34:26.150 --> 34:29.184
Well, I'm not going to dismiss the charges.

34:29.219 --> 34:30.552
The people's case remains compelling

34:30.588 --> 34:33.621
and deserves to move forward
to preliminary examination.

34:33.657 --> 34:37.826
However, the proof of Mr.
Nix's guilt is not as evident

34:37.860 --> 34:40.762
as when the court determined
bail was not appropriate.

34:40.797 --> 34:43.831
Therefore, I am setting bail at $1 million

34:43.867 --> 34:46.156
with a fully collateralized bond,

34:46.181 --> 34:49.043
plus pre-trial monitoring by
the department of probations,

34:49.068 --> 34:51.696
including but not limited
to ankle monitoring.

35:09.126 --> 35:11.393
When, uh, Brother Timothy
said "lifetime supply,"

35:11.427 --> 35:13.527
oh, my...

35:13.563 --> 35:17.298
Look at them... with their
head scarves... celebrating.

35:20.930 --> 35:22.546
You people have no right

35:22.571 --> 35:24.312
talking about my son like that.

35:24.337 --> 35:25.953
He was a good man, and you
can all just go to hell!

35:25.978 --> 35:26.978
Mom!

35:29.848 --> 35:32.916
I made it worse...

35:32.930 --> 35:34.730
- It's all right.
- They're not gonna write about that?

35:34.766 --> 35:36.899
They're not gonna write about
me yelling and being hysterical,

35:36.934 --> 35:39.568
all of them standing there,
laughing and grinning?

35:40.425 --> 35:42.323
You said what you felt.

35:42.348 --> 35:44.948
That isn't me. I don't lose myself.

35:44.973 --> 35:47.862
I'm controlled. I can control...

35:51.102 --> 35:54.237
Would you... would you
take him away from here?

35:54.272 --> 35:56.906
Yeah, of course. I don't
want to walk out with him.

36:08.475 --> 36:11.384
You're working so hard, sweetheart.

36:11.409 --> 36:13.643
Daddy and I are proud of you.

36:13.678 --> 36:16.122
We're here for you.

36:16.147 --> 36:18.341
We'll always be here for you.

36:18.366 --> 36:19.799
She didn't love us.

36:19.834 --> 36:21.567
- She humored us.
- Don't.

36:21.603 --> 36:22.869
She tolerated us.

36:22.904 --> 36:25.271
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

36:25.306 --> 36:27.373
This isn't about you.

36:27.409 --> 36:29.442
That is not the girl we raised.

36:29.477 --> 36:32.761
She is our child. She
will always be our child.

36:32.786 --> 36:37.088
And I won't abandon her now
when she needs us the most.

36:38.734 --> 36:40.748
What has happened to you?

36:42.180 --> 36:44.090
I read the police file.

36:46.548 --> 36:49.852
The men whose semen was found inside her...

36:49.887 --> 36:51.453
The police talked to them... you did that?!

36:51.489 --> 36:53.088
And they went into great
detail about what...

36:53.124 --> 36:55.191
How could you invade her
privacy?! How could you do that?!

36:55.226 --> 36:56.881
Because one of us has to be realistic.

36:56.906 --> 36:58.835
You are not being realistic.

36:58.860 --> 37:02.809
Gwen is not normal... not sexually, no.

37:02.834 --> 37:04.767
- It doesn't matter!
- She has problems.

37:04.802 --> 37:07.536
My god, yes, I know she has problems.

37:07.572 --> 37:08.871
I know she needs help,

37:08.906 --> 37:10.973
but I'm not gonna sit here
and argue about her sex life

37:11.008 --> 37:12.368
when, my god, we don't even know...

37:12.376 --> 37:14.443
What's going on here?
Were you guys touching her?

37:14.478 --> 37:15.911
What? No.

37:15.947 --> 37:17.546
No. What's the matter?

37:17.582 --> 37:19.148
Her heart rate started racing.

37:19.183 --> 37:21.584
- Is she all right?
- What... what does that mean?

37:21.619 --> 37:24.934
Page Dr... Page Dr. Parks to room 203.

37:24.959 --> 37:26.725
What... what's wrong?

37:26.761 --> 37:28.326
Uh, the doctor might want
to give her a sedative.

37:28.351 --> 37:30.185
Sedative? She's in a coma.

37:30.210 --> 37:33.031
Yeah, well, if she wasn't
responding to physical stimuli,

37:33.067 --> 37:35.167
then she was responding to
something you were saying.

37:35.202 --> 37:37.436
She's waking up.

38:09.170 --> 38:11.403
No! No! No!

38:14.608 --> 38:16.041
No.

38:16.076 --> 38:20.535
Guard! Aah! Guard!

38:20.560 --> 38:22.794
No! Guard!

38:22.829 --> 38:25.196
Guard! Help!

38:25.231 --> 38:26.998
What do you mean, you'll
get the bail money?

38:27.033 --> 38:29.100
By the mercy of Allah.

38:29.135 --> 38:31.468
A $100,000 bond?

38:31.493 --> 38:33.110
Where are you gonna get
that kind of cash from?

38:33.135 --> 38:35.495
- I have it.
- How?

38:35.530 --> 38:38.565
I had some in savings,
and then I took out a loan.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.334
And for the rest, I took
a collection at the temple.

38:41.369 --> 38:44.704
The people came together, and
they gave from their hearts.

38:44.739 --> 38:47.073
Them people don't know me.

38:47.108 --> 38:50.143
If you're known by Allah,
then you're known by us.

38:50.178 --> 38:52.445
Your freedom is so close.

38:52.480 --> 38:55.682
So pay the money. Get
me the hell out of here.

38:55.717 --> 38:58.108
If you're willing to accept our freedom,

38:58.133 --> 39:00.273
then you have to be willing
to accept what comes with it.

39:00.298 --> 39:02.732
I told you before... I'm
not begging you for anything.

39:02.767 --> 39:05.167
What's happening here is bigger than you.

39:05.203 --> 39:08.437
This is about every black
man who cannot get justice.

39:08.473 --> 39:10.548
You need to represent.

39:10.573 --> 39:14.002
You need to be the voice for
people who do not have a voice.

39:17.312 --> 39:19.955
And you need to stay away from that girl.

39:21.483 --> 39:24.218
Look, Aubry... she's not
what you're saying she is.

39:24.253 --> 39:25.852
She's bad for you.

39:25.888 --> 39:28.121
And unless you're able to admit
it and turn away from her...

39:28.157 --> 39:31.091
- Look, you don't understand.
- I have been there, Carter.

39:32.133 --> 39:33.583
I failed myself.

39:33.608 --> 39:35.060
I failed other people.

39:35.085 --> 39:37.193
I love her.

39:40.180 --> 39:42.443
You can hate whitey all you want.

39:43.078 --> 39:45.645
Aubry... I love her.

39:48.450 --> 39:50.820
This is not a negotiation.

39:50.845 --> 39:53.608
It's a condition.

39:53.633 --> 39:56.679
I understand more than you think.

39:57.692 --> 40:01.427
And once you've elevated
yourself, you'll thank me.

40:13.456 --> 40:18.278
I don't think you can
imagine how unhappy Gwen was,

40:20.281 --> 40:22.815
how she... she was driven
to do things with men.

40:25.351 --> 40:28.061
Well, she was in a bad situation.

40:28.086 --> 40:30.281
Yeah, but when?

40:31.008 --> 40:32.892
When was it bad? When
she was with your brother?

40:34.153 --> 40:36.120
Or when she was with us?

40:37.998 --> 40:42.393
This, um... this story that my mom tells

40:42.428 --> 40:47.798
about my brother signing up
after 9/11, being a hero...

40:47.834 --> 40:50.768
It's not true.

40:50.803 --> 40:53.037
Matt was doing drugs and selling drugs

40:53.072 --> 40:55.473
even back then.

40:55.508 --> 40:57.108
And mom didn't know what to do with him,

40:57.143 --> 41:00.711
so... she made him enlist.

41:00.747 --> 41:03.481
She was the one that put him in the army.

41:03.516 --> 41:05.917
- He didn't want to go.
- Why are you telling me this?

41:05.952 --> 41:07.885
Because you need to know.

41:07.921 --> 41:11.155
These lies... it's... it's all my mom has.

41:12.225 --> 41:16.552
Her husband split on her. Her son's dead.

41:18.718 --> 41:20.960
All she has left is a fantasy.

41:20.999 --> 41:22.766
You want me to feel sorry for her?

41:22.801 --> 41:25.368
I want you to look at my family

41:25.404 --> 41:28.071
and see us for the freak show that we are.

41:31.043 --> 41:34.077
And I want you to do better than us.

41:34.112 --> 41:36.546
I should never have looked at those files.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.848
No. I had no business reading...

41:38.884 --> 41:40.183
The only thing that matters

41:40.218 --> 41:44.621
is that Gwen has a real shot at surviving.

41:46.058 --> 41:47.390
So if it's all right, um,

41:47.426 --> 41:49.793
I want to stick around and...

41:53.065 --> 41:58.034
Try and see if I can be of use somehow.

41:58.070 --> 42:00.036
My family's busted up.

42:00.072 --> 42:03.707
It's never gonna get fixed.

42:03.742 --> 42:06.309
But you... Gwen, and Eve...
