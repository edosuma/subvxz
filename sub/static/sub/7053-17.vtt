When objects from the other Universe

00:05.535 --> 00:08.337
Cross to our side,
they have an energy.

00:08.405 --> 00:09.872
A woman described it
as a glimmer.

00:09.940 --> 00:10.906
How can I see it?

00:10.974 --> 00:12.274
The cortexiphan trials.

00:12.342 --> 00:14.610
I was part of the trials
when I was a kid.

00:14.678 --> 00:16.712
It was a highly
experimental drug.

00:16.780 --> 00:18.881
It might enhance
certain abilities

00:18.949 --> 00:20.883
In predisposed children.

00:20.951 --> 00:22.117
I've never met anyone

00:22.185 --> 00:24.920
Who can do the things
that you do.

00:24.988 --> 00:27.823
I'll go get my coat.

00:27.891 --> 00:29.158
Please don't tell him.

00:37.968 --> 00:39.468
You sure you don't
want some soup?

00:39.536 --> 00:41.103
Tea or coffee?
To warm you up?

00:41.171 --> 00:42.137
<i>No, thank you.</i>

00:42.205 --> 00:46.442
I have trouble
keeping anything down.

00:46.509 --> 00:49.278
Your office told me
how busy you are.

00:49.346 --> 00:51.280
I really appreciate
you coming.

00:51.348 --> 00:52.915
I'm sorry.

00:52.983 --> 00:54.950
I keep trying
to remember you.

00:55.018 --> 00:56.418
I understand.

00:56.486 --> 00:58.420
It was a long time ago.

00:58.488 --> 01:00.656
We were just kids.

01:00.724 --> 01:03.959
So is that when you think
you were exposed to something?

01:04.027 --> 01:07.630
I've seen about
a half dozen doctors,

01:07.697 --> 01:09.632
Specialists.

01:09.699 --> 01:12.268
<i>They think it's the only
explanation that makes sense.</i>

01:12.335 --> 01:16.305
Well,
maybe I can help you.

01:16.373 --> 01:20.042
<i>Look, I'm grateful
you're doing this,</i>

01:20.110 --> 01:22.344
But that's not why
I asked to see you.

01:22.412 --> 01:24.647
I wasn't looking
to make money.

01:24.714 --> 01:26.682
Of course.
I understand.

01:26.750 --> 01:29.451
But if someone's responsible
for your illness,

01:29.519 --> 01:30.653
My firm can absolutely help--

01:30.720 --> 01:32.488
The last doctor I saw,

01:32.555 --> 01:35.057
He suggested
that if I could find

01:35.125 --> 01:36.125
Some of the other kids

01:36.192 --> 01:37.126
We went to school with...

01:37.193 --> 01:38.127
Uh-huh.

01:38.194 --> 01:39.995
If some of them
have the same symptoms,

01:40.063 --> 01:41.463
It might help him identify

01:41.531 --> 01:43.065
What it is
that's making me sick.

01:43.133 --> 01:44.900
I'm sorry.

01:44.968 --> 01:48.170
I--I really don't
remember names.

01:48.238 --> 01:51.640
<i>Uh, it's so long ago.</i>

01:51.708 --> 01:53.375
<i>You know what?</i>

01:53.443 --> 01:57.079
I do remember one boy.

01:57.147 --> 02:01.917
Um, lloyd,
um, lloyd becker.

02:01.985 --> 02:04.320
He made me eat a bug
on the playground.

02:04.387 --> 02:06.221
<i>I remember him.</i>

02:06.289 --> 02:08.657

02:10.426 --> 02:11.927

05:04.333 --> 05:07.468
You said that...

05:07.536 --> 05:12.307

05:12.374 --> 05:15.043

I can tell you

05:41.904 --> 05:44.005

life and death.

<i>Hey, dunham.</i>

You know,
one of the few I know.

06:47.002 --> 06:49.871
<i>If you agreed
to keep this secret,</i>

06:49.938 --> 06:53.174
I'm sure you had
a good reason.

Yeah.

<i>(peter)

they just had
a fresh snowfall.

07:05.421 --> 07:07.955
I had no idea
you were a skier.

07:08.023 --> 07:09.290
Oh, yes.

07:09.358 --> 07:11.559
I was quite a hotdogger.

07:11.627 --> 07:15.396
I remember there was
this secret trail.

07:15.464 --> 07:17.198
They called it
"the backside,"

07:17.266 --> 07:19.300
But not for the reason
you would think.

07:19.368 --> 07:20.902
It was a nude ski run.

07:20.969 --> 07:23.204
By the time you got down
to the bottom,

07:23.272 --> 07:25.506
Your testicles
would be in your mouth.

07:25.574 --> 07:28.776
I'm sure agent dunham
is very thankful for that image.

07:28.844 --> 07:30.712
<i>Walter's advocating
a father-son trip.</i>

07:30.779 --> 07:32.046
And I'm sure agent dunham

07:32.114 --> 07:34.615
Is not interested in that.

07:34.683 --> 07:38.286
I understand that
agent broyles

07:38.354 --> 07:40.388
Has a body
for us to look at.

07:40.456 --> 07:42.190
Her name is miranda greene.

07:42.257 --> 07:43.691
30 years old, unmarried.

07:43.759 --> 07:44.692
She was an attorney.

07:44.760 --> 07:45.693
Lived here in providence.

07:45.761 --> 07:47.829
Emts responded to a 911 call

07:47.896 --> 07:49.263
Phoned in
by a good samaritan.

07:49.331 --> 07:51.833
She was dead
by the time they arrived.

07:51.900 --> 07:55.336
Doctor.

07:55.404 --> 07:56.771
This is
agent olivia dunham,

<i>This is peter bishop,
and doctor--</i>

Walter bishop.

08:00.809 --> 08:02.477
John potash.

08:02.544 --> 08:05.179
I took your advanced
biochem seminar, dr. Bishop.

08:05.247 --> 08:08.216
Oh.
Oh, I apologize.

08:08.283 --> 08:11.419
I remember I was
a bit of a slave driver.

08:11.487 --> 08:12.620
You were.

08:12.688 --> 08:14.288
But also inspiring.

08:14.356 --> 08:18.626
The truth is I was
considering changing majors,

08:18.694 --> 08:22.063
But you encouraged me to stick
with it and become a doctor.

08:22.131 --> 08:23.831
I never thought I'd get
a chance to thank you.

08:23.899 --> 08:26.634
Your father
is a great man.

08:26.702 --> 08:30.738
Doctor, um, which one
is miranda greene?

08:30.806 --> 08:34.107
Ah, um, right this way.

08:34.176 --> 08:36.878
<i>I'm sorry. This might be
a bit unpleasant.</i>

08:36.945 --> 08:39.113
Ah.

08:39.181 --> 08:40.982
Epidermal blistering.

08:41.049 --> 08:43.551
<i>Tissue necrosis.</i>

08:43.619 --> 08:47.088
Symptomatic of cytotoxins.

08:47.156 --> 08:49.824
Could you get a sample
of this pus please, peter?

08:49.892 --> 08:51.692
I always
get the good jobs.

08:51.760 --> 08:52.860
According to her coworkers,

08:52.928 --> 08:54.562
When she left for lunch,
she was perfectly fine.

08:54.630 --> 08:55.830
She hadn't mentioned
any signs of illness.

08:55.898 --> 08:59.167
<i>That was about two hours
before the 911 call.</i>

08:59.234 --> 09:01.002
Uh, I was considering
that these are contact burns

09:01.069 --> 09:04.138
<i>From some sort
of synthetic chemical.</i>

09:04.206 --> 09:05.673
<i>No, these aren't
chemical burns.</i>

09:05.741 --> 09:08.075
[chuckles]

09:08.143 --> 09:11.012
They look more like
malignant tumors.

09:11.079 --> 09:12.346
Cancer?

09:12.414 --> 09:14.582
Sarcomas, to be exact.

09:14.650 --> 09:16.551
<i>But that kind of cancer</i>

09:16.618 --> 09:18.553
Presents beneath the skin,
not on the surface.

09:18.620 --> 09:19.854
Normally, yes.

09:19.922 --> 09:22.490
Do you have a black light?

09:22.558 --> 09:24.892
Yeah. Somewhere.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.194
What is it, walter?

09:26.261 --> 09:27.662
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

09:27.729 --> 09:30.598
<i>Cancers always start</i>

09:30.666 --> 09:31.899
With a specific
point of origin,

09:31.967 --> 09:34.669
And they spread
from there, so...

09:34.736 --> 09:35.903
Hmm? Ah.

09:35.971 --> 09:37.405
<i>Here you go.</i>

09:37.473 --> 09:39.373
<i>Agent broyles,
lights, please.</i>

09:39.441 --> 09:40.575
<i>Oh.</i>

09:40.642 --> 09:45.213
The cells near the point
of origin of the cancer

09:45.280 --> 09:47.114
Should show more progression,

09:47.182 --> 09:50.451
And hence refract
a different color.

09:52.387 --> 09:53.688
<i>Oh.</i>

09:53.755 --> 09:57.058
<i>Like that.</i>

09:58.760 --> 09:59.827
It looks like...

09:59.895 --> 10:01.028
Fingers.

10:01.096 --> 10:03.931
<i>Huh. Indeed.</i>

10:03.999 --> 10:05.466
Right hand, I'd say.

10:05.534 --> 10:11.239
Which indicates not only
what killed this woman,

10:11.306 --> 10:13.007
But also who.

10:13.075 --> 10:15.376
<i>Of course, somehow</i>

10:15.444 --> 10:16.677
<i>We'll need
to retrieve a print.</i>

10:16.745 --> 10:17.778
<i>Dr. Bishop,</i>

10:17.846 --> 10:20.147
What you're suggesting
is impossible--

10:20.215 --> 10:22.383
That someone
touched this woman

10:22.451 --> 10:23.985
And gave her cancer?

10:24.052 --> 10:26.287
<i>It seems you've forgotten
my very first lesson, doctor.</i>

10:26.355 --> 10:30.591
When you open your mind
to the impossible,

10:30.659 --> 10:33.194
Sometimes you
find the truth.

10:41.129 --> 10:43.664
<i>And they're predicting
snow next week.</i>

10:43.732 --> 10:46.133
Hardly ideal beach weather.

10:46.201 --> 10:47.634
Why are you going
to atlantic city?

10:47.702 --> 10:49.903
I was thinking
of taking peter there.

10:49.971 --> 10:53.807
Used to love
saltwater taffy as a child.

10:53.875 --> 10:55.943
So what are we
looking for?

10:56.011 --> 10:58.612
Why are we cutting off
this poor woman's arm?

10:58.680 --> 11:00.614
The handprint shows

11:00.682 --> 11:05.185
An extraordinary level
of cellular detail.

11:06.688 --> 11:08.422
I'm hoping...

11:12.027 --> 11:14.828
Hoping to be able
to remove the tumor, and...

11:14.896 --> 11:17.664
Bake the skin, and...

11:17.732 --> 11:20.401
Hopefully identify
a fingerprint.

11:20.468 --> 11:22.736
Oh, and I'll need
two hot baths and an oven.

11:22.804 --> 11:25.005
You really think
someone may have touched her

11:25.073 --> 11:26.507
And given her cancer?

11:26.574 --> 11:27.508
Terrifying possibility,

11:27.575 --> 11:29.576
But a possibility
nonetheless.

11:29.644 --> 11:30.778
[saw whirs]

11:30.845 --> 11:34.882
Oh. We need glycerin,
corn starch,

11:34.949 --> 11:36.350
And food coloring.

11:36.418 --> 11:37.651
Food coloring?

11:37.719 --> 11:38.652
Well, not for her,

11:38.720 --> 11:39.653
But since we're baking,

11:39.721 --> 11:40.854
We may as well
make some taffy.

11:40.922 --> 11:43.490
[saw whirs]

11:43.558 --> 11:45.592
<i>(man)
I've worked with miranda
for about seven years.</i>

11:45.660 --> 11:46.794
She was fairly private,

11:46.861 --> 11:49.196
But if she was sick,
I think someone would know.

11:49.264 --> 11:50.364
So what sort of cases

11:50.432 --> 11:52.366
Did Miranda usually
work on, Mr. Messing?

11:52.434 --> 11:53.967
Mostly toxic tort
litigation.

11:54.035 --> 11:55.169
Mm-hmm.
Class action stuff.

11:55.236 --> 11:56.970
Asbestos,
lead poisoning.

11:57.038 --> 11:58.338
She had a real thing

11:58.406 --> 12:01.642
About protecting those who
couldn't protect themselves.

12:01.709 --> 12:04.778
And is this
what she was working on?

12:04.846 --> 12:06.213
Yeah.

12:06.281 --> 12:09.516
She was prepping a case against
intrepus pharmaceuticals.

12:09.584 --> 12:12.152
Trial was supposed
to start next week.

12:12.220 --> 12:15.422
Hmm. How much money
was at stake in the trial?

12:15.490 --> 12:17.224
North eight figures.

12:20.862 --> 12:23.130
Wait, are you
suggesting that--

12:23.198 --> 12:25.232
That someone
did this to her?

12:25.300 --> 12:27.501
I thought she contracted
some kind of crazy disease.

12:27.569 --> 12:29.803
<i>Well, we're not sure,
but we like to be thorough.</i>

12:29.871 --> 12:32.639
Can we take her files
on the intrepus case?

12:32.707 --> 12:34.908
Uh, of course. Yeah.

12:34.976 --> 12:36.243
Miss greene
had a bunch of meetings

12:36.311 --> 12:37.277
Scheduled for yesterday.

12:37.345 --> 12:38.479
Do you recognize
any of those names?

12:38.546 --> 12:41.515
First two
are deposition prep.

12:41.583 --> 12:44.084
I don't recognize
the third one.

12:44.152 --> 12:47.321
Neil wilson.

12:47.388 --> 12:48.789
She was supposed to meet him

12:48.857 --> 12:53.293
About an hour
before she died.

12:53.361 --> 12:54.495
Do you really think that
intrepus pharmaceutical

12:54.562 --> 12:55.496
Killed this woman?

12:55.563 --> 12:57.598
Maybe. You don't?

12:57.665 --> 12:58.699
I've never heard of a drug

12:58.766 --> 13:00.334
That can cause what happened
to miranda greene.

13:00.401 --> 13:02.703
<i>It just seems like an awful
lot of trouble to go through</i>

13:02.770 --> 13:03.770
To kill somebody.

13:03.838 --> 13:05.005
Why not just hire a hit man?

13:05.073 --> 13:07.274
Well, a hit man would draw
too much attention.

13:07.342 --> 13:09.543
Really? And spontaneous,
fatal tumor-growth wouldn't?

13:09.611 --> 13:13.614
I suppose
you have a point.

13:20.855 --> 13:22.189
You want to come on inside,
we can noodle on it?

13:22.257 --> 13:24.424
<i>Maybe order a pizza?</i>

13:24.492 --> 13:25.559
Uh, thanks, but, no.

13:25.627 --> 13:26.660
I didn't get
much sleep last night,

13:26.728 --> 13:27.895
So I should probably
head home.

13:27.962 --> 13:30.164
Anyway, I'm not
really hungry, but, um...

13:30.231 --> 13:33.667
All right.
Thank you.

13:57.291 --> 13:59.025
Oh, agent dunham.

13:59.093 --> 14:00.794
You're up early.

14:00.861 --> 14:01.962
Yeah.

14:02.029 --> 14:04.264
I ran
Neil Wilson's number.

14:04.332 --> 14:05.632
It's a disposable
cell phone,

14:05.700 --> 14:07.200
And it was
deactivated yesterday.

14:07.268 --> 14:08.535
It's a pretty common name.

14:08.603 --> 14:10.537
I checked, and there's
more than 50 neil wilsons

14:10.605 --> 14:11.638
In the tri-state area.

14:11.706 --> 14:13.607
Do you want me to start
running them down?

14:13.674 --> 14:15.041
Oh, no.

14:15.109 --> 14:19.446
I'm pretty sure he gave her
a fake name anyway, so...

14:19.513 --> 14:21.348
Astrid, could you give
walter and I a minute?

14:21.415 --> 14:23.483
Sure.

14:23.551 --> 14:26.786
Walter,
don't mix up the spoons.

14:29.690 --> 14:30.957
Agent dunham.

14:31.025 --> 14:32.525
Help me stir.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.001
Walter, I have to tell him.

14:41.068 --> 14:42.435
I got to tell peter the truth.

14:42.503 --> 14:46.006
But that's not
what we discussed.

14:46.073 --> 14:48.308
I know, and I'm sorry.

14:48.376 --> 14:49.709
But he deserves
to know the truth

14:49.777 --> 14:50.710
About who he is.

14:50.778 --> 14:53.179
No.
No, you don't understand.

14:53.247 --> 14:55.482
Things have never
been better between us.

14:55.549 --> 14:56.916
I can't lose him again.

14:56.984 --> 14:57.917
I can't.

14:57.985 --> 14:58.918
You won't.

14:58.986 --> 15:00.920
Once he knows
the whole story.

15:00.988 --> 15:03.823
Walter,
you saved his life.

15:03.891 --> 15:05.592
I'm sure that he
will understand.

15:05.660 --> 15:07.293
No, he won't.

15:07.361 --> 15:09.996
He will never forgive me.

15:12.366 --> 15:14.534
I--I have to tell him.

15:14.602 --> 15:16.102
If it was
the other way around,

15:16.170 --> 15:17.303
I would want him to tell me.

15:17.371 --> 15:18.304
I'm begging you.

15:18.372 --> 15:19.539
Not yet. Please.

15:19.607 --> 15:21.741
Give me time to prepare.

15:23.678 --> 15:25.278
Please.

15:34.088 --> 15:35.021
Hey.
[cell phone rings]

15:35.089 --> 15:36.356
I didn't realize
you were coming.

15:36.424 --> 15:37.457
I would have
got you one too.

15:37.525 --> 15:40.794

15:42.096 --> 15:43.530
<i>Tall, nonfat,

15:43.597 --> 15:46.766
Just the way you like it.

15:49.036 --> 15:50.804
Uh, miranda greene
used her credit card

15:50.871 --> 15:52.005
At a downtown providence cafe

15:52.073 --> 15:54.340
<i>About a half hour
before she died.</i>

15:54.408 --> 15:56.009
Sounds like her meeting
with neil wilson.

15:56.077 --> 15:57.977
Excellent.
Well, I'm up for a road trip.

15:58.045 --> 15:59.312
How about you?

16:08.756 --> 16:10.490
<i>I remember her.</i>

16:10.558 --> 16:11.558
<i>Pretty lady.</i>

16:11.625 --> 16:12.726

16:12.793 --> 16:15.361
She's a lawyer, right?
Yeah.

16:15.429 --> 16:17.130
Do you happen to remember
if she was with anyone

16:17.198 --> 16:18.398
The last time
that she was here?

16:18.466 --> 16:20.033
Some guy.

16:20.101 --> 16:21.634
She was taking
all sorts of notes.

16:21.702 --> 16:23.937
What, does she sue doctors
or something?

16:24.004 --> 16:25.405
Excuse me?

16:25.473 --> 16:26.673
Well, the guy she was with,

16:26.741 --> 16:27.874
He looked real pale and skinny.

16:27.942 --> 16:29.943
Dark circles under his eyes.

16:30.010 --> 16:31.144
You think he was sick?

16:31.212 --> 16:32.345
<i>I'd say pretty bad.</i>

16:32.413 --> 16:34.981
Looked my uncle did
when he was fighting cancer.

16:38.152 --> 16:39.385
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

16:39.453 --> 16:42.055
Well, I'm thinking that
cancer isn't contagious.

16:42.123 --> 16:44.124
Well, it wouldn't be
the strangest thing we've seen.

16:44.191 --> 16:46.159
But it would be close.

18:24.569 --> 18:26.570
<i>(olivia)

Miranda greene had lunch with
someone just before she died

18:29.674 --> 18:31.542
With--with a man
that may have had cancer.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.510
Does that suggest
anything to you?

18:33.578 --> 18:36.013
Cancer isn't contagious,
of course.

18:36.081 --> 18:37.481
That's what I said.

18:37.549 --> 18:38.649
<i>Although...</i>

18:42.020 --> 18:45.155
Are you familiar with
the chinese notion of ch'I,

Agent dunham?

18:46.224 --> 18:47.224
No.

Dim mak.

The touch ofeath.

18:49.761 --> 18:50.928
<i>Exactly.</i>

18:50.996 --> 18:52.496
<i>The chinese believe</i>

18:52.564 --> 18:54.431
That all living creatures

18:54.499 --> 18:57.134
Contain an energy,
our ch'I,

18:57.202 --> 18:58.836
And, that with proper training,

18:58.904 --> 19:02.840
A simple touch
can affect their ch'I.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.975
Reverse it.

19:05.043 --> 19:08.746
Can cause sickness,
even death.

19:08.813 --> 19:10.014
Except, of course,
they can't.

19:10.081 --> 19:12.049
'cause the touch of death
is just a legend.

19:12.117 --> 19:14.385
Of course, what would be
more interesting

19:14.452 --> 19:17.254
Wouldn't be a transfer
of energy,

19:17.322 --> 19:18.656
But an exchange.

19:18.723 --> 19:20.391
Meaning what?

19:20.458 --> 19:21.392
This other man,

19:21.459 --> 19:23.727
You say that he was sick too,

19:23.795 --> 19:25.596
That he had cancer
as well?
Possibly.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.131
And at the time she met him,

19:27.198 --> 19:29.166
Miss greene
was perfectly healthy.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.734
Yes.

19:30.802 --> 19:32.336
Then I suggest
what we're looking at here

19:32.404 --> 19:34.271
Adheres more closely
to tantric sex.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.706
Sex?

19:35.774 --> 19:37.441
<i>Yes.</i>

19:37.509 --> 19:39.076
<i>Insofar as the goal
of tantric sex</i>

19:39.144 --> 19:41.345
Is a heightened
state of perception,

19:41.413 --> 19:42.813
Of awareness.

19:42.881 --> 19:44.481
<i>The partners
are not interested</i>

19:44.549 --> 19:46.750
Merely in
the sexual experience.

19:46.818 --> 19:50.254
They are seeking
an exchange of energy.

have to do with miranda greene?

That's a fine deduction,

22:27.879 --> 22:30.247
This...This...

22:30.315 --> 22:33.884
Uh, little family unit
that we've got going...

22:35.987 --> 22:38.856
I don't want to do anything
to jeopardize that.

22:41.192 --> 22:42.726
I don't either.

22:42.794 --> 22:47.231
Okay,
so we're good then, right?

22:47.298 --> 22:50.701
Yeah.

22:50.768 --> 22:53.604
Good.

22:57.008 --> 22:58.008
I found more victims.

22:58.076 --> 23:00.110
Five deaths over
the past 20 months,

23:00.178 --> 23:01.979
From chicago to hartford.

23:02.046 --> 23:07.451
Each person died from the same
kind of rapid onset cancer.

23:07.519 --> 23:09.319
And healthy people
keeling over like this

23:09.387 --> 23:11.054
Didn't set off
any alarm bells?

23:11.122 --> 23:13.223
Well, a couple were
considered medical anomalies,

23:13.291 --> 23:14.825
And local police
looked into another,

23:14.893 --> 23:16.593
But nothing suggested
it was murder.

23:16.661 --> 23:19.863
So what is it
about these people

23:19.931 --> 23:21.365
That's making them targets?

23:21.432 --> 23:23.634
Astrid, we need to
cross-reference their files,

23:23.701 --> 23:26.503
See if we can find
what they may have in common.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.906
All right. I'm on it.

23:28.973 --> 23:32.910
Timothy ober.

23:32.977 --> 23:35.646
Is his middle name michael?

23:35.713 --> 23:39.416
Um, yeah.

23:39.484 --> 23:41.818
Timothy michael ober.

23:41.886 --> 23:43.020
Why? You know him?

23:43.087 --> 23:46.657
<i>How?</i>

23:46.724 --> 23:50.027
I don't know.

24:14.747 --> 24:17.282
[knock on door]

24:39.739 --> 24:41.807
What's up, buttercup?

24:41.875 --> 24:43.308
It's past midnight.

24:43.376 --> 24:47.112
Do you feel
like playing a game?

24:47.180 --> 24:48.647
Clue?

24:48.715 --> 24:50.883
Yeah.

24:50.950 --> 24:52.551
I thought it might
be up your alley.

24:54.621 --> 24:57.523
Colonel mustard
with the revolver

24:57.590 --> 24:59.424
In the billiard room.

24:59.492 --> 25:01.293
See, that's the third time

25:01.361 --> 25:02.961
That you've guessed
the billiard room.

25:03.029 --> 25:04.963
I've always wanted
a billiard room.

25:05.031 --> 25:07.332
I thought that you would
make a better detective.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.902
I detected that you
needed company.

25:14.407 --> 25:16.308
You've lived here a while,

25:16.376 --> 25:18.644
But you're still
living out of boxes.

25:18.711 --> 25:22.347
Maybe you moved around
a lot as a kid.

25:22.415 --> 25:24.917
A tumultuous childhood.

25:24.984 --> 25:30.923
A hard time
forming relationships.

25:30.990 --> 25:32.391
I may not be
the gumshoe you are,

25:32.458 --> 25:34.426
But I've got some skills.

25:34.494 --> 25:37.429
Well, you're right
about moving around a lot.

25:37.497 --> 25:38.964
I was a military brat.

25:39.032 --> 25:41.233
That would explain
the uniform.

25:41.301 --> 25:42.434
The uniform?

25:42.502 --> 25:43.635
<i>Yeah, bland clothes.</i>

25:43.703 --> 25:44.870
I don't think
I've ever seen you

25:44.938 --> 25:46.371
In a primary color.

25:46.439 --> 25:49.875
<i>It's because it's more
than a job to you.</i>

25:49.943 --> 25:52.377
You're a soldier.

25:52.445 --> 25:53.612
Protector.

25:53.680 --> 25:56.748
God, you'd be a blast
at dinner parties.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.383
I don't get invited to many.

25:58.451 --> 26:01.520
No.

26:01.588 --> 26:04.089
So what about you?

26:04.157 --> 26:07.092
What made you
the way you are?

26:07.160 --> 26:10.095
Oh, I don't know.

26:10.163 --> 26:13.098
I'm older than I look.

26:13.166 --> 26:15.734
I barely remember
my childhood.

26:15.802 --> 26:17.803
I'm also taller
than I appear.

26:22.308 --> 26:23.909
That's it.

26:23.977 --> 26:25.377
What?

26:25.445 --> 26:28.013
What did I say?

26:29.115 --> 26:32.017
[knock on door]

26:32.085 --> 26:34.119
Hey.
Hey.

26:34.187 --> 26:36.155
Uh, when we were
in Jacksonville,

26:36.223 --> 26:38.591
There was a height chart
on the wall with names.

26:38.658 --> 26:40.459
First name and last initial.

26:40.527 --> 26:42.261
All the kids that
I was in daycare with.

26:42.329 --> 26:43.596
Yeah, all the kids

26:43.663 --> 26:45.931
From Walter and Bell's
cortexiphan trials.

26:45.999 --> 26:47.066
So while I was there,

26:47.133 --> 26:48.667
I wrote down all their names

26:48.735 --> 26:51.537
And I made a list.

26:53.373 --> 26:55.608
"Timothy o."
Timothy Ober.

26:55.675 --> 26:56.742
He was there.

26:56.810 --> 26:59.178
We were both part
of walter's tests.

26:59.246 --> 27:00.713
So that's where
you remembered him from.

27:00.780 --> 27:03.916
Uh-huh. Keep looking.

27:03.984 --> 27:05.217
<i>Miranda g. And lloyd b.</i>

27:05.285 --> 27:06.919
<i>Julie h. Alan d.</i>

27:06.987 --> 27:08.554
They're all there.

27:08.622 --> 27:09.755
All five of his victims.

27:09.823 --> 27:10.756
So what does that mean?

27:10.824 --> 27:11.757
Why is this guy--

27:11.825 --> 27:13.559
Killing cortexiphan kids?
I don't know.

27:13.627 --> 27:16.295
I think we should
wake up Walter.

27:16.363 --> 27:17.863
That won't be necessary.

27:22.035 --> 27:25.437
Agent Dunham. Peter.

27:25.505 --> 27:27.339
Is it morning already?

27:27.407 --> 27:29.241
Oh, no. No, no.

27:29.309 --> 27:30.809
It's still
the middle of the night.

27:30.877 --> 27:32.544
Walter,
what is that smell?

27:32.612 --> 27:34.013
It's taffy.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.181
I'm making it for peter.

27:36.249 --> 27:37.683
I think she was
probably referring

27:37.751 --> 27:39.485
To your other project.

27:39.552 --> 27:43.289
<i>Is that
the killer's handprint?</i>

27:43.356 --> 27:45.090
I think we're close
to getting a fingerprint.

27:45.158 --> 27:46.191
The papillary ridges

27:46.259 --> 27:48.627
On the forefingers
are quite clear now.

27:48.695 --> 27:49.895
Once it's cooled a little,

27:49.963 --> 27:51.997
I should be able to run it
through the scanner.

27:52.065 --> 27:53.299
Well,
whoever the killer is,

27:53.366 --> 27:55.768
He's started to target
cortexiphan subjects.

27:58.972 --> 28:00.039
Are you sure?

28:00.106 --> 28:03.108
Yeah.

28:03.176 --> 28:06.178
Why?
Why would he do that?

28:06.246 --> 28:09.748
Well, we were hoping
you may have some idea.

28:10.750 --> 28:13.052
I don't know.

28:13.119 --> 28:16.889
But I have an idea why
they might be susceptible.

28:16.957 --> 28:18.257
To the cancer?

28:18.325 --> 28:20.826
The energy exchange
that this man is creating,

28:20.894 --> 28:23.395
I don't think
it would work on everyone.

28:23.463 --> 28:25.464
Cortexiphan was designed

28:25.532 --> 28:28.000
To--to allow children

28:28.068 --> 28:31.370
To access untapped parts
of their brain,

28:31.438 --> 28:33.005
Untapped energies.

28:33.073 --> 28:35.741
So you're saying that whatever
he's doing to his victims,

28:35.809 --> 28:37.443
Like,
exchanging his illness,

28:37.510 --> 28:39.979
It could only work
on cortexiphan children.

28:40.046 --> 28:41.547
Yes.

28:41.614 --> 28:42.815
I think so.

28:42.882 --> 28:45.417
<i>So then I guess
the question really is:</i>

28:45.485 --> 28:46.952
How does he know about
the cortexiphan trials?

28:47.020 --> 28:48.921
And then how is he
tracking those people down?

28:48.989 --> 28:50.356
Now, you've said
that you and bell

28:50.423 --> 28:51.690
Never kept a list
of the children

28:51.758 --> 28:52.958
That you experimented on.

28:53.026 --> 28:54.426
I didn't.

28:54.494 --> 28:57.062
And if belly did,
I never saw it.

28:57.130 --> 28:58.397
Okay,
but what about Nina Sharp?

28:58.465 --> 29:00.833
I mean, she started working
with Bell around the same time.

29:00.900 --> 29:03.702
<i>Mm-mm. We asked.
Last year.</i>

29:03.770 --> 29:05.304
When harris was tracking down
nick lane and nancy lewis,

29:05.372 --> 29:06.739
We asked her.
She doesn't have a list.

29:06.806 --> 29:08.140
Yeah, but I believe
that Nina Sharp

29:08.208 --> 29:11.677
Isn't always so forthcoming.

29:11.745 --> 29:15.481
<i>(nina)
why would someone be hunting
cortexiphan test subjects?</i>

29:15.548 --> 29:16.782
Uh, I don't know.

29:16.850 --> 29:19.485
Walter thinks that they could be
particularly susceptible.

29:19.552 --> 29:22.354
Ah.
That's troubling.

29:22.422 --> 29:24.823
Did william bell
ever show you a list?

29:24.891 --> 29:26.425
Of cortexiphan subjects?

29:26.493 --> 29:28.660
<i>Mm-hmm.
No.</i>

29:28.728 --> 29:31.330
And there's nothing in
the massive dynamic chives?

29:31.398 --> 29:32.865
As I've told you before,

29:32.932 --> 29:34.199
There's nothing on record.

29:34.267 --> 29:36.602
Do you doubt me,
agent dunham?

29:36.669 --> 29:38.871
I don't know.

29:38.938 --> 29:42.241
I've always been a little
foggy as to your motives.

29:42.308 --> 29:45.377
What are you implying?

29:45.445 --> 29:47.179
Well, you've kept
information from me

29:47.247 --> 29:48.380
Since I met you--

29:48.448 --> 29:50.182
Information
that has prevented me

29:50.250 --> 29:52.117
From understanding
the origin of many,

29:52.185 --> 29:54.253
If not all of the cases
I've investigated

29:54.320 --> 29:56.355
While working with
Fringe division.

29:56.423 --> 30:01.627
And I know about peter.

30:01.694 --> 30:04.596
I know the whole story.

30:04.664 --> 30:07.132
Does peter know?

30:07.200 --> 30:08.367
<i>Have you told him?</i>

30:08.435 --> 30:10.436
No.

30:10.503 --> 30:13.672
But I'm going to.

30:15.675 --> 30:17.242
No. You won't.

30:17.310 --> 30:19.144
What makes you
so sure about that?

30:19.212 --> 30:21.046
Because you
haven't told him yet.

30:21.114 --> 30:23.649
And I'm guessing you've had
any number of opportunities.

30:23.716 --> 30:26.919
Well, I've had my reasons
for waiting.

30:26.986 --> 30:28.587
This is the right
thing to do,

30:28.655 --> 30:29.955
And peter needs
to know the truth.

30:30.023 --> 30:32.858
Whether or not
it's the right thing to do,

30:32.926 --> 30:36.195
I recognize
the look in your eyes.

30:36.262 --> 30:39.164
I know that working together
closely with someone

30:39.232 --> 30:40.699
Can bring about feelings.

30:40.767 --> 30:43.001
<i>I'm fairly certain</i>

30:43.069 --> 30:46.138
<i>That you're not
prepared to lose him.</i>

30:46.206 --> 30:47.539
<i>You didn't come here today</i>

30:47.607 --> 30:48.807
To ask me about a list

30:48.875 --> 30:50.809
That you already knew
I don't have.

30:50.877 --> 30:53.412
And you didn't come here
to announce

30:53.480 --> 30:56.381
That you're going to tell
peter who he really is.

30:58.885 --> 31:01.987
You came here...

31:02.055 --> 31:04.690
To have me
talk you out of it.

31:16.457 --> 31:18.492
[knock on door]

31:26.100 --> 31:27.300
Mrs. Lane?

31:27.368 --> 31:28.735
Yes.

31:28.803 --> 31:29.936
I'm sorry to disturb you.

31:30.004 --> 31:31.071
I--I tried calling.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.640
My name is john mchugh.

31:33.708 --> 31:35.976
I went to school
with your son, nick.

31:36.043 --> 31:38.345
Uh, no, nick is my nephew.

31:38.412 --> 31:41.848
Oh. Uh...

31:41.916 --> 31:43.850
Ah.

31:43.918 --> 31:45.418
You--you look awful.

31:45.486 --> 31:47.254
Why don't you come inside?

31:47.321 --> 31:49.256
Thank you.

31:58.132 --> 31:59.966
The red wire
goes in the red hole.

32:00.034 --> 32:00.967
The blue in--

32:01.035 --> 32:02.169
Yes, thank you, Walter.

32:02.236 --> 32:06.139
I was able to figure that out
all by myself.

32:06.207 --> 32:07.841
Hey.
How'd it go?

32:07.909 --> 32:10.710
Uh, nina
didn't have anything.

32:10.778 --> 32:13.313
How's it going here?

32:13.381 --> 32:15.482
Well, we'll soon see.

32:15.550 --> 32:16.583
<i>Don't be so skeptical,
peter.</i>

32:16.651 --> 32:19.052
You liked the taffy,
didn't you?

32:19.120 --> 32:21.721
Absolutely.

32:21.789 --> 32:24.457
I have my doubts.

32:24.525 --> 32:25.859
Ready?

32:25.927 --> 32:27.928
[machine whirs]

32:31.098 --> 32:32.332
What's it doing?

32:32.400 --> 32:35.135
Familiarizing itself with
the genetic composition.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.604
Dismissing
any foreign elements.

32:37.672 --> 32:42.242
It's amazing how much filth
we carry around on our hands.

32:42.310 --> 32:43.643
Go ahead, dear.

32:43.711 --> 32:46.213
[typing]

32:46.280 --> 32:47.414
It worked.

32:47.481 --> 32:50.884
Of course it did.

32:50.952 --> 32:52.319
Okay, astrid,
we need to run this

32:52.386 --> 32:54.387
Through the joint
law enforcement database.

32:54.455 --> 32:55.956
See if we can get
a name for this guy.

32:58.492 --> 33:00.994
Well done, walter.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.696
Thank you, son.

33:07.168 --> 33:08.101
<i>Nothing.</i>

33:08.169 --> 33:09.603
He's not in our system.

33:09.670 --> 33:11.571
No priors,
no arrest record.

33:11.639 --> 33:13.273
So...

33:13.341 --> 33:15.508
We're nowhere.

33:19.046 --> 33:20.847
You said you went
to school with nick.

33:20.915 --> 33:22.215
A long time ago,

33:22.283 --> 33:24.918
Back in jacksonville.

33:24.986 --> 33:28.321
We have a mutual friend,
lloyd becker.

33:28.389 --> 33:30.390
<i>He said I could find
nick here.</i>

33:30.458 --> 33:32.726
I remember lloyd.

33:32.793 --> 33:34.895
Oh, such a sweet boy.

33:37.465 --> 33:39.633
<i>Nick lived here a while</i>

33:39.700 --> 33:41.268
<i>After his parents died.</i>

33:41.335 --> 33:42.269
He moved to brooklyn...

33:42.336 --> 33:44.170
Several years ago.

33:44.238 --> 33:47.574
Do you--do you know how I could
get in contact with him?

33:47.642 --> 33:49.542
Do you have
his phone number?

33:49.610 --> 33:50.644
I'm afraid not.

33:50.711 --> 33:54.681
I haven't heard from him
for some time.

33:54.749 --> 33:56.917
It's funny, though.

33:56.984 --> 33:59.019
Someone else

33:59.086 --> 34:01.021
From jacksonville
came by,

34:01.088 --> 34:03.189
Oh, six months ago
asking for nick.

34:03.257 --> 34:05.759
She must have gone
to school with you as well.

34:05.826 --> 34:11.431
You don't by any chance
remember her name, do you?

34:30.083 --> 34:32.552
God, what am I missing?

34:54.909 --> 34:57.243
[telephone rings]

34:58.245 --> 34:59.312
Dunham?

34:59.380 --> 35:01.548
I think I may have found
our killer.

35:01.615 --> 35:03.750
His name is james heath,

35:03.818 --> 35:06.052
And he was
a cortexiphan subject too.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.721
<i>I think that may be
how he's doing this.</i>

35:07.788 --> 35:08.822
James heath?

35:08.889 --> 35:10.256
Wasn't heath the last name
of the first--

35:10.324 --> 35:11.424
<i>Yep, of the first victim--</i>

35:11.492 --> 35:12.525
Julie heath.

35:12.593 --> 35:14.094
Uh, she was his sister.

35:14.161 --> 35:16.129
<i>James was in the hospital.</i>

35:16.197 --> 35:17.497
She was visiting him,

35:17.565 --> 35:19.699
And she just suddenly
collapsed and died.

35:19.767 --> 35:21.468
He was, uh, he was having
chemo treatment.

35:21.535 --> 35:23.036
He had cancer.

35:23.104 --> 35:24.237
Do you have the name
of the hospital

35:24.305 --> 35:25.238
Where heath was treated?

35:25.306 --> 35:26.339
Uh, yeah.

35:26.407 --> 35:28.775
It's abington
memorial hospital.

35:28.843 --> 35:30.944
<i>It's just outside
philadelphia.</i>

35:31.012 --> 35:33.747
Okay. I'll see if they have
a current address for him.

35:33.814 --> 35:35.949
Thanks.

35:40.855 --> 35:42.989
<i>You're olivia dunham.</i>

35:43.057 --> 35:47.160
You probably
don't remember me.

35:47.228 --> 35:50.964
<i>My name is Nate Reed.</i>

35:51.032 --> 35:54.768
Nick Lane
gave me your address?

36:04.519 --> 36:06.120
You and I
went to school together

36:06.188 --> 36:08.155
When we were kids.

36:08.223 --> 36:10.157
Back in Jacksonville.

36:10.225 --> 36:14.461
I see.

36:14.529 --> 36:16.230
What can I do for you?

36:16.298 --> 36:21.068
I was hoping you'd have
a few minutes to talk.

36:21.136 --> 36:24.905
Sure.

36:24.973 --> 36:28.409
Why don't you come in?

36:40.188 --> 36:42.389
[grunts]

36:42.457 --> 36:44.758
[groans]

36:44.826 --> 36:47.127
[coughs]

37:03.078 --> 37:04.845
[phone beeps]

37:04.913 --> 37:06.714
[phone rings]

37:06.781 --> 37:08.349
Hello?

37:08.416 --> 37:09.650
Peter.

37:09.718 --> 37:10.851
Peter, peter, it's me.

37:10.919 --> 37:11.852
He's in my house!

37:11.920 --> 37:14.588
[grunting]

37:25.000 --> 37:28.135
You stay down.

37:40.415 --> 37:43.384
I didn't want this.

37:43.451 --> 37:46.387
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

37:46.454 --> 37:51.859
Then why did you?

37:51.926 --> 37:55.396
A man came to see me

37:55.463 --> 37:58.365
When I was in the hospital.

37:58.433 --> 38:01.235
He said when I was a kid

38:01.303 --> 38:04.204
Scientists had
experimented on me,

38:04.272 --> 38:06.373
That because
of the experiments,

38:06.441 --> 38:09.476
He could teach me
how to fight the cancer.

38:09.544 --> 38:12.146
But it didn't work.

38:12.213 --> 38:14.148
I didn't get better.
I got worse.

38:14.215 --> 38:18.419
So what happened
to your sister?

38:18.486 --> 38:21.322
<i>She stayed with me
while I was in the hospital.</i>

38:21.389 --> 38:24.992
She never left my side.

38:26.895 --> 38:28.228
And when the pain got bad,

38:28.296 --> 38:29.830
She'd hold my hand.

38:29.898 --> 38:31.498
<i>For hours.</i>

38:31.566 --> 38:34.435
<i>And then, one day,</i>

38:34.502 --> 38:38.639
It just happened.

38:38.707 --> 38:40.607
I called the nurses for help,

38:40.675 --> 38:43.811
But it was too late.

38:46.681 --> 38:49.249
I watched her die.

38:49.317 --> 38:53.587
But you got better.

38:57.492 --> 39:00.027
I had to find that man.

39:00.095 --> 39:02.930
<i>I thought someone from
jacksonville</i>

39:02.997 --> 39:04.565
Might know him.

39:04.632 --> 39:07.468
And then I found timothy.

39:07.535 --> 39:09.570
And you killed him too.

39:09.637 --> 39:10.571
Not on purpose.

39:10.638 --> 39:15.008
It just happened.

39:15.076 --> 39:20.013
But that's when
I realized how it worked.

39:22.817 --> 39:27.755
I think...
If that man had never...

39:27.822 --> 39:29.857
Come to see me,

39:29.924 --> 39:34.595
I would have died
the way I was supposed to,

39:34.662 --> 39:38.031
And my sister
would still be alive.

39:41.503 --> 39:44.838
They'd all still be alive.

39:46.474 --> 39:48.308
<i>(man)
in here.</i>

39:48.376 --> 39:51.578
It's okay.

39:51.646 --> 39:55.649
[sobbing]

40:13.902 --> 40:16.603
How come you
didn't call broyles?

40:16.671 --> 40:21.008
I've got you
on speed dial.

40:21.075 --> 40:22.342
Really?

40:22.410 --> 40:25.312
I'm number one on
olivia dunham's speed dial?

40:25.380 --> 40:27.881
Well, no, but I didn't think

40:27.949 --> 40:30.150
That rachel or mr. Iyer
from the indian takeout

40:30.218 --> 40:31.785
Would be much use.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.428
Peter...

40:48.770 --> 40:50.604
Thank you for coming.

40:50.672 --> 40:54.274
You're welcome.

40:59.981 --> 41:01.648
He's in a drug-induced coma,

41:01.716 --> 41:04.518
Which seems to have stopped
the progression of his cancer.

41:04.586 --> 41:06.887
Anthe man who tried
to activate him,

41:06.955 --> 41:08.789
Do we know who he was?

41:08.857 --> 41:11.859
He sounds like the same man
who sanford harris hired

41:11.926 --> 41:13.627
To activate nancy lewis
and nick lane.

41:13.695 --> 41:15.596
I assume
the activation failed,

41:15.663 --> 41:17.998
And mr. Heath's...Ability

41:18.066 --> 41:20.400
Was just an unfortunate
side effect.

41:20.468 --> 41:21.635
Hmm.

41:21.703 --> 41:23.303
So I don't imagine

41:23.371 --> 41:24.638
You called me
all the way down here

41:24.706 --> 41:26.373
Just to share
in your victory.

41:26.441 --> 41:30.210
Aside from olivia dunham,

41:30.278 --> 41:33.981
There are still nearly a dozen
unaccounted for people

41:34.048 --> 41:35.449
From the jacksonville
experiments,

41:35.517 --> 41:37.551
And 30 more from
the drug trials in wooster.

41:37.619 --> 41:39.520
If they all
have capabilities

41:39.587 --> 41:40.921
Anything like
the ones we've seen,

41:40.989 --> 41:42.322
And if someone
were to find them...

41:42.390 --> 41:47.127
Well, philip, then we need
to find them first.

41:51.533 --> 41:53.500
Agent dunham.
Hello.

41:53.568 --> 41:55.168
Hi.

41:55.236 --> 41:57.304
Uh, is peter here?

41:57.372 --> 42:00.207
Uh, no.
No, he went out.

42:00.275 --> 42:01.909
Okay, good, because
I would like to talk to you.

42:01.976 --> 42:02.943
Agent dunham--

42:03.011 --> 42:04.278
Walter, please.
Please, walter.

42:04.345 --> 42:06.847
Just...Let me finish.

42:12.887 --> 42:17.658
I think
that you may be right.

42:17.725 --> 42:22.563
I think that maybe some truths
can do more harm than good

42:22.630 --> 42:26.300
And that some pandora's boxes

42:26.367 --> 42:30.470
Are better left unopened.

42:30.538 --> 42:32.873
So...

42:35.176 --> 42:37.311
I'm not gonna tell peter.

42:44.052 --> 42:48.455
Thank you, olivia.

42:48.523 --> 42:52.759
The truth is
I've done enough damage,

42:52.827 --> 42:58.398
And it's time to start
to put things right...

42:58.466 --> 43:02.202
Whatever the consequences.

43:02.270 --> 43:07.741
And that starts with
telling Peter the truth.

43:07.809 --> 43:10.711
I have to tell him
who he really is.
