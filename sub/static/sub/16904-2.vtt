00:04.417 --> 00:05.483
Hey, yo!

00:05.551 --> 00:06.484
Back that...

00:08.420 --> 00:09.920
And you can...

00:09.988 --> 00:13.857
While I...
Off your...

00:13.925 --> 00:15.325
Disgusting, sir!

00:15.393 --> 00:17.026
Would you talk like that
to your mother

00:17.094 --> 00:18.494
or your daughter

00:18.562 --> 00:20.363
or your surgeon?

00:20.430 --> 00:22.456
Just because my friend
is blonde

00:22.524 --> 00:24.681
and never closes
her mouth fully...

00:24.772 --> 00:26.027
hey, I wasn't talking to her.

00:26.095 --> 00:27.648
I was talking to you, glasses.

00:27.716 --> 00:29.720
I bet you have...

00:33.319 --> 00:34.832
...Infected penis.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.960
That has never happened
to me before.

00:39.028 --> 00:40.339
Well, I'm not surprised.

00:40.407 --> 00:42.761
Not because you're not cute.
You are...

00:42.829 --> 00:44.612
like a pretty refugee
on the news.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.706
It's because you've always
put out this negative energy.

00:47.774 --> 00:49.456
But now that
you're with someone,

00:49.524 --> 00:50.998
you're happy and confident.

00:51.073 --> 00:52.814
Guys can sense that.

00:52.881 --> 00:54.022
Confident, huh?

00:54.096 --> 00:55.770
So can I finally wear
that cowboy hat

00:55.838 --> 00:58.125
I bought at Kiss-FM's
lake jam '97?

00:58.192 --> 01:00.171
Um...The point is,

01:00.239 --> 01:02.852
being with someone makes
people want to be with you.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.063
You know,
when it rains, it pours.

01:06.443 --> 01:09.260
I want your feet in my mouth.

01:09.328 --> 01:12.810
When it rains, it pours.

01:15.866 --> 01:25.936

01:32.844 --> 01:34.456
Hello, "Javery."

01:34.723 --> 01:36.497
Time-saver.

01:36.565 --> 01:37.902
Lemon, we have news.

01:37.969 --> 01:39.643
Like God, I created man.

01:39.710 --> 01:40.913
We're having a boy.

01:40.981 --> 01:43.055
That's great.
Congratulations.

01:43.122 --> 01:45.296
Think about it, Liz.

01:45.364 --> 01:47.740
Every woman my boy dates
will get compared to me,

01:47.808 --> 01:50.148
and they will be found wanting.

01:50.215 --> 01:51.854
He's very lucky
to have you as his mother.

01:51.922 --> 01:54.532
I'll tell you why he's lucky.
He's got an old dad.

01:54.599 --> 01:56.169
I'm sorry?

01:56.237 --> 01:57.775
I had an old dad.
It was awesome.

01:57.843 --> 02:00.049
I could get away with anything.

02:01.824 --> 02:04.497
This is just what I need...

02:04.567 --> 02:07.406
To store my rock collection.

02:07.474 --> 02:09.312
Lemon, I'm not an old dad.

02:09.381 --> 02:11.722
50 is the new 40...
For men.

02:11.790 --> 02:14.295
But 50 is still 60 for women.

02:14.363 --> 02:16.001
Whatevs, Tony Randall.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.271
Whatevs, indeed,

02:17.339 --> 02:19.344
because that makes you
Jack Klugman.

02:19.412 --> 02:21.585
Damn! I'm a writer.

02:21.653 --> 02:24.526
I'm messy.
I'm a loveable curmudgeon.

02:24.595 --> 02:26.700
That is solid!

02:26.768 --> 02:28.303
Advantage, Donaghy.

02:28.371 --> 02:29.842
Hmm.

02:29.910 --> 02:31.312
Rundowns are already out.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.384
I can't believe how smoothly
everything's going

02:33.452 --> 02:34.923
without Kenneth here.
I know.

02:34.990 --> 02:36.895
Do you remember
my tattoo mishap?

02:36.962 --> 02:38.431
It was supposed to say "peace,"

02:38.499 --> 02:39.936
but they wrote
"white hooker" instead.

02:40.004 --> 02:41.975
I forgot I was getting
it removed today,

02:42.042 --> 02:45.084
but someone slipped a note
under my door to remind me.

02:45.151 --> 02:46.923
Well, no one
could ever replace Kenneth,

02:46.990 --> 02:49.028
but these new kids
are getting it done.

02:49.096 --> 02:50.198
- Mm-hmm.

02:54.679 --> 02:58.286
Liz, Tracy will not be coming
out of his dressing room today.

02:58.354 --> 02:59.688
Oh, come on!
What now?

02:59.756 --> 03:02.326
- I'm "werewolfing" myself.
- Sure.

03:02.394 --> 03:04.565
You know when a dude knows
he's gonna turn into a werewolf

03:04.632 --> 03:07.372
and locks himself into a jail?

03:07.440 --> 03:08.876
Well, I'm embarrassed to say

03:08.944 --> 03:11.148
I've missed the birth
of both of my sons

03:11.216 --> 03:12.852
for very legitimate reasons.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.624
- Cooking a French-bread pizza
and forgot.

03:15.693 --> 03:19.266
So I promised Angie I will not
miss the birth of our daughter.

03:19.334 --> 03:21.940
She was due yesterday,
so we're not taking any chances.

03:22.007 --> 03:23.409
Grizz is guarding
the other door...

03:23.477 --> 03:24.478
And reading.

03:24.546 --> 03:26.116
Also, we took Tracy's
cell phone,

03:26.184 --> 03:28.055
- his wallet...
- And my mood ring!

03:28.122 --> 03:30.259
And I don't know
how I feel about that.

03:30.327 --> 03:32.431
Well, I'm glad you're gonna be
there for Angie.

03:32.499 --> 03:33.802
Good for you.

03:33.869 --> 03:35.405
And good for you, Liz Lemon.

03:35.472 --> 03:36.842
There's something
about you lately,

03:36.910 --> 03:38.846
make me want to put
my feet in your mouth.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.062
- It's your turn.
- What?

03:46.130 --> 03:47.965
Editing hasn't sent up
the title sequence yet,

03:48.033 --> 03:50.168
and it's your turn
to go down there.

03:50.236 --> 03:52.038
God, I hate how much power
they have over us.

03:52.106 --> 03:54.009
Who do they think they are...
mommy and her sisters?

03:54.077 --> 03:55.545
Jeez, calm down.

03:55.613 --> 03:57.850
They know we need them,
so they torture us.

03:57.918 --> 03:59.186
How's it going?

03:59.254 --> 04:01.759
I'm done, actually.

04:03.697 --> 04:04.899
Okay, you know what?

04:04.967 --> 04:06.535
I will take care of editing
from now on.

04:06.603 --> 04:08.172
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.709
I'll go down there,
turn on the new Liz Lemon charm,

04:10.778 --> 04:13.315
a little Julia Roberts laugh...
Ha ha ha!

04:13.382 --> 04:15.650
- What's in your teeth?
- Corn.

04:19.821 --> 04:21.689
70, Lemon.

04:21.755 --> 04:25.158
I will be 70 years old when
my son graduates prep school.

04:25.226 --> 04:27.827
- Oh, come on.
Is this about my old-dad thing?

04:27.894 --> 04:29.695
I was joking.

04:29.763 --> 04:32.097
Will I even be there
for his first subpoena?

04:32.165 --> 04:36.134
Will I ever experience
the father-son bonding

04:36.202 --> 04:37.535
of realizing you were both

04:37.603 --> 04:40.437
at the same masked orgy
in a castle?

04:40.505 --> 04:42.706
I will be senile...
Or dead

04:42.774 --> 04:44.408
for the better part
of my child's life.

04:44.475 --> 04:46.076
Am I pulling this off?

04:46.143 --> 04:48.544
I cannot escape death, Lemon,
but I will cheat it.

04:48.612 --> 04:50.680
Whatever happens to me,
I must find a way

04:50.747 --> 04:53.148
to speak to...
And guide my son,

04:53.216 --> 04:54.783
even from the grave.

04:54.850 --> 04:55.784
Woo...

04:56.919 --> 04:58.219
This is a test
of the fire system.

04:58.287 --> 05:00.020
Please evacuate the building.
You coming downstairs?

05:00.088 --> 05:03.590
And stand outside
in a crowd like some Italian?

05:03.658 --> 05:05.859
I don't think so.

05:05.926 --> 05:07.494
You know,
as floor fire marshal,

05:07.561 --> 05:08.828
Kenneth always ran
the fire drills.

05:08.896 --> 05:12.964
Who's doing it now?
One of the new kids, I guess.

05:14.332 --> 05:15.799
This is a fire drill.

05:15.867 --> 05:18.635
All NBC employees
exit to the Plaza.

05:18.703 --> 05:22.205
I can't leave my dressing room
until Angie goes into labor.

05:22.273 --> 05:24.740
But the president is saying
we have to go outside.

05:24.808 --> 05:26.308
It's okay, Tray.

05:26.376 --> 05:28.443
We'll all go down together.
Then we'll bring you back up.

05:28.511 --> 05:30.813
Just stay with your grown-up.

05:35.451 --> 05:37.385
If I were a real werewolf,

05:37.453 --> 05:38.786
I'd wear baggy clothes

05:38.854 --> 05:40.788
so my nice clothes
wouldn't get all torn up.

05:40.856 --> 05:43.424
Same rule
for if I were the hulk.

05:43.491 --> 05:46.392
I don't get why people
like brunch.

05:46.460 --> 05:49.595
What's the benefit of combining
break dancing and lunch?

05:49.663 --> 05:52.829
Tray?

05:52.897 --> 05:53.829
You're not Grizz!

05:53.897 --> 05:56.699
Ah!

06:01.404 --> 06:03.338
- Hello?
- I'm at the damn hospital!

06:03.406 --> 06:04.806
Where is Tracy?

06:10.845 --> 06:11.945
What?

06:15.350 --> 06:17.584
Good morning.
Now, full disclosure...

06:17.652 --> 06:20.421
most of my experience
is putting babies in women.

06:20.488 --> 06:22.156
Oh.
I'ma kill that man.

06:22.224 --> 06:23.791
You just described my morning.

06:23.858 --> 06:25.626
Now, Mrs. Jordan,

06:25.693 --> 06:27.161
I've already administered
the epidural.

06:27.228 --> 06:29.463
So would you like one as well?

06:29.531 --> 06:31.696
- I am trying to help you.

06:34.006 --> 06:36.808
My son...
You may not remember me.

06:37.375 --> 06:40.177
I am your father.

06:40.245 --> 06:43.247
This message is coming to you
either from beyond the grave

06:43.314 --> 06:46.182
or because I am
in the grip of insanity.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.584
The purpose of these DVDs
is to educate

06:48.652 --> 06:51.319
and guide you through life
in my absence.

06:51.387 --> 06:54.322
I will begin
with our shared history.

06:54.389 --> 06:55.656
The Donaghys originally come

06:55.723 --> 06:57.824
from Ireland's
little known county Steve,

06:57.892 --> 07:01.493
where, historically, we were
whiskey testers and goblins.

07:01.561 --> 07:04.296
I was raised
in Sadchester, Massachusetts,

07:04.364 --> 07:06.631
I won the amory blaine
handsomeness scholarship

07:06.699 --> 07:07.932
to Princeton

07:08.000 --> 07:09.667
and then attended
Harvard business school

07:09.735 --> 07:11.402
where I was voted "most."

07:11.470 --> 07:15.772
I once hit a stand-up triple
off Fidel Castro.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.407
I was the first person
ever to say,

07:17.475 --> 07:19.244
"I need a vacation
from this vacation."

07:19.311 --> 07:23.514
<i>The song you're so vain
was, in fact, written by me.</i>

07:23.582 --> 07:25.049
In other words, I have lived.

07:25.116 --> 07:27.050
In living, I have learned.

07:27.118 --> 07:30.687
And now I want to impart
that knowledge to you.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.789
I will begin with the basics.

07:32.857 --> 07:35.024
You are hiking
in the Japanese highlands.

07:35.092 --> 07:36.925
A pair of snow leopards
is stalking you,

07:36.993 --> 07:40.428
and the blade of your katana
is frosted into its scabbard.

07:40.495 --> 07:41.762
What?

07:41.829 --> 07:43.863
What's up, edit seven gang?

07:43.931 --> 07:46.265
Ritchie, Donna,

07:46.332 --> 07:47.632
Ray...

07:47.700 --> 07:49.767
Split the difference,
but keep the music where it is.

07:49.834 --> 07:51.935
<i>- What are you guys working on?
- Piece for the today show</i>

07:52.003 --> 07:54.438
about how next month
is October.

07:54.505 --> 07:56.139
Islanders, huh?
So you think they're gonna

07:56.206 --> 07:58.009
end up trading...
Francen fren?

07:58.076 --> 07:59.979
Who, Matt Moulson?
They should.

08:00.046 --> 08:01.548
I'm better than that clown.

08:01.616 --> 08:03.984
- So you play?
- Do I play?

08:04.051 --> 08:06.319
I go to islanders fantasy camp
every year.

08:06.387 --> 08:08.655
- You must be a strong skater.
- Well, I can't go backwards.

08:08.723 --> 08:10.491
But, yeah, I'm good.

08:11.893 --> 08:14.562
- Were you in the army?
- Oh. No.

08:14.629 --> 08:16.897
Better...
civil war reenactor.

08:16.965 --> 08:19.066
Kind of an expert
at getting shot

08:19.134 --> 08:22.369
by, uh, smooth-bore firearms,
you know?

08:22.436 --> 08:23.569
Like... kah, kah!

08:23.637 --> 08:25.271
Kah, kah, kah, kow!

08:25.339 --> 08:27.106
Blah, hah!

08:27.174 --> 08:28.608
Gah! Kaw! Kah!

08:28.675 --> 08:31.978
Kaw, kaw!
Ah, death to Lincoln!

08:32.044 --> 08:33.946
- Oh, so a southern gentleman.
- Oh, yeah.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.181
Well, thank you.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.282
Thank you very much.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.518
Ritchie!

08:39.586 --> 08:41.553
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.288
Cool hat, by the way.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.624
Hey, uh, you know what?

08:45.691 --> 08:47.592
Let's switch to the other deck.

08:47.659 --> 08:49.293
<i>I forgot I got to get
those TGS titles done</i>

08:49.361 --> 08:52.463
for Liz here.

08:52.531 --> 08:53.798
I just got to get
to the hospital

08:53.866 --> 08:55.199
and wait there!

08:55.267 --> 08:57.301
Taxi!
Sir...

08:57.369 --> 08:58.769
I don't have any money,

08:58.837 --> 09:00.703
but I need to get
to Mount Sinai Hospital.

09:00.771 --> 09:02.304
No problem.
Hop in.

09:02.371 --> 09:04.705
Wow. It's like
I always say...

09:04.773 --> 09:07.538
"white cab drivers
are weird."

09:11.941 --> 09:13.273
You're in the cash cab.
It's a TV game show

09:13.341 --> 09:15.374
that takes place
right here in my taxi.

09:15.442 --> 09:16.807
Explain the rules.

09:16.875 --> 09:19.006
You answer trivia questions
for money and a free ride.

09:19.074 --> 09:20.606
But if you answer incorrectly,

09:20.674 --> 09:22.341
the game is over,
and you're out of the cab.

09:22.408 --> 09:24.142
So for me to be there
at the birth of my daughter,

09:24.210 --> 09:25.977
I have to answer
trivia questions,

09:26.044 --> 09:28.145
despite having gone
to middle school

09:28.212 --> 09:29.345
in an exxon station?

09:29.413 --> 09:30.846
Yeah.
You ready to play?

09:30.914 --> 09:32.348
Bring it!

09:32.415 --> 09:34.783
Your main titles, milady.

09:34.851 --> 09:36.518
- Aha.
- And this...

09:36.586 --> 09:39.653
Is a cd of some civil war songs
I thought you'd like.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.287
It's very authentic.

09:41.355 --> 09:43.156
So don't play it around
your black friends.

09:43.223 --> 09:44.991
Well, thanks, Ritchie.

09:45.059 --> 09:47.661
- Mm-hmm.
Okay.

09:47.729 --> 09:50.530
Oh!
Wow, this is a nice hug.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.667
Two becoming one, hmm?

09:56.770 --> 09:58.304
Bam!
Blah!

10:00.606 --> 10:03.508
What the hell, Liz?
I thought Ritchie was lying.

10:03.576 --> 10:05.310
You know, if you wanted
to cheat on Carol

10:05.378 --> 10:08.213
with an Italian dude
who smells like cigarettes,

10:08.281 --> 10:10.949
I've made it very clear I would
flip over my futon for you.

10:11.017 --> 10:12.917
Not cool!

10:12.985 --> 10:14.819
What is he talking about?

10:14.887 --> 10:16.488
Okay.
It's not a big deal.

10:16.556 --> 10:18.423
Ritchie has just been
telling the crew

10:18.491 --> 10:20.692
that you two
are sleeping together.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.127
- What?
- Your new vibe

10:22.194 --> 10:23.428
is a double-edged sword...

10:23.496 --> 10:25.430
much like the kind Mickey Rourke
tried to kill me with.

10:25.497 --> 10:26.831
Great.
So that's what I get

10:26.899 --> 10:29.233
for being happy,
for being nice,

10:29.301 --> 10:30.668
and rocking a cowboy hat

10:30.736 --> 10:34.105
that a Kiss-FM DJ
once called a "sweet lid"?

10:34.172 --> 10:36.140
But you can't say
anything to him.

10:36.207 --> 10:37.508
Are you kidding me?

10:37.575 --> 10:39.910
<i>If you do, he'll take it out
on TGS, on us!</i>

10:39.977 --> 10:41.610
I'll be here waiting for edits
till 4:00 in the morning

10:41.678 --> 10:43.578
when I should be at home...

10:43.646 --> 10:46.614
Which is the name of a bar
I found near the train station.

10:46.682 --> 10:49.383
I'm sorry. You want me
to just take this for the team?

10:49.451 --> 10:51.519
Please. You know he can make
our lives a living hell.

10:51.586 --> 10:53.453
We all make sacrifices, Liz.

10:53.521 --> 10:56.589
I had to be at work
this morning at 11:00.

10:56.657 --> 10:57.990
Fine.
Fine.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.794
Oh...
You got sauce on me!

11:03.861 --> 11:05.561
You know, neighbors
who wear my exact size

11:05.629 --> 11:08.096
don't die every day!

11:09.532 --> 11:11.366
A gift from France
to the United States,

11:11.434 --> 11:14.602
the statute of liberty
was completed in what year?

11:14.670 --> 11:16.037
Come on, I don't know that.

11:16.104 --> 11:17.638
You've got 15 seconds,
or you're out of the cab.

11:17.705 --> 11:19.606
Okay.
I remember going to

11:19.674 --> 11:21.374
the Statue of Liberty Centennial,

11:21.442 --> 11:23.409
'cause that year
someone had spread a rumor

11:23.477 --> 11:25.711
that she was gonna slip
out of her toga,

11:25.779 --> 11:27.446
and I wanted to see
some green boobies.

11:27.513 --> 11:29.380
And the mets had just won
the world series,

11:29.448 --> 11:30.781
'cause that night,

11:30.849 --> 11:32.350
I was randomly attacked
by a Mets fan

11:32.417 --> 11:34.118
that I had threw a bottle at.

11:34.186 --> 11:36.253
That was 1986.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.588
And centennial is 100 years,

11:38.656 --> 11:42.391
because "centipeding" means
having sex with 100 women.

11:42.459 --> 11:45.127
I got it!
1886!

11:45.195 --> 11:46.762
Yes!
That is correct.

11:46.829 --> 11:48.430
Weighing up to 4 tons,

11:48.498 --> 11:50.332
what type of mammal
is the famous shamu?

11:50.399 --> 11:53.400
She is an orca, Benjamin.

11:53.468 --> 11:57.136
Fyi, they're very difficult
to keep in a home aquarium.

11:57.204 --> 11:59.505
- Right again!
- I'm coming, Angie!

11:59.572 --> 12:02.173
Son, I may not be there
for your wedding.

12:02.241 --> 12:03.908
It breaks my heart
to realize that.

12:03.975 --> 12:06.676
But I want to offer you
one piece of fatherly advice.

12:06.744 --> 12:09.445
Do not hire sting
to play the reception.

12:09.512 --> 12:12.814
He'll insist on doing
jazz versions of police songs,

12:12.881 --> 12:14.315
and it's just...

12:14.383 --> 12:15.416
Demoralizing.

12:15.483 --> 12:16.783
After I'm gone,

12:16.851 --> 12:18.484
your mother
may meet someone else.

12:18.552 --> 12:20.720
I want her to be happy, so...

12:20.787 --> 12:22.421
His death must appear
to be accidental.

12:22.489 --> 12:25.190
The secret to a strong,
healthy head of hair

12:25.258 --> 12:26.991
is dove...Blood.

12:27.059 --> 12:31.194
Remember, the backflip
is 90% confidence.

12:37.699 --> 12:39.333
Kenneth,
what are you doing here?

12:39.401 --> 12:40.434
I'm sorry, sir.

12:40.501 --> 12:41.768
I was just sweeping
your terrace,

12:41.836 --> 12:43.870
and then you came in,
and I was trapped.

12:43.938 --> 12:45.705
Just like the time
I was cleaning my closet,

12:45.772 --> 12:47.506
and my mom
and her friend Ron came in

12:47.574 --> 12:49.607
to take one of their
grunting naps on my bed...

12:49.675 --> 12:50.675
hang on.

12:50.742 --> 12:52.943
Are you sneaking in here
and working?

12:53.011 --> 12:54.344
I know how much
you all need me...

12:54.412 --> 12:55.879
stop right there.
Guess what.

12:55.946 --> 12:57.713
Other people can figure out
how to sort the mail

12:57.781 --> 12:59.715
and answer the phones...
we don't need you.

12:59.783 --> 13:02.686
So move on with your life,
starting now.

13:08.428 --> 13:10.629
That is called tough love.

13:10.697 --> 13:13.366
Kenneth is now on a journey
that will either return him here

13:13.434 --> 13:15.937
where he belongs or end...

13:16.005 --> 13:17.674
In his death.

13:17.741 --> 13:20.978
Juggling is easier
than it looks.

13:21.046 --> 13:23.080
No. It is true.
They're doing it.

13:23.147 --> 13:25.315
Oh.

13:25.383 --> 13:26.983
And we have this just in to us.

13:27.051 --> 13:29.085
Ritchie and Liz
spotted in tree.

13:29.153 --> 13:30.552
Eyewitnesses report

13:30.620 --> 13:33.521
K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

13:33.589 --> 13:36.457
For more, let's go
to NBC's Andrea Mitchell.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.359
Thank you, Brian.

13:38.427 --> 13:39.427
Slut.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.101
Who do you think you are?

13:48.168 --> 13:49.569
Ritchie Tamuto,

13:49.636 --> 13:52.071
islanders fan
and role-playing slave owner.

13:52.138 --> 13:53.972
I know what you've been
saying about me...

13:54.040 --> 13:55.573
that we're sleeping together?

13:55.641 --> 13:56.775
You know what, Ritchie?

13:56.842 --> 13:58.876
I'm actually seeing someone
right now,

13:58.944 --> 14:00.544
and he's never around,
'cause he's a pilot.

14:00.612 --> 14:01.912
His name is Carol.

14:01.980 --> 14:03.180
That sounds really fake.

14:03.247 --> 14:04.914
I know how it sounds.

14:04.982 --> 14:06.782
And Carol is the reason
I was nice to you,

14:06.849 --> 14:09.084
because for once in my life,
I felt like being nice.

14:09.151 --> 14:11.452
Well, I don't care
how you punish my show.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.921
It's over.
I take my hug back.

14:13.988 --> 14:16.256
No, l-Liz, that is not
why I did it.

14:16.324 --> 14:17.557
Oh, "reallo"?
I meant to say "really."

14:17.624 --> 14:19.625
I misspoke.
Continue.

14:19.693 --> 14:20.793
Oh.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.995
Come here,
come here, come here.

14:26.531 --> 14:28.031
Liz, are you familiar
with the phrase

14:28.099 --> 14:29.766
"when it rains, it pours"?

14:29.833 --> 14:32.034
I don't meet a lot of women.

14:32.102 --> 14:34.069
Now, I started doing
fantasy hockey camp

14:34.136 --> 14:36.637
and civil war re-creationism
to meet girls.

14:36.705 --> 14:38.072
But I don't know
where they are.

14:38.140 --> 14:40.041
So...Yes.

14:40.109 --> 14:42.210
When you were nice to me,
I took advantage of it

14:42.278 --> 14:44.812
to try to make
someone else notice.

14:44.880 --> 14:45.946
Who?

14:46.014 --> 14:48.682
My assistant editor...

14:48.750 --> 14:50.417
Donna.

14:50.484 --> 14:52.118
Oh, for seven years,

14:52.186 --> 14:56.422
I've been sitting close enough
to touch her...

14:56.489 --> 14:58.556
But a million miles away.

14:58.624 --> 15:01.192
I am really sorry
that I did what I did.

15:01.260 --> 15:05.265
But it's just that
I am in love with her.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.134
I love her so much.

15:07.201 --> 15:09.569
Oh, Donna!

15:09.637 --> 15:11.638
Donna Straunk!

15:11.705 --> 15:14.373
All right,
I'll make you a deal.

15:16.802 --> 15:18.971
So many memories.

15:20.806 --> 15:22.874
Hello. Parcell
and a squatter's residence.

15:22.942 --> 15:25.009
Where the hell is Tracy Jordan!

15:25.077 --> 15:28.145
Mrs. Jordan?
Oh, I don't...

15:28.212 --> 15:31.380
I'm out of my mind
on a lot of drugs right now.

15:31.448 --> 15:33.116
Drugs during childbirth?

15:33.184 --> 15:35.151
Isn't the whole point
feeling God punish you?

15:35.219 --> 15:38.288
If that man is not
here for this, it is over!

15:38.355 --> 15:40.756
You hear me?

15:44.897 --> 15:47.265
The lazy Susan was invented
by Thomas Jefferson.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.901
I know, 'cause I'm a descendant
of Thomas Jefferson

15:49.968 --> 15:52.269
and lazy Susan herself!

15:52.337 --> 15:54.271
The capital
of the United Arab Emirates

15:54.339 --> 15:55.438
is Abu Dhabi.

15:55.506 --> 15:57.373
I know that,
because if I go back there,

15:57.441 --> 15:58.707
I'll be executed.

15:58.775 --> 16:00.743
There are 12 tones
in the chromatic scale.

16:00.811 --> 16:05.047
♪ I know that because
I'm a musical genius ♪

16:05.115 --> 16:07.015
- This is how you throw a punch.
- Wait... what?

16:07.083 --> 16:10.584
"And the tree was happy."

16:10.652 --> 16:12.684
Shel silverstein
was a communist.

16:12.752 --> 16:15.550
And that...
Is the art of camouflage.

16:15.618 --> 16:17.419
And this is how
you make love to a woman.

16:17.486 --> 16:19.054
Aah!

16:19.121 --> 16:20.555
Aah!

16:20.623 --> 16:22.590
Pull, Angie, pull!

16:22.657 --> 16:24.725
I knew you wouldn't let
me down, baby.

16:24.792 --> 16:26.292
Of course not, woman.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.260
I'm your husband.
Damn it!

16:28.327 --> 16:30.363
I got to go feed the meter.

16:30.430 --> 16:31.565
Aah!

16:31.633 --> 16:33.667
Aah!

16:35.269 --> 16:36.503
Oh, hey, Ritchie.

16:36.570 --> 16:39.272
Are we still on for
the music concert this weekend?

16:39.339 --> 16:41.975
Liz, we need to talk...
About us.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.377
Liz, we've had a lot of fun.

16:44.445 --> 16:45.378
End it? Why?

16:45.446 --> 16:46.947
But I need to end it.

16:47.015 --> 16:48.249
End it? Why?

16:48.317 --> 16:50.017
Without you around,

16:50.085 --> 16:52.686
who's gonna satisfy
my sex needs... and then some?

16:52.754 --> 16:54.421
Oh, Liz...

16:54.489 --> 16:56.423
You'll find someone.

16:56.490 --> 16:57.857
No, I won't,
not someone like you.

16:57.925 --> 17:01.427
How many guys out there have
a fully loaded Toyota tercel

17:01.495 --> 17:03.428
or a real pinball machine?

17:03.496 --> 17:05.630
How many guys
have been to Canada...

17:05.698 --> 17:06.664
Twice?

17:06.732 --> 17:08.098
Are you doing this to me

17:08.166 --> 17:10.902
because I don't share
your love of unicorns?

17:10.970 --> 17:13.237
Oh, Liz, don't blame yourself.

17:13.305 --> 17:14.472
It's my fault.

17:14.539 --> 17:17.375
See you in another life, kiddo.

17:19.310 --> 17:22.078
I guess some other woman
will get to enjoy that water bed

17:22.146 --> 17:25.047
that you're saving up for.

17:28.887 --> 17:31.722
What's up, Ritchie?

17:35.694 --> 17:37.194
Congratulations.
We're here, Tracy.

17:37.262 --> 17:38.896
You made it!
Tracy Jordan... hero,

17:38.964 --> 17:41.801
husband, diabetic/alcoholic!

17:41.868 --> 17:43.302
Yes!

17:43.370 --> 17:44.770
Hold on.
Let me unlock it for ya.

17:44.838 --> 17:46.138
Am I pulling it right?

17:46.206 --> 17:47.773
- Just let go of the handle.
- Okay.

17:47.841 --> 17:49.808
It's still not opening.
Stop pulling it.

17:49.876 --> 17:51.109
I'm trying to pull.
You keep saying "pull."

17:51.177 --> 17:52.611
Tracy, if you're pulling on it

17:52.678 --> 17:54.813
while I'm hitting the button...
What do you want me to do?

17:54.881 --> 17:56.782
Yelling at me
ain't gonna make it better!

17:56.849 --> 17:58.750
- Stop pulling on it!
- I'm freaking out!

17:58.818 --> 17:59.951
Good God!

18:00.019 --> 18:01.352
What's wrong with it?

18:01.420 --> 18:03.788
Oh, it's upside down.
My bad.

18:03.856 --> 18:05.790
Well, Angie, you did it.

18:05.858 --> 18:07.592
We did it.
I was here for you...

18:07.659 --> 18:09.627
'Cause I love you, baby.

18:09.694 --> 18:11.495
And I will always
be by your side

18:11.563 --> 18:14.632
no matter what discovery channel
game show stands in my way.

18:14.700 --> 18:16.667
I wouldn't have missed
whatever just happened here

18:16.734 --> 18:17.834
for anything.

18:17.902 --> 18:21.704
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

18:21.771 --> 18:23.838
And I mean it.

18:23.906 --> 18:25.873
Why's that baby
covered with goop?

18:25.941 --> 18:28.476
'Cause everything
about this is disgusting.

18:28.543 --> 18:29.877
As you go through life,

18:29.945 --> 18:32.545
I will always be here for you
through these tapes.

18:32.613 --> 18:35.247
Also, I have given a great deal
of money to the catholic church

18:35.315 --> 18:37.982
and have been assured
that I will have certain powers

18:38.050 --> 18:39.151
in heaven...

18:39.218 --> 18:42.486
sending messages
through animals, for instance.

18:42.553 --> 18:44.721
In the unlikely event
that you encounter something

18:44.789 --> 18:46.256
that is not covered here,

18:46.323 --> 18:47.624
find a woman named

18:47.691 --> 18:50.261
Elizabeth Lemon,
get her advice,

18:50.329 --> 18:51.996
and then do the opposite.

18:54.599 --> 18:57.168
Mr. Donaghy, I am sorry,
but you are wrong, sir.

18:57.235 --> 18:58.536
I am needed here...

18:58.603 --> 19:00.437
More than I ever knew.

19:00.504 --> 19:03.538
Very well.
I'll let h.R. Know.

19:03.606 --> 19:05.538
No, sir.
If I'm going to return,

19:05.606 --> 19:07.704
it must be
through the proper channels.

19:07.772 --> 19:11.336
I'm going to reapply
to the NBC page program,

19:11.404 --> 19:14.368
following standard procedures
for acceptance.

19:14.435 --> 19:16.168
You do whatever
you want to, Kenneth.

19:16.235 --> 19:18.001
I won't let you down, sir.

19:18.069 --> 19:20.233
I really don't care.

19:22.668 --> 19:24.401
Your ability to hide
your true feelings

19:24.468 --> 19:26.301
is part of your great strength.

19:29.171 --> 19:31.037
You ready for this, Jackie d?

19:31.105 --> 19:34.340
As of today, yes.
I made all my videotapes.

19:34.408 --> 19:36.042
Explain.

19:36.109 --> 19:37.510
I'm not gonna be around
forever, Tracy,

19:37.577 --> 19:39.411
so I recorded advice
for every scenario

19:39.479 --> 19:40.713
my son could face.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.881
Jackie D,
you want to make God laugh?

19:42.949 --> 19:44.682
Make a plan...

19:44.750 --> 19:46.017
Or read him a Dave Barry book.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.419
You're worrying
about being old, Jack?

19:48.487 --> 19:50.454
You could live forever,

19:50.521 --> 19:54.357
but you still can't predict
what happens in life.

19:54.425 --> 19:56.159
Wait a minute.

19:56.226 --> 19:57.994
There's no baby in here.

19:58.061 --> 19:59.595
Good God!

19:59.663 --> 20:01.363
Oh, she's in the crib.

20:01.431 --> 20:03.098
Good.

20:06.334 --> 20:07.768
Avery, I'm with Tracy.

20:07.836 --> 20:10.371
- We're having a damn girl!
- What?

20:10.439 --> 20:12.575
That Russian skank
read the ultrasound wrong.

20:12.643 --> 20:14.077
Oh! I'm just so worried

20:14.145 --> 20:17.347
about her spatial reasoning
and upper-body strength.

20:17.415 --> 20:19.383
Jack, talk me down.

20:19.450 --> 20:20.717
I'm having a girl!

20:20.785 --> 20:22.752
I hate to say I told you so...

20:22.820 --> 20:25.688
So welcome to Miami.

20:25.756 --> 20:27.356
I've gotta make new tapes.

20:27.357 --> 20:30.357
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.Addic7ed.Com</font>

20:30.794 --> 20:31.994
My daughter...

20:32.462 --> 20:34.929
I am John Francis Donaghy.

20:34.997 --> 20:36.297
I am your father.

20:36.465 --> 20:39.268
If you have the blondness
and self-esteem of your mother,

20:39.336 --> 20:41.038
you will need no advice.

20:41.105 --> 20:42.441
Life will be easy for you.

20:42.508 --> 20:44.878
Otherwise, I'd like
to introduce you to...

20:44.946 --> 20:45.814
Elizabeth Lemon.

20:45.882 --> 20:47.384
Good afternoon.
Let's jump in.

20:47.452 --> 20:50.022
Every human has hair
on his or her face.

20:50.090 --> 20:52.093
Some of us just have more.

20:52.161 --> 20:53.528
I think it's nice
to occasionally splurge

20:53.596 --> 20:54.997
on a straight-razor shave.

20:55.065 --> 20:56.633
If you're running low
on laundry,

20:56.701 --> 20:59.270
a bathing suit makes perfectly
acceptable underwear.

20:59.338 --> 21:02.073
Bandanas are a fun,
sexy fashion accessory.

21:02.141 --> 21:03.809
- This is over.
- Let me give my reasons.

21:03.876 --> 21:05.744
Put potato chips on a sandwich!
