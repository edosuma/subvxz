WEBVTT

00:00.522 --> 00:03.307
Previously, on "Below Deck"...

00:03.351 --> 00:05.048
Rayna, can you be a
bit quicker, please?

00:05.092 --> 00:06.571
I'm bringing all the dishes
to the galley.

00:06.615 --> 00:08.269
No, you're not
pulling your weight.

00:08.312 --> 00:09.487
Rethink the way you talk to me.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.141
Oh, so tired.

00:11.185 --> 00:13.100
I have been in
yachting five years,

00:13.143 --> 00:14.492
but last year
I've been helping care

00:14.536 --> 00:16.364
for my elderly grandparents.

00:16.407 --> 00:19.628
It's ----ing exhausting being
a stewardess all day long.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.021
This is, like, so much.

00:22.457 --> 00:23.588
Fender cover's lost.

00:23.632 --> 00:25.634
Oh, man, we lost a cover!

00:25.677 --> 00:27.288
Jesus Christ.

00:27.331 --> 00:30.334
It is not acceptable to have
things flying overboard.

00:30.378 --> 00:31.422
Are you going for anyone?

00:31.466 --> 00:32.467
No.

00:33.468 --> 00:34.730
Oh, you're gay, then?

00:34.773 --> 00:36.558
Yeah, just have to find
a guest, I guess.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.781
I didn't pick up
and, like, smack her ass.

00:42.825 --> 00:44.522
I just, like, picked her up and,
like, dropped her in the water.

00:50.093 --> 00:51.355
Does anybody handle
this sh-- well?

00:52.356 --> 00:54.054
I'm engaged.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.534
You're engaged,
and you didn't tell me that?

00:56.578 --> 00:57.840
Well, technically.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.146
You stuck your tongue
down my throat

00:59.189 --> 01:00.190
and you don't wanna say nothing?

01:02.410 --> 01:04.368
What the [bleep]?

01:33.180 --> 01:35.399
Oh sh--.

01:35.443 --> 01:38.402
Even if I try to close my eyes,
my head is just spinning.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.364
Why?

01:46.323 --> 01:48.282
I keep forgetting you've
got a girlfriend as well.

01:58.466 --> 02:01.556
I was, like, oh, my God,
are you serious?

02:01.599 --> 02:04.254
Yeah, this hangover's
going great so far.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.215
How you doing there, rock star?

02:08.258 --> 02:10.217
----ing epic.

02:10.260 --> 02:11.435
A ----ing epic night, right?

02:11.479 --> 02:13.568
- Yeah.
- Fun.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.398
All right, your cereal, sir.

02:17.441 --> 02:18.399
Thanks so much.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.183
How was your night last night?

02:20.227 --> 02:21.924
Good, I turned in a little bit
earlier than the rest.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.621
I'm a little too old
for all that jazz.

02:23.665 --> 02:25.275
I'm old.
You're not old.

02:25.319 --> 02:26.320
I'm feeling it, though.

02:27.364 --> 02:28.844
Wash her down?

02:28.887 --> 02:30.846
Wash her the down,
she's a dirty girl.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.500
Sounds like a great day.

02:32.543 --> 02:34.197
Heather.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.198
Oh, there you are, love.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.722
A day that starts in sunglasses.

02:37.766 --> 02:39.724
- Good night, though.
- I had a blast.

02:39.768 --> 02:41.552
What an absolute hoot.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.293
There's also a bagel
in my bathroom.

02:43.337 --> 02:45.208
- No!
- Yeah.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.428
Last night, we saw
a new side to Heather.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.911
It was really nice to watch her
having such a good time.

02:52.955 --> 02:57.394
I really hope
that Heather keeps this up.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.266
Naughty little bitch.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.442
- So, for today...
- Yes.

03:01.485 --> 03:04.401
Let's just make the beds and
the rooms as best we can.

03:04.445 --> 03:07.622
All right, pray for no peeking,
one, two, three.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.493
Pray for no peeking.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.975
Mr. Jake is engaged.

03:13.018 --> 03:14.890
Buddy, buddy,
you're engaged?

03:16.761 --> 03:18.807
If I was engaged and
you was kissing on everybody

03:18.850 --> 03:21.244
and they mama, I would
feel some type of way.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.290
She's my fiancÃ©,
but she's not my girlfriend.

03:24.987 --> 03:27.424
What the absolute [bleep]?

03:27.468 --> 03:31.254
Isn't that something you wanna
bring up the first day we meet?

03:33.691 --> 03:35.302
That's crazy.

03:35.345 --> 03:37.652
How did this happen?
Please tell us, play-by-play.

03:37.695 --> 03:40.307
She's my mate.
She needs a British passport.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.352
Ah!

03:55.713 --> 03:56.932
So, has she messed
with other people

03:56.975 --> 03:58.673
since you guys
have been together?

03:58.716 --> 04:00.370
Well, we're not together,
she's not my girlfriend.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.938
- I told you this.
- I don't understand.

04:02.981 --> 04:06.724
Oof, oh, this smells so bad.

04:06.768 --> 04:10.032
Blegh.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.599
Something I noticed
last night...

04:13.601 --> 04:16.560
I feel like everyone's
after a little bit of Jake.

04:16.604 --> 04:18.345
He's so cute, though.

04:18.388 --> 04:19.563
He's telling me
that you've got a little bit

04:19.607 --> 04:20.869
of a crush on Jake as well.

04:20.912 --> 04:23.350
No, no, no,
I'm out of a

04:23.393 --> 04:25.308
long-term, very serious
relationship.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.440
Yeah, you're pretty
fresh out of it, hey?

04:26.483 --> 04:28.311
Yeah, like,
I really thought

04:28.355 --> 04:30.270
that we were gonna get married,
we started our life.

04:30.313 --> 04:33.360
But unfortunately, he was, like,
"I don't think this is working."

04:33.403 --> 04:35.057
It was ----ing painful.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.320
I really loved and adored
him and respected him

04:37.364 --> 04:39.409
and had feelings for him,

04:39.453 --> 04:41.716
and wanted to have
a future with him.

04:41.759 --> 04:45.807
So, it...
I had to regroup.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.549
But I didn't have the ability
to actually process it until,

04:48.592 --> 04:50.725
like, I finished
my charter season.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.422
Then it hit me
like a son of a bitch.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.381
I'm happier now by myself.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.470
Like, when I was with him,

04:56.513 --> 04:58.776
I put his needs and
everything else before mine.

04:58.820 --> 05:01.388
And when I hear people
talk about their relationsh--,

05:01.431 --> 05:04.521
I'm just thinking to myself,
I'm like that.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.915
And then I just run to
my job as a protection.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.699
At least you're not
resorting to alcohol or drugs,

05:08.743 --> 05:10.092
- do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.615
You're resorting to work
and making money.

05:11.659 --> 05:13.748
Oh, God, being hungover
doing this is not fun.

05:13.791 --> 05:14.879
- Eddie.
- Yeah?

05:14.923 --> 05:16.359
Tell us about your girlfriend.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.100
She's a very,
very sweet, sweet woman.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.580
Aw!

05:19.623 --> 05:21.408
Very, very loving, very kind.

05:21.451 --> 05:22.583
- She crazy?
- Batsh--.

05:22.626 --> 05:23.932
Those are the best.

05:23.975 --> 05:25.586
This morning I'm bummed that,

05:25.629 --> 05:27.588
you know, my girlfriend's
pissed off at me.

05:27.631 --> 05:29.372
A little frustrating,
but it's a new relationship,

05:29.416 --> 05:31.766
and it's tough to trust
the other person

05:31.809 --> 05:34.682
that they're not gonna
hurt you and lie to you

05:34.725 --> 05:36.031
and burn you and cheat on you.

05:36.074 --> 05:38.512
So, this is how my life
is gonna be.

05:38.555 --> 05:39.774
Okay.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.645
Eddie, Heather, and Rachel,

05:41.689 --> 05:44.605
a brief meeting
in the crew mess.

05:44.648 --> 05:45.910
Greetings and salutations,
Captain.

05:45.954 --> 05:48.565
Hi.

05:48.609 --> 05:51.438
We have co-primaries,
Jeremy Morton and Ronnie Weiss.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.483
They're friends who
are bringing their families

05:53.527 --> 05:55.833
together to share this charter
of a lifetime.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.487
The Mortons are gonna
be joined by their sons,

05:57.531 --> 06:00.795
16-year-old Sam
and six-year-old Alexander.

06:00.838 --> 06:02.971
So, it sounds like
babysitting for somebody.

06:03.014 --> 06:04.146
Mm-hmm.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.669
I love having kids on board.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.498
Sometimes it can be
a huge pain in the ass.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.674
You gotta make the table,
make the beds,

06:10.718 --> 06:13.764
make the cocktails,
and wipe the kid's ass.

06:13.808 --> 06:16.419
Five-star service and a nanny.

06:16.463 --> 06:19.117
- Casino Royale party.
- On night one.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.032
They would like
to invite me to dinner.

06:21.076 --> 06:24.819
Day two... Ronnie will be
celebrating his 75th birthday

06:24.862 --> 06:26.951
with an '80s dance
and fitness party.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.389
Pretty sure they asked for
you to be there for that, Cap.

06:29.432 --> 06:31.652
You hold your breath till
I show up, all right?

06:31.695 --> 06:34.481
Noon pickup; let's start
prepping for it, thank you.

06:34.524 --> 06:35.525
Thanks, Cap.

06:37.788 --> 06:39.573
Hmm, hmm, hmm!

06:44.969 --> 06:47.145
I just wanna let you know that
the washing machine is done.

06:47.189 --> 06:48.886
I just don't want the
two of us doing it,

06:48.930 --> 06:50.192
- so it doesn't get mixed up.
- Can I switch with you?

06:50.235 --> 06:51.715
Can I switch with
you for a second?

06:51.759 --> 06:53.021
Yeah, and then what
we're gonna do...

06:53.064 --> 06:54.675
yes, and then
I'm gonna finish with...

06:54.718 --> 06:55.806
I got it, babe,
don't worry about it.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.417
...the fridge.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.679
But yeah, I just didn't
want two of us on it.

06:58.722 --> 06:59.680
Yep, do whatever
you'd like, love.

06:59.723 --> 07:02.509
All right.

07:02.552 --> 07:07.122
It's crucial that with a small
team we all carry our weight.

07:07.165 --> 07:09.429
Jess, she's had more
sleep than everyone else,

07:09.472 --> 07:11.082
and yet she is
the most miserable

07:11.126 --> 07:12.519
and rundown out of all of us.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.172
I'm doing her job
as well as mine.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.696
She needs to man the up,

07:15.739 --> 07:18.525
do the job,
and just stop complaining.

07:18.568 --> 07:22.050
Oh, my God, she has nailed this
bed, apart from the corners.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.749
<i>Craft services.</i>

07:25.793 --> 07:27.447
This is Heather
from motor yacht Seanna.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.492
We're gonna be doing
a casino royale party.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.494
I'm looking to get
some hanging dÃ©cor,

07:31.538 --> 07:35.672
10 decks of cards,
maybe a casino sign.

07:35.716 --> 07:37.587
Awesome, thank you so
much for your help.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.546
All right, we gotta start
making a move on now,

07:39.589 --> 07:41.722
because last time, we were
way ahead of what we are now.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.724
I love the enthusiasm,
it's great.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.552
- It's our job, isn't it, so...
- It's not that serious.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.554
Like, you get mad over
the smallest things.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.817
I'm not mad, I'm just trying
to get you to make a move on.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.471
What does it look
like we're doing?

07:51.514 --> 07:52.994
We don't need to go that fast.

07:53.037 --> 07:54.082
This isn't like
your normal sailing.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.562
This is super-yachting.

07:55.605 --> 07:56.737
Everything's gotta
be done quick.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.173
Jake brings up petty stuff.

07:58.216 --> 08:00.480
Rushing us around,
I get during charter.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.612
When we're not on charter,
what's the rush?

08:02.656 --> 08:04.571
outta here, guy.

08:04.614 --> 08:06.573
I don't wanna be doing
this when the sun's down.

08:06.616 --> 08:07.922
It's nothing to be upset
about, I'm just saying.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.097
- I'm not upset.
- You're hostile.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.490
Work faster.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.761
Wes, have you thought
about talking to Jess?

08:20.804 --> 08:22.066
Yeah, I've thought about it.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.546
I don't...
I don't know.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.505
I don't do that on boats.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.855
It's so close,
it's too tight-knit.

08:27.898 --> 08:28.856
So, you would never
have sex with Jess?

08:28.899 --> 08:30.553
No, didn't say that.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.816
I definitely have a fear
of rejection, who doesn't.

08:32.860 --> 08:35.602
No, I would.
I would.

08:35.645 --> 08:36.907
I definitely would.

08:36.951 --> 08:38.605
I was rejected
a lot in high school,

08:38.648 --> 08:40.128
little bit in college,
and that hurts.

08:40.171 --> 08:42.086
No game.
None whatsoever.

08:42.130 --> 08:46.047
I'm a big nerd,
and I get awkward, very clammy.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.701
I think you should try
to pursue it.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.007
I had so much fun.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.139
You guys are all very awesome.

08:51.182 --> 08:52.836
What happened with Jess and Wes?

08:52.880 --> 08:54.795
- What was the question?
-"Who would you kiss?"

08:54.838 --> 08:58.146
- And he was like, "Jess."
- Jess, Jess, Jess!

08:58.189 --> 09:00.757
Woo!

09:00.801 --> 09:02.237
How do you think
she feels about that?

09:02.280 --> 09:03.281
I don't know.

09:03.325 --> 09:04.761
Jess needs some dick.

09:08.286 --> 09:09.549
But I think
it'd be good for her.

09:09.592 --> 09:10.593
- Anything to make her...
- Yeah.

09:10.637 --> 09:11.638
Is she pretty sad?

09:11.681 --> 09:12.856
Make her smile at the moment.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.989
Maybe we do need
Wes to make the move.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.817
Maybe we do.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.993
- We gotta plant that seed.
- And hope that a flower grows.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.560
- Can I go fresh up?
- Yeah, of course.

09:23.737 --> 09:26.000
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt,
dirt, dirt, dirt.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.959
This is why I hate sand.

09:29.003 --> 09:31.832
I want to discuss
about Jess for a bit.

09:31.875 --> 09:34.008
She's just, like,
moping around as if,

09:34.051 --> 09:36.010
- like, she's pure misery.
- Right.

09:36.053 --> 09:37.968
And it's just everything she
does, there's a sigh before it.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.754
And I'm not gonna keep trying to
pull her up and get shot down.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.320
Yeah.

09:42.364 --> 09:45.019
I definitely think
Fraser's concerns are valid.

09:45.062 --> 09:48.370
It only takes one bad apple
to rot an entire tree.

09:48.413 --> 09:51.895
If she starts to take Fraser
out at the knees, then what?

09:51.939 --> 09:53.636
Definitely gonna have a
chat with her today,

09:53.680 --> 09:56.596
hoping that it leads for
a better charter number three,

09:56.639 --> 09:58.641
or we're gonna have
some big issues after that.

10:00.687 --> 10:01.905
Coming up...

10:01.949 --> 10:02.993
We have five minutes
to guest arrival.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.691
- Ugh!
- Ooh.

10:04.734 --> 10:07.128
That's a problem.

10:07.171 --> 10:08.738
<i>Is there a reason
I'm the only one out here?</i>

10:18.182 --> 10:19.706
Ah!

10:26.451 --> 10:28.279
There you go.

10:28.323 --> 10:29.759
Why don't you help us clear
that sink for Chef Rachel?

10:32.457 --> 10:33.763
Yeah, it's just I've been
trying to make them work faster,

10:33.807 --> 10:35.678
and it's so difficult.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.158
Like, don't you wanna get this
sh-- done so we can be done?

10:37.201 --> 10:38.289
Yeah, I really
don't wanna sound like a dick.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.639
Yeah.

10:44.861 --> 10:46.167
Perfect.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.299
Jess, do you wanna come
with me into the master?

10:48.343 --> 10:49.474
- Okay.
- Wesley!

10:49.518 --> 10:50.911
Yeah, I'm coming, hang on.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.260
Come on!

10:52.303 --> 10:53.870
I just really wanted
to touch base with you.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.742
Yeah?

10:55.785 --> 10:57.482
Because I feel as if you're
a little under the weather,

10:57.526 --> 10:59.789
or down, and...

10:59.833 --> 11:01.399
- No.
- No?

11:01.443 --> 11:02.836
I'm good.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.402
I see it affect
the work a little.

11:04.446 --> 11:06.840
The more we know about things,
the easier it is...

11:06.883 --> 11:08.058
I don't want
it to affect the work.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.712
Is everything okay?

11:09.756 --> 11:11.322
I just found out that my
grandmother had a procedure,

11:11.366 --> 11:13.455
- which is a little worrisome.
- Yeah.

11:13.498 --> 11:16.719
I don't wanna get upset
and, like, cry on the boat,

11:16.763 --> 11:19.722
and I know I'll get upset,
because I'm already crying.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.333
I think I just got a
little taken back by that.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.335
I was in yachting for a while,

11:24.379 --> 11:25.989
and I didn't get
to see my grandparents

11:26.033 --> 11:29.079
when things started going
south with their health.

11:29.123 --> 11:30.820
I kinda took it
as the opportunity

11:30.864 --> 11:32.126
to come back to land.

11:34.389 --> 11:35.738
I like being there for them.

11:37.479 --> 11:39.263
That's all it is.

11:39.307 --> 11:41.831
I just wanna know how
to better help you.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.224
Yeah, I'm good,
and I'll tell you

11:43.267 --> 11:44.834
if I need something, honestly.

11:44.878 --> 11:48.185
I'm here, I'm present, I'm fine.

11:49.186 --> 11:50.187
Hello?

11:50.231 --> 11:51.275
Hello, missing you.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.755
Is it really nice being home?

11:52.799 --> 11:53.843
I can't...
oh, I can't wait.

11:53.887 --> 11:56.237
I'm gonna try and...

11:56.280 --> 11:58.021
I'm getting there,
I'm getting there.

11:59.893 --> 12:02.025
I washed, and all this,
just from here.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.245
- Okay.
- Rayna, crushin' it.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.812
Wrap it up, we're knockin' off.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.465
Anyway, darling,
I'm gonna call you later.

12:07.509 --> 12:08.989
<i>Okay, sounds good.</i>

12:12.253 --> 12:15.256
I'm organizing our cabin.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.347
Oh, that smells amazing.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.262
- Oh, it's so cozy!
- Oh!

12:21.305 --> 12:22.567
It's date night, Jake.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.874
- Cheers, mate.
- Cheers to life, hey?

12:24.918 --> 12:27.050
So, what we
were talking about last night,

12:27.094 --> 12:28.486
I thought you were straight.

12:28.530 --> 12:29.923
When did you come out?

12:29.966 --> 12:31.315
I came out to my mum when
I was 19.

12:31.359 --> 12:34.057
I was driving back
to university with her,

12:34.101 --> 12:37.452
and there was this story
on the radio about this guy

12:37.495 --> 12:39.802
who'd, like,
murdered eight people.

12:39.846 --> 12:43.414
And he, like, had eaten,
like, a few of them as well.

12:43.458 --> 12:46.243
It was a really dark,
horrible story.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.071
And my mum's like,
"Just so you know, Fras,

12:48.115 --> 12:52.946
I will always love you,
even if you eat people."

12:52.989 --> 12:56.819
I was like, oh this
is the sh--test segue ever.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.604
It was so hard for me
to get the courage

12:59.648 --> 13:04.609
to actually do it, but all
it took was a little push.

13:04.653 --> 13:07.438
It felt amazing to get that
off my chest for so many years.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.310
Thanks, Mum.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.007
She's so cute!

13:11.051 --> 13:12.313
Yeah, I'm really happy
in my life.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.880
- Yeah.
- Single, but happy.

13:13.923 --> 13:14.968
Yeah.

13:15.011 --> 13:17.187
All right, sweet dreams,
you all.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.841
Eight o'clock on deck.
I think that's reasonable.

13:18.885 --> 13:19.842
Sounds good.

13:27.328 --> 13:29.330
God almighty.

13:31.506 --> 13:32.986
----ing hell, I'm tired.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.291
Wakey-wakey!

13:34.335 --> 13:35.989
Mm, hands off the bacon.

13:36.032 --> 13:38.252
Fa-la-la-la.

13:38.295 --> 13:40.036
Every day, it's a choice.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.951
Am I gonna be happy today, or am
I gonna be a miserable sh--?

13:44.606 --> 13:48.828
I'm choosing to be happy today
and look like this all the time.

13:53.354 --> 13:56.923
My radio is gone.

13:56.966 --> 13:59.403
Does anyone have two radios,
by any chance?

13:59.447 --> 14:01.014
- No.
- No.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.581
Because mine is gone.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.453
----ing hell.

14:05.496 --> 14:09.109
I had one job...
hold on to my radio...

14:09.152 --> 14:10.327
and I can't even do that.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.416
If you are looking
for your radio,

14:12.460 --> 14:15.028
odds are I already have it.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.508
Get your sh-- together, Fraser.
Find your radio.

14:17.552 --> 14:18.553
This is not a joke.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.685
I don't wanna lose my job.

14:20.729 --> 14:23.471
âª Good morning

14:23.514 --> 14:24.515
How you doing, girl?

14:24.559 --> 14:25.995
Fabulous.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.692
I'm gonna bring those
napkins down,

14:27.736 --> 14:29.433
so maybe we can put them where
the draw towels were.

14:29.477 --> 14:30.913
And then just, like,
throughout the day,

14:30.957 --> 14:32.393
we could do, like,
one set at a time.

14:32.436 --> 14:33.698
I love this.

14:33.742 --> 14:36.092
All right, cool, beautiful.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.486
- It's ----ing windy today.
the wind.

14:38.529 --> 14:40.705
you, seam!

14:40.749 --> 14:42.272
Hi!

14:42.316 --> 14:43.665
There doesn't seem to
be a radio for me.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.319
<i>All crew, we have
some provisions.</i>

14:45.362 --> 14:46.929
I need you to take
care of the beds

14:46.973 --> 14:48.191
while I handle the provisions.

14:48.235 --> 14:49.453
Copy that.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.631
This is the good stuff.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.938
- Woo!
- Caviar.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.026
Woo!

14:57.070 --> 14:59.115
I'm sweating my booty off, yeah.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.334
Woo!

15:00.377 --> 15:02.205
Rawr.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.424
Escargot.

15:03.467 --> 15:04.991
Amazing.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.253
Oh, hell, no.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.342
Deck team, we have
a cycle bike here

15:08.385 --> 15:10.474
that we might need
some hands on.

15:10.518 --> 15:11.519
- Copy. <i>
- Eddie, Eddie, Lee.</i>

15:11.562 --> 15:12.563
Come on up to the wheelhouse.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.391
<i>On my way.</i>

15:14.435 --> 15:15.436
If you wanna grab it by the
handles this time, you can...

15:15.479 --> 15:17.220
yeah, there you go.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.700
- How is everybody working out?
- Everybody's doing good.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.745
Everybody got their
radios and stuff?

15:20.789 --> 15:22.269
Seems to.

15:22.312 --> 15:23.574
That's a good thing.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.968
Where could this
little bitch be?

15:27.100 --> 15:28.710
How's our boy Jake doing?

15:28.753 --> 15:30.190
- Damn hard worker.
- Good.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.974
- Right here is good.
- Yeah.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.584
You know, I think the
issues with last docking

15:33.628 --> 15:35.325
was just everything was
just happening too fast.

15:35.369 --> 15:36.587
I mean, the run times are
just so short around here,

15:36.631 --> 15:38.285
so maybe just next time,
in the future,

15:38.328 --> 15:39.982
we could just
drop her back a little bit,

15:40.026 --> 15:42.158
just so we have enough time
to get everything ready.

15:42.202 --> 15:44.334
I know that everyone
would appreciate it.

15:44.378 --> 15:47.990
Gosh, it's like every charter
it's like their first rodeo.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.165
We're on charter three.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.471
It was just too quick.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.038
I think they had plenty of time.

15:52.081 --> 15:54.388
Eddie needs to get
their attention.

15:54.431 --> 15:56.477
If you can't run
with the big dogs,

15:56.520 --> 15:58.522
you gotta keep your
puppy ass on the porch.

15:58.566 --> 16:01.090
- Are you on schedule?
- Yeah, we're on schedule.

16:01.134 --> 16:04.485
- Good, I like that.
- I like it too.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.796
Are you still looking
for your radio?

16:11.840 --> 16:13.407
Let's not.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.104
It's better we just keep
getting the boat ready.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.019
Attention all crew,
we have 15 minutes

16:17.063 --> 16:18.586
- to guest arrival.
me.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.242
<i>Let's get in our
whites and get ready.</i>

16:26.333 --> 16:29.031
- Okay!

16:29.075 --> 16:30.424
That works.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.252
It's gonna be one
of those charters.

16:32.295 --> 16:34.167
Attention all crew, we have
five minutes to guest arrival.

16:34.210 --> 16:37.083
<i>-I hope everybody's ready.</i>
- Nope, we're not.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.649
- Fraser?
- Yes, ma'am.

16:38.693 --> 16:40.042
Do you have the champagne?

16:40.086 --> 16:41.087
We just got
the five-minute call.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.175
That's a problem.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.048
<i>Is there a reason
I'm the only one out here?</i>

16:46.092 --> 16:47.615
Goddamn it.

16:50.139 --> 16:52.707
Let's get this party
started right now.

16:54.317 --> 16:55.362
You got it, buddy?

16:55.405 --> 16:57.842
- Hello!
- Hello!

16:57.886 --> 17:00.149
The kid has a case
handcuffed to his wrist.

17:00.193 --> 17:02.282
- Oh, God.
- Welcome on board.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.457
- Hi!
- Captain Lee.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.111
Jeremy, nice to meet you.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.112
You want me to take
that little basket from you

17:06.155 --> 17:07.156
so you can wipe your hands down?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.157
- Uh...
- No, he...

17:08.201 --> 17:09.289
I'm like the mini-primary.

17:09.332 --> 17:10.377
Ah.

17:14.381 --> 17:17.166
This is not the group that you
would think you'd see together.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.428
Apple juice.

17:18.472 --> 17:19.821
You guys look like you
got a great tan.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.214
I've been tan for 40 years.

17:22.737 --> 17:23.781
They're all different.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.174
- Todd.
- Todd.

17:25.218 --> 17:26.349
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.351
Wow, this is gonna
get interesting.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.527
Here's to the staff
of the My Seanna.

17:30.571 --> 17:33.617
Woo!

17:33.661 --> 17:35.358
Coming up...

17:35.402 --> 17:37.491
- All fenders in place.
- We'll take our stern line.

17:37.534 --> 17:40.798
I'm as nervous as a whore
in a front-row pew at church.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.887
You gotta put it forward.
You gotta take the stern off.

17:42.931 --> 17:44.150
Cap, you gotta
lift the stern off.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.761
Oh, my God.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.593
Here's to the staff
of the My Seanna.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.290
I'm eager to see
what's in that box.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.510
Ah!

17:57.728 --> 17:59.295
Whoa!

17:59.339 --> 18:02.342
Woo, tip money.
That's a nice stack of cash.

18:02.385 --> 18:03.952
All right, everyone,

18:03.995 --> 18:05.562
can we just be sure to
take care of this kid?

18:05.606 --> 18:06.563
We don't want him
falling overboard.

18:06.607 --> 18:07.869
Yeah.

18:07.912 --> 18:09.871
That kid is my primary,
screw the adults.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.786
I am gonna get this party
started right now.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.657
Heather will show you
around the boat.

18:13.701 --> 18:14.876
Perfect.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.184
We are gonna go
get into our polos.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.838
- ASAP.
- Copy.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.971
This is a great spot
for a sunset,

18:23.014 --> 18:24.581
where we like to
enjoy most of the meals.

18:24.625 --> 18:25.930
- Nice.
- Amazing.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.236
We're just gonna
check out the sundeck.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.411
Ronnie, how long
you've been tan?

18:28.455 --> 18:29.760
Since the '60s.

18:29.804 --> 18:32.198
The moms,
they're gonna be litty.

18:32.241 --> 18:33.460
Love 'em, fabulous.

18:33.503 --> 18:35.157
No one's back there to catch me.

18:35.201 --> 18:37.768
This is a gorgeous
lounging area.

18:37.812 --> 18:39.205
Ah, here's my hot tub.

18:39.248 --> 18:40.510
It's got my name on it.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.298
This is unreal.

18:45.341 --> 18:46.342
This is the master stateroom
on this level.

18:46.386 --> 18:47.387
You've got a conjoined bathroom.

18:47.430 --> 18:50.172
- Wow.
- Pretty nice.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.652
Whew.

18:51.695 --> 18:53.306
All right, let's see
if we can get outta here

18:53.349 --> 18:54.829
without spending any money.

18:54.872 --> 18:57.701
Let me know when that last
line is ready to come off.

18:57.745 --> 19:00.008
I get a knot in my stomach
every time I touch the controls

19:00.051 --> 19:01.879
to leave, because the
prevailing winds

19:01.923 --> 19:06.188
are constantly blowing us onto
the dock, which is concrete.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.276
We'll take our stern line.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.669
Forward bow line off.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.497
There's just shallow water
everywhere.

19:10.540 --> 19:14.327
I'm as nervous as a whore
in a front-row pew at church.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.633
<i>All fenders in place
until I clear.</i>

19:21.551 --> 19:23.292
Whew.

19:23.336 --> 19:24.511
You gotta put her forward.
You gotta take the stern off.

19:24.554 --> 19:25.773
Cap, you gotta lift
the stern off...

19:27.078 --> 19:29.342
- Whew!
- Woohoo!

19:29.385 --> 19:31.213
Oh, my God.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.954
All fenders are clear,
all fenders are clear.

19:32.997 --> 19:35.696
<i>Okay, we're outta here.</i>

19:35.739 --> 19:37.567
Who the ties these, man?

19:43.965 --> 19:47.011
You wanna make sure Alexander's
not to go by himself anywhere.

19:47.055 --> 19:48.709
No problem.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.450
We have more than
enough crew members.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.539
We will have our eyes
on you like a hawk.

19:52.582 --> 19:55.803
Oh, my gosh,
that seared my soul.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.805
Why, what's happening now?

19:57.848 --> 19:59.285
Why am I afraid all of a sudden?

19:59.328 --> 20:00.590
Awesome.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.462
Don't be afraid, you're my rock.

20:08.903 --> 20:09.817
Sure thing.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.036
Go, go, go.
Come on.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.038
Sorry, honey.
Going slow.

20:14.082 --> 20:15.344
Speed this sh-- up!

20:15.388 --> 20:17.259
Big bootie Judy coming our way.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.740
Did you say you've got
another, like,

20:19.783 --> 20:20.741
a project as well on board?

20:20.784 --> 20:22.743
Yeah, there's another one,

20:22.786 --> 20:24.440
but I'm gonna build that
probably tomorrow.

20:24.484 --> 20:27.095
I used to be a nanny,
so kids tend to like me.

20:27.138 --> 20:28.923
I know how to look after them.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.968
Yeah, I'm a... I'm a...
I'm a...

20:31.012 --> 20:32.927
I'm so good at LEGOs.

20:32.970 --> 20:35.669
But to be honest, yeah,
I don't like kids.

20:35.712 --> 20:37.758
The way they eat, the sounds...

20:40.717 --> 20:41.718
No, no.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.503
They're just a bit gross.

20:43.546 --> 20:46.332
I hate getting my nails clipped,
because if I was, like, kinda...

20:46.375 --> 20:47.637
Then you can't
take it off, yeah.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.073
- Yeah.
- I don't like kids one bit.

20:49.117 --> 20:50.336
So, how are you supposed
to get it off?

20:50.379 --> 20:52.033
I don't really know.

20:52.076 --> 20:53.730
For lunch, we're gonna do
the pan-seared local grouper.

20:53.774 --> 20:54.818
The kids will have
grilled chicken.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.603
We'll do sweet potato wedges.

20:56.646 --> 20:59.823
Then we're gonna do, like,
a big, massive Cobb salad.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.912
- That is nice.
- Thank you.

21:01.956 --> 21:03.436
See, this is great.

21:03.479 --> 21:07.614
Yes, I mean, look at
how beautiful that is.

21:07.657 --> 21:08.876
That's annoying as hell.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.356
Hot mama!

21:10.399 --> 21:11.574
We're gonna get some weather.

21:11.618 --> 21:14.011
Oh sh--.

21:14.055 --> 21:16.057
There was just a little bit
of a spritzle-sprinkle.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.624
Holy wind, dude.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.365
Oh, here, you take that,
and I'll take that.

21:19.408 --> 21:20.975
I'm gonna have to move
you guys all inside.

21:21.018 --> 21:22.455
Okay, I got you, I got you.

21:22.498 --> 21:23.456
- You got it?
- Get the other one.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.066
We're gonna do the ends?

21:25.109 --> 21:26.633
Oh, just one end, right there.

21:26.676 --> 21:27.677
Great.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.987
<i>Eddie, Eddie, Lee.</i>

21:33.030 --> 21:34.815
I'm less than five minutes
away from dropping the hook.

21:34.858 --> 21:36.817
Let's get somebody
up on the forward deck

21:36.860 --> 21:38.340
to prep for dropping the hook.

21:38.384 --> 21:39.733
<i>Copy that, I'm on my way.</i>

21:39.776 --> 21:40.995
I'll go do that.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.518
What's new?

21:45.782 --> 21:47.567
- Shall we sit?
- Someone else wanna have a go?

21:47.610 --> 21:48.916
Yeah.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.439
On my mark, I want
two and a half shots.

21:50.483 --> 21:52.006
Two and a half shots,
standing by.

21:52.049 --> 21:53.703
You're just gonna let it go,

21:53.747 --> 21:55.183
and then I'll tell you
when to close as well.

21:55.226 --> 21:56.663
Okay.

21:56.706 --> 21:58.708
If I can teach Rayna
a bit more on deck,

21:58.752 --> 22:01.015
maybe the job will seem
more appealing to her.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.365
So then we'll just let that
go, and then it'll be yellow?

22:03.409 --> 22:04.801
Or then it'll be red
and then yellow?

22:04.845 --> 22:06.716
It will be red,
but it'll be a bright red.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.022
I wanna be friends with her.

22:08.065 --> 22:09.545
I don't wanna
----ing be the villain.

22:09.589 --> 22:11.504
But if it doesn't work,

22:11.547 --> 22:13.549
I reckon I'm gonna make
Rayna walk the plank.

22:15.986 --> 22:18.728
- And drop.
- All the way.

22:21.035 --> 22:22.950
Here comes Ronnie,
bringing up the rear.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.995
All right, tomorrow's your
birthday party.

22:25.039 --> 22:27.998
The big 75.

22:28.042 --> 22:29.086
Two and a half shots.

22:29.130 --> 22:30.523
I like it.

22:30.566 --> 22:31.741
Sounds good to me.

22:31.785 --> 22:32.873
Let's lock it in.

22:32.916 --> 22:33.961
<i>Anchor's locked.</i>

22:34.004 --> 22:35.702
yeah.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.181
<i>Fraser, Fraser, Heather.</i>

22:41.098 --> 22:43.013
Oh, that's right,
he doesn't have a radio.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.627
Growing up,
I was terrible at school,

22:47.670 --> 22:49.455
and I was even worse at
university.

22:49.498 --> 22:53.502
School was tough because my dad
has worked the Olympic games,

22:53.546 --> 22:55.548
and I think moving countries

22:55.591 --> 22:57.854
every two to three years
is difficult.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.249
So, now that I found
something that I love

23:01.292 --> 23:03.860
and that I feel
like I'm very good at,

23:03.904 --> 23:07.908
the basic capacity
of keeping my radio on me

23:07.951 --> 23:10.693
and failing that makes me
feel like sh--.

23:10.737 --> 23:13.435
Come on, Fras, this is
not ----ing rocket science.

23:17.613 --> 23:19.136
Hey, I'm plating the boys
right now.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.703
Ready to roll.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.836
Wow, Sam.

23:22.879 --> 23:23.924
Here you go, so we've
got ketchup

23:23.967 --> 23:25.055
in the middle of the table.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.709
Honey mustard.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.015
This is so good.

23:28.058 --> 23:29.930
And I've got
some sweet potato fries.

23:29.973 --> 23:32.149
Sweet potato fries are amazing.

23:32.193 --> 23:33.237
Can I offer you some Cobb?

23:33.281 --> 23:34.978
- This is Dijon chicken.
- Please.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.676
- Delish.
- Mm!

23:36.719 --> 23:37.894
Ooh, this is good.

23:39.809 --> 23:40.810
We do.

23:40.854 --> 23:41.811
[bleep], I love you.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.639
It was amazing.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.032
- So, we'll go downstairs...
- And hang with the homies.

23:45.075 --> 23:47.295
Do do, do do, do do.

23:47.338 --> 23:50.907
Oh sh--.

23:50.951 --> 23:53.475
<i>Eddie, Eddie,
we may have lost the ball.</i>

23:54.520 --> 23:55.651
How?

23:55.695 --> 23:56.783
Jake did it, Jake did it,
not me.

23:56.826 --> 23:57.784
- Goddamn it.
- I'm sorry.

23:57.827 --> 23:59.002
Let it go.

23:59.046 --> 24:00.917
If I take off on the
----ing tender,

24:00.961 --> 24:02.136
Captain Lee's gonna notice that
something just went overboard.

24:02.179 --> 24:03.224
If something ----ing
goes overboard,

24:03.267 --> 24:04.747
unless it's something serious,

24:04.791 --> 24:05.922
don't say it over
the ----ing radio!

24:08.011 --> 24:09.535
The guests are all
preoccupied downstairs.

24:09.578 --> 24:10.579
I can handle it.

24:11.580 --> 24:12.538
I don't think so.

24:12.581 --> 24:13.582
You okay?

24:15.236 --> 24:16.193
You're scattered.

24:16.237 --> 24:18.108
I just want my radio.

24:18.152 --> 24:19.806
Okay, so let's just clear the
whole counter and laundry room,

24:19.849 --> 24:21.285
and see if
it's not in our space.

24:23.853 --> 24:26.290
I know you are.

24:26.334 --> 24:28.858
It's so vital that
Fraser finds his radio.

24:28.902 --> 24:30.643
Not only for safety reasons,

24:30.686 --> 24:32.688
but I need communication
with him

24:32.732 --> 24:34.995
as my second
for a successful charter.

24:35.038 --> 24:37.345
I don't care if you think
that it could or couldn't be,

24:37.388 --> 24:39.565
I want you to dig through
all of that stuff in there.

24:39.608 --> 24:41.828
Find it!
Find it right now!

24:41.871 --> 24:43.743
Dig through it,
just so that

24:43.786 --> 24:45.309
we've crossed everything
off the list.

24:47.790 --> 24:48.835
Coming up...

24:48.878 --> 24:50.184
There's a few things I would do.

24:50.227 --> 24:51.664
Always, like, kinda
straighten these things.

24:51.707 --> 24:53.579
Like, water spots
on this mirror.

24:53.622 --> 24:54.797
Pull them tighter.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.538
Cheap-ass hotels do
a better job

24:56.582 --> 24:58.148
than what my team
is producing right now.

24:58.192 --> 24:59.280
Training day's over.

25:06.722 --> 25:09.203
Gotta flip it around
the other way.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.987
God, I'm in a silly mood today.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.336
I don't know why.

25:15.426 --> 25:16.689
Yeah?

25:16.732 --> 25:19.387
You're funny.

25:19.430 --> 25:23.652
Oh, there is a ----ing
God looking down on me!

25:23.696 --> 25:25.567
Okay, panic over.

25:25.611 --> 25:29.223
It's crazy, how much that little
piece of plastic means to me.

25:29.266 --> 25:30.964
Heather, Heather, Fraser.

25:31.007 --> 25:32.052
<i>You are incredible.</i>

25:32.095 --> 25:33.706
----ing hell, that was close.

25:33.749 --> 25:36.230
Heather, I know
it's, like, casino,

25:36.273 --> 25:37.710
but what's the plan
as far as games?

25:37.753 --> 25:39.625
I've got two craps
and one poker.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.714
I've got the felt tops,
so we'll just lay them across.

25:41.757 --> 25:42.932
So, you have
a crap table, seriously,

25:42.976 --> 25:44.281
- with dice and everything?
- Yeah.

25:44.325 --> 25:46.109
That's...
How you gonna do the odds?

25:46.153 --> 25:47.720
Six the hard way, and...

25:47.763 --> 25:48.895
No, they have a craps table.

25:48.938 --> 25:50.810
- Oh, do they?
- Yeah.

25:50.853 --> 25:52.115
You wanna play before
or after dinner?

25:52.159 --> 25:53.900
- Before?
- Totally works.

25:53.943 --> 25:56.772
Wanna know what gave
me all this sh--.

25:56.816 --> 25:59.732
Let's put it in here
and call it a day.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.298
I wanna start
with the decorating.

26:01.342 --> 26:02.691
Yeah.

26:02.735 --> 26:04.171
So, we need to set
this up first.

26:04.214 --> 26:07.130
First time gambling was
at Atlantis in the Bahamas.

26:07.174 --> 26:09.916
Went with my
first charter tip ever,

26:09.959 --> 26:13.180
threw all my money on red,
and ----ing lost it all.

26:13.223 --> 26:15.356
It's a casino!

26:15.399 --> 26:17.184
I've learned to just take
a little bit of your money,

26:17.227 --> 26:18.968
not your whole tip with you,

26:19.012 --> 26:20.970
'cause it's an easy thing
to get caught up in.

26:22.145 --> 26:23.320
Are you out of air already?

26:23.364 --> 26:24.931
No, I'm lightheaded.

26:24.974 --> 26:27.150
I've got veins popping
out of every orifice.

26:27.194 --> 26:28.369
Oh, my God.

26:28.412 --> 26:29.979
What'd you do, then?

26:34.723 --> 26:36.246
Would you ever wanna do
something like this?

26:38.161 --> 26:41.034
Good fun.
Good fun.

26:42.383 --> 26:44.994
Ah.

26:45.038 --> 26:46.953
I've learned a lot from my
mistakes in relationships

26:46.996 --> 26:48.781
in the past, and my girlfriend,

26:48.824 --> 26:50.957
she is without a doubt the
most loving one I've ever met.

26:52.959 --> 26:55.135
Hey, I'm sorry about
last night, sweetie.

26:55.178 --> 26:57.137
And that was a speed bump,

26:57.180 --> 26:59.313
but it's not gonna define
the rest of our relationship.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.010
I know it's hard
on you, sweetie,

27:01.054 --> 27:02.185
but be cool, honey bunny.

27:02.229 --> 27:03.970
I miss you, too.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.798
Can you take a step back
from afar

27:05.841 --> 27:07.669
and tell me if it looks like...

27:07.713 --> 27:09.018
- No, you can't see.
- Hanging balls, or...

27:09.062 --> 27:10.237
I mean, it does
look like hanging balls,

27:10.280 --> 27:11.847
but it looks great.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.980
- That'll do.
- That'll do.

27:16.983 --> 27:18.332
Let's go, honey,
they're waiting for us.

27:18.375 --> 27:20.682
Hey, I'm making my hair good!

27:20.726 --> 27:22.336
What we're gonna
do is the antipasti

27:22.379 --> 27:23.816
- is gonna be on the table.
- Okay.

27:23.859 --> 27:24.991
- So, we have focaccia...
- Yeah.

27:25.034 --> 27:26.514
- Burrata, and then...
- Yeah.

27:26.557 --> 27:28.255
We'll go into the Caprese salad.

27:28.298 --> 27:30.344
Do pappardelle;
that will be plated.

27:30.387 --> 27:33.173
So, tonight's theme
is casino night,

27:33.216 --> 27:35.741
and I just lived in
Italy for almost eight months,

27:35.784 --> 27:37.438
and I had a wonderful
experience.

27:37.481 --> 27:40.920
So, I wanna have
a nice Italian feast.

27:40.963 --> 27:42.748
I can't stop doing this.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.318
Main fork and knife, and
you want a spoon and a fork.

27:48.362 --> 27:51.365
- Right, copy, copy.
- Grazie mille.

27:51.408 --> 27:52.409
You got tanned today.

27:52.453 --> 27:54.324
- I faded.
- You faded?

27:54.368 --> 27:58.241
He's been tan for 65 years.

27:58.285 --> 28:00.026
I have a disease
called tanorexia.

28:00.069 --> 28:01.201
Yeah, you gotta be tan, huh?

28:01.244 --> 28:02.506
Tanorexia.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.030
Vitamin D, baby, vitamin D.

28:04.073 --> 28:06.859
Vitamin N...
vitamin nice.

28:10.210 --> 28:11.820
How old were you when you
found this as your passion?

28:11.864 --> 28:13.387
Oh me, man,
let me tell you what,

28:13.430 --> 28:15.345
I was actually about 18.

28:15.389 --> 28:17.217
I ran my mouth as a bartender,

28:17.260 --> 28:18.914
and the boys in the kitchen
were like,

28:18.958 --> 28:20.742
"Hey, smartass,
why don't you put your money

28:20.786 --> 28:21.787
where your mouth is?"

28:21.830 --> 28:23.136
Oh.

28:23.179 --> 28:25.138
And I said, "----ing watch me,"
and that was it.

28:25.181 --> 28:27.009
What do you have for me?

28:27.053 --> 28:28.402
I can put Minecraft
on two player

28:28.445 --> 28:30.143
Show me.

28:30.186 --> 28:32.885
All right, so you guys wanna
play left, right, center?

28:32.928 --> 28:34.321
That's the pot.

28:34.364 --> 28:36.062
Heather's playing too.
Are you playing too?

28:36.105 --> 28:37.237
- We put in the money.
- You can play on the easy one.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.542
- I'll play the hard one.
- Okay.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.066
Let's go.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.502
For an amateur,
that's a sick roll.

28:41.545 --> 28:42.503
- Okay.
- There you go.

28:42.546 --> 28:44.505
Oh, that hurts.

28:46.463 --> 28:47.813
Jess, if I could get
you to go into the queen room

28:47.856 --> 28:49.075
and start in there.

28:49.118 --> 28:50.903
Okay, lovely.

28:50.946 --> 28:53.035
Yeah, I would do a sparkling,
and one of the chardonnays...

28:53.079 --> 28:54.297
- Yeah.
-...that are in the water.

28:54.341 --> 28:55.908
Because Todd drinks that.

28:57.953 --> 29:00.782
- Wow, that's insane.
- That is amazing!

29:00.826 --> 29:01.957
Take someone down.

29:02.001 --> 29:04.133
Tricky little bastard.

29:05.613 --> 29:07.006
Shall we sit for dinner?

29:07.049 --> 29:08.094
- Is it time? Sure.
- It's time.

29:08.137 --> 29:09.399
Hello.

29:09.443 --> 29:10.574
Are you ready for dinner?
Are you hungry?

29:10.618 --> 29:11.837
I am.
Oh, they look nice.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.056
Yeah, they are beautiful.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.449
I love to sit across from you,

29:15.492 --> 29:18.321
so I can gaze into
those big, brown eyes.

29:18.365 --> 29:19.845
Evening.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.542
- Hi!
- Hello, how are you?

29:21.585 --> 29:23.936
- Thank you for joining us.
- Thank you for having me.

29:23.979 --> 29:25.459
So good that you're here.

29:25.502 --> 29:27.853
This is prosciutto di Parma,
prosciutto di cotto...

29:27.896 --> 29:29.550
- What's the one again?

29:29.593 --> 29:32.335
- Taleggio.
- Here comes the food.

29:32.379 --> 29:33.336
- Wow.
- Look how gorgeous.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.337
Beautiful.

29:34.381 --> 29:35.425
Special pasta.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.297
Mm. Good.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.038
Are the rooms
downstairs all good?

29:39.081 --> 29:40.213
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

29:45.174 --> 29:46.828
What the hell?

29:46.872 --> 29:48.438
Seriously?
A mess.

29:48.482 --> 29:51.224
What's concerning me
the most about these cabins

29:51.267 --> 29:54.227
is the lack of
attention to detail.

29:54.270 --> 29:56.142
Jesus.

29:56.185 --> 29:58.100
Even cheap-ass hotels
do a better job

29:58.144 --> 30:00.102
than what my team
is producing right now.

30:00.146 --> 30:03.410
Ridiculous.
That is not okay.

30:03.453 --> 30:05.325
- Can I steal you for a few?
- Mm-hmm.

30:05.368 --> 30:06.979
Cool, let's go down
to the guest cabin.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.981
That wasn't ----ed up,
I'm so excited.

30:09.024 --> 30:10.460
That's made my night already.

30:10.504 --> 30:11.984
Are there still
pirates on the ocean?

30:12.027 --> 30:13.246
Yeah, there are.

30:13.289 --> 30:14.987
And for them, that's a career.

30:15.030 --> 30:16.510
So, there's
a few things I would do.

30:16.553 --> 30:18.512
I would always, like, kinda
straighten these things.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.601
Yeah, they came down there
and messed that up afterwards.

30:20.644 --> 30:22.342
And there's, like,
water spots on this mirror.

30:22.385 --> 30:23.996
Pull them tighter.

30:24.039 --> 30:25.693
If you're gonna put
your final stamp of, like,

30:25.736 --> 30:27.913
the rooms are all good, know
it was your last walkthrough.

30:27.956 --> 30:30.132
I'm insanely sympathetic
of everything Jess

30:30.176 --> 30:32.004
is going through with
her grandma right now,

30:32.047 --> 30:34.876
but people have to leave their
emotions at their cabin door.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.486
The Downy that's sitting here.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.227
I'm ----ing pissed.

30:40.751 --> 30:42.928
I specifically asked her first,
"Are cabins all done."

30:42.971 --> 30:44.625
She said, "Yes."

30:44.668 --> 30:46.192
When I came down and showed
her everything, she's like,

30:46.235 --> 30:48.020
"Oh, well, they were in
here, and they this,"

30:48.063 --> 30:49.108
and I said, "You can't say
somebody else just walked down."

30:49.151 --> 30:50.544
Yeah.

30:50.587 --> 30:52.024
Especially if all three rooms
had an issue.

30:52.067 --> 30:53.112
Trying to find
the right way to, like...

30:53.155 --> 30:54.287
- Right.
- Coach with inspiration.

30:54.330 --> 30:56.289
Yeah.

30:56.332 --> 30:57.943
But it's coming down to where,
like, training day's over.

30:57.986 --> 30:59.335
Wow.

31:00.510 --> 31:01.511
Coming up...

31:03.774 --> 31:05.385
Oh... your room's down there.

31:07.343 --> 31:08.954
Where are you going?

31:08.997 --> 31:10.738
Wow, you got those double doors?

31:10.781 --> 31:12.479
<i>Eddie, Eddie, Lee.</i>

31:16.222 --> 31:17.963
I love these dishes.

31:18.006 --> 31:19.486
That won't fit in your purse.

31:22.489 --> 31:25.144
Wow, absolute favorite
dish of mine.

31:28.538 --> 31:29.626
Ooh, yeah.

31:29.670 --> 31:31.150
Would you care for some Caprese?

31:31.193 --> 31:32.412
Yeah, a little bit.

31:32.455 --> 31:33.630
- It's good.
- Oh.

31:33.674 --> 31:34.805
How is it, Samuel?

31:34.849 --> 31:36.068
- It's good.
- Mm.

31:36.111 --> 31:37.765
This chef is amazing.

31:37.808 --> 31:40.550
- Wow, that is good.
- She is extremely talented.

31:40.594 --> 31:42.683
Ooh, there's some white
wine in that.

31:44.467 --> 31:45.686
I'm gonna bring this upstairs,

31:45.729 --> 31:48.428
so it looks like
I'm doing stuff.

31:48.471 --> 31:50.473
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow.

31:50.517 --> 31:53.172
Your soup tonight's done
with roasted heirloom tomatoes,

31:53.215 --> 31:55.652
a roasted red pepper,
along with a parmesan crisp.

31:55.696 --> 31:57.045
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.091
- The flavors.
- Mm!

31:59.134 --> 32:00.701
Todd?

32:00.744 --> 32:02.050
Goddamn.

32:02.094 --> 32:03.269
I don't know what's going on,

32:03.312 --> 32:04.618
but my underwear
keeps sliding down.

32:04.661 --> 32:07.099
Oh!

32:07.142 --> 32:09.188
We grew up in Michigan
on the lake, so...

32:09.231 --> 32:12.800
I left Michigan when I was
25 and never went back.

32:22.723 --> 32:24.681
Captain Lee, do you have a
family in Ft. Lauderdale?

32:24.725 --> 32:26.379
Wife, four kids.

32:26.422 --> 32:28.424
Oh, shoot.
Oh, sorry.

32:28.468 --> 32:30.078
- Serious?
- He's gorgeous.

32:30.122 --> 32:33.168
No. Stop it.
Makes me uncomfortable.

32:35.083 --> 32:37.433
Somewhere, my wife heard that,
and she's laughing her ass off.

32:37.477 --> 32:38.695
I'm sure... right.

32:38.739 --> 32:40.262
Am I in trouble
or are you in trouble?

32:40.306 --> 32:42.090
- They're nice people.
- I like them a lot.

32:42.134 --> 32:43.265
So, how are you today?

32:43.309 --> 32:44.484
Is there any problem?

32:44.527 --> 32:46.268
I don't think so.

32:46.312 --> 32:47.487
Kind of been trying to take
a different, like, approach.

32:47.530 --> 32:48.662
Yeah.

32:48.705 --> 32:50.272
And tried to be a
lot more chilled

32:50.316 --> 32:51.621
- and laid back, and not so...
- Okay.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.362
- Not so hot-headed.

32:53.406 --> 32:55.669
This team, we have so much
potential to be really good.

32:55.712 --> 32:57.279
I think we're doing good.

32:57.323 --> 33:00.108
Should we go and
get our stuff sorted?

33:00.152 --> 33:01.327
And then the rest of
the night is chill.

33:07.594 --> 33:08.856
That is definitely
my cup of tea.

33:08.899 --> 33:10.727
We're just gonna keep it coming.

33:10.771 --> 33:13.165
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow, thank you.

33:13.208 --> 33:15.210
Here we've got
some sautÃ©ed asparagus,

33:15.254 --> 33:16.559
poached egg with crisp pancetta.

33:16.603 --> 33:18.431
- Mm!
- Thank you so much.

33:18.474 --> 33:20.389
This is breakfast, we don't
have to eat breakfast tomorrow.

33:20.433 --> 33:22.217
Oh, speak for yourself.

33:22.261 --> 33:24.567
It's so good.

33:24.611 --> 33:26.395
Hey, she makin' a pasta.

33:26.439 --> 33:29.485
I make a pasta, with a semolina.

33:29.529 --> 33:32.575
Homemade pasta...
nothing compares.

33:32.619 --> 33:34.490
I really, really love
to take the time

33:34.534 --> 33:37.406
to make it from scratch,
make it authentic.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.365
Don't snag on me, bitch.

33:39.408 --> 33:42.368
I can't stand using boxed pasta.

33:42.411 --> 33:45.240
I'm like, bleagh...
can't do it.

33:45.284 --> 33:46.763
It's boiling, you're done.

33:46.807 --> 33:47.808
Yeah...

33:50.637 --> 33:52.552
Alexander, with his
chicken tenders today

33:52.595 --> 33:54.162
that Rachel made for him,

33:54.206 --> 33:57.731
I never saw him eat
chicken tenders that fast.

33:57.774 --> 33:59.385
Really?

33:59.428 --> 34:00.647
You can tell, everything
that's she's made today

34:00.690 --> 34:02.431
is just made with
love and passion.

34:02.475 --> 34:04.433
Suck my ----ing clit.

34:04.477 --> 34:06.609
I might have to change
into different pants.

34:06.653 --> 34:07.958
- So good.
- Hm.

34:08.002 --> 34:09.395
- Going.
- Going?

34:09.438 --> 34:10.396
Cheers, guys.

34:10.439 --> 34:11.571
Oh, I always do that on purpose.

34:11.614 --> 34:13.268
Oh [bleep], I'm sorry.

34:13.312 --> 34:14.791
No, it's all good.
I'll murder you later.

34:14.835 --> 34:16.793
Wow.

34:16.837 --> 34:19.666
Oh, my God, that's gorgeous.

34:19.709 --> 34:22.712
Your pasta course is a
quattro fungi con pappardelle.

34:22.756 --> 34:26.629
So, it's four mushrooms
sautÃ©ed with truffle as well.

34:26.673 --> 34:29.284
I've never had food like
this in my whole life.

34:29.328 --> 34:30.981
You're a freak of nature.

34:31.025 --> 34:32.809
My mother told me
I broke her uterus.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.724
Oh, my God.

34:34.768 --> 34:36.422
- It's delicious.
- Bon appÃ©tit.

34:36.465 --> 34:37.640
There's nothing better.

34:39.512 --> 34:40.904
He's out.

34:40.948 --> 34:42.428
That's the cutest thing
ever, leave him be.

34:42.471 --> 34:44.299
- It's so funny.
- So, what's this, then?

34:44.343 --> 34:46.258
- It's a panna cotta.
- Panna cotta.

34:46.301 --> 34:48.738
- We're all covered up, right?
- Yeah, everything's covered.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.653
- All right, folks.
- Good night.

34:50.697 --> 34:52.307
Fraser, we're losing two.

34:52.351 --> 34:53.569
That's all good,
don't you worry about it.

34:53.613 --> 34:55.441
Dropping like flies.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.312
He weighs so much, it's crazy.

34:57.356 --> 34:59.227
What are these?

34:59.271 --> 35:00.663
I know, right?
Macaroons.

35:00.707 --> 35:02.622
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven...

35:02.665 --> 35:04.754
well, I'm laughing because we're
only supposed to serve five.

35:11.370 --> 35:12.458
This is the bridge deck.

35:14.677 --> 35:15.983
My what?

35:18.072 --> 35:19.291
- That's it, perfect, thank you.
- Marvelous.

35:19.334 --> 35:20.901
Oh, my God!

35:20.944 --> 35:22.859
Wow, thank you.

35:22.903 --> 35:24.383
Oh, my God.

35:26.428 --> 35:27.908
Oh, my God.

35:34.828 --> 35:36.656
- Thank you, good night.
- Macaroon.

35:36.699 --> 35:38.048
What is this, by the way?

35:38.092 --> 35:39.528
Let's see, this is what,
charter three?

35:39.572 --> 35:41.356
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're halfway through.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.792
We've only been doing
this for two weeks,

35:42.836 --> 35:44.490
and there's a month to go.

35:44.533 --> 35:46.013
It's been going well
though, hasn't it?

35:46.056 --> 35:47.014
I think the whole
team's getting along well,

35:47.057 --> 35:48.015
or at least I hope so.

35:48.058 --> 35:49.756
Someone's gotta pop.

35:49.799 --> 35:50.757
Someone's gonna pop
at some point.

35:54.674 --> 35:56.415
Hi, I just wanted
to check in on you

35:56.458 --> 35:58.330
and see if
everything's going okay.

36:00.767 --> 36:03.378
I'm gonna cast
some suspicions on...

36:03.422 --> 36:04.553
- Jess.
- Yep.

36:04.597 --> 36:06.381
Yeah.

36:06.425 --> 36:07.426
When do you have to get your
stitches taken out, do you know?

36:08.601 --> 36:10.603
My grandparents
definitely played

36:10.646 --> 36:12.996
a secondary parental role
in my life,

36:13.040 --> 36:14.476
and so I just get concerned.

36:14.520 --> 36:15.782
I love them so much.

36:17.914 --> 36:19.960
That's it, I just wanted to
call quickly and check on you.

36:20.003 --> 36:22.441
You never know how much longer
you have with them.

36:22.484 --> 36:23.833
All right, love you.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.879
<i>Love you too, sweetie.
Bye.</i>

36:26.880 --> 36:28.882
She's like the weather.

36:28.925 --> 36:30.797
- She's very up and down.
- It's very up and down.

36:30.840 --> 36:31.928
It's sun for a short while, and
then it's thunder and lightning.

36:31.972 --> 36:33.495
Yeah, definitely a possibility.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.499
Coming up...

36:37.543 --> 36:38.979
- What was that?
- We lost a couple of cushions.

36:39.022 --> 36:40.372
Oh, you lost the big one.

36:40.415 --> 36:41.938
Of course we did.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.766
I'm just so ----ing frustrated
with getting yelled at.

36:43.810 --> 36:46.465
I want everything secured,
I want things covered.

36:46.508 --> 36:48.423
I don't want another
----ing thing

36:48.467 --> 36:49.816
falling off this boat, copy?

36:52.906 --> 36:55.038
Thank you so much
for joining us.

36:55.082 --> 36:56.823
- Oh...
- You probably wanna get to bed.

36:56.866 --> 36:58.390
Thank you for having me,
I really enjoyed it.

36:58.433 --> 36:59.869
It was our pleasure.

37:02.829 --> 37:04.570
Get a good night's sleep.

37:04.613 --> 37:07.790
Will you have breakfast, lunch,
and dinner with us tomorrow?

37:07.834 --> 37:10.053
Yes, you'll have dinner with us
for Ronnie's birthday tomorrow.

37:10.097 --> 37:11.620
Oh, that's right.

37:11.664 --> 37:12.882
- Oh, my God, it's amazing.
- The big 75.

37:12.926 --> 37:14.449
- It'll be my pleasure.
- Captain.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.799
Jodi, do you know how to
get back to your room?

37:16.843 --> 37:19.715
I sorta do.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.674
Am I following
you to your... oh.

37:21.717 --> 37:23.110
No, your room's down there.

37:23.153 --> 37:24.503
Are you going...
mine's down there?

37:24.546 --> 37:25.591
Okay.

37:27.810 --> 37:28.942
Where are you going?

37:28.985 --> 37:30.813
Wow, you got those double doors?

37:30.857 --> 37:32.989
I'm going to my room.
Alone.

37:33.033 --> 37:34.208
Have a good night.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.862
Thanks, you have
a good night too.

37:35.905 --> 37:36.906
You bet. Bye-bye.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.081
She was gonna follow me in here.

37:39.126 --> 37:40.649
Love that guy.

37:40.693 --> 37:41.911
Laugh it up, funny boy.

37:44.131 --> 37:45.611
What time you want me up?

37:45.654 --> 37:46.699
Eight hours from whenever
you go to bed.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.657
- Good night.
- Night.

37:48.701 --> 37:49.789
Night-night.

37:49.832 --> 37:51.138
Ugh.

37:55.621 --> 37:57.492
Oh, I'm so excited.

37:57.536 --> 37:58.711
Ow, my toe.

37:58.754 --> 37:59.973
- Sleep well.
- See you in the morning.

38:00.016 --> 38:01.409
I'll see you in the morning.

38:19.253 --> 38:20.428
Ow.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.085
The wind is relentless.

38:25.128 --> 38:26.086
Strap in.

38:26.129 --> 38:27.522
Here it comes.

38:30.525 --> 38:34.137
Oh, buddy, look
at those high socks.

38:34.181 --> 38:35.530
It's a good look for you.

38:35.574 --> 38:37.184
Oh, they're so tight.

38:37.227 --> 38:38.707
Isn't that what every man likes?

38:38.751 --> 38:41.971
- Oh, God.
- Jesus Christ.

38:46.541 --> 38:47.847
I do have almond milk.

38:47.890 --> 38:50.153
Todd the bod's
a little sexy beast.

38:50.197 --> 38:51.633
He's a little schnack.

38:51.677 --> 38:52.721
How did you sleep,
how was everything?

38:52.765 --> 38:54.767
- It was good.
- Meow.

38:56.029 --> 38:57.465
I'm really not into
that buff look.

38:57.509 --> 38:59.859
I like short, fat, and funny.

38:59.902 --> 39:01.469
Is there bacon in it?

39:02.775 --> 39:04.080
Give it a shot,
see what it's like.

39:04.124 --> 39:05.821
What are we up to, just,
like wiping down?

39:05.865 --> 39:06.909
Huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:06.953 --> 39:08.215
With the winds and stuff...

39:15.918 --> 39:16.919
- Oh, they go flying?
- Yes.

39:20.096 --> 39:22.229
It's, like, gusting.
Yeah, it needs to come in.

39:22.272 --> 39:24.144
We'll put it on the breakfast
table down here, then.

39:24.187 --> 39:25.972
<i>Eddie, Eddie, Lee.</i>

39:26.015 --> 39:28.627
Let's get primed, I wanna get
outta here sometime today.

39:28.670 --> 39:30.585
Copy that.

39:30.629 --> 39:33.022
So, we're taking this all back
downstairs to the main salon.

39:33.066 --> 39:34.589
To the table?

39:34.633 --> 39:35.808
All right,
let's get this closed up.

39:35.851 --> 39:37.157
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Get fenders in.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.158
I would do one of
those on every setting.

39:38.201 --> 39:40.160
Holy ----ing wind, dude.

39:40.203 --> 39:41.335
We're ready to sit for
breakfast, if you'd like.

39:41.379 --> 39:42.771
Great, great.

39:42.815 --> 39:44.251
- Do you wanna haul the anchor?
- Yes.

39:47.994 --> 39:50.953
So, Chef Rachel has prepared
an avocado toast on

39:50.997 --> 39:52.825
a hash brown cake
with a poached egg,

39:52.868 --> 39:56.002
and some mÃ©lange microgreens,

39:56.045 --> 39:59.005
as well as a chocolate chip
pancake special,

39:59.048 --> 40:00.659
with whipped cream.

40:00.702 --> 40:01.747
Oh!

40:01.790 --> 40:03.139
That sounds like my favorite...

40:03.183 --> 40:05.011
Ever?

40:05.054 --> 40:06.839
That... yes.

40:06.882 --> 40:08.101
Jake, get us outta here.

40:08.144 --> 40:09.363
Copy.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.278
- Is that short?
- Medium stay.

40:12.366 --> 40:13.541
Watch that wind.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.195
Two orders of oatmilk,

40:15.238 --> 40:17.545
and two orders of egg whites,
scrambled, no cheese...

40:17.589 --> 40:19.068
just clean egg whites.

40:20.592 --> 40:22.071
Anchor home, anchor home.

40:22.115 --> 40:23.725
<i>Copy that.</i>

40:26.859 --> 40:27.816
Anchor secured.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.035
Copy that.

40:29.078 --> 40:30.819
- Good job.
- Look at that.

40:30.863 --> 40:31.820
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

40:31.864 --> 40:32.908
That is a good one.

40:35.955 --> 40:37.739
- What was that?
-----ing wind.

40:37.783 --> 40:39.088
Oh, hell, no.

40:39.132 --> 40:40.133
It's cushions,
cushions, cushions.

40:40.176 --> 40:42.004
<i>Jon, Jon, Jon, Wes.</i>

40:42.048 --> 40:44.137
<i>Hey, we lost a couple cushions
as we just left anchorage.</i>

40:44.180 --> 40:45.878
Oh, we lost the big one.

40:45.921 --> 40:46.966
- Yeah.
- Yes.

40:49.272 --> 40:51.797
Sh--, I don't like
these pink ones.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.059
Don't tell me, I'm gonna
have to go back

40:53.102 --> 40:54.713
and get the ----ing cushions.

40:54.756 --> 40:56.236
That's going to upset me.

40:56.279 --> 40:57.280
Jon, Jon, Eddie.

41:02.242 --> 41:04.157
That's a common-sense thing.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.898
I'm not the
sharpest knife in the drawer,

41:05.941 --> 41:07.595
and I can figure it out.

41:07.639 --> 41:10.250
Wind's blowing... make sure
the cushions are secure.

41:10.293 --> 41:12.861
These guys could
up a two-car funeral.

41:12.905 --> 41:15.124
Should have been tight
as a Goddamn drum.

41:15.168 --> 41:16.256
Is that Jon right there?

41:16.299 --> 41:17.779
Yeah.

41:17.823 --> 41:19.607
Jon, Wes, do you have
a visual on them?

41:20.913 --> 41:22.654
Just unbelievable.

41:22.697 --> 41:25.091
The deck team needs more time
to get everything secured.

41:25.134 --> 41:27.093
They had plenty of time.

41:27.136 --> 41:29.008
They were standing up here for
15 minutes pulling the anchor.

41:29.051 --> 41:31.097
That's plenty of time to secure.

41:31.140 --> 41:33.012
I'm about to ----ing pop.

41:33.055 --> 41:35.057
Deckhands' first responsibility
is take care of the exterior,

41:35.101 --> 41:37.669
and now I'm getting reamed
out by Captain Lee.

41:37.712 --> 41:40.889
I'm really ----ing serious...
no more ups.

41:40.933 --> 41:42.978
I can't believe
I'm chasing ----ing cushions.

41:46.329 --> 41:47.766
He sees them.

41:47.809 --> 41:49.724
Jon, do you have them?

41:49.768 --> 41:51.030
Copy that, I'm gonna break off.

41:51.073 --> 41:52.640
The hammer needs to drop,

41:52.684 --> 41:54.076
and it's up to Eddie
to make it happen.

41:54.120 --> 41:56.252
Okay, guys, laz.

41:56.296 --> 41:57.950
If he doesn't drop it on them,

41:57.993 --> 42:00.343
he knows Goddamn well
I'm gonna drop it on him.

42:00.387 --> 42:03.172
I'm just so ----ing frustrated
with getting yelled at.

42:03.216 --> 42:05.261
I want everything secured,
I want things covered.

42:05.305 --> 42:07.133
I don't want
another ----ing thing

42:07.176 --> 42:08.874
falling off this boat, copy?

42:08.917 --> 42:10.832
That's ----ing bullsh--.

42:11.833 --> 42:13.052
Next on "Below Deck"...

42:13.095 --> 42:15.184
The wind here is
too fucking strong.

42:15.228 --> 42:17.665
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

42:17.709 --> 42:19.449
Goddamn it.

42:19.493 --> 42:23.236
Thirty-five years, I've never
seen wind with such intensity.

42:23.279 --> 42:26.413
It's Mother Nature
giving your ass a wake-up call.

42:26.456 --> 42:27.980
I'm gonna take 'em
into the ring,

42:28.023 --> 42:29.155
and I'm gonna
break 'em over my knee!

42:29.198 --> 42:30.983
Oh, yeah, brother!

42:31.026 --> 42:33.246
I guess this is what being
a first officer is all about.

42:33.289 --> 42:35.422
What a luxurious
promotion this is.

42:41.341 --> 42:42.385
How are you?

42:44.126 --> 42:46.172
The 'stache looks prettier
and prettier every day.

42:46.215 --> 42:47.477
Don't put the front down.

42:47.521 --> 42:49.392
- No.
- Put the front down it.

42:52.482 --> 42:54.963
Jake!
Jake!

42:55.007 --> 42:56.922
Oh, my God, they're
gonna tonight.

42:56.965 --> 42:59.098
I'm straight,
I'm just sexually comfortable.

42:59.141 --> 43:01.056
Like, I can do, like...

43:01.100 --> 43:04.843
- Ah!
- Yes!
