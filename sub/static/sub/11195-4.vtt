WEBVTT

00:10.219 --> 00:14.681
(PA) Offworld activation.
Repeat, we have an offworld activation.

00:17.309 --> 00:19.853
We're receiving Bra'tac's IDC, sir.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.980
Bra'tac?

00:22.105 --> 00:25.192
Open the iris.
Have Teal'c come to the gate room.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.549 --> 00:51.468
- I mean you no harm.
- Bra'tac.

00:52.678 --> 00:55.055
You've... done something with your hair.

00:55.973 --> 00:59.560
- Identify yourself.
- I am Shan'auc of the Red Hills.

01:00.352 --> 01:04.355
Master Bra'tac opened the Chaapa-ai,
but was unable to accompany me.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.693
Why's that?

01:07.818 --> 01:12.197
There is much unrest.
He took great risk in sending me here.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.372
Shan'auc.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.750
- Friend of yours?
- Indeed.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.802
Tal matte, Teal'c.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.473
Tal matte.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.690
(clears throat)

01:48.066 --> 01:51.403
Teal'c, how about
a little introduction of some sort?

01:51.486 --> 01:53.530
There is no need.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.456
Bra'tac has told me much of the Tauri.

02:02.539 --> 02:06.043
You are O'Neill... Teal'c's apprentice.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.588
Yeah... Apprentice?

02:09.670 --> 02:12.382
Also a warrior of great skill and cunning.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.384
Apprentice...

02:15.802 --> 02:20.516
Hammond of Texas.
A great and strong leader among humans.

02:24.311 --> 02:28.941
- What can we do for you?
- Take me to the Tok'ra immediately.

02:30.442 --> 02:34.196
I have information
that could destroy the Goa'uld.

03:51.023 --> 03:54.026
I have found a way
to communicate with my symbiote.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.738
Is that possible?

03:58.405 --> 04:00.449
It is not.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.243
That is what
we were trained to believe, Teal'c.

04:03.327 --> 04:06.830
The Goa'uld have no wish
for the Jaffa to influence their young.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.667
- That makes sense.
- How was this communion achieved?

04:11.001 --> 04:14.171
Within a deep state of kelno'reem.

04:14.254 --> 04:18.382
We know that the symbiote is completely
isolated from the Jaffa who carries it.

04:18.466 --> 04:23.263
- How can there be communication?
- The symbiote acts like an internal organ.

04:23.347 --> 04:28.393
They exchange hormones and electrical
impulses, but on an unconscious level.

04:28.477 --> 04:31.980
- It's a function of their immune system.
- It has taken years,...

04:32.105 --> 04:35.776
..but I have raised that primal
communication to the conscious level.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.237
Oh. OK, assuming that you, um...

04:40.322 --> 04:44.868
- What do you talk about?
- I convinced it that the Goa'uld are evil.

04:44.952 --> 04:48.872
That its own desires
for power and domination are wrong.

04:49.540 --> 04:53.794
It is willing to join the Tok'ra
and reveal all Goa'uld secrets to them.

04:53.877 --> 04:57.798
Um, I know I'm just
the apprentice at this table, but...

04:57.881 --> 05:01.802
Why then not instruct this symbiote
to deliver these secrets directly?

05:01.927 --> 05:05.264
- Exactly.
- We do not communicate in words.

05:05.389 --> 05:09.309
It is more feelings, images, memories.

05:10.143 --> 05:14.690
It'll only be capable of communicating
its knowledge once it takes a host.

05:14.773 --> 05:20.237
And since it believes that the Goa'uld
are evil, it will only take a willing host.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.698
It is most urgent.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.951
Your symbiote is ready
to take a host even now.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.662
It has already passed its time.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.290
You have my word
that it will harm no one.

05:31.415 --> 05:35.419
- I have convinced it to wait.
- Once a Goa'uld larva leaves the body,...

05:35.502 --> 05:38.130
..the Jaffa's immune system
stops functioning.

05:38.213 --> 05:42.217
- You're putting yourself at great risk.
- I believe that risk is worth taking.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.845
If you will take me
to the Tok'ra immediately.

05:44.928 --> 05:48.182
We can't do that. I'm sorry.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.936
You do not believe I speak the truth.

05:53.061 --> 05:56.148
- No, it's not that we don't believe you...
- We do not.

05:56.231 --> 06:00.777
- What you say cannot be proven.
- I think what Teal'c's trying to say is...

06:00.903 --> 06:04.406
I have said precisely
what I intended, O'Neill.

06:07.534 --> 06:11.997
OK, I guess what I'm trying to say is...
we'd like to believe you, we really...

06:12.080 --> 06:14.791
You have my word.

06:20.255 --> 06:25.052
But that is not enough. Then the secrets
of the Goa'uld will die with me!

06:25.177 --> 06:27.971
Shan'auc, please understand...

06:30.057 --> 06:33.060
I do understand, General Hammond.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.813
Bra'tac was wrong
about the wisdom of the Tauri.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.524
Shan'auc.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.737
Shan'auc!

06:53.664 --> 06:56.750
- (Hammond) Airmen!
- Do not!

06:58.961 --> 07:01.338
(Shan'auc) Taluk, mak kal'ma.

07:01.463 --> 07:05.634
Shal tai... Shal tai... Shal tai.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.140
Dr Fraiser, you may now approach.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.815
(Fraiser) We need to get her
to the infirmary.

07:27.364 --> 07:31.994
She wasn't exaggerating.
The symbiote is fully adult.

07:32.119 --> 07:36.039
- Yeah. Saw that.
- Her immune system is breaking down?

07:36.373 --> 07:39.626
Yes. I'm not sure how much longer
the symbiote will remain...

07:39.751 --> 07:42.754
..before it has no choice
but to seek out a new host.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.049
That is its primal, instinctual behaviour.

07:46.133 --> 07:50.053
- I may have to recommend quarantine.
- Well, if you think so.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.516
Absolutely, sir.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.769
No.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.027
I gave you a sedative.
You should be asleep.

08:05.777 --> 08:08.780
Kal'ma has neutralised the sedative.

08:08.864 --> 08:12.451
- Kal'ma?
- It means "child".

08:14.745 --> 08:17.498
The demon you carry within you
is no child.

08:17.581 --> 08:20.542
Do I not carry it within me
as I would my own?

08:20.626 --> 08:24.296
Have I not taught it right from wrong
as any mother would?

08:24.379 --> 08:26.840
You have closed your mind, Teal'c.

08:28.217 --> 08:30.427
I expected more.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.019
May we speak privately?

08:40.102 --> 08:44.316
My symbiote has assured me
that this will not happen again.

08:44.399 --> 08:48.654
Oh, well, if the snake says so,
then... who are we?

08:48.737 --> 08:51.198
(Fraiser) I'll be right outside.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.542
The others I can understand.

09:01.667 --> 09:05.796
But you've known me since before I went
to the temple. How can you doubt me?

09:05.963 --> 09:09.550
- This is my life's work.
- A life lived in worship of the Goa'uld.

09:09.675 --> 09:14.221
No. I believe now as you do
that they are false gods.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.432
Words from one who became
a priestess at the temple.

09:17.516 --> 09:21.186
One day, as I meditated in the temple
with the others,...

09:21.270 --> 09:24.356
..l heard the thoughts of my symbiote.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.817
Dreams that were not my own.

09:28.026 --> 09:31.363
I reached out to them with my mind
and I heard it answer.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.908
Not in words,...

09:34.992 --> 09:37.452
..but in grotesque images.

09:37.536 --> 09:41.790
And pain. I realised then
that the being I carried was no god.

09:41.874 --> 09:45.210
A powerful mind, yes.
But not that of a god.

09:47.462 --> 09:50.174
I dedicated my life that day...

09:50.257 --> 09:52.718
..to showing it the way of peace.

09:55.137 --> 09:58.557
It understands now
that the Goa'uld are an abomination.

10:01.685 --> 10:04.938
Can you not see what it is that I offer?

10:05.230 --> 10:10.277
Bra'tac is wise. I do not know why
he would have sent you here unless...

10:10.360 --> 10:12.321
He believes, Teal'c.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.910
How can I make you believe too?

10:23.916 --> 10:26.293
There is a way.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.385
How is she?

10:35.469 --> 10:40.516
Uh, Fraiser says she has
maybe a... couple of days, tops.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.894
- Find anything?
- No.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.855
But Teal'c knows more on the subject
than I ever will.

10:46.939 --> 10:49.900
He sure doesn't believe her.

10:49.983 --> 10:53.654
Yeah, well, there may be
more than meets the eye here.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.699
I'm thinkin' they got history.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.826
- History?
- Oh, yeah.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.498
- She's a temple priestess.
- So?

11:05.791 --> 11:08.794
So they don't do a lot of dating.

11:08.919 --> 11:14.049
Maybe not. But there was
some serious sparkage when she arrived.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.845
OK. The question is...
what if she's telling the truth?

11:18.470 --> 11:23.183
So what? She can't tell the Tok'ra any
more than they already know, can she?

11:23.267 --> 11:27.896
- Actually, sir, she can. The Tok'ra...
- Consider themselves different. I know.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.649
But let's call a snake a snake, shall we?

11:30.732 --> 11:36.154
They are both parasitical and pass on
knowledge through genetic memory, yes.

11:36.238 --> 11:40.534
But the majority of the Tok'ra left the
Goa'uld gene pool over 2,000 years ago.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.871
Yeah, they probably learned
a thing or two in that time.

11:43.996 --> 11:48.959
Which makes Shan'auc's symbiote very
valuable, sir. To us and to the Tok'ra.

11:49.084 --> 11:53.297
If Teal'c doesn't buy it, I don't buy it,
and there's no way to prove it, so...

11:53.380 --> 11:55.424
O'Neill.

11:56.842 --> 11:59.219
Master Teal'c.

12:00.012 --> 12:03.348
- I am in need of your assistance.
- I'm here to serve.

12:04.725 --> 12:07.644
Daniel Jackson, Major Carter.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.939
I am in need of your assistance also.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.370
In the deepest levels of kelno'reem,...

12:25.454 --> 12:28.790
..the heart beats
in extremely long intervals.

12:28.874 --> 12:34.546
It is even possible to meditate so deeply
that one may stop the heart altogether.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.715
The practice is forbidden.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.384
Wouldn't your symbiote
try to start it up again?

12:39.510 --> 12:43.680
That is correct. According to Shan'auc,...

12:43.764 --> 12:48.727
..it is only at this time communion
between Jaffa and symbiote is possible.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.146
Like a... near-death experience.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.941
That is correct.

12:54.024 --> 12:57.027
- Is it dangerous?
- Jack, he's stopping his heart.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.197
I mean for us.

13:01.949 --> 13:05.285
I am unsure of what will occur
if and when...

13:05.369 --> 13:08.163
..communion with my symbiote
is achieved.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.667
It may be necessary to restrain me.

13:13.252 --> 13:16.421
Well... Knock yourself out.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.576
I believe I saw a vision of my father.

13:45.951 --> 13:48.495
It's working?

13:50.956 --> 13:53.417
I will begin again.

14:45.302 --> 14:47.429
Medical emergency, Teal'c's quarters.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.558
That will not be necessary, Major Carter.

14:51.642 --> 14:54.311
Belay that last order and stand by.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.898
Get him up.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.360
What happened?

15:02.402 --> 15:04.947
I received a vision from my symbiote.

15:05.239 --> 15:07.699
It was a memory it chose to share.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.286
Its hatred for me is great.

15:13.580 --> 15:17.167
Then it is possible.
Shan'auc is telling the truth.

15:20.546 --> 15:21.797
Yes.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.639
Yes.

15:36.311 --> 15:39.022
(distorted) The great queen, Egeria.

15:39.106 --> 15:42.067
She broke from the Goa'uld
over 2,000 years ago.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.778
Her offspring became the Tok'ra.

15:46.572 --> 15:49.741
- Egeria, Roman goddess of fountains.
- Fountains?

15:50.742 --> 15:53.453
Also childbirth.

15:53.537 --> 15:57.040
- How do those two go together?
- It doesn't matter. Um...

15:57.166 --> 16:00.669
She was also adviser to Numa Pompilius,
a legendary ruler.

16:00.794 --> 16:04.047
Correct, Dr Jackson.
Egeria came to the Tauri...

16:04.173 --> 16:08.010
..to stop the Goa'uld from taking humans
through the Stargate as slaves.

16:08.135 --> 16:12.347
Ra found her and killed her, but not
before she spawned our movement.

16:12.431 --> 16:14.474
- Literally.
- Yes.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.143
Thanks for the image.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.896
Then the original number of Tok'ra
is all you have?

16:18.979 --> 16:23.942
Very few Goa'uld came over to our side,
but none in the past few hundred years.

16:24.067 --> 16:28.864
Our numbers have diminished as
symbiotes unable to find new hosts died.

16:28.989 --> 16:32.743
That is why
Shan'auc's offer is so provocative.

16:32.826 --> 16:37.706
Until the symbiote is blended with the
host, we cannot be sure of the outcome.

16:37.831 --> 16:42.294
But if what she claims is correct,
we could one day increase our numbers.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.088
So you've decided to accept her offer?

16:45.214 --> 16:48.800
I will make the proposal to the council
with my recommendation.

16:48.884 --> 16:52.137
- How long will that take?
- It will not be an easy decision.

16:52.221 --> 16:55.098
There are great risks involved.

16:55.182 --> 17:00.479
- She doesn't have a lot of time.
- Shan'auc's symbiote is fully mature.

17:00.562 --> 17:04.233
It must take a host within a day.
Two at most.

17:04.316 --> 17:06.777
Then I will leave immediately.

17:11.031 --> 17:15.117
- I would make a personal request.
- (undistorted) What is it, Teal'c?

17:18.747 --> 17:21.834
Shan'auc came to this world
expecting not to survive.

17:21.959 --> 17:25.045
She needs a symbiote to replace
that which she now carries.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.589
By the time you return it may be too late.

17:27.714 --> 17:31.134
There are no Jaffa within the Tok'ra ranks.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.557
I do not wish her to die.

17:37.558 --> 17:40.102
I cannot promise, Teal'c.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.604
But we will try.

18:09.298 --> 18:12.050
The Tok'ra council
is considering your offer.

18:12.134 --> 18:15.137
My symbiote is eager to meet them.

18:15.220 --> 18:18.098
I hope they can reach
their decision in time.

18:22.853 --> 18:25.147
The pain grows worse.

18:25.981 --> 18:28.025
Yes.

18:30.694 --> 18:35.324
- For what reason did you wait so long?
- I was afraid you would not believe.

18:36.825 --> 18:40.746
Since word came to the temple
that you betrayed Apophis,...

18:40.871 --> 18:43.582
..l have thought of you every day.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.752
- As a shol'va.
- No, Teal'c.

18:47.711 --> 18:51.215
Because of you,
my doubts became certainties.

18:51.298 --> 18:55.677
When we were children, you were
always the strongest, the bravest.

18:55.761 --> 18:58.430
That you would be first prime
was never doubted.

18:58.514 --> 19:02.434
But then you did
what no Jaffa before you had ever done.

19:02.518 --> 19:05.604
You challenged the gods themselves
and won.

19:09.399 --> 19:14.029
Among many on Chulak you are
as revered as the gods once were.

19:14.738 --> 19:17.616
- And yet you walk away.
- My place is here.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.078
Is it?

19:21.203 --> 19:24.873
Bra'tac cannot be expected
to bear the burden alone.

19:24.998 --> 19:28.168
It was you
who first began walking this path.

19:28.293 --> 19:31.880
Do not abandon those
who have followed you this far.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.925
I have abandoned no one.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.270
When I die,...

19:46.395 --> 19:50.858
..and you are the only one capable of
teaching others what I have learned,...

19:50.983 --> 19:53.443
- ..what then?
- Do not concern yourself with me.

19:53.569 --> 19:56.280
I have all but given my life
for a cause you inspired!

19:56.363 --> 19:58.407
Tal shak kree!

20:03.620 --> 20:06.707
I will advise you when there is news.

20:06.832 --> 20:10.961
When you touched the mind of
your symbiote, what did it show you?

20:16.508 --> 20:18.802
The murder of my father.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.471
A most slow and painful death.

20:22.139 --> 20:24.600
At the hand of Cronus.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.310
Yes.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.770
It wanted you to know fear.

20:29.813 --> 20:31.857
Yes.

20:31.982 --> 20:34.359
You are stronger than that.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.196
Why does it appear to have succeeded?

20:45.496 --> 20:47.956
My first communion was the same.

20:48.790 --> 20:51.793
It took many days before I tried again.

20:52.836 --> 20:57.382
But one day the images it chose
to share with me began to change.

20:57.466 --> 20:59.760
They became sorrowful,...

20:59.843 --> 21:03.347
..as though my kal'ma
were awakening to its own shame.

21:04.389 --> 21:07.726
In time the images became beautiful,...

21:07.809 --> 21:10.270
..even caring.

21:10.354 --> 21:13.440
- If that is all...
- There is more.

21:22.950 --> 21:25.410
I fear losing you a second time.

21:27.621 --> 21:29.665
No.

21:33.877 --> 21:35.921
Never again.

22:04.908 --> 22:08.078
- Teal'c.
- Kel sha, Daniel Jackson.

22:08.203 --> 22:10.581
Morning. How's, uh... Shan'auc?

22:12.374 --> 22:17.337
The pain of carrying a symbiote past its
time is extreme. Shan'auc bears it well.

22:17.462 --> 22:20.007
Listen, I was just headed off to breakfast...

22:20.132 --> 22:23.886
- I am not.
- Uh, could you stop... walking?

22:31.977 --> 22:34.688
Is everything all right?

22:34.771 --> 22:36.273
Yes.

22:36.356 --> 22:41.236
You see, cos I noticed that you've been
preoccupied lately, obviously, and, uh...

22:41.361 --> 22:47.201
Well, I just thought if you wanted to talk...
that I was here to... talk.

22:48.702 --> 22:50.746
Daniel Jackson...

22:51.330 --> 22:54.666
If all Jaffa can be taught
to commune with their symbiotes,...

22:54.750 --> 22:58.670
..then the days of the Goa'uld
are truly numbered.

22:58.754 --> 23:03.634
- And Shan'auc can teach them.
- If she survives, I intend to be at her side.

23:04.885 --> 23:08.222
If she does not,
I will not allow her sacrifice to be in vain.

23:08.305 --> 23:11.016
Teal'c! We just got word from the Tok'ra.

23:11.099 --> 23:15.562
- They've accepted Shan'auc's offer.
- When may we depart?

23:15.646 --> 23:19.149
Now. Colonel O'Neill's
waiting for us in the gear-up room.

23:44.424 --> 23:48.095
(distorted) Shan'auc of the Red Hills,
welcome to Vorash.

23:49.388 --> 23:51.849
It is a great honour to meet the Tok'ra.

23:51.974 --> 23:54.935
They're all right, if you like the type.

23:55.602 --> 23:58.939
It is an equal pleasure to see you,
Colonel O'Neill.

24:00.023 --> 24:02.401
Your father asked
that I shake your hand...

24:02.484 --> 24:06.154
..and give Colonel O'Neill
a big kiss from him.

24:07.072 --> 24:09.449
Uh, that might have been
the other way around.

24:09.575 --> 24:11.535
Maybe. Is Freya in there?

24:13.787 --> 24:16.331
- (undistorted) Of course, Colonel.
- Then it is true.

24:16.582 --> 24:19.751
Host and symbiote
share the body equally.

24:19.835 --> 24:22.921
And we are both pleased
to tell you good news.

24:23.005 --> 24:27.384
As Teal'c requested, one of our operatives
retrieved a newly-spawned symbiote...

24:27.467 --> 24:29.928
..to replace that which Shan'auc offers.

24:30.053 --> 24:33.056
- You have done this for me?
- Not only for you.

24:33.182 --> 24:37.102
If you truly have turned your symbiote
to the Tok'ra cause,...

24:37.186 --> 24:40.439
..then your life is more valuable
than any of ours.

24:41.106 --> 24:44.276
Kal'ma, it will not be long now.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.946
She has carried her symbiote
far past its time.

24:48.030 --> 24:50.491
Then come. This way.

24:59.833 --> 25:03.003
We were able to find a host
both willing and eager.

25:04.463 --> 25:06.507
Eager too, huh?

25:08.926 --> 25:12.179
This is the volunteer host,
Hebron of Paraval.

25:12.763 --> 25:15.557
Jack O'Neill, Earth.

25:15.641 --> 25:18.018
Um... Forgive my bluntness here,...

25:18.143 --> 25:21.730
..but... do you have any idea
what you're getting into?

25:23.357 --> 25:26.693
- We have told him everything.
- Yeah. Well, I've noticed...

25:26.818 --> 25:31.615
..the Tok'ra have a tendency
to leave out minor details sometimes.

25:32.741 --> 25:35.410
You do know this thing's
gonna be in your head?

25:35.494 --> 25:37.621
You only get your body part-time?

25:37.746 --> 25:42.042
My own people were enslaved
by the Goa'uld a generation ago.

25:42.125 --> 25:44.837
I understand
what benefit may come of this.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.505
All right.

25:46.588 --> 25:49.258
This is Shan'auc.

25:53.846 --> 25:57.432
What can you tell me of the one with
whom I will spend the rest of my days?

25:57.558 --> 26:00.394
That he wishes
to forswear his birthright,...

26:00.477 --> 26:04.398
..and desires to stop the Goa'uld
from causing any more harm.

26:04.523 --> 26:09.069
- Then we will have that in common.
- You will share much, much more...

26:12.030 --> 26:14.575
I have waited too long.

26:17.452 --> 26:20.873
- It must be done now.
- We are not ready for the transference.

26:20.998 --> 26:23.125
It can wait no longer.

26:27.963 --> 26:30.507
Teal'c! It cannot wait!

26:32.426 --> 26:34.469
I am ready.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.600
Take me.

26:54.364 --> 26:57.951
Colonel O'Neill, lower your weapon.
The transference is complete.

26:58.035 --> 27:00.412
Transference? That's what you call that?

27:00.496 --> 27:02.539
Shan'auc.

27:10.714 --> 27:14.551
(distorted) There was no more time.
Shan'auc's life was in grave danger.

27:14.676 --> 27:19.806
I had to act. Have you a Prim'ta
ready for implantation?

27:19.932 --> 27:22.809
- Yes.
- Do it now. She is near death.

27:37.574 --> 27:39.701
I am Tanith.

27:45.833 --> 27:50.295
It is my honour to pledge
my allegiance to the Tok'ra.

28:00.013 --> 28:02.057
How is she?

28:03.559 --> 28:08.438
Shan'auc is still very weak. The symbiote
we were able to retrieve was quite young.

28:08.689 --> 28:11.567
- But she's gonna be OK?
- We believe so.

28:18.699 --> 28:21.368
Hello, Hebron.

28:22.202 --> 28:27.249
- (distorted) He is here, Colonel O'Neill.
- Actually we'd like to hear that from him.

28:28.125 --> 28:30.169
Of course.

28:35.257 --> 28:37.551
(undistorted) It is... true.

28:37.634 --> 28:41.680
It is a strange feeling,
but... I am very much here.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.807
How do we know that?

28:44.683 --> 28:48.604
Tanith wants you to know we will
submit to any test you wish to perform...

28:48.687 --> 28:51.231
..to assure you
that I am speaking freely as host.

28:51.356 --> 28:56.570
Rest assured, Tanith is pure of heart.
Shan'auc was indeed a great teacher.

28:57.821 --> 29:03.243
Good. Then maybe Tanith wouldn't mind
sharing some of that Goa'uld knowledge.

29:07.998 --> 29:11.251
- Of course.
- When the time is appropriate.

29:11.335 --> 29:14.129
- I think now is appropriate.
- We disagree.

29:14.213 --> 29:15.714
Ah, here we go.

29:15.797 --> 29:19.134
Tanith has asked to join the Tok'ra,
not the SGC.

29:19.259 --> 29:21.720
- Are you kidding me?
- We will gladly share...

29:21.845 --> 29:26.141
..what knowledge we feel is useful to
the furthering of our alliance with Earth.

29:26.266 --> 29:29.102
- Does my father go along with this?
- I'm sure he will.

29:29.186 --> 29:31.396
How do I hang up with Anise
and talk to Freya?

29:31.522 --> 29:33.899
- Why?
- I like Freya!

29:34.024 --> 29:37.110
- She and I are in complete agreement.
- How do I know that?

29:37.402 --> 29:41.323
- I have told you.
- And I'm supposed to trust you?

29:41.406 --> 29:46.119
You know, this whole "talking to two
people in one body thing" really sucks.

29:50.249 --> 29:52.709
Shan'auc.

29:55.754 --> 30:00.050
It is good to finally see the face
of she who taught me so much.

30:02.010 --> 30:04.221
Oh!

30:04.304 --> 30:07.057
To speak with you in words...

30:07.683 --> 30:10.310
It is something I never dreamed of.

30:10.394 --> 30:13.021
There will be time for words.

30:13.105 --> 30:16.859
You must stay a while.
We have so much to talk about.

30:16.942 --> 30:19.069
- I will.
- Teal'c?

30:20.654 --> 30:23.740
I sense that she is still very weak.

30:23.824 --> 30:27.161
Her new symbiote is extremely young
for the task of healing her.

30:27.244 --> 30:31.790
I hope that your indecision did not
put her at more risk than necessary.

30:41.717 --> 30:44.803
I guess we should just
mosey on back to Earth...

30:44.928 --> 30:48.682
..and tell General Hammond
how the Tok'ra boned us again.

30:51.393 --> 30:53.270
(Freya) Colonel!

30:56.190 --> 31:00.360
- Please take no offence.
- Hey, we're gettin' used to it.

31:08.076 --> 31:11.497
Teal'c, you can come and visit Shan'auc
after we've debriefed.

31:11.622 --> 31:15.209
That is, if it's all right
with our good friends and allies.

31:15.292 --> 31:18.378
- He is welcome, of course.
- Swell.

31:19.838 --> 31:21.882
Let's go.

31:26.011 --> 31:28.055
O'Neill.

31:29.431 --> 31:33.477
- I would like to stay a moment.
- We'll wait at the gate.

31:49.576 --> 31:53.497
I must inform the Tauri
of my intention to leave their service.

31:55.123 --> 31:57.084
I will await your return.

31:57.751 --> 32:00.838
We will return to Chulak...

32:00.963 --> 32:04.550
..and tell every Jaffa in every village
of your achievement.

32:04.675 --> 32:07.219
Together.

32:07.845 --> 32:10.931
- Tal matte, Shan'auc.
- Tal matte, my love.

32:34.288 --> 32:36.832
Have I disturbed you?

32:36.957 --> 32:40.043
(distorted) The hour is late.
You should be resting.

32:42.296 --> 32:44.965
I could not wait to speak with you.

32:51.972 --> 32:54.016
Yes...

32:58.770 --> 33:02.691
We must speak... of your audacity.

33:04.109 --> 33:06.153
I do not understand.

33:06.278 --> 33:11.325
How dare a priestess touch the mind
of one who would be her god?

33:12.576 --> 33:14.620
You despise the Goa'uld.

33:14.745 --> 33:17.122
I am the Goa'uld.

33:17.956 --> 33:20.751
But I showed you the...

33:21.210 --> 33:24.213
You showed me the means
to destroy the Tok'ra.

33:26.381 --> 33:28.675
Now accept your reward.

33:37.893 --> 33:41.647
It is with much sadness
that I must take my leave of the SGC.

33:47.152 --> 33:49.196
Are you certain, Teal'c?

33:50.239 --> 33:52.449
He means leave of absence, sir.

33:52.741 --> 33:55.619
No, I have said what I mean, O'Neill.

33:56.453 --> 33:59.790
I intend to live the remainder
of my life on Chulak.

34:00.874 --> 34:02.334
What on earth for?

34:02.417 --> 34:05.838
Do you not recognise the greatness
of Shan'auc's achievement?

34:05.963 --> 34:09.800
If the whole idea was to get
the secrets of the Goa'uld to the Tok'ra...

34:09.925 --> 34:12.302
And us, oh, by the way.

34:12.427 --> 34:15.389
Then it's done. Mission accomplished.

34:15.472 --> 34:21.143
I mean, even if you could train Jaffa
to communicate with their symbiotes,...

34:21.270 --> 34:23.938
..the Tok'ra have a hard enough time
finding hosts.

34:24.022 --> 34:26.817
The point is... you belong here.

34:26.900 --> 34:29.987
I belong where I am needed most, O'Neill.

34:30.112 --> 34:33.532
And that is on Chulak, at Shan'auc's side.

34:33.657 --> 34:37.411
- (Stargate alarm)
- Offworld activation.

34:45.252 --> 34:48.045
Incoming travellers, sir. It's the Tok'ra.

34:48.964 --> 34:52.551
- Here to share squat with us, no doubt.
- Open the iris.

35:28.962 --> 35:32.883
(undistorted) Teal'c, it is
with great sorrow that I return.

35:34.635 --> 35:39.014
- Shan'auc.
- We found the body outside her chamber.

35:39.223 --> 35:42.059
The symbiote she carried is also dead.

35:43.352 --> 35:46.188
If we had found a more mature larva...

35:47.022 --> 35:49.233
She appeared well.

35:49.358 --> 35:54.071
Shan'auc's death is simply
the unfortunate result of waiting too long.

36:17.010 --> 36:19.054
Shan'auc...

36:21.056 --> 36:24.643
Tal mek. Creon te shree.

36:29.481 --> 36:31.525
Tal ma.

36:32.901 --> 36:35.362
"Our love does not end in death."

36:52.796 --> 36:57.759
I wanted Teal'c to have the body for
whatever ritual he may wish to perform.

37:39.343 --> 37:40.928
Agh!

37:42.179 --> 37:44.973
Teal'c? (bangs on door)

37:51.396 --> 37:53.690
Teal'c!

37:53.815 --> 37:57.402
- What's up?
- Shan'auc was murdered.

38:15.212 --> 38:18.632
We have not yet obtained
information of any value from Tanith.

38:18.715 --> 38:21.093
Your return is premature.

38:21.176 --> 38:23.846
You folks should... invest in some doors.

38:23.929 --> 38:27.516
- We have no secrets from each other.
- Beg to differ with you.

38:27.641 --> 38:33.397
The Goa'uld Shan'auc carried was
not truly convinced to become a Tok'ra.

38:33.522 --> 38:36.608
I believe the Goa'uld
use this opportunity to spy among you.

38:36.692 --> 38:38.986
What evidence have you for this?

38:39.069 --> 38:43.532
The murder of Shan'auc. The System
Lord Cronus murdered my father...

38:43.615 --> 38:45.909
..by crushing his symbiote
in such a way...

38:45.993 --> 38:50.164
..that it allowed the symbiote's blood
to mix with that of my father.

38:50.247 --> 38:53.500
- A method slow and immensely painful.
- How do you know this?

38:53.625 --> 38:56.628
In communion with my own symbiote.

38:56.712 --> 38:59.173
It is a vision my symbiote chose to share.

38:59.298 --> 39:02.968
- Why?
- To show Goa'uld hatred and superiority.

39:03.051 --> 39:05.179
Still, if that is your proof...

39:05.262 --> 39:09.725
We found Goa'uld blood in Shan'auc's
bloodstream and on her hands.

39:09.850 --> 39:14.313
- Confirming my vision.
- And so you have come to exact revenge.

39:15.147 --> 39:17.774
- I have.
- I'm sorry.

39:17.858 --> 39:19.985
We cannot allow you.

39:25.157 --> 39:27.284
Stop him!

39:45.052 --> 39:48.388
Kree ton, Tok'ra! Togar toku!

39:49.056 --> 39:50.682
Kree!

39:51.099 --> 39:53.769
Teal'c! We can get the Goa'uld
out of the host.

39:53.852 --> 39:58.023
No. He'll be infinitely
more valuable to us if we do not.

40:04.404 --> 40:06.448
You knew.

40:08.450 --> 40:11.870
(undistorted) We suspected.
But only after her death.

40:12.538 --> 40:15.541
Teal'c, we truly had hoped
Shan'auc had succeeded.

40:15.666 --> 40:18.919
But if we allow Tanith
to believe he has deceived us,...

40:19.044 --> 40:21.922
..we will be able to use that
against the Goa'uld.

40:22.005 --> 40:23.966
- Disinformation.
- Yes.

40:24.091 --> 40:28.637
If we control what he sees and hears,
the Goa'uld will not know our intentions.

40:28.720 --> 40:31.890
We will be able to use
that advantage for months.

40:32.015 --> 40:34.685
When Tanith no longer
serves a useful purpose,...

40:34.768 --> 40:39.147
..we will extract what
Goa'uld secrets we can in other ways.

40:42.693 --> 40:45.154
What about the host?

40:47.114 --> 40:49.158
(distorted) He knew well the risks.

40:49.283 --> 40:53.412
When we have learned all that we can,
we will try to remove the Goa'uld.

40:53.495 --> 40:56.582
We are fighting a war
for our very existence.

40:56.665 --> 40:59.501
I make no apologies for the means.

41:01.503 --> 41:03.547
Release him.

41:50.636 --> 41:52.679
(distorted) Hello, Teal'c.

41:54.014 --> 41:58.268
You must feel the pain
of Shan'auc's death as deeply as I do.

42:00.145 --> 42:02.689
It is a terrible loss to both of us.

42:04.650 --> 42:07.110
It has been difficult.

42:12.491 --> 42:15.494
Why have you come to see me?

42:15.577 --> 42:17.955
To look upon you...

42:18.080 --> 42:21.917
..and know Shan'auc's sacrifice
will not be in vain.

42:22.876 --> 42:25.546
You have my promise.

42:28.715 --> 42:32.636
I hope one day
we will meet again, Teal'c,...

42:34.096 --> 42:38.392
..and together remember
she who meant so much to both of us.

42:38.725 --> 42:41.019
We will meet again.

42:46.817 --> 42:49.361
You have my promise.
