[narrator]<i> A cold-blooded</i>

00:18.218 --> 00:21.687
Four and a half minutes, and
that was it. They rubbed him out.

- [police siren wailing] - [narrator]<i>
A mystery that must be solved.</i>

00:24.657 --> 00:26.158
[Vicki Chittick]<i> You're</i>
<i>already behind the eight-ball</i>

00:26.259 --> 00:28.894
because you have no idea
who the person is.

00:28.995 --> 00:31.230
[narrator]<i> Until a trail</i>
<i>of surveillance footage...</i>

00:31.331 --> 00:33.766
[Jack Nasworthy]<i> It is very
grainy, it's not the best quality</i>

00:33.867 --> 00:35.167
but right now it's all I got.

00:35.268 --> 00:36.268
[Vicki]<i> Holding your breath.</i>

00:37.637 --> 00:39.171
<i>Waiting for something.</i>

00:39.272 --> 00:41.907
[narrator]<i> reveals</i>
<i>the shocking truth.</i>

00:42.375 --> 00:43.242
They're there.

00:43.343 --> 00:45.744
That was a huge break
in the case.

01:09.969 --> 01:13.338
[narrator]<i> Fifty four-year-old Larry
Howse and his friend, David Strong</i>

01:13.440 --> 01:15.607
<i>are returning
from a crabbing trip.</i>

01:16.843 --> 01:18.544
[David Strong]<i> We met</i>
<i>at our neighborhood pub.</i>

01:18.645 --> 01:22.047
I had just really moved
into downtown Tacoma.

01:22.148 --> 01:24.616
<i>From that day on,
we became friends.</i>

01:24.717 --> 01:28.754
<i>Larry loved boating,
he loved being on the water.</i>

01:28.855 --> 01:30.756
- We got everything over there?
- [man] Think so.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.724
[David]<i> The last time</i>
<i>we were together,</i>

01:32.826 --> 01:36.228
<i>we had went out crabbing,
and he had said to me...</i>

01:36.329 --> 01:39.498
- Wanna just hang out and watch the sunset for a bit?
- [David] Yeah.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.104
And then, out of the blue,
he just said...

01:45.205 --> 01:48.040
And thanks for being my
friend. I really appreciate it.

01:48.141 --> 01:49.875
- You know I'm always there for you, brother.
- Thanks, man.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.847
[David]<i> And that sunset</i>
<i>on that day,</i>

01:54.948 --> 01:56.582
it's etched in my mind.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.124
[narrator]<i> It's Labor</i>
<i>Day weekend,</i>

02:05.225 --> 02:08.594
<i>and Larry is celebrating
with his family over lunch.</i>

02:08.695 --> 02:13.332
He was going to spend the day
with Maggie, his ex-wife, and his sons.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.870
[Dave Howse]<i> Larry was a great
dad. He did projects with 'em,</i>

02:17.971 --> 02:19.271
<i>he gave 'em advice.</i>

02:19.372 --> 02:23.709
They all went camping, and
fishing, and boating together.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.411
<i>You talk to them, they all
think they had a great dad.</i>

02:26.513 --> 02:28.413
Honestly, though,
I'm so proud of you guys.

02:28.515 --> 02:30.115
You guys have done
so great in school.

02:30.216 --> 02:34.753
Larry was a gay man
who came out later in life,

02:34.854 --> 02:36.588
after marriage and children.

02:36.689 --> 02:40.859
And that's a struggle for folks. I
happen to be an openly gay pastor,

02:40.960 --> 02:43.762
and I think that's one
of the reasons we connected.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.597
Thanks very much.

02:45.698 --> 02:50.602
His sons obviously loved their father
very much and came to support him.

02:50.703 --> 02:53.505
Okay, boys, I'll pick you up nice
and early tomorrow morning, okay?

02:53.606 --> 02:55.641
So, be ready, okay? Love you.

02:55.742 --> 02:57.543
[David]<i> We were gonna</i>
<i>meet up that evening.</i>

02:57.644 --> 02:59.611
I was expecting to hear
from him but I didn't.

[Jack Nasworthy]<i> Officers
responded immediately to the call.</i>

03:23.236 --> 03:26.071
<i>The Sky Terrace apartments,
it's a nice complex.</i>

03:26.172 --> 03:27.706
<i>It's in the north end of Tacoma.</i>

03:27.807 --> 03:30.576
The whole area is fairly nice,
well-taken care of.

03:30.677 --> 03:32.477
<i>It's a low-crime area.</i>

03:32.579 --> 03:34.046
[police siren wailing]

03:36.950 --> 03:40.752
[narrator]<i> Before police can get
there, the crime scene is discovered.</i>

03:43.423 --> 03:48.360
[Jack]<i> A resident of the Sky
Terrace was gonna take a walk.</i>

03:48.461 --> 03:52.631
<i>She saw the victim laying in
the middle of the parking lot.</i>

03:52.732 --> 03:55.934
So she went back upstairs
and contacted a neighbor,

03:56.035 --> 03:59.238
<i>and asked him to come down
with her to check on him.</i>

04:01.307 --> 04:02.674
The neighbor was an army medic,

04:02.775 --> 04:05.344
<i>and realized that he was
significantly injured,</i>

04:06.412 --> 04:09.114
and called 911.

04:09.215 --> 04:13.652
Police officers responded to the scene
and discovered that he had been shot,

04:14.454 --> 04:15.854
<i>and was deceased.</i>

04:17.957 --> 04:20.292
Hi. Did you get briefed?

04:20.393 --> 04:24.229
I was assigned to assist
Detective Nasworthy.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.164
<i>So we went in
to do the walk-through.</i>

04:31.704 --> 04:36.375
I had a deceased male, about 50
years old, shot in a parking garage.

04:36.476 --> 04:38.043
Nobody saw anything.

04:40.980 --> 04:44.316
[Vicki]<i> He was on his back,</i>
<i>with his arms outstretched.</i>

04:44.417 --> 04:46.551
<i>His pants were down,
around his ankles.</i>

04:46.653 --> 04:48.654
That was after a medical aide
had moved him.

04:52.825 --> 04:54.693
Nearby where
the victim was located,

04:56.896 --> 04:59.498
<i>there was clothing that
had been folded up,</i>

04:59.599 --> 05:02.534
<i>a jacket, and a pair
of shoes set aside.</i>

05:04.537 --> 05:06.305
<i>It looked like it had
been neatly folded</i>

05:06.406 --> 05:09.408
with care, which tells me
it's probably the victim,

05:11.444 --> 05:13.612
which is unusual.

05:13.713 --> 05:15.580
[Vicki]<i> You're already behind</i>
<i>the eight-ball because</i>

05:15.682 --> 05:18.250
you have no idea
who the person is.

05:18.351 --> 05:19.885
[camera shutter clicking]

05:19.986 --> 05:24.589
[Jack]<i> So we go through the
pockets and attempt to ID him.</i>

05:24.691 --> 05:29.127
We didn't see any wallet, we didn't see
any cell phone, we didn't see any car keys.

05:29.228 --> 05:31.630
[Jack]<i> So we considered</i>
<i>it could be a robbery.</i>

05:32.999 --> 05:37.336
But the Sky Terrace condominiums
were a secure parking garage.

05:37.437 --> 05:42.207
You could not get in without having a key,
or being let in by one of the residents.

05:44.744 --> 05:47.245
[Vicki]<i> You have a couple of
scenarios going through your head.</i>

05:47.347 --> 05:51.550
Is this somebody who targeted this person
specifically? Is it someone that he knew?

05:53.786 --> 05:55.387
[Jack]<i> I had to consider</i>
<i>the possibility that somebody</i>

05:55.488 --> 05:57.522
<i>within the building
was responsible for this.</i>

06:01.461 --> 06:04.930
We had detectives doing a canvas
of the entire apartment building.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.399
And it was during those canvases

06:07.500 --> 06:11.336
when we contacted the first
witness who had called 911.

06:13.339 --> 06:14.973
Just a few questions.

06:15.074 --> 06:18.009
[Jack]<i> A woman who was
visiting one of her family members,</i>

06:18.111 --> 06:20.746
she had been out on the
balcony, smoking a cigarette.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.648
<i>She heard two male
voices talking.</i>

06:23.750 --> 06:27.219
And one had said something to the fact
the effect of, "Do you want to go get him?"

06:27.320 --> 06:30.155
Another voice answers
something like, "Sure."

06:30.256 --> 06:34.893
Shortly after that, she heard a
conversation and then the shots being fired.

06:34.994 --> 06:36.895
All right, thank you very much,
ma'am. It's been a big help.

06:39.198 --> 06:42.634
We began to suspect that
this was probably a robbery

06:42.735 --> 06:45.637
<i>because his pants pockets
had been turned inside out.</i>

06:45.738 --> 06:47.606
<i>And so, believing
the possibility</i>

06:47.707 --> 06:50.842
<i>that the suspects had
rummaged through his pants,</i>

06:50.943 --> 06:53.979
<i>we submitted his pants
for DNA analysis.</i>

06:58.584 --> 07:00.852
<i>We still did not know
who this person was,</i>

07:00.953 --> 07:04.656
<i>so we located a name and
a phone number of the manager.</i>

07:04.757 --> 07:06.258
I'm trying to identify the man.

07:06.359 --> 07:10.128
They told me that they might
be able to recognize him.

07:12.465 --> 07:15.734
<i>We don't normally
show people our victims.</i>

07:15.835 --> 07:18.403
<i>But because we really needed
to know who this person was,</i>

07:18.504 --> 07:23.208
<i>it was agreed that we would take a picture
of the subjects face on the cell phone.</i>

07:23.309 --> 07:24.843
[cell phone camera
shutter clicking]

07:27.079 --> 07:28.547
<i>They believed it was Mr. Howse,</i>

07:28.648 --> 07:32.784
and was able to tell us that
Mr. Howse drove a black BMW,

07:32.885 --> 07:33.952
which was parked in the garage.

07:37.457 --> 07:41.693
[Jack]<i> So you had a tentative ID, this was
Lawrence Howse, and the apartment number.</i>

07:47.133 --> 07:49.601
[Vicki]<i> We entered the
apartment to do a security check,</i>

07:49.702 --> 07:51.403
<i>to see if Mr. Howse was there.</i>

07:54.774 --> 07:56.842
<i>Once we got inside,
there was nobody in there.</i>

07:56.943 --> 07:59.344
[Jack]<i> The apartment was
very clean, very well-kept.</i>

08:01.914 --> 08:05.684
<i>That was when I saw
the family photograph.</i>

08:05.785 --> 08:09.387
<i>And I immediately recognized
him as the deceased.</i>

08:12.158 --> 08:14.192
[inaudible police radio chatter]

08:15.261 --> 08:17.729
[Jack]<i> As we're surveying</i>
<i>the scene,</i>

08:17.830 --> 08:20.065
we did see one security camera.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.935
[Vicki]<i> It was like,</i>
<i>you know, jackpot.</i>

08:24.036 --> 08:26.738
That's the only thing
we had at that point.

08:26.839 --> 08:32.077
The victim was in the opposite side,
so not where the camera was located.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.413
<i>However, the camera did cover
the entrance to the parking garage.</i>

08:37.683 --> 08:42.621
<i>We went down to the store room
where the hard drive was being kept.</i>

08:42.722 --> 08:44.890
Cue it to 9:45
where the shots were.

08:46.659 --> 08:52.831
Based on where the camera was located,
I was hoping that it would have captured

08:52.932 --> 08:55.734
either the suspects or the
victim, coming and going.

08:55.835 --> 08:59.204
<i>I hoped to get a good picture
of the suspects</i>

08:59.305 --> 09:00.939
and have something to go with.

09:09.815 --> 09:11.683
[Jack] Okay, play on.

09:28.601 --> 09:29.801
Freeze there.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.139
Too dark to see who's in it.

09:35.107 --> 09:36.207
Zoom in.

09:38.544 --> 09:42.180
I saw the victim's black BMW
enter the parking lot.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.384
BMW hub caps, so that's it.
Okay, play on.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.002
Okay, rewind.

10:04.103 --> 10:08.006
You see two people walking on the
sidewalk and walking into the garage.

10:10.943 --> 10:15.680
<i>Two younger black males, the first
one is wearing a light-colored sweatshirt.</i>

10:15.781 --> 10:20.852
<i>The second male, he's
wearing a plaid shirt and jeans.</i>

10:20.953 --> 10:22.253
Pause.

10:23.222 --> 10:24.723
Zoom in on the belt.

10:24.824 --> 10:27.459
<i>And what stands out
in this video,</i>

10:27.560 --> 10:30.195
<i>is he has a belt
that's actually dangling,</i>

10:30.296 --> 10:33.298
almost all the way down between
his legs, which is kind of unusual.

10:33.399 --> 10:34.366
Play on.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.677
Okay, rewind. Let's have
another look at that.

10:45.778 --> 10:49.881
<i>The suspect in the white
sweatshirt, he walks in first,</i>

10:49.982 --> 10:52.717
<i>and he's seen gesturing to
where the vehicle had parked,</i>

10:52.818 --> 10:55.553
<i>and then he turns and talks
to the second male.</i>

10:59.158 --> 11:02.827
<i>I believe that's the conversation
of, "Do you want to get him?"</i>

11:02.928 --> 11:06.765
So that's what the witness that
had originally called 911 heard.

11:09.135 --> 11:13.638
The second suspect in the
plaid shirt walks past him.

11:13.739 --> 11:17.709
<i>You could tell he's walking with a purpose
to where the victim was later found.</i>

11:19.378 --> 11:20.679
He does have kind of
an unusual gait,

11:20.780 --> 11:22.247
that's something else
that kind of stood out.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.060
<i>I know at that point that
a human life is being taken.</i>

11:36.962 --> 11:38.663
So it can be kind of shocking.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.943
Clearly, it was
a very quick encounter.

11:53.846 --> 11:56.781
I'm sure, Mr. Howse, it was probably
the longest four minutes of his life.

11:58.417 --> 11:59.984
[Jack]<i> If they had</i>
<i>parked a car nearby,</i>

12:00.086 --> 12:03.221
then they would have left in the
same direction that they came in.

12:03.322 --> 12:06.391
They did not do that. They
left in the opposite direction.

12:06.492 --> 12:11.162
<i>That and the fact that the suspects
both approached on foot and left on foot</i>

12:11.263 --> 12:16.101
meant I was pretty comfortable that
they lived in the area of downtown Tacoma.

12:17.803 --> 12:21.172
<i>What's unfortunate about
the footage is it is very grainy,</i>

12:21.273 --> 12:24.709
<i>it is low-light footage,
it's not the best quality.</i>

12:24.810 --> 12:26.044
But right now it's all I got.

12:36.188 --> 12:38.456
[David]<i> I got up</i>
<i>the next morning.</i>

12:38.557 --> 12:41.226
<i>I usually got a text message
or something from Larry.</i>

12:41.327 --> 12:45.663
"Good morning. "Have you had
your coffee?" was our daily text.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.567
<i>And there was nothing but
I didn't think anything of it.</i>

12:49.668 --> 12:53.438
I was walking
to our church service,

12:53.539 --> 12:59.377
and I received a phone call from
a friend of mine, a state trooper.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.413
<i>And he said, "David,
I need to tell you something."</i>

13:02.515 --> 13:05.116
<i>And he said Larry
was murdered last night.</i>

13:08.888 --> 13:14.092
And I, uh, was just shocked.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.728
Just shocked.

13:16.829 --> 13:19.063
<i>Your mind races
about what happened.</i>

13:19.165 --> 13:22.801
<i>Why would anyone
do anything to him?</i>

13:25.871 --> 13:29.274
And, uh, I came home and I just,

13:31.076 --> 13:33.912
cried, most of the rest
of the day.

13:37.616 --> 13:39.851
[Dave]<i> It's kind of a blur.</i>

13:39.952 --> 13:44.689
Got a call and [voice shaking]
"Larry's been killed."

13:48.627 --> 13:52.564
<i>I was told that he was
murdered and I didn't believe it.</i>

13:52.698 --> 13:55.800
It's forced upon you, to try
to make some sense of it,

13:55.901 --> 13:57.735
and it just doesn't happen.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.306
<i>And still, I wonder,
you know, "Why?"</i>

14:03.242 --> 14:05.777
[David]<i> I called his sons.</i>

14:05.878 --> 14:10.548
The first thing the boy said to me
is, "David, we're sorry for your loss."

14:17.923 --> 14:21.192
And I thought, "Wow,
how you all lost your father,

14:22.261 --> 14:25.096
and you're sorry for my loss."

14:25.197 --> 14:31.102
I don't have words but that just shows you
the kind of men that he raised them to be.

14:38.077 --> 14:39.878
[Jack]<i> I decide that it's best</i>

14:39.979 --> 14:43.848
<i>if I go to my department's patrol
office at the start of their shift,</i>

14:43.949 --> 14:45.350
and I show them the video.

14:50.489 --> 14:53.291
<i>I think seeing the full
video, you can see it better,</i>

14:53.392 --> 14:55.526
<i>you can even get a better idea
of what their clothing looks like.</i>

14:56.729 --> 15:00.198
<i>The suspect in the plaid shirt
kind of had a unique walk,</i>

15:00.299 --> 15:04.168
<i>and I wanted the officers to
have an opportunity to see that.</i>

15:04.870 --> 15:06.371
<i>And I say...</i>

15:06.472 --> 15:08.606
If you come across anyone in the
downtown area that looks similar to this,

15:08.707 --> 15:10.208
please let me know.

15:12.077 --> 15:15.713
At this point I think this was a
crime of opportunity, a random attack.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.652
So, tell me
whereabouts you saw...

15:20.753 --> 15:23.988
[Vicki]<i> I went up to interview
another couple that had called in.</i>

15:24.089 --> 15:27.492
They said that they saw the
subjects running, northbound.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.862
<i>And from the view of their
apartment, they showed us.</i>

15:32.498 --> 15:35.633
<i>That's when we realized that
the subjects were on Stadium Way.</i>

15:38.504 --> 15:40.605
<i>We walked the entire distance,</i>

15:41.640 --> 15:43.841
looking for any
type of evidence,

15:43.943 --> 15:47.879
<i>like Mr. Howse's watch, or wallet, or
anything that might have been dropped.</i>

15:49.548 --> 15:51.683
<i>Sadly, we did not find anything.</i>

15:51.784 --> 15:55.853
And then we started pulling
video from the area businesses

15:55.955 --> 15:57.889
<i>to see if we could locate
anything that would give us</i>

15:57.990 --> 16:00.224
<i>a clearer picture
of the suspect's face.</i>

16:04.596 --> 16:09.334
[narrator]<i> Detective Nasworthy asks Larry's
friend David, along with Larry's family,</i>

16:09.435 --> 16:11.469
<i>to come to the
police department.</i>

16:15.007 --> 16:17.809
[David]<i> He wanted us</i>
<i>to look at the video,</i>

16:17.910 --> 16:21.412
<i>to see if we recognized
the guys.</i>

16:21.513 --> 16:25.083
<i>I just remember
seeing Larry come in,</i>

16:27.619 --> 16:29.520
<i>and then seeing
those guys rush in.</i>

16:29.621 --> 16:35.426
I'm just thinking, "This is my
friend's last moment on Earth."

16:41.033 --> 16:42.333
[Jack] You recognize anybody?

16:50.109 --> 16:54.412
To know that someone who wouldn't
have done anything to harm anyone,

16:54.513 --> 17:00.218
whose life was just carelessly
taken from them over a wallet.

17:09.995 --> 17:14.665
[narrator]<i> The team scrutinize</i>
<i>hours of local area CCTV.</i>

17:14.767 --> 17:17.301
[Vicki]<i> Jack and myself</i>
<i>and all the other detectives,</i>

17:17.436 --> 17:20.638
everybody watched over
and over and over again,

17:20.739 --> 17:22.473
<i>looking for any little thing.</i>

17:25.511 --> 17:28.913
The more you look and the less you
find, the more frustrating it becomes.

17:30.949 --> 17:32.350
[Jack]<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i>we found nothing.</i>

17:33.585 --> 17:35.420
<i>That was very disappointing.
It was a lot of work.</i>

17:35.521 --> 17:37.522
A lot of detectives
really worked on that.

17:38.757 --> 17:40.091
[telephone ringing]

17:41.126 --> 17:42.260
Nasworthy.

17:42.361 --> 17:44.896
<i>We had an anonymous
tip called in,</i>

17:44.997 --> 17:47.365
and provided a name of a person.

17:47.466 --> 17:48.833
That's great.

17:48.934 --> 17:51.536
<i>It was a very specific tip.</i>

17:51.637 --> 17:53.971
It said that this person actually
bragged about the shooting.

18:04.049 --> 18:05.516
<i>When we receive
an anonymous tip,</i>

18:05.617 --> 18:10.121
<i>we want to follow up and
get something that's verifiable.</i>

18:10.222 --> 18:14.725
[narrator]<i> Acting on the tip, Detective
Nasworthy runs the name David Elwood</i>

18:14.827 --> 18:17.061
<i>through the police database.</i>

18:17.162 --> 18:19.864
I don't want to go and just
grab somebody off the street

18:19.965 --> 18:23.901
<i>because without having anything
more, I would have a really difficult time</i>

18:24.002 --> 18:26.938
if he said, "No, I wasn't
there," and have to let him go.

18:31.510 --> 18:34.445
I did consider the possibility
that this was a false lead.

18:34.546 --> 18:38.082
<i>The fact that the tipster
did not want any follow-up,</i>

18:38.183 --> 18:39.784
<i>that can be an area of concern.</i>

18:39.885 --> 18:43.221
- Anything?
- Enough to maybe send us down a blind alley.

18:43.322 --> 18:47.525
Once I was able to completely verify
this person had nothing to do with it,

18:47.626 --> 18:50.695
I strongly believe that either
one of the suspects,

18:50.796 --> 18:52.797
or somebody very close
to one of the suspects

18:52.898 --> 18:55.399
called in that tip
to throw off the police.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.401
[Vicki] Well, we got the DNA
report back from the lab.

18:59.738 --> 19:03.541
[Jack] We submitted Larry
Howse's pants for DNA analysis

19:03.642 --> 19:06.144
to see if anyone's
DNA were on 'em.

19:09.114 --> 19:12.683
<i>When we found Mr. Howse, his
pockets had been turned inside out,</i>

19:12.784 --> 19:16.287
<i>and so I believe that the suspects
had rummaged through his pants.</i>

19:18.090 --> 19:22.894
<i>But the only DNA that was recovered was
associated with the victim, Larry Howse.</i>

19:25.864 --> 19:27.165
[narrator]<i> Days go by</i>

19:29.168 --> 19:31.435
<i>but there are no new leads.</i>

19:31.537 --> 19:34.472
[Jack]<i> I put out the bulletin
of the picture of the suspects,</i>

19:34.573 --> 19:37.575
<i>hoping that one of our
officers would recognize him.</i>

19:41.213 --> 19:45.049
A couple of days later, we had
a very observant patrol officer

19:45.150 --> 19:48.085
who responded
to the Walgreens Pharmacy.

19:55.561 --> 19:59.096
<i>The store manager
said that two subjects,</i>

19:59.198 --> 20:02.700
one was described as a black
male wearing a blue plaid shirt,

20:02.801 --> 20:07.171
<i>had taken a bottle of vodka and
went back out without paying for it.</i>

20:10.275 --> 20:13.010
[Vicki]<i> Walgreens has video</i>
<i>surveillance cameras.</i>

20:13.111 --> 20:17.915
So that officer was able to
view the subject on the camera.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.753
He believed the suspect
was the same suspect

20:22.854 --> 20:25.790
involved in the homicide
of Larry Howse.

20:25.891 --> 20:29.927
This has the potential to be
a very key piece of evidence.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.634
[narrator]<i> The camera is near</i>
<i>the store entrance.</i>

20:46.478 --> 20:47.778
Play that again.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.284
Freeze it there.

20:53.385 --> 20:57.188
You see the subject and he's
wearing this blue plaid shirt

20:57.289 --> 21:01.993
that matched what we thought that
the suspect in the homicide was wearing.

21:03.829 --> 21:07.198
It was like, "Oh, my God.
This is great."

21:07.299 --> 21:09.267
- I think that's our guy there.
- Maybe.

21:10.469 --> 21:12.136
But it's a bad angle.

21:12.237 --> 21:15.206
<i>You really don't get
a good view of their face.</i>

21:15.307 --> 21:16.807
<i>It's just a side view.</i>

21:16.908 --> 21:19.510
So I was able to contact
Walgreens and say...

21:19.611 --> 21:21.512
Can you get me the
camera angles on everything?

21:21.613 --> 21:22.813
The entire incident?

21:22.914 --> 21:26.417
It was very frustrating
having to wait to get that video.

21:39.898 --> 21:42.166
[Dave]<i> David Strong</i>
<i>is Larry's pastor.</i>

21:42.267 --> 21:45.670
<i>Larry's funeral was at
the Methodist Church.</i>

21:45.771 --> 21:51.142
[David] He was a son,
a father, a husband.

21:51.243 --> 21:54.178
So many folks in our community
were in shock.

21:54.279 --> 21:57.348
[Dave]<i> There was a lot of
people there from all walks of life.</i>

21:57.449 --> 22:02.086
You don't realize, you know,
the effect he had on people.

22:02.187 --> 22:06.023
<i>It was very hard for me. 'Cause
you're trying to make sense of it.</i>

22:06.124 --> 22:10.961
You're trying to be supportive
to Larry's two kids.

22:11.063 --> 22:15.433
[David]<i> I felt a particular
protection for his sons.</i>

22:15.534 --> 22:18.302
And I remember
telling them that...

22:21.306 --> 22:23.808
Their dad was very proud of them

22:23.909 --> 22:26.377
and he loved them
very, very much.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.452
[narrator]<i> At the Walgreens,</i>

22:36.755 --> 22:39.457
<i>the new CCTV angles
are ready to view.</i>

22:50.202 --> 22:53.070
[Vicki]<i> The camera faces</i>
<i>right on those doors,</i>

22:53.171 --> 22:55.906
dead on, so you get
a great shot.

22:56.007 --> 22:58.743
[Jack]<i> I really was not expecting
it to be this good a quality.</i>

23:11.323 --> 23:12.790
That's him. Rewind.

23:16.928 --> 23:20.197
<i>And it shows the subject
coming in through the doors.</i>

23:20.298 --> 23:23.267
[Jack]<i> He's wearing a blue plaid
jacket. He had the same hair style</i>

23:23.368 --> 23:25.469
as the suspect
in the Sky Terrace homicide.

23:27.439 --> 23:29.140
Zoom in on the belt.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.041
<i>What stood out the most to me,</i>

23:31.143 --> 23:35.246
<i>he appeared to be wearing the same
belt dangling down underneath the shirt.</i>

23:35.881 --> 23:37.448
It's the same one.

23:37.549 --> 23:39.450
<i>He does have
kind of unusual gait,</i>

23:39.551 --> 23:42.153
so I was pretty convinced
this is my suspect.

23:45.524 --> 23:47.024
Stop there.

23:47.959 --> 23:49.126
Who's the other guy?

23:49.227 --> 23:50.861
Our next thing that
we had to do was like,

23:50.962 --> 23:52.396
"Who's the guy that
followed him in the store?"

23:53.465 --> 23:55.099
[Jack]<i> Behind the first suspect</i>

23:55.200 --> 23:58.002
<i>in the blue plaid shirt
was a second male.</i>

23:58.103 --> 24:00.070
<i>Who is wearing
a multicolored jacket.</i>

24:00.172 --> 24:04.975
We're like, "Is he the second
person in the homicide or not?"

24:05.076 --> 24:06.844
<i>Because he was not wearing
the same clothing.</i>

24:06.945 --> 24:10.281
[Jack]<i> I considered the possibility
it was our second suspect.</i>

24:13.285 --> 24:15.920
<i>But to me this person
looked older.</i>

24:16.021 --> 24:18.489
<i>I didn't think it was
the same person.</i>

24:18.590 --> 24:20.257
[narrator]<i> The man</i>
<i>in the green jacket</i>

24:20.358 --> 24:22.393
<i>is ruled out
of police inquiries.</i>

24:22.494 --> 24:24.128
What other angles do you have?

24:37.075 --> 24:38.142
They're there.

24:39.744 --> 24:41.946
[Jack]<i> Obviously,</i>
<i>those two were together</i>

24:42.047 --> 24:44.582
<i>because they walked together
to the alcohol.</i>

24:44.683 --> 24:47.384
And then the suspect
in the blue plaid shirt

24:47.452 --> 24:50.721
<i>selects the alcohol and they walk out
together and go in the same direction.</i>

24:55.393 --> 24:56.427
Go back to the entrance.

25:15.213 --> 25:17.448
I just remember I'm just
being, like, totally confident.

25:17.549 --> 25:19.750
Like I'm just gonna come
here and take this and leave.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.552
<i>It was like, "How bold."</i>

25:21.653 --> 25:22.953
Could we see
the outside cameras?

25:28.693 --> 25:31.028
When you see
the parking lot of Walgreens,

25:31.129 --> 25:32.162
you can see them walking away.

25:36.501 --> 25:38.769
<i>This was really the biggest
piece to the puzzle we had.</i>

25:38.870 --> 25:40.004
This was huge for us.

25:40.105 --> 25:42.373
Thank you. We got what we need.

25:42.474 --> 25:44.742
<i>Someone's going to be
able to recognize this</i>

25:44.843 --> 25:46.443
<i>because it was good video.</i>

25:46.545 --> 25:49.547
And so it was exciting. We had
something that we could really work with.

25:52.284 --> 25:55.052
[Jack]<i> I contacted video
forensics and I said, "Hey..."</i>

25:55.153 --> 25:57.254
Can you compare the person
in the Walgreens footage

25:57.355 --> 25:59.757
with the person
in the Sky Terrace homicide?

25:59.858 --> 26:01.525
And tell me
if you can make a match.

26:01.626 --> 26:04.028
You always are hoping
that they're gonna see

26:04.129 --> 26:06.597
the same thing that
you think you're seeing.

26:06.698 --> 26:09.900
<i>But you have to be realistic
that it may or may not be.</i>

26:10.001 --> 26:12.836
<i>So just kinda
holding your breath,</i>

26:12.938 --> 26:14.972
waiting for them to come back
with something.

26:22.547 --> 26:24.615
[Jack]<i> I wanted to release</i>
<i>these pictures to the public.</i>

26:24.716 --> 26:27.851
[Vicki]<i> We were putting all of
these crime stoppers' bulletins out</i>

26:27.953 --> 26:30.821
<i>at the Walgreens, too, when we were
canvassing all of the neighborhoods</i>

26:30.922 --> 26:33.891
knowing that if they're gonna frequent
these stores and they're walking on foot,

26:33.992 --> 26:36.393
<i>that someone in the area
probably knows who they are.</i>

26:38.029 --> 26:39.563
[phone ringing]

26:39.664 --> 26:43.167
A couple of days later I got a
phone call back from video forensics.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.002
Nasworthy.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.671
That phone call was a
huge piece of evidence for us.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.615
[Jack]<i> Video forensics</i>
<i>viewed the video.</i>

26:57.716 --> 27:03.454
He says he is 100% confident that the
person in the Walgreens security video

27:03.555 --> 27:05.789
is the same suspect
in the Sky Terrace homicide.

27:08.193 --> 27:12.262
I thought it was fantastic that this,
obviously, this proved to be a huge break.

27:13.298 --> 27:16.100
<i>He also explained
based on his experience</i>

27:16.201 --> 27:18.602
<i>in these types of cases,
robbery homicide,</i>

27:18.703 --> 27:21.538
<i>the person with the gun
is normally the first person</i>

27:21.640 --> 27:23.874
<i>to go forward to make contact
with the victim.</i>

27:26.878 --> 27:30.147
<i>You see the first suspect in the
white hoodie, he actually stops</i>

27:30.248 --> 27:33.951
<i>and lets the second suspect
approach first.</i>

27:34.052 --> 27:36.487
<i>And so the suspect
wearing the plaid shirt</i>

27:36.588 --> 27:38.822
<i>is probably the one
carrying the gun.</i>

27:40.725 --> 27:42.192
[phone ringing]

27:43.862 --> 27:47.131
A number of tips came in over
the week into Crime Stoppers

27:47.232 --> 27:49.667
<i>naming a man named Andrew Boyd.</i>

27:53.905 --> 27:56.440
Andrew Boyd was
an 18-year-old male.

27:56.541 --> 28:00.210
He lived at the halfway house for
juveniles called the Sylvester House.

28:01.279 --> 28:04.281
<i>Based on that I decided
to call the manager.</i>

28:06.017 --> 28:09.653
She admitted, "Yes, I saw the picture of
the Walgreens and that's Andrew Boyd."

28:11.790 --> 28:13.524
[Vicki]<i> The residents can</i>
<i>come and go as they want,</i>

28:13.625 --> 28:15.092
but they have to sign in and out

28:15.193 --> 28:16.427
when they leave
and when they come back.

28:17.962 --> 28:21.031
I asked the manager if she
could bring that log book with her,

28:21.132 --> 28:22.866
<i>and come in
for a full interview.</i>

28:23.635 --> 28:24.868
Thank you.

28:26.271 --> 28:28.305
We did see the date
of the homicide

28:28.406 --> 28:31.341
specifically states in there that
Andrew Boyd was not at home

28:31.443 --> 28:33.210
<i>when Larry Howse was killed.</i>

28:37.348 --> 28:39.149
Who does Andrew Boyd
hang out with?

28:39.250 --> 28:41.118
<i>She was not aware of anybody.</i>

28:41.219 --> 28:44.555
And she provided the names of
everybody else staying at the house.

28:44.656 --> 28:47.891
And none of them matched the
description of the second suspect.

28:47.992 --> 28:49.193
Thank you for your time.

28:52.130 --> 28:54.465
We had a tough decision to make.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.501
<i>To continue to wait to try to
identify the second suspect,</i>

28:57.602 --> 28:59.870
<i>or to simply go ahead
and arrest Andrew</i>

28:59.971 --> 29:02.439
and hope he would identify
the second suspect for us.

29:04.309 --> 29:07.644
<i>But to get real justice for
Larry Howse and his family</i>

29:07.746 --> 29:09.580
I wanted to get
both suspects in custody.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.619
<i>Almost exactly three weeks
to the date from the homicide,</i>

29:15.687 --> 29:17.821
<i>I got a phone call
from one of my partners.</i>

29:17.922 --> 29:19.356
- [cell phone rings]
- Nasworthy.

29:19.457 --> 29:23.060
She had just received a phone
call from a defense attorney.

29:24.529 --> 29:27.765
<i>Who says, "I have a client
that just came forward."</i>

29:29.400 --> 29:32.436
She has some information on
the Lawrence Howse homicide.

29:34.906 --> 29:37.341
- Hi, I'm Detective Jack Nasworthy.
- Hello.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.743
- Hi. Detective Vicki Chittick.
- Hi.

29:42.947 --> 29:46.850
Well, she was living with
another female in an apartment.

29:46.951 --> 29:50.621
[narrator] She also mentions
the name Jeremy Bennett

29:50.722 --> 29:54.158
She said that Jeremy Bennett
stayed there on and off.

29:54.259 --> 29:58.829
And so was Andrew Boyd because Jeremy
and Andrew spent a lot of time together.

30:00.865 --> 30:04.802
On the night of the homicide, it
was the night before her birthday,

30:04.903 --> 30:07.437
and so she specifically
remembers that day.

30:07.539 --> 30:11.241
<i>They came back to the house
separately. Jeremy came back first.</i>

30:11.342 --> 30:16.346
Jeremy Bennett comes in
approximately after 10:30

30:17.849 --> 30:22.152
kinda out of breath and starts to
take some items out of his pocket.

30:22.253 --> 30:24.822
[Jack]<i> He pulled out</i>
<i>a wallet, a watch,</i>

30:24.923 --> 30:26.924
and a set of BMW keys.

30:28.026 --> 30:32.429
And he kinda joked about,
"Anybody wanna drive a BMW?"

30:33.798 --> 30:35.899
[Jack]<i> Larry Howse had</i>
<i>had his wallet stolen,</i>

30:36.000 --> 30:37.901
<i>and his watch, and his car keys.</i>

30:38.002 --> 30:41.104
<i>This is the information we
never released to the public.</i>

30:41.206 --> 30:43.073
It convinced me that
she was telling me the truth.

30:43.174 --> 30:44.341
What happened to the wallet?

30:44.442 --> 30:47.044
Jeremy and his friend
Jheri Flood burned it.

30:47.145 --> 30:51.181
They were both standing near the
barbecue and she smelt burning plastic.

30:51.282 --> 30:53.116
And she asked
what was happening,

30:53.218 --> 30:55.385
and Jeremy said something
to the effect of,

30:55.486 --> 30:58.255
"We're taking care of
that stuff from that thing."

30:59.891 --> 31:03.260
<i>Two weeks later she saw
the Crime Stoppers' flyer.</i>

31:03.361 --> 31:07.164
I looked up and I saw
picture of Mr. Howse.

31:07.265 --> 31:08.732
How did you know it was him?

31:08.833 --> 31:11.034
Well, that was
the exact picture that I saw

31:11.135 --> 31:13.503
on the driver's license and
the wallet that Jeremy had.

31:16.574 --> 31:19.376
[narrator] <i>The detectives go
back to the police department</i>

31:19.477 --> 31:21.712
<i>and run the names
of Andrew Boyd,</i>

31:21.813 --> 31:24.815
<i>Jheri Flood and Jeremy Bennett
through the database.</i>

31:27.418 --> 31:28.886
[Jack]<i> I got photographs,</i>

31:30.822 --> 31:32.089
<i>and I asked...</i>

31:32.190 --> 31:33.891
Can you identify these men?

31:40.999 --> 31:42.165
She identified out all of them.

31:43.401 --> 31:46.403
[woman] That's Jheri Flood,
that's Jeremy Bennett,

31:47.171 --> 31:49.106
and that's Andrew.

31:49.207 --> 31:52.276
She was able to positively
identify Andrew Boyd

31:52.377 --> 31:54.711
as being one of the people
involved in the homicide.

31:54.812 --> 31:57.314
And that Jeremy Bennett
was the other person.

31:59.317 --> 32:01.885
That was a huge break
in the case.

32:09.527 --> 32:13.797
[narrator]<i> Detectives are now
confident that Boyd wearing the plaid shirt</i>

32:13.865 --> 32:15.766
<i>and Bennett in the white hoodie</i>

32:15.867 --> 32:17.968
<i>murdered Larry Howse.</i>

32:18.069 --> 32:19.836
That was just a great day

32:19.938 --> 32:21.939
because it put a lot of
the pieces in place.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.408
Got what we need.
Let's go make the arrest.

32:30.114 --> 32:32.015
<i>Early in the morning
we started surveillance</i>

32:32.116 --> 32:36.753
of all the known associated addresses
of Jeremy Bennett and Andrew Boyd.

32:39.190 --> 32:41.792
<i>Two uniformed officers
go to the Sylvester House</i>

32:41.893 --> 32:44.294
<i>and arrested Andrew Boyd
in his bedroom.</i>

32:46.364 --> 32:48.565
<i>His blue plaid shirt
was recovered there.</i>

32:51.302 --> 32:53.270
[Vicki]<i> The family</i>
<i>is expecting justice.</i>

32:53.371 --> 32:55.939
<i>You really wanna help the family,
and you wanna have the answers.</i>

32:56.040 --> 33:00.510
So, it was extremely relieving
to have somebody in custody.

33:02.213 --> 33:04.247
FBI's Violent Crime's task force

33:04.349 --> 33:07.818
<i>served the search warrant on
the residence of Jeremy Bennett.</i>

33:09.187 --> 33:11.388
<i>And Jeremy Bennett
was not located at home.</i>

33:14.392 --> 33:17.027
<i>Andrew Boyd was brought in
for questioning.</i>

33:17.128 --> 33:21.631
He was wearing the same belt that's
seen in both, the Sky Terrace homicide

33:21.733 --> 33:25.335
<i>and in the Walgreens' video
at the robbery.</i>

33:25.436 --> 33:28.705
<i>I said, "Andrew, you need to
tell me your side of the story."</i>

33:30.408 --> 33:32.809
<i>Andrew denied any involvement.</i>

33:34.746 --> 33:36.646
[narrator] <i>In Downtown Tacoma</i>

33:36.748 --> 33:40.584
<i>officers arrest another of
Boyd and Bennett's associates.</i>

33:40.685 --> 33:43.020
[Jack]<i> Jheri Flood was located</i>
<i>at his mother's place.</i>

33:43.121 --> 33:46.890
Jheri was the one that started
the fire in the barbecue grill.

33:46.991 --> 33:50.494
<i>He admitted to being the one that
put Larry Howse's wallet in there.</i>

33:53.064 --> 33:55.632
There was a different detective
who was interviewing Jheri Flood

33:55.700 --> 33:57.467
while I was interviewing
Andrew Boyd.

33:59.404 --> 34:02.339
<i>That detective told me
everything that Jheri had said.</i>

34:02.440 --> 34:05.275
Shortly after
Larry Howse' homicide

34:05.376 --> 34:07.844
he was having an argument
with Andrew Boyd.

34:07.945 --> 34:11.782
<i>And Andrew told him, "If you don't
watch it, I'm gonna kill you, too."</i>

34:11.883 --> 34:13.884
<i>And that was enough
to scare Jheri.</i>

34:13.985 --> 34:17.220
So I went back in,
I talked to Andrew Boyd again.

34:17.321 --> 34:20.023
<i>And I said, "Jheri Flood's
telling us everything.</i>

34:20.124 --> 34:23.593
And so, this is your one opportunity
to give me your side of the story."

34:25.930 --> 34:28.365
<i>I wasn't getting any real
responses from him.</i>

34:31.436 --> 34:33.637
<i>I had stilled pictures
from the Walgreens.</i>

34:38.176 --> 34:39.643
<i>He denied it was him.</i>

34:39.744 --> 34:42.479
Then I say, "Andrew, you're pretty
much wearing the same clothes.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.081
You've got the same belt on."

34:44.182 --> 34:46.216
<i>So he finally admitted
to being in Walgreens.</i>

34:47.218 --> 34:49.653
And so that was a huge step.

34:49.754 --> 34:53.390
<i>But I still needed Andrew to tell me
what happened at the Sky Terrace.</i>

34:53.491 --> 34:55.292
I needed an emotional response
from him.

34:57.628 --> 34:59.830
I said, "Andrew,
we have security video

34:59.931 --> 35:02.265
inside the Sky Terrace
parking garage.

35:02.366 --> 35:04.568
I've got you walking in
with Jeremy Bennett."

35:06.070 --> 35:07.204
<i>He didn't believe me.</i>

35:07.305 --> 35:09.072
<i>He says,
"I wanna see the video."</i>

35:09.173 --> 35:11.341
I did not wanna
show him the video

35:11.442 --> 35:13.643
<i>because I knew based
on the poor quality,</i>

35:13.744 --> 35:15.145
he would simply say,
"that's not me."

35:17.982 --> 35:20.283
And I said, "Andrew, I can't
get that video right now",

35:20.384 --> 35:22.285
but I'm gonna draw out
exactly what you did.

35:23.821 --> 35:25.622
<i>This is the entrance
of the garage.</i>

35:28.926 --> 35:31.761
<i>Jeremy walks in first,
he stops, he turns to you,</i>

35:31.863 --> 35:34.264
<i>and he gestures in
and you follow him.</i>

35:34.365 --> 35:36.266
<i>This is where
Larry Howse is shot.</i>

35:36.367 --> 35:39.069
<i>This is the direction you ran
and then Jeremy ran after you."</i>

35:40.571 --> 35:43.607
<i>When he looked at the map,
his entire body sank.</i>

35:43.708 --> 35:45.008
I knew I had him.

35:49.747 --> 35:53.116
[narrator]<i> Andrew Boyd finally
agrees to a taped interview</i>

35:53.217 --> 35:56.686
<i>to give his version of the
events of Larry Howse's murder.</i>

35:57.688 --> 35:58.655
[Jack speaking]

35:59.357 --> 36:00.190
[Andrew speaking]

36:05.796 --> 36:06.596
[Jack speaking]

36:07.398 --> 36:08.165
[Andrew speaking]

37:01.552 --> 37:03.520
[Jack]<i> I didn't believe his
version of the story at all,</i>

37:03.621 --> 37:07.390
<i>but it really does not matter
who actually pulled the trigger.</i>

37:07.491 --> 37:10.961
<i>In Washington State, we have
a law called Accomplice Liability.</i>

37:11.062 --> 37:14.531
What that means is if
you're involved in any crime,

37:14.632 --> 37:16.533
you're responsible
for everything that happens.

37:16.634 --> 37:18.435
<i>And I had him on tape</i>

37:18.536 --> 37:21.004
<i>admitting that he was present,
that Jeremy was present,</i>

37:21.138 --> 37:23.540
<i>and together they robbed
and murdered Larry Howse.</i>

37:25.243 --> 37:28.044
[narrator]<i> But the hunt for
Boyd's partner in the homicide,</i>

37:28.145 --> 37:30.480
<i>Jeremy Bennett,
turns up nothing.</i>

37:30.581 --> 37:34.184
We had spent all day doing the
interviews and the search warrants,

37:34.285 --> 37:37.354
<i>but we had no idea where he was.</i>

37:37.455 --> 37:40.991
I called the prosecutor up and
I said, "We can't find Jeremy.

37:41.092 --> 37:44.594
I'm really concerned that now he
knows that Andrew Boyd's in custody,

37:44.695 --> 37:46.863
I'm afraid
he'll get out of town."

37:46.964 --> 37:49.832
<i>And there's not gonna be an
arrest warrant in the system.</i>

37:49.900 --> 37:51.201
<i>So I said...</i>

37:51.302 --> 37:54.137
Is it possible to get an arrest
warrant issued right now?

37:54.238 --> 37:56.473
We're going into the weekend.
He's gonna disappear.

37:56.574 --> 37:59.042
<i>He says, "I need you to come
down to the court house right now.</i>

37:59.143 --> 38:01.077
And we're gonna get
an arrest warrant."

38:01.178 --> 38:04.748
<i>So Detective Nasworthy and I
went to the prosecutor's office.</i>

38:05.483 --> 38:07.117
[Jack]<i> As we're walking by,</i>

38:07.218 --> 38:09.986
<i>I look outside the court house.</i>

38:12.790 --> 38:15.659
Both Jack and I are like, "Oh, my
God. That's Jeremy Bennett right there."

38:15.760 --> 38:18.361
So, we ran outside.

38:20.431 --> 38:24.267
Jeremy Bennett,
you're under arrest.

38:24.368 --> 38:27.170
<i>Jeremy was very shocked.
He had no idea.</i>

38:27.271 --> 38:30.240
It sounds like something
that you could write in a movie

38:30.341 --> 38:32.342
and somebody would say, "There
is no way that would really happen."

38:32.443 --> 38:34.210
<i>But it did.</i>

38:34.312 --> 38:37.247
[Vicki]<i> The good thing was
that we had Jeremy Bennett.</i>

38:37.348 --> 38:40.150
The bad thing was that
Detective Nasworthy and I

38:40.251 --> 38:42.719
were the two people
that arrested him.

38:42.820 --> 38:45.922
That's just a bad combo because
you don't wanna be the person

38:46.023 --> 38:47.724
that's putting handcuffs
on somebody,

38:47.825 --> 38:51.294
and then turn around and
want them to be interviewed.

38:51.395 --> 38:53.930
<i>They are mad at you,
they don't like you already.</i>

38:56.967 --> 38:59.469
[Jack]<i> And so</i>
<i>two other detectives came in,</i>

38:59.570 --> 39:01.705
<i>and I was watching the
interview through a two-way mirror.</i>

39:04.608 --> 39:08.645
[narrator]<i> Jeremy gives his version of
what happened at Larry Howse's murder.</i>

39:09.513 --> 39:11.348
[Jack]<i> He explained that, yes,</i>

39:11.449 --> 39:13.950
it was his idea to go Downtown
and make some money.

39:14.051 --> 39:15.485
He brought Andrew with him.

39:17.488 --> 39:20.557
When they saw the BMW,
Jeremy wanted the car

39:20.658 --> 39:24.194
<i>and Andrew agreed to go in
with him and rob Larry Howse.</i>

39:30.768 --> 39:33.236
They surprised Larry Howse.
Larry never even saw him

39:33.337 --> 39:35.405
until Andrew was on him.

39:36.607 --> 39:38.441
Andrew told him
to empty his pockets.

39:41.679 --> 39:44.280
Larry was cooperative.
He emptied his pockets out.

39:47.318 --> 39:49.352
<i>Took off his watch,
turned it all over.</i>

39:51.355 --> 39:53.790
And then Andrew started
telling him to disrobe.

39:55.459 --> 39:58.061
<i>Initially Larry was cooperative.</i>

39:58.162 --> 40:01.431
<i>He took off his shoes and he
folded up his coat and laid it down.</i>

40:02.733 --> 40:04.901
<i>And then Andrew told him
to take off his pants.</i>

40:07.304 --> 40:09.539
<i>That's when Larry refused.</i>

40:10.841 --> 40:12.509
[gunshots]

40:12.610 --> 40:14.711
[narrator]<i> Larry Howse</i>
<i>is shot twice.</i>

40:15.579 --> 40:17.580
<i>But with two versions of events,</i>

40:17.681 --> 40:20.617
<i>no one will ever know
who pulled the trigger.</i>

40:20.718 --> 40:22.919
[Vicki]<i> Andrew and Jeremy</i>
<i>were blaming each other</i>

40:23.020 --> 40:25.688
<i>for being actually the person
who shot Mr. Howse.</i>

40:25.790 --> 40:28.158
We did not ever find the gun.

40:33.130 --> 40:34.998
[narrator]
<i>Before his trial starts</i>

40:35.099 --> 40:38.768
<i>Jeremy Bennett pleads guilty
to the robbery of Larry Howse</i>

40:38.869 --> 40:40.870
<i>and murder in the first degree.</i>

40:42.206 --> 40:46.242
<i>Six months later Andrew
Boyd pleads guilty to robbery</i>

40:46.343 --> 40:48.511
<i>and murder in the first degree.</i>

40:48.612 --> 40:50.647
<i>Both denied being the shooter.</i>

40:50.748 --> 40:53.483
[Jack]<i> Jeremy Bennett</i>
<i>was sentenced to 20 years</i>

40:53.584 --> 40:56.419
for the robbery and murder
of Larry Howse.

40:56.520 --> 41:00.657
And the judge sentenced
Andrew Boyd to 26 years.

41:00.758 --> 41:04.327
[narrator] <i>Jheri Flood pleads
guilty to criminal assistance</i>

41:04.428 --> 41:08.431
<i>for destroying evidence and
receives a 17-month sentence.</i>

41:13.571 --> 41:16.072
[Vicki]<i> No matter what case
you have, you want to solve it,</i>

41:16.173 --> 41:18.208
<i>you want to have justice
for the family.</i>

41:18.309 --> 41:22.745
This one just stood out because
it was like a total random act.

41:22.847 --> 41:25.849
Um, and no witnesses
other than the cameras.

41:27.451 --> 41:30.520
It just didn't make sense,
and it was even

41:30.621 --> 41:32.856
more upsetting to me
that they were so young.

41:34.091 --> 41:37.393
<i>How could you be
so hardened and so young?</i>

41:37.495 --> 41:39.229
<i>They didn't even know
my brother.</i>

41:39.330 --> 41:42.732
They gave him four and
a half minutes, you know.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.300
And that was it,
they rubbed him out.

41:44.401 --> 41:47.203
Like, throwing that paper
plate into the garbage can

41:47.304 --> 41:49.138
<i>at the end of the picnic.
That's all he was.</i>

41:50.641 --> 41:54.110
He was a good guy
and he's missed, you know.

41:54.211 --> 41:56.513
He's loved.

41:56.614 --> 41:58.982
[David]<i> One of the things I've
missed the most about Larry</i>

41:59.083 --> 42:01.618
<i>is getting on the boat
and going crabbing.</i>

42:03.888 --> 42:07.590
His legacy is
you gotta learn how to love,

42:08.459 --> 42:10.927
you gotta be open to love,

42:11.028 --> 42:14.731
you gotta live your life
as fully as you can.

42:17.568 --> 42:19.469
Thank you for loving me.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.572
Thank you for being my friend.

42:23.941 --> 42:27.510
And someday we will get on
that boat and go fishing again.
