Michelle, the horses.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.675
[Michelle] We could
come with you.

06:11.719 --> 06:14.199
I already told you
I'll be quicker alone.

06:14.243 --> 06:15.549
Well take this then.

06:15.592 --> 06:16.724
No, that's for you and Dorian.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.900
Don't worry,
I'll find some more.

06:28.605 --> 06:31.652
You'll be back riding Brownie
by tonight, all right.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.001
I promise.

07:13.781 --> 07:15.696
Hey, Mr., there's still
gold in Greenvale,

07:15.739 --> 07:16.958
have a look.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.572
You can have it for some water.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.967
[man laughing]

07:31.451 --> 07:33.931
-Steve.
-Sheriff.

07:33.975 --> 07:36.804
Two of them are brown
and one's a

07:36.847 --> 07:38.806
skewbald white--

07:38.849 --> 07:40.982
I know what your horses
look like, Steve.

07:42.679 --> 07:44.638
What do you want me to do?

07:44.681 --> 07:46.596
Well, if you went after
the Wilson brothers--

07:46.640 --> 07:48.468
You think Thompson stole them?

07:48.511 --> 07:49.991
They work for him.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.079
Well, I thought you
just said they were gone

07:51.122 --> 07:52.254
by the time got there.

07:52.297 --> 07:53.908
I know it was him, Sheriff.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.653
Steve, I know how you
feel about the man.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.611
I know you think you're
making some pretty wild
assumptions there.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.483
I mean, what with the
livestock shortage

08:03.526 --> 08:04.919
could've been anyone, right?

08:04.962 --> 08:06.573
It's not the
livestock he's after.

08:06.616 --> 08:07.922
It's my land.

08:09.271 --> 08:11.055
I told you he's
been harassing me

08:11.099 --> 08:12.840
and you still
continue to sit there.

08:12.883 --> 08:14.232
You...

08:16.670 --> 08:18.715
I need those horses, Sheriff.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.588
I need to plow my land.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.503
Why?

08:23.546 --> 08:26.897
Has it rained in the
last five goddamn years?

08:26.941 --> 08:28.464
This year it will.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.600
'Cause God decreed it.

08:35.471 --> 08:36.864
Yes.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.695
Listen, Steve, you're
a farmer, right?

08:41.738 --> 08:44.741
Farming's what you do,
I understand that

08:44.785 --> 08:46.613
but if he's offering you
this crazy kind of money

08:46.656 --> 08:51.269
for that piece of shit land,
why don't you just sell it?

08:51.313 --> 08:54.272
Get the fuck outta here.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.231
Buy another piece of
land far, far away.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.015
Start over. Not many people
get that opportunity.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.714
I don't wanna start over.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.672
God has given us another chance.

09:02.716 --> 09:05.632
We can go back to what we
were before the gold rush.

09:05.675 --> 09:07.068
Farmers.

09:08.678 --> 09:11.246
I plow the dry earth
every day since--

09:11.289 --> 09:13.248
-[door rattling]
-When it rains.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.466
What?

09:14.510 --> 09:16.077
Better see for yourself.

09:17.687 --> 09:19.036
I'll see what I can do.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.168
I'll be right here.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.518
Thought you might.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.521
[sinister music]

09:34.791 --> 09:36.619
What can I do for you, folks?

09:36.663 --> 09:37.925
Quinn's back, Sheriff.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.970
-Oh, Quinn.
-That's right.

09:40.014 --> 09:42.494
You gave your word he weren't
gonna bother us no more.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.366
And did he bother your daughter?

09:44.409 --> 09:46.934
-No, but--
-Well, it looks like
I kept my word.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.372
Why don't you do
something, Sheriff?

09:50.415 --> 09:53.027
Did I say I was not gonna
do something about it?

09:54.768 --> 09:57.640
Now you people do your
job and I'll do mine.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.555
All right?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.731
Next time you have
something to tell me

10:01.775 --> 10:04.734
a couple of you will do
not the whole goddamn town.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.431
Now, go on, get outta here.

10:06.475 --> 10:09.652
You heard the
Sheriff, get moving.

10:09.696 --> 10:12.089
[townsfolk chattering]

10:15.266 --> 10:17.399
That's Quinn's final warning.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.140
So, what's the plan?

10:19.183 --> 10:20.707
Plan is we're gonna
earn the paycheck

10:20.750 --> 10:22.665
these people provide us with.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.014
I'm coming too, right?

10:24.058 --> 10:26.408
[chuckles]

10:26.451 --> 10:27.801
Nope.

10:27.844 --> 10:29.585
Come on, Sheriff,
I can be just as good--

10:29.629 --> 10:31.587
New Deputies do not question
orders, they obey them.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.849
You understand?

10:34.677 --> 10:35.722
You understand?

10:35.765 --> 10:36.723
Yes.

10:36.766 --> 10:39.029
So what you gonna do?

10:39.073 --> 10:40.596
Wait for further orders.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.206
That's right.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.339
Make a fine Sheriff one day.

10:44.382 --> 10:45.601
If he's not dead

10:47.516 --> 10:48.996
You'll make it, kid.

10:51.563 --> 10:54.131
[tense music]

10:58.570 --> 11:00.007
Mr. Thompson.

11:02.705 --> 11:05.186
This'll blast you
a hole 10 feet deep.

11:07.492 --> 11:10.234
This will get you down to 20.

11:10.278 --> 11:13.890
But the miners will have
to take it from there.

11:13.934 --> 11:17.241
There are no miners
here anymore.

11:17.285 --> 11:21.071
Francis, I need
to get all the way

11:21.115 --> 11:23.378
to the center of the earth.

11:23.421 --> 11:24.814
On my own.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.646
[door thudding]

11:30.690 --> 11:31.995
Ooh.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.261
These are from Germany.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.654
Soluble nether.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.177
They're much more stable
than nitroglycerine.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.704
How does it react with benzene?

11:44.747 --> 11:46.618
Mix it with benzene
and you risk

11:46.662 --> 11:48.185
meeting the devil
in person, Sir.

11:48.229 --> 11:50.231
[chuckles] Then I'll
take all you got.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.845
Isn't that a pressure balancer?

11:55.889 --> 11:58.021
Very good, Sir.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.457
Works with blood interfusion.

11:59.501 --> 12:00.545
Doesn't it really work?

12:00.589 --> 12:01.721
I can't say for sure.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.548
There's only two in existence.

12:03.592 --> 12:05.855
And the man I sold the other
one to is no longer with us.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.339
Wow.

12:11.382 --> 12:12.906
The original mother.

12:12.949 --> 12:15.343
Created 1833 in Sardinia.

12:15.386 --> 12:17.301
In all probability,

12:17.345 --> 12:19.651
it's the first revolver
in human history.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.047
My gift to you.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.875
No, Francis, no I
can't accept that.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.268
Please.

12:27.311 --> 12:30.271
You and your father were
my very first clients.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.969
You trusted my merchandise
when many wouldn't.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.666
It fills me with enormous joy.

12:41.978 --> 12:43.458
When you come back this way,

12:43.501 --> 12:46.766
I'm gonna decorate your
entire wagon in gold.

12:46.809 --> 12:49.769
-[laughing]
-In the meantime...

12:49.812 --> 12:52.032
Hey, Mr. Wilson, go fetch
those two beautiful horses

12:52.075 --> 12:54.686
we got from the
farmer yesterday.

12:54.730 --> 12:58.125
-[tense music]
-My gift to you.

12:58.168 --> 13:00.910
Now, what do I owe you
for the explosives?

13:06.394 --> 13:07.874
[McCoy] Oh, Quinn?

13:10.093 --> 13:13.270
[gun barrel whizzing]

13:13.314 --> 13:16.099
Hey, Quinn?

13:16.143 --> 13:17.971
You remember the
one about the snake?

13:18.014 --> 13:21.888
Goes back to his lair, gets
killed by the other snake.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.153
Give him time.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.330
See how he wants to check out.

13:32.637 --> 13:35.292
[Henry] Christ, McCoy,
rather take a bullet

13:35.336 --> 13:37.033
then stay out here in this heat.

13:37.077 --> 13:39.862
Let's just do what we came to.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.864
Are you the Sheriff or am I?

13:41.908 --> 13:44.127
We move when I tell us to move.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.825
-You piece of...
-[door thudding]

13:45.868 --> 13:47.391
[tense music]

13:47.435 --> 13:49.350
-[horse neighing]
-[gun clicking]

13:54.485 --> 13:56.923
Who the hell are you?
Where's Quinn?

13:57.662 --> 13:59.795
Oh, Quinn.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.364
Wanting for rape and murder
in three separate counties.

14:03.407 --> 14:04.800
That's the one.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.149
He's in here.

14:12.460 --> 14:13.940
And who might you be?

14:13.983 --> 14:15.202
I'm Red Bill.

14:15.245 --> 14:17.465
[Sheriff laughing]

14:17.508 --> 14:19.380
Red Bill.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.602
[tense music]

14:24.646 --> 14:25.952
[flies buzzing]

14:25.995 --> 14:28.302
The head weighs
less than the body.

14:32.045 --> 14:34.177
Careful, Sheriff, if you
disfigure those faces,

14:34.221 --> 14:36.266
how are you gonna recognize 'em?

14:36.310 --> 14:37.877
Why would I wanna recognize 'em?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.617
So you can pay me the
bounties you owe on 'em.

14:39.661 --> 14:40.967
[McCoy] You gotta be
kidding me, right?

14:41.010 --> 14:42.620
No, that's the law.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.318
These warrants, they're
wanted dead or alive.

14:44.361 --> 14:45.493
And where's the law that says
you can walk around the country,

14:45.536 --> 14:47.190
chopping people's heads off.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.409
These aren't good
people, Sheriff.

14:48.452 --> 14:50.237
-And you are?
-[gun cocking]

14:50.280 --> 14:52.892
Well, I haven't done
nothing illegal.

14:52.935 --> 14:56.112
So you might tell
your two boys here

14:56.156 --> 14:58.898
that they can lower
their weapons.

14:58.941 --> 15:02.118
[suspenseful music]

15:06.296 --> 15:09.430
You know we don't like
bounty hunters around here.

15:09.473 --> 15:10.692
Especially ones
that get in the way

15:10.735 --> 15:12.041
of us carrying out our duty.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.695
[Red whistling]

15:13.738 --> 15:15.915
[horse neighing]

15:15.958 --> 15:18.439
So I suggest you take
your face and you stink

15:18.482 --> 15:21.964
and whatever that is
in your bag and...

15:22.008 --> 15:25.315
Well I've already
got what I came for.

15:25.359 --> 15:27.230
Do I make myself clear, Mister?

15:28.014 --> 15:29.841
You do your job, Sheriff

15:29.885 --> 15:33.628
-and I'll do mine.
-[horse neighing]

15:33.671 --> 15:36.892
You keep your crazy ass
outta my jurisdiction,

15:36.936 --> 15:38.328
you understand?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.071
Son of a bitch.

15:43.638 --> 15:44.726
Come on.

15:44.769 --> 15:47.294
[tense music]

15:55.737 --> 15:57.086
Well.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.697
Oh, shit.

16:04.050 --> 16:08.054
Be clear about one
thing, all right.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.316
We killed Quinn.

16:11.622 --> 16:12.754
All right?

16:12.797 --> 16:13.929
Yeah.

16:15.931 --> 16:18.934
[McCoy] Henry, you
clean this mess up.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.936
We'll head back to town.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.721
[upbeat music]

16:58.887 --> 17:01.716
How proud do you think you'd be?

17:01.759 --> 17:03.587
Emptying my stables?

17:03.631 --> 17:05.546
Destroying my tools,
raising my fields?

17:05.589 --> 17:07.374
What do you want?

17:07.417 --> 17:10.203
I'm not leaving.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.596
As God is my witness, I'll
never sell to you, Thompson.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.771
Hagen won't either.

17:18.515 --> 17:21.431
Most of the land in
Greenvale was mine already.

17:21.475 --> 17:25.870
As for Hagen, he'll give
in soon and you will too.

17:25.914 --> 17:28.438
It's just to matter of time.

17:28.482 --> 17:31.485
Then I'll have the gold
and you'll die of thirst

17:31.528 --> 17:33.922
waiting for your
God to make it rain.

17:33.965 --> 17:36.403
-The gold's all gone.
-Is that right?

17:36.446 --> 17:38.405
It was gone five years ago

17:38.448 --> 17:40.407
just before the streets
started running with blood.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.757
When we all forgot
what the hell we were.

17:43.845 --> 17:44.976
Farmers.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.589
Decent people.

17:48.632 --> 17:52.288
The great vein is beneath
us here somewhere.

17:55.552 --> 17:58.512
-According to my calculations--
-What calculations of those?

18:00.644 --> 18:02.864
The ones that made
you divert a river,

18:02.907 --> 18:05.606
bringing drought to us
and death to 200 miners?

18:07.303 --> 18:09.392
My father died in those mines.

18:10.828 --> 18:13.004
How do you sleep at night?

18:15.050 --> 18:17.661
Like a baby.

18:17.705 --> 18:22.057
And when I do I dream of that
golden city I'm gonna build.

18:23.754 --> 18:26.192
How long do you really
think you can hold out?

18:26.235 --> 18:27.410
As long as it takes.

18:30.326 --> 18:33.721
Well, then you
better keep praying.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.815
I'll pray for you as well.

18:40.858 --> 18:43.426
[tense music]

18:54.350 --> 18:57.527
[gun barrel whizzing]

18:59.529 --> 19:02.489
[Kurt] That's a federal coach.

19:02.532 --> 19:03.881
That's a robbery going bad.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.538
Didn't you tell Jessie
to stay in town?

19:09.757 --> 19:10.975
Fucking Jessie.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.414
[horse neighing]

19:14.457 --> 19:17.678
[suspenseful music]

19:27.209 --> 19:30.734
Hey Jessie, you stay
right there, you hear?

19:30.778 --> 19:32.519
[Jessie] All right, Sheriff.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.260
An ambush.

19:34.303 --> 19:35.478
Yes, Kurt, an ambush.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.657
It's like that one got killed
from somewhere up there,

19:40.701 --> 19:42.355
about 400 yards.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.574
Caused the others
to trip over it.

19:46.315 --> 19:49.318
[horse neighing]

19:49.362 --> 19:52.495
[Kurt] He was pretty fast.

19:52.539 --> 19:56.717
Takes a peacemaker a tenth
of a second to fire a bullet.

20:01.896 --> 20:04.768
Whereas a trained
man, such as yourself,

20:04.812 --> 20:09.686
it's pull cock and fire,
take three-tenths of a second.

20:09.730 --> 20:10.905
Whereas me.

20:12.515 --> 20:13.908
I take half that time.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.215
No shit.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.614
Body's still warm.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.138
[gun cocking]

20:27.182 --> 20:28.749
[tense music]

20:28.792 --> 20:31.534
[guns booming]

20:43.372 --> 20:45.635
Nice shootin'.

20:45.679 --> 20:46.941
Thanks.

20:49.073 --> 20:52.207
[suspenseful music]

21:04.045 --> 21:05.568
Jesus Christ.

21:09.616 --> 21:13.228
-[lid thudding]
-It's only money, Jessie.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.231
What you wanna think about
what happens to the bad guys.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.891
[upbeat music]

21:30.027 --> 21:32.595
[horse neighing]

21:34.380 --> 21:35.598
Good afternoon, Sheriff.

21:36.730 --> 21:39.298
Good afternoon, Eve.

21:39.341 --> 21:42.083
Are you admiring your kingdom?

21:42.126 --> 21:45.521
The amount of work you put
into this goddamn place.

21:45.565 --> 21:47.741
[Eve] It's our damn town, McCoy.

21:47.784 --> 21:50.744
[McCoy] Well, no wonder
your people adore you

21:50.787 --> 21:53.399
Here's your cut of
the weekly taxes.

21:53.442 --> 21:55.836
There's a little
extra there for you.

21:55.879 --> 21:57.403
Why?

21:57.446 --> 21:59.361
Well, why not?

21:59.405 --> 22:00.623
I'm in a good mood.

22:04.105 --> 22:06.847
It's hard to believe there
was ever gold in this town.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.503
Tell me what it was like.

22:10.546 --> 22:11.591
You've heard it all before.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.419
Indulge me.

22:13.462 --> 22:17.858
Everyone had pockets full
of gold and muddy boots.

22:19.076 --> 22:20.469
And then the gold ran out.

22:20.513 --> 22:21.862
And you never found any?

22:23.429 --> 22:26.345
I was just a whore.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.651
You were never
just a whore, Eve.

22:31.785 --> 22:35.049
The settler convoys are
gonna arrive any day now.

22:35.092 --> 22:38.531
I need more water for my
girls and the men to know

22:38.574 --> 22:40.707
that the only place they can
get a decent bath is here.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.317
Oh, that's what the
men come here for?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.101
A decent bath.

22:45.799 --> 22:48.541
They will.

22:48.584 --> 22:50.543
I'm gonna meet
the water suppliers.

22:50.586 --> 22:53.372
I'm gonna try to convince
them to lower their prices.

22:53.415 --> 22:56.636
[chuckles] Sure,
whatever you want.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.681
I want water for the whole town.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.513
May I ask?

23:04.557 --> 23:08.996
All these grand ideas,
where are they gonna lead?

23:11.259 --> 23:12.739
To the moon, McCoy.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.395
To the moon.

23:24.359 --> 23:25.795
[man groaning]

23:25.839 --> 23:27.797
Again, a man with an eye carved

23:27.841 --> 23:30.147
into the handle of his Bowie.

23:30.191 --> 23:31.714
I don't know him.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.373
-[foot thudding]
-[man groaning]

23:39.418 --> 23:40.331
[ax whooshing]

23:40.375 --> 23:41.507
[screams] Oh, God, no!

23:43.770 --> 23:46.773
If you had,
I might've let you live.

23:46.816 --> 23:47.904
Please.

23:48.818 --> 23:50.124
Please.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.909
-[ax whooshing]
-[tense music]

23:52.953 --> 23:54.563
[horse neighing]

23:54.607 --> 23:56.347
You all right?

24:07.837 --> 24:10.405
Yeah, yeah, like that?

24:10.449 --> 24:13.408
You like that?

24:13.452 --> 24:15.758
I think we should stick
around a little longer.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.980
[suspenseful music]

24:23.984 --> 24:26.421
[flames blazing]

24:26.465 --> 24:28.554
[tense music]

24:42.698 --> 24:45.614
[Woman] Please, God, please.

24:45.658 --> 24:48.835
[woman yelling]

24:51.577 --> 24:54.318
[woman crying]

24:56.886 --> 24:59.628
The things you'll do for money.

24:59.672 --> 25:01.456
[gasps]

25:02.805 --> 25:03.850
[Woman] Billy.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.808
[flames flickering]

25:13.729 --> 25:14.861
[horse neighing]

25:14.904 --> 25:16.340
Everyone ready?

25:18.038 --> 25:19.518
Looking good, Simone.

25:22.695 --> 25:25.219
Okay, ladies, it's showtime.

25:27.047 --> 25:28.483
[glasses clink]

25:32.139 --> 25:33.488
It's over my friend.

25:35.359 --> 25:39.842
After years of scratching
around with pennies and dimes.

25:41.322 --> 25:44.717
We found $200,000
fucking dollars.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.458
-[laughing]
-[Kurt whistles]

25:50.374 --> 25:52.072
Why Italy?

25:52.115 --> 25:54.074
I told you, it's where
my mama's from.

25:55.379 --> 25:57.947
Yeah, green, lush rolling hills.

25:57.991 --> 25:59.862
Ancient architecture.

25:59.906 --> 26:03.126
-[Kurt laughing]
-What?

26:03.170 --> 26:04.780
What?

26:04.824 --> 26:06.913
Since when are you interested
in ancient architecture?

26:06.956 --> 26:08.741
There's a lot about me
you don't know.

26:08.784 --> 26:11.004
But you got a good point.

26:12.005 --> 26:13.746
All right, how about the women?

26:13.789 --> 26:15.530
We got those in America too.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.444
-You know that.
-All right.

26:16.487 --> 26:18.315
[laughing]

26:18.359 --> 26:20.709
How about

26:20.753 --> 26:22.929
'cause it's a long, long,

26:22.972 --> 26:26.497
long way from this
fucking place.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.984
[suspenseful music]

26:52.001 --> 26:53.960
[townsfolk quietly chattering]

26:54.003 --> 26:56.005
[horse neighing]

27:15.242 --> 27:16.460
Water.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.854
You got money?

27:19.812 --> 27:21.161
Good.

27:21.204 --> 27:22.641
'Cause water will
cost you a lot more

27:22.684 --> 27:24.425
than whiskey around here.

27:24.468 --> 27:25.774
Yeah.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.124
This too.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.957
[Man] I heard
the Sheriff got Quinn.

27:38.657 --> 27:39.962
[glass thudding]

27:41.921 --> 27:44.227
I'm looking for two brothers.

27:44.271 --> 27:46.316
Name's Wilson.

27:46.360 --> 27:50.016
I heard these outlaws work
for someone called Thompson.

27:50.059 --> 27:53.454
Whoever they are,
I didn't see them.

27:53.497 --> 27:54.977
And if you want to stay here,

27:55.021 --> 27:56.849
you have to leave that outside.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.154
It's messing up my saloon.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.723
I can't do that, sorry.

28:01.767 --> 28:02.985
Now gimme a whiskey.

28:04.508 --> 28:06.380
And he had a roll
of money this big.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.251
So he must've killed
a bunch of 'em.

28:08.295 --> 28:10.819
Why do you reckon he
chops their heads off?

28:10.863 --> 28:13.822
Oh, Phil also said he
killed a man with a bullet

28:13.866 --> 28:15.955
-but without even using a gun--
-Jesus Christ, Jessie,

28:15.998 --> 28:18.218
don't believe all
the bullshit you hear.

28:19.306 --> 28:21.047
[door thudding]

28:24.703 --> 28:26.095
[gun cocking]

28:26.139 --> 28:28.228
[tutting] Breaking the
law already, Billy.

28:35.670 --> 28:38.064
Congratulations,
I heard you got Quinn.

28:40.675 --> 28:43.112
Yes, I did.

28:43.156 --> 28:46.072
'Cause I protect these people
from the likes of you.

28:49.684 --> 28:52.687
I told you to stay
outta my jurisdiction.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.515
Which you did not do,
that's breaking the law.

28:54.558 --> 28:56.256
I just made up for you.

28:56.299 --> 28:58.040
Vagrants who disobey my
orders, lose their gun.

28:59.650 --> 29:01.087
And pay a fine.

29:02.828 --> 29:03.916
[gun tapping]

29:03.959 --> 29:05.221
Well, go on, pay up.

29:22.151 --> 29:24.110
That's not enough.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.858
$20.00 more ought to do it.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.472
No wonder you wouldn't pay me.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.301
The town coffers are empty.

29:49.483 --> 29:51.702
Red.

29:51.746 --> 29:53.922
-[gun cocking]
-[anxious music]

29:57.665 --> 29:59.754
You forgot your canteen.

30:03.236 --> 30:05.847
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot that
law contains a subsection.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.370
Vagrants who disobey my orders

30:07.414 --> 30:09.155
also lose their right to water.

30:12.419 --> 30:14.203
Gentlemen, you're
forbidden to sell, trade,

30:14.247 --> 30:15.770
or donate even a single
drop to the offending party.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.641
When you finally
decide to leave town,

30:17.685 --> 30:20.731
come to my office, I will
give you back your gun.

30:20.775 --> 30:22.603
And don't be too long about it.

30:22.646 --> 30:24.170
You understand?

30:25.432 --> 30:26.912
Son of a bitch.

30:31.264 --> 30:32.831
[Man] Let's see what you got?

30:45.669 --> 30:47.671
-Every time.
-[laughing]

30:47.715 --> 30:49.978
How the hell do you do that?

30:50.022 --> 30:52.067
His dad was a grocer.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.417
Grew up playing one
of those things.

30:54.461 --> 30:57.638
And you couldn't have
told me that before?

30:57.681 --> 31:00.859
I learned the hard way,
why shouldn't you?

31:00.902 --> 31:02.991
[door rattling]

31:03.035 --> 31:04.384
The bounty hunter's gone.

31:04.427 --> 31:06.038
-What?
-He left.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.910
He was seen heading
west towards the bridge.

31:08.954 --> 31:10.912
Well, how about that?

31:10.956 --> 31:12.653
The infamous Red Bill.

31:12.696 --> 31:14.742
Smoke was far from his ass.

31:14.785 --> 31:16.700
Apparently didn't have the
courage to come to say goodbye.

31:16.744 --> 31:19.878
Well, looks like our friend

31:19.921 --> 31:22.619
has sponsored you boys
a night with the ladies.

31:22.663 --> 31:24.970
-Well you ain't comin'?
-Nope.

31:25.013 --> 31:26.623
I'm going to the old station.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.583
Next time, asshole.

31:31.846 --> 31:35.197
[Man] Hey, McCoy, what you
doing at the station?

31:35.241 --> 31:36.851
I'm meeting Eve.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.809
She wants to fix up
the road station.

31:38.853 --> 31:41.334
Lower the price of water.
She has got real vision.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.905
Where is my horse?

31:48.297 --> 31:50.038
Where the hell is my horse?

31:51.953 --> 31:55.696
Christ, please tell me
this is not happening.

31:55.739 --> 31:57.872
Nathan, go catch up with him.

31:58.699 --> 31:59.830
Really?

31:59.874 --> 32:01.658
His unarmed, so it's him.

32:01.702 --> 32:03.747
Bring him back here,
you think you can do that?

32:03.791 --> 32:05.314
Well, go.

32:08.970 --> 32:11.277
[anxious music]

32:19.633 --> 32:24.768
[Steve] I'm desperate
and I thought that maybe...

32:24.812 --> 32:27.467
That if, if you
could have a word.

32:30.513 --> 32:32.689
McCoy, doesn't care
about your horses.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.738
Does he care about this town,
'cause Thompson's killing it.

32:37.781 --> 32:38.913
Steve.

32:40.132 --> 32:42.786
This dream of yours...

32:42.830 --> 32:45.876
Seeing this area prosper
and thrive again,

32:45.920 --> 32:47.313
we've got to give it up.

33:03.024 --> 33:05.070
Without dreams what are we?

33:10.945 --> 33:12.599
I'm not gonna help you.

33:16.385 --> 33:17.821
Why not?

33:17.865 --> 33:19.780
Did you truly come
here expecting me

33:19.823 --> 33:22.304
to help you save the very
thing that drove us apart?

33:26.787 --> 33:28.223
Christ.

33:30.617 --> 33:33.533
I fell in love with
a man who was strong.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.752
And whose beliefs made
some kind of sense.

33:36.753 --> 33:38.016
Look at you.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.367
Why did you come here?

33:51.246 --> 33:53.553
Because you wanted to see me.

33:56.991 --> 33:59.341
[gentle music]

33:59.385 --> 34:00.864
Because you think
about me every day

34:00.908 --> 34:03.563
and you can't resist anymore.

34:07.610 --> 34:10.004
Because you can't
live without me.

34:21.885 --> 34:26.586
Even if you got your horse's
back nothing would change.

34:30.416 --> 34:33.027
This future you see,
it's just a dream.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.378
You are my dream.

34:53.178 --> 34:56.006
[anxious music]

35:01.838 --> 35:03.927
[wind whistling]

35:05.625 --> 35:07.844
[horse hooves thumping]

35:10.325 --> 35:11.848
[Nathan] Greenvale Sheriff.

35:11.892 --> 35:13.023
Stop.

35:14.068 --> 35:16.462
[horse neighing]

35:21.510 --> 35:24.034
[Red] Now would be your
chance to turn back.

35:29.257 --> 35:30.911
[ax whooshing]

35:30.954 --> 35:32.608
[horse neighing]

35:38.701 --> 35:40.268
[horse hooves thumping]

35:48.537 --> 35:49.756
Simone?

35:58.808 --> 36:03.552
-Oh my gosh, you are--
-Running late.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.511
Come on, give me a hand.

36:12.474 --> 36:13.693
How'd it go?

36:15.085 --> 36:16.522
What?

36:16.565 --> 36:17.784
[Simone] With him.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.136
Tighter.

36:27.837 --> 36:30.492
[Simone] I hate to
see you this way.

36:30.536 --> 36:32.712
Don't worry about it.

36:34.801 --> 36:37.369
But why should you have
to suffer like this?

36:37.412 --> 36:40.894
I mean, you can have him
for yourself if you wanted.

36:40.937 --> 36:42.330
Right?

36:42.374 --> 36:44.289
You're beautiful.

36:45.115 --> 36:47.030
You're powerful.

36:47.074 --> 36:49.729
And I've never seen you
give up on anything.

36:51.252 --> 36:52.688
Yeah, but then what?

36:54.734 --> 36:56.214
Live the rest of my days

36:56.257 --> 36:57.954
as the shabby worn-down
wife of a farmer.

37:01.784 --> 37:04.178
You and I are destined
for better things.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.311
Hmm?

37:06.354 --> 37:08.530
With your beauty,
you'll achieve anything.

37:11.098 --> 37:12.621
You know what?
Come with me.

37:12.665 --> 37:14.710
-You're kidding.
-No, I'm not.

37:14.754 --> 37:17.974
Only sorry I didn't
think of it before.

37:18.018 --> 37:19.541
Pick out a dress.

37:29.899 --> 37:33.251
[stone clipping]

37:33.294 --> 37:36.993
Come on now, it's time
for you to go home.

37:37.037 --> 37:38.952
Why?

37:38.995 --> 37:40.345
I told you already.

37:42.303 --> 37:45.785
I was requested to guard
this place for McCoy.

37:45.828 --> 37:48.048
You're wasting your
time playing sheriff.

37:48.091 --> 37:51.443
We'll always be losers if we
don't have a dime to our name.

37:51.486 --> 37:53.227
Speak for yourself.

37:54.315 --> 37:55.577
I've got money.

37:57.492 --> 38:00.060
Shut up, you don't got no money.

38:00.103 --> 38:01.496
[chuckles] I got money.

38:02.584 --> 38:05.370
[stone tapping]

38:10.070 --> 38:11.376
You wanna see it?

38:15.684 --> 38:19.384
You can't tell no one, got it?

38:19.427 --> 38:21.647
[suspenseful music]

38:23.910 --> 38:25.694
This will be my percentage.

38:25.738 --> 38:28.784
-Why you hide it here?
-Where we supposed to put it?

38:36.270 --> 38:38.620
[horse neighing]

38:52.112 --> 38:54.810
[goats bleating]

38:57.596 --> 39:00.425
I'm looking for
the Wilson brothers.

39:00.468 --> 39:01.817
You know where I might find 'em?

39:03.776 --> 39:07.040
Probably find 'em just
behind those hills.

39:11.566 --> 39:13.916
[Red] Got water for your goats?

39:13.960 --> 39:15.135
Uh-huh.

39:15.178 --> 39:17.093
Yeah, I'm not gonna hurt you.

39:17.137 --> 39:19.661
If you have more, I can
pay you handsomely for it.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.450
[goats bleating]

39:29.541 --> 39:31.978
[water splashing]

39:35.547 --> 39:38.376
Um, beggars can't be choosers.

39:41.596 --> 39:44.164
So how often do these
two come through here?

39:44.207 --> 39:46.166
Nearly every day.

39:46.209 --> 39:48.690
In the beginning,
they only took my food.

39:49.561 --> 39:52.390
Now they steal my animals too.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.696
Yeah, well not for much longer.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.875
How much do I owe you
for the water?

39:59.919 --> 40:01.573
Oh.

40:01.616 --> 40:04.619
No, no, no, you rid me
of these sons of bitches

40:04.663 --> 40:06.404
sounds like payment enough.

40:08.449 --> 40:09.842
Oh, thank you.

40:23.159 --> 40:24.639
So uh,

40:24.683 --> 40:26.815
that's your collection, huh?

40:26.859 --> 40:28.469
Head weighs less than the body.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.428
[chuckles] I guess it does.

40:30.471 --> 40:33.605
Tell me something.

40:33.648 --> 40:36.869
How many men have you
killed in your life?

40:39.611 --> 40:42.178
Oh, come on, don't be bashful.

40:42.222 --> 40:44.746
I ain't never met
a bounty hunter before.

40:46.618 --> 40:48.620
Tell me about all the

40:48.663 --> 40:53.407
bastards you consign for...

40:54.190 --> 40:55.453
What?

40:55.496 --> 40:58.586
[surreal mumbling]

41:16.822 --> 41:19.825
[Red groaning]

41:22.523 --> 41:25.439
[surreal mumbling]

41:25.483 --> 41:28.007
[tense music]

41:31.227 --> 41:33.186
[Red groaning]

41:37.538 --> 41:40.541
Yep, that was him all right.

41:40.585 --> 41:42.238
[McCoy] Where is he then?

41:43.936 --> 41:45.198
I lost him.

41:47.505 --> 41:48.984
You lost him?

41:49.028 --> 41:51.030
[Nathan]
Mac, he was pretty fast.

41:51.073 --> 41:52.553
Fast enough to outride
you on one horse

41:52.597 --> 41:54.729
while leading another?

41:54.773 --> 41:57.297
-I'll go find myself.
-Mac?

41:57.340 --> 41:59.691
Find Henry tell to set
the gals up in town.

41:59.734 --> 42:01.519
Show everyone how
horse thieving assholes

42:01.562 --> 42:02.694
are treated in Greenvale.

42:02.737 --> 42:04.870
You think you could manage that?

42:04.913 --> 42:06.436
I'm sorry, Mac.

42:07.568 --> 42:09.439
Oh, you're sorry?

42:09.483 --> 42:11.224
[chuckling]

42:11.267 --> 42:13.269
I always knew you
were a chicken shit.

42:15.663 --> 42:18.492
[door thudding]

42:19.449 --> 42:22.235
[door thudding]

42:27.675 --> 42:29.459
Mac?

42:29.503 --> 42:30.896
Mac?

42:32.550 --> 42:34.856
What are you doing?

42:34.900 --> 42:37.555
Mac, we don't need this.

42:37.598 --> 42:39.295
Help with the bounty hunter,

42:39.339 --> 42:41.559
we've got other
pressing problems
we need to take care of.

42:41.602 --> 42:43.691
Then we need to be on
our way like you said.

42:43.735 --> 42:45.606
Before some...

42:45.650 --> 42:48.522
Before someone comes
looking for that money.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.698
Hey, you hear me?

42:51.481 --> 42:52.831
Mac.

42:52.874 --> 42:54.702
Mac.

42:54.746 --> 42:56.530
We don't care about this.

43:04.625 --> 43:06.540
[finger tapping]

43:13.242 --> 43:14.940
I told you not to come out here.

43:14.983 --> 43:15.984
It's dangerous.

43:24.993 --> 43:27.343
I wasn't able
to find them, sorry.

43:32.435 --> 43:33.915
Carr architects, huh?

43:37.571 --> 43:38.746
They're also killers.

43:45.448 --> 43:47.450
Well, I guess bugs
don't have a choice.

43:49.670 --> 43:52.194
You and me, on the other hand,

43:52.238 --> 43:55.633
we get to decide for ourselves
what kind of men we're gonna be.

44:00.768 --> 44:02.204
Go on back to the house.

44:02.248 --> 44:03.858
Go on.

44:09.385 --> 44:11.170
Okay, go on.

44:14.303 --> 44:17.002
[suspenseful music]

[anxious music]

45:37.691 --> 45:40.650
[wind whispering]

45:43.958 --> 45:46.047
Jessie, Jessie, Jessie.

45:47.527 --> 45:49.877
You really had to
come follow us?

45:49.921 --> 45:52.532
I just wanted to see
where you put it.

45:52.575 --> 45:54.229
[McCoy laughing]

45:54.273 --> 45:57.232
You didn't tell anyone
else now, did ya?

45:57.276 --> 45:58.668
No one, Sheriff.

45:58.712 --> 46:00.322
You promise me?

46:00.366 --> 46:02.150
I swear, I swear.

46:03.282 --> 46:04.849
All right, off you go.

46:06.589 --> 46:07.721
Go on.

[gun booming]

46:22.823 --> 46:25.521
[tense music]

46:31.136 --> 46:33.312
All he had to do
was obey orders.

46:35.401 --> 46:38.143
[Kurt] Great, now we
have to bury two bodies.

46:45.672 --> 46:47.587
[Red groaning]

46:47.630 --> 46:48.936
[surreal music]

46:48.980 --> 46:51.547
[Women yelling]

46:51.591 --> 46:52.722
No.

46:52.766 --> 46:53.854
[sword whooshing]

46:53.898 --> 46:55.769
[Red] Peace, deformity.

46:58.337 --> 47:00.556
[anxious music]

47:04.647 --> 47:06.824
[cleaver thudding]

[door creaking]

47:28.889 --> 47:30.760
[food splattering]

47:32.501 --> 47:35.069
I suggest you eat this
before the flies come.

47:38.899 --> 47:40.596
I need your strength.

47:40.640 --> 47:43.164
You're gonna be
my guest a while.

47:48.039 --> 47:49.388
It's delicious.

47:50.519 --> 47:51.825
It's your horse.

47:56.656 --> 47:59.137
[door creaking]

47:59.180 --> 48:00.660
[tense music]

48:00.703 --> 48:02.227
[yelling]

48:02.270 --> 48:04.577
Fuck you. Fuck you!

48:13.629 --> 48:15.457
Shit.

48:15.501 --> 48:16.981
Look at Jessie.

48:19.418 --> 48:20.636
Those damn kids.

48:23.465 --> 48:25.424
[horse neighing]

48:32.083 --> 48:34.650
Let's go get that
horse-thieving son of a bitch.

48:43.703 --> 48:46.097
[theme music]
