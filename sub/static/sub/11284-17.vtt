16:34.243 --> 16:35.426
JULES:
XAVIER, THERE'S NO SAMPLE
ON THE PREMISES.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.195
WE CHECKED IT OUT.

16:38.431 --> 16:39.497
NO...

16:40.500 --> 16:41.566
<i> NO...</i>

16:43.169 --> 16:44.635
NO! WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE YOU?

16:44.637 --> 16:46.304
<i> APPLEWHITE:</i>
<i> YOU CAN CHECK THE RECORDS.</i>

16:46.306 --> 16:48.172
THAT ENTIRE BATCH

16:48.174 --> 16:49.173
OR DISCARDED BY NOW.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.742
IT'LL BE IN THE RECORDS.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.143
I WANNA SEE THOSE RECORDS.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.578
I WANT OUELLETTE
TO SEE THOSE RECORDS.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.279
I WANT HIM TO SEE EVERYTHING!

16:55.281 --> 16:57.348
<i> I WANNA KNOW EXACTLY</i>
<i> WHAT I WAS GIVEN!</i>

16:57.350 --> 16:59.384
<i> I WANNA KNOW EXACTLY</i>
<i> WHAT WAS IN IT!</i>

16:59.386 --> 17:03.054
SOMETHING YOU PUT INSIDE ME
MADE ME SICK.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.223
I HEAR YOU.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.627
LOOK AT ME.
I HEAR YOU, ALL RIGHT?

17:11.031 --> 17:13.264
<i> NOW, IF R.D.A. GIVES </i>
<i> DR. OUELLETTE ACCESS,</i>

17:13.266 --> 17:17.301
WILL YOU PLEASE LET THESE PEOPLE
FINISH THEIR WORK HERE?

17:17.303 --> 17:19.070
YOU MAKE THAT HAPPEN,
YOU GOT A DEAL.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.141
<i> SPIKE:</i>
<i> BOSS, XAVIER'S WIFE IS HERE.</i>

17:23.143 --> 17:24.208

17:28.281 --> 17:29.480
OKAY, WE NEED TO TALK
OVER HERE.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.817
NO, NO. THIS SHOULDN'T BE
HAPPENING.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.153
THEY FORCED HIM
TO TAKE THE VACCINES.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.271
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

17:36.272 --> 17:37.388
IT WAS A CONDITION
OF HIS EMPLOYMENT

17:37.390 --> 17:38.756
WHEN HE STARTED HERE -

17:38.758 --> 17:41.009
<i> FOR HIS "PROTECTION."</i>

17:41.010 --> 17:43.261
COMPULSORY VACCINATIONS.
JUST LIKE THE GULF WAR SOLDIERS.

17:43.263 --> 17:46.497
PARKER:
DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL
FOR SOME OF THEM EITHER.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.832
SOON AFTER THAT

17:47.833 --> 17:49.166
HE STARTED GETTING
THESE MUSCLE CRAMPS,

17:49.169 --> 17:51.469
SPASMS IN HIS ARMS
AND SHOULDERS,

17:51.471 --> 17:53.071
MIGRAINES.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.139
R.D.A'S IN-HOUSE DOCTOR
SAID THAT...

17:55.141 --> 17:57.208
IT WAS ALL IN HIS MIND,

17:57.210 --> 17:58.609
LIKE WHAT HE NEEDED
WAS A BETTER ATTITUDE.

17:58.611 --> 18:01.679
BUT XAVIER KEPT
GETTING WORSE.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.148
AFTER THEY FIRED HIM,

18:04.150 --> 18:06.551
WE TRACKED DOWN THIS DOCTOR
WHO STUDIES VACCINES

18:06.553 --> 18:07.785
AND THEIR SIDE EFFECTS.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.187
AND THIS WAS DR. OUELLETTE?

18:09.189 --> 18:12.790
YEAH, AND WE WENT FOR
A SECOND OPINION.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.862
LOU GHERIG'S DISEASE.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.198
I'VE RULED OUT PRETTY MUCH
EVERY OTHER POSSIBILITY.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.567
NOW, THE EMG CONFIRMS IT.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.868
WHAT IS THAT,
LIKE A...

18:23.870 --> 18:25.636
(CLEARS THROAT)
BRAIN DISEASE?

18:25.638 --> 18:27.205
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS,

18:27.207 --> 18:29.807
YOUR MOTOR FUNCTIONS
WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE,

18:29.809 --> 18:32.477
YOU'LL LOSE CONTROL
OF YOUR MOVEMENT.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.679
<i> VALERIE:</i>
<i> AND THERE'S...</i>

18:34.681 --> 18:36.648

<i> OUELLETTE:</i>
<i> THE ALS RUNS ITS COURSE</i>
<i> IN TWO TO THREE YEARS, </i>

18:38.618 --> 18:40.151

18:40.153 --> 18:43.387
UM, THEN RESPIRATORY FAILURE
SETS IN.

18:43.389 --> 18:46.557
BUT HIS MIND WILL BE
NORMAL?

18:46.559 --> 18:48.192
EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T MOVE
OR SPEAK,

18:48.194 --> 18:49.360
IT'S STILL YOU IN THERE.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.465
XAVIER:
THREE YEARS...

18:58.505 --> 19:00.304
SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS,
THIS IN-HOUSE DOCTOR,

19:00.306 --> 19:02.273
WHY DIDN'T HE DISCOVER
THE ALS?

19:02.275 --> 19:04.342
CONVENIENT, ISN'T IT?

19:04.344 --> 19:05.877
AND YOU TRIED LEGAL ACTION?

19:05.879 --> 19:07.212
THREE DIFFERENT LAWYERS.

19:07.213 --> 19:08.546
THEY ALL SAID SORRY
FOR YOUR LUCK,

19:08.548 --> 19:10.281
THERE'S NO PROOF
THE VACCINES MADE HIM SICK.

19:10.283 --> 19:13.217
THAT'S WHY XAVIER WAS TRYING
TO GET A SAMPLE FOR TESTING.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.552
WHY THE GUN?

19:14.554 --> 19:16.754
HE HAD NO CHOICE.

19:16.756 --> 19:17.755
THEY WEREN'T EXACTLY
GONNA LET HIM

19:17.757 --> 19:18.756
WALK IN THE FRONT DOOR.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.358
OH, AND HE'S DYING.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.794
YOU GOT THAT PART,
RIGHT?

19:23.796 --> 19:25.296
OKAY, I NEED TO GO
TO WORK HERE

19:25.298 --> 19:26.164

19:26.166 --> 19:27.765

19:27.767 --> 19:29.367
IT'S OKAY.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.537
<i> PARKER:</i>
<i> XAVIER DOESN'T HAVE</i>
<i> A LOT TO LOSE.</i>

19:32.539 --> 19:34.539
IT'S GONNA BE TRICKY

19:36.509 --> 19:38.242

19:38.244 --> 19:39.310
ED:
DR. OUELLETTE?

19:40.180 --> 19:42.230
HE JUST CALLED ME
ON THE PHONE.

19:42.231 --> 19:44.281
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS
MAN'S ACTIONS HERE TODAY.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.650
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.
SO LET ME CUT TO THE CHASE.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.886
COULD THE VACCINE HAVE
CAUSED XAVIER'S ILLNESS?

19:48.888 --> 19:51.322
THERE'S A PRESERVATIVE
THAT'S USED IN SOME VACCINES,

19:51.324 --> 19:52.640
SQUALENE,

19:52.641 --> 19:53.957
THAT'S RECENTLY
BEEN LINKED TO ALS.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.194
I KNOW R.D.A. HAS EXPERIMENTED
WITH SQUALENE IN THE PAST.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.663

NONE OF OUR SQUALENE VACCINES
EVER WENT TO MARKET.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.265
OKAY, LOOK,
HERE'S THE DEAL.

20:01.267 --> 20:03.501
XAVIER WANTS YOU TO GO
THROUGH R.D.A.'S DOCUMENTATION

20:03.503 --> 20:05.736
AND TO TELL HIM WHETHER OR NOT
THAT VACCINE IS SAFE.

20:05.738 --> 20:06.804
CAN YOU DO THAT?

20:06.806 --> 20:09.307

ABSOLUTELY.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.608

20:21.521 --> 20:23.955
R.D.A. GAVE HIM ACCESS
