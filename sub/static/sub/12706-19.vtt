WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.569
OZ:
 A werewolf in love.

00:02.602 --> 00:05.238
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:05.272 --> 00:08.242
Oz, don't you love me?

00:08.275 --> 00:11.478
OZ:
 The wolf is inside me
 all the time,

00:11.512 --> 00:13.147
and until I figure out
 what that means,

00:13.180 --> 00:14.714
I shouldn't be around you...

00:14.747 --> 00:17.150
or anybody.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.885
BUFFY:
 The Initiative created this
 thing and they can't stop it.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.821
But we will.
RILEY: The implant works.

00:20.853 --> 00:23.324
Hostile 17 can't harm any
 living creature in any way.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.824
SPIKE:
 I get this chip out,

00:24.858 --> 00:26.760
you and me are gonna
have a confrontation.

00:33.866 --> 00:37.338
I just like having
something that's... mine.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.439
I am, you know... yours.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.612
Do you like cats?

00:44.645 --> 00:46.079
More of a dog person myself.

00:46.113 --> 00:48.582
But I'm not, like,
death to all cats.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.183
Why?

00:50.218 --> 00:51.918
'Cause I was thinking
about getting one.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.253
Can you have one
in the dorms?

00:53.286 --> 00:55.956
No, but this would
be a sneaky cat.

00:55.988 --> 00:57.457
That would be cool.

00:57.490 --> 01:00.060
You mean it'd be
sort of like a familiar?

01:00.094 --> 01:03.796
Actually, I-I was thinking
it'd be sort of like a pet.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.099
You know, we could...
we could name her Trixie

01:06.134 --> 01:08.868
or Miss Kitty Fantastico
or something.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.704
And we could
make kitty go bonkers

01:10.737 --> 01:12.873
with string
and catnip and stuff?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.073
Absolutely.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.909
Fun. I'm in.

01:15.942 --> 01:17.978
So, you're not
allergic or anything?

01:18.010 --> 01:19.313
Nope.

01:19.347 --> 01:21.448
Good, 'cause I want my room

01:21.481 --> 01:23.817
to be Willow-friendly.

01:23.850 --> 01:26.052
Me, too.

01:26.085 --> 01:28.055
So, I'm excited about
the Scooby meeting.

01:28.087 --> 01:30.658
I think.
What's it about?

01:30.691 --> 01:31.992
I'm not sure.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.561
Probably just your
garden-variety disaster.

01:34.594 --> 01:35.996
BUFFY:
 Zippo.

01:36.028 --> 01:38.231
Patrol's been
totally uneventful.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.799
My kill count's way down.

01:39.832 --> 01:42.235
She means there's been
less bad-guy activity.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.237
We know what that
often indicates.

01:44.271 --> 01:47.341
Buffy doesn't make
her quota... bad slayer.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.143
Well, I wish it were
that innocuous,

01:49.176 --> 01:53.079
with Adam around,
I-I feel he's involved somehow.

01:53.112 --> 01:54.948
When things get slow
it's usually because

01:54.981 --> 01:57.617
there's some extra evil brewing.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.985
Except
the weird thing is

01:59.019 --> 02:01.120
we've been busy
at the Initiative.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.956
Our squads are pulling
a lot more captures.

02:02.989 --> 02:04.358
We've got demons
coming out our ears.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.793
That's a metaphor.

02:05.825 --> 02:07.027
I got it. Thanks.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.597
I'm over-helping,
aren't I?

02:09.628 --> 02:13.099
So, the activity has shifted,
but not stopped.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.169
It's fascinating.

02:15.203 --> 02:18.271
To an extremely
bored person, maybe.

02:18.306 --> 02:21.008
Well, that was
a thrilling hour.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.009
You know, I really
don't appreciate

02:22.042 --> 02:23.644
your snide remarks, Anya.

02:23.676 --> 02:25.212
(door opens)
Now, I have a great deal
of experience

02:25.246 --> 02:27.114
in these matters, and if
I say there is a matter

02:27.146 --> 02:29.149
of some import
brewing, I-I...

02:36.055 --> 02:37.390
Hey.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.497
(wolf howling)

02:43.531 --> 02:46.033
*

03:35.048 --> 03:36.783
Oz.

03:38.918 --> 03:40.621
Oz.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.824
WILLOW:
Wh... When did you get back?

03:46.493 --> 03:48.127
Pretty much now.

03:50.062 --> 03:51.465
Oz, man.

03:51.498 --> 03:52.900
Hate to sound
grandma, but...

03:52.932 --> 03:55.936
you don't call.
You don't write.

03:55.968 --> 03:58.372
Yeah. Sorry.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.907
So, are you here here,
or are you just

04:00.941 --> 04:02.241
passing through?

04:02.276 --> 04:04.312
GILES:
Um, let's not uh,
bombard the poor chap

04:04.344 --> 04:06.413
with, uh,
questions right off.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.882
Uh, can I get you something?
A tea, perhaps?

04:08.915 --> 04:10.751
I'll pass.

04:10.783 --> 04:11.852
Thanks.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.057
Look, I'm going to Devon's

04:17.089 --> 04:19.225
to see if he's got
a place I can crash,

04:19.259 --> 04:22.495
but I was hoping
that we could talk.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.497
Later.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.367
Tonight.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.670
I guess so.

04:32.271 --> 04:34.240
I'll come by your place?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.944
Okay.

04:39.379 --> 04:42.081
It's great to see
you guys again.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.216
Really.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.124
Everyone's uncomfortable now.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.096
You okay?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.430
I...

04:57.465 --> 04:59.800
I just... um, I realized

04:59.832 --> 05:02.870
I-I'm late for study group.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.437
Tara, wait.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.838
No, no, it's... i-it's okay.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.007
You... y-you should be
with your friends,

05:08.040 --> 05:11.644
and... and I should go.

05:11.678 --> 05:13.680
But...

05:24.925 --> 05:27.226
So, um, I was
missing something

05:27.259 --> 05:29.028
this afternoon, wasn't I?

05:29.062 --> 05:30.531
I mean, breakups are tough,

05:30.564 --> 05:32.231
but when Oz walked in,

05:32.264 --> 05:35.002
it seemed like emotions
were running extra high.

05:35.034 --> 05:37.504
Oz and Willow
had a rough breakup.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.238
(growling)
Hold that thought.

05:39.271 --> 05:41.608
(grunting)

05:49.348 --> 05:51.819
Man, that was record time.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.987
It's no fun when
they're that easy.

05:54.021 --> 05:57.057
Speak for yourself.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.526
Base, this is Agent Finn.
We have an HST down.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.661
Please send a retrieval team
to sector 72.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.196
BASE AGENT:
We're swamped down here, Finn.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.798
We'll get to it
as soon as we can.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.603
So, I was just about to say
something fascinating.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.170
Oz and Willow.

06:11.204 --> 06:15.041
Right.
They had a rough breakup.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.446
Some stuff came up,

06:18.478 --> 06:20.947
and Oz pretty much
bailed overnight.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.850
It left Will really devastated.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.918
I remember.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.620
The thing is, before that,
they were doing great.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.723
I mean, she was totally dealing
with Oz being a werewolf.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.625
It wasn't even...
Whoa. Back up, there.

06:31.658 --> 06:35.562
Oz is a werewolf and
Willow was dating him?

06:35.596 --> 06:37.430
Yes.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.365
Hence the high emotions.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.033
Man, you're-you're kidding me.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.769
Got to say I'm surprised.

06:42.802 --> 06:45.038
I didn't think Willow
was that kind of girl.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.206
What kind of girl?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.576
Into dangerous guys.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.478
She seems smarter
than that.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.745
Oz is not dangerous.

06:52.779 --> 06:54.615
Something happened to him
that wasn't his fault.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.550
God, I never knew
you were such a bigot.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.952
Whoa. Hey, how did
we get to bigot?

06:59.987 --> 07:01.822
I'm just saying it's a little
weird to date someone

07:01.855 --> 07:03.456
who tries to eat
you once a month.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.559
Yeah, well,
love isn't logical, Riley.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.827
It's not like you can be
Mr. Joe Sensible

07:07.860 --> 07:09.963
about it all the time.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.231
God knows I haven't been.

07:12.264 --> 07:14.401
I'm not talking about you.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.170
How about we don't
talk about this at all?

07:17.204 --> 07:18.771
Okay? Let's just patrol.

07:29.348 --> 07:30.817
Hey.

07:32.151 --> 07:33.452
Hey.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.793
So...

07:39.826 --> 07:42.829
y-you want to come inside?

07:44.997 --> 07:47.768
Actually, I want you
to come outside.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.802
I want to show you
something.

07:59.245 --> 08:00.413
Oz...

08:03.483 --> 08:06.687
this is all so weird.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.389
I-I feel like...

08:09.422 --> 08:10.723
this isn't really happening,

08:10.757 --> 08:14.360
like it's a dream
or something.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.396
It's real.

08:16.428 --> 08:17.865
Look up.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.632
What?

08:19.667 --> 08:21.401
Look at the sky.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.406
I guess you stopped
keeping track of them

08:26.439 --> 08:27.641
after I left.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.042
Full moon.

08:30.242 --> 08:31.377
Full moon.

08:33.245 --> 08:35.182
Full moon, but-but how?

08:35.215 --> 08:37.517
I mean, you did it.

08:37.551 --> 08:38.818
H-How did you do it?

08:38.851 --> 08:40.220
Where did you go?

08:40.253 --> 08:41.822
That's a long story.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.692
My God, Oz.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.570
This is...

08:56.604 --> 08:58.672
I mean...

08:58.706 --> 09:01.541
It's wonderful for you.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.610
I talked to Xander,

09:03.644 --> 09:06.779
and he said you didn't
have a new guy.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.783
No.

09:09.817 --> 09:12.119
No new guy.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.894
I know what I
put you through,

09:21.928 --> 09:24.096
and I'm not gonna push.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.034
But I am...

09:28.067 --> 09:30.403
a different person

09:30.437 --> 09:32.105
than when I left.

09:32.139 --> 09:35.174
And I can be
what you need now.

09:37.677 --> 09:40.312
That's what I want.

09:40.346 --> 09:41.981
That's why I'm here.

09:46.452 --> 09:48.455
AGENT (on comms):
Sector 27, we're all clear.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.292
(rustling)

09:52.325 --> 09:53.592
Sir.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.667
(snarling)

10:02.802 --> 10:04.037
(grunting)

10:06.173 --> 10:07.374
Aah!

10:11.477 --> 10:13.013
(screams)

10:15.381 --> 10:16.683
(snarling)

10:24.456 --> 10:26.192
I love this.

10:26.225 --> 10:29.863
A woman in Tibet traded it
to me for the Radiohead record.

10:29.897 --> 10:33.667
Got a lot of mileage
out of the barter system.

10:33.701 --> 10:36.369
So, Tibet was your favorite?

10:36.403 --> 10:39.605
Well, it's where
I stayed the longest.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.808
This warlock in Romania
sent me to the monks there

10:41.841 --> 10:44.311
to learn some
meditation techniques.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.544
Very intense.

10:45.577 --> 10:48.347
All about keeping
your inner cool.

10:48.380 --> 10:51.584
Good, 'cause you were
such a spaz before.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.288
So that's it?

10:55.322 --> 10:58.826
You keep your cool,
and no more wolfie?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.559
No, there's more.

11:00.592 --> 11:02.328
I take some herbs and stuff.

11:02.361 --> 11:03.864
Some chanting.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.231
Couple of charms.

11:05.264 --> 11:08.235
It's incredible.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.636
You've been all
around the world.

11:10.669 --> 11:13.505
You've had this complete

11:13.539 --> 11:16.809
mind-body transformation.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.678
I've just been here,

11:19.712 --> 11:21.581
same old Sunnydale.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.317
Doesn't mean you haven't
gone through a lot.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.086
It's true.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.822
Some of it, you know,

11:28.855 --> 11:31.490
was me telling
myself I hated you

11:31.524 --> 11:33.860
and cursing your name.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.662
Not literally.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.764
Well, thanks for that.

11:38.731 --> 11:40.600
And...

11:40.633 --> 11:41.835
I don't know,

11:41.869 --> 11:44.370
I... I think
I'm getting better

11:44.403 --> 11:46.639
at my spells and stuff.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.014
It's so light out.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.383
Yeah, we talked all night.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.384
Well, I believe
a manly-sized breakfast

11:58.418 --> 12:00.788
is in order, don't you?

12:00.821 --> 12:02.422
Or we could just...

12:05.457 --> 12:07.626
sleep a little while.

12:09.495 --> 12:10.629
Whatever you want.

12:13.633 --> 12:16.937
I'll have the less-confusing
waffles right now.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.272
Breakfast it is.

12:20.639 --> 12:22.741
Let me just,
uh, freshen up.

12:31.283 --> 12:33.019
(knocking)

12:40.293 --> 12:42.796
Oh, sorry.
I-I'll come back.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.663
Are you looking for Willow?

12:44.697 --> 12:46.633
She's just in the bathroom
down the hall.
No, no, no.

12:46.665 --> 12:48.735
No, it's... it's okay.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.736
I saw you at Giles' yesterday.

12:50.769 --> 12:54.673
Yeah. Sometimes
Willow takes me with her

12:54.706 --> 12:56.576
to the S-Scoobies.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.111
You sure you don't
want to come in?

13:18.899 --> 13:20.200
What?

13:20.232 --> 13:21.600
Your friend came by.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.102
The blonde girl?

13:23.135 --> 13:24.471
But she wouldn't stay.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.375
So what do you think?

13:28.408 --> 13:31.378
Where do you
want to go?

13:31.411 --> 13:32.412
(alarm beeps)

13:42.754 --> 13:44.456
Morning.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.424
Morning.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.351
Those, like, regulation?

14:12.384 --> 14:14.653
You have to do
those every morning?

14:14.687 --> 14:16.155
No.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.390
Just a good way
to start the day.

14:18.424 --> 14:21.494
Great. Then you can have your
perfectly balanced breakfast,

14:21.528 --> 14:23.296
and then you can
call your mother.

14:24.764 --> 14:27.500
Okay. I've been up
less than a minute

14:27.533 --> 14:30.102
and somehow I've managed
to piss you off.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.272
I should go home.

14:32.304 --> 14:34.841
No.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.943
Come on.

14:36.976 --> 14:40.846
Is it that whole thing
about Willow last night?

14:40.879 --> 14:42.950
Look... I only
said what I said

14:42.982 --> 14:44.551
because I'm concerned.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.286
I don't want to
see her get hurt.

14:46.318 --> 14:49.255
You sounded like Mr. Initiative.

14:49.288 --> 14:51.423
Demons bad. People good.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.125
Something wrong
with that theorem?

14:54.461 --> 14:56.729
There's different degrees of...

14:56.763 --> 14:58.264
Evil?

15:00.399 --> 15:02.235
It's just different

15:02.269 --> 15:05.772
with different demons.

15:05.804 --> 15:07.941
There are creatures--

15:07.975 --> 15:10.943
vampires, for example,

15:10.977 --> 15:13.779
that aren't evil at all.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.581
Name one.

15:15.615 --> 15:16.816
(door opens)

15:16.849 --> 15:20.720
Ri, we need you downstairs.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.054
Beta team got hit.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.623
Bad?

15:23.655 --> 15:25.491
We lost Willis.

15:25.524 --> 15:26.826
Graham?

15:26.859 --> 15:27.826
He's walking.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.928
We're going on a hunt.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.668
What kind of demon was it?

15:35.701 --> 15:38.837
Does it matter?

15:40.639 --> 15:42.774
(door closes)

15:44.777 --> 15:46.013
(door opens)

15:48.648 --> 15:50.417
Hey.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.951
Hey.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.552
You okay?

15:54.854 --> 15:57.524
Yeah, I just...

15:57.557 --> 15:59.625
I don't want to talk about it.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.660
I want to hear about
you and Oz.

16:01.693 --> 16:03.363
You saw him, right?

16:05.999 --> 16:07.833
I was with him
all night.

16:07.866 --> 16:09.269
All night?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.138
Oh, my God.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.705
Wait.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.642
Last night was
a wolf moon, right?

16:15.674 --> 16:17.943
Yup.
Either you're
about to tell me

16:17.976 --> 16:19.645
something
incredibly kinky, or...

16:19.678 --> 16:21.780
No kink.

16:21.813 --> 16:24.384
He didn't change, Buffy.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.952
He said he was gonna
find a cure and he did.

16:26.985 --> 16:28.620
In Tibet.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.023
Oh, my God.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.890
I can't believe it.

16:31.923 --> 16:34.527
Okay, I'm all with
the woo-hoo here,

16:34.561 --> 16:36.163
and you're not.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.965
No, there's "woo"
and-and "hoo,"

16:38.998 --> 16:41.533
but there's "uh-oh"

16:41.567 --> 16:43.635
and "why now"?

16:43.669 --> 16:45.471
And...

16:45.504 --> 16:48.040
it's complicated.

16:48.075 --> 16:51.177
Why complicated?

16:55.248 --> 16:57.750
It's complicated...

16:57.783 --> 17:00.352
because of Tara.

17:00.386 --> 17:03.855
You mean Tara has a crush on Oz?

17:03.889 --> 17:05.892
No, you...

17:07.894 --> 17:09.194
Oh.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.202
Oh.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.404
Um...

17:18.438 --> 17:21.540
Well... that's great.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.410
You know, I mean,
I think-I think Tara's

17:23.442 --> 17:26.045
a really great girl, Will.

17:26.078 --> 17:28.881
She is. And...

17:28.914 --> 17:31.750
there's something between us.

17:31.784 --> 17:35.221
It wasn't something
I was looking for.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.226
It's just powerful.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.228
And it's totally different

17:41.260 --> 17:44.530
from what Oz and I have.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.098
Well, there you go.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.767
I mean, you know,
you have to...

17:47.799 --> 17:49.969
you have to follow
your heart, Will.

17:50.001 --> 17:52.338
And that's
what's important, Will.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.776
Why do you keep saying
my name like that?

17:56.808 --> 17:59.445
Like what, Will?

18:01.748 --> 18:04.083
Are you freaked?

18:04.116 --> 18:05.285
What?

18:05.317 --> 18:07.319
No, Will, d...

18:09.122 --> 18:10.323
No.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.659
No, absolutely no

18:12.692 --> 18:14.760
to that question.

18:16.962 --> 18:18.964
I'm glad you told me.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.001
What did you say to Oz?

18:23.035 --> 18:25.003
I was gonna tell him.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.773
But then we
started hanging out,

18:27.807 --> 18:30.176
and I could just feel

18:30.210 --> 18:32.479
everything coming back.

18:34.980 --> 18:38.351
He's Oz, you know?

18:38.384 --> 18:41.019
Yeah, I know.

18:41.052 --> 18:44.856
I don't want to hurt
anyone, Buffy.

18:44.891 --> 18:48.627
No matter what,
somebody's gonna get hurt.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.697
And the important thing is

18:50.730 --> 18:52.932
you just have to be honest,

18:52.964 --> 18:55.134
or it's gonna be a lot worse.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.340
(heavy footsteps approaching)

19:10.182 --> 19:13.152
From the sound
of those massive mud flaps,

19:13.185 --> 19:15.321
I'd peg you as a demon,

19:15.355 --> 19:17.890
which means you're in
for a world of...

19:19.759 --> 19:21.861
pain.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.497
Spike, I want you
to come with me.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.398
Do you?

19:26.432 --> 19:27.834
Well, let's go, then.

19:29.868 --> 19:31.069
Ow.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.672
Come.

19:32.704 --> 19:34.840
You're going to help me
with my problem.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.209
Why is that, exactly?

19:36.242 --> 19:39.346
I'm going to help you
with yours.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.785
Hi.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.721
Hi.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.925
I can only stay
for a minute.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.528
I have class.

19:55.561 --> 19:59.499
Me, too.
I-I have class, too.

19:59.531 --> 20:03.001
I just want you to know
that what you saw

20:03.035 --> 20:05.271
this morning,
it wasn't...

20:05.305 --> 20:06.705
No, it's okay.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.740
I-I always knew
that if he came back...

20:08.775 --> 20:10.376
We were just talking.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.178
Nothing happened.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.613
Oh.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.250
Really?

20:18.285 --> 20:22.121
But you know,
it was intense,

20:22.153 --> 20:24.790
just talking.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.893
We have a lot to talk about.

20:28.994 --> 20:32.163
I kind of feel like
my head's gonna explode.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.903
Whatever,
you know, happens,

20:37.936 --> 20:39.939
I'll still be here.

20:39.971 --> 20:42.375
I'll still be your friend.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.943
Of course we'll be friends.

20:44.977 --> 20:48.079
That's not even a question.

20:48.114 --> 20:51.617
But I'm saying I know
what Oz means to you.

20:53.619 --> 20:57.123
How can you
when I'm not even sure?

20:57.155 --> 20:59.157
I mean,

20:59.191 --> 21:01.361
I know what he meant to me.

21:04.696 --> 21:08.000
But he left, and...

21:08.034 --> 21:09.501
everything changed.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.903
I changed, and...

21:11.938 --> 21:14.140
then we...

21:14.173 --> 21:16.476
What?

21:16.509 --> 21:18.678
I don't know. I just...

21:18.711 --> 21:22.213
life was starting
to get so good again, and...

21:24.951 --> 21:28.855
You're a big part of that.

21:28.887 --> 21:31.657
And here comes the thing

21:31.691 --> 21:33.960
I wanted most of all, and...

21:33.992 --> 21:36.295
I don't know
what to do.

21:36.328 --> 21:37.997
I... I want to know,

21:38.029 --> 21:40.833
but I don't.

21:43.536 --> 21:46.204
Do what makes you

21:46.238 --> 21:47.973
hap-happy.

22:10.261 --> 22:11.631
(sniffs)

22:11.663 --> 22:14.567
Willow.

22:14.601 --> 22:16.536
Hey.

22:16.568 --> 22:17.903
I thought I sm...

22:17.936 --> 22:20.839
uh, heard Willow.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.509
Hey.

22:24.943 --> 22:26.413
You're, um,

22:26.445 --> 22:29.715
you're coming back
to school here, huh?

22:29.749 --> 22:33.420
Pretty much.
Feeling oddly motivated.

22:33.452 --> 22:35.922
That's, um,

22:35.954 --> 22:38.891
that's great.
I mean, that's...

22:38.924 --> 22:41.259
that's great
for you and Willow, right?

22:41.292 --> 22:42.862
I hope so.

22:42.894 --> 22:45.330
Good. That's... Because...

22:45.364 --> 22:46.332
Is that her sweater?

22:46.365 --> 22:48.200
I just-I just hope

22:48.233 --> 22:51.938
that you guys'll be very happy.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.807
You smell like her.

22:57.076 --> 23:00.278
She's all over you.
Do you know that?

23:00.311 --> 23:01.548
I can't.

23:01.580 --> 23:04.550
I... I can't
talk about this.

23:04.584 --> 23:06.719
But there's something
to talk about?

23:09.121 --> 23:11.257
Are you two involved?

23:11.289 --> 23:13.058
I have-I have... I have to go.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.193
Because she never said
anything to me like that,

23:15.227 --> 23:17.363
and we talked all night,
and she never...

23:17.395 --> 23:18.897
No, stop!

23:20.932 --> 23:23.035
Is she in love with you?

23:23.068 --> 23:25.003
Tell me-- is she...

23:28.406 --> 23:29.608
(cracking)

23:29.642 --> 23:30.777
(mouths)

23:34.413 --> 23:36.414
Run.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.656
(growling)

24:01.473 --> 24:02.541
(screams)

24:09.214 --> 24:11.217
(footsteps approaching)

24:14.487 --> 24:15.521
Are you okay?
Wh-What's going on?

24:15.555 --> 24:17.189
We'll take it from here.

24:17.222 --> 24:18.790
This thing looks like
it may be one of the demons

24:18.825 --> 24:20.692
that took out Graham's guys
the other night.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.761
RILEY:
So we'll take it back
and make an ID.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.195
If it is, we'll put him down.

24:24.230 --> 24:25.531
You don't understand.
That's a...

24:25.565 --> 24:27.534
Listen, we know
what we're doing.

24:27.567 --> 24:28.800
You're in shock.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.569
But...
FORREST: We'll handle it.

24:32.003 --> 24:33.038
No.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.440
SPIKE:
 Well...

24:34.472 --> 24:36.375
that sounds like a lot of fun.

24:36.407 --> 24:38.009
You see my problem,
though.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.145
Total annihilation
of the humans doesn't help me.

24:40.179 --> 24:42.882
I'll be needing
heavy casualties on both sides.

24:42.914 --> 24:44.450
I get that.

24:44.482 --> 24:46.552
I'm still not sure
how the slayer fits in.

24:46.586 --> 24:50.355
The humans need a leader,
a champion.

24:50.388 --> 24:52.625
The slayer can do that.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.393
Yeah.

24:54.425 --> 24:55.961
The thing about the slayer is

24:55.994 --> 24:57.564
she is a whiny little thing,

24:57.596 --> 24:59.030
but when it comes
to the fighting,

24:59.065 --> 25:01.634
she does have a slight
tendency to win.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.170
Then I guess
you should be on her side.

25:04.202 --> 25:06.471
(chuckles)

25:06.505 --> 25:08.473
This all goes down,

25:08.507 --> 25:10.742
the chip comes out, yeah?

25:10.777 --> 25:12.478
No tricks?

25:12.510 --> 25:13.913
Scout's honor.

25:13.945 --> 25:16.648
You were a Boy Scout?

25:16.682 --> 25:18.917
Parts of me.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.261
What's up? You okay?

25:30.296 --> 25:31.597
Oz.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.732
We were talking, and he changed

25:33.766 --> 25:35.000
right in front of me.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.903
What? It's daylight.

25:36.935 --> 25:38.570
I know, but it happened.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.707
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

25:40.740 --> 25:42.909
I'm fine.
Riley and the commando guys--

25:42.942 --> 25:45.577
they stopped him.
But they don't know it's Oz.

25:45.612 --> 25:48.114
I tried to tell them,
but they took him away.

25:48.146 --> 25:49.682
When, just now?

25:49.715 --> 25:51.217
I think they might hurt him.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.118
I-I have to go.
I have to find Buffy.

25:53.152 --> 25:54.420
I know.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.392
Tara said they took him
right before she found me.

26:00.425 --> 26:02.094
So that's
good, right?

26:02.127 --> 26:03.561
I mean, they probably
haven't had time

26:03.596 --> 26:05.564
to eviscerate
him yet.
(dialing)

26:05.597 --> 26:08.099
An, you can help by
making this a quiet time.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.636
Once again we're faced with
the fairly daunting prospect

26:10.670 --> 26:12.704
of having to infiltrate
the Initiative.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.941
It'd be great if we knew someone
dating a man on the inside--

26:14.973 --> 26:16.407
someone
with connections.

26:16.442 --> 26:17.876
Oh, wait.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.145
He's still not
answering his pages.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.980
I left him
another message.

26:22.013 --> 26:24.316
So what do we do?
Well, we need to move fast,

26:24.349 --> 26:26.384
so we make a plan without Riley.

26:26.417 --> 26:29.221
And hope he calls.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.257
(growling)

26:33.291 --> 26:35.294
(indistinct announcement on PA)

26:43.769 --> 26:45.570
What's the word, doc?

26:45.604 --> 26:46.972
Is this the animal
that took apart our men?

26:47.006 --> 26:48.339
We don't know yet, soldier.

26:48.374 --> 26:49.642
What's the holdup?
I thought Graham

26:49.675 --> 26:50.910
gave you a full description.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.478
The holdup
is that he described

26:52.510 --> 26:54.279
characteristics
present in over 40

26:54.313 --> 26:56.115
known varieties of demon,

26:56.147 --> 26:59.151
so we're cross-checking
DNA evidence-- hair, fibers.

26:59.184 --> 27:01.854
And how long's
that gonna take?

27:01.887 --> 27:03.189
I have no idea.

27:03.221 --> 27:05.090
I don't need a bunch of tests

27:05.124 --> 27:06.726
to know that
this thing's a killer.
(gun cocks)

27:22.574 --> 27:24.476
Hey, he's coming to. Oz...

27:24.509 --> 27:25.944
He won't be able to
talk for a while.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.113
We gave him Haldol
to keep him quiet.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.480
Why? He's not a threat now.

27:28.513 --> 27:29.981
I allowed you to stay as long as

27:30.016 --> 27:31.549
you let us do our work,
Agent Finn.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.451
Only Colonel McNamara
can place a cease order

27:33.484 --> 27:35.688
on medical testing,
and he's told us to proceed.

27:35.721 --> 27:37.556
I always suspected
that stuff

27:37.588 --> 27:39.726
about werewolf
transformations being based

27:39.759 --> 27:42.161
on a lunar cycle
was campfire talk.

27:42.193 --> 27:43.662
(groans)

27:45.263 --> 27:46.632
Oh, hey, that's enough.
Come on, the guy's

27:46.664 --> 27:48.634
a student, I know him.
Take him out.

27:48.666 --> 27:50.469
Yes, sir.

27:50.501 --> 27:51.502
Let's go.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.680
(yells)

28:01.713 --> 28:04.083
(growls)

28:05.683 --> 28:07.653
See that?
Transformation

28:07.685 --> 28:10.655
related to negative
stimulation.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.258
Something's wrong.

28:12.290 --> 28:14.492
Riley usually returns
my phone calls by now.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.327
We can't wait much longer.

28:16.362 --> 28:17.930
I know.

28:17.963 --> 28:20.165
Okay. Xander, you and I
are gonna go in.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.200
We've done it
before.

28:21.232 --> 28:22.667
I'm going with you.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.670
No. Look, it's
too dangerous, Will.

28:24.702 --> 28:26.038
Besides, I need
you to help Giles

28:26.071 --> 28:27.605
hack into the city's
electrical grid.

28:27.638 --> 28:29.275
We've got to try to power down
the Initiative.

28:29.307 --> 28:31.042
Giles can do it without me.

28:31.076 --> 28:32.677
I can give him
all the instructions.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.947
I can show him
exactly what to do.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.583
Of course.
I-I can't
just sit here.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.855
Okay.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.924
Okay, you can back us up.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.059
Now, the only way I know
into the Initiative

28:48.094 --> 28:49.461
is through the elevator
in the Lowell House,

28:49.494 --> 28:50.930
but my clearance
is long gone.

28:50.962 --> 28:52.865
So we grab a guy,
make him take us.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.634
SPIKE:
Or you could just
use the back way.

28:55.666 --> 28:57.068
Hell of a lot less bother.

28:57.103 --> 28:58.403
How did you get in?

28:58.436 --> 29:00.638
SPIKE:
The door was unlocked.

29:00.672 --> 29:02.374
You might want to
watch that, Rupert.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.242
Someone dangerous could get in.

29:04.276 --> 29:07.479
Or someone formerly dangerous
and currently annoying.

29:07.512 --> 29:11.282
Now, now. None of that...

29:11.317 --> 29:14.720
or I won't help you
get Red's mongrel back.

29:14.752 --> 29:17.123
Bad news travels fast
with us demons.

29:17.155 --> 29:20.125
We all like a good laugh.

29:20.159 --> 29:21.794
Short of cash, Spike?

29:21.827 --> 29:24.762
I happen to be seeking
monetary gratification, yeah.

29:24.797 --> 29:26.432
But I also get a kick

29:26.464 --> 29:28.733
out of jacking up
those army ginks myself.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.737
I know how to find the big
guy who can take you to Oz.

29:31.769 --> 29:33.572
Uh-huh.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.407
So what's the going rate
on a wild-goose chase, Spike?

29:36.442 --> 29:39.345
Fine.
If you're not interested.

29:39.377 --> 29:42.280
But I was stuck
in that hole, remember?

29:42.314 --> 29:44.516
And I've heard things from
other guys who've gotten out.

29:44.549 --> 29:47.353
I can get you in.
No alarms, no cameras...

29:48.554 --> 29:49.955
no waiting.

29:52.357 --> 29:53.859
(soft growling)

30:00.665 --> 30:02.701
(door opens)

30:02.733 --> 30:05.336
(roaring, growling)

30:13.244 --> 30:15.247
Oz.

30:16.347 --> 30:18.384
Put these on, man.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.251
Come on.

30:37.269 --> 30:38.769
End of the line.

30:59.057 --> 31:01.759
At ease.

31:01.792 --> 31:03.362
Permission to speak, Colonel.

31:03.394 --> 31:05.497
Denied.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.398
Being new around here, Finn,
I had a look

31:07.432 --> 31:09.734
at your record
and Professor Walsh's notes.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.869
Until recently, you were
an exemplary soldier

31:11.903 --> 31:14.272
headed straight for the top.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.375
Then you meet
this girl, this...

31:16.407 --> 31:18.009
slayer, and suddenly

31:18.044 --> 31:20.612
you begin to exhibit
signs of disloyalty.

31:20.645 --> 31:22.614
You abuse your command.

31:24.482 --> 31:28.086
But tonight--

31:28.119 --> 31:30.888
to release a lethal HST
back into the population...

31:30.923 --> 31:32.124
Sir, the prisoner...

31:32.157 --> 31:34.292
You will speak
when I tell you to.

31:36.795 --> 31:39.397
Tomorrow I am going
to institute a court-martial

31:39.431 --> 31:41.933
to investigate the extent of
your involvement with the slayer

31:41.968 --> 31:44.569
and her band of freaks.

31:46.738 --> 31:50.041
They're anarchists, Finn.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.243
Too backwards
for the real world.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.747
You help us take them down,
and you just might

31:55.780 --> 31:57.782
save your military career.

31:57.816 --> 32:01.153
Otherwise you'll go to your
grave labeled a traitor.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.928
No woman's
worth that.

32:12.763 --> 32:14.465
I mentioned how much
I'm gonna kill you

32:14.500 --> 32:16.301
if this is a scam, right?

32:16.335 --> 32:18.636
Look, would I wear this if
I wasn't on the up and up?

32:18.670 --> 32:20.638
You do sort of look like
an evil olive.

32:20.672 --> 32:23.174
Guys, check it out.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.825
(lock clicks)

32:41.960 --> 32:43.929
For a nasty town like Sunnydale,

32:43.961 --> 32:45.998
nobody seems
to mind their locks.

32:46.031 --> 32:48.799
You first.

32:57.742 --> 32:59.744
(beeping)

33:04.182 --> 33:05.683
(typing)

33:06.984 --> 33:10.888
Try typing in... XH4J7

33:10.922 --> 33:12.990
for the emergency
shutdown command.

33:13.025 --> 33:15.060
That covers
the entire electrical grid

33:15.094 --> 33:17.962
for the university
and outlying area.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.998
(typing)

33:34.279 --> 33:36.481
Slap my hand now.
(chuckles)

33:36.515 --> 33:38.584
Beg your pardon?

33:38.616 --> 33:40.885
In celebration.

33:40.919 --> 33:42.488
Oh.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.689
Yes.

33:43.721 --> 33:45.022
Ow.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.596
Hey.

33:50.628 --> 33:52.631
You know who I am?

33:55.433 --> 33:57.001
Yeah.
Then you know
I'm pretty good

33:57.035 --> 34:00.071
with this thing.
Take us to him.

34:00.105 --> 34:02.540
Finn stays in the brig.

34:02.574 --> 34:05.743
Helping an HST escape is
a court-martial offense.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.445
You're only gonna
make matters worse.

34:07.479 --> 34:09.148
Riley tried to help Oz escape?

34:10.648 --> 34:13.219
That's who you came for.

34:13.251 --> 34:14.452
The wolf.

34:14.485 --> 34:16.922
Guess we're two for one.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.458
Get dressed.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.764
Hey, you dropped your...

34:36.474 --> 34:37.943
How'd you get in?

34:37.976 --> 34:40.311
Talk later.
Stealthy escape now.

34:40.346 --> 34:41.579
Buffy.

34:41.612 --> 34:44.583
I leave now,
I can't ever come back.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.655
I just wanted
to hear that out loud.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.094
SOLDIER:
Hold it.

35:04.135 --> 35:05.836
Stay back

35:05.871 --> 35:08.440
or I'll pull a William Burroughs
on your leader here.

35:10.641 --> 35:13.512
You'll bore him to death
with free prose?

35:14.945 --> 35:17.248
Was I the only one awake
in English that day?

35:17.282 --> 35:19.485
I'll kill him.

35:19.518 --> 35:21.519
Get him out.

35:31.297 --> 35:32.463
Oz...
Willow, get back.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.711
Let's go.

36:30.856 --> 36:33.525
You're a dead man, Finn.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.364
No, sir.

36:39.697 --> 36:41.166
I'm an anarchist.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.201
(grunts)

36:49.641 --> 36:51.677
I hope everybody
else is okay.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.911
It was better to
split up, right?

36:53.945 --> 36:57.349
I mean, we're just too
findable in a big clump.

36:57.382 --> 36:58.949
It was better.

36:58.983 --> 37:01.018
Besides, I think
it's mostly me

37:01.052 --> 37:02.987
the Initiative wants now.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.193
Probably.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.362
So what should we do?

37:10.396 --> 37:13.231
Oh, we'll be safe
for tonight at least.

37:13.264 --> 37:15.567
The campus is still
blacked out, so

37:15.601 --> 37:17.802
that ought to slow
the Initiative down.

37:17.835 --> 37:21.306
I'll figure out
my next move tomorrow.

37:24.909 --> 37:27.778
Quite a day, huh?

37:30.349 --> 37:33.251
You woke up to a big
bowl of Wheaties.

37:33.284 --> 37:35.487
Now you're a fugitive.

37:37.422 --> 37:38.757
I don't know.

37:38.789 --> 37:41.626
I'm sorry it ended that way,

37:41.659 --> 37:43.961
but I am glad it's done.

37:43.994 --> 37:45.463
I'm glad I know where I stand.

37:45.496 --> 37:46.931
Finally.

37:49.967 --> 37:51.302
I was wrong about Oz.

37:51.336 --> 37:53.038
I was being a bigot.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.940
No, you weren't.

37:55.974 --> 37:58.143
You were thrown.

37:58.175 --> 38:01.612
You found out
that Willow was in...

38:01.646 --> 38:03.681
kind of an unconventional
relationship,

38:03.715 --> 38:06.985
and it gave you
a momentary wiggins.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.987
It happens.

38:09.019 --> 38:10.521
Still...

38:10.556 --> 38:12.123
I was in a totally
black-and-white space,

38:12.157 --> 38:15.793
people versus monsters,
and it ain't like that.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.829
Especially
when it comes to love.

38:28.407 --> 38:32.010
I have to tell you
some stuff.

38:32.043 --> 38:35.280
About my past.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.983
And it's not all stuff
that you're gonna like.

38:42.853 --> 38:44.889
You can tell me anything.

38:47.858 --> 38:49.527
I think so.

38:51.195 --> 38:54.164
I think I can.

38:58.436 --> 39:01.672
This thing looks pretty good

39:01.706 --> 39:05.010
considering
you drove it overseas.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.844
Well, it broke down
outside of Mexico,

39:06.878 --> 39:10.047
and I traded my bass to
have it fixed and garaged.

39:15.286 --> 39:17.288
I shouldn't have
come back now.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.527
I just thought
I'd changed.

39:23.795 --> 39:26.364
You have changed.

39:26.398 --> 39:29.668
You stopped the wolf
from coming out. I saw it.

39:29.701 --> 39:32.103
But I couldn't look at you.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.840
I mean, it turns out...

39:35.873 --> 39:39.210
the one thing that
brings it out of me is you.

39:40.945 --> 39:43.715
Which falls under the heading
of ironic in my book.

39:45.315 --> 39:47.117
It was my fault.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.153
I upset you.

39:52.389 --> 39:54.960
Well, so we're safe then,

39:54.992 --> 39:57.628
'cause you'll
never do that again.

40:02.266 --> 40:05.436
But you're happy?

40:05.471 --> 40:09.239
I am.

40:09.273 --> 40:11.108
I can't explain it.

40:11.141 --> 40:14.244
It may be safer
for both of us if you don't.

40:20.184 --> 40:22.086
I missed you, Oz.

40:24.523 --> 40:28.425
I wrote you so many letters.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.661
But I didn't have any place

40:30.695 --> 40:33.431
to send them, you know?

40:37.503 --> 40:39.670
I couldn't live like that.

40:41.306 --> 40:44.009
It was stupid to think
that you'd just be...

40:44.041 --> 40:46.777
waiting.

40:46.811 --> 40:49.313
I was waiting.

40:51.315 --> 40:53.585
I feel like some part of me

40:53.619 --> 40:57.021
will always be waiting for you.

40:57.054 --> 40:59.858
Like, if I'm old
and blue-haired

40:59.891 --> 41:02.193
and I turn the corner
in Istanbul,

41:02.226 --> 41:05.630
and there you are,
I won't be surprised.

41:07.197 --> 41:10.135
Because...

41:10.168 --> 41:13.003
you're with me, you know?

41:13.572 --> 41:15.574
I know.

41:19.244 --> 41:22.213
But now is not
that time, I guess.

41:26.717 --> 41:28.253
No.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.027
What are you gonna do?

41:37.427 --> 41:39.864
I think I better take off.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.769
When?

41:47.237 --> 41:49.239
Pretty much now.

42:07.726 --> 42:09.728
*

42:29.246 --> 42:30.882
(knocking)

42:42.159 --> 42:44.195
No candles?

42:44.228 --> 42:47.032
Well, I brought one.

42:47.065 --> 42:49.467
It's extra flamey.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.449
Tara, I have to tell you...

43:04.481 --> 43:06.384
No, I... I understand.

43:06.416 --> 43:08.619
You have to be with

43:08.653 --> 43:10.655
the person you l-love.

43:13.958 --> 43:15.960
I am.

43:19.864 --> 43:21.800
You mean...

43:21.833 --> 43:24.501
I mean.

43:24.534 --> 43:26.637
Okay?

43:26.672 --> 43:29.574
Oh, yes.

43:29.606 --> 43:32.811
I feel horrible about
everything I put you through,

43:32.844 --> 43:36.014
a-and I'm gonna
make it up to you.

43:36.047 --> 43:38.048
Starting right now.

43:41.119 --> 43:42.619
Right now?

44:24.494 --> 44:26.898
Grr. Argh.
