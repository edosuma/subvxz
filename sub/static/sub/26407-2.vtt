WEBVTT

00:05.353 --> 00:08.443
WOMAN: SERIOUSLY,
THIS IS BEYOND GROSS.

00:08.486 --> 00:11.315
WHO LEAVES DIRTY
DISHES IN THE SINK?

00:11.359 --> 00:12.751
I KNOW WE BOUGHT
THIS HOUSE AS IT,

00:12.795 --> 00:14.492
BUT COME ON.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.407
MAN: I DON'T THINK
THIS WALL IS LOAD-BEARING, HON.

00:16.451 --> 00:19.541
WE CAN KNOCK IT OUT,
BUILD THE BABY'S NURSERY
IN THIS DIRECTION.

00:20.716 --> 00:21.760
I GUESS.

00:21.804 --> 00:23.501
HEY, WHAT'S
THE MATTER?

00:23.545 --> 00:25.286
YOU SURE WE DID
THE RIGHT THING?

00:25.329 --> 00:26.635
BUYING THIS PLACE,
I MEAN.

00:26.678 --> 00:27.897
IT'S KIND OF CREEPY.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.378
WE WANTED A PLACE
TO MAKE OUR OWN,
REMEMBER?

00:30.421 --> 00:32.858
COME ON, BABE.

00:32.902 --> 00:34.382
WE'RE GOING TO
BE HAPPY HERE.

00:34.425 --> 00:36.166
I PROMISE.

00:37.472 --> 00:39.213
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.442
WHAT THE HELL?

00:59.015 --> 01:02.801
THERE A HAZMAT SUIT
ANYWHERE AROUND HERE?

01:05.543 --> 01:07.154
BEN?

01:07.197 --> 01:08.764
YOU OK?

01:13.116 --> 01:14.509
AAH!

01:18.817 --> 01:20.558
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

01:20.602 --> 01:24.562
NEVER LIVE WHERE
YOUR COMMUTE
INVOLVES A BRIDGE.

01:24.606 --> 01:26.390
IT'S OK. I WAS JUST
GOING THROUGH
POTENTIAL CASES.

01:26.434 --> 01:29.915
HEY, I MEANT IT WHEN
I SAID YOU SHOULD TAKE
SOME TIME OFF.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.395
YOU'VE JUST BEEN
THROUGH A LOT.

01:31.439 --> 01:33.615
THAT'S LIKE
THE JOB DESCRIPTION

01:33.658 --> 01:35.312
OF EVERYBODY
WHO WORKS HERE.

01:35.356 --> 01:36.618
"MUST GO THROUGH A LOT."
I'M OK.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.489
THAT JUST CAME IN.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.144
A MUMMY?

01:41.188 --> 01:43.407
YEAH, THEY FOUND IT
INSIDE OF A WALL

01:43.451 --> 01:45.844
IN A CABIN OUTSIDE
VARNVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA.

01:45.888 --> 01:47.498
THEY THINK IT'S
REALLY OLD.

01:47.542 --> 01:48.543
WELL, IT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU SEE EVERY DAY,

01:48.586 --> 01:50.501
BUT IT SOUNDS MORE
LIKE A COLD CASE.

01:50.545 --> 01:51.676
THAT'S A NO THEN.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.156
HEY, WAIT A SECOND.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.940
ROSSI'S STILL IN
SAVANNAH, ISN'T HE?

01:54.984 --> 01:56.507
UH-HUH. HE COMES
BACK TODAY.

01:56.551 --> 01:59.075
AND HOW FAR IS VARNVILLE
FROM THE MAIN HIGHWAY?

02:00.468 --> 02:01.686
NOT FAR, LIKE 10 MILES.

02:01.730 --> 02:03.862
OK. WELL, MAYBE HE CAN
SWING BY ON HIS WAY OUT,

02:03.906 --> 02:05.560
TAKE A LOOK,
ADVISE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:05.603 --> 02:08.128
ON HOW TO PROCEED.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.043
NO PROBLEM, EMILY.

02:11.087 --> 02:13.611
I WAS JUST GETTING
READY TO CHECK OUT.

02:13.655 --> 02:15.265
DAVID, BEFORE
YOU DROP ME--

02:15.309 --> 02:17.006
SHH, SHH, SHH.

02:17.049 --> 02:20.401
UH, YEAH, HAVE GARCIA SEND ME
THE CONTACT INFORMATION

02:20.444 --> 02:22.054
AND I'LL COORDINATE
FROM THE ROAD.

02:22.098 --> 02:23.578
I'LL CHECK IN
WHEN I GET THERE.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.145
OK.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.498
DID YOU JUST SHUSH ME?

02:32.152 --> 02:34.154
I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS EMILY.

02:34.197 --> 02:36.373
OH. YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT
YOUR BOSS TO KNOW

02:36.417 --> 02:38.070
YOU HAVE A WOMAN
IN A HOTEL ROOM.

02:38.114 --> 02:41.596
WHAT I DON'T WANT IS
THE WHOLE TEAM
WEIGHING IN JUST YET.

02:41.639 --> 02:44.207
THEY TEND TO HAVE
A PROPRIETARY INTEREST

02:44.251 --> 02:45.469
IN MY LOVE LIFE.

02:45.513 --> 02:46.731
MM-HMM. OH.

02:46.775 --> 02:49.821
SHH.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.562
PORTIA.

02:52.650 --> 02:55.697
UH, YEAH, I'M LEAVING
FOR THE AIRPORT NOW.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.742
SAVANNAH IS LOVELY.

02:57.786 --> 03:02.704
LOT OF WORK, BUT I
MANAGED TO SQUEEZE IN
A LITTLE BIT OF FUN.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.009
YES.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.490
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN
I LAND AT JFK.

03:06.534 --> 03:07.578
BYE.

03:09.101 --> 03:11.191
SO YOU DON'T WANT
YOUR DAUGHTER TO KNOW

03:11.234 --> 03:13.236
YOU HAVE A MAN
IN YOUR HOTEL ROOM.

03:13.280 --> 03:17.371
DAVID ROSSI IS
A TOUCHY SUBJECT
RIGHT NOW.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.676
WHY?

03:18.720 --> 03:20.548
WELL, THE LAST TIME THE
3 OF US WERE TOGETHER,

03:20.591 --> 03:24.465
YOU LOBBED A GRENADE
INTO HER WEDDING PLANS.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.945
SHE WAS ABOUT TO MARRY
AN ABUSIVE CON MAN.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.513
OK, A GRENADE THAT
NEEDED TO BE LOBBED.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.733
I KNOW THAT
AND SHE KNOWS THAT.

03:31.776 --> 03:36.694
BUT THE WOUNDS ARE
A LITTLE FRESH RIGHT NOW,
THAT'S ALL.

03:36.738 --> 03:40.524
WHICH MEANS SHE DOESN'T
APPRECIATE YOU SLEEPING
WITH THE ENEMY.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.265
STOP IT.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.354
SHE DOESN'T THINK THAT
YOU'RE THE ENEMY.

03:44.398 --> 03:45.703
MMM.

03:47.618 --> 03:50.099
SHE JUST MET A NEW GUY,

03:50.142 --> 03:52.188
THE FIRST ONE THAT
SHE'S BEEN INTERESTED IN

03:52.232 --> 03:53.711
SINCE THE BREAKUP.

03:53.755 --> 03:54.843
THAT'S GREAT.

03:54.886 --> 03:57.759
SO MAYBE JUST FOR
A LITTLE BIT,

03:57.802 --> 04:00.022
WE KEEP THIS ON
THE DOWNLOW.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.555
I APPRECIATE THE HELP,
AGENT ROSSI.

04:11.599 --> 04:14.558
NOBODY'S TOUCHED
A THING, LIKE YOU ASKED.

04:14.602 --> 04:17.039
IS THE CORONER EN ROUTE
FROM CHARLESTON YET?

04:17.082 --> 04:18.736
THEY SHOULD BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.738
THE CADAVER DOG
JUST ARRIVED.

04:20.782 --> 04:21.783
MAN: GET TO WORK.
LET'S GO.

04:21.826 --> 04:23.872
WHO WERE
THE PREVIOUS OWNERS?

04:23.915 --> 04:25.917
THAT'D BE KARL
AND DOROTHY ELGIN.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.354
HERMITS.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.138
BUILT THE PLACE
BACK IN THE SIXTIES

04:29.181 --> 04:31.706
AND JUST HOLED UP.

04:31.749 --> 04:32.750
THEY STILL AROUND?

04:32.794 --> 04:34.186
OH, KARL DIED
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,

04:34.230 --> 04:36.537
AND DOROTHY'S BEEN PUT
IN A NURSING HOME.

04:36.580 --> 04:39.714
FROM WHAT I HEAR,
SHE'S PRETTY MUCH
LOST HER MARBLES.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.413
CAN'T IMAGINE WHO
THE BODY COULD BE.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.546
I MEAN, NOBODY'S
BEEN REPORTED MISSING

04:45.589 --> 04:48.679
AROUND THESE PARTS
THAT I CAN REMEMBER.

04:52.770 --> 04:55.773
DOG LOOKS LIKE
IT'S CONFUSED.

04:55.817 --> 04:59.777
THE DOG'S NOT CONFUSED,
IT'S OVERWHELMED.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.702
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC, AND CBS, INC.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.188
ROSSI: "MEMORY IS
A CRAZY WOMAN

06:03.232 --> 06:06.583
THAT HOARDS COLORED RAGS
AND THROWS AWAY FOOD."

06:06.627 --> 06:08.542
AUSTIN O'MALLEY.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.413
JJ: SO AS FAR AS
ANYONE KNOWS,

06:10.457 --> 06:13.242
KARL AND DOROTHY
ELGIN LIVED
TOTALLY ISOLATED.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.157
NO KIDS, NO FAMILY,
NO FRIENDS.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.289
50 YEARS. I MEAN,
THEY HAD TO HAVE

06:17.333 --> 06:18.987
SOME INTERACTION
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

06:19.030 --> 06:22.294
5 BODIES AND COUNTING,
ALL YOUNG FEMALES.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.384
CORONER SAYS THE VICTIMS
HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE.

06:24.427 --> 06:27.169
ARE WE LOOKING AT
A HUSBAND AND WIFE
KILLING TEAM HERE?

06:27.212 --> 06:28.910
IT'S RARE,
BUT IT DOES HAPPEN.

06:28.953 --> 06:31.391
IN ENGLAND,
ROSEMARY WEST ASSISTED
HER HUSBAND FRED

06:31.434 --> 06:32.696
IN THE MURDER OF
12 INDIVIDUALS

06:32.740 --> 06:34.481
OVER A 20-YEAR SPAN
WITHOUT DETECTION.

06:34.524 --> 06:37.440
DOROTHY ELGIN COULD
BE A HOMEGROWN VERSION
OF THAT--

06:37.484 --> 06:40.400
FEMALE ACCOMMODATING
THE PSYCHOPATHIC
URGES OF THE MAN.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.924
OK, BUT WHY MUMMIFY?

06:42.967 --> 06:45.100
FORENSIC COUNTERMEASURE,
MAYBE?

06:45.143 --> 06:47.232
HMM. THROWING THE BODIES
IN A SWAMP WOULD HAVE BEEN

06:47.276 --> 06:48.712
A BETTER FORENSIC
COUNTERMEASURE.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.279
LUKE'S RIGHT. IT WAS
A DELIBERATE CHOICE

06:50.322 --> 06:51.715
TO PRESERVE
THOSE CORPSES,

06:51.759 --> 06:53.021
KEEP THE VICTIMS
CLOSE TO HOME.

06:53.064 --> 06:54.239
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
THE KILLER THOUGHT

06:54.283 --> 06:56.111
HE WAS SENDING
THE BODIES INTO
THE FUTURE.

06:56.154 --> 06:58.243
ANCIENT EGYPTIANS
BELIEVED THE SOULS
OF THE DECEASED

06:58.287 --> 06:59.549
WOULD RETURN
FROM THE AFTERLIFE

06:59.593 --> 07:01.203
TO RE-INHABIT THEIR
ORIGINAL BODIES,

07:01.246 --> 07:04.206
SO THE HUMAN FORM
WAS KEPT IN TACT
AND RECOGNIZABLE.

07:04.249 --> 07:06.426
THERE'S ALSO A LITERAL
COVERING UP OF THE CRIME HERE,

07:06.469 --> 07:08.297
AND THAT SAYS REMORSE.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.342
MATT, JJ, GO TO
THE LOCAL SHERIFF'S
DEPARTMENT,

07:10.386 --> 07:12.301
HELP THEM PREPARE
FOR THE MEDIA FRENZY

07:12.344 --> 07:13.694
THAT'S COMING DOWN
THE PIKE.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.696
LUKE, YOU AND I WILL
MEET ROSSI AT
THE CRIME SCENE.

07:15.739 --> 07:17.611
REID, TARA, GO TO
THE NURSING HOME,

07:17.654 --> 07:19.308
SEE IF YOU CAN TALK
TO DOROTHY ELGIN.

07:19.351 --> 07:21.789
IF ANYONE KNOWS THE SECRETS
OF THAT HOUSE, IT'S HER.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.142
WOMAN: MRS. ELGIN WAS
COMMITTED HERE 3 MONTHS AGO.

07:27.185 --> 07:28.796
SHE WAS FOUND WANDERING
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN

07:28.839 --> 07:29.927
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.233
AND THE DIAGNOSIS
WAS DEMENTIA?

07:31.276 --> 07:32.408
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.670
HONESTLY, I DON'T
KNOW HOW MUCH LUCK

07:33.714 --> 07:34.671
Y'ALL ARE GONNA HAVE
TALKING TO HER.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.325
MRS. ELGIN DRIFTS
IN AND OUT.

07:36.368 --> 07:38.414
DID SHE BRING ANY
PERSONAL POSSESSIONS
WITH HER?

07:38.458 --> 07:39.850
SHE HAD A BAG WITH
SOME SMALL ITEMS

07:39.894 --> 07:41.417
WHEN THE POLICE
FOUND HER.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.505
I BELIEVE THEY'RE
STILL IN HER ROOM

07:42.549 --> 07:44.899
IF YOU WANT TO
TAKE A LOOK.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.248
WHAT ABOUT
VISITORS?

07:46.291 --> 07:48.555
NOT A ONE.
IT'S SAD, REALLY.

07:48.598 --> 07:52.428
MRS. ELGIN, THERE'S
SOME PEOPLE HERE TO SEE YOU.

07:58.086 --> 08:00.741
DOROTHY, HI.
I'M TARA.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.960
THIS IS
MY FRIEND REID.

08:03.004 --> 08:05.441
WE WERE HOPING TO
MAYBE TALK TO YOU

08:05.485 --> 08:07.095
ABOUT YOUR OLD HOUSE.

08:07.138 --> 08:10.838
WE THINK SOMETHING
BAD HAPPENED THERE.

08:10.881 --> 08:12.404
MAYBE WITH YOUR HELP,

08:12.448 --> 08:14.885
WE COULD FIX IT.

08:30.858 --> 08:32.512
ROSSI: GOOD.
YOU FOUND IT OK.

08:32.555 --> 08:33.991
HOW MANY VICTIMS
ARE WE UP TO?

08:34.035 --> 08:37.342
7, IN THE WALLS
AND UNDER THE FLOOR.

08:37.386 --> 08:39.388
THEY FOUND THIS BOX
FILLED WITH KNICKKNACKS

08:39.431 --> 08:40.650
NEXT TO ONE OF
THE BODIES.

08:40.694 --> 08:42.478
SOUVENIRS OF THEIR VICTIMS.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.740
WE SHOULD GET
DESCRIPTIONS OF
THESE ITEMS

08:43.784 --> 08:45.525
OUT TO THE PUBLIC.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.091
IT MIGHT JOG
SOMEONE'S MEMORY.

08:47.135 --> 08:51.052
DR. CALDWELL, THIS IS
SSA PRENTISS AND SSA ALVEZ.

08:51.095 --> 08:53.489
DR. CALDWELL'S WITH
THE CHARLESTON
CORONER'S OFFICE.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.534
SHE CAME UP
TO HELP US OUT.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.187
YEAH, LOCAL M.E.'s
NOT EQUIPPED

08:56.231 --> 08:57.667
TO HANDLE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

08:57.711 --> 09:00.191
SO I'M HAVING THE REMAINS
TAKEN BACK TO OUR FACILITIES.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.845
DO WE KNOW HOW LONG
THE BODIES HAVE BEEN HERE?

09:01.889 --> 09:04.718
BALLPARK, 20 YEARS.
SOME LONGER, SOME SHORTER.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.807
THIS ALL SEEMS
FAIRLY SOPHISTICATED.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.025
IT IS.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.374
THE INTERNAL ORGANS
WEREN'T REMOVED

09:09.418 --> 09:11.115
AS WITH A TRUE
MUMMIFICATION,

09:11.159 --> 09:13.204
BUT THE BODIES WERE TREATED
BEFORE BEING WRAPPED

09:13.248 --> 09:14.554
AND THEN SALTED.

09:14.597 --> 09:15.772
THAT'S WHY THERE'S
NO DISCERNIBLE ODOR.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.905
THOSE LOOK LIKE THE
TEETH OF A METH ADDICT.

09:17.948 --> 09:20.690
THESE WOMEN PROBABLY
ALL LIVED HIGH-RISK
LIFESTYLES--

09:20.734 --> 09:22.779
DRUG ADDICTS,
PROSTITUTES, RUNAWAYS.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.651
EXPLAINS WHY THEY MIGHT
VANISH FOR DECADES

09:24.694 --> 09:26.261
AND NOBODY KNOWS
OR CARES.

09:26.304 --> 09:27.567
SOMEBODY CARED.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.351
THE VICTIMS' CLOTHES
WERE MENDED,

09:29.394 --> 09:31.483
CAREFULLY SEWN,
AND KEPT IN GOOD REPAIR.

09:31.527 --> 09:33.355
MAN: DR. CALDWELL,

09:33.398 --> 09:35.400
YOU BETTER COME
LOOK AT THIS.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.192
THESE VICTIMS DON'T
LOOK AS OLD.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.367
CALDWELL: THEY AREN'T.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.804
THEY'VE BEEN DEAD
LESS THAN A YEAR.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.806
MEANING AFTER
KARL DIED

09:49.850 --> 09:51.503
AND DOROTHY BECAME
AN INVALID.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.244
THIS COLD CASE
JUST GOT HOT.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.811
WE'VE GOT AN ACTIVE UNSUB.

10:03.472 --> 10:04.952
FIND ANYTHING
IN HER ROOM?

10:04.995 --> 10:06.301
JUST THE ITEMS
SHE HAD WITH HER
WHEN SHE WAS PICKED UP--

10:06.344 --> 10:07.607
A HAND MIRROR,
A DECK OF CARDS,

10:07.650 --> 10:08.999
AND A HAIRBRUSH.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.784
PRENTISS.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.663
DOROTHY, I WAS HOPING
MAYBE WE COULD TALK

10:20.707 --> 10:23.448
ABOUT SOMETHING
ELSE, OK?

10:23.492 --> 10:25.668
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER
YOUR HUSBAND PASSED?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.844
DID ANYONE NEW
EVER COME OUT--

10:27.888 --> 10:28.802
IT WON'T WORK.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.064
EXCUSE ME?

10:30.107 --> 10:31.979
IT WON'T WORK.
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.458
WHAT IS NOT THE SAME?

10:33.502 --> 10:34.416
IT'S NOT THE SAME!

10:34.459 --> 10:36.592
OK, DOROTHY,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.463
WE BELIEVE YOU.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.497
ARE THE BODIES RECOGNIZABLE?

11:12.541 --> 11:14.021
MS. UNDERWOOD--

11:14.064 --> 11:15.675
BECAUSE ON THE NEWS
THEY SAID THEY WERE PRESERVED.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.415
IT'S BEST TO WAIT
UNTIL DNA CAN--

11:17.459 --> 11:18.634
I'M NOT AFRAID TO LOOK.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.767
I DON'T CARE HOW
AWFUL IT IS.

11:20.810 --> 11:23.378
DARIA WAS MY ONLY SISTER.

11:23.421 --> 11:27.599
THE DAY SHE RAN AWAY
I WAS IN SCHOOL,

11:27.643 --> 11:30.341
SEVENTH GRADE.

11:30.385 --> 11:33.649
I DIDN'T EVEN GET
A CHANCE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.523
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE FEELING.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.482
BELIEVE ME, I DO.

11:40.525 --> 11:42.658
LOOK, I HAVE YOUR
CONTACT INFORMATION.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.706
IF WE GET ANY NEWS,
I'LL BE IN TOUCH, OK?

11:46.749 --> 11:48.490
THIS WAY, MA'AM.THANK YOU.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.929
TOUGH SITUATION.

11:52.973 --> 11:55.453
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET
SOME ANSWERS SOON.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.717
WELL, WE'VE IDENTIFIED
THE TWO LATEST VICTIMS--

11:57.760 --> 12:00.371
JUNE BERKHOLT
AND AMY SANDERS,

12:00.415 --> 12:02.025
BOTH IN THEIR FORTIES.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.724
ABDUCTED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
WHILE DOING ERRANDS.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.378
ANYWAY, PRENTISS WANTS US
TO DRIVE TO CHARLESTON

12:07.422 --> 12:09.032
TO SEE WHAT ELSE
THE M.E. HAS.

12:29.096 --> 12:31.185
HELP ME!

12:32.926 --> 12:34.666
HELP ME!

12:34.710 --> 12:36.146
PLEASE!

12:52.859 --> 12:55.252
JUST ANOTHER
DAY AT THE OFFICE.

12:55.296 --> 12:59.082
MAMA ALWAYS SAID I SHOULD
HAVE STUDIED ACCOUNTING.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.693
IT'S PROBABLY EASIEST
IF WE LOOKED AT THESE

13:01.737 --> 13:03.347
AS TWO SEPARATE,
DISTINCT CRIMES--

13:03.391 --> 13:04.914
THE PAST AND THE PRESENT.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.829
SIMPLICITY'S GOOD.
FIRE AWAY.

13:06.873 --> 13:09.397
LET'S START WITH
THE 7 VICTIMS
FROM THE PAST.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.702
ALL WERE FEMALE
CAUCASIANS

13:10.746 --> 13:12.792
IN THEIR LATE TEENS
TO MID-TWENTIES,

13:12.835 --> 13:16.404
BRUNETTES, SMALL BONED,
AROUND 5'6," 5'7".

13:16.447 --> 13:18.580
THEY WERE KILLED OVER
A PERIOD OF TWO DECADES,

13:18.623 --> 13:20.756
ROUGHLY 1988 TO 2008.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.323
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED?

13:22.366 --> 13:25.587
NO. NO SIGNS OF RAPE,
TORTURE, OR PROLONGED
CONFINEMENT.

13:25.630 --> 13:26.936
JJ: WHAT ABOUT C.O.D.?

13:26.980 --> 13:28.546
POISON.

13:28.590 --> 13:29.852
THAT SKEWS FEMALE.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.246
PUTS DOROTHY SOLIDLY
IN THE PICTURE.

13:32.289 --> 13:33.943
NOW FOR THE PRESENT.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.684
TWO LATEST VICTIMS
RANGED IN AGE

13:35.727 --> 13:38.948
FROM 42 TO 46 AND HAD
A ROUGHER TIME OF IT.

13:38.992 --> 13:41.733
THEY BOTH SUFFERED
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA
TO THE HEAD.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.735
WE'RE DEFINITELY DEALING
WITH TWO DIFFERENT
KILLERS HERE.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.129
AN OFFENDER'S SIGNATURE
WOULDN'T DEVIATE
THAT DRAMATICALLY.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.610
YEAH, THERE IS
A LOT MORE ANGER

13:48.653 --> 13:49.829
IN OUR ACTIVE UNSUB.

13:49.872 --> 13:52.005
AND SADISM.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.181
I FOUND INSULATION RESIDUE
IN THE VICTIM'S LUNGS.

13:54.224 --> 13:58.576
SO THE WOMEN WERE
ENTOMBED WHILE THEY
WERE STILL ALIVE.

14:01.449 --> 14:05.018
OUR UNSUB HAS TO BE
SOMEONE CLOSE
TO THE ELGINS.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.846
HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH
THE EARLIER KILLINGS

14:06.889 --> 14:08.456
AND TRIED TO EMULATE THEM.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.240
ALVEZ: A FRIEND, MAYBE,

14:10.284 --> 14:11.894
OR A FAMILY MEMBER
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.243
OK, LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK

14:13.287 --> 14:14.723
AND REVIEW WHAT WE'VE
GOT SO FAR.

14:14.766 --> 14:17.639
KARL ELGIN BEGAN KILLING
YOUNG RUNAWAY TYPES

14:17.682 --> 14:19.293
STARTING BACK IN
THE EIGHTIES.

14:19.336 --> 14:21.512
BROUGHT THEM BACK TO
THE HOUSE USING SOME
SORT OF RUSE,

14:21.556 --> 14:23.384
A HOT MEAL,
ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD.

14:23.427 --> 14:26.213
SO MANY VICTIMS OVER
SUCH A LONG TIME SPAN,

14:26.256 --> 14:27.736
DOROTHY HAD TO BE
COMPLICIT.

14:27.779 --> 14:28.824
MORE THAN THAT, MAYBE.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.391
SHE COULD HAVE BEEN
CALLING THE SHOTS,

14:30.434 --> 14:33.002
REINING IN THE MORE
VIOLENT TENDENCIES
OF HER HUSBAND.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.396
NOW FAST FORWARD
TO PRESENT DAY,

14:35.439 --> 14:37.833
AND YEARS AFTER KARL'S
LAST VICTIM,

14:37.877 --> 14:40.357
TWO MORE WOMEN ARE KILLED
IN THE SPAN OF 12 MONTHS.

14:40.401 --> 14:43.360
MURDERS THAT
COINCIDENTALLY STARTED
SHORTLY AFTER KARL DIED.

14:43.404 --> 14:45.754
GARCIA.
DIGAME.

14:45.797 --> 14:47.930
HAVE YOU FOUND ANY
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE
TWO WOMEN WE JUST ID'd?

14:47.974 --> 14:51.673
NO, I HAVE NOT.
BOTH WERE MARRIED
AND HAD CHILDREN,

14:51.716 --> 14:53.849
PARTICIPATED IN
THEIR COMMUNITIES.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.285
THEY BOTH SEEM LIKE
MODEL CITIZENS.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.766
TWO WOMEN LIKE THAT
GO MISSING IN LESS
THAN A YEAR

14:57.809 --> 15:00.029
AND NOBODY DOWN HERE
CONNECTS THE DOTS?

15:05.774 --> 15:07.123
LEWIS: YOU'RE PRETTY
GREAT AT THAT.

15:07.167 --> 15:08.995
MY AUNT LOVED TO SEW.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.822
I WAS A TOMBOY,

15:10.866 --> 15:12.563
ALWAYS TEARING
MY JEANS,

15:12.607 --> 15:14.435
AND SHE WOULD
MEND THEM,

15:14.478 --> 15:17.177
MAKE THEM GOOD AS NEW.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.353
NOW, DOROTHY, YOU CAN
BE TRUTHFUL WITH US

15:19.396 --> 15:20.832
ABOUT KARL AND THE GIRLS.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.095
WE KNOW YOU CARED ABOUT THEM.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.661
THAT'S WHY YOU FIXED
THEIR CLOTHING.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.796
I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S TIME
FOR MRS. ELGIN'S MEDICINE.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.798
DOROTHY, YOU SAID
SOMETHING EARLIER.

15:29.841 --> 15:32.844
"IT WON'T WORK.
IT'S NOT THE SAME."
WHAT DID THAT MEAN?

15:34.498 --> 15:35.978
DID I SAY THAT?

15:36.022 --> 15:37.980
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

15:38.024 --> 15:39.895
NO.

15:41.592 --> 15:42.898
I'LL BRING HER BACK
IN A FEW MINUTES

15:42.942 --> 15:44.552
IF YOU'D LIKE TO WAIT.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.648
SOMETHING'S
GOING ON WITH HER.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.436
NURSE:
NO! NO!

15:59.480 --> 16:00.655
CALL 9-1-1.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.831
MAN: SOMEBODY HELP.
HELP HER.

16:11.274 --> 16:13.276
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
THANKS.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.018
DOROTHY DIED ON
THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.498
WHATEVER SHE KNEW
DIED WITH HER.

16:17.541 --> 16:18.847
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE DID THAT.

16:18.890 --> 16:22.242
WELL, MAYBE THE GUILT
GOT TO BE TOO MUCH FOR HER.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.331
IS THAT EVERYTHING?
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE?

16:24.374 --> 16:26.376
THOSE ARE THE ONLY ITEMS
SHE BROUGHT FROM HER HOUSE.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.988
ALL RIGHT, DOROTHY WAS
PICKED UP BY THE POLICE

16:29.031 --> 16:30.032
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

16:30.076 --> 16:31.729
SHE WAS BROUGHT HERE,
WENT TO BED,

16:31.773 --> 16:33.514
BUT SHE WASN'T PROCESSED
UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING.

16:33.557 --> 16:37.518
SO SHE HAD A SMALL WINDOW
OF UNSUPERVISED TIME.

16:37.561 --> 16:39.650
WHAT'S THE ONE THING
WE KNOW FOR SURE
ABOUT THE ELGINS?

16:39.694 --> 16:40.738
THEY LIKE TO HIDE THINGS.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.218
YEAH.

16:42.262 --> 16:46.657
JEWELRY, KEYCHAINS,
BODIES, YOU KNOW,

16:46.701 --> 16:48.616
THE IMPORTANT STUFF.

17:19.995 --> 17:21.997
OLD HABITS DIE HARD.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.621
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:40.015 --> 17:43.366
WE COULD TALK.
IT'D BE NICE.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.368
I...

17:45.412 --> 17:47.457
JUST TELL ME WHAT
YOU'RE WRITING THERE.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.421
YOU'RE SCARING ME.

18:18.401 --> 18:20.751
THE VICTIMS PROBABLY
WROTE THESE.

18:20.795 --> 18:23.014
WE'RE HAVING FORENSICS
EXPEDITE THE PROCESSING
OF THE ENVELOPES.

18:23.058 --> 18:24.581
PRENTISS: AT LEAST NOW
WE HAVE NAMES AND ADDRESSES.

18:24.625 --> 18:27.715
LET'S SEE IF GARCIA
CAN TRACK DOWN
THE INTENDED RECIPIENTS.

18:27.758 --> 18:30.457
WHY WRITE LETTERS THAT
NEVER EVEN GOT MAILED?

18:30.500 --> 18:32.023
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A WAY
FOR KARL AND DOROTHY

18:32.067 --> 18:33.895
TO PSYCHOLOGICALLY
CONTROL THEIR VICTIMS,

18:33.938 --> 18:35.549
ALLOW THEM TO WRITE
LETTERS TO LOVED ONES,

18:35.592 --> 18:38.465
GIVE THEM A SENSE
OF BEING IN A SAFE
AND NURTURING ENVIRONMENT.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.597
WHICH MAKES
THE BEHAVIORAL PROFILE

18:40.641 --> 18:42.817
LESS SOCIOPATHIC,
ODDLY ENOUGH.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.166
HOW COME?

18:44.210 --> 18:45.820
TO USE PARENTAL LOVE
AS A MANIPULATING DEVICE

18:45.863 --> 18:47.735
MEANS THEY HAVE
AN UNDERSTANDING OF
THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.215
MOST SOCIOPATHS DON'T.

18:49.258 --> 18:51.217
BY DEFINITION,
THEY LACK THE SENSE

18:51.260 --> 18:53.349
OF HUMAN CONNECTEDNESS
THE REST OF US FEEL.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.873
THE ELGINS MUST HAVE
EXPERIENCED IT FIRST HAND.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.701
SHERIFF: I DON'T SEE
HOW THEY COULD.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.660
KARL AND DOROTHY
DIDN'T HAVE ANY KIDS.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.270
WAS THAT EVER VERIFIED?

19:01.314 --> 19:02.619
WELL, I'D DRIVE OUT
THERE NOW AND THEN

19:02.663 --> 19:04.317
JUST TO CHECK IN
ON THEM,

19:04.360 --> 19:06.493
AND I NEVER SAW
ANOTHER SOUL BESIDES
KARL AND DOROTHY.

19:06.536 --> 19:09.191
SHERIFF, HAVE YOU EVER
HEARD THE SAYING,

19:09.235 --> 19:13.369
DOES A TREE FALLING
IN AN EMPTY FOREST
MAKE A SOUND?

19:14.849 --> 19:18.679
IT'S A METAPHYSICAL RIDDLE
ABOUT UNPERCEIVED EXISTENCE.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.071
THE ANSWER'S LARGELY
DEPENDENT ON WHETHER

19:20.115 --> 19:22.030
YOU SUBSCRIBE TO
SUBSTANCE OR BUNDLE THEORY.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.727
IN THIS CASE, I BELIEVE
AGENT PRENTISS

19:23.771 --> 19:25.599
IS SAYING THAT, YES,
THE TREE DOES MAKE A SOUND.

19:25.642 --> 19:27.557
PRENTISS: THANK YOU.

19:27.601 --> 19:28.950
SURPRISE, SURPRISE.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.865
AUTOPSY ON DOROTHY ELGIN
REVEALS AT SOME POINT

19:30.908 --> 19:32.649
IN HER LIFE SHE
DID GIVE BIRTH.

19:32.693 --> 19:33.955
I'LL BE DAMNED.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.565
WITH THE RECENT KILLINGS,
THE SIGNATURE CHANGED.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.088
ALL THE FEMININE
ASPECTS WENT AWAY.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.568
WHAT IF DOROTHY
HAD A SON?

19:39.830 --> 19:41.658
HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT
THE EARLIER KILLINGS,

19:41.702 --> 19:43.051
MAYBE EVEN WITNESSED THEM.

19:43.094 --> 19:44.531
AND THEN WHEN
THE PATRIARCH DIED,

19:44.574 --> 19:46.837
HE WAS THERE TO
PICK UP THE TORCH.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.449
DOROTHY DIDN'T COMMIT
SUICIDE FROM GUILT.

19:49.492 --> 19:52.103
IT WAS TO PROTECT
THE PERSON SHE KNEW
OR SUSPECTED

19:52.147 --> 19:55.542
MIGHT BE BEHIND
THE CURRENT MURDERS--
HER OWN CHILD.

19:55.585 --> 19:58.022
IN HER DEMENTIA,
SHE COULDN'T TRUST WHAT
SHE MIGHT LET SLIP.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.808
SO RATHER THAN RISK
INCRIMINATING HER OWN BOY,

20:00.851 --> 20:02.766
SHE TOOK HERSELF
OUT OF THE PICTURE.

20:02.810 --> 20:06.379
OK, A LOCAL WOMAN
NAMED MARY BREWER
WAS JUST REPORTED MISSING.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.511
40 YEARS OLD,
BRUNETTE, 5'6".

20:08.555 --> 20:10.644
WELL, THE SON'S
VICTIMOLOGY MATCHES
THAT OF THE FATHER'S

20:10.687 --> 20:12.689
IN TERMS OF TYPE,
BUT HE HIS AGING
THE WOMEN UP.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.952
SO IF THE EARLIER
VICTIMS WOULD HAVE LIVED,

20:14.996 --> 20:16.606
THEY'D BE THE AGE
OF THE CURRENT VICTIMS.

20:16.650 --> 20:19.653
THESE SURROGATES MUST
MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS

20:19.696 --> 20:21.220
TO THE TWO DIFFERENT
KILLERS.

20:21.263 --> 20:24.701
OK, WELL, FORENSICS JUST
FINISHED UP WITH THE ENVELOPES.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.845
DON'T, PLEASE.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.840
SING ME A SONG.

21:16.884 --> 21:18.799
WHAT?

21:21.236 --> 21:24.065
I'M SAD.

21:27.416 --> 21:31.507
♪ HUSH, LITTLE BABY

21:31.551 --> 21:33.814
♪ DON'T SAY A WORD

21:33.857 --> 21:40.951

22:03.583 --> 22:05.541
SIMMONS: WORDS FROM
THE GRAVE.

22:05.585 --> 22:08.022
OUR UNSUB'S IDENTITY
COULD BE HIDDEN IN HERE.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.807
LET'S DO IT.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.812
"DEAR, MOM AND DAD,
IT'S ME DELTA.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.727
GETTING THIS LETTER,
YOU MUST BE SHOCKED."

22:17.771 --> 22:20.687
WOMAN, VOICE-OVER:
I DON'T THINK I EVER WROTE
ANYTHING TO YOU BEFORE.

22:20.730 --> 22:23.559
I'M STAYING WITH A NICE
OLDER COUPLE I MET
WHEN I WAS HITCHHIKING.

22:23.603 --> 22:26.345
WE PLAY CARDS AND THINGS.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.172
I'M GETTING HEALTHY.

22:29.826 --> 22:32.438
THERE'S A POND WHERE KARL'S
TEACHING ME HOW TO FISH.

22:32.481 --> 22:33.917
HE'S SO NICE.

22:33.961 --> 22:36.398
"KARL IS DOROTHY'S HUSBAND."

22:41.751 --> 22:42.926
SECOND WOMAN, VOICE-OVER:
DON'T WORRY BECAUSE
THEY TREAT ME

22:42.970 --> 22:44.928
JUST LIKE I WAS
THEIR OWN DAUGHTER.

22:44.972 --> 22:47.191
I'LL BE COMING HOME
NEXT WEEK.

22:47.235 --> 22:49.716
HONEST.

22:55.896 --> 22:58.986
THIRD WOMAN, VOICE-OVER:
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD
WHEN YOU SEE ME.

22:59.029 --> 23:01.118
JUST HOLD ME.

23:01.162 --> 23:03.382
I LOVE YOU.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.821
THEY HAD NO IDEA
WHAT WAS IN STORE.

23:07.864 --> 23:11.651
THE COMMON REFRAIN
IS "THEY TREATED ME LIKE

23:11.694 --> 23:13.130
I WAS THEIR OWN DAUGHTER."

23:13.174 --> 23:15.916
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT THE ABDUCTIONS
WERE ALL ABOUT.

23:15.959 --> 23:18.571
KARL AND DOROTHY,
THEY HAD A SON,

23:18.614 --> 23:20.311
MAYBE THEY WANTED
TO ADD A DAUGHTER.

23:20.355 --> 23:22.009
BUILDING A FAMILY?

23:22.052 --> 23:25.447
OK, WE NEED TO GO WIDER.

23:25.491 --> 23:28.145
WE'RE HERE TODAY TO ENLIST
THE HELP OF THE PUBLIC

23:28.189 --> 23:29.973
IN FINDING MARY BREWER.

23:30.017 --> 23:33.194
PRENTISS: THE PERSON WE
BELIEVE IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR TAKING MARY IS A MAN

23:33.237 --> 23:35.979
WITH A CLOSE CONNECTION
TO KARL AND DOROTHY ELGIN,

23:36.023 --> 23:38.939
THE COUPLE SUSPECTED
IN THE MURDERS

23:38.982 --> 23:41.202
OF 7 OTHER WOMEN
MANY YEARS AGO.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.857
SIMMONS: THERE'S EVIDENCE
THAT THE COUPLE MAY HAVE
HAD A CHILD.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.860
AND GIVEN THAT THE KILLINGS
PROFILE STRONGLY AS MALE,

23:46.903 --> 23:49.471
WE COULD BE LOOKING AT
A HERETOFORE UNKNOWN SON.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.604
WE'RE HOPING OTHERS
MIGHT HAVE HAD CONTACT

23:51.647 --> 23:53.214
WITH THE FAMILY
AND SURVIVED.

23:53.257 --> 23:56.173
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE
WE'RE REACHING OUT TO.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.742
SIMMONS: THIS KILLER
IS NOT CRIMINALLY SOPHISTICATED,

23:59.786 --> 24:02.092
AND HE'S ABDUCTING
HIGH-PROFILE TARGETS
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.921
THIS IS AN INDICATOR
THAT THE PERSON WE'RE
SEARCHING FOR

24:04.965 --> 24:06.140
MAY BE DEVOLVING.

24:06.183 --> 24:08.969
THIS MAKES HIM SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE DANGEROUS.

24:09.012 --> 24:11.711
WE NEED YOUR HELP
TO FIND MARY BREWER,

24:11.754 --> 24:14.453
BUT ALSO TO GIVE LOVED ONES
OF THE EARLIER VICTIMS

24:14.496 --> 24:16.019
THE CLOSURE THEY DESERVE.

24:16.063 --> 24:19.458
JJ: WE URGE ANYONE
WHO MAY HAVE PERTINENT
INFORMATION

24:19.501 --> 24:21.851
TO CONTACT THE FBI
AT THE NUMBER PROVIDED.

24:21.895 --> 24:23.853
THANK YOU.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.787
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

24:44.831 --> 24:47.486
IT'S NOT FOR YOU.

25:09.029 --> 25:11.292
YOU WANT ME
TO FEED YOU?

25:26.307 --> 25:28.527
A PLANE.
WHAT?

25:28.570 --> 25:30.964
MAKE IT A PLANE...

25:31.007 --> 25:33.096
FLYING IN.

25:49.765 --> 25:51.550
HERE IT COMES.

25:51.593 --> 25:53.508
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

25:55.945 --> 25:58.600
OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.210
INTO THE HANGAR.

26:06.173 --> 26:08.697
UHH!

26:16.966 --> 26:20.056
WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME?!

26:28.325 --> 26:29.805
MARY BREWER'S HUSBAND'S
ON HIS WAY IN,

26:29.849 --> 26:32.155
AND WE GOT AN APB OUT
ON HER VEHICLE RIGHT NOW.

26:32.199 --> 26:33.592
MEDIA OUTREACH IS WORKING.

26:33.635 --> 26:34.810
NOW IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF SORTING THROUGH

26:34.854 --> 26:36.464
WHICH LEADS ARE REAL
AND WHICH AREN'T.

26:36.507 --> 26:38.597
UNFORTUNATELY, GARCIA'S
NOT HAVING MUCH LUCK
WITH THE LETTERS.

26:38.640 --> 26:42.818
THE INTENDED RECIPIENTS
HAVE EITHER PASSED AWAY
OR MOVED ELSEWHERE.

26:42.862 --> 26:45.081
EXCUSE ME, AGENTS.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.736
THIS WOMAN SAYS IT'S
IMPORTANT THAT SHE TALK
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

26:47.780 --> 26:51.522
I'M AGENT PRENTISS.
THIS IS AGENT SIMMONS.
HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?

26:52.785 --> 26:55.091
KARL AND DOROTHY ELGIN,
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A SON.

26:55.135 --> 26:57.616
OK. AND YOU KNOW
THIS HOW?

26:57.659 --> 26:59.661
I GREW UP IN THAT HOUSE.

26:59.705 --> 27:02.403
KARL AND DOROTHY ELGIN
WERE MY PARENTS.

27:06.059 --> 27:08.322
APPARENTLY SHE RAN
AWAY FROM HOME WHEN
SHE WAS 16

27:08.365 --> 27:09.715
AND NEVER LOOKED BACK.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.325
THINK SHE'S LEGIT
OR JUST SOMEBODY

27:11.368 --> 27:13.022
LOOKING FOR THEIR
15 MINUTES OF FAME?

27:13.066 --> 27:17.331
SHERIFF SAID SHE WAS
ABLE TO DESCRIBE THE
ELGINS' HOUSE IN DETAIL.

27:17.374 --> 27:18.985
WOMAN: MY MOM AND DAD
WEREN'T NORMAL,

27:19.028 --> 27:20.551
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT,

27:20.595 --> 27:22.597
BUT THEY WEREN'T KILLERS.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.426
NOT NORMAL HOW?

27:25.469 --> 27:27.689
IT WAS JUST THEM.

27:27.733 --> 27:30.518
ALL THEY EVER TALKED
ABOUT WAS GETTING
AWAY FROM PEOPLE.

27:30.561 --> 27:31.998
IS THAT WHY YOU RAN AWAY?

27:32.041 --> 27:35.262
YEAH. I MEAN,
I HAD NO FRIENDS,

27:35.305 --> 27:37.612
WASN'T EVEN ALLOWED
TO GO INTO TOWN.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.005
TOWARDS THE END,
I'D SNEAK AWAY AT NIGHT,

27:39.048 --> 27:40.702
HANG OUT WITH KIDS
MY OWN AGE.

27:40.746 --> 27:41.877
AND DO WHAT?

27:41.921 --> 27:43.139
TALK, DRINK BEER.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.488
WHAT NORMAL
TEENAGERS DO.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.621
WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE
TO LEAVE FOR GOOD?

27:46.665 --> 27:49.406
ONE DAY I JUST
OPENED THE DOOR

27:49.450 --> 27:51.365
AND WALKED OUT
AND NEVER CAME BACK.

27:51.408 --> 27:54.977
MOVED TO GEORGIA,
GOT MYSELF A NEW LIFE.

27:55.021 --> 27:56.979
MARRIED, TWO KIDS.

27:58.415 --> 28:00.026
LEEANNE,

28:00.069 --> 28:02.724
WERE YOU THERE WHEN
YOUR PARENTS STARTED
MURDERING THOSE GIRLS?

28:02.768 --> 28:04.465
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TRYING TO TELL YOU.

28:04.508 --> 28:06.467
THEY COULDN'T HAVE
DONE ALL THE THINGS
PEOPLE ARE SAYING.

28:06.510 --> 28:07.990
IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE,

28:08.034 --> 28:11.080
SOME OTHER MONSTER.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.738
MARY: I'M SORRY.

28:16.782 --> 28:20.220
LET ME PUT A BANDAGE
ON YOUR HEAD.

28:20.263 --> 28:24.354
I'LL--I'LL TAKE
CARE OF YOU.

28:24.398 --> 28:26.443
I PROMISE.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.892
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:47.160 --> 28:48.857
NO!

28:55.559 --> 28:57.518
SO IT WASN'T ABOUT
CREATING A DAUGHTER.

28:57.561 --> 29:00.739
THEY WERE TRYING TO
REPLACE THE DAUGHTER
THEY'D LOST.

29:00.782 --> 29:04.873
YOU KNOW, LEEANNE'S
5'7", BRUNETTE,
SMALL BONED.

29:04.917 --> 29:07.441
YEAH, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
STILL NOT SITTING RIGHT.

29:07.484 --> 29:11.488
A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL ONE DAY
WALKS AWAY FROM THE ONLY
WORLD SHE'S EVER KNOWN,

29:11.532 --> 29:14.361
NO MONEY,
NO RESOURCES, NOTHING.

29:14.404 --> 29:18.191
THERE'S MORE TO THIS
THAN RUN-OF-THE-MILL
TEENAGE ANGST.

29:18.234 --> 29:20.584
YEAH, SOMETHING
TRIGGERED HER DECISION.

29:21.977 --> 29:24.023
ROSSI: PENELOPE.DAVID.

29:24.066 --> 29:27.591
LEEANNE GARRITY
RAN AWAY FROM HOME

29:27.635 --> 29:29.898
IN EITHER THE SPRING
OR SUMMER OF 1988.

29:29.942 --> 29:32.771
DID ANYTHING UNUSUAL
HAPPEN IN THE AREA BACK THEN?

29:32.814 --> 29:34.860
I AM A FIRM BELIEVER
THAT UNUSUAL

29:34.903 --> 29:37.471
LIES IN THE BRAIN
OF THE BEHOLDER.

29:37.514 --> 29:39.299
HAVING SAID THAT,

29:39.342 --> 29:41.562
THE MAJORITY OF BRAINS
WOULD SAY THAT THIS QUALIFIES.

29:41.605 --> 29:45.566
JUNE 5, 1988, LOCAL FARMER
NAMED ROGER MILBURN

29:45.609 --> 29:47.829
KILLED HIS WIFE
AND HIS TEENAGE SON

29:47.873 --> 29:49.570
BEFORE TAKING HIS OWN LIFE.

29:49.613 --> 29:51.920
IT WAS HUGE LOCAL NEWS
AT THE TIME.

29:51.964 --> 29:53.574
ROSSI: THANK YOU.

29:53.617 --> 29:55.358
LEEANNE MUST HAVE
HEARD ABOUT THAT.

29:55.402 --> 29:58.274
IF SHE WAS IN DENIAL
ABOUT HER PARENTS'
HOMICIDAL TENDENCIES,

29:58.318 --> 30:00.233
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
ONE HELL OF A WAKEUP CALL.

30:00.276 --> 30:03.236
YEAH, SHE COULD HAVE
FEARED THE SAME THING
HAPPENING TO HER.

30:03.279 --> 30:04.977
JJ, CAN YOU
AND THE BOY GENIUS

30:05.020 --> 30:07.240
TAKE A LOOK AT WHATEVER
THEY MAY HAVE ON FILE
ABOUT THAT OLD CASE?

30:07.283 --> 30:09.068
YEAH, YOU GOT IT.

30:11.592 --> 30:14.421
OK, SO THIS IS EVERYTHING
COLLECTED FROM THE MILBURN
CRIME SCENE?

30:14.464 --> 30:15.552
YES, MA'AM.

30:15.596 --> 30:17.511
JJ, LOOK AT THIS.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.082
YEAH, THAT DOESN'T TRACK.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.039
WHAT DOESN'T?

30:24.083 --> 30:25.649
BULLET TRAJECTORIES,
BODY ANGLES,

30:25.693 --> 30:26.868
AND BLOOD SPATTER
ARE NOT CONSISTENT

30:26.912 --> 30:28.087
WITH A MURDER-SUICIDE.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.871
WERE ROGER MILBURN'S
HANDS EVER TESTED

30:29.915 --> 30:31.742
FOR GUN POWDER RESIDUE?

30:31.786 --> 30:35.311
NO, MA'AM. IT SEEMED
LIKE AN OPEN-AND-SHUT
CASE BACK THEN.

30:35.355 --> 30:37.748
THIS CRIME SCENE WAS STAGED.
SOMEONE ELSE KILLED THIS FAMILY.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.888
JJ: IT WAS JUST A MOTHER,
FATHER, AND TEENAGE SON

30:46.932 --> 30:48.890
LIVING AT THE MILBURN
HOUSE, CORRECT?

30:48.934 --> 30:49.935
NO ONE ELSE?

30:49.978 --> 30:51.371
THAT'S RIGHT.

30:51.414 --> 30:54.330
WHAT WERE THEY DOING
WITH A BABY BOTTLE?

30:55.984 --> 30:57.333
WHERE DID THE MILBURNS LIVE?

30:57.377 --> 30:59.074
UH...

31:03.949 --> 31:05.689
RIGHT THERE.

31:05.733 --> 31:08.431
THAT'S RIGHT NEXT
TO THE ELGIN PROPERTY.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.828
LEWIS: YOU WEREN'T
ENTIRELY TRUTHFUL
WITH US, LEEANNE.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.612
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

31:15.656 --> 31:17.963
THOSE NIGHTS THAT
YOU WENT SNEAKING OUT,

31:18.006 --> 31:20.530
THERE WAS ONLY ONE KID
THAT YOU WENT TO HANG
OUT WITH, RIGHT?

31:20.574 --> 31:23.229
AND YOU DIDN'T JUST
DRINK BEER.

31:23.272 --> 31:25.579
YOU GOT PREGNANT.

31:26.710 --> 31:28.538
NO.

31:34.718 --> 31:35.937
WHERE DID YOU--

31:35.981 --> 31:38.505
THE MILBURN FAMILY.
THEY LIVED CLOSE BY.

31:38.548 --> 31:41.029
THEIR TEENAGE SON STEVE,
HE WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE, RIGHT?

31:41.073 --> 31:43.597
ALVEZ: HE'S THE ONE YOU
WERE SNEAKING OUT TO SEE.

31:43.640 --> 31:46.339
I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR IT TO HAPPEN.

31:49.385 --> 31:52.432
DID YOUR PARENTS KNOW?

31:52.475 --> 31:54.651
I HAD THE BABY
AT THE HOUSE.

31:54.695 --> 31:56.349
IN SECRET.

31:56.392 --> 31:58.568
LEWIS: AND WHAT ABOUT STEVE?

31:58.612 --> 32:00.875
NOBODY KNEW.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.660
MY MOM AND DAD SAID
THEY'D RAISE THE BABY
THEMSELVES,

32:03.704 --> 32:06.881
BUT IT ONLY
MADE THEM CRAZIER.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.448
I'D EVEN GET TIED
TO THE BED SOMETIMES

32:08.491 --> 32:10.580
TO MAKE SURE I WOULDN'T
GO RUNNING OFF AGAIN.

32:10.624 --> 32:11.930
BUT YOU DID ANYWAY.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.496
ONE NIGHT I HAD A CHANCE,

32:13.540 --> 32:15.716
SO I TOOK MY LITTLE BOY
AND I RAN.

32:15.759 --> 32:18.893
I DROPPED HIM OFF
AT HIS DADDY'S
AND KEPT GOING.

32:18.937 --> 32:22.592
WHY? WHY LEAVE
YOUR BABY BEHIND?

32:22.636 --> 32:25.160
THAT WASN'T MY PLAN.

32:25.204 --> 32:27.467
BUT STEVE'S MOM AND DAD,
THEY DIDN'T WANT NOTHING

32:27.510 --> 32:29.077
TO DO WITH ME
OR MY FAMILY.

32:29.121 --> 32:31.645
THEY KNEW MY MOM AND DAD
WERE KIND OF CRAZY.

32:31.688 --> 32:33.603
AND THE BABY WAS
THEIR GRANDSON, TOO.

32:33.647 --> 32:36.041
THEY SAID THEY'D TAKE
HIM AND RAISE HIM PROPER,

32:36.084 --> 32:38.739
BUT ONLY IF I WENT AWAY.

32:38.782 --> 32:40.959
SO I LEFT.

32:43.570 --> 32:45.615
WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT?

32:45.659 --> 32:49.271
IN WAS IN THE EVIDENCE BOX
FROM THE MILBURN CRIME SCENE.

32:49.315 --> 32:52.231
CRIME SCENE? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

32:56.975 --> 33:00.369
LEEANNE, SHORTLY AFTER
YOU RAN AWAY,

33:00.413 --> 33:02.415
THE MILBURN FAMILY
WAS KILLED.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.678
MY BABY?

33:04.721 --> 33:06.506
HE WASN'T THERE.

33:06.549 --> 33:10.249
THERE WAS THE MOTHER,
THE FATHER, AND STEVE.

33:10.292 --> 33:12.294
POLICE RULED IT
A MURDER-SUICIDE.

33:12.338 --> 33:14.644
LEWIS: EXCEPT THAT IT WASN'T.

33:14.688 --> 33:17.299
WE BELIEVE THAT YOUR FATHER
CAME LOOKING FOR HIS GRANDSON

33:17.343 --> 33:20.085
AND THEN TOOK HIM
BY FORCE.

33:20.128 --> 33:22.000
TOOK HIM?

33:23.262 --> 33:25.525
YOU MEAN MY LITTLE BOY
GREW UP WITH THEM,

33:25.568 --> 33:28.745
IN THAT HOUSE?

33:28.789 --> 33:31.226
WHERE IS HE NOW?

33:32.706 --> 33:34.882
NO.

33:34.925 --> 33:37.058
PLEASE.

33:37.102 --> 33:38.668
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO THIS.

33:38.712 --> 33:39.974
GRANDPA KNEW.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.367
KNEW WHAT?

33:41.410 --> 33:43.064
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

33:43.108 --> 33:45.371
WHEN YOU LEFT,

33:45.414 --> 33:48.069
GRANDPA SAID GRANDMA GOT...

33:48.113 --> 33:50.593
REALLY, REALLY SAD.

33:53.292 --> 33:55.598
HE WANTED HER
TO GET BETTER,

33:57.339 --> 33:59.211
LIKE SHE USED TO BE.

34:01.169 --> 34:04.085
HE FOUND OTHERS, BUT...

34:04.129 --> 34:07.175
BUT HE HAD TO MAKE SURE
THEY DIDN'T RUN AWAY.

34:12.137 --> 34:15.053
BOY: DON'T BE SAD,
GRANDMA.

34:20.754 --> 34:22.930
THEN GRANDPA DIED.

34:24.323 --> 34:25.585
I TRIED TO FIND
THE OTHER ONES, TOO,

34:25.628 --> 34:28.240
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.

34:30.111 --> 34:31.852
IT WASN'T THE SAME.

34:36.030 --> 34:38.728
THAT WON'T HAPPEN TO ME.

34:52.177 --> 34:54.048
AAH!

34:56.790 --> 34:58.966
[UNSUB COUGHING
AND GASPING]

35:34.262 --> 35:36.308
AAH! AAH!

35:36.351 --> 35:38.223
AAH!

35:42.531 --> 35:45.099
SO WE KNOW WHO AND WHY
BUT NOT WHERE.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.101
WELL, THE UNSUB
WOULDN'T GO FAR FROM
WHERE HE GREW UP.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.842
ALL OF THE TRAUMA
IS ROOTED THERE.

35:48.885 --> 35:51.758
OK, WELL, LETTERS
THE VICTIMS WROTE
THEIR LOVED ONES...

35:51.801 --> 35:53.020
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT THEM?

35:53.063 --> 35:54.717
WELL, SEVERAL TALKED
ABOUT A POND

35:54.761 --> 35:56.632
WHERE KARL TOOK THEM
FISHING.

35:56.676 --> 36:00.158
RECREATING WHAT HE MUST
HAVE DONE WITH LEEANNE.

36:01.681 --> 36:02.812
FISHING?

36:02.856 --> 36:04.945
JJ: IN A POND
SOMEWHERE NEAR YOUR HOUSE.

36:04.988 --> 36:07.948
YEAH, I MEAN, MY DAD
TOOK ME FISHING
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

36:07.991 --> 36:10.646
WHERE WAS IT?
THERE'S NO POND ON
YOUR FAMILY'S PROPERTY.

36:10.690 --> 36:12.170
I KNOW. WE HAD
TO DRIVE THERE.

36:12.213 --> 36:13.649
WHICH DIRECTION?I DON'T KNOW.

36:13.693 --> 36:15.303
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE
YOU TO GET THERE?

36:15.347 --> 36:18.437
15 MINUTES, MAYBE.
IT WAS NEXT TO
AN EMPTY CABIN.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.221
THERE WAS
A BRIDGE NEARBY.
WHY DO YOU WANT--

36:20.265 --> 36:21.657
GARCIA.

36:21.701 --> 36:24.007
GARCIA: HOLD ON.

36:24.051 --> 36:26.227
GOT IT.
SENDING COORDINATES NOW.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.229
ROSSI AND SIMMONS ARE
OUT AT THE ELGIN CRIME SCENE.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.188
THEY'RE CLOSER THAN WE ARE.
WE'LL PROVIDE BACKUP.

36:30.231 --> 36:32.233
DAVE...

36:32.277 --> 36:34.670
ROSSI: I'LL SECURE THE BACK.

37:04.091 --> 37:07.573
ROSSI, HE'S IN
THE CENTER OF THE ROOM.

37:07.616 --> 37:09.009
HE'S ALONE.

37:09.052 --> 37:10.053
COPY.

37:10.097 --> 37:11.054
I'M AT THE REAR
ENTRANCE.

37:11.098 --> 37:12.708
ANY SIGN OF
MARY BREWER?

37:12.752 --> 37:14.232
NEGATIVE.

37:14.275 --> 37:16.234
WE BREACH ON 3.

37:19.672 --> 37:23.806
1, 2, 3.

37:23.850 --> 37:25.808
FBI!

37:25.852 --> 37:27.984
PUT YOUR HANDS UP.

37:28.028 --> 37:30.857
HANDS UP! NOW!

37:36.254 --> 37:38.081
WHERE'S MARY BREWER?

37:43.478 --> 37:45.219
NEED AN AMBULANCE
TO THE LOCATION.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.307
ROSSI: MARY!

37:49.919 --> 37:52.270
MARY BREWER!

38:04.238 --> 38:05.457
NO SIGN OF HER.

38:05.500 --> 38:08.503
WHERE IS SHE?

38:08.547 --> 38:11.767
MARY!

38:25.259 --> 38:27.217
YOU'RE OK.
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

38:27.261 --> 38:30.395
UNSUB: NO! NO! NO!

38:33.354 --> 38:36.009
NO, LEAVE HER
WHERE SHE WAS.

38:36.052 --> 38:39.229
SHE BELONGS WITH ME.

38:39.273 --> 38:41.275
IT'S OK, IT'S OK.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.844
YOU'RE SAFE.
YOU'RE SAFE.

38:49.152 --> 38:52.939
SO ALL THIS IS
BECAUSE THE ELGINS'
DAUGHTER RAN OFF?

38:52.982 --> 38:54.680
KARL SAW THE EFFECT
IT HAD ON HIS WIFE,

38:54.723 --> 38:56.377
SO HE WENT OUT,
FOUND THOSE GIRLS

38:56.421 --> 38:59.162
IN AN ATTEMPT
TO PULL DOROTHY OUT
OF HER TAILSPIN.

38:59.206 --> 39:02.165
HE SURROUNDED HER
WITH SUBSTITUTE LEEANNES

39:02.209 --> 39:04.254
IN THE WALL,
UNDER THE FLOOR,

39:04.298 --> 39:05.734
BASICALLY ENCIRCLING HER.

39:05.778 --> 39:07.432
AND THEIR GRANDSON TRIED
TO DO THE SAME THING FOR HER

39:07.475 --> 39:08.650
ONCE KARL DIED.

39:08.694 --> 39:11.653
IS THIS A NORMAL
CASE FOR YOU FOLKS?

39:11.697 --> 39:13.046
NONE OF THEM ARE NORMAL.

39:14.439 --> 39:15.265
SHERIFF:
WELL, DR. REID,
I CAN SAY IT WAS

39:15.309 --> 39:17.224
A PLEASURE TALKING
TO YOU.

39:17.267 --> 39:19.618
I'M GONNA GIVE THAT
TREE IN THE FOREST
THING SOME MORE THOUGHT.

39:19.661 --> 39:20.836
DON'T GIVE IT
TOO MUCH THOUGHT.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.838
IT'S BASICALLY
AN INFALLIBLE CONJECTURE.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.666
COPY THAT.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.799
WELL, THANKS AGAIN.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.670
UH, EMILY, I NEED
TO GO TO NEW YORK

39:28.714 --> 39:30.237
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.
WOULD THAT BE ALL RIGHT?

39:30.280 --> 39:32.370
AFTER THE WRENCH
I THREW IN YOUR VACATION

39:32.413 --> 39:36.374
WITH MY QUICK DETOUR,
TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU WANT.

39:38.201 --> 39:39.159
COMING?

39:39.202 --> 39:40.552
UH, YEAH, YEAH.
IN A MINUTE.

39:40.595 --> 39:42.597
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO DO.

39:49.996 --> 39:51.650
HEY.

39:52.999 --> 39:56.002
UM...

39:56.045 --> 39:58.396
I THINK THAT WAS
MEANT FOR YOU.

40:19.199 --> 40:22.376
JJ, VOICE-OVER:
"WITHOUT A FAMILY,
MAN, ALONE IN THE WORLD

40:22.420 --> 40:24.247
TREMBLES WITH THE COLD."

40:24.291 --> 40:26.380
ANDRE MAUROIS.

40:30.819 --> 40:33.387
ROSSI: THIS ONE'S PRETTY
GOOD, HUH

40:33.431 --> 40:35.345
THANK YOU.YOU'RE WELCOME.

40:35.389 --> 40:36.825
PORTIA: THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

40:36.869 --> 40:38.305
MY PLEASURE.

40:38.348 --> 40:40.481
WE DIDN'T INVITE YOU HERE
JUST TO PICK UP THE TAB.

40:40.525 --> 40:41.787
YEAH, WELL,
DON'T YOU WORRY,

40:41.830 --> 40:43.484
YOU'LL ALL BE GETTING
INVOICES IN THE MAIL.

40:44.572 --> 40:46.269
IT WAS GREAT
MEETING YOU, SIR.

40:46.313 --> 40:47.532
I LOVED YOUR STORIES.

40:47.575 --> 40:49.490
YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY
WRITE A BOOK.

40:49.534 --> 40:52.493
YOU KNOW,
I JUST MAY DO THAT.

40:52.537 --> 40:54.495
I'M GONNA START
HUNTING A CAB.

40:54.539 --> 40:56.323
SATURDAY NIGHTS
ARE TOUGH.

40:56.366 --> 40:57.455
YOU DON'T RIDE SHARE?

40:57.498 --> 40:59.500
NO, SCOTT DOESN'T LIKE
TO DOWNLOAD APPS.

40:59.544 --> 41:02.024
THIS GUY'S JUST GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER.

41:02.068 --> 41:05.550
OK, SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS
THINK OF SCOTT?

41:05.593 --> 41:06.768
HONESTLY.

41:06.812 --> 41:08.988
HONESTLY?

41:09.031 --> 41:10.729
I THINK HE'S
TERRIFIC.

41:10.772 --> 41:13.427
YOU DO?
I DO.

41:13.471 --> 41:16.299
I KNOW HE'S NOT
UP-TO-DATE ON TRUE
CRIME AUTHORS,

41:16.343 --> 41:20.303
BUT WE JUST--WE CLICK.

41:20.347 --> 41:22.697
TAXI'S WAITING.

41:26.875 --> 41:29.399
I LOVE YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU.

41:31.924 --> 41:35.623
AS YOU CAN SEE,
PORTIA'S OVER HER
DAVID ROSSI ISSUES.

41:35.667 --> 41:37.625
AND I WASN'T KIDDING
ABOUT HER NEW GUY.

41:37.669 --> 41:39.497
SCOTT'S GREAT.

41:42.891 --> 41:46.547
IT WAS IMPORTANT
FOR PORTIA TO
HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

41:46.591 --> 41:50.943
I THINK THAT'S WHY SHE CALLED
YOU TO COME TO NEW YORK.

41:50.986 --> 41:55.469
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO STEP IN
AS SUBSTITUTE FATHER?

41:55.513 --> 41:57.340
I'M FLATTERED,

41:57.384 --> 41:59.517
THOUGH THE IRONY OF
ANYONE ASKING ME

41:59.560 --> 42:01.562
FOR ROMANTIC ADVICE...

42:01.606 --> 42:04.217
YOU'VE HAD YOUR SHARE
OF ROMANCE.

42:04.260 --> 42:07.176
THERE'S BEEN AT LEAST 3 WOMEN

42:07.220 --> 42:09.744
THAT SAW YOU AS
HUSBAND MATERIAL.

42:09.788 --> 42:12.442
YEAH, WELL, WE'VE ALL
SEEN HOW THAT TURNED OUT.

42:12.486 --> 42:14.140
HAVE WE?

42:16.359 --> 42:20.799
WELL, THAT'S A SUBJECT
THAT BEARS FURTHER
DISCUSSION.
