WEBVTT

00:50.551 --> 00:51.635
Helly leave?

00:51.718 --> 00:52.719
Yeah.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.935
Maybe you should get out of here.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.522
I know. Just wrapping up.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.232
Sorry, I love the work.

01:29.464 --> 01:30.507
Jesus.

01:33.719 --> 01:34.720
Help!

01:37.014 --> 01:38.348
Help!

01:41.602 --> 01:43.270
Goddamn it!

01:46.982 --> 01:48.358
Oh, my God.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.329
Is she okay?

02:03.540 --> 02:04.541
Helly?

02:06.043 --> 02:08.628
-Mark, get in the elevator.
-Helly? Helly!

02:08.711 --> 02:09.963
Get in the elevator!

02:17.554 --> 02:18.805
Is she okay?

02:35.447 --> 02:37.741
-Judd.
-Mr. Scout, you have a good evening.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.159
Will do. Same to you.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.116
Is she alive?

04:44.743 --> 04:46.286
Have a seat, Mark.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.510
She's in the hospital.

05:02.511 --> 05:07.307
She has severe bruising but,
thankfully, no permanent damage.

05:07.391 --> 05:08.600
Okay.

05:08.684 --> 05:11.812
Okay, so you-- You're letting her go?

05:11.895 --> 05:14.189
Helly's outie has
no intention of resigning--

05:14.273 --> 05:16.108
She almost died.
She doesn't wanna be here.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.569
And she will be back at her desk
in a few days.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.903
Is that enough time?

05:22.322 --> 05:26.243
This happened on your watch, Mark S.

05:30.205 --> 05:34.710
And you can thank Kier himself
it went the way it did.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.337
Have a productive day.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.496
What is it to fail?

06:12.956 --> 06:16.919
My failure to break into the literary
world in my 20s was devastating,

06:17.002 --> 06:18.837
yet it taught me a vital lesson.

06:19.546 --> 06:24.468
That it was not me who was wrong,
but literature itself.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.388
And that to truly find
my place in that world,

06:28.472 --> 06:31.475
I would first need to break it entirely.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.810
And so I did.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.980
A society with festering workers
cannot flourish,

06:37.689 --> 06:41.193
just as a man with rotting toes
cannot skip.

06:43.612 --> 06:48.825
What separates man from machine is that
machines cannot think for themselves.

06:49.826 --> 06:53.705
Also, they are made of metal,
whereas man is made of skin.

06:53.789 --> 06:56.667
If you are a soldier,
do not fight for my freedom.

06:57.668 --> 07:01.171
Fight for the freedom
of the soldier fighting next to you.

07:02.256 --> 07:05.509
This will make the war more inspiring
for you both.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.137
A good person will follow the rules.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.140
A great person will follow himself.

07:12.224 --> 07:16.436
Bullies are nothing but Bull and Lies.

07:16.937 --> 07:21.233
At the center of "Industry" is "Dust."

07:21.316 --> 07:26.363
They cannot crucify you
if your hand is in a fist.

07:27.531 --> 07:31.535
Should you find yourself contorting
to fit a system, dear reader,

07:32.911 --> 07:36.999
stop and ask if
it's truly you that must change

07:37.583 --> 07:38.959
or the system.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.839
Ran the diagnostics.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.883
And?

07:46.592 --> 07:50.095
Full synaptic coupling.
Petey Kilmer's memory was reintegrated.

07:52.264 --> 07:53.432
You were right, Harmony.

07:55.017 --> 07:56.435
We should celebrate.

08:01.857 --> 08:04.151
I figure you'll take a beat
before telling the Board,

08:04.234 --> 08:06.153
especially after
what happened with Helly R.

08:09.198 --> 08:11.408
Jesus. You haven't told them.

08:14.745 --> 08:17.414
Comb the chip data for source signatures.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.083
It's saved, so you can keep it.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.129
A gift.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.382
Please find out who did this.

08:27.966 --> 08:31.011
I'd like to deliver everything
to the Board at once.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.731
Oh, shit.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.232
Hi, Mark, it's Ricken.

08:44.316 --> 08:47.694
Listen, I know you're still
in severed Mark form,

08:47.778 --> 08:51.740
but Devon's at 4 centimeters,
so this baby is officially coming.

08:51.823 --> 08:55.619
We're headed to the birthing retreat now,
so please come.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.538
Mark, Ricken again.

08:57.621 --> 09:00.874
We're at the retreat, and the child
is continuing toward the birth canal,

09:00.958 --> 09:03.502
so it would be really great
if you were here.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.421
I don't know if they let you
have your phone down there--

09:06.922 --> 09:10.050
Actually, if this is Mark's work self,

09:10.133 --> 09:12.678
please tell him
Ricken said to come quickly.

09:12.761 --> 09:16.014
Mark, we're still here.
Wondering if you're lost.

09:16.098 --> 09:17.724
We are in cabin six,

09:17.808 --> 09:20.227
which is through the gate
and at the end of the row.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.896
It's one of the more
affordably sized units,

09:22.980 --> 09:24.606
but you should be able to find it.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.275
Please do come soon.

09:35.826 --> 09:36.994
Hey.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.453
Hey. Hey.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.749
Did you forget that I was gonna be here?

09:45.294 --> 09:46.295
Slightly.

09:49.464 --> 09:53.218
Look, I'm sorry about the other night. I…

09:53.927 --> 09:55.512
Yeah, no, it's fine.

09:56.722 --> 09:57.723
Yeah.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.976
-She's doing great, by the way.
-Yeah?

10:01.059 --> 10:01.894
-Yeah.
-Okay.

10:01.977 --> 10:05.063
The contractions are about
20 minutes apart,

10:05.147 --> 10:06.607
so we still have some time.

10:07.608 --> 10:10.861
Ricken is doing this thing
where he cries over her.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.030
So, I'm--

10:13.947 --> 10:16.074
I'm giving them some privacy.

10:19.578 --> 10:20.787
Sounds good.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.628
Hey, thank you for,
you know, taking care of her.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.756
Yeah. Of course.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.226
Babe, I just don't wanna be
like my father.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.687
I know, baby. I think it's good
you're getting it out now.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.148
It's okay.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.901
Hey. I'm looking for baby camp?

10:53.779 --> 10:55.656
The uncle-to-be. Welcome, Mark.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.616
Yay! I'm so glad you're here.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.160
I didn't know if they were gonna
wake you up from work or whatever.

11:00.244 --> 11:02.621
Oh, no, I just saw the message
when I got off. Sorry.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.498
No, it's been pretty boring so far.

11:05.207 --> 11:09.419
All right.
Well, glad to be here in this cozy nook.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.171
-Wow.
-Dude, did you see the one next door?

11:11.255 --> 11:14.174
-Yeah.
-It's, like, psychotically expensive.

11:14.258 --> 11:16.552
It's like a freakin' lodge.
I hate whoever's in there.

11:16.635 --> 11:19.263
It's just fat cats making fat kittens.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.347
Yeah.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.141
Oh, shit.

11:23.225 --> 11:24.226
It's a contraction.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.271
-Fuck.
-Mark, say a secret quickly.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.897
He doesn't have to, babe.

11:29.481 --> 11:32.234
-What?
-The fetus is drawn to clear air.

11:32.317 --> 11:35.654
Purging secrets can create a soul void
that speeds the labor.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.239
Okay, and we want that?

11:37.322 --> 11:39.157
-We do.
-Hey, baby, not right now.

11:39.241 --> 11:42.452
It's fine, I'll start. Mark…

11:43.537 --> 11:45.664
I love you, and I feel hurt
that you haven't called me

11:45.747 --> 11:47.165
to thank me for the book yet.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.210
-There. Good.
-The book?

11:50.294 --> 11:53.005
We left a copy of his new book
on your doorstep.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.841
Five days ago. Five full days.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.468
Okay, well,
I definitely haven't seen that.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.721
I mean, it must've been stolen
or something. I--

12:00.804 --> 12:03.473
What? That was an advanced copy.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.268
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.521
-Are you okay?
-Oh, my God.

12:10.606 --> 12:11.607
I'm okay.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.233
It's fine. It's all fine.

12:16.612 --> 12:20.490
Okay, okay. I'm okay. Are you okay?

12:20.574 --> 12:21.700
Okay.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.744
-I'm good.
-Yeah?

12:24.453 --> 12:26.830
-Yeah, I'm gonna go get coffee.
-Really?

12:27.497 --> 12:29.499
Yeah. I think. I'm gonna get going.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.461
-Are you sure?
-Thank you. Thanks, bud.

12:34.046 --> 12:35.589
-All right. I'll be back.
-Yeah.

12:35.672 --> 12:36.965
Okay. Be careful.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.601
Well, this is good.
We can finish setting up the room.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.526
Mark, would you help me hang the kelp?

12:56.944 --> 12:58.529
Hang the kelp? Why?

12:59.905 --> 13:01.532
Do you really want me to explain it?

13:13.293 --> 13:14.294
Hi.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.178
Hi. Excuse me?

13:24.263 --> 13:25.264
Sir?

13:26.139 --> 13:27.140
Sir--

13:30.811 --> 13:31.937
Hey.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.566
What the fuck, man? Oh, my Go--

13:37.192 --> 13:39.778
Hi, I'm so sorry.
I'm another pregnant lady.

13:39.862 --> 13:42.739
I'm from over there.
I just came out on a coffee run,

13:42.823 --> 13:45.742
and I got distracted
by your beautiful coffee,

13:45.826 --> 13:48.537
and I was wondering if there's any chance
you could hook me up.

13:51.373 --> 13:52.374
Okay.

13:52.457 --> 13:55.460
Yeah? Yes. Thank you. Thank Christ.

13:59.298 --> 14:00.799
Hi. Thank you so much.

14:01.550 --> 14:03.051
I'm gonna squeeze right past you.

14:09.641 --> 14:10.642
I'm Devon.

14:11.185 --> 14:12.311
Gabby.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.229
Thank you for narcotics.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.649
My husband is driving me fucking crazy.

14:18.192 --> 14:21.737
My brother's… depressing me.

14:24.448 --> 14:25.699
Is it your first?

14:26.450 --> 14:27.743
Yeah. Yours?

14:28.535 --> 14:29.745
My third.

14:30.662 --> 14:31.997
I'm naming him William.

14:32.664 --> 14:36.043
Three kiddos. I'm so fucking scared
of ruining one child.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.545
How do you handle it?

14:39.254 --> 14:41.590
-Lotta help, I guess.
-Yeah.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.511
Holy shit, by the way,
how about this cabin? It's so nice.

14:46.303 --> 14:47.346
Are you rich?

14:54.144 --> 14:58.273
Because really…
if the thief reads the book,

14:58.357 --> 14:59.650
it will have been worth it.

15:00.359 --> 15:03.487
In fact, I bet you
he turns himself in afterward.

15:05.739 --> 15:10.577
Listen, I know the last time you were
in a medical facility was for Gemma.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.581
Is that what this is? A medical facility?

15:16.792 --> 15:20.420
Of course, the baby's middle name could've
been so lovely a tribute to her, but…

15:21.672 --> 15:24.508
I understand you were unable
to be comfortable with it.

15:25.050 --> 15:28.637
Your kid deserves her own name
without some…

15:29.805 --> 15:31.890
big, feely baggage.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.276
Yes.

15:55.289 --> 15:56.456
I got coffee.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.210
Toll, please.

16:02.004 --> 16:05.632
I made friends
with the richest lady in baby camp.

16:06.884 --> 16:07.926
She was…

16:08.802 --> 16:10.345
quiet, but she was nice.

16:11.013 --> 16:13.557
Very cute. I should send you up there.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.435
I'd imagine she's spoken for.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.064
I bet Alexa would give you another shot.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.776
I bet she wouldn't.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.280
-I bet you could ask her.
-Okay.

16:30.532 --> 16:33.327
You okay? Do you want me to go get her?

16:33.410 --> 16:35.954
No, no, no. Hold on,
can I squeeze your hand?

16:36.038 --> 16:37.748
Yeah. There we go.

16:38.582 --> 16:39.708
All right.

16:43.212 --> 16:46.131
-Need me to tell a secret?
-Yeah, go ahead.

16:46.215 --> 16:47.883
Give me your dark shit.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.052
Well, so…

17:00.187 --> 17:04.566
I kinda think Lumon might be
up to something.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.903
What do you mean?
Like, with your paychecks?

17:08.904 --> 17:13.407
No, I've just been hearing stuff.
Just around.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.452
Who've you been talking to?

17:17.829 --> 17:19.122
So…

17:23.085 --> 17:24.086
What?

17:26.046 --> 17:27.839
Do you remember the businessman?

17:32.803 --> 17:35.305
Holy fucking pit of hell!

17:35.389 --> 17:36.932
Okay. Darling, you okay?

17:37.808 --> 17:39.726
-Why do people do this?
-I'll go get Alexa.

17:39.810 --> 17:42.771
-Great.
-Don't touch me, baby.

17:42.855 --> 17:43.856
Okay.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.150
-One more big push.
-Oh, my God.

17:47.234 --> 17:50.404
She's right here.
She's right here. You're doing so great.

17:50.487 --> 17:54.241
-It hurts.
-I know it hurts but she's right here.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.994
-I can see her. She's crowning. Okay?
-Oh, my God.

17:57.077 --> 18:01.707
All right, now. You know,
I can see her. Here she comes.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.732
-Oh, my God.
-She's coming.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.234
Oh, my God.

18:29.318 --> 18:31.236
Oh, my God.

18:33.238 --> 18:36.074
Thank you.
She did great. I'm gonna pass out.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.620
She was in outie form
at the time she woke up.

18:39.703 --> 18:44.041
So this will be innie Helly's first
conscious experience since the hanging.

18:46.001 --> 18:49.880
When she sees you,
it's important your eyes be kind.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.427
Do you know how to make your eyes kind?

19:39.805 --> 19:41.181
You're okay.

19:42.683 --> 19:45.435
You're okay. It's all right.

19:58.866 --> 20:05.289
So they locked away the extension cords
and other dangerous items so, you know,

20:06.373 --> 20:07.583
you should be safe.

20:12.754 --> 20:16.258
And if you wanna focus on looking for
happy numbers for a while, that's fine.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.348
Yeah.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.523
Do you wanna talk about it?

20:46.079 --> 20:49.291
We should hide
inspirational handbook quotes

20:49.374 --> 20:53.587
around the office for her to stumble upon.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.632
She just needs
to start earning perks, dude.

20:56.715 --> 20:59.259
I'd end my life
if I didn't have any finger traps yet.

20:59.801 --> 21:02.262
You know, what one of us should do
is lend her our trap

21:02.346 --> 21:04.181
until she has one of her own.

21:05.098 --> 21:08.060
Yeah, but not me though
'cause I already contributed the idea.

21:08.143 --> 21:09.394
It's only fair.

21:11.688 --> 21:12.689
Ms. Casey.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.859
I'm here to observe Helly R.

21:17.861 --> 21:19.029
No one told me.

21:19.655 --> 21:24.117
Ms. Cobel's orders.
I am to watch her for signs of sadness,

21:24.201 --> 21:27.746
and verbally encourage her
to forgo further suicide attempts.

21:27.829 --> 21:30.207
Upon request, I can also perform a hug.

21:31.124 --> 21:34.837
You know I've been exhibiting signs
of sadness. Could I get one of those?

21:34.920 --> 21:35.838
No.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.535
Did you get all that?

22:09.162 --> 22:10.414
Are you upset?

22:11.456 --> 22:14.877
No. I'm peachy.

22:17.671 --> 22:19.423
If you're upset, you can request a--

22:19.506 --> 22:23.468
A hug. I know. I'm good.

23:15.229 --> 23:16.355
Irv.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.194
We lose you again there, buddy?

23:26.823 --> 23:27.824
Irv?

23:28.325 --> 23:30.327
I have to go to O&D.

23:32.037 --> 23:33.330
Something's come up.

23:35.582 --> 23:39.253
And I'd like to seek Burt's counsel.

23:40.754 --> 23:41.755
Well…

23:44.299 --> 23:48.220
Okay, fine. Just make a copy of that map
in case we have to come find you.

24:12.744 --> 24:13.745
Oh, God.

24:26.300 --> 24:29.011
Oh, no. I'm sorry, Irving.

24:29.553 --> 24:32.681
We must have sent this print job here by
mistake. You weren't supposed to see this.

24:32.764 --> 24:33.974
What are these?

24:34.641 --> 24:38.020
Nothing. A joke for Ms. Cobel.

24:39.021 --> 24:44.484
It's the O&D coup, isn't it?
The one that Dylan talks about, huh?

24:46.904 --> 24:51.950
Did that actually happen, Mr. Milchick?

24:52.034 --> 24:56.330
Of course not.
Nothing like that could happen here.

25:00.167 --> 25:02.044
It's proof. It is ironclad proof.

25:02.127 --> 25:04.254
Milchick says it didn't happen.

25:04.338 --> 25:07.424
And why would one department
physically attack another?

25:07.508 --> 25:10.344
Lumon wouldn't just then give them
all the other department's resources.

25:10.427 --> 25:13.388
Does O&D know that?
Are we even sure about it?

25:13.472 --> 25:16.725
Because with seven people,
there is a lot that they could do to us.

25:18.727 --> 25:20.312
-I could ask--
-Your new friend,

25:20.395 --> 25:23.023
who lied to you
about the size of his department?

25:23.106 --> 25:25.150
How do we know
what else he isn't being kosher about?

25:39.957 --> 25:43.627
You ran a 266 on Irving B.?

25:44.545 --> 25:46.755
Yeah. Just now.

25:51.134 --> 25:54.471
I thought it might dissuade him
from spending so much time with Burt G.

25:58.892 --> 26:01.144
I'm sorry. Should I have consulted you?

26:03.522 --> 26:05.899
No, no. Good initiative.

26:09.570 --> 26:11.238
I saw Ms. Casey down there.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.950
You're having her watch Helly R.

26:16.118 --> 26:17.119
I am.

26:18.412 --> 26:20.372
May I ask why?

26:20.998 --> 26:27.379
"The light of discovery shines truer
upon a virgin meadow than a beaten path."

26:33.802 --> 26:37.514
I'm trying something new with Ms. Casey.

26:41.059 --> 26:42.728
Keep it between us.

26:47.858 --> 26:48.859
Right.

27:37.533 --> 27:38.742
Helly R.

27:39.868 --> 27:41.203
Hi, Ms. Casey.

27:42.246 --> 27:44.581
Please describe for me
your time in the restroom.

27:45.666 --> 27:52.548
Oh, no. I'm so sorry, Ms. Casey.
I just-- I turned and--

27:52.631 --> 27:55.843
Bet you're drunk. What'd your mouth
taste like when you got in today?

27:57.261 --> 28:00.389
Helly R., you have to come with me
to distribution supply.

28:00.472 --> 28:03.517
That's okay.
I can watch Helly R. while you're gone.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.269
It's only a few minutes, right?

28:05.352 --> 28:08.981
Distribution supply is eight minutes,
round trip.

28:21.034 --> 28:24.663
You know, I go to distribution supply
all the time, so I could-- If you--

28:28.125 --> 28:30.252
Well, that's one less horrible thing.

28:31.670 --> 28:33.589
For eight minutes anyway.

28:35.174 --> 28:39.720
Helly, I just realized I haven't shown you
where we keep the extra pen caps.

28:41.013 --> 28:42.222
It's not far. Do you mind?

28:43.390 --> 28:45.726
I'm good, thanks.

28:46.435 --> 28:49.688
Nah, you're right. We shouldn't go
anywhere without Ms. Casey.

28:58.238 --> 28:59.531
Careful out there, boss.

29:00.741 --> 29:02.326
Weird energy about.

29:31.939 --> 29:33.690
So where are all these pen caps at?

29:35.943 --> 29:37.236
How are you doing, Helly?

29:37.945 --> 29:40.697
Jesus. Did you make up the pen caps
to ask me that?

29:40.781 --> 29:42.366
Well, I just wanted to talk.

29:44.535 --> 29:45.953
I'm really bad, Mark.

29:47.538 --> 29:48.622
Thanks for noticing.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.167
Come here.

29:59.174 --> 30:00.217
Come on.

30:14.314 --> 30:15.357
Here.

30:18.694 --> 30:19.778
Petey's map.

30:20.779 --> 30:23.866
Yeah. Since you've been gone, I've been
trying to recreate it on my lunch breaks.

30:24.491 --> 30:25.492
And…

30:26.326 --> 30:29.037
I thought maybe
if we work on it together, we can…

30:31.081 --> 30:32.291
you know.

30:33.625 --> 30:35.002
I'm not your new Petey.

30:47.139 --> 30:48.182
Helly.

30:51.185 --> 30:52.227
Helly R.?

30:54.146 --> 30:57.065
-Mark took her to look at pen caps.
-Where?

30:58.150 --> 30:59.818
-Now?
-They're fine.

30:59.902 --> 31:02.237
Just at the end of the storage wing.

31:08.076 --> 31:09.870
Burt G. is in the conference room.

31:26.386 --> 31:27.387
Burt.

31:29.556 --> 31:30.557
Irving.

31:33.393 --> 31:34.853
What are you doing here?

31:35.729 --> 31:39.483
You know, I was turned around.

31:40.234 --> 31:41.235
Actually, I--

31:42.611 --> 31:45.822
I was looking for you.
I hadn't heard from you.

31:51.119 --> 31:52.371
Well, I--

31:53.205 --> 31:54.998
-Dylan! Oh, my God! What are--
-Irving.

31:55.082 --> 31:56.208
What are you doing?

31:56.291 --> 31:57.876
-He was coming at you.
-Let him out!

31:57.960 --> 31:59.628
-Out? Why the fuck is he here?
-Let him out!

31:59.711 --> 32:01.046
-What's wrong with you?
-You saw that painting.

32:01.129 --> 32:03.006
You want to get disemboweled today?

32:03.090 --> 32:04.675
Hey, where's your friends? Plural.

32:04.758 --> 32:07.344
As in, the six fucking people
you've been hiding from us.

32:07.427 --> 32:09.012
Oh, my word. I--

32:09.096 --> 32:10.973
I need a manager!

32:11.056 --> 32:12.391
Irving, wait. Don't go.

32:12.474 --> 32:14.351
-I-- We--
-I know what you're up to.

32:14.434 --> 32:17.354
-What is wrong with you? Open the door.
-Manager!

32:17.437 --> 32:18.647
Open the door.

32:18.730 --> 32:21.316
-We need a manager. We need a manager.
-Irving!

32:21.400 --> 32:22.776
Irving!

32:24.862 --> 32:25.863
Helly?

32:31.743 --> 32:32.744
Helly.

32:35.330 --> 32:36.582
Helly.

32:41.795 --> 32:43.130
Where the fuck are we?

32:43.839 --> 32:45.966
Look, don't you want to get these to--

32:46.049 --> 32:48.969
I told her I wanted out,
and she told me I wasn't a person.

32:49.678 --> 32:51.305
My own self told me that.

32:51.388 --> 32:55.851
Yeah, and that's horrible.
But don't focus on her.

32:56.727 --> 32:59.938
What do you want? In here?

33:01.523 --> 33:06.028
What I want is for her to wake up
while the life drains out of her

33:06.111 --> 33:07.821
and to know it was me who did it.

33:19.416 --> 33:21.585
-If I could just explain--
-Save it, marauder.

33:21.668 --> 33:24.254
I checked the whole storage wing.
No sign of him or Helly.

33:24.338 --> 33:26.340
Shit. O&D has probably
killed them already.

33:26.423 --> 33:27.966
Irving, what?

33:28.634 --> 33:33.138
Our department chief and new hire have
gone missing. Do you know where they are?

33:33.222 --> 33:35.349
No, I just came to see you.

33:35.432 --> 33:36.975
And the rest of your department?

33:37.059 --> 33:40.103
They're back in O&D, Irving.
I know I said it was just Felicia and me--

33:40.187 --> 33:43.690
If you came here to see me,
then why are you in the conference room?

33:43.774 --> 33:45.442
Why not come right to the office?

33:45.526 --> 33:48.904
I didn't know why you hadn't been back,
and I didn't wanna scare you again.

33:48.987 --> 33:50.197
Like with the hand thing.

33:51.198 --> 33:52.658
You didn't scare me.

33:52.741 --> 33:56.203
Or embarrass you.
Look, I was working out a joke.

33:56.286 --> 33:57.871
-A joke?
-To say when I got in.

33:57.955 --> 33:59.081
Prove it. Tell it.

33:59.164 --> 34:01.041
I hadn't worked it out yet.

34:05.045 --> 34:09.550
Why did you lie about
the number of people in your department?

34:10.801 --> 34:11.802
Because…

34:14.554 --> 34:15.973
we don't trust your guys.

34:16.056 --> 34:18.891
-You? The king of fucks don't trust us?
-I do.

34:18.976 --> 34:24.106
But people just talk about MDR.
Stupid old stories, jokes even.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.565
What do you mean?

34:25.649 --> 34:26.650
I…

34:28.277 --> 34:32.489
It's literally silly.
Like, they say you all have pouches.

34:32.572 --> 34:36.076
-Pouches? Like to carry young?
-Yes.

34:36.159 --> 34:40.163
According to some,
you each have a larval offspring

34:40.246 --> 34:43.292
that will jump out and attack
if we get too close.

34:43.375 --> 34:44.585
That's fucking psycho.

34:44.668 --> 34:47.629
I mean, it's a joke of course,
but I don't know.

34:47.713 --> 34:50.716
The sentiment, you know, somehow holds.
People are weird.

34:50.799 --> 34:53.342
-Yeah.
-Though, I'd be remiss not to say

34:53.427 --> 34:59.224
that in this theory, the larva
eventually eats and replaces you.

35:00.642 --> 35:03.478
Which, Irving, would solve the mystery…

35:05.189 --> 35:07.065
of your youthful energy.

35:14.740 --> 35:17.034
Irv. Irv?

35:17.117 --> 35:18.952
-Excuse me.
-Where are you going?

35:19.036 --> 35:20.078
Yes?

35:21.163 --> 35:22.581
Are you sweet on this guy?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.043
You disapprove?

35:26.126 --> 35:28.253
I do. I do disapprove.

35:29.004 --> 35:32.090
Certainly the handbook forbids
taking heart to other employees.

35:32.174 --> 35:33.675
Rat-fuck the handbook.

35:33.759 --> 35:37.221
This guy's O and goddamn D,
who are duplicitous snakes to a one.

35:37.304 --> 35:38.472
It's not safe.

36:33.068 --> 36:34.236
They're not ready.

36:35.988 --> 36:37.948
You can't take them yet.
They're not ready.

36:39.741 --> 36:40.909
It isn't time!

36:44.037 --> 36:46.164
-We don't--
-Get the hell out of here.

36:47.666 --> 36:48.959
Go!

36:55.257 --> 36:58.343
"The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design"?

36:58.427 --> 37:00.304
That's what it said.

37:01.054 --> 37:03.473
There's definitely
no painting by that name.

37:03.974 --> 37:06.059
What kind of barbarities were we enacting?

37:06.143 --> 37:08.896
It doesn't matter.
I don't think it was real.

37:09.479 --> 37:13.567
I mean, I'll have to confer with my larva,
of course.

37:17.362 --> 37:23.243
-I'm sorry you had to do this.
-It's all right.

37:23.327 --> 37:25.037
I mean, you know that

37:25.120 --> 37:30.501
relationships beyond the
platonic are frowned upon anyway.

37:33.712 --> 37:35.422
Is that what we are?

37:38.800 --> 37:43.472
Well, Burt G., at this time I

37:43.555 --> 37:48.727
formally release you
from MDR's supervision.

37:49.228 --> 37:52.731
As Kier said, "Be ever merry."

37:55.734 --> 37:56.944
Would you like to come in?

37:58.028 --> 38:01.156
There is something in the storeroom
I'd like to show you.

38:03.742 --> 38:05.285
And Dylan, of course.

38:06.828 --> 38:08.288
No.

38:10.666 --> 38:13.961
The Courtship of Kier and Imogene.

38:14.920 --> 38:19.341
He met his wife
while a stewman in an ether factory.

38:20.801 --> 38:22.719
Damn dumb being here.

38:23.303 --> 38:25.264
She was a swab girl.

38:25.764 --> 38:29.685
The handbook just says they were
bonded by the spirit of industry.

38:30.519 --> 38:34.022
I know,
but if this interpretation is correct,

38:34.106 --> 38:38.652
they met as colleagues.
Took heart to each other as colleagues.

38:47.160 --> 38:52.165
Makes you wonder
how something could be wrong if Kier--

38:52.249 --> 38:55.127
-Get away from him! You lying fuck!
-Dylan, what?

38:55.210 --> 38:56.503
-Dylan!
-He claims he doesn't know

38:56.587 --> 38:59.006
about this painting, meanwhile,
it's sitting on his shelf.

38:59.089 --> 39:01.550
-That isn't.
-Irv, we need to go. Now.

39:02.342 --> 39:03.677
It's not the same.

39:04.344 --> 39:05.888
-What?
-Look.

39:05.971 --> 39:08.599
Look at the badges
the raiders are wearing.

39:08.682 --> 39:12.644
That's not O&D, Dylan. It's us.

39:13.896 --> 39:16.690
This one's never gone
into the hallway rotation.

39:17.316 --> 39:19.818
It's called
"The Macrodata Refinement Calamity."

39:19.902 --> 39:21.653
Okay, but we've never done
anything like that.

39:21.737 --> 39:24.448
Why the hell would there be
two versions of the same painting?

39:37.002 --> 39:39.963
I mean, what if the goats are the numbers?

39:40.047 --> 39:43.509
Like, we're deciding which goats live
and which ones-- Oh, God.

39:43.592 --> 39:44.843
I doubt it's that.

39:44.927 --> 39:45.928
Look…

39:48.055 --> 39:50.891
I know you don't wanna be here. But…

39:52.476 --> 39:54.144
I'm glad you are.

39:55.938 --> 40:00.359
And I'm sorry
that this is the best I can do right now.

40:03.987 --> 40:05.781
If you give me the map, I'll clean it up.

40:09.701 --> 40:11.161
Your drawing is shit.

40:15.916 --> 40:17.918
Hi, Ms. Casey.

40:18.001 --> 40:20.796
We were just heading back
from our mental health walk.

40:21.630 --> 40:23.340
You're both unhurt?

40:24.341 --> 40:25.509
We are.

40:26.760 --> 40:30.472
I'm glad. I was scared.

40:30.973 --> 40:32.099
I'm sorry.

40:33.976 --> 40:35.269
I forgive you.

40:38.564 --> 40:39.898
Okay, then.

40:59.751 --> 41:01.962
You aware what MDR is up to right now?

41:02.045 --> 41:05.174
I thought that's what you were paid for.

41:05.757 --> 41:07.050
You're not stopping it?

41:07.968 --> 41:11.805
"The surest way to tame a prisoner
is to let him believe he's free."

41:12.389 --> 41:14.183
There's a Kier quote for everything.

41:14.266 --> 41:16.226
How many more departments
are you gonna let them find?

41:16.310 --> 41:18.353
I'll have a word with Mark.

41:18.437 --> 41:22.191
I would be careful.
Upstairs wouldn't look kindly on this.

41:23.275 --> 41:24.610
Yes, Daddy.

41:27.905 --> 41:31.450
You can talk to me when you figure out
who hacked Kilmer's chip.

41:41.126 --> 41:43.045
Excuse me, everyone.

41:45.088 --> 41:48.926
I wanna introduce you all
to Irving and Dylan.

41:49.718 --> 41:51.178
They're from MDR.

41:53.847 --> 41:54.932
And they're friends.
