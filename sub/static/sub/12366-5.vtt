WEBVTT

00:05.149 --> 00:06.930
Yes, the strangest thing
just happened to me.

00:06.965 --> 00:10.666
I had a conversation
with a neighbor.

00:10.701 --> 00:14.236
Wow. I never even saw
my neighbors in L.A.

00:14.271 --> 00:16.071
Except during earthquakes.

00:17.139 --> 00:18.984
Yeah, sometimes we'd pull
out of our driveways

00:19.019 --> 00:22.022
at the same time, and as our
electronic gates were opening,

00:22.057 --> 00:24.708
I'd think I don't even
know their names,

00:24.743 --> 00:26.370
and they don't know mine.

00:26.405 --> 00:28.461
And the world was good.

00:30.417 --> 00:32.327
Well, that was the L.A. us.

00:32.362 --> 00:33.577
Here in Cleveland,

00:33.612 --> 00:35.052
we're gonna get to
know our neighbors.

00:35.087 --> 00:36.901
In fact, I'm throwing
a party. Tomorrow.

00:36.936 --> 00:39.723
Look at me being
all spontaneous.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

00:51.133 --> 00:54.147
I changed my hair.

00:56.629 --> 01:00.041
Elka, why would--

01:00.076 --> 01:01.683
I mean, why?

01:01.718 --> 01:04.159
I wanted something fresh.

01:04.194 --> 01:06.167
I found a picture
in a magazine,

01:06.202 --> 01:08.108
and I gave it to
my hair stylist.

01:08.839 --> 01:11.554
Was it a picture of Elmo?

01:13.481 --> 01:16.070
This red hair comes
with a temper.

01:16.105 --> 01:17.255
I will c you.

01:19.183 --> 01:21.623
Okay, red, what's going on?

01:21.658 --> 01:26.003
Max invited me to the
senior senior prom.

01:26.949 --> 01:29.279
That is so cute.

01:29.314 --> 01:33.359
Yeah, if you think piranhas
surrounding a baby seal is cute.

01:34.665 --> 01:37.003
Ah, so the ladies
love Max, huh?

01:37.038 --> 01:39.609
Especially Agnes Bratford.

01:39.644 --> 01:44.557
Or should I say
fat-ass hag-ford.

01:46.330 --> 01:49.036
Well, she doesn't sound
like much of a rival.

01:49.071 --> 01:51.643
She takes hormone
replacements.

01:52.231 --> 01:55.008
I can't compete with
someone who's doping.

01:55.995 --> 01:58.368
I have to take it up a notch.

01:58.403 --> 02:01.076
Now I just need the dress
to make it all pop.

02:02.253 --> 02:04.652
Don't forget the red
nose and floppy shoes.

02:09.598 --> 02:11.501
Oh, my God.
Is that Victoria Chase?

02:11.536 --> 02:12.969
New ringtone?

02:13.004 --> 02:15.904
Don't judge.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.882
- Victoria Chase?
- Oh, it's my Agent.

02:18.917 --> 02:21.988
He sent a text, but I can't read it.
My glasses are upstairs. Can you...

02:22.023 --> 02:23.926
No, a little further.

02:23.961 --> 02:25.195
Good, good.

02:25.230 --> 02:29.604
A Japanese company wants
me to do a commercial.

02:29.639 --> 02:33.212
Years of honing my craft,
and finally my dream is coming true.

02:33.247 --> 02:35.649
Your dream is to do a
Japanese commercial?

02:35.684 --> 02:39.524
No. To sell out for an
obscene amount of money.

02:39.559 --> 02:41.228
What's the product?

02:41.263 --> 02:42.864
Um, I'm not sure.

02:42.899 --> 02:46.170
Beneficial dryness force.

02:46.205 --> 02:48.007
Probably some sort
of antiperspirant.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.243
Oh, that's not so bad.

02:49.278 --> 02:50.712
A lot of a-listers do it.

02:50.747 --> 02:54.185
I heard Brad Pitt did a Japanese
commercial for baby formula.

02:54.220 --> 02:56.824
I know, and now nutrition
breast juice wow

02:56.859 --> 02:59.361
is, like,
the number one brand.

02:59.396 --> 03:02.667
Hey, Elka, you never told us
what your senior prom theme was.

03:02.702 --> 03:03.803
Oh, let me guess--

03:03.838 --> 03:05.505
a night to try to remember?

03:14.223 --> 03:17.293
Let's play a game.

03:17.328 --> 03:20.265
Raise your hand if
you've got a boyfriend.

03:31.785 --> 03:33.287
Cupcakes are up.

03:33.322 --> 03:34.990
Actually, they're Ohio cakes.

03:35.025 --> 03:38.162
See, 'cause they're round on the
ends and high in the middle.

03:38.197 --> 03:41.697
Get it? O-hi-o.

03:42.437 --> 03:45.473
Are you sure you're not
high in the middle?

03:45.508 --> 03:47.310
I just want to make
a good impression.

03:47.345 --> 03:48.612
Look, I got great Lake Latkes.

03:48.647 --> 03:51.851
And I have drew curry

03:51.886 --> 03:53.419
with Lebron rice.

03:53.454 --> 03:54.654
And to wash it all down,

03:54.689 --> 03:57.827
some cold, delicious
Cuyahoga River punch.

03:57.862 --> 04:00.664
You know, that River was so polluted,
it actually caught fire once.

04:00.699 --> 04:01.866
But they cleaned it all up.

04:01.901 --> 04:06.407
Well, some of us happen
to like a little pollution.

04:07.228 --> 04:08.478
Look.

04:09.568 --> 04:10.698
My agent just sent a box

04:10.733 --> 04:13.368
of ozawa industrial brothers

04:13.403 --> 04:17.704
Mrs. ladypant beneficial
dryness force.

04:17.738 --> 04:21.640
Mrs. ladypants. I'm thinking
it's not an antiperspirant.

04:21.675 --> 04:24.142
Uh. "Say greeting
to Mrs. ladypant.

04:24.177 --> 04:27.679
For best good times,
be on dry."

04:30.383 --> 04:32.249
That's weird.

04:32.284 --> 04:33.584
There's, like, something in there.

04:33.619 --> 04:36.453
Like a pad or...

04:36.488 --> 04:38.738
A diaper.

04:40.491 --> 04:44.726
What are you talking about?
They're pants.

04:44.761 --> 04:47.861
With an attractive
inner padding.

04:47.896 --> 04:50.363
On their butt.

04:50.398 --> 04:51.598
Oh, give it up, darling.

04:51.633 --> 04:53.566
- It's a diaper.
- It's not a diaper!

04:53.601 --> 04:54.633
It's pants.

04:54.668 --> 04:56.468
And they're comfortable

04:56.503 --> 04:57.769
and perfectly stylish,

04:57.804 --> 04:58.971
and I love them.

04:59.006 --> 05:01.239
And they are paying me
a ton of money to...

05:01.274 --> 05:05.710
"Preserve...
Freshness of crotch."

05:09.005 --> 05:10.814
As pants do.

05:10.849 --> 05:12.349
So just lay off.

05:18.925 --> 05:19.821
Isn't this great?

05:19.856 --> 05:21.656
Look how happy and
relaxed everyone is.

05:21.691 --> 05:22.657
I know.

05:22.692 --> 05:25.059
In L.A., by now, I'd have had
at least one conversation

05:25.094 --> 05:28.028
where someone's looking past me
to find someone more important.

05:28.063 --> 05:29.463
Yeah, I hate that.

05:33.808 --> 05:34.967
And don't you just love

05:35.002 --> 05:37.536
how everyone seems to
have worn whatever?

05:37.571 --> 05:40.505
I mean, look at those women.
Their hair is still wet.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.307
It took me an hour and a
half to blow this dry.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.675
Maybe we should take
a lesson from them.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.444
- Hmm.
- Or maybe they could take

05:46.479 --> 05:48.445
a blow dryer from us.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.780
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello.

05:49.815 --> 05:51.381
I'm Rick from
across the street.

05:51.416 --> 05:54.484
And, yes, I do smell of fish.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.886
We weren't gonna say anything.

05:58.921 --> 06:02.021
I just had a glorious morning
fishing on Lake Erie.

06:02.056 --> 06:04.056
Maybe I could bring you
some muskie some time.

06:04.091 --> 06:05.924
Oh, what a lovely offer.

06:05.959 --> 06:07.829
Ah, there's that fish smell.

06:09.061 --> 06:10.461
So are you a fisherman?

06:10.496 --> 06:13.065
No, no, no, I work for
<i>the plain dealer.</i>

06:13.100 --> 06:14.766
I write a column on Cleveland,

06:14.801 --> 06:16.267
what I like,
what I don't like.

06:16.302 --> 06:18.869
What I would like is to
interview you, Melanie.

06:18.904 --> 06:21.571
It's quite a thing for this neighborhood
to get a best-selling author.

06:21.606 --> 06:24.607
And a famous actress.
Crazy, huh?

06:24.642 --> 06:26.776
I'm not really an author.

06:26.811 --> 06:27.943
One book, you know.

06:27.978 --> 06:30.279
Jotted down 200 things
I wanted to do one day.

06:30.314 --> 06:31.913
But it did sell like crazy.

06:31.948 --> 06:36.617
Although it wasn't on
television for 27 years.

06:36.652 --> 06:38.986
Let her have her moment,
or I'll tell him about your diapers.

06:39.021 --> 06:42.056
- Pants.
- Diapers.

06:42.091 --> 06:44.725
So was moving to Cleveland
one of your list things?

06:44.760 --> 06:48.162
Oh, God, no.
No, before I came here,

06:48.197 --> 06:49.897
I thought, you know,
Cleveland was one of those places

06:49.932 --> 06:51.298
people came from but
they never went to.

06:51.333 --> 06:55.769
Oh. So what made you choose
Cleveland over L.A.?

06:55.804 --> 06:57.905
Oh, gosh, where do I start?

06:57.940 --> 07:01.175
You know, in L.A.,
everyone is so thin and perfect.

07:01.210 --> 07:03.577
It really starts to mess
with your self-esteem.

07:03.612 --> 07:05.379
But here, I feel great.

07:09.284 --> 07:10.617
- I see.
- No. No, wait.

07:10.652 --> 07:13.520
I think I'm not
communicating very well.

07:13.555 --> 07:15.789
You know, Rick,
Melanie isn't as accustomed

07:15.824 --> 07:18.024
to being interviewed as I am.

07:18.059 --> 07:20.325
So maybe you could just
let her have a few moments

07:20.360 --> 07:22.491
to gather her thoughts and
go grab something to eat?

07:22.526 --> 07:25.590
Right, why don't I just go
feed my fat, ugly face.

07:25.625 --> 07:27.291
You forgot smelly.

07:30.360 --> 07:33.261
What is wrong with me?
How did that happen?

07:33.296 --> 07:35.063
I meant to say that
people in L.A.

07:35.098 --> 07:36.464
Are vain and superficial.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.500
- I got to fix this.
- Just let it go.

07:38.535 --> 07:40.602
No, you try to fix that,
you will only make it worse.

07:40.637 --> 07:42.137
T he's our neighbor.

07:42.172 --> 07:43.372
And a columnist.

07:43.407 --> 07:45.005
I don't want him
not to like me.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.105
I like being likeable.

07:47.140 --> 07:49.640
Not to brag,
but it's kind of my thing.

07:49.908 --> 07:52.275
You should be able to tolerate
someone not liking you.

07:52.310 --> 07:53.376
You're right.

07:53.411 --> 07:58.213
I mean, a ton of people don't like you,
and you're fine with it.

07:58.248 --> 08:00.449
I'm gonna staple
my mouth shut.

08:00.484 --> 08:02.684
As soon as I fix this.

08:02.719 --> 08:03.851
- Rick, hi.
- Hi.

08:03.886 --> 08:05.319
I'm just--I'm sorry.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.054
I'd like to explain.

08:07.089 --> 08:09.789
When I said that
people in L.A.

08:09.824 --> 08:11.424
Are perfect and thin,

08:11.459 --> 08:13.960
I did not mean to imply that
everyone here is fat and ugly.

08:13.995 --> 08:15.328
No. Uh-uh.

08:15.363 --> 08:18.631
I just mean, people in L.A.,
they're abnormally thin, right?

08:18.666 --> 08:19.865
Everyone here is normal.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.700
- Ah.
- They're healthy.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.102
Well, I don't know if
I would use healthy.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.438
'Cause, you know, there have
been studies, and it's ver--oh.

08:27.473 --> 08:29.373
What I mean to say is that,

08:29.408 --> 08:31.942
here, you can relax, you know,

08:31.977 --> 08:35.510
- and let yourself go.
- Okay. Okay.

08:35.546 --> 08:39.081
You see it happening, but there's
nothing you can do about it.

08:39.116 --> 08:41.982
So you think we've
let ourselves go.

08:42.018 --> 08:43.049
No. No, no, no.

08:43.085 --> 08:45.085
I meant that, here,

08:45.120 --> 08:46.386
life is simpler.

08:46.421 --> 08:47.888
It's like going back in time.

08:47.923 --> 08:49.556
So we're backward.

08:49.591 --> 08:51.190
No! No!

08:51.225 --> 08:53.425
Why aren't you
understanding this?

08:53.460 --> 08:55.761
Just simple, I guess.

08:55.796 --> 08:59.030
I was wrong. She fixed it.

08:59.065 --> 09:02.599
Hey, how about we all have
some Cuyahoga River punch?

09:06.283 --> 09:08.771
That River hasn't caught
fire in 40 years.

09:08.806 --> 09:10.272
I'm sorry. Let me explain.

09:10.307 --> 09:11.873
Oh, no, that's all right.

09:11.908 --> 09:13.542
I got a column to write.

09:13.577 --> 09:15.743
No, no, I love Cleveland.
I love Lebron.

09:15.778 --> 09:17.111
Or I don't. You tell me!

09:17.146 --> 09:20.446
Frankly, you guys are a little
wishy-washy on that one.

09:22.730 --> 09:26.218
- Oh, it's a fabulous party.
- Oh, really.

09:29.147 --> 09:31.326
- What am I gonna do?
- Oh, stop worrying so much.

09:31.361 --> 09:35.896
Cleveland's a rock and roll town.
Lots of party end with fire.

09:35.931 --> 09:37.231
I can't help but worry,

09:37.266 --> 09:39.866
'cause if Rick is writing the article
I think he's writing about me,

09:39.901 --> 09:41.134
the whole city's
gonna hate me.

09:41.169 --> 09:43.769
Oh, just leave it alone.
It'll blow over.

09:45.256 --> 09:46.472
I know what I have to do.

09:46.507 --> 09:47.940
I have to go across the street

09:47.975 --> 09:49.308
and talk to him.

09:49.343 --> 09:50.909
And he'll see that
I'm a nice person,

09:50.944 --> 09:52.811
because I'm sure he's
a nice person, right?

09:52.846 --> 09:56.014
Right, because your plan has
worked so well up to this point.

09:56.049 --> 09:58.649
Yeah, I know. That's why you're gonna
come over there and back me up.

09:58.684 --> 10:00.351
Well, why do I have to?

10:00.386 --> 10:03.586
You're the one who went all
Don Rickles on Cleveland.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.160
Where's Victoria?
I'm gonna need her too.

10:11.195 --> 10:13.196
Upstairs, trying on her pants.

10:15.618 --> 10:17.748
I don't think we want
to interrupt that.

10:20.706 --> 10:21.872
Do you think he'll
like the wine?

10:21.907 --> 10:22.973
Or does it seem pretentious?

10:23.008 --> 10:24.641
Should I have brought beer?

10:24.676 --> 10:26.042
Mm. Or is that insulting?

10:26.077 --> 10:27.743
Oh, God, is this
from California?

10:27.778 --> 10:29.378
Do they make Cleveland wine?

10:29.413 --> 10:31.980
What did we say about too
many questions in a row?

10:32.015 --> 10:34.216
I know. I'm doing
it again, aren't I?

10:34.251 --> 10:37.552
What's wrong with me?
What is it with me and questions?

10:37.587 --> 10:39.421
He's not home.
We'll try again later.

10:39.456 --> 10:41.022
Wait, wait, no.
I see his computer.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.357
It's got writing on it.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.559
It says, "Melanie MoRetti
is a horrible person."

10:44.594 --> 10:46.294
How can you read
that from here?

10:46.329 --> 10:47.462
I just know.

10:47.497 --> 10:49.264
We have to sneak in
there and read it.

10:49.299 --> 10:51.466
- What?
- Don't you see?

10:51.501 --> 10:53.000
If it's not bad,

10:53.035 --> 10:54.367
then I'll just relax.

10:54.402 --> 10:57.069
But if it's terrible,

10:57.104 --> 11:01.273
someone who really cares
about me could delete it.

11:01.308 --> 11:04.811
Wait. What's that noise?

11:17.824 --> 11:19.957
I can't believe you
left without me.

11:19.992 --> 11:21.825
Are you wearing
your diaper pants?

11:21.860 --> 11:24.227
Stop saying that.

11:24.262 --> 11:28.298
It is the Mrs. ladypant
beneficial dryness force.

11:28.333 --> 11:31.367
I have to wear it at least
once before I can legally say,

11:31.402 --> 11:34.236
"I feel as fresh as mt. Fuji."

11:35.946 --> 11:37.705
So are we breaking into
this place or what?

11:37.740 --> 11:39.640
You don't even know
why we're breaking in.

11:39.675 --> 11:42.208
Well, I'm assuming it's either
to read his column or delete it.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.044
- See?
- All right.

11:44.079 --> 11:47.081
Wait, you go first.
You have padding.

11:49.785 --> 11:51.952
Oh, God, I can't look.

11:51.987 --> 11:53.053
What's it say?

11:53.088 --> 11:54.387
- Oh, my God.
- What?

11:54.422 --> 11:55.388
What? Is it bad?

11:55.423 --> 11:57.056
Oh, it's terrible.

11:57.091 --> 12:00.656
I mean, he doesn't
even mention me.

12:00.691 --> 12:02.089
It's not bad at all.

12:02.124 --> 12:04.517
He just says I'm a
well-meaning klutz.

12:04.552 --> 12:08.348
Well, I guess that trumps
award-nominated actress.

12:08.383 --> 12:10.483
I am so relieved.

12:10.518 --> 12:12.718
- Then what are you doing?
- Changing my age, of course.

12:12.753 --> 12:14.752
- Mm.
- Come on. Let's go.

12:14.787 --> 12:16.555
And don't leave any smudges
on the windowpanes.

12:16.590 --> 12:17.857
I don't want him to know
anybody's been here.

12:17.892 --> 12:21.394
Wait, wait, I think I can
still get away with 41.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.566
I can't believe
we just did that.

12:28.601 --> 12:30.001
My heart is still pounding.

12:30.036 --> 12:31.035
I know. I haven't
felt this excited

12:31.070 --> 12:32.436
about getting away
with something

12:32.471 --> 12:33.804
since I convinced
my fourth husband

12:33.839 --> 12:36.306
that I was still a virgin.

12:36.341 --> 12:38.708
I mean, that was some acting.

12:38.743 --> 12:41.043
Well, I say that we celebrate
now that it's all over.

12:41.078 --> 12:42.344
How about we open
that bottle of wine

12:42.379 --> 12:43.945
you were gonna give to Rick?

12:43.980 --> 12:45.046
No.

12:45.081 --> 12:46.180
Okay. Something else.

12:46.215 --> 12:48.248
No. I mean, it's still there.

12:48.283 --> 12:50.349
I forgot to bring
it out with me,

12:50.384 --> 12:51.516
and it's got a note
on it from me.

12:51.551 --> 12:52.584
He's gonna know I was there.

12:52.619 --> 12:54.352
Oh, great.
Well, we better hurry.

12:54.387 --> 12:58.221
No!

12:58.256 --> 12:59.956
You make too much noise.

12:59.991 --> 13:05.062
Just text me if you see him coming.
I'll be right back. Hey, Elka.

13:05.097 --> 13:06.699
Hi, Elka. Is that your dress?

13:06.734 --> 13:09.468
Don't start with me.

13:09.503 --> 13:10.469
What's wrong?

13:10.504 --> 13:11.770
My hair.

13:11.805 --> 13:14.572
- Oh.
- I got a good look at myself

13:14.607 --> 13:15.773
in the dress shop.

13:15.808 --> 13:18.909
I look like little
orphan granny.

13:18.944 --> 13:20.877
Why didn't you say something?

13:20.912 --> 13:23.313
Well, to be fair,
I did say you looked like Elmo,

13:23.348 --> 13:26.648
and I had a couple of good
bozo jokes at the ready too.

13:27.484 --> 13:30.451
I'm not gonna even go
to that stupid prom.

13:30.486 --> 13:32.986
All the cool seniors
stay home anyway.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.321
Oh.

13:34.356 --> 13:38.224
Get back here, raggedy Ann.

13:38.259 --> 13:39.892
Last one.

13:39.927 --> 13:42.795
You know, I'm not just
an eyebrow expert.

13:42.830 --> 13:46.865
I'm good with all kinds
of unwanted hair.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.466
I can help you.

13:48.501 --> 13:53.070
You're in cahoots with
fat-ass hag-ford, aren't you?

13:53.105 --> 13:55.172
Now you may not
realize this, Elka,

13:55.207 --> 13:58.575
but we are in the
presence of a genius.

13:58.610 --> 14:00.743
Ill-tempered,
disagreeable, snarky, yes.

14:00.778 --> 14:03.946
But I would trust
her with my life,

14:03.981 --> 14:06.348
and more importantly,
with my hair.

14:06.383 --> 14:09.851
I know we can be
hard on each other,

14:09.886 --> 14:11.252
but you have my word.

14:11.287 --> 14:16.990
I will do whatever
I can with that.

14:17.025 --> 14:18.392
And if it doesn't work,

14:18.427 --> 14:20.927
we can park you at
the end of a runway.

14:22.163 --> 14:24.697
All right, there was one more.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.618
Okay.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.436
Let's do it, bones.

14:32.471 --> 14:35.005
I'm sorry. Who?

14:35.040 --> 14:37.741
- Joy.
- Thank you.

14:39.777 --> 14:44.846
Bones. I said bones,
is what I said.

14:56.758 --> 14:59.425
Hello, Melanie.

15:03.939 --> 15:06.539
Oh, my, you have
a beautiful home.

15:06.570 --> 15:08.170
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

15:08.205 --> 15:09.370
Oh, not at all.

15:09.405 --> 15:11.838
I'm just not really
dressed for company.

15:11.873 --> 15:13.609
Oh, what are you talking about?
You're dressed just fine.

15:13.667 --> 15:14.767
Very distinctive.

15:14.802 --> 15:16.335
I love a robe.

15:16.370 --> 15:18.536
Oh. Thank you.

15:18.571 --> 15:21.072
- So...
- Oh, so, Rick,

15:21.107 --> 15:25.443
um, I just wanted
to see you again.

15:25.478 --> 15:27.278
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:27.313 --> 15:29.813
'Cause you know,
there was tension between us

15:29.848 --> 15:31.447
earlier in the day.

15:31.482 --> 15:34.184
You felt it too?

15:34.219 --> 15:35.852
I got to say,
it was pretty obvious.

15:35.887 --> 15:38.121
And then I got all flustered,
and I made it worse.

15:38.156 --> 15:42.892
Well, you're not
flustered now.

15:42.927 --> 15:44.861
Nope. 'Cause we're neighbors.

15:44.896 --> 15:47.129
Maybe even more than neighbors.
We're friends, right?

15:47.164 --> 15:49.664
I hope so.

15:50.234 --> 15:53.134
Wow. Quite a swordfish
you got there.

15:53.169 --> 15:56.429
Oh, thank you.
It's a sailfish actually.

15:56.464 --> 15:58.231
Took me three
hours to land him.

15:58.266 --> 16:00.501
Boy, I loved every second.

16:00.536 --> 16:02.237
You know, there's just
something about the struggle

16:02.272 --> 16:04.572
of man against beast that,
I don't know,

16:04.607 --> 16:06.941
I guess the only word
for it would be primal.

16:06.976 --> 16:07.976
Ohh!

16:10.345 --> 16:13.084
Something catch your interest?

16:13.119 --> 16:16.988
I was admiring your balls.

16:17.023 --> 16:21.424
Really? That's refreshing.

16:21.459 --> 16:23.826
Most women aren't
interested in my balls.

16:23.861 --> 16:28.561
Go ahead. Touch them.

16:33.269 --> 16:35.636
Wow. Smooth.

16:35.671 --> 16:39.273
- They're shellacked.
- Oh, well.

16:39.308 --> 16:40.808
Is that a bottle of wine?

16:40.843 --> 16:44.344
Oh, yes, yes, it's sort
of a peace offering.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.846
Oh. I didn't notice it before.

16:45.881 --> 16:48.115
Well, I was waiting
for the right moment.

16:48.150 --> 16:50.350
And now it's here. Here.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.385
Oh. Look. Why don't
I get some glasses

16:52.420 --> 16:53.586
and you make yourself
comfortable?

16:53.621 --> 16:54.987
That would be lovely.

16:55.022 --> 16:58.456
I'm so glad you came over.

16:58.491 --> 16:59.990
I knew I'd see you again.

17:00.025 --> 17:01.424
I just didn't think it
would be this soon.

17:01.459 --> 17:04.290
Really? I was afraid
you didn't like me.

17:05.387 --> 17:07.826
Oh, I like you.

17:08.570 --> 17:10.598
I like you a lot.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.423
You know what, um,

17:15.458 --> 17:17.492
I don't need the wine.
I'm ready to go now.

17:17.527 --> 17:18.712
As am I.

17:27.983 --> 17:31.139
I don't think it's gonna be a
very nice article after all.

17:31.174 --> 17:33.441
Oh, my God. What happened?

17:33.476 --> 17:35.109
Let's just say there
are worse things

17:35.144 --> 17:37.511
than not having
people like you.

17:37.546 --> 17:38.712
Where's joy?

17:38.747 --> 17:40.833
Helping Elka get
ready for prom.

17:40.874 --> 17:42.333
Really? Joy?

17:46.563 --> 17:47.719
How is she?

17:47.754 --> 17:49.453
Well, it was touch
and go for a minute.

17:49.488 --> 17:51.355
Almost had to use a
local anesthetic,

17:51.390 --> 17:53.190
but she'll make it.

17:55.810 --> 17:58.560
That's Max.
I'm not ready!

18:00.520 --> 18:02.363
Oh, Max,
you look so handsome.

18:02.398 --> 18:04.297
When I wear the suit,

18:04.332 --> 18:05.799
I feel ten years younger.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.634
Which is still 20 years
older than I'd like to be.

18:08.669 --> 18:10.602
Please come in.

18:10.637 --> 18:11.602
- Hey, Max.
- Hello.

18:11.637 --> 18:14.037
- Hi.
- Is everybody ready?

18:14.072 --> 18:15.138
- Yes, yes.
- Yes.

18:16.623 --> 18:19.724
Oh, my gosh.

18:20.448 --> 18:22.479
You are breathtaking.

18:23.293 --> 18:26.181
Which, at my age,
is dangerous.

18:26.890 --> 18:29.551
Max, my eyes are up here.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.352
Just taking it all in.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.523
You are gonna be
prom queen for sure.

18:35.927 --> 18:37.391
Why, thank you.

18:37.426 --> 18:39.059
Not Agnes Bratford?

18:39.552 --> 18:41.428
You mean hagnes fatford?

18:42.930 --> 18:45.397
Max, that's terrible.

18:45.888 --> 18:47.682
Shall we?

18:48.766 --> 18:49.867
Thanks for your help.

18:50.905 --> 18:51.869
It was nothing.

18:51.904 --> 18:53.871
And I hope this marks a
turning point in our--

18:53.906 --> 18:55.906
you fixed my hair.
Let's not go crazy.

18:55.941 --> 18:58.041
She's all yours.

18:58.076 --> 18:59.175
Thank you.

18:59.696 --> 19:01.844
Plan to fix your
own breakfast.

19:07.048 --> 19:08.414
He didn't change his column.

19:08.449 --> 19:10.783
You're still a well-meaning
klutz who's only 41.

19:10.818 --> 19:13.886
Ugh! Should have tried for 39.

19:13.921 --> 19:16.289
Okay, take everything
you used to think

19:16.324 --> 19:18.491
about beneficial
dryness force products

19:18.526 --> 19:19.658
and throw it away.

19:19.693 --> 19:22.393
Okay. Done.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.531
I feel as fresh as mt. Fuji.

19:31.969 --> 19:33.903
Dry for my lifetime

19:33.938 --> 19:35.904
like a monk.

19:35.939 --> 19:37.239
Is it the water?

19:37.274 --> 19:40.675
Or is it the day?

19:40.710 --> 19:42.442
For relaxing times,

19:42.477 --> 19:44.343
make it ladypant time.

19:44.378 --> 19:46.545
Ozawa industrial brothers,

19:46.580 --> 19:48.781
you are the friend
in my pants.

19:57.589 --> 19:59.622
It wasn't my
classiest endeavor.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.558
But just remember,
it's only airing in Japan.

20:02.593 --> 20:04.827
Oh, thank God.

20:04.862 --> 20:06.795
Is that Victoria Chase?

20:06.830 --> 20:08.329
It's probably my Agent,

20:08.364 --> 20:11.465
calling to blow smoke
up my-- well, you know.

20:11.500 --> 20:14.700
Oh, my God.
Is that Victoria Chase?

20:14.735 --> 20:16.369
When do we tell r it's
all over the Internet?

20:16.404 --> 20:19.272
Oh, I know. I saw it too.

20:19.307 --> 20:21.875
I posted it.
