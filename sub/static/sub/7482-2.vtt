WEBVTT

00:06.921 --> 00:10.221
Lear 251
Delta Lima, this is Burbank tower.

00:10.391 --> 00:11.916
Do you read?

00:14.262 --> 00:16.161
Lear 251 Delta Lima,

00:16.331 --> 00:17.423
this is Burbank tower.

00:17.599 --> 00:18.623
Do you read?

00:21.035 --> 00:24.471
Acknowledge, Lear 251 Delta Lima.

00:24.639 --> 00:26.300
They're off course
and under glide slope.

00:26.474 --> 00:29.068
Lear 251 Delta Lima, do you read?

00:29.244 --> 00:31.110
Come right to 020.

00:31.679 --> 00:33.647
Delta Lima, do you read?

00:35.016 --> 00:36.780
- It's seconds out.
- Delta Lima, abort.

00:38.520 --> 00:41.785
Delta Lima, abort!
Delta Lima, abort! Abort!

00:42.357 --> 00:44.052
Run!

01:22.230 --> 01:23.823
How's he doing?

01:25.867 --> 01:27.335
Passed his evals, right?

01:27.502 --> 01:29.732
Oh, with flying colors.

01:30.405 --> 01:31.702
So he's good to go.

01:36.177 --> 01:37.508
Have you talked to Deeks?

01:38.880 --> 01:41.850
He appears
to be screening my calls.

01:42.817 --> 01:44.046
That's brazen.

01:44.485 --> 01:46.214
Indeed.

01:46.387 --> 01:49.823
Oh, my God. Emoticon overload.

01:50.191 --> 01:52.558
These guys from last night
are kind of driving me nuts.

01:52.727 --> 01:54.786
- Which one? Jesse?
- Alex.

01:54.963 --> 01:58.831
What is that?
An ear of corn? A pickle?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.559
That actually looks like a...

02:00.735 --> 02:02.066
Oh, my God, here's Jesse.

02:02.237 --> 02:04.035
"Good morning, beautiful."

02:04.205 --> 02:07.004
"Well, good morning to you,"
smiley face.

02:07.175 --> 02:09.041
You heard from all three?

02:09.210 --> 02:10.268
Haven't you?

02:10.445 --> 02:13.608
- No. My, uh, phone's off.
- Hmm.

02:15.483 --> 02:17.243
Who came up
with this Groupster thing anyway?

02:17.385 --> 02:19.786
Three times the rejection
doesn't seem psychologically sound.

02:19.954 --> 02:21.353
One-on-one is bad enough.

02:21.522 --> 02:23.183
I know, but Rose was so excited,

02:23.358 --> 02:25.725
and, you know, she really needs
to get out and meet guys.

02:25.893 --> 02:28.590
- Yeah, that have a pulse.
- It's supposed to be fun.

02:28.763 --> 02:31.664
Three guys, three girls,
no pressure, no expectations.

02:31.833 --> 02:33.323
I'm sorry. Three's a crowd.

02:34.802 --> 02:37.533
- Is that a heart or a butt?
- You know what? Here's an example.

02:37.705 --> 02:39.469
Three bears, burgled.

02:39.641 --> 02:41.939
Three little piggies,
houses obliterated.

02:42.110 --> 02:44.169
Three blind mice, tails cut off.

02:44.345 --> 02:46.643
I am telling you,
people start killing each other

02:46.814 --> 02:47.894
when the equation is three.

02:48.049 --> 02:50.074
- Wonder if Rose got any calls.
- Yeah.

02:50.251 --> 02:52.310
Only if one of them dropped dead. Ha!

02:53.288 --> 02:54.585
You're bad.

02:56.624 --> 02:57.785
Case on deck.

02:57.959 --> 03:00.155
Ah, here we go.

03:03.131 --> 03:04.257
Haircut?

03:05.500 --> 03:06.661
No, I think it's a new shirt.

03:09.537 --> 03:10.561
Wait a second.

03:11.239 --> 03:14.732
- Are those...?
- Yep, I am wearing pants.

03:14.909 --> 03:15.933
Sad face.

03:17.845 --> 03:20.314
What, you got Old MacDonald's
entire farm in there?

03:20.481 --> 03:22.677
Uh, it's just my mom.

03:24.485 --> 03:26.214
Just her mom.

03:35.430 --> 03:36.795
Well, well, well.

03:36.964 --> 03:38.955
- Look who's wearing big-boy pants.
- Ha, ha.

03:39.133 --> 03:40.828
Uh, Hetty got me these.

03:41.002 --> 03:43.266
I mean, you still have the thongs,
but it's a start.

03:43.438 --> 03:44.803
Might as well be wearing a thong.

03:44.972 --> 03:46.167
Stop whining.

03:46.941 --> 03:48.466
Yes, ma'am.

03:50.345 --> 03:53.315
Early this morning, a private jet,
on its way from Washington, D.C.,

03:53.481 --> 03:54.778
crashed at Burbank Airport.

03:54.949 --> 03:55.973
There's no information

03:56.150 --> 03:58.346
as to why the plane went down,
but at this early hour,

03:58.519 --> 04:00.613
it does appear
no one on board survived.

04:00.788 --> 04:02.449
What did air traffic control say?

04:02.623 --> 04:04.887
The tower lost contact with the jet
upon approach.

04:05.393 --> 04:07.193
The plane appeared
to be on a collision course

04:07.328 --> 04:09.660
before veering off at the last moment,
crashing.

04:09.831 --> 04:12.391
Pilot error?
Could have overshot the runway.

04:12.567 --> 04:14.661
Maybe,
or whoever was flying the plane

04:14.836 --> 04:15.916
had a clear target in mind.

04:16.070 --> 04:17.560
Or maybe they missed a target.

04:17.738 --> 04:19.571
It's who's on board that interests us.

04:19.741 --> 04:22.005
Former Vice Admiral
William Gardner.

04:22.176 --> 04:24.235
He was a key player
in the War on Terror.

04:24.412 --> 04:26.710
Forced into early retirement
ten months ago.

04:26.881 --> 04:30.317
Gardner's uncensored criticism
of the administration lost him his job

04:30.485 --> 04:32.510
and a seat
on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

04:32.687 --> 04:34.416
What was he doing in L.A.?

04:34.589 --> 04:36.853
According to this,
he was brokering a book deal.

04:37.024 --> 04:38.583
“Unbroken Warrior,

04:38.760 --> 04:41.058
a riveting account of the truth
behind the headlines.”

04:41.729 --> 04:43.663
Sam and I will check out the airport.
Kensi...

04:43.831 --> 04:46.596
Uh, you'll be taking Kensi with you,
Mr. Callen.

04:46.768 --> 04:49.100
Oh, great,
my third-wheel status made official.

04:50.037 --> 04:52.699
Not today.
Sam has an appointment.

04:54.308 --> 04:55.332
With who?

04:57.211 --> 04:58.838
That would be me.

05:00.081 --> 05:01.173
Nate.

05:02.583 --> 05:04.210
Good morning.

05:16.430 --> 05:17.920
You want me to see another shrink?

05:18.098 --> 05:21.329
I don't think Mr. Getz
is another shrink.

05:21.501 --> 05:23.333
He knows you, your past.

05:23.503 --> 05:25.096
And he knows I bounce back fast.

05:25.272 --> 05:29.004
Even the most durable fabric
wears out eventually.

05:29.176 --> 05:30.541
Is that what you think, Hetty?

05:30.710 --> 05:31.871
You think I'm worn out?

05:32.045 --> 05:36.414
I worry that you will be
if you don't take care of yourself.

05:36.583 --> 05:39.245
Sit down, Mr. Hanna.

05:39.419 --> 05:41.353
I don't know what more
you want from me, Hetty.

05:41.521 --> 05:43.888
I passed my physical
and my psych assessments.

05:44.858 --> 05:48.226
Have I ever told you
about the time I went blind?

05:49.095 --> 05:50.995
It was in Cambodia.

05:51.164 --> 05:54.156
I was so committed
to my assignment

05:54.334 --> 05:56.325
that I went for weeks existing

05:56.503 --> 05:59.996
on little more than insects
and lemongrass.

06:00.173 --> 06:03.006
So when, at last,
my target presented itself,

06:03.176 --> 06:07.704
I could barely see
to complete my mission.

06:08.448 --> 06:11.179
Vitamin A deficiency.

06:11.718 --> 06:13.015
I take a multivitamin.

06:13.186 --> 06:15.018
- Oh, come.
- Sorry, Hetty.

06:15.188 --> 06:18.283
I get it, but I wouldn't be here
if I didn't think I could do a good job.

06:18.458 --> 06:21.325
Then, your visit with Mr. Getz
will be a mere formality.

06:26.466 --> 06:28.093
How'd you get your sight back?

06:28.568 --> 06:29.592
Carrots.

06:29.769 --> 06:31.999
Always eat your carrots, Mr. Hanna.

06:38.979 --> 06:40.447
Sorry.

06:40.614 --> 06:43.948
I know you were looking forward
to getting back out with Sam.

06:44.150 --> 06:45.777
Yeah,
it's the same for you and Deeks.

06:45.952 --> 06:47.386
Well, let's stay positive.

06:48.021 --> 06:49.045
Good idea.

06:51.157 --> 06:52.522
He won't return my calls.

06:52.692 --> 06:55.354
Don't take it personally. Sam's been
staying close to home as well.

06:55.529 --> 06:57.169
I couldn't get him to go
to a Lakers game.

06:57.297 --> 06:59.493
- Yeah, I bought him a cronut.
- I had courtside se...

06:59.666 --> 07:01.634
- You bought him a what?
- A cronut.

07:01.801 --> 07:04.293
It's a croissant-doughnut hybrid.
Deeks loves them.

07:04.471 --> 07:06.940
I can only get them
in this little bakery in New York City,

07:07.107 --> 07:10.475
and I left it on his doorstep,
and it's still there.

07:11.511 --> 07:12.706
He'll be okay.

07:12.879 --> 07:14.313
Yeah.

07:14.481 --> 07:16.210
They both will.

07:17.551 --> 07:20.987
I'm gonna call Eric,
see if he spoke to the IT guys.

07:25.091 --> 07:28.322
NCIS. Investigating the death
of Vice Admiral Gardner.

07:28.495 --> 07:30.930
Chief Howard,
National Transportation Safety Board.

07:31.097 --> 07:33.395
- How are you?
- Good luck with that.

07:33.567 --> 07:34.728
Come again?

07:34.901 --> 07:37.734
Take a look. Not much left.

07:38.972 --> 07:42.431
So you haven't been able to find
anything that helps explain the crash?

07:42.609 --> 07:45.044
Well, actually,
we've pretty much found everything

07:45.211 --> 07:47.111
except the one thing that could help.

07:47.681 --> 07:48.705
The black box?

07:51.217 --> 07:52.457
The wreck area is pretty small.

07:52.586 --> 07:54.418
But we can't find the box anywhere.

07:54.988 --> 07:56.012
Really?

07:56.189 --> 07:57.452
Really.

07:57.624 --> 07:59.752
You think you can get
onto those ATC computers?

07:59.926 --> 08:02.361
They're not your average
laptops. I'm a geek, not a god.

08:02.529 --> 08:03.553
Eric, okay.

08:03.730 --> 08:06.199
- Let us know what else you find.
- Fine.

08:07.567 --> 08:11.231
IT guys confirmed the tower systems
were operating properly.

08:11.404 --> 08:13.930
Did the pilots give any indication
they were having problems?

08:14.107 --> 08:16.027
No response to any
of the communication attempts.

08:16.176 --> 08:19.476
Total radio silence.
I'm trying to get Eric to verify it,

08:19.646 --> 08:21.580
but something's got his panties
in a twist.

08:21.748 --> 08:24.445
Maybe it's his new pants.

08:33.493 --> 08:36.360
Busy morning.
Is that your, uh, mom again?

08:36.529 --> 08:37.587
A friend.

08:37.764 --> 08:38.804
Friend of you and Kensi's?

08:39.499 --> 08:43.402
Yeah, just someone I hung out with
last night.

08:44.504 --> 08:46.598
With Kensi? On a date?

08:46.773 --> 08:49.003
I don't mean a date with Kensi.
You know what I mean.

08:49.175 --> 08:52.509
Like, Kensi and the guy she's into,
you and the guy you're into.

08:52.679 --> 08:53.737
Not into him,

08:53.913 --> 08:56.507
not into any of them,
and neither is Kensi.

08:56.683 --> 08:58.742
Whoa, whoa, them?

08:59.185 --> 09:01.654
Yeah, okay, there's three of them
and three of us,

09:01.821 --> 09:05.155
but we only went because Rose
really needs to get out more, so...

09:05.325 --> 09:06.486
Oh, Rose came too.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.128
Yeah, it was like a girls' night.

09:09.295 --> 09:10.956
Girls' night with guys.

09:11.498 --> 09:13.830
Who we are not into.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.298
And yet you hung out with them
all evening.

09:16.469 --> 09:19.461
Hey, so should we move
this interrogation into the boatshed?

09:19.639 --> 09:23.269
Oh, sorry, just, uh, curious
how this whole thing works.

09:23.843 --> 09:25.470
Why?

09:25.745 --> 09:27.042
Because you wanna go on one?

09:27.947 --> 09:30.041
What...? Oh, on a date?

09:31.785 --> 09:32.877
What, with you?

09:34.054 --> 09:35.385
No, no.

09:35.555 --> 09:38.650
With, like, other people.

09:38.825 --> 09:40.953
Just, come on, not with me.

09:42.962 --> 09:44.225
No. Heh.

09:44.397 --> 09:46.866
I mean, that's three times
the heartache, right?

09:47.200 --> 09:48.998
For them, I mean.

09:49.936 --> 09:51.461
Right.

09:51.671 --> 09:53.070
Right.

09:55.408 --> 09:57.604
All right, bring on the questions.

09:57.777 --> 09:59.267
Is that what you want?

09:59.446 --> 10:02.643
Me running through a list of questions,
seeing if any of them trigger you?

10:03.083 --> 10:04.278
Trigger me?

10:04.451 --> 10:05.919
I'm a ticking time bomb?

10:06.086 --> 10:07.417
Well, is that how you feel?

10:08.421 --> 10:09.718
I feel fine.

10:09.889 --> 10:12.358
It's just everybody acts
like I'm gonna explode.

10:12.525 --> 10:13.890
In what way?

10:14.060 --> 10:17.519
You know, tiptoeing around,
watching for signs.

10:17.697 --> 10:20.064
Can you blame us?
You went through quite an ordeal.

10:20.233 --> 10:21.667
I've been through a lot worse.

10:21.835 --> 10:24.532
That's not how trauma works, Sam.

10:24.704 --> 10:26.934
Somebody might survive a tsunami,
no problem,

10:27.107 --> 10:30.042
only to be scarred for life
by a trip to the dentist.

10:30.210 --> 10:33.441
Heh. You might not want to use
that example on Deeks.

10:33.613 --> 10:34.842
Noted.

10:35.014 --> 10:37.039
Look, Sam, you and I both know

10:37.217 --> 10:39.276
you're more than well-equipped
to handle this,

10:39.452 --> 10:43.355
and you've got a great
support network here.

10:43.823 --> 10:45.723
The other night,
Michelle and I got into it

10:45.892 --> 10:47.758
over whose turn it was
to do the dishes.

10:48.495 --> 10:49.792
That sounds normal.

10:49.963 --> 10:51.556
She wouldn't let me do them.

10:51.731 --> 10:52.926
That sound normal to you?

10:53.433 --> 10:54.867
It sounds like she cares.

10:55.034 --> 10:57.196
And Callen got us
these amazing tickets

10:57.370 --> 10:58.394
at the Lakers game.

10:59.072 --> 11:00.562
Probably sold a kidney for them.

11:00.740 --> 11:03.437
- Did you go?
- No. It didn't feel right.

11:04.377 --> 11:05.777
Because he's being too nice to you?

11:05.945 --> 11:07.504
Everybody is.

11:07.680 --> 11:11.082
It's like they're trying
to make me feel better when I'm fine.

11:17.290 --> 11:18.917
Remember to relax

11:19.092 --> 11:22.084
and concentrate on the next exercise.

11:22.262 --> 11:23.991
You must breathe very slowly.

11:24.164 --> 11:27.429
Fill what is empty
and empty what is full.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.500
Fill what is empty
and empty what is full.

11:31.504 --> 11:32.767
I am the universe.

11:34.574 --> 11:35.700
I am the universe.

11:35.875 --> 11:38.344
- My head is relaxing.
- My head is relaxing.

11:38.511 --> 11:41.208
- My arms are relaxing.
- My arms are relaxing.

11:41.381 --> 11:44.817
- My abdomen is relaxing.
- My abdomen is relaxing.

11:44.984 --> 11:48.614
- Relax the buttocks.
- Relax the buttocks.

11:49.889 --> 11:50.913
What am I doing?

11:51.090 --> 11:53.787
Clench, release. Clench, release.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.519
Clench, release.

11:55.695 --> 11:58.357
- Clench, release.
- I am one with the universe.

11:58.531 --> 12:00.625
I am one with the universe.

12:04.003 --> 12:06.097
God, Hetty, what are you doing?

12:06.272 --> 12:08.639
Well, I thought
I'd brave the monsoon

12:09.142 --> 12:10.610
to come check on you.

12:14.914 --> 12:18.612
Storm sounds. Supposed to make it
easier to fall asleep, so...

12:19.285 --> 12:22.482
- You having trouble sleeping?
- Heh.

12:22.789 --> 12:25.724
Yeah, I'd say
I have a little case of insomnia.

12:26.659 --> 12:30.323
Probably all that clenching
and releasing.

12:35.335 --> 12:37.531
- You've been busy.
- Well, when you don't sleep,

12:37.704 --> 12:40.639
you realize how many hours there are
in the day you have to fill.

12:40.807 --> 12:42.832
Well, if you're bored,

12:43.810 --> 12:46.472
perhaps you could come back
to work.

12:46.646 --> 12:49.206
I didn't even know that you, um...
I didn't know you were coming.

12:49.315 --> 12:50.995
If I knew...
You want something? Some milk?

12:51.084 --> 12:53.917
Oh, no, no, no. I can't stay long.
I just came to,

12:55.788 --> 12:58.621
uh, see if your phone was working.

13:00.360 --> 13:05.059
Forty-three missed calls.

13:05.265 --> 13:06.858
Fancy that.

13:07.367 --> 13:09.028
Like you said, I've been busy.

13:09.769 --> 13:11.362
So has Kensi.

13:11.537 --> 13:13.437
For the past few weeks.

13:13.606 --> 13:15.768
Without a partner.

13:17.143 --> 13:19.373
I'm gonna need a decision soon.

13:20.046 --> 13:23.983
Especially if I need
to find a replacement.

13:24.918 --> 13:26.682
Of course.

13:30.256 --> 13:32.418
I'll leave you to your storm.

13:33.226 --> 13:37.561
Hopefully it'll pass
without too much damage.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.949
Feel your troubles melting away

13:57.116 --> 14:01.417
as you drift off to
a world of serenity.

14:32.518 --> 14:34.816
Oh, you can't.

14:34.987 --> 14:38.423
Not from a Beale man.
Now this is on me. I'll show you, Hetty.

14:39.258 --> 14:40.657
Hello.

14:40.826 --> 14:42.760
- Uh, you ever hear of knocking?
- Sorry.

14:42.928 --> 14:44.657
Last I checked,
this was the burn room,

14:44.830 --> 14:45.888
not the locker room.

14:47.499 --> 14:50.525
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like I'm doing?

14:50.702 --> 14:53.296
Something really weird?

14:53.806 --> 14:55.001
Are those your pants?

14:56.375 --> 15:01.472
- Um, no.
- Oh, my God.

15:04.283 --> 15:05.307
Those are not my pants.

15:05.484 --> 15:07.248
I do not own pants.
Those are Hetty's pants.

15:07.419 --> 15:10.252
Interesting, and you were going
to incinerate them?

15:10.422 --> 15:12.948
- Do you have a death wish?
- I didn't have a choice.

15:13.125 --> 15:15.116
- Did you have an accident?
- Ew, no.

15:15.294 --> 15:16.614
Those things are driving me nuts.

15:16.762 --> 15:19.993
They're so constrictive. It's like my legs
are trapped in a straitjacket.

15:20.165 --> 15:21.223
Eric, they're pants.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.994
People have been wearing them
for thousands of years.

15:24.169 --> 15:25.261
Oh, no, no, not my people.

15:25.437 --> 15:27.428
The Beales of the Clan McBeale.

15:27.606 --> 15:28.630
And now you're Scottish?

15:28.807 --> 15:30.138
As heather and haggis.

15:30.309 --> 15:32.641
- So why don't you wear a kilt?
- I do. I did. I used to.

15:32.811 --> 15:34.540
Until this little incident with Hetty.

15:34.713 --> 15:36.647
It's easy to forget how short she is.

15:36.815 --> 15:40.308
- Her eyeline is lower than you think.
- Yup, got it. Thanks.

15:40.485 --> 15:43.147
Okay, I suggest you take
your bag-o-pants

15:43.322 --> 15:45.402
and put them back on your body
before Hetty finds out

15:45.557 --> 15:48.185
or else it'll be your butt
in the incinerator.

15:49.294 --> 15:51.490
And there was a last-minute
passenger

15:51.663 --> 15:53.631
added to the flight's manifest.

15:53.799 --> 15:56.530
Jason Carter?
How do I know that name?

15:57.402 --> 15:59.131
Jason Carter was a journalist.

15:59.304 --> 16:01.295
He had written a number
of high profile pieces

16:01.473 --> 16:03.635
on a variety of different topics.

16:03.809 --> 16:05.573
He was even nominated
for a Pulitzer

16:05.744 --> 16:08.543
for an article he wrote on hydraulic
fracturing and the oil companies.

16:09.014 --> 16:10.072
That's how I know him.

16:10.249 --> 16:11.648
For the past year or so,

16:11.817 --> 16:13.808
he had been writing
about the war in Afghanistan,

16:13.986 --> 16:17.081
embedding himself
in several different units.

16:17.256 --> 16:20.055
Maybe he was interviewing
the vice admiral on the flight.

16:20.225 --> 16:21.522
Reasonable assumption.

16:21.693 --> 16:23.889
So I contacted his publisher.

16:24.062 --> 16:27.862
Turns out, he was the ghost writer
for the admiral's memoir.

16:28.033 --> 16:31.162
Somebody didn't want this book
being published.

16:32.537 --> 16:35.097
Listen. I wouldn't jeopardize
Callen and the rest of the team

16:35.274 --> 16:36.901
if I didn't think I could hold my own.

16:37.075 --> 16:41.137
Look, I appreciate that, Sam,
and I believe you.

16:41.313 --> 16:43.353
I know you put your partner
and the rest of the team

16:43.482 --> 16:44.506
above your own safety.

16:44.683 --> 16:48.119
Okay, then you know pretty much
all there is to know.

16:48.954 --> 16:50.388
Hetty doesn't think so.

16:50.555 --> 16:52.580
Then maybe you should go
talk to Hetty.

16:52.858 --> 16:55.088
You know, you're probably right.

16:58.497 --> 16:59.521
Is that it?

16:59.998 --> 17:02.763
I'm only here
because Hetty worries about you.

17:05.137 --> 17:06.627
Nate. Ahem.

17:08.973 --> 17:11.602
The only way to survive is to let go.

17:12.877 --> 17:14.157
I keep a little something behind

17:14.313 --> 17:17.578
in case there's a chance
to escape or attack, but...

17:18.416 --> 17:19.942
The rest of me is gone.

17:21.286 --> 17:23.584
I see them wailing on that guy
in the chair...

17:25.924 --> 17:28.051
I can't help him.

17:28.994 --> 17:31.053
When it's over, I reconnect.

17:31.229 --> 17:33.823
And the only thing left
are some scars.

17:38.603 --> 17:41.504
I'm afraid one day I may drift off

17:41.673 --> 17:43.437
and never reconnect.

17:47.713 --> 17:50.273
Then what happens to the guy
in the chair?

17:57.656 --> 17:59.590
- Yeah?
- Special Agent Callen.

17:59.758 --> 18:02.989
Special Agent Blye, NCIS. We were
wondering if we could take a look

18:03.161 --> 18:05.255
inside of Jason Carter's apartment.

18:05.430 --> 18:07.330
Yeah, I guess.

18:07.499 --> 18:08.523
I heard he died.

18:08.700 --> 18:11.499
Shame. Nice guy, good tenant.

18:11.970 --> 18:13.665
This have anything to do
with the fire?

18:13.839 --> 18:16.308
- I'm sorry, the fire?
- In his apartment.

18:16.475 --> 18:19.308
The place was gutted
day before yesterday.

18:20.112 --> 18:24.208
Fire marshal said it could take a week
or more to determine what happened.

18:24.383 --> 18:26.223
Had an insurance company out here
this morning.

18:26.385 --> 18:28.717
They wanted to take a look too.
Not much left.

18:29.254 --> 18:32.121
Fortunately,
nobody was home at the time.

18:32.824 --> 18:35.885
This guy's had a bit of a run
of bad luck, huh?

18:36.061 --> 18:38.462
This is Jason's girlfriend.

18:38.630 --> 18:41.156
Julie, these are the agents
from, um...

18:41.333 --> 18:42.357
NCIS.

18:42.534 --> 18:44.662
- His insurance company?
- No.

18:44.836 --> 18:47.032
Naval Criminal Investigative Service.

18:52.677 --> 18:54.406
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

19:02.821 --> 19:05.313
- Need a hand?
- Oh.

19:06.425 --> 19:08.154
Thank you.

19:11.830 --> 19:13.924
I didn't even know
Jason was on his way home

19:14.099 --> 19:16.830
until I saw the message
on my phone.

19:18.103 --> 19:19.400
What did the message say?

19:20.238 --> 19:24.232
Just that he was able to get a ride
back to L.A.

19:24.409 --> 19:26.207
with the vice admiral,

19:26.378 --> 19:28.346
and was gonna use the time
to interview him.

19:31.950 --> 19:36.615
I fell asleep waiting up for him.
I kept expecting him to crawl into bed

19:36.788 --> 19:38.950
and kiss me good night.

19:39.424 --> 19:42.416
When I woke up in the morning
and he wasn't there,

19:43.462 --> 19:45.760
I knew something was wrong.

19:45.931 --> 19:48.457
And he wasn't answering his phone,
so I came here,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.594
and the fire department
was just leaving.

19:51.770 --> 19:55.001
I was standing here,
already in shock

19:55.173 --> 20:01.442
when the police called to tell me Jason
was killed in the plane crash.

20:01.613 --> 20:03.733
So when was the last time
you actually spoke with him?

20:05.450 --> 20:06.940
Uh, four days ago.

20:07.119 --> 20:09.645
He give you any indication
that something might've been wrong?

20:09.821 --> 20:12.222
He seemed a little stressed maybe?

20:12.724 --> 20:13.748
Callen?

20:15.293 --> 20:16.852
Excuse me.

20:18.296 --> 20:20.958
So super wasn't kidding
when he said the place was gutted.

20:21.133 --> 20:24.535
Forensics will be able to tell us more,
but the fire was hot and fast.

20:24.703 --> 20:26.228
Pro job.

20:30.175 --> 20:31.665
Julie?

20:32.811 --> 20:35.576
Do you know anybody
that would've wanted to hurt Jason?

20:35.747 --> 20:37.306
No.

20:37.983 --> 20:39.678
Some of his articles
earned him hate mail.

20:39.851 --> 20:41.785
Did he tell you
what he was currently working on?

20:41.953 --> 20:44.149
No, he didn't talk much about work.

20:44.322 --> 20:46.256
Did he ever give you anything
to keep for him?

20:46.424 --> 20:47.585
No.

20:47.759 --> 20:49.693
Why, do you think
something he was working on

20:49.861 --> 20:50.941
played a part in his death?

20:51.096 --> 20:53.463
We're considering
a lot of possibilities.

21:00.739 --> 21:03.219
Please tell me your presence here
is because of your excitement

21:03.375 --> 21:05.742
over a startling and revealing piece
of valuable evidence

21:05.911 --> 21:07.231
- that solves this case.
- Well...

21:07.345 --> 21:09.677
You know what,
I'll settle for a run-of-the-mill clue.

21:09.848 --> 21:11.282
Actually, I have more bad news.

21:12.017 --> 21:14.384
Is it worse than Jason Carter's
apartment being torched?

21:14.553 --> 21:16.487
- Virtually.
- What is it?

21:16.655 --> 21:17.816
- Virtually.
- What?

21:17.989 --> 21:19.821
- Virtually.
- I think he's stuck.

21:19.991 --> 21:21.720
I knew Hetty was a robot,
but now him?

21:21.893 --> 21:24.157
No... Virtually as in cyberspace.

21:24.329 --> 21:27.026
As in somebody's been
scrubbing through his electronic life.

21:27.199 --> 21:29.190
As in they hijacked his cloud
and wiped it clean

21:29.367 --> 21:30.391
an hour after he died.

21:30.569 --> 21:32.037
This is some serious voodoo.

21:32.204 --> 21:33.865
I'm talking black-bag kung fu,

21:34.039 --> 21:36.667
ninja warrior assassin level hacking.

21:37.042 --> 21:39.272
Do you have any idea
what he's saying?

21:39.444 --> 21:41.105
I really don't, but I think it's bad.

21:41.279 --> 21:43.748
Either that
or his motherboard was fried.

21:43.915 --> 21:47.715
So who do we know
with this level of cyber warcraft?

21:47.886 --> 21:49.320
I may have a guy.

21:50.822 --> 21:53.154
This is the security cam footage
from the airport.

21:53.592 --> 21:56.254
And I think this is the black box.

21:56.428 --> 21:57.452
Orange.

21:57.629 --> 22:00.189
See, that's why we didn't find it,
because somebody stole it.

22:00.365 --> 22:03.198
Why would someone steal
a plane's flight recorder?

22:03.368 --> 22:04.392
Million-dollar question.

22:04.569 --> 22:05.809
No, the million-dollar question

22:05.937 --> 22:08.304
is why is it called the black box
if it's always orange?

22:08.473 --> 22:10.833
If somebody wanted to find out
what happened to the aircraft

22:10.976 --> 22:12.034
in its last few moments.

22:12.210 --> 22:13.769
Or if they didn't want someone
to know.

22:15.313 --> 22:16.953
Then they would get away
in the confusion.

22:17.082 --> 22:19.847
Yup. And I believe the same vehicle
entered the airport

22:20.018 --> 22:22.214
just 24 hours earlier. See?

22:22.387 --> 22:25.652
- Plain, inconspicuous.
- They probably parked it in a hangar

22:25.824 --> 22:27.724
and then reskinned it
as an emergency vehicle.

22:27.892 --> 22:30.384
And then all they had to do
was wait for the crash to happen.

22:30.562 --> 22:33.054
So they show up on the scene
as emergency workers,

22:33.231 --> 22:36.360
and when everyone else is busy,
they walk off with the flight recorder.

22:36.534 --> 22:38.534
Also means they knew
the crash was going to happen.

22:38.703 --> 22:40.432
Which proves it was sabotage.

22:40.605 --> 22:42.300
I'm running hangar rental
and owner lists,

22:42.474 --> 22:44.374
but still no luck
facial rec-ing these guys.

22:44.542 --> 22:47.102
- Okay, what about the vehicle?
- Working on that too.

22:47.279 --> 22:48.439
I doubt you're gonna find it.

22:48.580 --> 22:51.515
These guys haven't left much
to chance.

23:01.725 --> 23:03.819
Someone deliberately crashes
their plane

23:03.994 --> 23:06.053
in what was described
as an aborted kamikaze flight

23:06.230 --> 23:08.390
- into the tower.
- Could have been a struggle onboard.

23:08.532 --> 23:10.967
Hijacking and struggle
would be the most logical explanation.

23:11.134 --> 23:12.795
But all of these guys are top-drawer.

23:12.970 --> 23:15.337
None of them have anything
in their profile or background

23:15.506 --> 23:18.498
that would even remotely suggest
that they could be responsible for this.

23:18.675 --> 23:22.339
Which is where our black-box-stealing
mystery emergency workers come in.

23:22.513 --> 23:24.777
- Could they be responsible?
- It's not likely.

23:24.948 --> 23:26.746
The plane originated in Washington.

23:26.917 --> 23:30.012
Would've had to have sabotaged it
days before to have been waiting here.

23:30.187 --> 23:32.019
Which would suggest accomplices.

23:32.189 --> 23:34.470
This is starting to sound
like a conspiracy nut's fantasy.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.320
Only this might be real.

23:36.493 --> 23:38.484
- Okay, good luck.
- Thank you.

23:39.463 --> 23:41.295
How was the zoo?

23:41.465 --> 23:42.694
Did you get a churro?

23:43.767 --> 23:45.792
- That's funny. It's a good one.
- Hey.

23:46.370 --> 23:47.394
Sure you want him back?

23:47.571 --> 23:50.097
Can I have the rest of the week
to think about it?

23:53.710 --> 23:54.734
Satellite on yet?

23:55.479 --> 23:56.742
Not yet.

23:56.914 --> 23:58.882
So just give me the greatest hits.

24:00.784 --> 24:02.878
He's as stubborn as he is big.

24:03.654 --> 24:06.851
I consider both of those to be assets
in an agent.

24:07.357 --> 24:09.018
And they don't make them
any tougher.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.688
That's also why he's here.

24:12.129 --> 24:14.826
But the trauma and damage
he experienced,

24:14.998 --> 24:16.523
it's cumulative.

24:16.700 --> 24:22.002
Physically and psychologically,
as you well know.

24:22.639 --> 24:25.239
If it happens too many more times,
he could reach a breaking point

24:25.375 --> 24:27.434
where he can't take it anymore.

24:27.945 --> 24:29.606
You also know
what can happen then.

24:33.951 --> 24:35.715
Thank you, Nate.

24:35.886 --> 24:39.379
Now could you turn your attentions
to Detective Deeks?

24:40.791 --> 24:42.088
Anything I should know?

24:43.226 --> 24:46.787
I don't want him back
if he's not the man he was.

24:50.734 --> 24:53.066
- So, what'd Nate have to say?
- Ah.

24:53.370 --> 24:56.101
- Same old shrink mumbo jumbo.
- Yeah.

24:56.273 --> 24:58.113
"You ever have sexual fantasies
about your mom?

24:58.275 --> 24:59.955
Ever wear her clothes
when she's not home?"

25:00.110 --> 25:02.044
- That sort of thing?
- What?

25:02.212 --> 25:03.652
What the hell are you talking about?

25:04.448 --> 25:05.968
He asked you
that kind of stuff before?

25:06.116 --> 25:07.515
Yeah, but...

25:07.684 --> 25:10.483
I mean, that's normal shrink stuff.

25:10.654 --> 25:13.055
- Are you messing with me?
- I'm not messing with you.

25:13.857 --> 25:17.851
Ha, ha. Don't be messing with me
on my first day back, man.

25:19.730 --> 25:21.892
Anyone hear an explosion
prior to the plane crash?

25:22.065 --> 25:23.624
No.

25:24.067 --> 25:27.264
And no sign of any explosive devices
from what I can see.

25:27.437 --> 25:29.477
This all happened from this plane
hitting the ground

25:29.606 --> 25:31.836
at several hundred miles per hour.

25:32.009 --> 25:33.807
With a crew with a flawless record.

25:33.977 --> 25:35.809
In a plane that was just as safe.

25:42.753 --> 25:44.152
What do you got?

25:44.321 --> 25:47.347
Looks like it was a digital recorder
in its former life.

25:56.967 --> 25:58.435
Well?

25:58.635 --> 26:01.696
I'm not sure. I mean, it's digital,
so it should be there.

26:01.872 --> 26:03.840
It's just a matter of the damage.

26:04.641 --> 26:05.938
What else?

26:06.109 --> 26:07.975
Afghanistan... never...

26:08.145 --> 26:09.806
conquered by a foreign army.

26:09.980 --> 26:12.039
The Russians
learned... the hard way...

26:12.215 --> 26:13.910
Absolutely not...

26:14.084 --> 26:16.109
The war with Afghanistan...

26:16.286 --> 26:18.687
the country trying to weed out
persistent terrorists.

26:18.855 --> 26:20.983
Bastards... to Pakistan.

26:21.158 --> 26:22.751
What would it take to put...?

26:22.926 --> 26:24.018
Money.

26:24.194 --> 26:25.719
Money and more troops.

26:26.496 --> 26:28.225
Private contractors. Billions.

26:28.398 --> 26:30.758
Whoa, what was that when he said
money, private contractors?

26:30.901 --> 26:31.993
Can you dig it out more?

26:32.169 --> 26:33.193
I can try.

26:33.370 --> 26:34.997
Same... set of... military.

26:35.172 --> 26:37.072
Our people... properly trained.

26:37.240 --> 26:38.264
Theirs are not.

26:38.442 --> 26:40.740
They're a... risk that...

26:40.911 --> 26:43.744
- Lots... cover-ups.
- Sounded like he said cover-ups.

26:45.482 --> 26:46.643
Risk the...

26:46.817 --> 26:48.342
Lots... cover-ups.

26:48.518 --> 26:51.544
Hell... be proof of what... considered
war crimes.

26:53.490 --> 26:55.015
That's it.

26:55.192 --> 26:56.832
He was talking
about war crimes committed.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.400
Without the entire recording,
we can only guess what was said,

26:59.529 --> 27:00.809
but that's what it sounded like.

27:00.964 --> 27:03.592
Well, if you had proof
that Americans with war contracts

27:03.767 --> 27:05.257
committed atrocities overseas

27:05.435 --> 27:07.494
while employed
by the U.S. government,

27:07.671 --> 27:10.606
I'd say there are those
who would kill to keep that buried.

27:11.074 --> 27:12.906
You need to hear this.

27:19.716 --> 27:22.242
Let me guess, you're stuck in traffic.

27:22.419 --> 27:24.615
No. Uh, hi, Hetty.

27:24.788 --> 27:27.314
No, I thought
you were gonna be Deeks.

27:27.891 --> 27:29.882
No, he hasn't showed yet.

27:30.060 --> 27:33.826
In fact, he's not answering
his phone calls or e-mails.

27:34.364 --> 27:36.264
An amateur plane spotter
and his buddy sent this

27:36.433 --> 27:38.959
to the Burbank Police Department.
Now, they were parked here,

27:39.136 --> 27:40.194
listening in on the tower,

27:40.370 --> 27:43.772
when they picked up on this
from a different radio frequency.

27:43.940 --> 27:45.533
Lear 251 Delta Lima,

27:45.709 --> 27:47.143
this is Burbank tower. Do you read?

27:47.878 --> 27:49.312
Tower said they never responded.

27:49.479 --> 27:52.278
They thought they were responding
to the tower. They actually weren't.

27:52.449 --> 27:55.316
Burbank tower.
Lear 251 Delta Lima.

27:55.485 --> 27:57.525
We have you loud and clear.
Little foggy down there.

27:57.654 --> 27:59.884
That's the pilot
of Admiral Gardner's plane.

28:00.056 --> 28:02.491
Delta Lima,
we're still above minimums here,

28:02.659 --> 28:04.058
unbroken with a 300-foot ceiling.

28:04.227 --> 28:06.457
If that's not the tower,
then who the hell is it?

28:06.630 --> 28:09.497
I don't know. I ran it through voice
recognition, nothing came back.

28:09.666 --> 28:11.998
Burbank tower,
I may have some instrument issues.

28:12.169 --> 28:14.331
Altimeter isn't matching
my other displays.

28:14.504 --> 28:19.442
Computer's got me at a thousand feet
and altimeter is reading 750.

28:19.609 --> 28:22.271
Altimeter setting is 2886.

28:22.445 --> 28:24.311
We have you descending
through 900 feet.

28:24.481 --> 28:26.745
Glide slope is spot-on.

28:26.917 --> 28:28.942
Come left to 024 degrees.

28:29.119 --> 28:30.917
You're cleared to land.

28:31.087 --> 28:33.385
Wilco, 024 and cleared to land.

28:33.557 --> 28:36.026
Look out. Look out! Pull up! Pull up!

28:36.193 --> 28:37.922
We're going down!

28:39.596 --> 28:41.189
Three seconds later, they crashed.

28:41.898 --> 28:43.696
Somebody intercepted
the tower's radio system

28:43.867 --> 28:45.028
as well as that of the plane.

28:45.202 --> 28:47.933
And were able to sabotage
the jet's instrument system.

28:48.104 --> 28:52.132
Like I said, serious voodoo.

29:02.551 --> 29:04.883
So an outspoken Navy admiral
is speaking with a journalist

29:05.054 --> 29:06.647
known for controversial stories.

29:06.822 --> 29:09.655
And they wanna keep him quiet
so they kill the admiral and the writer.

29:09.825 --> 29:11.486
Making it look like a plane crash.

29:11.661 --> 29:13.789
Wiping out evidence
of what the journalist was doing.

29:13.963 --> 29:16.364
And we have nothing
but a few seconds of interview.

29:17.133 --> 29:21.297
What if the journalist gave his girlfriend
copies of his work for safekeeping?

29:21.904 --> 29:23.030
But he didn't.

29:23.673 --> 29:25.471
Maybe those responsible
don't know that.

29:29.311 --> 29:31.939
More evidence is surfacing
about the fiery plane crash

29:32.114 --> 29:35.448
in Burbank yesterday that killed
retired Navy Vice Admiral Gardner.

29:35.618 --> 29:37.347
Another victim has been identified

29:37.520 --> 29:39.852
as controversial journalist
Jason Carter.

29:40.022 --> 29:42.062
According to sources close to Carter,
he was worried

29:42.224 --> 29:43.692
about his own safety recently

29:43.859 --> 29:45.384
because of the story
he was working on,

29:45.561 --> 29:47.859
excerpts of which have been released
by his girlfriend.

29:48.297 --> 29:50.994
The following conversation
between Carter and the vice admiral

29:51.167 --> 29:55.365
is believed to have been recorded
Just moments before the fatal crash.

29:55.538 --> 29:58.200
Our people are
properly trained. Theirs are not.

29:58.374 --> 30:01.674
They're a security risk that resulted
in lots of cover-ups.

30:01.844 --> 30:02.924
Hell, we've even seen proof

30:03.079 --> 30:05.207
of what would be considered
war crimes.

30:05.381 --> 30:07.941
The investigation into the crash
that killed Vice Admiral Gardner

30:08.084 --> 30:09.449
and Jason Carter is ongoing,

30:09.618 --> 30:11.086
and this latest development
suggests

30:11.253 --> 30:14.052
this story is far from over.

30:14.957 --> 30:17.289
Will this be enough
to draw them out?

30:17.860 --> 30:22.388
Whoever's responsible
went to extremes to bury this.

30:22.998 --> 30:27.060
I doubt they have any intentions
of stopping now.

30:29.105 --> 30:31.267
Our people are properly trained.

30:31.440 --> 30:32.669
Theirs are not.

30:32.842 --> 30:35.903
They're a security risk
that resulted in lots of cover-ups.

30:36.078 --> 30:39.309
Hell, we've even seen proof of what
would be considered war crimes.

30:39.482 --> 30:40.881
What else do you wanna know?

30:41.484 --> 30:44.749
Afghanistan has never been
conquered by a foreign army.

30:45.254 --> 30:47.348
The Russians learned that
the hard way.

30:47.523 --> 30:49.787
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

30:58.434 --> 31:00.061
Showtime.

31:13.115 --> 31:14.640
You put a surveillance camera

31:14.817 --> 31:17.218
inside a garden gnome?

31:17.386 --> 31:18.979
Yeah, we call it the Hetty-cam.

31:22.224 --> 31:24.886
Hey, now, these guys are real pros.

31:25.060 --> 31:26.140
Wouldn't you say so, Hetty?

31:26.295 --> 31:28.923
I could say many things.

31:29.098 --> 31:30.327
Many, many.

31:31.133 --> 31:33.329
Look, they're picking the lock.

31:39.575 --> 31:41.600
Absolutely not the same situation.

31:41.777 --> 31:44.610
We're not at war with Afghanistan.

31:44.780 --> 31:47.220
We're in the country trying
to weed out persistent terrorists.

31:47.349 --> 31:49.443
Bastards keep migrating
to Pakistan.

31:49.618 --> 31:51.211
Isn't that just semantics?

31:51.387 --> 31:53.378
What would it really take
to put an end to this?

31:53.556 --> 31:55.991
Money. It'd take
more money and more troops,

31:57.593 --> 31:59.823
but we're inundated
with private contractors

31:59.995 --> 32:01.053
who waste billions.

32:01.230 --> 32:03.699
They call Washington corrupt.
These bastards take the cake.

32:04.166 --> 32:06.692
So now you're talking
about multinational corporations.

32:13.242 --> 32:14.505
I've had my flu shot.

32:14.677 --> 32:16.304
What the...?

32:27.723 --> 32:30.886
- Kitty Corner?
- I only read it for the articles.

32:31.060 --> 32:32.824
Federal agent.
Don't even think about it.

32:33.762 --> 32:34.820
What'd I just say?

32:35.531 --> 32:37.363
You're still thinking about it.

32:37.867 --> 32:40.234
"What if I distract him
with the magazine, dive for cover,

32:40.402 --> 32:41.767
draw and fire?"

32:41.937 --> 32:43.336
That might work,

32:43.839 --> 32:45.199
but they'd fill you full of holes.

32:52.548 --> 32:54.016
Good call.

33:10.065 --> 33:11.396
Wish you were out there?

33:13.135 --> 33:15.229
No such thing
as a bad day in the water.

33:17.239 --> 33:18.729
I came.

33:19.275 --> 33:21.573
Even had my hand on the door.

33:21.777 --> 33:24.075
I don't know what happened.
I just couldn't come in.

33:24.246 --> 33:26.112
Pretty sure you'd feel better
if we talked.

33:26.282 --> 33:28.182
Pretty sure I wouldn't.

33:28.984 --> 33:33.046
Look, even though I'm here
at Hetty's request...

33:33.222 --> 33:34.462
Well, I've got my own opinions.

33:35.991 --> 33:40.258
Only one who matters in all this is you.
I have no agenda beyond making sure

33:40.429 --> 33:42.229
you're in the best place you can be
right now.

33:42.364 --> 33:46.130
And how can you possibly know what
that place is when I don't even know?

33:47.336 --> 33:49.168
Perspective?

33:49.905 --> 33:51.873
Seldom do we know
what we need for ourselves.

33:52.541 --> 33:55.238
What I need is sleep.

33:55.411 --> 33:56.742
Why do you think you can't sleep?

33:56.912 --> 33:59.882
Because every time I close my eyes,
my mind just keeps running.

34:00.049 --> 34:01.642
With what?

34:02.217 --> 34:03.912
All sorts of stuff, man.

34:05.220 --> 34:06.984
- The abduction?
- Yes, the abduction.

34:07.790 --> 34:08.813
Torture?

34:08.991 --> 34:13.929
The abduction, torture,
when I was shot.

34:14.396 --> 34:17.127
Falling off my bike when I was
8 years old, stepping on a bee,

34:17.299 --> 34:19.630
nursery rhymes, grocery lists,
infomercials.

34:19.802 --> 34:22.862
It's like someone took all my memories
and just put them into a blender.

34:23.038 --> 34:24.598
You went through
a traumatic experience.

34:24.739 --> 34:26.208
But this is not my first experience.

34:26.375 --> 34:28.935
No, but maybe something
about this one had more impact.

34:29.378 --> 34:31.618
Your brain could be trying
to make sense of what happened

34:31.780 --> 34:35.181
by comparing it to past experiences,
but you got nothing that comes close,

34:35.351 --> 34:38.184
so it's working a little harder
to resolve it.

34:38.353 --> 34:40.947
Okay, so how long
is this supposed to last?

34:41.389 --> 34:43.757
I don't think I have a definitive answer
for that,

34:43.926 --> 34:46.759
but the more you talk about it
out here,

34:46.929 --> 34:48.849
the less you're gonna
have to work on it in here.

34:48.998 --> 34:50.757
So, what, in the meantime,
I just walk around

34:50.899 --> 34:53.739
- with the mind of a schizophrenic?
- I don't think you have to worry...

34:53.869 --> 34:56.496
You know, it's funny
because I already get the Shaggy jokes

34:56.672 --> 34:58.299
and how I'm halfway to homeless.

34:58.474 --> 35:01.341
You know, what's crazy
is that I see these guys,

35:01.510 --> 35:04.271
I hear them talking to themselves,
and it's scaring the hell out of me

35:04.413 --> 35:06.453
because if I were to say
what's going on in my mind,

35:06.582 --> 35:07.947
it wouldn't be that different.

35:08.484 --> 35:10.748
Well, that's the real difference.

35:10.919 --> 35:12.853
You're worried about it.

35:13.088 --> 35:15.318
I'd be more concerned
if you weren't.

35:15.891 --> 35:17.222
So I'm not crazy?

35:17.393 --> 35:19.953
Not yet.
If you don't start getting some sleep,

35:20.129 --> 35:21.858
you're gonna start to act
and feel like it.

35:24.266 --> 35:26.894
- What about Kensi?
- What about her?

35:27.069 --> 35:29.697
You two obviously
have something special.

35:31.106 --> 35:32.835
Who told you that?

35:33.275 --> 35:34.640
You're partners.

35:34.810 --> 35:36.369
That's a special relationship.

35:36.545 --> 35:38.707
Look at Callen and Sam.

35:40.249 --> 35:41.478
Right, of course.

35:41.650 --> 35:44.347
What is it about your partnership
that's unique?

35:44.920 --> 35:46.680
What do you mean?
What do you mean, "unique"?

35:46.822 --> 35:49.917
Different from Callen and Sam
or the others.

35:50.092 --> 35:53.653
What's the one ingredient
you'd say makes your partnership

35:53.829 --> 35:56.355
distinct from the rest?

35:59.234 --> 36:00.861
I don't know.

36:03.806 --> 36:09.176
Well, once you can answer that
truthfully to yourself,

36:10.546 --> 36:13.106
everything else
will become much clearer.

36:18.587 --> 36:21.318
They're not talking. Lawyered up
before we could zip-tie them.

36:21.490 --> 36:23.891
Both are former Special Forces,
both work for D-7.

36:24.059 --> 36:25.699
A private company
with a couple of billion

36:25.828 --> 36:27.990
in government contracts
supplying support services

36:28.163 --> 36:29.363
in hot spots around the world.

36:29.531 --> 36:31.522
We've already called in
for a search warrant.

36:31.700 --> 36:35.796
The evidence we'd need will be
long gone by then, if it isn't already.

36:35.971 --> 36:38.099
We have to work with what we have.

36:38.273 --> 36:40.073
Well, the guys in the boatshed
are small fish.

36:40.209 --> 36:43.144
They're well-trained, well-funded,
but they didn't order this.

36:43.312 --> 36:46.145
- That was somebody higher up.
- Who has access to technology

36:46.315 --> 36:48.409
that allows them
to intercept air traffic control

36:48.584 --> 36:51.110
and sabotage a private jet's
in-flight computer.

36:51.286 --> 36:53.653
Yeah, Hetty, this is a lot bigger
than we initially thought.

36:53.822 --> 36:56.223
I mean, we're talking war crimes
by private contractors.

36:56.391 --> 36:57.722
We'll get them,

36:57.893 --> 36:59.622
but today you caught two small fish,

36:59.795 --> 37:03.959
and sometimes small fish
are the most perfect bait for big fish.

37:04.133 --> 37:06.261
This is far from over.

37:06.435 --> 37:07.834
You did well today.

37:08.437 --> 37:11.566
Eric even managed
to keep his pants on.

37:11.740 --> 37:14.004
You can drop them off at Wardrobe.

37:14.476 --> 37:15.756
I can go back to wearing shorts?

37:15.911 --> 37:17.072
For a while.

37:17.746 --> 37:19.805
- It's a process.
- Uh-huh.

37:21.350 --> 37:23.876
I want a job where it's an
accomplishment to leave my pants on.

37:24.052 --> 37:26.578
I have sensitive thighs.

37:29.691 --> 37:30.852
He has sensitive thighs.

37:31.026 --> 37:32.187
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys.

37:32.361 --> 37:33.920
Guys, it's not funny.

37:34.096 --> 37:36.531
It's like restless leg syndrome
times a zillion.

37:36.698 --> 37:38.427
Good luck with that. Heh.

37:45.174 --> 37:46.767
I'm dead.

37:48.544 --> 37:50.376
I'm the one who cut them.

37:50.546 --> 37:52.640
I couldn't bear to see you suffer.

37:52.814 --> 37:54.213
What are we gonna do?

37:54.383 --> 37:56.374
Looks like we're going shopping,
Beale.

37:59.888 --> 38:05.827
So, what's the good word
on our Mr. Deeks?

38:06.261 --> 38:07.524
He's hurting.

38:07.696 --> 38:11.155
- Can he return to work?
- Yes.

38:11.733 --> 38:13.997
Whether he will or not
is a question for him.

38:14.169 --> 38:15.898
He's not sleeping.

38:16.071 --> 38:18.335
He can't work through this
if he doesn't get some rest.

38:20.142 --> 38:21.303
And his partner?

38:21.944 --> 38:24.879
It's a complicated relationship.

38:25.047 --> 38:27.379
Aren't they all?

38:28.383 --> 38:30.647
You asked me
if he could come back to work.

38:30.819 --> 38:34.016
And now I'm asking you
about his relationship with Kensi.

38:34.990 --> 38:36.685
Are you playing semantics with me?

38:40.229 --> 38:44.393
He's very close to his partner.

38:45.300 --> 38:48.429
Too close to return?

39:04.353 --> 39:06.321
I'm coming.

39:18.066 --> 39:19.932
- Hi.
- Hey.

39:20.969 --> 39:22.266
I've been calling.

39:22.437 --> 39:25.202
Yeah, I think
I must have had my phone off.

39:25.874 --> 39:27.103
Guess what reopened.

39:27.876 --> 39:29.275
Is that Yummy Yummy
Heart Attack?

39:29.444 --> 39:31.378
Yep, three Fs
from the Health Department

39:31.546 --> 39:32.911
and still going strong.

39:33.081 --> 39:36.051
Yeah, if F stood for fabulous.
Did you get the, uh, Drunken Pigs?

39:36.218 --> 39:38.186
With extra kimchi. You're welcome.

39:38.353 --> 39:39.752
I think I just felt a shiver.

39:39.921 --> 39:41.582
Want me to, uh, grab something
to drink?

39:41.757 --> 39:44.556
Oh, no, no, no.
I have got you covered, my friend.

39:44.726 --> 39:46.820
Wow. One day
you are gonna make somebody

39:46.995 --> 39:50.488
the perfect personal assistant.

39:52.901 --> 39:54.266
- Got a fork?
- I have a spork.

39:54.436 --> 39:56.700
Heh, yeah. Yeah, you do.

39:56.872 --> 39:57.998
All right.

39:58.173 --> 40:00.413
Oh, I have been waiting for this.
The smell in the car...

40:01.443 --> 40:03.070
Oh, are you kidding me?

40:03.245 --> 40:05.509
- I forgot how good this was.
- This is so good.

40:05.681 --> 40:07.547
- You think it's bad for us?
- Mm. Ah.

40:07.716 --> 40:09.309
You only live once. Ha.

40:09.484 --> 40:12.146
Yeah, probably a lot shorter
when you eat like this.

40:12.654 --> 40:14.088
- You got napkins?
- Mm-hm.

40:16.058 --> 40:19.358
- Is that dessert?
- Uh, no, it's nothing.

40:20.228 --> 40:22.026
You got me a cronut?

40:22.197 --> 40:24.825
Um, I did, but that was a while ago,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.332
and I left it at your doorstep,
so that's old.

40:27.502 --> 40:28.622
- Don't eat it.
- No, no, no.

40:28.770 --> 40:31.010
It's the thought that counts.
I'm gonna frame this thing.

40:31.173 --> 40:33.471
- You're so weird.
- I mean, look at that.

40:33.642 --> 40:36.134
It's like America and France
made slow, sweet love

40:36.311 --> 40:37.437
and then had a pastry baby.

40:37.612 --> 40:40.309
You sure you don't want a bite?

40:40.482 --> 40:43.243
- No. It's been out there for a while.
- I'll probably still eat that.

40:43.385 --> 40:44.784
Okay.

40:45.587 --> 40:48.181
So Burnt Offerings is on at 11.

40:51.193 --> 40:52.833
I don't really know
if I'm up for a movie.

40:52.994 --> 40:55.088
Oh, yes, you are
because I cannot watch this alone.

40:55.263 --> 40:57.789
It is rated triple-B.

40:57.966 --> 40:59.127
What's that?

40:59.301 --> 41:00.359
Blood, breasts and beasts.

41:01.036 --> 41:02.401
What was the last one?

41:02.571 --> 41:04.562
- Beasts.
- Well, you know how I like big beasts.

41:06.341 --> 41:08.173
Either way,
you're watching it with me.

41:08.343 --> 41:12.405
- I thought you loved horror movies.
- I do, just not by myself.

41:12.647 --> 41:15.776
Watch it with me. Watch it with me?
Watch it with me.

41:15.951 --> 41:17.476
You won me over
with the pastry baby.

41:17.652 --> 41:20.212
Ha, ha. Awesome, okay.

41:21.823 --> 41:23.382
Wanna use my cat pillow?

41:23.558 --> 41:26.118
It's pink. Very masculine.

41:27.629 --> 41:31.657
So Oliver Reed and Karen Black

41:31.833 --> 41:34.734
move into this mansion
with their son and their elderly aunt,

41:34.903 --> 41:37.838
played by Bette Davis,
who I absolutely love,

41:38.006 --> 41:40.668
and then Burgess Meredith,
who played Mickey in the Rocky films...

41:40.842 --> 41:41.922
It was so sad when he dies.

41:42.077 --> 41:43.704
Oh, my God,
it's the best scene ever.

41:43.879 --> 41:45.959
And his sister play the caretakers
of this mansion,

41:46.114 --> 41:47.206
and then their mother,

41:47.382 --> 41:50.943
she's like an elderly recluse
in the attic, and then...

41:53.588 --> 41:55.386
Flying monkeys
from The Wizard of Oz

41:55.557 --> 41:57.389
show up with guns,
and there's a big shootout.

41:57.993 --> 42:00.360
Mm, those monkeys are scary.

42:21.650 --> 42:23.675
What happens next?

42:26.121 --> 42:28.419
It's a love story.

42:30.325 --> 42:31.815
What?
