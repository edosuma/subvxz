00:01.680 --> 00:04.251
We escaped in a boat
with only a map and compass.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.721
You said you'd cure me, if I helped you.

00:06.800 --> 00:10.327
- I think I can help you find Helena.
-What are you doing here?

00:10.600 --> 00:12.807
Do you remember this guy? Ian Van Leer.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.691
According to Adele, they're all
funnelling funds into a Dyad shell,

00:15.760 --> 00:18.491
which has made payments
of hundreds of millions of dollars.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.210
What are they using that for, bribes?

00:20.280 --> 00:22.806
- It's controlled by this man here.
-Hashem Al-Khatib.

00:26.440 --> 00:29.250
SARAH:john Patrick Mathieson.
He's not 170.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.690
- Let's go, Siobhan.
-Thank you.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.090

(SIGHS)

02:15.320 --> 02:16.446
Ferdinand.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.690
You came back.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.045
How did you know?

02:26.960 --> 02:30.487
Shit, I passed out, sorry.
Is there any movement out there?

02:30.560 --> 02:31.971
Not a thing.

02:32.840 --> 02:35.650
It's too quiet. No, no, I don't like it.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.803
What's not to like?
Our friends are coming.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.565
- Get Kira up before you come up.
-Thank you.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.808
(TH EME MUSIC PLAYING)

03:22.160 --> 03:23.161
Kira?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.451
- KIRA: Coming!
-Come on, babe.

03:26.120 --> 03:29.886
- Right here. Okay.
-There's someone who wants to meet you.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.090
- That is Charlotte.
-Whoa.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.969
- Hi.
-She's gonna go with you to Art's

03:40.080 --> 03:41.491
till we see how things fall, yeah?

03:43.040 --> 03:45.202
So, you're what my mum looked like.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.930
Yeah. I never really think
about that any more.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.205
ART: Yeah, they'll be safer with my ex.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.169
Plus my daughter'll get
a kick out of it.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.641
I don't get it.
Why aren't the Neos after us?

03:53.720 --> 03:55.961
Yeah, Anger's AWOL, too.
There's no one on me.

03:56.040 --> 03:59.647
Rachel must've shown the cabal
our proof of P.T.'s real identity.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.326
Those men on the board,
they're realising they've been had.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.243
They're scrambling
to protect themselves.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.084
So finally Rachel's their target?

04:06.160 --> 04:07.969
Well, she's certainly a liability.

04:10.760 --> 04:12.922
- SARAH: Yeah, come on. Let's go, guys.
-(DOOR OPENS)

04:13.360 --> 04:15.442
-(MUSIC PLAYING IN BACKGROUND)
-(KEYS TAPPING)

04:15.520 --> 04:17.329
Hey, here's one.

04:17.839 --> 04:21.208
There is nothing
I wouldn't do for my friend.

04:21.279 --> 04:24.489
I have no notion
of doing things by halves.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.404
It's not my nature.
Can you guess who that is?

04:28.640 --> 04:31.325
It is Jane Austen.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.561
(scoffs)

04:34.000 --> 04:36.844
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's just
all this info from Europe shows

04:36.920 --> 04:39.844
a dozen countries
have pending legislation like Kuwait's.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.046
Hundreds of millions of people

04:41.120 --> 04:43.327
are about to be required
to submit their DNA,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.082
and Neolution is behind it.
They need that data.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.650
Okay, so you wanna spend the morning

04:47.720 --> 04:50.041
safeguarding the genetic future
of humankind,

04:50.120 --> 04:52.441
or do you wanna have brunch?

04:52.520 --> 04:54.921
We have a Skype date.
Siobhan wants a summit.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.563
- You calling them or what?
-They're calling us.

05:01.640 --> 05:04.120
"Us"? Why're you so bloody calm?

05:04.200 --> 05:05.929
Oh, wait for it, chicken.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.685
Hello, North American scum!

05:08.760 --> 05:11.240
-(LAUGHS)
-We bought a shit mountain of cheese.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.606
Welcome back.

05:13.520 --> 05:17.206
- Hey, you're home!
-Yeah, did you forget?

05:17.560 --> 05:19.608
Tomorrow's my big "coming out" party.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.360
<i>- Your art opening?
- An art opening?</i>

05:23.440 --> 05:26.046
Do you think
that's a good idea right now?

05:26.120 --> 05:29.408
- No, yes.
-It's an exceptional idea.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.244
And I'm really sorry
that you can't come, Cos.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.560
What? Why can't I come?

05:32.640 --> 05:35.041
<i>How're you gonna come?
You gonna dress up as Sarah?</i>

05:35.120 --> 05:36.804
This is my first show in two years.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.484
I'm not gonna have any kind
of sestra shenanigans.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.211
- I can't do it.
-He's got some big wheels coming in,

05:41.280 --> 05:43.681
Ezra Lue, this gallerist
that we met in Geneva.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.286
Adele's making appetizers,
the Hendrixes are helping set up,

05:46.360 --> 05:48.283
and you can totally come later
if you want to, I promise.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.124
I do. I do wanna come.

05:50.200 --> 05:54.046
But, Mum, if P.T.'s lost the board,
that means Neolution's on the ropes.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.364
Yeah, so well done, everyone.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.841
Felix and Adele, dirt well dug.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.809
Delphine, you showed us
what to do with it,

06:00.880 --> 06:02.484
and we deserve a breather tonight

06:02.560 --> 06:04.801
to stand down and support Felix.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.530
<i>I think you're right, Siobhan.</i>

06:06.600 --> 06:08.364
<i>- I think we've earned a break.</i>
- Have <i>we?</i>

06:09.120 --> 06:12.329
Well, it's settled. We're gonna take
the day off from crazy.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.604
CH RISSY: Thank you for letting me stay.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.967
I don't have a family any more.
I didn't know where else to go.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.481
What?

06:27.960 --> 06:29.530
When did Mark die?

06:31.080 --> 06:32.081
Two weeks ago.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.883
How did you find me again?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.082
Well, you told me
about Sister Irina, how she...

06:40.040 --> 06:41.530
That you and the other nuns
locked you up

06:41.600 --> 06:43.762
and how she came to the new world
after they cut out her tongue.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.081
You don't trust me?

06:51.880 --> 06:54.451
I don't blame you after
what my father did to you.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.646
He is dead.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.408
These are miracle babies.

07:02.440 --> 07:03.930
I'm sorry I came. I'll go.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.844
You still have family.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.486
You see?

07:18.200 --> 07:19.565
They remember you.

07:20.680 --> 07:21.681
(CHUCKLES)

07:22.320 --> 07:24.607
- They're saying hello.
-(CHUCKLES)

07:27.160 --> 07:29.891
All right.
Uh, how's Helena over here, Ali?

07:30.240 --> 07:31.241
It's fine with me!

07:31.800 --> 07:33.131
Yeah, but left, right?

07:33.200 --> 07:35.202
Like, where should she be
in relation to her sisters?

07:35.280 --> 07:36.486
Whatever you think.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.530
- Okay, this is a test right?
-(SCOFFS)

07:38.600 --> 07:39.647
I'm gonna do something,

07:39.760 --> 07:41.250
and then you're gonna lambaste me
for doing it wrong?

07:41.320 --> 07:44.369
No, I'm not gonna
micro-manage you, Donnie.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.848
- Is that what you're wearing?
-What's wrong with this?

07:46.920 --> 07:49.685
-(INHALES SHARPLY)
-Should I untuck? Would that be cooler?

07:49.760 --> 07:51.330
Donnie, it's perfect.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.970
I need a straight man behind the bar.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.963
Oh! Thank God you're here, Felix.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.009
Thank you! But you can't be.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.366
- What?
-Yeah.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.285
You'll need your sisters,
and I have a performance idea.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.521
Yeah, she brought the Korg.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.087
Oh, God, no.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.891
- You ready for that whisky, Adele?
-Oh, hell, yes.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.686
Just three fingers, please.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.205
Okay, we're not done here.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.726
We need to still go after
this Al-Khatib guy.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.485
The Neo bag man?
He controls their slush fund.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.722
I mean, he's so protective
it's not even funny.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.531
If he is bribing governments
for citizens' genetics,

08:23.600 --> 08:25.602
-then we've gotta...
-Leave it, love, will you?

08:25.680 --> 08:27.808
Why don't you help Adele
with the snacks?

08:27.880 --> 08:31.089
Oh, that would be great. I'm going
Southern Regional. We can catch up.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.169
Great. See you both at the opening.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.446
Where are you off to?

08:35.520 --> 08:37.124
I'm just, uh, going to get some flowers.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.645
- Mum!
-Chicken...

08:39.840 --> 08:42.491
You're a warrior, and I've told you
everything I know. And you're right.

08:42.559 --> 08:45.723
We can't stand down yet, but that's
exactly why I need you at the opening.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.371
Look out for your brother,
make sure there's no trouble.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.443
SCOTT: Okay, so that's 144
prepared doses of the inoculate.

08:56.520 --> 08:57.521
Yeah.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.001
Depending how much
of the cellular culture survived,

09:00.080 --> 09:02.686
-we can manufacture twice that again.
-Then what?

09:02.760 --> 09:04.364
You go around inoculating LEDAs with it?

09:04.440 --> 09:06.204
Yeah, that's the plan.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.930
But we still don't know
how many there are.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.490
Well, that's what we're gonna find out.

09:09.960 --> 09:10.961
Right, Scottie?

09:12.640 --> 09:14.927
- Where you going?
-Um, out.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.884
I thought we were all heading over
to Felix's together.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.923
I'll catch you guys later, okay?

09:19.800 --> 09:23.407
Sure. We have this whole
"don't ask, don't tell" thing going on.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.641
Ta.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.401
Hey.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.602
- You ready?
-Are you sure about this?

09:38.680 --> 09:40.887
Wouldn't it be safer if the others knew?

09:40.960 --> 09:42.724
We have one shot at this,

09:42.800 --> 09:46.202
and if it's gonna work, Sarah can't know
who we dealt with to get here.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.406
What about after?

09:47.480 --> 09:49.050
After you go to the opening
like nothing happened,

09:49.120 --> 09:52.044
then I will send you instructions there.
Are we good?

09:52.240 --> 09:53.401
- Yeah.
-Okay.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.927
I so love being
in the middle of all of this.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.960
(SIGHS)

10:12.400 --> 10:13.401
Um...

10:14.880 --> 10:15.881
Rachel.

10:21.440 --> 10:22.521
Rachel was rather impressed

10:22.600 --> 10:24.728
with our transgressive
little alliance, weren't you?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.321
It made me sick to work
with the man who killed MK.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.884
Sarah doesn't know
you two are here, does she?

10:30.960 --> 10:32.371
No, it's just the four of us.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.848
Our interests are very firmly aligned

10:35.040 --> 10:39.045
as you now have a nice, big,
fat target on your back, too.

10:39.480 --> 10:40.481
So...

10:41.480 --> 10:44.290
Neolution goes down for good,
or we all do.

10:45.760 --> 10:49.048
This is a summary of the evidence
we've amassed so far,

10:49.560 --> 10:51.085
but we need you to help us prove it.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.570
I'd like to talk to you. Alone.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.606
You'd be dead
if I hadn't called him in to save you.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.241
After you.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.324
So we spiked our Gluvine with vodka...

11:12.400 --> 11:14.482
Gluvine and intrigue. Nice.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.842
And, um, Felix and I,

11:16.920 --> 11:20.845
actually, got some serious apres-ski
cred by the end of it,

11:20.920 --> 11:22.365
but Delphine was, like, all business.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.010
What was S even
doing with her out there?

11:24.120 --> 11:25.963
I don't know, I mean
I only met her the once.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.691
- Who else was she meeting?
-I have no idea.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.367
And we don't have time for this.
We gotta get ready.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.685
Westmorland wants unprecedented access
to human genetics,

11:34.760 --> 11:38.162
and Hashem Al-Khatib was bribing
governments worldwide to get it.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.211
But you don't have record
of any of that, do you?

11:41.280 --> 11:46.207
No, but Neolution want to sell
curated commercialized evolution

11:46.280 --> 11:48.089
to the one percent who can afford it,

11:48.680 --> 11:52.127
so they can live forever,
grow a bloody tail if they want to.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.802
The rest of us, Coady's department,
targeted for sterilization.

11:58.280 --> 11:59.850
How's that sitting with you these days?

12:01.520 --> 12:03.966
You saved my granddaughter.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.807
I'm willing to take a gamble
on nature over nurture.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.170
This is all the supporting evidence
to our claims.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.124
Without proof of bribes,

12:18.840 --> 12:21.207
it will barely carry a news cycle.

12:21.480 --> 12:22.766
You're a smart woman, Rachel.

12:22.840 --> 12:26.925
Like any good CEO,
you kept a shadow file.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.761
A record of where the bodies are buried.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.921
Give me the proof I need
to back this up.

12:34.960 --> 12:36.246
Give yourself a chance

12:37.320 --> 12:38.890
to be truly free.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.686
<i>ALI: Let Cos/ma make an appearance!
FELIX: No.</i>

12:44.760 --> 12:46.091
- Yes!
-I'm not gonna do that.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.969
What I need is for you
to leave right now

12:48.040 --> 12:50.327
before people start arriving,
and something clone-y happens.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.687
- Alison...
-Look all around you.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.721
It's already happening.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.201
- Right?
-(CHUCKLES)

13:05.960 --> 13:06.961
Oh...

13:07.800 --> 13:09.802
- Hey. Collin.
-Hello, Felix.

13:10.520 --> 13:11.521
Hello.

13:12.040 --> 13:15.203
- Oof, I've come early.
-And often, I remember.

13:15.280 --> 13:16.281
Hmm.

Do you have any idea how hard
your brother's been working for tonight?

if it helps chill you out,

39:03.200 --> 39:04.201
(GRUNTS)

39:06.720 --> 39:08.370
Quite enough lip out of you.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.046
(GAGGING)

39:11.080 --> 39:12.081
(GROAN5)

39:19.400 --> 39:21.368
You know, as a woman,

39:21.880 --> 39:25.362
I'm 14% more likely to survive

39:25.440 --> 39:27.169
a gunshot wound than you.

39:28.720 --> 39:30.529
Maybe not this one but...

39:31.600 --> 39:33.568
Okay, it's been a good one.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.210
Chickens.

40:03.080 --> 40:05.606
<i>COSXMA". Guys, you have any idea
how insane this plan is?</i>

40:05.680 --> 40:07.489
Do you realise how many things
could go wrong?

40:07.560 --> 40:09.050
I'm sorry for your loss.

40:09.120 --> 40:11.930
Save your bloody breath
you heartless bitch and turn around.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.009
I will cleanse them from this Earth.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.406
The future is female!
