00:08.768 --> 00:10.736
<i>The Illusionist</i> blows it
out of the water.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.871
You're kidding.
Ed Norton sucks.

00:12.905 --> 00:15.207
- I'm not defending ed Norton.
- What about the title?

00:15.241 --> 00:17.508
He's not even a real magician.
He's an illusionist?

00:17.543 --> 00:21.379
You watch your mouth.

00:21.413 --> 00:25.650
"Adam 'Dwayne <i>the rock</i>
roommate demamp'"?

00:25.684 --> 00:28.153
All right.

00:30.089 --> 00:32.624
Aah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Whoa, no, no, no.

00:32.658 --> 00:35.560
I am so sorry.
I was not expecting anybody.

00:35.594 --> 00:37.462
- It's move-in day.
- Oh, wow, okay.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.064
Pointing fingers already.

00:39.098 --> 00:40.932
Not a good start
to our relationship.

00:40.967 --> 00:42.234
Hope you don't mind,
I already kinda

00:42.268 --> 00:44.402
laid claim to this squadrent.

00:44.436 --> 00:46.704
That's great,
'cause I got the microwave,

00:46.739 --> 00:48.206
and I'll just
put it there, so...

00:48.241 --> 00:52.610
Sick. I love popcorn, so...

00:52.645 --> 00:53.779
Hey. Greetings, earthlings.

00:53.813 --> 00:55.947
Anders Holmvik,
resident advisor.

00:55.982 --> 00:58.150
- Hi, I'm Blake.
- Blake.

00:58.184 --> 01:00.886
What's up? I'm Adam.
Demamp.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.754
Uh, you play sports.

01:02.789 --> 01:04.355
- Swim team.
- So no?

01:04.390 --> 01:06.124
Sorry, that was...

01:06.159 --> 01:08.226
that was a funny one.
- Oh, yeah? That's funny?

01:08.261 --> 01:10.395
You know what's not funny?
Burning alive

01:10.429 --> 01:11.663
in the middle of the night
because you don't know

01:11.697 --> 01:13.064
your microwave
just caught on fire.

01:13.099 --> 01:14.800
Microwaves, not allowed
in the dorm.

01:14.834 --> 01:16.802
So I'll be taking this,
because I'm your R.A.

01:16.836 --> 01:18.069
Hey, no,
I didn't mean all that.

01:18.104 --> 01:19.370
Come on, man,
just gimme a break.

01:19.405 --> 01:21.306
There are no breaks
in college!

01:21.340 --> 01:24.142
Oh, hey, hey, hey!
Cut it out! Pull those up!

01:24.177 --> 01:26.444
I'm sorry, I was
so close to finishing

01:26.478 --> 01:27.979
when you came in, initially.

01:28.014 --> 01:29.214
You're lucky
I don't write you up.

01:29.248 --> 01:31.349
All right, you two are

01:31.383 --> 01:33.484
on my s-[Bleep]-[Bleep]-t list.

01:33.519 --> 01:34.652
And it's a short list.

01:34.687 --> 01:39.691
It's too long.
T-o-o long.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.626
Welcome to college.

01:41.660 --> 01:45.297
But that's my microwave!

01:45.331 --> 01:46.932
Greetings, earthlings.

01:46.966 --> 01:48.967
Anders Holmvik,
resident advisor.

01:49.001 --> 01:51.236
So are you gonna be
turned around for a while,

01:51.270 --> 01:52.938
or...

01:58.010 --> 02:00.545
♪ it's always times like these
when I think of you ♪

02:00.579 --> 02:05.083
♪ and I wonder if you ever
think of me ♪

02:05.117 --> 02:08.286
what to do to die today
at a minute or two to two.

02:08.321 --> 02:11.756
Hey, dude,
they give you pudding, man.

02:11.790 --> 02:13.524
- Hey, dude.
- You go in the cafeteria,

02:13.559 --> 02:14.960
and you just swipe a card,
and they give you

02:14.994 --> 02:16.627
as much pudding as you want.
Oh, cool.

02:16.662 --> 02:18.129
- What's this, your schedule?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:18.164 --> 02:21.699
What's up with all
this theater, man?

02:21.734 --> 02:24.936
Well, I'm a theater major,
so...

02:24.971 --> 02:27.572
yeah, I caught the acting bug
pretty bad.

02:27.606 --> 02:30.275
But yeah, I already auditioned
for the fall production...

02:30.309 --> 02:32.143
<i>les miserables.</i>
- That's cool.

02:32.178 --> 02:34.379
So can you, like,
cry on command and stuff?

02:34.413 --> 02:36.114
Oh, yeah, it's easy.

02:36.148 --> 02:38.149
Think of something really sad
real quick.

02:38.184 --> 02:39.784
Like, a bundle of babies
exploding,

02:39.818 --> 02:41.486
or, like, dogs exploding.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.654
Or, like... like, maybe
your mom's really sick,

02:43.689 --> 02:46.958
or you, like, walked in
on, like... on her rape

02:46.993 --> 02:49.060
you now, stop him...
you can't stop him

02:49.095 --> 02:50.428
because he's bigger than you.

02:50.462 --> 02:53.631
Like, you just think of that...

02:57.303 --> 03:01.907
Oh, that hit so close
to home for me.

03:01.941 --> 03:04.575
My dog actually exploded
when I was a kid.

03:04.610 --> 03:06.177
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
- It's okay.

03:06.212 --> 03:08.746
You are a really good actor.
Thank you.

03:08.781 --> 03:10.248
You're like
Seann Williams Scott.

03:10.283 --> 03:11.582
You're at
a Seann Williams Scott level.

03:11.617 --> 03:13.018
Thank you. Thank you.

03:13.052 --> 03:14.585
Well, you know,
it's just living truthfully

03:14.620 --> 03:17.355
in imaginary circumstances,
and whatever.

03:17.390 --> 03:19.824
Enough about me.
What's... what's on your schedule?

03:19.858 --> 03:23.194
Oh, me...
Women's sexuality,

03:23.229 --> 03:26.564
sexual revolution,
the human body,

03:26.598 --> 03:28.967
remedial math...

03:29.001 --> 03:30.969
The Bible as literature.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.737
I'm doing that for my gf.

03:32.771 --> 03:35.606
Get the heck out of here.
You already scored a girlfriend?

03:35.641 --> 03:37.142
Oh, no,
she's back in high school.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.910
We're, like, crazy religious,
though.

03:38.945 --> 03:41.512
We always get on our knees...
And pray to Jesus.

03:41.547 --> 03:43.348
Not orally, please.
Oh.

03:43.382 --> 03:45.250
You know, she's actually
coming next weekend.

03:45.284 --> 03:47.585
We'll go see you act the [Bleep]
out of that play, dude.

03:47.619 --> 03:49.187
Uh, that's not for a while.

03:49.221 --> 03:52.023
Plus, I already got cast
as, like, a police officer.

03:52.058 --> 03:54.326
I'm just in the background.
I don't even have lines.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.626
- What?
- Yeah, I know.

03:55.661 --> 03:57.028
It's just a popularity contest

03:57.063 --> 03:58.196
when you get down to it.

03:58.230 --> 03:59.965
Whoa, man.

03:59.999 --> 04:02.000
I'm, like, the most
popular dude in my high school

04:02.034 --> 04:03.534
now that I've graduated
high school,

04:03.569 --> 04:07.472
and I am throwing you...
A party, bro,

04:07.506 --> 04:09.807
so you can infiltrate
that theater-nerd crew.

04:09.842 --> 04:11.176
Like in <i>mean girls.</i>

04:11.210 --> 04:12.643
Yes!

04:12.678 --> 04:15.013
You know,<i>Mean girls</i> is
my favorite movie.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.613
It's mine too.

04:16.648 --> 04:18.116
The DVD special
commentary...

04:18.149 --> 04:19.784
- Oh!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my...

04:19.817 --> 04:21.819
- listen to it.
Lindsay just tells all.

04:21.853 --> 04:22.954
Oh, yeah.

04:22.989 --> 04:24.755
Tina fey.

04:24.790 --> 04:26.791
You growing your hair out
for <i>Jesus Christ superstar?</i>

04:26.825 --> 04:28.126
That's really cool.
It looks great.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.660
That's dedication.
I love it.

04:29.695 --> 04:31.963
How about we celebrate
my first night in college

04:31.998 --> 04:34.399
with a little...
Finger sinning?

04:34.433 --> 04:35.566
You're so bad.

04:35.601 --> 04:36.634
- We could try for two.
- Stop.

04:36.668 --> 04:37.935
I wanna try two.

04:37.970 --> 04:39.971
You wanna try two?
Oh, my gosh.

04:40.006 --> 04:41.572
Adam. Adam.

04:41.607 --> 04:43.441
The student director
of <i>les mis,</i> he's here.

04:43.476 --> 04:45.510
He actually came.
Yes!

04:45.544 --> 04:47.745
Cranium?
The children's game?

04:47.779 --> 04:48.846
No, thank you.

04:48.881 --> 04:50.148
This is great, dude.

04:50.182 --> 04:51.682
This is exactly why
we threw the party.

04:51.717 --> 04:53.118
Oh, no, I can't do it, man.

04:53.152 --> 04:54.919
I'm gonna blow it again.
I'm too nervous.

04:54.953 --> 04:56.121
Don't get nervous.

04:56.155 --> 04:58.523
Smoke a little chron-chron,
my baby.

04:58.557 --> 05:00.191
I've never tried it.

05:00.226 --> 05:03.495
I have a bevy of mixers
off-campus to attend.

05:03.529 --> 05:05.497
Do you know about
off-campus?

05:05.531 --> 05:06.564
Or are you only aware
of the world

05:06.598 --> 05:07.999
immediately in front of you?

05:08.034 --> 05:10.068
Yes, look at that,
it's time for me to go.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.403
It's showtime, bro-time.

05:11.437 --> 05:14.939
Uh, actually,
wait right here.

05:14.973 --> 05:16.674
Uhoh, guys,

05:16.708 --> 05:19.411
I wonder who's knick-knocking
on our door.

05:19.445 --> 05:21.712
Who's here right now?
This is weird, because

05:21.747 --> 05:23.748
all my friends are here.
Is it...

05:23.782 --> 05:27.352
<i>The</i> Napoleon dynamite?

05:27.386 --> 05:30.755
Gosh! Gosh...

05:30.789 --> 05:33.358
Gosh.

05:33.392 --> 05:34.559
Gosh!

05:34.593 --> 05:36.961
Wow, he is a true talent.

05:36.995 --> 05:38.663
You should probably cast him

05:38.697 --> 05:39.730
in the miserable lesbian play
you're doing.

05:39.765 --> 05:40.731
Mm, no.

05:40.766 --> 05:42.700
Come on, Tina,
eat your dinner,

05:42.734 --> 05:44.635
you fat tub of lard!

05:44.670 --> 05:46.304
From the movie!
Tina, from the mo...

05:46.338 --> 05:48.706
- Thanks. Vote for Pedro.

05:48.740 --> 05:49.974
That was a funny part...
"liger."

05:50.008 --> 05:51.042
What the hell is going on
in here?

05:51.077 --> 05:52.743
Why is everyone clapping?

05:52.778 --> 05:54.546
Is that music?
Chill out, man.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.914
Take a seat, grab a beer.
You know what? It's 9:30,

05:56.949 --> 05:58.649
and you live
on the swim team floor.

05:58.684 --> 06:01.219
We hit the water at 6:00 A.M.
for an 800 skip 'em.

06:01.253 --> 06:03.221
Which means lights out
at 10:00.

06:03.255 --> 06:05.056
Which tells me you need
to brush your teeth

06:05.091 --> 06:06.291
and get on your jammy-jams.

06:06.325 --> 06:08.093
Hey, come on, man.

06:08.127 --> 06:09.660
You're being a frikkin' idiot!

06:09.695 --> 06:10.962
I'm not an idiot.
I'm a smart person.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.097
Everybody out of here.
Come on!

06:12.131 --> 06:13.364
See you at class tomorrow.

06:13.399 --> 06:15.333
I'm remembering
all your faces.

06:15.367 --> 06:17.569
Scanning them now.

06:17.603 --> 06:19.404
Hey, babe.

06:19.438 --> 06:21.872
Um, I'll just drive home
and come back next weekend.

06:21.907 --> 06:24.442
I swear to you,
next weekend...

06:24.477 --> 06:28.012
I'm gonna finger bang you
so good... I swear to God.

06:28.046 --> 06:30.081
Or other stuff, you know.
It depen...

06:30.116 --> 06:32.049
whatever you want to...
okay. How do you feel?

06:32.084 --> 06:33.684
That girl's probably
gonna kill herself

06:33.719 --> 06:34.952
because I don't get
to finger bang her.

06:34.987 --> 06:36.821
- Sure.
- Yeah, what the heck, man!

06:36.855 --> 06:38.456
I was just about to do
the tetherball scene!

06:38.491 --> 06:39.690
And then you came in
and made me look like

06:39.725 --> 06:41.326
an amateur
in front of my director.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.760
Yeah, you're crampin'
our stees.

06:42.794 --> 06:44.295
You know what's amateur?

06:44.330 --> 06:45.896
Doing a Napoleon dynamite
impression

06:45.931 --> 06:48.199
and not wearing moon boots.
Oh...

06:48.234 --> 06:49.767
Welcome to college...
Again.

06:49.801 --> 06:51.603
Lights out, girls.

06:51.637 --> 06:53.838
Lights out.
Holmvik.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.807
You shut down that party?
Oh, hey, Lance, yeah.

06:56.842 --> 06:58.376
Dude, I went in there,
and I was, like,

06:58.410 --> 06:59.910
"Who's clapping?

06:59.945 --> 07:01.812
Why are you clapping?"
Then I heard music,

07:01.847 --> 07:03.214
and I couldn't find it at first,
but then I found it...

07:03.249 --> 07:05.082
I shut it off,
so we can hit the hay.

07:05.117 --> 07:06.618
Actually,
me and the distance guys are

07:06.652 --> 07:07.918
getting in there
first thing in the morning,

07:07.953 --> 07:09.154
so you need to run
down to the pool

07:09.188 --> 07:10.721
and change the lanes
to short course.

07:10.756 --> 07:12.056
Wait, what if...

07:12.090 --> 07:13.724
what if we woke up
some of the freshmen

07:13.759 --> 07:15.326
and made them do it?
Freak 'em out, right?

07:15.361 --> 07:17.495
And go, "you gotta
go change the Lane lines now!"

07:17.530 --> 07:19.764
- Is that a joke?
- No.

07:19.798 --> 07:21.098
Dude, you know that hazing
is a really serious offense?

07:21.133 --> 07:22.967
- Right.
- If I wanted a joke,

07:23.001 --> 07:24.602
I would turn on <i>mind of mencia,</i>

07:24.637 --> 07:26.638
and I would just
laugh my shaft off.

07:26.672 --> 07:29.174
All right, well,
I'll just, uh...

07:29.208 --> 07:30.308
I'll go change
those Lane lines.

07:30.342 --> 07:31.409
Yeah. Thanks, man.
Oh-ho!

07:31.443 --> 07:32.877
- Ow.
- And you know what?

07:32.911 --> 07:33.978
You should probably lay off
the enchiladas

07:34.012 --> 07:36.247
in the caf.
Oh, okay.

07:36.282 --> 07:39.284
I will... If you do.

07:39.318 --> 07:40.451
'Cause I think you need
to lay off

07:40.486 --> 07:42.387
the enchiladas in the caf.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.322
No, Holmvik, I'm not joking.

07:44.356 --> 07:47.825
You're growing tits.

07:47.859 --> 07:50.161
Oh, all right...

07:50.196 --> 07:52.263
I'll lay off.

07:58.215 --> 08:02.336
Guy totally ruined
my dynamite Napoleon impression.

08:02.585 --> 08:04.453
Now what?

08:04.487 --> 08:06.355
I'm working on Shrek, but...

08:06.389 --> 08:09.292
It's years away, donkey.

08:09.326 --> 08:13.342
Jesus Christ...
You ooze talent.

08:13.748 --> 08:15.516
That was disgusting.

08:15.550 --> 08:17.217
And I can't even concentrate
on that

08:17.251 --> 08:19.085
because I'm too busy
hating that dude.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.654
I don't blame the guy,
though.

08:20.688 --> 08:22.455
He's cranky 'cause he has to
wake up so early

08:22.490 --> 08:23.857
for swim practice.

08:23.892 --> 08:25.878
You know what?

08:26.174 --> 08:29.344
Maybe we need to make it
so that he never, ever wakes up

08:29.378 --> 08:31.011
for swim practice again.

08:31.046 --> 08:34.881
One time I went swimming
in, like, the neighbor's pool

08:34.916 --> 08:36.683
when they had just shocked it
with chlorine.

08:36.719 --> 08:38.620
My skin got all fiery red,

08:38.654 --> 08:40.520
and my hair straightened out
for, like, a month.

08:40.556 --> 08:42.523
When I was a toddler,
I actually fell

08:42.558 --> 08:44.559
into a washing machine
full of bleach,

08:44.593 --> 08:45.993
and I didn't get itchy at all.

08:46.027 --> 08:49.297
I did die, though...
For, like, four minutes.

08:49.331 --> 08:50.965
The doctors said
they couldn't believe

08:50.999 --> 08:52.700
how much brain damage
I didn't get.

08:52.735 --> 08:54.669
They were, like,
really impressed.

08:54.703 --> 08:57.305
That was fun. You wanna do
another story battle?

08:57.339 --> 08:59.574
I kicked your ass.

08:59.608 --> 09:00.908
No. I just brought that up
because I thought

09:00.942 --> 09:03.344
we could maybe shock <i>this</i> pool.

09:03.379 --> 09:05.580
Good ide...
you should have just said that.

09:05.614 --> 09:06.814
Now we're talking.

09:06.848 --> 09:08.983
One of these has <i>got</i>
to do the trick.

09:09.017 --> 09:12.587
There's, like,
60 more back there, man.

09:12.621 --> 09:13.888
All right.

09:13.922 --> 09:15.523
You think this is funny?

09:15.557 --> 09:18.225
I just send you down
to change the lanes,

09:18.260 --> 09:19.527
and you poison the whole team?

09:19.561 --> 09:21.362
Look at Freddy.

09:21.397 --> 09:23.431
I didn't do this.
I swear.

09:23.465 --> 09:24.666
And you know what,
I'm not ready to lose

09:24.700 --> 09:26.066
to another [Bleep] vanderkaay,

09:26.101 --> 09:27.602
so, Anders...

09:27.636 --> 09:29.837
There's a chain of command
in swimming,

09:29.871 --> 09:32.373
and you are off the chain.
Thank you.

09:32.408 --> 09:35.743
No, I mean that
you're off the team.

09:35.778 --> 09:38.913
- What? Coach?
- Empty out your locker.

09:38.947 --> 09:41.416
You're gone!

09:41.450 --> 09:43.318
Get your tits off this deck!

09:43.352 --> 09:46.086
- Softy. The big softy.
- Mm-hmm.

09:46.121 --> 09:48.690
Hey, there.
What's the matter?

09:48.724 --> 09:50.792
Swim practice canceled?

09:50.826 --> 09:53.160
Uh, yeah.

09:53.195 --> 09:55.330
That's cool. At least
you get to sleep in, right?

09:55.364 --> 09:58.633
Actually, they, um...
They kicked me off the team

09:58.667 --> 10:01.803
and took my scholarship, so...

10:01.837 --> 10:03.237
I'm kinda screwed since
my dad's making me

10:03.271 --> 10:05.906
pay my way through school.
Whatever.

10:05.941 --> 10:09.510

10:11.647 --> 10:14.014
Hey, we just wanted
to check on you

10:14.049 --> 10:15.783

pretty hard in the shower.

10:15.818 --> 10:17.852

and help me

10:17.886 --> 10:19.420
Polish off this case,

10:19.455 --> 10:21.422
seeing as that I'm not even
your R.A. Anymore.

10:21.457 --> 10:23.057
- All right.
- Yeah, come on in.

10:23.091 --> 10:25.526
These were actually
our beers from before, so...

10:25.561 --> 10:27.061

- Yeah, these are ours.

10:27.095 --> 10:28.596
Sorry.

13:40.193 --> 13:42.494
he's already seen
that I can do comedy,

13:42.528 --> 13:44.629
so I prepared
a dramatic piece for him.

13:44.664 --> 13:47.132
So I'm gonna do
this stirring monologue

13:47.167 --> 13:51.170
from Tim curry in the
quintessential film <i>Congo.</i>

13:51.204 --> 13:52.776
It's an American classic.
Mmhmm.

13:52.794 --> 13:54.334
You have no reason
to be nervous.

13:54.353 --> 13:56.741
I'm the one who's about
to propose to my girlfriend.

13:56.776 --> 13:58.944
- What?
- A lifelong commitment.

13:58.978 --> 14:00.245

to the one dude?

So you, like, really love her.

14:15.376 --> 14:17.544

14:37.264 --> 14:38.832
Yeah, I guess.

- You need a friend?
- Oh, nah.

14:41.469 --> 14:43.269
Bleh! No. Don't do it.

to do that, or...

14:49.510 --> 14:50.810
- no, I was born with that.
- Oh, okay.

14:50.845 --> 14:52.278
Then, yeah,
I'll give it a shot.

14:52.312 --> 14:53.980

- Oh!

I'm proposing to you.

15:45.433 --> 15:46.933
You know what, Adam,

15:46.967 --> 15:48.601
I think we should take
some time off.

15:48.636 --> 15:49.702
And I'll pray for you.

15:49.737 --> 15:52.004
You'll be in my prayers.

15:52.039 --> 15:53.773
You still want me to call you
out of class on Tuesday?

15:53.808 --> 15:55.274
I'll take you to sonic.

It's stupid.

16:03.818 --> 16:05.919

a really great time.

16:07.922 --> 16:09.489

Smoke weed until you die.
That's right. That's right.

16:57.337 --> 16:59.739
Now, why don't you go
direct yourself over

16:59.773 --> 17:03.075
to the snack shack
and get daddy some airheads?

17:03.110 --> 17:04.511
Bounce, man.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.512
Okay, I will bounce,
thank you.

17:06.547 --> 17:07.946
- Bye.
- That was good, man.

17:07.982 --> 17:09.848
Acting's for chicks, anyways.

17:09.884 --> 17:11.250
Yo, dudes, check it out.

17:11.284 --> 17:14.286
One semester in cash.
We did it.

17:14.320 --> 17:15.922
Oh, man, that is so awesome

17:15.955 --> 17:19.090
because I was feeling
very guilty about that.

17:19.126 --> 17:20.760
Why are you feeling
guilty, man?

17:20.794 --> 17:23.896
- Well...
- Poon! Poon!

17:23.931 --> 17:26.499
Whoo!
I'm on the sex train!

17:26.534 --> 17:28.801
Oh, he's pounding
the beef out of her.

17:28.836 --> 17:31.470
This is my life!
This is my life right now!

17:31.505 --> 17:32.805
- Don't stop.
- Whoo!

17:32.840 --> 17:35.207
- Welcome to college.
- Pooooon!

17:35.242 --> 17:38.344
Oh!
Aah!

17:38.378 --> 17:40.312
Oh, doin' her doggy...
good night!

17:40.347 --> 17:46.385
My bad. Yo, guys,
check me out.

17:46.420 --> 17:49.522
Dude... Yeah!

17:51.158 --> 17:53.960
You see that?
That's my guy.

17:53.994 --> 17:56.295
This is everything
I've ever wanted.

17:56.329 --> 17:57.730
That's it, I gotta do it.
I'm next.

17:57.765 --> 17:59.331
I'm jumping off that thing next.
Do it.

17:59.366 --> 18:02.134
No, you're not.
This party's over.

18:02.169 --> 18:04.971
This pool is ours, and you guys
all gotta get out of here.

18:05.005 --> 18:06.606
No, we're not
going anywhere, okay.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.240
This party's gonna go
all night, right?

18:10.778 --> 18:14.113
Yeah, all right,
I could let the party ride out.

18:14.147 --> 18:15.582
Cool. Thanks.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.383
- If you pay me.
- Hey!

18:17.417 --> 18:19.686
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's his money.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.287
We... we earned that.

18:21.321 --> 18:22.956
Lance, I'm not your bitch
any more, all right?

18:22.990 --> 18:27.060
Give it back.
Take it from me.

18:27.094 --> 18:28.962
I got a better idea.

18:28.996 --> 18:33.666
Why don't we settle this
like men... And swim for it?

18:33.701 --> 18:35.234
Whoa!

18:39.873 --> 18:42.675
Whooooah...
It that, like, a swimmer thing?

18:42.710 --> 18:44.811
No, I didn't expect him
to do that also.

18:44.845 --> 18:45.979
Damn it.

18:46.013 --> 18:47.914
♪ Skinny boy's in the place

18:52.867 --> 18:56.103
that's it, Holmvik,
you're about to get lapped.

18:56.137 --> 18:57.405
Suck my wake.

18:57.439 --> 18:59.840
God, swimming trash talk
is horrible.

18:59.874 --> 19:03.644
Okay, now we're gonna, uh,
do the swim race.

19:03.679 --> 19:07.080
In three, two...

19:07.115 --> 19:08.416
Go, start swimming now!

19:08.450 --> 19:10.250
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

19:13.355 --> 19:15.289
Swimming!
Yeah.

19:15.324 --> 19:20.494
Go, Anders.
Go, Anders!

19:20.529 --> 19:21.995
Go, Anders!

19:22.030 --> 19:23.831
Come on, Anders!

19:28.770 --> 19:30.538
I thought that was gonna
be it.

19:30.572 --> 19:32.039
This is a lot of swimming.
Yeah, I mean...

19:32.073 --> 19:34.074
- how much longer
do we have to watch this?

19:34.108 --> 19:37.177
This is boring.
Wanna smoke some weed?

19:37.212 --> 19:38.546
Yes, I will do anything

19:38.580 --> 19:40.348
besides watch
these two naked dudes swim.

19:40.382 --> 19:43.116
All right, everybody stay
right where you are.

19:43.151 --> 19:47.020
- Oh... No... no running.
- Stop!

19:47.055 --> 19:48.556
No running.

19:48.590 --> 19:50.524
Hey, tell everybody
that we threw this party.

19:50.559 --> 19:52.426
All right, let's go, Anders,
you got this.

19:52.461 --> 19:53.594
You versus you.

19:53.628 --> 19:55.563
Oh, all right.
Hey. Ow.

19:55.597 --> 19:58.699
- Okay. Jesus.
- Did I win?

19:58.734 --> 20:01.369
Kicked off campus.

20:01.403 --> 20:03.070
Wow, I did not see that
coming.

20:03.104 --> 20:05.539
Whatever, man. Who wants
to live in the dorms anyways?

20:05.574 --> 20:08.509
It sucks. Now we can party
like last night every night.

20:08.543 --> 20:10.277
I'm gonna drink
and have sex so much

20:10.311 --> 20:12.380
I'm probably gonna puke
out my dick!

20:12.414 --> 20:13.947
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

20:13.982 --> 20:16.684
Yeah, okay, well,
living off-campus is expensive.

20:16.718 --> 20:17.951
We might as well check out
one of these jobs.

20:17.986 --> 20:19.420
Hello.
Hello.

20:19.454 --> 20:20.855
Oh, hi, guys.

20:20.889 --> 20:23.791
I hope you'll consider applying
to Telamericorp.

20:23.825 --> 20:26.627
You know, telemarketing can be
a very lucrative

20:26.661 --> 20:28.696
part-time job for a student.

20:28.730 --> 20:30.598
- Ha ha, no, thanks.
- Yeah.

20:30.632 --> 20:32.299
I don't think we need
to be on the phones,

20:32.333 --> 20:34.535
cold-calling strangers
and selling steak knives or...

20:34.569 --> 20:35.770
I don't know what you do.
- Yeah.

20:35.804 --> 20:37.705
We have our whole lives
ahead of us,

20:37.739 --> 20:41.041
which are more than likely
gonna be <i>sick!</i>

20:41.075 --> 20:42.309
Yeah.

20:42.343 --> 20:43.778
Do you guys drug test?

20:43.812 --> 20:45.012
- Yeah.
- Of course.

20:45.046 --> 20:46.647
Oh!

20:46.681 --> 20:48.516
Oh, hey! That was...

20:48.550 --> 20:51.118
see, I told you that would
happen if you wore that.

20:51.152 --> 20:53.353
Is it cool if I just
hang out with you guys here?

20:53.388 --> 20:55.322
Nice!
