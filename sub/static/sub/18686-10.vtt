WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:05.675
Previously on Beyond...

00:05.676 --> 00:07.387
You swear on the sacred
holy covenant of brotherhood?

00:07.388 --> 00:09.259
I swear on the holy sacred
covenant of brotherhood.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.181
I connected to this machine.

00:11.182 --> 00:12.432
I can feel it.

00:12.433 --> 00:14.134
No!

00:14.135 --> 00:16.136
No! Stop! Stop it!

00:16.137 --> 00:17.058
I had you!

00:17.059 --> 00:18.478
And then you were gone.

00:18.479 --> 00:20.940
You're not making any sense.
What we had was real.

00:20.941 --> 00:22.312
It's just complicated.

00:22.313 --> 00:23.793
Let me know
when you UN-complicate it.

00:24.775 --> 00:25.945
Ow! Mm!

00:25.946 --> 00:27.817
- At last.
- Isaac Frost.

00:27.818 --> 00:29.409
I could hardly wait to meet you.

00:29.410 --> 00:31.072
Cool logo.
Is that your company?

00:32.153 --> 00:33.703
Congregations
need somewhere to congregate.

00:33.704 --> 00:37.157
Don't make a move until I figure out
just what the hell we're walking into.

00:37.158 --> 00:39.709
Whatever it is you're going
through, we go through it together.

00:39.710 --> 00:41.501
It's a lot to explain.

00:41.502 --> 00:44.124
Right now, we need
to get Willa and get out.

00:44.125 --> 00:45.925
You want to reach
the Ocean of Light?

00:45.926 --> 00:48.218
Let Holden go,
and I'll take you.

00:48.219 --> 00:50.130
I saw the most beautiful light.

00:50.131 --> 00:51.131
There was a bridge.

00:51.132 --> 00:53.553
26 years ago, I lost the
only woman I ever loved.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.476
She's in there, waiting for me
on the other side of the bridge.

00:56.477 --> 00:59.059
What greater motivation
than love?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.482
Are we ready?

01:02.603 --> 01:03.854
Let's go.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:23.294 --> 01:25.166
Don't give up in there.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.048
I'm coming, just stay strong.

01:39.890 --> 01:42.021
There's no reason to be nervous.

01:42.022 --> 01:44.314
There's every reason
to be nervous.

01:44.315 --> 01:46.526
This machine is untested.

01:46.527 --> 01:49.189
Our entire foundation
is built upon him

01:49.190 --> 01:51.191
being able to cross this bridge.

01:51.192 --> 01:53.233
What if he can't?
What if something happens?

01:53.234 --> 01:54.575
I'll be fine.

01:55.576 --> 01:56.997
And Hollow Sky?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.000
Our investors
are getting anxious.

02:02.042 --> 02:03.503
Everyone who has walked
through those gates

02:03.504 --> 02:06.086
did so because they believed.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.919
I need you to believe too.

02:11.011 --> 02:12.752
By the end of today,

02:12.753 --> 02:16.055
we'll have an answer
to life's greatest mystery.

02:16.056 --> 02:18.219
Tomorrow, we share it
with the world.

02:19.930 --> 02:21.892
Prometheus shared fire
with the world...

02:23.023 --> 02:25.896
and a bird ate his liver
for all of eternity.

02:28.229 --> 02:31.531
When they write the book detailing
our achievement here today,

02:31.532 --> 02:33.194
maybe don't mention that.

02:44.375 --> 02:46.417
She gave you that, didn't she?

02:48.209 --> 02:49.749
Belonged to her mother

02:49.750 --> 02:51.751
before Willa was even born.

02:51.752 --> 02:53.053
How do you know that?

02:55.886 --> 02:58.008
Because she's my daughter.

03:00.060 --> 03:03.062
So you see, I've got just
as much at stake as you do.

03:03.063 --> 03:05.225
You and Arthur,

03:05.226 --> 03:07.067
you don't care who you hurt.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.731
I actually care about Willa.

03:14.905 --> 03:17.618
This is a pretty
significant moment, so...

03:18.779 --> 03:21.951
I hope you'll understand
if my precautions

03:21.952 --> 03:24.123
lean a bit towards the severe...

03:24.124 --> 03:25.706
What precautions?

03:26.707 --> 03:28.207
Well...

03:28.208 --> 03:30.129
let's say for argument's sake,
we get into this Realm

03:30.130 --> 03:34.544
and you decide you'd rather not
lead me to the Ocean of Lights.

03:34.545 --> 03:36.507
You can be quite destructive
when you want to be.

03:39.099 --> 03:42.011
Our vitals... yours, Willa's,
and of course mine...

03:42.012 --> 03:43.433
Will be monitored at all times

03:43.434 --> 03:45.606
to ensure you don't overreact.

03:47.478 --> 03:49.148
Your brother

03:49.149 --> 03:51.851
is a very welcome
insurance policy,

03:51.852 --> 03:56.857
if God forbid something should to happen
to me once we set out on our journey.

03:58.449 --> 04:00.200
Let's get this over with.

05:40.921 --> 05:43.012
What happened?

05:43.013 --> 05:44.675
Where are we?

05:46.427 --> 05:49.058
You dropped us into the middle
of the tundra.

05:49.059 --> 05:50.731
Amazing!

05:52.352 --> 05:53.974
Where's Willa?

05:55.025 --> 05:58.317
I don't know!
The machine was programmed

05:58.318 --> 06:00.980
to send us to the furthest point
in the Realm.

06:00.981 --> 06:02.573
She should be here.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.247
I've never seen
anything like this.

06:09.039 --> 06:13.413
You sent your own daughter
into uncharted territory!

06:13.414 --> 06:15.755
You opened the door
and shoved her through

06:15.756 --> 06:17.587
with no idea
what's on the other side.

06:17.588 --> 06:21.130
You're not a scientist,
you're a sociopath!

06:21.131 --> 06:25.134
What we're doing here is greater
than me, you, or Willa.

06:25.135 --> 06:28.177
- It's progress.
- I don't care about progress!

06:28.178 --> 06:29.269
But you do care about her!

06:30.350 --> 06:32.432
And you care about your brother.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.185
Two very good reasons
to stay on task.

06:49.580 --> 06:51.121
So, let's go!

06:52.122 --> 06:53.534
You know where you're going?

07:08.098 --> 07:10.219
Ah! 'Kay,
just don't even think about it.

07:10.220 --> 07:12.300
The more you think about it,
the worse it's gonna be.

07:13.393 --> 07:14.894
Just close your eyes.

07:14.895 --> 07:17.356
Count to three.

07:17.357 --> 07:21.231
And stick the lightening rod into the
scary thing with the electricity.

07:22.653 --> 07:24.114
It's no big deal.

07:25.656 --> 07:27.027
It's no big deal.

07:28.028 --> 07:29.409
It's no big deal.

07:30.491 --> 07:31.871
Okay.

07:31.872 --> 07:33.373
It's just...

07:34.414 --> 07:37.036
Just like Benjamin Franklin.

07:37.037 --> 07:39.999
It's just gonna be a small,
small little shock.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.212
That's all it's gonna be, just a
tiny, completely unnoticeable...

07:43.213 --> 07:45.345
Son of a bitch!

07:48.138 --> 07:51.051
Oh! Um...

07:58.358 --> 08:01.150
Got a fire alarm on the second floor.
Checking it out.

08:01.151 --> 08:02.692
Uh... um...

08:02.693 --> 08:04.564
Uh... pfft.

08:04.565 --> 08:06.196
Uh... Okay.

08:07.658 --> 08:09.610
Phew! Uh! Mm!

08:18.078 --> 08:20.290
Uh...

08:21.622 --> 08:22.623
Uh...

08:28.549 --> 08:30.630
We are already up and running.

08:30.631 --> 08:32.010
It's a complete systems test.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.053
Dr. Frost wanted to personally
oversee it before you...

08:34.054 --> 08:35.183
When can I see it?

08:35.184 --> 08:37.265
Well, that's dependent
on the next several hours.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.847
No, Ms. Shoemacher,
it's Hollow Sky

08:38.849 --> 08:41.900
who is dependent on us with our
more than generous contributions.

08:41.902 --> 08:43.773
Yes, and believe me,
we're very grateful.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.404
I expect that will change
when we pull your funding.

08:45.405 --> 08:47.316
If it's results you're after,

08:47.317 --> 08:48.608
we'll have them very soon.

08:48.609 --> 08:50.489
End of business day,
or we pull the plug on Frost

08:50.490 --> 08:52.072
and sell his life's work
piece by piece.

08:56.997 --> 08:58.497
You?

08:58.498 --> 09:00.159
Hello, Luke.

09:00.160 --> 09:04.043
Just can't seem to help
running into one another.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.504
The coffee shop.

09:05.505 --> 09:07.547
Wasn't just a coincidence,
was it?

09:09.840 --> 09:11.220
Yeah, go to hell.

09:11.221 --> 09:13.472
I think you're forgetting
that you're our prisoner, Luke.

09:13.473 --> 09:15.675
Yeah? Yeah,
what are you gonna do?

09:15.676 --> 09:18.227
Stab me with your heels.

09:18.228 --> 09:19.348
Oh, no.
I don't do violence.

09:19.349 --> 09:21.180
That's what the men
with guns are for.

09:21.181 --> 09:23.312
- Kudos on the escape attempt, though.
- I...

09:23.313 --> 09:25.314
My question to you still stands.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.026
You're a smart kid.

09:27.027 --> 09:29.068
I really think
you have a lot of potential.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.401
Whatever it is you're selling,
I'm not interested.

09:32.693 --> 09:35.574
Then what are you interested in?

09:35.575 --> 09:37.407
I want you
to take me to my brother.

09:41.161 --> 09:42.292
Follow me.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.887
Hey.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.890
Why'd you tell me
those things about Ian?

10:02.312 --> 10:04.184
Wanna come in?

10:05.686 --> 10:06.937
Okay.

10:09.780 --> 10:12.572
The other night, you accused
Ian and Hollow Sk...

10:20.831 --> 10:22.122
Tom, what are you...

10:23.293 --> 10:25.165
What are you trying to prove?

10:28.548 --> 10:30.921
I'm not trying
to prove anything.

10:32.753 --> 10:35.255
I'm trying to protect you,
the boys.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.261
Have you heard from Holden?

10:42.262 --> 10:44.353
He called yesterday.

10:44.354 --> 10:47.027
He said he'd be back
later on this afternoon.

10:53.073 --> 10:54.735
I'll support you.

10:55.736 --> 10:57.197
Okay?

10:59.119 --> 11:01.620
If you think that Ian
and this Hollow Sky

11:01.621 --> 11:05.204
could be dangerous, I will
go with you to the police,

11:05.205 --> 11:07.377
stand next to you
while you tell them everything.

11:08.999 --> 11:10.751
But that's as far as we go.

11:34.654 --> 11:36.026
Incredible.

12:03.934 --> 12:05.936
What is this place?

12:07.848 --> 12:09.149
We're in a temple.

12:10.350 --> 12:11.650
They're safe havens.

12:11.651 --> 12:13.062
Ah!

12:13.063 --> 12:14.024
Willa, stop! Wait!

12:14.025 --> 12:15.065
Ah!

12:17.027 --> 12:19.239
Holden, what are you doing here?

12:20.570 --> 12:22.201
What's he doing here?

12:22.202 --> 12:24.163
You know full well
what he's capable of.

12:24.164 --> 12:26.575
Only he can
take us across the bridge

12:26.576 --> 12:27.867
and only he can bring us back.

12:27.868 --> 12:29.869
You're a snake!
I should kill you.

12:29.870 --> 12:31.210
- You can't!
- Just watch me!

12:31.211 --> 12:32.211
They have my brother!

12:33.133 --> 12:34.334
They have Luke.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.217
If anything happens to Frost...

12:38.298 --> 12:41.051
That's right.
Like it or not...

12:42.142 --> 12:43.513
we're in this together.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.606
Shall we?

13:05.325 --> 13:06.827
What are you doing to him?

13:13.333 --> 13:15.084
What the hell is that thing?

13:15.085 --> 13:17.837
Hollow Sky's
crowning achievement.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.840
A machine that induces
a coma-like state allowing...

13:20.841 --> 13:22.051
Induces?

13:22.052 --> 13:24.423
Wait, you put him
back into a coma?

13:24.424 --> 13:28.137
I know. Must be painful for you
to see him like this again.

13:28.138 --> 13:29.268
You have no idea.

13:29.269 --> 13:31.230
No. You have no idea.

13:31.231 --> 13:34.104
You don't know the first thing
about your own brother.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.146
The things he's capable of.

13:37.147 --> 13:40.359
Yeah, well, why is everyone treating him
like he's... he's some kind of "chosen one."

13:40.360 --> 13:41.781
Because he is.

13:43.203 --> 13:46.075
At least, that's what
people will believe.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.657
Oh, my god.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.159
You're all crazy!

13:50.160 --> 13:52.501
I'm not crazy.
I'm a realist.

13:52.502 --> 13:54.713
We created a product
to help the world feel better.

13:54.714 --> 13:57.006
Supply-side economics,
and we're the supplier.

13:57.007 --> 13:59.008
People will line up
all over the planet

13:59.009 --> 14:00.509
to get their taste.

14:00.510 --> 14:01.671
So that's all this is?

14:02.722 --> 14:05.514
What? You sell the world
a story and you get rich

14:05.515 --> 14:07.386
by exploiting
people's pain and loss?

14:07.387 --> 14:09.809
I may not believe in heaven...

14:11.141 --> 14:12.852
but I do believe in money.

14:21.441 --> 14:23.983
What were you thinking,
coming back here?

14:23.984 --> 14:25.365
I was thinking of you.

14:26.446 --> 14:28.118
I was trying to protect you.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.329
I thought you'd understand.

14:30.330 --> 14:33.122
Well, you're giving me
way too much credit.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.793
So it would seem.

14:34.794 --> 14:36.376
What's that supposed to mean?

14:38.048 --> 14:40.209
Well, for starters,
you destroyed the machine.

14:40.210 --> 14:43.963
Then you disappeared for days
only to wind up getting captured.

14:43.964 --> 14:45.425
I thought I could appeal to him.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.428
Why, because he's your father?

14:52.102 --> 14:53.683
When were you
gonna tell me that?

14:55.395 --> 14:56.686
I wasn't.

14:58.068 --> 15:01.481
I guess it doesn't matter now.
We're here. We need a plan.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.368
We give him what he wants.

15:09.489 --> 15:11.030
We give up?
That's your plan?

15:11.031 --> 15:12.741
No, not Frost. Arthur.

15:12.742 --> 15:14.873
From the very beginning,

15:14.874 --> 15:18.167
Arthur's been trying to prevent
humankind from reaching too far.

15:18.168 --> 15:21.040
All of the training
has been for this.

15:21.041 --> 15:23.383
To ensure life
and death remain separate.

15:24.384 --> 15:26.135
But if he crosses that bridge...

15:26.136 --> 15:27.047
He won't!

15:27.048 --> 15:28.308
And why not?

15:29.309 --> 15:31.221
Because I'm gonna destroy it.

15:39.109 --> 15:40.229
Sheriff, we know

15:40.230 --> 15:41.520
that this may be a long shot.

15:41.521 --> 15:43.192
It's more than that, Diane.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.524
We wouldn't be here
if we thought this was some

15:45.525 --> 15:47.367
harmless charity nut
paying their taxes.

15:48.408 --> 15:50.529
This is about
the safety of our family.

15:50.530 --> 15:53.122
You know the attention
Holden's been getting,

15:53.123 --> 15:55.954
and we've all been under a
microscope for the past few weeks.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.956
I know, it hasn't been easy.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.838
No, Sheriff, you don't know.

15:59.839 --> 16:03.583
And you won't until you start
taking us more seriously.

16:06.086 --> 16:07.716
Our son's friend was murdered.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.928
Now, I... I'm not saying
that this, uh...

16:09.929 --> 16:12.391
Hollow Sky was directly
responsible,

16:12.392 --> 16:14.263
but there's gotta
be a connection, right?

16:14.264 --> 16:15.974
And there...

16:15.975 --> 16:18.268
There's gotta be something
that we're not seeing.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.941
I wish I could help.

16:23.063 --> 16:26.025
But with no evidence
of intimidation, no harassment,

16:26.026 --> 16:28.527
it's gonna be tough
to build a case.

16:28.528 --> 16:30.489
We're not looking
to build a case.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.201
We're just trying
to protect our son.

16:32.202 --> 16:34.114
And why would they
be after Holden?

16:37.167 --> 16:38.618
I don't know.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.081
If you want this
to be taken seriously,

16:42.082 --> 16:44.173
you have to give us
something more

16:44.174 --> 16:47.467
than a handful of conspiracy
theories courtesy of Jeff McArdle.

16:56.226 --> 16:57.397
Pastor Ian.

16:59.229 --> 17:02.402
He and I have been spending time
together outside of church.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.646
This morning, when I asked
him about Hollow Sky,

17:07.646 --> 17:10.819
I saw something in him
I... I didn't recognize.

17:12.821 --> 17:14.992
Something that scared me.

17:14.993 --> 17:19.209
And do we have concrete evidence
of misconduct? I don't know.

17:20.420 --> 17:22.212
But I do know how I felt.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.087
I'm not making you promises.

17:29.969 --> 17:31.721
I'll see what I can do.

17:33.383 --> 17:34.594
All right.

17:41.981 --> 17:44.104
"How wonderful that we've met
with a paradox.

17:45.145 --> 17:48.317
Now we have a hope
for progress."

17:48.318 --> 17:50.518
You said that to me once,
and it's always stuck with me.

17:51.451 --> 17:52.901
Those aren't my words.

17:52.902 --> 17:54.613
They belong to Niels Bohr.

17:54.614 --> 17:56.116
I discovered that later.

17:58.198 --> 18:01.040
This machine...
is your legacy.

18:03.913 --> 18:06.256
But with all due respect,
you were wrong.

18:07.917 --> 18:11.710
Your mistake was your reliance on
others to make this machine work.

18:11.711 --> 18:13.052
But they can't do
what you can do.

18:14.053 --> 18:16.385
Not Frost, not Willa.

18:16.386 --> 18:18.097
Hell, not even Holden.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.721
Fix this.

18:22.722 --> 18:24.564
Claim your immortality.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.536
We're here.

18:37.537 --> 18:39.699
The deepest part of the realm.

18:40.910 --> 18:42.162
The Ocean of Light.

18:51.961 --> 18:54.714
The edge of human existence.

19:04.184 --> 19:05.395
Wait.

19:07.026 --> 19:08.478
Where's the bridge?

19:12.362 --> 19:13.983
There's no bridge!

19:17.737 --> 19:19.868
This can't be the place.

19:19.869 --> 19:21.410
Celeste, she was...

19:21.411 --> 19:23.623
She was on the bridge.

19:24.744 --> 19:28.086
She said she'd wait for us
on the other side.

19:28.087 --> 19:29.998
We've gotta get across.

19:29.999 --> 19:32.751
You have to get me across.

19:32.752 --> 19:34.092
Across to where?

19:34.093 --> 19:35.594
Look, there's nothing
on the other side.

19:35.595 --> 19:37.597
There is! There has to be!

19:39.098 --> 19:41.099
We just can't see it yet.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.261
You!

19:42.262 --> 19:44.224
You can reveal it to us.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.977
You were meant
to show us the way.

19:50.730 --> 19:52.190
I don't know how.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.232
Yes, you do.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.943
You know what to do.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.275
And now, I need you to do it.

19:56.276 --> 19:58.318
Your brother needs you to do it.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.492
Beyond that light...

20:03.703 --> 20:05.084
Celeste is waiting for me.

20:06.826 --> 20:08.207
She's waiting for us.

20:09.379 --> 20:11.130
Take us into the light...

20:12.131 --> 20:14.043
or your loved ones join mine
in the hereafter.

20:18.428 --> 20:19.799
You can do it.

21:13.563 --> 21:15.485
Can I help you?

21:44.844 --> 21:46.185
There's nothing you can do.

21:55.024 --> 21:56.855
Wh... what's happening to him?

21:56.856 --> 21:59.108
Oh! Hey, pull the plug!

22:00.239 --> 22:02.070
Please, help him wake up.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.153
Only Holden can do that now.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.996
It's killing him!

22:07.997 --> 22:09.579
Death is just the beginning.

23:28.698 --> 23:31.409
Holden! Holden!

23:31.410 --> 23:33.122
Are you okay?

23:39.208 --> 23:40.299
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

23:41.751 --> 23:43.301
Yeah.

23:43.302 --> 23:46.214
May God show mercy
to the righteous.

23:46.215 --> 23:48.928
Look. You did it.

24:12.992 --> 24:15.164
Who is that?

24:19.789 --> 24:21.581
He was right.

24:39.188 --> 24:40.730
I can't believe it.

24:43.943 --> 24:45.314
Mom.

24:52.662 --> 24:54.163
All this time...

24:58.998 --> 25:01.000
I knew we'd be together again.

25:24.854 --> 25:26.234
Wait!

25:26.235 --> 25:28.066
- Mom.
- Willa, don't.

25:28.067 --> 25:29.988
It's not her.

25:29.989 --> 25:31.651
It's not your mother.

25:48.758 --> 25:50.469
Why isn't he backing off?

25:51.470 --> 25:53.051
He's seeing
what he wants to see.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.883
It's blinding him to reality.

25:54.884 --> 25:56.385
Celeste.

25:57.847 --> 25:59.178
This isn't reality.

26:03.232 --> 26:04.773
No.

26:04.774 --> 26:05.985
Now what?

26:17.076 --> 26:18.958
Blow up the bridge.

26:20.159 --> 26:23.202
Do it. Do it,
it's our only hope.

26:35.134 --> 26:37.016
Holden!

26:46.816 --> 26:48.066
Don't!

26:48.067 --> 26:49.068
Hey.

26:50.439 --> 26:52.531
No!

26:54.654 --> 26:56.074
I can't.

26:56.075 --> 26:57.906
What?

26:57.907 --> 26:59.078
Why?

27:02.001 --> 27:04.914
Because...
Because I've seen this.

27:08.838 --> 27:10.800
When I blow up the bridge...

27:12.011 --> 27:13.512
you die.

27:20.930 --> 27:23.101
What do you mean?

27:23.102 --> 27:25.183
I had you in my hands...

27:25.184 --> 27:26.685
and I lost you.

27:26.686 --> 27:29.107
I thought it was a memory,
but it wasn't.

27:29.108 --> 27:30.528
It just didn't happen yet.

27:30.529 --> 27:33.032
- Holden, we're running
out of time.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.991
I watched you fall.

27:42.992 --> 27:45.123
We can't let
those things cross over.

27:45.124 --> 27:46.454
I can't lose you.

27:46.455 --> 27:48.087
This is what you meant to do.

27:50.790 --> 27:52.461
I believe in you.

28:06.065 --> 28:08.267
I'm not letting you go.

28:09.939 --> 28:11.190
I won't let go.

28:40.339 --> 28:41.680
Pull the plug!

29:05.494 --> 29:07.075
Holden?

29:07.076 --> 29:08.417
Come on, Holden, wake up.

29:09.999 --> 29:12.921
Come on.
Come on, Holden, wake up.

29:12.922 --> 29:14.462
Holden.

29:14.463 --> 29:16.045
You have to come back.

29:18.217 --> 29:20.088
Please?

29:20.089 --> 29:21.470
For me.

29:32.561 --> 29:34.023
So you have to come back.

29:35.024 --> 29:36.946
We've got so much more
ahead of us.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.220
What happened?

30:02.221 --> 30:04.632
Hey. We should
probably get out of here.

30:04.633 --> 30:05.885
Come on, let's go.

30:08.057 --> 30:10.099
Send security
down here immediately.

30:16.105 --> 30:17.196
Jeff.

30:21.150 --> 30:22.741
Nice and slow.

30:27.206 --> 30:29.117
Jeff McArdle?

30:29.118 --> 30:31.210
Tess Shoemacher.

30:34.003 --> 30:35.664
You murdered my brother.

30:39.168 --> 30:41.590
Jeff. Jeff!

30:43.132 --> 30:44.383
We gotta go.

30:55.814 --> 30:57.606
Where's your car?

30:58.978 --> 31:00.108
What, you didn't bring you car?

31:00.109 --> 31:03.191
Yeah, Matthews, the valet's
bringing it around right now.

31:03.192 --> 31:04.402
No, I didn't bring my car.

31:04.403 --> 31:06.194
You and Switchblade Sally
ditched it at the front gate.

31:06.195 --> 31:08.406
God, I love that car.

31:08.407 --> 31:10.038
So how are we
getting out of here?

31:10.039 --> 31:12.201
Don't worry, I improvised.

31:20.799 --> 31:23.591
Four suspects,
three male, one female.

31:23.592 --> 31:25.423
They're in
a black utility vehicle.

31:25.424 --> 31:28.466
Secure the perimeter, no one in
or out until they're caught.

31:28.467 --> 31:29.768
I repeat...

31:32.601 --> 31:35.183
- Are we close?
- We're closer than we were ten seconds ago.

31:35.184 --> 31:38.106
There's only two roads that will
take you off of this property.

31:38.107 --> 31:39.627
And you're sure
we're on the right one?

31:40.359 --> 31:42.191
They seem to think so.

31:45.945 --> 31:48.366
All right, hold on to something.
I'll try and take us off-road.

31:48.367 --> 31:49.527
No!

31:49.528 --> 31:50.738
Keep going.

31:50.739 --> 31:52.620
Keep going?
We're doing 60.

31:52.621 --> 31:53.661
Trust me.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.793
Didn't you get your license,
like, yesterday?

31:55.794 --> 31:57.586
Jeff!

32:35.204 --> 32:36.455
Oh!

32:52.221 --> 32:54.053
Guess that really is lucky.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.686
That compass didn't save us.

32:58.687 --> 32:59.898
It belonged to your mother.

33:02.861 --> 33:04.653
Frost told me before we went in.

33:06.235 --> 33:07.735
You should have it.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.528
You keep it.

33:11.870 --> 33:13.242
So I know it's always safe.

33:17.876 --> 33:20.209
I don't know
how I can go back in there.

33:21.540 --> 33:23.921
After everything
that's happened, I...

33:23.922 --> 33:25.793
dunno if I can keep
lying to them.

33:25.794 --> 33:26.795
You have to.

33:28.217 --> 33:29.628
We have to lie
to keep them safe.

33:31.050 --> 33:32.680
I know, it's hard.

33:32.681 --> 33:34.012
But it's the only way.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.188
You won't be alone.

33:42.441 --> 33:44.483
You won't ever be alone.

34:03.712 --> 34:05.214
See you soon.

34:26.275 --> 34:28.735
I owe you big.

34:28.737 --> 34:30.568
Thank you.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.031
You don't have to
thank me, Matthews.

34:34.743 --> 34:36.614
- I just do what...
- The universe tells me.

34:36.614 --> 34:37.656
I know.

34:58.137 --> 34:59.638
So...

35:01.600 --> 35:03.312
I've got some questions.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.066
I'm not sure how much
Willa's told you

35:09.067 --> 35:11.859
or what you think
you saw back there.

35:11.860 --> 35:14.152
Just know,
I'm still your brother.

35:14.153 --> 35:15.994
Still me, that hasn't changed.

35:17.035 --> 35:18.327
Are you kidding me?

35:21.079 --> 35:22.951
Everything's changed.

35:29.418 --> 35:31.800
Before we go in and pretend
like everything's normal...

35:33.091 --> 35:35.013
there is one thing I
really do need to know.

35:38.847 --> 35:40.179
Are we safe?

35:47.526 --> 35:50.148
I don't... know.

35:54.072 --> 35:55.573
But...

35:55.574 --> 35:57.826
I'm gonna do everything
I can to make sure.

35:59.578 --> 36:00.988
Me too.

36:00.989 --> 36:02.411
I swear.

36:06.785 --> 36:09.086
By the holy sacred
covenant of brotherhood.

36:09.087 --> 36:11.049
Get out of here.

36:14.253 --> 36:15.753
Oh, man.

36:15.754 --> 36:17.675
So, you know what
you're gonna say?

36:17.676 --> 36:19.557
Just like we talked about?

36:19.558 --> 36:22.680
Okay, you may be able
to flip cars in the air,

36:22.681 --> 36:25.303
but... lying to Mom and Dad?

36:25.304 --> 36:27.396
That's my superpower.

36:31.610 --> 36:33.521
Hello? We're home.

36:33.522 --> 36:35.152
- Well, it's about time.
- Where were you?

36:35.153 --> 36:37.154
I was about to send out
a search party.

36:37.155 --> 36:38.366
What the hell happened?

36:38.367 --> 36:40.948
Well, we were coming home
and the two front tires blew.

36:40.949 --> 36:43.621
The whole truck spun off
the road and into this ravine.

36:43.622 --> 36:47.204
Ravine? And I had to drive out
like, 100 miles to pick him up.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.627
Except I missed the exit.

39:06.885 --> 39:09.727
Help. Help me.

39:09.728 --> 39:11.099
Help me.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.773
Holden. Help me.

39:20.609 --> 39:22.441
Charlie Singer?

39:27.746 --> 39:29.247
You got a sec?

39:33.492 --> 39:35.123
Still rocking that jacket?

39:36.585 --> 39:39.167
All you need now is a big
yellow hat and a monkey.

39:41.550 --> 39:43.171
So, how is Anabelle?

39:44.052 --> 39:45.884
Gotta be what? Fourteen.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.676
She's fifteen.

39:48.677 --> 39:52.219
And she's an ungrateful,
hormonal brat.

39:52.220 --> 39:54.061
Fifteen's a tough age.

39:54.062 --> 39:55.894
You were no different.

39:58.106 --> 39:59.977
What do you want?

39:59.978 --> 40:02.611
Well, you ran away before I
could say a proper goodbye.

40:03.652 --> 40:05.523
Yeah, you shot at me.

40:05.524 --> 40:06.865
And?

40:11.329 --> 40:14.162
How is the boy wonder?
Is he still breathing?

40:16.374 --> 40:17.996
That's sort of why I'm here.

40:20.378 --> 40:24.171
I... want to help you.

40:24.172 --> 40:27.134
And him.

40:27.135 --> 40:30.007
Unless that's a prescription
for some groovy painkillers...

40:30.008 --> 40:31.219
Arthur's location.

40:36.515 --> 40:37.606
Hm-mm!

40:39.978 --> 40:41.980
I need something from you first.

41:18.767 --> 41:20.438
What happened?

41:21.770 --> 41:23.562
You did this.

41:25.654 --> 41:28.026
What did you think would happen
when you blew that bridge?

41:31.029 --> 41:32.991
This world was
the first to change.

41:34.322 --> 41:35.954
Yours will be the next.

41:38.617 --> 41:39.998
You have to fix this.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.460
How?
