-No, I really don't.

one question.

50:30.387 --> 50:32.679
It does not mean
that I'm doing anything.

50:32.762 --> 50:34.136

not gonna tell you

50:34.220 --> 50:35.512

young or you're...

50:35.595 --> 50:36.804
or you're not ready or...

50:36.887 --> 50:38.220
-anything like that.
-That's good. That's great.

50:38.303 --> 50:39.345
Yeah, 'cause that
would be pointless.

50:39.428 --> 50:42.136
-Mm-hmm.
-Right, but I-I will say

50:42.220 --> 50:43.428
that sex is supposed
to feel good.

50:43.512 --> 50:45.303
-Oh, my God, Mom. Mom.
-Yeah, for both of you.

50:45.387 --> 50:47.553
-Okay, okay.
-Yeah, so...

50:47.637 --> 50:49.470
-Got it.
-And if you're scared

50:49.553 --> 50:51.720
or you're feeling pressured,
it's just...

50:51.804 --> 50:53.804
-it's not gonna feel good.
-Okay. Okay.

50:53.887 --> 50:55.595
Can this be over now?
[laughs] I really don't...

50:55.679 --> 50:57.512
Uh, sure. I mean,
it's the preamble,

50:57.595 --> 51:00.011
-but, yeah, sure.
-Okay, cool. Oh, my God!

51:00.095 --> 51:01.637

51:01.720 --> 51:03.345
-Is this your dog?
-Yeah.

-Her name's Lynn. Oh!

-Oh!

51:07.762 --> 51:11.011
Hey, Maya. Nice to see you
out in the real world.

51:11.095 --> 51:12.387
You, too.

supposed to be impartial,

51:14.595 --> 51:16.178

pulling for you.

-the love of your life.

52:00.679 --> 52:02.595
-[cheering]
-[Alice] And we're back

52:02.679 --> 52:04.220
with Roxane Gay.

52:04.303 --> 52:07.011
I've always been obsessed
with your idea of bad feminism.

52:07.095 --> 52:09.720
You know, like,
I really identify with that.

52:09.804 --> 52:11.595
You know, I hear that
from women a lot,

52:11.679 --> 52:13.804
and I think it's because,
for a lot of us,

52:13.887 --> 52:16.345
we have this idea of
what a feminist is

52:16.428 --> 52:18.679
as angry and man-hating
and hairy, which...

52:18.762 --> 52:20.095
There's nothing wrong
with any of that,

52:20.178 --> 52:23.053
but, you know, there has
to be space in feminism

52:23.136 --> 52:24.762
for us to be human and flawed

52:24.845 --> 52:27.804
but also to really care about
the state of women in the world.

52:27.887 --> 52:28.804
-Yeah.
-[applause]

52:28.887 --> 52:31.178
-[whooping]
-[Roxane] Thank you.

52:32.095 --> 52:34.136
Can you be a bad queer?

52:34.220 --> 52:35.387
Oh, absolutely.

52:35.470 --> 52:37.095
Historically, in
the queer community,

52:37.178 --> 52:39.428
we've tried to resist
heteronormative ideas.

52:39.512 --> 52:40.929
-Mm-hmm.
-And, so, these days,

52:41.011 --> 52:42.261
to be a bad queer

52:42.345 --> 52:44.887
is probably to want
a wife and two kids

52:44.970 --> 52:46.512
and a picket fence.

52:46.595 --> 52:49.220
I think I might be a bad queer.

52:49.303 --> 52:50.762
-Oh, really? How so?
-Well,

52:50.845 --> 52:53.470
I've been in a relationship
with a really wonderful woman

52:53.553 --> 52:55.220
-for about two years.
-Mm-hmm.

52:55.303 --> 52:57.011
And we were really happy,

52:57.095 --> 53:00.387
and not too long ago,
we introduced a third person

53:00.470 --> 53:02.679
-into our couple.
-[audience murmuring]

53:02.762 --> 53:04.011
Like, a poly situation?

53:04.095 --> 53:05.470
With her ex-wife.

53:05.553 --> 53:06.679
Wow.

53:06.762 --> 53:07.970
[chuckles]
That's certainly

53:08.053 --> 53:11.053
an original way of
getting into polyamory.

53:11.136 --> 53:12.637
I wouldn't recommend it.

53:12.720 --> 53:13.804
-You think?
-[laughter]

53:13.887 --> 53:15.095
[Alice]
But that is

53:15.178 --> 53:16.553
the queerest thing
I could ever do,

53:16.637 --> 53:17.804
-right?
-Oh, absolutely.

53:17.887 --> 53:19.095
On a scale of one
to "what the fuck,"

53:19.178 --> 53:20.679
-that's way out there.
-Right? Right.

53:20.762 --> 53:23.136

I was this cool,

-Yeah, of course.

-No. Keep rolling.

54:35.804 --> 54:37.303
