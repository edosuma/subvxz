WEBVTT

00:50.550 --> 00:52.886
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

00:52.969 --> 00:55.430
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

01:02.604 --> 01:05.982
I'd like to think about it over a smoke.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.902
Will you give me some time alone?

01:27.962 --> 01:29.255
ID, please.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.551
I'm Inspector Yoon Su-hyeon from WAIS.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.471
You're clear.

01:49.526 --> 01:50.860
MINISTER CHA GYEONG-HUI

02:38.741 --> 02:40.076
Kang Yo-han?

02:44.706 --> 02:46.040
Step back.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.092
You. Get up, now.

03:15.653 --> 03:16.905
Su-hyeon…

03:22.201 --> 03:23.870
Ga-on, what are you doing?

03:25.705 --> 03:26.623
Why are you here?

03:26.706 --> 03:28.958
-Su-hyeon.
-Tell me. Why are you here?

03:30.877 --> 03:31.961
It was a suicide.

03:34.005 --> 03:37.383
We only discovered her after we came here
to inquire into her crime.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.344
Are you going to arrest us?

03:47.268 --> 03:48.478
Yoon Su-hyeon.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.625
-Su-hyeon…
-Go.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.001
-Su-hyeon.
-Leave.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.255
We need to go.

04:25.765 --> 04:26.975
This is Yoon Su-hyeon.

04:27.850 --> 04:30.478
Minister Cha took her own life
in her office.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.690
I'll preserve the scene.
Send backup immediately.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.237
MINISTER CHA GYEONG-HUI

05:30.079 --> 05:32.373
Hold on. What did you say?

05:32.957 --> 05:34.584
Cha Gyeong-hui is dead?

05:37.211 --> 05:39.797
There is a file I'd been working on.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.175
I'll hand it over to Kang Yo-han.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.555
Send someone to her office right away.

05:47.638 --> 05:50.308
I'm sure she kept it near her.

05:50.391 --> 05:53.227
Find it at all cost, got it?

07:11.180 --> 07:14.851
<i>Cha Gyeong-hui, Minister of Justice,
was discovered dead in her office</i>

07:14.934 --> 07:17.270
<i>minutes before a warrant
for her arrest was issued.</i>

07:17.353 --> 07:20.690
<i>A WAIS detective who had come
to inquire into her crime was the first</i>

07:20.773 --> 07:22.233
<i>to discover the scene.</i>

07:23.025 --> 07:25.945
<i>There are no criminal suspicions
over the late Minister's death,</i>

07:26.028 --> 07:28.406
<i>with clear evidence of a suicide.</i>

07:29.115 --> 07:31.659
<i>The police are currently investigating
the exact motive…</i>

07:35.997 --> 07:37.290
Now are you relieved?

07:37.373 --> 07:38.708
Kim Ga-on.

07:42.587 --> 07:43.796
I'm sorry.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.257
I know you're not to blame, sir.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.344
I know it's hard,
but what happened has happened.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.723
Just forget about it.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.559
Forget about it?

07:56.642 --> 07:58.227
Yes, forget about it.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.027
And focus on the next step.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.946
We have failed this time.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.908
Cha Gyeong-hui's files

08:13.868 --> 08:15.870
would have ended up
in Heo Joong-se's hands.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.011
Why did Minister Cha

08:32.094 --> 08:35.181
enjoy smoking so much
when cigars are no good for your health?

08:43.814 --> 08:46.526
What a pitiful death.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.046
Su-hyeon.

09:15.888 --> 09:16.973
Su-hyeon…

09:20.184 --> 09:21.227
Su-hyeon!

09:21.936 --> 09:23.271
Su-hyeon, please.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.606
Su-hyeon…

09:32.989 --> 09:35.283
Do you know what I did because of you?

09:36.701 --> 09:38.578
I destroyed evidence. Me!

09:40.454 --> 09:44.792
How could you…
How could you let me see that?

09:46.752 --> 09:47.837
I'm sorry, Su-hyeon.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.506
I really am.

09:54.468 --> 09:58.764
What are you and Kang Yo-han up to?

10:06.897 --> 10:08.024
I…

10:10.943 --> 10:12.236
I never…

10:13.404 --> 10:15.531
want to see you again, Ga-on.

10:37.511 --> 10:40.056
JUNG SEON-A

10:41.849 --> 10:43.476
<i>Congratulations, Young Master.</i>

10:43.559 --> 10:45.728
Cha Gyeong-hui has been eliminated
as you wished.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.565
Yes, good work. I owe it all to you.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.152
Wow, did I just hear you thank me?

10:53.903 --> 10:55.404
<i>But we're only just getting started.</i>

10:55.488 --> 10:57.740
<i>Now that our candidate
for presidency is gone,</i>

10:57.823 --> 11:00.242
the old weasels at the Foundation
will look for an alternative.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.952
So leave it to me.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.622
<i>"Since it's come to this,
let's push for Kang Yo-han."</i>

11:04.705 --> 11:07.333
I'll set it all up.

11:08.584 --> 11:09.669
Sure.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.420
<i>But since it's come to this,</i>

11:11.504 --> 11:13.964
how about just make me
the chairman of the Foundation?

11:14.048 --> 11:16.300
<i>I'd like to participate in
the Dream Base project.</i>

11:16.384 --> 11:19.095
You greedy man.

11:19.178 --> 11:22.681
Don't rush yourself.
One step at a time, all right?

11:34.443 --> 11:35.820
Yes, Judge Kang.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.613
-<i>Find Kim Ga-on.</i>
-Pardon?

11:38.280 --> 11:39.949
<i>He's probably not himself right now.</i>

11:41.367 --> 11:42.868
Find him and bring him to me.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.122
Before he does something foolish.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.373
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

12:07.184 --> 12:08.519
You're off late today.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.151
What brings you here?

12:15.234 --> 12:17.653
As far as I know,
Cha Gyeong-hui's case has been settled.

12:17.736 --> 12:20.406
Immaculately by your hands,
Inspector Yoon Su-hyeon.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.517
Stop this right now.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.187
If you don't, I'll arrest you.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.521
With my own hands.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.441
Whatever.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.829
Please leave Ga-on alone.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.166
Please.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.419
Please don't ruin him. Please.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.255
Hands off.

13:21.425 --> 13:22.885
I said hands off.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.974
Thank you.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.646
Look over there.
Isn't it that young judge who was on TV?

14:15.729 --> 14:18.524
Gosh, you look even more
dashing in real life.

14:18.607 --> 14:21.527
-May we get a picture with you?
-I'm sorry, please sit back down.

14:21.610 --> 14:22.736
Oh, come on. Just one.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.697
We really enjoy your show.

14:24.780 --> 14:25.948
Come on, we're your fans.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.408
One, two…

14:27.491 --> 14:29.159
-Please!
-Judge Kim.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.289
Looks like you had too much to drink.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.440
Did Judge Kang order you to come find me?

15:00.107 --> 15:01.650
In case I cause trouble?

15:03.235 --> 15:05.154
I'm sorry if it offends you.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.705
So Cha Gyeong-hui paid for
her sins in the end.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.790
With her own hands.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.878
Well, I feel nothing.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.174
I lived my entire life for revenge,

15:27.051 --> 15:29.094
and now that it's been realized,
I feel empty.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.475
Judge Kim.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.435
Yes?

15:37.061 --> 15:38.979
Don't get too deeply involved.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.523
What do you mean?

15:41.607 --> 15:43.734
I have nothing to lose,

15:44.568 --> 15:46.445
but you're different, aren't you?

15:51.241 --> 15:52.910
Stay with Judge Kang,

15:53.869 --> 15:55.829
and you'll lose everything in the end.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.375
Including yourself.

16:23.565 --> 16:24.858
You're here.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.278
Yes.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.448
I heard you went to see Yoon Su-hyeon.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.286
With all the eyes watching us,
how could you go see her?

16:37.204 --> 16:39.123
-Are you out of your mind?
-Why?

16:39.707 --> 16:42.126
Are you afraid in case

16:42.918 --> 16:44.920
I whistle-blowed on your plans,
Judge Kang?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.339
You think this battle is a joke, do you?

16:49.717 --> 16:51.885
Even if we risk our everything,
it's do or die.

16:53.137 --> 16:56.765
How long must I play along
to your child's play?

16:57.766 --> 16:59.476
I risked my everything too.

17:00.477 --> 17:03.230
Do you even know what I'm suppressing

17:03.981 --> 17:05.482
when I'm helping you, Judge Kang?

17:07.109 --> 17:09.028
There's a dead person
right before my eyes,

17:09.111 --> 17:10.446
but the first thing
that came to my mind was…

17:10.529 --> 17:12.948
First we…

17:13.032 --> 17:14.241
We need to find that file.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.248
What kind of a monster am I becoming?

17:27.796 --> 17:29.840
I know it's hard, but it can't be helped.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.804
You know what kind of bastards
we're up against.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.307
And they're probably now
in high spirits too.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.434
Who knows what they will do next?

17:49.151 --> 17:50.694
Your childhood friend…

17:52.529 --> 17:53.906
came to see me today.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.077
She said she'll arrest me if I don't stop.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.250
If you want to save the world,

18:05.876 --> 18:09.463
cut off Yoon Su-hyeon from your life.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.511
You can't choose to be with her

18:15.594 --> 18:17.471
if you're going to help me.

18:34.655 --> 18:35.739
Su-hyeon…

18:39.201 --> 18:40.577
is my world.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.127
Hey.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.715
Did you have a fight with Yo-han?

19:36.216 --> 19:37.467
It's not like that.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.595
Then why are you leaving?

19:39.678 --> 19:41.763
I can't board here forever.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.600
I have my own place too.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.977
Still, this is all too sudden.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.398
It's not like I care,

19:51.481 --> 19:53.317
but someone might want to get revenge.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.694
Like one of Jukchang's guys, for example.

19:57.112 --> 19:59.448
You'll find this place to be pretty safe

19:59.531 --> 20:01.617
because Yo-han bolstered security
so it's like a fortress,

20:01.700 --> 20:03.619
probably because he feels guilty.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.997
There are surveillance cameras,
security alarms…

20:07.080 --> 20:08.332
Elijah.

20:17.758 --> 20:18.926
I'm sorry

20:20.594 --> 20:22.888
for not being able to
be with you till the end.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.102
I really am.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.731
So you're really leaving?

20:37.861 --> 20:40.864
How about you come visit me sometimes?
I'll cook you something delicious.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.659
How can I go in this state?

21:34.501 --> 21:36.753
<i>Though I don't believe in God,</i>

21:37.379 --> 21:41.508
<i>I prayed to
whoever may be out there that night.</i>

21:59.443 --> 22:02.654
If it gets too tough,
make sure to tell me.

22:04.698 --> 22:05.907
Thanks.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.998
Did you have a nightmare?

22:15.125 --> 22:16.460
Are you all right?

22:36.104 --> 22:39.399
<i>That a peaceful rest free of nightmares</i>

22:41.610 --> 22:43.070
<i>and tears</i>

22:43.153 --> 22:45.906
<i>may be granted to those in this house.</i>

22:48.408 --> 22:49.701
<i>Why did you throw him out?</i>

22:50.911 --> 22:53.121
He left on his own accord.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.206
It was his choice.

22:54.289 --> 22:56.333
But this house is safer and much better.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.835
Why did you make him leave after
making him do all those dangerous things?

22:58.919 --> 23:01.546
Since when did you worry
so much about others?

23:01.630 --> 23:04.341
You could have tried
holding him back at least once!

23:05.550 --> 23:07.135
He's not your father.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.180
-What?
-You heard me.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.973
He's not your father.

23:14.017 --> 23:17.020
You'll end up hurt
if you continue to delude yourself.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.177
Elijah.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.888
I apologize. I shouldn't have said that.

23:54.516 --> 23:55.892
Shut up!

23:55.976 --> 23:57.102
Elijah.

23:57.185 --> 23:58.728
What's gotten into you anyway?

23:59.563 --> 24:01.565
The Yo-han I know never apologizes.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.195
Elijah.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.824
Just be your normal self.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.035
Now will you get lost?

25:49.714 --> 25:54.469
Here's to wishing that
our late Minister Cha may rest in peace.

25:54.552 --> 25:57.138
So, you think we should burn some incense?

25:58.765 --> 26:02.269
Anyway, we owe it all to you,
Chairwoman Jung.

26:02.352 --> 26:05.605
Honestly, Cha Gyeong-hui
was just running wild

26:05.689 --> 26:07.232
like a mad horse.

26:07.315 --> 26:10.318
She'd given me such a headache!

26:10.402 --> 26:12.279
I was only doing my work.

26:12.362 --> 26:15.031
How could I ignore a threat
to the Foundation?

26:15.115 --> 26:18.201
Every time she glared at me
with her laser eyes,

26:18.285 --> 26:20.203
I'd get heartburns.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.955
I would have died if she hadn't!

26:22.747 --> 26:25.208
Now you can have
a good night's sleep, President Park.

26:25.292 --> 26:29.212
Sure, money is nice and so is power.
But human needs to live like a human.

26:29.796 --> 26:33.091
Holding your weakness against you
and blackmailing…

26:33.174 --> 26:35.427
No wonder the end wasn't so good for her.

26:35.510 --> 26:40.140
Just how many weaknesses did you have
to shake like a jelly, President Park?

26:42.934 --> 26:44.311
Speak for yourself.

26:44.394 --> 26:48.023
Don't you think I know you're trying
to acquire Dominican citizenship?

26:48.106 --> 26:51.067
Sure, lucky you for already having one.

26:51.151 --> 26:54.279
Why are you here if you're not Korean?
Go back to your country!

26:54.362 --> 26:55.905
Oh, please.

26:55.989 --> 26:57.240
Whatever.

26:57.907 --> 27:01.995
Enough of your bickering
because the game isn't over yet.

27:02.912 --> 27:05.582
Chairwoman Jung,
shouldn't we move onto the next step?

27:08.001 --> 27:09.294
What next step?

27:09.961 --> 27:12.714
There is still one remaining threat
against the Foundation, isn't there?

27:15.342 --> 27:16.468
Kang Yo-han!

27:18.094 --> 27:20.472
Right, we'd been raising
a tiger cub all this time.

27:25.101 --> 27:28.188
Rather than remove him,
it'll be safer to drag him in.

27:28.271 --> 27:30.940
-He's grown too big.
-But how?

27:31.983 --> 27:33.777
How will we drag him in?

27:34.361 --> 27:36.279
He's an ambitious man.

27:36.363 --> 27:39.032
In fact,
he's revealed them before, hasn't he?

27:39.115 --> 27:41.409
Does it have to be Cha Gyeong-hui?

27:42.660 --> 27:46.289
Does it really have to be Cha Gyeong-hui

27:46.373 --> 27:48.583
who guards your wealth?

27:49.459 --> 27:52.087
Cha Gyeong-hui is gone now.

27:52.837 --> 27:57.467
If we promise him
the next presidency, Kang Yo-han--

27:57.550 --> 28:00.762
Do we really need the next president?

28:02.764 --> 28:06.518
Mr. President, there are just
two years until the next…

28:06.601 --> 28:08.311
Hold on.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.564
Do we really need an election?

28:23.868 --> 28:25.662
When a nation is in crisis,

28:26.538 --> 28:28.665
democracy is a luxury.

28:29.707 --> 28:31.042
That's true, yes.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.381
What do you mean by a crisis?

28:37.257 --> 28:38.341
What is it?

28:39.300 --> 28:40.969
Is this not enough?

28:41.052 --> 28:43.388
Shall I make it a real crisis
once and for all then?

28:43.471 --> 28:45.890
Chairwoman Jung, I'm awfully disappointed.

28:45.974 --> 28:49.436
Promise him the next presidency?
That bastard Kang Yo-han?

28:53.648 --> 28:55.900
Still, Kang Yo-han is a pawn worth using,

28:55.984 --> 28:58.361
-so instead of removing him--
-So you slept with him.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.739
You so did. Didn't you?

29:04.451 --> 29:06.536
How could you be so vulgar?

29:07.537 --> 29:11.166
Why are you getting so irked up?
We were just joking.

29:11.249 --> 29:14.502
Exactly, so why did you have to
come to his defense like that?

29:18.381 --> 29:19.549
We were just joking.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.009
Chairwoman Jung.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.928
Do you know what Cha Gyeong-hui said to us

29:24.012 --> 29:26.556
when she barged into our offices
before she died?

29:28.975 --> 29:30.769
What did she say?

29:30.852 --> 29:32.312
She said if we don't help her,

29:32.395 --> 29:34.189
she'll hand all the files on

29:34.272 --> 29:36.357
what went around in the Foundation
over to that Kang Yo-han!

29:37.025 --> 29:39.986
And Kang Yo-han had demanded
the same to Cha Gyeong-hui!

29:40.069 --> 29:44.240
Kang Yo-han was trying to take us down.
All of us!

29:44.324 --> 29:46.326
Including you!

29:46.409 --> 29:49.120
He'd been using you all this time,

29:49.204 --> 29:53.166
yet you go ahead and launch
that support committee or whatever…

29:55.418 --> 29:58.338
Wake up, all right?

29:59.756 --> 30:01.216
Damn it…

30:01.299 --> 30:06.012
I mean, stop acting like a desperate wench
who's craving some asshole's attention!

30:06.513 --> 30:08.264
Get a grip on yourself!

30:09.182 --> 30:12.769
Do you think you're doing a good job
because we're always cooing over you?

30:44.592 --> 30:45.718
You're here.

30:48.388 --> 30:51.850
What's this?
It's rare for you to call me, Su-hyeon.

30:52.475 --> 30:53.601
So how have you been?

30:57.772 --> 30:59.023
What is it?

31:01.526 --> 31:02.902
Is there something going on?

31:15.123 --> 31:16.207
Yes.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.003
Did you call for me, sir?

31:23.715 --> 31:24.757
Have a seat.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.642
What could this be about?

31:37.604 --> 31:39.689
What have you been forcing Ga-on into?

31:41.024 --> 31:43.151
Do you know what that child
has been through?

31:43.234 --> 31:46.321
He had survived hell
to make it to where he is today.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.532
Every man has his hell, Justice Min.

31:49.616 --> 31:52.702
And he's not a child. Just so you know.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.289
I won't overlook this.

31:56.372 --> 31:57.874
I'll dig into this, and--

31:57.957 --> 32:02.128
If you do that,
Ga-on will also end up getting hurt.

32:02.837 --> 32:04.422
Since it's a crime.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.217
I see you haven't heard the details yet.

32:08.301 --> 32:10.553
Did you hear it from Ga-on directly?

32:15.725 --> 32:18.061
So you heard it from Yoon Su-hyeon.

32:18.144 --> 32:19.437
What did she say?

32:23.524 --> 32:26.986
She said you seem to be forcing Ga-on
into doing something dangerous,

32:27.070 --> 32:29.072
but I see now that
this is beyond dangerous.

32:30.156 --> 32:31.157
Crime?

32:31.783 --> 32:33.451
Did you just say crime?

32:34.869 --> 32:38.456
It was you, Justice Min,
who forced him into danger.

32:39.374 --> 32:40.833
You sent him to me, didn't you?

32:40.917 --> 32:42.418
How could you be so blatant?

32:42.502 --> 32:43.753
And so shameless?

32:43.836 --> 32:46.798
Do you honestly believe
what you're doing is serving justice?

32:46.881 --> 32:49.467
I never deluded myself
into thinking that I'm justice.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.178
I'd been merely making decisions.

32:52.845 --> 32:54.138
And until now,

32:56.057 --> 32:58.518
I didn't have many options.

32:58.601 --> 33:00.979
So either I chose to accept it all,

33:01.062 --> 33:03.064
or fight it all.

33:04.065 --> 33:06.025
And he too had made his own decision.

33:06.109 --> 33:10.029
So whether he chooses to continue or stop
will also be his decision.

33:11.155 --> 33:13.282
Fight it all?

33:13.366 --> 33:17.203
You must think
you're battling this monstrous world,

33:19.455 --> 33:21.666
but stare deep into the abyss

33:21.749 --> 33:24.836
and the abyss too,
will stare deep into you.

33:24.919 --> 33:26.421
You need to stop.

33:26.504 --> 33:27.755
You are…

33:28.923 --> 33:30.842
ruining this world.

33:36.389 --> 33:37.849
If I may correct you,

33:40.560 --> 33:42.937
I am the abyss.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.405
<i>Yes, Judge Kang.</i>

33:53.322 --> 33:55.283
I need you to keep an eye on Min Jeong-ho.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.453
-And…
<i>-Yes?</i>

34:04.917 --> 34:06.169
Keen an eye on Ga-on too.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.048
Yes, Judge Kang.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.482
<i>Anger. That, I understand.</i>

34:28.274 --> 34:30.193
Even if no one else in this world does,

34:31.652 --> 34:32.862
I do.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.531
I understand that feeling.

34:37.950 --> 34:41.496
I wanted you to be on my side.

34:41.579 --> 34:44.540
If I needed to, I would have gladly
gone to farther lengths,

34:44.624 --> 34:46.417
be it switching him with someone else.

34:46.501 --> 34:48.336
That's my way of doing things.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.881
And that will never change.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.022
This isn't just for revenge.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.232
Then what?

35:11.567 --> 35:15.029
I want to fight against
this distorted world.

35:34.590 --> 35:36.801
What kind of a monster am I becoming?

36:14.881 --> 36:16.257
What are you doing?

36:18.259 --> 36:19.594
Do you want some too?

36:20.803 --> 36:22.346
I have my own, thank you.

36:26.225 --> 36:27.602
What is that?

36:28.269 --> 36:30.646
It's something Master Ga-on
prepared before he left.

36:32.523 --> 36:36.569
Stir-fried pork and soybean paste soup.

36:36.652 --> 36:38.487
My goodness.

36:38.571 --> 36:40.156
Come sit down.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.825
If it looks delicious.
Join me before you go.

36:43.701 --> 36:46.120
-Pardon?
-Just kidding.

36:47.622 --> 36:51.417
You never used to make such jokes.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.377
Are you getting old too?

36:59.300 --> 37:02.678
They say absence makes
the heart grow fonder.

37:04.555 --> 37:06.849
The house feels so empty without him.

37:11.437 --> 37:14.440
You should have treated him well
while he was here.

37:42.718 --> 37:43.886
Are you sure?

37:44.845 --> 37:46.222
You'll regret it.

37:46.305 --> 37:48.849
-Don't lie.
-I'll give you one last chance.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.476
I know you're just saying that.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.188
Oh what? Not again!

37:54.272 --> 37:58.025
Were you born to be a police officer?
How come you always pick robber each time?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.735
-Hey!
-I'll kill you!

38:00.236 --> 38:01.529
Actually, make that a thug.

38:01.612 --> 38:04.448
That was a deathly blow.
You'll kill many with that.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.826
-Hey, Ga-on.
-"Hey?"

38:10.246 --> 38:11.747
-Oh, you're here.
-Hello.

38:12.665 --> 38:13.874
Fine, I'll join in too.

38:17.253 --> 38:20.381
-Elijah, you bet your pocket money.
-Gosh, I'll be rich this month.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.341
-You're both dead.
-Let's go then.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.593
Let me shuffle
because you don't know how to.

38:24.677 --> 38:27.179
All right, let's do it.

38:29.265 --> 38:31.225
Here we go…

38:44.322 --> 38:46.490
<i>I don't care if mankind goes extinct</i>

38:47.992 --> 38:49.493
<i>as long as I have you.</i>

39:46.592 --> 39:52.264
GANGSTER

40:05.653 --> 40:08.823
<i>Your call cannot be connected
at this time.</i>

40:08.906 --> 40:10.866
<i>Please try again later.</i>

42:14.949 --> 42:16.158
Granny!

42:18.410 --> 42:19.370
Granny, hello.

42:19.453 --> 42:21.247
You're back again.

42:22.206 --> 42:24.875
-Now are you happy to see me?
-Happy? Please.

42:26.293 --> 42:30.339
Why do you keep on asking about
that horrible fire that took many lives?

42:30.422 --> 42:31.465
It's gruesome.

42:32.132 --> 42:35.553
Granny, I've been tracking the people
who worked at the cathedral down

42:35.636 --> 42:39.557
but I can't seem to find any information
on Jung Joseph.

42:39.640 --> 42:42.643
I think it's his Christian name.
I can't find anything about him.

42:42.726 --> 42:45.145
Do you perhaps know his real name?

42:45.229 --> 42:47.773
Or where he's moved to?

42:47.856 --> 42:49.024
Well…

42:49.775 --> 42:50.943
Jung Joseph…

42:51.735 --> 42:53.320
Jung Joseph?

42:53.404 --> 42:56.240
JUNG JOSEPH

42:57.074 --> 43:00.286
Yes, Judge Kang.
Min Jeong-ho is up to something.

43:00.995 --> 43:04.331
<i>He's been meeting with the members
of the Opposition and journalists too.</i>

43:04.415 --> 43:06.333
All right, keep watching.

43:07.543 --> 43:09.044
If you see any worrying articles,

43:09.128 --> 43:11.547
-prepare for a rebuttal right away.
-Yes, sir.

43:11.630 --> 43:13.716
And there's also something else
that's odd.

43:13.799 --> 43:14.925
Is this about Jukchang?

43:15.801 --> 43:16.760
You knew?

43:17.678 --> 43:18.887
He fled, did he?

43:18.971 --> 43:20.889
<i>He smashed his electronic tag and fled,</i>

43:20.973 --> 43:23.976
<i>but neither the police
nor the prosecution are on it.</i>

43:25.185 --> 43:28.897
-It must be Heo Joong-se's doing.
-Does he have nothing to stop him now?

43:31.025 --> 43:32.818
He must be up to something big.

43:33.736 --> 43:34.903
Full throttle.

43:35.738 --> 43:38.157
<i>Justice Min,
don't you think this is too early?</i>

43:39.033 --> 43:40.951
We haven't secured enough evidence yet--

43:41.035 --> 43:43.954
It's too late to wait
for the right timing.

43:45.164 --> 43:48.042
Let's at least raise it as an issue
even if we should fail.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.835
We should at least make it known

43:51.128 --> 43:53.422
that there were other voices in this era.

43:54.715 --> 43:56.342
Should we not?

43:58.719 --> 44:00.387
All right, Justice Min.

44:00.471 --> 44:02.723
I'll call the journalists.

44:02.806 --> 44:03.974
<i>Judge Kang Yo-han</i>

44:04.642 --> 44:07.811
is driving this country toward
violent madness.

44:08.937 --> 44:13.776
Students are playing games where
they tie up their peers and flog them.

44:13.859 --> 44:17.488
The entire nation is engaged
in a manhunt using the Dike app

44:17.571 --> 44:19.531
to track down the offender.

44:20.407 --> 44:24.870
His trials are not grounded on definite
evidence and cautious proceedings,

44:24.953 --> 44:28.624
but on surprise revelations
and incendiary propaganda.

44:28.707 --> 44:29.750
This is…

44:31.168 --> 44:33.253
not justice.

44:33.337 --> 44:37.299
There is no easy justice in our world.

44:38.092 --> 44:41.595
As a justice of the Supreme Court,

44:42.805 --> 44:45.933
I call upon the disbandment of
the Department of Live Court Show.

44:46.934 --> 44:47.935
Kang Yo-han…

44:49.978 --> 44:51.647
must step down.

44:53.565 --> 44:56.110
Wow, talk about timing.

45:02.074 --> 45:05.035
That was fast. Give them a call.

45:05.702 --> 45:07.996
There's something else we need to do.

45:10.040 --> 45:12.126
We demand Min Jeong-ho to step down!

45:12.209 --> 45:14.586
Step down, step down!

45:14.670 --> 45:16.880
The <i>Live Court Show</i> must go on!

45:21.552 --> 45:23.804
THE <i>LIVE COURT SHOW</i> MUST GO ON

45:31.770 --> 45:34.606
<i>I think we should request the police
to escort you when you leave the office.</i>

45:35.274 --> 45:37.901
-Things aren't looking so good.
-It's all right.

45:38.861 --> 45:40.863
There is no need to go so far for me.

45:40.946 --> 45:42.448
Still…

45:48.704 --> 45:50.289
<i>Justice Min Jeong-ho.</i>

45:51.206 --> 45:52.207
Who are you?

45:52.291 --> 45:54.835
How dare you defame our Judge Kang?

45:54.918 --> 45:56.378
You have a death wish, do you?

45:56.462 --> 45:58.213
How dare you blackmail me?

45:58.297 --> 46:00.966
<i>You're not taking me seriously, are you?</i>

46:02.551 --> 46:05.888
<i>Then how about I ask your wife
and children the same question?</i>

46:06.638 --> 46:07.556
What?

46:07.639 --> 46:11.935
Your place is quite cozy, Justice.

46:12.019 --> 46:15.439
<i>Are you squeaky clean or just pretending?</i>

46:26.200 --> 46:27.993
Yes, are the police on their way yet?

46:28.827 --> 46:30.370
This is urgent!

46:36.502 --> 46:39.296
<i>This morning, Justice Min Jeong-ho
was rushed to the hospital</i>

46:39.379 --> 46:43.008
<i>after he was attacked by a man
near his residence.</i>

46:43.091 --> 46:46.345
<i>The attacker is suspected to be
one of Judge Kang Yo-han's fanatics.</i>

46:46.428 --> 46:49.973
<i>Justice Min had been
harassed with protests and blackmail</i>

46:50.057 --> 46:54.061
<i>from those who oppose his opinion
ever since his press conference yesterday.</i>

46:54.144 --> 46:59.691
This is totally unacceptable
and barbaric in our civilized society!

46:59.775 --> 47:05.155
But first, I wish Justice Min
a speedy recovery.

47:06.031 --> 47:08.825
I mean, this is just unbelievable.

47:09.409 --> 47:11.787
A fanatic of a specific judge

47:11.870 --> 47:14.331
is now exerting violence? How…

47:14.414 --> 47:16.625
How could this be?

47:16.708 --> 47:20.462
I ask the Supreme Court to
reconsider continuing to leave

47:20.546 --> 47:23.549
the Department of Live Court Show
in his care.

47:24.174 --> 47:27.844
After all… I mean, it's not like

47:27.928 --> 47:31.848
there's just one great judge
in our country, is it?

47:31.932 --> 47:36.478
Isn't it time we promote our K-judges?

47:36.562 --> 47:39.273
Well, I say it's time to!

47:59.501 --> 48:00.919
You should just lie down.

48:15.559 --> 48:18.270
Last time you left
as if you'll never see me again.

48:20.188 --> 48:21.481
You're okay, right?

48:22.316 --> 48:24.401
The doctors said
your injuries aren't critical.

48:25.485 --> 48:28.405
Who cares what happens to me?

48:28.989 --> 48:30.490
Don't say that now.

48:30.574 --> 48:33.535
But they're now tormenting my family
who's nothing but innocent.

48:35.162 --> 48:37.289
They made my family's profile
public online,

48:37.372 --> 48:40.167
and my daughter's struggling
to even go into work.

48:40.250 --> 48:41.335
Professor.

48:41.418 --> 48:44.504
I didn't know
Kang Yo-han would stoop so low.

48:45.172 --> 48:47.716
But Professor, I'm sure
this wasn't Kang Yo-han's doing.

48:47.799 --> 48:50.385
-He's not--
-How can you still take his side?

48:50.469 --> 48:54.431
I will never… forgive him.

49:33.804 --> 49:36.682
This is the guy
who's been looking into you.

49:37.432 --> 49:38.517
Is he?

49:38.600 --> 49:41.687
He's been helping Kang Yo-han
since a long time ago.

49:42.437 --> 49:44.314
He even used the WAIS chief

49:44.398 --> 49:46.692
to obtain the records
on your mother's case.

49:48.527 --> 49:50.612
Even as we speak, he's looking into you.

49:51.571 --> 49:53.490
On your father's case,

49:54.700 --> 49:56.576
and even Seo Jeong-hak's too.

49:58.870 --> 50:00.122
All right.

50:01.456 --> 50:02.708
Good work.

50:19.599 --> 50:20.934
Chairwoman Jung.

50:21.017 --> 50:23.937
Why does your voice
sound so welcoming today?

50:26.606 --> 50:29.860
Let's proceed with what you suggested.

50:29.943 --> 50:32.028
Yes, I told you!

50:32.112 --> 50:33.780
We need to just go for it.

50:33.864 --> 50:37.492
<i>And I'm expecting the Foundation
to give me a push, all right?</i>

50:37.576 --> 50:38.910
All right.

50:39.911 --> 50:43.457
Oh, and I also have a small favor to ask.

50:43.540 --> 50:47.085
<i>When Jukchang's undertaking
this assignment,</i>

50:47.753 --> 50:50.672
could I ask him to do
a little chore for me too?

50:51.757 --> 50:52.799
Jukchang?

50:53.967 --> 50:57.179
Sure, all right. Fine.

50:57.262 --> 50:58.680
Thank you.

52:04.329 --> 52:05.330
<i>Now smile.</i>

52:06.498 --> 52:09.167
You blend into this house quite well.

54:34.813 --> 54:36.106
Hello?

54:38.108 --> 54:39.985
Hello, Young Master.

54:42.862 --> 54:44.364
What makes you call me
this early in the morning?

54:46.032 --> 54:47.742
How cold.

54:47.826 --> 54:51.538
Now that Cha Gyeong-hui is gone,
you're done with me, are you?

54:53.456 --> 54:56.710
<i>No way.
We'll need to keep seeing each other.</i>

54:57.502 --> 54:58.545
"We?"

55:00.922 --> 55:03.299
Then how about we see each other now?

55:04.300 --> 55:05.468
Now?

55:06.469 --> 55:08.179
Let's go on a date.

55:08.972 --> 55:11.307
There's something
I'd very much like to show you.

55:23.278 --> 55:24.529
Yes, hello?

55:25.613 --> 55:27.073
<i>Judge Kim Ga-on?</i>

55:28.366 --> 55:29.659
Yes, this is he.

55:29.743 --> 55:32.454
<i>If you wish to save Justice Min Jeong-ho,</i>

55:32.537 --> 55:34.914
<i>come to the slums in Hyeongsan-dong.</i>

55:34.998 --> 55:36.291
Who are you?

55:38.501 --> 55:40.295
<i>Right now.</i>

55:42.756 --> 55:43.882
Hello…

55:48.678 --> 55:49.804
PROFESSOR MIN

55:54.309 --> 55:55.977
<i>The number you are trying to…</i>

56:20.585 --> 56:21.836
Stop right there, bastard!

56:44.442 --> 56:46.653
<i>My fellow Koreans, the deadly virus</i>

56:46.736 --> 56:50.240
<i>was once again discovered
in the slums of Hyeongsan-dong.</i>

56:50.323 --> 56:52.367
<i>I ask for your full cooperation</i>

56:52.450 --> 56:55.245
<i>with the quarantine authorities
for your safety, please.</i>

56:55.328 --> 56:58.456
<i>I repeat. The deadly virus
was once again discovered</i>

56:58.540 --> 57:01.793
<i>in the slums of Hyeongsan-dong.</i>

57:01.876 --> 57:03.795
<i>I ask for your full cooperation</i>

57:03.878 --> 57:07.173
<i>with the quarantine authorities
for your safety, please.</i>

57:12.971 --> 57:14.556
<i>We can overcome this.</i>

57:14.639 --> 57:18.852
<i>No matter what crisis we face,
we will prevail.</i>

57:35.785 --> 57:36.911
Professor…

58:57.450 --> 58:58.618
You're here.

59:00.411 --> 59:01.871
How romantic.

59:02.705 --> 59:04.249
For a morning date, that is.

59:06.042 --> 59:08.336
I knew you'd like it.

59:10.672 --> 59:12.465
Not bad, right?

59:20.098 --> 59:21.641
What about your necklace?

59:22.433 --> 59:24.102
You're so attentive.

59:24.852 --> 59:28.147
I put it away somewhere safe
since it's such a precious gift.

59:28.231 --> 59:30.650
What if someone were to snatch it?

59:30.733 --> 59:32.527
Would anyone dare to?

59:34.070 --> 59:35.196
Do you think so?

59:38.866 --> 59:41.995
-Are you scared of me, Young Master?
-No.

59:42.870 --> 59:44.289
Why would I be?

59:46.457 --> 59:47.667
This is nice.

59:48.418 --> 59:51.170
I love it when you're
so nice with me, Young Master.

59:57.552 --> 59:59.470
So, Young Master…

1:00:03.266 --> 1:00:04.851
Why did you do that?

1:00:04.934 --> 1:00:06.102
What?

1:00:12.734 --> 1:00:15.987
Why couldn't you be
a little nicer with me?

1:00:17.113 --> 1:00:18.406
Judge Kang!

1:00:21.534 --> 1:00:22.869
Judge Kang!

1:00:50.647 --> 1:00:51.939
What's the meaning of this?

1:00:52.607 --> 1:00:55.401
I thought we'd agreed to go
all the way to the top together.

1:00:56.736 --> 1:01:00.990
Two years. I said we just needed to
wait two more years.

1:01:01.949 --> 1:01:05.203
Then we'll be able to have
everything in this world.

1:01:05.286 --> 1:01:07.538
There's nothing that I particularly want.

1:01:09.999 --> 1:01:14.003
Oh, I see.

1:01:15.004 --> 1:01:18.466
You just wanted to ruin everything.

1:01:19.300 --> 1:01:20.343
But why?

1:01:20.885 --> 1:01:22.762
Even if you clean up the trash now,

1:01:22.845 --> 1:01:25.348
the remaining trash
will come to replace them.

1:01:26.224 --> 1:01:28.267
Being the ringleader of trash

1:01:29.602 --> 1:01:31.562
isn't really my thing.

1:01:34.649 --> 1:01:35.858
I see.

1:01:39.112 --> 1:01:40.405
That's too bad.

1:01:43.950 --> 1:01:45.076
Kill him!

1:01:46.744 --> 1:01:48.162
Judge Kang!

1:02:39.297 --> 1:02:40.381
Judge Kang…

1:02:55.438 --> 1:02:56.564
Judge Kang!

1:03:01.652 --> 1:03:02.904
No.

1:03:04.530 --> 1:03:08.034
Judge Kang, don't come here.
Judge Kang, no! Judge Kang.

1:03:09.619 --> 1:03:10.995
Judge Kang!

1:03:26.552 --> 1:03:28.888
Judge Kang, no! Judge Kang!

1:03:28.971 --> 1:03:30.681
Judge Kang, please.

1:03:30.765 --> 1:03:33.267
Please don't come here, Judge Kang!

1:03:36.103 --> 1:03:39.315
Judge Kang, please don't come here…

1:03:39.982 --> 1:03:43.528
Please don't come here, Judge Kang.
Please…

1:03:44.695 --> 1:03:45.947
Judge Kang…

1:04:06.968 --> 1:04:08.177
Professor!

1:04:10.513 --> 1:04:11.764
Professor!

1:04:14.183 --> 1:04:15.476
Professor!

1:04:24.360 --> 1:04:26.404
Don't come here, Judge Kang.

1:04:27.238 --> 1:04:28.698
No! It's dangerous.

1:04:30.783 --> 1:04:33.160
Please don't come here, Judge Kang.

1:04:36.038 --> 1:04:37.623
Don't come here!

1:04:53.973 --> 1:04:55.182
Put that down.

1:04:58.352 --> 1:04:59.896
You know,

1:05:01.105 --> 1:05:03.733
I wish you were lonely like me,

1:05:04.567 --> 1:05:05.610
Young Master.

1:05:06.611 --> 1:05:08.946
Perhaps then you'll stay by my side

1:05:10.531 --> 1:05:13.284
when you have no one left.

1:05:18.122 --> 1:05:19.415
Professor!

1:05:59.330 --> 1:06:00.623
Professor…

1:06:01.332 --> 1:06:03.542
Help us!

1:06:03.626 --> 1:06:05.628
Mister, not him! Mister!

1:06:28.359 --> 1:06:29.652
Min-su!

1:06:29.735 --> 1:06:31.696
Are you all right? Get out.

1:06:31.779 --> 1:06:34.281
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

1:06:34.365 --> 1:06:36.117
Thank you.

1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:38.160
-This way.
-Thank you.

1:06:39.245 --> 1:06:40.413
Ga-on!

1:06:41.789 --> 1:06:43.249
It's been a long time.

1:06:43.874 --> 1:06:47.044
It's me. Don't you remember me?

1:07:39.847 --> 1:07:41.098
I will…

1:07:44.351 --> 1:07:45.770
make sure you die

1:07:47.271 --> 1:07:49.148
in the most lonely, pathetic way.

1:07:51.776 --> 1:07:53.819
A death that suits you.

1:08:16.717 --> 1:08:19.136
Goodbye, Young Master.

1:08:58.801 --> 1:09:02.221
<i>Judge Oh, just get ready for it.</i>

1:09:03.222 --> 1:09:05.474
<i>We are being attacked.</i>

1:09:05.558 --> 1:09:07.643
<i>This is only the beginning, Young Master.</i>

1:09:08.227 --> 1:09:09.728
<i>Will you just sit back and watch?</i>

1:09:09.812 --> 1:09:11.564
That news? It's all fake.

1:09:11.647 --> 1:09:13.315
The Foundation manipulated it.

1:09:13.399 --> 1:09:16.861
Without their stage,
they are just an average person.

1:09:16.944 --> 1:09:18.988
Mr. Jung Joseph? Wait.

1:09:19.071 --> 1:09:20.948
<i>The government has been blinding you.</i>

1:09:21.949 --> 1:09:24.201
Stop it right now! Right now!

1:09:24.285 --> 1:09:26.203
What Kang Yo-han is really after, is…

1:09:26.287 --> 1:09:29.582
I will summon you to the <i>Live Court Show</i>
and expose all of your schemes.

1:09:31.083 --> 1:09:35.087
