02:15.426 --> 02:18.595
Tonight is going to be
the greatest night of your life.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.558
Hi.

02:28.606 --> 02:29.731
Hi, Chris.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.528
- I'm a little bit overdressed.
- No, it's just...

02:36.281 --> 02:37.698
I got to cancel.

02:40.368 --> 02:43.579
My little sister got sick
and my parents are going out tonight.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.416
Well, I could come over and help out.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.794
We could make some chicken soup or something.

02:50.962 --> 02:54.131
No, you don't want to be there.
She's contagious.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.841
I don't want you to get sick.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.930
We'll do the French restaurant thing
next week, okay?

03:02.807 --> 03:03.807
Okay.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.101
When?

03:07.562 --> 03:10.272
I don't know. Friday, Saturday.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.025
I got to get going.
My sister's waiting for me.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.654
You're upset about tonight, aren't you?

03:18.114 --> 03:19.281
No.

03:21.784 --> 03:23.368
Well, yeah, a little.

03:23.661 --> 03:24.953
But I understand.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.873
You know, Chris,

03:29.292 --> 03:32.044
girls like you come along once in a lifetime.

03:37.091 --> 03:38.091
Whoa...

03:39.552 --> 03:41.011
Contagious.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.310
- Contagious?
- Yeah, that's what he said.

03:48.686 --> 03:49.686
He's lying.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.355
Brenda!

03:51.814 --> 03:54.691
Ugh, God. I don't know why you're
making such a big deal about him.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.985
He's the best thing that's ever happened to me.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.947
He's the only thing that's ever happened to you.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.990
That's why we've got to get out.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.077
It's like a Dairy Queen.
You only get one flavor.

04:06.287 --> 04:09.122
You know, I asked you over here to cheer me up.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.582
I feel worse.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.168
Oh, Chris, I'm sorry.

04:15.171 --> 04:19.173
I'm just in a really bad mood.
My parents are driving me crazy.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.176
My stepmom is such a pain.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.929
If I don't get out of the house
I'm going to spike her Tab with Drano.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.431
Don't do that.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.353
- Chris? Hi, Brenda.
- Hi.

04:32.313 --> 04:35.482
- Hi, Mom.
- That was Mrs. Anderson.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.735
She wants to know
if you can babysit for her tonight.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.906
- No. Tell her I can't.
- Why not?

04:42.991 --> 04:46.201
- Wait, aren't we doing something?
- I have to go home.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.664
Because I want to stay home and be depressed.

04:50.748 --> 04:53.166
Sit for the Andersons.
That'll depress anyone.

04:53.751 --> 04:56.211
I'm too old to babysit.

♪ <i>Sometimes you know

05:05.388 --> 05:09.641

05:32.915 --> 05:35.834
Mom is going to kill you
for wearing skates indoors.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.420
Mom's got to catch me first.
Guess what?

05:38.463 --> 05:40.630
I don't care, winghead.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.633
Mom got Chris to babysit for me.

- Bye!

05:55.646 --> 05:56.646
Chris.

06:03.112 --> 06:05.864
Chris is coming.
Would you get out of the way?

06:05.948 --> 06:07.366
Chris is coming.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.465
Oh, no.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.094
- Hi, Chris. Come on in.
- Hi.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.640
Thanks a million for this.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.643
- I'm sorry about the short notice.
- No problem.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.144
I'm glad I could help out.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.981
Sara. Sara!

06:49.409 --> 06:52.494
- Did you take my Clearasil again?
- I ran out of brown.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.539
Great. How am I supposed
to cover up my zits?

06:56.124 --> 06:59.209
- You want some orange?
- I can't use paint.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.963
What do you think?
I figure it's my best yet.

07:03.005 --> 07:06.258
I got the sun rays and the cape
and the special helmet...

07:06.342 --> 07:09.761
Great! You wasted all my Clearasil
on another picture of Thor?

07:11.222 --> 07:14.182
- Thor's my hero.
- Thor's a homo.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.684
Is not.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.521
Yeah, he is.

07:19.730 --> 07:22.357
- Is not.
- Thor's a complete homo.

07:22.400 --> 07:30.574
Take it back, Brad.
Take back what you said about Thor.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.159
You are going to kill somebody
with these things.

07:32.201 --> 07:35.829
Take it back, Brad.
Take back what you said about Thor.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.081
No.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.252
If you don't take it back,

07:42.336 --> 07:45.088
I'll tell Chris about all those love poems
you write about her.

07:46.215 --> 07:48.717
All right, Sara. I'm sorry.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.470
- Thor's not a homo.
- Thank you.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.263
- Hi, Chris.
- Hi.

07:57.810 --> 07:58.810
Hi.

08:00.229 --> 08:03.440
Hi. You didn't just hear what my...

08:03.900 --> 08:06.067
- Oh, no.
- Cool.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.280
Boy, you look great. I mean, really.

08:11.240 --> 08:15.410
- Your hair. Your eyes.
- What about them?

08:19.457 --> 08:21.082
They're so well-placed.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.961
- Brad, relax.
- Relax...

08:27.423 --> 08:28.924
Shall I take your coat?

08:28.966 --> 08:30.091
Oh!

08:30.134 --> 08:31.843
Sorry. I'm sorry.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.888
- I didn't... Sorry.
- Thank you.

08:35.765 --> 08:40.559
Boy, this is a really cool coat.
No way is this from Sears or anything.

08:40.602 --> 08:44.272
- This is way too cool.
- It was my grandpa's.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.108
- He's got great taste.
- He's dead.

08:50.571 --> 08:55.867
Brad, stop fawning all over Chris.
Come on in the kitchen, honey.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.998
- Yeah, she did.
- We played bridge the other night.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.500
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.669
- Hi.
- Hiya, Chris.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.131
- Brad did it.
- Brad, clean it up.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.843
- Sure, Mom.
- All right, Chris.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.470
I got some notes for you.

09:15.555 --> 09:19.057
We're going to be at a reception
at the Associates Center. Here.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.477
Sara is not to wear her skates in the house.

09:22.603 --> 09:26.106
- Now, Sara, Chris is in charge, okay?
- Sure.

09:27.108 --> 09:30.485
- Can we go to Häagen-Dazs?
- Well, yes.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.821
Yes, but don't go too late, all right?

09:33.114 --> 09:37.075
Brad will stay at his friend Daryl's
tonight, so don't worry about him.

09:37.493 --> 09:40.453
This one is just getting over
a very bad cough...

09:40.538 --> 09:44.916
- It's been almost two weeks.
- So I want her to take some of this.

09:45.001 --> 09:48.670
Give her a spoonful in about an hour
and another before she goes to bed.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.965
Will you stop eating chocolate?

09:52.008 --> 09:54.050
You're going to have zits all over your face.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.095
Mom!

09:58.472 --> 09:59.681
Jesus!

10:05.771 --> 10:09.357
- You guys have a good time.
- We should be home by 1:00.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.902
- Okay.
- Take good care of my baby.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.822
I'll guard her with my life.

10:16.866 --> 10:20.035
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.375
Brad, into the kitchen and clean up that mess.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.006
That's the back door. I'll get it.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.425
Come on, Chris.
Let's go watch some TV.

10:48.022 --> 10:51.399
- Are you coming over or what?
- No, not anymore.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.693
- Chris is here, isn't she?
- No.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.363
Yes, she is.
That's why I'm sleeping here tonight.

10:56.405 --> 10:57.989
- I don't think so.
- Come on.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.284
- Did you get her clothes off yet?
- Don't be crude. Get back.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.787
You fall in love
and suddenly you're a classy guy.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.747
- I have not fallen in love.
- What's she wearing?

11:06.332 --> 11:09.209
- Clothes. Now get out.
- You got to see the new Playboy.

11:09.251 --> 11:12.003
There's this girl in it
and she looks exactly like Chris.

11:12.254 --> 11:13.963
She's got these humongous...

11:14.048 --> 11:15.674
Ugh. Oh, God.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.227
- Who was at the door?
- Stray dog.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.353
What?

11:32.108 --> 11:33.817
Are you going to go to college?

11:33.901 --> 11:34.901
Huh?

11:39.198 --> 11:40.490
Oh, great!

11:42.201 --> 11:43.702
Thanks, Mom.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.954
- You're going to college?
- No.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.373
- Thank God.
- Calm down.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.584
Maybe it's Mike.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.294
Hello?

11:53.337 --> 11:55.130
Will you accept a collect call from Brenda?

11:55.214 --> 11:56.589
Sure.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.926
Chris, it's Brenda.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.471
- Brenda...
- Chris.

12:03.597 --> 12:04.764
Brenda, what's wrong?

12:04.807 --> 12:07.892
- Oh, Chris, I'm in trouble.
- You're always in trouble.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.812
No, I'm really in trouble. I did it.

12:11.063 --> 12:14.691
- You spiked her Tab with Drano?
- No, I ran away from home.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.820
You what? Where are you?

12:19.155 --> 12:24.325
- I'm at the bus station downtown.
- Look, just don't go anywhere.

12:24.452 --> 12:28.204
I can't. I have no money.
I spent it all on the cab here.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.750
- Chris, I need help.
- I know.

12:31.834 --> 12:35.044
- You're in my house.
- If I take a cab to the Andersons',

12:35.129 --> 12:38.840
- could you pay for it?
- Oh, no, that's going to be like $40.

12:38.924 --> 12:42.552
- I don't have $40.
- Well, can you pick me up?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.430
No, I'm babysitting.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.016
I can't call anybody else.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.602
My dad doesn't know.
He'd kill me if he found out.

12:53.063 --> 12:55.356
I'm begging you. It's really scary here.

12:55.441 --> 12:59.194
I've seen three people shoot up,
a bald Chinese lady with no pants on,

12:59.236 --> 13:02.363
and there's this old guy outside
who wants his slippers.

13:03.699 --> 13:06.034
Get out of my house!

13:06.660 --> 13:08.620
You've just moved!

13:10.039 --> 13:13.958
- Please hurry up and get here.
- I've got my mom's car.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.919
I can't drive it into the city.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.673
Oh, my God. There's a man with a gun.

13:21.091 --> 13:26.095
- Get me the hell out of here.
- Look, just hang up and sit down.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.807
Don't move. I'll be there in half an hour.

13:29.391 --> 13:32.894
Please hurry. I think he's going
to kill somebody. Maybe me.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.104
Brenda?

13:37.566 --> 13:41.861
- I don't believe this. I do not.
- Who's Mike? He your boyfriend?

13:41.904 --> 13:45.240
Yes. I've got to go downtown.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.659
- Brad, will you watch Sara?
- No way.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.578
- What if the house explodes?
- The house is not going to explode.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.164
You leave him here and it will.

13:53.290 --> 13:56.584
I will be gone an hour there and back.
That's it. Okay?

13:56.752 --> 13:58.753
- You guys go steady or what?
- What?

13:58.796 --> 14:01.714
- Do you?
- Yes. Are you two listening to me?

14:01.757 --> 14:04.050
My mom is paying you good money to watch me.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.552
Brad can watch you.

14:05.761 --> 14:08.888
Why would my mom pay you
good money for Brad to watch me?

14:09.306 --> 14:10.306
Sara...

14:11.267 --> 14:13.935
- Why can't we just all go?
- Because.

14:14.019 --> 14:17.355
- Do you like him a lot?
- No. Yes.

14:17.982 --> 14:21.693
- Well, which is it?
- Yes. I like him a lot.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.113
No, Sara, your parents would die if
they found out I took you into the city.

14:25.322 --> 14:28.658
They'd die if they found out
you left me here alone with him.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.077
Well, who's going to tell them?

14:37.084 --> 14:39.752
- Anybody have to go to the bathroom?
- Nope.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.509
Come on, let's go.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.555
Now, if anybody asks, we went for ice cream.

14:50.639 --> 14:51.639
Okay.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.560
- Road trip?
- Jesus.

14:56.604 --> 15:00.189
- Where are you going?
- Downtown.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.775
The city? Hey, can I go?

15:02.985 --> 15:05.320
- No, Daryl. Go home.
- Who is this kid?

15:05.654 --> 15:08.698
- Stray dog.
- Daryl Coopersmith.

15:10.492 --> 15:13.453
- And you're Chris Parker, right?
- Daryl, go home.

15:14.830 --> 15:18.750
- You must be a great babysitter.
- What is he talking about?

15:18.876 --> 15:21.502
Mr. And Mrs. Anderson
must really trust you

15:21.545 --> 15:25.715
to take little kids into the city. Alone.

15:26.133 --> 15:29.886
- Yeah, isn't it great?
- It is so great

15:29.970 --> 15:32.972
that I'll get my mom to talk
to the Andersons about you.

15:33.015 --> 15:36.309
- Then maybe you can babysit for me.
- Stop him.

15:36.352 --> 15:39.437
And then maybe we can drive off to
New York or something just for kicks.

15:39.521 --> 15:40.939
- Chris...
- Daryl.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.609
- You think?
- What am I supposed to do?

15:44.693 --> 15:47.862
- Get in the car and run him over.
- Let him come.

15:48.197 --> 15:51.157
- Daryl!
- Sorry, can't talk. Got to run.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.827
Will you just get in the car?

15:55.829 --> 15:56.871
All right!

15:59.249 --> 16:03.336
Now, boys, I swear if you give me
any grief over the next 60 minutes,

16:03.379 --> 16:05.046
I swear to God I'll kill you.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.382
Dead. Murdered. Stabbed.

16:08.550 --> 16:12.011
- Raped?
- I am too old for this crap.

16:15.599 --> 16:18.851
♪ <i>It's 25 miles from home, girl</i> ♪

16:19.269 --> 16:22.271
My feet are hurting mighty bad

16:22.731 --> 16:24.065
Mike what?

16:25.067 --> 16:28.403
- "Mike what," what?
- What are we talking about?

16:28.529 --> 16:31.030
- What's his last name?
- Todwell.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.742
- Are you writing a book?
- Mike Todwell? Do you know him?

16:34.868 --> 16:36.285
They go out.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.579
He's got a red Camaro, right?

16:39.415 --> 16:40.415
Oh, gee, Daryl.

16:40.457 --> 16:46.254
Are you a gearhead and a sex fiend?
A lot of people have Camaros.

16:46.422 --> 16:50.425
But do a lot of people have
the license plate "SO COOL"?

16:51.844 --> 16:52.844
That's Mike.

16:53.220 --> 16:56.973
He's the guy who beat me up
for touching his car, which I didn't do.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.599
- That was him?
- That was him.

16:58.642 --> 17:00.226
- Mike wouldn't do that.
- Yes, he would.

17:00.269 --> 17:03.438
- He would not.
- He did. He kicked my ass.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.940
- Want to see the footprint?
- No.

17:07.734 --> 17:11.237
Look. That's where Thor lives.

17:12.781 --> 17:16.034
- Thor?
- All the superheroes live in the city.

17:16.452 --> 17:20.121
Spider-Man, Daredevil,
and Captain America.

17:20.289 --> 17:24.083
But Thor's the best.
He fights the forces of darkness.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.877
Forces of darkness, beware.

17:36.930 --> 17:41.684
So the babysitter goes upstairs
and the sound keeps getting louder.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.979
Scrape, scrape, scrape.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.273
The babysitter stops at the kids' room.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.192
She reaches for the doorknob.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.987
Her hand is trembling,
her heart is beating fast.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.490
Sweat pours down her face.

17:55.866 --> 17:59.368
She opens the door...
And the kids are safely in their beds.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.830
I'd like to be safely in her bed.

18:05.042 --> 18:10.088
- What are you guys doing back there?
- Uh. Nothing. Nothing at all.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.339
Nothing. Really.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.927
That was my dad's, stupid.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.721
You shouldn't have
brought it along, stupid. God!

18:18.806 --> 18:20.848
- So what happens?
- Okay.

18:20.933 --> 18:25.645
But when the babysitter looks more
closely at the kids, she sees that

18:25.687 --> 18:27.855
- they don't have any faces!
- Oh, my God!

18:27.940 --> 18:30.691
- It's just a pool of mushy goo.
- Like SpaghettiOs?

18:30.901 --> 18:33.694
- SpaghettiOs with meat.
- Yuck!

18:33.779 --> 18:36.572
The babysitter screams and turns to run,

18:36.657 --> 18:40.993
but there's this big, giant hairy guy
standing right in front of her.

18:41.036 --> 18:44.539
He raises his right arm,
but there's a big metal hook

18:44.581 --> 18:47.792
instead of a hand.
And the hook goes for her face.

18:47.876 --> 18:50.169
Scrape, scrape, scrape!

18:51.839 --> 18:53.589
- Oh, no!
- All right!

18:55.634 --> 18:57.885
- You got a flat. Pull over.
- This is great.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.554
To the right, go to the right.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.518
- Slowly. Take it easy.
- This is not funny.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.233
Hold it steady.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.238
- Go slow. Pull over.
- I'm pulling over.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.699
This is great.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.533
Uh...

20:02.618 --> 20:05.745
- Where's the spare?
- I don't know.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.206
Maybe it's on the car.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.334
You think?

20:15.005 --> 20:19.675
Okay. We are going to flag somebody
down and we'll go buy a tire.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.469
I've got my checkbook.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.555
My purse.

20:31.980 --> 20:35.191
Oh, shit. I forgot my purse.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.820
I don't have any money.

20:41.198 --> 20:44.492
- I don't have my license.
- Did you forget your purse?

20:46.662 --> 20:48.579
Yes, you little asshole.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.707
- She's great.
- Wait, I got some money.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.503
- Here.
- What, 50 cents?

20:55.545 --> 20:58.381
You don't have any money.
You're a kid, for Christ's sake.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.925
Yeah, she's right.
You're a kid, for Christ's sake.

21:01.009 --> 21:04.512
- You don't have any money.
- Why don't you take a walk over there?

21:19.444 --> 21:21.821
Everybody stay behind me.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.298
You kids having some trouble?

21:43.176 --> 21:44.343
You got a spare?

21:45.220 --> 21:47.138
- No.
- Sara!

21:49.975 --> 21:52.560
You went on the expressway without a spare?

21:59.776 --> 22:02.236
- We're history.
- Ancient history.

22:06.575 --> 22:09.910
Just relax. Stay calm. Don't panic.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.247
- What do you want?
- Just want to help you.

22:13.540 --> 22:16.792
Don't listen to him.
He just wants to scrape our faces off.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.295
What, are you scared of this?

22:22.174 --> 22:23.966
You kids must be from the suburbs.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.616
I suddenly feel like a total idiot.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.955
Just stay here, okay? I'll be right back.

22:58.627 --> 23:02.546
Listen, I'm really sorry
for freaking out back there.

23:02.631 --> 23:06.384
- I guess we just overreacted.
- That's okay. I'm used to it.

23:08.428 --> 23:13.057
Listen, I appreciate this,
but we don't have any money.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.435
I'm stuck babysitting for these kids, and...

23:17.354 --> 23:20.981
I'm not supposed to be taking them
into the city like this. I'm just not.

23:21.274 --> 23:25.361
I'll tell you what. I'll tow you
to town, to Dawson's Garage,

23:25.445 --> 23:27.988
and I'll buy you a tire. My treat, okay?

23:28.031 --> 23:29.615
Okay?

23:30.992 --> 23:32.827
Oh, no, that wouldn't be right.

23:33.036 --> 23:36.288
What would be right? Leaving you kids
alone on the expressway?

23:45.006 --> 23:46.632
No, I guess not.

23:49.636 --> 23:54.849
- My name's Chris. Chris Parker.
- Pruitt. Handsome John Pruitt.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.874
- Hey, mister?
- Yeah, Red. What?

24:21.668 --> 24:25.629
How did you, you know, lose it?

24:25.797 --> 24:28.424
- Lose what?
- Your hand.

24:28.842 --> 24:31.927
- Was it in 'Nam?
- Nah, afraid not.

24:32.220 --> 24:35.723
I was changing a tire on a big rig
and the jack gave out.

24:35.807 --> 24:39.143
Back of the truck fell on the hand
and popped it right off.

24:39.227 --> 24:43.147
- Vietnam!
- What did they do with the hand?

24:43.231 --> 24:45.900
- Did they bury it?
- No, I wouldn't let them.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.819
- I kept it.
- You kept it?

24:48.904 --> 24:51.197
Yep. I got it in the glove compartment.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.119
- Pruitt.
- Yo.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.371
- Dawson here.
- Yes.

24:59.414 --> 25:00.915
I just went by your place.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.250
- And what did you see?
- You won't like it.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.462
- What did you see?
- That car was parked in front.

25:06.796 --> 25:08.464
She's with that bastard again.

25:11.927 --> 25:12.968
Oh, my God.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.013
Oh!

25:28.026 --> 25:31.278
- Stop, Mr. Pruitt, please! Slow down.
- This is great.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.077
That's my mother's car.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.751
- Okay, look out, kids.
- Oh, God!

25:50.382 --> 25:52.007
- Is it a hand?
- No.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.259
- Oh, good.
- It's a gun.

25:53.301 --> 25:54.301
Oh, God!

26:12.696 --> 26:14.071
Can we do that again?

26:26.293 --> 26:27.501
What's going on in there?

26:32.507 --> 26:33.799
I can't believe this.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.304
I mean it. I'm going to kill him!

26:39.389 --> 26:40.556
Please don't hurt him.

26:43.893 --> 26:44.893
Everybody out.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.524
Be careful.

26:54.404 --> 26:55.404
No, please!

26:59.200 --> 27:00.576
My mom's car!

27:02.245 --> 27:05.914
- Chris, get in the car.
- Hey, kids! Get out of my car!

27:05.999 --> 27:08.125
Oh, God. Oh, no!

27:08.752 --> 27:09.918
Come on, Sara.

27:11.212 --> 27:12.296
Lock the doors.

27:22.849 --> 27:26.477
That's my car. Get out of there.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.271
Get out of my car.

27:44.412 --> 27:45.954
Oh, thanks, mister.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.748
You saved our lives.

27:49.292 --> 27:51.543
- Chris?
- Yeah?

27:52.754 --> 27:53.796
Um...

27:53.880 --> 27:56.757
He's a car thief. This is a stolen car.

27:59.594 --> 28:01.387
- No.
- Yeah.

28:01.429 --> 28:05.057
- The chick is losing it.
- I am not.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.767
You guys want some candy?

28:09.312 --> 28:12.022
Brad, no chocolate. Your acne.

28:12.649 --> 28:15.859
Sara, it is time for your cough syrup.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.612
Daryl, fasten the seatbelt.

28:19.614 --> 28:23.701
- She's definitely losing it.
- I am not losing anything.

28:23.785 --> 28:26.829
I am still in control here. Got it?

28:30.291 --> 28:34.294
Sir, would you please take us
to the next corner and drop us off?

28:36.715 --> 28:41.719
In this neighborhood?
I wouldn't even get out the car

28:41.803 --> 28:43.303
in this neighborhood.

28:43.763 --> 28:46.849
- Could you drop us off at a mall?
- A mall?

28:47.559 --> 28:49.685
Where do y'all think we are, Boise, Idaho?

28:50.979 --> 28:52.938
Man, look. I'll tell you what.

28:52.981 --> 28:55.983
Come with me. I got a little business
to take care of, all right?

28:56.025 --> 28:58.694
And then I can drop you off
at a train station or something,

28:58.778 --> 29:02.489
but hey, I ain't driving to no mall.
No way.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.076
Do you promise me you won't hurt these kids?

29:09.664 --> 29:10.664

32:28.655 --> 32:33.617
- Go and get pissed, man.
- You boosted a Caddie full of kids?

32:33.910 --> 32:36.495
They got in the car
while I was still in there, man.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.664
Was I supposed to put them out on the street?

32:38.706 --> 32:39.873
They would have been killed.

32:40.416 --> 32:45.003
They know where our operation is.
They could go to the cops.

32:45.463 --> 32:46.463
Sir.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.550
No, we wouldn't go to the cops.

32:51.594 --> 32:53.679
How am I supposed to know that?

32:58.017 --> 32:59.017
Uh...

33:01.229 --> 33:03.855
We can put it in writing. We'd all sign it.

33:03.898 --> 33:06.149
- We can take it to a notary...
- Shut up.

33:08.152 --> 33:11.196
Take the Brady Bunch upstairs.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.703
We'll take care of them after the meeting.

33:18.496 --> 33:21.248
All right, you guys go on home.
Clear out of here!

33:32.635 --> 33:36.013
Don't worry. We'll get home.
This has all just been a big mistake.

33:36.639 --> 33:40.475
- But what about Brenda?
- That was her parents' mistake.

We're really in trouble.
We're going to die here.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.119
No, we're not.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.668
Oh, no.
No, we are not climbing up there.

34:48.710 --> 34:49.960
It is much too dangerous.

34:50.295 --> 34:52.672
Look at that.
You could poke your eyes out.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.344
Yeah, well, they might poke our brains out.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.721
Dallas gets the Ferraris,

there's one Lamborghini to Phoenix,
and Cleveland needs four Porsches.

35:03.059 --> 35:05.727
- Forget that.
- But they got an order.

35:05.853 --> 35:10.232
I said forget it. I didn't like
the way they've been running things.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.485
Cleveland is dead.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.832
We can go to that window.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.378
- You got to be shitting me.
- Watch your mouth.

Watch my mouth?
You got to be shitting me.

36:18.384 --> 36:21.595
- What if I fall?
- I won't let you fall.

36:25.766 --> 36:29.227
- Thanks, Sara.
- Just be careful.

37:31.457 --> 37:34.125
I don't think your parents will ever
ask me to babysit again.

37:35.628 --> 37:38.505
If they do,
I'd ask them for a buck more an hour.

37:43.761 --> 37:47.347
Well, multiple murder,
or did Sara just cut off her finger?

37:47.974 --> 37:51.142
- I got the answering machine.
- They went for ice cream.

37:51.185 --> 37:55.689
- They're okay. Chris can handle it.
- Sure! Sara's probably hanging

37:55.773 --> 37:57.232
from the rafters by now.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.204
Don't look down.

38:31.559 --> 38:32.559
You idiot!

38:37.064 --> 38:38.565
Boston, two Mercedes.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.358
What about the Philadelphia order?

39:04.342 --> 39:05.842
Where's the magazine?

39:06.969 --> 39:08.386
The Playboy?

39:11.682 --> 39:16.269
I took the Playboy upstairs.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.438
- There was this article...
- Get it.

39:39.835 --> 39:42.003
Let's go. Come on. Hurry up.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.797
Sara, hold on.

39:55.976 --> 39:59.312
One BMW. Indianapolis...

39:59.522 --> 40:02.649
- Where is it?
- It's not up there.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.945
- I think the kids got it.
- So get it back from them.

40:08.364 --> 40:12.200
They're not up there either.
They got away.

40:15.371 --> 40:17.664
- Where did you get this?
- From the office.

40:17.873 --> 40:18.873
Come on!

40:20.292 --> 40:22.043
You're going to get us into so much trouble.

40:24.338 --> 40:26.506
- Hey, you kids get back here!
- Run!

40:29.510 --> 40:30.510
Get the car.

40:31.679 --> 40:33.805
Oh, come on. They're kids.

40:33.848 --> 40:36.516
What are you going to do,
run them down and kill them?

40:37.393 --> 40:38.852
Get the car.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.690
Got to get that magazine back.

40:43.732 --> 40:45.692
It has my notes for the Philadelphia order.

40:45.776 --> 40:48.194
That could put us away for 20 years.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.416
Faster.

41:08.632 --> 41:11.968
- Oh, no!
- Hey! You kids get back here.

41:12.261 --> 41:15.054
- Come on!
- In here.

42:08.984 --> 42:12.987

your little concert here.

42:13.614 --> 42:15.281

Nobody gets out of this place
without singing the blues.

42:18.953 --> 42:19.953

42:20.037 --> 42:22.956
Nobody leaves this place

42:24.625 --> 42:26.709
You want me to sing?

42:34.718 --> 42:35.760
They want me to sing.

42:36.637 --> 42:38.972
Well, do whatever they want.
Just get us out of here.

42:39.306 --> 42:40.807
I can't sing.

That's a suburb.

43:29.857 --> 43:31.357
They probably figured that out.

43:33.944 --> 43:38.197
This is Brad, Sara, and Daryl,
and we're in trouble.

43:39.033 --> 43:40.116
Ain't no doubt.

Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice

54:06.660 --> 54:09.495

54:10.163 --> 54:13.332
I was wondering if you could please wait
until we get off the train?

54:13.667 --> 54:14.833
Sit down, bitch.

54:15.335 --> 54:16.335
Bitch, sit down.

54:17.754 --> 54:20.172
Are you going to let them get away with that?

54:20.298 --> 54:23.008
- Wait a minute.
- I was kidding.

54:23.718 --> 54:26.637
That was really rude.
Take it back, apologize.

- Hey, listen to the bitch, Brad.

54:35.522 --> 54:37.523
Watch your mouth, you...

54:38.858 --> 54:40.734

Ooh!

Don't fuck with the Lords of Hell.

54:59.254 --> 55:01.380
Don't fuck with the babysitter.

55:06.803 --> 55:08.637
All right, baby, chill out. Shit.

55:11.683 --> 55:13.225
Girl's crazy.

55:20.650 --> 55:22.568
- Are you okay?
- I can't feel anything.

55:22.610 --> 55:26.071
Don't touch it! It could get infected.
You could get anything.

55:26.114 --> 55:29.825
Tetanus, lockjaw, rabies, scabies, emphysema.

55:30.076 --> 55:32.411
Well, then don't let him walk on it.
Pick him up.

55:32.620 --> 55:33.662
Oh! Ow!

55:33.747 --> 55:37.708
- What are we going to do with him?
- Guys, can't you read?

55:38.460 --> 55:40.669
Take him to the hospital.

55:49.471 --> 55:52.598
I can't feel a thing. Look out for the car.

Ow, ow!

Get the doors open, quickly.

- Can we have a doctor?

56:08.698 --> 56:10.491
- Somebody!
- Please?

56:10.575 --> 56:12.326
- Can I help you?
- We need a doctor.

56:12.410 --> 56:16.413
- My friend was wounded in a gang fight.
- Calm down. I'll tell you what to do.

56:18.208 --> 56:21.085
Wait. That's them.
Those are the kids who stole my car.

56:21.127 --> 56:23.045

It's them you want.

56:42.690 --> 56:45.692
- Those are hot dogs, right?
- Yeah. Want one?

56:45.777 --> 56:47.486
Yeah, I'd love one.

56:51.950 --> 56:53.033
That'll be two bucks.

56:54.285 --> 56:56.412
- A check?
- But it's a good check.

56:56.496 --> 56:59.748
Chris's mom wrote it to Chris
'cause Chris bought her something,

56:59.833 --> 57:03.544
then I bought Chris some press-on
nails and she wrote it over to me.

57:03.628 --> 57:06.713
So I'll write the check over to you
and take the hot dog.

57:06.798 --> 57:09.299
- You got a pen?
- Get out of here.

57:09.634 --> 57:12.970
Wait. I'm starving. You'd rather
throw it away than give it to me?

57:13.430 --> 57:17.015
- I work on a cash-only basis.
- But it's a perfectly good check.

57:17.350 --> 57:20.894
No! I'll make it very clear.
You slip me the cash

57:20.979 --> 57:23.689
- and I'll slip you the wiener.
- But I don't have any cash.

57:24.065 --> 57:26.275
Then I don't have a wiener!

57:27.026 --> 57:30.404
There you are. One stitch. All better.

57:31.197 --> 57:33.866
- One stitch?
- Yes, one stitch.

57:34.951 --> 57:36.618
My only shot at ever being in a gang fight

57:36.703 --> 57:38.370
and all I get is one stitch?

57:39.414 --> 57:41.748
Chris is going to think I'm a total failure.

57:44.127 --> 57:47.796

with the stab wounds just died.

57:49.048 --> 57:50.340
Oh, dear.

57:54.554 --> 57:57.181
Oh, Doctor. We're looking for a friend.

57:57.474 --> 58:02.144
- Your friend? Which one is he?
- He's the one with the stab wound.

58:03.897 --> 58:05.731
- Oh, dear.
- What?

58:06.232 --> 58:09.443

Okay. I won't.

She's fainted.

He's fine.

59:19.597 --> 59:21.974
Now, you children, you stay right here.

59:22.016 --> 59:24.309

Paperwork. She's going to want
to know my name and stuff.

- No, no mothers.

59:33.695 --> 59:35.654

- Where's our car?
- At Dawson's Garage.

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:09.354
- Is her car okay?
- Yeah. I paid for the window.

01:00:09.397 --> 01:00:12.733
That's my fault. But Dawson's going
to make you pay for the tire.

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:15.319
- How much?
- Fifty bucks.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:20.490

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:34.463
Hey, Pruitt, stop!
Hold it right there!

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:42.304

Lay off, he's just a kid, you big dumb bohunk.

01:08:29.145 --> 01:08:30.188
I'm driving.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:48.038
- This is really weird.
- You're weird.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:26.077
- The car is fixed.
- That's great. That's wonderful.

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:32.750
- Thank you. Really.
- No problem.

01:09:34.086 --> 01:09:36.671
Why don't you go pay for the car,
and I'll wait out here

01:09:36.755 --> 01:09:38.173
and see that you get out okay?

01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:42.135
No, that's okay. We'll be fine.

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:46.598
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:09:49.475 --> 01:09:50.518
Okay.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:53.645
Take care of yourself.

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:56.065
- See you, guys.
- Bye.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:09:58.776
Wait.

01:10:01.238 --> 01:10:04.115
How am I going to find you to pay you back?

01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:06.326
Don't worry about it.

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:10.163
Maybe I'll see you again.

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:19.130
Come on, Brad.
Seems pretty cool, right?

01:10:29.016 --> 01:10:30.350
Mr. Dawson?

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:37.065
Hello?

01:10:37.983 --> 01:10:39.150
Mr. Dawson?

01:10:42.154 --> 01:10:43.988
Is anybody here?

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:45.907
Hello?

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:51.704
Hello?

01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:55.792
Mr. Dawson?

01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:05.134
Mr. Dawson?

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:38.376
Thor!

01:11:39.878 --> 01:11:40.878
Sara...

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:44.382
O Thor, mighty God of Thunder.

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:46.801
Who is this kid?

01:11:46.885 --> 01:11:48.720
You must be Mr. Dawson, right?

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:53.599
- Secret identity.
- What do you want?

01:11:54.685 --> 01:11:57.770
Mr. Pruitt sent us. This is our car.

01:11:58.605 --> 01:12:00.315
You owe me 50 bucks.

01:12:03.944 --> 01:12:06.779
Have you been fighting the forces of darkness?

01:12:08.073 --> 01:12:11.743
- What is she talking about?
- She thinks you're somebody else.

01:12:11.785 --> 01:12:15.121
It's him, Brad. It's really him.
Look, it's Thor!

01:12:15.247 --> 01:12:17.832
- Come on, let's go.
- Don't listen to him anyway.

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:19.625
He said you were a homo.

01:12:25.132 --> 01:12:26.966
You spreading rumors about me, kid?

01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:30.553
Oh, no. No, sir.

01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:33.598
Thank you. Come on, Sara.

01:12:36.101 --> 01:12:38.728
What's this? There's $45 here.
You owe me 50.

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:42.648
- I know. That's all that we have.
- Then you don't have a car.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:46.110
You don't understand.
We have had an unbelievable night...

01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:49.072
Save it! You owe me money.

01:12:50.115 --> 01:12:53.284
Now, you give me five bucks, or you get out.

01:12:58.290 --> 01:13:00.917
I thought you always helped people in trouble.

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:07.131
Hey, kid, this is the city.

01:13:07.758 --> 01:13:09.467
I help nobody but myself.

01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:11.469
- But I thought...
- Get lost!

01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:21.229
Wait! I know why you're not acting
like yourself.

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:23.314
You don't have your special helmet.

01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:30.780
See, you're wearing the baseball hat.
You're supposed to be wearing this.

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:32.698
Take mine.

01:13:34.535 --> 01:13:35.701
Go on, take it.

01:13:43.001 --> 01:13:44.210
You're giving this to me?

01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:47.672
Well, yeah. You're my hero.

01:13:59.393 --> 01:14:00.393
Here.

01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:02.812
Here, take the car.

01:14:05.482 --> 01:14:06.816
Thanks, Thor.

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:09.444
You're welcome. Hey, kid.

01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:12.738
I got one of these at home.

01:14:15.742 --> 01:14:18.202
Could I get your address
so I could send you a check?

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:20.455
- Go!
- Come on, Chris. Get in the car.

01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:23.207
Thanks!

01:14:32.759 --> 01:14:34.886
- Daryl, what time is it?
- 11:41.

01:14:35.095 --> 01:14:38.055
Okay, we can get Brenda
and we can be home by 1:00.

01:14:38.515 --> 01:14:40.391
Man, am I up late!

01:14:42.394 --> 01:14:44.020
Good work, Joe Gipp.

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:46.731
Follow them.

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:09.420
Stop! Thief!

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:25.394
Get out of my house!

01:15:26.104 --> 01:15:28.231
Wow, look at that toy store!

01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:32.652
Chris, look at the toy store!
Look at all those toys!

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:34.028
I can see it.

01:15:44.289 --> 01:15:45.623
Oh, great.

01:15:46.833 --> 01:15:48.042
What are we looking at?

01:15:49.127 --> 01:15:50.962
Mike was supposed to take me there tonight.

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:56.300
Oh!

01:15:56.969 --> 01:15:59.303
- What?
- Looks like he went without you.

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:01.097
Check it out.

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:11.107
What's wrong?

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:14.569
Everything.

01:16:21.868 --> 01:16:24.954
- May I help you?
- We're just looking for somebody.

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:34.171
- Let's just go in and get them.
- Patience.

01:16:45.809 --> 01:16:47.768
He's with Sesame Plexor.

01:16:48.478 --> 01:16:50.396
She's such a sleaze.

01:16:51.356 --> 01:16:53.858
He dumps you for an easy chick
and you get a night of hell.

01:16:54.401 --> 01:16:55.860
Doesn't seem fair to me.

01:16:58.155 --> 01:17:00.364
Stay here and watch Sara.
I will be right back.

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:05.328
I got to see this.

01:17:16.715 --> 01:17:21.677
You know, Ses, girls like you
come along once in a lifetime.

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:25.723
Or twice in the same night.

01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:28.017
Oh, wow.

01:17:30.937 --> 01:17:32.563
How's your sister? Is she all better?

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:34.482
Well, uh...

01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:37.818
- You lied.
- No, I didn't.

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:38.944
Don't lie!

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.995
- Get a grip. Jesus!
- A grip?

01:17:48.538 --> 01:17:51.374
Do you have any idea
what I've been through tonight?

01:18:00.592 --> 01:18:01.801
I thought that...

01:18:02.427 --> 01:18:05.513
I thought that... That you loved me.

01:18:11.895 --> 01:18:13.813
Or is it all just bullshit, huh?

01:18:14.439 --> 01:18:17.983
Look, little girl,
I don't know what you thought we had,

01:18:18.068 --> 01:18:20.695
but it wasn't half as serious
as you like to think it was.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:25.449
All right. You let go of her.

01:18:26.618 --> 01:18:28.619
Picking them kind of young, aren't you?

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:32.081
This kid's got more class at 15
than you'll ever have.

01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:40.756
- You're such a loser.
- Here we go again.

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:47.888
I could only dream of having
somebody like Chris for a girlfriend.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:51.308
But you've got her.

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:55.146
- And you treat her like this?
- Don't waste your time, half-pint.

01:18:55.605 --> 01:18:57.732
Her legs are locked together at the knee.

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.112
I'd love to hit you.

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:06.240
- I'd love to pound on your face.
- Yeah? Go ahead.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:15.166
But I won't.

01:19:18.503 --> 01:19:21.088
You're so slimy, I won't sink to your level.

01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:22.465
I will.

01:19:27.053 --> 01:19:28.888
Oh, that's just great.

01:19:29.055 --> 01:19:30.222
See you around, Mike.

01:19:36.646 --> 01:19:38.731
Did you see that? That was great.

01:19:39.065 --> 01:19:42.067
- We were amazing!
- We were, weren't we?

01:19:42.903 --> 01:19:46.280
- It was so cool.
- I was so cool.

01:19:46.364 --> 01:19:49.700
- Can you believe it?
- Where is Sara?

01:20:02.255 --> 01:20:03.547
Hey, kid.

01:20:05.175 --> 01:20:06.592
Come here for a second.

01:20:09.721 --> 01:20:11.138
Get her.

01:20:19.564 --> 01:20:21.357
Mom. Dad.

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:30.950
Sara!

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:33.118
I thought she'd be here.

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:51.387
Let go!

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:57.935
Hey, kid. Hey, hold it, man.

01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:08.112
Damn.

01:21:08.738 --> 01:21:11.198
Sara!

01:21:12.659 --> 01:21:13.868
- Guys, look.
- What?

01:21:14.411 --> 01:21:16.954
It's my dad's building.
My mom and dad are there.

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.290
She's probably there. Come on!

01:21:28.758 --> 01:21:29.758
Mom?

01:21:31.094 --> 01:21:32.136
Dad?

01:21:47.527 --> 01:21:49.653
I'll take this floor and you take the one above.

01:22:31.196 --> 01:22:33.489
Hey, kid. Come on out.

01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:41.705
I just need to get something from you.

01:22:43.875 --> 01:22:45.918
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.755
Hey, come on, kid.

01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:54.134
Sara!

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:55.970
Sara?

01:22:56.513 --> 01:22:57.513
Sara!

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:03.602
Sara's in trouble.

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:08.607
Stop. Don't go out there.

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:13.153
Get back here.

01:23:17.367 --> 01:23:18.909
Hey, kid, wait!

01:23:22.914 --> 01:23:24.581
Jesus Christ.

01:23:24.916 --> 01:23:25.916
Hey!

01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:32.047
Come on back up here. Come on!

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:39.221
- Which floor?
- We'll try this one first.

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:35.652
Oh, God.
We're at my parents' party.

01:24:52.212 --> 01:24:54.922
Now, kid, stay right where you are.

01:24:55.799 --> 01:24:57.174
Don't move.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.594
- My parents.
- What are we going to do?

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:04.181
- I'm going out there to find Sara.
- You can't. They'll see you.

01:25:04.516 --> 01:25:09.061
No, they won't.
Stay right here. I'll be right back.

01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:28.247
Be right back with the coats, honey.

01:25:54.065 --> 01:25:56.066
I don't believe it.

01:25:56.401 --> 01:26:00.654
Len Lescher. Loyola Law? Class of '68?

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:05.284
- Sorry, wrong guy.
- Honey, we should be going.

01:26:05.535 --> 01:26:06.660
Nice meeting you.

01:26:06.744 --> 01:26:08.162
It's getting kind of late.

01:26:08.955 --> 01:26:11.498
- Looking for something?
- Come on, let's go.

01:26:11.749 --> 01:26:14.960
Oh, come on, honey. Just one more.

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:18.589
- My diet doesn't start till next week.
- Well, we told Chris 1:00.

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:21.008
These are so good.
Excuse me.

01:26:23.553 --> 01:26:25.637
- You tried one of these?
- What?

01:26:26.806 --> 01:26:30.142
They are so delicious.
I've got to get this recipe.

01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:35.439
Do you happen to know the name of the caterer?

01:26:36.232 --> 01:26:37.441
Caterer?

01:26:45.241 --> 01:26:48.285
We didn't mean to spring it on you like this.

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:54.041
Hello?

01:27:01.174 --> 01:27:02.299
You'll excuse me.

01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:06.929
- Oh, my God. Is he okay?
- Did you hurt yourself?

01:27:07.096 --> 01:27:08.096
Did he hit his head?

01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:10.641
Brad! Daryl!

01:27:12.352 --> 01:27:14.603
- Where's Sara?
- She's out the window.

01:27:16.481 --> 01:27:17.940
Take it easy. No rush.

01:27:18.191 --> 01:27:19.983
- What?
- She must have gone upstairs

01:27:20.026 --> 01:27:22.527
and out the window.
She's out there now.

01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:24.821
Mom? Dad?

01:27:27.450 --> 01:27:28.784
Goddamn!

01:27:45.134 --> 01:27:48.720
Sara, just hold on, okay?
Don't be scared.

01:27:49.973 --> 01:27:51.890
Daryl, Brad, loosen the rope.

01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:54.184
Come on, hurry.

01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:57.562
Let me give you a hand.

01:27:57.772 --> 01:27:59.356
Sara, grab the rope.

01:27:59.524 --> 01:28:00.649
Easy, easy.

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:05.696
That's the most exciting thing
that's happened all night.

01:28:08.366 --> 01:28:12.119
Just take it really slow.
Don't be scared of him, Sara.

01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:15.539
Okay, that's good. Don't look down.

01:28:16.749 --> 01:28:19.084
Okay, that's good.
Keep walking, that's right.

01:28:19.419 --> 01:28:20.752
Just walk right by him.

01:28:22.255 --> 01:28:23.505
Hold on.

01:28:24.382 --> 01:28:26.925
You're almost here. Hold on, Sara.

01:28:27.385 --> 01:28:28.885

- Yeah. Can we go home now?

Not yet.

Some notes and stuff.
You know, that they need.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:20.771

Let him sweat it out. Come on.
