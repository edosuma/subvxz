WEBVTT

00:02.330 --> 00:04.000
It’s still not
bloody hot enough.

00:04.370 --> 00:06.410
WOMAN: Oh, no.
I need to sneeze.

00:06.410 --> 00:08.450
Can I sneeze?
Yes, if you must,

00:08.450 --> 00:10.490
but please no other movement
for 40 minutes.

00:10.490 --> 00:13.200
Or until your paint runs.
Whichever comes first.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.660
(sneezes)

00:14.660 --> 00:16.329
(grunts)

00:16.329 --> 00:18.490
Please, resume your position.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.790
So, you’re sure this killer,

00:20.790 --> 00:23.000
this is how he got his jump
on his victim?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.950
The victim was ambushed
and strangled

00:24.950 --> 00:26.080
in the sweltering courtyard

00:26.080 --> 00:28.750
of a heavily secured
Moroccan royal palace.

00:28.750 --> 00:31.490
A motion sensor was
tripped an hour before,

00:31.490 --> 00:32.490
but the guards see nothing.

00:32.490 --> 00:33.870
They assumed it
was a false alarm.

00:33.870 --> 00:37.120
But I believe that is
when the killer entered,

00:37.120 --> 00:38.000
and something

00:38.000 --> 00:39.620
enabled him to hide
in plain sight.

00:39.620 --> 00:42.910
And remember the paint smudges
on the victim’s neck.

00:42.910 --> 00:46.500
They were the same color
as the tiles in the courtyard.

00:46.500 --> 00:47.830
Ah.
So you think

00:47.830 --> 00:49.450
that the killer...

00:49.450 --> 00:51.580
camouflaged himself
with body paint.

00:51.580 --> 00:54.490
If we can identify
which brand of paint he used,

00:54.490 --> 00:56.660
we might be able to determine
where he procured it.

00:56.660 --> 01:00.830
If we do, we’ll be one step
closer to catching the killer.

01:00.830 --> 01:03.410
Sophia, your paint’s streaking.

01:03.410 --> 01:04.489
Good.

01:04.489 --> 01:05.330
I have to pee.

01:05.330 --> 01:08.120
So that rules Sophia’s
paint out, then.

01:08.120 --> 01:11.620
If it melts here, it would have
totally melted in Morocco.

01:11.620 --> 01:13.950
That mean we’re done?

01:13.950 --> 01:16.490
(phone ringing)

01:18.490 --> 01:20.500
Hello?

01:21.580 --> 01:23.490
Now?

01:23.490 --> 01:24.620
Yeah, okay.

01:24.620 --> 01:27.490
I’ll be there shortly.

01:28.830 --> 01:31.080
Sherlock, thanks for coming in.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.370
If you don’t mind, Dr. Furing,

01:32.370 --> 01:34.540
I’d, uh, just like to jump
to the bad news.

01:34.540 --> 01:36.080
Bad news?
Yeah.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.490
Last month,
during my follow-up exam,

01:37.490 --> 01:39.580
neither you nor Dr. Hanson
seemed concerned about

01:39.580 --> 01:41.330
my post-concussion syndrome
relapsing,

01:41.330 --> 01:43.410
so if that’s changed...

01:43.410 --> 01:44.250
No, no.

01:44.250 --> 01:45.700
Your tests were great.

01:45.700 --> 01:46.660
Better than great.

01:46.660 --> 01:49.370
Your recovery
is going well.

01:49.370 --> 01:52.490
My temp didn’t tell you
why I needed to see you?

01:52.490 --> 01:53.830
No.

01:53.830 --> 01:55.080
We were robbed.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.490
The office was closed
for the last two weeks.

01:57.490 --> 01:59.200
Someone broke in
while we were away.

01:59.200 --> 02:02.410
The thief stole our
computers, exam equipment

02:02.410 --> 02:04.490
and a bunch
of our medical files.

02:04.490 --> 02:05.750
Including mine.
Whoever did it

02:05.750 --> 02:08.039
has all of your
personal information.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.080
We wanted you to know

02:09.080 --> 02:12.290
so you could take steps
to protect yourself.

02:12.290 --> 02:16.120
I appreciate the verbal warning.

02:17.490 --> 02:18.790
So...

02:18.790 --> 02:20.250
before I go,

02:20.250 --> 02:21.620
why don’t I have a look around?

02:21.620 --> 02:25.750
I mean, I’ve seen my fair share
of burglaries, so...

02:25.750 --> 02:28.500
perhaps I can be of help
with yours.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.540
WOMAN: I think you all know
what entomology means,

02:31.540 --> 02:35.490
but this is the Department
of Entomology and Nematology.

02:35.490 --> 02:37.200
Which means we also study worms.

02:37.200 --> 02:42.200
Roundworms, hookworms,
flatworms and these guys:

02:42.200 --> 02:43.080
earthworms.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.950
This is our vermicomposter,
where millions of earthworms

02:45.950 --> 02:50.040
turn organic waste into
the world’s best fertilizer.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.040
Worm poop.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.490
(quiet laughter)
The tricky part

02:52.490 --> 02:54.700
is separating the worms
from all that fertilizer.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.660
Which is why we have
this bad boy,

02:56.660 --> 02:58.910
our worm harvester.

02:58.910 --> 03:01.080
Worms and castings
go in one end.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.490
Clean worms fall
out the other.

03:02.490 --> 03:06.490
I’ll show you how it works,
but I need a volunteer.

03:06.490 --> 03:07.620
Excellent.

03:07.620 --> 03:12.290
All you have to do
is hold this bucket right here.

03:12.290 --> 03:14.490
Ready?

03:22.490 --> 03:24.950
Is that a hand?

03:25.370 --> 03:27.410
(muffled groaning and gasping)

03:29.910 --> 03:32.200
♪ ♪

03:33.790 --> 03:36.410
BELL: Best we can tell,
this is Dr. William Velnik,

03:36.410 --> 03:38.490
Senior Professor
of Invertebrate Zoology

03:38.490 --> 03:39.490
here at Millerton U.

03:39.490 --> 03:43.040
Also known in nematology circles
as "the Worm Hunter."

03:43.040 --> 03:44.580
Apparently,
he’s one of the world’s

03:44.580 --> 03:46.370
foremost experts
on the little guys.

03:46.370 --> 03:49.490
Cause of death was a single
stab wound to the throat.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.490
The puncture mark
looks like it could be

03:51.490 --> 03:52.540
from a flathead screwdriver--

03:52.540 --> 03:54.700
maybe from that
work station over there.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.490
The university’s been looking

03:56.490 --> 03:57.790
to expand this area.

03:57.790 --> 03:58.830
Good chance that saw

03:58.830 --> 04:00.200
served as the killer’s
carving station.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.790
After that, all the pieces
went into the compost bin.

04:03.790 --> 04:05.910
They’ve been there for weeks.

04:05.910 --> 04:08.120
So, are we sure
about the I.D.?

04:08.120 --> 04:10.490
Apparently, Velnik got
this bone plug earring

04:10.490 --> 04:11.750
on one of his
research trips.

04:11.750 --> 04:14.700
It’s one of a kind,
from some tribe in Botswana.

04:14.700 --> 04:18.079
There’s a picture of him
wearing it in here.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.540
The Worm Hunter
in his natural habitat.

04:20.540 --> 04:23.540
This guy spent his
life digging up worms?

04:23.540 --> 04:25.490
Guess it’s good
for your abs.

04:25.490 --> 04:26.540
According to his coworkers,

04:26.540 --> 04:28.910
he was pretty popular
with the ladies.

04:28.910 --> 04:30.540
I wonder why.

04:30.540 --> 04:31.580
So, if he was so popular,

04:31.580 --> 04:33.250
then why didn’t anyone
report him missing?

04:33.250 --> 04:35.540
Well, he was supposed to be
off the grid in the Amazon,

04:35.540 --> 04:37.490
looking for new species of
worms the last three weeks.

04:37.490 --> 04:41.120
Everyone here just thought he
was knee-deep in rain forest.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.490
Did you find his cell phone?

04:43.490 --> 04:44.490
We think the killer took it.

04:44.490 --> 04:46.870
Also pulled the hard drive
out of his computer.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.450
Gotta think he knew
the person, right?

04:49.450 --> 04:51.080
I mean, the cell phone
and the hard drive

04:51.080 --> 04:53.040
would have pointed us
in that person’s direction.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.200
Whoever they are,
they’re not just thorough.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.870
They’re three weeks ahead of us.

04:57.870 --> 04:58.950
HOLMES:As you can see,

04:58.950 --> 05:00.620
Professor Velnik worked late
into the night

05:00.620 --> 05:04.490
before his trip, and then left
distinctly un-murdered.

05:04.490 --> 05:05.660
We found that a trifle odd.

05:05.660 --> 05:08.290
Odder still-- he was wearing
different clothing

05:08.290 --> 05:10.490
than was found at the scene.

05:10.790 --> 05:12.950
It’s almost as if
this footage came

05:12.950 --> 05:14.490
from an entirely
different night.

05:14.490 --> 05:15.490
That’s why we asked you

05:15.490 --> 05:16.750
for footage
going back a few months.

05:16.750 --> 05:21.490
We wanted to know-- was this
an anomaly or a pattern?

05:21.490 --> 05:22.620
Turns out there were
dozens of times

05:22.620 --> 05:24.290
when people’s clothing
from the lab footage

05:24.290 --> 05:25.660
did not match
what they were wearing

05:25.660 --> 05:28.500
in other campus footage
from the same day.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.410
You’re kidding.

05:30.410 --> 05:31.490
One time, someone even showed up

05:31.490 --> 05:33.870
inside and outside the lab
simultaneously.

05:33.870 --> 05:35.120
HOLMES:
So, either Velnik’s lab

05:35.120 --> 05:36.490
has come unmoored
from time and space,

05:36.490 --> 05:38.490
or someone doctored
all that footage,

05:38.490 --> 05:40.870
swapping new for old
several times a month,

05:40.870 --> 05:42.330
including the night
of his murder.

05:42.330 --> 05:44.700
We think whoever did it
could be our killer.

05:44.700 --> 05:48.290
So, as head of campus security,
we were hoping

05:48.290 --> 05:49.580
that you could
help us I.D.

05:49.580 --> 05:51.490
whoever tampered
with the footage.

05:51.490 --> 05:52.830
HOLMES: Emphasis
on"werehoping."

05:52.830 --> 05:56.620
’Cause I’ve now got an idea
who did it: you.

05:56.620 --> 05:57.490
(chuckles)

05:57.490 --> 05:58.490
You’re stealing
pesticides

05:58.490 --> 05:59.500
from Professor
Velnik’s lab,

05:59.500 --> 06:02.290
and then doctoring the footage
to hide your crimes.

06:02.290 --> 06:03.700
So, why-why did you kill him?

06:03.700 --> 06:05.490
Did he catch you in the act?

06:05.490 --> 06:06.330
Whoa, hold on.

06:06.330 --> 06:08.500
Why would I want
to steal pesticides,

06:08.500 --> 06:10.410
let alone kill someone
over them?

06:10.410 --> 06:12.490
Your yellow-stained fingers
gave you away.

06:12.490 --> 06:14.080
You’ve been
handling DNP.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.040
It’s a pesticide
employed by steroid abusers

06:17.040 --> 06:20.910
as a peerless,
though often deadly, fat burner.

06:22.250 --> 06:27.370
Fine, I have been selling DNP,
but I didn’t steal it.

06:27.370 --> 06:29.330
Professor Velnik gave it to me.

06:29.330 --> 06:30.700
Why would he do that?

06:30.700 --> 06:32.490
Payment.

06:32.490 --> 06:34.040
For?

06:34.490 --> 06:36.370
Looping the security footage.

06:36.370 --> 06:38.450
He’s the one
that wanted it doctored.

06:38.450 --> 06:40.540
He used his office for
hooking up with students,

06:40.540 --> 06:43.200
faculty, research
assistants-- you name it.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.910
He knew, if the university
found out, they’d fire him.

06:45.910 --> 06:50.490
So, whenever he needed
some privacy, he’d text me,

06:50.490 --> 06:53.000
and I’d shut off the
lab’s cameras until dawn

06:53.000 --> 06:56.290
and fill in the gaps
with footage from other days.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.410
Can you prove any of this?

06:58.580 --> 07:02.700
I’ve got texts from him
going back almost a year.

07:03.290 --> 07:06.490
The last one is from the
night you say he disappeared.

07:06.490 --> 07:09.250
Maybe the person he was
meeting killed him.

07:09.250 --> 07:12.080
WATSON:
Someone with that many
lovers is bound to have

07:12.080 --> 07:13.490
a few jealous ones.

07:13.490 --> 07:15.120
I assume you didn’t mess
with any

07:15.120 --> 07:17.040
of the other cameras on campus.

07:17.790 --> 07:18.490
Good.

07:18.490 --> 07:20.120
We should check
the footage again,

07:20.120 --> 07:22.450
see who Velnik
was interacting with

07:22.450 --> 07:23.500
when he wasn’t
in his lab.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.500
One of them could turn out
to be our killer.

07:28.490 --> 07:29.490
(door opens)

07:29.690 --> 07:32.110
WATSON:
Looks like a nasty bunch.

07:32.110 --> 07:34.690
Think one of them killed Velnik?

07:34.690 --> 07:35.690
Not precisely.

07:35.690 --> 07:38.400
These are stand-ins
for the women he was diddling,

07:38.400 --> 07:40.150
any one of whom
could have murdered him.

07:40.150 --> 07:43.650
And you had to make them
into worms because...?

07:43.650 --> 07:44.690
While you got
our dinner,

07:44.690 --> 07:47.610
I went through the footage
from the other cameras

07:47.610 --> 07:48.650
at the university.

07:48.650 --> 07:51.690
I identified at least one woman

07:51.690 --> 07:55.490
who almost certainly
frequented Velnik’s bed.

07:55.490 --> 07:59.240
A T.A. named Iris Hill.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.690
I noticed that she
was wearing a pendant

08:01.690 --> 08:03.820
from the Andean
Qu’e-chi tribe.

08:03.820 --> 08:05.860
Velnik was one
of the few Westerners

08:05.860 --> 08:06.860
allowed to meet with them.

08:06.860 --> 08:09.690
So it stands to reason
he gave it to her.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.690
Then I remembered this.

08:10.690 --> 08:13.950
Velnik had a naming plaque
at his office to commemorate

08:13.950 --> 08:16.610
the many new species
that he had discovered--

08:16.610 --> 08:19.070
including this
delightful specimen.

08:19.070 --> 08:21.200
Pulchralata collis iridescens.

08:21.200 --> 08:25.690
That’s Latin
for "beautiful Iris Hill."

08:26.110 --> 08:27.740
He named an
inchworm after her?

08:27.740 --> 08:29.030
It’s not uncommon
for scientists

08:29.030 --> 08:32.240
to name species after people
they care for or admire.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.740
I named a honeybee after you.

08:33.740 --> 08:36.200
But I, of course,
was honoring my work partner.

08:36.200 --> 08:39.900
The professor, I believe,
was honoring his sex partners.

08:39.900 --> 08:43.030
So you think these are all
Latin versions of women’s names.

08:43.030 --> 08:45.200
If you’re right,
all we have to do

08:45.200 --> 08:46.690
is translate them into English,

08:46.690 --> 08:49.150
and then cross-reference them
against a list

08:49.150 --> 08:50.530
of his students
and colleagues.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.780
The university
sent over such a list

08:53.780 --> 08:55.780
a little while ago. Here.

08:55.780 --> 08:57.740
Oh, speaking of sex partners,
I ran into

08:57.740 --> 08:59.690
Athena and Sophia on their
way out this morning.

08:59.690 --> 09:01.740
They said you were going
to see Dr. Furing.

09:01.740 --> 09:02.690
Is everything okay?

09:02.690 --> 09:04.360
She wanted me to know
that her office

09:04.360 --> 09:06.360
had been burglarized
and that my patient file

09:06.360 --> 09:07.610
was among the items missing.

09:07.610 --> 09:09.400
In addition to securing
my personal information,

09:09.400 --> 09:12.110
I’ve also decided
to identify the culprit.

09:12.110 --> 09:14.690
I reached out to several
pawnshops and fences,

09:14.690 --> 09:16.400
as well as a friend
at a credit bureau

09:16.400 --> 09:18.280
who’s agreed to flag
any suspicious activity

09:18.280 --> 09:20.360
with my stolen data.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.360
In the meantime,

09:21.360 --> 09:24.610
shall we put some names
to these beautiful faces?

09:31.990 --> 09:34.570
(woman sobbing)

09:36.280 --> 09:42.150
Will told me I was
his Formosan termite.

09:42.150 --> 09:44.690
They mate for life.

09:45.450 --> 09:47.820
(sobbing)

09:52.990 --> 09:53.950
Next.

09:53.950 --> 09:56.070
HOLMES:
TyingMorpho aurora hortulana

09:56.070 --> 09:58.690
to your name,
Sepi Chamanara, wasn’t easy.

09:58.690 --> 10:02.400
Aurora means "dawn,"
but there wasn’t a single Dawn

10:02.400 --> 10:04.740
in our list of William Velnik’s
known associates.

10:04.740 --> 10:06.450
WATSON:Sepiis short for "dawn"

10:06.450 --> 10:08.700
in Farsi--
isn’t that right, Professor?

10:08.700 --> 10:10.650
Andchamanaraandhortulana

10:10.650 --> 10:11.450
both mean "gardener"

10:11.450 --> 10:14.690
in Farsi and in Latin
respectively.

10:14.690 --> 10:18.690
Hence the "Brush-Footed
Butterfly Sepi Chamanara."

10:18.690 --> 10:22.400
It’s a good indication that you
and Velnik were lovers.

10:24.530 --> 10:25.320
Okay.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.690
Yes, Will and I had sex
from time to time.

10:28.690 --> 10:30.530
But it wasn’t anything serious.

10:30.530 --> 10:32.780
When you say it wasn’t serious,
does that mean

10:32.780 --> 10:35.450
you knew he was hooking up
with other women?

10:35.450 --> 10:38.150
The way I see it,
Will and I were just animals

10:38.150 --> 10:39.900
fulfilling a biological
imperative.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.700
There was no reason to
get emotional about it.

10:42.700 --> 10:47.030
Many animals have been known
to kill their sexual rivals.

10:47.030 --> 10:48.490
Or mates.

10:48.490 --> 10:50.150
Many.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.610
But not all.

10:51.610 --> 10:54.030
Will and I were
more like...

10:54.490 --> 10:58.530
...bonobo chimps
than, say, lions.

10:58.530 --> 11:00.780
When we were together...

11:00.780 --> 11:01.950
we had fun.

11:01.950 --> 11:04.360
But when we weren’t,
we didn’t think about it.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.030
In fact, I was with
another lover

11:06.030 --> 11:07.690
the night you think Will died.

11:07.690 --> 11:09.650
I can get you her info.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.030
All right,
assuming that checks out,

11:12.030 --> 11:14.360
any idea who else
might have done this?

11:14.360 --> 11:18.450
I never kept track of who
Will was sleeping with,

11:18.450 --> 11:22.650
but there is a woman out
there, Becca Mainzer--

11:22.650 --> 11:23.950
I had her in a
seminar last quarter.

11:23.950 --> 11:27.070
I didn’t know that she and Will
were hooking up at the time,

11:27.070 --> 11:29.700
but it definitely
explains her behavior.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.690
What behavior?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.490
She’d snap at
me in class.

11:32.490 --> 11:36.570
She’d complain about grades,
deadlines.

11:36.570 --> 11:39.570
She even dinged my car once.

11:39.690 --> 11:42.150
At the time, I-I thought
it was just an accident, but...

11:42.150 --> 11:47.700
maybe underneath it all,
Becca is a lioness.

11:48.610 --> 11:49.690
I’m married.

11:49.690 --> 11:50.610
Why would I care

11:50.610 --> 11:52.360
who Professor Velnik
was sleeping with?

11:52.360 --> 11:55.400
There is a reason we saved
you for last, Becca.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.400
Three of his other lovers

11:56.400 --> 11:58.690
said they saw the two of you
kissing on campus.

11:58.690 --> 12:02.200
He even named
a velvet worm after you.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.110
Fine.

12:04.110 --> 12:06.400
Will and I were seeing
each other.

12:06.400 --> 12:09.690
And yes, I get
possessive.

12:09.690 --> 12:11.320
But I didn’t kill him.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.820
I was at home with my husband
that night.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.070
That seems unlikely,

12:15.070 --> 12:17.490
given that security feeds
show your car

12:17.490 --> 12:19.700
entering the campus lot
at 7:30 p.m.

12:19.700 --> 12:20.780
and leaving two hours later.

12:20.780 --> 12:23.150
BELL:
That puts you near
the crime scene

12:23.150 --> 12:25.820
around the time
Velnik was murdered.

12:25.820 --> 12:27.030
So tell us again:

12:27.030 --> 12:30.240
Were you home,
or were you there?

12:30.950 --> 12:33.240
I was home.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.950
Then who was driving your car?

12:37.690 --> 12:40.950
BELL:
Your wife spilled
her guts, Donnie.

12:40.950 --> 12:42.280
The affair,

12:42.280 --> 12:43.690
you taking the car.

12:43.690 --> 12:48.280
As if that weren’t enough,
a crosswalk camera clocked you

12:48.280 --> 12:52.030
just a block from Millerton
University’s bio building

12:52.030 --> 12:54.820
around the time we think
Velnik was killed.

12:54.820 --> 12:56.320
There’s no good
reason for you

12:56.320 --> 12:58.280
to be on campus
at that hour.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.240
Apart from murdering your
wife’s lover, of course.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.280
Don’t call him that.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.240
He was a predator.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.950
He stole Becca from me.

13:08.950 --> 13:10.780
He deserved what he got.

13:10.780 --> 13:14.110
So you admit to killing him?

13:14.990 --> 13:17.320
Yeah. I do.

13:17.320 --> 13:20.030
I found their e-mails
to each other.

13:20.030 --> 13:21.320
The crap he was
telling her.

13:21.320 --> 13:24.360
Promises he was never
gonna keep.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.690
The pictures.

13:28.030 --> 13:29.650
That night, I finally had it.

13:29.650 --> 13:34.490
I faked a story about having
to fix my mom’s water heater.

13:34.490 --> 13:37.280
My car was in the shop,
so I took Becca’s.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.530
Drove to the
son of a bitch’s lab

13:40.530 --> 13:42.690
and shot him
in the chest.

13:42.690 --> 13:44.700
You shot him?

13:45.530 --> 13:47.110
Three times.

13:47.110 --> 13:48.400
Right here.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.280
I tossed the gun
in the sewer,

13:50.280 --> 13:51.900
and I went home,
and I went to bed.

13:51.900 --> 13:55.200
Best night’s sleep
I had in months.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.690
We’ll be back in a minute.

14:05.530 --> 14:07.650
I’m not crazy, right?

14:07.650 --> 14:09.700
The M.E. confirmed Velnik died

14:09.700 --> 14:10.990
from a severed
carotid?

14:10.990 --> 14:11.950
You’re not crazy.

14:11.950 --> 14:12.820
There were no bullet wounds.

14:12.820 --> 14:14.610
Velnik wasn’t shot.
He was stabbed.

14:14.610 --> 14:17.740
So why confess to a murder,
and then lie about the method?

14:17.740 --> 14:19.200
I don’t think
he is lying.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.690
I think he did shoot
Professor Velnik,

14:21.690 --> 14:24.200
but someone else killed him.

14:29.010 --> 14:31.430
Hey. How’d it go with Hawes?

14:31.530 --> 14:32.900
Well, he wasn’t happy to hear

14:32.900 --> 14:34.190
that he might have
missed something,

14:34.190 --> 14:35.860
but he did agree
to reexamine Velnik’s body.

14:35.860 --> 14:38.700
Most notably the three
hairline fractures on his ribs.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.650
Given Mainzer’s confession,
we both saw the fractures

14:40.650 --> 14:43.900
in a new light,
and Eugene amended his findings

14:43.900 --> 14:45.570
to state that,
prior to his death,

14:45.570 --> 14:48.190
Velnik was shot three times
in the chest,

14:48.190 --> 14:50.190
but the bullets
were probably stopped

14:50.190 --> 14:51.900
by some sort of body armor.

14:51.900 --> 14:52.650
Was he wearing a vest?

14:52.650 --> 14:54.860
’Cause CSU didn’t find one
at the scene.

14:54.860 --> 14:57.030
Nor did campus
security footage

14:57.030 --> 14:58.150
capture one
on his person.

14:58.150 --> 15:00.190
That hoodie he’s wearing
is pretty thin.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.200
I mean, if he was
wearing a vest,

15:02.200 --> 15:04.950
we would be able to see one
underneath it.

15:04.950 --> 15:05.820
We would.

15:05.820 --> 15:08.190
So I submit
that the garment itself

15:08.190 --> 15:09.820
stopped the bullets.

15:09.820 --> 15:11.400
His hoodie?
Mainzer confirmed

15:11.400 --> 15:13.860
that when he shot Velnik,
all Velnik was wearing

15:13.860 --> 15:17.950
was-- and I quote--
"a fancy silvery sweatshirt."

15:17.950 --> 15:21.240
Okay, but CSU didn’t find
that at the scene, either.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.190
If the hoodie
is bulletproof,

15:23.190 --> 15:26.110
it was probably taken
by whoever stabbed him.

15:26.110 --> 15:28.030
Why?
Because, judging by that image,

15:28.030 --> 15:29.740
it would be the thinnest
ballistic cloth

15:29.740 --> 15:33.360
in the world, an innovation
worth potentially millions.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.860
The question
then would be--

15:35.860 --> 15:38.070
where did the professor get it?

15:38.070 --> 15:41.240
I think I might have an idea.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.950
The captain sent over
Velnik’s financials.

15:44.950 --> 15:48.280
Looks like he was
spending way more money

15:48.280 --> 15:49.530
than he made as
a professor.

15:49.530 --> 15:51.700
When he was jetting around
the world hunting worms,

15:51.700 --> 15:54.320
he stayed in high-end resorts,
ate at the best restaurants.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.320
Did you look into how
he was paying for it?

15:56.320 --> 15:58.900
He was siphoning cash
out of his research grants.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.190
I thought maybe one of the
people who was funding him

16:01.190 --> 16:02.860
found out and then
put a stop to it.

16:02.860 --> 16:08.190
But take a look
at his biggest patron.

16:09.190 --> 16:12.150
Hoyt Armor Solutions.

16:12.150 --> 16:13.610
They gave him $200,000

16:13.610 --> 16:15.780
for an unspecified
research project.

16:15.780 --> 16:17.190
Can’t be a coincidence
that he was

16:17.190 --> 16:19.650
wearing that hoodie
while working for them,

16:19.650 --> 16:21.150
can it?
No.

16:21.150 --> 16:22.610
And it would make sense,
them being

16:22.610 --> 16:23.740
in business with a Worm Hunter.

16:23.740 --> 16:26.190
(cell phone chimes)
Natural fibers from worms,

16:26.190 --> 16:29.610
insect larvae and spiders
are the cutting edge

16:29.610 --> 16:31.150
of ballistic textile research.

16:31.150 --> 16:33.820
They have the potential
to be stronger and lighter

16:33.820 --> 16:34.950
than anything synthetic.

16:34.950 --> 16:39.190
You and Marcus should, uh,
see what Hoyt Armor has to say.

16:39.190 --> 16:40.190
Where are you going?

16:40.190 --> 16:42.650
This is from a friend of mine
at the credit bureau.

16:42.650 --> 16:45.860
I have to go and see a man
about a job.

16:52.860 --> 16:53.700
(beep)

16:53.700 --> 16:58.200
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Sherlock Holmes, report
to the foreman’s office.

16:59.570 --> 17:01.820
You’re Sherlock Holmes?

17:02.280 --> 17:03.900
(Irish accent):
I am.

17:03.900 --> 17:05.700
What a coincidence.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.740
So am I.

17:12.190 --> 17:14.190
I don’t want trouble.

17:14.190 --> 17:16.530
But you have to understand,
I need this job.

17:16.530 --> 17:18.740
Yeah, you don’t need
to tell me your story,

17:18.740 --> 17:19.780
’cause I’ve already deduced it.

17:19.780 --> 17:21.700
The rattle in your lungs
indicates you spent

17:21.700 --> 17:22.819
some time working
around coal.

17:22.819 --> 17:24.190
Given your accent,
I’d say it was

17:24.190 --> 17:25.650
the Killroot Plant
in Northern Ireland,

17:25.650 --> 17:27.319
which recently went through
some massive layoffs.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.490
Post-Brexit, job prospects
in the UK are grim.

17:29.490 --> 17:31.190
So you came here,
but you decided to skip

17:31.190 --> 17:32.320
the rigmarole
of getting a work visa

17:32.320 --> 17:34.860
or a Green Card.
Am I right so far?

17:36.030 --> 17:37.280
Bang on.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.190
Unfortunately, you need
an Alien Resident Number

17:39.190 --> 17:42.190
to obtain work in America,
so you used mine.

17:42.190 --> 17:43.190
Don’t worry.

17:43.190 --> 17:46.030
I have no interest
in turning you over to ICE.

17:46.030 --> 17:50.240
I just want to know
where you got my A-Number.

18:03.490 --> 18:05.990
I bought it on a Dark Web site.

18:05.990 --> 18:07.820
Here’s the URL.

18:11.700 --> 18:13.530
Thank you.

18:14.990 --> 18:17.400
Look.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.110
The name "Sherlock Holmes,"

18:19.110 --> 18:22.190
it comes with certain
entanglements.

18:22.780 --> 18:24.570
I’d hate to see you assaulted,

18:24.570 --> 18:29.190
kidnapped or murdered
’cause of me.

18:29.650 --> 18:33.400
Get yourself a new identity
as soon as possible.

18:41.190 --> 18:42.240
HOYT:
I’m sorry.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.490
You think I killed Will
over some hoodie?

18:45.490 --> 18:48.240
We know you paid
him $200,000,

18:48.240 --> 18:49.320
probably for
his help

18:49.320 --> 18:51.860
developing next-gen
ballistic clothing

18:51.860 --> 18:53.070
from insect and
worm fibers.

18:53.070 --> 18:55.320
We also know that you were
not happy with his work.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.110
BELL: According to
Velnik’s neighbors,

18:57.110 --> 18:59.360
few weeks before the murder,
he got into a shouting match

18:59.360 --> 19:02.610
outside his place with a man
matching your description.

19:02.610 --> 19:05.190
Something about "delays"
and "broken promises."

19:05.190 --> 19:06.820
WATSON: We think
that you found out

19:06.820 --> 19:08.990
that he made his own
bulletproof garment.

19:08.990 --> 19:11.110
You thought that he
was holding out on you.

19:11.110 --> 19:13.030
Maybe shopping it
to other bidders.

19:13.030 --> 19:16.610
Now the hoodie’s missing,
and Velnik is dead.

19:16.610 --> 19:18.450
You said he was murdered
three weeks ago,

19:18.450 --> 19:19.780
Friday night?
Or thereabouts.

19:19.780 --> 19:21.700
That weekend,
I was supposed to be

19:21.700 --> 19:22.280
at a trade show,

19:22.280 --> 19:25.820
The truth is, I was with
a friend in Niagara Falls.

19:25.820 --> 19:27.860
A friend who is not my wife.

19:27.860 --> 19:30.110
We went over into Canada,
hit a casino.

19:30.110 --> 19:33.740
Plenty of cameras over there,
if you don’t believe me.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.190
Say we do believe you.

19:35.190 --> 19:36.780
You still could have
hired someone

19:36.780 --> 19:38.280
to kill Velnik
and take the hoodie.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.990
I didn’t even know
about the hoodie, okay?

19:40.990 --> 19:43.900
Did I pay Will? Sure,
but not to make anything.

19:43.900 --> 19:47.610
He’s the Worm Hunter,
and that’s what I hired him for:

19:47.610 --> 19:48.530
a worm hunt.

19:48.530 --> 19:52.190
What kind of worm hunt
is worth 200 grand?

19:52.190 --> 19:55.190
The kind that could
save my company.

19:55.190 --> 19:56.650
You’re right about bug fibers

19:56.650 --> 19:59.490
being the next big thing
in protective clothing,

19:59.490 --> 20:01.400
but that’s not
the whole story.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.610
No one’s been able to crack

20:02.610 --> 20:04.860
how to make them
in commercial quantities.

20:04.860 --> 20:06.900
That’s why I hired Will.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.190
To find bio-organic fibers

20:08.190 --> 20:10.320
we might be able
to synthesize in bulk.

20:10.320 --> 20:13.190
And after I went boot-to-ass
on him that night,

20:13.190 --> 20:14.700
he finally delivered.

20:14.700 --> 20:16.190
He got me
some samples.

20:16.190 --> 20:18.740
My chemists are working
on them right now.

20:18.740 --> 20:19.700
If that’s true,

20:19.700 --> 20:22.030
I’m assuming you had
an agreement in writing?

20:22.030 --> 20:24.530
We’ll want to see it
and the research.

20:24.530 --> 20:26.610
Be my guest.
There’s nothing about him

20:26.610 --> 20:28.150
making a prototype for us.

20:28.150 --> 20:30.190
Look, if he made one,
it must have come

20:30.190 --> 20:32.110
from the sample fibers
he collected.

20:32.110 --> 20:33.650
They’re rare,
but maybe he was able

20:33.650 --> 20:37.450
to pull together enough
for one sweatshirt.

20:37.860 --> 20:40.110
You know,
come to think of it,

20:40.110 --> 20:42.190
I may know why Will
would have wanted

20:42.190 --> 20:44.490
to make himself bulletproof.

20:45.190 --> 20:46.190
Look, a month ago,

20:46.190 --> 20:48.400
he told me someone
was e-mailing him

20:48.400 --> 20:49.900
anonymous death threats.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.400
I told him
not to sweat it.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.070
Sounded like nonsense.

20:53.070 --> 20:54.190
And now he’s dead.

20:54.190 --> 20:57.990
Obviously, I didn’t take
the threats seriously enough.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.190
But if I were you,

20:59.190 --> 21:02.360
I’d try to find the person
who sent them.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.400
(video game gunfire
sound effects)

21:05.400 --> 21:08.110
You playing a video game?

21:08.110 --> 21:08.860
Worse than that.

21:08.860 --> 21:11.650
I’m watching a recording
of a video game.

21:11.650 --> 21:12.780
Mason sent it.

21:12.780 --> 21:15.360
I’m solving
a crime for him,

21:15.360 --> 21:19.190
in exchange for him
solving two crimes for us.

21:19.190 --> 21:19.860
Okay.

21:19.860 --> 21:21.780
Plays this online game
where he’s part

21:21.780 --> 21:23.450
of a powerful
starship alliance.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.200
As you can see, he
and his friends engaged in, uh,

21:26.200 --> 21:29.950
all-out war with another armada
days ago.

21:29.950 --> 21:31.030
What was the crime?

21:31.030 --> 21:32.070
Just as
the battle began,

21:32.070 --> 21:36.030
a cloaked torpedo was fired
from behind Mason’s flagship,

21:36.030 --> 21:39.360
blowing it up
and triggering an utter rout

21:39.360 --> 21:40.030
of his side.

21:40.030 --> 21:42.900
He wants to know
who fired the fatal shot.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.900
You said, in exchange
for solving this crime,

21:44.900 --> 21:47.190
he was gonna help us
solve two crimes?

21:47.190 --> 21:50.240
Crime number one: the death
threats issued to Velnik.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.450
When you texted me about them,

21:51.450 --> 21:53.950
I thought finding the source
would be simple.

21:53.950 --> 21:55.240
Dig into Velnik’s e-mails.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.650
Back-trace the sender.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.900
Unfortunately,
according to CCS,

21:58.900 --> 22:00.190
his university e-mail account

22:00.190 --> 22:01.740
was deleted
right after his murder.

22:01.740 --> 22:04.740
Oh, so you’ve got Mason
restoring the information

22:04.740 --> 22:07.190
so you can find out
who sent the threats.

22:07.190 --> 22:08.700
So, what’s crime number two?

22:08.700 --> 22:11.240
Someone sold my A-Number
on the Dark Net,

22:11.240 --> 22:14.740
and Mason is trying to uncover
the name of the vendor.

22:14.740 --> 22:20.780
Lucky for him, I think
I’ve solved his little mystery.

22:21.190 --> 22:22.860
Who blew up his flagship?

22:22.860 --> 22:24.700
Oh, it’s very complicated.

22:24.700 --> 22:27.950
I spotted a slight recoil

22:27.950 --> 22:30.190
in another ship in his fleet

22:30.190 --> 22:33.990
just seconds before
the invisible torpedo struck.

22:33.990 --> 22:36.320
Well, the recoil
was from firing the torpedo.

22:36.320 --> 22:37.490
He was double-crossed.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.190
That’s not so complicated.

22:39.190 --> 22:41.320
It was fired by his girlfriend.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.650
Oh.

22:42.650 --> 22:44.530
(cell phone chimes)
Is that him?

22:44.530 --> 22:48.070
After a series
of cry-face emojis,

22:48.070 --> 22:49.610
Mason reports
that he has

22:49.610 --> 22:53.400
uncovered the source
of Velnik’s death threats.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.990
BELL:Quinn...

22:54.990 --> 22:55.990
we know you’re the one

22:55.990 --> 22:57.190
who sent Velnik
these death threats.

22:57.190 --> 22:59.190
Our expert traced them
to your office computer

22:59.190 --> 23:03.190
at the private equity
firm where you work.

23:05.190 --> 23:06.650
Okay.

23:06.650 --> 23:07.280
Fine.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.900
I sent Velnik the e-mails,
but it is not what you think.

23:10.900 --> 23:14.190
I’ve sent death threats to
dozens of people over the years.

23:14.190 --> 23:17.990
And that’s supposed to
make you look less guilty?

23:17.990 --> 23:19.860
These e-mails
aren’t just threats.

23:19.860 --> 23:23.280
They’re a delivery system
for a computer virus--

23:23.280 --> 23:24.320
technically a worm--

23:24.320 --> 23:28.150
that lets me download the data
of anyone who opens one.

23:28.530 --> 23:31.570
And you send them to anyone
who might have information

23:31.570 --> 23:33.820
related to the buyouts
and investments

23:33.820 --> 23:35.530
you’re considering.

23:35.530 --> 23:37.650
Why disguise your worm
as a death threat?

23:37.650 --> 23:39.990
People are pretty savvy
these days

23:39.990 --> 23:41.900
when it comes to opening
strange e-mails.

23:41.900 --> 23:45.190
But the one thing they’ll
never ignore is a threat.

23:45.190 --> 23:48.530
Since you sent one to Velnik,
I assume he had something

23:48.530 --> 23:51.030
to do with a company
you’re looking to buy?

23:51.030 --> 23:53.700
Velnik was consulting
for Hoyt Armor.

23:53.700 --> 23:58.570
The tactical fiber industry
is worth north of $100 billion.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.490
If Velnik had
the inside track

24:00.490 --> 24:02.190
on a newer, better
ballistic cloth,

24:02.190 --> 24:03.490
we wanted to buy Hoyt Armor

24:03.490 --> 24:06.490
before their valuation
went supernova.

24:06.490 --> 24:07.700
Only it was a bust.

24:07.700 --> 24:11.190
You didn’t get
the information you needed.

24:11.190 --> 24:12.150
Oh, I got it.

24:12.150 --> 24:14.530
It just proved Hoyt Armor
wasn’t worth the effort.

24:14.530 --> 24:16.860
When I looked
at Velnik’s research logs,

24:16.860 --> 24:19.190
I saw that he and Hoyt
weren’t even close

24:19.190 --> 24:21.400
to commercial production
of a new fiber.

24:21.400 --> 24:24.030
So we backed off of Hoyt Armor.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.740
End of story.

24:25.740 --> 24:27.190
BELL:
This data you stole--

24:27.190 --> 24:30.400
you wouldn’t happen
to still have it?

24:31.280 --> 24:34.400
BELL: "Incorporated
super-promoter in genome

24:34.400 --> 24:37.860
to ramp up levels
of acetylcholinester..."

24:37.860 --> 24:40.030
I can’t make heads
or tails of this stuff.

24:40.030 --> 24:42.360
Velnik only cared about
two things in life:

24:42.360 --> 24:43.190
sex and worms.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.990
I’m pretty sure this
is all about worms.

24:44.990 --> 24:48.360
Specifically nematodes,
also known as roundworms.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.110
As of late,
they seemed to be

24:50.110 --> 24:51.950
the entire focus
of his research.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.530
Cross-breeding
of roundworms,

24:53.530 --> 24:55.030
pesticide resistance
in roundworms.

24:55.030 --> 24:58.360
It’s roundworms as far
as the eye can see.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.700
This looks like
the fiber research

25:00.700 --> 25:03.190
that he did
for Hoyt Armor.

25:03.190 --> 25:04.190
Looks pretty thin.

25:04.190 --> 25:05.900
WATSON: Looks like
there’s only about

25:05.900 --> 25:07.280
a dozen or so
fiber samples.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.530
I mean, I haven’t done

25:08.530 --> 25:11.360
academic research
since medical school,

25:11.360 --> 25:12.450
but if you ask me,

25:12.450 --> 25:14.490
Velnik really phoned it in.

25:14.490 --> 25:15.990
The woman who gave you
these materials

25:15.990 --> 25:18.820
mined every last piece of data
from Velnik’s computer,

25:18.820 --> 25:20.860
and there’s
no indication

25:20.860 --> 25:22.190
that he gathered enough fibers

25:22.190 --> 25:24.570
to weave the bulletproof
hoodie himself

25:24.570 --> 25:26.740
or that he researched
design methods

25:26.740 --> 25:28.740
for ballistic cloth
or body armor.

25:28.740 --> 25:31.990
So you’re thinking he
wasn’t the one who made it.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.950
Well, if he didn’t,
who did?

25:33.950 --> 25:37.190
Someone who made off with it
after he was dead.

25:37.190 --> 25:39.280
So Velnik stole the hoodie
from someone,

25:39.280 --> 25:41.740
then three weeks ago,
that person stole it back?

25:41.740 --> 25:42.820
That what you’re saying?

25:42.820 --> 25:45.990
He was taking the threats
to his life seriously.

25:45.990 --> 25:48.110
The hoodie was meant
to protect him.

25:48.110 --> 25:51.700
Instead, it got him killed.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.990
You think Velnik was
killed by the person

25:55.990 --> 25:57.440
he took the prototype from.

25:58.540 --> 25:59.990
Or one of that person’s
competitors.

25:59.990 --> 26:02.950
They realized Velnik had the
hoodie, so they went and got it.

26:02.950 --> 26:04.870
Sherlock’s going through
Velnik’s research logs,

26:04.870 --> 26:06.990
hoping to I.D. the labs
he might have visited

26:06.990 --> 26:09.990
when he was doing
his research for Hoyt Armor.

26:09.990 --> 26:11.990
(cell phone chimes)

26:12.540 --> 26:13.540
That’s him.

26:13.540 --> 26:15.830
He says,
"Meet me at Rodman’s Neck.

26:15.830 --> 26:17.330
Bring Donnie Mainzer’s gun."

26:17.330 --> 26:20.990
He wants you to bring
the gun used to shoot Velnik

26:20.990 --> 26:22.990
to a firing range?

26:22.990 --> 26:24.750
Why?

26:25.040 --> 26:26.790
(scoffs)
I gotta say,

26:26.790 --> 26:27.990
this feels like cheating.

26:27.990 --> 26:29.950
HOLMES: Well, it would be
if this had anything

26:29.950 --> 26:31.990
to do with marksmanship,
but it doesn’t.

26:31.990 --> 26:33.790
We’re testing
ballistic fiber.

26:33.790 --> 26:36.450
Donnie Mainzer fired
at point-blank range.

26:36.450 --> 26:37.250
So must you.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.870
Even if it does give you
an unfair advantage

26:39.870 --> 26:40.990
in your gentleman’s duel

26:40.990 --> 26:44.080
with test dummies
filled with fake blood.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.370
Don’t worry.

26:45.370 --> 26:48.200
I’m not throwing away my shot.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.660
(three gunshots)

26:49.660 --> 26:53.250
BELL:
Oh, that’s the last of them.

26:53.250 --> 26:56.790
Three dead, two wounded.

27:00.660 --> 27:03.250
So, I never asked.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.500
Almost afraid to.

27:04.500 --> 27:07.200
But how did you get
five samples of experimental

27:07.200 --> 27:09.200
ballistic cloth in
less than a day?

27:09.200 --> 27:11.950
Well, while there are downsides
to coming from a family

27:11.950 --> 27:14.500
with the wealth and influence
of a small nation-state,

27:14.500 --> 27:18.250
when a Holmes walks into a lab
and offers to invest millions

27:18.250 --> 27:20.870
in their next-gen,
bio-organic fiber,

27:20.870 --> 27:22.250
they tend to deliver.

27:22.250 --> 27:23.450
But how’s it gonna look

27:23.450 --> 27:25.990
when you don’t fund
any of the labs?

27:25.990 --> 27:26.990
Who says I won’t?

27:26.990 --> 27:28.620
This is life-saving
technology.

27:28.620 --> 27:29.660
Or it’s supposed to be.

27:29.660 --> 27:32.200
That one has severe
internal bleeding.

27:32.910 --> 27:33.990
Pretty sure this one

27:33.990 --> 27:35.200
would have made it.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.620
Hairline fractures,

27:36.620 --> 27:38.290
just like on Velnik.

27:38.290 --> 27:42.750
Well, guess it’s time
to pay Orb-Lite labs a visit.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.330
(over phone):
It’s Mason. Hang up and text me.

27:45.330 --> 27:48.910
Mason, I’ve yet to receive
the results of your second task,

27:48.910 --> 27:50.580
so imagine my annoyance
when I logged on

27:50.580 --> 27:52.580
to your space game
to see that you’ve started

27:52.580 --> 27:55.500
to rebuild your alliance
with your treacherous girlfriend

27:55.500 --> 27:57.410
rather than finding my thief.

27:57.410 --> 28:01.540
Fulfill the terms of our deal,
or I will join your game

28:01.540 --> 28:05.250
and I will lay
your home world to ashes.

28:07.750 --> 28:08.620
That’s harsh.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.120
It’s deserved,
I assure you.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.290
WOMAN:
Mr. Holmes,

28:11.290 --> 28:12.750
sorry to keep
you waiting.

28:12.750 --> 28:15.250
I had to secure some of
our free-range specimens

28:15.250 --> 28:17.950
before I could
let you...

28:17.950 --> 28:18.990
inside.

28:18.990 --> 28:21.750
Wait. Are you the police?

28:21.750 --> 28:22.580
Detective Bell.

28:22.580 --> 28:25.700
We need to ask you
some questions.

28:26.370 --> 28:29.830
WOMAN: I gave you that ballistic
cloth sample in good faith,

28:29.830 --> 28:31.990
and now you’re accusing me
of murder?

28:31.990 --> 28:34.200
Consider it additional vetting.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.330
I may well invest
in your lab.

28:36.330 --> 28:37.450
But that would be contingent

28:37.450 --> 28:40.200
on whether or not
you killed William Velnik.

28:40.200 --> 28:44.790
This hoodie you think he stole--
it’s not possible.

28:44.790 --> 28:46.410
Because Orb-Lite didn’t make it.

28:46.410 --> 28:47.830
We couldn’t have.

28:47.830 --> 28:49.660
You sent him a sample
of ballistic cloth

28:49.660 --> 28:51.000
that behaved exactly
like that hoodie.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.990
Same characteristics,
same results.

28:53.990 --> 28:55.540
Same spider.

28:55.540 --> 28:57.080
The hoodie you described
must use

28:57.080 --> 28:59.540
the same base material we do.

28:59.990 --> 29:03.330
Silk from Darwin’s bark spiders.

29:03.330 --> 29:05.410
That’s how you make
the cloth so thin.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.660
Darwin’s bark spiders

29:06.660 --> 29:07.990
are from Madagascar.

29:07.990 --> 29:09.990
Their silk is ten times
stronger than Kevlar.

29:09.990 --> 29:12.660
How did you get enough
of them in one place

29:12.660 --> 29:13.830
to produce any sort of output?

29:13.830 --> 29:16.160
That’s what I’m trying
to tell you.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.500
We didn’t.

29:17.500 --> 29:18.660
So far, we haven’t

29:18.660 --> 29:21.500
produced enough cloth
to make a tank top,

29:21.500 --> 29:23.620
let alone a sweatshirt.

29:26.330 --> 29:27.700
Follow me.

29:27.700 --> 29:28.950
I’ll show you.

29:28.950 --> 29:32.990
Darwin’s bark spider silk
is ideal for tactical cloth.

29:32.990 --> 29:35.660
The problem is,
they’re cannibals.

29:35.660 --> 29:37.450
We’ve tried
hormones, drugs,

29:37.450 --> 29:39.990
but nothing stops
the killing.

29:39.990 --> 29:40.790
The only solution

29:40.790 --> 29:42.870
is an individual enclosure
for each spider.

29:42.870 --> 29:44.870
But we’d need hundreds
of thousands of spiders

29:44.870 --> 29:46.700
to make enough silk
to go into production.

29:46.700 --> 29:48.990
BELL: So you’d need
the same number of enclosures

29:48.990 --> 29:51.080
and a facility
the size of a football field.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.120
The cost would be
astronomical.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.660
Right now, we have 20 spiders.

29:54.660 --> 29:55.660
The sample we gave you

29:55.660 --> 29:58.120
was six months’ worth
of their production.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.870
Dr. Elke and I are trying

29:59.870 --> 30:01.290
to find a way
to scale up,

30:01.290 --> 30:04.120
but so far, we’ve struck out.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.500
So, whoever made

30:05.500 --> 30:07.000
the hoodie you were
talking about

30:07.000 --> 30:11.160
must have figured out how to
mass-produce bark spider silk.

30:11.160 --> 30:12.700
It just wasn’t us.

30:12.700 --> 30:14.620
BELL: We’ll need
your research notes.

30:14.620 --> 30:16.040
And it’ll help
if you both provide

30:16.040 --> 30:17.540
an alibi for the time
of the murder,

30:17.540 --> 30:19.790
but I think we’re done here.
HOLMES: Actually...

30:19.790 --> 30:23.160
I-I see your enclosures
are heavily fortified.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.830
Bark spiders, I know,
are cannibals,

30:24.830 --> 30:26.500
but are they also
escape artists?

30:26.500 --> 30:29.450
Um, a few spiders
got out last year,

30:29.450 --> 30:30.910
so we upgraded

30:30.910 --> 30:32.990
to more secure enclosures.
Why?

30:32.990 --> 30:35.370
Perhaps someone
helped them escape.

30:35.370 --> 30:37.080
You think someone
took them?

30:37.080 --> 30:39.750
Hmm. I mean, the spiders
are valuable.

30:39.750 --> 30:40.870
But Dr. Elke and I

30:40.870 --> 30:42.830
are the only ones with
access to this lab.

30:42.830 --> 30:44.990
No one else gets in
unsupervised.

30:44.990 --> 30:46.870
Really?
What about whoever was

30:46.870 --> 30:48.370
having sex in
that chair?

30:48.370 --> 30:49.450
I’m sorry. What?

30:49.450 --> 30:51.200
Well, the signs
are quite clear

30:51.200 --> 30:52.790
to anyone with a keen eye

30:52.790 --> 30:54.080
and a sensitive nose.
(sniffs)

30:54.080 --> 30:57.160
I mean, aside from the, uh,
biological trace evidence,

30:57.160 --> 30:58.990
the scuff marks
beneath the chair

30:58.990 --> 31:01.700
indicate a sort
of rhythmic movement.

31:01.700 --> 31:02.950
I see no indication that you

31:02.950 --> 31:04.870
and Dr. Elke are partners,
so perhaps

31:04.870 --> 31:07.410
one of you had help
in making them.

31:07.410 --> 31:08.660
Scott?

31:08.660 --> 31:09.540
I...

31:09.540 --> 31:14.000
I’ve, uh, kind of been
hooking up with someone

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
on and off

31:15.000 --> 31:16.620
for the past year.

31:16.620 --> 31:19.080
I work long hours,
so sometimes she, uh...

31:19.080 --> 31:20.160
(clears throat)
visits.

31:20.160 --> 31:23.790
Was she here the night
your spiders got out?

31:23.790 --> 31:26.250
She asked me
to go get some wine.

31:26.250 --> 31:27.950
I was gone 15 minutes, tops.

31:27.950 --> 31:31.040
Afterwards I thought
we bumped the enclosures,

31:31.040 --> 31:31.910
you know, during,

31:31.910 --> 31:36.040
and that’s how
the spiders escaped, but...

31:36.040 --> 31:37.990
Now you think she stole them.

31:37.990 --> 31:39.540
She have a name?

31:39.540 --> 31:40.790
Uh, Sepi.

31:40.790 --> 31:41.990
Sepi Chamanara.

31:41.990 --> 31:43.990
She’s a professor
at Millerton University.

31:43.990 --> 31:45.990
SEPI:Okay.

31:45.990 --> 31:48.040
Maybe I stole a few spiders.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.540
But come on, they’re spiders.

31:50.540 --> 31:51.620
And we’ve been
over this.

31:51.620 --> 31:53.580
I was with someone
the night Will died.

31:53.580 --> 31:54.990
WATSON: Actually,
I talked to her.

31:54.990 --> 31:56.950
After I explained
what we think you did,

31:56.950 --> 31:58.620
she admitted that she didn’t
know exactly

31:58.620 --> 32:00.040
what time you showed up
at her place

32:00.040 --> 32:01.990
the night of the murder.
HOLMES: You recently bid

32:01.990 --> 32:04.370
on a lucrative contract
to provide body armor

32:04.370 --> 32:05.990
to federal law enforcement.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.990
BELL: The bid included
photos of your prototype,

32:07.990 --> 32:12.200
which looks exactly like the one
we saw Professor Velnik wearing.

32:12.200 --> 32:15.500
We figure Velnik found out about
your prototype and stole it.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.700
For a while,
you didn’t know it was him.

32:17.700 --> 32:19.990
Then Donnie Mainzer
entered the picture.

32:19.990 --> 32:22.290
We know you were on campus
that night.

32:22.290 --> 32:23.250
You heard shots.

32:23.250 --> 32:25.160
You ran to help him,
but then you saw him

32:25.160 --> 32:26.200
wearing your missing hoodie.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.450
He’d violated your trust.

32:27.450 --> 32:28.580
You lost your temper.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.790
There was
a screwdriver nearby.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.990
You guys are really desperate
to pin this on someone,

32:34.990 --> 32:35.990
aren’t you?

32:35.990 --> 32:38.990
You are right
about one thing, though.

32:38.990 --> 32:40.200
That is my hoodie.

32:40.200 --> 32:41.580
But Will
didn’t steal it.

32:41.580 --> 32:44.370
When he told me about the
death threats he’d been getting,

32:44.370 --> 32:46.750
I was worried about him,
so I gave him one.

32:46.750 --> 32:49.000
You just handed over
your prototype?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.120
I have dozens
of them.

32:50.120 --> 32:52.620
If you’d like, I can bring
a boxful to the station.

32:52.620 --> 32:54.200
HOLMES: You’ve found
a way to mass-produce

32:54.200 --> 32:56.080
Darwin’s bark spider silk?

32:56.080 --> 32:58.990
A way that no one else
can duplicate.

32:58.990 --> 33:01.120
See for yourselves.

33:01.120 --> 33:02.040
It’s a silkworm farm.

33:02.040 --> 33:05.660
I took the genes
from a Darwin’s bark spider

33:05.660 --> 33:07.250
and spliced them into silkworms.

33:07.250 --> 33:09.290
Now the worms spin their cocoons

33:09.290 --> 33:11.250
out of bulletproof
spider silk.

33:11.250 --> 33:12.330
The process is proprietary,

33:12.330 --> 33:14.580
and it cannot
be reverse-engineered.

33:14.580 --> 33:15.910
Which means that no one,

33:15.910 --> 33:18.990
not even if they got their hands
on one of my prototypes,

33:18.990 --> 33:19.990
could steal it.

33:19.990 --> 33:24.990
So, if you’re looking
for motive to kill Will,

33:24.990 --> 33:26.330
I don’t have one.

33:26.330 --> 33:27.750
HOLMES:Well, Sepi Chamanara

33:27.750 --> 33:29.990
is as talented a liar
as she is a geneticist,

33:29.990 --> 33:31.160
but she’s a liar nonetheless.

33:31.160 --> 33:33.540
I don’t trust her, either,
but we still don’t have

33:33.540 --> 33:35.040
any way to link her
to Velnik’s murder.

33:35.040 --> 33:37.250
You’re wrong about that,
and so is she.

33:37.250 --> 33:37.990
We have motive.

33:37.990 --> 33:39.290
In the photographs
she showed us,

33:39.290 --> 33:40.660
did you notice
the mulberry leaves

33:40.660 --> 33:41.990
that her silkworms
were eating?

33:41.990 --> 33:43.040
They should be green and plump.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.540
Instead, they were jaundiced
and brittle.

33:45.540 --> 33:47.370
That’s why she killed Velnik.

33:47.370 --> 33:49.330
Because of yellow
mulberry leaves?

33:49.330 --> 33:50.990
Because he was a mass murderer.

33:50.990 --> 33:52.200
He’d figured out a way to kill

33:52.200 --> 33:53.950
tens of thousands
of her silkworms,

33:53.950 --> 33:56.160
and she killed him
to avenge them.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.990
Now we just have to prove it.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.120
GREGSON: You’ve been
holding out on us, Mr. Hoyt.

34:03.120 --> 34:06.450
When my people spoke to you
earlier, you failed to mention

34:06.450 --> 34:07.870
the little conspiracy

34:08.870 --> 34:10.989
you had cooking with
William Velnik.

34:10.989 --> 34:13.250
We spoke
to Sepi Chamanara today.

34:13.250 --> 34:14.449
Does that name
ring a bell?

34:14.449 --> 34:17.989
She told us that she’s
using transgenic silkworms

34:17.989 --> 34:19.330
to mass-produce spider silk.

34:19.330 --> 34:21.290
Apparently, it’s going
to revolutionize

34:21.290 --> 34:23.790
the body armor business.
BELL: When she showed us

34:23.790 --> 34:24.989
pictures of her silk farm,

34:24.989 --> 34:26.989
something caught
our colleague’s eye.

34:26.989 --> 34:29.500
Her silk farm is half empty.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.370
There were racks for twice
as many worms as she had,

34:32.370 --> 34:33.989
and the worms that
were in the pictures

34:33.989 --> 34:36.449
were feeding on wilted,
yellow leaves.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.949
I’m not following you.

34:37.949 --> 34:40.620
What does that have to do
with me and Will?

34:40.620 --> 34:42.989
Those silkworms are potentially
worth billions of dollars.

34:42.989 --> 34:47.989
Why feed them sick leaves
unless she had no other choice?

34:47.989 --> 34:49.449
WATSON:
Now, the funny
thing about

34:49.449 --> 34:51.500
genetically engineered
species-- they often have

34:51.500 --> 34:52.909
highly specialized diets.

34:52.909 --> 34:55.370
Now, as far as we can
tell, Sepi’s silkworms

34:55.370 --> 34:58.290
could only eat the leaves
of a very specific,

34:58.290 --> 35:00.290
very rare subspecies
of mulberry.

35:00.290 --> 35:01.910
GREGSON: Probably
why she planted

35:01.910 --> 35:06.290
an entire orchard of those trees
at her silkworm farm.

35:06.290 --> 35:08.500
Only her special trees

35:08.500 --> 35:09.990
looked like they were dying.

35:09.990 --> 35:12.410
BELL:
That’s where you come
into the picture.

35:12.410 --> 35:13.410
Those dying trees.

35:13.410 --> 35:14.870
Our associate
was able to tell

35:14.870 --> 35:16.290
from the look of
those yellow leaves

35:16.290 --> 35:17.990
that Sepi’s trees
were being killed

35:17.990 --> 35:21.040
by something called
root-knot roundworms.

35:21.040 --> 35:23.700
WATSON:
Now, according
to Velnik’s

35:23.700 --> 35:24.660
research logs,

35:24.660 --> 35:27.290
he spent the better part
of the past year

35:27.290 --> 35:30.950
breeding pesticide-resistant
root-knot roundworms.

35:30.950 --> 35:32.990
BELL:
Sepi Chamanara
is bidding

35:32.990 --> 35:35.990
for a huge body armor contract
with the Feds.

35:35.990 --> 35:38.990
As it turns out, you’re
the current contract holder.

35:38.990 --> 35:42.080
You knew, if you lost it,
your company would go under.

35:42.080 --> 35:43.950
So you had Velnik
breed those worms

35:43.950 --> 35:46.000
for the express purpose
of killing Sepi’s trees.

35:46.000 --> 35:51.990
Her worms would starve,
and Hoyt Armor would be saved.

35:52.990 --> 35:54.950
It was Will’s idea.

35:54.950 --> 35:56.990
He found out about
Sepi’s silkworms,

35:56.990 --> 35:59.990
said they were
the next big thing.

35:59.990 --> 36:03.700
He told me he could
sabotage them-- for a price.

36:03.700 --> 36:05.500
An aggressive prosecutor
could probably

36:05.500 --> 36:07.660
turn this into a RICO case.

36:07.660 --> 36:09.790
But lucky for you,

36:09.790 --> 36:11.000
we only want Sepi.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.290
You give us
something we can use

36:13.290 --> 36:18.830
to nail her for Velnik’s murder,
and we’re done here.

36:19.990 --> 36:22.830
She saved her trees.

36:22.830 --> 36:23.990
What does that mean?

36:23.990 --> 36:25.990
I have a friend
on the approval board

36:25.990 --> 36:27.580
for that body armor contract.

36:27.580 --> 36:28.990
After Will worked his magic,

36:28.990 --> 36:30.990
he told me Sepi’s worms
were starving

36:30.990 --> 36:33.990
and that her chance of
landing that contract was nil.

36:33.990 --> 36:35.700
But a few weeks back,
my friend e-mails me,

36:35.700 --> 36:37.700
tells me that Sepi’s
the frontrunner again.

36:37.700 --> 36:38.620
That somehow she saved

36:38.620 --> 36:41.700
her damn trees
from Will’s roundworms.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.950
This was five days
after he was murdered.

36:44.950 --> 36:46.540
Call me crazy, but...

36:46.540 --> 36:49.990
somehow that’s gotta be
connected, right?

37:16.870 --> 37:19.080
(grunting)

37:22.830 --> 37:24.910
What the hell, man?

37:24.910 --> 37:26.990
What are you doing in my place?

37:26.990 --> 37:28.200
It’s not your place.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.200
Your name is Nick Agnes.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.990
You recently broke
into a doctor’s office,

37:30.990 --> 37:32.990
and you stole a bunch
of patient files.

37:32.990 --> 37:34.290
You’ve been selling
the information

37:34.290 --> 37:36.200
in those files online, hmm?

37:36.200 --> 37:38.990
(panting):
God.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.790
It’s you.

37:40.790 --> 37:42.500
The guy with the weird name.

37:42.500 --> 37:43.990
Sherlock, right?

37:43.990 --> 37:46.200
You’re the one
he wanted to know about.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.000
What?
This guy.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.950
He-he called me
a couple weeks ago.

37:50.950 --> 37:53.450
Said he knew all about me.

37:53.450 --> 37:55.120
(panting)

37:55.120 --> 37:57.370
Drug problem.

37:57.370 --> 37:58.290
Crimes I’d done.

37:58.290 --> 38:00.990
Things that would get me
locked up unless I did

38:00.990 --> 38:02.330
exactly what he said.

38:02.330 --> 38:03.450
Which was?

38:03.450 --> 38:05.950
Rob the doctor’s office.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.830
He said I could take
whatever I wanted

38:07.830 --> 38:11.160
and sell it, but to make sure
that I got your file.

38:11.160 --> 38:14.200
He said it was
real important.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.200
What was his name?

38:16.200 --> 38:18.160
This is outrageous.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.620
I came here because you said
you had more questions

38:20.620 --> 38:22.660
about Will,
and now you’re, what,

38:22.660 --> 38:24.330
accusing me of stabbing him

38:24.330 --> 38:27.580
because he was killing
my mulberry trees

38:27.580 --> 38:29.250
and starving
my silkworms?

38:29.250 --> 38:31.080
My trees are fine.

38:31.080 --> 38:33.290
I can prove it.

38:33.290 --> 38:35.120
So can we.

38:41.910 --> 38:44.540
We got these from
your silkworm farm.

38:44.540 --> 38:47.370
You had your workers
spraying your trees with them.

38:47.370 --> 38:49.990
One’s a pesticide
called Versacarb.

38:49.990 --> 38:53.290
The other is DBDP.

38:53.290 --> 38:55.330
It’s funny.
Normally, neither one

38:55.330 --> 38:57.620
is any good
at killing roundworms.

38:57.620 --> 38:58.540
In spite of that,

38:58.540 --> 39:00.990
the day after Velnik died,
you had your foreman

39:00.990 --> 39:04.620
spraying your orchard
with both of them.

39:04.620 --> 39:05.910
And like magic,

39:05.910 --> 39:07.830
your trees started
to recover.

39:07.830 --> 39:09.410
BELL:
Only it wasn’t magic.

39:09.410 --> 39:12.120
It was Velnik’s last ounce
of scientific ethics.

39:12.120 --> 39:14.950
Before he turned his roundworms
loose on your trees,

39:14.950 --> 39:16.870
he engineered a weakness
into them.

39:16.870 --> 39:19.750
A failsafe in
case they spread.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.040
He only wanted your trees dead,

39:21.040 --> 39:23.450
not every mulberry tree
in the world.

39:23.450 --> 39:25.540
So he made his roundworms
susceptible

39:25.540 --> 39:29.160
to a combination of
Versacarb and DBDP.

39:29.160 --> 39:31.990
But he didn’t tell
anyone else how to kill them.

39:31.990 --> 39:34.990
Not even the man paying him,
Jon Hoyt.

39:34.990 --> 39:37.290
So the only way you
could have known

39:37.290 --> 39:40.990
was if you got your hands
on his research.

39:40.990 --> 39:44.250
We executed a search warrant
on your home this morning.

39:44.250 --> 39:46.870
We found Professor Velnik’s

39:46.870 --> 39:47.990
missing hard drive.

39:47.990 --> 39:51.750
There was even
a little blood on it.

39:56.990 --> 39:59.040
It was like you said yesterday.

39:59.040 --> 40:02.250
I was in my lab
when I heard shots.

40:02.250 --> 40:03.990
I went to help.

40:03.990 --> 40:07.620
Somewhere along the way,
I grabbed a screwdriver

40:07.620 --> 40:09.080
to protect myself.

40:09.080 --> 40:13.830
When I got to his office,
I was so relieved.

40:13.830 --> 40:15.450
Will was alive.

40:15.450 --> 40:18.660
My hoodie had saved him.

40:20.950 --> 40:23.200
But just as I went to call 911,

40:23.200 --> 40:25.830
I saw what he’d
been working on.

40:25.830 --> 40:27.790
Root-knot roundworms.

40:27.790 --> 40:31.750
The same kind
that had been killing my trees.

40:32.790 --> 40:36.040
Rage is a biological impulse.

40:36.040 --> 40:37.830
Just like lust.

40:37.830 --> 40:40.990
It all comes
from the same place.

40:40.990 --> 40:43.450
We have this...

40:43.450 --> 40:45.540
drive.

40:45.540 --> 40:46.990
To survive

40:46.990 --> 40:51.540
