WEBVTT

01:28.881 --> 01:31.716
I'll tell you a secret.
We could be more profitable.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.759
Small places here and there,

01:32.843 --> 01:35.094
we could make more money.
You know why we don't?

01:35.179 --> 01:36.554
We choose not to.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.889
It's a hell of a business plan, Reese.

01:37.973 --> 01:39.766
Have a seat if you want.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.809
There's coffee and juice over there.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.102
How did you find out?

01:43.187 --> 01:45.563
We didn't find out. We figured it out.
That's an important distinction.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.065
We could have found out by you telling us.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.817
But Sloan Sabbith figured it out

01:49.902 --> 01:51.944
when instead of going down
off a weak earnings report,

01:52.488 --> 01:56.532
our stock traded up because someone
was buying 5% of our shares.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.618
-6%.
-6%.

01:58.702 --> 02:02.371
Which, when added to the 45%
that vests when you turn 25,

02:02.456 --> 02:04.290
comes out to a total of what, Randy?

02:04.374 --> 02:06.209
King Arthur's knights
could have jousted on this table.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.127
51 %, that's right.

02:08.212 --> 02:09.796
Please don't give my brother a math quiz.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.172
I wasn't testing his math.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.882
I was testing his attention span.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.301
-Reese. You're a douche.
-Yeah? Yes, I am.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.303
But I'm a douche on the side of the angels.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.639
And the reason there are areas,
small places here and there

02:19.723 --> 02:21.849
where we choose not to be more profitable

02:22.226 --> 02:24.769
is because we define success
a little different than you do.

02:25.354 --> 02:28.439
For instance, we have a news division.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.070
- Are you nervous?
- No.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.113
Really?

02:36.198 --> 02:37.406
-I'm okay.
-Mmm.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.159
-I'd be nervous.
-I'm fine.

02:40.244 --> 02:41.410
-Here she comes.
-Yeah.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.578
-Don't be nervous.
-I'm not.

02:43.413 --> 02:47.166
I would love it if you guys
would stop committing federal crimes.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.001
Listen, we're a team here. We're a family.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.586
But just to be clear, he's the one who did it.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.880
Before we start, Neal,

02:53.257 --> 02:55.842
it's very important that
you don't reveal your source to me.

02:55.926 --> 02:56.926
Yeah, no, I won't.

02:57.261 --> 02:58.636
If you were to reveal your source

02:58.720 --> 03:00.596
and then even in the course
of an informal conversation

03:00.681 --> 03:03.683
told me you were planning on continuing
to commit this very serious felony,

03:04.184 --> 03:06.394
attorney-client privilege
wouldn't protect either one of us.

03:06.645 --> 03:07.645
He's been prepped.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.021
By whom?

03:09.439 --> 03:12.358
By a member of the New York bar
who graduated seventh in his class

03:12.442 --> 03:14.235
from the fourth best law school in America.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.361
Okay.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.448
Well, as a member of the New York,
California, Illinois, and Florida bars

03:19.533 --> 03:22.535
who graduated second in her class
from the third best law school in the world,

03:22.870 --> 03:24.912
you won't mind if I sweep up after you a little?

03:24.997 --> 03:30.001
Because this is different than prosecuting
an escort service in Greenpoint.

03:30.085 --> 03:33.296
I put away bad guys, Halliday.
I locked up Mafia dons.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.465
And now when you go to work,
you put on makeup, just like me.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.217
Say you want another lawyer.

03:38.302 --> 03:40.970
If it's gonna be like this,
I'd honestly prefer to go to jail.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.722
When they were just your age,

03:42.806 --> 03:46.267
my mother's parents saw a production of
You Can't Take It With You on Broadway.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.396
They thought it was a shame
that you had to live near New York

03:50.480 --> 03:53.274
or be able to afford to come here
on vacation to see a production that good.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.526
So they went to investors

03:56.111 --> 04:00.114
and they put together $42,350

04:00.198 --> 04:01.616
and mounted a touring company.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.912
National Theatricals became very successful.

04:05.996 --> 04:09.874
And my mother worked in the office
while she was going to City College.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.376
She discovered a small string
of radio stations

04:12.461 --> 04:14.045
that were going out of business,

04:14.129 --> 04:16.839
and using National as collateral,

04:16.965 --> 04:19.342
she got a loan and bought
the company that owned them,

04:19.426 --> 04:21.385
which was named after a mythical city,

04:22.429 --> 04:23.888
Atlantis Media.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.642
She was 22 years old at the time.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.436
She met our father

04:30.520 --> 04:31.979
and they got married.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.397
And then she had a son

04:33.482 --> 04:36.192
who bore a striking resemblance
to the father's brother.

04:36.652 --> 04:39.487
If we're gonna start at 212 degrees,
we've got no place to go.

04:40.572 --> 04:43.240
In the divorce, she gave him half
the controlling shares of the company,

04:43.325 --> 04:44.784
or 45%.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.786
With another 45% going to you.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.246
- I own no stock in AWM.
- In your mother's will.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.289
I don't know what's in my mother's will.

04:50.374 --> 04:51.374
I don't like to think about it.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.625
You know exactly what's
in your mother's will.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.877
Is this what this is? Is this a family feud?

04:56.380 --> 04:59.173
'Cause we're not talking about
Elton John's birthday party now.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.341
Lives are on the line.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.678
Do me a favor and talk to me
with a little more condescension.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.346
Great day in the morning.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.682
Randy and Blair are in the house.

05:07.766 --> 05:08.808
Morning.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.894
Did you know I've known these two
since the minute they were born?

05:11.979 --> 05:15.398
Your father's plane was grounded in the snow

05:15.482 --> 05:17.984
and he called me from a pay phone and said,

05:18.068 --> 05:20.736
"Charlie, get yourself
to Columbia Presbyterian.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.031
"Monica's in labor and I want to
make sure nobody steals my kids."

05:24.825 --> 05:27.785
I wasn't in the delivery room,
'cause, you know, boundaries.

05:27.869 --> 05:31.747
But we're all family here, is my point.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.208
Randy, you're an absolute knockout.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.961
And, Blair, you've grown
into a fine young man.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.046
I'm Blair. He's Randy.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.091
All right, well, that was bound to happen.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.510
Look, I don't get involved
at the corporate level.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.721
I just came in to say hello.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.139
I'm not even sitting down.

05:48.223 --> 05:50.307
But out of curiosity,

05:50.392 --> 05:52.518
if you were to sell the company,

05:52.602 --> 05:56.313
what would the new owners'
plans be for ACN?

05:56.773 --> 05:58.107
I really don't know, Charlie,

05:58.191 --> 06:00.526
but from what I understand,
you can make more money

06:00.610 --> 06:03.362
selling the cameras than
transmitting images from them.

06:03.447 --> 06:05.740
So, I imagine that's what they'll do.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.659
Yeah, I'm gonna sit down.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.662
Let's start at the beginning. Monday night.

06:11.872 --> 06:12.872
Go ahead.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.457
You don't have to tell him to go ahead,
I just did.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.917
And I was telling him
it was okay to follow your instruction.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.002
Go ahead.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.713
It was the first night of the Boston story

06:20.797 --> 06:23.299
and I got a message on the site
asking for my encryption key.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.425
I gave it.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.969
Then I was asked for a higher level
of encryption and I gave that.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.638
The source instructed me
to buy an air-gapped computer,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.724
a computer that's never been
hooked up to the Internet.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.684
And he told me where
he had hidden the flash drive.

06:33.769 --> 06:36.103
It was hidden Godfather-style
in a restaurant bathroom.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.188
Godfather-style?

06:37.272 --> 06:39.231
The scene where Michael shoots
Barzini and the cop.

06:39.316 --> 06:40.399
-McCluskey.
-Right.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.443
- And it was Sollozzo.
- The cop?

06:42.527 --> 06:43.527
The cop was McCluskey.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.613
It was McCluskey and Sollozzo, not Barzini.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.281
-Maybe we can move past this.
-You got the flash drive...

06:47.365 --> 06:48.741
And loaded it onto the air-gapped computer.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.409
And what was on the drive?

06:50.494 --> 06:53.996
A little more than 27,000 documents
belonging to the DOD.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.164
About half of them classified.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.499
Tell her about Kundu.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.752
There's a small African country
called the Republic of Equatorial Kundu.

06:59.836 --> 07:00.920
It's a failed state.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.964
The week before last,
there were violent riots that killed 38 people,

07:04.049 --> 07:05.341
including three Americans.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.219
We're the ones who started the riots.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.428
How?

07:09.513 --> 07:12.014
The Pentagon employs a PR firm
in Virginia called BCD.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.599
They do propaganda work

07:13.683 --> 07:16.644
planting positive stories
about the US in local papers.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.271
But this time, they planted a story in Kundu

07:19.356 --> 07:22.191
about a rebel leader
who was about to attack another rebel group.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.693
The story was false
and now 38 people are dead.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.988
In order to be able to better convince
Charlie to spend the money

07:28.073 --> 07:30.407
on investigators to go
through the 27,000 documents,

07:30.492 --> 07:33.661
I asked the source to get me
a couple of pieces of persuasive evidence,

07:33.745 --> 07:35.663
-and I taught him how to use the NIPRNet...
-Yeah.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.706
...to move it from
the DOD's computer to mine.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.791
You were aware these were

07:38.875 --> 07:40.126
- stolen documents?
- Yes.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.210
And you asked your source

07:41.294 --> 07:42.419
-to steal some more?
-Yes.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.088
You even taught him how to do it?

07:44.714 --> 07:45.798
Yeah.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.466
Well, here's what you've done.

07:48.844 --> 07:51.262
You've committed espionage.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.932
You violated Title 18, Section 793.

07:55.016 --> 07:58.185
Aside from the Espionage Act,
you can and will be charged with violating

07:58.270 --> 08:01.814
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
as well as federal statutes

08:01.898 --> 08:05.192
that punish the theft or retention of stolen...

08:05.277 --> 08:07.069
I mean, I know these guys get legal training.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.654
How does this happen?

08:08.780 --> 08:10.489
Isn't this the very first thing
they're taught not to do?

08:10.574 --> 08:12.032
-Once a year.
-Like, is there a sign hanging somewhere?

08:12.117 --> 08:13.409
It's not like they take
a semester of criminal law.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.493
Like a choking hazard sign?

08:14.578 --> 08:17.913
"Don't ask sources to steal things for you."

08:18.415 --> 08:20.499
Title 18, 641.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.793
Title 18, 793-E.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.837
18, 1030-a.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.964
And you violated the USA Patriot Act.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.341
Seems like the US government
has an awful lot of laws

08:29.426 --> 08:30.885
protecting itself from its citizens.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.470
That's one way of looking at it.
It's a stupid way.

08:33.555 --> 08:35.055
Is the DOD aware of this yet?

08:35.140 --> 08:38.601
No, but if we were to run the story,
which we obviously won't,

08:38.685 --> 08:41.645
we'd pick up the phone and find someone
at BCD to talk to on a Saturday.

08:41.730 --> 08:42.688
Once we did that...

08:42.772 --> 08:45.774
It would take about 10 seconds for BCD
to alert the Defense Department

08:45.859 --> 08:47.818
and the FBI would show up here in an hour.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.361
And they would take you in for questioning

08:49.446 --> 08:51.197
and not let you go
until you reveal your source.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.281
That's not gonna happen.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.283
Not gonna happen 'cause
we're not gonna run the story.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.785
We are gonna run the story
and I will avail myself

08:56.870 --> 08:59.872
of the protection the First Amendment gives
me when it comes to revealing a source.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.582
Neither the First nor any other
amendment protects you

09:01.666 --> 09:03.459
when you conspire to commit treason.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.212
Don't run the story
and you don't have to call BCD.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.380
Don't call BCD and nobody knows
you have the documents.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.549
Don't ever make contact
with your source again.

09:10.634 --> 09:14.094
A truth that matters can't stay hidden
and it's no more complicated than that.

09:14.179 --> 09:17.723
It's a lot more complicated than that,
and I decide what goes on the air.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.976
So, in point of fact,
we'll be doing exactly what Rebecca just said,

09:21.061 --> 09:22.937
which is to say nothing.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.207
Look at that.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.918
Is that a good enough score
to get me in the FBI?

09:46.002 --> 09:48.003
It's not a good enough score
to get you in the PTA.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.422
I put two shots right in the torso.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.842
Unfortunately, the other four hit
anyone standing next to the torso.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.845
Hey. Thanks.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.097
Thank you.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.186
That one's yours?

10:04.854 --> 10:07.022
It belongs to the Bureau, but, yeah.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.691
Tell me something.
Why don't they allow people

10:08.775 --> 10:10.276
to go in there alone?

10:10.360 --> 10:12.486
They don't want to make it
easier to commit suicide.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.698
So these are the good people with the guns

10:15.782 --> 10:17.866
who are going to stop
the bad people with the guns.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.910
- We're the good people with the guns.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.288
How's the wedding coming along?

10:22.372 --> 10:26.375
Be easier if people stopped
detonating bombs in Boston

10:26.459 --> 10:28.961
and factories stopped blowing up in Texas.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.671
I missed a fitting last week.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.548
- Casualty count keeps rising.

10:33.425 --> 10:36.302
-I need to ask you about something.
-I figured.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.637
-It'll be hypothetical.
-It needs to be.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.806
They give us a polygraph test every five years

10:40.890 --> 10:42.057
and mine's coming up.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.311
In today's climate,
what happens to a reporter

10:45.395 --> 10:48.188
who's made contact
with a government whistle-blower?

10:48.273 --> 10:50.482
-A leaker.
-A whistle-blower.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.444
A leaker of secrets
who has taken it upon himself

10:53.528 --> 10:55.571
to decide what laws to obey.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.324
A reporter might gain
the favor of the government

10:58.408 --> 11:02.036
by reporting such a leak to us
instead of the general public.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.705
That reporter's organization
would never have another source again.

11:04.789 --> 11:08.167
And one might say they'd abdicated
their responsibility to a democracy.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.918
Yeah, one might be full of shit, too.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.422
-Look, I...
-Nothing.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.175
The answer is nothing happens.

11:16.259 --> 11:19.178
No reporter's ever been prosecuted
under the Espionage Act.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.222
If they don't reveal their source,
they may be charged with contempt.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.683
And if they go to jail,
it's for an average of 10 days.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.101
At the most, it's been six months.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.146
- You sound disappointed, Molly.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.690
Sources come to us with things
they can't come to you with.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.859
Yeah, we have sources, too, Mac.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.944
We use them to stop
violent crimes before they happen.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.489
You want to protect your sources, so do we.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.741
'Cause when there's a leak,
our sources get executed.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.831
On most every occasion,
Obama refused to side

11:47.916 --> 11:50.334
with the EPA's more
science-based positions.

11:50.418 --> 11:53.545
I don't know, whether...
Whether it's cleaning up the air

11:53.630 --> 11:58.801
or forcing the national resources industries
to abide by existing regulations,

11:58.885 --> 12:04.390
ultimately the EPA is only as good
as the White House allows us to be.

12:04.474 --> 12:07.643
Okay, take the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.897
That was the largest oil spill
the US has experienced...

12:11.981 --> 12:14.274
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

12:14.359 --> 12:15.359
No.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.986
Shh. Don't be alarmed, okay?

12:18.321 --> 12:19.321
Okay.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.199
I need a favor and I'll be able to
explain why in just a few minutes,

12:22.283 --> 12:24.326
but for now you have to trust a stranger.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.577
What's the favor?

12:25.662 --> 12:27.704
Hold my iPod and put in the earbuds.

12:27.956 --> 12:28.997
In your ears?

12:29.666 --> 12:31.542
In your ears like you're listening to it.

12:31.626 --> 12:32.876
You still have an iPod?

12:32.961 --> 12:34.128
I like the way the wheel clicks.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.712
But that's not important right now.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.214
-Will you do it?
-Yeah, sure.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.425
Well, I can give it to you on the record

12:39.509 --> 12:42.302
-or I can give it to you off the record.
-Shh.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.263
On the record is gonna make you laugh.

12:44.347 --> 12:45.681
On the record?

12:45.765 --> 12:50.394
The President continues
to believe in a strong EPA

12:50.478 --> 12:54.857
led by an advocate for smart
pro-growth environmental policies

12:54.941 --> 12:55.941
that will protect...

12:56.025 --> 12:59.361
Okay, now you're laughing
just as I said you would be.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.655
Off the record...

13:01.739 --> 13:03.031
Hey, hang on.

13:10.665 --> 13:15.335
Off the record, even he'd admit
he couldn't get a law through this Congress

13:15.670 --> 13:17.880
reaffirming the US
as the name of the country.

13:17.964 --> 13:21.341
So why bother wasting
what little capital he has

13:21.426 --> 13:22.426
with the Republicans on the Hill

13:22.510 --> 13:26.847
trying to get an up or down vote on his pick
to run a toothless agency?

13:28.057 --> 13:29.057
Mmm.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.310
I was gonna get the buffet.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.104
I don't know why, if given a choice,
anyone wouldn't get the buffet.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.898
Under what circumstance
would you order off the menu?

13:35.982 --> 13:37.441
If the menu had a 5-pound lobster

13:37.525 --> 13:39.818
and the buffet was soy-themed,
all-you-can-eat assorted soy.

13:39.903 --> 13:40.903
Here's what I need you to do.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.237
Why does there need to be an assignment?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.114
Hey, are we in this buffet thing together?

13:44.199 --> 13:46.408
Yeah, we tell the waiter
we're getting the buffet.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.702
I did a Q&A in Shape about my healthy diet.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.913
-You lied.
-In a big way and I'm really hungry.

13:50.997 --> 13:51.997
So I need you to get food for me

13:52.081 --> 13:53.207
-and I'll get food for you.
-Got it.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.335
Crab claws as far as the eye can see.

13:56.419 --> 13:57.878
Mushroom and Swiss cheese omelet.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.755
And I can't emphasize this enough...

13:59.839 --> 14:00.839
Waffles.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.258
-And what am I getting?
-Fruit salad.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.136
-Have you decided yet?
-We're gonna have the buffet.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.262
I'm only having something light,

14:07.347 --> 14:08.805
but I'm gonna keep him company
at the buffet.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.266
I know it seems like a waste
paying for the buffet and not eating it,

14:11.351 --> 14:12.434
but that's what I'm gonna do.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.685
Okay.

14:13.770 --> 14:14.811
Help yourselves.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.231
I don't think he bought it.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.650
I think it was a more detailed explanation
than he's used to getting.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.781
Hey, I didn't tell you.
You made me $125 yesterday.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.865
How'd I do that?

14:26.950 --> 14:28.742
I bought $2,500 of Chipotle.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.911
Please tell me you're talking
about the hot sauce.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.956
-The stock, the company.
-You bought CMG?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.457
-You told me to.
-No, I didn't.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.751
You said,
"Chipotle's gonna have a good day."

14:37.835 --> 14:40.712
Because I got an advance copy of
the earnings report and anticipated an uptick.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.131
-Well, you were right.
-I know I was right.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.425
Wait, you went on TV
and told people to buy the stock.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.302
How was I at a greater advantage
than your viewers?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.972
When did you buy?
Before or after we went on the air.

14:51.641 --> 14:52.599
-Before.
-Before.

14:52.684 --> 14:55.394
-Did you buy at 352.88?
-I bought at 344.91.

14:55.478 --> 14:56.562
You bought it at its opening price,

14:56.646 --> 15:00.274
which is almost $8 a share lower
than it was when I went on the air.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.067
Congratulations, we're white-collar criminals.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.777
Okay, first let me say
if you're gonna be a criminal,

15:03.861 --> 15:04.945
that's probably the best kind to be.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.154
I don't want to be any kind.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.573
We have to go to the office after this for Neal.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.408
-Should we talk to Rebecca?
-I think we should.

15:12.495 --> 15:13.537
No!

15:14.080 --> 15:16.623
We're still gonna eat first.
Crab claws, right there.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.000
-And, Don.
-Yeah?

15:18.084 --> 15:19.418
You walked right past the waffles.

15:19.502 --> 15:20.544
I'm sorry.

15:41.691 --> 15:44.318
No way in the wide fucking
world we're doing this story.

15:47.989 --> 15:50.198
Hey. What are you doing here?

15:50.283 --> 15:51.867
What are you doing here?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.619
Came in to catch up on
the week's worth of news

15:53.703 --> 15:55.954
that happened during Boston.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.956
Jenna Bush had a baby.

15:58.041 --> 16:01.293
I wonder how many great-grandfather
presidents we've had.

16:01.377 --> 16:05.172
I fucked up so bad and it's all
gonna come down in the next hour.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.256
What are you talking about?

16:08.092 --> 16:09.134
Hallie, what are...

16:17.852 --> 16:18.852
Last night...

16:19.187 --> 16:21.355
This morning, around 2:00 a.m.,

16:21.439 --> 16:23.815
we were wrapping up the Boston coverage
and I was heading home

16:23.900 --> 16:26.902
and I saw that ACN hadn't posted a tweet
in six and a half hours.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.946
Neal usually does that
and he likes to post every 30 minutes,

16:30.031 --> 16:32.574
but I knew where his head was,
so I posted for him when I got home.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.036
That was 2:37 this morning.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.623
I went to sleep and then woke up
and deleted it a half hour later.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.833
-3:04.
-What was the tweet?

16:41.918 --> 16:42.918
-Nobody's picked it up yet.
-What was it?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.336
-I knew it was wrong the second I...
-Hal.

16:47.298 --> 16:50.050
I hit send and thought, "Well, that's done."
And turned the lights off.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.761
Republicans rejoice..."

16:56.641 --> 17:00.018
"Republicans rejoice
that there's finally a national tragedy

17:00.103 --> 17:01.478
"that doesn't involve guns."

17:12.782 --> 17:14.366
-It was up for how long?
-27 minutes.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.076
In the middle of the night on a night

17:16.160 --> 17:18.370
when everyone was
paying attention to something else.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.955
Is there any chance it won't be found?

17:20.331 --> 17:21.456
No.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.960
I came in to get fired.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.337
Reese, where did our stock close yesterday?

17:27.422 --> 17:28.755
66.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.925
And what's Savannah Capital
offering you per share?

17:32.009 --> 17:33.009
81.

17:33.094 --> 17:36.596
45% of the controlling shares

17:37.432 --> 17:40.559
times 66 equals...

17:40.643 --> 17:41.727
Carry the three.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.104
Times 81.

17:44.772 --> 17:45.731
All right.

17:45.815 --> 17:50.485
Right now your stock is worth $2.3 billion.

17:51.028 --> 17:54.698
Savannah Capital says
it should be worth $3.1 billion.

17:55.491 --> 17:59.494
Aren't $2.3 billion and $3.1 billion

17:59.579 --> 18:01.121
the exact same thing?

18:01.205 --> 18:02.205
What's the difference?

18:02.665 --> 18:04.291
800 million.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.918
Yes, good, Randy.
But I think what Charlie is saying is,

18:07.003 --> 18:10.756
what can you buy with 3.1 billion
that you can't buy with 2.3 billion?

18:10.840 --> 18:13.967
You seem to think our plan
is to hit the ATM and go shopping.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.886
-What is your plan?
-My immediate plan

18:15.970 --> 18:18.805
is to ask you why the fuck you think
we need to tell you our plan.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.433
We're not seeking permission for something.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.101
In 10 days, we turn 25,

18:23.186 --> 18:26.229
inherit 45% of the controlling shares of AWM,

18:26.314 --> 18:28.106
and sell them to Savannah Capital,

18:28.191 --> 18:30.609
who was able to buy 6%
of the controlling shares

18:30.693 --> 18:34.112
without any of the geniuses
at this company noticing.

18:34.197 --> 18:36.990
And do you know what I find
so perfectly poetic, Reese?

18:37.074 --> 18:41.745
Is that you would have been looking out for it
if you remembered when our birthday was.

18:41.829 --> 18:42.954
Or that we were born.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.874
People like you are the reason
people hate people like me.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.001
Guess that's why you didn't
sit with us at the funeral.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.253
Jesus Christ, my father had just died.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.881
I wasn't paying a lot of attention to
where my fucking seats were.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.090
-Reese.
-Can we not?

18:54.175 --> 18:55.634
-I got to tell you something.
-'Cause we're talking

18:55.718 --> 18:57.969
about 141,000 people.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.095
Dad thought you were an asshole.

19:01.224 --> 19:02.724
-All right. All right!
-I'm...

19:03.267 --> 19:04.351
All right.

19:04.727 --> 19:07.354
I want you to sit out
a couple of rounds. All right?

19:07.897 --> 19:10.148
-All right?
-Yeah.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.996
It's me now.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.332
As I understand it,
the criteria for running a story is,

19:27.416 --> 19:29.042
one, are we confident it's accurate,

19:29.126 --> 19:30.669
and two, is it in the public interest?

19:30.753 --> 19:32.003
And this passes those tests.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.797
You were confident Genoa was accurate.

19:33.881 --> 19:37.843
I have my own personal third criteria,
which is, "Will it land any of my guys in jail?"

19:37.927 --> 19:39.678
- That's not...
- This passes that test, too.

19:39.762 --> 19:44.516
By the way, in order to ascertain its accuracy,
we'd have to pick up the phone and call BCD,

19:44.600 --> 19:46.977
which is the trip wire that sends in the FBI.

19:47.061 --> 19:50.522
Now hand over the flash drive
so I can crush it with a meat tenderizer.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.275
-What's he crushing with a meat tenderizer?
-Truth. Hope.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.442
Journalistic integrity.

19:54.569 --> 19:57.279
Hey, I've got more journalistic integrity
in my whole body

19:57.363 --> 19:59.239
-than you've got in your...
-You've got that turned around.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.992
You've got more journalistic integrity
in your whole body...

20:02.076 --> 20:03.702
-That's still wrong.
-What the fuck am I trying to say?

20:03.786 --> 20:05.745
-That you're a pussy.
-Watch your mouth, Mandela.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.873
I'd be a pussy if I was afraid of going to jail.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.541
In fact, that wouldn't even make me a pussy.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.626
Other people have gone to jail
for refusing to give up a source.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.211
I'd consider it a badge of honor.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.380
Oh, be sure to show your badge
to your roommates when you get there.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.258
Neal, it is not refusing to give up
a source that we're talking about.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.593
That's a contempt charge.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.094
It is espionage.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.470
-No, it's not.
-Along with a Christmas list

20:22.555 --> 20:24.389
of other felonies...

20:24.473 --> 20:26.474
-Why?
-I've just come from talking to a friend.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.101
She's been with the FBI 15 years.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.269
Unimpeachable source.

20:29.353 --> 20:32.063
This is her area and she says
they'd never charge him with espionage.

20:32.315 --> 20:33.732
This woman does not know
what she's talking about.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.150
Yeah, she does.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.569
No journalist has ever
been charged with espionage.

20:37.653 --> 20:38.820
She says it'll be contempt.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.156
They would charge him with
kidnapping the Lindbergh baby

20:41.240 --> 20:42.657
if they think it'll get them to the leak.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.910
- 30 days.
- She says more like 10.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.036
10 days.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.496
That's one day for every
three and a half people we killed

20:48.581 --> 20:50.874
by knowingly planting a false story
in a foreign newspaper.

20:50.958 --> 20:51.958
You did the division that fast?

20:52.043 --> 20:53.835
Yeah, cliché buster. I'm good at math.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.962
Please tell me you're not softening
your position on this?

20:56.047 --> 20:58.423
-My position hasn't softened at all.
-Smartest person in the room.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.383
There's no question we have to do the story.

21:00.468 --> 21:01.760
She is an idiot savant.

21:01.844 --> 21:03.970
-When did you change your mind?
-I didn't change my mind.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.097
I've known we had to do the story
the second he showed it to us.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.266
Do you remember last night?
It was last night.

21:08.351 --> 21:09.935
-I do remember last night.
-You went on and on

21:10.019 --> 21:12.270
about how we have to protect
Neal because we're family.

21:12.355 --> 21:13.396
That was you.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.191
You didn't push back.
I interpreted that as agreeing with me.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.734
You should have interpreted that

21:17.818 --> 21:19.486
as we just finished five days
of covering Boston,

21:19.570 --> 21:22.364
it was late, I was tired, and I was sleeping.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.325
How often are you sleeping
when I'm talking to you at night?

21:25.409 --> 21:27.035
I'd really have no way of knowing that.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.620
The two lawyers in the room say no.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.288
The two journalists in the room say yes.

21:30.373 --> 21:31.873
There are three journalists.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.124
Did I count that wrong?

21:33.209 --> 21:35.669
If you think being an ass is gonna
make me less inclined to protect you,

21:35.753 --> 21:36.795
think again, mofo.

21:36.879 --> 21:39.047
I can out-ass anyone
in the in the Tri-State Area.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.298
He's telling the truth, Neal.

21:40.383 --> 21:42.592
You know, it feels like
you're on my side, but just barely.

21:42.677 --> 21:44.010
-Jenna!
-You make that poor girl

21:44.095 --> 21:46.638
-work on a Saturday?
-She's a recent journalism school graduate.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.264
I'm just completing her education.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.392
What she's learning from me
can't be found in books.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.060
-Yes?
-I'd like a Dr Pepper, please.

21:52.186 --> 21:53.269
- Sure.
- Billy.

21:53.354 --> 21:54.354
- What?
- Listen to me.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.064
-I am.
-We're doing this because we have to.

21:56.357 --> 21:58.149
All right, me and you. You want to go?

21:58.442 --> 21:59.609
You already know you're gonna lose.

21:59.694 --> 22:00.694
Take the first swing!

22:00.778 --> 22:03.822
The possibility that reporters
are gonna make bad behavior public

22:03.906 --> 22:06.408
is what stops people from behaving badly.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.828
The possibility of jail is supposed to be
what makes people stop behaving badly.

22:09.912 --> 22:13.081
Well, it hasn't 'cause they're still doing it
and they're gonna keep doing it.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.667
A PR company killed 38 people.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.920
We do nothing, and the 39th is on us.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.589
Game over. Let's make the phone call.

22:22.216 --> 22:23.591
Not so fast.

22:25.219 --> 22:27.846
And it'll just mean everybody
gets what they want,

22:27.930 --> 22:29.848
which is a rudderless EPA.

22:29.932 --> 22:33.351
I can't do what Congress will never do,

22:33.436 --> 22:35.478
which is regulate climate pollution.

22:35.563 --> 22:39.107
It's why so many Democrats
think he's jaw-droppingly weak.

22:39.734 --> 22:42.610
Yeah. All right. Yeah.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.040
-Excuse me, Mr. Westbrook?
-Yeah.

22:55.958 --> 22:58.168
-Do we know each other?
-You're Richard Westbrook,

22:58.252 --> 23:01.046
Deputy Assistant Administrator of the EPA?

23:01.130 --> 23:03.631
-I am.
-I heard your end of the call.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.050
-You did?
-Yes.

23:05.134 --> 23:08.845
I have more bad news.
I'm a producer with ACN. Maggie Jordan.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.473
How much of the call did you hear?

23:11.724 --> 23:15.894
I heard you say that the President's pick
to run the EPA will never get a vote,

23:15.978 --> 23:18.521
-that the EPA is a toothless agency...
-Jesus.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.190
...and that the President's
jaw-droppingly weak.

23:20.274 --> 23:25.945
No, I said Democrats think
the President's jaw-droppingly weak.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.948
Wait. That's not better.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.658
I was wondering if you'd like
to comment further.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.620
This car is half empty.

23:33.704 --> 23:35.371
I looked around.

23:35.456 --> 23:38.792
I didn't see anyone near me
except that guy with the headphones.

23:38.876 --> 23:41.503
-I was sitting right here.
-Why didn't I see you?

23:41.587 --> 23:44.297
I may have slid down in my seat.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.258
-What did you say your name was?
-Maggie Jordan.

23:47.343 --> 23:48.802
Well, that sucks, Maggie Jordan.

23:48.886 --> 23:52.180
You're on a train, Richard. You don't have
a reasonable expectation of privacy.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.307
What's more,
you were talking to another reporter.

23:54.391 --> 23:57.644
I was talking to a reporter I know and trust.

23:57.728 --> 24:00.522
-And I was off the record.
-You were off the record to him, not to me.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.856
You were hiding like...

24:01.941 --> 24:03.691
Why not make the call
from between the cars?

24:03.776 --> 24:06.361
-It's too loud!
-Why not wait till we get back to New York?

24:06.445 --> 24:08.113
Because this guy's on deadline now

24:08.197 --> 24:10.448
and I wanted to give him
background on a story

24:10.533 --> 24:12.492
that will hopefully put pressure on...

24:14.286 --> 24:16.329
Look, I work at the EPA, okay?

24:16.413 --> 24:19.124
We're staffed by seven people
and a high school intern.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.459
We don't care who's in the White House.

24:21.544 --> 24:23.628
We are pro-drinkable water and breathable air.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.880
We are anti the world coming to an end.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.925
But you're also public officials
and what you have to say about

24:29.009 --> 24:31.803
how a president's overseeing
your agency is relevant.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.931
-My job...
-Your job? Your job.

24:35.015 --> 24:39.310
If I hear one more gossip columnist
use democracy as a fig leaf,

24:39.395 --> 24:41.813
I'm gonna eat an IBM Selectric.

24:44.024 --> 24:46.651
-It's an old-fashioned...
-I know what an IBM Selectric is.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.987
And I should tell you
you've been on the record this whole time.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.321
-How?
-You didn't say...

24:50.406 --> 24:52.115
I didn't say I was off the record.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.366
I didn't call time-out.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.243
I took my foot off the base.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.871
Look, Richard, there's news
happening right in front of me.

24:57.955 --> 24:59.914
-It's my job...
-Don't.

25:00.583 --> 25:03.334
It's my responsibility, okay, to report it.

25:03.419 --> 25:07.839
Yeah, but you're not interested
in the news part of the news.

25:07.923 --> 25:10.967
I'd be happy to give you an interview
about the news part of the news.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.636
You like the unguarded moments,

25:13.721 --> 25:17.432
private behavior that can
never stand up to public scrutiny.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.808
But you didn't tell the truth

25:18.893 --> 25:22.020
until you were off the record
with the guy on the other end of the phone.

25:22.104 --> 25:24.355
The unguarded moments
are where the truth is.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.733
I don't care. I get to be guarded if I want.

25:26.817 --> 25:29.777
And you were slumped down in a chair.
How honest was that?

25:35.910 --> 25:37.994
Yeah.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.787
You're right.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.293
-What?
-You're right.

25:46.337 --> 25:47.337
What do you mean?

25:47.463 --> 25:49.047
That part was wrong.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.175
- Is this a trick?
- No.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.511
I'm deleting my notes. I apologize, Richard.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.805
And good luck. Here's my card,

25:58.599 --> 26:02.310
if you ever want to talk on the record,
which I strongly encourage you to do.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.479
Enjoy the rest of your trip.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.446
I don't understand what's happening now.

26:13.781 --> 26:15.365
Crab claw.

26:15.449 --> 26:16.491
Keep it low.

26:18.994 --> 26:23.706
It says here in the ACN employee's guide,
which has some interesting information

26:23.791 --> 26:25.750
I definitely should've read
before drinking beer with Jim, Neal,

26:25.834 --> 26:27.961
and some college kids in my office,
that we'd only be in trouble

26:28.045 --> 26:30.129
if I was a producer of financial news. I'm not.

26:30.214 --> 26:32.799
I produce the 10:00 hour,
which you occasionally host.

26:32.883 --> 26:35.718
-Keep reading.
-Employees are barred from... Blah blah...

26:35.803 --> 26:37.095
In accordance with the SEC...

26:37.221 --> 26:38.221
Blah blah...

26:38.931 --> 26:41.140
Married, engaged to be married, cohabitating

26:41.225 --> 26:43.351
or in what could reasonably
be considered a relationship

26:43.435 --> 26:45.061
where the two parties...

26:45.145 --> 26:47.313
The SEC will notice a pattern in your trading.

26:47.398 --> 26:49.732
That you appear to be
front-running news for ACN.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.025
And they will connect you to me.

26:51.193 --> 26:53.444
-And even if they don't...
-We're a couple?

26:55.030 --> 26:56.030
Mmm?

26:56.282 --> 26:57.490
You consider us a couple?

26:58.367 --> 26:59.701
I don't understand that question.

27:00.202 --> 27:03.079
Yeah, you do, 'cause this is exactly
how I act in the same situation.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.956
Suddenly I pretend I'm stupid
and hearing impaired.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.542
-Do you consider us a couple?
-Do you consider us a couple?

27:07.626 --> 27:08.668
I do that, too, Socrates.

27:09.378 --> 27:10.920
We are...

27:11.005 --> 27:12.630
-Yep.
-Okay, let me say...

27:12.715 --> 27:13.798
Go ahead.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.008
-Here's what we are.
-Bring it.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.135
-I love spending time with you.
-Oh!

27:17.219 --> 27:18.219
-Oh, man.
-Wait.

27:18.345 --> 27:19.846
I can't believe I'm getting Don Keefered.

27:19.930 --> 27:21.014
You're not.

27:21.265 --> 27:23.224
I would never Don Keefer you.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.685
We're a couple. Totally.
Of course we're a couple.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.103
Let me remind you,
I was the one who had a problem

27:27.187 --> 27:28.479
with you trading Chipotle. Why?

27:28.564 --> 27:30.189
Because we're a couple.

27:30.274 --> 27:32.650
You're the one buying up Chipotle
hither and yon as if,

27:32.735 --> 27:35.028
"Duh. Look, I don't produce a financial show."

27:36.155 --> 27:37.572
-See what I mean?
-Okay.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.909
Got to slide me a waffle, man.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.207
I'll address that aggressive behavior
in just a moment.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.209
<i>He looked up, you see?</i>

27:50.336 --> 27:52.503
He saw that the pitcher
wasn't covering first base,

27:52.588 --> 27:55.465
which is what the pitcher is
supposed to do on a ground ball to first.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.008
They've known that since Little League.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.843
He looked up,
and you can see it on the replay.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.304
He looks up because he knew
the pitcher wasn't covering the bag

28:01.388 --> 28:03.931
and he needed to gauge
his position relative to the base.

28:04.933 --> 28:07.143
What happens when you take
your eye off the ball?

28:07.227 --> 28:10.897
God, Jim, what in the name of
sweet Christ are you talking about?

28:10.981 --> 28:13.024
-Bill Buckner.
-Is this the best time, babe?

28:13.108 --> 28:14.734
I thought it might be a welcome distraction.

28:14.818 --> 28:15.860
It's an unwelcome annoyance.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.529
I knew going in that was a possibility.

28:18.614 --> 28:20.239
Buckner needs to be exonerated.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.617
You make one mistake and...

28:38.467 --> 28:42.553
CNN represents a small fraction
of Time Warner's revenue.

28:42.638 --> 28:46.224
NBC Nightly News
a small fraction of Comcast.

28:46.308 --> 28:49.394
And ACN an even smaller fraction of Atlantis.

28:49.478 --> 28:53.272
But they are the face and voice
of their parent corporations.

28:53.357 --> 28:54.982
- So what?
- So what?

28:55.275 --> 28:56.484
Yes.

28:58.737 --> 28:59.987
That's a fair question.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.406
I think you're making good headway.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.825
-As an experienced negotiator...
-Reese Lansing.

29:03.909 --> 29:09.163
As the president of a news network,
all I do every day is fight with him.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.916
All I do every day is fight with Leona.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.584
And the thing of it is this,

29:13.669 --> 29:16.504
I win almost every one of those battles.

29:16.588 --> 29:20.007
What network president can say that
about their corporate parent?

29:20.092 --> 29:23.594
I win almost every one
of those battles and the reason is,

29:23.679 --> 29:26.013
most of the time they let me.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.975
Your father absolutely
did not think you were an asshole.

29:29.268 --> 29:32.353
They want ACN to do the news well.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.480
And we're not always successful at it,

29:34.565 --> 29:36.774
but that's what we try to do,
and they let me win

29:36.859 --> 29:40.069
- because they just want us to play our role.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.821
As a public service.

29:41.905 --> 29:44.073
As a patriotic sacrifice.

29:44.158 --> 29:45.575
As a moral imperative,

29:45.659 --> 29:48.619
they do not require ACN to make money.

29:48.745 --> 29:51.456
Why? Because they can afford it.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.458
-Charlie.
-Isn't that something you want to be a part of

29:53.542 --> 29:55.460
and not something you want to end?

29:55.544 --> 29:58.171
Don't you want to be handed the baton?

29:59.214 --> 30:01.549
We want to strike out on our own.

30:01.633 --> 30:02.925
Be entrepreneurs.

30:03.010 --> 30:06.512
-Maybe get into Bitcoin.
-Shut the fuck up, Randy.

30:08.098 --> 30:09.474
Go deal with it.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.436
This is so fucked up,
I don't even know where to begin.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.313
-Yeah.
-Jesus Christ!

30:15.397 --> 30:16.564
She understands it's fucked up.

30:16.648 --> 30:21.319
The RNC wants a public apology
or we can't book Republicans on any show.

30:21.403 --> 30:23.988
-An entire political party.
-They deserve a public apology.

30:24.072 --> 30:27.116
It's almost six months to the day
since our last public apology.

30:27.201 --> 30:28.951
There is no question
that your anger is founded.

30:29.453 --> 30:30.912
I wasn't questioning it, Jim.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.164
I'm not on the fence about
whether I should be angry.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.208
I'd like to say the following
in Hallie's defense.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.251
Like everybody,
she was incredibly tired last night...

30:37.336 --> 30:38.669
That's just lame!

30:38.754 --> 30:40.254
This wasn't something
she would normally do.

30:40.422 --> 30:42.298
She deleted it. She knew it was wrong.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.509
Are you two together?

30:44.593 --> 30:45.760
We met on the Romney campaign.

30:46.261 --> 30:49.555
But that is not why she got the job.
She has done great work for ACN Digital.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.140
Read her last 10 columns, look at her...

30:51.266 --> 30:53.684
Uh, I don't care if she wrote
the collective works of Tolstoy.

30:53.769 --> 30:55.061
She also wrote this.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.608
I'm not gonna make you fire her.

31:01.235 --> 31:02.443
-Thank you.
-No, I'm sorry.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.362
I meant I'm going to do it.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.241
If your mind is made up...

31:08.325 --> 31:11.202
I don't get to make up my own mind now.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.912
The RNC is doing it for me.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.873
If your mind is made up,
then it's my job to fire her.

31:15.958 --> 31:17.083
What?

31:17.167 --> 31:19.460
Excuse me. Sorry. I think this is about me.

31:19.545 --> 31:20.586
Come in.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.881
We haven't really met. I'm Charlie Skinner.

31:23.966 --> 31:25.007
I know.

31:25.092 --> 31:26.801
Republicans are rejoicing?

31:26.885 --> 31:30.596
You know 144 people got blown up, right?

31:30.681 --> 31:32.974
And that three of those people are dead.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.017
And that one of them
is eight years fucking old.

31:35.102 --> 31:36.435
Yes, sir.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.354
I'm so curious, I have to ask.

31:38.438 --> 31:41.607
At the time when you typed it, in that moment,

31:41.692 --> 31:44.151
what were you thinking the value of it was?

31:44.653 --> 31:46.070
Retweets.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.368
I appreciate your honesty.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.372
You should know Jim
did everything he could for you.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.917
We'll say it was a low-level staffer
and they were fired,

32:00.002 --> 32:01.794
but we won't reveal your name.

32:02.212 --> 32:04.338
-Thank you.
-That's all.

32:12.848 --> 32:14.515
-Can I?
-Yeah.

32:25.736 --> 32:26.861
You're a reporter?

32:27.821 --> 32:29.905
-I'm sorry?
-You're a reporter?

32:30.574 --> 32:32.742
A news producer. ACN.

32:32.826 --> 32:34.368
You were in Boston for the bombing?

32:35.704 --> 32:36.871
I was there for the race.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.581
You're okay?

32:38.665 --> 32:40.958
I finished about a half hour
before the explosion.

32:41.543 --> 32:42.793
Good thing you're fast.

32:43.170 --> 32:44.170
Um...

32:44.546 --> 32:47.965
Before, with that guy from the EPA,
you were on solid ground.

32:48.050 --> 32:51.010
In Massachusetts it's illegal to record
anybody without two-party consent.

32:51.094 --> 32:54.472
But two things. One, you are protected
by the First Amendment.

32:54.556 --> 32:57.058
And two, you were in Connecticut at the time.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.185
Yeah.

32:59.269 --> 33:01.479
I think I was okay journalistically,

33:01.563 --> 33:04.023
and I'm pretty sure I was okay legally.

33:04.107 --> 33:07.318
I'm just not sure I was airtight morally.

33:07.527 --> 33:08.819
How did you hear us?

33:08.904 --> 33:10.404
I wasn't listening to music.

33:12.407 --> 33:13.491
What do you do?

33:13.575 --> 33:15.868
I teach. Fordham Law School.

33:15.952 --> 33:19.413
You're pretty young for a law professor.
What do you teach?

33:19.498 --> 33:21.165
-Ethics.
-Get out of town.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.125
I'm trying. I'm on an express train.

33:24.753 --> 33:25.920
Excuse me.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.755
-Hi.
-Hi. Could I...

33:28.924 --> 33:30.883
Speak with you a second?

33:30.967 --> 33:32.259
-Sure.
-Yeah.

33:38.934 --> 33:40.226
I spoke to our counsel,

33:40.310 --> 33:42.895
and she says there's nothing
stopping you from running the story.

33:42.979 --> 33:45.106
I'm not doing anything with the story.

33:45.607 --> 33:47.358
Our counsel says
there's nothing stopping you.

33:47.442 --> 33:50.528
If you want to speak to me on the record,
I'm happy to listen,

33:50.612 --> 33:53.239
but I'm not taking what I overheard
to my senior producer.

33:54.908 --> 33:59.203
I am willing to trade you another story

33:59.287 --> 34:03.749
for the promise that you won't use
my candid remarks about the President.

34:03.834 --> 34:07.211
I have no intention
of using your candid remarks

34:07.295 --> 34:11.090
or even your on-the-record remarks
which were meant for someone else.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.802
I just don't understand.

34:17.264 --> 34:20.099
I don't know how to make it
any clearer than that.

34:20.892 --> 34:21.934
Good luck.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.818
I think you're freaking him out.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.115
How's your boss gonna feel about
you passing on a story?

34:36.199 --> 34:38.159
And then another story?

34:39.327 --> 34:40.911
Whatever the second story is,

34:40.996 --> 34:43.831
I'm not going to blackmail him
into giving it to me.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.626
You can save your students a lot of time.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.254
On the first day of class,

34:50.338 --> 34:53.841
tell them they know the difference
between right and wrong.

34:53.925 --> 34:54.925
Do what's right.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.762
They don't need a lawyer
to tell them their moral absolutes.

34:57.846 --> 35:01.015
And whenever you hear
someone giving a monologue

35:01.099 --> 35:02.516
defending the ethics of their position,

35:02.601 --> 35:04.643
you can be pretty sure
they know they were wrong.

35:04.728 --> 35:06.479
Can I point something out to you?

35:06.563 --> 35:07.688
You're giving a monologue.

35:08.190 --> 35:09.815
Everyone does where I work.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.112
You know what Vipassana is?

35:15.197 --> 35:16.614
It's a small Italian motorbike.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.200
-Not a Vespa. Vipassana.
-I know what Vipassana is.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.786
It's a meditation retreat in India
where you don't talk for a week.

35:21.870 --> 35:24.288
-But feel free to tell me anyway.
-Maybe two weeks.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.373
-Think I'm gonna do it.
-You should.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.876
You seem tense.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.711
You got that backwards, money honey.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.756
No, I'm only a little tense because of
what's happening at the office right now.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.841
-Okay.
-All right.

35:36.593 --> 35:39.970
Hey, it's my parents' 40th anniversary
and the week after next there's a party.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.055
Do you wanna come?

35:42.766 --> 35:44.642
Absolutely, I do, but here's the thing.

35:44.726 --> 35:47.269
-You might be on Vipassana?
-Or maybe a Yamaha.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.230
Big laugh from the crowd.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.690
All right, let's just...
Now we're meeting parents?

35:51.775 --> 35:53.150
And it all started with a stock trade.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.486
You see how things spiral out of control?
They spiral.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.531
Just buy mutual funds.
There's nothing wrong with mutual funds.

35:58.615 --> 36:00.407
I feel like I'm being tested right now.

36:01.827 --> 36:02.993
That's it? You're leaving?

36:03.078 --> 36:04.078
Wait.

36:06.581 --> 36:07.790
I'm hailing a cab.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.001
All right. Close one.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.127
Yeah.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.005
Yours is an unusual position
for a reporter.

36:15.090 --> 36:18.634
Who decides what's private and
what's information people should know?

36:18.718 --> 36:20.511
In the airspace right around me,

36:20.595 --> 36:21.595
I do.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.185
-Hi.
-I'm not scamming you, Richard.

36:28.270 --> 36:30.396
I know. Can I have a word?

36:30.480 --> 36:31.480
-Sure.
-Yeah.

36:38.822 --> 36:41.240
This report won't be released for a week.

36:41.324 --> 36:43.659
The White House got it today,
but they won't show it to the President

36:43.743 --> 36:45.119
until at least Monday.

36:46.746 --> 36:49.665
It's yours, along with an exclusive interview.

36:50.792 --> 36:51.959
What's in it?

36:53.378 --> 36:58.549
The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
has passed a long-feared milestone.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.467
The amount of poison gas
in the air hasn't been this high

37:00.552 --> 37:02.261
in three million years,
since before there were humans.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.139
-We get the report?
-You get the report.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.558
Embargoed until Monday.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.518
And an exclusive interview.

37:09.603 --> 37:11.061
-With who?
-Me.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.939
Any chance we can get the administrator?

37:14.524 --> 37:16.692
There hasn't been an administrator

37:16.776 --> 37:18.736
of the Environmental
Protection Agency for a while

37:18.820 --> 37:21.280
because Senate Republicans
won't confirm one

37:21.364 --> 37:23.949
and the President doesn't want
to waste political capital.

37:24.034 --> 37:27.161
Though I'm not sure
what he's saving it up for.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.206
- That statement was on the record.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.542
Nice meeting you.

37:34.002 --> 37:37.630
Richard, be careful when
you're talking out loud in public.

37:38.131 --> 37:39.173
I was careful.

37:39.257 --> 37:42.051
Okay, but you just told
a train car full of people

37:42.135 --> 37:43.844
-that the apocalypse is nigh.
-Damn it.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.596
It's all right. Nobody's listening.

37:46.181 --> 37:47.348
Tell me about it.

37:50.018 --> 37:51.435
It was nice meeting you, Jack.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.145
I've got to get my bag.

37:53.229 --> 37:54.396
- Isn't that your bag?

37:54.814 --> 37:58.150
This is a month's rent for me.
It's my executive producer's.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.401
I don't know your name.

37:59.861 --> 38:01.028
Maggie Jordan.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.613
I'd love to call you.

38:05.742 --> 38:07.576
-Here's my card.
-Great.

38:11.456 --> 38:14.667
And, Jack, I've got a report here from the EPA

38:14.751 --> 38:16.543
that says you probably
shouldn't wait that long.

38:19.381 --> 38:21.632
And the government's complicity was covert,

38:21.716 --> 38:24.468
robbing the citizens in a democracy
of the information they need

38:24.552 --> 38:27.012
if they're going to have
an intelligent debate about foreign policy.

38:27.097 --> 38:29.765
Covert ops are why you don't hear much
about the Mafia anymore.

38:29.849 --> 38:31.809
Covert ops are why your parents are alive.

38:31.893 --> 38:34.853
They're why there are fewer
nuclear scientists alive in Iran.

38:34.938 --> 38:36.981
Covert ops are what's forcing al-Qaeda...

38:37.065 --> 38:41.276
Covert ops were behind Iran-Contra
and it was the press who exposed it.

38:41.361 --> 38:43.904
Covert ops got money
and equipment and training

38:43.989 --> 38:46.573
to the mujahedeen
after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.410
The press not knowing about it
is how communism fell in Europe.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.537
-I can go all day long.
-God knows.

38:51.621 --> 38:52.746
Excuse me.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.207
- Where are you going?
- The men's room.

38:55.291 --> 38:58.335
- Neal, leave behind the drive.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.007
Are you serious?

39:03.425 --> 39:06.176
Well, you're hotheaded right now.

39:06.261 --> 39:08.429
Leave the flash drive on the table.

39:17.439 --> 39:19.106
It's locked in a filing cabinet under my desk.

39:22.277 --> 39:23.485
Are you getting my point?

39:23.611 --> 39:26.363
Yeah, you don't want Neal to go to jail
for 10 days and neither do I.

39:26.448 --> 39:28.032
But these are the rules of cribbage.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.200
I could swallow this key, you know.

39:30.285 --> 39:32.327
Yeah, 'cause what criminal mastermind

39:32.412 --> 39:35.456
could open an Office Depot
filing cabinet without a key?

39:36.916 --> 39:38.667
You're thinking of different ways

39:38.752 --> 39:39.918
-to murder me right now.
-Mmm-hmm.

39:47.469 --> 39:48.886
<i>New York Observer.</i>

39:48.970 --> 39:50.220
How did word get out this fast?

39:50.430 --> 39:52.139
Fast is the speed at which word travels.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.599
It's been blowing up for an hour.

39:53.683 --> 39:55.726
Yeah, but I saw Charlie's
statement and apology.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.561
He kept his promise. He didn't name anyone.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.313
I did. I outed myself on Twitter.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.898
My account, not the network.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.276
"Just left ACN for the last time.
Great five weeks.

40:04.360 --> 40:07.738
"Honest people.
Sensational experience. One regret.

40:07.822 --> 40:11.033
"I tweeted a terrible joke on
the network's account. No one else involved."

40:11.493 --> 40:14.161
Least I could do was make sure
no one thought it was someone else.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.829
You're gonna get plenty of job offers.

40:16.331 --> 40:18.373
I'm not worried. I'm embarrassed.

40:18.458 --> 40:21.460
No one who knows you thinks
you have anything to be embarrassed about.

40:21.544 --> 40:24.088
There's a pretty strong consensus
among people who don't know me

40:24.172 --> 40:26.715
that I'm a "stupid fucking libtard whore

40:26.800 --> 40:29.134
"who should have been
dismembered on Boylston Street

40:29.219 --> 40:31.720
"after first getting sodomized by a jihadist."

40:32.388 --> 40:34.515
Pretty mild for the Internet, but still...

40:39.229 --> 40:40.771
I appreciate...

40:41.981 --> 40:45.442
Charlie said that you did
everything you could to help me.

40:45.527 --> 40:46.568
Yeah.

40:46.903 --> 40:48.445
And he knew we were dating.

40:48.530 --> 40:50.989
So he said he'd do it himself,
which was merciful.

40:52.158 --> 40:53.450
Are you saying you volunteered to fire me?

40:53.535 --> 40:55.410
I wasn't volunteering. It was my job.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.706
<i>Daily Beast.</i>

41:00.041 --> 41:02.501
Some of the offers are gonna be
from people who don't like us very much.

41:02.585 --> 41:03.752
Who doesn't like us?

41:04.712 --> 41:07.172
Not you and me. ACN.
For some of the outlets,

41:07.257 --> 41:09.633
being someone with an ax to grind
against us would be an asset.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.593
I don't have an ax to grind.

41:14.931 --> 41:16.640
Do you think that's the reason I outed myself?

41:16.724 --> 41:18.725
Do I think... No.

41:18.810 --> 41:19.810
I was trying to do the right thing.

41:19.894 --> 41:22.187
-You think I put it out there as bait?
-I'm saying don't get played.

41:28.570 --> 41:29.570
<i>Gawker.</i>

41:38.329 --> 41:40.998
I needed a minute to adjust.
That's all that happened.

41:41.082 --> 41:43.792
I'd love to go to your parents'
40th anniversary party.

41:43.877 --> 41:45.711
There is no party. I was testing you.

41:46.671 --> 41:48.547
Are you for real?

41:48.631 --> 41:51.258
You did the exact same thing I did
when Maggie asked me to meet her parents.

41:53.887 --> 41:55.512
You gave me a little test.

41:56.639 --> 41:58.390
You didn't do well.

41:58.474 --> 42:01.685
Is this something you read in Cosmo
while you were at the dentist?

42:01.769 --> 42:02.769
Yes.

42:02.854 --> 42:06.982
I said I'd go to the party which doesn't exist
because you're a lying liar who lies a lot.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.567
It said the next thing you'd do is deflect.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.861
Don't you like having a gal pal
that you can hang out with

42:10.945 --> 42:12.821
where there are extra benefits like stock tips?

42:12.906 --> 42:15.365
-I can't use the stock tips.
-Then how about the sex?

42:25.627 --> 42:27.127
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.296
-Hey.
-Hi.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.599
-It would take a long time to explain...
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

42:54.030 --> 42:55.405
-Yes.
-Yes what?

42:55.490 --> 42:58.450
Yes, I love having a gal pal
with no commitment and tons of sex.

42:58.534 --> 42:59.910
-Great.
-Just not you.

42:59.994 --> 43:02.454
-What's wrong with me?
-Plenty, but I really like you anyway.

43:04.290 --> 43:05.749
I'm not good at not being alone.

43:05.833 --> 43:06.875
It's what I'm used to.

43:08.461 --> 43:10.003
Let me know if you want to get good at it.

43:14.509 --> 43:16.677
- The sex is good.
- Thank you.

43:17.512 --> 43:20.931
Invoking Leona Lansing
is gonna get you nowhere with me.

43:21.015 --> 43:22.766
Our fidelity is to our father's legacy,

43:22.850 --> 43:23.850
not his mother's.

43:23.977 --> 43:26.019
Then I can tell you this is not
what he would have wanted.

43:26.104 --> 43:27.771
-Then fuck him, too, Charlie.
-Hey!

43:27.855 --> 43:29.439
-All right.
-Why didn't our mother get shares?

43:29.524 --> 43:32.818
'Cause she's not the one that raised $42,350.

43:32.902 --> 43:34.528
She didn't build the company, she married it.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.029
Yeah, and like you poured the cement.

43:36.114 --> 43:37.781
As a matter of fact, with an MBA,

43:37.865 --> 43:39.866
he insisted on starting in the mail room.

43:39.951 --> 43:43.453
I understand we were born on third base,
but I'm stealing home now.

43:43.538 --> 43:45.706
-So that's about it.
-Shh.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.667
I'm not here.
I don't want to interrupt anything.

43:49.961 --> 43:51.086
Good afternoon, Leona.

43:51.504 --> 43:52.713
I'll tell you what.

43:52.797 --> 43:54.548
Leona is for friends and family.

43:54.632 --> 43:57.718
If you're trying to poach my company,
I'd prefer Mrs. Lansing.

44:00.305 --> 44:04.308
Oh, Blair, you get more beautiful
every time I see you.

44:04.392 --> 44:07.394
-How often is that?
-As infrequently as possible.

44:08.313 --> 44:10.814
I understand you've been
out on a date with Savannah Capital.

44:10.898 --> 44:12.357
And I let them take turns.

44:12.442 --> 44:15.110
And Randy, you like to watch, right?

44:15.820 --> 44:16.903
What?

44:17.947 --> 44:20.615
You know what happened last month
without anybody noticing?

44:20.700 --> 44:21.908
This is for real.

44:21.993 --> 44:26.288
Webster's Dictionary expanded
the definition of the word "literally"

44:26.372 --> 44:28.790
to include the way it's commonly misused.

44:28.875 --> 44:31.668
So the thing is, we no longer
have a word in the English language

44:31.753 --> 44:32.753
that means literally.

44:32.879 --> 44:34.796
I mean, literally doesn't have a synonym.

44:34.881 --> 44:37.382
So we're going to have to find
the Latin word for it and use it.

44:37.467 --> 44:39.176
But, see, I don't know any Latin.

44:39.260 --> 44:43.680
So when I say that I am literally gonna
set fire to this building with you in it

44:43.765 --> 44:45.891
before I hand over the keys to it,

44:45.975 --> 44:48.727
you don't know if I'm speaking
figuratively or literally.

44:49.270 --> 44:51.355
Savannah's offering $81 per share,

44:51.773 --> 44:54.608
so if this is about money,
you'll accept 82 from me, right?

44:54.692 --> 44:56.735
-Mom.
-We're not interested in selling 6%.

44:56.819 --> 44:59.780
I'm not interested in buying 6%!

44:59.864 --> 45:02.407
I don't want you anywhere near this company.

45:02.492 --> 45:03.492
I want all of it.

45:05.078 --> 45:08.663
I am offering you one full dollar per share
more than Savannah.

45:08.790 --> 45:10.916
So if this is about the money, you'll take it.

45:12.377 --> 45:13.585
$2.

45:15.755 --> 45:17.547
That's what I thought.

45:17.632 --> 45:20.717
I'll raise the cash and have an offer sheet
to you before your birthday.

45:21.636 --> 45:22.886
I tend to doubt it, but...

45:22.970 --> 45:25.764
Oh, get the fuck out of my boardroom, kids.

45:29.185 --> 45:30.394
Hey.

45:31.145 --> 45:32.896
How come we couldn't be friends, Blair?

45:32.980 --> 45:35.315
It's 'cause I can't stand you, Mrs. Lansing.

45:35.566 --> 45:37.484
You've got to lose that anger, honey.

45:38.194 --> 45:39.986
People get the face they deserve.

45:40.071 --> 45:41.238
See you in 10 days.

45:44.033 --> 45:45.117
Are you out of your mind?

45:45.201 --> 45:48.453
$4 billion for a $62 billion company?

45:48.538 --> 45:50.247
- It's a steal.
- It's not!

45:51.082 --> 45:52.499
But even if it were...

45:53.334 --> 45:55.377
- Yeah?
- I think he's trying to say

45:55.461 --> 45:57.629
you don't have $4 billion.

45:57.964 --> 45:59.131
-How much do I have?
-I don't know,

45:59.215 --> 46:03.343
but it's somewhere in the ballpark
of nothing close to $4 billion!

46:05.638 --> 46:07.097
Charlie, did I ever tell you about the time

46:07.181 --> 46:10.392
my parents saw
You Can't Take It With You on Broadway?

46:10.476 --> 46:12.394
That was $42,000.

46:12.478 --> 46:15.939
No, $42,350.

46:16.023 --> 46:19.443
And it was the last 350 that were the hardest.

46:19.527 --> 46:20.652
Sold my clothes,

46:20.736 --> 46:22.154
-dealt a little weed.
-Mom.

46:22.280 --> 46:24.281
Oh, I'm just kidding. I didn't sell my clothes.

46:24.365 --> 46:27.075
-This is for real.
-You think I don't fucking know that?

46:29.871 --> 46:32.372
I need $4 billion cash right now.

46:37.086 --> 46:38.295
I don't know who this guy is.

46:38.629 --> 46:40.839
I didn't vote for him.
I don't want him making decisions on his own

46:40.923 --> 46:41.965
about what's best for America.

46:42.049 --> 46:44.468
For all I know, he's one bad day away
from being Ted Kaczynski.

46:44.552 --> 46:48.054
We work with the FBI and the DOD
to determine what needs to be redacted.

46:48.139 --> 46:49.681
They're going to say
everything needs to be redacted.

46:49.765 --> 46:52.476
They know they have to convince me why.
And if I'm not sold...

46:52.560 --> 46:55.353
But just to get that far,
you have to call BCD, right?

46:55.438 --> 46:57.314
-To comment.
-That's it. That's the trip wire.

46:57.398 --> 46:59.691
You call BCD and Neal
has to give up his source

46:59.775 --> 47:00.942
or face a contempt charge.

47:01.027 --> 47:03.695
There's no route to the right
thing that doesn't include the possibility...

47:03.779 --> 47:05.947
The certainty
of a contempt charge.

47:06.032 --> 47:08.158
The route to the right thing
is this guy showing his face.

47:08.242 --> 47:10.535
Why is Neal paying the price
for this guy's patriotism?

47:10.620 --> 47:12.996
But we're past that.
And if I could switch places with him, I would.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.539
And I would
tell you the same thing,

47:14.624 --> 47:16.500
that a contempt charge could be the least...

47:16.584 --> 47:19.586
Too many people...
Look at how many people are in this room.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.421
They're in this room
'cause they can be trusted.

47:21.839 --> 47:25.008
Too many people already know that
a more serious crime has been committed.

47:25.092 --> 47:26.343
The FBI doesn't know that.

47:26.427 --> 47:27.636
- What if they find out?
- How?

47:27.720 --> 47:29.304
The only other person
who knows is the source,

47:29.388 --> 47:30.514
and he's not showing his face.

47:30.598 --> 47:32.098
- What if he does?
- He won't.

47:32.183 --> 47:33.433
So you completely trust a guy
who the only thing

47:33.518 --> 47:35.101
that we know about him
is that he stole

47:35.186 --> 47:36.561
classified documents
from the Department of Defense?

47:36.646 --> 47:38.688
We are three exits past that on the highway.

47:38.773 --> 47:40.690
I don't know why
this is a discussion.

47:40.775 --> 47:44.819
We obviously have to pursue this story
and we need to start right now.

47:45.947 --> 47:47.197
Wait here a second.

47:48.282 --> 47:51.660
Jenna, I want you to put
some menus on my desk.

47:51.744 --> 47:54.037
Three minutes after they get here,
I want you to come into my office

47:54.121 --> 47:55.789
and ask for the menus back.

47:55.873 --> 47:57.290
And that's it. You got it?

47:58.960 --> 48:00.710
-After who gets here?
-Trust me.

48:13.975 --> 48:16.309
In the time that you've been working here,
have you ever asked yourself

48:16.394 --> 48:18.728
why we always walk into
the studio through that door

48:18.813 --> 48:21.314
when we could just walk straight in
over that threshold?

48:21.399 --> 48:23.567
I did ask after I noticed it.

48:23.651 --> 48:25.235
What'd they say?

48:25.319 --> 48:27.487
-They said it was superstition.
-Huh.

48:28.155 --> 48:29.281
It's my superstition.

48:29.740 --> 48:33.493
Never asked anyone else to do it,
they just did.

48:33.578 --> 48:36.621
It's a longer walk.
I kind of feel responsible for that.

48:37.623 --> 48:39.666
You feel responsible for a lot of things.

48:40.876 --> 48:42.669
You already called BCD, right?

48:43.546 --> 48:45.130
A few hours ago
when you went to the bathroom,

48:45.214 --> 48:47.507
you were really calling BCD for comment.

48:48.676 --> 48:50.051
Yeah.

48:50.553 --> 48:52.095
You can do the story or not do the story,

48:52.179 --> 48:55.849
but now a decision can't be made
that considers my protection.

48:56.934 --> 48:58.685
I gave them my name.

49:01.731 --> 49:04.983
For a long time after you started here,
I didn't know your name.

49:06.611 --> 49:08.194
You called me Punjab.

49:10.114 --> 49:11.448
Yeah, you know, I...

49:12.450 --> 49:14.034
I sure know it now.

49:17.371 --> 49:18.705
Thank you.

49:19.415 --> 49:21.291
-Do something for me, would you?
-Sure.

49:21.375 --> 49:22.709
Give me the source.

49:23.919 --> 49:25.378
I need some skin in the game

49:25.463 --> 49:28.298
and they're gonna have
a trickier time of it with my profile.

49:28.382 --> 49:31.885
They'll need a day to figure out what to do
and negotiate with me and Rebecca.

49:31.969 --> 49:34.054
-Yeah, all right.
-One more thing.

49:34.138 --> 49:36.681
Do you have any place you can
get to for a day or two?

49:37.558 --> 49:38.558
It won't come to that.

49:38.643 --> 49:41.436
Someplace you can get to
without using a credit card.

49:42.563 --> 49:43.855
I can't tell if you're kidding.

49:43.939 --> 49:45.440
Leave your phone at home by accident.

49:45.524 --> 49:48.902
Greyhound doesn't need to know your name.
You know what I'm saying.

49:49.695 --> 49:51.279
It's just contempt.

49:51.405 --> 49:54.115
Why don't you go transcribe your notes
from the call to BCD

49:54.200 --> 49:56.159
and distribute them in the conference room?

50:00.081 --> 50:02.082
Neal Sampat.

50:08.881 --> 50:10.674
-Hello.
-We're on a break in there.

50:11.676 --> 50:13.385
Don and I are a couple.

50:13.469 --> 50:14.844
We've been seeing
each other for a few months.

50:14.929 --> 50:17.597
You can tell anybody you want
and you can use the word couple.

50:19.183 --> 50:20.183
Don, what's going on?

50:20.267 --> 50:21.851
-Yeah, don't worry about it.
-Okay.

50:26.148 --> 50:28.692
I would love to go to
your parents' made-up party.

50:28.776 --> 50:30.360
Are you just saying that
because it's made up?

50:30.444 --> 50:32.570
Because I would love
to go on a made-up hike with your cousins.

50:32.655 --> 50:33.863
No,

50:33.948 --> 50:35.949
I'm saying it because I'm in love with you.

50:39.704 --> 50:41.037
I love you, Don.

50:41.622 --> 50:43.665
You don't have to say anything back.

50:47.962 --> 50:48.962
Uh...

50:49.255 --> 50:50.255
Ha!

50:50.423 --> 50:51.798
Oh, shit!

50:52.133 --> 50:53.633
You have been tested
and you failed that test.

50:53.718 --> 50:54.884
I did not do well on that test.

50:54.969 --> 50:57.595
-You bit down hard.
-I failed that test.

50:58.222 --> 51:00.265
As long as you know that.

51:00.349 --> 51:01.808
Are you worried about getting scooped?

51:01.976 --> 51:03.226
-No.
-Yes.

51:03.310 --> 51:07.188
Because now I got to trust that somebody else
is going to handle the story responsibly.

51:07.273 --> 51:12.026
What if whoever the source goes to next
just makes a 27,000-page document dump?

51:12.111 --> 51:13.570
Nobody elected you either.

51:13.654 --> 51:16.406
I agree there's a kink in the system,
but look at me.

51:16.490 --> 51:19.576
Have you ever seen
a more trustworthy person in your life?

51:19.660 --> 51:20.994
I was born like this.

51:21.078 --> 51:23.663
By the way, how much money do you have?

51:24.457 --> 51:25.790
In the bank?

51:25.875 --> 51:28.251
Yeah, in an unrelated matter,

51:28.335 --> 51:33.423
Leona's gonna need, like, $4 billion
or this network's gonna be liquidated.

51:34.759 --> 51:37.302
-What was that?
-Don't worry about it right now.

51:48.063 --> 51:50.607
I'm Special Agent Hutchinson
and this is Special Agent Levy.

51:50.691 --> 51:52.901
We're with the FBI
and we need to question Neal Sampat.

51:52.985 --> 51:55.320
We also have a search warrant
under seal for your hard drives.

51:55.404 --> 51:56.529
Mac.

51:56.614 --> 51:58.490
I understand you two
know each other socially?

51:58.574 --> 52:00.617
I was telling Agent Hutchinson,

52:00.701 --> 52:02.786
I think we haven't seen
each other since Christmas.

52:02.870 --> 52:04.621
Yeah, that's right. It was, uh...

52:04.705 --> 52:07.457
It wasn't Christmas Eve,
it was the night before.

52:07.541 --> 52:09.751
I'm Charlie Skinner. I'm in charge.

52:09.835 --> 52:12.796
A warrant under seal means you're prohibited
from disclosing that you were served.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.964
-If you disclose that you were served...
-Agent Hutchinson, I'm...

52:15.049 --> 52:16.090
You're Rebecca Halliday.

52:16.175 --> 52:18.218
-You're the attorney for Mr. Sampat.
-Yeah.

52:19.678 --> 52:22.555
I represent ACN in First Amendment matters.

52:24.391 --> 52:27.560
You should answer your phone.
It's going to be the Attorney General.

52:30.231 --> 52:31.773
Rebecca Halliday.

52:31.857 --> 52:33.817
Which of you is Neal Sampat?

52:33.901 --> 52:35.652
Our lawyer has just stepped away.

52:35.736 --> 52:36.986
I have a warrant, Mr. Skinner.

52:37.071 --> 52:39.405
-Your lawyer knows...
-I'm Spartacus, sir.

52:39.532 --> 52:42.408
Neal's not in the room.
Why don't we go in my office for a minute?

52:43.619 --> 52:44.828
I want to talk to them alone.

52:44.912 --> 52:46.246
Prepare the search, but don't start.

52:47.414 --> 52:49.582
You know how many hard drives
we have in this place?

53:03.264 --> 53:04.681
Keep your voices very low.

53:04.765 --> 53:06.099
You didn't tell me it was this.

53:06.183 --> 53:09.018
I don't know what this is, Molly,
and I told you as little as possible.

53:09.103 --> 53:11.938
I have to say, raiding a newsroom
has got to be damn near unprecedented.

53:12.022 --> 53:13.398
We need to find this guy.

53:13.482 --> 53:14.524
This is a bad guy.

53:14.608 --> 53:15.859
We can't take your word for that.

53:15.943 --> 53:17.986
And as you well know,
bad guys are good sources.

53:18.070 --> 53:19.737
We want to work with you
on this story and we want...

53:19.822 --> 53:20.947
We want to work with you, too,

53:21.031 --> 53:22.782
but we're going to question Neal Sampat.

53:23.242 --> 53:24.868
The Attorney General is on the phone
telling your lawyer

53:24.952 --> 53:26.661
we're gonna hold him till he
gives up his source.

53:26.745 --> 53:28.538
And I'll tell you what else.

53:28.622 --> 53:30.999
There are three levels of Internet systems
the government works on.

53:31.083 --> 53:32.834
This guy was working on JWICS,

53:32.918 --> 53:36.337
and we don't believe he has the ability
to transfer content to the protocol router.

53:36.422 --> 53:39.799
So if we can prove your guy helped him do it,
he's getting charged with a full boat.

53:40.676 --> 53:42.468
He's going to Leavenworth.

53:42.636 --> 53:45.471
So if you want to work with us, let's start.

53:47.141 --> 53:48.391
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

53:48.475 --> 53:50.768
- I just need your menu.
- Sorry.

53:50.853 --> 53:53.730
We're working through dinner tonight.

53:53.814 --> 53:55.607
Are we allowed to buy your guys dinner?

53:55.691 --> 53:56.691
No.

53:57.943 --> 53:59.027
Thanks.

54:00.821 --> 54:02.906
Molly, I know the name of the source, too.

54:05.075 --> 54:06.075
-You do?
-Yeah.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.577
-Who else?
-That's it.

54:10.414 --> 54:12.582
We need to start searching
your hard drives now.

54:12.666 --> 54:14.751
We won't talk anymore
till your lawyer's in the room.

54:26.472 --> 54:28.348
Excuse me. Excuse me.

54:30.851 --> 54:32.268
-What's going on?
-Welcome back.

54:33.520 --> 54:34.896
Sloan, what's going on?

54:35.022 --> 54:37.357
It's about Neal's story...

54:39.360 --> 54:40.485
Go ahead.

54:41.195 --> 54:42.946
Please step away from the desks.

54:43.989 --> 54:46.324
Could someone please tell me
where Neal Sampat works?

54:50.579 --> 54:52.038
He works over there.
