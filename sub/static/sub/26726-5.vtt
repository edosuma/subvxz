00:18.720 --> 00:21.960
-[crowd cheering]
-Robozuna! Robozuna!

00:22.040 --> 00:24.240
Robo-Robozuna!

00:24.320 --> 00:29.760
And it’s down to the third and deciding
round of the game here at Micia Arena!

00:30.320 --> 00:32.400
Two Border League teams fighting to prove

00:32.480 --> 00:35.040
they deserve to move up to
the Latium League.

00:35.120 --> 00:39.360
Oh! Ha-ha! You got to love Robozuna!

00:39.440 --> 00:40.800
Whoa! Argh!

00:40.880 --> 00:42.880
Hmm. Going to need new table.

00:45.400 --> 00:50.480
[Slick] On the field, here comes
Combatabots Clunk, Mangle and Spark,

00:50.560 --> 00:55.400
representing Team Veredus in this sure-
to-be-thrilling, three-on-three match-up!

00:56.400 --> 00:59.240
And now, ready to do battle
for Team Ursus,

00:59.320 --> 01:01.680
here come Scratcher, Crackler and...

01:02.200 --> 01:05.760
Oh! It looks like they're still making
last-minute adjustments

01:05.840 --> 01:08.200
to their star Combatabot, Lathe.

01:08.280 --> 01:11.440
-Ariston! We might have a problem.
-Huh?

01:12.120 --> 01:14.480
Look! They’re working on
Lathe’s weapon arm!

01:15.000 --> 01:18.240
Relax. They're probably just polishing
his Power Puncher.

01:18.320 --> 01:22.240
Doesn't matter how shiny it is.
We're ready. We trained for it.

01:22.720 --> 01:26.560
[Livia] That’s not the power puncher.
It’s some kind of mega drill!

01:26.640 --> 01:28.400
[growls and mutters]

01:28.480 --> 01:30.600
You didn’t know about this upgrade?

01:30.680 --> 01:33.080
Your job is to check for things like that.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.720
Sorry. You’re right. Should've checked.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.200
Just been worried about Feronia,

01:38.280 --> 01:43.120
imagining her stuck in that Corvus prison,
being bullied by Centurion guards.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.640
I get it, but you have plenty
to worry about right here.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.520
Keep your head in the game,
or our bots will lose theirs!

01:51.280 --> 01:55.400
Behold, the dread-shred!

01:55.960 --> 01:59.000
Beware, the crack-whack!

02:00.440 --> 02:04.920
Be afraid. Be very afraid.
The thriller-driller!

02:05.000 --> 02:06.440
[whirrs]

02:09.120 --> 02:11.680
Round three! Game on!

02:12.520 --> 02:13.560
[grunts]

02:15.720 --> 02:16.880
Thudball mine!

02:19.320 --> 02:22.760
[Slink] Oh! Scratcher’s shredder-shield
sends Spark flying!

02:23.560 --> 02:26.480
Come here! I’m going to crack-whack ya!

02:36.000 --> 02:37.960
Mangle got this!

02:40.960 --> 02:42.840
All right, Mangle!

02:48.600 --> 02:50.640
No! Mangle! Watch out!

02:51.280 --> 02:52.200
[groans]

02:54.600 --> 02:55.560
[groans]

02:56.000 --> 02:56.920
Oh.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.200
-No!
-No!

03:28.280 --> 03:29.960
[distant cheer of crowd]

03:30.680 --> 03:34.280
[cackles] Time for my daily drill!

03:36.200 --> 03:37.680
No, thank you.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.200
[both grunt and groan]

03:44.840 --> 03:45.800
[roars]

03:46.160 --> 03:47.280
[grunts]

03:48.280 --> 03:49.720
Clunk, don’t miss.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.920
Clunk never miss.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.800
Beware, the crack-whack. Agh!

03:58.760 --> 04:00.040
The dread-shred!

04:00.120 --> 04:02.520
Clunk! Spark! The ricochet handoff!

04:06.800 --> 04:08.480
[Clunk] Spark! Catch!

04:13.600 --> 04:17.200
Score! Team Veredus wins the round
and the match!

04:17.280 --> 04:18.640
[cheering and whooping]

04:18.720 --> 04:20.840
The ricochet handoff?

04:20.920 --> 04:23.560
Mangle came up with it.
Taught it to Spark and Clunk.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.800
[bleeping]

04:27.880 --> 04:30.720
[grunts] Drill time over!

04:31.920 --> 04:33.000
[squeals]

04:39.960 --> 04:43.120
Not our best day on the field,
but a win is a win.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.760
Sorry, Lanista.
I should have known about Lathe's drill.

04:47.480 --> 04:51.400
Just can't stop worrying about
Feronia stuck in that prison.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.480
Ariston, I understand. We all do.

04:54.440 --> 04:57.080
But this is bigger than just you.
This is about teamwork...

04:57.600 --> 05:00.160
and you need to focus
when your team needs you.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.280
It’s Feronia who needs us.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.280
We should be breaking her out of prison.

05:04.600 --> 05:05.760
Niven’s working on it.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.840
But we have the holo-disk blueprint
of where she is.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.120
And what about the electric fences?

05:16.840 --> 05:17.840
Got a plan.

05:19.960 --> 05:22.920
There are alarms, cameras,
automated defences.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.440
The security over-rider.

05:24.520 --> 05:29.120
The prison’s carved into the giant coral
rock structure with only one way in.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.760
Sorry, got nothing for rock coral.

05:32.840 --> 05:36.960
[excited squealing]

05:37.040 --> 05:37.960
Not now, Scramble.

05:38.440 --> 05:42.240
[excited squealing]

05:42.320 --> 05:44.000
Scramble have good idea.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.120
[taps metal]

05:53.000 --> 05:55.560
Mangle take new arm out for spin.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.680
For spin. Ha-ha-ha!

05:58.760 --> 06:00.200
Mangle make joke.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.520
Whoa-oh-oh!

06:13.880 --> 06:17.920
Okay. Think he's gonna need
a little more practice time.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.160
Good call.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.240
-Meantime, we can go over our plan.
-Plan?

06:25.360 --> 06:29.480
While the rest of you attack the entrance,
distract the Centurion guards,

06:29.560 --> 06:32.720
Mangle will drill through the weakest spot
on the rock side.

06:33.680 --> 06:37.080
It could work, but even if it does,
we’ll be recognised.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.480
Corvus will know it's Team Veredus.

06:40.040 --> 06:44.000
No more Robozuna.
We'd have to go into hiding forever.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.840
Of course, there is one way.

06:51.320 --> 06:52.480
[chuckles]

06:52.560 --> 06:56.680
So, it can armour us and disguise us
at the same time?

06:57.800 --> 06:59.160
Pure Dad move.

06:59.240 --> 07:02.040
You’ve been planning to break Feronia out
all along!

07:02.320 --> 07:06.080
Just waiting for the timing to be right...
and for you to be prepared.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.400
I helped. Your dad said the disguises
had to be styling.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.640
Oh! You were in on it?

07:11.720 --> 07:13.040
So, let’s armour up!

07:45.280 --> 07:46.840
Not look like Clunk...

07:47.600 --> 07:48.680
but still Clunk!

07:48.760 --> 07:50.080
[grunts]

07:50.800 --> 07:53.440
A little heavy, but I’ll get used to it.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.840
Whoa-oh!

07:54.920 --> 07:56.360
[chuckles] So you approve?

07:56.440 --> 07:58.440
Think we’re looking good!

07:58.920 --> 08:00.680
Look like Combatabots.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.480
So, what do you say?
Ready to try them out?

08:04.560 --> 08:06.000
Ready to rescue Feronia?

08:06.080 --> 08:07.080
Ready! Uh...

08:07.160 --> 08:08.000
Whoa!

08:19.320 --> 08:22.320
Feronia... enjoying your stay?

08:23.000 --> 08:26.040
It's wonderful,
feeling part of Corvus again.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.400
Vermis thought you should be disposed of.

08:32.800 --> 08:35.800
But I reminded him
it’s not his job to think.

08:36.680 --> 08:38.520
It’s only to follow my orders.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.440
So, I’m keeping you around.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.480
Such kindness.

08:43.560 --> 08:49.520
Well, I do owe you. They say
your robotic replacements saved my life.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.560
Anything I can do to help Corvus.

08:53.040 --> 08:56.000
Hm. Well, now that you mention it...

09:04.160 --> 09:08.000
Ariston, when we breach the fence,
you and Mangle head to the rock side.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.680
If we need to,
we’ll keep the Centurions busy

09:10.760 --> 09:12.240
until you get Feronia out.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.880
Livia, Chike?

09:13.960 --> 09:16.800
We’ll shut down their defences,
alarms and cameras.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.440
Just don't know how long
we can keep them down.

09:19.520 --> 09:22.760
No worries. We'll get Feronia out fast.

09:22.840 --> 09:23.920
[distant marching]

09:24.000 --> 09:25.080
Hm.

09:28.000 --> 09:28.920
Now!

09:34.440 --> 09:37.400
[inhales and exhales]

09:38.240 --> 09:40.000
Ha! Centurions.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.320
You can’t think. You only obey orders.

09:44.040 --> 09:47.480
I’m no different than you
in Danuvia’s eyes.

09:47.560 --> 09:51.600
Ha! She considers me a mindless robot!

09:52.720 --> 09:55.920
One day, she'll regret not listening
to my advice.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.600
One day, Danuvia will obey me.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.480
[Centurion] Commander Vermis,
return to cell block immediately,

10:03.560 --> 10:05.560
by order of her Highness Danuvia.

10:05.640 --> 10:06.480
[angry grunt]

10:12.160 --> 10:15.600
Okay, there’s the control box
and there’s the fence.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.200
Clunk got this!

10:23.720 --> 10:25.480
[grunts and groans]

10:27.320 --> 10:30.480
Uh, Spark is first. You’re second.

10:30.560 --> 10:33.520
That’s right, Chike.
We need to deal with this control box.

10:33.600 --> 10:37.000
Spark, do your thing to overload
the electrified field around it.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.400
Taser-jab!

10:49.360 --> 10:51.720
Alarms, cameras, off.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.360
Security system neutralised.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.320
[snorts softly] Neutralised?

10:56.400 --> 10:58.680
Hero talk! Goes with the costume.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.560
Clunk, now you’re up!

11:14.560 --> 11:17.200
-[Clunk grunts]
-[Lanista] Remember, teamwork.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.200
Stay focused and follow the plan.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.000
Find Feronia and get out of there.

11:22.520 --> 11:25.840
-We’ll be tracking your progress.
-[Ariston] I’m practically back already.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.480
Look! Still Clunk.

11:32.760 --> 11:37.400
You know, maybe they won’t need us
to keep the Centurions busy.

11:38.320 --> 11:41.040
Whoa! Of course, could be wrong.

11:44.840 --> 11:45.800
[gasps]

11:45.880 --> 11:48.240
Huh? Secure the perimeter!

11:51.760 --> 11:52.800
Better hurry.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.240
Oops.

11:56.520 --> 11:57.680
Huh?

11:58.960 --> 11:59.840
[grunts]

12:06.120 --> 12:08.000
Careful, don't need a cave-in.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.960
-[grunts]
-Yeah! That’s more like it!

12:26.280 --> 12:27.120
[bleeping]

12:27.200 --> 12:28.280
They’ve stopped.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.600
What better time to test out our new look?

12:35.560 --> 12:37.320
Psst! Over here!

12:39.840 --> 12:42.200
Oh, yeah! I’m liking this get-up.

12:42.920 --> 12:43.960
[grunts]

12:47.480 --> 12:49.520
Whoa! [grunts]

12:50.080 --> 12:51.640
Got to work on that. [grunts]

12:56.800 --> 12:57.920
[grunts]

12:58.000 --> 12:58.880
[comm bleeps]

12:59.360 --> 13:01.920
-[Lanista] <i>Have you found her?</i>
-Uh, not yet.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.480
<i>Then why have you stopped?</i>

13:03.560 --> 13:04.600
Ooh!

13:04.680 --> 13:07.840
Right, sorry. Teamwork.
Staying focused. Got to go.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.320
[Mangle] This unlock cells.

13:13.320 --> 13:17.560
Great. Now, all we got to do is figure out
which one is Feronia’s.

13:19.080 --> 13:19.920
[sighs]

13:20.000 --> 13:20.840
No.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.880
[sighs] Not here.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.000
Wrong.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.680
Niven?

13:31.680 --> 13:33.240
Quick! Come with us!

13:34.360 --> 13:36.240
-[Niven] And who exactly are you?
-Huh...

13:37.560 --> 13:38.440
[chuckles]

13:38.520 --> 13:41.240
Right! It’s Ariston, Mangle.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.360
We’ve come for Feronia.
The outfits were Lanista’s idea.

13:45.440 --> 13:49.920
Figures. He always did like
that kind of thing. What’s with the...?

13:50.760 --> 13:51.600
Long story.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.880
Now, what are you doing here?

13:54.960 --> 13:56.720
Like you, came for Feronia.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.360
Got caught scoping out the prison.
Had a team ready to break her out, too.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.160
Well, now you’ve got a new team!

14:06.320 --> 14:08.360
Come on, I’ll take you to her cell.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.800
You two work well together.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.280
[sighs] It’s empty.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.200
They must have moved her.

14:31.560 --> 14:32.600
Yeah, but where?

14:35.680 --> 14:36.880
Mangle find out.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.440
Another long story?

14:41.400 --> 14:44.760
[robot voice] <i>Escort prisoner Feronia</i>
<i>to the Robotics Lab.</i>

14:45.120 --> 14:46.360
Impressive!

14:48.560 --> 14:50.560
Right. The Robotics Lab.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.600
Okay. We're here. Got to go there.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.600
So, what do you think of my playroom?

15:01.080 --> 15:03.920
I didn't know you were so into robots.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.600
Well, you sparked my interest
by practically turning me into one.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.360
Before you decided to leave Corvus,

15:11.440 --> 15:15.560
you were doing some rather sophisticated
robotic research.

15:16.120 --> 15:21.680
As I recall, you were attempting to create
a bot that could think and learn.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.160
How did that go for you?

15:23.240 --> 15:25.360
It went nowhere. Dead-end.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.040
I abandoned the project.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.320
Oh, what a shame.

15:28.400 --> 15:32.120
Well, the good news is,
I’ve revived your research.

15:34.360 --> 15:38.000
I call it Project Evolution!

15:38.480 --> 15:44.480
And my Corvus researchers at the Facility
have already had a great deal of success.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.000
Allow me to demonstrate.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.600
First, your normal Centurion.

16:06.360 --> 16:09.200
And that’s supposed to show me what?

16:09.280 --> 16:13.760
That a normal Centurion only does what
it’s programmed to do, follow orders.

16:13.840 --> 16:17.000
It doesn’t know how to respond
to new stimuli.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.360
And now one of the Centurions
from Project Evolution.

16:28.040 --> 16:31.840
Notice it is able to assess its situation,
study it, learn from it.

16:49.360 --> 16:51.400
As you can see,
there’s still work to be done,

16:51.480 --> 16:54.520
but I’m hoping you’ll be able
to assist with that.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.160
The prison is under attack.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.360
Stay with the prisoner! Take me to Vermis!

17:10.480 --> 17:12.480
Concentrate your assault on that ridge!

17:13.480 --> 17:15.240
We can only distract them for so long,

17:15.320 --> 17:17.320
then Ariston and Mangle
will be on their own.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.080
<i>Who’s attacking?</i>

17:19.160 --> 17:22.800
I would presume outlaws.
They shut down all our security systems!

17:22.880 --> 17:25.560
Then get them back online!

17:25.840 --> 17:28.400
We are working on it, Your Highness.

17:28.480 --> 17:32.600
Meanwhile, no one has made it past us.
The prison itself is secure.

17:34.760 --> 17:35.800
[angry groan]

17:35.880 --> 17:37.680
So I see!

17:45.560 --> 17:47.160
[gasps] What do you want?

17:47.240 --> 17:49.600
-It’s me, Ariston!
-Me, Mangle!

17:49.680 --> 17:54.120
-Feronia. I’ve been so worried.
-I’m fine, Ariston.

17:54.200 --> 17:57.120
-Good-see you, Feronia.
-Thank you, Mangle.

17:57.720 --> 18:01.520
I see you found the crystal...
and a new attachment.

18:01.920 --> 18:05.320
It’s amazing what he can do now.
He can learn. He can joke...

18:05.600 --> 18:09.200
Not very well, but... I’ll tell you
all about it once we get you out--

18:09.280 --> 18:11.280
Ariston, I can’t go.

18:11.760 --> 18:15.320
Danuvia. She’s trying to create something
I have to stop.

18:15.800 --> 18:19.960
I just don’t know how yet.
Until I do, I have to stay.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.480
It’s too dangerous.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.800
What she’s working on
could be far more dangerous.

18:24.880 --> 18:25.720
This is...

18:26.200 --> 18:27.480
Bigger than you.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.880
Yes. This is bigger than me,
bigger than us.

18:30.960 --> 18:31.880
I’ll be fine.

18:32.360 --> 18:35.360
Mangle, take care of him.
Take care of each other.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.520
Your lives matter more
than you can imagine.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.480
[Niven] Security's back online!

18:41.040 --> 18:42.840
-Niven!
-Feronia.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.520
-She’s not coming.
-What?

18:44.600 --> 18:46.160
Now, we need to get out of here.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.240
[distant gunfire]

18:52.760 --> 18:53.920
We’re out of time.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.720
What about Ariston and Mangle?
Feronia?

18:56.800 --> 18:58.760
Not sure we can protect them anymore.

18:58.840 --> 19:01.600
-[gunfire]
-I’m not sure we can protect ourselves.

19:02.480 --> 19:05.600
A sensor has detected a break
in the prison's western wall.

19:06.760 --> 19:10.080
There's a breach in sector seven!
Intruders! Don't let them escape!

19:10.560 --> 19:13.680
How could you let
something like this happen?

19:13.760 --> 19:17.560
Not me. Remember, you chose
to have Centurions guard the prison.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.640
There, on the side of the hall!

19:22.840 --> 19:24.200
The drill arm.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.360
Centurions!

19:29.760 --> 19:30.960
Go!

19:31.040 --> 19:33.440
Nope. Not leaving anyone else behind.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.160
Looks like we’re going to have
a little fight on our hands.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.920
No time. We’re supposed to get in,
get out.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.800
Think. Now, we do need a cave in.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.480
Mangle understand.

19:43.560 --> 19:44.920
Mangle focus.

19:56.720 --> 19:57.600
Mangle!

19:58.880 --> 20:00.000
Smart bot!

20:01.480 --> 20:02.400
Come on!

20:09.920 --> 20:12.680
-[Lanista] They’re heading out.
-They’d better hurry.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.600
[loud thud]

20:25.000 --> 20:26.120
Still Clunk!

20:30.560 --> 20:31.400
[coughs]

20:31.480 --> 20:32.880
Ah! A cave-in!

20:38.680 --> 20:40.400
Ariston! Mangle!

20:42.000 --> 20:44.560
-Niven!
-Where’s Feronia?

20:45.440 --> 20:46.840
It's a long story!

20:53.560 --> 20:58.120
Have to say, your Project Evolution
is quite impressive.

21:00.000 --> 21:00.960
Well?

21:01.560 --> 21:03.760
We have images of the attackers,

21:03.840 --> 21:06.200
captured by
the perimeter security cameras.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.480
I’m waiting.

21:09.640 --> 21:14.720
Disguises? Some look to be robots.
Doesn’t matter.

21:14.800 --> 21:18.640
We’ll catch them and we will crush them.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.080
I have no doubt.

21:20.160 --> 21:24.280
You may remember, robots were also used
to rescue the drillers

21:24.360 --> 21:25.840
when we captured Feronia.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.400
You think they came to get her?

21:28.480 --> 21:32.400
At first, I thought so,
but we now know that wasn't the case.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.800
They were after a different prisoner.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.040
Niven Lengil.
