Shit, he can't kill me

It's now $30,000!

04:54.837 --> 04:58.257
How can the interest be
10 times in 3 months!

04:58.674 --> 05:01.719
He said he'll injure you and
take the insurance claim.

05:01.760 --> 05:06.056
That's why they lent it to us
when we got nothing.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.851
Why'd you sign
the insurance!

05:08.976 --> 05:10.644
I had no other choice!

I'll do it later.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.945
It's okay. I'll do it.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.489
Go home and rest.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.158
Mom? Look at me.

16:34.035 --> 16:34.911

be 10 times more?

17:31.051 --> 17:32.552
Don't look, Mom!

17:35.180 --> 17:37.015

18:30.610 --> 18:31.236
Grab it.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.114
I said, grab it!

18:40.453 --> 18:41.746
If I become a cripple...

18:42.330 --> 18:45.667
there's no one to take care of
my poor mom.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.837
Don't you have a mom?

18:55.093 --> 18:56.261
It's not high enough.

18:57.095 --> 19:00.515
I can't be a cripple
and burden Mom!

19:04.978 --> 19:08.898
If you die, the insurance gets
messed up. Just jump.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.692
Evil bastard.

19:11.568 --> 19:12.735
Who's that woman?

19:14.404 --> 19:16.656
Please! Give me more time!

19:16.656 --> 19:19.033
Just one more week!

19:20.368 --> 19:21.035
Please!

19:41.472 --> 19:43.600
Get lost before
I throw you over!

19:45.602 --> 19:48.938
It's all my fault.
Cuz I abandoned you...

19:53.276 --> 19:55.820
Cut the shit! You bitch!

19:56.988 --> 19:58.281

dying by your hands.

One joint completely gone.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.870

what you owe us.

20:48.706 --> 20:49.874

20:50.708 --> 20:53.044
You'll burn to death!

20:53.127 --> 20:58.216
You'll scream in agony
and burn in hell forever!

21:02.262 --> 21:04.222
How dare you say that
to my son!

21:22.448 --> 21:25.910
Stop following me!
Go away!

49:30.927 --> 49:32.053
What do you want?

49:35.598 --> 49:36.432
This?

49:41.270 --> 49:43.106
I lasted 50 years here.

49:44.607 --> 49:46.192
But ended up with nothing.

49:48.319 --> 49:50.947
The owners get new buildings
coming in.

49:52.740 --> 49:54.617
What about tenants like us?

49:56.828 --> 49:57.954
What is money?

50:01.124 --> 50:04.877
I had no intention of paying
back from the start.

50:05.420 --> 50:07.964
I got it to spend like crazy,
then die.

50:10.633 --> 50:16.014
Ever looked down on
Cheonggyecheon from the sky?

50:30.194 --> 50:32.280
This place is going to be gone.

50:34.741 --> 50:38.870
I came when I was 16,
50 years ago.

51:03.811 --> 51:05.354
Soon, this place will be...

51:06.481 --> 51:07.857
filled with high-rises, too.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.044
Death complicates the claim!

51:29.378 --> 51:30.296
Death?

51:33.049 --> 51:34.425
What is death?

51:49.524 --> 51:51.984
Don't feel guilty
cuz of me.

52:26.936 --> 52:29.313
<i>HAPPY PRIVATE LOANS</i>

52:46.289 --> 52:50.835
<i>LEE SANG-GU $30,000</i>

53:21.449 --> 53:23.409
It made me feel sorry to you.

53:37.840 --> 53:40.176
What did you do
to the man today?

53:41.552 --> 53:43.804
Jumped off a building
by himself.

53:44.472 --> 53:45.765
He must be dead.

53:51.812 --> 53:53.022
What is money?

53:55.274 --> 53:55.983
Money?

54:00.279 --> 54:02.990
The beginning and the end
of all things.

54:05.493 --> 54:11.415
Love, honor,
violence, fury...

54:11.874 --> 54:14.669
hatred, jealousy...

54:16.587 --> 54:17.797
revenge...

54:19.757 --> 54:21.008
death.

54:21.634 --> 54:22.677
Revenge?

54:26.389 --> 54:28.891
Yes, revenge.

54:36.065 --> 54:38.943
If anyone comes here,
don't open the door.

54:39.068 --> 54:40.194
Call me right away!

54:40.987 --> 54:41.904
I will.

54:44.532 --> 54:46.033
Do you wanna go out?

55:06.429 --> 55:07.471
Tasty?

55:21.694 --> 55:22.778
Try this on.

55:27.241 --> 55:28.284
So cute.

55:41.047 --> 55:42.256
Me! Give it to me!

55:46.802 --> 55:49.513
Say, one more please.
Ask for one more.

55:55.895 --> 55:57.313
Sir, please.

55:57.355 --> 56:00.316
Sir, please help me.

56:00.608 --> 56:03.611
What is he, a retard?

56:09.158 --> 56:10.076
Look.

56:12.411 --> 56:13.496
What's so funny?

56:15.956 --> 56:19.710
It's funny.
Grown adults acting like kids.

56:22.338 --> 56:25.841
A mom having fun with
her son she met in 30 years.

56:29.345 --> 56:30.679
- That's funny?
- Ma'am!

56:32.056 --> 56:35.184
Crazy bitch!

56:36.560 --> 56:37.353
What?

56:38.896 --> 56:40.564
Let's

56:43.442 --> 56:44.902
I'm sorry. Apologize!

56:45.986 --> 56:46.946
I'm sorry.

57:13.556 --> 57:15.891
Get back!

57:19.395 --> 57:20.729
Devilish bastard!

57:21.313 --> 57:23.399
I never once forgot you!

57:24.483 --> 57:25.401
See?

57:25.860 --> 57:30.739
I can't do a thing as a cripple!
I'm a bum!

57:31.157 --> 57:32.908
Now, it's your turn to die!

57:33.075 --> 57:34.243
Get down!

57:35.077 --> 57:36.203
<i>Kneel!</i>

57:37.037 --> 57:38.622
Mom didn't do anything!

57:40.082 --> 57:41.917
Mom, my ass!

57:42.460 --> 57:46.338
You insulted me in front of
my mom for just $3,000!

57:47.631 --> 57:48.716
Watch closely.

57:52.636 --> 57:54.513
I told you
you'd burn to death!

57:54.763 --> 57:57.600
Pour it on! Now!

57:58.184 --> 58:00.769
Forgive him. It's my fault.

58:00.811 --> 58:03.481
I abandoned him.
He grew up without love.

58:03.522 --> 58:05.107
Bullshit!

58:05.524 --> 58:07.610
The bastard was born evil.

58:07.860 --> 58:11.739
He's the devil who tests
people with money!

58:12.615 --> 58:14.825
Pour it on! Now!

58:17.578 --> 58:18.454
Son of a bitch.

58:22.166 --> 58:23.250
Kang-do! No!

58:24.084 --> 58:25.002
- No!
- Don't move!

58:29.340 --> 58:30.674
I'll light it for ya!

58:48.943 --> 58:49.777
Kang-do!

58:50.778 --> 58:51.654
Stop.

58:52.696 --> 58:53.531
Stop.

58:54.990 --> 58:55.950
Stop.

59:23.936 --> 59:25.521
He probably didn't die.

59:32.236 --> 59:34.446
Or report it to the cops.

01:02:43.886 --> 01:02:44.803
I'm scared.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:51.727
That you'll suddenly vanish.

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:58.442
I can't survive being
alone again.

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:03.739
Today's your birthday.

01:03:07.576 --> 01:03:09.995
Go buy a cake.
Let's celebrate.

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:15.626
So, this was my birthday
present?

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.130
It looks a little small for me.

01:03:20.923 --> 01:03:21.715
Why?

01:03:23.342 --> 01:03:25.219
It's not clone yet?

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.218
Boss, it's Lee Kang-do.

01:06:57.264 --> 01:06:58.807
Why you!

01:06:59.558 --> 01:07:00.892
You son of a bitch!

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:06.398
I'm sorry, boss!

01:07:14.448 --> 01:07:16.074
I'm sorry, boss!

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:18.035
You ungrateful bastard.

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:19.828
Get lost!

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:21.997
Someone else is doing it.

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:24.082
Boss!

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:26.835
Please give my mom back!

01:07:27.502 --> 01:07:28.837
You have a mother?

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:36.178
That's why you quit?
Scared of revenge?

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:40.390
It's not me.

01:07:41.016 --> 01:07:43.351
It's probably one of
the cripples you made.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:53.862
I told you to collect money,
not make 'em cripples!

01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:56.782
You butcher!

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:26.685
Where were you?
Know how much I worried!

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.814
Why didn't you take
your phone!

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:38.031
I'm sorry.

01:09:30.167 --> 01:09:34.796
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:40.260
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:55.233
I have a favor.

01:09:57.277 --> 01:09:58.862
Plant me a tree.

01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:13.043
Where's the sweater?
I wanna wear it today.

01:10:38.777 --> 01:10:41.738
Can a pine tree live
by the water?

01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:43.698
It'll live.

01:10:46.034 --> 01:10:46.952
Thanks.

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:56.544
When I die, bury me here.

01:10:56.795 --> 01:10:57.545
What?

01:10:58.546 --> 01:11:00.757
Don't say stuff like that!

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:05.011
Everyone dies.

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:11.309
But still...
It's not for a long time.

01:11:57.772 --> 01:11:59.065
Go to your bed!

01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:02.235
Get out!

01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:20.462
Did I do something wrong?

01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:34.768
Go water the tree.
It'll wither to death.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.561
Okay.

01:12:47.322 --> 01:12:48.198
Hello?

01:12:50.784 --> 01:12:53.119
Kang-do! Someone's here!

01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:54.662
- Mom?
- <i>Why're you doing this!</i>

01:12:55.497 --> 01:12:56.247
Mom!

01:12:58.124 --> 01:12:59.751
Stop it!

01:12:59.834 --> 01:13:03.797
No! Please! No!

01:13:06.257 --> 01:13:08.968
Help me! Help me!

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:11.179
Who the fuck are you!

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:13.264
Why are you doing this!

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:13.848
Mom?

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:21.856
It's my fault!
Not my son's! Please!

01:13:26.694 --> 01:13:27.529
Mom!

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:53.930
Mom!

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:36.681
Yes, Han's Machinery.

01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:39.350
Yes, of course we can do it.

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:44.481
$20? That's impossible.

01:14:44.481 --> 01:14:47.108
The price of copper went up.

01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:51.571
Then, I'll do it for $30.
That's it.

01:14:52.197 --> 01:14:54.699
Hello? Hello?

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:57.952
Son of a bitch!

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:00.788
Take the skin off my back
why don't ya!

01:15:00.914 --> 01:15:02.707
Damn bastard!

01:15:04.459 --> 01:15:07.420
Damn sons of bitches!

01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:12.550
Greedy bastards!

01:15:12.592 --> 01:15:13.968
Sons of bitches!

01:15:14.302 --> 01:15:16.930
Damn bastards!

01:15:40.328 --> 01:15:42.914
I'll kill you! Bastard!

01:15:43.665 --> 01:15:46.459
I'll rip you to shreds!
You bastard!

01:15:50.838 --> 01:15:52.048
Looking for Jong-do?

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:54.133
He quit and went to
Yang-pyung.

01:16:02.809 --> 01:16:03.893
Where's your son?

01:16:04.769 --> 01:16:06.604
Where's Lee Jong-do!

01:16:18.283 --> 01:16:19.325
Jong-do.

01:16:20.702 --> 01:16:22.120
Your friend's here.

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:29.877
How nice there's a friend
who still remembers you.

01:16:30.378 --> 01:16:32.422
You must be so happy.

01:16:32.797 --> 01:16:36.509
Don't you ever die
cuz of money.

01:16:37.135 --> 01:16:39.053
Damn money!

01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:51.899
How can you leave me behind
over losing an arm?

01:16:52.025 --> 01:16:54.736
After everything I did
to raise you.

01:16:58.072 --> 01:16:59.824
Damn bastard!

01:17:00.408 --> 01:17:02.702
That bastard...

01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:22.096
Where's your dad! Tell me!

01:17:37.862 --> 01:17:38.946
What'd you do yesterday?

01:17:40.615 --> 01:17:41.824
Thought of you, fool.

01:17:42.492 --> 01:17:43.409
So?

01:17:44.786 --> 01:17:49.415
Never once forgot you
doing this to me for $10,000.

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:52.168
So, what did you do!

01:17:52.794 --> 01:17:54.253
Getting revenge!

01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:57.423
Tell the truth!

01:17:57.465 --> 01:18:00.468
Stabbing you!
Burning you!

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:03.012
Sinking you!
Ripping you to shreds!

01:18:04.222 --> 01:18:05.640
That's not enough!

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:09.644
If you had parents,
I'd take 'em as you watch and...

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:14.732
But it's no use.

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:17.193
A cripple like me.

01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:19.320
All I can do is hope
you rot in hell.

01:18:19.654 --> 01:18:20.488
Just you wait.

01:18:21.114 --> 01:18:25.201
I remind my kid what you did
every single clay!

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:52.854
<i>When mommy goes to the island</i>

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:59.193
<i>to pick oysters</i>

01:19:00.528 --> 01:19:06.701
<i>the baby is left alone</i>

01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:14.292
<i>to watch the house</i>

01:19:15.168 --> 01:19:21.591
<i>Ebb and flow of tidal waves</i>

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:28.222
<i>sounds like a lullaby</i>

01:19:30.725 --> 01:19:37.064
<i>With his elbow as a pillow</i>

01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:45.114
<i>the baby falls asleep</i>

01:20:26.948 --> 01:20:28.115
Thank you.

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:35.039
I led a foolish life.

01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:38.125
So, I cannot see
as much as others.

01:20:40.086 --> 01:20:41.629
That is enough.

01:21:07.238 --> 01:21:11.409
It's $3 for a bag.
What would you like?

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:47.862
Rice puffs again?

01:22:04.545 --> 01:22:06.172
You bitch!

01:22:06.339 --> 01:22:09.091
What bastard did you
go and fuck!

01:22:09.634 --> 01:22:11.677
Shut up
if you don't wanna starve.

01:22:12.053 --> 01:22:14.180
We're living like this
cuz you borrowed that money.

01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:19.185
What? I didn't do it
just for me.

01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:25.274
Bitch! It's all your fault!

01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:28.027
Get lost, you bitch!

01:22:32.156 --> 01:22:35.451
If you doubt me so much,
you go and make money!

01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:38.329
You bitch!

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:46.754
Shit!

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:09.026
Where's my mom?

01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:12.321
The hell! You had a mom?

01:23:14.115 --> 01:23:15.324
Then, why the act!

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:18.244
Cuz I'm scared.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:25.167
I can't even move! See!

01:23:30.297 --> 01:23:31.257
Wait!

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:35.261
Beer money?

01:23:45.271 --> 01:23:46.188
Don't need it!

01:23:46.439 --> 01:23:47.523
The devil's money!

01:23:53.821 --> 01:23:58.993
If there was no law,
I'd kill you a hundred times!

01:24:03.998 --> 01:24:05.332
You piece of shit!

01:24:06.459 --> 01:24:08.753
Wish I can grind you
with my car!

01:24:33.486 --> 01:24:35.529
I got $40! Shit.

01:24:36.322 --> 01:24:37.073
Retard!

01:26:26.307 --> 01:26:30.477
<i>$5,000 BECAME $50,000.
I'LL BECOME A CRIPPLE TODAY</i>

01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:35.649
<i>WHAT IS MONEY? LIFE? DEATH?
I'M SORRY MOM</i>

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:55.062
Why'd you do it?

01:27:56.563 --> 01:27:58.607
Why were you so cruel?

01:28:04.113 --> 01:28:06.282
I cannot forgive you.

01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:12.037
You're a devil who tests
people with money.

01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:18.752
Now, you feel the heartache
as them.

01:28:20.337 --> 01:28:23.966
Watch your family die
before your very eyes!

01:28:30.931 --> 01:28:32.975
No use crying now.

01:28:34.768 --> 01:28:36.395
Pathetic fool.

01:28:37.938 --> 01:28:39.565
Devilish bastard!

01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:14.391
What is it?

01:29:33.243 --> 01:29:34.495
The hell!

01:29:35.954 --> 01:29:36.997
The fuck!

01:29:38.415 --> 01:29:39.166
Mom?

01:29:39.917 --> 01:29:40.667
Mom!

01:29:40.834 --> 01:29:42.086
You bitch!

01:29:42.795 --> 01:29:43.629
Mom!

01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:49.927
Mom!

01:29:54.014 --> 01:29:55.140
Get lost, bitch!

01:30:05.526 --> 01:30:06.360
Mom!

01:31:39.036 --> 01:31:40.370
Sang-go?

01:31:42.289 --> 01:31:44.082
You waited long, right?

01:31:46.793 --> 01:31:49.421
The fool's soul will die now.

01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:53.634
When I die before his eyes...

01:31:55.844 --> 01:31:59.306
he'll be in dire pain
over losing his family.

01:32:00.557 --> 01:32:02.643
He'll go crazy.

01:32:07.981 --> 01:32:09.149
But...

01:32:14.863 --> 01:32:17.824
Why am I so sad?

01:32:24.373 --> 01:32:26.500
Sang-go! I'm sorry.

01:32:30.837 --> 01:32:33.298
I didn't intend to feel this.

01:32:39.429 --> 01:32:41.223
But I feel sorry for him.

01:32:45.185 --> 01:32:47.187
Poor Kang-do!

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.499
Mom! Where are you?

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:08.917
Mom!

01:33:10.294 --> 01:33:11.169
Mom!

01:33:11.503 --> 01:33:12.504
Kang-do!

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:16.133
Don't come up!

01:33:16.592 --> 01:33:17.801
Please don't kill me!

01:33:17.843 --> 01:33:20.512
No! You son of a bitch!

01:33:21.138 --> 01:33:24.308
Let Mom go!
What do you want!

01:33:24.891 --> 01:33:26.226
Mom didn't do anything!

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.228
Kill me instead!

01:33:28.353 --> 01:33:30.897
Kang-do! I'm scared!

01:33:31.982 --> 01:33:35.235
Forgive me! Please!
Don't kill me!

01:33:35.861 --> 01:33:37.279
Kang-do! I'm scared!

01:33:37.571 --> 01:33:39.865
No! Mom! No!

01:33:42.034 --> 01:33:43.243
I was wrong!

01:33:43.785 --> 01:33:46.246
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:33:46.872 --> 01:33:48.373
I'll die instead!

01:33:48.832 --> 01:33:51.209
Let Mom go! Please!

01:33:52.044 --> 01:33:55.756
I'll die! Mom is innocent!

01:33:56.006 --> 01:33:58.091
Kill me! I'm sorry!

01:33:58.091 --> 01:33:59.593
Kill me, please!

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:02.095
Let Mom go! Please!

01:34:02.763 --> 01:34:07.142
I'm so sorry!
Please don't kill Mom!

01:34:08.685 --> 01:34:11.980
Please forgive me.
She didn't do anything.

01:34:12.397 --> 01:34:13.774
It's my fault.

01:34:14.441 --> 01:34:18.820
Forgive me.
And please let my...

01:34:19.655 --> 01:34:22.616
Please let my mom go.
Kill me.

01:34:22.949 --> 01:34:24.117
Please let her go.

01:34:27.913 --> 01:34:30.707
Please don't harm her.
I'm sorry.

01:34:31.124 --> 01:34:33.543
I am to blame.

01:34:34.378 --> 01:34:36.213
Please don't kill her.

01:34:48.308 --> 01:34:49.309
Sang-go?

01:34:51.395 --> 01:34:53.355
You're not alone anymore.

01:35:23.343 --> 01:35:24.511
Mom!
