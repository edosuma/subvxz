- Does mine smell like a one?

- Oh, yeah, they're all ones.
- Does yours smell like a one?

03:21.703 --> 03:22.911

how you do things around here.

04:52.595 --> 04:54.605
Now I know.

04:54.730 --> 04:58.173
Travis, it was just...
it was a special occasion.

04:58.339 --> 05:02.135
Uh, a deal I made
to boost office morale.

05:02.301 --> 05:04.638
Oh?
And what was the deal?

05:04.804 --> 05:06.849
We just had to give her fives.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.684
High... Fives.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.412
High fives, Travis,

05:10.537 --> 05:12.479
because there is nothing
that boosts my morale

05:12.645 --> 05:14.064
more than getting some skin.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.759
Up high!

05:15.884 --> 05:17.943
You're not getting that raise.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.497
No, Travis,
I already booked my package

05:19.622 --> 05:20.737
to Playa Del Carmen.

05:21.290 --> 05:24.950
Travis, I earned this raise
and I deserve this vacation.

05:25.116 --> 05:29.580

take the rest of the week off?

05:30.832 --> 05:32.075

on the situation.

take the rest of your life

around here.

06:39.557 --> 06:42.235
By the way, you are 32 minutes late,

06:42.401 --> 06:43.703
which means you will
start getting paid

06:43.828 --> 06:45.638
- at the top of the next hour.
- Are we?

06:45.763 --> 06:47.032
- Yes.
- Wait, what?

06:47.198 --> 06:48.825
You're not the boss of us.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.443
Oh, I am...

06:50.568 --> 06:52.496
Till I find Alice's replacement.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.457

some changes around here.

about the lush greenery.

- I told you to move the wall.

07:15.193 --> 07:17.145

All right, Jesse!

07:22.433 --> 07:23.743
Appreciate you rinsing your hair out.

07:23.868 --> 07:25.362
It was just a sanitary matter.

07:25.528 --> 07:26.988
It was a silly hairdo anyway.

07:27.154 --> 07:28.481
Now you won't be ruining
those headsets

- No, I can see him.
- Oh, you can see me.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.093
I'm, like, just
literally ten feet away.

07:57.218 --> 07:59.512
Eww! Your hands are so hairy, bro.

07:59.637 --> 08:01.647
You're disgusting,
you're a disgusting human.

the storage closet, right?

08:43.847 --> 08:46.359
- Yes.
- Okay.

08:46.525 --> 08:50.029
- You's about to get zippo'd!
- Oh, man!

08:50.154 --> 08:51.898
- Look what I brought.
- I missed you!

08:52.023 --> 08:54.600
I know, I've honestly
missed you a lot too.

08:54.725 --> 08:56.620
Is it...
it's been too long, dude.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.371
- It has.
- Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

08:58.537 --> 08:59.664
I took a pee in one of those bushes

08:59.830 --> 09:01.975
- just like you did.
- Nice! Get in here!

09:02.100 --> 09:03.709
I missed you too.
Honestly I have.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.245
- I'm trying to be you.
- I didn't think I would.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.213
- But I did.
- Let's smoke about it.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.739
Yeah, we're gonna smoke about it.

09:11.442 --> 09:14.354
I don't know what you were
planning on doing in here,

09:14.479 --> 09:17.974
but I'm betting it didn't
involve making sales calls.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.525
Uh...

09:19.650 --> 09:20.960
it depends on what you mean
by "sales calls."

09:21.085 --> 09:22.628
- We could try.
- Let's hit the phones!

09:22.753 --> 09:24.888
Hmm?

09:29.860 --> 09:32.095
And stop flipping me off.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.492
How does he see that?
That was incredible.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.010
- Gosh.
- That's an amazing skill set.

09:37.135 --> 09:39.645
I hate this dude, man.

09:39.770 --> 09:41.680
I guess I'll just see you guys
in there, all right?

09:41.805 --> 09:43.792
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.386
Okay?
We're the bash bros!

09:46.511 --> 09:48.588
Let's bash this fool,
catch him slipping.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.390
We do need to catch him
slipping, but he doesn't slip.

09:50.515 --> 09:52.342
It's like he's wearing
shoes for crews, man.

09:52.616 --> 09:53.626
Guys, I got an idea.

09:53.751 --> 09:55.094
Look, I got this app on my phone

09:55.219 --> 09:56.629
where you can record people's voices

09:56.754 --> 09:58.131
and then edit it around

09:58.256 --> 09:59.641
so they say things
that they didn't even say.

09:59.807 --> 10:01.067
- Can that work?
- Whoa.

10:01.192 --> 10:02.644
- You tell me.
- Welcome to the future.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.521
[Blake's voice, mechanically]
My favorite meal

10:04.687 --> 10:08.207
is butt salad with extra butt.

10:08.332 --> 10:09.976
- Eww!
- What?

10:10.101 --> 10:11.677
Whoa, extra butt.

10:11.802 --> 10:13.512
- No, I don't like butt salad.
- Ew, you nasty, boy.

10:13.637 --> 10:14.739
Apparently you do.

10:14.905 --> 10:17.117
My favorite salad is Asian salad.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.918
- Asian salad is good.
- Mm-hmm.

10:19.043 --> 10:20.320
- Butt-dorf.
- Butt salad?

10:20.445 --> 10:21.199
You don't know what it tastes like.

10:21.324 --> 10:22.768
- Could be delicious.
- It's right there.

10:22.893 --> 10:24.040
- Yeah.
- Which is crazy.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.992
That is crazy, how close it is.

10:26.117 --> 10:27.293
Butt salad and Asian salad?

10:27.418 --> 10:29.362
No, butt salad and vagina salad.

10:29.487 --> 10:31.431
Oh, I'll mess with that.

10:31.556 --> 10:33.049
Yeah, I'll mess
with some of that salad.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.175
Cool?

10:34.341 --> 10:35.302
Wait, why do you have that?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.136
Well, it's for, like,
a future situation

10:37.261 --> 10:38.597
in case I need to blackmail you guys.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.606
I love future situations.

10:40.731 --> 10:42.108
Those are, like, my favorite.

10:42.233 --> 10:43.443
Out of all sitches,
those are my favorite.

10:43.568 --> 10:45.103
- Play mine.
- Sure.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.779
[Adam's voice]
In middle school,

10:46.904 --> 10:48.982
I tricked this homeless dude
I bought weed from

10:49.148 --> 10:50.350
into walking into traffic,

10:50.475 --> 10:52.218
and when he got hit by a cement truck

10:52.343 --> 10:54.187
I just took off on my bike.

10:54.312 --> 10:55.855
- Oh, my God!
- That sounded real.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.033
Oh, my God.
How did you make me say that?

10:58.199 --> 11:00.259
Oh, no, that one was just
a drunk voicemail

11:00.384 --> 11:02.120
that you left me a while back, yeah.

11:02.386 --> 11:04.297
[Exhales sharply]

11:04.422 --> 11:06.065
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.

11:06.190 --> 11:07.626
- Very cool, very cool.
- Thank you, thank you.

11:07.891 --> 11:09.369
Also could we delete that?

11:09.494 --> 11:11.796
'cause I could go to prison
for something like that.

11:13.598 --> 11:15.475
All right.
You got this, Ders.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.343
- Okay, once again...
- Stop.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.112
The sentence we agreed on

11:19.237 --> 11:20.546
was "I will force her to the ground

11:20.671 --> 11:22.681
- and bury my dick in her."
- Got it.

11:22.806 --> 11:24.750
Say all that
and we'll have his balls...

11:24.875 --> 11:25.981
By the balls, I guess.

11:26.106 --> 11:27.520
We'll have his balls by the balls.

11:27.645 --> 11:28.980
That's the best way, all wrapped up.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.983
- [Knock at door]
- Come on in!

11:32.650 --> 11:33.792
Travis.

11:33.917 --> 11:35.070
Man, how are you?

11:35.236 --> 11:37.197
Um, look, I was just in here

11:37.363 --> 11:39.698
to ask you about
some sales techniques,

11:39.823 --> 11:42.160
because, you know,
real recognize real.

11:42.326 --> 11:45.338
So I'm gonna ask you
how you prefer to call.

11:45.463 --> 11:47.940
'cause I'm more of a smooth operator.

11:48.065 --> 11:50.543
Um, but I was wondering
if you believed in

11:50.668 --> 11:53.880
using brute, um,

11:54.172 --> 11:56.257
- uh, like brute...
- force?

11:56.423 --> 11:57.884
Force! Yes!
Perfect.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.019
And, uh, also there was a name

12:00.144 --> 12:01.930
that I was seeing on the list.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.389
And I couldn't figure out
how to pronounce it.

12:03.514 --> 12:09.429
So I'll just write it here.
You know.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.231
Barry McCockiner.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.066
Yes!
That's...

12:13.191 --> 12:15.360
Gotta be how you pronounce it,
thank you.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.271
I can't believe
we went with that cliche.

12:18.396 --> 12:19.672
Barry McCockiner?

12:19.797 --> 12:21.807
- [Scoffs]
- That's weak, dude.

12:21.932 --> 12:23.109
I know, I know.

12:23.234 --> 12:24.643
And I just thought of a good one.

12:24.768 --> 12:25.787
Like, just now.

12:26.036 --> 12:27.246
I've been thinking of great ones

12:27.371 --> 12:28.747
ever since he went in there.

12:28.872 --> 12:32.409
Yeah, but it's too late now, right?

12:34.712 --> 12:35.964
I did that earlier.

12:36.130 --> 12:40.059
It's something-town Julie brown.

12:40.184 --> 12:42.517
And I know it's not uptown,
'cause I would remember that.

12:42.642 --> 12:43.722
It's like...
[Phone vibrating]

12:44.422 --> 12:46.765
Uh...
[Laughing]

12:46.890 --> 12:49.102
Down.
Thanks for the help.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.736
Okay, psst.
Ders.

12:50.861 --> 12:52.605
- Ders, if you can hear me...
- Appreciate it.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.149
- Forget Barry McCockiner, Ders.
- I'm gonna go.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.692
- Wait.
- We're going with Yerpa.

12:55.858 --> 12:56.976
- First name Yerpa.
- Shh!

12:57.101 --> 12:58.478
C. Stinks.
Yerpa C. Stinks.

12:58.603 --> 12:59.812
- You get it?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:59.937 --> 13:01.906
Or try Ivana Jizinu.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.317
Uh, it's a Russian-Japanese
girl, if he asks.

13:04.442 --> 13:06.119
- Ivana Jizinu.
- Ivana.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.121
Hit him with the Ivana first.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.556
Yeah, we just felt like
Barry McCockiner

13:10.681 --> 13:12.492
has been, like, played out
a little bit.

13:12.617 --> 13:14.294
Like, I felt like
I've seen it places.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.862
- Ders?
- Gentlemen!

13:16.987 --> 13:20.399
Please join us in my office.

13:20.524 --> 13:22.735
Sorry.

13:22.860 --> 13:23.928
Yes.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.939
{pub}I am gonna take
my boss hat off for a second,

13:35.105 --> 13:37.792
because at the end of the day...

13:37.917 --> 13:39.569
We're all just men, right?

13:39.735 --> 13:41.295
- Ha. Yeah, don't...
- yeah.

13:41.420 --> 13:42.764
Don't let the hair fool ya.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.450
[Laughing]
'cause of your longer... yes.

13:45.616 --> 13:46.951
So let's try and act like men.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.579
Quit sneaking around my office,

13:49.745 --> 13:52.006
playing little games.

13:52.131 --> 13:53.333
That's not what men do.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.043
And I know...

13:55.209 --> 13:57.629
Because I am a real man.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.906
- Yeah.
- Yes.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.094
Do you see what I mean?

14:07.012 --> 14:08.056
Not even that big, right?

14:08.614 --> 14:10.724
- Very average-size.
- Surprisingly.

14:10.849 --> 14:12.193
- 'cause you're tall.
- Yeah, 'cause you're a big man.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.062
You'd think it'd be...

14:14.228 --> 14:15.605
but at least
I'm putting it out there.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.023
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, you are.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.816
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you are.

14:18.982 --> 14:21.903
Now... Are you guys real men?

14:22.028 --> 14:23.696
- Yeah.
- Are you?

14:23.862 --> 14:25.823
- Yeah.
- Totally, yeah.

14:25.989 --> 14:29.327
Then whip it out.

14:29.493 --> 14:32.121
Get your dick outta your pants now!

14:32.287 --> 14:34.315
Are you men or not?

14:34.440 --> 14:35.416
Show it!

14:35.942 --> 14:38.294
- No.
- That's what I figured.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.837
Now...

14:40.003 --> 14:42.623
Let's finish the day strong, okay?

14:42.748 --> 14:45.468
Make some sales, hmm?

14:45.634 --> 14:47.387
All right.
Yeah.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.796
- Yes.
- Okay, good.

14:48.921 --> 14:51.391
- Get back to work.
- Get back to work.

14:57.529 --> 14:58.898
What do you think you're doing?

14:59.598 --> 15:01.025
My hair.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.403
Well, you better rinse it out
before Travis sees it!

15:03.569 --> 15:05.103
What's happening here?

15:05.696 --> 15:07.532
This is not the Telamericorp
that I used to know.

15:07.698 --> 15:11.285

15:11.410 --> 15:14.080
Where's all the smiles, the giggling?

Can somebody tell me
where the giggling at, huh?

through that door.

this place is sorry!

16:22.815 --> 16:25.226
Well, she just got marked for death.

16:25.351 --> 16:28.095
I'm gonna throw that cage
off the roof.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.531
No, no, no, no, no.
I got a better idea.

16:30.697 --> 16:33.326
Maybe we should rattle Travis' cage.

what you want, all right?

17:52.278 --> 17:53.781
We didn't do anything.
It wasn't us.

17:53.947 --> 17:56.117
I need to apologize to you guys.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.493
I done fricked up, okay?

17:57.659 --> 17:59.160
I turned my back on you,

17:59.453 --> 18:02.096
and I let Travis
take advantage of my innocence.

No, eggs are baby birds.

18:07.294 --> 18:09.672
No, eggs are baby chickens.

18:09.838 --> 18:10.715
Everyone's wrong.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.308
Guys, he's been recording
your every move.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.261
Okay, there's cameras in the plants.

18:15.769 --> 18:18.146
And he put me in charge
of surveillance.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.182
I'm so, so, so...
I'm so, so, so, so sorry.

18:21.307 --> 18:23.186
Whoa! She's not kidding.
There's a tiny camera in here.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.521
- Oh, my God.
- Feel like a tattle rat.

18:25.687 --> 18:26.821
Oh, my gosh.

18:26.946 --> 18:28.356
If Earth Pets saw footage

18:28.481 --> 18:29.658
of that dude duck hunting
those birds out there,

18:29.783 --> 18:31.159
they would be pissed!

18:31.284 --> 18:32.987
We need your help
and Jet Set's hair cream.

18:33.153 --> 18:35.406
- [Banging]
- Coming in, Trav.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.432
We're here to tell you you're
about to get a video chat call

18:37.557 --> 18:38.833
from the people at Earth Pets.

18:39.117 --> 18:41.169
Yeah, I guess they got
some surveillance video

18:41.294 --> 18:44.373
of a certain executive
shooting birds.

18:44.539 --> 18:45.750
Hmm, that'd be crazy.

18:46.065 --> 18:47.208
And I wouldn't say
they didn't like it...

18:47.333 --> 18:49.010
Because they didn't not like it.

18:49.135 --> 18:53.132
'cause they loved hating it
and not liking it at all.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.426
Wha...
[Computer chiming]

18:55.592 --> 18:56.761
Oh, you might wanna answer that.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.596
"Oh, no, I'm fired."

18:59.862 --> 19:01.682
Travis Rockne
of T.A.C. here.

19:01.906 --> 19:04.143
Hi, Travis.
Bridget McCarthy of Earth Pets.

19:04.441 --> 19:06.019
Hello, Bridget.

19:06.144 --> 19:07.787
I was told you've taken over
for Alice Murphy.

19:07.912 --> 19:09.388
Temporarily.

19:09.513 --> 19:11.190
Alice has moved on
to greener pastures and I'm...

19:11.315 --> 19:13.083
- [Sneeze]
- In the process of looking...

19:15.278 --> 19:17.448
At... for her, uh, replacement.

19:17.722 --> 19:19.098
Well, I hate to tell you this,

19:19.223 --> 19:20.633
but we don't wanna work
with a replacement.

19:20.758 --> 19:23.120
And we surely don't wanna work
with you either.

19:23.286 --> 19:26.172
Bridget, you know how
we value your... your business.

19:26.297 --> 19:28.107
Okay, well, get Alice Murphy back

19:28.232 --> 19:30.169
or you won't have our business,
bird killer!

19:30.335 --> 19:32.270
Bird killer!

19:34.105 --> 19:36.315
You see our dicks, right?

19:36.440 --> 19:38.117
Mine's getting cold,
so I'm gonna put it away.

19:38.242 --> 19:39.719
- Yeah, it's a little cold.
- You keep it cold in here.

19:39.844 --> 19:41.153
Very chilly!

19:41.278 --> 19:42.488
So they're not as big
as they should be.

19:42.613 --> 19:44.090
- Very chilly.
- But they were out.

19:44.215 --> 19:46.143
Let it be known
they're out, we're men.

19:46.309 --> 19:47.513
- So...
- okay.

19:49.353 --> 19:51.130
- [Laughter]
- That's right, bitches.

19:51.255 --> 19:52.565
I'm back.

19:52.690 --> 19:54.734
What is that piss smell in here?

19:54.859 --> 19:56.135
- Jillian.
- Hi! Good to see you.

19:56.260 --> 19:57.670
- You look great.
- Shut up.

19:57.795 --> 19:59.031
- I'd love to.
- Couple of things.

19:59.197 --> 20:01.492
I need you to confirm my flight
to Playa Del Carmen.

20:01.799 --> 20:04.110
And I need you to find
those little birds.

20:04.235 --> 20:06.580
I gotta do a video chat
with Earth Pets in a second.

20:06.971 --> 20:10.249
Oh, uh, well, Alice...

20:10.374 --> 20:12.712
actually, we kind of still have them.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.463
We're just glad
to have you back, Alice.

20:14.629 --> 20:16.465
- [Whistling]
- Well, uh, Bridget,

20:16.631 --> 20:17.591
- I just can't wait...
- Ba-caw!

20:17.757 --> 20:19.592
To be getting back, and I promise

20:19.717 --> 20:21.137
I'll contact you next week,
okay, gal pal?

20:21.303 --> 20:22.888
- Ba-caw!
- See you later. Bye!

20:23.054 --> 20:24.563
- Okay.
- Ba-caw!

20:24.688 --> 20:25.766
Okay, okay, okay.
We're done.

20:25.932 --> 20:27.435
- Yeah.
- She's gone.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.668
Cool.

20:28.793 --> 20:30.169
Hey, Alice, uh,
the lady on your computer,

20:30.294 --> 20:33.039
- she's not wrong.
- That's really nice.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.609
Now why don't you get these
goddamn dead birds off of me...

20:35.775 --> 20:36.776
- Sure.
- And get back to work?

20:36.901 --> 20:37.611
- Sorry.
- How about that?

20:37.777 --> 20:38.821
I'm gonna keep this one.

20:38.987 --> 20:39.780
- It was fun.
- Oh, hey.

20:39.946 --> 20:41.324
Can we get our airsoft guns back?

20:41.490 --> 20:43.082
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.
No problem.

20:43.207 --> 20:45.752
Thank you.
[All talking]

20:45.877 --> 20:47.371
[All screaming]

20:47.678 --> 20:48.873
Whoa!
Whoa!

20:49.346 --> 20:50.624
Yeah!

20:52.449 --> 20:54.253
God, I wish this was real.
