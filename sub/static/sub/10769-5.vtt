00:03.203 --> 00:07.606
Will, I'm ready. You said you'd teach me
one of your basketball tricks.

00:07.974 --> 00:11.375
Oh, well, you know,
my moves are kind of like top secret, Nick.

00:11.544 --> 00:15.412
I mean, I could show you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.782
Okay.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.715
Well, maybe I'll make an exception
this one time, all right?

00:20.887 --> 00:22.514
All right. Come on. D me up, D me up.

00:25.458 --> 00:26.550
All right, check it out.

00:26.726 --> 00:29.718
Now, this is called the Will Smith
Hoop Dream, Dunk on Hakeem...

00:29.896 --> 00:33.696
...Down the Lane, House of Pain pass.
I see you wasn't ready for that one.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.665
Back in Philly, they used to call me
Will "The 747" Smith.

00:37.303 --> 00:38.327
- Wanna know why?
- Why?

00:43.176 --> 00:45.201
Because I'm about to jet.

02:03.623 --> 02:07.855
This weekend? Oh, I'd love to, Thad,
but I'm gonna lay low.

02:08.026 --> 02:11.224
Oh, no, it's nothing serious, just the flu.

02:11.831 --> 02:15.289
Oh, that's so sweet. Okay, bye.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.770
Thad? I thought you were dating Kyle.

02:18.938 --> 02:20.769
I am. He's the flu.

02:21.674 --> 02:24.507
- Go, girl.
- You see what I'm saying?

02:24.677 --> 02:26.907
It sounds like it's raining men.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.770
I hope y'all are taking notes.

02:28.948 --> 02:32.645
Hey, hey, hey, stop being all freaky.

02:34.387 --> 02:36.855
Hi, Will. What you doing?

02:37.023 --> 02:39.548
Five to ten
if you don't take your hands off me.

02:43.963 --> 02:46.727
Hill, what you think?
You did a pretty good show today, huh?

02:46.900 --> 02:50.267
Three words: Stink. Stank. Stunk.

02:50.436 --> 02:52.370
It was the worst show
we have ever done.

02:52.539 --> 02:53.665
We need better guests.

02:53.840 --> 02:58.209
Wait, wait. Don't be getting all mad at me.
I'm just the assistant talent coordinator.

02:58.378 --> 03:01.779
If I had some more responsibility,
maybe we'd have some better guests.

03:01.948 --> 03:04.007
Then get me someone great
for tomorrow's show.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.017
And if it were my responsibility,
then I'd do it.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.018
Okay, I'm telling you to do it.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.818
All right, and if I thought you meant it,
then I'd get it done.

03:13.393 --> 03:16.385
That's right,
my baby can definitely get it done.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.760
Don't make me turn the hose on you,
all right?

03:22.502 --> 03:26.336
Will, I need more stimulating guests. I need
someone who can hold my attention...

03:26.506 --> 03:29.441
...for more than three seconds.
- All right. How about we get...?

03:29.609 --> 03:31.338
I gotta go.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.942
Hey. Uncle Phil, what's going on, man?

03:40.153 --> 03:42.815
Would you like to buy a vowel?

03:45.692 --> 03:49.355
You know, this trial is gonna be the death
of me. We lost another juror today.

03:49.529 --> 03:52.430
Oh, really?
Hey, did you check under your robe?

03:56.402 --> 03:58.802
I can see you're not in the mood for that
right now.

03:58.972 --> 04:02.373
Here. Come on. Right here. Right here.
So come on, man. What happened?

04:02.542 --> 04:03.668
He was writing a book.

04:03.843 --> 04:07.472
The bailiff found him hiding
in the men's room with his laptop.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.912
You sure he wasn't just
downloading his floppy?

04:13.586 --> 04:15.816
- Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
- Ha-ha-ha!

04:15.989 --> 04:18.514
Shut up. Can you hear me?

04:21.494 --> 04:24.224
Hi, I'm Carlton Banks,
and I joined Great Introductions...

04:24.397 --> 04:28.561
...to give you red-hot mamas a chance
to take a walk on the wild side.

04:28.735 --> 04:30.066
So climb on board.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.803
Hm. A tad forward.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.479
I am tan, I am a tourist...

04:41.648 --> 04:47.280
<i>...and I'd love to give a lucky mademoiselle
like you a chance to meet moi.</i>

04:48.221 --> 04:49.654
That felt close.

04:55.194 --> 04:56.491
Do you guys mind?

04:57.030 --> 05:00.158
What is your problem, Pepe Le Puny?

05:01.934 --> 05:03.834
Hardy har har.

05:04.504 --> 05:05.664
<i>And in a related story...</i>

05:05.838 --> 05:09.740
<i>... Judge Philip Banks has dismissed yet
another juror in the Show-Biz Madam Case.</i>

05:09.909 --> 05:14.005
<i>As cameras are not allowed in his courtroom
we have an artist's rendering of his action.</i>

05:14.180 --> 05:19.117
<i>Specific details are not yet available
as to why the juror was dismissed.</i>

05:19.352 --> 05:21.286
Wait, I know that guy.

05:21.454 --> 05:24.855
Of course you do.
That's my Dad, you half-life.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.188
- Not him, the other dude.
- Oh, what, you knew him?

05:28.361 --> 05:29.794
He's my barber.

05:29.962 --> 05:33.261
The dude that cut that jack-o'- lantern
in your head last Halloween?

05:33.766 --> 05:34.926
That's the guy.

05:35.101 --> 05:38.434
It'd have been great if that candle
hadn't burned the roof of my mouth.

05:41.374 --> 05:44.400
Jazz, do you think he'd do Hilary?

05:45.011 --> 05:47.502
Why not? She got a nice big head.

05:52.819 --> 05:58.451
This place is so tiny. I can't even imagine
how small the facial room must be.

05:58.624 --> 06:01.559
Hill, why don't you come on over here
and sit down? Here you go.

06:01.728 --> 06:04.993
<i>Read this Jet magazine
and let me handle my business, all right?</i>

06:05.164 --> 06:08.327
- Okay, you're next.
- Hey. Whoa, hey.

06:09.102 --> 06:12.196
Now, you know I'm gonna have to charge
you extra for working around these ears.

06:13.906 --> 06:17.603
Well, no, hold up, my man.
Actually, I'm not here to get a haircut.

06:17.777 --> 06:20.007
Well, you in the wrong place, fool.

06:20.580 --> 06:23.208
Well, no, a friend of mine sent me.
You know Jazz?

06:23.883 --> 06:26.647
The idiot that put the candle
in his mouth?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.620
- That's him.
- All right, now, what can I do you for?

06:29.789 --> 06:32.917
- Well, see, actually, my cousin and l...
- Will, let me handle this.

06:33.092 --> 06:37.324
Hi. As you probably already know,
I'm Hilary Banks.

06:37.497 --> 06:39.021
Who?

06:39.432 --> 06:41.900
Ha, ha! That's very funny.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.731
I would be really honored
if you would be a guest on my show.

06:46.406 --> 06:50.001
What is it with you people?
First, you got Geraldo coming in here...

06:50.176 --> 06:54.135
...you know his head is as empty
as Al Capone's vault, then you had Montel.

06:54.313 --> 06:57.612
I told Montel, "Yeah, I'll do your show
when you grow some hair."

06:58.651 --> 07:01.347
Now, listen, I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told them.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.853
I'm not interested
in doing tabloid television.

07:04.023 --> 07:06.150
I have my dignity
and I have my self-respect.

07:06.325 --> 07:08.054
- We got cash.
- You got George.

07:08.528 --> 07:09.961
Oh!

07:10.863 --> 07:12.990
Carlton, can I use your car on Saturday?

07:13.166 --> 07:15.191
No can do, Ashley. I have a date.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.367
You're kidding. With who?

07:22.775 --> 07:27.144
Well, I haven't worked that part out yet.
But once this dating-service thing kicks in...

07:27.313 --> 07:29.838
...this hombre's dance card
is gonna be pretty full.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.778
Oh, yeah, just yuk it up.

07:35.354 --> 07:38.812
He who laughs last...
See, it's started already.

07:38.991 --> 07:41.516
- Master Carlton...
- Not now, Geoffrey.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.454
"You're in my thoughts. Love, Thad."

07:44.630 --> 07:46.154
Thad?

07:46.332 --> 07:48.630
That's a pretty sexy-sounding name.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.395
I'm thinking long legs.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.766
No, these are for me from Thad.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.737
Now what am I supposed to do?

07:55.908 --> 07:59.344
Please, for carnations
and a little baby's breath? Nothing.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.917
Hey. Hey, Carlton, you will never guess
who we got on the show for tomorrow.

08:06.085 --> 08:08.519
So there's no sense of me playing,
is there?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.350
Hey, Uncle Phil,
about that juror you just...

08:14.527 --> 08:17.462
- I'm sorry, Will, but I can't talk about it.
- Daddy, the juror...

08:17.630 --> 08:23.569
How many times do I have to tell you kids
that I just can't talk about it? Ugh!

08:25.805 --> 08:28.365
Hey, Nicky,
you will never guess who we got...

08:28.541 --> 08:32.841
How many times do I have to tell you kids?
I just can't talk about it.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.371
Ugh!

08:40.186 --> 08:42.711
Excuse me, I'm here to return this radio.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.880
Back of the line.

08:45.157 --> 08:47.955
Hey, aren't you Judge Banks?

08:48.127 --> 08:50.322
Well, yes, I am.

08:51.097 --> 08:53.531
Hey, everybody,
it's Judge Banks from the television.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.565
Hey.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.226
You think that show-biz madam did it
or what, huh?

08:58.404 --> 09:00.304
I'm sorry, but I can't discuss the case.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.140
Then I can't discuss your radio.
Back of the line.

09:10.616 --> 09:13.380
All right, why don't you just relax,
cool out a little bit?

09:13.553 --> 09:16.681
Hilary will be out soon.
How you feeling? You a little nervous?

09:16.856 --> 09:18.881
Why should I be nervous?
I'm all liquored up.

09:23.329 --> 09:25.854
You are hilarious, man.
Hey, have a seat. Have a seat.

09:26.032 --> 09:28.125
Listen, I just wanna let you that,
you know...

09:28.301 --> 09:31.099
...any point during the show
you feel like you might wanna...

09:31.270 --> 09:34.467
...I don't know, toss my name in,
"Will Smith," you know, it's cool.

09:35.374 --> 09:36.671
Okay. Ready, George?

09:36.842 --> 09:40.676
Of course, I'm ready. I've been waiting
around for an hour. Where's my money?

09:40.846 --> 09:43.178
Hey, look. All right.
I'm gonna be right over here.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.749
Remember, Will Smith. Will Smith.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.783
All right, everybody,
have a great show.

09:47.954 --> 09:49.046
Okay.

09:49.755 --> 09:53.623
Now, just relax, be yourself,
and remember to keep your answers short.

09:53.793 --> 09:56.626
The audience didn't come
to hear the guest babble on and on.

09:58.965 --> 10:01.763
In five, four, three, two...

10:03.836 --> 10:06.066
<i>Hello and welcome to Hilary.</i>

10:06.238 --> 10:08.433
We're very excited today
to have as our guest...

10:08.608 --> 10:13.409
...recently dismissed juror from the
Show-Biz Madam Trial, George Howlings.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.677
- Welcome.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

10:17.850 --> 10:21.843
Well, I guess what we're all dying to know
is why you were dismissed.

10:22.021 --> 10:25.320
You know, they told the press
I was writing a book, but that's not it.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.785
Oh?

10:27.193 --> 10:30.060
Tell us what it really was.

10:30.229 --> 10:33.687
Well, they said I was crazy,
but I'm not crazy.

10:33.866 --> 10:35.925
But you wanna know who is crazy?

10:36.102 --> 10:37.694
Maybe I shouldn't say this on TV.

10:37.870 --> 10:41.101
Oh, come on, George.
Just between you and me...

10:41.941 --> 10:43.909
...who was crazy?

10:44.076 --> 10:46.203
That lard-butt of a judge.

10:47.713 --> 10:50.147
That man is crazy as they come.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.451
<i>What does it take
to become a judge these days?</i>

10:53.619 --> 10:57.077
<i>Now, if you ask me,
that man was very incompetent.</i>

10:57.256 --> 10:59.349
<i>Couldn't judge a beauty pageant.</i>

10:59.525 --> 11:02.688
<i>About as useless as a no-mouthed dog
at a Frisbee contest.</i>

11:04.130 --> 11:07.395
<i>If I ever see him,
I'll lower him like a cheap carpet.</i>

11:10.936 --> 11:13.370
<i>And it looked to me,
he dozed off every now and then.</i>

11:13.539 --> 11:14.563
<i>George...</i>

11:14.740 --> 11:17.174
<i>Probably dreaming
about that bony-legged prosecutor.</i>

11:17.710 --> 11:20.440
<i>I think they got something going on.</i>

11:21.514 --> 11:23.812
<i>Ain't that right, Will Smith?</i>

11:35.327 --> 11:38.694
Hill. Hill. Hold up. He's gonna kill us.

11:38.864 --> 11:42.231
Will, it's not like it was our fault.
We can't control what someone says.

11:42.401 --> 11:44.926
Daddy will understand that.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.503
Well, I hope so.

11:46.672 --> 11:49.300
And if not,
I'll just blame the whole thing on you.

11:50.609 --> 11:53.169
Oops. Did I say that out loud?

11:54.680 --> 11:56.170
Is he in there?

11:56.348 --> 11:58.111
No, the coast is... Clear!

12:02.922 --> 12:05.618
Hi, Daddy. You look so handsome.

12:05.791 --> 12:09.386
Oh, not bad for a lard butt, huh?

12:10.796 --> 12:14.459
I guess there's no reason to ask
whether or not you saw the show today.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.863
Oh, I saw the show.

12:17.036 --> 12:19.095
We all saw the show.

12:19.839 --> 12:23.275
Wait, wait, hold up, Uncle Phil.
Now, before you get started...

12:23.442 --> 12:26.843
...I wanna let you know that finger pointing
isn't gonna get us nowhere.

12:27.880 --> 12:31.543
<i>And also that
it's not called The Will Show.</i>

12:32.885 --> 12:36.616
Oh, please. You're the one
that introduced me to that nut.

12:36.789 --> 12:40.316
Daddy, punish him. He needs tough love.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.591
That is enough.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.629
I have never been so embarrassed
in my entire life.

12:45.798 --> 12:49.928
And to think the two people
responsible for it are my own family.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.070
My own flesh and blood.

12:52.972 --> 12:54.303
Um...

12:54.473 --> 12:57.465
Technically, Uncle Phil,
I'm not really your flesh and blood.

12:59.979 --> 13:03.380
See, my Mom and Aunt Viv, they...

13:03.549 --> 13:06.450
I see where you going with this though.

13:06.852 --> 13:09.377
- Do you?
- Oh, yeah, I can see. Pssh-pssh!

13:10.689 --> 13:14.887
Then tell me, what is it?
Haven't I done enough for you?

13:15.060 --> 13:17.961
Taking you into my home, huh?
Treated you with respect.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.026
Maybe I did something to hurt you,
is that it?

13:21.867 --> 13:24.700
No. Come on, Uncle Phil.
No. No, that's not it.

13:25.171 --> 13:27.605
- Then why?
- I don't... I don't know.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.604
And you...

13:29.875 --> 13:31.536
...my own daughter.

13:31.710 --> 13:34.042
My first-born.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.375
I don't know if there's a knife
that could cut as deeply.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.350
We tried to tell you yesterday.

13:42.788 --> 13:45.951
That's your excuse?
You didn't have the sense to know that...

13:46.125 --> 13:48.593
...that man would be angry with me
for dismissing him?

13:48.761 --> 13:51.355
You didn't have the common sense
to know that?

13:51.530 --> 13:54.499
I don't have any common sense.

14:00.606 --> 14:04.940
You two have profoundly hurt
and disappointed me.

14:06.278 --> 14:09.475
Unc... Uncle... Uncle Ph... Unc...

14:10.649 --> 14:13.812
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

14:13.986 --> 14:16.955
Aunt... Aunt... Aunt...

14:17.122 --> 14:20.182
- A... Ashley.
- You understand, don't you?

14:23.929 --> 14:27.228
Nicky. Come on... Ow! Man.

14:28.934 --> 14:32.426
- Hill, you know what you gonna say?
- I'm just gonna speak from the heart.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.800
Hey, now just remember,
this is from both of us.

14:34.974 --> 14:37.670
Don't be out there taking all the credit.
Have a good show.

14:37.843 --> 14:43.406
Here we go.
In five seconds, four, three, two...

14:44.083 --> 14:46.347
<i>Hello and welcome to Hilary.</i>

14:46.785 --> 14:50.186
Today's show
is a very special tribute to fathers.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.187
But before we get to our guests...

14:52.358 --> 14:56.260
...I'd like to say something special
about a very important man in my life.

14:56.428 --> 14:59.920
My father, Judge Philip Banks.

15:04.803 --> 15:07.738
Yesterday, a dismissed juror
in the Show-Biz Madam Trial...

15:07.907 --> 15:12.537
...came on the show
and said some really icky things about him.

15:13.379 --> 15:18.578
My cousin Will and I were,
well, to say the least, shocked.

15:20.252 --> 15:23.949
<i>- And now Daddy won't even talk to us.
He won't say nothing.</i>

15:24.123 --> 15:27.024
<i>And we feel like strangers in our own house.</i>

15:27.192 --> 15:30.821
<i>Please, Daddy, forgive us. Please.</i>

15:31.664 --> 15:34.360
You should be ashamed of yourself.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.166
Ow!

15:38.804 --> 15:41.671
<i>And we don't know
what we supposed to do.</i>

15:49.515 --> 15:52.040
I'm sorry,
no one answered the front door.

15:52.217 --> 15:54.777
I have a package for a Carlton Banks.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.751
That's me.

15:56.922 --> 15:58.981
Oh, no, not another rejection.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.455
Bad news?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.890
I sent this to Last Chance Video Dating.

16:03.062 --> 16:08.329
You know, "We guarantee you a date,"
except if your name is Carlton Banks.

16:08.767 --> 16:12.601
Trust me. It doesn't work
if your name is Michelle Williams either.

16:12.771 --> 16:15.467
- You tried this?
- I tried them all.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.665
Wow.

16:16.842 --> 16:20.972
I wouldn't expect someone like you
to have trouble meeting people.

16:21.146 --> 16:25.105
The only people I meet
are dogs and shut-ins.

16:26.218 --> 16:27.276
Why can't it be easier?

16:27.453 --> 16:30.479
I mean, why can't you just open the door
and meet someone nice?

16:33.125 --> 16:34.353
Well, bye.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.659
Wait a minute.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.331
Would you?

16:41.500 --> 16:43.695
Uh... Uh...

16:43.869 --> 16:45.803
Like to go out Saturday night?

16:46.438 --> 16:47.462
Yeah.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.033
- Hey, I'm not...
- Coming on too strong?

16:51.643 --> 16:52.735
Not at all.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.242
Bye.

16:58.450 --> 17:02.477
Sweet mother of God,
that's a firm handshake.

17:04.256 --> 17:08.488
Trust me, if Daddy saw the show
this afternoon, everything will be fine.

17:08.660 --> 17:11.560
And if he didn't, we'll show it to him.

17:11.730 --> 17:14.290
Now, do you know how to work
one of these things?

17:14.465 --> 17:15.454
What are you two doing?

17:17.036 --> 17:19.664
Hey, man.

17:20.172 --> 17:23.699
Did you see anything,
I don't know, good on TV today?

17:23.876 --> 17:24.968
No.

17:25.144 --> 17:28.113
- So you didn't see the show?
- Oh, I saw the show.

17:28.280 --> 17:33.547
And now thanks to you, not only am I
an incompetent judge, but an unfit parent.

17:34.353 --> 17:36.480
Tell me, what do you have planned
for tomorrow?

17:36.655 --> 17:38.646
Perhaps snapshots of me
in the bathtub, huh?

17:38.824 --> 17:42.692
Or a video of me
chasing stray dogs in my car.

17:43.295 --> 17:45.889
Daddy, you don't do that, do you?

17:46.832 --> 17:49.767
You two are the most irresponsible...

17:49.935 --> 17:51.596
All right, I've heard enough.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.068
Now, I did see something good
on TV today.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.434
I saw two people
begging for forgiveness...

17:56.608 --> 17:59.509
...and feeling very badly
for hurting someone that they love.

17:59.678 --> 18:04.081
Oh, please, Vivian.
Don't buy into the propaganda.

18:04.983 --> 18:06.610
That's enough.

18:06.785 --> 18:09.583
Now, what I wanna hear now
is an apology...

18:09.755 --> 18:13.191
...and the acceptance of the apology.

18:14.359 --> 18:15.383
Go ahead.

18:15.994 --> 18:17.188
- We sorry.
- We're sorry.

18:17.362 --> 18:21.560
- We sorry, man. We sorry. Man, we sorry.
- We're really, really, really sorry, Daddy.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.758
Okay, now you.

18:25.904 --> 18:27.872
I accept your apology.

18:30.342 --> 18:32.173
Philip.

18:34.713 --> 18:36.237
I accept your apology.

18:36.415 --> 18:38.349
Okay.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.951
- Now hug. Come on.
- Ohh.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.159
Hold up. Hold up.

19:18.490 --> 19:22.620
This is the way it's supposed to be.
One big happy family.

19:22.794 --> 19:25.126
Uncle Phil, man,
I just wanna say again how sorry...

19:25.297 --> 19:28.664
Enough, enough said, Will. Enough.
Let's just put it all behind us.

19:28.834 --> 19:33.328
What's done is done.
I just wanna sit here and watch a little TV.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.167
<i>Anybody see
the Hilary show the other day?</i>

19:36.341 --> 19:38.775
<i>They had a dismissed juror
from the Show-Biz Madam Case...</i>

19:38.944 --> 19:42.607
<i>... insulting Judge Banks,
who just happens to be Hilary's father.</i>

19:42.781 --> 19:46.478
<i>Boy, here's a family that really puts
the "fun" back in dysfunctional, isn't it?</i>

19:51.690 --> 19:55.285
<i>Speaking of Judge Banks,
we have a special tribute to him tonight.</i>

19:55.460 --> 19:59.226
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome The Dancing Phils.</i>

20:04.002 --> 20:06.232
- That's it! I've had enough!
- But, wait...

20:06.405 --> 20:08.703
- Daddy...
- No, no. Just go. Just go. Please.

20:08.907 --> 20:11.034
- Ohh!
Go!

20:11.243 --> 20:14.644
Wait, wait a minute.
Now, you wait one minute, Uncle Phil.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.175
Now, I didn't wanna have to do this...

20:17.349 --> 20:19.544
...but you brought this on yourself.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.293
<i>And I am telling you</i>

20:32.197 --> 20:35.132
<i>I'm not going</i>

20:35.300 --> 20:39.236
<i>Even though the rough times are showing</i>

20:39.404 --> 20:44.774
<i>There's just no way, there's no way</i>

20:44.943 --> 20:48.470
<i>Tear down the mountains
Yell, scream and shout</i>

20:48.647 --> 20:51.639
<i>You can say what you want
I'm not walking out</i>

20:52.618 --> 20:55.781
<i>Stop all the rivers, push, strike and kill</i>

20:55.954 --> 21:01.950
<i>I'm not gonna leave you
There's no way I will</i>

21:02.127 --> 21:05.187
<i>And</i>

21:05.364 --> 21:12.361
<i>I am telling you</i>

21:12.604 --> 21:17.007
<i>I'm not going</i>

21:18.010 --> 21:21.810
<i>You're the best man I'll ever know</i>

21:21.980 --> 21:25.541
<i>There's no way I can ever, ever go</i>

21:25.717 --> 21:28.618
<i>No, no, no, no way</i>

21:28.787 --> 21:32.553
<i>No, no, no, no way I'm living without you</i>

21:32.724 --> 21:38.458
<i>Oh, I'm not living without you
Not living without you</i>

21:38.630 --> 21:41.861
<i>I don't wanna be free</i>

21:42.034 --> 21:43.626
<i>I'm staying</i>

21:43.802 --> 21:46.134
<i>I'm staying</i>

21:46.305 --> 21:49.001
<i>And you, and you, and you</i>

21:49.174 --> 21:50.971
<i>You're gonna...</i>

21:57.015 --> 22:00.314
<i>You're gonna love me</i>

22:01.305 --> 22:07.422
