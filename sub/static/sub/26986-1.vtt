<i>The Torrance Tornado smoked
the mile in four minutes, 21.3 seconds.</i>

01:08.900 --> 01:14.274
<i>Zamperini is now officially the fastest
high school runner in American history.</i>

01:43.536 --> 01:45.735
<i>This is the</i> Green Hornet.
<i>We're going down!</i>

01:45.737 --> 01:47.840
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

03:14.926 --> 03:17.560
Mr. Zamperini,
good morning.

03:17.562 --> 03:20.564
- Sightseeing today?
- No.

03:20.566 --> 03:22.467
Shall I call a taxi?

03:23.701 --> 03:25.501
There's no need.
I'll walk.

03:25.503 --> 03:27.406
Do you know the way?

03:28.407 --> 03:30.877
It's not my first time
in Tokyo.

04:03.842 --> 04:05.775
Mr. Zamperini?

04:05.777 --> 04:08.879
Robert Trumbull. Thank you for
allowing me to join you today.

04:08.881 --> 04:11.048
I was always a fan
of <i>Time</i> magazine.

04:11.050 --> 04:13.917
You know, my mother saw you
at the Olympics in '36.

04:13.919 --> 04:16.889
She was thrilled to hear
I'd be meeting with you.

04:20.959 --> 04:24.329
These men did
terrible things to you.

04:26.865 --> 04:28.668
What are you gonna
say to them?

05:10.776 --> 05:12.377
Where's Watanabe?

05:14.913 --> 05:16.581
Where's "The Bird"?

05:26.492 --> 05:29.459
All right, now... now
can we get out of the car?

05:29.461 --> 05:31.928
Hey!

05:31.930 --> 05:33.663
Oh!

05:41.072 --> 05:43.639
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma!
You're gonna kiss me to death.

05:43.641 --> 05:46.075
I can't believe that it's you
and that you're actually home.

05:46.077 --> 05:47.877
He's home, all right.

05:47.879 --> 05:51.180
We were so worried that you would
be all skinny and-and worn out.

05:51.182 --> 05:53.015
Oh, what, me?
No, I'm in great shape.

05:53.017 --> 05:54.683
Can you believe the army
told us you were dead?

05:54.685 --> 05:56.185
Yeah, so much
for military intelligence.

05:56.187 --> 05:58.087
The newspaper said
they hurt you.

05:58.089 --> 06:02.825
Mom, that was just the reporter making
stuff up to try and sell newspapers.

06:02.827 --> 06:06.096
Pop, you knew I was
comin' home, didn't you?

06:06.098 --> 06:08.432
- Yeah, of course.
- Of course!

06:08.434 --> 06:10.433
- Of course! We all did.
- Mm-hmm.

06:10.435 --> 06:12.702
Let's go.

06:15.540 --> 06:18.444
Don't step on the grass!

06:19.911 --> 06:21.610
- Come!
- Ah.

06:21.612 --> 06:23.014
You okay?

06:23.882 --> 06:26.651
Never been better.

06:27.819 --> 06:29.588
I'll see you inside.

06:33.524 --> 06:37.796
And thank you, Father,
for bringing our Louie home.

06:43.999 --> 06:44.166
Amen.

06:44.168 --> 06:47.139
Ah!

06:50.509 --> 06:53.075
Hmm. On the raft,
day after day,

06:53.077 --> 06:55.478
we were talking our heads
off, killing time.

06:55.480 --> 06:58.147
And I was always braggin'
about Ma's cooking.

06:58.149 --> 07:00.082
Yeah, and the guys, they would...

07:00.084 --> 07:03.486
They would make me describe every
dish, you know, every sauce,

07:03.488 --> 07:06.623
every pinch of spice, everything, all
the details, over and over again,

07:06.625 --> 07:07.658
every single day.

07:07.660 --> 07:10.493
- And you know what their favorite was, Ma?
- What?

07:10.495 --> 07:13.163
- Your gnocchi.
- Hey!

07:15.901 --> 07:17.500
What is this, Christmas?

07:17.502 --> 07:19.034
Every Christmas
since you've been gone.

07:19.036 --> 07:21.036
And all your birthdays.

07:21.038 --> 07:22.841
Three years' worth.
Here you go.

07:23.774 --> 07:25.509
What are these, hmm?

07:25.511 --> 07:28.945
Letters. 2,000 of them.

07:28.947 --> 07:30.813
And why are people
writing me letters?

07:30.815 --> 07:33.283
They want to know if you're going
to run in the London Olympics.

07:33.285 --> 07:35.084
You are a hero, Louie.

07:35.086 --> 07:37.853
They got me confused
with some other fellow, Ma.

07:37.855 --> 07:38.757
- Aw.
- I don't think so.

07:48.165 --> 07:50.735
- Cardarelli!
- Ah, Louise.

07:52.637 --> 07:54.271
- <i>Buona sera.</i>
- <i>Buona sera.</i>

07:54.273 --> 07:57.673
Louie! Louie, come talk
to Father Cardarelli.

07:59.278 --> 08:02.546
Thank you, Mama.
Mwah!

08:02.548 --> 08:05.682
Bless you, Louis.
Welcome home.

08:05.684 --> 08:08.685
- Thank you, Padre.
- All of Torrance was praying for your safe return.

08:08.687 --> 08:11.954
- Well, that's swell.
- It's a miracle you survived.

08:11.956 --> 08:15.892
Miracles didn't save my tail feathers,
Padre. A couple of atomic bombs did that.

08:15.894 --> 08:19.228
No. Don't discount
God's role in your journey.

08:19.230 --> 08:21.664
Don't worry, Padre.
I give him all the blame.

08:21.666 --> 08:23.699
Hey, Ma, they're playing
our favorite song. Come on!

08:23.701 --> 08:28.070
Louis, Louis. God's not to
blame for your suffering.

08:28.072 --> 08:29.875
Thanks, Padre.

08:34.645 --> 08:37.580
Hey, whoa! No! Play it again!
Play it again.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.648
Louie, I have
a surprise for you.

08:39.650 --> 08:42.721
It's how we found out
you were still alive.

08:45.856 --> 08:48.624
<i>Japanese have released a
recording of an American prisoner</i>

08:48.626 --> 08:51.197
<i>they claim is Olympian
Louie Zamperini.</i>

08:53.264 --> 08:55.268
<i>Hello, Mother.</i>

08:56.301 --> 08:58.267
<i>And Father.</i>

08:58.269 --> 09:00.539
<i>Relatives and friends.</i>

09:01.639 --> 09:03.739
<i>This is your Louie talking.</i>

09:03.741 --> 09:05.941
<i>Through the courtesy
of the authorities here,</i>

09:05.943 --> 09:08.645
<i>I'm broadcasting this
personal message to you.</i>

09:08.647 --> 09:10.347
Turn it off.

09:10.349 --> 09:13.116
<i>And this will be the first time
in two-and-a-half years</i>

09:13.118 --> 09:14.883
<i>that you will have
heard my voice.</i>

09:14.885 --> 09:16.719
Turn it off.

09:16.721 --> 09:18.787
<i>I am sure it's...</i>

09:40.645 --> 09:43.647
Dad kept the oil changed
for ya.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.650
He drove it around the
block once a week.

09:47.885 --> 09:49.886
Yeah.

09:49.888 --> 09:53.156
Well, I didn't think I'd ever
see this old wreck again.

09:53.158 --> 09:55.992
Hmm.

09:55.994 --> 09:59.028
- It's a work in progress. You'll get it tuned up.
- Ah, Pete.

09:59.030 --> 10:02.931
Now you are always seein' the
potential in things, you know,

10:02.933 --> 10:05.203
even your baby brother.

10:06.203 --> 10:08.204
I just made you lay off
those candy bars.

10:08.206 --> 10:10.272
No. Mm-mmm.

10:10.274 --> 10:13.245
No, sir, you turned me
into a running machine.

10:15.447 --> 10:17.680
But I will tell you
this much.

10:17.682 --> 10:22.252
See, when those... those B-29s,
they came flying over the camp,

10:22.254 --> 10:25.021
they dropped Hershey bars,
you know,

10:25.023 --> 10:26.826
and I couldn't
help myself.

10:27.926 --> 10:29.758
You ever see what chocolate
does to your guts

10:29.760 --> 10:31.997
after a couple of years
of moldy rice?

10:33.465 --> 10:37.403
It ain't pretty.

10:42.039 --> 10:43.708
Hmm.

10:46.912 --> 10:50.714
You know that Sunday
Pearl Harbor happened?

10:50.716 --> 10:52.315
- Yeah.
- I was eatin' waffles.

10:54.385 --> 10:56.953
I was on my way
to the golf course.

10:56.955 --> 10:59.488
They said that we were
at war, you know,

10:59.490 --> 11:02.858
but it didn't feel
like war, you know?

11:02.860 --> 11:04.728
Not to me.

11:04.730 --> 11:07.262
It wasn't until I was
stationed in San Diego.

11:07.264 --> 11:10.266
One day this hospital ship
comes steamin' in.

11:10.268 --> 11:13.002
They were carryin'
these... all these guys

11:13.004 --> 11:14.738
missin' legs and arms.

11:14.740 --> 11:20.042
They were... They were
all torn up, blind, burnt.

11:20.044 --> 11:22.311
You know, that's when
the war became real to me.

11:22.313 --> 11:25.114
And now they say
that it's over.

11:25.116 --> 11:27.416
But any second,

11:27.418 --> 11:29.422
I just keep feeling
like this...

11:31.155 --> 11:32.955
klaxon horn's gonna go off

11:32.957 --> 11:35.860
and it's
"Man your battle stations."

11:38.429 --> 11:41.066
Maybe the war's not over
just 'cause they say it is.

11:48.038 --> 11:51.273
Hey, come on.
Let's, uh... Let's head in.

11:51.275 --> 11:52.911
It's late.

11:54.011 --> 11:55.914
Yeah, I'll be in soon.

12:03.154 --> 12:07.089
Ah, you can't help
but be a big brother, can ya?

12:07.091 --> 12:08.994
It's a life sentence.

13:09.553 --> 13:11.421
Don't look at me!

13:16.126 --> 13:19.564
Rise and shine, knucklehead. Breakfast is ready.

13:28.038 --> 13:31.473
Hey, Louie.
Good to have you home.

13:31.475 --> 13:34.879
- Louie!
- Hey, welcome back, Louie. Lookin' good.

13:36.914 --> 13:40.182
- Louie! Hey!
- Hey, Louie!

13:40.184 --> 13:42.453
Yeah, Mr. Louie.

13:45.256 --> 13:46.390
Oh, hi.

13:46.392 --> 13:49.425
<i>Hey, who wants a shot
on me honoring the return</i>

13:49.427 --> 13:54.497
of Torrance's favorite son,
Louie Zamperini?

13:54.499 --> 13:56.999
- To Louie.
- To you!

13:57.001 --> 13:58.901
Hey, no, thanks, Reggie.
He's good.

13:58.903 --> 14:00.236
Come on, what are...
What are you, my shadow?

14:00.238 --> 14:02.571
You got some brass waitin'
for you back at the house.

14:02.573 --> 14:04.373
- Come on. I'll drive.
- What do they want?

14:04.375 --> 14:06.074
They're lookin'
for their hero.

14:06.076 --> 14:08.344
Yeah? Sorry, guys.
Duty calls, huh?

14:08.346 --> 14:10.512
- To Louie!
- Thank you, boys.

14:10.514 --> 14:12.515
Gotta go see the brass.

14:12.517 --> 14:17.119
Sales of war bonds have
taken a big dip since V-J Day.

14:17.121 --> 14:20.055
We need your help
to juice things up.

14:20.057 --> 14:23.325
All you have to do is shake
hands, make a little speech.

14:23.327 --> 14:27.063
- Something upbeat.
- Well, I've always done most of my talking with my feet.

14:27.065 --> 14:30.465
That's a
snappy way to put it.

14:30.467 --> 14:33.102
Yeah, I might be able
to use that.

14:33.104 --> 14:37.205
Uh, I'd like to get a few shots
with Captain Zamperini's family.

14:37.207 --> 14:40.175
Ladies and
gentlemen, Louie Zamperini!

14:42.980 --> 14:47.449
<i>I was proud to represent my
country in Berlin in the 1936 Olympics,</i>

14:47.451 --> 14:52.021
and, well, I sure am proud to represent
my country here today in Philadelphia.

14:52.023 --> 14:54.324
Now, when the brass
asked me to do this,

14:54.326 --> 14:58.127
I... I told them that I've always
done most of my talking with my feet.

15:00.097 --> 15:02.665
<i>Hello, Saint Louis.</i>

15:02.667 --> 15:04.700
Those bills,
well, they keep on comin' in,

15:04.702 --> 15:07.136
so I'm gonna need you
to keep buying war bonds.

15:07.138 --> 15:10.706
<i>Thank you so much for havin' me!</i>

15:10.708 --> 15:13.175
<i>Everyone always asks me
the same question.</i>

15:13.177 --> 15:17.446
They wanna know how do you survive 47
days on a raft in the Pacific Ocean.

15:17.448 --> 15:19.748
You talk about food.

15:19.750 --> 15:25.688
Now, I would describe to the boys how
my ma would cook my favorite dishes.

15:25.690 --> 15:28.127
Well, I'd get 'em droolin'.

15:29.094 --> 15:32.127
Mmm. Mmm.
Sorry about that.

15:32.129 --> 15:34.566
Uh, um...

15:37.067 --> 15:40.203
Uh, we talked...
We talked about girls.

15:40.205 --> 15:43.272
Uh, Rita Hayworth.

15:43.274 --> 15:46.242
Hey, how many... how many
polka dots on that swimsuit?

15:46.244 --> 15:49.212
I counted every single
polka dot on that pinup.

15:49.214 --> 15:51.079
It's 89.

15:51.081 --> 15:53.382
Eighty-nine polka dots.
I counted every single...

15:53.384 --> 15:57.322
You know, sometimes I wish I was one
of those polka dots.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.326
He's drunk.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.800
Uh, the war might be over,
but, uh...

16:11.802 --> 16:15.470
but the bills are still comin' in, so
just keep buyin' those bonds, folks.

16:15.472 --> 16:17.575
Thanks. All right.

16:35.493 --> 16:39.064
"Sometimes I wish
I was a polka dot."

16:41.599 --> 16:43.268
Yeah.

16:44.735 --> 16:47.335
Sorry about that.

16:47.337 --> 16:52.307
You need a snort before a speech to calm
you down? I got no trouble with that.

16:52.309 --> 16:57.079
But you been getting soused in the
club car on the train every night.

16:57.081 --> 16:59.283
What's goin' on with you?

17:00.518 --> 17:02.584
It's nothing.

17:02.586 --> 17:05.758
It's just hard to get a good night's
sleep on the road, that's all.

17:07.357 --> 17:11.259
When you get home, I want you to
go see my friend, Dr. Bailey.

17:11.261 --> 17:14.497
Right now, I'm giving you
three weeks R and R in Florida.

17:14.499 --> 17:16.101
Miami Beach.

17:17.501 --> 17:19.201
Three weeks? Starting when?

17:19.203 --> 17:22.771
Soon as you can get a taxi
to the station.

17:22.772 --> 17:26.444
Get yourself a suntan
and lay off the hooch.

17:28.313 --> 17:30.115
That's an order.

17:38.256 --> 17:39.691
Thank you.

17:55.807 --> 17:57.709
- Hey there, gorgeous.
- Hello.

18:13.625 --> 18:18.393
Well, I didn't know they served
"I-talians" in this joint.

18:18.395 --> 18:19.828
- Harry! Hey!
- Ha! Hey!

18:19.830 --> 18:22.498
Long time no see!

18:22.500 --> 18:26.268
It is so good to see you.
Mr. Tornado himself.

18:26.270 --> 18:28.504
- When'd you blow in?
- Just a couple hours ago.

18:28.506 --> 18:30.238
That is fantastic.
Fantastic.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.341
- What are you drinkin'?
- Uh, ginger ale.

18:32.343 --> 18:34.943
Ginger ale? What, are you trainin'
for the next Olympics or somethin'?

18:34.945 --> 18:39.248
Uh, barkeep!
Two Cuba Libres, <i>por favor.</i>

18:39.250 --> 18:41.918
- Well, you don't look worse for wear.
- Well, you know what?

18:41.920 --> 18:44.554
- I'm alive. That's all that matters.
- Damn right.

18:44.556 --> 18:46.756
Oh. Oh, wow.

18:46.758 --> 18:49.392
So many dames.
So little time.

18:49.394 --> 18:51.326
Well, they will keep you
on your toes.

18:51.328 --> 18:53.296
Yeah, I had one steppin'
on my toes last night.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.264
Took this hat-check girl
out for dinner.

18:55.266 --> 18:57.365
You know, steak, lobster,
the whole thing.

18:57.367 --> 18:59.834
Twenty-five bucks later, she
asks to use the ladies' room.

18:59.836 --> 19:02.337
I haven't seen her since.

19:02.339 --> 19:04.640
Ah, <i>gracias.</i>

19:04.642 --> 19:09.211
Drink up, pal. We got a lotta dolls
to meet and a lotta places to see.

19:09.213 --> 19:11.279
So, there I am at the
Hollywood Christmas Parade,

19:11.281 --> 19:12.882
standing outside
this store.

19:12.884 --> 19:15.617
This big old cowboy rides up
on this big old horse,

19:15.619 --> 19:17.886
and he says, "Hey, son,
you mind watchin' my horse?"

19:17.888 --> 19:19.455
I'm like, "Sure,
I'll watch your horse."

19:19.457 --> 19:22.658
I look at the saddle...
red rhinestones, "Trigger."

19:22.660 --> 19:27.697
It was Roy Rogers! I was
watchin' Roy Rogers' horse.

19:27.699 --> 19:31.299
Hey, did I tell you about the time I split
an ice cream cone with Lana Turner?

19:31.301 --> 19:34.569
Right down the middle. Hey, I need
a little help over here, pal.

19:34.571 --> 19:36.671
Doin' all the work
by myself.

19:36.673 --> 19:39.845
What are you lookin' at?
Oh, wow.

19:40.644 --> 19:42.644
Be still, my heart.

19:42.646 --> 19:44.947
Good eye, Lou.

19:44.949 --> 19:46.552
We're just gon...
Oh, all right.

19:49.019 --> 19:52.921
Good afternoon, ladies.

19:52.923 --> 19:56.992
You wouldn't happen to be lookin' for two
he-men to round out your party, would you?

19:56.994 --> 19:59.394
Sure. Do you know
where we can find any?

19:59.396 --> 20:02.530
Oh! Oh, you really know
how to shoot a guy down.

20:02.532 --> 20:03.431
Oh!

20:03.433 --> 20:07.505
She got me, Lou.
Tell my mother I love her.

20:08.806 --> 20:10.672
I think your friend
needs medical attention.

20:10.674 --> 20:12.874
Yeah,
I'm not a psychiatrist.

20:12.876 --> 20:14.278
Thanks a lot, pal.

20:16.446 --> 20:17.479
How ya doin'?

20:17.481 --> 20:18.847
You're Louis Zamperini,
aren't you?

20:18.849 --> 20:21.552
- Hello.
- Hello.

20:23.020 --> 20:26.322
I read about you in the papers,
saw you in the newsreels.

20:26.324 --> 20:28.490
Well, it's nice to meet you.

20:28.492 --> 20:30.492
Cynthia Applewhite.

20:32.029 --> 20:33.962
- "Do you know how to change a tire?"
- Oh.

20:33.964 --> 20:35.698
I turn around.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.700
It's Lana Turner sittin' on the
curb, eating an ice cream cone.

20:38.702 --> 20:40.969
And I tell her, "Hey, I don't
know how to change a tire."

20:40.971 --> 20:43.508
- Your friend is very entertaining.
- He sure thinks so.

20:45.309 --> 20:47.575
When I was a kid,
I lived near Torrance.

20:47.577 --> 20:49.444
You're kidding me.

20:49.446 --> 20:51.580
You still have the scars from
where those runners spiked you?

20:51.582 --> 20:53.619
- Yeah, they got me pretty good.
- Mmm. And that?

20:55.053 --> 20:57.385
Uh, Jap did that one.

20:57.387 --> 20:58.921
Thank you.

20:58.923 --> 21:00.456
For what?

21:00.458 --> 21:03.862
For preserving the free world
for silly girls like me.

21:05.363 --> 21:07.399
I think it was worth it.

21:11.602 --> 21:13.005
Um...

21:15.006 --> 21:17.006
- Hey, would you like to...
- Yes.

21:17.008 --> 21:19.975
What took you so long to ask?

21:19.977 --> 21:21.811
- You couldn't tell?
- I don't know.

21:21.813 --> 21:24.016
- I guess I'm a little rusty.
- Mmm.

21:31.756 --> 21:34.356
Do you always take girls
fishing on the first date?

21:34.358 --> 21:36.892
What, your mother
wouldn't approve?

21:36.894 --> 21:40.095
My mother only likes
fellows I don't.

21:40.097 --> 21:42.998
She wants me to marry someone
rich and predictable.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.933
You mean like that guy
in the Caddy convertible?

21:44.935 --> 21:47.505
How do you know that?

21:49.039 --> 21:51.140
I saw you
leaving with him.

21:51.142 --> 21:52.943
Huh.

21:54.010 --> 21:55.579
Quite the fisherman,
aren't you?

21:56.814 --> 21:59.081
- -Whoa! I
think I got a submarine.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.815
Hey, hold on. Here we go.

22:00.817 --> 22:03.052
- Just keep your rod tip up.
- Okay.

22:03.054 --> 22:04.719
Let your line play out.
It's all right.

22:05.990 --> 22:07.655
And hold on tight.

22:07.657 --> 22:10.394
You hold on tight,
or I'm gonna end up in Havana.

22:11.528 --> 22:14.462
- That was so much fun.
- Yeah.

22:14.464 --> 22:16.664
Not bad
for your first time.

22:16.666 --> 22:18.834
My arms feel like lead.

22:18.836 --> 22:20.603
What do you think it was?

22:20.605 --> 22:23.104
That is hard to tell.

22:23.106 --> 22:25.975
- Maybe a redfish.
- Mmm.

22:25.977 --> 22:28.811
Why do the good ones
always seem to get away?

22:28.813 --> 22:33.518
You know, I've been asking myself
that question a very long time.

23:11.689 --> 23:14.989
<i>A monster created
by a man they called mad.</i>

23:14.991 --> 23:18.059
Listen, I just thought that you'd be
too highbrow for <i>House of Dracula.</i>

23:18.061 --> 23:20.462
I love monster films.
I watch them all the time.

23:20.464 --> 23:24.600
Oh. Hey, you know what I love about comin'
to the picture show during the day?

23:24.602 --> 23:27.635
- What?
- Makes me feel like I'm playin' hooky from school.

23:27.637 --> 23:31.739
Just a juvenile
delinquent at heart.

23:31.741 --> 23:33.412
You got that right.

23:34.578 --> 23:36.745
<i>Halfway around
the world in Tokyo,</i>

23:36.747 --> 23:38.613
<i>another group was tried.</i>

23:38.615 --> 23:41.883
<i>Japan's Pearl Harbor
Premier Hideki Tojo</i>

23:41.885 --> 23:46.221
<i>led a list of 25 defendants accused
of war crimes and atrocities.</i>

23:46.223 --> 23:49.727
<i>After a two-year trial,
he was hanged for his acts.</i>

23:50.694 --> 23:53.194
<i>Brigadier General
Harvey Reynolds...</i>

23:53.196 --> 23:55.166
You thought you were free?

23:56.567 --> 24:01.440
I will never leave you.

24:02.906 --> 24:06.508
<i>...ceremony General
MacArthur expresses a wish.</i>

24:06.510 --> 24:09.245
<i>Let us pray that peace
be now restored to the world</i>

24:09.247 --> 24:11.650
<i>and that God
will preserve...</i>

24:17.054 --> 24:19.858
- Louie. Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

24:21.057 --> 24:22.661
I'm all right.

24:23.827 --> 24:26.631
I imagine it's hard
to watch some of that.

24:29.599 --> 24:31.769
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

24:38.675 --> 24:41.744
Did you pray while you
were off fighting the war?

24:41.746 --> 24:45.547
Oh, no. No.
Begging is more like it.

24:45.549 --> 24:48.816
Yeah, it's... I didn't pay
much attention in mass.

24:48.818 --> 24:51.155
I pray all the time.

24:53.924 --> 24:55.860
You're a prayer
answered for me.

24:57.728 --> 24:59.327
Well,

24:59.329 --> 25:02.698
you better not just be
something I'm dreaming.

25:02.700 --> 25:05.670
I'm gonna be very ticked off
if I wake up and you're gone.

25:08.873 --> 25:11.239
Ow!

25:11.241 --> 25:13.741
- What was that for?
- Waking you up.

25:13.743 --> 25:16.113
See, I'm still here.

25:16.980 --> 25:18.682
Yes, you are.

25:20.984 --> 25:23.187
Ah.

25:24.755 --> 25:26.858
Come on, Tarzan!

25:48.778 --> 25:50.281
Marry me.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.718
What?

25:55.019 --> 25:58.152
In a week, I gotta go back on
the road pitching war bonds,

25:58.154 --> 26:00.722
and... I'm not leaving here
without you.

26:00.724 --> 26:03.726
Yeah, that sounds more like a
kidnapping than a marriage proposal.

26:03.728 --> 26:06.929
You can go your whole life without ever meeting
the person you're supposed to be with,

26:06.931 --> 26:08.296
but you're the one!

26:08.298 --> 26:10.265
Look, we are meant
to be together.

26:10.267 --> 26:12.801
I'm not letting go.

26:16.906 --> 26:19.874
I'll race you for it.

26:19.876 --> 26:22.944
Beat me to the lifeguard
stand, and I'll marry you.

26:22.946 --> 26:26.015
You know I hold the national high
school record for the mile, right?

26:26.017 --> 26:30.322
Only looks like about 50 yards, and I've
been outrunning boys my whole life.

26:32.323 --> 26:34.222
And if I lose?

26:34.224 --> 26:36.158
Then you lose.

26:41.298 --> 26:42.933
You ready?

26:45.236 --> 26:48.069
Come on!

26:48.071 --> 26:50.139
- Right here?
- Yeah.

26:50.141 --> 26:52.807
On your mark.

26:52.809 --> 26:55.009
Get set.

26:55.011 --> 26:56.013
Go!

27:11.362 --> 27:13.761
You win.

27:21.838 --> 27:23.971
Well, see,
I <i>was</i> the Tornado.

27:23.973 --> 27:26.107
- Now I'm just the Torrance Tortoise.
- You're a great runner.

27:26.109 --> 27:31.380
You just need to get back out on the track.

27:31.382 --> 27:33.782
It means
I'm past my prime.

27:33.784 --> 27:36.785
I guess I should start
taking Italian lessons.

27:47.030 --> 27:50.099
That's our church.

27:50.101 --> 27:51.900
How did you know?

27:51.902 --> 27:54.405
You told me you went to
Sunday school here, remember?

28:18.095 --> 28:19.698
Thank you.

28:23.933 --> 28:27.135
This whole "For better
or for worse" thing

28:27.137 --> 28:28.937
and "In sickness
and in health..."

28:28.939 --> 28:31.405
You mean it?

28:31.407 --> 28:34.042
You sure
you wanna do this?

28:34.044 --> 28:35.480
Yeah.

28:40.183 --> 28:42.453
I'm here for you.

28:43.253 --> 28:45.988
Not the officer.

28:45.990 --> 28:48.222
Not the hero.

28:48.224 --> 28:49.894
You.

28:51.362 --> 28:53.798
I love you, Louie.

29:10.948 --> 29:13.817
- Congratulations!
- Take care, lovebirds!

29:14.451 --> 29:16.086
Whoo!

29:21.592 --> 29:23.424
Have fun!

29:23.426 --> 29:25.093
Beautiful.

30:02.066 --> 30:04.866
I wonder when they're gonna
fix that darn elevator.

30:04.868 --> 30:06.971
- The water won't turn off.
- What?

30:09.472 --> 30:11.405
Oh. Here.

30:11.407 --> 30:13.877
You just gotta hunker down on it.
Right.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.447
Oh! Whoa, whoa!

30:18.449 --> 30:20.414
Okay, come here.
Hold that. Hold that.

30:20.416 --> 30:22.986
Hold that. Oh. Here we go.
Where is it?

30:24.020 --> 30:26.191
Here it is.
I got it. I got it.

30:30.027 --> 30:31.492
What's so funny?

30:31.494 --> 30:33.497
Look at you.

30:36.901 --> 30:39.668
Look at you.

30:39.670 --> 30:41.937
- Come here. Come here.
- I know how to use this.

30:41.939 --> 30:43.971
Did I tell you...
Ah, come here!

30:43.973 --> 30:47.109
You're not gettin' away.
Yeah, all right.

30:47.111 --> 30:48.580
Mmm.

31:02.459 --> 31:05.864
You want to kill me?

31:17.441 --> 31:19.644
No! No, no!

31:27.684 --> 31:30.554
She cannot save you.

31:32.021 --> 31:34.989
I <i>will</i> destroy you both.

31:45.134 --> 31:47.736
<i>Mr. Zamperini, Major
Zeigler asked that we meet</i>

31:47.738 --> 31:52.574
because many of our combat veterans are
suffering from exhaustion and psychoneurosis.

31:52.576 --> 31:55.677
That doesn't sound like something
a shot of penicillin will fix.

31:55.679 --> 31:58.180
No, I'm afraid not.

31:58.182 --> 32:02.249
These men are waking up
screaming, sobbing,

32:02.251 --> 32:03.654
lashing out.

32:06.123 --> 32:08.293
Are you sleeping well?
Are you having any...

32:10.027 --> 32:11.996
night sweats or nightmares?

32:14.330 --> 32:16.300
Nothing I can't handle.

32:20.003 --> 32:24.341
Look, Doc, unless you
can help me find a job, I...

32:25.675 --> 32:28.145
I just don't think
there's much you can do for me.

32:30.646 --> 32:33.180
What is said in here
is just between you and me.

32:33.182 --> 32:38.088
Your mental health is just as important
as your physical well-being.

32:57.074 --> 33:00.611
Excuse me. Hi. I'm here to
apply for the delivery job.

33:01.444 --> 33:03.013
Thanks.

33:38.648 --> 33:43.418
<i>America's best runners competed

33:43.420 --> 33:46.488
<i>with their eyes set

33:46.490 --> 33:48.192
<i>for the '48 games

Oh, my... Oh, no.

Oh, my goodness.

34:21.692 --> 34:23.791
Oh.

34:23.793 --> 34:25.726
I wish they'd
fix that elevator.

34:25.728 --> 34:28.429
I don't trust it
even when it does work.

34:28.431 --> 34:30.797
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.800
I'm Cynthia Zamperini.

34:32.802 --> 34:36.271
Lila Johnson.
I-I saw you movin' in.

34:36.273 --> 34:39.739
Uh, your husband
is a pretty famous man.

34:39.742 --> 34:41.876
Lucky for us the landlord
recognized Lou.

34:41.878 --> 34:45.817
Everywhere we went, there were nearly
a hundred people on the waiting list.

34:48.152 --> 34:50.251
I'm at the end of the hall
if you need anything.

34:50.253 --> 34:51.518
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

34:51.521 --> 34:54.692
And just drop that basket
off anytime, honey.

34:57.293 --> 35:00.461
It looks like you've been
running barefoot on hot coals.

35:00.463 --> 35:02.396
I have to get used to it.

35:02.398 --> 35:05.833
You know, I can't get to
London with pretty feet.

35:05.835 --> 35:08.170
Are you serious?

35:08.172 --> 35:10.572
I got some old scores
to settle.

35:32.762 --> 35:35.197
What's this?

35:35.199 --> 35:37.666
If you're gonna train for London,
you have to do it right.

35:37.668 --> 35:39.537
We'll start at 6:30
every morning.

35:46.409 --> 35:47.876
Yes, dear.

35:47.878 --> 35:49.778
"Yes, dear."

35:49.780 --> 35:51.445
That's what husbands
are supposed to say

35:51.447 --> 35:53.615
when their wives
tell them to do something.

35:53.617 --> 35:55.920
- "Yes, dear."
- Yes, dear.

36:01.625 --> 36:03.458
I thought you said 6:30.

36:05.963 --> 36:08.362
Pete says to just run a
steady pace and not sprint,

36:08.364 --> 36:10.798
not until your body
gets used to running again.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.501
- Oh, you talked to Pete about this?
- Of course.

36:13.503 --> 36:15.637
I didn't know where
to buy track shoes.

36:15.639 --> 36:19.376
So, just go nice and easy and see if
you can make it all the way around.

36:20.643 --> 36:23.246
On your mark, get set, go!

36:24.748 --> 36:26.349
I said go.

36:27.650 --> 36:29.252
Yes, dear.

36:38.594 --> 36:40.327
Much better!

36:40.329 --> 36:43.266
But don't stop.
Do another lap.

36:47.403 --> 36:48.802
Thank you, Lord.

36:48.804 --> 36:51.405
4:09!

36:51.407 --> 36:53.340
Look out, London!

36:58.315 --> 37:01.548
You know, as I-I cross the finish
line, you're mumbling something.

37:01.550 --> 37:04.686
I wasn't mumbling.
I was saying a prayer.

37:04.688 --> 37:07.488
- Yeah? Why?
- Sure seems to make a difference.

37:07.490 --> 37:10.827
You're shaving half a second
off your time every day.

37:12.596 --> 37:15.362
- Just 'cause I'm getting into better shape.
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.

37:15.364 --> 37:18.499
Come on, I'll jog
a warm-down lap with you.

37:18.501 --> 37:19.603
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.

37:20.871 --> 37:22.670
Come here.

37:22.672 --> 37:24.972
Hey!

37:24.974 --> 37:28.645
I'm so fast!

37:35.985 --> 37:38.452
Mmm.
Smelling good, Papa.

37:40.456 --> 37:43.624
Sylvia, go check on the pie.

37:43.626 --> 37:47.461
- Boys! Boys, stop.
- Oh! Yes, Mama.

37:47.463 --> 37:49.697
- Don't hurt your brother.
- Yes, of course not, Mama.

37:49.699 --> 37:51.335
Be nice.

37:56.639 --> 37:58.340
So, how's
the running going?

37:58.342 --> 38:00.008
- She's got me out there every morning.
- Yeah?

38:00.010 --> 38:02.876
I thought you were bad.
She's a taskmaster.

38:02.878 --> 38:04.614
You think you can run
a 4:07 mile again?

38:05.815 --> 38:08.483
I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't.

38:08.485 --> 38:10.651
Yeah, I'm just saying
you're not a kid anymore.

38:10.653 --> 38:14.025
You still think you can
compete at the Olympic level?

38:22.766 --> 38:24.668
Does Lou know?

38:33.043 --> 38:36.378
He's so worried
about money, finding work.

38:36.380 --> 38:38.847
I don't wanna say anything
until I have to.

38:38.849 --> 38:43.487
Hey, come on. Lou bet Pete
he could run a 4:07 mile.

38:46.523 --> 38:47.958
Hike!

38:51.061 --> 38:54.396
Yeah. That's fast.

38:54.398 --> 38:56.600
- Aw, man.
- That's Louie Zamperini!

38:57.666 --> 38:59.603
Hey, guys!

39:01.771 --> 39:04.072
Hiya, Louie!

39:04.074 --> 39:06.641
- Hey, fellas.
- What are you doin' here?

39:06.643 --> 39:08.809
I just thought I'd put
some miles on this track.

39:08.811 --> 39:12.746
- You goin' for a run?
- You can't do a 4:07 mile if you don't run.

39:12.748 --> 39:14.983
Well, can we
run with you?

39:14.985 --> 39:17.485
Suppose if you like
lookin' at my backside.

39:17.487 --> 39:19.887
I don't know. I was the league
champ in the mile last year.

39:19.889 --> 39:23.124
Well, maybe I'll see you
at the '48 Olympics in London.

39:23.126 --> 39:25.096
I'm not racing
Louis Zamperini.

39:33.103 --> 39:36.106
All right, boys!
On your marks, get set!

39:38.974 --> 39:40.675
Go!

40:33.697 --> 40:36.599
4:07!

40:38.134 --> 40:40.168
Louis!

40:40.170 --> 40:43.641
Louie!

41:01.157 --> 41:03.724
We'll have another doctor
take a look.

41:03.726 --> 41:05.829
There must be something
that they can do.

41:08.864 --> 41:12.669
Army doc in Tokyo told me if I
hurt it again, it was all over.

41:13.536 --> 41:15.605
Why didn't you
tell me that?

41:17.039 --> 41:19.108
'Cause it doesn't matter.

41:21.744 --> 41:24.614
Louie, we're supposed
to be open with each other.

41:27.650 --> 41:31.119
You know, when I was a kid,
I fell down some stairs.

41:31.121 --> 41:33.655
I was maybe six
or seven years old,

41:33.657 --> 41:35.956
and I fell
and I-I hurt myself.

41:35.958 --> 41:38.226
So I cursed.

41:38.228 --> 41:41.764
I'd get up, and son of a gun
if I didn't fall...

41:44.000 --> 41:45.235
again.

41:48.672 --> 41:51.039
See, that's three times
that I fell,

41:51.041 --> 41:53.007
and I remember
thinking to myself...

41:53.009 --> 41:55.913
I thought so clearly
that it was God.

41:58.614 --> 42:00.847
That he was doing this to me.

42:00.849 --> 42:03.684
He was tripping me up. And I just
can't help but think that maybe,

42:03.686 --> 42:05.853
just maybe
he's doing it again.

42:05.855 --> 42:07.257
- Louie...
- No. No.

42:08.224 --> 42:10.693
I was doing
what I was born to do.

42:11.795 --> 42:13.760
I was back on the track.

42:13.762 --> 42:18.231
It's just everything
is... whole again.

42:18.233 --> 42:21.137
It's...
I'm just whole again.

42:23.106 --> 42:26.307
You know, all the things, the
terrible things, they just go away.

42:26.309 --> 42:31.144
It's just my heart pumping,
and my... my lungs pumping,

42:31.146 --> 42:33.717
and my legs pumping.

42:38.922 --> 42:40.757
And it's necessary.

42:43.293 --> 42:45.162
I mean, do you see that?

42:46.896 --> 42:48.298
Mm-hmm.

42:49.965 --> 42:51.969
Tryin' to take it away,
it's...

43:02.012 --> 43:03.981
We pushed too hard.

43:06.048 --> 43:07.851
Was that it?

43:12.054 --> 43:13.957
Is this some kind
of punishment?

43:42.018 --> 43:45.219
<i>I was standin' there at the Hollywood Christmas parade,</i>

43:45.221 --> 43:47.358
<i>and a cowboy comes up to me
on a big horse.</i>

43:48.791 --> 43:51.291
And I kid you not,
it was Roy Rogers.

43:51.293 --> 43:53.427
Oh, there he is.

43:53.429 --> 43:57.130
Ladies and gentlemen,
the late Louie Zamperini!

43:57.132 --> 44:00.637
Sorry we're late.
Phil, come here.

44:02.838 --> 44:06.074
- It's great to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

44:06.076 --> 44:07.742
This is my wife, Cecile.

44:07.744 --> 44:09.476
Call me Cecy.
Everyone does.

44:09.478 --> 44:11.278
I've heard so much
about you.

44:11.280 --> 44:14.115
- It's lovely to finally meet you.
- You too.

44:14.117 --> 44:16.117
This is my wife,
Cynthia.

44:16.119 --> 44:17.719
- Hello.
- Hi.

44:17.721 --> 44:19.253
Oh!

44:19.255 --> 44:22.724
Yeah, this is Valerie. She
works for Universal Pictures.

44:22.726 --> 44:26.396
- I'm just in the typing pool.
- Hello.

44:30.300 --> 44:33.266
- So, what's with the limp?
- Oh, it's nothing.

44:33.268 --> 44:37.271
I just, uh, tripped
going down some stairs.

44:37.273 --> 44:42.142
Oh, hey, Phil was tellin' us about that
crash landing you guys had in that B-24.

44:42.144 --> 44:43.778
Sounds like
a whale of a tale.

44:43.780 --> 44:45.179
The only reason
I'm still alive

44:45.181 --> 44:48.148
is because this guy was
the best pilot in the Pacific.

44:48.150 --> 44:49.952
- Here's to Harold.
- Yeah.

44:51.253 --> 44:53.320
- Who's Harold?
- Uh, Harold Brooks.

44:53.322 --> 44:54.789
He was one
of our waist gunners.

44:54.791 --> 44:58.327
He didn't make it back
alive that day.

45:04.367 --> 45:07.705
Pardon me.
I need to powder my nose.

45:09.304 --> 45:12.907
Would you mind goin' with Val
just to make sure she comes back?

45:12.909 --> 45:14.208
- What?
- What?

45:14.210 --> 45:17.081
I'll join you too.

45:24.052 --> 45:25.219
Hey.

45:25.221 --> 45:28.088
- Uh, give me another round and keep 'em coming.
- Yes, sir.

45:28.090 --> 45:31.358
Whoa, slow down, Jack. I gotta get
a little food in my belly first.

45:31.360 --> 45:33.059
Well, you could have
a breadstick.

45:33.061 --> 45:35.429
Hey, how's it bein'
back home in Indiana?

45:35.431 --> 45:37.932
Beats Japan.

45:37.934 --> 45:40.967
I read in the paper
they can't find The Bird.

45:40.969 --> 45:44.338
Rounded up all the rest of the
guards, but he flew the coop.

45:44.340 --> 45:46.343
Who?

45:47.943 --> 45:52.546
Jap prison guard.
Matsuhiro Watanabe.

45:52.548 --> 45:55.249
Called him The Bird.

45:55.251 --> 45:57.517
He was the worst
of the worst.

45:57.519 --> 45:59.123
Real nightmare.

46:00.422 --> 46:02.590
Hey, I just
read about this ex-POW,

46:02.592 --> 46:04.858
he was headin' to work,
you know, still over there.

46:04.860 --> 46:06.961
And he saw this Jap face
in the crowd.

46:06.963 --> 46:10.097
Well, he gets suspicious,
so he follows him,

46:10.099 --> 46:12.499
and dang if it ain't
a guard from his camp.

46:12.501 --> 46:15.836
- What'd he do?
- Blew the whistle on him.

46:15.838 --> 46:18.541
Now he's coolin' his heels
in Sugamo Prison.

46:20.476 --> 46:22.512
Prison is too good
for The Bird.

46:27.050 --> 46:28.849
Okay, okay.

46:28.851 --> 46:32.253
Okay, so I look up,
and these two lovebirds... gone.

46:32.255 --> 46:34.155
Vanished, poof,
right into thin air.

46:34.157 --> 46:36.356
So, about a week goes by,
I see Mr. Tornado.

46:36.358 --> 46:38.860
I say, "Hey, bud.
Where'd you guys go?"

46:38.862 --> 46:41.162
He looks at me,
and you know what he says?

46:41.164 --> 46:43.063
"Fishing."
Yeah, fishing.

46:43.065 --> 46:45.066
Can you believe that?
So romantic.

46:47.436 --> 46:50.204
It's the truth, Harry.
We really did go fishing.

46:50.206 --> 46:52.273
Yeah, well, I'm never
gonna believe that one.

46:57.146 --> 47:01.885
- -Hey, waiter.
What... What is this?

47:02.885 --> 47:05.186
- Sir?
- What is this?

47:05.188 --> 47:08.456
- It's rice, sir.
- I didn't order rice.

47:08.458 --> 47:11.161
- It comes with the meal, sir.
- Yeah, but nobody ordered rice.

47:14.097 --> 47:16.162
- Listen.
- Louie.

47:16.164 --> 47:18.199
- I've had my fill of rice.
- Louie, come on.

47:18.201 --> 47:21.034
Rice with dirt in it,
and bugs and maggots.

47:21.036 --> 47:22.403
- What the heck is your problem?
- It's all right, Lou.

47:22.405 --> 47:25.305
- It's not all right. What the heck is your problem?
- He didn't know.

47:25.307 --> 47:28.579
- It was a mistake, pal.
- Hey, don't bring stuff that people didn't order!

47:47.697 --> 47:49.932
The Bird can't
get away with this.

47:50.599 --> 47:53.467
Somebody's gotta
catch The Bird.

47:53.469 --> 47:56.273
Can't...
get away with it.

47:57.373 --> 48:00.141
Gotta find him.

48:00.143 --> 48:02.079
Find The Bird.

48:06.615 --> 48:08.885
Come on.
Get up.

48:10.353 --> 48:11.655
Gonna find him.

48:19.027 --> 48:20.496
Oh, Louie.

50:12.809 --> 50:14.474
Aah!

50:14.476 --> 50:15.411
Whoa!
Hold up!

50:27.489 --> 50:29.692
You will obey me!

50:30.559 --> 50:32.459
Please!

50:32.461 --> 50:33.726
Please!

50:33.728 --> 50:36.198
Please!
No!

50:57.219 --> 51:00.253
<i>Gather here
Sunday afternoon every evening</i>

51:00.255 --> 51:03.791
<i>to hear the word of God preached
in the power of his spirit</i>

51:03.793 --> 51:05.860
<i>by Dr. Billy Graham
to the salvation...</i>

51:05.862 --> 51:08.729
At least eat
some toast.

51:08.731 --> 51:10.400
I'm not hungry.

51:15.804 --> 51:20.206
I'm gonna call Pete.
He'll know what to do.

51:20.208 --> 51:21.809
Don't...
Don't call Pete.

51:21.811 --> 51:23.610
I can't do this
on my own.

51:23.612 --> 51:25.147
Lookit...

51:25.882 --> 51:28.251
last night was, uh...

51:30.385 --> 51:32.255
it was just the booze.

51:34.157 --> 51:36.259
I just need to get a job.

51:39.295 --> 51:41.394
No, don't... Come on.
Where are you going?

51:41.396 --> 51:42.829
To borrow Lila's phone.

51:42.831 --> 51:44.597
Look, I don't want you
to call my brother!

51:44.599 --> 51:47.168
- I don't want Pete knowing about it...
- About what?

51:47.170 --> 51:49.302
You had nothing to hide
last night at the restaurant.

51:49.304 --> 51:51.572
- You were acting crazy in front of everyone...
- I'm not crazy.

51:51.574 --> 51:53.374
I had too much to drink.

51:53.376 --> 51:54.441
Lou, let go...

51:54.443 --> 51:55.742
Let go of me!

51:55.744 --> 51:57.447
I'm pregnant.

52:02.217 --> 52:03.118
What?

52:04.452 --> 52:07.257
I'm gonna have a baby.
I'm two months pregnant.

52:08.724 --> 52:10.925
Why didn't you say anything?

52:10.927 --> 52:13.459
Because I'm scared.

52:13.461 --> 52:16.298
Ever since you hurt your ankle,
you're so angry.

52:19.402 --> 52:22.271
If you don't get help somehow, I
don't know what I'm going to do.

52:25.407 --> 52:27.608
I'm-I'm sorry.

52:27.610 --> 52:30.881
I need more than sorry, Lou.

52:42.358 --> 52:44.794
Your physical was fine.
Your lab work came back normal.

52:47.295 --> 52:51.331
In terms of helping with your inability
to sleep and your emotional instability,

52:51.333 --> 52:53.800
we've had some results
with hypnosis,

52:53.802 --> 52:56.906
electric shock treatment,
and narcosis therapy.

52:58.507 --> 52:59.673
Narcosis therapy?

52:59.675 --> 53:03.543
We use high doses of sodium
amytal and other barbiturates

53:03.545 --> 53:06.813
to help you sleep for 18 to 20
hours a day for several days.

53:06.815 --> 53:08.349
No, I...

53:08.351 --> 53:10.516
I'm sure that that works
gangbusters for some guys,

53:10.518 --> 53:12.885
but that just makes me want
a double scotch on the rocks.

53:12.887 --> 53:16.523
Everyone needs help
at some point, Lou.

53:16.525 --> 53:17.460
Even heroes.

53:19.327 --> 53:21.565
I'm just a guy who did
nothing more than survive.

53:23.666 --> 53:26.403
There's a lot of people that
would disagree with that.

53:28.403 --> 53:30.604
In the prison camps,

53:30.606 --> 53:34.941
they tried to take your humanity
and you wouldn't let them.

53:34.943 --> 53:37.978
And now it's our job
to help you get through this.

53:37.980 --> 53:39.815
I wish you could.

53:49.625 --> 53:51.358
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:51.360 --> 53:52.596
How'd it go?

53:54.329 --> 53:55.362
Good.

53:55.364 --> 53:58.831
Yeah, he said that
I'm not alone.

53:58.833 --> 54:00.800
Does he wanna
see you again?

54:00.802 --> 54:03.537
Yeah, same time next week.

54:03.539 --> 54:05.472
What's in the bag?

54:05.474 --> 54:07.340
Uh, nothin'.

54:07.342 --> 54:11.647
Just got some foot powder, toothpaste,
a little bit of mouthwash.

54:13.715 --> 54:15.418
Got you a Baby Ruth.

54:20.456 --> 54:21.891
Louie?

54:22.925 --> 54:25.394
Thank you.

55:16.045 --> 55:18.045
Whoo!

55:18.047 --> 55:20.382
So, what you hopin' for,
a boy or a girl?

55:21.583 --> 55:23.385
What gives?

55:29.592 --> 55:31.094
Lou?

55:35.398 --> 55:37.934
Just some trouble in paradise.

55:44.639 --> 55:47.807
I been havin' these dreams,
you know?

55:47.809 --> 55:48.909
War dreams?

55:48.911 --> 55:51.577
About Watanabe.

55:51.579 --> 55:53.447
A lot?

55:53.449 --> 55:54.717
Too much.

56:03.826 --> 56:06.128
I just thought I'd be able
to forget everything.

56:10.798 --> 56:13.467
You know, when we, uh, heard
that your plane went down,

56:13.469 --> 56:15.969
I told Mom, I said, "If Louie can
get his feet on solid ground,

56:15.971 --> 56:17.438
he's gonna be fine.

56:17.440 --> 56:19.773
We just give him a scout knife
and a toothbrush,

56:19.775 --> 56:21.644
he can take care
of himself."

56:24.947 --> 56:27.447
Come on.

56:27.449 --> 56:30.018
"A moment of pain is worth a
lifetime of glory," remember?

56:32.086 --> 56:33.686
Come on.
Once you get that kid,

56:33.688 --> 56:37.090
once you have that kid, that's gonna be the
only thing inside that brain of yours.

56:37.092 --> 56:39.159
Huh?
All right?

56:39.161 --> 56:41.028
- Is that so?
- Oh, yeah. Is that so?

56:41.030 --> 56:42.729
- Yeah?
- Oh, you think you've got moves, huh?

56:42.731 --> 56:44.865
I'm comin' for ya. You know, I
got something in this brain.

56:49.905 --> 56:51.905
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

56:51.907 --> 56:55.675
Okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

56:55.677 --> 56:57.480
That's okay.

56:58.947 --> 57:00.583
Ahh.

57:07.755 --> 57:09.591
It's Cynthia.

57:12.927 --> 57:14.596
It's to honor
the best part of me.

57:21.036 --> 57:24.037
Okay, yeah, all right.
All right.

57:24.039 --> 57:25.972
Shh, shh, shh.
That's right.

57:25.974 --> 57:27.974
Shh, shh, shh.

57:32.914 --> 57:34.514
- No, no, it's okay.
- Shh, shh, shh.

57:34.516 --> 57:36.182
I got it.
I got it.

57:40.789 --> 57:46.793
<i>♪ Like a diamond in the sky ♪</i>

57:46.795 --> 57:53.032
<i>♪ Twinkle, twinkle
Little star ♪</i>

57:53.034 --> 57:59.541
<i>♪ How I wonder what you are ♪</i>

58:06.849 --> 58:08.849
Oh, Louie.

58:08.851 --> 58:09.950
It's a real honor.

58:09.952 --> 58:12.552
You know, when Harry told me
you were looking for work,

58:12.554 --> 58:15.822
I said, "Lou Zamperini is
just the man we need."

58:15.824 --> 58:17.159
Come on in.

58:18.693 --> 58:20.230
Have a seat.

58:22.097 --> 58:25.699
I was in the stands
at SC in '38

58:25.701 --> 58:29.001
when you set the NCAA record
for the mile.

58:29.003 --> 58:32.039
- What was it, four minutes and eight seconds, right?
- Yeah. That's right.

58:32.041 --> 58:34.577
Pleased as punch
to have you in, Lou.

58:35.978 --> 58:37.713
Let's talk buttermilk.

58:38.813 --> 58:39.912
Sure.

58:39.914 --> 58:41.315
I'm retooling.

58:41.317 --> 58:44.217
I'm expanding, and powdered
milk is the future of Quinn's.

58:44.219 --> 58:48.621
But first, why does the Torrance Tornado
wanna be in the dairy business?

58:48.623 --> 58:51.157
I... You could work anywhere
with that USC degree.

58:51.159 --> 58:55.163
I wish that were the case, Howard,
but I never graduated USC.

58:56.798 --> 58:57.731
You didn't graduate?

58:57.733 --> 59:00.733
It was part of the price
of goin' off to war.

59:00.735 --> 59:03.170
I see.

59:03.172 --> 59:05.738
I was under the impression
that you had.

59:05.740 --> 59:09.108
See, everyone in corporate
has a college degree.

59:09.110 --> 59:11.744
I could... Well, um,

59:11.746 --> 59:13.282
how are you
makin' ends meet?

59:17.219 --> 59:21.188
Um, when the army thought
I was dead,

59:21.190 --> 59:23.192
they cut my mother a check
for ten grand.

59:24.326 --> 59:26.293
She wouldn't cash it.

59:26.295 --> 59:29.762
And when I came back alive,
they let me keep it.

59:29.764 --> 59:31.733
I guess that takes the sting
out of bein' dead.

59:33.135 --> 59:34.938
Yeah, I guess it does.

59:36.237 --> 59:40.641
Okay, well, you know,
thank you for your time.

59:40.643 --> 59:42.244
Yeah.

59:45.047 --> 59:46.112
Good luck, Lou.

59:46.114 --> 59:47.649
Thanks.

59:51.085 --> 59:53.086
I got a five-to-one.

59:53.088 --> 59:54.420
He moves ahead
in the home stretch.

59:54.422 --> 59:56.358
I got a hundred bucks
in my pocket.

59:59.027 --> 01:00:00.427
On me, Zamp.

01:00:00.429 --> 01:00:02.128
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
what happened?

01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:03.764
I got a filly
in the second race...

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.932
<i>The young
evangelist Billy Graham</i>

01:00:05.934 --> 01:00:09.802
<i>and song leader Cliff Barrows,
his wife Billie Barrows,</i>

01:00:09.804 --> 01:00:12.204
<i>and Beverly Shea,
the gospel singer,</i>

01:00:12.206 --> 01:00:18.144
<i>who cooperate with Christ for a Greater
Los Angeles in a great revival campaign.</i>

01:00:18.146 --> 01:00:20.813
Is he drinking again?

01:00:20.815 --> 01:00:23.115
He says he
isn't, but it's a lie.

01:00:23.117 --> 01:00:26.385
Just like saying he's out
looking for work every day.

01:00:26.387 --> 01:00:29.289
Have you told him
you know the truth?

01:00:29.291 --> 01:00:31.157
I don't think
it will make a difference.

01:00:31.159 --> 01:00:34.061
God often uses difficulties
in our lives

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:37.697
as a way of preparing us
for our greater purpose.

01:00:37.699 --> 01:00:41.101
I can't tell you what to do,
but I do know this.

01:00:41.103 --> 01:00:43.840
Lou is worth the fight.

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:50.242
Sometimes I don't think
I know him at all.

01:00:50.244 --> 01:00:52.878
Oh, sweetie,
it takes time.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.882
It's like two trees planted
side-by-side.

01:00:55.884 --> 01:00:58.784
Over the years they grow
in and around each other.

01:00:58.786 --> 01:01:03.023
That's why widows like me
look so odd sometimes.

01:01:03.025 --> 01:01:04.990
Sorry.
I shouldn't complain.

01:01:04.992 --> 01:01:06.996
Oh.
Oh, no, don't.

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:11.130
Don't be. He had his
own demons like Lou.

01:01:11.132 --> 01:01:13.001
But we faced them
down together.

01:01:24.012 --> 01:01:26.847
Honey, hi, hi. This is a friend of mine.
It's Fred Porter.

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:29.115
And this is, uh...
this is my wife, Cynthia.

01:01:29.117 --> 01:01:31.019
It's nice to meet ya.

01:01:39.327 --> 01:01:40.927
Cynthia?

01:01:40.929 --> 01:01:42.465
Hey, where ya been?

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.342
At church.

01:01:56.177 --> 01:01:57.811
<i>Hey, where's the checkbook?</i>

01:01:57.813 --> 01:02:00.349
It's in my purse.
Why?

01:02:06.922 --> 01:02:07.987
What was that?

01:02:07.989 --> 01:02:09.856
Oh, never mind.

01:02:09.858 --> 01:02:11.191
Just...

01:02:11.193 --> 01:02:13.827
Just give me the checkbook.

01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:14.897
God.

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:17.900
What are you doin'?

01:02:18.967 --> 01:02:21.003
That's what I was
going to ask you.

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.574
- Don't embarrass me like this.
- Why do you need the checkbook?

01:02:27.576 --> 01:02:29.342
Because I'm going into
business with Fred.

01:02:29.344 --> 01:02:30.809
What kind of business?

01:02:30.811 --> 01:02:34.947
We're gonna buy surplus trucks from the
army, sell 'em to the Philippines.

01:02:34.949 --> 01:02:38.150
The auction's tomorrow,
so I need to give him a check,

01:02:38.152 --> 01:02:41.454
which he's gonna take to the
bank first thing in the morning.

01:02:41.456 --> 01:02:43.356
How much?

01:02:43.358 --> 01:02:44.827
It's like 3,000.

01:02:46.961 --> 01:02:49.563
That's almost all the money that we
have left in your life insurance.

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:51.831
Yeah, you gotta spend money
in order to make money.

01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:53.300
We're gonna make plenty
of money off this deal.

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:55.836
But what do you know about selling
trucks in the Philippines?

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:57.838
What do want me to do?
You want me to pump gas?

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.072
What's wrong with that?

01:02:59.074 --> 01:03:02.075
Oh, yeah, I can see that now.
Hi, I'm the Torrance Tornado.

01:03:02.077 --> 01:03:05.045
Why don't you come down and I'll
fill her up? Maybe change the oil.

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:07.847
It's a fat chance.
Now just give me the checkbook!

01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:09.851
No.

01:03:11.253 --> 01:03:13.220
You don't get to
tell me no.

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:17.891
That is my money, and I am the one
who died for it, so give me it.

01:03:17.893 --> 01:03:20.260
You're drunk!
You're drunk!

01:03:22.396 --> 01:03:25.599
You know, enough with the Saint
Cynthia of Miami Beach routine.

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:29.539
Now, you did not marry me because you thought
that I would make a good gas pump jockey.

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:33.409
I married you because I thought
you were a good man!

01:03:43.518 --> 01:03:45.420
Fantastic.

01:03:46.655 --> 01:03:48.320
You got this?

01:03:48.322 --> 01:03:49.889
You're the champ.

01:03:49.891 --> 01:03:52.191
Yep, I'm doin'
all right.

01:04:19.621 --> 01:04:22.322
Hollowed-out Bible.

01:04:22.324 --> 01:04:24.456
That's where I'll hide it.

01:04:24.458 --> 01:04:26.862
Jap customs agent
won't mess with a Bible.

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:30.496
Mmm.

01:04:30.498 --> 01:04:33.066
Oh, she called you?

01:04:33.068 --> 01:04:35.334
Let's go.
You're comin' home with me.

01:04:35.336 --> 01:04:37.039
Oh, beat it, will ya?

01:04:38.373 --> 01:04:41.240
Well, you're not goin' back
to the apartment tonight.

01:04:41.242 --> 01:04:42.943
Sylvia's staying there.

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:45.514
Is that... Well, it's a real
family reunion then.

01:04:49.583 --> 01:04:51.418
What are you gonna do
with this? Huh?

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.720
- What are you gonna do with this?
- It's none of your business.

01:04:53.722 --> 01:04:56.722
None of my business? Is this
none of my business too? Huh?

01:04:56.724 --> 01:04:58.090
Round-trip airfare
to Tokyo? What?

01:04:58.092 --> 01:05:02.030
- Are you and your little .38 plannin' a trip to Japan?
- Maybe we are.

01:05:06.268 --> 01:05:07.700
You're a drunk.

01:05:07.702 --> 01:05:09.501
Is this where you met
your new business partner?

01:05:09.503 --> 01:05:12.204
You put up the G's and he puts up
what, another round of drinks?

01:05:12.206 --> 01:05:14.240
Stay out of it, all right?
I know what I'm doing.

01:05:14.242 --> 01:05:17.510
You haven't known what you're doing
since you walked out of that POW camp.

01:05:17.512 --> 01:05:21.380
You need help, but you're not
man enough to accept it.

01:05:21.382 --> 01:05:23.285
I'm not man enough?

01:05:25.086 --> 01:05:27.989
I'm more of a man than
you'll ever be, big brother.

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:33.559
You never got caught up in a
sinking plane and almost drowned.

01:05:33.561 --> 01:05:36.262
No, you never had them
hold you down,

01:05:36.264 --> 01:05:39.766
stick a needle in your arm and pump you
full of garbage until you almost died,

01:05:39.768 --> 01:05:43.536
and you certainly never had The Bird punch
you in the face over and over again

01:05:43.538 --> 01:05:45.007
until you almost...

01:05:46.407 --> 01:05:47.673
Now, see, you?

01:05:47.675 --> 01:05:49.141
You were on your nice,
clean ship

01:05:49.143 --> 01:05:51.244
with your nice,
clean sheets,

01:05:51.246 --> 01:05:54.046
eatin' your Wheaties.

01:05:54.048 --> 01:05:56.585
So, thank you
for your service, sailor.

01:06:05.626 --> 01:06:07.360
Don't go back to
the apartment tonight.

01:06:07.362 --> 01:06:09.295
Mm-hmm.

01:06:09.297 --> 01:06:12.034
Leave Cynthia alone.
She doesn't want you there.

01:06:15.302 --> 01:06:18.104
I don't know why they keep pushing
stuff like that. Look at that.

01:06:18.106 --> 01:06:19.171
It's just...

01:06:42.797 --> 01:06:44.733
Do you want to escape?

01:06:55.643 --> 01:06:58.146
I asked you a question!

01:07:00.849 --> 01:07:02.682
Do you want to escape?

01:07:02.684 --> 01:07:05.054
I wanna go home!

01:07:07.688 --> 01:07:10.091
There is no home.

01:07:20.501 --> 01:07:21.568
If you save me...

01:07:47.695 --> 01:07:49.595
There you go, buddy.

01:07:49.597 --> 01:07:51.132
On the house.

01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:28.701
Go to hell, Lou.

01:08:28.703 --> 01:08:30.469
I do every night!

01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:32.171
And what about me, huh?

01:08:32.173 --> 01:08:33.772
When you come home
reeking of whiskey!

01:08:33.774 --> 01:08:36.408
Or when you don't even
come home at all?

01:08:36.411 --> 01:08:39.178
I'm taking Cissy,
and I'm going to Florida.

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:40.946
What're you gonna do? You're
gonna go home to your parents?

01:08:40.948 --> 01:08:42.482
And tell them how stupid
you were to marry me?

01:08:42.484 --> 01:08:46.854
- I can't take care of her and a drunk at the same time.
- So, what're you saying?

01:08:50.725 --> 01:08:53.295
I'm saying I want a divorce.

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:05.337
It's 499
one way to Tokyo.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.471
It's only 850
round trip, so...

01:09:06.474 --> 01:09:08.508
<i>You thought you were free.</i>

01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:09.942
Round trip is the way to go.

01:09:09.944 --> 01:09:12.611
<i>Don't look at me.</i>

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.456
Look at me.

01:09:25.894 --> 01:09:28.796
You are nothing.

01:09:44.645 --> 01:09:46.712
<i>You thought you were free.</i>

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:48.747
<i>You are nothing.</i>

01:09:50.452 --> 01:09:52.587
<i>You are nothing.</i>

01:09:53.921 --> 01:09:56.789
<i>You... Don't... are nothing...
look at me...</i>

01:09:59.327 --> 01:10:02.527
Lou?

01:10:02.529 --> 01:10:03.896
- <i>You...</i>
- Lou.

01:10:03.898 --> 01:10:06.499
<i>are nothing.</i>

01:10:06.501 --> 01:10:07.869
Did I get your attention?

01:10:13.041 --> 01:10:15.476
I'm, uh... I'm going out.

01:10:17.746 --> 01:10:19.847
Lila asked me
to go to the revival, so...

01:10:24.685 --> 01:10:27.053
Well, hide your wallet.

01:10:27.055 --> 01:10:28.856
The circus is in town.

01:11:04.859 --> 01:11:08.061
You could come too. He's
supposed to be different.

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:10.532
Not like the old
revival shows.

01:11:11.966 --> 01:11:13.598
Maybe he could help you.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.401
Look at me.
Look at me.

01:11:15.403 --> 01:11:18.440
This is why I should bow down to
God, to thank him for what I am?

01:11:20.108 --> 01:11:22.808
I mean, don't you get it?

01:11:22.810 --> 01:11:25.447
God is my enemy.

01:11:30.484 --> 01:11:32.020
It's okay.

01:11:35.122 --> 01:11:37.757
Lou, I know about the whiskey
bottle in the toilet tank.

01:11:37.759 --> 01:11:39.662
And the one under the sink.

01:11:42.463 --> 01:11:44.763
You can't have the life
you had before the war,

01:11:44.765 --> 01:11:46.367
so you've given up
on this one.

01:11:49.436 --> 01:11:52.373
On me, on Cissy,
on your family.

01:12:00.148 --> 01:12:02.083
You're not going to Japan.

01:12:03.851 --> 01:12:05.918
You're not gonna kill The Bird.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.389
It's a dream.

01:12:10.658 --> 01:12:12.494
It's a sickness.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.601
It's okay.

01:13:21.162 --> 01:13:25.665
Tonight our message is
gonna be brief.

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:27.666
Now, I always say that.

01:13:29.737 --> 01:13:31.870
So I don't want you
to get too hopeful, okay?

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:42.113
<i>This is the</i> Green Hornet.
<i>We're going down.</i>

01:13:42.115 --> 01:13:44.485
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

01:13:50.557 --> 01:13:53.625
There's a lifeline, and that's
the hand of Jesus to hold onto.

01:13:53.627 --> 01:13:57.799
I do not believe that any man,
that any man...

01:14:00.734 --> 01:14:04.003
<i>...without Jesus Christ.</i>

01:14:04.005 --> 01:14:06.272
<i>Your tremendous
marital problems,</i>

01:14:06.274 --> 01:14:09.741
<i>your physical problems,
your financial problems.</i>

01:14:09.743 --> 01:14:11.076
Help!

01:14:11.078 --> 01:14:15.514
<i>There are problems of sin
and habit that cannot be solved</i>

01:14:15.516 --> 01:14:17.650
<i>without the person of
our Lord Jesus Christ.</i>

01:14:17.652 --> 01:14:21.853
Have you trusted Christ Jesus
as savior?

01:14:21.855 --> 01:14:23.923
Tonight I'm glad to tell you

01:14:23.925 --> 01:14:29.131
<i>that the Lord Jesus can be
received, your sins forgiven...</i>

01:14:30.797 --> 01:14:32.964
your burdens lifted,

01:14:32.966 --> 01:14:37.570
your problems solved by
turning your life over to him

01:14:37.572 --> 01:14:41.743
<i>and repenting of your sin and
turnin' to Jesus Christ as savior.</i>

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:58.627
Louie, wake up.

01:14:59.793 --> 01:15:02.628
Louie. Louie.

01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:04.830
Louie, shh.

01:15:04.832 --> 01:15:06.831
Cissy's asleep.

01:15:06.833 --> 01:15:09.238
I love you.

01:15:10.971 --> 01:15:13.242
And I will not divorce you.

01:15:25.987 --> 01:15:27.823
You can leave Cissy.

01:15:33.261 --> 01:15:36.131
She's staying with Lila.

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:49.610
But you and I could go together.

01:16:01.956 --> 01:16:05.293
I don't know any other way
to help you, Louie.

01:16:07.028 --> 01:16:09.831
Please come with me.
Please.

01:16:14.135 --> 01:16:15.938
Just say, "Yes, dear."

01:16:23.711 --> 01:16:24.913
Yes, dear.

01:17:01.815 --> 01:17:07.820
<i>♪ Take it to the Lord
In prayer ♪</i>

01:17:07.822 --> 01:17:13.893
<i>♪ Do thy friends despise
Forsake thee ♪</i>

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:19.999
<i>♪ Take it to the Lord

<i>♪ Amen ♪</i>

01:17:45.292 --> 01:17:47.093
Good evening.

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:48.864
Not what you expected?

01:17:50.997 --> 01:17:55.034
The eighth chapter of John will be our
reading tonight, if you have your Bibles.

01:17:55.036 --> 01:17:57.268
And we begin reading.

01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:59.738
Jesus went unto
the Mount of Olives.

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.741
And early in the morning
he came again into the temple

01:18:02.743 --> 01:18:04.309
and all the people came to him,

01:18:04.311 --> 01:18:06.312
and he sat down under
the cover of darkness.

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:08.214
But let me tell you something.

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:10.415
Darkness does not hide
the eyes of God.

01:18:10.417 --> 01:18:14.285
God takes down your life from the time
you were born to the time you die.

01:18:14.287 --> 01:18:17.857
And when you stand before God
on that great judgment day,

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:20.925
you're gonna say, "Lord,
I'm not such a bad fellow."

01:18:20.927 --> 01:18:23.528
Then they're gonna
pull down the screen

01:18:23.530 --> 01:18:26.331
and they're gonna show
the moving picture of your life,

01:18:26.333 --> 01:18:29.235
and you're gonna hear every thought
that was goin' through your head

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:32.440
of every minute of every day, and
every second of every minute.

01:18:33.541 --> 01:18:36.040
And your own thoughts,
your own deeds,

01:18:36.042 --> 01:18:40.044
are gonna condemn you as you
stand before God on that day.

01:18:40.046 --> 01:18:42.180
And here tonight,

01:18:42.182 --> 01:18:44.183
there's a drowning man,

01:18:44.185 --> 01:18:48.320
a drowning woman, a drowning
boy, and a drowning girl,

01:18:48.322 --> 01:18:50.856
all lost on the sea
of life,

01:18:50.858 --> 01:18:52.924
not knowin' which way
to turn, but just looking...

01:18:52.926 --> 01:18:55.329
just looking for some
type of hope for the future.

01:18:57.931 --> 01:19:02.067
I don't care how dark or how
perplexing your problems might be.

01:19:02.069 --> 01:19:03.535
It makes no difference.

01:19:03.537 --> 01:19:07.074
Every problem solved,
every sin washed away.

01:19:10.478 --> 01:19:14.115
Just reach out
and take the hand of Jesus.

01:19:20.887 --> 01:19:24.956
I want everyone
to bow their heads

01:19:24.958 --> 01:19:26.827
and close your eyes.

01:19:52.987 --> 01:19:54.523
I'm sorry.

01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:22.884
Are you afraid, Lou?

01:20:26.654 --> 01:20:28.557
It's not gonna hurt you.

01:20:30.024 --> 01:20:32.194
You're not happy
the way you are.

01:20:33.159 --> 01:20:34.893
You want to change.

01:20:34.895 --> 01:20:38.530
You know, when he says,
"All heads bowed, all" whatever?

01:20:38.532 --> 01:20:41.200
- Eyes closed.
- Yeah. Well?

01:20:41.202 --> 01:20:43.104
See, they gotta be.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:48.577
Now, you wanna know why?

01:20:50.344 --> 01:20:52.447
You know, when I was a kid...

01:20:53.648 --> 01:20:57.316
and I went to those crummy,
lying revivals?

01:20:57.318 --> 01:20:58.587
I kept my eyes open...

01:21:00.587 --> 01:21:05.492
and so I got to see all the pickpockets
who were stealing from the chumps.

01:21:12.099 --> 01:21:13.935
Okay, here's a story.

01:21:15.202 --> 01:21:17.068
It's set in the future.

01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:18.603
Cissy is 15.

01:21:18.605 --> 01:21:23.545
She has her first boyfriend. He's a
good-lookin' kid, comes from a nice family.

01:21:25.645 --> 01:21:28.613
She brings him home one day
and doesn't tell us.

01:21:28.615 --> 01:21:32.351
They come through the door
and there you are,

01:21:32.353 --> 01:21:35.286
too drunk to remember that you're
supposed to hide in the bedroom

01:21:35.288 --> 01:21:37.157
so that nobody sees you.

01:21:40.027 --> 01:21:43.161
Instead, you start showing him
your notebooks.

01:21:43.163 --> 01:21:45.097
Naturally,
the kid tries to get away,

01:21:45.099 --> 01:21:49.503
but you hang on breathing
alcohol in his face.

01:21:51.238 --> 01:21:56.141
And your daughter,
the light of your life,

01:21:56.143 --> 01:21:59.980
the little baby that you wouldn't
let anybody else touch...

01:22:02.682 --> 01:22:07.188
she is so ashamed of her father
that she wants to die.

01:22:14.395 --> 01:22:16.260
<i>Why, you ask yourself,</i>

01:22:16.262 --> 01:22:20.199
why is God silent
while good men suffer?

01:22:20.201 --> 01:22:22.134
Why doesn't he stop
the pestilence?

01:22:22.136 --> 01:22:24.570
Why doesn't he stop
the wars?

01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:28.440
Why doesn't he stop
the suffering in this world?

01:22:28.442 --> 01:22:33.211
Well, that is the question that has mystified
people from generation to generation.

01:22:33.213 --> 01:22:36.014
If you look into
the heavens tonight,

01:22:36.016 --> 01:22:38.049
on this beautiful
California night,

01:22:38.051 --> 01:22:43.388
I can see the stars and I can
see the footprints of God.

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.727
And I say to myself,
"My father, my heavenly father,

01:22:48.729 --> 01:22:51.429
- he hung them there with his flaming fingertip...
- Yes.

01:22:51.431 --> 01:22:54.599
and he holds them there by the
power of his omnipotent hand."

01:22:54.601 --> 01:22:56.434
Amen.

01:22:56.436 --> 01:22:59.204
What God asks of men
is faith.

01:22:59.206 --> 01:23:02.508
You can't see him,
you can't hear him.

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:04.375
God makes himself unseen.

01:23:04.377 --> 01:23:06.711
But I believe that God is
still performing miracles.

01:23:06.713 --> 01:23:08.147
Amen!

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:10.182
I believe that God is
still healing bodies.

01:23:10.184 --> 01:23:12.317
I believe that God is
still healing hearts.

01:23:12.319 --> 01:23:15.320
I believe that God is
still transforming lives.

01:23:15.322 --> 01:23:16.588
Amen.

01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:17.723
And he says to each of us,

01:23:17.725 --> 01:23:22.197
"If you suffer, I'll give you
the grace to go forward."

01:23:23.596 --> 01:23:25.464
But because
you can't hear him,

01:23:25.466 --> 01:23:28.200
because you can't see him
in his silent of heaven...

01:23:28.202 --> 01:23:30.436
- Amen.
- you turn away from him.

01:23:30.438 --> 01:23:33.104
And let me tell you, brother, that's
the most dangerous place to be,

01:23:33.106 --> 01:23:36.340
to sit there day after day,
and never accept salvation.

01:23:36.342 --> 01:23:39.745
- Amen.
- Hardening your soul day after day, night after night,

01:23:39.747 --> 01:23:41.746
- until it's too late.
- Yes.

01:23:41.748 --> 01:23:44.817
That God cannot even reach
into your heart of hearts

01:23:44.819 --> 01:23:47.218
and save you from yourself.

01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:48.286
Amen!

01:23:50.557 --> 01:23:55.662
I want everyone to bow their
heads, close your eyes.

01:24:12.212 --> 01:24:13.113
Lou.

01:24:16.283 --> 01:24:17.786
Don't leave!

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:22.823
You can leave while I'm
preaching, but not now.

01:24:51.284 --> 01:24:52.851
If you save me...

01:24:52.853 --> 01:24:55.256
<i>Look at me.</i>

01:25:00.293 --> 01:25:01.829
Look at me.

01:25:05.298 --> 01:25:06.568
No.

01:25:11.372 --> 01:25:13.374
Look at me.

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:19.180
Look at me!

01:25:40.466 --> 01:25:42.769
This is it.

01:25:43.770 --> 01:25:45.773
God has spoken to you.

01:25:53.479 --> 01:25:56.283
It is time.
Come on.

01:26:05.225 --> 01:26:06.894
If you save me...

01:26:08.962 --> 01:26:11.431
I will serve you forever.

01:27:46.592 --> 01:27:48.528
He kept me alive...

01:27:49.662 --> 01:27:51.565
through everything...

01:27:53.667 --> 01:27:55.003
for this.

01:29:23.957 --> 01:29:25.626
The war is over.

01:29:47.648 --> 01:29:49.384
Where's Watanabe?

01:29:51.717 --> 01:29:53.688
Where's The Bird?

01:29:55.087 --> 01:29:57.023
We're pretty sure
he's still alive.

01:29:58.725 --> 01:30:00.995
We will keep
lookin' for him, Captain.

01:30:08.202 --> 01:30:09.670
Then do me a favor.

01:30:13.172 --> 01:30:15.041
If he ever turns up...

01:30:17.944 --> 01:30:20.046
will you give him this
for me?

01:30:23.617 --> 01:30:27.486
Tell him to take a look at
Matthew, chapter six, verse 14.

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:31.159
"For if you forgive other people
when they sin against you...

01:30:33.025 --> 01:30:35.630
your heavenly father
will also forgive you."

01:30:47.006 --> 01:30:48.509
It's okay.

01:30:51.011 --> 01:30:52.647
It's okay.

01:30:59.987 --> 01:31:01.588
It's over.

01:31:05.158 --> 01:31:06.894
It's over.

01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:12.466
It's gonna be okay.
I forgive you.

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:19.606
I forgive you. God bless you.

01:31:20.606 --> 01:31:21.805
It's okay.

01:31:21.807 --> 01:31:23.808
Okay?
<i>Hai.</i>

01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:26.044
God bless you.

01:31:26.046 --> 01:31:27.248
It's okay.

01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:30.217
It's okay.

01:31:31.083 --> 01:31:32.787
I forgive you.

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:36.153
God bless you.

01:31:36.155 --> 01:31:38.022
God bless you.

01:31:38.024 --> 01:31:39.723
It's okay.

01:31:39.725 --> 01:31:40.862
I forgive you.

01:31:42.095 --> 01:31:43.928
It's over.
I forgive you.

01:31:43.930 --> 01:31:45.229
It's okay.

01:31:45.231 --> 01:31:47.635
God bless you, sir.

01:32:39.786 --> 01:32:44.155
During the war, Louis Zamperini
was an American war hero.

01:32:44.157 --> 01:32:48.860
He was 47 days on a life raft
floating around in the Pacific.

01:32:48.862 --> 01:32:50.995
And he began to drink
when he came home,

01:32:50.997 --> 01:32:55.165
and he was confused and frustrated
and mixed up in his life.

01:32:55.167 --> 01:32:57.635
And he, too,
wandered into that tent

01:32:57.637 --> 01:33:00.071
on Washington and Hill
in Los Angeles

01:33:00.073 --> 01:33:02.007
and found Christ
as his savior.

01:33:02.009 --> 01:33:04.275
And tonight
he is the director

01:33:04.277 --> 01:33:09.313
of the Victory Boys Camp for
juvenile delinquents in Los Angeles,

01:33:09.315 --> 01:33:14.986
giving his full life now to try to
rehabilitate juvenile delinquents

01:33:14.988 --> 01:33:17.789
and lead them to a knowledge
of Jesus Christ.

01:33:17.791 --> 01:33:20.959
Louis, we're delighted to
have you with us tonight.

01:33:20.961 --> 01:33:22.427
Thank you, Billy.

01:33:22.429 --> 01:33:26.330
It was after the war and with
about $10,000 in back pay

01:33:26.332 --> 01:33:28.433
from two and a half years
in prison camp

01:33:28.435 --> 01:33:33.237
and also, uh, collecting my
life insurance for being dead,

01:33:33.239 --> 01:33:38.375
I became extremely selfish,
cynical, and greedy

01:33:38.377 --> 01:33:43.048
until the, uh, wind was finally
let out of my sails.

01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:47.986
I lost everything that I possessed
outside of my wife and little girl,

01:33:47.988 --> 01:33:52.257
and it was then that my wife
was able to persuade me

01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:54.992
into going down
to that meeting.

01:33:54.994 --> 01:33:58.698
I asked the Lord Jesus Christ to
come into my heart and save me.

01:33:59.466 --> 01:34:01.802
And, of course, he did.

01:34:06.976 --> 01:34:11.976

01:35:31.557 --> 01:35:33.857
These are kids
that quit high school.

01:35:33.859 --> 01:35:36.059
They haven't
accomplished anything.

01:35:36.061 --> 01:35:37.829
So I have a chart

01:35:37.831 --> 01:35:41.398
that all during the week they
gotta pass everything, boating...

01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:43.867
And I get 'em up on the top
of the mountain

01:35:43.869 --> 01:35:46.103
and teach them glacial
survival and rescue,

01:35:46.105 --> 01:35:48.408
so that at the end of
the week I show the kids...

01:35:49.909 --> 01:35:52.309
"Look at the things you've
accomplished all week.

01:35:52.311 --> 01:35:54.012
They weren't easy.

01:35:54.014 --> 01:35:56.380
It shows that you can accomplish
anything you want.

01:35:56.382 --> 01:35:59.483
Now, you go back
and finish your time

01:35:59.485 --> 01:36:02.286
and then go back and
get your high school diploma

01:36:02.288 --> 01:36:06.223
and that's the first big
accomplishment of your life."

01:36:06.225 --> 01:36:10.093
While I was still on my knees, my
life changed in a matter of moments,

01:36:10.095 --> 01:36:12.930
because I knew I was
through getting drunk,

01:36:12.932 --> 01:36:15.834
and I knew that
I forgave my guards,

01:36:15.836 --> 01:36:19.437
and I knew it was a miracle
because I forgave The Bird.

01:36:19.439 --> 01:36:22.240
And that was
the first night,

01:36:22.242 --> 01:36:26.277
first night in two and a half
years I didn't have a nightmare,

01:36:26.279 --> 01:36:28.580
and I haven't had one since.

01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:30.882
Forgiveness
must be complete.

01:36:30.884 --> 01:36:33.483
Uh, no matter
who the person is.

01:36:33.485 --> 01:36:36.854
And I've had a few enemies,
even the last few years,

01:36:36.856 --> 01:36:41.558
and the only way I can forgive 'em is
to pray for 'em, and that's what I do.

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.995
Instead of hatin' 'em
I pray for 'em.

01:36:43.997 --> 01:36:47.168
You just have to buckle up
and go onto greater things.

01:36:49.903 --> 01:36:51.936
The guy says, "Aren't you...

01:36:51.938 --> 01:36:54.539
Aren't you the guy that spent
47 days on a raft?"

01:36:54.541 --> 01:36:56.174
I said, "Yeah."

01:36:56.176 --> 01:36:59.343
He says, "You're
entitled to travel pay."

01:36:59.345 --> 01:37:02.347
I said, "What?"
He said...

01:37:02.349 --> 01:37:05.016
That's a very
efficient guy.

01:37:05.018 --> 01:37:10.888
He said, "Seven dollars
and 60 cents a day times 47."

01:37:10.890 --> 01:37:13.958
He made out a bill,
mailed it to Washington,

01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:18.028
and a week later
we got a response,

01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:20.197
and it said,

01:37:20.199 --> 01:37:23.300
uh, "Request denied.

01:37:23.302 --> 01:37:26.638
Reason:
travel unauthorized."
