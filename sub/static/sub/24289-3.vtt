WEBVTT

00:10.552 --> 00:12.054
Okay, so.

00:12.554 --> 00:15.057
Here's Vector firing his code disruptor.

00:16.058 --> 00:17.935
He's nailing targets left and right.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.188
And here's D-Frag with his frag fists,

00:21.897 --> 00:22.981
bringing the thunder.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.816
I'm all about the thunder.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.027
And nobody can fling
energy shurikens

00:27.110 --> 00:28.862
like Enigma can.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.822
It's all in the wrist.

00:30.906 --> 00:31.907
Nice.

00:34.660 --> 00:35.786
And then there's me.

00:35.869 --> 00:36.912
Googz.

00:36.995 --> 00:40.040
Now, what is Googz doing?

00:40.123 --> 00:41.208
Anybody? Anybody?

00:41.500 --> 00:42.626
He's scanning.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.044
Thank you.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.338
I think I made my point.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.924
I fail to see a point, Parker.

00:49.007 --> 00:50.401
You have simply listed attributes...

00:50.425 --> 00:51.426
Well, it's a comparison.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.720
Don't you think Googz should
get a weapons upgrade?

00:54.054 --> 00:55.931
New offensive powers will not be unlocked

00:56.014 --> 00:58.517
until you reach
your next proficiency level.

01:01.270 --> 01:03.230
You already have the best weapon, anyway.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.607
You have a brain, right?

01:06.066 --> 01:08.735
You were gonna say my brain?

01:08.819 --> 01:09.987
Yeah, I was.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.989
Now, I need some volunteers.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.657
My mom has called a family game night.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.993
It will be Vera's first.

01:20.497 --> 01:21.623
What're you doing?

01:23.584 --> 01:24.751
I am in training.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.296
I have pens, pencils,
a collection of dice,

01:27.379 --> 01:29.214
and I have downloaded strategy guides

01:29.298 --> 01:31.508
for 841 games of chance and skill.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.677
I will not be defeated!

01:35.721 --> 01:38.140
Yeah, she's been doing that all day.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.976
So, who's gonna help me out?

01:41.059 --> 01:42.978
Get in on some family game night action?

01:43.520 --> 01:46.690
Sorry, I've gotta edit vlog footage.

01:46.773 --> 01:47.941
I have curfew.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.820
Otherwise, I'd totally be there.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.071
For real.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.908
What about you, Parker?

01:57.576 --> 01:58.994
You in?

01:59.620 --> 02:00.871
You love family game night.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.164
Be on Vera's team.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.916
Yeah, no, uh, not tonight.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.961
I'm gonna stay here and do my homework.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.297
It's Friday. You have all weekend.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.257
You know, us brainy types, right?

02:12.633 --> 02:14.301
Yeah, okay.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.386
Knock yourself out.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.804
Let's go, Vera.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.097
Goodbye, Parker.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.099
Too bad you won't be there to see me

02:21.183 --> 02:23.143
crush Austin and Judy,

02:23.226 --> 02:24.936
but I hope you have a productive night.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.410 --> 02:41.578
Let's see here.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.163
First thing's first.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.917
Ditch my imaging capacitor.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.044
I can code its function into my head.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.672
Move this here,

02:53.465 --> 02:55.384
that goes there...

02:58.553 --> 02:59.763
Yeah.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.890
This is much better.

03:10.649 --> 03:11.900
Hmm.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.656
The Fortress Command game. That's perfect.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.379
I can just test my new offensive upgrades

03:19.449 --> 03:21.201
on a bunch of harmless game sentinels.

03:22.744 --> 03:23.912
Huh.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.497
Sweet.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.682
Warning! Incoming virus!

03:46.852 --> 03:49.521
Ah, a sentinel army.

03:49.604 --> 03:53.525
Just what I need to conquer
and rule Cyberspace.

03:53.608 --> 03:54.776
Stop!

03:54.860 --> 03:56.445
And kneel before me.

04:03.827 --> 04:08.582
Your kind will obey me
once I take control of your fortress.

04:15.714 --> 04:19.760
Stand aside and let your new master pass.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.478
Excellent.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.041
All right.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.460
Time to put my new weapons
upgrade to the test.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.795
Portal blaster!

04:57.047 --> 04:58.215
Whoa!

05:03.970 --> 05:04.971
Five against one?

05:05.055 --> 05:06.306
No problem.

05:06.681 --> 05:07.849
Targets engaged.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.104
Yes! Quintuple strike.

05:14.356 --> 05:15.357
Whoa.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.276
The portal blaster is drawing
way more power

05:18.360 --> 05:19.694
than I thought it would.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.780
I'll make some adjustments
when I get back.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.410
Your facial expression
suggests malnourishment

05:27.494 --> 05:29.538
and your body movement is repetitive.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.915
Are you a GIF of an underfed wombat?

05:31.998 --> 05:33.124
Hmm?

05:33.208 --> 05:34.709
Vera, there are no GIFs.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.294
You just have to guess what she is.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.004
Okay.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.214
Uh...

05:42.092 --> 05:44.177
Your bulging eyes
are an excellent clue, Judy.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.762
My guess is trumpet player.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.222
No!

05:47.305 --> 05:48.848
Vera.

05:48.932 --> 05:49.975
It's an animal.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.269
The answer is always an animal.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.895
Thank you for that clarification.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.149
Uh... Sploosh, sploosh.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.318
Sploosh. Sploosh.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.529
Okay. I know it now.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.864
Googz's power level is at 55 percent.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.492
Say again?

06:07.576 --> 06:09.077
Fish. You are a fish.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.288
Likely a copper nose or a gilt-head brine.

06:11.371 --> 06:15.000
You're right, but I think
just fish is good enough.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.878
I can smell victory!

06:18.962 --> 06:21.506
No, those are my bacon
chocolate chip cookies.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.885
What's going on?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.388
Judy is retrieving the cookies.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.931
You should pay more attention.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.726
No, what did you say about Googz?

06:33.435 --> 06:35.186
Googz is in Cyberspace.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.023
I did not authorize this mission.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.774
That is so not cool.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.860
Tell him to get back here right now.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.613
I can only communicate
with him from Room Zero.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.175
Well, then that's where we have to go.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.826
But first we have to ditch my mom.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.705
Hey, hey, you two,
no whispers or colluding

06:53.788 --> 06:55.457
on family game night.

06:55.540 --> 06:59.085
I was just, uh, telling Vera
how amazing your cookies are.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.714
It's the hospital.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.966
I'm on call. I have to go in.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.259
What? Now?

07:06.343 --> 07:07.743
In the middle of family game night?

07:07.802 --> 07:10.430
Sorry, we're just gonna have
to do this another night.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.516
Sorry.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.687
Did you send that text?

07:17.771 --> 07:18.897
Yes.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.483
That is what you requested, isn't it?

07:22.067 --> 07:23.526
Yeah, I guess so.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.613
Now, let's get to Room Zero
and find out what Parker is up to.

07:27.697 --> 07:28.698
Oh, yeah.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.868
Googz 2.0 is on fire.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.244
<i>Hey!</i>

07:34.287 --> 07:36.164
What's that weirdo doing in my game?

07:36.247 --> 07:37.749
Now I gotta re-spawn.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.587
A throne room.

07:43.171 --> 07:47.550
Rather basic at the moment,
but once I renovate...

07:48.343 --> 07:50.178
Halt! Intruder!

07:51.304 --> 07:52.430
Quite the contrary.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.726
You will bow down to your new master.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.043
Boot thrusters!

08:22.919 --> 08:24.504
Whoa!

08:27.465 --> 08:29.676
Did I just level up?

08:30.385 --> 08:31.469
Awesome!

08:32.261 --> 08:33.554
The fragging continues.

08:39.309 --> 08:40.477
Attention!

08:42.397 --> 08:43.898
Present arms!

08:45.817 --> 08:48.653
Ah, a tad slow.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.866
Perhaps a bath in my digital acid pool

08:52.949 --> 08:55.952
will melt your code
into something more useful.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.170
Excellent.

09:05.253 --> 09:09.007
A scepter befitting a ruler of my stature.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.967
Now, let's do this once more!

09:11.051 --> 09:13.511
With absolute precision this time.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.057
Much better.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.119
I knew he was up to something earlier.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.561
He had that look.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.938
It was a mistake
to leave him here unsupervised.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.690
I won't let it happen again.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.319
What's that on his back?

09:29.903 --> 09:33.031
It appears to be an unapproved
weapons modification.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.383
What's his power level at?

09:34.407 --> 09:35.992
21 percent.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.788
Googz, report immediately.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.539
<i>Hey Vera.</i>

09:41.623 --> 09:42.933
<i>Uh, sorry, my comm's not working too good.</i>

09:42.957 --> 09:44.334
<i>Lots of static for some reason.</i>

09:44.459 --> 09:46.729
<i>Anyway, I'm just in the codec
doing some research. What's up?</i>

09:46.753 --> 09:47.754
Dude, we can see you.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.048
<i>Oh, right.</i>

09:50.131 --> 09:52.717
<i>- Uh... Hey.</i>
- Parker.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.719
You know that Guardian rule number seven

09:54.803 --> 09:57.555
is never go in Cyberspace
without my authorization.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.140
<i>Yeah, I know, I know, I'm...</i>

09:59.224 --> 10:01.601
Get back here now or else
I'm coming in to get you.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.061
<i>Relax, Austin.</i>

10:03.144 --> 10:04.562
Everything's fine.

10:04.646 --> 10:07.190
Unless you're the player
I'm about to frag.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.192
<i>Game over.</i>

10:09.275 --> 10:11.069
This is so not fair.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.908
Okay buddy, your power level
is down to ten percent.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.952
<i>Okay, okay, I'll head back.</i>

10:29.003 --> 10:30.839
What is this?

10:31.464 --> 10:34.050
A Guardian, alone?

10:34.134 --> 10:35.426
Bring him to me!

10:35.510 --> 10:36.845
Yes, Megabyte.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.528
Austin? Vera?

10:53.611 --> 10:55.280
There's something wrong. These...

10:55.363 --> 10:56.614
These sentinels are different

10:56.698 --> 10:58.032
than the other ones in the game.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.246
I'm going in.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.706
Call Tamra and Trey.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.303
Zip board!

11:24.100 --> 11:25.101
Over clock!

11:32.150 --> 11:34.611
No! Whoa!

11:35.194 --> 11:37.572
Vera, they've got Googz in the fortress.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.657
Tell D-Frag and Enigma to hurry.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.701
I'll meet them back in the codec.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.378
What a fortunate turn of events.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.256
- Megabyte.
- For me, that is.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.760
I could delete you,
but you have more value as bait

11:58.843 --> 12:01.429
to catch those other pesky Guardians.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.615
Well, that's where you're wrong,

12:02.639 --> 12:04.783
because I've gone solo
and there's no one coming to get me.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.184
Portal blaster!

12:11.856 --> 12:13.399
How pathetic.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.401
Throw him in the dungeon.

12:18.696 --> 12:19.989
Let go!

12:20.073 --> 12:22.659
Get your hands off me,
you oversized digital apes!

12:37.507 --> 12:38.591
Ow.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.638
Austin, Vera, come in.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.057
Nothing.

12:51.562 --> 12:52.981
That's not good.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.399
That's not good.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.611
Emergency power mode initiated.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.322
Emergency power mode?

13:01.823 --> 13:03.116
Your suits are made of code

13:03.199 --> 13:05.785
that requires a minimum power level
for stability.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.830
If the power level falls
below five percent

13:08.913 --> 13:10.832
your suits switch to EPM.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.954
To conserve energy, Googz's
cyber suit will slow down

13:14.002 --> 13:15.461
his heart rate and breathing

13:15.545 --> 13:17.463
until he is in a sleep-like state.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.216
- What, like hibernation?
- Yes.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.469
And if the power level
bottoms out at zero?

13:23.886 --> 13:26.264
The suit's code will start to self-delete.

13:26.347 --> 13:29.267
Unless it is recharged, exposure occurs.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.227
And exposure means?

13:31.310 --> 13:32.478
Pain.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.106
Then eventually... Death.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.108
<i>Enough with the gory details.</i>

13:37.191 --> 13:40.194
<i>Just get in here and let's save
Googz before that happens.</i>

13:55.001 --> 13:56.586
We have to get inside that fortress.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.962
And how are we gonna do that?

13:58.046 --> 14:00.339
It's not like knocking on
the front door is an option.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.467
<i>No, it's not.</i>

14:07.555 --> 14:08.848
All right, flip it, Vera.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.725
Initiating codec rotation.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.437
Whoa.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.490
Cyber hook!

14:27.617 --> 14:29.243
Take it away, Vera.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.751
Come on.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.217
D-Frag, stop fooling around.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.885
I'm not. I'm actually stuck.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.178
Power surge!

14:51.057 --> 14:53.768
Do you even understand
the concept of stealth?

14:53.851 --> 14:55.978
Huh? Oh, right.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.480
Whatever. Let's go.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.737
That must be where they've got Googz.

15:09.492 --> 15:11.202
Okay, that was stealthy.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.456
Googz's power level is down to 1 percent.

15:15.540 --> 15:16.541
<i>Hurry.</i>

15:16.624 --> 15:18.084
Bash tagger!

15:20.294 --> 15:21.730
We have to boost his cyber suit.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.298
I'm low on power
but you two have plenty to spare.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.134
Network!

15:35.393 --> 15:36.853
This better work.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.113
Austin?

15:47.572 --> 15:48.990
I knew you'd come for me.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.575
But so did Megabyte.

15:50.658 --> 15:51.701
Megabyte?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.035
Is he still around?

15:53.119 --> 15:54.763
Yeah, and he threw me
in here to catch you guys.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.913
We gotta go!

15:57.373 --> 15:59.417
Whoa, uh, not this way.

16:05.673 --> 16:06.757
I've got this.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.009
Portal blaster!

16:09.969 --> 16:11.679
Ugh. Not again.

16:12.722 --> 16:13.973
Code disruptor!

16:15.641 --> 16:17.935
Uh, not this way, either.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.062
Everybody back to the tunnel. Now!

16:25.485 --> 16:27.278
We're running out of options.

16:33.618 --> 16:34.785
Follow me.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.305
How did you know
that door was there?

16:44.462 --> 16:46.130
I scanned the wall.

16:46.214 --> 16:47.632
Smart move.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.966
This way.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.486
The sentinels won't be able
to get up the stairs.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.594
Whoa!

16:53.054 --> 16:54.305
You were saying?

17:01.145 --> 17:02.230
Oh, no!

17:07.777 --> 17:09.654
Oh, Guardians.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.696
How predictable.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.407
What do you think of my new fortress?

17:14.492 --> 17:15.660
Pretty impressive.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.036
Except it's not yours.

17:17.118 --> 17:19.038
It belongs to the Fortress Command game.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.289
It did.

17:20.373 --> 17:24.001
But that was before
I took possession of it.

17:24.752 --> 17:28.047
My only decision now
is what to do with you four.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.135
Perhaps I will mount your heads
on my wall.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.682
A weak spot in the wall.

17:37.765 --> 17:41.686
Then again I could dip you
into my digital acid pool

17:41.769 --> 17:43.771
and watch you disintegrate.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.332
Everybody get ready.

17:45.356 --> 17:46.857
- Ready for what?
- This!

17:46.941 --> 17:48.568
- Googz, no!
- Fool!

17:55.658 --> 17:56.993
It worked!

17:57.076 --> 17:58.077
Argh!

18:03.749 --> 18:04.917
You okay, Googz?

18:05.001 --> 18:06.544
Yeah. Firewall!

18:17.555 --> 18:18.639
Whoa!

18:18.723 --> 18:21.726
You're not going anywhere,
little Guardian.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.144
Vera, delete my upgrades.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.746
- <i>Right now?</i>
- Yes. Right now. Do it!

18:24.770 --> 18:25.771
Okay.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.190
Deletion of upgrades initiated.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.775
Whoa!

18:30.192 --> 18:31.736
Gotcha.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.782
So long, Megadork.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.635
That went pretty well, right?

18:58.054 --> 18:59.096
Sort of well?

18:59.180 --> 19:02.433
You were seconds away
from your suit starting to decode.

19:04.018 --> 19:07.480
Okay... But it didn't, right?
So that's a positive.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.024
Maybe.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.443
Parker.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.445
You broke Guardian rule number seven.

19:14.987 --> 19:18.324
You entered Cyberspace
with unauthorized upgrades.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.910
You put yourself and the others
in jeopardy.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.623
But you also exhibited
excellent composure under pressure

19:26.332 --> 19:29.251
and executed a daring escape
from Megabyte's fortress.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.838
So, even though I am not
programmed to upgrade

19:32.922 --> 19:34.298
your weapons at this time,

19:35.675 --> 19:38.344
I believe you have proven
your earlier point.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.054
Googz now has a deflector ring

19:40.137 --> 19:43.474
that provides both offensive
and defensive capabilities.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.267
That's way cool.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.853
Thanks, Vera.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.773
But you must promise
to never enter Cyberspace again

19:50.856 --> 19:52.441
without authorization.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.776
I promise.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.112
I owe you guys big time.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.824
What can I do to pay you back
for saving my life?

19:59.907 --> 20:01.701
Well, I could use some help with calculus.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.244
Sure.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.121
Calculus tutoring for a whole month.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.500
For the year.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.836
Okay. Yeah, sure.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.423
What about you, Tamra?

20:15.506 --> 20:19.427
Well, my <i>Tamra Says</i> page
is getting a little stale.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.637
How about fixing me up
with some new features?

20:21.721 --> 20:23.305
Yeah, anything you need.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.391
That'll be a good place to start.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.601
I'll let you know when your debt is paid.

20:31.647 --> 20:32.982
What about you, Austin?

20:33.733 --> 20:34.942
How can I pay you back?

20:43.409 --> 20:45.244
Are you sure it's not a frog?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.372
- Lemur.
- Lemur?

21:00.050 --> 21:01.761
<i>Eliminating these new Guardians</i>

21:01.844 --> 21:05.055
<i>may be more difficult
than I had anticipated.</i>

21:06.515 --> 21:10.603
But I will learn their weaknesses
and exploit them!

21:10.686 --> 21:15.649
Nothing will foil my plans
to dominate all of Cyberspace!
