00:12.788 --> 00:16.101
NSA reports easing
of hostile chatter inside VAJA,

00:16.125 --> 00:19.271
so the Eli Volk incident
is in the rearview for now,

00:19.295 --> 00:21.773
though noise continues
over Reza Mousavi's detention

00:21.797 --> 00:23.775
and ongoing sanctions.

00:23.799 --> 00:28.246
Finally, ma'am, DIA reports that
a Chinese light frigate warship

00:28.270 --> 00:30.949
fired warning shots
at a Russian-flagged oil tanker

00:30.973 --> 00:32.417
in the South China Sea,

00:32.441 --> 00:33.785
forcing it to reroute away

00:33.809 --> 00:36.087
from internationally
recognized shipping lanes.

00:36.111 --> 00:38.023
As established by the Singapore
Interchange you negotiated

00:38.047 --> 00:40.358
less than four years ago, ma'am.

00:40.382 --> 00:42.928
RUSSELL: But since Russia wasn't
part of the accord, they...

00:42.952 --> 00:46.431
Moscow has been working
with Vietnam to exploit

00:46.455 --> 00:49.401
disputed oil and natural gas rights.

00:49.425 --> 00:52.604
So Beijing seized
on a-a political gray area

00:52.628 --> 00:54.105
to give the Heisman
to Russia's efforts?

00:54.129 --> 00:55.707
- Not exactly shocking.
- HILL: True.

00:55.731 --> 00:58.543
But recent surveillance photos
show an alarming buildup

00:58.567 --> 01:03.648
of Chinese military personnel
on one island in particular.

01:03.672 --> 01:04.983
Hainan Dao.

01:05.007 --> 01:06.718
Well, even naming it
breaks the spirit,

01:06.742 --> 01:08.520
if not the letter, of the treaty.

01:08.544 --> 01:11.423
- Thank you.
- So, basically,

01:11.447 --> 01:13.959
just another beautiful day
in the neighborhood.

01:13.983 --> 01:15.594
(LAUGHTER)

01:15.618 --> 01:18.363
Ellen, when was our last naval flyby

01:18.387 --> 01:20.265
- near Hainan Dao?
- Couple of weeks ago.

01:20.289 --> 01:24.269
We usually go for one a month,
keep them honest.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.938
Let's move the next one
up. Soon as possible.

01:26.962 --> 01:28.974
I don't want Beijing
getting comfortable

01:28.998 --> 01:31.209
bullying other countries
in international waters.

01:31.233 --> 01:33.645
HILL: Yes, ma'am.

01:33.669 --> 01:35.319
Look, I...

01:36.839 --> 01:42.220
I know that the impeachment
hearing is on everybody's mind.

01:42.244 --> 01:45.123
I've been going
about business as usual

01:45.147 --> 01:48.059
because I do truly believe

01:48.083 --> 01:50.662
that it is best for
U.S. interests here

01:50.686 --> 01:52.163
and abroad.

01:52.187 --> 01:55.834
Anybody disagrees or has any concerns,

01:55.858 --> 01:57.875
I'm all ears.

02:00.429 --> 02:02.407
Okay. Thank you, everyone.

02:02.431 --> 02:04.282
- Thank you, ma'am.
- (OTHERS MURMURING)

02:09.538 --> 02:10.882
So... (SIGHS)

02:10.906 --> 02:13.151
House Judiciary just
scheduled your appearance

02:13.175 --> 02:15.820
before the committee.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.155
Day after tomorrow.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.690
- Good.
- MIKE: Not good.

02:18.714 --> 02:20.792
Bad. Apocalyptically bad.

02:20.816 --> 02:23.395
Hanson's out there whipping
the press into a lather

02:23.419 --> 02:24.796
over you wagging the dog with Iran

02:24.820 --> 02:26.498
and collusion and nepotism

02:26.522 --> 02:29.034
and, I don't know,
sorcery and cannibalism.

02:29.058 --> 02:31.436
Your numbers are eroding
by the hour and you're about

02:31.460 --> 02:34.005
- to step into the Star Chamber.
- I know, Mike.

02:34.029 --> 02:36.211
MIKE: Then do something about it.
You're losing the public.

02:36.212 --> 02:38.176
Use the bully pulpit

02:38.200 --> 02:39.344
to bully the crap out of them.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.246
Congress has the right to investigate.

02:41.270 --> 02:43.381
Not to defame. Not to lie.
Not to attack...

02:43.405 --> 02:45.817
You show me where in the
Constitution it says they don't.

02:45.841 --> 02:47.919
I am not going to attack Congress,

02:47.943 --> 02:51.389
no matter how much I deplore Hanson

02:51.413 --> 02:53.258
and Canning's tactics.

02:53.282 --> 02:55.827
- How's the whip count?
- Not good.

02:55.851 --> 02:59.064
If the House voted today, they'd
have impeachment by two votes.

02:59.088 --> 03:02.200
MIKE: And the Senate will convict,
making you the first president

03:02.224 --> 03:04.603
to be removed from office.

03:04.627 --> 03:06.204
Hell, even Congressman Weenie

03:06.228 --> 03:08.440
- is sitting this one out.
- Yeah, what about Heeney?

03:08.464 --> 03:11.076
You know? We ever figure out
why he's being so timid?

03:11.100 --> 03:13.745
MIKE: He's quoted in the <i>Chronicle</i>
piece saying he's simply

03:13.769 --> 03:16.247
"acceding to the chairman
and his Article One duty."

03:16.271 --> 03:17.582
Which makes me think

03:17.606 --> 03:21.252
Canning or Hanson
or one of their stooges

03:21.276 --> 03:23.121
has something on the good congressman.

03:23.145 --> 03:24.589
I could get into it.

03:24.613 --> 03:25.957
ELIZABETH: Russell,

03:25.981 --> 03:28.827
- what's next?
- RUSSELL: Uh, NEC roundtable

03:28.851 --> 03:30.729
in the Roosevelt Room.

03:30.753 --> 03:32.236
Okay.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.973
â™ª

03:40.496 --> 03:42.474
HENRY: There's leftover tempeh tacos.

03:42.498 --> 03:44.809
Well, they're not
really tacos. They're...

03:44.833 --> 03:47.679
uh, just these
shell-like things and...

03:47.703 --> 03:49.981
Gee, when you put it like that...

03:50.005 --> 03:51.316
- You want to come up?
- No.

03:51.340 --> 03:53.151
Kind of want to stay here

03:53.175 --> 03:55.153
while I still can. (CHUCKLES)

03:55.177 --> 03:56.621
You want company?

03:56.645 --> 03:58.129
(QUIETLY): Yeah.

04:01.517 --> 04:05.864
I know that this is hard on you, too.

04:05.888 --> 04:08.366
Well, only when I see them
go after you.

04:08.390 --> 04:10.168
Politics ain't beanbag.

04:10.192 --> 04:13.144
Yeah, but it ain't supposed to
be <i>The Hunger Games,</i> either.

04:14.663 --> 04:16.975
Go home, Blake!

04:16.999 --> 04:19.444
BLAKE: Not while
you're still here, ma'am!

04:19.468 --> 04:21.446
I am still here,

04:21.470 --> 04:23.081
aren't I?

04:23.105 --> 04:24.315
Yeah, it would seem so.

04:24.339 --> 04:26.651
You know, I once read that
you can effect more change

04:26.675 --> 04:29.554
in a day as president than you can

04:29.578 --> 04:31.089
for the rest of your life
after you leave office.

04:31.113 --> 04:33.358
I believe that.

04:33.382 --> 04:35.393
So, let's make a bucket list.

04:35.417 --> 04:39.330
E-Everything that we want to do...

04:39.354 --> 04:42.300
before we leave here.

04:42.324 --> 04:45.203
Okay... oh, oh.
I've always wanted to...

04:45.227 --> 04:47.038
(QUIETLY):
sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom.

04:47.062 --> 04:49.207
- Does that count?
- Okay, yeah.

04:49.231 --> 04:51.710
- (LAUGHS): Yeah.
- Not that it's gonna effect any change...

04:51.734 --> 04:53.211
It will for us.

04:53.235 --> 04:55.380
- Tonight.
- Mm-hmm.

04:55.404 --> 04:59.350
I have always wanted to answer calls

04:59.374 --> 05:01.386
at the White House switchboard.

05:01.410 --> 05:03.154
There's a switchboard?

05:03.178 --> 05:04.489
I don't know.

05:04.513 --> 05:07.926
Where the calls come in.
I want to take calls.

05:07.950 --> 05:10.161
Gun control? Can...
I mean, is that too big?

05:10.185 --> 05:11.329
No.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.731
Are you kidding? It's our list.

05:12.755 --> 05:14.132
We can do whatever we want.

05:14.156 --> 05:16.501
- What else?
- STEVIE: Hi.

05:16.525 --> 05:17.569
ELIZABETH and HENRY: Hey.

05:17.593 --> 05:19.237
Blake told me you guys were in here.

05:19.261 --> 05:20.839
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

05:20.863 --> 05:22.941
No, no, it's... (CHUCKLES)

05:22.965 --> 05:25.276
- You okay, sweetie?
- Yeah.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.444
- Yeah?
- Uh, yeah.

05:26.468 --> 05:28.780
I'm pretty great, actually.

05:28.804 --> 05:30.715
Sorry. With everything going on,
I know that's not really...

05:30.739 --> 05:32.050
Oh, come on.

05:32.074 --> 05:36.054
Listen, we could use
a little "pretty great."

05:36.078 --> 05:37.222
What do you got?

05:37.246 --> 05:41.092
Okay, um, so it was
kind of a bumpy start.

05:41.116 --> 05:44.963
But things with Dmitri
are, like, really wonderful.

05:44.987 --> 05:47.365
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) I'm not sure
if I've ever been happier.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.534
- You deserve it.
- Well, that's a nice piece...

05:49.558 --> 05:51.369
- Thanks.
- ...of pretty great right there.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.338
Yeah, we're, like, making plans...

05:53.362 --> 05:55.006
playfully... but, you know,

05:55.030 --> 05:57.509
what are we gonna be doing
in a few years, like, ten years,

05:57.533 --> 05:59.277
and where we want to live

05:59.301 --> 06:00.912
and how many kids and...

06:00.936 --> 06:02.386
Where and how many?

06:03.272 --> 06:04.382
- Keep going.
- Okay.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.885
But it's just that...

06:06.909 --> 06:08.987
we-we know that we
want to be together.

06:09.011 --> 06:10.989
It's just, I'm-I'm worried.

06:11.013 --> 06:13.124
I think he might be afraid to take it

06:13.148 --> 06:16.444
- to the next level, like, to propose.
- Oh.

06:16.468 --> 06:18.463
- Just, everything that happened,
like, in my testimony.

06:18.487 --> 06:20.031
I just feel like there's
a moment for these things,

06:20.055 --> 06:21.099
and I-I really, I don't want us

06:21.123 --> 06:23.635
to miss our moment. So,

06:23.659 --> 06:28.112
- I am gonna propose to him.
- (GASPS) Oh!

06:28.136 --> 06:29.607
- (LAUGHS)
- Oh, my God!

06:29.631 --> 06:30.942
- Is that crazy?
- Oh...

06:30.966 --> 06:32.944
- No, it's not crazy.
- Stevie. Oh, mwah.

06:32.968 --> 06:34.112
Look at where we are!

06:34.136 --> 06:36.214
- Yeah, girl power central here.
- Oh...

06:36.238 --> 06:38.116
But if it's gonna mess up your
lives... This is what I wanted

06:38.140 --> 06:39.484
to talk to you about.
I don't want to...

06:39.508 --> 06:41.953
Stevie, listen, don't
ever postpone your life

06:41.977 --> 06:44.889
- over political noise or anything else.
- Yeah. Hear, hear.

06:44.913 --> 06:47.258
- Got it.
- Now-now, c-come on. Tell us the details.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.760
Oh... Come on. Just...
How you gonna do it?

06:48.784 --> 06:50.295
- No, no. She's right.
- W-We won't... ask. You know.

06:50.319 --> 06:52.330
B-But how and when? But... yeah.

06:52.354 --> 06:53.932
BLAKE: Okay, you guys
are talking so loudly,

06:53.956 --> 06:55.200
and I... can I just hear
this part, please?

06:55.224 --> 06:56.534
- Yes. Okay.
- Okay.

06:56.558 --> 06:58.870
Um, so the day after tomorrow...

06:58.894 --> 07:01.139
Uh, you guys know that Chinese
restaurant, Hong Kong Garden?

07:01.163 --> 07:02.985
Oh, the one in Dupont Circle,
or the other one?

07:02.986 --> 07:03.833
Okay.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.877
Dupont, yeah. Um, so they
have, like, these, uh,

07:05.901 --> 07:07.745
personalized, um, fortune cookies.

07:07.769 --> 07:11.516
So I'm going to have them
plant the proposal

07:11.540 --> 07:12.984
- in the fortune cookie.
- (LAUGHTER)

07:13.008 --> 07:14.886
- That's genius.
- That's great.

07:14.910 --> 07:18.356
Just proofread it before
they stick it in the cookie.

07:18.380 --> 07:21.025
Yeah, good call there, <i>Elibet.</i>

07:21.049 --> 07:23.528
That's a reference to
a skywriting proposal.

07:23.552 --> 07:25.630
See, this is why they have assistants.

07:25.654 --> 07:28.399
Hey, why don't you, um,
bring Dmitri over here after

07:28.423 --> 07:30.668
and we can have a champagne toast?

07:30.692 --> 07:32.170
Yeah. I will.

07:32.194 --> 07:33.338
Thanks.

07:33.362 --> 07:34.439
- Aw.
- I'm so excited.

07:34.463 --> 07:36.074
(LAUGHTER)

07:36.098 --> 07:37.742
Oh, we're excited for you.

07:37.766 --> 07:39.477
- And grandkids.
- Just...

07:39.501 --> 07:41.145
HENRY: Just give her...
- She brought it up.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.014
Slow down, Mom.

07:43.038 --> 07:44.883
- Well, you're the one who brought it up.
- She's not even married yet.

07:44.907 --> 07:46.818
STEVIE: Good night.

07:46.842 --> 07:49.654
Speaking of up.
That's where I'm going.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.656
Come on. Go home, Blake.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.292
Okay. Uh, congratulation... um...

07:54.316 --> 07:57.495
Almost congratulations,
Dr. McCord, Madam President.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.364
(MOUTHS)

07:59.388 --> 08:01.165
(WHISPERS): Stevie's wedding.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.968
(WHISPERS): Lincoln Bedroom.

08:03.992 --> 08:05.069
- Let's go.
- Rawr.

08:05.093 --> 08:06.237
(BOTH LAUGH)

08:06.261 --> 08:07.572
RUSSELL: <i>Let's push</i>

08:07.596 --> 08:09.407
the DPC meeting.

08:09.431 --> 08:12.410
No point improving the
aqueducts while Rome burns.

08:12.434 --> 08:14.412
Ha! Good morning.

08:14.436 --> 08:16.648
- Hey.
- Rome burning again?

08:16.672 --> 08:18.816
I'm sorry, am... I late?

08:18.840 --> 08:21.085
Nope. No, I'm just...

08:21.109 --> 08:22.220
Carpe diem, you know?

08:22.244 --> 08:23.955
Which, as Henry pointed out,

08:23.979 --> 08:26.491
is part of a longer phrase.

08:26.515 --> 08:29.027
<i>Carpe diem, quam minimum</i>

08:29.051 --> 08:30.395
<i>credula postero.</i>

08:30.419 --> 08:31.896
It means,

08:31.920 --> 08:33.331
"Seize the day,

08:33.355 --> 08:35.198
put very little trust
in tomorrow," which...

08:35.222 --> 08:36.701
You can see how
that might speak to me.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.337
- I think it's beautiful.
- Right?

08:39.361 --> 08:42.674
So I made a to-do list for today.

08:42.698 --> 08:44.676
- (MUTTERS)
- Oh.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.878
- South China Sea.
- What about it?

08:46.902 --> 08:48.046
Fix it.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.615
After the dustup
between China and Russia,

08:50.639 --> 08:53.151
why not revisit
the Singapore Interchange?

08:53.175 --> 08:55.119
We can address all outstanding issues

08:55.143 --> 08:58.523

and stability to the region.

08:58.547 --> 09:00.558
- RUSSELL: Is that all?
- Ha! No.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.993
That is very... Do you really want

09:02.017 --> 09:04.095
to take on one of the most
intractable problems

09:04.119 --> 09:08.166
in the world while your head
is on the chopping block?

09:08.190 --> 09:10.868
Yep. Have Susan get into it
with Chen and Avdonin.

09:10.892 --> 09:13.871
And then I want to get serious
about carbon reduction.

09:13.895 --> 09:18.042
- Uh-huh.
- And expanding health care rolls.

09:18.066 --> 09:20.670
- Okay.
- And... ah, ugh... gun control.

09:20.694 --> 09:21.509
Mm-hmm.

09:21.510 --> 09:23.314
Why not just do world
peace while you're at it?

09:23.338 --> 09:26.084
That's the spirit.
What the hell? Write that down.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.485
World peace. Got it.

09:27.509 --> 09:28.720

...the free trade agreement
with South Korea.

It's true. So, I want to push forward

Dr. McCord, Dmitri Petrov is
a little early for your 3:00.

10:18.806 --> 10:20.784
Oh, uh, thanks. Great. Send him in.

10:20.808 --> 10:23.186
Right this way, Mr. Petrov.

10:23.210 --> 10:25.669
Hey, there he is. Wow, looking sharp.

10:25.670 --> 10:27.448
Hey. Thanks for making the time.

10:27.472 --> 10:28.716
Oh, of course. Any time.

10:28.740 --> 10:30.218
I've got a lot of ideas for you.

10:30.242 --> 10:32.286
Well, I hope you didn't
spend too much time

10:32.310 --> 10:33.621
thinking about my future prospects

10:33.645 --> 10:34.956
because that was a ruse.

10:34.980 --> 10:36.557
Really?

10:36.581 --> 10:38.133
Forgive me, I'm a little nervous.

10:38.134 --> 10:39.870
You know Stevie and I
have been back together

10:39.871 --> 10:40.915
- for a while now.
- I do.

10:40.939 --> 10:41.982
I think it's great.

10:42.006 --> 10:43.250
I'm very relieved to hear that.

10:43.274 --> 10:46.187
Because, with your permission...

10:46.211 --> 10:47.988
I want to ask Stephanie to marry me.

10:48.012 --> 10:49.290
Oh, my God!

10:49.314 --> 10:52.259
Wow, wow...

10:52.283 --> 10:53.961
Yes, yeah, uh, yes.

10:53.985 --> 10:56.764
But you don't have to ask me.

10:56.788 --> 10:58.599
Oh, I should ask the president, too?

10:58.623 --> 11:00.868
No, no, I just mean...
well, neither of us.

11:00.892 --> 11:03.204
Stevie's an adult, uh,

11:03.228 --> 11:05.061
but I appreciate the sentiment,

11:05.062 --> 11:06.072
given our past.

11:06.096 --> 11:07.240
Yeah, thanks.

11:07.264 --> 11:08.742
I wasn't sure with
the whole investigation

11:08.766 --> 11:12.412
if maybe you'd want me to wait
or just disappear altogether.

11:12.436 --> 11:14.781
Nonsense, life goes on
despite politics.

11:14.805 --> 11:18.284
Although I can't make
any guarantees about Stevie.

11:18.308 --> 11:19.352
Oh, of course not.

11:19.376 --> 11:20.587
That's on me.

11:20.611 --> 11:22.388
So, if you don't mind me asking,

11:22.412 --> 11:23.790
when were you gonna pop the question?

11:23.814 --> 11:25.425
Tomorrow night.

11:25.449 --> 11:26.793
Yeah, we're going out for
Chinese food, and then...

11:26.817 --> 11:28.294
Uh-huh... after that, I booked

11:28.318 --> 11:30.163
a private cruise on the Potomac.

11:30.187 --> 11:32.198
- So, after dinner?
- Yeah.

11:32.222 --> 11:33.566

11:51.284 --> 11:52.561

11:53.953 --> 11:55.564
Good, sounds like a good start.

11:55.588 --> 11:56.799
Yeah, what's next?

11:56.823 --> 11:59.001
I will have drafts by end
of the day of a bill

11:59.025 --> 12:01.703
to ban assault weapons
and an executive order

12:01.727 --> 12:03.739
directing NIH to research gun violence

12:03.763 --> 12:05.541
as a public health crisis.

12:05.565 --> 12:06.809

12:14.471 --> 12:16.349
who was jumped by a gang
of fifth-graders.

12:16.373 --> 12:18.150
Damn yinzer's a saint
like his father before him.

12:18.174 --> 12:20.052
- Wait, Heeney is from Pittsburg?
- Yeah.

12:20.076 --> 12:21.821
He and his dad have been
clinging to that seat

12:21.845 --> 12:23.689
so long, Pittsburgh's gonna
name a barnacle after them.

all about the Dmitri thing,

- (ALARM BEEPING)

12:41.498 --> 12:44.310
that Congressman Heeney
is from Pittsburgh?

12:44.334 --> 12:47.713
Yes, I-I-I knew his
old man a little bit

12:47.737 --> 12:48.748
when I was a kid.

12:48.772 --> 12:50.149
How did I not know that?

12:50.173 --> 12:51.517
I didn't know him that well.

12:51.541 --> 12:52.852
I certainly didn't know Junior.

12:52.876 --> 12:54.954
Back in the day, my dad
organized his chapter

12:54.978 --> 12:57.123
to phone bank and
door-knock for Heeney Sr.

12:57.147 --> 12:58.791
Well, how do you feel about exploiting

12:58.815 --> 13:00.426
that paternal connection

13:00.450 --> 13:04.363
to suss out Heeney Jr.'s
acquiescence to Canning?

13:04.387 --> 13:05.831
Thought you didn't
want to play politics.

13:05.855 --> 13:08.234
Well, I don't.

13:08.258 --> 13:10.703
But I also don't want to go
whistling to the guillotine.

13:10.727 --> 13:12.738
That's Mike's metaphor.

13:12.762 --> 13:15.074
Uh, listen, I'd be happy to
reach out to the congressman.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.675
We can reminisce about...
I don't know...

13:16.699 --> 13:19.412
our dads and when he
used to support you.

13:19.436 --> 13:20.679
Thank you.

13:20.703 --> 13:23.582
So, what about Dmitri's French farce?!

13:23.606 --> 13:25.818
So I completely forgot

13:25.842 --> 13:27.153
we had this meeting on the books.

13:27.177 --> 13:29.555
Is he really propose
tomorrow night, really?!

After the dinner

13:30.747 --> 13:32.558
when Stevie is proposing to him.

13:32.582 --> 13:34.593
He even mentioned going
out for Chinese food.

13:34.617 --> 13:36.162
Should we warn her?
I mean, just in case

13:36.186 --> 13:39.365
she wants to give him
a chance to propose first?

13:39.389 --> 13:42.334
And betray the confidence
of our future son-in-law

13:42.358 --> 13:43.436
before they're even engaged?

13:59.742 --> 14:01.720
It's not every day I get

14:01.744 --> 14:02.822
Ah, well, welcome.

14:02.846 --> 14:05.357
I still can't believe
that I live here.

14:05.381 --> 14:06.425
- Yeah.
- Please, have a seat.

14:06.449 --> 14:08.661
Thank you.

14:08.685 --> 14:10.729
Uh, your dad was a union
organizer, I believe.

14:10.753 --> 14:12.264
- I think you knew my old man?
- Yeah.

14:12.288 --> 14:16.202
In fact... I remember
your dad being at my house

14:16.226 --> 14:19.105
on more than a few rye-soaked
evenings and them getting

14:19.129 --> 14:22.541
into it over negotiations
with USW and steelmakers.

14:22.565 --> 14:24.710
Even when they agreed,
it sounded like fighting.

14:24.734 --> 14:26.278
(DEEP VOICE): Mm. "If you work hard,

14:26.302 --> 14:27.913

14:33.243 --> 14:35.354
- Yeah.
- Different time.

14:35.378 --> 14:36.722
But still in it.

14:36.746 --> 14:39.692
So, I understand your
camp was, uh, disappointed

14:39.716 --> 14:41.494
I didn't run interference for you

14:41.518 --> 14:42.995
and your daughter at the hearings.

14:43.019 --> 14:44.563
Well, we weren't looking for
interference... we were just

14:44.587 --> 14:45.998
hoping you would speak up
when Chairman Canning

14:46.022 --> 14:48.534
made unsubstantiated charges.

14:48.558 --> 14:50.102
Well, the committee has to
investigate before we can

14:50.126 --> 14:52.238
determine what was
unsubstantiated and what wasn't.

14:52.262 --> 14:53.405
I appreciate that.

14:53.429 --> 14:55.741
But Canning is making
baseless accusations

14:55.765 --> 14:58.577
through innuendo and conjecture.

14:58.601 --> 15:00.779
And trying to manipulate
public opinion

15:00.803 --> 15:04.083
to exact a political price
before the investigations

15:04.107 --> 15:06.919
turned anything up.
I-I was just surprised that

15:06.943 --> 15:09.622
someone with your background
would let that happen.

15:09.646 --> 15:11.023
I'm sorry you feel that way.

15:11.047 --> 15:13.225
But one yinzer to another,

15:13.249 --> 15:15.794
my dad also taught me
that political survival

15:15.818 --> 15:17.329
is about relevance.

15:17.353 --> 15:19.665
Sometimes it doesn't make any sense

15:19.689 --> 15:22.568
to throw yourself in front
of a train you can't stop.

15:22.592 --> 15:25.437
So, letting Canning
steamroll the administration

15:25.461 --> 15:28.374
and the truth is about
political expediency

15:28.398 --> 15:29.642
and self-preservation?

15:29.666 --> 15:31.610
I didn't come here for a lecture.

15:31.634 --> 15:34.480
Administrations come and they go.

15:34.504 --> 15:36.515

15:36.539 --> 15:38.117

15:40.176 --> 15:42.555
when the next
administration takes over.

15:42.579 --> 15:44.190
And the one after that.

15:44.214 --> 15:46.959
"He who ignores public injustice

15:46.983 --> 15:48.961

You can quote scripture all you want.

15:50.453 --> 15:51.964

17:40.539 --> 17:42.450
to disclose she was
in possession of evidence

17:42.474 --> 17:44.152
that Iran tampered with the election.

17:44.176 --> 17:46.554
To be accurate, Ms. Grant resigned.

17:46.578 --> 17:48.723
But you would have fired
her if she hadn't, correct?

17:48.747 --> 17:50.425
Yes, yes.

17:50.449 --> 17:52.427
Because you were looking
for a scapegoat for a decision

17:52.451 --> 17:53.995
that you knew
that you were responsible for.

17:54.019 --> 17:56.564
No, Mr. Chairman.

17:56.588 --> 18:00.201
Because Ms. Grant acted outside
the scope of her employment,

18:00.225 --> 18:02.437
without consulting me

18:02.461 --> 18:05.507
and in violation of her duties.

18:05.531 --> 18:07.175
Well, I think the evidence
to date has shown

18:07.199 --> 18:09.511
that your staff
was fiercely devoted to you.

18:09.535 --> 18:11.146
And they took no action
that they thought

18:11.170 --> 18:12.547
you would've disapproved of.

18:12.571 --> 18:14.649
Is there a question here,
Mr. Chairman?

18:14.673 --> 18:15.750
Yes, there is, Counselor.

18:15.774 --> 18:17.685
Madam President, are you telling

18:17.709 --> 18:19.287
this committee

18:19.311 --> 18:21.723
that Ms. Grant was a rogue actor?

18:21.747 --> 18:23.258
- Yes.
- Who wasn't even acting

18:23.282 --> 18:24.893
at your implied direction?

18:24.917 --> 18:27.962
Asked and answered.
Let's move on, Mr. Chairman.

18:27.986 --> 18:29.798
Then I'll cut to the chase.

18:29.822 --> 18:32.233
For the record, did you act
in concert with any member

18:32.257 --> 18:33.902
of the Iranian government
to undermine your opponent

18:33.926 --> 18:35.870
in the presidential election?

18:35.894 --> 18:36.938
No, I did not.

18:36.962 --> 18:38.273
Did you have any knowledge that Iran

18:38.297 --> 18:39.774
was interfering on your behalf

18:39.798 --> 18:41.376
during the presidential campaign?

18:41.400 --> 18:43.478
No, I did not.

18:43.502 --> 18:45.080
You are aware that your answers today

18:45.104 --> 18:46.214
are under penalty of perjury?

18:46.238 --> 18:48.616
Yes, Mr. Chairman, I am.

18:48.640 --> 18:52.120
And your implication
notwithstanding, I...

18:52.144 --> 18:53.755
I believe I have demonstrated

18:53.779 --> 18:57.292
how seriously I take
these proceedings.

18:57.316 --> 18:58.927
Why don't we test that
proposition by turning

18:58.951 --> 19:01.563
to your many contacts with
Iranian Foreign Minister Tousi

19:01.587 --> 19:03.298
during the election year.

19:03.322 --> 19:04.599
You were exceptionally close

19:04.623 --> 19:06.601
to the foreign minister, weren't you?

19:06.625 --> 19:08.069
We have a situation.

19:08.093 --> 19:11.139
One of our destroyers was fired
on by a Chinese patrol boat

19:11.163 --> 19:13.314
in the South China Sea.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.910
Casualties?

19:15.934 --> 19:17.979
24 American sailors killed.

19:18.003 --> 19:19.814
We engaged the Chinese vessel.

19:19.838 --> 19:21.349
Sank it.

19:21.373 --> 19:23.457
We're expecting
hundreds of casualties.

19:27.479 --> 19:29.257
- Mr. Chairman, I'm very sorry.
- Mr. Chairman,

19:29.281 --> 19:30.725
due to pressing matters
of state, the president

19:30.749 --> 19:32.093
must adjourn
her testimony at this time.

19:32.117 --> 19:33.361
(GAVEL BANGING)

19:33.385 --> 19:35.096
We object to this
choreographed interruption!

19:35.120 --> 19:36.304
Madam President?

19:37.389 --> 19:40.668
Madam President, this is
an insult to this committee!

19:40.692 --> 19:41.936
What the hell is going on?

19:41.960 --> 19:45.006
The Arleigh Burke class
destroyer <i>Edwin James</i>

19:45.030 --> 19:48.476
was three miles outside
the coast of Hainan Dao

19:48.500 --> 19:49.811
when it came under attack

19:49.835 --> 19:53.181
from two Chinese
Type 22 missile boats.

19:53.205 --> 19:54.849
Unprovoked?

19:54.873 --> 19:55.984
Yes, ma'am.

19:56.008 --> 19:59.220
I recommend going
to worldwide DEFCON 4

19:59.244 --> 20:02.624
and DEFCON 3 in INDOPACOM AOR.

20:02.648 --> 20:04.626
Do it.

20:04.650 --> 20:06.995
What the hell is
President Li thinking?

20:07.019 --> 20:08.263
General Hayes, where are we?

20:08.287 --> 20:10.298
Madam President, we're sending

20:10.322 --> 20:12.567
Carrier Strike Team 5
to assist the <i>James</i>

20:12.591 --> 20:15.537
and deter any further
incursions by hostiles.

20:15.561 --> 20:17.539
(QUIETLY): All right.

20:17.563 --> 20:19.140
Admiral Fanning,
I want to speak to the captain.

20:19.164 --> 20:22.544
Captain Woodcliff was KIA, ma'am.

20:22.568 --> 20:24.479
Executive Officer Harris in command.

20:24.503 --> 20:26.047
Let's get him on screen.

20:26.071 --> 20:28.183
Harris here.

20:28.207 --> 20:30.985
Commander Harris,
this is the president.

20:31.009 --> 20:33.655
I need you to describe
for me what happened.

20:33.679 --> 20:35.390
It was a routine flyby, ma'am.

20:35.414 --> 20:38.126
We were in egress when they lit us up.

20:38.150 --> 20:39.360
Was there any kind of warning?

20:39.384 --> 20:41.496
None. Phalanx CIWS

20:41.520 --> 20:44.165
shot down most
of their missiles, but one

20:44.189 --> 20:45.700
made a direct hit on the bridge.

20:45.724 --> 20:46.901
- Damage control reports...
- (GARBLED TRANSMISSION)

20:46.925 --> 20:48.269
FANNING: Commander Harris?

20:48.293 --> 20:49.771
- (GARBLED TRANSMISSION)
- HARRIS: ...our best to triage.

20:49.795 --> 20:51.105
FANNING: Commander Harris,
can you proceed

20:51.129 --> 20:52.207
to the fallback point?

20:52.231 --> 20:54.509
HARRIS: Negative.

20:54.533 --> 20:57.512
Chief engineer reports
total engine failure.

20:57.536 --> 20:58.846
We're sitting ducks.

20:58.870 --> 21:00.848
You sit tight, Commander.

21:00.872 --> 21:01.983
Help is on the way.

21:02.007 --> 21:03.251
HARRIS: Thank you, ma'am.

21:03.275 --> 21:05.053
HAYES: This is a list
of military targets

21:05.077 --> 21:07.388
on Hainan Dao.

21:07.412 --> 21:08.690
Codeword: Dragonfly.

21:08.714 --> 21:10.725
FANNING: Madam President,
we have an Ohio-class sub

21:10.749 --> 21:14.062
armed with conventional
warheads standing by.

21:14.086 --> 21:15.697
You want to retaliate.

21:15.721 --> 21:18.066
HILL: If we don't, we'll be
sending a message of weakness,

21:18.090 --> 21:21.102
giving the Chinese
carte blanche to escalate.

21:21.126 --> 21:24.772
Uh, and we've already killed
hundreds of their sailors.

21:24.796 --> 21:27.642
- That was self-defense.
- Yes, but to the Chinese,

21:27.666 --> 21:32.247
any further aggression
will be seen as gratuitous.

21:32.271 --> 21:35.717
They'll attack the Fifth Fleet next.

21:35.741 --> 21:37.118
Our war games make

21:37.142 --> 21:38.786
- no such assumption, ma'am.
- RUSSELL: How many deals

21:38.810 --> 21:41.256
have you negotiated
with the Chinese, General?

21:41.280 --> 21:43.091
I need to speak with President Li.

21:43.115 --> 21:45.660
Due respect, ma'am,
actions speak louder.

21:45.684 --> 21:48.796
I will not risk war
without a dialogue.

21:48.820 --> 21:51.599
This is a rescue mission
until I say otherwise.

21:51.623 --> 21:54.110
- Are w... are we clear?
- Yes, ma'am.

21:54.111 --> 21:55.366
- Understood.
- Thank you.

21:57.690 --> 22:01.355
You invaded Chinese territory.
There is nothing more to say.

22:01.356 --> 22:05.369
President Li, we both know
accidents can happen.

22:05.393 --> 22:09.140
I'm offering you a chance
to walk this back.

22:09.164 --> 22:11.614
This was no accident.
Well, then, your attack

22:11.615 --> 22:13.593
was reckless and unprovoked.

22:13.617 --> 22:15.295
These flybys are routine.

22:15.319 --> 22:18.465
There's nothing routine
about defending our sovereignty.

22:18.489 --> 22:20.467
It is our island.

22:20.491 --> 22:23.636
You want to litigate that point,
let's do it in Singapore.

22:23.660 --> 22:25.305
At a renewed diplomatic interchange.

22:25.329 --> 22:29.215
We no longer recognize
that interchange.

22:30.100 --> 22:33.279
Apologize and withdraw your forces.

22:33.303 --> 22:35.482
I won't engage in ultimatums.

22:35.506 --> 22:37.484
Those are my terms.

22:37.508 --> 22:41.494
The rest is up to you,
Madam President.

22:45.883 --> 22:48.328
Can we expect support from our allies?

22:48.352 --> 22:50.830
In public, yes. In private,
I'm hearing concerns.

22:50.854 --> 22:53.867
Yeah, and in the meantime,
world markets are in free fall.

22:53.891 --> 22:55.401
Supermarkets are being overrun

22:55.425 --> 22:57.403
by people hoarding basic supplies

22:57.427 --> 23:00.373
and the top search on Google
is "nuclear war."

23:00.397 --> 23:04.677
It might be time to consider
an Oval Office address, ma'am.

23:04.701 --> 23:07.146
Well, and say what? If we want
to allay people's concern,

23:07.170 --> 23:09.015
we have to get our sailors

23:09.039 --> 23:10.938
- and the <i>James</i> out of there...
- HILL: Madam President,

23:10.939 --> 23:13.375
SIGINT confirms the PLA has gone

23:13.376 --> 23:15.955
to combat readiness condition level 2.

23:15.979 --> 23:17.123
HAYES: Dongfeng 5

23:17.147 --> 23:18.892
ICBMs are moving to launchpads.

23:18.916 --> 23:21.895
They'll be capable of
nuclear first strike

23:21.919 --> 23:24.130
within a few hours.

23:24.154 --> 23:26.366
That's absurd.
HILL: And yet, it's happening.

23:26.390 --> 23:27.534
Ma'am,

23:27.558 --> 23:28.968
- we must respond.
- RUSSELL: I agree.

23:28.992 --> 23:31.170
If this is how Li

23:31.194 --> 23:33.172
is choosing to communicate,

23:33.196 --> 23:35.208
we have to answer with strength.

23:35.232 --> 23:37.410
Go to DEFCON 2.

23:37.434 --> 23:40.079
Have all essential personnel
recalled to safe locations.

23:40.103 --> 23:42.415
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, Madam President.

23:42.439 --> 23:48.087
Okay. I... We need to track
President Li's logic here.

23:48.111 --> 23:50.390
It's a calculated flex.

23:50.414 --> 23:53.560
Probably because he believes
that I'm hamstrung

23:53.584 --> 23:55.094
by the impeachment hearing, right?

23:55.118 --> 23:57.497
THOMPSON: Li thinks
you're too weak to risk

23:57.521 --> 23:59.432
taking a divided nation to war.

23:59.456 --> 24:00.709
We just went to DEFCON 2,

24:00.710 --> 24:02.855
so that ought to make him think twice.

24:02.879 --> 24:05.191
But Susan's right.

24:05.215 --> 24:08.294
We need to send a message of unity.

24:08.318 --> 24:09.795
How? I'll ask Congress

24:09.819 --> 24:12.298
for Authorization for
the Use of Military Force.

24:12.322 --> 24:15.834
An AUMF?
In the middle of an impeachment?

24:15.858 --> 24:18.804
Especially in the middle
of an impeachment.

24:18.828 --> 24:21.974
I have to trust that Congress
will do the right thing.

24:21.998 --> 24:24.149
All right.

24:26.035 --> 24:27.379
I'll reach out to leadership.

24:27.403 --> 24:30.549
Susan, tell Minister Chen
I want to talk to him.

24:30.573 --> 24:32.585
I know it bypasses protocol,
but I need a conversation

24:32.609 --> 24:34.420
with a friend over there.

24:34.444 --> 24:37.502
THOMPSON: I'll see what I can do.

24:37.503 --> 24:40.666
NEWS ANCHOR: <i>President McCord
has just declared DEFCON 2,</i>

24:40.667 --> 24:43.713
meaning all U.S. military
around the world

24:43.737 --> 24:45.381
stand at hair-trigger readiness.

24:45.405 --> 24:47.851
Supermarkets across the nation
are reportedly preparing

24:47.875 --> 24:49.719
for a rush of panicked consumers...

24:49.743 --> 24:51.154
Man.

24:51.178 --> 24:53.857
Maybe not the best night to be
eating at a Chinese restaurant.

24:53.881 --> 24:56.080
- Well, at least it's pretty empty.
- Yeah,

24:56.081 --> 24:59.026
probably because everyone's
already in bomb shelters.

24:59.611 --> 25:01.255
Hey, maybe we should go.

25:01.256 --> 25:03.334
Oh, wh... we can wait for the check.

25:03.358 --> 25:04.702
Ah. This will cover it.

25:04.726 --> 25:08.105
Well, hang on. What about
our fortune cookies?

25:08.129 --> 25:10.040
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)
You hate fortune cookies.

25:10.064 --> 25:13.210
Well, maybe tonight I am feeling
a little bit superstitious.

25:13.234 --> 25:15.246
- No change. Thanks.
- What...

25:15.270 --> 25:17.114
What's, um... wait.

25:17.138 --> 25:18.882
Wh... uh, hang on.
What's-what's the rush?

25:18.906 --> 25:20.551
Come on. L-Let's read our fortunes.

25:20.575 --> 25:22.419
Excuse me. We have a security alert.

25:22.443 --> 25:24.421
We need to get you to the
White House immediately.

25:24.445 --> 25:26.390
...and fired upon the <i>Edwin James</i>

25:26.414 --> 25:27.558
when it passed within miles...

25:27.582 --> 25:28.859
Geez... I'm coming, I'm coming.

25:28.883 --> 25:31.034
Just...

25:35.723 --> 25:39.370
HAYES: Rescue operations have
proceeded without interference.

25:39.394 --> 25:41.372
We've recovered our sailors

25:41.396 --> 25:43.774
and towed the <i>Edwin James</i> out of area.

25:43.798 --> 25:45.476
But now the real threat is here.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.411
Admiral?

25:47.435 --> 25:49.280
FANNING: A Chinese support
fleet has just assembled

25:49.304 --> 25:51.682
about 200 klicks west of Luzon.

25:51.706 --> 25:54.652
It includes six Type 072 landing craft

25:54.676 --> 25:58.722
with a deck cargo of DF-21D
anti-ship ballistic missiles.

25:58.746 --> 26:00.591
They call it the carrier killer.

26:00.615 --> 26:03.260
ETA to Hainan Dao is 12 hours.

26:03.284 --> 26:04.328
(SIGHS)

26:04.352 --> 26:05.663
Now, if those missiles reach land...

26:05.687 --> 26:07.464
HILL: It could neutralize

26:07.488 --> 26:11.235
our operative capabilities in
the South China Sea for decades.

26:11.259 --> 26:13.671
Clearly, this was the
endgame all along.

26:13.695 --> 26:17.775
To use the dustup with the
<i>James</i> as a manufactured pretext

26:17.799 --> 26:20.177
to seize the regional advantage.

26:20.201 --> 26:21.345
Freedom of navigation

26:21.369 --> 26:23.504
is a bedrock principle,
Madam President.

26:23.505 --> 26:26.283
Nothing short of our liberty
is at stake here.

26:26.307 --> 26:29.620
It's also a blatant violation
of the Singapore Interchange.

26:29.644 --> 26:31.955
- We could go to the U.N.
- (RUSSELL SCOFFS)

26:31.979 --> 26:33.624
Where China has a veto.

26:33.648 --> 26:36.527
Or we can strike now.

26:36.551 --> 26:37.861
HILL: He's right, ma'am.

26:37.885 --> 26:40.464
The alternative is a complete retreat.

26:40.488 --> 26:42.333
What do you suggest?

26:42.357 --> 26:45.936
An immediate launch of our F-35s
on the USS <i>Saratoga.</i>

26:45.960 --> 26:47.838
The remainder of the Fifth Fleet

26:47.862 --> 26:50.207
will launch Tomahawks against
the targets on Hainan Dao

26:50.231 --> 26:53.477
under Operation Dragonfly.

26:53.501 --> 26:57.114
With China's nuclear forces
and ours on high alert?

26:57.138 --> 27:00.117
This could trigger a-a carnage
that we can't stop.

27:00.141 --> 27:03.454
HILL: We have the superior
capability here, ma'am.

27:03.478 --> 27:04.888
Let's use it

27:04.912 --> 27:06.957
to shove them back and retain

27:06.981 --> 27:08.792
our strategic advantage

27:08.816 --> 27:10.461
in the South China Sea.

27:10.485 --> 27:12.196
Well, I agree

27:12.220 --> 27:15.132
we can't let those missiles
reach the island.

27:15.156 --> 27:18.435
But I am not prepared
to start a shooting war

27:18.459 --> 27:20.537
that could end with the unthinkable.

27:20.561 --> 27:22.039
I want

27:22.063 --> 27:24.180
other options.

27:25.900 --> 27:29.119
What about a blockade?

27:30.938 --> 27:33.684
Declare an exclusion
zone around the island,

27:33.708 --> 27:36.019
block any attempt to breach it?

27:36.043 --> 27:38.389
Is that possible?

27:38.413 --> 27:40.491
Well, in theory.

27:40.515 --> 27:42.559
It worked for Kennedy.
Why the hell not?

27:42.583 --> 27:45.329
Because it would put
us on the defensive.

27:45.353 --> 27:47.431
And hands them the initiative.

27:47.455 --> 27:50.701
If it leads to a peaceful
resolution, they can have it.

27:50.725 --> 27:52.703
Admiral,
establish the quarantine line.

27:52.727 --> 27:53.937
Yes, ma'am.

27:53.961 --> 27:55.839
Susan, will you get
to the Chinese Embassy?

27:55.863 --> 27:58.041
I want this ultimatum
delivered in person.

27:58.065 --> 27:59.777
Absolutely, Madam President.

27:59.801 --> 28:01.745
RUSSELL: <i>I'll let you know</i>

28:01.769 --> 28:03.480
if we get a response from Beijing.

28:03.504 --> 28:04.648
The moment.

28:04.672 --> 28:06.450
Yeah. Meantime, it's a waiting game.

28:06.474 --> 28:08.318
Whoa!

28:08.342 --> 28:10.220
You have your AUMF.

28:10.244 --> 28:12.623
Congress just passed it
in emergency session.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.792
All right, well, let's
make some noise about it.

28:14.816 --> 28:17.428
Oh, I'll make sure it's
clanging in President Li's ear.

28:17.452 --> 28:19.069
Great.

28:21.088 --> 28:22.065
<i>Well, hey.</i>

28:22.089 --> 28:23.667
- Hey.
- What-what are you doing?

28:23.691 --> 28:25.469
Well, I thought we
needed some champagne.

28:25.493 --> 28:27.604
Oh. Yeah.

28:27.628 --> 28:30.140
Sure. You know, champagne.

28:30.164 --> 28:33.076
Just what you want when
you're about an inch away

28:33.100 --> 28:34.978
from war with a nuclear adversary.

28:35.002 --> 28:36.547
- What? It's not...
- Of course,

28:36.571 --> 28:38.749
there's always the impeachment
I'm trying to stave off,

28:38.773 --> 28:41.385
which is probably a
foregone conclusion

28:41.409 --> 28:43.587
after I ditched my testimony.

28:43.611 --> 28:45.489
- Babe, uh...
- Oh, you're right.

28:45.513 --> 28:47.024
(WHISPERS): Just pop it.

28:47.048 --> 28:49.393
It's not just for us. Dmitri

28:49.417 --> 28:51.094
and Stevie are on their way up.

28:51.118 --> 28:53.430
I don't have time. I'm so tired!

28:53.454 --> 28:55.766
(GASPS)

28:55.790 --> 28:56.934
Oh, my gosh.

28:56.958 --> 28:58.869
Yes! What happened?

28:58.893 --> 29:01.605
Well, so, security protocols
forced them

29:01.629 --> 29:03.207
to cut their date short

29:03.231 --> 29:05.776
and, uh, skip
their Potomac cruise, but...

29:05.800 --> 29:07.444
Oh, cruise-schmooze.
What happened at the dinner?

29:07.468 --> 29:10.180
Okay, all I know is their detail said

29:10.204 --> 29:12.483
that they finished dinner,
which means that...

29:12.507 --> 29:14.251
Our little girl!

29:14.275 --> 29:15.752
- Oh, here they are!
- The happy couple!

29:15.776 --> 29:17.221
There you are!

29:17.245 --> 29:18.622
- Oh, come on.
- Oh. Oh. Hey.

29:18.646 --> 29:19.823
- Hi.
- Hey.

29:19.847 --> 29:21.792
ELIZABETH: Ah.
- We did not have dessert.

29:21.816 --> 29:23.160
ELIZABETH: Oh.

29:23.184 --> 29:25.062
- That's... too bad.
- Yeah.

29:25.086 --> 29:26.888
Dessert is a cornerstone
of any meal, so...

29:26.912 --> 29:27.782
Yeah.

29:27.783 --> 29:30.467
Yes, and we had to come straight
here from the restaurant.

29:30.491 --> 29:32.970
Well, oh, we-we... we just thought

29:32.994 --> 29:35.105
that you'd want to have
some champagne with us.

29:35.129 --> 29:36.507
There's water for you.

29:36.531 --> 29:39.176
Yeah. While we still can.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.477
Yeah. Yeah, right.
That's lovely of you.

29:40.501 --> 29:41.645
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

29:41.669 --> 29:43.280
- Thank you.
- Sure. Thanks, guys.

29:43.304 --> 29:46.316
Honey. Yeah, well, here's to...

29:46.340 --> 29:48.785
Nothing.

29:48.809 --> 29:50.454
(LAUGHTER)

29:50.478 --> 29:53.023
No. Stop.

29:53.047 --> 29:55.092
Sorry. This is silly.

29:55.116 --> 29:57.561
This was meant to be an occasion.

29:57.585 --> 29:59.129
A big occasion.

29:59.153 --> 30:00.564
Henry, you didn't tell...

30:00.588 --> 30:03.100
On my honor. Stevie doesn't
know anything about it.

30:03.124 --> 30:04.568
- STEVIE: Wait. He knows? You...
- What?

30:04.592 --> 30:06.136
- You told him?
- ELIZABETH: No.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.538
We didn't say anything.

30:07.562 --> 30:08.872
- Never.
- I don't understand.

30:08.896 --> 30:10.107
Let's just... everybody go home,

30:10.131 --> 30:11.875
- because that's...
- Yeah. Uh, just...

30:11.899 --> 30:13.343
Let's just pretend
like it never happened.

30:13.367 --> 30:17.214
Wait. I was going to do this, um...

30:17.238 --> 30:19.049
I'm gonna do it.

30:19.073 --> 30:21.752
Dmitri... this is for you.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.854
Uh...

30:23.878 --> 30:26.490
It's the-the fortune inside.

30:26.514 --> 30:27.824
- If you read it. Just...
- Oh.

30:27.848 --> 30:29.566
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

30:32.920 --> 30:35.499
Oh. Wow. This is...

30:35.523 --> 30:37.200
What does it say? "The early bird

30:37.224 --> 30:40.337
gets the worm, but the second
mouse gets the cheese."

30:40.361 --> 30:42.306
Wait. What?

30:42.330 --> 30:43.840
They mixed up the cookies.

30:43.864 --> 30:45.909
- It's very true, though.
- Oh.

30:45.933 --> 30:47.911
STEVIE: This was supposed to be

30:47.935 --> 30:50.080
a message from me.

30:50.104 --> 30:52.549
Um, a question, actually.

30:52.573 --> 30:54.351
I wanted to ask you to...

30:54.375 --> 30:56.753
Stop. Please. Let me.

30:56.777 --> 30:59.189
Here.

30:59.213 --> 31:00.557
In front of your parents,

31:00.581 --> 31:02.225
even though it was
supposed to be alone

31:02.249 --> 31:04.261
on a boat. (LAUGHS) But

31:04.285 --> 31:06.263
there might be a nuclear war,
and... Sorry, no offense,

31:06.287 --> 31:08.098
- Madam President.
- No problem. Go on.

31:08.122 --> 31:10.534
I don't know how to begin.
(LAUGHS) No. I do know

31:10.558 --> 31:12.936
how to begin with you,
Stevie, because you...

31:12.960 --> 31:14.972
you are my beginning, and the start

31:14.996 --> 31:16.873
of everything that matters to me.

31:16.897 --> 31:19.409
My happiness and hope for the future.

31:19.433 --> 31:21.044
I've been broken many times,

31:21.068 --> 31:23.447
and it's hard for me
to feel whole, but

31:23.471 --> 31:25.382
there's one time I do feel whole.

31:25.406 --> 31:27.951
When you are with me.
And if you let me,

31:27.975 --> 31:31.088
I will dedicate my life
to making you feel whole, too.

31:31.112 --> 31:33.357
Because... because I love you more

31:33.381 --> 31:34.992
than I ever knew I could love.

31:35.016 --> 31:36.966
(LAUGHS)

31:37.852 --> 31:39.196
Stephanie McCord will you...

31:39.220 --> 31:41.832
Madam President, we need... you.

31:41.856 --> 31:43.333
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sor...

31:43.357 --> 31:45.469
Oh, my God. Is-is he actually...?

31:45.493 --> 31:48.739
Dmitri, as president,
I order you to finish

31:48.763 --> 31:50.273
- that sentence!
- Stevie, will you marry me?

31:50.297 --> 31:51.708
Yes, yes, for God's sake.

31:51.732 --> 31:53.010
- HENRY: Ah.
- (LAUGHTER)

31:53.034 --> 31:55.045
Yay. Welcome to the family.

31:55.069 --> 31:56.913
I have to go. I don't know
when I'm coming back.

31:56.937 --> 31:58.248
- Bye, Mom!
- Uh, just-just go.

31:58.272 --> 32:00.217
Ellen, what is it?

32:00.241 --> 32:02.753
It seems we have President Li's
answer to the blockade.

32:02.777 --> 32:04.187
Several high-speed

32:04.211 --> 32:06.623
Type 22 Chinese missile boats
have broken away

32:06.647 --> 32:08.759
from the convoy headed to Hainan Dao

32:08.783 --> 32:12.129
and now are projected
to reach the quarantine line

32:12.153 --> 32:14.504
in just four hours.

32:15.389 --> 32:17.768
Okay. Fire up Marine One.

32:17.792 --> 32:19.302
Where are you going?

32:19.326 --> 32:21.371
New York to see Minister Chen.

32:21.395 --> 32:22.472
Well, he wouldn't take your calls.

32:22.496 --> 32:23.807
Why do you think he'll meet with you?

32:23.831 --> 32:26.983
Because he knows where
this is heading if he doesn't.

32:38.346 --> 32:40.224
Excuse me, Minister Chen?

32:40.248 --> 32:42.399
Yes. What is it?

32:47.188 --> 32:49.133
- Ming, you got a minute?
- Ambushed

32:49.157 --> 32:51.035
by the American president.

32:51.059 --> 32:53.237
Definitely one for the memoir.

32:53.261 --> 32:56.207
I look forward to reading it one day.

32:56.231 --> 32:58.242
In a future where we manage

32:58.266 --> 33:01.112
to find a way out of this crisis.

33:01.136 --> 33:03.114
Your naval blockade isn't helping.

33:03.138 --> 33:05.483
China attacked us,

33:05.507 --> 33:08.319
murdering 24 U.S. sailors.

33:08.343 --> 33:10.354
Don't.

33:10.378 --> 33:12.529
(SIGHS)

33:14.482 --> 33:16.460
I mean, for the sake of the world,

33:16.484 --> 33:18.462
I hope you can help me understand

33:18.486 --> 33:20.798
what the hell Li is doing.

33:20.822 --> 33:23.668
Li didn't approve firing on your ship.

33:23.692 --> 33:25.870
It was a rogue commander

33:25.894 --> 33:29.340
who thinks the party has lost its way.

33:29.364 --> 33:32.310
(LAUGHS) Well...

33:32.334 --> 33:33.911
That's good.

33:33.935 --> 33:37.181
That means that Li doesn't
want this confrontation

33:37.205 --> 33:38.516
any more than I do.

33:38.540 --> 33:41.953
But he can't admit
his military acted alone.

33:41.977 --> 33:44.155
He needs to preserve his honor.

33:44.179 --> 33:46.290
The fact that you're a woman...

33:46.314 --> 33:48.326
- For Pete's sake.
- I'm just saying,

33:48.350 --> 33:50.695
- it's a factor.
- Would he rather blow up the world

33:50.719 --> 33:52.697
than back down to a girl?

33:52.721 --> 33:55.599
President Li is a... proud man.

33:55.623 --> 33:57.702
Too bad.

33:57.726 --> 33:59.403
No.

33:59.427 --> 34:03.040
I am not allowing the
militarization of Hainan Dao.

34:03.064 --> 34:05.276
Then there's no way out.

34:05.300 --> 34:07.451
(SIGHS, SNIFFLES)

34:10.705 --> 34:13.016
If this is really about President Li's

34:13.041 --> 34:15.192
pride and honor...

34:16.411 --> 34:19.456
...then what if we move our
ships away from the island

34:19.481 --> 34:20.958
before your ships get there?

34:20.982 --> 34:22.994
So you will back down?

34:23.018 --> 34:25.529
No.

34:25.553 --> 34:28.532
Even from hundreds of miles away,

34:28.556 --> 34:31.369
we can still strike
the quarantine line.

34:31.393 --> 34:34.538
And we will do that if
your vessels cross it.

34:34.562 --> 34:38.641
But Li can claim
the United States blinked first.

34:38.666 --> 34:41.379
Yes, and then quietly order his ships

34:41.402 --> 34:43.554
to steer away from Hainan Dao.

34:48.342 --> 34:50.321
As a friend,

34:50.344 --> 34:55.059
I want to share that
Stevie got engaged tonight.

34:55.083 --> 34:57.495
Congratulations.

34:57.519 --> 34:59.630
- Elizabeth.
- I know.

34:59.654 --> 35:03.740
There's no greater joy
than expanding one's family.

35:04.626 --> 35:06.777
Thank you.

35:08.630 --> 35:10.781
I wish the same for you.

35:15.003 --> 35:17.014
That was manipulative,

35:17.038 --> 35:19.323
but highly effective.

35:21.042 --> 35:23.193
The truth often is.

35:24.446 --> 35:26.997
I will take your proposal
to President Li.

35:30.885 --> 35:32.863
RADAR OFFICER: <i>Contact</i>

35:32.887 --> 35:34.265

35:36.291 --> 35:40.838

No alteration in course, ma'am.

35:42.564 --> 35:43.774

FANNING: They're gonna blow
through the quarantine line,

35:47.202 --> 35:48.245
Madam President.

35:48.269 --> 35:49.380
You have your orders.

35:49.404 --> 35:50.481
FANNING: Light 'em up, Captain.

35:50.505 --> 35:52.049
CAPTAIN: Roger that.

35:52.073 --> 35:53.284

35:53.308 --> 35:54.685
Prepare to execute on my command.

35:56.077 --> 35:58.222
RADAR OFFICER:

Now steering course 350.

35:59.514 --> 36:00.891

36:04.018 --> 36:07.031
They're turning around.

36:07.055 --> 36:08.699
- Lord in heaven, they're turning.
- ELIZABETH: Ooh.

36:08.723 --> 36:10.701
- (APPLAUSE)
- Son of a bitch.

36:10.725 --> 36:13.176
Congratulations, Madam President.

36:17.031 --> 36:18.976
CANNING: <i>Madam President,</i>

36:19.000 --> 36:21.779
we were discussing your contacts
with Foreign Minister Tousi.

36:21.803 --> 36:23.747
ELIZABETH:
Yes, I recall, Mr. Chairman.

36:23.771 --> 36:26.817
Then you must also recall
that, uh, you left intentionally

36:26.841 --> 36:28.652
before I could inquire
about the matter.

36:28.676 --> 36:30.221
I left because

36:30.245 --> 36:33.157
there was an
international incident that...

36:33.181 --> 36:35.759
required my immediate attention.

36:35.783 --> 36:38.295
Yes. An armed conflict
with China that resulted

36:38.319 --> 36:40.364
in two dozen American fatalities.

36:40.388 --> 36:42.500
Tragically, yes. But you deftly

36:42.524 --> 36:44.935
navigated your way
around a potential war,

36:44.959 --> 36:46.103
didn't you?

36:46.127 --> 36:47.671
Mr. Chairman, is there
an actual question here?

36:47.695 --> 36:48.873
Yes, there is. Isn't it true

36:48.897 --> 36:50.841
that the conflict with China,

36:50.865 --> 36:54.278
and its magical resolution,
was entirely fabricated

36:54.302 --> 36:56.180
by your administration to distract

36:56.204 --> 36:57.615
from these impeachment proceedings?

36:57.639 --> 37:00.284
- (GALLERY CLAMORING)
- (BANGS GAVEL)

37:00.308 --> 37:01.785
I'll have order in this room.

37:01.809 --> 37:04.855
Madam President,
there is a question outstanding.

37:04.879 --> 37:06.490
It isn't a question.

37:06.514 --> 37:08.392
It's an accusation.

37:08.416 --> 37:10.794
And I will not support your attempt

37:10.818 --> 37:13.063
to politicize the sacrifice

37:13.087 --> 37:15.032
of two dozen sailors who died

37:15.056 --> 37:17.067
protecting our country.

37:17.091 --> 37:19.837
I will then, uh, repeat
the question one more time.

37:19.861 --> 37:21.105
ELIZABETH: But I'm...

37:21.129 --> 37:22.273
not going to answer it.

37:22.297 --> 37:24.408
But if you refuse
to respond, you do leave

37:24.432 --> 37:26.911
this committee with no choice
but to hold you in contempt.

37:26.935 --> 37:28.479
This committee will do no such thing.

37:28.503 --> 37:29.713
CANNING: Excuse me?

37:29.737 --> 37:30.981
HEENEY: Mr. Chairman?

37:31.005 --> 37:34.051
- You're out of order, Congressman.
- Mr. Chairman!

37:34.075 --> 37:36.921
Since the inception of these
hearings, you have used

37:36.945 --> 37:39.390
your pulpit to grandstand and peacock

37:39.414 --> 37:41.425
in front of these cameras
at the expense

37:41.449 --> 37:43.961
of the American taxpayer with nothing

37:43.985 --> 37:47.231
to offer...

37:47.255 --> 37:49.867
but imaginary conspiracy theories

37:49.891 --> 37:52.169
and false narratives
about the president's

37:52.193 --> 37:54.004
secret alliances with Iran,

37:54.028 --> 37:55.472
and now China,

37:55.496 --> 37:56.941
and her alleged corruption.

37:56.965 --> 37:58.642
You will stand down, Congressman.

37:58.666 --> 38:00.945
I have yielded my time
to you over and over again.

38:00.969 --> 38:04.148
Out of fundamental fairness,

38:04.172 --> 38:06.984
you can yield a few moments to me now.

38:07.008 --> 38:08.986
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)

38:09.010 --> 38:11.728
The Chair recognizes
the gentleman from Pennsylvania.

38:14.148 --> 38:16.427
HEENEY: For the past two months...

38:16.451 --> 38:19.096
two months... this committee

38:19.120 --> 38:21.799
and the Senate Intelligence
Committee before it

38:21.823 --> 38:25.102
has pursued an endless
crusade to undermine

38:25.126 --> 38:28.606
this president, all at the direction

38:28.630 --> 38:30.207
of Senator Hanson,

38:30.231 --> 38:33.344
who just last week was
peddling similar falsehoods

38:33.368 --> 38:35.646
about the rescue of
an American citizen

38:35.670 --> 38:37.781
who was kidnapped by Iran.

38:37.805 --> 38:40.884
Someone has to call these
hearings out for what they are.

38:40.908 --> 38:42.987
A political hatchet job.

38:43.011 --> 38:45.522
A campaign of endless harassment,

38:45.546 --> 38:47.224
not-not just on

38:47.248 --> 38:48.826
the president,

38:48.850 --> 38:51.001
but on reality.

38:51.986 --> 38:53.998
- And truth.
- (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)

38:54.022 --> 38:56.200
So, after the past few days

38:56.224 --> 38:58.502
and the exemplary

38:58.526 --> 39:01.538
leadership this president
has shown, I will no longer

39:01.562 --> 39:04.575
participate in a charade whose
sole purpose is to punish

39:04.599 --> 39:07.711
this president for her only real sin:

39:07.735 --> 39:10.547
Challenging our preconceptions
about what

39:10.571 --> 39:12.750
a president should be.

39:12.774 --> 39:14.718
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)

39:14.742 --> 39:16.687
And now I yield my time, Mr. Chairman.

39:16.711 --> 39:18.322
(APPLAUSE)

39:18.346 --> 39:20.024
- Order.

Yup, it's...

Well, it's also that.

Nope.

- No.

Holy... moley.

It's happening all over
the country, all 50 states.

public protest ever.

41:00.648 --> 41:02.526
What happened?

As far as they can tell,
it started with this

41:04.952 --> 41:06.296
ten-year-old girl from Atlanta

41:06.320 --> 41:08.399
who convinced her mom
to drive through the night

41:08.423 --> 41:11.201
so she could hold her sign
up by the gate down there.

41:11.225 --> 41:15.078

41:16.564 --> 41:18.842
"She's my president."

do was throw you out of office.

for impeachment was Canning's.
