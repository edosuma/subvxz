00:59.017 --> 01:00.098
Hey.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.808
What's up, man?

01:01.810 --> 01:03.226
Good?

01:03.228 --> 01:05.394
Yup.

01:05.397 --> 01:06.814
So how do I know these guys?

01:06.816 --> 01:10.234
You know, know my right.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.943
Would know these
frat boys'd be better

01:11.945 --> 01:14.237
if they weren't too pussy to
the try a real drug.

01:14.239 --> 01:16.909
What do you mean real drugs?

01:17.534 --> 01:22.329
I fuck like a beast when
I'm on that meth, brah.

01:22.331 --> 01:24.582
That's good to know, because?

01:24.584 --> 01:26.835
All right, here they come.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.592
Frat boys, huh?

01:35.594 --> 01:38.136
These look like the
fuckers I know.

01:38.138 --> 01:39.347
What's up?

01:39.349 --> 01:42.058
Don't tell me, I'm
trying to guess

01:42.060 --> 01:43.475
what frat you guys are in.

01:43.477 --> 01:47.020
How about fuck your mama,
that's what frat we're in.

01:47.022 --> 01:48.398
Hey, where Bobby at?

01:48.400 --> 01:50.190
Bobby's my little
brother, fuckhead.

01:50.192 --> 01:51.526
Well relax, dude.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.651
Bobby's the one who
made the deal with us

01:52.653 --> 01:54.112
so we're wondering where he is.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.487
Now you make the deal with me.

01:55.489 --> 01:56.323
Okay.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.865
Listen man, you
wanna do business

01:58.867 --> 02:02.162
or you want to stand
around and look tough?

02:04.123 --> 02:04.915
Come on.

02:07.209 --> 02:08.627
Let's do business.

02:09.836 --> 02:11.294
Got the cash?

02:11.296 --> 02:13.550
Give me the molly first.

02:15.175 --> 02:16.218
All right.

02:17.971 --> 02:18.805
It's okay?

02:24.644 --> 02:25.435
Fuck, cops!

02:25.437 --> 02:26.227
Fuck, man, run!

02:26.229 --> 02:27.519
Run, run, run!!

02:27.521 --> 02:29.774
Come on, come on, come on!

02:31.401 --> 02:32.402
Everybody run!

02:38.824 --> 02:42.327
Pleasure doing business
with you gentlemen.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.203
Mr. Jenkins.

02:45.205 --> 02:46.748
Perfect timing
as always, Eddie.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.541
The fuck is this shit?

02:48.543 --> 02:49.875
What, this?

02:49.877 --> 02:50.959
Sugar.

02:50.961 --> 02:52.336
Here, you can have it.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.505
Give it to Linda, maybe
she can make a pie with it.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.341
Don't talk about
my wife, asshole.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.344
We're not friends.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.346
If you ever let me run up on
a bunch of skinheads again

03:01.348 --> 03:04.809
without a warrant, I
will beat your ass.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.310
Sorry, what did you say?

03:07.312 --> 03:10.439
I was just thinking
about your wife's pie.

03:12.650 --> 03:29.957
Fucking smartass.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.125
Motherfucker!

03:31.127 --> 03:32.542
Fucker, what the fuck, man!?

03:34.338 --> 03:36.422
What the fuck wrong
with you, huh?

03:36.424 --> 03:38.215
Fucking cheat me, huh, cheat me?

03:38.217 --> 03:40.760
How dare you cheat me, huh?

03:40.762 --> 03:42.595
Fuck you, Carter.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.263
I don't trust your ass.

03:45.265 --> 03:48.434
The fuck did you
get nunchucks, man?

03:48.436 --> 03:49.396
Jesus fuck.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.116
Goddamnit.

04:51.540 --> 04:52.748
You're early.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.041
What are you doing here, Tom,

04:54.043 --> 04:55.334
I have until six
o'clock with him.

04:55.336 --> 04:56.377
You wanna fight
about the difference

04:56.379 --> 05:00.133
between 5:45 and six,
then you can lawyer up.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.343
Hey buddy, you
have to go, okay?

05:04.512 --> 05:05.553
I know you don't want to go.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.387
No, it doesn't mean
I don't love you.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.098
You're only acting like this

05:10.100 --> 05:12.560
because you know I can't
afford the custody battle.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.394
You can't, can you?

05:20.444 --> 05:23.029
Hey, what you say, Dolores?

05:23.031 --> 05:25.238
Carter, where's my 200 bucks?

05:25.240 --> 05:27.367
Next week, promise.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.409
Is he around?

05:28.411 --> 05:29.577
He's in his office.

05:29.579 --> 05:30.577
Cool, I'll just go say hi.

05:30.579 --> 05:32.247
Wait at the bar.

05:34.541 --> 05:36.250
Spot me a Jack on the rocks?

05:36.252 --> 05:38.670
You need to quit
trying me, Carter.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.755
You just think you're
so damn cute, don't you?

05:41.757 --> 05:42.839
Hi, Carter!

05:42.841 --> 05:44.425
Hi, darling.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.550
Hey you guys ever get that
raccoon out the house?

05:45.552 --> 05:46.594
No.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.053
Oh fuck.

05:48.055 --> 05:49.012
I need you to understand

05:49.014 --> 05:50.389
this is a simple business.

05:50.391 --> 05:53.267
But you can make yourself
a damn fine living

05:53.269 --> 05:56.269
provided you can
convince the hard dicks

05:56.271 --> 06:00.692
who come through here that if
they give you enough money,

06:00.694 --> 06:05.654
you might fuck them.

06:05.656 --> 06:09.409
See that's the common misconception
about the strip business

06:09.411 --> 06:11.702
it's not about tits
or ass or pussy,

06:11.704 --> 06:12.955
it's about the

06:14.415 --> 06:16.166
possibility of pussy.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.878
It's a con, pure and simple.

06:21.213 --> 06:24.382
These hard dick mouth breathers
will buy you cocktails

06:24.384 --> 06:27.260
and cocaine and throw as
much chit at your coochies

06:27.262 --> 06:28.719
you can catch under the pathetic

06:28.721 --> 06:32.139
misguided conception,
maybe tonight

06:32.141 --> 06:38.521
might just be the night
that you go home with them.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.315
That is of course, and this is
the important part, so focus.

06:41.317 --> 06:44.696
You never actually fuck them.

06:45.697 --> 06:46.531
Hmm?

06:48.574 --> 06:51.199
The second you do that, the
power flips, it's all over.

06:51.201 --> 06:55.497
And they won't even buy you
a plan B pill after that.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.339
Now I'm telling you this

07:04.798 --> 07:08.509
because I think you could
be one of the great ones.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.388
You've got the look.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.139
Do you have some daddy issues?

07:14.141 --> 07:16.392
Of course you do, who doesn't?

07:16.394 --> 07:18.685
That doesn't mean you
can't make some cash.

07:18.687 --> 07:20.521
I'm talking real cash
like Bennigan the money

07:20.523 --> 07:24.692
from back in the day, not
the bullshit Applebees crap.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.944
That's only working three
or four shifts a week.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.654
Spencer, what the fuck?

07:29.656 --> 07:31.115
What kind of nonsense
are you filling

07:31.117 --> 07:32.533
my baby's head with?

07:32.535 --> 07:35.452
Oh I'm merely offering
her some fatherly advice.

07:35.454 --> 07:39.123
Lord knows your daddy's not
doing it from prison is he?

07:39.125 --> 07:41.000
Come on baby, let's go
get you a cheeseburger

07:41.002 --> 07:42.918
and some soda pop.

07:42.920 --> 07:43.961
You come back when
you're ready honey,

07:43.963 --> 07:45.505
I'll still be here.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.423
Fuck you Spencer,
she's just a little girl.

07:47.425 --> 07:50.261
That you brought
to a titty bar.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.596
Carter's here.

07:54.598 --> 07:57.265
Is he now?

07:57.267 --> 08:00.560
Oh that bitch better
have my money.

08:00.562 --> 08:02.730
I had your money
in my fucking hands.

08:02.732 --> 08:03.772
That little prick
smacked me in the head

08:03.774 --> 08:04.731
and he took it.

08:04.733 --> 08:05.817
No.

08:05.819 --> 08:06.483
Yeah, can you
fucking believe that?

08:06.485 --> 08:07.567
I mean Jesus Christ?

08:07.569 --> 08:08.820
Whatever happened to
honor among thieves?

08:08.822 --> 08:09.820
So he struck you?

08:09.822 --> 08:11.488
Oh right here?

08:11.490 --> 08:12.656
Yeah, yeah, right, oh fuck!

08:12.658 --> 08:14.242
Your poor choice in partners

08:14.244 --> 08:15.618
is not my concern.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.120
At least when you
worked with June

08:17.122 --> 08:19.454
you had one functioning intellect
between the two of you.

08:19.456 --> 08:20.873
It's funny you mentioned June

08:20.875 --> 08:21.957
because I think she's finally
starting to come around.

08:21.959 --> 08:22.750
Really?

08:23.545 --> 08:25.002
Ow, goddammit.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.628
Think I give a fuck about
your couple's counseling?

08:26.630 --> 08:28.173
Okay, okay, okay.

08:30.759 --> 08:31.593
Here.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.095
I've made you a lot
of money in the past

08:35.097 --> 08:37.515
and I'll get you the
rest by tomorrow.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.767
I'll come up with
something, I always do.

08:40.769 --> 08:42.020
One day more and
you will pay me

08:42.022 --> 08:47.691
every cent you owe
me, do you understand?

08:47.693 --> 08:49.694
Now you made me late
for my luncheon.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.239
I hate tardiness.

08:52.407 --> 08:54.741
Albert, bring the
car around back!

08:54.743 --> 08:56.658
Is that a new ring you got?

08:56.660 --> 08:58.495
Feels like a new ring.

09:01.041 --> 09:01.958
Remember.

09:03.043 --> 09:09.796
Tomorrow by noon.

09:09.798 --> 09:10.632
Hey!

09:11.717 --> 09:13.092
Do you work here?

09:13.094 --> 09:15.677
Sadly, yes, that
is my cross to bear.

09:15.679 --> 09:17.220
I wanna know what the
hell we're supposed to do

09:17.222 --> 09:19.015
with this damn funny money here.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.641
They didn't tell us we
can't change it back

09:20.643 --> 09:22.810
for real money if and we want.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.561
And they say it
don't work in the bar

09:24.563 --> 09:26.772
nor the buffet neither!

09:26.774 --> 09:28.940
Now surely both of you
been in the country fair.

09:28.942 --> 09:30.151
It's the same principle.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.401
That's bullshit.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.536
I just lit that cigarette.

09:59.807 --> 10:04.060
See now they, just
accosted me physically.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.853
You have accosted my finances.

10:06.855 --> 10:11.108
You care hazard a guess
which one offends me more?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.318
I will never
understand the allure

10:12.320 --> 10:14.155
of a titty bar buffet.

10:15.823 --> 10:16.656
Why the fuck are you still here?

10:16.658 --> 10:18.534
Go, steal something.

10:20.495 --> 10:23.579
Albert, where the
fuck have you been?

10:31.047 --> 10:33.881
Caitlin, long time no talk.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.215
Carter honey, I'm
gonna be quick about this

10:35.217 --> 10:36.843
but how would you
like to help me steal

10:36.845 --> 10:38.594
half a million dollars?

10:38.596 --> 10:40.430
you serious?

10:40.432 --> 10:42.431
I never joke about money.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.892
Spencer got me a job
working at a bank.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.352
Spencer,
he's involved in this?

10:46.354 --> 10:48.478
He planted me there
a couple months ago

10:48.480 --> 10:50.064
to scope the place out and,

10:50.066 --> 10:51.733
now he's gonna make his move.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.693
What do you need me for?

10:53.695 --> 10:56.112
Spencer wants to move me
to Shreveport after the heist

10:56.114 --> 10:58.531
and this pussy I'm working with

10:58.533 --> 11:00.699
wants us to start a
life up there together.

11:00.701 --> 11:04.203
As far as I'm concerned,
married life ain't for me.

11:04.205 --> 11:07.123
I need a man who's a
pro who I can trust.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.584
You help me with the plan, and

11:09.586 --> 11:10.917
the other half is yours.

11:10.919 --> 11:12.795
You want me to
double-cross Spencer?

11:12.797 --> 11:14.964
Well yeah problem is,
it's never that easy.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.175
Whatever, you want
the money or not?

11:17.177 --> 11:19.259
Yeah, okay, all right.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.719
Meet me at Dino's?

11:20.721 --> 11:22.012
No, no, handsome.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.306
We'll discuss this at my place.

11:24.308 --> 11:25.098
No, no, no, no.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.392
Not the dungeon.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.602
I told you, I'm not
really into that.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.103
Who you talking to?

11:29.105 --> 11:31.397
Um, just one of my clients.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.066
He wanted to tell me
his wife is out of town.

11:34.068 --> 11:37.945
I'm thinking about a
Pecan farm in Monroe, baby.

11:37.947 --> 11:44.118
Yeah.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.411
Mr. Rabbit,
can I ask you a question?

11:46.413 --> 11:48.373
You already have.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.041
Does this look real to you?

11:50.043 --> 11:51.291
Jesus Christ, Albert,

11:51.293 --> 11:52.542
get that thing out of my car.

11:52.544 --> 11:53.752
I bought it for 20.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.421
I wanna know if
they ripped me off.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.964
Well I don't know.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.965
Why don't you go on to
a field, pull the pin

11:58.967 --> 12:00.343
and if it blows your half
brain Cajun ass to bits

12:00.345 --> 12:01.469
you'll know it's real.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.222
Well that's not very nice.

12:10.562 --> 12:12.229
What gray fuckery is this?

12:12.231 --> 12:14.192
This is the way
you told me to go.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.781
Well does he just
expect me to walk?

12:21.783 --> 12:24.157
We could
drive up if you like.

12:24.159 --> 12:25.493
Ah fuck it, I'll walk.

12:25.495 --> 12:26.493
You sure?

12:26.495 --> 12:27.704
That's fine.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.372
I just wish the prick
bastard had told me.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.793
I'd have worn different boots.

12:37.381 --> 12:38.549
Well fuck me.

12:42.636 --> 12:43.969
Keep talking.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.430
All you have to do is
distract homeboy enough

12:45.432 --> 12:47.223
for me to sneak in and
switch the envelopes

12:47.225 --> 12:50.267
and then hit the silent
alarm if everything goes down

12:50.269 --> 12:52.060
and we'll let the cops
come in and they'll

12:52.062 --> 12:53.898
get rid of the competition.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.108
Think you can handle that?

12:58.110 --> 13:02.738
What if to distract him,
he takes me into the vault

13:02.740 --> 13:05.616
and rapes me?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.325
Okay, whatever, Caitlin,
whatever game you have to play,

13:07.327 --> 13:10.037
just distract him somehow.

13:10.039 --> 13:13.833
Just keep him out of
our way long enough.

13:13.835 --> 13:17.002
Trust me.

13:17.004 --> 13:19.171
Once I get a hold
of a man's junk,

13:19.173 --> 13:21.007
I can make him do anything.

13:21.009 --> 13:23.092
It's like my superpower.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.680
I know, okay I believe you.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.059
But in the meantime,
we need to come

13:31.061 --> 13:32.935
to an understanding.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.771
Wait, what are you?

13:34.773 --> 13:36.147
Hang on, you said whoah,

13:36.149 --> 13:37.065
you said you were gonna
give me a light spanking.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.608
I didn't say spanking.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.694
I said paddling.

13:41.696 --> 13:44.532
And who said
anything about light?

13:46.283 --> 13:47.574
Oh, fuck!

13:59.129 --> 14:00.379
Hello, boys.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.089
You know the
drill, Mr. Rabbit.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.007
Are you kidding?

14:04.009 --> 14:06.178
This is my favorite part.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.975
Ooh, careful, that's a 38.

14:15.647 --> 14:16.436
Pull!

14:20.402 --> 14:22.151
Cockeyed piece of shit.

14:22.153 --> 14:22.986
Pull!

14:26.490 --> 14:27.324
Goddammit!

14:29.952 --> 14:31.118
Reed, what the hell
are we doing out here?

14:31.120 --> 14:31.993
I thought we were
having a proper lunch.

14:31.995 --> 14:33.329
I'm famished.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.080
Boy, you look like a
goddamn Mardi Gras float.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.999
Well I dressed
down for you today.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.835
Nobody will respect me as
the Commissioner of the Force

14:39.837 --> 14:41.587
if they knew I fraternize with,

14:41.589 --> 14:43.714
well, people like you.

14:43.716 --> 14:48.219
Vegetarians?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.512
Pull!

14:51.975 --> 14:53.308
Son of a bitch!

14:54.019 --> 14:57.686
Yes, they did get away
from you, didn't they?

14:57.688 --> 15:01.023
Well, you think
you can do better?

15:01.025 --> 15:02.983
Well I could give it a go.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.068
Get him a gun.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.280
Yes sir.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.282
Thank you.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.077
Pull.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.999
You keep both eyes open
when you fire a shotgun.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.335
The trick is to not overthink it

15:21.337 --> 15:23.338
much like most things in life.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.131
Just a little friendly advice.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.927
Shut up and give
me my damn money.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.972
Looks like you're about
10 grand short here.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.348
It's a slow week at the club.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.599
You'll get the rest of
your money by Monday.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.225
I better.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.518
You got no idea how much it cost

15:38.520 --> 15:40.103
to be respectable
at this day and age.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.357
Oh I know buying you and your
boys cannot be cheap.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.441
You damn skippy
it ain't cheap.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.069
These things looking
the other way

15:46.071 --> 15:47.487
when you're unloading
the shipment.

15:47.489 --> 15:49.781
And do I need to remind you
that longshoremen are union?

15:49.783 --> 15:51.991
And so are the truck drivers
that look the other way

15:51.993 --> 15:54.493
when some whiskey falls off
the back of their truck?

15:54.495 --> 15:55.911
I'm well aware of
the sway you feel

15:55.913 --> 15:58.415
you hold over me, commissioner.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.420
I feel, do I?

16:03.922 --> 16:05.088
We'll see how much sway I have

16:05.090 --> 16:07.214
when you start applying
for your permits

16:07.216 --> 16:10.008
for that new titty bar
down on the corner.

16:10.010 --> 16:13.095
I got friends everywhere.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.472
You have friends?

16:14.474 --> 16:16.306
Or you have dirt on friends?

16:16.308 --> 16:17.434
Same thing.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.105
So, that'll be ten K by Friday.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.690
And if you want the
permits for those girls

16:24.692 --> 16:27.776
to show their tits
at your new club,

16:27.778 --> 16:29.027
you're gonna give
me a downpayment

16:29.029 --> 16:31.196
on your new bar by Monday.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.449
5,000 and a case of
scotch do the trick?

16:33.451 --> 16:35.077
Try 150, smartass.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.912
But I will take
that case of scotch.

16:38.914 --> 16:41.248
You son of a bitch,
you're serious.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.668
Oh, my, yes sir.

16:43.461 --> 16:44.712
150 by Monday.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.425
Get, go on.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.219
Say hi to dad for me.

16:53.221 --> 16:56.263
My papa never
cheated on my mama!

16:56.265 --> 16:59.934
And he never sired
no bastard queer son!

16:59.936 --> 17:00.729
Never!

17:02.605 --> 17:03.729
Pull!

17:13.490 --> 17:15.074
This is bad timing.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.701
You are absolutely the last
person I want to see right now.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.119
I just, I need five
minutes, that's it.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.371
No.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.288
I have a job
lined up right now

17:21.290 --> 17:22.582
that can solve all my problems!

17:22.584 --> 17:25.209
You're my
problem, Carter!

17:25.211 --> 17:27.838
I can help you get Ethan back.

17:33.678 --> 17:34.512
I mean it.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.228
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.229
Commissioner Reed has a
private safe at a bank

17:46.231 --> 17:48.357
with a shit ton of money in it.

17:48.359 --> 17:50.067
Correct.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.487
And Spencer's gonna
rob it using a hired gun

17:52.489 --> 17:53.696
and an inside man.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.073
Correct.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.365
And how do you know
this information?

17:56.367 --> 17:58.367
From Caitlin.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.495
Freaky Caitlin?

18:00.497 --> 18:02.162
How does she know?

18:02.164 --> 18:04.873
She's the inside man.

18:04.875 --> 18:13.257
And how did you
get her to trust you?

18:13.259 --> 18:19.096
Eww.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.847
Those vaults require two keys.

18:20.849 --> 18:21.891
The first key is easy.

18:21.893 --> 18:22.892
But the second key,

18:22.894 --> 18:24.142
Is a client of Caitlin's.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.562
She made a copy.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.814
I always thought
she was too clever

18:27.816 --> 18:29.524
just to be a stripper.

18:29.526 --> 18:30.565
Yeah, she's clever.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.317
She's also fucking insane.

18:32.319 --> 18:36.363
She's gonna cut my dick off
if I fuck this up for her.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.032
June, just look at
this smug bastard.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.574
He's just begging us
to take his money.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.702
I don't know.

18:41.704 --> 18:44.455
I mean I'm desperate
but, this is,

18:44.457 --> 18:46.790
This is a big score.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.875
You don't know exactly how
much money is in that safe

18:48.877 --> 18:52.546
but there's enough for
Spencer to take a big risk.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.800
I can't do it without you.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.180
So what's the plan?

19:07.271 --> 19:10.731
The plan requires a
briefcase with a false bottom.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.986
One antique clock,
and perfect timing.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.196
Yes?

19:17.198 --> 19:18.363
Hello, Mr.

19:18.365 --> 19:19.407
Freely.

19:19.409 --> 19:20.449
Freely.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.075
How
may I help you?

19:22.077 --> 19:23.745
It's my understanding
that this is the only bank

19:23.747 --> 19:26.413
in New Orleans with
a class four vault.

19:26.415 --> 19:30.334
My client, Mr. Germain Bubli
would like to rent a box

19:30.336 --> 19:31.253
for 48 hours.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.297
Well, we have a very
secure bank vault room

19:35.299 --> 19:37.674
complete with magnetic locks.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.344
Excellent.

19:39.346 --> 19:42.055
That's precisely the degree
of security that we expect.

19:42.057 --> 19:44.140
But our private
banking services require

19:44.142 --> 19:47.727
an account balance of at
least 100,000 dollars.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.480
Mr. Freely.

19:51.482 --> 19:55.276
My client is in possession
of a unique artifact.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.527
Very rare.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.240
You're going to
want to see this.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.160
Right this way.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.746
In here is where we
keep our cash reserves

20:06.748 --> 20:08.583
and our private boxes.

20:10.085 --> 20:14.338
And as you can see, this vault
is absolutely impenetrable.

20:21.471 --> 20:22.761
Pardon the construction.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.515
Of course.

20:28.435 --> 20:41.905
Rest assured, there will be
zero compromise to security.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.366
You said Marie
Antoinette owned it?

20:44.368 --> 20:45.994
Yes, and Napoleon.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.581
No, no, no, no!

20:50.583 --> 20:54.838
Your breath can contribute
to oxidizing the metal.

20:55.713 --> 20:56.755
Of course.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.297
Merci.

20:59.299 --> 21:02.927
Well, all of our boxes
here are on a two key system.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.846
The red key is for the client.

21:05.848 --> 21:10.185
And the blue key, which is
kept by bank management.

21:17.152 --> 21:21.403
Do you think this will be
sufficient for your needs?

21:21.405 --> 21:24.032
Let's go, everybody
down, get out!

21:27.494 --> 21:29.411
What in Sam Hell is?

21:29.413 --> 21:30.787
Excuse me for just a moment.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.123
I'll be right back.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.459
To the minute.

21:35.461 --> 21:36.835
Just like old times.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.504
I think you telling
him not to breathe on it

21:38.506 --> 21:41.966
really sold it.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.383
Don't even think about it!

21:43.385 --> 21:45.053
Get down on the ground!

21:45.055 --> 21:46.970
Now get your ass over here!

21:46.972 --> 21:49.431
Get down, hurry your ass up!

21:49.433 --> 21:50.767
Let's go, hurry up!

21:50.769 --> 21:51.685
Get down!

22:05.450 --> 22:07.533
You, get your
ass up, let's go.

22:07.535 --> 22:08.325
Get up, get your ass up!

22:08.327 --> 22:09.201
No, no, please!

22:09.203 --> 22:10.661
No, no, please!

22:10.663 --> 22:11.703
Please don't hurt me, no!

22:11.705 --> 22:13.706
Don't shoot me, don't rape me.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.248
Please, I'm a virgin!

22:15.250 --> 22:16.086
Shut up!

22:18.712 --> 22:19.547
Relax.

22:20.923 --> 22:21.963
Please don't hurt me!

22:21.965 --> 22:23.716
Please don't hurt me, please!

22:23.718 --> 22:25.428
Please don't hurt me!

22:28.138 --> 22:30.597
Hey, hey, knock this shit off

22:30.599 --> 22:32.726
and open the fucking box.

22:45.448 --> 22:46.905
There's only half a mill here.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.533
Hurry, hurry, come on.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.492
There's an extra three
million in the cash reserve.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.619
Baby you're out of
your fucking mind.

22:51.621 --> 22:52.953
Spencer said...

22:52.955 --> 22:55.623
Do you want your pecan
farm in Monroe, baby, huh?

22:55.625 --> 22:57.083
Yeah?

22:57.085 --> 22:58.959
Come here, come on.

22:58.961 --> 23:00.004
Take it off.

23:16.645 --> 23:17.978
Lord almighty.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.691
Oh, fuck, goddamnit!

23:21.067 --> 23:22.650
Shots fired in New
Orleans Bank And Trust

23:22.652 --> 23:24.485
at the corner of
Common and Crondolette.

23:24.487 --> 23:26.612
Roger that,
we're sending SWAT.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.074
Wait for backup.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.615
What the fuck is happening?

23:30.617 --> 23:34.411
I thought these guys were pros.

23:37.875 --> 23:40.418
Police, freeze, nobody move!

23:53.016 --> 23:54.431
Ah!

23:56.644 --> 23:59.019
There's one more in the vault.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.896
Roger that, I'm going in.

24:03.902 --> 24:05.528
Police, nobody move!

24:24.005 --> 24:26.881
Oh, dear lord.

24:45.734 --> 24:46.526
If I distract the cop,

24:46.528 --> 24:48.486
can you get
the keys from Caitlin.

24:48.488 --> 24:49.696
You sure?

24:49.698 --> 24:51.825
New plan, follow my lead.

24:53.076 --> 24:53.910
Hello?

24:54.952 --> 24:56.451
Who is that?

24:56.453 --> 24:59.162
We're hostages,
behind the tarp.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.623
Hey we're coming
out, do not shoot, okay?

25:01.625 --> 25:05.670
There's two of
us and we're unarmed.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.923
All right, here we come.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.382
What is that?

25:10.384 --> 25:12.677
On the table now, now!

25:12.679 --> 25:14.723
Okay, okay, briefcase.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.728
Who are you?

25:22.730 --> 25:24.896
We heard the shooting
and we hid behind the tarp.

25:24.898 --> 25:29.651
We saw everything.

25:29.653 --> 25:31.362
I killed her!

25:31.364 --> 25:33.280
I killed a hostage.

25:33.282 --> 25:35.451
That's not what we saw.

25:37.662 --> 25:40.955
What we saw was a
horrible killer come

25:40.957 --> 25:42.914
and try to rape that
poor innocent girl

25:42.916 --> 25:46.251
who definitely didn't
want to be raped.

25:46.253 --> 25:49.756
And when she
resisted, he shot her

25:49.758 --> 25:53.676
and you, you saved
us from being next.

25:53.678 --> 25:54.677
That's true.

25:54.679 --> 25:56.804
That's exactly what I saw too.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.016
Thank you so
much for saving us!

26:00.018 --> 26:02.684
Thank you so much
for saving our lives.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.019
It was so scary.

26:04.021 --> 26:06.064
Oh, I'm so sorry, are you, oh,

26:06.066 --> 26:07.690
oh, that looks
awful, are you okay?

26:07.692 --> 26:08.732
Yeah.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.276
Twitty.

26:10.278 --> 26:11.361
Are you okay?

26:11.363 --> 26:13.573
Yeah, code four, I'm okay.

26:14.699 --> 26:23.748
I'm okay.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.590
What do you mean
they're all dead?

27:14.592 --> 27:16.426
I thought these
fucksticks were supposed

27:16.428 --> 27:18.177
to be professionals.

27:18.179 --> 27:19.845
Dirty business robbing banks.

27:19.847 --> 27:22.890
Sometimes it pays,
sometimes it doesn't.

27:22.892 --> 27:24.892
How the hell am I supposed
to pay the prick Reed

27:24.894 --> 27:26.686
back by tomorrow?

27:26.688 --> 27:28.895
I don't have that kind of cash.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.690
Use the downpayment on
the new lease, I guess.

27:30.692 --> 27:31.734
Fuck that!

27:33.068 --> 27:36.069
I'm not giving that
asshole my future.

27:37.865 --> 27:40.826
Tell Albert to pull
the car around.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.036
Shouldn't you be
swinging on a pole

27:43.038 --> 27:44.873
or some goddamn thing?

27:47.041 --> 27:48.749
So how's this gonna work?

27:48.751 --> 27:49.792
Did you happen to take a look

27:49.794 --> 27:51.044
at what type of gun
the cop was carrying?

27:51.046 --> 27:52.711
A standard issue Glock, why?

27:52.713 --> 27:54.881
Glock, 40 caliber to be exact.

27:54.883 --> 27:56.173
Did you happen to
see what type of gun

27:56.175 --> 27:57.924
the would be robber
was carrying?

27:57.926 --> 28:01.970
Remington 45 ACP 1911
style, very high end.

28:01.972 --> 28:03.555
Okay.

28:03.557 --> 28:06.017
Very different bullets,
very different holes.

28:06.019 --> 28:07.809
Ah, holes are important.

28:07.811 --> 28:11.480
Here, he's turning,
don't lose him.

28:11.482 --> 28:12.940
We are witnesses, though.

28:12.942 --> 28:14.566
I mean you think it's
gonna be that easy

28:14.568 --> 28:16.779
just to waltz back in there?

28:17.571 --> 28:19.738
The manager on a
gurney and a big hero cop

28:19.740 --> 28:21.324
leading our way, piece of pie.

28:21.326 --> 28:22.451
I love pie.

28:25.954 --> 28:28.331
I was under
that 711 sign.

28:28.333 --> 28:30.833
And that's when the
lord came to me.

28:30.835 --> 28:33.335
Oh, is he gonna come to me?

28:33.337 --> 28:35.129
Oh, not yet baby.

28:35.131 --> 28:37.840
When he came to me
I was on the drink.

28:37.842 --> 28:38.882
I was on the drink.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.634
Mhmm, I was on the pipe.

28:40.636 --> 28:41.969
I was on the pipe.

28:41.971 --> 28:43.680
Mhmm I was on my knees.

28:43.682 --> 28:46.891
Oh god, mama,
Jesus, Mary night!

28:46.893 --> 28:48.726
Then he came to me
and he said Lucas,

28:48.728 --> 28:50.561
the world is full of sin.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.145
Oh, it is so full!

28:52.147 --> 28:56.234
And you, as a sinner can
lead the other sinners!

28:56.236 --> 28:57.485
Oh you lead them baby.

28:57.487 --> 28:58.819
You lead them now!

29:04.411 --> 29:06.160
Thank you Jesus.

29:06.162 --> 29:07.161
Thank you.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.962
And so, what else
did God tell you?

29:16.964 --> 29:19.257
That he wants me
to start a church.

29:19.259 --> 29:21.299
A church for sinners
where it's okay to sin

29:21.301 --> 29:23.219
so long as you ask the
Lord for forgiveness

29:23.221 --> 29:25.345
when you're done.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.265
Forgive me Lord.

29:27.267 --> 29:28.807
You know, a cool church.

29:28.809 --> 29:31.436
Yeah, but don't
all churches do that?

29:31.438 --> 29:33.020
Like ain't they all for sinners?

29:33.022 --> 29:35.023
But they judge you.

29:35.025 --> 29:36.481
Why in this church,

29:36.483 --> 29:38.401
Oh shit, Jason's home.

29:38.403 --> 29:40.154
I got it, I got it.

29:42.865 --> 29:44.116
Honey, baby.

29:46.493 --> 29:47.661
Where you at?

29:49.705 --> 29:51.163
Oh sweet Lord almighty, Jason,

29:51.165 --> 29:53.040
what happened to you?

29:53.042 --> 29:55.500
I committed the
worst sin there is.

29:55.502 --> 29:56.462
Adultery?

29:57.922 --> 30:00.590
Or, no, not that bad.

30:00.592 --> 30:01.426
Murder.

30:10.727 --> 30:12.017
We need to get back in there

30:12.019 --> 30:15.565
before Reed empties the
safe or changes locks.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.109
Follow my lead.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.199
Always do.

30:26.576 --> 30:29.951
So, you saw my Jason
kill that innocent girl

30:29.953 --> 30:31.996
and you all just lied about it?

30:31.998 --> 30:33.956
Well, listen, it was an
accident, we all know that.

30:33.958 --> 30:35.958
It could happen
to anyone, right?

30:35.960 --> 30:37.709
It could have
happened to anyone.

30:37.711 --> 30:41.046
But it's what
you do now that matters.

30:41.048 --> 30:42.882
We wanna help you, Jason.

30:42.884 --> 30:45.133
We wanna help you
make a wonderful thing

30:45.135 --> 30:47.178
out of a terrible thing.

30:47.180 --> 30:50.014
It's all terrible, all of it.

30:50.016 --> 30:53.226
No, it could be
much, much worse.

30:53.228 --> 30:54.602
True.

30:54.604 --> 30:55.978
All the medical
examiner has to do

30:55.980 --> 30:57.438
is take a look at the
ballistics of the gunshots

30:57.440 --> 30:58.980
and your career would be over,

30:58.982 --> 31:01.316
you would be imprisoned
for the rest of your life.

31:01.318 --> 31:03.111
Would you say that
second degree murder

31:03.113 --> 31:05.113
and witness tampering
would land one in Angola?

31:05.115 --> 31:06.488
Angola?

31:06.490 --> 31:07.699
I certainly would.

31:07.701 --> 31:09.033
She would.

31:09.035 --> 31:12.577
Or very big men will do
very bad things to you.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.955
They hate cops in Angola.

31:13.957 --> 31:14.956
Tell me about it.

31:14.958 --> 31:16.248
Officer Twitty.

31:16.250 --> 31:19.960
Young, handsome,
fit, Officer Twitty.

31:19.962 --> 31:21.796
But, there's another way.

31:21.798 --> 31:22.796
A better way.

31:22.798 --> 31:23.965
A better way.

31:23.967 --> 31:26.049
A way in which we
would all profit.

31:26.051 --> 31:29.136
And all we need is five
minutes alone in that vault.

31:29.138 --> 31:31.096
You don't even have
to do anything, Jason.

31:31.098 --> 31:32.347
You just walk us in there

31:32.349 --> 31:34.017
and 100,000 dollars
of it is yours.

31:34.019 --> 31:35.226
We'll even talk to our friends

31:35.228 --> 31:36.811
at the coroner's
office and everything.

31:36.813 --> 31:38.230
I hear you Lord.

31:39.441 --> 31:42.357
You do realize that
that's stealing, right?

31:42.359 --> 31:45.068
Well if it helps, don't
look at it like stealing.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.487
Look at it as blackmail.

31:46.489 --> 31:47.697
I'm a police officer.

31:47.699 --> 31:49.323
I'm sworn to uphold the law.

31:49.325 --> 31:50.866
Well technically,
you're also sworn

31:50.868 --> 31:52.535
not to shoot innocent
people in the face.

31:52.537 --> 31:55.162
Hey, you two get the heck
out of my house, right now!

31:55.164 --> 31:56.956
Now Jason!

31:56.958 --> 31:59.249
It is not Christian like
to shout at our guests.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.044
Sit down.

32:00.961 --> 32:02.047
Sit!

32:03.964 --> 32:06.967
Now, is this 100,000
American Dollars?

32:16.019 --> 32:18.018
Think he'll do it?

32:18.020 --> 32:19.937
There's two types of
women in this world.

32:19.939 --> 32:21.855
Those who would never
give a trucker a rim job

32:21.857 --> 32:23.982
in the bathroom in exchange
for cash and cocaine,

32:23.984 --> 32:25.985
and women like Darlie Mae.

32:25.987 --> 32:27.027
That chick?

32:27.029 --> 32:28.528
Trust me, I know her type.

32:28.530 --> 32:31.114
She's in there right now
leaning on him, promise.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.116
All right.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.120
So, where to?

32:36.247 --> 32:37.289
Home.

32:38.583 --> 32:40.248
Separate homes.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.249
I was just thinking.

32:41.251 --> 32:43.044
No, don't think.

32:43.046 --> 32:44.629
Tomorrow's a big day.

32:44.631 --> 32:45.673
All right.

32:48.218 --> 32:50.759
Listen, if all goes well,

32:50.761 --> 32:55.849
maybe, just maybe, we
can go have one drink.

32:57.602 --> 32:58.642
Open the door.

32:58.644 --> 32:59.602
I'm gonna hold you to that.

32:59.604 --> 33:02.104
Yeah, I bet you are.

33:02.106 --> 33:06.150
A drop of something
cheerful, darling.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.276
Okay, they're gone.

33:08.278 --> 33:09.114
Baby,

33:10.865 --> 33:12.864
I don't know if I can do this.

33:12.866 --> 33:15.159
Yeah but that's an
awful lot of money.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.120
I know.

33:17.122 --> 33:19.538
I got an idea.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.958
How about you go and wash up

33:21.960 --> 33:24.084
and then we can have some dinner

33:24.086 --> 33:26.211
and we can pray over it?

33:26.213 --> 33:27.630
And then maybe if
you're good later

33:27.632 --> 33:29.676
then we can fool around.

33:31.135 --> 33:33.260
Sound good, sugar?

33:33.262 --> 33:34.053
I love you.

33:34.055 --> 33:35.265
You too, babe.

33:43.856 --> 33:44.771
Is he gone?

33:44.773 --> 33:46.065
I just sent him for a shower.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.400
We gotta talk about this.

33:47.402 --> 33:50.111
You gotta make sure
he gets that money.

33:50.113 --> 33:51.319
The Lord told me.

33:51.321 --> 33:52.863
He talked to you again?

33:52.865 --> 33:54.574
While I was in the closet.

33:54.576 --> 33:57.075
He made all this happen
so that we can start

33:57.077 --> 33:58.786
our own church!

33:58.788 --> 34:00.287
Our church?

34:00.289 --> 34:03.623
I'm gonna make
you my Tammy Faye!

34:03.625 --> 34:04.461
Who?

34:06.378 --> 34:08.128
Just make sure
he does it, okay?

34:08.130 --> 34:09.170
Okay.

34:09.172 --> 34:10.088
Now go.

34:10.090 --> 34:12.344
Gimme a kiss, gimme a kiss.

34:20.143 --> 34:22.016
Hey when you said Twitty
was young, fit, handsome,

34:22.018 --> 34:24.811
Officer Twitty, how...

34:24.813 --> 34:25.603
Oh shit.

34:27.483 --> 34:28.940
The usual.

34:28.943 --> 34:30.233
I act drunk and belligerent,
call you a retard

34:30.235 --> 34:32.527
until the cop feels bad
enough to let us go?

34:32.530 --> 34:33.652
Oh, you're out
of practice, baby.

34:33.655 --> 34:35.030
He was waiting for us.

34:35.032 --> 34:37.239
Seriously?

34:37.242 --> 34:39.202
Wait a second.

34:39.204 --> 34:40.369
Oh, it's just Eddie.

34:40.371 --> 34:41.623
Who's Eddie?

34:43.625 --> 34:45.585
How you doing, Eddie?

34:47.378 --> 34:50.795
Hey man, got to bring you in.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.255
Questioning and charges?

34:52.257 --> 34:54.300
Pick him up at Eighth and Maple.

34:54.302 --> 34:55.135
Gretna.

34:56.429 --> 34:57.262
Let's go.

35:04.186 --> 35:06.561
Eighth and Maple and Gretna?

35:06.563 --> 35:09.108
That's not police headquarters.

35:22.371 --> 35:24.246
Here we are.

35:24.248 --> 35:26.164
You mention our
little arrangement,

35:26.166 --> 35:29.168
Aw come on, I didn't get
this far by being stupid.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.713
That's debatable.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.262
Well.

35:40.264 --> 35:41.181
Mr. Jennings.

35:42.559 --> 35:45.184
I'm Detective
Lieutenant Duke Johnson.

35:45.186 --> 35:46.646
How you doing?

35:57.532 --> 35:58.992
Look familiar?

36:03.954 --> 36:06.748
It's hard to tell with the
bullet wound to the head.

36:06.750 --> 36:08.416
Let me see if I can help you.

36:08.418 --> 36:12.172
Her name is, was,
Caitlin Jackson.

36:12.672 --> 36:14.713
She worked at a bar
called the Rabbit Hole.

36:14.715 --> 36:18.217
At the same time your girlfriend
Miss O'Malley was there.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.635
I don't know if you've ever
been to the Rabbit Hole sir,

36:20.637 --> 36:22.262
but a lot of girls work there.

36:22.264 --> 36:25.057
Two months later,
she got herself a job

36:25.059 --> 36:27.684
working at the very bank
that you and Miss O'Malley

36:27.686 --> 36:30.188
walked into this morning.

36:30.190 --> 36:31.313
Until she got her head shot up

36:31.315 --> 36:34.275
by a notorious bank
robber from Miami.

36:34.277 --> 36:37.235
I mean, what are the odds?

36:37.237 --> 36:38.570
People still play the lottery.

36:38.572 --> 36:40.030
What were you and
Miss O'Malley doing

36:40.032 --> 36:42.617
at the bank this morning?

36:42.619 --> 36:44.452
Depositing a check.

36:44.454 --> 36:45.744
And you and Miss
O'Malley didn't know

36:45.746 --> 36:47.621
a bank robbery was gonna happen?

36:47.623 --> 36:49.289
No, sir, I had no idea.

36:49.291 --> 36:52.043
Probably would have
picked a different bank.

36:52.045 --> 36:54.503
See it's pretty coincidental
that a known felon

36:54.505 --> 36:57.465
and his felon girlfriend
showed up to a bank robbery

36:57.467 --> 36:59.300
and left unscathed.

36:59.302 --> 37:01.760
Eh, number one, neither
of us were ever convicted

37:01.762 --> 37:04.262
of any of those things so
we're not technically felons.

37:04.264 --> 37:07.268
And B, she's not
really my girlfriend.

37:08.644 --> 37:09.896
That's good.

37:11.313 --> 37:14.356
Say, Eddie, let me get
a moment with him alone.

37:14.358 --> 37:16.943
Yes, sir.

37:16.945 --> 37:19.197
I appreciate you, Eddie.

37:23.367 --> 37:27.077
See the uniform guys
didn't take it seriously.

37:27.079 --> 37:30.289
Well see these people didn't
even go for the cash reserve.

37:30.291 --> 37:33.001
They were looking for something.

37:33.003 --> 37:35.420
What do you suppose
that is, Mr. Jennings?

37:35.422 --> 37:38.380
Ah, that I couldn't tell you.

37:38.382 --> 37:41.176
I absolutely think you could.

37:44.179 --> 37:45.722
You have any idea
why I brought you

37:45.724 --> 37:49.349
down here today, Mr. Jennings?

37:49.351 --> 37:50.684
I'm gonna give it a shot.

37:50.686 --> 37:52.561
You wanted to bring me
someplace intimidating

37:52.563 --> 37:54.188
that let's me know
your full force

37:54.190 --> 37:56.106
has a police lieutenant
but isn't full of cops

37:56.108 --> 37:59.276
with big ears and
even bigger mouths.

37:59.278 --> 38:00.737
That's why you had
Eddie bring me down here

38:00.739 --> 38:04.407
because Eddie knows how
to keep his mouth shut.

38:04.409 --> 38:05.326
Am I close?

38:08.579 --> 38:12.916
You're not as dumb as I
thought you were, Carter.

38:14.126 --> 38:15.418
I'm sorry.

38:15.420 --> 38:18.213
You asked daddy for a band aid?

38:20.175 --> 38:21.340
I know.

38:21.342 --> 38:22.383
I know, it's gonna be okay.

38:22.385 --> 38:24.304
You're a big boy, okay?

38:25.347 --> 38:26.762
All right.

38:26.764 --> 38:28.055
Okay.

38:28.057 --> 38:30.516
I love you, I love you.

38:30.518 --> 38:34.394
Okay, bye.

38:38.150 --> 38:41.445
Hey, did they know
anything, what happened?

38:43.114 --> 38:44.615
Just a shakedown.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.657
They dragged out Caitlin's body.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.284
They still think
the robber shot her.

38:49.286 --> 38:52.204
What else do they know?

38:52.206 --> 38:54.166
Less than they think.

38:58.003 --> 38:58.836
Plan's still on?

38:58.838 --> 39:00.798
Yeah, plan's still on.

39:02.467 --> 39:04.383
Okay.

39:04.385 --> 39:24.320
Get me home.

39:29.619 --> 39:30.577
Oh, shit.

39:35.333 --> 39:36.751
Oh hey, what's up?

39:39.586 --> 39:41.170
You guys aren't working?

39:41.172 --> 39:43.255
Not at the club.

39:43.257 --> 39:44.091
Oh.

40:00.858 --> 40:02.693
Why, you in a hurry?

40:06.447 --> 40:09.072
Where are you going
so in a hurry, huh?

40:09.074 --> 40:10.615
I wonder why.

40:10.617 --> 40:11.617
Mr. Rabbit.

40:11.619 --> 40:12.909
You are stupid to even realize

40:12.911 --> 40:14.787
how much trouble you're
really in, aren't you?

40:14.789 --> 40:15.623
Uh, no?

40:17.125 --> 40:20.459
Did we or did we not have
an appointment today at noon?

40:20.461 --> 40:21.793
We did, I'm sorry, I just,

40:22.797 --> 40:24.171
And have I not
made my position

40:24.173 --> 40:26.298
on tardiness perfectly clear?

40:26.300 --> 40:27.633
Yes you have.

40:27.635 --> 40:28.633
I know you're kinda
sick of hearing this

40:28.635 --> 40:30.427
but I swear I had the
money in my hands.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.347
I have to take this.

40:34.391 --> 40:36.767
You may speak.

40:36.769 --> 40:39.729
Oh, I don't know Sebastian.

40:39.731 --> 40:42.356
Why don't you rob a liquor
store, pawn your shit

40:42.358 --> 40:45.275
but get me my money at
your fucking thumbs.

40:45.277 --> 40:47.403
And why don't you tell
everyone else who owes me money

40:47.405 --> 40:49.988
that now would be a very,
very appropriate time

40:49.990 --> 40:53.492
for them to make
themselves right with me.

40:53.494 --> 40:55.619
That's a lovely home.

40:55.621 --> 40:58.081
It's your shithole, right?

40:58.083 --> 41:00.874
So where were we?

41:00.876 --> 41:02.876
This time this plan is
gonna work, I swear to God.

41:02.878 --> 41:04.628
Oh, okay, I'll bite, tell me.

41:04.630 --> 41:06.755
I can't give you specifics
but by tomorrow afternoon,

41:06.757 --> 41:09.300
I'll pay what I owe you,
I'll pay you double.

41:09.302 --> 41:10.802
Triple, I'll pay you triple.

41:10.804 --> 41:12.095
What do you have to lose?

41:12.097 --> 41:14.262
If I fuck up, you can
still kill me tomorrow.

41:14.264 --> 41:18.266
But if I'm right, 30,000
dollars is a lot of dough.

41:18.268 --> 41:20.353
It's at least worth 24 hours.

41:20.355 --> 41:22.521
Well unfortunately events
have conspired against me,

41:22.523 --> 41:25.652
now I find myself
without many options.

41:26.735 --> 41:27.818
Against my better
judgment I will give you

41:27.820 --> 41:29.820
one more chance.

41:29.822 --> 41:30.949
One more day.

41:32.032 --> 41:33.365
But if you fail,

41:33.367 --> 41:35.534
I know, fucking dynamite.

41:35.536 --> 41:36.827
Oh not only am I gonna
shove a stick of dynamite

41:36.829 --> 41:38.579
up your ass and
when you are gone,

41:38.581 --> 41:41.249
we'll break both of June's legs.

41:41.251 --> 41:43.083
And tell her it's
because you put her life

41:43.085 --> 41:44.668
up as collateral.

41:44.670 --> 41:45.587
Are we clear?

41:47.715 --> 41:49.298
We're clear.

41:49.300 --> 41:52.345
You have a lovely
evening, Carter.

41:56.391 --> 41:58.099
Not the fucking car, man!

42:35.722 --> 42:37.054
Hey Twitty, nice going, man.

42:37.056 --> 42:38.515
Who's the man?

42:43.396 --> 42:44.689
Officer Twitty?

42:46.733 --> 42:49.025
Detective Duke Johnson.

42:49.027 --> 42:50.070
Detective.

42:51.028 --> 42:53.320
Internal Affairs.

42:53.322 --> 42:54.822
Thought you were
taking the day off.

42:54.824 --> 42:59.827
Well I just came by
to get a clean uniform.

42:59.829 --> 43:02.789
Grab my SWAT gear
out of my cruiser.

43:02.791 --> 43:04.081
Got it, got it.

43:04.083 --> 43:05.874
So let me talk to
you for a moment.

43:05.876 --> 43:06.795
Uh, okay.

43:09.797 --> 43:11.715
So I read the report.

43:14.135 --> 43:19.262
Listen, is there anything
else I should know, officer?

43:19.264 --> 43:20.057
Um,

43:21.518 --> 43:22.974
Well um,

43:22.976 --> 43:24.895
those guys that I shot,

43:26.690 --> 43:30.568
had they been arrested,
would they have gone

43:31.527 --> 43:33.528
to Angola prison?

43:33.530 --> 43:34.489
Probably.

43:35.699 --> 43:37.240
What's Angola like?

43:37.242 --> 43:40.077
Oh, Angola ain't
no place to be.

43:41.371 --> 43:43.081
Know what I'm saying?

43:44.958 --> 43:46.249
Well don't worry.

43:46.251 --> 43:48.333
A good shooting is
a good shooting.

43:48.335 --> 43:49.876
We just have to
investigate, you know,

43:49.878 --> 43:52.130
a matter of procedure.

43:52.132 --> 43:55.173
Yeah so what happens now?

43:55.175 --> 43:58.385
Well, firstly I prefer you
not to shoot nobody else.

44:00.556 --> 44:01.972
I'm just kidding you man.

44:01.974 --> 44:05.559
It's just a little
Internal Affairs humor.

44:05.561 --> 44:06.978
But seriously.

44:06.980 --> 44:09.688
Don't shoot nobody else.

44:09.690 --> 44:10.524
Yes sir.

44:11.735 --> 44:14.735
Here's my card if you
think of anything else.

44:14.737 --> 44:22.325
Take care of that ear.

44:39.887 --> 44:40.887
Hey, sorry.

44:40.889 --> 44:41.804
Is it cool if I just
iron my suit real quick

44:41.806 --> 44:42.929
and get changed?

44:42.931 --> 44:44.432
Where's your car?

44:44.434 --> 44:45.766
It was running a
little hot last night

44:45.768 --> 44:48.604
so I didn't wanna
take any chances.

44:52.442 --> 44:53.983
I'm sorry, Faustus, I think
I need to change the battery

44:53.985 --> 44:55.776
on my hearing aid
because it sounded

44:55.778 --> 44:58.987
like you said Canadian dollars.

44:58.989 --> 45:00.238
Fuck you!

45:00.240 --> 45:02.157
You borrow US dollars,
I want US dollars

45:02.159 --> 45:03.700
back, you greaseball!

45:05.246 --> 45:06.954
I have another call.

45:06.956 --> 45:08.914
Please do not make me
come up to St. Louis.

45:08.916 --> 45:11.958
I hate the midwest.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.628
Hey Maury, thanks for
getting back to me.

45:13.630 --> 45:15.588
Now listen, tell the bank

45:15.590 --> 45:17.673
they are going to
get their money.

45:17.675 --> 45:19.050
I just gotta settle
up with you know who

45:19.052 --> 45:21.135
and I gotta do a couple things
you do not wanna know about

45:21.137 --> 45:24.222
so can you cover for me, baby?

45:24.224 --> 45:25.057
What?

45:26.101 --> 45:27.686
They can do that?

45:29.771 --> 45:32.646
Fuck!

45:32.648 --> 45:34.692
How much time do I have?

45:36.152 --> 45:36.985
Fuck!

45:40.532 --> 45:43.576
Fucking bankers are
worse than I am!

45:52.626 --> 45:53.918
Hey baby.

45:53.920 --> 45:56.170
What you doing in here?

45:56.172 --> 45:58.132
I was thinking, baby.

45:59.675 --> 46:01.300
Maybe we should just
tell Internal Affairs

46:01.302 --> 46:02.552
what really happened.

46:02.554 --> 46:03.970
No!

46:03.972 --> 46:07.057
No, we can't do that.

46:07.641 --> 46:09.891
This is the Lord's plan.

46:09.893 --> 46:11.226
But the Lord,

46:11.228 --> 46:14.563
You know what the
Reverend Jenks says.

46:14.565 --> 46:15.731
What?

46:15.733 --> 46:18.025
He talks to God.

46:18.027 --> 46:18.818
Really?

46:18.820 --> 46:20.028
That's right.

46:20.030 --> 46:21.487
And God told him
that it's okay to sin

46:21.489 --> 46:24.532
as long as you ask
for his forgiveness.

46:24.534 --> 46:26.450
He's starting his own church.

46:26.452 --> 46:28.577
A really cool church.

46:28.579 --> 46:30.246
I just don't wanna sin, baby.

46:30.248 --> 46:32.500
Let me show you something.

46:36.295 --> 46:38.880
You see what you're
experiencing right now?

46:38.882 --> 46:40.173
Mhmm.

46:40.175 --> 46:41.507
That's lust.

46:41.509 --> 46:43.425
And lust is a sin!

46:43.427 --> 46:44.844
But you're my wife.

46:44.846 --> 46:45.679
Exactly.

46:48.224 --> 46:50.807
If you lust after your
wife, it ain't a sin.

46:50.809 --> 46:52.769
Stealing, though a sin it may be

46:52.771 --> 46:54.103
is not a sin if
you use the money

46:54.105 --> 46:55.146
to start a church.

46:55.148 --> 46:57.398
It cancels itself out!

46:57.400 --> 46:59.860
Your conscience is clear, baby.

47:01.195 --> 47:05.491
Now, go rob that
bank for the lord.

47:06.117 --> 47:07.909
Oh.

47:07.911 --> 47:10.787
I love you.

47:10.789 --> 47:12.082
I love you too.

47:17.253 --> 47:19.961
Three different
kinds of greens?

47:19.963 --> 47:23.425
Wow, yeah green's a
very creative color.

47:24.885 --> 47:26.385
Yeah, you can draw me some grass

47:26.387 --> 47:28.554
and then an alligator.

47:28.556 --> 47:29.391
Okay.

47:30.224 --> 47:31.266
You be good.

47:32.936 --> 47:34.811
I love you.

47:34.813 --> 47:36.144
All right bye bye.

47:36.146 --> 47:36.980
Bye, baby.

47:40.068 --> 47:41.111
You ready?

47:42.112 --> 47:42.945
Yeah.

47:44.405 --> 47:47.990
Just give me two
shakes of a cocktail.

47:47.992 --> 47:50.075
You sure he's gonna
go through with it?

47:50.077 --> 47:51.452
Angola.

47:51.454 --> 47:52.872
Rock and rollah.

47:57.460 --> 48:12.097
You look good.

48:12.099 --> 48:15.059
Wow, you look professional.

48:15.061 --> 48:16.686
Let's go.

48:16.688 --> 48:20.858
Agent Scully and I gotta
interview Bigfoot later.

48:22.568 --> 48:23.402
Uh.

48:26.822 --> 48:29.157
The name
of the game is trust.

48:29.159 --> 48:30.157
Trust?

48:30.159 --> 48:31.159
First you're
gonna have trust us

48:31.161 --> 48:33.744
that this isn't our first rodeo.

48:33.746 --> 48:35.287
Second, you're a hero cop.

48:35.289 --> 48:38.499
They're gonna trust whoever
comes in with you as legit.

48:38.501 --> 48:40.001
But how
do I trust you guys?

48:40.003 --> 48:42.503
You can trust
that we want the money.

48:42.505 --> 48:46.925
If we stick to the
plan, everyone can profit.

48:48.510 --> 48:50.260
Step one,
we follow you in

48:50.262 --> 48:53.347
and you introduce
us as FBI agents.

48:53.349 --> 48:54.432
Good morning.

48:54.434 --> 48:55.724
Tell me your name.

48:55.726 --> 48:56.934
I'm Anita Turner, I'm
the bank manager here.

48:56.936 --> 48:57.934
Hi, Miss Turner.

48:57.936 --> 48:59.103
I'm Officer Jason.

48:59.105 --> 49:00.438
I know who you are.

49:00.440 --> 49:02.856
Step two, you
tell the acting bank manager

49:02.858 --> 49:04.191
that we have to
examine the vault.

49:04.193 --> 49:05.735
While that's going on,
you distract everyone

49:05.737 --> 49:08.820
by signing autographs
and shaking hands.

49:08.822 --> 49:10.322
And what about y'all?

49:10.324 --> 49:12.200
What are y'all gonna
do inside the vault?

49:12.202 --> 49:13.617
After
checking to make sure

49:13.619 --> 49:15.202
the security camera
is still disabled,

49:15.204 --> 49:16.579
Each of us will have our keys.

49:16.581 --> 49:17.414
Shit.

49:18.916 --> 49:20.708
We open the safe and
carefully switch out

49:20.710 --> 49:24.253
the decoy envelope for
the real thing and wallah,

49:24.255 --> 49:26.298
We're all rich.

49:27.717 --> 49:30.133
Well what happens
if other cops come by?

49:30.135 --> 49:31.969
We've
got that covered.

49:31.971 --> 49:34.012
What if
Commissioner Reed shows up?

49:34.014 --> 49:37.935
Trust me,
that's never gonna happen.

49:43.273 --> 49:44.856
Morning!

49:44.858 --> 49:46.818
Heard you guys had a little
trouble here yesterday.

49:46.820 --> 49:48.110
Yes we did, sir.

49:48.112 --> 49:49.445
It'd have been much
worse had we not had

49:49.447 --> 49:51.113
this brave gentleman right here.

49:51.115 --> 49:52.907
Well done, Officer.

49:52.909 --> 49:53.907
Twitty.

49:53.909 --> 49:55.534
Officer Twitty, well done.

49:55.536 --> 49:57.161
Now Miss Turner,
if you don't mind

49:57.163 --> 49:58.162
I'd like to get to my safe.

49:58.164 --> 49:59.541
- Yes sir.
- Uh.

50:02.126 --> 50:04.209
Shit!

50:04.211 --> 50:05.503
It's Commissioner Reed.

50:05.505 --> 50:07.463
Oh, Commissioner, you're
running for Governor

50:07.465 --> 50:08.630
this year, right?

50:08.632 --> 50:09.923
Uh, maybe next year son,

50:09.925 --> 50:11.467
but if you'd excuse me, please?

50:11.469 --> 50:13.385
Well, well, if I could just,

50:13.387 --> 50:15.137
Why don't you call
my office on Monday?

50:15.139 --> 50:16.179
We could always use
a good cop like you

50:16.181 --> 50:17.433
in our outfit.

50:18.809 --> 50:22.769
Just stay in
character, we'll be fine.

50:22.771 --> 50:24.104
Who are they?

50:24.106 --> 50:25.565
FBI, they
worked on the safe.

50:25.567 --> 50:26.858
Well.

50:26.860 --> 50:29.110
Thought the FBI
finished yesterday.

50:29.112 --> 50:31.070
Well we we're just,
we're looking for,

50:31.072 --> 50:33.155
Bigfoot.

50:33.157 --> 50:34.409
I mean Angola.

50:35.617 --> 50:37.284
Ervin suggests this
is the work of a ring

50:37.286 --> 50:38.952
hitting up banks
along the south.

50:38.954 --> 50:40.871
They're known as
the Bigfoot ring.

50:40.873 --> 50:42.749
The evidence indicates
that they originated

50:42.751 --> 50:44.085
in Angola prison.

50:45.128 --> 50:46.209
Hmm.

50:46.211 --> 50:47.170
That's what
I was trying to say.

50:47.172 --> 50:48.295
Did you find anything?

50:48.297 --> 50:50.257
Not yet, but we will.

50:51.175 --> 50:52.675
But you're leaving.

50:52.677 --> 50:53.967
Exactly.

50:53.969 --> 50:58.139
Nice to meet
you, commissioner.

50:58.141 --> 50:59.222
Yee hoo!

50:59.224 --> 51:01.851
What the heck is that?

51:01.853 --> 51:03.101
We've been had?

51:03.103 --> 51:05.938
Relax, Alfalfa,
they're bearer bonds.

51:05.940 --> 51:07.981
They're untraceable,
they're as good as cash.

51:07.983 --> 51:09.691
This is easily half million.

51:09.693 --> 51:12.987
Sweet Lord
Almighty, we're rich!

51:12.989 --> 51:13.780
We did it.

51:13.782 --> 51:14.824
We did it.

51:15.617 --> 51:16.451
Wow.

51:19.621 --> 51:21.162
There's photographs in here.

51:21.164 --> 51:21.954
Of what?

51:21.956 --> 51:23.121
Weird shit.

51:23.123 --> 51:25.333
Shady meetings,
politicians with hookers

51:25.335 --> 51:28.418
and fucking cocaine
and weird sex.

51:28.420 --> 51:30.253
And there's Caitlin!

51:30.255 --> 51:31.340
Oh, disgusting.

51:33.050 --> 51:34.008
What?

51:34.010 --> 51:35.553
There's a monkey.

51:48.733 --> 51:49.776
It's gone.

51:50.693 --> 51:51.900
It's all gone.

51:51.902 --> 51:52.901
What's gone?

51:52.903 --> 51:53.947
All of it!

51:57.324 --> 51:58.700
Dolores, any word from Carter?

51:58.702 --> 52:00.325
Not yet.

52:00.327 --> 52:02.327
But Peaches wants to talk to
you about Cookie Stardust.

52:02.329 --> 52:03.204
What?

52:03.206 --> 52:04.329
Why can't you deal with that?

52:04.331 --> 52:06.164
I tried but she
won't listen to me.

52:06.166 --> 52:09.251
She said you're the rabbit
and this is your hole.

52:09.253 --> 52:10.253
Takes a stripper named Peaches

52:10.255 --> 52:11.753
to sum up my life.

52:11.755 --> 52:13.257
Fine, send them in.

52:16.927 --> 52:18.552
Goddamn idiot.

52:18.554 --> 52:21.930
How many fucking times
do I have to tell them

52:21.932 --> 52:23.516
that I cannot sell
any more of these

52:23.518 --> 52:24.976
piece of shit AKs?

52:24.978 --> 52:26.309
How many fucking times?

52:26.311 --> 52:28.061
I need Glocks, goddamnit!

52:28.063 --> 52:29.771
Nine mil, or 40 cal?

52:29.773 --> 52:31.317
Stop ignoring us!

52:33.318 --> 52:35.110
Why did you need to
fire Cookie Stardust?

52:35.112 --> 52:36.403
It's not fair.

52:36.405 --> 52:38.363
Because she started to show.

52:38.365 --> 52:41.284
And nobody, nobody normal,

52:41.286 --> 52:43.369
wants to see a
pregnant stripper.

52:43.371 --> 52:45.496
Why can't she retire
like Jay Z or Eminem

52:45.498 --> 52:46.706
and come back in a year?

52:46.708 --> 52:48.041
See that's called
a sabbatical.

52:49.001 --> 52:49.835
Hold on.

52:51.211 --> 52:53.338
Albert, please do
not waste my time

52:53.340 --> 52:54.713
unless you're calling to tell me

52:54.715 --> 52:56.257
you have the money.

52:56.259 --> 52:58.342
I don't care.

52:58.344 --> 52:59.719
Hold on.

52:59.721 --> 53:02.597
Okay you see, when you leave
a job for a year or two

53:02.599 --> 53:04.766
and you come back, that
is called a sabbatical.

53:04.768 --> 53:06.224
When you leave a job
and go to Florida

53:06.226 --> 53:07.309
to play golf until you are dead,

53:07.311 --> 53:08.311
that is called retirement.

53:08.313 --> 53:09.686
There is a difference.

53:09.688 --> 53:11.438
Jay Z and Eminem do not
know that but now you do.

53:11.440 --> 53:12.440
Know what?

53:12.442 --> 53:13.733
Okay, the class is over.

53:13.735 --> 53:14.733
Get back to work.

53:14.735 --> 53:16.568
I don't care.

53:16.570 --> 53:19.155
If he doesn't have the
money, pull his gold teeth

53:19.157 --> 53:21.157
out of his fucking skull!

53:21.159 --> 53:23.242
That means she can retire
for a year and come back, yes?

53:23.244 --> 53:25.286
If you mean can she
take a sabbatical,

53:25.288 --> 53:27.996
sure whatever, get the
fuck out of my office now!

53:27.998 --> 53:29.499
All right, you heard the man.

53:29.501 --> 53:32.459
Get out there and
shake something.

53:32.461 --> 53:34.670
I don't care if you
don't have any pliers.

53:34.672 --> 53:37.382
Use a hunting
knife or a crowbar.

53:37.384 --> 53:39.967
Improvise like I taught you!

53:39.969 --> 53:41.344
Dipshit!

53:41.346 --> 53:44.012
Are you really gonna let her
just up and leave like that

53:44.014 --> 53:45.139
and then come on back?

53:45.141 --> 53:46.474
Oh please.

53:46.476 --> 53:47.557
A fortnight after I
give away her shift

53:47.559 --> 53:50.519
these girls won't even
remember the name of,

53:50.521 --> 53:52.190
Cookie Stardust?

53:53.525 --> 53:54.816
Cookie Stardust.

53:54.818 --> 53:56.025
No.

53:56.027 --> 53:58.318
Oh bless you Dolores,
you are my rock.

53:58.320 --> 54:02.030
Besides I do not have time
for stupid stripper shit now.

54:02.032 --> 54:03.324
Call Albert's cousins.

54:03.326 --> 54:04.617
See if I can unload
this shit on him.

54:04.619 --> 54:06.786
I need cash, fast.

54:06.788 --> 54:08.996
Oh, also, the ice
machine is broken again.

54:08.998 --> 54:10.789
You need to make three
more cases of Jack Daniels

54:10.791 --> 54:12.416
fall off the back of a truck.

54:12.418 --> 54:13.418
And the men's bathroom
has gone down.

54:14.461 --> 54:15.336
That's Reed.

54:15.338 --> 54:17.130
Of course it is.

54:17.132 --> 54:17.965
Get out.

54:19.509 --> 54:20.800
Hold please.

54:20.802 --> 54:22.300
How dare
you put me on hold,

54:22.302 --> 54:23.762
you cock sucker!

54:24.889 --> 54:26.264
Oh relax, your
money's on its way.

54:26.266 --> 54:27.889
That's not what
I'm calling about

54:27.891 --> 54:29.684
you bedazzled fuck.

54:29.686 --> 54:33.354
I just lost something
much more important.

54:33.356 --> 54:38.693
Go on.

54:38.695 --> 54:40.278
Who's the dude with a bike

54:40.280 --> 54:42.112
who just looked like he
just fucked a light socket?

54:42.114 --> 54:43.905
Oh that, that's
Reverend Lucas Jenks.

54:43.907 --> 54:45.657
He's our personal pastor.

54:45.659 --> 54:47.534
He's starting a
church for sinners.

54:47.536 --> 54:51.204
He's come
to the right place.

54:51.206 --> 54:52.206
Amen.

54:52.208 --> 54:53.458
Ah, yes!

54:53.460 --> 54:55.793
Woo!

54:55.795 --> 54:56.628
Yes!

54:57.880 --> 54:59.338
Check it out, good as cash.

54:59.340 --> 55:00.715
Well congrats, man.

55:00.717 --> 55:01.632
You're rich and you're not
gonna get raped to death

55:01.634 --> 55:03.133
in Angola, so that's a win.

55:03.135 --> 55:06.512
Well this
money isn't for us.

55:06.514 --> 55:07.929
It's for the Lord.

55:07.931 --> 55:09.474
That's right.

55:09.476 --> 55:11.184
Mhmm.

55:11.186 --> 55:12.851
All right.

55:12.853 --> 55:15.105
Some cocky piece of shit

55:16.358 --> 55:20.818
goddamn redneck had the
gall to clean out my safe!

55:20.820 --> 55:23.070
And you will be
calling me why?

55:23.072 --> 55:25.197
You're going to find them

55:25.199 --> 55:27.325
and you're going to
exact retribution

55:27.327 --> 55:29.242
on my behalf.

55:29.244 --> 55:30.369
Well if they're
local I can find them

55:30.371 --> 55:31.662
but what's in it for me?

55:31.664 --> 55:33.331
Fuck you!

55:33.333 --> 55:34.749
You get to stay in business,
that's what's in it for you.

55:34.751 --> 55:36.833
Okay then, 10 percent
of whatever I recover

55:36.835 --> 55:39.086
would be fine,
thank you so much.

55:39.088 --> 55:40.545
You are such a giver.

55:40.547 --> 55:43.090
Sucking dick make
you deaf, boy, huh?

55:43.092 --> 55:44.594
I said fuck and you!

55:45.762 --> 55:46.596
Really?

55:47.722 --> 55:50.767
15 percent, why you
are so generous.

55:52.811 --> 55:53.937
15 percent.

55:54.938 --> 55:56.229
But listen here.

55:56.231 --> 55:57.604
There are photos in
that envelope too.

55:57.606 --> 55:59.481
Ooh, what kind of photos?

55:59.483 --> 56:01.400
Let's just say if
those photos go wide,

56:01.402 --> 56:02.985
we both go to jail.

56:02.987 --> 56:06.197
Boy, you fuck me.

56:06.199 --> 56:08.950
So help me god, I
will ram a SWAT team

56:08.952 --> 56:11.577
so far up that hole of yours

56:11.579 --> 56:14.207
you will spit cop!

56:14.581 --> 56:16.416
You do have a way with words.

56:16.418 --> 56:19.001
I'll call you when
I know something.

56:19.003 --> 56:19.837
Dolores!

56:23.132 --> 56:24.798
Okay, this is what we do.

56:24.800 --> 56:27.427
I want guys on the
street asking questions.

56:27.429 --> 56:28.260
And Gill?

56:28.262 --> 56:29.637
Yeah.

56:29.639 --> 56:32.264
I want you to follow
that cop Twitty everywhere.

56:32.266 --> 56:34.391
Consider it done.

56:34.393 --> 56:37.478
Who's handling
the investigation?

56:37.480 --> 56:40.231
I believe
Detective Johnson is.

56:40.233 --> 56:41.443
Johnson, shit.

56:42.568 --> 56:46.278
Motherfucker's been
dying to put me in jail.

56:46.280 --> 56:47.320
Someone stole
the bonds from Reed

56:47.322 --> 56:48.613
that I was gonna steal.

56:48.615 --> 56:49.949
Turns out, Reed was
keeping something else

56:49.951 --> 56:51.784
in that safety deposit box.

56:51.786 --> 56:54.746
That little bitch Caitlin
must have been planning

56:54.748 --> 56:57.581
on double-crossing
me this whole time.

56:57.583 --> 57:00.459
Still, it had to be
a two person job.

57:00.461 --> 57:02.838
Dirty business, stealing.

57:07.177 --> 57:08.260
Well,

57:10.637 --> 57:14.097
can't convert the
bonds till tomorrow.

57:14.099 --> 57:17.519
There's really nothing
left to do tonight.

57:19.105 --> 57:20.523
What do you think?

57:24.568 --> 57:25.610
Hootenanny?

57:25.612 --> 57:27.487
Hootenanny.

57:42.920 --> 57:46.546
♪ I wanna go where my
country girl goes ♪

57:46.548 --> 57:50.677
♪ Like where my
green grasses grow ♪

57:50.679 --> 57:54.012
♪ I feel at ease with
my country girl, yeah ♪

57:54.014 --> 57:58.141
♪ She knows how to groove me ♪

57:58.143 --> 58:01.938
♪ I'll take you back
bout a year before ♪

58:01.940 --> 58:04.731
♪ She's on earth ♪

58:56.119 --> 58:58.327
What if I told
you I was pregnant?

59:01.498 --> 59:06.543
That's a little fast, you
know, biologically speaking.

59:06.545 --> 59:08.255
Just testing you.

59:10.132 --> 59:12.758
I was never very
good at tests.

59:12.760 --> 59:14.635
But you're very clever.

59:16.972 --> 59:18.639
You'd be a great father.

59:18.641 --> 59:20.057
Oh, come on.

59:20.059 --> 59:21.059
What?

59:21.061 --> 59:22.392
That's crazy.

59:22.394 --> 59:23.978
You're so good with Ethan.

59:23.980 --> 59:26.688
He's a great kid.

59:26.690 --> 59:28.273
I'm nobody's father.

59:28.275 --> 59:30.485
I don't even know what
the fuck that word means.

59:30.487 --> 59:32.113
I never knew my dad.

59:34.699 --> 59:38.492
I'm in love with you.

59:38.494 --> 59:40.619
And I love Ethan.

59:40.621 --> 59:41.871
And when I see
you guys together,

59:41.873 --> 59:44.250
it's fucking, it's amazing.

59:46.795 --> 59:48.920
No kid should have me as a dad,

59:48.922 --> 59:50.173
it's not fair.

59:56.096 --> 59:56.929
Yeah.

01:00:02.476 --> 01:00:04.769
We need the
rest of the bonds.

01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:07.646
For the Lord is good.

01:00:07.648 --> 01:00:09.358
And his love endures.

01:00:11.152 --> 01:00:16.238
Psalm Chapter 100 verse five.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.782
We already have
100,000 dollars.

01:00:18.784 --> 01:00:20.659
I mean isn't that enough
to start a church?

01:00:20.661 --> 01:00:22.704
Of course, I think it is.

01:00:22.706 --> 01:00:24.956
But this ain't me
talking, Brother Jason.

01:00:24.958 --> 01:00:27.541
It's the Lord telling
me what's what

01:00:27.543 --> 01:00:30.128
and all I'm doing is
passing along the word.

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:31.753
Think about it
this way, honey baby.

01:00:31.755 --> 01:00:33.673
They're bad people.

01:00:33.675 --> 01:00:35.800
And they're gonna do bad
things with that money.

01:00:35.802 --> 01:00:36.925
They are.

01:00:36.927 --> 01:00:37.969
We're gonna use
that money for good.

01:00:37.971 --> 01:00:39.012
We will.

01:00:39.014 --> 01:00:39.847
Mhmm.

01:00:40.764 --> 01:00:42.224
Brother Jason?

01:00:44.768 --> 01:00:46.562
The Lord needs you.

01:00:48.063 --> 01:00:51.065
He needs you to go
get that there money

01:00:51.067 --> 01:00:54.028
so that we can
build us a hot damn,

01:00:54.862 --> 01:00:58.780
forgive me Lord, awesome church.

01:00:58.782 --> 01:01:00.076
That's right.

01:01:59.802 --> 01:02:01.719
Ain't no
way an honest cop

01:02:01.721 --> 01:02:09.519
can have a wife that hot.

01:02:09.521 --> 01:02:10.647
Hey Carter?

01:02:14.858 --> 01:02:34.918
Carter?

01:02:38.465 --> 01:02:41.175
Only you would forget
your keys after leaving.

01:02:41.177 --> 01:02:42.677
Whoah.

01:02:42.679 --> 01:02:43.845
Where's Carter?

01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:45.012
What the fuck are you doing?

01:02:45.014 --> 01:02:46.222
The Lord's spoken, June.

01:02:46.224 --> 01:02:48.016
We need the rest of that
money for our church.

01:02:48.018 --> 01:02:49.307
What?

01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:50.351
You're trying to
steal money I need

01:02:50.353 --> 01:02:52.811
to get my son back for Jesus?

01:02:52.813 --> 01:02:53.896
Don't listen to her lies.

01:02:53.898 --> 01:02:55.023
I'm not lying.

01:02:55.025 --> 01:02:57.441
This is important, June.

01:02:57.443 --> 01:02:58.570
God told him!

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:04.990
What am I supposed to do?

01:03:04.992 --> 01:03:06.284
Wait.

01:03:06.286 --> 01:03:07.200
Hey, what are you
doing, what are you doing?

01:03:07.202 --> 01:03:10.412
I'm just turning on the light.

01:03:10.414 --> 01:03:11.706
Turn yourself in.

01:03:11.708 --> 01:03:14.291
Confess that you shot the girl.

01:03:14.293 --> 01:03:17.338
Go to jail and pray
for forgiveness.

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.592
The Lord don't
want him to pray.

01:03:22.594 --> 01:03:24.885
He wants the cash!

01:03:24.887 --> 01:03:26.512
And I don't want to
have to hurt you, darling.

01:03:26.514 --> 01:03:28.932
But those bonds belong to God.

01:03:30.018 --> 01:03:32.101
Now give them to me!

01:03:32.103 --> 01:03:33.811
Give me the money, June!

01:03:33.813 --> 01:03:35.688
It belongs to the Lord now!

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:37.690
Okay, okay.

01:03:37.692 --> 01:03:39.735
Over there, you asshole.

01:03:42.322 --> 01:03:43.487
I'm rich!

01:03:43.489 --> 01:03:45.199
I mean Jesus is rich!

01:03:46.784 --> 01:03:48.659
You are taking
the only hope I have

01:03:48.661 --> 01:03:50.244
of getting my son
back because your wife

01:03:50.246 --> 01:03:52.287
and this fucking bullshitter

01:03:52.289 --> 01:03:53.331
told you to.

01:03:53.333 --> 01:03:55.374
This is wrong, you know that.

01:03:55.376 --> 01:03:57.918
The Lord will anoint
you with everlasting life.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.461
What does that mean?

01:03:59.463 --> 01:04:00.796
Where's Carter?

01:04:00.798 --> 01:04:02.005
I don't fucking
know, he's gone.

01:04:02.007 --> 01:04:03.007
He's gone?

01:04:03.009 --> 01:04:04.717
You guys are literally
the stupidest people

01:04:04.719 --> 01:04:07.887
I've ever fucking met
and I'm from Oklahoma.

01:04:07.889 --> 01:04:09.722
I got it, I got it.

01:04:09.724 --> 01:04:13.141
You just tell Carter he
better not follow us.

01:04:13.143 --> 01:04:15.561
This money belongs to God now.

01:04:15.563 --> 01:04:16.854
Amen.

01:04:16.856 --> 01:04:18.063
Whoah, whoah.

01:04:18.065 --> 01:04:18.856
Oh shit!

01:04:38.128 --> 01:04:40.086
Hey, I'm an
officer of the law.

01:04:40.088 --> 01:04:41.295
You're all under arrest.

01:04:41.297 --> 01:04:42.796
One more word out of you,

01:04:42.798 --> 01:04:44.257
you're gonna be just
another dead dirty NOLA cop,

01:04:44.259 --> 01:04:45.800
do you understand me fucktard?

01:04:45.802 --> 01:04:47.175
Yes or no?

01:04:47.177 --> 01:04:49.302
I got this one trying
to run out the back, boss.

01:04:49.304 --> 01:04:51.097
You're Spencer Rabbit.

01:04:51.099 --> 01:04:52.139
Yeah, no shit.

01:04:52.141 --> 01:04:56.059
Mr. Rabbit, my name
is Reverend Lucas Jenks.

01:04:56.061 --> 01:04:57.103
Perhaps you heard of me.

01:04:57.105 --> 01:04:59.563
You are the talk of
the town, Reverend.

01:04:59.565 --> 01:05:02.109
Hey, that's not yours.

01:05:05.155 --> 01:05:06.653
All right, little girl.

01:05:06.655 --> 01:05:07.780
Where are the photos?

01:05:07.782 --> 01:05:09.032
What photos?

01:05:09.034 --> 01:05:11.075
The photos that are
supposed to be with the bonds,

01:05:11.077 --> 01:05:12.409
don't be a shithead!

01:05:12.411 --> 01:05:14.996
I don't know, maybe
Carter has them.

01:05:14.998 --> 01:05:18.833
All right, well where
the fuck is Carter?

01:05:18.835 --> 01:05:23.086
Baby girl, you have officially
gotten on my last nerve.

01:05:23.088 --> 01:05:25.923
Let's all move this melodrama
down to the hole, shall we?

01:05:25.925 --> 01:05:26.965
Come on!

01:05:26.967 --> 01:05:28.425
Mr. Rabbit,
I'd like to talk to you

01:05:28.427 --> 01:05:30.887
about a business
proposition for the Lord.

01:05:30.889 --> 01:05:32.554
How about setting up a
church down in either uptown

01:05:32.556 --> 01:05:34.139
or in the bywater.

01:05:34.141 --> 01:05:36.141
And now, there's some
circumstances that I'd like

01:05:36.143 --> 01:05:37.517
- to talk to you about.
- Oh shit.

01:05:37.519 --> 01:05:39.771
I have good news, I am
in possession of the bonds

01:05:39.773 --> 01:05:41.188
and the photos.

01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:44.608
However, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to restructure our deal.

01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:47.612
Boy, if you fuck me,

01:05:47.614 --> 01:05:50.822
It's going to go
something like this.

01:05:50.824 --> 01:05:52.575
In addition to the 15
percent of the bonds,

01:05:52.577 --> 01:05:54.327
I'm gonna stop paying
you to move my shit

01:05:54.329 --> 01:05:55.577
through your pores.

01:05:55.579 --> 01:05:56.996
And you are personally
going to see to it

01:05:56.998 --> 01:05:58.456
that all my permits go through.

01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:01.166
It is either that or
these photos go wide.

01:06:01.168 --> 01:06:07.048
Fuck you very much.

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:08.383
You don't have the photos.

01:06:08.385 --> 01:06:10.258
Oh it's classic power
play, my dear Pepper.

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.510
Don't call me that.

01:06:11.512 --> 01:06:12.845
I have proprietary value,

01:06:12.847 --> 01:06:14.012
it'll be as worth as the photos.

01:06:14.014 --> 01:06:15.430
You, my dear sweet girl.

01:06:15.432 --> 01:06:17.268
Get in the car, bitch.

01:06:19.521 --> 01:06:20.355
Gill.

01:06:21.523 --> 01:06:23.483
Where the fuck are you?

01:06:26.193 --> 01:06:29.822
I know Spencer Rabbit's
involved, you moron.

01:06:35.036 --> 01:06:37.994
Get whatever you need but I
need you to do this cleanly.

01:06:37.996 --> 01:06:40.164
This cannot be connected to me.

01:06:40.166 --> 01:06:42.208
Shoot!

01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:43.043
Okay.

01:06:44.045 --> 01:06:46.503
Lord, give me a sign.

01:06:46.505 --> 01:06:52.260
What should I do?

01:06:52.262 --> 01:07:01.226
Fuck!

01:07:01.228 --> 01:07:02.394
Oh!

01:07:02.396 --> 01:07:03.856
Mysterious ways!

01:07:06.192 --> 01:07:08.066
Commissioner, we're here.

01:07:08.068 --> 01:07:10.778
Remember, bonds are important.

01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:14.907
But the most important
thing are the photos.

01:07:14.909 --> 01:07:16.825
You do what you have to do

01:07:16.827 --> 01:07:18.827
but we can't have witnesses.

01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:21.998
Once you know the photos are
on site, eliminate everyone.

01:07:38.849 --> 01:07:39.683
June?

01:07:44.981 --> 01:07:45.815
June?!

01:07:47.858 --> 01:07:48.900
June!

01:07:48.902 --> 01:07:51.276
They're gone!

01:07:51.278 --> 01:07:54.780
Gone!

01:07:54.782 --> 01:07:56.907
Spencer took them.

01:07:56.909 --> 01:08:15.885
He left a note.

01:08:20.475 --> 01:08:22.183
Spencer Rabbit,
how may I help you?

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:23.308
Spencer, it's Carter.

01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:24.393
Oh good evening, Carter.

01:08:24.395 --> 01:08:25.394
I'll cut to the chase.

01:08:25.395 --> 01:08:26.437
I assume you have the photos.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:27.688
What photos?

01:08:27.689 --> 01:08:29.649
I am not in the mood.

01:08:32.112 --> 01:08:33.652
Good.

01:08:33.654 --> 01:08:35.737
I give you June, you
give me the photos.

01:08:35.738 --> 01:08:37.157
Do we have a deal?

01:08:39.786 --> 01:08:42.953
Listen, I want the cop
and the douchebag too.

01:08:42.956 --> 01:08:44.913
I'm sorry, is this the
saint Carter Jennings?

01:08:44.916 --> 01:08:46.456
He's an honest cop, Spencer.

01:08:46.457 --> 01:08:47.375
I got him into it.

01:08:47.377 --> 01:08:48.667
Eh.

01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:50.044
Hey look, just promise
me you won't kill him

01:08:50.046 --> 01:08:51.294
until I get there, yeah?

01:08:51.296 --> 01:08:53.798
Okay, I tell you what.

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.761
I promise you I
won't kill the cop.

01:09:07.188 --> 01:09:08.520
Fuck!

01:09:13.694 --> 01:09:15.194
Every fucking time.

01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:17.448
Jesus fuck.

01:09:29.002 --> 01:09:31.001
Pepper, Pepper, Pepper.

01:09:31.002 --> 01:09:32.294
I always thought
you were too smart

01:09:32.296 --> 01:09:34.004
to be a stripper, but
apparently you are too dumb

01:09:34.006 --> 01:09:36.381
to be anything else.

01:09:36.384 --> 01:09:38.175
This is all your
fault, you realize.

01:09:38.176 --> 01:09:39.301
Excuse me, Mr. Rabbit.

01:09:39.304 --> 01:09:41.386
To finish what I was
saying, the Lord's...

01:09:41.389 --> 01:09:42.971
I hear those words
come out of your mouth

01:09:42.974 --> 01:09:46.600
one more time, I'm gonna
bash your fucking skull in.

01:09:46.603 --> 01:09:47.393
Whoah, whoah, whoah.

01:09:47.395 --> 01:09:48.435
Take it.

01:09:48.438 --> 01:09:49.227
Okay.

01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:50.354
You need a gun.

01:09:50.356 --> 01:09:51.397
Thank you, thanks Darla.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:53.607
I just, I'm not
really a gun guy.

01:09:53.609 --> 01:09:54.402
Fine.

01:10:04.537 --> 01:10:08.915
So you think that just by
giving Spencer the envelope

01:10:08.917 --> 01:10:11.250
and hoping that he gives
us our people back,

01:10:11.252 --> 01:10:13.335
that is our best option?

01:10:13.337 --> 01:10:14.505
I do, yeah.

01:10:15.381 --> 01:10:17.089
Spencer's a businessman.

01:10:17.091 --> 01:10:19.258
I know the Lord packs
a lot of firepower

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:22.303
but you and me going
in there with nothing

01:10:22.305 --> 01:10:26.351
but a gun and my
smile, it's suicide.

01:10:27.851 --> 01:10:29.309
Would you die to save June?

01:10:29.311 --> 01:10:30.769
Well if I don't have to, why...

01:10:30.771 --> 01:10:32.562
Would you die to save June?!

01:10:32.564 --> 01:10:34.773
Yes, yes, yes, I would!

01:10:34.775 --> 01:10:36.358
Absolutely!

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.945
If I had to, yes!

01:10:45.286 --> 01:10:46.121
Fine.

01:10:47.913 --> 01:10:50.498
We'll try it your way.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:55.419
But if he doesn't give us what
he swore by God to give us,

01:10:55.421 --> 01:10:57.921
we're gonna take him back.

01:10:57.923 --> 01:11:02.386
Darla would you point the
gun someplace else, please?

01:11:06.975 --> 01:11:09.642
Spencer, we go
way too far back.

01:11:09.644 --> 01:11:11.436
My credit with you is good.

01:11:11.438 --> 01:11:14.772
Oh my sweet girl, how do
I make you understand this?

01:11:14.774 --> 01:11:16.315
You know in the movies

01:11:16.317 --> 01:11:17.607
when some asshole
starts talking about

01:11:17.609 --> 01:11:21.320
the first time they kill
someone and how it felt so wrong

01:11:21.322 --> 01:11:23.031
and you never forget
your first kill

01:11:23.033 --> 01:11:26.075
and all that sort of bullshit?

01:11:26.077 --> 01:11:28.326
It's not the case with me.

01:11:28.328 --> 01:11:29.579
The only thing I remember
from my first time

01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:31.455
is I got paid 500
dollars to do it

01:11:31.457 --> 01:11:32.874
and I got pissed off 'cause
the motherfucker bled

01:11:32.876 --> 01:11:34.459
all over my Levi's jacket

01:11:34.461 --> 01:11:35.625
and I had to throw it out.

01:11:35.627 --> 01:11:37.128
Pappy Melbourn used
to send me out,

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:38.338
it's long before your time.

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:40.673
He used to just
write down a name,

01:11:40.675 --> 01:11:42.592
hand the money to
one of the other boys

01:11:42.594 --> 01:11:47.472
and say into the thin air,
send the faggot with the knife.

01:11:47.474 --> 01:11:48.638
If he didn't want
somebody dead he'd say

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:53.393
send the faggot with a hammer.

01:11:53.395 --> 01:11:54.437
I'd be standing right there,

01:11:54.439 --> 01:11:56.688
he never once spoke
directly to me.

01:11:56.690 --> 01:11:59.358
Apparently I made
him uncomfortable.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:03.446
But he sure as fuck
appreciated my work ethic.

01:12:03.448 --> 01:12:05.781
So yes, Pepper, we have
known each other a long time

01:12:05.783 --> 01:12:08.534
and the truth is I do like you.

01:12:08.536 --> 01:12:09.744
So please hear me.

01:12:09.746 --> 01:12:12.287
And it's gonna
sound like a cliche

01:12:12.289 --> 01:12:15.458
but remember cliches
exist for a reason.

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.501
It's not personal.

01:12:17.503 --> 01:12:19.336
It is just business.

01:12:19.338 --> 01:12:20.420
Business?

01:12:20.422 --> 01:12:21.839
You can't do this!

01:12:21.841 --> 01:12:22.839
I am a police officer!

01:12:23.635 --> 01:12:25.259
Now, Mr. Rabbit.

01:12:25.261 --> 01:12:27.178
You're a businessman.

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.054
And as a businessman
I am telling you

01:12:29.056 --> 01:12:30.555
this is a great
opportunity for you

01:12:30.557 --> 01:12:33.934
to make some real money
and find forgiveness.

01:12:33.936 --> 01:12:36.521
I'm telling you,
it's a cool church.

01:12:36.523 --> 01:12:39.482
The Lord forgives,
Brother Spencer.

01:12:39.484 --> 01:12:40.942
Even someone like
you might find...

01:12:48.118 --> 01:12:49.866
Well now, I did warn him.

01:12:49.868 --> 01:12:53.204
Oh shit, that's
not gonna come out.

01:12:53.206 --> 01:12:54.955
Darla, stay with me.

01:12:54.957 --> 01:12:56.624
It's gonna be fine,
Jason is okay.

01:13:21.693 --> 01:13:22.652
Goddamnit!

01:13:26.322 --> 01:13:28.406
Oh shit, I just
bought this suit.

01:13:28.408 --> 01:13:30.243
Hello, Nancy.

01:13:33.747 --> 01:13:36.164
Is that supposed to
be some type of slur?

01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:39.711
The Commissioner
needs his files tonight.

01:13:45.675 --> 01:13:48.593
And I looked, and
behold was a pale horse.

01:13:48.595 --> 01:13:51.637
And his name as sought
on him was Death.

01:13:51.639 --> 01:13:53.097
And hell followed with him.

01:13:53.099 --> 01:13:56.683
And the power that was
given unto them was to kill

01:13:56.685 --> 01:13:57.977
with the sword.

01:13:57.979 --> 01:13:59.689
What are you doing?

01:14:01.565 --> 01:14:03.273
He asked for my help
retrieving his property

01:14:03.275 --> 01:14:04.942
and then he sends his
goons to shake me down.

01:14:04.944 --> 01:14:06.943
I'm getting so
sick of this shit.

01:14:06.945 --> 01:14:08.321
Shut your goddamn
mouth, faggot!

01:14:10.324 --> 01:14:13.534
I do not like that word!

01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:33.929
Take that!

01:15:03.461 --> 01:15:04.585
Don't do this.

01:15:04.587 --> 01:15:06.461
I'm sorry, Jason.

01:15:06.463 --> 01:15:07.548
Oh shh.

01:15:10.342 --> 01:15:13.179
I'm gonna start
that church, okay?

01:15:15.097 --> 01:15:17.934
You're a good
man, Jason Twitty.

01:15:18.976 --> 01:15:19.894
I love you.

01:15:20.936 --> 01:15:22.689
I love you.

01:15:30.279 --> 01:15:31.320
Make a run for it, boss.

01:15:31.322 --> 01:15:32.612
I'll cover you.

01:15:32.614 --> 01:15:36.327
How do you even know
that thing's gonna work?

01:15:52.217 --> 01:15:53.425
Ah shit!

01:16:02.103 --> 01:16:03.769
Give me the files!

01:16:03.771 --> 01:16:05.354
Wait, okay, okay, okay!

01:16:05.356 --> 01:16:07.565
Give me the fucking files!

01:16:07.567 --> 01:16:08.775
Spencer, let's talk.

01:16:08.777 --> 01:16:11.777
Don't fucking fuck with me.

01:16:11.779 --> 01:16:12.613
Freeze!

01:16:13.489 --> 01:16:15.781
Drop the weapon, Spencer.

01:16:15.783 --> 01:16:17.325
Drop it now!

01:16:17.327 --> 01:16:18.161
Fuck!

01:16:19.119 --> 01:16:20.202
That's evidence.

01:16:20.204 --> 01:16:21.954
Put that in the bag.

01:16:21.956 --> 01:16:25.458
I'm gonna do what I should
have done from the start.

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:26.293
You.

01:16:27.753 --> 01:16:30.921
I am not a dirty cop!

01:16:30.923 --> 01:16:32.214
Listen officer,
surely we can come

01:16:32.216 --> 01:16:33.132
to some sort of agreement.

01:16:39.932 --> 01:16:41.391
Baby.

01:16:41.393 --> 01:16:43.518
Don't, don't, don't
fucking touch me.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.309
Hey!

01:16:44.311 --> 01:16:46.062
Fuck you, Carter!

01:16:46.064 --> 01:16:48.313
I'm sorry, okay?

01:16:48.315 --> 01:16:49.941
I can't believe I
fell for it again.

01:16:49.943 --> 01:16:51.692
Hey, what's going on?

01:16:51.694 --> 01:16:53.820
You left me, what's going on.

01:16:53.822 --> 01:16:54.653
What are you talking
about, I didn't leave you,

01:16:54.655 --> 01:16:55.821
no I didn't.

01:16:55.823 --> 01:16:56.906
I woke up and you were gone!

01:16:56.908 --> 01:16:58.782
I went to go make
copies of the photos

01:16:58.784 --> 01:16:59.701
so that we could
have some leverage

01:16:59.703 --> 01:17:00.785
in case the shit hit the fan.

01:17:00.787 --> 01:17:01.827
You left a note.

01:17:01.829 --> 01:17:03.245
I left a statement.

01:17:03.247 --> 01:17:04.705
It was a goodbye note, Carter.

01:17:04.707 --> 01:17:06.750
It didn't say goodbye.

01:17:10.796 --> 01:17:13.046
It said I don't deserve you.

01:17:13.048 --> 01:17:14.799
Because I don't.

01:17:14.801 --> 01:17:18.385
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:17:18.387 --> 01:17:20.722
I know I fucked up in the past.

01:17:20.724 --> 01:17:23.223
I've been an idiot.

01:17:23.225 --> 01:17:25.394
It'll never happen again.

01:17:27.146 --> 01:17:30.815
You were really willing
to take a bullet for me?

01:17:30.817 --> 01:17:33.360
I'd have taken all of them.

01:17:35.529 --> 01:17:36.363
Fuck.

01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:39.574
When this trunk opens,
you get behind me

01:17:39.576 --> 01:17:42.367
and you stay there, okay?

01:17:42.369 --> 01:17:43.328
I love you.

01:17:44.288 --> 01:17:45.122
I,

01:17:45.957 --> 01:17:46.875
I love you.

01:17:51.296 --> 01:17:52.919
Detective Johnson?

01:17:52.921 --> 01:17:54.714
No, it's your
guardian fucking angel.

01:17:54.716 --> 01:17:56.089
Get your ass out of
that trunk, come on.

01:17:56.091 --> 01:17:56.925
Come on.

01:17:58.845 --> 01:18:01.888
You too.

01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:04.807
So, uh, I get a call
from Officer Twitty

01:18:04.809 --> 01:18:06.808
saying that he want
to turn himself in

01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:08.352
for the murder of
Caitlin Jackson

01:18:08.354 --> 01:18:10.312
and for aiding in
a bank robbery.

01:18:10.314 --> 01:18:11.897
I can explain that.

01:18:11.899 --> 01:18:13.816
I thought you were gonna
call me when the job was done.

01:18:13.818 --> 01:18:15.067
I mean that was the deal, right?

01:18:15.069 --> 01:18:16.361
Yeah, no I was.

01:18:16.363 --> 01:18:17.861
But I was, you know, I
was a little jammed up,

01:18:17.863 --> 01:18:19.988
If you know, why
haven't you arrested him?

01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:21.156
He's a criminal.

01:18:21.158 --> 01:18:22.618
Quiet, Junior.

01:18:23.787 --> 01:18:25.410
What about your oath?

01:18:25.412 --> 01:18:26.745
What about justice?

01:18:26.747 --> 01:18:28.332
Justice?

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.585
What's that?

01:18:32.587 --> 01:18:34.253
Drop gun.

01:18:34.255 --> 01:18:36.339
Don't have no serial numbers.

01:18:36.341 --> 01:18:38.132
And what's in that
bag is gonna help me

01:18:38.134 --> 01:18:41.009
be police superintendent.

01:18:41.011 --> 01:18:45.848
So you can exercise justice
right here, right now.

01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:47.141
Wait, wait, wait.

01:18:47.143 --> 01:18:49.227
We have a deal, I
got you Reed's files.

01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:50.602
That's murder.

01:18:50.604 --> 01:18:52.062
Do you have any
idea how many people

01:18:52.064 --> 01:18:54.232
this devil has killed?

01:18:54.234 --> 01:18:55.316
Shit people ain't
gonna be surprised

01:18:55.318 --> 01:18:56.983
if he turns up dead.

01:18:56.985 --> 01:18:59.403
Shit, you might even be a hero.

01:18:59.405 --> 01:19:02.865
And these two, a dead
thief and a dead stripper,

01:19:02.867 --> 01:19:05.410
shit, ain't nobody
gonna miss them.

01:19:05.412 --> 01:19:07.995
Three less things we
gotta worry about.

01:19:07.997 --> 01:19:10.205
Jason, Jason, come on.

01:19:10.207 --> 01:19:12.709
Fuck three less
things we gotta worry about.

01:19:12.711 --> 01:19:15.003
Oh fuck that,
this isn't funny!

01:19:15.005 --> 01:19:15.878
Do it.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:16.715
Jason.

01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:21.925
Come on, do it!

01:19:21.927 --> 01:19:23.928
Boy please.

01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:25.804
Your casefile's sitting
on top of my desk.

01:19:25.806 --> 01:19:27.055
I end up with a bullet
hole in my head,

01:19:27.057 --> 01:19:30.395
guess who they're
gonna look for first?

01:19:37.359 --> 01:19:40.193
Well stop being such a
little bitch and just do it.

01:19:40.195 --> 01:19:42.448
Not the face, you asshole.

01:19:52.625 --> 01:19:53.790
Good to know a little coaxing

01:19:53.792 --> 01:19:56.211
will do what needs to be done.

01:19:58.088 --> 01:20:00.130
I don't know how I feel.

01:20:00.132 --> 01:20:03.092
You did good,
kid, you did good.

01:20:03.094 --> 01:20:05.010
Mr. Rabbit, witnesses
will testify

01:20:05.012 --> 01:20:06.888
that you were nowhere
near the Rabbit Hole

01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:09.473
when that shit went down.

01:20:09.475 --> 01:20:11.768
And after Commissioner
Reed goes to jail,

01:20:11.770 --> 01:20:16.104
you're gonna pay 10 Gs a
month to my new protege.

01:20:16.106 --> 01:20:17.940
Wait.

01:20:17.942 --> 01:20:21.777
He'll take his cut
and give me the rest.

01:20:21.779 --> 01:20:24.071
Oh isn't that the
story of my fucking life?

01:20:24.073 --> 01:20:25.365
What about us?

01:20:25.367 --> 01:20:26.782
That deal we made in
the coroner's office

01:20:26.784 --> 01:20:28.701
still stands, Mr. Jennings.

01:20:28.703 --> 01:20:31.036
You're free to go.

01:20:31.038 --> 01:20:33.623
All right Junior, let's roll.

01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:35.958
You need some rest,

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:38.253
and I got a coverup to stage.

01:20:40.047 --> 01:20:43.715
Take care of that fool.

01:20:43.717 --> 01:20:45.135
Have a good night.

01:20:47.930 --> 01:21:09.366
Come on.

01:21:09.368 --> 01:21:10.576
Carter, be a dear
and come unlock these

01:21:10.578 --> 01:21:12.120
so I can kill this motherfucker.

01:21:12.122 --> 01:21:13.079
Listen, I'm sorry.

01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:15.039
Oh, you are sorry?

01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:17.875
I am, I'm sorry
about everything.

01:21:17.877 --> 01:21:21.211
I just, I did what I had
to do, you understand.

01:21:21.213 --> 01:21:22.047
Hmm.

01:21:23.216 --> 01:21:27.384
Oh fuck, oh look,
I owe you 30K, right?

01:21:27.386 --> 01:21:29.430
How about I give you 50,

01:21:30.222 --> 01:21:32.559
and yeah, we call it a day?

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:36.977
Well.

01:21:36.979 --> 01:21:39.938
Well 50 does sound wonderful,

01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:42.107
how's about this instead?

01:21:42.109 --> 01:21:45.402
You keep the 50,
give me the rest

01:21:45.404 --> 01:21:49.367
and I never see either
one of your faces again?

01:21:50.534 --> 01:21:51.701
It's that or I
take all the money

01:21:51.703 --> 01:21:53.160
and slit both your throats.

01:21:53.162 --> 01:21:55.245
You're handcuffed
and bleeding.

01:21:55.247 --> 01:21:56.707
Choose wisely.

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:22.732
You are smarter than you look.

01:22:22.734 --> 01:22:24.107
You son of a bitch.

01:22:29.865 --> 01:22:30.990
You are such an asshole.

01:22:30.992 --> 01:22:32.991
It's gonna take you
a minute to find those.

01:22:32.993 --> 01:22:35.244
But when you do, you
can unlock yourself,

01:22:35.246 --> 01:22:38.289
drive yourself home.

01:22:38.291 --> 01:22:39.542
Happy hunting.

01:22:41.043 --> 01:22:42.794
What's the matter?

01:22:42.796 --> 01:22:45.671
You ever heard of
honor among thieves?

01:22:45.673 --> 01:22:47.801
You fucking swamp coyote!

01:22:53.597 --> 01:22:56.518
So you made a
deal with the cops?

01:22:58.060 --> 01:22:59.518
What if I told you you no
longer have a custody problem

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.562
in any court in Louisiana?

01:23:01.564 --> 01:23:02.606
Seriously?

01:23:08.863 --> 01:23:12.115
Oh my god, that poor kid.

01:24:30.614 --> 01:24:35.614
