WEBVTT

00:02.903 --> 00:06.040
So then I asked,
"Is there diary
in the beignets?"

00:06.140 --> 00:07.408
And the guy says --

00:07.508 --> 00:08.942
My mom is coming
to visit.

00:09.043 --> 00:11.245
Whoa.
Fay's coming?

00:11.345 --> 00:12.413
Next week.
Hmm.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.515
She called before
Louis and Jessica came over.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.617
She wants to help me
get ready for the baby.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.052
Yeah, but I thought
that you and Jessica

00:18.152 --> 00:19.553
were gonna go on
that Best Friends cruise

00:19.653 --> 00:21.055
that you won
on "Wheel of Fortune."

00:21.155 --> 00:23.091
I'm sorry, Jessica.
I can't go.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.558
Good.
I can't go, either.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.394
To beautiful Cozumel?
Why not?

00:26.494 --> 00:28.762
I saw on the nightly news
that every year,

00:28.862 --> 00:31.265
one woman falls
off a cruise ship.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.733
It's only January.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.769
If I went out there
and somebody pushed me over,

00:35.869 --> 00:36.870
as I was falling
to my death,

00:36.970 --> 00:39.107
I would be thinking,
"This is all my fault.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.109
I knew it was January."

00:41.209 --> 00:44.078
I am so glad
you're gonna be here.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.646
I could use your help
with my mom.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.581
She still treats me
like a teenager.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.049
She is very controlling.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.784
Well,
I am also controlling.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.086
I love control.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.121
Pass the water.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.423
Control.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.491
Exactly.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.093
So, with you on my side,

00:59.193 --> 01:01.495
I'll finally have control...
through you.

01:01.595 --> 01:04.098
I think that is
a dynamite plan,

01:04.198 --> 01:06.734
the two of you
taking on Fay together.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.269
Building off that,

01:08.369 --> 01:10.671
maybe Louis and I could go
on that cruise.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.507
I mean, it expires, right?
We don't want to lose it.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.309
It is slow at the restaurant
after the holidays.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.145
January's when people
lie to themselves

01:17.245 --> 01:18.246
about getting in shape.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.414
Great.
Sounds like a plan.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.450
And of course,
I'll call you every night

01:22.550 --> 01:23.984
to say, "I love you."

01:24.084 --> 01:25.119
Aww.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.820
And I will also
call you every night --

01:26.920 --> 01:27.855
Ship-to-shore calls
cost a fortune.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.857
If you truly love me,
don't call.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.793
Okay.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.795
**

01:34.895 --> 01:36.297
* Fresh off the boat *

01:36.397 --> 01:37.798
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

01:37.898 --> 01:39.933
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

01:40.033 --> 01:41.369
* Fresh off the boat *

01:41.469 --> 01:43.837
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

01:43.937 --> 01:45.105
* But I know where I'm goin' *

01:45.206 --> 01:48.108
* I'm fresh off the boat *

01:48.209 --> 01:50.844
Okay, my mom will
get to my house at 11:40.

01:50.944 --> 01:51.879
You come over at 11:45.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.847
She'll have been there
for five minutes,

01:53.947 --> 01:55.149
so you'll walk in
mid-fight.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.651
It'll be something about how
I'm not being pregnant right.

01:57.751 --> 01:58.852
Just take my side,

01:58.952 --> 02:00.988
and then strongly suggest
my mom take a nap.

02:01.088 --> 02:03.157
I'll just say she looks tired
from her travels --

02:03.257 --> 02:05.125
a long way from Salt Lake City,
blah, blah, blah.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.395
She's from Scottsdale,
but, yeah, that's fine.

02:07.495 --> 02:10.164
Oh, also,
since Marvin's gone,

02:10.264 --> 02:12.633
will you come with me to this
parenting class I signed up for?

02:12.733 --> 02:15.135
Can I use
a fake name in the class?

02:15.236 --> 02:16.570
Just for fun, you know?

02:16.670 --> 02:20.208
I've always wanted to try
the name "Cynthia McCormick."

02:21.074 --> 02:22.643
Honey, here are
the red paint swatches

02:22.743 --> 02:25.045
from when the HOA repainted
that fire hydrant.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.514
Thank you.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.416
Ooh, so many shades!

02:28.516 --> 02:29.683
So,
what are you painting?

02:29.783 --> 02:31.018
You know how most people

02:31.118 --> 02:33.153
assign gender to their babies
through color?

02:34.322 --> 02:36.590
You know, how they paint
their nursery pink or blue

02:36.690 --> 02:37.891
based on the baby's sex?

02:37.991 --> 02:41.429
I want to do our nursery
in a gender-neutral color --

02:41.529 --> 02:42.863
red.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.699
Red? No.
Satan was a red baby.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.502
Satan?
The Devil. Lucifer.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.338
Beelzebub.
The Beast.

02:50.438 --> 02:51.872
Yeah, no,
I know who Satan is.

02:51.972 --> 02:55.376
I just don't think red
is gonna...summon him.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.378
You don't think,
but you don't know

02:57.478 --> 02:59.747
because no one's been crazy
enough to take the chance.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.682
Please do not bring
the Shadow King

03:01.782 --> 03:02.883
into this neighborhood.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.286
**

03:05.386 --> 03:06.887
Dragonflies
don't have stingers.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.522
I didn't get stung.

03:08.622 --> 03:09.923
I was in the driveway

03:10.023 --> 03:14.061
when a dragonfly landed on me
and injected its eggs in my arm.

03:14.161 --> 03:16.730
There's a new transfer student,
and she's cute.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.098
This school is huge.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.433
There's no way you can know
every girl that goes here.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.935
Of course I can.
What else am I doing?

03:22.903 --> 03:25.273
Look.
She's right there.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.276
Looks like
she needs assistance.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.620
* I'm just a bachelor *

03:39.720 --> 03:43.291
* I'm looking for a partner *

03:43.391 --> 03:45.759
I'm not ready to be a dad.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.762
* Ride it, my pony *

03:48.862 --> 03:53.233
* My saddle's waitin' *

03:53.334 --> 03:54.502
Hi.
I'm Karen.

03:54.602 --> 03:57.104
Could you show me to my class?
I'm new.

03:57.204 --> 03:58.339
Tight.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.607
I'm Eddie.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.275
I'll show you where
the good bathroom is, too.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.577
All the graffiti
is really positive.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.280
* Yeah *

04:07.581 --> 04:09.817
Did we not agree to keep
that restroom a secret?

04:09.917 --> 04:12.853
**

04:12.953 --> 04:15.423
I'm late.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.025
HONEY: 'Cause if you read it
in a magazine,

04:18.125 --> 04:19.360
it has to be true,
right?!

04:19.460 --> 04:21.094
Well, I don't care
what you read about in Forbes,

04:21.194 --> 04:22.796
I am breast-feeding
my baby!

04:22.896 --> 04:25.132
Jessica,
what a pleasant surprise.

04:25.232 --> 04:28.436
My mom just got here...
six minutes ago.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.705
So, you think your body,

04:31.805 --> 04:33.173
the same body
that produces urine,

04:33.273 --> 04:36.176
can naturally produce nutrition
better than scientists in a lab?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.445
I don't think so.

04:37.545 --> 04:40.348
Breast-feeding is efficient
and economical.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.615
All the food is free,

04:41.715 --> 04:42.650
plus you don't
have to waste gas

04:42.750 --> 04:44.284
driving to the store
because the store,

04:44.385 --> 04:46.019
it's right there
on you -- two locations.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.221
Thank you, Jessica.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.457
Mom, this is my neighbor

04:49.557 --> 04:51.024
and best friend
I was telling you about.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.860
Hello, nice to meet --
Nice to meet you.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.861
You look weary.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.295
You should consider
taking a nap.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.997
Oh.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.399
Well,
I guess I am tired

04:58.499 --> 05:01.702
from searching for where Honey
keeps her water glasses.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.804
Maybe I will go lie down.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.243
Thank you so much.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.879
You diffused
that whole situation.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.582
Well, no one can control
the controller, Honey.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.183
I'm like a universal remote.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.352
I mute
any TV you point me at.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.853
All right, well,

05:19.953 --> 05:22.990
I better run to the store
and pick up a roast chicken.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.993
My mom likes to tear into a bird
when she wakes up.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.999
Well, that was one hell
of a send

05:32.099 --> 05:34.067
Where were those people
when I pushed off for Guam?

05:34.167 --> 05:35.603
You know, I've never been

05:35.703 --> 05:37.405
on an all-inclusive
vacation before.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.740
I'm gonna take advantage
of everything on this ship

05:39.840 --> 05:40.908
and not spend a dime.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.110
Sounds like you're gonna go
all out, huh, buddy?

05:43.210 --> 05:46.346
Or am I going...
full steam ahead?

05:46.447 --> 05:47.881
On a passenger vessel?

05:47.981 --> 05:49.417
Dear God, I hope not.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.551
Oh.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.288
I drew a circle around it

05:55.389 --> 05:57.124
to see if my baby bump's
getting bigger.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.859
It's firmer.
You want to feel?
I'm good.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.794
How'd it go
with the new girl?

06:00.894 --> 06:02.396
She wants to eat lunch
together.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.731
Maybe it's just
the hormones

06:03.831 --> 06:05.399
from the dragonfly pregnancy
talking,

06:05.499 --> 06:07.435
but I'm really happy
for you, Eddie.

06:07.535 --> 06:10.270
I don't know.
I can't tell if she likes me.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.605
Just give her
the "Soda test."

06:11.705 --> 06:14.775
Crack open a can, take a sip,
and offer her some.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.911
If she goes lip-to-can instead
of pouring it from above...

06:19.913 --> 06:21.214
Then she definitely
likes you.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.154
Sip?

06:27.254 --> 06:30.057
Okay.

06:30.157 --> 06:34.227
**

06:34.327 --> 06:38.331
**

06:39.733 --> 06:42.970
Ooooooh!

06:43.070 --> 06:44.805
* Yeah *

06:44.905 --> 06:46.073
**

06:46.173 --> 06:48.141
Have you heard of this new thing
called "co-sleeping"

06:48.241 --> 06:50.277
where the baby sleeps in bed
with you?

06:50.377 --> 06:51.612
JESSICA: Ridiculous.

06:51.712 --> 06:52.913
You know,
I used the same crib

06:53.013 --> 06:55.949
for all three of my boys --
no successful escapes.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.117
What's going on?

06:57.217 --> 06:59.653
Oh, hi, dear.
Jessica and I are just chatting.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.622
I came back over
because I heard screaming.

07:01.722 --> 07:02.990
I couldn't find the towels.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.357
They're in the linen closet.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.426
Anyway, Jessica and I
started talking,

07:06.527 --> 07:08.596
and we share many
of the same philosophies.

07:08.696 --> 07:11.699
Like baby-proofing the house --
It's nonsense.

07:11.799 --> 07:15.302
Your kids stubs their toe,
they feel pain, they learn.

07:15.402 --> 07:18.639
Honey burned herself
in the fireplace three times.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.308
We refused to put up a screen.
She learned.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.476
Yes! Yes!

07:22.576 --> 07:24.344
It's about time
someone said it.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.445
Thank you, Fay.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.880
Oh, please.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.315
Call me Mrs. St. Claire.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.350
Oh. Mm-hmm.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.285
**

07:35.623 --> 07:37.791
Jessica,
a word in the nursery?

07:37.891 --> 07:38.692
Uh...

07:38.792 --> 07:40.127
I haven't painted it yet.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.128
Okay.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.565
You're supposed
to be on my side.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.833
You said you'd support me.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.168
Oh, you're right.
I'm sorry.

07:48.268 --> 07:51.371
I'm just drawn
to a strong critical energy.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.472
I will admit that.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.174
Okay, well,
we need to go back out there

07:54.274 --> 07:56.209
and present a united
mothering front.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.344
Absolutely.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.179
Whatever you want,
I'll follow you're lead.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.481
Whoa.

08:04.918 --> 08:08.255
Honey, what is this?
I went rummaging.

08:08.355 --> 08:12.025
It's a parenting class
Jessica and I are going to.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.828
"Wilhelmina Page,
Child Sage"?

08:14.928 --> 08:17.430
Babies shouldn't play
with phones.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.432
It's reckless.
What if it called 911?

08:19.533 --> 08:21.535
Well, then it should be given
a MacArthur Grant

08:21.635 --> 08:23.270
because at that stage
of development,

08:23.370 --> 08:24.337
it would be a genius --

08:24.437 --> 08:26.707
a genius hero baby.

08:26.807 --> 08:27.775
Hmm.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.409
The Page Method
is about letting the baby

08:29.509 --> 08:30.711
tell you what it needs.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.179
Babies can't talk.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.048
This baby-led parenting
just means

08:35.148 --> 08:37.050
letting the child
do whatever it wants

08:37.150 --> 08:39.186
and catering to it
every time it cries.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.388
Crying means
it needs something.

08:41.488 --> 08:42.690
Right, Jessica?

08:45.292 --> 08:46.359
Yes.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.028
Mm-hmm.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.563
That class...

08:49.663 --> 08:53.801
seems like a great use
of time.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.603
Hmm.

08:55.703 --> 08:56.704
Can I come, then?

08:56.804 --> 08:58.906
Y

08:59.006 --> 09:00.107
Well, I've rummaged through

09:00.207 --> 09:01.108
everything worth
rummaging through.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.610
I'll just sit in the back,

09:02.710 --> 09:05.478
reading my Forbes,
breaking in my new boat shoes.

09:05.579 --> 09:08.916
**

09:09.016 --> 09:10.751
I'm meeting Karen
at the library,

09:10.851 --> 09:12.986
then we're going to her house
and chill.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.088
Halt!

09:15.188 --> 09:16.724
Eddie,
I have bad news.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.058
As a member
of the Safety Patrol,

09:18.158 --> 09:19.593
I was helping Karen
set up her locker,

09:19.693 --> 09:22.262
and I saw a picture
of her and her ex-boyfriend

09:22.362 --> 09:23.430
from a school dance.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.600
He's Asian.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.168
So?

09:28.268 --> 09:30.103
So, she didn't pick you
over us.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.672
She's just got a "thing."

09:31.772 --> 09:33.741
She's only into you
because you're Asian.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.943
As a ginger who's been
repeatedly objectified,

09:36.043 --> 09:37.845
you don't want
to go down this road.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.312
Now it makes sense.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.014
She didn't even look my way.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.916
I usually get
at least one glance,

09:43.016 --> 09:44.251
even if it's defensive.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.486
She also has a picture up
of her favorite guitarist.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.454
Hendrix?

09:47.554 --> 09:49.322
Iha -- James Iha,

09:49.422 --> 09:51.959
the blond Asian guitarist
from The Smashing Pumpkins.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.326
Nah, man.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.129
She picked me because she has
a preference for dope G's.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.798
You guys are just jealous.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.499
I'll prove it.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.301
**

10:05.238 --> 10:07.307
-17. Winner.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.476
Come on, Lou,
you gonna play or what?

10:09.576 --> 10:10.610
Oh, just watching.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.279
I'm not spending any money
on this trip.

10:12.379 --> 10:15.348
How many servings of prime rib
have you had at the buffet?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.150
Mm...four.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.653
Okay, at market value
of $19.99 each,

10:19.753 --> 10:21.121
you're already up
80 bucks.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.023
You know what?
You're right.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.624
I'm playing
with house money right now.

10:25.759 --> 10:32.499
**

10:32.599 --> 10:34.334
I'll stay.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.803
Split me.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.240
Hot dog!
Double split.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.374
Split me.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.679
**

10:45.779 --> 10:48.215
Double-down city, Lou.
All right.

10:49.850 --> 10:54.654
DEALER: 17, 20, 18, 14.

10:54.755 --> 10:58.692
Dealer has 13, 16.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.728
Dealer has 21.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.502
**

11:09.602 --> 11:12.005
I don't even like oysters.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.874
But they're so expensive,
they're the most efficient way

11:13.974 --> 11:16.844
for me to make up
for my gambling losses.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.545
Clockwise from the left,
we have Fanny Bay --

11:18.645 --> 11:20.347
Don't care.
Just keep 'em coming.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.352
For centuries,

11:25.452 --> 11:28.221
mothers have believed
that they know best.

11:28.321 --> 11:31.558
But what if we flipped that?

11:31.658 --> 11:35.763
What if baby knows best?

11:35.863 --> 11:37.430
Mm-hmm.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.465
Powerful.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.432
Yes.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.534
I'm Wilhelmina Page,

11:41.634 --> 11:45.773
author of "Hear Me:
My Nine Months in the Womb,"

11:45.873 --> 11:51.111
a first-person account
of being inside my own mother.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.049
Think of your heartbeat

11:56.149 --> 11:58.585
as a telegraph to the truth...

11:58.685 --> 12:02.756
...and your baby
is trying to pound out a message

12:02.856 --> 12:04.724
in Morse code.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.459
Can you hear it?

12:06.559 --> 12:09.062
Listen.
Lean in.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.801
The baby is saying "Beep beep.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.303
Who got the keys to the Jeep?"

12:16.403 --> 12:18.338
Ha! Just playin'.
I love Missy Elliott.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.573
We gonna have some fun
in here today.

12:20.673 --> 12:21.975
Let me get the questionnaires.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.278
She's a riot.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.283
Hey.
I picked us up a couple snacks.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.451
Which do you prefer --

12:31.551 --> 12:35.322
Squiddies, a snack found
in most Asian households,

12:35.422 --> 12:36.623
or Snickers?

12:36.723 --> 12:39.126
Snickers all day.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.361
Which one of these books
seems more interesting?

12:41.461 --> 12:43.296
"The Tao of Gung Fu"
by Bruce Lee

12:43.396 --> 12:46.133
or "The Secret Power Within"
by Chuck Norris?

12:46.233 --> 12:47.100
Chuck Norris.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.870
He's great in that movie
"Sidekicks."

12:50.637 --> 12:52.272
Oh, no.
My shoe's untied.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.640
Who will help me?

12:53.740 --> 12:57.544
Oh, no. My shoe is also untied,
and I, too, need help.

12:57.644 --> 13:00.013
**

13:00.113 --> 13:02.649
Oh, it's okay.
Let me help you.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.286
Knew those fools
were just jealous.

13:07.855 --> 13:09.857
Ah!
He's fine.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.324
We've helped enough children
for one day.

13:11.424 --> 13:12.792
Shall we chill?

13:13.961 --> 13:17.330
Okay, let's review
your questionnaire responses.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.166
Question number one --

13:19.266 --> 13:22.169
How do you know
when to feed your baby?

13:22.269 --> 13:23.136
Hmm?

13:23.236 --> 13:24.905
Beth C. wrote --
W

13:25.005 --> 13:27.040
Right here.
I'm Beth C.

13:27.140 --> 13:32.212
Welcome.
Beth C. wrote, "It depends."

13:32.312 --> 13:33.413
It does.
Right?

13:33.513 --> 13:37.050
It depends on what your baby
is telling you,

13:37.150 --> 13:39.052
because the best
feeding schedule

13:39.152 --> 13:41.989
is the one your baby designs.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.490
Write that down.

13:43.590 --> 13:44.591
Question number two --

13:44.691 --> 13:48.395
When is it appropriate
to hug your child?

13:48.495 --> 13:52.065
Cynthia McCormick wrote...
"Christmas Eve"?

13:52.165 --> 13:54.734
Affection
is a powerful motivator.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.903
If you hug them
all the time,

13:56.003 --> 13:58.438
they won't know
when you really mean it.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.673
Okay, you know what?

14:00.773 --> 14:02.742
Why don't we switch gears, huh?

14:02.842 --> 14:05.078
Let's get
into swaddling techniques.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.413
Now, unfortunately,

14:06.513 --> 14:09.016
my little cat
did get into the storage room

14:09.116 --> 14:10.417
and peed on all the baby dolls,

14:10.517 --> 14:14.554
so step right over here,
grab a cloth and a melon.

14:14.654 --> 14:15.455
Come on.

14:17.824 --> 14:20.593
Hey, hey.
So, what do you think?

14:20.693 --> 14:21.794
Well, it's nice to know

14:21.895 --> 14:24.264
that if we forget anything,
the baby will tell us.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.598
Ugh!
This is so dumb!

14:25.698 --> 14:27.200
I thought you were
just playing along.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.701
I'm just trying
to be supportive.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.370
Well, the best way
to be supportive

14:30.470 --> 14:31.972
is to be honest
with Honey.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.707
She's never been a mom.
She doesn't know.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.544
Oh, I think
I'm doing it wrong.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.047
Everybody else's melon
looks happy.

14:40.147 --> 14:41.915
Right.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.216
She's vulnerable,

14:43.316 --> 14:45.885
overwhelmed
by pregnancy hormones.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.254
And Beth C.
is not helping,

14:47.354 --> 14:48.755
just nodding along
with everything.

14:48.855 --> 14:52.592
T-This all makes sense.
Yeah.

14:52.692 --> 14:56.463
We need to pull Honey aside
and tell her this is nonsense.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.231
It's for her own good.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.100
We have experience.
She doesn't.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.269
Okay.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.972
It doesn't have legs,
so...

15:06.573 --> 15:08.675
JESSICA: Honey, we have
to be honest with you --

15:08.775 --> 15:10.677
This class is garbage.

15:10.777 --> 15:13.846
We both think it's a waste
of time and money.

15:13.947 --> 15:14.914
Not me.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.783
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.486
If this is what Honey wants,
I support her.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.791
I don't know what you're talking
about. That's not what I said.

15:24.891 --> 15:27.694
You said we were gonna
be honest with Honey.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.963
I was being honest
with her.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.966
I think that Page woman
has some great ideas,

15:33.066 --> 15:35.168
and that's what I told you.
That's not what you said.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.369
I've only been honest
with you

15:36.469 --> 15:38.338
about how I feel,
even when we disagree.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.007
You're the one
that was in there

15:40.107 --> 15:42.209
pretending to like
all that stuff.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.643
HONEY: Look,
Jessica may be a lot of things,

15:43.743 --> 15:46.179
but she is not a liar.
Truth!

15:46.279 --> 15:47.847
She's here because
I asked her to be here.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.516
You're here because the idea

15:49.616 --> 15:52.685
of me raising a baby without
your input drives you nuts.

15:52.785 --> 15:56.023
It drives me nuts
because your ideas are crazy.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.558
I don't understand what daughter
doesn't want her mother's help.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.360
I would love your help,

16:00.460 --> 16:03.030
but you're not trying to help,
you're trying to control.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.531
Well,
you need to be controlled.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.300
Look at the garbage
you're buying into.
Aha!

16:07.400 --> 16:09.469
Look, I told you she thought
this was garbage, Honey.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.039
Anybody else's mother thinks
this class is garbage,

16:12.139 --> 16:13.806
speak up now.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.508
Huh

16:15.608 --> 16:16.509
Hey, you know what?

16:16.609 --> 16:18.311
I've had enough of this.
I'm out of here.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.681
Oh, well, that's real mature,
young lady.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.083
I guess
your best friend and I

16:23.183 --> 16:24.984
will just find
our own way home.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.987
Maybe your child sage
has a bus schedule.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.357
I'm gonna get a taxi.
Yes, good.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.724
We should go after her.
Wha--

16:31.824 --> 16:33.893
I'm not going after her.
I'm going to the airport.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.228
You're just gonna leave?

16:35.328 --> 16:36.829
So what?
Honey left.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.098
But you're her mother.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.432
This is what she does.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.901
She runs away
and wants me to follow her.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.071
She lives
for this kind of drama.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.572
She'll be fine.
Trust me.

16:45.672 --> 16:49.376
**

16:49.476 --> 16:51.611
Yeah, I don't know why libraries
don't charge to make copies.

16:51.711 --> 16:55.382
So many cheeks have been
on that glass -- face and butt.

16:56.949 --> 17:00.053
Wow, your ex-boo really changed
his look over the years --

17:00.153 --> 17:01.621
went back and forth
on the bangs.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.856
No, those are
three different guys.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.792
**

17:05.892 --> 17:07.560
What?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.362
My friends are right.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.398
You do have a thing
for Asian dudes.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.765
What are you talking about?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.802
All your exes and guitar heroes
have been Asian.

17:15.902 --> 17:18.438
I-I never really
thought about it,

17:18.538 --> 17:20.407
but, yeah,
I guess they have.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.143
So?
Don't you think that's weird?

17:23.243 --> 17:24.411
No.
Why would that be weird?

17:24.511 --> 17:25.878
Do you think it's weird

17:25.978 --> 17:27.114
that all the girls you've liked
have been white?

17:27.214 --> 17:28.715
But that's different.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.618
See, that's not a preference,
that's just what's around.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.920
I first talked to you because
I saw your "X-Files" shirt.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.155
I love that show.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.923
I thought it was gonna be
about Malcolm X,

17:37.023 --> 17:39.892
but it turned out to be a great
romantic sci-fi mystery.

17:39.992 --> 17:41.394
And then we started
hanging out,

17:41.494 --> 17:43.430
and I thought you were cool
and funny and cute.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.997
Okay.
That makes sense.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.400
So should we start chilling,
or --

17:47.500 --> 17:48.968
But I was obviously wrong.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.937
So you don't have to worry
about who I like anymore,

17:51.037 --> 17:52.139
'cause it ain't you.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.907
Happy?
That make you feel good?

17:55.007 --> 17:56.909
No.
I feel bad.

17:57.009 --> 17:57.944
Please leave.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.815
Mm.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.518
I'm back to even.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.487
There are sun beds
down in the lower deck.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.322
I fell asleep.

18:11.191 --> 18:14.594
I'll pay for it in moles later,
but it was worth it.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.296
Hmm. Ohh.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.365
Mr. Huang, you have a phone call
from your wife.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.267
What's wrong?
What happened?

18:20.367 --> 18:22.135
Honey's mother
is a piece of work.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.636
What?

18:23.736 --> 18:26.105
They got into an argument,
and she just left town.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.841
I mean, I've threatened to leave
the kids many times --

18:28.941 --> 18:31.178
at the orphanage, at
the fire station, at the mall --

18:31.278 --> 18:32.679
but I've never
actually done it.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.182
Except for that time you left
them at the ice cream store.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.116
We agreed to call that
an accident.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.287
I know I need to go find Honey
and talk to her,

18:40.387 --> 18:41.954
but I don't know
what to say.

18:42.054 --> 18:43.856
I feel the same way
her mom does

18:43.956 --> 18:45.325
about a lot
of this baby stuff,

18:45.425 --> 18:46.859
but Honey
wouldn't listen to her.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.229
Sounds like she just needs
your support as a friend.

18:49.329 --> 18:52.064
Her mom left.
You would never abandon her.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.167
No, I wouldn't.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.336
Not even by accident.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.804
I have to go.

18:57.904 --> 19:01.674
Bring me back a giant seashell
I can blow to summon the kids.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.078
Your phone charges, sir.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.552
I can't eat
any more oysters.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.993
Hey.

19:21.093 --> 19:22.229
How did you know
I was here?

19:22.329 --> 19:26.899
When you're upset, you crave
high-sodium meats on meat.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.737
My mom already left,
didn't she?

19:32.339 --> 19:33.840
It's crazy.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.443
We have never been close,
but for whatever reason,

19:36.543 --> 19:38.711
I just hoped it would
be different this time.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.680
I'm sorry that happened.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.550
Hey, I get it.

19:43.650 --> 19:44.884
When I first got pregnant,

19:44.984 --> 19:48.421
not only was my mom not here,
but I was new to this country.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.457
I didn't know
how anything worked.

19:50.557 --> 19:53.059
I didn't have any friends
who were moms.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.895
I had to figure it out
on my own.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.030
That must have been
so scary.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.400
Not as scary
as your nursery will be

20:00.500 --> 20:01.634
after we paint it red,

20:01.734 --> 20:04.571
which I will help you do

20:04.671 --> 20:06.239
because I support you.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.707
Thank you.

20:07.807 --> 20:08.708
Just to throw it out there,

20:08.808 --> 20:12.078
yellow is also
a sexless baby color,

20:12.178 --> 20:16.449
But it's like a sunflower
instead of the fires of Hell.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.718
Just to throw it
out there.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.421
But whatever you want.
Let's do yellow.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.493
So, the bite on your arm
just went away?

20:26.593 --> 20:28.328
Yeah, I woke up,
and it was gone.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.997
Maybe I absorbed the dragonfly
babies into my blood.

20:31.097 --> 20:34.233
Dave, please.
I'm halfway through
a clementine.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.602
Great job, idiots.

20:35.702 --> 20:40.006
Turns out Karen just
liked me for me -- or used to.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.908
Now I have no prospects
on the horizon,

20:42.008 --> 20:43.643
and one more person knows
about our secret bathroom.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.979
So I hope you like seeing girls'
Keds under the stall doors,

20:47.079 --> 20:48.348
because that's what's happening.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.518
You know what?
I'm fine with it.

20:51.618 --> 20:55.755
**

20:55.855 --> 20:57.156
What are you doing back?

20:57.256 --> 20:58.525
The cruise lasts
till next week.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.692
Great news!

20:59.792 --> 21:02.295
Oh, your zinc intake
is dangerous, Lou.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.997
That's a lot of bivalves
for one man.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.266
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.668
Ahoy!

21:08.768 --> 21:10.470
We regret to inform you
that a female passenger

21:10.570 --> 21:11.804
has fallen overboard.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.973
We need a complete head count
at this time.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.476
Please return to your cabins
immediately.

21:16.576 --> 21:20.347
We will be returning to port
and giving everyone a refund.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.614
Someone fell off the ship.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.650
I got a full refund.
Didn't spend a dime.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.784
And my seashell?

21:24.884 --> 21:26.553
