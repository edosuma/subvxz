WEBVTT

00:00.073 --> 00:03.975
Wait till I tell Robin
you've been hoarding the good stuff.

00:06.179 --> 00:09.376
Merlin! They're kidnapping my Merlin.

00:09.415 --> 00:12.907
If she isn't gone soon,
I'm going to commit murder.

00:13.953 --> 00:18.049
- What on earth is that?
- The attack cry of the peregrine falcon.

00:18.091 --> 00:21.686
If you find Dr. Tessa,
she can interview him and leave.

00:21.728 --> 00:23.719
You are on private property.

00:23.763 --> 00:26.061
I am allowed by law to shoot.

00:26.099 --> 00:28.226
He's a weird character.

00:28.935 --> 00:29.924
Agh!

03:03.656 --> 03:07.148
- Do you have it?
- I have it.

03:07.193 --> 03:09.957
You're doing the right thing.
This uprising is foolish.

03:09.996 --> 03:14.797
When the leaders of these so-called freedom
fighters are in prison, this bloodshed can end.

03:16.369 --> 03:20.100
Everything you need is in there.

03:20.139 --> 03:22.903
- You are doing the right thing.
- I know.

03:22.942 --> 03:25.274
I will see that...

03:25.311 --> 03:28.144
Stop!

03:57.713 --> 03:59.122
Magnum?

04:00.930 --> 04:05.060
- I say, Magnum?
- Hold your horses. I'll let you...

04:06.903 --> 04:10.395
- right in.
- Magnum, I must have a word with you.

04:10.440 --> 04:13.705
No. I want a word with you.

04:13.743 --> 04:16.974
I wanna talk to you
about your vocabulary.

04:17.012 --> 04:21.040
What edification could you provide
regarding my vocabulary?

04:21.084 --> 04:25.544
I am talking about the word
"privacy" or pry-vacy or whatever you call it.

04:25.588 --> 04:29.251
You obviously are ignorant
of the meaning of the word,

04:29.292 --> 04:32.887
both in letter and in spirit.

04:32.929 --> 04:36.695
- I must say, I'm impressed.
- With my dictionary?

04:36.732 --> 04:38.723
No, your living quarters.

04:38.768 --> 04:41.635
- They're tidy.
- Don't act so surprised.

04:41.671 --> 04:44.936
Where is all
the usual unpleasantness,

04:44.974 --> 04:48.808
the abandoned food and drink,
the soiled garments,

04:48.845 --> 04:52.679
the unidentifiable artifacts
I expect to find when I walk in?

04:52.715 --> 04:59.746
Aha! That is precisely my point.
You expect to walk in. Higgins...

04:59.789 --> 05:04.783
- I don't walk in on you, do I?
- Of course you do. All the time.

05:04.827 --> 05:07.455
It's one of life's unpleasanteries,

05:07.497 --> 05:10.864
like a minor rash
or an ingrown toenail.

05:10.900 --> 05:15.462
I'm here to remind you that today
Miss Elizabeth Barrett arrives.

05:15.505 --> 05:19.271
- That, of course, means...
- I will be gone. I promise.

05:19.308 --> 05:23.836
I'm after this guy who stiffed me for $800.
Kraig Maynard, king of the condos.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.610
Maynard is
a well-known developer.

05:26.649 --> 05:28.742
He's on the board at the club.

05:28.784 --> 05:31.184
Why do you think he stiffed you?

05:31.220 --> 05:35.680
Because he did not pay me
for services rendered, that's why.

05:35.725 --> 05:38.285
You see... You'll find this interesting.

05:38.327 --> 05:41.854
His sales lady ran off to Vegas
with the bank deposits.

05:41.898 --> 05:45.425
I found her, but now I can't...
I can't find my keys.

05:45.468 --> 05:48.960
They're not your keys.
They're Mr. Masters' keys.

05:52.141 --> 05:57.875
Unless I find them, I'll be stuck here
with you and his old schoolmarm.

05:57.914 --> 06:01.111
Elizabeth Barrett
is not an old schoolmarm.

06:01.150 --> 06:04.483
As Robin Masters'
former English instructor,

06:04.520 --> 06:07.956
she inspired
and sent Mr. Masters on

06:07.990 --> 06:10.891
to his meteoric writing career.

06:10.927 --> 06:13.794
Now that she's writing her own book,

06:13.829 --> 06:16.320
I expect you to keep a low profile.

06:16.365 --> 06:19.562
I promise, Higgins,
no football games on the lawn,

06:19.602 --> 06:22.036
no gunfire before breakfast,

06:22.071 --> 06:25.768
no stewardesses unless
they promise not to yodel.

06:25.808 --> 06:28.800
I never should have cleaned up.

06:39.288 --> 06:40.312
Aha!

06:44.093 --> 06:48.462
Ah, the refrigerator. Remiss of me
not to have thought of it myself.

06:48.497 --> 06:51.830
After all, where else
would one store one's keys?

07:06.315 --> 07:09.842
<i>The white zone is for loading
and unloading only.</i>

07:09.885 --> 07:13.878
<i>All others will be towed away
at owners' expense.</i>

07:16.759 --> 07:20.126
<i>The white zone is for loading
and unloading only.</i>

07:20.162 --> 07:23.654
<i>All others will be towed away
at owners' expense.</i>

07:25.868 --> 07:29.065
Thanks, boys. You're doing a fine job.

07:29.105 --> 07:33.508
Heads up, everybody.

07:33.542 --> 07:36.978
Well, here's looking at you.

07:37.013 --> 07:38.981
<i>Flight 476 is now boarding</i>...

07:39.015 --> 07:41.848
Miss Barrett, I presume? I'm Jonathan...

07:41.884 --> 07:44.546
Livingston Seagull.

07:45.321 --> 07:48.518
Jonathan Higgins. Aloha.

07:50.159 --> 07:52.354
Welcome to Hawaii.

07:52.395 --> 07:55.296
Why, thank you, Higgins.

07:55.331 --> 07:59.665
Robin's told me all about you,
but I decided to come anyway.

08:00.403 --> 08:03.600
Just kidding, Johnny. Just kidding.

08:03.639 --> 08:06.472
I know Robin can't get along without you.

08:06.509 --> 08:11.412
Here, try some of
this marvelous champagne.

08:11.447 --> 08:14.041
Airline specialty.

08:14.083 --> 08:16.278
Enough of it does do the trick.

08:16.319 --> 08:19.413
No, thank you. We must go.
I'm parked at the curb.

08:19.455 --> 08:22.356
Did you get Merlin out of quarantine?

08:22.391 --> 08:23.517
Merlin?

08:23.559 --> 08:27.893
- My macaw, Higgins. My macaw.
- The bird is in the car.

08:27.930 --> 08:31.491
It was quite far-sighted of you
to send it ahead.

08:31.534 --> 08:36.335
Merlin is not an it. He's a he.

08:36.371 --> 08:40.274
- Very intelligent bird.
- Indeed.

08:40.308 --> 08:43.607
We really must be going.
This way, gentlemen.

08:45.147 --> 08:49.743
I guess we have to follow
the little fellow, boys.

08:49.785 --> 08:53.687
<i>The white zone is for loading
and unloading only.</i>

08:53.723 --> 08:57.557
<i>All others will be towed away
at owners' expense.</i>

08:57.593 --> 08:59.254
Oh, my God!

08:59.295 --> 09:04.824
Merlin! They're kidnapping my Merlin.

09:06.102 --> 09:09.196
Don't just stand there. Do something.

09:09.238 --> 09:13.004
<i>The white zone is for loading and unloading</i>..
Stop! Stop!

09:13.676 --> 09:17.134
Halt! Halt!

09:32.161 --> 09:35.028
<i>Trying to find Maynard
was frustrating.</i>

09:35.064 --> 09:39.933
<i>All I kept getting was the arctic voice
of his secretary, Ms. Roebuck.</i>

09:39.969 --> 09:43.530
<i>Her voice gave me the image
of a sleeping polar bear</i>

09:43.572 --> 09:46.234
<i>who slipped off an iceberg into the drink</i>

09:46.275 --> 09:49.039
<i>and came up icy and snarly</i>.

09:49.078 --> 09:52.946
<i>400lb of anger, all teeth and claws</i>.

09:59.155 --> 10:02.591
Hi. They're closed.

10:03.392 --> 10:06.020
I know. I have the keys.

10:07.062 --> 10:09.360
You can't be Ms. Roebuck.

10:11.333 --> 10:13.494
Don't I have your permission?

10:13.536 --> 10:15.663
You're just not what I expected.

10:15.704 --> 10:18.537
I'm Bill Rogers.
I called about that condo in Maui,

10:18.574 --> 10:21.600
the one with the 360-degree view.

10:21.644 --> 10:24.807
Nice try, Magnum.

10:24.847 --> 10:28.112
The only view you'll see
is through barred windows

10:28.150 --> 10:31.381
- if you don't stop harassing me.
- Look, Ms. Roebuck.

10:31.420 --> 10:35.356
I came to get paid, not to get...

10:38.327 --> 10:40.318
insulted.

10:45.034 --> 10:49.403
- I want Maynard.
- Mr. Maynard is out of town.

10:49.438 --> 10:51.804
He is not. He's avoiding me.

10:51.841 --> 10:53.832
So am I.

10:56.812 --> 11:00.304
Careful with your shoes.
And don't scrape the tiles.

11:00.349 --> 11:02.715
They're impossible to clean.

11:02.751 --> 11:05.982
- After all, cleanliness is...
- Boring.

11:06.021 --> 11:08.512
Oh, driver, upstairs with that one.

11:11.927 --> 11:16.489
On the contrary, cleanliness
is the first bastion of civilization.

11:17.266 --> 11:20.724
I have the staff dust
every inch of the estate daily...

11:20.769 --> 11:22.999
Higgins! Higgins! Oh, Higgins.

11:23.038 --> 11:25.598
- I couldn't find the hose.
- Oh, my God.

11:25.641 --> 11:28.667
Relax. It's just a little dried mud.

11:28.711 --> 11:30.076
- You must be...
- Get out.

11:30.112 --> 11:32.672
- Magnum. You must be...
- Immediately.

11:32.715 --> 11:36.412
Elizabeth. It's a pleasure.
Robin's told me so much about you.

11:36.452 --> 11:40.548
- He did?
- Yes. Most of it terribly naughty.

11:40.589 --> 11:44.753
Driver, perhaps you should take that trunk

11:44.793 --> 11:47.762
and put it down in the study instead.

11:47.796 --> 11:51.288
The study? My study?

11:51.333 --> 11:54.131
It has all my work in it. We'll share.

11:54.169 --> 11:59.300
You work in the mornings.
I'll work at night. We'll also jog together.

11:59.341 --> 12:03.710
- 5am, starting tomorrow.
- Jog?

12:03.746 --> 12:06.237
You're certainly not up to running.

12:06.282 --> 12:10.912
After watching the way
you lumbered after that tow truck.

12:10.953 --> 12:11.942
Tow truck?

12:11.987 --> 12:16.617
Johnny had the foresight
to park in a tow-away zone.

12:16.659 --> 12:19.389
A tow-away zone? That's illegal, Johnny.

12:19.428 --> 12:21.726
I know.

12:21.764 --> 12:24.255
- Where's the study?
- In there.

12:25.734 --> 12:29.363
Johnny, do tip the man.
He's a worker, you know.

12:29.405 --> 12:35.435
Robin said you once had a case
with a Hungarian acrobat.

12:35.477 --> 12:38.708
Actually, it wasn't my case.

12:38.747 --> 12:41.238
I was hired by this guy...

12:42.318 --> 12:45.082
Let me guess. Mother-in-law?

12:46.255 --> 12:49.816
It was the prospect
of possibly of having to live

12:49.858 --> 12:52.725
with such a domineering woman
as Elizabeth

12:52.761 --> 12:56.492
that constrained me from ever
entering the state of matrimony.

12:56.532 --> 12:58.523
Huh?

12:59.702 --> 13:02.398
No, she's not my mother-in-law.

13:07.142 --> 13:09.372
Then I said to him, "Robin Masters",

13:09.411 --> 13:11.902
"what are you doing to that poor girl?"

13:11.947 --> 13:15.041
He looked me in the eye
and said, "Miss Barrett",

13:15.084 --> 13:18.383
"I'm not doing it to her, she's doing it to me."

13:23.926 --> 13:28.761
I suppose one must forgive
the excesses of adolescence.

13:28.797 --> 13:32.756
But do you have any anecdotes
of a more literary nature

13:32.801 --> 13:36.828
to regale the Pan-Pacific Academy
of Modern Literature?

13:36.872 --> 13:40.865
Anecdotes of a more
literary nature, my dear Johnny,

13:40.909 --> 13:45.471
would no doubt bore me and
your academy members spitless.

13:51.487 --> 13:53.478
Thomas, please.

13:53.522 --> 13:55.922
Oh, er...

13:55.958 --> 13:57.516
Thank you.

13:57.559 --> 14:02.019
Oh. Another dead soldier, Sergeant Major.

14:02.064 --> 14:04.055
Any reinforcements?

14:09.071 --> 14:11.539
I shall see.

14:12.708 --> 14:17.145
Well, Thomas, let me finish
telling you about my book.

14:17.179 --> 14:19.739
Right. The one about the bird watchers.

14:19.782 --> 14:25.311
Ornithologists. Some of them are even
more reclusive than the birds themselves.

14:25.354 --> 14:27.413
Take my Dr. Tessa, for instance.

14:27.456 --> 14:30.152
One of the foremost men in his field.

14:30.192 --> 14:32.353
One day suddenly he vanishes.

14:32.394 --> 14:34.555
Nobody had a clue where he'd gone,

14:34.596 --> 14:39.056
until I heard the rumors
about the Hermit of Hawaii.

14:39.101 --> 14:42.730
Well, that's my nickname for him.

14:42.771 --> 14:46.002
This hermit, are you sure
he's your Dr. Tessa?

14:46.041 --> 14:49.738
As a matter of fact, no.
I do know he speaks with an accent

14:49.778 --> 14:52.576
and that he's done amazing research
with birds.

14:52.614 --> 14:57.415
I'm just hoping he's my Dr. Tessa.
Can you help me, Thomas?

15:01.557 --> 15:04.549
Elizabeth, I'm a little tied up with this case.

15:04.593 --> 15:08.051
My motto, dear Thomas,
is a double negative.

15:08.097 --> 15:10.759
Never take no for an answer.

15:12.167 --> 15:15.295
Where's Johnny with that damn wine?

15:17.339 --> 15:19.773
Don't look at me like that, young man.

15:19.808 --> 15:23.938
I have trouble sleeping. Old people often do.

15:23.979 --> 15:27.608
They're afraid they won't wake up.

15:34.389 --> 15:39.452
Wait till I tell Robin
you've been hoarding the good stuff.

16:12.375 --> 16:14.129
Why me, Elizabeth?

16:15.078 --> 16:17.239
I'm a New Yorker. I never jog alone.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.510
Besides, you're pudgy. You need exercise.

16:19.549 --> 16:23.417
I believe in moderation,
particularly in exercise.

16:23.453 --> 16:27.014
That philosophy is quite visible
at your waistline.

16:27.057 --> 16:29.321
- I'm putting you on a diet.
- What?

16:29.359 --> 16:33.853
You heard me.
No cholesterol, high protein,

16:33.897 --> 16:38.596
and I make a terrific
artichoke raw-egg milkshake.

16:38.635 --> 16:42.264
Elizabeth, I can't go on...

16:43.073 --> 16:45.473
letting you wear yourself out.

16:45.508 --> 16:49.239
You must conserve energy for your book.

16:49.279 --> 16:52.271
- How's it coming?
- Great.

16:52.315 --> 16:56.046
If only I could find that elusive Dr. Tessa.

16:56.086 --> 16:59.715
- You must find him.
- Well, it isn't gonna be easy.

16:59.756 --> 17:04.056
He might have changed his name
to keep out of the limelight.

17:04.094 --> 17:06.255
Odd old bird.

17:07.564 --> 17:11.193
- That's a joke, Johnny.
- Oh.

17:11.233 --> 17:15.728
I see. I'm somewhat
of an ornithologist myself.

17:15.771 --> 17:18.468
Really? Do you do any calls?

17:24.114 --> 17:28.243
- What on earth is that?
- The attack cry of the peregrine falcon.

17:28.285 --> 17:33.120
Don't do it around Merlin.
You might freak him out.

17:33.156 --> 17:35.647
Last one back's a rotten egg.

17:37.661 --> 17:39.652
So be it.

17:40.397 --> 17:43.798
That was taken of Dr. Tessa
many years ago in Hungary.

17:43.833 --> 17:47.929
- Why's he so hard to find?
- He escaped after the revolt.

17:47.971 --> 17:50.872
Perhaps he's afraid they're still after him.

17:50.907 --> 17:53.967
This is the worst writing Robin
has perpetrated on the world

17:54.010 --> 17:56.638
since The Seamy Side Of Dawn.

17:56.680 --> 18:02.175
"I last saw her in Paris
in the Garden of Tuileries.

18:02.218 --> 18:05.119
"Her husband has returned from the front,

18:05.155 --> 18:07.180
"wounded but alive.

18:07.223 --> 18:11.216
"She must go and nurse him and I must go.

18:11.261 --> 18:15.163
"We do not kiss, but our hands briefly touch,

18:15.198 --> 18:18.133
"one last moment of gazing
into one another's eyes,"

18:18.168 --> 18:21.194
"reflecting on what might have been,"

18:21.237 --> 18:23.671
"before I wander up to Pigalle,"

18:23.707 --> 18:29.077
"the only place in Paris
that served palatable fish and chips."

18:29.112 --> 18:33.481
Fish and chips?
In the middle of a romantic scene?

18:33.516 --> 18:35.814
No wonder Robin gave up on it.

18:35.852 --> 18:40.812
It's hardly like Robin at all.
The writing is stiff and turgid.

18:40.857 --> 18:46.523
Mixed tenses, participles
dangling at every obtuse angle.

18:47.497 --> 18:50.057
But I can't resist correcting it.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.193
It warms me up to my own work.

18:52.235 --> 18:56.604
That manuscript happens to be
a draft of my memoirs.

18:56.639 --> 19:00.598
- No dogs. Out!
- The lads are totally trustworthy.

19:00.643 --> 19:03.510
Boy Scouts are trustworthy, Higgins.

19:03.546 --> 19:06.447
Dobermans are deadly. Banish them.

19:08.351 --> 19:11.184
Zeus, Apollo, patrol.

19:14.357 --> 19:17.520
Magnum, may I speak to you outside?

19:20.663 --> 19:22.654
Excuse me.

19:29.539 --> 19:33.373
Aw. That a good boy, Merlin.
That a good boy.

19:35.145 --> 19:38.273
Relax, Higgins. She's only here temporarily.

19:38.314 --> 19:42.580
Relax? You didn't have to endure
the spectacle of her inebriated arrival

19:42.619 --> 19:45.087
or hear her rude remarks or take her orders.

19:45.121 --> 19:49.888
Higgins, you yourself said
we must cherish her as Robin does.

19:49.926 --> 19:55.193
And then to invade the sacrosanct
privacy of my study with that... that bird.

19:55.231 --> 19:59.361
Kind of gets to you when your
privacy's intruded on, doesn't it?

19:59.402 --> 20:04.806
Magnum, wait. If you find this Dr. Tessa,
she could interview him and she'll leave.

20:04.841 --> 20:09.107
- She's really getting to you.
- I am prepared to offer you money.

20:09.145 --> 20:11.340
Money?

20:11.381 --> 20:15.317
No. There's a principle involved here.

20:15.351 --> 20:16.841
What principle?

20:16.886 --> 20:21.118
A private investigator should never
get stiffed by a deadbeat.

20:21.157 --> 20:23.955
- I gotta collect from Maynard.
- Take pity.

20:23.993 --> 20:26.826
She insists that I jog miles with her,

20:26.863 --> 20:30.026
that I imbibe
her grotesque artichoke protein concoctions.

20:30.066 --> 20:32.091
Worst, she's banished the lads.

20:32.168 --> 20:34.466
What's at stake here is my sanity.

20:34.504 --> 20:39.532
The hot tub, tennis courts, VCR,
camera and the wine cellar.

20:39.576 --> 20:41.806
- Three weeks.
- Done.

20:41.845 --> 20:46.111
I'm not finished. I want
the same privileges for Rick and T.C.

20:46.149 --> 20:48.379
- Rick and T.C.?
- Yes.

20:48.418 --> 20:53.788
I need them to find Maynard for me,
so that I can find Tessa for you.

20:53.823 --> 20:56.724
- Done.
- Higgins, give me a hand.

20:56.759 --> 21:01.787
Merlin's had a little accident
on the rug in your study.

21:01.831 --> 21:04.061
Just be quick about it.

21:08.905 --> 21:12.102
<i>I forgot to tell Higgins I'd already agreed</i>

21:12.142 --> 21:14.736
<i>to find Elizabeth's ornithologist</i>.

21:14.777 --> 21:17.974
<i>I didn't want him to take
my services for granted.</i>

21:18.014 --> 21:20.949
<i>Besides, I really liked the old schoolmarm</i>

21:20.984 --> 21:25.717
<i>and it kind of felt nice to be able to do
somebody sweet like that a favor.</i>

21:25.755 --> 21:27.746
- No favors.
- Nothing doing.

21:27.790 --> 21:31.191
- There must be some catch.
- Always there's a catch.

21:31.227 --> 21:33.821
- Gee, guys. Don't you trust me?
- No.

21:33.863 --> 21:37.230
Come on.
I'm offering you one full week

21:37.267 --> 21:39.497
of complete estate privileges.

21:39.536 --> 21:42.505
I didn't wanna ask for something for nothing.

21:42.539 --> 21:46.339
- I don't take you for granted.
- You take us for dummies.

21:46.376 --> 21:50.437
Maynard's one of the most visible guys
in the island, Thomas.

21:50.480 --> 21:53.813
- There's gotta be a catch.
- There is no catch. Honest.

21:53.850 --> 21:57.547
You find where he'll be
long enough for me to get there

21:57.587 --> 21:59.748
and collect the money, that's it.

21:59.789 --> 22:03.885
That's never it. Make it two weeks.

22:03.927 --> 22:07.090
And one hundred big ones.

22:07.130 --> 22:10.395
Three weeks and no money. Deal?

22:22.378 --> 22:24.369
Deal.

22:25.548 --> 22:30.281
At least now you know
you can't take us for granted.

22:34.090 --> 22:37.355
<i>I figured that locating Tessa
shouldn't be a problem.</i>

22:37.393 --> 22:41.124
<i>To find a bird expert,
just go where the birds are.</i>

22:41.164 --> 22:44.361
Tessa, Tessa. Nothing, nothing.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.834
No bells ring. Who is he?

22:46.869 --> 22:49.667
Lars, I told you, he's an ornithologist.

22:49.706 --> 22:52.470
He specializes in rare bird diseases.

22:52.508 --> 22:55.477
Nothing so sad than a sick bird.

22:55.511 --> 22:59.607
- You have a sick bird, haven't you?
- No, Lars, I don't.

22:59.649 --> 23:01.674
Dead already? That's bad.

23:01.718 --> 23:04.846
I have a tonic from an old guy.

23:04.887 --> 23:06.946
He might have saved your bird.

23:06.990 --> 23:08.981
What old guy?

23:13.229 --> 23:15.424
Lars?

23:15.465 --> 23:17.456
Bad monkey.

23:31.247 --> 23:33.841
- Where'd you get it?
- In the toolshed.

23:33.883 --> 23:36.579
Don't you pay any attention?

23:36.619 --> 23:40.316
- Who gave it to you, Lars?
- The toolshed?

23:40.356 --> 23:45.760
- It came with the zoo.
- Who gave you that tonic?

23:45.795 --> 23:50.198
There's an old guy living up in Haiku Valley.

23:50.233 --> 23:53.430
I got to tell you confidentially, though.

23:53.469 --> 23:56.131
He's a weird character.

24:29.539 --> 24:32.940
<i>Haiku Valley was accessible
from the sea over a reef,</i>

24:32.975 --> 24:37.002
<i>or from a road the army built in 1943
and hadn't repaired since.</i>

24:37.046 --> 24:42.040
<i>If Tessa was in the valley,
he was a man who liked to be left alone.</i>

24:44.053 --> 24:46.180
<i>Since this was government property,</i>

24:46.222 --> 24:48.747
<i>whoever wrote the sign
had no right to put it up.</i>

24:49.625 --> 24:55.461
<i>Of course, people often do things
they don't have a right to do.</i>

25:26.429 --> 25:27.555
Agh!

25:33.302 --> 25:35.930
Who are you? What are you doing here?

25:35.972 --> 25:39.135
Somebody ought to put up a sign.

25:39.175 --> 25:41.666
You are trespassing.

25:41.711 --> 25:44.805
I repeat, who are you?

25:44.847 --> 25:47.714
Thomas Magnum. I'm a private investigator.

25:47.750 --> 25:51.550
I'm doing legwork for a writer
who wants to interview you.

25:51.587 --> 25:55.819
- Me?
- Albert Tessa, the ornithologist?

25:55.858 --> 25:59.294
You are on private property. Please leave.

25:59.328 --> 26:01.387
This is government land.

26:01.431 --> 26:04.093
Goodbye, Mr. Magnum.

26:04.133 --> 26:08.968
If you are Tessa, this writer just
wants to interview you, that's all.

26:09.005 --> 26:13.442
If you return, I am allowed by law to shoot.

26:13.476 --> 26:15.444
No, you're not.

26:15.478 --> 26:18.470
I'm not gonna argue the point, though.

26:50.079 --> 26:52.775
<i>After nearly 30 years it was hard to be certain,</i>

26:52.815 --> 26:55.249
<i>but he looked like the man in the photo,</i>

26:55.284 --> 26:57.445
<i>even if he never admitted it</i>.

26:57.487 --> 27:00.547
<i>So why wasn't I in a hurry to tell Elizabeth?</i>

27:00.590 --> 27:04.686
<i>Elizabeth isn't the type to settle
for a "no trespassing" sign,</i>

27:04.727 --> 27:07.821
<i>and Tessa had a look about him
that I didn't like.</i>

27:07.864 --> 27:11.356
<i>I'd seen it before</i>.
<i>It divides people into two groups</i> -

27:11.400 --> 27:13.732
<i>those who can kill and those who can't</i>.

27:13.769 --> 27:15.396
<i>He was definitely in the first</i>.

27:19.242 --> 27:23.235
Don't worry, my pets. I won't ever leave you.

27:23.279 --> 27:25.804
I'll kill them all first.

27:38.875 --> 27:42.902
Thanks, Ace. Piece of cake.
Easiest deal we ever made.

27:42.946 --> 27:46.473
I can't believe Higgie baby
let us use Thomas's wheels.

27:46.516 --> 27:50.282
The Ferrari's owned
by Robin Masters, not Thomas.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.687
And that old broad
hanging around Higgins' neck,

27:53.724 --> 27:56.056
he'd give us anything.

27:57.694 --> 28:01.687
Just remember,
I'm the brains, you're the muscle.

28:03.500 --> 28:07.436
- You sure this is the place?
- Roebuck said the Dragon Bar.

28:07.471 --> 28:09.735
- This is the Dragon Bar.
- Right.

28:09.773 --> 28:13.573
The condo king's putting some
finishing touches on some lath and plaster.

28:13.610 --> 28:17.444
- Give me some brew, Drew.
- Ice tea, Lee.

28:17.481 --> 28:21.508
You think this Roebuck dame didn't believe
we were diamond merchants?

28:21.551 --> 28:26.352
Hey, man, the chick bought this
hook, line and diamond ring. Ow!

28:27.691 --> 28:30.182
What the hell was that?

28:41.738 --> 28:45.139
Oh, man. I knew it. I knew it.

28:45.175 --> 28:48.508
He should have told us
that Maynard was a nut.

28:59.056 --> 29:02.253
How was I to know he was crazy?
I never met Maynard.

29:02.292 --> 29:06.194
- And you sent us to shake him down?
- He hired me over the phone.

29:06.229 --> 29:09.562
And I never ask you to shake 'em down.
Just find 'em.

29:09.599 --> 29:11.965
- That's the thanks we get?
- Look, Rick,

29:12.002 --> 29:15.961
I am sorry that Maynard used
scare tactics to avoid paying up,

29:16.006 --> 29:18.099
but admit it, you guys blew it.

29:18.141 --> 29:20.507
We blew it? You almost got us shot.

29:20.544 --> 29:24.913
- I said I'm sorry, but you still blew it.
- Yeah, when we said we'd help.

29:24.948 --> 29:28.247
You shouldn't have taken the Ferrari.
His secretary saw me in it.

29:28.285 --> 29:33.120
Don't you think that made it just a wee bit
obvious that you are working with me?

29:33.156 --> 29:35.624
Were. Past tense.

29:35.659 --> 29:39.425
I am sitting this one out
in my own backyard where it is safe.

29:41.131 --> 29:45.033
Magnum, may I come in, please?

29:46.636 --> 29:48.604
Yes, you may come in.

29:52.275 --> 29:56.302
Magnum, I beg for a word with you.

29:56.346 --> 30:00.282
Higgins, if it's the Ferrari,
it's your fault for loaning it to them.

30:00.317 --> 30:04.617
A windscreen can be replaced.
My sanity cannot.

30:04.654 --> 30:08.055
- Why are you scrambling eggs...
- They're over easy.

30:08.091 --> 30:11.151
- Instead of looking for Tessa?
- I found him.

30:11.194 --> 30:13.958
- You found him.
- Yes, I found him.

30:15.298 --> 30:19.632
- You must take Elizabeth there.
- He threatened to kill me.

30:19.669 --> 30:22.536
To make an omelet,
one must crack a few eggs.

30:22.572 --> 30:24.096
This guy could be dangerous.

30:24.141 --> 30:28.601
Magnum, Elizabeth had the gardener
cut down the bougainvillea

30:28.645 --> 30:31.842
so she could have
an unimpaired view of the ocean.

30:31.882 --> 30:36.478
Do you know how long it took me
to cultivate that bush?

30:37.554 --> 30:42.184
11 years. 11 years of daily watering, pruning,

30:42.225 --> 30:45.194
guiding, nurturing, all by hand.

30:45.228 --> 30:48.595
I never even let Kenji near it. I did it all myself.

30:48.632 --> 30:51.897
And then with one snip of the shears, it's gone.

30:51.935 --> 30:53.926
11 years, Magnum.

30:55.505 --> 31:00.943
Magnum, I implore you, I beseech you,
take that woman to Tessa

31:00.977 --> 31:05.277
before I go irrevocably, irretrievably mad!

31:08.852 --> 31:12.481
Elizabeth, I don't think
this is such a good idea.

31:12.522 --> 31:16.288
Oh, nonsense. I'm sure
that when Dr. Tessa hears

31:16.326 --> 31:19.557
that I'm going to have an excerpt published

31:19.596 --> 31:23.464
in the Ornithologists' Digest,
he'll be quite thrilled.

31:23.500 --> 31:27.766
- He isn't the type to be thrilled.
- He was just bullying you with words.

31:27.804 --> 31:30.773
He had a double-barreled shotgun,

31:30.807 --> 31:33.469
and I was on the wrong side of a booby trap.

31:33.510 --> 31:36.070
He's probably got those all around.

31:36.112 --> 31:39.707
Instead of watchdogs. That's quite sensible.

31:39.749 --> 31:42.183
He's sure his birds are safe.

31:42.219 --> 31:47.521
I'm not worried about his birds.
I'm worried about you, and me.

31:47.557 --> 31:51.220
I'll tell you what. You wait at the road.

31:51.261 --> 31:53.991
I'll walk in there alone.

31:54.030 --> 31:58.558
He's not gonna shoot
a little old white-haired lady.

31:58.602 --> 32:03.699
I got a better idea. Why don't we
find out if Tessa is really Tessa

32:03.740 --> 32:06.709
before you take a chance like that?

32:06.743 --> 32:08.142
How?

32:13.416 --> 32:15.407
There he is.

32:19.923 --> 32:23.256
Finally, after all these years.

32:23.293 --> 32:26.854
This means so much to me, Thomas.

32:26.896 --> 32:29.888
I doubt if you'll ever know how much.

32:33.036 --> 32:35.470
That's not Tessa.

32:35.505 --> 32:37.837
- Great.
- What do you mean, great?

32:37.874 --> 32:40.672
Now we don't have to risk being shot at.

32:40.710 --> 32:43.543
- I had such hopes.
- So did Higgins.

32:43.580 --> 32:45.241
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

32:45.282 --> 32:49.048
- Don't worry. I'll find Tessa.
- Oh, I know you will.

32:49.085 --> 32:51.576
Higgins'll see to that.

33:07.737 --> 33:10.672
- Well, how did the interview go?
- Wasn't him.

33:10.707 --> 33:13.073
- What?
- It wasn't him.

33:13.109 --> 33:15.737
- What?
- Have you gone deaf, Johnny?

33:15.779 --> 33:18.680
- It wasn't him.
- It has to be him.

33:19.649 --> 33:23.608
- How could you do this to me?
- Me? I'm doing the best I can.

33:23.653 --> 33:25.985
Don't get on Thomas's back.

33:26.022 --> 33:30.220
He really thought he'd found
my elusive doctor.

33:32.262 --> 33:34.594
Come on, Merlin.

33:35.732 --> 33:37.723
Come on, baby. Come on.

33:39.169 --> 33:41.831
What idiot chained Merlin?

33:42.872 --> 33:46.171
I didn't chain him. It's just a little twine.

33:46.209 --> 33:48.074
He was eating my birds of paradise.

33:48.111 --> 33:52.241
He was probably hungry. Poor baby.

33:52.282 --> 33:54.842
Why didn't you bite him?

33:54.884 --> 33:58.752
You're right. He'd probably
give you food poisoning.

33:58.788 --> 34:03.122
See here. I've taken
all the verbal insults I intend to from you.

34:03.159 --> 34:06.253
You're right. It's time I got physical.

34:06.996 --> 34:11.194
Wait a minute. Wait.
Let's not get carried away here.

34:11.234 --> 34:13.225
- I won't, but he will.
- Ha!

34:13.268 --> 34:15.533
Higgins! Elizabeth, look.

34:15.572 --> 34:18.905
You're both upset because
I didn't find Dr. Tessa. It's my fault.

34:18.942 --> 34:22.639
You just have a cup of tea
or something and calm down.

34:22.679 --> 34:25.170
I'll figure out the next step.

34:31.554 --> 34:36.514
Well, I'm going to take Merlin for a drive.

34:36.559 --> 34:40.051
Perhaps the wind in his face
will calm him down.

34:40.096 --> 34:42.724
- Good idea.
- Magnum.

34:43.632 --> 34:48.400
Higgins, Elizabeth's taking Merlin for a ride.
Be out for a while.

34:48.438 --> 34:51.532
What he's trying to tell you, Johnny,

34:51.574 --> 34:55.772
is that I will be out of your hair
for a couple of hours.

35:09.459 --> 35:14.761
Magnum, if you don't find Tessa soon,
you'll have to call Five-O.

35:14.798 --> 35:16.993
Call Five-O? Why?

35:17.033 --> 35:21.026
If she isn't gone soon,
I am going to commit murder.

35:36.152 --> 35:39.144
- Hi, Rick.
- Quiet, Thomas. I'm up to 300 points.

35:41.991 --> 35:45.586
- You took my last beer.
- So I'll take it off your bill.

35:45.628 --> 35:47.653
Ever planning on grocery shopping?

35:47.697 --> 35:49.756
Just as soon as we find Maynard.

35:49.799 --> 35:51.562
- T.C.'s out.
- Where?

35:51.601 --> 35:55.935
Out of the deal. Didn't like
playing decoy with live ammo.

35:57.440 --> 36:02.537
Never mind. I'll do it myself.
Just as soon as I find Tessa.

36:03.179 --> 36:07.843
Fine. Just as long as T.C. and I
still get our estate privileges.

36:07.884 --> 36:11.081
- You did not find Maynard.
- No, but we got shot at.

36:11.120 --> 36:15.989
That's an occupational hazard.
Find Maynard or no privileges.

36:16.025 --> 36:20.962
I'll tell you what. I'll find
this Tessa character you're looking for.

36:20.997 --> 36:23.864
- You find Maynard.
- How you gonna do that?

36:23.900 --> 36:27.165
Simple. He's Hungarian.
I'll check with their embassy.

36:27.203 --> 36:30.639
- I'm sure they keep tabs on all their people.
- Rick.

36:30.673 --> 36:35.042
He's a refugee. They'd probably
like to get hold of him themselves.

36:38.948 --> 36:43.749
What is it? You've got that funny
little look on your face again. Thomas?

36:44.687 --> 36:47.247
Thomas, come on. What is it?

36:47.290 --> 36:50.521
Thomas!

36:53.396 --> 36:56.160
Higgins,
where's Robin's high-school annual?

36:57.467 --> 37:00.197
Higgins, where's his high-school annual?

37:00.236 --> 37:03.330
- What are you looking for?
- Elizabeth Barrett.

37:03.373 --> 37:07.332
- Are you trying to torture me?
- Where is his annual?

37:07.377 --> 37:09.368
Here.

37:09.412 --> 37:12.279
I was so worried
about Elizabeth being shot

37:12.315 --> 37:15.250
that when she said it wasn't him, I bought it,

37:15.285 --> 37:17.913
but nobody changes that much
in 25 years.

37:17.954 --> 37:22.948
I started wondering why she lied
to me, and here's the answer.

37:23.860 --> 37:26.658
- Elizabeth isn't Elizabeth.
- What?

37:26.696 --> 37:28.687
Elizabeth isn't Elizabeth.

37:30.099 --> 37:34.229
The woman who's been driving me mad
for a week is an imposter?

37:34.837 --> 37:36.634
I'm afraid so, Higgins.

37:37.607 --> 37:40.371
If she isn't Elizabeth, who is she?

37:40.410 --> 37:43.607
KGB? Hungarian secret police?
It doesn't matter.

37:43.646 --> 37:48.709
What does matter is she came here
after Tessa and I led her straight to him.

38:37.634 --> 38:40.967
Come on. There's a good boy.

38:41.004 --> 38:46.601
Yes. Come on. Good boy. Good boy.

38:55.490 --> 38:59.517
After 26 years, my pet, we've finally got him.

39:15.352 --> 39:19.361
You gotta be kidding.
That little old school teacher a KGB agent?

39:19.386 --> 39:20.478
Looks that way.

39:21.392 --> 39:24.418
She gonna kill Tessa with a ruler?

39:24.462 --> 39:27.260
Her personality is lethal enough.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.927
Far enough.

39:36.174 --> 39:40.577
- Who are you?
- My name is Elizabeth Barrett, Dr. Tessa.

39:40.611 --> 39:43.102
And guns make me very nervous.

39:44.215 --> 39:47.548
I'm a writer. Barrett's Guide to Ornithology.

39:48.853 --> 39:51.117
There's no such book.

39:51.155 --> 39:53.988
That's because it hasn't been published yet.

39:54.025 --> 39:57.188
I was hoping you would be my last chapter.

39:57.228 --> 40:01.494
Would you please put down that gun?

40:01.532 --> 40:05.127
Your macaw looks troubled.
You give him vitamin A?

40:05.169 --> 40:09.503
It's very important for macaws.
They have weak beaks without it.

40:09.540 --> 40:14.807
Believe me, Dr. Tessa,
Merlin's beak is quite strong.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.110
So are his talons.

40:23.554 --> 40:26.079
Slow it down.
We're getting too close.

40:26.124 --> 40:31.061
Anywhere on this island
is too close to that dreadful woman.

40:42.373 --> 40:45.968
There. If she hasn't killed Tessa yet,

40:46.010 --> 40:48.444
she will when she sees Higgins or me.

40:48.479 --> 40:51.243
If she's KGB, her assignment comes before

40:51.282 --> 40:53.409
personal safety or escape.

40:53.451 --> 40:57.785
I remember once in Berlin, after the war,

40:57.822 --> 40:59.483
I was in deep cover for Ml...

41:03.795 --> 41:06.263
We got a better chance
if we sneak up on 'em.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.164
In case you hadn't noticed,
this is a noisy helicopter.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.464
You'll have to let us out up here.

41:11.502 --> 41:15.336
It'll take you at least a half-hour
to hike down there.

41:15.373 --> 41:18.740
If she hasn't ripped him off yet,
she will by then.

41:18.776 --> 41:22.610
She doesn't know you. Neither does he.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.638
So?

41:25.783 --> 41:28.911
Oh, no. No way, Thomas.

41:28.953 --> 41:31.217
After she plied me
with more vodka,

41:31.255 --> 41:34.588
we rolled on the bearskin rug,

41:34.625 --> 41:39.153
she wild with passion,
while I was trying to find the microfilm.

41:39.197 --> 41:43.463
Well, I'd tell you where I found it.

41:47.205 --> 41:50.072
Propriety forbids me divulging details.

41:50.107 --> 41:54.476
Suffice it to say that within minutes,
she parted with the film and much more.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.673
Extraordinary.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.246
Thank you.

42:02.286 --> 42:08.088
And, er... how long have you been working
on this multivitamined approach?

42:09.293 --> 42:12.990
Since I first arrived in these islands in 1961.

42:13.030 --> 42:16.261
Oh. I'm always doing that.

42:16.300 --> 42:20.327
- It's so annoying.
- I can sharpen that for you.

42:20.371 --> 42:23.704
I always carry a little sharpener with me.

42:35.052 --> 42:39.352
- Who's that?
- Whoever it is, I'll get rid of him.

42:44.228 --> 42:47.197
After I finish,

42:47.231 --> 42:51.031
you can have any one you like for lunch.

42:51.068 --> 42:55.129
- Get out!
- Hey, man, that's what I'm trying to do.

42:55.172 --> 42:59.040
Get out of here.
You're frightening my birds.

42:59.076 --> 43:04.742
I got a warning light indicating chips in
my transmission. Can't fly. It's too dangerous.

43:04.782 --> 43:07.273
I don't care if you've a whole strudel in there!

43:07.318 --> 43:10.378
Get that machine off my property.

43:10.421 --> 43:13.879
Let me look at it.
You wouldn't want me to crash.

43:13.925 --> 43:17.156
I don't care,
as long as it's not in my valley.

43:28.873 --> 43:31.171
20 years I've been in this valley,

43:31.208 --> 43:36.043
and I got more trespassers
in two days than in all the 20 years.

43:37.815 --> 43:42.514
- Is he in trouble?
- He will be if he doesn't leave soon.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.449
- More tea?
- Please.

43:59.203 --> 44:01.865
Out! Get out!

44:09.580 --> 44:13.516
That's all the time I can give you, Thomas.

44:13.551 --> 44:16.543
Should have been here ten minutes ago.

44:44.015 --> 44:46.882
- I warned you.
- She's a KGB agent.

44:48.452 --> 44:50.420
- She's what?
- The man is mad.

44:50.454 --> 44:54.891
He's telling the truth.
She's a communist agent come to kill you.

44:55.793 --> 44:58.489
Dr. Tessa, drop it.

44:58.529 --> 45:01.191
You too, or I'll blow his brains out.

45:01.232 --> 45:03.894
- She'll do it anyway.
- I know.

45:03.934 --> 45:05.765
Merlin, attack.

45:16.647 --> 45:17.875
Merlin!

45:22.086 --> 45:23.610
Oops.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.714
Merlin.

45:34.665 --> 45:36.895
I hate you.

45:36.934 --> 45:39.767
The feeling, madam, is mutual.

45:42.573 --> 45:46.942
- I don't know how you did it.
- I subcontracted the job to Ice Pick.

45:46.977 --> 45:50.105
Ice Pick? What'd you offer him?

45:50.147 --> 45:52.877
You don't wanna know.

46:07.531 --> 46:09.795
Please show identification.

46:09.834 --> 46:13.463
- I wanna talk to Maynard.
- Identification, please.

46:13.504 --> 46:16.530
- You know who I am.
- Let's see.

46:16.574 --> 46:19.304
You were interested in buying a condo.

46:19.343 --> 46:21.334
Your name was Mr. Rogers?

46:22.213 --> 46:26.513
- Ah. The diamond merchant.
- Show her your ID, Thomas.

46:26.550 --> 46:29.883
- She knows who I am.
- D'you want the money?

46:37.661 --> 46:40.459
- OK, you're Magnum.
- I wanna talk to Maynard.

46:40.498 --> 46:42.830
He's not here.

46:45.136 --> 46:48.162
Let's see. That was $800 on account, right?

46:48.205 --> 46:51.333
Yeah, until I had my window blown out.

46:51.375 --> 46:54.776
Your fee, with Mr. Maynard's apology,

46:54.812 --> 46:57.474
and $500 extra on account for damages.

46:57.515 --> 47:01.611
The destruction of the window was
the action of an overprotective employee.

47:01.652 --> 47:04.120
- Who?
- Me.

47:04.155 --> 47:06.487
Next time I tell you
to stay away, stay away.

47:06.524 --> 47:10.324
You cannot go around
blowing out windows. What?

47:10.361 --> 47:14.627
- Just take the money and drop it.
- She blew a hole in the Ferrari.

47:14.665 --> 47:20.001
Haven't you had enough trouble
with tough broads for one week?

47:23.407 --> 47:26.171
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

47:28.946 --> 47:33.906
See how simple life can be
if you just control yourself, Thomas?

47:39.767 --> 47:42.418
- Thomas.
- Yes, Rick?

47:42.459 --> 47:45.053
I'm gonna kill that broad!

47:45.095 --> 47:47.086
Aha!
