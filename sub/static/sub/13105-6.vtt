(police radio chatter,
telephone ringing)

00:04.230 --> 00:05.492
BAGGED LUNCH
OR GORY EVIDENCE?

00:05.530 --> 00:07.634
I'M NOT SURE.
EW.

00:07.670 --> 00:09.638
COULD BE BOTH. FOUND IT
IN THE BACKSEAT OF MY CAR,

00:11.470 --> 00:13.335
ARE YOU SURE?

00:13.380 --> 00:14.631
FRANK WANTS TO SEE US.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.308
**

00:17.350 --> 00:19.739
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

00:19.780 --> 00:21.316
**

00:21.350 --> 00:22.419
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
WE KNEW THIS WAS COMING,

00:22.450 --> 00:24.611
SO LET'S JUST
CUT TO THE CHASE.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.084
OKAY, DIAZ IS GONE,
AND HE WON'T BE COMING BACK,

00:27.120 --> 00:28.610
WHICH MEANS I'M GONNA BE
SHORT AN OFFICER,

00:28.660 --> 00:30.059
SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU ALL
TO MAKE SURE THAT--

00:30.090 --> 00:31.227
WAIT, WAIT. I'M SORRY, SIR.

00:31.260 --> 00:32.329
CHRIS IS GONE?

00:32.360 --> 00:35.295
FRIDAY WAS HIS LAST SHIFI'.

00:35.330 --> 00:38.367
HE'S STARTING
WITH TIMMINS P.D. TODAY.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.197
HE DIDN'T WANNA MAKE
A BIG DEAL OF IT.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.730
YOU KNOW HOW DIAZ IS.

00:41.770 --> 00:47.504
LOOK, THIS JOB--
PEOPLE COME, PEOPLE GO.

00:47.540 --> 00:49.246
SO WE MIGHT AS WELL
GET USED TO IT.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.372
ALL RIGHT?
SO LET'S JUST GET OUT THERE

00:50.410 --> 00:53.345
AND DO WHAT WE'RE HERE
TO DO.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.346
**

00:58.390 --> 01:01.188
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM
AT ALL?

01:01.220 --> 01:02.756
HE DIDN'T EVEN CALL
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

01:02.790 --> 01:05.725
(indistinct conversations)

01:05.760 --> 01:07.455
(telephone ringing)

01:07.500 --> 01:09.627
OKAY, SO PAST COUPLE OF DAYS,
SILENT TREATMENT,

01:09.670 --> 01:10.864
NOT RETURNING MY TEXTS
OR PHONE CALLS,

01:10.900 --> 01:12.788
BUT THEN YOU LEAVE
ORANGE PIE IN MY CAR.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.229
IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE
TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING.

01:15.270 --> 01:16.828
THIS IS
A MAC AND CHEESE PUFF PIE,

01:16.870 --> 01:20.271
AND IT'S A LITTLE PEACE OFFERING
I MADE FOR YOU LAST NIGHT.

01:20.310 --> 01:21.402
I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY RECIPES YOU CAN MAKE

01:21.440 --> 01:22.475
WITH CHEESE PUFFS?

01:22.510 --> 01:24.842
PLEASE TELL ME IT'S JUST ONE.
(knock on WindOW)

01:24.880 --> 01:26.370
LOOK, DO YOU WANNA TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING?

01:26.420 --> 01:27.773
UH, YES, BUT--
BUT I'M ON DESK TODAY,

01:27.820 --> 01:30.539
SO I PROMISE WE'RE GONNA
TALK ABOUT THIS LATER, SO...

01:30.590 --> 01:31.784
OKAY.

01:31.820 --> 01:34.459
(door buzzes, radio chatter)

01:34.490 --> 01:36.651
OKAY, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
SIR?

01:36.690 --> 01:40.490
I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE
ABOUT MY DAUGHTER GRACIE--

01:40.530 --> 01:42.122
GRACE ALISON FINN.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.125
SHE DIDN'T COME HOME
LAST NIGHT.

01:43.170 --> 01:46.162
LOOK, I KNOW YOU HAVE RULES
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.408
BUT, PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU.
SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.135
OKAY, MY NAME IS OFFICER PECK,
AND I PROMISE

01:51.170 --> 01:52.398
I'M GONNA HELP YOU
ANY WAY I CAN.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.273
SO LET'S JUST TAKE THIS
ONE STEP AT A TIME.

01:55.310 --> 01:56.242
HOW OLD IS GRACE?

01:56.280 --> 01:59.511
UH, SHE JUST TURNED 23
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

01:59.550 --> 02:00.642
OKAY, AND HOW LONG
HAS SHE BEEN GONE?

02:00.680 --> 02:02.545
ALMOST NINE HOURS.

02:03.820 --> 02:05.185
I'M SORRY.

02:05.220 --> 02:08.348
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT HASN'T BEEN LONG ENOUGH.

02:08.390 --> 02:12.258
THEN I'LL--I'LL JUST KEEP
WAITING TILL IT IS.

02:14.330 --> 02:15.490
GOOD MORNING.

02:15.530 --> 02:17.168
WHEN WERE YOU GONNA TELL ME
YOU CHANGED THE FILING SYSTEM?

02:17.200 --> 02:19.259
I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING.

02:19.300 --> 02:20.790
NASH, I CHANGED
THE FILING SYSTEM.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.398
WELL, YOU KNOW,
ANYTHING ELSE OF JERRY'S

02:22.440 --> 02:23.338
YOU PLAN ON CHANGING,

02:23.370 --> 02:24.803
MAYBE YOU WANNA LET ME KNOW
IN ADVANCE.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.705
SORT OF THROWS ME OFF.

02:26.740 --> 02:29.379
WOW. YEAH, THE GREAT FILE DEBATE
OF 2013.

02:29.410 --> 02:30.672
YEAH, I MEAN,
YOU GUYS ARE NOT GONNA START

02:30.710 --> 02:31.938
THROWING PUNCHES, ARE YOU?
I WILL JUST...

02:31.980 --> 02:33.868
I'M SORRY. WHO ARE YOU?

02:33.920 --> 02:36.787
TRACI NASH, STEVE PECK.
GUNS AND GANGS.

02:36.820 --> 02:38.913
OH.
WE'RE HANDING OVER
A COUPLE OF CASES.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.589
I NEED YOU TO GO UPSTAIRS
AND GIVE HIY'EAHE RUNDOWN.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.724
YOU'RE GAIL'S BROTHER.
UH, IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.921
NO, WE'VE MET BEFORE, ACTUALLY,
BUT I GUESS THIS IS THE PART

02:45.960 --> 02:47.120
WHERE I SWALLOW MY PRIDE

02:47.160 --> 02:48.752
AND SAY IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU
FOR THE SECOND TIME, RIGHT?

02:48.800 --> 02:50.358
I'M STARTING TO SEE
THE FAMILY RESEMBLANCE.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.594
(chuckles) OKAY.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.858
WELL, NOW THAT WE'RE ALL
GETTING ALONG,

02:52.900 --> 02:55.664
LET'S GET A LEG UP
ON THE DAY, SHALL WE?

02:55.700 --> 02:57.463
(indistinct conversations)

02:57.510 --> 02:59.535
(siren whoops)

02:59.580 --> 03:01.400
ALL RIGHT, GET IT OUT.
COME ON.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.577
I'M FINE.

03:02.610 --> 03:04.271
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.675
'CAUSE WE GOT A JOB TO DO.
WE'RE GONNA GO DO IT.

03:05.710 --> 03:07.416
AND I DON'T NEED YOU
GOING OFF ON SOME MOE

03:07.450 --> 03:08.678
'CAUSE CHRIS DIAZ LEFI'
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.812
UNLOCK THE DOOR.

03:09.850 --> 03:14.514
WHEN YOU RIP OFF A BAND-AID,
DO YOU CALL ALL YOUR FRIENDS

03:14.560 --> 03:15.913
AND HAVE EVERYBODY COME OVER
AND WATCH,

03:15.960 --> 03:18.952
OR DO YOU JUST DO IT
AND GET IT OVER WITH?

03:18.990 --> 03:20.218
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

03:20.260 --> 03:22.364
CHRIS IS GONE.
DOESN'T MA'I'I'ER.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.265
WE HAVE A JOB TO DO,
SO LET'S DO IT.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.530
(radio chatter, alarm chirps)

03:26.570 --> 03:29.266
(door opens)

03:29.310 --> 03:31.301
DOV IS AN IDIOT.

03:31.340 --> 03:34.776
YOU KNOW,
I KINDA LIKE EPSTEIN.

03:34.810 --> 03:37.677
HE'S GOT A NERVOUS ENERGY,
BUT HE SEEMS NICE.

03:37.710 --> 03:39.678
IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU SEE A GUY
ROCKING THE BANGS.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.712
HMM. YEAH, I LIKE DUDES
WITH BANGS, YOU KNOW?

03:42.750 --> 03:43.819
IT ADDS A LITTLE MYSTERY.

03:43.850 --> 03:45.545
OKAY, SO THEN
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

03:45.590 --> 03:48.286
HE ACCUSED ME
OF BEING BIPOLAR.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.788
SOMEONE AT 15
DROPPED THEIR MEDICATION.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.024
HE JUST ASSUMED IT WAS MINE,

03:52.060 --> 03:53.596
AND INSTEAD OF ASKING ME
ABOUT IT,

03:53.630 --> 03:54.927
HE JUST BLEW ME OFF.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.791
ARE YOU SURPRISED?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:56.830 --> 03:58.491
I DON'T KNOW.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.395
MENTAL ILLNESS--
PRETTY BIG STIGMA.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.930
THROW IN A JOB WITH GUNS,
FORGET ABOUT IT.

04:01.970 --> 04:03.301
OH, I GET THAT.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.365
OKAY? WHAT I DON'T GET
IS HOW DOV THOUGHT

04:05.410 --> 04:06.900
I COULD KEEP IT A SECRET.

04:06.940 --> 04:08.009
HOW DO YOU KEEP
SOMETHING LIKE THAT

04:08.040 --> 04:09.678
FROM SOMEONE
YOU WANNA BE WITH?

04:09.710 --> 04:13.373
ANYWAYS, I JUST--I DON'T--
I DON'T DIG LABELS, YOU KNOW?

04:13.420 --> 04:14.819
I THINK EVERYONE
IS A LITTLE MESSED UP

04:14.850 --> 04:16.408
IN THEIR OWN WAY, OKAY?

04:16.450 --> 04:18.941
IT'S WHAT MAKES THE WORLD
SO INTERESTING.

04:18.990 --> 04:21.515
BOYS ARE STUPID.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.929
SO WEIRD THAT CHRIS
JUST DISAPPEARED LIKE THAT.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.689
YEAH, I ALWAYS KINDA
LIKED DIAZ.

04:28.730 --> 04:31.597
DIDN'T YOU TWO HAVE A HUGE FEUD
OVER GAIL LAST YEAR?

04:31.630 --> 04:33.837
WHICH I WON, THUS I ALWAYS
KINDA LIKED DIAZ.

04:33.870 --> 04:37.601
OH. WELL... CONGRATULATIONS.
WHAT A PRIZE.

04:37.640 --> 04:38.766
OOH, SINGLE LIFE
GETTING YOU DOWN, MCNALLY?

04:38.810 --> 04:40.505
(chuckles)
YOU SEEM A LITTLE TENSE.

04:40.540 --> 04:41.677
OH, DO I?
MM-HMM.

04:41.710 --> 04:44.406
WELL, I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN BETTER.

04:44.450 --> 04:48.045
REALLY, ACTUALLY. I'M, UM...
I'M HAPPY.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.311
CALM, EVEN--MAN ON HOOD.
WHAT?

04:51.350 --> 04:53.454
MAN ON HOOD!
(shouting indistinctly)

04:53.490 --> 04:56.653
(tires peal)
UH, 15-05. WE'RE WESTBOUND
ON LAKES ROW, UH,

04:56.690 --> 04:59.397
IN PURSUIT OF A CAB. IT APPEARS
TO HAVE STRUCK A_PEDESTRIAN.
(Siren walling)

04:59.430 --> 05:00.556
(static crackles)

05:01.860 --> 05:04.090
(siren whoops)

05:04.130 --> 05:05.825
WHOA.
UHH!

05:05.870 --> 05:06.962
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
YOU'RE GARBAGE!

05:07.000 --> 05:08.695
YOU ARE NOTHING BUT FILTH!
YOU HEAR ME?!
HEY! HEY!

05:08.740 --> 05:09.900
STAY BACK.
YOU JUMPED ONTO THE CAR, MAN.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.760
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

05:11.810 --> 05:12.902
IT WOULDN'T STOP.
THE BRAKES KEPT SEIZING UP.
HE'S A THIEF.

05:12.940 --> 05:14.578
WAIT. SO THIAI'OCAB'S YOURS?

05:14.610 --> 05:16.407
HE'S JUST SOME GAS JOCKEY WHO
SHOULD MIND HIS OWN BUSINESS.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.077
OH, YOU SHUT YOUR FACE,
OR I'LL SHUT IT FOR YOU.

05:18.110 --> 05:21.614
YEAH.
EVERYBODY, SHUT UP TILL
WE FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

05:21.650 --> 05:23.811
(radio chatter)
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:23.850 --> 05:25.408
THAT KID COMES INTO MY STORE
EVERY WEEK

05:25.450 --> 05:26.382
AND STEALS FROM ME.

05:26.420 --> 05:28.115
I CALL YOU GUYS,
AND WHAT DO YOU DO? NOTHING.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.821
TODAY I SEE HIM
IN THE FRONT SEAT OF A CAB,

05:29.860 --> 05:32.522
AND I KNOW IT'S NOT HIS,
SO I TRY TO STOP HIM.

05:32.560 --> 05:33.390
GO BACK TO COUNTING CHANGE,
BRO.

05:33.430 --> 05:34.829
KEY WAS IN THE IGNITION.
DOOR WAS OPEN.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.794
(scoffs)
I DIDN'T BREAK
INTO ANYTHING, OKAY?

05:36.830 --> 05:38.058
THERE'S AN EASY WAY
TO SOLVE THIS.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.965
YOUR GAS STATION
HAVE SECUYREIA-H CAMERAS?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.059
SCREW YOU, MAN. I'M UNDERAGE.
THEY CAN'T DO SQUAT.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.705
OH, YEAH. SCREW ME?
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. SCREW YOU.
OKAY, OKAY.

05:44.740 --> 05:48.506
SCREW YOU.
OKAY! THANK YOU.
YOU'VE BOTH BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

05:48.540 --> 05:50.508
OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.
COME WITH ME.

05:50.550 --> 05:51.903
KID LIFTED IT
FROM THE PARKING LOT

05:51.950 --> 05:54.373
OF AN I.V.A. GAS STATION,
TOOK IT FOR A JOYRIDE.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.012
(Frank) OKAY,
SO KID TAKES IT FOR A RIDE.

05:56.050 --> 05:58.086
ACCIDENTALLY HITS
A GOOD SAMARITAN.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.883
YOU GOT THE KID.
WHY AM I LOOKING AT THIS?

05:59.920 --> 06:01.956
THIS IS THE SAME TAPE,
EIGHT HOURS EARLIER.
(keyboard keys CIICK)

06:01.990 --> 06:05.448
TRYING TO FIND THE REAL OWNER OF
THE CAB SO HE CAN EXPLAIN THIS.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.822
FEMALE, OUT COLD,
LIGHT BROWN HAIR, IN HER 20$.

06:07.860 --> 06:10.567
WE NEVER SEE MUCH OF THE GUY.
WELL, LET'S SEE IF THERE'S

06:10.600 --> 06:12.465
ANY MISSING PERSONS REPORTS
ON FILE.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.695
IF ANYTHING, UH, RINGS A BELL,
WE'LL MOVE ON.

06:14.740 --> 06:16.503
YES, SIR.

06:16.540 --> 06:17.905
MCNALLY, WHAT IS IT?
YOU HAVE A LOOK.

06:17.940 --> 06:19.032
I JUST RAN THE CAB.

06:19.070 --> 06:21.573
TRACED IT BACK TO IMPOUND.
IT WAS FORMERLY EVIDENCE.

06:21.610 --> 06:22.975
WHAT CASE?

06:23.010 --> 06:24.705
ROSS PERIK.

06:24.750 --> 06:27.446
IT WAS REGISTERED TO ROSS PERIK
RIGHT BEFORE HE WAS ARRESTED

06:27.480 --> 06:31.416
FOR THE MURDER
OF DETECTIVE BARBER.

06:34.090 --> 06:35.978
THANKS FOR COMING.
OF COURSE.
WHERE ARE WE AT?

06:36.020 --> 06:37.624
CAB'S IN FORENSICS.

06:37.660 --> 06:40.493
GIRL'S NAME IS
GRACE ALISON FINN, 23.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.828
FATHER REPORTED HER MISSING
THIS MORNING.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.997
I.D.'d HER
OFF THE SECURITY FOOTAGE.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.737
PULLED PECK FROM THE CASE.
NASH IS UP IN GUNS AND GANGS,

06:47.770 --> 06:49.192
AND I INTEND
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.037
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

06:51.070 --> 06:51.866
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

06:51.910 --> 06:54.572
YOU WANNA PULL HIM,
GO AHEAD, BUT...

06:54.610 --> 06:58.649
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
HE'S GONNA WORK IT ANYWAY.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.045
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE HAVE,

07:00.080 --> 07:02.913
BUT WE KNOW THAT GRACE FINN
WAS ABDUCTED THIS MORNING

07:02.950 --> 07:06.113
IN A CAB PREVIOUSLY REGISTERED
TO INMATE ROSS PERIK.

07:06.150 --> 07:10.951
WE ALSO KNOW THAT PERIK IS
LOCKED AWAY IN MILLBURN PRISON.

07:10.990 --> 07:13.129
TEN MONTHS AGO, HE ABDUCTED
ONE OF OUR OFFICERS

07:13.160 --> 07:15.128
DURING
AN UNDERCOVER ASSIGNMENT

07:15.160 --> 07:17.822
AND HELD HER CAPTIVE
IN HIS BASEMENT.

07:17.870 --> 07:20.737
IN THE PROCESS...

07:20.770 --> 07:23.568
IN THE PROCESS OF LOCATING HER,
JERRY BARBER,

07:23.610 --> 07:25.965
A DETECTIVE FROM THIS DIVISION,
WAS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY.

07:26.010 --> 07:28.604
(officers murmuring)

07:28.640 --> 07:33.111
OKAY, PERIK'S M.O. WAS
HE LIKED BLONDES, MID 20$.

07:33.150 --> 07:35.812
PICKED THEM UP AS A CAB DRIVER.
HE DRUGGED THEM.

07:35.850 --> 07:38.114
KEPT THEM ALIVE IN HIS BASEMENT
FOR 24 HOURS.

07:38.150 --> 07:39.617
SO WE'RE DEALING
WITH A COPYCAT?

07:39.660 --> 07:41.616
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.
GRACE FINN FITS HIS PROFILE,

07:41.660 --> 07:42.786
BUT THE CAB
COULD BE A COINCIDENCE,

07:42.830 --> 07:44.752
SO RIGHT NOW IT'S WIDE OPEN.

07:44.790 --> 07:45.950
EITHER WAY,
IT'S STILL A MISSING GIRL.

07:45.990 --> 07:48.925
WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT IT?
COLLINS, TAKE OVER FOR PECK.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.622
TALK TO GRACE'S FATHER,
SEE WHAT YOU CAN GET.

07:51.670 --> 07:54.696
I WANT ALL OTHER UNIFORMS
CANVASSING THE AREA

07:54.740 --> 07:55.798
WHERE THE CAB WAS DROPPED.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.104
AND FOR NOW, WE'RE GONNA KEEP
THE PERIK CONNECTION

07:58.140 --> 08:00.199
TO OURSELVES UNTIL
WE'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE.

08:00.240 --> 08:03.573
IF YOU FIND SOMETHING,
YOU COME DIRECTLY TO ME

08:03.610 --> 08:05.202
OR DETECTIVE SWAREK.

08:05.250 --> 08:08.117
GRACE FINN WAS ABDUCTED
AT 2:04 AM. THIS MORNING,

08:08.150 --> 08:09.742
WHICH MEANS WE'RE DEALING
WITH A COPYCAT.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.611
WE'VE GOT 12 HOURS.
LET'S GO FIND HER.

08:12.660 --> 08:15.015
(indistinct conversations)

08:15.060 --> 08:17.028
CALLAGHAN, DO YOU MIND
RUNNING THIS THING?

08:17.060 --> 08:19.551
I'LL--I'LL GRAB MCNALLY
AND TAKE HER TO THE IMPOUND YARD

08:19.600 --> 08:21.192
AND FIGURE OUT
WHO BOUGHT THE CAB.
YEAH.

08:21.230 --> 08:23.027
OKAY. I'D JUST RATHER
BE OUT ON THE STREET.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.264
YEAH, SURE.
THAN KS.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.892
MCNALLY?

08:34.310 --> 08:36.005
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU SAID
GRACE LEFT FOR A RUN

08:36.040 --> 08:37.541
SOMETIME AFTER MIDNIGHT.

08:37.580 --> 08:39.639
YOU SURE ABOUT THE TIME?
YEAH.

08:39.680 --> 08:42.786
I MEAN, I THINK SO.
I WAS... I GOT HOME LATE.

08:42.820 --> 08:45.709
SHE WAS HEADING OUT
AS I WAS COMING IN.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.752
(sighs) DIDN'T EVEN
GET To TALK TO HER.

08:47.790 --> 08:49.087
MIDNIGHT'S PRETTY LATE
FOR A JOG.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.621
LOOK,
IF YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME

08:50.660 --> 08:52.992
THAT I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED HER,
SAVE YOUR BREATH,

08:53.030 --> 08:54.054
'CAUSE I ALREADY KNOW--

08:54.100 --> 08:55.988
THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT.
WE JUST NEED TO TALK THROUGH

08:56.030 --> 08:56.962
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED,
ALL RIGHT?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.696
I'VE ALREADY GONE OVER THIS
WITH OFFICER PECK.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.765
DON'T YOU GUYS
TALK TO EACH OTHER?

09:01.800 --> 09:03.859
OFFICER, TELL HIM, ALL RIGHT?

09:03.910 --> 09:05.707
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
DO THIS AGAIN.

09:05.740 --> 09:08.607
I'M SORRY. I'M NOT ON THE CASE
ANYMORE. I'VE BEEN REASSIGNED.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.699
MY DAUGHTER'S CASE
ISN'T IMPORTANT ENOUGH?

09:10.750 --> 09:12.877
LOOK, LAST YEAR
AN OFFICER FROM THIS DIVISION

09:12.920 --> 09:15.878
WENT MISSING, AND...
WE BROUGHT HER HOME, 50--

09:15.920 --> 09:17.046
SO WHAT?!

09:17.090 --> 09:20.253
THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

09:20.290 --> 09:23.259
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER
OUT THERE.

09:23.290 --> 09:26.919
I GUESS TO YOU,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.190
JUST ANOTHER FACE
ON YOUR WALL.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.995
(Nick) SIR. SIR?
WAIT A MINUTE.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.769
(Steve) OKAY.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.698
I BELIEVE MY WORK HERE
IS DONE, DETECTIVE,

09:39.740 --> 09:43.244
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'M GONNA HEAD BACK DOWNSTAIRS.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.349
YOU OKAY?

09:44.380 --> 09:45.847
UH, YEAH. THAT WAS FRANK.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.644
HE SAID I COULD BORROW YOU
FOR THE FULL DAY, SO...

09:48.680 --> 09:49.817
DO I HAVE A CHOICE?

09:49.850 --> 09:50.885
NOT REALLY,
BUT ON THE POSITIVE,

09:50.920 --> 09:52.217
I GOT ONE OF THOSE FACES--

09:52.250 --> 09:53.979
YOU KNOW, IT GETS BETTER
THE LONGER YOU LOOK AT IT.

09:54.020 --> 09:55.612
SO IT'S A WIN-WIN
FOR BOTH OF US.

09:55.660 --> 09:57.025
OKAY.

09:57.060 --> 09:59.221
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing)

09:59.260 --> 10:01.353
(sighs)

10:01.400 --> 10:05.996
MORT BARO, KYLE ZEE, IGGY WELLS.

10:06.030 --> 10:07.759
MEET GARY ALVA.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.939
OKAY, NOW THESE THREE
ARE IN POLICE CUSTODY

10:09.970 --> 10:12.700
FOR GUN TRAFFICKING, BUT WE GOT
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT

10:12.740 --> 10:14.628
GARY'S THE HEAD HONCHO.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.430
LET ME GUESS.
NONE OF THEM WILL FLIP.

10:15.480 --> 10:16.799
YEAH. WE HAVE
A COUPLE OF LEADS,

10:16.850 --> 10:18.875
BUT NOTHING THAT STICKS.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.844
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU CAN WALK THROUGH WITH ME

10:20.880 --> 10:21.847
AND SHOW ME YOUR MOVES?

10:21.880 --> 10:23.245
MY MOVES?

10:23.290 --> 10:24.689
YEAH.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.119
UNLESS YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY.

10:26.150 --> 10:28.152
THIS IS GUNS AND GANGS,
SWEETHEART.

10:28.190 --> 10:30.249
IT'S NOT THE DOWNSTAIRS RODEO
YOU'RE USED TO, HUH?

10:30.290 --> 10:34.056
GIVE ME THE FILE.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.365
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
I NEED YOU TO STEP BACK, OKAY?
UH, SURE.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.265
STRAIGHT BACK TO
THE OTHER SIDEWALK, ALL RIGHT?

10:39.300 --> 10:41.860
SORRY, I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP
AN EYE ON MY DAUGHTER.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.902
MYA, HONEY,
NOT SO CLOSE!

10:43.940 --> 10:45.168
IT'S LIKE TALKING
TO A WALL.

10:45.210 --> 10:46.837
_ YEAH.
(Siren whoops)

10:46.880 --> 10:49.178
SO, UH, IS IT TRUE?
IS THERE ANOTHER GIRL MISSING?

10:49.210 --> 10:52.043
UH...
YOU FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

10:52.080 --> 10:53.149
WE LIVE AROUND THE CORNER.
UH-HUH.

10:53.180 --> 10:54.215
I'M PART
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.217
SO IF THERE'S
SOMETHING GOING ON,

10:55.250 --> 10:56.842
YOU KNOW,
WE NEED TO KNOW.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.141
ALL RIGHT,
MR. NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.

10:58.190 --> 11:00.750
(cell phone buttons clicking)

11:00.790 --> 11:02.109
THIS GIRL WENT MISSING
FROM THIS PARKING LOT,

11:02.160 --> 11:05.027
2:00 AM. THIS MORNING.
YOU SEE ANYTHING?
I WAS IN BED BY 11:00.

11:05.060 --> 11:08.188
OH. WELL... IT'S GOOD TO KNOW
YOU GOT IT COVERED.

11:08.230 --> 11:10.095
HAVE A NICE DAY.

11:10.130 --> 11:13.190
(car engine starts)

11:13.240 --> 11:14.468
(man) YEAH, I'M LOOKING INTO IT
RIGHT NOW.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.467
EPSTEIN...

11:15.500 --> 11:17.104
(siren whoops)
YOU GOTTA GO EASY.

11:17.140 --> 11:19.358
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LUNCH IS ON ME TODAY.

11:19.410 --> 11:20.399
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

11:20.440 --> 11:21.907
OH, THANK YOU,
BUT I'M GOOD.

11:21.940 --> 11:23.749
TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I'M NOT EVEN THAT HUNGRY.

11:23.780 --> 11:28.808
OKAY. GOOD.
I'M NOT HUNGRY EITHER.

11:36.790 --> 11:39.156
IT'S GONNA TAKE A BIT
TO LOCATE THE RECORDS.

11:39.190 --> 11:40.851
COMPUTER GUY
JUST WENT ON LUNCH,

11:40.900 --> 11:42.128
BUT THEY'RE CALLING HIM.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.764
LUNCH. GREAT.
DID YOU TELL HIM

11:43.800 --> 11:44.926
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN INVESTIGATION?

11:44.970 --> 11:47.131
WE GOT A MISSING GIRL
AND A CAB THAT TRACES BACK TO--

11:47.170 --> 11:48.432
YES, I TOLD THEM.

11:48.470 --> 11:51.132
IT'S JUST GONNA BE
A FEW MINUTES.

11:55.910 --> 11:57.047
SAM...

11:57.080 --> 11:58.172
WHAT?

11:59.480 --> 12:00.447
(sighs) NOTHING.
WHAT?

12:00.480 --> 12:01.447
NOTHING. I JUST--

12:01.480 --> 12:05.189
OKAY, NO, NO, NO.
NOT TODAY, MCNALLY, OKAY?

12:05.220 --> 12:07.859
OKAY.
I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE--

12:07.890 --> 12:09.312
I CHOSE YOU SO WE WOULDN'T
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

12:09.360 --> 12:10.918
WE WERE PARTNERED THAT DAY,

12:10.960 --> 12:13.292
WHICH MEANS I DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING, OKAY?

12:13.330 --> 12:15.298
WE CLEAR?
CRYSTAL.

12:15.330 --> 12:17.764
HEY, HEY.
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD LUNCH?

12:17.800 --> 12:19.427
WE NEED TO KNOW
WHO BOUGHT THAT CAB.

12:19.470 --> 12:21.028
WE NEED A NAME, PLEASE.

12:21.070 --> 12:24.904
YEP. I GOT IT.

12:24.940 --> 12:26.032
GOOD.

12:26.070 --> 12:26.832
(cell phone beeps)

12:26.880 --> 12:28.279
SWAREK AND MCNALLY
JUST GOT A LEAD

12:28.310 --> 12:29.777
ON THE GUY
WHO BOUGHT THE CAB.

12:29.810 --> 12:30.799
THEY'RE GONNA GO
PICK HIM UP NOW.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.203
WELL, IT'S A START.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.047
FORENSICS FOUND RESIDUE
IN THE CAB,

12:34.080 --> 12:35.547
TRACE AMOUNTS OF KETAMINE
AND A.C.P.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.844
(sighs)
WHAT?

12:37.890 --> 12:39.187
LUKE?

12:39.220 --> 12:41.450
PERIK USED KETAMINE AND A.C.P.
TO SEDATE HIS VICTIMS.

12:41.490 --> 12:43.321
WE NEVER RELEASED THAT
TO THE PUBLIC.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.453
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO KNEW THAT
ARE THE POLICE AND PERIK.

12:45.490 --> 12:48.027
ALL RIGHT, SO MAYBE OUR GUY'S
HAD CONTACT WITH HIM.

12:48.060 --> 12:50.426
I'LL CALL MILLBURN, SEE IF
I CAN SCHEDULE A SIT-DOWN.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.494
A SIT-DOWN WITH WHO?
PERIK.

12:51.530 --> 12:53.361
LOOK, IF WE GOT A COPYCAT
OUT THERE RUNNING AROUND,

12:53.400 --> 12:56.563
HE EITHER GOT HIS INFORMATION
FROM US OR FROM PERIK.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.431
IF ANYBODY'S GOT A BETTER IDEA,
I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT.

12:58.470 --> 13:00.108
(cell phone beeps)

13:00.140 --> 13:03.041
MOSES KELLIE,
APARTMENT 307.

13:03.080 --> 13:07.016
**

13:07.050 --> 13:08.574
10 BUCKS THIS IS OUR GUY.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.588
**

13:10.620 --> 13:12.281
UNKNOWN DANGER?

13:12.320 --> 13:14.049
WE HAD TO GO IN.

13:14.090 --> 13:15.580
(holsters click)

13:15.620 --> 13:17.053
(whimpers)

13:17.090 --> 13:18.182
RIGHT.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.118
(doorknob clicks)

13:20.160 --> 13:22.526
**

13:22.560 --> 13:25.495
(blues rock music
blaring loudly)

13:40.320 --> 13:42.140
SAM?

13:45.150 --> 13:48.916
(plastic crinkles)

13:48.960 --> 13:50.928
**

13:50.960 --> 13:52.996
OH.

13:53.030 --> 13:54.190
(mouths words)

13:54.230 --> 13:56.198
(static crackles)
UM... THIS IS McNALLY.

13:56.230 --> 13:57.458
CAN I PLEASE GET
AN AMBULANCE

13:57.500 --> 14:00.867
TO APARTMENT 3-0-7,
423 BELLEVUE?

14:00.900 --> 14:04.461
(The British Columbians'
"Evil in the Pines" playing)

14:04.510 --> 14:09.209
**

14:09.240 --> 14:12.346
(banging in distance)

14:12.380 --> 14:20.412

(banging continues)

14:22.660 --> 14:27.393

14:27.430 --> 14:32.493
(banging continues)

14:32.530 --> 14:34.896
MOSES KELLIE!

14:34.940 --> 14:36.430
MOSES KELLIE!

14:36.470 --> 14:40.099

14:40.140 --> 14:41.505
MOSES KELLIE!

14:41.540 --> 14:46.409
**

14:46.450 --> 14:48.645
I'M GONNA TELL YOU ONE TIME,
DROP THE KNIFE!

14:48.680 --> 14:51.478
(knife clatters)
PUT YOUR HANDS UP!

14:51.520 --> 14:54.284
**

14:57.360 --> 14:59.089
(foreign accent) I ALREADY
TOLD YOU, I'M A BUSINESS OWNER.

14:59.130 --> 15:00.688
NOTHING MORE. I BOUGHT THE CAB
AND I SOLD IT.

15:00.730 --> 15:02.391
END OF STORY.
BUSINESS OWNER?

15:02.430 --> 15:04.466
MURDERABILIA.

15:04.500 --> 15:07.060
KELLIE'S GOT A WEB SITE.

15:07.100 --> 15:10.069
SELLS ARTICLES FROM
REAL LIFE MURDERS FOR PROFIT.

15:10.110 --> 15:13.534
(scoffs) 100% LEGAL.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.434
GOD BLESS THE CONSTITUTION.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.108
THE GUY YOU SOLD IT TO--
DID HE COME AND PICK IT UP?

15:18.150 --> 15:20.118
NO. I DROPPED IT OFF
AT A PARKING LOT

15:20.150 --> 15:24.541
NEAR COLLEGE STREET--
THE ONE BESIDE THE LIBRARY.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.150
(sighs)
I JUST DON'T REALLY LIKE

15:27.190 --> 15:30.421
PEOPLE COMING DIRECTLY
TO MY HOME, YOU SEE?

15:30.460 --> 15:32.155
YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL.

15:32.190 --> 15:34.329
SO DID YOU GET A LOOK
AT HINSOFACE?

15:34.360 --> 15:38.569
I LEFT THE CAB THERE,
AND THEN I LEFT.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.592
LOOK, YOU DON'T REALLY
HAVE ANYTHING ON ME, DO YOU?

15:41.640 --> 15:44.165
I MEAN, I GOT AN ALIBI
FOR LAST NIGHT, AND THIS CAB--

15:44.210 --> 15:46.462
I DON'T HAVE IT ANYMORE.
MEANS I CAN GO.

15:46.510 --> 15:49.035
OH, YOU CAN GO.
YOU JUST CAN'T GO HOME.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.502
YOU KNOW YOUR DAD NEEDED
AN AMBULANCE

15:50.550 --> 15:52.370
TO TAKE HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.514
IT TURNS OUT
HE WAS A LITTLE DEHYDRATED.

15:54.550 --> 15:59.010
YEAH, WELL,
KARMA IS A BITCH, DETECTIVE.

15:59.050 --> 16:00.711
HE'S A BIG BOY, MY OLD MAN.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.354
HUH. OKAY. EXCEPT YOU'RE
HIS LEGAL GUARDIAN,

16:03.390 --> 16:05.529
WHICH MEANS
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.290
THAT PUTS YOU ON THE HOOK
FOR ABUSE, NEGLECT.

16:08.330 --> 16:09.490
THAT'S A HEAW SENTENCE.

16:09.530 --> 16:10.997
THIS MUST BE A JOKE.

16:12.770 --> 16:14.294
JUST THINK OF ALL
THE CONTACTS YOU'LL MAKE

16:14.340 --> 16:15.295
FOR YOUR BUSINESS.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.529
YOU'RE RIGHT, MOSES.

16:18.570 --> 16:21.004
KARMA IS A BITCH.
(door buzzes and beeps)

16:22.680 --> 16:24.705
PLEASE TELL ME YOU GOT
SOMETHING ON KELLIE.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.742
SOLID ALIBI. SOLD THE CAB
WITH AN ONLINE ACCOUNT

16:27.780 --> 16:29.338
TO AN UNDISCLOSED BUYER.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.780
HE'S GARBAGE, BUT NOT
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

16:31.820 --> 16:33.117
WE SENT THE I.P.
OF THE ONLINE ACCOUNT

16:33.160 --> 16:34.354
OFF TO TECH DESK.

16:34.390 --> 16:36.358
IT'S ENCRYPTED,
BUT THEY'RE WORKING ON IT.

16:36.390 --> 16:37.721
OKAY. SO WE KEEP GOING.

16:37.760 --> 16:40.354
WHAT'S THIS?

16:40.400 --> 16:41.389
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
GRACE FINN'S ROUTE LAST NIGHT.

16:41.430 --> 16:42.624
THINK SHE WAS GRABBED
ALONG HERE.

16:42.660 --> 16:44.298
THAT'S WHERE
THE CAB WAS DROPPED.

16:44.330 --> 16:45.627
SO WE THINK
HE LIVES IN THIS AREA.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.228
JUST WAITING TO HEAR BACK
FROM THE OFFICERS

16:47.270 --> 16:49.238
WORKING THE STREETS.
CALLAGHAN.

16:49.270 --> 16:50.339
JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH MILLBURN.

16:50.370 --> 16:52.065
PERIK'S WILLING TO TALK.

16:52.110 --> 16:54.635
WHAT? WHEN DID YOU GUYS
DECIDE TO TALK TO HIM?

16:54.680 --> 16:57.376
LOOK, WITH THE DRUG RESIDUE
WE FOUND IN THE CAB,

16:57.410 --> 16:58.502
IT GIVES ME REASON
TO BELIEVE

16:58.550 --> 17:01.610
THAT PERIK'S HAD CONTACT
WITH OUR GUY.

17:01.650 --> 17:03.208
I'M ON MY WAY.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.218
DON'T BOTH ER.
WHY?

17:05.250 --> 17:07.616
PERIK WILL ONLY AGREE TO
AN INTERVIEW ON ONE CONDITION.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.616
HAS TO BE PECK.

17:09.660 --> 17:12.220
OKAY, NOW WE KEEP THIS QUIET
FOR NOW UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT

17:12.260 --> 17:13.750
HOW TO GET AROUND THE ISSUE.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.121
I WANT PECK KEPT AWAY FROM IT,
UNDERSTOOD?

17:16.160 --> 17:17.366
(Gail)
KEPT AWAY FROM WHAT?

17:19.830 --> 17:21.536
I ASSIGNED YOU
TO OTHER DUTIES,

17:21.570 --> 17:22.491
TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY
FROM THIS.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.633
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO IN?
BECAUSE I CAN DO IT.

17:24.670 --> 17:27.537
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THE GUY'S PLAYING WITH US.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.174
YOU CAN HEAD BACK
TO YOUR DESK.

17:35.380 --> 17:37.211
I'LL DO IT. I'LL GO IN.

17:37.250 --> 17:39.787
YEAH. NO, THANKS.
WE NEED PERIK ALIVE. FRANK--

17:39.820 --> 17:43.221
NO, LUKE. IAM NOT
SENDING HER IN THERE,

17:43.260 --> 17:44.488
NOT AFTER WHAT HE DID
TO HER.

17:46.530 --> 17:50.318
LOOK, THESE ARE
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.429
WE WANNA HELP
AS MUCH AS WE CAN.

17:52.470 --> 17:53.562
(door buzzes)

17:53.600 --> 17:56.364
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,
PERIK'S BEEN A MODEL PRISONER.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.765
SO GLAD TO HEAR IT.

17:57.810 --> 17:58.868
HERE YOU GO.

17:58.910 --> 18:02.505
THIS IS THE LAST FOUR MONTHS
OF VISITOR LOGS, VIDEO.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.577
WE'VE RECORDED EVERY VISITATION
AND INTERVIEW.

18:05.610 --> 18:06.645
WAIT. THIS IS ONLY FOUR MONTHS?

18:06.680 --> 18:08.409
GUY LIKE THIS
DRAWS A CROWD.

18:08.450 --> 18:09.712
HE'S HAD FOUR LAWYERS
SINCE HE GOT HERE,

18:09.750 --> 18:11.809
EACH WITH A TEAM
OF ASSOCIATES.

18:11.850 --> 18:13.852
THEN THERE'S THE PSYCHOLOGISTS,
PSYCHIATRISTS,

18:13.890 --> 18:16.415
JOURNALISTS,
CRIMINOLOGY STUDENTS.

18:16.460 --> 18:17.529
I'LL SEND OVER
THE EARLIER STUFF

18:17.560 --> 18:18.584
AS SOON AS WE GET IT
OUT OF RECORDS.

18:18.630 --> 18:19.756
THIS IS GONNA TAKE WEEKS.

18:19.790 --> 18:21.519
IT CAN'T.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.562
GET IT OVER TO 15.
HAND IT OVER TO SWAREK.

18:25.870 --> 18:27.269
(door buzzes)

18:32.440 --> 18:35.432
DETECTIVE CALLAGHAN.
WHERE'S GAIL?

18:35.480 --> 18:36.572
SHE'S BUSY.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.577
GRACE ALISON FINN.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.282
ABDUCT ED EARLY
THIS MORNING.

18:46.950 --> 18:49.259
OH.

18:49.290 --> 18:50.928
OH, LET ME GUESS.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.825
SHE WAS PICKED UP
IN MY OLD CAB,

18:52.860 --> 18:56.227
AND SHE WAS DRUGGED
WITH KETAMINE AND A.C.P.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.261
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

18:59.570 --> 19:01.731
DO YOU KNOW
WHO'S DOING THIS?

19:01.770 --> 19:03.909
WELL, I KNOW I WAS LOCKED UP
TIGHT IN MY CELL LAST NIGHT,

19:03.940 --> 19:04.907
SO IT WASN'T ME.

19:04.940 --> 19:07.636
ROSS, PLEASE.
IF YOU KNOW WHO'S DOING THIS...

19:07.680 --> 19:09.932
I-IF YOU WANT MY HELP,

19:09.980 --> 19:12.642
THEN DO WHAT I ASKED.

19:12.680 --> 19:13.578
SEND OFFICER PECK.

19:13.620 --> 19:17.579
TELL HER TO WEAR
THAT LITTLE BLACK NUMBER.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.542
SHE'LL KNOW THE ONE
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

19:19.590 --> 19:20.454
CAN'T DO THAT, ROSS.

19:20.490 --> 19:24.551
WHEN EXACTLY
DID THIS GIRL GO MISSING?

19:24.590 --> 19:27.957
WHY?
I'M JUST WONDERING HOW MUCH TIME
YOU'LL HAVE LEFT TO FIND HER

19:28.000 --> 19:30.298
AND HOW MUCH MORE
YOU PLAN ON WASTING.

19:30.330 --> 19:33.390
ROSS--
PLEASE STOP CALLING ME
BY MY FIRST NAME.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.829
IT'S FACILE.
YOU CAN DO BETTER.

19:35.870 --> 19:39.465
GUARD, I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO
MY CELL NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND.

19:42.440 --> 19:43.668
(yawning) I'M SLEEPY.

19:43.710 --> 19:46.247
(door clanks)

19:46.280 --> 19:47.508
SO ONE OF GARY'S SUBSIDIES

19:47.550 --> 19:49.768
IS A J.D.'s
CASH MARKET AND LOAN.

19:49.820 --> 19:50.912
YEAH.

19:50.950 --> 19:52.508
HE'S PROBABLY USING IT
TO LAUNDER MONEY.

19:52.550 --> 19:54.654
THAT'S WHY YOUR GUYS
WON'T TALK.

19:54.690 --> 19:58.456
THEY'RE BEING PAID OFF...
OR THEIR FAMILIES ARE.

19:58.490 --> 20:01.994
SO... WE PUT A TEAM
ON CASH MARKET,

20:02.030 --> 20:04.260
WE PULL IN
WHOEVER SHOWS UP TO COLLECT,

20:04.300 --> 20:06.564
AND WE--
WE FLIP 'EM THAT WAY.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.489
I LIKE IT.
IT'S IMPRESSIVE.

20:09.540 --> 20:10.905
OH.

20:10.940 --> 20:13.534
WELL, ONE THING
I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT STILL...

20:13.580 --> 20:14.729
HMM? WHAT'S THAT?

20:14.780 --> 20:15.929
(telephone rings in distance)

20:15.980 --> 20:18.949
WHY I'M SOLVING SOMETHING I'M
PRETTY SURE YOU ALREADY KNOW.

20:18.980 --> 20:20.675
ANYONE WHO LOOKED
IN THIS FILE

20:20.720 --> 20:23.518
COULD HAVE FIGURED THIS OUT,
DETECTIVE.

20:24.850 --> 20:28.684
(sighs)
THERE'S A GIRL MISSING,

20:28.720 --> 20:31.427
AND THEY THINK THEY MAY BE
LOOKING FOR A COPYCAT.

20:31.460 --> 20:32.688
CO PYCAT?
COPYCAT OF WHO?

20:34.630 --> 20:35.824
ROSS PERIK.

20:37.970 --> 20:41.531
TRACI...

20:41.570 --> 20:43.401
LOOK, TRACI,
IF YOU GO DOWN THERE,

20:43.440 --> 20:44.759
PEOPLE'S CONCERN FOR YOU

20:44.810 --> 20:47.677
IS GONNA DISTRACT THEM
FROM STAYING ON TASK.

20:47.710 --> 20:50.770
OKAY,
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

20:50.810 --> 20:52.573
(telephone ringing in distance)

20:52.610 --> 20:55.579
(indistinct conversations)

21:01.520 --> 21:03.784
THAT COP...

21:03.830 --> 21:06.879
THE ONE THAT YOU SAID
WAS ABDUCT ED LAST YEAR...

21:06.930 --> 21:08.352
THAT WAS YOU, WASN'T IT?

21:08.400 --> 21:12.496
I HEARD SOME
OF THE GUYS TALKING.

21:12.530 --> 21:14.339
I WISH YOU'D TOLD ME THAT.

21:14.370 --> 21:15.792
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

21:15.840 --> 21:19.435
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO...
ROUGH ON YOU BACK THERE.

21:20.710 --> 21:23.804
OR MAYBE I WOULD HAVE.
I DON'T KNOW.

21:23.850 --> 21:29.675
IT'S JUST...
GRACIE'S ALL I'VE GOT.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.314
IT'S THE ONLY THING IN THE WORLD
THAT MATTERS TO ME.

21:32.350 --> 21:33.988
THE ONLY THING.

21:34.020 --> 21:38.480
AND I'M GONNA PUT MY FAITH
IN WHAT YOU SAID.

21:38.530 --> 21:39.827
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

21:39.860 --> 21:42.021
THEY FOUND YOU.

21:42.060 --> 21:43.561
THEY CAN FIND HER, TOO,
RIGHT?

21:47.000 --> 21:50.834
ANYWAY... I'M SORRY.

21:54.380 --> 21:57.304
(Luke speaking indistinctly)

21:59.380 --> 22:02.474
PECK.
YOU NEED SOMETHING?

22:02.520 --> 22:03.544
I WANNA GO IN.

22:03.590 --> 22:04.818
OKAY, BUT, GAIL--

22:04.850 --> 22:05.885
CAN YOU GUYS STOP
PROTECTING ME?

22:05.920 --> 22:08.582
THERE'S A GIRL MISSING,
AND I'M A POLICE OFFICER.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.828
SO PLEASE, JUST FOR GOD SAKES,
JUST LET ME DO MY JOB.

22:11.860 --> 22:12.758
SHE'LL BE COMPLETELY SAFE.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.599
HE'LL BE SECURED
AND CHAINED TO THE TABLE,

22:14.630 --> 22:15.597
AND THERE'S A CAMERA
IN THE CEILING

22:15.630 --> 22:17.029
THAT'S RECORDING EVERYTHING.

22:17.060 --> 22:18.721
LOOK, GAIL, IF WE DO THIS,

22:18.770 --> 22:19.794
I'LL BE RIGHT
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS.

22:19.830 --> 22:22.697
STOP SAYING "IF" AND JUST
TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO DO.

22:26.740 --> 22:27.900
(Luke) MAINTAIN EQUAL FOOTING
WITH HIM.

22:27.940 --> 22:31.671
HE'S NOT ABOVE YOU.
MAKE SURE HE FEELS THAT.

22:31.710 --> 22:34.577
HE'S GONNA TRY AND DISTRACT YOU
FROM WHY YOU'RE THERE.

22:34.620 --> 22:38.386
KEEP HIM ON TARGET.
BUILD A RAPPORT.

22:38.420 --> 22:41.685
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IS
HE'S GONNA ASK YOU QUESTIONS.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.655
ONLY GIVE HIM WHAT YOU FEEL
COMFORTABLE GIVING.

22:44.690 --> 22:46.783
THERE'S A PART
IN EVERYONE'S PSYCHE,

22:46.830 --> 22:48.457
A WEAKNESS TO BE FOUND.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.435
ALL ELSE FAILS, BE QUIET.

22:53.470 --> 22:55.563
LET HIM TALK.

22:55.600 --> 22:59.058
SOMETIMES ALL IT TAKES
IS A LITTLE SILENCE.

22:59.110 --> 23:00.065
YOU READY?

23:00.110 --> 23:02.101
YES.

23:02.140 --> 23:03.698
ANY QUESTIONS?

23:05.180 --> 23:06.738
OKAY.

23:08.950 --> 23:10.815
(door buzzes)

23:13.890 --> 23:16.108
(door closes)

23:16.160 --> 23:18.458
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU,
GAIL.

23:23.700 --> 23:26.464
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

23:26.500 --> 23:28.036
I'M RIGHT HERE.

23:28.070 --> 23:29.560
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE,
DR. PERIK.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.205
OH, THAT'S A BIT FORMAL.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.571
CALL ME "ROSS."

23:33.610 --> 23:36.101
OKAY.

23:36.140 --> 23:37.778
I'LL CALL YOU "ROSS."
I MEAN, I GUESS IT'S TRUE.

23:37.810 --> 23:39.141
YOU LOST
YOUR MEDICAL LICENSE,

23:39.180 --> 23:41.148
SO YOU'RE NOT REALLY
A DOCTOR ANYMORE.

23:41.180 --> 23:45.139
GRACE ALISON FINN,
YES, I KNOW.

23:45.190 --> 23:46.680
SHE'S VERY ATTRACTIVE.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.881
SHE WAS ABDUCT ED
WITH MY OLD CAB.

23:48.920 --> 23:51.480
WOULD YOU MIND
TURNING AROUND?

23:53.060 --> 23:54.755
NO, IT'S JUST--I-I...

23:54.800 --> 23:56.529
YOU'RE TALLER
THAN I REMEMBER.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.561
WELL, I GUESS IT'S HARD
TO GAUGE A PERSON'S HEIGHT

23:57.600 --> 23:59.090
WHEN THEY'RE TIED
TO A TABLE.

23:59.130 --> 24:00.939
(chuckles)

24:00.970 --> 24:02.597
YOU'RE ADORABLE.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.467
LOOK,
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE

24:06.510 --> 24:08.671
THAT THE MAN
WHO ABDUCTED GRACE

24:08.710 --> 24:10.075
SPOKE WITH YOU.

24:10.110 --> 24:11.839
WELL, I DO GET
A LOT OF VISITORS.

24:11.880 --> 24:14.849
UH, THE THING IS,
I CAN'T BE HELD RESPONSIBLE

24:14.880 --> 24:17.212
FOR WHAT THEY DO
IN THEIR OWN TIME.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.810
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

24:19.850 --> 24:21.989
I'M ASKING YOU TO HELP ME.

24:22.020 --> 24:25.148
ARE YOU A FAN OF JUNG?

24:25.190 --> 24:26.589
EXCUSE ME?
CARL JUNG.

24:26.630 --> 24:28.723
IT'S THE ONE UPSIDE
OF BEING IN HERE.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.558
IT'S LOTS OF TIME
TO CATCH UP ON MY READING.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.568
GRACE ALISON FINN.
SHE IS 23 YEARS OLD.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.238
SHE WENT MISSING
FROM AN I.V.A. GAS STATION

24:35.270 --> 24:37.261
AT 2:04 THIS MORNING.

24:37.300 --> 24:39.165
BRILLIANT THINKER--JUNG.

24:39.210 --> 24:44.739
HIS PRIMARY THEORY--
WE ALL HAVE A SHADOW SELF.

24:44.780 --> 24:46.247
IT'S A PART OF US
THAT'S SO UGLY,

24:46.280 --> 24:49.772
THAT WE TRY TO KEEP IT
HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE WORLD.

24:49.820 --> 24:51.242
PROBLEM IS,
THE MORE WE IGNORE IT,

24:51.290 --> 24:53.281
THE UNHAPPIER IT BECOMES.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.585
I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR
THAT YOU'RE UNHAPPY, ROSS.

24:56.620 --> 25:02.855
(scoffs) I'M SAYING THAT GUILT
IS THE BIGGEST SHADOW OF ALL.

25:02.900 --> 25:05.164
WE WEAR IT ON OUR FACE.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.122
IT AGES US.

25:07.170 --> 25:08.535
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL.

25:08.570 --> 25:09.764
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:09.800 --> 25:12.860
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

25:12.910 --> 25:14.969
NO, I'M NOT HERE
TO PLAY GAMES.

25:15.010 --> 25:18.138
ME NEITHER.

25:18.180 --> 25:20.045
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
A SECRET,

25:20.080 --> 25:23.789
SOON AS YOU TELL ME YOURS.

25:23.820 --> 25:27.654
THE STEPS OUTSIDE
THE FUNERAL HOME--

25:27.690 --> 25:29.988
YOU WERE COMING IN
WHEN I, UH--

25:30.020 --> 25:31.681
WHEN I TRIPPED,
AND YOU HELPED ME UP.

25:31.730 --> 25:32.754
YEAH.

25:32.790 --> 25:33.757
I FORGOT.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.724
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD
THIS HAS BEEN FOR YOU.

25:36.760 --> 25:41.163
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE THIS DREAM SOMETIMES

25:41.200 --> 25:44.237
WHERE MY PHONE RINGS
AND H ANSWER IT,

25:44.270 --> 25:47.979
AND ON THE OTHER LINE
IS JERRY,

25:48.010 --> 25:50.331
AND, UH, HE ASKS ME
TO MEET HIM

25:50.380 --> 25:53.349
AT THIS PLACE WHERE WE USED
TO HAVE BREAKFAST.

25:53.380 --> 25:57.248
AND I GO THERE, AND, UH,

25:57.280 --> 26:00.909
I CAN SEE HIM IN THE WINDOW.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.851
AND... BEFORE I CAN OPEN
THE DOOR, THOUGH,

26:04.890 --> 26:08.257
I WAKE UP.

26:08.300 --> 26:12.259
AND FOR A SECOND, I FORGET.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.768
THAT'S OKAY.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.734
THAT'S NORMAL.

26:16.770 --> 26:17.907
IT TAKES TIME.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.171
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
IT TAKES A LITTLE BOY

26:21.210 --> 26:26.273
TO STOP ASKING WHERE PEOPLE GO
AFTER THEY DIE?

26:26.310 --> 26:29.347
'CAUSE I DO.

26:29.380 --> 26:33.146
OR I GUESS I DON'T,
BECAUSE LEO'S STILL ASKING.

26:33.190 --> 26:35.750
(voice breaking)
I MEAN, I'M TRYING.

26:35.790 --> 26:40.659
I'M TRYING SO HARD
JUST TO KEEP GOING...

26:40.700 --> 26:42.292
(sniffles)

26:42.330 --> 26:45.219
BUT SOMETIMES...

26:47.170 --> 26:52.403
SOMETIMES ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS HOW MUCH I MISS HIM.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.305
(knocks)

26:54.340 --> 26:56.399
(dog barking in distance,
police radio chatter)

26:56.440 --> 26:58.408
HUH? HI, MA'AM.
I'M OFFICER SHAW.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.008
THIS IS OFFICER EPSTEIN.

27:00.050 --> 27:01.142
YOU'RE HERE
ABOUT THE MISSING GIRL?
UH-HUH.

27:01.180 --> 27:02.716
I WAS AT THE GAS STATION
EARLIER.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.217
I WAS OUT FOR A WALK
WITH MY DAUGHTER,

27:04.250 --> 27:06.411
AND WE NOTICED
THE POLICE CARS.

27:06.450 --> 27:08.350
YEAH, WE, UH, SPOKE WITH YOUR
HUSBAND BRIEFLY THIS MORNING.

27:08.390 --> 27:09.414
MY HUSBAND'S IN NEW YORK
THIS WEEK.

27:09.460 --> 27:11.951
KAREN AND I ARE GOING
TO VISIT HIM THIS WEEKEND.

27:11.990 --> 27:15.926
I-I'M SORRY. YOUR DAUGHTER'S
NAME IS KAREN, NOT... MYA?

27:15.960 --> 27:17.427
YES.

27:17.460 --> 27:19.860
EXCUSE US ONE SECOND.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.231
IT'S NOT HIS DAUGHTER.

27:21.270 --> 27:23.067
GUY SNOWED US RIGHT THERE.
WE LET HIM GO.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.761
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH,
MY ASS.

27:24.810 --> 27:25.629
BUT WHY?
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

27:25.670 --> 27:27.001
WHY WOULD HE COME
TO THE CRIME SCENE?

27:27.040 --> 27:28.302
WHY TALK TO COPS?

27:28.340 --> 27:30.843
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE KNEW.

27:30.880 --> 27:33.872
HE WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US,
AND WE LET HIM GO.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.138
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

27:36.180 --> 27:38.216
(telephone ringing)

27:38.250 --> 27:39.182
THIS IS A NEEDLE
IN A HAYSTACK.

27:39.220 --> 27:40.949
I MEAN, IT COULD BE
ANY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE.

27:40.990 --> 27:43.049
MCNALLY, I'M, UH, JUST
TRYING TO DO MY JOB.

27:43.090 --> 27:44.455
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE THAT
A TRY?

27:44.490 --> 27:48.699
I AM DOING MY JOB.

27:48.730 --> 27:51.426
YOU DON'T WANNA TALK? FINE.
WE DON'T HAVE TO.

27:51.470 --> 27:54.132
STOP TREATING ME LIKE
YOUR PERSONAL PUNCHING BAG.
(cell phone rings)

27:54.170 --> 27:56.297
PLEASE.
(presses key)

27:56.340 --> 27:58.968
(ﬁng)

27:59.010 --> 28:00.034
(ring, beep)

28:00.070 --> 28:01.901
OLIVER, HEY.

28:03.980 --> 28:06.847
YOU GET A NAME? OKAY, UH,
GIVE ME A DESCRIPTION.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.142
WE'LL GO THROUGH THE TAPES.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.875
SEE IF WE CAN FIND ANYONE
THAT MATCHES, YEAH?

28:11.990 --> 28:13.753
(Perik) YOU'RE STALLING.

28:13.790 --> 28:14.882
(Gail) WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

28:14.920 --> 28:17.354
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I ALREADY CLEARED IT WITH FRANK.

28:17.390 --> 28:20.359
I JUST WANNA BE HERE
WHEN SHE GETS OUT.

28:20.390 --> 28:22.893
FINE. YOU WANT A SECRET?

28:22.930 --> 28:24.090
OKAY.

28:24.130 --> 28:28.169
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER,
I USED TO SHOPLIFT--

28:28.200 --> 28:31.203
MAKEUP...
SOMETIMES EVEN CLOTH ES.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.504
OH, AND I'M THE ONE
IN JAIL?

28:33.540 --> 28:35.770
WELL, I NEVER DISCLOSED IT
ON MY POLICE APPLICATION.

28:35.810 --> 28:36.879
I...

28:36.910 --> 28:38.172
I LIED.

28:38.210 --> 28:40.269
COME ON. YOU CAN DO
BETTER THAN THAT.

28:40.310 --> 28:42.312
I WANT SOMETHING REAL,

28:42.350 --> 28:44.887
SOMETHING YOU'RE ASHAMED OF.

28:44.920 --> 28:49.357
YOU KNOW, I DO WONDER HOW
GRACE FINN IS DOING RIGHT NOW.

28:49.390 --> 28:52.086
I KILLED A CAT. OKAY?

28:52.130 --> 28:54.849
ARE YOU HAPPY, ROSS?

28:54.900 --> 28:59.428
I WAS 9 YEARS OLD, AND WE HAD
JUST GOTTEN A NEW KITTEN.

28:59.470 --> 29:02.030
AND MY BROTHER
WAS CHASING ME,

29:02.070 --> 29:05.164
SO... I RAN INTO MY BEDROOM

29:05.210 --> 29:08.179
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME.

29:10.310 --> 29:14.178
PUT IT IN A DRAWER,
BUT HE PICKED THE LOCK.

29:14.220 --> 29:17.815
AND HE GOT INTO THE ROOM...

29:17.850 --> 29:22.480
AND I SLAMMED...
THE DRAWER SHUT.

29:22.520 --> 29:23.885
SO HE WOULDN'T SEE.

29:23.930 --> 29:26.057
BUT THE CAT--

29:26.090 --> 29:29.127
LAST MOMENT HAD...

29:29.160 --> 29:32.493
SORT OF POPPED
ITS HEAD UP...

29:34.340 --> 29:36.194
AND I DIDN'T SEE IT
IN TIME.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.332
YOU SNAPPED ITS NECK?

29:37.370 --> 29:40.806
I TOLD MY PARENTS
THAT IT RAN AWAY.

29:40.840 --> 29:44.571
AND I'VE BEEN TERRIFIED
OF CATS EVER SINCE.

29:44.610 --> 29:52.187
OKAY? SO I TOLD YOU
A SECRET, ROSS,

29:52.220 --> 29:54.552
AND NOW IT'S YOUR TURN
TO TELL ME SOMETHING.

29:54.590 --> 29:58.924
WELL...

29:58.960 --> 30:00.825
THERE MIGHT BE SOMEONE.

30:00.860 --> 30:03.454
BUT I HAVEN'T SEE HIM
IN A WHILE.

30:03.500 --> 30:06.196
THE GUY'S CURIOUS...

30:06.230 --> 30:08.892
A READER.

30:08.940 --> 30:10.589
HE'S A REAL DETAIL PERSON.

30:10.640 --> 30:13.165
BUT HE'D HAVE TO BE
TO DO WHAT HE DOES.

30:13.210 --> 30:15.576
WHAT DOES HE DO?
WELL, WE'LL GET TO THAT.

30:16.940 --> 30:20.603
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR COMING,
GAIL.

30:20.650 --> 30:23.312
I'M REALLY STARTING
TO ENJOY MYSELF.

30:28.620 --> 30:30.349
SO OLIVER AND EPSTEIN
THINK HE'S OUR GUY.

30:30.390 --> 30:31.482
THEY'RE NOT SURE,
BUT HE LIED,

30:31.530 --> 30:33.589
AND HE WAS AT THE CRIME SCENE,
FISHING FOR INFORMATION.

30:33.630 --> 30:34.654
LOOK, THEY GAVE US
A DESCRIPTION,

30:34.700 --> 30:37.021
BUT SO FAR WE HAVEN'T SEEN
ANYBODY THAT MATCHES.

30:37.060 --> 30:38.163
YEAH, PERIK MENTIONED
SOMEONE.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.622
SAID HE HADN'T SEEN HIM
IN A WHILE.

30:39.670 --> 30:40.659
LOOK FURTHER BACK.

30:40.700 --> 30:45.501
SO... WE'LL START
FROM WHEN PERIK FIRST WENT IN

30:45.540 --> 30:46.939
AND WORK OUR WAY
TO THE PRESENT.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.938
LUKE, IT'S GONNA TAKE
A WHILE.

30:48.980 --> 30:50.948
VIKTOR E. FRANKL.

30:50.980 --> 30:53.403
"MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING."

30:53.450 --> 30:54.872
YOU EVER READ IT?

30:54.920 --> 30:56.410
IS THAT WHERE
THE ANSWER IS?

30:56.450 --> 30:58.145
AM I GONNA FIND IT
IN A BOOK?

30:58.190 --> 31:02.513
THE ANSWER'S
ALWAYS IN A BOOK.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.883
FRANKL WROTE IT ABOUT
HIS EXPERIENCES IN CAPTIVITY.

31:06.930 --> 31:10.252
HE BELIEVED THAT IN PERIODS
OF EXTREME DISTRESS,

31:10.300 --> 31:12.188
LOVE KEEPS US GOING.

31:12.230 --> 31:14.937
YOU MUST KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT.

31:14.970 --> 31:16.460
LOOK, HE'S NOT
GIVING HER ANYTHING.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.309
HE'S JUST GETTING OFF
ON THE ATTENTION.

31:18.340 --> 31:19.602
SOON AS ANDY AND SWAREK
HAVE A SOLID LEAD,

31:19.640 --> 31:21.278
I'LL PULL HER OUT.

31:21.310 --> 31:25.076
THE DAY YOU GOT AWAY FROM ME,

31:25.110 --> 31:28.341
WHO WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE
WHEN YOU MADE YOUR GREAT ESCAPE?

31:28.380 --> 31:30.610
MY BCgTEIERIEND.
THERE'S THAT GUILT AGAIN.

31:30.650 --> 31:33.016
TELL ME ABOUT HIM.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

31:33.050 --> 31:36.258
NICK.
THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.
YOU'RE LYING.

31:36.290 --> 31:37.587
I'M NOT LYING.
PLEASE.

31:37.620 --> 31:40.953
IT'S IN
THE BACK OF YOUR EYES,

31:41.000 --> 31:42.592
THE SHAPE OF YOUR MOUTH.

31:42.630 --> 31:46.327
YOUR SHADOW SELF,
CLAWING TO THE SURFACE,

31:46.370 --> 31:47.928
BEGGING TO BREATHE.

31:47.970 --> 31:52.464
STOP WORRYING
ABOUT THE CAMERAS, GAIL.

31:52.510 --> 31:55.206
YOU'RE HERE FOR GRACE.
WORRY ABOUT GRACE.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.468
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

31:56.510 --> 31:59.343
BECAUSE OF YOU,
I HAVE NOTHING--

31:59.380 --> 32:02.110
FOUR WALLS AND A STACK OF BOOKS.
YOU WANT MY HELP?

32:02.150 --> 32:05.449
GIVE ME SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT
WHILE I'M ROTTING AWAY IN HERE,

32:05.490 --> 32:07.287
WAITING FOR MY APPEAL.

32:10.660 --> 32:13.026
I SLEPT WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

32:13.060 --> 32:16.188
(exhales) YOU CHEATED.

32:16.230 --> 32:19.495
I DID, YEAH.
I SLEPT WITH SOMEONE ELSE

32:19.530 --> 32:23.660
TO MAKE MYSELF FEEL BETTER
BECAUSE I WAS JEALOUS.

32:23.700 --> 32:26.032
AND I LIED ABOUT IT
TO HIM.

32:26.070 --> 32:27.469
I LIED ABOUT IT
TO MY FRIENDS,

32:27.510 --> 32:29.728
AND I LIED ABOUT IT
TO MYSELF.
YOU WERE JEALOUS.

32:29.780 --> 32:32.101
WAS THERE ANOTHER WOMAN?

32:34.020 --> 32:35.373
WERE YOU REPLACED?

32:35.420 --> 32:38.218
OH, POOR GAIL.

32:38.250 --> 32:40.616
MUST BE TOUGH
BEING SECOND CHOICE.

32:40.650 --> 32:43.357
ARE YOU GONNA ANSWER ME?

32:43.390 --> 32:45.756
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, GAIL?

32:45.790 --> 32:48.327
WH-WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
GAIL? OFFICER PECK--

32:48.360 --> 32:51.488
NO, YOU ARE NOT GONNA TELL ME
WHERE GRACE FINN IS

32:51.530 --> 32:53.418
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT
YOUR CRIME.

32:53.470 --> 32:55.358
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO CONFESS TO ME.

32:55.400 --> 32:58.198
YOU'RE JUST A GUY
CHAINED TO A TABLE.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.105
I GUESS WE'VE BOTH
BEEN REPLACED.

33:00.140 --> 33:01.175
YOU WEREN'T--
YOU WEREN'T LISTENING.

33:01.210 --> 33:02.768
'CAUSE I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

33:02.810 --> 33:05.779
THE ANSWER'S
ALWAYS IN A BOOK.

33:05.810 --> 33:08.449
HE'S THE ONE
WITH ALL THE ANSWERS

33:08.480 --> 33:10.516
BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE
WITH ALL THE BOOKS.

33:10.550 --> 33:11.482
I NEED A NAME.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.683
HE ALWAYS CALLED ME "DR. PERIK."
I-I NEVER...

33:14.720 --> 33:16.017
BOTHERED TO ASK HIS NAME.

33:16.060 --> 33:17.254
OKAY, PERIK'S HAD ACCESS
TO BOOKS.

33:17.290 --> 33:18.655
WHO RUNS
THE MILLBURN LIBRARY?

33:18.690 --> 33:21.056
IT'S AN INMATE--
ADAM SAWYER.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.352
HE WAS JUST PAROLED
MAYBE TWO WEEKS AGO.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.267
GIVE ME AN ADDRESS,
ANYTHING ELSE YOU GOT.

33:26.300 --> 33:27.289
PECK, GET OUTTA THERE.

33:27.330 --> 33:29.036
(door buzzing)
I'M NOT DONE YET.

33:29.070 --> 33:32.198
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
YOU CAN'T LEAVE NOW.

33:32.240 --> 33:34.538
GAIL! YOU CAN'T LEAVE NOW.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.629
(Perik) GAIL!

33:37.680 --> 33:40.501
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

33:40.550 --> 33:42.108
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

33:42.150 --> 33:43.811
NICK?

33:43.850 --> 33:45.818
LOOK, WE GOT A NAME.

33:45.850 --> 33:47.215
GOOD WORK.

33:47.250 --> 33:48.615
I'LL GET YOU BACK.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.458
(Alert the Medic's
"The Weatherman (Pt. 2)" plays)

33:51.490 --> 33:52.627
(indistinct conversations,
police radio chatter)

33:52.660 --> 33:55.220
* THE WEATHERMAN SAYS

33:55.260 --> 33:58.798

* LOOKS LIKE THE STORM
WILL TAKE AIM TODAY *

34:11.280 --> 34:14.044
* BETTER WE STAND ASIDE

34:15.480 --> 34:18.244
WE FOUND HER TODAY
BECAUSE OF YOU.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.712
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
THE INTERVIEW WILL BE PART

34:19.750 --> 34:21.615
OF THE OFFICIAL RECORD,
SUBMITTED INTO THE COURT

34:21.660 --> 34:23.787
WHEN THE CASE GOES TO TRIAL,
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,

34:23.820 --> 34:25.128
WE'LL TRY
AND KEEP IT PRIVATE.

34:25.160 --> 34:28.493
YOU DID AN AMAZING
AND BRAVE THING TODAY.

34:28.530 --> 34:30.498
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

34:30.530 --> 34:34.489
* UNITED WE STAND,
DIVIDED WE ARE *

34:34.540 --> 34:38.237

WE FOUND GRACE.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.879
(gasps)

34:55.920 --> 34:56.887
AN AMBULANCE
IS TRANSPORTING HER...

34:56.920 --> 34:58.080
AMBULANCE?
TO VICTORIA MERCY.

34:58.130 --> 35:01.429
LOOK, WE'VE ARRANGED A SQUAD
TO TAKE YOU THERE TO MEET HER.

35:01.460 --> 35:03.394
SHE'S SAFE NOW.
WE--WE FOUND HER.

35:03.430 --> 35:05.591
(gasps)

35:05.630 --> 35:08.337
OH, THANK GOD.

35:08.370 --> 35:09.439
THANK YOU.

* WELL, IT'S A LONG WAY

35:10.840 --> 35:12.262
YOU'RE WELCOME.

(telephone rings)

35:22.750 --> 35:26.811
THEY FOUND THE GIRL.

35:26.850 --> 35:28.909
ALIVE. YOU KNOW, SHE'S OKAY.
SHE'S FINE.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.224
I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE YOU KNEW.

35:31.260 --> 35:32.420
YEAH, I HEARD.

35:32.460 --> 35:33.882
BUT THANK YOU
FOR TELLING ME.

35:33.930 --> 35:35.227
YEAH.

35:35.260 --> 35:40.459
AND, UM...
LISTEN, ABOUT EARLIER...

35:40.500 --> 35:42.559
I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

35:42.600 --> 35:45.160
AH, HEY, NO.
FORGET ABOUT IT.

35:45.210 --> 35:48.873
NO. IT'S--IT'S BEEN
A TOUGH DAY.

35:48.910 --> 35:51.504
WHICH IS WHY I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU MIGHT WANNA HAVE A DRINK?

35:51.550 --> 35:55.338
I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST NOT
REALLY MUCH IN THE MOOD

35:55.380 --> 35:56.517
FOR GOING OUT TONIGHT.

35:56.550 --> 35:59.815
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT GOING OUT?

35:59.850 --> 36:01.659
OH.
(clatter)

36:01.690 --> 36:04.523
AND... BLOOP?

36:04.560 --> 36:05.527
OH.
(chuckles)

36:05.560 --> 36:06.959
YEAH?
YEAH.

36:06.990 --> 36:09.720
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.921
(unscrews cap)

36:15.740 --> 36:18.459
(exhales)
WELL, THAT'S EMBARRASSING.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.933
(clatter)

36:20.970 --> 36:22.631
YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:22.680 --> 36:24.545
WHAT?

36:24.580 --> 36:26.901
THERE USED TO BE...

36:26.950 --> 36:31.580
UNLESS SWAREK MOVED IT--
NO, HE DIDN'T.

36:31.620 --> 36:33.281
(exhales) YES.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.589
NICE.

36:39.260 --> 36:42.195
(indistinct conversations)

36:48.670 --> 36:51.332
HEY.

36:51.370 --> 36:54.498
I'M SORRY I WAS HARD ON YOU
THIS AFTERNOON.

36:54.540 --> 36:56.906
I JUST--I-I NEEDED YOU
TO BACK ME UP.

36:56.940 --> 36:59.408
THAT'S WHY
I WANTED TO RIDE TOGETHER.

36:59.450 --> 37:02.339
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.
OKAY.

37:02.380 --> 37:03.449
OKAY.

37:06.450 --> 37:07.519
HOW YOU BEEN, MCNALLY?

37:07.550 --> 37:10.257
GOOD.

37:10.290 --> 37:11.257
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

37:11.290 --> 37:14.453
WHO KNOWS?

37:15.960 --> 37:17.848
STABLE.

37:17.900 --> 37:18.992
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT.

37:19.030 --> 37:21.533
WELL, I'M GLAD.

37:21.570 --> 37:23.435
AS YOUR FRIEND, YOU KNOW.

37:23.470 --> 37:25.904
'CAUSE I REALLY--I REALLY
DO WANNA BE YOUR FRIEND.

37:25.940 --> 37:28.773
I THOUGHT
WE ALREADY WERE FRIENDS.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.341
HEY, MCNALLY.
HEY.

37:32.380 --> 37:34.268
HEY. YOU READY?

37:34.320 --> 37:35.776
YEAH.
JUST NEED A SECOND.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.310
OKEYDOKEY.

37:37.350 --> 37:39.511
BE OUTSIDE. OKAY?

37:39.550 --> 37:40.642
NIGHT, MCNALLY.

37:40.690 --> 37:42.055
NIGHT.

37:42.090 --> 37:45.025
(Jon Bryant's
"David Livingstone" playing)

37:50.430 --> 37:51.829
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

37:53.700 --> 37:55.930
* YOU BE A MYSTERY

37:55.970 --> 37:59.303
* AND I'LL UNCOVER THE TRUTH

37:59.340 --> 38:00.466
(horn honks in distance)

38:00.510 --> 38:01.704
(man speaks indistinctly)

38:01.740 --> 38:02.900
(thunderclap)

38:02.940 --> 38:05.500
* YOU BE THE CHORUS
AND I'LL BE... *

38:05.550 --> 38:09.338
EPSTEIN. JUST THE MAN
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

38:09.380 --> 38:11.917
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE HIT THE PENNY TONIGHT?

38:11.950 --> 38:13.645
DRINKS ARE ON ME,
AND I AM TALKING--

38:13.690 --> 38:16.579
I'M TALKING TWO,
MAYBE EVEN THREE

38:16.620 --> 38:17.985
IF YOU PLAY
YOUR CARDS RIGHT.

38:18.020 --> 38:19.351
YEAH, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

38:19.390 --> 38:22.996
AND I APPRECIATE IT,
BUT... YOU'RE RIGHT.

38:23.030 --> 38:24.054
I SAW THIS COMING.

38:24.100 --> 38:25.761
I KNEW HE WAS GONNA LEAVE.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.337
ALL RIGHT.

38:28.370 --> 38:29.632
I LEFT ZOE LAST NIGHT.

38:29.670 --> 38:31.092
I FILED FOR DIVORCE
THIS MORNING.

38:31.140 --> 38:34.064
IT'S, UH... I'M FINE.

38:34.110 --> 38:35.930
FINE. IT IS WHAT IT IS.
IT WAS IN EVITABLE.

38:35.980 --> 38:36.901
ZOE'S IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.079
THERE'S_NOTHING I CAN DO...
(inhales deeply)

38:39.110 --> 38:41.840
EXCEPT YOU MOVE ON, I GUESS.
THAT'S WHAT THE BOOKS SAY.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.713
WE MOVE ON.
RIP OFF THE BAND-AID, RIGHT?

38:44.750 --> 38:46.843
ARE YOU OKAY?

38:46.890 --> 38:48.482
I KNOW YOU MISS YOUR FRIEND.
I JUST, YOU KNOW,

38:48.520 --> 38:50.488
I THINK I COULD USE ONE
TODAY.

38:50.520 --> 38:52.750
OH, DON'T MAKE THIS ANY WEIRDER
THAN IT IS, ALL RIGHT?

38:52.790 --> 38:54.621
DON'T MAKE ME FEEL WEIRD,
EPSTEIN.

38:54.660 --> 38:56.548
WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE,
YOU KNOW?

38:56.600 --> 38:58.989
TALK ABOUT OUR FEELINGS.
WE'RE GROWN-UPS.

38:59.030 --> 39:00.918
WE GET TRASHED,
TALK ABOUT OUR FEELINGS.

39:00.970 --> 39:03.495
NO, NO, IT'S...
IT'S NOT THAT.

39:03.540 --> 39:05.758
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT WHAT WE WERE GONNA DRINK.

39:05.810 --> 39:07.061
FUZZY NAVEL.

39:07.110 --> 39:08.634
OH, THAT'S LAME.
SEX ON THE BEACH.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.806
FOR YOUR SORORITY SISTERS?

39:09.840 --> 39:13.071
(chuckles)
18-YEAR-OLD SINGLE MALT.

39:13.110 --> 39:15.817
YEAH. GOOD.

39:15.850 --> 39:16.942
I'M GONNA FIND
ANOTHER FRIEND.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.516
(both chuckle)

39:18.550 --> 39:20.381
(sighs)

39:20.420 --> 39:22.479
YOU WILL FINISH THAT
AT THE BAR.

39:22.520 --> 39:25.080
WE'LL DO OUR HOMEWORK
AT THE BAR.

39:25.130 --> 39:28.395
(thunder rumbling)

39:28.430 --> 39:29.852
* YOU BE JOHN LENNON

39:29.900 --> 39:33.427
* AND I'LL BE THE WORLD
THAT HE SEES *

39:33.470 --> 39:37.167
(thunderclap)

39:37.200 --> 39:42.069
* SWEET MIDSUMMER NIGHTS

39:42.110 --> 39:43.077
* WITH YOU

39:43.110 --> 39:45.044
ARE WE GONNA TALK
ABOUT THIS?

39:45.080 --> 39:48.572
(rainfall)

39:48.620 --> 39:50.770
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
THE FIRST TIME I MET YOU.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.688
YOU WERE A LOUSY WAITRESS,

39:55.720 --> 39:57.085
AND YOU STILL HAD THE NERVE
TO YELL AT US

39:57.120 --> 39:58.621
FOR GIVING YOU A BAD TIP.

39:58.660 --> 40:01.424
OKAY.

40:02.660 --> 40:03.991
YOU WERE SO COLD.

40:04.030 --> 40:06.089
IT DROVE ME CRAZY,
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

40:06.130 --> 40:08.598
THAT GIRL'S GONNA
BREAK YOUR HEART.

40:12.740 --> 40:13.934
AND HERE WE ARE.

40:13.970 --> 40:17.133
* I'LL BRING YOU IN
FROM THE COLD *

40:17.180 --> 40:18.807
SO IS THIS HOW
YOU WAN NA DO IT?

40:20.950 --> 40:23.009
* YOU BE THE AMBULANCE

40:23.050 --> 40:24.813
YOU DIDN'T COME HOME.

40:24.850 --> 40:27.080
* BACK DOWN THAT OLD...

40:27.120 --> 40:31.113
AND BLACKSTONE SAID THAT
HE GAVE YOU TIME OFF,

40:31.160 --> 40:33.651
AND...
YOU COULD'VE COME HOME.

40:33.690 --> 40:35.726
INSTEAD YOU WENT ON HOLIDAY
WITH ANDY.

40:35.760 --> 40:39.821
NOTHING HAPPENED WITH US.
IT WAS ONE WEEKEND.

40:39.870 --> 40:41.565
WHAT DID YOU WANT ME TO DO,
COME HOME, UPROOT YOUR LIFE,

40:41.600 --> 40:42.692
AND THEN DISAPPEAR AGAIN?

40:42.740 --> 40:44.093
YES.

40:44.140 --> 40:46.665
SO THAT GIVES YOU LICENSE
TO SLEEP WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.740
GAIL, I DIDN'T COME HOME.

40:51.780 --> 40:53.645
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I DON'T WANNA BE WITH YOU.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.478
(thunderclap)

40:56.520 --> 41:00.240
NO, IT JUST MEANS YOU WANTED
TO BE WITH HER MORE.

41:00.290 --> 41:03.088
YOU WERE JUST
GONNA KEEP LYING TO ME

41:03.120 --> 41:04.826
AND TO YOURSELF.

41:04.860 --> 41:07.658
IT WAS A CRUSH.

41:07.690 --> 41:08.691
I THOUGHT IT'D GO AWAY.

41:08.730 --> 41:10.595
* YOU BE NEW LAND

41:10.630 --> 41:12.598
HOW LONG WERE YOU
GONNA WAIT?

41:12.630 --> 41:14.495
* YOUR ARMS

41:16.870 --> 41:17.939
I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

41:17.970 --> 41:21.133
GOOD NIGHT, GAIL.

41:21.170 --> 41:26.699
* IN THE EARLY WINTER BLUE

41:26.750 --> 41:30.618
* YOU BE MY LADY
AND I'LL BE YOUR MAN *

41:30.650 --> 41:32.140
* THROUGH AND THROUGH

41:35.890 --> 41:37.858
* YOU BE MY LADY

41:37.890 --> 41:42.623
* AND I'LL BE YOUR MAN
THROUGH AND THROUGH *
