meet Hugh Alexander.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.783
I personally selected him
to run this unit.

13:46.910 --> 13:47.951
Didn't you...

13:48.077 --> 13:50.237
Mr Alexander won Britain's
national chess championship.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.956
- Twice.
- You're not the only one

13:53.082 --> 13:55.751
who's good at games round here, Turing.

13:55.919 --> 13:59.296
Are we to work together, then?
I prefer to have my own office.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.982
You're a team and you will work as one.

14:01.007 --> 14:04.176
I don't have time to explain myself
as I go along

14:04.260 --> 14:06.762
and I'm afraid these men
would only slow me down.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.014
If you can't play together,

14:09.098 --> 14:11.225
then I'm afraid
we can't let you play at all.

14:11.309 --> 14:13.227
This is Stewart Menzies. MI6.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.896
There are only five divisions
of Military Intelligence.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.690
- There is no MI6.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.275
That's the spirit.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.279
Mr Turing, do you know
how many British servicemen have died

14:24.364 --> 14:25.614

14:26.032 --> 14:28.033
- Uh, no, I don't.
- Three.

this conversation.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.040
Oh, look, there's another.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.001
I rather hope he didn't have a family.

been going on about,

14:42.131 --> 14:43.507

16:21.356 --> 16:26.401
how many days do you think it would take
to check each of the settings?

16:29.280 --> 16:31.907
It's not days, it's years.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.745
It's 20 million years.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.623
To stop a coming attack,

16:39.749 --> 16:44.086
we would have to check

Er, no, you didn't.

You are?

18:23.895 --> 18:25.353
Yes, we are.

This... This is my brother.

Look, he's my big brother, all right?

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:41.832
And you have a few minutes
to call off his murder.

Oh, please, I...

01:23:00.643 --> 01:23:02.477
The Germans, they won't get suspicious

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:04.062
just because we stop one attack.

01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:06.064
No one will know.

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:09.525
I'm asking you as your friend.

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:12.570
Please.

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:17.700
I'm so sorry.

You're not God, Alan, you don't
get to decide who lives and who dies.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:24.707
Yes, we do.

01:23:28.045 --> 01:23:29.253
Why?

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:31.673
Because no one else can.

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:21.472
Why are you telling me this?

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:27.979
We need your help to keep this a secret
from Admiralty, Army, RAF.

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:34.610
No one can know we broke Enigma.
Not even Denniston.

Who's in the process
of having you fired.

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:39.490
You can take care of that.

01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:42.243
While we develop a system
to help you determine

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:45.329
how much intelligence to act on.

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:47.790
Which, er, attacks to stop,
which to let through.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.334
Statistical analysis.

01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:54.088
The minimal number of actions
it would take for us to win the war

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:59.761
but the maximum number we can take
before the Germans get suspicious.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:03.681
And you're going to
trust all this to statistics?

01:25:05.184 --> 01:25:06.684
- To maths?
- <font color="#80FF00">(ALAN)</font> Correct.

01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:10.354
And then MI6 can come up with
the lies that we tell everybody else.

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:12.607
You'll need a believable
alternative source

01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:15.276
for all the pieces
of information you use.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.445
A false story so that we can explain

01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:20.448
how we got our information
that has nothing to do with Enigma.

01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:23.618
And then you can leak those
stories to the, er, the Germans.

01:25:23.702 --> 01:25:25.286
And then to our own military.

01:25:31.543 --> 01:25:35.630
Maintain a conspiracy of lies
at the highest levels of government?

01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:45.807
Sounds right up my alley.

01:25:49.728 --> 01:25:53.064
Alan, I so rarely
have cause to say this,

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:56.567

01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:05.329
- Not women.
- So what?

01:33:06.498 --> 01:33:07.998
Well, I... I just told you.

01:33:08.124 --> 01:33:09.500
So what?

01:33:12.671 --> 01:33:14.838
I had my suspicions, I always did.

01:33:16.174 --> 01:33:20.010
But we're not like other people.
We love each other in our own way

01:33:20.136 --> 01:33:22.179
and we can have the life together
that we want.

01:33:22.305 --> 01:33:24.640
You... You won't be the perfect husband.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:28.852
Well, I can promise you, I harbour
no intention of being the perfect wife.

01:33:28.937 --> 01:33:33.440
I'll not be fixing your lamb all day
while you come home from the office.

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:35.025
I'll work.

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:37.361
You'll work.

01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:41.031
And we'll have each other's company.

01:33:41.866 --> 01:33:44.159
We'll have each other's minds.

01:33:44.661 --> 01:33:47.329
That sounds like a better
marriage than most.

01:33:49.708 --> 01:33:51.333
Because I care for you.

01:33:52.877 --> 01:33:54.461
And you care for me.

01:33:56.548 --> 01:33:58.215
And we understand
one another more than...

01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:00.718
more than anyone else ever has.

01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:03.971
I don't.

01:34:07.726 --> 01:34:09.351

I'm not going anywhere.

01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:28.662
I've spent entirely too much of my life

01:34:28.747 --> 01:34:30.247
worried about what you think of me

01:34:30.332 --> 01:34:32.249
or what my parents think of me

01:34:32.334 --> 01:34:34.418
or the boys in Hut 8
or the girls in Hut 3.

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:36.086
And do you know what? I'm done.

01:34:37.672 --> 01:34:40.924
This is the most important
work I will ever do

01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:44.386
and no one is going to stop me,
least of all you.

01:34:47.265 --> 01:34:49.683
Do you know what? They were right.

01:34:50.602 --> 01:34:52.770

You really are a monster.

The war dragged on
for two more solitary years

01:35:24.135 --> 01:35:27.846
and every day we performed
our blood-soaked calculus.

01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:33.435
Every day we decided
who lived and who died.

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:38.357
Every day we helped the Allies
to victories and nobody knew.

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:44.029
Stalingrad.

01:35:44.906 --> 01:35:47.825
The Ardenne. The invasion of Normandy.

01:35:48.993 --> 01:35:51.161
All victories that would not
have been possible

01:35:51.246 --> 01:35:53.372
without the intelligence
that we supplied.

01:35:54.749 --> 01:35:57.668
And people talk about the war

01:35:57.752 --> 01:36:01.713
as this epic battle
between civilisations.

01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:06.969
Freedom versus tyranny.
Democracy versus Nazism.

01:36:08.638 --> 01:36:12.766
