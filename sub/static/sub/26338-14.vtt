WEBVTT

00:01.218 --> 00:02.741
NEWSMAN:
We have just received word.

00:02.785 --> 00:06.745
Authorities are confirming
81 dead in the recent explosion

00:06.789 --> 00:08.095
at the Budapest consulate.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.705
Dozens of victims
have been taken

00:09.748 --> 00:11.272
to nearby hospitals
for medical treatment.

00:11.315 --> 00:13.317
Hey, man, I got here as soon
as I could. What's going on?

00:13.361 --> 00:16.059
They got it wrong.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.496
The attack?Yeah.
Th-They're claiming

00:18.540 --> 00:20.107
it was a terrorist attack,
but I'm telling you, man,

00:20.150 --> 00:22.718
they got it wrong.
It's Tiberius Kovac.

00:22.761 --> 00:24.502
Tiberius Kovac.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.026
He was behind the bombings
in Croatia.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.897
I thought he was dead, though.Yeah, so did I.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.900
My Delta unit tracked him down
for 12 years.

00:30.943 --> 00:33.076
He's a bad dude, man,
the worst of the worst.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.599
I thought
I killed him.

00:34.643 --> 00:36.166
But you never found
the body, right?

00:36.210 --> 00:38.342
Yeah, a-and then
check this out.

00:38.386 --> 00:39.778
Then...

00:40.823 --> 00:43.304
...somebody sends me

00:43.347 --> 00:45.001
this photo.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.002
Well, yeah, that's definitely

00:46.046 --> 00:47.830
Tiberius Kovac,
but where'd

00:47.873 --> 00:49.136
you get that from?I don't know.
A-At first,

00:49.179 --> 00:51.138
I-I thought somebody
was messing with me,

00:51.181 --> 00:52.878
sending me a photo
from ten years ago.

00:52.922 --> 00:55.142
And then I find out
somebody in-country

00:55.185 --> 00:58.145
sent this,
confirming Kovac is alive.

00:58.188 --> 01:01.017
This photo's
from a few days ago, man.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.366
This is recent?Yeah.

01:02.410 --> 01:03.585
So he's still alive?

01:06.457 --> 01:08.155
But I-I still don't understand
what this is about.

01:08.198 --> 01:09.330
Okay, okay.

01:09.373 --> 01:11.462
The U.S. government has
actionable intel

01:11.506 --> 01:13.682
that Kovac has been planning
terrorist attacks

01:13.725 --> 01:15.336
against Europe
and the United States.

01:15.379 --> 01:16.859
They're putting together
a task force

01:16.902 --> 01:20.515
to hunt him down. It's the
biggest operation since 9/11.

01:20.558 --> 01:22.169
And they want you
to be a part of it.

01:22.212 --> 01:23.866
They want me to lead the hunt.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.911
I report for duty in 48 hours.

01:26.912 --> 01:28.871
All right.
Get me on the task force.

01:28.914 --> 01:30.568
No.
Come on,
get the Phoenix on this.

01:30.612 --> 01:32.353
No, no, hoss,
I'm sorry.

01:32.396 --> 01:33.702
I-I can't do that.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.051
It's above my head.
This is a lean operation.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.706
Every country is hand-picking
their own operatives

01:37.749 --> 01:39.882
who's already been
on the hunt for Kovac.

01:39.925 --> 01:41.884
They want, they want people
that have

01:41.927 --> 01:43.886
already dealt with this guy,
you know what I mean?

01:43.929 --> 01:45.061
And hear me out
on this,

01:45.105 --> 01:46.193
I really need you here.

01:46.236 --> 01:49.021
The Phoenix
needs you.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.764
Yeah, no, I, I hear you.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.899
It's just kind of hard
to imagine you not being around.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.032
What did the others say?

02:00.076 --> 02:02.209
I haven't really told them yet.

02:02.252 --> 02:04.211
I-I wanted to tell you first.

02:04.254 --> 02:06.300
Oh, you invited me here...

02:06.343 --> 02:11.087
To say goodbye to a good friend.

03:05.097 --> 03:07.317
Matilda Webber.

03:07.361 --> 03:11.800
I hope that your trip
was comfortable.

03:11.843 --> 03:15.412
Four hours in an SUV with bad
shocks and no air-conditioning.

03:15.456 --> 03:16.631
What do you think?

03:16.674 --> 03:17.893
And you may want

03:17.936 --> 03:20.243
to spring for some deodorant
for your boys.

03:20.287 --> 03:23.464
The one to my left was
a little ripe.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.510
Apologies.Save it.

03:26.554 --> 03:27.729
Why am I here?

03:27.772 --> 03:29.818
I need a favor.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.907
And why would I do you a favor?

03:31.950 --> 03:33.952
Get out.

03:35.127 --> 03:37.173
Because of what
you'll get in return.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.522
I'm listening.

03:38.566 --> 03:41.308
I want you to provide me
safe passage into the U.S.

03:41.351 --> 03:43.353
so that I may attend
my daughter's wedding.

03:43.397 --> 03:44.702
Alonzo,

03:44.746 --> 03:47.357
you're the head
of a massive criminal operation.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.446
You've been on Interpol's
most wanted list

03:49.490 --> 03:52.362
for the last seven years,
the FBI's for five.

03:52.406 --> 03:55.365
What could you possibly give up
that would be worth the risk

03:55.409 --> 03:57.541
of letting you back
into the States?

03:58.586 --> 04:00.370
Me.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.244
I see that you're skeptical.
I get it.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.376
I would be, too,
if I was in your shoes.

04:06.420 --> 04:09.553
But I'm serious.
I'm tired of running.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.381
In the last
six months alone,

04:11.425 --> 04:14.341
I've narrowly escaped
an assassin's bullet twice.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.038
It's time.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.216
Just you is not enough.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.653
For me to agree
to do this,

04:22.697 --> 04:25.047
I would need intel
on the Puebla cartel,

04:25.090 --> 04:27.223
Al Barakat,
and the NPO.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.485
You would need to give up

04:28.529 --> 04:31.009
all your clients
and your whole organization,

04:31.053 --> 04:32.533
and I'll make
this happen.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.056
But short of that?

04:34.099 --> 04:35.579
The answer's no.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.499
That won't be a problem.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.675
Do we have a deal?

04:46.460 --> 04:48.070
Why me?

04:48.113 --> 04:49.724
That's easy.

04:49.767 --> 04:52.814
Out of all the federal agents
that I've crossed paths with,

04:52.857 --> 04:55.164
I know that you're the only one
that would keep her word.

04:55.207 --> 04:58.167
And while that's true,
I do need to remind you

04:58.210 --> 05:00.474
that I work on behalf
of Uncle Sam.

05:00.517 --> 05:03.172
He doesn't negotiate
with terrorists.

05:03.215 --> 05:05.348
But would he negotiate
with a father

05:05.392 --> 05:08.264
that just wants to walk his
only daughter down the aisle?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.485
So...

05:11.528 --> 05:13.313
do we have a deal?

05:25.673 --> 05:27.022
Hey. What happened to you guys?

05:27.065 --> 05:28.632
Not like you to bail
on game night last minute.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.112
BOZER:
You know,

05:30.155 --> 05:31.940
Clue with only two people
isn't really a challenge.

05:31.983 --> 05:33.768
JACK:
Yeah, sorry about
that. The, uh,

05:33.811 --> 05:35.552
popcorn button
on my microwave was broken,

05:35.596 --> 05:37.728
so I had to have Mac come
over and take a look at it.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.122
Okay. That's...

05:41.253 --> 05:42.733
...that's plausible, right?

05:42.777 --> 05:44.256
Guys, you know the rules.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.737
No talking about game night
at work.

05:46.781 --> 05:48.348
Jack,

05:48.391 --> 05:50.567
do you recognize this guy?Yeah.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.221
That handsome devil
is Alonzo Olvera.

05:52.264 --> 05:53.614
That is correct.

05:53.657 --> 05:56.051
For those of you who are
not familiar with Alonzo,

05:56.094 --> 05:58.532
he is the head
of the Olvera crime family.

05:58.575 --> 06:02.231
Took over the business after his
father passed away 17 years ago

06:02.274 --> 06:04.451
and is responsible
for transforming it

06:04.494 --> 06:05.713
from a midsized
criminal operation

06:05.756 --> 06:09.064
to a worldwide empire.

06:09.107 --> 06:10.848
So he's like an evil Starbucks.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.241
MATTY:
If Starbucks

06:12.284 --> 06:16.332
sold illegal arms instead
of macchiatos, then, yes.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.638
Phoenix has
just been given

06:17.681 --> 06:20.075
a rare opportunity
to put Alonzo behind bars.

06:20.118 --> 06:24.645
Meet Camila Olvera,
Alonzo's only child.

06:24.688 --> 06:27.125
12 years ago,
Alonzo escaped the U.S.

06:27.169 --> 06:29.476
to avoid arrest
and he left Camila behind.

06:29.519 --> 06:30.781
RILEY:
So this guy abandoned

06:30.825 --> 06:33.044
his little girl
just to avoid lockup?

06:33.088 --> 06:34.916
That's harsh.

06:34.959 --> 06:38.441
Perhaps, but leaving Camila
behind did allow her

06:38.485 --> 06:40.835
the opportunity to grow up
outside of the sphere

06:40.878 --> 06:42.358
of Alonzo's influence.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.794
As far as
our intel indicates,

06:43.838 --> 06:46.667
she's had zero involvement
with the family business.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.669
Pretty sure he did that
on purpose.

06:48.712 --> 06:50.714
Ah, world's greatest dad.

06:50.758 --> 06:52.281
Actually, she might think so.

06:52.324 --> 06:53.674
The two have
a very close relationship,

06:53.717 --> 06:56.590
which brings me
to why we're here.

06:56.633 --> 06:59.288
Little Camila
is all grown up,

06:59.331 --> 07:01.464
has fallen in love,
and is getting married

07:01.508 --> 07:02.987
tomorrow night in Pebble Beach.

07:03.031 --> 07:04.467
I'm still not connecting
the dots.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.774
How does Camila getting married
help us put Alonzo away?

07:06.817 --> 07:09.777
Because Daddy Dearest wants to
attend his daughter's wedding.

07:09.820 --> 07:12.301
Ah.So much so that he's willing
to turn himself in,

07:12.344 --> 07:15.347
testify against
his entire organization,

07:15.391 --> 07:16.610
and hand over enough evidence

07:16.653 --> 07:18.960
to tear the whole thing down.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.527
JACK:
And what has you convinced

07:20.570 --> 07:23.486
that this conniving lowlife
is just gonna allow himself

07:23.530 --> 07:25.793
to be taken into custody
after 12 years?

07:25.836 --> 07:27.969
No, I think old Lonny-boy's
trying to pull a fast one

07:28.012 --> 07:30.972
to get back in the country
and then bail. I say no deal.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.148
BOZER:
Jack has a point. I mean,
the last thing we want

07:33.191 --> 07:35.455
to be responsible for is
letting a guy like that
loose in the U.S.

07:36.760 --> 07:40.329
Okay. Your opinions
are all noted.

07:40.372 --> 07:41.504
Noted?

07:41.548 --> 07:42.810
Does that mean you've already

07:42.853 --> 07:44.159
accepted this guy's proposal?

07:44.202 --> 07:45.247
Yes, it does.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.728
Hey, look,
your concerns are all valid.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.294
Agreeing
to Alonzo's conditions

07:49.338 --> 07:51.514
does carry a certain risk.

07:51.558 --> 07:54.604
And what if he decides not to
hold up his end of the bargain?

07:54.648 --> 07:57.389
Then this all falls on me.Okay.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.435
But pulling Alonzo's whole
organization out by the roots

07:59.479 --> 08:00.697
is one hell of a reward.

08:00.741 --> 08:03.526
Which is why I'm willing
to roll the dice here.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.485
Then, we are with you, Matty.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.530
What's the plan?Thank you, Mac.

08:07.574 --> 08:10.228
Alonzo has agreed
to turn himself

08:10.272 --> 08:12.404
and the hard evidence
into our custody

08:12.448 --> 08:15.016
the day after the wedding,
which, as far as I'm concerned,

08:15.059 --> 08:16.974
means he's ours at 12:01 a.m.

08:17.018 --> 08:19.150
I'm not taking any chances
with this guy.

08:19.194 --> 08:21.501
We need to make sure he holds up
his end of the bargain.

08:21.544 --> 08:24.547
Sounds like
we're crashing a wedding.

09:01.932 --> 09:03.934
GUESTS:
Aw...

09:07.764 --> 09:08.896
RILEY:
So...

09:08.939 --> 09:10.027
what's going on, Jack?

09:11.551 --> 09:12.682
What do you mean?

09:12.726 --> 09:15.032
Well, you never miss game night.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.860
Mac can't stop looking at you.

09:16.904 --> 09:19.384
And you haven't made a joke
about ice swans yet.

09:19.428 --> 09:20.864
So what's the problem?

09:24.607 --> 09:26.914
JACK:
Are you kidding me right now?

09:26.957 --> 09:28.089
Boze, are you crying?

09:28.132 --> 09:30.091
Shut up, Jack.
True love is beautiful.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.049
Oh, is that
what you think this is?

09:32.093 --> 09:34.138
I think what Jack means is:
you're an agent

09:34.182 --> 09:35.313
on an official op, Bozer.

09:35.357 --> 09:37.707
Pull yourself together.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.754
Squeeze it.

09:40.797 --> 09:41.668
What?

09:41.711 --> 09:42.930
Man, I'm not holding your hand.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.148
The pressure
should be enough

09:44.192 --> 09:45.933
to distract you
from the chemical reaction

09:45.976 --> 09:47.761
that's going on
in your hippocampus

09:47.804 --> 09:50.372
that's making you feel
like crying. Science.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.945
PRIEST:

10:48.996 --> 10:50.824
Maybe.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.653

several hours to think about

10:53.696 --> 10:55.002
a lifetime behind bars.

MATTY:
Once the ceremony ends

10:56.394 --> 10:58.222
and the reception starts,

10:58.266 --> 10:59.702
people are gonna
start moving around

10:59.746 --> 11:01.530
and things are gonna
get chaotic.

11:01.573 --> 11:04.838
If Alonzo's gonna run,
it'll be then.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.069
Excuse me.

11:19.113 --> 11:20.767
Okay, everyone, check in.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.205
North exit's covered.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.947
All clear by the food buffet.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.600
I mean, I mean, the south exit.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.602
BOZER :
Come on, Jack,
it's right in my ear.

11:30.646 --> 11:31.865
Could you finish chewing first?

11:35.999 --> 11:37.044
BOZER:
All right.

11:37.087 --> 11:39.133
All clear by the east exit.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.701
Hey, here's an idea-- how about
I take one for the team

11:41.744 --> 11:44.312
and I just guard this door
the rest of the night?

11:44.355 --> 11:46.662
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey, gorgeous.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.577
Uh-uh.

11:48.620 --> 11:51.449
Don't tell me a pretty girl
like you doesn't have a date.

11:51.493 --> 11:54.539
Actually, I do.
His name's popcorn shrimp

11:54.583 --> 11:56.237
and he gets really jealous.

11:56.280 --> 12:00.197
Scram.

12:00.241 --> 12:01.808
West exit's

12:01.851 --> 12:03.331
full of cheesy
sleazeballs.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.161
But no activity.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.391
Target's headed
towards the balcony.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.787
I got him.

12:32.360 --> 12:35.798
Don't get any ideas.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.845
I don't remember
sending you an invitation.

12:38.888 --> 12:40.020
You didn't.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.109
Well, that answers my question.

12:42.152 --> 12:44.415
Is there no trust between us?

12:44.459 --> 12:46.461
I trust that my people
will be watching

12:46.504 --> 12:48.811
your every move until
exactly 12:01 a.m.,

12:48.855 --> 12:53.381
at which point today becomes
tomorrow and you become mine.

12:53.424 --> 12:56.819
I give you my word,
I'm turning myself in.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.517
But now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to spend as much time

12:59.561 --> 13:02.259
as I can with my family before
I become a permanent guest

13:02.303 --> 13:03.739
of the federal government.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.196
Oh. Yeah.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.851
Well, when are you
gonna tell everyone else?

13:28.895 --> 13:29.852
About what?

13:29.896 --> 13:30.984
Are you serious?

13:31.027 --> 13:33.508
Oh. After this mission...

13:33.551 --> 13:35.031
Uh, you can swallow first.

13:36.424 --> 13:37.904
After this mission, I guess.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.993
I figured one last hoorah
before I ship out, you know?

13:40.036 --> 13:44.388
Man, kind of hard to imagine
the Phoenix without you.

13:44.432 --> 13:47.174
Nah, I'll be back before
you even miss me, and, hey,

13:47.217 --> 13:50.351
Matty let me handpick my
replacement to watch your back.

13:50.394 --> 13:52.353
I think you're really
gonna like her.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.616
Or kill her,
one of the two.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.618
That's oddly specific.
Should I be worried?

13:56.661 --> 13:58.881
No, man. You'll meet
her soon enough.

13:58.925 --> 14:01.231
And trust me,
there's nobody

14:01.275 --> 14:03.407
I'd trust more to watch
your back than this woman.

14:03.451 --> 14:04.582
She is really good.

14:04.626 --> 14:07.150
Well, other than me,
obviously.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.499
All right,
but what about...

14:08.543 --> 14:10.719
Do me a favor? Will you
take this tray of little--

14:10.762 --> 14:13.113
I don't know--
weenie thingies to, uh, Riley?

14:13.156 --> 14:15.463
She's really been wanting
to try one.

14:15.506 --> 14:18.683
And word to the wise,
the grapes got seeds in 'em.

14:18.727 --> 14:19.684
Noted.

14:19.728 --> 14:22.339
Now, watch yourself.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.604
Finally.

14:26.648 --> 14:30.739
I thought Jack was gonna
polish off the whole buffet.

14:30.782 --> 14:33.046
So what were you boys
talking about?

14:33.089 --> 14:37.224
Uh... you know... guy stuff.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.922
Okay, so you were
trying to explain

14:39.966 --> 14:42.359
something science-y
and Jack's head

14:42.403 --> 14:43.926
was about to explode,
as usual, right?

14:43.970 --> 14:45.145
Yup. Something like that.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.189
Mm-hmm.

14:46.233 --> 14:49.845
You know,
you're a terrible liar.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.501
One of my best
qualities. How we looking?

14:53.544 --> 14:55.242
There's no activity.

14:55.285 --> 14:57.374
Seems quiet.

14:57.418 --> 15:00.029
You think he's really
here for her,

15:00.073 --> 15:02.640
or are we gonna have trouble?

15:02.684 --> 15:05.905
Honestly?
I don't know.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.431
Something's up.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.259
I just lost the hallway
in the north exit.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.217
Can you get it back?Yeah, I'm working on it.

15:16.741 --> 15:18.918
Someone's locking me out
of all the cameras.

15:23.313 --> 15:26.229
Matty, we got a situation.
Who's got eyes on Alonzo?

15:33.976 --> 15:36.283
I got him. He's headed
toward the west exit.

15:36.326 --> 15:37.458
I repeat: Alonzo's on the move.

15:37.501 --> 15:40.243
MATTY:
Do not lose sight of him.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.642
Yeah, we got him.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.513
He just took a right
halfway down the hallway.

15:49.557 --> 15:50.906
Any idea where
he's going, Riley?

15:50.950 --> 15:51.951
Looks like that goes
to the indoor pool.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.691
There's windows in there, Mac.

15:57.391 --> 16:00.046
I need backup at the pool ASAP.On the way.

16:08.315 --> 16:09.577
You started the party
without me?

16:09.620 --> 16:12.493
I didn't really have
a choice. Let him go now.

16:29.075 --> 16:32.382
Jack, did you see my tackle?
I put my shoulder into him

16:32.426 --> 16:33.514
just like you taught... Mm...

16:33.557 --> 16:34.819
Mm...

16:34.863 --> 16:37.300
Shh...

16:47.093 --> 16:48.616
JACK:
Bad news, Matty.

16:48.659 --> 16:52.794
One of these guys phoned a
friend before Bozer put him down

16:52.837 --> 16:54.883
for a nap.

16:54.926 --> 16:57.364
Okay, get this.
No knives. No guns.

16:57.407 --> 16:59.844
Just zip ties and this
bottle of chloroform.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.933
We found the same thing
on that guy.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.935
All right, These guys
aren't here to kill you.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.199
They're here to kidnap you.All right, that's it.
I'm shutting this down.

17:06.242 --> 17:07.852
Time to get Alonzo out of here.

17:07.896 --> 17:11.247
All right, I'll get transpo.
Meet you guys outside.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.775
MAN:
Secure the perimeter.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.255
Watch your six.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.517
Lock it up.North unit clear.

17:20.561 --> 17:21.823
South unit clear.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.130
Move out. Go, go, go.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.524
We're clear.

17:27.568 --> 17:30.179
Scratch that. I don't think
we're going anywhere.

17:43.932 --> 17:47.457
Listen up. Party's over.
Everyone along the wall!

17:47.501 --> 17:50.678
Hands where I can see them.
You hard of hearing?

17:50.721 --> 17:54.073
I see you. Get up.
Move, move. Back.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.074
Back against the wall.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.727
Back!

18:02.603 --> 18:04.300
Hey.

18:05.345 --> 18:08.217
Nice tie.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.785
Everyone, shut up.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.747
If your name isn't
Alonzo Olvera,

18:16.791 --> 18:19.098
you can relax,
we're not here for you.

18:19.141 --> 18:23.363
Keep calm and you
may keep your life.

18:23.406 --> 18:27.193
Now, if your name
is Alonzo Olvera,

18:27.236 --> 18:31.414
I suggest you step forward,
make this easy.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.721
Party crashers just took the
ballroom searching for Alonzo.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.331
Tell me you have him.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.116
Yep, he's with us.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.552
Do you recognize
these men?

18:38.595 --> 18:40.902
No.
Hey. Hey!

18:40.945 --> 18:42.730
This is no time to be
withholding information

18:42.773 --> 18:44.166
there, Alonzo.I'm not.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.125
My only child and everyone
I love is in that ballroom.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.301
If I knew anything about
these men, I would tell you.

18:48.344 --> 18:49.650
BOZER:
Well, clearly
they know you

18:49.693 --> 18:52.305
and that you'd
be here tonight.

18:52.348 --> 18:53.871
I got an ID on our pool posse.

18:53.915 --> 18:56.396
They come from a domestic
terrorist group called Chronos.

18:56.439 --> 18:58.615
That name ringing
any bells there, Lonny?

18:58.659 --> 19:01.227
Chronos? Small-time.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.316
Well, they just upped
their game, big-time.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.926
Any idea why
they'd be after you?

19:04.969 --> 19:06.710
We had a deal in the
works a few months ago.

19:06.754 --> 19:08.408
They purchased hardware, a lot.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.061
But the shipment
was seized by customs.

19:10.105 --> 19:12.586
They blamed me and they
wanted their money back.

19:12.629 --> 19:13.761
And I take it
you didn't get around

19:13.804 --> 19:14.979
to giving them their refund.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.416
Of course not.
That's not how I operate.

19:16.459 --> 19:17.852
The buyer assumes
all risk.

19:17.895 --> 19:19.506
I'm always
clear on that.

19:19.549 --> 19:22.204
Well, obviously, they
didn't like the fine print.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.597
MacGYVER:
Matty, what's going on?

19:23.640 --> 19:25.076
Everything okay?

19:25.120 --> 19:27.557
These guys just realized
Alonzo's not in the ballroom.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.216
Camila Olvera, congrats
on your big day.

19:34.260 --> 19:37.045
You look lovely.
Where's Dad?
I don't...

19:37.088 --> 19:39.526
Look, this is her wedding day.I don't know!

19:43.660 --> 19:46.097
You remember when I said
I wouldn't hurt anyone?

19:46.141 --> 19:48.883
Well, I lied.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.363
So, tell me where
your father is

19:50.406 --> 19:52.974
before I start
reallyhurting people.

19:53.017 --> 19:56.456
No. No, no, I-I told you,
I don't know!

19:56.499 --> 19:58.153
: I don't know,
please, I don't know.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.199
Then I'll start
with your family.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.678
Where's Grandma?
Let's get her up here.

20:01.722 --> 20:02.853
CAMILA:
No. I told you.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.638
I don't know. Please. ¿Abuelita?

20:04.681 --> 20:05.682
I don't know.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.690
Please.

20:16.476 --> 20:21.002
Two-man teams. Floor by floor.
I want him found now!

20:21.045 --> 20:22.830
Move!

20:26.050 --> 20:27.400
Help him. Help him.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.800
MATTY:
Mac, ten hostiles
just locked the guests

20:36.844 --> 20:38.324
in the ballroom
to search for Alonzo.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.587
You got to get him and
the evidence he's turning over

20:40.630 --> 20:41.979
out of this building right now.

20:42.023 --> 20:43.285
All right, time to go.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.026
Wait, wait, wait.
M-My daughter, my family.

20:45.069 --> 20:47.333
Will be much safer when
we get you out of here.

20:47.376 --> 20:48.769
Now, where was the evidence
you were gonna turn over?

20:48.812 --> 20:51.946
On a tablet, locked in a safe.
Suite 811.

20:51.989 --> 20:53.861
Okay, Riley and I
will go get the tablet.

20:53.904 --> 20:54.862
You two, take him.Wait, wait.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.342
You'll need me to open the safe.

20:56.385 --> 20:57.995
Why?

20:58.039 --> 21:01.651
The safe is biometric. You need
a retinal scan to open it.

21:01.695 --> 21:04.045
What kind of hotel safe
requires a retinal scan?

21:04.088 --> 21:05.176
The safe is mine.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.874
I brought it
as an insurance policy.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.789
I had to make sure that you
honor your end of the deal

21:08.832 --> 21:10.225
before I turn the tablet over.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.314
Okay. There's got to be
another way into that safe.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.185
Here's an idea.
We take the safe,

21:14.229 --> 21:16.623
we throw it off the balcony,
and then we pick it up

21:16.666 --> 21:17.885
once Alonzo's
out of the building.

21:17.928 --> 21:19.713
That will destroy
the evidence.

21:19.756 --> 21:21.410
My safe is packed with thermite.

21:21.454 --> 21:23.282
It's rigged to shock
and tilt sensors.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.153
Anyone but me tries
to open it or move it,

21:25.196 --> 21:27.503
that tablet will turn into
a puddle of metal and plastic.

21:27.547 --> 21:28.548
Thermite.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.768
I'm out of ideas, Mac.

21:31.812 --> 21:33.379
Okay, Riley and I will go
with Alonzo,

21:33.422 --> 21:34.641
I'll figure something out.

21:34.684 --> 21:35.685
You two, we have ten hostiles
in the area.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.470
Think you can reduce
that number?

21:37.513 --> 21:39.385
Yeah, we can handle that.
Let's go.All right.

21:39.428 --> 21:41.604
811, let's go.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.650
Nothing here.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.568
All right.

21:48.611 --> 21:50.091
We got two bogeys in the hall.

21:50.134 --> 21:51.875
We got a couple of bogeys,
let's turn 'em into birdies.

21:51.919 --> 21:54.574
Where'd you go?Found the pro shop,
got us a couple weapons.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.663
Figuring we need
to keep this nice and quiet.

21:56.706 --> 21:58.926
A putter, Jack, seriously?

21:58.969 --> 22:01.015
It's titanium and graphite--

22:01.058 --> 22:02.408
light in the hands,
bad news for the face.

22:02.451 --> 22:04.845
Remember to keep
your left arm straight.

22:15.899 --> 22:17.074
I can't seem to...

22:17.118 --> 22:19.033
find my key.

22:19.076 --> 22:20.469
Course not.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.210
Um, any chance
we can break it down?Well, no.

22:22.253 --> 22:24.473
'Cause we'll make too much noise
and then draw them to our...

22:26.083 --> 22:27.215
position.

22:42.622 --> 22:43.623
What is he doing?

22:43.666 --> 22:44.885
It's better
not to ask.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.469
How is that gonna
open the door?

23:03.512 --> 23:05.993
Well, how familiar are you
with lever arm distance,

23:06.036 --> 23:08.474
tangential force, and torque?

23:08.517 --> 23:09.823
ALONZO:
I'm not sure what
any of that means.

23:09.866 --> 23:10.824
RILEY:
Uh, it-it means...

23:10.867 --> 23:12.478
physics is awesome.

23:16.917 --> 23:18.440
Well said.Hey!

23:19.528 --> 23:22.052
All right. Alonzo, go
ahead and get the tablet.

23:22.096 --> 23:23.489
Riley, help me
with the furniture.

23:23.532 --> 23:25.491
We found Alonzo, suite 811.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.188
Repeat: 811.

23:27.231 --> 23:28.668
We're on our way.
Let's go.

23:30.974 --> 23:32.715
Hole in one.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.325
Okay.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.719
Six down, four to go.

23:36.763 --> 23:39.548
Pretty sure we'll find the rest
on the eighth floor.Hey, hey.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.158
What do you say
we switch to guns?

23:41.202 --> 23:42.508
Hey, I like that.
Yeah.

23:42.551 --> 23:43.596
Let's go.

23:59.307 --> 24:00.917
RILEY:
All right,
we need an exit.

24:00.961 --> 24:02.223
What about these windows?

24:02.266 --> 24:03.529
We're eight floors up.

24:03.572 --> 24:05.008
So, if the windows
and the doors are out,

24:05.052 --> 24:07.271
how are we getting out?

24:26.160 --> 24:27.770
I got a crazy idea.

24:27.814 --> 24:28.902
Riley, I need toothpaste.

24:28.945 --> 24:31.121
Alonzo, grab me that
remote over there.

24:31.165 --> 24:32.732
And, uh, see if there's any
chewing gum in the minibar.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.266
Whoa, whatever your plan is,

24:45.309 --> 24:46.746
I hope it's worth
seven years' bad luck.

24:46.789 --> 24:49.444
I'm only worried about
the next seven minutes.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.228
My dad used to say,

24:51.272 --> 24:53.317
"If one door closes,
make another door."

24:54.188 --> 24:55.711
When lit, thermite undergoes

24:55.755 --> 24:57.974
an exothermic reduction
oxidation reaction.

24:58.018 --> 24:59.585
Simply put:

24:59.628 --> 25:00.760
It gets really hot.

25:00.803 --> 25:02.283
But you need a way

25:02.326 --> 25:03.806
to direct the heat.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.939
Using this mirror,
the toothpaste as an adhesive,

25:05.982 --> 25:07.767
and the thermite powder
from the safe,

25:07.810 --> 25:09.812
I can create a makeshift
breaching frame.

25:09.856 --> 25:12.423
Wrap some tinfoil around
both ends of a battery,

25:12.467 --> 25:14.338
use it to light the thermite,

25:14.382 --> 25:15.905
and... boom.

25:15.949 --> 25:16.906
You've opened another door.

25:16.950 --> 25:18.081
Come on, come
on, come on.

25:22.956 --> 25:24.218
MAN:
Almost in.

25:29.310 --> 25:30.529
All right, let's go.

25:57.381 --> 25:58.513
He's in here somewhere.

26:05.912 --> 26:07.435
Hey, hey.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.224
On my mark, throw that.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.478
Now.

26:50.521 --> 26:52.045
Dude!

27:05.362 --> 27:08.496
You never cease to amaze me.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.411
Where's Alonzo?

27:10.454 --> 27:11.847
RILEY:
He bolted.

27:11.891 --> 27:14.458
And he took the tablet
with him. Come on, let's go.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.379
Hold on, you're telling me
that you neutralized

27:22.423 --> 27:25.513
the Chronos threat but then
you lost Alonzo and the tablet?

27:25.556 --> 27:26.862
"Lost" may be
a little harsh,

27:26.906 --> 27:28.211
more like temporarily
misplaced.

27:28.255 --> 27:29.778
He couldn't
have gotten far.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.737
You search this floor,
I'm gonna head downstairs.Okay.

27:33.390 --> 27:35.218
You know, Chronos actually did
us a favor

27:35.262 --> 27:36.698
by locking all the exits.
If there's a silver lining here,

27:36.742 --> 27:39.048
it's that we know
Alonzo's still in the building.

27:39.092 --> 27:40.833
That doesn't make me feel
much better.

27:40.876 --> 27:43.705
I went way out on a limb
to make this deal with Alonzo.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.751
If he burns me...JACK:
He won't, Matty.

27:45.794 --> 27:47.709
We're gonna find him.
Mac, we're headed to you now.

27:49.755 --> 27:50.930
Guys.

27:50.973 --> 27:52.583
Found Alonzo.

27:52.627 --> 27:54.498
Excellent. Keep him where he is.

27:58.589 --> 28:00.809
Well, that shouldn't be
a problem; he's dead.

28:00.853 --> 28:02.593
Dead?

28:02.637 --> 28:04.334
What do you mean, dead?

28:04.378 --> 28:05.684
I mean his heart's not beating

28:05.727 --> 28:07.903
and his lungs
aren't drawing breath.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.992
It gets worse.

28:10.036 --> 28:11.602
Whoever killed him...

28:11.646 --> 28:12.603
also stole the tablet.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.257
Hang on, hang on
a second now.

28:14.301 --> 28:15.955
I know I'm no math genius,

28:15.998 --> 28:18.479
but last time I checked,
six plus four is still ten.

28:18.522 --> 28:20.133
Bozer and I took out
six goons,

28:20.176 --> 28:21.438
Mac and Riley
took out four.

28:21.482 --> 28:22.788
That's ten scumbags
on ice.

28:22.831 --> 28:25.747
So, if we took them all out,
who got to Alonzo?

28:25.791 --> 28:28.663
Well, he wasn't stabbed or shot.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.360
Looks like he just
fell over dead.

28:32.362 --> 28:33.581
Wait.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.238
What's this right here
on his neck?

28:38.281 --> 28:40.196
Guys, I don't think
this is Chronos.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.632
Not unless they suddenly
changed their plan

28:41.676 --> 28:44.070
from kidnapping Alonzo
to poisoning him.

28:44.113 --> 28:46.289
Wait, what are you saying?
Someone else killed him?

28:46.333 --> 28:48.596
Someone unaffiliated
with the terrorists we took out?

28:48.639 --> 28:49.553
That's what it looks like.

28:49.597 --> 28:50.424
MATTY:
Okay, guys, listen up.

28:50.467 --> 28:51.425
Our witness is dead

28:51.468 --> 28:52.426
and his evidence is missing.

28:52.469 --> 28:53.644
If we want any hope

28:53.688 --> 28:54.645
of salvaging this op,

28:54.689 --> 28:56.125
we need to find Alonzo's killer

28:56.169 --> 28:57.779
and get that tablet back.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.259
How are we supposed to find
this mystery murderer?

28:59.302 --> 29:00.608
MacGYVER:
All right.
First thing we need to do

29:00.651 --> 29:02.218
is identify the poison.

29:02.262 --> 29:03.959
Riley, can you get me
some laundry detergent?

29:04.003 --> 29:05.004
Yeah, yeah.

29:29.028 --> 29:30.725
RILEY:
Hey.

29:30.769 --> 29:31.813
Does this work?

29:31.857 --> 29:33.772
Yeah. That is perfect.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.687
It's difficult to identify

29:36.731 --> 29:38.864
a poison without an actual lab,

29:38.907 --> 29:40.256
but I might be able
to narrow down

29:40.300 --> 29:42.693
our options with a few
household ingredients.

29:42.737 --> 29:45.131
I just need to mix a few drops of Alonzo's blood with vinegar,

29:45.174 --> 29:47.133
baking soda,
and a fluorescent agent,

29:47.176 --> 29:51.528
shine a UV light on it,
and hope for a little luck.

29:51.572 --> 29:53.356
RILEY:
Okay. That's a little weird

29:53.400 --> 29:54.705
and unsanitary.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.185
What does this mean?

29:56.229 --> 29:59.536
MacGYVER:
Blue-green fluorescence
under a UV light

29:59.580 --> 30:00.842
means he was killed
with cyanide.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.539
And how does knowing this
help us?

30:02.583 --> 30:04.846
Given his weight and how quickly
his symptoms progressed,

30:04.890 --> 30:08.763
I'd say he was dosed
80 minutes ago, give or take.

30:09.895 --> 30:11.810
Hold on.
That would mean that Alonzo

30:11.853 --> 30:15.030
was injected at the reception
while we still had eyes on him.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.858
Before Chronos arrived.

30:16.902 --> 30:19.730
But the only people here during
that time were guests and staff.

30:19.774 --> 30:21.558
Was Alonzo killed by someone
at the wedding?

30:21.602 --> 30:23.865
Well, whoever did it, they're
still in the building right now.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.519
We just need to
keep them here.

30:25.562 --> 30:27.216
Well, that could be a problem.
The guests have already started

30:27.260 --> 30:30.045
to notice that our bad guys
haven't checked in for a while.

30:30.089 --> 30:31.264
They're getting restless.

30:35.790 --> 30:37.009
There's no one out there.

30:37.052 --> 30:38.445
They chained us in and left.

30:38.488 --> 30:40.795
Clear this table off.
We're busting out of here.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.928
MATTY:
The bride and groom
are mobilizing an escape.

30:42.971 --> 30:43.929
We don't have a lot of time.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.151
MacGYVER:
We need to keep
the guests in the ballroom.

30:49.195 --> 30:50.892
If they get out, it's gonna
make it a lot harder

30:50.936 --> 30:52.720
to catch our killer.MATTY: Might even provide
a cover for them

30:52.763 --> 30:55.679
to leave the building unnoticed,
take the tablet with them.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.203
Yeah, we can't let that happen.

30:57.246 --> 30:58.378
I know how to make
the party stay put.

30:58.421 --> 30:59.553
Dare I even ask, Jack?

30:59.596 --> 31:00.902
Yeah, it's better if you don't.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.469
Don't worry. Bozer and I
will handle the guests.

31:02.512 --> 31:03.774
Yeah.Fine. Go do it.

31:03.818 --> 31:06.212
Mac, Riley, go get me back
that damn tablet.

31:06.255 --> 31:07.387
MacGYVER:
Yes, ma'am.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.130
Go, go, go.

31:11.173 --> 31:12.392
Let's go.

31:12.435 --> 31:13.915
JACK:
Back! Back!

31:13.959 --> 31:15.177
BOZER:
Get back, get back, get back.

31:15.221 --> 31:17.092
Get back!

31:18.398 --> 31:19.703
Everybody, settle back!

31:19.747 --> 31:20.835
Get inside right now!

31:20.879 --> 31:21.923
Get back!
You want to die today?!

31:21.967 --> 31:23.925
BOZER:
Go, go, go!Get back!

31:23.969 --> 31:26.667
JACK:
I'm gonna go round up
the rest of the stragglers.

31:26.710 --> 31:27.711
Keep your hands up!

31:27.755 --> 31:29.191
Keep 'em up!

31:31.802 --> 31:32.847
You, in the blue dress!

31:34.022 --> 31:35.676
You look good.

31:38.461 --> 31:40.637
I'm coming up empty
in the lobby. Riley?

31:45.338 --> 31:47.296
Hey, guys, I got it right here.

31:47.340 --> 31:48.645
MATTY:
Riley, say again.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.473
You found the tablet?Yeah, I got it.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.954
The tablet was right here
in the game room, on the table.

31:52.998 --> 31:54.956
Wait, it's just
sitting on the table?

31:55.000 --> 31:56.262
I guess the killer ditched it.

31:56.305 --> 31:57.437
That doesn't sound right.
I'm coming to you.

31:59.700 --> 32:02.572
Riles? Riley?

32:02.616 --> 32:04.270
Matty, we got a problem.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.362
Back to the ballroom, Grandma.

32:09.405 --> 32:11.059
All of you! Now, let's go!

32:11.103 --> 32:12.495
Go, go, go.

32:12.539 --> 32:14.149
Keep your hands up!JACK:
Go, go, go, go, go!

32:14.193 --> 32:16.108
Get in there!

32:16.151 --> 32:17.413
Let's go!

32:20.503 --> 32:22.288
Riley.

32:22.331 --> 32:24.420
MATTY:
What's going on, Mac?
I need an update.

32:24.464 --> 32:26.248
Yeah, I found her,
she's unconscious.

32:26.292 --> 32:28.642
And her pulse is racing.

32:30.557 --> 32:32.515
She's got a fresh puncture mark
on her arm.

32:32.559 --> 32:33.560
What?

32:35.649 --> 32:36.867
Mac, Mac, are you, uh,

32:36.911 --> 32:38.913
are you saying Riley's
been poisoned?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.175
Yeah. Whoever attacked Alonzo

32:40.219 --> 32:41.568
also got to Riley.

32:41.611 --> 32:42.612
How long does she have?

32:42.656 --> 32:43.700
Well, considering she's half

32:43.744 --> 32:44.919
his size, not long.

32:55.930 --> 32:58.019
What's going on, Mac?
How's she doing?

32:58.063 --> 33:00.456
She's barely breathing.

33:00.500 --> 33:01.414
Seriously?

33:01.457 --> 33:03.285
Mac, but you can
help her, right?

33:03.329 --> 33:05.984
Yeah, I just need to gather
a few things.

33:14.209 --> 33:15.602
BOZER:
Mac,

33:15.645 --> 33:16.646
please tell me
all that banging means

33:16.690 --> 33:17.778
you found everything you need.

33:17.821 --> 33:21.825
I have everything
except one thing.

33:21.869 --> 33:23.349
Blood.

33:23.392 --> 33:25.568
Blood? Whose blood?

33:26.917 --> 33:28.310
Mine.

33:28.354 --> 33:29.920
BOZER:
Do we even want
to know what you're doing?

33:29.964 --> 33:31.487
Yeah. The key to making
an antidote

33:31.531 --> 33:34.360
to a cyanide-based poison lies
in the 3-MP amino acid

33:34.403 --> 33:36.797
found in the human body,
which helps us process

33:36.840 --> 33:41.541
natural levels of cyanide
found in fruits and vegetables.

33:49.201 --> 33:50.724
Muriatic acid
from tile cleaner,

33:50.767 --> 33:53.118
sulfur from match heads,
hydrogen peroxide,

33:53.161 --> 33:56.121
and blood-- in this case, mine.

33:57.644 --> 33:59.950
Mix everything in a pot,
heat it,

33:59.994 --> 34:02.083
strain it,
and though it seems gross,

34:02.127 --> 34:05.739
you've actually made an antidote for cyanide poisoning.

34:09.395 --> 34:11.527
Breathe it in like
a nasal spray, and hopefully

34:11.571 --> 34:13.181
Riley doesn't die.

34:13.225 --> 34:15.401
Sorry, Riles.
This is gonna suck.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.795
What's happening, Mac?

34:19.840 --> 34:21.102
Talk to us.

34:32.113 --> 34:35.160
She's okay. She's okay.

34:39.947 --> 34:41.427
I don't feel so good.

34:41.470 --> 34:43.385
Yeah, it's because
you've been poisoned.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.083
The killer used
the tablet

34:45.126 --> 34:46.345
as a trap,
and then they ambushed you.

34:46.388 --> 34:47.737
Did you happen to get
a good look at 'em?

34:47.781 --> 34:51.045
No, they came up
from behind.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.526
Well, whoever they are,
they still have the tablet.

34:53.569 --> 34:55.354
MATTY:
And they're still
in the building.

34:55.397 --> 34:57.965
Riley, is there anything
you remember?

35:00.098 --> 35:02.404
I saw the tablet on the table,

35:02.448 --> 35:03.753
I went to get it.

35:05.146 --> 35:07.235
There was a flash of light.

35:07.279 --> 35:09.237
Pretty sure
I was hit by a stun gun.

35:09.281 --> 35:11.152
A stun gun?

35:11.196 --> 35:13.633
Guys, I think I know how
to unmask our killer.

35:13.676 --> 35:15.852
Jack, Bozer, go separate
the wedding party

35:15.896 --> 35:17.115
from the rest of the guests.

35:19.508 --> 35:21.380
Get over there!You! Over there!

35:28.300 --> 35:29.431
CAMILA:
Hey,

35:29.475 --> 35:31.303
why are we
being kept here?

35:32.652 --> 35:35.829
I don't know how
to tell you this, but...

35:35.872 --> 35:37.700
your father has been murdered.

35:44.272 --> 35:45.969
MacGYVER:
We still don't know who it is.

35:46.013 --> 35:47.188
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.407
That's why you're all
still in here.

35:49.973 --> 35:51.801
ABUELA:
The building was full

35:51.845 --> 35:54.282
of armed men hunting for my son.

35:54.326 --> 35:55.588
You didn't catch even one?

35:55.631 --> 35:57.372
Actually, we
caught them all,

35:57.416 --> 35:59.461
but none of them
murdered your son.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.071
Alonzo was poisoned.

36:01.115 --> 36:02.595
No.It was introduced by a
puncture wound to his neck,

36:02.638 --> 36:05.163
which means that
whoever did this,

36:05.206 --> 36:07.034
they got close. It was
someone that he trusted.

36:07.077 --> 36:09.645
You think it was someone
I invited to my wedding?

36:09.689 --> 36:11.212
MATTY:
The killer had
to have known

36:11.256 --> 36:13.301
that Alonzo struck a deal
with the U.S. government.

36:13.345 --> 36:14.998
Whoever it was had a lot to lose

36:15.042 --> 36:17.436
if Alonzo shut down
his organization.

36:17.479 --> 36:20.613
My dad made a deal?

36:20.656 --> 36:21.701
Yes.

36:21.744 --> 36:23.877
We were gonna take
him into custody

36:23.920 --> 36:25.052
after your wedding.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.142
But why would he do that?

36:28.186 --> 36:30.579
Because he was
tired of running,

36:30.623 --> 36:32.755
and because he wanted
to be here for you,

36:32.799 --> 36:34.453
to walk you down the aisle.

36:35.802 --> 36:38.413
S-So someone killed him

36:38.457 --> 36:40.415
for wanting to do what's right?

36:40.459 --> 36:44.158
Yes, but they didn't
just poison Alonzo.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.073
They also poisoned my friend,
and that second attack

36:46.116 --> 36:47.770
is how we're gonna ID them.

36:47.814 --> 36:49.250
How?Well, when Riley
was attacked,

36:49.294 --> 36:52.035
there was a strange interference

36:52.079 --> 36:54.864
on our comm channels...

36:54.908 --> 36:57.519
which means the killer...

36:59.086 --> 37:00.435
...is using a stun gun.

37:00.479 --> 37:01.697
But they were
also carrying

37:01.741 --> 37:03.046
a device that reacted

37:03.090 --> 37:05.048
to the electrical charge
in the stun gun

37:05.092 --> 37:08.051
by broadcasting feedback.

37:08.095 --> 37:09.879
Don't have a stun gun on me,
but microphones

37:09.923 --> 37:12.142
pretty much use
the same frequency, so...

37:41.607 --> 37:44.305
My grandmother?
Is this a joke?

37:44.349 --> 37:46.438
It's not.
This medical alert bracelet

37:46.481 --> 37:48.309
was what caused the feedback
that we heard.

37:48.353 --> 37:50.572
That's a lovely ring.

37:54.141 --> 37:56.448
A poison ring tipped
with cyanide.

37:56.491 --> 38:00.278
This is the murder weapon,
and this is the murderer.

38:11.158 --> 38:13.116
CAMILA:
Abuela? Please tell me

38:13.160 --> 38:15.162
that this isn't true.

38:17.338 --> 38:22.125
Your abueloand I started
this business from nothing.

38:22.169 --> 38:23.779
Why?

38:23.823 --> 38:28.044
And I promised him years ago I'd
never let anything destroy it.

38:28.088 --> 38:30.438
Even your own son?

38:30.482 --> 38:33.485
Especially my own son.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.138
He, of all people,

38:35.182 --> 38:36.314
should have known.

38:36.357 --> 38:37.837
Don't you see,

38:37.880 --> 38:39.665
mi nieta?

38:39.708 --> 38:42.494
This is your abuelo'slegacy,

38:42.537 --> 38:44.670
and your father was gonna
burn it all down.

38:46.062 --> 38:48.630
I think you mean
didburn it all down.

38:51.720 --> 38:54.680
Your organization is going to be
completely wiped out.

38:54.723 --> 38:56.595
You and everyone in it

38:56.638 --> 38:59.946
are going to jail
for a very, very long time.

39:03.166 --> 39:05.125
What do you mean, he's recalled?

39:05.168 --> 39:07.780
But not for, like, ever, right?

39:07.823 --> 39:10.086
Just a few days, maybe a week?

39:10.130 --> 39:12.088
MATTY:
His assignment
is open-ended.

39:12.132 --> 39:13.612
He'll be gone as
long as it takes

39:13.655 --> 39:15.396
to catch Tiberius Kovac.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.876
Kovac is one
of the most

39:16.919 --> 39:18.791
dangerous terrorists
in the world.

39:18.834 --> 39:20.706
Last time it took years
to put him away.

39:22.925 --> 39:25.406
You knew.

39:25.450 --> 39:28.714
He told me a couple days ago.

39:30.019 --> 39:31.717
You weren't gonna say anything?

39:31.760 --> 39:33.675
He told me not to.

39:33.719 --> 39:35.329
He didn't want, uh,

39:35.373 --> 39:38.114
everyone to be distracted
when we were on the mission.

39:38.158 --> 39:41.988
Okay, so when does he leave?

39:42.031 --> 39:43.381
JACK:
Right now.

39:43.424 --> 39:48.386
Plane's, uh, wheels up in-in 20.

39:48.429 --> 39:51.693
I just wanted to come by
and say goodbye to everybody.

39:51.737 --> 39:52.999
Give me some, Boze.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.044
Come on.

39:57.090 --> 39:58.483
You be careful out there, Jack.

39:58.526 --> 39:59.658
I will.

39:59.701 --> 40:01.355
You're a good man.

40:02.617 --> 40:04.837
And, hey, do me a favor
and, you know,

40:04.880 --> 40:07.056
keep track
of my Bruce Willis collection

40:07.100 --> 40:08.841
for me, will you?I mean, of course,

40:08.884 --> 40:12.018
but you know those old VHS tapes
aren't worth anything.

40:12.061 --> 40:14.107
They mean a lot to me.

40:14.150 --> 40:15.891
Now that I think on it,

40:15.935 --> 40:17.240
they're probably
collector's items.

40:17.284 --> 40:20.592
Okay? I'll be sure to
keep an eye on them.

40:20.635 --> 40:21.941
Thanks, man.

40:21.984 --> 40:23.290
Yeah.

40:23.333 --> 40:25.248
MATTY:
You come back to us, Jack.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.729
That's an order.

40:27.773 --> 40:29.731
Yes, ma'am.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.085
Ri...

40:37.739 --> 40:39.393
Why didn't you tell me?I'm sorry.

40:39.437 --> 40:40.873
I didn't want you to worry.

40:40.916 --> 40:43.745
But if something
should happen to me,

40:43.789 --> 40:47.532
I want you to know
that I love you, honey.

40:47.575 --> 40:51.057
Honey, I lo-- I
love you so much

40:51.100 --> 40:55.583
and I'm so proud of the
woman you've become.

40:55.627 --> 40:58.238
I mean, pretty
impressive, yeah?

41:06.551 --> 41:11.947
You and me, pizza and Skee-Ball
when you get back, okay?

41:11.991 --> 41:13.471
Yeah, I promise.

41:13.514 --> 41:16.169
I promise.

41:26.048 --> 41:27.180
Look, I know,

41:27.223 --> 41:29.661
uh, uh, it's my turn,

41:29.704 --> 41:31.401
but I don't really have
a speech prepared.

41:31.445 --> 41:32.533
Why don't you
just promise me

41:32.577 --> 41:34.230
that you'll stay here
at the Phoenix,

41:34.274 --> 41:36.668
saving the world one mission
at a time, how about that?

41:36.711 --> 41:40.454
That I can do. Promise.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.152
I'll see you
on the other side, I guess.

41:43.196 --> 41:44.589
Yeah.

41:44.632 --> 41:49.202
I'm, uh... I'm sorry
I got to leave like this.

41:49.245 --> 41:50.856
Okay, look, you're
hunting down a man

41:50.899 --> 41:51.944
who's hurt thousands
of innocent people

41:51.987 --> 41:53.336
and plans on doing it to more,

41:53.380 --> 41:56.383
so you wouldn't really be
yourself if you didn't.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.649
You just keep thinking, Butch.

42:01.693 --> 42:03.042
That's what you're good at.
