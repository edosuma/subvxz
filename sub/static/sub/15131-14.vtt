Thanks.

00:12.306 --> 00:14.212
Finally writing that novel?

00:15.050 --> 00:18.164
- I'm trying to write a speech.
- For?

00:18.519 --> 00:21.449
My father's receiving a 
Bernard Taylor Innovation award tonight

00:21.531 --> 00:23.055
- and I'm introducing him.
- He really racks those things up,

00:23.129 --> 00:24.442
- doesn't he?
- Four times now.

00:24.492 --> 00:28.377
- This one's for his stem cell research.
- Okay, let me have a look.

00:29.664 --> 00:32.662
- "Doctor Barret Goran is my father."
- That's as far as I got.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.878
Okay, well, I hate public speaking

00:34.928 --> 00:36.708
and I've written maybe
three speeches in my life...

00:36.765 --> 00:38.503
But it seems a little short.

00:38.578 --> 00:41.340
- I have no idea what to write.
- Just write something nice about your dad.

00:41.390 --> 00:42.582
Like what?

00:42.643 --> 00:45.243
- Well, he's very charming.
- Did I mention he abandoned my mother

00:45.314 --> 00:47.376
- and humiliated my family?
- Yeah, I wouldn't put that in the speech.

00:47.591 --> 00:50.950
- That's probably not a good idea, right? O... kay.
- (Phone buzzing)

00:51.319 --> 00:53.791
Speak of prince charming.

00:55.917 --> 01:00.678
Hi, dad. Yeah. Got to pick him up, hotel.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.526
Good luck.

01:04.443 --> 01:09.166
Yep! Sorry. I can't lift my arm past there.

01:09.651 --> 01:13.489
Isn't that right, darling?
(Groaning) (Sighing)

01:13.692 --> 01:15.969
Okay. And you're torn your
rotator cuff how many times now?

01:16.050 --> 01:16.908
Twice.

01:17.136 --> 01:20.986
Tennis is all I have,
besides Cameron of course.

01:21.112 --> 01:22.563
- And Cameron's your... ?
- He's my grandson.

01:22.636 --> 01:23.714
- He lives with me.
- Right.

01:23.775 --> 01:25.360
- Can you feel that?
- Yep! Mm-hmm.

01:25.450 --> 01:27.584
- Okay.
- (Gasping)

01:27.819 --> 01:29.820
Okay, why don't you grab a seat.

01:29.887 --> 01:30.687
(Soft groaning)

01:31.085 --> 01:33.591
- This wasn't a tennis injury.
- No, no.

01:33.670 --> 01:36.244
I just sort of spaced out

01:36.301 --> 01:37.527
and I fell in the living room.

01:37.809 --> 01:40.354
I really wrenched my shoulder awfully.

01:40.862 --> 01:41.980
You know, it's a small miracle

01:42.030 --> 01:43.570
I didn't hit my head on the coffee table.

01:43.676 --> 01:45.070
Mrs. Pratt, I hate to be the one

- to tell you this but...
- If you're gonna tell me

01:46.668 --> 01:49.335
I have to give up tennis for good I'll die.

01:49.900 --> 01:53.295
Sorry. He hates it when I talk about death.

01:53.845 --> 01:54.444
Mrs. Pratt...

01:54.494 --> 01:55.763
Please, call me Iris.

01:55.813 --> 01:58.381
Iris. Uh...

01:58.637 --> 02:00.706
I'm gonna get an X-ray to confirm this but,

02:00.756 --> 02:02.702
um, my guess is that three time's a charm

02:02.752 --> 02:04.918
and you're gonna need
a shoulder replacement.

02:04.988 --> 02:06.155
You see, gran?

02:06.854 --> 02:10.979
- I warned her.
- Um...

02:11.328 --> 02:15.965
Doctor, if I have this surgery,
who's gonna look after Cameron?

02:18.375 --> 02:20.835
Well, that's not really
my department, but um...

02:20.900 --> 02:23.876
Once you're admitted here
he could stay with you.

02:24.142 --> 02:25.507
Thank you very much.

02:27.820 --> 02:28.678
Yeah.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.152

02:38.992 --> 02:41.191
I'm sorry. I'm gonna

Joe! Let me just get some pants on.

02:44.139 --> 02:45.925
This is Marion, by the way.

02:45.975 --> 02:48.164
Your dad is a loyal customer.

02:48.436 --> 02:51.026
Yeah, I'm sure he is. You
look like you could use some...

02:51.217 --> 02:52.293
Shiatsu.

02:53.331 --> 02:54.935
I make house calls.

02:54.985 --> 02:56.270
Yes, I'm sure you do.

02:58.921 --> 03:00.816
She's the best, Joe.

03:04.304 --> 03:07.356
Patient's 33 weeks pregnant and
complaining of severe back pain.

03:07.406 --> 03:08.653
You thinking appendicitis?

03:08.703 --> 03:10.784
- I'd like to rule it out.
- What about the baby?

03:10.919 --> 03:13.601
Fetal heart rate's normal and
the cervix hasn't begun to efface.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.055
Okay, so this isn't pre-term labour.

03:15.223 --> 03:18.082
No, which is a relief. The baby has CDH.

03:18.257 --> 03:19.893
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia?

03:20.001 --> 03:22.225
I'm impressed. CDH is rare.

03:22.437 --> 03:24.567
- Well, I'm pregnant. I surf the Internet.
- Don't do that.

03:24.628 --> 03:27.395
CDH causes the baby's intestines to
push through the herniated diaphragm,

03:27.445 --> 03:28.875
preventing the lungs from developing.

03:28.925 --> 03:30.501
Unless they've had a lifesaving balloon

03:30.551 --> 03:32.538
placed in their trachea
until the lung's develop.

03:32.541 --> 03:33.840
Now I feel so much better.

03:33.934 --> 03:35.471
It must be a little weird being up here

03:35.521 --> 03:37.743
among all the pregnant women
and their complications.

03:37.793 --> 03:40.714
Mm, I'm a doctor, it's a
hospital; Just trying to do my job.

Her pain is getting much worse.

03:44.362 --> 03:47.631
Ruth. My wife has a flare
for the dramatic. I'm fine.

03:47.790 --> 03:50.318
Ruth, Neshema, this is Doctor
Reid. She's a general surgeon.

03:50.368 --> 03:50.868
Hi there.

03:50.918 --> 03:52.335
Hi. Mazel tov.

03:52.385 --> 03:54.293
What? Oh, right. Thank you.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.689
First, let me put you at ease about
the baby's herniated diaphragm.

03:57.739 --> 04:00.881
I've paged the staff OB to come and
answer any questions you might have.

04:00.946 --> 04:02.802
Yes, please. I have questions.

04:02.852 --> 04:03.836
Of course you do.

04:04.475 --> 04:06.194
This is...

04:06.917 --> 04:09.137
The baby's mouth, throat,

04:09.187 --> 04:11.057
and this is the balloon and her trachea.

04:11.138 --> 04:13.779
Doctor Hodges placed it
perfectly. The baby's fine.

04:13.829 --> 04:15.350
Neshema, can I feel your back, please?

04:15.480 --> 04:16.387
Sure.

04:17.159 --> 04:18.346
You should not have left Montreal.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.733
Doctor Hodges told us to
stay close to his clinic

04:20.786 --> 04:23.147
just in case I go into premature labour.

04:23.420 --> 04:24.697
- Sensitivity there?
- Yeah.

04:24.747 --> 04:27.059
But it was my Zadie's unveiling
and she didn't want me to miss it.

04:27.109 --> 04:30.194
Ruth's family has just been so great to us.

04:30.303 --> 04:31.649
What do you see, Doctor Reid?

04:31.755 --> 04:32.904
Should I take a look too?

04:32.954 --> 04:36.715
Ruth, just leave the doctoring
to the actual real doctors.

04:36.816 --> 04:39.483
It's difficult to see anything
near your appendix Neshema

04:39.533 --> 04:41.378
because there's too much gas in the region.

04:41.748 --> 04:45.610
So do Ruth and I try to get on
our train back to Montreal, then?

04:45.736 --> 04:47.399
With the amount of pain you're
in I wouldn't recommend it.

04:47.464 --> 04:50.465
I'll send you up for imaging after Doctor
Katz arrives to get a better picture.

04:50.546 --> 04:51.482
Doctor Katz?

04:51.745 --> 04:52.784
Our staff OB.

04:53.258 --> 04:54.484
Right on cue.

comes near me or my baby.

05:04.259 --> 05:06.158
You get her out of here.

05:06.483 --> 05:07.296
Now!

05:07.394 --> 05:13.102
♪

05:19.712 --> 05:21.947
So you and Neshema know each other.

05:21.997 --> 05:23.179
She hates your guts.

05:23.229 --> 05:25.053
She just doesn't want me
treating her, that's all.

05:25.103 --> 05:25.801
Yeah, but...

05:25.851 --> 05:27.381
It's a patient's right to
choose their practitioner.

05:27.384 --> 05:29.051
Well, we'll take it from here.

05:29.291 --> 05:30.746
She's just off the case?

05:30.848 --> 05:32.742
Doctor Hodges has been
treating her baby's CDH,

05:32.792 --> 05:35.847
you're a general surgeon and,
Doctor Lin, you're a talented OB.

05:35.897 --> 05:37.654
I'm not needed here.

05:39.828 --> 05:41.195
(Whistling)

05:46.277 --> 05:48.105
So I take it that was an actual masseuse?

05:48.155 --> 05:51.199
Yeah, she was, and an
extremely effective one.

05:51.249 --> 05:52.061
- She rubbed me...
- Honestly,

05:52.111 --> 05:54.752
I don't want to know
the details. Thank you.

05:55.823 --> 05:56.968
Where do you want to go for lunch?

05:57.018 --> 05:58.749
Well, wherever we went
when I was here last time...

05:58.827 --> 06:01.498
We didn't go anywhere last
time. You canceled on me.

06:01.710 --> 06:03.514
Well, you pick. Okay?

06:03.629 --> 06:06.129
I'll have to come back for
a nap before the ceremony.

06:06.271 --> 06:07.885
- I didn't sleep much last night.
- Dad.

06:07.995 --> 06:09.751
I don't want the details of this.

06:09.816 --> 06:10.682
It was jet lag.

06:10.768 --> 06:13.882
Okay. Well, I'll bring you
back so you can have a nap.

06:14.484 --> 06:16.724
- Okay.
- So how's the speech coming?

06:16.850 --> 06:20.196
- Do up your shirt, dad.
- (Elevator bell dings)

06:24.936 --> 06:27.042
So your grandmother's gone to imaging.

06:27.092 --> 06:30.490
- (Gasps)
- Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

06:31.010 --> 06:34.019
- You didn't. It's okay.
- Okay.

06:36.478 --> 06:39.158
I wanted to talk to you privately.

06:39.564 --> 06:42.126
- Why?
- Well...

06:43.313 --> 06:47.500
Your grandmother, she been straining
herself more than usual lately?

06:49.525 --> 06:51.855
She's always running for the phone.

06:52.529 --> 06:55.668
I don't know how many times
I've warned her, told her,

06:55.770 --> 06:59.323
"if you run for that stupid
phone again you're gonna pay."

07:00.104 --> 07:04.202
- And that's how she... fell?
- I warned her.

07:04.763 --> 07:06.474
She was asking for it.

07:07.483 --> 07:09.832
Sounds like you warn her a lot.

07:11.044 --> 07:12.361
Yeah.

you where you need to go.

07:42.438 --> 07:44.971
No? (Ding)

07:46.272 --> 07:48.728
- Hi!
- Hi.

07:48.813 --> 07:52.686
- That's was kinda weird.
- Yeah, kinda.

07:52.736 --> 07:54.497
I didn't know I could do that.

07:54.586 --> 07:58.518
- Uh, yeah, that's because you're, um...
- Invisible.

07:58.851 --> 08:00.969
Kinda awesome.

08:01.486 --> 08:02.823
Yeah.

08:03.405 --> 08:05.112
Kinda awesome.

08:07.283 --> 08:10.038
Will you still help me
get back where I belong?

08:10.088 --> 08:11.337
Yeah, of course.

08:11.633 --> 08:13.620
What's the last thing you remember?

08:13.670 --> 08:14.829
I'm not dead?

08:15.044 --> 08:16.925
Well, that's good. That's a good start.

08:16.975 --> 08:19.317
So we just need to find your body, then.

08:19.390 --> 08:21.083
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:21.362 --> 08:24.452
I mean, it's got to be
around here somewhere.

08:26.477 --> 08:27.875
Okay, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.554
See those nurses there?

08:29.907 --> 08:32.815
When they clear out, I'm
gonna jump over that counter

08:32.865 --> 08:35.966
and I'm gonna look in their computer
and find out what room you're in.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.787
So what's your name?

08:37.868 --> 08:40.347
- Henry.
- Henry what?

08:40.746 --> 08:44.333
I can't remember! Why can't I remember?

08:44.508 --> 08:47.775
I don't know, Henry.
Um... it doesn't matter.

08:47.906 --> 08:49.810
Not too many kids named Henry nowadays.

08:50.411 --> 08:54.112
I know three kids named Henry
and they're all in my class too.

08:55.029 --> 08:56.292
Or everyone's named Henry...

08:56.342 --> 09:00.408
You know, one or the other.
Uh, I'm Charlie, by the way.

09:05.222 --> 09:07.962
Charlie, wait! I think I found me!

09:13.381 --> 09:16.609
Okay, thanks for your help
and everything, Charlie.

09:20.992 --> 09:22.626
Uh...

09:24.151 --> 09:27.029
Yeah, I don't mean to
burst your bubble but, um...

09:27.115 --> 09:29.501
This kid's name is Josh.

09:30.782 --> 09:33.559
I could have sworn that it was me.

09:33.977 --> 09:35.737
Yeah, well, um...

09:35.787 --> 09:38.608
First of all, he doesn't
really look like you, and...

09:39.836 --> 09:41.767
You probably wouldn't
be here with me like...

09:41.817 --> 09:45.462
A spirit or whatever if,
uh, you were awake like that.

09:45.532 --> 09:47.475
(Whispers)

09:48.748 --> 09:49.874
Henry!

09:50.234 --> 09:51.474
Okay, what do we have?

09:51.524 --> 09:53.321
She's been vomiting and
she's running a high fever.

09:53.382 --> 09:54.529
Her appendix burst, didn't it?

09:54.579 --> 09:56.932
Ruthie, please. Just go for a walk.

09:57.001 --> 09:58.956
Neshema, we're gonna get
you in for surgery right now.

09:59.058 --> 10:02.587
We'll do a minimally invasive appendectomy
totally safe for pregnant women.

10:03.124 --> 10:04.822
- I love you!
- It's okay. It's okay.

10:04.872 --> 10:05.950
Okay, let's go.

10:11.328 --> 10:13.443
Alright. I'm just gonna cinch the loop.

10:14.227 --> 10:15.772
No need to put in a drain?

10:15.898 --> 10:17.447
No. Her appendix wasn't perforated.

10:17.497 --> 10:19.496
- I'm not worried about her getting an abscess.
- Okay.

10:21.016 --> 10:22.382
Just checking in.

10:22.459 --> 10:24.252
We're just finishing up here.

10:24.549 --> 10:27.517
- How's the baby?
- No signs of distress. Baby's fine.

10:27.749 --> 10:29.684
Good to hear she's out of the woods.

10:31.904 --> 10:33.693
What is that about?

10:34.176 --> 10:35.280
We'll never know.

10:35.331 --> 10:39.478
She is a mystery wrapped
in a long dowdy skirt.

10:46.971 --> 10:51.504
- Appendix is out. How's the baby?
- Baby's show.

10:51.748 --> 10:52.691
Let's close.

10:52.756 --> 10:54.530
(Siren wailing)

10:54.976 --> 10:56.900
So how is my
26-year-old stepmother?

10:56.950 --> 10:58.428
She didn't want to come.

10:59.753 --> 11:01.378
What has happened?

11:01.428 --> 11:03.282
- She's filing for divorce.
- (Scoffs)

11:03.692 --> 11:07.356
Look, it's amicable,
there are no hard feelings.

11:07.656 --> 11:10.641
Which is distinctly less
hysteria than with your mother.

11:10.734 --> 11:12.450
Hey, dad, let's leave mom out of this.

11:12.717 --> 11:15.975
Congratulations, anyway, that's
a quintet of failed marriages.

11:17.686 --> 11:20.321
- Hey, what's going on?
- No, I'm just dizzy.

11:20.451 --> 11:22.910
- What... are you feeling sick?
- (Gulping)

11:23.358 --> 11:27.186
- No... no, I'm fine, I'm fine.
- You're obviously not fine.

11:27.236 --> 11:28.975
Give me this. Where's the Insulin?

11:29.025 --> 11:31.370
I don't use Insulin any more. I'm cured.

11:31.420 --> 11:33.583
What do you mean, you're... hey!

11:33.633 --> 11:34.977
(Groaning)

11:37.587 --> 11:39.441
Taxi!

11:43.185 --> 11:44.653
Over here, ladies.

11:47.101 --> 11:48.229
- You got my page?
- Yes.

11:48.414 --> 11:50.531
- That's great.
- Aaron, it's nice to see you

11:50.581 --> 11:52.097
again, I'm sorry you're not feeling well.

11:52.223 --> 11:53.817
Let's start an IV and push some fluids.

11:53.919 --> 11:55.297
Let's get him some
insulin, too, he's diabetic.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.964
- No, no, no insulin... it's just jet lag...
- You're being ridiculous, stop it.

11:59.106 --> 12:00.757
It's a little more
acute than jet lag, okay?

12:00.867 --> 12:02.135
We're going to do a blood sugar test.

12:02.241 --> 12:06.144
Let's draw some blood and send
for a CDC, electrolytes, LFTs, MRIs.

12:06.197 --> 12:07.988
- Let's get him a catheter too.
- Oh come on!

12:08.038 --> 12:09.993
Look I understand, but it's
necessary. Put in a Foley, please.

12:10.043 --> 12:11.672
I've got to be out of here by 7:00.

12:11.722 --> 12:13.505
The Bernard Taylor awards. Congratulations.

12:13.555 --> 12:15.458
Alex, you're expecting?

12:16.015 --> 12:17.969
- I am.
- You look absolutely beautiful.

12:18.019 --> 12:20.303
I just wish Joe hadn't screwed things up...

12:20.353 --> 12:21.214
Alright, that's enough.

12:21.264 --> 12:23.263
That Charlie Harris is a lucky man.

12:23.313 --> 12:25.565
- Have a word for a second?
- Yes.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.224
I didn't mention the pregnancy
to dad for obvious reasons.

12:29.456 --> 12:31.289
Absolutely, I understand.

12:32.895 --> 12:33.583
Okay.

12:35.871 --> 12:39.721
- Multiple fractures everywhere.
- Looks like elder abuse.

12:39.815 --> 12:43.385
- Should probably report it.
- Eh, let me

12:43.462 --> 12:46.420
talk to the grandmother alone before
I freak her out with a case worker.

12:46.470 --> 12:47.804
Yeah, fair enough.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.955
<i>Doctor Ortega to Orthopedics,</i>

12:52.138 --> 12:55.959
<i>Doctor Ortega to Orthopedics.
(Intercom beeping)</i>

12:57.301 --> 12:57.517
Hi.

12:59.753 --> 13:01.796
Cameron, um, I need to
speak with your grandmother.

13:01.846 --> 13:02.683
Could you give us a few minutes?

13:02.733 --> 13:06.221
- He can stay and listen.
- Yeah, how private can shoulder surgery be?

13:06.271 --> 13:07.449
It won't take long.

13:07.546 --> 13:10.693
Actually, there's a great little coffee
shop down on the first floor, if you want.

13:10.743 --> 13:11.989
No, that's stupid.

13:12.087 --> 13:15.747
- I'll just go outside the door.
- Okay.

13:21.854 --> 13:23.021
Thank you.

13:27.386 --> 13:28.858
So...

13:30.724 --> 13:33.822
Iris, um... I took a look at your X-ray.

13:34.220 --> 13:36.066
Actually, I saw a picture
of your entire skeleton.

13:36.127 --> 13:40.423
- How macabre.
- And, uh, what bothers me is

13:40.473 --> 13:42.677
all the hairline fractures I'm seeing.

13:44.352 --> 13:46.324
What's that mean, my bones are breaking?

13:46.568 --> 13:48.779
I don't think this is news to you, Iris.

13:49.633 --> 13:51.258
Now's the time to talk about it.

13:52.642 --> 13:56.764
I... I... I just seem to be
falling down all the time.

13:58.890 --> 14:01.158
How does your grandson treat you?

14:01.160 --> 14:03.761
- I mean, overall?
- Oh, like gold.

14:03.863 --> 14:06.265
- He helps out around the house.
- All right.

14:06.395 --> 14:07.964
Does he ever get physical with you?

14:08.225 --> 14:10.066
- When he's angry, or frustrated?
- No... no, never.

14:11.075 --> 14:13.407
Pushes you, shoves you, throws you,

14:13.457 --> 14:14.755
- anything like that?
- No. Never.

14:15.805 --> 14:16.982
You don't know him.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.431
No, you... no one understands...

14:18.481 --> 14:21.056
Look, do you have a phone I can
have, I need phones for my grandma,

14:21.106 --> 14:22.467
I need phones for my grandma,

14:22.517 --> 14:25.147
give me a phone, look, I need it for
my grandma, do you have a phone...

14:25.199 --> 14:28.383
- Cameron, stop.
- Grandma, I got you a phone!

14:28.497 --> 14:29.881
Good, that's good.

14:29.975 --> 14:32.347
You don't need to use the
phone anymore because...

14:32.424 --> 14:33.542
No, no!

14:33.592 --> 14:35.165
- Leave my boy alone!
- Iris, Iris...

14:35.216 --> 14:36.255
- I know how to...
- It's okay, it's okay!

14:36.305 --> 14:37.155
- Please...
- (Shrieking) Gran, gran!

14:37.205 --> 14:38.546
- It's okay.
- Gran, gran!

14:38.596 --> 14:40.273
- They won't hurt him. They won't hurt him.
- Gran, gran!

14:40.323 --> 14:41.763
- Page Doctor Dey!
- Gran, gran!!

14:41.813 --> 14:43.582
- Cameron!
- They're not going to hurt him.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.033
It's gonna be okay, alright?

14:45.035 --> 14:46.649
(Screaming)

14:54.019 --> 14:56.736
(Machines beeping)

14:57.294 --> 14:59.149
(Knocking)

15:03.749 --> 15:05.597
Is it bad news?

15:05.717 --> 15:07.875
Severe pancreatitis.

15:08.480 --> 15:12.721
I ran an IV contrast. Look
how black his pancreas is.

15:13.218 --> 15:15.551
- It's necrotic.
- And infected.

15:15.570 --> 15:17.569
If you see all the bubbles
there, that's from the bacteria.

15:17.630 --> 15:19.677
- So you have to operate?
- Yes.

15:19.691 --> 15:20.837
I'm going to take him into the OR,

15:20.866 --> 15:22.959
try to get rid of as
much bacteria as possible.

15:23.076 --> 15:25.179
We don't want to risk him
going into septic shock.

15:26.798 --> 15:27.946
And it's strange...

15:28.019 --> 15:29.937
His blood sugar levels are normal.

15:30.175 --> 15:31.197
Isn't he diabetic?

15:31.317 --> 15:33.979
Yes, he's been taking insulin for years.

15:36.639 --> 15:37.947
You know, he mentioned something, actually,

15:37.967 --> 15:39.601
to me, on the way here. He said that...

15:41.079 --> 15:42.507
That he'd cured himself.

15:42.926 --> 15:44.586
No one can cure type 1 diabetes.

15:44.605 --> 15:46.039
I mean, are we sure that
the lab got it right?

15:46.058 --> 15:48.108
We've done a finger-stick
test every 15 minutes,

15:48.128 --> 15:50.008
and his blood glucose levels are normal.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.728
God, I hate him.

15:51.848 --> 15:52.775
He's right there.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.169
He's sleeping, Alex.

15:56.846 --> 15:58.004
And you don't hate him.

15:58.196 --> 15:59.379
You resent him.

16:06.101 --> 16:08.262
This boy's definitely not me.

16:08.930 --> 16:10.689
No, he's someone else.

16:11.833 --> 16:13.989
I thought for sure that I would be in here.

16:14.837 --> 16:17.497
Come on, keep your chin up.

16:18.476 --> 16:20.047
Maybe I'm dead.

16:20.057 --> 16:22.744
Maybe I died and I didn't even know it.

16:23.038 --> 16:24.703
Does that happen?

16:26.085 --> 16:28.148
I mean... if you were

16:28.394 --> 16:30.542
dead, would you really want to know?

16:31.205 --> 16:34.554
You've got to be pretty brave
to handle news like that.

16:34.674 --> 16:36.946
My dog died and I was only 5.

16:37.066 --> 16:38.727
I was really brave.

16:38.945 --> 16:42.238
I cried, but I went to
school anyway that day.

16:43.373 --> 16:45.493
Yeah, that's pretty brave.

16:47.991 --> 16:50.650
- Why don't you come with me?
- Where are we going?

16:50.679 --> 16:52.278
You'll see.

16:52.307 --> 16:54.256
Okay, we'll keep you for a few more hours,

16:54.284 --> 16:56.953
monitor you and baby, and then
you can make your way home.

16:59.035 --> 17:00.700
- Doctor?
- What?

17:01.987 --> 17:05.407
- (Gasping) Doctors?
- Okay, uh...

17:05.441 --> 17:07.627
alright, Neshema, your water just broke.

17:07.637 --> 17:09.162
What? That's not supposed to happen.

17:09.198 --> 17:10.767
- You're in labour.
- What? No,

17:10.803 --> 17:13.882
no, no, she can't be in labour,
the baby's lungs aren't ready...

17:13.892 --> 17:15.546
the balloon, it's still in her trachea.

17:15.564 --> 17:17.229
So we're going to unplug,
we're going to go in,

17:17.241 --> 17:19.803
pop the balloon, deliver,
and ventilate baby.

17:19.923 --> 17:22.057
- (Gasping)
- Breathe, Ruthie, breathe.

17:22.093 --> 17:23.952
Try to stay calm, alright?

17:24.007 --> 17:25.346
We're just going to check the incision.

17:25.673 --> 17:27.750
Pauline, I need nifedipine for Neshema.

17:27.787 --> 17:30.172
I need to delay these contractions
until we've deflated the balloon.

17:30.209 --> 17:31.869
- Get Doctor Katz.
- No!!

17:31.924 --> 17:34.068
- Incision's ***
- Can I speak to you, privately?

17:34.328 --> 17:36.550
I'll be back in just a second, okay?

17:40.463 --> 17:42.395
I know Neshema hates her, I don't know why,

17:42.425 --> 17:44.503
- but we need Doctor Katz, don't we?
- Yeah.

17:44.552 --> 17:47.473
She's the only OB with experience
in this kind of fetoscopy.

17:47.725 --> 17:49.295
Then can you bring her in?

17:49.562 --> 17:50.671
I'll deal with my wife.

17:50.846 --> 17:51.529
Okay.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.373
So I'll be awake for the whole thing?

17:54.374 --> 17:55.623
You'll be awake but sedated.

17:55.638 --> 17:57.479
You can watch or you can
keep your eyes closed,

17:57.489 --> 17:59.161
if that makes you feel more comfortable.

17:59.782 --> 18:01.914
Doctor Lin, you've been filling
Neshema in on the procedure?

18:01.938 --> 18:03.682
What is she doing here?

18:03.687 --> 18:06.134
Neshema, I had to ask Doctor Katz
to take the lead on this, okay?

18:06.178 --> 18:07.728
No, I want Doctor Hodges to come.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.614
I'll pay for his flight.
We absolutely cannot wait

18:09.633 --> 18:10.743
for Doctor Hodges to fly in.

18:10.767 --> 18:12.827
- You'll just have to settle with me.
- Stop, where's Ruth?

18:12.841 --> 18:14.770
- I want my wife.
- She's scrubbing in, Neshema.

18:14.799 --> 18:17.542
I want to talk to my wife.
There has to be another option.

18:17.552 --> 18:19.649
There is no other option.
We have to do this now.

18:19.678 --> 18:21.815
- We don't have time.
- Your baby's life's at risk.

18:21.825 --> 18:22.872
I'm all you've got.

18:26.719 --> 18:28.904
Okay, this is the last one. So...

18:29.447 --> 18:32.616
if you're not in here, we're going to
have to look somewhere else, alright?

18:33.304 --> 18:34.156
Wait!

18:35.082 --> 18:36.361
Something's happening.

18:37.558 --> 18:39.297
- Something... ?
- Good.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.167
It's like I feel my heart beating.

18:41.856 --> 18:43.450
- Well, that's good, right?
- Yeah.

18:43.493 --> 18:45.252
- Do you love your parents?
- Yeah.

18:45.281 --> 18:47.248
- Do you have lots of friends?
- Two best friends,

18:47.278 --> 18:49.327
- and a few really good ones.
- Okay.

18:49.399 --> 18:51.981
- Well, get ready to see them again.
- How?

18:55.910 --> 18:56.922
That's how.

18:59.602 --> 19:02.141
So you're saying Cameron
suffers from mental illness?

19:02.194 --> 19:05.193
- Yeah, he's in a manic phase right now.
- Is he on meds?

19:05.313 --> 19:07.568
According to his medical
records, he's on lithium.

19:07.634 --> 19:10.215
Okay. Well, my patient
has multiple fractures.

19:10.245 --> 19:12.595
Well, my patient has
no history of violence.

19:12.631 --> 19:15.200
You say tomato, and I
say call Social Services.

19:15.212 --> 19:18.609
I'm not sure separating Cameron
from his grandmother is wise,

19:18.729 --> 19:22.207
- if that's what you're thinking.
- No, I'm thinking I need to look after my patient.

19:22.225 --> 19:23.798
That's what I'm thinking, bottom line.

19:24.242 --> 19:27.738
Right. Well, Cameron needs a stable home...

19:28.046 --> 19:29.936
And I'm needed in surgery, so,

19:30.056 --> 19:32.171
- we'll discuss this afterwards?
- Sure.

19:33.703 --> 19:35.738
(Siren wailing)

19:36.089 --> 19:38.663
They're coming to prep you
for surgery in a second.

19:39.287 --> 19:42.164
Well, I'm going to have to
finish writing my speech first,

19:42.527 --> 19:44.568
and you're going to have
to collect the award for me.

19:44.598 --> 19:45.343
(Scoffs)

19:46.397 --> 19:48.196
No, I don't think so.

19:48.609 --> 19:51.353
Just skip your introduction,

19:51.589 --> 19:53.564
and read out my acceptance speech.

19:53.582 --> 19:55.472
That's what they've come to hear anyway.

19:57.156 --> 20:00.067
- It would mean everything to me...
- Dad, cut it out!

20:00.275 --> 20:01.232
Honestly.

20:02.837 --> 20:05.587
Look, I've won this award three
times, but having you there...

20:05.599 --> 20:07.095
Stem cell research.

20:08.718 --> 20:10.154
How's that coming along for you?

20:10.444 --> 20:11.377
Well,

20:11.704 --> 20:13.477
I've just won another award for it, yes,

20:13.496 --> 20:14.941
so it's working out rather well.

20:14.955 --> 20:17.053
I meant you've been injecting yourself
with the cells, haven't you, dad?

20:21.109 --> 20:22.199
(Sighs)

20:22.272 --> 20:24.399
It cured my diabetes.

20:24.481 --> 20:26.893
- It'll cure others.
- And you volunteered for your own trial.

20:26.906 --> 20:29.030
- Yeah.
- And all in the name of compassion and a

20:29.049 --> 20:31.351
- benevolent desire to help others, I suppose.
- Of course.

20:31.362 --> 20:32.638
You know as well as I do

20:32.650 --> 20:35.103
that it takes mavericks who
are willing to risk everything

20:35.122 --> 20:36.959
- in the name...
- In the name of winning yet another award.

20:36.971 --> 20:39.727
- Don't be obtuse.
- Your arrogance is just so unbelievably staggering.

20:39.754 --> 20:41.793
Dad, do you understand why
there are government restrictions

20:41.801 --> 20:43.685
- on stem cell research?
- Because they're cowards.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.196
Because it's experimental!

20:45.223 --> 20:47.658
- These cells you are injecting yourself with...
- Transplanting.

20:47.677 --> 20:49.666
They are dangerous, and they can mutate!

20:49.677 --> 20:52.460
- They can save lives.
- You went too far.

20:52.487 --> 20:54.720
Would you ever let a patient
of yours get this sick?

20:54.740 --> 20:56.392
You sound just like your mother.

20:56.392 --> 20:57.810
Don't you dare mention my mother!

21:00.015 --> 21:01.644
You don't get to talk about her.

21:06.631 --> 21:09.430
If Alex can't remove all of
the infection in your pancreas,

21:09.601 --> 21:11.678
all of your other major
organs will progressively fail

21:11.697 --> 21:12.465
and you will die.

21:13.686 --> 21:15.927
You'd have done the same thing.

21:16.788 --> 21:18.838
You were a risk-taker, too.

21:19.730 --> 21:21.385
Okay, I'm just going to
remove the humeral head.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.528

21:24.019 --> 21:25.755

21:36.258 --> 21:39.901
Before we continue, I want
to get a closer look. Kocher?

21:42.888 --> 21:46.849
(Squishing) (Clink)

21:48.419 --> 21:49.691
(Beeping)

21:50.770 --> 21:53.278
Yeah, the inside of the
bone is spongy, and the

21:53.311 --> 21:54.663
outer shell is thin.

21:55.803 --> 21:57.162
Reamer.

21:57.826 --> 21:59.352
(Beeping)

22:04.587 --> 22:06.158
Way too soft.

22:06.512 --> 22:08.232
- Osteoporosis?
- I'm thinking not.

22:08.251 --> 22:11.451
Um, let's do a tox screen,
test for everything.

22:11.571 --> 22:14.317
- Okay.
- And let's get Doctor Dey down here.

22:14.575 --> 22:16.372
Isn't this a little outside of his purview?

22:19.257 --> 22:20.686
Page Doctor Dey.

22:21.498 --> 22:23.198
(Beeping)

22:24.377 --> 22:26.000
(Cranking)

22:31.565 --> 22:34.707
Okay, there's a blood vessel
on the right to watch out for.

22:35.319 --> 22:37.084
Just a little.

22:37.393 --> 22:38.894
(Beeping)

22:39.583 --> 22:41.921
Neshema, we've given you
something for your contractions,

22:41.953 --> 22:45.102
so if you feel the urge to push, don't.

22:45.714 --> 22:47.588
- Doctor Lin?
- Yeah?

22:47.781 --> 22:49.468
I love my wife.

22:50.834 --> 22:52.482
She saved me.

22:53.306 --> 22:55.541
She's my family.

22:55.915 --> 22:57.035
(Smooch)

22:57.155 --> 22:59.804
But there's something I
haven't told you, Ruth.

23:00.828 --> 23:03.791
It was Sydney Katz who told my mother.

23:06.007 --> 23:08.808
Neshema, it's a very delicate procedure.

23:08.847 --> 23:10.882
We need you to stay still, okay?

23:10.940 --> 23:14.740
Syd caught me kissing
a stupid girl. (Laughs)

23:15.171 --> 23:17.445
Okay, let's talk about this after, okay?

23:17.565 --> 23:20.459
She's so much more (Unclear)
than the rest of us.

23:21.516 --> 23:26.120
She ran straight to my mother
and told her I was lesbian.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.438
- Do you remember that, Sydney?
- Okay,

23:28.471 --> 23:30.602
I need you to be very still, please.

23:32.103 --> 23:34.176
I'm in the baby's neck.

23:35.587 --> 23:37.196
The trachea.

23:39.508 --> 23:41.910
I'm just about there.

23:43.727 --> 23:45.814
- (Beeping)
- Done.

23:45.934 --> 23:47.675
The balloon's deflated.

23:47.990 --> 23:49.929
- Amazing, nice work.
- It's okay?

23:50.206 --> 23:51.069
Is the baby okay?

23:51.076 --> 23:53.214
- Will you check the dilation, Doctor Lin?
- Yeah.

23:53.645 --> 23:55.210
(Beeping)

23:56.138 --> 23:57.670
(Rustling)

24:02.797 --> 24:03.757
4 centimetres.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.410
She'll be fully dilated before we
know it. Let's prepare to deliver.

24:06.530 --> 24:07.356
No.

24:08.142 --> 24:11.227
I don't want you to be the
first one to touch my baby.

24:12.187 --> 24:14.286
(Beeping)

24:14.566 --> 24:15.580
Alright.

24:16.559 --> 24:18.014
Doctor Lin,

24:18.587 --> 24:19.650
you're up.

24:20.621 --> 24:22.044
(Footsteps)

24:23.159 --> 24:24.370
Hello, Barrett.

24:25.528 --> 24:28.741
- Just the woman I wanted to see.
- Oh, I'm flattered.

24:31.027 --> 24:32.502
Will you go to the ceremony

24:32.521 --> 24:35.644
tonight and accept the
award and read my speech?

24:37.724 --> 24:39.606
Isn't that something you should ask Joel?

24:39.628 --> 24:41.400
- Oh, I did.
- Oh.

24:42.861 --> 24:46.821
When the great hero Odysseus
returns from the Trojan war,

24:47.197 --> 24:49.947
he's reunited with his son Telemachus,

24:50.771 --> 24:52.480
who's grown to be as wise,

24:52.600 --> 24:56.084
resourceful and courageous as his father.

24:58.749 --> 25:02.359
I was aiming for a sage but humorous tone.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.509
I can see that's where you were going.

25:04.533 --> 25:07.913
Yeah, it's a great myth about
an archetypal father-son dynamic.

25:11.444 --> 25:13.304
Joel was very upset with me.

25:13.795 --> 25:15.091
You're extremely sick.

25:15.370 --> 25:16.375
He's just worried.

25:16.417 --> 25:18.901
No, I think he's officially done with me.

25:21.033 --> 25:24.007
- We've got to get you up to the OR now, alright?
- Yeah.

25:25.751 --> 25:27.210
(Hospital din)

25:27.961 --> 25:29.342
I want you to have this.

25:29.711 --> 25:31.662
- What is it?
- It's a cheque.

25:31.904 --> 25:35.217
I saw the way Joel looked at you
when you talked about your baby.

25:35.337 --> 25:36.792
I don't want your money.

25:37.186 --> 25:39.251
Gorans don't make good fathers.

25:39.287 --> 25:41.879
Take it from me, he
won't do anything for you.

25:42.237 --> 25:44.011
You might as well have it.

25:47.851 --> 25:48.978
So,

25:50.413 --> 25:51.788
what are my chances?

25:51.908 --> 25:53.472
- This surgery?
- Yeah.

25:53.592 --> 25:54.641
Very hopeful.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.231
Doctor Harris?

26:03.818 --> 26:06.018
My suturing's a little rusty, so...

26:06.054 --> 26:08.325
Want to hand Doctor Dey
the patient's chart, please?

26:08.445 --> 26:09.767
(Beeping)

26:10.857 --> 26:12.843
Now, can you list off to me

26:12.868 --> 26:14.848
all the medications Mrs.
Pratt is currently taking?

26:16.084 --> 26:19.857
- She doesn't seem to be on any medications.
- Exactly.

26:21.165 --> 26:23.170
Is there something I'm missing here?

26:23.230 --> 26:25.120
Check the results of the
tox screen we just did.

26:27.421 --> 26:29.347
- Lithium.
- Causes bones to lose their density,

26:29.372 --> 26:30.777
makes them easier to break.

26:31.158 --> 26:33.024
The grandson's been giving her his lithium.

26:33.054 --> 26:35.416
That would explain her
clumsiness and her falling.

26:35.931 --> 26:37.645
I'm not saying he's been
doing it on purpose, but...

26:37.651 --> 26:39.389
He shouldn't be living with her.

26:40.891 --> 26:41.884
(Sighs)

26:42.381 --> 26:44.138
I'll call Social Services.

26:46.154 --> 26:48.583
- (Beeping)
- (Thud)

26:49.365 --> 26:50.558
(Clicking)

26:51.939 --> 26:53.568
(Crowd din)

26:55.210 --> 26:56.398
Excuse me a moment.

26:57.718 --> 26:58.718
You came.

26:58.838 --> 27:00.014
Joel: You came.

27:00.510 --> 27:04.066
Yes, your father asked me
to read his speech for him.

27:04.690 --> 27:06.107
And how is he doing?

27:07.580 --> 27:08.864
Well, I was able to remove

27:08.888 --> 27:10.615
as much of the dead tissue as I could.

27:11.381 --> 27:13.523
Yeah, it's not the most
glamorous of surgeries.

27:14.798 --> 27:16.266
Thank you for everything.

27:16.586 --> 27:17.598
You'd do the same.

27:18.267 --> 27:20.084
I told him he was potentially going to die

27:20.108 --> 27:20.975
and then I walked out of the room,

27:20.985 --> 27:23.624
so no, that's not quite the same.

27:23.789 --> 27:24.525
Oh.

27:24.932 --> 27:27.383
I kind of feel like running away
and hiding in a ditch someplace.

27:27.403 --> 27:28.610
- Is that weird?
- (Laughs)

27:28.730 --> 27:29.530
(Unclear).

27:29.555 --> 27:31.372
Yeah, I guess we have to take our seats.

27:31.492 --> 27:32.826
My dad gave you an envelope.

27:34.977 --> 27:36.571
- Yes, he did.
- It was money,

27:36.832 --> 27:37.942
wasn't it?

27:38.111 --> 27:39.376
- For the baby.
- Yeah,

27:39.866 --> 27:41.552
it's the Barrett Goran
solution to all problems.

27:41.591 --> 27:44.358
- Well, I'm not going to take it.
- No, I know that, I'm just

27:45.719 --> 27:46.819
disappointed,

27:47.410 --> 27:48.243
I guess.

27:48.786 --> 27:49.944
(Crowd din)

27:50.856 --> 27:51.602
Okay,

27:51.819 --> 27:52.857
speech time.

27:52.934 --> 27:56.022
- Come on, you're terrified of public speaking.
- I'm well aware of that.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.533
I will do it.

27:58.298 --> 27:59.975
Joel, you're not going to like it.

28:00.454 --> 28:01.748
I'll do it anyway.

28:03.236 --> 28:05.071
- Let's go to our table.
- Okay.

28:07.557 --> 28:08.885
(Groaning)

28:09.005 --> 28:11.802
-  Can you feel a foot, either of the feet?
- No.

28:11.976 --> 28:14.064
Neshema, I need you to stop pushing, okay?

28:14.137 --> 28:16.022
Breathe through the contractions.

28:16.051 --> 28:18.043
The baby's breach. I'm
trying to reach her feet.

28:18.067 --> 28:19.856
A baby's heel bone,
it's harder than a hand,

28:19.883 --> 28:21.290
- so go by feel.
- Yeah, I know,

28:21.332 --> 28:22.785
it's just really, really hard to tell.

28:22.975 --> 28:24.134
Baby's in distress.

28:24.467 --> 28:26.587
- I'm trying, this is insane.
- No, this is taking too long.

28:26.614 --> 28:28.618
- Neshema, I have to step in.
- No!

28:28.626 --> 28:32.431
- Neshema, stop this.
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

28:32.699 --> 28:33.434
(Wailing)

28:33.449 --> 28:35.403
- Okay, okay, I have a foot.
- Okay, good.

28:35.433 --> 28:37.442
Oh, God. It's a hand,
Syd, I need your help.

28:38.694 --> 28:39.628
- Neshema...
- No!

28:39.694 --> 28:43.550
I am sorry for how much you lost, but
this baby isn't going to die today, okay?

28:43.670 --> 28:44.996
(Beeping)

28:45.485 --> 28:46.942
Okay, Doctor Lin, move.

28:47.062 --> 28:48.759
(Sobbing)

28:48.934 --> 28:51.108
They sat Shiva for me.

28:52.136 --> 28:55.458
You know what my father said on (Unclear)?

28:55.864 --> 28:58.838
They consider me dead because of you.

28:58.853 --> 28:59.749
I'm sorry.

29:00.159 --> 29:02.598
I was 17, I didn't know how much...

29:02.664 --> 29:04.215
I miss my mother...

29:06.207 --> 29:07.664
More than anything.

29:08.249 --> 29:11.835
When I was scared, my mother
used to sing numi numi.

29:11.904 --> 29:13.769
Did your mother ever sing that to you?

29:14.765 --> 29:17.886
Okay, sing the lullaby with me, Neshema.

29:18.039 --> 29:18.605
Okay.

29:18.841 --> 29:22.159
♪ Numi, numi yaldati ♪

29:36.233 --> 29:39.124
Alright, I'm going to
pull your girl out now.

29:40.491 --> 29:42.363
I want you to push on three.

29:42.394 --> 29:43.488
Ready, Neshema?

29:43.930 --> 29:45.464
- Yes.

So, I'm dead?

31:48.491 --> 31:50.716
Donors have to be dead, right?

31:55.016 --> 31:58.354
So, I'm never going to
see my mom and dad again?

31:59.070 --> 31:59.578
And...

32:00.176 --> 32:02.238
I'm never going to see my friends anymore?

32:02.326 --> 32:03.140
Hey.

32:04.690 --> 32:05.640
I'm your friend.

32:05.675 --> 32:08.050
But I'm never going to do
anything great in my life,

32:08.379 --> 32:09.835
like Derek Jeter.

32:10.630 --> 32:11.647
Buddy,

32:13.178 --> 32:15.912
you already did the most amazing
thing that anybody could do,

32:17.274 --> 32:18.620
way better than Jeter.

32:20.607 --> 32:22.258
Because I gave her my heart?

32:23.499 --> 32:24.347
Yeah.

32:32.608 --> 32:36.117
(Audience applause)

32:37.857 --> 32:39.238
So, obviously...

32:39.480 --> 32:42.237
Thank you. Obviously I'm not Barrett Goran.

32:42.755 --> 32:44.366
Unfortunately, he couldn't be here tonight.

32:44.410 --> 32:45.825
He's quite ill.

32:46.581 --> 32:48.398
And these are his words:

32:49.158 --> 32:51.344
"When the great hero Odysseus

32:52.202 --> 32:54.305
returns from the Trojan wars,

32:54.925 --> 32:57.683
he is reunited with his son Telemachus,

32:57.939 --> 32:59.101
who is... "

32:59.145 --> 33:00.323
(Sighs)

33:03.434 --> 33:06.268
(Crowd murmuring)

33:07.451 --> 33:11.302
I think I must have been about 7 years
old when I asked my father about his work,

33:11.607 --> 33:17.122
and my father's response was
to take me to the hospital, and

33:17.520 --> 33:19.186
I just couldn't believe my eyes.

33:19.220 --> 33:22.505
My father was so attentive and generous

33:22.510 --> 33:25.238
to each and every patient
that he met that night.

33:25.722 --> 33:27.151
He sacrificed...

33:27.796 --> 33:29.463
so much, you know?

33:32.079 --> 33:32.918
He...

33:33.505 --> 33:36.475
he risked almost too much sometimes.

33:40.942 --> 33:44.630
Well, he was a great hero of
mine for a long time, and...

33:45.352 --> 33:47.585
I hope that I can honor that example.

33:47.948 --> 33:49.083
So, he's...

33:51.253 --> 33:53.497
he's told me to tell you
that he's very honored

33:53.546 --> 33:55.082
to receive this award...

33:59.278 --> 34:01.768
And furthermore he would
like to dedicate all

34:02.122 --> 34:04.891
of the award money that
accompanies this prize

34:05.729 --> 34:09.072
to the establishment of a new
street clinic at Hope Zion Hospital.

34:09.193 --> 34:11.607
- (Applause)
- And Doctor Selena Quintos,

34:11.659 --> 34:13.196
founder of the clinic, can't be here today,

34:13.206 --> 34:14.417
but she thanks you as well.

34:14.697 --> 34:18.148
I think this is a testament to
how truly generous my father is.

34:18.313 --> 34:19.529
Thank you so much.

34:19.601 --> 34:21.409
- Bye-bye.
- (Applause)

34:24.722 --> 34:26.621
(Beeping) Charlie: Iris, there's
something we need to discuss.

34:27.567 --> 34:29.321
Is this about my operation?

34:29.858 --> 34:31.835
Charlie: No, this is about your grandson.

34:33.438 --> 34:34.675
Where... where is he?

34:34.795 --> 34:37.693
- Where is my Cameron?
- He was admitted to the psychiatric ward.

34:38.081 --> 34:38.705
No.

34:38.768 --> 34:40.342
Yeah. We believe he was...

34:41.205 --> 34:42.610
giving you his lithium.

34:43.138 --> 34:45.018
- What?!
- Now, is that possible?

34:46.074 --> 34:48.056
Did he give you medication of any kind?

34:48.099 --> 34:49.411
Of course not.

34:53.554 --> 34:55.813
- Oh, my.
- What?

34:55.983 --> 34:58.149
He just got fixated on nutrition.

34:58.546 --> 34:59.254
I...

34:59.893 --> 35:01.293
didn't want to stop him.

35:01.351 --> 35:03.410
He would make me smoothies
every couple of mornings.

35:05.034 --> 35:06.957
He must have put them in there.

35:07.859 --> 35:09.017
He was delusional.

35:11.362 --> 35:13.126
He probably thought he was helping you.

35:13.407 --> 35:15.384
- I want to see him now.
- Charlie: No,

35:15.621 --> 35:18.644
- Iris, you need to focus on your own recovery.
- You don't understand.

35:19.458 --> 35:20.700
His mother

35:20.820 --> 35:22.162
cannot handle him.

35:22.821 --> 35:23.960
He's got no one.

35:24.503 --> 35:26.960
- He's doing so well living with me.
- I'm sure he is.

35:27.003 --> 35:28.452
He needs structure,

35:28.990 --> 35:31.277
and I give him that. He has jobs at home,

35:31.291 --> 35:32.658
he does laundry.

35:33.413 --> 35:34.266
(Sighs)

35:35.732 --> 35:37.225
You can't force him out.

35:37.695 --> 35:38.518
Can you?

35:39.235 --> 35:41.769
No. No, we can't do that.

35:43.635 --> 35:44.413
Alright.

35:45.416 --> 35:46.787
Well, then that's that.

35:47.892 --> 35:50.063
I am not abandoning my boy.

35:53.716 --> 35:56.054
You just let me know when he can come home.

35:59.431 --> 36:02.775
(Hall din)

36:13.775 --> 36:16.058
What would your family do if
you weren't marrying Herschel?

36:20.747 --> 36:22.545
You don't understand, Maggie.

36:23.373 --> 36:24.701
You're out of your depth.

36:32.357 --> 36:33.599
Our kiss...

36:35.280 --> 36:36.443
threw me for a loop.

36:37.994 --> 36:40.799
But I see now that it may have
caused you pain, and I'm sorry.

36:40.843 --> 36:42.975
I'm sorry for harassing
you about Herschel and...

36:42.990 --> 36:45.901
I'm orthodox. I live with a
whole host of expectations.

36:45.926 --> 36:48.150
This isn't about just our kids.

36:48.193 --> 36:50.538
- No, I understand that.
- No, you don't.

36:52.476 --> 36:54.084
Once I'm married,

36:55.542 --> 36:58.277
when my husband wants to have sex with me,

36:58.282 --> 37:00.220
he throws his yarmulke on the bed.

37:02.483 --> 37:03.612
That's dark.

37:06.417 --> 37:08.685
I had a huge crush

37:08.961 --> 37:11.481
on Neshema when we were teenagers.

37:15.163 --> 37:16.636
You saw her. (Chuckles)

37:21.181 --> 37:21.995
(Sobbing)

37:23.148 --> 37:26.934
So, when I caught her kissing a girl,

37:28.765 --> 37:31.944
I ran and I told Neshema's mother.

37:34.942 --> 37:38.741
Not just because Leviticus
condemns homosexuality,

37:38.766 --> 37:40.476
but out of...

37:44.499 --> 37:45.720
(Sobbing)

37:46.907 --> 37:48.801
Do you know what it means...

37:49.790 --> 37:52.804
that her family sat Shiva for her?

37:52.867 --> 37:53.754
(Sniffles)

37:56.118 --> 37:58.493
I as much as killed someone, Maggie.

38:02.070 --> 38:05.073
So, don't you dare think this
has anything to do with you,

38:05.131 --> 38:08.329
okay? This is my life, it's my burden,

38:08.353 --> 38:11.134
and you will never
understand. Do you get that?

38:14.110 --> 38:15.641
Neshema's happy.

38:18.606 --> 38:19.938

(Chuckles) With a slightly
more generous twist.

38:40.574 --> 38:43.094
Well, he probably would've
donated those funds

38:43.108 --> 38:45.347
to stem cell research or
something anyway. I just...

38:45.467 --> 38:47.111
