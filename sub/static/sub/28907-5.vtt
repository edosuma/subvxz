00:04.530 --> 00:06.130
Richard:
It's a beautiful Saturday,

00:06.140 --> 00:08.070
And you wouldn't know
it's winter here in dallas,

00:08.070 --> 00:10.070
And the boys have the day off,
so I told the guys,

00:10.070 --> 00:12.110
"let's drag out the motor
scooters and go for a ride."

00:14.880 --> 00:16.140
[ horn honks ]

00:16.140 --> 00:17.410
[ laughs ]

00:17.410 --> 00:19.880
Hey, fellas, I want to
check something out.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.210
Turning left.

00:21.220 --> 00:22.820
Hey, bass' door is open.

00:22.820 --> 00:25.090
Let's go see what he's doing
on a Saturday.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.020
Yeah, buddy.
It's Saturday, man.

00:31.030 --> 00:32.490
Your doors are open.
What's up?

00:32.500 --> 00:34.090
You know I come here
to get away from you, right?

00:34.100 --> 00:35.900
And then you show up
when I'm here.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.570
Whoo!

00:39.570 --> 00:41.000
Narrator:
Right now on "fast n' loud"...

00:41.000 --> 00:42.170
Boom!
Whoo!

00:42.170 --> 00:43.370
Narrator: ...Hot rod hunter
richard rawlings

00:43.370 --> 00:45.570
And his band of monkeys
are moving and shaking...

00:45.570 --> 00:48.440
Man: I think he has ants
in his pants.

00:48.440 --> 00:52.180
...As they bring the heat
reviving a '33 ford model b...

00:52.180 --> 00:55.180
Mike: You're roasting
marshmallows over here.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.320
...Trying to turn it into
the perfect vintage shop truck.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.920
I was just about ready to put
this thing back together,

00:59.920 --> 01:01.320
And now I can't.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.460
I'm scared it's even
gonna run now.

01:02.460 --> 01:03.590
Narrator: And then...

01:03.590 --> 01:05.190
What's that?
That's my 'cuda.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.260
Richard reels in a '72
plymouth 'cuda...

01:08.260 --> 01:10.600
If you had this car in 1970,
you were a bad dude.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.730
...And goes all in on monster
horsepower for the riviera.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.340
...To see where the monster
power is created.

01:16.340 --> 01:17.800
Jason: Here's your engine
for the riviera.

01:17.810 --> 01:21.210
700.
800 horsepower.

01:21.210 --> 01:22.410
Ha ha!

01:22.410 --> 01:25.980
[ laughing ]

01:25.980 --> 01:27.010
Brian:
Yeah, you know me.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.950
I got a lot of stuff to do,
busy man.

01:28.950 --> 01:30.880
Don't take that off.
I like it better with it on.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.490
It's a lot better look
for you. [bleep]

01:32.490 --> 01:34.150
Dude, I can't believe you do
five days at the monkey

01:34.160 --> 01:36.090
And then come here
and get after it all weekend.

01:36.090 --> 01:37.360
Jason:
Well, look at this place.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.960
You got a lot of stuff
crammed in this shop.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.560
Yeah, I know.
I have so much stuff in here.

01:40.560 --> 01:41.830
God, how many cars
you got in here?

01:41.830 --> 01:43.360
-Like five.
-Is that all?

01:43.370 --> 01:45.100
-Yeah, that's all, just five.
-How do you work in here?

01:45.100 --> 01:46.700
It's all boxed in, man.
Good god.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.440
Well, there's only
just me in here.

01:48.440 --> 01:49.440
It's not, like, a crew.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.770
Richard:
Brian bass and I go way back,

01:50.770 --> 01:52.840
But none of these guys
have seen his shop before.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.980
I've been coming down here
for 13, 14 years.

01:54.980 --> 01:56.640
Bass has got, like,
in the nooks and crannies,

01:56.650 --> 01:58.240
Got some of the coolest
[bleep] you'll ever find

01:58.250 --> 01:59.310
In an auto shop.

01:59.310 --> 02:00.780
If you need it,
it's probably here.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.650
This place is either
a hot rodder's heaven

02:02.650 --> 02:04.050
Or a candidate
for "hoarders."

02:04.050 --> 02:05.520
Charles: Is the stuff close
to the trash

02:05.520 --> 02:06.590
Can gonna go in the trash
can eventually, or...

02:06.590 --> 02:07.650
I'm just curious.

02:07.660 --> 02:08.590
Brian:
It depends on what it is.

02:08.590 --> 02:09.790
Some of that stuff is important.

02:09.790 --> 02:11.720
I do look like a little bit
of a hoarder,

02:11.730 --> 02:13.330
But honestly, everything
in there has a purpose.

02:13.330 --> 02:14.660
It's all hot-rod parts.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.060
This is the latest thing
I've worked on.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.870
-What is that?
-This is a '25 model t roadster

02:17.870 --> 02:20.670
That I've been building
for that beach race,

02:20.670 --> 02:22.000
The race of gentlemen.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.400
So it's got a supercharged
flathead.

02:24.410 --> 02:25.740
-Wow.
-Dang, that's bad.

02:25.740 --> 02:27.440
-That's pretty sweet.
-That is freaking cool.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.940
Richard:
What kind of top speeds
you think you're gonna get?

02:28.940 --> 02:30.210
Brian:
Aw, man, I don't know.

02:30.210 --> 02:31.280
It's probably gonna be
fast enough

02:31.280 --> 02:32.610
That I have to wear a helmet.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.080
-Boom.
-Look at that.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.750
-Ask, and you shall receive.
-Yeah, why won't you?

02:35.750 --> 02:37.620
This is a sweet car.
Did I used to own this?

02:37.620 --> 02:38.950
Brian: I don't think so.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.620
That car came out of
a collection out of east texas.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.090
Sure looks like
what I used to own.

02:42.090 --> 02:43.090
What's up
with the little truck?

02:43.090 --> 02:44.360
This is, what, a '34?

02:44.360 --> 02:45.890
This is a '33 ford pickup.

02:45.890 --> 02:48.160
I actually drug this
out of a barn down in waco

02:48.160 --> 02:49.960
About 2 years ago.
-No kidding.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.700
I bought it for myself
just to build as a shop truck,

02:51.700 --> 02:53.230
But it's been
on the back burner

02:53.240 --> 02:54.700
Like everything else
of my own.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.170
It was an old
service-station truck,

02:56.170 --> 02:57.640
The one with the dinosaur.
-Sinclair.

02:57.640 --> 02:58.840
Yeah, so it
was that color green,

02:58.840 --> 03:00.440
And it just faded
through the years,

03:00.440 --> 03:01.840
And, you know, like,
that patina

03:01.840 --> 03:03.180
Cannot be re-created
very easily,

03:03.180 --> 03:04.580
So I would rather just...

03:04.580 --> 03:06.110
Well, except for mike.
Mike could probably do it.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.510
Well, I was gonna say,
"watch your tongue."

03:07.520 --> 03:08.780
But for me, it would be
tough to re-create.

03:08.780 --> 03:09.980
What do you think?

03:09.990 --> 03:11.180
Would you go flathead
or small-block?

03:11.190 --> 03:12.490
Well, I wanted to put
a flathead in it,

03:12.490 --> 03:13.720
But I don't really have
a good one right now.

03:13.720 --> 03:16.260
Brian: This is a 1934
ford model b pickup,

03:16.260 --> 03:17.720
And that means it has
a four-cylinder in it.

03:17.730 --> 03:18.990
Now, to build a hot rod,

03:18.990 --> 03:20.190
You kind of want to get rid of
that four-cylinder,

03:20.200 --> 03:21.790
So honestly,
if I was gonna do it,

03:21.800 --> 03:24.060
I would pull the 4-cylinder out
and put a flathead v-8 in it.

03:24.070 --> 03:26.730
I think that's the way to go.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.000
Richard: The '33 model b is
a hot rodder's favorite.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.400
They've been built in just about
every way you can imagine,

03:31.410 --> 03:33.140
And for this one,
the biggest bang for the buck

03:33.140 --> 03:34.680
Would be not to overdo it

03:34.680 --> 03:37.880
And make it into just
a super cool shop truck,

03:37.880 --> 03:39.810
Which means we'd use it
at the garage to look good

03:39.820 --> 03:41.480
When we're picking up parts
and running errands,

03:41.480 --> 03:43.420
And at the same time,
it'd still be a kick-ass,

03:43.420 --> 03:45.020
Original gas monkey hot rod.

03:45.020 --> 03:46.150
And if you happen to own
a business

03:46.150 --> 03:47.890
And in need of a shop truck,
well,

03:47.890 --> 03:49.620
I'd even be willing to part
with it for the right price.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.760
I just don't have time to work
on this thing, man.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.700
I would love to do a dropped
axle, hydraulic brakes,

03:54.700 --> 03:56.030
Leave the patina as is,
you know,

03:56.030 --> 03:57.830
And just build
a nice chassis,

03:57.830 --> 03:59.230
So I could drive it, you know,
as a shop truck, but...

03:59.230 --> 04:00.500
Probably put a windshield
in it, right?

04:00.500 --> 04:02.640
Yeah, well...

04:02.640 --> 04:04.700
This thing is pretty sweet,
and you know I like green.

04:04.710 --> 04:05.970
-Yeah.
-Uh-oh.

04:05.970 --> 04:07.570
I've known richard
for a long time,

04:07.580 --> 04:09.310
And I can tell when he's really
getting jazzed about something.

04:09.310 --> 04:10.840
Look at this
air conditioning.

04:10.850 --> 04:11.910
Wsheww!

04:11.910 --> 04:13.180
It's getting
cooler already.

04:13.180 --> 04:14.850
I can see the twinkle
in his eye.

04:14.850 --> 04:16.350
He was into this truck.

04:16.350 --> 04:17.580
You ought
to sell me this.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.250
Dude, I really bought
this thing for myself.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.520
I wasn't really planning
on selling it.

04:20.520 --> 04:22.360
Well, you said you wanted
to build it, so...

04:22.360 --> 04:23.790
Yeah, I do want to build it,
but, you know,

04:23.790 --> 04:26.130
Obviously it's, like,
last on my list right now.

04:26.130 --> 04:27.260
That's what I mean.
Look around.

04:27.260 --> 04:28.600
Yeah.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.930
So if you sell it to me,
you get to build it.

04:29.930 --> 04:31.330
Dude, I dig it.
What's the number?

04:31.330 --> 04:33.270
That's not something you
just go find everywhere.

04:33.270 --> 04:34.430
It took me a while
to find this truck,

04:34.440 --> 04:35.540
So it's not going
to be cheap.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.200
Well, here's
the tricky trick.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.940
I've got an h&h flathead,
all built, in the box.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.410
Well, that'd bolt
right in there, just about.

04:41.410 --> 04:42.340
Mm-hmm.

04:42.340 --> 04:43.410
Pop that strap, bud.

04:43.410 --> 04:44.950
Richard:
Y'all remember a while back,

04:44.950 --> 04:46.610
I did some late-night shopping

04:46.620 --> 04:48.750
And accidentally, on purpose,
ended up with a flathead motor.

04:48.750 --> 04:52.220
Man, I know I had a couple beers
last night, but no way.

04:52.220 --> 04:54.090
Check that baby out.

04:54.090 --> 04:55.290
How much do you want
for this stuff?

04:55.290 --> 04:56.760
$8,500.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.030
You said I'll have 8,500 cash
when you get here.

04:58.030 --> 04:59.690
Tony: I probably would have got
it for less than that

04:59.700 --> 05:01.430
If I was handling the deal
on the internet, but...

05:01.430 --> 05:02.760
Shut up, tony.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.030
Richard: I always knew it was
just a matter of time

05:04.030 --> 05:05.500
Before I'd have
a good use for it.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.300
Well, if I make the right
deal with brian,

05:07.300 --> 05:08.370
That time could be now.

05:08.370 --> 05:11.770
I'm thinking $15,000.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.710
$15,000?

05:13.710 --> 05:15.180
Bass hit me at $15,000,

05:15.180 --> 05:17.440
And I knew that I was not gonna
get him to move an inch.

05:17.450 --> 05:20.110
I kind of feel like he might be
charging me 1,000 per year

05:20.120 --> 05:21.920
Of knowing me
and putting up with me.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.580
Maybe that's where he came up
with the number.

05:23.590 --> 05:24.990
I know I'm not gonna
get you off $15,000.

05:24.990 --> 05:26.120
No.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.120
I don't have to sell it,

05:27.120 --> 05:28.220
And it's a seller's
market right now.

05:31.930 --> 05:32.860
All right.
[bleep] it.

05:32.860 --> 05:34.190
Let's do it.
-Hey.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.460
God, that was the easiest
negotiation I've ever seen.

05:36.460 --> 05:37.660
Hell yeah.

05:37.670 --> 05:38.800
Plus it's, like,
the first thing

05:38.800 --> 05:39.800
I've ever bought out
of this shop.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.070
If I'm gonna sell this truck,

05:41.070 --> 05:42.340
I'd much rather sell it
to richard

05:42.340 --> 05:43.740
And get to be on board
building it than anything else.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.010
I mean, that's really
the ideal situation --

05:45.010 --> 05:46.540
Sell it to him,
collect that money

05:46.540 --> 05:48.170
And then collect more money
for building it?

05:48.180 --> 05:49.680
Dude, that's a no-brainer.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.210
What do we got to do?
Do we got to pull
it off the frame?

05:51.210 --> 05:52.680
-I can tell you what I would do.
-Okay.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.750
I would pull it all apart,
get it down to a bare frame,

05:54.750 --> 05:57.420
Do a dropped axle in the front,
do a stock rear end

05:57.420 --> 06:00.020
But with different gears,
do a newer transmission

06:00.020 --> 06:01.420
And then do a really
nice interior,

06:01.420 --> 06:03.360
Paint the firewall
and put your flathead in it.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.360
Are we painting the chassis,
too, while we got it out?

06:05.360 --> 06:06.830
I would paint
the chassis.

06:06.830 --> 06:08.760
I would just pick a green
in this general area here

06:08.760 --> 06:11.300
And paint
the chassis that color.

06:11.300 --> 06:13.030
Richard: Here's the plan --
we'll take this ford model b

06:13.040 --> 06:14.900
And make it into
a vintage-looking shop truck,

06:14.900 --> 06:17.100
Ready to run parts
or just looking cool.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.510
We'll keep the 85 years
of patina,

06:18.510 --> 06:20.310
But upgrade just about
everything else.

06:20.310 --> 06:23.040
Put a modern suspension
under it, redo the interior,

06:23.050 --> 06:24.640
Give it some power
with a flathead v-8

06:24.650 --> 06:25.980
That I've already paid for,

06:25.980 --> 06:27.980
And I'll give them
a budget of $5,000

06:27.980 --> 06:29.850
And 2 weeks
to go through it and bam!

06:29.850 --> 06:31.850
This could be the perfect
shop-truck build.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.350
I'm gonna call mater
and have him come get it,

06:33.360 --> 06:34.920
So you got a lot of [bleep]
to move to get it out of here.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.390
That's not part
of the deal.

06:36.390 --> 06:37.720
I think these guys need to
stick around and help me.

06:37.730 --> 06:38.990
-Oh, no, no.
-We're on motorcycles, man.

06:38.990 --> 06:40.260
-It's Saturday.
-Peace out on that.

for that.

06:44.930 --> 06:46.800
Mike: That is a cool truck.
It is.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.740
It's just the whole idea
of making him be a part

06:48.740 --> 06:51.270
Of the build of something that
he really wanted for himself,

06:51.270 --> 06:53.010
But I get to keep it
and sell it.

Man, that's messed up.

-Yeah, it is messed up.
-It is kind of fun.

To get our mitts
on a custom frame

I'm the director of aftermarket
operations for katech.

08:31.370 --> 08:33.370
We did the engines
for the shiner beer truck

08:33.380 --> 08:35.380
And a crew-cut truck,
and we were very excited

08:35.380 --> 08:37.510
When richard said he needed
an lt engine

08:37.510 --> 08:40.150
For the new riviera project.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.850
Richard: Katech is famous
for building engines

08:41.850 --> 08:43.320
For the gm corvette team

08:43.320 --> 08:45.720
That dominated racing circuits
for decades.

to make a motor

When it comes to motorsports
technology, katech is it.

08:51.790 --> 08:53.590
Jason: This is our
full-service car shop,

08:53.600 --> 08:56.200
So this is a shop
full of customers' cars.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.130
They bought a new corvette,

08:57.130 --> 08:58.270
New camaro,
something like that,

08:58.270 --> 08:59.600
And they want
to give it more power

08:59.600 --> 09:01.200
And set it apart
from the rest of them.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.600
They send it to katech.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.940
So you'll yank it
and do all the work

09:03.940 --> 09:04.940
And put it back in
and send it back to them?

09:04.940 --> 09:06.340

in-house here.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.480
This one is what I like
right here.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.280
This is very similar
to the whole concept

09:11.280 --> 09:14.750
I came up with the '72 riviera
because the riviera was built

09:14.750 --> 09:16.750
As a gentleman's hot rod,
so it had power.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.890
It had torque, but it wasn't
in a small package.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.150
It was a big package.

09:20.150 --> 09:21.960
Josh: Seeing the motor
in a corvette z06 is awesome.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.620
It does resemble
a corvette actually.

09:23.630 --> 09:26.360
It looks very similar to it
with the sloping back lines,

09:26.360 --> 09:27.830
With the narrowing in the back.
-Yeah, the vents.

09:27.830 --> 09:29.230

and the brakes.

Seeing what richard's vision
was is awesome

I didn't see it

work out well.

Brian:
Playing by richard's rules,

14:04.040 --> 14:05.640
Trying to get this truck done
as fast as possible,

14:05.640 --> 14:07.510
That's, for sure, gonna be
a challenge for me.

14:07.510 --> 14:09.580
All right.
Waiting for the release.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.640
Oh, there it is.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.510
But it's his truck now, and he's
paying me to apply my vision.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.180
Well, that's a sweet deal
for me.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.650
Can richard make
some money on it?

14:18.650 --> 14:20.450
Well, that's up to him.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.260
Bye, frame.

14:22.260 --> 14:23.920
See you tomorrow.

14:23.930 --> 14:32.530
♪

14:32.530 --> 14:41.210
♪

14:41.210 --> 14:42.680
Jason: We'll let you guys
do your thing first,

14:42.680 --> 14:44.480
And then I'll do
the mechanic work after that.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.810
It's either got some really
bad gas in it

14:45.810 --> 14:47.150
Or a couple of dead plugs.

14:47.150 --> 14:48.610
Mike:
Tony's got bad gas.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.620
Tony:
That was yesterday.

14:50.620 --> 14:52.750
So this is what's super cool.
My 'cuda just got here.

14:52.750 --> 14:55.820
These guys haven't seen it yet,
but super rad, sublime green,

14:55.820 --> 14:57.290
But it's got all the new bells
and whistles,

14:57.290 --> 14:58.890
You know, modern motor,
modern trans,

14:58.890 --> 15:01.690
Four-wheel brakes,
coilover suspension,

15:01.700 --> 15:04.960
Beautiful paint and body, and I
stole it for only 45 grand.

15:04.970 --> 15:07.030
What do y'all think of that?

15:07.040 --> 15:09.040
-What part of that?
-It's pretty decent.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.440
What do you mean, man?

15:10.440 --> 15:12.840
It's also got a 5-speed in it
instead of a 4-speed.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.310
-Yeah, no, that's...
-Yeah, that's cool.

15:14.310 --> 15:16.310
I stole this car
for only 45 grand.

15:16.310 --> 15:19.250
Hey, I feel better about what
we know than if he stole it.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.850
Wait.
I don't know what they think

15:20.850 --> 15:22.510
They know,
but here's what I know,

15:22.520 --> 15:25.450
That you at home need to know
about how I got this '70 'cuda.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.790
I was in florida
checking out a shop

15:29.790 --> 15:32.060
I invested in for my show,
"garage rehab."

15:32.060 --> 15:33.460
You've probably seen it.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.330
Anyways, I was taking care of
business with chris and russell.

15:35.330 --> 15:37.400
Because then they have
the audio work that they do.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.270
They have all the air
suspension they do,

15:39.270 --> 15:40.930
So each one can have
a designated area

15:40.940 --> 15:42.800
With the specialty equipment
as needed.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.600
What's that?
Is it yours?

15:44.610 --> 15:45.740
No, it ain't mine.

15:45.740 --> 15:46.940
Looks like something
you'd own.

15:46.940 --> 15:48.340
Looks like
something you did.

15:48.340 --> 15:50.610
-Yo!
-Yes, sir?

15:50.610 --> 15:52.080
Where the [bleep]
is mark dicks?

15:52.080 --> 15:53.880
Apparently, this guy had left
his motorcycle

15:53.880 --> 15:55.210
At the shop to be repaired.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.120
After I calmed him down,
I wanted to find out

15:57.120 --> 15:58.420
About something
that caught my eye.

15:58.420 --> 16:00.020
What's that?
That's my 'cuda.

16:00.020 --> 16:02.490
Hey, y'all get to work.

16:02.490 --> 16:05.160
Now, I love barracudas,
especially if they're green.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.360
These cars are hot right now,
and those crazy mopar collectors

16:07.360 --> 16:09.960
Have laid out tons of cash
for these limited-run beauties.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.500
-All the way around, right?
-That's cool.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.500
It's got a three-length drag
rear end, limited slip.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.700
It's got a tremec 5-speed,
air conditioning.

16:15.700 --> 16:16.970
That's pretty rad actually.

16:16.970 --> 16:19.240
Not numbers-matching,
but a lot of modern upgrades,

16:19.240 --> 16:20.710
And that spelled profit
if I could get it

16:20.710 --> 16:23.110
For the right price,
so I took it for a ride.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.780
Whoa!

16:28.780 --> 16:30.620
Yeah, it's a little binding up
on the tranny, too.

16:30.620 --> 16:32.920
Okay, it had some minor
mechanical issues,

16:32.920 --> 16:34.520
But nothing my guys can't fix,

16:34.520 --> 16:35.990
But it had pristine
paint and body,

16:35.990 --> 16:39.860
Which is the expensive part,
so I made him an offer.

16:39.860 --> 16:41.130
I'd do $45,000.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.700
You got cash money?
I always have cash money.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.930
Let's go get you
some cash,

16:46.940 --> 16:47.930
As long as russell
didn't spend it all.

16:47.940 --> 16:50.740
Come on in.

16:50.740 --> 16:53.270
So I stole this gorgeous
'70 'cuda for 45 grand,

16:53.270 --> 16:56.880
But for some reason,
the monkeys are whining already.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.340
What are you trying to say?

16:58.350 --> 17:01.080
It's got a problem.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.880
You've got to be
[bleep] kidding me.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.220
Your transport driver.

17:04.220 --> 17:06.020
Somehow when I had this car
shipped to texas,

17:06.020 --> 17:07.350
It got crunched.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.550
It's one of the reasons
I bought the car

17:08.560 --> 17:10.220
Is paint
and body is so expensive.

17:10.220 --> 17:13.160
Now it's gonna cost me to fix
it, which means less profit.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.360
All right.
Well, that's great.

17:14.360 --> 17:16.560
I bought a car
that was mechanically eh

17:16.560 --> 17:18.960
Because it was perfect interior
and paint and body,

17:18.970 --> 17:20.500
So let's get it into paint
and body first

17:20.500 --> 17:22.840
Because we're busy over there
and then get it over to you.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.170
Okay. And just start
at the very front.

17:24.170 --> 17:25.840
Go all the way to the back,
every single thing,

17:25.840 --> 17:27.110
Just check it.

17:27.110 --> 17:28.370
You know what they say?
-What's that?

17:28.380 --> 17:30.510
"no really good deal
goes unpunished."

17:30.510 --> 17:31.840
I think it's good deed.

17:31.850 --> 17:33.050
Good [bleep] deal.

17:33.050 --> 17:35.380
It's good deed.

17:35.380 --> 17:37.420
That thing
does sound bad.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.460
Jason: You know
what's funny about this

17:42.460 --> 17:45.320
Is richard always wants
to build a shop truck,

17:45.330 --> 17:47.390
But we've built, like,
three shop trucks,

17:47.400 --> 17:48.930
And if you notice,
none of them are still here.

17:48.930 --> 17:50.130
-Yeah, I'm looking...
-Because he sells them

17:50.130 --> 17:51.260
Before we can even get
a chance to use them.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.660
You guys are saying that.

17:52.670 --> 17:53.530
I'm looking around,
"where is the shop truck?"

17:53.530 --> 17:54.730
Yeah, exactly.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.170
Brian: It's only day 2
of the '33 model b build,

17:56.170 --> 17:57.270
But we're well under way.

17:57.270 --> 17:58.400
We got the truck
blown apart yesterday,

17:58.410 --> 17:59.740
And while the frame
is at the sandblaster,

17:59.740 --> 18:01.270
I'm going to get together
with jeremy

18:01.280 --> 18:02.610
To figure out what to do
about the piece of fender

18:02.610 --> 18:05.540
Missing from the right rear.

18:05.550 --> 18:07.480
That fender will be the best
place to start, in my opinion,

18:07.480 --> 18:09.010
Because
it's the worst one.

18:09.020 --> 18:11.150
Is this is a "stick it back
together as close as it can be

18:11.150 --> 18:12.820
And put a big old fat
mig-weld on it?"

18:12.820 --> 18:13.950
-No.
-No.

18:13.960 --> 18:14.950
I think we should do it...

18:14.960 --> 18:16.560
Treat it like we're doing
anything else

18:16.560 --> 18:17.690
In case
somewhere down the line,

18:17.690 --> 18:18.690
Someone wants
to make this thing

18:18.690 --> 18:20.830
Into a nicely painted,
finished truck.

18:20.830 --> 18:22.090
Yeah.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.230
Then at least give them
a head start.

18:23.230 --> 18:24.860
With only 2 weeks to finish
the build,

18:24.870 --> 18:26.300
It's all too easy to do things
the quick and dirty way,

18:26.300 --> 18:27.830
But that's not my style.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.440
I've never done that working
by myself,

18:29.440 --> 18:31.900
And I'm not going to let the gas
monkey's schedule change that.

18:31.910 --> 18:34.040
I mean, we're not gonna go
crazy with the metalwork,

18:34.040 --> 18:36.040
But there are a few things
we need to fix just for...

18:36.040 --> 18:37.580
You know, to make it usable.

18:37.580 --> 18:40.510
Anything we're doing needs
to be done right.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.180
Even though this is a crusty,
old, beat-up truck,

18:43.180 --> 18:44.320
I don't want people
to look at it and say,

18:44.320 --> 18:46.650
"oh, they did
terrible work."

18:46.650 --> 18:48.120
Richard, he seems to think
it's fast and easy

18:48.120 --> 18:50.120
Just to graft a piece
onto the existing fender.

18:50.120 --> 18:51.920
Now, I picked up a repop
when it was still my project,

18:51.930 --> 18:53.790
But there's still the question
of matching the patina.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.460
Let me go get mike and see
what he thinks about this.

18:55.460 --> 18:56.730
Jeremy: All right.
Well, shoot.

18:56.730 --> 18:57.800
Making the right decision
is gonna have

18:57.800 --> 18:59.130
To include
the paint department.

18:59.130 --> 19:01.000
All right.
I found the new fender.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
You brought mike
with you.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.410
Our question for you,
mike, is,

19:06.410 --> 19:09.840
What is faster and better
for this particular job?

19:09.840 --> 19:11.410
Richard talked about
grafting the fender

19:11.410 --> 19:13.950
And keeping the patina,
but honestly,

19:13.950 --> 19:15.680
I think if you can match
this patina

19:15.680 --> 19:17.250
To make it look
like the other fender

19:17.250 --> 19:19.550
And kind of what's left here,
that would be way faster.

19:19.550 --> 19:22.560
If you want me to do a patina
match on that, I can do that.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.820
Let's do the whole fender.

19:23.820 --> 19:25.220
I'll have to find
all of those colors.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.630
Yeah.
There's about 50 colors

19:26.630 --> 19:28.290
In, like,
1 square-inch here, so...

19:28.300 --> 19:29.830
I think going with a whole
new fender is the right call.

19:29.830 --> 19:31.500
This way I can have jeremy
move on to other work

19:31.500 --> 19:34.570
While mike matches the patina.

19:34.570 --> 19:35.700
I got this for you.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.970
All right.

19:37.970 --> 19:39.710
Mike:
Well, do me a favor.

19:39.710 --> 19:41.840
Take that fender off,
and let me have that fender.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.580
Deal.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.310
Narrator:
Coming up on "fast n' loud"...

19:46.310 --> 19:47.650
There is
a serious vibration.

19:47.650 --> 19:49.250
...It's a 'cuda calamity...

19:49.250 --> 19:50.450
Damn, this thing
sounds horrible.

19:50.450 --> 19:51.980
Oh, yeah.

19:51.990 --> 19:55.920
...As the monkeys take their
frustration out on the '33 ford.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.990
I don't remember telling you
it was okay to tear it up.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.030
Yes, you did.

20:10.340 --> 20:12.270
-Here's the tailgate.
-So jump on it?

20:12.270 --> 20:13.610
Brian: That's how
I would do it.

20:13.610 --> 20:17.280
So do it more like a...

20:17.280 --> 20:18.480
Not like that.
Not like...

20:18.480 --> 20:19.880
More like a skateboard?

20:19.880 --> 20:21.250
No, no.
Don't drop in.

20:21.250 --> 20:22.480
Straight off the...
Don't drop in on it?

20:22.480 --> 20:23.680
Don't drop in on it.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.680
Brian: The tailgate
on the '33 ford

20:24.690 --> 20:26.090
Has definitely
taken some licks,

20:26.090 --> 20:27.350
So old tony hawk here
is gonna straighten it out

20:27.350 --> 20:29.490
The old-fashioned way.

20:29.490 --> 20:31.090
Gently, too.
Gently jump?

20:31.090 --> 20:32.490
Gently jump on it.

20:32.490 --> 20:33.890
Gently place
my heavy ass on it?

20:33.900 --> 20:36.160
Gently place
your heavy ass on it.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.630
When you're
straightening out metal

20:37.630 --> 20:39.360
On an 85-year-old truck,
sometimes your own two feet work

20:39.370 --> 20:41.500
As good as $10,000
worth of heavy machinery.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.640
See, it's like
a trampoline of steel.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.240
It's actually working,
so you see that, richard?

20:46.240 --> 20:48.510
A little down-home ingenuity
can save you some bucks.

20:48.510 --> 20:50.440
I think you actually are
fixing it right now.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.980
All right.

20:51.980 --> 20:53.250
Jeremy still needs to weld up
a couple of rough spots

20:53.250 --> 20:54.780
On the tailgate before
handing it off to mike.

20:54.780 --> 20:56.380
In the meantime,
I'm doing a once-over

20:56.380 --> 20:58.580
On the '39 transmission
I've been saving for this truck.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.250
Ugh, that's pretty gross.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.860
You want some of this?
It's like the...

21:02.860 --> 21:04.320
You know, when your mom
would bake you a cake,

21:04.330 --> 21:07.330
And she'd let you
lick the spatula.

21:07.330 --> 21:09.860
Whoa!
Slinging some goo your way.

21:09.860 --> 21:11.330
Sorry.

21:11.330 --> 21:13.000
It kind of looks like
it's a piece of junk right now,

21:13.000 --> 21:14.130
But it's really not.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.600
Just have to clean up
the outside,

21:15.600 --> 21:17.540
Make sure everything inside
is as good as I think it is

21:17.540 --> 21:20.070
And rebuild it later before
bolting it into the truck.

21:20.070 --> 21:21.410
Hopefully someone hid,

21:21.410 --> 21:23.140
Like, thousands
of dollars inside here.

21:23.140 --> 21:25.210
Ugh, no.

21:25.210 --> 21:26.750
See, it looks
pretty nice inside.

21:26.750 --> 21:29.210
It's really clean.
I think that's gonna work.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.480
Look.
"'39 ford."

21:31.490 --> 21:33.550
It's kind of, like, the original
hot-rod transmission.

21:33.550 --> 21:35.090
Everybody that had a flathead
in their hot rod,

21:35.090 --> 21:37.890
They wanted this transmission
because it had a floor shift

21:37.890 --> 21:39.160
And can hold up to
a little more horsepower.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.830
It's a little guy.

21:40.830 --> 21:42.030
It's just a little fella.

21:42.030 --> 21:43.500
This transmission
is in good shape,

21:43.500 --> 21:44.830
So I'll send it over to mike
to paint it along

21:44.830 --> 21:46.430
With the interior of the cab.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.830
Hey.
Vroom, vroom.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.100
Tony: This thing doesn't
steer very well.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.570
Vroom, vroom.

21:50.570 --> 21:51.900
I'm trying to get it started,
but it won't run.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.510
It seems to be running
just fine.

Jason: Yeah, exactly
for how bad it was.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.990

22:12.930 --> 22:13.860
A day's worth of work.

22:13.860 --> 22:15.330
Yeah, it looks great.
Perfect.

22:15.330 --> 22:20.000
Coy and tony did a fantastic job
on the paint and body repair,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.540
But the bigger problem
is how this thing drives.

22:22.540 --> 22:25.070
Yeah, it's a little binding
up on the tranny.

22:25.070 --> 22:28.010
Okay, so when I bought
this car...

22:28.010 --> 22:29.340
It doesn't shift super well.
-Yep.

22:29.340 --> 22:31.340
It's got a weird noise
in the rear end,

22:31.350 --> 22:34.610
And it obviously needs tires,
so we need to give it

22:34.620 --> 22:36.450
A good one-through
from the front to the back.

22:36.450 --> 22:38.420
So mopars are always hot,
and a '70 'cuda

22:38.420 --> 22:39.750
Has always been a popular car,

22:39.750 --> 22:41.550
And people will shell out
top dollar for them,

22:41.560 --> 22:43.360
Especially one
in this condition,

22:43.360 --> 22:45.220
So I'm gonna list it
for sale on the old interwebs.

22:45.230 --> 22:47.160
-Go for a ride?
-Yeah, let's do it.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.430
I'm counting on you, jason.

22:48.430 --> 22:49.630
Let's do it.

22:49.630 --> 22:53.100
Tony:
Uh, what's happening?

22:53.100 --> 22:55.600
Yeah.
Wow, a lot of wobbling.

22:57.370 --> 22:58.840
Golly, man.

22:58.840 --> 23:01.110
Feel the...
Hear the knock on those tires?

23:01.110 --> 23:03.310
-What is that?
-We may not get very far.

23:03.310 --> 23:04.580
Is that the driveshaft?

23:04.580 --> 23:07.510
Dude, I don't know.
There is a serious vibration.

23:07.510 --> 23:09.380
Oh, god.

23:09.380 --> 23:10.920
Definitely
an issue there.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.720
Try to keep it on the pedal
as most I can.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.390
Oof.

23:15.390 --> 23:20.390
♪

23:20.390 --> 23:21.860
After the test-drive,
tony and I were left

23:21.860 --> 23:23.730
With more questions
than answers.

23:23.730 --> 23:25.200
We're not real sure what's
going on with the rear end,

23:25.200 --> 23:26.800
But we've got a lot
of noise happening,

23:26.800 --> 23:28.870
And what's more concerning
is that underneath the car,

23:28.870 --> 23:31.200
Nothing loose, nothing
broken that we can see.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.810
It's internally inside the hub,

23:32.810 --> 23:34.670
So we're gonna take
a look in there.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.810
-She is pretty.
-She's brand-new.

23:36.810 --> 23:39.150
It's got to be in the preload
of this thing,

or something.

23:41.010 --> 23:42.480

the differential apart,

We don't see anything
worn or torn up.

23:44.220 --> 23:45.820
In fact, it all looks brand-new.

23:45.820 --> 23:47.350
This is getting weird.

23:47.350 --> 23:49.490
The only thing I can think
is those gears are slopping.

23:49.490 --> 23:50.620
They're missing a tooth
or skipping

23:50.630 --> 23:51.960
Or just hitting them
really hard.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.490
It's really frustrating.

23:53.490 --> 23:55.760
Even with our combined years
of experience, we get stumped.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.160
The driveshaft
is rubbing.

23:57.170 --> 23:58.300
Well, that would explain
why it sounds like

23:58.300 --> 23:59.430
It's hitting the floor.

23:59.430 --> 24:01.430
Yeah, you can see
the rub mark there.

It holds the driveshaft.
Stupid hoop.

24:11.180 --> 24:12.710
...Take it for another
test drive,

24:12.710 --> 24:14.980

should be solved.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.680

sounds horrible.

-Almost like the rear end

'cuda done, but I'm stumped.

If jeremy has any ideas,
I'm all ears.

24:42.280 --> 24:45.880
Check out this.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.210
Oh.

24:47.210 --> 24:48.410
It looks fine, like,
if you don't know.

24:48.420 --> 24:49.550

to look there.

24:49.550 --> 24:51.950
-But look at the other side.
-Yeah.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.420
These brackets
are always straight.

24:53.420 --> 24:55.090
They're never like that.
-Over half an inch?

24:55.090 --> 24:56.420
Oh, it's over pretty good.

24:56.420 --> 24:58.090
Right away, whenever I look back
at the read end,

24:58.090 --> 24:59.890
I can see that one
of the 4-link tabs

24:59.890 --> 25:01.630
Is completely bent.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.500
So apparently at some point,
it's been overloaded,

25:03.500 --> 25:06.570
And that probably explains
why the driveshaft was rubbing.

25:06.570 --> 25:07.900
So under pressure,
it's torquing.

25:07.900 --> 25:09.500
Yeah, so that's
the track bar.

25:09.500 --> 25:10.840
That's what keeps the read
end under the car straight.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.300
Mm-hmm.

25:12.310 --> 25:14.770
And with that being bent,
the rear end is that way.

25:14.780 --> 25:15.910
Which way did you say
it was rubbing?

25:15.910 --> 25:17.040
-Yep.
-It was rubbing driver side?

25:17.040 --> 25:18.310
Yeah, mm-hmm, yeah.

25:18.310 --> 25:20.110
Well, everything should be
pushed that way

25:20.110 --> 25:21.650
By the bend
being this way.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.180
We'll just have to
pull all this down.

25:23.180 --> 25:24.250
Yeah.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.380
We'll straighten
these two tabs up

25:25.390 --> 25:26.590
And get them nice
and straight

25:26.590 --> 25:27.450
And then run a gusset
down the front of it.

25:27.450 --> 25:28.990
Just box them in.

25:28.990 --> 25:30.590
Richard told jason he needs
the car back really quick,

That will be the fun part,
clean it up, weld in a gusset,

Mike, we got

Brian made the call

to town welding on it.

The challenge is matching
the same layers of paint

That have been on the truck
for more than 80 years.

26:22.510 --> 26:25.640
Dark green because
that's obviously the base one.

26:25.650 --> 26:28.650
Then somebody repainted it

The black electrocoat
off the new fender.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.320

26:36.320 --> 26:38.120
But it will be more
authentic without it.

26:38.130 --> 26:42.530
Anyway, a little rust will work
in my favor down the road.

26:42.530 --> 26:44.860
Most jobs need a lot of
tender love and care.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.470

The hardest part is probably

The trick is how they get
layered on the fender.

27:03.020 --> 27:05.550
Feel free to try
this one at home, kids.

27:05.550 --> 27:06.790
In between base coats,

I'm dabbing
on some buffing compound.

27:08.490 --> 27:11.260
Wherever I smear that stuff on,
the paint won't stick.

27:14.100 --> 27:17.100
I want the texture
that that's got,

27:17.100 --> 27:19.370
So once I'm done shooting
my base coats,

27:19.370 --> 27:21.500
I'll just wipe all this off,

27:21.500 --> 27:23.770
And there will be different
layers of paint.

27:23.770 --> 27:25.440
Or at least that's the plan.

To do and blow their lead
on this truck, so zip it.

29:06.810 --> 29:08.340
What color we painting
the frame?

29:08.340 --> 29:11.340
Same as the body, that kind of
of faded-green-looking color.

-We're gonna fix that.
-Yeah, we're gonna weld it up,

And we're going
to matte clear it.

What's that hole for?

and it starts the truck up.

This is tricky

Because if we put
too much into this build

29:32.900 --> 29:34.770

the cost goes up,

that might want it goes down,

29:36.840 --> 29:38.770

with that.

37:20.830 --> 37:21.900
We're still making a hot rod.

37:21.900 --> 37:23.430
If it has the gas monkey
name on it,

37:23.440 --> 37:24.970
You can bet it's going
to be a hot rod.

37:24.970 --> 37:26.900
We have to pull the old bearings
off of all the parts here

37:26.910 --> 37:28.440
And put the new bearings on,

37:28.440 --> 37:30.110
And then I'll actually start
putting it in the case.

37:30.110 --> 37:31.440
We'll have a transmission.

37:31.450 --> 37:32.780
I've been holding
onto this '39 3-speed

37:32.780 --> 37:34.110
Just for this project,
so when richard

37:34.110 --> 37:36.110
Bought the truck,
I made that part of the deal.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.080
Does this turn you on?

37:38.080 --> 37:39.980
No one makes replacement parts
for these old transmissions,

37:39.990 --> 37:43.790
So I've had to clean up
all the original parts.

37:43.790 --> 37:45.060
When I broke the transmission
down,

37:45.060 --> 37:46.990
I took some pictures
with my phone.

37:46.990 --> 37:48.130
I'm using those to make sure

37:48.130 --> 37:49.460
I get it put back together
just right.

37:49.460 --> 37:51.460
So that goes like that.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.930
Mike:
What are you doing?

37:53.930 --> 37:57.340
Trying to put the transmission
back together.

37:57.340 --> 37:58.740
Trying to put the transmission
back together...

37:58.740 --> 37:59.870
Yeah, trying.

37:59.870 --> 38:01.340
...Or putting the transmission
back together?

38:01.340 --> 38:02.470
-Well, a little of both.
-You know how it is?

38:02.480 --> 38:04.880
I think so.
I'm gonna find out.

38:04.880 --> 38:07.610
-Is that supposed to be that...
-Oh, wait.

38:07.610 --> 38:09.050
There is a tube missing
right there, though.

38:09.050 --> 38:10.680
Yeah, there's a whole tube
missing.

38:10.680 --> 38:13.280
Yeah, I didn't even notice that.
I totally missed that.

38:13.290 --> 38:16.020
Okay, well, I got to go find
another cluster gear now.

38:16.020 --> 38:17.360
Where we gonna
find that at?

38:17.360 --> 38:18.760
You got one at your shop?
I bet you do.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.020
I probably do, yeah.

38:20.030 --> 38:22.030
Your pile of junk.

38:22.030 --> 38:25.030
See, my pile of junk
comes in handy, though.

38:25.030 --> 38:27.770
I'm no mechanic, but you would
think that something

38:27.770 --> 38:29.300
That's missing
a giant chunk out of it

38:29.300 --> 38:30.840
Would not be good
to put back together.

38:30.840 --> 38:32.100
It's probably been
kind of noisy,

38:32.110 --> 38:33.170
Missing a tooth.

38:33.170 --> 38:34.240
-Noisy?
-Yeah.

38:34.240 --> 38:35.910
If it even worked.
It would work.

38:35.910 --> 38:37.440
It would just make
a lot of noise.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.840
I'm scared it's even
gonna run now.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.310
Geez, louise.

38:40.310 --> 38:41.850
Brian: Well, that's gonna
slow me down a little bit.

38:41.850 --> 38:43.450
I was just about ready to put
this thing back together,

38:43.450 --> 38:44.850
And now I can't.

38:44.850 --> 38:46.780
Well, the only place you'd get
a cluster gear

38:46.790 --> 38:47.990
For a '39 ford transmission

38:47.990 --> 38:49.590
Is from somebody
who hoards that crap.

38:49.590 --> 38:51.120
Luckily, I'm that guy.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.730
I can't guarantee I'm going
to actually have one.

38:53.730 --> 38:55.460
So I grab jeremy and headed
to my shop.

38:55.460 --> 38:56.800
I figure he's got a fresh set
of eyes

38:56.800 --> 38:58.730
To help me spot
the part we need.

38:58.730 --> 39:01.470
I knew there would be problems
we couldn't foresee.

39:01.470 --> 39:03.000
There always are.
Right.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.140
Besides, he's the only
that hasn't been to my place

39:05.140 --> 39:06.770
And doesn't give me
a hard time about it.

39:08.470 --> 39:10.340
Dude.
I can tell from here,

39:10.340 --> 39:12.280
This is as bad
as they said it is.

39:12.280 --> 39:15.880
This is old stuff
galore, man.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.750
You know where it's at?
-No.

39:17.750 --> 39:20.150
Is there where steering columns
go to die?

39:20.150 --> 39:21.290
That's very funny.

39:21.290 --> 39:23.220
You have, like,
a whole plethora.

39:23.220 --> 39:24.420
Hold on.
This might be it.

39:24.420 --> 39:27.760
Let me see
the one you got.

39:27.760 --> 39:28.490
Yeah, that's it.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.630
Brian: So there.

39:29.630 --> 39:31.630
My stash of parts
just saved me a ton time.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.160
You might thing this is, like,
a dirty shop,

39:33.170 --> 39:34.900
But it just saved our ass.

39:38.300 --> 39:39.770
Jason: Look what I got.

39:39.770 --> 39:41.110
Is that
the mysterious engine?

39:41.110 --> 39:42.440
That's
the mysterious engine.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.040
This is as much of it
as I've seen, so...

39:45.050 --> 39:46.380
-The box?
-Yeah.

39:46.380 --> 39:48.180
-This just looks like a box.
-Big moment.

39:48.180 --> 39:49.980
Brian: While jeremy and I
were at my shop,

39:49.980 --> 39:51.050
The guys kept on trucking.

39:51.050 --> 39:52.250
Mike got the chassis painted,

39:52.250 --> 39:53.850
So now jeremy can work
on the pedal assembly,

39:53.850 --> 39:55.650
And that means soon we'll
stabbing the motor in the truck.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.060
Small-block.

39:57.060 --> 39:59.790
Hey, it looks good already.
It's a flathead.

39:59.790 --> 40:01.190
Brian: When richard was trying
to get me to sell

40:01.190 --> 40:03.460
This truck to him,
he threw in a little sweetener.

40:03.460 --> 40:04.930
I've got an h&h flathead,

40:04.930 --> 40:06.930
All built in the box,
brand-new.

40:06.930 --> 40:07.730
That'd bolt right in there,
just about.

40:07.730 --> 40:08.800
Let's do it.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.070
I figured his flathead v-8

40:10.070 --> 40:12.540
Would be the perfect motor
for this build.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.070
Look at that.

40:14.070 --> 40:16.340
So he did actually
have an engine.

40:16.340 --> 40:17.810
-Yep.
-It's got cobwebs on it.

40:17.810 --> 40:21.350
That's got three carburetors
on it, fin heads.

40:21.350 --> 40:22.880
Wait.
-Offenhauser.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.480
There is
a slight issue here.

40:24.480 --> 40:26.280
This isn't gonna bolt
into our truck the way it is.

40:26.290 --> 40:27.490
Oh.

40:27.490 --> 40:30.550
This is
a late-model flathead.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.090
You know, like, they changed
them between '48 and '49.

40:32.090 --> 40:33.490
This is
a '49 to '53 flathead,

40:33.490 --> 40:35.160
And that is not
gonna fit that frame

40:35.160 --> 40:37.430
Without
changing some stuff.

40:37.430 --> 40:38.830
Our initial plan was to take it
out of the box

40:38.830 --> 40:40.230
And bolt it into the truck.

40:40.230 --> 40:41.770
That's what richard said
we could do.

40:41.770 --> 40:43.170
You're talking changing the
motor or changing the chassis?

40:43.170 --> 40:44.840
We got to take this motor
almost completely apart.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.840
All this front stuff
on the engine

40:46.840 --> 40:48.740
Is not really gonna work
with what we got here.

40:48.740 --> 40:51.180
We need to get with chad
to get immediately here

40:51.180 --> 40:52.840
What need
for this to convert it.

40:52.850 --> 40:54.910
-It too long or something?
-Yeah, it won't fit.

40:54.910 --> 40:56.450
The way
the motor mounts are,

40:56.450 --> 40:58.050
They're for
a later-model frame.

40:58.050 --> 41:00.050
Man #4: What a sweet,
ready-to-go engine, richard.

41:00.050 --> 41:01.850
You and I have to get a parts
list together

41:01.860 --> 41:04.460
Because this is going
to slow us down.

41:04.460 --> 41:06.060
Brian: So much for being ahead
of schedule.

41:06.060 --> 41:08.460
Now we're gonna lose a whole
day modifying the motor,

41:08.460 --> 41:10.660
Not to mention hunting
down replacement parts.

41:10.660 --> 41:11.800
So you know what?

41:11.800 --> 41:12.860
For once, this one is on you,
richard.

41:12.870 --> 41:14.600
Let's go, bass.

41:18.210 --> 41:21.140
Narrator:
Next week on "fast n' loud,"

41:21.140 --> 41:24.340
As the monkeys keep cranking
on the '33 ford...

41:24.340 --> 41:25.540
Ugh, I knew
that was gonna happen.

41:25.550 --> 41:27.610
...Richard puts their feet
to the fire.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.550
I'm really, really freaking
pressed for time.

41:29.550 --> 41:32.150
We're the last people that want
to be taking it back apart.

41:32.150 --> 41:35.090
Narrator: ...And may cause them
to burn out.

41:35.090 --> 41:36.350
Stop.

41:36.360 --> 41:37.620
Brian: I've seen lots of weird
stuff on these cars,

41:37.620 --> 41:38.620
And this one is
kind of blowing my mind.

41:38.630 --> 41:45.900
Narrator:
Then richard goes for the gold

41:45.900 --> 41:47.770
In the monster jam
world finals...

41:47.770 --> 41:50.100
I want to win. I want to be
first place every time.

41:50.100 --> 41:52.640
Narrator: ...By throttling
son-uva digger.
