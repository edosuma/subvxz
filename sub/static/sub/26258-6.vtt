[Soren] <i>Previously on </i>The Dragon Prince...

00:21.480 --> 00:23.607
[Callum] <i>Humans and elves </i>
<i>don't trust each other.</i>

00:23.690 --> 00:27.027
That won't change
until we take this egg back to Xadia.

00:27.819 --> 00:30.155
[Runaan]<i> Rayla, we bound ourselves.</i>

00:30.239 --> 00:32.115
<i>There's only one way to release.</i>

00:33.784 --> 00:36.620
[Viren] <i>A party of our best </i>
<i>will be dispatched immediately</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:37.579
<i>to find the princes.</i>

00:38.163 --> 00:40.082
<i>I will task my own children,</i>

00:40.165 --> 00:43.460
<i>Soren and Claudia,</i>
<i>with leading the rescue expedition.</i>

00:46.213 --> 00:48.215
Listen, I need you to give me the egg.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.467
I have to get it to the roof right away.

00:50.550 --> 00:51.593
What? Why?

00:51.677 --> 00:53.679
Just trust me.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.891
[theme music playing]

01:12.406 --> 01:13.949
[roaring]

[leaves rustling]

02:27.814 --> 02:29.775
[breathes deeply]

02:30.984 --> 02:33.153
You scared me, you wee cutie.

02:37.908 --> 02:42.537
Thanks, little one. But my hand's got
a problem you can't lick away.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.248
What's the matter?

02:48.210 --> 02:49.336
[Rayla grunting]

02:50.837 --> 02:52.756
Never trapped an elf before.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.174
Easier than I thought.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.140
[Rayla yells]

03:05.352 --> 03:06.645
[yawns]

03:12.359 --> 03:15.028
Callum? I think we're alone.

03:16.488 --> 03:20.534
Finally... Oh, I've been waiting
for this moment.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.618
Callum?

03:21.701 --> 03:25.288
Mmm. Your breath still smells
like peanut butter.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.456
Callum!

03:27.124 --> 03:29.751
-What... what?
-Wake up! Rayla's missing.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.962
Oh, no, did she take it?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.296
The egg's still right here.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.382
[sighs] Okay, good.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.134
You know, that still doesn't mean
we can trust her.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.302
But I like her, Callum.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.431
Hey, I like her, too.
But the thing is, she's--

03:42.514 --> 03:44.391
An elf? Who cares?

03:44.474 --> 03:47.602
It seems maybe everything
we've ever heard about elves is wrong.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.147
No. I was gonna say, the thing is...

03:50.230 --> 03:51.815
she's not telling us everything.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.650
I can feel it.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.088
[yelps]

04:18.300 --> 04:20.677
Give me the boys peacefully,
and I'll let you go!

04:20.761 --> 04:22.137
Release your prisoners.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.097
They're not prisoners.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.308
They choose to travel with me.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.060
What? Why would they trust you?

04:29.144 --> 04:30.395
[Rayla screaming]

04:30.479 --> 04:34.357
Because we're in this together!
They're my friends now. [grunts]

04:34.441 --> 04:37.152
Friends? You killed their father!

04:37.235 --> 04:39.154
I didn't kill anyone.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.656
Your leader did. What's the difference?

04:42.699 --> 04:43.658
[screams]

04:44.242 --> 04:45.202
[grunting]

04:52.626 --> 04:54.544
Wait. They don't know, do they?

04:56.004 --> 04:57.214
[Corvus screams]

05:02.219 --> 05:03.094
[chains rattling]

05:03.804 --> 05:05.430
When they find out, they'll hate you.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.681
Shut up!

05:12.562 --> 05:14.815
[both grunting and shouting]

05:22.280 --> 05:23.615
[panting]

05:28.954 --> 05:33.667
[Corvus] Savor your victory, elf.
Next time you won't be so lucky.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.585
Says the guy in the ditch!

05:41.132 --> 05:45.428
So, did you know you were
kind of sleep-talking before?

05:46.179 --> 05:48.431
What were you dreaming about?

05:48.515 --> 05:49.641
Uh...

05:49.724 --> 05:53.019
I don't remember. Why? I didn't, like,
say anyone's name out loud, did I?

05:53.103 --> 05:56.022
No, but you said something about
peanut butter--

05:56.106 --> 05:57.566
Sandwiches. [chuckles nervously]

05:57.649 --> 05:59.150
Yep, I remember now.

05:59.234 --> 06:00.986
I was having a dream about sandwiches.

06:01.653 --> 06:05.282
You seemed weirdly excited
about sandwiches.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.366
[chuckles nervously]

06:07.033 --> 06:10.287
You know what? In a few years,
when you're older, buddy...

06:10.370 --> 06:13.999
we'll sit down and have
a heart-to-heart talk about sandwiches.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.006
Go, go, go! We've gotta move.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.049
What's going on? Where were you?

06:23.133 --> 06:24.801
We should eat something first.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.387
-Look how grumpy Bait is right now.
-[Bait grumbling]

06:27.470 --> 06:29.222
Ugh. There's no time!

06:29.306 --> 06:30.724
We have to get moving now.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.143
Rayla, why? You have to at least explain--

06:33.226 --> 06:36.146
I don't have to explain anything to you.
Let's go!

06:37.397 --> 06:38.440
Fine. Fine!

06:40.775 --> 06:41.693
[sighs]

06:47.574 --> 06:48.825
[Soren grunting]

07:02.047 --> 07:04.174
I love having meetings up here.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.344
I get a nice leg workout
going up all those stairs.

07:08.011 --> 07:11.181
We have important things to discuss.
Try and focus.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.474
No problem.

07:12.557 --> 07:15.101
You have my undivided attention.

07:15.936 --> 07:19.314
This evening, you and your sister
depart on a mission.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.191
Searching for the princes.

07:21.274 --> 07:25.362
[grunts] Oh, yeah.
That's the good kind of burn.

07:25.445 --> 07:29.282
The outcome of your mission is critical
to the future of our kingdom.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.451
[chuckles] We got this. We'll find them.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.954
I'm sure you will.

07:34.037 --> 07:37.958
But there's a bit of nuance
to this situation.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.043
No idea what nuance is.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.879
Listen closely.

07:42.963 --> 07:47.425
You are to return with the terrible news
that the princes have perished.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.760
Wait.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.720
Excuse me?

07:51.638 --> 07:55.058
I think my head was upside down
and it got sort of mixed up.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.393
Can you say that again?

07:56.476 --> 08:02.983
You are to return with the terrible news
that both princes have died.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.532
Wait. This path is too easy.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.244
No, it's not.
It's exactly the right amount of easy.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.497
No. It's well-worn, it's flat, it's soft.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.418
Sooner or later,
we're going to run into somebody.

08:24.254 --> 08:28.216
We need to go up that way.
Tougher terrain is safer for us.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.509
The tougher, the better.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.095
-Well, that sounds terrible.
-Exactly.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.596
This is already tough enough.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.975
Do you have any idea
how heavy this egg is?

08:37.058 --> 08:38.727
Uh, no, I don't.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.812
Because you won't trust me to carry it.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.522
Well, should we trust you?

08:42.605 --> 08:44.315
Have you told us
the truth about everything?

08:44.399 --> 08:48.695
[sighs] Fine, keep carrying
the extremely heavy egg.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.949
But quit crying about it.
We're going up this way.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.246
[Soren] So, hold up.

08:58.329 --> 09:01.374
If we return with the news
that the princes have died...

09:01.875 --> 09:03.626
won't that mean we failed?

09:04.377 --> 09:07.630
The coming war will determine
the fate of humanity.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.550
History has come to
a crucial tipping point.

09:10.633 --> 09:13.553
So you're saying,
things could go either way?

09:13.636 --> 09:15.013
[Viren] Precisely.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.848
Like a see-saw.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.559
Yes.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.395
History is like... a see-saw.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.566
If we are strong enough
to make the right decisions,

09:26.649 --> 09:28.943
humans may finally return to Xadia,

09:29.027 --> 09:33.406
and take back the great magical lands
that are rightfully ours.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.117
But if we are led by a child king...

09:36.201 --> 09:38.536
He'll make bad choices?

09:38.620 --> 09:41.498
He will make weak choices!

09:41.581 --> 09:43.833
History will tip the wrong way...

09:43.917 --> 09:47.003
and the forces of Xadia will crush
not only Katolis,

09:47.087 --> 09:49.089
but all the five kingdoms!

09:49.172 --> 09:53.343
Okay. So I'm supposed to come back
with the news that they're dead.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.513
What I don't understand is...

09:57.180 --> 10:00.016
what am I supposed to do
if we find them alive?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.434
Oh...

10:01.518 --> 10:03.728
you'll know the right thing to do.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.524
The right thing. I...

10:07.607 --> 10:09.192
I don't know if I can do that.

10:09.275 --> 10:13.988
Out there, in the wild,
accidents happen every day.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.366
Deadly accidents.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.785
My son.

10:19.536 --> 10:23.623
This won't be easy, but you are strong.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.126
Now, tell no one. Not even Claudia.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.712
You must carry this weight alone.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.507
[inhales sharply]

10:34.467 --> 10:38.388
[Viren] It will be a burden for me
to take the throne.

10:38.471 --> 10:42.600
And someday that throne
will belong to you.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.064
[sighs] All right!

10:48.148 --> 10:51.317
Let's stop and eat. I'm starving.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.487
Uh...

10:55.905 --> 10:57.407
Oh, no.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.242
-I don't have the food.
-[Rayla] What?

10:59.325 --> 11:03.413
You had one job:
carry your stale human food.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.831
How could you leave it?

11:04.914 --> 11:06.207
You rushed us!

11:06.291 --> 11:09.752
You were yelling at us, and I just...
You made me leave it!

11:09.836 --> 11:11.337
Oh. That's right.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.756
Because I remember yelling three things...

11:13.840 --> 11:16.593
"Hurry, hurry." "Let's go, go, go.'"

11:16.676 --> 11:20.805
And, "Be sure to abandon all the supplies
you need to survive."

11:22.015 --> 11:24.851
What are we going to do?
We're out of food!

11:25.560 --> 11:30.315
Well, I suppose I'd be willing to share
my moonberry juice with you.

11:30.398 --> 11:33.526
It's packed with super nutrients,
and I still have plenty--

11:34.110 --> 11:35.528
Still had plenty.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.906
Someone drank it all!
Who went through my stuff?

11:37.989 --> 11:40.742
-I didn't touch your things!
-Don't look at me!

11:40.825 --> 11:42.118
Well, I didn't drink it.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.704
If one of you didn't sneak it, then who?

11:44.787 --> 11:45.622
[Bait hiccups]

11:46.664 --> 11:47.540
Wait.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.877
-Did that little frog monster--
-[hiccups]

11:51.920 --> 11:54.672
Bait wouldn't do that!
You have no reason to think--

11:54.756 --> 11:56.633
-[Bait hiccups]
-Don't accuse him!

11:56.716 --> 11:58.134
Look at how he's glowing!

11:58.217 --> 12:01.721
Well, Bait glows different ways
depending on how he's feeling.

12:01.804 --> 12:07.226
Like, he has one color if he's lonely.
Or he glows another way if he's hungry.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.646
Or angry. Or hangry!

12:09.729 --> 12:11.981
That's when you're so hungry
that you're angry...

12:12.065 --> 12:14.776
[scoffs] I know what "hangry" means.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.404
So what does that color mean?

12:19.697 --> 12:24.243
Hmm. Actually, I've never seen him
glow that way before.

12:24.327 --> 12:27.413
Kind of a reddish, purplish...
berry color.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.331
[burps]

12:28.998 --> 12:30.041
Yeah, he did it.

12:30.667 --> 12:31.668
[Rayla sighs]

12:32.919 --> 12:34.545
I think she's hangry.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.382
I'm habsolutely hurious!

12:59.862 --> 13:00.989
[sizzles]

13:05.368 --> 13:07.787
Speak your true nature to me.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.165
[chanting]

13:15.128 --> 13:16.129
Nothing?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.297
You are a stubborn magic mirror.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.425
You think I haven't tried that?

13:20.508 --> 13:22.969
I've cast eight different reveal spells.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.804
They all failed.

13:24.887 --> 13:29.392
At the end, I see nothing but my own
frustrated face staring back at me.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.561
Well, maybe it's just a mirror.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.645
[Viren sighs]

13:32.729 --> 13:35.565
Of all the treasures, artifacts and relics

13:35.648 --> 13:38.317
in the lair
of the Dragon King and Queen...

13:38.401 --> 13:40.737
they kept this close to where they slept.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.406
It must be important.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.409
Then we'll figure it out.
Whatever it takes.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.996
Hear that, mirror?
I'm putting you on notice.

13:51.414 --> 13:54.083
Kind of weird how the mirror
did it right back at me.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.252
Like it was putting me on notice.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.380
We have something important to discuss.

13:59.464 --> 14:00.757
Your mission.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.842
-To rescue the princes.
-Yes,

14:02.925 --> 14:06.679
but you will have a secret mission
that is far more important.

14:06.763 --> 14:07.722
Claudia,

14:08.347 --> 14:10.850
you must recover that dragon egg.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.936
They have it with them,
so shouldn't be a problem.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.438
Princes, egg...

14:15.521 --> 14:19.025
I've got room for a third mission
if you need anything else while we're out.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.110
The egg cannot fall into the wrong hands.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.946
It is too powerful, too dangerous.

14:24.030 --> 14:29.285
Whatever happens, whatever accidents
or tragedies may occur...

14:29.369 --> 14:32.789
above all else,
you must return with that egg!

14:32.872 --> 14:34.624
-I understand.
-Good.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.292
One question.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.379
Let's say we're attacked
by giant bumble-scorps,

14:39.462 --> 14:41.381
and they're all buzzing like...

14:41.464 --> 14:42.965
[buzzing]

14:43.049 --> 14:44.884
...and flailing their scorps at us like...

14:44.967 --> 14:46.803
[buzzes rhythmically]

14:46.886 --> 14:51.057
...and I'm forced to choose between
saving the egg and saving Soren.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.017
What should I do?

14:55.728 --> 14:57.480
Dad, it's a joke.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.315
Relax, I'm kidding.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.900
[buzzes and chuckles]

15:00.983 --> 15:03.319
Everything will be fine.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.238
The egg.

15:06.406 --> 15:10.076
If you have to choose, choose the egg.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.088
Rayla, can you slow down?
It's getting a little tricky.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.842
Rayla! Come on!

15:25.925 --> 15:28.177
You're the one who made us
take this crazy route,

15:28.261 --> 15:29.470
at least let us keep up with you.

15:29.554 --> 15:33.391
I just need to put this down a second
and catch my breath.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.185
There is a solution, you know.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.062
You can just let me carry the egg.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.108
You realize that
I could just take it, right?

15:42.191 --> 15:44.944
I could just take it from you
any time I wanted.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.280
Yeah, that's good, Rayla.
Way to increase trust.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.157
But I don't. That's the point.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.367
Oh, well, congratulations!

15:51.451 --> 15:53.953
You haven't threatened us
and forced us to give you the egg?

15:54.036 --> 15:55.246
You deserve a medal.

15:55.329 --> 15:58.708
-You're a hero! [echoing]
-[cracking in distance]

15:58.791 --> 16:01.586
[Rayla] I could take it! I could return it
to Xadia on my own...

16:01.669 --> 16:03.254
Guys, you need to keep it down...

16:03.337 --> 16:04.255
...I would be a hero!

16:04.338 --> 16:05.798
Then what's stopping you?

16:05.882 --> 16:07.800
Because it has to come from you.

16:07.884 --> 16:11.179
Human princes,
returning the egg to the Dragon Queen.

16:11.262 --> 16:12.555
That's the gesture that matters.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.974
That could end the war,
and change the world--

16:15.057 --> 16:16.309
[Ezran shushes]

16:16.392 --> 16:18.895
You guys need to stop fighting. Look!

16:18.978 --> 16:21.314
[ice cracking]

16:21.397 --> 16:23.733
All your yelling is cracking the ice.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.736
If we're not careful,
we could start an avalanche.

16:26.819 --> 16:27.945
-Got it?
-Uh-huh.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.071
Not a peep.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.074
Good. It stopped cracking.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.122
[burps]

16:38.873 --> 16:40.124
[burp echoing]

16:50.051 --> 16:50.885
Run!

16:58.809 --> 16:59.644
[screams]

17:04.023 --> 17:05.191
[groans]

17:05.274 --> 17:08.444
-What happened to your hand?
-Don't worry about it. Just run!

17:12.615 --> 17:13.783
We're not going to make it!

17:13.866 --> 17:15.660
It's like a... snow-nami!

17:17.703 --> 17:20.706
-Callum, what are you doing?
-Get behind me.

17:22.708 --> 17:23.709
[Bait whimpers]

17:26.879 --> 17:28.256
<i>Aspiro!</i>

17:28.923 --> 17:29.966
[exhales]

17:39.600 --> 17:40.643
[pants]

17:41.477 --> 17:42.562
[all screaming]

17:50.111 --> 17:51.153
[gasps]

17:56.075 --> 17:57.326
Is everyone okay?

17:58.786 --> 17:59.912
[grunts]

17:59.996 --> 18:02.915
Where's that hiccuping, juice-thief frog?

18:07.920 --> 18:10.006
He's right there, and he's okay.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.299
We all made it!

18:13.509 --> 18:14.844
I'll go get the egg.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.436
[Callum] Ez! Don't move.
We're coming to get you.

18:36.907 --> 18:40.953
Hey, Sor-bear. What's wrong?
You look kind of down.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.666
Aw, grizzly, grizzly Sor-bear! [chuckles]

18:45.750 --> 18:49.128
Did Dad say anything strange to you?

18:49.879 --> 18:51.964
Yeah, he kind of did.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.216
Did he say anything strange to you?

18:54.300 --> 18:55.468
Uh...

18:55.551 --> 19:00.222
No. Totally not, just a standard Dad chat.
What? [chuckles nervously]

19:00.848 --> 19:03.225
Oh. Okay, I guess.

19:03.309 --> 19:07.146
So... what did he say to you
that was so strange?

19:09.315 --> 19:13.402
Uh, he said that walnuts
are his favorite... fruit!

19:14.070 --> 19:16.906
I mean, that's crazy, right?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.784
-I don't even think they're a fruit.
-They're not.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.494
Well, that is strange.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.705
I mean, what's his favorite vegetable,
ice cream?

19:24.789 --> 19:27.875
[laughs, snorts]

19:27.958 --> 19:29.377
[laughs]

19:29.460 --> 19:32.755
Anyway. Are you ready for our mission?

19:32.838 --> 19:34.840
Yeah. I guess I am.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.343
Great. I'm sure you won't die.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.512
-What?
-On this mission.

19:39.595 --> 19:44.225
I mean, eventually you will die. I assume.
But who knows?

19:44.308 --> 19:46.102
Maybe you won't!

19:46.185 --> 19:47.603
Thanks, Claudia.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.537
Stay still, we're almost there.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.463
Easy does it. Just pass it over.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.594
What now?

20:22.388 --> 20:24.724
Now... I'm going to hand you the egg.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.394
I'm sorry if I was a jerk before, Rayla.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.230
We're lucky to have you as our friend.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.815
I do trust you.

20:34.567 --> 20:38.571
No, wait. I don't deserve your trust...
Not yet.

20:38.654 --> 20:39.989
I need to tell you the truth.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.826
This morning, the big rush was because
I was attacked by someone.

20:43.909 --> 20:47.037
A human. I fought him off,
but it was hard.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.414
Because of this.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.917
-You don't need to do this right now.
-Yes, I do.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.544
This is an assassin's binding.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.921
A Moonshadow elf ritual.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.341
Before I met you, I swore an oath.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.760
I bound myself...

21:01.677 --> 21:03.387
to end Prince Ezran's life.

21:03.471 --> 21:06.182
And this binding will never come off
while he's alive.

21:06.265 --> 21:10.436
It will just get tighter and tighter
until I lose my hand.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.438
But I'm ready to pay that price.

21:14.690 --> 21:18.986
Thank you for telling us,
but we need to focus on the situation.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.405
There's one more thing.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.368
The night I met you,
something bad happened.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.204
-[ice cracking]
-Rayla, there's no time.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.915
Callum, I need to tell you. The King--

21:31.874 --> 21:32.958
Just take it!

21:33.918 --> 21:34.919
[groans]

21:40.883 --> 21:44.220
-You dropped it!
-I just told you my hand was messed up.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.930
Well, use the other hand!

21:46.013 --> 21:48.974
Stop arguing! We have to do something.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.936
Ez, no! Ezran!

21:52.728 --> 21:54.563
-I'm going in after him.
-Don't!

21:55.481 --> 21:56.649
What? Why?

21:56.732 --> 21:58.734
He'll get it. He'll save the egg.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.736
We have to believe in him.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.738
And we're going to need to be up here
to pull him out.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.616
-He's just a kid!
-He's brave and strong.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.201
He can do this.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.165
Come on. Come on!

22:13.249 --> 22:15.584
It's going to be okay. Ez will get it.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.272
[sighs] You were wrong.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.607
He's not coming back.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.360
I'm so sorry.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.280
I thought he would be able to.

22:49.076 --> 22:52.288
He's alive! The binding is still tight.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.872
Ez is still alive.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.457
He has to be.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.587
[knocking]

23:06.302 --> 23:07.845
[grunting]

23:17.563 --> 23:18.856
[Callum grunts]

23:23.360 --> 23:24.403
Ezran?

23:25.362 --> 23:29.366
Ez... Ez, you saved it.
You got the egg back. You did it!

23:30.075 --> 23:33.495
Please, Ezran, you gotta be okay.
Just say something.

23:39.835 --> 23:44.590
[shivering] I think I got
a case of the frozie-toesies.

23:45.674 --> 23:46.675
[Callum chuckling]

23:46.759 --> 23:48.802
[Callum and Rayla exclaim]

23:51.513 --> 23:52.348
Oh, no.

23:59.229 --> 24:01.231
Something's wrong with the egg.
