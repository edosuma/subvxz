(INDISTINCT SPEAKING)

00:56.626 --> 00:59.717
Mrs. Quigley, age 46,

00:59.746 --> 01:01.127
been suffering for several days

01:01.133 --> 01:03.389
since experiencing a
blow to the stomach.

01:03.424 --> 01:05.291
Will you describe your symptoms, ma'am?

01:05.313 --> 01:07.171
I've explained it already.

01:07.723 --> 01:09.119
It hurts here.

01:10.123 --> 01:13.886
The patient reports abdominal
radiating to the left shoulder.

01:13.904 --> 01:15.765
And she's been dizzy and tired.

01:17.161 --> 01:20.574
I get tired every time I come
to this godforsaken place.

01:20.652 --> 01:23.632
These symptoms are consistent
with a lacerated spleen, sir.

01:23.664 --> 01:24.931
Surgery is indicated.

01:24.935 --> 01:28.200
And how would you expose the spleen
to repair the damage, Dr. Dixon?

01:28.223 --> 01:30.486
By partial excision of one or more ribs,

01:30.509 --> 01:33.990
followed by subpleural or
transpleural exposure of the spleen.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.603
Very well.

01:35.888 --> 01:37.204
Excuse me, Dr. Forbes?

01:37.215 --> 01:39.547
Would it be preferable
to do a vertical incision

01:39.558 --> 01:41.427
of the left linear semilunaris?

01:41.464 --> 01:42.782
Preferable how?

01:43.036 --> 01:45.715
A shorter, more comfortable
recovery time for the patient

01:45.733 --> 01:47.381
if the ribs are not excised.

01:49.982 --> 01:51.787
Very good, Dr. Ogden.

01:52.152 --> 01:53.765
The surgery is in one-half hour.

01:54.130 --> 01:56.160
Prepare to assist. The
rest of you may observe.

01:56.182 --> 01:57.531
Oh, uh...

02:01.599 --> 02:03.445
- George.
- Sir.

02:03.946 --> 02:07.063
Sir! I wasn't expecting you in today.

02:07.089 --> 02:09.300
- Have we had a murder?
- No, no, no.

02:09.370 --> 02:12.001
I'm simply looking for my... aha!

02:12.303 --> 02:14.522
- Switch sequencer.
- Oh.

02:18.085 --> 02:20.210
It's a beautiful day outside, George.

02:20.254 --> 02:22.943
Why don't you go for a
walk along the boardwalk?

02:23.176 --> 02:24.234
The boardwalk, sir.

02:24.259 --> 02:27.052
The boardwalk is always teeming
with happy young couples.

02:27.351 --> 02:29.300
They always come out
when the sun shines.

02:29.425 --> 02:32.206
We have a call of a
pickpocket at Wilton and Yonge.

02:33.101 --> 02:34.999
Oh, then. Excellent.

02:35.677 --> 02:37.324
Prepped and ready, Doctor.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.202
Gauze.

02:44.262 --> 02:45.530
Very good.

02:48.485 --> 02:50.894
I believe the spleen is enlarged.

02:53.002 --> 02:54.454
More gauze.

02:55.684 --> 02:57.512
The patient is an inebrient.

02:58.171 --> 03:01.939
Enlarged spleens are a side
effect of chronic alcohol use.

03:02.199 --> 03:04.307
Can you see the laceration?

03:07.335 --> 03:09.016
Yes, there it is.

03:09.098 --> 03:13.262
Would you recommend repairing the
laceration or a complete splenectomy?

03:13.953 --> 03:16.269
Due to the enlargement, a splenectomy.

03:16.394 --> 03:17.747
I agree.

03:17.789 --> 03:20.534
Go ahead, bring the spleen
forward into the wound.

03:23.716 --> 03:25.591
There's an adhesion to the diaphragm.

03:25.614 --> 03:27.171
You'll need to separate that.

03:27.405 --> 03:28.732
Scissors.

03:34.825 --> 03:36.327
(EXHALING SHARPLY)

03:36.502 --> 03:37.989
I've gone through the diaphragm.

03:38.026 --> 03:39.979
- Heartbeat is erratic.
- She's bleeding.

03:41.140 --> 03:43.019
Can you see the injury?

03:45.515 --> 03:49.381
- The patient's pressure is falling.
- Do you want me to take over, Doctor?

03:54.609 --> 03:58.276
No. There it is. I can do it. Sutures.

04:05.928 --> 04:07.879
Ah. There.

04:11.713 --> 04:13.527
Heartbeat is normal.

04:14.885 --> 04:17.285
Very good work under pressure, Doctor.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.350
Shall we continue?

04:20.624 --> 04:22.225
Scalpel.

04:22.714 --> 04:25.772
- Very well done, Dr. Ogden.
- Ah!

04:27.879 --> 04:29.629
Thank you.

04:30.614 --> 04:33.354
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

04:33.585 --> 04:37.301
The patient's son is looking for
news. Would you like to do the honour?

04:40.269 --> 04:42.176
Mr. Quigley.

04:42.219 --> 04:44.371
The surgery was quite successful.

04:44.394 --> 04:47.071
You can expect your mother to
have a comfortable recovery.

04:47.123 --> 04:49.783
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much.

04:49.806 --> 04:51.855
Dr. Forbes, there's an emergency.

04:51.878 --> 04:54.953
- It's Mrs. Quigley.
- Excuse me.

05:06.005 --> 05:08.245
OK. Get her up. Get her up.

05:10.450 --> 05:12.200
She's bradycardic.

05:12.252 --> 05:13.973
She's likely bleeding internally.

05:13.985 --> 05:16.213
Get her back to the operating
theater, we'll re-open.

05:16.271 --> 05:18.042
She's still not breathing.

05:27.129 --> 05:28.793
She's gone.

for a student to assist!

05:54.767 --> 05:56.984
Unfortunately, there were complications.

05:56.995 --> 05:59.275
The spleen was enlarged,
there were growths...

05:59.281 --> 06:01.652
You told me it went well!
That she would be all right!

06:01.675 --> 06:03.061
I'm so sorry, Mr. Quigley.

06:03.075 --> 06:06.147
- Everything seemed to be fine...
- And minutes later, she's dead!

06:06.345 --> 06:07.818
I understand you're upset.

06:07.828 --> 06:10.583
We really did everything we
could do to help your mother.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.263
What happened, then?

06:12.341 --> 06:13.861
I don't know, sir.

06:14.068 --> 06:16.145
But I promise you, if
something went wrong here,

06:16.164 --> 06:17.928
I will find out what it is.

We do not speak to family
members like that, Dr. Ogden.

06:29.364 --> 06:32.689
- I beg your pardon?
- That man's mother died a natural death.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.762
You should not have suggested otherwise.

06:34.799 --> 06:36.701
Well... but surely,

06:36.733 --> 06:38.764
we need to establish how she died.

06:38.787 --> 06:40.068
Dr. Ogden.

06:40.091 --> 06:43.342
You need not feel responsible
for Mrs. Quigley's death.

06:43.807 --> 06:45.115
I saw your work.

06:45.134 --> 06:46.921
I judged it to be correct.

06:46.938 --> 06:49.905
- Well, I understand, but...
- The spleen was more diseased

06:49.919 --> 06:51.461
than I anticipated.

06:51.586 --> 06:53.732
It simply could not be repaired in time.

Huh.

08:37.102 --> 08:38.534
Nurse.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.570
You administered the
anaesthetic to Mrs. Quigley.

08:42.573 --> 08:43.759
Yes.

08:43.768 --> 08:46.706
Did you feel her response
to the gas was normal?

08:46.734 --> 08:50.280
Yes, her response was normal, Dr. Ogden.

08:51.012 --> 08:52.978
Until she died, that is.

08:53.192 --> 08:54.762
I'm sure you're aware

08:54.771 --> 08:56.867
that anaesthetics carry some risk.

08:57.429 --> 08:59.299
I'm aware that the
Lancet Medical Journal

08:59.322 --> 09:02.177
has shown that chloroform
is nine times more likely

09:02.182 --> 09:03.761
to cause death than ether.

09:03.996 --> 09:06.980
- We use ether, of course.
- Of course.

09:07.376 --> 09:10.729
- So you observed no adverse reaction?
- No, I didn't.

09:10.918 --> 09:14.491
In fact the splenectomy was not
Mrs. Quigley's first operation,

09:14.533 --> 09:16.224
as you may have noticed from her chart.

09:16.237 --> 09:18.981
- Yes, of course, I...
- Since I had previously given her ether,

09:19.019 --> 09:21.064
I knew that she tolerated it well.

09:21.267 --> 09:24.560
Indeed, her pressure, pulse,
and breathing were all normal

09:24.685 --> 09:26.816
until the tear in her diaphragm.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.312
You believe that tear caused her death?

09:30.386 --> 09:32.722
I don't believe it was the anaesthetic.

09:34.596 --> 09:38.037
If you're looking to blame a nurse,
I suggest you tread carefully.

Well, you did all you could by
raising your concerns to him.

13:12.505 --> 13:15.354
Yes. Yes.

13:17.093 --> 13:19.436
And then I ordered a post-mortem.

13:20.680 --> 13:23.282
With Dr. Forbes' agreement?

13:23.748 --> 13:25.544
Not precisely.

13:25.806 --> 13:29.462
But hopefully Miss Hart will find
something that will catch his attention.

13:31.408 --> 13:33.043
If you don't suspect murder

13:33.060 --> 13:35.156
and she doesn't think she
made a mistake in the surgery,

13:35.179 --> 13:36.740
what exactly are we looking for?

13:36.763 --> 13:39.131
Perhaps this one is for peace of mind.

13:39.165 --> 13:40.793
My first thought, of course,

13:40.816 --> 13:43.648
was internal bleeding due
to the tear in the diaphragm,

13:43.670 --> 13:45.766
but her blood pressure
returned to normal.

13:45.795 --> 13:48.179
There doesn't appear to be
excess blood in the abdomen.

13:48.208 --> 13:50.281
- It would have dissipated by now.
- Ah.

13:50.322 --> 13:52.178
Excuse me, Doctor.

13:56.507 --> 13:59.386
The sutures on the
diaphragm are still intact.

13:59.423 --> 14:01.012
That's not your cause of death.

14:01.067 --> 14:02.624
Oh. Well, that's good news.

14:02.661 --> 14:04.149
I also considered the possibility

14:04.154 --> 14:06.351
of an adverse reaction
to the anaesthetic.

14:06.476 --> 14:09.403
I will certainly check the
liver for ether concentrations.

14:09.404 --> 14:12.918
Check as well for any type of
poison or allergic reaction.

14:13.144 --> 14:16.101
That... might not be necessary.

14:16.345 --> 14:17.809
Why do you say that?

14:18.136 --> 14:22.207
The sutures tying off the
splenic artery came loose.

14:22.382 --> 14:23.796
(JULIA): No!

14:24.147 --> 14:25.524
There,

14:25.703 --> 14:27.472
below the left costal arch.

14:28.457 --> 14:30.539
That must be a common occurrence,

14:30.718 --> 14:33.896
- sutures coming loose?
- I'm sure it happens.

14:34.311 --> 14:37.723
Sometimes the tissue is too
damaged to hold the sutures.

14:38.130 --> 14:40.833
But in this case, I
felt quite confident.

14:42.386 --> 14:44.536
So there was internal bleeding?

14:45.416 --> 14:46.812
Yes...

14:46.937 --> 14:49.091
Causing the heart to slow and stop.

14:51.343 --> 14:52.831
We know the cause of death.

14:52.845 --> 14:54.144
Yes.

14:55.281 --> 14:56.785
It was me.

14:56.910 --> 15:00.079
(MELANCHOLIC MUSIC)

15:04.769 --> 15:06.400
Dr. Forbes?

15:06.853 --> 15:10.033
I observed Mrs. Quigley's
post-mortem today.

15:10.084 --> 15:11.424
I beg your pardon?

15:11.650 --> 15:13.370
I didn't order a post-mortem.

15:13.372 --> 15:16.155
What made you believe you were
justified in going over my head?

15:16.233 --> 15:17.788
I'm sorry. I...

15:17.823 --> 15:19.780
I wanted to know what happened.

15:19.814 --> 15:22.149
Did the results put your mind at rest?

15:22.815 --> 15:25.878
It seems the cause of death
was a failure of my sutures.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.522
I trust this puts an
end to your inquiry?

15:29.263 --> 15:30.451
Yes.

15:30.479 --> 15:33.846
I lost a patient just last month
under similar circumstances.

15:33.862 --> 15:35.748
- You did?
- Yes.

15:35.771 --> 15:39.210
I'll admit I took it to
heart myself for a time.

15:40.833 --> 15:43.067
Take my advice, Dr. Ogden.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.672
Have a stiff drink

15:44.706 --> 15:46.740
and then you get back to work.

15:51.166 --> 15:54.013
So then, I looked into this
other patient, a Mr. Ross.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.626
He also died following routine surgery.

15:56.751 --> 15:58.549
People die in hospitals.

15:58.623 --> 16:01.865
Yes, but what if these two
cases are somehow related?

16:02.224 --> 16:05.593
The results of the post-mortem
showed a natural death.

16:05.627 --> 16:09.096
- One mistake with sutures...
- But I don't believe I made a mistake.

16:09.124 --> 16:11.756
Then how do you explain
Miss Hart's findings?

16:11.881 --> 16:13.558
Pardon?

16:20.266 --> 16:22.543
The post-mortem results
were quite clear.

16:23.835 --> 16:25.314
Yes.

16:25.366 --> 16:29.051
Miss Hart concluded
that the sutures failed,

16:29.086 --> 16:32.477
causing the heart to stop.
The obvious alternative...

16:32.602 --> 16:34.734
- (LOUD MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
- is that the...

16:34.859 --> 16:37.002
the heart failed first,

16:37.077 --> 16:41.028
and then the sutures were damaged
during the resuscitation efforts.

16:41.594 --> 16:43.430
How did the heart fail?

16:44.551 --> 16:47.644
Something must have
happened after the surgery.

16:48.088 --> 16:51.572
Are you saying someone deliberately
tried to kill Mrs. Quigley?

16:52.486 --> 16:55.638
It may have been human error.

17:05.298 --> 17:07.463
in order to leave murder behind.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.556
Yes. I did.

17:10.059 --> 17:12.292
But what if it's followed me?

17:17.221 --> 17:19.580
You were assigned to
sit with Mrs. Quigley

17:19.601 --> 17:21.435
following her surgery, is that correct?

17:21.560 --> 17:24.568
Yes, Nurse Sullivan
signed her over to me.

17:24.643 --> 17:27.117
Very good. And I
understand you're instructed

17:27.135 --> 17:28.649
not to leave the patient.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.603
No. I am to stay at the bedside

17:31.620 --> 17:34.181
and watch for any signs of trouble.

17:34.215 --> 17:37.101
And you did that for Mrs. Quigley?
You were with her constantly.

17:37.147 --> 17:38.919
Yes.

17:39.330 --> 17:41.978
Tell me about when
she went into distress.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.832
It came on suddenly.

17:43.849 --> 17:46.077
Her pulse was weak and...

17:46.118 --> 17:49.330
her breathing irregular. I
called for the Matron immediately.

17:49.364 --> 17:51.899
The anaesthetic nurse also responded?

17:51.933 --> 17:53.741
Nurse Sullivan? Yes.

17:53.752 --> 17:56.880
And the handsome resident
came over as well.

17:56.913 --> 17:59.423
- Dr. Dixon?
- Yes.

17:59.751 --> 18:01.231
So,

in the time before you
noticed Mrs. Quigley failing,

18:03.948 --> 18:06.487
no one but yourself came to her bedside?

No. No one at all.

would you like to hear first?

All right, personal news it
is! It is the weekend after all.

Very good, George.

Yes, well I'm glad you
think so, sir, because

I didn't want it to seem like
I didn't care for Miss Bloom.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.460
I got quite the opposite impression.

19:00.479 --> 19:03.491
Right, and I mean, life carries
on, after all, does it not?

sir, she's a nurse.

of a better possible match

19:07.935 --> 19:10.027
than a constable and a nurse?

19:10.091 --> 19:12.187
It's early days with
this young woman, but

19:12.213 --> 19:15.748
I know that she... is clever,

that her name is Miss Graham.

Dr. Ogden lost a patient yesterday,

19:39.938 --> 19:41.978
and afterward,

19:42.103 --> 19:44.083
called for all manner
of tests to be done

19:44.097 --> 19:45.847
concerning the cause of death. I mean,

19:45.972 --> 19:49.348
anaesthetic overdose, all
kinds of poisons and whatnot.

19:49.403 --> 19:51.287
They all came back negative.

19:51.453 --> 19:53.687
In fact, the only thing out
of the ordinary was some damage

19:53.696 --> 19:55.699
to the vein where the
injections had been made.

- So...

20:00.261 --> 20:02.198
pardon me for saying, sir, but...

20:02.461 --> 20:05.369
is it not possible that
Doctor Ogden simply...

20:05.997 --> 20:08.663
made a mistake and
doesn't want to admit it?

As a matter of fact,
I looked into the one

21:21.334 --> 21:24.687
you mentioned to me earlier,
Mr. Ross. It's also curious.

21:24.729 --> 21:26.562
I did not tell you about
that patient, Doctor,

we all must deal with failure.

Yes. But what if I didn't fail?

21:36.603 --> 21:39.361
I have seen arrogance in
this profession before.

precisely why I'm investigating.

responsibility to do so.

21:57.954 --> 21:59.045

21:59.055 --> 22:00.757
As head surgeon of this hospital,

22:00.783 --> 22:03.551
it is my responsibility to
ask you: are you a coroner

22:03.585 --> 22:05.214
or are you a surgeon?

22:07.799 --> 22:10.461
So, you came up with
this concoction yourself?

22:10.497 --> 22:12.981
I've been mixing it up
in my father's kitchen.

22:13.031 --> 22:14.904
He's fed up with the smells and mess

22:14.929 --> 22:18.167
but I think I've finally
struck on a good formula.

22:18.784 --> 22:21.095
I believe I can feel it working.

22:21.220 --> 22:23.386
There's a... a... a...

22:24.377 --> 22:26.265
There's a mild tingle!

22:26.288 --> 22:28.719
It's based on a treatment one
of the doctors at the hospital

22:28.743 --> 22:30.173
is using for burn victims.

22:30.209 --> 22:33.389
It occurred to me that if his
remedy could heal damaged skin,

22:33.419 --> 22:36.383
it might also help skin
ravaged by age and worry.

Well, that's very enterprising of you.

See, anybody who cares so much

22:43.341 --> 22:45.929
for others will surely
be a good nurse indeed.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.999
Was it something I said, Miss Graham?

You and everyone else I know
want me to be a good nurse.

But the truth is...

22:58.576 --> 23:01.657
- I'm not sure I'm good at all.
- Whatever gave you that idea?

23:02.122 --> 23:05.231
A patient in my care
died suddenly yesterday.

23:06.244 --> 23:08.699
I was supposed to be watching over them.

23:09.453 --> 23:12.384
I'm afraid Dr. Ogden
thinks I'm responsible.

23:13.165 --> 23:14.821

Will you put the kettle
on? We have work to do.

23:27.296 --> 23:30.418
- But I was going to...
- I have the chart for every patient

23:30.437 --> 23:33.044
who died following
surgery in the past year.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.407
Something is going on in that ward,

23:35.434 --> 23:37.074
and we are going to find out what.

23:39.017 --> 23:40.391
All right.

23:46.152 --> 23:47.702
So, out of all the patients

23:47.719 --> 23:50.201
who died following
surgery in the past year,

23:50.352 --> 23:52.135
four had symptoms in common

23:52.152 --> 23:54.604
with Mrs. Quigley and Mr. Ross.

23:54.794 --> 23:57.759
It's not a great number but I
wonder if it could be something.

23:57.884 --> 24:00.580
Does Miss Hart's report of irritation

24:00.586 --> 24:03.108
at the injection site
suggest anything to you?

24:03.154 --> 24:06.488
None of her medications were
likely to cause that reaction.

24:06.730 --> 24:10.230
So in all likelihood, we're
looking for some sort of poison.

me to speak with you.

to prepare her mouthwash.

with this preparation.

to fetch the mouthwash.

34:56.914 --> 34:59.009
He has a dear friend in New York City

34:59.032 --> 35:02.794
who has a place for a bookkeeper
at a real cosmetics company!

35:03.720 --> 35:05.115
New York City?

35:05.189 --> 35:07.348
I'm going to pursue my dreams!

35:07.358 --> 35:10.310
I'll get to see a cosmetics
business from the inside

35:10.347 --> 35:12.567
and meet all the best people.

35:12.692 --> 35:14.999
And it's all thanks
to your encouragement!

35:15.183 --> 35:16.486
That's wonderful.

35:16.942 --> 35:19.153
I can't thank you enough, George.

35:19.715 --> 35:22.018
Will you see me off
at the train next week?

35:23.313 --> 35:24.842
Union Station.

35:25.188 --> 35:26.708
I know it well.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.503
And yes, of course.

35:29.992 --> 35:31.428
Of course I will.

35:34.876 --> 35:36.389
(TENSE MUSIC)

35:36.453 --> 35:38.088
(MURDOCH): This way, gentlemen.

35:41.216 --> 35:42.962
What is this?

35:45.370 --> 35:47.899
I'm seizing staff records, Dr. Forbes.

35:47.977 --> 35:51.169
I have a reasonable suspicion
of foul play in this hospital.

35:51.220 --> 35:52.606
Multiple counts.

35:52.855 --> 35:56.576
I intend to find out who had
opportunity to commit these crimes.

36:05.912 --> 36:07.709
So, seven members of the attending staff

36:07.742 --> 36:10.214
were present at each of
these suspicious deaths.

36:10.426 --> 36:12.591
So, we interview them all,

36:12.646 --> 36:15.943
find out who among them has a
particular resentment toward alcoholics.

36:16.118 --> 36:17.441
We could search their homes;

36:17.459 --> 36:19.486
see if we can find something suspicious.

36:19.781 --> 36:22.609
Or... we could find the next victim.

36:23.124 --> 36:25.142
(KNOCKING)

36:25.837 --> 36:28.366
I thought I was finished
with the two of you.

36:28.491 --> 36:30.052
Not quite yet.

36:30.471 --> 36:32.663
We believe we know
how Mrs. Quigley died.

36:33.538 --> 36:35.602
She died because she was ill.

36:36.103 --> 36:38.905
Please, Doctor Forbes.
There's more to it than that.

36:43.605 --> 36:45.154
Go on, then.

36:46.061 --> 36:48.746
Someone on the ward is killing patients

36:48.750 --> 36:51.574
who come in with ailments
related to alcoholism.

36:52.062 --> 36:54.890
Preposterous. What proof have you?

36:55.107 --> 37:00.353
These habitual inebrients all somehow
died of the same cause of death.

37:00.399 --> 37:02.990
We don't believe it to be
medical error after all.

37:03.323 --> 37:05.931
We also have a list of
all of the staff members

37:05.943 --> 37:07.518
who were on duty at
the time of their deaths

37:07.528 --> 37:09.950
who had opportunity
to kill the patients.

37:12.774 --> 37:14.441
Am I on this list?

37:16.182 --> 37:17.440
You are.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.309
So, you can help vindicate yourself

37:20.314 --> 37:22.115
by assisting the investigation.

37:22.626 --> 37:24.320
And how would I do that?

37:24.445 --> 37:27.176
The next time someone with
this victim profile is admitted,

37:27.188 --> 37:29.523
we'd like to put a constable
on the ward undercover.

37:31.860 --> 37:35.651
Patients admitted with complaints
related to excessive alcohol use?

37:35.678 --> 37:37.046
Yes.

37:38.170 --> 37:40.767
Someone like that was
admitted yesterday.

37:42.053 --> 37:44.080
Surely, no one would
attempt to do this again,

37:44.094 --> 37:45.668
knowing that you have
been investigating.

37:45.692 --> 37:48.419
This person has been killing
with impunity for some time.

37:48.428 --> 37:51.011
And using a poison that
mimics natural causes.

37:51.045 --> 37:53.346
They may believe they are utterly safe.

37:58.750 --> 38:00.039
He's bradycardic.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.166
- What did you give him?
- I didn't give him anything. I just arrived.

38:03.190 --> 38:06.009
- If you didn't interfere with him, then who did?
- Who is this?

38:06.059 --> 38:07.713
Can't you see we're
trying to save a man?

38:07.732 --> 38:09.993
We need to know what the
poison is to help him!

38:10.030 --> 38:12.673
- Poison?
- Yes. I believe this man was poisoned,

38:12.696 --> 38:15.074
as well as Mrs. Quigley
and countless others.

38:15.199 --> 38:18.016
- Well it wasn't me.
- Who else was in here with him?

38:18.048 --> 38:21.585
No one, only the Matron was here
when Nurse Sullivan and I arrived.

38:22.520 --> 38:23.844
Matron Ingram?

38:24.307 --> 38:26.232
- Pulse?
- It's fading.

38:26.646 --> 38:28.890
- He's not responsive.
- What did you give him?

38:28.954 --> 38:30.096
Nothing.

38:30.152 --> 38:32.132
This man is a drunk.
He's made himself sick.

38:32.150 --> 38:34.822
Tell us what the poison
is and how to stop this!

38:34.988 --> 38:37.724
Save this man's life and hope
the courts will have mercy on you.

38:37.758 --> 38:40.827
- I have need of no one's mercy.
- You may need it soon.

38:40.862 --> 38:43.048
Saving this man's life
may mean the difference

38:43.064 --> 38:45.963
between you living or
hanging by your neck.

38:46.014 --> 38:48.078
He was warned. He was
told to stop drinking.

38:48.102 --> 38:50.871
Are you willing to die... for him?

38:51.103 --> 38:54.249
And with far less dignity
than you afforded your victims?

What about Crile's
chest compression method?

39:04.953 --> 39:08.287
- It's not accepted procedure.
- We have nothing to lose.

39:09.300 --> 39:10.390
Fine.

39:10.424 --> 39:11.994
Let's turn him.

39:14.292 --> 39:16.038
That's why we didn't find the poison.

39:16.066 --> 39:17.471
Elevated levels of potassium

And I can no longer ignore a truth

why love continually eludes him?

I mean, do I continue
to do the same or, or,

should I do the opposite? Should
I pursue a woman who is simple
