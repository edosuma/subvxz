00:47.806 --> 00:49.807
(INDISTINCT SPEAKING)

00:56.626 --> 00:59.717
Mrs. Quigley, age 46,

00:59.746 --> 01:01.127
been suffering for several days

01:01.133 --> 01:03.389
since experiencing a
blow to the stomach.

01:03.424 --> 01:05.291
Will you describe your symptoms, ma'am?

01:05.313 --> 01:07.171
I've explained it already.

01:07.723 --> 01:09.119
It hurts here.

01:10.123 --> 01:13.886
The patient reports abdominal
radiating to the left shoulder.

01:13.904 --> 01:15.765
And she's been dizzy and tired.

01:17.161 --> 01:20.574
I get tired every time I come
to this godforsaken place.

01:20.652 --> 01:23.632
These symptoms are consistent
with a lacerated spleen, sir.

01:23.664 --> 01:24.931
Surgery is indicated.

01:24.935 --> 01:28.200
And how would you expose the spleen
to repair the damage, Dr. Dixon?

01:28.223 --> 01:30.486
By partial excision of one or more ribs,

01:30.509 --> 01:33.990
followed by subpleural or
transpleural exposure of the spleen.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.603
Very well.

01:35.888 --> 01:37.204
Excuse me, Dr. Forbes?

01:37.215 --> 01:39.547
Would it be preferable
to do a vertical incision

01:39.558 --> 01:41.427
of the left linear semilunaris?

01:41.464 --> 01:42.782
Preferable how?

01:43.036 --> 01:45.715
A shorter, more comfortable
recovery time for the patient

01:45.733 --> 01:47.381
if the ribs are not excised.

01:49.982 --> 01:51.787
Very good, Dr. Ogden.

01:52.152 --> 01:53.765
The surgery is in one-half hour.

01:54.130 --> 01:56.160
Prepare to assist. The
rest of you may observe.

01:56.182 --> 01:57.531
Oh, uh...

02:01.599 --> 02:03.445
- George.
- Sir.

02:03.946 --> 02:07.063
Sir! I wasn't expecting you in today.

02:07.089 --> 02:09.300
- Have we had a murder?
- No, no, no.

02:09.370 --> 02:12.001
I'm simply looking for my... aha!

02:12.303 --> 02:14.522
- Switch sequencer.
- Oh.

02:18.085 --> 02:20.210
It's a beautiful day outside, George.

02:20.254 --> 02:22.943
Why don't you go for a
walk along the boardwalk?

02:23.176 --> 02:24.234
The boardwalk, sir.

02:24.259 --> 02:27.052
The boardwalk is always teeming
with happy young couples.

02:27.351 --> 02:29.300
They always come out
when the sun shines.

02:29.425 --> 02:32.206
We have a call of a
pickpocket at Wilton and Yonge.

02:33.101 --> 02:34.999
Oh, then. Excellent.

02:35.677 --> 02:37.324
Prepped and ready, Doctor.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.202
Gauze.

02:44.262 --> 02:45.530
Very good.

02:48.485 --> 02:50.894
I believe the spleen is enlarged.

02:53.002 --> 02:54.454
More gauze.

02:55.684 --> 02:57.512
The patient is an inebrient.

02:58.171 --> 03:01.939
Enlarged spleens are a side
effect of chronic alcohol use.

03:02.199 --> 03:04.307
Can you see the laceration?

03:07.335 --> 03:09.016
Yes, there it is.

03:09.098 --> 03:13.262
Would you recommend repairing the
laceration or a complete splenectomy?

03:13.953 --> 03:16.269
Due to the enlargement, a splenectomy.

03:16.394 --> 03:17.747
I agree.

03:17.789 --> 03:20.534
Go ahead, bring the spleen
forward into the wound.

03:23.716 --> 03:25.591
There's an adhesion to the diaphragm.

03:25.614 --> 03:27.171
You'll need to separate that.

03:27.405 --> 03:28.732
Scissors.

03:34.825 --> 03:36.327
(EXHALING SHARPLY)

03:36.502 --> 03:37.989
I've gone through the diaphragm.

03:38.026 --> 03:39.979
- Heartbeat is erratic.
- She's bleeding.

03:41.140 --> 03:43.019
Can you see the injury?

03:45.515 --> 03:49.381
- The patient's pressure is falling.
- Do you want me to take over, Doctor?

03:49.454 --> 03:51.655
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

03:54.609 --> 03:58.276
No. There it is. I can do it. Sutures.

04:05.928 --> 04:07.879
Ah. There.

04:11.713 --> 04:13.527
Heartbeat is normal.

04:14.885 --> 04:17.285
Very good work under pressure, Doctor.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.350
Shall we continue?

04:20.624 --> 04:22.225
Scalpel.

04:22.714 --> 04:25.772
- Very well done, Dr. Ogden.
- Ah!

04:27.879 --> 04:29.629
Thank you.

04:30.614 --> 04:33.354
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

04:33.585 --> 04:37.301
The patient's son is looking for
news. Would you like to do the honour?

04:40.269 --> 04:42.176
Mr. Quigley.

04:42.219 --> 04:44.371
The surgery was quite successful.

04:44.394 --> 04:47.071
You can expect your mother to
have a comfortable recovery.

04:47.123 --> 04:49.783
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much.

04:49.806 --> 04:51.855
Dr. Forbes, there's an emergency.

04:51.878 --> 04:54.953
- It's Mrs. Quigley.
- Excuse me.

04:55.987 --> 04:58.322
(TENSE MUSIC)

04:59.011 --> 05:01.774
Mrs. Quigley. What happened?

05:06.005 --> 05:08.245
OK. Get her up. Get her up.

05:10.450 --> 05:12.200
She's bradycardic.

05:12.252 --> 05:13.973
She's likely bleeding internally.

05:13.985 --> 05:16.213
Get her back to the operating
theater, we'll re-open.

05:16.271 --> 05:18.042
She's still not breathing.

05:27.129 --> 05:28.793
She's gone.

05:40.393 --> 05:43.634
Is it too late to offer you
my congratulations, Doctor?

05:43.640 --> 05:45.479
(RISING MUSIC)

05:50.945 --> 05:52.604
You said it was a simple surgery.

05:52.621 --> 05:54.745
That it would be all right
for a student to assist!

05:54.767 --> 05:56.984
Unfortunately, there were complications.

05:56.995 --> 05:59.275
The spleen was enlarged,
there were growths...

05:59.281 --> 06:01.652
You told me it went well!
That she would be all right!

06:01.675 --> 06:03.061
I'm so sorry, Mr. Quigley.

06:03.075 --> 06:06.147
- Everything seemed to be fine...
- And minutes later, she's dead!

06:06.345 --> 06:07.818
I understand you're upset.

06:07.828 --> 06:10.583
We really did everything we
could do to help your mother.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.263
What happened, then?

06:12.341 --> 06:13.861
I don't know, sir.

06:14.068 --> 06:16.145
But I promise you, if
something went wrong here,

06:16.164 --> 06:17.928
I will find out what it is.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.755
(SOFT MUSIC)

06:25.753 --> 06:29.311
We do not speak to family
members like that, Dr. Ogden.

06:29.364 --> 06:32.689
- I beg your pardon?
- That man's mother died a natural death.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.762
You should not have suggested otherwise.

06:34.799 --> 06:36.701
Well... but surely,

06:36.733 --> 06:38.764
we need to establish how she died.

06:38.787 --> 06:40.068
Dr. Ogden.

06:40.091 --> 06:43.342
You need not feel responsible
for Mrs. Quigley's death.

06:43.807 --> 06:45.115
I saw your work.

06:45.134 --> 06:46.921
I judged it to be correct.

06:46.938 --> 06:49.905
- Well, I understand, but...
- The spleen was more diseased

06:49.919 --> 06:51.461
than I anticipated.

06:51.586 --> 06:53.732
It simply could not be repaired in time.

06:54.602 --> 06:56.191
Thank you.

06:56.794 --> 06:59.401
Right over here, by the desk.

07:04.822 --> 07:07.640
Mr. Geoffrey's men
usually wear a uniform.

07:07.681 --> 07:10.009
I'm new. I don't have my uniform yet.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.519
Don't you have something for me to sign?

07:20.554 --> 07:23.333
Sir. They told me you
wanted Saturday delivery.

07:23.366 --> 07:25.602
They didn't give me a uniform,
they didn't give me a paper.

07:25.626 --> 07:28.960
They said go to the crazy
new house on Lamport Avenue.

07:29.964 --> 07:32.323
Actually, it's a modern design.

07:33.553 --> 07:34.920
Do you want me to come back with this

07:34.934 --> 07:37.425
- after my uniform fitting?
- No, it... it's fine.

07:37.467 --> 07:38.941
It can stay.

07:44.645 --> 07:46.479
â™ª

07:53.048 --> 07:55.775
Nurse. Nurse, some help?

07:55.822 --> 07:57.474
Of course, Constable.

07:59.621 --> 08:01.035
What do we have here?

08:01.081 --> 08:03.867
Well, Mr. Zervos here

08:03.927 --> 08:05.663
fell and knocked his noggin on a fence

08:05.666 --> 08:09.376
- while trying to avoid arrest.
- I was running because I didn't do anything.

08:09.399 --> 08:11.739
We'll get the injury cleaned
up and a doctor can take a look.

08:11.758 --> 08:16.051
I go out in the morning only to
be harassed by the constabulary.

08:16.649 --> 08:18.511
It's the same story my whole life.

08:18.842 --> 08:20.789
Ever since my papa went off to sea

08:20.803 --> 08:22.526
and left me alone with my old uncle.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.088
Oh, I've heard this tale before.

08:24.101 --> 08:27.666
"A rough sailor's lad, made
orphan by a winter's shipwreck."

08:27.675 --> 08:30.199
"Play'd among the waste
and lumber of the shore."

08:30.844 --> 08:33.869
- Enoch Arden.
- One of my favourite poems.

08:33.994 --> 08:35.215
Huh.

08:37.102 --> 08:38.534
Nurse.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.570
You administered the
anaesthetic to Mrs. Quigley.

08:42.573 --> 08:43.759
Yes.

08:43.768 --> 08:46.706
Did you feel her response
to the gas was normal?

08:46.734 --> 08:50.280
Yes, her response was normal, Dr. Ogden.

08:51.012 --> 08:52.978
Until she died, that is.

08:53.192 --> 08:54.762
I'm sure you're aware

08:54.771 --> 08:56.867
that anaesthetics carry some risk.

08:57.429 --> 08:59.299
I'm aware that the
Lancet Medical Journal

08:59.322 --> 09:02.177
has shown that chloroform
is nine times more likely

09:02.182 --> 09:03.761
to cause death than ether.

09:03.996 --> 09:06.980
- We use ether, of course.
- Of course.

09:07.376 --> 09:10.729
- So you observed no adverse reaction?
- No, I didn't.

09:10.918 --> 09:14.491
In fact the splenectomy was not
Mrs. Quigley's first operation,

09:14.533 --> 09:16.224
as you may have noticed from her chart.

09:16.237 --> 09:18.981
- Yes, of course, I...
- Since I had previously given her ether,

09:19.019 --> 09:21.064
I knew that she tolerated it well.

09:21.267 --> 09:24.560
Indeed, her pressure, pulse,
and breathing were all normal

09:24.685 --> 09:26.816
until the tear in her diaphragm.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.312
You believe that tear caused her death?

09:30.386 --> 09:32.722
I don't believe it was the anaesthetic.

09:34.596 --> 09:38.037
If you're looking to blame a nurse,
I suggest you tread carefully.

09:38.291 --> 09:41.260
You'll find that sort of thing
doesn't go over well around here.

09:41.474 --> 09:43.295
â™ª

09:48.766 --> 09:50.044
Matron!

09:53.463 --> 09:55.908
Will there be a
post-mortem on Mrs. Quigley?

09:55.942 --> 09:57.634
Oh, I don't think so. Dr. Forbes

09:57.645 --> 09:59.447
has already signed
the death certificate.

09:59.531 --> 10:00.814
Oh, I see.

10:01.856 --> 10:04.284
If I may speak intimately, Doctor?

10:04.451 --> 10:06.995
- Of course.
- You mustn't be hard on yourself.

10:07.172 --> 10:10.160
I know Dr. Forbes thinks
very highly of your work.

10:10.323 --> 10:11.542
Thank you, Matron.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.005
That's very kind of you.

10:13.093 --> 10:15.466
It's never easy to lose a patient.

10:15.540 --> 10:19.398
No matter the circumstances. Try
not to take it too much to heart.

10:22.216 --> 10:25.805
Matron, I'd like Mrs. Quigley's
remains sent to the City Morgue.

10:26.155 --> 10:28.108
That's not how we normally do things.

10:28.178 --> 10:31.491
Yes, I understand, but I
am still the City Coroner.

10:31.498 --> 10:34.202
It's well within my purview
to order a post-mortem.

10:35.233 --> 10:36.593
Very well, Doctor.

10:37.544 --> 10:40.838
Well, thank you for allowing me
to escort you home, Nurse Graham.

10:40.878 --> 10:42.789
I'm pleased to have
the company, Constable.

10:42.914 --> 10:45.022
It must be worrisome at times,

10:45.080 --> 10:46.698
a young lady out alone.

10:46.767 --> 10:49.565
This young lady is well
able to take care of herself.

10:49.594 --> 10:51.781
- Now, I meant no offense.
- None taken.

10:52.741 --> 10:55.787
I very much think nursing
is an admirable calling.

10:55.810 --> 10:57.572
What made you decide to go into it?

10:57.595 --> 10:59.781
I was destined to be a nurse.

10:59.818 --> 11:01.568
"Destined". How so?

11:01.693 --> 11:04.743
My name is Florence Nightingale Graham.

11:05.034 --> 11:06.358
(CHUCKLING)

11:06.393 --> 11:08.241
- Florence Nightingale?
- Mm-hmm.

11:08.270 --> 11:10.451
Well, that is quite
the name to live up to.

11:10.483 --> 11:12.099
I do what I can.

11:12.118 --> 11:14.472
Although my supervisor
says that my hobbies

11:14.490 --> 11:16.098
take up too much of my time.

11:16.223 --> 11:17.847
So what, they expect you

11:17.861 --> 11:19.528
to have no interests
outside of your training?

11:19.542 --> 11:23.229
We're to devote ourselves night
and day to developing good character

11:23.246 --> 11:25.364
and an orderly habit of mind.

11:25.398 --> 11:27.460
Well in that case, what sort of...

11:27.714 --> 11:29.896
hobbies might distract a young lady

11:29.907 --> 11:32.026
from such noble pursuits?

11:32.319 --> 11:35.071
Terribly frivolous things, to be sure.

11:38.607 --> 11:42.107
Perhaps I will show you
one day, Constable Crabtree.

11:44.017 --> 11:46.285

11:55.808 --> 11:57.563
(DOOR CLOSING)

11:59.766 --> 12:01.667
(SIGHING)

12:02.389 --> 12:05.671
Well, I completed my final
supervised surgery today.

12:05.925 --> 12:10.267
- Oh, that's wonderful, Julia! Congratulations.
- Then the patient died.

12:10.624 --> 12:13.163
Oh... Oh, I'm sorry.

12:13.215 --> 12:15.648
There were complications,
but they were minor.

12:15.892 --> 12:18.250
And the procedure was
completed perfectly.

12:18.517 --> 12:20.354
Dr. Forbes has put the death down

12:20.371 --> 12:22.772
to the poor state of
the patient's spleen.

12:23.411 --> 12:26.458
But she was stable when she
left the operating theater.

12:26.493 --> 12:29.361
Monitored by nurses, and see here?

12:31.143 --> 12:33.681
- What am I looking for?
- Her temperature, pulse,

12:33.682 --> 12:37.305
and respiration were taken every
five minutes and they were all normal.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.988
- All normal, you say.
- Exactly!

12:39.994 --> 12:43.017
And then she seems to have
simply... stopped breathing.

12:43.043 --> 12:45.144
Doesn't that strike you as strange?

12:46.063 --> 12:48.213
What does Dr. Forbes say?

12:48.913 --> 12:53.097
That I must temper my ego to the
possibility I will lose patients.

12:53.822 --> 12:57.725
- Well, I suppose that's true.
- Well, of course it's true...

12:58.089 --> 12:59.724
it's simply not...

12:59.925 --> 13:01.860
the problem at hand.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.298
What bothers me is not
knowing what went wrong.

13:06.632 --> 13:09.148
Dr. Forbes seems to think
that nothing's amiss.

13:09.273 --> 13:12.471
Well, you did all you could by
raising your concerns to him.

13:12.505 --> 13:15.354
Yes. Yes.

13:17.093 --> 13:19.436
And then I ordered a post-mortem.

13:20.680 --> 13:23.282
With Dr. Forbes' agreement?

13:23.748 --> 13:25.544
Not precisely.

13:25.806 --> 13:29.462
But hopefully Miss Hart will find
something that will catch his attention.

13:31.408 --> 13:33.043
If you don't suspect murder

13:33.060 --> 13:35.156
and she doesn't think she
made a mistake in the surgery,

13:35.179 --> 13:36.740
what exactly are we looking for?

13:36.763 --> 13:39.131
Perhaps this one is for peace of mind.

13:39.165 --> 13:40.793
My first thought, of course,

13:40.816 --> 13:43.648
was internal bleeding due
to the tear in the diaphragm,

13:43.670 --> 13:45.766
but her blood pressure
returned to normal.

13:45.795 --> 13:48.179
There doesn't appear to be
excess blood in the abdomen.

13:48.208 --> 13:50.281
- It would have dissipated by now.
- Ah.

13:50.322 --> 13:52.178
Excuse me, Doctor.

13:56.507 --> 13:59.386
The sutures on the
diaphragm are still intact.

13:59.423 --> 14:01.012
That's not your cause of death.

14:01.067 --> 14:02.624
Oh. Well, that's good news.

14:02.661 --> 14:04.149
I also considered the possibility

14:04.154 --> 14:06.351
of an adverse reaction
to the anaesthetic.

14:06.476 --> 14:09.403
I will certainly check the
liver for ether concentrations.

14:09.404 --> 14:12.918
Check as well for any type of
poison or allergic reaction.

14:13.144 --> 14:16.101
That... might not be necessary.

14:16.345 --> 14:17.809
Why do you say that?

14:18.136 --> 14:22.207
The sutures tying off the
splenic artery came loose.

14:22.382 --> 14:23.796
(JULIA): No!

14:24.147 --> 14:25.524
There,

14:25.703 --> 14:27.472
below the left costal arch.

14:28.457 --> 14:30.539
That must be a common occurrence,

14:30.718 --> 14:33.896
- sutures coming loose?
- I'm sure it happens.

14:34.311 --> 14:37.723
Sometimes the tissue is too
damaged to hold the sutures.

14:38.130 --> 14:40.833
But in this case, I
felt quite confident.

14:42.386 --> 14:44.536
So there was internal bleeding?

14:45.416 --> 14:46.812
Yes...

14:46.937 --> 14:49.091
Causing the heart to slow and stop.

14:51.343 --> 14:52.831
We know the cause of death.

14:52.845 --> 14:54.144
Yes.

14:55.281 --> 14:56.785
It was me.

14:56.910 --> 15:00.079
(MELANCHOLIC MUSIC)

15:04.769 --> 15:06.400
Dr. Forbes?

15:06.853 --> 15:10.033
I observed Mrs. Quigley's
post-mortem today.

15:10.084 --> 15:11.424
I beg your pardon?

15:11.650 --> 15:13.370
I didn't order a post-mortem.

15:13.372 --> 15:16.155
What made you believe you were
justified in going over my head?

15:16.233 --> 15:17.788
I'm sorry. I...

15:17.823 --> 15:19.780
I wanted to know what happened.

15:19.814 --> 15:22.149
Did the results put your mind at rest?

15:22.815 --> 15:25.878
It seems the cause of death
was a failure of my sutures.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.522
I trust this puts an
end to your inquiry?

15:29.263 --> 15:30.451
Yes.

15:30.479 --> 15:33.846
I lost a patient just last month
under similar circumstances.

15:33.862 --> 15:35.748
- You did?
- Yes.

15:35.771 --> 15:39.210
I'll admit I took it to
heart myself for a time.

15:40.833 --> 15:43.067
Take my advice, Dr. Ogden.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.672
Have a stiff drink

15:44.706 --> 15:46.740
and then you get back to work.

15:51.166 --> 15:54.013
So then, I looked into this
other patient, a Mr. Ross.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.626
He also died following routine surgery.

15:56.751 --> 15:58.549
People die in hospitals.

15:58.623 --> 16:01.865
Yes, but what if these two
cases are somehow related?

16:02.224 --> 16:05.593
The results of the post-mortem
showed a natural death.

16:05.627 --> 16:09.096
- One mistake with sutures...
- But I don't believe I made a mistake.

16:09.124 --> 16:11.756
Then how do you explain
Miss Hart's findings?

16:11.881 --> 16:13.558
Pardon?

16:20.266 --> 16:22.543
The post-mortem results
were quite clear.

16:23.835 --> 16:25.314
Yes.

16:25.366 --> 16:29.051
Miss Hart concluded
that the sutures failed,

16:29.086 --> 16:32.477
causing the heart to stop.
The obvious alternative...

16:32.602 --> 16:34.734
- (LOUD MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
- is that the...

16:34.859 --> 16:37.002
the heart failed first,

16:37.077 --> 16:41.028
and then the sutures were damaged
during the resuscitation efforts.

16:41.594 --> 16:43.430
How did the heart fail?

16:44.551 --> 16:47.644
Something must have
happened after the surgery.

16:48.088 --> 16:51.572
Are you saying someone deliberately
tried to kill Mrs. Quigley?

16:52.486 --> 16:55.638
It may have been human error.

17:05.298 --> 17:07.463
in order to leave murder behind.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.556
Yes. I did.

17:10.059 --> 17:12.292
But what if it's followed me?

17:17.221 --> 17:19.580
You were assigned to
sit with Mrs. Quigley

17:19.601 --> 17:21.435
following her surgery, is that correct?

17:21.560 --> 17:24.568
Yes, Nurse Sullivan
signed her over to me.

17:24.643 --> 17:27.117
Very good. And I
understand you're instructed

17:27.135 --> 17:28.649
not to leave the patient.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.603
No. I am to stay at the bedside

17:31.620 --> 17:34.181
and watch for any signs of trouble.

17:34.215 --> 17:37.101
And you did that for Mrs. Quigley?
You were with her constantly.

17:37.147 --> 17:38.919
Yes.

17:39.330 --> 17:41.978
Tell me about when
she went into distress.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.832
It came on suddenly.

17:43.849 --> 17:46.077
Her pulse was weak and...

17:46.118 --> 17:49.330
her breathing irregular. I
called for the Matron immediately.

17:49.364 --> 17:51.899
The anaesthetic nurse also responded?

17:51.933 --> 17:53.741
Nurse Sullivan? Yes.

17:53.752 --> 17:56.880
And the handsome resident
came over as well.

17:56.913 --> 17:59.423
- Dr. Dixon?
- Yes.

17:59.751 --> 18:01.231
So,

in the time before you
noticed Mrs. Quigley failing,

18:03.948 --> 18:06.487
no one but yourself came to her bedside?

18:06.516 --> 18:09.055
No. No one at all.

would you like to hear first?

All right, personal news it
is! It is the weekend after all.

Very good, George.

Yes, well I'm glad you
think so, sir, because

I didn't want it to seem like
I didn't care for Miss Bloom.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.460
I got quite the opposite impression.

19:00.479 --> 19:03.491
Right, and I mean, life carries
on, after all, does it not?

And this young woman,
sir, she's a nurse.

I mean, could you think
of a better possible match

19:07.935 --> 19:10.027
than a constable and a nurse?

19:10.091 --> 19:12.187
It's early days with
this young woman, but

19:12.213 --> 19:15.748
I know that she... is clever,

19:15.812 --> 19:18.519
that her name is Miss Graham.

19:37.368 --> 19:39.813
Dr. Ogden lost a patient yesterday,

19:39.938 --> 19:41.978
and afterward,

19:42.103 --> 19:44.083
called for all manner
of tests to be done

19:44.097 --> 19:45.847
concerning the cause of death. I mean,

19:45.972 --> 19:49.348
anaesthetic overdose, all
kinds of poisons and whatnot.

19:49.403 --> 19:51.287
They all came back negative.

19:51.453 --> 19:53.687
In fact, the only thing out
of the ordinary was some damage

19:53.696 --> 19:55.699
to the vein where the
injections had been made.

Yes.

- So...

20:00.261 --> 20:02.198
pardon me for saying, sir, but...

20:02.461 --> 20:05.369
is it not possible that
Doctor Ogden simply...

20:05.997 --> 20:08.663
made a mistake and
doesn't want to admit it?

As a matter of fact,
I looked into the one

21:21.334 --> 21:24.687
you mentioned to me earlier,
Mr. Ross. It's also curious.

21:24.729 --> 21:26.562
I did not tell you about
that patient, Doctor,

we all must deal with failure.

21:32.353 --> 21:35.050
Yes. But what if I didn't fail?

21:36.603 --> 21:39.361
I have seen arrogance in
this profession before.

21:42.995 --> 21:44.331
Be that as it may,

precisely why I'm investigating.

responsibility to do so.

21:57.954 --> 21:59.045

As head surgeon of this hospital,

22:00.783 --> 22:03.551
it is my responsibility to
ask you: are you a coroner

22:03.585 --> 22:05.214
or are you a surgeon?

22:07.799 --> 22:10.461
So, you came up with
this concoction yourself?

22:10.497 --> 22:12.981
I've been mixing it up
in my father's kitchen.

22:13.031 --> 22:14.904
He's fed up with the smells and mess

22:14.929 --> 22:18.167
but I think I've finally
struck on a good formula.

22:18.784 --> 22:21.095
I believe I can feel it working.

22:21.220 --> 22:23.386
There's a... a... a...

22:24.377 --> 22:26.265
There's a mild tingle!

22:26.288 --> 22:28.719
It's based on a treatment one
of the doctors at the hospital

22:28.743 --> 22:30.173
is using for burn victims.

22:30.209 --> 22:33.389
It occurred to me that if his
remedy could heal damaged skin,

22:33.419 --> 22:36.383
it might also help skin
ravaged by age and worry.

22:36.417 --> 22:38.318
Well, that's very enterprising of you.

See, anybody who cares so much

22:43.341 --> 22:45.929
for others will surely
be a good nurse indeed.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.999
Was it something I said, Miss Graham?

You and everyone else I know
want me to be a good nurse.

22:56.711 --> 22:58.203
But the truth is...

22:58.576 --> 23:01.657
- I'm not sure I'm good at all.
- Whatever gave you that idea?

23:02.122 --> 23:05.231
A patient in my care
died suddenly yesterday.

23:06.244 --> 23:08.699
I was supposed to be watching over them.

23:09.453 --> 23:12.384
I'm afraid Dr. Ogden
thinks I'm responsible.

23:13.165 --> 23:14.821

Will you put the kettle
on? We have work to do.

23:27.296 --> 23:30.418
- But I was going to...
- I have the chart for every patient

23:30.437 --> 23:33.044
who died following
surgery in the past year.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.407
Something is going on in that ward,

23:35.434 --> 23:37.074
and we are going to find out what.

23:39.017 --> 23:40.391
All right.

23:46.152 --> 23:47.702
So, out of all the patients

23:47.719 --> 23:50.201
who died following
surgery in the past year,

23:50.352 --> 23:52.135
four had symptoms in common

23:52.152 --> 23:54.604
with Mrs. Quigley and Mr. Ross.

23:54.794 --> 23:57.759
It's not a great number but I
wonder if it could be something.

23:57.884 --> 24:00.580
Does Miss Hart's report of irritation

24:00.586 --> 24:03.108
at the injection site
suggest anything to you?

24:03.154 --> 24:06.488
None of her medications were
likely to cause that reaction.

24:06.730 --> 24:10.230
So in all likelihood, we're
looking for some sort of poison.

24:10.264 --> 24:11.784
I believe so.

24:11.909 --> 24:14.582
And if she was poisoned, it
had to be between the time

24:14.594 --> 24:17.138
she left the operating
theatre and the time she died.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.405
There is one nurse

24:19.440 --> 24:21.564
who signed five of six charts

24:21.575 --> 24:24.788
on the days that they
died. A Nurse... Sullivan.

24:25.139 --> 24:27.649
She has been rather
argumentative with me.

24:27.718 --> 24:29.174
But she didn't have opportunity

24:29.191 --> 24:31.414
to harm Mrs. Quigley
following her surgery.

24:31.437 --> 24:33.803
Nurse Graham was with
her the entire time.

24:33.861 --> 24:35.468
(DOORBELL RINGING)

24:36.291 --> 24:38.818
Nurse Graham signed three charts.

24:38.830 --> 24:41.150
- (DOORBELL RINGING AND KNOCKING)
- So perhaps...

24:41.179 --> 24:42.992
she was left alone with three of them,

24:43.015 --> 24:45.807
- and then had access to the others as well?
- (DOORBELL RINGING)

24:45.841 --> 24:47.914
Nurse Graham, Nurse Graham...

24:47.949 --> 24:50.626
- Why does that sound familiar?
- Nurse Graham!

24:50.751 --> 24:53.401
- Constable Crabtree!
- Oh...

24:54.783 --> 24:56.193
George.

24:56.256 --> 24:58.927
- William, this is Nurse Graham.
- How do you do?

24:59.052 --> 25:01.928
Sir, Doctor. Nurse Graham and I were

25:01.942 --> 25:04.724
discussing a patient that died recently.

25:04.903 --> 25:07.413
Constable Crabtree urged
me to speak with you.

25:07.795 --> 25:10.540
You have information
on Mrs. Quigley's death?

25:10.559 --> 25:11.890
Yes.

25:12.350 --> 25:15.234
As you know, I'm not meant
to leave the patient's side

25:15.248 --> 25:16.413
until they wake up.

25:16.427 --> 25:18.251
But as I was sitting with Mrs. Quigley,

25:18.260 --> 25:21.509
I realised that I had forgotten
to prepare her mouthwash.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.860
People's mouths are exceptionally dry

25:23.870 --> 25:25.261
when they wake up after an operation,

25:25.275 --> 25:26.472
but they're not meant to have water,

25:26.491 --> 25:29.304
so we swab their mouths
with this preparation.

25:29.355 --> 25:32.115
So, you left the patient
to fetch the mouthwash.

25:32.142 --> 25:34.049
Approximately how long do you think

25:34.067 --> 25:36.306
you were away from
Mrs. Quigley's bedside?

25:36.844 --> 25:39.074
Three minutes. It couldn't
have been more than that.

25:39.129 --> 25:40.732
By the time she returned,

25:40.857 --> 25:42.864
Mrs. Quigley had stopped breathing.

25:42.896 --> 25:44.683
And that's when I raised the alarm.

25:45.314 --> 25:47.801
Thank you for telling us
the truth, Nurse Graham.

25:47.875 --> 25:51.559
- Yes, thank you, George.
- Sir. Doctor.

25:54.852 --> 25:56.547
You know what this means.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.076
It means your Nurse Sullivan

25:59.085 --> 26:01.171
had opportunity to kill them all.

26:16.064 --> 26:17.563
You're the Coroner?

26:18.125 --> 26:19.783
What is your inquiry, sir?

26:20.745 --> 26:24.532
I was told my mother was
brought here. Edith Quigley?

26:24.559 --> 26:25.927
I'd like to make arrangements,

26:25.932 --> 26:27.894
and I don't know when
she'll be released.

26:28.258 --> 26:30.432
The post-mortem for
Mrs. Quigley is complete.

26:30.460 --> 26:33.251
I'm afraid her remains have not
yet been approved for release.

26:33.260 --> 26:35.447
But you've discovered why she died?

26:35.696 --> 26:38.215
You understand, I'm not at
liberty to share the results.

26:38.247 --> 26:40.435
The case is still under
police investigation.

26:40.513 --> 26:41.876
Police?

26:42.572 --> 26:46.026
What if the nursing superintendent
finds out and I'm dismissed?

26:46.151 --> 26:47.915
My father will be very disappointed.

26:47.951 --> 26:49.619
I'm meant to help support the family.

26:49.744 --> 26:51.697
Don't worry about that now.

You're quite right, Constable.

27:06.841 --> 27:08.471
Maybe it's my cream,

27:08.771 --> 27:10.825
maybe it's your natural magnetism.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.050
You think I have natural magnetism?

27:13.175 --> 27:16.054
Well, you certainly have
something, Mr. Crabtree.

27:16.390 --> 27:17.716
But I am sure you have had more

27:17.725 --> 27:19.489
than your share of ladies tell you that.

27:20.051 --> 27:22.262
I wouldn't say there were that many.

- Do you have any extra jars?
- I do.

You leave them with me
and we'll see what happens.

That would be wonderful.

28:17.349 --> 28:18.868
(MURDOCH): Nurse Sullivan.

28:19.315 --> 28:22.699
We'd like to speak to you about
the deaths of several patients.

28:22.824 --> 28:26.288
We've identified six
post-operative deaths of interest.

28:26.316 --> 28:28.600
I thought since you worked
closely with each patient,

28:28.610 --> 28:29.849
you may have insights.

28:29.872 --> 28:32.142
You say insights, and yet
you're here with a Detective.

28:32.326 --> 28:34.532
What you mean is you suspect me.

28:34.900 --> 28:37.138
You cared for each
of these five patients

28:37.151 --> 28:38.962
on the days that they died.

28:39.975 --> 28:42.481
I am the best anaesthetic
nurse in the department.

28:42.508 --> 28:44.687
Dr. Forbes often requests me.

28:44.954 --> 28:47.616
We believe Mrs. Quigley
may have been poisoned

28:47.639 --> 28:49.413
sometime after her surgery.

28:49.707 --> 28:51.835
- What kind of poison?
- We don't know yet.

28:51.960 --> 28:54.575
No one would want to do such a thing.

28:54.617 --> 28:57.030
Besides, no one would
have the opportunity.

28:57.155 --> 28:58.959
Nurse Graham was monitoring the patient.

28:58.982 --> 29:01.249
Actually, she stepped
away for several minutes

29:01.263 --> 29:03.941
and came back to find that
Mrs. Quigley wasn't breathing.

29:04.506 --> 29:07.241
When you monitor the
patients after a surgery,

29:07.255 --> 29:10.153
do you ever have cause
to leave them alone?

29:10.167 --> 29:11.515
Absolutely not.

29:11.728 --> 29:14.878
Not until they come out of anaesthetic
and are resting comfortably.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.264
Meaning that in each
of these five cases,

29:17.278 --> 29:19.332
you were the only
person with opportunity

29:19.350 --> 29:21.257
to have harmed the victims.

29:22.722 --> 29:24.223
If you say so.

29:30.826 --> 29:32.458
I happen to know that Dr. Forbes

29:32.472 --> 29:35.517
specifically asked you to
stop investigating this case.

29:35.731 --> 29:38.059
Yes. And if I had obeyed him,

29:38.068 --> 29:39.943
I wouldn't have discovered this pattern.

29:40.030 --> 29:41.739
I don't believe there is a pattern.

29:41.864 --> 29:45.267
Six deaths in a department
that loses 100 patients a year

29:45.290 --> 29:47.215
is not statistically relevant.

29:47.270 --> 29:48.620
Well, perhaps you're right.

29:48.689 --> 29:51.213
But even one unexplained
death is enough for me.

29:51.338 --> 29:54.893
Are you not concerned you will
be discharged from the hospital?

29:55.888 --> 29:58.458
If staying here means I
must say and do nothing

29:58.462 --> 30:00.700
when I think that
something is gravely wrong,

30:00.765 --> 30:03.118
then it's best I leave
sooner rather than later.

30:06.449 --> 30:08.806
I think you might be
looking for the wrong thing.

30:08.931 --> 30:10.358
What do you mean?

30:10.837 --> 30:14.300
What about patients who died
before they went to surgery?

30:14.830 --> 30:17.556
A pattern that Mrs.
Quigley's death doesn't fit?

30:17.574 --> 30:19.279
What if she is an anomaly?

30:20.522 --> 30:21.983
I didn't really think about it,

30:21.997 --> 30:25.598
but there have been a couple of
cases that struck me as strange.

30:25.603 --> 30:27.206
And what was odd about them?

30:27.261 --> 30:30.614
One of them, a Mr. Fox,
Mr. Fox died very suddenly.

30:30.684 --> 30:32.665
But the doctors didn't
think anything was amiss,

30:32.688 --> 30:35.764
so I assumed there must
have been an explanation.

30:36.257 --> 30:38.745
Where might we find the
charts for these patients?

30:38.768 --> 30:40.923
I suppose you want other charts as well?

30:41.255 --> 30:42.999
You're looking at any sudden deaths?

30:43.022 --> 30:44.902
(JULIA): Any cause of death identified

30:44.916 --> 30:47.366
as asphyxiation or heart failure.

30:51.811 --> 30:55.931
Mr. Ducharme has agreed to
stock your creams, Miss Graham.

30:55.960 --> 30:57.853
I can't believe it!

30:57.922 --> 31:00.611
He said the texture and the scent

31:00.628 --> 31:02.695
were nothing short of luxurious

31:02.735 --> 31:04.888
and it fills a gap in his product line.

31:04.935 --> 31:07.755
In fact, he would like to speak
with you about supplying more.

31:07.767 --> 31:09.834
How thrilling!

31:09.959 --> 31:12.419
Oh my goodness, though...
it's all in jam jars.

31:12.447 --> 31:16.685
Yes, and Mr. Ducharme
mentioned the labels.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.815
I think you should call it...

31:19.506 --> 31:23.461
Florence Nightingale Graham's

31:23.538 --> 31:27.441
Skin Cream For Your Face.

31:27.974 --> 31:31.229
I don't want to be associated
with hospitals and illness.

31:31.263 --> 31:35.269
I want it to sound
beautiful and... elegant.

31:35.304 --> 31:36.922
Right, right, right.

31:37.047 --> 31:39.496
Perhaps I'll change my name altogether.

31:39.855 --> 31:42.570
- Like an author with a nom de plume.
- Exactly!

31:42.604 --> 31:46.225
- What should it be?
- Well, if it's elegance you're after,

31:46.261 --> 31:48.389
I've always thought the
name Elizabeth was very fine.

31:48.403 --> 31:49.586
I agree.

31:49.614 --> 31:51.567
And for the surname...

31:54.916 --> 31:57.974
...Arden, after our favourite poem.

31:59.287 --> 32:01.097
Elizabeth Arden...

32:01.276 --> 32:03.110
I love it!

32:05.569 --> 32:07.453
Nurse Sullivan was right!

32:07.485 --> 32:10.530
I'm sure this many pre-operative
deaths is significant.

32:10.553 --> 32:13.527
Although it may not be so
easy to convince Dr. Forbes.

32:13.528 --> 32:15.167
We need to find a pattern.

32:15.605 --> 32:17.079
Dr. Ogden.

32:17.581 --> 32:19.824
This is your husband
the detective, I presume.

32:19.857 --> 32:22.104
- Dr. Forbes, Detective Murdoch.
- Doctor.

32:22.169 --> 32:25.871
Martin Quigley...
he's gone to the Board!

32:26.369 --> 32:29.312
He's threatening to sue the
hospital and me personally

32:29.317 --> 32:30.676
for his mother's death.

32:30.801 --> 32:33.476
Sir, I should hope it won't come
to that. I will speak to him.

32:33.490 --> 32:36.225
You have said quite enough!

32:38.514 --> 32:40.421
I have been instructed by the Board

32:40.444 --> 32:43.060
- to dismiss you, effective immediately.
- Sir!

32:43.093 --> 32:46.045
I could think of no argument
to make in your defense.

32:46.063 --> 32:47.394
Dr. Forbes,

32:47.638 --> 32:51.686
we believe we may have found evidence
of wrongdoing in this hospital.

32:51.993 --> 32:53.937
I beg your pardon, Detective,

32:54.062 --> 32:56.426
there is no crime here.

32:56.440 --> 32:58.420
- That's not necessarily...
- I'm afraid

32:58.443 --> 33:01.561
you are being unduly
swayed by your wife.

33:01.625 --> 33:04.381
We are doing nothing more
than seeking the truth.

33:04.876 --> 33:07.004
Collect your things tonight, Doctor,

33:07.022 --> 33:09.553
and don't come back. You're fired.

33:09.678 --> 33:12.646
â™ª

33:20.057 --> 33:21.801
To dismiss you without inquiring

33:21.820 --> 33:24.296
as to the investigation
is unconscionable.

33:24.701 --> 33:27.824
Dr. Forbes is convinced
I am indulging my own ego.

33:28.529 --> 33:30.131
Then let's prove him wrong.

33:30.449 --> 33:32.527
I did notice something last night.

33:33.674 --> 33:36.023
The deaths that Nurse
Sullivan found peculiar

33:36.041 --> 33:39.947
were all patients admitted for
conditions related to alcoholism.

33:40.633 --> 33:43.037
And half of these other patients

33:43.111 --> 33:46.523
were also admitted for conditions
related to the abuse of alcohol.

33:47.011 --> 33:51.071
Isn't it natural for inebrients to
get sick and die at a higher rate?

33:51.105 --> 33:52.229
Yes.

33:52.634 --> 33:54.586
But in all likelihood, they would die

33:54.596 --> 33:56.643
of the condition that
brought them to the hospital:

33:56.678 --> 34:00.766
spleen laceration, liver disease,
gastric ulcers. But look, William.

34:00.795 --> 34:04.167
The cause of death in all of these
patients is strangely similar.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.617
So no matter what
ailment brought them in,

34:06.658 --> 34:08.547
they all died of the same thing.

34:09.620 --> 34:11.199
They were murdered.

34:17.708 --> 34:18.993
George.

34:19.467 --> 34:20.757
Flo!

34:21.079 --> 34:23.780
What a lovely surprise. I
expected you to be at the hospital.

34:23.802 --> 34:26.257
I've just come from there.
I turned in my uniform.

34:26.525 --> 34:28.041
Oh no.

34:28.076 --> 34:30.536
- You've been dismissed after all?
- Not at all.

34:30.583 --> 34:33.185
- I withdrew.
- You withdrew?

34:33.248 --> 34:35.087
- Why?
- It's incredible.

34:35.110 --> 34:37.679
I checked in with Mr.
Ducharme and he's already sold

34:37.688 --> 34:40.462
half the creams you gave him.
In less than a day, George!

34:40.531 --> 34:43.387
That's wonderful! But
it's only been a day.

34:43.418 --> 34:46.333
I mean, is it not premature
to leave your profession?

34:46.574 --> 34:49.734
I think of it not as leaving one
profession but starting another.

34:49.812 --> 34:51.760
Mr. Ducharme and I had a heart-to-heart.

34:51.768 --> 34:55.068
He is a kindred spirit with a
true passion for feminine beauty.

34:55.103 --> 34:56.871
I have noticed that about him.

34:56.914 --> 34:59.009
He has a dear friend in New York City

34:59.032 --> 35:02.794
who has a place for a bookkeeper
at a real cosmetics company!

35:03.720 --> 35:05.115
New York City?

35:05.189 --> 35:07.348
I'm going to pursue my dreams!

35:07.358 --> 35:10.310
I'll get to see a cosmetics
business from the inside

35:10.347 --> 35:12.567
and meet all the best people.

35:12.692 --> 35:14.999
And it's all thanks
to your encouragement!

35:15.183 --> 35:16.486
That's wonderful.

35:16.942 --> 35:19.153
I can't thank you enough, George.

35:19.715 --> 35:22.018
Will you see me off
at the train next week?

35:23.313 --> 35:24.842
Union Station.

35:25.188 --> 35:26.708
I know it well.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.503
And yes, of course.

35:29.992 --> 35:31.428
Of course I will.

35:34.876 --> 35:36.389
(TENSE MUSIC)

35:36.453 --> 35:38.088
(MURDOCH): This way, gentlemen.

35:41.216 --> 35:42.962
What is this?

35:45.370 --> 35:47.899
I'm seizing staff records, Dr. Forbes.

35:47.977 --> 35:51.169
I have a reasonable suspicion
of foul play in this hospital.

35:51.220 --> 35:52.606
Multiple counts.

35:52.855 --> 35:56.576
I intend to find out who had
opportunity to commit these crimes.

36:05.912 --> 36:07.709
So, seven members of the attending staff

36:07.742 --> 36:10.214
were present at each of
these suspicious deaths.

36:10.426 --> 36:12.591
So, we interview them all,

36:12.646 --> 36:15.943
find out who among them has a
particular resentment toward alcoholics.

36:16.118 --> 36:17.441
We could search their homes;

36:17.459 --> 36:19.486
see if we can find something suspicious.

36:19.781 --> 36:22.609
Or... we could find the next victim.

36:23.124 --> 36:25.142
(KNOCKING)

36:25.837 --> 36:28.366
I thought I was finished
with the two of you.

36:28.491 --> 36:30.052
Not quite yet.

36:30.471 --> 36:32.663
We believe we know
how Mrs. Quigley died.

36:33.538 --> 36:35.602
She died because she was ill.

36:36.103 --> 36:38.905
Please, Doctor Forbes.
There's more to it than that.

36:43.605 --> 36:45.154
Go on, then.

36:46.061 --> 36:48.746
Someone on the ward is killing patients

36:48.750 --> 36:51.574
who come in with ailments
related to alcoholism.

36:52.062 --> 36:54.890
Preposterous. What proof have you?

36:55.107 --> 37:00.353
These habitual inebrients all somehow
died of the same cause of death.

37:00.399 --> 37:02.990
We don't believe it to be
medical error after all.

37:03.323 --> 37:05.931
We also have a list of
all of the staff members

37:05.943 --> 37:07.518
who were on duty at
the time of their deaths

37:07.528 --> 37:09.950
who had opportunity
to kill the patients.

37:12.774 --> 37:14.441
Am I on this list?

37:16.182 --> 37:17.440
You are.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.309
So, you can help vindicate yourself

37:20.314 --> 37:22.115
by assisting the investigation.

37:22.626 --> 37:24.320
And how would I do that?

37:24.445 --> 37:27.176
The next time someone with
this victim profile is admitted,

37:27.188 --> 37:29.523
we'd like to put a constable
on the ward undercover.

37:31.860 --> 37:35.651
Patients admitted with complaints
related to excessive alcohol use?

37:35.678 --> 37:37.046
Yes.

37:38.170 --> 37:40.767
Someone like that was
admitted yesterday.

37:42.053 --> 37:44.080
Surely, no one would
attempt to do this again,

37:44.094 --> 37:45.668
knowing that you have
been investigating.

37:45.692 --> 37:48.419
This person has been killing
with impunity for some time.

37:48.428 --> 37:51.011
And using a poison that
mimics natural causes.

37:51.045 --> 37:53.346
They may believe they are utterly safe.

37:56.984 --> 37:58.741
- (DRAMATIC MUSIC)
- What happened?

37:58.750 --> 38:00.039
He's bradycardic.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.166
- What did you give him?
- I didn't give him anything. I just arrived.

38:03.190 --> 38:06.009
- If you didn't interfere with him, then who did?
- Who is this?

38:06.059 --> 38:07.713
Can't you see we're
trying to save a man?

38:07.732 --> 38:09.993
We need to know what the
poison is to help him!

38:10.030 --> 38:12.673
- Poison?
- Yes. I believe this man was poisoned,

38:12.696 --> 38:15.074
as well as Mrs. Quigley
and countless others.

38:15.199 --> 38:18.016
- Well it wasn't me.
- Who else was in here with him?

38:18.048 --> 38:21.585
No one, only the Matron was here
when Nurse Sullivan and I arrived.

38:22.520 --> 38:23.844
Matron Ingram?

38:24.307 --> 38:26.232
- Pulse?
- It's fading.

38:26.646 --> 38:28.890
- He's not responsive.
- What did you give him?

38:28.954 --> 38:30.096
Nothing.

38:30.152 --> 38:32.132
This man is a drunk.
He's made himself sick.

38:32.150 --> 38:34.822
Tell us what the poison
is and how to stop this!

38:34.988 --> 38:37.724
Save this man's life and hope
the courts will have mercy on you.

38:37.758 --> 38:40.827
- I have need of no one's mercy.
- You may need it soon.

38:40.862 --> 38:43.048
Saving this man's life
may mean the difference

38:43.064 --> 38:45.963
between you living or
hanging by your neck.

38:46.014 --> 38:48.078
He was warned. He was
told to stop drinking.

38:48.102 --> 38:50.871
Are you willing to die... for him?

38:51.103 --> 38:54.249
And with far less dignity
than you afforded your victims?

38:54.374 --> 38:56.376
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

38:58.652 --> 39:02.162
- It was potassium chloride.
- We need calcium chloride. Right away.

39:02.185 --> 39:03.283
I'll get it.

39:03.317 --> 39:04.929
What about Crile's
chest compression method?

39:04.953 --> 39:08.287
- It's not accepted procedure.
- We have nothing to lose.

39:09.300 --> 39:10.390
Fine.

39:10.424 --> 39:11.994
Let's turn him.

39:14.292 --> 39:16.038
That's why we didn't find the poison.

39:16.066 --> 39:17.471
Elevated levels of potassium

39:17.480 --> 39:20.160
would only imitate
symptoms of heart failure.

39:20.234 --> 39:22.602
â™ª

39:27.374 --> 39:28.935
(GASPING)

39:30.003 --> 39:31.385
Yes.

39:31.625 --> 39:33.555
His heart rate is improving.

39:34.595 --> 39:36.583
How could you betray your oath?

39:36.617 --> 39:38.002
To this hospital?

39:38.127 --> 39:41.475
- To your colleagues?
- I did it for the hospital.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.556
These people didn't deserve our care.

39:43.591 --> 39:45.533
They're drunks and wastrels.

39:45.574 --> 39:47.698
They deserved better than your judgment.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.196
- Sir?
- Yes, George?

39:54.712 --> 39:57.839
I have some sad news, I'm afraid, sir.

39:59.272 --> 40:00.792
The seedling of my love

40:00.802 --> 40:03.712
has been cut out even before
it had a chance to bloom.

40:05.131 --> 40:07.540
Nurse Graham has decided
to quit nursing school

40:07.554 --> 40:11.036
and pursue her dreams in New York City.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.919
Ah yes, Nurse Graham.

40:14.356 --> 40:16.577
And I can no longer ignore a truth

40:16.586 --> 40:19.460
that has staring me
plainly in the face, sir:

40:19.842 --> 40:22.025
every woman I love

40:22.887 --> 40:24.314
leaves town.

40:27.197 --> 40:31.283
Sir, one or two failed relationships,
I mean, that could be bad luck.

40:31.301 --> 40:33.502
But at some point, a
man has to ask himself

40:33.537 --> 40:36.782
why love continually eludes him?

40:37.205 --> 40:38.741
George...

40:40.530 --> 40:45.358
...you do seem to choose
women who are ambitious.

40:45.727 --> 40:48.217
- What?
- Well...

40:48.251 --> 40:51.754
the women that you have loved,

40:51.788 --> 40:55.882
all seem to be women who
are willing to sacrifice

40:55.893 --> 41:00.462
everything they know in
order to pursue their goals.

41:02.899 --> 41:04.431
Sir, you're right. That's it!

41:04.924 --> 41:07.877
I continually set myself up for failure

41:08.185 --> 41:10.285
by pursuing ambitious women.

41:10.700 --> 41:12.528
Sir, you truly are a great detective.

41:12.551 --> 41:14.466
You've just solved the mystery
of my heart in an instant.

41:14.490 --> 41:16.521
- Well I...
- The question is, what do I do now?

41:16.541 --> 41:19.351
I mean, do I continue
to do the same or, or,

41:19.415 --> 41:23.786
should I do the opposite? Should
I pursue a woman who is simple

41:23.981 --> 41:28.324
or uncomplicated,
without worldly passions?

41:28.358 --> 41:32.842
I mean, is it time I resigned
myself to a life that is secure,

41:32.882 --> 41:37.033
even if a bit, you know, humdrum?

41:38.180 --> 41:41.306
That is a question only
you can answer, George.

41:42.158 --> 41:44.155
But I can tell you this:

41:44.979 --> 41:48.617
Although ambitious
women aren't always easy,

41:48.742 --> 41:51.580
they are always interesting.

41:54.904 --> 41:58.645
- Welcome back, Dr. Ogden.
- Thank you.

41:59.273 --> 42:01.052
Gentlemen.

42:02.496 --> 42:04.298
I must admit, I was quite impressed

42:04.327 --> 42:06.328
to see you catch the
killer in our midst.

42:06.596 --> 42:08.319
Thank you, Dr. Dixon.

42:08.444 --> 42:11.883
And I completed my twelfth
surgery while you were away.

42:11.966 --> 42:14.292
Oh? Second place suits you.

42:14.573 --> 42:15.895
For now.

42:17.116 --> 42:18.470
- Nurse Sullivan.
- Hmm.

42:18.493 --> 42:21.109
You'll be administering anaesthetic
in the operating theatre today?

42:21.133 --> 42:23.381
- I will.
- I'm glad to hear it.

42:23.427 --> 42:26.427
You just don't want to learn
someone else's name, do you?

42:26.709 --> 42:29.357
I have much more important things to do.

42:31.888 --> 42:33.582
Hello, Mr. Kerrigan.

42:33.669 --> 42:36.870
I'm Dr. Julia Ogden. I'll
be your surgeon today.

42:40.103 --> 42:41.641
Julia?

42:42.198 --> 42:43.621
I'm home.
