00:00.001 --> 00:01.866
<i>Previously on "Awkward"...</i>

00:01.891 --> 00:03.554
I can offer you a couple
shifts at the country club.

00:03.578 --> 00:04.226
I'm in.

00:04.250 --> 00:06.844
I'm sorry about how
everything went down.

00:06.869 --> 00:09.523
How about a secret party
tonight at the 16th tee?

00:09.548 --> 00:12.115
<i>I felt guilty about not
inviting Jake to the party.</i>

00:12.140 --> 00:13.107
What's going on out here?

00:13.109 --> 00:14.842
- Great party.
- You're fired.

00:15.891 --> 00:18.155
<i>Against all odds, my
friendship with Matty</i>

00:18.180 --> 00:19.779
<i>was stronger than ever.</i>

00:19.781 --> 00:21.448
<i>He'd even admitted to
me that I was right</i>

00:21.450 --> 00:22.959
<i>to tell him not to
transfer to Wycoff.</i>

00:22.984 --> 00:25.452
<i>It felt great, or at
least it would have</i>

00:25.477 --> 00:28.170
<i>if I didn't feel so bad
about getting Jake fired.</i>

00:28.195 --> 00:29.710
<i>And if I wasn't so
worried about work.</i>

00:29.734 --> 00:30.833
<i>And if I didn't have a hangover</i>

00:30.835 --> 00:32.414
<i>the size of a small country.</i>

00:32.439 --> 00:33.843
I feel awful.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.674
This is the worst thing
we've ever done to Jake.

00:36.676 --> 00:37.942
[clears throat]

00:37.944 --> 00:39.777
Okay, this is the second-worst thing

00:39.779 --> 00:41.011
we've ever done to Jake.

00:41.013 --> 00:42.179
I keep trying to reach him,

00:42.181 --> 00:43.912
but he's straight-up icing me.

00:44.350 --> 00:45.883
<i>You've reached Jake Rosati,</i>

00:45.885 --> 00:47.351
<i>Palos Hills Country Club manager.</i>

00:47.353 --> 00:48.686
<i>- Leave a message.</i>
- Jake.

00:48.688 --> 00:51.146
Again, we are all so, so sorry

00:51.171 --> 00:53.646
for getting you fired and
not inviting you to the party.

00:53.671 --> 00:54.992
We are jerks. Come on, guys.

00:54.994 --> 00:57.294
- Tell Jake what jerks we are.
- We're the biggest jerks.

00:57.296 --> 00:58.829
Jake, come get breakfast with us.

00:58.831 --> 01:00.331
Apologies, bitch.

01:00.333 --> 01:01.832
Everyone, please stop yelling.

01:01.834 --> 01:02.869
Just call me.

01:03.609 --> 01:05.302
That's like the eighth
message I've left.

01:05.304 --> 01:07.304
- He must be super pissed.
- We have to fix this.

01:07.306 --> 01:09.173
The only fix for this kind of hangover

01:09.175 --> 01:11.108
is hair of the dog.

01:12.148 --> 01:13.416
Oh, my God.

01:13.946 --> 01:15.045
That's it.

01:15.047 --> 01:16.747
Fix the negative effects of booze

01:16.749 --> 01:17.982
with more booze.

01:17.984 --> 01:19.516
Yeah, man. That's just science.

01:19.518 --> 01:21.652
No, no, no, Jake's mad at us

01:21.654 --> 01:23.454
for not inviting him to our party,

01:23.456 --> 01:25.256
so let's throw him a party.

01:25.258 --> 01:26.490
Put 'em up, Jenna.

01:26.492 --> 01:28.792
Citizen's arrest by the logic police.

01:28.794 --> 01:30.394
Jake isn't answering texts or calls,

01:30.396 --> 01:31.539
you think he's gonna answer an e-vite?

01:31.564 --> 01:32.921
It'll be a surprise party.

01:32.945 --> 01:34.992
In fact, since he
just missed a kickback,

01:35.062 --> 01:37.764
let's take it up a notch
and throw him a rager.

01:37.789 --> 01:39.822
We'll make it up to
Jake. It'll be a Jake-up.

01:39.824 --> 01:41.691
Or is that when I broke up with him?

01:41.693 --> 01:43.593
And I'll host... my
parents are taking Morgan

01:43.595 --> 01:44.906
to see her grandparents this weekend,

01:44.931 --> 01:46.631
and I already bailed because their house

01:46.656 --> 01:48.289
always smells like instant soup.

01:48.305 --> 01:49.738
I'll get the booze.

01:49.740 --> 01:50.672
[moans]

01:51.885 --> 01:53.773
I'll take this when you're ready.

01:55.512 --> 01:58.146
Oh, [bleep], my wallet's
in my locker at the club.

01:58.148 --> 01:59.548
So are our purses.

01:59.550 --> 02:01.316
In my car, at the club.

02:01.318 --> 02:03.328
Looks like it's time to dine and ditch.

02:03.649 --> 02:04.915
On three.

02:05.138 --> 02:06.164
Three!

02:09.192 --> 02:10.399
[bleep]

02:12.262 --> 02:15.061

Oh, I just love matching socks.

02:22.148 --> 02:24.114
Here's your friend, Señor Stripey!

02:24.116 --> 02:26.531
Oh, and here's your
husband, Mrs. Polka Dots.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.280
I can't believe those ass[bleep]!

02:28.282 --> 02:31.050
First, they do a terrible job,

02:31.052 --> 02:33.219
and then they have a party without me,

02:33.221 --> 02:34.620
and then they get me [bleep] fired.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.622
- So mean!
- And they don't even get it!

02:36.624 --> 02:38.190
For them, it's a summer job,

02:38.192 --> 02:39.458
but for me, it's a career.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.826
I don't know, Jakey.

02:40.828 --> 02:41.994
Maybe this was a good thing.

02:41.996 --> 02:44.864
How is me getting fired
possibly a good thing?

02:44.866 --> 02:46.899
Think of the job at
the country club like

02:46.901 --> 02:48.904
a tiny house with no gift-wrapping room.

02:48.929 --> 02:49.969
It's just a starter!

02:50.523 --> 02:52.163
Now you can move on to
bigger and better things.

02:52.445 --> 02:53.387
Like what?

02:53.389 --> 02:54.655
My daddy's boyfriend has

02:54.656 --> 02:55.955
this amazing start-up company

02:55.957 --> 02:57.624
where they wear really colorful shirts

02:57.626 --> 02:58.390
and fun sneakers,

02:58.415 --> 03:00.131
and you look so cute in brights.

03:00.156 --> 03:01.522
What does the start-up actually do?

03:01.524 --> 03:02.990
Unclear, but whatever it is,

03:02.992 --> 03:04.928
it pays way better
than the country club.

03:04.953 --> 03:06.527
- [sighs]
- Come on, Jake.

03:06.529 --> 03:08.095
Don't you want to try something new?

03:08.120 --> 03:09.026
Yeah.

03:09.646 --> 03:11.112
Yeah.

03:11.434 --> 03:13.769
Yeah, I don't need the
stupid country club.

03:13.931 --> 03:15.731
You are the best.

03:16.656 --> 03:18.322
You are the best.

03:18.324 --> 03:19.823
That's what Don DeLillo said to me

03:19.826 --> 03:21.393
after reading my searing memoir

03:21.395 --> 03:23.128
about my struggle with sex addiction.

03:23.130 --> 03:24.696
But then he asked me,

03:24.698 --> 03:26.264
"Who is the next you?

03:26.266 --> 03:28.310
Who's the voice of their generation?"

03:28.335 --> 03:31.117
- And I realized I didn't know!
- <i>[phone dings]</i>

03:31.142 --> 03:33.342
_

03:33.367 --> 03:34.445
Jenna.

03:34.470 --> 03:35.602
Are you with me?

03:35.742 --> 03:37.409
Always, Lizzy.

03:37.411 --> 03:39.044
And I appreciate the support.

03:39.312 --> 03:40.945
That's why I started Idea Bin,

03:40.947 --> 03:44.182
so that I could nurture the
next generation of writers.

03:44.184 --> 03:45.600
And looking around at some of you,

03:45.625 --> 03:47.625
I can see I have done just that.

03:47.650 --> 03:49.556
Mia. Max.

03:49.919 --> 03:52.257
Luke. Ophelia.

03:52.282 --> 03:55.093
You have all exceeded my expectations.

03:55.095 --> 03:57.295
<i>Wait, what about me?
Did I miss something?</i>

03:57.320 --> 03:59.881
<i>Have I not exceeded
Lizzy's expectations?</i>

03:59.906 --> 04:01.279
<i>Or have I not met them?</i>

04:01.304 --> 04:02.600
For the first time

04:02.602 --> 04:05.334
in Idea Bin's storied three-year history,

04:05.359 --> 04:07.272
we want to give one of
our editorial fellows

04:07.274 --> 04:09.574
the opportunity to
write an e-book for us.

04:09.929 --> 04:12.877
Now, I think there's an obvious choice.

04:12.879 --> 04:14.045
That being said,

04:14.047 --> 04:15.380
it is anyone's game.

04:15.382 --> 04:16.880
Most people's game.

04:17.577 --> 04:20.385
People who have had
multiple bylines' game.

04:20.387 --> 04:22.754
<i>Oh, God. I wasn't
meeting expectations.</i>

04:22.756 --> 04:25.223
<i>That's not fair. Maybe
I'm just a late bloomer.</i>

04:25.225 --> 04:27.359
Ophelia, what advice do you have

04:27.361 --> 04:29.294
for fellows who are feeling blocked?

04:29.296 --> 04:30.762
Dig deep.

04:30.764 --> 04:34.299
Write about the most
personal things in your life,

04:34.301 --> 04:36.434
the things that you
have really learned from.

04:36.436 --> 04:37.769
For me, it was the time

04:37.771 --> 04:39.471
that I had dinner with my therapist.

04:39.473 --> 04:41.339
Well, outside of the restaurant

04:41.341 --> 04:43.475
where he was having dinner.

04:43.477 --> 04:45.023
Unbeknownst to him.

04:46.113 --> 04:48.246
<i>[phone dings]</i>

04:49.949 --> 04:51.049

04:52.853 --> 04:55.165
<i>Okay, I knew what to write about.</i>

04:55.989 --> 04:58.723
I've had an easier time
getting on the list at Teflon

04:58.725 --> 05:00.725
than getting a goddamn soda here today.

05:00.727 --> 05:03.257
I want a soda!

05:03.830 --> 05:06.131
This place was way better
off when Jake was here.

05:06.133 --> 05:07.198
Of course it was.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.566
I can't wait for his party.

05:08.568 --> 05:10.201
He's gonna come over to the Hamilton's

05:10.203 --> 05:11.403
and thinks we're gonna have sex,

05:11.405 --> 05:12.771
but it's a party.

05:12.773 --> 05:14.806
And then, probably sex.

05:14.808 --> 05:17.342
Please never speak to me
about your disgusting sex life

05:17.344 --> 05:18.933
with that human milkshake again.

05:18.958 --> 05:20.879
It's actually making me less excited

05:20.904 --> 05:22.191
to hook up with Sergio... J/K!

05:22.216 --> 05:23.504
Nothing could make me less excited

05:23.506 --> 05:24.471
to hook up with Sergio.

05:24.473 --> 05:25.380
You haven't yet?

05:25.412 --> 05:26.950
I was dealing with the
red menace on the fourth,

05:26.974 --> 05:28.173
and then his stupid tamale truck

05:28.175 --> 05:29.775
got a gig in Palm Springs for the week.

05:29.777 --> 05:32.544
But at the party? It is on.

05:32.546 --> 05:33.946
Yay, sex!

05:33.948 --> 05:35.781
Yes, Lissa. Yay, sex.

05:35.783 --> 05:36.982
And yay me, because

05:36.984 --> 05:39.834
I'll get my own goddamn soda!

05:41.006 --> 05:42.754
Un-[bleep]-believable.

<i>of drowning in a pool

<i>I'd emerged with a piece

05:50.368 --> 05:52.068
<i>It was about Matty.</i>

05:52.070 --> 05:53.836
<i>How we'd gone through
the ringer as a couple,</i>

<i>we'd become real friends.</i>

Check your email. I
just sent you something.

it's been great working with you.

Wait, what?

Babe, you got to pick up
what Lizzy's throwing down.

06:27.580 --> 06:28.763
I mean, if your next piece doesn't go

06:28.788 --> 06:30.347
"Contagion"-level viral,

06:30.372 --> 06:32.105
you're gonna go from
editorial fellowship

06:32.107 --> 06:34.041
to ad sales, and I think we both know

<i>It was a little
"Twilight Zone," but hey,</i>

<i>not every episode of that
show was sinister, right?</i>

06:48.521 --> 06:50.802
<i>I actually don't know the
answer to that question.</i>

06:50.826 --> 06:53.036
I got him Fireblast
because we got him fired.

06:53.638 --> 06:55.521
Oh, my God. Fireblast.

06:55.545 --> 06:58.312
I haven't had that since
that time in junior year.

07:03.152 --> 07:05.119
Okay, Jake will be here in a few hours.

07:05.121 --> 07:07.021
I sent him out to buy
some interview clothes,

07:07.023 --> 07:08.456
which should keep him busy for a while.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.138
He keeps texting me
pictures of bright shirts

07:10.163 --> 07:11.696
asking if they look too flashy.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.499
So late, so sorry.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.834
The bakery did not
understand what I meant

07:15.836 --> 07:17.269
when I said "Monday morning at 'GQ'

07:17.271 --> 07:18.904
meets Rick Owens at an ice cream shop,"

07:18.906 --> 07:20.802
so I had to overhaul
the whole design concept.

07:20.827 --> 07:22.224
I'm very sure he'll notice that.

07:22.225 --> 07:24.443
I don't know, when I
think Jake, I think "GQ."

15:54.481 --> 15:56.581
Why are you taking the
country club job back?

15:56.583 --> 15:58.917
It's a job, and I'm good at it.

15:58.919 --> 16:00.532
Plus, I got a raise.

16:00.557 --> 16:03.522
But I thought you
wanted something better.

16:03.524 --> 16:05.930
Wait, you're the one
who got me that job.

16:05.955 --> 16:07.282
Now it's not good enough?

16:07.307 --> 16:09.399
Well, I just thought
it would be temporary.

16:09.424 --> 16:10.757
You know, just to get you out of the job

16:10.759 --> 16:12.492
where you had to wear the silly hat?

16:12.494 --> 16:13.314
Ah.

16:13.338 --> 16:15.471
I didn't think it would
become a way of life.

16:15.473 --> 16:18.374
Because it's not the way of life I want.

16:18.376 --> 16:21.144
I mean, you couldn't even hang
out with me on 4th of July.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.580
Well, it's what I want.

16:22.605 --> 16:24.738
I feel like I fit in there.

16:27.084 --> 16:28.565
I think we should break up.

16:29.721 --> 16:31.654
Wait, what?

16:31.656 --> 16:34.090
I don't think what you want
and what I want line up.

16:34.092 --> 16:36.826
All my life, I've wanted
to be a Palos Hills mom.

16:36.828 --> 16:38.111
And that doesn't mean being married

16:38.136 --> 16:39.635
to a country club manager.

16:39.659 --> 16:41.893
It means being married
to a country club member.

16:41.895 --> 16:44.963
- Jesus, Lissa!
- Don't bring him into it.

16:44.965 --> 16:48.071
And it's about both of us
having the lives we want.

16:48.096 --> 16:49.868
You shouldn't have
to change who you are,

16:49.870 --> 16:52.090
but neither should I.

16:56.742 --> 16:58.276
This is insane.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.011
You've gotten 100 new Twitter followers

17:00.013 --> 17:02.141
since the last time we refreshed it.

17:03.216 --> 17:04.096
The comments are loading

17:04.121 --> 17:05.810
faster than I can read them.

17:06.353 --> 17:08.920
"@IAmJennaHam is my new

17:08.922 --> 17:13.758
hero/spirit animal/girl crush for life!"

17:13.760 --> 17:15.727
This is freakin' awesome.

17:15.729 --> 17:17.595
<i>It was freaking awesome.</i>

17:17.597 --> 17:19.396
<i>My job at Idea Bin was safe.</i>

17:19.398 --> 17:22.002
<i>Hell, maybe I even had
a shot at the e-book.</i>

17:22.027 --> 17:23.518
<i>What would I call it?</i>

17:23.534 --> 17:25.099
<i>"I Am Jenna Hamilton?"</i>

17:25.102 --> 17:26.502
<i>"What I've Learned?"</i>

17:26.503 --> 17:28.117
<i>"A Millennial's Guide
To Love And... "</i>

17:28.143 --> 17:29.905
Hey, Jenna, weird question, but,

17:29.907 --> 17:31.440
did you write a super-detailed post

17:31.442 --> 17:33.506
about our relationship on Idea Bin?

17:34.879 --> 17:37.346
I thought you didn't read it.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.118
No, I don't. But I do check my phone.

17:39.143 --> 17:40.616
It started blowing up
with new Twitter followers

17:40.618 --> 17:42.305
and texts about the post.

17:43.254 --> 17:44.750
Nice headline, by the way.

17:44.775 --> 17:46.313
It's horrible, I know,

17:46.338 --> 17:47.729
but they changed it on me

17:47.737 --> 17:48.963
last-minute without telling me.

17:48.979 --> 17:51.313
It's totally not what I wrote.

17:51.315 --> 17:53.637
I think you'd actually
really like the article

17:53.662 --> 17:54.361
if you just read it.

17:54.386 --> 17:55.650
I don't care.

17:55.682 --> 17:57.654
You had no right to do this.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.930
That was you?

18:00.955 --> 18:02.579
You're the ex that [bleep] him up?

18:02.604 --> 18:04.304
I just thought you
were some second-tier

18:04.306 --> 18:05.906
high school girlfriend.

18:05.908 --> 18:09.541
You are a real bitch, bitch.

18:14.097 --> 18:16.232
[door opens and slams shut]

18:18.432 --> 18:21.668
[door opens]

18:21.670 --> 18:23.603
I'm gonna wait in the car.

18:27.041 --> 18:28.808
Look, I know the title's bad,

18:28.810 --> 18:30.744
but would you please
just read the article?

18:30.746 --> 18:32.545
Oh, you want to talk about
what's in the article?

18:32.547 --> 18:33.564
Okay.

18:34.042 --> 18:35.797
"In the end, the most important thing

18:35.822 --> 18:37.343
"I learned in college was this:

18:37.345 --> 18:40.781
"sometimes, you know better
than the person you love.

18:41.482 --> 18:44.492
Sometimes it's up to you to
do the right thing for them."

18:45.650 --> 18:47.587
It's condescending as hell, Jenna.

18:47.589 --> 18:48.854
I don't understand.

18:48.856 --> 18:50.856
Just the other day, you told me

18:50.858 --> 18:53.400
that I was right to
tell you not to transfer.

18:53.425 --> 18:54.904
Yes, I told you.

18:54.929 --> 18:56.172
I didn't tell the world.

18:56.533 --> 18:58.097
I'm... I'm not like you, Jenna.

18:58.099 --> 18:59.932
I don't want everybody
to know my business.

18:59.934 --> 19:02.868
I know, and that's why
I didn't use your name.

19:02.893 --> 19:03.979
Yeah, you called me "Mark" and said

19:04.010 --> 19:04.955
I was on a football scholarship.

19:04.963 --> 19:06.640
Good [bleep] job.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.744
There's a picture of me in the comments.

19:08.752 --> 19:10.704
I didn't put that picture up there.

19:10.729 --> 19:13.422
I didn't know any of that could happen.

19:13.424 --> 19:15.651
All right? Just...

19:16.393 --> 19:19.493
It's been very hard at work,

19:19.518 --> 19:21.118
and I thought I was gonna get fired,

19:21.143 --> 19:23.610
and so I was just trying

19:23.612 --> 19:26.780
to write a true piece,

19:26.782 --> 19:28.960
and dig deep.

19:29.822 --> 19:32.563
To me, that is our break up

19:32.588 --> 19:34.221
and how it affected us.

19:34.223 --> 19:36.810
You don't know a single
thing about our break up!

19:38.184 --> 19:40.007
I was destroyed.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.467
And really [bleep] depressed.

19:44.221 --> 19:46.305
I thought about dropping out of school.

19:47.580 --> 19:49.391
You know, it took me a
really, really long time

19:49.393 --> 19:50.518
to get back to good.

19:50.761 --> 19:51.893
- Matty...
- No!

19:51.895 --> 19:53.360
You never once checked in on me

19:53.385 --> 19:54.813
to see how I was doing.

19:54.838 --> 19:56.264
So I don't know why you'd think you know

19:56.266 --> 19:57.199
for a single second

19:57.201 --> 19:58.858
how this break up affected me.

19:59.236 --> 20:01.383
Matty, I'm so sorry. I didn't know...

20:01.408 --> 20:03.435
Yeah, you know what? I'm sorry too.

20:04.393 --> 20:05.774
I'm sorry I thought we could be friends,

20:05.776 --> 20:06.908
because the reality is,

20:06.910 --> 20:08.554
you haven't changed at all.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.838
I'm sorry!

20:16.537 --> 20:18.805
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

20:23.752 --> 20:26.561
I'm [bleep] sorry!

20:26.563 --> 20:28.330
Okay?

20:28.332 --> 20:29.914
[sniffles]

20:29.939 --> 20:31.146
