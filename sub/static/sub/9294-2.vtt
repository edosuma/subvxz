00:13.280 --> 00:16.250
We're done debating this, joe.

00:16.900 --> 00:19.840
The un's been issuing
reprimands and economic sanctions

00:19.860 --> 00:23.840
while benjamin juma has slaughtered
over 200,000 of his own people.

00:23.870 --> 00:28.130
That number will continue to
grow if we don't stop him now.

00:28.140 --> 00:29.260
Did you find something?

00:29.270 --> 00:34.190
I did. It doesn't confirm how your
son died, but it is suspicious.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.010
I'm listening.

00:36.020 --> 00:41.380
His girlfriend, samantha, received a large lump
sum deposit about three days after roger's suicide.

00:41.390 --> 00:43.420
You mean his alleged suicide.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.290
I'll talk to her myself.

00:45.310 --> 00:48.760
Sorry for interrupting, senator.
We have a subpoena for jack bauer.

00:49.270 --> 00:51.360
He's being questioned by
the united states senate.

00:51.380 --> 00:53.400
We need mr. Bauer immediately.

00:53.410 --> 00:57.510
The cip firewall protects every major
infrastructure system in this country.

00:57.540 --> 01:00.040
If it were breached they
would all be vulnerable.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.840
The department of justice is about
to file criminal charges against me.

01:02.860 --> 01:04.959
I'm not exactly in a
position to help you.

01:04.970 --> 01:08.370
One of the men behind this
threat is someone you know.

01:08.390 --> 01:11.010
You think tony's looking for
justice by attacking this country?

01:11.040 --> 01:14.080
Help me find almeida, and
you can ask him yourself.

01:14.090 --> 01:15.890
Where's tony almeida?

01:15.910 --> 01:17.510
I'm not talking to you.

01:17.530 --> 01:20.410
- This is your call.
- Do whatever it takes.

01:22.260 --> 01:26.100
All right! All right! All
right! I'll tell you what I know!

01:27.410 --> 01:29.920
Last time I saw almeida...

01:33.800 --> 01:37.030
there's nothing you or
the fbi can do about this.

01:37.550 --> 01:38.860
Just stay away.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.620
Tony, just talk to me. tony!

01:41.630 --> 01:44.300
Gsa 117, this is northeast three.

01:44.310 --> 01:46.370
Go ahead, air traffic control.

01:46.380 --> 01:48.140
Advise passing 7,000.

01:48.170 --> 01:50.650
Should be a smoother
ride for you down there.

01:50.680 --> 01:52.130
Roger that, northeast three.

01:52.150 --> 01:55.580
Gsa 117, enter descent for 1,500.

01:55.590 --> 01:58.040
I've lost comm with gsa 117.

01:58.060 --> 01:59.240
Call back fbi.

01:59.260 --> 02:03.130
Tell them we have a 767 on approach
no longer under our control.

02:04.250 --> 02:08.910
***********

02:14.380 --> 02:16.630
Anybody get through to
global skies 117 yet?

02:16.640 --> 02:18.850
Not yet, sir. We're trying everything.

02:18.860 --> 02:19.980
Where's the plane?

02:19.990 --> 02:23.530
120 miles miles southwest
of jfk. Right here.

02:23.770 --> 02:25.860
All right, we have
to alert them somehow.

02:25.900 --> 02:27.230
Analyze the projected flight path.

02:27.260 --> 02:29.580
Figure out if there's any way we can
contact them visually from the ground.

02:29.610 --> 02:31.860
Todd, access the passenger records.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.180
Get as many cell numbers as
you can and try calling them.

02:34.190 --> 02:35.110
Yes, sir.

02:35.130 --> 02:36.940
Nothing on the emergency channels?

02:36.960 --> 02:40.810
They're not trying to contact anyone,
but they just descended to 1,500.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.460
I don't know on whose directions.

02:42.470 --> 02:44.120
- Sir, I think I've got it.
- Got what?

02:44.130 --> 02:47.250
Listen to this. This was recorded
right after we lost comm with them.

02:47.260 --> 02:49.900
Gsa 117, this is northeast three.

02:49.930 --> 02:51.470
Go ahead, air traffic control.

02:51.490 --> 02:54.680
Advise passing 7,000. Maintain 1,500.

02:54.690 --> 02:57.000
Traffic ahead reporting
minor turbulence.

02:57.020 --> 02:59.960
Should be a smoother
ride for you down there.

03:00.750 --> 03:03.490
They think they're
communicating with us.

03:06.430 --> 03:07.100
Bureau.

03:07.110 --> 03:08.680
This is air traffic
control, northeast three.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.500
I need to talk to
agent moss. It's urgent.

03:10.510 --> 03:13.020
I'll put you through.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.250
Agent moss, I'm transferring
air traffic control again.

03:16.270 --> 03:18.120
What's your status, sid?

03:18.140 --> 03:22.230
Larry, the people that broke through the
firewall are controlling one of my planes.

03:22.240 --> 03:25.590
They're talking directly to the pilot
as if they're air traffic control.

03:25.620 --> 03:29.390
As long as the pilot thinks he's talking to
one of us, he'll do whatever they tell him.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.360
My god...

03:31.370 --> 03:34.720
Gsa 117, this is
northeast three control.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.110
go ahead, air traffic control.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.010
Standby for new runway assignment.

03:38.020 --> 03:40.690
Turn right, heading
zero-six-zero.

03:40.710 --> 03:44.600
Intercept radar vectors
for runway three-one-left.

03:44.910 --> 03:48.680
Northeast three, we're showing
jfk weather systems unchanged.

03:49.540 --> 03:53.730
Yeah, we've had a change in wind direction.
Locally, there's danger of wind shear.

03:53.740 --> 03:55.010
Roger that, northeast three.

03:55.020 --> 03:57.890
We're turning to heading
zero-six-zero now.

03:58.350 --> 04:02.030
All right, they're changing course.

04:05.430 --> 04:08.470
I just got off the phone with sid paulson
at northeast three air traffic control.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.310
Almeida's group is
definitely in their system.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.350
Larry... nsa just detected it.

04:12.360 --> 04:15.180
They're trying to locate the point
of entry, but they're not optimistic.

04:15.190 --> 04:17.769
Forget where they got into the system.
How the hell do we get them out?

04:17.779 --> 04:21.240
They don't know. They've never
seen anything like this before.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.000
I got the alley.

04:25.010 --> 04:26.810
Larry, go to channel two.

04:28.770 --> 04:29.960
Yeah, go ahead.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.760
I hope you got information from
schector. This thing has escalated.

04:32.770 --> 04:33.860
"Escalated" how?

04:33.890 --> 04:37.020
Almeida's group has picked out a 767
in flight. They're controlling it.

04:37.030 --> 04:38.150
What? Why, to what end?

04:38.160 --> 04:40.590
I don't know, but we've
got to find this guy.

04:40.600 --> 04:41.810
What did schector say?

04:41.840 --> 04:44.540
- Not much before he was killed.
- What?

04:44.550 --> 04:47.770
Sniper across the street. We sealed off the
building immediately; we know he's in there.

04:52.690 --> 04:55.070
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it was surgical.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.990
I'm sending you swat teams
to search the building.

04:57.010 --> 04:58.950
Thank you. Swat teams are on their way.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.550
I think you got a problem.

05:00.580 --> 05:02.840
Almeida called that office
seconds after schector was killed.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.230
How do you think he knew I was there?

05:04.240 --> 05:05.530
I'm assuming he had him under watch.

05:05.560 --> 05:08.520
- I think it came from your office.
- What?

05:08.530 --> 05:10.740
Someone from inside the
fbi had to tip him off.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.830
They were the only people
who knew I was going with you.

05:12.870 --> 05:13.930
No, I can't believe that.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.920
Yeah, and I didn't want to believe
tony almeida was a terrorist,

05:15.960 --> 05:19.030
but at some point we have to deal with the
facts, not what we want to believe is true.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.190
Look, jack, I read your file.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.060
I know you have a propensity
for not trusting people,

05:22.080 --> 05:24.320
but my team has been working
around the clock to find almeida;

05:24.340 --> 05:25.370
they are all good agents.

05:25.390 --> 05:27.580
Explain to me how they got a
sniper on the roof that quickly.

05:27.610 --> 05:29.800
I told you, almeida
had schector staked out.

05:30.150 --> 05:31.620
We were in schector's
office for ten minutes.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.550
There is no way they got a
shooter in position that fast.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.510
Now, until you know where the leak is, you
have to assume that you've got a bad agent,

05:37.540 --> 05:40.390
and you need to work around him.

05:40.750 --> 05:44.990
No offense, jack, but I brought you here to help
with schector, not to co-manage this operation.

05:45.010 --> 05:46.770
You brought me here to
help you find almeida.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.280
And I am warning you, you
better be careful who you let in.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.120
Mr.Bauer, I need you
to surrender the gun.

06:01.340 --> 06:04.560
Agent kilner... jack bauer, put
him in your vehicle till I get back.

06:04.570 --> 06:07.100
Yes, ma'am. This way, sir.

06:17.130 --> 06:18.140
What's your status?

06:18.170 --> 06:20.030
We secured the building;
all exits are covered.

06:20.060 --> 06:24.080
When swat team gets here, we'll have video
feed and we'll sweep the building room by room.

06:24.090 --> 06:27.220
- If the shooter's in there, we'll find him.
- He's in there.

06:43.460 --> 06:47.260
Janis, whatever you've got on faa,
leave it with to sean. Come here.

06:47.270 --> 06:50.330
- Wait a minute. I need her here.
- So do I.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.460
There was sniper fire at schector's
office. We've got three dead bodies.

06:55.470 --> 06:56.400
- Where renee was?
- Yeah.

06:56.410 --> 06:59.110
- Is she okay?
- She's fine. Listen, I need you to provide support.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.180
Renee thinks s has the sniper
locked in the columbia building.

07:01.210 --> 07:03.560
- There are swat teams on the way; coordinate with them.
- Okay.

07:03.570 --> 07:05.830
Anything else from nsa on how
we get through to that plane?

07:05.850 --> 07:08.150
No, but we talked to one of
the men who worked with latham,

07:08.160 --> 07:12.290
who said that based on the way the firewall
was breeched, he doesn't think we can contact.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.300
- yeah?
- Yeah, it's agent moss.

07:20.310 --> 07:21.850
Hey, got any help for us?

07:21.860 --> 07:23.900
Nsa's nowhere. What about you?

07:23.910 --> 07:25.460
We're trying to contact passengers.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.700
So far we haven't been
able to get through tanyone.

07:27.730 --> 07:28.710
What about air force?

07:28.740 --> 07:32.700
They've scrambled an f-16 to intercept,
but it's still about 13 minutes out.

07:32.730 --> 07:35.070
- Look, let me get back to you.
- Yeah.

07:35.390 --> 07:37.150
Gus, have you been able to
break into their channel yet?

07:37.180 --> 07:39.220
No, but I can hear almeida
talking with the pilot.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.910
He's landing him on
runway three-one-left.

07:41.930 --> 07:44.550
It can't be that simple.

07:45.170 --> 07:49.610
These people didn't take control of this plane
just so they can land it on a different runway.

07:49.950 --> 07:52.940
Todd, what do you got on
your radar that's on approach?

07:52.950 --> 07:55.100
Everything looks good.

07:55.110 --> 07:56.820
And gsa 117?

07:56.840 --> 07:58.950
Nothing near it.

07:59.910 --> 08:01.570
what the hell is this?

08:01.590 --> 08:02.790
What happened?

08:02.800 --> 08:05.280
All the scres for the
eastern quadrant are locked.

08:05.290 --> 08:07.330
Try the backup systems.

08:08.050 --> 08:09.110
they're not working.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.000
- Todd! It's locked!
- Mine, too.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.860
Okay, they're blind.

08:16.480 --> 08:21.400
All right... send their sunrise flight into
an intersecting landing pattern with 117.

08:21.410 --> 08:25.280
Sri35, this is northeast three control.

08:27.230 --> 08:30.070
We have a new runway assignment for you.

08:30.090 --> 08:33.799
Set your vectors for
final: Runway four-right.

08:33.820 --> 08:36.320
Roger that, northeast three.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.980
He's changing course.

08:49.210 --> 08:51.490
- paulson.
- How do your screens look over there?

08:51.500 --> 08:53.320
- Who is this?
- That doesn't matter.

08:53.330 --> 08:57.340
What matters is that I
took out your control units.

08:57.860 --> 08:59.550
Call the bureau. Trace this call.

08:59.560 --> 09:02.760
- What the hell do you want?
- Want you to see what we can do.

09:04.050 --> 09:07.520
Why don't you pull up the
surveillance cameras at jfk tower.

09:09.870 --> 09:12.540
Give me the cameras at jfk.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.680
Sid, there's another plane
landing on four-right.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.700
It crosses
three-one-left.

09:18.710 --> 09:20.990
Oh, my god, they're
on a collision course.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.840
Scramble emergency at jfk.

09:46.110 --> 09:49.070
Gsa 117, pull up. Safety alert, pull up.

09:49.080 --> 09:52.260
- Traffic on runway
four-right. - Pull up.

10:08.810 --> 10:11.910
sir,we have screens
and communication back.

10:11.950 --> 10:13.180
Phil...

10:13.230 --> 10:14.700
we're good.

10:18.080 --> 10:18.640
yeah.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.760
That was just a warning shot.

10:20.780 --> 10:23.720
Whatever we do next will
not be a demonstration.

10:23.740 --> 10:25.340
It'll be the real thing.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.970
What do you people want?

10:26.990 --> 10:29.620
You'll find out soon enough.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.300
it's emerson.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.150
Emerson's here.

11:27.330 --> 11:29.590
Get the module ready.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.370
Uncuff him.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.460
What happened to those planes?

11:41.490 --> 11:43.820
Don't worry about that.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.170
Did you crash them?

11:45.200 --> 11:47.280
How many people did you kill?

11:50.700 --> 11:52.950
Get him cleaned up.

12:06.340 --> 12:07.790
Hey,tony.

12:07.820 --> 12:08.910
David.

12:08.930 --> 12:10.840
I take it everything went as planned.

12:10.870 --> 12:14.120
Yeah. The off-site testing
the module worked perfectly.

12:14.130 --> 12:15.900
Let's see it

12:24.760 --> 12:26.750
good.

12:28.370 --> 12:30.800
That's our genius,huh?

12:31.150 --> 12:33.390
Yes,it is.

12:33.530 --> 12:35.770
Had to be encouraged?

12:35.790 --> 12:38.170
Yeah,but...I've got him to a place
where he'll do whatever you want.

12:38.170 --> 12:39.800
Can I talk to you a second?

12:39.810 --> 12:41.530
Take the module.

12:44.290 --> 12:48.940
So,tell me how the fbi
managed to find schector.

12:48.970 --> 12:50.910
They used an old colleague of mine.

12:50.930 --> 12:54.320
An agent I worked with
at ctu named jack bauer.

12:54.350 --> 12:56.200
I know who bauer is.

12:56.220 --> 12:57.690
Yeah,well,he's not
going to be a problem.

12:57.720 --> 13:01.410
I took care of schector before
he could tell the fbi anything.

13:01.420 --> 13:03.270
I'll take care of jack bauer,too.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.260
I n't want you distracted
from this new job.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.870
Speaking of which,you
haven't told me what that is.

13:07.890 --> 13:08.760
Tanner has the specs.

13:08.770 --> 13:11.140
He'll brief you when he gets here.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.840
Why don't you just tell me now?

13:13.860 --> 13:16.440
'Cause you don't need to know yet.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.790
Tony,we've been doing this three years.

13:18.810 --> 13:23.210
The less information any one
of us has,the safer we all are.

13:23.620 --> 13:26.300
Come on,after this next job,we're done.

13:26.330 --> 13:30.200
Cash in our chips,do whatever we want.

13:30.460 --> 13:31.740
All right.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.880
I'll call you when tanner gets here.

13:33.900 --> 13:34.950
Okay.

13:34.970 --> 13:36.470
Let's go.

13:36.970 --> 13:39.580
Come on,let's go.

13:39.940 --> 13:41.370
I'm about to make a statement,sir.

13:41.390 --> 13:43.600
Are there any changes
I should know about?

13:43.610 --> 13:44.850
No,this is fine.

13:44.880 --> 13:50.600
Just remember,don't indicate when the go-ahead to
invade will be given,no matter how hard they push.

13:50.620 --> 13:54.420
But it's acceptable to mention that the president
is meeting with former prime minister matobo?

13:54.440 --> 13:55.190
Yes.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.680
And when they ask whether the
president sees him as juma's successor?

13:58.710 --> 14:00.550
No need to hide that fact.

14:00.580 --> 14:04.200
President wants maximum exsure
on her support for matobo.

14:04.230 --> 14:05.900
Thank you,sir.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.520
good morning,ladies and gentlemen.

14:15.540 --> 14:20.280
Despite obal condemnation and
un-imposed economic sanctions,

14:20.320 --> 14:24.000
general benjamin juma has
refused to stop the genocide that

14:24.030 --> 14:29.190
his brutal dictatorship has been
perpetrating since he took power.

14:29.210 --> 14:35.250
President taylor has made a persuasive case to the world
that a full-scale military intervention by us forces

14:35.290 --> 14:38.850
and a complete overthrow of the
juma regime would be the only way

14:38.880 --> 14:43.950
to stop the continued slaughter of the
innocent men,women and children of sangala.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.190
yes,you there.

14:45.210 --> 14:48.920
Angela,has the president formulated
a timeframe for this intervention?

14:48.960 --> 14:50.700
Hello.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.990
Jfk?

14:55.230 --> 14:56.960
How long ago did this happen?

14:56.990 --> 15:00.990
I can tell you that president taylor
and former prime minister ule matobo

15:01.030 --> 15:05.950
are meeting as we speak to
formulate a post-invasion strategy.

15:05.980 --> 15:11.010
I know how hard you fought to get the support
needed to launch this military operation.

15:11.030 --> 15:13.870
And I want you to know my country
will be eternally grateful.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.860
Our soldiersre the ones truly
deserving of your gratitude.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.710
They're the people putting
their lives on the line.

15:19.730 --> 15:22.930
Still,I know you are taking
a great political risk.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.830
I have no reservations.

15:24.860 --> 15:27.460
Stopping juma is the right thing to do.

15:27.480 --> 15:33.830
But once he's been removed from power,it is
critical that he be dealt with in a court of law.

15:33.860 --> 15:37.660
And not in a way that would
perpetuate the cycle of violence.

15:37.690 --> 15:42.710
Juma has killed over 200,000 of our
people,including two of my own brothers.

15:42.740 --> 15:46.620
So no one knows more about the
"cycle of violence" than I do.

15:46.630 --> 15:49.400
But my countrymen will
want to see juma punished.

15:49.420 --> 15:52.840
Then punish him according
to the rule of law.

15:52.850 --> 15:56.060
That's the only way democracy
will work in sangala.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.480
If no one is treated outside the law.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.080
Not even juma.

16:10.750 --> 16:13.200
You have my word.

16:19.700 --> 16:24.290
And now,I'd like for us to go over some last-minute
operational points with my secretary of defense.

16:24.310 --> 16:26.180
All right.

16:27.990 --> 16:30.320
Excuse me,mr.Matobo.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.960
What's the emergency,ethan?

16:34.980 --> 16:39.730
Northeast air traffic control just reported a
near-miss between two commercial flights at jfk.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.890
Fortunately,no one was hurt.

16:41.910 --> 16:44.220
And we think this man
almeida was behind it?

16:44.240 --> 16:45.020
It's him.

16:45.040 --> 16:46.880
We verified his voice print.

16:46.890 --> 16:50.940
He contacted air traffic control and
told them this was a demonstration;

16:50.980 --> 16:52.440
a shot across the bow,so to speak.

16:52.460 --> 16:53.450
What does he want?

16:53.470 --> 17:00.350
His exact words were:
"You'll find out soon enough."

17:00.620 --> 17:02.730
Oh,this is unacceptable.

17:02.740 --> 17:04.579
I mean,it's just technology.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.710
We should be able to
unplug these bastards.

17:06.730 --> 17:09.390
Well,we're trying everything we can
think of,but it's not that simple.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.089
What's being done to find almeida?

17:11.109 --> 17:14.140
The fbi believes they're closing
in on one of his associates.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.000
What's their timeframe?

17:16.020 --> 17:17.300
That's unclear.

17:17.319 --> 17:22.819
Let's go ahead with grounding all nonessential air
traffic,and set up a meeting with homeland,fbi,and dod.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.720
Yes,madam president.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.720
Yeah.

17:30.190 --> 17:31.440
Who is it?

17:31.460 --> 17:32.180
Hold on.

17:32.230 --> 17:34.010
Tanner.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.240
Hey,tanner,what's going on?

17:39.270 --> 17:42.930
I'm trapped in the columbia building.

17:42.950 --> 17:44.700
Fbi's sweeping it right
now,floor by floor.

17:44.740 --> 17:47.390
I don't know how the hell
I'll be able to get past them.

17:47.390 --> 17:49.740
I understand. Exactly where
in the building are you?

17:49.780 --> 17:50.940
The basement.

17:50.970 --> 17:54.070
Near the west stairwell.

17:56.150 --> 17:57.590
We're on 12th.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.030
Roger that,alpha.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.280
M Sixth floor's clear. We're moving.

18:01.300 --> 18:04.260
Charlie two,moving to the fifth floor.

18:04.290 --> 18:05.870
Proceed.

18:08.820 --> 18:10.740
Mr.Bauer?

18:10.820 --> 18:12.980
Yeah?

18:13.750 --> 18:15.490
I just wanted
to tell you--

18:15.520 --> 18:20.110
what they're making you go through
at that senate hearing,it's wrong.

18:21.660 --> 18:24.190
No,it's not.

18:24.940 --> 18:28.770
It's better that everything
comes out in the open.

18:28.850 --> 18:37.440
We've done so many secret things over the years in the
name of protecting this country we've created two worlds:

18:37.470 --> 18:40.600
Ours and the people
we promised to protect.

18:40.610 --> 18:43.430
They deserve to know the truth.

18:43.470 --> 18:46.090
Then they can decide how
far they want to let us go.

18:46.120 --> 18:50.890
Still,you don't deserve
to be treated that way,

18:50.900 --> 18:54.290
not after what you've
done for our country.

18:54.470 --> 18:57.660
And I'm not the only one who thinks so.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.750
Thank you.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.950
Entering the basement
from the west stairwell.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.620
Roger that,agent lennert.

19:53.990 --> 19:55.650
I'm here to get you out.

19:55.660 --> 19:57.820
Tony sent me.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.980
How?

20:03.480 --> 20:05.160
Put this on.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.030
A swat unit just cleared the stairwell.

20:07.050 --> 20:09.280
Take it up to the lobby.

20:10.560 --> 20:15.260
There's a gray ford parked next to the
kiosk in the lot behind the building.

20:15.630 --> 20:17.210
Go.

20:21.950 --> 20:23.380
This is lennert.

20:23.710 --> 20:25.370
Basement level is clear.

20:25.440 --> 20:26.250
Roger that.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.730
Alpha team is clearing the first
floor.You can hook up with them.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.390
On my way.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.870
Agent walker,she's good,huh?

20:32.980 --> 20:34.410
Yes,sir.

20:34.510 --> 20:36.810
She understands what it
takes to get the job done.

20:40.350 --> 20:42.160
You mind if I step out and get some air?

20:42.280 --> 20:44.210
It's been a hell of a morning.

20:44.450 --> 20:45.800
Yeah,sure thing.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.520
Just stay close,sir.

20:47.770 --> 20:49.240
Yeah.Thanks.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.080
Just got an update from headquarters.

21:03.220 --> 21:06.540
Your friend,tony almeida,just used the device
to orchestrate a neariss between two planes.

21:06.670 --> 21:09.020
He's threatening to
do it for real ne time.

21:13.810 --> 21:15.630
Are all your men represented
on the deployment grid?

21:15.720 --> 21:17.270
Yeah.Why?

21:17.410 --> 21:20.170
I don't want you to do anything
now,but see that man walking away?

21:20.410 --> 21:22.170
That's your shooter.

21:22.340 --> 21:23.640
How can that be possible?

21:23.730 --> 21:26.600
If one of your people helped him get
through the perimeter.Check the grid.

21:29.140 --> 21:30.940
Look out.

21:34.790 --> 21:36.270
You're right.He's not one of ours.

21:36.340 --> 21:38.270
We'll follow him,see if he leads
us back to almeida-- dornan.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.550
No,that's not the right move.

21:40.870 --> 21:45.910
You can't bring anyone else into this,not until
you know how badly the bureau's been compromised.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.580
Okay,so what are you suggesting?

21:47.710 --> 21:49.400
We can do this on our own.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.630
Yes,agent walker?

21:52.440 --> 21:54.040
Ma'am?

21:54.170 --> 21:56.880
Put more agents on the eastern edge of
the building.The perimeter looks light.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.380
On it.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.320
- You made the right call.
- We'll see.

22:02.130 --> 22:04.100
I need your vehicle.

22:25.710 --> 22:27.750
We have some breaking news
to tell you about right now.

22:27.840 --> 22:34.630
The faa nfirms a near-miss between two planes at
jfk international airport just a short time ago.

22:34.750 --> 22:38.280
As a result,outgoing flights
nationwide are now grounded.

22:38.350 --> 22:41.110
Planes already in the air will
be grounded once they land.

22:41.220 --> 22:41.760
The faa...

22:41.850 --> 22:43.360
listen to me,latham.

22:43.420 --> 22:45.450
Do as you're told,you'll stay alive.

22:45.540 --> 22:47.990
You understand?

22:48.090 --> 22:49.850
Put him in storage.Watch him.

22:56.260 --> 22:59.380
an effective demonstration,wouldn't
you say,mr.Dubaku?

23:00.760 --> 23:02.420
Very effective.

23:02.550 --> 23:04.840
General juma will be pleased.

23:05.530 --> 23:08.460
Is that the module?As promised.

23:08.880 --> 23:13.650
And I've brought the man who constructed it here
in case there are any modifications necessary.

23:13.730 --> 23:17.460
Well,now that we've impressed upon the
white house what we can do,mr.Dubaku,

23:17.590 --> 23:21.600
perhaps now would be a good time to make
your demands known to president taylor.

23:23.120 --> 23:25.140
Make the preparations.

23:25.710 --> 23:28.790
Your government killed my
other and they tried to kill me.

23:28.980 --> 23:32.460
Now they are going to pay
a very steep price for...

23:32.820 --> 23:35.210
interfering in our affairs.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.990
Faa is landing flights,so
far without incident,

23:41.060 --> 23:42.640
but these people have
proven what they can do,

23:42.760 --> 23:48.000
and at any time,can sabotage air traffic or any of
the infrastructure systems we have beyond the firewall.

23:48.090 --> 23:51.920
Does nsa have a timeframe on fixing it
so we can keep these pele out permanently?

23:52.020 --> 23:55.920
Madame president,the cip firewall was
the result of a multi-year project.

23:56.030 --> 23:58.220
Reengineering the code
could take weeks or months.

23:58.300 --> 24:00.490
At this point,nsa just doesn't know.

24:00.580 --> 24:03.710
Exactly what systems are
vulnerable,dr.Cornell?

24:03.800 --> 24:07.140
At the top of the list would
be the national power grid.

24:07.240 --> 24:11.150
If disabled,we could end up being unable
to deliver power to many millions of people.

24:11.230 --> 24:15.060
A blackout of that scale would almost
certainly result in rioting in the major cities.

24:15.140 --> 24:18.900
Even more critical are the water
treatment and distribution systems.

24:18.970 --> 24:21.720
By sabotaging key dams and
sewage processing plants,

24:21.800 --> 24:24.450
they could contaminate drinking
water on a massive scale.

24:24.530 --> 24:27.510
Deaths from poisoning would
be substantial up front

24:27.570 --> 24:32.140
and massive casualties would follow soon
thereafter as people began to die from dehydration.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.320
Is there any way to
protect these systems?

24:34.400 --> 24:37.470
The only way would be shutting them
down,and then,within a short time,

24:37.570 --> 24:41.850
it would be impossible to supply the
population with sufficient food and clean water.

24:41.920 --> 24:45.960
The resulting civil unrest would
undoubtedly aggravate the situation.

24:46.850 --> 24:49.150
Here are the latest projections.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.000
Thank you.

25:03.660 --> 25:04.760
Ethan kanin.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.580
Mr.Kanin,this is agent gedge.

25:06.660 --> 25:08.100
I'm with the first gentleman.

25:08.250 --> 25:10.110
With him where?What's he doing?

25:10.200 --> 25:13.530
Mr.Taylor is on his way to
confront roger's former girlfriend.

25:13.650 --> 25:15.330
I thought he gave up on all of this.

25:15.450 --> 25:18.940
Sir,he's consumed by the idea that his son
was murdered,and for the past two months,

25:19.020 --> 25:23.830
he's been pursuing that belief through a private
detective he hired without the president's knowledge.

25:24.260 --> 25:26.090
My god.

25:26.840 --> 25:29.320
Why is this the first time I'm
hearing anything about this?

25:29.390 --> 25:31.190
I take full responsibility for that,sir.

25:31.270 --> 25:34.310
Mr.Taylor enlisted me in keeping his
activities off the official manifest,

25:34.410 --> 25:37.520
but,uh,it's gotten out of hand.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.970
And at this point,I'm
worried about mr.Taylor'S...

25:41.090 --> 25:42.620
state of mind.

25:42.780 --> 25:44.390
I think the president needs
to know what's going on.

25:44.450 --> 25:46.070
All right.

25:46.190 --> 25:48.330
Thank you,agent gedge.

25:52.790 --> 25:54.210
Agent gedge?

25:54.290 --> 25:55.650
- Sir?
- Everything all right?

25:55.720 --> 25:57.600
Yes,sir.Just checking in.

25:59.240 --> 26:03.270
Building disaster preparedness
scenarios is not enough.

26:03.390 --> 26:07.270
I want the governors to put the national
guard on a pre-deployment footing.

26:07.340 --> 26:09.400
And until we find and stop
the people behind this,

26:09.490 --> 26:12.270
I think we should talk about
raising the alert level.

26:12.550 --> 26:16.560
Yes,sir,we have the building locked down,and
we're searching for the suspect as we speak.

26:16.680 --> 26:18.550
It's our higst priority,sir.

26:18.650 --> 26:20.200
Understood,sir.

26:20.820 --> 26:22.950
The white house is all over
this.Homeland's leaning on us.

26:23.020 --> 26:24.790
We have got to find this guy now.

26:24.890 --> 26:27.230
Dornan's team is almost done with
their first sweep through the building,

26:27.290 --> 26:30.000
but he said it's his gut feeling
that the sniper is not in there.

26:30.040 --> 26:31.650
I don't care about his gut feeling.

26:31.710 --> 26:34.610
Renee said they had that building locked
down right after the shots were fired.

26:34.670 --> 26:36.350
- He's got to be in there.
- Yes,sir.

26:36.460 --> 26:37.870
Tell them to search every square inch.

26:38.810 --> 26:40.280
what?

26:41.180 --> 26:44.520
Dornan also wants to know if
we know where agent walker is.

26:44.680 --> 26:45.760
She's not at the scene?

26:45.920 --> 26:48.910
She left ten minutes ago
without logging her destination.

26:51.290 --> 26:52.530
What about bauer?

26:52.680 --> 26:54.560
He left the scene with her.

27:15.980 --> 27:17.780
He's coming up on heavy traffic.You
can drop back a little more.

27:17.870 --> 27:20.000
It's all right.I've got him.

27:22.750 --> 27:25.110
- it's larry.
- Don't answer it.

27:25.770 --> 27:28.170
Then he'll get worried or suspicious.

27:31.270 --> 27:33.570
Dornan said you left the scene.

27:33.850 --> 27:36.170
Why?What's going on?

27:36.280 --> 27:39.230
Swat has the operation well in
hand.I'm following up on a lead.

27:39.410 --> 27:40.620
What lead?

27:40.750 --> 27:42.810
A weapon we found at schector'S.There's
a partial serial number.

27:42.910 --> 27:44.520
I want to run it past a source.

27:44.670 --> 27:48.060
- With bauer?
- Uh,yes,he's accompanying me.

27:51.220 --> 27:53.010
Renee...

27:53.650 --> 27:55.660
what the hell's going on?

27:55.800 --> 27:57.920
What are you talking about?

27:58.150 --> 28:01.060
Getting our hands on that shooter is our best
chance of finding almeida and finding that device.

28:01.140 --> 28:04.780
And I don't think you'd turn your
back on that operation for a lead

28:04.840 --> 28:06.800
you could easily have
passed off to another agent.

28:06.910 --> 28:09.430
- I'm not sure what you're getting at.
- Neither am I.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.960
Has bauer gotten you
involved with something?

28:15.410 --> 28:17.580
Larry,do you trust me?

28:19.340 --> 28:21.260
You know the answer to that.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.040
Then please just accept
what I'm telling you.

28:23.130 --> 28:26.590
We're following up on a lead,and I will
fill you in if and when we find something.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.960
all right.

28:34.900 --> 28:37.100
Damn it.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.920
I do not like this.

28:40.020 --> 28:42.860
- I just flat out lied to my boss.
- Did he buy it?

28:43.570 --> 28:45.660
Are we in the clear?

28:46.390 --> 28:47.820
Yeah,I think so.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.660
Good.Thanks.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.370
is renee's comm unit active?

29:04.490 --> 29:05.950
Yeah.Her walkie's on.

29:06.060 --> 29:07.400
Can you do a triangulation on it?

29:07.500 --> 29:09.920
Well,that's not really what
the system is set up for.

29:11.240 --> 29:12.900
But I can try.

29:12.990 --> 29:15.120
Do more than try.I want
to know where she is.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.300
- Can you not just call her?
- Janis...

29:17.400 --> 29:19.510
- just do it.
- Okay.

29:36.340 --> 29:40.700
Back at schector's office,when I told
you to get almeida's locatio out of him,

29:41.120 --> 29:43.090
how far were you
planning to go with that?

29:43.160 --> 29:45.360
You told me to do whatever it takes.

29:45.450 --> 29:50.610
Yeah,I said that for schector's benefit,to scare
him,but you were actually planning to do it.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.300
How far would you have gone?

29:53.380 --> 29:55.110
It doesn't matter now.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.940
It does to me.

29:57.020 --> 30:00.130
I just put my career on the line because of
you,and I'd like to know who I'm dealing with.

30:00.210 --> 30:02.490
Yeah,well,you read my file.

30:02.590 --> 30:06.470
Your file doesn't tell me how you
justify the thingshat you've done.

30:06.760 --> 30:11.040
You know,I've been answering a lot of questions
lately about my past and,frankly,I'm done.

30:11.540 --> 30:13.220
I told you I'd help
you find tony almeida.

30:13.370 --> 30:15.390
I even agreed to do it your way.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.550
Since the fbi's been
compromised,that's no longer an option.

30:18.980 --> 30:23.280
Now,I can still help you find him,but you're going to have to let me do it my way.

30:23.280 --> 30:26.070
Is that going to be a problem?

30:26.960 --> 30:28.790
We'll see.

30:52.270 --> 30:54.090
I know you think this is a mistake.

30:54.090 --> 30:55.500
It's not my place to say that,sir.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.440
And if it was?

30:56.440 --> 30:59.130
The authorities have already questioned your son's girlfriend,sir.

30:59.130 --> 31:00.500
Not about this.

31:00.500 --> 31:04.400
They assumed my son killed himself and didn't look deeply enough into anything.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.050
This way,sir.

31:07.540 --> 31:11.440
Well,even though the market's been soft,you don't want to hedge your buy on this.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.100
It's really all I can do today.

31:13.100 --> 31:16.240
You know 10,000 shares isn't going to cut it.

31:16.240 --> 31:17.420
excuse me a moment.

31:17.420 --> 31:18.310
Samantha roth.

31:18.310 --> 31:21.410
Miss roth,there is a secret service agent here to see you.

31:21.410 --> 31:22.540
What?

31:22.540 --> 31:23.440
He's at reception.

31:23.440 --> 31:27.270
Would you like me to have someone show him to your desk?

31:31.180 --> 31:32.160
No.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.170
Um,I'll be right there.

31:33.170 --> 31:34.490
All right.

31:34.490 --> 31:36.420
let me call you back.

31:53.490 --> 31:54.920
Ma'am.

31:59.030 --> 32:00.840
Mr.Taylor?

32:01.200 --> 32:02.970
This is quite a surprise.

32:02.970 --> 32:04.390
How are you?

32:04.390 --> 32:07.120
I wanted to have a word with you,sam,in private.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.100
Of course.

32:10.360 --> 32:14.770
I'm-I'm really sorry we haven't spoken since roger's funeral.

32:14.770 --> 32:17.920
It's just...it's been so difficult for me.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.600
I know about the money,sam.

32:20.600 --> 32:21.470
Excuse me?

32:21.470 --> 32:27.460
$400,000 wired to an offshore account in the cayman islands three days after you found my son's body.

32:27.460 --> 32:29.270
There's no point in denying it.

32:29.270 --> 32:31.730
I just want to know who paid you and why.

32:31.730 --> 32:33.950
-Paid me?
-You know something about my son's death,

32:33.950 --> 32:36.010
and somebody's paid you to keep quiet about it.

32:36.010 --> 32:38.050
Mr.Taylor,that is just not true.

32:38.050 --> 32:41.900
Please,just answer the question!

32:49.090 --> 32:50.830
The money...

32:50.830 --> 32:52.400
it...

32:52.400 --> 32:55.230
-it isn't mine.
-What do you mean,it's not yours?

32:55.230 --> 32:57.380
It belongs to my aunt.

32:57.380 --> 33:01.450
She's had financial difficulties since my uncle passed away last year.

33:01.450 --> 33:03.490
It's from his divested real estate holdings.

33:03.490 --> 33:08.010
I suggested she move it to an offshore account to hide it from the irs.

33:08.010 --> 33:13.350
You want me to believe you had the presence of mind to commit tax fraud three days after my son died,

33:13.350 --> 33:16.340
the man you supposedly loved?

33:16.340 --> 33:19.090
I did love him.

33:19.730 --> 33:21.790
And I'm telling you the truth.

33:21.790 --> 33:23.240
You have to believe me.

33:23.240 --> 33:26.070
I don'T.

33:26.070 --> 33:28.500
You're lying.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.600
Well,if that's what you think then we have nothing left to talk about...

33:30.600 --> 33:32.390
you're not going anywhere till I get the truth.

33:32.390 --> 33:33.560
Let go of me.

33:33.560 --> 33:34.590
Sir!

33:34.590 --> 33:36.450
You know who murdered my son.

33:36.450 --> 33:39.150
No one murdered him.

33:39.150 --> 33:41.740
He killed himself.

33:41.740 --> 33:43.280
Mr.Taylor,we need to go.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.330
Right now.

33:44.330 --> 33:46.060
I'm going to find out what you're hiding,

33:46.060 --> 33:49.770
and when I do,god help you.

33:59.680 --> 34:00.770
tanner.

34:00.770 --> 34:01.580
I'm out.

34:01.580 --> 34:02.440
Copy that.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.980
Emerson spoke to his man inside the bureau.

34:03.980 --> 34:04.770
He says you're clear.

34:04.770 --> 34:05.910
Good.

34:05.910 --> 34:08.900
Look,I need to prep my men on the next job so why don't you tell me what we need.

34:08.900 --> 34:11.290
I'll give you the specs when I get there.

34:11.290 --> 34:12.370
Where are you?

34:12.370 --> 34:14.330
I'm just pulling in right now.

34:14.330 --> 34:16.199
We'll be standing by.

34:22.350 --> 34:23.540
When tanner gets here,we'll take off.

34:23.540 --> 34:27.290
Why don't you start the deletion program while we pack up?

34:43.320 --> 34:46.350
Damn it.We can't go any farther.He'll make us.Hold on.

35:05.290 --> 35:08.170
agent walker,we need to go!

35:09.260 --> 35:11.870
Here.You're going to need this.

35:12.700 --> 35:14.210
Thank you.

35:17.460 --> 35:19.770
I'll engage him.Cover my flank.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.640
I can handle it.

35:26.980 --> 35:29.280
Okay,let's go.Now.

36:00.480 --> 36:01.950
put the weapon down.

36:01.950 --> 36:03.760
Now!

36:07.460 --> 36:09.480
is tony almeida on the boat?

36:09.480 --> 36:11.160
Is tony almeida on the boat?

36:11.160 --> 36:13.380
I don't know.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.230
jack!It doesn't matter.

36:16.230 --> 36:17.420
Almeida's not the priority.

36:17.420 --> 36:18.240
The device is.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.170
We have to go in now.

36:59.090 --> 37:00.940
surveillance camera went out.

37:00.940 --> 37:03.040
Go check it out.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.690
cover me.

38:28.790 --> 38:29.940
Deletion Complete

38:29.940 --> 38:31.760
damn it!

39:24.580 --> 39:25.640
Tony!

39:25.640 --> 39:27.770
Stop!

39:37.550 --> 39:39.090
Damn it.

40:02.970 --> 40:04.700
the device is gone.

40:04.700 --> 40:06.330
The locator files have been deleted.

40:06.330 --> 40:08.960
Where is it?

40:18.570 --> 40:19.980
okay.

40:35.300 --> 40:38.040
What happened to you?

40:40.530 --> 40:42.930
What the hell happened to you?

40:43.305 --> 40:49.180
