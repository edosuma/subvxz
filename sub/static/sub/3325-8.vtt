00:02.295 --> 00:04.286
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:04.505 --> 00:06.041
You don't know me.

00:06.299 --> 00:08.415
You don't know anything about me.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.295
That was Derek Hale.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.548
His family. They all burned to death
in a fire, like, ten years ago.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.140
Is this your house?

00:15.349 --> 00:16.304
It was.

00:17.477 --> 00:19.092
- Who were they?
- Hunters.

00:19.312 --> 00:20.472
The kind that have been
hunting us for centuries.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.894
We kill them all.

00:22.315 --> 00:24.146
It's our sign for
a vendetta, for revenge.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.814
Someone is going to die tonight.

00:29.489 --> 00:30.569
No.

00:32.492 --> 00:35.279
Everyone around me gets hurt.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.905
You're a Hale, aren't you?

01:41.018 --> 01:42.178
Is this the one?

01:42.436 --> 01:44.301
Killed two of ours.

01:44.522 --> 01:45.762
Find the others.

01:45.982 --> 01:48.348
Bring them back alive. Alive.

01:48.568 --> 01:49.978
We go by the code.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.873
They were there for two days.

02:14.719 --> 02:16.459
Waiting, hiding.

02:17.221 --> 02:19.462
That's what we're taught to do
when the hunters find us.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.632
Hide and heal.

02:23.269 --> 02:25.601
Okay, so is two days standard then?

02:25.813 --> 02:28.646
Or are we thinking
Derek's on, like, some extended getaway?

02:29.483 --> 02:30.734
Why do you care?

02:30.943 --> 02:31.898
Why do I care? Let's see,

02:32.069 --> 02:34.731
because over the last few weeks,
my best friend's tried to kill himself,

02:34.947 --> 02:36.983
his boss nearly got ritually sacrificed,

02:37.158 --> 02:41.276
a girl that I've known since I was
three was ritually sacrificed.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.360
Boyd was killed by Alphas.

02:43.581 --> 02:46.618
You want me to keep going?
'Cause I can, all right?

02:46.834 --> 02:47.994
For, like, an hour.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.292
You think Derek can
do anything about that?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.244
Well, since
he's the one everyone seems to be after,

02:52.465 --> 02:54.296
it's more like he should
do something about it. Yeah.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.295
I don't know.
There's something different about him now.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.967
He wasn't like this when I knew him.

02:59.722 --> 03:01.258
What was he like?

03:06.020 --> 03:08.306
A lot like Scott, actually.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.607
A lot like most teenagers.

03:10.816 --> 03:14.274
Unbearably romantic,
profoundly narcissistic...

03:14.487 --> 03:17.274
Tolerable really only to other teenagers.

03:17.448 --> 03:19.404
And so what happened? What changed him?

03:21.619 --> 03:25.282
Well, the same thing
that changes a lot of young men.

03:25.498 --> 03:26.453
A girl.

03:26.666 --> 03:29.373
You're telling me some girl
broke his little heart?

03:29.585 --> 03:31.246
That's why Derek is the way he is?

03:31.504 --> 03:33.290
Do you remember Derek
before he was an Alpha

03:33.506 --> 03:34.712
had blue eyes?

03:34.924 --> 03:37.882
Do you know why some
wolves have blue eyes?

03:38.094 --> 03:40.005
| just always thought
it was, like, a genetic thing.

03:40.179 --> 03:42.465
If you want to know what changed Derek,

03:43.516 --> 03:46.553
you need to know what changed
the color of his eyes.

03:54.485 --> 03:56.100
Did you bring him?

04:01.909 --> 04:03.069
Oh.

04:03.494 --> 04:05.030
Come in, Scott,

04:05.788 --> 04:09.280
and give an old man
a little something for his pain.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.494
You don't have to do this.

04:11.711 --> 04:15.203
It you want me to
talk, this is how it's gonna happen.

04:18.509 --> 04:21.091
It I do this,
you have to tell us everything you know.

04:21.512 --> 04:22.547
Everything.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.941
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

06:01.821 --> 06:03.436
Hey, do you guys mind?

06:07.076 --> 06:08.407
I'm trying to practice.

06:08.577 --> 06:09.566
Ooh!

06:09.787 --> 06:11.652
How do you know
we're not trying to practice here, too?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.863
Yeah, well, see, I was
practicing in the music room,

06:14.083 --> 06:15.368
and I'm pretty sure basketball practice

06:15.543 --> 06:16.749
takes place in the gym.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.826
Well, I'm pretty sure basketball practice

06:19.046 --> 06:20.832
takes place anywhere you got a basketball.

06:24.844 --> 06:26.175
See?

06:27.221 --> 06:29.177
Hey, hold on, hold on.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.719
If you get the ball from me,

06:33.519 --> 06:35.384
maybe I'll stop.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.144
Come on.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.436
It'll be easy.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.427
Come on, lover boy.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.260
Sorry about that.

07:22.484 --> 07:23.985
Whatever.

07:25.321 --> 07:26.561
Hey, what's your name?

07:27.489 --> 07:29.525
I'm trying to practice, if you didn't notice.

07:29.783 --> 07:30.943
Okay.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.199
I'll just leave you alone then.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.870
After you tell me your name.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.953
All right, I'll tell you my name.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.706
If you can play one instrument in this room.

07:44.048 --> 07:45.663
- One?
- Just one.

07:45.883 --> 07:47.464
Any of them?

08:15.287 --> 08:17.027
My name is Paige.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.749
Now please go, so I can practice.

08:20.793 --> 08:23.455
- My name's...
- I know who you are.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.506
They found a third body?

08:36.684 --> 08:38.424
Another doctor,
right after Scott found Deaton.

08:38.644 --> 08:39.850
Right after?

08:40.062 --> 08:43.554
Almost like it was expected he'd survive.

08:44.316 --> 08:45.476
What's that supposed to mean?

08:45.693 --> 08:51.063
How do you know your Dark Druid
isn't your wise veterinarian himself?

08:54.535 --> 08:56.116
Maybe he planned it that way.

08:56.328 --> 08:58.239
He would never let anyone innocent die.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.444
Don't be so sure.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.873
You'd be surprised
how far some people would go

09:03.085 --> 09:06.202
to get rid of someone like Deucalion.

09:06.422 --> 09:08.128
Or someone like you?

09:09.883 --> 09:13.421
I don't go easily, though, do I?

09:14.430 --> 09:18.423
You know, Scott, you've made me
something of a celebrity here.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.558
I'm a medical mystery.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.307
The cancer is now virtually undetectable,

09:24.523 --> 09:29.142
but the doctors have no clue
why my body keeps producing and ejecting

09:29.361 --> 09:33.730
this bizarre black fluid.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.032
I did what you wanted me to do.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.609
Tell us how to beat him.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.611
You can't.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.165
I've tried.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.242
Then this is a complete waste of time.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.129
He doesn't know anything.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.044
Sorry you did this. Let's go.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.247
Wait.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.922
I can tell you one thing.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.555
Deucalion may have lost his eyes,

10:01.518 --> 10:04.100
but he's not always blind.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.690
Okay, so if Derek
was a sophomore back then,

10:13.864 --> 10:15.149
how old was he?

10:15.365 --> 10:17.151
How old were you?

10:17.659 --> 10:18.694
How old are you now?

10:18.911 --> 10:21.823
Not as young as we could have been,
but not as old as you might think.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.870
Okay, that was frustratingly vague.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.243
How old are you?

10:25.459 --> 10:27.165
- I'm 17.
- See, that's an answer.

10:27.377 --> 10:30.289
- That's how we answer people.
- Well, 17 how you'd measure in years.

10:30.506 --> 10:31.791
All right, I'm just gonna drop it.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.417
What happened to Derek and the cello girl?

10:33.634 --> 10:35.170
What do you think happened?

10:35.385 --> 10:36.340
They're teenagers.

10:36.512 --> 10:39.299
One minute, it's,
"I hate you, don't talk to me."

10:39.515 --> 10:42.803
The next,
it's frantic groping in any dark corner

10:43.018 --> 10:46.010
they could manage to
find themselves alone in for five minutes.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.230
Their favorite dark corner
was an abandoned distillery

10:50.442 --> 10:51.682
outside of Beacon Hills.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.906
All right, hold up.

11:00.244 --> 11:02.860
How do you know all this?
You just said that they were alone.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.116
Back then, I wasn'tjust Derek's uncle.

11:05.332 --> 11:09.245
l was his best friend.
His closest confidante.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.292
That's how I know.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.263
What?

11:22.099 --> 11:23.464
Why do you like me?

11:24.309 --> 11:25.685
What's that supposed to mean?

11:27.521 --> 11:28.852
Why do you like me?

11:29.481 --> 11:31.221
Why do you think I like you?

11:32.484 --> 11:34.440
Honestly, I think, at first,

11:34.653 --> 11:37.395
you liked me because I didn't like you.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.860
So now you're worried

11:41.076 --> 11:43.909
that now that I know you like me

11:44.121 --> 11:46.453
that I'm gonna stop liking you?

11:47.249 --> 11:48.489
Not worried.

11:49.418 --> 11:50.783
Just wondering when.

11:53.589 --> 11:55.454
What if I never stop liking you?

12:00.304 --> 12:01.464
What?

12:02.139 --> 12:03.470
Did you hear something?

12:06.226 --> 12:07.432
Hey, what's wrong?

12:07.644 --> 12:09.430
Something happened here.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.307
What do you mean?

12:11.523 --> 12:13.980
I caught a scent. It's blood.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.818
All right, now I definitely heard something.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.775
Derek, I don't hear anything.

12:20.991 --> 12:23.448
We have to go. Come on. Let's go.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.374
There.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.301
You see it?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.430
They dragged him here,

12:47.643 --> 12:49.179
an arrow in his throat,

12:49.603 --> 12:52.015
and they hung him and cut him in half.

12:52.231 --> 12:53.641
They killed one of ours.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.438
One of yours.

12:56.193 --> 12:58.354
Why should I care about one of your pack?

12:58.570 --> 13:02.108
'Cause the hunters don't discern packs.

13:02.324 --> 13:03.609
Especially the Argents.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.486
But they do discern motive.

13:05.827 --> 13:08.443
Ennis, why did they kill him?

13:08.664 --> 13:12.577
Because your young,
naive Beta killed one of them.

13:12.751 --> 13:13.991
Marco.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.418
He killed a hunter, didn't he?

13:17.506 --> 13:19.042
Accidentally.

13:20.259 --> 13:21.590
They were all there.

13:21.802 --> 13:25.761
Ennis, Kali, Deucalion.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.177
Each with their own packs,

13:29.393 --> 13:31.304
before they'd killed them all

13:31.520 --> 13:34.557
and decided to form
their little all-star team.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.013
But they didn't all live here, did they?

13:36.233 --> 13:40.192
No, but there
was an exceptionally powerful Alpha

13:40.404 --> 13:41.564
who did live here.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.899
She had a capacity to shape-shift

13:44.116 --> 13:45.981
that was rare among her kind.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.316
That made her something of a leader,

13:48.537 --> 13:53.452
the kind of person that they would go
to for advice and guidance.

14:32.497 --> 14:33.998
Talia Hale.

14:42.507 --> 14:43.667
It's his right.

14:43.884 --> 14:47.092
We're not the only people
to adhere to rituals thousands of years old.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.295
Which is no excuse for not evolving.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.766
They ripped his claws
right out of his fingers.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.549
How is that evolving?

14:54.269 --> 14:55.634
Useless debate.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.182
I'm done with it.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.102
Ennis, don't.

15:01.485 --> 15:04.318
Don't make us part of a historical cliche.

15:04.529 --> 15:07.987
With two such powers,
it never ends at an eye for an eye.

15:08.158 --> 15:10.695
A skirmish becomes a war.
Murder becomes a massacre.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.573
And we end up no better than our enemies.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.139
Our mark for vendetta.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.315
Man, you guys really
take that revenge thing

15:44.528 --> 15:46.689
to, like, a whole new level, don't you?

15:47.489 --> 15:49.229
It's notjust revenge.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.065
Losing a member of your pack
isn't like losing family.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.109
It's like you lose a limb.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.452
They wouldn't even let him see the body.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.373
Somebody called for a...

16:02.838 --> 16:03.793
Whoa.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.292
I want his body.

16:06.508 --> 16:09.090
It belongs to me. Both halves.

16:11.513 --> 16:12.719
First off,

16:12.931 --> 16:14.717
you need to step back.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.303
I'm just a deputy.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.806
I do what I'm told.
And right now they're telling me

16:21.022 --> 16:23.183
there's a young man
who was shot in the throat with an arrow

16:23.400 --> 16:24.515
and literally cut in half.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.349
This is a homicide investigation.

16:26.570 --> 16:29.403
Second, no matter how close you were,

16:30.407 --> 16:31.613
you're not related.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.694
He was family to me.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.193
I don't get it.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.491
What does this have to do with Derek?

16:39.875 --> 16:41.285
Everything.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.708
It's neverjust a single moment.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.831
It's a confluence of events.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.380
Personally, I looked at Ennis' circumstances,

16:48.592 --> 16:50.503
I saw a profound loss.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.217
Derek saw something different.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.887
He saw opportunity.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.014
Opportunity to do what?

16:58.977 --> 17:00.683
To always be with her.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.091
What are you staring at?

17:38.892 --> 17:40.803
I'm not staring.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.304
I'm listening.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.940
Am I distracting you?

17:46.149 --> 17:48.811
No, I've got laser-like focus.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.440
You sure about that?

18:24.145 --> 18:25.521
I hate you.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.311
No, you don't.

18:28.483 --> 18:30.019
You love me.

18:31.319 --> 18:32.434
Hate you.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.282
You love me?

18:53.216 --> 18:55.593
The thing was, he had this constant fear.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.010
He was obsessing over it,
thinking about it all night, all day.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.053
Always on his mind.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.101
Why does she eat alone?

19:15.322 --> 19:16.687
What are you doing here?

19:16.906 --> 19:18.567
I'm looking out for my favorite nephew,

19:18.742 --> 19:21.233
making sure no one
has a crossbow aimed at your throat.

19:21.453 --> 19:23.068
I could get you banned from school grounds.

19:23.288 --> 19:24.243
You know that, right?

19:24.456 --> 19:26.447
No one would ban me from anywhere.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.372
I'm too good-looking.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.872
Doesn't she have any friends?

19:32.088 --> 19:35.251
A few. But she likes to study during lunch.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.958
And I kind ofjust don't
think she likes my friends.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.419
No one should like your friends.

19:40.639 --> 19:42.755
They're a bunch of hormonal half-wits.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.351
But that one over there,
she's perfect for you.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.472
And perfect combinations are
rare in an imperfect world.

19:52.484 --> 19:54.190
It would worry me too, though.

19:54.361 --> 19:57.228
I'd probably be thinking about it all the time.

19:57.489 --> 19:59.195
Thinking about what?

19:59.574 --> 20:01.940
Her finding out.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.902
You've thought that through, right?

20:05.455 --> 20:06.740
You know it always happens.

20:06.956 --> 20:10.289
One minute, you're in
this blissful teen romance,

20:10.502 --> 20:14.040
and next, she sees fangs,
glowing eyes, claws.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.798
She doesn't have to find out.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.255
But they always do.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.338
Especially when they're perfect for you.

20:21.596 --> 20:26.090
There's really only one way to make
sure you'll always be together.

20:28.645 --> 20:29.600
Turn her.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.983
I kept telling him not to do it.

20:42.534 --> 20:46.447
Every day the more he thought about
it, the more convinced he became.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.404
You know teenagers.

20:49.624 --> 20:51.706
I bet he even blames me.

20:53.503 --> 20:57.212
He's probably convinced himself
the whole thing was my idea.

20:58.508 --> 21:00.339
l have the perfect idea.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.000
Go away.

21:02.220 --> 21:05.337
Laura told you
about the packs being here, right?

21:05.515 --> 21:09.007
There are more Alphas than
I've ever seen in one place.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.347
Your mother would never do it.

21:12.522 --> 21:15.138
And these packs won't be here much longer.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.734
The time to do it is now.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.193
One little bite,

21:20.488 --> 21:22.149
and she never gets sick again.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.606
She stays younger, more beautiful.

21:25.744 --> 21:27.905
Think how she'll be
able to protect herself.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.452
Derek,

21:30.540 --> 21:33.202
the bite is a gift.

21:44.512 --> 21:45.763
What is that?

21:50.935 --> 21:54.177
A Celtic
five-fold knot. It's a Druid symbol.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.934
The air's different in here. Do you feel it?

21:58.735 --> 22:01.101
I think I know what this place is.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.401
Is that blood?

22:02.614 --> 22:03.945
Sacrificial blood.

22:05.366 --> 22:07.072
We're in a Nemeton.

22:08.870 --> 22:11.327
It's a sacred meeting place.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.580
Ancient Celtic Druids would usually choose

22:13.833 --> 22:16.074
a large, older tree in a grove,

22:16.503 --> 22:18.334
represent the center of the world.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.918
There was a belief
that cutting or harming the tree in any way

22:22.133 --> 22:24.419
would cause serious
problems for the surrounding villages.

22:24.636 --> 22:26.752
What sort of problems?

22:26.971 --> 22:29.428
Fires, plagues, strife.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.974
Death and destruction of all kinds.

22:34.145 --> 22:38.309
How does he know all about
Celtic symbols and Druids?

22:39.442 --> 22:41.433
Know thy enemy, Allison.

22:42.195 --> 22:45.437
The older wolves had
a relationship with the Druids.

22:46.491 --> 22:48.447
They called them emissaries.

22:49.994 --> 22:51.825
Like my boss, Deaton.

22:54.916 --> 22:57.453
Do you know the myth of Lycaon?

22:58.753 --> 23:00.914
I know it's where
we get the word lycanthropy.

23:01.130 --> 23:04.588
According to myth,
some Greek citizens believed

23:04.801 --> 23:07.292
they owed their lives more to Prometheus

23:07.512 --> 23:09.298
than to the gods of Olympus.

23:09.514 --> 23:11.675
And some followers even took names

23:11.891 --> 23:14.633
to honor the Titans instead of the gods.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.596
Like Deucalion.

23:17.564 --> 23:20.271
The son of Prometheus.

23:21.109 --> 23:24.272
Lycaon didn't just refuse to honor the gods.

23:24.487 --> 23:26.102
He challenged them.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.028
He invited Zeus to a banquet

23:28.241 --> 23:31.483
and then tried to serve him
the flesh of a human being.

23:31.661 --> 23:35.904
Angered, Zeus blew the place
apart with lightning bolts

23:36.124 --> 23:38.490
and then punished Lycaon and his sons

23:38.710 --> 23:41.702
by turning them into wolves.

23:42.714 --> 23:45.421
The part that's lesser known is

23:45.633 --> 23:48.045
how Lycaon sought out the Druids

23:48.261 --> 23:50.798
to help turn him back to human.

23:51.723 --> 23:53.054
Why Druids?

23:53.266 --> 23:57.179
The belief was that
the ancient Druids knew how to shape-shift.

23:57.395 --> 24:00.262
They couldn't make Lycaon
and his sons human again,

24:00.481 --> 24:05.441
but they did teach them
how to shift back and forth.

24:07.697 --> 24:12.612
And so the Druids
became important advisors to the packs.

24:14.746 --> 24:17.533
They keep us connected to humanity.

24:18.499 --> 24:20.205
But they're a secret even in the pack.

24:20.418 --> 24:23.080
Sometimes only the Alpha
knows who the emissary is.

24:23.296 --> 24:25.161
Derek and I had no idea about Deaton.

24:25.632 --> 24:28.294
Or his sister, Morell.

24:28.509 --> 24:29.840
She's an emissary, too?

24:30.053 --> 24:31.293
For the Alpha pack.

24:31.512 --> 24:32.592
Our guidance counselor?

24:34.432 --> 24:36.514
Why the hell don't
you people tell me any of this stuff, huh?

24:36.684 --> 24:39.517
I shared some really
intimate details with her.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.143
And did she give you good advice?

24:42.523 --> 24:43.854
Actually, yeah.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.273
That's what they do.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.067
That's what Deaton used to do for Talia.

24:48.488 --> 24:50.729
While I admire
your willingness to extend an olive branch,

24:50.949 --> 24:52.485
l have to tell you, it might not be welcome.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.691
And I'm not sure
that Gerard is the one to accept it.

24:54.911 --> 24:57.277
It's true.
The Argents have a matriarchal leadership.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.203
Actually,
I was speaking about the fact

24:59.415 --> 25:01.155
that he's a complete psychopath.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.662
I mean, the man cuts people in
half with a broad sword.

25:03.878 --> 25:06.620
Do the two of you really have
so little faith in people?

25:06.839 --> 25:10.047
You think Gerard isn't
worried about the deaths on his own side?

25:10.259 --> 25:12.716
Do you know the story
of the scorpion and the frog?

25:13.638 --> 25:15.720
l have a feeling I'm about to hear it.

25:15.932 --> 25:18.548
When the scorpion
asked the frog to carry him across the river,

25:18.768 --> 25:20.975
the frog said,
"How do I know you won't sting me?"

25:21.187 --> 25:24.350
The scorpion replied, "Why would I do
that? Then we'd both drown."

25:24.565 --> 25:25.771
So the frog agreed.

25:25.984 --> 25:28.851
Halfway across the river,
the scorpion stung the frog.

25:29.070 --> 25:32.483
When the frog asked him why he did it,
since now they would both die,

25:32.699 --> 25:34.530
the scorpion replied,

25:35.702 --> 25:36.942
"It's my nature."

25:37.578 --> 25:41.992
Your faith in humanity may not matter
if you underestimate Gerard's nature.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.449
Make sure you meet him on neutral ground.

25:44.669 --> 25:46.284
And do not walk in there alone.

25:46.504 --> 25:48.369
I'm an Alpha.

25:48.589 --> 25:50.545
I never walk alone.

26:01.477 --> 26:02.762
Derek?

26:07.567 --> 26:09.523
Derek, is that you?

27:14.509 --> 27:15.669
Ennis?

27:16.094 --> 27:17.925
Why would you choose him?

27:18.679 --> 27:20.340
Why not?

27:21.349 --> 27:23.465
Ennis needed a new member for his pack.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.470
Paige was young and strong.

27:25.686 --> 27:28.814
Doing a favor for Derek
meant Ennis would be in good with Talia.

27:28.981 --> 27:32.565
Back then, everybody wanted
to be in good with her.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.947
He doesn't remember
it was Ennis, does he?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.946
If he does, he keeps it to himself.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.119
So then what happened?

27:50.002 --> 27:51.082
Did he turn her?

27:51.629 --> 27:52.914
Almost.

28:06.936 --> 28:08.551
He came at Ennis.

28:09.856 --> 28:14.395
A 15-year-old boy against a giant.

28:27.415 --> 28:29.622
There was no reason for him to fight.

28:34.338 --> 28:36.499
She'd already been bitten.

28:52.356 --> 28:55.348
I wasn't really surprised when Deaton came

28:55.568 --> 28:58.480
to arrange a meeting with Deucalion.

28:58.696 --> 29:00.732
As William Blake said,

29:00.948 --> 29:04.406
"Any sinister person
who means to be your enemy

29:04.619 --> 29:08.988
"always starts by trying
to become your friend."

29:09.207 --> 29:11.448
How do you know he wasn't
going there to make peace?

29:12.376 --> 29:14.332
Because I'm not an idiot.

29:15.129 --> 29:19.293
Do you know the Sanskrit
table of the scorpion and the turtle?

29:20.801 --> 29:23.838
The scorpion asks
the turtle for a ride across the river.

29:24.013 --> 29:28.382
And when the scorpion
stings the turtle, dooming them both,

29:28.601 --> 29:31.183
what does he say to explain his behavior?

29:32.980 --> 29:34.516
"It's my nature."

29:35.816 --> 29:38.023
I know a werewolf's nature.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.525
I knew exactly what was coming.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.528
A trap.

29:45.451 --> 29:49.615
I think it's quite
fitting that we are meeting in a distillery.

29:51.207 --> 29:53.493
You know, the process of distillation

29:53.709 --> 29:56.200
is the separating of two substances

29:56.420 --> 29:59.457
by pushing them into
their different volatile states.

29:59.674 --> 30:03.166
Volatile is exactly
the state l was hoping to avoid.

30:03.886 --> 30:04.966
Ooh.

30:07.056 --> 30:09.638
Then this is going
to come as quite a big disappointment.

30:21.570 --> 30:22.855
What have you done?

30:24.573 --> 30:25.824
They attacked you?

30:26.033 --> 30:27.739
It was an ambush.

30:31.247 --> 30:35.365
One of the earliest
weapons used by man was the spiked mace.

30:35.793 --> 30:37.909
I've made one of my own.

30:38.087 --> 30:40.544
I'd love to get your opinion on it.

30:53.602 --> 30:54.762
Your own people.

31:02.570 --> 31:05.312
They wanted peace, too.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.943
Look what you did to them.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.989
So did she turn?

31:18.127 --> 31:19.367
She should have.

31:20.755 --> 31:22.837
Most of the time, the bite takes.

31:24.091 --> 31:25.251
Most of the time.

31:26.469 --> 31:30.382
When you offered it
to me, you said, "If it doesn't kill you..."

31:42.568 --> 31:44.399
What's happening to her?

31:47.031 --> 31:49.022
He knew the answer, though.

31:50.117 --> 31:53.109
It didn't matter
that she was young and strong.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.741
Some people just aren't made for this.

31:59.752 --> 32:01.492
She fought.

32:01.712 --> 32:04.169
She struggled desperately.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.626
Trying to survive.

32:22.650 --> 32:23.765
Don't.

32:23.984 --> 32:25.315
Don't do this.

32:25.903 --> 32:28.645
I had a vision, a vision of peace.

32:30.241 --> 32:31.981
A little shortsighted,

32:33.744 --> 32:35.530
wouldn't you say?

33:16.620 --> 33:18.201
I'm sorry.

33:19.582 --> 33:20.947
I knew.

33:22.835 --> 33:24.541
What do you mean?

33:25.713 --> 33:29.547
Right after I
told you my name, | thinkl knew.

33:30.593 --> 33:35.553
I've seen things in this town before.
Things no one really could explain.

33:37.558 --> 33:40.391
And then there's the way that you talk.

33:40.603 --> 33:44.266
How you say things,
like how you'd "catch a scent."

33:47.485 --> 33:49.601
And I know you can hear things.

33:50.571 --> 33:53.028
Things that no one else can hear.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.486
I knew.

33:58.496 --> 33:59.906
And you still liked me?

34:01.665 --> 34:03.201
I loved you.

34:26.148 --> 34:28.890
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

34:37.159 --> 34:38.535
I can't.

34:39.453 --> 34:41.239
I can't take it anymore.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.619
Derek, I can't.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.493
Derek.

34:48.546 --> 34:49.752
Please.

34:53.592 --> 34:54.877
Please.

35:07.273 --> 35:08.604
I'm sorry.

35:23.581 --> 35:24.912
I'm sorry.

35:35.593 --> 35:38.710
I remember taking
her body from his arms,

35:38.929 --> 35:42.421
to the woods, to a place where
I knew that it would be found.

35:44.268 --> 35:47.726
Another in a long line
of Beacon Hills animal attacks.

35:48.981 --> 35:50.721
And what about Derek?

35:51.150 --> 35:53.516
Taking an innocent life takes

35:54.236 --> 35:56.522
something from you as well.

35:57.531 --> 35:59.112
Bit of your soul.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.565
Darkening it.

36:02.578 --> 36:06.662
Dimming the once brilliant, golden yellow

36:08.083 --> 36:12.452
to a cold, steel blue.

36:13.881 --> 36:15.542
Like mine.

36:25.601 --> 36:27.057
I'm sorry.

36:27.269 --> 36:29.681
The eyes will heal physically.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.971
But your sight is...

36:42.451 --> 36:43.531
Leave me alone.

36:49.667 --> 36:52.283
Marco, I said

36:53.337 --> 36:56.545
leave me alone.

36:57.591 --> 36:59.206
You are alone.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.527
He sees as a wolf?

37:25.577 --> 37:28.114
He's not always blind.

37:29.289 --> 37:30.870
Maybe we can use it against him.

37:33.585 --> 37:34.916
Scott.

37:56.066 --> 38:00.275
Oh, God, I think
about you sometimes, Scott.

38:00.571 --> 38:01.526
I do.

38:01.739 --> 38:04.526
I wonder, what if I'd done things differently?

38:04.992 --> 38:07.358
Getting the bite to cure my cancer.

38:07.703 --> 38:10.911
And I wonder when it became my nature

38:11.123 --> 38:14.240
to believe most things couldn't be asked for

38:14.460 --> 38:16.166
but had to be taken.

38:19.631 --> 38:20.791
I don't believe you.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.419
The whole time that you
were telling your story,

38:23.594 --> 38:25.300
l was listening to your heartbeat.

38:25.721 --> 38:27.507
It never went up.

38:27.931 --> 38:29.546
It never went down.

38:30.434 --> 38:32.345
It was steady the whole time.

38:32.603 --> 38:34.764
Because I was telling the truth.

38:35.439 --> 38:37.304
Or because you're a really good liar.

38:45.199 --> 38:47.906
If you lied and it gets people hurt,

38:49.828 --> 38:51.329
I'll be back

38:51.955 --> 38:54.947
to take away
more than your pain.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.259
What?

39:10.599 --> 39:13.557
What's this look on your face?

39:14.061 --> 39:15.096
What look?

39:16.230 --> 39:18.061
The kind of look that
makes me wanna punch you.

39:18.273 --> 39:21.185
Oh, my God.
You are so Derek's sister. I forgot.

39:21.401 --> 39:22.607
What is with the look?

39:24.071 --> 39:25.686
ljust don't believe him.

39:26.657 --> 39:29.239
All right, in Ms. Blake's class
we're reading "Heart of Darkness."

39:29.409 --> 39:31.536
And it's in first person, right?
Narrated by Marlow.

39:31.745 --> 39:34.361
The thing is that he's an unreliable narrator.

39:34.581 --> 39:37.789
You know the details of it have changed,
you know, just because of his perspective.

39:38.001 --> 39:39.741
Well, then we heard the story
from Peter's perspective.

39:39.962 --> 39:41.998
Right, and I don't think
we got the whole story.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.330
So, what? Are you just gonna ask Derek

39:44.550 --> 39:47.667
about the girl he fell in love with

39:47.886 --> 39:49.626
and then killed?

39:50.514 --> 39:52.129
If I have to,

39:53.600 --> 39:54.806
yeah.

40:08.574 --> 40:09.814
Derek.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.023
I did something,

40:12.244 --> 40:13.529
something terrible.

40:16.707 --> 40:18.072
I know.

40:23.255 --> 40:24.540
My eyes.

40:26.425 --> 40:27.631
They're different.

40:29.595 --> 40:32.553
Different, but still beautiful.

40:34.808 --> 40:36.764
Just like the rest of you.
