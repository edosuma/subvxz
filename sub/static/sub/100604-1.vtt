00:58.391 --> 00:59.893
<i>...element of surprise is</i>

00:59.976 --> 01:01.644
<i>the only tactic Gordon
Brown has left.</i>

01:01.770 --> 01:03.521
<i>We'll be going live to Parliament.</i>

01:03.688 --> 01:07.192
<i>But first, more British troops
are being deployed to Afghanistan</i>

01:07.275 --> 01:08.985
<i>as part of the biggest
joint offensive...</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:10.862
<i>...since the 2001 invasion.</i>

01:11.529 --> 01:13.698
<i>The British Army's death toll
has already exceeded</i>

01:13.782 --> 01:15.825
<i>that of Iraq and the Falklands War,</i>

01:15.909 --> 01:17.869
<i>with those wounded
and requiring treatment at home</i>

01:17.952 --> 01:19.496
<i>also rising sharply.</i>

01:19.829 --> 01:21.790
<i>Fatalities have ris...</i>

01:36.846 --> 01:37.847
ID, please.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.849
I just popped into town.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.898
Private Shaw.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.110
Can you tell the young private
who I am?

01:50.193 --> 01:51.194
Sorry, ma'am.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.904
Increased security
with the deployment tonight.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.908
I'm sure the MOD's very interested
in the Colonel's supper.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.085
What are you doing?
Wake up, yeah?

02:07.544 --> 02:08.628
Do you realise who that was?

02:08.837 --> 02:09.921
Just get some wine.

02:11.423 --> 02:12.632
Hello.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.177
Do we have any olive oil?

02:16.636 --> 02:19.264
Erm... we have oil.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.350
Oh.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.938
I went all the way into town,
then forgot it.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.526
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, that's very kind.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.987
Erm... All right.

02:34.070 --> 02:37.532
Whole new world for you this time,
Lisa, Sergeant-Major's wife.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.702
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.414
Lots of new responsibilities for you
with the wives.

02:44.497 --> 02:45.498
Yeah.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.084
I'm sure you've got lots of ideas
up your sleeve.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.338
- Oh, yeah.
- Planning is key.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.214
OK, well, thank you for the advice.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.632
Any time.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.536
You not done yet?

03:24.412 --> 03:25.830
Grace came over to say goodbye.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.958
- Oh, right. Where's she going?
- To live with her aunt off base.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.086
And have a life.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.589
There are positives
to being surrounded by people

03:34.673 --> 03:35.799
who are in the same boat as you.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.300
Mum, please don't.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.638
By the left! Left wheel!

03:49.437 --> 03:52.065
<i>He's coming
to get him. Rargh!</i>

03:53.858 --> 03:56.027
<i>Come on, Billy, story
time. Come on.</i>

03:57.112 --> 03:59.197
<i>Are you going
away tomorrow?</i>

03:59.447 --> 04:02.325
<i>I am, but only for a little bit,
though, OK?</i>

04:02.909 --> 04:05.787
<i>Who's gonna read stories
when you're away?</i>

04:13.712 --> 04:15.880
Oh, God, why are you so clumsy?

04:15.964 --> 04:19.342
Maybe this is God's way of telling
us to put it in a frame.

04:19.426 --> 04:22.220
- No, I like it on the fridge.
- It'd be better protected under glass.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.055
It would be frozen and formal.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.725
I prefer it where it lives,
on the fridge,

04:27.350 --> 04:30.645
in amongst my postcards
and my shopping lists and all my...

04:32.355 --> 04:33.565
my everyday things.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.775
Jamie always hated that photo.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.820
Said it made him look like
an American talk show host.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.197
Well, I like it.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.495
- Fine.
- Fine.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.548
Are you going to be
OK when I'm gone?

04:58.631 --> 04:59.674
Mm.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.010
I'll be fine. Of course I will.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.512
I mean, it's my fifth
tour.

05:05.055 --> 05:08.641
Yeah, but things are
completely different this time.

05:14.230 --> 05:18.360
Do you know? I think I'm going to
offer my help in supporting the wives.

05:18.943 --> 05:21.654
I don't trust that Lisa,
the new RSM's wife.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.782
She's very cavalier
about the whole thing.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.867
- I'm sure she has a plan.
- Mm.

05:27.911 --> 05:31.164
Not that she won't appreciate
your support as well.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.546
Look after Mummy.
If she gets upset, give her a hug.

05:38.963 --> 05:40.632
- I will.
- OK, good boy.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.760
This is gonna keep you safe
while I'm away.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.096
Just like mine'll keep me safe.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.016
Right, kids.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.769
OK, remember what
we do with this?

05:53.561 --> 05:55.855
- Cross it off every day.
- Yeah, until?

05:56.147 --> 05:58.525
- Daddy's home.
- And we are?

05:58.733 --> 05:59.776
- Chuffed.
- Chuffed.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.111
Chuffed, yeah.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.598
Yeah, I know.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.020
Check out the blast boxers.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.566
- Not funny, Red.
- What? They're Kevlar.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.610
I'm just protecting the family jewels
for your pleasure.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.696
- Who's she talking to?
- I don't know.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.198
Better not be talking to those lads.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.076
- I was a lad once, remember?
- Yeah, thanks.

06:50.618 --> 06:51.703
That's really helpful.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.663
Is that my razor?

06:54.831 --> 06:57.125
Are you packing my stuff up again
before I've left?

06:57.292 --> 06:58.293
No.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.837
Well, I'm taking this.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.381
- Why? You're not gonna read it.
- I am. It's about leadership.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.593
Fine. Last time you took
<i>War And Peace,</i>

07:06.676 --> 07:11.348
spent your whole time reading <i>Heat</i>
magazine and watching romcoms.

07:12.974 --> 07:13.975
Are you angry?

07:14.059 --> 07:16.102
No, I don't give a
shit what you read.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.230
I'm just getting ready for another
six months as a single mother.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.358
All right?

07:23.193 --> 07:25.403
There, you can
forget about me now.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.243
Just get off.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.289
Get off!

07:38.792 --> 07:39.918
Do you really want me to?

07:47.884 --> 07:48.885
No.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.689
Oh, shit!

08:09.489 --> 08:11.324
Yes.

08:13.785 --> 08:14.911
Listen, I've got to go.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.580
Yeah, OK, I'll speak to you later.
Bye-bye.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.461
You better write to me.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.755
And I mean proper letters,
not just emails.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.219
Come here.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.240
They've stopped doing
the jumbo crossword in the paper

08:52.323 --> 08:53.867
so I printed it off the net.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.329
No crossword?

09:01.458 --> 09:02.500
I've got to go.

09:04.336 --> 09:05.420
Right.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.747
Oh.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.999
- Hi, Kate.
- Hello, Lisa.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.211
I'm late for a meeting
with Crooks.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.839
- Forgot the clocks went forward.
- Oh.

09:50.674 --> 09:51.675
Well, don't worry about it.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.926
The Brigadier's
still in there with him.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.719
Oh, great. Great.

09:57.972 --> 09:58.973
Quite right.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.601
I imagine the spouses
are quite anxious.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.561
We all know what
to expect this time.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.147
- Who's your point person?
- Lisa Lawson is the RSM's wife, sir.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.483
She wasn't too chuffed to get the
job but I think she'll rise to it.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.402
These things don't
happen overnight.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.446
And Kate Barclay will help
with the pastoral care.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.824
- Kate will?
- Yes, sir. She volunteered.

10:15.907 --> 10:19.494
I think after losing Jamie on the last
tour, she's keen to keep occupied.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.329
Sorry to interrupt.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.415
- Kate.
- Hello, Jeremy.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.875
The Brigadier and I were
discussing the new welfare directives.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.128
Social activities,
getting the women on board.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.880
Top brass telling us what to do.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.882
I think I should leave you to it.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.434
- Oh...
- No, that's all right.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.561
Got it.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.148
Colonel Barclay's wife would like
to take a more active role

10:48.231 --> 10:50.150
in supporting the spouses
during this deployment.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.401
Oh!

10:52.193 --> 10:54.404
I know it's not customary
for the Colonel's wife

10:54.487 --> 10:55.905
to get her hands dirty...

10:55.989 --> 10:57.449
Yeah, exactly. That's my role.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.783
No, of course. Of course.

11:01.036 --> 11:05.540
So, erm... what do you have in
store in terms of social activities?

11:08.376 --> 11:09.836
Well, we have our coffee mornings.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.755
Coffee mornings, yeah.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.048
And?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.469
Pot luck parties.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.262
Oh, pot luck party?

11:19.679 --> 11:21.598
That's when everyone brings a dish
and gets drunk.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.434
Of course, we've got
my walk on the moors.

11:24.517 --> 11:28.021
With the greatest respect, Kate,
most women don't have a mess to drink in.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.023
They can't go into
town and get pissed

11:30.106 --> 11:31.941
so they need somewhere
to let off steam.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.360
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.694
Absolutely.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.823
Erm... so, anything else?

11:42.118 --> 11:45.538
Why don't we just brainstorm with
the women at the next coffee morning?

11:49.501 --> 11:50.669
Go and have a play, Bills.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.173
You can bring whatever
cakes you want.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.967
I'll just introduce you
to Annie and Helen.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.428
This is Sarah, Private
Wheeler's wife.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.722
- Just marched in yesterday.
- Are you settling in?

12:02.806 --> 12:06.559
Fine, yeah, except everyone
keeps asking me what rank I am.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.646
What the hell is that? They look like
squashed little turds.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.358
I think it's, erm...
Kate's contribution.

12:13.441 --> 12:16.361
Lisa seems to be running late.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.906
- She's here.
- Hey.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.408
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.786
- Would you like to come to the front?
- No, you're grand.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.579
You don't want to kick things off?

12:27.247 --> 12:28.456
Well, it has kicked off.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.128
What do people do
in these coffee mornings?

12:33.211 --> 12:35.672
I think they just... drink coffee.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.177
Sorry, everyone. Hello.

12:41.553 --> 12:45.098
If you'd all like to gather round
and take a seat.

12:45.223 --> 12:48.393
There's no need to be shy.
Front row's nice and empty.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.395
So, some of you don't know me.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.773
I'm Kate Barclay,
Colonel Barclay's wife.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.278
Today we need to come up with
some exciting activities and pursuits

12:58.403 --> 13:01.656
for us to do
while our service people are away.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.033
So, shall we start?

13:04.159 --> 13:06.536
Erm... Lisa? Lisa? Lisa?

13:07.871 --> 13:09.706
Do you think you could write things
on the board for me?

13:10.498 --> 13:11.541
Thank you.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.296
So...

13:17.172 --> 13:21.009
I thought we could have
a formal dinner once a month

13:21.092 --> 13:23.595
to explore all aspects
of global cuisine.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.727
Then perhaps the film night
could become a film season

13:30.810 --> 13:32.937
where we could examine
the body of an auteur

13:33.063 --> 13:35.982
and would provide an educational
aspect to leisure pursuits

13:36.066 --> 13:37.317
in a non-alcoholic environment.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.069
Non-alcoholic environment?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.197
- What's the matter?
- No, no.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.324
It's just in general,
when we watch films,

13:44.741 --> 13:47.619
you know,
usually we like them to be... fun.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.413
Perhaps open the ideas to the room?

13:50.663 --> 13:51.664
Yeah.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.627
Well, we did a book
club in Germany.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.253
Book club, great, great. Super.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.172
What about a footie club?

13:59.255 --> 14:02.425
We had a cracking five-a-side
in Aldershot, it was something else.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.511
Football! Yes, why not?

14:04.678 --> 14:07.222
- Start a needlework club.
- Needlework, right.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.224
Baking or bread-making.

14:09.307 --> 14:12.060
Yeah. Yeah, and then we could
collect alms for the poor

14:12.143 --> 14:14.062
and do a bit of basket weaving.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.065
It's all a bit <i>Little Women,</i> isn't it?

14:17.148 --> 14:19.192
Let's just get the strippers in.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.986
Give the rear party soldiers a case
of beer and have a Mr World contest.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.780
That'd be very entertaining.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.368
But, actually, right now,
we're looking for clubs to join.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.578
What about singing?

14:30.704 --> 14:31.788
Singing?

14:32.122 --> 14:34.916
My bridesmaids did <i>Angels</i> by
Robbie at my wedding.

14:35.458 --> 14:36.918
It was amazing.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.463
OK, erm... yeah. Super.

14:40.964 --> 14:44.884
A choir. Has anyone had any
experience of running a choir?

14:45.051 --> 14:47.929
Lisa, you're musical, no?

14:48.013 --> 14:51.641
No, my mum used to teach music.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.435
But, I mean,
choir's not really my thing.

14:53.685 --> 14:54.686
Right.

14:56.980 --> 14:57.981
Knitting?

14:59.315 --> 15:00.316
Knitting?

15:00.984 --> 15:01.985
Knitting.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.118
Should we have invited Kate?

15:10.827 --> 15:12.037
I bet you she can knit.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.043
Ohh.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.754
You know this is supposed to
take your mind off being upset?

15:21.254 --> 15:24.257
I just... I wanted to make
something nice for Liam.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.760
I love wool, I love sheep.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.595
Any little mistakes
give knitting character.

15:29.346 --> 15:30.347
Let's have a look.

15:34.476 --> 15:37.520
There you go, make a lovely...
tea cosy.

15:37.604 --> 15:41.066
- Or toilet roll cover.
- Cos we all need one of those.

15:41.316 --> 15:44.194
I don't know how you lot
can just makes jokes.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.154
I just feel sick all the time.

15:46.237 --> 15:49.407
Every time the phone rings,
every time the doorbell goes.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.035
I feel sick. How do you cope?

15:55.830 --> 15:57.624
Do you not... talk about it?

16:01.127 --> 16:03.129
- Who wants some wine?
- I'd love some wine.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.926
- Lisa, where are your glasses?
- In the dishwasher.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.429
All right, Frankie? Give us a smile!

16:11.763 --> 16:12.764
There you go.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.059
What?

16:22.732 --> 16:24.401
There are some benefits
when they go away.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.152
I grow my pubes.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.738
It's like Sherwood Forest
by the time Matt gets home.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.784
And you don't have to
brush your teeth.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.495
You don't have to pretend
you like <i>Top Gear.</i>

16:39.833 --> 16:41.418
<i>Today we're gonna
be making some tea,</i>

16:41.501 --> 16:43.878
<i>and taking a look at
the Brexar glass kettle.</i>

16:44.629 --> 16:48.425
<i>For today only, if you
purchase the Brexar glass kettle,</i>

16:48.508 --> 16:53.138
<i>you also get this stunning five-piece
knife set and wooden block.</i>

16:53.221 --> 16:56.349
<i>So clever and unique.
It's the Brexar glass kettle.</i>

16:56.433 --> 16:58.601
<i>It takes tea-making
to a whole new level.</i>

17:15.744 --> 17:17.287
- Yeah?
- <i>Hello, Kate.</i>

17:17.370 --> 17:20.248
<i>Comms are down.
No further details at this time.</i>

17:21.374 --> 17:22.625
But they've only just got there.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.461
<i>Sat phone and
internet on lockdown.</i>

17:24.544 --> 17:26.588
<i>I'll let you know when I hear further.</i>

17:26.671 --> 17:27.672
Yeah.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.056
- Hello.
- Hiya.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.974
- Is your mum in?
- Mum?

17:40.518 --> 17:42.062
So... how was knitting club?

17:42.604 --> 17:45.065
- There isn't a knitting club.
- Yes, I've heard the joke.

17:45.357 --> 17:47.650
First rule of knitting club:
"There is no knitting club."

17:47.734 --> 17:51.363
They disbanded last night
due to impracticalities.

17:51.613 --> 17:52.697
Oh.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.785
- They can't knit.
- Oh.

17:57.911 --> 17:58.912
Hi.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.497
Get a move on,
you're gonna be late.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.166
Yeah?

18:04.084 --> 18:05.085
Comms are down.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.006
- What, already?
- They're stuck in Green Zone.

18:10.090 --> 18:13.343
- They've got to tab out.
- Do the women know?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.345
A text message has gone out.

18:15.804 --> 18:16.971
Best thing is to keep busy.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.523
<i>...possible bypass routes.</i>

18:26.606 --> 18:28.733
<i>We see first-hand for ourselves.</i>

18:28.817 --> 18:32.946
<i>While we're filming, a report comes in
of another bombing close to the base.</i>

18:33.029 --> 18:36.241
<i>The Yorks Quick Reaction Force
gets ready to move out.</i>

18:36.324 --> 18:37.325
You all right?

18:37.409 --> 18:40.036
<i>Just been scrambled
because a suicide bomber</i>

18:40.120 --> 18:42.205
- <i>has just detonated his device...</i>
- Thank you.

18:44.207 --> 18:45.417
Gonna look good.

18:48.003 --> 18:49.170
Sorry.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.049
Hello?

18:54.342 --> 18:55.802
No, I've not been in an accident.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.662
- Hello.
- Hi.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.539
I just thought I'd pop in
and see how you're doing.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.459
Oh, OK. Thank you.

19:27.542 --> 19:28.668
Erm...

19:29.627 --> 19:33.298
Richard and I were also married
last minute, pre-deployment.

19:33.381 --> 19:36.384
My family all thought I was
pregnant, just being coy.

19:39.637 --> 19:40.638
Oh, are you?

19:41.473 --> 19:44.059
No, Liam just wanted me
to be next of kin.

19:44.976 --> 19:48.021
You know, comms down
doesn't necessarily mean anything.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.065
It's just the men
aren't allowed to talk to us.

19:50.774 --> 19:54.110
The military want to ensure that
no false information gets through.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.654
It's very important to keep busy.

19:57.489 --> 19:58.782
Less time to think about things.

19:59.991 --> 20:00.992
Yeah.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.370
I was actually thinking
of decorating.

20:03.870 --> 20:04.871
Hm.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.665
It is a bit depressing, isn't it,
the magnolia box?

20:09.417 --> 20:11.878
I was gonna do a, erm...

20:12.462 --> 20:13.713
a signature wall.

20:14.339 --> 20:17.425
And then pick out the purple
in the other walls.

20:17.509 --> 20:20.136
Yeah, hm... it's a bit signature.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.180
It took Richard and I
six coats of paint

20:22.263 --> 20:25.141
to cover up the mess I made
when we first marched out.

20:27.310 --> 20:29.521
Oh, God, sorry, that's Liam.

20:29.604 --> 20:32.232
He always puts our teddies
into different sexual positions,

20:32.315 --> 20:33.692
every time I leave the room.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.860
It's to make me laugh,
he's done it since we were kids.

20:35.944 --> 20:39.072
Not "kids" kids, since we were 15.

20:40.615 --> 20:42.367
Let's get cracking on these boxes,
shall we?

20:42.450 --> 20:44.619
I've got this exercise bike
I need to finish.

20:44.703 --> 20:47.122
OK, great.

20:59.342 --> 21:00.844
Comms back on is a good thing!

21:00.927 --> 21:03.179
Mm, yeah, I know. Sorry.

21:03.388 --> 21:04.723
Aww!

21:05.432 --> 21:06.808
Come on.

21:08.685 --> 21:09.936
Don't be silly.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.897
Let's get some music on
and get cracking, eh?

21:19.696 --> 21:20.697
Sorry.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.657
Thanks.

21:29.622 --> 21:30.915
What have we got here?

21:32.250 --> 21:33.251
Erm...

21:37.922 --> 21:40.008
Probably just start
with the instructions.

21:40.759 --> 21:42.052
- Here you go.
- Let's have a look.

21:45.013 --> 21:48.850
<i>Sprung in completeness</i>

21:48.975 --> 21:50.685
<i>Where His feet...</i>

21:57.067 --> 21:59.736
Just give one of those to everyone.
There should be enough.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.115
What you doing?

22:05.492 --> 22:07.827
Right, has everyone
got a hymn sheet?

22:08.370 --> 22:10.622
- Time to liven up this coffee morning.
- What's happening?

22:11.414 --> 22:12.999
I'm going to give you all a note.

22:13.083 --> 22:16.461
Then I'm going to count to three
and we can start. So...

22:18.129 --> 22:22.759
<i>La-la-la-la-la-la</i>

22:22.842 --> 22:24.302
One, two, three...

22:24.386 --> 22:28.723
<i>Morning has broken</i>

22:28.807 --> 22:30.308
<i>Like the...</i>

22:31.601 --> 22:33.436
Okay, I'll just... Everyone up.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.521
Come on, up your get.

22:34.813 --> 22:35.897
I'll start again.

22:37.232 --> 22:38.858
One, two, three...

22:38.942 --> 22:42.779
<i>Morning has broken</i>

22:42.862 --> 22:46.741
<i>Like the first morning</i>

22:46.825 --> 22:50.412
<i>Blackbird has spoken</i>

22:50.495 --> 22:53.998
<i>Like the first bird</i>

22:56.793 --> 22:57.961
<i>Prai...</i>

22:59.254 --> 23:01.006
OK, I'll just give you the note again.

23:01.089 --> 23:03.008
<i>La-la-la-la-la</i>

23:03.842 --> 23:05.301
One, two, three...

23:05.385 --> 23:09.014
<i>Praise for the singing</i>

23:09.097 --> 23:12.600
<i>Praise for the morning</i>

23:13.059 --> 23:17.564
<i>Praise
for the singing...</i>

23:17.647 --> 23:18.982
<i>Fresh from the...</i>

23:19.065 --> 23:20.483
Billy. Sorry.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.027
<i>...world</i>

23:22.110 --> 23:24.320
That's... That's lovely.
That was lovely.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.781
I've got to run to work. Sorry. Sorry.

23:27.782 --> 23:28.825
Bye.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.201
I was really enjoying that.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.204
- Lisa, wait.
- Why?

23:33.872 --> 23:36.291
That was like the incantations
of a bunch of witches.

23:36.374 --> 23:38.293
- Bit dramatic.
- No, it's an understatement.

23:38.376 --> 23:40.128
That was horrible.

23:40.211 --> 23:41.880
They need something to focus on.

23:42.589 --> 23:43.965
I think Afghan is enough.

23:44.049 --> 23:48.511
No, besides that. They need
something to work on collectively,

23:48.595 --> 23:50.972
a project,
something that brings them together.

23:51.056 --> 23:54.559
Look, if you think singing
<i>Onward, Christian Soldiers</i>

23:54.642 --> 23:56.603
with a pole up your arse
is what the women need,

23:56.686 --> 23:58.063
you're more out of touch
than I thought.

23:58.146 --> 24:00.732
I am simply trying to do my duty
as Colonel's wife...

24:00.815 --> 24:03.902
If you want to do it, just go ahead.
You don't need my permission.

24:03.985 --> 24:06.988
We both know the women
won't join if you don't.

24:07.238 --> 24:08.740
I'm quite aware
of how they feel about me.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.411
Listen, I know you still want
to be part of the gang.

24:13.495 --> 24:17.207
But unfortunately, you have
a leadership role on this tour.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.084
And that means responsibilities.

24:22.212 --> 24:23.922
You may not need the choir, Lisa.

24:24.255 --> 24:25.382
But those women do.

24:26.341 --> 24:28.635
<i>Blackbird has spoken</i>

24:28.718 --> 24:31.388
Can we at least call it
a singing club?

24:31.846 --> 24:33.890
How do people at Flitcroft
get involved?

24:33.973 --> 24:35.183
They just turn up.

24:35.475 --> 24:37.560
No auditions, everyone welcome.

24:37.852 --> 24:40.313
Yeah, so it's like a drop-in.

24:41.064 --> 24:42.774
Yeah, and then you commit.

24:42.857 --> 24:44.317
But only if you really want to.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.780
It's not about experience
or endless practice at home.

24:48.863 --> 24:50.240
<i>Though it'd be encouraged.</i>

24:50.323 --> 24:52.075
<i>So it's more about enthusiasm?</i>

24:52.158 --> 24:53.451
- <i>Well...</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

24:53.535 --> 24:55.161
I know you're busy
but would you like...

24:55.954 --> 24:58.665
Just two hours, once a week.
Open to all ranks.

25:01.835 --> 25:04.421
Do you watch <i>Songs Of Praise?</i>
You might enjoy that.

25:05.797 --> 25:09.634
We're forming a choir. Would you
like to join? It's on Thursdays.

25:09.718 --> 25:11.177
<i>What kinds of songs will you sing?</i>

25:11.261 --> 25:12.262
<i>Pop music.</i>

25:12.345 --> 25:13.930
<i>Good old traditional and rousing.</i>

25:14.014 --> 25:15.140
<i>Rock.</i>

25:15.890 --> 25:18.309
- So it's gonna be like Sister Act?
- Yes.

25:18.393 --> 25:20.020
You know, without the Mafia hitmen.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.563
And the God bit.

25:23.023 --> 25:25.316
All right. I'll have a think.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.360
<i>It's open to all ranks, right?</i>

25:27.444 --> 25:29.070
Oh, yes, this choir is inclusive.

25:29.779 --> 25:32.907
Yeah, this singing club
is gonna be a lot of fun.

25:33.533 --> 25:34.784
And uplifting.

25:34.868 --> 25:37.829
Yeah, and there'll be
a few beers afterwards.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.543
<i>La-la-la-la-la</i>

25:43.626 --> 25:45.587
<i>La-la-la-la-la</i>

25:48.923 --> 25:51.926
That's lovely, a soprano. Little bit
flat, but we can work on that.

25:52.385 --> 25:54.971
- Who's next?
- I thought we didn't have to audition.

25:55.055 --> 25:58.058
This isn't an audition,
I'm just determining your vocal range.

25:59.476 --> 26:00.518
Anyone?

26:01.686 --> 26:03.563
- Oh?
- No.

26:03.646 --> 26:04.647
No?

26:04.731 --> 26:07.776
Why don't we just start off as a...
like, as a group?

26:07.859 --> 26:09.903
Yeah, OK. Feel free.

26:10.487 --> 26:12.197
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:12.947 --> 26:14.032
Erm...

26:14.699 --> 26:16.201
All right, everyone stand up.

26:16.493 --> 26:18.078
Everyone on your feet.

26:19.287 --> 26:20.288
Yeah?

26:21.039 --> 26:23.166
When you can't sing the note

26:23.708 --> 26:24.751
just sit down.

26:25.418 --> 26:28.046
It's OK, I'll do it.

26:29.506 --> 26:32.008
<i>La-la-la-la-la</i>

26:34.177 --> 26:36.346
<i>La-la-la-la-la</i>

26:38.515 --> 26:40.558
La-la-la-la-la

26:50.276 --> 26:51.736
Right, OK.

26:51.945 --> 26:55.115
Right, so everyone who's standing,
you're a soprano.

26:55.198 --> 26:57.242
So you just go to your left.

26:58.493 --> 27:01.287
That's your right. My left.

27:01.413 --> 27:03.415
And if you're still sitting down,
you're an alto.

27:03.498 --> 27:04.874
Go to the right.

27:04.958 --> 27:07.377
Ruby, I think
you're more of a minor tone.

27:07.752 --> 27:09.546
She just means your voice
is really powerful.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.214
- Yeah.
- You know...

27:11.506 --> 27:13.091
Imagine you're Luke Skywalker

27:13.174 --> 27:14.759
and you have to learn
to harness The Force.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.221
So where do the minors stand?

27:18.388 --> 27:19.597
- At the back.
- In the front.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.142
Erm... middle?

27:22.267 --> 27:23.435
Yeah.

27:24.978 --> 27:25.979
So...

27:27.439 --> 27:28.898
- You go ahead. No, no, go ahead.
- No...

27:29.107 --> 27:32.485
- OK...
- Thanks very much, Lisa. Lovely.

27:32.902 --> 27:36.740
So today's practice is going to focus
on something called count singing.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.116
Don't panic.

27:38.199 --> 27:39.951
It's a very easy exercise

27:40.035 --> 27:43.204
to help us with pitch and rhythm
without having to learn lyrics.

27:43.288 --> 27:44.998
Why don't we just sing a song?

27:45.123 --> 27:46.750
This is just how
I learnt it at school.

27:47.334 --> 27:48.335
So...

27:48.752 --> 27:51.004
<i>One, one, two, one</i>

27:51.087 --> 27:53.131
<i>One, two, three, two, one</i>

27:53.214 --> 27:55.925
<i>One, two, three,
four, three, two, one</i>

27:56.009 --> 27:58.303
See? It's very easy.
All together now.

27:59.095 --> 28:01.222
<i>One, one, two, one</i>

28:01.306 --> 28:03.558
<i>One, two, three,
four, three, two, one</i>

28:03.641 --> 28:05.352
<i>One, two, three, four, five...</i>

28:05.435 --> 28:08.021
No, sorry, there's no five. No five.

28:09.022 --> 28:10.190
We'll start again.

28:10.273 --> 28:13.318
<i>One, one, two, three, two, one</i>

28:13.401 --> 28:14.652
<i>One, two, one</i>

28:14.736 --> 28:16.654
<i>One, two, three,
four, three, two, one</i>

28:16.738 --> 28:17.781
<i>One, one, two, one...</i>

28:17.864 --> 28:19.240
- Bang!
- Oww!

28:20.075 --> 28:21.785
<i>One, two, three, two...</i>

28:27.207 --> 28:29.167
<i>Bum-bum, ba-ba-bum</i>

28:29.626 --> 28:30.669
<i>Ba-ba-ba...</i>

28:30.752 --> 28:32.170
- Does it not remind you of...
- No.

28:33.171 --> 28:35.674
<i>You were working
as a waitress in a...</i>

28:35.757 --> 28:37.175
<i>Cocktail bar</i>

28:37.258 --> 28:38.426
Does that...

28:38.718 --> 28:39.803
Shall we?

28:40.011 --> 28:41.846
<i>...when I met you</i>

28:42.305 --> 28:45.183
<i>I picked you up, I shook you off</i>

28:45.266 --> 28:47.477
<i>I turned you around</i>

28:47.560 --> 28:50.480
<i>I turned you into someone new</i>

28:50.563 --> 28:51.564
Come on, the chorus.

28:51.648 --> 28:53.692
<i>Don't... Don't...</i>

28:54.025 --> 28:55.610
<i>Don't you want me?</i>

28:56.152 --> 28:57.862
<i>You know I don't believe it</i>

28:58.113 --> 29:00.740
<i>When I hear that you won't see me</i>

29:00.824 --> 29:02.033
<i>Don't</i>

29:02.450 --> 29:03.993
<i>Don't you want me?</i>

29:05.036 --> 29:09.416
<i>You know I don't believe it
when I hear that you won't see me</i>

29:09.499 --> 29:11.418
<i>It's much too late to find</i>

29:11.501 --> 29:13.503
<i>That you think
you've changed your mind</i>

29:13.586 --> 29:18.216
<i>You'd better change it back
or we will both be sorry</i>

29:18.299 --> 29:20.677
<i>Don't you want me, baby?</i>

29:20.760 --> 29:22.554
<i>Boom-ba-doop, boo</i>

29:22.846 --> 29:26.433
<i>Don't you want me, oh-oh?</i>

29:26.766 --> 29:29.686
<i>Don't you want me, baby?</i>

29:29.769 --> 29:31.062
<i>Ba-da-ba-ba</i>

29:31.146 --> 29:34.733
<i>Don't you want me, oh-oh?</i>

29:35.233 --> 29:38.236
<i>Don't you want me, baby?</i>

29:39.571 --> 29:43.199
<i>Don't you want me, oh-oh?</i>

29:46.119 --> 29:47.162
Erm...

29:47.245 --> 29:48.872
I was just thinking
we could have a chat

29:48.955 --> 29:50.790
about how we're
gonna approach this.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.710
I wasn't aware
we were approaching anything.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.296
- I thought you asked for my help.
- To mobilise them.

29:56.504 --> 29:58.089
- I was thinking...
- Look.

29:58.506 --> 30:02.093
The point of choir isn't to facilitate
what the wives can already do.

30:02.177 --> 30:03.678
It's not sober karaoke.

30:04.012 --> 30:06.181
Choir needs to be challenging
so that for one hour,

30:06.264 --> 30:09.059
they're thinking about something
other than their troubles.

30:09.934 --> 30:11.644
We can't just muddle through.

30:11.728 --> 30:15.148
It needs to be organised, something
we both know is not your strongpoint.

30:17.192 --> 30:19.152
Can I have my pocket money?

30:19.235 --> 30:21.279
What? You've had it.

30:24.532 --> 30:26.618
You know, you could do something
to earn a bit of extra money.

30:26.701 --> 30:28.703
I'm not stacking shelves
in the NAAFI again.

30:28.787 --> 30:31.581
No, I mean, like, child-minding
for the singing club.

30:31.664 --> 30:33.249
- You could do that.
- I'm all right.

30:34.334 --> 30:36.169
Where are you going?
I'm about to make dinner.

30:36.252 --> 30:38.088
Nowhere. There is nowhere to go.

30:38.171 --> 30:41.466
- Well, what are you gonna eat?
- I might go to the chippy later.

30:41.758 --> 30:43.134
Oh, the chippy?

30:43.677 --> 30:45.512
Good job you've got
your leathers on.

30:45.595 --> 30:47.097
You know, and your full face.

30:47.305 --> 30:48.431
For the chippy.

30:55.355 --> 30:57.649
- I want change.
- Bye!

31:12.372 --> 31:14.290
One, two, three...

31:37.022 --> 31:38.356
Oh, my God.

32:24.527 --> 32:26.571
Hey, Kate, you're a soprano.

32:26.654 --> 32:27.989
Yeah, of course you are.

32:28.073 --> 32:30.492
Why don't you take a seat over
there beside Annie?

32:30.575 --> 32:32.410
We're not singing Yazoo?

32:32.494 --> 32:35.580
And don't get used to these.
I don't want you hiding behind them.

32:35.663 --> 32:37.540
- This is only the soprano part.
- Yeah.

32:37.624 --> 32:40.460
- I divide them up into parts.
- How do we know when to come in?

32:40.543 --> 32:43.505
I taught them.
They listened and they memorised.

32:43.588 --> 32:46.216
Oh. Are you going to play that thing
without any music?

32:46.800 --> 32:50.261
Yeah, I just think reading music
makes things a bit stilted.

32:50.345 --> 32:52.555
Oh, not sure Mozart
would agree with that.

32:52.639 --> 32:55.225
Well, The Beatles didn't read music
and I think they did OK.

32:55.308 --> 32:56.810
Yeah, OK.

32:57.018 --> 32:59.020
So we're gonna do
exactly what we did earlier.

32:59.104 --> 33:00.438
I'm gonna give you
your starting note.

33:04.901 --> 33:06.111
Three, four...

33:11.157 --> 33:14.035
<i>Looking from a window above</i>

33:14.119 --> 33:16.496
<i>It's like a story of love</i>

33:17.497 --> 33:20.500
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

33:20.959 --> 33:23.753
<i>Came back only yesterday</i>

33:23.837 --> 33:26.506
<i>I'm moving further away</i>

33:27.215 --> 33:29.884
<i>Want you near me</i>

33:29.968 --> 33:30.969
Yeah, OK.

33:31.052 --> 33:32.053
It was really good, so...

33:32.137 --> 33:36.891
May I suggest we just take a little
time just to learn the parts properly

33:36.975 --> 33:38.643
so that when
we add them all together...

33:38.727 --> 33:40.103
Everyone's lost the will to live.

33:41.271 --> 33:43.523
Let's just sing it again.
Just have one go, right?

33:43.606 --> 33:45.191
- OK, fine.
- Let's just go again.

33:45.734 --> 33:46.735
Absolutely.

33:49.112 --> 33:52.198
Sorry, but, my right hand
will show the tempo.

33:52.282 --> 33:54.576
One, two, three, four...

33:54.659 --> 33:57.954
And my left hand is going to
tell you when to come in. Like this.

33:58.038 --> 33:59.956
It's like she's guiding
a plane in to land.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.291
- Finished?
- Yeah.

34:01.374 --> 34:02.834
- And...
- Let's have a...

34:04.210 --> 34:06.296
One, two, three, four...

34:08.673 --> 34:11.718
<i>Looking from a window above</i>

34:11.801 --> 34:14.554
<i>It's like a story of love</i>

34:15.096 --> 34:18.391
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

34:18.850 --> 34:21.603
<i>Came back only yesterday</i>

34:21.686 --> 34:24.105
<i>I'm moving further away</i>

34:25.398 --> 34:28.360
<i>Want you near me</i>

34:29.486 --> 34:32.739
<i>All I needed was the love you gave</i>

34:34.449 --> 34:38.078
<i>All I needed for another day</i>

34:38.578 --> 34:42.123
<i>And all I ever knew</i>

34:42.665 --> 34:44.084
<i>Only you</i>

34:56.137 --> 34:57.806
We can't see you... There he is!

34:57.889 --> 34:59.808
- <i>Can you see me?</i>
- Say, "Hi, Daddy."

34:59.891 --> 35:02.477
- <i>Hey, Billy.</i>
- Hello, Daddy.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.688
- <i>Hey, mate.</i>
- Hello, Daddy.

35:05.397 --> 35:07.148
- <i>How are you?</i>
- Good.

35:07.232 --> 35:10.026
<i>What have you been doing, Billy?
Been a good boy for Mummy?</i>

35:10.694 --> 35:12.946
<i>Daddy misses you and Mummy
a million...</i>

35:13.738 --> 35:15.115
I miss you too. Are you there?

35:15.740 --> 35:16.741
Hello?

35:17.784 --> 35:19.661
We've lost you.
Hang on, are you there?

35:21.454 --> 35:22.455
Hello?

35:45.228 --> 35:46.354
Ah-ha.

36:20.889 --> 36:23.224
<i>The Ultimatt Air Bed
has a built-in pump</i>

36:23.391 --> 36:25.518
<i>and it can self-inflate
in just three minutes.</i>

36:25.602 --> 36:27.771
<i>Yeah, it's just so efficient.</i>

36:27.854 --> 36:30.231
<i>This bed can support
up to 200 kilograms.</i>

36:30.315 --> 36:32.525
<i>Suzy, you know
what weighs 200 kilograms?</i>

36:32.609 --> 36:34.027
<i>I don't know.
You tell me, Larry.</i>

36:34.110 --> 36:35.320
<i>This guy.</i>

36:35.403 --> 36:38.365
<i>Oh, my goodness!
Is that a gorilla?</i>

36:38.448 --> 36:39.532
<i>Get in here, fella.</i>

36:40.533 --> 36:43.536
<i>It's not a real gorilla, it's actually
a man in a gorilla suit</i>

36:43.620 --> 36:45.455
<i>and he has a weight
belt underneath.</i>

36:46.039 --> 36:47.665
<i>Quite some weight. OK, go.</i>

36:47.749 --> 36:49.876
<i>Oh, wow!</i>

36:54.005 --> 36:55.215
Ow!

37:00.804 --> 37:01.930
I can't...

37:04.349 --> 37:05.350
Frankie?

37:06.893 --> 37:09.646
- Are you all right?
- My stuff's all wet.

37:10.146 --> 37:11.147
I've got you.

37:11.231 --> 37:14.734
<i>Shout, shout, let it all out</i>

37:14.818 --> 37:16.319
<i>Let it all out</i>

37:16.903 --> 37:18.571
<i>Let it all out</i>

37:22.409 --> 37:25.662
<i>These are the things
I can do without</i>

37:25.745 --> 37:26.746
<i>Come on</i>

37:26.830 --> 37:28.540
Your mum's not answering.

37:28.623 --> 37:31.001
I've left a message,
I'm sure she'll be here in a minute.

37:31.084 --> 37:34.129
I'm not drunk, no. I only had one.

37:36.756 --> 37:38.425
Stop it spinning.

37:52.939 --> 37:54.566
Come on, let's get you on your side.

37:57.110 --> 37:58.862
There's a basin right here, OK?

38:07.662 --> 38:09.164
Sorry, I didn't see my phone.

38:12.292 --> 38:13.501
Right.

38:15.503 --> 38:17.922
I mean, we could leave her
and let her sleep it off.

38:20.133 --> 38:21.259
Yeah, maybe.

38:23.011 --> 38:24.054
Are you sure?

38:24.679 --> 38:25.722
Yeah.

38:29.976 --> 38:32.395
I guess they just need to let off
a bit of steam sometimes.

38:35.523 --> 38:38.526
Yeah. Apparently,
if they see their parents drinking,

38:38.610 --> 38:40.362
they're twice as likely
to do it themselves.

38:43.990 --> 38:44.991
Yeah.

38:45.075 --> 38:46.951
I'll let myself out. Thanks.

38:49.245 --> 38:51.331
- Bye.
- Bye.

38:55.919 --> 38:58.672
<i>...control of
insurgent strongholds in the area.</i>

38:58.838 --> 39:00.006
Hello.

39:00.757 --> 39:01.800
Hiya.

39:03.301 --> 39:04.719
Is toast all right?

39:05.553 --> 39:08.890
I'm afraid I don't have any exciting
breakfast cereals any more.

39:10.725 --> 39:11.976
I dried your things out.

39:12.477 --> 39:14.479
Thanks. Did I puke?

39:14.688 --> 39:15.772
Nope.

39:18.316 --> 39:19.693
Your house is dead tidy.

39:20.276 --> 39:23.029
Ours always looks like a bomb's
gone off when Dad's away.

39:23.571 --> 39:25.907
Then I guess you haven't got
anyone to make it messy, though.

39:27.951 --> 39:30.328
I suppose keeping it tidy
gives me something to do.

39:31.913 --> 39:33.498
So you don't think about him?

39:36.418 --> 39:38.628
They think we don't know
when people die, but we do.

39:39.462 --> 39:41.589
Like, everyone at school
talks about it.

39:42.424 --> 39:45.468
- They talk about Jamie?
- They talked about you more.

39:49.973 --> 39:51.349
Is that Jamie's car outside?

39:51.433 --> 39:52.726
No, it's mine.

40:01.317 --> 40:02.610
Ah, hi, Frankie.

40:03.528 --> 40:05.989
Right, are we ready to go
into the den and play a game?

40:06.239 --> 40:09.409
Shall we go? OK, right. Take your
book and I'll see you in a minute.

40:10.577 --> 40:13.288
Oi, what are you doing?
You about to take a biscuit?

40:13.371 --> 40:15.665
Go on. Go inside,
we're gonna play a game together.

40:15.749 --> 40:17.834
- You minding kids?
- Do you want to go inside?

40:17.917 --> 40:21.046
I asked her. I hope that's OK.
They are a bit of a distraction.

40:21.129 --> 40:24.090
She's going to do it tomorrow as well
while we go for a hike on the moors.

40:24.174 --> 40:25.258
Right.

40:27.385 --> 40:29.971
Is that Kate's punishment
for you getting pissed last night?

40:31.264 --> 40:32.599
We need to talk about that,
by the way.

40:33.391 --> 40:34.559
Whatever.

40:34.642 --> 40:36.144
No, I'm serious. Where were you?

40:36.686 --> 40:37.687
I was just out.

40:38.271 --> 40:39.272
Frankie!

40:39.356 --> 40:41.191
What? You all get
pissed all the time

40:41.274 --> 40:43.109
cos there's nothing to do,
why shouldn't I?

40:49.449 --> 40:50.825
I said no sheet music.

40:51.743 --> 40:53.453
Right, everyone up.

40:54.037 --> 40:55.246
Here's your starting note.

40:55.580 --> 40:58.500
I'm gonna count us in. Three, four...

40:58.583 --> 41:00.710
<i>Shout, shout</i>

41:00.794 --> 41:02.545
<i>Let it all out</i>

41:02.921 --> 41:06.675

I can do without</i>

41:06.758 --> 41:07.759
<i>Come on</i>

41:07.842 --> 41:08.968
Louder.

41:09.260 --> 41:11.805
<i>I'm talking to you, come on</i>

41:11.888 --> 41:12.931
Come on, let rip!

41:13.014 --> 41:15.558
<i>In violent times</i>

41:16.226 --> 41:19.062
<i>You shouldn't have to sell your soul</i>

41:19.145 --> 41:20.146
That's good.

41:20.313 --> 41:23.191
<i>In black and white</i>

41:23.274 --> 41:26.820
<i>They really, really ought to know</i>

41:26.903 --> 41:28.446
OK, really belt it out this time.

41:28.530 --> 41:32.534
And can we hear the Ts, please?
Enunciate. T-t-t.

41:33.159 --> 41:34.452
<i>You shouldn't have to...</i>

41:34.536 --> 41:38.456
<i>Shout, shout, let it all out</i>

41:38.540 --> 41:42.252
<i>These are the things
I can do without</i>

41:42.335 --> 41:43.712
<i>Come on</i>

41:43.795 --> 41:44.796
Lisa?

41:44.879 --> 41:47.590
<i>I'm talking to you, come on</i>

41:47.674 --> 41:49.426
Look, I understand
you want them to be passionate

41:49.509 --> 41:52.262
but really,
it just doesn't sound very good.

41:52.512 --> 41:56.516
They're having fun. Better that
than sounding joyless and in tune.

41:56.599 --> 42:00.603
I don't think projection is our issue.
All the top conductors...

42:00.687 --> 42:03.023
This reminds me of
when my parents got divorced.

42:44.022 --> 42:45.607
Have you got first-aid kit, Crooks?

42:46.399 --> 42:48.443
What's the problem?
I'm the designated first-aider.

42:48.526 --> 42:50.779
Honestly, it's fine.
I just need some plasters.

42:50.862 --> 42:53.782
I'll be the judge of that.
There's nothing I didn't see in Iraq.

42:58.912 --> 43:00.413
It's for Dawn's nipples.

43:01.831 --> 43:03.625
She forgot to wear a bra
and they're chafing.

43:05.335 --> 43:08.213
Erm... you'll find
some plasters in there.

43:08.296 --> 43:10.799
Yeah, I'll bring... Yeah.

43:18.264 --> 43:19.891
Aa-ooh!

43:23.353 --> 43:24.896
<i>Ooh, ooh</i>

43:24.979 --> 43:26.356
Sounds really nice.

43:27.399 --> 43:29.234
That sounds gorgeous!

43:32.487 --> 43:33.655
Keep going, keep going.

43:33.738 --> 43:36.241
<i>Looking from the window above</i>

43:36.324 --> 43:38.326
<i>Like a story of love</i>

43:38.410 --> 43:39.536
- Go on!
- Go on.

43:40.078 --> 43:43.206
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

43:43.289 --> 43:45.875
<i>Came back only yesterday</i>

43:45.959 --> 43:48.753
<i>I'm moving further away</i>

43:49.713 --> 43:53.008
<i>Want you near me</i>

43:53.758 --> 43:57.387
<i>All I needed was the love you gave</i>

43:58.722 --> 44:02.475
<i>All I needed for another day</i>

44:02.892 --> 44:06.354
<i>And all I ever knew</i>

44:06.938 --> 44:07.981
<i>Only you</i>

44:08.064 --> 44:10.233
<i>Ba-da-da, bum-bum</i>

44:10.316 --> 44:12.819
<i>Ba-da-da, bum-bum</i>

44:12.902 --> 44:15.947
<i>Sometimes when I
think of her name</i>

44:16.031 --> 44:18.992
<i>When it's only a game</i>

44:19.701 --> 44:22.871
<i>And I need you</i>

44:23.163 --> 44:26.124
<i>Listen to the words that you say...</i>

44:27.709 --> 44:30.253
Go on, Jess.

44:30.337 --> 44:32.172
Bravo!

44:33.673 --> 44:35.091
Fifty quid a ticket, mate.

44:36.426 --> 44:38.428
Where are you going?
Where were you hiding that?

44:40.930 --> 44:43.058
Of course the Welsh girl
can bloody sing.

44:43.141 --> 44:44.559
It's all that yodelling
in the valleys.

44:44.642 --> 44:46.644
Thank you, kind ramblers!

44:46.728 --> 44:49.522
<i>All of the people,
around us they say</i>

44:49.606 --> 44:50.648
I don't know.

44:51.483 --> 44:53.902
Maybe this choir isn't about
singing for ourselves

44:54.819 --> 44:56.529
You know, maybe it's about them
being heard.

44:59.449 --> 45:00.909
Are you suggesting a performance?

45:00.992 --> 45:02.994
Yeah, but, you know, nothing fancy.

45:03.536 --> 45:04.829
Just maybe going to town.

45:05.663 --> 45:06.956
People round here
don't know we exist.

45:07.040 --> 45:09.542
But the Military don't want us
to be tall poppies.

45:10.043 --> 45:12.212
- I don't know what that means.
- It means...

45:12.462 --> 45:13.963
It's about appropriateness.

45:14.506 --> 45:18.468
I'm sure between us we can
figure out something appropriate.

45:19.052 --> 45:20.303
That's amazing.

45:20.387 --> 45:22.555
In the market with
everyone watching?

45:22.639 --> 45:23.848
It ticks a box, apparently.

45:23.932 --> 45:26.142
The new community covenant
to break down barriers

45:26.226 --> 45:27.394
and engage with the locals.

45:27.477 --> 45:28.728
Can we do Lulu?

45:29.187 --> 45:32.273
What about something modern,
like Rihanna?

45:32.357 --> 45:35.360
- <i>Africa</i> by Toto.
- No, we need <i>Holding Out For A Hero.</i>

45:35.443 --> 45:38.071
- That's a classic.
- No, it has to be something serious.

45:38.154 --> 45:39.864
Bonnie Tyler's got
really serious hair.

45:40.365 --> 45:42.909
- Emotional serious.
- <i>Time After Time,</i> Cyndi Lauper.

45:43.284 --> 45:44.661
I don't think I could do a sad song.

45:44.869 --> 45:47.706
Just sing the tune. Don't think about
the meaning of the words.

45:47.789 --> 45:48.915
Can I do a solo?

45:51.042 --> 45:52.752
I promise I won't lose my nerve.

45:52.836 --> 45:54.504
Mm-hm. Erm...

45:55.422 --> 45:57.924
or, we were actually
thinking about...

45:59.551 --> 46:00.593
missus there.

46:02.554 --> 46:03.555
No way.

46:04.806 --> 46:06.474
- What? Why?
- No, I can't.

46:06.558 --> 46:09.394
You can.

46:09.477 --> 46:10.562
- You can.
- You can.

46:14.566 --> 46:17.027
One, two, three, four...

46:17.110 --> 46:19.237
<i>Lying in my bed</i>

46:19.320 --> 46:21.406
<i>I hear the clock tick</i>

46:21.489 --> 46:23.783
<i>And I think of you</i>

46:23.867 --> 46:27.120
<i>Caught up in circles</i>

46:27.203 --> 46:30.832
<i>Confusion is nothing new</i>

46:31.291 --> 46:35.045
<i>Secrets stolen</i>

46:35.795 --> 46:38.381
<i>From deep inside</i>

46:38.798 --> 46:41.426
<i>The second hand unwinds</i>

46:41.509 --> 46:45.347
<i>If you're lost
you can look and you will find me</i>

46:46.139 --> 46:48.224
<i>Time after time</i>

46:48.808 --> 46:53.146
<i>If you fall
I will catch you, I'll be waiting</i>

46:53.480 --> 46:56.066
<i>Time after time</i>

46:57.025 --> 47:00.278
<i>Sometimes you picture me</i>

47:00.362 --> 47:04.074
<i>I'm walking too far ahead</i>

47:05.450 --> 47:08.536
<i>You're calling to me</i>

47:08.620 --> 47:12.499
<i>I can't hear what you've said</i>

47:12.957 --> 47:16.544
<i>Secrets stolen</i>

47:16.628 --> 47:19.297
<i>From deep inside</i>

47:19.923 --> 47:22.550
<i>The drum beats out of time</i>

47:22.634 --> 47:26.554
<i>If you're lost
you can look and you will find me</i>

47:26.638 --> 47:28.682
<i>Time after time</i>

47:29.307 --> 47:31.476
<i>If you fall
I will catch you, I'll be waiting</i>

47:31.559 --> 47:33.395
<i>I will be waiting</i>

47:33.603 --> 47:35.689
<i>I will be waiting</i>

47:36.856 --> 47:39.067
<i>I will be waiting</i>

47:39.150 --> 47:41.736
<i>Time after time</i>

47:41.986 --> 47:43.947
<i>If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting</i>

47:44.280 --> 47:46.825
<i>I will be waiting...</i>

47:47.492 --> 47:50.245
All seems first-rate.
Same time next month, then.

47:50.328 --> 47:53.331
Let me just show you what the women
have been up to since your last visit.

47:55.458 --> 47:57.585
<i>...too far ahead</i>

47:57.669 --> 48:00.630
<i>You're calling to me</i>

48:00.714 --> 48:03.800
<i>I can't hear what you have said</i>

48:03.883 --> 48:07.053
HQ are going to love this. Fits in
perfectly with the new directives.

48:07.137 --> 48:09.848
You should have heard them
on the hike, sir. We were in...

48:09.931 --> 48:11.474
Thank you, Captain.
My car's waiting.

48:12.809 --> 48:15.395
<i>The drum beats out of time</i>

48:15.478 --> 48:19.399
<i>If you're lost
you can look and you will find me</i>

48:20.400 --> 48:22.360
<i>Time after time</i>

48:22.986 --> 48:24.863
<i>If you fall, I will catch you...</i>

48:24.946 --> 48:27.073
<i>I'll be waiting</i>

48:27.699 --> 48:29.784
<i>Time after time</i>

48:30.326 --> 48:34.581
<i>If you're lost
you can look and you will find me</i>

48:35.040 --> 48:38.668
<i>Time after time</i>

48:38.918 --> 48:40.920
<i>Time after time</i>

48:41.171 --> 48:45.967
<i>If you fall, I will catch you...
I will be waiting</i>

48:46.176 --> 48:48.386
<i>Time after time</i>

48:48.720 --> 48:52.432
<i>If you're lost,
you can look and you will find me</i>

48:53.308 --> 48:55.226
<i>Time after time</i>

48:55.810 --> 48:59.564
<i>If you fall, I will catch you...
I will be waiting</i>

49:00.732 --> 49:02.859
<i>Time after time</i>

49:04.110 --> 49:05.111
<i>Time after time</i>

49:05.195 --> 49:06.571
I need to speak to you all.

49:06.654 --> 49:10.075
Oh, Jesus. Is it about the blow-up
doll we sent out to Bastion?

49:13.578 --> 49:14.579
She's joking.

49:16.039 --> 49:19.334
Brigadier Groves heard you rehearsing
when he was here a few weeks ago.

49:19.918 --> 49:21.252
He's told the top brass.

49:25.882 --> 49:28.593
And you've been invited to sing
at the Festival of Remembrance.

49:30.845 --> 49:31.930
What?

49:33.431 --> 49:35.016
The Festival of
Remembrance on TV?

49:36.768 --> 49:38.228
- The big one?
- That one.

49:38.311 --> 49:39.521
At the Royal Albert Hall?

49:48.154 --> 49:49.739
I can't wait to tell my mum.

49:50.156 --> 49:52.117
Do you reckon the lads will be able
to see it out in Afghan?

49:52.200 --> 49:54.536
- Hope not.
- You don't need to worry.

49:54.619 --> 49:56.746
We are gonna be match fit
after that market gig.

49:56.830 --> 49:59.457
It's all right for you, Maz.
You haven't got to do a solo.

49:59.582 --> 50:02.210
Just see the market
as a dress rehearsal.

50:02.293 --> 50:05.171
And I'll be by your side.
Like shoulder buddies.

50:05.255 --> 50:07.841
Eh? Come on, cheer up.

50:07.924 --> 50:09.384
You're not helping, Maz.

50:09.592 --> 50:11.511
Is that not helping you?

50:14.597 --> 50:16.141
Stop the war,
sign the petition.

50:16.474 --> 50:18.143
Stop the war, sign the petition.

50:18.226 --> 50:20.562
Troops out of Afghanistan.
Stop the war, sign the petition.

50:20.645 --> 50:22.981
Stop the bloodshed.
Troops out of Afghanistan.

50:23.064 --> 50:24.482
Can I interest you in a leaflet?

50:24.566 --> 50:27.402
We don't have the privilege of being
against the war. We're married to it.

50:28.194 --> 50:29.279
Stop it.

50:35.285 --> 50:36.745
Good afternoon, everyone.

50:37.787 --> 50:41.666
We are
the Flitcroft Military Wives Choir.

50:42.250 --> 50:44.627
We'd like to sing for you
this afternoon.

50:57.974 --> 51:00.185
Three, four...

51:03.772 --> 51:06.399
<i>Lying in my bed</i>

51:06.483 --> 51:08.818
<i>I hear the clock tick</i>

51:08.902 --> 51:10.987
<i>And I think of you</i>

51:11.321 --> 51:14.449
<i>Caught up in circles</i>

51:14.532 --> 51:17.827
<i>Confusion is nothing new</i>

51:19.412 --> 51:22.457
<i>You say, "Go slow"</i>

51:23.166 --> 51:25.168
<i>I fall behind</i>

51:25.377 --> 51:27.212
<i>The second hand...</i>

51:27.295 --> 51:29.798
<i>The second hand unwinds</i>

51:29.881 --> 51:34.052
<i>If you're lost
you can look and you will find me</i>

51:34.135 --> 51:36.721
<i>Time after time</i>

51:37.180 --> 51:39.683
<i>If you fall
I will catch you, I'll be waiting</i>

51:39.766 --> 51:41.643
<i>I will be waiting</i>

51:41.726 --> 51:44.270
<i>Time after time</i>

51:44.979 --> 51:48.024
<i>Time after time</i>

51:48.733 --> 51:51.528
<i>Time after time</i>

51:51.611 --> 51:52.696
Come on.

51:52.779 --> 51:55.407
<i>Time after time</i>

52:09.921 --> 52:12.549
<i>Time after time</i>

52:13.466 --> 52:14.467
<i>Time after time</i>

52:14.551 --> 52:16.094
We'll be laughed out
of the Albert Hall.

52:18.847 --> 52:20.098
I don't want to sing any more.

52:21.057 --> 52:22.642
I'm not a minor, I'm just shit!

52:22.934 --> 52:25.270
Maybe you could silently
mouth the words.

52:25.854 --> 52:26.938
Like Dawn.

52:31.526 --> 52:32.736
Erm... Marilyn?

52:33.153 --> 52:36.740
What does your football coach
say to you after a defeat?

52:37.198 --> 52:39.200
Easy. It's all about control.

52:39.284 --> 52:40.285
Exactly.

52:40.785 --> 52:42.579
A defence-splitting pass,
bring it down,

52:42.662 --> 52:43.997
knock it to the forwards. Boom.

52:46.958 --> 52:49.377
- Look, do you like singing?
- Of course we do.

52:49.461 --> 52:51.671
- Do you like being in the choir?
- Love it.

52:51.755 --> 52:54.924
Think the top brass would've asked
you to sing if you were shit?

52:55.675 --> 52:57.093
No, we just chose the wrong venue.

52:57.177 --> 52:59.137
- Yeah, and that was our fault.
- Exactly.

52:59.220 --> 53:02.474
Do you want to give up because of
that or work harder

53:02.557 --> 53:03.725
so we really kill it
at the Albert Hall?

53:03.808 --> 53:05.226
- Kill it.
- Which?

53:05.852 --> 53:07.020
- Kill it.
- Right.

53:08.605 --> 53:09.981
So how shall we do that, Kate?

53:11.524 --> 53:14.235
Er... well, we choose
a small repertoire.

53:14.319 --> 53:17.447
We practise together and at home.

53:18.156 --> 53:20.116
We tweak, we review, tweak, review

53:20.200 --> 53:22.243
until we come together
like a shoal of fish.

53:23.953 --> 53:26.456
The best Military Wives choir
in England.

53:26.790 --> 53:30.210
Well, the only Military Wives choir
in England.

53:32.504 --> 53:34.130
<i>Come on, girls.</i>

53:34.214 --> 53:36.216
<i>We're singing for England</i>

53:36.299 --> 53:37.801
<i>Eng-ger-land</i>

53:37.884 --> 53:40.011
<i>We're singing in a foreign...</i>

53:40.095 --> 53:42.263
Oi! If I'd done that...

53:42.555 --> 53:43.973
<i>For England</i>

53:44.057 --> 53:47.769
<i>You've got to hold and give
and do it at the right time</i>

53:47.852 --> 53:51.690
<i>You can be slow or fast
but you must get to the line</i>

53:53.650 --> 53:55.318
Behold our choir.

53:55.860 --> 53:57.862
Dignified, noble.

53:58.530 --> 53:59.531
Class.

53:59.614 --> 54:02.992
<i>So catch me if you can
cos I'm an England woman</i>

54:04.160 --> 54:05.829
What would your karaoke song be?

54:06.246 --> 54:08.206
Karaoke's my idea of hell.

54:08.289 --> 54:10.166
But if you had to,
if you'd no choice?

54:11.418 --> 54:14.337
Well,
I did do <i>Tainted Love</i> once.

54:14.421 --> 54:16.381
But then I drank two bottles
of white wine,

54:16.464 --> 54:17.632
smoked a packet of cigarettes

54:17.716 --> 54:19.968
and threw up
in Richard's parents' garden.

54:20.051 --> 54:22.137
Sounds like a good night.
So <i>Tainted Love?</i>

54:22.220 --> 54:24.222
- No!
- I'll do it with you.

54:24.305 --> 54:26.558
Come on. Imagine their little faces.

54:27.100 --> 54:29.436
Why not? No one's going to remember
in the morning. We're doing it.

54:30.186 --> 54:32.981
Kiki and Elton.
Come on, everyone, this is a classic.

54:33.898 --> 54:35.942
That's a lucky escape. Next one.

54:39.654 --> 54:41.448
<i>Don't go breaking my heart</i>

54:42.782 --> 54:45.243
<i>I couldn't if I tried</i>

54:46.786 --> 54:49.706
<i>Well, honey, if I get restless...</i>

54:59.174 --> 55:01.509
<i>You took the weight off of me</i>

55:02.635 --> 55:05.805
<i>Oh, honey, knock...
Knock on my door</i>

55:06.514 --> 55:08.558
<i>Ooh, I gave you my key</i>

55:10.185 --> 55:12.145
<i>Ohhh...</i>

55:12.228 --> 55:13.772
<i>Ooh-hoo</i>

55:14.147 --> 55:16.149
<i>Nobody knows it</i>

55:23.615 --> 55:24.616
Hey.

55:25.367 --> 55:26.785
I wasn't trying to be pushy.

55:26.868 --> 55:29.079
No, no, no.
I just needed some air, that's all.

55:29.412 --> 55:31.956
Yeah, well, Kevin's singing
will do that to you.

55:41.883 --> 55:44.803
Jamie and I sang that song together
at his 18th.

55:46.262 --> 55:47.639
- Oh, fuck.
- Yeah.

55:50.058 --> 55:52.394
He made me. I was mortified.

55:52.477 --> 55:54.062
He, of course,
thought it was hilarious.

55:57.232 --> 55:59.442
But then, he thought
his job on this earth

55:59.526 --> 56:01.027
was to keep people laughing.

56:06.533 --> 56:09.869
Yeah, I remember Red saying that
he had a way of looking at things...

56:10.745 --> 56:12.539
he'd just find the funny
in everything.

56:15.083 --> 56:16.376
Even when he was little.

56:17.085 --> 56:20.296
Whenever Richard went away,
we'd have this big jar of sweets,

56:20.380 --> 56:23.425
and Jamie was allowed one sweet
a day every day of the tour.

56:23.967 --> 56:26.261
And when the jar
was empty, Richard...

56:27.220 --> 56:28.263
Frankie did that.

56:28.847 --> 56:31.599
Counting down the days till the
family was back together again.

56:32.350 --> 56:35.353
Jamie used to say,
"Until we laugh again."

56:38.815 --> 56:40.442
Mm.

56:42.402 --> 56:43.987
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

56:48.491 --> 56:50.035
I don't know how you...

56:55.582 --> 56:57.083
Oh.

56:57.917 --> 56:59.169
Right, OK.

56:59.252 --> 57:00.628
I'm off.

57:00.712 --> 57:02.714
You don't have to.
I'm not gonna make you sing.

57:03.006 --> 57:04.049
Good night.

57:05.300 --> 57:06.384
Hey, Kate?

57:06.968 --> 57:08.053
The Albert Hall, huh?

57:08.720 --> 57:11.056
Not tall poppies any more,
we're bloody sunflowers.

57:13.266 --> 57:14.267
Night.

57:16.895 --> 57:18.313
<i>If you wanna be my lover</i>

57:20.398 --> 57:22.692
<i>Slam, slam, slam, slam!</i>

57:22.901 --> 57:24.778
<i>If you wanna be my lover...</i>

57:24.861 --> 57:26.571
<i>Slam your body down
and wind it all around</i>

57:26.654 --> 57:28.406
<i>Hup, hup, hup, hup!</i>

57:43.922 --> 57:46.091
- Tell me.
- <i>Comms are down.</i>

57:46.466 --> 57:49.094
<i>Richard's been injured
but he's gonna be OK.</i>

57:49.219 --> 57:50.637
<i>He's in Kabul hospital.</i>

57:50.970 --> 57:53.556
<i>RAMC will fly him back later today,</i>

57:53.640 --> 57:55.558
<i>transfer him straight to Flitcroft.</i>

57:55.642 --> 57:56.810
Any fatalities?

57:58.353 --> 57:59.354
Handball.

58:00.021 --> 58:01.106
You handballed that.

58:03.775 --> 58:05.360
Skills. Go on.

58:07.028 --> 58:08.279
Gotcha. Ready?

58:17.580 --> 58:18.748
Pass me the ball.

58:19.541 --> 58:20.750
Come on, pass me the ball.

58:22.127 --> 58:23.753
Let's go and get a little biccy
or something, eh?

58:24.337 --> 58:25.463
All right?

58:29.092 --> 58:30.760
- Any pink ones?
- Yeah.

58:41.104 --> 58:43.064
Sarah Cartwright?

58:53.992 --> 58:55.243
Who is her trusted friend?

58:55.827 --> 58:59.205
She didn't name anyone. Said she was
waiting to see who she got close to.

59:02.959 --> 59:06.838
Well, Jess is
good at stuff like that. Or Ruby.

59:07.672 --> 59:08.798
She's asked for you, Kate.

59:10.300 --> 59:11.509
Says you've been there yourself.

59:26.107 --> 59:27.192
OK.

59:40.705 --> 59:41.790
It's fallen over.

59:43.333 --> 59:44.501
Sorry?

59:45.251 --> 59:46.753
Liam's teddy's fallen over.

59:48.755 --> 59:50.256
That doesn't mean anything.

59:51.424 --> 59:53.551
Of course it does,
because what it means has happened.

1:00:03.228 --> 1:00:04.229
Here.

1:00:06.272 --> 1:00:07.315
Thanks.

1:00:18.076 --> 1:00:19.452
Do I have to leave the base now?

1:00:20.537 --> 1:00:23.164
No. No, whenever you're ready.

1:00:25.333 --> 1:00:26.668
But don't think about that now.

1:00:52.527 --> 1:00:53.528
Right, so...

1:00:54.529 --> 1:00:55.613
shall we give it a go?

1:00:59.534 --> 1:01:01.911
Do you think she's read
Liam's death letter yet?

1:01:04.372 --> 1:01:06.458
I don't think I could read Stu's
if it came to it.

1:01:09.294 --> 1:01:10.503
I read Malc's...

1:01:12.547 --> 1:01:14.257
after the last Afghan tour.

1:01:16.634 --> 1:01:17.719
I'd do it again.

1:01:20.138 --> 1:01:21.431
It helped me. It said...

1:01:23.767 --> 1:01:26.853
all these lovely things about me
that he'd never say to my face.

1:01:30.774 --> 1:01:33.943
To be fair, though, he's not gonna
not write that, is he?

1:01:36.196 --> 1:01:38.656
I mean, he's not gonna write
a list of things he hates about you.

1:01:41.493 --> 1:01:45.163
"Dear Ruby, wish you'd rinse the
bath out after you shave your legs."

1:01:47.332 --> 1:01:48.375
"Dear Jess,

1:01:48.458 --> 1:01:51.586
"really wish you wouldn't wash up
the cups before I'd finished my tea."

1:01:51.670 --> 1:01:54.422
I wish you wouldn't do that,
to be honest. It's so annoying.

1:01:55.298 --> 1:01:57.842
I just can't bear
the thought of anyone

1:01:57.926 --> 1:02:00.261
coming to give me bad news
and the house being a mess.

1:02:05.809 --> 1:02:08.228
I'm not in
the mood for singing today.

1:02:30.875 --> 1:02:31.960
Darling.

1:02:34.129 --> 1:02:36.464
This is nothing serious.

1:02:39.509 --> 1:02:41.720
- You're lucky.
- I was stupid.

1:02:41.803 --> 1:02:42.929
Mm.

1:02:45.098 --> 1:02:46.891
Katy, there's something
I need to tell you.

1:02:48.351 --> 1:02:49.394
No, you don't.

1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:51.813
- I don't?
- No.

1:02:53.273 --> 1:02:54.524
I know you didn't have to go.

1:02:55.442 --> 1:02:56.609
You put yourself forward.

1:03:00.739 --> 1:03:05.618
You try and file away those feelings
about what happened

1:03:05.702 --> 1:03:07.495
on the shelves in your head.

1:03:12.542 --> 1:03:13.710
I shouldn't have gone.

1:03:19.674 --> 1:03:22.510
Richard, sorry, I've got so many
things to do, I've got to leave.

1:03:22.594 --> 1:03:23.720
Call you later.

1:03:23.803 --> 1:03:26.681
It's the thing I admire
about you most, the way you cope.

1:03:29.309 --> 1:03:31.353
That is a depressing thing to say,
Richard.

1:03:31.436 --> 1:03:33.104
Are you going to put that
on my gravestone?

1:03:33.188 --> 1:03:36.316
I meant I understand how you feel.

1:03:36.399 --> 1:03:39.527
Oh, you understand?
What do you understand, exactly?

1:03:40.153 --> 1:03:42.280
- Enlighten me.
- No, I just...

1:03:42.364 --> 1:03:44.407
I'm the one who has
to answer the phone in the night,

1:03:44.491 --> 1:03:46.534
who has to worry about
what state you'll come back in,

1:03:46.618 --> 1:03:49.996
who has to...
who has to look at you in that bed

1:03:50.080 --> 1:03:53.083
and then I have to go out there,
I have to get on with it

1:03:53.166 --> 1:03:54.334
and do my duty.

1:03:54.417 --> 1:03:57.253
I have responsibilities,
I can't go round with a wet face.

1:03:57.671 --> 1:04:01.591
"I'm so sorry, my husband's been blown up.
Would you like a cup of tea?

1:04:01.883 --> 1:04:04.469
"I'm so sorry, my husband's
got shrapnel in his head.

1:04:04.594 --> 1:04:05.595
"Have some cake."

1:04:05.679 --> 1:04:08.264
I've always said you should be paid
for what you do.

1:04:35.208 --> 1:04:38.920
Lisa, I can't come to practice now.
I'm at the hospital with Richard.

1:04:39.004 --> 1:04:40.046
How is he?

1:04:40.839 --> 1:04:43.633
- <i>He's fine.</i>
- OK. Good.

1:04:43.717 --> 1:04:46.678
- What's the matter?
- No, I just wanted to, erm...

1:04:47.178 --> 1:04:49.806
let you know that you don't need
to worry about the Albert Hall.

1:04:49.889 --> 1:04:51.599
<i>The women don't want
to do it any more.</i>

1:04:52.017 --> 1:04:54.144
- It's a bit late for that.
- I'm sorry?

1:04:54.227 --> 1:04:57.063
It's utterly inappropriate
to pull out now.

1:04:57.147 --> 1:05:00.025
Well, they feel it would be utterly
inappropriate for them to sing.

1:05:00.150 --> 1:05:02.110
Lisa, if we pull out now,

1:05:02.277 --> 1:05:04.654
it will reflect badly on all of us.

1:05:06.156 --> 1:05:07.407
Shit.

1:05:18.209 --> 1:05:20.170
There will be a service
at Camp Bastion.

1:05:21.755 --> 1:05:23.631
Then Liam's body will be repatriated

1:05:23.715 --> 1:05:26.634
on a C-17 aircraft
coming through Wootton Bassett.

1:05:29.804 --> 1:05:33.308
After that, you and his parents are
going to have to make some decisions.

1:05:34.351 --> 1:05:37.187
Well, he grew up in care.
It's just me and the Army.

1:05:39.689 --> 1:05:40.857
And he...

1:05:40.940 --> 1:05:43.026
Did he ever express any wishes?

1:05:45.445 --> 1:05:46.821
No? OK.

1:05:48.823 --> 1:05:51.826
Well, then, we have to decide
what you want,

1:05:51.910 --> 1:05:54.954
whether you want a cremation
or a burial...

1:05:55.997 --> 1:05:57.499
flowers and a reading...

1:06:03.546 --> 1:06:04.589
What did you do?

1:06:06.466 --> 1:06:08.051
Oh, erm...

1:06:09.344 --> 1:06:10.887
James had a willow coffin.

1:06:12.472 --> 1:06:14.057
Are they the ones
where there's no lid

1:06:14.140 --> 1:06:16.351
and the bodies are covered
with flowers?

1:06:16.434 --> 1:06:18.937
You can do, but Jamie needed a lid.

1:06:23.900 --> 1:06:25.902
Liam's gonna need a lid as well,
isn't he?

1:06:29.364 --> 1:06:31.491
Shall I get that?

1:06:31.574 --> 1:06:32.701
It's OK.

1:06:34.285 --> 1:06:35.453
Right.

1:06:42.168 --> 1:06:43.211
Guys.

1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:45.171
Oh, come in, come in. Come in.

1:06:56.683 --> 1:06:57.684
Guys?

1:06:58.143 --> 1:06:59.352
OK.

1:06:59.936 --> 1:07:01.187
Sorry, could I...

1:07:02.230 --> 1:07:05.567
Could I just play you something
and ask you a question?

1:07:08.153 --> 1:07:12.907
So I first met Liam when he
was put next to me in English.

1:07:13.241 --> 1:07:15.160
He was dead naughty
and I was always a bit of a swat.

1:07:15.243 --> 1:07:17.078
They thought I'd sort him out.

1:07:18.496 --> 1:07:21.541
But our teacher took us on a trip
to York Cathedral.

1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:23.960
And there was a
choir practising this.

1:07:24.419 --> 1:07:27.589
Liam hated classical music.
He preferred grime.

1:07:27.672 --> 1:07:30.175
But he
did always like this.

1:07:31.134 --> 1:07:32.135
This one.

1:07:33.595 --> 1:07:36.890
And he sat next to me to listen to it.

1:07:36.973 --> 1:07:39.768
And while it was playing,
he touched my hand.

1:07:40.852 --> 1:07:43.855
And I remember nothing
about the rest of the concert,

1:07:43.938 --> 1:07:45.523
I was too busy thinking
about his hand.

1:07:48.902 --> 1:07:53.281
So that is how I'd really like to feel
when I say bye to him.

1:07:55.658 --> 1:07:59.204
You know, I want to feel
his hand touching mine.

1:08:00.330 --> 1:08:02.415
So I'd really, really love it if...

1:08:03.750 --> 1:08:07.962
if you could sing this for me,
well, for him, at his service.

1:08:31.361 --> 1:08:38.243
<i>Maiden mild</i>

1:08:40.620 --> 1:08:47.585
<i>O, listen to a maiden's prayer</i>

1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:57.804
<i>For Thou canst hear amid the wild</i>

1:09:00.390 --> 1:09:03.309
<i>'Tis Thou</i>

1:09:03.601 --> 1:09:10.567
<i>'Tis Thou canst save amid despair</i>

1:09:13.028 --> 1:09:14.487
Fire!

1:09:18.158 --> 1:09:19.409
Load!

1:09:23.788 --> 1:09:25.290
Fire!

1:09:25.373 --> 1:09:27.959
- It was a beautiful service.
- Thank you.

1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:29.961
Kate.

1:09:31.087 --> 1:09:32.213
It's been far too long.

1:09:33.214 --> 1:09:36.343
I'm really looking forward
to the full choir performance

1:09:36.426 --> 1:09:37.719
at the Festival of Remembrance.

1:09:37.802 --> 1:09:40.096
Yes, but sadly
we're not going to do it.

1:09:40.305 --> 1:09:41.389
What?

1:09:41.473 --> 1:09:44.642
Yes, the women have decided
that it's just too soon.

1:09:52.484 --> 1:09:53.860
You're not doing the Albert Hall?

1:09:54.819 --> 1:09:55.820
Well...

1:09:56.696 --> 1:09:59.032
You sang today and it was beautiful.

1:09:59.115 --> 1:10:00.325
But that was just for you today,

1:10:00.408 --> 1:10:02.077
it was personal,
not for entertainment.

1:10:02.660 --> 1:10:04.579
Guys, make
it personal, then.

1:10:05.622 --> 1:10:06.748
Please don't pull out.

1:10:08.625 --> 1:10:11.127
There are gonna be
so many people in that room...

1:10:12.087 --> 1:10:13.254
like me.

1:10:15.215 --> 1:10:16.883
And I want to do this for them.

1:10:17.676 --> 1:10:19.552
But I can't do that on my own.

1:10:23.056 --> 1:10:25.642
- What are we gonna sing?
- Does it have to be classical?

1:10:26.059 --> 1:10:27.268
Dunno.

1:10:28.103 --> 1:10:30.563
Maybe we should do <i>Angels,</i>
like at Sarah's wedding.

1:10:30.980 --> 1:10:32.524
It's not really about us,
though, is it?

1:10:33.066 --> 1:10:35.110
We're not gonna find anything
that's about us, though.

1:10:36.152 --> 1:10:37.862
Know what song
I've always really liked?

1:10:37.987 --> 1:10:39.698
That Dido one where she goes,

1:10:39.781 --> 1:10:42.617
"I woke up, my tea's cold,
I've got a hangover

1:10:42.701 --> 1:10:43.827
"but you've made everything great."

1:10:43.910 --> 1:10:44.953
That classic!

1:10:45.036 --> 1:10:47.122
It is a classic, it's really personal.

1:10:47.205 --> 1:10:50.208
<i>My tea's gone cold,
I'm wondering why</i>

1:10:50.417 --> 1:10:52.711
<i>I got out of bed at all</i>

1:10:52.794 --> 1:10:56.214
<i>The morning rain
clouds on my window</i>

1:10:56.381 --> 1:10:58.550
<i>And I can't see at all</i>

1:10:58.758 --> 1:11:02.220
And then Eminem, don't say it,
starts rapping about a psychotic stalker.

1:11:03.096 --> 1:11:04.973
Love that at the Royal Albert Hall.

1:11:05.056 --> 1:11:07.017
Maz could do that bit. Bit of rapping.

1:11:07.100 --> 1:11:08.893
- I forgot about that bit.
- Maz and a rap.

1:11:11.104 --> 1:11:12.188
Let's, er...

1:11:13.148 --> 1:11:14.482
Let's just keep thinking, yeah?

1:11:14.691 --> 1:11:16.192
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:11:16.609 --> 1:11:18.862
- All right.
- Night. Have a good night.

1:11:32.542 --> 1:11:34.336
<i>Yeah!</i>

1:11:45.472 --> 1:11:47.015
Oh, you have a bluey from Dad.

1:11:48.475 --> 1:11:49.517
Right.

1:12:10.580 --> 1:12:11.790
Do you want to watch a film?

1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:15.001
A film.

1:12:16.586 --> 1:12:17.629
Oh.

1:12:18.963 --> 1:12:19.964
Yeah.

1:12:20.048 --> 1:12:21.758
- Yeah.
- What do you fancy?

1:12:24.386 --> 1:12:25.387
I will have a look.

1:12:33.353 --> 1:12:34.354
<i>Rocky?</i>

1:12:36.272 --> 1:12:38.233
What? Are you serious?

1:12:38.316 --> 1:12:39.317
Yeah.

1:12:39.818 --> 1:12:41.486
- OK, fine.
- Yes, yes!

1:12:45.615 --> 1:12:47.033
<i>That's a good idea, Lisa.</i>

1:12:47.409 --> 1:12:50.412
But the thing is,
all my letters are about QPR.

1:12:51.621 --> 1:12:54.374
Mine are far too mucky.

1:12:55.166 --> 1:12:57.502
We won't put any of the dirty bits in.
We'll just...

1:12:58.169 --> 1:13:01.256
you know, find bits
that represent our feelings

1:13:01.339 --> 1:13:02.966
and just work it into the song.

1:13:03.174 --> 1:13:04.300
Just like that?

1:13:04.384 --> 1:13:06.886
I'm not expecting
to win a Brit Award.

1:13:06.970 --> 1:13:08.179
But how bad can it be?

1:13:08.263 --> 1:13:10.432
You've not read what I've written.

1:13:10.515 --> 1:13:14.019
It's not gonna be all, "I love you
to the moon and back" is it?

1:13:14.978 --> 1:13:16.896
I don't want to puke down myself
in the Albert Hall.

1:13:16.980 --> 1:13:20.275
You don't want me to make us
look like meek little women

1:13:20.358 --> 1:13:21.818
pining for our big brave husbands?

1:13:21.901 --> 1:13:23.236
And wives.

1:13:23.319 --> 1:13:25.989
What's wrong with saying,
"I love you to the moon and back"?

1:13:26.740 --> 1:13:29.534
There's nothing wrong
with it at all, Jess.

1:13:29.617 --> 1:13:30.869
It's just a little bit...

1:13:30.952 --> 1:13:32.954
- Sorry.
- Kate?

1:13:33.955 --> 1:13:36.041
Lisa's got an idea
for the Albert Hall.

1:13:36.124 --> 1:13:37.125
Oh, good.

1:13:37.625 --> 1:13:40.420
I was just thinking about
what Sarah was saying...

1:13:40.545 --> 1:13:43.673
about making the
song more personal.

1:13:44.382 --> 1:13:45.550
We're gonna write our own song.

1:13:46.634 --> 1:13:48.094
- Using bits of our letters.
- Yeah.

1:13:48.178 --> 1:13:49.971
And putting
them to Lisa's tune.

1:13:51.139 --> 1:13:52.140
Oh.

1:13:52.724 --> 1:13:54.768
- Play your song for her.
- Go on, play it.

1:13:55.101 --> 1:13:57.395
It's not a song yet. It's just...

1:13:58.438 --> 1:14:00.190
It's a... You know, it's like a...

1:14:02.233 --> 1:14:05.278
It's a tune.
You have to imagine the words bit.

1:14:13.578 --> 1:14:15.288
Actually, do you think
we could talk about this later?

1:14:18.124 --> 1:14:20.460
Well, why don't we talk about it
now? Everyone's here.

1:14:22.253 --> 1:14:25.674
Really, how realistic is this,
given your limitations?

1:14:26.383 --> 1:14:29.177
- What?
- You can't read music, can you?

1:14:30.303 --> 1:14:34.015
The Festival of Remembrance
is a professional event.

1:14:34.099 --> 1:14:37.977
It's not some amateur
school choir performance.

1:14:38.228 --> 1:14:41.147
We cannot embarrass ourselves
and we cannot let Flitcroft down.

1:14:41.231 --> 1:14:42.357
Do you know what? Forget it.

1:14:44.567 --> 1:14:45.944
Let's go back to the song board.

1:14:47.445 --> 1:14:48.488
Come on.

1:14:49.447 --> 1:14:50.907
I think we should
write our own song.

1:14:52.075 --> 1:14:53.076
Lisa, go on.

1:14:53.493 --> 1:14:55.662
And even if it's not amazing,
at least it's ours.

1:14:56.079 --> 1:14:57.080
Exactly.

1:14:58.206 --> 1:14:59.374
- Agreed.
- Yeah.

1:15:01.626 --> 1:15:02.627
<i>Next up,</i>

1:15:02.711 --> 1:15:06.548
<i>we have the innovative LED
colour-changing shower head...</i>

1:15:06.631 --> 1:15:07.966
You coming to bed?

1:15:09.259 --> 1:15:10.343
I'll be up in a minute.

1:15:12.887 --> 1:15:13.888
OK.

1:15:22.522 --> 1:15:24.899
- <i>Can you believe that?</i>
- <i>That's crazy.</i>

1:15:24.983 --> 1:15:28.528
<i>And it's only £119.99
plus postage and packaging.</i>

1:15:51.509 --> 1:15:55.597
"I swear that...
I keep no secrets from you."

1:15:56.639 --> 1:15:58.725
- OK.
- Embarrassing, that.

1:16:00.435 --> 1:16:01.603
Jess, what have you got?

1:16:02.979 --> 1:16:05.190
The only bit that could really work
in this song,

1:16:06.066 --> 1:16:07.067
is about the moon.

1:16:07.150 --> 1:16:09.736
- I love the moon!
- Go on.

1:16:09.819 --> 1:16:13.615
But it is actually what Stu writes
to me, so I suppose that's OK.

1:16:14.449 --> 1:16:15.533
Erm...

1:16:16.576 --> 1:16:18.953
"At 10 o'clock tonight,
I'll look at the moon.

1:16:19.954 --> 1:16:21.331
That's 1:30 for you."

1:16:21.664 --> 1:16:24.084
And then we look at it...

1:16:26.169 --> 1:16:27.253
...at the same time.

1:16:27.629 --> 1:16:28.630
That's lovely.

1:16:29.130 --> 1:16:30.173
"10 o'clock."

1:16:31.966 --> 1:16:33.051
- Erm...
- Next.

1:16:35.470 --> 1:16:38.515
We don't really go
for all that gushy stuff but...

1:16:38.890 --> 1:16:41.434
Well, we always
recognise the unsaid.

1:16:42.769 --> 1:16:44.354
We don't say what
we're both feeling.

1:16:45.939 --> 1:16:47.023
What goes unsaid.

1:18:09.939 --> 1:18:11.900
Frankie, can you just not...

1:18:12.776 --> 1:18:13.818
What's the matter with you?

1:18:15.904 --> 1:18:19.157
The matter with me is,
I still haven't finished the song yet.

1:18:20.241 --> 1:18:22.827
I can't... I've run out of bits
from the women's letters.

1:18:22.911 --> 1:18:25.872
- Just make something up.
- I can't make something up.

1:18:26.331 --> 1:18:27.916
I'm padding it out enough as it is.

1:18:28.750 --> 1:18:30.627
Frankie, wait. Sorry.

1:18:33.046 --> 1:18:35.256
Look through these notes,
see if you can find...

1:18:35.340 --> 1:18:37.342
I can't. I'm going out and I'm late.

1:18:39.094 --> 1:18:40.095
Late for what?

1:18:41.346 --> 1:18:42.931
Getting pissed
with rear party soldiers?

1:18:44.057 --> 1:18:46.935
I'm actually going out to child-mind
for your choir

1:18:47.227 --> 1:18:49.270
so that they can try on outfits
for tomorrow.

1:19:07.163 --> 1:19:08.164
So, Tina.

1:19:09.833 --> 1:19:10.834
Aretha.

1:19:11.543 --> 1:19:12.794
Madonna, Cher.

1:19:13.712 --> 1:19:14.754
Where's Dawn? Dawn?

1:19:15.130 --> 1:19:16.172
Sorry, Dawn.

1:19:17.882 --> 1:19:18.883
So come here.

1:19:19.676 --> 1:19:22.429
There's a line I thought could be
really good for a contralto.

1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:25.515
Am I a contralto?

1:19:26.349 --> 1:19:28.018
Yes. I think so.

1:19:30.478 --> 1:19:31.563
Thank you.

1:19:33.356 --> 1:19:34.441
Thank you.

1:19:36.317 --> 1:19:37.777
There's been some tweaks
to the lyrics.

1:19:37.861 --> 1:19:41.239
Don't panic,
cos we'll rehearse it on the bus.

1:19:42.032 --> 1:19:44.409
Whose is that, then,
"Till We Laugh Again"?

1:19:45.201 --> 1:19:46.202
Is that the new one?

1:19:47.078 --> 1:19:49.748
- Where's that?
- At the bottom. "Till We Laugh Again."

1:19:54.169 --> 1:19:57.047
I wanted to clear it with you,
but I just ran out of time.

1:19:57.130 --> 1:19:58.423
There was a gap.

1:19:59.424 --> 1:20:01.384
I mean, everyone else
has something in but...

1:20:04.429 --> 1:20:06.598
I thought it might help you,
you know, sing about him.

1:20:09.017 --> 1:20:10.602
I told you that in confidence.

1:20:11.853 --> 1:20:16.649
Not so that you could use
my child's words...

1:20:18.485 --> 1:20:23.073
to fill a gap in your crass,
sentimental ballad.

1:20:23.406 --> 1:20:24.741
Mum, have you seen my bag?

1:20:24.824 --> 1:20:26.910
- Just get on the bus, Frankie.
- No, I...

1:20:26.993 --> 1:20:28.828
- Just get on the bus!
- I should have known.

1:20:28.912 --> 1:20:32.040
I should have known you would
lose sight of what is important

1:20:32.123 --> 1:20:36.002
because you're so obsessed
with your five minutes of fame!

1:20:36.086 --> 1:20:37.462
What are you talking about?

1:20:37.545 --> 1:20:41.424
While you're swanning around, thinking
you're Paul fucking <i>Mull of Kintyre,</i>

1:20:41.508 --> 1:20:46.304
your annihilated daughter is prowling
the streets like a cat on heat.

1:20:46.388 --> 1:20:49.349
Before you know it,
she's gonna be handing out BJs

1:20:49.432 --> 1:20:52.060
or knocked up by
some spotty squaddie

1:20:52.310 --> 1:20:54.270
who doesn't know his arse
from his elbow!

1:20:58.400 --> 1:21:00.860
You don't hand out blow-jobs.

1:21:01.653 --> 1:21:02.737
You do them with your mouth.

1:21:03.697 --> 1:21:05.115
Not that I'd expect you to know that.

1:21:05.198 --> 1:21:07.450
You probably tell Richard
"to keep calm and carry on"

1:21:07.534 --> 1:21:08.618
when he's shagging you.

1:21:09.661 --> 1:21:11.996
I never claimed
to be a good songwriter,

1:21:12.080 --> 1:21:14.666
or even a good
mum, but I am trying!

1:21:16.167 --> 1:21:19.337
And all you do is
criticise and belittle me.

1:21:19.421 --> 1:21:23.299
But maybe I should have known that,
because you are a cold-hearted...

1:21:23.800 --> 1:21:25.677
uptight bitch, Kate!

1:21:25.760 --> 1:21:28.304
No wonder your husband
volunteered to go back to the war.

1:21:29.305 --> 1:21:32.809
Do you know what?
The bloody choir was your idea.

1:21:33.351 --> 1:21:34.352
Remember?

1:21:34.728 --> 1:21:37.397
You gave me that bullshit speech
about the women needing it.

1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:39.024
That it would bring them together.

1:21:39.315 --> 1:21:41.860
Really, you are the one
that needed the choir,

1:21:41.943 --> 1:21:43.278
because you needed
something to do.

1:21:43.361 --> 1:21:44.988
No, we all need something to do.

1:21:45.071 --> 1:21:47.615
No, we don't, Kate,
cos we all still have our kids!

1:22:14.100 --> 1:22:15.518
- Guys, Kate's gone.
- What?

1:22:16.853 --> 1:22:19.397
- That's it. I don't know any more.
- Where's she gone?

1:22:19.564 --> 1:22:21.316
- I don't know.
- Kate's gone?

1:22:26.321 --> 1:22:28.323
- Can I borrow your...
- Yeah, sure.

1:22:31.326 --> 1:22:32.827
Erm...

1:22:34.162 --> 1:22:35.330
Er...

1:22:37.874 --> 1:22:39.876
Sorry about the, erm...

1:22:41.586 --> 1:22:42.587
Sorry.

1:22:45.256 --> 1:22:46.633
Can we drive? Can we go now?

1:24:04.669 --> 1:24:05.670
Can I get in?

1:24:21.353 --> 1:24:22.604
What happened to the choir?

1:24:24.397 --> 1:24:25.398
They've gone.

1:24:27.942 --> 1:24:30.153
Lisa used something Jamie said...

1:24:30.570 --> 1:24:32.822
in her song, without asking me.

1:24:37.660 --> 1:24:39.120
"Until we laugh again."

1:24:41.706 --> 1:24:44.584
It's ridiculous. I know
it's just words, it doesn't matter.

1:24:44.668 --> 1:24:46.044
It's not ridiculous at all.

1:24:53.343 --> 1:24:56.054
Oh, God, I said some awful things.

1:24:59.766 --> 1:25:02.602
I behaved so badly.
I've let you down.

1:25:02.686 --> 1:25:03.812
No.

1:25:03.895 --> 1:25:05.355
We're both guilty of that.

1:25:13.029 --> 1:25:15.699
I threw my shoes on the ground
like a two-year-old.

1:25:17.826 --> 1:25:21.746
Well, it's no surprise you've come
to hide in Shite Rider, then, is it?

1:25:24.749 --> 1:25:28.253
The car wasn't called Shite Rider,
it was Jamie who was Shite Rider.

1:25:30.922 --> 1:25:32.507
- The car was called Dave.
- Dave.

1:25:57.323 --> 1:25:59.451
- Is it a panic attack?
- This is gonna be a disaster.

1:25:59.576 --> 1:26:01.619
- It's not.
- I appreciate your optimism,

1:26:01.703 --> 1:26:04.039
- but our last proper performance...
- Our only proper performance...

1:26:04.122 --> 1:26:05.248
...was a complete shit storm.

1:26:05.331 --> 1:26:07.292
And there wasn't any last-minute
lyric changes.

1:26:07.375 --> 1:26:09.753
- Lisa wasn't spinning out.
- And we had Kate.

1:26:33.818 --> 1:26:35.195
Let's take him for a spin.

1:26:36.696 --> 1:26:37.781
Blow the cobwebs out.

1:26:39.741 --> 1:26:40.825
It'll never work.

1:26:41.868 --> 1:26:42.911
Try.

1:26:46.081 --> 1:26:48.500
Come on, Dave.

1:26:50.085 --> 1:26:51.294
- No.
- Try again.

1:26:53.213 --> 1:26:55.715
No. Nothing there.

1:27:04.933 --> 1:27:05.975
Hey.

1:27:08.561 --> 1:27:09.604
Nice to get out.

1:27:16.361 --> 1:27:17.404
I'm sorry.

1:27:19.489 --> 1:27:22.617
I know how I've been acting with
you. I know I've been hard on you.

1:27:26.079 --> 1:27:28.623
I made so many mistakes
when I was young, Frankie.

1:27:28.707 --> 1:27:30.041
I just don't want the same for you.

1:27:32.669 --> 1:27:33.712
I love you.

1:27:35.171 --> 1:27:38.216
And when I was looking
through those letters to your dad,

1:27:38.299 --> 1:27:39.467
you know, for the song...

1:27:41.011 --> 1:27:42.637
they were all about you.

1:27:57.610 --> 1:27:58.820
- Take the strain.
- Yeah.

1:27:59.070 --> 1:28:00.613
- OK, push!
- I am.

1:28:00.697 --> 1:28:03.950
- Come on, put your back into it.
- I am pushing. Stop complaining.

1:28:04.034 --> 1:28:05.827
- I'm injured.
- Stop being such a martyr.

1:28:05.910 --> 1:28:08.830
It hurts! Come on, top of
the hill and gravity will do the rest.

1:28:22.427 --> 1:28:23.428
That's it.

1:28:24.846 --> 1:28:26.848
All right. Go on, then. Jump in.

1:28:26.931 --> 1:28:28.224
I'm getting in.

1:28:29.517 --> 1:28:31.186
Right, we can let the hill
do the work now.

1:28:31.853 --> 1:28:33.104
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1:28:33.188 --> 1:28:34.230
OK.

1:28:34.356 --> 1:28:35.899
Come on.

1:28:35.982 --> 1:28:38.777
Come on, jibble it.

1:28:40.820 --> 1:28:43.907
Come on, come on! Come on, Dave!

1:28:43.990 --> 1:28:46.326
Whoa-ho!

1:29:02.384 --> 1:29:03.426
Oh.

1:29:04.386 --> 1:29:05.387
Well?

1:29:37.460 --> 1:29:38.503
Oh, my God.

1:29:47.721 --> 1:29:50.015
- How tall is that?
- I'm really nervous now.

1:29:50.098 --> 1:29:52.851
- ...it's like security.
- We're never gonna get in.

1:29:52.934 --> 1:29:54.686
Yeah, you're not allowed!

1:29:55.854 --> 1:29:56.855
Oh, my God!

1:30:04.779 --> 1:30:06.406
Let's just all gather together here.

1:30:06.489 --> 1:30:09.367
Flitcroft Choir? You're on stage in
30 for a sound check.

1:30:09.451 --> 1:30:12.787
We know where we're going.
Everyone stick together.

1:30:15.623 --> 1:30:18.918
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Flitcroft Choir!

1:30:19.002 --> 1:30:20.420
Yeah!

1:30:28.386 --> 1:30:29.846
Katy, I need to ask you something.

1:30:30.638 --> 1:30:33.975
The airing cupboard
has some new additions.

1:30:35.810 --> 1:30:37.562
Well, I needed
something to lean on.

1:30:37.896 --> 1:30:39.731
Would you prefer
that I drank or gambled?

1:30:39.814 --> 1:30:42.233
No, of course not. Fair enough.

1:30:42.317 --> 1:30:45.779
A juicer...
a meat slicer's a bit more tenuous.

1:30:45.862 --> 1:30:47.072
But... But...

1:30:47.614 --> 1:30:51.076
250 quid on
an inflatable bed for a gorilla?

1:30:51.159 --> 1:30:52.369
Well, it's not for a gorilla,

1:30:52.452 --> 1:30:54.537
it's just to illustrate
its weight capacity.

1:30:57.624 --> 1:30:58.917
Oh...

1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:00.960
Oh, piss off, Richard!

1:31:05.382 --> 1:31:07.759
<i>Flitcroft Choir,
please take your positions</i>

1:31:07.842 --> 1:31:10.720
<i>on the risers for sound check.</i>

1:31:11.554 --> 1:31:13.473
On the podium thing.

1:31:14.265 --> 1:31:16.559
- Just find our spots.
- Camera three.

1:31:20.355 --> 1:31:22.691
- What are you doing?
- Checking my heart rate.

1:31:23.108 --> 1:31:24.609
You look like you're
choking yourself.

1:31:27.570 --> 1:31:30.240
OK, so we've got three hours.

1:31:30.699 --> 1:31:32.200
OK, we've got three...

1:31:32.283 --> 1:31:34.244
Where's Jess?

1:31:34.369 --> 1:31:35.829
Oh, she's here.

1:31:39.958 --> 1:31:42.085
What's the matter with her?
Did she faint?

1:31:42.168 --> 1:31:43.211
She's meditating.

1:31:43.294 --> 1:31:46.423
She can't lay down properly cos
she's come out in a rash on her arse.

1:31:47.924 --> 1:31:48.925
Right.

1:31:55.974 --> 1:31:58.685
Can you just, like,
get into your groups?

1:32:00.729 --> 1:32:02.188
It sounded like you were...

1:32:02.272 --> 1:32:03.773
Right, then, ladies.

1:32:04.315 --> 1:32:05.400
How are we all...

1:32:07.736 --> 1:32:08.945
I'm shitting my pants!

1:32:10.113 --> 1:32:11.114
OK?

1:32:11.531 --> 1:32:12.532
Very good.

1:32:13.283 --> 1:32:14.367
Carry on.

1:32:14.534 --> 1:32:18.038
There's been a bit of discussion about
that lyric change. We're confused.

1:32:18.121 --> 1:32:19.205
We're not doing Kate's lyric.

1:32:19.748 --> 1:32:23.668
We're just gonna do a repeat
of the second part of the first verse.

1:32:23.752 --> 1:32:26.546
Erm... so let's...

1:32:27.589 --> 1:32:28.590
Let's...

1:32:28.673 --> 1:32:31.885
Let's start by running up some...
Stop talking.

1:32:32.344 --> 1:32:34.012
Let's start by running
up some scales.

1:32:35.680 --> 1:32:37.390
<i>One, one, two, one...</i>

1:32:37.766 --> 1:32:39.517
<i>One, two, three, two, one...</i>

1:32:39.601 --> 1:32:42.103
- <i>One, two, three, four...</i>
- <i>...three, four, five...</i>

1:32:42.187 --> 1:32:43.229
Not five!

1:32:43.813 --> 1:32:46.983
Start again. Let's just all sing
at the same time, OK?

1:32:48.109 --> 1:32:49.235
Do it together. It's fun.

1:32:50.945 --> 1:32:52.614
And smiles. Enjoy it.

1:32:52.697 --> 1:32:54.908
Maybe you should
go and get some air.

1:32:55.700 --> 1:32:56.701
Just take five minutes.

1:32:57.994 --> 1:32:59.537
- It'll be fine.
- Yeah.

1:32:59.621 --> 1:33:00.622
OK.

1:33:01.373 --> 1:33:02.374
Yeah.

1:33:02.957 --> 1:33:04.042
All right, you...

1:33:13.802 --> 1:33:15.303
All right?

1:33:16.304 --> 1:33:17.972
Piss off!

1:33:18.890 --> 1:33:19.933
Can you zip me up?

1:33:25.021 --> 1:33:27.148
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, take your seats.</i>

1:33:27.232 --> 1:33:28.441
Thank you.

1:33:28.525 --> 1:33:32.570
<i>...members in the Grand Tier
please use entrances M to S.</i>

1:33:32.946 --> 1:33:36.950
<i>Those with tickets to the Second
Tier, please use A to F.</i>

1:33:37.033 --> 1:33:38.076
Thanks.

1:33:38.743 --> 1:33:40.578
Good luck.
You'll be marvellous!

1:34:04.811 --> 1:34:05.812
Kate!

1:34:10.233 --> 1:34:11.568
I am so sorry.

1:34:11.651 --> 1:34:13.653
Oh, Jesus. I'm... I'm sorry.

1:34:15.155 --> 1:34:16.698
I'm really, really sorry.

1:34:23.455 --> 1:34:25.707
- I changed the lyric.
- No.

1:34:27.417 --> 1:34:28.710
No, you didn't have to do that.

1:34:30.587 --> 1:34:33.131
Lisa, your song is beautiful.

1:34:34.924 --> 1:34:38.887
And I will be proud to stand
next to you and sing it.

1:34:39.971 --> 1:34:40.972
Really?

1:34:42.474 --> 1:34:43.516
OK.

1:34:45.518 --> 1:34:47.562
- Right, are they ready?
- Yeah.

1:34:47.979 --> 1:34:50.607
Er... no. No, they didn't want
to go on without you.

1:34:51.149 --> 1:34:52.317
Oh.

1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:55.737
It's after what I said to you earlier.
I think they're fucking scared of me.

1:34:55.820 --> 1:34:58.406
- You've got one hour.
- You look gorgeous.

1:34:58.740 --> 1:35:00.075
Not the boots, but...

1:35:13.171 --> 1:35:15.173
I know it's gonna be louder.

1:35:15.882 --> 1:35:16.883
Kate!

1:35:18.176 --> 1:35:20.428
- Oh, my God!
- Flipping heck!

1:35:21.137 --> 1:35:22.806
You made it.

1:35:23.139 --> 1:35:24.808
That's enough, that's enough.

1:35:24.891 --> 1:35:26.559
Quiet everyone, please.

1:35:26.643 --> 1:35:29.813
Listen to Lisa, she has
something very important to say.

1:35:30.563 --> 1:35:31.773
- What?
- Yeah, come on.

1:35:34.109 --> 1:35:35.318
Oh, shit.

1:35:36.945 --> 1:35:37.946
Er...

1:35:39.406 --> 1:35:41.032
Erm... OK.

1:35:44.077 --> 1:35:46.955
I dunno. Great music,
it doesn't happen when...

1:35:47.539 --> 1:35:48.707
things are perfect.

1:35:49.624 --> 1:35:50.959
It happens when you care.

1:35:51.626 --> 1:35:53.128
I know you all really care.

1:35:57.215 --> 1:35:58.258
Have you seen <i>Rocky?</i>

1:35:59.217 --> 1:36:01.094
Well, you know,
did he win his first fight?

1:36:01.177 --> 1:36:03.930
He doesn't.
He gets the shit beaten out of him.

1:36:05.015 --> 1:36:06.099
In public.

1:36:06.349 --> 1:36:09.185
But does he give up
and sit around crying?

1:36:09.269 --> 1:36:10.562
He does in <i>Rocky III.</i>

1:36:13.648 --> 1:36:16.860
Look, I know it feels a bit much
right now,

1:36:16.943 --> 1:36:18.695
going out there and doing that.

1:36:18.778 --> 1:36:19.821
But, Jesus.

1:36:20.655 --> 1:36:22.490
If we can survive
the last five months...

1:36:23.867 --> 1:36:25.285
we can survive five
minutes out there.

1:36:26.369 --> 1:36:27.537
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1:36:30.457 --> 1:36:32.876
Every successful choir...

1:36:33.960 --> 1:36:35.503
is just a bad choir
that didn't give up.

1:36:35.587 --> 1:36:37.172
OK, choir.

1:36:37.255 --> 1:36:39.716
You've got ten minutes to get ready.

1:36:40.175 --> 1:36:42.385
And then we are
gonna run our song.

1:36:42.927 --> 1:36:44.304
Right, and then we are gonna run it

1:36:45.180 --> 1:36:47.432
and we are gonna run it,
and we are gonna run it

1:36:47.515 --> 1:36:48.808
until we all come together.

1:36:48.892 --> 1:36:51.644
- Like a shoal of fish.
- Right, exactly.

1:36:52.020 --> 1:36:53.021
Like that.

1:36:53.730 --> 1:36:54.731
OK, come on, get ready.

1:36:58.568 --> 1:36:59.986
Ooh. Ooh, Frankie.

1:37:01.821 --> 1:37:03.031
What size feet have you got?

1:37:04.074 --> 1:37:05.200
Why?

1:37:10.330 --> 1:37:11.331
Yeah.

1:37:18.338 --> 1:37:20.006
<i>Ladies
and gentlemen.</i>

1:37:20.298 --> 1:37:23.218
<i>Welcome to this year's
Festival of Remembrance</i>

1:37:23.301 --> 1:37:25.595
<i>from London's Royal Albert Hall,</i>

1:37:25.679 --> 1:37:28.098
<i>where the British Legion
celebrates the courage</i>

1:37:28.181 --> 1:37:31.559
<i>of the men and women of the
Armed Forces and their families,</i>

1:37:31.768 --> 1:37:35.647
<i>and remembers sacrifices made from
the Somme to Helmand Province.</i>

1:37:45.073 --> 1:37:46.908
- Come and see.
- No, thank you.

1:37:47.242 --> 1:37:48.410
It's like childbirth.

1:37:48.827 --> 1:37:51.037
Best to be completely oblivious
until it's happening.

1:37:55.208 --> 1:37:57.877
<i>Now some performers
you won't have heard of.</i>

1:37:58.044 --> 1:38:00.296
<i>They're an often-forgotten
but essential part</i>

1:38:00.380 --> 1:38:04.134
<i>of the fabric of the Armed Forces
on whom our troops rely.</i>

1:38:04.217 --> 1:38:07.095
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together</i>

1:38:07.178 --> 1:38:09.973
<i>for the Flitcroft
Military Wives Choir.</i>

1:38:31.286 --> 1:38:33.830
<i>Time drags its feet</i>

1:38:34.330 --> 1:38:37.792
<i>Feels like forever</i>

1:38:39.085 --> 1:38:41.588
<i>But the longer the wait</i>

1:38:41.963 --> 1:38:44.966
<i>The sweeter the kiss</i>

1:38:47.177 --> 1:38:49.554
<i>All I really know</i>

1:38:49.721 --> 1:38:53.516
<i>Is we're stronger together</i>

1:38:55.185 --> 1:38:57.479
<i>If that isn't love</i>

1:38:57.645 --> 1:39:01.107
<i>Then I don't know what is</i>

1:39:03.193 --> 1:39:05.445
<i>I know you can't say</i>

1:39:05.820 --> 1:39:08.823
<i>How you're really feeling</i>

1:39:10.950 --> 1:39:13.328
<i>But what goes unsaid</i>

1:39:13.745 --> 1:39:16.414
<i>Is what I'm feeling too</i>

1:39:18.708 --> 1:39:21.336
<i>So here we are living</i>

1:39:22.003 --> 1:39:25.382
<i>Life through a letter</i>

1:39:26.758 --> 1:39:29.135
<i>There's nothing I love more</i>

1:39:29.219 --> 1:39:32.972
<i>Than home thoughts from abroad</i>

1:39:34.891 --> 1:39:40.397
<i>At 10 o'clock tonight
I'll be looking at the moon</i>

1:39:41.231 --> 1:39:44.567
<i>That's 1:30 for you</i>

1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:50.156
<i>Will you be up then too?</i>

1:39:50.615 --> 1:39:56.329
<i>I know that if it's shining on me
then it shines for you</i>

1:39:57.831 --> 1:40:00.709
<i>These simple things</i>

1:40:01.710 --> 1:40:04.921
<i>Help me get through</i>

1:40:10.468 --> 1:40:13.054
<i>I stand in the storm</i>

1:40:13.304 --> 1:40:17.183
<i>Just me and my sails</i>

1:40:18.309 --> 1:40:21.021
<i>And hope that it blows me</i>

1:40:21.354 --> 1:40:24.274
<i>Closer to you</i>

1:40:26.443 --> 1:40:28.319
<i>Secrets keep you sick</i>

1:40:28.403 --> 1:40:32.741
- <i>Secrets keep you sane</i>
- <i>They stop me from sleeping</i>

1:40:34.409 --> 1:40:36.369
<i>I want you to know</i>

1:40:36.703 --> 1:40:39.873
<i>I keep no secrets from you</i>

1:40:42.292 --> 1:40:44.669
<i>You always knew</i>

1:40:45.003 --> 1:40:48.673
<i>How to keep the world laughing</i>

1:40:49.924 --> 1:40:52.385
<i>Till we laugh again</i>

1:40:52.677 --> 1:40:57.766
<i>These home thoughts from abroad</i>

1:40:58.350 --> 1:41:03.688
<i>At 10 o'clock tonight
I'll be looking at the moon</i>

1:41:04.522 --> 1:41:07.901
<i>That's 1:30 for you</i>

1:41:08.568 --> 1:41:13.656
<i>Will you be up then too?</i>

1:41:13.782 --> 1:41:19.621
<i>I know that if it's shining on me
Then it shines for you</i>

1:41:21.331 --> 1:41:24.417
<i>These simple things</i>

1:41:25.043 --> 1:41:28.546
<i>Help me get through</i>

1:41:51.903 --> 1:41:53.113
Bravo!

1:42:18.513 --> 1:42:20.640
My hands are still shaking.

1:42:20.724 --> 1:42:23.893
<i>Urh... oh... oh... oh</i>

1:42:24.561 --> 1:42:27.105
- Yeah!
- Can we get two bottles of champagne?

1:42:28.023 --> 1:42:29.941
I don't remember what I did.

1:42:30.483 --> 1:42:31.735
Excuse me.

1:42:31.818 --> 1:42:33.403
Do you think I could
get your autograph?

1:42:34.863 --> 1:42:36.239
I haven't got an autograph.

1:42:36.322 --> 1:42:38.783
Just do a symbol, you know,
like Prince.

1:42:42.495 --> 1:42:43.621
Thank you.

1:42:44.497 --> 1:42:45.707
Can I get your autograph, please?

1:42:45.790 --> 1:42:46.791
Get lost.

1:42:47.083 --> 1:42:48.460
I don't need your autograph.

1:42:49.669 --> 1:42:50.920
I've got your number.

1:42:59.971 --> 1:43:01.097
Are you all right?

1:43:01.473 --> 1:43:05.143
Yeah, yeah. I'm not great, obviously.
But, yeah, I'm all right.

1:43:05.226 --> 1:43:08.563
I'm just really gonna miss the choir
when I move home.

1:43:08.980 --> 1:43:09.981
What do you mean?

1:43:10.315 --> 1:43:12.734
Your parents only live three miles
up the road from the base.

1:43:13.985 --> 1:43:15.111
Can I stay in the choir?

1:43:15.612 --> 1:43:17.155
Oh, I'll have to think about that.

1:43:19.532 --> 1:43:21.117
Of course you can stay, silly!

1:43:21.701 --> 1:43:22.827
Well done.

1:43:23.453 --> 1:43:25.663
- Well done?
- Yeah. That was really good.

1:43:25.747 --> 1:43:28.541
Oh, my God!
Hang on, just give me a second.

1:43:28.625 --> 1:43:30.418
Something I did was really good?

1:43:30.502 --> 1:43:32.420
All right, don't be weird about it.

1:43:32.587 --> 1:43:34.339
OK, I won't tell anyone you said it.

1:43:35.256 --> 1:43:37.801
Just myself, sometimes.

1:43:45.725 --> 1:43:47.227
I think we both deserve this.

1:43:47.435 --> 1:43:48.436
Yeah.

1:43:51.272 --> 1:43:52.357
To the choir.

1:43:54.734 --> 1:43:55.735
To the choir.

1:43:57.862 --> 1:43:59.531
Group photo, everyone.

1:44:00.281 --> 1:44:01.491
All right, everybody in.

1:44:02.701 --> 1:44:03.827
Everybody.

1:44:04.285 --> 1:44:06.079
Right, ready?

1:44:06.746 --> 1:44:08.456
OK, everyone say, "Cheese!"

1:44:08.540 --> 1:44:11.543
- We did it, ladies.
- Yeah!

1:44:12.711 --> 1:44:14.087
You should feel very proud.

1:44:14.671 --> 1:44:15.839
I'm very proud of you.

1:44:17.257 --> 1:44:18.550
- Hey, Crooks!
- Bye-bye.

1:44:18.633 --> 1:44:20.844
How about enhancing
the spousal experience

1:44:20.927 --> 1:44:23.096
by riding with Richard
so Kate can come with us?

1:44:27.017 --> 1:44:28.101
She's all yours.

1:44:29.519 --> 1:44:31.354
Yeah!

1:44:31.980 --> 1:44:33.273
<i>She's on the coach</i>

1:44:34.441 --> 1:44:35.942
<i>She's on the coach</i>

1:44:36.026 --> 1:44:37.736
- Take care of that, Captain.
- Of course, sir.

1:44:39.029 --> 1:44:40.155
Welcome to Dave.

1:44:50.123 --> 1:44:52.375
Is Sarah here? Did she turn up?

1:44:52.667 --> 1:44:53.710
Oh, she's there.

1:45:05.597 --> 1:45:08.224
We're gonna do the same places
as at the Albert Hall.

1:45:08.308 --> 1:45:11.394
Will you come down? We'll start
with something fun and easy.

1:45:11.811 --> 1:45:13.438
Round the back. There we go.

1:45:18.443 --> 1:45:22.113
<i>Everyone can see we're together</i>

1:45:22.530 --> 1:45:25.325
<i>As we walk on by</i>

1:45:26.409 --> 1:45:29.871
<i>And we fly just like birds
of a feather</i>

1:45:30.538 --> 1:45:32.749
<i>I won't tell no lie</i>

1:45:32.832 --> 1:45:33.833
<i>All</i>

1:45:33.917 --> 1:45:37.796
<i>All of the people
around us, they say</i>

1:45:38.380 --> 1:45:40.507
<i>Can they be that close?</i>

1:45:41.424 --> 1:45:43.843
<i>Just let me state for the record</i>

1:45:45.470 --> 1:45:49.015
<i>We're givin' love in a family dose</i>

1:45:49.099 --> 1:45:51.518
