WEBVTT

00:03.600 --> 00:05.033
They got us trained
to use the cash machine.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.394
We're chickens in an experiment...

00:06.560 --> 00:08.630
...waiting for that pellet
to come down the shoot.

00:08.840 --> 00:12.071
You see people at the cash machine.
They're just there.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.314
Waiting for the sound.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.392
You're waiting for the sound.
That's what we're trained to hear.

00:19.560 --> 00:22.199
The here-comes-the-money sound,
you know?

00:24.480 --> 00:26.869
It's exciting. Don't you get excited?

00:28.400 --> 00:30.550
"It's coming. It's coming.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.950
They're giving me money."

00:38.880 --> 00:41.440
Hey, I gotta get some cash.
I'm gonna run down to the ATM.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.790
-Yeah, I gotta grab some too.
-I'll get it for you.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.712
Just give me your card.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.390
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, just tell me your code.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.233
My code?

00:54.720 --> 00:57.792
-So why didn't you tell her the code?
-No way.

00:57.960 --> 01:01.111
George, you're gonna
marry this woman, most likely.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.436
It says very clearly,
"For your protection...

01:03.600 --> 01:06.319
...do not give your secret code
to anyone."

01:06.520 --> 01:09.478
So you're taking relationship advice
from Chemical Bank now?

01:10.200 --> 01:12.760
Why does everything have to be "us"?
Is there no "me" left?

01:12.920 --> 01:16.276
Why can't there be some things
just for me? Is that so selfish?

01:16.480 --> 01:18.710
Actually, that's the definition
of selfish.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.433
Have you given your code
to anyone?

01:20.640 --> 01:23.791
No one's ever asked. Do you want it?
It's Jor-El.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.514
-Superman's father on Krypton.
-Of course.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.990
Come on, Georgie,
you know you wanna tell me.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.391
It's eating you up inside.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.473
Sing it, sister.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.753
No. No, I am not giving my code
to anyone for any reason.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.957
What if my life depended on it?

01:41.080 --> 01:43.958
If you're in some situation where
fast cash will save your life...

01:44.120 --> 01:45.838
...I'll give you the code.

01:47.680 --> 01:50.035
-What's the matter with your leg?
-My foot fell asleep.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.589
-How did your foot fall asleep?
-I crossed my legs.

01:52.760 --> 01:54.432
I forgot to alternate.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.919
-Hey, Jerry, George.
-Hey, Fred.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.718
-Hey, Freddie.
-Foot fell asleep.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.434
You're lucky. At least you got
something to do.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.119
-Hey, Fred, do you know Elaine?
-No.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.714
Nice to meet you. Well, I'm out of here.
See you, guys.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.478
-All right, Fred.
-See you.

02:10.240 --> 02:12.674
Did you hear that?
He said, "Nice to meet you."

02:13.080 --> 02:16.038
-So?
-So we've met before.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.192
At Katie Ash's party.
We talked for, like, 10 minutes.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.152
And he didn't remember you?

02:21.800 --> 02:25.429
-Where are you going?
-I gotta go talk to him.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.596
Excuse me. Excuse me, Fred.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.716
-Yeah.
-Hi.

02:30.920 --> 02:34.037
You just said, "Nice to meet you,"
but actually we've met before.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.800
-We have?
-Yeah. Yeah, at Katie Ash's party.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.433
What was your name again?

02:38.600 --> 02:41.433
Elaine. You don't remember
our conversation?

02:41.600 --> 02:43.636
I talked about how
my uncle worked...

02:43.800 --> 02:46.519
...in the book depository building
with Lee Harvey Oswald.

02:47.480 --> 02:48.754
Not ringing a bell.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.798
When my uncle said to him,
"The president's been shot"...

02:51.960 --> 02:54.872
...Oswald winked at him and said,
"I'm gonna go catch a movie."

02:56.880 --> 02:58.836
-No.
-Right when we were in front of...

02:59.000 --> 03:01.389
-...the bathroom door.
-The bathroom door.

03:01.560 --> 03:05.030
I remember someone had played
tic-tac-toe on it and the X's won.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.909
They went diagonally from
the top left to the bottom right.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.956
Sounds great. I'd love to do
some TV commercials.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.633
That should really be fun.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.190
Okay. All right, bye.
How do you like that?

03:22.400 --> 03:24.914
I'm gonna do TV spots
for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.640
That was Leapin' Larry himself.
I'm gonna meet him tomorrow.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.756
Leapin' Larry.
That's where I bought this.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.474
-What is that?
-It's an emergency-band scanner.

03:32.640 --> 03:36.269
It picks up everything;
fires, harbour patrol, even the police.

03:36.440 --> 03:39.000
I'm watching the watchers, Jerry.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.629
We got a big fire on 115th.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.315
I tell you, if I could do it over again,
I'd give it all up to be a fireman.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.318
Yeah, those civil servants who
risk their lives really got it made.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.756
Yeah. When I was a kid,
all I ever dreamed of...

03:53.920 --> 03:56.514
...was steering the back
of that big hook-and-ladder.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.870
You're lucky they let you drive a car.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.030
No, no, no. They're taking
the West Side Highway.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.031
At this time of day? That's insane.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.760
They're heading
straight into gridlock.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.951
Oh, those fools.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.395
What was that? All right.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.199
So get a load of this.

04:15.360 --> 04:16.713
This guy, Fred Yerkes...

04:16.880 --> 04:20.759
...remembers every little thing
about that night except me.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.309
Really? I'm surprised.
He doesn't meet that many women.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.239
So, what are you saying?

04:26.680 --> 04:29.433
What's to be said.
He didn't remember you.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.473
Yeah, but why? I mean...

04:34.160 --> 04:35.593
...you know.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.034
I know.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.117
-You know?
-Yeah, I know.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.669
-You got the new catalogue.
-Yeah. Good piece...

04:42.840 --> 04:45.513
-...on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
-Too good. Peterman was so pleased...

04:45.680 --> 04:48.114
...now he wants to take me
out to dinner tomorrow.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.589
-Maybe you wanna come.
-Why would I wanna do that?

04:50.800 --> 04:52.358
Please, Jerry.
Please, please, please.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.590
I can't sit with him.
He tells these stories.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.955
It's gonna be awful.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.394
Yeah, sounds like fun.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.672
I want you to tell me, George.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.478
Why? Why is my code
so important?

05:04.640 --> 05:06.437
Because it's part of our relationship.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.272
It's an indication of trust.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.670
We're not supposed to
keep secrets from one another.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.916
I'm sure you have secrets from me.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.640
I don't know anything
about your cycles.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.478
-My cycles?
-I never know what's going on there.

05:20.840 --> 05:24.230
Well, from now on,
I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.476
-Please.
-Anything else?

05:27.640 --> 05:29.392
We're out of Bosco.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.309
How about this?
"Come on down to Leapin' Larry's.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.636
If you beat our prices,
we'll give you the store."

05:37.400 --> 05:39.072
You know, I've always liked
your comedy.

05:39.240 --> 05:42.073
-You don't take cheap shots.
-No, I don't.

05:42.280 --> 05:45.955
I'm sorry for keeping you so long.
Again, I apologize for the mess.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.555
This renovation is killing me.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.358
My foot's asleep again.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.313
When I lost my leg
in the boating accident last year...

05:53.520 --> 05:56.910
...I got so depressed
about this damn prosthetic...

05:57.080 --> 05:59.640
...I thought I was gonna have to
give up the business.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.997
But now, I'm rejuvenated.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.515
Let me show you around the store.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.240
You know what,
I'll be with you in a minute.

06:15.320 --> 06:18.835
That is a great impression.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.591
Larry, wait, you don't understand.

06:27.320 --> 06:31.029
I just came from Leapin' Larry's.
What, making fun of crippled people?

06:31.200 --> 06:32.599
Is that what you've sunk to?

06:32.800 --> 06:35.473
No, I didn't do it on purpose.
My foot fell asleep.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.079
Oh, your foot fell asleep.

06:37.280 --> 06:41.319
You know, the guy has one leg and
he still calls himself Leapin' Larry.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.152
You'd think he'd have
a sense of humour.

06:43.360 --> 06:46.830
You just joked yourself out of that
commercial, didn't you, munjamba?

06:48.760 --> 06:50.398
Yeah.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.393
Oh, boy. Look at that.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.755
See, that's that fire
I was listening to yesterday.

06:56.440 --> 06:57.793
The whole building burned down.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.791
They just don't know
what street to take.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.912
Remember I got us to Yankee Stadium
in rush hour in 15 minutes?

07:03.080 --> 07:05.150
-Of course.
-It's all up here, Jerry.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.880
All up here. It's innate.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.469
The amazing thing is
you never have any place to go.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.154
Where are we gonna eat?

07:14.320 --> 07:16.550
We're gonna meet Elaine and
Peterman at the Chinese place.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.751
Nobody mentioned
anything about Peterman.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.598
If I did, would you have gone?

07:20.800 --> 07:22.074
-No way.
-There you go.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.554
I don't even know Peterman.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.280
Now how am I gonna relax?
I'm gonna have to be on all night.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.749
I don't like being on, Jerry.
I'd much rather be off.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.712
Trust me, you're off.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.874
Oh, hi, Fred.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.513
Hello.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.473
-It's Elaine.
-Oh, yeah. Right.

07:41.680 --> 07:44.194
-Yeah. How you doing?
-I'm depressed.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.510
I got this new shirt.
The button fell off.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.399
Once the button falls off, that's it.
I'll never fix it.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.878
-Yeah, that's too bad.
-Yeah, I'm gonna get some vitamins.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.349
-I feel depleted.
-I never take them.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.351
They make you nauseous, right?

07:58.560 --> 08:01.597
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
You remembered.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.711
Do you wanna have dinner tonight?

08:05.080 --> 08:07.435
-Tonight?
-What, you have other plans?

08:07.920 --> 08:10.912
No, no, no. None that I can...

08:11.080 --> 08:12.991
...remember.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.798
All right. You're locked up in a prison
in Turkey. I have your wallet.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.235
The only way I can bribe the guards
to get you out...

08:22.440 --> 08:23.998
...is for you to give me
your ATM code.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.798
-Call the embassy.
-They're closed.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.156
-Why?
-Bomb threat.

08:29.360 --> 08:31.351
-We're in Turkey?
-Midnight Express, my friend.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.188
My card won't work.
They're not on the PLUS system.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.909
You must be Jerry Seinfeld.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.951
Yes. Hi, Mr. Peterman.

08:40.159 --> 08:42.037
This is George Costanza.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.519
J. Peterman.

08:43.679 --> 08:45.238
J. Crew.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.918
So is Elaine here?

08:50.840 --> 08:54.071
Oh, Elaine just called.
She won't be joining us.

08:54.280 --> 08:58.831
But not to worry. I'll tell the maû‘re d'
it'll just be the three bulls.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.236
What? He still wants to have dinner
with us?

09:04.440 --> 09:06.829
-Without Elaine? What for?
-What is he, crazy?

09:07.680 --> 09:09.193
Oh, we gotta get out of here.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.998
Come on, weave your web,
liar-man.

09:13.040 --> 09:16.476
-I got nothing. I-- I'm blank.
-Come on, George...

09:16.640 --> 09:19.632
-...what's the matter with you?
-I'm choking.

09:20.200 --> 09:23.112
Oh, Fong has been
most accommodating.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.589
-Shall we?
-Actually, I just remembered...

09:25.760 --> 09:28.274
...I promised this comedy club
that I'd do a set tonight.

09:28.440 --> 09:31.273
-I'm terribly sorry.
-I understand. No hard feelings.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.951
George and l
will miss your company.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.714
Fong, it will just
be two this evening.

09:37.880 --> 09:39.552
Well, George...

09:40.240 --> 09:42.390
...we dine.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.952
I can't believe this.
This guy's standing me up?

09:51.840 --> 09:56.960
And there, tucked into the river's bend,
was the object of my search...

09:57.160 --> 09:59.674
...the Guangia River Market.

09:59.840 --> 10:03.719
Fabrics and spices
traded under a starlit sky.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.717
It was there that I discovered
the Pamplona Beret.

10:08.280 --> 10:12.273
Sizes seven and a half through
eight and three quarters. Price, $35.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.837
What about sports?
You follow sports?

10:19.040 --> 10:22.191
It's fourth and inches and
the Giants are going for it.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.590
You've gotta love sports.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.876
You know, this is very nice,
but I really could take a cab, really--

10:29.040 --> 10:30.996
Nonsense, George.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.078
Besides, it gives me a chance to
tell you about my trip to Burma.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.518
I discovered a very unusual
corduroy.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.793
Peterman here.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.360
What? Oh, no.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.837
All right. I'll be right there.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.514
It's my mother.
She's at death's door.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.153
-What?
-I just pray to God...

10:53.360 --> 10:55.157
...we can make it there in time.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.790
I can't believe you blew us off.
We did you a favour.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.712
Well, Fred asked me out.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.755
-Fred?
-Yeah, and then he stood me up.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.399
I don't get this guy.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.953
You see what's going on here.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.395
You're attracted to him because
he can't remember you.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.710
I am? But that's so sick.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.353
That's God's plan.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.954
He doesn't really want anyone
to get together.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.959
Anyway, so how was the dinner?

11:20.600 --> 11:22.238
Well, when I heard
you weren't coming...

11:22.400 --> 11:24.550
...I made an excuse and
got the hell out of there.

11:24.840 --> 11:26.114
What about Georgie?

11:26.840 --> 11:29.229
He didn't make it.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.835
-Doctor, how is she?
-She's too weak to talk.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.516
-She'll be happy to hear you.
-Mama, it's me, Jacobo.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.836
I'm here for you, Mama.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.076
I'm George Costanza.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.755
I was having dinner with your son.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

12:01.280 --> 12:03.271
Shake off the dew, my friend.

12:03.440 --> 12:04.919
Oh, man.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.071
-What time is it?
-It's morning.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.390
Thanks for seeing me
through the night.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.437
I'll make us a pot of coffee, George.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.874
Watch her, won't you?

12:13.040 --> 12:15.031
-Who?
-Mama.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.798
Just talk to her, George.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.434
The doctor seems to think it helps.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.435
Hi. You know, I-- I--

12:31.640 --> 12:35.838
I really should be getting back
to my fiancée. You know, we....

12:36.000 --> 12:38.798
We had this big fight yesterday...

12:40.200 --> 12:44.034
...and, well, she wants to know
my secret code.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.558
I don't know. I can't tell her.

12:50.080 --> 12:53.868
The funny thing is, you know,
I would really love to tell someone...

12:54.040 --> 12:56.600
...because it's killing me.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.915
You wanna know what it is?

13:08.360 --> 13:10.237
It's Bosco.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.152
You know, the chocolate syrup.

13:12.320 --> 13:16.154
I love that stuff. I pour it in milk.
It's my favourite drink.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.312
Boy, that is a relief.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.754
Bosco.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.197
Bosco.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.479
-Bosco.
-Mama?

13:28.680 --> 13:31.638
-Quiet, quiet. It's a secret.
-Bosco! Bosco!

13:31.800 --> 13:36.191
-Shut up. It's a secret.
-Mama, what are you trying to say?

13:36.400 --> 13:38.516
Bosco.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.397
She's gone.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.510
Bosco?

13:54.960 --> 13:56.518
This never would have happened...

13:56.680 --> 13:59.717
-...if you hadn't bailed out on me.
-I did not bail out on you.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.757
Why couldn't you include me
in your excuse?

14:01.960 --> 14:03.678
Why didn't you
come up with your own?

14:03.840 --> 14:05.512
I froze.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.398
-I think I'm losing it.
-Oh, come on.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.835
-Maybe you're just in a slump.
-No, no.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.992
I reached down
and there was nothing there.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.996
Now Peterman wants me
to go to the funeral.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.714
Oh, come on, just tell me
your code already. What is it?

14:19.200 --> 14:21.509
I am not giving you my code.

14:22.360 --> 14:25.158
-I bet I can guess it.
-Yeah, right.

14:25.680 --> 14:28.274
Oh, all right. Yeah.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.749
Let's see.

14:30.920 --> 14:34.549
Well, we can throw out birthdays
immediately. That's too obvious.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.955
And no numbers for you.
You're a word man.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.878
All right. Let's go deeper.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.596
What kind of man are you?

14:41.760 --> 14:44.035
Well, you're weak, spineless.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.830
A man of temptations.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.594
But what tempts you?

14:50.040 --> 14:52.190
You're a portly fellow...

14:52.360 --> 14:54.590
...a little long in the waistband.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.111
So, what's your pleasure?

14:58.080 --> 15:00.640
Is it the salty snacks you crave?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.756
No, no, no.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.354
Yours is a sweet tooth.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.109
-Get out of here.
-Oh, you may stray...

15:09.280 --> 15:12.397
...but you'll always return
to your dark master...

15:12.560 --> 15:14.676
...the cocoa bean.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.638
-I'm leaving.
-And only the purest syrup nectar...

15:17.800 --> 15:19.153
-...can satisfy you.
-I gotta go.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.390
If you could,
you'd guzzle it by the gallon.

15:21.560 --> 15:25.599
-Ovaltine, Hershey's, Nestlé's Quik.
-Shut up! Shut up!

15:26.960 --> 15:28.757
-What was that?
-What?

15:28.920 --> 15:31.514
You just checked your watch.
Are you thinking of bailing?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.070
I got a date.

15:34.240 --> 15:37.073
-Oh, Mr. Peterman.
-Oh, Elaine.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.719
George.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.559
When Mama said "Bosco"...

15:41.720 --> 15:43.631
...she must have been
communicating something.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.597
Her legacy. A dying wish, perhaps.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.438
Mothers say things.

15:47.600 --> 15:51.149
My mother goes babbling on and on
like a crazy person.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.594
Mr. Peterman...

15:52.760 --> 15:55.320
...you have my deepest sympathies.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.276
Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.911
-You do?
-Yes, actually we both do.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.476
I have a personal commitment.

16:04.640 --> 16:08.235
-Well, personal-- I mean, we both....
-What is it?

16:08.400 --> 16:11.710
I'm speaking at a
woman's rights conference.

16:13.240 --> 16:17.518
Yes, and I'm speaking
at a men's conference.

16:17.680 --> 16:19.716
I don't believe that for a minute.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.034
-Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
-My pleasure.

16:23.200 --> 16:28.194
Fortunately, I still have George here
to help me through this.

16:29.040 --> 16:33.397
You know, George, growing up
as a boy in Costa Rica...

16:33.560 --> 16:36.711
...I heard a rumour that
Mama had taken a lover.

16:36.880 --> 16:40.156
Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.951
You wanna come to
the fire station with me?

16:44.120 --> 16:46.918
-Fire station?
-Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.593
I'm gonna rock their world.

16:48.760 --> 16:50.352
I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.556
-He took you back?
-Yeah, we straightened it out.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.039
-All is forgiven.
-You know...

16:54.200 --> 16:56.555
...the important thing is that
you learned something.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.790
No, I didn't.

17:00.440 --> 17:03.318
Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of shortcuts
is most impressive.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.038
This is just
the Upper West Side.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.832
Wait until I get to the Village.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.355
Then you're gonna see a magic show.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.154
Mr. Kramer, almost every week
some hothead like yourself...

17:12.359 --> 17:15.113
...saunters in here
talking about faster routes...

17:15.319 --> 17:17.310
-...and snazzier colours for the truck.
-Well, I--

17:17.480 --> 17:21.473
The fact is, we feel things are
fine the way they are.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.838
Thanks for having me back and
sorry about the misunderstanding.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.797
Water under the bridge.

17:27.960 --> 17:31.032
Come on. I never did get a chance to
show you around the store.

17:31.240 --> 17:32.639
Oh, sure.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.631
Oh, again.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.071
I'll be right there.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.437
Attention, company 390.
Structure fire...

17:48.600 --> 17:50.989
...at Leapin' Larry's
Appliance Warehouse.

17:51.480 --> 17:54.233
Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown.
You gotta take Amsterdam.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.949
-Stay out of this, Kramer.
-All right, men, let's move it.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.473
Pull those doors.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.311
Move. Move.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.391
Giddyup.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.556
Are you okay, cowboy?

18:17.120 --> 18:22.069
-Where do you need to go?
-I drive the back of the truck.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.070
You'd better take it easy.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.913
All right, 48, let's go. Let's go!

18:34.200 --> 18:36.111
Sorry about the other night.
My mother called.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.635
She couldn't find her pills.
I had to go into Brooklyn...

18:38.800 --> 18:40.916
...help her find the pills
and they were right in...

18:41.080 --> 18:43.992
...the medicine cabinet.
Could you believe that?

18:44.160 --> 18:46.833
The worst part is getting from
the subway station to the house.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.319
There's no transportation.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.192
What am I doing?

18:50.360 --> 18:54.990
I'm on a date with this guy
because he didn't remember me?

18:55.160 --> 18:56.673
He's demented. Listen to him.

18:56.840 --> 19:00.116
I could take a cab, but if my mother
saw me in a cab, she would yell at me;

19:00.280 --> 19:03.192
"Freddie, what are you taking
a cab for? It's so expensive."

19:03.480 --> 19:04.754
She's out of her mind.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.434
Eventually, you'll meet her.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.917
Bosco.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.870
Bosco.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.593
Bosco.

19:15.960 --> 19:19.555
There's a big fire down the street.
The whole block is going up in flames.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.759
George.

19:28.440 --> 19:30.271
We're gonna make a left
onto Broadway.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.557
No, I would advise against that.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.676
-Who is this?
-It's Kramer.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.591
Kramer?

19:39.160 --> 19:40.752
What are you doing back there?

19:40.920 --> 19:43.912
Desota's down,
but Cosmo's got the caboose.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.158
-How did this start?
-Beats me.

19:50.840 --> 19:54.230
Where the hell is the fire department?
I'm gonna lose the whole store.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.232
Kramer, get the hell out of there.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.311
You're not trained to
operate this equipment.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.198
-Hey, Kramer!
-Hey!

20:01.360 --> 20:03.157
Pay attention, Kramer!

20:03.320 --> 20:05.788
Hey, try the scanner.
See if you can pick up anything.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.990
What are you doing, Kramer?
You're all over the road.

20:11.160 --> 20:14.072
-Don't worry, cap, I can handle it.
-Kramer?

20:17.480 --> 20:19.232
You're losing control.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.392
Hard right! Hard right!

20:22.920 --> 20:25.070
We're never gonna to make it!

20:28.400 --> 20:29.958
That's a shame.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.435
This fire's gonna eat up
this entire block.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.514
George, look. There's a man in there.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.079
Get out. You're in danger.

20:37.240 --> 20:40.391
My sleeve, it's stuck in the machine.
It ate my card.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.118
George, give me your ATM card.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.032
I don't have my ATM card.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.475
George, you're obviously lying.
Anyone can see that.

20:52.280 --> 20:53.713
It's jammed.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.314
I'll slide it under the door.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.071
-Now give me your code.
-What? Why?

21:00.240 --> 21:02.037
The machine won't open
without the code.

21:02.240 --> 21:03.798
-George, give him your code.
-But I--

21:03.960 --> 21:06.474
George, there's no time.
Tell him your code.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.153
Shout out your code, man.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.715
Code! The code!

21:20.960 --> 21:22.837
Hi.

21:24.840 --> 21:27.354
-Here's your cash, George.
-Thanks.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.919
And here's your card back.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.790
Anyone for Bosco?

21:35.200 --> 21:37.270
Oh, my God.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.158
-Look at this.
-What?

21:39.320 --> 21:41.436
It's the new J. Peterman catalogue.
Look, look.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.439
"The Rogue's Wallet.

21:44.600 --> 21:48.036
It's where he kept his card,
his dirty little secret.

21:48.200 --> 21:51.192
Short, devious, balding...

21:51.360 --> 21:53.828
...his name was Costanza.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.230
He killed my mother."
