WEBVTT

00:31.106 --> 00:31.940
Marcy.

00:38.415 --> 00:42.485
Oh my god.

01:46.416 --> 01:48.551
Three million
dollar drug smuggling ring.

01:48.585 --> 01:50.420
22 pounds of heroin was seized,

01:50.453 --> 01:52.054
along with a small
amount of cocaine,

01:52.087 --> 01:53.923
marijuana, and ecstasy.

01:53.957 --> 01:55.892
Police say the ring was
centered in Columbia,

01:55.925 --> 01:58.895
with drugs spiking away
in large city centers.

01:58.928 --> 02:02.532
25 people have been
arrested and face charges.

02:16.579 --> 02:18.146
Marcy.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.782
Harvey's left six
messages already,

02:19.816 --> 02:20.817
and he said he emailed you.

02:20.850 --> 02:22.351
He's probably freaking me out.

02:22.385 --> 02:24.119
- Who?
- Harvey.

02:24.152 --> 02:26.088
He, you fired him on Friday.

02:26.121 --> 02:27.423
Okay, I'll deal with it.

02:28.691 --> 02:30.660
Should I call head
office or the police?

02:30.693 --> 02:32.395
Yeah,
I'll deal with it.

02:34.263 --> 02:36.365
Do you need to go home?

03:24.212 --> 03:25.582
We're downtown.

03:25.615 --> 03:28.116
It's a man, his name's
Harvey, he used to work here.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.322
Marcy, Marcy!

03:46.201 --> 03:47.403
No!

03:50.506 --> 03:51.908
No, no, wait!

03:55.143 --> 03:57.112
Take a guess.

03:59.082 --> 04:00.950
Hey!

04:00.984 --> 04:01.718
Guess.

04:39.889 --> 04:41.724
Can somebody help!

04:41.758 --> 04:42.592
Help!

04:45.561 --> 04:46.896
Help!

04:46.929 --> 04:48.431
323 to 584.

04:48.464 --> 04:50.500
Marcy fired him on Friday.

04:50.533 --> 04:51.768
His name's Harvey.

04:51.801 --> 04:54.671
When he came in today,
I just, I don't know,

04:54.704 --> 04:56.139
I have so much going on.

04:56.171 --> 04:59.976
And then he started going
from office to office,

05:00.009 --> 05:03.446
and I heard bang, bang.

05:03.479 --> 05:05.915
And then he went
into the bathroom,

05:05.948 --> 05:08.518
and I don't, I was
trying to get Marcy.

05:12.287 --> 05:14.222
Pure dereliction.

05:14.256 --> 05:16.959
And your secretary said you
were drunk on top of it.

05:20.797 --> 05:21.597
Help!

05:21.631 --> 05:23.132
Take some time.

05:23.166 --> 05:25.735
Sort yourself out, Marcy.

05:25.768 --> 05:28.771
When you get yourself together
we'll talk about your future.

05:32.775 --> 05:34.010
Help!

05:56.065 --> 05:58.868
Hey, don't
worry about any of that.

05:58.901 --> 06:00.803
We just wanna see you.

06:00.837 --> 06:02.004
Just come here.

06:23.659 --> 06:26.662
Hey, don't worry
about any of that.

06:26.696 --> 06:28.631
We just wanna see you.

06:28.664 --> 06:29.999
Just come here.

08:22.378 --> 08:23.379
Are you all right?

08:30.219 --> 08:32.421
Lucky for you we
have an empty house.

08:33.789 --> 08:35.491
How long do you
think you'll stay?

08:38.094 --> 08:39.729
Few days, maybe.

08:39.762 --> 08:40.596
Of course.

08:48.537 --> 08:50.072
Sign right here, please.

09:03.953 --> 09:04.787
Marcy.

09:06.355 --> 09:07.189
Pretty name.

09:08.424 --> 09:10.092
This building is quite old.

09:10.126 --> 09:11.694
It's been many things
over the years,

09:11.727 --> 09:14.764
a hospital, a hotel, a bar.

09:19.235 --> 09:20.603
What happened here?

09:20.636 --> 09:22.171
One of the owners was shot.

09:25.174 --> 09:28.311
Bright Hill Road has a long
and complicated history,

09:28.344 --> 09:30.479
as many of the older houses do.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.516
The bathroom is shared.

09:33.549 --> 09:35.284
Like the kitchen, keep it tidy.

09:35.318 --> 09:37.486
Be respectful of your
neighbors' needs.

09:38.988 --> 09:41.857
No noise after 11,
no overnight guests

09:41.891 --> 09:43.759
unless they are paying guests.

09:43.793 --> 09:45.127
No cooking in your room.

10:00.676 --> 10:01.777
It saves on dusting.

10:21.398 --> 10:24.300
A mirror is the
window to the soul.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.402
It's the eyes.

10:27.471 --> 10:30.440
The eyes are the
window to the soul.

10:31.674 --> 10:32.508
Hm.

10:34.010 --> 10:35.077
Perhaps you're right.

10:48.557 --> 10:50.960
I would be happy to get
your bags from your car.

10:50.993 --> 10:52.396
Oh.

10:52.429 --> 10:53.763
Thank you.

10:53.796 --> 10:54.663
It's in my trunk.

10:57.666 --> 10:58.534
You rest now.

15:58.267 --> 15:59.101
One.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.273
Happy new year.

17:09.171 --> 17:10.540
It's Mia,
you know what to do.

17:10.573 --> 17:12.908
Mia, it's me.

17:14.377 --> 17:16.945
Don't worry, you can pick
up, I'm not drunk dialing.

17:29.024 --> 17:30.627
You know, there's a
crucifix on the closet

17:30.660 --> 17:32.529
where I'm staying,
Dad would approve.

17:34.129 --> 17:35.164
I made a new thing.

17:36.599 --> 17:40.670
Do you remember the photo of
us in front of the old house?

17:40.703 --> 17:43.440
The one of you, me, Dad.

17:45.675 --> 17:46.509
It's that.

17:51.079 --> 17:52.114
Fucked up pretty bad.

17:54.451 --> 17:55.951
Maybe you heard, I don't know.

17:57.587 --> 18:00.390
But I think I'm gonna come
stay with you for a few days.

18:01.624 --> 18:02.659
A few weeks, maybe.

18:03.927 --> 18:04.761
Hope that's okay.

18:06.830 --> 18:08.531
You can shove it.

18:09.566 --> 18:10.400
Okay?

18:12.802 --> 18:13.903
I'm quitting drinking.

18:16.338 --> 18:20.410
Gonna quit mucking
it up for good.

18:23.212 --> 18:24.980
And you can shove it.

18:26.081 --> 18:27.115
And you can shove it.

18:28.785 --> 18:30.787
Everyone can shove it.

18:30.820 --> 18:32.755
Well, I guess I
will see you soon.

18:36.693 --> 18:38.828
You might wanna
hide the matches.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.434
Mia?

18:46.469 --> 18:47.302
Hello?

20:07.617 --> 20:09.652
No, no, no, you
can't go in there,

20:09.686 --> 20:11.387
your father's in there.

20:11.421 --> 20:12.254
It's okay.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.925
He died in a fire.

20:54.697 --> 20:55.832
Good morning.

20:55.865 --> 20:57.366
Morning.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.036
There's some tea and coffee
on the table, help yourself.

21:13.850 --> 21:14.917
Everything all right?

21:15.752 --> 21:16.753
Everything's fine.

21:46.181 --> 21:46.983
Mrs. Inman?

21:58.761 --> 21:59.762
Hello?

23:51.741 --> 23:52.909
Good evening, Marcy.

23:55.812 --> 23:57.280
Did you need something?

23:57.312 --> 24:00.850
No, no, I was just feeling
a little claustrophobic,

24:00.883 --> 24:04.587
so I thought I'd come see if
there was something to read.

24:04.620 --> 24:06.222
Oh, be my guest.

24:12.662 --> 24:13.930
If you'll excuse me then.

25:11.420 --> 25:12.521
Mrs. Inman?

27:11.974 --> 27:13.909
Marcy.

27:13.943 --> 27:15.111
Get me a beer.

27:16.245 --> 27:19.915
My daughter, the
godless little bitch.

27:56.552 --> 27:57.421
Nope.

27:58.320 --> 27:59.489
You weren't there.

28:00.556 --> 28:03.759
You are with God, old man.

28:24.980 --> 28:26.082
I'm not you.

29:33.849 --> 29:35.519
Blow out the candle.

29:55.605 --> 29:56.872
Mia.

29:56.906 --> 29:58.841
Mia, oh.

29:58.874 --> 30:00.544
I'm sick.

30:00.577 --> 30:02.344
I know.

30:02.379 --> 30:05.347
What, I know.

30:05.382 --> 30:07.517
You didn't call me back.

30:07.551 --> 30:09.553
I'm waiting
for you here, Marcy.

30:11.454 --> 30:13.456
I'm waiting for you here.

30:13.490 --> 30:15.758
I know, I'm sick.

30:15.791 --> 30:16.859
I have the flu.

30:17.826 --> 30:19.396
I have Dad's flu.

30:38.781 --> 30:40.249
Go away!

30:40.282 --> 30:42.151
Leave me alone, I'm sick.

30:55.465 --> 30:59.268
Please let me in, I'm
sick, I have the flu!

30:59.301 --> 31:00.670
Marcy.

31:17.052 --> 31:19.221
Let me in, let me in!

31:27.830 --> 31:29.231
Marcy.

31:48.752 --> 31:51.388
It was an accident, I'm sorry.

32:00.764 --> 32:01.997
I've heard it all before.

32:03.566 --> 32:05.100
I've seen it all before, too.

32:06.436 --> 32:08.438
I had a husband
who used to drink.

32:12.207 --> 32:15.110
It's been a
difficult few weeks.

32:18.381 --> 32:20.550
Drink up slowly, your
stomach is still raw.

32:20.583 --> 32:21.651
Better in than out.

32:27.490 --> 32:30.859
I think your house is haunted.

32:30.893 --> 32:31.728
Is it?

32:49.912 --> 32:50.913
Oh.

32:50.946 --> 32:52.415
Well, you're looking brighter.

32:54.617 --> 32:57.520
You know, I don't think you're
in any shape to go anywhere.

32:57.554 --> 33:00.055
I hope you're not
intending to leave.

33:00.089 --> 33:01.190
It's just a hangover.

33:02.726 --> 33:04.259
My sister is expecting me.

33:04.293 --> 33:07.129
It's
not a hangover, dear.

33:07.162 --> 33:09.031
What's your experiencing
is withdrawal,

33:09.064 --> 33:10.265
it can be quite serious.

33:10.299 --> 33:11.967
Trust me, I know
from experience.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.470
Look, I don't know
what you think you know...

33:13.503 --> 33:15.538
I'm not a fancy shrink,
but I can tell you

33:15.572 --> 33:18.874
that everyone reaches a point
where they have to reevaluate.

33:18.907 --> 33:20.677
It's part of the
human condition.

33:20.710 --> 33:22.144
There's no shame in it.

33:22.177 --> 33:23.780
You know, I don't think
I properly thanked you

33:23.813 --> 33:25.013
for last night.

33:25.047 --> 33:27.015
I know a woman in
crisis when I see one.

33:29.786 --> 33:30.620
You know,

33:33.889 --> 33:36.860
I hope you can feel
that you can talk to me.

33:39.396 --> 33:40.497
I'm very discreet.

33:41.698 --> 33:43.265
Everyone who comes
here has a secret.

33:47.404 --> 33:48.237
I'm fine.

33:50.507 --> 33:52.409
Unburdening cleanses the soul.

33:55.177 --> 33:56.479
Why do you care so much?

33:57.913 --> 34:00.583
Because we're all in
this together, aren't we?

34:00.617 --> 34:01.618
I'm a good listener.

34:02.552 --> 34:03.386
Noted.

34:04.319 --> 34:05.154
Thank you.

34:09.324 --> 34:12.429
Oh, there's stacks
of old magazines

34:12.462 --> 34:14.497
in the basement if
you're interested.

34:14.531 --> 34:17.332
Don't mind the mess,
accumulation of lifetimes.

36:36.806 --> 36:38.007
Are you going somewhere?

36:40.043 --> 36:41.978
I just need some air.

36:42.011 --> 36:44.047
I don't think I
recommend that, Marcy.

36:45.448 --> 36:46.449
I'll be back soon.

38:14.202 --> 38:16.439
That man was drunk, you weren't
there, you didn't see it!

38:16.472 --> 38:18.107
Drunk in the middle of
the day, driving a car,

38:18.141 --> 38:19.676
does that seem unlikely to you?

38:23.379 --> 38:24.647
You're upset for
the same reasons

38:24.681 --> 38:26.115
that brought you here, Marcy.

38:27.950 --> 38:31.387
I am here because I am
on my way to California

38:31.421 --> 38:32.354
to visit my sister.

38:32.388 --> 38:33.556
I know.

38:33.589 --> 38:35.758
Oh, you've had a very
hard time, Marcy.

38:35.792 --> 38:38.661
With your sister and
your father and the fire.

38:42.131 --> 38:43.365
How do you know anything...

38:43.399 --> 38:45.068
You left your art
things lying about.

38:46.368 --> 38:48.671
Come here, sweetheart,
tell me about the fire.

38:50.205 --> 38:51.339
It was an accident.

38:51.373 --> 38:52.642
And did you cause
this accident?

38:59.782 --> 39:01.651
I think it's time
for me to leave.

39:01.684 --> 39:02.518
Marcy.

39:03.986 --> 39:05.021
Marcy!

40:06.616 --> 40:07.750
It's Mia,
you know what to do.

40:08.584 --> 40:10.386
Hey, it's me.

40:12.121 --> 40:14.257
I don't know if you'll get this,
reception is terrible here,

40:14.289 --> 40:15.691
but I'm coming.

40:15.725 --> 40:17.126
I'll see you in a day or so.

40:18.694 --> 40:19.529
Okay.

40:32.875 --> 40:34.410
I'm sorry to see you go.

40:37.013 --> 40:38.748
Are you sure you're up for it?

40:38.781 --> 40:40.616
I'd just like to
check out, please.

40:42.919 --> 40:44.554
You don't look well.

40:44.587 --> 40:46.689
You know, quitting cold
turkey can be quite damaging.

40:46.722 --> 40:48.658
Thank you for your concern.

41:14.283 --> 41:15.117
Key.

41:22.859 --> 41:26.361
I hope your stay was
fruitful in some way.

41:27.296 --> 41:28.097
Thank you.

42:08.504 --> 42:09.338
Marcy!

42:10.406 --> 42:11.807
Come back inside!

42:31.260 --> 42:32.895
You need to rest.

42:37.199 --> 42:38.402
Too much at once.

42:57.353 --> 42:58.554
You can't come with me.

42:59.722 --> 43:00.690
You need to get out.

43:01.791 --> 43:03.526
Just
drive the car, Marcy.

43:04.727 --> 43:06.662
You can't tell me
what to do anymore.

43:07.697 --> 43:08.764
You're not God.

43:09.999 --> 43:11.968
God is
not the problem.

43:13.135 --> 43:13.970
No.

43:15.304 --> 43:17.039
I got him with me right here.

43:20.710 --> 43:22.078
I didn't shoot that gun.

43:23.479 --> 43:26.282
I didn't light that fire, it
was an accident, you know that.

43:32.456 --> 43:34.623
You were there, you
were both there.

43:34.657 --> 43:37.394
Your sister tells a
different story, doesn't she?

43:37.427 --> 43:39.463
I love my sister.

43:39.495 --> 43:42.432
The mirror is the
window to the soul.

43:42.466 --> 43:45.634
You got a car coming,
don't muck it up.

45:52.596 --> 45:53.430
Hello?

45:56.065 --> 45:57.299
Is someone there?

46:10.946 --> 46:12.114
Get lost!

46:45.649 --> 46:46.449
Boo!

46:48.184 --> 46:50.152
What the hell are you doing?

46:50.186 --> 46:51.787
Nothing.

46:51.820 --> 46:54.356
I was just having a
little bit of fun.

46:54.391 --> 46:56.125
Didn't you watch horror
movies when you were a kid?

46:56.158 --> 46:57.661
- No.
- Oh.

46:58.961 --> 46:59.795
Should have.

47:02.666 --> 47:04.434
Anyway, I'm here, too.

47:04.467 --> 47:06.101
That's me right down the hall.

47:06.135 --> 47:09.506
I'm Owen, and we're neighbors.

47:09.539 --> 47:10.372
Okay.

47:11.541 --> 47:13.042
What were you doing
outside my door, Owen?

47:13.075 --> 47:15.110
That's the thing, you know
the lady who runs the joint,

47:15.144 --> 47:17.813
she says we're the
only two people here.

47:17.846 --> 47:19.482
That's kinda weird.

47:19.516 --> 47:20.916
So I thought we should meet.

47:23.018 --> 47:24.353
So hi.

47:28.658 --> 47:30.460
You don't look so well.

47:30.493 --> 47:31.327
Are you okay?

47:34.397 --> 47:35.498
I've had a cold.

47:35.532 --> 47:36.365
Oh.

47:37.534 --> 47:40.302
Yeah, you gotta stay
on top of your health.

47:40.336 --> 47:42.271
They say you only got
one life before.

47:44.574 --> 47:45.408
You know?

47:49.512 --> 47:50.346
Yeah.

47:53.383 --> 47:54.883
I think I'm gonna hit the hay.

47:56.586 --> 47:57.987
It was nice to meet you...

47:59.221 --> 48:00.457
- Marcy.
- Marcy.

48:01.323 --> 48:02.559
That's a very pretty name.

48:05.695 --> 48:06.996
You look awfully familiar.

48:07.963 --> 48:08.797
No I don't.

48:11.300 --> 48:12.901
Stay the fuck away from my door.

48:55.944 --> 48:57.880
I met the new tenant last night.

48:59.616 --> 49:01.917
He was hanging around
outside my door.

49:03.052 --> 49:05.422
He was purposely
trying to scare me.

49:05.455 --> 49:06.656
Really?

49:06.690 --> 49:08.692
Yes, he tried to
come in my room.

49:08.725 --> 49:09.992
Perhaps he mistook it for his.

49:10.025 --> 49:11.293
I'm sure it won't happen again.

49:11.327 --> 49:12.861
No, it wasn't a mistake.

49:14.363 --> 49:16.633
It wasn't a mistake!

49:16.666 --> 49:18.601
Well, we get all
kinds here, Marcy,

49:18.635 --> 49:20.470
so many kinds of people.

49:20.503 --> 49:23.238
Good, bad, some famous, too,

49:23.272 --> 49:25.107
although I'm not supposed
to tell you that.

49:25.140 --> 49:26.443
Famous?

49:26.476 --> 49:30.680
Oh, perhaps notorious
is a better word.

49:31.748 --> 49:33.849
But privacy is important.

49:34.983 --> 49:36.586
Everybody's on
their own journey.

49:38.887 --> 49:40.390
People don't like it
known that they've stayed

49:40.423 --> 49:43.258
in a boarding house, there's
an element of sordid to it.

49:44.126 --> 49:44.960
Really?

49:47.363 --> 49:50.265
Not you, of course,
but let's see.

49:51.768 --> 49:53.902
Well, without naming names.

49:55.672 --> 49:58.742
There is a woman who
stayed here some time ago.

49:58.775 --> 50:03.713
She was an angry,
bitter, miserable woman.

50:03.747 --> 50:05.482
She felt like the whole
world was against her,

50:05.515 --> 50:08.451
but really it was the fault of
her no-good drunken husband.

50:09.985 --> 50:11.788
He owned this place
for some time.

50:13.857 --> 50:17.092
Anyway, she shot him.

50:23.065 --> 50:23.999
In the stairwell?

50:27.470 --> 50:28.303
Was that you?

50:30.305 --> 50:32.074
Bright Hill Road
has been a way station

50:32.107 --> 50:34.109
for all kinds of people.

50:34.143 --> 50:36.311
And some of these people are
doing penance for their sins,

50:36.345 --> 50:37.881
no names.

50:37.913 --> 50:40.517
And the new tenant,
is he murderous?

50:41.684 --> 50:44.754
Bright Hill Road
does not pry or judge.

51:00.302 --> 51:01.336
Good morning, Marcy.

51:05.107 --> 51:06.308
Are you still mad at me?

51:09.044 --> 51:11.079
Look, we're the only
two people here.

51:11.113 --> 51:13.483
It's gonna make the
hallway awkward.

51:13.516 --> 51:14.983
And the kitchen,
and the bathroom.

51:15.017 --> 51:15.951
It wasn't funny.

51:17.554 --> 51:18.455
Don't do it again.

51:19.856 --> 51:20.690
Witch's honor.

51:24.226 --> 51:25.093
"Bewitched"?

51:30.533 --> 51:33.603
So how long you
gonna be here anyway?

51:35.438 --> 51:36.606
I'm leaving today.

51:36.639 --> 51:38.173
Today, I just got here.

51:40.042 --> 51:41.176
Have you stayed here before?

51:41.210 --> 51:43.979
Nope, why, is it
haunted, bedbugs, what?

51:44.012 --> 51:46.148
No, more like mold
or asbestos or something.

51:46.181 --> 51:46.982
Gross.

51:47.884 --> 51:50.520
Yeah.

51:50.553 --> 51:51.921
God, you look familiar.

51:53.523 --> 51:54.323
Where you from?

51:56.593 --> 51:57.560
You don't know me.

51:59.762 --> 52:00.563
Maybe.

52:02.932 --> 52:07.269
Or maybe I'm just thinking
of a time in my life

52:07.302 --> 52:08.805
when I had a real type.

52:17.380 --> 52:21.384
And maybe that type
was you, Marcy.

52:27.690 --> 52:28.525
Hi.

52:30.793 --> 52:31.961
But I'm a good boy now.

52:33.362 --> 52:34.864
I don't do that stuff anymore.

52:42.872 --> 52:43.706
Pleasant morning.

52:58.353 --> 52:59.856
You'll catch your
death if you go out there

52:59.889 --> 53:01.391
without a coat.

53:01.424 --> 53:02.825
I'm going to California.

53:02.859 --> 53:04.661
Are you
sure you're ready to leave?

53:04.694 --> 53:05.528
Yes.

53:06.829 --> 53:08.330
My sister's waiting for me.

53:26.348 --> 53:28.283
Have you ever had
this place inspected

53:29.385 --> 53:32.555
for mold or asbestos?

53:32.589 --> 53:37.493
Or is there some sort
of a coal plant nearby?

53:38.962 --> 53:41.229
Your system is adjusting
to being denied alcohol.

53:41.263 --> 53:43.332
I'm not an alcoholic.

53:51.908 --> 53:54.010
Your hands are shaking.

53:55.011 --> 53:56.579
I suspect you have headaches.

53:56.613 --> 53:59.616
In a few hours you'll
be at risk of seizure.

53:59.649 --> 54:01.784
Are you hearing anything
or seeing anything?

54:03.118 --> 54:05.588
My husband was a drunk,
remember, I know how this works.

54:06.789 --> 54:07.724
I'm just tired.

54:09.592 --> 54:10.426
Well.

54:14.697 --> 54:17.867
A nap is a little gift
we give ourselves.

54:22.137 --> 54:23.973
I'll bring this up.

54:24.007 --> 54:24.841
Okay.

55:01.411 --> 55:04.847
Did you make this and
put it in my room?

55:04.881 --> 55:06.015
No.

55:06.049 --> 55:08.117
I'm not much of an artist.

55:08.151 --> 55:09.152
I didn't make it.

55:10.318 --> 55:11.854
Are you sure?

55:11.888 --> 55:13.623
Perhaps you made it while
you were under the weather.

55:13.656 --> 55:17.493
I didn't make it, which
means Owen has been in my room.

55:17.527 --> 55:18.795
This has got to stop.

55:18.828 --> 55:20.596
Okay, I think you're
jumping to conclusions.

55:20.630 --> 55:22.832
There's no other explanation!

55:22.865 --> 55:24.366
Pretty sure I heard my name.

55:25.668 --> 55:27.503
You were in my room.

55:27.537 --> 55:28.336
No I wasn't.

55:28.370 --> 55:29.639
Did you make this?

55:29.672 --> 55:31.140
No.

55:31.174 --> 55:32.809
Yes you did!

55:32.842 --> 55:34.043
One of you made this,

55:34.077 --> 55:36.679
and you put it in my
portfolio, in my room!

55:36.713 --> 55:38.614
- You're a liar!
- Marcy!

55:38.648 --> 55:40.383
That is enough, calm yourself.

55:44.020 --> 55:44.854
Nope.

55:54.497 --> 55:55.865
It's Mia,
you know what to do.

55:56.733 --> 55:58.134
Hey, it's me.

55:59.936 --> 56:01.537
I really wish
you'd call me back.

56:05.742 --> 56:07.443
Everything's really
fucked up right now,

56:07.477 --> 56:12.482
and I kinda feel
like I'm losing it.

56:13.348 --> 56:14.249
You always know what to do.

56:17.520 --> 56:19.522
And I know, I know
what you're thinking,

56:19.555 --> 56:22.792
but I haven't had
a drink in days.

56:23.926 --> 56:27.697
I mean, I don't
even know how long.

56:30.600 --> 56:32.001
I could really use one.

56:33.236 --> 56:35.571
Hey, Dad was in my
dream last night.

56:36.506 --> 56:37.440
It was so crazy.

56:39.909 --> 56:40.843
Please call me.

56:52.889 --> 56:53.723
Hi.

56:55.725 --> 56:56.559
Hi.

56:57.960 --> 56:58.828
Peace offering.

57:03.132 --> 57:04.000
It's not Passover.

57:04.033 --> 57:05.067
Do you really care?

57:08.905 --> 57:11.407
So anyway, I was thinking about
checking out the metropolis.

57:11.440 --> 57:12.775
I think you should join me.

57:12.809 --> 57:14.911
- You scare me.
- You still scare me too.

57:16.311 --> 57:18.748
So if you come with me,
I'll tell you my life story.

57:20.716 --> 57:21.551
Come on.

57:35.498 --> 57:37.200
Hey, you okay?

57:38.467 --> 57:40.269
Yeah, yeah.

57:40.303 --> 57:41.771
So far, I guess.

57:41.804 --> 57:43.406
Okay.

57:43.439 --> 57:44.574
Well I won't bite.

57:46.509 --> 57:47.877
Let's go.

57:47.910 --> 57:48.811
It's fucking cold.

57:55.218 --> 57:56.052
Come on.

57:58.187 --> 58:00.156
Why did you
move around so much?

58:02.525 --> 58:05.428
My dad, he was
one of those guys

58:05.461 --> 58:08.097
that was kinda
bad at everything.

58:08.130 --> 58:09.332
Yeah.

58:09.364 --> 58:11.400
He would get fired for
punching out the boss,

58:11.434 --> 58:14.503
and he'd get thrown in jail
for doing some other bad thing,

58:14.537 --> 58:16.239
and then he'd get
fired for that.

58:17.673 --> 58:21.377
My mom, she was ashamed,
so we just kept moving on.

58:21.410 --> 58:22.945
- Man, that's brutal.
- Mm-hm.

58:23.813 --> 58:24.714
Why are you going back, then?

58:24.747 --> 58:25.648
Where?

58:25.681 --> 58:26.515
Home.

58:27.683 --> 58:29.218
Home, well, home
is where you go

58:29.252 --> 58:31.787
where they have to
let you back in.

58:31.821 --> 58:34.323
And I'm not allowed to go
back to a lot of places.

58:37.560 --> 58:38.928
How about you,
what's your story?

58:38.961 --> 58:41.030
And why do you look
so damn familiar?

58:42.465 --> 58:43.299
Do you do porn?

58:44.533 --> 58:45.701
- Fuck off.
- You do porn.

58:45.735 --> 58:47.003
I'm kidding.

58:48.604 --> 58:49.572
So where you going?

58:50.940 --> 58:52.141
I'm going to
California to see my sister.

58:52.174 --> 58:54.710
California, is
she a movie star?

58:54.744 --> 58:57.313
No.

58:58.748 --> 59:03.486
Did you hear something last
night in one of the rooms?

59:04.086 --> 59:04.887
Like what?

59:07.456 --> 59:09.592
I don't know, a person crying.

59:11.360 --> 59:12.194
Nope.

59:23.239 --> 59:24.707
Oh, check that out.

59:25.875 --> 59:28.577
Lot of bored women
in a town like this.

59:28.611 --> 59:30.780
Oh my god, there
is something wrong with her.

59:31.781 --> 59:33.049
Nah, she's just wasted.

59:35.217 --> 59:38.120
Well, should we
try and stop her?

59:38.154 --> 59:39.522
Should we call
someone or something?

59:39.555 --> 59:40.890
No.

59:40.923 --> 59:42.091
Use a phone around here,

59:42.124 --> 59:43.559
there's not a cell
phone tower in miles.

59:48.164 --> 59:51.500
Look out!

59:54.404 --> 59:57.106
You see that?

59:57.139 --> 59:57.940
Oh my god.

59:57.974 --> 59:59.141
What's wrong?

59:59.175 --> 1:00:00.609
The driver.

1:00:00.643 --> 1:00:02.678
You're okay, it's okay,
that car missed us by a mile.

1:00:03.546 --> 1:00:05.915
The, the driver...

1:00:05.948 --> 1:00:07.049
That was fucked up.

1:00:13.289 --> 1:00:14.190
- Wait.
- What?

1:00:15.691 --> 1:00:16.492
What?

1:00:17.727 --> 1:00:20.062
- What's wrong?
- This has happened before.

1:00:20.096 --> 1:00:21.630
What's happened before?

1:00:21.664 --> 1:00:23.666
The car that almost hit us,

1:00:23.699 --> 1:00:26.669
that same thing
happened to me earlier.

1:00:26.702 --> 1:00:27.903
The same car?

1:00:27.937 --> 1:00:29.839
No, a different car,
but the same thing.

1:00:31.774 --> 1:00:34.677
There's a lot of bad
drivers in this town.

1:00:34.710 --> 1:00:36.045
No, there's...

1:00:37.513 --> 1:00:40.450
This place, okay, this whole,
whole place is something...

1:00:42.718 --> 1:00:44.520
Something's not right.

1:00:44.553 --> 1:00:46.689
But I can't seem to get
it together to leave.

1:00:46.722 --> 1:00:48.657
Okay, all right, calm down.

1:00:50.993 --> 1:00:53.029
Don't be so serious.

1:00:53.062 --> 1:00:53.929
It's no fun.

1:00:55.231 --> 1:00:56.433
Compartmentalize.

1:00:56.466 --> 1:00:58.100
My dad used to say,
he used to say,

1:00:58.134 --> 1:01:01.037
"Ignore the voices in your
head until you need them."

1:01:01.070 --> 1:01:02.071
All right, try that.

1:01:36.138 --> 1:01:36.972
Nope.

1:01:50.953 --> 1:01:53.322
Let me out of here!

1:01:54.424 --> 1:01:55.224
Please!

1:02:17.179 --> 1:02:18.247
I'm coming.

1:02:46.443 --> 1:02:47.276
Hello?

1:02:48.411 --> 1:02:50.012
Hey, hey!

1:02:50.045 --> 1:02:51.280
Are you okay?

1:02:51.313 --> 1:02:52.848
Oh my god,
is somebody there?

1:02:54.683 --> 1:02:56.886
- Can I help you?
- No!

1:02:56.919 --> 1:02:57.720
Help me!

1:02:59.088 --> 1:03:00.122
Please!

1:03:01.458 --> 1:03:03.593
I have to get out of here!

1:03:04.760 --> 1:03:05.595
Help me!

1:03:08.898 --> 1:03:12.067
He's trying to kill me,
he's trying to kill me!

1:03:12.101 --> 1:03:13.603
No, let her out!

1:03:13.637 --> 1:03:14.870
Let her out!

1:03:14.904 --> 1:03:18.340
You piece
of shit, let me out!

1:03:18.374 --> 1:03:19.476
Mrs. Inman!

1:03:21.478 --> 1:03:23.145
Mrs. Inman, who is in 15?

1:03:24.146 --> 1:03:25.281
Who is in 15?

1:03:35.090 --> 1:03:35.991
It's not possible.

1:03:41.330 --> 1:03:44.401
Tiny gaps in the paint,
water through the pipes,

1:03:44.434 --> 1:03:47.236
wood and concrete shifting
with the temperature.

1:03:48.538 --> 1:03:49.738
What you heard was eternity

1:03:49.772 --> 1:03:51.441
winding its way
through the walls.

1:03:52.542 --> 1:03:54.176
I didn't just hear crying.

1:03:56.912 --> 1:03:57.846
I saw her.

1:03:59.982 --> 1:04:01.717
She grabbed me.

1:04:03.919 --> 1:04:06.755
Well, it can
sound like crying.

1:04:29.613 --> 1:04:30.879
Just like that, huh?

1:04:48.330 --> 1:04:50.600
To whatever the
fuck is going on.

1:04:58.974 --> 1:05:00.175
- Mia.
- Number you have reached

1:05:00.209 --> 1:05:01.810
is not in service at this time.

1:05:03.647 --> 1:05:04.748
The number you
have reached is not

1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:06.315
- in service at this time.
- You called me.

1:05:06.348 --> 1:05:09.184
You called, you
fucking called me!

1:05:20.630 --> 1:05:22.965
Fuck, no, stop it!

1:05:32.174 --> 1:05:33.175
Marcy.

1:05:34.577 --> 1:05:36.713
What on earth is going on?

1:05:36.746 --> 1:05:38.782
What is going on,
Mrs. Inman, what?

1:05:38.814 --> 1:05:40.883
Look to your own self, Marcy.

1:05:42.318 --> 1:05:43.919
I think all your troubles
stem from your inability

1:05:43.952 --> 1:05:45.722
to see things as
they really are.

1:05:45.755 --> 1:05:46.790
As they really are?

1:05:48.023 --> 1:05:49.992
Nothing in this place is real!

1:05:50.025 --> 1:05:52.294
Oh, that's where
you're mistaken.

1:05:52.328 --> 1:05:53.697
And what are your mistakes?

1:05:54.597 --> 1:05:56.031
You should be examined.

1:05:58.033 --> 1:05:59.234
Was it an accident?

1:06:00.069 --> 1:06:01.904
Or did you muck it up?

1:06:10.747 --> 1:06:14.016
What the fuck did
you just say to me?

1:06:15.284 --> 1:06:16.885
Who told you to say that?

1:06:18.987 --> 1:06:21.558
How dare you, didn't
you shoot your husband?

1:06:21.591 --> 1:06:23.460
How can you judge me?

1:06:23.493 --> 1:06:24.561
I'm not your judge.

1:06:25.662 --> 1:06:26.895
And I'm doing penance for that,

1:06:26.929 --> 1:06:28.498
I'm working it off as we speak.

1:06:28.531 --> 1:06:30.633
What, what, what
are you talking about?

1:06:32.101 --> 1:06:35.672
Oh Marcy, I think you should
go up to your room right now.

1:06:38.140 --> 1:06:39.576
Is there a house phone here?

1:06:41.176 --> 1:06:42.010
Heavens no.

1:06:44.079 --> 1:06:47.015
I have so much to do, you're
not the only guest, you know.

1:06:47.049 --> 1:06:48.385
You know what?

1:07:13.008 --> 1:07:15.043
All right, you win.

1:08:03.860 --> 1:08:05.227
I guess that's for me, huh?

1:08:08.765 --> 1:08:09.599
Thank you.

1:11:07.175 --> 1:11:08.578
Please help me!

1:11:28.464 --> 1:11:32.535
Marcy?

1:11:32.568 --> 1:11:34.971
Look at me,
look at my, am I bleeding?

1:11:35.004 --> 1:11:37.507
No, no, no, no, nothing,
nothing, you're fine.

1:11:37.540 --> 1:11:38.541
You're fine.

1:11:39.942 --> 1:11:42.111
You're fine, okay?

1:11:44.179 --> 1:11:45.014
All right.

1:11:46.683 --> 1:11:48.651
You need to sit down, okay?

1:11:48.685 --> 1:11:49.752
Here, come in my room.

1:11:54.322 --> 1:11:55.124
Shit.

1:11:57.493 --> 1:11:59.095
Have a seat.

1:11:59.128 --> 1:11:59.929
Sit.

1:12:01.397 --> 1:12:02.197
You okay?

1:12:14.477 --> 1:12:15.310
Just one.

1:12:18.681 --> 1:12:19.515
You okay?

1:12:23.619 --> 1:12:24.921
What do you need?

1:12:24.954 --> 1:12:25.888
You need something?

1:12:27.390 --> 1:12:29.659
I know what you need, here.

1:12:34.397 --> 1:12:36.632
Take this.

1:12:36.666 --> 1:12:38.501
Take it.

1:12:38.534 --> 1:12:39.569
It'll ground you.

1:12:44.073 --> 1:12:44.907
That's right.

1:12:47.877 --> 1:12:48.711
There you go.

1:12:54.517 --> 1:12:56.652
Now tell me what happened.

1:12:57.954 --> 1:13:00.957
I had, okay.

1:13:00.990 --> 1:13:01.924
I was in the bath.

1:13:01.958 --> 1:13:03.025
You were in the bath.

1:13:03.059 --> 1:13:07.329
And I saw my
reflection in a mirror,

1:13:07.362 --> 1:13:09.799
and I was...

1:13:09.832 --> 1:13:14.437
I, I had bruises all,

1:13:16.105 --> 1:13:19.008
all over me, and I was bleeding.

1:13:19.041 --> 1:13:20.143
- Bleeding?
- I looked like...

1:13:20.176 --> 1:13:22.310
Okay, okay, just calm down.

1:13:23.345 --> 1:13:24.480
You were hallucinating.

1:13:25.681 --> 1:13:26.516
That's all.

1:13:27.784 --> 1:13:29.218
I mean, you were hitting
the bottle pretty hard.

1:13:29.252 --> 1:13:31.954
I saw you come upstairs
with a box of wine.

1:13:31.988 --> 1:13:33.156
You just drank too much.

1:13:33.189 --> 1:13:34.757
No, no, no, it's
not like that.

1:13:34.791 --> 1:13:37.894
I have had things that
are happening to me,

1:13:37.927 --> 1:13:39.695
it keeps happening to me,

1:13:39.729 --> 1:13:42.398
and I don't know
what's real anymore.

1:13:43.499 --> 1:13:44.500
Okay.

1:13:44.534 --> 1:13:46.702
It's okay.

1:13:46.736 --> 1:13:47.570
It's okay.

1:13:49.438 --> 1:13:50.305
You're okay.

1:13:52.675 --> 1:13:54.010
You just have to

1:13:57.980 --> 1:13:59.015
watch the brews.

1:14:02.718 --> 1:14:03.586
I try.

1:14:05.655 --> 1:14:06.823
I have tried.

1:14:06.856 --> 1:14:07.690
Uh huh.

1:14:09.559 --> 1:14:12.028
It's like there's a
different person inside me.

1:14:13.830 --> 1:14:15.231
She's relentless.

1:14:16.265 --> 1:14:17.533
She just wants to drink.

1:14:19.035 --> 1:14:20.269
I can't shut her up.

1:14:20.303 --> 1:14:23.472
Well, that's how it works.

1:14:26.075 --> 1:14:29.512
Maybe we all have two people

1:14:29.545 --> 1:14:31.280
walking around
inside of us, right?

1:14:33.316 --> 1:14:34.984
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:14:35.885 --> 1:14:37.153
She is person one?

1:14:37.186 --> 1:14:37.987
Sometimes.

1:14:40.256 --> 1:14:42.792
Sometimes it goes
the other way, too.

1:14:44.861 --> 1:14:45.695
Right?

1:14:50.199 --> 1:14:50.967
I should go.

1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.502
No, you should stay.

1:14:53.536 --> 1:14:54.737
You know, I was thinking,

1:14:54.770 --> 1:14:57.372
you know what you
were saying before?

1:14:58.307 --> 1:15:01.377
About, what did you say?

1:15:02.812 --> 1:15:05.781
Other self, how people have
two people inside of them?

1:15:06.749 --> 1:15:10.553
I think you can get rid of that.

1:15:10.586 --> 1:15:15.224
It just takes willpower, yeah.

1:15:15.258 --> 1:15:17.326
You know, mastery.

1:15:18.461 --> 1:15:20.429
I gotta tell you, I know
a lot about mastery.

1:15:25.902 --> 1:15:27.904
I don't wanna be alone.

1:15:30.940 --> 1:15:33.342
I don't wanna be alone,
because when I'm alone,

1:15:33.377 --> 1:15:36.612
I hear things, too,
inside my head.

1:15:40.449 --> 1:15:41.651
Do you hear the woman?

1:15:43.886 --> 1:15:45.288
The crying woman?

1:15:45.321 --> 1:15:47.391
Yeah, yeah, you hear her, too?

1:15:52.461 --> 1:15:54.363
I thought I was going
crazy, holy shit.

1:15:54.398 --> 1:15:56.499
- Yeah, she's real.
- No, no, she's not.

1:15:56.532 --> 1:15:59.568
I talked to Mrs. Inman, I
told her what was going on.

1:15:59.602 --> 1:16:01.570
She showed me the room,
it's fucking empty.

1:16:01.604 --> 1:16:03.306
Well, she's in another room.

1:16:03.339 --> 1:16:04.807
No.

1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:06.242
No, it's next door.

1:16:07.743 --> 1:16:08.711
But I heard her.

1:16:08.744 --> 1:16:11.381
I heard banging.

1:16:11.415 --> 1:16:13.115
She was banging.

1:16:14.216 --> 1:16:15.451
- Wait, what?
- Bang, bang, bang!

1:16:15.484 --> 1:16:17.687
You know, she was, I
heard her, you know?

1:16:17.720 --> 1:16:21.891
Not here, but before, and
I didn't hear her at first.

1:16:21.924 --> 1:16:26.195
But she was banging, and
then she was screaming.

1:16:26.228 --> 1:16:29.298
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:16:29.332 --> 1:16:33.035
Something happened
and I can't remember.

1:16:33.069 --> 1:16:34.837
And I don't wanna be alone.

1:16:34.870 --> 1:16:37.039
I just, it always
happens when I'm alone.

1:16:37.073 --> 1:16:40.643
I hear the sounds only
when I'm alone, like you.

1:16:43.612 --> 1:16:45.481
You only hear it when
you're alone, right?

1:16:47.451 --> 1:16:48.617
That makes us the same.

1:16:51.854 --> 1:16:52.688
We're the same.

1:16:55.057 --> 1:16:59.695
So please don't go.

1:16:59.729 --> 1:17:02.231
Will you, will you stay?

1:17:05.868 --> 1:17:10.139
Yeah, will you stay?

1:17:10.172 --> 1:17:11.007
Yeah.

1:17:59.722 --> 1:18:01.357
I'm glad you stayed.

1:18:21.844 --> 1:18:23.179
Glad you stayed.

1:18:24.046 --> 1:18:25.214
Mm-hm, say it.

1:18:26.383 --> 1:18:27.817
I'm glad you stayed.

1:18:27.850 --> 1:18:32.855
Yeah, I'm glad I stayed.

1:18:43.666 --> 1:18:45.101
What, what?

1:18:46.135 --> 1:18:46.936
Don't!

1:18:48.637 --> 1:18:49.905
Get off.

1:18:49.939 --> 1:18:51.140
Get off!

1:18:51.173 --> 1:18:52.842
Get off, stop!

1:18:55.744 --> 1:18:57.680
Don't, don't, don't!

1:18:57.713 --> 1:18:59.815
Please stop, Owen!

1:18:59.849 --> 1:19:01.183
Owen!

1:19:13.229 --> 1:19:14.864
Marcy!

1:19:14.897 --> 1:19:16.932
Marcy, talk to me!

1:19:17.867 --> 1:19:19.935
Please come back, huh?

1:19:19.969 --> 1:19:21.237
Leave me alone!

1:19:21.270 --> 1:19:23.607
What are you
doing in there, huh?

1:19:23.639 --> 1:19:25.307
Don't you fucking
call her, okay?

1:19:26.142 --> 1:19:26.976
Please?

1:19:28.144 --> 1:19:29.044
What, what are
you talking about?

1:19:29.078 --> 1:19:30.547
That bitch Inman, look,

1:19:30.580 --> 1:19:32.616
just leave that fucking
bitch out of this, please.

1:19:32.648 --> 1:19:33.949
Why would you call her that?

1:19:33.983 --> 1:19:35.718
Because
she fucking pries!

1:19:35.751 --> 1:19:38.721
She presses, she tries to
get in my fucking head,

1:19:38.754 --> 1:19:41.257
she's making me go
fucking crazy, Marcy!

1:19:42.925 --> 1:19:44.461
Hey.

1:19:44.494 --> 1:19:47.663
Hey Marcy, why don't you
come back to my room, huh?

1:19:47.696 --> 1:19:50.332
I'm working on this experiment,

1:19:50.366 --> 1:19:55.371
and I'm finding my true self.

1:19:56.238 --> 1:19:57.940
You know, and I need your help.

1:20:00.843 --> 1:20:02.011
Please?

1:20:02.044 --> 1:20:04.346
What kind of experiment?

1:20:11.421 --> 1:20:13.490
I wanna see how long
I can last with a woman

1:20:13.523 --> 1:20:14.524
without killing her.

1:20:20.029 --> 1:20:20.930
Don't cry.

1:20:24.133 --> 1:20:26.135
Marcy, open the fucking door!

1:20:26.168 --> 1:20:27.036
Open it!

1:20:28.405 --> 1:20:30.806
Look, I didn't even fucking
kill you, did I, huh?

1:20:30.839 --> 1:20:33.443
I didn't even fucking kill
this bitch that's in the trunk!

1:20:33.476 --> 1:20:36.345
Okay, she's still alive,
she's still breathing, right?

1:20:36.379 --> 1:20:37.813
911,
what's your emergency?

1:20:37.846 --> 1:20:39.782
Hi, hi, there's somebody
trying to break into my room,

1:20:39.815 --> 1:20:40.749
can you please come?

1:20:40.783 --> 1:20:42.818
It's a man, he's dangerous.

1:20:43.719 --> 1:20:45.054
Fuck you.

1:20:45.087 --> 1:20:47.189
What
is your emergency?

1:20:47.223 --> 1:20:48.458
I just told you,
there's somebody trying

1:20:48.491 --> 1:20:49.725
to break into my room.

1:20:49.758 --> 1:20:51.494
He has a history,
he's a criminal.

1:20:51.528 --> 1:20:52.728
Is
this an emergency

1:20:52.761 --> 1:20:54.631
or a problem that you've
caused for yourself?

1:20:56.499 --> 1:20:57.299
What?

1:20:59.101 --> 1:21:00.135
So much of
what's happened to you

1:21:00.169 --> 1:21:01.737
was preventable, Marcy.

1:21:04.206 --> 1:21:05.007
Who is this?

1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:06.610
Harvey, for instance.

1:21:06.643 --> 1:21:09.646
Threatened you and your
office the day you fired him.

1:21:09.679 --> 1:21:12.047
He said he thought about
coming back with a gun

1:21:12.081 --> 1:21:14.250
and showing you
what was important.

1:21:14.283 --> 1:21:15.452
He told you that.

1:21:16.852 --> 1:21:19.121
I didn't know that that's
what he was going to do.

1:21:19.154 --> 1:21:21.424
You
were drunk, though.

1:21:21.458 --> 1:21:23.959
You started the fire,
you ran away from that.

1:21:25.361 --> 1:21:27.796
Okay, I don't wanna
talk about that right now.

1:21:27.830 --> 1:21:31.000
You were
drunk, you started the fire,

1:21:31.033 --> 1:21:31.900
you ran away.

1:21:33.269 --> 1:21:35.572
I must have kicked a candle
over when I was asleep.

1:21:35.605 --> 1:21:38.408
It's an accident, these
things happen to everybody.

1:21:40.943 --> 1:21:42.044
And the shooting?

1:21:42.077 --> 1:21:43.245
Was that an accident?

1:21:43.279 --> 1:21:44.313
And the car wreck?

1:21:46.416 --> 1:21:48.117
Could that have been prevented?

1:21:48.150 --> 1:21:49.018
Stop it!

1:21:50.553 --> 1:21:52.187
You've been
irresponsible and negligent,

1:21:52.221 --> 1:21:54.424
and it's led to great disaster.

1:21:54.457 --> 1:21:55.891
It's broken my heart.

1:21:58.728 --> 1:21:59.529
Mia?

1:22:00.996 --> 1:22:02.532
It's time
to face yourself.

1:22:03.866 --> 1:22:05.702
The mirror is a
window to the soul.

1:22:08.203 --> 1:22:10.105
That's not how
that saying goes.

1:22:14.076 --> 1:22:16.479
Mia...

1:22:38.334 --> 1:22:42.004
You were a
godless child, just like me.

1:22:43.339 --> 1:22:46.041
And you shall celebrate
with the bounty

1:22:46.075 --> 1:22:47.444
your father gave you.

1:22:48.645 --> 1:22:49.813
That's Deuteronomy.

1:23:12.402 --> 1:23:14.069
You can't stop me.

1:25:28.905 --> 1:25:30.840
Hey!

1:25:48.625 --> 1:25:51.260
Let me out of here!

1:25:59.268 --> 1:26:01.404
I don't know what to do.

1:26:02.539 --> 1:26:03.740
You will keep coming back

1:26:03.773 --> 1:26:05.708
until you assume your
culpability, Marcy.

1:26:48.451 --> 1:26:51.387
I left my house
and I got in the car.

1:26:53.990 --> 1:26:57.760
Drunk, I'm always drunk.

1:26:59.729 --> 1:27:00.863
And I went to work.

1:27:05.735 --> 1:27:06.569
Harvey.

1:27:08.236 --> 1:27:09.072
Harvey.

1:27:11.874 --> 1:27:12.709
I knew it.

1:27:16.713 --> 1:27:18.113
All those people.

1:27:25.287 --> 1:27:26.789
Mia.

1:27:29.257 --> 1:27:30.093
Oh my god.

1:27:31.995 --> 1:27:33.496
Mia, I'm so sorry.

1:27:37.533 --> 1:27:38.468
And Dad, too.

1:27:43.539 --> 1:27:44.774
They were all my fault.

1:27:46.376 --> 1:27:48.444
All of them, all of it.

1:27:48.478 --> 1:27:49.479
It's all me.

1:27:52.347 --> 1:27:55.183
And you, you were
in the other car.

1:27:55.217 --> 1:27:57.352
You were driving the other car.

1:27:57.387 --> 1:27:59.489
With a guest in his trunk.

1:28:00.890 --> 1:28:03.860
It was the one life you saved,
Marcy, your one good deed.

1:28:05.528 --> 1:28:06.729
The crying woman.

1:28:18.708 --> 1:28:20.308
Hell couldn't wait any longer.

1:28:23.211 --> 1:28:24.380
Are you ready?

1:28:29.819 --> 1:28:30.820
I'm ready.

1:29:13.463 --> 1:29:14.296
Mia.

1:30:17.325 --> 1:30:19.228
Welcome.
