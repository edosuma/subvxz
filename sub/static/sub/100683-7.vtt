WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.504
WOMAN: I was pregnant,
and I was scared.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.341
(coughs, exhales)

00:09.110 --> 00:11.379
This is
my deathbed confession.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.325
We have just returned
from the talkies.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.660
They should never have
added sound.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.263
There was pop music and people
talking all the way through it.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.998
We had to watch it like this.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.001
I mean, it was better, but I had
no idea what was going on.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.704
-I like to read when
I'm watching the pictures.
-(eerie whispering)

00:36.737 --> 00:39.673
-And then I can...
-(echoing): Laszlo.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.409
-Hello?
-Hello.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.911
Do you hear this? There is
a voice coming from the sewer.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.179
Laszlo.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.847
LASZLO:
"Laszlo." It's saying my name.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.382
You won't be able to hear that
'cause you don't have

00:48.416 --> 00:50.584
the finely attuned ears
that we do.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.953
Excuse me, good evening.
Are you in the sewer?

00:52.986 --> 00:54.188
Yes.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.289
-Yes, it says.
-Oh.

00:55.323 --> 00:59.093
Come into the sewer.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.694
-In the sewer?
-Yes, yes.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.696
I don't think so, me old boy.

01:02.730 --> 01:06.100
Come. Please.

01:06.134 --> 01:07.568
We're in a sewer.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.238
Quite why we're in a sewer,
I've no idea.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.240
Because we've been
invited here, darling.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.108
What, to walk through
a shit pipe? Please.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.610
-(rapid footsteps)
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.512
What in hell's house was that?

01:20.114 --> 01:22.316
Show yourself.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.385
-NADJA: Hello?
-LASZLO: Be you vampire?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.986
Rude.

01:26.019 --> 01:28.789
-(single piano note repeating)
-What was that?

01:28.822 --> 01:32.560
NADJA:
Huh? Hello? Excuse me.

01:32.593 --> 01:36.497
We mean no harm, we're just
w-walking in your shit pipe.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.332
Don't worry, my darling,
I shall protect you.

01:38.366 --> 01:40.134
You're just pushing me
in front of you.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.336
-I know what I'm doing.
-What, putting me in front

01:42.370 --> 01:44.872
-to get the danger first?
-Who is that?

01:46.307 --> 01:49.243
LASZLO:
You're kidding.
Simon the fucking Devious.

01:49.277 --> 01:52.079
Yes. It's me.
(chuckles)

01:52.112 --> 01:53.447
I was never in any doubt.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.516
You just said you didn't know
who it was.

01:55.549 --> 01:58.852
("You're Dead"
by Norma Tanega playing)

01:58.886 --> 02:01.355
* Don't sing if you want
to live long *

02:01.389 --> 02:03.924
* They have no use
for your song *

02:03.957 --> 02:06.527
* You're dead, you're dead,
you're dead *

02:06.560 --> 02:08.962
* You're dead
and out of this world *

02:11.031 --> 02:14.034
* Now your hope and compassion
is gone *

02:14.067 --> 02:16.837
* You sold out your dream
to the world *

02:16.870 --> 02:19.139
* Stay dead, stay dead,
stay dead *

02:19.173 --> 02:21.842
* You're dead
and out of this world. *

02:31.252 --> 02:35.155
COLIN: One of the best ways
to drain people's energy

02:35.189 --> 02:38.025
nowadays is via the Internet.

02:38.058 --> 02:41.061
This woman is a astrophysicist.

02:41.094 --> 02:45.699
"Actually, this is not
how space works.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.801
Read a book."

02:47.835 --> 02:49.370
Now I just wait

02:49.403 --> 02:51.572
-for the comments to come in.
-(computer chimes)

02:51.605 --> 02:54.542
"Hey, can you mansplain
any louder?"

02:54.575 --> 02:56.176
Yeah, sure.

02:56.210 --> 03:00.013
These are all different accounts
that I have set up.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.516
The energy you get this way
isn't quite as pure,

03:02.550 --> 03:05.386
but if you do enough of it,
it'll fill you up.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.821
"Shanghai sucked.

03:07.855 --> 03:11.091
Where was the Chinatown?"

03:11.124 --> 03:14.895
"Jason Mraz is just
too weird for me."

03:14.928 --> 03:18.198
"Jesus actually hates horses."

03:18.232 --> 03:22.270
"Childhood obesity? LMFO."

03:22.303 --> 03:24.772
When they call you a dumbass,
you know you've got them.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.241
-(computer chimes)
-They called me a dumbass.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.344
"Women are getting too tall."

03:30.378 --> 03:33.947
-(computers chiming)
-You can drain their energy
via social media

03:33.981 --> 03:36.384
without having to even
be near them.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.051
"That is racist."

03:38.085 --> 03:40.087
(chuckles):
You are correct, it is.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.289
-(computer chiming)
-Oh, yeah.

03:41.322 --> 03:44.024
Yeah, yeah. Oh, they hate me.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.427
It's surprisingly simple
to get total strangers

03:46.460 --> 03:48.296
completely furious with you.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.398
-(computer chimes)
-"I should get a life."

03:50.431 --> 03:52.065
(computer chimes)

03:52.099 --> 03:54.067
-Come, come, come in.
-(piano playing)

03:54.101 --> 03:56.370
It's a beautiful song, isn't it?

03:56.404 --> 03:57.571
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, great.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.373
-Um...
-We got to go.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.475
Y-You remember, uh,
Count Rapula,

04:01.509 --> 04:03.644
-from my crew?
-(groans)

04:03.677 --> 04:05.379
-* Sewer dwelling... *
-Oh, God.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.581
* Deeper than hell,
and subterranean *

04:07.615 --> 04:09.216
* Hotter than uranium *

04:09.249 --> 04:11.385
* Playing 'em
from the cranium. *

04:11.419 --> 04:13.587
Yes, "straight from the
cranium." How does he do it?

04:13.621 --> 04:17.591
I think he pre-writes the raps
and pretends they're freestyled.

04:17.625 --> 04:18.992
And Carol.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.062
Uh, where is my dear Carol?
Is she here?

04:22.095 --> 04:24.064
-(gasps)
-LASZLO: Good heavens.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.400
Ah, there she is.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.769
A vision, isn't she?

04:28.802 --> 04:32.740
And that is, well, about
the extent of the crew now.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.842
Most of them left after...

04:34.875 --> 04:39.413
Are you aware that...
my nightclub exploded?

04:39.447 --> 04:40.581
Um...

04:40.614 --> 04:42.416
-Touch the sky!
-Touch the sky.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.151
-Shit!
-Shit!

04:44.184 --> 04:46.186
I think my hat's
probably cursed.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.355
No.

04:47.388 --> 04:51.325
Yes, well, it exploded
and I lost my home.

04:51.359 --> 04:55.363
I was found in the wreckage
by the ambulance people.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.698
Is that you in there, Simon?
Well, I'm gonna take

04:57.731 --> 04:59.533
my hat back,
you crispy piece of shit.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.671
-Just going to turn this off.
-(piano stops)

05:03.704 --> 05:07.508
I don't know how to play
the piano, so I use a Zune.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.378
How did I survive, you ask?

05:10.411 --> 05:12.045
LASZLO:
I didn't ask.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.313
No one asked.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.215
I used what little
strength I had

05:15.248 --> 05:20.187
and wandered the sewers
of New York City,

05:20.220 --> 05:22.390
eventually connecting
with Carol...

05:22.423 --> 05:24.658
-(hisses)
-...who's been great.

05:24.692 --> 05:28.729
And then I found Rapula by
sending him psychic messages.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.665
-Uh, you e-mailed me.
-And I e-mailed him as well.

05:31.699 --> 05:35.168
And now it is to my great shame

05:35.202 --> 05:38.238
that you find me here...

05:38.271 --> 05:40.207
-In the sewer.
-...in Staten Island.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.210
But what matters
is that you are here.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.878
Yeah, listen,
this has been fantastic.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.346
-Oh, yeah.
-It's been great seeing you.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.748
You should come at anytime.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.216
Nandor would love
to see all of you.

05:49.249 --> 05:52.252
Disgusting. Why did you
invite the prick?

05:52.285 --> 05:55.222
I felt sorry for the wretched
creature. His home is a sewer!

05:55.255 --> 05:57.725
He's not gonna come here.
He'll be too embarrassed.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.359
He has some dignity, at least.

05:59.393 --> 06:02.362
SIMON:
Well, well, well.
We beat you here.

06:02.396 --> 06:05.866
We have visitors,
so that's a nice surprise.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.768
We took the sewers, of course.
It's a straight shot

06:07.801 --> 06:08.869
from our place.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.872
Now we are here
in your lovely home.

06:11.905 --> 06:15.509
-(hisses)
-Carol. It is lovely.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.344
These are our hosts. Be nice.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.080
And to reiterate, do not eat.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.349
-If possible.
-(hisses)
-How do you resist?

06:22.382 --> 06:24.952
Well, it used to be difficult
to resist,

06:24.985 --> 06:27.087
but after a while,
you start to wonder

06:27.120 --> 06:29.022
why hasn't anyone eaten him?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.892
He's like the last doughnut
in the display cabinet.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.627
-(crunching)
-Carol. Carol!

06:33.661 --> 06:35.228
Do not eat. Something wrong.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.264
-(hisses)
-Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.566
-(hissing)
-NANDOR: You want
to show Carol your room?

06:38.599 --> 06:40.801
No. I don't think
she'd like that.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.471
-Would you like to see
Guillermo's room?
-(hissing)

06:43.504 --> 06:45.473
She's going to eat him
if she goes to the room.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.107
Okay, probably better not.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.281
LASZLO:
We keep spare coffins
down here.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.583
There might be something,
if you're lucky.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.817
Come this way.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.152
SIMON:
Oh, that would be so kind.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.554
-Ah.
-Oh.

07:00.588 --> 07:01.755
-(guitar strumming)
-Hello, Elvis.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.957
* Mm... *

07:03.991 --> 07:05.726
-Hey.
-I made him into a vampire

07:05.759 --> 07:07.795
back in the 1970s.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.429
He sometimes uses this room,

07:09.463 --> 07:10.964
which you can see,
he's doing some recording.

07:10.998 --> 07:14.067
-So it's probably best if we...
-Hello, The King.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.435
Yeah, yes.
Back up the stairs.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.404
-Sorry, Elvis.
-It's all right.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.240
* Drinking that
big ol' blood, baby. *

07:20.273 --> 07:21.909
SIMON:
Really, we'll sleep anywhere.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.911
In the rafters. I could
construct a makeshift coffin

07:23.944 --> 07:25.746
out of discarded planks.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.816
Uh, honestly, you are just
such a true friend.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.450
(groans)

07:30.484 --> 07:33.320
It is very sad to see Simon
so decrepit and weak.

07:33.353 --> 07:34.522
No, it's not.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.123
It's about time he ate shit.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.591
It's partially our fault.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.927
Because of your bloody
cursed, stupid hat.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.128
It's ruined him.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.363
That thing makes men go crazy.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.832
Well, we needn't worry
about that anymore.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.033
We don't know where the hat is.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.701
-Right?
-Well, exactly. Exactly.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.037
The hat is gone, so we
don't need to worry about it.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.639
-Thank goodness.
-Yep.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.808
There's some kind of human nerd

07:54.842 --> 07:57.277
who is telling people
to ignore me.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.514
I mean, he's getting my accounts
suspended left and right.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.516
This will not stand.

08:02.550 --> 08:05.318
I mean,
he's stealing my food now.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.387
-(computer chimes)
-He just told people

08:07.420 --> 08:10.290
that I live
in my mother's basement.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.693
"Actually, I live

08:12.726 --> 08:16.463
in my own basement, dumbass."

08:16.496 --> 08:18.899
Fire.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.870
Oh, no. H-He's getting to me.

08:22.903 --> 08:26.707
Simon the Devious, he thinks
I don't know what he's up to,

08:26.740 --> 08:28.375
but I do.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.010
There he goes.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.244
Follow me.
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.714
Look. Running away.

08:33.747 --> 08:36.083
Ah... He's only here
to steal my hat.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.751
I got you.

08:37.785 --> 08:40.353
(shushes)
He's gone into the cellar.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.557
We need to catch him in the act.

08:43.591 --> 08:44.892
There you are!

08:44.925 --> 08:47.094
-The game's up, old chum.
-Oh...

08:47.127 --> 08:49.396
Nothing's changed
since New York City.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.865
-I don't know what
you're talking about...
-Really, you smug bastard?

08:51.899 --> 08:53.266
What's behind your back?

08:53.300 --> 08:54.501
Just the rope, I think.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.904
Show me.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.338
Yeah.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.506
-Get in the hall.
-Laszlo, I...

08:59.539 --> 09:01.575
-What's going on?
-Everyone come down.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.076
Th-There's been
a misunderstanding.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.212
-What is it? What is it?
-LASZLO: This.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.681
-This thief.
-Thief? Chop his hands off.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.516
Don't embarrass him.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.719
Laszlo, my love.
He's not gonna get me.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.387
I'm yours, baby. Chill out.

09:14.421 --> 09:17.424
-I'm yours forever.
-Uncover that now.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.192
I-I'd really prefer
not to, if possible.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.527
Yeah, I bet you wouldn't.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.595
-Well, look at that.
-(grunts)

09:21.629 --> 09:23.731
Oh.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.232
Lovely. Very...

09:25.265 --> 09:26.800
Very cool.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.035
-NADJA: Gorgeous.
-LASZLO: What the fuck is it?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.369
NANDOR:
Yes, what is it?

09:29.402 --> 09:30.771
It's a bat.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.140
I made it myself
from sewer trash.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.442
It's just a small gift
to say thank you

09:35.475 --> 09:38.545
for allowing me and my reduced
crew to stay with you.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.414
I just wanted to say thank you
for not abandoning me

09:41.448 --> 09:43.416
-when everyone else had.
-Oh.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.118
Simon, you don't
need to say any more.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.655
That is so pathetic
and truly lovely.

09:47.688 --> 09:48.922
Thank you.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.424
(quietly):
Well, I'm sorry.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.425
What was that?

09:52.459 --> 09:53.761
I said I'm sorry.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.062
Couldn't quite hear that.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.396
NADJA:
No, I couldn't hear it, either.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.231
I said I'm sorry.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.232
NANDOR:
Well, the good news is

09:59.266 --> 10:00.934
you get to keep your hands.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.406
GUILLERMO:
Everyone's asleep, so...

10:06.439 --> 10:09.009
you know, I get a little bit
of peace and quiet--

10:09.042 --> 10:11.244
Chinga!
(exhaling)

10:11.278 --> 10:13.613
(hissing)

10:13.647 --> 10:16.449
She startled me.
(chuckles)

10:16.483 --> 10:18.986
(shouts)
Mierda!

10:19.019 --> 10:20.954
Hey, Carol.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.791
I know what you are.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.527
Hopefully not lunch.
(laughs)

10:27.560 --> 10:29.162
(mouths)

10:29.196 --> 10:30.463
Master?

10:30.497 --> 10:32.432
You are a slayer.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.934
(quietly):
What? Why did you say that?

10:33.967 --> 10:35.335
I-- No.

10:35.368 --> 10:38.605
I smell the death on you.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.842
Oh, that, that's just
my body spray. It's Axe.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.977
Killer of vampires.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.178
(whispering):
Carol, stop saying that, okay?

10:45.212 --> 10:46.814
I'm gonna be a vampire
just like you.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.048
-(hisses)
-(screams)

10:50.984 --> 10:52.820
COLIN:
Sounded like

10:52.853 --> 10:55.388
Guillermo just took
a tumble down the steps.

10:55.422 --> 10:58.391
-Maybe I should, uh...
-(computer chimes)

10:58.425 --> 11:00.894
F... Asshole.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.864
"If my dick is a pencil,

11:03.897 --> 11:07.701
then why am I using
a keyboard to write?"

11:07.735 --> 11:08.969
Fire.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.639
(hissing)

11:12.672 --> 11:15.242
Oh, wow. You're really strong.
(whimpers)

11:15.275 --> 11:17.110
I'm really impressed.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.715
Slayer.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.951
Don't call me that.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.255
(shouting)

11:31.258 --> 11:32.926
Slayer.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.662
(screams)

11:35.695 --> 11:37.097
Slayer...

11:37.130 --> 11:38.932
(shushes)

11:38.966 --> 11:40.200
(grunts)

11:43.270 --> 11:44.905
(wails)

11:46.774 --> 11:48.108
I don't feel good about that.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.443
Something bad's gonna happen,
isn't it?

11:50.477 --> 11:51.678
(shrieks)

11:51.711 --> 11:53.213
It's just me, Guillermo.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.714
Hello, sir.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.349
I heard a horrible
feminine shrieking.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.219
-Were you having a nightmare?
-You could say that.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.555
Uh-- Guillermo, why is there
all this dust on the floor

12:02.589 --> 12:04.591
in the shape of a body?

12:04.624 --> 12:07.460
Were you trying to make
a girlfriend out of dust?

12:07.494 --> 12:10.463
-No, the vacuum broke and...
-It is a very messy
but cool idea.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.432
Reminds me of Carol.

12:12.465 --> 12:17.204
You know, how she's kind of like
that shape and that smell...

12:17.237 --> 12:19.639
Guillermo?

12:19.672 --> 12:21.875
Did you kill Carol?

12:21.909 --> 12:24.878
(crying): It was an accident.
I'm sorry, sir.

12:24.912 --> 12:28.281
Oh, no. You killed a vampire.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.651
That's very frowned upon
amongst the vampire community.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.153
-Is it?
-Yes.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.387
Simon's not going
to like the fact

12:34.421 --> 12:35.889
that you've killed
one of his crew.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.558
-He's only got a little crew.
-I know. I know.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.928
You must not say anything about
this to anyone, understand?

12:40.961 --> 12:43.296
-I won't.
-Because it reflects
badly on me,

12:43.330 --> 12:45.799
-and you will be killed.
-Okay, then I definitely won't.

12:45.833 --> 12:49.302
All right... vampire killer.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.670
(sobs)

12:50.703 --> 12:52.139
Only joking. Clean it up.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.606
You got it, sir.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.630
(sneezes, coughing)

13:19.199 --> 13:21.368
I searched his name,
I didn't get much.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.136
(grunts)

13:23.170 --> 13:26.339
But I found his eBay profile.
He used his actual e-mail.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.441
Hacked that
and I found some photos.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.777
One of which had
a Pennsylvania watermark.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.779
So I traced that back
to another account.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.481
Found his actual location,

13:34.514 --> 13:38.218
an Internet café
in Medford, Massachusetts.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.619
Rookie mistake.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.654
Also, he did DM me,

13:41.688 --> 13:44.157
saying he wanted to kick my ass
and gave me his address.

13:44.191 --> 13:47.127
So another rookie mistake.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.828
Waiting on my driver now.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.130
-Hello.
-Hey.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.731
Mind if I sit up front?

13:51.764 --> 13:53.533
And that's why you have
to be careful on the Internet.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.503
There's creeps out there
that'll find out where you live.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.039
I mean, you really need
to encrypt everything.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.041
Okay, I'm gonna speed up.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.642
SIMON:
House meeting.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.511
-To the foyer. House meeting.
-House meeting?

14:04.544 --> 14:06.546
LASZLO:
The fuck does he think he is?

14:06.579 --> 14:08.315
-NADJA: No, it's night.
-It's not his house.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.418
Ah, yes, thank you all
for coming to the house meeting.

14:11.451 --> 14:15.355
I wanted to say thank you,
for staying here has replenished

14:15.388 --> 14:18.158
my heart and my soul
and my body.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.594
And I am forever grateful to all
of you for your hospitality.

14:21.628 --> 14:25.565
But onto some more
difficult news.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.036
Carol has gone missing.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.005
She seems to have slipped away
in the dead of night,

14:32.039 --> 14:33.840
abandoning me...

14:33.873 --> 14:36.043
-NADJA: Oh, no.
-...like so many others have.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.544
Guillermo?

14:37.577 --> 14:40.513
-Hmm?
-You seem relieved.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.714
GUILLERMO:
Hmm?

14:41.748 --> 14:45.485
I think I know
why you are relieved.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.754
Why?

14:47.787 --> 14:50.757
Because Carol...

14:50.790 --> 14:53.260
wanted to eat you.
(laughs)

14:53.293 --> 14:56.063
(chuckles)
That's so flattering.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.631
She really did not like you.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.400
I don't know why.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.370
Probably because
he's such a downer.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.637
-Indeed.
-GUILLERMO: Yeah, that's true.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.974
Yes, I noticed that.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.709
I just have one...

15:09.742 --> 15:11.544
one final question.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.579
NANDOR:
Yes?

15:12.612 --> 15:15.615
Where is the hat?

15:15.648 --> 15:17.250
I bloody knew it.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.485
I want that hat!

15:18.518 --> 15:19.919
Which hat?

15:19.953 --> 15:23.090
-This hat?
-Yes. Give me the hat!

15:23.123 --> 15:24.958
-No chance, Simon.
-You gave it to me as a gift.

15:24.992 --> 15:29.496
You took it by force
from me in New York City.

15:29.529 --> 15:33.766
Yes, and it looked better
on me in New York City.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.602
And it will be mine!

15:35.635 --> 15:37.770
(laughs, groans)

15:37.804 --> 15:41.108
I could've sworn
that I left that door open.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.643
Devious!

15:43.676 --> 15:46.513
Meet thy maker!

15:46.546 --> 15:47.847
Ha!

15:47.880 --> 15:51.184
I caught your arrow with ease.

15:51.218 --> 15:53.620
(laughs)
Ooh!

15:53.653 --> 15:55.989
I caught it inside my hand.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.691
-Do you need a bandage?
-No, it's the fucking hat.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.094
-(wailing)
-I'll be taking this!

16:01.128 --> 16:02.629
SIMON:
I want that hat! I want to feel

16:02.662 --> 16:05.265
the sweet embrace of a witch's
sphincter against my...

16:05.298 --> 16:06.933
-NADJA: Idiot.
-LASZLO: Where are you, Simon?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.501
This isn't about the hat.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.371
-It's about... (shouts)
-(horn honking)

16:11.404 --> 16:12.972
-Ooh! Ow.
-(horns blaring)

16:13.006 --> 16:14.107
(shouts)

16:14.141 --> 16:15.808
NADJA:
You kept the hat!

16:15.842 --> 16:16.843
You bloody plonker!

16:16.876 --> 16:18.645
-Fuck me.
-And now look at you,

16:18.678 --> 16:20.880
bouncing off the cars
like a bouncing idiot.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.616
-LASZLO: Fucking hell!
-Is he gonna be all right?

16:23.650 --> 16:24.951
(grunts)

16:24.984 --> 16:26.053
-Shit.
-NANDOR: There.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.688
-Bat!
-(bats squeaking)

16:28.721 --> 16:30.657
Once again, into the shit pipe.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.993
I saw that he logged into
the café computer after hours.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.862
I think he lives here.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.697
What am I doing?

16:37.730 --> 16:40.467
I mean, I-I'm stalking
some poor schmuck

16:40.500 --> 16:42.669
whose only outlet
is his computer?

16:42.702 --> 16:43.970
Nah, this is stupid.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.538
It's gone too far.
(chuckles)

16:45.572 --> 16:46.873
(phone vibrates)

16:48.175 --> 16:50.843
Uh, he-he messaged me.

16:50.877 --> 16:53.746
"Colin Robinson,
I know you are here.

16:53.780 --> 16:58.418
Meet me in the alleyway,
you loser."

17:00.087 --> 17:01.854
I'm gonna teach
this little beef jerky

17:01.888 --> 17:03.256
a thing or two about boredom.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.158
Stupid little
jerk-chicken human.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.359
This troll.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.595
(heavy footsteps approaching)

17:08.628 --> 17:09.862
Oh.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.668
(neck cracks)

17:15.702 --> 17:19.072
You don't look like
your online photo.

17:19.106 --> 17:21.708
(growling)

17:21.741 --> 17:24.544
(high-pitched babbling)

17:24.577 --> 17:27.380
Shh. I'm echolocating. Shh!

17:27.414 --> 17:29.582
(high-pitched babbling)

17:29.616 --> 17:31.951
-(bats screeching)
-(Guillermo whimpering)

17:31.984 --> 17:34.721
NADJA:
Laszlo, stop it!

17:34.754 --> 17:36.689
-Go, go.
-Laszlo?

17:36.723 --> 17:39.626
You've been annoying me,
Colin Robinson.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.628
Yeah, well, you've been troll...

17:41.661 --> 17:44.131
-trolling me.
-Excuse me, I'm a troll.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.798
I do not like
the term "trolling."

17:45.832 --> 17:48.468
Well, it's not really up
for you to decide.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.537
-I mean, that's current slang.
-Well, I think it is

17:50.570 --> 17:51.738
because I am a troll.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.273
It's an offensive term.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.108
Well, that's
what it means, so...

17:55.142 --> 17:57.144
-That's not what it means.
-It does mean that.

17:57.177 --> 18:00.313
If you need me to look it up in
Webster's and show you, I will.

18:00.347 --> 18:03.316
-You're basically just a big...
-Don't say it.

18:03.350 --> 18:06.119
My being a troll is not related
to my online trolling.

18:06.153 --> 18:09.622
I-I'm sorry that people use
the term "trolling."

18:09.656 --> 18:11.324
-Don't use the word.
-But when you're a troll

18:11.358 --> 18:13.560
-and you troll,
then you're trolling.
-If you say it, I'll hit you.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.229
-(bats squeaking)
-It's a bat battle.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.765
-It's a hat battle.
-(beatboxing)

18:18.798 --> 18:20.767
* Hey, yo, battly, battly,
flappity flap bat... *

18:20.800 --> 18:23.570
R-Rapula, no, no.
"Flappity flap"?

18:23.603 --> 18:26.306
Human form!
(shouts)

18:26.339 --> 18:28.608
(yells)

18:28.641 --> 18:30.243
Bat!

18:30.277 --> 18:32.111
(shouting)

18:32.145 --> 18:34.113
LASZLO:
This doesn't hurt.
Not bothered by it.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.250
-Yeah! Simon the bat!
-Bat!

18:37.284 --> 18:38.851
NANDOR:
Go, Laszlo!

18:38.885 --> 18:40.820
-Which one's Laszlo?
-I don't know. Go, Laszlo!

18:47.527 --> 18:49.196
-Human form.
-(grunts) Ooh, boy.

18:49.229 --> 18:52.765
-My arms are tired. (chuckles)
-You can't win, Devious.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.834
It is you who
is outnumbered this time.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.003
Oh, am I?
(laughs)

18:57.036 --> 18:59.038
-(bats squeaking)
-Oh, shit.

18:59.071 --> 19:00.773
You remember my crew, don't you?

19:00.807 --> 19:02.041
There's Gunthrapal,

19:02.074 --> 19:04.677
Klaglad the Exsanguinator

19:04.711 --> 19:07.046
and of course, Wesley Sykes.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.648
NADJA:
You lying piece of asshole!

19:08.681 --> 19:12.118
Impusa, the Freak sisters,

19:12.151 --> 19:15.822
Ken-- the zombie of
my former accountant.

19:15.855 --> 19:20.393
Some of our newer members,
Neil, Patrick and Harris.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.861
You son of a bastard!

19:21.894 --> 19:23.963
He's planned the whole thing,
look at him.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.164
And Elvis.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.133
-(gasps)
-What?

19:27.166 --> 19:29.236
-Hey.
-LASZLO: Elvis, you traitor.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.170
You only just met him
last night.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.039
LASZLO:
King, how could you do this?

19:33.072 --> 19:35.141
It was me who made you
a vampire.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.309
It is what it is.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.511
SIMON:
Ain't that the truth, Elvis?

19:38.545 --> 19:39.912
And Carol.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.748
Has anyone seen Carol?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.983
Shh. Guillermo, don't mention
that you vampire-slayed.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.753
-It's a bad look for me.
-Sorry, I-I'm hearing you
whispering.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.556
-Are you speaking of Carol?
-Uh, no, no.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.558
Do you know where Carol is?

19:51.591 --> 19:53.960
Probably somewhere alive.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.429
Okay.

19:56.463 --> 20:00.166
And so that's why you find,
on the Manhattan Bridge,

20:00.199 --> 20:01.868
a little more flexibility,

20:01.901 --> 20:04.604
as opposed to, say,
the George Washington Bridge,

20:04.637 --> 20:06.939
whose steel towers
are far more rigid.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.541
Right.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.277
Guess I thought you would
be interested in that,

20:10.310 --> 20:14.080
being a troll, that little
bit of bridge history.

20:14.113 --> 20:16.883
-Bridge-story, if you will.
-(groans)

20:16.916 --> 20:19.051
Come on, Simon,
you don't even know

20:19.085 --> 20:22.121
why you want that stupid,
stupid hat!

20:22.154 --> 20:23.856
I want what Laszlo has.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.892
What you and Nadja have.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.960
You have each other
and that is...

20:27.994 --> 20:30.263
-Is true love.
-...enough, it's enough.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.765
You're willing to settle,
and I envy that.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.534
* Visibly shaken,
heart is achin'... *

20:34.567 --> 20:36.369
Rapula, you know
I love the raps,

20:36.403 --> 20:38.738
but not right now--
I find it distracting, okay?

20:38.771 --> 20:41.207
So just...
Nothing satisfies me.

20:41.240 --> 20:45.211
My crew, i-it does not
fulfill me as it once did.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.915
Uh, I don't know who
some of these people even are.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.418
This guy, I don't know him.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.654
Look at my ex-accountant,
Ken, the zombie.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.888
Ah...

20:55.922 --> 20:57.890
Ah, indeed, Ken.

20:57.924 --> 21:01.661
You don't need this
very ugly headwear.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.430
It's too big for your face.

21:03.463 --> 21:06.132
It also has a giant curse on it!

21:06.165 --> 21:09.836
Well, now I want it a little bit
less, but I-I still want it,

21:09.869 --> 21:12.271
so I will-- oh.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.774
Seems as though my foot
is caught in the grating.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.576
No, it seems
as though my foot has fused

21:16.609 --> 21:19.946
with the metal
when I transformed from a bat.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.247
Ooh, boy.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.515
-Ooh, it's quite...
-LASZLO: You know what?

21:22.549 --> 21:24.083
-That looks quite...
-This is disgusting.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.284
...quite grisly and intense.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.453
You keep the hat.

21:26.486 --> 21:27.487
-Just keep it.
-It's quite painful.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.456
-LASZLO: We're off.
-(shouts)

21:29.489 --> 21:31.324
SIMON:
Ooh, I seem to be sinking.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.759
Count Rapula, please help me.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.127
I'm sorry me and the crew
ain't enough for you.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.630
Oh, I've hurt Rapula
and the whole crew.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.966
What's all this talk about you
not being fulfilled by us?

21:39.999 --> 21:42.101
I-I didn't mean that,
Elvis, please.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.303
-Oh... bye. I'm finished.
-Please, Elvis.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.673
What-- Neil? Patrick? Harris?

21:46.706 --> 21:49.175
No, you can't even make
eye contact with me.

21:49.208 --> 21:52.679
You wait here.
If that hat reappears, grab it.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.347
Carol? What about Carol?

21:54.381 --> 21:56.783
Guillermo didn't kill her!

21:56.816 --> 22:00.453
Why would you phrase it
like that?

22:00.487 --> 22:02.622
Did you see how I threw
the suspicion from you?

22:02.655 --> 22:04.457
-No, you threw
the suspicion on me, Master.
-SIMON: Help.

22:04.491 --> 22:07.494
-Help me, please.
-Damn it.
-Is he gonna drown down there?

22:07.527 --> 22:10.663
Why are you so interested
in how vampires are killed now?

22:10.697 --> 22:11.898
(Simon grunts)

22:13.900 --> 22:15.301
I'm not.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.437
I'm just, I just
asked a question.

22:25.211 --> 22:28.715
COLIN:
And so, I just would
like to apologize

22:28.748 --> 22:32.985
for any hurtful things
that I may have said to you.

22:33.019 --> 22:36.523
And, uh, oh, look,
the sun's coming up.

22:36.556 --> 22:40.760
Don't you knuckleheads
turn to stone when the...

22:40.793 --> 22:42.695
Yep, there it is.

22:42.729 --> 22:45.898
Guess I kept you talking
too long. (chuckles)

22:45.932 --> 22:48.668
The sun came up.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.269
This guy turned to stone.

22:50.302 --> 22:53.540
Sorry, Fred Mercury,
but I am the champion.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.575
(laughs)

22:57.043 --> 22:59.946
Shit.

22:59.979 --> 23:04.016
* Let me hold you tight,
my love *

23:04.050 --> 23:07.219
* It's not easy *

23:09.388 --> 23:12.191
* I want to hold you every day *

23:12.224 --> 23:16.062
* So that I can fall
in your love arms *

23:16.095 --> 23:18.931
* It's not easy *

23:21.067 --> 23:24.370
* Darling *

23:24.403 --> 23:27.607
* You've made me lose my mind *

23:27.640 --> 23:33.613
* It's not easy *

23:33.646 --> 23:36.983
* I want to lose
my mind every day *

23:37.016 --> 23:39.051
* So I can fall into... *

Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

23:46.025 --> 23:47.994
I would like to explore the idea

23:48.027 --> 23:49.762
of tokenism
in the workplace,

23:49.796 --> 23:52.164
where one minority is propped up

23:52.198 --> 23:54.834
to cover the experience
of the entire population.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.268
WOMAN: That's interesting.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.304
Wait. Sorry. You're not saying
you feel that way here?

23:58.871 --> 23:59.872

24:09.048 --> 24:10.182
MAN: This is your station.

24:11.350 --> 24:14.253
But what am I actually
doing here?

24:14.286 --> 24:16.155
I'm not gonna tell you.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.525
Don't worry.
You're gonna figure it out.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.803
MAN: I had no idea
what I would find

24:30.837 --> 24:32.639
when I went searching
for my father.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.441
They flashed the Zodiac Killer,
and my heart stopped.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.177
WOMAN: He believes
he is the son of the Zodiac.
