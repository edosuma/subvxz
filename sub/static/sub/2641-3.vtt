00:21.842 --> 00:24.191
Good morning.
Come dance with me.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.142
{\pos(192,220)}Why not?

00:31.282 --> 00:33.862
While I subscribe
to the many worlds theory

00:33.987 --> 00:38.133
which poses the existence of an infinite
number of Sheldons and universes,

00:38.258 --> 00:41.023
I assure you that none of them
am I dancing.

00:42.512 --> 00:44.478
{\pos(192,220)}Are you fun in any of them?

00:45.946 --> 00:49.139
{\pos(192,220)}The math would suggest
that in a few I'm a clown made of candy.

00:51.711 --> 00:53.218
But I don't dance.

00:53.885 --> 00:55.262
Want some French toast?

00:55.431 --> 00:56.638
It's oatmeal day.

00:58.343 --> 01:01.101
{\pos(192,220)}Tell you what, next French toast day,
I'll make you oatmeal.

01:01.544 --> 01:04.654
{\pos(192,220)}Dear Lord, are you still going
to be here on French toast day?

01:09.357 --> 01:10.467
Morning.

01:11.638 --> 01:13.155
Penny made French toast.

01:13.325 --> 01:15.557
Sorry I haven't given her
your schedule yet.

01:15.744 --> 01:17.160
It's an iCal download.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.910
She can put it right in her phone.

01:20.467 --> 01:23.248
And I thought we agreed that you'd have
your conjugal visits in her apartment.

01:23.904 --> 01:26.554
We did, but there were
extenuating circumstances.

01:26.679 --> 01:27.467
I see.

01:27.592 --> 01:30.464
Did her abysmal housekeeping skills
finally trump her perkiness?

01:32.788 --> 01:35.011
No, her bed kind of... broke.

01:37.816 --> 01:39.056
That doesn't seem likely.

01:39.298 --> 01:41.098
Her bed's of sturdy construction.

01:42.153 --> 01:45.593
Even the addition of a 2nd normal size
human being wouldn't cause a {\structural }failure.

01:45.718 --> 01:47.606
Much less a homunculus
such as yourself.

01:49.592 --> 01:50.776
A homunculus?

01:50.945 --> 01:53.139
Perfectly formed
miniature human being.

01:55.763 --> 01:58.313
You're my little homunculus.

01:59.468 --> 02:01.278
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

02:01.403 --> 02:03.247
Who wants syrup
and who wants cinnamon sugar?

02:03.415 --> 02:04.641
I want oatmeal.

02:05.627 --> 02:08.541
I want a boyfriend whose roommate
isn't a giant pain in the ass.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.925
I'm sure
that will happen soon enough.

02:12.790 --> 02:14.935
But in the meantime,
I still want oatmeal.

02:16.054 --> 02:17.954
You know what, I give up.
He's impossible.

02:18.079 --> 02:20.479
I can't be impossible. I exist.

02:21.308 --> 02:24.532
I believe what you meant to say is,
"I give up, he's improbable."

02:31.403 --> 02:34.341
You really need to find a better way
of dealing with Penny.

02:34.466 --> 02:37.591
What am I supposed to do...
eat French toast on a Monday?

02:37.716 --> 02:39.351
Now, that would be impossible.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.537
I'm just saying, you can catch
more flies with honey than with vinegar.

02:44.140 --> 02:46.999
You can catch {\even }more flies with manure.
What's your point?

02:48.152 --> 02:48.997
It's a...

02:53.362 --> 02:55.042
Boy, that does smell good.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.592
Too bad it's Monday.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.724
Episode 303: The Gothowitz Deviation

03:03.225 --> 03:05.274
Sync: Jess, Linwelin, Loky

03:19.699 --> 03:22.154
www.subbercafe.fr

03:25.723 --> 03:28.032
So Kim the night manager
went on maternity leave,

03:28.157 --> 03:29.751
And her husband's name is Sandy{\, right?}.

03:30.032 --> 03:31.002
{\pos(192,220)}So get this...

03:31.171 --> 03:33.512
{\pos(192,220)}Her replacement
is a woman named Sandy

03:33.637 --> 03:35.370
{\pos(192,220)}whose husband's name is Kim.

03:40.137 --> 03:41.096
I know.

03:41.532 --> 03:42.889
What are the odds?

03:43.197 --> 03:44.221
Easily calculable.

03:44.346 --> 03:46.596
We begin by identifying
a set of married couples

03:46.721 --> 03:47.754
with unisex names.

03:47.879 --> 03:49.959
{\pos(192,210)}We {\then }eliminate those unqualified
for restaurant work...

03:50.084 --> 03:52.622
{\pos(192,210)}The aged, the imprisoned
and the limbless, for example.

03:52.747 --> 03:54.322
Next we look at the...

03:55.158 --> 03:57.737
It's an amazing coincidence.
Can we leave it at that?

03:59.594 --> 04:00.594
{\pos(192,210)}I'm sorry.

04:02.644 --> 04:05.719
{\pos(192,210)}It's as if the Cheesecake Factory
is run by witches.

04:09.718 --> 04:11.893
{\pos(192,210)}It's as if
you don't think I'll punch you.

04:14.203 --> 04:15.880
Come on, you guys, let it go.

04:16.048 --> 04:17.094
Fine, whatever.

04:18.165 --> 04:19.394
Are you finished?

04:20.285 --> 04:21.220
{\pos(192,210)}Thank you.

04:21.404 --> 04:22.595
{\pos(192,210)}How thoughtful.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.931
Would you like a chocolate?

04:26.058 --> 04:27.158
Yeah, sure.

04:30.355 --> 04:31.225
Thanks.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.345
{\pos(192,210)}What was that?

04:37.103 --> 04:38.783
{\pos(192,210)}You said be nice to Penny.

04:38.908 --> 04:42.335
{\pos(192,210)}I believe offering chocolate to someone
falls within the definition of nice.

04:43.345 --> 04:46.548
{\pos(192,210)}It does.
But in my experience, you don't.

04:48.348 --> 04:50.718
{\pos(192,200)}There are more things in heaven
and earth, Horatio,

04:50.843 --> 04:52.500
Than are dreamt of
in your philosophy

04:53.029 --> 04:54.284
{\pos(192,200)}Now that's you.

04:54.409 --> 04:55.988
{\pos(192,180)}Obnoxious and insufferable.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.845
What's going on, day dwellers?

05:06.187 --> 05:09.727
Oh, man, did the Kiss Army
repeal "don't ask, don't tell"?

05:11.965 --> 05:15.231
{\pos(192,210)}Raj and I are going
to a goth club in Hollywood

05:15.356 --> 05:16.991
{\pos(192,210)}to hang with the night people.

05:18.611 --> 05:22.220
- Anybody want to come along?
- You're actually going out like that?

05:23.757 --> 05:25.362
I'm going out like this...

05:28.803 --> 05:29.788
What did you do?

05:29.998 --> 05:32.415
They're called tattoo sleeves.
Look.

05:33.670 --> 05:35.710
I got them online.
Raj got a set, too...

05:39.498 --> 05:40.983
Fantastic, right?

05:41.108 --> 05:44.072
Put them on, have hot sex with some
freaky girl with her business pierced,

05:44.197 --> 05:47.096
take them off, and I can still be buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.726
You know, I've always wanted
to go to a goth nightclub.

05:51.971 --> 05:53.423
- Really?
- Bazinga!

05:56.105 --> 05:58.870
None of you ever see
my practical jokes coming, do you?

05:59.949 --> 06:03.244
Okay, how about you two?
Look, I've got some extra tat sleeves.

06:04.705 --> 06:06.156
Why are you carrying extras?

06:06.326 --> 06:08.723
In case I snag one on
someone's nipple ring.

06:10.646 --> 06:11.746
I think we'll pass.

06:13.610 --> 06:16.130
Is the missus speaking
for the couple now?

06:17.587 --> 06:19.132
In this case, you bet she is.

06:22.220 --> 06:24.531
Yes, she's pushy,
and yes, he's whipped,

06:24.656 --> 06:26.406
but that's not the expression.

06:30.721 --> 06:33.895
Come on, I want to stop at Walgreen's
and pick up some more eyeliner.

06:39.178 --> 06:41.524
They're gonna get beaten up
at that club.

06:42.373 --> 06:44.473
They're gonna get beaten up
at Walgreen's.

06:48.690 --> 06:50.700
Sorry, Sheldon.
I almost sat in your spot.

06:51.246 --> 06:53.519
Did you? I didn't notice.

06:53.915 --> 06:55.068
Have a chocolate.

06:57.260 --> 06:58.321
Thank you.

07:11.409 --> 07:13.391
I think we're fitting in
quite nicely.

07:15.698 --> 07:18.396
It'd help if you weren't
drinking light beer.

07:18.948 --> 07:21.606
What's so gothic
about vodka and cranberry juice?

07:21.995 --> 07:24.234
Hello? It looks like blood.

07:24.509 --> 07:27.612
Did you even read the "wiki how" link
I sent you on being goth?

07:28.355 --> 07:30.449
No, I'm behind on my wiki-reading.

07:30.574 --> 07:33.285
I'm kind of on a John Grisham
kick right now.

07:33.797 --> 07:34.579
What?

07:34.747 --> 07:36.960
I finished reading <i>The Pelican Brief</i>
and loved it so much,

07:37.085 --> 07:38.887
I dived right into <i>The Client.</i>

07:39.012 --> 07:42.737
He was a lawyer himself, so his novels
are accurate as well as entertaining.

07:44.323 --> 07:47.237
Just remember we are lost boys,

07:47.362 --> 07:49.093
children of the night.

07:49.387 --> 07:52.813
Great. Lost boys.
Children of the night. Got it.

07:53.948 --> 07:56.090
Can you pass the chex mix please?

07:58.062 --> 07:59.124
Thank you.

08:02.885 --> 08:04.240
We are lost boys.

08:07.197 --> 08:08.361
Good for you.

08:08.531 --> 08:11.496
I'm actually much more lost
than he is.

08:13.762 --> 08:14.702
Nice ink.

08:15.715 --> 08:18.331
Thanks.
Can we buy you ladies a drink?

08:19.779 --> 08:20.790
Two light beers.

08:21.342 --> 08:23.946
Light beers.
Well, wiki-how about that?

08:25.788 --> 08:27.590
- What's your names?
- I'm Howard.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.146
- Raj.
- I'm Bethany.

08:29.489 --> 08:31.761
- Nice to meet you, Bethany.
- Yes, very nice.

08:31.929 --> 08:33.398
Nice to meet you, too.

08:33.839 --> 08:34.903
I'm Sarah.

08:35.028 --> 08:36.686
Not that anyone cares.

08:40.605 --> 08:44.023
Do either of you ladies enjoy
the novels of John Grisham?

08:53.779 --> 08:55.492
What's this cartoon called again?

08:55.779 --> 08:57.751
<i>Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.</i>

08:59.629 --> 09:00.903
It's not a cartoon.

09:01.028 --> 09:02.247
It's anime.

09:03.659 --> 09:04.671
Anime.

09:05.095 --> 09:07.253
{\You know, }I knew a girl in high school
named Anna May.

09:08.329 --> 09:09.930
Anna May Fletcher.

09:11.495 --> 09:13.526
She was born with one nostril.

09:14.039 --> 09:17.400
Then she had this bad nose job
and basically wound up with three.

09:23.218 --> 09:24.713
You're here a lot now.

09:27.043 --> 09:29.392
Am I talking too much?
I'm sorry. Zip.

09:29.685 --> 09:30.611
Thank you.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.405
Chocolate?

09:33.336 --> 09:34.438
Yes, please.

09:41.912 --> 09:42.707
Hey, Kim.

09:45.244 --> 09:47.837
You know what, hold on.
Let me take this in the hall.

09:55.338 --> 09:58.144
You'll never guess
who they got to replace you at work.

10:03.197 --> 10:05.562
- I know what you're doing.
- Really?

10:05.774 --> 10:08.815
Yes, you're using chocolates
as positive reinforcement

10:08.940 --> 10:11.402
for what you consider
correct behavior.

10:14.409 --> 10:15.580
Very good.

10:17.368 --> 10:19.764
- Chocolate?
- No, I don't want any chocolate!

10:24.826 --> 10:28.012
You can't train my girlfriend
like a lab rat.

10:29.350 --> 10:31.256
Actually, it turns out I can.

10:32.547 --> 10:34.592
Well, you shouldn't.

10:34.906 --> 10:36.761
There's just no pleasing you,
is there{\leonard}?

10:36.929 --> 10:37.970
You weren't happy

10:38.138 --> 10:39.720
with my previous approach{\to dealing with her},

10:39.845 --> 10:42.725
so I decided to employ operant
conditioning techniques,

10:42.893 --> 10:44.934
building on the works
of Thorndike and {\B.F.}Skinner.

10:45.223 --> 10:46.519
By this time next week,

10:46.690 --> 10:48.684
I believe I can have her
jumping out of a pool,

10:48.809 --> 10:50.937
balancing a beach ball on her nose.

10:52.539 --> 10:55.111
No, this has to stop now.

10:55.282 --> 10:58.770
I'm not suggesting we really
make her jump out of a pool.

10:59.568 --> 11:01.242
I thought the "bazinga" was implied.

11:02.627 --> 11:04.473
We're just tweaking her personality.

11:04.598 --> 11:06.623
Sanding off the rough edges,
if you will.

11:06.793 --> 11:08.834
No. You're not sanding Penny.

11:09.657 --> 11:12.471
Are you saying that I am forbidden

11:12.596 --> 11:15.329
from applying a harmless,
scientifically valid protocol

11:15.454 --> 11:17.008
that will make our lives better?

11:17.598 --> 11:19.969
Yes. You're forbidden.

11:23.457 --> 11:24.817
Bad Leonard.

11:33.773 --> 11:34.985
So, what do you guys do?

11:35.764 --> 11:37.201
You know, goth stuff.

11:37.326 --> 11:39.194
Goth magazines, goth music.

11:39.508 --> 11:40.627
{\pos(192,220)}Goth food.

11:41.703 --> 11:42.992
{\pos(192,220)}What's goth food?

11:45.638 --> 11:47.126
{\pos(192,220)}Blackened salmon?

11:48.793 --> 11:51.335
No, I meant what do you do for jobs?

11:51.763 --> 11:53.087
We're scientists.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.463
Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.

11:55.797 --> 11:57.383
What are the dark sciences?

11:59.056 --> 12:00.828
Well, I am an astrophysicist,

12:00.953 --> 12:03.179
and a lot of that
takes place at night.

12:04.826 --> 12:06.515
When there are vampires

12:06.640 --> 12:09.288
and miscellaneous
undead out and about.

12:10.579 --> 12:11.598
<i>Oy vay.</i>

12:13.516 --> 12:14.859
That sounds really cool.

12:16.245 --> 12:18.610
Does it? Okay.
If you like space stuff,

12:18.735 --> 12:21.106
I design components
for the International Space Station,

12:21.231 --> 12:22.247
which is in space.

12:22.372 --> 12:24.863
Where, as I'm sure you know,
no one can hear you scream.

12:28.768 --> 12:31.292
- So, what do you gals do?
- I work at the Gap.

12:31.647 --> 12:34.377
Really? How about that?
I've been to the Gap.

12:34.548 --> 12:37.681
I've been there, as well. I like
your t-shirts with the little pocket.

12:38.987 --> 12:40.456
I work there, too.

12:40.581 --> 12:42.017
Not that anyone cares.

12:44.692 --> 12:46.931
You know, this place is boring.

12:48.848 --> 12:51.060
Why don't we go somewhere else
and have some fun?

12:51.580 --> 12:53.646
- Okay.
- Sure, we like fun.

12:53.817 --> 12:56.685
- We are fun people.
- Dark and fun.

12:57.733 --> 13:00.178
Come on.
I know a place you'll really dig.

13:03.490 --> 13:05.582
- Did you bring the black condoms?
- In my fanny pack.

13:05.707 --> 13:06.707
Let's go.

13:14.207 --> 13:15.672
Are you happy now?

13:18.207 --> 13:19.531
Not particularly.

13:23.927 --> 13:25.511
Oh, my God, she didn't!

13:27.932 --> 13:30.184
What could she possibly
be talking about for so long?

13:30.849 --> 13:33.207
Obviously, waitressing
at the Cheesecake Factory

13:33.332 --> 13:35.884
is a complex socioeconomic activity

13:36.009 --> 13:39.160
that requires a great deal
of analysis and planning.

13:41.893 --> 13:43.133
Bazinga.

13:44.920 --> 13:48.020
You know, using positive
reinforcement techniques,

13:48.145 --> 13:50.764
I could train that behavior
out of her in a week.

13:52.584 --> 13:55.745
Let me use negative reinforcement,
I can get it done before we go to bed.

13:56.446 --> 13:59.396
You're not squirting her
in the face with water.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.040
Of course not.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.967
We're talking
very mild electric shocks.

14:04.208 --> 14:06.108
No tissue damage whatsoever.

14:07.203 --> 14:09.206
- Forget it.
- Oh, come on.

14:09.331 --> 14:10.391
You can't tell me

14:10.559 --> 14:12.833
that you're not intrigued
about the possibility

14:12.958 --> 14:14.686
of building a better girlfriend.

14:14.898 --> 14:15.898
I'm not.

14:16.167 --> 14:18.335
Penny's qualities,
both good and bad,

14:18.460 --> 14:20.310
are what make her who she is.

14:24.169 --> 14:26.864
You mean, like that high-pitched,
irritating laugh?

14:29.370 --> 14:31.820
You wouldn't prefer
a throaty chuckle?

14:32.539 --> 14:34.939
You're not changing
how Penny laughs.

14:35.588 --> 14:37.126
That would be incongruous.

14:37.386 --> 14:40.004
I was going to lower the whole voice
to a more pleasing register.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.022
{\pos(192,220)}Sorry, guys.

14:43.271 --> 14:45.160
{\pos(192,220)}That girl is freaky.

14:46.678 --> 14:47.678
Come again?

14:48.219 --> 14:49.178
Freaky.

14:49.648 --> 14:51.548
- Freaky?
- Yeah, freaky.

15:00.418 --> 15:01.768
Have a chocolate.

15:12.769 --> 15:14.393
Are you going to deface your body

15:14.518 --> 15:16.645
just for the possibility
you could have cheap sex

15:16.770 --> 15:18.417
with a strange girl
you met in a bar?

15:22.226 --> 15:23.671
What is your mother going to say?

15:23.967 --> 15:25.767
She's not going to see it.

15:25.954 --> 15:28.217
She takes my temperature orally now.

15:31.557 --> 15:32.997
What are you going to get?

15:33.122 --> 15:34.647
I can't really decide

15:34.772 --> 15:37.456
between a screaming devil,
this mean little skull,

15:37.581 --> 15:39.031
or Kermit the frog.

15:40.344 --> 15:41.971
- Kermit the frog?
- You know.

15:42.096 --> 15:44.006
<i>Hi-ho. I'm on Howard's butt.</i>

15:46.230 --> 15:47.815
Get the mean little skull,

15:47.940 --> 15:49.615
and I'll see
if I can make him smile.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.283
I'd like the mean
little skull, please.

15:53.032 --> 15:55.082
What are you going to get, Raj?

15:55.335 --> 15:57.035
With my luck, hepatitis.

15:59.189 --> 16:00.539
Okay, here we go.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.136
That's just rubbing alcohol.

16:04.824 --> 16:06.524
I know, but it was cold.

16:08.753 --> 16:10.259
I'm putting on the stencil.

16:10.429 --> 16:12.929
- What comes after the stencil?
- This.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.522
No needle. No pain.
No tattoo.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.903
What's the big deal?
You've done this before.

16:24.028 --> 16:25.990
No, I haven't. Look.

16:28.079 --> 16:30.574
I'm sorry. I'm a fraud.
He's a fraud.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.950
- We're both frauds.
- I think I covered that.

16:33.118 --> 16:34.668
But I was summing up.

16:37.326 --> 16:39.326
We're not goth.
We're just...

16:40.139 --> 16:41.139
Guys.

16:41.264 --> 16:42.864
Very, very smart guys.

16:43.302 --> 16:44.794
So you were totally scamming us?

16:47.437 --> 16:49.091
And I wouldn't blame you

16:49.260 --> 16:52.193
if you walked out of here
and never wanted to see us again.

16:52.638 --> 16:56.319
Unless, of course, our bold honesty
has suddenly made us attractive.

16:56.444 --> 16:57.894
Huh? Huh? Anything?

17:00.860 --> 17:01.960
I'm leaving.

17:06.451 --> 17:07.800
I'm leaving, too.

17:08.162 --> 17:09.762
Not that anyone cares.

17:17.451 --> 17:20.329
When we tell this story,
let's end it differently.

17:21.445 --> 17:24.688
What are you thinking?
Maybe a big musical number?

17:29.137 --> 17:32.485
Well, I'm going to make
some warm milk and then turn in.

17:33.324 --> 17:36.699
I trust if you two are planning
on engaging in amorous activities,

17:36.824 --> 17:38.681
you'll keep the decibel level
to a minimum.

17:39.479 --> 17:40.479
Of course.

17:40.889 --> 17:41.889
Thank you.

17:44.811 --> 17:46.349
These are so good.

17:48.292 --> 17:49.442
Unbelievable.

17:51.575 --> 17:52.575
What?

17:52.950 --> 17:55.741
I was just thinking
we should probably turn in, too.

17:56.305 --> 17:57.785
My new bed got delivered.

17:57.953 --> 18:00.036
If you put it together,
you can stay at my place.

18:00.463 --> 18:02.456
That's a lot of work,
and it's kind of late.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.540
But if we stay there,
we won't have to be quiet.

18:04.819 --> 18:05.819
Let's go.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.256
Interesting.

18:11.167 --> 18:14.930
Sex works even better than chocolate
to modify behavior.

18:17.917 --> 18:20.817
I wonder if anyone else
has stumbled onto that.

18:28.118 --> 18:29.567
Okay, wait.
How about this?

18:29.801 --> 18:32.001
We say there were four goth girls.

18:32.178 --> 18:34.414
The two girls in the club
had two friends.

18:34.824 --> 18:35.983
I like it, I like it.

18:36.342 --> 18:39.202
Did they smell good despite
their goth-like nature?

18:39.968 --> 18:41.162
What's the matter?

18:41.372 --> 18:43.873
Engaging my olfactory sense
helps make it real for me.

18:44.176 --> 18:45.876
Fine, they smelled good.

18:46.085 --> 18:48.585
They did.
Like jasmine and honeysuckle.

18:51.507 --> 18:54.505
Then they held hands and did
a sexy, demonic hokey pokey for us.

18:56.207 --> 18:59.223
Let me say my story then you say yours,
then we'll pick.

18:59.348 --> 19:00.348
Sorry. Go on.

19:00.676 --> 19:01.803
We got tattoos,

19:01.928 --> 19:04.227
and then the four girls
took us to their place.

19:04.437 --> 19:06.813
But we don't have tattoos.
What if someone asks to see them?

19:07.414 --> 19:09.914
We say
they're in a very intimate area.

19:11.002 --> 19:12.650
We're bad boys, aren't we?

19:16.240 --> 19:19.951
So, we go back to their place
and the six of us end up in a hot tub.

19:20.161 --> 19:21.384
But we just got tattoos.

19:21.509 --> 19:24.330
Wouldn't we be concerned
about bacterial infection?

19:25.341 --> 19:27.441
True. Okay.
Forget the hot tub.

19:27.664 --> 19:31.668
The point is, we each had
a <i>ménage</i> with sexy goth girls.

19:35.428 --> 19:36.878
What a great night.

19:45.619 --> 19:47.520
Want to try a country bar
tomorrow night?

19:48.006 --> 19:50.106
Maybe we'll get lucky
with some sexy cowgirls.

19:50.951 --> 19:52.101
Could happen.

19:55.023 --> 19:56.404
I wonder how they smell.

19:57.305 --> 20:03.820
