of the senate rules committee.

To vote you in
as vice president.

You need to believe
what the core believes.

You need to be one

37:18.804 --> 37:20.870
Ross' confirmation
was surely aided

37:20.872 --> 37:22.906
By president's grant's visit
to the democratic caucus.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.008
I think senator ross
is exceptionally qualified

37:25.010 --> 37:26.776
To be our next
vice president.

37:26.778 --> 37:28.378
That's why i voted
for her.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.846
The president
directly urging democrats

37:29.848 --> 37:31.481
To support his nominee.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.850
...As the next vice president
of the united states.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.785
She'll serve
this country well.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.787
<i>Now,</i>
<i>it's important to myself</i>

37:37.789 --> 37:39.856
<i>And certainly</i>
<i>my fellow members of congress</i>

37:39.858 --> 37:42.826
<i>That we support this president</i>
<i>in the direction...</i>

37:42.828 --> 37:46.029
Rachel, push my 8:00 back
a half-hour.

37:46.031 --> 37:48.932
This is too good to miss.
<i>...In that right direction.</i>

37:48.934 --> 37:50.000
[<i> camera shutter clicking</i> ]

37:56.441 --> 37:57.474
Hey.

37:57.476 --> 37:58.975
Hey.
[ clears throat ]

37:58.977 --> 38:02.779
If you're looking for your
mouth guard case, it's, um...

38:02.781 --> 38:04.381
I put it in the dishwasher.
It was gross, so --

38:04.383 --> 38:05.382
Abby.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.716
I fired you.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.818
I was right to fire you,
and if you can't handle that,

38:08.820 --> 38:10.720
If you can't handle me
doing my job,

38:10.722 --> 38:12.622
Me having some power --

38:12.624 --> 38:14.624
If dating a woman
who's one of the big dogs

38:14.626 --> 38:16.793
Is too hard for you,
then i'm fine being dumped.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.328
You can get your petty ass
out of my --

38:19.865 --> 38:22.332
[ the five stairsteps'
"ooh child" plays ]

38:24.836 --> 38:26.002
Do it again.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.804
What?

38:27.806 --> 38:29.156
Fire me.

38:29.157 --> 38:30.507
Only this time, put on
those high-heeled boots i saw

38:30.509 --> 38:31.708
In the back of your closet.

38:31.710 --> 38:32.909
[ chuckles ]

38:32.911 --> 38:33.943
¶ ooh, child ¶

38:33.945 --> 38:35.478
You're disgusting.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.448
I know.

38:38.450 --> 38:41.951
¶ ooh, child,

38:43.522 --> 38:47.057
¶ ooh, child,

38:49.094 --> 38:51.044
¶ someday, yeah ¶

38:51.045 --> 38:52.995
"that i will
well and faithfully discharge

38:52.998 --> 38:55.965
The duties of this office
of which i am about to enter."

38:55.967 --> 38:57.100
"so help me, god."

38:57.102 --> 38:59.636
"so help me, god."

38:59.638 --> 39:02.939
You did it, mom!
[ laughs ]

39:02.941 --> 39:04.074
Congratulations, susan.

39:04.076 --> 39:06.476
Ohh!
[ laughs ]

39:06.478 --> 39:08.445
You are gonna be
a great vice president.

39:10.449 --> 39:14.884
¶ ooh, child,
things will be brighter ¶

39:16.521 --> 39:21.891
¶ ooh, child,

and we'll get it undone ¶

39:38.009 --> 39:39.642
¶ someday, yeah ¶

39:39.644 --> 39:42.512
¶ we'll walk in the rays
of a beautiful sun ¶

39:42.514 --> 39:44.981
Where'd they find her?

39:44.983 --> 39:46.116
¶ when the world
is much brighter ¶

39:46.118 --> 39:49.586
Miss pope,
what happened to my lois?

39:49.588 --> 39:51.821
¶ ooh, child,
things are gonna be easier ¶

39:51.823 --> 39:54.557
[ sighs ]

39:54.559 --> 39:56.526
¶ ooh, child,
things will be brighter ¶

39:56.528 --> 39:58.928
They found her on a bench
in georgetown.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.397
Georgetown?

40:00.399 --> 40:03.800
Waterfront park --
the one next to the river.

40:03.802 --> 40:06.102
She had her head
tilted up to the sun,
her eyes were closed.

40:06.104 --> 40:09.572
The medical examiner said
it was an aneurysm.

40:09.574 --> 40:12.442
One of the best ways to go.
It happened so fast.

40:12.444 --> 40:14.711
There's not a moment
of pain.

40:14.713 --> 40:15.979
[ voice breaking ]
not one moment?

40:15.981 --> 40:17.013
¶ someday ¶

40:17.015 --> 40:19.482
Not even one.

40:21.720 --> 40:27.957
It's like she just fell asleep
on a warm, beautiful day...

40:28.994 --> 40:32.028
...With the sun
on her face,

40:32.030 --> 40:35.832
Listening to the sound
of the river.

40:35.834 --> 40:38.968
It's just too soon.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.438
¶ la, la, la-la, la, la-la-la ¶

40:41.440 --> 40:42.906
It's still too soon.

40:42.908 --> 40:43.973
[ sniffles ]

40:43.975 --> 40:46.609
You left way too soon.

40:46.611 --> 40:50.046
Lo, why did you have to go
and do that?

40:50.048 --> 40:51.881
Now i'm alone.

40:51.883 --> 40:54.017
I'm all alone, lo.

40:54.019 --> 40:56.186
All alone.

40:56.188 --> 40:59.088
Things ain't never gonna
be the same without you.

40:59.090 --> 41:00.723
¶ someday ¶

41:00.725 --> 41:02.792
Things just never
gonna be the same.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.095
They're never gonna
be the same, lo.

41:06.097 --> 41:07.564
Never gonna be the same.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.833
[ sobbing ]

41:09.835 --> 41:13.503
¶ ooh, child,

41:50.842 --> 41:54.010
Jake:
He said all of this?

41:54.012 --> 41:55.879
Huck actually said
all of this?

41:55.881 --> 41:57.814
Yeah.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.049
You need to shut this down,
rosen -- now.

42:00.051 --> 42:01.501
Of course i need
to shut it down.

42:01.502 --> 42:02.952
I go forward,
and we probably all go down.

42:02.954 --> 42:03.920
I know that.

42:03.922 --> 42:05.989
But here's the thing,
jake.

42:05.991 --> 42:07.223
I'm not gonna
shut it down.

42:07.225 --> 42:08.591
What?

42:08.592 --> 42:09.958
I'll do what i can
to protect us and olivia,

42:09.961 --> 42:11.194
But i'm going forward.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.195
You gave me those files.

42:12.197 --> 42:13.263
You said,
"go get the bad guys."

42:13.265 --> 42:15.265
I'm going to get
the bad guys.

42:15.267 --> 42:18.735
Rosen,
<i>we</i> are the bad guys.

42:18.737 --> 42:21.304
Not anymore.
