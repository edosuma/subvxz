10:31.326 --> 10:34.546
And yes.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.287
I'’ll take it all.
Anybody else?

10:36.374 --> 10:38.246
Oh hell, I got a garage
full of stuff.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.465
You'’d be doing me a huge
favor by clearing it out.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.642
A huge favor?

10:42.729 --> 10:44.469
Then why don'’t you pay the bill?

10:44.556 --> 10:48.299
Well, freaky Friday'’s over.

10:54.218 --> 10:55.437
Hey.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.004
Hey.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.354
How'’d it go?

10:59.441 --> 11:00.834
Kind of a disaster.

11:00.921 --> 11:01.835
Where were you?

11:01.922 --> 11:04.011
Elks, Beavers, Woodchucks?

11:04.098 --> 11:06.100
The Shriners.

11:06.187 --> 11:08.842
When I told them I was sober,
they started to boo.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.408
Aw.

11:10.495 --> 11:11.932
Where'’s Violet?

11:12.019 --> 11:13.150
She'’s sleeping.

11:13.237 --> 11:14.978
At 9:00?

11:15.065 --> 11:17.677
Apparently the good parties
don'’t start till 11:00.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.854
Did she even bother
looking for a job today?

11:20.941 --> 11:22.594
Who knows.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.509
I don'’t have the energy
to fight with her anymore.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.511
Well, lucky for you,
I'’m sitting on a lot of anger,

11:26.598 --> 11:27.991
and I need to squirt it
at somebody.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.560
[door opens]Wake up!

11:31.647 --> 11:33.475
VIOLET: What the hell?
Give me back my blanket.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.433
BONNIE:
It'’s my blanket, buck-o.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.131
Now here'’s how
this is gonna go,

11:37.218 --> 11:39.263
no more parties,
no more laying around here

11:39.350 --> 11:40.438
smoking reefer.

11:40.525 --> 11:41.309
VIOLET:
What'’s "reefer?"

11:41.396 --> 11:42.963
BONNIE:
Shut up.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.443
You have got till the end
of the week to get a job.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.184
VIOLET:
Why are you being so mean to me?

11:47.271 --> 11:48.403
My whole life
is falling apart.

11:48.490 --> 11:49.665
Don'’t let her play you.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.580
BONNIE:
Your life is falling apart

11:51.667 --> 11:52.668
'’cause you'’re stupid!

11:52.755 --> 11:54.322
Yes!

11:54.409 --> 11:55.715
BONNIE:
You need to move

11:55.802 --> 11:57.238
out of the problem,
and into the solution.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.413
Ow.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.544
VIOLET:
What'’s that mean?

11:59.631 --> 12:01.372
BONNIE:
It means stop

12:01.459 --> 12:03.374
feeling sorry for yourself
and get on with your life.

12:04.854 --> 12:05.812
Mom.
What?

12:05.899 --> 12:07.683
I love you so much right now.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.642
Oh, okay, thanks,
I love you, too.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.384
For your information,
I don'’t feel sorry for myself.

12:13.471 --> 12:14.603
Get back in there!

12:17.954 --> 12:20.304
Okay, that'’s it,
you'’re getting a hug.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.750
[sighs]
So, what do you think?

12:30.837 --> 12:33.187
Oh...

12:33.274 --> 12:35.885
my God!

12:35.972 --> 12:37.495
I know, it'’s a mess.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.106
Can'’t even park
my Range Rover in here

12:39.193 --> 12:40.629
'’cause of these damn Jet Skis.

12:40.716 --> 12:43.414
Since when do you play drums?

12:43.501 --> 12:45.199
My ex-husband took lessons.

12:45.286 --> 12:46.374
Really?

12:46.461 --> 12:47.418
Yeah.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.072
He had no rhythm in bed,

12:49.159 --> 12:52.946
I don'’t know why he thought
he could play the drums.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.599
What is that?
A hang glider?

12:54.686 --> 12:56.732
Yeah, he was into all kinds
of extreme sports.

12:56.819 --> 12:59.691
Hmm, explains why
he married an alcoholic.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.432
So all this stuff is his?
Yep.

13:01.519 --> 13:02.520
And he doesn'’t want it?

13:02.607 --> 13:04.087
Oh, he wants it.

13:04.174 --> 13:05.959
So how soon can you
get it all out of here?

13:10.920 --> 13:13.618
I don'’t know, Marjorie,
I did everything you said.

13:13.705 --> 13:17.144
I applied for, like, ten
scholarships and got nowhere.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.799
Yeah, I could apply
for a student loan,

13:19.886 --> 13:21.975
but I'’ll never get out
from under it.

13:22.062 --> 13:24.891
Yes, I'’m staying positive.

13:24.978 --> 13:27.197
[sighs]

13:27.284 --> 13:28.808
Yes, I know
it'’s all in God'’s hands.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.940
[mouthing]

13:32.072 --> 13:33.682
Behind you.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.771
I got to go,
my mother has a canoe.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.294
It'’s a kayak.

13:37.381 --> 13:38.339
Open 1A.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.080
What'’s happening?

13:40.167 --> 13:41.516
Hang on, let me put this down.

13:44.736 --> 13:45.825
Where did you get that thing?

13:45.912 --> 13:46.956
Jill'’s garage.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.392
She gave it to me to sell.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.438
I got stuff from everyone.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.875
Does Mrs. Hathaway know you'’re
using her apartment for storage?

13:52.962 --> 13:56.009
Mrs. Hathaway is in the hospital
in critical condition.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.141
She does not need the stress
of hearing from me.

13:58.228 --> 14:00.535
Then I guess
you'’re in business.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.102
I even came up with a slogan,

14:02.189 --> 14:03.843
"Don'’t junk it, Plunkett."

14:03.930 --> 14:05.757
How about,

14:05.845 --> 14:07.803
"Don'’t throw it away, Plunkay."

14:07.890 --> 14:09.544
What'’s "Plunkay?"

14:09.631 --> 14:11.807
Never mind.
I got to get to work.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.983
Is Violet here? I could use some
help with the Jet Skis.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.203
Believe it or not, she
and a bunch of her girlfriends

14:16.290 --> 14:17.508
went to Lake Tahoe
for the weekend.

14:17.595 --> 14:18.553
What?

14:18.640 --> 14:20.120
I told her to find a job.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.773
And I told her
to do the laundry,

14:21.861 --> 14:24.037
and I'’m still wearing
yesterday'’s pants.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.603
Hey, ask around
at the restaurant,

14:25.690 --> 14:27.214
see if anybody
wants to buy a guitar

14:27.301 --> 14:28.824
autographed by Sammy Hagar.

14:32.697 --> 14:34.395
Working on scholarships?

14:34.482 --> 14:36.179
No.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.964
Trying to find out if
the government breaks your legs

14:38.051 --> 14:40.227
when you can'’t pay back
your student loans.

14:40.314 --> 14:43.012
Why do you assume you won'’t
be able to pay them back?

14:43.099 --> 14:45.362
After you graduate,
you'’re gonna be a rich attorney.

14:45.449 --> 14:48.104
I was never doing this
to become a rich attorney.

14:48.191 --> 14:50.324
I want to help people
who are in trouble, you know?

14:50.411 --> 14:51.847
The downtrodden.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.544
Oh honey, when are you gonna
figure it out?

14:53.631 --> 14:56.547
Weare the downtrodden.

14:56.634 --> 14:59.115
Make a lot of money
so we can be the "up-trodden."

14:59.202 --> 15:01.770
[door opens]
VIOLET:
Hello?

15:01.857 --> 15:04.120
Oh, crap. In here!

15:05.252 --> 15:06.818
You want me to take this?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.211
No, she'’s my fault.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.386
Oh.

15:09.473 --> 15:10.735
Hey.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.433
Hey, how was your weekend?

15:12.520 --> 15:13.477
It was great.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.131
I won $38 at the casino.

15:15.218 --> 15:17.786
Look at that, Christy,
your money problems are over.

15:17.873 --> 15:21.050
Yeah, turns out I'’m really good
at slot machines.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.835
Anyway, the best part is
I got a job.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.402
Really? Where?

15:25.489 --> 15:26.577
At Harrah'’s.

15:26.664 --> 15:27.839
I'’m gonna be a blackjack dealer.

15:29.972 --> 15:32.496
Wait a minute,
you'’re moving to Lake Tahoe?

15:32.583 --> 15:35.151
Yeah, my friend Lindsay'’s dad is
a pit-boss and he hooked us up.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.631
We'’re gonna share an apartment
and go to dealer school.

15:36.718 --> 15:37.980
It'’ll be a blast.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.329
But what about
finishing college,

15:39.416 --> 15:40.461
making something of your life?

15:40.548 --> 15:42.419
I am making something: money.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.508
When people win at blackjack,
they give you a tip.

15:44.595 --> 15:47.294
So I figure, all I got to do
is make sure that they win.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.125
Oh, God, she'’ll be
stripping in a month.

15:52.212 --> 15:53.387
May I step in?

15:53.474 --> 15:54.736
Have at it.

15:54.823 --> 15:56.912
That sounds like
a terrific plan, Violet.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.392
Good luck.

15:58.479 --> 16:00.611
That'’s how you
step in? Step out.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.874
What? She'’s an adult.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.833
Maybe college isn'’t
the right thing for her now.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.966
So you'’d rather have
her deal blackjack?

16:07.053 --> 16:08.793
No, it'’s a terrible idea,

16:08.880 --> 16:10.491
but let her find out for herself
that she'’s an idiot.

16:10.578 --> 16:13.189
Thanks, Grandma.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.235
Anyway, I'’m gonna go lie down
for a little while.

16:15.322 --> 16:16.584
I'’m going out later
to celebrate.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.936
I can'’t believe this.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.459
Hey, look at the bright side,

16:22.546 --> 16:24.331
you now have one less
tuition to worry about.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.333
I don'’t care
about the money anymore,

16:26.420 --> 16:28.117
I just want her to be safe.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.641
Hey, I happen to remember
another cute, young blonde

16:30.728 --> 16:32.904
who left home early to find
her way in the world,

16:32.992 --> 16:34.819
and she turned out just fine.

16:34.906 --> 16:37.387
I wound up addicted to drugs,
alcohol, with a police record

16:37.474 --> 16:38.606
and two children.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.001
Maybe I wasn'’t talking
about you.

16:43.611 --> 16:46.309
[bell dings]

16:46.396 --> 16:47.919
Oh, my God.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.661
I got the scholarship
from the trial lawyers.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.620
Oh, honey, that'’s great!

16:52.707 --> 16:54.448
It'’s like Marjorie says,

16:54.535 --> 16:57.538
"When God closes a door,
he opens a window."

16:57.625 --> 16:59.018
BOTH:
Ow.

17:05.720 --> 17:09.028
ALL: ♪ Happy birthday,
dear Christy ♪

17:09.115 --> 17:12.204
♪ Happy birthday to you

17:12.291 --> 17:15.295
♪ Keep coming back.

17:21.127 --> 17:23.999
Three years sober,
I'’m so proud of you.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.348
Thanks, Marjorie.

17:26.435 --> 17:28.176
I don'’t know
what'’s more impressive,

17:28.263 --> 17:30.571
three years without a drink
or a whole week without crying.

17:30.658 --> 17:31.963
[all laugh]

17:32.051 --> 17:33.356
I just want to thank you guys.

17:33.443 --> 17:34.879
I couldn'’t have made
it through this year

17:34.966 --> 17:36.577
without you.

17:36.664 --> 17:39.971
I'’d like to say that
you'’re all my family,

17:40.059 --> 17:42.191
but that word has
such ugly connotations.

17:42.278 --> 17:43.671
[all laugh]

17:45.194 --> 17:47.240
How'’s it going
with the college tuition?

17:47.327 --> 17:49.068
Almost there.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.418
If I get the tax refund
I'’m hoping for,

17:51.505 --> 17:53.202
grab some extra shifts
at the restaurant,

17:53.289 --> 17:55.291
and perform my own root canal,
I might just make it.

17:55.378 --> 17:56.553
[all chuckle]

17:56.640 --> 17:58.860
Or...

17:58.947 --> 18:01.080
you could have a mother
who wants to make amends

18:01.167 --> 18:02.690
for not being there
the first time

18:02.777 --> 18:04.909
you tried to get an education.

18:04.996 --> 18:06.781
What'’s this?

18:06.868 --> 18:09.000
I sold Jill'’s Jet Skis for...

18:09.088 --> 18:10.263
how much did I tell you?

18:10.350 --> 18:12.526
$5,000

18:12.613 --> 18:14.484
Right, five grand.

18:14.571 --> 18:16.225
Anyway, that'’s my cut and...

18:16.312 --> 18:17.226
and now it'’s yours.

18:17.313 --> 18:18.227
Good luck at school.

18:18.314 --> 18:21.970
Oh, Mom, thank you.

18:22.057 --> 18:25.191
[quietly]: Don'’t count it
in front of Jill.
