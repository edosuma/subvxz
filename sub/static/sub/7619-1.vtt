(POPS)

13:49.872 --> 13:52.875
Basically, Lewis Ranieri's
mortgage bonds

13:52.958 --> 13:55.252
were amazingly profitable
for the big banks.

13:55.336 --> 13:59.298
They made billions and billions
on their 2% fee

13:59.381 --> 14:01.592
they got for selling each of these bonds.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.475
But then they started
running out of mortgages

14:03.552 --> 14:05.095

14:05.179 --> 14:07.848
After all, there are only so many homes

14:07.932 --> 14:11.685
and so many people with
good enough jobs to buy them, right?

14:11.769 --> 14:13.854
So the banks started filling these bonds

14:13.938 --> 14:16.106
with riskier and riskier mortgages.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.358
Thank you, Benter.

14:17.441 --> 14:21.987
That way they can keep
that profit machine churning, right?

14:22.071 --> 14:26.450
By the way, these risky mortgages
are called subprime.

14:26.534 --> 14:28.911
So whenever you hear "subprime", think

14:28.994 --> 14:30.454
"shit".

14:37.461 --> 14:40.214
were actually just mostly full of shit.

14:40.798 --> 14:43.551
So now he's going to "short" the bonds.

14:43.634 --> 14:45.636
Which means to "bet against".

Actually, my name's Jiang
and I do speak English.

Jared likes to say I don't
because he thinks

31:58.376 --> 32:00.211
it makes me seem more authentic.

to short this pile of blocks? How?

a credit default swap.

you can make 10-to-1,
even 20-to-1 return.

32:24.986 --> 32:27.405
No one is paying attention!

32:27.488 --> 32:30.950
Because the banks are too busy
getting paid obscene fees

32:31.034 --> 32:32.327
to sell these bonds.

Let's not talk about
my margins, by the way.

a bond too risky to buy,

warehouse it on the books? No.

So, what am I going to do?

34:29.569 --> 34:33.072
Throw all this unsold fish,
which is the BBB level of the bond,

34:33.156 --> 34:35.616

34:36.576 --> 34:37.577
No way.

I throw into a seafood stew.

See, it's not old fish.
It's a whole new thing!

And the best part is
they're eating 3-day-old halibut.

- Hold on. Hold on.

like they're as solid as treasury bonds,

they lost track of the market,

That is so cool.

Okay, look. If home prices don't go up,

54:12.292 --> 54:14.586
you are not going to be able to refinance.

54:14.669 --> 54:17.797
And you'll be stuck paying
whatever your monthly payment is

54:17.881 --> 54:20.592
once it jumps up
after your teaser rate expires.

54:21.009 --> 54:23.053

01:03:09.036 --> 01:03:11.456
Are they downgrading the CDOs
and mortgage bonds?

01:03:11.539 --> 01:03:12.623
Where are the ratings agencies at?

01:03:12.707 --> 01:03:14.208
They're the fucking same.

01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:15.793
No, they're all still AAA.

01:03:15.877 --> 01:03:18.379
What the hell?
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:03:18.463 --> 01:03:20.548

01:03:20.631 --> 01:03:23.631

is their bottom line and their shit.

01:03:23.676 --> 01:03:25.428
Hey, Mark, that's not all.

01:03:25.511 --> 01:03:26.804
The Morgan Stanley risk guys are here.

01:03:26.888 --> 01:03:28.264
They called in Kathy Tao.

01:03:28.347 --> 01:03:30.475
They're trying to convince her
to make us sell our swaps.

01:03:30.558 --> 01:03:32.810

of insurance payments

01:03:32.894 --> 01:03:34.645

01:03:36.105 --> 01:03:37.356
What did Kathy say?

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.151
Nothing yet. She keeps asking
if this is one of your crusades.

01:03:40.234 --> 01:03:42.153
Okay, I want you to walk back in there

01:03:42.236 --> 01:03:43.905
and very calmly, very politely,

01:03:43.988 --> 01:03:46.657
tell the risk assessors to fuck off.

01:03:46.782 --> 01:03:48.462
And then meet me over
at Standard & Poor's.

01:03:48.534 --> 01:03:50.036

01:04:30.243 --> 01:04:31.744
So...

01:04:32.245 --> 01:04:33.746

01:04:34.121 --> 01:04:36.624

01:04:37.166 --> 01:04:39.544
how can Standard & Poor's help you?

01:04:39.627 --> 01:04:40.878
VINNIE: Well, we don't understand why

01:04:40.962 --> 01:04:43.589
the ratings agencies haven't
downgraded subprime bonds

01:04:43.673 --> 01:04:46.717
since the underlying loans
are clearly deteriorating.

01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:49.220
Well, the delinquency rates
do have people worried,

01:04:49.303 --> 01:04:51.097
but they're actually within our models.

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.140
- So...
- VINNIE: Says you.

01:04:54.308 --> 01:04:56.727
...you're convinced
the underlying mortgages

01:04:56.811 --> 01:04:59.230
in these bonds are solid loans.

01:04:59.355 --> 01:05:01.232
GEORGIA: That is our opinion, yes.

01:05:01.315 --> 01:05:03.401
Have you looked at the loan-level data?

01:05:03.484 --> 01:05:05.236
I mean, they're giving these loans

01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:06.571
to anybody with a credit score
and a pulse.

01:05:06.654 --> 01:05:09.240
Excuse me, sir. What do you think
we do here all day?

01:05:09.323 --> 01:05:10.366
VINNIE: We're not sure.
That's why we're here.

01:05:10.449 --> 01:05:11.576
Here's what I don't understand...

01:05:11.659 --> 01:05:13.369
We check, recheck, recheck again.

01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:20.084
VINNIE: Ma'am, that's delusional.

GEORGIA: We stand behind them.

01:05:21.377 --> 01:05:22.962
MARK: Georgia,
have you ever refused to rate

01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:26.340
any of these bonds upper tranches AAA?

01:05:26.424 --> 01:05:28.009
Can we see the paperwork
on those deals?

01:05:28.092 --> 01:05:30.094
I am under no obligation
to share that information

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:31.262
with you, whoever you might be.

01:05:31.345 --> 01:05:33.055
Just answer the question, Georgia.

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:35.141
Can you name one time in the past year

01:05:35.224 --> 01:05:36.559
where you checked the tape

01:05:36.642 --> 01:05:40.855
and you didn't give the banks
the AAA percentage they wanted?

01:05:43.107 --> 01:05:44.275
If we don't give them the ratings,

01:05:44.358 --> 01:05:46.277
they'll go to Moody's,
right down the block.

01:05:47.194 --> 01:05:50.531
If we don't work with them,
they will go to our competitors.

01:05:51.198 --> 01:05:54.368
Not our fault.
Simply the way the world works.

01:05:58.706 --> 01:06:01.208

- Yes, now you see.

01:06:02.251 --> 01:06:04.295
And I never said that.

01:06:04.378 --> 01:06:06.797
They're selling ratings for fees.

You can afford to make less. Make less.

01:06:10.843 --> 01:06:12.720
Nobody said that.

01:06:12.803 --> 01:06:14.972
And it is not my decision.
I have a boss.

01:06:15.056 --> 01:06:16.390
Are you kidding me?

01:06:16.557 --> 01:06:17.850
No, I am not "kidding you".

01:06:17.933 --> 01:06:20.227

MARK: Is that the angle you're taking?

01:06:21.604 --> 01:06:25.149
So, now, anyone who has a boss
can't be held responsible

01:06:25.232 --> 01:06:26.672
for doing shitty and illegal things.

01:06:26.734 --> 01:06:28.319

No, I am not four, Mr. Baum.
I am not, no.

And I wonder what
your incentives might be.

01:06:36.285 --> 01:06:37.828
Is it maybe in your best interest

01:06:37.912 --> 01:06:40.915
to have the ratings change?
Is it, perhaps?

01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:45.252
How many credit default swaps
do you own? Hmm?

01:06:47.296 --> 01:06:49.173

how to value these CDOs,

Gentlemen.

01:12:28.554 --> 01:12:32.141
When do we get a chance to face time
with some of these lovely folks?

01:12:32.224 --> 01:12:33.642
Chris, give him the keycards.

01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:34.977
Do you even know which keycards
you're giving out?

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.061
- You're just giving them out?
- Thank you.

01:12:36.145 --> 01:12:38.856
First of all, how was your travel?
How are you? Uneventful?

01:12:38.939 --> 01:12:40.149
- Uneventful.
- Okay.

01:12:40.232 --> 01:12:41.942
I've been here for six hours.
I've already been to the gym,

01:12:42.026 --> 01:12:43.360
I had two poached eggs

01:12:43.444 --> 01:12:45.070
and I played blackjack
with Harry Dean Stanton.

01:12:45.154 --> 01:12:46.613
MARK: Thank you for your diary.

01:12:47.072 --> 01:12:48.699
Face time. I'd like some face time.

01:12:48.782 --> 01:12:50.242
Just remember.
We're here to gather information.

01:12:50.325 --> 01:12:51.744
We're gathering information, okay?

01:12:51.827 --> 01:12:54.204
We're not advertising
our short position. All right?

01:12:54.288 --> 01:12:55.914
We don't want to spook everybody.
Can you do that?

01:12:55.998 --> 01:12:57.541
I know you got a big mouth,
you like to run it.

01:12:57.624 --> 01:12:59.376
Can you just keep it shut for a few days?

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:00.586
Okay. Okay.

01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:02.504
Yeah, don't worry. We'll play nice.

Business is good.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:07.718
Profits are strong

01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:10.721
and the mortgage continues
to be the bedrock

01:13:10.804 --> 01:13:13.140
on which this economy is built.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

01:13:17.811 --> 01:13:19.396
And, yes, we had to take some losses

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:22.775
in our subprime department last year,
but those losses

01:13:22.858 --> 01:13:25.486
will be contained at only 5%.

01:13:25.652 --> 01:13:27.780
Now, in our residential sector...

01:13:27.863 --> 01:13:29.031
VINNIE: Mark, it's not a Q and A.

01:13:29.156 --> 01:13:30.824
...our rollout of those
variable rate packages

01:13:30.908 --> 01:13:32.534

01:13:36.497 --> 01:13:37.498
Uh...

01:13:37.664 --> 01:13:39.750
Sir, the Q and A is after my statements.

01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:42.252
But you know what? You seem anxious.
How can I help you?

01:13:42.336 --> 01:13:44.254
- Thank you. How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

01:13:44.338 --> 01:13:47.466
Would you say that it is a possibility

01:13:47.549 --> 01:13:52.179
or a probability that
subprime losses stop at 5%?

01:13:52.387 --> 01:13:53.472
Thank you.

01:13:53.555 --> 01:13:58.352
I would say it is a very
strong probability, indeed.

01:13:58.852 --> 01:14:01.396
So back to the residential sector.

Zero! Zero!

01:14:12.366 --> 01:14:15.119
There is a 0% chance

01:14:15.202 --> 01:14:18.997
that your subprime losses
will stop at 5%.

01:14:19.081 --> 01:14:20.201

When we were in Vegas, he did that.

01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:40.060
He said that, he took the call.

01:14:40.519 --> 01:14:42.229

about the performance

01:15:09.715 --> 01:15:11.300
of the underlying securitizations?

01:15:11.383 --> 01:15:13.177
It's easy to see that delinquencies

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:16.138

are on the rise right now.

being such a buzzkill, dude?

We didn't bring you out here
to talk about work, bro.

01:15:21.393 --> 01:15:22.853
Why did you bring us out here?

01:15:22.936 --> 01:15:26.148
Because we need to be able
to expense the ammo to a client.

Well, actually, we're

01:15:56.136 --> 01:15:58.639
about to invest in housing bonds, and...

01:15:58.722 --> 01:16:01.391
I was wondering if the SEC
is worried about them at all.

01:16:01.475 --> 01:16:04.228
I know you're not allowed
to tell me specifics, but just generally.

01:16:04.311 --> 01:16:06.521
Oh, we don't
investigate mortgage bonds.

01:16:06.605 --> 01:16:09.942
Truth is, since we got our budget cut,
we don't investigate much.

- I'm not here for the SEC.

We can do BBB-level swaps

like the bond is gonna collapse

going up? Really?

that we are in a completely

01:18:58.819 --> 01:18:59.903
Sure.

It's possible I'm wrong.
I just don't know how.

they never...

01:19:13.917 --> 01:19:16.169

01:19:24.469 --> 01:19:26.471
Even Bear upped their prices.

Don't take it personally.

the strip club in me tonight.

We need a deal, right? A deal.

We need a deal we can afford.

01:19:46.366 --> 01:19:48.660
We need a deal
that they're not gonna refuse.

01:19:48.743 --> 01:19:52.080
So... What can we do? We can...

01:19:53.373 --> 01:19:56.293
The AA tranches. What if we
bet against the AA tranches?

01:19:56.376 --> 01:19:57.711
Who's not gonna take that bet?

01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.339
We know they say
they're 95% AAA-rated,

01:20:01.423 --> 01:20:03.425
but in reality they're more like 25%.

01:20:03.508 --> 01:20:05.927
Some of them are 0%!

01:20:06.011 --> 01:20:08.638
We also know that if
the bottom tranches fail at over 8%,

01:20:08.722 --> 01:20:09.890
the upper tranches are affected.

01:20:09.973 --> 01:20:11.183
They go to zero.

01:20:11.433 --> 01:20:14.394
I'll bet you right now
that those AA's are actually like B's.

01:20:14.853 --> 01:20:17.939
I rarely ever say these words,
but I think Charlie's right.

01:20:18.273 --> 01:20:19.941
Look, Ben.

01:20:21.610 --> 01:20:23.028
The payoff

01:20:23.528 --> 01:20:24.946
is 200 to 1.

01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:27.073
But they're all taking
the ratings at face value.

01:20:27.199 --> 01:20:30.577
So they're charging pennies
on the dollar a bet against the AA's.

01:20:32.204 --> 01:20:35.040
Just when I start thinking
you guys are clowns...

01:20:35.123 --> 01:20:37.626
No one on the planet's
betting against AA's.

01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:40.629
The banks will think we're either high
or having a stroke.

01:20:40.712 --> 01:20:43.048
They'll take every dime we have to offer.

01:20:45.634 --> 01:20:46.968
Kinda brilliant.

01:20:48.762 --> 01:20:50.847
This is what we did
that no one else thought of.

01:20:50.931 --> 01:20:53.850
Not even Baum or Burry
thought to short the AA's.

01:20:53.934 --> 01:20:55.310

Oh, got no angle.
We're new to this. We're just excited.

You can buy as much
AA tranche as you want.

01:21:16.748 --> 01:21:18.875

Do you have any idea what you just did?

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.868
Come on. We just made
the deal of our lifetimes!

01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:55.120
We should celebrate.

01:21:55.203 --> 01:21:57.122
You just bet against
the American economy.

01:21:57.205 --> 01:21:58.707
Fuck, yeah, we did!

01:21:58.790 --> 01:22:00.750
- Fuck, yeah!
- Which means...

01:22:00.834 --> 01:22:03.503
Which means if we're right...

01:22:04.546 --> 01:22:07.924
If we're right, people lose homes.
People lose jobs.

01:22:08.008 --> 01:22:11.177
People lose retirement savings.
People lose pensions.

01:22:11.303 --> 01:22:12.470
You know what I hate
about fucking banking?

01:22:12.554 --> 01:22:14.097
It reduces people to numbers.
Here's a number.

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:17.017
Every 1% unemployment goes up,
40,000 people die. Did you know that?

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:18.602
- No.
- Did you know that?

01:22:18.685 --> 01:22:20.270
No, I didn't know that.

01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:23.398
We were just excited.

01:22:25.817 --> 01:22:27.819
Just don't fucking dance.

01:22:28.486 --> 01:22:30.326
CHARLIE: All right.
JAMIE: Where are you going?

01:22:34.701 --> 01:22:36.870
Whoa, I just got really scared.

01:22:38.413 --> 01:22:40.332
First of all, great show today.

01:22:40.415 --> 01:22:41.875
- You were terrific.
- Thank you.

01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:43.585
Your big mouth was a revelation.

01:22:43.668 --> 01:22:45.378
I appreciate that.

01:22:45.503 --> 01:22:47.255
You worried you and your swaps
are getting played?

01:22:47.339 --> 01:22:50.467
Well, this is an opportunity for you
to meet who you're betting against.

01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:52.344
Try not to get too righteous
and listen a little.

01:22:52.427 --> 01:22:53.803
Okay, fine. Who is this guy?

01:22:53.928 --> 01:22:55.597
JAMIE: <i>A real solid-gold asshole.</i>

01:22:55.764 --> 01:22:56.848
I'm a CDO manager.

01:22:56.973 --> 01:22:58.016
A "CDO manager"?

01:22:58.099 --> 01:22:59.517
Yeah, at Harding Advisors.

01:23:00.101 --> 01:23:03.229
I didn't realize that there was
anything to manage with CDOs.

01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:05.190
MR. CHAU: Oh.

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:08.485
We select the securities
that go into the CDO portfolio

01:23:08.568 --> 01:23:09.944
and monitor the assets.

01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:11.821
I do most of Merrill Lynch's CDOs.

01:23:11.905 --> 01:23:14.866
Do you represent the investors
or Merrill Lynch?

01:23:14.949 --> 01:23:15.992
The investors.

01:23:16.076 --> 01:23:17.118
You do.

01:23:17.202 --> 01:23:18.536
- Yeah.
- But...

01:23:18.745 --> 01:23:20.625
Merrill Lynch isn't gonna
send you any customers

01:23:20.705 --> 01:23:24.250
unless you put Merrill Lynch's bonds
in your CDO.

01:23:25.377 --> 01:23:28.088
Good question. Let's just say
Merrill and I have, um...

01:23:28.713 --> 01:23:30.799
We have a good relationship.

01:23:30.924 --> 01:23:33.134
You have a good relationship
with Merrill Lynch.

01:23:33.218 --> 01:23:34.886
We've been doing business
together for a long time.

01:23:34.969 --> 01:23:37.430
And so the CDOs that you create

01:23:37.555 --> 01:23:41.476
are of the highest quality
and the highest value.

01:23:41.559 --> 01:23:43.478
- Absolutely. Yep.
- Absolutely.

01:23:43.561 --> 01:23:47.107
Are you at all concerned
about the rising default rates?

01:23:49.067 --> 01:23:52.237
I assume no risk for these
products myself, Mark.

01:23:54.906 --> 01:23:56.074
Okay.

01:23:57.659 --> 01:24:00.829
So let me get this straight.
The bank calls you up.

01:24:01.413 --> 01:24:02.956
They give you the bonds
they want to sell.

01:24:03.039 --> 01:24:04.374
They give you clients,

01:24:04.457 --> 01:24:06.835
they give you money
to run your business.

01:24:06.918 --> 01:24:08.628
Give you fat fees for doing so.

01:24:08.712 --> 01:24:10.714
But you represent the investors?

01:24:10.964 --> 01:24:11.965
(CHUCKLES)

01:24:12.257 --> 01:24:13.299
Is that right?

01:24:13.425 --> 01:24:14.467
Yeah.

01:24:14.551 --> 01:24:16.010
But we're not
in the Merrill Lynch building.

01:24:16.094 --> 01:24:17.679
- Okay. Where are you?
- We're in New Jersey.

01:24:17.762 --> 01:24:19.848
You're 20 minutes away.

01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:21.850
Well, five if you use a helicopter.

01:24:23.727 --> 01:24:24.853
That's funny, huh?

01:24:24.978 --> 01:24:26.146
That's hilarious.

01:24:26.271 --> 01:24:28.398
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

01:24:29.357 --> 01:24:30.400
Oh, boy.

01:24:30.775 --> 01:24:32.986
Your boss is about to explode.

01:24:33.069 --> 01:24:34.696
No, he's too curious to explode.

01:24:34.779 --> 01:24:36.239
Hold on. Say that again.

01:24:36.322 --> 01:24:38.450
CDO "A" has parts of CDO "B".

01:24:38.533 --> 01:24:40.452
And CDO "B" has parts of CDO "A".

01:24:40.535 --> 01:24:42.787
But then they both
get put inside CDO "C".

01:24:42.871 --> 01:24:44.622
Yeah, that one's called CDO squared.

01:24:44.706 --> 01:24:46.791
A CDO of a CDO.

01:24:47.208 --> 01:24:48.209
All right?

01:24:48.376 --> 01:24:50.336
And then there's CDOs
made up of the opposite side

01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:51.963
of the bet you made with your swaps.

01:24:52.213 --> 01:24:54.507
We call them synthetic CDOs.

01:24:54.632 --> 01:24:56.801
What did you say? Synthetic CDOs.

01:24:56.885 --> 01:24:58.595
That is fucking crazy.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.388
It's not. It's awesome.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

01:25:09.397 --> 01:25:11.316
All right, let's say

01:25:11.816 --> 01:25:15.153
you have a pool of $50 million
in subprime loans.

01:25:15.487 --> 01:25:18.072
How much money could be
out there betting on it,

01:25:18.156 --> 01:25:20.950
in your synthetic CDOs and swaps

01:25:21.034 --> 01:25:22.619
right now, tonight?

01:25:22.702 --> 01:25:25.330
Let's see, $50 million... Hmm...

01:25:26.331 --> 01:25:27.331
A billion dollars.

01:25:27.373 --> 01:25:28.374

01:25:31.503 --> 01:25:32.837
<i>were the match...</i>

01:25:34.255 --> 01:25:36.674
How much bigger is the market
for insuring mortgage bonds

01:25:36.758 --> 01:25:38.218
than actual mortgages?

01:25:39.385 --> 01:25:40.553
About 20 times.

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.806
JARED: <i>If the mortgage bonds
were the match</i>

01:25:42.889 --> 01:25:45.600
<i>and the CDOs were
the kerosene-soaked rags,</i>

01:25:45.683 --> 01:25:47.727

<i>and Selena Gomez to explain.</i>

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.050
Okay. So here's how
a synthetic CDO works.

01:26:19.133 --> 01:26:22.011
Let's say I bet $10 million
on a blackjack hand.

01:26:22.095 --> 01:26:24.597
$10 million because this hand
is meant to represent

01:26:24.973 --> 01:26:27.225
a single mortgage bond.

01:26:30.186 --> 01:26:33.606
Okay, Selena has a pretty good
hand here, showing 18.

01:26:33.731 --> 01:26:34.732
Dealer showing seven.

01:26:34.816 --> 01:26:36.860
That's a really good hand for Selena.

01:26:36.943 --> 01:26:38.361
Good odds. In fact,
her chances of winning

01:26:38.444 --> 01:26:40.822
<i>this hand are 87%.</i>

01:26:40.905 --> 01:26:44.284
So, my odds are good.
I'm on a winning streak.

01:26:44.367 --> 01:26:47.036
Everybody in this place
wants to get in on the action.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.496
How could I lose, right?

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:50.081
Now, this is a classic error.

01:26:50.164 --> 01:26:53.126
In basketball it's called
the Hot Hand Fallacy.

01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:55.753
A player makes a bunch
of shots in a row.

01:26:55.837 --> 01:26:58.131
People are sure they're
gonna make the next one.

01:26:58.214 --> 01:27:00.174
<i>People think that whatever's
happening now</i>

01:27:00.258 --> 01:27:03.011
<i>is gonna continue to
happen into the future.</i>

01:27:03.094 --> 01:27:06.431
<i>During the real estate boom,
markets were going up and up</i>

01:27:06.514 --> 01:27:08.234
and people thought
they would never go down.

01:27:08.266 --> 01:27:10.810
So people who are watching
and think that I won't lose

01:27:10.894 --> 01:27:12.353
will make a side bet.

01:27:12.437 --> 01:27:14.689
Now, this is the first synthetic CDO.

01:27:14.772 --> 01:27:16.357
I love Selena Gomez.

01:27:16.441 --> 01:27:17.942
I bet you $50 million she wins.

01:27:18.026 --> 01:27:20.111
And I'll give you 3-to-1 odds.

01:27:20.194 --> 01:27:24.032
3-to-1 odds? Okay, I'll take that bet.

01:27:24.115 --> 01:27:27.452
RICHARD: Now, somebody else
is gonna want to make a bet

01:27:27.535 --> 01:27:28.661
on the outcome of their bet.

01:27:28.828 --> 01:27:29.954
Bet you 50 million she wins.

01:27:30.038 --> 01:27:32.999
That will lead to synthetic
CDO number two.

01:27:33.082 --> 01:27:36.252
Hey, I bet you $200 million
that lady in the glasses

01:27:36.419 --> 01:27:37.921
wins that bet.

01:27:38.087 --> 01:27:41.174
She probably will win.
So I want a great payoff.

01:27:41.341 --> 01:27:42.425
How about 20-to-1?

01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:43.676
Deal.

01:27:44.010 --> 01:27:48.306
And this will go on and on with more
and more synthetic CDOs.

01:27:48.389 --> 01:27:52.435
And we can transform an original
$10 million investment

01:27:52.602 --> 01:27:54.520
into billions of dollars.

01:27:55.438 --> 01:27:56.773

That, yes,
Morgan has suffered some losses,

01:42:04.203 --> 01:42:07.998

and there's no cause for concern.

01:42:08.207 --> 01:42:11.043
Would Bennie Cleager be concerned?

01:42:11.376 --> 01:42:12.711
Because word on the street

01:42:12.795 --> 01:42:15.631

Okay.

01:42:25.098 --> 01:42:28.143
Two years ago, Bennie Cleager
in Morgan's bond department

01:42:28.227 --> 01:42:31.772
also started shorting subprime housing,
$2 billion in BBBs.

01:42:31.855 --> 01:42:33.106
Bennie is smarter than I thought.

01:42:33.190 --> 01:42:34.608
No, he's not smart at all.

01:42:34.691 --> 01:42:37.069
The premiums on the swap
ate into his desk's profit.

01:42:37.152 --> 01:42:39.112
To cover his BBB shorts,

01:42:39.196 --> 01:42:41.698
he sold a lot of A and AA swaps
as protection.

01:42:41.782 --> 01:42:42.783
A lot.

01:42:43.492 --> 01:42:46.662
He believed that there was no way
that they could be affected.

01:42:47.246 --> 01:42:50.582
Tell me Morgan Stanley doesn't hold
the contracts on these swaps.

01:42:53.919 --> 01:42:55.420
Holy shit.

01:42:56.088 --> 01:42:59.508

01:44:03.739 --> 01:44:06.074
and we pay their fucking gambling debt?

01:44:06.575 --> 01:44:09.077

01:44:12.998 --> 01:44:15.000
