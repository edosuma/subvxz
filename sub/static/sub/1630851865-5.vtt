Hey, Ollie! What's... Huh?

00:38.040 --> 00:39.839
-Whoa!
-Wow!

00:39.960 --> 00:43.879
That is the hugest,
most amazing meatball I've ever seen!

00:44.000 --> 00:46.879
-Did you make it yourself?
-Yep! Hungry!

00:47.400 --> 00:49.160
It looks marvelicious!

00:49.280 --> 00:51.839
Oh! We have to do
something special with it!

00:51.960 --> 00:54.279
Oh, I am! I'm going to...

00:54.400 --> 00:55.720
eat it!

00:56.040 --> 00:58.839
-Ah!
-Wait! Ollie, no!

00:59.919 --> 01:00.959
You can't just...

01:01.839 --> 01:04.200
eat that meatball!

01:04.319 --> 01:08.160
You have to stop
and appreciate the amazing things in life

01:08.280 --> 01:11.479
-and celebrate them!
-Hmm.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.720
Meatball celebrated. Time to eat!

01:17.840 --> 01:20.600
But, Ollie, you've made
the most amazing meatball

01:20.800 --> 01:22.720
the world has ever seen!

01:22.880 --> 01:24.920
You can't just eat it
with a plastic spoon,

01:25.119 --> 01:26.520
standing on a ladder!

01:26.640 --> 01:29.119
[gasps]
Hold on! I'm having a brainstorm!

01:29.759 --> 01:31.920
Oh, no. When you have a brainstorm,

01:32.080 --> 01:34.280
I always get dragged off somewhere.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.880
We'll throw a meatball feast
in your honour!

01:37.000 --> 01:40.479
-It'll be an event!
-But I'm hungry right now.

01:41.720 --> 01:43.759
Only the best ingredients will do.

01:43.920 --> 01:46.440
[gasps]
I've got it! We'll go to Italy.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.240
It's the land of spaghetti and ravioli!

01:49.360 --> 01:51.039
Oh! And don't forget the cheese.

01:51.160 --> 01:54.280
Italy's famous the world over
for its cheese!

01:54.399 --> 01:56.559
Wait. Cheese? I'm in.

01:56.720 --> 02:00.600
Yay! Let's pack up
and go cook a meatball feast!

02:02.800 --> 02:04.440
[Moon]
OK, I'm lifting!

02:05.119 --> 02:06.080
You get that end!

02:06.240 --> 02:08.239
[Ollie]
It's a sphere. There are no ends!

02:10.320 --> 02:11.560
-Yay!
-Yay!

02:18.000 --> 02:19.440
Whee!

02:27.040 --> 02:29.720
Moon, can I just have one bite?

02:29.920 --> 02:31.160
No, not yet!

02:31.280 --> 02:34.200
<i>Everybody, say hello to Italy!</i>

02:39.959 --> 02:43.079
[whistling]

02:44.840 --> 02:47.560
Moon, I thought we were heading into town.

02:47.679 --> 02:49.359
You know, to get our feast ingredients.

02:49.519 --> 02:51.799
We are, Ollie!
We're just taking the long way

02:51.959 --> 02:55.200
so we can see this beautiful
Italian countryside!

02:55.320 --> 02:58.840
The long way?
How long the long way? Is it long?

02:58.959 --> 03:01.799
Don't be in such a hurry, Ollie.
We'll get there.

03:01.959 --> 03:03.959
-Right, Lorenzo?
-You betcha!

03:05.079 --> 03:06.120
Hmm?

03:08.440 --> 03:09.640
[straining]

03:09.760 --> 03:13.359
Say, this is one <i>grande </i>meatball
you have here!

03:13.519 --> 03:16.160
-Where did you get it?
-My friend, Ollie, made it!

03:16.320 --> 03:18.079
Isn't it marvellous?

03:18.320 --> 03:21.280
You are a meatball genius, my<i> amico!</i>

03:22.079 --> 03:25.000
-My who?
-My <i>amico, </i>my friend!

03:25.160 --> 03:26.880
Oh! Well, my <i>amico</i>,

03:27.040 --> 03:28.799
we're cooking up a fancy meatball feast

03:28.959 --> 03:31.160
when we get to town. You should come!

03:42.760 --> 03:43.920
Ah!

03:46.320 --> 03:47.480
Phew!

03:49.200 --> 03:50.359
No!

03:55.480 --> 03:59.160
-No! Runaway meatball!
-Oh, boy!

04:13.640 --> 04:17.640
Hurry! Without that meatball,
there's no meatball feast!

04:27.560 --> 04:29.840
-<i>Mamma mia!</i>
-What's going on?

04:30.240 --> 04:32.360
-Why are we stopping?
-So sorry,

04:32.520 --> 04:35.640
but my teeny-tiny taxi's
itty-bitty gas tank...

04:35.960 --> 04:38.280
It's <i>finito. </i>Empty!

04:41.360 --> 04:44.960
But the meatball's getting away
and I'm so hungry!

04:45.120 --> 04:47.719
That's OK, Ollie. It will stop eventually.

04:47.919 --> 04:49.760
And there's no better way to see a place

04:49.880 --> 04:52.080
than by taking a nice, slow...

04:52.280 --> 04:55.080
Run!

04:55.640 --> 04:57.640
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.280
I'm always afraid
you're going to say that.

05:00.400 --> 05:05.120
Oh! I've never seen
a snail like you before!

05:05.280 --> 05:08.280
I must paint you. Please, sit for me.

05:08.919 --> 05:11.800
Sit? Me? Well, if I have to.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.680
Oh! Wonderful!

05:16.440 --> 05:19.039
[Ollie]
Run! Come on, we gotta get it!

05:21.080 --> 05:23.400
-So hard to keep up!
-No kidding!

05:23.520 --> 05:26.159
I'm sure glad I had
a good lunch before we left!

05:26.320 --> 05:29.919
I would've had a good lunch too
if you hadn't rolled it out the door!

05:30.080 --> 05:34.359
Hey, Ollie, look! It stopped!
I told you it'd be OK!

05:35.120 --> 05:37.159
Finally, time to celebrate and eat

05:37.320 --> 05:39.359
Ollie's magnificent ball of meat!

05:39.520 --> 05:40.880
Finally!

05:41.400 --> 05:42.800
Ollie, you coming?
[Ollie gasps]

05:42.960 --> 05:45.599
Gotta get the giant feastball
and get cooking!

05:45.719 --> 05:48.120
-Check out this view!
-Wow!

05:49.919 --> 05:54.880
I was so busy chasing a giant meatball
that I didn't even notice it.

06:00.840 --> 06:03.120
See? Just like I said, Ollie.

06:03.240 --> 06:06.560
You have to stop and appreciate
the amazing things in life.

06:06.680 --> 06:09.680
You're right, Moon.
I'm really looking forward to this.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.919
A big Italian feast celebrating my...

06:13.080 --> 06:14.359

Ah! Runaway meatball!

06:53.240 --> 06:55.880
If there were a giant meatball in it!

06:56.039 --> 06:57.159
Come on!

07:00.200 --> 07:02.919
[panting]

07:03.039 --> 07:05.760
-It's quiet.
-Too quiet.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.719
Where's my meatball?
My tummy wants to know.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.680
Not sure. But look at that!

07:13.640 --> 07:16.719
Is it just me, or is that tower leaning?

07:16.840 --> 07:19.159
It's not just leaning, my friends!

07:19.479 --> 07:22.359
It's the Leaning Tower of Pisa!

07:22.479 --> 07:25.320
Isn't it amazing? Look at that!

07:25.440 --> 07:27.440
People come from all over the world

07:27.560 --> 07:31.239
to see our tower that leans
and yet doesn't fall down!

07:32.560 --> 07:34.960
That's so kooky and fun!
[rumbling]

07:38.719 --> 07:40.719
You appreciating this, Ollie?

07:40.880 --> 07:42.520
-Uh-huh.
-What a neat building!

07:45.239 --> 07:46.760
Ah!

07:46.880 --> 07:49.840
Except my meatball is heading
right for the neat building!

07:49.960 --> 07:51.919
And is about to destroy the neat building!

07:52.039 --> 07:54.039
[screaming]

07:55.440 --> 07:58.719
Ollie, if your meatball wrecks
the Leaning Tower of Pisa,

07:58.840 --> 08:01.599
no one will want to celebrate it,
not even me!

08:01.760 --> 08:05.000
You're right! We have to stop it! But how?

08:05.120 --> 08:08.039
Thinking... thinking... thinking...

08:08.719 --> 08:10.919
Panicking... Aha!

08:20.640 --> 08:22.080
Oh!

08:24.039 --> 08:26.560
[cheering]

08:26.679 --> 08:28.400
You're a hero, my <i>amico!</i>

08:28.520 --> 08:30.840
You saved our leaning tower!

Now, we celebrate you!

-Now can I eat?

08:48.680 --> 08:49.840
Wait, Ollie.

08:49.959 --> 08:52.560
Remember how we talked about
stopping to appreciate

08:52.720 --> 08:54.280
the amazing things in life?

08:54.400 --> 08:58.120
Let's just stop a moment
to celebrate these amazing smells!

08:58.240 --> 09:00.959
Really? OK.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.520
Mmm! Meatball, spaghetti...

09:06.079 --> 09:11.920
[sniffs]
Ravioli and... Oh! Bean soup!

09:12.040 --> 09:14.319
-Amazing!
-Amazing!

09:14.480 --> 09:16.560
[sounds of scoffing down food]

09:16.720 --> 09:18.839
What? No!

09:18.959 --> 09:20.319
Huh? Where's the meatball?

09:20.760 --> 09:23.280
No!

09:25.720 --> 09:30.319
But I didn't... get... a single... bite!

09:30.480 --> 09:34.280
Not a slurp, not a sliver,
not a lick! And it's gone!

09:34.880 --> 09:35.800
Gone!

09:35.920 --> 09:38.560
Maybe you didn't get to taste
your meatball, Ollie,

09:38.680 --> 09:40.880
but everyone else appreciated it.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.160
-That's enough, isn't it?
-Not even close.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.319
[sighs]
I guess we should just...

09:48.480 --> 09:50.400
[sniffs]
go home now.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.680
-My <i>amico?</i>
-Hmm?

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
In Italy we have many courses.
And now it's time for...

10:02.360 --> 10:05.160
<i>-il formaggio!</i>
-What's that?

10:07.920 --> 10:10.439
The cheese! For you.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.160
In appreciation of your saving our tower.

10:13.319 --> 10:17.760
Thank you!
I can't even... I just... I don't...

10:17.920 --> 10:20.160
Oh! It's so beautiful!

10:24.720 --> 10:26.280
Uh-oh.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.280
Ah!

10:29.439 --> 10:31.880
[Moon]
Runaway cheese wheel!

10:33.839 --> 10:35.160
Amazing!

10:43.520 --> 10:45.800
Yup. Sometimes you just have to stop

10:45.920 --> 10:48.360
and celebrate the amazing things in life.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.560
You said it, Moon.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.120
You said it, Moon!

10:51.640 --> 10:54.360
Mmm. Mmm.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.560
Say "cheese wheel!"

10:56.680 --> 10:59.360
Cheese wheel!
