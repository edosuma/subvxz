     I can't now, Michael.      

00:56.723 --> 01:00.458
             I just finished my 
             nails. They're wet.

01:00.460 --> 01:01.660
You know, you have              

01:01.662 --> 01:03.561
the worst timing                
in the world.                   

01:03.563 --> 01:05.363
     I mean, look at this.      

01:05.364 --> 01:07.165
    We have the whole house     
          to ourselves          

01:07.167 --> 01:08.266
    and you have wet nails.     

01:10.435 --> 01:11.970
            Michael,            
    you should have asked me    

01:11.972 --> 01:14.139
  just even five minutes ago.   

01:14.141 --> 01:16.474
    I did. I asked you          
    five minutes ago.           

01:16.476 --> 01:18.476
    You see that? You never     
    pay any attention to me.    

01:18.478 --> 01:20.378
    Oh, Michael, I do too.      

01:20.380 --> 01:22.613
    You do not. You do not.     
     I'll prove it to you.      

01:22.615 --> 01:24.816
How many fingers                
do I have up?                   
                      Three.    

01:24.818 --> 01:26.685
How many now?                   
                          Three.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.419
 How many now?                  
                      Three.    

01:28.421 --> 01:29.554
How many now?                   
                          Three.

01:29.556 --> 01:32.290
No! I have                      
four fingers up now.            

01:32.292 --> 01:33.692
            You don't have four.
            You have three.     

01:33.694 --> 01:34.893
Four.                           
                          Three.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.327
Four.                           
                    Three.      

01:36.329 --> 01:38.296
Gloria, if I am wrong--         

01:38.298 --> 01:40.331
If I am wrong,                  
will you pay me 5 dollars?      

01:40.333 --> 01:41.566
                     Sure.      

01:41.568 --> 01:43.735
All right, I'm wrong.           

01:43.737 --> 01:45.103
Ah, you see that?               

01:45.105 --> 01:46.604
You never pay                   
any attention to me.            

01:46.606 --> 01:47.672
                        Michael.

01:51.711 --> 01:52.744
GLORIA:                         
Hi, Ma.                         

01:52.746 --> 01:53.845
MICHAEL:                        
Hi, Ma.                         

01:53.847 --> 01:55.880
             Hello.             

01:55.882 --> 01:58.116
Can I help you                  
with your package, Ma?          

01:58.118 --> 01:59.884
     Oh, yes, Mike, thanks.     

02:04.724 --> 02:06.591
          Ma, what's the matter?
          Something wrong?      

02:09.862 --> 02:12.263
Something's wrong with Ma,      
            Michael.            

02:12.265 --> 02:14.398
        I better go see         
    what's the matter.          

02:16.501 --> 02:18.803
                     Uh, Ma?    

02:18.805 --> 02:22.540
              Wh-- Why don't you
              sit down?         

02:22.542 --> 02:24.776
              Uh, would you like
              a cup of coffee?  

02:24.778 --> 02:26.144
I'll get it.                    

02:28.914 --> 02:30.815
            Would you like to   
            tell me about it?   

02:30.817 --> 02:32.083
No, no, Gloria,                 

02:32.085 --> 02:33.818
I can't tell                    
you about it.                   

02:33.820 --> 02:35.686
                    Come on, Ma.
No, no.                         

02:35.688 --> 02:37.856
          I told you.           
I can't tell you about it.      

02:37.858 --> 02:40.491
 I can't tell nobody about it.  
         Never, never.          

02:40.493 --> 02:43.261
                  All right.    
             It's all right, Ma.

02:43.263 --> 02:45.130
You don't have to               
tell me about it.               

02:45.132 --> 02:46.731
        I was arrested!         

02:49.034 --> 02:50.802
    You were arrested?          

02:50.804 --> 02:52.103
    For what?                   

02:52.105 --> 02:54.538
      I told you, Gloria,       
I can't tell you about it.      

02:54.540 --> 02:57.142
    I'm a shoplifter!           

02:57.144 --> 03:00.211
You were arrested               
for shoplifting?                

03:00.213 --> 03:01.746
            You were arrested   
            for shoplifting?    

03:01.748 --> 03:03.848
      Now everybody knows!      

03:03.850 --> 03:05.449
Gloria,                         
what's going on?                

03:06.819 --> 03:08.619
  Ma, it's all a big mistake,   
        isn't it?               

03:08.621 --> 03:09.520
                     No, Gloria.

03:13.225 --> 03:17.195
     I'm sorry, but I think     
there's something wrong with me.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.564
    Yeah. I've started          
         taking things.         

03:20.566 --> 03:23.768
 I think I'm one of them people 
        that, you know,         

03:23.770 --> 03:24.903
can't help taking things.       

03:24.905 --> 03:27.338
Ma, Ma, you're not              
a kleptomaniac.                 

03:27.340 --> 03:28.539
        That's the word.        

03:28.541 --> 03:30.241
You're not that.                

03:30.243 --> 03:33.411
Yeah, it's come down to me      
     from my Aunt Gertrude.     

03:33.413 --> 03:39.184
     She was... She was one     
     of them kleppers too.      

03:39.186 --> 03:42.586
Ma, you don't                   
inherit kleptomania.            

03:42.588 --> 03:44.689
  Oh, she was a lovely person,  

03:44.691 --> 03:47.758
     but she couldn't help      
         taking things.         

03:47.760 --> 03:50.228
      Yeah, it was so sad.      

03:50.230 --> 03:54.132
        I remember once,        
    after she left our house,   

03:54.134 --> 03:55.867
    we couldn't eat a thing.    

03:55.869 --> 03:57.501
She made you feel               
that bad, huh?                  

03:57.503 --> 04:01.072
          No. She took          
all the knives and forks.       

04:02.942 --> 04:05.009
            Ma... Listen, Ma.   
            Listen.             

04:05.011 --> 04:06.311
    Just because                

04:06.313 --> 04:07.879
your Aunt Gertrude              
stole things                    

04:07.881 --> 04:09.280
doesn't mean                    
that you will.                  

04:09.282 --> 04:12.083
              Oh, yeah,         
              that sort of thing

04:12.085 --> 04:13.651
  runs in the family, Gloria,   

04:13.653 --> 04:15.954
         and I dreamed          
      about Aunt Gertrude       

04:15.956 --> 04:17.654
     just the other night.      

04:17.656 --> 04:20.423
Oh, I could see her clear as day
          in my dream.          

04:20.426 --> 04:22.393
        She was sneaking        
        out of the house        

04:22.395 --> 04:25.864
with my mother's sewing machine.

04:25.866 --> 04:29.000
    She was riding it           
        like a bicycle.         

04:29.002 --> 04:31.535
Look, Ma, why don't you         
just sit down over here         

04:31.537 --> 04:33.037
and tell us what happened,      
        all right?              

04:33.039 --> 04:34.672
Don't tell Archie               
nothing about this, please.     

04:34.674 --> 04:36.307
                     Don't worry
                     about it.  

04:36.309 --> 04:37.909
                    Don't.      
                    We won't.   

04:37.911 --> 04:39.344
    Hello, everybody!           

04:39.346 --> 04:40.945
    Hello and whoop-dee-do!     

04:40.947 --> 04:43.314
        Hi, Daddy.              

04:43.316 --> 04:45.950
Hold it. hold it. Before you say
another word to me, stand back. 

04:45.952 --> 04:48.619
        You are looking         
  at a cham-peen bowler here.   

04:48.621 --> 04:51.422
      Edith, the greatest       
 Saturday afternoon of my life  

04:51.424 --> 04:53.424
    down in the alley.          
    Oh, the pins were flying.   

04:53.426 --> 04:54.759
                Every time      
                I took the ball,

04:54.761 --> 04:56.094
                 come up to     
                 the line there,

04:56.096 --> 04:58.129
          some guys in the back 
          were yelling "timber."

04:58.131 --> 04:59.430
          Why? Because I bowled,

04:59.432 --> 05:01.432
         for the first time     
         in my life, a 227 game.

05:01.434 --> 05:03.034
                 What do you got
                 to say to that?

05:03.036 --> 05:04.702
I was arrested.

05:16.315 --> 05:17.315
                      Huh?      

05:19.451 --> 05:21.286
I was arrested.                 

05:22.454 --> 05:23.988
You was arrested... for what?   

05:23.990 --> 05:28.293
Oh... if I told you,            
you'd just get mad.             

05:28.295 --> 05:29.460
            I ain't gonna get--!

05:32.731 --> 05:35.366
          I ain't gonna get mad.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.068
        Tell me what            
        you was arrested for.   

05:37.070 --> 05:39.703
I don't know where to start.    

05:39.705 --> 05:42.473
            At the beginning,   
            Edith.              

05:42.475 --> 05:44.142
Well, all right.                

05:44.144 --> 05:48.679
This morning, after I finished  
sorting the laundry upstairs    

05:48.681 --> 05:51.983
I came downstairs               
to do the breakfast dishes      

05:51.985 --> 05:55.519
and then I decided...           
to go to Willington's           

05:55.521 --> 05:56.955
and buy you                     
some shirts,                    

05:56.957 --> 05:58.456
  All right, hold it, hold it.  

05:58.458 --> 06:00.124
     Forget the beginning.      

06:00.126 --> 06:01.125
     Just start at the end.     

06:04.729 --> 06:06.331
        I was arrested.         

06:10.535 --> 06:13.304
    Edith, you know, uh, uh,    
         I got the idea         

06:13.306 --> 06:15.840
    that you're in some kind    
 of goofy trouble or something. 

06:15.842 --> 06:16.907
     Now, how did it start?     

06:16.909 --> 06:18.676
Well, the trouble started       

06:18.678 --> 06:22.613
because our old apartment       
is on Union Street.             

06:22.615 --> 06:25.950
You remember the apartment      
that got so hot in the summer   

06:25.952 --> 06:30.355
and Arthur had to sleep         
out on the fire escape?         

06:30.357 --> 06:33.657
Arthur was our cat.             

06:33.659 --> 06:36.560
You didn't like                 
Arthur the cat very well,       

06:36.562 --> 06:37.728
did you, Archie?                

06:37.730 --> 06:42.400
 I hated his fish-eating guts.  

06:42.402 --> 06:43.901
     Get on with the story.     

06:43.903 --> 06:45.636
    Well,                       

06:45.638 --> 06:49.340
    the number 44 bus route     
      don't go to Bayside       

06:49.342 --> 06:51.275
but I told the old lady it did. 

06:55.047 --> 06:57.748
You told, uh, uh... Who? Who?   

06:57.750 --> 07:01.152
      The little old lady       
in Willington's department store

07:01.154 --> 07:02.887
    who wanted to go to Bayside.

07:02.889 --> 07:05.289
              I told her to take
              the number 44.    

07:06.225 --> 07:07.691
Wait a minute.                  

07:07.693 --> 07:09.693
You told an old lady            
something wrong,                

07:09.695 --> 07:11.396
but that ain't no crime.        

07:11.398 --> 07:12.830
What did they arrest you for?   

07:12.832 --> 07:14.798
  Because I was wearing the wig.

07:16.801 --> 07:18.669
Just a minute.                  
Sit down in the chair here.     

07:18.671 --> 07:20.638
         Daddy, Ma's very upset,
         so go easy.            

07:20.640 --> 07:22.240
Get away                        
from me, both--                 

07:22.242 --> 07:23.908
Don't tell me                   
how to go nothing.              

07:23.910 --> 07:26.511
Shut up, the two of youse.      
Sit down over here.             

07:26.513 --> 07:28.913
Just sit down quiet.            

07:28.915 --> 07:31.149
        I'll handle it.         

07:31.151 --> 07:34.385
    Once again, I got to        
    straighten out conditions   

07:34.387 --> 07:35.886
              here in Nutsville.

07:41.626 --> 07:44.128
          Edith, let me explain 
          something to you, huh?

07:44.130 --> 07:46.630
        You ain't got no wig.   

07:46.632 --> 07:50.568
I know, but I was trying one on 
down at Willington's,           

07:50.570 --> 07:53.737
and I was still wearing it      
when I ran out of the store     

07:53.739 --> 07:55.173
after the little old lady       

07:55.175 --> 07:57.608
to tell her                     
I told her the wrong bus,       

07:57.610 --> 07:59.310
and that's when they--          
                    Arrested you

07:59.312 --> 08:01.546
                for shoplifting.
                Holy cow!       

08:06.051 --> 08:07.885
                Did they call   
                the cops on you?

08:07.887 --> 08:10.020
No. No, they---                 

08:10.022 --> 08:13.891
They said I could never         
come in the store again,        

08:13.893 --> 08:16.394
and then they made me           
sign a form                     

08:16.396 --> 08:18.062
and they took my picture.       

08:18.064 --> 08:20.231
                      Oh, Jesus.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.732
        Ma, that means you're   
        on the blacklist.       

08:21.734 --> 08:22.900
                Oh, jeez,       
                a blacklist now.

08:22.902 --> 08:24.435
        What blacklist?         

08:24.437 --> 08:27.071
      The ones that the stores  
      pass around to each other.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.772
They pass them                  
all around, everywhere.         

08:28.774 --> 08:31.209
They feed those things          
into computers.                 

08:31.211 --> 08:32.409
                 Into computers.

08:32.412 --> 08:33.410
And once that happens,          

08:33.413 --> 08:34.479
your credit rating              
is zilch.                       

08:34.481 --> 08:35.913
        All because of this--   

08:35.914 --> 08:37.914
          What do you mean,     
          "credit rating zilch"?

08:37.917 --> 08:39.517
            I ain't gonna let   
            no store do that    

08:39.519 --> 08:41.419
         over one little mistake
         like this here.        

08:41.421 --> 08:44.888
    I know how to handle them   
    stores... believe me.       

08:44.890 --> 08:48.159
Now, that store is gonna        
make an apology to you          

08:48.161 --> 08:49.594
first thing                     
Monday morning.                 

08:49.596 --> 08:51.496
I'm gonna send you              
down there to get it.           

08:55.934 --> 08:58.302
  Oh, Archie, I can't do that.  

08:58.304 --> 09:00.938
They won't let me in the store. 

09:00.940 --> 09:03.508
      And everybody knows       
      I'm a klep-a-maniac.      

09:03.510 --> 09:04.375
Ah...                           

09:05.477 --> 09:08.712
 I'll never go shopping again.  

09:08.714 --> 09:10.548
     Stop crying, will you?     

09:10.550 --> 09:12.816
          What are you          
      making her crying for?    

09:12.818 --> 09:14.118
Let me handle this.             

09:14.120 --> 09:15.986
The two of youse                
get out of here.                

09:15.988 --> 09:17.622
I want to talk                  
to her alone.                   

09:17.624 --> 09:19.323
         All right, Michael,    
         let's make some coffee.

09:19.325 --> 09:20.891
Daddy, be nice.                 

09:20.893 --> 09:22.693
        Leave me alone.         

09:22.695 --> 09:24.662
Oh, Edith, come on,             
come on, will you?              

09:24.664 --> 09:26.197
Stop slobbering there.          

09:26.199 --> 09:27.365
I'm sorry.                      

09:27.367 --> 09:30.401
             Jeez, that ain't   
             gonna help nothing.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.236
                Oh... Oh, Edith,

09:32.238 --> 09:33.771
                 Edith, Edith,  
                 listen, listen.

09:33.773 --> 09:37.375
            It ain't your fault.
            It ain't your fault.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.877
          It's the world, Edith.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.612
What do you mean?               

09:41.614 --> 09:43.981
            I mean, Edith,      
            that the world...   

09:43.983 --> 09:47.885
                  just ain't    
                  ready for you.

09:47.887 --> 09:50.621
I don't understand.             

09:50.623 --> 09:53.524
        Well, what I'm trying   
        to say is that I know   

09:53.526 --> 09:55.726
      that you ain't never hurt 
      nobody in your whole life.

09:55.728 --> 09:57.261
                 You never told 
                 a lie to nobody

09:57.263 --> 09:58.429
            and I know damn well

09:58.431 --> 09:59.863
            you never stole     
            nothing from nobody.

09:59.865 --> 10:03.767
Do you really think so, Archie? 

10:03.769 --> 10:06.504
Oh, certainly, Edith, certainly.

10:06.506 --> 10:08.439
         The only thing         
anybody could ever pin on you,  

10:08.441 --> 10:10.441
     and so far as I know,      
      it ain't no crime,        

10:10.443 --> 10:11.609
      is being a dingbat.       

10:15.480 --> 10:20.184
Oh, thank you, Archie.          

10:20.186 --> 10:21.819
        Oh, all right, Edith.   

10:21.821 --> 10:22.986
        You want to thank me,   

10:22.988 --> 10:24.988
          just go and get some  
          of that coffee for me.

10:24.990 --> 10:26.924
All right, Archie,              
right away.                     

10:26.926 --> 10:28.693
Oh, my, I feel like             

10:28.695 --> 10:32.196
a weight's been lifted          
from my shoulders.              

10:32.198 --> 10:33.231
Ain't it silly                  

10:33.233 --> 10:36.834
how we let things               
bother us?                      

10:36.836 --> 10:40.338
          Oh, I'll take that cup
          of coffee for Archie. 

10:40.340 --> 10:41.372
     You look brighter, Ma.     

10:41.374 --> 10:43.441
                Oh, yeah. I feel
                much better now.

10:43.443 --> 10:46.143
                Archie knows how
                to talk to me.  

10:46.145 --> 10:49.280
Oh, Ma, you look prettier       
when you're smiling,            

10:49.282 --> 10:50.748
    and that's a pretty         
    necklace, too.              

10:50.750 --> 10:55.253
     Thanks. Here, Archie.      
      Here's your coffee.       

10:55.255 --> 10:56.454
         What necklace?         

11:02.628 --> 11:04.362
            Oh, my.             

11:04.364 --> 11:05.763
GLORIA: What's                  
the matter, Ma?                 

11:05.765 --> 11:11.802
  Oh, I-- I tried it on to see  
  how it looked with the wig,   

11:11.804 --> 11:14.505
    but I never paid for it!    

11:15.840 --> 11:18.108
        I am a klepper!         

11:18.110 --> 11:20.411
        [WAILING]               

11:26.452 --> 11:28.453
         Ma, come down          
    and have your breakfast.    

11:28.455 --> 11:30.354
You really should eat something.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.389
EDITH:                          
All right, Gloria.              

11:32.391 --> 11:34.725
            Michael,            
  I'm really worried about Ma.  

11:34.727 --> 11:36.561
She's been moping               
around all weekend.             

11:36.563 --> 11:38.162
  You know, I've been thinking  
    about it, Gloria,           

11:38.164 --> 11:40.631
 and I think we ought to talk Ma
 into seeing a psychiatrist.    

11:40.633 --> 11:42.967
        A psychiatrist?         

11:42.969 --> 11:46.136
         Oh, no, Mike.          
I can't go to one of them.      

11:46.138 --> 11:48.973
              Besides, I'm going
              someplace else.   

11:48.975 --> 11:51.208
Ma, why don't you let us        
make an appointment for you?    

11:51.210 --> 11:52.977
A psychiatrist would            
make you feel better.           

11:52.979 --> 11:54.445
        No. No, Gloria.         

11:54.447 --> 11:57.815
I won't have time, anyway.      
I'm going someplace else.       

11:57.817 --> 11:58.850
MIKE:                           
Where?                          

11:58.852 --> 11:59.851
        Somewhere.              

11:59.853 --> 12:01.552
     Hey! Who is the person     

12:01.554 --> 12:03.588
     that put the last roll     
        of toilet paper         

12:03.590 --> 12:04.755
     on the spool up there?     

12:07.359 --> 12:08.693
          I was. Why?           

12:08.695 --> 12:10.761
     I might've knew that.      

12:10.763 --> 12:12.630
         How many times         
    I got to tell you?          

12:12.632 --> 12:15.399
    The paper goes in           
over the spool, not under.      

12:18.604 --> 12:20.004
    Who cares?                  

12:20.006 --> 12:21.739
            I want to talk to   
            you about something.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.875
Come on! I got to eat           
and go to work.                 

12:23.877 --> 12:25.810
              Come on, will you?
              Just one second.  

12:25.812 --> 12:28.412
          I think Ma ought to go
          see a psychiatrist.   

12:28.414 --> 12:30.147
No dice to no psychiatrist!     

12:30.149 --> 12:31.181
                        Why not?

12:31.183 --> 12:32.517
Anybody goes to see             
a psychiatrist                  

12:32.519 --> 12:33.818
ought to have                   
his head examined.              

12:35.286 --> 12:36.787
All right, Daddy,               

12:36.789 --> 12:38.355
have you got                    
a better suggestion?            

12:38.357 --> 12:39.590
            After work today,   

12:39.592 --> 12:41.158
         I'm going down         
to that Willington store.       

12:41.160 --> 12:42.660
        I'm gonna see           
      that manager myself       

12:42.662 --> 12:44.695
         and I am gonna         
        put the fix in.         

12:44.697 --> 12:46.296
     Now, look at the time.     
    You're keeping me.          

12:46.298 --> 12:47.698
                 I'm gonna be   
                 late for work. 

12:47.700 --> 12:49.099
              Will you get      
              my lunch box, huh?

12:49.101 --> 12:50.902
          To top it off, the    
          radio says rain today.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.269
Get away from me.               

12:52.271 --> 12:54.104
             You know what that 
             does to the subway?

12:54.106 --> 12:55.907
         It makes the damn thing
         like a Turkish bath.   

12:55.909 --> 12:57.708
        You better take         
    your rubbers too.           

12:57.710 --> 12:59.010
                    I don't want
                    no rubbers. 

12:59.012 --> 13:00.578
                 Every time     
                 I pull them off

13:00.580 --> 13:02.847
                  my shoes come 
                  off with them.

13:02.849 --> 13:05.115
                Give me that.   

13:05.117 --> 13:07.685
             Oh...              

13:07.687 --> 13:09.654
        Oh, well, now, I ain't  
        gonna carry that, Edith.

13:09.656 --> 13:12.657
    The guys at the loading dock
    see me walking in with that,

13:12.659 --> 13:16.126
          they'd think I turned 
          into an English fruit.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.262
It's Louise Jefferson's.        

13:18.264 --> 13:19.931
             I don't care if    
             it's Mary Poppins'.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.966
             Let me out of here.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.367
GLORIA: You have                
a nice day, Daddy.              

13:23.369 --> 13:24.635
             How the hell can I?

13:26.772 --> 13:28.539
        Oh, dear.               

13:28.541 --> 13:30.575
Ma, what's with                 
the umbrella?                   

13:30.577 --> 13:33.477
Well, I borrowed it             
from Louise a week ago,         

13:33.479 --> 13:36.313
and yesterday                   
she asked for it back           

13:36.315 --> 13:38.182
and I told her                  
I didn't have it.               

13:38.184 --> 13:41.118
        I told her              
 I already gave it back to her. 

13:41.120 --> 13:43.120
Well, that's an easy            
mistake to make.                

13:43.122 --> 13:49.093
 But, Gloria, suppose I didn't  
    give it back on purpose.    

13:49.095 --> 13:51.596
             Ma, look how you're
             torturing yourself.

13:51.598 --> 13:55.032
Yeah. I got to go see somebody. 

13:55.034 --> 13:56.033
                That's right.   

13:56.035 --> 13:57.367
            Now forget          
            what Archie says.   

13:57.369 --> 13:59.103
            You got to go see   
            a psychiatrist      

13:59.105 --> 14:00.905
        and I think you         
        ought to do it today.   

14:00.907 --> 14:03.507
  It was my son-in-law's idea   

14:03.509 --> 14:05.643
    that I should see           
        a psychiatrist.         

14:05.645 --> 14:08.345
     He said I should talk      
    to somebody professional    

14:08.347 --> 14:09.814
        and he's right.         

14:09.816 --> 14:12.116
 That's why I came to see you.  

14:12.118 --> 14:13.250
            Well, I'm very      
            flattered, but...   

14:13.252 --> 14:14.952
            why me?             

14:16.354 --> 14:19.657
Father,                         
you don't mind                  

14:19.659 --> 14:21.558
if I ain't Catholic,            
do you?                         

14:21.560 --> 14:22.559
             No, no, no, no, no.

14:22.561 --> 14:23.828
                I have a sinking
                feeling         

14:23.830 --> 14:25.262
             a lot of my        
             congregation isn't.

14:30.769 --> 14:31.936
    Really?                     

14:31.938 --> 14:34.705
  No, no. Protestant ministers  
         say that too.          

14:34.707 --> 14:36.707
  It's a religious joke. Ugh.   

14:38.409 --> 14:40.044
        Oh, yeah.               

14:43.815 --> 14:45.850
    I thought of going          
         to our pastor,         

14:45.852 --> 14:47.351
     the Reverend Felcher,      

14:47.353 --> 14:49.353
     but I was too ashamed,     

14:49.355 --> 14:51.122
and I heard in your church      

14:51.124 --> 14:52.890
 you don't talk about nothing.  

14:52.892 --> 14:54.424
              No?               

14:56.628 --> 14:59.063
      I mean about nothing      
          you're told.          

14:59.065 --> 15:01.265
      Oh, oh. The secrets       
         of confession.         

15:01.267 --> 15:03.500
    Yes, that's the hardest     
    part of the job for me.     

15:03.502 --> 15:06.503
    I'm a born gossip.          

15:06.505 --> 15:09.473
     Don't worry. We never talk.

15:09.475 --> 15:12.309
      Now, let's get back       
to our discussion, Mrs. Bunker. 

15:12.311 --> 15:13.644
Well, I remembered              

15:13.646 --> 15:17.381
     how nice you was to us     
     when I dented your car     

15:17.383 --> 15:20.951
  with a can of cling peaches   
        in heavy syrup.         

15:20.953 --> 15:23.253
        Remember,               
  it was at Ferguson's market?  

15:23.255 --> 15:26.090
They were having a special on-- 

15:26.092 --> 15:27.591
             Oh, why'd you stop?

15:27.593 --> 15:31.428
          That's where          
  Archie usually says "stifle." 

15:31.430 --> 15:34.732
 Ah, yes, your husband, Archie. 

15:34.734 --> 15:36.767
     You know, Mrs. Bunker,     
     all things considered      

15:36.769 --> 15:40.104
      you're a remarkably       
        cheerful woman.         

15:41.439 --> 15:44.608
Well, I ain't so cheerful       
        no more, Father.        

15:44.610 --> 15:47.111
  That's why I need your help.  

15:47.113 --> 15:50.547
          I don't want          
     to be a klep-a-maniac.     

15:50.549 --> 15:51.782
             Well, now, I'm sure
             you aren't.        

15:51.784 --> 15:52.950
                 If you were    
                 a kleptomaniac,

15:52.952 --> 15:55.652
        you wouldn't be as upset
        as you are about it.    

15:55.654 --> 15:58.522
But what about                  
the Eighth Commandment?         

15:58.524 --> 16:00.758
        Oh, um... uh...         

16:00.760 --> 16:02.793
             Uh...              

16:04.730 --> 16:06.563
    "Thou shalt not steal."     

16:06.565 --> 16:07.664
                         Oh! Oh!

16:14.572 --> 16:16.073
I'm sure, I'm sure, Mrs. Bunker,

16:16.075 --> 16:17.742
      that you exaggerate       
     when you say "stole."      

16:17.744 --> 16:19.676
      Now, now, you really      
  don't believe that, do you?   

16:19.678 --> 16:23.114
Oh, I don't know                
what to believe no more,        

16:23.116 --> 16:26.450
and, uh, I think                
I broke number 10 too.          

16:26.452 --> 16:27.718
      Oh, number 10, huh?       

16:27.720 --> 16:29.486
    Hmm. How'd you do that?     

16:29.488 --> 16:32.189
I coveted                       
my neighbor's umbrella.         

16:36.494 --> 16:40.697
Father, can you tell me         
why I'm doing these things?     

16:40.699 --> 16:42.733
        Well, of course         
    I'm not a psychiatrist,     

16:42.735 --> 16:45.335
 but I do know that kleptomania 
     isn't really criminal.     

16:45.337 --> 16:47.938
It's more of an emotional upset.

16:47.940 --> 16:50.107
             Now, uh... perhaps 
             you're dissatisfied

16:50.109 --> 16:51.642
                 with your life.

16:51.644 --> 16:52.743
Oh, no.                         

16:52.745 --> 16:54.311
             You ever wish you  
             were somebody else?

16:54.313 --> 16:55.712
              No,               

16:55.714 --> 16:57.314
  but when I was a little girl  

16:57.316 --> 17:00.317
    I used to pretend           
      to be somebody else.      

17:00.319 --> 17:01.518
                  Oh, yeah? Who?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.387
    Deanna Durbin.              

17:04.390 --> 17:05.856
         ♪ Da-ta-ta ♪           

17:05.858 --> 17:09.459
         ♪ Da-da-da ♪           

17:09.461 --> 17:11.162
             BOTH:              
             ♪ Da ♪             

17:14.598 --> 17:17.567
    My mother used to think     
          I was crazy,          

17:17.569 --> 17:19.103
     daydreaming that way.      

17:19.105 --> 17:21.271
     There's nothing crazy      
    about daydreaming.          

17:21.273 --> 17:22.571
     I do it all the time.      

17:22.574 --> 17:24.675
    Priests daydream?           

17:24.676 --> 17:26.076
        Oh, sure, sure.         

17:26.078 --> 17:29.079
        Some of us dream        
of being bishops and cardinals. 

17:29.081 --> 17:31.715
 Cardinals dream of being pope. 

17:31.717 --> 17:33.550
    What do you dream about?    

17:33.552 --> 17:35.152
    I dream about retiring.     

17:37.722 --> 17:39.256
        You still think         
about being other people?       

17:39.258 --> 17:41.158
          Oh, no. No.           

17:41.160 --> 17:45.329
I just think about other people 
doing the same things I'm doing.

17:45.331 --> 17:48.098
Like, when I'm brushing my teeth

17:48.100 --> 17:51.235
        I stop and think        
     about Elizabeth Taylor     

17:51.237 --> 17:53.804
    or the Queen of England     

17:53.806 --> 17:58.075
      brushing their teeth      
     at the very same time.     

17:58.077 --> 17:59.376
    Well, everybody does it.    

17:59.378 --> 18:03.147
     If they've got teeth.      

18:03.149 --> 18:06.350
     You know, I can think      
      of Elizabeth Taylor       

18:06.352 --> 18:08.085
    brushing her teeth,         

18:08.087 --> 18:12.289
     but I can never think      
    of her spitting it out.     

18:19.664 --> 18:21.698
    Well, Mrs. Bunker,          
you seem very relaxed now.      

18:21.700 --> 18:22.733
Oh, yeah.                       

18:22.735 --> 18:24.101
 Well, suppose, then, we go on  

18:24.103 --> 18:26.703
            with that--         
            That story of yours.

18:26.705 --> 18:28.538
                  Now, uh, now, 
                  you think, uh,

18:28.540 --> 18:30.174
                 you think very 
                 hard this time.

18:30.176 --> 18:33.810
        Now, the little old lady
        wanted to go to Bayside.

18:33.812 --> 18:34.945
Yeah.                           

18:34.947 --> 18:38.015
That's what I heard             
her tell the floorwalker        

18:38.017 --> 18:39.483
and I thought                   
I knew...                       

18:39.485 --> 18:41.151
                    Now, now,   
                    now, now,   

18:41.153 --> 18:42.152
                The floorwalker?

18:42.154 --> 18:44.154
Yeah, Mr. Masterson.            

18:44.156 --> 18:45.822
So I went over                  

18:45.824 --> 18:48.492
and I told her to take          
the number 44--                 

18:48.494 --> 18:50.527
              Now, Mr. Masterson
              was there?        

18:50.529 --> 18:53.764
Yeah. He's been with            
Willington's for years.         

18:53.766 --> 18:55.465
And then she said,              
"Thank you very much."          

18:55.467 --> 18:57.834
      Mr. Masterson's a witness.

18:57.836 --> 19:01.005
    No, he's a floorwalker.     

19:01.007 --> 19:04.474
And then I went back            
to trying on the wig--          

19:04.476 --> 19:05.509
            Now, Mrs., Mrs.--   

19:05.511 --> 19:08.045
Wait. Father,                   
I ain't finished yet.           

19:08.047 --> 19:10.447
  I was looking in the mirror,  

19:10.449 --> 19:12.917
    and I was thinking          
         about the bus,         

19:12.919 --> 19:16.653
        and I saw myself        
        looking puzzled,        

19:16.655 --> 19:20.824
  and I ran out in the street   
            after...            

19:25.696 --> 19:29.133
     I didn't take the wig      
          on purpose.           

19:29.135 --> 19:30.367
  Well, of course you didn't,   

19:30.369 --> 19:31.768
    and Mr. Masterson           
        knows that too.         

19:31.770 --> 19:35.806
         That's right!          
      I forgot about him.       

19:35.808 --> 19:37.408
        Of course,              
and the shock of being arrested 

19:37.410 --> 19:38.875
        drove him               
    right out of your mind.     

19:38.877 --> 19:42.712
     But he's in here now.      

19:42.714 --> 19:47.217
    He saw me talking           
    to the little old lady.     

19:47.219 --> 19:52.256
    He knows why I ran          
  out of the store after her.   

19:52.258 --> 19:57.428
He knows I didn't steal the wig.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.897
    I ain't a klepper!          

20:00.899 --> 20:03.233
Oh, Father!                     

20:13.378 --> 20:15.946
What I mean, Mr. Kirkwood,      
     is that my wife Edith      

20:15.948 --> 20:17.747
never stole nothing             
in her whole life.              

20:17.749 --> 20:20.117
I'm sure this whole thing       
was some kind of mistake.       

20:20.119 --> 20:24.188
    Not according to the        
    store detective's report.   

20:24.190 --> 20:25.722
          I'm sorry, Mr. Bunker,

20:25.724 --> 20:27.891
        but I'm afraid that's   
        what they all say       

20:27.893 --> 20:28.993
             once we catch them.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.494
             "It was a mistake."

20:30.496 --> 20:32.863
        Well, I-- I know        
     it looks bad for Edith     

20:32.865 --> 20:35.565
but couldn't you kind of,       

20:35.567 --> 20:38.402
      you know, square it       
for one of your own kind?       

20:38.404 --> 20:39.970
You know                        
what I mean?                    

20:39.972 --> 20:43.807
 I'm not, uh, not exactly sure  
 I get your drift, Mr. Bunker.  

20:43.809 --> 20:46.610
     What does that mean,       
    "one of your own kind"?     

20:46.612 --> 20:51.781
Well, you know, people like us. 
You, me, my wife and all.       

20:51.783 --> 20:54.118
You know, we like to come       
shopping here at Willington's.  

20:54.120 --> 20:56.286
We don't like to go             
to them other places            

20:56.288 --> 20:59.256
like Bloomingdale's, Klein's,   
Abraham and Strauss.            

20:59.258 --> 21:01.091
You know that tribe?            

21:01.093 --> 21:04.094
 Oh, yeah. I'm beginning to see 
         what you mean.         

21:04.096 --> 21:05.496
          Sure you do.          

21:05.498 --> 21:07.998
  I mean, I knew by your face   
  and by your name, Kirkwood,   

21:08.000 --> 21:09.566
    you'd see my point here.    

21:09.568 --> 21:12.669
 Now, listen, you want to keep  
    customers like us           

21:12.671 --> 21:14.004
     who enjoy coming here      

21:14.006 --> 21:16.140
    because they know           
  they get a fair shake here.   

21:16.142 --> 21:17.607
I mean,                         
get the picture?                

21:17.609 --> 21:19.709
      Oh, oh, yeah, I do.       

21:19.711 --> 21:22.179
        I get it.               

21:22.181 --> 21:26.116
    Oh, uh, here's a picture    
of my family, Mr. Bunker.       

21:26.118 --> 21:29.319
        There's my wife         
and my daughter, Melanie.       

21:31.089 --> 21:32.189
Nice-looking family.            

21:32.191 --> 21:33.223
                      Thank you.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.759
                 My wife's first
                 name is Janet. 

21:35.761 --> 21:37.227
That's a nice name              
for a wife.                     

21:37.229 --> 21:41.831
     Before we were married     
 her name was Janet Goldstein.  

21:52.177 --> 21:53.577
        Goldstein.              

21:53.579 --> 21:56.547
     Yeah. So why don't you     
    just take yourself          

21:56.549 --> 21:58.248
     and your anti-Semitism     

21:58.250 --> 21:59.783
the hell out of here, huh?      

21:59.785 --> 22:01.017
     All right. All right.      

22:01.019 --> 22:03.120
         I'm gonna tell you     
         something else, Bunker.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.288
                  My wife Janet,

22:04.290 --> 22:06.123
        she's got a word        
        for people like you.    

22:06.125 --> 22:08.758
        A word that describes   
        you perfectly.          

22:08.760 --> 22:10.327
         You are a <i>narrishekopf.</i>

22:12.029 --> 22:15.232
What the hell is that?          
                     A meathead.

22:24.175 --> 22:25.809
Oh, well.                       

22:25.811 --> 22:28.678
You never know who you're       
talking to no more.             

22:32.183 --> 22:36.587
    Oh, thank you very much,    
         Mr. Kirkwood.          

22:36.589 --> 22:38.122
        Yeah, bye.              

22:38.124 --> 22:40.790
     That was Mr. Kirkwood,     
          the manager.          

22:40.792 --> 22:42.993
                Mr. Masterson   
                spoke to him    

22:42.995 --> 22:44.961
                     and my name
                     is cleared.

22:44.963 --> 22:46.463
            Oh, Ma,             
    that's wonderful.           

22:46.465 --> 22:47.864
Great, Ma.                      
Great.                          

22:47.866 --> 22:51.468
        He says I'm welcome     
        in the store anytime,   

22:51.470 --> 22:53.537
      but for some reason       

22:53.539 --> 22:56.273
     he said he didn't want     
to see Archie down there.       

22:59.344 --> 23:00.877
Archie!                         

23:00.879 --> 23:03.980
         Hello!                 

23:03.982 --> 23:06.116
How was your day?               

23:06.118 --> 23:07.618
Just like any other day, Edith. 

23:07.620 --> 23:09.486
 I don't want to talk about it. 

23:10.988 --> 23:12.589
        Tell you something else.
        I was into Willington's,

23:12.591 --> 23:14.458
    I seen that manager         
    and we're quits with him.   

23:14.460 --> 23:15.659
    You ought to be damn glad   

23:15.661 --> 23:17.528
          you don't have to shop
          in there no more.     

23:17.530 --> 23:19.630
                But, Archie--   
  You want to do any shopping,  

23:19.632 --> 23:21.465
there's millions of other places
          you can go.           

23:21.467 --> 23:25.001
         Go to Klein's,         
 Abraham and Strauss, anything. 

23:25.003 --> 23:27.871
                Archie, he      
                cleared my name.

23:27.873 --> 23:30.307
        I don't care...         

23:30.309 --> 23:32.742
     I'm off the blacklist.     

23:36.414 --> 23:37.548
      Well, maybe the guy       

23:37.550 --> 23:40.484
         thought twice          
     about what I told him.     

23:40.486 --> 23:42.452
What did you                    
tell him, Arch?                 

23:42.454 --> 23:44.120
    What do you care?           

23:44.122 --> 23:45.989
Do you have to know everything? 

23:45.991 --> 23:47.424
  Take him away and feed him.   

23:47.426 --> 23:48.292
              Huh?              

23:50.395 --> 23:52.062
        Him and all his         
         psychiatrists.         

23:52.064 --> 23:54.298
      He'd have everybody       
running to a psychiatrist.      

23:54.300 --> 23:56.333
    I bet you're glad           
      you didn't go there.      

23:56.335 --> 23:59.436
Oh, yeah, Archie, I'm very glad.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.239
      I want to tell you,       
if youse all had listened to me 

24:02.241 --> 24:04.474
    a little bit more often     
          around here,          

24:04.476 --> 24:07.678
        life would go on        
    much more simpler.          

24:16.387 --> 24:18.822
                  What do you   
                  think, Gloria?

24:18.824 --> 24:20.257
Looks great                     
with your dress.                

24:20.259 --> 24:21.725
Really suits                    
you, Ma.                        

24:21.727 --> 24:22.859
                Edith, Edith,   

24:22.861 --> 24:24.261
          what are you doing    
          wearing that necklace?

24:24.263 --> 24:26.062
         You're supposed to give
         that back to the store!

24:26.064 --> 24:27.698
No. It's all right, Archie.     

24:27.700 --> 24:32.603
Mr. Kirkwood, the store manager,
said I could keep it.           

24:32.605 --> 24:34.170
                      Oh.       

24:34.172 --> 24:36.573
            Well, after all     
            the trouble he made,

24:36.575 --> 24:38.575
     the least he could do      
     is give you something.     

24:38.577 --> 24:40.444
And not only that.              

24:40.446 --> 24:42.879
He says it's gonna              
be the first item               

24:42.881 --> 24:45.449
on my new                       
charge account.
