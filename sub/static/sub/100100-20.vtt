WEBVTT

00:02.132 --> 00:04.221
PREVIOUSLY ON "BATWOMAN"...

00:04.265 --> 00:06.049
TOMMY SAID THAT THIS BOOK

00:06.093 --> 00:08.791
HOLDS THE KEY
TO KILLING BATWOMAN,

00:08.834 --> 00:12.186
AND I WANT HER
VERY, VERY DEAD.

00:12.229 --> 00:16.320
MOUSE: LUCIUS FOX WROTE
THE ENTIRE JOURNAL IN CODE!

00:16.364 --> 00:18.235
JULIA: YOU DID IT!
YOU KNOW WHAT IT SAYS?

00:18.279 --> 00:20.063
WHY AREN'T YOU
HAPPIER ABOUT THIS?

00:20.107 --> 00:22.892
LUKE: THE BOOK CONTAINS
THE SECRET TO KILLING YOU.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.763
THESE ARE LUCIUS FOX'S
GLASSES.

00:24.807 --> 00:27.070
THEY UNLOCK THE CODE.
LET LUKE AND JULIA GO,

00:27.114 --> 00:28.767
AND THEY'RE YOURS.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.291
ALICE: GO BRING ME
TOMMY SO HE CAN TELL ME

00:30.334 --> 00:34.817
WHERE TO FIND
A LITTLE GREEN ROCK

00:34.860 --> 00:36.645
CALLED KRYPTONITE.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.386
-I HAVE TO DO THIS.
-I HAVE TO STOP YOU.

00:38.429 --> 00:39.909
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.302
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

00:41.345 --> 00:43.086
KARA: KRYPTONITE.
WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT?

00:43.130 --> 00:44.435
IT WAS BRUCE WAYNE'S.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.089
HE LOST HOPE.
I NEVER WILL.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.786
KEEP IT,
AND I HAVE THE COURAGE

00:47.830 --> 00:50.441
THAT YOU'LL NEVER
HAVE TO USE IT.

00:50.485 --> 00:53.096
MAN: BATWOMAN'S
IN CELL BLOCK D.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.793
NO. PLEASE. DON'T.

00:59.233 --> 01:01.278
JACOB: PSYCHOTIC ESCAPEES
ARE ALL OVER THIS CITY

01:01.322 --> 01:03.063
RIGHT NOW THANKS TO YOU.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.542
LET THIS SERVE
AS YOUR WARNING.

01:04.586 --> 01:07.067
IF I SEE YOU AGAIN,
IT'S WAR.

01:30.612 --> 01:32.483
WOMAN, ON P.A.: THIS IS
THE BURNLEY LINE

01:32.527 --> 01:36.531
BOUND FOR CENTRAL GOTHAM.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.673
MAN: HEY, HEY!

01:48.717 --> 01:50.849
WOMAN: HURRY, HURRY.
DIFFERENT WOMAN: GO!

01:50.893 --> 01:52.199
AAH!

01:57.682 --> 02:00.294
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!
OUT OF THE WAY!

02:03.993 --> 02:05.516
JACOB: BACK, BACK, BACK!
GET AWAY FROM THE TRAIN!

02:05.560 --> 02:07.518
GET AWAY
FROM THE TRAIN!

02:07.562 --> 02:09.390
DROP THE KNIVES!

02:13.089 --> 02:14.221
HYAH!

02:15.961 --> 02:18.703
WHY? SO YOU CAN SEND
ME BACK THERE?

02:30.933 --> 02:32.543
AAH!

02:40.638 --> 02:42.379
THESE ARE
INNOCENT PEOPLE!

02:42.423 --> 02:44.816
I DON'T CARE!

02:44.860 --> 02:47.254
AAH! AAH! AAH!

02:47.297 --> 02:48.951
RAAH!

02:52.520 --> 02:54.043
ERR!

02:58.090 --> 02:59.918
OHH.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.746
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO STAY IN THE CAR.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.748
WHO THE HELL
WAS THAT?

03:03.792 --> 03:05.446
I HAVE NO IDEA.

03:13.410 --> 03:16.326
VESPER: RUMOR HAS IT,
THE MACHETE-WIELDING MANIAC

03:16.370 --> 03:20.287
WAS ARKHAM ESCAPEE
AND COLLEGE FOOTBALL PHENOM

03:20.330 --> 03:22.027
TIM "THE TITAN" TESLOW.

03:22.071 --> 03:23.855
SINCE APPARENTLY
THE CROWS COMMANDER

03:23.899 --> 03:27.163
COULDN'T TAKE DOWN
THIS HULKING GOTHAM GOLIATHS

03:27.207 --> 03:29.209
TIGHT END
WITH A 12-GAUGE,

03:29.252 --> 03:31.254
LET'S HOPE BATWOMAN
HAS A SLINGSHOT

03:31.298 --> 03:33.300
IN HER BATBELT.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.531
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

03:47.575 --> 03:49.577
THE CROWS HAVE
AN APP NOW.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.274
DARLING, MY LIGHT.

03:51.318 --> 03:54.016
IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO SEE
OUT OF LUCIUS FOX'S GLASSES.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.365
YOU JUST PUSH
THE BUTTON,

03:55.409 --> 03:57.367
AND THE ANTS COME
MARCHING IN.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.282
ANYONE WITH A PHONE
CAN USE IT,

03:59.326 --> 04:01.545
CLIENT OR NOT,
WHICH MEANS ANYONE
WITH A PHONE

04:01.589 --> 04:05.723
CAN TURN US OVER
WITH THE CLICK
OF A SCREEN.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.986
WE GOT TO GET OUT
OF GOTHAM, ALICE.

04:13.557 --> 04:14.906
WHAT IS THAT?

04:14.950 --> 04:17.300
AAH! OHH!

04:17.344 --> 04:18.867
OOH, THE BATS!

04:18.910 --> 04:20.912
WHAT IS HAPPENING?
WHY ARE THEY HERE?

04:20.956 --> 04:23.654
BECAUSE BATS EAT
RATS, ALICE,

04:23.698 --> 04:25.569
AND THAT'S WHAT
WE ARE DOWN HERE.

04:25.613 --> 04:29.269
WE ARE RATS LIVING
AMONG RATS.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.793
YOU PROMISED ME
THAT WE WOULD START
A NEW LIFE TOGETHER

04:31.836 --> 04:33.664
OUTSIDE OF ALL THIS,

04:33.708 --> 04:37.538
BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT
IF THE CROWS FIND US

04:37.581 --> 04:39.279
AND KILL US.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.414
HOW IS ONE SUPPOSED
TO START ANEW

04:44.458 --> 04:46.808
WHEN ALL THAT IS OLD
STILL HAUNTS HER?

04:46.851 --> 04:49.419
IS THAT THE ALICE
YOU WANT TO FROLIC BESIDE

04:49.463 --> 04:51.334
IN OUR WONDERLAND,

04:51.378 --> 04:55.164
OR DO YOU WISH YOUR ALICE
TO BE FULL AND COMPLETE

04:55.207 --> 04:58.123
AND HAPPY, HMM?

04:58.167 --> 05:01.170
YOU KNOW THAT'S
WHAT I WANT.

05:01.213 --> 05:03.868
THEN PATIENCE
UNTIL I CAN FIGURE OUT

05:03.912 --> 05:07.219
WHERE TO FIND THIS ROCK
THAT PENETRATES THE BATSUIT,

05:07.263 --> 05:11.136
A HIDING SPOT LUCIUS FOX
FORGOT TO MENTION
IN HIS JOURNAL.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.660
TOMMY: ALICE!

05:12.703 --> 05:16.011
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

05:16.054 --> 05:18.840
YOU CALL THIS,
THIS A FACE?!

05:18.883 --> 05:20.537
-REALLY, THIS?!
-HA HA HA!

05:25.281 --> 05:26.761
I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.635
I GOT YOU THE JOURNAL,

05:31.679 --> 05:33.550
I HELPED YOU DECODE IT,

05:33.594 --> 05:37.162
BECAUSE OF ME YOU
KNOW HOW TO KILL
YOUR SISTER BATWOMAN.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.512
THAT'S TRUE.

05:38.555 --> 05:40.078
BUT I AM NOT ABOUT
TO SPEND THE REST

05:40.122 --> 05:41.906
OF MY LIFE LOOKING LIKE
THE BASTARD

05:41.950 --> 05:45.345
THAT COULDN'T GET THE RODS
IN THE NUCLEAR REACTOR
IN TIME!

05:46.737 --> 05:49.261
GIVE ME A FACE
I CAN WEAR!

05:49.305 --> 05:51.916
MOUSE: HA HA HA!
THAT'S GOOD.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.441
SHOOT HER DEAD.
THAT'LL GET YOU YOUR FACE,

05:54.484 --> 05:55.920
YOU STUPID IDIOT.

05:55.964 --> 05:58.793
IT'S QUITE
ALL RIGHT, MOUSE.

05:58.836 --> 06:00.751
I CAN TAKE A NOTE.

06:00.795 --> 06:03.885
MOUSE: WAIT. WHAT?

06:03.928 --> 06:07.410
NO. YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY
BE LISTENING TO HIM.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.369
ALICE: I OWE HIM A FACE,
WHICH MEANS

06:09.412 --> 06:10.979
I'LL NEED TO GO
TO THE UNIVERSITY MORGUE

06:11.022 --> 06:12.633
FOR BETTER MATERIALS--

06:12.676 --> 06:16.158
SKIN, THREADS, SCALPELS,
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.681
BACK SOON.

06:17.725 --> 06:19.074
ALICE!

06:24.209 --> 06:28.300
YOU ARE HOLDING THE ONLY
SHARD OF KRYPTONITE
ON THE PLANET.

06:28.344 --> 06:30.433
WHY WAS THIS
IN A PUDDLE
IN THE BATCAVE?

06:30.477 --> 06:34.437
SAFEKEEPING.
BRUCE WAS HOLDING ONTO IT

06:34.481 --> 06:36.178
FOR A FRIEND.

06:36.221 --> 06:38.833
LET ME GUESS--
TIGHTS, CAPE,

06:38.876 --> 06:41.226
BIG "S"
ON HIS CHEST.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.403
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

06:43.446 --> 06:45.709
LUCKY GUESS.

06:45.753 --> 06:48.233
SO WHY FISH IT OUT
OF A PERFECTLY GOOD
HIDING SPACE?

06:48.277 --> 06:50.235
WELL, ALICE KNOWS THAT
THIS CAN PENETRATE
THE BATSUIT

06:50.279 --> 06:53.064
ALONG WITH WHATEVER ELSE
MY DAD WROTE ABOUT IT
IN HIS JOURNAL.

06:53.108 --> 06:55.153
HAMILTON'S COIL ACCELERATOR
IS DEFUNCT,

06:55.197 --> 06:56.981
YOU MELTED DOWN
BRUCE'S RAIL GUN,

06:57.025 --> 06:59.462
AND ONCE I FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DESTROY THIS,

06:59.506 --> 07:01.638
BATWOMAN IS AS GOOD
AS INVINCIBLE.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.949
UNLESS YOU KNOW
SOMETHING I DON'T.

07:07.992 --> 07:11.779
NOPE. GO TO TOWN.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.389
OK.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.478
HEY. I THOUGHT WE WERE
BATHUDDLING

07:15.522 --> 07:17.349
OVER THIS TITAN TESLOW
PSYCHO.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.003
BATHUDDLING
ISN'T A THING,

07:19.047 --> 07:21.745
AND I'M OFF TO DESTROY
AN ALIEN MINERAL.

07:21.789 --> 07:24.052
UH...HUH.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.358
JUST ANOTHER DAY
ON THE BATTEAM?

07:26.402 --> 07:27.838
PRETTY MUCH.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.840
SO TIM "THE TITAN" TESLOW,

07:29.884 --> 07:32.452
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW
THE BASICS, RIGHT?

07:32.495 --> 07:34.323
JUST REMIND ME AGAIN.

07:34.366 --> 07:37.979
HE WAS PRETTY MUCH
THE GOLIATHS' BEST
TIGHT END OF ALL TIME.

07:38.022 --> 07:40.547
A TD EVERY GAME,
OVER 100 CATCHES

07:40.590 --> 07:42.766
AND 1,000 YARDS
EVERY SEASON.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.507
LET'S NOT ASSUME
I KNOW WHAT ANY
OF THOSE WORDS MEAN

07:44.551 --> 07:46.509
BECAUSE I'M A LESBIAN.

07:46.553 --> 07:50.513
UH. HE WAS REALLY,
REALLY GOOD AND BRUTAL,

07:50.557 --> 07:53.124
AS IN GLADIATORESQUE.

07:53.168 --> 07:56.127
TURNS OUT THERE'S
A NOT-SO-SECRET SECRET
TO ALL OF HIS SUCCESS.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.086
SAY IT WITH ME--
STEROIDS!

07:58.129 --> 08:01.742
SEXY CHEERLEADERS!

08:01.785 --> 08:03.744
POINT BEING IT ALL CAME
TO A HEAD

08:03.787 --> 08:05.876
DURING A PLAYOFF GAME
AGAINST THE COUGARS.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.487
TITAN DIDN'T LIKE A CALL

08:07.530 --> 08:11.491
AND WENT STRAIGHT-UP
MORTAL KOMBAT FINISHING MOVE

08:11.534 --> 08:13.057
AGAINST THE OFFICIAL.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.624
HE SNAPPED HIS NECK
ON THE FIELD

08:14.668 --> 08:17.279
IN FRONT OF A STADIUM
FULL OF PEOPLE.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.629
OOF.

08:19.673 --> 08:22.371
SINCE WHEN DID YOU
BECOME A GOLIATHS FAN?

08:22.414 --> 08:26.636
SINCE TITAN'S BROTHER
APOLLO STARTED DATING
SELU COROVA.

08:26.680 --> 08:30.422
APOLLO'S THE GOLIATHS'
RUNNING BACK.

08:30.466 --> 08:33.817
YOU SERIOUSLY NEED TO GET
OUT OF THAT BATCAVE.

08:33.861 --> 08:36.559
I SERIOUSLY NEED TO
SUIT UP AND TALK
TO THIS BROTHER.

08:36.603 --> 08:37.995
MIGHT KNOW TITAN'S
WHEREABOUTS.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.650
ARE WE SURE THAT'S
THE BEST IDEA?

08:40.694 --> 08:42.652
I DO, MISS "BATWOMAN
DOESN'T GET A SICK DAY."

08:42.696 --> 08:45.394
I SAID THAT BEFORE
COMMANDER KANE PROMISED

08:45.437 --> 08:48.615
IF HE EVER SAW BATWOMAN
AGAIN IT'D BE WAR.

08:48.658 --> 08:53.141
I FEEL LIKE GOTHAM'S
GOT ENOUGH GREEK TRAGEDY
HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT.

08:53.184 --> 08:55.622
YOU DON'T KNOW MY DAD
LIKE I DO.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.841
I DO, THOUGH,

08:57.885 --> 09:01.236
BECAUSE HE'S MY DAD, TOO.

09:01.279 --> 09:03.020
NOT WHAT I MEANT.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.545
JUST I KNOW HOW HE GETS,
AND I KNOW WAYS

09:05.588 --> 09:07.198
OF GETTING AROUND HIM.

09:07.242 --> 09:10.201
LIKE WHEN TEENAGE KATE
WANTED A CROWS SUV,

09:10.245 --> 09:11.681
HE SAID NO,
YOU TOOK ONE ANYWAY,

09:11.725 --> 09:13.378
AND HE HAD YOU ARRESTED,

09:13.422 --> 09:15.337
OR WHEN HE SAID
NO PARTIES IN THE PENTHOUSE,

09:15.380 --> 09:16.991
AND YOU HAD ONE ANYWAY,
AND HE CALLED

09:17.034 --> 09:18.949
THE POLICE COMMISSIONER
TO LAND A HELICOPTER

09:18.993 --> 09:21.778
ON THE ROOF TO HAVE
YOU ARRESTED?

09:21.822 --> 09:23.650
I CAN KEEP GOING.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.828
IF I CAN STOP TITAN
BEFORE HE KILLS
ANYONE ELSE,

09:27.871 --> 09:29.917
THEN MY DAD AND THE REST
OF THE CROWS,

09:29.960 --> 09:32.397
THEY MIGHT START SEEING
BATWOMAN AS ONE
OF THE GOOD GUYS.

09:32.441 --> 09:37.141
JACOB KANE WILL NEVER
SEE A VIGILANTE AS ONE
OF THE GOOD GUYS.

09:37.185 --> 09:40.492
JACOB KANE HAS NEVER MET
A VIGILANTE WHO IS
ALSO HIS DAUGHTER.

09:40.536 --> 09:43.365
IF I CAN START CHANGING
THE WAY THAT HE SEES BATWOMAN,

09:43.408 --> 09:45.062
THEN MAYBE ONE DAY
I CAN COME CLEAN

09:45.106 --> 09:47.151
ABOUT WHO BATWOMAN
REALLY IS.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.860
DON ELEKTRON, MACHA KIDDO,

10:23.100 --> 10:24.667

10:24.711 --> 10:26.451
FOR A MAN WHO PLAYS

10:26.495 --> 10:28.410
THIS MUST BE
VERY EXCITING,

10:28.453 --> 10:29.803
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.848
I AM LOOKING
FOR A LITTLE GREEN NUGGET

10:31.892 --> 10:33.937
CALLED KRYPTONITE.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.244
-KRYPTONITE?
-MM-HMM.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.549
YOU MEAN KAOLINITE.

10:37.593 --> 10:41.075
DO I, OR DO I
MEAN KRYPTONITE?

10:41.118 --> 10:46.297
MAYBE KIMBERLITE
OR KYANITE

10:46.341 --> 10:49.257
OR, UM, CHAROITE.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.346
THE HEAD OF
THE GEOLOGY DEPARTMENT,

10:51.389 --> 10:52.564
AND DUMB AS--

10:53.957 --> 10:56.699
PROFESSOR DARBY,
YOUR NAME WAS WRITTEN

10:56.743 --> 10:58.919
BESIDE IT IN A JOURNAL.

10:58.962 --> 11:03.706
GLOWS GREEN,
CUTS THROUGH ANYTHING.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.230
A MINERAL WITH
A NATURAL GREEN
LUMINESCENCE

11:06.274 --> 11:07.928
AND STRONG
COVALENT BONDS

11:07.971 --> 11:11.018
WITH THAT KIND
OF CUTTING POWER?

11:11.061 --> 11:13.673
ACTUALLY, I DID
ANALYZE SOMETHING

11:13.716 --> 11:15.936
WITH THOSE
PROPERTIES ONCE.

11:15.979 --> 11:18.155
IT WASN'T CALLED
KRYPTONITE.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.505
IT WAS SOME KIND OF
RARE METEOR ROCK.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.899
THERE YOU GO.

11:22.943 --> 11:25.728
-HAND IT OVER.
-I CAN'T.

11:25.772 --> 11:28.209
IT WAS SENT BACK
TO ITS OWNER--
LUCIUS FOX.

11:28.252 --> 11:34.868
HMM. LUCIUS FOX
IS DEAD.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.565
IT--IT JUST SAYS,
"LUCIUS FOX,

11:36.608 --> 11:38.393
WAYNE ENTERPRISES,
GOTHAM CITY."

11:38.436 --> 11:40.351
AND WHAT DO YOU
SUPPOSE I DO,

11:40.395 --> 11:44.138
JUST WALTZ INTO WAYNE
AND ASK FOR IT NICELY?

11:44.181 --> 11:47.924
I DON'T KNOW, OK?
IT'S NOT HERE.

11:47.968 --> 11:51.101
YOU NEED TO GO TALK
TO THEM.

11:51.145 --> 11:54.148
WELL, THEN I SUPPOSE
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

11:54.191 --> 12:00.328
UNTIL THEN, IT'S PROBABLY
BEST NOBODY KNOWS
I WAS HERE, HMM,

12:00.371 --> 12:01.851
AND WITH THAT...

12:04.593 --> 12:08.205
I BELIEVE THE GEOLOGY DEPARTMENT
NEEDS A NEW HEAD.

12:16.648 --> 12:19.390
STILL HASN'T CHECKED IN
SINCE YOU LOOKED
10 SECONDS AGO.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.915
SORRY IF THE IDEA
OF MY DAD KILLING MY SISTER

12:21.958 --> 12:23.743
IS SOMEWHAT
OF A CONCERN TO ME.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.396
THE SUIT IS BULLETPROOF.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.094
BESIDES, KATE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

12:27.137 --> 12:29.052
NO. KATE THINKS SHE
KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING,

12:29.096 --> 12:31.054
WHICH CAN BE WORSE
THAN MOST PEOPLE
NOT KNOWING

12:31.098 --> 12:32.403
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.933
YEAH. ME INCLUDED
APPARENTLY.

12:39.976 --> 12:43.153
LOOK. I'VE TRIED
ACETIC, SULFURIC,
AND HYDROCHLORIC--

12:43.197 --> 12:44.981
ALL NONREACTIVE.

12:45.025 --> 12:49.812
I CAN SEE WHY THIS THING
CAN PENETRATE THE BATSUIT.

12:49.856 --> 12:53.033
HAVE YOU TRIED
CRUSHING IT?

12:53.076 --> 12:54.730
WITH WHAT, A HAMMER?

12:57.298 --> 12:59.822
-I SAID I WAS NERVOUS.
-RIGHT.

13:03.086 --> 13:06.655
SINGER: ♪ OOH, OH,
OOH, OH ♪

13:06.698 --> 13:10.050
♪ I LIKE THE PRESSURE,
I LIKE THE PRESSURE ♪

13:10.093 --> 13:13.880
♪ OOH, OH,
OOH, OH ♪

13:13.923 --> 13:18.232
♪ I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE STORM
'CAUSE IT'S ALL MINE ♪

13:23.106 --> 13:26.153
KATE: I'M EXHAUSTED
JUST WATCHING YOU.

13:26.196 --> 13:27.545
WHO'S THERE?

13:27.589 --> 13:29.112
SOMEONE WHO THINKS
YOU'RE PRETTY BOLD

13:29.156 --> 13:31.549
TO BE RUNNING BLEACHERS
WITH TITAN ON THE PROWL.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.508
IF THIS IS ABOUT
SEASON TICKETS,

13:33.551 --> 13:35.292
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.947
IF THIS IS
ABOUT MY BROTHER,

13:37.991 --> 13:39.470
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

13:39.514 --> 13:41.472
I GUESS MY QUESTION IS
ARE YOU HELPING HIM?

13:41.516 --> 13:43.518
YOU'RE THE ONLY FAMILY
HE HAS LEFT.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.476
I DON'T THINK HE
SEES IT THAT WAY,

13:45.520 --> 13:47.130
NOT AFTER I TESTIFIED
AGAINST HIM

13:47.174 --> 13:48.828
AND GOT HIM SENT AWAY
TO ARKHAM.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.264
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

13:50.307 --> 13:52.005
GOT A DANGEROUS PSYCHOPATH
OFF THE STREETS.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.920
-HE'S NOT A PSYCHOPATH.
-TELL IT TO THE REF

13:53.963 --> 13:55.095
HE MURDERED
ON THE FIELD.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.879
HE WANTED TO WIN

13:56.923 --> 13:58.489
SO MUCH THAT HE WAS
WILLING TO HAVE

13:58.533 --> 13:59.926
HIS SOUL BEATEN
OUT OF HIM--

13:59.969 --> 14:01.797
EVERY PRACTICE,
EVERY GAME,

14:01.841 --> 14:03.755
EVERY HIT
TO THE HEAD.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.409
YOU KNOW,
HE USED TO WALK
THE NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS

14:05.453 --> 14:07.890
TO THE BUS TO MAKE
SURE THEY WERE SAFE?

14:07.934 --> 14:12.808
10 YEARS LATER, HE
RIPPED A REF'S SPINE
OUT OF HIS NECK.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.505
THIS GAME TURNED HIM
INTO A MONSTER.

14:14.549 --> 14:18.248
THEN HELP ME MAKE SURE
HE DOESN'T DIE ONE.

14:18.292 --> 14:22.470
MAKE SURE HE GETS
THE HELP HE NEEDS.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.602
TELL ME WHERE TO FIND HIM.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.912
APOLLO!

14:29.956 --> 14:32.088
YOU BETRAYED ME!

14:32.132 --> 14:33.873
THIS IS THE PART
WHERE YOU RUN.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.487
AAH!

14:46.929 --> 14:48.061
OH!

15:04.512 --> 15:06.122
AAH!

15:16.567 --> 15:19.266
YOU ABANDONED ME
TO A PRISON.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.659
NOW THIS ONE
WILL BE YOURS.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.574
UNH!

15:32.148 --> 15:32.932
I'M REPORTING LIVE HERE
AT THE SCENE

15:32.975 --> 15:34.934
OF YET ANOTHER GRISLY ATTACK

15:34.977 --> 15:37.110
BY THE FUGITIVE
TIM "THE TITAN" TESLOW,

15:37.153 --> 15:40.287
AND THIS TIME, THE VICTIM
WAS HIS OWN BROTHER,

15:40.330 --> 15:42.289
STAR RUNNING BACK
FOR THE GOTHAM GOLIATHS

15:42.332 --> 15:44.291
APOLLO TESLOW.

15:44.334 --> 15:47.555
COMMANDER KANE.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.209
COMMANDER KANE,
ANY COMMENTS

15:49.252 --> 15:51.254
ON THIS LATEST ATTACK,
AND WHAT ABOUT REPORTS

15:51.298 --> 15:54.127
THAT NOT EVEN BATWOMAN
WAS ABLE TO STOP TITAN?

15:54.170 --> 15:56.651
BATWOMAN IS THE REASON
LUNATICS LIKE TITAN ARE

15:56.694 --> 15:58.000
ON THE STREET
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.741
WE GOT ONE MAN DEAD

15:59.784 --> 16:01.786
AND ONE OF GOTHAM'S
MOST PROMISING ATHLETES

16:01.830 --> 16:03.266
CUT DOWN IN HIS PRIME.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.094
SO YOU DON'T SEE
BATWOMAN'S EFFORTS

16:05.138 --> 16:07.183
TO STOP TITAN
AS HELPFUL?

16:07.227 --> 16:09.707
I SEE BATWOMAN LIKE
I SEE EVERY VIGILANTE--

16:09.751 --> 16:11.709
A THREAT TO THE GOOD PEOPLE
OF THIS CITY.

16:11.753 --> 16:14.234
THE CROWS AND THE GCPD
WILL BRING HER TO JUSTICE,

16:14.277 --> 16:16.149
AND WE WILL NOT
DISCRIMINATE

16:16.192 --> 16:17.977
BETWEEN THE BAT
AND THOSE WHO AID HER,

16:18.020 --> 16:21.110
ABET HER, OR SO MUCH
AS TURN ON A DAMN BAT-LIGHT!

16:21.154 --> 16:23.069
DEWITT: THAT WAS CROWS
COMMANDER KANE

16:23.112 --> 16:26.246
WITH SOME POINTED WORDS
FOR BATWOMAN AND HER FOLLOWERS.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.291
I DON'T REMEMBER TENSIONS
LIKE THESE

16:28.335 --> 16:30.337
SINCE COMMISSIONER LOEB
AND BATMAN,

16:30.380 --> 16:33.253
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION
WHO IF ANYONE

16:33.296 --> 16:35.429
CAN KEEP GOTHAM CITY SAFE?

16:35.472 --> 16:37.605
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
RESET YOUR SHOULDER.

16:37.648 --> 16:41.348
FAIR WARNING,
THIS IS GONNA HURT A LOT.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.045
UNH!

16:43.089 --> 16:45.265
NO COMMENT.

16:45.308 --> 16:46.657
THAT WAS JULIA.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.224
SHE SAW YOUR DAD
ON THE NEWS

16:48.268 --> 16:49.617
AND THINKS YOU
SHOULD SIT THIS ONE OUT.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.401
YOU MIGHT NOT
HAVE A CHOICE.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.534
I'LL NEED
AN X-RAY TO MAKE SURE,

16:53.577 --> 16:56.580
BUT I'M GUESSING YOU HAVE
A COUPLE OF CRACKED RIBS.

16:56.624 --> 16:58.495
I'LL BE LUCKY
IF IT'S JUST A COUPLE.

16:58.539 --> 16:59.975
I'VE NEVER BEEN UP
AGAINST SOMEONE

17:00.019 --> 17:01.368
THIS STRONG
BEFORE, MARY.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.196
IT WAS LIKE I WAS
NOTHING TO HIM.

17:03.239 --> 17:05.807
ALL THE MORE REASON
TO AVOID A REMATCH

17:05.850 --> 17:08.505
AT LAST FOR A FEW WEEKS
UNTIL YOU'VE HAD
TIME TO HEAL.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.159
I DON'T HAVE
A FEW WEEKS.

17:10.203 --> 17:11.726
TITAN'S ON SOME
KILLING SPREE,

17:11.769 --> 17:13.162
AND WE HAVE NO WAY
OF KNOWING WHO HE'S

17:13.206 --> 17:14.729
GONNA STRIKE AT NEXT.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.600
ACTUALLY, MAYBE
WE DO.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.907
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE THIS.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.561
LUKE: THAT COMMUTER
HE BEHEADED ON THE SUBWAY

17:20.604 --> 17:21.910
WASN'T JUST SOME
RANDOM GUY.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.738
HE HAD A CONNECTION
TO TITAN.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.131
HE USED TO BE AN ADMINISTRATOR
AT HIS UNIVERSITY'S

17:25.174 --> 17:27.785
NEURO CLINIC
UNTIL HE WAS FIRED

17:27.829 --> 17:31.441
FOR...FALSIFYING
STUDENT ATHLETES' BRAIN SCANS.

17:31.485 --> 17:34.836
APOLLO SAID THE GAME
TURNED HIS BROTHER
INTO A MONSTER.

17:34.879 --> 17:36.968
OR THE PEOPLE
BEHIND THE GAME.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.154
WHERE'S THE ROCK?

17:48.197 --> 17:50.373
HIDDEN AMONG 45 STORIES
OF ANYWHERE

17:50.417 --> 17:53.028
AND A MILLION SQUARE FEET
OF POSSIBILITY.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.551
OUR BELOVED LITTLE ROCK
MAY AS WELL BE

17:54.595 --> 17:57.685
A GRAIN OF SAND
UPON A BEACH.

17:57.728 --> 17:59.295
SO...

18:02.559 --> 18:04.344
THAT'S IT THEN.
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.650
IT'S OVER.
WE CAN LEAVE NOW.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.652
OR WE CAN WALK RIGHT
THROUGH THE DOOR
AND ASK FOR IT.

18:08.696 --> 18:11.264
HEY!

18:11.307 --> 18:13.135
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:13.179 --> 18:17.618
EVERYONE KNOWS EYEBROWS
DON'T GROW THEMSELVES.

18:17.661 --> 18:20.882
YOU'RE MAKING HIM
A FACE.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.666
YOU PROMISED ME
WE WERE GONNA KILL HIM.

18:22.710 --> 18:27.062
WE WILL, BUT TODAY,
HE'S AN INTEGRAL PART
OF MY PLAN.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.933
AND TOMORROW?
WHAT THEN?

18:28.977 --> 18:30.370
AND THE NEXT DAY?
WHAT THEN?

18:30.413 --> 18:31.980
WHEN DOES THIS END?

18:32.023 --> 18:33.547
WHY ARE YOU
PRESSURING ME?

18:33.590 --> 18:36.811
BECAUSE WE'RE BEING
HUNTED, ALICE.

18:36.854 --> 18:38.769
IS THIS RABID OBSESSION
WITH YOUR FAMILY

18:38.813 --> 18:41.120
REALLY WORTH IT
IF WE BOTH END UP DEAD?

18:43.339 --> 18:45.298
I SUPPOSE IT IS.

18:49.737 --> 18:53.044
WELL, NOT FOR ME,
IT'S NOT.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.485
IT'S OVER, ALICE.
I'M LEAVING.

19:00.487 --> 19:04.012
HEH. AND WHERE DO YOU
IMAGINE GOING?

19:05.753 --> 19:08.147
WHERE WE'VE ALWAYS
PLANNED TO GO.

19:10.279 --> 19:13.674
TO THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN
AMONG THE BRIGHT
FLOWER BEDS

19:13.717 --> 19:16.459
AND THE COOL FOUNTAINS.

19:19.114 --> 19:24.032
YOU OUT
IN THE WORLD ALONE?

19:24.075 --> 19:26.687
HA HA HA!

19:26.730 --> 19:29.559
HOW WOULD YOU EVEN
SURVIVE?

19:33.694 --> 19:35.609
THE SAME WAY
I SURVIVED IN ARKHAM

19:35.652 --> 19:38.873
FOR 5 YEARS WITHOUT
YOU VISITING ME ONCE,

19:38.916 --> 19:41.049
NOT ON MY BIRTHDAY

19:41.092 --> 19:43.007
OR A HOLIDAY

19:43.051 --> 19:45.488
OR EVEN JUST BECAUSE.

19:45.532 --> 19:49.231
YOU REALLY THINK
I CAN'T SURVIVE
WITHOUT YOU?

19:49.275 --> 19:51.625
ALICE, BETWEEN
THE TWO OF US,

19:51.668 --> 19:54.541
I'M NOT THE ONE
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

19:54.584 --> 19:57.935
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME
ALL ALONE.

19:57.979 --> 20:01.069
THEN DON'T MAKE ME.

20:01.112 --> 20:04.115
FORGET ALL THIS.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.769
COME WITH ME.

20:10.252 --> 20:14.430
I WOULD NEVER LET YOU
LEAVE ME, MY LITTLE MOUSE...

20:20.610 --> 20:23.483
BUT WE MUST LEAVE
GOTHAM THE RIGHT WAY--

20:25.267 --> 20:28.052
-WITH A PARTY.
-HEH.

20:32.709 --> 20:35.277
EVERY SEASON, TITAN
UNDERWENT A MANDATORY
BRAIN SCAN

20:35.321 --> 20:37.758
TO ASSESS
HIS ELIGIBILITY TO PLAY,

20:37.801 --> 20:41.675
AND GOTHAM U CLAIMED THIS

20:41.718 --> 20:43.720
WAS HIS MOST RECENT
BRAIN SCAN.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.374
TOTALLY HEALTHY,

20:45.418 --> 20:47.724
BUT AFTER DIGGING DEEP
INTO THE NEURO CLINIC RECORDS

20:47.768 --> 20:50.074
THANKS TO MARY'S MED SCHOOL
CONNECTIONS...

20:50.118 --> 20:52.207
TECHNICALLY, IT'S NOT
A HIPAA VIOLATION

20:52.251 --> 20:54.557
IF YOU'RE NOT
A REAL DOCTOR.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.472
TURNS OUT THIS...

20:58.257 --> 20:59.954
WAS HIS ACTUAL
BRAIN SCAN.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.956
MARY: OH, GOD.
ALL THOSE YEARS

21:01.999 --> 21:03.958
OF HEAD TRAUMA.

21:04.001 --> 21:06.526
DORSAL POSTERIOR INSULAR IS
BASICALLY SHRIVELED TO NOTHING.

21:06.569 --> 21:08.310
THAT SOUNDS
REALLY BAD.

21:08.354 --> 21:09.920
IT'S THE PART OF THE BRAIN
THAT GOVERNS PAIN.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.835
NO WONDER HE DIDN'T
FEEL THAT BATARANG.

21:11.879 --> 21:13.402
THEY COVER IT ALL UP,
AND THEY GIVE YOU

21:13.446 --> 21:15.796
A BIG, FAT CHAMPIONSHIP RING
FOR YOUR TROUBLES.

21:18.189 --> 21:20.714
WOW. INTERESTING.

21:20.757 --> 21:23.369
GU's COACH DONAHUE TOOK
AN EARLY RETIREMENT

21:23.412 --> 21:25.675
RIGHT BEFORE
THE SCANDAL BROKE.

21:25.719 --> 21:28.112
ALL RIGHT. HE MIGHT
BE TITAN'S NEXT VICTIM.

21:28.156 --> 21:29.679
-UGH.
-WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

21:29.723 --> 21:31.681
YOU CAN BARELY STAND,
MUCH LESS TAKE ON

21:31.725 --> 21:34.293
A LITERAL GOLIATH WHO'S
HELLA IMPERVIOUS TO PAIN.

21:34.336 --> 21:36.425
YEAH. NOT TO MENTION,
THE CROWS WOULD LOVE

21:36.469 --> 21:38.035
TO PUT YOUR POINTY-EARED
HEAD ON A PIKE.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.733
AND WHAT DO YOU
EXPECT ME TO DO, HMM,

21:39.776 --> 21:41.343
STAND DOWN,

21:41.387 --> 21:43.563
JUST LET TITAN RAMPAGE
THROUGH GOTHAM?

21:46.087 --> 21:48.263
MARY: WELL...

21:48.307 --> 21:50.831
THERE IS ANOTHER IDEA...

21:52.615 --> 21:54.704
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.672
GO, GO, GO!

22:05.715 --> 22:07.848
IF YOU SEE THE BAT, SHOOT.

22:07.891 --> 22:10.503
GOT SOMETHING
BEHIND THE LIGHT.

22:10.546 --> 22:12.853
DON'T SHOOT!

22:12.896 --> 22:15.464
I'M HERE ON BEHALF
OF BATWOMAN.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.031
OHH! UGH!

22:21.862 --> 22:23.690
JACOB: WHERE IS SHE?
MARY: DAD!

22:23.733 --> 22:26.562
I'M FINE.

22:26.606 --> 22:28.564
EVERYTHING'S OK.

22:31.741 --> 22:34.048
JACOB: WHAT'S GOING ON?
HOW THE HELL DID SHE
GET TO YOU?

22:34.091 --> 22:37.443
CAN YOU JUST PLEASE
TALK TO HER?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.406
YOU JUST MADE THIS
WAY TOO PERSONAL.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.016
KATE, VOICE MODULATED:
WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT TITAN.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.715
WHICH PART, ABOUT HOW
HE DOESN'T PLAY THE RULES

22:48.758 --> 22:50.499
OR CARE ABOUT
COLLATERAL DAMAGE?

22:50.543 --> 22:52.588
I WANT TO TEAM UP.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.460
WE CAN TAKE HIM ON
TOGETHER.

22:54.503 --> 22:57.288
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
TITAN TOO MUCH FOR
YOUR ARMY OF ONE?

22:57.332 --> 23:00.161
HONESTLY, YEAH.
I COULD USE SOME MUSCLE,

23:00.204 --> 23:02.293
AND YOU COULD USE ME
BECAUSE I KNOW

23:02.337 --> 23:03.904
HOW TO DRAW HIM OUT.

23:03.947 --> 23:05.645
OH, LIKE YOU DREW ME OUT
BY USING MY OWN DAUGHTER?

23:05.688 --> 23:07.516
WHAT SORT OF WANNABE HERO
PUTS AN INNOCENT GIRL

23:07.560 --> 23:09.431
IN FRONT
OF A FIRING SQUAD?

23:09.475 --> 23:12.086
COULD HAVE BLOWN
HER DAMN HEAD OFF!

23:12.129 --> 23:15.002
-AAH!
-EVERYONE OFF THE ROOF NOW!

23:15.045 --> 23:17.396
YOU HEARD HIM. GO. GO.

23:19.223 --> 23:20.573
HOW THE HELL DID SHE
FIND YOU?

23:20.616 --> 23:22.226
SHE DIDN'T.
I FOUND HER.

23:22.270 --> 23:23.706
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

23:23.750 --> 23:25.969
I'M SAYING THIS WAS
MY IDEA.

23:26.013 --> 23:27.710
YOU TOLD ME THAT
THE CROWS WANTED TO

23:27.754 --> 23:29.233
MAKE OVER THEIR IMAGE.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.453
WHY NOT START
BY ALLYING YOURSELF

23:31.497 --> 23:34.456
WITH SOMEONE THE CITY
ACTUALLY ROOTS FOR?

23:34.500 --> 23:35.936
YOU DID THIS?

23:35.979 --> 23:38.242
I KNEW I'M ONE
OF THE ONLY PEOPLE

23:38.286 --> 23:41.507
WHO CAN GET
THROUGH TO YOU.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.857
I BELIEVE IN HER, DAD.

23:43.900 --> 23:47.556
MARY, I SAID ANYONE
AFFILIATED WITH HER

23:47.600 --> 23:49.297
WILL BE BROUGHT
TO JUSTICE.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.038
OK. THEN ARREST ME.
ARREST ME

23:51.081 --> 23:53.127
FOR BELIEVING
IN SOMEONE WHO
SAVES LIVES

23:53.170 --> 23:55.738
AND WHO STOPS CRIMINALS
AND WHO INSPIRES HOPE

23:55.782 --> 23:57.610
WITHOUT CHARGING
A PENNY FOR IT!

23:57.653 --> 23:59.350
I'M YOUR DAUGHTER,
AND IF I DON'T BELIEVE

23:59.394 --> 24:01.483
IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
THEN HOW CAN YOU EXPECT

24:01.527 --> 24:03.659
A CITY OF STRANGERS TO?

24:05.531 --> 24:07.184
EXCEPT THE PERSON
YOU BELIEVE IN

24:07.228 --> 24:09.926
DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THE GUTS
TO SHOW HER FACE.

24:12.973 --> 24:15.105
I CAN'T SHOW YOU
MY FACE,

24:15.149 --> 24:19.370
BUT I CAN OFFER YOU THIS,
A TRUCE.

24:19.414 --> 24:21.460
WE PARTNER UP

24:21.503 --> 24:23.331
AND PROTECT
THE CITY TOGETHER.

24:27.378 --> 24:28.771
PLEASE.

24:38.346 --> 24:41.654
SO HOW DO WE GET HIM?

24:41.697 --> 24:44.047
I'M AT GOTHAM CITY ARENA
WITH GOTHAM UNIVERSITY'S

24:44.091 --> 24:47.007
FORMER HEAD COACH
KURT DONAHUE.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.052
KURT, WHAT ARE
YOUR THOUGHTS?

24:49.096 --> 24:51.272
IF YOU'RE
LISTENING, TITAN,

24:51.315 --> 24:53.666
I'M SORRY FOR THINKING
THE SPORT WAS BIGGER

24:53.709 --> 24:55.494
THAN A HUMAN LIFE,

24:55.537 --> 24:58.366
AND I HOPE YOU'LL
COME JOIN ME
ON THE 50-YARD LINE,

24:58.409 --> 25:01.238
WHERE I CAN APOLOGIZE
TO YOU IN PERSON.

25:01.282 --> 25:05.634
ALICE: IT'S CALLED
A TRAUMA BOND EXERCISE.

25:05.678 --> 25:07.854
WE DESTROY THE THING
THAT ANCHORS US TO OUR PAIN

25:07.897 --> 25:10.552
SO THAT WE CAN MOVE ON.

25:10.596 --> 25:14.991
LOOK WHO PAID ATTENTION
IN GROUP THERAPY.

25:15.035 --> 25:19.082
-MAYBE A LITTLE.
-HEH.

25:19.126 --> 25:22.521
THIS BOOK IS
OUR CHAIN.

25:22.564 --> 25:26.176
IT LOCKS US
TO THE CATERPILLAR,

25:26.220 --> 25:29.702
THE QUEEN,

25:29.745 --> 25:32.008
THAT BASEMENT CELL.

25:34.228 --> 25:38.319
IT BINDS US TO
EVERY TERRIBLE

25:38.362 --> 25:41.583
AND TWISTED THING
WE WERE FORCED TO ENDURE.

25:51.201 --> 25:53.987
BURNING IT BREAKS
OUR ATTACHMENT

25:54.030 --> 25:56.642
AND FREES US
TO MOVE ON...

25:58.861 --> 26:01.255
WHICH WE ALWAYS
INTENDED TO DO.

26:07.304 --> 26:08.610
MOVE ON.

26:14.224 --> 26:16.966
WHAT HAPPENED
TO US

26:17.010 --> 26:18.968
SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN
TO ANYONE...

26:21.797 --> 26:23.538
BUT THERE'S NO ONE
IN THE WORLD

26:23.582 --> 26:25.888
I WOULD HAVE RATHER
GONE THROUGH IT WITH
THAN YOU.

26:28.717 --> 26:30.545
NOR I WITHOUT YOU.

26:34.418 --> 26:36.029
AND I MEAN THIS

26:36.072 --> 26:37.944
WITH ALL OF MY HEART.

26:44.254 --> 26:47.431
I STILL WANT TO JOIN YOU
IN THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN...

26:49.695 --> 26:53.350
AND SMELL THE SEASONS
IN BRIGHT FLOWER BEDS

26:53.394 --> 26:57.180
AND MAKE A WISH
IN COOL FOUNTAINS.

26:57.224 --> 26:59.748
I WANT TO MEET A MAN
WITH MANY HATS...

26:59.792 --> 27:01.358
HA HA HA!

27:01.402 --> 27:03.883
AND SMILE BACK
AT THE CHESHIRE CAT

27:03.926 --> 27:05.754
AND RUN...

27:05.798 --> 27:07.626
WITH YOU FOREVER...

27:11.064 --> 27:14.371
THROUGH OUR WONDERLAND.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.554
ALICE.

27:28.864 --> 27:30.213
NO.

27:32.215 --> 27:35.523
WHAT DID YOU DO?

27:35.566 --> 27:38.091
YOU MADE ME CHOOSE.

27:38.134 --> 27:41.268
YOU POISONED ME?

27:41.311 --> 27:43.183
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

27:43.226 --> 27:46.795
BE--BECAUSE I COULDN'T
LET YOU LEAVE ME.

27:46.839 --> 27:49.711
NOT YOU, TOO.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.845
THIS--

27:52.888 --> 27:55.804
THIS WASN'T
EVEN REAL?

28:07.903 --> 28:09.644
IF ONLY PAIN COULD TURN
TO ASH

28:09.688 --> 28:11.690
WITH THE STRIKE
OF A MATCH...

28:14.518 --> 28:17.957
BUT MY PAIN IS
A PART OF ME

28:18.000 --> 28:21.395
THE WAY MY FAMILY
IS A PART OF ME,

28:21.438 --> 28:25.225
AND YOU COULD NEVER
UNDERSTAND WHY I NEED

28:25.268 --> 28:27.836
TO ENACT MY REVENGE

28:27.880 --> 28:31.231
BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER
EXPERIENCED...

28:31.274 --> 28:33.276
TRUE BETRAYAL.

28:36.149 --> 28:39.369
AT LEAST NOT
UNTIL NOW.

28:45.288 --> 28:49.815
GOOD-BYE...
MY SWEET MOUSE.

28:53.949 --> 28:57.866
MY BROTHER,

28:57.910 --> 29:00.782
MY EVERYTHING.

29:12.620 --> 29:15.057
I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN
IN WONDERLAND.

29:31.421 --> 29:34.468
ARE WE MISSING
THE COMPANY PARTY
OR SOMETHING?

29:40.039 --> 29:41.692
WHERE'S THE COMMANDER?

29:41.736 --> 29:43.477
IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK
AT THE ARENA WITH BATWOMAN.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.957
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WITH BATWOMAN?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.568
THEY TEAMED UP TO
BRING DOWN TITAN.

29:47.611 --> 29:49.570
TWO HOURS AGO,
HE SAID HE'D
ARREST ANYONE

29:49.613 --> 29:50.963
AFFILIATED WITH HER.

29:51.006 --> 29:52.573
NOW HE'S TAGGING HER
INTO THE RING?

29:52.616 --> 29:54.227
SOMETHING'S UP.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.924
WE NEED TO GET THERE.

29:55.968 --> 29:57.752
CALL HER AND GIVE
HER THE HEADS-UP.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.014

TO THE BUS STOP,

32:10.189 --> 32:11.581
MAKE SURE THEY WERE SAFE.

32:13.757 --> 32:16.108
I KNOW THAT PERSON IS
STILL INSIDE YOU.

32:22.244 --> 32:24.507
I DIDN'T WANT TO
BE THIS.

32:24.551 --> 32:26.205
I KNOW.

32:34.343 --> 32:36.693
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO KILL HIM!

32:46.181 --> 32:47.443
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:52.753 --> 32:54.581
WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM.

32:57.236 --> 32:59.716
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.240
WE'RE ON HE SAME TEAM.

UNH!

33:18.822 --> 33:21.477
SOPHIE: STOP!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:34.229 --> 33:35.970
SOPHIE: IS THAT WHY
YOU SIDELINED ME TODAY?

33:36.014 --> 33:37.580
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ME
OFF THE FIELD

33:37.624 --> 33:39.104
TO LAUNCH THIS APP, FINE,
BUT IF YOU'RE USING IT

33:39.147 --> 33:40.757
TO DISTRACT ME WHILE
YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE

33:40.801 --> 33:42.324
ARE TRYING TO
TAKE OUT BATWOMAN--

33:42.368 --> 33:44.370
AND WHY WOULD I NEED
TO DO THAT, AGENT MOORE?

33:44.413 --> 33:46.154
BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE
GONE BEHIND YOUR OWN
TEAM'S BACK

33:46.198 --> 33:47.634
TO PROTECT
A CRIMINAL?

33:47.677 --> 33:49.027
I'M PROTECTING YOU

33:49.070 --> 33:50.550
FROM BEING ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF THIS.

33:50.593 --> 33:52.334
WHAT IS IT
ABOUT HER?

33:52.378 --> 33:54.554
YOU, NOW MARY.
TELL ME WHAT
I'M MESSING.

33:54.597 --> 33:59.689
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
SIR, HOPE.

33:59.733 --> 34:01.691
IF IT WEREN'T FOR HER,
MY WIFE'S KILLER

34:01.735 --> 34:03.650
WOULD STILL BE
IN ARKHAM.

34:03.693 --> 34:07.349
HOPE IS A LUXURY
I DON'T HAVE.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.141
THOUGHT YOU TWO USED
TO BE TIGHT.

34:16.184 --> 34:18.360
WE ARE.

34:18.404 --> 34:22.147
AT LEAST WE WERE.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.890
I THOUGHT YOU CALLED
BATWOMAN TO WARN HER.

34:26.934 --> 34:29.067
I DID.
SHE DIDN'T LISTEN.

34:30.938 --> 34:33.419
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

34:33.462 --> 34:36.987
I DON'T KNOW.

34:37.031 --> 34:39.164
MAYBE I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR FLAWS

34:39.207 --> 34:42.036
BECAUSE I'M TERRIFIED
OF BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH A WOMAN.

34:44.865 --> 34:48.564
OH. NO. I'M PRETTY MUCH
BEING SHADY

34:48.608 --> 34:50.827
BY DESIGN, LUV.

34:50.871 --> 34:52.829
OK.

34:52.873 --> 34:58.574
SO IN ONE OF MY MANY
THRILLING AND SEXY ADVENTURES,

34:58.618 --> 35:02.143
I MET THE WRONG PERSON
AND PROCEEDED TO BETRAY HER.

35:02.187 --> 35:05.712
SO YOU'RE HIDING?
FROM WHO?

35:05.755 --> 35:07.801
HER NAME'S SAFIYAH,
AND I'LL SAY NO MORE

35:07.844 --> 35:11.587
BECAUSE I'LL ONLY
PULL YOU INTO IT.

35:11.631 --> 35:17.724
A SEXY AND THRILLING
ADVENTURE?

35:17.767 --> 35:19.378
MAYBE I WANT TO BE
PULLED IN.

35:19.421 --> 35:21.641
OH, I WISH IT WERE
THAT SIMPLE, LUV.

35:24.687 --> 35:26.907
I KNEW I HAD A TARGET
ON MY BACK.

35:26.950 --> 35:30.040
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
ITS CIRCUMFERENCE.

35:33.479 --> 35:36.046
THESE WERE LEFT
AT MY HOTEL THIS MORNING.

35:49.059 --> 35:52.237
DO YOU NEED THIS?

35:52.280 --> 35:53.499
HMM.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.509
MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY.

36:12.909 --> 36:14.694
I ACTUALLY PICTURED
MYSELF COMING OUT TO HIM

36:14.737 --> 36:17.131
AS BATWOMAN ONE DAY.

36:17.175 --> 36:20.830
I LOOKED HIM IN THE EYES,
AND I BELIEVED HIM.

36:25.226 --> 36:29.578
I'M REALLY, REALLY
SORRY, KATE.

36:29.622 --> 36:32.538
IF IT MEANS
ANYTHING TO YOU,

36:32.581 --> 36:34.670
I BELIEVED HIM, TOO.

36:39.762 --> 36:41.764
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
WHEN I PUT
THAT SUIT ON

36:41.808 --> 36:43.723
THAT NOTHING
COULD HURT ME...

36:46.639 --> 36:48.206
BUT I WAS WRONG.

36:50.947 --> 36:54.255
HIS BETRAYAL HURT

36:54.299 --> 36:57.084
A MILLION TIMES
MORE THAN ANY
OF THOSE BULLETS.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.480
-MY DAD HATES ME.
-NO.

37:01.523 --> 37:04.091
BATWOMAN.
HE HATES BATWOMAN.

37:04.134 --> 37:06.224
YOU HE LOVES.

37:06.267 --> 37:08.965
HE ONCE LOVED
BETH, TOO.

37:09.009 --> 37:11.664
IN HIS MIND, BATWOMAN
IS JUST AS CRAZY AS ALICE.

37:11.707 --> 37:13.187
HE'S WRONG.

37:17.670 --> 37:19.976
THANK YOU FOR HAVING
MY BACK TODAY.

37:23.545 --> 37:25.634
TO SISTERS.

37:25.678 --> 37:27.245
TO SISTERS.

37:30.726 --> 37:32.859
AM I INTERRUPTING?

37:32.902 --> 37:35.470
COME IN.

37:35.514 --> 37:37.516
MAY I PRESENT TO YOU...

37:41.084 --> 37:43.304
I'LL STICK
WITH BOOZE, THANKS.

37:43.348 --> 37:44.914
WHAT? NO.
THAT'S NOT--

37:44.958 --> 37:47.265
THAT'S KRYPTONITE.

37:47.308 --> 37:48.788
I FIGURED OUT
HOW TO DESTROY IT.

37:48.831 --> 37:51.660
OH, MY GOD.
YOU USED A HAMMER.

37:51.704 --> 37:54.446
OK. MORE LIKE 40,000 TONS
OF COMPRESSIVE FORCE.

37:54.489 --> 37:56.361
WAYNE HAS ACCESS
TO A HYDRAULIC PRESS.

37:56.404 --> 37:58.667
MM-HMM. SO...

37:58.711 --> 38:01.888
JUST A REALLY EXPENSIVE
HAMMER.

38:01.931 --> 38:03.237
YEAH, MARY.
THIS WAS ALL THANKS

38:03.281 --> 38:04.978
TO YOUR BRILLIANT
HAMMER IDEA.

38:05.021 --> 38:06.458
MM-HMM.

38:06.501 --> 38:08.068
POINT BEING
THIS IS WHAT'S LEFT

38:08.111 --> 38:10.462
OF THE ONLY THING
ON EARTH

38:10.505 --> 38:12.333
THAT CAN PENETRATE
THE BATSUIT.

38:16.903 --> 38:19.732
-OK.
-AND THAT IS ME TAKING

38:19.775 --> 38:21.560
THE ONLY WEAPON
THAT CAN KILL YOU

38:21.603 --> 38:23.039
OFF THE TABLE.

38:28.654 --> 38:30.569
BEFORE WE GET TOO COCKY...

38:43.669 --> 38:47.890
NO MORE SECRETS,
NOT BETWEEN US

38:47.934 --> 38:49.675
AND NOT AFTER TODAY.

39:00.990 --> 39:03.036
-WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
-THE SAME WAY BRUCE DID.

39:05.168 --> 39:06.648
A FRIEND GAVE IT TO ME
FOR SAFEKEEPING

39:06.692 --> 39:09.347
IN CASE SHE EVER
LOST HER WAY.

39:09.390 --> 39:11.349
AND YOU'RE JUST TELLING
US ABOUT IT NOW BECAUSE...

39:11.392 --> 39:12.828
I HONESTLY DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D FIGURE OUT

39:12.872 --> 39:14.613
-A WAY TO DESTROY IT.
-WELL, WE DID,

39:14.656 --> 39:16.092
SO HAND IT OVER.

39:16.136 --> 39:18.181
AND BECAUSE I CAN'T.

39:18.225 --> 39:19.748
IT'S NOT MINE
TO DESTROY.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.663
KATE, IF THAT GETS
INTO THE WRONG HANDS,

39:21.707 --> 39:23.143
IT'LL KILL YOU.

39:23.186 --> 39:25.232
I PROMISED MY FRIEND
I WOULD KEEP IT,

39:25.275 --> 39:27.756
AND SHE TRUSTS ME,

39:27.800 --> 39:30.324
AND UNTIL I CAN TALK
TO HER ABOUT IT,

39:30.368 --> 39:33.022
I NEED YOU GUYS
TO TRUST ME, TOO.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.739
-COME.
-SIR.

39:53.782 --> 39:55.393
THOUGHT THESE
MIGHT INTEREST YOU.

39:55.436 --> 39:57.220
COLLECTED THEM
FROM THE ARENA.

40:02.878 --> 40:04.663
THAT IN PARTICULAR
IS A SLUG

40:04.706 --> 40:08.231
FROM A DESERT EAGLE.

40:08.275 --> 40:10.843
A DESERT EAGLE CAN
SHOOT THROUGH ANYTHING.

40:10.886 --> 40:14.107
WELL, ALMOST ANYTHING, SIR.

40:17.763 --> 40:20.505
THEN WE'RE GONNA
NEED TO FIND
SOMETHING STRONGER.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.558
I MUST ADMIT, TOMMY.

40:30.602 --> 40:32.081
I FIND YOU TO BE
ONE OF THE MOST

40:32.125 --> 40:34.780
LOATHSOME MEN
IN GOTHAM.

40:34.823 --> 40:37.870
VAIN AND UNCOUTH,

40:37.913 --> 40:40.916
HUMORLESS AND DULL.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.049
I PITY ANY WOMAN
WHO CONFUSES THE BUZZ

40:43.092 --> 40:45.834
OF HER MARTINI
WITH YOUR CHARMS.

40:49.708 --> 40:52.928
AND YET HERE YOU ARE.

40:52.972 --> 40:55.975
HMM. MY MASTERPIECE.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.601
WHAT DID YOU DO?

41:13.645 --> 41:16.474
I MADE ALL YOUR DREAMS
COME TRUE.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.392
I LOOK LIKE
BRUCE WAYNE.

41:26.832 --> 41:28.790
YOU MADE ME BRUCE WAYNE.

41:28.834 --> 41:33.969
SO, MY RICH,
HANDSOME,

41:34.013 --> 41:37.538
BELOVED BRUCE,

41:37.582 --> 41:39.540
I NEED YOU TO STRUT
THROUGH THE DOORS

41:39.584 --> 41:41.716
OF WAYNE TOWER
AND GET ME THAT SHARD
OF KRYPTONITE

41:41.760 --> 41:45.764
FROM YOUR DEAR
COUSIN KATE, HMM?

42:16.098 --> 42:17.796
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
