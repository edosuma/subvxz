there's some whiskey in here?

14:33.845 --> 14:35.848

14:38.171 --> 14:39.473
How fucking dare
you bring her here?

14:39.572 --> 14:40.614
- How was I supposed
to know you're going to be here?

14:40.694 --> 14:42.696
You don't fucking work here!

14:44.619 --> 14:46.562
You said you were
done with me.

14:46.662 --> 14:48.665

14:56.754 --> 14:58.898
Not even a little.

14:58.998 --> 15:00.999

15:01.961 --> 15:05.306
You said that if I left
we were through. I left.

15:05.406 --> 15:06.748
And I met her.

15:06.848 --> 15:10.032
And I...
I fell in love.

15:10.132 --> 15:12.075
And when I had to leave there
and come back here

15:12.175 --> 15:15.038
she chose an option that
you and I didn't discuss:

15:15.138 --> 15:17.141
she chose to come with me.

15:17.981 --> 15:19.985
- So, it's my fault?

15:21.747 --> 15:23.749
- It's nobody's fault.

15:24.230 --> 15:25.812
I had a lot of growing up to do.

15:25.912 --> 15:28.034
I wish that I'd done it before
you and I met, but I didn't.

15:34.724 --> 15:36.867
Just forget everything that's
happened before right now.

15:36.965 --> 15:38.869
All right. Choose.

that blanket off him?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.354
- Nah.

17:01.796 --> 17:04.779
You know, I've never figured
out a way to look at one

17:04.879 --> 17:06.963
and know if it had
a shred of talent or heart.

17:08.485 --> 17:11.308
But if you look
at all this horse has done,

17:11.408 --> 17:13.409

17:15.213 --> 17:18.137
I guess that's what
talent and heart looks like.

here in the four sixes truck.

17:26.507 --> 17:28.771
- Uh, yes, sir.

17:28.871 --> 17:30.871
My fiancée'll drive it back
with her when she goes.

17:32.555 --> 17:34.558
- Fiancée.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.622
- Yes, sir.

17:37.722 --> 17:39.665

17:39.764 --> 17:43.029
Now the fiancée's gonna
drive back

17:43.129 --> 17:45.492
and you're not going with her?

17:47.295 --> 17:49.677

what I owe you.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.780
Then we'll figure it out.

17:52.661 --> 17:57.288

be in, what, 75 years?

to stay with her.

No, I'm going to pay you
what I owe.

is yourself, Jim.

Texas that long.

off and become a cowboy.

People of the land,
I guess you could say...

23:06.784 --> 23:08.487
They don't expect you.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.409
They don't expect a fight.

23:10.511 --> 23:12.013
That's why you have been

23:12.112 --> 23:15.077

nuisance for so long.

of just what a huge problem

23:20.563 --> 23:22.587

I was prepared...

23:22.687 --> 23:25.991
I gave you enough rope
to hang yourself,

23:26.091 --> 23:29.155
and oh boy did you
fucking hang yourself.

You have violated everything

23:33.581 --> 23:36.324

You have committed
corporate espionage.

anything about that.

with which you lie.

25:40.304 --> 25:42.967
- John.

25:43.067 --> 25:44.409

- You walk pretty good
for a man who got shot.

25:47.351 --> 25:50.016
I play eighteen holes,
I can't walk for a month.

25:50.117 --> 25:52.119
- Well, it's been
a few months now.

Have a seat.

25:57.805 --> 25:59.809
What can I do for you?

26:01.291 --> 26:04.215
- I wanna talk about
this Summer Higgins case.

26:06.057 --> 26:07.639
- You know her?

26:07.738 --> 26:09.762
- Little bit.

26:09.862 --> 26:11.804
From what I know
she's not a criminal.

26:11.905 --> 26:14.088
Overly passionate, maybe...

26:14.188 --> 26:17.651
- John, she's an
environmental terrorist.

26:17.752 --> 26:20.416
Forty-two arrests
in a dozen states.

26:20.516 --> 26:22.538
I've put many an
armed robber in prison,

26:22.638 --> 26:24.982
they're equally as passionate
about their position.

26:25.081 --> 26:27.425
But because these people
think that their cause

26:27.525 --> 26:29.266
has some moral high ground

26:29.367 --> 26:31.270
they think the laws
don't apply to them.

26:31.370 --> 26:33.592
But the laws
they break are still broken.

26:33.693 --> 26:34.994
An officer was still assaulted,

26:35.092 --> 26:37.036
land was still vandalised,

26:37.137 --> 26:39.320
and property was
still destroyed.

26:39.420 --> 26:41.963
My obligation is
to the rule of law,

26:42.063 --> 26:44.086
which is eroding everywhere.

26:44.186 --> 26:47.650
Not here.
Not on my watch.

to send her to prison

26:49.473 --> 26:51.014
for the rest of her life?

26:51.115 --> 26:54.860

sides to ignore her motivation,

26:54.959 --> 26:57.223

26:57.322 --> 26:59.326
and bring me a plea
agreement with some weight.

27:02.129 --> 27:04.432
But you speaking
on her behalf has weight too,

27:04.532 --> 27:06.534
and I'll take it
into consideration.

27:10.019 --> 27:12.022
- I appreciate it, Mitch.

27:13.184 --> 27:15.907
- John, I want to be clear:

27:17.949 --> 27:19.952
she is going to prison.

36:55.634 --> 36:57.636
We aren't fucking Catholic.

you happy, I'm happy.

- Look, I'm just sayin'
it's not chili.

37:41.292 --> 37:43.797
- It's chili.
- It's got beans in it.

37:43.897 --> 37:45.559
- The whole point of chili
is to use up all the shit

37:45.658 --> 37:47.020
you got in you kitchen, you can
put anything you want in it.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.363

37:48.462 --> 37:50.524
As soon as you put beans
in chili it ain't chili.

37:50.625 --> 37:52.047
- Then what the fuck
do they call this in Texas?

37:52.147 --> 37:53.509
- They don't call it anything
because it doesn't exist,

37:53.589 --> 37:54.490
it's got beans in it.

37:54.590 --> 37:56.133
- They don't eat beans in Texas.

37:56.233 --> 37:57.594
- They eat beans all day they
just don't eat them in chili.

37:57.674 --> 37:59.337
- So why the fuck does
Texas get to decide

37:59.437 --> 38:01.179
what the fuck goes in chili?
- Uh, 'cause they invented it.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.980
- Will y'all shut the fuck up?

38:03.081 --> 38:05.224

the fuck you call it

it's just not chili.

Grab your stuff, will you?

38:11.973 --> 38:13.114
- Hey, Rip, will you tell them?

38:13.214 --> 38:14.136
If you put beans in chili,
is it still chili?

38:14.216 --> 38:15.437
- Jimmy, shut the fuck up.

38:15.537 --> 38:17.520
Nobody cares about
your goddamn chili.

You still owe me a rope.

- But I got to tell you...

38:22.667 --> 38:27.212
This is some damn good chili.

38:27.313 --> 38:29.335
- You know, when your mom
makes chili, no beans.

38:29.435 --> 38:30.777
- Don't start this shit again.

38:30.877 --> 38:32.578
- Actually, I feel really bad,
I should have said something

38:32.679 --> 38:34.301
before we came.

38:34.402 --> 38:35.122
I had a very, very brief
relationship

38:35.203 --> 38:36.424
with Colby's mother.

38:36.524 --> 38:37.946
- Here we go!

At least not for me.
I can't speak for her.

38:40.288 --> 38:41.831

come across this table.

38:44.334 --> 38:45.515
Although it's crazy
you would say that,

38:45.616 --> 38:47.078
'cause that's exactly what
I did with your mom.

- That's it!

everything ass backwards, buddy.

39:12.411 --> 39:14.413
any of the shit I'm planning.

You can stand here.

39:21.102 --> 39:23.846

that dress at your wedding.

I won't be wearing it long.

39:52.062 --> 39:53.444

our conversations going forward?

this again for you.

40:15.252 --> 40:17.254
And do it right.

40:34.355 --> 40:37.480
- Me. I'm--I'm her father.

things about the couple,

40:51.819 --> 40:54.843
but I don't have any
idea who you people are,

40:54.943 --> 40:57.626

onward to the vows.

wedded bride.

lawful wedded bride.

to honour and cherish,

for richer or poorer,

41:23.580 --> 41:28.806
in sickness and in health,
until death do us part.

to cherish through
everything...

41:35.875 --> 41:38.038
until I die.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.603
And then somehow longer, baby.

And don't worry,
I won't press charges.

42:47.727 --> 42:49.390

42:49.490 --> 42:51.493
- Sorry, Daddy.
I had to kidnap him.

- If I could get a ride
back to my church,

42:55.096 --> 42:57.600
I would appreciate it.
- Hold on. Hold on...

42:57.700 --> 43:00.805
How exactly did she kidnap you?

43:00.904 --> 43:03.629
- Pistol.

44:57.696 --> 44:59.698
[groans]

45:23.809 --> 45:25.812
- Give me eyes up top.

45:29.296 --> 45:32.120
Knight 33, this is Bravo One.

45:32.220 --> 45:33.841
Be advised,
the beacon is in place.

45:33.941 --> 45:35.944
[explosion]

45:36.546 --> 45:38.548
[sobbing, gunfire]

46:06.504 --> 46:09.247
[explosion]

46:09.346 --> 46:11.350
[music]

46:11.830 --> 46:14.874
[muted explosions]

46:19.441 --> 46:21.443
[muted gunfire]

46:37.303 --> 46:39.307
[screaming]

46:45.475 --> 46:49.238
[wolves howling]

46:58.490 --> 47:02.135
[panting]

47:04.057 --> 47:09.163
[wolves continue howling]

47:09.265 --> 47:14.551
[music]

47:37.461 --> 47:38.562
- Thank you for coming.

47:38.662 --> 47:39.885
Did you talk to the judge?

47:39.984 --> 47:41.836
- We talked.
- And?

47:41.846 --> 47:43.069
- And he listened.

47:43.169 --> 47:44.750
We're about to find
out how much.

47:44.850 --> 47:46.854
- All rise.

47:50.178 --> 47:51.839
The state of Montana
vs. Summer Higgins,

47:51.939 --> 47:53.942
Judge Mitchell
Davis presiding.

47:56.787 --> 47:59.330
- Be seated.

47:59.430 --> 48:02.134
At the arraignment, your client
issued a plea of not guilty.

48:02.234 --> 48:03.615
Does your client wish
to change her plea?

48:03.714 --> 48:05.258
- She does your honour.

48:05.357 --> 48:06.399
- If it please the court,
may council approach?

48:06.479 --> 48:08.482
- Council may approach.

48:12.926 --> 48:14.269
- They're entering
your plea agreement now.

48:14.368 --> 48:17.633
The judge will ask you
to reverse your plea.

48:17.732 --> 48:20.037
Once you do that, you are
at the mercy of the court.

48:20.136 --> 48:22.239
- No, we agreed
to a suspended sentence--

48:22.339 --> 48:26.004
- No, your attorneys agreed.
Not the judge.

48:26.104 --> 48:28.107
The judge does
not have to honour it.

48:31.390 --> 48:33.394
- What should I do?

48:34.355 --> 48:36.457
- Summer, I...

48:36.558 --> 48:38.941
I trust a jury
more than I trust the judge.

48:39.040 --> 48:41.044
- Will the defendant
please rise?

48:43.647 --> 48:46.230
Council has presented the court
with a plea agreement.

48:46.330 --> 48:48.232
Are you aware of this agreement?

48:48.332 --> 48:49.915
- I am your honour.

48:50.015 --> 48:52.018
- Do you wish to change
your plea to guilty?

48:54.421 --> 48:56.163
- I do, your honour.

48:56.263 --> 48:58.366
- Your plea is changed
to a plea of guilty.

48:58.466 --> 49:01.450
In exchange for your plea
the State is offering

49:01.549 --> 49:03.812
a fifteen year
suspended sentence

49:03.913 --> 49:05.335
and a ten thousand dollar fine.

49:05.435 --> 49:06.656
Are you aware
of this plea offer?

49:06.756 --> 49:08.759
- I am, your honour.

49:14.846 --> 49:19.232
- When imposing a sentence,
this court must consider

49:19.332 --> 49:22.236
many factors, motive
being one of them.

49:22.337 --> 49:24.919
Many courts in the past
have confused your intentions

49:25.020 --> 49:26.843
with motive.

49:26.942 --> 49:31.167
Your intention, Miss Higgins,
may be to affect policy change,

49:31.268 --> 49:34.812
or bring awareness to issues.

49:34.913 --> 49:37.817
But that is not your motive.

49:37.917 --> 49:39.739
That is not your motive
when you throw rocks

49:39.839 --> 49:41.461
and frozen water bottles.

49:41.560 --> 49:45.747
When you damage private property
and defy lawful orders.

49:45.846 --> 49:50.913
Your motive then
is to destroy and disrupt.

49:51.013 --> 49:56.000
And the result of that is
the erosion of the rule of law.

49:56.100 --> 49:59.524
When courts dismiss
your unlawful acts

49:59.625 --> 50:02.848
they are weakening
the rule of law,

50:02.948 --> 50:05.252
and creating avenues
of opportunity

50:05.352 --> 50:10.779
for people whose sole intent
is theft and violence.

50:10.879 --> 50:14.223
And they prey on the most
vulnerable in our society.

50:14.323 --> 50:19.069
The elderly, the young,
the weak, the poor.

50:19.169 --> 50:22.282
They prey on those least likely
to recover from the attack.

50:22.292 --> 50:25.478
And you, Miss Higgins,
pave the way for them.

50:25.578 --> 50:28.362
I am not swayed by
your college education

50:28.462 --> 50:30.203
and your outreach work
in the community,

50:30.304 --> 50:32.407
in fact the opposite.

50:32.506 --> 50:34.448
You know better.

50:34.550 --> 50:36.693
If you wish to change laws,

50:36.792 --> 50:40.216
run for office or vote for those
who wish to change them as well.

50:40.317 --> 50:45.944
I look at your file
and I see a career criminal,

50:46.045 --> 50:48.426
who has deluded herself
into believing

50:48.527 --> 50:49.750
that she is not
a criminal

50:49.849 --> 50:51.992
because she believes
she is right.

50:52.091 --> 50:55.277
And you may be right,
Miss Higgins,

50:55.376 --> 50:57.880
But that does not exempt
you from the laws

50:57.980 --> 50:59.801
of this state and this nation.

50:59.902 --> 51:02.846
For the two counts of
assault on a peace officer,

51:02.947 --> 51:05.889
I am sentencing you to
fifteen years per offence.

51:05.989 --> 51:07.813
For the charge of defying
a lawful order

51:07.913 --> 51:09.375
I am sentencing you to one year,

51:09.474 --> 51:11.377
for the charge of
reckless endangerment

51:11.478 --> 51:13.219
I am sentencing you
to 18 months,

51:13.319 --> 51:14.942
and for the charge of
criminal trespass,

51:15.041 --> 51:17.064
because you are an
habitual offender,

51:17.165 --> 51:21.429
I am sentencing you to
the maximum of five years.

51:21.529 --> 51:24.795
If you are a model inmate
who treats the rules of prison

51:24.895 --> 51:28.279
with more respect
than you treat our laws,

51:28.377 --> 51:31.282
you will be eligible for
parole in fourteen years.

51:31.381 --> 51:33.404
Bailiff, place the
inmate in custody.

51:33.505 --> 51:35.167
- Wait, what?

51:35.268 --> 51:37.810
I'm trying to make
the world a better place

51:37.911 --> 51:39.614
and you're taking my life?

51:39.712 --> 51:42.015
- All rise.
- You're taking away my life?

51:42.117 --> 51:43.497
What's happening?
What's happening?

51:43.599 --> 51:46.261
- Summer, Summer, look at me.
Look at me.

51:46.362 --> 51:47.984
Stop crying. Okay?

51:48.085 --> 51:49.666
You have a new fight now.
Be ready for it.

51:49.765 --> 51:52.991
Lawyer: We're going to appeal
this in the morning.
- Hey.

51:53.090 --> 51:55.313
- Sir, you can't
touch the inmate.

51:55.413 --> 51:57.237
- It's her last fucking hug.

51:57.337 --> 51:59.337
Let her have it.

52:01.702 --> 52:04.206
Get your mind right.

52:04.306 --> 52:07.529
It's a long fight
and it starts now.

52:07.630 --> 52:09.631
[music]

52:28.935 --> 52:30.518
- God damn, Mitch.

52:30.618 --> 52:32.282
- Who the fuck do you think you
are marching in this office?

52:32.381 --> 52:33.603
- What in the world
was that about?

52:33.703 --> 52:36.808
- You will knock before you
enter these chambers

52:36.907 --> 52:38.247
or a bailiff will
drag you out.

52:38.349 --> 52:40.350
[knocks]

52:42.953 --> 52:45.018
- You think justice
was served today?

52:45.117 --> 52:47.181
- It was harsh, but it was just.

52:47.279 --> 52:49.823
- Six months of cleaning
toilets in county jail

52:49.924 --> 52:51.907
is harsh, what you did
was fucking cruel.

52:52.006 --> 52:53.828
- It is a necessary
message to send.

52:53.929 --> 52:55.270
- What's the message, Mitch:

52:55.371 --> 52:57.715
fuck with me and I'll put you
in prison 'til

52:57.814 --> 52:59.556
you're too fucking old
to have children?!

52:59.657 --> 53:03.202
Or a goddam career?
Or any life at all?

53:03.301 --> 53:04.724
- I followed the letter
of the law.

53:04.823 --> 53:07.166
- For fuck's sake.

53:07.265 --> 53:08.929
She's a woman who pushed
a full-grown man.

53:09.029 --> 53:10.210
The law?

53:10.310 --> 53:12.493
You know...

53:12.594 --> 53:15.376
there is a difference between
what's legal and what's just.

53:15.475 --> 53:18.621
- Not to me, there isn't.

53:18.721 --> 53:22.786
There is the law and there
is the law and that is it.

53:22.886 --> 53:26.591
- Well, I got bad news for you:
that is the future out there.

53:26.692 --> 53:27.993
That is your voting base.

53:28.094 --> 53:29.514
And you just told them
to go fuck themselves.

53:29.614 --> 53:31.438
- You got it backwards, John.

53:31.538 --> 53:33.541
That's what they're telling us.

53:36.582 --> 53:38.587
- Get me one of those.

53:47.559 --> 53:49.862
We're losing this place.

53:49.962 --> 53:51.962
And every year
it happens faster.

53:52.645 --> 53:54.386
- I know.

53:54.487 --> 53:56.489
I'm trying to stop it.

53:57.371 --> 53:59.372
- I don't think it
can be stopped.

54:03.018 --> 54:05.962
Here's what's going to happen.

54:06.060 --> 54:08.323
Charlotte's going
to appeal the sentence.

54:08.425 --> 54:09.765
You will suspend
the felony assaults--

54:09.867 --> 54:10.809
- I won't.

54:10.908 --> 54:13.612
- You made your point.

54:13.712 --> 54:16.014
Now show some goddam mercy.

54:16.114 --> 54:18.538
Suspend the felony assaults,

54:18.639 --> 54:22.344
reduce the trespass to a year,
you can keep all the others.

54:22.444 --> 54:23.864
- She'll be out in eight months.

54:23.965 --> 54:26.728
- Yeah, yeah, eight months of hell.

54:28.130 --> 54:30.353
- [scoffs]

54:30.453 --> 54:32.456
So this is it, huh?

54:33.818 --> 54:35.158
The pound of flesh?

54:35.260 --> 54:37.402
- It's the right thing to do.

54:37.502 --> 54:42.328
- Right barely factors
into it anymore, John.

54:42.429 --> 54:45.413
The cancer of entitlement
is eating everything.

54:45.511 --> 54:47.515
I just snip away
at the symptom.

54:51.161 --> 54:54.103
Have her file
the appeal on Friday.

54:54.203 --> 54:55.706
I don't want it
on the court record

54:55.806 --> 54:57.809
I changed the sentence
after one day.

54:59.331 --> 55:01.332
- Friday it is.

55:03.697 --> 55:05.698
- I look at my grandchildren...

55:07.462 --> 55:09.823
and I am terrified of the
world we are leaving them.

55:11.265 --> 55:13.087
I honestly have no
idea what this place

55:13.188 --> 55:15.189
will even look like in
a hundred years.

55:16.591 --> 55:18.855
- Grass will cover the streets

55:18.956 --> 55:21.819
and weeds will
cover the rooftops.

55:21.920 --> 55:23.922
I don't think we make
it a hundred years.

55:25.082 --> 55:27.087
Then God starts over.

55:28.969 --> 55:32.353
Tries again,
if he's got the stomach for it.

55:32.453 --> 55:35.697
[music]

55:44.188 --> 55:45.569
- You have a visitor.

55:45.670 --> 55:46.973
- I don't have an appointment.

55:47.072 --> 55:49.154
- Not an appointment.
A visitor.

55:51.358 --> 55:53.359
- A visitor.

56:04.573 --> 56:06.578
- I wanted to share
the good news.

56:09.862 --> 56:11.864
He made an honest woman of me.

56:20.395 --> 56:22.398
- Congratulations.

56:23.760 --> 56:25.761
- Thank you.

56:26.603 --> 56:28.605
- What do you want?

56:29.808 --> 56:32.270
- I knew it was you.

56:32.371 --> 56:34.032
- I'm not playing
this game again.

56:34.131 --> 56:36.194
- It's not a game, Jamie.

56:36.295 --> 56:38.518
Hey, on that fancy computer

56:38.618 --> 56:40.661
log onto the Bureau
of Prisons website, would you?

56:42.502 --> 56:46.207
You do have access to that?

56:46.309 --> 56:49.372
I was always
the computer whiz,

56:49.473 --> 56:51.475
let me have a crack at it.

56:52.435 --> 56:53.739
Move over.

56:53.837 --> 56:56.801
- Get away from my--
Ow!

56:58.764 --> 57:03.550
[music]

57:03.649 --> 57:05.792
- I have done everything
I need to do

57:05.893 --> 57:07.837
to never see
this world again, Jamie.

57:07.935 --> 57:10.279
I am prepared.

57:10.380 --> 57:12.643
I will ruin my life today.

57:12.742 --> 57:14.444
And I swear to God
I will fucking kill you

57:14.545 --> 57:16.547
so just sit down
and let me do it.

57:29.243 --> 57:30.786
[grunts]

57:30.886 --> 57:34.471
Auto fill on the passwords?

57:34.569 --> 57:35.953
[snorts]

57:36.051 --> 57:37.514
Good for you, Jamie.

57:37.614 --> 57:40.136
Way to keep the computer
system secure.

57:46.867 --> 57:48.868
Have a look.

57:52.073 --> 57:54.024
- If you saw him,
then you know it wasn't me.

57:54.035 --> 57:55.457
- That's not what he said.

57:55.557 --> 57:56.459
- Well, he's fucking lying.

57:56.560 --> 57:58.261
- You saw him in the prison.

57:58.361 --> 57:59.403
- I went to see him
in the prison to find out

57:59.482 --> 58:01.185
if my father
was fucking involved.

58:01.285 --> 58:03.287
- Was he?

58:06.292 --> 58:08.555
- I had no idea. None.

58:08.654 --> 58:11.959
He only admitted it once I held
a fucking gun to his head.

58:12.060 --> 58:14.462
- And when he did admit it why
didn't you blow his head off?

58:16.667 --> 58:18.669
- I was...he's...

58:20.350 --> 58:22.352
- I'll tell you why.

58:24.234 --> 58:27.118
Because deep down in here
it's what you always wanted.

58:29.801 --> 58:33.948
I'm sure he told you that he did
it 'cause he loves you, right?

58:34.048 --> 58:37.471
He loves you, Jamie.

58:37.571 --> 58:41.156
And he wants the best for you,
and all the things you deserve,

58:41.256 --> 58:44.522
but that's just not
the truth, is it?

58:44.622 --> 58:47.245
He just wants what you want.

58:47.345 --> 58:51.009
He wants what everyone
who has ever attacked us wants:

58:51.109 --> 58:53.111
he wants the land.

58:55.676 --> 58:59.461
Option one: I tell my father.

58:59.560 --> 59:02.343
He will call the Governor and
he will have you both arrested.

59:02.442 --> 59:06.549
Your spineless,
woman-murdering father

59:06.649 --> 59:08.692
will instantly say
it was your idea.

59:10.133 --> 59:12.037
You know that, right?

59:12.136 --> 59:17.163
He will cut an immunity deal
and he will testify against you.

59:17.263 --> 59:21.089
You will be charged with
attempted murder times three

59:21.189 --> 59:24.573
and will spend the rest
of your life in jail,

59:24.673 --> 59:26.254

And then I'll tell my husband...

59:56.955 --> 1:00:00.678
that you had his child
cut from my belly

1:00:03.763 --> 1:00:07.067
and then you had me sterilised,

1:00:07.167 --> 1:00:10.252
so he can never have
a family of his own.

1:00:11.493 --> 1:00:15.399
And you, no matter
where you hide,

1:00:15.499 --> 1:00:17.480
he will find you

1:00:17.580 --> 1:00:20.725

think "real" means.

1:01:27.430 --> 1:01:29.433
- I don't know you.

1:01:29.874 --> 1:01:31.877

1:02:59.549 --> 1:03:01.551
