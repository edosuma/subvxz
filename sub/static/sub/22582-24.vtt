00:08.927 --> 00:12.363
It could be a phantom reading,
background radiation.

00:15.527 --> 00:18.599
Even your scientists have confirmed
the existence of dark matter.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.719
- Never in such dense concentrations.
- That's the point.

00:22.087 --> 00:26.365
If it really is a dark matter nebula,
we'd be the first to directly observe one.

00:26.967 --> 00:30.676
Even with modified sensors
there wouldn't be much to see.

00:30.887 --> 00:34.516
I've heard of Vulcan experiments where
they were able to excite dark matter...

00:34.647 --> 00:36.717
by bombarding it with metreon particles.

00:36.847 --> 00:39.281
Those tests involved
very small quantities.

00:39.447 --> 00:43.156
This structure is nearly
10 million kilometres in diameter.

00:44.287 --> 00:46.847
Could you rig some kind of
spatial charges?

00:46.967 --> 00:49.925
Something that'd spread the metreon
particles over a wider area?

00:50.047 --> 00:52.641
If I can, it should put on
a hell of a show.

00:52.767 --> 00:55.406
Sorry to interrupt, Captain.
It's Admiral Forrest.

00:55.527 --> 00:58.041
- Get to work on those charges.
- Aye, Captain.

01:02.007 --> 01:03.759
This is good timing, Admiral.

01:03.887 --> 01:06.720
We just picked up some
very interesting sensor readings.

01:06.847 --> 01:09.202
I'm afraid I've got some bad news, Jon.

01:10.447 --> 01:12.039
It's A.G.

01:12.727 --> 01:17.084
He was back on Mount McKinley.
There was an accident...

01:17.927 --> 01:19.645
He was killed.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.726
I'm sorry.

01:28.967 --> 01:31.527
It's been a long road

01:33.207 --> 01:35.243
Gettin' from there to here

01:36.367 --> 01:39.165
It's been a long time

01:39.967 --> 01:43.437
But my time is finally near

01:43.927 --> 01:47.317
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:48.127 --> 01:50.960
I will touch the sky

01:51.367 --> 01:54.962
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:55.127 --> 01:58.119
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:58.247 --> 02:02.525
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:02.687 --> 02:05.759
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:05.887 --> 02:10.038
I've got faith to believe

02:10.167 --> 02:13.125
I can do anything

02:13.247 --> 02:16.922
I've got strength of the soul

02:17.567 --> 02:20.559
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:20.687 --> 02:24.885
I can reach any star

02:26.047 --> 02:28.038
I've got faith

02:29.967 --> 02:33.084
I've got faith

02:33.567 --> 02:36.843
Faith of the heart

02:38.000 --> 02:44.074

02:57.367 --> 02:59.756
You've got six spatial charges.
I rigged them myself.

03:01.287 --> 03:02.481
What are their ranges?

03:02.607 --> 03:06.077
If there's any dark matter
within 500 kilometres, you'll know it.

03:07.367 --> 03:08.641
Thanks.

03:10.167 --> 03:12.397
You sure you don't
want some company?

03:12.967 --> 03:14.036
If this nebula exists...

03:14.167 --> 03:16.806
we don't know what effect it could have
on the shuttlepod.

03:16.927 --> 03:19.646
All the more reason to
bring your engineer along.

03:21.087 --> 03:22.884
Not this time, Trip.

03:24.847 --> 03:26.803
I still can't believe it.

03:29.887 --> 03:32.959
All the close calls he had
flying warp trials...

03:34.927 --> 03:38.363
and he gets himself killed
climbing Mount McKinley.

03:58.127 --> 03:59.924
I've brought some
sensor enhancements.

04:00.047 --> 04:01.002
Thanks.

04:01.127 --> 04:04.403
We'll find them useful
in mapping the nebula, if it's there.

04:05.007 --> 04:06.122
We?

04:06.727 --> 04:09.799
This is a scientific mission.
It's only logical to bring your...

04:09.927 --> 04:11.519
Science Officer.

04:11.927 --> 04:13.997
I'd prefer to handle this myself.

04:14.127 --> 04:18.757
Commander Tucker obviously didn't
remind you that Starfleet regulations...

04:18.927 --> 04:22.715
prohibit the captain from
leaving the ship unaccompanied.

04:49.447 --> 04:51.403
We should reach the edge
of the phenomenon...

04:51.527 --> 04:53.199
in two hours, 46 minutes.

04:58.607 --> 05:01.599
I can pass the time by meditating,
but if you prefer to talk...

05:01.727 --> 05:03.524
Go ahead and meditate.

05:06.087 --> 05:08.317
Would you like to join me?

05:09.047 --> 05:12.244
You seemed quite unsettled
since your call from Admiral Forrest.

05:12.367 --> 05:13.686
I'm fine.

05:15.807 --> 05:18.196
Commander Tucker was reluctant to
discuss it as well...

05:18.327 --> 05:21.797
though he did mention
an old colleague had died.

05:23.527 --> 05:26.883
A Starfleet captain, A.G. Robinson.

05:29.487 --> 05:32.001
I wouldn't be out here
if it weren't for him.

05:32.207 --> 05:35.279
I'm somewhat familiar
with Starfleet history.

05:35.487 --> 05:38.160
I've never heard of a Captain Robinson.

05:38.607 --> 05:42.236
I'm sure there's a paragraph about him
in the Vulcan database.

05:49.847 --> 05:52.407
We were in the NX-Test Program...

05:53.727 --> 05:55.957
trying to break the warp 2 barrier.

05:56.447 --> 05:58.756
There were just a few of us...

06:00.727 --> 06:04.117
Gardener, Duvall, A.G. And me.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.561
And we all wanted the first flight.

06:09.727 --> 06:12.924
And I was cocky enough to think
I'd be the one to get it.

06:16.287 --> 06:17.481
Come in.

06:17.887 --> 06:20.720
Sorry I'm late, Commodore.
I came straight from the Testbay.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.280
At ease, Commander.

06:22.567 --> 06:25.320
I heard you got the warp reactor
up to 90% today.

06:25.447 --> 06:26.562
92%.

06:28.727 --> 06:29.876
Sir...

06:30.607 --> 06:33.485
you didn't call me here
to ask about an engine test.

06:34.807 --> 06:37.685
We all know the assignment's about
to be handed out.

06:37.887 --> 06:40.640
I'm guessing this is either
really good news, or...

06:40.767 --> 06:42.678
We're going with
Commander Robinson.

06:45.007 --> 06:46.725
A.G.'s a fine pilot.

06:48.327 --> 06:52.400
It wasn't an easy decision.
You'll be backup.

06:52.927 --> 06:54.360
Sounds good.

06:55.327 --> 06:58.444
You know, I spent more time
in the simulator than anyone.

06:58.567 --> 07:01.001
If I can do anything to help A.G.
Prepare for the...

07:01.127 --> 07:02.242
Jon.

07:03.687 --> 07:07.600
It's your father's engine.
I know how important this was to you.

07:08.087 --> 07:10.840
The most important thing to me
is that we succeed.

07:12.967 --> 07:14.639
Is there anything else?

07:15.727 --> 07:18.116
No, Commander. Dismissed.

07:42.647 --> 07:44.126
Thanks, Ruby.

07:44.567 --> 07:45.886
You all right?

07:46.007 --> 07:47.326
Sure. Why?

07:47.487 --> 07:49.398
Last time you had this much to drink...

07:49.527 --> 07:51.643
was the day Caroline
moved to New Berlin.

07:51.767 --> 07:54.520
My guess is Forrest gave out
the assignment today.

07:55.887 --> 07:57.957
Sherlock Holmes has nothing on you.

07:59.407 --> 08:01.796
They'll need a pilot for the next flight.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.883
Do you remember what Buzz Aldrin said
when he stepped on the moon?

08:06.007 --> 08:07.042
No.

08:07.287 --> 08:10.404
Nobody does,
because Armstrong went first.

08:23.927 --> 08:25.246
Congratulations.

08:25.967 --> 08:28.242
- You mean that?
- Of course not.

08:28.767 --> 08:32.361
I'm waiting for Forrest to realise
what a horrible mistake he made.

08:33.126 --> 08:35.640
Until then, let me buy you a drink.

08:35.847 --> 08:39.522
No, I'll buy you one. A consolation prize.

08:40.167 --> 08:41.645
Two more, Leo.

08:45.847 --> 08:47.963
To Commander A.G. Robinson.

08:48.367 --> 08:52.246
We all worked hard to get this flight.
But in the end, the best pilot won.

08:52.407 --> 08:53.556
Just ask him.

08:54.887 --> 08:55.922
To A.G.

09:01.527 --> 09:04.599
Take it easy, Commander,
you're due in the simulator at 0700.

09:04.727 --> 09:07.287
First flight's in two weeks.

09:08.487 --> 09:11.001
You know why
you didn't get this assignment?

09:11.247 --> 09:13.283
I bet you're going to tell me.

09:13.407 --> 09:17.400
You tried too hard.
You did everything by the book.

09:17.687 --> 09:19.962
You burned the midnight oil
in that simulator.

09:20.087 --> 09:21.805
18, 20-hour days...

09:21.927 --> 09:24.236
You shut everything
and everyone out of your life...

09:24.367 --> 09:26.244
just so you could be the first.

09:26.367 --> 09:27.436
And?

09:27.647 --> 09:29.717
You still don't understand.

09:30.807 --> 09:33.275
Starfleet doesn't just want
a great pilot...

09:33.487 --> 09:35.478
they want a great captain.

09:45.487 --> 09:48.001
You said Captain Robinson
was a close friend.

09:48.247 --> 09:49.726
That's right.

09:49.847 --> 09:52.725
From what you've told me,
your relationship seemed...

09:53.007 --> 09:54.281
adversarial.

09:56.607 --> 09:59.838
Only one of us was going to
get to fly that ship.

10:00.447 --> 10:03.120
Nothing wrong with
a little healthy competition.

10:04.407 --> 10:06.045
He did have a point.

10:06.727 --> 10:10.356
It does take more than piloting ability
to command a Starship.

10:12.007 --> 10:13.201
I agree.

10:14.407 --> 10:18.366
Fortunately, you seem to have
developed the necessary skills.

10:18.887 --> 10:20.764
Was that a compliment?

10:21.487 --> 10:23.239
An observation.

10:24.607 --> 10:27.838
I assume Captain Robinson's flight
was successful?

10:28.047 --> 10:29.275
Not exactly.

10:30.567 --> 10:33.035
He was lucky to come out of it
in one piece.

10:35.847 --> 10:37.246
NX-Control...

10:37.367 --> 10:40.325
I thought we built a warp ship
so we could go to warp.

10:40.487 --> 10:43.524
Maintain your orbit. We're trying to
run down a problem with...

10:43.647 --> 10:45.717
the stabilisation protocols.

10:45.847 --> 10:47.963
I just saw Italy go by again.

10:48.087 --> 10:51.397
If this is going to take much longer
maybe you could send up some food.

10:51.527 --> 10:52.676
What can I get you?

10:52.807 --> 10:56.243
How about some of those deep-fried
mushrooms from the 602?

10:56.447 --> 10:58.324
I'll send Ruby up to take your order.

10:58.447 --> 11:00.915
We're clear on
the stabilisation protocols.

11:01.247 --> 11:03.602
We start countdown at 30 seconds.

11:03.727 --> 11:05.160
Good news, A.G.

11:05.287 --> 11:08.199
I just got word from the powers that be
that you're good to go.

11:08.327 --> 11:12.286
Acknowledged. WSP is nominal.

11:13.087 --> 11:15.237
APU's are good.

11:15.847 --> 11:18.680
Warp field initialisation in 20 seconds.

11:19.167 --> 11:20.919
I'm breaking orbit.

11:23.487 --> 11:25.842
At least the thrusters work.

11:26.127 --> 11:28.846
I did get a little variance on the RCS.

11:32.367 --> 11:34.005
We noticed that here.

11:35.567 --> 11:38.001
Do you want to bring her
back to the garage?

11:38.127 --> 11:39.719
Not on your life.

11:39.847 --> 11:42.122
We've got a stable warp field.

11:48.087 --> 11:50.647
NX-Control to NX-Alpha.

11:53.167 --> 11:55.203
You have permission to go to warp.

11:56.127 --> 11:58.207
See you in a few light-years.

12:06.887 --> 12:08.206
Warp 1.

12:11.447 --> 12:12.960
Warp 1.5.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.126
That little bump you just felt
was warp 2.

12:23.967 --> 12:28.006
Congratulations. Now let's see
if you can get it up to 2.1.

12:29.087 --> 12:30.964
She's getting a little shaky.

12:31.087 --> 12:34.204
Are you sure you got that
stabilisation problem ironed out?

12:34.327 --> 12:36.238
Field integrity's down to 20%.

12:36.367 --> 12:38.005
The warp field won't hold.

12:38.127 --> 12:41.324
A.G., we're getting some pretty unusual
telemetry down here.

12:41.887 --> 12:44.845
We need you to go sublight
until we get it sorted out.

12:47.967 --> 12:49.036
Did you hear me?

12:49.167 --> 12:52.125
I'm at warp 2. 1, and I think
I can get a little more out of her.

12:52.247 --> 12:53.760
Negative. Abort!

12:58.167 --> 13:00.078
Warp 2.15...

13:00.367 --> 13:03.677
This is Forrest. Drop to impulse.
That's an order!

13:11.767 --> 13:13.200
Warp 2.2.

13:19.487 --> 13:21.079
The field's collapsing!

13:21.207 --> 13:23.596
A.G., you've got to get out of there!

13:36.047 --> 13:37.799
We've lost telemetry.

13:39.047 --> 13:41.607
NX-Control to NX-Alpha, come in.

13:48.207 --> 13:49.606
A. G...

13:51.807 --> 13:53.240
can you hear me?

14:07.127 --> 14:08.845
Particle density is increasing.

14:08.967 --> 14:10.958
We should be entering the nebula.

14:11.087 --> 14:12.486
The readings could be misleading.

14:12.607 --> 14:16.156
As Dr Phlox would say... optimism.

14:18.367 --> 14:21.325
Optimism doesn't alter
the laws of physics.

14:24.487 --> 14:27.206
Time to put Trip's charges to the test.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.565
Three seconds.

14:42.927 --> 14:43.996
Anything?

14:51.847 --> 14:56.284
We need to move deeper
into the nebula... if it exists.

14:58.407 --> 14:59.886
What happened?

15:00.007 --> 15:03.283
The field emissions on the charges
could have been too low.

15:03.767 --> 15:06.281
Or maybe we're just on
a wild goose chase.

15:06.607 --> 15:10.646
I was referring to Captain Robinson.
His test flight.

15:13.087 --> 15:15.726
He made the record books
for being the first person to...

15:15.847 --> 15:18.042
deploy an escape pod at warp.

15:19.407 --> 15:22.001
But he lost one of two NX-prototypes.

15:22.127 --> 15:24.880
Nearly derailed the entire program.

15:32.207 --> 15:33.560
Are you all right?

15:34.247 --> 15:35.600
A little shaky.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.558
Trust me,
you don't want to pass through...

15:37.687 --> 15:39.723
the warp barrier in one of those.

15:39.887 --> 15:42.720
Should make a nice addition
to the Starfleet museum.

15:42.847 --> 15:45.156
- What went wrong?
- I'm not sure, sir.

15:45.447 --> 15:47.005
Closer I got to 2.2...

15:47.127 --> 15:49.243
the more trouble I had
keeping the field stable.

15:49.367 --> 15:51.278
You were ordered to abort.

15:52.007 --> 15:53.963
The abort call was premature.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.282
We had some instability
on the previous tests...

15:56.407 --> 15:57.965
but it always settled down.

15:58.087 --> 16:01.716
Your engine design is
obviously unsound.

16:02.207 --> 16:04.926
There's nothing wrong with that engine.

16:08.287 --> 16:11.006
You have something
to add, Lieutenant...

16:11.127 --> 16:14.005
Tucker, sir. I'm on
Captain Jefferies' engineering team.

16:14.127 --> 16:17.358
We've never pumped this much
antimatter through the injectors before.

16:17.487 --> 16:19.318
It'll take time to get the intermix right.

16:19.447 --> 16:21.324
That's precisely the point.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.117
Your program is moving too quickly.

16:24.247 --> 16:26.761
Just because it took you
100 years to crack warp 2...

16:26.887 --> 16:28.445
doesn't mean it'll take us that long.

16:28.567 --> 16:30.319
- Lieutenant!
- Sorry, sir.

16:32.807 --> 16:35.401
He's right. This is a new engine...

16:35.527 --> 16:37.916
it's bound to have
a few bugs to work out.

16:38.247 --> 16:42.843
Those bugs just scattered your ship
across 5,000 kilometres of space.

16:43.047 --> 16:45.003
And nearly killed your pilot.

16:45.127 --> 16:48.244
We're not going to get anywhere
without taking some risks.

16:48.367 --> 16:50.756
I know where you stand
on this, Commander.

16:51.007 --> 16:54.443
We've got a lot of data to analyse
before we know what happened.

16:54.767 --> 16:57.235
We should be grateful
we only lost the ship.

17:04.767 --> 17:05.915
Cyrus.

17:06.247 --> 17:07.362
Cyrus.

17:08.607 --> 17:11.758
- Who's Cyrus?
- It was my great-grandfather's name.

17:12.207 --> 17:14.800
- Keep trying, Tucker.
- Chester.

17:16.087 --> 17:18.601
How about Rosalie, if it's a girl?

17:19.527 --> 17:21.836
Come on, give me a hint.

17:22.926 --> 17:26.044
She's had names for her kids
picked out since she was 10.

17:26.807 --> 17:29.367
Says she'll marry
the first man to guess them.

17:30.047 --> 17:31.560
What's your name, Lieutenant?

17:31.687 --> 17:34.918
Charles Tucker, sir.
But, everybody calls me Trip.

17:35.047 --> 17:36.082
Trip?

17:36.207 --> 17:38.198
My dad's Charles Tucker,
and so was his dad.

17:38.327 --> 17:41.797
That makes me the third,
so, triple... Trip.

17:45.047 --> 17:48.960
Thanks for your help today
with our Vulcan friends, Trip.

17:49.927 --> 17:52.236
My father would have appreciated it.

17:55.927 --> 17:59.476
I don't get it.
It's like they want us to fail.

17:59.767 --> 18:03.043
I gave up trying to figure out
the Vulcans a long time ago.

18:03.367 --> 18:04.641
Commodore.

18:04.967 --> 18:06.116
At ease.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.202
May I?

18:08.767 --> 18:10.041
Of course.

18:21.687 --> 18:24.281
Can I buy you a drink, sir?

18:24.647 --> 18:27.445
It's the least you can do
after that outburst today.

18:27.567 --> 18:29.398
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to...

18:29.527 --> 18:31.643
I'll have a beer, Mr Tucker.

18:35.727 --> 18:38.241
It's been a while since I've been in here.

18:39.407 --> 18:41.602
I see it hasn't changed much.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.886
Is there something on your mind, sir?

18:47.207 --> 18:49.323
I came here to tell you...

18:51.447 --> 18:54.598
at the urging of
the Vulcan Advisory Council...

18:54.807 --> 18:59.164
that Starfleet Command has decided
to put the NX-Program on hold.

19:00.967 --> 19:02.366
For how long?

19:03.087 --> 19:04.566
Indefinitely.

19:06.447 --> 19:07.721
Gentlemen?

19:08.447 --> 19:09.675
One beer.

19:10.807 --> 19:12.957
What do you mean, indefinitely?

19:13.087 --> 19:15.237
They want to go back to
the drawing board, Jon...

19:15.367 --> 19:17.676
develop a new engine, from scratch.

19:17.887 --> 19:20.196
We have an engine that works now.

19:20.327 --> 19:23.319
If we start over, it'll be decades
before we get into deep space.

19:23.447 --> 19:25.677
Starfleet's made its decision.

19:28.127 --> 19:30.357
Permission to speak freely, sir?

19:34.367 --> 19:37.484
It's your father's engine, his life's work.

19:40.927 --> 19:42.963
You can't let them do this.

19:59.167 --> 20:01.123
Bourbon, straight up.

20:08.807 --> 20:10.525
I suppose you heard.

20:11.727 --> 20:14.878
This is really going to throw
a wrench in my career plans.

20:16.407 --> 20:17.396
Thanks.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.598
Last call. Anything else?

20:20.807 --> 20:22.445
I'll have another.

20:29.647 --> 20:31.478
Where have you been all day?

20:32.247 --> 20:35.557
Debriefing. After the flight surgeons
were done with me...

20:35.687 --> 20:39.316
I got hauled in front of the Starfleet
senior staff and the Vulcans.

20:40.087 --> 20:42.476
- What'd you tell them?
- What do you think?

20:43.367 --> 20:46.518
The subspace field destabilised
at warp 2.2.

20:46.647 --> 20:49.923
Primary flight controls failed,
resulting in the loss of the vehicle.

20:50.047 --> 20:52.322
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- What?

20:53.967 --> 20:56.197
The possibility of pilot error.

20:56.407 --> 20:58.682
I'm not interested in your opinion,
Lieutenant.

20:58.807 --> 20:59.842
You should be.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.435
The Vulcans have been leaning
on Starfleet for years...

21:02.567 --> 21:03.795
to rein in this program.

21:03.927 --> 21:05.679
You walked in, ruled out pilot error...

21:05.807 --> 21:07.718
and told them what
they wanted to hear:

21:07.847 --> 21:09.246
Our engine doesn't work.

21:09.367 --> 21:12.518
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news,
but it doesn't work.

21:12.847 --> 21:16.522
The engine's sound. We just need
more time to balance the intermix.

21:16.767 --> 21:19.327
- We need more than time.
- I agree.

21:19.567 --> 21:22.161
We need a pilot who listens to orders.

21:22.527 --> 21:25.917
If you'd aborted, we'd still have a ship,
and probably another chance.

21:26.047 --> 21:27.321
Another chance to get killed?

21:27.447 --> 21:29.802
First sign of trouble,
you should've throttled down.

21:29.927 --> 21:31.519
It wouldn't have made any difference.

21:31.647 --> 21:33.956
- We'll never find out.
- You weren't in that cockpit.

21:34.087 --> 21:35.440
Nothing's wrong with that ship!

21:35.567 --> 21:37.444
There's plenty wrong.
You refuse to see it.

21:37.567 --> 21:38.795
What's that supposed to mean?

21:38.927 --> 21:41.077
Every time there's a problem
with this project...

21:41.207 --> 21:42.686
you blame it on pilot error...

21:42.807 --> 21:45.685
or gravitational anomalies,
or some technical malfunction.

21:45.807 --> 21:47.684
You're going to have to face the truth...

21:47.807 --> 21:50.037
because there's nothing left
to point a finger at.

21:50.167 --> 21:52.397
Your father designed a lousy engine.

22:26.207 --> 22:27.765
That's enough!

22:32.967 --> 22:34.082
Do something!

22:35.687 --> 22:38.963
Come on, break it up!
Take it easy, you guys.

22:39.367 --> 22:43.155
You think this is gonna get
either of you any closer to warp 5?

22:54.087 --> 22:55.600
The fight was interrupted?

22:55.727 --> 22:58.799
Not before I got two bruised ribs
and a cracked molar.

22:59.167 --> 23:03.001
I suppose we'll never know.
Who would have won.

23:06.727 --> 23:08.558
Main power is fluctuating.

23:08.687 --> 23:11.884
It's all right. Auxiliary is kicking in.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.444
There was a surge in the EPS grid.

23:16.567 --> 23:18.444
We must be getting close.

23:19.807 --> 23:23.561
Trip said the dark matter
might affect the shuttle's systems.

23:23.767 --> 23:25.837
He'll be happy to hear he was right.

23:26.087 --> 23:28.999
It's probably nothing more
than a simple malfunction.

23:29.327 --> 23:30.646
I don't think so.

23:31.527 --> 23:33.995
Our pre-launch checks were all fine.

23:35.127 --> 23:37.516
Something else caused that surge.

23:37.647 --> 23:40.115
I'm not detecting any dark matter.

23:40.527 --> 23:42.677
Have a little faith, T'Pol.

23:44.047 --> 23:47.403
Even if you're right,
it may be dangerous to proceed.

23:48.007 --> 23:50.726
Another surge could disable
life support.

23:52.367 --> 23:54.562
One thing I learned from A.G.

23:55.767 --> 23:58.804
You're never going to get
anywhere without taking risks.

24:00.527 --> 24:03.087
You obviously admired this man.

24:04.367 --> 24:05.641
Quite a bit.

24:05.767 --> 24:07.644
And yet he cracked your molar.

24:08.287 --> 24:11.279
Humans can have funny ways
of forming friendships.

24:11.447 --> 24:13.039
To say the least.

24:17.167 --> 24:19.123
He would have loved it out here.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.638
Too bad he never got the chance.

24:25.007 --> 24:26.679
God knows he earned it.

24:27.807 --> 24:31.277
I thought you said he was responsible
for nearly ending the program.

24:31.407 --> 24:34.365
He was also responsible
for getting it back on course...

24:34.487 --> 24:37.206
with a little help from me and Trip.

24:48.887 --> 24:51.242
I see you're not losing any time.

24:52.167 --> 24:54.965
We're done flying.
No use hanging around.

24:56.207 --> 24:57.276
Here you go.

25:00.247 --> 25:02.442
I'm not clearing out just yet.

25:04.927 --> 25:06.280
Suit yourself.

25:08.567 --> 25:11.764
I've been thinking about
what you were saying last night...

25:12.207 --> 25:14.198
about my father's engine.

25:14.487 --> 25:16.921
- Look, I was out of line.
- You were right.

25:17.847 --> 25:21.681
I wanted to see this thing fly so badly,
it kept me from being objective.

25:21.887 --> 25:26.085
That's good of you to admit,
but, it doesn't really matter now.

25:26.327 --> 25:27.396
It may.

25:28.967 --> 25:31.845
I got my hands on the telemetry
from your flight.

25:32.007 --> 25:34.396
It looks like Tucker was right
about the intermix...

25:34.527 --> 25:36.438
but I think we can compensate for it.

25:36.567 --> 25:39.479
You heard Forrest.
The program is on hold, indefinitely.

25:39.607 --> 25:43.566
We can take this to Starfleet.
Make a case to get off the ground again.

25:45.567 --> 25:48.525
What about the Vulcans?
They'll look at your data and say:

25:48.647 --> 25:50.922
"We need to run simulations
for another 10 years...

25:51.047 --> 25:52.116
"to prove you right."

25:52.247 --> 25:53.885
Commodore Forrest will back us up.

25:54.007 --> 25:56.760
Forrest answers to Starfleet Command.
It's out of his hands.

25:56.887 --> 26:00.357
Even if his two senior pilots insist
that this ship can fly?

26:00.647 --> 26:04.481
If the three of us go in there together,
we might be able to change their minds.

26:04.607 --> 26:08.043
You just went faster than
any human being ever has.

26:08.207 --> 26:10.004
And now you're going to walk away?

26:10.127 --> 26:14.006
Let them put the ship in mothballs when
we're so close to breaking warp 3?

26:15.047 --> 26:17.436
You're always talking about taking risks.

26:18.687 --> 26:20.643
What have we got to lose?

26:22.967 --> 26:26.437
If you want to convince the Vulcans,
you'll have to do a lot better than...

26:26.567 --> 26:29.161
showing them a bunch of
antimatter calculations.

26:29.287 --> 26:31.198
I'm open to suggestions.

26:31.407 --> 26:34.956
We only lost one ship.
Still have one left.

26:42.047 --> 26:43.958
They'll never give us clearance.

26:44.887 --> 26:47.606
Can you think of a better way
to prove it'll fly?

26:48.927 --> 26:52.886
You want to talk about taking risks?
You're a great pilot.

26:53.367 --> 26:55.039
Maybe as good as me.

26:56.127 --> 26:59.722
But you're never going to get out
into deep space by playing it safe.

26:59.847 --> 27:02.077
When the first
warp 5 Starship is built...

27:02.207 --> 27:05.882
its captain won't be able to call home
every time he needs to make a decision.

27:06.007 --> 27:08.077
He won't be able to
turn to the Vulcans...

27:08.207 --> 27:10.767
unless he decides to take one with him.

27:13.327 --> 27:16.080
We should be 20,000 kilometres
inside the nebula.

27:17.327 --> 27:19.557
Let's load up two more charges.

27:23.047 --> 27:26.722
The history of your early warp flights
is well-documented...

27:26.847 --> 27:29.520
but I've never read anything about
two Starfleet pilots...

27:29.647 --> 27:31.524
stealing the warp 3 prototype.

27:33.127 --> 27:36.676
It wasn't the kind of thing
Starfleet Command wanted to advertise.

27:39.847 --> 27:41.326
Don't you believe me?

27:42.767 --> 27:44.598
I have no doubt it happened...

27:44.727 --> 27:49.243
though I find it difficult to believe
you had to be convinced to participate.

27:50.127 --> 27:53.244
Well, you didn't know me then.

27:53.887 --> 27:56.162
I was a little more by-the-book.

27:57.687 --> 28:00.042
The particle density has nearly doubled.

28:01.007 --> 28:02.406
Shall we try again?

28:17.847 --> 28:20.042
Perhaps we should head back.

28:21.607 --> 28:24.440
We still have two more charges.
Let's keep looking.

28:29.047 --> 28:31.561
Was your test flight successful?

28:36.247 --> 28:39.247
Promise you won't put this
into the Vulcan database?

28:39.527 --> 28:41.677
We decided on a night launch.

28:41.967 --> 28:44.765
I've routed the intermix controls to
the engineering station.

28:44.887 --> 28:47.720
If it becomes unstable,
you'll be able to adjust it manually.

28:47.847 --> 28:50.725
If I came along, I could
monitor the antimatter flow.

28:50.847 --> 28:53.759
- I'll keep an eye on it.
- You're going to have your hands full.

28:53.887 --> 28:57.960
We need you down here. Don't worry,
you'll get out there someday.

28:58.087 --> 29:00.965
If I had my own ship,
I'd sign you up in a second.

29:01.087 --> 29:02.964
I'm going to hold you to that.

29:03.847 --> 29:04.996
Thanks, Trip.

29:19.687 --> 29:22.121
No response from the auxiliary APU's.

29:22.367 --> 29:24.961
That's because
they haven't been installed yet.

29:28.727 --> 29:30.046
How's it coming, Trip?

29:30.167 --> 29:32.203
I've disabled the tracking sensors...

29:32.327 --> 29:34.363
but I'll need a minute to
divert the telemetry.

29:34.487 --> 29:35.522
How long?

29:35.647 --> 29:38.957
Don't wait for me.
I'll be ready by the time you break orbit.

29:39.167 --> 29:40.282
Acknowledged.

29:48.807 --> 29:50.957
Not too late to call this off...

29:51.087 --> 29:53.396
head over to the 602 for a beer.

29:53.607 --> 29:55.484
Not on your life.

30:23.287 --> 30:24.766
Anyone notice we're gone yet?

30:24.887 --> 30:28.197
No, as far as they know, the doors
are closed and the lights are out.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.637
But New Berlin should be picking you
up in about six minutes.

30:31.807 --> 30:34.367
By the time they figure out
what's going on...

30:34.567 --> 30:36.364
we'll be halfway to Jupiter.

30:45.207 --> 30:46.640
Come in.

30:48.367 --> 30:50.801
- You're working late.
- We just got a call.

30:51.007 --> 30:53.726
- New Berlin's detected the NX-Beta.
- What?

30:53.927 --> 30:56.521
Internal sensors show
it's still in the hangar.

30:57.127 --> 30:59.243
Has anyone bothered to look?

31:05.367 --> 31:07.483
Warp field is stable.

31:13.207 --> 31:14.799
Something wrong?

31:16.087 --> 31:18.760
- Why don't you take it?
- What?

31:19.047 --> 31:21.720
I had the last flight. You're due up.

31:33.487 --> 31:37.321
Besides, you could use the practice.

31:39.767 --> 31:42.600
I hope you and Tucker
were right about that intermix.

31:43.127 --> 31:45.004
We're about to find out.

31:48.847 --> 31:51.805
This is Forrest.
What the hell is going on?

31:52.087 --> 31:54.396
Just running an engine test, sir.

31:54.527 --> 31:56.199
Archer?

31:57.207 --> 32:00.563
Turn around right now, and I'll do
what I can to keep you out of prison.

32:00.687 --> 32:02.917
If you... Archer!

32:09.087 --> 32:10.406
Perfect!

32:19.647 --> 32:21.444
That's warp 2.

32:25.847 --> 32:29.362
Here we go again.
I'm reading fluctuations in the intermix.

32:29.487 --> 32:30.476
We see it.

32:42.207 --> 32:44.482
Your warp field's destabilising!

32:54.847 --> 32:56.246
Warp 2. 15.

32:58.407 --> 33:00.398
You better get that intermix
locked down...

33:00.527 --> 33:03.405
'cause I'm not backing off
till I break your record.

33:06.767 --> 33:09.156
- Got it?
- Almost.

33:17.767 --> 33:19.837
Come with us, Lieutenant.

33:20.767 --> 33:22.678
NX-Beta, do you read?

33:24.967 --> 33:29.119
NX-Beta to Commodore Forrest.
You might want to check your sensors.

33:29.247 --> 33:32.239
You'll see we're holding steady
at 2.5.

33:33.687 --> 33:37.600
Congratulations.
Now, get the hell back here.

33:48.447 --> 33:52.122
Not only was it in violation
of a direct order...

33:52.247 --> 33:56.445
it was utterly reckless, irresponsible,
and maybe even criminal!

33:56.607 --> 33:58.882
- Sir...
- I'm not done, Commander!

34:00.407 --> 34:03.399
You are both suspended from duty
pending an inquiry.

34:03.567 --> 34:06.206
And by the time Starfleet Command
gets through with you...

34:06.327 --> 34:09.763
you're going to wish
that you had never come back.

34:10.647 --> 34:14.686
You're supposed to represent
the best that Starfleet has to offer.

34:15.567 --> 34:17.876
Keeping this program on track
is hard enough...

34:18.007 --> 34:20.202
without our own officers undermining it.

34:20.327 --> 34:23.558
What did you think
that this stunt of yours...

34:23.726 --> 34:25.284
would accomplish?

34:25.567 --> 34:28.842
That just because
you didn't get yourselves killed...

34:28.967 --> 34:31.639
that we'd ignore
the data we've collected?

34:31.766 --> 34:33.723
The testing we've done?

34:33.847 --> 34:36.360
The recommendations of
the Vulcan Advisory Council?

34:36.487 --> 34:40.560
If we follow all their recommendations,
we'll never make it into deep space.

34:41.007 --> 34:44.522
No one is suggesting that
your warp program be dismantled.

34:44.647 --> 34:47.525
Only that Starfleet proceed
with more restraint.

34:47.647 --> 34:50.844
Get Lieutenant Tucker in here.
Ask any engineer on the project.

34:50.967 --> 34:54.402
They'll tell you, this ship can fly.
Archer and I just proved it.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.204
We're ready to go, now.

34:57.327 --> 34:59.124
That's not your decision to make.

34:59.247 --> 35:01.966
With all due respect,
it's not yours either.

35:03.047 --> 35:04.400
You're right, sir.

35:04.647 --> 35:07.798
We were reckless.
We knew there'd be consequences.

35:08.127 --> 35:10.687
We knew we'd probably be
thrown out of Starfleet.

35:10.807 --> 35:14.004
- You may have been right.
- A.G. And I may never fly again.

35:15.047 --> 35:18.483
But it's a small sacrifice to make
if it keeps this project going.

35:18.607 --> 35:21.519
We didn't build this engine
to make test runs around Jupiter.

35:21.647 --> 35:23.603
We built it to explore.

35:23.727 --> 35:26.685
If my father were alive today,
he'd be standing here asking:

35:26.807 --> 35:29.002
"What the hell are we waiting for?"

35:33.847 --> 35:36.361
You obviously weren't dismissed
from Starfleet.

35:36.487 --> 35:38.876
They must have found
your argument convincing.

35:39.007 --> 35:40.998
Convincing enough.

35:42.887 --> 35:47.244
We managed to avoid a court martial,
but they grounded us for three months.

35:47.367 --> 35:49.881
Still, the NX-Program continued.

35:50.047 --> 35:53.198
Eventually. The Vulcans
had us run every simulation...

35:53.327 --> 35:56.683
they could think of for over a year
before they finally admitted...

35:56.807 --> 35:59.116
the engine would probably work.

35:59.247 --> 36:03.479
Eight months after that,
Duvall broke warp 3 in the NX-Delta.

36:03.927 --> 36:07.886
Five years later, we laid the keel
for Enterprise. You know the rest.

36:12.047 --> 36:14.800
The particle density
has increased again.

36:15.927 --> 36:18.885
I'd hate to see those
last two charges go to waste.

36:29.567 --> 36:31.364
Anything on sensors?

36:35.767 --> 36:37.519
It appears so.

36:54.647 --> 36:55.796
Fascinating.

36:58.047 --> 37:01.198
This data will certainly cause a debate
at the Science Directorate.

37:01.327 --> 37:02.362
T'Pol...

37:05.207 --> 37:06.925
come up and look at this a minute.

37:07.047 --> 37:09.163
I have to monitor the quantum field.

37:10.207 --> 37:11.720
Let the sensors do it.

37:20.447 --> 37:24.156
That's why A.G. And I
worked so hard to get out here.

37:27.567 --> 37:31.879
Captain Robinson wanted to command
Enterprise as much as you did.

37:32.847 --> 37:34.405
He wasn't alone.

37:36.247 --> 37:37.726
But, by the end...

37:39.087 --> 37:41.920
A.G. And I were
the only two candidates left.

37:43.847 --> 37:47.123
They made the final selection
six months before we launched.

37:50.047 --> 37:51.924
Maybe I just got lucky.

37:55.287 --> 37:56.436
Thanks.

37:56.567 --> 37:58.523
Congratulations, Captain.

37:59.287 --> 38:02.802
To Jonathan Archer.
First skipper of the Starship Enterprise.

38:10.047 --> 38:11.605
And one lucky SOB.

38:12.527 --> 38:14.563
Luck had nothing to do with it.

38:14.807 --> 38:16.638
It couldn't have been talent.

38:19.207 --> 38:23.041
I'm just waiting for Forrest to realise
what a horrible mistake he made.

38:25.167 --> 38:26.361
Still...

38:27.407 --> 38:29.443
they could have done a lot worse.

38:29.967 --> 38:32.242
Anyway, I'd rather wait for the NX-02.

38:32.447 --> 38:36.076
Let you make all the mistakes,
so I'll have an easier time of it.

38:37.007 --> 38:39.919
To the first skipper of the NX-02.

38:47.047 --> 38:51.165
Gotta go. I'm catching a shuttle to
Alice Springs at 0600.

38:52.007 --> 38:54.043
More survival training.

38:55.447 --> 38:56.800
Night, Ruby.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.440
Good luck, Jon.

39:04.167 --> 39:07.921
Hey, I'll see you out there.

39:13.847 --> 39:15.121
Captain...

39:17.647 --> 39:20.844
we should start back
if we're going to make our rendezvous.

39:21.927 --> 39:23.042
Right.

39:32.807 --> 39:35.082
Welcome back. How'd it go?

39:35.527 --> 39:37.518
Your charges were effective.

39:37.967 --> 39:39.639
Was it a good show?

39:40.047 --> 39:41.924
You should have been there.

39:42.047 --> 39:44.117
I'll remember to ask you next time.

39:46.767 --> 39:50.476
I believe there's a human custom that
when you discover something of merit...

39:50.607 --> 39:52.598
you earn the right to name it.

39:52.727 --> 39:56.640
What would you suggest?
The "T'Pol/Archer Nebula"?

39:56.967 --> 40:00.403
I was thinking the "Robinson Nebula"
would be more appropriate.
