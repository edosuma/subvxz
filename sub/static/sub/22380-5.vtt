Hey.

00:19.061 --> 00:21.647
(sighs)
Wow, it's you.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.525
Yeah. I was, uh, just out
for a walk, I saw this place,

00:24.567 --> 00:26.318
and I wondered if you're
still working here.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.446
Unfortunately.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.282
What about you?

00:31.323 --> 00:33.367
Are you working?

00:33.409 --> 00:36.996
Y-Yeah. I'm a-a P.A. at a video
production company in SoHo.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.539
What sort of stuff do you do?

00:38.581 --> 00:40.082
Oh, mostly fetch coffee,
send faxes.

00:40.124 --> 00:41.625
No, I meant the company.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.252
Oh, yeah. Commercials,

00:43.294 --> 00:45.212
uh, MTV videos,
public service announcements.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.547
Very cool.

00:46.589 --> 00:48.632
-It can be.
-Yeah. My, um,

00:48.674 --> 00:51.260
my friend Xan,
she did a music video

00:51.302 --> 00:53.721
for this Scottish band
called Aztec Camera.

00:53.763 --> 00:56.140
It's getting airplay in Europe.

00:56.182 --> 00:58.100
Huh. Good for Xan.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.810
Oh, that's right.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.979
I forgot that you two
hate each other.

01:02.021 --> 01:04.356
Look, if you're too busy
or this is weird...

01:04.398 --> 01:06.025
Hey. Hey, no.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.735
No.

01:07.777 --> 01:10.279
No, it's fine, really.

01:10.321 --> 01:11.697
I'm glad that you came in.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.699
It's nice to see you.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.618
You, too.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.620
(Skye laughs)

01:17.661 --> 01:19.288
Oh, my God.

01:19.330 --> 01:21.040
You smoke now?

01:21.081 --> 01:22.500
Yep.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.502
Guess I was a bad influence.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.295
In a lot of ways.

01:26.337 --> 01:28.798
You sure I'm not keeping you
from your tables?

01:28.839 --> 01:32.301
I think they're okay.

01:32.343 --> 01:35.763
Yeah, it's pretty dead
in here tonight.

01:35.805 --> 01:38.015
Every night.
That's why I'm quitting.

01:38.057 --> 01:40.059
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.936
Actually, it's good
you came in when you did,

01:41.977 --> 01:43.479
-or you might have missed me.
-Where you going?

01:43.521 --> 01:44.772
(inhales sharply)

01:44.814 --> 01:46.857
Café Un Deux Trois,
Times Square.

01:46.899 --> 01:48.692
But only a couple nights a week,

01:48.734 --> 01:50.861
because I really want to focus
on my jewelry.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.239
Wow.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.408
That's so cool you've been
selling your stuff.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.077
Feels like I finally
found my thing.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.497
Métier, whatever
you want to call it.

02:01.539 --> 02:04.500
Yeah. I'm really happy for you.

02:05.543 --> 02:07.670
Thanks.

02:07.711 --> 02:11.715
Uh, you ever
make earrings for dudes?

02:11.757 --> 02:13.259
Why?

02:13.300 --> 02:16.095
Well, I was just thinking
of getting mine pierced.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.763
No, you're not.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.265
-Oh, yes, I am. Yep, for real.
-Uh-uh.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.058
I think it could really work
with my look.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.519
-(laughs) -I think they say
if you get your left pierced,

02:23.561 --> 02:25.729
you're straight; if you do
the right, you're gay;

02:25.771 --> 02:27.189
and if you do both, you're bi,

02:27.231 --> 02:28.899
or like a buccaneer--
I'm not sure.

02:28.941 --> 02:31.610
(laughs)
So which one are you these days?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.112
I'm nothing. I'm celibate.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.780
Oh?

02:34.822 --> 02:36.824
Not by choice.
I mean, it's just really hard

02:36.866 --> 02:38.492
to meet girls in this city.

02:38.534 --> 02:39.910
Either they're crazy
or in a relationship.

02:39.952 --> 02:41.745
It's okay to admit it.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.834
I ruined you for other women.

02:46.876 --> 02:48.210
That, too.

02:48.252 --> 02:50.004
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.255
(laughs)

02:53.966 --> 02:56.385
I was wondering if we'd
ever run into each other.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.846
Yeah, me, too.

02:58.888 --> 03:01.891
My dad asks all the time.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.101
I think he secretly wishes
we were still together.

03:04.143 --> 03:05.686
I doubt that.

03:05.728 --> 03:07.938
Oh, did he tell you he hired me
to make a video for him?

03:07.980 --> 03:09.773
Ugh, what for?

03:09.815 --> 03:11.275
Well, it's to convince
the Red Oaks members

03:11.317 --> 03:12.359
not to sell the place.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.194
Ah, his beloved Red Oaks.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.946
Yeah. The video turned out
pretty decent.

03:15.988 --> 03:18.908
And for your father's sake,
I really hope it works.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.076
Me, too.
I don't know what he'll do

03:21.118 --> 03:23.579
if it sells--
he loves that place.

03:23.621 --> 03:26.165
(sighs)
He, uh...

03:26.206 --> 03:29.627
He told me once
that when he was a kid,

03:29.668 --> 03:31.378
he used to be embarrassed

03:31.420 --> 03:33.130
because all of
his friends' fathers

03:33.172 --> 03:36.592
were business executives
who belonged to country clubs.

03:36.634 --> 03:38.594
But his was just
a high school teacher,

03:38.636 --> 03:42.431
so he and my Uncle Marv
had to swim in community pools

03:42.473 --> 03:44.183
and play on
public tennis courts.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.478
It's like all he ever
wanted in his life

03:47.519 --> 03:51.231
was to work on Wall Street
and belong to Red Oaks.

03:53.233 --> 03:57.655
Now that he's banned
from trading for life...

03:57.696 --> 04:00.491
the only thing he has to look
forward to when he gets out

04:00.532 --> 04:01.784
is the club.

what you better want.

07:33.370 --> 07:36.331

I want a big steak.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.834
-Ooh.
-No, no, change that.

-Ugh.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.724
What is all this?

07:53.765 --> 07:56.768
Oh. That's for work.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.729
Work? What work?

07:58.770 --> 08:00.439
I got a job.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.357
Really? Since when?

08:02.399 --> 08:04.109
About a month ago.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.694
As a cruise director?

08:05.736 --> 08:08.447
As a travel agent,
I'll have you know.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.408
Fay, I thought
we discussed this.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.160
No, there was no discussion.

08:13.202 --> 08:14.703
You were putting your foot down.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.830
And I'm sorry, Douglas,
from here on in,

08:16.872 --> 08:18.832
it's gonna be a little different
around here.

08:18.874 --> 08:20.667
You left me alone for a year.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.211
I might as well been a widow.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.588
I had to learn how to
do the taxes myself,

08:24.630 --> 08:26.298
and-and how to deal
with all the lawyers,

08:26.340 --> 08:28.175
and-and make all these
big decisions on my own.

08:28.217 --> 08:30.636
And you know what?
I liked it.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.096
In fact, I was pretty good
at it, so...

08:33.138 --> 08:35.224
I am putting my foot down.

08:35.265 --> 08:38.852
As far as my job goes,
that is non-negotiable.

08:44.900 --> 08:48.612
Just a reminder, final seminar
papers are due in my mailbox

08:48.654 --> 08:51.698
no later than midnight
next Thursday.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.744
Wheeler.

08:55.786 --> 08:58.288
Yes, Professor.

09:00.123 --> 09:04.294
Turns out I wasn't ovulating
last week, after all.

09:04.336 --> 09:07.339
It's all terribly confusing.

09:07.381 --> 09:10.342
My cycle has never been
what you'd call regular.

09:10.384 --> 09:14.012
Mm. Okay.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.266
My point is
we need to try again.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.894
I've spoken to my gynecologist,
and she feels fairly certain

09:20.936 --> 09:23.897
we'll have a real window
of opportunity next Saturday.

09:26.942 --> 09:30.112
So, until then, I want you
to drink plenty of fluids

09:30.153 --> 09:33.031
and don't abuse yourself
too much.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.994
You need to conserve your...
strength.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.714
Let me put a hundred on
Sara's Smile

09:48.755 --> 09:52.342
in the fourth,
another two on Private Dancer.

09:52.384 --> 09:55.387
Actually, let me call you back.

09:55.429 --> 09:58.140
Holy shit!

09:58.181 --> 10:00.267
Ghost of Christmas Past.

10:00.309 --> 10:04.062
Uh, sorry. Forgot they don't
celebrate Christmas at Red Oaks.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.188
Hello, Brett.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.065
(both chuckle)

10:07.107 --> 10:09.401
-Ah, how are you?
-(sighs)

10:09.443 --> 10:11.153
-Great suit. Yeah.
-Oh, great. Thank you.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.572
You know, they buried
my granddad in one just like it.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.991
-(laughs)
-Teasing. You look sharp.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.743
-Come on in. Sit, sit, sit.
-Thank you.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.161
BRETT:
Mm.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.954
I appreciate you seeing me,
Brett.

10:20.996 --> 10:23.582
Of course. I wouldn't be
sitting in this chair

10:23.623 --> 10:25.042
if you hadn't hired me.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.502
Yes, it seems that you've
done very well for yourself.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.755
In my day, the head pro
didn't have an office.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.506
Yeah, yeah.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.301
Well, that's what happens
when you take a tennis program

10:34.343 --> 10:36.261
from sixth in the state
to fifth.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.013
(chuckles)
See that door?

10:38.055 --> 10:40.140
-My own bathroom.
-Oh.

10:40.182 --> 10:43.602
-You want to take it for a spin?
-No, maybe later.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.063
So, Nash,
what brings you in today?

10:46.104 --> 10:48.440
Ah, well, um, I'm sure
you've heard the rumor

10:48.482 --> 10:50.650
that Red Oaks is potentially
being sold.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.070
Well, the members
don't vote until next week,

10:53.111 --> 10:55.989
but on the off chance that
the result is not as I hope,

10:56.031 --> 11:00.577
I thought it prudent to consider
my employment options elsewhere.

11:02.621 --> 11:04.456
Here?

11:04.498 --> 11:07.417
That be weird for you?

11:07.459 --> 11:09.419
Working under
your old assistant,

11:09.461 --> 11:13.423
bumping into your ex-wife
and her new husband by the pool.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.051
She got herself a new pair
of Pound Puppies, by the way.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.595
(whistles)
Totally rocks a bikini now.

11:18.637 --> 11:20.013
I'm happy for her.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.973
-It is something.
-But as for

11:22.015 --> 11:24.893
working under you,
I-I don't think that would be

11:24.935 --> 11:27.896
awkward or demoralizing
in the least.

11:27.938 --> 11:31.274
Well, as luck would have it,

11:31.316 --> 11:34.194
-I do need a new assistant.
-You do?

11:34.236 --> 11:37.280
Of course, I was thinking
of someone along the lines

11:37.322 --> 11:39.408
-of a college kid.
-I'll take it.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.119
Whatever the pay.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.287
Wow. (laughs)

11:44.329 --> 11:46.665
Okay. Awesome.

11:46.706 --> 11:51.336
I guess that leaves just
the-the one little formality.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.046
Formality?

11:53.088 --> 11:54.840
Need to see you hit.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.092
Oh, well, you've seen me
hit dozens of times.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.635
Yeah, not lately.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.303
Got to make sure
you haven't gotten rusty

12:00.345 --> 12:01.680
in your old age there.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.973
Did you mean today?

12:03.014 --> 12:04.933
I'm-I'm not exactly
dressed for tennis.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.059
Doesn't matter.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.936
Nash I knew never broke a sweat.

12:07.978 --> 12:09.771
Hmm.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.232
Well, do you have a pair
of shorts that I could borrow

12:12.274 --> 12:13.608
from your pro shop?

12:13.650 --> 12:17.821
You know, I'm afraid
we don't stock your size.

12:17.863 --> 12:20.699
Ah, come on. You're fine.
It'll be fun.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.826
Like old times.

I'm just, I don't know where I'm
gonna get that kind of money.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.819

fixing up the place.

Uh-huh. You'll receive
my full report

14:23.989 --> 14:25.949
-in three business days.
-Thank you.

14:27.993 --> 14:29.953
Oh, piece of advice:

14:29.995 --> 14:32.956
you'll want to take care
of the mouse problem

14:32.998 --> 14:35.041
before your health inspection.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.210
I saw some droppings
in the back.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.506
Come on, Gracie.

14:41.548 --> 14:45.093
That's supposed to be your job.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.596
RON:
We made good time.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.514
Well, because we were
doing 90 on the highway.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.932
Oh, were we?

14:50.974 --> 14:52.642
Can't believe we weren't
pulled over by a cop.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.436
That's what radar detectors
are for.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.938
Do you still need me to help you
with your presentation later?

14:56.980 --> 14:59.357
Yeah, I'm just gonna go drop my
bags and grab my bathing suit.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.692
Your bathing suit?

15:00.734 --> 15:03.737
No reason we can't catch
a few rays at the same time.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.905
I'll see you poolside.

15:05.947 --> 15:08.450
Okay.

15:08.491 --> 15:12.245
Red Oaks has always been
like a second home to me.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.247
And during some low points
in my marriage,

15:14.289 --> 15:16.541
it actually functioned
as a first home.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.919
(over TV): What does
the word "home" conjure for you?

15:19.961 --> 15:21.630
I'll tell you
what it does for me,

15:21.671 --> 15:24.257
besides the obvious,
like mother's silent treatment

15:24.299 --> 15:26.176
and overly rigid
toilet training.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.844
GETTY:
I like the Japanese.

15:27.886 --> 15:31.348
Industrious people,
very shrewd businessmen.

15:31.389 --> 15:34.017
Hell, my wife drives a Toyota.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.853
Home represents belonging.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.816
Red Oaks belongs to me.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.861
And I to it, forever and always.

15:44.903 --> 15:47.614
Unless of course you sell to
Japanese real estate developers.

15:47.656 --> 15:51.284
As Americans,
we got to draw a line.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.578
I mean, if we start
selling foreigners

15:53.620 --> 15:56.915
the land out from
under our feet,

15:56.956 --> 15:58.291
what are we left standing on?

15:58.333 --> 15:59.417
NASH:
I beg of you,

15:59.459 --> 16:01.920
vote no...

16:01.961 --> 16:04.297

Don't be afraid.

Where's Cecil?

16:56.015 --> 16:57.350
And why are you dressed
like that?

16:57.392 --> 16:59.769
To make this easier for us both.

16:59.811 --> 17:00.979
Make what easier?

17:01.020 --> 17:01.980
Coitus.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.231
I'm not having coitus.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.275
You must.
I'm ovulating as we speak.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.359
What about the turkey baster?

17:06.401 --> 17:07.944
I threw it out. It didn't work.

17:07.986 --> 17:10.155
Don't worry, Wheeler.
I have no more intention

-I'm sorry, I-I can't do this.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.786
This is purely procreative.

17:16.828 --> 17:19.789
I should've never agreed
to this. I'm sorry.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.583
That's the closet.

You're about her size.

so, instead, just do this

18:08.421 --> 18:10.173

You were great.

18:22.644 --> 18:24.020
You didn't seem nervous at all.

Everyone seemed really into it.

18:25.688 --> 18:28.149
You want to know my secret
for stage fright?

18:28.191 --> 18:31.277
I picture the audience
in their underwear.

-Every time.

pictured you in yours.

No, thank you.
This has been amazing.

interesting people.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.678

Whew.

I better slow down.

19:07.272 --> 19:08.982
Or eat something.

19:09.023 --> 19:11.109
I'll order some food.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.404
I feel ridiculous.

19:14.445 --> 19:15.989
Well, you look cute.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.824
You should wear women's clothes
more often.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.868
Ha-ha. Ow!

19:19.909 --> 19:21.452
God, you squirm
more than my sister.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.871
Was she your first victim?

19:22.912 --> 19:24.956
Yeah, I used to make
all of her dresses.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.792
Junior prom, beauty pageants,
her wedding dress.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.962
Oh, wow. So you've always
wanted to be a designer?

19:31.004 --> 19:32.797
Designer?

19:32.839 --> 19:34.716
Geez. I don't know.

19:34.757 --> 19:37.427
I just have always loved sewing,
you know?

19:37.468 --> 19:40.680
Working with fabrics,
cutting patterns.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.849
There's something
super gratifying about

19:42.891 --> 19:45.768
making something pretty and
artistic but still functional.

19:45.810 --> 19:48.563
It's like a painting
or a sculpture

19:48.605 --> 19:50.607
that somebody walks around in.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.193
That sounded really pretentious,
didn't it?

19:54.235 --> 19:55.737
-(chuckles)
-No.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.782
You ever wonder
if you're wasting your time

19:59.824 --> 20:01.409
trying to make it
in this business?

20:01.451 --> 20:02.994
Thanks a lot.

20:03.036 --> 20:06.706
Oh, no, I don't mean you.
I mean, like, anyone.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.249

20:08.291 --> 20:10.168
You're not wasting
your time, David.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.713
But you are letting Derek mess
with your head way too much.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.298
Well, he's been doing this
a long time.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.300
It's still just
one man's opinion--

20:17.342 --> 20:20.053
one very unhappy man
who wishes he was a director,

20:20.094 --> 20:23.181
so he's resentful
of anyone young and talented.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.141
Especially someone
he thinks is hot.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.976
Huh?

20:27.018 --> 20:30.063
God, you're clueless.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.231
Wait, you're saying Derek's
being such a dick to me

20:32.273 --> 20:34.484
-because he thinks I'm talented?
-I'm saying that ultimately

20:34.525 --> 20:37.362
it doesn't matter
what he or anyone else thinks.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.280
I mean, people's opinions
are speed bumps,

20:39.322 --> 20:41.032
they're not brick walls.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.493
I'm not even sure that talent
matters all that much.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.203
I mean, think about it.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.413
This is New York City,
where anyone

20:47.455 --> 20:50.583
who was ever voted Most Talented
in their high school moves.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.418
So they can't all make it.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.129
It can't just be about talent.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.090
It's about who wants it more.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.175
Thanks, Coach.

20:59.217 --> 21:00.677

Thank Noah.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.303
He's the one
that gave me that pep talk

21:02.345 --> 21:04.305
when we first moved here
and none of the fashion houses

21:04.347 --> 21:06.307
-would hire me.
-Well, I'm actually glad,

21:06.349 --> 21:08.309
'cause you wouldn't have
wound up working here.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.520
Aw, Jesus, what the fuck
are you wearing?

21:10.561 --> 21:12.563
You look like a rent boy.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.406

Larry, Sarah,

21:21.447 --> 21:22.490
nice to see you.

21:22.532 --> 21:23.533
Step on up.

21:23.574 --> 21:24.993
Grab yourself a ballot.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.911
They got the little pencils
there for you.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.038
-Herb, how are you?
-Douglas.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.874
How are you adjusting
to life on the outside?

21:31.916 --> 21:33.876
-It's not bad.
-Oh.

21:33.918 --> 21:36.713
Did you wind up going gay
in the slammer?

21:36.754 --> 21:38.381
Not even tempted.

21:38.423 --> 21:40.717
Oh. I don't blame you,
with a looker

21:40.758 --> 21:42.635
-like Fay at home.
-(chuckles) Thank you.

But if you get locked up again,

I don't think you came in here

21:51.728 --> 21:54.022
just to kibitz
and compliment my wife.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.566
Rebecca Horowitz
sent you in here

21:56.607 --> 21:59.318
to see if I'm
intimidating voters, right?

21:59.360 --> 22:02.071
Or stuffing the ballot boxes.

22:03.740 --> 22:07.160
Do me a favor,
tell her to go fuck herself.

22:07.201 --> 22:08.703
-Oh.
-Seriously,

22:08.745 --> 22:10.121
ever since she became president,

22:10.163 --> 22:12.915
this place has gone to hell
in a handbasket.

22:12.957 --> 22:14.792
Am I right?
Come on, you know I'm right.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.294
Tell me if I'm wrong.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.879
I'm not wrong.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.423
-Bernie, thank you.
-Yeah.

22:20.465 --> 22:22.467
(quietly): Oh, geez.
Is his name Bernie?

22:22.508 --> 22:24.719
I don't think it is. Shit.

22:24.761 --> 22:27.305
-RON: Disgusting.

If you are so grossed out
by people's mouths,

22:29.682 --> 22:31.434

become a dentist?

22:31.476 --> 22:33.436
For the babes.

22:33.478 --> 22:34.979
Be serious.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.689
Okay. For the money.

22:36.731 --> 22:38.441
I don't believe you.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.026
All right.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.864
So, um, I have
a confession to make.

22:44.906 --> 22:47.283
-Uh-oh.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.127
Well, in my defense,
you got the bod.

22:58.169 --> 23:01.255
And for some reason, a lot
of exotic dancers I've known

23:01.297 --> 23:03.257

23:03.299 --> 23:05.176

flattered or offended.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.307
Or is it... the latter?

keep those straight. -Yeah.
