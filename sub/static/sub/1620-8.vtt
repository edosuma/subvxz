01:57.201 --> 01:59.828
Yah! Left high, left low.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.556
Right low, lunge right.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.395
You break anything,
the septa will have my head.

02:25.521 --> 02:27.940
What is...

02:38.492 --> 02:41.036
Your sister knew perfectly well
we were to leave today.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.247
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.916
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.752
She always comes back with scrapes
and bruises. She's so clumsy.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.088
Hush!

02:51.171 --> 02:53.715
Go back to your room.

02:53.799 --> 02:57.261
Bar the doors and do not open them
for anyone you do not know.

02:57.386 --> 03:00.305
- What is it? What's happening?
- Do as I told you.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.432
Run!

03:05.727 --> 03:07.688
This way!

03:20.909 --> 03:23.620
Left, right. Rah!

03:23.745 --> 03:26.957
- Now you are dead.
- You said right,

03:27.040 --> 03:28.750
but you went left.

03:28.834 --> 03:32.504
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'cause you lied.

03:32.588 --> 03:36.758
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.

03:36.884 --> 03:40.137
- You were not seeing.
- I was so. I watched, but you...

03:40.262 --> 03:44.391
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.

03:46.393 --> 03:50.147
The seeing, the true seeing,

03:50.272 --> 03:52.649
that is the heart of swordplay.

03:57.112 --> 04:01.033
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.

04:03.535 --> 04:07.331
And why is it that Lord Eddard
is sending Lannister men

04:07.414 --> 04:09.041
in place of his own?

04:09.166 --> 04:12.669
- I am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.

04:12.753 --> 04:16.964
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.305
And I don't have to go
with you if I don't want.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.682
Take her.

04:25.766 --> 04:29.686
Are you men or snakes,
that you would threaten a child?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.939
Get out of my way, little man.

04:32.523 --> 04:35.317
I am Syrio Forel...

04:35.442 --> 04:37.277
Foreign bastard.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.867
...and you will be speaking to me
with more respect.

04:43.992 --> 04:47.329
Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.

04:47.454 --> 04:51.708
Arya child, we are done
with dancing for the day.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.294
Run to your father.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.858
Bloody oafs.

05:17.359 --> 05:21.071
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me. Run.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.701
The first sword of Braavos does not run.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.840
What do we say

05:39.965 --> 05:42.467
to the god of death?

05:42.593 --> 05:44.303
Not today.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.056
Go.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.291
Not today. Not today.

06:23.967 --> 06:27.513
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.349
I'll... I'll tell the queen.

06:30.474 --> 06:34.061
Who do you think sent me?

06:47.157 --> 06:49.159
Needle.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.705
There she is.

06:53.789 --> 06:56.124
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.835
- Come here.
- Leave me be.

06:57.918 --> 07:01.630
- My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me - the queen!

07:02.339 --> 07:04.299
Stay away!

07:32.911 --> 07:36.331
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.002
Varys.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.256
I promise you it isn't poisoned.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.468
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?

07:56.518 --> 07:58.395
Not so much, my lord.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.689
I would save the rest, if I were you.

08:00.814 --> 08:04.651
Hide it. Men have been known
to die of thirst in these cells.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.697
What about my daughters?

08:08.822 --> 08:11.200
The younger one seems
to have escaped the castle.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.911
Even my little birds cannot find her.

08:14.036 --> 08:17.247
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.

08:17.372 --> 08:21.251
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though...

08:21.335 --> 08:25.214
all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.718
You watched my men
being slaughtered and did nothing.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.136
And would again, my lord.

08:32.221 --> 08:36.433
I was unarmed, unarmoured
and surrounded by Lannister swords.

08:36.517 --> 08:39.686
When you look at me
do you see a hero?

08:44.900 --> 08:47.236
What madness led you to tell the queen

08:47.319 --> 08:50.864
you had learned the truth
about Joffrey's birth?

08:52.157 --> 08:54.201
The madness of mercy.

08:56.995 --> 09:00.624
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.

09:00.749 --> 09:03.919
It's always
the innocents who suffer.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.130
It wasn't the wine
that killed Robert, nor the boar.

09:07.256 --> 09:10.592
The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

09:10.676 --> 09:14.096
but it was your mercy
that killed the king.

09:17.182 --> 09:20.853
I trust you know you're
a dead man, Lord Eddard?

09:24.982 --> 09:29.736
The queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.

09:29.820 --> 09:34.366
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.369
Your wife has let the Imp
slip through her fingers.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.750
If that's true,

09:44.835 --> 09:47.921
then slit my throat
and be done with it.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.048
Not today, my lord.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.804
Tell me something, Varys.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.640
Who do you truly serve?

09:59.933 --> 10:02.519
The realm, my lord.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.646
Someone must.

10:23.665 --> 10:26.668
It's Othor, without a doubt.

10:27.461 --> 10:32.216
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord,
less the hand the wolf tore off.

10:32.341 --> 10:35.761
Any sign of Benjen
or the rest of his party?

10:35.886 --> 10:39.848
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.

10:39.932 --> 10:42.601
- Mmm.
- The smell.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.647
What smell?

10:48.899 --> 10:50.734
There is none.

10:50.859 --> 10:54.530
If they'd been dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

10:55.948 --> 10:59.535
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.870
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.

11:02.621 --> 11:05.499
I want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

11:06.500 --> 11:10.671
You may be a coward, Tarly,
but you're not stupid.

11:11.255 --> 11:14.675
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.001
Lord Commander!

11:19.054 --> 11:21.807
Maester Aemon
awaits you in his chambers...

11:21.932 --> 11:24.685
A raven from King's Landing.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.312
Come on, move 'em out.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.742
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,

11:41.743 --> 11:44.037
and pour one for yourself.

11:53.964 --> 11:56.425
The king is dead.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.064
Is there any word of my father?

12:11.190 --> 12:13.192
Sit.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.449
Lord Stark has been

12:20.574 --> 12:22.284
charged with treason.

12:23.285 --> 12:26.163
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

12:26.288 --> 12:29.208
to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.

12:40.802 --> 12:44.264
I hope you're not thinking
of doing anything stupid.

12:44.389 --> 12:47.809
Your duty lies here now.

12:48.227 --> 12:50.771
My sisters were in King's Landing too.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.275
I'm sure they'll be

12:55.359 --> 12:57.069
treated gently.

13:00.322 --> 13:04.076
Your father has proved to be
an awful traitor, dear.

13:04.201 --> 13:07.079
King Robert's body was still warm

13:07.204 --> 13:11.291
when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.877
He wouldn't do that.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.672
He knows how much
I love Joffrey. He wouldn't.

13:17.673 --> 13:19.716
Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

13:19.842 --> 13:23.387
Send for my father. He'll tell you -
the king was his friend.

13:23.512 --> 13:27.391
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent
of any wrong. We know that.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.977
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.354
How can I allow you to marry my son?

13:33.021 --> 13:35.357
A child born of a traitor's seed

13:35.482 --> 13:37.776
is no fit consort for our king.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.362
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace,

13:40.445 --> 13:44.908
but in 10 years who knows
what treasons she may hatch?

13:45.033 --> 13:48.036
No, I'm not. I'll be
a good wife to him, you'll see.

13:48.120 --> 13:52.541
I'll be a queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.

13:54.168 --> 13:56.253
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.

13:57.045 --> 14:00.382
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

14:06.889 --> 14:11.059
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn
and your brother, the eldest,

14:11.101 --> 14:13.770
- what's his name?
- Robb.

14:13.854 --> 14:17.024
Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

14:17.107 --> 14:21.278
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father,

14:21.403 --> 14:24.615
urge your brother
to keep the king's peace.

14:24.740 --> 14:27.784
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

14:33.123 --> 14:38.086
If... If I could see my father,
talk to him about...

14:40.047 --> 14:42.090
You disappoint me, child.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.594
We have told you
of your father's treason.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.930
Why would you want
to speak to a traitor?

14:48.889 --> 14:50.933
I only meant that...

14:52.392 --> 14:54.228
What will happen to him?

14:55.938 --> 14:58.232
- That depends.
- On...

14:59.191 --> 15:01.944
- On what?
- On your brother.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.949
And on you.

15:15.249 --> 15:17.084
Treason?

15:18.210 --> 15:19.670
Sansa wrote this?

15:19.795 --> 15:22.172
It is your sister's hand,
but the queen's words.

15:22.256 --> 15:26.260
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new king.

15:26.385 --> 15:29.471
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his arse kissed?

15:30.764 --> 15:33.475
This is a royal command, my lord.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.271
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.

15:37.354 --> 15:41.358
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.361
But not alone.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.240
Call the banners.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.702
All of them, my lord?

15:51.827 --> 15:53.777
They've all sworn to defend my father,
have they not?

15:53.787 --> 15:55.664
They have.

15:55.747 --> 15:57.916
Now we see
what their words are worth.

16:00.169 --> 16:01.170
Yes.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.805
Are you afraid?

16:14.933 --> 16:16.685
I must be.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.228
Good.

16:19.229 --> 16:22.941
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.

16:46.465 --> 16:48.217
You've had this since dawn?

16:49.468 --> 16:51.720
He sent it to me, not you.

16:52.721 --> 16:56.058
- I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?!

16:56.141 --> 16:58.268
My husband has been taken prisoner.

16:58.352 --> 17:01.772
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?

17:01.855 --> 17:04.233
Your son against the Lannisters?

17:05.442 --> 17:08.779
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.

17:08.862 --> 17:12.031
Ned rots in a dungeon
and you speak of patience?

17:12.616 --> 17:14.660
He is your brother by law!

17:14.826 --> 17:17.746
Does family mean nothing to you?

17:17.871 --> 17:20.624
Family means everything to me.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.501
And I will not risk Robin's life

17:22.542 --> 17:25.295
to get caught up in another
of your husband's wars.

17:25.420 --> 17:28.590
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.551
You just ate.

17:30.634 --> 17:33.470
You will not support us, then?
Do I understand you correctly?

17:33.512 --> 17:37.266
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.436
You're always welcome here, sister.

17:41.979 --> 17:44.690
But if you're asking me
to send men from the Vale to fight...

17:44.857 --> 17:46.942
That is what I ask.

17:48.986 --> 17:50.904
Go on, sweet.

17:51.029 --> 17:53.031
Time for your bath.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.576
I'll feed you after.

17:59.705 --> 18:02.124
If you fear for the safety of your son...

18:02.291 --> 18:05.252
Of course I fear
for the safety of my son!

18:05.377 --> 18:07.296
Are you an idiot?

18:07.421 --> 18:09.798
They killed my husband.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.301
You say they shoved
your boy from a window.

18:12.426 --> 18:16.930
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.

18:20.976 --> 18:23.520
The knights of the Vale
will stay in the Vale

18:23.645 --> 18:25.230
where they belong,

18:25.314 --> 18:27.524
to protect their lord.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.081
Will you shut up?

18:46.001 --> 18:48.170
There's hill tribes all around here.

18:49.171 --> 18:53.133
If I'm going to die, it may as well be
with a song in my heart.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.595
I should just take your food
and leave you here.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.305
Eh?

18:58.388 --> 19:02.351
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.

19:02.518 --> 19:05.103
You don't think I'd do it, do you?

19:06.021 --> 19:09.650
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold? Women?

19:09.775 --> 19:11.735
Golden women?

19:11.902 --> 19:14.071
Stick with me and you'll have them all,

19:14.238 --> 19:17.282
for as long as I'm around
and not a moment longer.

19:18.242 --> 19:20.244
But you knew that.

19:20.327 --> 19:24.331
That is why you so valiantly
took up arms to defend my honour.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.584
Fair enough.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.587
But don't go looking
for me to bend the knee

19:30.671 --> 19:33.882
and "my lord" you
every time you take a shit.

19:34.007 --> 19:37.511
I'm not your toady
and I'm not your friend.

19:37.636 --> 19:39.847
Though I would treasure
your friendship,

19:39.888 --> 19:43.141
I'm mainly interested
in your facility with murder.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.894
And if the day ever comes
when you're tempted to sell me out,

19:46.019 --> 19:47.604
remember this -

19:47.688 --> 19:49.356
whatever their price,

19:49.439 --> 19:51.024
I'll beat it.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.193
I like living.

19:57.573 --> 20:00.993
Tyrion.

20:02.786 --> 20:04.496
Tyrion.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.377
Tyrion.

20:31.940 --> 20:34.234
Come, share our fire.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.571
Help yourselves to our goat.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.121
When you meet your gods,
you tell them

20:46.288 --> 20:51.835
Shagga, son of Dolf,
of the Stone Crows sent you.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.130
I am Tyrion, son of Tywin
of Clan Lannister.

20:55.297 --> 20:58.300
How would you like to die,
Tyrion, son of Tywin?

21:00.302 --> 21:03.180
In my own bed,
at the age of 8O

21:03.305 --> 21:05.849
with a belly full of wine
and a girl's mouth around my cock.

21:11.605 --> 21:13.565
Take the halfman.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.610
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.

21:16.777 --> 21:18.904
No, no, no, no, no!

21:19.404 --> 21:21.990
My... My house is rich and powerful.

21:22.616 --> 21:26.161
If you see us through these mountains,
my father will shower you with gold.

21:26.245 --> 21:28.705
We have no use
for a halfman's promises.

21:28.789 --> 21:33.168
Halfman maybe, but at least I have
the courage to face my enemies.

21:33.252 --> 21:37.130
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver

21:37.214 --> 21:39.716
when the knights
of the Vale ride by?

21:40.717 --> 21:42.803
Are those the best weapons
you could steal?

21:44.137 --> 21:47.808
Good enough for killing sheep,
if the sheep don't fight back.

21:47.891 --> 21:49.977
Lannister smiths shit better steel.

21:55.858 --> 21:59.069
You think you can win us over
with your trinkets?

22:10.205 --> 22:14.334
That trinket is worth more
than everything your tribe owns.

22:15.502 --> 22:18.922
But if you help us,
Shagga, son of Dolf,

22:19.047 --> 22:21.216
I will not give you trinkets.

22:22.009 --> 22:23.844
I will give you this.

22:24.553 --> 22:26.305
What is "this"?

22:27.723 --> 22:30.017
The Vale of Arryn.

22:30.100 --> 22:33.353
The lords of the Vale
have always spat upon the hill tribes.

22:34.563 --> 22:37.649
The lords of the Vale want me dead.

22:39.359 --> 22:42.362
I believe it is time
for new lords of the Vale.

22:50.287 --> 22:52.247
Now there's a rare sight...

22:52.289 --> 22:56.335
Not only a bastard,
but a traitor's bastard.

23:06.803 --> 23:09.389
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!

23:12.851 --> 23:14.937
Blood will always tell.

23:15.729 --> 23:18.023
You'll hang for this, bastard.

23:37.459 --> 23:40.671
I told you not to do anything stupid.

23:41.755 --> 23:44.132
You're confined to quarters. Go.

24:08.824 --> 24:10.826
Ghost, what's wrong?

24:13.161 --> 24:14.830
Is someone out there?

24:46.069 --> 24:48.238
Commander?

24:52.075 --> 24:54.077
Stay.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.841
Hello?

25:16.850 --> 25:18.977
Who's there?

25:24.900 --> 25:27.569
Lord Commander?

25:53.887 --> 25:55.806
Snow?

25:55.973 --> 25:57.933
Commander!

26:12.489 --> 26:13.907
Move!

26:32.551 --> 26:34.845
What did they do?

26:34.887 --> 26:38.223
[Haesh rakhi davrae zafraan.]
Lamb men make good slaves.

26:38.348 --> 26:41.049
[Khal Drogo vazhoe mora azzafrokea, ]
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers,

26:41.059 --> 26:44.259
[majin azzafroki vazhi kishaan ma hoshor...]
and the slavers will give us gold...

26:46.690 --> 26:50.652
[... ma tasokh ma tawakof.]
...and silk, and steel.

26:50.736 --> 26:54.698
I thought the Dothraki
didn't believe in money.

26:54.823 --> 26:57.868
Gold to hire ships, Princess,

26:57.993 --> 27:00.746
ships to sail to Westeros.

27:16.678 --> 27:19.223
Jorah, make them stop.

27:19.389 --> 27:21.350
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.

27:21.475 --> 27:25.020
These men have shed blood for their khal.
Now they claim their rewards.

27:25.103 --> 27:27.471
[Me vafik, zhey khaleesi.]
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.

27:27.481 --> 27:29.608
[Dothraki chomoe mae.]
The riders do her honour.

27:29.733 --> 27:32.059
[Hash athlaqar mae zireyesee khaleesies,]
if her wailing offends the Khaleesi,

27:32.069 --> 27:34.709
[hash anha afichak shafkea lekh moon.]
I will bring you her tongue.

27:35.822 --> 27:40.035
Princess, you have a gentle heart,
but this is how it's always been.

27:40.160 --> 27:43.038
I do not have a gentle heart, ser.

27:43.956 --> 27:48.036
[Ti mae k'asi, che Khal Drogo anesa valzerikh.]
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.

27:54.713 --> 27:55.513
[Mago!]
Mago!

27:55.713 --> 27:58.413
- [Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.] Only while blood of my blood still lives.
- [Me qorasokh anni!] She is my prize.

27:58.420 --> 27:59.420
Come.

27:59.479 --> 28:03.348
[Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!]
I will take her with an arakh!

28:07.521 --> 28:10.232
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.

28:10.315 --> 28:12.734
And those women there.

28:13.861 --> 28:16.113
You cannot claim them all, Princess.

28:16.196 --> 28:18.448
I can,

28:18.574 --> 28:20.367
and I will.

28:21.118 --> 28:26.658
[Me Fati! Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni]
It's an insult! Khaleesi will give me my prize

28:26.665 --> 28:29.032
[ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!]
or I will take it with my arakh!

28:29.042 --> 28:34.977
[Me vastoe hatif anni; ahhazaan yer nemo vacchaki.]
She will speak before me; until then you will keep yourself quite.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.261
[Zhey jalan atthirari anni,]
Moon of my life,

28:40.387 --> 28:43.467
[Mago asta meshafka fich qorasokh mae,]
Mago says you haven taken his spoils,

28:43.557 --> 28:47.050
[ohara haeshi rakhi fin qoraso me asaja mae.]
a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.

28:47.060 --> 28:49.897
[Asti anhaan hash jini jila.]
Tell me the truth of this.

28:52.149 --> 28:55.809
[Mago asta k'athjilari, zhey shekh ma shieraki anni.]
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.

28:55.819 --> 28:58.937
[Anha ray qoraso san ohari asshekh...]
I have claimed many daughters this day...

28:58.947 --> 29:01.307
[...majin mori nem vos osaji.]
...so they cannot be mounted.

29:04.244 --> 29:06.038
[Jini athvilajerar.]
This is the way of war.

29:06.163 --> 29:08.113
[Jin chiorisi zafra ajjin...]
These women are slaves now...

29:08.123 --> 29:11.418
[...majin kisha ataki morea ven me vallayafa kisha.]
...to do with as we please.

29:12.586 --> 29:14.912
[Anha nem allayafak vassandik mora.]
it pleases me to keep them safe.

29:14.922 --> 29:20.002
[Hash dothraki shafki'th saji mora hash mori jif kemoe ma moroa.]
If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.

29:20.427 --> 29:23.667
[Hash hrazef gova vaf?]
Does the horse mate with the lamb?

29:24.181 --> 29:27.661
[Zhavvorsa vadakhera ma hrazef ma vaf akkate.]
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.

29:28.435 --> 29:29.760
[Yer ifak.]
You are a foreigner.

29:29.770 --> 29:31.855
[Yer assoo anna vosecchi.]
You do not command me.

29:31.980 --> 29:35.859
[Anha Khaleesi. Anha assok yera sekosshi.]
I am Khaleesi. I do command you.

29:38.278 --> 29:40.229
[Tihi kifinosi me ivezhofoe?]
See how fierce she grows?

29:40.239 --> 29:44.775
[Hazak rizh anni mra me: Vezh fini Asaja Rhaesheseres, ]
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world,

29:44.785 --> 29:48.163
[fini nirra mae vorsasoon mae.]
filling her with his fire.

29:49.289 --> 29:51.291
[Anha acharak vos ale.]
I will hear no more.

29:51.375 --> 29:55.202
[Zhey Mago, anha acharak vos ale. Ezas eshna gech ahilee.]
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.

29:55.212 --> 30:00.551
[Khal fines assoe mezhah jahakmeni vos khal.]
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.

30:00.717 --> 30:03.345
[Ohos!]
Be still.

30:04.847 --> 30:06.557
[Os!]
Don't move!

30:12.563 --> 30:16.525
[Anha vazhok khadoes yeroon virsalat.]
I will not have your body burned.

30:16.650 --> 30:20.445
[Anha ochomok yeraan kijinosi.]
I will not give you that honour.

30:24.992 --> 30:27.232
[Inte vadakhie tihoa]
The beetles will feed on your eyes.

30:27.244 --> 30:30.372
[ma khewo afilki vi gadimaan.]
The worms will crawl through your lungs.

30:35.627 --> 30:40.382
[Eyel varthasoe she ilekaan rikhoya arrekaan...]
The rain will fall on your rotting skin...

30:41.884 --> 30:46.054
[...vekha vosi yeroon vosma tolorro!]
...until nothing is left of you but bones!

30:49.141 --> 30:51.301
[Atte yer eth addrivi anna.]
First you have to kill me.

30:51.351 --> 30:52.686
[Jin anha ray et.]
I already have.

31:12.122 --> 31:14.322
[Shekh ma shieraki anni zisa.]
My sun and stars is hurt.

31:14.750 --> 31:16.376
[Me zisosh...]
A scratch...

31:16.502 --> 31:18.160
[...zhey jalan atthirari anni.]
...moon of my life.

31:18.170 --> 31:19.922
[Finne koalaki?]
Where are the healers?

31:21.048 --> 31:23.008
[Jini osto afisi.]
This is the bite of a fly.

31:23.133 --> 31:26.893
[Anha laz rhelak dothrakes vezhvena ha zisoshaan mae.]
I can help the great rider with his cut.

31:27.262 --> 31:31.715
[Qotho speaks Dothraki] ]Khal zigeree vo rhellay ha zafroon fini govi oqet.]
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.

31:31.725 --> 31:34.186
[Me anni. Me vastoe.]
She is mine. Let her speak.

31:34.311 --> 31:36.313
Thank you, silver lady.

31:38.649 --> 31:41.109
Who are you?

31:41.193 --> 31:44.321
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.

31:44.446 --> 31:45.771
[Maegi.]
Witch.

31:45.781 --> 31:48.075
My mother was
godswife here before me.

31:48.158 --> 31:50.994
She taught me how
to make healing smokes and ointments.

31:51.078 --> 31:53.956
All men are of one flock,
so my people believe.

31:54.122 --> 31:56.083
The great shepherd sent me
to earth to heal his...

31:57.543 --> 32:01.743
[Ase sekke. Ase maegi izzi char.]
Too many words. A witch's words poison the ears.

32:02.047 --> 32:03.966
Lamb or lion,

32:04.091 --> 32:08.136
his wound must be washed
and sewn or it will fester.

32:09.596 --> 32:13.090
[Azhas maan affisat zis yeri, shekh ma shieraki anni...]
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars...

32:13.100 --> 32:16.260
[...me azzisa anna jin tihat meyer qiyae.]
...it makes me hurt to see you bleed.

32:37.332 --> 32:42.546
For 30 years I've been making
corpses out of men, boy.

32:42.629 --> 32:45.215
I'm the man you want
leading the vanguard.

32:46.717 --> 32:48.844
Galbart Glover will lead the van.

32:49.636 --> 32:51.555
The bloody wall will melt

32:51.680 --> 32:54.892
before an Umber
marches behind a Glover.

32:55.601 --> 32:59.813
I will lead the van
or I will take my men

32:59.897 --> 33:02.107
and march them home.

33:07.196 --> 33:09.740
You are welcome
to do so, Lord Umber.

33:09.823 --> 33:12.826
And when I am done
with the Lannisters,

33:12.910 --> 33:16.747
I will march back north,
root you out of your keep

33:16.788 --> 33:19.499
and hang you for an oathbreaker.

33:19.917 --> 33:21.960
Oathbreaker, is it?!

33:22.961 --> 33:28.592
I'll not sit here and swallow insults
from a boy so green he pisses grass.

33:42.397 --> 33:44.775
My lord father taught me
it was death to bare steel

33:44.858 --> 33:46.860
against your liege lord.

33:46.985 --> 33:50.989
But doubtless the Greatjon
only meant to cut my meat for me.

33:53.158 --> 33:55.536
Your meat...

34:01.041 --> 34:03.377
is bloody tough.

34:34.116 --> 34:37.578
- What is it? What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.

34:41.915 --> 34:45.043
- Where are you going?
- South. For Father.

34:45.127 --> 34:49.047
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.

34:49.630 --> 34:51.675
I don't want them to know
we're coming.

34:52.509 --> 34:56.554
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.

34:57.598 --> 34:59.725
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.

34:59.808 --> 35:02.978
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...

35:03.061 --> 35:05.647
There must always be
a Stark at Winterfell.

35:06.607 --> 35:08.984
Until I return that will be you.

35:10.944 --> 35:14.781
You are not to leave the castle walls
while we are gone. Do you understand?

35:16.408 --> 35:19.828
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.

35:20.662 --> 35:24.041
- I will.
- I'll send letters whenever I can,

35:24.082 --> 35:28.128
but if you don't hear from me,
don't be scared.

35:33.425 --> 35:35.469
Until I return.

35:55.822 --> 35:59.117
How long have you been
hiding out there?

35:59.284 --> 36:02.329
Robb will be looking for you
to say goodbye.

36:03.747 --> 36:07.334
- They've all gone away.
- They'll be back soon.

36:07.417 --> 36:10.796
Robb will free Father
and they'll come back with Mother.

36:12.673 --> 36:14.967
No, they won't.

36:20.138 --> 36:21.932
Please watch over Robb.

36:22.015 --> 36:25.143
And watch over
all the other men from Winterfell.

36:25.185 --> 36:27.396
And Theon too, I suppose.

36:33.402 --> 36:35.445
You hear them, boy?

36:36.905 --> 36:39.074
The old gods are answering you.

36:39.157 --> 36:43.537
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.

36:46.123 --> 36:49.042
Beyond the Wall,
they're the only gods.

36:49.835 --> 36:53.547
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.

36:56.967 --> 36:59.845
Well, your friend
did put a knife to my throat.

37:00.846 --> 37:03.265
I'm not complaining, little lord,

37:04.474 --> 37:06.476
just telling truths.

37:07.561 --> 37:11.023
What did you mean
about hearing the gods?

37:11.148 --> 37:14.401
You asked them,
they're answering you.

37:15.527 --> 37:17.863
Shh.

37:18.030 --> 37:21.366
Open your ears.

37:24.411 --> 37:26.788
It's only the wind.

37:26.955 --> 37:30.584
Who do you think
sends the wind if not the gods?

37:31.710 --> 37:33.504
They see you, boy.

37:34.296 --> 37:37.090
They hear you.

37:37.257 --> 37:40.469
Your brother will get
no help from them where he's going.

37:40.594 --> 37:43.180
The old gods have
no power in the South.

37:43.263 --> 37:47.017
The weirwoods there were all
cut down a long time ago.

37:47.684 --> 37:49.645
How can they watch
when they have no eyes?

37:52.147 --> 37:56.610
Well, there's a big man.

37:56.735 --> 37:59.863
He has giants' blood
in him or I'm the queen.

38:00.405 --> 38:03.075
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.

38:03.158 --> 38:05.577
- Go dress.
- Hodor.

38:08.747 --> 38:10.874
Are there really giants beyond the wall?

38:12.543 --> 38:15.420
Giants and worse than giants.

38:16.463 --> 38:20.217
I tried telling your brother,
he's marching the wrong way.

38:20.300 --> 38:23.679
All these swords,
they should be going north, boy.

38:23.804 --> 38:25.806
North, not south!

38:28.851 --> 38:32.521
The cold winds are rising.

38:47.744 --> 38:50.873
They were touched by white walkers.

38:50.956 --> 38:53.208
That's why they came back.

38:53.375 --> 38:55.669
That's why their eyes turned blue.

38:56.670 --> 38:58.839
Only fire will stop them.

39:00.883 --> 39:04.428
- How do you know that?
- I read about it in a book...

39:04.511 --> 39:07.514
a very old book
in Maester Aemon's library.

39:10.559 --> 39:14.062
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers

39:14.229 --> 39:17.524
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

39:17.566 --> 39:19.484
And when they wake up...

39:21.028 --> 39:24.281
And when they wake up, what?

39:27.659 --> 39:29.703
I hope the Wall's high enough.

40:02.569 --> 40:04.905
Summer snows, my lady.

40:04.988 --> 40:07.658
Robb's brought the North with him.

40:14.039 --> 40:17.626
The river lords are falling back
with Jaime Lannister at their heels.

40:17.709 --> 40:21.171
And Lord Tywin is bringing around
a second Lannister army from the South.

40:21.296 --> 40:23.841
Our scouts confirm
it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.

40:23.924 --> 40:27.094
One army or two,
the kings in the North

40:27.261 --> 40:30.931
threw back hosts 10 times as large.

40:34.768 --> 40:36.103
Mother!

40:40.983 --> 40:43.151
You look well.

40:43.235 --> 40:47.281
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight
in these troubled times.

40:47.406 --> 40:50.325
We had thought not
to meet you here, my lady.

40:50.450 --> 40:52.744
I had not thought to be here.

40:53.245 --> 40:55.205
I would speak with my son alone.

40:55.330 --> 40:57.583
I know you will forgive me, my lords.

40:57.666 --> 40:59.877
You heard her!
Move your arses!

40:59.918 --> 41:02.254
Come on, out.

41:02.754 --> 41:05.299
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?

41:05.465 --> 41:07.009
Have no fear, my lady.

41:07.092 --> 41:09.720
We'll shove our swords
up Tywin Lannister's bunghole

41:09.803 --> 41:12.556
and then it's on
to the Red Keep to free Ned.

41:13.182 --> 41:15.350
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.

41:15.475 --> 41:17.686
You're not wasting away, are you?

41:29.281 --> 41:32.201
I remember the day
you came into this world,

41:32.284 --> 41:34.828
red-faced and squalling.

41:36.371 --> 41:39.041
And now I find you leading a host to war.

41:40.209 --> 41:42.961
- There was no one else.
- No one?

41:43.045 --> 41:45.130
Who were those men I saw here?

41:45.214 --> 41:49.301
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

41:49.384 --> 41:51.553
If you think you can
send me back to Winterfell...

41:51.720 --> 41:54.014
Oh, would that I could.

41:56.934 --> 41:59.311
There was...

41:59.394 --> 42:01.438
a letter.

42:03.774 --> 42:06.068
From Sansa.

42:06.151 --> 42:08.362
From the queen, you mean.

42:16.495 --> 42:19.540
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.

42:30.133 --> 42:32.970
How many men do you have?

42:33.053 --> 42:35.013
18,000.

42:35.097 --> 42:37.391
If I go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey...

42:37.558 --> 42:40.435
You would never
be allowed to leave. No.

42:40.519 --> 42:44.231
Our best hope,
our only hope,

42:44.398 --> 42:48.735
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if I lose?

42:48.819 --> 42:51.321
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

42:51.405 --> 42:54.616
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.

42:54.825 --> 42:57.119
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.

42:57.160 --> 42:59.746
And the years have not made him kinder.

43:03.125 --> 43:05.252
If you lose,

43:05.377 --> 43:09.339
your father dies, your sisters die,

43:09.464 --> 43:11.508
we die.

43:14.595 --> 43:17.014
Well, that makes it simple, then.

43:17.973 --> 43:19.474
I suppose it does.

43:42.706 --> 43:46.210
From here it might be best
if Bronn and I continue alone.

43:46.251 --> 43:48.629
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.

43:48.712 --> 43:50.506
Not best for me.

43:51.590 --> 43:53.675
If the halfman betrays us,

43:53.800 --> 43:57.554
Shagga, son of Dolf,
will cut off his manhood...

43:57.638 --> 44:00.432
And feed it to the goats, yes.

44:02.267 --> 44:04.811
All right, then.

44:04.937 --> 44:06.980
Time to meet my father.

44:39.680 --> 44:42.015
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.

44:42.182 --> 44:44.017
Father.

44:45.644 --> 44:48.605
The rumours of your demise
were unfounded.

44:49.731 --> 44:52.067
Sorry to disappoint you.

44:52.818 --> 44:54.444
And who are these...

44:54.528 --> 44:56.655
companions of yours?

44:58.657 --> 45:01.743
This is Shagga, son of Dolf,

45:01.827 --> 45:03.871
chieftain of the Stone Crows.

45:04.329 --> 45:08.375
Timett, son of Timett
ruler of the Burned Men.

45:08.834 --> 45:13.297
This fair maid is Chella,
daughter of Cheyk,

45:13.422 --> 45:15.340
leader of the Black Ears.

45:15.424 --> 45:17.843
And here we have Bronn, son of...

45:19.970 --> 45:22.055
You wouldn't know him.

45:23.557 --> 45:26.018
May I present my lord father,

45:26.143 --> 45:28.770
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,

45:28.854 --> 45:32.107
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West?

45:33.817 --> 45:36.278
Kind of you to go to war for me.

45:39.198 --> 45:41.158
You left us no choice.

45:41.283 --> 45:43.577
The honour of the house was at stake.

45:44.536 --> 45:48.040
Your brother would never have
submitted to capture so meekly.

45:48.165 --> 45:50.584
We have our differences, Jaime and I.

45:50.667 --> 45:52.794
He's braver. I'm better-looking.

45:52.878 --> 45:55.464
He's been covering himself in glory.

45:55.506 --> 45:58.300
Jaime smashed the river lords
at the Golden Tooth,

45:58.425 --> 46:02.304
and now lays siege to Riverrun,
Catelyn Stark's homeland.

46:02.429 --> 46:05.349
- And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.

46:05.766 --> 46:08.435
He will lead no armies
from his dungeon cell.

46:08.519 --> 46:12.439
How did my sweet sister persuade the king
to imprison his dear friend Ned?

46:12.564 --> 46:17.319
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

46:19.738 --> 46:22.032
My sister rules, you mean.

46:22.115 --> 46:24.284
Stark's son has called his banners.

46:24.743 --> 46:28.705
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.

46:28.789 --> 46:32.626
One taste of battle and he'll run back
to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.

46:33.919 --> 46:38.423
Maybe. Though the boy does have
a certain belligerence.

46:38.549 --> 46:40.175
You'd like him.

46:41.218 --> 46:45.222
While we're on the subject of war,

46:45.389 --> 46:47.391
I made promises to my friends here,

46:47.474 --> 46:49.852
and a Lannister always pays his debts.

46:49.977 --> 46:52.855
We shall require
3,000 helms and shields,

46:52.980 --> 46:55.065
plus swords, pikes,

46:55.190 --> 46:57.025
gorgets, maces...

46:57.943 --> 47:00.404
if it please my lord,
Ser Addam bids me report

47:00.529 --> 47:02.990
that the northmen
have crossed the Neck.

47:05.117 --> 47:08.745
The wolf rushes
into the lion's jaws. So be it.

47:08.871 --> 47:12.040
Kevan, command
the drummers beat assembly.

47:13.542 --> 47:16.503
And send word to Jaime
that I am moving against Robb Stark.

47:16.628 --> 47:18.505
At once, my lord.

47:31.185 --> 47:34.313
It is said that the men
of the mountain clans are great warriors.

47:34.438 --> 47:36.190
Ride with me against my enemies

47:36.315 --> 47:39.109
and you shall have
all my son promised you and more.

47:39.193 --> 47:41.570
Only if the halfman fights with us.

47:41.695 --> 47:44.323
Until we hold the steel he pledged us,

47:44.990 --> 47:47.868
the little lion's life is ours.

47:53.165 --> 47:56.168
The scouts report
Lord Tywin moves north.

47:56.293 --> 47:59.213
We need to get him on broken ground,
put his knights at a disadvantage.

47:59.338 --> 48:04.301
No, we need to get around him and break
Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

48:04.426 --> 48:07.221
Do that and the river lords will join us.

48:07.304 --> 48:10.933
To do either we need to cross the river
and the only crossing is at the Twins.

48:11.016 --> 48:14.436
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.

48:14.561 --> 48:17.814
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.

48:17.856 --> 48:21.693
At the Trident, he didn't appear
until the battle was done.

48:21.818 --> 48:25.739
Some men take their oaths
more seriously than others.

48:32.829 --> 48:35.457
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.

48:35.582 --> 48:37.668
So what's it going to be?

48:37.793 --> 48:41.505
Do we move against
Jaime or Lord Tywin?

48:45.759 --> 48:49.388
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.

48:51.348 --> 48:54.601
Don't worry, lad. He won't be
leaving this tent with his head.

48:56.103 --> 48:59.898
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.

48:59.940 --> 49:02.150
He looked to be counting.

49:12.286 --> 49:13.954
How high did you get?

49:16.415 --> 49:19.168
20,000. Maybe more.

49:19.251 --> 49:22.754
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...

49:22.838 --> 49:26.842
My father understands mercy,
when there is room for it.

49:28.719 --> 49:31.471
And he understands honour...

49:32.848 --> 49:35.100
and courage.

49:37.144 --> 49:39.354
Let him go.

49:39.938 --> 49:42.149
Robb.

49:54.286 --> 49:57.664
Tell Lord Tywin
winter is coming for him.

49:57.789 --> 50:02.169
20,000 northerners marching south
to find out if he really does shit gold.

50:04.254 --> 50:06.548
Yes, my lord.

50:06.632 --> 50:08.675
Thank you, my lord.

50:17.184 --> 50:20.938
Are you touched, boy?!
Letting him go?

50:21.063 --> 50:22.689
You call me boy again.

50:24.358 --> 50:25.901
Go on.

50:43.460 --> 50:45.462
Oi.

50:51.385 --> 50:54.263
It is also the wish of His Grace

50:54.388 --> 50:58.308
that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,

50:59.476 --> 51:02.229
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.

51:02.312 --> 51:06.942
...be at once raised to the rank of lord...

51:07.109 --> 51:08.360
Lord Gyles.

51:08.485 --> 51:11.780
...and granted
the ancient seat of Harrenhal,

51:11.864 --> 51:15.450
and that his sons and grandsons
shall hold this honour

51:15.534 --> 51:20.455
after him until the end of time.

51:23.917 --> 51:28.005
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark,

51:28.130 --> 51:32.426
it is the wish of His Grace
that Tywin Lannister,

51:32.551 --> 51:36.972
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West,

51:37.139 --> 51:40.350
be appointed Hand of the King.

51:40.434 --> 51:42.352
Lastly,

51:42.477 --> 51:45.272
in these times of treason and turmoil,

51:45.314 --> 51:48.400
it is the view of council

51:48.483 --> 51:51.570
that the life and safety

51:51.653 --> 51:53.614
of King Joffrey

51:53.697 --> 51:57.868
be of paramount importance.

51:59.453 --> 52:02.039
Ser Barristan Selmy.

52:08.545 --> 52:11.924
Your Grace,
I am yours to command.

52:12.049 --> 52:14.009
Rise, Ser Barristan.

52:14.885 --> 52:16.970
You may remove your helm.

52:22.142 --> 52:24.645
You have served the realm
long and faithfully.

52:24.770 --> 52:28.524
Every man and woman
in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.

52:28.607 --> 52:31.944
But it is time to put aside
your armour and your sword.

52:32.069 --> 52:34.821
It is time to rest
and look back with pride

52:34.905 --> 52:37.824
on your many years of service.

52:38.742 --> 52:41.245
Your Grace, the Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

52:41.370 --> 52:45.874
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.

52:45.999 --> 52:49.795
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?

52:50.629 --> 52:52.548
You let my father die.

52:52.631 --> 52:55.509
You're too old to protect anybody.

52:58.345 --> 53:00.514
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined

53:00.597 --> 53:03.058
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

53:03.183 --> 53:06.895
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade

53:07.020 --> 53:09.064
with the blood of the king
he had sworn to defend!

53:09.147 --> 53:11.066
Careful, ser.

53:11.191 --> 53:15.279
We have nothing but gratitude
for your long service, good ser.

53:15.404 --> 53:17.906
You shall be given
a stout keep beside the sea,

53:17.990 --> 53:20.742
with servants
to look after your every need.

53:20.868 --> 53:24.830
A hall to die in
and men to bury me.

53:26.999 --> 53:29.459
I am a knight.

53:29.543 --> 53:32.588
I shall die a knight.

53:38.594 --> 53:40.637
A naked knight, apparently.

53:51.857 --> 53:55.694
Even now I could cut through
the five of you like carving a cake!

53:59.698 --> 54:01.950
Here, boy!

54:02.075 --> 54:04.703
Melt it down and add it to the others.

54:21.011 --> 54:23.263
If any man in this hall
has other matters

54:23.347 --> 54:27.059
to set before His Grace,
let him speak now

54:27.184 --> 54:29.686
or go forth and hold his silence.

54:32.898 --> 54:34.650
Your Grace.

54:35.776 --> 54:37.819
Come forward, my lady.

54:38.779 --> 54:41.698
The Lady Sansa
of House Stark.

54:42.783 --> 54:46.370
Do you have some business
for the king and the council, Sansa?

54:46.954 --> 54:48.413
I do.

54:53.085 --> 54:56.755
As it please Your Grace,
I ask mercy for my father,

54:56.839 --> 54:59.424
Lord Eddard Stark,
who was Hand of the King.

54:59.550 --> 55:02.719
Treason is a noxious weed.

55:03.303 --> 55:06.849
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.

55:06.932 --> 55:09.685
I want to hear what she says.

55:09.977 --> 55:11.728
Thank you, Your Grace.

55:11.812 --> 55:14.356
Do you deny your father's crime?

55:14.439 --> 55:18.235
No, my lords.
I know he must be punished.

55:19.236 --> 55:20.988
All I ask is mercy.

55:21.488 --> 55:23.782
I know my lord father
must regret what he did.

55:23.907 --> 55:25.909
He was King Robert's friend
and he loved him.

55:25.993 --> 55:27.703
You all know he loved him.

55:28.453 --> 55:32.499
He never wanted to be Hand
until the king asked him.

55:32.583 --> 55:36.378
They must have lied to him -
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.

55:36.503 --> 55:38.338
They must have lied!

55:38.839 --> 55:40.883
He said I wasn't the king.

55:41.758 --> 55:45.179
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.

55:45.304 --> 55:48.265
Maester Pycelle
was giving him milk of the poppy.

55:48.348 --> 55:52.186
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.

55:54.188 --> 55:56.231
A child's faith.

55:56.356 --> 55:58.650
Such sweet innocence.

55:59.276 --> 56:03.530
And yet they say wisdom
oft comes from the mouths of babes.

56:03.989 --> 56:08.160
Treason is treason!

56:11.413 --> 56:13.498
Anything else?

56:15.042 --> 56:18.837
If you still have any affection
in your heart for me,

56:18.921 --> 56:22.021
please do me this kindness, Your Grace.

56:31.725 --> 56:33.852
Your sweet words have moved me.

56:35.979 --> 56:38.899
But your father has to confess.

56:39.024 --> 56:42.444
He has to confess
and say that I'm the king...

56:45.030 --> 56:47.449
or there'll be no mercy for him.

56:52.079 --> 56:54.122
He will.

56:55.079 --> 57:00.122
BURN ALL THE WITCHES AND THAT ASSHOLE; JOFFREY!!!
