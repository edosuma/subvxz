00:37.540 --> 00:40.355
~ This is a man's world ~

00:40.459 --> 00:46.186
~ But it would be nothing
without a woman or a girl... ~

01:30.274 --> 01:33.144
Ready or not, here comes mama.

I'm gonna make my lips
even more bee-stung.

04:22.098 --> 04:26.917
I'm taking my face to Sweden
to win the Nobel Peace Prize.

04:27.021 --> 04:30.666
Ain't nobody here tonight
winning Miss Congeniality.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.367
Ladies, five minutes.

04:40.756 --> 04:44.852

Owwww!

05:19.486 --> 05:22.332
~... and the lady is mine ~

05:23.090 --> 05:26.560
~ Mine, all mine, oh
Well, she's never in the way ~

05:26.664 --> 05:30.354
~ Always something nice to say
Oh, what a blessing ~

05:30.458 --> 05:32.441
~ What a blessing ~

05:32.545 --> 05:34.648
~ I can leave her on her own ~

05:34.752 --> 05:38.362
~ She's OK alone
and there's no messing ~

05:38.466 --> 05:40.071
~ No messing ~

05:40.175 --> 05:42.869
~ She's a lady ~

05:42.973 --> 05:45.897
~ Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady ~

05:47.030 --> 05:49.984
~ Talkin' about that little lady ~

05:51.702 --> 05:55.210
~ And the lady is mine ~

05:55.315 --> 05:56.799
~ Mine, all mine, oh ~

05:56.904 --> 06:00.970
~ Well, she never asks very much
and I don't refuse her ~

06:01.075 --> 06:05.014
~ Always treat her with respect
I never would abuse her ~

06:05.118 --> 06:09.225
~ What she's got is hard to find
and I don't want to lose her ~

06:09.330 --> 06:15.922
~ Help me build a mountain
from a little pile of clay ~

06:17.185 --> 06:20.111
~ She's a lady ~

06:20.216 --> 06:23.659
~ Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady ~

06:23.763 --> 06:27.185
~ Talkin' about the little lady ~

06:28.655 --> 06:32.413
~ And the lady is mine ~

06:32.517 --> 06:36.075
Hello, hello, hello!
Good evening.

06:37.164 --> 06:42.668
And here to present
this year's Drag Queen Of The Year...

06:43.754 --> 06:45.886
last year's winner.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.346
Put your hands together for

06:48.450 --> 06:53.004
Miss Rachel Tensions!

07:08.487 --> 07:10.859
Hello!

07:11.698 --> 07:13.490
Oh!

07:14.618 --> 07:16.129
Oh!

07:16.233 --> 07:20.247
What can I say? My heart is full.

07:25.629 --> 07:29.212
- I love you!
- Oh, thank you.

07:33.804 --> 07:35.512
Mama!

07:42.521 --> 07:46.490
Well, well.
Here we all are again.

07:46.595 --> 07:49.160
Another year flies by

07:49.264 --> 07:52.652
and it's time to crown
a new Drag Queen Of The Year.

07:54.491 --> 07:56.623
Proof that in New York City

07:56.728 --> 07:59.544
a thing of beauty is a joy

07:59.648 --> 08:02.195
for exactly 12 months.

08:04.710 --> 08:07.960
May I have the envelope, please?

08:11.842 --> 08:15.645
Mmm-mmm. I don't know who he is

08:15.749 --> 08:20.846
but if there's a snowstorm tonight,
he's going on my tyres.

08:24.271 --> 08:27.158
The winner
of the Drag Queen Of The Year

08:27.262 --> 08:32.366
will receive an all-expense-paid,
round-trip ticket

08:32.471 --> 08:34.734
to Hollywood, California!

08:37.868 --> 08:43.241
Where she can compete
in the Drag Queen Of America contest.

08:45.417 --> 08:48.252
I'm so excited I could just spit.

08:50.339 --> 08:52.497
And the winner is...

08:53.592 --> 08:56.261
We have a tie!

08:57.387 --> 09:00.275
- Tie? What's she mean, tie?
- Oh, my God.

09:00.379 --> 09:03.108
- And the winners are...
- Me...

09:03.212 --> 09:07.948
Miss Noxeema Jackson
and Miss Vida Boheme!

09:08.052 --> 09:13.100
Work the runway, work it!
To the future, diva women!

09:14.112 --> 09:16.188
Come, come.

09:27.668 --> 09:31.886
Now, go and scandalise
this country, girlfriends.

09:31.991 --> 09:35.130
This land was made for you and her.

10:04.496 --> 10:07.006
Us in Hollywood?
This is total glam.

10:07.110 --> 10:09.675
I just hope nobody
mistakes us for the Gabors.

10:09.779 --> 10:14.847
- We'll be seen at the China Bowl.
- We will induce envy and rage.

10:14.951 --> 10:18.226
Look. That little Latin boy
in drag is crying.

10:18.331 --> 10:22.649
Find out why
that little Latin boy in drag is crying.

10:22.753 --> 10:25.648
Little Latin boy in drag,

10:25.753 --> 10:28.191
why are you crying?

10:28.295 --> 10:32.950
Cos... It's just cos the two of you
are so pretty, you know?

10:33.054 --> 10:35.284
- That's all?
- Of course we're pretty

10:35.388 --> 10:37.742
but why are you crying?

10:37.846 --> 10:41.291
Maybe she just found out
Menudo broke up.

10:41.395 --> 10:43.857
Now, little one, what is your name?

10:44.953 --> 10:47.954
It's Chi Chi. Chi Chi Rodriguez.

10:49.041 --> 10:53.221
- What's with the waterworks?
- I wanted to win this so much

10:53.325 --> 10:57.136
because I never won nothing.
Every time that I do something,

10:57.240 --> 11:01.229
I get it wrong and somebody's
always laughing at me.

11:01.333 --> 11:05.228
But maybe I'll meet somebody nice
who will rescue me,

11:05.332 --> 11:09.320
instead of old men
with their greasy bellies and their money

11:09.425 --> 11:12.487
and their...
and leaving when the time is up.

11:12.591 --> 11:15.407
But, no, I'm a loser.
That's why. I'm a loser.

11:15.511 --> 11:18.493
I hate my life, I hate myself,
I hate everything!

11:18.597 --> 11:22.615
Listen, listen. You are a winner.
You look like...

11:23.450 --> 11:27.578
Well, you are a winner and...

11:29.873 --> 11:32.594
- Don't be looking at me.
- Noxeema!

11:32.698 --> 11:36.554
Don't be giving me that
bleeding-heart Sally Struthers look.

11:36.658 --> 11:39.140
Chi Chi, you just sit right here.

11:39.244 --> 11:42.558
I am going upstairs
to have a talk with Miss Noxeema.

11:42.662 --> 11:45.978
- We will be right back.
- I'm not going upstairs with you.

11:46.082 --> 11:48.898
I ain't driving you no more, Miss Daisy.

11:49.003 --> 11:52.234
Noxeema, we must all help others.

11:52.338 --> 11:54.950
- How?
- Take her with us to Hollywood.

11:55.055 --> 11:57.322
- Say what?
- Take her with us.

11:57.427 --> 12:00.204
- How are we gonna do that?
- Erm...

12:00.309 --> 12:03.288
Sell our plane tickets
and the three of us go by bus.

12:03.392 --> 12:08.416
Uh-uh-uh. Not on your young,
queer life. You and your causes.

12:08.520 --> 12:13.342
That child is Latin. You don't
want to get mixed up in that mess.

12:13.446 --> 12:15.676
She might be a Sandinista.

12:15.780 --> 12:19.178
Noxeema Jackson,
I must admit that I am shocked

12:19.282 --> 12:23.059
and just a little bit saddened by you.
You, of all people.

12:23.163 --> 12:26.976
I remember the first time
that I laid eyes

12:27.080 --> 12:30.442
on a certain young
ebony enchantress in the rough

12:30.546 --> 12:34.236
and how, through styling
and the occasional make-up tip,

12:34.341 --> 12:38.282
I helped her look just a little bit
less like Moms Mabley.

12:38.386 --> 12:41.994
- Moms Mabley?
- And who'd think that enchantress

12:42.098 --> 12:45.496
would one day share a title with moi?

12:45.600 --> 12:49.499
Now, on those steps,
that dear little Spanish soul,

12:49.603 --> 12:53.630
working that tired Abbe Lane drag
for all it's worth

12:53.734 --> 12:55.783
is all alone in this world.

12:56.752 --> 13:00.471
And she just once
wants to be special,

13:00.575 --> 13:04.056
to have a moment in the starlight,

13:04.160 --> 13:08.511
to dream of being
utterly, utterly fabulous.

13:13.977 --> 13:16.931
- Hello!
- I'm walking here! I'm walking here!

13:17.731 --> 13:22.642
Now, the China Bowl is the place
if you want to be outrageous.

13:28.075 --> 13:31.961
What stunning visions! Tell us
your beauty secrets or we'll die.

13:32.065 --> 13:35.840
Darling, I cannot be held responsible
for that.

13:35.944 --> 13:38.509
- I wish I was as beautiful as you.
- Honey!

13:38.613 --> 13:41.041
Good luck. Come on, honey.

13:45.217 --> 13:47.293
Thank you.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.979
- They really like us.
- Love...

13:53.083 --> 13:55.523
Delighted to meet us!

13:55.627 --> 13:57.891
Vida! Hi.

13:59.064 --> 14:04.243
Excuse me. Oh, Vida, Vida!
Che bellissima. Come va?

14:04.347 --> 14:06.644
Darling, enchantÃ©.

14:07.656 --> 14:10.204
Oh, you spoke French. How bi.

14:10.309 --> 14:13.420
Look at you, my little piÃ±ata.
How are you?

14:13.524 --> 14:18.130
The only man of money matters,
Mr John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.

14:18.234 --> 14:22.178
- Â¡Ay, tan chulo! El gusto es mio.
- No, no. El gusto es mio.

14:22.282 --> 14:24.470
No, papito, el gusto es mio.

14:24.574 --> 14:26.597
- See that?
- El gusto es mio.

14:26.701 --> 14:28.602
Si te ajusto las nalgas...

14:28.706 --> 14:31.648
You remember
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.

14:31.752 --> 14:35.358
- His name is my name, too.
- Do people shout? I hate that.

14:35.462 --> 14:38.276
Look at you!
I'm like a compass near north.

14:38.380 --> 14:42.028
- Congratulations on your victoire.
- Thank you.

14:42.132 --> 14:44.745
Now, we must talk.
We have une petite crise.

14:44.849 --> 14:49.204
- Crise? Oh, jamais.
- We have decided

14:49.308 --> 14:54.127
to take our young protÃ©gÃ©,
Miss Chi Chi, to Hollywood with us.

14:54.232 --> 14:56.923
- How Three Sisters. How Chekhov.
- We?

14:57.027 --> 14:59.462
- What part do I play?
- Two round trips to LA.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.006
- To have or to dump?
- To dump.

15:02.110 --> 15:05.222
~ To-dump, to-dump,
to dump-dump-dump ~

15:05.326 --> 15:08.268
- One thousand.
- That is fabulous.

15:08.372 --> 15:11.812
- Then three round trips to LA.
- Mode of transportation?

15:11.916 --> 15:14.103
- Cheapest.
- Oh, well, mule!

15:14.207 --> 15:16.524
Sorry, darling. Forgive me.

15:16.628 --> 15:19.858
- You've got her number.
- Let's say bus.

15:19.963 --> 15:24.449
I do not do the bus. You have me
mistaken for Miss Rosa Parks.

15:24.554 --> 15:28.827
Ixnay on the Hound, then.
How about chemin de fer? Train.

15:28.931 --> 15:32.496
- Oh, yes! Does it have a club car?
- How much?

15:32.600 --> 15:36.960
Let's see. Three round-trip tickets,
two adults, one child...

15:37.064 --> 15:39.214
Tell me, does it have a club car?

15:39.318 --> 15:42.132
1,500?

15:42.236 --> 15:45.551
That is totally out of our league.
What else can we do?

15:45.655 --> 15:48.305
On account of your need
and unprecedented glamour,

15:48.410 --> 15:51.058
today you're the lucky winner of...

15:51.163 --> 15:55.731
- Can we pay in trade?
- It's English, darling. Noxee.

15:55.835 --> 15:59.148
"Crazy Elijah -
my cars are my children."

15:59.252 --> 16:02.402
Drop my name,
anything on the lot - $50.

16:02.506 --> 16:07.159
- Problem solved. A lifesaver.
- Are we driving to Los Angeles?

16:07.263 --> 16:09.660
- Cherry Lifesaver.
- All-day sucker.

16:09.764 --> 16:13.917
Are we discussing driving
from New York to Los Angeles?

16:14.021 --> 16:17.877
Don't start with me. We will go on.
I've got to go. Bye!

16:17.981 --> 16:23.260
This America does not
respond kindly to our sort of person.

16:23.365 --> 16:26.342
No one say anything frivolous
for a few moments,

16:26.447 --> 16:28.885
I am having a significant experience.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.558
Whoopee

16:30.662 --> 16:36.227
Miss Julie Newmar has been watching
silently over this conversation.

16:36.332 --> 16:39.359
And look at her, vintage Miss Julie.

16:39.463 --> 16:42.849
She is the perfect,
the ultimate... Oh!

16:43.937 --> 16:47.612
Describe her
and do not use the word "statuesque".

16:47.716 --> 16:53.081
Miss Julie, you are statuesque
and you were the only Cat Woman.

16:53.185 --> 16:55.581
- Read it, please.
- "To Wong Foo,

16:55.685 --> 16:58.628
"thanks for everything,
Julie Newmar."

16:58.732 --> 17:02.837
- Who was Wong Foo?
- I don't know but they were close.

17:02.942 --> 17:04.675
I'm hungry.

17:04.780 --> 17:09.845
We must take this message across
the land as our sovereign token.

17:09.950 --> 17:12.098
Let's just relax.

17:12.203 --> 17:16.809
I was back in the club car,
now we're driving across America.

17:16.913 --> 17:21.067
Â¡Ay, nenita! Look! Look at this!
Look what I found.

17:21.171 --> 17:23.651
Golly, golly, golly!

17:23.755 --> 17:27.445
- The seats are like butter.
- Now this is a car.

17:27.550 --> 17:31.115
A car? Mary Alice Louise, no.
This is a land yacht.

17:31.219 --> 17:34.867
I used to know a lawyer guy
who had a car just like this

17:34.972 --> 17:38.333
and I said then and there
I'd have one for myself.

17:38.438 --> 17:41.462
- Can we have this?
- But we daren't.

17:41.567 --> 17:44.257
I feel like Miss Jayne Mansfield
in this.

17:44.361 --> 17:46.712
Ooh! Not a good auto reference.

17:46.817 --> 17:49.512
Please, it's a wreck. Ladies.

17:49.616 --> 17:53.915
Be careful with the...
It'll never get you to California!

17:55.342 --> 17:59.855
- It's the look!
- Noxee, how can you possibly refuse?

17:59.959 --> 18:02.901
Internal combustion,
the ultimate accessory.

18:03.005 --> 18:08.109
Ladies, please, for your own safety,
go with the Toyota Corolla.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.992
It comes down to
that age-old decision.

18:11.096 --> 18:12.532
Style...

18:12.636 --> 18:15.147
or substance?

18:16.989 --> 18:19.314
Hmm...

18:27.708 --> 18:29.581
~ Gotta move ~

18:30.919 --> 18:32.793
~ Gotta get out ~

18:33.839 --> 18:36.477
~ Gotta leave this place ~

18:36.581 --> 18:39.559
~ Gotta find some place ~

18:39.663 --> 18:42.940
~ Some other place
Some brand new place ~

18:43.044 --> 18:47.150
~ Some place where each face that
I see won't be staring back at me ~

18:47.254 --> 18:49.144
~ Telling me what to be
and how to be it ~

18:49.479 --> 18:54.391
~ Some place where I can just be me ~

18:55.736 --> 18:57.609
~ Gotta move ~

18:58.780 --> 19:00.497
~ Gotta get out... ~

19:00.601 --> 19:04.499
Let me ask you something.
We just left Philadelphia, right?

19:04.603 --> 19:09.379
- So the next city is...
- Bala Cynwyd.

19:09.484 --> 19:13.050
- Bala Cynwyd. It's Welsh.
- That's right.

19:13.154 --> 19:16.969
- How do you know that?
- How did you know that?

19:17.074 --> 19:19.725
Believe it or not, it's my hometown.

19:19.830 --> 19:23.227
- Get out!
- Oh, my goodness! I want to see!

19:23.331 --> 19:28.068
- I wanna see where she was birthed!
- The birthplace of Miss Vida Boheme.

19:28.172 --> 19:31.697
There's got to be
a historical marker or something.

19:31.801 --> 19:37.328
~... when I find me that new place,
maybe ours ~

19:37.433 --> 19:39.119
~ Gotta leave this town ~

19:39.223 --> 19:41.039
~ Gotta leave this place ~

19:41.144 --> 19:47.209
~ Gotta find a new man ~

19:47.313 --> 19:49.410
~ Gotta move ~

19:54.086 --> 19:58.249
Welcome to Bala Cynwyd.
It's so beautiful!

19:59.591 --> 20:04.937
Here, they made me stop being Esther
Williams in Million Dollar Mermaid,

20:05.041 --> 20:08.189
thus marring
the Methodist annual picnic.

20:08.294 --> 20:11.608
How come you never told us
you were rich?

20:11.713 --> 20:16.533
- I'm not rich, my parents are.
- You gave all this up?

20:16.637 --> 20:19.867
There will be a barbecue
at Twelve Oaks tonight.

20:19.971 --> 20:23.415
We were so poor my parents
got married for the rice.

20:23.519 --> 20:25.539
Why did you give this up?

20:25.643 --> 20:29.042
- Vida gave all this up to be Vida.
- Hello.

20:29.147 --> 20:32.341
Next time you give something like
this up, call me, I'll take it.

20:32.445 --> 20:34.593
There. There.

20:34.697 --> 20:38.796
Â¡Ay, mama! Look!

20:45.804 --> 20:48.924
Fabulous. Simply fabulous.

21:04.197 --> 21:06.246
Maps are cheating.

21:06.351 --> 21:09.295
Don't do that! What are you doing?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.445
Go back!

21:12.289 --> 21:16.951
Oh, Jesus.
Vida, this is unbecoming of a lady.

21:25.010 --> 21:27.558
How are we gonna know
where we're going?

21:27.663 --> 21:31.357
- Instincts, my dear.
- And exquisite wit.

21:31.461 --> 21:35.025
To become a drag queen,
you have to learn these things.

21:35.129 --> 21:39.155
What do you mean, "be a drag queen"?
I am a drag queen.

21:39.260 --> 21:43.444
Oh, child, no. You are, simply put,
a boy in a dress.

21:44.404 --> 21:47.624
When a straight man puts on a dress
to get kicks,

21:47.728 --> 21:49.748
he is a transvestite.

21:49.852 --> 21:52.464
When a man is a woman
trapped in a man's body

21:52.569 --> 21:55.757
and has the little operation,
he is a transsexual.

21:55.862 --> 21:58.132
- I know that.
- When a gay man

21:58.236 --> 22:03.683
has way too much fashion sense
for one gender, he is a drag queen.

22:03.787 --> 22:04.929
Thank you.

22:05.033 --> 22:10.429
And when a tired Latin boy puts on
a dress, he is simply a boy in a dress.

22:13.266 --> 22:16.902
- I'm just a boy in a dress?
- Definitely.

22:17.007 --> 22:21.724
OK, OK, that's it.
That does it. I'm history.

22:23.944 --> 22:29.334
Maybe there is a place for somebody
like me but I don't need that.

22:29.438 --> 22:31.124
She running across the border.

22:31.228 --> 22:34.755
You have huge potential
and you are squandering it!

22:34.859 --> 22:36.673
What do you care?

22:36.778 --> 22:40.052
Yes, you will start off
a mere boy in a dress.

22:40.156 --> 22:42.636
But when we are done
with this crusade,

22:42.741 --> 22:44.762
Auntie Vida and Auntie Noxee

22:44.866 --> 22:49.187
will give you the outrageous outlook
and indomitable spirit

22:49.291 --> 22:52.630
that it will take to make you
a full-fledged drag queen.

22:54.224 --> 22:58.655
So now, I want you to turn
your sway-backed little self around

22:58.759 --> 23:03.225
on those Robert Clergerie knockoffs
and get back in this car.

23:04.526 --> 23:06.685
Maybe I'm not just a boy in a dress.

23:11.450 --> 23:15.032
All right. You are a drag princess.

23:16.038 --> 23:18.797
I could live with that.
I'm a princess.

23:18.901 --> 23:23.176
P to the R to the IN
to the CESS! I'm a princess!

23:23.280 --> 23:27.305
- Are you all right?
- You gotta like! Princess Chi Chi.

23:27.409 --> 23:30.353
That's fine
but you still have a lot to learn

23:30.457 --> 23:33.065
before you're a full-fledged queen.

23:33.169 --> 23:36.064
Can I stay a princess?
They're younger.

23:36.168 --> 23:40.654
Does everything have to be a joke?
This is not a masquerade, it's real.

23:40.758 --> 23:43.449
There are steps to becoming a queen.

23:43.554 --> 23:46.228
I'm sorry. How many?

23:48.153 --> 23:51.985
Four. There are four steps
to becoming a drag queen.

23:53.075 --> 23:55.207
Tell me, what are they?

23:55.311 --> 23:59.127
Patience, ma chÃ©rie.
You will know when you've done them.

23:59.231 --> 24:03.047
Miss Noxeema,
our duchess of protocol, will inform you.

24:03.151 --> 24:08.261
Just pay attention. Auntie
Vida will make you a big old queen.

24:08.365 --> 24:11.394
God grant me the serenity
to accept being a boy in a dress,

24:11.498 --> 24:15.309
the courage to change with the fashions
and the wisdom to know the difference.

24:15.414 --> 24:18.314
Congratulations, Miss Rodriguez.

24:18.419 --> 24:21.945
That was step number one
towards true queenliness.

24:22.049 --> 24:24.069
Step one already!

24:24.173 --> 24:27.451
Let good thoughts
be your sword and shield.

24:27.555 --> 24:30.702
~ Take a look at yourself
What do you see? ~

24:30.806 --> 24:34.454
~ A willing victim of mediocrity ~

24:34.558 --> 24:38.668
~ No one told you
you can't have it all ~

24:38.772 --> 24:42.215
~ It's time to act up
and have a ball ~

24:42.320 --> 24:45.245
~ You've got to be yourself
Gonna change that vibe... ~

24:46.878 --> 24:49.472
I'm so tired,
I wish I were dead.

24:49.576 --> 24:52.640
We all tired, honey.

24:52.745 --> 24:55.099
We're gonna have to stop sometime.

24:55.203 --> 24:58.271
I know. I've just
sort of been postponing it.

24:58.375 --> 25:00.637
Stop torturing us.

25:04.646 --> 25:06.188
OK.

25:16.408 --> 25:19.295
Budget Hosts are really good,
I'm serious.

25:19.400 --> 25:22.923
You can keep the mints
even if you don't stay all night.

25:23.027 --> 25:25.546
It's a Budget Host.

25:25.651 --> 25:28.802
I don't know.
It's just so Middle America.

25:28.906 --> 25:31.888
- Why don't we sleep in the car?
- Oh, please

25:31.992 --> 25:34.014
I've got to sleep in a real bed.

25:34.118 --> 25:39.061
People are gonna be cruel, maybe
violent. We have been there before.

25:39.165 --> 25:43.109
Let's throw you two a pity party.
Two fraidy old ladies.

25:43.213 --> 25:46.361
- What is she doing?
- Live life before it lives you.

25:46.465 --> 25:48.903
- She'll get herself killed.
- When?

25:49.007 --> 25:51.953
Gonna be second-rate your whole life.

25:52.057 --> 25:53.909
Please get in this car.

25:54.013 --> 25:57.246
I'm not sleeping with
the Wicked Witch Of The West.

25:57.350 --> 25:59.040
Chi Chi, please!

25:59.144 --> 26:02.376
I need some sleep tonight, OK?

26:02.480 --> 26:05.712
- Take a picture, it'll last longer.
- We have to go get her. Let's go.

26:05.817 --> 26:08.429
Why do you always do this to me?

26:08.533 --> 26:11.805
- Ridiculous. A bunch of wet rags.
- She's crazy.

26:11.909 --> 26:15.100
We're staying in this no-tell motel
so be quiet.

26:15.204 --> 26:19.938
- I should have met you outside.
- It's OK, Mr Manager.

26:20.042 --> 26:22.523
We came in for a little sanctuary.

26:22.627 --> 26:25.986
- Welcome.
- Welcome?

26:26.090 --> 26:30.074
- There's wine and cheese.
- I love to be wined and dined.

26:30.179 --> 26:32.869
You'll meet many
of your friends inside.

26:32.973 --> 26:35.536
Friends?

26:35.640 --> 26:39.287
Get with the programme. No one is
so rich as to throw away a friend.

26:39.391 --> 26:41.543
Is there a drag ball going on?

26:41.647 --> 26:44.295
Basketball?

26:44.399 --> 26:46.944
I'll be centre,
you be cheerleader.

26:49.251 --> 26:51.510
Come on, over here!

26:51.615 --> 26:54.338
- I'm open.
- Move the ball around.

26:59.219 --> 27:00.963
Yeah!

27:09.563 --> 27:12.111
Miss Chi Chi, I must commend you

27:12.215 --> 27:14.739
on your entrance
into this establishment.

27:14.843 --> 27:19.082
Oooh! Absolutely.
Step two, big time.

27:19.186 --> 27:22.914
Halfway towards
utter, utter fabulousness.

27:23.018 --> 27:26.585
Step two to becoming a queen -
ignore adversity.

27:26.689 --> 27:29.154
- Toast to Miss Chi Chi.
- We salute you.

27:45.807 --> 27:47.883
~ Oh, she's a brick ~

27:48.977 --> 27:50.851
~ House ~

27:51.897 --> 27:55.533
~ She's mighty, mighty
Just lettin' it all hang out ~

27:55.637 --> 27:57.952
~ She's a brick ~

27:58.056 --> 27:59.577
~ House ~

27:59.682 --> 28:02.996
~ I like ladies stacked
And that's a fact ~

28:03.101 --> 28:06.833
~ Ain't holding nothing back
Oh, she's a brick ~

28:06.937 --> 28:08.339
~ House ~

28:08.444 --> 28:11.384
~ Yeah, she's the one
The only one ~

28:11.488 --> 28:13.332
~ Built like an Amazon... ~

28:23.345 --> 28:27.888
"Lost in the hot embrace
of Damien's sinewy bronze flesh,

28:28.809 --> 28:32.279
"Laritza surrendered
her body completely..."

28:32.383 --> 28:33.526
Oh!

28:33.630 --> 28:37.907
"melting with every touch
of his insatiable lipses."

28:38.012 --> 28:39.977
Oh, stop. My nerves.

28:41.071 --> 28:43.120
Where the freak are we?

28:43.224 --> 28:45.663
The last person I saw

28:45.767 --> 28:50.238
didn't have but two teeth in
his mouth, so I guess West Virginia.

28:56.003 --> 28:58.845
- Oh, what in gay hell?
- What's the matter?

28:58.949 --> 29:01.931
- This could prove problematic.
- Why?

29:02.036 --> 29:05.811
The first name
on my driver's licence is Eugene.

29:05.916 --> 29:07.565
Eugene?

29:07.669 --> 29:10.011
Yes.
Eugene?

29:11.101 --> 29:12.761
Eugene?!

29:37.377 --> 29:42.390
- Can I see your licence?
- What seems to be the problem?

29:42.494 --> 29:44.976
You got a tail light out.
Your licence.

29:45.080 --> 29:49.065
Oh! A tail light out. That is
the very least of our problems.

29:49.169 --> 29:51.188
- What have we got here?
- Hola.

29:51.292 --> 29:52.483
Hi.

29:52.587 --> 29:55.735
Erm... I was wondering
if you could help us.

29:55.839 --> 29:58.533
We are three young
career girls from...

29:58.637 --> 30:01.743
- Career girls?
- Yes. From New York City.

30:01.848 --> 30:04.283
We are so lost you cannot believe.

30:04.388 --> 30:08.249
- Where do you think we are?
- West Virginia?

30:08.353 --> 30:10.290
West Virginia?

30:10.395 --> 30:13.545
You're a long way
from West Virginia, girls.

30:13.649 --> 30:18.083
Could you possibly help us find
a moderately priced hotel?

30:19.836 --> 30:22.762
We don't go for that
around these parts,

30:22.867 --> 30:25.894
white girls riding around
with niggers and spics.

30:25.998 --> 30:29.226
- Talk to him, you speak honky.
- Sheriff Dullard...

30:29.330 --> 30:31.769
- That's Dollard.
- I am sorry.

30:31.873 --> 30:35.862
- It's Dollard.
- It says Dullard on your name tag.

30:35.966 --> 30:38.605
It's a misprint!

30:40.899 --> 30:44.233
As I was saying,
we are three young career girls...

30:45.320 --> 30:49.318
- You're pretty.
- Why, thank you.

30:50.075 --> 30:52.501
Step out of the vehicle.

30:52.606 --> 30:55.465
- Don't do it.
- Vida, please be careful.

30:55.569 --> 30:57.615
Get out of the car.

30:59.835 --> 31:01.384
Christ, you're tall.

31:01.488 --> 31:05.411
- Is this really necessary?
- Where's your licence?

31:07.259 --> 31:09.832
Come with me to my car. Come on.

31:10.929 --> 31:12.838
You stay in the vehicle.

31:13.765 --> 31:19.277
Officer, if I could just explain.
My licence, the name...

31:19.381 --> 31:22.863
- Don't worry about your licence.
- Don't worry?

31:22.967 --> 31:25.895
I think maybe he's prejudiced.

31:27.571 --> 31:30.276
I bet you were the brightest
in your class.

31:32.659 --> 31:34.708
What are you doing?

31:34.812 --> 31:37.213
- Give me a kiss.
- No. Please, no.

31:37.317 --> 31:41.175
I know what you want. You know what
you career girls want?

31:41.279 --> 31:43.928
- Careers?
- Same thing as every girl wants.

31:44.032 --> 31:47.513
- No, please don't do this.
- Give Daddy some sugar.

31:47.617 --> 31:50.478
Please, no! Please. No.

31:50.582 --> 31:53.304
When a lady says no, she means...

31:54.139 --> 31:56.760
Get your hand off my dick, buddy!

32:01.104 --> 32:03.477
Sheriff Dullard?

32:04.566 --> 32:06.440
Sh-Sheriff Dullard?

32:10.822 --> 32:13.748
Noxee. Oh, no. Noxee!

32:13.853 --> 32:17.583
- Don't go out there.
- What is going on?

32:17.688 --> 32:20.966
I think he's dead.
Don't leave me.

32:21.070 --> 32:23.589
- I killed him.
- Why is he on the ground?

32:23.694 --> 32:25.762
- Are you sure?
- Don't go over!

32:25.867 --> 32:28.558
- How do you know he's dead?
- I'm not sure.

32:28.662 --> 32:33.018
- He had his hand up my dress...
- Feeling you up?

32:33.122 --> 32:35.633
He was trying to have
his way with me.

32:37.808 --> 32:42.238
- How do you know he's dead?
- If you want to know, you check.

32:42.342 --> 32:45.199
- Don't get an attitude.
- Let me check.

32:45.304 --> 32:48.450
I knew this accountant
who died on me like this.

32:48.554 --> 32:52.110
- Be careful, Chi Chi.
- I can't believe this.

32:54.324 --> 32:58.294
Mamis, don't quote me
but I think this one is deceased.

32:58.398 --> 33:03.255
Oh, my God. A dead white policeman?

33:03.359 --> 33:07.219
- Should we blow?
- Yes. Two words, b-low.

33:07.324 --> 33:11.053
- Let's go.
- Don't leave me with this dead man!

33:11.158 --> 33:15.352
Look, Miss Necrophilia,
get yourself in this car right now!

33:15.456 --> 33:19.315
I can't believe this.
I get a nice crown, a nice sceptre,

33:19.419 --> 33:22.641
then I end up being part of...

34:13.362 --> 34:15.734
What are we gonna do now?

34:30.712 --> 34:33.417
Lovely night. Look at those stars.

34:35.300 --> 34:36.895
Come on.

34:36.998 --> 34:39.505
Use your muscles.
Jealous?

34:46.018 --> 34:48.152
Oh, no, it isn't.

34:48.255 --> 34:51.572
Please...

34:51.676 --> 34:54.454
Now, we're stuck here forever.
I knew it.

34:54.558 --> 34:58.580
I could be in a comfortable,
climate-controlled environment

34:58.684 --> 35:01.205
on a transcontinental airline,

35:01.310 --> 35:05.587
enjoying my individual package
of peanuts and my warm towel

35:05.691 --> 35:07.713
if it wasn't for what? What?

35:07.817 --> 35:09.968
The little Hispanic rent-a-tart.

35:10.072 --> 35:14.345
I didn't ask to come on this trip,
did I? No, I don't think so.

35:14.450 --> 35:18.558
Did I ask you to be making me over
and jump all kinds of hoops?

35:18.662 --> 35:20.268
No, I don't think so.

35:20.372 --> 35:24.692
And do I want to go to jail
because of some cop-killer?

35:24.797 --> 35:27.487
The next town,
I'm jumping on the first man

35:27.591 --> 35:31.908
and I'm riding him all the way to
New York City and away from you two

35:32.012 --> 35:35.075
because this trip sucks, it sucks.

35:35.179 --> 35:39.537
After all we've done to include you,
you would leave us so quickly?

35:39.642 --> 35:41.164
Like that.

35:41.268 --> 35:43.501
All right.

35:43.605 --> 35:46.547
Since you have learned
absolutely nothing,

35:46.652 --> 35:50.406
I am hereby stripping you
of all your princess points.

35:51.293 --> 35:55.262
- Ooh, that's voodoo. That's cold.
- You can't do that.

35:55.367 --> 35:59.180
When I think Noxee and I decided
to take pity on this Latin boy in drag

35:59.284 --> 36:04.022
- and bring her along with us...
- "Noxee and l"? Uh, uh, uh.

36:04.127 --> 36:08.860
No, no! Noxee didn't decide anything.
Noxee got dragged into this.

36:08.965 --> 36:13.366
What about the two of you
leaving poor Miss Vida

36:13.470 --> 36:17.787
at the hands of this possibly dead
Sheriff Dullard

36:17.891 --> 36:22.440
and you stayed stuck
in this car like Mary Jo Kopechne?

36:25.285 --> 36:27.878
O dear and oft-thanked Wong Foo,

36:27.983 --> 36:32.090
it's not that I'm asking for help
but if something, anything...

36:32.194 --> 36:36.885
If somebody gave me back my
princess points, I would get us a ride.

36:36.990 --> 36:40.100
How can you hitchhike
if there are no cars, stupid?

36:40.204 --> 36:44.606
You don't know me very well.
I'm the Latina Marilyn Monroe.

36:44.710 --> 36:47.799
I got more legs
than a bucket of chicken.

36:50.435 --> 36:53.156
She'll get kidnapped
by some mountain man

36:53.260 --> 36:55.279
and we will have to rescue her.

36:55.383 --> 36:58.524
Why she always gotta have
the last word, huh?

37:19.089 --> 37:21.138
You need a ride?

37:21.242 --> 37:23.393
Yeah! Our car died over there

37:23.498 --> 37:27.355
and I just need to go
pick up my friends, all right?

37:27.459 --> 37:29.304
Hop in.

37:45.699 --> 37:49.834
Get inside.
I got us a ride to Spidersville.

37:49.939 --> 37:51.988
That's Snydersville.

37:53.165 --> 37:55.122
Thank you, Wong Foo.

38:00.339 --> 38:02.720
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:02.824 --> 38:04.875
Thank you.

38:53.517 --> 38:57.109
Well, ladies,
welcome to Snydersville.

38:57.213 --> 38:59.061
Thank you.

39:00.565 --> 39:04.694
- Virgil! Carol Ann!
- OK...

39:09.408 --> 39:11.667
Virgil?

39:11.771 --> 39:13.617
Carol Ann?

39:15.872 --> 39:19.076
And you thought
the Dust Bowl was over?

39:20.419 --> 39:25.496
- Bobby Ray, is that you?
- It sure is. Is Virgil in?

39:26.842 --> 39:31.438
- Virgil. It's Bobby Ray. You in?
- No.

39:31.542 --> 39:33.562
He's in.

39:33.666 --> 39:36.777
Tell him we got a big Cadillac
broke down upside the road.

39:36.881 --> 39:39.694
He's got a big Cadillac broke down.

39:39.798 --> 39:43.555
- So?
- He'll be right down.

39:53.368 --> 39:55.417
OK, well, this is it.

39:55.521 --> 39:58.966
Here you got your bathroom,
you got towels.

39:59.070 --> 40:02.466
If you want anything, holler.
We'll put your bags in the hall.

40:02.570 --> 40:05.092
You've got an overhead light here.

40:05.197 --> 40:08.173
- Go get it.
- That's not cool.

40:09.551 --> 40:12.727
You girls all did want to be
in the same room.

40:12.831 --> 40:17.431
Do you, by chance, have a room
that's possibly more inhabitable?

40:18.602 --> 40:20.818
This is the presidential suite.

40:20.922 --> 40:25.365
Must have been
one of those bad presidents.

40:25.469 --> 40:28.329
You seem a little tired
so I'll leave you be.

40:28.434 --> 40:31.873
Your car should be ready tomorrow.
It's only one night.

40:31.978 --> 40:36.961
- Excuse me.
- There's no toilet.

40:37.065 --> 40:38.880
You know what I think?

40:38.985 --> 40:42.630
The last black person
to stay here was Sam Cooke.

40:42.734 --> 40:44.925
"'The fates must despise me

40:45.029 --> 40:47.596
"'for I am doomed
to spend the rest of my days

40:47.701 --> 40:50.138
"'in this miserable cell.'

40:50.242 --> 40:52.311
"The rest of her days?

40:52.415 --> 40:56.521
"Suddenly, from out of the darkness
came evidence to the contrary.

40:56.625 --> 40:58.980
"'By the sword of my father
before me,

40:59.084 --> 41:02.733
"'I, Juan Carlos la Noche
will rescue Princess Laritza."'

41:02.838 --> 41:07.160
I think tomorrow
I'll wear a say-something hat.

41:07.264 --> 41:11.148
I think tomorrow
is a say-something hat day.

41:13.865 --> 41:17.585
"'I'm here to save you,
Princess Laritza.'

41:17.689 --> 41:21.196
"'You are my knight
in shining armour."'

41:55.240 --> 41:58.749
Why do I feel like I'm in
the Tournament Of Roses Parade?

41:58.853 --> 42:01.669
- Because you're as big as a float?
- Your mother.

42:01.774 --> 42:03.879
- Thank you.
- OK.

42:03.983 --> 42:08.509
As soon as I get to a town with a bus
I'm out of here. Howdy, y'all.

42:08.613 --> 42:10.829
Hello.

42:12.716 --> 42:15.852
For girls,
they're sure strong and big.

42:15.957 --> 42:19.020
- Brunell?
- Virgil.

42:19.124 --> 42:23.528
Oh, Virgil.
So how long will she take to fix?

42:23.632 --> 42:27.360
- All of five minutes.
- Oh, my goodness. Thank you.

42:27.464 --> 42:29.655
When I get the part.

42:29.759 --> 42:35.161
See, I don't have any Cadillac parts,
especially no old ones.

42:35.266 --> 42:40.124
- I can order it for Monday.
- It's Saturday morning now.

42:40.228 --> 42:43.505
- What do we do till Monday?
- You got to wait.

42:43.609 --> 42:46.914
Oh, no, no, no, no!
People are waiting for me.

42:50.045 --> 42:54.588
Ladies. Ladies.
You're just gonna have to wait.

42:55.676 --> 42:59.091
- Maybe Virgil can call his friend...
- Carol Ann.

43:01.890 --> 43:04.067
Excuse me.

43:04.172 --> 43:07.068
What are we gonna do now,
Miss Know-It-All?

43:07.172 --> 43:09.111
- Hello.
- What are we gonna do?

43:09.215 --> 43:11.321
We will have to stay here till Monday

43:11.426 --> 43:15.812
and get to know this lovely town
and its inhabit... ants.

43:16.571 --> 43:19.691
Excuse me. What are you gawking at?

43:21.159 --> 43:24.252
What are you gonna do about it?

43:24.356 --> 43:26.506
Nothing.

43:26.611 --> 43:30.717
I love roughnecks. If I was your bread,
would you be my butter?

43:30.821 --> 43:33.342
My God.
This is my idea of hell!

43:33.447 --> 43:36.930
- Careful.
- Who is their art director? Ma Joad?

43:37.035 --> 43:40.267
We will make the most of it. Watch.

43:40.371 --> 43:43.899
Pardon me, kind sirs. Pardon me.

43:44.003 --> 43:46.317
Thank you.

43:46.421 --> 43:49.113
My name is Vida Boheme
of the Manhattan Bohemes

43:49.218 --> 43:53.029
and my travelling companions and I

43:53.133 --> 43:56.201
will be staying in your fair hamlet
for the weekend.

43:56.305 --> 44:01.070
Are there some historical points of
interest that we should not miss?

44:03.619 --> 44:08.695
She can't hear and she don't talk.
She's just a little...

44:09.916 --> 44:11.678
Oh. Oh...

44:11.782 --> 44:16.886
There's nothing interesting here
for you, you're from New York City.

44:16.990 --> 44:19.883
But we'll try to be accommodating.

44:22.095 --> 44:24.847
Well, er, thank you.

44:27.059 --> 44:28.525
Pardon me.

44:28.629 --> 44:34.114
But let's just all suck it up
and make this place tolerable, OK?

44:34.218 --> 44:38.105
Now, ready?
Operation Decorator Storm.

44:42.407 --> 44:46.357
~ Wonder Woman Wonder Woman ~

44:47.162 --> 44:51.214
~ All the world is waiting for you ~

44:51.318 --> 44:54.095
~ And the power you possess ~

44:54.199 --> 44:59.265
~ In your satin tights
Fighting for your rights ~

44:59.369 --> 45:03.670
~ And the old red, white and blue ~

45:05.347 --> 45:07.221
~ Wonder Woman ~

45:09.476 --> 45:11.267
~ Wonder Woman ~

45:13.021 --> 45:14.895
~ Wonder Woman ~

45:16.984 --> 45:19.826
~ Wonder Woman ~

45:19.930 --> 45:23.023
~ You're a wonder,
Wonder Woman ~

45:32.457 --> 45:34.415
- That's him.
- Jeez!

45:39.381 --> 45:42.268
- This guy's living.
- You think?

45:42.372 --> 45:46.017
- Sheriff Dullard?
- Dollard here.

45:46.121 --> 45:48.855
- Your badge says Dullard.
- It's a misprint.

45:48.959 --> 45:53.226
- Sheriff, what happened here?
- I was attacked.

45:56.398 --> 45:59.157
- Hello, Loretta.
- Hello.

45:59.261 --> 46:04.829
Alcoholic. Low self-esteem.
Her daddy used to call her Baby Ugly.

46:04.934 --> 46:07.991
She took to the bottle
as soon as she could swallow.

46:08.994 --> 46:13.507
Over there. Her and her husband
ain't had sex for nearly seven years.

46:13.611 --> 46:18.678
Another mess is the youngest
of the Budd family over there.

46:18.782 --> 46:22.390
Poor thing, he's got a sad little...
st-st-st-stutter.

46:22.494 --> 46:26.140
It'd bring a tear to your eye.
Then there's Clara.

46:26.244 --> 46:29.478
You can say anything to her.
She don't hear, she can't talk.

46:29.582 --> 46:31.400
- She can't hear you?
- No.

46:31.504 --> 46:34.023
Your stockings are falling down!

46:34.127 --> 46:39.659
There's no medical reason. Ever since
her husband lost the movie theatre

46:39.763 --> 46:44.368
and he run off with that lady film -
what do you call it? - Distributor.

46:44.472 --> 46:49.322
Oh! Now, over there is Jimmy Joe,
who runs the Rooster and Pony.

46:50.577 --> 46:53.697
He is the nicest coloured man
you'd ever want to meet.

46:55.666 --> 46:57.907
Robert Mitchum?

46:59.628 --> 47:03.137
Yoo-hoo!
Excuse me, you forgot something!

47:03.241 --> 47:05.763
Hello! Excuse me!

47:05.867 --> 47:08.142
You forgot your picture!

47:08.246 --> 47:12.145
I picked it up because
I didn't want it to get dragged...

47:12.249 --> 47:15.842
Oh, no, girlfriend...
Did you just do a U-ie?

47:16.979 --> 47:22.535
Oh, girl. I'm coming.
I'm a-coming! I'm gonna get you.

47:22.639 --> 47:24.409
I'm just trying to give you back...

47:24.513 --> 47:26.368
Ooh! Ow!

47:26.472 --> 47:28.495
I don't find this funny any more.

47:28.600 --> 47:31.710
Sheriff Dollard,
we've read your filed report

47:31.814 --> 47:34.627
regarding the assault
in your jurisdiction

47:34.732 --> 47:38.840
and we should ask a few questions
before we pursue this case.

47:38.944 --> 47:42.137
First off,
with regards to the assailant,

47:42.241 --> 47:47.640
are we correct in summarising, if
we can clarify matters by saying that...

47:47.745 --> 47:50.125
you got beat up by a girl?

47:55.559 --> 47:57.691
They were not girls.

47:57.795 --> 48:02.312
They were boys, three of them,
and one of them was black.

48:03.483 --> 48:07.747
- May we see Exhibit A?
- Found at the scene of the crime.

48:07.851 --> 48:09.249
All right!

48:09.353 --> 48:12.822
They were dressed up like girls
but they were boys.

48:13.910 --> 48:17.668
You sons of bitches.
Don't laugh at me!

48:17.773 --> 48:22.050
I was attacked by perverts!
If you won't do something, I will!

48:22.154 --> 48:26.557
- Mrs Dollard...
- Give me the shoe.

48:26.662 --> 48:29.973
- Mrs Dollard.
- Shut up. Just shut up!

48:30.078 --> 48:32.728
I'm gonna bring back three corpses.

48:32.833 --> 48:35.231
And when you look up their dresses

48:35.335 --> 48:38.649
if you don't find something
you shouldn't find,

48:38.753 --> 48:41.396
I don't know what.

49:05.545 --> 49:07.594
I was a Fresh-Air Fund kid.

49:07.699 --> 49:12.216
They used to take us troubled kids
into the country for picnics...

49:16.807 --> 49:19.761
I didn't know
it was gonna be a party.

49:22.646 --> 49:26.726
I would have dressed for it.
Liquorice, anyone?

49:33.323 --> 49:37.958
I guess it's a poker party, you got
all your players, you don't need me.

49:38.062 --> 49:40.362
Looksies, no feelsies.

49:45.502 --> 49:48.871
Anybody read any good books lately?

49:55.929 --> 49:59.013
Come on!

50:03.604 --> 50:06.273
That's how you pick up a lady.

50:12.321 --> 50:14.914
Carol Ann, darling,
we need more towels.

50:15.018 --> 50:19.459
We've gone through the first 14
but, you know, girl stuff.

50:19.563 --> 50:23.671
- Are you crying?
- No. Just chopping onions.

50:23.776 --> 50:27.762
TVW - the very worst.
Quick household hint, if I may.

50:27.866 --> 50:30.678
Put these on
and it will shield your eyes...

50:30.783 --> 50:34.392
- No, don't.
- Oh, darling, what happened?

50:34.496 --> 50:35.685
Nothing.

50:35.789 --> 50:39.519
You are going to have a shiner,
put a steak on that.

50:39.623 --> 50:42.734
These boxes
dropped on me from that closet.

50:42.839 --> 50:45.810
Anyway,
I got to get this dinner ready.

50:49.107 --> 50:51.701
- Oh, oh! May I?
- What's that?

50:51.805 --> 50:54.370
Just a little spice.

50:54.474 --> 50:57.897
- A little paprika...
- No, don't! No, don't!

50:58.992 --> 51:01.835
- We don't use spices here.
- I am sorry.

51:01.939 --> 51:05.170
- Virgil does not like it.
- I'm just pushy.

51:05.275 --> 51:08.831
Virgil does like his way,
doesn't he?

51:10.587 --> 51:13.346
You're very observant.

51:13.450 --> 51:16.560
As a matter of fact...

51:16.664 --> 51:20.144
I can't help but observe right now

51:20.248 --> 51:24.006
that there are
no chopped onions anywhere.

51:26.520 --> 51:30.849
I think that maybe you'd better
just let me finish this alone.

51:31.942 --> 51:34.397
Surely.

51:38.657 --> 51:42.626
And the box in the closet?
Good one, darling.

51:42.731 --> 51:46.883
I used to tell people that when
my father called me cruel names,

51:46.987 --> 51:50.077
it was just because
of his sense of humour.

51:52.421 --> 51:54.470
If you need more towels,

51:54.574 --> 51:58.711
you'll find them in the closet
down at the end of the hallway.

52:11.898 --> 52:13.864
Hello.

52:13.968 --> 52:15.991
I brought your picture back.

52:16.095 --> 52:18.285
You dropped it earlier and...

52:18.389 --> 52:20.854
Thank you. You're welcome.

52:25.329 --> 52:28.828
Wow. Miss Thing got
some stuff in here.

52:31.043 --> 52:33.249
Mind if I sit?

52:35.005 --> 52:37.892
Whoo!

52:37.996 --> 52:42.011
That little run you took me on
really took a lot out of me.

52:43.096 --> 52:46.382
Not that I'm not in shape
or anything, but...

52:54.858 --> 52:57.829
Those boys didn't hurt you,
did they, Miss Chi Chi?

52:57.933 --> 53:00.246
Just a little bit, Bobby.

53:00.350 --> 53:03.157
Nothing time won't heal. Thank you.

53:04.159 --> 53:08.211
Look at your eyes. They as blue
as window cleaner, Bobby Lee.

53:08.315 --> 53:11.175
That's Bobby Ray.
Bobby Lee's a girl.

53:11.280 --> 53:14.092
I'm sorry. Is that your girlfriend?

53:14.196 --> 53:18.349
No, I don't got one of those.
A girlfriend, I mean. I got a name -

53:18.454 --> 53:20.712
Bobby Ray but you know that.

53:25.347 --> 53:29.843
Sorry. They have a mind of their own,
you know. My goodness.

53:30.936 --> 53:34.610
My God, that was so brave
what you did back over there.

53:34.715 --> 53:35.906
Aw...

53:36.011 --> 53:39.907
You were just like a regular
knight in shining pick-up truck.

53:40.012 --> 53:43.706
- Stop it.
- What time are you due...

53:43.810 --> 53:46.273
Bobby! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

53:53.041 --> 53:55.330
That's so romantical.

53:57.421 --> 54:00.955
God. I don't have the words.

54:03.510 --> 54:07.607
Don't cry, Miss Chi Chi.
Please don't cry.

54:07.711 --> 54:13.321
Miss Chi Chi, if you were my girl,
you'd never cry for anything,

54:13.425 --> 54:16.064
except maybe from happiness.

54:22.029 --> 54:24.317
You said a mouthful.

54:34.374 --> 54:36.581
- Let's go.
- All right.

54:50.557 --> 54:54.389
Don't think that I can't see you,
Miss Bobby Lee. Come, come.

54:56.104 --> 54:59.991
So, you are Virgil and Carol Ann's
eldest, am I right?

55:00.095 --> 55:02.660
Yeah. How did you know?

55:02.764 --> 55:05.456
I'm the eldest in my family, too.

55:05.561 --> 55:07.163
Wow.

55:07.268 --> 55:09.613
I picked these for your mom.

55:10.827 --> 55:14.420
They only grow in darkness and dank

55:14.524 --> 55:16.823
but sweetness, how they blossom.

55:17.709 --> 55:20.710
- You know a lot.
- Oh, please.

55:22.172 --> 55:25.392
I guess it's on account
of what you really are.

55:25.496 --> 55:28.551
Bobby Ray told me
what you really are.

55:29.638 --> 55:31.897
- He did?
- Yeah.

55:32.002 --> 55:34.612
You're a career girl.

55:34.716 --> 55:37.904
Oh! Yes. Yes.

55:38.009 --> 55:40.195
I could never be like that.

55:40.300 --> 55:43.450
Oh, no. You can be anything you want.

55:43.554 --> 55:46.536
You just imagine
good things happening

55:46.640 --> 55:49.622
- and you make them happen.
- Oh.

55:49.727 --> 55:55.378
Well, what if what I want to imagine
is a boy I want to go out with?

55:55.482 --> 55:59.091
You might want to set your sights
a tiny bit higher.

55:59.196 --> 56:03.598
Just to start off. Then I'll work
on the career-girl stuff.

56:03.702 --> 56:06.930
Miss Vida thinks
that I don't have a dream.

56:07.035 --> 56:10.811
I'm not Martin Luther King.
I don't need a dream. I have a plan.

56:10.916 --> 56:15.983
I'm gonna tell you what it is
because I knew I could trust you,

56:16.087 --> 56:18.818
being as you're not a big talker
and everything.

56:18.923 --> 56:21.821
My plan is that, while in Hollywood,

56:21.926 --> 56:26.411
I will be approached by an eminent
producer - at the Ivy, no doubt -

56:26.516 --> 56:29.412
to star in the lush film version

56:29.516 --> 56:33.357
of the life
of Miss Dorothy Dandridge.

56:34.661 --> 56:39.296
Oh, yes. That noble blacktress
who never played domestic help

56:39.400 --> 56:43.426
and whose career was crushed
by the white Hollywood machine.

56:43.531 --> 56:45.803
Homegirl ended up dying penniless.

56:45.907 --> 56:49.139
I can remember
almost everything she's ever done,

56:49.244 --> 56:53.314
from Serenade Sun Valley
to Bahama Passage.

56:53.419 --> 56:54.983
Gorgeous performance.

56:55.087 --> 56:59.153
After that was Hit Parade Of '43,
Drums Of The Congo.

56:59.258 --> 57:02.820
No, no, no - Drums Of The Congo,
then Hit Parade Of '43.

57:02.924 --> 57:04.825
Then between that and Carmen Jones

57:04.929 --> 57:07.448
she did something... Road.
Road... road.

57:07.552 --> 57:09.410
- Bright Road.
- Thank you.

57:09.514 --> 57:11.998
Carmen Jones
and then Island In The Sun

57:12.102 --> 57:15.666
and her co-star in Carmen Jones
was Miss Pearl Bailey,

57:15.770 --> 57:19.824
whose birthday I think should be
a national holiday.

57:22.918 --> 57:25.409
Did you say something?

57:27.923 --> 57:30.932
Carmen Jones,
then Island In The Sun,

57:31.036 --> 57:35.856
then Decks Ran Red,
then, oh, yes, Porgy And Bess.

57:35.960 --> 57:40.150
Oh, spectacular.
Then there was... er... er...

57:40.254 --> 57:43.512
- Tamango.
- Tamango...

57:45.524 --> 57:47.184
Malaga.

57:48.193 --> 57:50.536
Malaga.

57:50.640 --> 57:52.955
Honey, when did you
start talking?

57:53.059 --> 57:56.540
Wanna try Lena Horne?

57:56.644 --> 57:58.379
Go, girl.

57:58.484 --> 58:01.341
Feature debut, 1942.

58:01.445 --> 58:03.538
Panama Hattie!

58:05.294 --> 58:08.552
That's wonderful.
That is just wonderful.

58:08.656 --> 58:11.684
You're not gonna start
walking across water

58:11.789 --> 58:14.296
and making the blind see, are you?

58:24.146 --> 58:27.116
You put spices in here.

58:27.221 --> 58:29.479
Some fell in. I scooped them out.

58:32.571 --> 58:37.500
You do this to make me mad.
Why do you want to make me mad?

58:37.604 --> 58:40.380
- I scooped them out.
- Why are you arguing with me?

58:40.484 --> 58:43.455
- I'm not.
- You want me to hit you?

58:51.757 --> 58:53.833
Take them out.

59:07.940 --> 59:09.406
- Jimmy Jay?
- Joe.

59:09.510 --> 59:11.199
- Joe Jay.
- Jimmy Joe.

59:11.303 --> 59:13.825
Can we have one ladies' cocktail...

59:13.929 --> 59:15.620
- Miss Clara!
- I know her.

59:15.724 --> 59:19.167
- Hey, girl.
- Hi, sweetie. Sit here.

59:19.272 --> 59:22.001
- Hi. I'm Noxeema.
- How do you do?

59:22.106 --> 59:24.921
- Noxeema Jackson.
- Noxeema?

59:25.025 --> 59:27.969
Uh-huh. Jesse's daughter.

59:28.073 --> 59:30.802
So, Beatrice,
what are we working on?

59:30.906 --> 59:34.055
We are working on decorations
for the Strawberry Social.

59:34.159 --> 59:36.975
- Strawberry Social?
- The biggest thing in these parts.

59:37.079 --> 59:40.606
We're doing it tomorrow.
We all make strawberry pies,

59:40.710 --> 59:45.010
we take them into the centre of town,
then we eat the strawberry pies.

59:46.144 --> 59:48.470
Then we go home.

59:50.023 --> 59:53.199
Oh, lovely! Une fÃªte champÃªtre.

59:53.304 --> 59:55.325
- May I?
- Oh, please.

59:55.430 --> 59:58.291
Is there music and dancing and?

59:58.395 --> 01:00:03.250
We used to have a hollering contest
but some people didn't like it.

01:00:03.354 --> 01:00:07.086
We give out ribbons
for the best strawberry pie.

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:09.508
- This party craves a theme.
- Theme?

01:00:09.613 --> 01:00:12.918
What do strawberries say
to anyone here?

01:00:13.714 --> 01:00:16.473
Well, erm...

01:00:16.577 --> 01:00:19.559
Strawberries are red.

01:00:19.663 --> 01:00:22.395
Good. That's a start.

01:00:22.499 --> 01:00:26.055
- Wild strawberries.
- Yes, wonderful!

01:00:26.935 --> 01:00:30.111
- Red and wild. That's your theme.
- What?

01:00:30.216 --> 01:00:36.116
Red and wild is our theme.
You know what we should have today?

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.830
- A day with the girls.
- A day with the girls.

01:00:39.935 --> 01:00:44.792
Somebody has to drive me
to Greenville. Come on.

01:00:44.896 --> 01:00:50.260
A day with the girls,
like in New York high society!

01:00:50.364 --> 01:00:52.382
Merna, what's a day
with the girls?

01:00:52.487 --> 01:00:56.053
Katina,
first you do volunteer work

01:00:56.157 --> 01:00:58.557
and then you get your hair done,

01:00:58.662 --> 01:01:00.560
then you pick out a new outfit

01:01:00.665 --> 01:01:03.274
and then you go sit
in a cafÃ© and talk.

01:01:03.378 --> 01:01:06.401
I've never heard
that expression before.

01:01:06.505 --> 01:01:09.317
I'm Merna. I run the beauty parlour.

01:01:09.421 --> 01:01:11.850
Beauty parlour?

01:01:15.984 --> 01:01:18.060
Here, here it is!

01:01:19.905 --> 01:01:21.364
Oh!

01:02:30.225 --> 01:02:33.112
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:35.486
Man! Look at that!

01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:39.450
It's like living
in a Tex Avery cartoon.

01:02:39.554 --> 01:02:41.952
I think we should
just ignore them.

01:02:42.057 --> 01:02:45.248
Oh, no, no, no.
Noxee, please, no.

01:02:45.353 --> 01:02:47.565
What's all this noise?

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:52.463
Oh, baby.
You are a whole lot of woman.

01:02:52.567 --> 01:02:54.588
I know what you need.

01:02:54.692 --> 01:02:57.553
I hardly think you're the man
to give it to me.

01:02:57.658 --> 01:03:01.162
- Oh, no?
- Tough talk.

01:03:05.177 --> 01:03:07.725
Thank you.

01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:11.054
I think you should apologise to me.

01:03:12.935 --> 01:03:16.488
And I also think you should
apologise to those ladies.

01:03:16.592 --> 01:03:20.117
I ain't apologising to no ladies.
No way.

01:03:20.221 --> 01:03:21.786
No way.

01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:26.072
Just as I expected.
Well... do you like my nails?

01:03:31.078 --> 01:03:32.951
Walk.

01:03:34.247 --> 01:03:37.414
What can I say?
She's had a difficult life.

01:03:38.418 --> 01:03:42.054
What did you say your name was?
Your name?

01:03:42.159 --> 01:03:44.346
- Tommy.
- Tommy, Tommy.

01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:48.227
Well, Tommy, this is Miss Vida
and Miss Clara

01:03:48.331 --> 01:03:51.357
and this is Miss Katina
and Miss Merna,

01:03:51.462 --> 01:03:55.445
Miss Loretta and of course
Miss Little Bobby Lee.

01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:59.027
Now, Tommy, when you encounter
such gorgeous ladies,

01:03:59.132 --> 01:04:02.531
the correct way to greet them
is to say,

01:04:02.635 --> 01:04:06.689
"Good afternoon, ladies."
Can you say that, Tommy?

01:04:08.448 --> 01:04:10.126
Good afternoon, ladies.

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:13.709
Unless it's the evening
and then you say what?

01:04:13.813 --> 01:04:15.881
Good evening, ladies.

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:18.927
Go home, take a bath, comb your hair

01:04:19.031 --> 01:04:22.426
and please put on a clean shirt
when you step outside.

01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:25.920
It's an affront
to the very delicacy of my nature.

01:04:29.636 --> 01:04:31.712
Miss Clara.

01:04:37.686 --> 01:04:41.278
You just got to know
how to talk to people.

01:04:41.382 --> 01:04:44.576
And a four and a five

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.700
and a six

01:04:46.804 --> 01:04:50.204
and a seven and a eight.

01:04:50.308 --> 01:04:52.209
Children, and one.

01:04:52.313 --> 01:04:54.333
PliÃ© on two.

01:04:54.437 --> 01:04:57.412
And three, opening four.

01:04:58.665 --> 01:05:01.156
Come, come, come.

01:05:02.669 --> 01:05:04.958
Hello, you handsome thing.

01:05:06.298 --> 01:05:10.684
- All right. No colours.
- No. No. No. No.

01:05:10.788 --> 01:05:14.889
We just have-have
w-what's on the f-floor.

01:05:16.308 --> 01:05:21.986
- We're not gonna have much luck.
- It is looking somewhat serious.

01:05:22.091 --> 01:05:24.657
What?

01:05:24.761 --> 01:05:28.369
- Oh, my God!
- What? Speak to me.

01:05:28.473 --> 01:05:30.983
Oh! Oh...

01:05:32.616 --> 01:05:36.234
Oh! Oh! I can't believe it! Oh!

01:05:37.496 --> 01:05:40.829
Look! They're from the Sixties!

01:05:41.541 --> 01:05:46.554
There's a whole bunch of it,
there's something for everybody.

01:05:46.658 --> 01:05:50.471
T-That's just s-stuff my grandma bought
w-when she opened.

01:05:50.575 --> 01:05:55.397
It never s-s-s-sold
and she never s-s-s-sent it b-b-back

01:05:55.501 --> 01:05:58.942
and we were gonna g-give it
to Good-Good-Good...

01:05:59.046 --> 01:06:00.650
Good-Good-Good...

01:06:00.754 --> 01:06:04.447
- Can you believe? I can't believe!
- Good-Good-Good...

01:06:04.551 --> 01:06:07.865
Look at this. Look, look.

01:06:07.969 --> 01:06:10.830
Oh, Miss Clara,
you're gonna look like Emma Peel.

01:06:10.934 --> 01:06:13.369
Ooh! Sorry.

01:06:13.473 --> 01:06:15.821
Goodwill.

01:06:17.744 --> 01:06:22.175
- Yes. For me.
- No, no, no. No, this is mine.

01:06:22.279 --> 01:06:26.301
Oh, there's this fringe, honey.
I think I'm gonna black out.

01:06:26.405 --> 01:06:29.387
~ Another time Another place ~

01:06:29.491 --> 01:06:32.935
~ A little Maybelline
to spread on my face, well ~

01:06:33.039 --> 01:06:36.934
~ Lace underwear
A tube of Nair ~

01:06:37.039 --> 01:06:40.233
~ Make up my eyes
and I tease out my hair, yeah... ~

01:06:40.338 --> 01:06:42.902
~ Polish my pumps... ~
- Good afternoon.

01:06:43.006 --> 01:06:44.572
~ And I pull on some hose ~

01:06:44.676 --> 01:06:47.988
~ Break out my clothes,
yeah, I need to unload ~

01:06:48.092 --> 01:06:51.824
~ It makes me feel so mighty real ~

01:06:51.928 --> 01:06:55.873
~ Run in my stockings
hey, it ain't no big deal ~

01:06:55.977 --> 01:07:00.545
~ Turn it out
You've got to turn it out... ~

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:03.546
This book has been
sort of a Bible for me

01:07:03.651 --> 01:07:05.700
and, well... here.

01:07:07.794 --> 01:07:09.472
"DV."

01:07:09.576 --> 01:07:15.353
"The Au-au-autobiography
Of Diana "V-Vreeland."

01:07:15.457 --> 01:07:18.511
And l-l-l-I should read this?

01:07:19.556 --> 01:07:23.110
Oh, hon, you should commit
sections to memory.

01:07:23.214 --> 01:07:26.277
Check yourself, Loretta,
before you wreck yourself.

01:07:26.382 --> 01:07:29.491
~ Shine up the runway
while I powder my nose ~

01:07:29.595 --> 01:07:32.453
~ Turn on the spotlight
Gonna strike up a pose ~

01:07:32.558 --> 01:07:36.663
~ Well, for savoir faire,
more derriÃ¨re... ~

01:07:36.767 --> 01:07:39.278
Oh!

01:07:40.744 --> 01:07:43.837
~ Turn it out
You've got to turn it out ~

01:07:43.941 --> 01:07:48.540
~ Looking like a luminary,
extraordinary, sing it... ~

01:07:52.422 --> 01:07:56.372
Acting real proud of yourself
like a New York City girl, huh?

01:08:01.431 --> 01:08:05.023
- God! It's still too spicy.
- I scooped them out...

01:08:05.128 --> 01:08:08.860
Don't argue with me because
if you argue, you're gonna lose.

01:08:08.964 --> 01:08:11.311
- It's too goddamn hot!
- No!

01:08:13.986 --> 01:08:17.411
Eartha...
Miss Kitt to you.

01:08:17.515 --> 01:08:21.541
Dinah Washington
sitting on this shelf getting dusty!

01:08:21.645 --> 01:08:25.948
Honey, we should play these.
The air should be filled with music.

01:08:33.546 --> 01:08:35.180
~ Je cherche un homme... ~

01:08:35.283 --> 01:08:37.434
- Here, put this on.
- Oh, no.

01:08:37.537 --> 01:08:40.435
- Why?
- No, I can't do that. It's too big.

01:08:40.538 --> 01:08:43.189
It can never be too big.
Here, put this on.

01:08:43.292 --> 01:08:45.314
Come on. Dance with me.

01:08:45.417 --> 01:08:49.404
~ Peu m'importe comment il se nomme ~

01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:53.892
~ S'il est un homme, un homme,
un homme... ~

01:08:55.986 --> 01:08:59.411
"That season,
we were loaded with pizzazz,"

01:08:59.515 --> 01:09:01.862
"earrings of fuchsia and peach."

01:09:02.908 --> 01:09:06.462
"Mind you, peach."

01:09:06.567 --> 01:09:09.381
"And hats. Hats, hats, hats."

01:09:09.484 --> 01:09:12.328
"Hats for career girls."

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.930
"How I adored Paris."

01:09:16.035 --> 01:09:19.348
Jimmy Joe, this is not
just a restaurant any more.

01:09:19.452 --> 01:09:21.881
You have turned it
into a lovely cafÃ©.

01:09:22.929 --> 01:09:24.812
A cafÃ©?

01:09:24.916 --> 01:09:28.987
Now slap a dollar surcharge
on every bill out here. Paid for.

01:09:29.091 --> 01:09:31.986
Thank you, my little Miss Vida.

01:09:32.091 --> 01:09:35.240
I've got a secret romance.
Couldn't you just lose it?

01:09:35.344 --> 01:09:39.497
- To say the least.
- I got a secret romance, too.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.497
Oh, shut up. For real?

01:09:41.602 --> 01:09:44.876
And this secret romance
is very handsome, I hear.

01:09:44.981 --> 01:09:46.085
Miss Vida!

01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:50.212
Mine, too. What a coinky-dinky.
And he's so sweet.

01:09:50.317 --> 01:09:53.715
Mine, too.
And, oh, he's so strong.

01:09:53.819 --> 01:09:57.513
Let me tell you,
my papi is built like a brick...

01:09:57.617 --> 01:10:00.809
- Let's go.
- Ow! What's the matter with you?

01:10:00.913 --> 01:10:05.961
Bobby Lee, listen. The way
to make things happen is imagine.

01:10:08.767 --> 01:10:10.641
Imagine.

01:10:17.276 --> 01:10:22.704
~ He doesn't have to be
handsome as a picture ~

01:10:22.808 --> 01:10:27.277
~ An ordinary guy's
all right with me... ~

01:10:34.626 --> 01:10:37.552
Oh, Carol Ann, what on earth?

01:10:37.656 --> 01:10:40.085
I'm just so clumsy. I mean...

01:10:41.174 --> 01:10:43.978
Virgil yelled at me.
I mean, he called out to me.

01:10:44.083 --> 01:10:47.504
And, well, I just spilled the stew.

01:10:47.973 --> 01:10:52.350
Hon, do you, like,
ever not cry in this room?

01:11:03.905 --> 01:11:07.125
Oooh! Guess what I see.

01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:10.043
- I spy with my little eye.
- What is this?

01:11:10.147 --> 01:11:12.611
Somebody's coming courting.

01:11:13.665 --> 01:11:16.674
Miss Vida, I just kept thinking
it was happening.

01:11:16.779 --> 01:11:18.717
I imagined just like you said.

01:11:18.821 --> 01:11:21.721
Is that who you have
your little brown roots set on?

01:11:21.825 --> 01:11:23.976
- Yeah.
- Shush.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.127
No, mamita, please!

01:11:29.222 --> 01:11:32.971
- Evening, ladies.
- Good evening, Bobby Ray.

01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:36.698
I come to ask somebody out
to the sociable.

01:11:36.802 --> 01:11:39.742
- Well, I declare.
- I declare.

01:11:39.847 --> 01:11:42.568
- I declare.
- I decline.

01:11:43.779 --> 01:11:48.156
Well, er, it's tomorrow afternoon,
so I best be asking.

01:11:51.745 --> 01:11:55.670
- Bobby Lee?
- Yes, Bobby Ray?

01:11:55.774 --> 01:11:59.423
Could you do me a favour
and take the little ones inside?

01:11:59.528 --> 01:12:02.836
I need to talk to
Miss Chi Chi Rodriguez in private.

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:10.353
Bobby Lee, mamita,
don't be so sensitive.

01:12:10.457 --> 01:12:13.567
- Bobby Lee!
- She's so sensitive.

01:12:13.671 --> 01:12:17.307
Bobby Lee.
I didn't know it'd happen.

01:12:18.438 --> 01:12:22.452
- Er, Miss Chi Chi...
- Won't you come back in an hour?

01:12:22.556 --> 01:12:27.188
- Er...
- Shh. Just say yes. OK. I'll see you.

01:12:33.578 --> 01:12:37.171
It's absolutely
out of the question.

01:12:37.275 --> 01:12:40.175
You're not my mamas
and you can't stop me.

01:12:40.279 --> 01:12:44.349
Darling, you most certainly will not
be going out with Mr Bobby Ray.

01:12:44.453 --> 01:12:46.638
Why not? We got a lot in common.

01:12:46.743 --> 01:12:49.937
For starters, the same business
in between your legs.

01:12:50.041 --> 01:12:51.855
Poinky-poinky-poink-poink!

01:12:51.959 --> 01:12:54.440
If he gets a whiff
of your wiles, darling...

01:12:54.544 --> 01:12:57.775
It's the "why I'm always right
and you're wrong" song

01:12:57.879 --> 01:13:00.573
sung by
her lonely breasteses herself.

01:13:00.677 --> 01:13:03.656
What do you know about relationships?

01:13:03.761 --> 01:13:06.659
- I mean, who loves you, baby?
- Be quiet, Chi Chi.

01:13:06.764 --> 01:13:11.666
Nobody, that's who.
Not even your rich mommy and daddy.

01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:15.583
Oh, oh! I know what this is about.
This is about jealousy

01:13:15.687 --> 01:13:20.048
because I'm going out with a cute boy
and you ain't. Hello, goodbye.

01:13:20.152 --> 01:13:24.427
You are deceiving that child. That boy
does not know which end is up

01:13:24.532 --> 01:13:28.097
and you know that Miss Bobby Lee
is in love with him.

01:13:28.201 --> 01:13:30.102
So what if she is?

01:13:30.206 --> 01:13:33.769
Maybe I want something?
What's wrong with that?

01:13:33.873 --> 01:13:36.024
Miss Girl
is dealing with some demons.

01:13:36.129 --> 01:13:41.068
- I will not allow you to play games.
- Allow? Allow!

01:13:41.172 --> 01:13:44.865
There are human rules
by which we operate, sweetheart.

01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:47.829
I'm so sick of
this freakazoid white lady

01:13:47.933 --> 01:13:53.415
telling a black lady and a Latin lady
which way is up, down and under.

01:13:53.519 --> 01:13:57.839
You can laugh but I hope you pack
that Cadillac because I'm staying.

01:13:57.943 --> 01:14:02.426
You're staying? Well, Miss Jennifer
Holliday, go ahead and stay.

01:14:02.530 --> 01:14:04.095
Don't forget to write.

01:14:04.199 --> 01:14:06.807
She truly does have
a piÃ±ata for a head.

01:14:06.911 --> 01:14:08.724
Don't go there, Vida.

01:14:08.828 --> 01:14:11.519
She's an oppressive gringa
with a pinga.

01:14:11.623 --> 01:14:14.436
- All right, y'all.
- You are a puta Spanish fly.

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:18.149
- Don't go there.
- You are an uptight, cellulite,

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:20.025
fossil-face, cracker witch.

01:14:20.129 --> 01:14:23.527
Listen to me, you little
sway-backed, Third World...

01:14:23.631 --> 01:14:26.742
- She went there.
Selfish piece of street trash!

01:14:26.846 --> 01:14:28.866
You're the selfish one,

01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:32.618
bossing people's lives around
without them even asking you,

01:14:32.723 --> 01:14:34.737
Mrs Ann Landers pain in my culo.

01:14:35.325 --> 01:14:37.752
How dare you think that...

01:14:37.856 --> 01:14:39.671
What is that noise?

01:14:39.776 --> 01:14:44.759
You want to know? That's you
running into everybody's house...

01:14:44.863 --> 01:14:46.800
Shut up, Chi Chi!

01:14:46.905 --> 01:14:50.304
When I look at you,
it makes me want to throw up.

01:14:50.408 --> 01:14:54.601
- Virgil's beating up Carol Ann.
- Most likely.

01:14:54.705 --> 01:14:56.977
Well, we have to help her.

01:14:57.081 --> 01:15:00.192
No, no. Vida,
there are times when you help people

01:15:00.296 --> 01:15:03.321
and then there are times
when if you help people,

01:15:03.425 --> 01:15:07.864
you ends up being killed,
so you don't help people.

01:15:07.968 --> 01:15:10.284
She trusts me and I trust her.

01:15:10.388 --> 01:15:13.869
There's a fine line
between trust and stupidity

01:15:13.973 --> 01:15:18.211
and there's people you don't trust
cos they will stab you in the ribs.

01:15:18.315 --> 01:15:21.461
I thought you had learned
a little bit more than this.

01:15:21.565 --> 01:15:24.003
You need to mind your own business.

01:15:24.107 --> 01:15:27.885
What is going on upstairs
has nothing to do with you.

01:15:27.989 --> 01:15:30.388
You deal with what's going on
right here.

01:15:30.492 --> 01:15:33.722
Mami, save it.
Everybody's business is her business.

01:15:33.826 --> 01:15:37.104
You go ahead, girl.
You're gonna get screwed.

01:15:37.208 --> 01:15:40.604
You're not a queen
because you sit on a throne,

01:15:40.708 --> 01:15:43.902
you're a queen because
you couldn't cut it as a man

01:15:44.006 --> 01:15:46.184
so you had to put on a dress.

01:15:48.774 --> 01:15:51.033
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

01:15:51.137 --> 01:15:53.185
I've had quite enough...

01:16:03.872 --> 01:16:05.966
What the hell?

01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:08.051
Vida, please. No. It's OK.

01:16:08.156 --> 01:16:11.596
Carol Ann, I'm sorry
but I cannot take this any more.

01:16:11.701 --> 01:16:15.180
Noxee, could you take care
of Miss Carol Ann?

01:16:15.285 --> 01:16:18.378
Virgil and I
have something we must discuss.

01:16:20.055 --> 01:16:22.693
So, I gather you like hitting ladies.

01:16:22.797 --> 01:16:25.986
Some ladies need to get hit.

01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:29.644
Then, conversely,
some men need to be hit back.

01:16:35.153 --> 01:16:39.289
Oh, God.
Virgil's gonna hurt Vida so bad.

01:16:39.393 --> 01:16:43.752
Carol Ann, there's something
you should know about Vida, mami.

01:16:43.856 --> 01:16:45.462
Well...

01:16:45.566 --> 01:16:49.047
Vida works out. Vida works out.

01:16:49.152 --> 01:16:50.953
A lot.

01:17:10.355 --> 01:17:12.431
All right, move ahead.

01:17:19.698 --> 01:17:21.691
All right, go ahead.

01:17:26.747 --> 01:17:28.620
Move on.

01:17:32.002 --> 01:17:36.304
Oh, man, sometimes I think we should
just get rid of all the men.

01:17:36.408 --> 01:17:39.890
Well, not all of us...
them are bad.

01:17:39.994 --> 01:17:42.311
We just need to get rid of
all the men.

01:17:42.415 --> 01:17:45.230
You're just post-traumatised.

01:17:45.334 --> 01:17:50.319
Well, maybe Mr Rogers.
I mean, he just seems sensitive.

01:17:50.423 --> 01:17:55.114
- Well, Mel Gibson. He has a cute can.
- Oh, please!

01:17:55.218 --> 01:17:58.940
Yeah. He can stay but
he's not allowed to think or speak.

01:18:08.956 --> 01:18:10.580
Psst!

01:18:15.337 --> 01:18:16.997
Shh!

01:18:25.097 --> 01:18:29.723
My goodness. You're always on time.
And twice as sweet as usual.

01:18:31.186 --> 01:18:33.945
I guess you're never gonna
disappoint me.

01:18:34.049 --> 01:18:38.991
How could I disappoint you? I'm your
knight in a shiny pick-up, remember?

01:18:39.095 --> 01:18:44.997
Of course I remember. My knight
in shining whatever that was.

01:18:45.101 --> 01:18:49.377
Oh, God, it's so beautiful
out tonight, isn't it?

01:18:49.481 --> 01:18:51.049
Yeah.

01:18:51.153 --> 01:18:54.299
My whole life
I've always wanted someone

01:18:54.403 --> 01:18:57.180
who will understand
how I felt inside

01:18:57.284 --> 01:19:00.557
and someone who
would hold me for always

01:19:00.661 --> 01:19:03.835
and then you showed up
and you were it.

01:19:04.928 --> 01:19:08.520
You make me feel like
the most perfect girl.

01:19:08.625 --> 01:19:12.024
I don't have to do that.
You are the perfect girl.

01:19:12.128 --> 01:19:15.156
- Sorry, no.
- I mean it. You're beautiful.

01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:19.282
- Please.
- You've got class, glamour.

01:19:19.386 --> 01:19:21.408
- Shut up.
- You're exotic.

01:19:21.512 --> 01:19:23.829
Stop.

01:19:23.934 --> 01:19:25.832
Oh, don't stop.

01:19:25.937 --> 01:19:30.920
And there's something about
the way that you talk, you know.

01:19:31.024 --> 01:19:34.050
Like no-nonsense. Like...

01:19:34.154 --> 01:19:38.049
You'd never lie to me,
you'd never keep a secret from me.

01:19:38.153 --> 01:19:40.251
I really respect that. I do.

01:19:41.965 --> 01:19:44.181
What is it?

01:19:44.285 --> 01:19:46.186
What did I say?

01:19:46.290 --> 01:19:48.688
I was...

01:19:48.792 --> 01:19:50.857
If you really love someone,

01:19:50.962 --> 01:19:54.183
you could keep
one big secret from them.

01:19:57.439 --> 01:19:59.821
- No.
- No?

01:19:59.925 --> 01:20:04.785
I really feel that if you love somebody
with all of your heart,

01:20:04.889 --> 01:20:09.043
then you could never
keep a secret from them.

01:20:09.148 --> 01:20:13.042
You couldn't even sit on
one little teeny lie?

01:20:13.146 --> 01:20:15.170
- No.
- No.

01:20:15.275 --> 01:20:17.537
No matter how big or how small.

01:20:22.506 --> 01:20:23.723
Oh...

01:20:23.827 --> 01:20:29.227
We're saving Mel Gibson.
With a gag.

01:20:29.331 --> 01:20:33.107
Right. Mr Rogers,
Keanu Reeves, Denzel Washington...

01:20:33.211 --> 01:20:35.970
- And...
- And Bobby Ray.

01:20:37.354 --> 01:20:40.224
Yeah, you mustn't forget
about Bobby Ray.

01:20:42.651 --> 01:20:46.576
Bobby Lee, I've been thinking about
a lot of things lately

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:50.919
and I don't want Bobby Ray
because he's such a local, right?

01:20:51.023 --> 01:20:53.041
So go ahead. You can have him.

01:20:53.146 --> 01:20:57.089
Just take him. He's yours, baby.
Go ahead and take him.

01:20:57.194 --> 01:21:00.591
- Good for you.
- Chi Chi.

01:21:00.695 --> 01:21:04.139
- What?
- That was so very generous of you,

01:21:04.243 --> 01:21:09.143
putting someone else's needs
before your own. It was special.

01:21:09.247 --> 01:21:11.940
It was step three.

01:21:12.044 --> 01:21:16.806
Absolutely step three.
Abide by the rules of love.

01:21:18.312 --> 01:21:22.973
- Really utterly fabulous. Sit here.
- Here, honey.

01:21:24.401 --> 01:21:26.643
Chi Chi...

01:21:27.988 --> 01:21:31.624
I am so very sorry that I called you

01:21:31.728 --> 01:21:35.752
a sway-backed, Third World
little whatever. I didn't mean it.

01:21:35.856 --> 01:21:38.800
It's all right, baby. I deserved it.

01:21:38.904 --> 01:21:40.590
And I'm sorry I called you

01:21:40.694 --> 01:21:44.499
a dinosaur, cellulite,
white trash farty old white woman.

01:21:48.884 --> 01:21:51.209
- Forgiven?
- Forgiven.

01:21:52.596 --> 01:21:55.938
- You are lovely.
- You're too much.

01:21:56.042 --> 01:21:59.319
Are you serious about Bobby Ray,
Miss Chi Chi?

01:21:59.423 --> 01:22:02.698
Baby, you can have him.
I've got a million dream lovers.

01:22:02.802 --> 01:22:05.154
I've got a broken heart
for every light on Broadway

01:22:05.258 --> 01:22:09.646
and when one goes out, I just
screw in another one. Hello, goodbye.

01:22:12.616 --> 01:22:14.655
I think I see him.

01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:18.714
No... Moses.

01:22:18.818 --> 01:22:23.340
I have lived in apartments that
weren't half as big as these pores.

01:22:23.444 --> 01:22:27.765
Let's stay positive. Bobby Lee,
just ignore your old Auntie Noxee

01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:30.099
and look at that videotape there.

01:22:30.203 --> 01:22:33.645
I know. That is Miss Anne Baxter
in The Ten Commandments

01:22:33.749 --> 01:22:36.314
and those are the moves.

01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:40.148
All right, let's see.
She needs more lips.

01:22:40.252 --> 01:22:42.947
- I can't.
- You can and you will, darling.

01:22:43.051 --> 01:22:45.486
But I'm not Miss Anne Baxter.

01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:47.531
No one is asking you to be.

01:22:47.635 --> 01:22:52.205
Just take her strength, her mystery,
her moves and you find your own.

01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:55.290
If you want them to know
that there is steak for dinner,

01:22:55.394 --> 01:22:59.292
you've got to let them
hear it sizzle. Understand?

01:22:59.396 --> 01:23:01.171
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:23:01.275 --> 01:23:03.009
- Thanks.
- Best of luck.

01:23:03.113 --> 01:23:04.926
Time to make the donuts.

01:23:05.031 --> 01:23:07.217
Chi Chi, he won't like me.

01:23:07.322 --> 01:23:10.637
Trust me.
He's gonna love you, all right?

01:23:10.742 --> 01:23:13.558
Baby, you got the look, mami.

01:23:13.662 --> 01:23:17.438
You certainly do. Do that eye thing
I taught you, right?

01:23:17.542 --> 01:23:22.987
That's right. And be honest with him,
all right? He deserves that.

01:23:23.092 --> 01:23:26.679
- Thanks.
- I got to go. I got cramps.

01:23:29.192 --> 01:23:30.651
Momma!

01:23:40.787 --> 01:23:42.669
Chi Chi?

01:23:42.774 --> 01:23:45.618
Bobby Ray, come here.

01:23:49.004 --> 01:23:51.053
Hello?

01:23:51.157 --> 01:23:53.456
Oh! Hello.

01:23:55.093 --> 01:23:57.309
Bobby Lee!

01:23:57.413 --> 01:24:00.637
- Roberta.
- Oh, Roberta.

01:24:02.225 --> 01:24:06.175
Wow. You really look pretty.

01:24:07.314 --> 01:24:10.572
Sure is a pretty dress
you're wearing.

01:24:10.677 --> 01:24:13.023
Oh, this old thing?

01:24:15.238 --> 01:24:17.997
Well... Roberta...

01:24:18.102 --> 01:24:20.363
would you?

01:24:22.079 --> 01:24:26.259
Wow. You really look good
in that dress.

01:24:26.363 --> 01:24:29.618
Oh, Bobby Ray, Bobby Ray, Bobby Ray.

01:24:31.672 --> 01:24:34.044
Would you like to dance with me?

01:24:47.896 --> 01:24:51.321
~ Hold me, hold me... ~
- Miss Beatrice,

01:24:51.426 --> 01:24:55.324
- I've waited 23 years to ask you this.
~ Never let me go until you've told me ~

01:24:55.429 --> 01:24:58.996
- May I have this dance?
- My gracious.

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.794
~ What I want to know ~

01:25:01.899 --> 01:25:06.254
~ And then just hold me, hold me ~

01:25:06.358 --> 01:25:11.871
~ Make me tell you
I'm in love with you ~

01:25:17.426 --> 01:25:20.812
~ Thrill me, thrill me ~

01:25:20.917 --> 01:25:26.233
~ Walk me down the lane
where shadows will be ~

01:25:26.338 --> 01:25:33.243
~ Will be hiding lovers
just the same as we'll be ~

01:25:33.347 --> 01:25:41.347
~ We'll be when you make me
tell you I love you ~

01:25:45.746 --> 01:25:52.679
~ They told me
be sensible with your new love ~

01:25:52.783 --> 01:25:57.432
~ Don't be fooled thinking
this is the last you'll find... ~

01:25:57.537 --> 01:25:59.934
- You know, pumpkins?
- What?

01:26:00.038 --> 01:26:02.679
Sometimes it just takes a fairy.

01:26:09.102 --> 01:26:14.781
~... drive me slowly out of my mind ~

01:26:14.885 --> 01:26:17.829
~ Kiss me Kiss me ~

01:26:17.933 --> 01:26:19.913
~ And when you do ~

01:26:20.017 --> 01:26:23.624
~ I know that you will miss me
Miss me... ~

01:26:23.728 --> 01:26:27.034
Men, acting like women.

01:26:28.622 --> 01:26:32.951
Men wanting to be with one another,
men touching each other.

01:26:34.127 --> 01:26:38.706
Their stubbly chins
rubbing up against one another.

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:44.383
Touching each other.

01:26:45.681 --> 01:26:47.804
Manly hands...

01:26:50.102 --> 01:26:52.390
touching swirls of chest hair.

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:59.649
An occasional whiff
of a rugged aftershave.

01:27:03.198 --> 01:27:06.207
Their low, baritone voices...

01:27:06.312 --> 01:27:09.120
sighing, grunting.

01:27:11.665 --> 01:27:17.011
They hold one another
in manly, masculine arms.

01:27:17.115 --> 01:27:19.625
Hold one another.

01:27:23.593 --> 01:27:25.800
Tight.

01:27:46.908 --> 01:27:50.833
- How you doing?
- OK, I'm doing OK.

01:27:50.938 --> 01:27:54.495
- What can I get you?
- Bourbon.

01:28:04.176 --> 01:28:08.043
- This your shoe?
- No, that ain't my shoe.

01:28:09.723 --> 01:28:13.306
I'm looking for the person
that wore that shoe.

01:28:22.736 --> 01:28:26.235
- Now the ratchet.
- The ratchet...

01:28:27.324 --> 01:28:33.002
You know, if I can get this to work,
you may get this baby on the road.

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:35.922
Really? That would be wonderful.

01:28:36.026 --> 01:28:41.307
Of course, I'm sure you'll be wanting
to stick around

01:28:41.411 --> 01:28:44.472
for the Strawberry Social
this afternoon.

01:28:44.577 --> 01:28:47.040
- Now, Vida...
- Ca...

01:28:48.679 --> 01:28:51.022
You know,

01:28:51.126 --> 01:28:55.392
I wouldn't be lying
if I were to say...

01:28:56.478 --> 01:28:59.781
that I was really gonna miss you.

01:28:59.886 --> 01:29:05.313
I think it's really important
for a woman to have lady friends.

01:29:07.155 --> 01:29:09.065
Oh, Carol Ann, I...

01:29:11.618 --> 01:29:16.503
If we're going to be friends, there
really is something I should tell you.

01:29:16.608 --> 01:29:19.885
- Adam's apple?
- What?

01:29:19.989 --> 01:29:24.429
Adam's apple.
Women don't have Adam's apples.

01:29:24.533 --> 01:29:27.560
Only men have Adam's apples.

01:29:27.664 --> 01:29:29.683
The first night you came to town,

01:29:29.787 --> 01:29:33.889
I noticed that you had yourself
an Adam's apple.

01:29:35.517 --> 01:29:38.637
- Then you know?
- I know...

01:29:40.105 --> 01:29:44.656
that I'm very fortunate
to have a lady friend

01:29:44.761 --> 01:29:48.068
who just happens to have
an Adam's apple.

01:29:49.823 --> 01:29:52.492
Let's just see what we got here.

01:29:54.745 --> 01:29:57.799
Ooh!

01:29:57.903 --> 01:29:59.865
You did it. Yes!

01:30:01.501 --> 01:30:04.668
God, I ain't ever gonna be right.

01:30:29.655 --> 01:30:31.612
Ta-da!

01:30:32.407 --> 01:30:34.456
How do I look?

01:30:34.561 --> 01:30:38.069
Like the Miami Sound Machine
just exploded all over you.

01:30:39.164 --> 01:30:43.261
We have the town
surrounded. There's no escape.

01:30:43.365 --> 01:30:46.012
I know there's drag queens
around here.

01:30:46.116 --> 01:30:49.421
Just come out with your hands up,
no one will get hurt.

01:30:51.718 --> 01:30:56.676
Oh, what fresh hell is this?
It's possibly-dead Sheriff Dollard.

01:30:57.975 --> 01:31:00.651
He doesn't look dead.

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:05.140
I know them drag queens is here,
I'm not leaving without them!

01:31:08.902 --> 01:31:12.039
None of you good people
need get involved.

01:31:12.143 --> 01:31:15.001
All I want's them drag queens.

01:31:15.105 --> 01:31:17.531
Don't protect these freaks!

01:31:18.078 --> 01:31:20.210
I know they're hiding here,

01:31:20.315 --> 01:31:23.797
these weirdos coming in here,
these boys in dresses.

01:31:23.902 --> 01:31:26.034
What? Boys in dresses?

01:31:27.129 --> 01:31:29.555
Corrupting you
with their way of life,

01:31:29.659 --> 01:31:33.140
changing the way
things have always been!

01:31:33.244 --> 01:31:36.254
I really don't think
that's what you want!

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.907
Whoever belongs to this shoe...

01:31:46.011 --> 01:31:48.270
come forward now!

01:32:24.353 --> 01:32:26.844
There's Miss Vida, come on.

01:32:45.666 --> 01:32:48.370
I believe that shoe is mine.

01:32:49.419 --> 01:32:52.140
- You ain't the one.
- She's not the one.

01:32:52.244 --> 01:32:54.787
Back off, Virgil.

01:32:56.802 --> 01:32:58.895
I am a drag queen.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.758
I know there's drag queens
in this town!

01:33:06.436 --> 01:33:09.556
And I ain't leaving
till they get out here!

01:33:12.609 --> 01:33:17.040
- Can I have my shoe, please?
- You're a drag queen?

01:33:17.144 --> 01:33:19.956
Nothing this pretty could be real.

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:22.210
You want to touch my boa?

01:33:22.315 --> 01:33:26.382
That's my shoe. Ten and a half B,
girlfriend.

01:33:26.487 --> 01:33:29.344
- I'm a boy in a dress.
- Give me a kiss, big boy.

01:33:29.448 --> 01:33:32.094
- I'm the drag king.
- I'm a drag queen, too.

01:33:32.199 --> 01:33:34.891
- Arrest us.
- I'm a drag queen over here.

01:33:34.995 --> 01:33:38.141
So you can just
drag yourself on home.

01:33:38.245 --> 01:33:42.143
What you so afraid of?

01:33:42.247 --> 01:33:45.776
You're gonna really regret this.
You're gonna regret this.

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:51.770
You have no idea how dangerous
these people really are!

01:33:52.649 --> 01:33:55.769
No idea! You're gonna regret it!

01:33:56.862 --> 01:34:00.694
All of you are gonna regret it!
I promise you will!

01:34:51.291 --> 01:34:53.035
Miss Vida?

01:34:54.127 --> 01:34:56.001
Auntie Noxee?

01:35:18.735 --> 01:35:22.161
- Are you hearing this?
- Yes.

01:35:22.265 --> 01:35:27.085
I didn't even want to come here, now
these people are standing up for us?

01:35:27.190 --> 01:35:30.114
You know, Vida...

01:35:31.331 --> 01:35:33.924
you were absolutely right.

01:35:34.029 --> 01:35:36.260
About what?

01:35:36.364 --> 01:35:39.262
I mean, now I realise that...

01:35:39.366 --> 01:35:42.265
you gotta take chances.

01:35:42.369 --> 01:35:45.684
Because you never know,
you know what I mean?

01:35:45.788 --> 01:35:49.232
I'm not gonna worry about
if people accept me or not.

01:35:49.337 --> 01:35:53.804
I'm gonna make Hollywood
wherever I am at.

01:35:57.524 --> 01:35:59.600
I would like...

01:36:01.361 --> 01:36:03.935
Stand up, Vida.

01:36:05.365 --> 01:36:07.830
I would like...

01:36:07.935 --> 01:36:12.295
to go to Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania

01:36:12.399 --> 01:36:16.297
and walk into that imitation
Tudor-style house...

01:36:16.401 --> 01:36:18.719
Stand up, Vida. Stand up.

01:36:18.824 --> 01:36:23.724
And I will say,
"My name is Miss Vida Boheme."

01:36:23.829 --> 01:36:27.309
- Go ahead, girl.
- "Your approval is not needed."

01:36:27.413 --> 01:36:30.313
Approval neither desired
nor required.

01:36:30.417 --> 01:36:33.890
"But I will take your acceptance."

01:36:34.978 --> 01:36:40.241
Me, too. I'm gonna stand up
from now on, I'm going to.

01:36:40.345 --> 01:36:42.955
And when I find
my honest and true love,

01:36:43.059 --> 01:36:45.327
I'm never gonna let him go.

01:36:45.431 --> 01:36:48.293
And I don't care
what my cousin Lisette says.

01:36:48.397 --> 01:36:50.960
Everything I touch
doesn't turn into caca.

01:36:51.064 --> 01:36:53.335
- What does she know?
- Right.

01:36:53.439 --> 01:36:55.962
And I'm gonna try and find
a foundation

01:36:56.066 --> 01:36:59.908
that's a little closer
to my actual skin tone.

01:37:10.639 --> 01:37:13.723
Idiots! Look at them!

01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:17.652
Look at them. Perverts.

01:37:17.756 --> 01:37:22.364
When the founding fathers wrote
the Declaration of Independence

01:37:22.468 --> 01:37:24.575
and the Constitution,

01:37:24.679 --> 01:37:27.911
"Liberty and justice for all",
they didn't mean that.

01:37:28.016 --> 01:37:31.792
I can tell you one thing about them
founding fathers of America.

01:37:31.897 --> 01:37:36.198
- What's that?
- They sure had fabulous wigs.

01:37:58.812 --> 01:38:01.647
~ Do what you wanna do ~

01:38:08.155 --> 01:38:10.313
~ Do what you wanna do... ~

01:38:12.409 --> 01:38:14.449
You'd better feel it.

01:38:16.913 --> 01:38:19.665
~ Do what you wanna do ~

01:38:26.590 --> 01:38:28.547
~ Do what you wanna do... ~

01:38:31.053 --> 01:38:33.185
This is my Aunt Martha's dress.

01:38:33.289 --> 01:38:36.772
I thought you could use it,
she was big in the shoulders.

01:38:36.876 --> 01:38:40.764
- Thank you, girl.
- Oh, sweet pea.

01:38:41.855 --> 01:38:45.825
Listen to your Auntie Vida.
I want you to believe in yourself,

01:38:45.929 --> 01:38:50.203
imagine good things and moisturise,
I cannot stress this enough.

01:38:50.307 --> 01:38:52.413
Miss Noxeema.

01:38:52.517 --> 01:38:54.456
Miss Clara.

01:38:54.561 --> 01:38:58.292
Now, listen,
when you get to Hollywood,

01:38:58.397 --> 01:39:02.468
you give this letter
to Mr Robert Mitchum.

01:39:02.573 --> 01:39:06.467
I will. I promise you.
I'll guard it with my life.

01:39:06.571 --> 01:39:08.928
Thank you. I'm gonna miss you.

01:39:09.032 --> 01:39:11.472
I'm gonna miss you, too.

01:39:11.576 --> 01:39:14.221
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

01:39:19.059 --> 01:39:23.072
I hope she leaves me those albums
in her will.

01:39:23.177 --> 01:39:27.493
- All right. Can I hear it?
- Good afternoon.

01:39:27.598 --> 01:39:31.492
Sounds wonderful. The shirt is fierce
and the hair is working.

01:39:31.596 --> 01:39:34.414
Take care. Be good to yourself.

01:39:34.518 --> 01:39:36.707
Vaya con Dios, Miss Chi Chi.

01:39:36.811 --> 01:39:39.672
You ruin my language
and I still love you.

01:39:39.777 --> 01:39:45.508
- These all grow wild around here.
- You all grow wild around here.

01:39:45.613 --> 01:39:48.889
This reminds me of Princess Laritza
in Revenge Of The Wench.

01:39:48.993 --> 01:39:51.345
Everybody thought she was dead

01:39:51.450 --> 01:39:54.184
but she had taken
this magical concoction...

01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:57.712
- Anyway, bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:40:00.767 --> 01:40:02.760
Vida...

01:40:06.356 --> 01:40:09.108
Come with us. Please?

01:40:10.027 --> 01:40:12.952
Oh, Lord.

01:40:13.057 --> 01:40:17.915
If you had any idea
of how many nights I've lain awake,

01:40:18.019 --> 01:40:21.169
just thinking about
how to get out of here.

01:40:21.273 --> 01:40:24.200
But it's my home.

01:40:25.626 --> 01:40:28.718
Besides, I got these girls to raise.

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:30.871
I know.

01:40:33.634 --> 01:40:35.922
I love you, Miss Vida Boheme.

01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:46.928
I've waited my whole life to hear
those words said to that name.

01:40:48.023 --> 01:40:51.410
And I'm very, very, very happy...

01:40:51.514 --> 01:40:54.355
that you're the one to say them.

01:41:00.077 --> 01:41:01.868
What?

01:41:05.457 --> 01:41:07.746
I have a lovely idea.

01:41:13.799 --> 01:41:16.372
I want you to have this.

01:41:17.469 --> 01:41:19.601
I don't know if
you know who she is...

01:41:19.706 --> 01:41:23.808
It's Julie Newmar. I always thought
she was so statuesque.

01:41:24.643 --> 01:41:26.932
My feelings exactly!

01:41:30.732 --> 01:41:32.641
- Well...
- Well...

01:41:42.119 --> 01:41:43.827
Vida!

01:41:45.998 --> 01:41:48.636
I don't think of you as a man.

01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:51.579
And I don't think of you
as a woman.

01:41:52.671 --> 01:41:54.747
I think of you as an angel.

01:41:56.508 --> 01:41:58.999
I think that's healthy.

01:42:49.770 --> 01:42:52.177
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:42:53.565 --> 01:42:58.061
The winner of this year's
Drag Queen Of America contest...

01:42:59.279 --> 01:43:01.661
~ Hey, now. Hey, now ~

01:43:01.765 --> 01:43:04.000
~ What's the matter with you? ~

01:43:04.104 --> 01:43:08.506
~ Girls just wanna have fun now
Yeah, yeah, yeah... ~

01:43:08.610 --> 01:43:12.760
Step four. Larger than life
is just the right size.

01:43:12.865 --> 01:43:17.514
~... my mother says, "When you gonna
live your life right?"... ~

01:43:17.618 --> 01:43:20.507
Miss Chi Chi Rodriguez!

01:43:22.469 --> 01:43:26.816
~... and girls, they wanna have fun ~

01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:32.236
~ Whoa, girls, they wanna have
Hey, now. Hey, now ~

01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:34.655
~ What's the matter with you? ~

01:43:34.759 --> 01:43:39.450
~ Girls just wanna have fun now... ~

01:43:39.554 --> 01:43:41.787
Presenting the crown,

01:43:41.892 --> 01:43:45.040
Miss Julie Newmar!

01:43:45.144 --> 01:43:49.335
~... what you gonna do with your life? ~

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:53.382
~ Oh, Daddy dear,
you know you're still number one ~

01:43:53.487 --> 01:43:56.412
~ But girls, they wanna have fun ~

01:43:57.713 --> 01:44:00.889
~ Whoa, girls, they wanna have ~

01:44:00.993 --> 01:44:05.562
~ That's all they really want ~

01:44:05.666 --> 01:44:09.734
~ Some fun ~

01:44:09.838 --> 01:44:14.027
~ When the working day is done ~

01:44:14.131 --> 01:44:18.534
~ You know, girls,
they wanna have fun ~

01:44:18.639 --> 01:44:22.201
~ Come on
Hey, now. Hey, now ~

01:44:22.305 --> 01:44:24.411
~ What's the matter with you? ~

01:44:24.515 --> 01:44:28.247
~ Girls just wanna have fun now ~

01:44:28.352 --> 01:44:31.668
~ Come on
Hey, now. Hey, now ~

01:44:31.773 --> 01:44:33.924
~ What's the matter with you? ~

01:44:34.028 --> 01:44:37.582
~ Girls just wanna have fun now ~

01:44:43.342 --> 01:44:45.935
~ Do you wanna be free, yeah? ~

01:44:46.039 --> 01:44:49.131
~ Oh, oh ~

01:44:51.433 --> 01:44:53.591
~ Do you wanna be free, yeah? ~

01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:56.809
~ Just free yourself ~

01:44:58.649 --> 01:45:00.522
~ Just free yourself ~

01:45:01.818 --> 01:45:05.576
~ Take a look at yourself
What do you see? ~

01:45:05.681 --> 01:45:09.164
~ A willing victim of mediocrity ~

01:45:09.269 --> 01:45:13.506
~ No one told you
you can't have it all ~

01:45:13.610 --> 01:45:16.800
~ It's time to act up and have a ball ~

01:45:16.904 --> 01:45:18.924
~ You've got to free yourself ~

01:45:19.028 --> 01:45:21.467
~ Gonna change that vibe ~

01:45:21.571 --> 01:45:25.433
~ Free yourself
Leave the past behind ~

01:45:25.537 --> 01:45:27.103
~ See yourself ~

01:45:27.207 --> 01:45:30.769
~ In a different light
There is no one else ~

01:45:30.873 --> 01:45:32.923
~ Just free yourself ~

01:45:33.934 --> 01:45:37.570
~ There'll be those who say
what you're doing is wrong ~

01:45:37.674 --> 01:45:41.320
~ You can't listen to fools
You've got to be strong ~

01:45:41.425 --> 01:45:45.618
~ Close your eyes
any place that you can be ~

01:45:45.723 --> 01:45:49.498
~ Be what you want yourself to be ~

01:45:49.603 --> 01:45:54.171
~ I can show you how to go to ~

01:45:54.275 --> 01:45:57.172
~ To heaven ~

01:45:57.276 --> 01:46:01.845
~ Ordinary, it's left standing ~

01:46:01.949 --> 01:46:04.846
~ Just leave them in my past ~

01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:07.017
~ You've got to Free yourself ~

01:46:07.121 --> 01:46:08.936
~ Gotta change that vibe ~

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:12.852
~ Why don't you be yourself?
Leave the past behind ~

01:46:12.956 --> 01:46:15.025
~ It's time to see yourself ~

01:46:15.129 --> 01:46:19.596

~ Oh, oh ~

01:47:14.534 --> 01:47:17.838
~ Just free yourself
Do you wanna be free, yeah? ~

01:47:17.942 --> 01:47:22.132
~ I can show you how to go to ~

01:47:22.236 --> 01:47:25.218
~ The head of your class ~

01:47:25.322 --> 01:47:33.015
~ Ordinary, it's left standing
In the past ~

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:36.687

~ Why don't you be yourself? ~

~ Don't you want to be free?
