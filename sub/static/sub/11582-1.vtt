(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.204 --> 00:04.638
sexually-based offenses

00:04.672 --> 00:06.407
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.176
In New York City,

00:08.209 --> 00:09.277
the dedicated detectives

00:09.310 --> 00:11.179
who investigate these vicious
felonies are members

00:11.212 --> 00:13.314
of an elite squad known as the
Special Victims Unit

00:14.815 --> 00:17.118
These are their stories.

00:18.319 --> 00:21.422
[crying]

00:21.455 --> 00:23.391
Daddy! Daddy!

00:23.424 --> 00:25.793
Hey, what's the matter,
baby?

00:25.826 --> 00:27.128
Did you fall?

00:27.161 --> 00:28.296
No, the boy!

00:28.329 --> 00:29.697
What boy?

00:29.730 --> 00:32.066
On the bike.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.802
Well, what did he
do to you, honey?

00:34.835 --> 00:37.138
He grabbed me
and pulled my ears

00:37.171 --> 00:38.272
so that I would
go with him.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.407
Oh, God.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.310
Hey, he hurt your daughter?

00:42.343 --> 00:43.511
Yeah, he tried
to kidnap her.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.545
You got a cell phone?
Yeah.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.247
All right.
Call the cops.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.183
It's okay, baby.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.400
(Bike cop)
Patricia Branson,
six years old.

01:06.434 --> 01:09.137
Dad's reading the Times,
perv tries to snatch her

01:09.170 --> 01:10.104
in a park
full of people.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.272
(Stabler)
Anybody see anything?

01:11.305 --> 01:12.173
Only description we got

01:12.206 --> 01:13.641
is a white guy
wearing a baseball cap.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.209
Bystander chased him,

01:15.243 --> 01:16.810
but perp got away
on his own bike.

01:16.844 --> 01:20.114
What was he gonna do,
tie her to his handlebars?

01:20.148 --> 01:22.483
Girl's father.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.152
Mr. Branson.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.287
I'm Detective Benson.
This is Detective Stabler.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.555
Special Victims Unit.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.889
The bastard tried
to pull my daughter

01:28.922 --> 01:31.192
over the fence
by her hair.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.161
Ripped it right out
of her head.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.796
I--I just took my eyes
off Patty for a second.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.498
You know, the important thing
is that she's safe,

01:37.531 --> 01:39.233
but we do
need to talk to her.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.901
Well, I'll stay with her.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.503
Well, if it's okay,
sir, victims Patty's age

01:42.536 --> 01:45.206
are usually more comfortable
talking one on one.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.574
And I need to get some
information from you.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.243
Okay? Come on.
Thanks.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.646
Hey, give us a minute?

01:52.680 --> 01:56.450
Patty, my name is Olivia.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.886
Hi. I'm a police officer.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.821
How are you feeling?

02:00.854 --> 02:02.856
My head hurts.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.792
Because the man
pulled your hair?

02:04.825 --> 02:08.496
He wanted me
to go with him.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.930
Where did he
want you to go?

02:09.963 --> 02:12.200
To play with Dinky.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.601
Who's Dinky?

02:13.634 --> 02:16.270
His puppy.

02:16.304 --> 02:19.340
He let me pet him
the other time.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.742
So you've
seen this man before?

02:21.775 --> 02:24.845
When he showed me
his puppy.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.897
I talked to every kid,
nanny, and parent

03:16.930 --> 03:17.998
at that playground.

03:18.031 --> 03:18.832
Nobody's ever
seen the guy.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.468
I checked with
the local precinct.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.835
No similar complaints.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.271
The bike rules out
a snatch attempt,

03:23.304 --> 03:24.472
so we're talking perv.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.506
A perv who's
done his homework.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.007
I think he knows
Patty's movements.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.009
He's tried that doggie lure
trick on her once before.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.811
Okay, so he tries to lift her
over the fence

03:30.844 --> 03:32.513
and take her where?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.715
A dozen places within 100 yards
of that playground.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.784
where he could have taken Patty
to play doctor.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.319
How is she?

03:38.352 --> 03:40.020
Aside from
that scalp injury, okay.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.555
No signs of sexual assault.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.924
Patty's his fantasy girl.
He's not gonna give up.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.726
Family lives
on the west side.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.661
We're gonna get a better
description out of Patty.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.763
Canvass the neighborhood.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.931
How's it going?

03:50.964 --> 03:53.401
Olivia's just
getting her warmed up.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.403
(Stabler)
Mr. and Mrs. Branson,
this is my boss,

03:55.436 --> 03:56.537
Captain Cragen.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.272
Patty's seen this man
twice now.

03:58.306 --> 04:00.974
She's scared to death
he's gonna come back.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.042
We're doing everything
we can to find him.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.345
Have either one of you
noticed anyone following you?

04:04.378 --> 04:08.949
We never thought
to look until today.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.017
Any time besides
when Patty's at school

04:10.050 --> 04:11.485
that she's away from you?

04:11.519 --> 04:13.387
I'm home,
and we don't have a nanny.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.055
Patty's always
with one of us.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.990
Olivia's
about to start.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.960
Can I have the brown,
please?

04:19.993 --> 04:22.363
Absolutely.
What's that for?

04:22.396 --> 04:24.298
(Patty)
Her hair.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.866
You know, Patty,
I wanted to ask you

04:25.899 --> 04:27.968
about the man
in the park.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.003
What color
was his shirt?

04:30.037 --> 04:31.539
Blue.

04:31.572 --> 04:32.773
Yeah?

04:32.806 --> 04:34.942
What color was his hat?

04:34.975 --> 04:35.943
It was red.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.878
Like Jimmy's.

04:37.911 --> 04:38.912
My cousin.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.315
He's a big boy.
Yeah?

04:41.349 --> 04:45.519
Is the person that hurt you
a man, or is he a big boy?

04:45.553 --> 04:47.821
A big boy.

04:47.855 --> 04:51.024
Patty, will you tell me
about the big boy's dog?

04:51.058 --> 04:54.027
Not a dog.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.897
I told you,
Dinky's a puppy.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.032
Well, where were you
when you saw Dinky?

04:59.066 --> 05:01.669
I was riding the horse.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.371
That doesn't
make any sense.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.506
Patty's never
been on a horse.

05:05.539 --> 05:08.409
Did the big boy
say anything to you?

05:08.442 --> 05:09.977
He said he wanted
to see my bracelet.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.612
Yeah?
May I see it?

05:13.581 --> 05:15.516
Thanks.
Who gave that to you?

05:15.549 --> 05:17.117
The doctor.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.653
It says
I have diabetes.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.389
May I have
the green, please?

05:21.422 --> 05:22.790
Sure.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.058
Patty, when you
were riding the horse,

05:25.092 --> 05:26.694
was that in the park?

05:26.727 --> 05:29.430
Not a real horse,
silly.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.931
Well, what kind of horse?

05:30.964 --> 05:34.067
You know, the kind
where you put the money in.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.736
Oh, God.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.539
The ride in front
of the supermarket!

05:38.572 --> 05:40.374
Down the block
from our apartment.

05:40.408 --> 05:42.109
There was a teenager.
He showed her his dog.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.844
Did you get
a good look at him?

05:43.877 --> 05:45.012
(Mom)
I think so.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.114
But I can't describe him.

05:47.147 --> 05:50.384
It's like he's
following her everywhere.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.519
We'll put detectives
in front of your building

05:51.552 --> 05:53.621
until we're sure
Patty is safe.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.523
(Patty)
May I have
some apple juice, please?

05:55.556 --> 05:56.890
Oh, um--

05:56.924 --> 05:58.492
She knows to ask
when her sugar is low.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.394
I have a juice box
in here.

06:00.428 --> 06:01.795
(Cragen)
You can take it to her.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.001
Let's retrace Patty's steps
for the last week.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.037
I'll have Munch and Fin
hit the supermarket.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.611
(Fin)
Anybody ever
use that thing?

06:17.645 --> 06:19.413
(store manager)
Kids ride that horse
all day long.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.548
How about her?

06:20.581 --> 06:21.615
Sorry.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.584
Be glad
to ask my employees.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.653
(Fin)
Could you ask them
if they've seen anybody strange

06:25.686 --> 06:27.120
hanging around
outside of here?

06:27.154 --> 06:29.490
Does that include
two guys in a blue van?

06:29.523 --> 06:31.492
What'd they look like?

06:31.525 --> 06:33.461
Both white, middle-aged guy
behind the wheel.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.795
Teenager riding shotgun.

06:34.828 --> 06:35.996
Some mutt in his lap.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.431
When was this?

06:37.465 --> 06:38.699
Last week.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.768
Parked right by the front door,
blocking all my deliveries.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.169
You ask him to move?
Yeah.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.505
The driver told me
to call the cops.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.673
I did.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.207
I told them Arizona plates
and the number.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.542
Nobody showed up.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.043
You still got
the license plate number?

06:50.077 --> 06:51.579
On my desk in the store.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.516
We got a pair
of pedophiles.

06:55.549 --> 06:56.850
With their very own
perv mobile.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.586
A molester doesn't
usually share his children

06:58.619 --> 06:59.787
till he's done with them.

06:59.820 --> 07:00.888
Older guy could be
paying the kid

07:00.921 --> 07:02.089
to snatch his prey
for him,

07:02.122 --> 07:03.491
or the kid could be
dependent upon him.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.593
Like an old kidnap victim
all grown up.

07:05.626 --> 07:08.228
(Dispatcher)
SVU mobile unit,
I have your plate.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.362
Ready to copy,
Central.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.999
Registered to a '96
Ford Econoline van.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.934
No warrants, but subject
of an intel report

07:13.967 --> 07:15.503
from the 22.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.637
Filed by who?

07:16.670 --> 07:18.472
School Safety at PS 45.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.007
That's Patty Branson's school.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.610
I would have wrote him
a summons

07:22.643 --> 07:23.744
if I had the authority.

07:23.777 --> 07:24.778
What did he do?

07:24.812 --> 07:26.246
He parked
in the teacher's zone.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.048
Ignored me when I told him
to move the vehicle.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.550
So you filed
an intel report.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.084
Yeah, 'cause he sat there
watching the kiddies

07:31.118 --> 07:32.152
till after dismissal.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.220
It didn't feel right.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.622
Anybody else in the van?

07:34.655 --> 07:35.556
No, not that I saw.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.658
Give us a call if he
shows up again, okay?

07:37.691 --> 07:38.659
Yeah, you got it.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.828
Patty's school,
her neighborhood, the park.

07:40.861 --> 07:41.962
Got her routine down cold.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.697
A perv drives
all the way from Arizona

07:43.731 --> 07:44.698
to snatch a kid?

07:44.732 --> 07:45.599
Maybe he got made.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.200
Maybe he had to get
the hell out of Dodge.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.736
We should call
the Arizona police.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.704
Still, there's thousands
of little girls out there.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.640
This guy wants Patty.
Why her?

07:52.673 --> 07:54.742
He's obsessed?

07:54.775 --> 07:57.144
He's here.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.646
Blue van.
Right on the corner.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.850
Arizona plates.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.118
Circle around.
Call for backup.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.757
Plate matches the van
at the supermarket.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.758
Any movement?

08:10.791 --> 08:11.859
Not since
we called you.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.627
(Fin)
How many inside?

08:13.661 --> 08:14.461
(Benson)
Driver's all
we can make out.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.163
He's a white guy
reading the newspaper.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.865
We can't see his face.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.299
Heads up,
back of the van.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.935
(Munch)
The big boy,
tried to snatch Patty.

08:21.969 --> 08:24.738
(Benson)
Complete with
red baseball cap.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.540
We got 15 minutes
until school lets out.

08:26.574 --> 08:29.242
He's gonna mix with the mommies
waiting on their kids.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.214
We gonna
take him in the act?

08:34.247 --> 08:35.849
No, there's too many
kids and parents around.

08:35.883 --> 08:39.286
I don't want to spook him
or risk anybody getting hurt.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.154
Here's what we're gonna do.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.905
You gotta move this.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.239
What?

08:59.272 --> 09:00.641
This is Board of Ed
parking.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.743
You gotta move.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.645
Get lost, all right?

09:04.678 --> 09:05.746
I got one of those,
too.

09:05.779 --> 09:06.680
Where's your I.D. card?

09:06.714 --> 09:07.715
Hey, you know what?

09:07.748 --> 09:10.784
Gold shield doesn't mean
I answer to you, okay?

09:10.818 --> 09:12.019
(Cragen)
You answer to me.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.923
It's an IAB caper, captain.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.692
What's
today's color?

09:18.726 --> 09:19.860
Purple.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.830
Wrong.
Turn off the engine
and step out of the vehicle.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.841
Hey! Police!
We gotta talk to you.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.311
[horns honking]

09:38.345 --> 09:40.814
[tires screech]

09:41.882 --> 09:48.121
[sirens blaring]

09:53.093 --> 09:54.728
[brakes screech]

09:58.198 --> 10:00.834
[sirens]

10:11.211 --> 10:12.412
You okay?

10:12.445 --> 10:13.681
Fine.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.784
Get out of the car!
Let me see your hands!

10:16.817 --> 10:18.986
Let me see your hands!

10:19.019 --> 10:20.888
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

10:20.921 --> 10:22.856
I'm coming out!

10:22.890 --> 10:25.392
I'm coming out.
I need an ambulance.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.728
Unh!

10:27.761 --> 10:30.263
I have I.D.!
Back pocket!

10:33.100 --> 10:35.769
It's a private
investigator's license.

10:35.803 --> 10:36.970
Where'd you get this?

10:37.004 --> 10:38.438
From the state of New York.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.140
You're under arrest
for kidnapping of a child

10:40.173 --> 10:41.408
and reckless endangerment.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.076
You have the right
to remain silent.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.912
If you give up that right,
anything you say

10:44.945 --> 10:46.847
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.151
$3,000 worth of damage
to the car?

10:51.184 --> 10:52.686
What can I tell you?

10:52.720 --> 10:53.821
I zigged when
I should have zagged.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.222
What do we got
on this perp?

10:55.255 --> 10:57.057
He's a P.I.
named Peter Carson

10:57.090 --> 10:58.425
licensed in New York
and Arizona.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.861
Guy's got a reputation
for rescuing kids

11:00.894 --> 11:01.995
from all over
the country,

11:02.029 --> 11:04.197
and then reuniting them
with their custodial parent.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.065
With no thought

11:05.098 --> 11:06.867
for the psychological damage
he inflicts.

11:06.900 --> 11:07.968
A baby bounty hunter.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.803
50 grand a pop,
plus expenses.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.138
It's a lucrative gig.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.205
What about "Baseball Cap"?

11:12.239 --> 11:15.208
Well, P.I. ticket's legit.
His name is Kenneth Pratt.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.244
23, also lives in Tucson.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.880
So someone hired them
to snatch Patty.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.849
Well, that makes sense,
but nobody's talking.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.884
(Cragen)
Mr. and Mrs. Branson?

11:23.917 --> 11:25.352
Is this really necessary?

11:25.385 --> 11:27.254
I could do it.
I might recognize him.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.221
Your daughter
is the only one

11:28.255 --> 11:30.290
who saw the man
who attacked her in the park.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.125
We can't charge him
or his partner

11:32.159 --> 11:34.161
without Patty's I.D.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.396
Okay.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.767
Can't my mom come in?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.301
You know what, sweetie?
She's right outside.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.970
And we're gonna
call her in here

11:43.003 --> 11:44.104
as soon as we're done.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.705
Okay?

11:47.340 --> 11:50.243
You remember
what to do?

11:50.277 --> 11:52.813
What if he
gets mad at me?

11:52.846 --> 11:54.848
Can I pick you up?

11:56.349 --> 11:58.786
I wanna show you something.
You see that window?

11:58.819 --> 12:00.453
It's magic.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.058
'Cause anyone
who's standing in here...

12:06.393 --> 12:09.062
They can't see through,
can they?

12:09.096 --> 12:10.297
Okay.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.206
(Cop)
Let's go, gentlemen,
stay on the line.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.308
Number one,
move down to the end.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.882
Face the mirror,
numbers up.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.820
What's the matter,
Patty?

12:32.853 --> 12:34.154
I'm scared.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.288
Why are you scared?

12:35.322 --> 12:37.290
[sniffles]

12:37.324 --> 12:40.227
(Patty)
The boy with the four.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.998
Honey, why are you
scared of number four?

12:45.032 --> 12:48.902
He pulled my hair
at the park.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.004
She saw me in the park.
So what?

12:51.038 --> 12:53.106
So you're looking at attempted
kidnapping and assault

12:53.140 --> 12:54.942
unless you tell us
who hired you.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.277
I can't talk about
an ongoing investigation.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.345
I think he's lying.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.312
(Kenny)
About what?

12:59.346 --> 13:00.981
About what they were
really doing in the park.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.449
Freelancing?

13:02.482 --> 13:04.084
Freelancing?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.986
You know, trying
to pick up a little girl

13:06.019 --> 13:07.454
for your own pleasure.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.922
You calling me
a pervert?

13:08.956 --> 13:09.990
Come on, Pete,
don't go sensitive on us.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.158
No, I got a job to do,

13:11.191 --> 13:12.392
and it's no different
than yours.

13:12.425 --> 13:13.493
It's a lot different.

13:13.526 --> 13:14.828
We don't go around
abducting children.

13:14.862 --> 13:17.030
Now, what I do
is perfectly legitimate.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.165
Why the stunt driving
when we show up.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.000
Because you people think
I'm doing something illegal.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.334
I don't kidnap kids!

13:21.368 --> 13:23.036
That's right,
you "rescue" them

13:23.070 --> 13:24.004
from custody cases.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.906
Only this time,
you went after the wrong kid.

13:25.939 --> 13:26.940
No. No, I didn't.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.041
You sure about that?

13:28.075 --> 13:29.076
Absolutely.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.343
You better think again!

13:30.377 --> 13:32.545
I don't have to.
The information is solid.

13:32.579 --> 13:33.646
Well, then, let me
give you the 4-1-1.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.883
Patty Branson's parents
have never been divorced.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.951
I know.
This is not a custody case.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.953
I never said it was.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.288
Captain.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.522
(Kenny)
What's this--
the heavy artillery?

13:42.555 --> 13:44.591
or are you guys getting
bigfooted by the boss?

13:44.624 --> 13:47.527
New York State is ready
to pull your P.I. ticket.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.962
That happens,
and Arizona finds out,

13:48.996 --> 13:50.563
you're washed up.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.199
(Fin)
Hope you got
another skill, Kenny.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.200
You're bluffing.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.169
You willing
to take that risk?

14:01.274 --> 14:02.275
Pete's the brains.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.177
I get close to the kids
because I look young.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.112
(Fin)
What's the job?

14:05.145 --> 14:07.447
To return that girl
to her real mother.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.049
So Patty Branson
was already kidnapped?

14:09.082 --> 14:10.450
Yeah.

14:10.483 --> 14:11.551
Matt and Sarah Branson
aren't really her parents?

14:11.584 --> 14:13.120
That's right.
That's crap.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.187
No, that's the truth.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.589
My client's daughter
disappeared four years ago.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.026
These clients of yours,
did they ever call the cops?

14:19.059 --> 14:21.028
Sure--of course, you people
didn't do squat.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.096
Well, I assume
that an expert like yourself

14:23.130 --> 14:24.464
would ask
for some kind of proof.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.033
I have the police reports,

14:26.066 --> 14:27.634
pictures of my client's daughter
and Patty.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.337
Same hair,
same facial features.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.073
Both kids diabetic.
They're the same girl.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.474
And you couldn't
have made a mistake?

14:34.507 --> 14:35.508
No!

14:35.542 --> 14:36.643
Well, this
is what we know,

14:36.676 --> 14:39.146
unless you tell us who hired you
to kidnap Patty Branson.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.248
The only thing
you're gonna do is time.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.152
[doorbell rings]

14:49.222 --> 14:50.690
(Benson)
Michele Osborne?
Yes?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.525
Police.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.628
You must be here
about my daughter.

14:57.965 --> 15:00.700
This is the last picture
of Anna before I lost her.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.568
She was two.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.937
And this is what
she would look like now.

15:03.971 --> 15:06.006
Who did this?

15:06.039 --> 15:08.575
Peter Carson, my P.I.,
has a forensic artist

15:08.608 --> 15:12.512
who specializes in
age progression photography.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.949
You know it's Anna,
don't you?

15:15.983 --> 15:18.451
That little girl in the park
is my baby.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.087
Actually, Mrs. Osborne,
we checked.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.957
NYPD has no record of Anna
as missing or abducted.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.693
The New Jersey
State Police do.

15:26.726 --> 15:30.063
And how did this abduction
happen?

15:30.097 --> 15:32.132
Anna and my husband Steve

15:32.165 --> 15:33.700
were on their way
to visit Steve's parents

15:33.733 --> 15:35.302
in Morristown.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.704
She was taken from a rest area
on the turnpike.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.372
Can we talk to Steve?

15:39.406 --> 15:42.242
He was killed
in a car accident.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.311
How did you find
Patty Branson?

15:44.344 --> 15:46.679
I saw her
at the playground

15:46.713 --> 15:47.714
about three weeks ago.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.749
I...

15:49.782 --> 15:51.451
I used to take Anna there,

15:51.484 --> 15:54.687
and so I go sometimes
to see the kids.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.560
You know, every day
I have prayed

16:00.593 --> 16:02.262
that I'd find Anna.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.697
Everywhere I go,
I look for her.

16:04.731 --> 16:08.301
I'd see a little girl
with Anna's smile

16:08.335 --> 16:09.602
or Anna's hair,

16:09.636 --> 16:11.238
and I'd hold my breath.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.141
It would never be her.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.308
Until the second

16:15.342 --> 16:18.011
I saw that little girl
on the swing.

16:18.045 --> 16:21.014
My heart stopped.

16:21.048 --> 16:24.684
I knew I had found my baby.

16:24.717 --> 16:25.785
With all due respect,
Mrs. Osborne,

16:25.818 --> 16:27.554
a feeling
is not enough.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.723
A mother knows her baby.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.459
A mother always knows.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.627
(Benson)
What did you do
when you saw Patty?

16:34.661 --> 16:37.797
I called the police.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.632
You people
thought I was crazy.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.601
So you hired Peter Carson.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.704
He was the only one
who believed me.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.208
And you don't.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.077
[scoffs]

16:50.110 --> 16:52.745
Let me show you something.

16:56.816 --> 17:00.253
I always knew Anna
would come back to me.

17:00.287 --> 17:03.190
She's a big girl now,
but I'm ready for her.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.664
Mrs. Osborne, um...

17:11.698 --> 17:13.400
I know you think
you have proof

17:13.433 --> 17:14.601
that Patty
is your daughter--

17:14.634 --> 17:16.203
I know that it's
hard for you to believe,

17:16.236 --> 17:18.705
but you've seen the pictures,
and Anna is a diabetic,

17:18.738 --> 17:20.473
just like the little girl
at the park.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.209
A coincidence
doesn't give you the right

17:22.242 --> 17:23.643
to hire someone
to take her.

17:23.676 --> 17:24.577
Mrs. Osborne,

17:24.611 --> 17:26.646
we're gonna have
to place you under arrest.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.382
For what?

17:29.416 --> 17:32.319
Conspiracy
to commit kidnapping.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.488
Go ahead.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.624
You'll see I'm right.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.630
(Judge Larson)
How do your clients plead?

17:43.663 --> 17:45.798
Not guilty.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.500
Not guilty.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.801
Not guilty.

17:48.835 --> 17:49.736
(Judge Larson)
Ms. Novak.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.438
The people request
high bail, your honor.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.773
The defendants conspired
to stalk and kidnap

17:53.806 --> 17:55.175
a six-year-old girl.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.876
She's my daughter!

17:56.909 --> 17:58.111
(Judge Larson)
That's not a matter
for this court, Mrs. Osborne.

17:58.145 --> 18:00.247
Ms. Emmett, no more outbursts
from your client.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.781
Yes, judge.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.650
The people also request
an order of protection.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.685
(Judge Larson)
Granted.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.787
Should you make bail, you are
not to come within 100 feet

18:07.820 --> 18:09.789
of the minor
Patricia Branson,

18:09.822 --> 18:11.158
her parents, their home,

18:11.191 --> 18:12.725
or the girl's school.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.728
If you violate this order,
you'll be arrested and charged.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.231
Are we clear?

18:18.265 --> 18:20.733
$500,000 each defendant.
Ten minute recess.

18:25.805 --> 18:26.773
I'm worried.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.808
Did you get anything
off Michele?

18:28.841 --> 18:29.842
Her outburst tells me

18:29.876 --> 18:31.878
that she doesn't think
taking Patty was wrong.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.346
So she is crazy.

18:33.380 --> 18:36.716
No. Michele's having
a single, fixed delusion.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.585
She knows kidnapping
is against the law,

18:38.618 --> 18:41.221
but she's so convinced
that Patty is her daughter

18:41.254 --> 18:43.656
that, in her mind,
taking her isn't a crime.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.825
It doesn't mean that she's
not mentally ill.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.495
Then if she
plead insanity?

18:48.528 --> 18:49.862
She'd lose.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.499
Something else
is bugging you.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.834
It's what you told me

18:54.867 --> 18:56.536
about how Michele
keeps Anna's room.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.871
That it's ready
for a six-year-old.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.241
Most missing children's rooms
become shrines,

19:01.274 --> 19:02.309
frozen in time

19:02.342 --> 19:03.810
from the moment
the child vanished.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.712
Michele
updating Anna's room

19:05.745 --> 19:09.449
tells me that she's confident
that Anna's coming home.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.917
You mean even if she
has to steal another Anna

19:10.950 --> 19:12.485
to make it so.

19:12.519 --> 19:16.889
What do we know
about Michele's past?

19:16.923 --> 19:19.492
She's clean.
There's nothing suspicious.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.793
Even her credit's perfect.

19:20.827 --> 19:21.661
And the girls?

19:21.694 --> 19:23.763
Well, I got two
birth certificates here.

19:23.796 --> 19:27.834
Patty Branson was born
August, 1998 in Mount Sinai.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.203
And Anna Osborne arrived
two weeks earlier,

19:30.237 --> 19:31.871
100 miles away
in Hartford.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.706
So they weren't
switched at birth.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.908
State troopers should have
entered Anna's information

19:35.942 --> 19:37.610
into the Missing Children's
Center database.

19:37.644 --> 19:38.745
What, it's not there?

19:38.778 --> 19:40.613
If it is,
I can't find it.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.415
Well, there's gotta be someplace
else you can look, right?

19:42.449 --> 19:43.716
FBI computer.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.285
I'll enter her name
into our search engine.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.753
[cell phone rings]

19:46.786 --> 19:48.788
Benson.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.458
Where?
Thanks.

19:51.491 --> 19:52.992
Olivia.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.494
You were right.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.597
Michele just violated
the protection order.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.931
Did you find Anna?

19:58.965 --> 20:02.869
Yes, but she
wasn't kidnapped.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.204
She's dead.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.241
Call came via 911.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.009
Woman ringing some resident's
buzzer repeatedly,

20:10.042 --> 20:11.911
yelling something about
she had proof.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.813
Wouldn't tell us
for what.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.282
You're making a mistake.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.616
No, Michele.

20:16.649 --> 20:17.984
The judge warned you,
and you wouldn't listen.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.652
Get out of here!
Get away from us!

20:19.686 --> 20:21.454
Why can't you
leave us alone?!

20:21.488 --> 20:22.622
She's my daughter!

20:22.655 --> 20:23.790
I gave birth to her!

20:23.823 --> 20:25.358
(Matt)
Honey,
the police are here.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.626
She's not gonna
bother you anymore

20:26.659 --> 20:27.960
because Michele
is going to jail.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.529
She is wrong.

20:31.431 --> 20:34.267
Michele, this has got
to stop now.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.002
Okay, we know everything.

20:36.035 --> 20:38.905
Anna was on the police report
from your husband's accident.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.973
She died in the car
with him.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.542
No. They never
found her remains.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.577
Michele, they were hit
by a gasoline tanker.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.313
Now, there
was nothing left.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.980
I'm sorry.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.450
But you know what
I'm telling you is the truth.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.852
I know my daughter
is alive!

20:54.787 --> 20:55.888
(Stabler)
Olivia!

20:55.922 --> 20:58.591
Yo, look
what I found.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.593
This guy
doesn't give up.

21:00.627 --> 21:01.728
(Benson)
Where'd you find him?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.062
Around the corner.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.299
That's not too smart, Pete.
Your bail's history.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.534
Piece of paper
in my pocket.

21:07.567 --> 21:08.968
Read it and weep.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.907
(Benson)
What is it?

21:14.941 --> 21:18.411
It's a lab report.

21:18.445 --> 21:21.348
Well, they tested the hair
from Patty Branson for DNA.

21:21.381 --> 21:22.615
So what does it say?

21:24.551 --> 21:27.587
Patty's
Michele Osborne's daughter.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.894
Patty's our child.

21:34.927 --> 21:37.564
I have the scar
from the C-section.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.766
There's home video
of her delivery.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.502
Uh, why are we having to prove
that our child is ours?

21:42.535 --> 21:45.705
We just need both of you
to take a DNA test.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.707
We'll do anything you want,
but, please.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.076
You have to believe us.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.011
Sorry to interrupt.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.980
Detectives.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.682
It's urgent.

21:59.686 --> 22:01.721
What's so urgent?

22:01.754 --> 22:04.357
I just found out that
Patty Branson and Dana Osborne

22:04.391 --> 22:05.958
are not the same child.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.760
How do you know?

22:07.794 --> 22:10.663
I ran another test
on a lock of Anna's hair

22:10.697 --> 22:12.131
that Michele gave me.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.834
Patty and Anna
don't have identical DNA,

22:14.867 --> 22:17.570
but their mitochondrial DNA
is the same.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.872
And mitochondrial DNA
is only passed from the mother.

22:19.906 --> 22:20.973
Yes.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.042
That makes Patty and Anna
sisters.

22:23.075 --> 22:24.744
How is that possible?

22:24.777 --> 22:27.380
I checked Anna Osborne's
birth records.

22:27.414 --> 22:30.016
Anna was conceived
through in vitro fertilization.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.151
So was Patty Branson.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.820
So you think
some fertility doctor

22:33.853 --> 22:34.887
made a mistake

22:34.921 --> 22:36.956
and put the Osborne's embryo
into Sarah Branson.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.726
It's the only way
to explain any of this.

22:39.759 --> 22:43.663
And I need
that doctor's name.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.365
Dr. Stanley Norton.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.770
He was my doctor, too.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.605
Both women
had the same doctor.

22:52.639 --> 22:55.575
Both girls born
within weeks of each other.

22:55.608 --> 23:01.881
Somehow, Sarah
got Michele's embryos.

23:01.914 --> 23:04.951
Oh, my God.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.686
How could this
have happened?

23:06.719 --> 23:08.555
Dr. Warner says
it could be as simple

23:08.588 --> 23:09.922
as somebody mislabeling
a petri dish.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.505
I'm so sorry

23:25.538 --> 23:27.106
for what I did.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.089
Ms. Novak,
is it possible

23:43.122 --> 23:46.526
to have the order
of protection removed?

23:50.096 --> 23:52.031
We don't want
Mrs. Osborne to suffer

23:52.064 --> 23:54.133
any more
than she already has.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.735
You can petition the judge

23:55.768 --> 23:57.069
if that's what you want.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.137
I'd like you to reconsider

23:58.170 --> 24:00.873
the attempted kidnap charge.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.209
Your client was ordered
to stay away from Patty Branson,

24:03.242 --> 24:05.678
and she ignored
that order.

24:05.712 --> 24:07.547
She broke the law.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.749
I have
to take her to trial.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.261
Casey, you gotta
plead her out.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.163
Why would I do that?

24:24.196 --> 24:26.533
Because what happened
was a mistake.

24:26.566 --> 24:27.734
Michele
is uncontrollably driven

24:27.767 --> 24:29.736
to kidnap someone else's
little girl.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.604
Her little girl,
biologically!

24:31.638 --> 24:32.905
But not legally.

24:32.939 --> 24:33.973
I can't let Michele
off the hook

24:34.006 --> 24:36.809
just because you feel guilty
you didn't believe her.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.177
Well, then,
give her a break,

24:38.210 --> 24:40.012
because she's also
a victim.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.782
What that fertility doctor
did to those two women

24:42.815 --> 24:44.751
is genetic rape.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.118
And don't tell me that
that doesn't bother you

24:46.152 --> 24:49.522
on some level.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.157
Talk to the doctor.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.859
Confirm what Michele
and the Bransons say,

24:52.892 --> 24:54.026
and I'll consider a deal.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.601
(Dr. Norton)
Sarah and Michele
both sent me pictures

25:01.634 --> 25:03.770
of their little girls
when they were born.

25:03.803 --> 25:04.837
Horrible what happened

25:04.871 --> 25:06.639
to Michele's
daughter and husband.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.608
So you remember them?

25:08.641 --> 25:09.976
I remember all
of my success stories.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.178
I wouldn't exactly
call them that.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.246
Two previously
childless couples

25:14.280 --> 25:16.749
gave birth
to beautiful kids.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.150
What would you call them?

25:18.184 --> 25:19.285
Sisters.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.288
Excuse me?

25:22.321 --> 25:23.389
You heard me.

25:23.422 --> 25:24.523
The medical examiner
tested their DNA.

25:24.557 --> 25:28.160
Anna Osborne and Patty Branson
both have the same mother:

25:28.194 --> 25:29.295
Michele Osborne.

25:29.328 --> 25:32.131
That could never
have happened here.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.834
It did, and we need you
to tell us how.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.069
I don't know how.
We have safeguards in place.

25:37.103 --> 25:39.906
Apparently someone
screwed up and made a mistake.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.841
The only explanation
I can think of

25:41.874 --> 25:43.710
is that Michele Osborne

25:43.743 --> 25:44.811
must have donated
her unused embryos.

25:44.844 --> 25:46.345
And how
would she do that?

25:46.378 --> 25:48.247
Michele would have
filled out a form,

25:48.280 --> 25:50.049
signed it,
countersigned by a witness.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.317
Well, if we can
see that form,

25:51.350 --> 25:53.786
we can clear this up
quickly.

25:55.855 --> 25:59.792
I'll have a file clerk
make a copy for you.

25:59.826 --> 26:00.793
I don't believe this.

26:00.827 --> 26:03.195
This is my signature,
but I never consented

26:03.229 --> 26:05.331
to donating my embryos.

26:05.364 --> 26:07.634
Then why
did you sign it?

26:07.667 --> 26:08.701
Because I consented
to ICSI.

26:08.735 --> 26:09.936
What's that?

26:09.969 --> 26:11.671
Intra-Cytoplasmic
Sperm Injection,

26:11.704 --> 26:14.707
where they injected
Steve's sperm into my eggs.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.776
See?
It's on the same form.

26:16.809 --> 26:20.179
I checked the ICSI box,
but not the donation box.

26:20.212 --> 26:21.948
Michele,
this was seven years ago.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.850
You sure about this?

26:23.883 --> 26:24.784
Of course, I'm sure.

26:24.817 --> 26:27.086
Dr. Norton asked us,
and Steve and I said

26:27.119 --> 26:30.790
that we didn't want
someone else having our child.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.659
What happened
to your extra embryos?

26:32.692 --> 26:33.960
Dr. Norton said
there weren't any.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.095
I had six eggs,
four of them fertilized.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.064
He put them all
back into me.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.299
He obviously
lied about that.

26:40.332 --> 26:43.670
And he's lying
about this form.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.941
Both Xs look the same to me.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.843
It's a legal document.
Forgery's a crime.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.879
You don't know
that doctor forged anything.

26:52.912 --> 26:54.213
Look, maybe
it's buyer's remorse:

26:54.246 --> 26:56.716
Michele did consent
to donate her embryos,

26:56.749 --> 26:57.750
and now she's sorry
she did.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.719
That doctor pulled that story
out of his ass.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.020
Come on, Elliot.

27:01.053 --> 27:03.022
He was making it up
as he was telling it to us.

27:03.055 --> 27:03.956
So you think he's lying?

27:03.990 --> 27:05.892
Michele Osborne
hired private detectives

27:05.925 --> 27:06.793
to kidnap a child.

27:06.826 --> 27:07.960
Why do you believe her?

27:07.994 --> 27:09.361
Because Michele Osborne
has never lied to us

27:09.395 --> 27:10.663
about anything.

27:10.697 --> 27:12.164
Patty is
her biological daughter.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.866
So let Michele
and the Bransons

27:13.900 --> 27:15.134
sue Norton
for malpractice.

27:15.167 --> 27:16.736
But if he intentionally

27:16.769 --> 27:18.337
put one woman's eggs
into another without consent,

27:18.370 --> 27:19.906
we can't just
let him get away with it.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.741
(Novak)
There's no law against that
in New York State.

27:21.774 --> 27:22.909
And we can't
charge him with larceny

27:22.942 --> 27:24.744
because stolen property
has to have value,

27:24.777 --> 27:26.078
and body parts don't.

27:26.112 --> 27:27.714
In vitro fertilization

27:27.747 --> 27:29.248
costs tens of thousands
of dollars a pop.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.751
If Norton misrepresented
what he did

27:31.784 --> 27:33.886
and put that "X"
on this form,

27:33.920 --> 27:35.822
then we have him
on fraud and forgery.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.356
If he did it once before,

27:37.389 --> 27:39.859
you can bet that he's done
the same thing to other women.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.460
Now all we have to do
is prove it.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.362
Right.
This consent form is a copy.

27:43.395 --> 27:46.132
You get us a warrant
for the original, and we will.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.137
(Fisher)
Well, we verified
Michele Osborne's signature

27:51.170 --> 27:52.939
on the form
as authentic,

27:52.972 --> 27:54.907
but the Xs
are a different story.

27:54.941 --> 27:56.142
Take a look.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.844
Now, the one on the left

27:57.877 --> 27:59.345
is from the ICSI box
on the form.

27:59.378 --> 28:00.847
The other is for donation.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.815
Both have traces
of formamide in the ink,

28:02.849 --> 28:04.316
which
pen manufacturers use

28:04.350 --> 28:05.885
to keep ball points
from drying up.

28:05.918 --> 28:06.986
But they don't
look the same.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.088
Yeah.
See the striations?

28:09.121 --> 28:11.123
See, ballpoint pen ink
is extremely viscous.

28:11.157 --> 28:13.259
It sits on top
of the paper.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.927
But look at the "X"
on the right.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.195
(Fin)
No striations.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.964
And the ink's been
absorbed into the paper.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.799
So the "X" was written
with a different pen?

28:19.832 --> 28:20.800
Well, not just
a different pen,

28:20.833 --> 28:22.101
a gel writer.

28:22.134 --> 28:24.036
(Fin)
Those things are
all over the place.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.338
Except this manufacturer's
only been making them

28:26.372 --> 28:28.074
for five years.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.742
Michele signed that form
seven years ago,

28:29.776 --> 28:30.977
even before
she got pregnant.

28:31.010 --> 28:34.380
Which means our Dr. Baby Maker's
a big, fat liar.

28:34.413 --> 28:35.447
I did nothing wrong!

28:35.481 --> 28:38.484
Say nothing else,
Stanley.

28:38.517 --> 28:41.353
My client made an error
in judgment.

28:41.387 --> 28:42.454
That's an understatement.

28:42.488 --> 28:45.024
Michele Osborne
gave my client

28:45.057 --> 28:47.126
verbal permission
to donate her embryos

28:47.159 --> 28:48.861
seven years ago.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.430
Dr. Norton marked
the " X" on the form

28:51.463 --> 28:53.199
because he thought
it would help her remember.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.333
Oh, she remembers
all right.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.235
She remembers
that she never consented.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.037
(Attorney)
And you believe her?

28:58.070 --> 28:59.839
After she tried to have
a little girl kidnapped?

28:59.872 --> 29:01.440
Because of what Dr. Norton
did to her,

29:01.473 --> 29:03.375
so we're
dropping those charges.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.911
(Attorney)
Well, it's still
Michele's word

29:04.944 --> 29:06.178
against my client's.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.513
(Novak)
And his own employees.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.381
We have signed,
sworn statements

29:09.415 --> 29:11.250
saying that you routinely

29:11.283 --> 29:13.986
implant one woman's
genetic material into another!

29:14.020 --> 29:15.955
All I have ever done

29:15.988 --> 29:17.489
is help infertile couples
have children.

29:17.523 --> 29:20.459
All you've ever done
is pad your bank account.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.462
And you can be sure
we'll find out

29:23.495 --> 29:24.563
how many other women
he's victimized.

29:24.596 --> 29:25.898
How?

29:25.932 --> 29:27.099
You can't subpoena
my client's

29:27.133 --> 29:28.334
privileged
patient records.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.569
Unless there's evidence
of an ongoing

29:30.602 --> 29:32.471
criminal conspiracy.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.941
That forged "X"
on the consent form

29:34.974 --> 29:38.210
is all the ammunition I need
to go before a judge.

29:42.448 --> 29:43.950
We scored a clean sweep.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.151
Yeah?
What did we get?

29:45.184 --> 29:46.418
Warrants and subpoenas
for the records

29:46.452 --> 29:48.520
of all of Dr. Norton's
in vitro patients,

29:48.554 --> 29:51.223
plus, all surgical
and cryopreservation logs.

29:51.257 --> 29:52.591
Cryo what?

29:52.624 --> 29:54.026
Where egg,
sperm, and embryos

29:54.060 --> 29:55.027
are frozen and stored.

29:55.061 --> 29:57.229
Any of this make an impression
on Dr. Norton?

29:57.263 --> 30:00.566
No, that guy still thinks
he did a favor for the Bransons.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.601
Anyway,
Sarah's medical records

30:02.634 --> 30:04.837
have a notation that
none of her eggs fertilized.

30:04.871 --> 30:05.872
So Norton
just slipped her

30:05.905 --> 30:07.106
one of Michele Osborne's
embryos

30:07.139 --> 30:08.040
to keep up
his batting average.

30:08.074 --> 30:09.175
What a guy.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.443
Okay, so we get him
on a couple of counts of fraud,

30:11.477 --> 30:13.846
he loses his license,
and he does some time.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.114
Two-two precinct
just called.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.448
They're mobilized.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.549
For what?

30:17.583 --> 30:20.552
Patty.

30:20.586 --> 30:22.188
I don't know
how it happened.

30:22.221 --> 30:24.023
I counted the children
before we left the building.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.224
Patty was in line.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.059
When did you notice
she was missing?

30:27.093 --> 30:28.227
When I counted again
on the bus,

30:28.260 --> 30:29.261
Patty wasn't there.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.129
You see anyone

30:30.162 --> 30:32.064
following your class
into to the museum?

30:32.098 --> 30:33.933
No.
I don't know.

30:33.966 --> 30:36.002
I--I was too busy
keeping an eye on the kids.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.070
Hey, checked
the whole building.

30:38.104 --> 30:39.205
Nothing.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.073
What about this woman?

30:41.107 --> 30:42.641
Oh, God.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.611
She was at the door
when the class was leaving.

30:50.917 --> 30:51.783
Anything?

30:51.817 --> 30:54.520
Beds made,
drawers and closets are full.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.388
Doesn't look like
Michele packed in a hurry.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.290
The suitcases in here
are covered with cobwebs.

30:58.324 --> 30:59.658
Haven't been touched
in a while.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.293
She knew that this
is the first place we'd look.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.562
She grabbed Patty, took off,
and left everything behind.

31:03.595 --> 31:04.931
Not easy for a mother

31:04.964 --> 31:05.965
to turn off a natural bond
with her child.

31:05.998 --> 31:07.900
It does look like
they had a place at the beach.

31:07.934 --> 31:09.235
I found a picture
like this upstairs

31:09.268 --> 31:11.003
from before
they had the baby.

31:11.037 --> 31:11.971
Michele picked up her car

31:12.004 --> 31:13.405
from the garage
down the street this morning.

31:13.439 --> 31:14.573
Attendant say
where they were going?

31:14.606 --> 31:15.607
Yeah--Queens.

31:15.641 --> 31:16.442
Why Queens?

31:16.475 --> 31:17.944
Says she goes there
every weekend.

31:17.977 --> 31:21.347
To her beach house.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.648
Belle Harbor.

31:32.491 --> 31:33.692
You can't take her.
She's my daughter.

31:33.725 --> 31:34.693
(Benson)
No, she's not!

31:34.726 --> 31:35.962
She belongs to me!

31:35.995 --> 31:37.096
Put your hands
behind your back.

31:37.129 --> 31:39.932
I never gave Dr. Norton
permission to take my eggs!

31:39.966 --> 31:42.001
Michele Osborne, you're
under arrest for kidnapping.

31:42.034 --> 31:45.271
Please don't do this.
Where's Patty?

31:45.304 --> 31:46.705
It doesn't matter
who gave birth to her.

31:46.738 --> 31:47.706
You know she's mine.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.475
Michele,
she's six years old,

31:49.508 --> 31:51.410
and I'm taking her home.
Now, where is she?

31:57.549 --> 32:00.019
Patty?
In here.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.123
Olivia!

32:04.156 --> 32:07.526
Are you okay,
Patty?

32:07.559 --> 32:09.295
I don't wanna
stay here.

32:09.328 --> 32:10.729
You don't have to,
sweetie.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.432
I came to take you back
to your mommy and your daddy.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.501
They still want me?

32:15.534 --> 32:16.635
Of course they do, honey.

32:16.668 --> 32:18.170
Why would you think
they don't?

32:18.204 --> 32:22.008
Because Michele said
she's my real mommy.

32:22.041 --> 32:25.077
It's not true,
is it, Olivia?

32:25.111 --> 32:26.512
Is it?

32:28.347 --> 32:31.017
Come here, sweetie.

32:31.050 --> 32:34.453
Let's get you back
to your mommy and daddy, okay?

32:37.223 --> 32:38.724
Patty! Oh!
Patty! Baby!

32:38.757 --> 32:41.660
Mommy!

32:41.693 --> 32:44.496
I missed you, Patty.

32:44.530 --> 32:48.400
You can't let Michele Osborne
come near us again.

32:48.434 --> 32:49.701
Michele is being arraigned
right now.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.038
ADA Novak is going to make sure
that she's held without bail.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.173
That's not gonna stop her.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.607
The judge is gonna
keep her in jail.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.609
Until she gets out
and comes back.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.278
And comes back again.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.013
Nothing is gonna
stop this woman.

33:01.047 --> 33:03.249
She's never
gonna give up!

33:06.318 --> 33:07.553
Can't kidnap
your own daughter.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.121
The law says
she isn't yours.

33:09.155 --> 33:10.289
Well, the law is wrong!

33:10.322 --> 33:11.457
Well, we should just
forget about the law

33:11.490 --> 33:12.791
and focus
on what's right.

33:12.824 --> 33:13.692
What's right
is for your client

33:13.725 --> 33:16.028
to accept that she
has no claim to Patty.

33:16.062 --> 33:18.030
I can't do that.
I'm Patty's mother.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.431
You're a victim,
Michele.

33:19.465 --> 33:20.732
We'll take that
into consideration.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.368
How much
consideration?

33:22.401 --> 33:23.802
We're still willing
to make an offer.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.537
Michele will have to serve
three to five years

33:25.571 --> 33:27.073
and get counseling.

33:27.106 --> 33:28.707
No, thank you.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.810
If you go to trial
and get convicted,

33:31.843 --> 33:35.114
you're looking
at 15 years in prison.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.415
I'll be acquitted,

33:36.448 --> 33:38.517
and then I'll sue
for custody of Patty.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.452
You kidding me?

33:40.486 --> 33:42.288
This isn't your idea, is it?

33:42.321 --> 33:43.822
The jury has plenty of evidence
to convict Michele,

33:43.855 --> 33:45.457
so if they find her
not guilty,

33:45.491 --> 33:48.127
it's because they've decided
Patty is her child.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.428
That's not binding
on any other court,

33:49.461 --> 33:50.362
and you know it.

33:50.396 --> 33:52.264
We can use it to argue
the next logical step,

33:52.298 --> 33:54.800
which is to award Michele
custody of Patty,

33:54.833 --> 33:56.402
and get a judge
to hear the case.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.104
It'll never work.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.338
I have to try.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.273
You can't.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.777
Why did you
bring her here?

34:05.811 --> 34:07.579
Because she wanted
to come.

34:07.613 --> 34:10.816
I know you
lost your daughter.

34:10.849 --> 34:14.086
But can't you see
what you're doing to Patty?

34:14.120 --> 34:17.656
She's my flesh.
And blood.

34:17.689 --> 34:20.292
But she came
from inside me.

34:20.326 --> 34:23.462
She kicked in my belly.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.764
She nursed from my breast.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.833
She has my genes.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.401
And my husband's genes.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.203
Because of a mistake!

34:31.237 --> 34:33.305
It wasn't a mistake.

34:33.339 --> 34:36.642
My daughter died.

34:36.675 --> 34:40.312
And now God has given me
a second chance.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.648
Please.

34:44.516 --> 34:45.817
Please.

34:48.454 --> 34:52.858
A mother wouldn't do this
to any child.

34:52.891 --> 34:56.395
A mother would
fight for her child.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.464
I'm sorry.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.799
But I'm not
gonna give up...

35:00.832 --> 35:02.468
until that jury
looks me in the eye

35:02.501 --> 35:06.838
and tells me that I am guilty
of stealing my own child.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.847
(Novak)
No one here
will try and tell you

35:15.881 --> 35:19.185
that Michele Osborne
is violent or evil.

35:19.218 --> 35:22.154
She was driven to kidnap
Patty Branson

35:22.188 --> 35:25.391
because she believes
Patty is her little girl.

35:25.424 --> 35:28.860
And, biologically,
Patty is her daughter.

35:28.894 --> 35:32.164
But you must remember
the law says

35:32.198 --> 35:34.500
the birth mother
is the child's mother,

35:34.533 --> 35:36.535
so Patty is not
and can never

35:36.568 --> 35:39.805
legally be
Michele's daughter.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.840
Now, Michele
kidnapped Patty

35:41.873 --> 35:43.675
from the mother
who gave her life,

35:43.709 --> 35:46.378
and from the parents
who've raised her since birth.

35:46.412 --> 35:48.347
So no matter how much
you may be moved

35:48.380 --> 35:49.915
by Michele Osborne's pain,

35:49.948 --> 35:52.184
you cannot ignore the fact

35:52.218 --> 35:55.554
she broke the law.

36:01.993 --> 36:05.497
The moment that Michele Osborne
laid eyes on Patty Branson

36:05.531 --> 36:08.234
at a playground
in Riverside Park,

36:08.267 --> 36:11.437
she felt drawn to her.

36:11.470 --> 36:16.942
A powerful, uncontrollable,
biological attachment to her.

36:16.975 --> 36:20.512
She knew Patty
was her child.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.948
And DNA
proves she was right.

36:22.981 --> 36:25.451
That maternal instinct
brought out the truth

36:25.484 --> 36:28.820
that Michele and Patty's
birth parents are all victims

36:28.854 --> 36:31.457
of an unscrupulous
fertility doctor

36:31.490 --> 36:33.892
who stole an embryo
from Michele

36:33.925 --> 36:35.927
and then planted it
in Sarah Branson

36:35.961 --> 36:37.829
without anyone's consent.

36:37.863 --> 36:42.334
Now, to find Michele Osborne
guilty of kidnapping,

36:42.368 --> 36:45.271
the people must prove
that she had intent

36:45.304 --> 36:47.473
to commit a crime.

36:47.506 --> 36:50.976
So, as you hear evidence,
you must consider:

36:51.009 --> 36:54.713
Did Michele Osborne
intend to break the law?

36:54.746 --> 36:59.551
Or was she driven
by a more powerful law--

36:59.585 --> 37:02.020
The law of nature?

37:02.053 --> 37:05.891
The love of a mother
for her child.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.868
Pass it, Dickie!
Pass it!

37:19.438 --> 37:21.473
Dad, I was wide open.

37:21.507 --> 37:22.974
Why didn't you
give the shot to your sister?

37:23.008 --> 37:24.042
Elizabeth can't shoot
as good as I do.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.677
But you didn't
have the shot.

37:25.711 --> 37:26.878
She did.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.815
If you would have passed it,
I would have scored, dope-o.

37:29.848 --> 37:32.484
Who's that lady
staring at us, dad?

37:32.518 --> 37:33.752
(Stabler)
Afternoon.

37:33.785 --> 37:36.322
Yeah, your wife
said I could find you here.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.624
Dickie, Elizabeth,
this is Ms. Novak.

37:38.657 --> 37:39.825
We work together.

37:39.858 --> 37:42.594
You guys look like
a couple of pros out there.

37:42.628 --> 37:44.430
Yeah, so go practice.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.732
And you don't
hog the ball.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.835
Let me guess--you just
happened to find yourself

37:49.868 --> 37:51.503
in the ass end of Queens?

37:51.537 --> 37:53.004
Michele Osborne
trial prep.

37:53.038 --> 37:54.440
I need a reality check.

37:54.473 --> 37:56.007
Okay, for what?

37:56.041 --> 37:58.610
There's no way to win it.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.846
You've got her cold
on the evidence.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.614
Well, the defense
has already won the jury.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.416
Once they hear about
what happened to Michele,

38:04.450 --> 38:07.553
no one's gonna
care about evidence.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.521
Are you worried about
losing this case,

38:09.555 --> 38:11.523
or are you
having second thoughts?

38:13.392 --> 38:14.793
I don't think the law
can do anyone justice

38:14.826 --> 38:16.395
in this case.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.430
Are you just
figuring that out now?

38:21.533 --> 38:24.002
Michele gets convicted,
she goes to prison.

38:24.035 --> 38:27.339
If Michele gets acquitted,
she'll never let go of Patty,

38:27.373 --> 38:28.707
and there'll be
no end to this.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.776
Either way,
somebody loses.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.879
Right.
What's the question?

38:37.416 --> 38:40.352
If you found out
you had another kid out there,

38:40.386 --> 38:41.587
would you want it?

38:41.620 --> 38:43.922
You're damn right
I would.

38:43.955 --> 38:46.892
So you know why
she's so obsessed.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.660
It's not an obsession.
It's a love.

38:48.694 --> 38:49.761
It's a connection

38:49.795 --> 38:51.463
that transcends
everything and anything.

38:51.497 --> 38:53.965
It's--

38:53.999 --> 38:56.368
I would die
for my children.

38:56.402 --> 38:57.369
And there's
nothing in the world

38:57.403 --> 38:58.937
that would ever
change that.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.739
Ever.

39:02.408 --> 39:03.875
So Michele and Sarah

39:03.909 --> 39:06.745
will never stop
fighting over Patty.

39:09.047 --> 39:12.083
And King Solomon said,
"Bring me a sword.

39:12.117 --> 39:15.687
"Divide the living child
in two.

39:15.721 --> 39:18.123
Give half to the one
and half to the other."

39:18.156 --> 39:22.060
Except I can't
split the baby.

39:24.430 --> 39:27.433
Solomon didn't have to.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.644
(Novak)
Patty, do you see the person
who took you from the museum?

39:38.677 --> 39:39.745
Yes.

39:39.778 --> 39:42.448
She's over there.

39:42.481 --> 39:43.749
Let the record show

39:43.782 --> 39:45.817
that she's indicated

39:45.851 --> 39:48.119
the defendant, Michele Osborne.

39:50.622 --> 39:53.992
So why did you
go with her, Patty?

39:54.025 --> 39:56.995
She said she had
to take me to my mommy.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.064
Where did she take you?

39:59.097 --> 40:00.699
To her house.

40:00.732 --> 40:05.003
Mommy wasn't there.

40:05.036 --> 40:08.106
Did you ask her
where Mommy was?

40:08.139 --> 40:10.141
(Patty)
Yes.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.844
Michele said
she's my real mommy.

40:12.878 --> 40:15.814
My egg mommy.

40:15.847 --> 40:20.586
(Novak)
Did she tell you
what that means?

40:20.619 --> 40:23.154
She said I came out
of Mommy's tummy,

40:23.188 --> 40:27.759
but the egg that I came from
was from her tummy.

40:29.828 --> 40:32.698
What did you do while you were
at Michele's house, Patty?

40:32.731 --> 40:34.032
Watched TV.

40:34.065 --> 40:37.035
Played with toys.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.904
Do you think Michele
is nice?

40:40.872 --> 40:42.774
She's okay.

40:42.808 --> 40:45.844
You know what Michele said
about being your egg mommy

40:45.877 --> 40:47.212
is true, right?

40:50.549 --> 40:51.783
Your honor.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.821
Could you please
answer the question, Patty?

40:55.854 --> 41:00.025
No.
It's not true!

41:00.058 --> 41:01.760
Yes, it is, Patty.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.629
Michele's not my mommy!

41:03.662 --> 41:07.533
(Novak)
You came from her egg.
That is true.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.568
I want to go now.

41:09.601 --> 41:10.902
No, you can't
until we're finished.

41:10.936 --> 41:12.103
I don't want
to go with Michele!

41:12.137 --> 41:14.640
(Emmett)
Your honor, she's just
a little girl.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.074
(Judge Bradley)
Is this line of questioning
necessary?

41:16.107 --> 41:17.876
(Novak)
Patty, do you understand?

41:17.909 --> 41:19.845
I don't want
to go with Michele!

41:19.878 --> 41:22.280
You don't have to, Patty--
not yet.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.715
I want my mommy
and daddy.

41:23.749 --> 41:25.050
(Novak)
No, you have to stay here.

41:25.083 --> 41:26.652
Please!

41:26.685 --> 41:28.253
Don't take me away.

41:28.286 --> 41:29.821
Please.

41:29.855 --> 41:31.790
Stop it!
Just stop it!

41:31.823 --> 41:34.660
(Judge Bradley)
Sit down now, Ms. Osborne.

41:38.263 --> 41:40.566
Patty...

41:40.599 --> 41:41.833
I'm sorry.

41:45.804 --> 41:48.139
I won't ever
bother you again.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.713
Mommy! Mommy.

41:58.216 --> 42:01.820
I've changed my mind.
I just want this to stop.

42:01.853 --> 42:05.156
I'll plead guilty
if that's what it takes.

42:05.190 --> 42:08.059
Just leave Patty alone.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.740
Michele pled
to custodial interference.

42:21.773 --> 42:24.743
Suspended sentence.
Said she's moving out of state.

42:24.776 --> 42:27.846
It's too painful to be
near Patty and not see her.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.314
She did the motherly thing--

42:29.347 --> 42:31.583
loving her
by letting her go.

42:31.617 --> 42:33.051
Damage is already done.

42:33.084 --> 42:34.620
Patty's relationship
with her parents

42:34.653 --> 42:35.921
will never be the same

42:35.954 --> 42:37.155
now that everybody
knows the truth.

42:37.188 --> 42:40.959
Law has to catch up
with technology.

42:40.992 --> 42:42.961
Yeah, but both mothers
love that one child.

42:42.994 --> 42:44.930
How you gonna make a law
to deal with that?

42:44.963 --> 42:46.898
When Patty's 18,
she can make her own choice

42:46.932 --> 42:49.100
whether or not she wants
to contact Michele,

42:49.134 --> 42:51.036
like in an open adoption.

42:53.038 --> 42:55.607
I finished the audit
on Dr. Norton's clinic.

42:55.641 --> 42:56.908
And what's wrong?

42:56.942 --> 42:59.210
Michele didn't have
four embryos.

42:59.244 --> 43:01.046
She had sixteen,

43:01.079 --> 43:02.914
ten of which were
implanted in other women.

43:02.948 --> 43:05.984
How many live births?

43:06.017 --> 43:07.285
Besides Patty,
Michele has two daughters

43:07.318 --> 43:08.987
and a son out there somewhere.
