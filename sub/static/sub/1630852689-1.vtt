00:42.834 --> 00:43.960
Hello?

00:44.044 --> 00:45.754
<i>Hi, Paula.</i>

00:45.837 --> 00:47.756
<i>Today's the day.</i>

00:49.382 --> 00:52.761
I've already told you to get lost,
you son of a bitch!

01:14.324 --> 01:16.326
RESTAURANT

02:15.343 --> 02:16.344
Hello?

02:18.555 --> 02:19.889
Are you open?

02:20.598 --> 02:22.183
- Can I help you?

02:23.393 --> 02:25.228
I'd like a coffee, please.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.314
Drip or espresso?

02:29.482 --> 02:30.483
Drip.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.456
That fog's pretty intense,

02:46.041 --> 02:47.459
and you're soaking wet.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.795
I wouldn't head out right now.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.380
I'll drive really slowly.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.845
If I were your mother,
I wouldn't let you go.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.349
You don't know my mother.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.142
Thanks.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.776
Sorry, mister.

03:13.902 --> 03:14.903
Kitchen's closed.

03:33.922 --> 03:34.923
Water.

03:35.507 --> 03:36.800
Tap water.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.188
Sorry!

05:43.551 --> 05:45.720


05:45.804 --> 05:48.640
<i>Your call</i>

06:24.592 --> 06:26.136
What's the matter?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.387
It's Lúcia.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.181
Her phone's been off-line since yesterday.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.851
That's normal.
She'll show up soon enough.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.362
Relax, Paula.

06:44.946 --> 06:48.158
Lúcia went to college abroad
so that her mom would stop nagging her.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.161
Good morning.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.456
Good morning. It's this way.
Just climb the stairs at the end.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.044
I had a nightmare about her.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.254
Forget it. It's just a dream.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.506
I don't know. She was…

07:04.674 --> 07:05.675
It was horrible.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.760
FORENSICS

07:06.843 --> 07:09.262
- You fell asleep at work again?
- So what, Camila?

07:09.346 --> 07:13.183
If you sleep surrounded by dead bodies,
what else are you going to dream about?

07:17.854 --> 07:19.230
There's something else.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.107
What?

07:22.525 --> 07:23.902
Those strange calls.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.363
There was another one yesterday.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.323
Didn't you block that number?

07:28.406 --> 07:31.201
I did, but they called from another line.
They always do.

07:33.286 --> 07:37.123
Forget it. Let's head in and see
what kind of mess we're dealing with here.

08:13.118 --> 08:16.413
CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATOR

08:17.831 --> 08:18.832
Another newbie?

08:20.250 --> 08:21.251
Well?

08:21.751 --> 08:24.129
I think you'd better see for yourselves.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.412
Hmm.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.045
Look at this.

09:09.716 --> 09:10.800
Look here.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.655
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

09:40.622 --> 09:41.790
Holy shit…

09:46.252 --> 09:48.672
Creepy fucking place,
huh, Marques?

10:17.575 --> 10:18.868
Son of a bitch!

10:19.786 --> 10:21.246
What is it?

10:21.329 --> 10:23.164
She was alive when she was cut.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.918
- How do you know?
- There's scarring here. Look.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.965
Is this all of it?

10:34.050 --> 10:35.093
No.

10:36.803 --> 10:37.804
What?

10:45.228 --> 10:48.064
Open that up, Marques.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.649
Want to throw up?

10:58.074 --> 11:00.160
Holy fucking shit.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.705
Watch out.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.124
What a sicko.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.727
Any leads?

11:26.311 --> 11:27.437
Leads?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.647
We've already caught the psycho.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.692
He's out in the squad car,
thinking about what he's done.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.110
Anonymous tip.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.155
- He was passed out in here.
- Here?

11:37.238 --> 11:39.699
Tied up. Hit in the head.

11:39.783 --> 11:43.495
Someone must have knocked him down
and fled to avoid getting fucked up too.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.956
It doesn't make sense.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.629
Does anything make sense here?

11:52.712 --> 11:55.590
- Are you sure it was him?
- Blood on his hands,

11:55.674 --> 11:58.176
under his nails, on his face,
on his clothes.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.762
But you two still need to confirm it.

12:10.980 --> 12:11.981
Hello?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.401
Yes, it's me.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.786
Yes, I know where that is.

12:29.541 --> 12:30.542
Hey!

12:51.479 --> 12:52.731
Hey!

12:53.523 --> 12:54.899
Hey!

12:56.609 --> 12:59.320
Yo! What's wrong? Paula?

13:01.322 --> 13:03.033
- Paula! What's wrong?

13:04.325 --> 13:05.618
I have to go.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.746
Go where?
We haven't even started here yet.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.332
- What's the matter?
- It's Lúcia!

13:11.916 --> 13:14.127
Take care of this crap! I have to go.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.629
CANGALAN FARM

13:58.630 --> 13:59.881
Listen, Camila.

13:59.964 --> 14:03.051
I need these bodies analyzed
as soon as possible, okay?

14:03.134 --> 14:06.012
Okay. And I need a cigarette.
Do you have one?

14:11.017 --> 14:12.018
Here.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.604
I still have some gum.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.856
It has nicotine. Want one?

14:17.482 --> 14:19.109
I want to know about Paula.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.493
WELCOME TO WHITE MIST

15:12.495 --> 15:14.622
Handle that. It's the victim's mother.

15:14.706 --> 15:17.751
- Calm down, ma'am!

15:22.630 --> 15:24.966
I'm sorry, but you can't go any further.

16:19.396 --> 16:20.814
Paula?

16:24.442 --> 16:25.443
Paula?

16:27.821 --> 16:30.198
I'm Dr. César Schultz.

16:34.244 --> 16:39.290
I'm the director here at the White Mist
criminal psychiatric hospital.

16:39.374 --> 16:40.375
What's this?

16:41.376 --> 16:42.919
What's this? Let me go!

16:43.003 --> 16:45.255
Let me go. I need to get out of here!

16:46.256 --> 16:48.299
I'm afraid you can't do that yet.

16:48.883 --> 16:52.429
I need to see my daughter.
Let me out of here! Let me go!

16:52.512 --> 16:54.556
You've suffered intense trauma.

16:57.183 --> 17:00.520
<i>And you attacked police officers</i>
<i>extremely violently.</i>

17:05.400 --> 17:09.529
The police brought you here
because you endangered their lives.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.210
That's right.

17:37.599 --> 17:39.893
Are you aware of what happened?

17:53.865 --> 17:55.658
Your daughter died…

17:57.202 --> 17:58.411
in a car accident.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.046
<i>You had a severe breakdown.</i>

18:09.381 --> 18:10.423
<i>A dangerous one.</i>

18:25.480 --> 18:27.774
<i>We're taking care of you.</i>

18:32.612 --> 18:34.280
My daughter's not dead!

18:35.198 --> 18:37.617
My daughter's not dead!
Let me out of here!

18:38.535 --> 18:40.912
Let me out.
I need to see my daughter.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.956
I need to see-- I need to see--

18:44.457 --> 18:46.418
I need to see my daughter.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.381
Uh-uh.

18:52.382 --> 18:53.508
Take it.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.428
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
- It'll do you good.

18:57.220 --> 19:00.640
If you don't take this,
we can't let you go.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.394
Do you understand?

19:07.647 --> 19:09.024
It's for your own good.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.651
I'm on your side, Paula.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.707
- That's it.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.297
That's it…

19:49.314 --> 19:51.775
I'll go ask someone to let you go.

20:14.673 --> 20:16.591
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE
Manoel de Almeida

20:16.675 --> 20:18.093
Spanish consul.

20:26.685 --> 20:29.813
Before long,
we'll know whose bodies those were.

20:31.898 --> 20:35.985
There's a shitload of press out there.
There'll be articles about this all over.

20:38.029 --> 20:40.031
We have two options.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.035
Option one…

20:47.163 --> 20:49.624
you tell me why you did this

20:51.042 --> 20:53.253
and where the rest of the bodies are.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.173
You'll get screwed in jail,

20:58.133 --> 21:00.635
but we can make your life a little easier.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.931
You've got a few screws loose, don't you?

21:05.015 --> 21:06.141
Well, there you go.

21:07.100 --> 21:11.479
We'll whip up
some fucking insanity plea bullshit.

21:13.231 --> 21:15.775
In a few years, you'll be free.

21:17.068 --> 21:18.194
You'll go to Spain,

21:19.029 --> 21:23.408
eat paella, drink sangria,

21:24.200 --> 21:27.954
play with your grandson Juan Carlos
or whatever.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.124
Hmm?

21:35.128 --> 21:36.546
Option two…

21:38.757 --> 21:40.300
you make things difficult.

21:41.593 --> 21:44.554
You sit there quietly
and don't say one fucking thing.

21:45.096 --> 21:47.098
And then things will fucking suck.

21:48.224 --> 21:52.854
The press will want to eat you alive.
A lot of people will want a piece of you.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.273
You can forget about Spain.

21:55.357 --> 21:59.944
You can forget about paella,
forget about Juan Carlos.

22:01.988 --> 22:07.327
At most, you get that fucking prison food
that tastes like dried shit.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.622
For the rest of your life.

22:11.706 --> 22:12.707
How about it?

22:13.333 --> 22:14.876
Want to work with us here?

22:17.837 --> 22:19.923
<i>Your call is being forwarded…</i>

22:20.006 --> 22:22.676
Fucking hell, Paula.

22:36.314 --> 22:37.315
What?

22:38.900 --> 22:39.901
Paprika.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.446
- What?
- The lab results you requested.

22:44.739 --> 22:45.740
Paprika?

22:46.408 --> 22:48.159
And sodium too, Camila.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.453
Salt.

23:03.425 --> 23:04.509
Marques.

23:04.592 --> 23:07.262
<i>The son of a bitch ate them, Marques.</i>

23:08.430 --> 23:10.348
- What do you mean?
- <i>Cannibalism.</i>

24:18.625 --> 24:21.753
<i>Your call</i>
<i>is being forwarded to voice mail…</i>

24:48.613 --> 24:50.990
More work, Chico?
Can't you see I'm on my own here?

24:54.536 --> 24:55.537
What's up?

24:57.580 --> 24:59.916
They're saying it's Paula's daughter.

25:22.897 --> 25:25.358
Ready? Okay, ready in three, two…

25:25.442 --> 25:29.863
We're waiting here at White Mist
for the arrival of the Spanish consul…

25:29.946 --> 25:32.615
…to cover one
of the most brutal cases of all time.

25:32.699 --> 25:35.618
…treated with violent methods
and died here.

25:35.702 --> 25:40.331
The hospital opened in 1949
and was closed for 30 years in 1970.

25:40.415 --> 25:43.251
<i>In the 2000s,</i>
<i>it was reopened by Dr. Schultz…</i>

25:43.335 --> 25:44.878
CONSUL CASE

25:44.961 --> 25:47.339
What now?
Did you see what's happening?

25:47.422 --> 25:50.717
Relax, Seixas.
The press is always like this.

25:54.137 --> 25:57.974
They just want a bit of a show
to satiate their ignorant audience.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.393
What should I do, sir?

26:00.477 --> 26:05.690
Curiously, Almeida has been
Dr. Schultz's patient for over five years.

26:05.774 --> 26:09.319
You take care of the press.
I'll take care of Almeida.

26:09.402 --> 26:12.113
I need to understand
what happened to my patient.

26:13.365 --> 26:16.034
The police have not yet
been able to determine

26:16.117 --> 26:19.496
the exact number of victims involved
in this brutal crime.

26:28.797 --> 26:30.465
I want to talk to Paula Costa.

27:10.130 --> 27:11.131
Seixas.

27:11.214 --> 27:13.925
Relax. Good afternoon.
I'll answer your questions.

27:14.009 --> 27:17.512
Consul Almeida is not here yet,
but he is expected here at the hospital.

27:17.595 --> 27:20.974
- What's the diagnosis?
- We are not able to answer that yet.

27:21.057 --> 27:24.060
- Who will be treating him?
- Dr. Schultz himself.

27:24.144 --> 27:25.687
But he treated him for years,

27:25.770 --> 27:28.481
failing to see that his patient
was potentially a cannibal.

27:28.565 --> 27:29.774
- Well…

27:30.483 --> 27:32.736
Folks! That must be the consul's car.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.362
Wait! You can't go there!

27:39.909 --> 27:41.619
Paula, you need to rest.

27:42.704 --> 27:45.040
Just give us some time. We'll be quick.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.403
I dreamt that…

28:19.240 --> 28:21.493
I had a bad feeling…

28:24.037 --> 28:25.580
I didn't do anything.

28:26.623 --> 28:29.084
There was nothing you could have done.

28:29.626 --> 28:32.212
It was just like what happened
with my parents.

28:32.295 --> 28:34.172
It's not your fault, Paula.

28:35.465 --> 28:37.425
But it's different now.

28:40.512 --> 28:42.305
Did you see Lúcia's body?

28:48.645 --> 28:49.646
I did.

28:51.231 --> 28:52.899
They didn't let me see it.

28:54.109 --> 28:57.070
- They didn't even let me get close.
- Nor should they.

28:58.446 --> 29:01.908
- I'm not leaving this place anytime soon.
- You are getting out.

29:01.991 --> 29:03.368
I know I'm not.

29:03.868 --> 29:05.078
She has to go.

29:10.417 --> 29:11.501
Marques.

29:12.252 --> 29:14.087
Ask Marques to investigate, okay?

29:14.587 --> 29:16.131
Get some rest, okay?

29:21.428 --> 29:22.595
Camila…

29:25.890 --> 29:27.517
it happened again.

29:29.102 --> 29:30.228
Get some rest.

29:39.154 --> 29:42.365
We are following the arrival
of the Spanish consul to Brazil

29:42.449 --> 29:45.035
here at the White Mist
psychiatric hospital.

29:45.118 --> 29:46.911
He's accused of being responsible

29:46.995 --> 29:49.456
for the brutal death
of a group of teenagers.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.296
Stand back!

29:58.048 --> 30:00.884
He's not answering any questions.

30:00.967 --> 30:03.136


30:03.219 --> 30:05.096
Almeida! Almeida!

30:05.180 --> 30:06.681
Almeida!

30:07.265 --> 30:09.434
A statement, please, Almeida!

30:09.517 --> 30:12.270
Almeida! Almeida!
Did you commit those crimes?

30:12.354 --> 30:13.772
Almeida! Almeida!

30:22.447 --> 30:24.240
Here, here! Help me, damn it!

30:30.914 --> 30:31.998
Here, help me!

30:44.010 --> 30:47.514
Marques. I've just been to visit Paula.

30:48.390 --> 30:51.434
It was rough. I need a favor.

30:53.937 --> 30:56.523
You need to take this medication, Paula.

30:56.606 --> 30:58.733
It'll do you good. Do you understand?

31:12.580 --> 31:15.458
Don't forget to drink lots of fluids.

31:25.343 --> 31:27.804
Well done. Good night, dear.

31:36.771 --> 31:39.482
Get me out of here!

32:50.929 --> 32:52.180
White Cedar Restaurant

32:52.263 --> 32:54.349
White Cedar Restaurant

32:54.432 --> 32:56.393
I told her not to go out, mister.

33:01.731 --> 33:02.857
Was she alone?

33:03.525 --> 33:04.734
She was alone.

33:08.697 --> 33:11.449
- Was there anyone else here? A customer?
- There was.

33:12.409 --> 33:15.120
A tall man wearing a hood.
He looked kind of weird.

33:16.454 --> 33:18.957
- Weird how?
- He had a white eye.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.503
Is that all you remember?

33:23.586 --> 33:24.713
Uh-huh.

34:53.134 --> 34:54.678
Someone, open up!

34:55.220 --> 34:56.888
Open up!

36:11.588 --> 36:12.589
Paula.

36:17.010 --> 36:18.762
What are you doing here?

36:20.263 --> 36:23.475
- He's going to kill me.
- Who?

36:23.558 --> 36:26.353
He was here behind me. He's following me.

36:27.270 --> 36:29.439
It was just a nightmare.

36:29.939 --> 36:32.192
You're safe in here with us.

36:32.942 --> 36:34.569
Come on.

36:35.111 --> 36:36.780
I'll take you to your room.

36:38.156 --> 36:39.240
Come on.

36:41.534 --> 36:42.535
Come on.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.414
Look. Everything's all right.

36:52.629 --> 36:53.672
Come on.

37:10.647 --> 37:12.357
Get some rest.
