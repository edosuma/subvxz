<i>Suits</i>

00:01.163 --> 00:03.320
Less than
1 out of every 12 people

00:03.420 --> 00:04.520
who applies gets in.

00:04.522 --> 00:05.955
What if I'm not one
of those people?

00:05.957 --> 00:08.524
I don't know. Maybe you'll
get in somewhere else.

00:08.526 --> 00:09.926
I don't want to go
to law school.

00:09.928 --> 00:11.093
I want to go to Harvard.

00:11.095 --> 00:15.031
I got 100% faith in you.

00:15.033 --> 00:17.199
[Softly]
I didn't get in.

00:17.201 --> 00:18.401
I promised her.

00:18.403 --> 00:20.803
Louis, I liked her.

00:20.805 --> 00:23.005
You're just going to have
to tell her the truth.

00:23.007 --> 00:25.541
Sometimes good
isn't good enough.

00:25.543 --> 00:29.111
I want my name
on the door.

00:29.113 --> 00:31.047
So if you deliver
a huge win...

00:31.049 --> 00:33.382
I get my name
on the door.

00:33.384 --> 00:35.185
Are you talking
about joining forces with her?

00:35.186 --> 00:38.154
Not just with her,
with her firm--

00:38.156 --> 00:41.090
her infinitely
deep-pocketed firm.

00:41.092 --> 00:42.091
Edward and I
are merging.

00:42.093 --> 00:43.259
I had to show him
the books.

00:43.261 --> 00:44.727
You don't want your name
on the door.

00:44.729 --> 00:46.228
You want your name
on my door.

00:46.230 --> 00:48.698
I want to see our names
on the same door.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.366
This is exactly
what you've always wanted.

00:50.368 --> 00:51.467
Get over your pride.

00:51.469 --> 00:54.003
I'm not getting
over anything.

00:54.005 --> 00:57.640
And this merger
isn't happening.

00:57.642 --> 01:00.309
- Those are your clients.
- Who Harvey is using.

01:00.311 --> 01:04.013
- That's a bullshit argument.
- And so is that file.

01:06.917 --> 01:08.150
- I won't.
- You will.

01:08.152 --> 01:09.418
Harvey will never
forgive me.

01:09.420 --> 01:11.921
Right now your problem
isn't with Harvey.

01:11.923 --> 01:13.923
Your problem is with me.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.041
Champagne?

01:32.043 --> 01:34.043
- Depends.
- On what?

01:34.045 --> 01:35.745
On whether or not
there's a roofie in there.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.446
I wouldn't need a roofie.

01:37.448 --> 01:39.982
Jessica, uh, might I have
a private word?

01:39.984 --> 01:41.450
Actually,
Harvey and I were--

01:41.452 --> 01:42.918
Don't mind me.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.353
My date just got here.

01:44.355 --> 01:46.022
Edward.
Harvey.

01:46.024 --> 01:49.458
Hell of a party.

02:00.604 --> 02:01.604
You look...

02:01.606 --> 02:03.005
Beautiful.
I know.

02:03.007 --> 02:04.974
Actually, I was going
to say "sophisticated."

02:04.976 --> 02:07.643
- No, you weren't.
- I can now.

02:11.415 --> 02:13.949
You seem different.
I feel different.

02:13.951 --> 02:15.651
What's going on?

02:15.653 --> 02:19.121
You know, why don't you
get me a drink?

02:19.123 --> 02:20.256
It's a party.

02:20.258 --> 02:22.625
Okay.

02:22.627 --> 02:24.360
Harvey.

02:24.362 --> 02:25.795
Rachel.

02:25.797 --> 02:26.996
You look nice.

02:26.998 --> 02:29.131
Thank you.
So do I.

02:29.133 --> 02:33.169
Now I see what
you're always talking about.

02:33.171 --> 02:34.670
What was that
supposed to mean?

02:34.672 --> 02:36.772
What do you think it means?
It means you're a dick.

02:36.774 --> 02:38.274
Fair point.

02:38.276 --> 02:39.909
I just didn't know
that she knew that.

02:39.911 --> 02:41.077
Everyone knows that.

02:41.079 --> 02:45.715
- You bring it?
- Right here.

02:45.717 --> 02:47.883
You sure you want
to do this to her?

02:47.885 --> 02:49.351
You're supposed to be
on my side.

02:49.353 --> 02:50.920
I am.
I've got your back.

02:50.922 --> 02:52.722
Then why are you giving me
such a hard time about it?

02:52.724 --> 02:54.657
Not only am I not giving you
a hard time,

02:54.659 --> 02:57.293
but I am giving you this...

02:57.295 --> 03:01.330
and this and this.

03:01.332 --> 03:04.834
Now, if you'll excuse me...
Where are you going?

03:04.836 --> 03:06.602
Oh, I'm going to go get
a drink

03:06.604 --> 03:08.671
while this
is still a party.

03:16.179 --> 03:18.180
- Hi, may I--
- Excuse me, good sir.

03:18.182 --> 03:19.715
Would you be so kind
as to prepare me...

03:19.717 --> 03:22.685
A frapin cuvee?
Easy, Prince Charles.

03:22.687 --> 03:24.954
Where I'm from,
you wait your turn in line.

03:24.956 --> 03:26.055
Oh, I'm so sorry,

03:26.057 --> 03:27.590
but I thought
you'd been served.

03:27.592 --> 03:30.159
The barman is patiently
waiting on you,

03:30.161 --> 03:33.362
so I'd stop standing there
like some sort of baboon

03:33.364 --> 03:36.565
and order your Miller Lite.

03:36.567 --> 03:38.134
Macallan 25, neat.

03:38.136 --> 03:40.236
Why don't you put a banana
in it for my man here?

03:40.238 --> 03:42.238
With a drink like that,
you might as well be in a zoo,

03:42.240 --> 03:43.439
playing about in the mud.

03:43.441 --> 03:44.774
Oh, you wouldn't know
anything about mud.

03:44.776 --> 03:46.275
It's not for playing.
It's for cleansing.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.224
You mud?

03:50.782 --> 03:52.014
I've taken mud
in more places

03:52.016 --> 03:53.716
than your snooty little mind
can fathom.

03:53.718 --> 03:55.151
Calais.

03:55.153 --> 03:56.519
- Cliffs or Harbor?
- Both.

03:56.521 --> 03:57.820
Me too.
Sedona.

03:57.822 --> 03:59.555
- Isle of Wight.
- Joshua tree.

03:59.557 --> 04:00.823
- Dalyan.
- Baden-Baden.

04:00.825 --> 04:04.660
That isn't mud.
It's wet dirt.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.328
You know, I don't know
who you think you are--

04:06.330 --> 04:09.665
My moniker is
Nigel Alexander Nesbitt.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.268
Well, Nigel,
when you impugn

04:12.270 --> 04:14.570
the life-affirming muds
of Baden-Baden,

04:14.572 --> 04:16.471
you're on the precipice
of the equivalent

04:16.474 --> 04:20.075
of someone taking a shit
on the royal muds of England.

04:20.077 --> 04:21.810
How dare you?

04:21.813 --> 04:23.479
Oh, I've already dared...

04:23.481 --> 04:25.714
To do...
What I've done.

04:34.224 --> 04:35.391
Ah, Harvey.

04:35.393 --> 04:37.259
I was hoping we might have
a moment alone.

04:37.261 --> 04:38.394
So was I.

04:38.396 --> 04:41.130
I wanted to run something
by you.

04:41.132 --> 04:44.233
- This is a lawsuit.
- Three lawsuits.

04:44.235 --> 04:46.902
What have I gotten
up to now?

04:46.904 --> 04:48.971
Not you, your clients.

04:48.973 --> 04:51.540
Looks like one of their hobbies
is fixing prices.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.175
I take it this means

04:53.177 --> 04:54.677
you've discovered
we're in merger talks?

04:54.679 --> 04:56.245
And what are you going
to do about it?

04:56.247 --> 04:58.514
- What would you have me do?
- I'd have you kiss my ass.

04:58.516 --> 05:00.349
Tempting.

05:00.351 --> 05:03.586
However, what I can do
is enjoy this glass of wine,

05:03.588 --> 05:05.588
finish this lovely party,

05:05.590 --> 05:07.489
and proceed to make you
permanently regret

05:07.491 --> 05:09.892
the hostile action
you've just set in motion.

05:09.894 --> 05:12.361
What, are you going
to kill me?

05:12.363 --> 05:13.863
Nonsense.

05:13.865 --> 05:16.098
I'll simply do what I've done
to so many before.

05:16.100 --> 05:18.067
I'll defeat you
in open court.

05:18.069 --> 05:21.737
The way I work, it's never
going to get to open court.

05:21.739 --> 05:23.606
You'll be on your steamer
back to London,

05:23.608 --> 05:25.608
wondering what happened,
and you'll know

05:25.610 --> 05:27.276
that you picked a fight
with the wrong guy.

05:27.278 --> 05:30.212
Are you suggesting
a wager?

05:30.214 --> 05:33.249
I'm not a gambler,
but in this case,

05:33.251 --> 05:34.516
I'll make an exception.

05:34.518 --> 05:38.721
You lose,
we don't merge.

05:38.723 --> 05:40.990
I've heard your terms.
You win, I go.

05:40.992 --> 05:42.258
Care to hear mine?

05:42.260 --> 05:43.525
Don't need to

05:43.527 --> 05:46.762
'cause you're never
going to win.

05:46.764 --> 05:49.598
Well, it looks like you two
are getting along.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.600
Mm.

05:53.470 --> 05:56.505
Harvey...

05:56.507 --> 05:58.407
Look at what
they can give us.

05:58.409 --> 06:00.142
How do you know
what they can give us?

06:00.144 --> 06:01.777
Because he showed me
their books.

06:01.779 --> 06:03.913
- Why did he do that?
- Because I showed him ours.

06:03.915 --> 06:05.214
Why didn't you tell me?

06:05.216 --> 06:07.950
- We needed their help.
- To beat Hardman.

06:07.952 --> 06:09.752
And I didn't want
you worrying

06:09.754 --> 06:12.087
that we would owe him
for the rest of our lives.

06:12.089 --> 06:14.757
You don't marry someone
just because they knock you up.

06:14.759 --> 06:17.393
All right, Harvey,
here it is.

06:17.395 --> 06:18.694
You lose,

06:18.696 --> 06:21.764
you embrace this partnership
with no reservations.

06:21.766 --> 06:23.165
He can beat me,

06:23.167 --> 06:26.502
I'll welcome him
with arms wide open.

06:26.504 --> 06:28.771
He can't,
we send him back to England,

06:28.773 --> 06:30.906
and he can spend his time
fixing his teeth.

06:30.908 --> 06:32.141
Fine.

06:32.143 --> 06:34.410
You beat Edward,
we don't do this.

06:34.412 --> 06:37.046
And since you didn't want
to hear Darby's terms,

06:37.048 --> 06:38.881
these are mine.

06:38.883 --> 06:40.816
You win,
you get what you want.

06:40.818 --> 06:42.751
You lose, you stay,

06:42.753 --> 06:44.286
you extend
your noncompete,

06:44.288 --> 06:48.724
and you get a chance
to earn your name on the door

06:48.726 --> 06:50.826

going up there now.

You?

Last night was
a personal attack on me.

07:49.575 --> 07:51.475
Oh, that's funny
because Jessica seemed to think

07:51.477 --> 07:53.544
it was a personal attack
on her,

07:53.546 --> 07:55.346
yet both of you knew
about the merger

07:55.348 --> 07:56.714
and chose
not to tell me.

07:56.716 --> 07:58.783
You should get lunch--seems like
you have a lot in common.

07:58.785 --> 07:59.917
Harvey.
Harvey.

07:59.919 --> 08:02.119
Can you stop being so defensive
for one second?

08:02.121 --> 08:03.587
You put me
on the defensive.

08:03.589 --> 08:05.589
And I'm not just going to stand
here and listen to you

08:05.591 --> 08:07.158
because I went
on the attack.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.259
Harvey--

08:08.261 --> 08:09.927
No, don't "Harvey" me, okay?

08:09.929 --> 08:11.228
You made your bed,

08:11.230 --> 08:12.697
and now you're going to sleep
in it alone.

08:12.699 --> 08:16.233
What did I do
that was so terrible?

08:16.235 --> 08:19.103
For the past nine months,
I have been fending off attacks

08:19.105 --> 08:22.506
from Daniel Hardman,
Allison Holt, and Robert Zane.

08:22.508 --> 08:23.674
I told you before.

08:23.676 --> 08:25.543
You want to get your name
on the door,

08:25.545 --> 08:28.512
get it
at your own goddamn firm.

08:28.514 --> 08:30.014
Okay.
Fine.

08:30.016 --> 08:31.482
If it's not personal,

08:31.484 --> 08:33.551
you're not going to hold it
against me when we beat you.

08:33.553 --> 08:35.119
0 and everything,
Scottie.

08:35.121 --> 08:36.486
That's your record
against me--

08:36.489 --> 08:38.054
0 and everything.

08:38.057 --> 08:39.890
I won't have
to hold anything against you

08:39.892 --> 08:41.726
because there won't be
anything to hold.

08:46.598 --> 08:48.032
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:48.034 --> 08:50.401
I never got to buy you
that drink last night.

08:50.403 --> 08:53.637
- They we free.
- I know.

08:53.639 --> 08:54.638
You left.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.340
- I did.
- It was a nice party.

08:56.342 --> 08:57.842
- It was.
- Mm-hmm.

08:57.844 --> 09:00.478
Mmhmm.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.346
Okay, so I see you're still
not going to tell me why--

09:02.348 --> 09:05.850
I didn't get
into Harvard.

09:07.219 --> 09:08.619
Don't look at me that way.

09:08.621 --> 09:10.187
With sympathy?

09:10.189 --> 09:13.324
- With pity.
- I wasn't. Rachel...

09:13.326 --> 09:15.092
Listen to me.
There are other schools.

09:15.094 --> 09:17.728
Don't.

09:17.730 --> 09:20.331
Yeah.
I won't.

09:22.334 --> 09:25.369
It wasn't
that I wasn't good enough.

09:25.371 --> 09:26.370
I know that.

09:26.372 --> 09:28.773
- It was Louis.
- What?

09:28.775 --> 09:30.174
The interviewer--

09:30.176 --> 09:33.711
um, apparently she and Louis
had a history, and--

09:33.713 --> 09:35.713
Wait. She didn't let you in
because of him?

09:35.715 --> 09:37.081
That's...
I know.

09:37.083 --> 09:39.083
- Not right.
- I know.

09:39.085 --> 09:42.019
[Scoffs]

09:42.021 --> 09:46.557
Tell me about the day
you found out.

09:46.559 --> 09:48.592
- Rachel, come on.
- No.

09:48.594 --> 09:52.129
I need to hear how it felt
from someone who got in

09:52.131 --> 09:56.267
because I'll--I'll never hear
that for myself.

10:01.273 --> 10:03.240
You're looking at me
like that again.

10:03.242 --> 10:04.475
I'm not.

10:04.477 --> 10:05.676
Then what?

10:05.678 --> 10:08.913
It's just not right.

10:11.183 --> 10:14.819
Yeah.

10:18.490 --> 10:21.091
It was a pleasure
meeting you.

10:21.093 --> 10:23.260
- [Mouthing words]
- [Chuckles]

10:25.897 --> 10:27.731
What the hell
was that?

10:27.733 --> 10:28.766
What was what?

10:28.768 --> 10:30.234
What were you doing
with Donna?

10:30.236 --> 10:31.735
I was caressing
her lovely hand

10:31.737 --> 10:33.170
with my lovely lips.

10:33.172 --> 10:34.505
You know what I mean.

10:34.507 --> 10:36.607
What are you doing here?
Oh, that.

10:36.609 --> 10:39.343
I was being treated to a tour
of your little outpost.

10:39.345 --> 10:40.444
I'll grant you this,

10:40.446 --> 10:42.880
you've got quite
the spectacular view...

10:42.882 --> 10:44.715
Though truth be told,
my favorite spot

10:44.717 --> 10:47.151
was inside
Ms. Paulsen's cubicle.

10:47.153 --> 10:50.087
[Elevator bell dings]

10:59.064 --> 11:00.297
How could you?

11:00.299 --> 11:01.832
- How could I what?
- Don't.

11:01.834 --> 11:04.468
You let that man
inside your cubicle.

11:04.470 --> 11:06.103
Inside my what?

11:06.105 --> 11:10.007
Nigel Nesbitt--
I mean, you let him...

11:10.009 --> 11:12.009
I have never crossed
the boundary of your cubicle.

11:12.011 --> 11:13.711
And should that honor
ever be bestowed on me,

11:13.713 --> 11:15.946
at least I'd be gentleman enough
to keep it between us.

11:15.948 --> 11:17.448
I mean, I have
too much respect for you.

11:17.450 --> 11:20.084
Louis, he leaned over
to get a file.

11:20.086 --> 11:23.354
He's doing
an efficiency list.

11:23.356 --> 11:25.022
Oh, thank God.

11:25.024 --> 11:27.458
Wait a second. I've been asked
to do an efficiency list.

11:27.460 --> 11:29.360
- So do one.
- No, you don't get it.

11:29.362 --> 11:32.329
It's inefficient to have two
people doing efficiency lists.

11:32.331 --> 11:33.464
It's a test.

11:33.466 --> 11:35.399
- To see who's better.
- How dare they?

11:35.401 --> 11:38.369
Man, you know, it's bad enough
that smug bastard thinks

11:38.371 --> 11:40.271
he's higher up
on the mud chain than me.

11:40.273 --> 11:42.139
Is he?

11:42.141 --> 11:43.674
- Uh-oh.
- Again?

11:43.676 --> 11:45.409
Didn't you tell him
about Cartagena?

11:45.411 --> 11:47.511
I was on tilt
after he nullified Baden-Baden.

11:47.513 --> 11:48.846
What the hell
is wrong with you?

11:48.848 --> 11:52.516
I let him out-mud me.

11:52.518 --> 11:54.118
What am I going to do?

11:54.120 --> 11:55.886
Okay, I'm going to tell you
exactly what you're going to do.

11:55.888 --> 11:57.521
You're going
to pull your shit together,

11:57.523 --> 11:59.523
and you're going to kick
his limey ass.

11:59.525 --> 12:00.925
You're goddamn right.

12:00.927 --> 12:03.527
Louis, I know you.
Harold is gone.

12:03.529 --> 12:05.829
Do not take your frustrations
out on somebody else.

12:05.831 --> 12:07.097
Oh, Donna, remember,
I told you.

12:07.099 --> 12:09.266
I am not that man anymore.
I would never let any--

12:09.268 --> 12:11.869
what the hell
are you looking at, asshole?

12:11.871 --> 12:15.039
Right.

12:15.041 --> 12:18.042
[Clears throat]

12:19.945 --> 12:21.712
Uh, can I help you?

12:21.714 --> 12:23.881
No, no.
I'm fine.

12:23.883 --> 12:26.850
Just had a mochaccino.
Waiting to see Harvey.

12:26.852 --> 12:28.385
He's making you wait?

12:28.387 --> 12:30.654
Oh, I don't actually believe
he's aware I'm here.

12:30.656 --> 12:32.556
So why don't you go in?

12:32.558 --> 12:34.525
Well, his secretary
isn't present to announce me.

12:34.527 --> 12:35.592
It wouldn't be proper.

12:35.594 --> 12:37.294
- What year is it?
- Hmm?

12:37.296 --> 12:38.529
- Huh?
- Mike?

12:38.531 --> 12:40.397
- Yeah?
- What's going on out there?

12:40.399 --> 12:42.566
Um, it's kind of hard
to explain.

12:42.568 --> 12:43.834
Have you ever seen
<i>Downton Abbey?</i>

12:43.836 --> 12:45.269
What?

12:45.271 --> 12:47.071
I haven't caught it,
but I've heard great things.

12:47.073 --> 12:48.472
Yeah, it's terrific.

12:48.474 --> 12:50.841
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:50.843 --> 12:53.477
May I present
Mr. Edward Darby of--

12:53.479 --> 12:55.479
- Get the hell out of here.
- Okay.

12:55.481 --> 12:58.682
- Oh, I'll Netflix it.
- You should.

12:58.684 --> 13:00.184
I don't mean to pry,

13:00.186 --> 13:02.119
but is that how you treat
all your underlings?

13:02.121 --> 13:03.253
What?

13:03.255 --> 13:04.521
Well, just being curious,

13:04.523 --> 13:07.091
but how would you like
to be spoken to that way?

13:07.093 --> 13:08.459
Listen, Benny Hill,

13:08.461 --> 13:09.526
I'm a little busy

13:09.528 --> 13:11.128
preparing a motion
to kick your ass.

13:11.130 --> 13:13.430
You mind getting to the point?
Well, that is the point.

13:13.432 --> 13:15.232
You may have
to expediate that motion

13:15.234 --> 13:17.201
a little faster
than you think.

13:17.203 --> 13:19.770
Tomorrow I'll be freezing
your assets.

13:19.772 --> 13:20.938
What?

13:20.940 --> 13:22.806
Hmm. It seems that one
of the three companies

13:22.808 --> 13:25.042
you picked a Dickens with
has a cousin

13:25.044 --> 13:27.778
who happens to be the president
of a consortium of banks,

13:27.780 --> 13:29.146
whereby...

13:29.148 --> 13:31.281
Well, you get the picture.

13:31.283 --> 13:34.118
I'd move as much money
as possible forthwith.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.219
Let me get this straight.

13:35.221 --> 13:37.021
You're coming in here
to warn me

13:37.023 --> 13:38.756
that you're going to freeze
my client's assets?

13:38.758 --> 13:39.890
Of course.

13:39.892 --> 13:41.458
This way,
you'll have time

13:41.460 --> 13:44.828
to transfer a bit of currency
to fund your legal battle.

13:44.830 --> 13:46.630
It wouldn't be sporting,
otherwise.

13:46.632 --> 13:48.332
- "Sporting"?
- Certainly.

13:48.334 --> 13:51.568
One doesn't hunt the fox
while it's still in its den.

13:51.570 --> 13:52.836
One sounds the horn

13:52.838 --> 13:54.439
and allows the poor creature
a head start

13:54.440 --> 13:55.939
before giving chase.

13:55.941 --> 13:58.042
You think I'm the fox?

13:58.044 --> 13:59.743
Think it?

13:59.745 --> 14:02.312
The only one
who doesn't know that is you.

14:15.319 --> 14:16.853
You and me...

14:16.855 --> 14:18.087
Right now...

14:18.089 --> 14:20.890
Game of efficiency list.

14:20.892 --> 14:23.559
I'm afraid I don't have
my files with me.

14:23.561 --> 14:25.394
Files are for pussies.

14:25.396 --> 14:27.563
Right you are.

14:27.565 --> 14:29.365
I was just trying
to give you a way out.

14:29.367 --> 14:30.733
I looked into you.

14:30.735 --> 14:33.603
And I you,
Louis Marlowe Litt.

14:33.605 --> 14:35.438
You, as everyone else
in your firm,

14:35.440 --> 14:36.906
graduated
from Harvard Law.

14:36.908 --> 14:38.174
And you, as everyone else
in your firm,

14:38.176 --> 14:40.076
graduated from either
Harvard or Cambridge,

14:40.078 --> 14:41.811
which waters down
the purity.

14:41.813 --> 14:43.779
However, I graduated
from both.

14:43.781 --> 14:45.748
That's inefficient.

14:45.750 --> 14:48.050
[Softly] Not when done
in three years.

14:48.052 --> 14:50.953
[Softly] Well, this isn't
about your efficiency.

14:50.955 --> 14:53.222
This is
about your efficiency list.

14:53.224 --> 14:55.358
[Normal voice]
My list isn't science.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.826
It's a work of art.

14:56.828 --> 15:00.630
Performance reviews
versus projected billables--

15:00.632 --> 15:01.631
child's play.

15:01.633 --> 15:04.300
I ain't no child.

15:04.302 --> 15:05.968
I begin
with life expectancy.

15:05.970 --> 15:07.236
I begin with nutrition.

15:07.238 --> 15:09.038
How do you think
I determine life expectancy?

15:09.040 --> 15:10.139
Number of sexual partners.

15:10.141 --> 15:12.775
- Relationship to mother.
- Pet ownership.

15:12.777 --> 15:15.511
The three things
are inextricably linked,

15:15.513 --> 15:18.180
and I have the formula
right here.

15:18.182 --> 15:20.750
Yeah, well, I...

15:20.752 --> 15:22.418
Just remembered
that I have a deposition

15:22.420 --> 15:24.353
that I have to go to
in conference room "D."

15:24.355 --> 15:26.889
There is
no conference room "D."

15:26.891 --> 15:29.091
They're re-lettering.

15:35.732 --> 15:37.333
Where are you off to
in such a hurry?

15:37.335 --> 15:39.735
Uh, I have to finish
this page-turner.

15:39.737 --> 15:40.836
<i>Harry Potter?</i>

15:40.838 --> 15:43.239
No, but it is
by a British author.

15:43.241 --> 15:45.341
Well, I've got something else
for you to read.

15:45.343 --> 15:46.542
- What?
- A letter.

15:46.544 --> 15:48.044
Oh, sweet.
It's not even my birthday.

15:48.046 --> 15:51.247
It's not to you.
It's from you.

15:54.885 --> 15:56.085
This is to Harvard.

15:56.087 --> 15:57.520
I'm going
over Sheila Sazs' head

15:57.522 --> 15:59.455
and telling them
everything that happened.

15:59.457 --> 16:01.223
Well, you are.

16:01.225 --> 16:02.525
- Rachel, you can't--
- No, come on.

16:02.527 --> 16:03.726
You said it yourself.

16:03.728 --> 16:05.528
It is not right
that I'm being denied admission

16:05.530 --> 16:07.029
because someone's
punishing Louis.

16:07.031 --> 16:08.598
It's not,
but I can't sign this.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.901
- Why not?
- Because it's not my place?

16:11.903 --> 16:14.203
- Well, then whose place is it?
- I didn't see what happened.

16:14.205 --> 16:15.538
It's hearsay.

16:15.540 --> 16:18.641
Mike, I'm someone
who wants to go to Harvard.

16:18.643 --> 16:20.643
You're someone
who went to Harvard.

16:20.645 --> 16:24.714
Who do you think
they're going to listen to more?

16:24.716 --> 16:28.184
Are you going
to help me or not?

16:32.022 --> 16:34.690
I'll help you.

16:39.596 --> 16:41.364
Whatever it is,
I'm not in the mood.

16:41.366 --> 16:44.367
I know about Rachel
and Sheila and Harvard.

16:46.203 --> 16:47.203
How?

16:47.205 --> 16:48.871
Rachel told me.

16:48.873 --> 16:52.608
She wants me to send this letter
going over Sheila's head,

16:52.610 --> 16:55.411
but it can't come from me.

16:58.548 --> 17:00.249
Yeah, it can't come
from anyone.

17:03.220 --> 17:06.155
[Sighs]

17:06.156 --> 17:07.455
She didn't get in

17:07.458 --> 17:09.125
because they didn't think
she was good enough.

17:09.127 --> 17:12.028
- You lied to her.
- No, I never lied to her.

17:12.030 --> 17:14.329
I told her she was good enough,
which she is,

17:14.332 --> 17:16.398
but I let her down because
I couldn't persuade Sheila,

17:16.401 --> 17:17.633
which is the truth.

17:17.635 --> 17:19.902
Louis, you have to tell her
the real truth.

17:19.904 --> 17:22.405
Mike, I saw the look
on her face,

17:22.406 --> 17:23.571
and I took it away.

17:23.574 --> 17:25.007
I do not want
to put it back.

17:25.009 --> 17:26.608
She is going
to pursue this.

17:26.611 --> 17:29.178
She's going to find out
one way or the other.

17:29.180 --> 17:30.846
I'm not going to let her
find out from Harvard.

17:30.848 --> 17:34.083
I can't tell her.

17:34.085 --> 17:37.319
You'll regret it.

17:37.321 --> 17:38.821
Look, I'll give you another day
to think about it,

17:38.823 --> 17:42.525
but after that,
I have to tell her myself.

17:42.527 --> 17:44.760
[Sighs]

17:49.633 --> 17:51.801
Gentlemen, I'm glad
you stopped by.

17:51.803 --> 17:53.302
I wanted to inform you

17:53.304 --> 17:55.404
I'm leaving town
on the morrow.

17:55.406 --> 17:57.940
I'll be having my number two
handle the case for me.

17:57.942 --> 17:59.041
I expect
you'll do the same.

17:59.043 --> 18:00.609
Why would I do that?

18:00.611 --> 18:02.712
It's tradition.
I leave it to you.

18:02.714 --> 18:05.514
Honor it or don't.
I say we honor it.

18:05.516 --> 18:08.451
Oh, by the by,
<i>Downton Abbey--</i>

18:08.453 --> 18:09.719
got it
in my briefcase.

18:09.721 --> 18:11.253
Plan to watch it
on the plane.

18:11.255 --> 18:12.688
Oh, my God.
You are going to--

18:12.690 --> 18:16.826
Please, please.
I abhor spoilers.

18:16.828 --> 18:18.561
Episode three--
that's all I'll say.

18:18.563 --> 18:19.729
Oh.

18:19.731 --> 18:20.730
Why don't you two
watch it together

18:20.732 --> 18:21.997
over a game
of Tiddlywinks?

18:21.999 --> 18:24.300
You seem to be upset
over my game

18:24.302 --> 18:26.502
of "let's put the peacock
in its place."

18:26.504 --> 18:27.903
I'm glad
you mentioned that.

18:27.905 --> 18:30.973
I brought a little
going-away present for you.

18:35.212 --> 18:37.213
This is a biscuit
and a bottle of water.

18:37.215 --> 18:39.682
It's what I assume
they serve in English prison,

18:39.684 --> 18:41.083
which is
where your client's going

18:41.085 --> 18:43.285
for freezing
our client's assets.

18:43.287 --> 18:45.321
It's a violation
of international law

18:45.323 --> 18:47.223
to intimidate a litigant
into settling

18:47.225 --> 18:50.226
by choking
their funding.

18:52.662 --> 18:55.531
You seem to think you've
got me by the short hairs.

18:55.533 --> 18:59.034
However, if you turn
to page 693 in this tome,

18:59.036 --> 19:01.170
you'll find an exception
to that very law.

19:01.172 --> 19:02.505
No, I won't.

19:02.507 --> 19:04.673
I've memorized this book.

19:04.675 --> 19:07.243
Yes, I was told
of your prowess,

19:07.245 --> 19:11.147
which is why I chose a law
not published in any book,

19:11.149 --> 19:15.184
but a long-standing provision
honored in England for decades.

19:15.186 --> 19:18.587
We can do what we like,
as long as notice is given.

19:18.589 --> 19:20.322
You don't give a shit
about being sporting.

19:20.324 --> 19:21.857
You just wanted
to skirt the law.

19:21.859 --> 19:24.693
Nonsense.
I wanted to do both.

19:24.695 --> 19:27.029
By filing this action,

19:27.031 --> 19:28.697
you have opened
your clients up

19:28.699 --> 19:30.766
to a charge
of malicious litigation.

19:30.768 --> 19:32.134
Which is
why you froze the assets

19:32.136 --> 19:33.135
in the first place.

19:33.137 --> 19:34.970
You baited us.

19:34.972 --> 19:39.308
In any case, you seem to be
backed up against the wall.

19:39.310 --> 19:41.243
I'm comfortable there.

19:41.245 --> 19:44.013
Gives me back support
for when I come out swinging.

19:44.015 --> 19:46.715
Well, you'd better
do something quickly.

19:46.717 --> 19:48.450
Your clients
don't have the funds

19:48.452 --> 19:51.387
to proceed beyond, I'd say,
this week's end.

19:51.389 --> 19:54.990
Now, if you'll excuse me...

19:54.992 --> 19:55.991
Hey.

19:55.993 --> 19:57.426
Episode three--

19:57.428 --> 20:01.163
Lady Mary and the Turk do it,
and then the Turk dies.

20:05.402 --> 20:07.269
Sorry.

20:07.271 --> 20:09.738
Jessica, you wanted
to see me?

20:09.740 --> 20:11.507
I thought you were supposed
to be announced.

20:11.509 --> 20:13.943
You summoned me.
That supersedes an announcement.

20:13.945 --> 20:15.377
How can I help you?

20:15.379 --> 20:17.813
I understand
you're leaving town tomorrow

20:17.815 --> 20:21.050
and putting Dana Scott
in your stead.

20:21.052 --> 20:24.587
Yes, I have some business
to attend to on the coast.

20:24.589 --> 20:28.757
Yes, your business
with Bayne-Powlen in Los Angeles

20:28.759 --> 20:31.327
and Tillson-Tuttle
in San Francisco.

20:31.329 --> 20:32.895
Do you really think

20:32.897 --> 20:34.897
you could take meetings
with other firms

20:34.899 --> 20:36.165
and I wouldn't know?

20:36.167 --> 20:38.634
- Why would I not?
- Because we have a deal.

20:38.636 --> 20:41.470
That deal presupposed
that you could control your man.

20:41.472 --> 20:43.138
I can control him.

20:43.140 --> 20:45.140
Then why the hell
did you allow our wager?

20:45.142 --> 20:46.809
For the same damn reason
you made it.

20:46.811 --> 20:50.246
If I can't beat him,
he won't respect me.

20:50.248 --> 20:52.047
And if he doesn't
respect you,

20:52.049 --> 20:55.284
he won't respect me,
and he will eventually leave.

20:55.286 --> 20:57.186
And he's too valuable
an asset.

20:57.188 --> 20:59.154
I didn't just fall
off a turnip truck.

20:59.156 --> 21:02.024
No, I don't suppose
you did.

21:02.026 --> 21:04.059
The truth is,
you're afraid you might lose.

21:04.061 --> 21:05.961
I'm afraid of nothing
of the sort.

21:05.963 --> 21:09.231
Then why are you taking
meetings with other firms?

21:09.233 --> 21:12.134
You gave me your word
on this deal,

21:12.136 --> 21:15.170
so either you're going
to win and break it,

21:15.172 --> 21:17.606
or you're afraid.

21:17.608 --> 21:21.043
I never break my word.

21:21.045 --> 21:24.947
Then there it is.

21:24.949 --> 21:26.248
I'm not afraid,

21:26.250 --> 21:28.250
but I didn't get
where I am

21:28.252 --> 21:30.085
without taking
some precautions.

21:30.087 --> 21:32.388
Then go ahead
and take them.

21:32.390 --> 21:33.956
But you're wasting
your time

21:33.958 --> 21:36.759
because we're not losing
this case.

21:49.001 --> 21:51.169
Hey, can I, uh, talk
to you for a sec?

21:51.171 --> 21:54.606
What is it, Louis?
I'm just a little busy now.

21:54.608 --> 21:56.774
I just wanted to say
that I know you've been taking

21:56.776 --> 21:58.943
a lot of heat
from Jessica, and...

21:58.945 --> 22:00.612
I'm glad you did
what you did.

22:00.614 --> 22:02.313
That's not supposed
to be public knowledge.

22:02.315 --> 22:03.414
Well, no,
Donna told me

22:03.416 --> 22:07.619
because she knows
that I support you 100%.

22:07.621 --> 22:09.587
Do you?

22:09.589 --> 22:12.457
Nigel Nesbitt--
my British counterpart.

22:12.459 --> 22:13.491
What about him?

22:13.493 --> 22:15.160
He out-mudded me.

22:15.162 --> 22:16.461
Didn't you tell him
about Cartagena?

22:16.463 --> 22:18.296
Oh, would we be having
this conversation if I had?

22:18.298 --> 22:19.464
Louis, relax.

22:19.466 --> 22:20.999
I know how seriously
you take your mudding,

22:21.001 --> 22:22.500
but that's personal.

22:22.502 --> 22:24.369
It doesn't mean
he's a better lawyer.

22:24.371 --> 22:26.437
Yeah, but he didn't
just out-mud me, Harvey.

22:26.439 --> 22:29.040
He out-listed me.
He out-educated me.

22:29.042 --> 22:30.775
He...

22:30.777 --> 22:32.710
out-me'd me.

22:32.712 --> 22:34.445
And if this guy
out-finances me...

22:34.447 --> 22:35.446
I understand.

22:35.448 --> 22:37.849
I mean, but really,
do you?

22:37.851 --> 22:39.450
Because I fought
tooth and nail

22:39.452 --> 22:41.019
to become one
of 30 senior partners,

22:41.021 --> 22:42.420
and I'm the best
at what I do.

22:42.422 --> 22:43.655
But if this merger
goes through,

22:43.657 --> 22:45.023
I'm going to be one
of 150,

22:45.025 --> 22:49.027
and I'm not going to be
the best of anything.

22:49.029 --> 22:52.096
Harvey, I'm scared.

22:52.098 --> 22:54.032
Please tell me
we're going to win this thing.

22:54.034 --> 22:56.267
Our backs are
against the wall.

23:00.839 --> 23:01.940
What do you need?

23:01.942 --> 23:03.975
Right now I need
to buy some time.

23:03.977 --> 23:07.078
- That's easy.
- What?

23:07.080 --> 23:08.479
You once told me
what to do

23:08.481 --> 23:09.981
when your back's
against the wall.

23:09.983 --> 23:12.617
Break the goddamn thing down.

23:12.619 --> 23:14.719
That's right.

23:14.721 --> 23:17.222
- You have access to that shit?
- All of it.

23:17.224 --> 23:19.224
They needed me
to do an efficiency list.

23:19.226 --> 23:21.859
We got 'em.

23:24.029 --> 23:26.397
You're not
Mr. Chong's Chinese food.

23:26.399 --> 23:28.233
Oh, I ran into him
on my way in.

23:28.235 --> 23:29.867
I just sent him away.
Why would you do that?

23:29.869 --> 23:32.537
M.S.G.--It's terrible for you.
Plus, I ate it.

23:32.539 --> 23:33.705
[Sighs]

23:33.707 --> 23:35.039
What's this?

23:35.041 --> 23:36.307
It's what
you're going to use

23:36.309 --> 23:37.609
against Scottie
tomorrow morning.

23:37.611 --> 23:38.676
Me?

23:38.678 --> 23:40.545
You're going in
as number two.

23:40.547 --> 23:42.146
I don't want to give Edward
any excuses.

23:42.148 --> 23:43.581
You mean you don't want
to deal with Scottie.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.083
Well, that's just
a side benefit.

23:45.085 --> 23:47.318
Right.

23:47.320 --> 23:48.453
Whoa, wait a second.

23:48.455 --> 23:50.888
This is confidential information
from the merger.

23:50.890 --> 23:52.724
Which you're going to use
to get us a reprieve.

23:52.726 --> 23:54.058
You broke
the Chinese wall?

23:54.060 --> 23:55.126
Why do you think I'm here?

23:55.128 --> 23:57.328
Harvey, this is
inadmissible stuff.

23:57.330 --> 23:58.630
And it's in the ballpark

23:58.632 --> 24:00.331
of what Tanner accused you of
with Coastal Motors.

24:00.333 --> 24:03.901
You think
I don't know that?

24:03.903 --> 24:05.336
Are you sure
you want to do this?

24:05.338 --> 24:07.872
No, I'm not.

24:07.874 --> 24:10.241
But it's the only way I see us
getting a little breathing room,

24:10.243 --> 24:13.144
and I'd rather cross my own line
than sign their dotted one.

24:13.146 --> 24:14.412
Okay.

24:14.414 --> 24:15.747
Then it looks
like I have a date

24:15.749 --> 24:18.583
with your girlfriend
in the morning.

24:23.289 --> 24:26.591
[Elevator bell dings]

24:55.187 --> 24:56.688
Weren't you supposed
to be announced?

24:56.690 --> 24:58.890
I don't play
by those rules.

24:58.892 --> 25:01.159
Hmm. Somehow
that doesn't surprise me.

25:01.161 --> 25:02.260
What are you...

25:02.262 --> 25:03.961
Doing here?
You're not Scottie.

25:03.963 --> 25:06.297
And you're not Jimmy Smits,
but we make do.

25:06.299 --> 25:08.099
Are you making
an <i>L.A. Law</i> reference?

25:08.101 --> 25:10.568
No, I'm saying I wish
I had a date with Jimmy Smits.

25:10.570 --> 25:12.737
- Ah.
- But instead I'm here...

25:12.739 --> 25:14.972
To tell you that Edward's
in another league.

25:14.974 --> 25:16.040
You're going to lose.

25:16.042 --> 25:17.075
Well, there's
only one problem.

25:17.077 --> 25:18.743
Words are coming
out of your mouth,

25:18.745 --> 25:20.445
which means
the real story isn't.

25:20.447 --> 25:21.579
Okay, you want
the real story?

25:21.581 --> 25:22.947
Your clients
are running out of funds.

25:22.949 --> 25:24.949
You have a window.
To do what?

25:24.951 --> 25:27.185
- Give up.
- [Chuckles]

25:27.187 --> 25:29.620
No, I don't think
that's going to cut it for us.

25:29.622 --> 25:30.755
Why not?

25:30.757 --> 25:32.056
Because...

25:32.058 --> 25:33.691
We have this.

25:33.693 --> 25:36.594
[File thuds]

25:36.596 --> 25:39.530
Harvey, we still have
to work together after this.

25:39.532 --> 25:40.665
I am giving you
a way out.

25:40.667 --> 25:42.100
We can still both
be name partners.

25:42.102 --> 25:43.101
No, we can't.

25:43.103 --> 25:45.036
I made a deal
with Jessica.

25:45.038 --> 25:46.304
I win, you're out.

25:46.306 --> 25:47.505
I give up,

25:47.507 --> 25:50.375
you're going to be name partner
all by yourself.

25:52.378 --> 25:55.480
That's not
what I want.

25:55.482 --> 25:57.215
Harvey, don't you get it?
Wait a second.

25:57.217 --> 25:59.751
If you're here,
who the hell's in with Mike?

26:03.088 --> 26:06.524
Get out.

26:10.929 --> 26:12.430
You're angry.

26:12.432 --> 26:14.966
This isn't funny, Harvey.
You just broke the law.

26:14.968 --> 26:17.235
It's a civil law.
No one's going to go to jail.

26:17.237 --> 26:19.437
Justify it all you want,
but you cheated.

26:19.439 --> 26:21.272
Like you,
subbing in for Scottie?

26:21.274 --> 26:23.307
I see
what you're doing.

26:23.309 --> 26:26.310
You know damn well
Darby plays by the rules.

26:26.312 --> 26:28.413
So if you win by cheating,
you win.

26:28.415 --> 26:30.515
And if you lose,
then they think you're dirty,

26:30.517 --> 26:31.816
and they won't want
to merge.

26:31.818 --> 26:33.151
You really want to merge
with a man

26:33.153 --> 26:34.585
who's asking
for your help to win?

26:34.587 --> 26:35.787
He didn't ask.

26:35.789 --> 26:36.954
I insisted.

26:36.956 --> 26:38.556
On being
his number two.

26:38.558 --> 26:40.491
I guess that's a preview
of things to come.

26:40.493 --> 26:42.693
And is that little stunt
you pulled

26:42.695 --> 26:44.495
a preview
of things to come?

26:44.497 --> 26:47.899
Holt, Zane, Hardman--
we just fought them off.

26:47.901 --> 26:51.302
We won. We're strong.
We've got money.

26:51.304 --> 26:53.771
And if we do this,
we go to the next level.

26:53.773 --> 26:56.641
We'll be the biggest,
baddest fish in the sea.

26:56.643 --> 26:59.577
Those three names
you mentioned--fleas.

26:59.579 --> 27:03.347
Not only can't they bully us,
they can't touch us.

27:03.349 --> 27:05.349
And what's going to happen
after I beat Darby?

27:05.351 --> 27:06.818
You think
I'm playing with you?

27:06.820 --> 27:09.554
That stunt you pulled--
fruit from the poison tree.

27:09.556 --> 27:11.055
I will have that reversed
on Tuesday.

27:11.057 --> 27:12.557
You think I'm not going
to find anything

27:12.559 --> 27:13.758
between now and Tuesday?

27:13.760 --> 27:15.460
- I know you won't.
- Is that a threat?

27:15.462 --> 27:17.728
It's a prediction.

27:19.598 --> 27:22.233
I can go.

27:22.235 --> 27:23.935
Where you going to go?

27:23.937 --> 27:25.336
Hmm?

27:25.338 --> 27:26.737
Even if I let you out,

27:26.739 --> 27:29.974
it's the same out there,
only worse.

27:29.976 --> 27:32.477
And you'll be a winner,
but not a leader,

27:32.479 --> 27:33.611
and you won't have me.

27:33.613 --> 27:35.446
You don't know
these people.

27:35.448 --> 27:38.683
I know they said
I couldn't control you.

27:38.685 --> 27:41.519
You're going to learn
that I can.

27:58.596 --> 28:00.029
The merger
hasn't gone through yet,

28:00.031 --> 28:01.331
so technically,

28:01.333 --> 28:03.433
you're not allowed to be lurking
around our files.

28:03.435 --> 28:06.436
I'm not lurking.
I'm looking for you.

28:06.438 --> 28:08.238
And here I am.

28:08.240 --> 28:10.573
I think
that you lied to me.

28:10.575 --> 28:12.242
I think
that you're wrong.

28:12.244 --> 28:14.010
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

28:14.012 --> 28:15.311
I know I'm not a liar.

28:15.313 --> 28:17.814
You told me you never said
a bad thing about me.

28:17.816 --> 28:18.848
And I never have.

28:18.850 --> 28:21.618
But you don't like me.

28:21.620 --> 28:24.153
I don't like people
who lie to Harvey.

28:24.155 --> 28:28.424
Are you in love
with him, Donna?

28:28.426 --> 28:30.994
I am so frickin' tired
of people asking me that,

28:30.996 --> 28:34.864
and it is none
of your business.

28:34.866 --> 28:37.934
But, no.

28:37.936 --> 28:39.435
And I did like you,

28:39.437 --> 28:42.071
until you walked in here
with that bullshit agenda and--

28:42.073 --> 28:43.139
It's not bullshit.

28:43.141 --> 28:46.676
Okay, then what
would you call it?

28:46.678 --> 28:49.479
Why do you think
I came back last time?

28:49.481 --> 28:51.514
Why do you think
I brought us in on Folsom?

28:51.516 --> 28:53.349
I don't know
how to get his attention

28:53.351 --> 28:55.351
unless I sue him.

28:55.353 --> 28:57.320
You're in love
with him.

28:57.322 --> 29:01.157
He's
he's just so angry at me,

29:01.159 --> 29:03.426
and I-I don't know
how to make him believe it.

29:03.428 --> 29:04.861
Well, why would he
believe you?

29:04.863 --> 29:06.963
All you've ever done
is lie to him.

29:06.965 --> 29:09.399
This is not...

29:09.401 --> 29:10.900
This is not a lie.

29:10.902 --> 29:14.637
Look, Dana, if you want
to break through his anger,

29:14.639 --> 29:17.740
you're going to have
to do something.

29:20.311 --> 29:21.377
The merger.

29:21.379 --> 29:23.379
Walk away.

29:23.381 --> 29:25.214
[Scoffs]
From my name on the door.

29:25.216 --> 29:26.883
If you want him
to hear you,

29:26.885 --> 29:28.785
you're going to have to make
a sacrifice.

29:28.787 --> 29:31.220
So I just...

29:31.222 --> 29:34.457
Risk everything
with no guarantee.

29:34.459 --> 29:37.427
That's what sacrifice is.

29:46.837 --> 29:49.072
I got your message.

29:49.074 --> 29:50.406
Why are we meeting here?

29:50.408 --> 29:51.975
You sound like
you don't trust me.

29:51.977 --> 29:54.177
Well, you did sandbag me
with Jessica.

29:54.179 --> 29:55.979
Jessica sandbagged you
with Jessica.

29:55.981 --> 29:59.248
Still doesn't explain
why we're meeting here.

30:01.251 --> 30:02.618
Baby Harvey.

30:02.620 --> 30:05.154
[Scoffs]
That's a huge compliment.

30:05.156 --> 30:07.190
- Call it like I see it.
- I meant for him.

30:07.192 --> 30:11.260
Like I said,
baby Harvey.

30:11.262 --> 30:13.096
[Clears throat]

30:13.098 --> 30:16.766
We're meeting here because you
will never find this.

30:21.772 --> 30:23.840
If this checks out,
it'll win the case for us.

30:23.842 --> 30:26.609
I know.

30:26.611 --> 30:29.579
And why am I the one
you're giving this to?

30:29.581 --> 30:30.947
Because there are
some things in life

30:30.949 --> 30:32.582
more important than winning.

30:32.584 --> 30:35.051
That's not
what I asked.

30:35.053 --> 30:38.554
Why are you
giving it to me?

30:38.556 --> 30:40.823
When we were
in law school,

30:40.825 --> 30:43.326
Harvey's brother
got sick.

30:43.328 --> 30:45.561
He needed money.
His father didn't have any.

30:45.563 --> 30:47.030
His mother
wasn't in the picture.

30:47.032 --> 30:48.064
Don't tell me.

30:48.066 --> 30:49.832
Harvey found a way
to help him out.

30:49.834 --> 30:50.967
He used his tuition.

30:50.969 --> 30:53.903
Anyway...

30:53.905 --> 30:57.106
When his mother found out,
she contacted him.

30:57.108 --> 30:58.708
Harvey wouldn't take a nickel
from her.

30:58.710 --> 31:00.877
So she gave his brother
the money.

31:00.879 --> 31:02.779
Who used it
to pay him back.

31:02.781 --> 31:04.947
I didn't even know
Harvey had a brother.

31:04.949 --> 31:06.749
You'd like him.

31:06.751 --> 31:08.751
He's like you.

31:11.855 --> 31:14.057
So are you saying
that I have to tell Harvey

31:14.059 --> 31:15.758
I found this on my own?

31:15.760 --> 31:18.628
You don't have to.

31:18.630 --> 31:22.999
But it'll definitely increase
your odds of him using it.

31:24.668 --> 31:26.602
- I found something.
- Let me see.

31:26.604 --> 31:28.237
It's not done.
We have to hurry.

31:28.239 --> 31:29.772
But I can get it done
before tomorrow morning.

31:29.774 --> 31:31.274
This is good.

31:31.276 --> 31:33.009
I know.

31:33.011 --> 31:35.878
Get on it.
Where'd you get it?

31:37.514 --> 31:38.648
You know where I got it.

31:38.650 --> 31:41.117
The question is,
are you going to let me use it?

31:41.119 --> 31:43.686
- Get out.
- Harvey, we can win with this.

31:43.688 --> 31:45.855
Here's what you don't get.
You can't trust her.

31:45.857 --> 31:47.056
If it came from her,

31:47.058 --> 31:48.624
it'll come back to bite us
in the ass.

31:48.626 --> 31:51.027
Tomorrow morning is coming,
and we don't have anything else.

31:51.029 --> 31:54.330
- Then go find me something.
- Okay.

31:57.234 --> 31:58.601
Pardon me.
Excuse me.

31:58.603 --> 32:00.236
Do you mind
if I have a little more lemon?

32:00.238 --> 32:02.238
Thanks.

32:06.643 --> 32:07.710
You were at the show?

32:07.712 --> 32:09.345
Seat 4-A.
You?

32:09.347 --> 32:13.149
Seat A-4.
Shakespeare well performed.

32:13.151 --> 32:14.684
Indeed...

32:14.686 --> 32:15.685
Though not improved

32:15.687 --> 32:17.520
by the yammering
of that battle axe.

32:17.522 --> 32:19.589
Well, thank God she stopped
after the first act.

32:19.591 --> 32:20.656
Thank you.

32:20.658 --> 32:24.861
Well, she didn't
precisely stop.

32:24.863 --> 32:26.062
You had her removed?

32:26.064 --> 32:27.697
Told her
the baby-sitter phoned,

32:27.699 --> 32:29.866
and the children were
on fire.

32:29.868 --> 32:31.033
What's that?

32:31.035 --> 32:33.536
One row up--
some douche bag was texting.

32:33.538 --> 32:36.372
Took it from him,
didn't even know.

32:36.374 --> 32:39.175
Oh, uh, please.

32:42.346 --> 32:44.547
Incidentally, excellent use
of the word "douche bag."

32:44.549 --> 32:46.415
Well, I've had a lot
of experience with them.

32:46.417 --> 32:47.917
As have I.

32:47.919 --> 32:50.586
I don't make friends
very easily.

32:50.588 --> 32:52.088
That's funny.

32:52.090 --> 32:54.724
When I was a kid...

32:54.726 --> 32:56.592
There was a bunch
of them.

32:56.594 --> 32:59.128
And, uh, every day
there was something new,

32:59.130 --> 33:00.129
meaner and meaner.

33:00.131 --> 33:02.131
Most of them
were just followers,

33:02.133 --> 33:05.535
but there was that one--
Kirk Breslin.

33:05.537 --> 33:06.802
Julian Hunt.

33:06.804 --> 33:10.640
And then one day
I decided to be mean.

33:10.642 --> 33:12.808
I just told
that bully piece of shit

33:12.810 --> 33:14.377
that he'd never be anything,
do anything,

33:14.379 --> 33:16.479
or amount to anything.

33:16.481 --> 33:18.080
After that, they never made fun
of me again.

33:18.082 --> 33:20.850
In fact, they, uh...

33:20.852 --> 33:25.488
They never talked
to me again.

33:25.490 --> 33:28.691
Right.

33:28.693 --> 33:31.727
I shouldn't have impugned
Baden-Baden.

33:31.729 --> 33:34.263
It's just that when I asked you
if you took mud,

33:34.265 --> 33:36.332
I was...

33:36.334 --> 33:41.003
Offering a warm,
muddied hand of friendship,

33:41.005 --> 33:44.640
and you took that hand
and wiped it clean.

33:44.642 --> 33:46.943
Well, I didn't recognize
the gesture.

33:46.945 --> 33:48.177
I understand.

33:48.179 --> 33:50.446
It's a lonely job,
being the hatchet man.

33:50.448 --> 33:53.849
Yeah, well, I guess
it's, uh, our cross to bear.

33:53.851 --> 33:55.851
Hmm.

33:59.356 --> 34:01.357
Can I be honest
with you?

34:01.359 --> 34:03.192
With the results
of my efficiency list,

34:03.194 --> 34:05.628
I keep arriving
at the same conclusion.

34:05.630 --> 34:07.863
There's no room
for both of us.

34:07.865 --> 34:11.534
[Sighs] Unless...

34:11.536 --> 34:14.203
We made room
for each other.

34:17.373 --> 34:19.809
I leave you
off my list.

34:19.811 --> 34:22.612
And I leave you
off mine.

34:22.614 --> 34:23.813
Well,
would you be willing

34:23.815 --> 34:25.915
to sacrifice the integrity
of your list?

34:25.917 --> 34:28.451
[Sighs]

34:28.453 --> 34:31.454
I would...

34:31.456 --> 34:33.623
For a friend.

34:46.203 --> 34:47.837
What the hell
is wrong with you?

34:47.839 --> 34:49.972
I have a feeling
you're about to tell me.

34:49.974 --> 34:52.308
Are you for this merger
or against it?

34:52.310 --> 34:53.809
I'm against it.

34:53.811 --> 34:54.909
Why?
Never mind.

34:54.911 --> 34:56.545
I'm going
to tell you why--

34:56.547 --> 34:57.847
because of Scottie.

34:57.849 --> 35:01.017
If I can't trust her,
how can I trust any of it?

35:01.019 --> 35:03.953
She's showing you you can
by throwing it all away.

35:03.955 --> 35:07.189
That folder
is a wild-goose chase.

35:07.191 --> 35:09.492
Oh, my God. For somebody
who's usually three steps ahead,

35:09.494 --> 35:10.926
you are a mile behind.

35:10.928 --> 35:12.662
She is in love
with you, Harvey...

35:12.664 --> 35:15.097
Only she
can't tell you that

35:15.099 --> 35:16.732
because she,
like everybody else,

35:16.734 --> 35:18.701
knows that it will only
drive you away.

35:18.703 --> 35:20.136
- Donna.
- If she had shown up here

35:20.138 --> 35:21.704
and asked you
to start a relationship,

35:21.706 --> 35:24.273
would you have said yes?

35:24.275 --> 35:27.276
No, you wouldn't have.
It's not that simple.

35:27.278 --> 35:28.577
Was it not that simple
with Zoe?

35:28.579 --> 35:29.745
What the hell
does that have to do with it?

35:29.747 --> 35:30.980
You let her go.

35:30.982 --> 35:33.316
She left me
to raise her niece.

35:33.318 --> 35:35.851
- Did you ask her to stay?
- It wasn't on the table.

35:35.853 --> 35:37.153
She wanted you to fight.

35:37.155 --> 35:39.689
That poor girl
was losing her father,

35:39.691 --> 35:41.724
and I wasn't about to try
and replace him

35:41.726 --> 35:42.725
while it was happening.

35:42.727 --> 35:44.627
Bullshit!
You let her go!

35:44.629 --> 35:47.530
And I am so sick
of watching you fight like hell

35:47.532 --> 35:49.198
for everything
that happens in here

35:49.200 --> 35:51.067
and nothing
that happens in here.

35:51.069 --> 35:52.868
- Is this about Zoe?
- No.

35:52.870 --> 35:53.903
Is this about you?

35:53.905 --> 35:56.472
No.

35:56.474 --> 36:00.142
This is about Scottie.

36:00.144 --> 36:01.677
You don't know
what she did.

36:01.679 --> 36:03.779
I do know
what she did.

36:03.781 --> 36:05.981
She cheated on her fiance,
so you think that that means

36:05.983 --> 36:07.483
that there
will always be a chance

36:07.485 --> 36:08.684
that she will cheat on you.

36:08.686 --> 36:10.820
The difference is,
she didn't love him.

36:10.822 --> 36:14.423
She loves you.

36:14.425 --> 36:17.893
Look, I know
that your mother hurt you,

36:17.895 --> 36:19.662
but you need
to get over it.

36:19.664 --> 36:22.531
You think
that's what I'm worried about?

36:22.533 --> 36:25.101
She made me
make a fool out of him,

36:25.103 --> 36:26.369
a man I'd never met,

36:26.371 --> 36:29.939
a man who'd never done
a wrong to me.

36:29.941 --> 36:31.440
How am I going
to trust someone

36:31.442 --> 36:34.577
who made me a man
who did that?

36:34.579 --> 36:37.113
Maybe you
can't trust her.

36:37.115 --> 36:39.448
But if you want to end
this merger,

36:39.450 --> 36:42.551
you better trust
what she gave Mike.

36:51.561 --> 36:55.865
Give him the file.

36:55.867 --> 37:00.136
What do you think
I did four hours ago?

37:03.740 --> 37:05.541
You wanted
to see me?

37:05.543 --> 37:07.543
That request went out
two hours ago.

37:07.545 --> 37:09.278
Uh, yeah, I was
in the middle of something.

37:09.280 --> 37:10.480
What were you
in the middle of?

37:10.481 --> 37:12.214
Excuse me?

37:12.216 --> 37:14.183
You said you were
in the middle of something.

37:14.185 --> 37:15.651
I assume
it's Harvey's case.

37:15.653 --> 37:17.420
I can't tell you that.
You're on the other side.

37:17.422 --> 37:18.654
Is there some rule

37:18.656 --> 37:22.224
against my checking
on my own employee?

37:25.762 --> 37:28.864
I'm confident that,
after tomorrow,

37:28.866 --> 37:30.433
you'll either settle
or lose.

37:30.435 --> 37:32.101
And why is that?

37:32.103 --> 37:33.602
Because I've prepared
a motion

37:33.604 --> 37:35.471
based on a file
dated September 14th.

37:35.473 --> 37:37.440
Darby didn't tell me
about that.

37:37.442 --> 37:39.308
He didn't know about it.

37:39.310 --> 37:41.610
Where'd you get it?

37:41.612 --> 37:43.312
[Sighs]

37:43.314 --> 37:44.647
Hmm.

37:44.649 --> 37:47.416
What does it say?

37:47.418 --> 37:50.453
It says
you're going to lose.

37:50.455 --> 37:52.755
Then that's too bad...

37:52.757 --> 37:56.759
Because you're going
to throw it away.

37:56.761 --> 37:59.195
- What?
- You heard me.

37:59.197 --> 38:00.429
You're going to go home.

38:00.431 --> 38:02.932
You don't call,
you don't answer,

38:02.934 --> 38:05.601
and you don't come back
until that deadline is passed.

38:05.603 --> 38:07.169
Wait a minute.
These are your clients.

38:07.171 --> 38:08.571
Who Harvey is using.

38:08.573 --> 38:12.208
- That's a bullshit argument.
- And so is that file.

38:15.111 --> 38:16.312
- I won't.
- You will.

38:16.314 --> 38:17.580
Harvey will never
forgive me.

38:17.582 --> 38:20.082
Right now your problem
isn't with Harvey.

38:20.084 --> 38:22.084
Your problem is with me.

38:22.086 --> 38:23.319
You don't do this,

38:23.321 --> 38:25.721
who's to say
you don't end up in a cell

38:25.723 --> 38:28.724
for practicing law
without a degree?

38:32.762 --> 38:34.630
And who's to say you don't
share that cell with me

38:34.632 --> 38:36.298
for knowing about it
the whole time?

38:36.300 --> 38:37.867
You don't want
to take that tact.

38:37.869 --> 38:39.835
- I didn't start it.
- I will beat you.

38:39.837 --> 38:41.136
The last time
you said that to me,

38:41.138 --> 38:43.339
you thought
you didn't need a computer.

38:43.341 --> 38:44.473
You were wrong.

38:44.475 --> 38:46.275
That was
about demonstrating knowledge,

38:46.277 --> 38:48.310
and the stakes
were nothing.

38:48.312 --> 38:50.479
This is
about my power,

38:50.481 --> 38:54.350
and the stakes
are everything.

38:54.352 --> 38:56.285
This is a letter
to the district attorney,

38:56.287 --> 38:58.621
saying that it's come
to my attention

38:58.623 --> 39:01.123
that you are breaking
the law.

39:01.125 --> 39:02.558
I believe you've met him--

39:02.560 --> 39:05.761
not the type
to let it slide.

39:07.631 --> 39:10.766
You file your motion...

39:10.768 --> 39:12.434
I'll file mine.

39:27.236 --> 39:29.803
[Footsteps approaching]

39:29.805 --> 39:31.838
Okay, look, Harvey--
shut your mouth!

39:31.840 --> 39:33.473
I risked everything
for you.

39:33.475 --> 39:35.475
Then I did it again
and again.

39:35.477 --> 39:37.677
- Wait. You weren't there.
- I didn't have to be.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.012
- Jessica--
- You don't work for Jessica.

39:39.014 --> 39:40.013
You work for me.

39:40.015 --> 39:41.314
I know I do,

39:41.316 --> 39:43.083
but I was just trying
to get you what you wanted--

39:43.085 --> 39:44.551
your name on the door.

39:44.553 --> 39:46.219
No, you got
Edward Darby's name on the door.

39:46.221 --> 39:48.088
My part of the deal
is gone.

39:48.090 --> 39:50.357
What?
You never told me that.

39:50.359 --> 39:52.325
I didn't think I needed
to tell you that

39:52.327 --> 39:54.795
because I didn't think
you would ever betray me.

39:54.797 --> 39:56.496
Harvey,
look at what we've done--

39:56.498 --> 39:58.298
you and me.

39:58.300 --> 39:59.866
You broke
the Chinese wall.

39:59.868 --> 40:02.135
I got information
directly from Scottie.

40:02.137 --> 40:04.704
That's two ethical violations
that six weeks ago

40:04.706 --> 40:06.206
would have made
your stomach turn.

40:06.208 --> 40:07.707
- That's not why you did it.
- Fine.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.110
But look me in the eye and
tell me it's not true anyway.

40:10.112 --> 40:11.678
You know what,
it doesn't matter

40:11.680 --> 40:14.614
because you don't get to make
my decisions for me.

40:14.616 --> 40:17.851
Isn't that what you
were trying to do for me?

40:17.853 --> 40:19.553
This is
a private conversation.

40:19.555 --> 40:21.721
You want to have it out,
let's have it out...

40:21.723 --> 40:23.256
right now.

40:23.258 --> 40:25.392
You might want
to go.

40:27.495 --> 40:29.429
I'm sorry.

40:29.431 --> 40:30.897
You're back
in the associates' pool.

40:30.899 --> 40:32.566
Harvey, come on.

40:32.568 --> 40:34.568
Turns out you're not
the best lawyer I've ever seen.

40:34.570 --> 40:35.869
In fact,
you're fired.

40:35.871 --> 40:37.737
No, he's not.

40:37.739 --> 40:39.873
Oh, you going to overrule me
on that too?

40:39.875 --> 40:42.075
You can go.

40:47.381 --> 40:50.016
I didn't overrule you
on the other.

40:50.018 --> 40:51.718
I beat you
fair and square.

40:51.720 --> 40:54.421
- No, you didn't.
- You're right.

40:54.423 --> 40:56.756
I cheated, like you.

40:56.758 --> 40:59.359
You jumped
to the other side.

40:59.361 --> 41:01.695
You put me
on the other side.

41:01.697 --> 41:03.597
I had a deal

41:03.599 --> 41:06.867
that put your name
right next to mine.

41:06.869 --> 41:08.501
And it wasn't even
up there yet,

41:08.503 --> 41:10.437
and you started acting
like it was on top of mine.

41:10.439 --> 41:12.706
- To protect you.
- Bullshit.

41:12.708 --> 41:14.007
This wasn't
about protecting me.

41:14.009 --> 41:15.542
This was
about advancing you.

41:15.544 --> 41:17.110
That's what this whole thing
is about.

41:17.112 --> 41:18.411
What?

41:18.413 --> 41:19.980
Hardman said it.
I didn't think it was true.

41:19.982 --> 41:22.048
He said
you don't trust me.

41:22.050 --> 41:25.185
He meant
you're afraid of me.

41:25.187 --> 41:28.421
Afraid of you?

41:28.423 --> 41:30.824
Boy,
I just kicked your ass.

41:30.826 --> 41:32.826
And you didn't
just want it.

41:32.828 --> 41:35.729
You begged me for it.

41:35.731 --> 41:39.666
So now you're going
to stay here,

41:39.668 --> 41:41.668
be humble,

41:41.670 --> 41:44.170
and learn
your goddamn place.

43:05.219 --> 43:08.421
[Elevator bell dings]

43:10.224 --> 43:12.025
You could have just told me
that you didn't love me

43:12.027 --> 43:13.626
instead of selling me out.

43:13.628 --> 43:15.562
I didn't sell you out,
Scottie.

43:15.564 --> 43:17.197
Well, somebody did

43:17.199 --> 43:18.932
because Darby found out
what I gave Mike,

43:18.934 --> 43:22.235
and I just got fired.

43:22.237 --> 43:25.171
It wasn't me.

43:25.173 --> 43:26.840
Well...

43:26.842 --> 43:30.577
At least there's that.

43:30.579 --> 43:33.279
Good-bye, Harvey.

44:00.674 --> 44:03.309
And then
we just toasted to it,

44:03.311 --> 44:06.679
one hatchet man
to the other.

44:06.681 --> 44:07.914
Wow, Louis.

44:07.916 --> 44:11.117
That's the sweetest story
I've ever heard.

44:12.920 --> 44:14.754
- I broke my word.
- What?

44:14.756 --> 44:16.589
I put him on the list,
and I handed it in.

44:16.591 --> 44:17.791
How could you do that?

44:17.793 --> 44:19.659
I realized I couldn't do that
to my list.

44:19.661 --> 44:21.027
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself,

44:21.029 --> 44:23.096
which means
he couldn't either.

44:23.098 --> 44:25.098
Yes, he could.

44:25.100 --> 44:26.166
Meaning?

44:26.168 --> 44:29.169
He didn't put you
on his list.

44:33.307 --> 44:34.374
I have
to do something.

44:34.376 --> 44:36.142
You can't.
It's too late.

44:36.144 --> 44:39.345
Not that.

44:39.347 --> 44:40.847
I couldn't be a good friend
to Nigel,

44:40.849 --> 44:42.682
but I could've been a good
friend to Rachel, and I wasn't.

44:42.684 --> 44:43.850
What are you
talking about?

44:43.852 --> 44:45.585
I missed the deadline
to tell her something,

44:45.587 --> 44:49.022
but I can still try
to make it right.

44:54.328 --> 44:56.996
- I'm a man of my word.
- Huh.

44:56.998 --> 44:59.399
And what word is that?

44:59.401 --> 45:01.768
I'm here to officially
welcome you to the firm

45:01.770 --> 45:02.769
with open arms.

45:02.771 --> 45:04.704
I'm not
much of a hugger.

45:04.706 --> 45:06.906
Good.

45:14.315 --> 45:16.716
One more thing--
Jessica was wrong.

45:16.718 --> 45:18.451
Scottie didn't give me
anything.

45:18.453 --> 45:20.787
I took it.

45:20.789 --> 45:22.322
You say you're a man
of your word,

45:22.324 --> 45:24.991
yet you're lying
for her.

45:26.794 --> 45:27.794
I am.

45:27.796 --> 45:29.629
Honorable nonetheless.

45:29.631 --> 45:32.065
What would you have me do?
Give her her job back.

45:32.067 --> 45:34.067
What reason
would I have to do that?

45:34.069 --> 45:35.702
Whatever she did,

45:35.704 --> 45:38.805
you wouldn't have this merger
without her.

45:38.807 --> 45:40.707
Fair enough.

45:40.709 --> 45:43.877
Would you have her work here
or in London?

45:56.957 --> 45:58.825
Rachel, look, I'm sorry,
but I am not--

45:58.827 --> 46:02.128
When did you send
that letter?

46:02.130 --> 46:03.329
Um, I was, uh--

46:03.331 --> 46:05.198
I'll tell you when--
never.

46:05.200 --> 46:09.035
Okay, look,
let me explain.

46:09.037 --> 46:10.336
When I went
to see Louis,

46:10.338 --> 46:11.771
he told me
what really happened--

46:11.773 --> 46:13.940
I know.
He told me too.

46:13.942 --> 46:15.542
And I get it.
I'm not good enough.

46:15.544 --> 46:17.644
What I don't get, Mike, is why
you didn't have the courage

46:17.646 --> 46:18.978
to just come
and tell me that yourself.

46:18.980 --> 46:20.413
Look,
he lied to you.

46:20.415 --> 46:23.049
I thought he deserved a chance
to tell you himself, all right?

46:23.051 --> 46:25.151
When I went to his office
to get him to sign the letter--

46:25.153 --> 46:26.519
Wait.

46:26.521 --> 46:29.455
You went to him
to sign the letter?

46:29.457 --> 46:31.391
You told me you were going
to sign the letter.

46:31.393 --> 46:32.992
- No--
- No, so you lied to me.

46:32.994 --> 46:34.561
No, I didn't. I told you
that I would help you.

46:34.563 --> 46:36.162
That is such bullshit!

46:36.164 --> 46:37.797
That's not what you meant,
and you know it.

46:37.799 --> 46:39.065
You've been cagey
with me

46:39.067 --> 46:40.600
since the second I came to you
about the letter,

46:40.602 --> 46:41.935
and you're being cagey
with me right now.

46:41.937 --> 46:42.969
You are.
You're lying to me.

46:42.971 --> 46:44.170
Not today, Rachel.

46:44.172 --> 46:45.238
Please, stop.
Then what day, Mike?

46:45.240 --> 46:46.606
Because it's
always something.

46:46.608 --> 46:49.609
It is always some secret
or some story or some lie--

46:49.611 --> 46:51.110
- You don't understand--
- I don't understand what?

46:51.112 --> 46:52.979
You don't understand
what I have been through!

46:52.981 --> 46:56.015
You don't understand
what I have lost!

46:56.017 --> 46:58.885
Because it's everything,
everyone that I love--

46:58.887 --> 47:00.887
Trevor, my grandmother,
Harvey,

47:00.889 --> 47:02.188
now, probably this job!

47:02.190 --> 47:06.359
I am not ready
to lose you...

47:08.128 --> 47:10.463
Not today!

47:10.465 --> 47:13.199
Then tell me.

47:25.946 --> 47:29.382
I never went
to Harvard.

47:32.920 --> 47:35.088
What?

47:35.090 --> 47:37.690
I'm a fraud.

47:40.995 --> 47:44.464
