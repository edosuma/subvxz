WEBVTT

00:01.768 --> 00:05.170
Today we show you
how to build a man's bed.

00:05.171 --> 00:07.172
We'll be using materials

00:07.173 --> 00:09.574
That make a man feel
all warm and toasty inside -

00:09.575 --> 00:13.011
Cold, hard steel.

00:13.012 --> 00:16.548
That's right.
We'll be cutting that steel
with the binford 6100 chop saw.

00:16.549 --> 00:19.350
She's a beauty, isn't she?
14-inch cut-off blade.

00:19.351 --> 00:21.352
Make sure your steel
is fastened securely.

00:21.353 --> 00:24.489
Use a smooth pull,
makes for a smooth cut.

00:24.490 --> 00:27.259
Now, this is the steel
for our headboard
and frame rails.

00:27.260 --> 00:29.828
And this is the backup steel
for when tim screws up.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.932
Have a little faith, al.

00:39.005 --> 00:41.907
All right, well,
here are the two equal
side rails tim cut.

00:45.144 --> 00:48.447
Luckily, I cut some
side rails earlier.

00:48.448 --> 00:51.048
Now we gotta weld our flanges
to our frame rails.

00:51.049 --> 00:53.050
I love welding.

00:53.051 --> 00:54.485
You might say...

00:54.486 --> 00:58.422
I carry a torch for it.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

00:58.423 --> 01:01.059
We finished our frame.
We're gonna attach it
to the headboard.

01:01.060 --> 01:03.795
And to form our design,
we'll be using
the binford 6100 bender.

01:03.796 --> 01:06.197
Do you suppose
they call this a bender

01:06.198 --> 01:08.600
Because it's been out
partying all weekend?

01:08.601 --> 01:12.637
Party. Oww. Oww.

01:14.540 --> 01:16.541
I don't think so, tim.

01:16.542 --> 01:19.410
The bender allows us
to form our headboard

01:19.411 --> 01:21.446
Into any manly pattern
that we choose.

01:21.447 --> 01:24.148
A moose, a beer mug,
jockstrap.

01:24.149 --> 01:28.419
A moose holding a beer mug
wearing a jockstrap.

01:28.420 --> 01:29.654
We've chosen -

01:29.655 --> 01:32.256
Doesn't matter
what we've chosen.

01:32.257 --> 01:35.393
Let's face it, men -
no matter what design
we put on the bed,

01:35.394 --> 01:38.262
Once your wife
gets ahold of it,
it will look like this...

01:39.098 --> 01:42.033
Men, it's time
we fight back.

01:42.034 --> 01:44.402
We've got to de-frill,
de-lace,

01:44.403 --> 01:48.072
De-froufrou
de bedroom.

01:48.073 --> 01:50.375
That's why next time
on <i>tool time,</i>

01:50.376 --> 01:55.313
We'll show you how a man
designs his sleeping quarters
and why it's called...

01:55.314 --> 01:57.081
<i>(both)</i> the master bedroom.

02:50.702 --> 02:52.970
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, mom.

02:52.971 --> 02:56.441
When I was at the mall,
I picked up some shirts for you.
See if you like them.

02:56.442 --> 02:58.109
I don't like them.

03:00.646 --> 03:02.847
You haven't even
looked at them.

03:06.285 --> 03:08.720
Hate it.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.089
Hate it.

03:11.090 --> 03:13.124
Really hate it.

03:15.494 --> 03:19.631
I don't care what anybody says,
you're still my son.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.301
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, dad.

03:24.637 --> 03:26.071
Hi, honey.

03:26.072 --> 03:28.806
What is
that smile about?

03:28.807 --> 03:30.275
Mm-mmm.

03:31.710 --> 03:34.379
Are you planning
something sexy
for us tonight,

03:34.380 --> 03:37.382
Or have you
been welding?

03:37.383 --> 03:38.917
I've been welding.

03:38.918 --> 03:41.286
Hi, mom, dad.
Hi, sweetie.
How was your day?

03:41.287 --> 03:43.621
Unbelievably excellent.
You were welding?

03:46.892 --> 03:49.060
No. I got an "a"
on my english test.

03:49.061 --> 03:50.562
All right.

03:50.563 --> 03:53.231
Great! I told you,
you could do it.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.600
I'm real proud of you.
All your hard work pays off.
This is the second "a."

03:55.601 --> 03:57.602
This is really good news.

03:57.603 --> 03:59.771
Last year, the only "a"
I got stood for "absent."

03:59.772 --> 04:01.238
Yeah.

04:02.507 --> 04:05.377
<i>(brad)</i> hi, randy.
Hi. You're a little late.

04:05.378 --> 04:07.646
Yeah, I got kept after school
for detention.

04:07.647 --> 04:10.015
<i>(all)</i> you?

04:10.016 --> 04:13.685
Mr. Moreno
wants to see you guys
about it.

04:13.686 --> 04:15.152
Mr. Moreno?

04:15.153 --> 04:17.555
He's that science teacher.
We met him at the open house.

04:17.555 --> 04:19.923
What'd he say?
None of your business.

04:19.925 --> 04:21.959
He's also
my guidance counselor.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.395
He says I've been
goofing off in class.

04:24.396 --> 04:26.831
This isn't like you at all.
What's going on?

04:26.832 --> 04:29.467
Nothing.
Bad answer.

04:29.468 --> 04:31.303
I would have gone with,

04:31.304 --> 04:34.306
"it wasn't my fault.
It was the kid next to me."

04:34.307 --> 04:36.808
That never worked for me.
I was the kid next to me.

04:39.645 --> 04:42.681
Randy, teachers
don't give detention
for nothing.

04:42.682 --> 04:45.383
Actually, they do.
It's a new program.
Just started.

04:45.384 --> 04:47.251
Randy.

04:47.252 --> 04:50.522
What's the big deal?
Brad always gets detention
all the time.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.223
I'm not getting detention
anymore.

04:52.224 --> 04:55.894
I just got my second straight
"a" in english. <i>Of mice and men.</i>

04:55.895 --> 04:57.929
Ha-ha.

04:57.930 --> 05:00.298
Finally teaching
pest control in school.
That's good.

05:06.271 --> 05:09.107
All right, science class.

05:09.108 --> 05:11.242
Oh, I remember this smell.

05:13.412 --> 05:15.346
Formaldehyde and frog guts.

05:16.916 --> 05:20.151
<i>(gruff voice)</i> I love frog guts.
How about you? Yeah, yeah.

05:22.187 --> 05:25.990
Would you look at the size
of the liver on this guy.

05:25.991 --> 05:29.627
I hope he had
a designated driver.

05:29.628 --> 05:32.230
I can't believe
you're not worried
about randy.

05:32.231 --> 05:35.266
Would you relax.
This is the first time
we've been called in.

05:35.267 --> 05:37.401
When I was his age, my mom
was at school so much,

05:37.402 --> 05:41.072
They thought
she was an eighth-grader
with a station wagon.

05:41.073 --> 05:44.575
My parents first got called in
in seventh grade.

05:44.576 --> 05:46.677
Mrs. Manougian,
home ec.

05:46.678 --> 05:49.313
She gave me a "d"
in casseroles.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.783
So the problem
goes back that far?

05:58.591 --> 06:00.691
Mrs. Taylor.
Oh, oh, hi.

06:00.692 --> 06:03.194
Good to see you again.
Nice to see you again.

06:03.195 --> 06:06.698
Mr. Taylor,
thanks for coming in.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.133
I'd say thanks
for having us,
but that's...

06:09.134 --> 06:11.870
That's probably not
what most parents say
at this point.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.138
You would be the first.
Please sit down.

06:18.009 --> 06:19.410
I must admit,

06:19.411 --> 06:22.112
We were a little surprised
to be called in for randy.

06:22.113 --> 06:24.214
He's never been
in trouble before.

06:24.215 --> 06:27.851
Well, we feel the reason
randy's having problems in class
is that he's so bright.

06:27.852 --> 06:30.054
He's always ahead
of the other students.

06:30.055 --> 06:32.990
Well, what are we
doing here?

06:32.991 --> 06:35.993
Shouldn't you be
talking to the parents
of the dumb kids?

06:42.802 --> 06:46.237
What's happening is randy
finishes his work so quickly

06:46.238 --> 06:48.573
That he gets bored
and becomes disruptive.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.308
What should we do?

06:50.309 --> 06:53.111
We have a program where we send
a few exceptional students

06:53.112 --> 06:55.180
To the high school
for certain classes.

06:55.181 --> 06:58.983
We should send randy
to a high-school
science class?

06:58.984 --> 07:01.619
And a math class.
He's way ahead there, too.

07:01.620 --> 07:06.057
Wow! I hadn't realized
he was that advanced.

07:06.058 --> 07:08.593
Well, it's not
that surprising.

07:10.996 --> 07:14.332
His dad
skipped intermediate shop,
went right to advanced metal.

07:15.767 --> 07:18.603
Ah... You were
a shop prodigy.

07:20.639 --> 07:23.641
Well, let's just say
I was metallurgically
well-endowed.

07:25.578 --> 07:28.480
Excuse me. Can we
get back to randy?

07:28.481 --> 07:32.183
Well, all in all,
I think it would be great
for randy. Don't you?

07:32.184 --> 07:36.187
Yeah, but what about brad?
We already have a son
in the ninth grade.

07:36.188 --> 07:39.991
I'm not sure how he'll react
to having his younger brother
move up to the same grade.

07:39.992 --> 07:42.460
He said it was
just two classes -
science and math.

07:42.461 --> 07:45.363
We'd make sure they weren't
in any of the same classes.

07:45.364 --> 07:48.499
This is a big decision.
We should give it
a lot of thought.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.535
Yeah, we should.
Let's do it.

07:52.705 --> 07:56.707
You shouldn't make any decisions
until you see how randy feels.

07:56.708 --> 07:59.043
Talk it over with him
and give me a call.

07:59.044 --> 08:00.811
Ok, we will. Thank you.

08:00.812 --> 08:02.813
You bet. My pleasure.
Thanks for your time.

08:02.814 --> 08:04.815
You bet. My pleasure.
After you.
No, please.

08:29.742 --> 08:33.010
Just asked him one question,
and he spilled his guts.

08:41.785 --> 08:44.889
I can't believe it.
Mom and dad are still at that
teacher's conference.

08:44.890 --> 08:46.858
I'm dead.

08:46.859 --> 08:50.261
As someone who's been
through this many times,
can I give you advice?

08:50.262 --> 08:52.196
Shoot.
All right.

08:52.197 --> 08:55.933
As soon as mom and dad
walk through that door,
you gotta say, "I'm sorry."

08:55.934 --> 08:58.035
You know, like you
really mean it.

09:00.171 --> 09:02.540
All right, how's this?

09:02.541 --> 09:03.908
I'm sorry.

09:07.446 --> 09:09.447
Nope, not buying it.

09:10.715 --> 09:12.883
Hi, randy. Hi, brad.
Hey, guys.

09:12.884 --> 09:14.385
I'm sorry.

09:23.428 --> 09:24.929
Not buying it.

09:27.132 --> 09:29.934
It's ok, randy.
You're not in as much trouble
as we thought.

09:29.935 --> 09:31.268
I'm not?

09:31.269 --> 09:33.304
No. Your teacher feels
that you're goofing off

09:33.305 --> 09:35.372
Because you're not
being challenged.

09:35.373 --> 09:38.443
They want to move you
to high school
for science and math.

09:38.444 --> 09:39.744
Really?

09:39.745 --> 09:42.380
He's gonna be
in my grade?

09:42.381 --> 09:44.749
Just for two subjects.
He won't be in your classes.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.751
Are you ok
with that?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.620
I don't know.
Why should I care?

09:48.621 --> 09:50.921
Hey, that's the spirit.

09:52.358 --> 09:54.759
So, randy, this is
a big decision.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.162
I think you're gonna
have to take some time
and think about it.

09:58.163 --> 09:59.963
You're right.
Let's do it.

10:03.002 --> 10:05.870
Randy, these kids
are gonna be a lot bigger
than you are.

10:05.871 --> 10:08.673
Mom, the kids are always
bigger than me.

10:08.674 --> 10:12.210
You gotta love
this guy's spirit.
Always a positive thinker.

10:12.211 --> 10:13.944
Ow.

10:13.945 --> 10:16.247
What's in your pocket?
Oh.

10:16.248 --> 10:17.348
Pancreas.

10:22.954 --> 10:26.691
Actually, that's a colon.

10:26.692 --> 10:31.061
Unbelievable. I think
I'm in trouble, and I'm actually
going to high school.

10:31.062 --> 10:34.098
I'm gonna go tell jeremy.

10:34.099 --> 10:36.100
I guess it's settled.

10:36.101 --> 10:38.136
I'm gonna call the school
and see if I can catch
mr. Moreno.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.171
If you find him,
let him know that...

10:40.172 --> 10:43.007
Yeah, I know.
The colon's in the mail.

10:45.577 --> 10:48.045
Can I talk to you for a second?
Sure, dad.

10:48.046 --> 10:51.115
If randy makes this move
to high school,

10:51.116 --> 10:53.117
I'd really like you
to look out for him,

10:53.118 --> 10:55.352
Make sure people
don't push him around.

10:55.353 --> 10:58.088
I'm sure
randy will do fine.

10:58.089 --> 10:59.323
Ok.

10:59.324 --> 11:01.893
All right. Attaboy.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.629
Dad, I had a pretty cool
day at school, too.

11:04.630 --> 11:05.863
Yeah? What happened?

11:05.864 --> 11:09.900
I went to classes,
had a great lunch...

11:09.901 --> 11:12.903
Went to a few more classes
and, eventually, I came home.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.841
So, all in all,
we all had a great day.

11:20.279 --> 11:21.379
Yeah.

11:22.581 --> 11:23.714
Real great.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.287
Welcome,
ladies and gentleman,

11:30.288 --> 11:33.123
To the binford 6100
man's bedroom.

11:33.124 --> 11:34.792
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

11:34.793 --> 11:37.228
<i>(♪ fanfare)</i>

11:48.806 --> 11:51.208
Yeah, this is
no babe's boudoir.

11:51.209 --> 11:53.044
No honey's hideaway.

11:53.045 --> 11:56.080
No wench's way station.

11:56.081 --> 11:59.350
Men, you've had
lace in your face
for far too long.

11:59.351 --> 12:01.886
Now it's time
to come home...

12:01.887 --> 12:04.355
To chrome.

12:04.356 --> 12:07.024
That's why we built
the man's bedroom -

12:07.025 --> 12:09.026
So he feels
as comfortable here

12:09.027 --> 12:11.695
As he does
in his neighborhood bar.

12:11.696 --> 12:15.466
In fact, in the man's bedroom,
we have the neighborhood bar.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.275
Well, milton,
how's business?

12:24.276 --> 12:25.943
Slow.

12:26.945 --> 12:28.546
What'll it be?

12:28.547 --> 12:29.847
A perfect manhattan
for me

12:29.848 --> 12:32.916
And a shirley temple
for al.

12:32.917 --> 12:36.086
While milton's
mixing my highball,
let's look at the carpet.

12:36.087 --> 12:39.623
Marv, if you
want to come in here,
we have 100% astroturf.

12:39.624 --> 12:42.993
It's good for Saturday golf
and <i>Monday night football.</i>

12:42.994 --> 12:44.628
Milton, I'm open!

12:44.629 --> 12:46.096
Ooh. Ha-ha.

12:46.097 --> 12:48.699
Looks like
it's gonna be my day.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.701
<i>(dinging)</i>

12:56.541 --> 12:59.643
All right, let's take a look
at the nightstand.

12:59.644 --> 13:03.580
On my side...
A mesquite barbeque grill.

13:08.153 --> 13:09.387
On your side...

13:11.389 --> 13:15.559
You have a phone,
place for your beer
and a virtual-reality system.

13:18.197 --> 13:21.866
This way,
when your wife's
reading about fabio,

13:21.867 --> 13:24.969
You could be racing indy
with mario.

13:26.471 --> 13:28.172
In this case, guys,

13:28.173 --> 13:31.475
A fast-finishing bed
is not a bad thing.

13:31.476 --> 13:33.477
And if you do
make your wife happy,

13:33.478 --> 13:36.948
She's got
the little red button.
Press this...

13:36.949 --> 13:39.483
<i>(applause)</i>

13:43.755 --> 13:46.123
Thank you, honey.
I do what I can.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.261
I'd like to show everyone
my favorite part
of the man's bedroom -

13:50.262 --> 13:52.263
The man's closet.

13:52.264 --> 13:55.900
Most men
don't like to take the time
to coordinate their clothes.

13:55.901 --> 14:00.137
But in the man's closet,
all the work is done for you.

14:00.138 --> 14:03.007
Shirts, ties and pants
are on rotating drums.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.409
You just push the button
for the appropriate occasion.

14:05.410 --> 14:07.411
I'm going to
my mother-in-law's
for dinner.

14:07.412 --> 14:09.613
My wife's nagging me
about looking nice,
so I push "nag 1."

14:15.586 --> 14:16.754
<i>(bell dings)</i>

14:30.268 --> 14:32.269
That's a very nice
ensemble, tim.

14:32.270 --> 14:33.403
Thank you, al.

14:35.073 --> 14:38.775
Now let's get to the problem
of making that man's bed.

14:38.776 --> 14:40.811
That's right.
After a man's
slept in it,

14:40.812 --> 14:43.347
It might look
something like this.

14:46.150 --> 14:48.151
Now, who wants to waste time

14:48.152 --> 14:50.688
With hospital corners
and fluffing up sheets?

14:50.689 --> 14:53.123
You just press the button,
and the man's bed becomes...

15:03.668 --> 15:05.870
The man's pool table.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.806
Of course, we're gonna
need some cues, al.

15:18.784 --> 15:20.918
Hi, guys.
Hey.

15:20.919 --> 15:23.353
Ok, randy.
Let's hear it.

15:23.354 --> 15:25.355
How was your first day
at high school?

15:25.356 --> 15:27.357
Great. Except for the guy
who asked me

15:27.358 --> 15:30.094
If I wanted a phone book
to sit on.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.596
Did you tell the teacher?
It was the teacher.

15:36.234 --> 15:38.903
It's cool. He doesn't mind
if you call him baldy.

15:38.904 --> 15:41.572
We had a teacher
we called baldy.

15:41.573 --> 15:43.674
She minded.

15:45.944 --> 15:49.279
Well, I've finished my math,
and I'm done with my homework.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.949
Already? Wow,
you're doing really well.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.850
Uh, I'm done, too.

15:53.851 --> 15:57.288
You too? Good for you. I have
a couple of smart guys here.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.389
I gotta go to the mall.
Can I come with you?

15:59.390 --> 16:01.591
Sure. Do you
want to come, brad?

16:01.592 --> 16:04.228
I can't. I have to return
a call to angela.

16:04.229 --> 16:06.096
Ok. We'll see you later.

16:31.423 --> 16:32.423
Hey, wilson.

16:32.424 --> 16:34.391
Well, hi-ho, tim.

16:34.392 --> 16:36.794
Going skiing?
Mm-hmm.

16:36.795 --> 16:39.697
I don't know if I told you -
I'm a biathlete.

16:39.698 --> 16:43.100
Hey, whatever you do
behind closed doors
is your business.

16:45.203 --> 16:47.538
Well, actually,
we do it outside.

16:47.539 --> 16:49.940
Huh?

16:49.941 --> 16:52.810
You see, tim, the biathlon
is a combination

16:52.811 --> 16:55.879
Of cross-country skiing
and target shooting.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.649
I would have invited you,
but I figured you were busy.

16:58.650 --> 17:01.017
Oh, has it ever been
a busy week.
Mm.

17:01.018 --> 17:03.219
Brad is becoming
a really good student.

17:03.220 --> 17:06.522
Randy's so exceptional,
he's moved up two classes.
Whoa!

17:06.523 --> 17:10.828
And more importantly,
I built a really cool
man's bedroom.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.029
Hey, wilson.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.896
Neighborette.

17:13.897 --> 17:17.000
Tim, I just got a call
from the school about brad.

17:17.001 --> 17:18.035
Another "a"?

17:18.036 --> 17:20.036
No. He flunked
his last two tests,

17:20.037 --> 17:22.138
And he hasn't been
turning in his homework.

17:22.140 --> 17:23.874
What? He's been
doing so well.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.675
You know what's going on,
don't you?

17:25.676 --> 17:28.679
Well, it doesn't take a genius
to figure it out, no.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.080
He can't concentrate,
'cause the other kids

17:30.081 --> 17:32.983
Are asking him about
the man's bedroom.

17:38.723 --> 17:40.824
Well, what's your theory?

17:40.825 --> 17:42.526
Brad's problems began

17:42.527 --> 17:45.095
When randy started going
to the same school.

17:45.096 --> 17:46.897
I would tend to concur
with jill's theory.

17:46.898 --> 17:48.932
He's been working so hard,

17:48.933 --> 17:51.468
And then randy just swoops in
and outshines him.

17:51.469 --> 17:54.337
It's awful. Brad was starting
to feel good about himself.

17:54.338 --> 17:56.740
I don't want him
competing with randy
getting discouraged.

17:56.741 --> 17:59.109
What are we
going to do?

17:59.110 --> 18:02.746
Well, maybe you could
remind brad of the famous
hindustan proverb -

18:02.747 --> 18:05.082
"true nobility lies not
in being superior

18:05.083 --> 18:06.883
"to another man,

18:06.884 --> 18:09.453
But in being superior
to one's previous self."

18:09.454 --> 18:12.022
Ooh, yeah.
That is so perfect.

18:12.023 --> 18:15.326
Like it. Where do you
keep coming up with
these things?

18:15.327 --> 18:16.994
Oh, neighbor, neighbor.

18:16.995 --> 18:18.996
I've spent my life
studying the wisdom

18:18.997 --> 18:21.765
Of intelligent thinkers
and philosophers.

18:21.766 --> 18:24.567
However, this one I read
in a fortune cookie.

18:26.171 --> 18:28.272
Well, thanks.
See ya later.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.439
Mm.

18:33.377 --> 18:36.980
Brad, we got a call
from your school.

18:36.981 --> 18:38.916
You did?

18:38.917 --> 18:42.319
They say you're
not turning in your homework,
and your grades have slipped.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.321
So? Things are
back to normal.

18:44.322 --> 18:46.323
What? Up until last week,

18:46.324 --> 18:48.459
You were having
the best year ever.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.493
Does this have to do with randy
going to your school?

18:50.494 --> 18:51.929
No.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.398
Does this have anything to do
with the man's bedroom?

19:01.640 --> 19:04.975
Brad, there's
got to be some reason
that you stopped trying.

19:04.976 --> 19:07.110
You were becoming
such a good student.

19:07.111 --> 19:09.947
Randy's the good student.
You're both good students.

19:09.948 --> 19:12.716
He finishes his homework
before I can put my name
on mine.

19:12.717 --> 19:15.386
This is not about
who finishes first.

19:15.387 --> 19:19.322
It's about getting
the work done and absorbing
what you've learned.

19:19.323 --> 19:21.392
Yeah? Well,
he's better at that, too.

19:21.393 --> 19:24.094
Everything
comes easier to him.

19:24.095 --> 19:28.299
Honey, you shouldn't
compare yourself to randy
or anybody else.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.933
That's right. Um...

19:29.934 --> 19:32.335
This famous man -
hindu stan -

19:34.171 --> 19:37.007
...He never compared himself
to his brother hindu bob.

19:38.409 --> 19:39.876
Hindu bob?

19:42.313 --> 19:43.313
Look...

19:47.451 --> 19:49.486
...Honey,
you should take pride

19:49.487 --> 19:52.623
In how hard you've worked
and how much you've improved.

19:52.624 --> 19:54.625
School's
hard for me, mom.

19:54.626 --> 19:57.193
I know.

19:57.194 --> 19:59.529
Brad, your best quality

19:59.530 --> 20:03.834
Has always been
that you don't give up
when things get difficult.

20:03.835 --> 20:05.869
I remember
when you were a baby

20:05.870 --> 20:09.272
And you first started
eating solid food,

20:09.273 --> 20:11.307
The spoon never got
near your mouth,

20:11.308 --> 20:13.343
You had applesauce
all over your hair.

20:13.344 --> 20:17.180
Peas in your nose,
which wasn't very attractive
because you sneezed a lot.

20:17.181 --> 20:19.016
<i>(imitates brad's sneeze)</i>

20:19.017 --> 20:20.483
Yeah.

20:20.484 --> 20:22.485
The important thing is you
wouldn't let us help you.

20:22.486 --> 20:25.022
You did it till you
could do it yourself.

20:25.023 --> 20:27.491
Or when you started learning
how to ride a bike.

20:27.492 --> 20:29.493
Remember the bike I built you?
The stingray?

20:29.494 --> 20:32.062
We did the metal plate
paint job on that.

20:32.063 --> 20:36.900
It had a banana seat, and
it had a heated seat in that.
We had a coil run through that.

20:36.901 --> 20:39.136
The point that your father
will eventually get to

20:39.137 --> 20:41.138
Is that no matter
how many times you fell,

20:41.139 --> 20:44.474
You wouldn't let us
hold onto the bike. You
were determined to do it.

20:44.475 --> 20:45.776
I'm a genius.

20:45.777 --> 20:49.546
I taught myself
how to eat and ride a bike.

20:49.547 --> 20:54.584
You also taught yourself
how to get a's in school.

20:54.585 --> 20:56.787
You were very proud
of yourself about that.

20:56.788 --> 20:59.055
Yeah, but I had to
bust my butt.

20:59.056 --> 21:02.125
When I was in school,
english was my worst subject.

21:02.126 --> 21:04.127
I thought it was history.
History and english.

21:04.128 --> 21:06.129
What about-
what about spanish?

21:06.130 --> 21:09.666
Put an el corko in it,
senõrita, all right?

21:14.272 --> 21:16.973
The worst part of english to me
was creative writing,

21:16.974 --> 21:19.876
Where you had to express
all these great ideas I had.

21:19.877 --> 21:22.646
It was really hard for me,
but I worked at it,
and I worked it out,

21:22.647 --> 21:25.482
And I got better grades,
and I felt great
because of that.

21:25.483 --> 21:30.287
Yeah, I gotta admit,
getting those a's
felt pretty good.

21:30.288 --> 21:33.790
The greatest accomplishments
in your life

21:33.791 --> 21:36.994
Are gonna be the things
that you really have to
work hard for.

21:36.995 --> 21:39.263
I guess you're right.

21:39.264 --> 21:41.031
Of course she's right.
Look at me.

21:41.032 --> 21:42.932
I was finally able
to express my ideas,

21:42.933 --> 21:46.503
And one of them
eventually became
the man's bedroom.

21:56.047 --> 21:57.881
Hey.

21:57.882 --> 21:59.550
Hey, randy.

21:59.551 --> 22:02.485
Could one of you pick me up
after school tomorrow?

22:02.486 --> 22:04.855
Yeah. High school
or junior high school?

22:04.856 --> 22:08.725
Junior high school,
but then you have to take me
to the high school.

22:08.726 --> 22:11.461
Extracurricular activity?
Uh-huh. Detention.

22:13.998 --> 22:16.100
You're getting detention
in high school now?

22:16.101 --> 22:19.636
It wasn't my fault.
Well, who's fault was it?

22:19.637 --> 22:21.771
I was trying to concentrate
on my work,

22:21.772 --> 22:24.875
And all these kids
kept on bugging me
about the man's bedroom.

22:37.889 --> 22:40.590
Really?
In your dreams, pop.
