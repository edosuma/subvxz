WEBVTT

00:05.296 --> 00:07.968
STAN: So ever since Karl Fink
found out I could talk,

00:07.968 --> 00:09.390
we've been hanging out a lot.

00:09.390 --> 00:10.761
Avery doesn't get it.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.343
But then again,
she doesn't get

00:12.343 --> 00:16.097
mech suits!

00:16.097 --> 00:20.351
She also doesn't get
mech suit apple picking!

00:22.403 --> 00:25.146
The thing is, Karl and I
were having so much fun,

00:25.146 --> 00:28.319
I forgot all about
a very important event...

00:29.490 --> 00:31.412
Stan, there you are.

00:31.412 --> 00:32.953
You missed my birthday party.

00:32.953 --> 00:35.416
Oh, my gosh, was that today?

00:35.416 --> 00:38.079
I can't believe it.
I'm so sorry.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.080
What's your favorite present?

00:39.080 --> 00:40.081
I guess this sweater.

00:40.081 --> 00:41.332
It's from all of us.

00:42.793 --> 00:45.216
Avery, I can't believe
I missed your birthday.

00:45.216 --> 00:46.877
I'm sure you have
a very good reason.

00:46.877 --> 00:47.718
Um...

00:47.718 --> 00:49.670
It's not like you were
somewhere goofing around.

00:49.670 --> 00:51.672
Uh...
Or hanging out
with Karl again.

00:51.672 --> 00:53.264
Derp.

00:53.264 --> 00:54.805
I mean no, no.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.228
I was, uh--
I was on a date with Princess.

00:57.228 --> 00:59.390
Yeah, we were
walking in the park,

00:59.390 --> 01:02.773
gazing into each other's eyes,
eating each other's vomit.

01:02.773 --> 01:05.856
You know, romantic stuff.

01:05.856 --> 01:07.778
I guess it's okay
you missed my party.

01:07.778 --> 01:09.360
Are you sure
you're not upset?

01:09.360 --> 01:10.821
Yes.
Are you sure?

01:10.821 --> 01:12.363
Yes.
Are you sure?

01:12.363 --> 01:13.244
Yes.

01:13.244 --> 01:14.245
Are you sure?

01:14.245 --> 01:15.656
Yes!

01:35.886 --> 01:37.308
Stan, stroke of genius.

01:37.308 --> 01:38.599
We wear our mech suits

01:38.599 --> 01:40.181
to the Huntington Gardens
for high tea,

01:40.181 --> 01:41.272
then when the check comes,

01:41.272 --> 01:43.894
transform into cars
and roll out.

01:43.894 --> 01:47.688
First of all, yeah!

01:47.688 --> 01:49.780
Secondly,
I'm feeling pretty guilty

01:49.780 --> 01:51.572
about missing
Avery's birthday party.

01:51.572 --> 01:55.196
Avery had a birthday party
and did not invite me?

01:55.196 --> 01:57.198
I've been saving this noisemaker
since I was three,

01:57.198 --> 02:00.000
just hoping to be invited
to a birthday party.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.202
No, not yet, Karl.

02:01.202 --> 02:02.413
Patience, patience.

02:02.413 --> 02:03.624
Your day will come.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.207
Sorry.

02:06.207 --> 02:08.128
Maybe I shouldn't have
told you about the party.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.670
It's all right.
I'm not upset with you.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.302
Are you sure?
Yes.

02:11.302 --> 02:12.843
Are you sure?
Yes.

02:12.843 --> 02:15.346
Okay, I'm convinced.

02:15.346 --> 02:17.678
I just need to find a way
to make it up to Avery

02:17.678 --> 02:19.099
for missing her party.

02:19.099 --> 02:20.641
And maybe
I could find some gesture

02:20.641 --> 02:22.263
that shows
what a good friend I am.

02:22.263 --> 02:23.854
The cupcakes are really popular
right now.

02:23.854 --> 02:25.226
I could pelt her with those.

02:26.857 --> 02:29.360
I'm not very good
at this friends thing.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.322
We can discuss it
over high tea.

02:31.322 --> 02:32.823
Oh, I just remembered,
there's a dress code

02:32.823 --> 02:34.485
at the Huntington.

02:34.485 --> 02:36.327
We'll have to wear sport coats
over our mech suits.

02:36.327 --> 02:40.371
Where are we gonna find
two sport coats size 104 long?

02:40.371 --> 02:42.203
To Mother's closet!
Exeunt!

02:48.379 --> 02:49.670
Mom, I overslept!

02:49.670 --> 02:51.672
My Pinchy the Party Crab
alarm clock

02:51.672 --> 02:53.634
didn't play
his beach party music.

02:53.634 --> 02:56.677
Pinchy, you have one job,
wake me up.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.469
Okay, two jobs,
wake me up and party.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.221
And you did neither.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.973
Is that beach party music
coming from your room?

03:02.973 --> 03:04.305
No wonder my morning dreams

03:04.305 --> 03:06.307
are set to the song
Crabbin' USA.

03:06.307 --> 03:07.858
That's not a song he plays.

03:07.858 --> 03:09.610
Oh, then I'm back
to having a problem.

03:10.611 --> 03:12.363
Because I overslept,

03:12.363 --> 03:15.406
I missed the team van heading
to my first pro BMX competition.

03:15.406 --> 03:17.778
Now I have to get up to
Northern California on my own.

03:17.778 --> 03:19.159
I'll drive you.

03:19.159 --> 03:22.413
Mother-son bonding weekend!

03:22.413 --> 03:24.034
I'll just borrow Dad's car.

03:24.034 --> 03:25.496
Nope.
Why not?

03:25.496 --> 03:27.167
Well, partly because you're 17

03:27.167 --> 03:29.420
and you can't drive 400 miles
by yourself.

03:29.420 --> 03:33.384
But mostly because
it's mother-son bonding weekend!

03:33.384 --> 03:34.715
Fine.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.337
But when we get
to the competition,

03:36.337 --> 03:37.428
you don't get to go in.

03:37.428 --> 03:39.390
You won't even stop the van.

03:39.390 --> 03:41.762
I'll ride my bike out the back
like an '80s action movie.

03:41.762 --> 03:43.764
My code name will be Chet Fierro

03:43.764 --> 03:46.767
and you will be known
only as "The Syndicate."

03:46.767 --> 03:49.310
Or it could be
Trixie Le Deuce.

03:49.310 --> 03:52.353
She's wanted by the law,
but she fights for justice.

03:52.353 --> 03:55.025
And she also wants to sit
in the stands and cheer for you.

03:55.025 --> 03:56.447
But, Mom,

03:56.447 --> 03:58.279
every time I try to pull off
a difficult trick,

03:58.279 --> 04:01.992
you scream things like
"be careful" and "watch out"

04:01.992 --> 04:04.285
and "I had boots like that
in high school!"

04:05.456 --> 04:06.917
It's distracting.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.669
This is my first
professional competition.

04:08.669 --> 04:09.870
Don't you want me to do well?

04:09.870 --> 04:11.792
I do, Chet.
I do.

04:12.793 --> 04:14.295
Okay, I'll drop you off

04:14.295 --> 04:15.796
and stay far away
from the event.

04:16.837 --> 04:17.878
( clock playing music )

04:17.878 --> 04:19.300
Oh, now you go off, Pinchy.

04:23.093 --> 04:24.435
Trixie, please.

04:28.349 --> 04:29.940
Good luck at the competition,
Tyler!

04:29.940 --> 04:31.652
Drive safe, hon!

04:31.652 --> 04:34.395
You won't ever make me go
on a weekend bonding trip

04:34.395 --> 04:35.526
with Mommy, will you?

04:35.526 --> 04:37.318
No, Chloe,

04:37.318 --> 04:40.160
it's so sweet that you think
I have that kind of power.

04:41.362 --> 04:43.364
So, Daddy,
what should we do now?

04:43.364 --> 04:48.078
Well, I get to watch 30 hours
of professional wrestling

04:48.078 --> 04:49.209
I've recorded.

04:49.209 --> 04:52.082
And you get to
not tell Mommy about it.

04:52.082 --> 04:53.464
Yay!

04:53.464 --> 04:55.125
I love doing things
I'm not supposed to tell

04:55.125 --> 04:56.256
my parents about.

04:56.256 --> 04:57.798
What?
What?

04:59.259 --> 05:01.221
So why can't I tell Mommy?

05:01.221 --> 05:04.224
Mommy doesn't like it 'cause
I get a little carried away,

05:04.224 --> 05:08.559
especially when I do
my Reverse Atomic Suplex.

05:08.559 --> 05:09.770
( lamp smashing )

05:11.392 --> 05:14.735
There is another thing
you get to not tell Mommy about.

05:14.735 --> 05:15.776
Yay!

05:19.400 --> 05:21.442
So we've narrowed down
the nice things

05:21.442 --> 05:23.864
we could do for Avery's
belated birthday surprise

05:23.864 --> 05:26.286
to taking her bungee jumping,

05:26.286 --> 05:28.749
doing a flashy song
and dance number,

05:28.749 --> 05:32.162
or getting her a big,
hairy tarantula.

05:32.162 --> 05:35.215
Now why did I
write down tarantula?

05:35.215 --> 05:39.760
Oh, this is my list of
soft things that eat birds.

05:39.760 --> 05:43.724
So the tarantula's out
and bungee jumping--

05:43.724 --> 05:47.227
Why is a tarantula out
and bungee jumping?

05:47.227 --> 05:49.229
What are you plotting, Karl?

05:49.229 --> 05:50.891
Plotting?
I'm not plotting.

05:50.891 --> 05:52.022
Stan?

05:52.022 --> 05:54.775
Um, we're taking tarantulas

05:54.775 --> 05:57.398
who can't spin
their own webs bungee jumping

05:57.398 --> 05:59.610
so they can experience

05:59.610 --> 06:03.654
the exhilaration
of spider flight.

06:04.945 --> 06:06.366
Fine, don't tell me.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.288
But you better be careful,
Stan.

06:08.288 --> 06:10.581
Don't let Karl pull you
into some elaborate scheme.

06:10.581 --> 06:12.292
It's not that elaborate.
We don't even know
what it is yet.

06:12.292 --> 06:13.373
TOGETHER: What scheme?

06:15.045 --> 06:16.206
My arch nemesis

06:16.206 --> 06:18.298
and my talking dog
becoming friends.

06:18.298 --> 06:20.210
It's every girl's
worst nightmare.

06:20.210 --> 06:22.212
That and her dad
taking her bra shopping.

06:22.212 --> 06:23.964
BENNETT:
Avery, it's time to go!

06:23.964 --> 06:27.097
That last example
was not said randomly.

06:29.219 --> 06:30.971
This is awful.

06:30.971 --> 06:33.103
Now Avery's actually
upset with me.

06:33.103 --> 06:35.476
We really have to do something
great to make up for it.

06:35.476 --> 06:38.188
Well, she's already heard
bungee jumping and tarantula,

06:38.188 --> 06:39.440
so if we want to
surprise her,

06:39.440 --> 06:40.821
we have to go
with song and dance.

06:40.821 --> 06:42.402
But not in our mech suits.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.575
Last time I did that,
I activated the chainsaw

06:44.575 --> 06:47.448
and literally cut a rug.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.450
Song and dance it is.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.291
Oh, and by the by,

06:51.291 --> 06:53.994
add me to the list of
soft things that eat birds.

06:53.994 --> 06:56.537
I love me some chicken.

07:02.302 --> 07:04.254
Dude,
what happened out there?

07:04.254 --> 07:05.305
I haven't seen a crash that bad

07:05.305 --> 07:08.639
since the stock market
crash of 1929.

07:08.639 --> 07:10.050
What?

07:10.050 --> 07:11.932
I know stuff.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.054
Sorry about my riding, Red.

07:14.054 --> 07:16.477
I was just distracted
thinking about my mom.

07:16.477 --> 07:17.978
I could feel her out there.

07:17.978 --> 07:19.319
Watching me.

07:19.319 --> 07:20.320
Telling cute girls
about the time

07:20.320 --> 07:21.732
I ran away from a hummingbird

07:21.732 --> 07:24.404
because I thought
it was a big wasp.

07:24.404 --> 07:26.366
I thought you said
she was waiting in the car.

07:26.366 --> 07:29.069
I asked her to, but I just
know she didn't listen.

07:29.069 --> 07:30.070
I can sense her.

07:30.070 --> 07:31.281
She's somewhere close.

07:31.281 --> 07:32.372
Here, Mom,
can you hold this?

07:32.372 --> 07:33.203
Very close.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.415
( screams )

07:35.415 --> 07:37.958
Mom, I told you I didn't
want you at the competition.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.249
Why didn't you
wait in the van?

07:39.249 --> 07:41.922
You're my son
and I had to see you compete.

07:41.922 --> 07:44.294
And I didn't yell out to you
like you said not to.

07:44.294 --> 07:46.046
Besides,
I really wanted a corn dog.

07:46.046 --> 07:47.758
I'll eat anything on a stick.

07:47.758 --> 07:51.762
Little known fact about me,
I was raised without utensils.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.433
Even though
you weren't yelling,

07:53.433 --> 07:55.936
I knew you were there
and it got inside my head.

07:55.936 --> 07:57.397
I kept waiting
for you to yell out

07:57.397 --> 07:58.979
how cute I look
in my little outfit.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.400
You do look cute
in your little outfit.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.441
I know,
I also have great hair

08:01.441 --> 08:03.363
and Mediterranean
good looks,

08:03.363 --> 08:05.566
but I don't want to hear
about it while I'm riding!

08:05.566 --> 08:07.407
I'm sorry, Tyler.

08:07.407 --> 08:09.369
I'll go wait in the car after
stopping at the corn dog stand.

08:09.369 --> 08:10.821
I have a problem,
don't judge me.

08:13.113 --> 08:14.374
I can't believe my mom.

08:14.374 --> 08:16.166
I know.

08:16.166 --> 08:19.249
She didn't mention how cute
I look in my little outfit.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.381
But you shouldn't
be so hard on her.

08:21.381 --> 08:23.834
I wish my mom would come
to watch my competitions

08:23.834 --> 08:26.336
instead of teaching
disadvantaged kids how to read.

08:26.336 --> 08:29.219
Why has it always got
to be about her?

08:29.219 --> 08:32.222
Yeah, but you don't know
how embarrassing my mom is.

08:32.222 --> 08:33.844
Dude,
there's nothing embarrassing

08:33.844 --> 08:35.515
about your mom
being proud of you.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.638
In fact, one day
you just might think

08:37.638 --> 08:39.439
it's cool to have her around.

08:39.439 --> 08:41.021
And that's when you know
you're an adult.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.023
Now let's get
some cotton candy--

08:43.023 --> 08:44.194
Whoo!

08:47.818 --> 08:50.360
Ugh, Stan, I had no idea

08:50.360 --> 08:52.322
how difficult it would be
to write a song.

08:52.322 --> 08:55.245
Rock stars do it
and they're idiots.

08:55.245 --> 08:58.328
Karl, you're writing
on the computer.

08:58.328 --> 09:00.000
Why do you keep
crumpling papers?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.541
It gets out my frustration.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.834
I can't crumple a computer
now, can I?

09:03.834 --> 09:08.508
Mother can, then microwaves,
small cars, the boy's dreams.

09:09.930 --> 09:12.222
I think
you're overcomplicating it.

09:12.222 --> 09:15.265
We just need something
that says what's in our hearts.

09:15.265 --> 09:17.437
I am not overcomplicating it.

09:17.437 --> 09:20.390
Now help me find a rhyme for
"epistemological conundrum."

09:21.812 --> 09:24.104
Ugh, we're gonna be
here all night.

09:24.104 --> 09:25.646
Stan, that's brilliant.

09:25.646 --> 09:27.317
A sleepover
is just what we need

09:27.317 --> 09:28.689
to get our creative juices
flowing.

09:28.689 --> 09:30.821
My first sleepover!

09:30.821 --> 09:32.322
I don't want to
get you too excited,

09:32.322 --> 09:36.617
but someone's a night farter.

09:37.998 --> 09:39.039
His name is Tyler.

09:39.039 --> 09:40.661
More gossip to come.

09:44.294 --> 09:45.916
So you see,

09:45.916 --> 09:47.507
Python isn't gonna challenge
Destroyer Dan

09:47.507 --> 09:49.209
to another ladder match

09:49.209 --> 09:50.921
even though he used
an illegal submission hold

09:50.921 --> 09:52.843
to steal his title

09:52.843 --> 09:55.345
because it's all setting up
next month's Pay-Per-View.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.639
Python, you sly taco.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.142
Hey, let's have some fun.

10:02.142 --> 10:03.724
You lie down on the floor

10:03.724 --> 10:05.435
and I'll jump off
the back of the sofa

10:05.435 --> 10:07.487
and land on your face
with my knees.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.821
Sweetie,
professional wrestlers know

10:10.821 --> 10:12.492
how to do that
without getting hurt.

10:12.492 --> 10:14.444
Plus,
Mommy wouldn't approve.

10:14.444 --> 10:18.288
Well, Mommy's not here
right now.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.453
Okay, I'm gonna show you
one or two moves,

10:23.453 --> 10:25.125
but we have to
do it safely.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.087
Let's start
with a simple flip.

10:27.087 --> 10:28.088
Here, take my hand.

10:32.212 --> 10:35.515
Whoa, drinking all that milk
is finally paying off.

10:37.057 --> 10:39.099
Chloe, you didn't
actually make me do that.

10:39.099 --> 10:40.891
I was playacting with you.

10:40.891 --> 10:44.815
I was a college gymnast.

10:44.815 --> 10:47.317
I drank all that milk
for nothing?

10:47.317 --> 10:50.320
You're gonna get
Vitamin-D-stroyed!

10:50.320 --> 10:52.362
That was on the carton!

10:54.444 --> 10:56.116
Aah!

10:59.910 --> 11:01.912
( screaming )

11:07.167 --> 11:08.999
Say it's the milk!

11:08.999 --> 11:10.550
Say
it's the milk!

11:10.550 --> 11:12.132
It's the milk!

11:12.132 --> 11:13.383
Yeah, it is!

11:19.349 --> 11:20.390
Oh.
Hey, Stan.

11:20.390 --> 11:21.802
It's time to get ready
for bed.

11:21.802 --> 11:23.683
Actually,
I just came to get Robert.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.016
I'm having a sleepover
at Karl's tonight.

11:26.016 --> 11:28.899
We're gonna gossip,
but not about you.

11:28.899 --> 11:32.152
On an unrelated topic,
can I borrow your diary?

11:32.152 --> 11:35.405
You're sleeping at Karl's?

11:35.405 --> 11:37.197
You've been spending
a lot of time with him,

11:37.197 --> 11:39.659
plotting something devious
with tarantulas.

11:39.659 --> 11:42.242
Oh, come on, Avery.
Give Karl a chance.

11:42.242 --> 11:43.954
He's a lot of fun.

11:43.954 --> 11:46.666
Just last night we were
in our mech suits and then--

11:46.666 --> 11:49.329
Wait a minute.
Last night?

11:49.329 --> 11:51.171
I thought
you were with Princess.

11:51.171 --> 11:55.255
Um...
You missed my birthday party
to hang out with Karl Fink?

11:55.255 --> 11:56.296
Uh...

11:56.296 --> 11:57.467
And then lied to me about it?

11:57.467 --> 12:00.010
Derp.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.682
Stan, I forgave you
for missing my birthday

12:02.682 --> 12:05.766
when I thought you were
just being flaky and in love,

12:05.766 --> 12:09.399
but you actually
chose Karl over me.

12:09.399 --> 12:11.441
No, it wasn't a choice.

12:11.441 --> 12:13.774
I really forgot
about your party.

12:13.774 --> 12:16.116
I was just having
a good time with Karl.

12:16.116 --> 12:18.658
Well, you obviously knew
you had done something wrong,

12:18.658 --> 12:21.121
or you wouldn't have
lied to me about it.

12:21.121 --> 12:22.242
You know what you are?

12:22.242 --> 12:23.323
You are a bad--

12:23.323 --> 12:25.245
Don't go there, Avery.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.997
Don't call me a bad dog.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.628
No.

12:28.628 --> 12:31.001
You're a bad friend.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.213
Avery, I--

12:33.213 --> 12:35.375
You want to have
your sleepover with Karl?

12:35.375 --> 12:37.968
Go have your sleepover
with Karl.

12:37.968 --> 12:40.971
Obviously that's more
important to you.

12:43.223 --> 12:46.096
All right,
I have to go retrieve Robert,

12:46.096 --> 12:50.230
because he's a chew toy
and I'm one-eighth retriever.

12:50.230 --> 12:52.983
But I'll be back
and we can talk about this.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.407
Oh, there you are, Stan.

13:07.407 --> 13:08.959
I didn't know
where you were,

13:08.959 --> 13:10.961
so I started
the slumber party without you.

13:10.961 --> 13:14.294
I told myself a ghost story
and now I'm scared.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.877
Man, the worst thing
just happened.

13:16.877 --> 13:18.548
Avery and I had
a big fight about me

13:18.548 --> 13:21.972
spending so much time over here
and missing her birthday.

13:21.972 --> 13:23.924
Maybe I should just tell her
what we're doing.

13:23.924 --> 13:26.346
No, Stan.
The surprise is the fun part.

13:26.346 --> 13:28.518
It's like being ambushed
with merriment.

13:28.518 --> 13:31.351
Like when a clown jumps out
of a bush and honks your nose.

13:31.351 --> 13:34.855
I don't go
to that park anymore.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.566
When Avery hears the song
we've written for her,

13:36.566 --> 13:37.858
I guarantee
she'll forgive you.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.069
I just hope you're right.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.740
Of course I am.

13:40.740 --> 13:42.702
It's also the perfect
opportunity for me to show her

13:42.702 --> 13:44.494
what a good friend I can be.

13:44.494 --> 13:46.326
You think that the guy
who was developing the world's

13:46.326 --> 13:49.870
first zombie virus would have
friends, and yet somehow...

13:49.870 --> 13:52.502
I also love me
some turkey.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.668
That was really fun wrestling
yesterday, Daddy.

13:58.668 --> 14:02.722
Yeah, too bad we already
took it as far as we could.

14:02.722 --> 14:05.135
Unless...

14:07.427 --> 14:10.390
Yeah!

14:10.390 --> 14:14.234
Do you dare to get in the ring
with Dr. Pain?

14:14.234 --> 14:17.527
Because I'm about
to make a house call!

14:17.527 --> 14:20.610
But only between the hours
of 9 and 5.

14:20.610 --> 14:24.614
( rock music playing )

14:33.253 --> 14:34.794
The Scarlet Beetle
is gonna

14:34.794 --> 14:37.627
pick you up
with her insect legs,

14:37.627 --> 14:41.261
then communicate with other
insects using pheromones!

14:41.261 --> 14:44.965
That's right,
I read about beetles online!

14:47.177 --> 14:48.428
We'll start on three.

14:48.428 --> 14:51.391
One, two...

14:51.391 --> 14:53.773
Never trust
The Scarlet Beetle!

14:57.857 --> 15:02.402
( both screaming )

15:05.235 --> 15:06.656
Oh!

15:13.873 --> 15:15.205
Whee!

15:15.205 --> 15:19.039
Whee! Whee!

15:19.039 --> 15:20.630
Whee!

15:20.630 --> 15:22.302
Whee!

15:22.302 --> 15:24.254
Dr. Pain's not through
with you yet.

15:24.254 --> 15:28.508
I've got some questions
about your insurance!

15:28.508 --> 15:32.222
Come on, tag me out!

15:32.222 --> 15:33.433
Who are you talking to?

15:33.433 --> 15:36.016
My tag-team partner.

15:36.016 --> 15:37.357
Huh?

15:41.901 --> 15:43.153
Let's do this, Chloe.

15:45.525 --> 15:47.527
Maximus Slammus!

15:47.527 --> 15:48.528
You're my favorite wrestler.

15:48.528 --> 15:50.030
What are you doing here?

15:50.030 --> 15:51.661
He's my friend
Darcy's uncle.

15:51.661 --> 15:53.413
I gave her
my Rockstar Rabbit doll

15:53.413 --> 15:57.577
for this to happen.
Make it worth my while.

15:57.577 --> 15:59.579
So I understand you've been
showing Chloe some moves.

15:59.579 --> 16:00.580
Well...

16:00.580 --> 16:02.132
I know a few myself!

16:05.965 --> 16:08.298
Okay, let's--

16:08.298 --> 16:09.759
( screams )

16:09.759 --> 16:13.143
This is awesome!

16:15.975 --> 16:18.768
Well, here we are.

16:18.768 --> 16:20.810
I'll pick you up
after the competition.

16:20.810 --> 16:22.362
I guess I'll drive around

16:22.362 --> 16:25.775
and see what
Stockton has to offer.

16:25.775 --> 16:28.778
According to the pamphlet
I picked up at the motel,

16:28.778 --> 16:30.320
it was named

16:30.320 --> 16:33.373
"The Best Tree City
in the Western United States."

16:33.373 --> 16:35.745
Boy, I wish
you were riding BMX

16:35.745 --> 16:38.748
and I was getting
to check that out.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.581
Okay, Tyler.
I can take a hint.

16:41.581 --> 16:44.504
It's just that
I'm so proud of you.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.675
Good luck today, sweetie.

16:47.717 --> 16:48.968
There's nothing embarrassing

16:48.968 --> 16:50.300
about your mom
being proud of you.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.551
Maybe you're right, Red.

16:51.551 --> 16:54.934
But why are you wearing
lederhosen?

16:54.934 --> 16:57.307
I think you're remembering
me and the girl

16:57.307 --> 16:59.519
who sold us the giant pretzels
at the same time.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.521
Oh, yeah.
I do that sometimes.

17:05.355 --> 17:08.858
Mom,
you should come watch.

17:08.858 --> 17:11.241
I'm sorry I told you
to stay away.

17:11.241 --> 17:13.863
There's nothing embarrassing
about my mom being proud of me.

17:13.863 --> 17:18.037
If you want to cheer
when I'm riding, that's okay.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.369
You've always supported me.

17:19.369 --> 17:22.582
And plus, it's mother-son
bonding weekend!

17:22.582 --> 17:24.874
Aww.
That's so sweet.

17:24.874 --> 17:26.546
But that's really my bit.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.758
I'm only letting you do it

17:28.758 --> 17:32.262
because it's mother-son
bonding weekend!

17:32.262 --> 17:34.384
You see,
that's how it's done.

17:38.438 --> 17:39.639
ELLEN: Look out!

17:39.639 --> 17:41.851
Oh, no,
you're upside down!

17:44.104 --> 17:46.606
It's okay, I can cheer
when he's riding!

17:46.606 --> 17:47.857
He said so!

17:47.857 --> 17:50.780
Can I get a corn dog here?

17:57.367 --> 17:59.159
Hey, what's that?

17:59.159 --> 18:01.201
I won this
when Maximus Slammus

18:01.201 --> 18:02.542
and I beat Daddy
in a King-of-the-Ring match

18:02.542 --> 18:04.334
here in the family room.

18:04.334 --> 18:07.297
Oh, Chloe, you have such
a wonderful imagination.

18:07.297 --> 18:09.088
Never grow up.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.920
You too.

18:12.882 --> 18:14.974
Avery, we have
a very important message

18:14.974 --> 18:16.346
we want to share with you.

18:16.346 --> 18:19.679
And it goes a little
something like this...

18:22.352 --> 18:25.225
♪ I'm really sorry
that I missed your party ♪

18:25.225 --> 18:28.228
♪ I can't blame Tyler,
like when I get farty ♪

18:28.228 --> 18:31.861
♪ But worse than that,
I lied like a rug to you ♪

18:31.861 --> 18:35.865
♪ A horrible act you'd expect
for a pug to do ♪

18:35.865 --> 18:39.239
♪ As friends go, I know
I'm not your bestest ♪

18:39.239 --> 18:42.622
♪ But how could I not make
the cut on that guest list? ♪

18:42.622 --> 18:45.455
♪ My party invite must
have slipped your mind ♪

18:45.455 --> 18:48.208
♪ I live next door,
really hard to find ♪

18:48.208 --> 18:52.091
♪ What we're trying to say
through all of this fumbling ♪

18:52.091 --> 18:54.964
♪ Freezing me out
was really a dumb thing ♪

18:54.964 --> 18:57.757
♪ Avery Jennings ♪

18:57.757 --> 19:02.932
♪ You really are something ♪

19:02.932 --> 19:04.224
Yeah!

19:07.527 --> 19:09.229
Karl, I didn't
notice before,

19:09.229 --> 19:13.233
but your part of our friendship
song is a bit negative.

19:13.233 --> 19:16.326
Sorry, Stan,
I'm trying to stay positive,

19:16.326 --> 19:18.408
but Rome wasn't sacked
and destroyed,

19:18.408 --> 19:20.410
extinguishing the light
of western civilization

19:20.410 --> 19:23.203
for an entire millennium
in a day.

19:23.203 --> 19:26.206
The fact that you guys
would go to all this trouble,

19:26.206 --> 19:28.548
Stan,
your heartfelt expression

19:28.548 --> 19:32.752
and, Karl, whatever
you were singing,

19:32.752 --> 19:35.425
means more than I can say.

19:35.425 --> 19:38.798
So I made you this.

19:40.430 --> 19:42.011
( gasps )

19:42.011 --> 19:44.434
I call it "My Friends."

19:44.434 --> 19:48.228
Karl, I'm sorry that I didn't
invite you to my party.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.359
You are my friend.

19:49.359 --> 19:51.441
Friends?
Us?

19:51.441 --> 19:53.573
Oh, Avery, I'm touched.

19:53.573 --> 19:56.075
The moment is finally here.

20:00.620 --> 20:05.415
For those of you unfamiliar
with the term "anti-climax."

20:05.415 --> 20:06.996
And, Stan--

20:06.996 --> 20:08.037
Wait a second.

20:08.037 --> 20:09.419
Avery, this painting is

20:09.419 --> 20:11.711
of Karl and me
performing our song.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.593
How did you know
we were gonna do that?

20:13.593 --> 20:16.386
Were you spying on us?

20:17.297 --> 20:20.179
Derp.

20:20.179 --> 20:22.221
When Avery hears the song
we've written for her,

20:22.221 --> 20:23.603
I guarantee
she'll forgive you.

20:23.603 --> 20:24.804
I just hope you're right.

20:24.804 --> 20:26.516
Of course I am.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.348
It's also the perfect
opportunity for me to show her

20:28.348 --> 20:30.270
what a good friend I can be.

20:30.270 --> 20:34.404
AVERY: Oh, my gosh.
That's why Stan's over here.

20:34.404 --> 20:36.235
They're doing
something nice for me.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.857
I also love me some turkey.

20:39.409 --> 20:41.451
So are you ready to get
to work on the song?

20:41.451 --> 20:43.413
Yeah.

20:43.413 --> 20:46.205
I sure hope this shows Avery
how much I really love her.

20:46.205 --> 20:47.997
I wish she knew that.

20:47.997 --> 20:51.170
I wish she knew that no matter
how much time I spend with you

20:51.170 --> 20:55.174
or anyone else, I could never
love anyone like I love her.

20:55.174 --> 20:57.136
I'm sure she knows that,
Stan.

20:57.136 --> 21:01.511
If she did, she wouldn't have
said I chose you over her.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.383
She wouldn't have
shut the door on me.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.310
I'm so sorry, Stan,

21:10.310 --> 21:12.852
that I didn't trust
how much you love me.

21:12.852 --> 21:15.815
I'm sorry
I called you a bad friend.

21:15.815 --> 21:19.359
I'm sorry I lied to you about
why I missed your party.

21:22.612 --> 21:25.034
Well, this is every
boy's worst nightmare.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.036
His arch nemesis
and her talking dog

21:27.036 --> 21:29.329
making him feel like
a third wheel.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.871
Get in here, Karl.

21:31.871 --> 21:33.212
Oh!

21:34.624 --> 21:36.916
STAN: Sometimes
when friends have a fight,

21:36.916 --> 21:40.009
they come out of it closer
than they ever were before.

21:40.009 --> 21:42.091
And that wasn't the only
big win this weekend.

21:42.091 --> 21:43.803
That's right.

21:43.803 --> 21:47.136
I took care of a little fella
named Maximus Slammus.

21:49.809 --> 21:54.143
And I was riding high until
someone snuck up behind me.

21:56.736 --> 22:00.149
Never trust
The Scarlet Beetle.

22:02.402 --> 22:03.903
Good ridin', bro!

22:03.903 --> 22:05.615
Yeah! Yeah!

22:05.615 --> 22:07.617
What's up, man! Yeah!

22:09.369 --> 22:11.451
Tyler, you were amazing
out there.

22:11.451 --> 22:13.162
My emotions
ran the gamut

22:13.162 --> 22:17.377
from anticipation
to exhilaration to exultation.

22:18.878 --> 22:22.091
I mean, good ridin', bro!

22:22.091 --> 22:23.763
Yeah! Whoo!

22:23.763 --> 22:25.515
Yeah!

22:25.515 --> 22:27.306
It's cool
you let your mom watch,

22:27.306 --> 22:28.968
but I didn't know
she'd be so loud.

22:28.968 --> 22:31.100
How do you keep
your focus out there?

22:31.100 --> 22:32.392
What?
