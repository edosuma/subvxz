WEBVTT

01:18.184 --> 01:20.072
- I'm on three.
- We're stable.

01:23.304 --> 01:24.455
The door's sealed.

01:24.487 --> 01:26.695
- We have to try something.
- Stable!

01:32.584 --> 01:33.704
What're you doing?

01:33.736 --> 01:34.856
I
need confirmation from...

01:38.696 --> 01:39.911
It's
not an authorizing EBA.

01:39.942 --> 01:41.095
The door's sealed.

01:41.127 --> 01:41.895
You cannot do this!

02:05.704 --> 02:07.047
He's on five.

02:07.079 --> 02:09.192
James, I need you down there.

02:55.815 --> 02:56.742
Thank you, Lewis.

02:58.152 --> 03:00.168
You'll remind me never to
take your requests again.

03:02.439 --> 03:03.784
You know I love that song.

03:06.696 --> 03:08.135
O-2 flow

03:08.166 --> 03:10.695
initiated.

03:10.728 --> 03:11.528
Good.

03:13.223 --> 03:14.312
Okay, everyone,

03:14.344 --> 03:16.424
I need a comm status check.

03:16.455 --> 03:17.927
Confirm okay on me.

03:17.959 --> 03:19.496
Number two, okay.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.472
Three, okay, loud and clear.

03:24.647 --> 03:25.768
Nine months
in a tin can like this

03:25.799 --> 03:28.264
is enough to drive anyone mad.

03:28.326 --> 03:30.120
You okay back there, DeClerk?

03:33.191 --> 03:34.824
Four, okay.

03:34.856 --> 03:36.359
But I'm ready to get out.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.071
Roger that, Mathias.

03:40.103 --> 03:41.544
No arguments here.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.544
You awake back there, Weston?

03:47.304 --> 03:48.135
Five, okay.

03:51.111 --> 03:54.472
How can they call Mars
the bringer of war?

03:55.559 --> 03:57.000
It's so beautiful.

03:57.991 --> 03:59.142
Red Team Three,

03:59.175 --> 04:02.951
continue to broadcast
at your discretion.

04:02.982 --> 04:04.680
Mission Control observes
the trajectory here

04:04.711 --> 04:07.431
as being in track to target.

04:07.464 --> 04:09.928
We have you in the
pipe, five by five.

04:11.591 --> 04:15.111
Okay, prepare for
docking with Z.R.S.

04:15.144 --> 04:18.214
Okay, Lewis, take us in, mate.

04:18.245 --> 04:19.144
Roger that.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.678
Pilot has the comm.

04:21.639 --> 04:23.848
75-75, zero meters.

04:28.072 --> 04:30.983
Roll angle liminal, rate 0-1-2.

04:33.639 --> 04:35.400
Still go for docking.

04:36.936 --> 04:39.240
Target practically center.

04:39.271 --> 04:40.326
Panels are aligned.

04:40.359 --> 04:43.719
- Standing by.
- Cross hairs aligned.

04:43.752 --> 04:45.831
One meter, center aligned.

04:46.888 --> 04:48.039
And...

04:48.966 --> 04:50.022
Contact live.

04:53.224 --> 04:54.344
Control,

04:54.375 --> 04:55.943
Red Team Three confirms
contact and capture

04:55.976 --> 04:58.408
with the Zurban
Research Station.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.008
Mission
Control to Red Team Three,

05:00.039 --> 05:01.128
congratulations.

05:08.008 --> 05:12.808
Cap comm transfer
to Z.R.S. complete.

05:13.640 --> 05:14.824
You would've thought McGregor

05:14.855 --> 05:16.839
would've left the
lights on for us.

05:16.871 --> 05:19.943
Standard operating
procedure, Commander.

05:19.976 --> 05:21.992
For Christ sake,
DeClerk, it's a joke.

05:23.335 --> 05:26.696
Remind me how lone we're
spending on board the Z.R.S.

05:26.728 --> 05:29.255
- 18 months.
- 18 months.

05:29.286 --> 05:33.031
I sincerely hope you packed
your sense of humor, DeClerk.

05:33.064 --> 05:34.182
You're going to need it.

05:34.216 --> 05:35.815
And
equalization complete.

05:35.848 --> 05:37.479
All clear for
boarding, Commander.

05:41.000 --> 05:41.799
Go one.

06:03.943 --> 06:05.223
Mission Control.

06:05.256 --> 06:07.464
Mission Control, we have
a critical situation.

06:08.807 --> 06:09.767
I repeat....

06:12.039 --> 06:13.543
Zero minus eight.

06:13.576 --> 06:15.496
Zed-RS, this is Mission Control.

06:15.527 --> 06:17.383
Please repeat your
previous transmission.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.383
Please be advised.

06:21.416 --> 06:23.368
There is extensive
damage to the ship

06:23.399 --> 06:25.288
and communications
are failing, failing.

06:25.319 --> 06:26.504
We don't know how much longer

06:26.535 --> 06:28.103
we'll be able to
maintain the link.

06:33.288 --> 06:34.375
Be advised,
we no longer have you

06:34.408 --> 06:36.551
on comm sat at zero minus 16.

06:36.583 --> 06:37.384
High copy.

06:38.792 --> 06:42.855
0-9-6, repeat, Z.R.S,
please respond, over.

06:44.935 --> 06:46.855
Zed-RS, read back.

06:46.888 --> 06:47.880
Read back.

06:47.911 --> 06:49.096
Read back.

06:49.127 --> 06:50.951
Zed-RS, read back.

06:57.671 --> 07:00.072
Zed-RS, this is Shaw.

07:00.104 --> 07:03.144
I'm two clicks from
Relay Station One.

07:03.175 --> 07:05.639
Tell Weston I agree with him.

07:05.672 --> 07:07.111
Mars is beautiful.

07:08.423 --> 07:12.232
Reminds me of the empty
quarter outside of Abu Dhabi.

07:13.864 --> 07:15.943
Anyone up there listening?

07:18.823 --> 07:21.192
Z.R.S., this is Shaw, come back.

07:28.456 --> 07:29.639
Z.R.S., do you copy?

07:29.672 --> 07:31.719
This is Commander
Charlie Shaw, over.

07:34.536 --> 07:36.136
Zurban Research Station,

07:36.167 --> 07:37.864
this is Commander
Shaw, do you copy?

07:37.895 --> 07:39.176
Over.

07:42.152 --> 07:45.128
What the hell is
going on up there?

08:12.520 --> 08:13.480
Z.R.S, Shaw.

08:15.175 --> 08:16.679
If you're still receiving me,

08:16.712 --> 08:19.656
Relay Station One is
completely destroyed.

08:34.119 --> 08:35.078
An EBA boot?

08:36.294 --> 08:38.183
That can't be right.

08:41.225 --> 08:42.280
This is nuts.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.463
I hope you're
tracking me, Zed-RS.

08:47.496 --> 08:51.016
There's a lot of uncharted
territory out here.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.600
That's a lot of drops.

09:04.839 --> 09:06.503
Doesn't
even look like him.

09:06.536 --> 09:08.040
What?

09:08.072 --> 09:09.831
What, was that for me?

09:11.688 --> 09:12.711
I don't know.

09:47.687 --> 09:48.743
Shit.

09:48.776 --> 09:50.151
No, no, no, no.

09:50.184 --> 09:50.983
No.

10:37.992 --> 10:41.031
He's just
lost, that's all.

10:43.879 --> 10:45.735
Any
respond from him, Ransom?

10:45.768 --> 10:47.592
I've
tried everything.

10:47.623 --> 10:49.063
Nothing's working.

10:50.599 --> 10:52.871
How's Weston doing with comms?

12:19.880 --> 12:21.447
Get out of my head.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.527
Starting to hear sounds.

12:23.559 --> 12:24.487
I heard you.

12:26.792 --> 12:28.839
Get out of my, my head.

12:28.871 --> 12:31.496
All those years,
all those years.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.209
I'm warning you.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.040
Stop it.

12:42.247 --> 12:44.647
He's going insane.

12:45.960 --> 12:50.216
I don't know what we're
gonna do with him, my friend.

12:54.119 --> 12:54.920
Stop.

12:59.783 --> 13:03.367
I don't know
what's wrong with him.

13:04.232 --> 13:06.024
He needs to be restrained.

13:06.056 --> 13:07.144
Enough!

13:07.175 --> 13:10.407
I can't
tell who he is anymore.

13:16.871 --> 13:19.560
Ransom, he killed Lewis!

13:19.592 --> 13:21.063
He's waking up.

13:21.096 --> 13:21.863
Sam!

13:23.495 --> 13:24.264
Lewis?

13:25.607 --> 13:26.312
Lewis!

13:47.783 --> 13:49.256
I thought you
said he was sedated!

13:49.289 --> 13:50.663
He was!

13:50.695 --> 13:52.104
Jesus!

14:23.271 --> 14:25.864
20th of March, 2051.

14:27.239 --> 14:29.319
Second day of the journey
and nothing has changed.

14:30.695 --> 14:33.063
Everything is still
dyed in reddish dust.

14:34.216 --> 14:35.655
Dense.

14:35.687 --> 14:37.128
Toxic.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.527
Devouring everything around me.

14:53.319 --> 14:56.136
No one remembers
when it all started.

14:56.167 --> 14:58.599
Probably because there
are not many of us left.

14:59.687 --> 15:01.511
Only a few that still
have enough energy

15:01.543 --> 15:03.495
to continue breathing.

15:06.760 --> 15:09.159
The filters in my mask
won't last much longer.

15:10.824 --> 15:13.351
Our vital control
begins to fail.

15:13.383 --> 15:16.903
The dust makes any
source of energy useless.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.832
But I have to continue.

15:33.864 --> 15:36.295
I must find water
or we will all die.

15:44.168 --> 15:46.663
Red, like blood,

15:46.695 --> 15:47.591
like the plague.

15:48.775 --> 15:49.960
Only this time,

15:49.992 --> 15:51.367
mercy is not in God's plans.

16:23.752 --> 16:24.808
Where are you?

16:24.840 --> 16:26.151
I found it, father.

16:26.183 --> 16:27.975
The water source you
mentioned, it's right there.

16:28.007 --> 16:29.384
I told you not to go!

16:29.416 --> 16:30.951
I know
but I knew that.

16:30.983 --> 16:32.871
I don't care what
you thought you knew.

16:32.903 --> 16:34.663
I gave you an order
and you disobeyed.

16:34.695 --> 16:36.040
We are running out of stockpile.

16:36.072 --> 16:38.152
Will you stop yelling
at me and listen for once?

16:38.184 --> 16:38.984
Thank you.

16:42.856 --> 16:44.263
I was worried, Ana.

16:44.295 --> 16:47.015
I'm sorry but
it's right in front of me.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.359
That water could be the answer.

16:48.391 --> 16:49.127
What is
happening with the filter?

16:49.800 --> 16:50.664
What?

16:50.696 --> 16:51.656
Dad!

16:51.688 --> 16:53.672
Can you hear me?

16:53.704 --> 16:54.504
Dad?

17:27.271 --> 17:28.391
The filters, Ana.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.896
They'll resist.

17:29.928 --> 17:31.592
Be very careful.

17:31.624 --> 17:33.576
You know that nobody has
come back from there.

17:33.608 --> 17:34.760
I know.

17:34.791 --> 17:36.071
They
will go for you...

17:39.591 --> 17:41.895
Dad, can you hear me?

17:42.855 --> 17:43.624
Fuck.

17:47.527 --> 17:50.535
Urgency,
impatience, desperation.

17:50.567 --> 17:52.200
But also hope.

17:52.232 --> 17:53.192
Always hope.

17:54.024 --> 17:56.199
As a last bastion of resistance.

18:45.255 --> 18:49.223
Battery number five connected.

19:36.488 --> 19:38.248
Wake up, miss.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.608
Wake up.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.615
Please, calm down.

19:44.646 --> 19:45.735
Don't be afraid.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.879
Rid it?

20:39.912 --> 20:41.351
Yeah, thank you.

20:45.126 --> 20:46.984
Follow me, please.

20:47.015 --> 20:48.424
Can you stand up?

20:48.456 --> 20:49.223
Yeah.

21:03.784 --> 21:06.440
I really appreciate
it but, unfortunately,

21:06.472 --> 21:08.519
I'm, I'm running out of time.

21:08.552 --> 21:09.608
I came here looking for...

21:09.639 --> 21:11.046
Relax, I know why you came.

21:29.768 --> 21:30.920
Where did you come from?

21:33.095 --> 21:34.312
Where did you come from?

21:35.496 --> 21:37.479
Further south in the canyon.

21:37.512 --> 21:40.806
I lost communication over
a 100 yards from here.

21:40.839 --> 21:42.056
Oh, really?

21:42.088 --> 21:46.088
And you walk almost
20 miles by yourself?

21:46.119 --> 21:46.919
Yeah.

21:48.839 --> 21:50.344
Impressive.

21:51.879 --> 21:54.376
Connecting emergency battery.

21:58.536 --> 22:00.328
I have a feeling that
your people from the canyon

22:00.359 --> 22:01.959
have lost their energy too.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.232
Yeah, that's right.

22:05.896 --> 22:07.686
We barely have water.

22:13.351 --> 22:14.248
You'll help me,

22:16.104 --> 22:16.904
right?

22:22.664 --> 22:23.751
You should eat.

22:24.966 --> 22:26.504
You need to recover your energy.

22:32.646 --> 22:34.023
You will need it.

23:05.991 --> 23:08.200
We need
one another to survive.

23:08.231 --> 23:09.479
If not,

23:09.512 --> 23:12.071
what else is left for
us to remain human?

23:13.000 --> 23:16.455
In reality, it's very different.

23:16.488 --> 23:20.072
We each take what we crave
and the price of getting it

23:20.103 --> 23:21.319
is never too high.

23:24.328 --> 23:26.375
What is happening to me?

23:30.536 --> 23:31.719
What's going on?

23:32.679 --> 23:33.608
Plain and simple.

23:35.399 --> 23:36.200
You are the one

23:38.023 --> 23:39.368
who will help me.

23:44.136 --> 23:46.919
What
does it mean to be human?

23:46.952 --> 23:48.487
Helping our loved ones?

23:48.520 --> 23:49.799
Freeing them?

23:49.832 --> 23:51.496
Or is it the opposite?

23:51.527 --> 23:52.743
Draining their energy.

24:33.927 --> 24:38.407
Optimal energy production.

25:44.328 --> 25:46.600
Charging emergency batteries.

26:38.919 --> 26:40.295
Ana,

26:40.327 --> 26:41.129
is it you?

26:47.688 --> 26:49.287
Come on, let's go.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.352
Watch out.

27:07.112 --> 27:09.992
You shouldn't
have done that, Ana.

27:11.080 --> 27:11.975
Stop!

27:29.129 --> 27:29.928
I'm sorry.

27:48.392 --> 27:50.791
Clouds of
reddish dust surround me.

27:50.823 --> 27:54.089
Souls that agonize at the
service of their equals.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.712
Energy that always flows
in the same direction.

27:57.799 --> 27:59.463
Do second chances exist?

28:00.840 --> 28:02.729
Can they help to prevent
the mistakes of the past?

28:20.487 --> 28:21.320
I don't think so.

29:32.808 --> 29:34.920
Well, it's been scrubbed.

29:36.872 --> 29:39.815
They must've cleaned
it for the trip.

29:42.791 --> 29:45.256
It's a freight hold.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.352
Carries ore.

29:50.375 --> 29:51.527
Well,

29:51.560 --> 29:52.359
usually.

30:07.655 --> 30:10.887
There's not a lot
of food in here.

30:10.919 --> 30:13.064
Wouldn't it be
quicker by shuttle?

30:13.096 --> 30:14.535
Siyam, isn't it?

30:15.655 --> 30:16.839
There's enough food

30:18.215 --> 30:19.816
and you'll get a good meal
when you get to the hub.

30:21.992 --> 30:22.760
That's hers.

30:25.351 --> 30:26.919
All right.

30:33.159 --> 30:35.655
All right, so our meals
and water a separate.

30:35.687 --> 30:36.455
Hey!

30:38.407 --> 30:39.176
Hey, you!

30:41.032 --> 30:42.663
Look at me when I'm speaking.

30:42.696 --> 30:44.199
I said, look at me!

30:44.231 --> 30:45.736
Let's, let's not talk to her.

30:47.431 --> 30:48.231
Yeah?

30:55.911 --> 30:57.288
Did they tell you who she is?

30:59.272 --> 31:00.615
Just that
she's from the refinery

31:00.647 --> 31:01.671
in the western ridge.

31:02.920 --> 31:04.168
So why is she in there?

31:05.832 --> 31:07.752
You ask a lot of
questions, don't you?

31:09.607 --> 31:10.696
She's going to the hub.

31:11.784 --> 31:14.151
You can do anything
with her there.

31:14.183 --> 31:15.367
They have judiciary facilities,

31:15.400 --> 31:17.159
they have emigration control,

31:17.191 --> 31:19.687
they could be shipping
her off world.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.056
And they have medical bays.

31:24.168 --> 31:25.607
She could be sick.

31:45.224 --> 31:46.023
Water.

31:49.639 --> 31:50.439
Hey.

31:51.527 --> 31:52.295
Water.

31:55.623 --> 31:56.423
Come on.

32:10.184 --> 32:12.647
What if she's infectious?

32:12.679 --> 32:14.567
Trip's a day and a half.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.232
Sick or not,

32:16.264 --> 32:18.439
we need to keep her docile.

32:23.335 --> 32:24.935
Are you ill?

32:24.967 --> 32:26.151
No.

32:26.183 --> 32:29.063
Then why
are you in there?

32:35.944 --> 32:37.096
Go.

32:37.128 --> 32:39.208
I heard you said
you were reliable.

32:39.240 --> 32:41.287
Do you got what it
takes for this job?

32:43.048 --> 32:44.008
Don't disappoint me.

32:49.351 --> 32:50.215
Move back.

32:51.207 --> 32:52.839
Back, against the wall, come on!

32:54.151 --> 32:54.951
Back!

32:56.264 --> 32:57.320
You'll be okay.

33:28.422 --> 33:30.599
What the fuck is that?

33:30.632 --> 33:32.359
What is it?

33:32.391 --> 33:33.512
Someone was in there

33:33.544 --> 33:35.399
after they cleaned
this place up.

33:35.432 --> 33:36.776
They told
me it was just her.

33:41.224 --> 33:42.471
It's locked and it's cold.

33:43.431 --> 33:44.807
Can you get us in there?

33:46.535 --> 33:47.719
I don't know.

33:49.064 --> 33:51.304
It's a door between
two cargo holds.

33:51.335 --> 33:53.192
It's not an airlock.

33:59.816 --> 34:00.616
Wait.

34:21.382 --> 34:23.623
Remy, what the fuck is this?

34:25.480 --> 34:26.886
Don't toy with this.

34:34.472 --> 34:35.591
It's a bar code.

34:49.062 --> 34:49.864
"Radco B."

34:53.128 --> 34:53.927
Who's Radco B?

35:05.286 --> 35:06.311
Fuck.

35:06.342 --> 35:07.144
Fuck!

35:11.688 --> 35:12.935
Oy!

35:12.966 --> 35:14.344
There are dead bodies in there.

35:14.376 --> 35:16.071
What did you do?

35:16.103 --> 35:17.063
Huh?

35:17.096 --> 35:18.344
Radco?

35:18.375 --> 35:20.775
We all did it to each other.

35:22.599 --> 35:24.776
There's something
else in here!

35:38.022 --> 35:39.400
Did you
do that to him?

35:39.432 --> 35:41.352
- Radco?
- We all did it.

35:41.384 --> 35:42.536
Answer the fucking question!

35:42.568 --> 35:44.520
We all did
it to each other.

35:44.551 --> 35:45.351
Fuck.

35:45.384 --> 35:46.471
No!

35:46.504 --> 35:47.431
No!

35:47.464 --> 35:48.615
No, put it back!

35:48.647 --> 35:49.799
You need to get
rid of that thing!

35:49.832 --> 35:50.759
What is that?

35:50.792 --> 35:51.816
Listen to me!

35:51.848 --> 35:53.128
Do not touch it!

35:54.984 --> 35:56.359
It was in
there with the bodies.

35:56.392 --> 35:58.856
Do not touch it.

35:58.888 --> 36:00.102
It's not cold.

36:00.135 --> 36:01.959
How is that possible?

36:01.991 --> 36:03.591
What is this thing?

36:04.871 --> 36:05.799
What's this thing made of?

36:05.831 --> 36:08.391
Just get it off the transport!

36:10.119 --> 36:10.952
Please.

36:10.984 --> 36:11.944
Hey, Remy,

36:13.032 --> 36:15.784
maybe we should
just get rid of it.

36:15.816 --> 36:16.872
No, no, no.

36:18.024 --> 36:19.944
Maybe we should do
everything she says.

36:19.976 --> 36:21.383
This is how it starts.

36:21.416 --> 36:24.039
Listen to her and get
rid of the fucking thing!

36:27.751 --> 36:29.256
Remy!

36:31.880 --> 36:33.224
This is how it starts.

36:48.006 --> 36:49.800
I wanna see the
rest of the bodies.

36:52.902 --> 36:54.855
There's two more
of them in there.

37:05.799 --> 37:08.392
Did you kill them all
with your bare hands?

37:08.423 --> 37:09.320
Fuck you.

37:24.104 --> 37:24.936
Hey, Siyam.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.080
Hey!

37:28.583 --> 37:31.528
You've been watching him too.

37:31.559 --> 37:34.408
There are bite
marks on those bodies.

37:35.655 --> 37:38.216
- The nosebleeds will be next.
- Shut up!

37:38.248 --> 37:40.168
And then he'll
start to lose control.

37:40.199 --> 37:41.000
Shut up!

37:42.312 --> 37:43.719
Shut up!

37:43.751 --> 37:46.184
I don't believe a word
coming from your lying mouth.

37:46.215 --> 37:50.632
So you can tell your stories
when we get to the hub.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.656
We won't make it that far.

37:55.688 --> 37:57.576
Not if it keeps working on him.

38:00.359 --> 38:03.112
You have to trust me.

38:06.535 --> 38:07.880
Aisha found it.

38:07.912 --> 38:09.032
She brought it back to the base.

38:09.063 --> 38:11.112
The computer said to
was clean, it was sick.

38:13.768 --> 38:15.175
That was 12 days ago.

38:25.383 --> 38:28.806
And now you're
the only one left.

38:28.839 --> 38:31.976
You're trying to turn
us against each other.

38:32.008 --> 38:33.128
It won't work.

38:34.184 --> 38:36.168
Neither of us are safe.

40:03.272 --> 40:05.767
We're out of signal range.

40:05.800 --> 40:06.887
No more comms.

40:08.807 --> 40:10.919
When you touched it,

40:10.952 --> 40:12.680
did you feel anything?

40:14.792 --> 40:15.560
No.

40:16.647 --> 40:17.351
I did.

40:18.632 --> 40:19.752
Like it was...

40:21.095 --> 40:21.895
aware.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.423
Does that make any sense?

40:28.328 --> 40:29.575
I feel nervous

40:29.608 --> 40:30.791
having it in there out of sight.

40:30.823 --> 40:31.687
I think we should
bring it in here.

40:31.720 --> 40:32.936
We should just leave it.

40:35.431 --> 40:36.936
Don't
need to be afraid.

40:39.144 --> 40:40.456
We don't know what it is.

40:42.088 --> 40:43.145
Whatever it is,

40:44.583 --> 40:46.311
it's what this trip
is really about.

40:47.528 --> 40:49.383
That's why we're on
an ore transport.

40:51.111 --> 40:52.840
Moving it by shuttle
would leave records.

40:52.871 --> 40:54.343
It'll be logged and recorded.

40:57.607 --> 40:59.208
Her, she's just a...

41:01.543 --> 41:03.623
She's just a complication.

41:18.152 --> 41:19.976
I know you felt it too.

41:52.679 --> 41:54.152
Siyam.

41:54.185 --> 41:55.400
Wake up!

41:56.231 --> 41:57.543
Wake up!

41:57.576 --> 41:59.367
He's in the other hold.

42:13.863 --> 42:15.879
Remy?

42:21.383 --> 42:22.183
Remy.

42:26.023 --> 42:27.495
Remy!

42:27.528 --> 42:28.327
Oh, fuck.

42:37.385 --> 42:38.567
Remy,

42:38.600 --> 42:40.360
how long have you been in here?

42:42.792 --> 42:44.839
I'm going over to get that.

42:44.871 --> 42:47.336
I need you to step away.

42:47.367 --> 42:50.151
I don't know what this
thing is here, I don't,

42:50.183 --> 42:51.432
but it's changing you, Remy.

42:51.463 --> 42:52.327
It's mine.

42:52.359 --> 42:53.223
Remy, it's changing you.

42:53.256 --> 42:55.463
You've been warned!

43:02.312 --> 43:03.079
Let me out!

43:03.111 --> 43:04.265
No, don't!

43:04.295 --> 43:05.480
Don't!

43:05.511 --> 43:06.919
Siyam,
get me out of here!

43:06.951 --> 43:08.552
The door is sealed,
I'm gonna freeze!

43:08.583 --> 43:09.896
Don't listen to him!

43:09.929 --> 43:11.303
You're safe.

43:11.336 --> 43:13.191
We'll get this all sorted
when we get to the hub, Siyam.

43:13.223 --> 43:15.239
I'll be dead by
the time I get to the hub!

43:15.272 --> 43:17.000
It's freezing in there!

43:17.031 --> 43:17.895
So let me out.

43:17.927 --> 43:19.431
We can deal with him together.

43:19.464 --> 43:21.384
Stop, won't you stop?

43:21.416 --> 43:22.183
Fuck!

43:22.215 --> 43:23.016
Stop!

43:24.296 --> 43:25.095
Stop!

43:26.823 --> 43:29.287
Let me out, let me out.

43:38.729 --> 43:39.528
Remy.

43:48.168 --> 43:48.967
Fuck.

43:50.023 --> 43:50.823
Remy.

44:21.065 --> 44:22.503
Get off!

44:27.527 --> 44:29.415
You're
a piece of work.

44:29.447 --> 44:30.312
Shut up.

44:30.343 --> 44:31.655
It took three days

44:31.687 --> 44:33.287
for my crew to
turn on each other.

44:33.320 --> 44:34.505
You must have a lot...

44:34.535 --> 44:35.943
Shut up.

44:35.976 --> 44:38.791
Where's the moral
high ground now, Remy?

44:38.823 --> 44:39.591
Huh?

44:39.623 --> 44:40.647
Where is it?!

45:33.479 --> 45:34.311
No!

45:34.343 --> 45:35.111
No!

45:35.143 --> 45:36.263
Please, don't.

45:40.871 --> 45:41.863
Please.

45:41.895 --> 45:42.695
No.

45:44.552 --> 45:45.575
Please.

45:45.607 --> 45:50.152
Please.

46:03.656 --> 46:06.216
You know, when we get there...

46:09.031 --> 46:11.432
They'll dispose of us.

48:42.599 --> 48:43.784
Huh?

50:48.935 --> 50:49.704
Huh?

51:26.599 --> 51:27.752
Huh?

56:45.223 --> 56:46.439
And that's uncommon?

56:46.472 --> 56:48.648
He
was just standing there.

56:48.679 --> 56:50.343
Who is he?

56:50.376 --> 56:51.528
He, your neighbor?

56:52.455 --> 56:53.479
He was.

56:53.511 --> 56:55.239
You've gotta go.

56:55.272 --> 56:57.800
And he wasn't.

56:57.831 --> 57:00.647
I don't know what
to do with that.

57:00.680 --> 57:01.896
Was there something else?

57:01.928 --> 57:03.496
I'm after help.

57:03.527 --> 57:04.839
Don't you look into this stuff?

57:04.872 --> 57:06.311
Yeah, you need police.

57:07.303 --> 57:08.105
Psych eval.

57:09.479 --> 57:10.632
You get to call me when
your neighbor is abducted

57:10.663 --> 57:12.552
or when that light
you saw proves...

57:12.583 --> 57:14.631
Not light, light.

57:14.664 --> 57:15.943
Weird light.

57:15.976 --> 57:18.056
Hang on, I've
got another call.

57:18.087 --> 57:19.239
Yeah.

57:19.272 --> 57:22.152
Yeah, is this
a Vanessa Markes?

57:22.183 --> 57:25.896
A call-in conspiracy journalist,
writer and shit friend?

57:27.272 --> 57:28.776
Sorry, wrong number.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.407
So where'd
you get to on this?

57:34.439 --> 57:35.848
I think I got
a pretty good idea of it

57:35.880 --> 57:37.832
from when we spoke on the phone.

57:37.865 --> 57:39.336
It all worked out.

57:39.368 --> 57:41.159
I know how I wanna play it,

57:41.192 --> 57:43.016
after a bit of color.

57:43.047 --> 57:44.903
From half an
hour on the phone?

57:46.248 --> 57:48.583
There's still running
water in a dead bed's house?

57:48.616 --> 57:50.600
Yeah, well, I've got
a tub. I keep that full.

57:54.888 --> 57:56.360
I don't wash myself in it.

58:04.680 --> 58:06.569
Tell me what you've got then.

58:06.600 --> 58:08.232
I don't have a lot.

58:08.263 --> 58:09.575
Bit of L. Ron vibes.

58:09.607 --> 58:12.487
Bit of...

58:12.520 --> 58:14.151
NASA secret coverup.

58:16.071 --> 58:17.192
Essentially we're all slaves

58:17.225 --> 58:18.471
to the same
extraterrestrial race.

58:18.503 --> 58:20.072
I never said
the word "slaves."

58:20.105 --> 58:22.952
Then there's that whole aliens
hijacking our planet thing,

58:22.985 --> 58:23.880
whatever that is.

58:23.912 --> 58:25.063
Yeah.

58:25.095 --> 58:26.247
Can you read me
what you've written?

58:26.279 --> 58:27.689
Oh, that's not
how I usually work.

58:27.720 --> 58:29.735
Well, you're writing
about me, what I know, so.

58:29.767 --> 58:31.687
More an editorial
control kind of thing.

58:38.856 --> 58:41.160
You're missing why
all this matters.

58:41.192 --> 58:42.089
Right.

58:42.120 --> 58:42.919
Sort of...

58:44.009 --> 58:44.775
Color.

58:44.808 --> 58:45.864
Yeah.

58:45.896 --> 58:46.663
"Color."

58:46.695 --> 58:48.967
It's not color, it's...

58:51.111 --> 58:51.943
Try to listen.

58:53.767 --> 58:55.368
To write it, I can't
stay long enough

58:55.399 --> 58:56.743
to do this again in person.

58:58.440 --> 59:00.839
You've got this view
from 30 thousand feet.

59:00.872 --> 59:04.295
Trying to give you a view
from 30 thousand light years.

59:05.351 --> 59:06.823
And instantly

59:06.855 --> 59:08.552
they said it was rooibos.

59:08.583 --> 59:10.215
I know rooibos when I smell it.

59:11.367 --> 59:14.599
I mean, it's some red leaf.

59:21.223 --> 59:23.016
How would you
contain an outbreak?

59:29.511 --> 59:32.167
You'd isolate the victim,
eradicate the infection

59:32.200 --> 59:33.351
and then release, right?

59:33.383 --> 59:35.623
Yeah, would you?

59:37.543 --> 59:40.040
We're not
fighting a typical plague.

59:41.159 --> 59:42.983
What I know, the
truth about them,

59:43.016 --> 59:45.096
that's the infection
they care about.

59:46.376 --> 59:48.776
They don't isolate,
eradicate and release.

59:50.055 --> 59:54.185
They send a Skin
Creeper to replicate,

59:54.215 --> 59:56.199
annihilate and replace.

59:56.231 --> 59:57.832
Skin Creeper.

59:59.111 --> 01:00:00.391
An exact copy.

01:00:02.087 --> 01:00:03.656
Right down to your thoughts.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:07.176
Van, what's up?

01:00:10.505 --> 01:00:11.304
Van?

01:00:14.312 --> 01:00:17.192
Now, now, why are
you so paranoid?

01:00:20.904 --> 01:00:22.376
People need to know this.

01:00:22.407 --> 01:00:25.512
And not just guys in
basements with tinfoil hats.

01:00:25.543 --> 01:00:27.271
I'm talking everyone.

01:00:27.303 --> 01:00:29.831
And I'm gonna
spread the infection?

01:00:29.863 --> 01:00:32.039
Right now, you're
looking at the only host.

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:34.056
Just get it down.

01:00:35.336 --> 01:00:36.487
Get it out.

01:00:36.519 --> 01:00:38.823
The truth will move
quicker than they can.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.279
Van?

01:00:43.944 --> 01:00:46.087
Do you wanna stop for a bit?

01:00:46.119 --> 01:00:47.079
No, no, all good.

01:00:48.423 --> 01:00:49.223
Lie.

01:00:52.071 --> 01:00:54.440
I'll tell you about
it on the way back.

01:00:54.472 --> 01:00:56.295
That guy I met with today.

01:00:56.328 --> 01:00:57.127
Nutcase.

01:02:29.735 --> 01:02:30.600
You're up late.

01:02:30.632 --> 01:02:32.232
Oh, Jesus, what're you?

01:02:33.063 --> 01:02:35.016
I'm a recluse,

01:02:35.047 --> 01:02:36.679
not an animal.

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:39.591
All your bullshit's been
bouncing around in my head.

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:41.575
I have some questions.

01:02:41.607 --> 01:02:44.744
Yeah, well, bullshit
doesn't stick as hard as that.

01:02:44.776 --> 01:02:47.496
No, now you're listening.

01:02:47.527 --> 01:02:48.776
Really listening.

01:02:50.472 --> 01:02:52.135
Why an exact copy?

01:02:52.167 --> 01:02:55.464
And why would it kill if
it doesn't know what it is?

01:02:55.496 --> 01:02:56.360
Where's my phone?

01:02:56.392 --> 01:02:57.575
It doesn't need to know.

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.336
It just needs to think
it has a life to find.

01:02:59.368 --> 01:03:00.519
Wait.

01:03:00.551 --> 01:03:01.863
Wait, wait, I need
to record this.

01:03:05.479 --> 01:03:06.952
I didn't leave that light on.

01:03:12.071 --> 01:03:13.864
Is this some kind of joke?

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:18.280
Oh, fuck me!

01:03:18.312 --> 01:03:19.432
Help me, hurry!

01:03:19.464 --> 01:03:20.647
Cotton,
what's going on?

01:03:22.951 --> 01:03:23.783
Do something!

01:03:23.815 --> 01:03:24.583
Who is that?

01:03:24.615 --> 01:03:25.735
What have you done?

01:03:25.767 --> 01:03:27.367
Torch, get the torch!

01:03:27.399 --> 01:03:29.128
Cotton, what the fuck is this?

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.016
Get
the fuck out of the way

01:03:31.048 --> 01:03:33.447
because I've been
waiting for this!

01:03:33.479 --> 01:03:34.888
Get us the torch.

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.872
Skin Creeper.

01:03:36.904 --> 01:03:37.927
Get us the torch.

01:03:37.959 --> 01:03:39.015
Oh, fuck!

01:03:39.047 --> 01:03:40.231
Stay with us!

01:03:41.959 --> 01:03:43.560
I'm gonna go get help.

01:04:02.376 --> 01:04:03.175
Van!

01:04:08.264 --> 01:04:09.799
Stay the fuck away!

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.767
It's quick and easy.

01:04:37.799 --> 01:04:38.663
Not quick enough.

01:04:38.695 --> 01:04:40.136
I won't let you botch the hit.

01:04:41.575 --> 01:04:42.856
You won't let me.

01:04:45.608 --> 01:04:46.632
So what then?

01:04:47.464 --> 01:04:48.263
Hmmm?

01:04:59.879 --> 01:05:01.256
I thought you wanted quick?

01:05:01.288 --> 01:05:02.280
Come on, drowning's
at least a good...

01:05:02.312 --> 01:05:03.880
Quick and,

01:05:03.912 --> 01:05:05.800
I don't know, respectful.

01:05:08.391 --> 01:05:09.255
Mainly quick.

01:05:11.399 --> 01:05:14.119
You fry them within
three seconds in the tub.

01:05:14.151 --> 01:05:15.015
I fry them?

01:05:17.927 --> 01:05:18.727
Hey,

01:05:19.592 --> 01:05:21.671
you wanted to complicate this.

01:05:21.702 --> 01:05:23.847
Cotton, I'm not a killer.

01:05:40.199 --> 01:05:42.568
I'll hold him down

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.903
but you've gotta throw it in.

01:05:46.408 --> 01:05:47.208
Van?

01:05:48.743 --> 01:05:49.832
Cotton!

01:05:49.864 --> 01:05:50.663
Hey!

01:05:51.495 --> 01:05:52.295
Cotton!

01:05:58.888 --> 01:05:59.688
Van?

01:06:00.935 --> 01:06:03.015
She was the one
that fainted, not me.

01:06:03.047 --> 01:06:04.007
She fainted.

01:06:08.839 --> 01:06:09.639
Oh.

01:06:11.815 --> 01:06:14.920
Oh, you don't wanna crawl
inside a Skin Creeper's head.

01:06:18.471 --> 01:06:19.880
Van?

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:28.360
Nice.

01:06:49.671 --> 01:06:50.472
Whoa.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.240
Van?

01:06:56.295 --> 01:06:57.702
Tell me again.

01:06:57.735 --> 01:06:59.591
Drop lamp, dead.

01:06:59.622 --> 01:07:00.582
All right.

01:07:01.896 --> 01:07:04.455
Well that's got a
bit of a ring to it.

01:07:04.487 --> 01:07:05.672
I'm ready, I can do it.

01:07:05.704 --> 01:07:08.104
- I can do it, come on.
- Okay, okay.

01:07:11.239 --> 01:07:12.456
One,

01:07:12.488 --> 01:07:13.288
two...

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:16.488
three!

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.200
Hit it, Van!

01:07:20.999 --> 01:07:22.248
Come on!

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.048
Van!

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.455
What're you waiting for?

01:07:24.486 --> 01:07:26.280
Just a fucking second!

01:07:29.224 --> 01:07:30.088
Fuck, wait!

01:07:33.064 --> 01:07:36.039
Let him go, whoever
the fuck you are!

01:07:37.191 --> 01:07:38.344
Cotton!

01:07:40.871 --> 01:07:41.671
Cotton?

01:07:45.863 --> 01:07:46.631
Cotton?

01:07:49.415 --> 01:07:50.184
Cotton.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.848
There's just one
Skin Creeper now.

01:08:00.232 --> 01:08:01.895
Skin Creeper?

01:08:09.992 --> 01:08:10.792
Van?

01:08:12.231 --> 01:08:13.256
Van?

01:08:14.856 --> 01:08:15.879
Van?

01:08:15.912 --> 01:08:16.679
Van!

01:08:16.712 --> 01:08:17.832
I'm here.

01:08:17.863 --> 01:08:18.599
Let's get
the fuck out of here!

01:08:18.631 --> 01:08:19.496
I can't leave it!

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:20.488
It'll find me, it'll kill me!

01:08:20.519 --> 01:08:21.639
Out, out, out!

01:08:21.671 --> 01:08:23.880
We need to get
out of this house!

01:08:23.911 --> 01:08:25.895
I've gotta finish it.

01:08:25.926 --> 01:08:26.854
It'll hunt me.

01:08:26.886 --> 01:08:28.520
If it lives, I die!

01:08:31.078 --> 01:08:31.880
So I die?

01:08:34.984 --> 01:08:35.783
What?

01:08:38.087 --> 01:08:39.111
You live...

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:41.799
You live if I die.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:46.599
Me.

01:10:01.704 --> 01:10:03.528
Get out of my head.

01:10:05.575 --> 01:10:06.791
Did I hurt you?

01:10:08.903 --> 01:10:10.919
Get out of my, my head.

01:10:10.952 --> 01:10:15.335
All
those years, all those years.

01:10:20.392 --> 01:10:21.256
I'm warning you.

01:10:21.287 --> 01:10:23.688
Stop it.

01:10:24.519 --> 01:10:26.824
He's going insane.

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:28.199
Training.

01:10:28.232 --> 01:10:29.256
I don't know
what we're gonna do with him.

01:10:29.288 --> 01:10:31.528
My friend.

01:10:35.976 --> 01:10:37.479
Stop.

01:10:41.864 --> 01:10:46.183
I don't know
what's wrong with him.

01:10:46.216 --> 01:10:48.071
He needs to be restrained.

01:10:48.103 --> 01:10:49.256
Enough.

01:10:49.288 --> 01:10:52.455
I can't tell
who he is anymore.

01:10:59.112 --> 01:11:01.543
Ransom, he killed Lewis!

01:11:01.576 --> 01:11:03.048
He's waking up.

01:11:03.079 --> 01:11:03.879
Sam!

01:11:05.512 --> 01:11:06.311
Lewis?

01:11:07.656 --> 01:11:08.456
Lewis!

01:11:29.512 --> 01:11:31.400
I thought you
said he was sedated?

01:11:31.432 --> 01:11:32.519
He was!

01:11:32.552 --> 01:11:33.320
Jesus!

01:11:59.592 --> 01:12:01.512
You killed me.

01:12:57.671 --> 01:12:58.791
I...

01:13:00.103 --> 01:13:02.600
I don't know what
to call it, I...

01:13:02.631 --> 01:13:04.808
I'm not sure I can do that.

01:13:05.799 --> 01:13:07.303
What about Ransom?

01:13:07.336 --> 01:13:10.087
She's not thinking straight.

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:13.639
Her relationship has
compromised our safety.

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:17.896
You saw what he cost Staples.

01:13:19.783 --> 01:13:21.384
You must back me up.

01:13:38.568 --> 01:13:39.624
Ransom.

01:13:48.455 --> 01:13:49.352
He's not...

01:13:49.385 --> 01:13:51.335
Charlie, he's a monster.

01:13:51.367 --> 01:13:52.295
He wouldn't.

01:15:17.319 --> 01:15:18.343
No, no, no.

01:15:20.871 --> 01:15:22.248
No, no.

01:15:22.279 --> 01:15:23.655
No, guys,

01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:25.128
this is a mistake.

01:15:26.471 --> 01:15:28.391
It's mistake, Staples...

01:15:32.808 --> 01:15:37.383
Staples, I'm sorry!

01:15:40.007 --> 01:15:42.887
Get me the fuck out
of this airlock!

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:44.680
Right now!

01:15:46.919 --> 01:15:48.232
I'm sorry.

01:15:48.264 --> 01:15:49.671
I'm sorry.

01:15:49.703 --> 01:15:52.200
It's not what it's meant to be.

01:15:53.319 --> 01:15:54.792
Just come...

01:15:54.823 --> 01:15:56.904
Someone come and save me.

01:15:56.936 --> 01:16:00.744
I'm scared, I don't know
what the fuck is going on!

01:16:00.776 --> 01:16:02.407
Just let, let me...

01:16:02.439 --> 01:16:03.399
Let

01:16:03.432 --> 01:16:04.807
me

01:16:04.839 --> 01:16:05.640
out!

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.519
Come on!

01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:38.856
Quickly now, Weston!

01:16:38.887 --> 01:16:42.503
It's hard to override the
sensors with him in there.

01:16:43.752 --> 01:16:47.912
No, no, no, DeClerk!

01:16:47.944 --> 01:16:49.991
Weston, you open
these door immediately!

01:16:50.023 --> 01:16:51.432
That's an order!

01:16:51.463 --> 01:16:53.031
Don't listen to him, Weston.

01:16:53.063 --> 01:16:55.272
This is my goddamn ship!

01:16:55.303 --> 01:16:56.647
Seal it up!

01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:58.440
I'm trying!

01:16:58.472 --> 01:17:00.455
When I get out
of here, DeClerk,

01:17:00.487 --> 01:17:01.927
you're next.

01:17:01.959 --> 01:17:05.832
Got it!

01:17:05.863 --> 01:17:08.840
I don't know how
long that will hold.

01:17:25.128 --> 01:17:27.816
Sam: What's going on here?

01:17:27.847 --> 01:17:29.992
See for yourself.

01:17:30.024 --> 01:17:30.792
Charlie!

01:17:32.712 --> 01:17:33.896
I don't know what's
wrong with him.

01:17:33.929 --> 01:17:36.840
But I do know if he gets
out he'll kill again.

01:17:36.872 --> 01:17:39.399
What are you doing, Mathias?

01:17:39.432 --> 01:17:41.000
Salvaging this mission.

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:42.727
Making sure we all get home.

01:17:42.759 --> 01:17:44.039
Just as he would in my place.

01:17:44.071 --> 01:17:45.031
Let me out, now!

01:17:45.063 --> 01:17:47.495
You are nothing like him.

01:17:47.527 --> 01:17:49.992
He would make sure you got
the proper medical care.

01:17:50.024 --> 01:17:51.463
Look where we are!

01:17:51.495 --> 01:17:53.129
We're not exactly fitted
up for the type of

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.784
longterm mental
healthcare he needs.

01:17:57.415 --> 01:17:58.343
But I can help him.

01:17:58.375 --> 01:17:59.399
What with?

01:17:59.431 --> 01:18:00.616
Sedation?

01:18:00.648 --> 01:18:01.959
We know how that's working.

01:18:01.991 --> 01:18:03.399
Perhaps.

01:18:03.431 --> 01:18:05.159
I don't know, okay, but
neither is locking him up.

01:18:11.079 --> 01:18:14.184
Who said anything
about locking him up?

01:18:14.216 --> 01:18:15.527
Ready?

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.615
I'm sorry, Sam.

01:18:16.647 --> 01:18:17.671
No, no!

01:18:17.703 --> 01:18:18.759
No, you can't do this!

01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:19.559
You can't do this!

01:18:19.591 --> 01:18:20.487
Wait, it's not right!

01:18:20.519 --> 01:18:21.928
It's murder!

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.592
You're wrong!

01:18:23.624 --> 01:18:24.872
It's not murder.

01:18:24.904 --> 01:18:25.959
It's survival.

01:18:25.991 --> 01:18:27.303
He's our commander!

01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:28.807
He's our commander!

01:18:28.839 --> 01:18:29.608
No!

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:30.472
No!

01:18:30.504 --> 01:18:31.624
No!

01:18:31.655 --> 01:18:32.424
No!

01:18:32.456 --> 01:18:33.384
Not anymore.

01:18:33.416 --> 01:18:34.567
Mathias!

01:18:34.599 --> 01:18:35.432
No!

01:18:35.464 --> 01:18:36.232
No!
