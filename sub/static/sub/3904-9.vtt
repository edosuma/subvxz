00:19.000 --> 00:19.657
Hullo...

00:19.967 --> 00:21.210
<i>Hey, what are you doing ?</i>

00:21.949 --> 00:22.642
Oh, hi.

00:22.958 --> 00:23.932
<i>Are you sleeping ?</i>

00:24.014 --> 00:24.577
No.

00:25.218 --> 00:26.943
<i>What, you're not happy
to hear from me ?</i>

00:26.955 --> 00:27.986
No, I'm glad you called.

00:28.935 --> 00:30.144
<i>I want to see you.</i>

00:31.082 --> 00:31.729
Now ?

00:32.267 --> 00:33.289
<i>Yes, now.</i>

00:33.511 --> 00:34.226
Where are you ?

00:34.813 --> 00:35.849
<i>Same place as before.</i>

00:36.882 --> 00:37.609
Peabody.

00:37.925 --> 00:39.438
<i>Are you sure
you're not sleeping ?</i>

00:39.462 --> 00:40.777
No, no, I was up.

00:42.664 --> 00:43.404
<i>You liar.</i>

00:44.013 --> 00:45.655
<i>Come on, get
your ass over here.</i>

00:45.738 --> 00:48.106
Yeah, okay, I mean,
yeah, what the hell.

00:48.609 --> 00:49.278
<i>Room 210.</i>

00:49.654 --> 00:50.206
Fine.

01:14.731 --> 01:16.349
Sean, Seanie...

01:17.076 --> 01:17.580
What ?

01:17.977 --> 01:20.217
I have to go out and see
a friend for a little bit.

01:20.287 --> 01:22.107
I'll be gone for
an hour or two, okay ?

01:23.150 --> 01:25.508
I put my cell phone number
is on this slip of paper.

01:26.118 --> 01:28.299
I'll put it on that
top shelf, okay ?

01:32.892 --> 01:33.819
What did I just say ?

01:34.535 --> 01:35.966
You're going out
to see a friend

01:35.988 --> 01:37.525
and your number is
on the top shelf.

01:37.538 --> 01:38.102
Attaboy.

01:44.876 --> 01:46.659
<i>The Kerry camp had
an early opportunity</i>

01:46.672 --> 01:48.911
<i>to capitalize on jobs
and the economy as an issue</i>

01:48.924 --> 01:50.386
<i>and attack
the president with it.</i>

01:50.409 --> 01:52.849
<i>The pre-election polls show
that a significant number</i>

01:52.874 --> 01:56.253
<i>of undecided and persuadable
voters thought Kerry over Bush</i>

01:56.261 --> 01:57.728
<i>offered a better
chance for jobs.</i>

01:57.750 --> 01:59.768
<i>Jobs may have been
a marginal issue, Kate</i>

01:59.774 --> 02:02.085
<i>in some of the rust belt
battle ground states.</i>

02:02.906 --> 02:05.006
<i>But ultimately
this was a referendum</i>

02:05.229 --> 02:07.071
<i>on the leadership of George W. Bush</i>

02:07.225 --> 02:09.288
<i>on the war against terror
and the war in Iraq.</i>

02:09.429 --> 02:10.497
You are so full of shit.

02:10.717 --> 02:13.105
Nothing mattered in the red
states but the economy...

02:13.187 --> 02:15.123
I've been saying that for months.

02:15.909 --> 02:17.796
Hey, I'm not tossing you
so quick tonight.

02:17.879 --> 02:19.287
I got nothing to do tomorrow.

02:19.427 --> 02:21.564
Well, I'm tossing myself.

02:22.335 --> 02:23.449
I gotta get home.

02:28.587 --> 02:30.522
You know what, not that
this wasn't fun

02:30.547 --> 02:32.787
but it might be nice
to have dinner first.

02:33.524 --> 02:34.475
Dinner and a movie.

02:34.674 --> 02:35.753
I got to Baltimore late.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.279
Nah, I'm saying next time.

02:37.489 --> 02:39.401
We talk some, then
we fuck our brains out.

02:40.117 --> 02:41.525
It's different for girls like me.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.474
You need to be cuddled, McNulty ?

02:45.848 --> 02:47.008
No, but we make a date

02:47.091 --> 02:49.061
I don't feel like I have
to charge by the hour.

02:49.085 --> 02:50.258
A date, huh ?

02:51.453 --> 02:52.205
I'll call you.

02:53.532 --> 02:54.562
In the daytime.

03:00.953 --> 03:04.052
<i>I think we can all agree that
foreign policy and women...</i>

03:19.328 --> 03:21.870
<i>...all the while the United States
was reeling from the attack</i>

03:21.872 --> 03:22.617
<i>on Pearl Harbor...</i>

03:22.623 --> 03:23.947
<i>the wonders of
wood carving...</i>

03:25.062 --> 03:26.738
<i>he wrapped himself
in the american flag</i>

03:26.773 --> 03:28.837
<i>at the convention
and never looked back.</i>

03:28.978 --> 03:31.241
<i>Oh, Kate, that's a little
harsh, don't you think ?</i>

03:31.265 --> 03:32.636
<i>No, I don't, I'm serious.</i>

03:33.013 --> 03:35.666
<i>And I think it was great
strategy by his handlers, too.</i>

03:36.130 --> 03:39.144
<i>You don't think when John Kerry
in his acceptance speech</i>

03:39.156 --> 03:41.150
<i>at the Democratic
National Convention said:</i>

03:41.244 --> 03:43.005
<i>"I'm here under old glory"</i>

03:43.110 --> 03:45.360
<i>that he wasn't trying to wrap
himself in a flag, too ?</i>

03:45.418 --> 03:47.893
<i>No, I don't think he was trying
to wrap himself in a flag.</i>

03:47.915 --> 03:49.840
<i>I think he was trying
to defend the people</i>

03:49.875 --> 03:51.964
<i>in the battle ground states.
The ones who really...</i>

03:54.204 --> 03:59.140
<i>1942, the U.S. first stormed
the shore at Guadalcanal.</i>

03:59.858 --> 04:02.707
<i>Seizing a nearly complete
airfield at Moga Point</i>

04:03.271 --> 04:04.972
<i>which was renamed
Henderson Field.</i>

04:05.741 --> 04:07.806
<i>And in anchorage
and nearby Tulagy</i>

04:08.192 --> 04:10.832
<i>that would later be known
as "iron bottom sound"</i>

04:11.184 --> 04:13.636
<i>because of the number
of ships sunk there in battle.</i>

04:14.386 --> 04:17.514
<i>The landings of the first day
put nearly 11,000 marines</i>

04:17.526 --> 04:19.613
on the island,
minimal resistance...

05:52.379 --> 05:53.458
Slapstick

06:02.491 --> 06:03.851
Deep into it, I see.

06:05.202 --> 06:06.704
Yeah, gettin' there.

06:07.958 --> 06:08.814
You lookin' correct.

06:09.306 --> 06:11.863
Sunday morning. I'm on my way
to hear the word, you know ?

06:14.682 --> 06:16.242
Gracias, amigos.

06:17.862 --> 06:19.516
You payin' those guys
out of pocket ?

06:21.487 --> 06:23.835
Boiler in there's working
and the pipes are okay.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.496
I should have it all cleaned
out by tomorrow, I think.

06:27.235 --> 06:28.726
All you gonna need is the permits.

06:31.013 --> 06:31.646
Permits ?

06:32.432 --> 06:32.761
Yeah.

06:33.681 --> 06:34.125
Permits.

06:43.247 --> 06:44.232
Whoa, is that him ?

06:45.241 --> 06:45.652
Shit.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.186
If it ain't, we'd only
be wasting the bullet.

06:48.832 --> 06:51.353
Only problem is it bein' Sunday
mornin' an all, you know ?

06:55.307 --> 06:56.048
Who you callin' ?

06:56.808 --> 06:57.934
Slim Charles, man.

06:57.991 --> 07:00.116
You told me you was supposed
to bring our beefin'

07:00.127 --> 07:01.148
before the group, right ?

07:01.170 --> 07:04.011
Here it is you go warrin' with the
young boy, Marlo, over corners.

07:04.023 --> 07:05.149
Marlo ain't in the group.

07:05.841 --> 07:06.896
Be that as it may

07:07.154 --> 07:09.557
all this shoot-em-up shit
is bad f business.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.011
We got cops on half
the Westside corners.

07:12.256 --> 07:13.760
And what corners
they ain't holding

07:13.817 --> 07:15.635
I cat have my people
standing on for fear

07:15.647 --> 07:17.780
they gonna be mistaken
as one of Barksdale people

07:17.781 --> 07:18.573
an' catch a bullet.

07:18.591 --> 07:21.077
Look, man, I tried to talk
to the young buck myself, but...

07:21.091 --> 07:22.216
You try talkin' to Avon.

07:22.239 --> 07:24.187
Because that's half
the problem right there.

07:24.422 --> 07:25.313
No doubt, exactly.

07:30.152 --> 07:31.430
Nigger probably sleepin' in.

07:40.149 --> 07:42.516
Fact is, Stringer, your man
needs to reconcile himself

07:42.553 --> 07:43.985
to this new way of thinking.

07:44.394 --> 07:47.410
Now, you could remind him that
like everyone else in this room

07:47.504 --> 07:51.024
he benefiting from my connect
and from the wholesale price

07:51.030 --> 07:52.451
we got by throwin' in together.

07:52.462 --> 07:53.928
I mean, he know that, come on, Joe.

07:53.951 --> 07:56.872
Well, so, now we comin' to him
for help with a little something.

07:57.421 --> 08:00.567
He need to just back the fuck off
and let the youngun keep his corners.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.638
You said yourself it can't
be about territory no more.

08:04.015 --> 08:04.939
Old habits die hard.

08:04.940 --> 08:05.481
Who this ?

08:05.597 --> 08:06.372
Yeah, it's me.

08:06.852 --> 08:09.871
We on the house where
the dude who is, you know...

08:10.343 --> 08:10.964
Talk, nigga.

08:11.246 --> 08:13.133
Shit, man, I'm tryin'
not to use names.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.009
This Gerard, man.

08:15.034 --> 08:17.193
We on Omar, he goin'
to come out the house.

08:18.436 --> 08:21.589
As you know, I ain't trying to lose
no niggers on them corners either but

08:22.127 --> 08:23.746
it's a two way street, you know ?

08:25.869 --> 08:27.947
Gerard and Sapper
got their sights on omar.

08:28.145 --> 08:30.220
They tried to raise Slim
an' he ain't answering.

08:30.384 --> 08:30.759
So ?

08:31.006 --> 08:33.446
It's church day, String.
Sunday morning, you know ?

08:34.034 --> 08:34.937
They sure it's him ?

08:35.006 --> 08:35.722
Omar, yeah.

08:37.304 --> 08:38.044
Alright, do it.

08:40.042 --> 08:40.486
Do it.

08:42.808 --> 08:44.148
They right there, c'mon.

08:53.559 --> 08:54.519
Oh, my goodness !

09:07.696 --> 09:09.069
This time, I definitely hit him.

09:11.062 --> 09:13.359
District-wide, it's 14%.

09:13.980 --> 09:16.748
A drop like that in the western
felony rate is unheard of.

09:18.262 --> 09:21.054
But God knows what happens
when you let go of your secret.

09:21.806 --> 09:23.109
Hey, what happens, happens.

09:23.684 --> 09:26.053
I mean, if they want to keep
my little experiment going

09:26.076 --> 09:27.987
or they want to go back
to business as usual.

09:27.988 --> 09:29.219
That's on them. But me ?

09:29.337 --> 09:30.944
I'm out of here, D., I'm gone.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.655
And... Hopkins came through.

09:33.252 --> 09:35.605
I got the contract offer
on that security job yesterday.

09:35.623 --> 09:36.676
You really gonna retire ?

09:36.689 --> 09:37.509
Always planned to.

09:45.019 --> 09:45.301
What ?

09:46.813 --> 09:47.939
You started something.

09:48.232 --> 09:49.418
You ain't gonna finish it ?

09:50.332 --> 09:51.083
What do you mean ?

09:51.095 --> 09:53.922
On a battlefield, you can't do much
to help anybody with anything.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.629
But you managed a truce, Bunny.

09:55.957 --> 09:57.624
And making the game street legal...

09:58.551 --> 09:59.781
takes the heart out of it.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.070
Keep it going, we gonna
reach some of those people

10:02.092 --> 10:03.759
chasing dope and coke

10:04.146 --> 10:06.012
and maybe even
some hoppers, too.

10:07.759 --> 10:08.780
You might at that.

10:10.106 --> 10:13.001
But what happens when you turn
your district over to the next man ?

10:13.235 --> 10:14.834
Or people get wind of this thing

10:15.314 --> 10:16.865
and there's no one to defend it ?

10:17.299 --> 10:17.932
What then ?

10:21.802 --> 10:23.293
How's the contrast on that ?

10:23.504 --> 10:24.361
Good for daylight.

10:24.478 --> 10:24.877
Yeah ?

10:26.426 --> 10:28.373
On a Sunday,
what the fuck, Lester ?

10:29.381 --> 10:30.789
I could say the same of you.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.592
Elena's taking the kids
to her mother's

10:33.616 --> 10:35.153
what the fuck else
am I gonna do ?

10:35.234 --> 10:36.395
No life

10:36.608 --> 10:38.201
no marriage, no kids.

10:39.586 --> 10:40.336
No problem.

10:41.756 --> 10:42.799
What's with the video ?

10:43.749 --> 10:45.332
Gonna put it up
in one of the windows

10:45.357 --> 10:46.823
across from Stringer's print shop.

10:46.882 --> 10:47.985
Catch him coming and going.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.344
Hey, you need help ?

10:49.497 --> 10:50.774
You're a known face.

10:51.268 --> 10:53.213
I figure me and Prez
do it on a Sunday

10:53.343 --> 10:56.218
shop is closed, looking
like working men...

10:59.871 --> 11:01.020
you know something, Lester ?

11:01.021 --> 11:02.956
I do believe there
aren't five swingin' dicks

11:02.980 --> 11:05.022
in this entire department
who can do what we do.

11:05.044 --> 11:07.167
I'm not sayin' like
all chest out and shit.

11:07.190 --> 11:08.868
It's just, you think about it

11:09.595 --> 11:11.837
there's maybe, what,
3,000 sworns, right ?

11:12.611 --> 11:15.180
100 or so are bosses,
so not a fucking clue there ?

11:15.227 --> 11:18.018
A few more hundred is
sergeants and lieutenants

11:18.053 --> 11:19.777
and most of them
wanna be bosses one day

11:19.813 --> 11:20.962
so they're just as fucked...

11:21.468 --> 11:25.139
then there's 600 or 700
fuckin' housecats, you know ?

11:25.573 --> 11:26.405
Deskmen...

11:27.238 --> 11:28.447
and in the patrol division ?

11:28.483 --> 11:30.699
There's probably a little
bit of talent there, but...

11:31.380 --> 11:34.393
the way the city is right now,
that's 1500 guys...

11:34.954 --> 11:36.820
chasin' calls and clearin' corners...

11:38.520 --> 11:42.679
I mean, nobody's knowing his post,
nobody's building nothing, right ?

11:43.126 --> 11:44.534
And C.I.D. is the same.

11:46.001 --> 11:48.041
Catching calls,
chasing quick clearances

11:48.054 --> 11:49.813
keeping everything
in the shallow end...

11:49.825 --> 11:52.569
I mean who is it out there that
can do what we do with a case ?

11:53.414 --> 11:54.587
How many are there really ?

11:56.206 --> 11:57.731
Don Worden, Ed Burns.

11:57.896 --> 11:59.315
Gary Childs out in the county

11:59.902 --> 12:02.273
John O'Neil and Steve Cleary
over at Woodlawn...

12:02.660 --> 12:04.512
oh, they bring it in,
but there's not many.

12:05.169 --> 12:05.991
There's not many.

12:07.187 --> 12:08.361
We're good at this, Lester.

12:08.537 --> 12:10.403
In this town, we're
as good as it gets.

12:12.885 --> 12:14.328
Natural police.

12:14.762 --> 12:16.674
Fuck yes, natural police.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.199
Tell me something, Jimmy.

12:19.103 --> 12:21.049
How exactly do you
think it all ends ?

12:22.176 --> 12:22.961
What do you mean ?

12:23.607 --> 12:24.615
A parade ?

12:25.108 --> 12:26.222
A gold watch ?

12:26.880 --> 12:29.600
A shining Jimmy-McNulty-day moment

12:30.011 --> 12:31.068
when you bring in a case

12:31.079 --> 12:33.601
so sweet that everybody
gets together and says:

12:33.624 --> 12:38.700
"Oh shit, he was right all along.
We shoulda listened to the man."

12:40.437 --> 12:43.218
The job will not save you, Jimmy.

12:44.417 --> 12:46.716
It won't make you whole,
it won't fill your ass up.

12:47.701 --> 12:48.452
I dunno.

12:48.933 --> 12:50.341
- A good case...
- ends.

12:51.195 --> 12:52.499
They all end.

12:53.837 --> 12:55.775
The handcuffs go
click and it's over

12:56.049 --> 12:58.594
and the next morning it's just
you in the room with yourself.

12:59.192 --> 13:00.391
Until the next case.

13:00.707 --> 13:03.615
Boy, you need something
outside of this here.

13:08.004 --> 13:09.857
Like what ?
Dollhouse miniatures ?

13:12.579 --> 13:15.455
A life, a life, Jimmy,
you know what that is ?

13:17.638 --> 13:20.277
It's the shit that happens
while you're waiting for moments

13:20.301 --> 13:21.015
that never come.

13:27.281 --> 13:28.537
On a Sunday morning...

13:28.783 --> 13:29.934
we called to ask.

13:30.426 --> 13:31.610
Shamrock said to go.

13:32.830 --> 13:34.261
On a Sunday morning

13:34.707 --> 13:35.783
y'all try to hit a nigger

13:35.794 --> 13:38.335
when he takin' his
wrinkled-ass grandmoms to pray.

13:39.595 --> 13:41.484
And you all don't hit
the nigger, neither.

13:41.778 --> 13:43.573
All y'all kill is
grandma's crown ?

13:43.677 --> 13:46.563
By the time sham tells us to go,
omar's damn near in the cab...

13:46.621 --> 13:49.436
Ain't enough that y'all violated
the Sunday morning truce.

13:49.859 --> 13:50.611
No !

13:51.338 --> 13:53.976
I'm standin' here holdin'
a torn-up church crown

13:54.293 --> 13:56.088
of a bona-fide colored lady.

13:56.804 --> 13:58.530
Do you know what
a colored lady is ?

13:59.421 --> 14:00.992
Not your mamas, for sure.

14:01.956 --> 14:03.129
'Cause if they was that

14:03.222 --> 14:05.684
y'all would have known better
better than that bullshit.

14:07.261 --> 14:10.133
Y'all triflin' with Avon
Barksdale's reputation here.

14:11.060 --> 14:11.871
You know that ?

14:12.950 --> 14:14.098
She alright though ?

14:14.463 --> 14:16.329
She got cut on her
face from the glass

14:16.892 --> 14:18.576
an' she sore from
where I fell on her.

14:18.577 --> 14:19.750
But other an' that though...

14:19.785 --> 14:20.838
you saved her ass, huh.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.303
I damn near got
that woman kilt, yo.

14:24.099 --> 14:26.961
Y'all shoulda seen me in Sinai
hospital while they stitchin' her up

14:27.055 --> 14:29.695
lyin' about why somebody want
to shoot me down in the street.

14:29.905 --> 14:31.688
That woman thinks
I work in a cafeteria.

14:31.958 --> 14:32.732
Cafeteria ?

14:32.825 --> 14:34.022
At the airport, yeah.

14:34.162 --> 14:35.496
Airport, why the airport ?

14:35.543 --> 14:37.655
'Cause I know she ain't
never gonna go down there

14:37.667 --> 14:38.828
to go dining that's why.

14:39.367 --> 14:41.938
Yo, Kimmy, this ain't funny, yo.
That woman raised me.

14:42.512 --> 14:44.518
An for as long as I've been
grown, once a month

14:44.552 --> 14:46.152
I been with her on a church Sunday.

14:46.293 --> 14:47.912
Tellin' myself ain't
no need to worry

14:47.925 --> 14:49.601
'cause there's ain't
nobody in this city

14:49.626 --> 14:51.971
that low-down to disrespect
a Sunday morning.

14:57.827 --> 14:59.621
Y'all know I was gonna
walk away, right ?

15:00.010 --> 15:01.065
Y'all knew that, right ?

15:01.287 --> 15:04.113
I mean, after Tosha, I was
gonna leave them people be, yo.

15:04.185 --> 15:05.335
Avon home now.

15:05.369 --> 15:06.812
Oh, Barksdale's gots to go.

15:06.918 --> 15:09.010
Stringer too.
This thing got to end, man.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.647
I swear to god, yo,
on a Sunday morning

15:12.670 --> 15:14.712
they near shot her
best crown off, yo.

15:15.334 --> 15:17.644
I mean, no shame them
niggers. Y'all feel me ?

15:21.227 --> 15:21.838
I'm out.

15:27.654 --> 15:30.249
If you back to dealin' with
Barksdale people, I'm out, yo.

15:32.900 --> 15:34.026
I'm in it for the money.

15:34.965 --> 15:36.278
It's easier out there than that.

15:46.858 --> 15:47.971
Jus' you an' me then.

15:48.593 --> 15:49.625
Like it was.

15:52.966 --> 15:53.717
Naw, yo.

15:54.374 --> 15:55.407
This one about me.

15:57.225 --> 15:58.199
And nobody else.

15:58.797 --> 15:59.231
Hey...

16:00.661 --> 16:01.494
I'm with you.

16:07.292 --> 16:08.477
Not on this one you ain't.

16:13.815 --> 16:14.929
Okay, guys.

16:15.152 --> 16:16.663
We are maybe a step and a half away

16:16.664 --> 16:18.554
from being up on a
wire on these people.

16:18.707 --> 16:20.442
All we need is to firm up the P.C.

16:20.443 --> 16:23.316
showing the disposable phones
are being used in a drug conspiracy.

16:23.911 --> 16:26.011
McNulty and Greggs,
you're on that angle.

16:26.081 --> 16:28.416
You need to walk either
undercover or a wired C.I.

16:28.474 --> 16:29.906
up to one of the Barksdale crews...

16:29.953 --> 16:32.533
Lester, you and Prez
start typing affidavits

16:32.956 --> 16:34.688
because when the probable
cause comes in

16:34.712 --> 16:36.882
we're going to want to get
the application in fast.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.733
Detective, you're the chaser
on our boy Bernard.

16:40.037 --> 16:42.360
When he goes out for cell
phones, we're right behind.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.456
The faster we get a hold
of the new numbers

16:44.480 --> 16:46.157
the faster we're up
on those phones.

16:46.966 --> 16:48.832
Now, when Caroline
comes back off vacation

16:48.842 --> 16:50.332
she's going to be on the mini-cam.

16:50.754 --> 16:51.740
From here on out

16:52.020 --> 16:54.354
we keep a log on any
movement by Stringer

16:54.365 --> 16:56.500
and we keep an eye out
for Mr. Barksdale as well.

16:56.617 --> 16:58.762
Try to get a line on where
he spends his days.

16:58.868 --> 17:01.826
As for me, I'm off to do battle
with the wireless company.

17:01.966 --> 17:02.704
They a problem ?

17:03.232 --> 17:05.261
Have been since the damn
things were invented.

17:06.165 --> 17:06.904
Okay, then.

17:07.338 --> 17:08.873
Remember that with this wire

17:08.957 --> 17:10.646
everything is a race
against the clock.

17:11.057 --> 17:12.933
Anything we get up on
is only temporary.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.329
You reach Bubbles ?

17:16.448 --> 17:18.477
Yeah. He'll be waiting
at Mount Clare.

17:18.981 --> 17:21.034
Lee, where's the DNR log ?

17:21.492 --> 17:21.901
What ?

17:22.347 --> 17:23.146
The log.

17:24.512 --> 17:26.075
Never mind, I got it right here.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.220
All Stringer, all the time.

17:32.183 --> 17:33.848
Theresa D'Agostino please.

17:33.929 --> 17:34.694
<i>Hold please.</i>

17:34.939 --> 17:35.820
Yeah, I'll hold.

17:37.391 --> 17:39.080
<i>I'm sorry, she's not
in the office now.</i>

17:39.093 --> 17:40.312
<i>You want to leave a message ?</i>

17:40.339 --> 17:41.370
No, I left one already.

17:58.433 --> 17:59.174
A boxing gym ?

17:59.489 --> 18:01.250
For kids an' all. An athletic club.

18:01.485 --> 18:04.587
Gyms, reducing salons,
public baths are permitted

18:04.598 --> 18:09.772
only in properties zoned
b-two, b-three, b-four or b-five...

18:09.831 --> 18:12.834
all signed and sealed by a
registered architect and engineer...

18:12.869 --> 18:15.625
floor framing plan,
including the load criteria...

18:15.638 --> 18:17.562
hydronic piping
and equipment layouts...

18:17.598 --> 18:19.427
six copies of your
fire protection plan

18:19.438 --> 18:21.902
with emergency exits
and sprinkler system...

18:21.925 --> 18:24.996
health department, since it's a
physical culture and health service...

18:25.019 --> 18:27.921
a license from the State Athletic
Commission, up on Calvert Street.

18:36.403 --> 18:37.692
Mid-size or full ?

18:37.763 --> 18:38.467
Mid-sized.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.458
You should upgrade an' get
one of them escalades.

18:41.482 --> 18:43.276
They got that XM radio an' all...

18:44.510 --> 18:46.904
I'm sayin' if we gonna be
in the damn car all damn day

18:46.928 --> 18:48.545
it's worth it, Bernard.

19:14.982 --> 19:16.028
You ticklish, bubs ?

19:16.920 --> 19:17.836
Chills, Kima.

19:18.703 --> 19:19.548
You do that to me.

19:21.506 --> 19:22.833
Here's the buy money, Bubs.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.051
Remember, this is all on tape.

19:25.496 --> 19:26.245
I hear you.

19:26.317 --> 19:27.706
So down there on Vincent Street

19:27.729 --> 19:29.699
they don't even hide
the ground stash anymore.

19:29.723 --> 19:32.058
You watch and wait,
see when they're runnin' low.

19:32.868 --> 19:33.981
Then ask for 30 or so.

19:34.099 --> 19:36.327
Enough so that they have
to call for a quick re-up.

19:36.351 --> 19:37.465
That's the important thing.

19:37.536 --> 19:39.067
We want him to use his burner.

19:39.806 --> 19:41.061
I get to keep the 30 ?

19:41.261 --> 19:42.423
30 would kill you, Bubs.

19:43.033 --> 19:44.065
You get to keep the money

19:44.088 --> 19:46.657
we hand you once you come back
here with all of that product.

19:46.680 --> 19:47.818
Just asking.

19:48.276 --> 19:48.898
Just telling.

19:54.212 --> 19:54.938
It can't be done.

19:56.194 --> 19:57.226
Excuse me ?

19:57.754 --> 19:59.733
The activation information
you're gonna want ?

19:59.979 --> 20:02.168
That stuff's not accessible
from the business office

20:02.177 --> 20:03.209
until it goes to billing

20:03.556 --> 20:06.032
and that takes a few days,
sometimes a week or more.

20:06.513 --> 20:09.211
But more than that,
we have dozens of

20:09.236 --> 20:10.932
law enforcement
inquiries every month.

20:11.330 --> 20:13.032
We get to them
in the order received

20:13.360 --> 20:15.079
and currently the
turnaround's 30 days.

20:15.294 --> 20:16.116
30 days.

20:16.574 --> 20:17.947
Let me understand something.

20:18.392 --> 20:21.681
Your company is in business
selling disposable cell phones

20:21.705 --> 20:24.344
to people who don't have to give
any subscriber information

20:24.368 --> 20:25.999
at the time of purchase, correct ?

20:26.266 --> 20:26.807
Correct.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.214
They buy these phones
and as far as you're concerned

20:29.236 --> 20:32.109
they use them anonymously,
prepaying for their minutes...

20:32.188 --> 20:33.655
From the retailers, yes.

20:33.665 --> 20:35.859
And while they are using
these phones, anonymously

20:35.919 --> 20:37.314
for whatever purpose

20:37.479 --> 20:39.473
they can't be monitored
by law enforcement

20:39.501 --> 20:42.000
because your company
can't react within a month

20:42.258 --> 20:43.842
to a court order for a wiretap.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.237
We do the best we can.

20:45.485 --> 20:46.492
This is bullshit.

20:47.466 --> 20:50.435
You're selling a phone that you know
is effective for drug trafficking.

20:50.469 --> 20:53.790
Lieutenant, our prepaid inventory
is there for young people

20:53.872 --> 20:55.479
college students and such

20:55.515 --> 20:57.742
people who can't afford
a permanent cell phone plan.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.889
What college student
can't afford a cell phone ?

21:00.134 --> 21:01.703
They can afford
the fucking college

21:01.728 --> 21:03.569
they can afford the phone
that goes with it.

21:03.580 --> 21:04.578
I resent the suggestion.

21:04.601 --> 21:05.692
Just so I'm clear:

21:05.892 --> 21:08.390
You're telling me that
even if by some miracle

21:08.401 --> 21:11.858
we are able to get up on a drug
dealer's disposable cell phone

21:11.859 --> 21:13.278
in time to catch him talking

21:13.713 --> 21:16.727
you're gonna take as much
as a month to activate our tap.

21:17.149 --> 21:18.764
Look, if you have
a problem with that

21:18.765 --> 21:20.673
your office can contact
our general counsel.

21:20.782 --> 21:21.697
That's all I can say.

21:25.239 --> 21:26.235
How about this ?

21:26.658 --> 21:28.708
How about the state's attorney
for Baltimore city

21:28.720 --> 21:30.773
calls a press conference
on the courthouse steps

21:30.808 --> 21:34.080
to declare that Bay Wireless is
in league with the most violent

21:34.163 --> 21:35.583
drug traffickers in the city

21:35.629 --> 21:38.926
preventing their apprehension
and arrest by law enforcement.

21:43.149 --> 21:44.404
Four to five days turnaround.

21:44.745 --> 21:45.706
Best we can do.

21:47.895 --> 21:51.873
I swear, I felt like a damn balloon
with air rushin' out my ass

21:51.890 --> 21:53.147
goin' from desk to desk.

21:55.902 --> 21:57.110
This our new man, huh ?

21:57.847 --> 21:58.409
Frank Reid.

21:58.741 --> 21:59.737
Dennis Wise.

22:00.077 --> 22:01.812
Reverend, our man
Dennis spent all day

22:01.813 --> 22:03.913
down at the Benton building,
trying for permits.

22:04.182 --> 22:05.086
On the new gym ?

22:05.461 --> 22:05.824
Yeah.

22:06.598 --> 22:07.643
You use my name ?

22:09.144 --> 22:10.528
You use anybody's name ?

22:11.079 --> 22:13.777
Hell, man. There was a time
I'da used Smith and Wesson.

22:15.420 --> 22:16.886
Naw, look, man,
I'm just sayin'...

22:16.898 --> 22:19.068
how do regular folk
get it done in this town ?

22:24.892 --> 22:25.643
Doreen

22:26.558 --> 22:28.236
ring Delegate Watkins, please ?

22:47.793 --> 22:49.154
<i>Yellow tops, yellow tops.</i>

22:49.353 --> 22:50.585
Obliged, man, obliged.

22:52.222 --> 22:53.418
Keep me close, you know ?

22:54.134 --> 22:55.319
You tell a friend, okay ?

22:56.011 --> 22:57.512
Too hot for them
black tees, right ?

22:58.780 --> 23:00.143
Sup, hopper, what you hawkin' ?

23:00.281 --> 23:00.996
Body bags.

23:01.618 --> 23:03.225
Alright, let me get 30... 30 pills.

23:05.003 --> 23:05.483
30 ?

23:06.975 --> 23:09.426
Where the fuck your raggedy-ass
come up with three-hunnert

23:09.438 --> 23:10.634
in motherfucking cash, man ?

23:10.658 --> 23:12.639
I've been sellin' them
t-shirts for weeks now.

23:12.651 --> 23:15.021
You know, I might be raggedy,
but I'm in a cash business.

23:15.043 --> 23:16.124
You want my money or no ?

23:24.406 --> 23:25.567
Yeah, we out.

23:27.238 --> 23:27.542
A-ight.

23:29.818 --> 23:30.639
Shouldn't be long.

23:31.519 --> 23:33.784
A bulk purchase justify
a discount, right ?

23:34.969 --> 23:35.774
250 or so...

23:37.145 --> 23:38.003
275.

23:38.577 --> 23:39.820
And a couple of them whiteys.

23:39.926 --> 23:40.631
That'll work.

23:41.711 --> 23:42.484
<i>That'll work.</i>

23:42.519 --> 23:44.079
Bubs just made another 25.

23:45.267 --> 23:46.463
Theresa D'Agostino, please.

23:46.791 --> 23:49.209
<i>I'm sorry, but she's not in.
Can I take a message ?</i>

23:49.514 --> 23:51.143
No, I'll call back.

23:54.745 --> 23:56.329
- So, how's that working ?
- What ?

23:57.451 --> 23:58.179
Your new hope.

23:59.421 --> 24:00.605
So far, so good.

24:17.455 --> 24:18.592
You got the receipts, man ?

24:18.615 --> 24:19.506
Yeah, most of 'em.

24:19.518 --> 24:21.631
A few blew out the damn
window on the interstate.

24:22.745 --> 24:24.117
What, y'all waiting to see Avon ?

24:24.456 --> 24:26.968
I heard y'all shot a crown off
an ol' lady's head yesterday.

24:33.058 --> 24:34.617
Good, you all made it.

24:35.638 --> 24:36.295
Yeah...

24:37.350 --> 24:38.396
we puttin' in some work.

24:38.490 --> 24:39.780
C'mon upstairs so we can talk.

24:49.293 --> 24:50.372
Back with numbers.

24:50.466 --> 24:50.888
How many ?

24:51.711 --> 24:53.153
24 Trac phones.

24:53.351 --> 24:56.250
Two each from Mondo Marts
in Catonsville and Sykesville

24:56.332 --> 24:57.657
and four from Frederick

24:57.693 --> 25:00.849
and then eight each from two stops
over the river in west Virginia.

25:01.800 --> 25:02.983
Those bumper beepers ?

25:04.028 --> 25:05.061
They work great.

25:05.998 --> 25:07.653
He went out I-70 this time.

25:07.864 --> 25:09.681
Can you blame him ?
The scenery's better.

25:10.655 --> 25:11.298
24.

25:13.432 --> 25:15.038
We're gonna have
a lot of D.N.R.'s up.

25:15.636 --> 25:16.410
But with any luck

25:16.433 --> 25:18.991
one of these phones leads
to young Mr. Bodie Broadus.

25:20.082 --> 25:21.207
You want to call Pearlman.

25:21.208 --> 25:21.654
A'ight.

25:23.178 --> 25:23.964
Who's hungry ?

25:24.263 --> 25:25.543
How 'bout chinese ?

25:25.858 --> 25:26.762
Sounds good to me.

25:27.441 --> 25:28.826
You guys call it in and I'll go.

25:28.897 --> 25:30.210
Let me get some of that lo mein.

25:30.234 --> 25:32.404
You take a turn typing
this shit, I'll go with him.

25:32.427 --> 25:33.471
Make mine sweet and sour.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.269
Lo mein for me.

25:40.093 --> 25:41.231
So y'all get with Charles

25:41.301 --> 25:43.016
he gonna get you
all the details on it.

25:46.488 --> 25:47.015
Who they ?

25:47.884 --> 25:48.917
Eastside niggas.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.675
Willing to soldier up
for us on retainer.

25:52.002 --> 25:53.315
Milton put me up on them.

25:54.875 --> 25:56.881
Man, we gonna be back
where we was, String.

25:57.022 --> 25:59.601
You know, I can smell it.
We just got to get this boy Marlo

25:59.837 --> 26:01.349
and then we spread out like we do.

26:02.652 --> 26:05.913
Them co-op boys, man, they ain't
happy about this situation, man.

26:06.464 --> 26:09.888
They say they got cops on corners
where they wouldn't have otherwise.

26:09.910 --> 26:10.931
Everybody nervous.

26:10.942 --> 26:12.255
Man, fuck them niggers.

26:12.525 --> 26:14.296
I mean, Prop Joe said he'd mediate.

26:14.519 --> 26:16.641
You know what I mean ?
Go to Marlo and talk on it.

26:16.671 --> 26:19.052
Yeah, well, he take a gun
with him, maybe it could work.

26:19.053 --> 26:20.415
Lemme ask you, something though.

26:20.438 --> 26:22.149
Did you tell them
discount ass niggers

26:22.150 --> 26:23.909
they could pop off
at Omar's grandma.

26:24.014 --> 26:24.613
Oh, man.

26:24.988 --> 26:26.912
Sham comes to me
in the middle of the meeting

26:26.924 --> 26:28.967
and talk about they got
their sights on Omar.

26:29.671 --> 26:33.213
They say nothing about no grandma.
No church hat, nothing like that.

26:33.238 --> 26:35.146
I hear the cocksucker's
name, I say, "go."

26:35.431 --> 26:36.499
On a Sunday morning ?

26:36.545 --> 26:39.228
Yo, I don't give a fuck, man.
I hear that cocksucker's name, man

26:39.250 --> 26:40.845
I ain't thinkin'
about a church day.

26:40.882 --> 26:43.604
A Sunday truce been around
long as the game itself, man.

26:43.628 --> 26:45.926
I mean, you know what I'm sayin',
you can do some shit

26:45.935 --> 26:49.522
and be like what the fuck, but hey,
just never on no Sunday, man.

26:51.047 --> 26:53.347
I mean, it's just like people
was talkin' on us and all

26:53.359 --> 26:55.365
and the stories are
getting bigger and bigger.

26:55.380 --> 26:58.300
Like, I swear to god, Fatface Rick
heard that our people went an' shot

26:58.335 --> 27:01.033
Omar granny's in the ass
on purpose, and all that.

27:01.104 --> 27:03.778
And pulled their dicks out and
pissed on her crown an' shit.

27:05.597 --> 27:06.946
I heard the same bullshit.

27:07.502 --> 27:10.273
Prop Joe gave me an earful.
But yo, what can I say, man ?

27:10.295 --> 27:11.398
Good help is hard to find.

27:11.410 --> 27:14.119
If it wasn't, you think I'd be
payin' Eastside niggers for shit ?

27:15.749 --> 27:18.128
Yo, we still off them corners ?

27:19.560 --> 27:20.428
Yeah, got to be.

27:21.764 --> 27:23.993
We be off them corners
till we take care of Marlo.

27:24.144 --> 27:27.003
Yeah, maybe we should
put a couple more crews

27:27.015 --> 27:28.798
on them free zones them cops got.

27:29.490 --> 27:31.673
You know what I mean ?
Take the profit where we can.

27:31.684 --> 27:32.575
You trust that shit ?

27:33.140 --> 27:34.697
I mean, so far.

27:35.179 --> 27:36.281
An' if they runnin' a game

27:36.305 --> 27:38.509
they ain't gonna get nobody
higher than a crew chief

27:38.533 --> 27:39.987
to take a charge, right ?

27:42.239 --> 27:43.964
What you gonna do
with them two niggers

27:43.977 --> 27:45.137
you got waitin' downstairs ?

27:45.963 --> 27:47.605
I make 'em buy the lady a new hat.

27:50.151 --> 27:51.266
What're we waiting for ?

27:52.040 --> 27:52.886
Sweet-and-sour ?

27:57.456 --> 27:58.773
You do the cookie first ?

28:01.093 --> 28:02.033
What's the difference ?

28:08.072 --> 28:10.229
"A new friend makes himself known."

28:13.691 --> 28:14.418
Himself ?

28:17.871 --> 28:19.807
If it was herself,
then you'd have a fortune.

28:22.117 --> 28:24.535
Shit, I'm married with
lawn furniture, man.

28:28.674 --> 28:30.986
This technology's out
of control no question.

28:31.150 --> 28:32.487
But that's nothing new.

28:32.499 --> 28:35.125
The way these guys are
using disposables nowadays

28:35.137 --> 28:37.883
we cannot get
a working wire up in time.

28:38.024 --> 28:40.618
By the time we get subscriber
information and papers served...

28:40.642 --> 28:41.709
they're dumping phones.

28:41.722 --> 28:44.055
Cellular carrier is telling them
they need nearly a week

28:44.079 --> 28:45.134
to process the paperwork.

28:45.145 --> 28:48.302
They're only half-scared of us,
but a visit from the feds ?

28:48.654 --> 28:50.799
You all have profile
enough to push them.

28:51.233 --> 28:53.813
I dunno. If you've got
them down to five days

28:54.271 --> 28:55.924
you're doing about
as well as we can.

28:56.278 --> 28:57.274
Once again, guys:

28:57.567 --> 28:59.738
The bureau's a little busy
with counter terrorism.

29:00.020 --> 29:01.411
Our U.S. attorney here

29:01.471 --> 29:04.086
he only touches himself at the
mention of political corruption.

29:04.228 --> 29:06.232
Ghetto drug stuff
just doesn't rate.

29:07.523 --> 29:08.637
I'm sorry to say.

29:12.697 --> 29:14.842
Shit always smells best
in the car, going home.

29:15.968 --> 29:16.965
<i>Signal 13.</i>

29:16.966 --> 29:20.485
<i>In the alley in the rear,
Eastside, 800 north Montford.</i>

29:20.526 --> 29:21.993
That's five blocks,
up and over.

29:22.004 --> 29:22.403
Go.

29:57.486 --> 29:59.610
<i>What's the cross street ?
What's the cross street ?</i>

30:03.445 --> 30:04.102
<i>Shots fired.</i>

30:05.651 --> 30:07.259
<i>Sounded like it was
west of Milton...</i>

30:32.033 --> 30:32.842
I'm police.

30:34.367 --> 30:35.669
He's ten-seven, call it in.

30:45.457 --> 30:46.196
That's a glock.

31:00.126 --> 31:01.687
I saw the gun as he turned.

31:02.472 --> 31:03.352
It's Derrick.

31:04.325 --> 31:05.135
Jesus christ.

31:05.967 --> 31:06.824
You killed Derrick.

31:07.926 --> 31:08.746
It's Waggoner.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.187
You fuckin' killed Waggoner !

31:21.190 --> 31:21.905
Greggs.

31:21.929 --> 31:22.997
<i>Prez shot another cop.</i>

31:24.319 --> 31:24.834
What ?

31:24.858 --> 31:27.722
<i>It was an accident in
an alley, a little while ago.</i>

31:27.744 --> 31:29.275
<i>- No.
- I'll call you back.</i>

31:38.998 --> 31:40.183
You here for Barksdale ?

31:40.301 --> 31:41.660
I'm here for peace, man.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.843
This some senseless shit goin' on.

31:43.925 --> 31:45.179
But Barksdale ain't sent you ?

31:45.191 --> 31:46.798
Naw, Stringer knows I'm here, man.

31:47.185 --> 31:48.898
If I can bring something
respectful back

31:48.899 --> 31:50.459
they most likely to show the same.

31:52.266 --> 31:54.200
Tell the boy he can
come in with the co-op.

31:54.705 --> 31:56.530
If he takes our package,
which by the way

31:56.531 --> 31:58.583
is better than the best
he putting out there now

31:59.593 --> 32:00.754
he'll keep his corners.

32:01.013 --> 32:01.704
Guaranteed.

32:02.292 --> 32:03.078
He might listen.

32:03.864 --> 32:05.188
But the boy got ideas.

32:05.821 --> 32:07.757
And he's thinkin'
Avon weak right now.

32:08.437 --> 32:11.605
You ever know Avon Barksdale
to back down from anything ?

32:23.982 --> 32:26.527
A plainclothesman in a dark alley

32:27.022 --> 32:29.615
with his gun out,
and shots fired...

32:29.685 --> 32:32.135
Look, no one wants to burn
anybody, but the fact is

32:32.159 --> 32:33.860
there's a racial
component to consider.

32:34.729 --> 32:36.876
- The appearance of it...
- Has he seen a lawyer ?

32:46.030 --> 32:46.749
Lieutenant...

32:48.021 --> 32:48.384
What ?

32:49.195 --> 32:51.540
He's in a situation where
you can't compel a statement

32:51.552 --> 32:53.241
out of him until you
read him his rights

32:53.264 --> 32:54.788
and we haven't
done that yet, so...

32:54.813 --> 32:57.510
I'm his commanding officer.
I just want to know if he's alright.

32:57.687 --> 32:58.075
Okay.

32:59.523 --> 33:00.625
Okay, there's just...

33:02.162 --> 33:03.956
it's a legal question
at this point.

33:18.947 --> 33:19.981
Can I get you anything ?

33:28.683 --> 33:30.160
You should call the union, Roland.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.031
Talk to a lawyer before
you say anything further.

33:36.764 --> 33:39.545
I'm not saying anyone's gonna
charge anything criminally.

33:40.717 --> 33:42.560
Everyone knows you had
no intention of...

33:45.512 --> 33:46.696
but administratively...

33:47.975 --> 33:50.449
you need to be careful
because of the racial thing.

33:50.615 --> 33:51.552
You see that, right ?

33:53.241 --> 33:56.095
There's gonna be people in the
department who see this that way.

34:01.302 --> 34:02.286
You see that, right ?

34:02.404 --> 34:04.596
I wasn't scared, I wasn't angry.

34:08.138 --> 34:10.473
I didn't give a shit
he was black or...

34:11.118 --> 34:12.116
whatever...

34:19.761 --> 34:21.181
or, maybe I did.

34:22.155 --> 34:25.005
How the fuck do you know if
that's in your head or if it's not...

34:26.681 --> 34:27.598
But you saw the gun.

34:29.159 --> 34:29.534
Yeah.

34:30.882 --> 34:31.868
Yeah...

34:32.818 --> 34:34.108
He turned toward me and...

34:36.043 --> 34:37.179
'Cause you shouted, right ?

34:37.239 --> 34:39.469
You shouted, "police"
and he turned, right ?

34:44.476 --> 34:47.021
I don't think so.
I don't think I said anything.

34:48.051 --> 34:49.516
I don't think he did that.

34:49.705 --> 34:51.511
I was a couple steps in the alley...

34:52.532 --> 34:54.315
and he turned and I saw the gun.

34:54.445 --> 34:55.324
That's all.

34:58.385 --> 34:59.234
He have kids ?

35:00.677 --> 35:01.263
A wife ?

35:01.934 --> 35:02.601
I don't know.

35:03.481 --> 35:05.944
They won't say.
They won't talk to me about him.

35:06.448 --> 35:07.445
Call the F.O.P.

35:07.995 --> 35:09.111
Get a lawyer, Roland.

35:11.572 --> 35:12.358
No, sir.

35:14.657 --> 35:15.373
I'm done.

35:26.242 --> 35:27.521
Let the lawyer talk for you.

35:35.644 --> 35:36.410
Lieutenant...

35:42.022 --> 35:43.300
tell Lester I'm sorry.

35:58.417 --> 35:59.284
Call the union.

36:00.165 --> 36:01.841
He wants a lawyer
in there with him.

36:08.062 --> 36:10.989
Whenever he's done here, you need
to send someone home with him.

36:11.771 --> 36:13.715
For tonight at least,
he's a suicide watch.

36:17.137 --> 36:17.635
Lieutenant

36:19.357 --> 36:20.166
you'll back him.

36:24.213 --> 36:28.614
What I mean is, if this thing
should turn into some kind of

36:28.615 --> 36:31.243
a black-white thing,
you're his unit commander

36:32.623 --> 36:33.959
he can count on you, right ?

36:45.410 --> 36:46.119
Are you alright ?

36:51.558 --> 36:52.269
Lo mein.

37:01.151 --> 37:02.813
What a clusterfuck.

37:04.190 --> 37:05.709
How many years on for Waggoner ?

37:06.519 --> 37:07.557
Six and a half.

37:08.636 --> 37:11.961
Two commendations, 16th
on the current sergeant's list.

37:12.622 --> 37:15.336
Pretty much the exact opposite
of that goof in there...

37:16.585 --> 37:18.262
you know what's
in that guy's jacket ?

37:19.384 --> 37:22.732
Motherfucker flaked out,
shot up his own radio car.

37:23.516 --> 37:25.417
They were gonna charge
him with false report

37:25.432 --> 37:26.624
until Valchek weighed in...

37:29.693 --> 37:31.838
You know he married
Valchek's daughter, right ?

37:34.887 --> 37:37.059
Fuckin' goof had nine
lives behind that shit...

38:07.181 --> 38:10.617
Eight up, and the rest
still to be activated

38:10.638 --> 38:13.009
whenever the cellular company
gets to our subpoenas.

38:15.027 --> 38:16.673
You did good, detective.

38:19.870 --> 38:21.147
So we're looking for what ?

38:21.659 --> 38:23.089
Looking for one of these phones

38:23.090 --> 38:25.049
to give us signature
on our man, Bodie.

38:25.976 --> 38:28.287
Calls to his girlfriend,
his grandmother...

38:29.366 --> 38:31.057
the numbers we pulled
off the burners.

38:31.587 --> 38:33.346
We see that,
we know it's his phone.

38:34.003 --> 38:37.430
We know it's his phone, we
know he uses it to sell drugs.

38:38.086 --> 38:39.084
We know all that.

38:40.669 --> 38:42.345
We get a tap up and pray like hell

38:42.346 --> 38:44.422
he doesn't throw it
away anytime soon.

38:47.425 --> 38:48.457
Prez would love this...

38:52.562 --> 38:53.793
Ain't gonna lie to y'all.

38:54.203 --> 38:56.561
I don't know about nothing
except the boxing part.

38:57.253 --> 38:58.415
That's all I was thinkin'.

39:00.685 --> 39:01.436
Were you a pug ?

39:02.350 --> 39:03.231
Yeah, I was.

39:03.783 --> 39:05.436
I got sidetracked, though.

39:05.835 --> 39:07.859
Well, reverend Reid
seems to think you'd

39:07.870 --> 39:11.261
be quite a draw for some of
these corner kids that we got.

39:13.396 --> 39:14.792
They didn't think so downtown ?

39:17.099 --> 39:18.166
Well, the fact is

39:19.584 --> 39:22.014
you're looking to put your
gym in the fourth district

39:22.307 --> 39:24.676
so your council person
would be Eunetta Perkins.

39:25.182 --> 39:26.213
Do you know Ms. Perkins ?

39:27.749 --> 39:30.155
Well, few of us do anymore.
Few of us do.

39:32.641 --> 39:35.585
Well, since we can't
really rely on Ms. Perkins,

39:35.616 --> 39:37.460
Ms. Daniels here
will go with you.

39:37.648 --> 39:39.864
She's here because
constituent service

39:39.865 --> 39:41.788
is the life of a city
council person.

39:42.550 --> 39:43.958
She needs to get a taste of that.

39:43.969 --> 39:44.990
At least I hope I do.

39:45.613 --> 39:47.355
If you don't mind me
asking, Mr. Watkins.

39:48.211 --> 39:49.325
Why are you doing this ?

39:49.490 --> 39:51.120
Do you know who reverend Reid is ?

39:52.105 --> 39:53.841
Well, the voters in my district do.

39:58.282 --> 39:59.102
This came today ?

40:02.600 --> 40:03.924
Well, I see, this is fucked up.

40:03.994 --> 40:07.001
I give you a quarter million dollars
to have them tell me my paperwork

40:07.011 --> 40:09.404
is insufficient enough to certify
me as a developer

40:09.405 --> 40:11.029
in the empowerment zone ?
Yeah...

40:11.463 --> 40:12.871
Yeah, you could call it fucked up.

40:13.022 --> 40:14.735
Look, I know we touched
the right people.

40:15.075 --> 40:17.249
Just lemme get with them,
clear this mess right up.

40:17.259 --> 40:17.936
Get with 'em.

40:18.373 --> 40:19.523
Hey, I'm on it, String.

40:19.957 --> 40:21.715
You got the lightbulb
franchise, right ?

40:21.729 --> 40:22.714
That came through...

40:23.089 --> 40:23.453
now...

40:23.476 --> 40:25.270
I'm not talkin' about
30,000 coming back.

40:25.281 --> 40:27.613
I'm talkin' about the quarter
of a mill that you took.

40:27.625 --> 40:30.263
Now, you need to call
Mr. Goose, Mr. Faucet

40:30.497 --> 40:33.113
whoever the fuck you gotta call
because I gave you money to run

40:33.114 --> 40:33.760
remember that ?

40:33.783 --> 40:35.671
It ain't like no
drug deal, String.

40:35.988 --> 40:38.083
Hell, man, you don't put
your money on the street

40:38.105 --> 40:40.346
and have it come right back.
It don't work like that.

40:40.347 --> 40:41.273
Oh, it don't, huh ?

40:41.554 --> 40:42.623
Patience, my man.

40:43.937 --> 40:45.286
Sometimes with the bureaucracy

40:45.907 --> 40:48.179
the one hand don't know
what the other is all about.

40:48.203 --> 40:49.610
Yeah, well, you know what I see ?

40:49.716 --> 40:50.994
I see one hand in my pocket

40:51.418 --> 40:53.775
while the other hand seems
to have grabbed your dick.

40:59.669 --> 41:00.876
Fucking Prez.

41:04.465 --> 41:06.096
I don't even feel like working.

41:08.948 --> 41:09.957
Sanny, baby.

41:09.969 --> 41:11.365
Welcome to the western, guys.

41:12.420 --> 41:13.686
That thing with Pryzbylewski ?

41:14.578 --> 41:15.670
Jesus christ.

41:16.621 --> 41:18.227
So fucking sad, man.

41:19.294 --> 41:20.526
So you humpin' a wagon, huh ?

41:20.831 --> 41:21.664
Fuck yes.

41:22.333 --> 41:23.692
How's that working out for you ?

41:24.104 --> 41:25.617
Jimmy, I love this fucking gig.

41:26.955 --> 41:29.955
Best thing Rawls ever did for me
was to knock me back to a district.

41:30.448 --> 41:31.843
No stress, no struggle.

41:32.056 --> 41:33.135
I work eight-hour shifts.

41:33.276 --> 41:34.519
I take nothing home with me.

41:34.871 --> 41:36.254
Really, I couldn't be happier.

41:36.712 --> 41:38.871
All those years knockin'
my head against  a wall

41:38.894 --> 41:39.962
in homicide and for what ?

41:41.413 --> 41:43.653
The same fuckin' pension
with twice the heartburn.

41:44.063 --> 41:46.068
Well, I'm glad you landed
on your feet, Mike.

41:52.363 --> 41:53.009
Hello.

41:53.055 --> 41:54.112
<i>You called my office.</i>

41:54.803 --> 41:56.104
Yeah, I did, several times.

41:56.292 --> 41:57.008
<i>Really, why ?</i>

41:57.701 --> 41:58.522
Why do you think ?

41:58.991 --> 42:01.301
<i>A sleep over.
You want to get dinner first.</i>

42:01.369 --> 42:02.203
How about tonight ?

42:02.601 --> 42:04.805
<i>Georgia Browns near 15th Street.</i>

42:04.877 --> 42:05.463
That'll work.

42:05.721 --> 42:07.247
You want me to make a reservation ?

42:07.505 --> 42:09.064
<i>No, I can always get a table there.</i>

42:09.089 --> 42:09.946
Alright, whatever.

42:09.970 --> 42:11.142
<i>Let's shoot for 7:30.</i>

42:12.562 --> 42:13.383
I'll see you then.

42:13.981 --> 42:14.733
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

42:17.724 --> 42:18.392
You in ?

42:20.538 --> 42:21.431
What do you think ?

42:22.092 --> 42:23.173
Nice colors.

42:24.394 --> 42:25.273
You got a platform ?

42:25.718 --> 42:26.422
Schools.

42:27.044 --> 42:28.522
Thought I'd be the education mayor.

42:29.179 --> 42:30.269
Well, good luck, Tony.

42:31.514 --> 42:32.248
I mean it.

42:32.472 --> 42:33.270
Thanks, man.

42:34.207 --> 42:35.346
When do you announce ?

42:36.003 --> 42:37.047
Next month, I think.

42:37.538 --> 42:39.783
You know, get out there
early, start raising money.

42:40.624 --> 42:42.885
In fact, I thought I'd make
the rounds of some people

42:42.908 --> 42:43.893
before then, you know ?

42:43.905 --> 42:44.655
Feel them out.

42:44.820 --> 42:45.606
What, Watkins ?

42:45.840 --> 42:46.968
Hey, he seems to like me.

42:47.213 --> 42:48.528
You really think Odell Watkins

42:48.539 --> 42:50.217
is gonna split from
the mayor's camp ?

42:51.419 --> 42:52.826
What you could do is, ah...

42:53.272 --> 42:54.854
feel him out on an issue or two.

42:55.125 --> 42:56.873
You go in that way,
it's more subtle.

42:56.886 --> 42:58.529
You gotta charm the guy first.

42:58.692 --> 43:00.849
Talk to him about the issues
and then down the road

43:00.874 --> 43:03.105
see if he's willing to throw
sunshine on your ass.

43:03.149 --> 43:03.842
I like that.

43:04.687 --> 43:05.461
We should do that.

43:05.906 --> 43:06.364
We ?

43:07.748 --> 43:08.897
I was thinking...

43:09.297 --> 43:11.655
maybe you would ticket
your white ass up with me.

43:12.112 --> 43:13.586
Make a run for Council President.

43:13.650 --> 43:16.031
Me at the top of the ticket,
an emerging black leader

43:16.135 --> 43:18.986
handsome, well-spoken...
you the great white hope

43:19.536 --> 43:21.145
the new voice of civic reform.

43:22.553 --> 43:23.748
We'd give Royce a run, man.

43:24.042 --> 43:26.623
And what makes you think I'm
interested in Council President ?

43:27.009 --> 43:28.440
What the hell else you got going ?

43:31.337 --> 43:31.981
Think about it.

43:48.605 --> 43:50.927
look at 'em. Like roaches
when you turn the lights on.

43:50.938 --> 43:51.876
What's it look like ?

43:52.698 --> 43:53.590
Head and torso.

43:54.153 --> 43:55.469
You got two casings over here.

43:56.745 --> 43:57.427
Hold the call.

43:57.943 --> 44:00.569
So much for the no-violence-
-in-hampsterdam theory, huh ?

44:02.259 --> 44:02.693
Herc...

44:07.481 --> 44:08.468
Help me move the body.

44:09.862 --> 44:10.168
What ?

44:10.438 --> 44:12.409
Just up the block,
just out of the free zone.

44:12.431 --> 44:14.004
Carv, you've lost
your fucking mind.

44:14.027 --> 44:16.447
Before the ambo gets here
to pronounce him, we can do it.

44:16.448 --> 44:16.754
Why ?

44:16.777 --> 44:18.127
Because if homicide gets here...

44:18.466 --> 44:19.793
if they do any kinda canvass...

44:19.801 --> 44:22.534
they're gonna get wind of this
shit on the sixth floor downtown.

44:22.545 --> 44:24.082
- Good.
- Herc, c'mon.

44:24.716 --> 44:25.654
No way, man.

44:26.251 --> 44:26.885
No way.

44:30.721 --> 44:31.718
Fuck those stripes.

44:33.243 --> 44:33.688
Fuck 'em.

44:36.118 --> 44:37.138
Hey Toke, Gil...

44:37.290 --> 44:38.989
help me move this guy
outta Hamsterdam.

44:42.453 --> 44:43.992
I'll be first officer at the scene.

44:44.121 --> 44:45.130
It's my responsibility.

44:50.654 --> 44:52.079
Don't forget the casings.

45:00.846 --> 45:01.960
Make sure that you call me.

45:01.996 --> 45:02.440
I will.

45:02.722 --> 45:03.286
Thank you.

45:03.310 --> 45:04.061
Take care.Bye.

45:32.039 --> 45:33.728
7-60 to kga.

45:34.245 --> 45:35.383
<i>Go ahead, 7-60.</i>

45:35.922 --> 45:38.644
Have 700 10-11 me on
Vincent Street below Fayette.

45:38.984 --> 45:40.555
<i>10-4, Vincent south of Fayette.</i>

45:43.230 --> 45:44.683
You say you worked with this guy ?

45:46.383 --> 45:48.542
Three shots, no warnings.

45:48.636 --> 45:50.383
He scared of black
people or something ?

45:50.478 --> 45:51.253
Shit.

45:54.964 --> 45:56.021
The shit's gone too far.

45:56.161 --> 45:57.276
Yeah, you're tellin' me.

46:05.262 --> 46:08.053
Yeah, I need the number
to the newspaper, "The Sun".

46:11.327 --> 46:13.876
Yeah, the number for the reporters.
The newsroom, yeah...

46:23.202 --> 46:24.948
So, you ain't gonna
say nothing on it ?

46:25.264 --> 46:26.262
What is there to say ?

46:27.517 --> 46:28.736
Avon, this is blood.

46:29.369 --> 46:30.553
- Family.
- I know it.

46:30.729 --> 46:33.475
An' I'm tellin' you that someone
may have done this to us, Avon.

46:33.557 --> 46:34.774
To our family.

46:34.856 --> 46:36.229
The cop's just sayin' that shit.

46:36.403 --> 46:37.401
To mess with your head.

46:37.518 --> 46:38.117
Exactly.

46:38.280 --> 46:38.749
Why ?

46:39.617 --> 46:42.152
That cop don't know me for shit.
What the hell am I to him ?

46:42.176 --> 46:44.181
He knows you're gonna
want to think this thing.

46:44.183 --> 46:46.271
That Dee, you know,
he wouldn't do what he did.

46:46.284 --> 46:47.291
I do think it.

46:54.236 --> 46:55.657
Was it some beef he had ?

46:56.090 --> 46:57.241
Someone on the inside ?

46:57.288 --> 46:59.762
That cop said it was someone
who didn't want you to know

46:59.892 --> 47:01.616
and so they made
it look like it did.

47:02.214 --> 47:03.434
Ain't nobody did nothing.

47:03.469 --> 47:05.264
- But the cop said...
- He's lying.

47:07.551 --> 47:08.549
He paid to lie.

47:24.592 --> 47:25.318
Avon...

47:26.550 --> 47:27.524
you are my brother.

47:29.775 --> 47:31.783
I need to know this
more than anything...

47:35.325 --> 47:36.662
Dee did not roll on us.

47:37.471 --> 47:41.418
He came to the edge, but he
turned around and walked away.

47:42.228 --> 47:45.806
And I know he was willing to do
what he had to for his family.

47:46.110 --> 47:46.990
For us...

47:49.855 --> 47:51.569
but I need to know
that you know that

47:53.011 --> 47:54.454
and you saw him that way.

47:54.689 --> 47:55.088
What...

47:56.707 --> 47:57.809
What you tryin' to say ?

48:01.601 --> 48:02.820
If something happened...

48:03.090 --> 48:04.640
The fuck are you even thinking ?

48:06.036 --> 48:08.891
That I had something to do with it ?
I could do that to my own kin ?

48:11.037 --> 48:12.493
Is that what you fucking think ?

48:13.125 --> 48:14.578
The fuck is in your head ?

48:17.112 --> 48:18.331
I ain't do nothing to Dee.

48:18.941 --> 48:20.385
I ain't have shit to do with it.

48:23.387 --> 48:24.364
To do with what ?

48:27.849 --> 48:28.800
To do with what ?!

48:29.410 --> 48:30.230
Whatever happened.

48:33.961 --> 48:35.819
Whatever it is that
happened, Brianna.

48:56.603 --> 48:58.221
You think I don't
know my business ?

48:58.234 --> 48:59.289
Is that what you think ?

48:59.301 --> 49:01.131
I can get him to you
tomorrow morning.

49:01.742 --> 49:03.278
Just let me see
if I can find him.

49:06.647 --> 49:07.691
I'll make good on this.

49:10.340 --> 49:10.997
What'd he say ?

49:11.316 --> 49:13.440
They found a blood trail
going back up the block.

49:14.906 --> 49:15.868
So maybe...

49:16.044 --> 49:18.049
Smeared, with drag marks.

49:20.420 --> 49:22.682
And they also found a third
casing at the other end.

49:23.057 --> 49:23.549
Shit.

49:26.770 --> 49:27.767
So what's the deal ?

49:28.295 --> 49:30.734
Deal is, we turn this into
a dunker by tomorrow morning

49:30.804 --> 49:33.325
or he starts typing a report
for I.S.D. and the Deputy Ops.

49:33.386 --> 49:34.194
Fuck me.

49:34.335 --> 49:35.250
No, fuck me !

49:43.347 --> 49:45.246
Look, you didn't move
that body, Sergeant.

49:46.537 --> 49:47.430
I moved the body.

49:48.565 --> 49:49.386
Do you understand ?

49:50.829 --> 49:53.011
Look, I respect that you did
what you did on behalf

49:53.023 --> 49:54.512
of what I'm trying to do down here

49:55.626 --> 49:56.998
but the responsibility is mine.

50:00.676 --> 50:01.523
So what do we do ?

50:04.723 --> 50:07.819
He basically said he wasn't
gonna commit any new resources

50:07.984 --> 50:10.092
though he has placed
it on the agenda

50:10.093 --> 50:12.427
of the coordinating council
on criminal justice

50:12.989 --> 50:13.976
for what that's worth...

50:14.045 --> 50:14.948
Poor Clarence.

50:15.312 --> 50:16.332
He's looking tired.

50:17.107 --> 50:19.172
So we're looking for help
from the statehouse.

50:19.689 --> 50:21.823
If the city could
get a couple 100,000

50:21.835 --> 50:24.650
we could afford an overtime
detail to protect these folks.

50:24.826 --> 50:27.442
I know this is an easier sell
with the mayor involved, but...

50:27.453 --> 50:28.498
could you convince him ?

50:28.520 --> 50:29.213
Clarence ?

50:29.683 --> 50:31.233
He barely listens anymore...

50:31.278 --> 50:33.099
Jesus, tell me about it.

50:33.146 --> 50:34.740
I been a councilman
three years now

50:34.741 --> 50:36.617
that's a long fucking
time to be ignored.

50:39.877 --> 50:41.613
I'm sayin' the rules got broke.

50:42.541 --> 50:44.171
My people kept their promises

50:44.570 --> 50:47.455
they did what they said and they
were as good as their word.

50:48.827 --> 50:49.539
Y'all...

50:51.663 --> 50:53.199
y'all ain't keep up
your end of it.

50:53.257 --> 50:54.137
Wasn't my people.

50:54.325 --> 50:56.543
Look, I ain't makin' those
distinctions right now.

50:57.058 --> 50:59.910
Fact is, somebody brought a gun
up in the free zone and used it

51:00.367 --> 51:02.454
and both those things
against the promises made.

51:02.514 --> 51:05.692
Now, I can't justify this shit if
I've got dead bodies up in there.

51:06.515 --> 51:09.178
So what I'm sayin'
is this: come tomorrow

51:09.950 --> 51:11.733
if I don't have a
shooter in bracelets

51:12.659 --> 51:16.672
this whole Hampsterdam
affair is over, it's finished.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.007
I'm gonna take my people
back up on the corners

51:19.019 --> 51:20.777
and we gonna fuck y'all
every way we can.

51:21.082 --> 51:21.952
You hear me ?

51:23.090 --> 51:24.849
Yeah, it was good
while it lasted, huh ?

51:25.389 --> 51:26.761
You had cash on the barrel

51:27.078 --> 51:28.732
and you ain't never
need no bail money.

51:28.755 --> 51:30.856
And hell, I had clean corners
everywhere I looked.

51:30.890 --> 51:32.401
But all that gonna be gone tomorrow

51:33.151 --> 51:34.757
unless y'all bring me my shooter.

51:43.211 --> 51:44.218
You think that'll work ?

51:46.575 --> 51:47.185
Do you ?

51:52.225 --> 51:53.187
That's good food.

51:56.237 --> 51:57.668
How'd you know about this place ?

51:58.161 --> 51:59.545
It was big when Clinton was in.

52:00.108 --> 52:01.328
This and the Red Sage.

52:01.821 --> 52:03.854
Now it's all steakhouses
and cigar bars.

52:05.848 --> 52:08.698
So you live here, but you spend
a lot of time in Baltimore, right ?

52:09.519 --> 52:10.586
I have work up there.

52:11.384 --> 52:13.954
And the alumni stuff
with St. Mary's on the hill.

52:14.243 --> 52:16.848
I went to U.M. law, so I still
have connections there too.

52:17.047 --> 52:18.513
Actually, I grew up in Homeland.

52:18.807 --> 52:19.264
Yeah ?

52:21.846 --> 52:22.970
Lauraville for me.

52:23.909 --> 52:25.117
Where'd you go to college ?

52:25.693 --> 52:26.548
Loyola.

52:27.615 --> 52:28.542
Only one year.

52:29.397 --> 52:31.228
My girlfriend got pregnant so...

52:34.177 --> 52:34.823
so...

52:35.961 --> 52:36.711
so...

52:38.894 --> 52:41.122
so you became
a cop in Baltimore.

52:41.757 --> 52:42.940
How's that working for you ?

52:42.976 --> 52:43.890
Oh, it's pretty good.

52:44.055 --> 52:46.437
I do a lot of high-end drug stuff.

52:46.941 --> 52:47.738
Wiretaps.

52:48.677 --> 52:51.433
Prolonged investigations of violent
offenders, that kinda stuff...

52:53.252 --> 52:55.596
In fact is, there's not a lot
of guys in the department

52:55.629 --> 52:57.822
that can do that kinda thing.
It takes a certain...

52:59.359 --> 53:01.178
I dunno, you gotta love it.

53:06.046 --> 53:07.535
Thrill of the chase an' all that.

53:14.566 --> 53:16.020
So, you do what in politics ?

53:16.711 --> 53:18.260
I do political campaigns.

53:19.821 --> 53:21.311
Like a campaign manager ?

53:22.707 --> 53:24.431
More of a strategist really.

53:25.229 --> 53:26.669
Not so much the day-to-day stuff

53:26.717 --> 53:28.734
but the strategy of how
a candidate can win.

53:30.318 --> 53:32.360
A consultant of sorts.

53:32.406 --> 53:34.353
You strategizing for
anyone in Baltimore ?

53:35.256 --> 53:36.247
I shouldn't say.

53:37.524 --> 53:39.823
I mean, he hasn't officially
announced anything yet.

53:40.363 --> 53:40.926
He any good ?

53:43.787 --> 53:45.911
Hey, if you're for him,
I'll throw the guy a vote.

53:45.936 --> 53:46.545
What the hell.

53:46.568 --> 53:47.858
Who'd you vote for this time ?

53:48.820 --> 53:51.072
What ? You mean Bush
and whatshisname ?

53:51.870 --> 53:52.561
Kerry.

53:54.052 --> 53:55.331
You didn't vote for president ?

53:55.364 --> 53:57.043
I thought about it
yeah, and you know

53:58.484 --> 54:00.432
Bush seemed way
over his head, I know

54:01.101 --> 54:03.013
but he wasn't gonna win
in Maryland anyhow.

54:04.233 --> 54:05.534
And besides, these guys...

54:06.332 --> 54:07.693
it doesn't matter who you got.

54:08.666 --> 54:10.670
None of 'em has a clue
what's really going on.

54:10.695 --> 54:12.336
I mean, where I'm
working every day ?

54:13.191 --> 54:15.760
The only way any of these guys
would even find west Baltimore

54:15.772 --> 54:18.681
is if, I dunno, Air Force One
crash lands into Monroe Street

54:18.694 --> 54:19.949
on it's way back to Andrews.

54:21.696 --> 54:22.870
It just never connects.

54:25.403 --> 54:26.599
Not to what I see, anyway.

54:32.529 --> 54:33.984
Hey, that's just me though.

54:36.965 --> 54:39.626
The man Colvin say
he want the boy locked up

54:40.178 --> 54:42.055
or the free zone
shuts down tomorrow.

54:42.465 --> 54:43.913
All she wrote for Hampsterdam.

54:44.593 --> 54:45.227
Colvin.

54:45.755 --> 54:46.540
From the Western.

54:48.827 --> 54:50.211
Shame, who is this kid, man ?

54:50.763 --> 54:52.440
Some young boy from Tuckie's crew.

54:52.687 --> 54:54.385
He connected ? Kin to anybody ?

54:54.797 --> 54:56.907
Naw, he only been on
for a couple months or so.

54:57.587 --> 54:58.818
What he use the whistle for ?

54:58.842 --> 55:00.649
Some nigger in one a
ghost Kane's crews

55:01.224 --> 55:02.468
laughed at his shoes.

55:08.294 --> 55:08.810
Do it.

55:20.569 --> 55:21.824
I'll be out in a minute...

55:26.791 --> 55:29.724
No, he needs to put those
in departmental mail.

55:31.060 --> 55:31.777
Yeah.

55:33.313 --> 55:34.286
Whaddaya need ?

55:36.136 --> 55:37.427
To turn myself in.

55:38.730 --> 55:39.328
For what ?

55:41.885 --> 55:43.046
I shot a boy.

55:44.900 --> 55:45.744
Oh, yeah ?

55:46.305 --> 55:52.573
