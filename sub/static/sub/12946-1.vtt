WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
: I am not a prophet.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
But sometimes I have prophetic dreams.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Like the one where I was at a garden party.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Excuse me.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Everyone, I have a brief announcement to make.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Jesus was black,
Ronald Reagan was the devil,

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
and the government
is lyin' about 9/11.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Thank you for your time and good night.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
No!

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
That can't be true!

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Unhand me!

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Hi-ya!

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
MAN:
He's on fire!

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Somebody get some water.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Ow!

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Mm-hm. You havin' that dream
where you made

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
the white people riot,
weren't ya?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
But I was tellin' the truth!

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
How many times have I told you,
you better not even  dream

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
about tellin' white folk
the truth?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
You understand me?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Shoot.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Makin' white people riot.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
You better learn
how to lie like me.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm gonna find me a white man
and lie to him right now.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Sorry, Billy Blanks,
but why buy the tape

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
when you can get
the infomercial for free?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Whew!

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
What the hell?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Boys!

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Would one of y'all like
to explain this?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Uh...

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
You mean, the orange juice
or the miniskirt?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Which one of y'all drank
the last glass of orange juice?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
That's the last full day's
supply of vitamin C.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
What am I supposed to do
about my vitamin C now?

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Y'all need to start
appreciatin' your granddaddy.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
I went and spent
your inheritance

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
on this beautiful house
in this neighborhood.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
And all I ask you to do

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
is act like you got some class.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Hey, what's class?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
It means don't act
like niggas.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
S-see? That's what
I'm talkin' about right there.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
We don't use the N-word
in this house.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Granddad, you said the word
"nigga" 46 times yesterday.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I counted.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Nigga, hush.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Now, you may not like it,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
but I moved y'all out here

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
to expand your horizon.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
There's a  new  white man
out here.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
He's refined.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
For example, did you know

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
that the new white man
loves gourmet cheese?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Wait.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I'm sorry,
did you say cheese?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Yep, cheese.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
You give the meanest white man
a piece of cheese,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
and he turn into Mr. Rogers.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Granddad,
that doesn't make sense.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Don't you talk back to me.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Granddad, you can't tame

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
the white supremacist
power structure with cheese!

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Oh, yes, I can!
No, you can't!

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
GRANDDAD: Yes, I can!
No, you can not!

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
HUEY:
Cheese.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
How can somebody that old

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
say somethin' that stupid?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
RILEY:
I know about white people too.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Like, when they talk,

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
they say the whole word,

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
like this.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
HUEY:
Why'd he even move us

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
out here?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Probably did it
just to make us miserable.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
RILEY:
And white people take time out

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
to study.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I hate this place.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
RILEY: And  white people arrest you.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Man.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
RILEY:
Hey!

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Looks like the feds.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Who the hell could be
knockin' on this door

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
this early in the mornin'?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
If it's a Jehovah Witness,
I'm kickin' his ass.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Yes?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I'm looking for Robert Freeman.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I'm Robert Freeman.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
I'm Ed Wuncler.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
From Wuncler's
Savings and Loan.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Uh, so?

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
I own the bank
that owns your house.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Oh, well--

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Come in, sir.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Welcome to your house.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
Robert, my family founded
Woodcrest over 170 years ago.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
I was born here,
and I still live here.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
I consider this place
to be family,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
and I'm very selective

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
about who I allow
in to that family.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
You understand
what I'm saying, Robert?

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Hey, yes,
I totally understand.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Would you like some...

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
cheese?

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Did you just offer me cheese?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Yes, I did.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I'd love some cheese, thank you.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Hm.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Riley!

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Go get the fancy cheese.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
I'd like to ask some questions,
if you don't mind.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Are you gay, and if so,
do you have a gay lover

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
living with you
in the house?

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Gay? No, I'm not gay.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I mean, I happen to think
a man looks nice

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
with good hair and a ponytail.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
But, no, mm-mm, I'm not gay.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
What's your position
on gay marriage?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Well, first of all,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I believe all marriage
is wrong.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Good one, good.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Uh, you don't look
like you associate

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
with any Muslims,
Arabs, you know.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
People of terrorist descent?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Uh, well...

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
RILEY:
We got Kraft,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
and we got Velveeta.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Your grandson?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Afraid so. Ahem.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
You know, I have a grandson too.
He's--

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Is that right?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Well, heh-heh-heh,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
this has been delightful.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Well, it's really been
a pleasure, Mr., uh--

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
I-Own-Everything.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
We should get together soon

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
and have, uh...
more cheese.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Like a nice Brie
or a G-Gouda--

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
G-Gayda-- Gouda.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Heh. You know, you're
my kind of guy, Freeman.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Old school.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
What are you doin' tomorrow?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
We're throwin' a garden party

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
for my grandson.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
He just got back from Iraq.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
You should stop by,
meet some of the neighbors.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Bring the kids.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Sounds like a splendid idea.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I'll see you tomorrow.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Uh, thanks for stoppin' by.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Cheers.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Huey!

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
GRANDDAD:
This damn thing looks real.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Can I have my gun back?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Son of a--!

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
GRANDDAD:
A garden party?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah, boy.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I might buy sandals
and new underwear.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Oh, you shot me!

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Granddad tried
to assassinate me.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Boy, what did I tell ya?
This is the new white man.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
He's distinguished.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Granddad, I do not sip tea
with the enemy.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
You could force me to go,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
but you cannot force me
to be someone I'm not.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
The hell I can't!

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
You gonna go and you're
not gonna embarrass me

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
in front of my new neighbors,
or I'm gonna beat your ass.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Why can't we be ourselves, huh?
Why can't I be me?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Are you ashamed of us?
Very.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
We never asked
to move here

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
with your precious
new white people, Granddad.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Didn't ask?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Well, you didn't ask for us

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
to be attacked
by dogs and fire hoses,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
so you can live here,
but we did it anyway.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Oh, here he go again with
the dogs and the fire hoses.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Shoot, we  were  attacked
by dogs and fire hoses.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Were you attacked?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
I-I don't know what difference
that makes.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Because it's like
the whole generation

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
tries to take credit for
what happened to some people.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
That's ridiculous.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Now, see--
Well, you know--

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Uh, what had happened was...

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
MAN:
Get out of here.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Go, go, go!

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
MAN:
Come on, get out of here.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Aw, man.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I missed it.
Was it bad?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Did they do the thing
with the fire hoses?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
What do you think, chump?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Damn, what's eatin' you?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
A goddamn German shepherd,
that's what.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Where was you?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I-I had to go back
to the apartment

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
'cause I forgot
my raincoat.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
You went to--? You--?

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
This nigga went to get
a motherfuckin' raincoat.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
I can't believe you.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
We all been watchin'
the same news.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
The police been doin'
this fire hose thing all week.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I just assumed
we'd all wear our raincoat.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Damn it, Robert.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Who the hell comes
to a march with a raincoat?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Bet you wish
you had a coat now.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
You son of a bitch!

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
GRANDDAD:
Remember what Dr. King said!

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Who actually got hit with
the fire hose ain't important.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Now, we goin' to this party,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
and your black asses
are gonna behave.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
If I'm lucky, I'll find myself
a nice white woman

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
with a flat booty
who'll listen to my problems.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
GRANDDAD:
Now, the word for the day

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
is "behave."

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
H-E-A-V-E.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Behave.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Excuse me. Out of the way,
Kunta Kinte! Yes, sir.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
How can I help ya?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
GRANDDAD:
Excuse me?

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Oh, Lord have mercy.
Security. Security.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
We got a Code Black.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Code Black at the main gate.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
:  ■ Ruckus, what the hell

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
is a Code Black?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
There are some hungry-lookin'

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
niggas at the front gate.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
What y'all doin' here?

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Deliveries are in the back.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Well, my name is Robert Freeman,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I was invited here
by Ed Wuncler.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
Well, I'm Ruckus.
Uncle Ruckus, no relation.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
And I work for Mr. Wuncler.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
And you slick niggas

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000

into this here party.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Ruckus, what the hell
are you doing?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Uh, Mr. Freeman,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I'm sorry.
Please, come this way.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
GRANDDAD:
See, boys?

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And you thought we'd be
the only black people.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
WUNCLER:
Robert!

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Glad you made it, Robert.
This is my grandson, Ed III.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
How are you?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Whassup y'all, what's good?

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Uh...so I understand
you just got back from Iraq.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
For real?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Yo, what's it like?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
What's it like?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
What I supposed
to say to that?

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
It was cool, there was bitches?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Okay, there was bitches,
but a lot of them had,

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
you know, they was covered up

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
in them curtains and stuff
they be wearin'.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
But I digress.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
It was war!

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
It was war, basically.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
War, you know what that's like?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Motherfuckers be,
like, shootin':

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Bombs blowin' up.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
And, you know,
the shit scared me.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
It scared the shit out of me.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Matter of fact, I shit on myself
over a dozen times

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
and ran out of toilet paper
after the second time.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
So you know
what that meant, right?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I had to use the thumb, man.
It was kind of nasty.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
But, you know,
the good thing about it

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
was they stopped taking me
out on patrol.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
'Cause my name
became "Stink Bomb."

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
You know what I'm sayin'?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
They said, you know,
I was giving away our position

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
because of the shit smell.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
That was fine with me,
you know what I'm sayin'.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
They-- They wanted
to leave me back.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And I was like:
"Well, fuck y'all.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
"Y'all go ahead on 'cause
I don't need y'all anyway.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I'm rich, bitch."

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
The fuck y'all looking at?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Hey, li'l man.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Like guns?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Yeah!

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
C'mon.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Come on, let's get that drink.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
MAN:
Well, you should definitely see

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
The Passion.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
It's a very important movie.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Couldn't see it.
White Jesus.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Excuse me?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Come on, man.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
It's supposed to be
all historically accurate,

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
and they still have
a white man

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
playin' Jesus?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
That's some old bullshit.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Young man,
you speak so well.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
RUCKUS:
Well,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
la-di-da-di-do.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Look like we got us
the winner

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
of the Lucky-Nigga-of-the-Year
award.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Ah.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
They must think
the sun shine out your ass.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Mr. Wuncler's
been very nice, yes.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
They must think you
Sidney fucking Poitier.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Well,

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
I been workin'
for Mr. Wuncler for 20 years.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
I ain't never got invited
to the party.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
Shoot, he don't even let me
use the front door.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
But you wouldn't know
about that,

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
now, would ya, Mr. Tibbs?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Oh, yeah.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
They must think
your shit smell

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
like spring daisies
and cinnamon.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Check this out.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Wow.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Are those real?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Real?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Put it this way:

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
if I pick one up
and put it to your face,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
pull the trigger,
will you be dead?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
HUEY:
And all I'm saying is,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Ronald Reagan was the devil.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
You are such
an articulate young man.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I'm tryin' to explain to you

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
that Ronald Reagan was
the devil.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Ronald Wilson Reagan.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Each of his names
has six letters.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Six-six-six.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Man, doesn't
that offend you?

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
I love this kid.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Stop that.
What are you doin'?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Stop clappin'.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Having a good time, Robert?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
I-It's, uh...

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Come on,
have a drink with me.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
You look nervous.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
Do I make you nervous,
Free-man?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Nervous? No.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
I was just, uh, keepin' an eye
out for the boys.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
This is a lovely party.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
The only joy
I get from these parties

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
is standing around,
telling mean-spirited jokes

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
at other people's expense.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
I do that too.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Check out that guy.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
Why is his face
all twisted up like that?

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Looks like he jacks off
with Icy Hot.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
He looks like
he just shit a gerbil.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
A gerbil.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Sorry, I'll be right back.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
HUEY:
Tell me this,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
why was all the video recordin'

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
of the Pentagon attack
seized by the FBI

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
and never seen again?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
He speaks so well.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
He's adorable.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Are you even listenin'

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
to what I'm sayin'?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Nigga, if you ruin
this party for me,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I'll put my--
Ruin the party? They love me.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
These people aren't worried
about us.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
They're not worried
about anything. They're rich.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
No matter what happens,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
these people will
just keep applaudin'.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
: Ahem. Attention please.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
My name is Uncle Ruckus, no relation.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
I want to sing y'all a brand
new song I just wrote called:

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
"Don't Trust Them New Niggas
Over There."

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Sing along
if you know the words.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
Over there

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
In the air

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Nappy-head niggas

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Over there

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
Are you sure that vest'll stop
this shotgun?

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
Man, I'm like the Terminator
in this vest.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
RUCKUS:

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
What? You don't believe me?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Go ahead!

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Pull the trigger.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Now, are you sure that--?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I said pull that trigger now!

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
You wanna play rough?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Okay.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
Over yonder

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
It'll make you wonder

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Nigga-figures

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
I think the N-word is okay,
as long as they say it.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
See?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Say hello to my little friend.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Fuck y'all lookin' at?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Hey, you think we in trouble?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
You shot his grandson
out the window.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
What you think?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
I don't know.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
I didn't want to move here,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
but I don't really want Granddad
to lose his house.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
He worked his whole life
to get here.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
Man, I like that house.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Oh, well,
I shot a nigga!

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Mr. Wuncler,

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
I'm...sorry about
the whole, you know,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
my grandson shooting
your grandson

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
out of the window thing.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Are you mad?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
In 30 years,

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
that boy will be the president
of the United States.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
And he'll still
be a fucking idiot.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Whew.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Now, are we gonna have
that drink or what?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Glad you were able
to make it, Robert.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
To the old school.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
To the old school.
