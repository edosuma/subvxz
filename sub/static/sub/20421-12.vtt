00:02.680 --> 00:05.370
<i>Dungeons are places such 
as abandoned structures,</i>

00:05.370 --> 00:07.570
<i>fortresses, shrines, or caves.</i>

00:07.570 --> 00:11.110
<i>Closed-off areas where battles 
with monsters occur.</i>

00:12.390 --> 00:15.230
<i>Many dungeons are home 
to low-level monsters,</i>

00:15.620 --> 00:20.450
<i>while more powerful monsters, like dragons, 
will sometimes guard treasures there.</i>

00:21.200 --> 00:23.920
<i>And since you have to work in a limited area,</i>

00:23.920 --> 00:26.300
<i>fighting them is more difficult than in the field.</i>

00:27.100 --> 00:30.570
<i>Thus, defeating them requires complex teamwork.</i>

02:08.070 --> 02:09.450
I know this song...

02:13.300 --> 02:16.230
<i>It's the opening theme from 
when </i>Elder Tale<i> was a game.</i>

02:18.370 --> 02:20.720
Once girls reach a certain age,

02:20.720 --> 02:23.120
they make their social debut at a ball.

02:23.870 --> 02:26.510
The ten-day conference that starts tomorrow

02:26.510 --> 02:29.050
is also a chance for us to get acquainted.

02:30.270 --> 02:36.130
<b>The Forest of Lagranda</b>

02:32.430 --> 02:34.030
The Forest of Lagranda.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.200
Go and join the dance.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.390
Just look...

02:46.630 --> 02:49.110
Everyone is quite interested in you.

02:49.730 --> 02:50.550
How about it?

02:52.890 --> 02:53.980
What about you, miss?

02:54.650 --> 02:56.530
I am my lord's ninja...

02:56.530 --> 02:58.860
I mustn't be seen in such a public setting.

03:02.020 --> 03:03.310
Then what about you?

03:04.150 --> 03:05.360
No, no...

03:05.360 --> 03:07.010
I'm better suited for other things.

03:07.380 --> 03:09.330
That's right... The obvious choice is...

03:09.330 --> 03:11.120
...Shiroe, right?

03:12.320 --> 03:14.980
As the Round Table's representative,

03:14.980 --> 03:18.140
I'd like to speak with Lord Sergiatte a bit more.

03:18.140 --> 03:19.340
Crusty...

03:21.810 --> 03:24.100
<i>He's doing this deliberately.</i>

03:25.380 --> 03:27.590
<i>I suppose I'll go embarrass myself...</i>

03:31.270 --> 03:32.440
Shiroe...

03:33.570 --> 03:36.740
A gentleman must never show 
his lack of confidence.

03:37.120 --> 03:40.700
Right now, you're a member of 
the Round Table's delegation.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.370
You're right. I'm sorry.

03:43.820 --> 03:44.740
Okay...

03:44.740 --> 03:48.800
Then, since you're being a good boy, 
I'll give you a magic present!

03:55.230 --> 03:57.130
H-Henrietta...

03:57.580 --> 03:59.540
Shiroe, smile.

03:59.850 --> 04:01.650
Thrust out your chest.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.390
Put your hand on my hip.

04:10.830 --> 04:14.520
Just so you know, I can't dance at all.

04:14.830 --> 04:18.270
You know what my class is, don't you?

04:18.270 --> 04:19.210
Class?

04:20.540 --> 04:21.280
That's right.

04:21.280 --> 04:23.530
I am a bard.

04:23.940 --> 04:24.700
Now, then...

04:25.200 --> 04:26.530
Let's dance.

04:43.010 --> 04:46.080
So you are a bard, Miss Isuzu?

04:46.430 --> 04:47.850
<b>Isuzu 
Race/ Human 
Bard, Lv. 24 
Crescent Moon Alliance</b>

04:48.230 --> 04:50.310
What an elegant sound...

04:50.770 --> 04:53.380
It perfectly suits this clear night air!

04:53.380 --> 04:55.000
You're exaggerating...

04:55.700 --> 04:58.240
Um, what's a bard?

04:58.240 --> 05:00.480
One of the weapon-based offensive classes.

05:01.200 --> 05:06.590
But unlike the assassin or swashbuckler, 
they play a support role.

05:06.590 --> 05:10.000
Support? Like an enchanter?

05:10.490 --> 05:11.370
Um...

05:12.050 --> 05:17.020
They specialize in lowering enemy stats 
or enhancing their allies' abilities.

05:17.310 --> 05:18.440
Or so I've heard.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.510
That's a very bland explanation.

05:22.670 --> 05:26.400
The difference between bards and 
enchanters is that they use music.

05:26.400 --> 05:30.890
One trait that distinguishes them is the 
long duration of many of their abilities.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.020
Think you've got it, Shiroe?

05:34.340 --> 05:35.330
Mostly...

05:36.230 --> 05:39.130
<i>Basically, it's like any other rhythm game.</i>

05:40.000 --> 05:41.350
Right step.

05:41.350 --> 05:42.660
Right forward.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.360
Half turn!

05:45.630 --> 05:46.910
That's it.

05:46.910 --> 05:47.910
Got it, teacher.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.840
Oh, my.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.280
<i>Music, huh?</i>

05:56.000 --> 05:57.650
<i>I'd forgotten about it.</i>

06:07.090 --> 06:08.260
Hey, waitâ€”

06:09.400 --> 06:10.480
Ow...

06:10.480 --> 06:11.600
Are you hurt?

06:11.800 --> 06:13.170
I'm fine.

06:13.170 --> 06:15.570
Huh? Where are you from?

06:16.480 --> 06:18.100
Play with us!

06:18.100 --> 06:20.690
It's boring hanging around the grown-ups, right?

06:20.690 --> 06:22.290
We're playing hide-and-seek.

06:22.290 --> 06:23.360
Hurry! Hurry!

06:27.760 --> 06:28.710
She disappeared!

06:28.710 --> 06:29.640
Wow!

06:29.640 --> 06:31.740
She's a genius at hide-and-seek!

06:35.020 --> 06:36.220
I'm exhausted.

06:37.870 --> 06:38.500
Yes?

06:38.880 --> 06:40.110
Shiroe?

06:40.110 --> 06:41.560
Can you talk right now?

06:41.560 --> 06:42.820
Oh, Minori...

06:42.820 --> 06:43.630
What's up?

06:44.070 --> 06:48.360
Tomorrow, we're going to a dungeon.

06:50.840 --> 06:51.510
Worried?

06:55.420 --> 06:59.520
It's true that at your current level, 
it may be a bit rough...

07:00.680 --> 07:04.430
I'm worried I'll slow everyone down.

07:04.820 --> 07:06.740
Naotsugu and the other 
trainers won't be there...

07:07.730 --> 07:09.120
Listen to me, Minori...

07:09.520 --> 07:10.890
You aren't alone.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.660
And there's more to a battle than your level.

07:15.580 --> 07:18.190
Do you remember the basics of 
party combat that I taught you?

07:18.190 --> 07:20.420
Oh, yes... Just a second...

07:22.060 --> 07:27.010
Formation, operator, field monitor... 
And patrol file, right?

07:27.010 --> 07:28.760
If you remember that, you'll be all right.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.800
You can do it.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.040
Yeah!

07:34.510 --> 07:37.230
<i>I know I should understand...</i>

07:38.260 --> 07:41.310
Unfortunately, it's something she 
has to figure out for herself.

07:42.610 --> 07:43.510
Good luck.

07:48.550 --> 07:49.560
This is good!

07:49.560 --> 07:50.820
This is so good!

07:51.400 --> 07:53.940
The nobility eats pretty well.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.080
So, the cooking method has spread

07:56.080 --> 07:58.030
among the People of the Land...

08:00.100 --> 08:04.450
Doesn't that mean we're affecting this world?

08:04.450 --> 08:05.210
Yes.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.910
And for us to avoid being 
a destructive influence,

08:08.910 --> 08:11.930
we need to know more about this world.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.220
Exactly.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.710
I think I understand what you've been saying.

08:19.450 --> 08:20.730
By the way, Shiroe,

08:21.210 --> 08:23.180
did you sleep well last night?

08:23.180 --> 08:25.900
You had quite a workout!

08:25.900 --> 08:27.980
Yes, thank you.

08:29.070 --> 08:30.960
One day, I'll get even with you.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.880
I didn't know you were the type 
to hold a grudge, my lord.

08:34.730 --> 08:36.240
How petty.

08:37.490 --> 08:38.960
What about you, Akatsuki?

08:38.960 --> 08:40.540
You seem a little grouchy today.

08:41.260 --> 08:42.710
Not at all.

08:42.710 --> 08:43.540
You are.

08:43.540 --> 08:44.170
Am not.

08:44.170 --> 08:45.170
Are, too!

08:45.170 --> 08:46.000
My lord!

08:46.080 --> 08:47.000
<b>Pear Jam 
Maihama</b>

08:47.190 --> 08:47.980
The jam.

08:49.090 --> 08:50.180
Pass me the jam.

08:50.650 --> 08:52.670
Oh, right... Right, right.

09:03.480 --> 09:05.150
By the way, Michitaka...

09:05.590 --> 09:08.130
Did we bring any cooks with us?

09:08.510 --> 09:10.190
Hmm? A few...

09:10.620 --> 09:12.610
We should call in the support squad.

09:13.270 --> 09:14.230
Indeed.

09:14.230 --> 09:15.360
What do you mean?

09:15.820 --> 09:20.370
From the size of this terrace, 
I believe they're expecting guests.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.600
Guests?

09:23.870 --> 09:24.870
Nobles?

09:25.400 --> 09:27.400
The conference lasts for ten days.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.310
But it isn't held every day.

09:30.680 --> 09:34.070
The majority is backroom deals 
and private meetings.

09:34.070 --> 09:35.970
Like a tea party, you might say.

09:36.540 --> 09:39.640
The politics here are more complicated 
than I'd expected...

09:39.950 --> 09:43.830
Within Eastal's League of Freedom Cities, 
there are twenty-four noble families.

09:44.330 --> 09:47.150
Add in the Round Table, and it's twenty-five.

09:47.790 --> 09:52.280
Lord Sergiatte's city, Maihama, has a 
population of thirty thousand or so.

09:53.400 --> 09:58.810
That puts Akihabara's strength, with its 
twenty thousand, into perspective.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.410
I have a good idea as to what the nobles seek.

10:02.410 --> 10:03.570
Their first goal

10:03.570 --> 10:08.230
was to learn the scope of Akihabara 
and the Round Table's ambitions.

10:08.700 --> 10:12.930
But last night, at the ball, it's likely that 
we dispelled some of those concerns.

10:13.500 --> 10:17.280
So, next, they'll try to win us to their side...

10:17.280 --> 10:18.010
Yes.

10:18.480 --> 10:19.850
Since the Apocalypse,

10:19.850 --> 10:22.720
we haven't received any quests from 
the People of the Land, after all.

10:24.150 --> 10:27.140
The May incident caused all this.

10:27.540 --> 10:30.730
Supposedly, the adventurers 
call it the Apocalypse.

10:31.500 --> 10:35.790
Until now, Akihabara adventurers 
were merely a disorganized mob.

10:35.790 --> 10:38.240
That made them easy to deal with individually.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.240
That's true.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.930
Exterminating monsters, guarding caravans...

10:42.930 --> 10:46.100
As long as we paid them, 
they were willing to do anything.

10:46.460 --> 10:51.380
But since then, they've stopped coming 
to our territory almost entirely.

10:51.380 --> 10:53.750
And now, they've founded that Round Table,

10:53.750 --> 10:56.670
trying to rule their city just like we do!

10:57.850 --> 11:00.950
I've heard their technology 
advances by the moment.

11:00.950 --> 11:03.600
We must get them on our side, and fast!

11:04.200 --> 11:07.680
If we screw this up, we could 
find ourselves left behind!

11:08.720 --> 11:11.190
They need our power.

11:11.650 --> 11:14.480
But they'll never act like our inferiors.

11:15.030 --> 11:19.070
Most likely, they'll grant a noble title 
to Crusty or the Round Table.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.070
Always trying to put us in their debt...

11:22.590 --> 11:25.200
The problem is how to deal with them 
when they come to us individually,

11:25.200 --> 11:27.450
rather than through the Round Table.

11:27.950 --> 11:28.960
It's a difficult problem.

11:29.950 --> 11:34.710
Most likely, some nobles will try to speak 
to individuals or to guilds in the future.

11:35.300 --> 11:38.590
But both the combat and craft 
guilds are likely to want

11:38.590 --> 11:40.860
to take them up on their offers.

11:41.250 --> 11:42.090
As will individuals.

11:42.790 --> 11:47.230
It's impossible for the Round 
Table to monitor everyone,

11:47.230 --> 11:48.600
nor is it our purpose.

11:49.220 --> 11:52.890
But we'll have to establish rules of some sort.

11:52.890 --> 11:56.070
And that's one reason it's so important 
for us to know what they're thinking.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.500
And so, Akatsuki...

11:58.900 --> 11:59.490
Your turn.

12:00.160 --> 12:01.080
Go and recon.

12:01.900 --> 12:02.740
Understood.

12:09.180 --> 12:12.700
That is the Forest of Lagranda.

12:19.510 --> 12:22.840
It's fairly large inside, but basically,

12:22.840 --> 12:26.470
at the first branch, the right side 
leads to the beginner course.

12:26.900 --> 12:29.350
The left is for intermediate players.

12:29.350 --> 12:30.980
<b>Lagranda Forest 
Walkthrough</b>

12:31.190 --> 12:33.150
Don't push yourselves too hard.

12:33.150 --> 12:37.250
It's important to know your own limits.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.610
That's right, don't get yourselves killed.

12:39.790 --> 12:42.410
You'll all be camping in the clearing here,

12:42.410 --> 12:44.410
entering the dungeon each day.

12:44.860 --> 12:47.140
After you return, I'm in charge of your support.

12:48.030 --> 12:51.420
All right, time to split into groups.

12:51.730 --> 12:54.320
After that, each group will 
hold a strategy meeting,

12:54.320 --> 12:55.880
then enter the dungeon.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.020
Okay!

12:57.980 --> 13:00.880
Right, let's start by introducing ourselves.

13:01.130 --> 13:07.430

13:11.480 --> 13:13.380
I'm level 25.

13:13.380 --> 13:17.270
While I'm not good at attacking, 
leave the healing to me!

13:20.170 --> 13:22.440
I'll be taking part in attacks, too.

13:22.440 --> 13:23.940

My class is shrine priest.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.920
Don't slow me down!

13:45.970 --> 13:46.930
Who are you?

13:48.510 --> 13:51.110
My name is Rundel Haus Code.

13:51.490 --> 13:53.810
You can call me Rudy!

13:54.080 --> 13:55.060
What's your class?

13:55.360 --> 13:57.660
Can't you tell by looking?

13:58.400 --> 13:59.560
I'm a sorcerer.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.550
You sure talk a lot.

14:01.550 --> 14:02.320
What's your level?

14:04.190 --> 14:08.160
<b>Rundel Haus Code 
Race/ Human 
Sorcerer, Lv. 23</b>

14:04.400 --> 14:05.860
23... Why?

14:05.860 --> 14:07.830
That's hardly different from Minori's!

14:08.220 --> 14:09.570
Do not fear.

14:09.980 --> 14:13.320
My elegant and devastating techniques 
will annihilate the enemy.

14:13.690 --> 14:15.800
You can simply stand behind 
me and provide support.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.180
Your class doesn't fight in front!

14:18.180 --> 14:20.210
Don't worry over the details.

14:22.350 --> 14:26.470
Um, why don't we hold our strategy meeting?

14:26.850 --> 14:29.160
What are we supposed to talk about?

14:29.160 --> 14:31.140
Yeah, I have no idea...

14:31.640 --> 14:35.020
Um, let's start with our basic formation...

14:35.020 --> 14:36.280
It isn't hard, guys.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.480
Just get yourselves fired up!

14:41.180 --> 14:42.110
Um...

14:43.110 --> 14:45.150
Yeah! That must be it!

14:45.150 --> 14:47.480
We're about to go fighting!

14:47.840 --> 14:48.490
Well...

14:49.010 --> 14:50.540
It's a dungeon, a dungeon!

14:50.540 --> 14:51.890
We should be fired up!

14:51.890 --> 14:52.980
That's right...

14:52.980 --> 14:54.740
Although we must also be elegant and noble.

14:55.970 --> 14:59.260
But a man must be fired up and hot blooded!

14:59.260 --> 15:01.690
You really do get it!

15:05.090 --> 15:07.630
<i>I can't get a word in...</i>

15:12.360 --> 15:14.140
Okay, let's go.

15:14.560 --> 15:17.630
Tohya, do you remember 
what you promised me?

15:18.020 --> 15:18.890
Master...

15:19.830 --> 15:23.870
The job of a front-line tank is 
to absorb all the enemy hits,

15:23.870 --> 15:26.030
and to trust his companions.

15:26.680 --> 15:27.590
Tohya,

15:27.590 --> 15:29.670
as a man, you must promise to do that!

15:30.620 --> 15:32.240
Of course I remember.

15:32.490 --> 15:34.020
Okay, then!

15:36.480 --> 15:38.970
What's wrong with Minori?

15:39.270 --> 15:41.750
O-Oh, it's nothing...

15:42.160 --> 15:45.630
Listen, if you ever have a problem, step forward!

15:46.080 --> 15:48.300
With your heart, not your legs.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.650
My heart?

15:51.410 --> 15:52.300
Right!

16:07.630 --> 16:08.530
What? What?

16:08.800 --> 16:09.650
An enemy attack?!

16:09.950 --> 16:12.960
Calm down! We need some light first!

16:12.960 --> 16:14.910
Understood. I'll handle this.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.920
I hope the enemy won't 
see it and come for us...

16:18.920 --> 16:21.290
That's exactly what I hope they'll do.

16:21.610 --> 16:22.820
What?

16:23.200 --> 16:26.410
Most of the enemies here are undead.

16:26.410 --> 16:27.580
I get it!

16:27.580 --> 16:30.770
The undead can locate us, even in the dark.

16:31.300 --> 16:33.680
So the darkness acts to their advantage.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.010
<i>Fox Light!</i>

16:37.510 --> 16:39.180
Mine is brighter!

16:39.180 --> 16:39.900
See?

16:39.900 --> 16:41.730
That isn't the issue!

16:42.270 --> 16:46.220
In battle, you're supposed 
to have multiple lights.

16:47.060 --> 16:50.240
Oh... Then it isn't that my light is weak.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.050
Of course it isn't, since I'm awesome!

17:02.270 --> 17:03.590
B-Bones...

17:03.590 --> 17:07.740
It looks like one of the groups that went 
before us fought skeletons here.

17:10.170 --> 17:11.460
The path splits!

17:11.460 --> 17:15.760
Wasn't the right for beginners, 
and the left for intermediates?

17:16.770 --> 17:19.180
Seems the ones before us went left.

17:20.580 --> 17:22.980
For today, we'll go this way. C'mon.

17:22.980 --> 17:24.020
Sure.

17:24.020 --> 17:27.150
But don't assume I'll always be turning right.

17:31.340 --> 17:33.400
Um, Rundel Haus...

17:33.770 --> 17:36.480
You can cast your magic from the back row.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.730
What are you talking about, Miss Minori?

17:39.200 --> 17:41.160
The battle begins the moment 
the enemy's in sight.

17:41.910 --> 17:46.920
I need to minimize the lag between seeing 
the enemy and using my magic.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.490
<i>If he gets into trouble, I'll help out.</i>

17:53.490 --> 17:57.750
<i>I can't heal as well as Serara, 
though we're both healers,</i>

17:57.750 --> 18:01.720
<i>but my magic can cancel a certain 
amount of enemy damage.</i>

18:03.820 --> 18:07.690
<i>The samurai's strength is its powerful attacks, 
but they have a long cool down...</i>

18:08.140 --> 18:10.360
<i>Knowing when to attack is hard.</i>

18:11.080 --> 18:11.890
Stop.

18:17.570 --> 18:18.820
<b>Skeleton                   Skeleton                   Skeleton
Rank/ Normal         Rank/ Normal         Rank/ Normal</b>

18:19.250 --> 18:20.590
There are three.

18:20.590 --> 18:22.550
Okay, I'll go first.

18:27.350 --> 18:28.040
Tohya!

18:28.310 --> 18:30.670
Don't just charge straight ahead!

18:30.840 --> 18:31.920
I know!

18:33.390 --> 18:34.510
<i>Iizuna Slash!</i>

18:36.780 --> 18:39.500
The samurai also has ranged attacks!

18:40.140 --> 18:41.850
Now, come and get me!

18:42.920 --> 18:43.810
I see.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.560
He was drawing the enemy's attention.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.660
<i>Whirlwind Slash!</i>

18:52.310 --> 18:52.940
How's that?

18:54.150 --> 18:55.440
<b>Tohya 
Race/ Human 
Samurai, Lv. 29 
Log Horizon</b>

18:56.570 --> 18:58.200
<i>Purification Barrier!</i>

18:59.120 --> 19:00.070
Oh, no...

19:00.070 --> 19:03.200
I need to use my magic first, or it won't work!

19:03.500 --> 19:05.950
<i>Heartbeat Healing!</i>

19:06.880 --> 19:10.250
Tohya, ten seconds until you're 
back to full health.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.110
Not bad, Mister Tohya.

19:12.530 --> 19:14.380
Now it's my turn!

19:15.120 --> 19:16.800
<i>Orb of Lava!</i>

19:25.150 --> 19:26.060
Wow.

19:26.590 --> 19:28.940
It's a ranged attack, but it's so powerful!

19:29.910 --> 19:33.770
This is the power of the sorcerer, 
the magical attack class?

19:41.990 --> 19:44.470
I did it! It worked!

19:44.470 --> 19:46.640
Isuzu, what did you do?

19:46.640 --> 19:49.330
I set up a support song in advance.

19:49.860 --> 19:51.450
<i>Round Carol...</i>

19:51.450 --> 19:55.350
If a party member attacks with magic, 
it automatically follows up with another attack.

19:55.950 --> 19:58.380
That's amazing, Miss Isuzu!

19:58.380 --> 20:03.390
My artfully destructive spells have 
reached the level of legend!

20:03.870 --> 20:05.780
Grazie!

20:05.780 --> 20:06.510
Nice play.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.470
Rundel Haus...

20:11.470 --> 20:12.160
Behind you!

20:12.600 --> 20:14.320
What's wrong, Miss Minori?

20:14.670 --> 20:17.610
Have you fallen in love with my beautiful magic?

20:15.820 --> 20:16.980
They're targeting you...

20:23.540 --> 20:25.230
Wh-What's happening?!

20:26.030 --> 20:27.450
<b>Skeleton Archer
Rank/ Normal</b>

20:27.610 --> 20:29.080
There's another one?

20:29.710 --> 20:30.480
Stop!

20:30.480 --> 20:32.420
We haven't checked over there yet!

20:37.290 --> 20:39.280
Five skeletons.

20:40.610 --> 20:42.720
Tohya, fall back!

20:42.720 --> 20:44.680
No, my health's recovered.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.140
I'll tank!

20:47.850 --> 20:49.020
<i>They'll attack from multiple directions.</i>

20:49.020 --> 20:50.770
<i>At times like these, I must stay calm.</i>

20:52.010 --> 20:54.970
<i>First, I should cast magic 
to protect the front row.</i>

20:56.430 --> 20:59.120
<i>No... It takes too long to cast!</i>

20:59.890 --> 21:02.530
Then I'll just burn them to ash again!

21:02.530 --> 21:03.770
Wait!

21:08.500 --> 21:10.540
Wh-What's happening?

21:10.860 --> 21:14.170
Rundel Haus's aggro exceeded Tohya's!

21:19.310 --> 21:20.500
What?!

21:20.500 --> 21:21.400
It's no good!

21:21.400 --> 21:23.550
My healing magic won't make it in time!

21:24.420 --> 21:25.470
Only one thing left!

21:28.380 --> 21:30.690
Run!

21:34.170 --> 21:35.330
This is pathetic...

21:35.930 --> 21:39.480
This is truly pathetic!

21:45.150 --> 21:49.450
Your army must be very fortunate 
to have a commander like you.

21:50.090 --> 21:53.300
Your strength rivals the Eastern Knights!

21:53.630 --> 21:55.080
You flatter me.

21:55.570 --> 21:56.860
How about it?

21:56.860 --> 21:58.640
I brought some good alcohol from home.

21:58.640 --> 22:01.460
The sun's setting... 
Why not join me for a drink?

22:08.870 --> 22:10.820
I'm sorry, Lord Kiliva...

22:11.250 --> 22:13.490
But I have another engagement.

22:13.490 --> 22:15.180
Another engagement?

22:15.720 --> 22:18.090
Oh, Princess Lenessia...

22:18.420 --> 22:19.640
I understand.

22:19.640 --> 22:22.490
I can't interfere with that, after all.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.300
A pleasure to meet you.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.200
I am the adventurer Crusty.

24:05.770 --> 24:07.170
The winter rose of Eastal.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.530
Long, silvery hair,

24:09.530 --> 24:10.910
a delicate curve to her neck,

24:10.910 --> 24:13.510
a mysterious light in her blue-gray eyes.

24:13.970 --> 24:16.920
Her name is Lenessia El Arte Cowen.

24:17.290 --> 24:22.140
Her dream is to lie in bed 
all day, in her pajamas.

24:22.480 --> 24:29.990
<b>Shield and Freedom</b>

24:22.620 --> 24:24.550
Next time: Shield and Freedom.

24:24.860 --> 24:27.370
Always look thirty seconds ahead.
