IT'S MUCH BIGGER.
[laughter]

14:25.000 --> 14:26.875
- WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?
BETTER THAN DOUGHNUTS.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.041
- THIS YOUR IDEA
OF QUALITY TIME,

14:34.041 --> 14:36.291
USING YOUR SON AS COVER?

14:36.291 --> 14:38.458
- HE'S ENJOYING IT.
THEY'RE ENJOYING IT.

14:38.458 --> 14:39.709
IT'S A WIN-WIN.

14:39.709 --> 14:41.875
BESIDES,
IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.542
I NEED TO FIND OUT
WHO THIS GIRL IS

14:43.542 --> 14:47.333
BEFORE SHE WAKES UP,
WHICH WILL BE SOON.

14:50.375 --> 14:53.667
AH, DAMN IT.

14:55.834 --> 14:58.041
COME ON, COME ON...

15:11.333 --> 15:12.625

REPORT EITHER.

15:44.542 --> 15:46.125
NO ONE'S LOOKING FOR HER.

- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
I SHOULD JUST LET HER DIE?

15:47.917 --> 15:49.208
- WELL, YOU CAN'T JUST
LET HER GO.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.917
THIS ISN'T SOME FAIRY TALE
WHERE SHE WAKES UP

15:55.917 --> 15:57.917
AND YOU GET TO BE THE HANDSOME
PRINCE WHO SAVED HER.

15:57.917 --> 15:59.834
IF SHE WAKES UP,
SHE'LL CALL THE POLICE.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.834

I'VE GOT SOMEONE
EXPECTING ME.

16:39.291 --> 16:42.500
- WHAT ABOUT THE NANNY?
- SHE NEEDED A BREAK.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.709
- AFTER TWO DAYS?

16:43.709 --> 16:45.834
- IT WOULD BE A HUGE HELP.

16:45.834 --> 16:47.834
AND HE'S GONNA GO
RIGHT TO SLEEP.

16:47.834 --> 16:50.834
HE'S WAY OVERDUE
FOR A NAP.

16:50.834 --> 16:52.166
- ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU CARRY HIM TO THE CAR.

16:52.166 --> 16:56.166
HE'S GETTING HEAVY.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.000

I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT TO YOU
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY ELSE.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.041

17:13.667 --> 17:15.041

17:15.041 --> 17:16.792
HE'S THE ONE THAT SHOULD
APOLOGIZE TO ME.

17:16.792 --> 17:19.000
- HE'S THE ONE WHO HAS
A BROKEN NOSE,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.583
A BROKEN RIB,
AND A PUNCTURED LUNG.

17:21.583 --> 17:22.667
ANGEL.

BROKEN HIS JAW

17:23.709 --> 17:24.875
FOR WHAT HE SAID ABOUT YOU.

17:24.875 --> 17:26.917

BETWEEN YOU, OKAY?

17:35.625 --> 17:38.166
I'M NOT ASKING.

17:53.250 --> 17:58.667
- SORRY IF I SCARED YOU
BEFORE.

17:58.667 --> 18:01.333
MAYBE WE CAN START AGAIN?

18:06.959 --> 18:08.083
YOU PROBABLY HAVE A HEADACHE.

23:11.542 --> 23:15.208
OH, RIGHT, DEXTER MORGAN...

23:15.208 --> 23:17.750
THE PROBLEM IS LUMEN KNOWS
WAY TOO MUCH ABOUT ME,

23:17.750 --> 23:20.500
AND I KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT HER.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.834
HMM, AN UNPAID MOTEL BILL.

23:23.834 --> 23:24.875
I WAS HOPING FOR MORE,

BUT AT LEAST
IT'S A PLACE TO START.

WHAT IS THIS?

23:51.959 --> 23:53.333
- IT'S A LITTLE
TOY KEYBOARD.

23:53.333 --> 23:56.250
- NO, I MEAN WHY
AM I SITTING ON IT?

23:56.250 --> 23:57.583
WHY ARE WE LIVING
LIKE THIS?

23:57.583 --> 24:01.375
BETWEEN THE BABY STUFF
AND YOUR STUFF AND MY STUFF,

24:01.375 --> 24:02.417
WHICH I CAN BARELY SEE
ANYMORE,

24:02.417 --> 24:04.083
I FEEL LIKE A FUCKING
REFUGEE.

24:11.250 --> 24:15.417
YOU NEED SOME PEACE

24:15.417 --> 24:16.625
WE'LL HEAD OUT
FOR A WHILE.

24:16.625 --> 24:20.083

24:58.500 --> 25:00.166
- SO WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU?

25:00.166 --> 25:01.208
- UH, I'M NOT SURE.

25:01.208 --> 25:04.375
I THINK MY WIFE--
HIS MOM--

25:04.375 --> 25:06.000
MIGHT HAVE LEFT
HER LUGGAGE HERE.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.792
LUMEN PIERCE.

I REMEMBER HER.

25:24.959 --> 25:28.959
YOUR WIFE PREPAID TWO WEEKS.
IT'S BEEN OVER A MONTH.

25:28.959 --> 25:31.041
- CHANGE OF PLANS.
WE ENDED UP STAYING WITH FRIENDS

25:31.041 --> 25:32.500
IN NORTH BEACH.

25:32.500 --> 25:33.917

CHECKED OUT.

25:33.917 --> 25:37.166
WE SENT HER FILE
TO A COLLECTION AGENCY.

25:37.166 --> 25:38.875
- OH, GEE, IT'D BE
A LOT SIMPLER

25:38.875 --> 25:40.709
IF YOU'D JUST LET ME
TAKE CARE OF IT.

25:40.709 --> 25:43.000
OH, DO YOU, BY ANY CHANCE,
STILL HAVE HER LUGGAGE?

25:43.000 --> 25:45.041
- YEAH, IN STORAGE.

25:45.041 --> 25:47.834
- I'D APPRECIATE IT.
WE BOTH WOULD.

25:47.834 --> 25:49.542
- $320 AND WE'RE SQUARE.

25:49.542 --> 25:54.250
- OKAY.

- PUT YOUR JOHN HANCOCK HERE,

25:59.542 --> 26:01.625
AND I'LL GO FETCH
YOUR WIFE'S LUGGAGE.

26:01.625 --> 26:03.250

26:05.875 --> 26:08.291
TEN MONTHS OLD AND YOU'VE HAD
YOUR FIRST CIGARETTE.

42:46.166 --> 42:50.500
- HOW DO I KNOW THAT
YOU DIDN'T KILL THESE GIRLS?

42:54.792 --> 42:56.333
- YOU DON'T.

43:01.625 --> 43:06.625
IT'S A LEAP OF FAITH...
FOR BOTH OF US.

43:12.583 --> 43:15.625
MY WIFE WAS MURDERED...

43:15.625 --> 43:21.417
BRUTALLY...
BY SOMEONE LIKE BOYD.

43:21.417 --> 43:24.959
I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY MORE
INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE.

43:27.667 --> 43:30.667
HERE, YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?
TAKE IT.

43:30.667 --> 43:32.291
- NO.

43:35.583 --> 43:39.417
- TAKE IT. IT'S YOURS.

43:39.417 --> 43:41.625
- OH...

43:48.125 --> 43:50.333
- AAH!

43:56.083 --> 43:58.667
ARE YOU DONE?

44:04.917 --> 44:08.166
[Lumen sobbing]

44:18.458 --> 44:22.625
- I TELL YOU TO LEAVE
TRINITY'S FAMILY ALONE,

44:22.625 --> 44:25.208
AND INSTEAD,
YOU GO BEHIND MY BACK.

44:25.208 --> 44:28.125
AND BASED ON WHAT? THIS?

44:28.125 --> 44:29.125
A CUT-AND-PASTE SKETCH

44:29.125 --> 44:30.834
YOU THINK RESEMBLES
DEXTER MORGAN?

44:30.834 --> 44:32.625
- THE KID RECOGNIZED HIM.

44:32.625 --> 44:34.000
- HE IDENTIFIED DEXTER
AS KYLE BUTLER?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.375
- HE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE,
BUT I COULD TELL.

44:36.375 --> 44:37.667
- OH, YOU COULD TELL.

44:37.667 --> 44:40.375
AND DID JONAH CONVEY THIS I.D.
TO THE FBI?

44:40.375 --> 44:43.000
- NO.
- RIGHT.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.125
BECAUSE IT'S BULLSHIT.

44:46.125 --> 44:48.625
YOU HAVE YOUR SUSPICIONS,
YOU COME TO ME.

44:48.625 --> 44:51.208
- I TRIED.
- AND WHEN I SAY NO, QUINN,

44:51.208 --> 44:53.792
IT'S OVER!

44:56.875 --> 44:58.709
YOU'RE ON UNPAID SUSPENSION
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

44:58.709 --> 45:00.583
- SUSPENSION?

45:00.583 --> 45:02.667
- JUST TELL EVERYONE YOU'RE
TAKING A FEW VACATION DAYS.

45:02.667 --> 45:05.208
- YOU KIDDING?

45:05.208 --> 45:07.375
- AM I FUCKING KIDDING?

45:07.375 --> 45:10.083
YOU'RE LUCKY I DON'T
TERMINATE YOUR ASS.

45:10.083 --> 45:12.125
AND YOU KNOW THE ONE REASON
I DON'T?

45:12.125 --> 45:13.959
BECAUSE THERE'D BE
A MANDATORY HEARING,

45:13.959 --> 45:17.583
AND THIS WHOLE EMBARRASSMENT
WOULD BECOME A MATTER OF RECORD.

45:20.250 --> 45:22.000
NO ONE NEEDS TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR STUPID THEORIES.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.792
IT WOULD TEAR
THIS DEPARTMENT APART.

45:26.792 --> 45:28.000
UNDERSTOOD?

45:28.000 --> 45:31.333
- SURE.

45:31.333 --> 45:33.917
- HE JUST LOST HIS WIFE,
FOR CHRISSAKES!

45:46.250 --> 45:49.208
- HEY, SKEEZEY...

45:49.208 --> 45:51.458
WHERE YOU BEEN ALL DAY?

45:51.458 --> 45:54.625
- VERY LONG,
FUCKED UP STORY.

45:57.959 --> 46:00.750
I HEARD ABOUT THE RAID.

46:00.750 --> 46:02.625
- PERP GOT AWAY.

46:02.625 --> 46:05.792
- WHAT I HEARD WAS
YOU SAVED SOMEONE'S LIFE.

46:09.583 --> 46:12.583
I LET YOU DOWN.

46:12.583 --> 46:17.542
I SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE
TO BACK YOU UP.

46:17.542 --> 46:18.750
- YEAH, YOU SHOULD'VE.

46:18.750 --> 46:20.709
- YEAH.

46:23.208 --> 46:27.083
YOU OKAY?

46:27.083 --> 46:29.875
- I GUESS NOT, 'CAUSE EVERYBODY
KEEPS ASKING ME THAT.

46:34.250 --> 46:36.291
I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE
TONIGHT.

46:36.291 --> 46:42.750
- DEB, I'M, UH...

46:42.750 --> 46:44.917
NO GOOD FOR YOU.

46:44.917 --> 46:48.625
- I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR GOOD RIGHT NOW.

46:56.667 --> 46:59.083
[crickets chirping]

47:02.959 --> 47:04.667
- IS THAT TRUE...

47:04.667 --> 47:10.875
WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT YOUR WIFE?

47:10.875 --> 47:12.917
- YES.

47:18.458 --> 47:21.166
- HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

47:21.166 --> 47:24.291
- KNIFE.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.667
PAINFUL AND CRUEL.

47:41.917 --> 47:44.750
- I'M SORRY...

47:44.750 --> 47:47.291
THAT I CUT YOU.

47:49.750 --> 47:53.959
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A MONSTER, LIKE BOYD.

47:56.041 --> 47:59.500
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA KILL ME.

47:59.500 --> 48:05.333
OR WORSE.

48:05.333 --> 48:09.291
I WAS LOCKED UP.

48:09.291 --> 48:14.834
I DON'T KNOW WHERE,
OR FOR HOW LONG.

48:14.834 --> 48:18.500
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

48:21.083 --> 48:25.041
AND I THOUGHT...
IT WOULD NEVER STOP.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.750
- BUT IT HAS STOPPED.
HE'S DEAD. IT'S OVER.

48:35.750 --> 48:38.709
YOU CAN GO HOME.

48:38.709 --> 48:41.375
- I DON'T THINK SO.

48:41.375 --> 48:43.709
- YOU CAN.

48:46.917 --> 48:49.542
I READ YOUR LETTER. I KNOW
YOU HAVE A FAMILY WHO LOVES YOU.

48:49.542 --> 48:53.166
YOU SHOULD GO HOME TO THEM.

48:53.166 --> 48:57.834
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

48:57.834 --> 49:00.500
- IT IS.

49:00.500 --> 49:02.583
IT REALLY IS.

49:10.458 --> 49:13.125
- BOYD WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
WHO DID THIS TO ME.

49:15.041 --> 49:17.375
THERE WERE OTHERS.

49:26.500 --> 49:29.834
IT'S NOT OVER.
