WEBVTT

00:00.140 --> 00:01.132
Okay, everybody.

00:01.252 --> 00:03.444
I want to introduce the
rest of the workout team.

00:03.723 --> 00:05.662
This is Tracy and Jessie.

00:06.143 --> 00:09.400
Alright, we're gonna start
you off with a light jog.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.025
Just jog in place...

00:11.145 --> 00:12.879
You want to really warm up those legs.

00:12.914 --> 00:14.480
Get 'em ready for what's to come.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.515
Want to see a movie with me and Porky?

00:16.550 --> 00:18.417
Can't.
I'm doing my workout.

00:18.451 --> 00:19.876
And now, let's do some jumping Jacks.

00:19.911 --> 00:23.211
You're going to want to keep your
core tight and your arms straight.

00:23.246 --> 00:25.337
Will you get me a water?

00:25.405 --> 00:27.636
No.

00:27.671 --> 00:30.059
[Sputters]

00:30.094 --> 00:31.093
Ooh?

00:31.128 --> 00:34.121
Will you get me a water?

00:34.155 --> 00:35.046
[Groans]

00:35.080 --> 00:36.205
And now, let's go
with some squat thrusts.

00:36.239 --> 00:38.162
You know it's dangerous to work out

00:38.197 --> 00:39.595
without being properly hydrated.

00:39.629 --> 00:41.464
You're going to feel this
in your glutes.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.065
We're really going
to blast those glutes later.

00:43.100 --> 00:46.572
[Cracking]
Ohh! My glutes! Ahh. Ooh.

00:46.606 --> 00:51.342
[Groaning] They're really locked up.

01:11.150 --> 01:13.951
[Doorbell rings]

01:13.986 --> 01:15.252
Hi, Mr. Duck.

01:15.287 --> 01:16.020
I told you,

01:16.054 --> 01:19.724
you don't have
to call me Mr. Duck.

01:19.758 --> 01:22.194
It's Dr. Duck.

01:22.229 --> 01:23.527
Sorry. Um...

01:23.562 --> 01:25.194
We want to ask you something.

01:25.229 --> 01:29.631
Yes, you can have my autograph.

01:30.900 --> 01:33.535
Ok. Also,
we were wondering

01:33.569 --> 01:35.970
if you would be the coach
for our water polo team.

01:36.004 --> 01:38.873
Coach! That's a title
I've never had,

01:38.908 --> 01:41.607
or even lied about having.
What does it pay?

01:41.641 --> 01:45.744
Oh. I don't think you get any money.
It's just for fun.

01:45.778 --> 01:47.613
Fun? Let me tell
you kids something.

01:47.647 --> 01:50.649
If I'm your coach, you're not
going to have any fun,

01:50.684 --> 01:53.587
but what you are going
to have is discipline,

01:53.621 --> 01:55.855
conditioning, and wins.

01:55.889 --> 01:57.156
If you want to have fun,

01:57.190 --> 02:02.527
then go over to granny's and ask
her to be your water polo coach.

02:07.165 --> 02:10.001
Ok, fine.
We'll have a little fun.

02:10.035 --> 02:13.271
Yay!
Thanks, Dr. Duck.

02:13.306 --> 02:15.206
It's coach...

02:15.241 --> 02:17.976
Dr. Duck.

02:18.010 --> 02:20.879
What did they say I'm coaching?
Water polo?

02:20.913 --> 02:24.782
What the heck is water polo?

02:25.551 --> 02:27.152
Hey, pork.
Ready to go?

02:27.186 --> 02:31.387
[Stammering] Give me a few minutes.

02:31.821 --> 02:32.988
What's all this?

02:33.022 --> 02:35.487
I had a catering job this morning.

02:35.521 --> 02:36.722
How did it go?

02:36.756 --> 02:38.223
Oh, not so good.

02:38.257 --> 02:39.490
They barely ate anything.

02:39.525 --> 02:42.058
I don't think they liked my cooking.

02:42.093 --> 02:45.325
What? Let me try.

02:45.926 --> 02:47.527
[Grunts]

02:47.562 --> 02:48.895
You don't like it.

02:48.929 --> 02:52.163
No. It's fine.
A little bland, maybe.

02:52.197 --> 02:54.765
Let me try this guy.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.601
[Gags] Oh, Porky.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.669
Where are you getting your recipes?

02:58.704 --> 03:01.405
All these cookbooks I bought.

03:03.608 --> 03:05.175
Hmm.

03:05.210 --> 03:06.076
What's this?

03:06.110 --> 03:08.678
Those are
my grandmother's old recipes.

03:08.713 --> 03:11.914
I remember loving her food.

03:11.948 --> 03:14.648
"Flaky, creamy chicken casserole"?

03:14.683 --> 03:18.215
"Savory cheddar bread"?
"Butter pie"?

03:18.249 --> 03:19.416
These sound delicious.

03:19.450 --> 03:20.750
Why ain't you making any of these?

03:20.784 --> 03:24.385
I don't know.
They don't sound very healthy.

03:24.420 --> 03:25.753
Porky, you're a caterer.

03:25.787 --> 03:27.620
You just need them to taste good.

03:27.654 --> 03:30.121
Hmm. All right.
I'll do it.

03:30.156 --> 03:33.558
We should get going.
The movie's going to start soon.

03:33.592 --> 03:35.392
Do you have a mint, or some gum?

03:35.426 --> 03:38.659
That last one--ooh.
Not good.

03:38.694 --> 03:40.728
[Bell rings]

03:40.762 --> 03:43.163
[Whistle blows]

03:43.198 --> 03:46.567
Ok, bobcats.
Gather 'round.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.268
Take a knee.

03:48.302 --> 03:51.103
Let's see what we've got here.

03:51.138 --> 03:54.640
One boy...Two girls...

03:54.674 --> 03:56.674
And a monster.

03:56.709 --> 04:00.977
No obvious athletes,
none of you attractive.

04:01.012 --> 04:02.345
What's your name?

04:02.380 --> 04:03.546
- Emily.
- Emily?

04:03.581 --> 04:05.181
I'm never going to remember that.

04:05.215 --> 04:07.716
- What about you?
- Andrew.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.017
Yeah.
These names are impossible.

04:09.051 --> 04:11.285
You know what? I'm just going
to call everyone Jennifer.

04:11.320 --> 04:15.155
Now, Jennifer, any preexisting
injuries I should know about?

04:15.189 --> 04:16.223
- No.
- I get stomachaches.

04:16.257 --> 04:17.624
- Not really.
- What does preexisting mean?

04:17.658 --> 04:22.728
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Jennifers,
I was talking to Jennifer.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.529
Which Jennifer?

04:23.563 --> 04:25.631
Ok. I'm obviously
going to have to

04:25.665 --> 04:26.732
dumb it down for you guys.

04:26.799 --> 04:28.967
So you're Jennifer one,

04:29.001 --> 04:30.435
you're Jennifer--
Wait, no.

04:30.469 --> 04:34.440
You're Jennifer one,
you're Jennifer two,

04:34.474 --> 04:35.641
you're Jennifer three,

04:35.676 --> 04:38.578
and you're--
I was going to say Jennifer four,

04:38.612 --> 04:40.645
but you don't look like
a Jennifer four,

04:40.680 --> 04:43.281
so you're going to be Jennifer three,

04:43.315 --> 04:46.017
and you're going to be...
Emily.

04:46.051 --> 04:49.253
But that's my actual name.
Won't that be confusing?

04:49.287 --> 04:52.256
Now, let's get in the pool.

04:56.493 --> 04:58.026
[Neighing]

04:58.060 --> 05:00.628
Everyone, pick a horse!

05:00.662 --> 05:02.096
Um, coach?

05:02.130 --> 05:03.964
There aren't horses in water polo.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.467
Huh. I have a feeling
it's going to be harder

05:06.501 --> 05:10.904
to get them out of the pool
than it was to get them in it.

05:15.941 --> 05:21.076
Mmm. Porky, this is delicious.
What's in this?

05:21.111 --> 05:24.146
[Stammering]
Butter, sugar, cinnamon...

05:24.180 --> 05:26.482
Mmm. So good.

05:26.550 --> 05:29.084
Mmm. Ah.
This is even better.

05:29.119 --> 05:30.085
What's in this one?

05:30.119 --> 05:32.421
That's got butter,
sausage, heavy cream...

05:32.455 --> 05:35.590
Mm. No, this one's my favorite.
What's this one?

05:35.624 --> 05:39.728
That's not one.
That's a stick of butter.

05:39.762 --> 05:41.062
Hmm.

05:41.096 --> 05:42.330
[Grunting]

05:42.364 --> 05:43.297
[Whistle blows]

05:43.332 --> 05:45.532
Mmm. What smells so good?

05:45.566 --> 05:48.366
Porky's trying out
his grandmother's recipes.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.400
You got to try some.

05:49.434 --> 05:51.335
Can't. Swimsuit season.

05:51.369 --> 05:52.536
By the way, Bugs, from now on,

05:52.570 --> 05:55.472
- I'm holding water polo
practice in our pool. - Why?

05:55.507 --> 05:57.875
The other pool had to
be drained and resurfaced.

05:57.909 --> 06:00.678
Apparently, horses are land animals.

06:00.712 --> 06:02.580
You're coaching water polo?

06:02.614 --> 06:04.282
But I didn't think
you knew how to swim.

06:04.316 --> 06:08.452
I don't. Name reason why I,
as those children's coach,

06:08.486 --> 06:10.087
would need to know how to swim.

06:10.121 --> 06:11.955
What if one of them gets into trouble,

06:11.989 --> 06:14.191
and you need to jump in and save them?

06:14.225 --> 06:17.227
What if! What if an
asteroid hits the earth?

06:17.261 --> 06:19.362
What if robots take all our jobs?

06:19.397 --> 06:21.398
You can't live by "what if," Porky.

06:21.432 --> 06:24.601
[Laughter] That's my team now.

06:24.636 --> 06:27.372
[Grunting]

06:27.407 --> 06:28.373
Mmm.

06:28.408 --> 06:31.276
I can't stop eating this stuff.

06:31.311 --> 06:33.513
And now, all I need is
a party to cater.

06:33.548 --> 06:36.483
Why don't I have a party?
You can cater that.

06:36.518 --> 06:38.018
- Really?
- Why not?

06:38.052 --> 06:41.221
You get a job, I get to eat
your delicious food.

06:41.256 --> 06:43.592
Thanks, Bugs.

06:43.626 --> 06:45.628
Maybe one more.

06:45.662 --> 06:47.263
[Laughter] [Whistle blows]

06:47.297 --> 06:49.031
Bring it in, everybody.

06:49.066 --> 06:51.267
Take a knee.

06:51.302 --> 06:53.203
[All inhale]

06:53.237 --> 06:54.137
[Gasps]

06:54.171 --> 06:55.671
Get 'em back up!

06:55.706 --> 06:56.872
[All cough]

06:56.907 --> 06:59.141
All right, all right, calm down.

06:59.176 --> 07:00.509
You're a team now,

07:00.544 --> 07:02.378
so you got to start
acting like a team.

07:02.412 --> 07:06.047
You got to be aware of each
other in that pool. Got it?

07:06.081 --> 07:08.449
I don't want you to listen,

07:08.483 --> 07:11.252
I want you to hear.

07:11.653 --> 07:13.422
I don't want you to look,

07:13.456 --> 07:16.193
I want you to see.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.562
Now, look at me and listen up.

07:17.596 --> 07:20.532
Jennifer three,
you're going to be our captain.

07:20.566 --> 07:23.202
- I'm Jennifer three.
- I'm Jennifer one.

07:23.236 --> 07:25.605
You know what?
We've got too many Jennifers.

07:25.639 --> 07:26.673
New nicknames.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.909
You're glasses, you're freckles,

07:28.943 --> 07:30.344
and you're big teeth.

07:30.378 --> 07:31.578
What's my nickname?

07:31.613 --> 07:34.249
Hmm. I say
we stick with Emily.

07:34.283 --> 07:35.217
It suits you.

07:35.251 --> 07:36.852
All right.
Start playing.

07:36.887 --> 07:39.956
- But we don't have a ball.
- You need a ball?

07:39.990 --> 07:41.791
Taz, give me your ball.

07:41.825 --> 07:45.195
[Grunts and pants]

07:45.229 --> 07:46.329
See what's happening?

07:46.364 --> 07:50.167
He's listening, but not hearing.

07:50.201 --> 07:53.270
- [Panting]
- [Dumb dog]

07:53.305 --> 07:55.373
[Growls]

07:55.407 --> 07:57.243
Oh! My glutes!

08:04.118 --> 08:05.585
Where are you from, again?

08:05.619 --> 08:08.121
[Stammering]
Buttered scallop potato puff?

08:08.155 --> 08:11.458
Mmm. Oh, guys.
Do yourself a favor.

08:11.492 --> 08:15.396
They melt in your mouth.
I can't stop eating them.

08:15.430 --> 08:16.730
Mmm!

08:16.765 --> 08:20.103
Mmm. Butter
and molasses fritters.

08:20.137 --> 08:23.240
I haven't had one
since I was a little girl!

08:23.274 --> 08:27.444
You got to try these cheddar cheese
dumplings with creamy gravy.

08:27.479 --> 08:28.579
Mmm! [Gasps]

08:28.613 --> 08:30.882
Are those butter
and molasses fritters?

08:30.916 --> 08:33.452
When did he make those?

08:39.894 --> 08:42.630
Buh-buh-buh!
What are you doing?

08:42.664 --> 08:43.732
Eating.

08:43.765 --> 08:46.201
Do you know how much butter
there is in this stuff?

08:46.236 --> 08:47.636
You are in training!

08:47.671 --> 08:49.105
What do you think you're doing?

08:49.140 --> 08:52.615
My son had a healthy lunch,
and because I'm his mama,

08:52.649 --> 08:54.253
I told him he could have dessert.

08:54.287 --> 08:55.388
Well, I'm his coach,

08:55.455 --> 08:58.992
which means for the rest of
the season, I'm his mama.

08:59.027 --> 09:02.830
And his papa, his friend, his teacher.

09:02.865 --> 09:06.168
I'm everything to this kid,
and if you don't like it,

09:06.202 --> 09:08.504
then you shouldn't have
entrusted him in my care.

09:08.538 --> 09:13.310
I didn't. I specifically told
gossamer to stay away from you.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.312
When are you going to listen to me?

09:15.380 --> 09:18.116
What did I tell you
about these recipes, huh?

09:18.150 --> 09:19.218
You were right.

09:19.252 --> 09:21.687
The Gophers asked me to cater
for them tomorrow night.

09:21.722 --> 09:23.890
[Sputters] Tomorrow night?

09:23.925 --> 09:25.960
What am I going to eat tomorrow night?

09:25.995 --> 09:27.562
There's a ton of food here.

09:27.597 --> 09:29.264
I'm sure there will be leftovers.

09:29.298 --> 09:31.366
Are you kidding?
Look around!

09:31.401 --> 09:32.668
There's going to be nothing left!

09:32.702 --> 09:35.471
You tell those Gophers
you're busy tomorrow night.

09:35.505 --> 09:37.073
- With what?
- My party.

09:37.107 --> 09:41.845
You just had a party.
You're still having it.

09:42.414 --> 09:44.349
Tomorrow night, 8:00.

09:44.383 --> 09:47.386
And bring the butter pie.

09:55.395 --> 09:58.130
Men, this is your first game.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.465
You're probably scared.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.334
You feel like you're going to lose,

10:01.368 --> 10:03.803
maybe even get humiliated out there.

10:03.837 --> 10:07.107
Well, I know exactly how you feel.

10:07.141 --> 10:09.048
You see, years ago,

10:09.082 --> 10:10.686
I was a small-time boxer

10:10.721 --> 10:13.657
living in a tiny apartment
in Philadelphia.

10:13.692 --> 10:17.094
Out of the blue, the heavyweight
champion of the world

10:17.162 --> 10:19.363
gave me a shot at the title.

10:19.397 --> 10:21.632
He knew I didn't stand a chance,

10:21.666 --> 10:27.071
but he liked my nickname--
the Italian Stallion.

10:27.405 --> 10:32.343
One day, I met this very shy girl
named Adrian at a pet store,

10:32.377 --> 10:33.577
and we fell in love.

10:33.612 --> 10:36.380
Her brother Pauly got me a job
at his meat packing plant,

10:36.414 --> 10:40.317
where I would beat on the
carcasses hanging in the freezer.

10:40.352 --> 10:42.620
For nutrition, I ate raw eggs,

10:42.654 --> 10:46.424
and for speed, my trainer
made me chase chickens.

10:46.458 --> 10:48.860
Now, I know what you're all wondering.

10:48.894 --> 10:53.498
Did I defeat the heavyweight
champion of the world?

10:53.532 --> 10:58.731
No. But I went
the distance.

10:58.766 --> 11:00.497
And you know what that proved?

11:00.532 --> 11:05.635
That I wasn't just another bum
from the neighborhood.

11:05.669 --> 11:06.969
Wasn't that a movie?

11:07.004 --> 11:09.605
You know, I think
they did make a movie out of it.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.340
That's how incredible my story is.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.142
Ooh, remind me to tell you
about the time

11:14.176 --> 11:15.910
I was swept away in a tornado

11:15.944 --> 11:17.211
and ended up in a magical land

11:17.245 --> 11:18.846
with nothing but my little dog Toto

11:18.880 --> 11:20.480
and my ruby red slippers.

11:20.515 --> 11:23.950
But right now,
we've got a game to win!

11:23.985 --> 11:26.416
- On 3!
- 1, 2, 3!

11:26.450 --> 11:28.617
- Bobcats!
- Rocky!

11:28.651 --> 11:30.986
Bobcats.

11:36.824 --> 11:38.824

11:50.568 --> 11:52.436
[Sighs]

11:55.906 --> 11:58.140
Are you mad at us because we lost?

11:58.175 --> 12:01.843
I'm not mad at you.
I'm mad at myself.

12:01.878 --> 12:04.446
I'm your coach, your leader.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.647
I should have done more.

12:05.681 --> 12:07.315
I should have learned
the rules of the game,

12:07.383 --> 12:10.150
or at least looked up
the definition of water polo

12:10.185 --> 12:11.285
in the dictionary.

12:11.319 --> 12:12.786
But I didn't do any of that.

12:12.854 --> 12:15.655
So a lot of today's loss is on me.

12:15.689 --> 12:16.923
But most of it's on glasses,

12:16.957 --> 12:20.025
since she's our goalie, and
they scored 48 points on her.

12:20.059 --> 12:21.859
So, glasses, you're out.

12:21.894 --> 12:23.828
Freckles, you're the new goalie.

12:23.862 --> 12:27.164
Well, we'll get 'em next week.

12:27.199 --> 12:29.066
Go, bobcats!

12:29.101 --> 12:30.167
Uh-oh.

12:30.201 --> 12:33.737
Look, rabbit, I can't go to
any more of your parties.

12:33.772 --> 12:35.406
That'll be 5 this week.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.907
Please, I got to have a party tonight!

12:37.942 --> 12:40.943
Porky's making
buttered sausage biscuits!

12:40.978 --> 12:43.245
There's too much butter in that food.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.981
It's flat-out unhealthy.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.449

12:46.483 --> 12:48.083
I tried.
No one will come!

12:48.118 --> 12:50.752
You ought to lay off
that kind of food yourself.

12:59.462 --> 13:00.428

13:00.463 --> 13:02.764
I was just calling
to see if you're really having

13:02.798 --> 13:04.399
another party tonight.

13:04.433 --> 13:05.300
You better believe it.

13:05.334 --> 13:07.835
Ok. How many guests
will there be?

13:51.522 --> 13:53.030
- It's Don.

14:08.943 --> 14:11.943
Why don't we just have
gossamer be the goalie?

Emily can't be goalie.

I will be licking that trophy.

we want to be gracious winners.

go back to their loser lives,

I just stand there like a loser.

The only reason I'm valuable
is because I'm a giant monster,

17:02.483 --> 17:03.614
and I take up space.

if you're not our goalie,

we'll lose.

I don't want to let you down, coach,

17:21.994 --> 17:24.896

and feel like a winner

been football or basketball
