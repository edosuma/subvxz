QUENTIN: The way I figure it,
everyone gets a miracle.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.964
Like, maybe you hit
the Powerball jackpot.

00:42.120 --> 00:45.363
Or a last-second jumper
in the NBA Finals. (CHUCKLES)

00:45.880 --> 00:47.609
Maybe you make it to outer space...

00:47.760 --> 00:49.967
or marry the Queen of England,
or something.

00:50.120 --> 00:53.611
If you consider all the unlikely things
that happen in all the world...

00:53.760 --> 00:57.090
you gotta think at least one of them
will happen to each of us.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.843
Turns out, my miracle was different.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.445
Of all the houses

01:03.600 --> 01:06.001
in all the subdivisions
in all the state of Florida...

01:06.160 --> 01:08.242
I wound up living across the street...

01:08.400 --> 01:11.780
from Margo Roth Spiegelman.

01:11.880 --> 01:15.820
Bring your own lampshade,
somewhere there's a party

01:15.920 --> 01:20.100
Here it's never endin',
can't remember when it started

01:20.200 --> 01:21.820
Pass around the lampshade,

01:21.920 --> 01:23.780
There'll be plenty enough room in jail

01:23.880 --> 01:28.205
QUENTIN: From the moment I saw her
I was hopelessly, madly in love.

01:28.920 --> 01:33.060
If bein' wrong's a crime,
I'm serving forever

01:33.160 --> 01:34.900
If bein' strong's your kind

01:35.000 --> 01:38.527
Then I need help here with this feather

01:38.640 --> 01:40.140
QUENTIN: Due to our close proximity

01:40.240 --> 01:41.924
in both age and location...

01:42.120 --> 01:44.248
and for no other reason
I could ever discern...

01:44.400 --> 01:46.540
we soon became friends.

01:46.640 --> 01:51.168
If bein' afraid is a crime
we hang side by side

01:53.480 --> 01:59.089
At the swingin' party down the line

02:01.200 --> 02:02.326
Look.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.525
Quentin.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.445
He's dead.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.482
We should get out of here, Margo.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.160
I thought you closed
your eyes when you died.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.401
QUENTIN: The truth is...

02:28.560 --> 02:30.500
at the time, it didn't feel like

02:30.600 --> 02:31.806
that big a deal to me.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.287
It's not like I knew the guy.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.420
If I had a panic attack

02:36.520 --> 02:38.443
every time someone I didn't know died...

02:38.600 --> 02:40.220
I'd go insane.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.731
(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)

02:42.400 --> 02:44.243
It was a much bigger deal to Margo.

02:47.800 --> 02:48.881
I figured it out.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.886
His name is Robert Joyner.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.041
He was 36.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.407
Apparently he was getting divorced
and he was sad about it.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.971
How do you know all this?

02:56.120 --> 02:58.521
I'm doing an investigation. Are you in?

02:59.240 --> 03:00.241
Sure.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.562
- Great. Come on.
- Wait, what?

03:02.720 --> 03:03.881
His wife works at SeaWorld.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.724
I bet there's a clue.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.041
Margo...

03:07.200 --> 03:08.804
we can't go to SeaWorld.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.047
It's almost 11:00.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.247
I can get us in.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.526
Come on!

03:15.560 --> 03:17.289
I don't wanna get in trouble.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.882
It's a shame, don't you think?

03:23.880 --> 03:26.850
All those strings inside him broke.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.280
QUENTIN: Margo always loved mysteries.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.620
And in everything that came after,

03:49.720 --> 03:51.370
I could never stop thinking...

03:51.520 --> 03:53.727
maybe she loved them so much...

03:54.160 --> 03:55.969
she became one.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.091
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

04:05.720 --> 04:08.246
A lot changed
in the years that followed.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.881
Margo and I sort of... drifted apart.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.129
(DOORBELL RINGING)

04:36.800 --> 04:38.529
But I never stopped
thinking about her...

04:38.680 --> 04:40.887
I'll get it! I'll get it.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.409
...and hoping I'd get a second chance.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.206
CHILDREN: Trick or treat!

04:49.880 --> 04:51.860
QUENTIN: Yeah. Happy Halloween, guys.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.820
- (HONKING)
- (ENGINE REVVING)

04:53.920 --> 04:55.126
QUENTIN: It wasn't just me.

04:55.280 --> 04:58.170
Pretty much everyone recognized...

04:58.560 --> 05:00.020
Margo was different.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.460
(LAUGHING)

05:01.560 --> 05:03.722
Margo was...

05:05.480 --> 05:07.244
special.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.060
Her life had become a series

05:10.160 --> 05:12.811
of unbelievably epic adventures.

05:14.040 --> 05:16.441
Each one too insane to be true.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.540
Like the time she spent three weeks

05:18.640 --> 05:20.404
traveling with the circus.

05:22.040 --> 05:25.281
Or the time she toured with the
Mallionaires up and down the East Coast.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.851
Look, if you ask the bassist...

05:27.000 --> 05:28.780
he's either gonna say I'm his girlfriend

05:28.880 --> 05:29.881
or he wants me to be...

05:30.800 --> 05:32.928
Either way I'm going back there...

05:33.080 --> 05:35.721
so you might as well make it easier
for yourself and just let me in.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.889
QUENTIN: And wherever she went...

05:42.600 --> 05:45.604
she always left clues behind
for her little sister, Ruthie.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.260
Or anyone else she deemed worthy.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.361
(CREAKING)

05:50.640 --> 05:52.483
I was never one of those people.

06:03.240 --> 06:05.420
As senior year drew to a close,

06:05.520 --> 06:07.329
Margo and I barely talked at all.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.563
MRS. JACOBSEN: It's your senior prom.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.011
I don't understand the objection.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.447
QUENTIN: I have so many objections, Mom.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.620
Like slow dancing.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.085
And fast dancing. Any kind of dancing.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.651
And wearing a rented tux.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.370
You could take Suzie Chung.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.289
No, we're not a thing anymore.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.246
But she was such a nice girl.
What happened with you two?

06:24.440 --> 06:26.329
I don't know, it just...

06:29.840 --> 06:31.649
Just didn't work out.

06:33.680 --> 06:34.727
Hi, Ben. Hi, Radar.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.644
- Hi, Mrs. Jacobsen.
- Hey, Mrs. Jacobsen.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.929
- I would hit that so hard.
- (GROANS)

06:42.480 --> 06:43.606
I don't see it.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.841
What? Q!

06:47.000 --> 06:48.889
I'm not saying
I just wanna bang your mom.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.371
- She should be respected.
- Stop.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.921
Admired. You know, she's a real lady.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.860
Yeah, she's my mom.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.849
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I wanna ride bikes with her.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.081
What?

06:58.520 --> 07:00.887
I'd feed her grapes, take her to Paris.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.883
Treat her like the princess she is.
What, is that wrong?

07:03.040 --> 07:04.087
It's weird.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.844
It's always weird.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.020
- I wanna give her a bath.
- (GROANS)

07:09.120 --> 07:10.220
That's gonna be so...

07:10.320 --> 07:11.300
(CHUCKLING)

07:11.400 --> 07:13.140
Oh! Hold on.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.844
(LOCKER DOOR RATTLING)

07:15.240 --> 07:16.605
- Uh-oh.
- (SIGHS)

07:18.920 --> 07:21.810
Hey, honey bunny.
How's prom looking for you?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.729
Not a chance, Bloody Ben.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.849
No.

07:29.520 --> 07:30.806
No!

07:31.600 --> 07:33.523
Freshmen know that story?

07:33.840 --> 07:35.046
QUENTIN: When Ben was 12...

07:35.200 --> 07:36.380
he got a kidney infection

07:36.480 --> 07:39.086
- and started literally pissing blood.
- Oh, God.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.969
QUENTIN: By the time he came
back from the hospital...

07:41.120 --> 07:42.770
a rumor had spread through
the entire school...

07:42.920 --> 07:46.084
that his condition was the result
of chronic masturbation.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.768
I'm never gonna get a prom date, am I?

07:48.920 --> 07:49.900
Don't worry about it.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.764
Prom is a waste of time
and a waste of money.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.160
Radar's going to prom.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.243
Radar has a girlfriend,
so he has to go to prom.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.686
Lame.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.602
Radar, has she been to your house yet?

08:00.760 --> 08:03.127
Oh, yeah. Has your girlfriend
come to your house yet?

08:03.280 --> 08:04.700
- Stop.
- Isn't there a certain reason

08:04.800 --> 08:05.801
why she doesn't come to your house?

08:05.920 --> 08:06.980
Radar, what up with that?

08:07.080 --> 08:08.380
You know very well "what up with that."

08:08.480 --> 08:09.720
We just like to hear you say it.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.260
- Could you tell us again?
- (MUMBLES)

08:11.360 --> 08:12.500
- Because of what?
- I cannot hear you.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.601
Can you project?

08:13.760 --> 08:14.980
My parents own

08:15.080 --> 08:17.082
the world's largest collection
of black Santas!

08:17.240 --> 08:18.220
QUENTIN: Oh, yeah.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.731
You heard that correctly.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.840
Radar's parents were trying to get into
The Guinness Book of World Records...

08:23.000 --> 08:25.844
for the largest collection
of black Santas in one house.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.410
There were over a thousand.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.405
And they were everywhere.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.649
And not just at Christmas.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.179
Even so, Radar was the first one of us

08:36.280 --> 08:38.169
to get a serious girlfriend.

08:38.640 --> 08:39.780
RADAR: You need a prom date.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.928
Why don't you ask that girl
you slept with at summer camp?

08:42.120 --> 08:43.201
Oh. She's made up.

08:43.559 --> 08:44.500
No, she's not.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.500
But you can ask the girl
from Saskatchewan.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.364
Oh, yeah, you could ask...
Oh, no, she's also made up.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.648
No, they are both real. Not made up.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.126
- QUENTIN: Define "real."
- I don't know.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.281
Gotta go.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.321
- RADAR: Hi.
- Hey.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.051
- Hey. Let's go.
- We have 10 minutes.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.406
No, we're fine. Let's go.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.726
BEN: Hi, Angela.

09:01.840 --> 09:02.860
Bye, Angela.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.100
It was nice talking to you, Angela.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.326
Oh, God. She's great.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.487
Glad we can have these chats.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.201
QUENTIN: So most of my days
were exactly like this.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.687
I threw myself into my classes...

09:14.880 --> 09:17.690
SATs, extracurriculars.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.809
By the end of high school...

09:20.960 --> 09:22.769
I barely thought of her at all.

09:26.360 --> 09:30.300
I just had to graduate,
go off to college,

09:30.400 --> 09:31.640
find someone new.

09:34.520 --> 09:37.330
And forget the miracle ever happened.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.322
And it almost worked out that way.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.724
Until this one night.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.844
(APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS)

10:04.040 --> 10:05.769
(WINDOW SLIDES)

10:12.200 --> 10:13.361
Margo?

10:13.640 --> 10:14.641
Shh.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.490
Margo, hey.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.165
I need to borrow your car.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.606
- What?
- Your car.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.006
I don't have a car.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.446
I mean your mom's car.

10:22.640 --> 10:23.926
Why can't you use your car?

10:24.080 --> 10:25.900
My parents locked the keys in the safe

10:26.000 --> 10:27.047
beneath their bed.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.687
And while I'm sure I could go
in there and crack the combo...

10:29.840 --> 10:31.967
it just so happens
that Myrna Mountweazel's in there

10:32.120 --> 10:34.088
and that goddamn dog despises me.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.900
Anyway, so like I said,
I need to borrow your car.

10:37.000 --> 10:37.980
Mmm-mmm.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.162
Also, I need you to drive the car...

10:40.320 --> 10:42.448
because I have nine things
I need to do tonight...

10:42.600 --> 10:44.887
and more than half of them
require a getaway driver.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.447
What, are you committing felonies?

10:47.600 --> 10:49.340
Ooh. Remind me, is breaking
and entering a felony?

10:49.440 --> 10:50.460
Yes. What?

10:50.560 --> 10:51.660
- MARGO: Well.
- MR. SPIEGELMAN: Margo!

10:51.760 --> 10:52.761
Okay.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.769
I gotta go, so are you in or out?

10:54.960 --> 10:57.060
Why can't you just get one
of your underlings to help you out?

10:57.160 --> 10:58.241
Like Jase, or Lacey, or Becca?

10:58.440 --> 11:00.044
They're part of the problem, actually.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.326
What problem?

11:01.480 --> 11:03.050
There are nine problems.

11:03.480 --> 11:04.891
And your boyfriend's one of them?

11:06.000 --> 11:07.525
Ex-boyfriend.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.082
(INHALES DEEPLY) Hmm.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.401
Do you care to tell me
where we're going?

11:28.520 --> 11:29.521
(CLICKING)

11:29.760 --> 11:32.764
Uh, first, we are going to BJ's.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.645
We're going shopping?

11:36.040 --> 11:38.486
No, we're not going shopping.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.041
We are righting wrongs.
Then after that...

11:41.200 --> 11:42.929
we're gonna wrong some rights.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.769
Basically, this is gonna be
the best night of your life.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.125
Okay.

I'm not an anxious person. I just...

11:56.560 --> 11:58.244
I have plans and goals.

You said you had plans.

12:08.200 --> 12:11.124
Uh... I just meant I'm going
to Duke in the fall...

12:11.360 --> 12:12.964
then go to med school
and become an oncologist...

12:13.120 --> 12:15.407
and obviously...

12:15.560 --> 12:17.881
get married and have kids by 30.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.928
- And then you'll be happy?

Then you'll be happy.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.087
I won't say which building

38:12.360 --> 38:15.045

"Take a risk, asshole.
Stop playing it so safe."

38:29.840 --> 38:32.002
Maybe that's what she's been trying
to tell me the whole time...

38:32.120 --> 38:33.460
like with the paper towns thing.

38:33.560 --> 38:34.620
She's like...

38:34.720 --> 38:35.820
"I'm making a move, Q.

38:35.920 --> 38:38.571
"I'm going after it. Come with me."

So, if you crack the code
and find out where she is...

38:40.920 --> 38:42.570
Can I talk to you?

38:43.640 --> 38:45.005
Hi, Lacey.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.282
You were with her that night, right?

38:47.440 --> 38:49.568
The night with the Saran Wrap?

38:49.920 --> 38:50.921
Yeah.

38:51.480 --> 38:53.642
Was she mad at me?

38:53.880 --> 38:55.689
Nah, she was...

38:56.640 --> 38:57.880
disappointed.

38:58.040 --> 38:59.371
In what? What did I do?

38:59.560 --> 39:01.244
That you knew about Becca and Jase.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.488
No, see, that... That's the thing.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.563
I had no idea. If I knew,
I would've said something.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.165
Okay, Margo seemed to think that...

39:07.280 --> 39:08.281
She's wrong.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.248
Yeah, I believe you.

39:13.640 --> 39:16.140
It's just, Chuck knew this whole time,

39:16.240 --> 39:17.287
which is awesome.

39:17.840 --> 39:19.205
So, now we're broken up...

39:19.360 --> 39:21.527
and I don't have a date to prom
the week before prom...

39:21.680 --> 39:23.728
and my best friend is off
doing God knows what...

39:23.920 --> 39:26.644
thinking that I betrayed her,
which is something I would never do.

39:28.560 --> 39:29.900
I'm sorry to tell all of that to you.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.286
No, it's okay.

39:33.080 --> 39:35.606
I'm sorry, what did you say about prom?

39:36.880 --> 39:37.881
Something about a date?

39:38.040 --> 39:42.045
If you hear from her, will you tell me?

39:42.200 --> 39:43.929
Why would I hear from her?

39:44.080 --> 39:47.004
You were with her that night.
Her last night.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.889
It has to mean something.

QUENTIN: Walt Whitman's from New York.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.240

lived in New York for a while.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.401

- You think she's in New York?
- It's possible.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.804
Did she ever mention New York or...

40:08.960 --> 40:10.450
No, she didn't mention New York to me...

40:10.600 --> 40:12.204
but I didn't talk to her
for nine years, so that's...

40:12.360 --> 40:13.407
Yeah, that's true.

like the prom shoes she bought...

Hey, how soon can you get here?

54:10.400 --> 54:12.607
It's chaos. We need you. Ben needs you.

54:12.760 --> 54:16.162
No. I told you I'm not going
to Worthington's.

54:19.520 --> 54:20.681
Ben's a dick.

54:20.920 --> 54:22.001
You know what your problem is, Quentin?

54:22.120 --> 54:24.009
You keep expecting people
to not be themselves.

54:24.160 --> 54:25.969
You are not Ben. Ben is not you.

54:26.120 --> 54:28.327
We're all different people.
That's why we're best friends.

54:28.480 --> 54:29.527
All right?

54:29.680 --> 54:31.682
Get in your van and get over here.

54:32.360 --> 54:34.806
Besides, Margo's been in this
house a million times.

would put on their maps...

illegally, they'd know...

and your love of your life.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.208
Okay, yeah. All right.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.006
QUENTIN: Radar?

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.527
I don't know, guys.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.681
Come on, buddy!

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.180
If we're all going,
let's just make this a trip.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.460
RADAR: What about your parents?
What about school?

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.085
- Parents, bro.
- What about prom?

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.321
Who cares about prom?

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.527
We're not missing prom!

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.845
Okay, fine, we'll get back by prom.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.605
You're really doing this?

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.841
(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
And we're doing it now.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.764
(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
Doing it right this damn second!

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.684
We got no time to waste, Radar.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.607
Okay.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.091
- Yes!
- LACEY: Yay, Let's go!

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.600
We gotta make a stop, first.

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:05.047
You know how I told you I was
staying in to watch the Cosmos marathon?

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.441
I lied. I was at a party.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.443
Not only that...

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.284
but I drank a beer.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.966
I didn't drink it, but I held it.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.121
Girls were talking to me.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.964
And now the guys and I...

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.487
Correction. The guys and I
and Lacey Pemberton...

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.285
we're driving to New York.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.046
Wait, you're what?

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.771
It's a really long story.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.620
Are you breaking up with me?

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.960
Am I...? What?

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.089
No, no, no.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.780
I wanted to be honest with you

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.962
and I don't want you to be mad at me.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.161
Marcus,

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.170
why do I get the feeling that

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.770
you're afraid of me?

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.281
I'm not.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.727
That is... That's... What?

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.763
You pretended to like
that Ed Sheeran song

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.086
when I know you didn't.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.651
It was mixed well.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.491
You've never once invited me
to hang out with your friends.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.364
That's more about them than you.

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.285
You've never even had me
over to your house.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.484
- Uh...
- Why is that?

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.241
Hmm?

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.563
It's a story for another time.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.660
I promise, Angela,
one day I will answer that,

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.205
but not today.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.805
I'm not afraid of you.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.841
I'm afraid of losing you.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:27.441
Aw.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.609
Marcus.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.411
Angela's gonna come with us.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.486

When would we ever?

01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:47.482
This is definitely the craziest thing

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.647
I will ever do in my life.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.404

our average cruising speed should be 72.

We're gonna make it.

Excuse me, I hope you don't think that

we're gonna be back
with 20 minutes to spare.

Angela has to get her nails done.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.768
Do you know how long it takes
to put on a prom dress?

and be back in time for prom.

She has a cell.

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:43.527
How do we know that she's
even still in Agloe?

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.920
I just do.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.642
I bet she's in the middle
of the Atlantic somewhere.

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.290
On some billionaire's yacht.

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:51.860
Maybe she's been back in Orlando

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.086
watching us look for her.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.242
Nope. She's in Agloe. I promise.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:58.404
I admire your faith. It's very romantic.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.449
Thank you. I'm on a mission.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.926
I'm Captain Ahab.

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:07.326
You do realize Captain Ahab's
not the hero of that story?

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.420
Only because he didn't succeed.

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:09.540
ANGELA: I don't think that...

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:10.620
BEN: Q! Hey!

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.051
(ALL SCREAMING)

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:22.820
(SNORTS)

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.365
(MOOING)

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.290
QUENTIN: Is everyone all right?

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.531
I'm okay. Are you okay?

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.682
- Oh, my God.
- You guys okay?

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:35.405
- Hey, Ben, you okay?
- (ALL PANTING)

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:36.561
QUENTIN: Hey.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.401
Hey.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.521
Your face is bleeding.

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.006
What?

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:46.100
QUENTIN: Ooh. It's not that bad,

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.361
- (TEARING)
- It's just...

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:57.740
QUENTIN: Thanks.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:58.841
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.326
QUENTIN: Thank you. Okay, bye.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.687
All right. It's gonna be
a couple of hours.

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:09.161
All right. It looks good, considering.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:10.651
Considering we didn't die.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.404
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.687
What happened?

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.129
There was a cow
in the middle of the highway.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.770
Cow? It was a land whale.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.241
And Ben, at the last second,
grabbed the steering wheel...

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.323
spun us to safety, saves our lives.

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.820
You were a vehicular ballerina.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.160
I didn't know what I was doing.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.220
It was the best damn
passenger seat driving

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:30.529
- I've ever seen in my entire life.
- Thank you.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.282
Yeah, it's what I'm here for, so...

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.845
All right, now what do we do?

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.367
We wait.

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.761
I think we could probably
all use some rest.

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.001
Seriously.

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.729
QUENTIN: How we doing on time?

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.642
RADAR: I'll miss my hair appointment...

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.165
but a few hours won't hurt us.

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.681
BEN: Guys, before this week...

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:01.089
I think the craziest thing that we did
was sneak into Snow Dogs without paying.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:02.480
(LAUGHING) Snow Dogs.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.011
BEN: I love that movie.

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.780
Remember the time that we
stole your dad's cigars...

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:07.847
then we all smoked them
behind the house?

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.440
- You couldn't stop coughing.
- Yeah. It was gross!

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.940
That was disgusting.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.100
- I don't think you're supposed to inhale it.
- Good times.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.281
RADAR: Remember that time
when we were all

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.841
definitely gonna die but then Ben grabbed
the steering wheel and we didn't die?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.445
Pretty awesome.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.602
Thank you. Thank you.

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.125
Yeah, I can't believe it's almost over.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.520
QUENTIN: The road trip?

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:29.761
High school.

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.685
We hate high school.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.444
RADAR: He's right, though.

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.700
I've been thinking
about it a lot lately.

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.484
The lastness of it all.

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.927
The last time we'll ever
be together in the band room.

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.580
Last time we'll ever eat pizza

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.921
and nasty tater tots in the cafeteria.

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.082
Last homeroom, last science lab.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:47.651
These are all terrible, terrible things.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.609
That we're never gonna get to do again.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.460
And, like, this stuff.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.561
Hmm?

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.564
Well, I'm going to UCF.

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.140
You're going to North Carolina,

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.765
you're going to Boston.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.560
We've known each other
since we were fetuses.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.969
And it's not gonna be like that anymore.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.723
And that's gonna suck for me.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.125
Me, too.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.602
Stop. You guys are bumming me out.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.168
We can't sleep.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.481
ANGELA: You wanna take a walk?

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.766
Sure.

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.170
- LACEY: Hey.
- BEN: Hey.

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.731
You cold?

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:33.881
Yeah.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.561
Actually...

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:37.420
I'm feeling like I'm gonna probably

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.567
get some sleep, too.

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.641
Yeah.

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.771
BEN: All right, see you.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.126
LACEY: Bye.

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.402
What was it you wanted to tell me...

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:56.770
back at Jase's house,
before you puked yourself?

01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:59.081
(LAUGHS)

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.960
Nah.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.287
It was something stupid, probably.

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.445
I don't know.
I didn't really know you then.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.921
You're not kind of what I had thought.

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.321
What'd you think?

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:14.687
You know...

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:15.887
(CHUCKLING) What?

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.764
That you were hot...

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.685
and your face...

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.121
and torso.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.765
I'm sorry.

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:30.049
Listen, you are all those
things, obviously.

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:31.480
But, um...

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.403
You're also pretty cool.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:40.571
Drive all this way for your friend,
I don't know.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.728
If you ask me, someone like Margo
doesn't really deserve you.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.406
You know?

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.481
Would you wanna go to prom with me?

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.401
Yes.

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:08.580
(CHUCKLES)

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:09.727
Okay.

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:10.927
Yes.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.241
Okay.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.287
Yes.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:16.649
(LAUGHING) Wait, say that again?

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.245
You're really gonna
make me say it again?

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.289
Black Santas?

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.727
I know. I know.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:26.967
I know it sounds weird.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:29.361
It's actually 20 times
weirder in person.

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:33.561
No, I think it's progressive.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.966
(LAUGHING) No, you don't!

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.090
I do! Santa is a construct.

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.220
It doesn't make sense

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.209
that he's always an old white guy.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.740
I think that it's cool
that your parents are willing

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.604
to embrace the complexity of that idea.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.410
Yeah, I think about that
every morning...

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:51.768
when I eat my Lucky Charms
with a little black Santa spoon.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.020
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.340
You don't have to speak

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:22.525
Just keep me company

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:31.290
Be mine

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:38.242
Be mine

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:43.642
Be mine

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.481
QUENTIN: Cool. Thank you.

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:51.846
MAN: So long.

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:01.806
Hey.

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.285
What's that look on your face?

01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:07.289
What? What look?

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:10.211
You look like...
You're acting very strange.

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.686
(SCOFFS) You are.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.524
You got a weird little
grin on your face.

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:14.700
What is that about?

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:15.820
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.570
Scoot! Scoot.

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.180
Ben, did you notice something about him?

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.486
He looks kinda strange, like he's...

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:22.648
You're grinning or something.
What happened?

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:24.761
I have news.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.681
What?

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:29.044
I'm going to prom with Lacey Pemberton.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.725
- Holy shit! Really?
- Yeah.

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:31.967
- Congratulations, man.
- I know, dude.

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.451
Bloody Ben and Lacey Pemberton.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.011
Angela and I had sex.

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.161
Dude!

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.481
- BEN: What?
- What?

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:38.940
You just had sex with Angela?

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.020
Bro, are you serious?

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:41.167
Yeah. Don't tell her I told you.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.089
What are you guys talking about?

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:48.081
- Books.
- (CHUCKLES)

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.445
- Books?
- Books?

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.444
I told them.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:53.927
Bro.

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.122
I thought you could make it to Scranton.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.810
I really did.

01:22:58.960 --> 01:22:59.961
- Shotgun!
- Move!

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.571
All right, Radar, big man,
what's the ETA?

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:08.140
If we continue at yesterday's pace,
we should be there in four hours.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.220
All right.

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.527
Dude, awesome. That leaves
an hour to find Margo...

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:13.250
tell her you love her.

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.607
Back in time for an amazing prom.

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.361
Agloe, here we come.

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.521
(ENGINE STARTS)

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:27.928
BEN: Hey! Check it out,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:31.564
RADAR: This is insane.

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.841
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.620
On a drive I'm taking backroads

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:47.740
High against where
the rivers are flowing

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:52.767
I didn't think that our love had grown

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.860
Cross the bridge

01:23:55.960 --> 01:24:00.100
To redefine your pain

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.860
Wide awake

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:06.540
I rearrange the way I listen in the dark

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:11.931
Dreaming of starting up again

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.420
RADAR: According to Omnictionary,

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.931
this should be it.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.840
Margo?

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.164
(INHALES DEEPLY)

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:40.646
BEN: No?

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.290
QUENTIN: Let's look around.

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.961
Okay.

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:49.321
Yeah, all right.

(SIGHS)

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.323
How are we doing on time?

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:43.081
If we wanna make it back for prom,
we should probably...

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:45.380
go.

01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:47.482
She'll be here. I know it.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:53.051
- Q...
- She'll be here. I know it.

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.850
I know it.

01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:00.170
It's time to go, Q.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.001
He's right.

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:04.003
Guys, we can't give up yet. It's Margo.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.162
She's probably sitting,
watching right now, laughing.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.300
This is our final test.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:08.640
You promised we'd be back for prom.

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.450
Not that again. Seriously?

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:11.580
I don't wanna miss prom, either.

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:14.140
Five seconds ago, you couldn't get a date
to prom if your life depended on it.

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.227
And now, suddenly, it's the end
of the world if you're not there.

01:27:16.328 --> 01:27:20.163
Just because you don't give a shit about
prom it doesn't mean that nobody else does.

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.322
Prom is more important
than your best friend?

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.646
That's what you're saying?

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.286
No. That's not what I'm saying.

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.020
Why did you even come
if you're not gonna see this through?

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.380
Because I thought it would be fun...

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:33.100
because I wanted to spend time
with my two best friends...

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.321
before we leave for college
and probably never see each other again.

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.567
Yeah, wasn't this fun for you?

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.370
Not if I don't find Margo.
Don't you get it?

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:41.291
If I don't find Margo, it's not fun.
It's all for nothing.

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.360
(SIGHS)

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.170
Wow, okay.

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:50.521
What about you, Lacey?
Don't you wanna find her?

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:51.806
LACEY: I thought I did...

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.408
but you know what, Quentin?

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.484
I came all this way because
I was worried about her.

01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.290
Do you think she'd do the same for me?

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.448
Would she do it for you?

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.165
Come on.

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.885
I'm gonna stay.

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.420
I'm gonna find a bus back to Orlando.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:15.660
Have a great prom, everybody.

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.330
- Q.
- QUENTIN: No.

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.009
Go. Go.

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:24.885
Are you serious?

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:30.126
Q, let's go.

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.940
I'm not going! Okay? I'm not going!

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.122
All right, great. Good luck!

(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.048

- Okay.

(EXHALES)

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:02.880

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.370
Quentin.

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:15.726
Hi!

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.881
I knew I'd find you. I knew it.

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.962
I can't believe you're here.

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:32.646
How are you?

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:36.364
Wait, what? What do you mean
you can't believe I'm here?

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.729
I'm just a little surprised.

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.220
Wait, what are you surprised about?

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:41.810
I followed the clues...

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:43.450
I found that note
that you left in my door...

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:46.007
and then I saw the "You will
go to the paper towns..."

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:47.491
I read the whole Walt Whitman...

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.766
and, you know...

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.121
You left those clues for me, right?

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.409
Yeah, I always leave clues...

01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:58.580
Yeah.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:02.127
...so you'd know I was fine.
That I was okay.

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:09.684
I didn't think you would
come all this way.

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:17.002
Wait, what did you think?

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:22.051
Quentin, what are you doing here?

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:30.282
I'm in love with you.

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:37.407
You're in love with me.

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:38.925
Yes.

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:40.730
Quentin...

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:42.481
come on.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.722
I've loved you since we were kids.

01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:48.926
And I've never stopped loving you
every single day since.

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:51.202
You're not in love with me.

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:52.964
Don't say that.

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:54.804
You don't even know me.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.411
Yeah, I do. Don't say that I don't...

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.767
I don't even know me.

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:02.208
Q, I have no idea who I am.

01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:05.011
Why do you think I'm here?

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:09.801
I...

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:12.921
I thought...

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.371
Why are you here?

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:30.568
Can I buy you a drink?

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:33.041
Thank you.

01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:36.286
I'd been planning to leave
for a while, actually.

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:39.690
I would graduate,
do the whole cap and gown thing...

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:42.884
and then, the next morning... Poof.

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:44.521
Into thin air.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:48.088
And then I found out about
the whole Jase thing, and that was it.

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:50.967
I couldn't take another
second of that place.

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.285
It was really that bad?

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:54.606
You know what it's like.

01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:55.841
Yeah, but...

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:57.740
I don't know. You had everything.

01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.330
You were Margo Roth Spiegelman.

01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:01.369
That's it. That's the problem, Q.

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:03.602
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:06.047
People have always looked at me

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.447
and seen what they wanted to see.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.521
And yes, I know...

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:14.126
I cultivated it a little.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:16.806
"The myth of Margo Roth Spiegelman."

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.526
But it's just a fantasy.

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:22.920
And there we were...

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.700
at the top of the SunTrust building,

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.121
looking down on the city.

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.687
And all I could think about...

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:34.361
was how I felt just as paper
as everything else.

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:38.961
Hmm.

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.609
So then you came here?

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.130
A paper town for a paper girl.

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:49.780
Not a lot to do, but it's a great place

01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:51.405
to read and think.

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.720
Can I ask you something?

01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:57.120
Of course.

01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:02.566
Where do I fit in to all this?

01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:05.060
You were my first partner in crime.

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:07.288
I wanted you to be my last.

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:11.244
And you surprised me that night.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.410
You really did.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.924
You're a way better ninja
than I expected.

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:26.651
You know, Q, I'm really sorry.

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.211
For what?

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.001
For all of it.

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.764
The clues.

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:35.207
Not being a better friend.

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:38.402
Ruining your last few weeks
of high school.

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:46.211
You didn't.

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:47.900
What?

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.890
You didn't ruin my last
few weeks of high school.

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:52.451
In fact...

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.565
I think they were
the best weeks of my life.

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:01.928
First party.

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.050
First road trip.

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.007
My first time cutting class.

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:12.125
Everybody else is doing things
for the last time...

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:18.161
but I was doing them
for the first. So...

01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.450
don't apologize.

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:23.246
Because...

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.247
none of that would have
happened without you.

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:43.761
Are you sure you don't
want to come back?

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:48.604
College, job, husband.

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:51.001
The allure of a life rightly lived.

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.363
That's not me. You know it isn't.

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:59.364
So, what's the plan?

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:02.326
I have absolutely no idea...

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.687
but I'm excited to find out.

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:10.964
You know, you...

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:14.170
you may not be the myth
we made you out to be...

01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:17.405
but you're still pretty something.

01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:23.121
You're pretty something yourself.

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:49.562
You could come with me, you know.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.020
You can't imagine how many times

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:55.566
I dreamed you would say those words.

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:03.085
But I have to go.

01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:12.881
Hey.

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:16.844
Do you want to call your sister?

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.729
She misses you.

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.126
We talk every day.

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:26.281
(SIGHS)

01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:29.690
I'll see you.

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:49.820
What a treacherous thing it is

01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:52.161
to believe that a person
is more than a person.

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:57.647
Margo was not a miracle.
She was not an adventurer.

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:00.851
She was not some fine, precious thing.

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:04.161
She was a girl.

01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:17.443
It took me a long time
to realize how wrong I was.

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.723
And not just about Margo.

01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:27.127
I was wrong about a lot of things.

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.931
I used to believe
everyone gets a miracle.

01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:42.165
And I still do.

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.842
But as it turns out...

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:49.324
my miracle...

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:52.170
was this.

01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:55.003
Don't stop, no, I'll never give up

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.420
And I'll never look back
just hold your head up

01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.807
And if it gets rough
it's time to get rough

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:01.900
They keep saying

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.604
Don't stop, no, it's never enough

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.002
I'll never look back never give up

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.567
And if it gets rough
it's time to get rough

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:11.860
But now I'm falling, falling

01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:13.689
Falling, falling, falling

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.448
Falling, falling, falling, falling, oh

01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:20.244
Now we're going down

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:25.803
And I can feel the eyes
are watching us so closely

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:29.763
I'm trying not to make a sound

01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:34.288
'Cause I'll be found out somehow

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:37.929
Don't stop, no, I'll never give up

01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:40.100
And I'll never look back
just hold your head up

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.043
And if it gets rough
it's time to get rough

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.444
Don't stop no it's never enough

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:48.529
I'll never look back never give up

01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:50.968
And if it gets rough
it's time to get rough

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.726
So maybe we won't all win the lottery.

01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:01.961
Or marry royalty.

01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.322
Or make that last-second shot.

01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:15.651
But that doesn't mean we won't
have amazing adventures...

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:17.881
Aw...

01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:19.481
I want one.

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:21.847
...meet exceptional people...

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.161
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:28.047
and make indelible memories.

01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:33.447
The trick is...

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.685
to notice.

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:41.367
Before it's too late.

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:45.925
Oh, and Margo?

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.140
Someone said they saw her in New York,

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:52.811
starring in a revival
of The Fantasticks.

01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:57.020
Someone else said
she's on the West Coast

01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:59.521
teaching surf lessons in Malibu.

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.368
I don't listen to those rumors anymore.

01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:16.040
Wherever she is...

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:19.769
whatever she's up to...

01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:22.722
I'm sure it's pretty something.

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:26.925
But, hey...

01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:29.802
that's her story to tell.

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:33.121
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:38.300
I know it's not the right time tonight

01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:41.449
But I won't move until this stops

01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:44.040
Go back to the top

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:49.968
Back to the top

01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.242
I'm not scared if you run to me

01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:00.201
Lost like when you were mine

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:07.580
You can take what you want from me

01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:13.084
Just don't offer me your time

01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:22.122
Stay, life can be long

01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:27.411
Wanna know, wanna know,
wanna know, wanna know it's true

01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:33.247
When you say I want you around

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.644
Gotta make me believe you

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:45.020
I know it's not the right time tonight

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:48.203
But I won't move until this stops

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:50.721
Go back to the top

01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:56.448
Back to the top

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:08.940
I know it's not the right time tonight

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:12.060
But I won't move until this stops

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:14.322
Go back to the top

01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:19.528
Back to the top
