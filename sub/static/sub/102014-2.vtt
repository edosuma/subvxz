13:35.564 --> 13:39.193
Reverting back to my true nature has
given me back my strength, my stamina.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.487
That's not how medical science works.

13:42.112 --> 13:44.740
-We've cut you off at the knees.
-The hell you have.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.408
[dramatic music playing]

13:46.492 --> 13:49.870
Girls, all I need to do business
are my fists and a gun.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.207
Get the hell out of my study
before I throw you both out.

13:54.708 --> 13:55.709
Get out!

14:03.259 --> 14:04.552
[cell phone buzzing]

14:08.472 --> 14:09.473
Holy crap.

14:11.308 --> 14:14.687
-Jug, what is it? What's wrong?
-Uh, nothing's wrong.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.650
I was accepted to the University
of Iowa's writer's workshop.

14:19.733 --> 14:20.818
Are you serious?

14:20.901 --> 14:23.070
It's no Ivy League
and it's in the Midwest,

14:23.153 --> 14:26.365
but it's one of the greatest creative-
writing programs in the country.

14:26.448 --> 14:29.535
Hot damn! My boy's going to college.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.371
-I'm so proud of you.
-[Alice laughs]

14:32.454 --> 14:35.332
-[Betty] Mm.
-[Alice] This calls for a celebration.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.418
Let's get in the car, go to Pop's.

14:37.501 --> 14:40.754
All the cheeseburgers
and banana splits that we can eat, huh?

14:42.965 --> 14:43.924
[Jughead] Come on.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.010
[tender music playing]

14:54.810 --> 14:55.728
Mumzie.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.525
I've begun to think I've got work
to do here in Riverdale.

15:02.484 --> 15:03.694
Important work.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.155
Our family's redemption.

15:08.866 --> 15:12.661
I tried to reanimate the maple business,
but the Blossom board shut me down.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.204
Out of spite.

15:18.834 --> 15:24.173
They have always been a bunch
of hateful bitches. All of them.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.095
Make yourself scarce, Cheryl.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.015
Go away. But don't go alone.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.059
You'll need an alibi.

15:36.518 --> 15:41.190
Tee-Tee, I know things have been
somewhat strained

15:41.273 --> 15:43.525
since "Prom Night, Interrupted,"

15:44.485 --> 15:46.528
so what do you say you and I take

15:46.612 --> 15:50.324
a mini vacation away
from both of our families?

15:50.407 --> 15:52.785
I say, "Let's get this weekend started."

15:52.868 --> 15:54.870
[tender music playing]

15:57.081 --> 15:59.083
[scribbling noises]

16:04.463 --> 16:06.465
[dramatic music playing]

16:16.767 --> 16:19.311
No! Shut up!

16:19.395 --> 16:20.270
[Jeffrey] Stop!

16:21.480 --> 16:22.606
He didn't do it.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.943
-What?
-It was me.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.904
It was my fault. I'm sorry.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.323
I'm so sorry.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.293
[cell phone buzzing]

16:49.550 --> 16:52.052
-Hello?
-[girl] You have to help me, Betty.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.429
[thunder rumbles]

16:54.680 --> 16:56.306
Donna? What the hell?

16:57.307 --> 16:58.851
Somebody's killing us.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.478
What are you talking about?

17:01.562 --> 17:05.941
First Bret, then Joan,
and I think I'm next.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.985
My life is at stake.
I'm going into hiding.

17:08.068 --> 17:11.572
Oh, God. Give me a break,
you narcissistic psycho.

17:12.072 --> 17:15.284
There's no murder conspiracy
against your preppy cabal.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.037
<i>We know who killed Bret,</i>
<i>and now he's dead, too.</i>

17:18.120 --> 17:19.538
Then what about Joan?

17:19.621 --> 17:21.040
[suspenseful music playing]

17:21.123 --> 17:24.209
Sorry. I'm not being drawn
into your twisted reindeer games again.

17:24.293 --> 17:27.463
Whoever's doing this,
it has to be related to--

17:27.546 --> 17:30.132
Oh, to when you tried
to kill my boyfriend with a rock?

17:30.716 --> 17:32.259
<i>Yeah. Never call me again.</i>

17:32.342 --> 17:33.427
Bye, Donna.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.266
[Betty] <i>Hi, can I speak</i>
<i>to Joan Berkeley, please?</i>

17:40.059 --> 17:43.771
[woman] <i>No, I'm afraid not.</i>
<i>Joan's passed away. Who is this?</i>

17:43.854 --> 17:45.272
Oh, my God. Um...

17:46.523 --> 17:50.027
I'm a classmate of hers
from Stonewall Prep.

17:50.110 --> 17:50.944
<i>Donna?</i>

17:51.779 --> 17:53.489
Yes, it's Donna.

17:53.572 --> 17:57.284
I don't mean to upset you further,
but how did it happen?

17:57.367 --> 17:58.952
<i>Joan was murdered.</i>

17:59.036 --> 18:01.330
<i>She was walking home</i>
<i>from school through the woods,</i>

18:01.413 --> 18:04.541
<i>someone came up behind her</i>
<i>and hit her on the head with a rock.</i>

18:05.417 --> 18:09.213
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Please accept my condolences.

18:14.176 --> 18:17.554
Okay, Donna may not have been lying.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.058
Now we have a preppy murderer
on the loose?

18:22.601 --> 18:23.602
Apparently.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.313
Hope Donna's somewhere safe.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.944
I've been thinking about
Papi's stubbornness.

18:32.027 --> 18:36.573
I may have a way of breaking him of it.
It's a one-two punch.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.868
I deliver the first blow,
you deliver the second.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.413
-What are you talking about?
-Papi's delusions.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.959
He thinks that acting
like a street brawler

18:47.042 --> 18:48.919
is what's keeping him healthy.

18:49.002 --> 18:53.882
But you told me the last time
he got roughed up, he called you for help.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.509
Which you gave.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.512
So, it's time we burst his bubble

18:58.595 --> 19:01.765
and show him that you
in no way condone his behavior.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.060
What would you have me do instead?

19:06.854 --> 19:08.313
The exact opposite.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.489
-[door opens]
-[George] Archie Andrews?

19:22.703 --> 19:23.620
Mr. Augustine?

19:25.205 --> 19:26.623
What are you doing here?

19:26.707 --> 19:30.419
Look, if this is about the letter,
I haven't written it yet.

19:33.755 --> 19:36.341
There's been a change in the proceedings.

19:39.761 --> 19:43.473
My son took it upon himself
to confess to the hit-and-run.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.269
They're charging him as an adult.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.521
[dramatic music playing]

19:50.063 --> 19:52.691
Would you write the letter for him
and not me?

19:52.774 --> 19:54.109
It could mean the difference

19:54.193 --> 19:56.528
between months or years
of jail time for Jeffrey.

19:59.489 --> 20:00.824
Mr. Augustine, I've...

20:04.578 --> 20:07.581
I've thought about what your son did
over the last few months.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.337
He hit my dad.

20:15.923 --> 20:19.426
And that was an accident, yeah.
Something I might have done.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.847
But I'll tell you one thing
I never would have done:

20:27.684 --> 20:29.645
I never would have kept driving.

20:31.271 --> 20:34.316
I never would have left him or anyone.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.653
Okay, that wasn't an accident.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.740
-He was so scared.
-And what do you think my dad was?

20:52.501 --> 20:54.503
[shocking music playing]

20:58.382 --> 21:00.384
So, David wasn't the auteur?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.637
Or maybe this is one of his accomplices.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.729
[gasps] Oh, my God.

21:14.314 --> 21:17.276
He did it. He's finally got in the house.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.587
Wait, that's me.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.056
That's it. We're getting out of here.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.058
-We have to leave.
-Everybody pack a bag.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.144
We'll check into the Five Seasons.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.647
[cell phone buzzing]

21:59.943 --> 22:02.112
[Veronica sighs] Here we go.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.789
Oh, my God. Daddy, what happened?

22:12.873 --> 22:16.209
I got jumped outside the mayor's office.
Some hoods were waiting for me.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.338
Hey, can you get the first aid kit?

22:19.421 --> 22:21.423
[dramatic music playing]

22:23.967 --> 22:24.801
No.

22:32.642 --> 22:35.645
Your astrological sign might be
the scorpion, Daddy,

22:36.521 --> 22:39.733
but, in fact, you're like a dog.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.153
A dog who needs to be trained.

22:43.236 --> 22:46.281
When a dog soils a carpet,
you know what you do?

22:48.784 --> 22:50.160
You rub his nose in it.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.206
How many times is this going to happen?

22:54.998 --> 23:00.629
How many times are you gonna be attacked
and beaten by younger, stronger men?

23:00.712 --> 23:02.589
What's the point of battling a disease

23:02.672 --> 23:07.052
if you're just gonna get yourself killed
on the street like some mangy dog?

23:07.886 --> 23:09.137
Be smarter than that.

23:09.221 --> 23:12.057
Go out on top. Exit gracefully.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.350
And with dignity.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.561
Better that than to die on the street...

23:17.813 --> 23:19.606
blood flowing into the gutter.

23:23.610 --> 23:24.736
Think about that

23:25.362 --> 23:29.449
as you lick
your own wounds tonight, <i>perrito.</i>

23:43.797 --> 23:44.631
[Hermosa] Good job.

23:46.299 --> 23:48.510
Looks like you are a Lodge after all.

23:50.428 --> 23:52.681
What did you have your men do to him?

23:53.473 --> 23:55.225
He's worse than last time.

23:55.308 --> 23:58.520
Papi needed to be taught a lesson.
That's exactly what we did.

24:08.071 --> 24:09.072
Nana?

24:09.990 --> 24:11.867
Pray tell, who are you mourning?

24:12.826 --> 24:17.414
The entire Blossom family has sailed
into the underworld, Cheryl.

24:19.082 --> 24:20.542
It's just us now.

24:21.501 --> 24:23.086
What? What happened?

24:23.170 --> 24:24.880
They poisoned themselves.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.965
[dramatic music playing]

24:27.048 --> 24:32.053
A, um, suicide note
in Cricket's pocket stated

24:32.137 --> 24:38.018
that our extended family wanted
to sacrifice themselves

24:38.101 --> 24:42.230
to atone for all the ancient Blossom sins.

24:43.940 --> 24:44.816
Hmph.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.153
How timely.

24:49.529 --> 24:53.533
And, Mumzie, I'm sure
you had nothing to do with this?

24:59.247 --> 25:03.084
Consider it
an early graduation gift, Cheryl.

25:03.668 --> 25:07.047
With the Blossom board no more,
you now have full control

25:07.130 --> 25:09.966
of all Blossom holdings to do with
as you please.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.478
So, our parents have calmed down,
Jellybean's asleep,

25:21.561 --> 25:24.064
-and I'm filled with dread.
-Yeah, me, too.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.691
Jug, if the auteur got into the house,

25:26.775 --> 25:29.319
he's probably been inside
many times before.

25:29.694 --> 25:30.654
Definitely.

25:31.738 --> 25:35.408
Given the supposedly
privileged information he seems to have

25:35.492 --> 25:37.202
about us and our friends,

25:38.078 --> 25:40.872
maybe he's been doing more
than just watching.

25:41.456 --> 25:42.707
Like what, listening?

25:45.669 --> 25:46.836
You don't think...?

25:48.296 --> 25:50.382
Who likes to bug phones?

25:52.717 --> 25:56.638
Who else would have the resources
to kill Joan in the outside world

25:56.721 --> 25:58.848
and the connections
to kill Bret inside prison?

26:01.309 --> 26:04.521
-We have to go back to the house.
-Fun times, Cooper.

26:05.313 --> 26:07.315
[suspenseful music playing]

26:10.235 --> 26:11.236
[door opens]

26:12.779 --> 26:13.780
[door closes]

26:17.826 --> 26:18.952
I got your message.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.579
Thanks for coming, Charles.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.376
Found your bug.

26:28.545 --> 26:29.713
On the phone.

26:31.881 --> 26:34.884
Same kind you gave me
to use on the Stonies.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.140
You got sloppy.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.184
Or overconfident.

26:45.145 --> 26:46.980
Or maybe I wanted to be caught.

26:48.398 --> 26:49.983
Just waiting for you to catch up.

26:50.066 --> 26:54.195
You've been listening to
our phone conversations since Halloween.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.363
If not before.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.368
Yes. But only to protect you, Betty.

27:01.870 --> 27:05.623
You killed Joan and Bret. Don't lie to me.

27:06.833 --> 27:07.876
I'll know.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.380
I did. Yes.

27:14.007 --> 27:18.303
And you tried to kill Donna,
but she slipped away. Why?

27:18.386 --> 27:22.390
Donna and her friends committed
a heinous crime and got away with it.

27:23.266 --> 27:26.770
-It didn't sit well with me.
-Bret didn't. He was in prison.

27:26.853 --> 27:28.063
Bret was odious.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.065
[Jughead] Yes, he was.

27:31.149 --> 27:33.610
It took us a second
to figure out how you did it.

27:33.693 --> 27:37.155
Killing Bret in prison.
But then it made so much sense.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.326
Your boyfriend, Chic, killed him.

27:44.287 --> 27:45.538
I love you, babe.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.041
I love you, too.

27:49.209 --> 27:52.670
Bret was gonna tell us
that you and Chic were still in deep.

27:52.754 --> 27:55.048
True love knows no boundaries.

27:55.715 --> 27:59.010
I'll guess that Joan and Bret aren't
the only people you've killed.

27:59.094 --> 28:02.013
That's correct. How'd you guess?

28:02.097 --> 28:05.642
Because you taught me
everything I know about serial killers.

28:07.143 --> 28:09.771
Because that's what you are, isn't it?

28:11.606 --> 28:13.566
You're so good at identifying us.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.154
But I was your blind spot.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.741
And I only kill people who deserve it.

28:21.825 --> 28:25.036
Horrible people
who hurt those that I love. [sighs]

28:26.830 --> 28:29.707
Betty, I'm putting myself in your hands.

28:32.001 --> 28:35.088
You're going to prison
for the rest of your life.

28:35.713 --> 28:37.966
You'll come with us and you'll confess

28:38.049 --> 28:40.927
to all of your crimes,
including the videotapes.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.930
Oh, no. I'm not the auteur.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.182
Yes, you are.

28:46.933 --> 28:48.935
You killed David,
made it look like a suicide

28:49.018 --> 28:51.938
and then framed him as the auteur
because we were getting too close.

28:52.021 --> 28:53.106
[snickers]

28:53.189 --> 28:55.775
Well, yes, I... I killed David.

28:56.985 --> 29:00.196
But he was a degenerate,
who helped scumbags like Bret.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.285
-I'm not behind the videotapes.
-Who is?

29:09.330 --> 29:12.333
What kind of teacher would I be
if I just gave you the answer?

29:13.877 --> 29:15.128
You'll figure it out.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.131
I have no doubt.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.805
[Hiram] I've given some thought

29:25.889 --> 29:28.933
to what the two of you have been
saying about me...

29:30.101 --> 29:31.019
retiring.

29:32.270 --> 29:36.065
And as much as I hate to admit it,
maybe you have a point.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.943
Though, if I do choose to step down,

29:39.027 --> 29:41.154
what would that even look like?

29:41.237 --> 29:43.573
You would take a break

29:43.656 --> 29:47.118
while I go to Barnard
and Hermosa handles business affairs.

29:47.827 --> 29:48.953
[Hiram] After graduation,

29:50.163 --> 29:54.209
I'll take a long, nice sabbatical
to the Caymans.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.837
How's that sound, <i>mi amor?</i>

29:58.421 --> 29:59.506
Sounds wonderful.

30:00.715 --> 30:02.342
But I won't be joining you.

30:03.384 --> 30:05.762
I've also decided to make a life change.

30:07.806 --> 30:08.848
To do what?

30:08.932 --> 30:13.269
Three years ago, Andy Cohen asked me
to be a <i>Real Housewife of New York.</i>

30:13.353 --> 30:17.524
I turned him down
to focus on my family. Remember?

30:19.108 --> 30:20.777
But really, Veronica,

30:22.028 --> 30:23.613
I did it to protect you.

30:24.155 --> 30:28.368
The only reason I got back together
with your father in the first place

30:28.451 --> 30:30.203
was to keep you safe.

30:30.286 --> 30:33.373
But now you're going off to college.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.500
Hermosa's back in the picture,

30:35.583 --> 30:39.003
so I don't see any reason
to put my ambitions on hold.

30:40.755 --> 30:43.716
So, Hiram, I'm divorcing you.

30:45.677 --> 30:49.889
I am moving back to the city,
and I am becoming a Real Housewife.

30:50.682 --> 30:53.726
And, yes, for real.

30:55.436 --> 30:57.063
Wow, Mom.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.315
You win.

31:01.025 --> 31:05.363
But do take that trip to the Caymans.
You need a break from Riverdale.

31:05.989 --> 31:09.242
And Riverdale most definitely needs
a break from you.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.496
[Mary sobbing]

31:15.874 --> 31:18.293
[dramatic music playing]

31:18.376 --> 31:22.380
-Mom, what the hell are you doing?
-Is that what it was like for you?

31:22.922 --> 31:26.968
Is that what the Black Hood did
to your father? Did to you?

31:27.051 --> 31:28.052
I was a coward.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.638
-No!
-Yes. Mom, I let him down.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.349
No. Archie, just listen to me.

31:33.892 --> 31:37.353
I called your Uncle Frank
after George Augustine came to see you.

31:37.437 --> 31:41.149
-Wait. How did you know about that?
-He came to see me, too.

31:41.232 --> 31:46.279
Archie, please, just talk to me.
I need to know what's going on inside you.

31:46.362 --> 31:47.405
Nothing, Mom!

31:48.114 --> 31:51.242
I wish you hadn't called Uncle Frank
and you hadn't watched this.

31:51.326 --> 31:54.621
Send that to the sheriff.
Or to Betty and Jughead--

31:54.704 --> 31:56.331
So more people can see it?

31:56.998 --> 31:58.207
I got a better idea.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.878
No one will watch this crap again.

32:03.546 --> 32:07.008
Archie, no! No! No--! [screams]

32:09.886 --> 32:12.138
Archie! Archie, please stop!

32:13.222 --> 32:14.599
You're scaring me.

32:19.979 --> 32:21.439
[sobbing]

32:26.486 --> 32:27.820
[door opens]

32:31.491 --> 32:34.035
They're getting their stuff
and coming home.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.287
Jeez. Your poor mother.

32:36.996 --> 32:38.748
First Chic and now Charles?

32:41.417 --> 32:45.546
Two sons, one real,
one fake, both psychos.

32:47.674 --> 32:50.218
How are you doing?

32:51.970 --> 32:52.845
Are you okay?

32:54.305 --> 32:56.391
[tender music playing]

32:56.474 --> 32:59.102
Fine? I don't-- I don't know.

32:59.185 --> 33:02.105
Like, of course,
my brother's a serial killer.

33:03.356 --> 33:06.651
-I can't stop thinking about--
-The videotapes. Yeah.

33:06.734 --> 33:11.447
Yeah, it just made perfect sense
that Charles was the auteur.

33:13.908 --> 33:15.618
I mean, he bugged the house.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.913
He would have overheard everything
he needed to make those recreations.

33:19.455 --> 33:22.834
I don't know who else had access
to all that information.

33:25.461 --> 33:26.295
What?

33:30.008 --> 33:31.134
What is it, Jug?

33:36.264 --> 33:38.766
-[intense music playing]
-[door opens]

33:44.397 --> 33:45.523
What are you doing here?

33:45.606 --> 33:47.984
Your mom called.
She's worried about you. So am I.

33:48.067 --> 33:51.696
I'm sorry, but you don't get
to worry about me. You left.

33:51.779 --> 33:54.907
-You have no idea what I'm going through.
-You're wrong, kid.

33:54.991 --> 33:57.702
I know it better than most.
That hopelessness, the pain...

33:58.244 --> 33:59.996
We have both seen people die.

34:00.079 --> 34:02.373
And we survived.
The guilt that you carry with you?

34:02.457 --> 34:04.876
-You can't just fight--
-I don't want your advice.

34:04.959 --> 34:09.005
I don't want anything from you.
You're a fraud! You're a coward!

34:09.088 --> 34:10.590
Is that all you got?!

34:10.673 --> 34:14.010
I know you wanna hit me so do it.
Give me your best shot.

34:16.512 --> 34:17.472
Pathetic.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.100
If you wanna take me down, take me down!

34:25.813 --> 34:28.024
Let it out, Archie. Let it all out!

34:35.823 --> 34:37.408
Let go of that anger, son.

34:47.543 --> 34:48.377
[sobbing]

34:52.423 --> 34:53.341
I'm sorry.

34:57.512 --> 34:58.429
I'm sorry.

35:04.393 --> 35:05.394
[Jughead] Jellybean.

35:06.479 --> 35:09.023
I need to ask you something. Be honest.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.691
[suspenseful music playing]

35:10.775 --> 35:12.693
Are you making those videotapes?

35:17.198 --> 35:18.282
Yes.

35:23.412 --> 35:24.455
Why?

35:31.045 --> 35:33.047
[tender music playing]

35:34.757 --> 35:37.468
I don't know what I would've done
if you hadn't showed up.

35:38.594 --> 35:40.221
It's a long road you're on.

35:43.099 --> 35:44.600
Takes years to heal.

35:46.602 --> 35:48.271
Maybe even your entire life.

35:50.773 --> 35:53.985
-I really appreciate you being here.
-Any time, Archie.

35:55.736 --> 35:57.196
But if I'm being honest,

35:58.656 --> 36:00.533
you're not the only reason I came back.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.912
I'm finally ready to turn myself in.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.083
Answer for the things I did
when I was a mercenary.

36:10.001 --> 36:10.835
Really?

36:12.378 --> 36:15.798
-Are you sure?
-The only thing I need is representation.

36:16.382 --> 36:19.886
-You know any good lawyers in town?
-I might be able to think of one.

36:19.969 --> 36:21.304
[Mary chuckles]

36:26.058 --> 36:27.435
What's this about, Jug?

36:29.020 --> 36:30.813
We should do this over drinks.

36:33.065 --> 36:36.152
Betty and I found out
who's filming those videotapes.

36:36.235 --> 36:38.237
[dramatic music playing]

36:39.113 --> 36:40.323
It's Jellybean.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.868
What? What, is this a joke?

36:44.535 --> 36:47.622
No. Do you remember
that first video we were sent?

36:47.705 --> 36:49.665
It was right after I went
to Stonewall Prep.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.168
<i>That wasn't a coincidence.</i>

36:52.251 --> 36:54.420
What? What is this?

36:55.588 --> 36:56.631
[Jughead] Fast-forward.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.514
It's literally six hours of our house.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.601
You better start making sense.

37:08.684 --> 37:11.729
The videos had the intended effect:
To unsettle us.

37:11.812 --> 37:14.398
But that wasn't the reason
why Jellybean made the videos.

37:14.482 --> 37:17.193
-What? What was it?
-She wanted me to stay.

37:18.277 --> 37:20.821
The big brother she just got to know
was already leaving

37:20.905 --> 37:22.406
to Stonewall and then to college?

37:22.490 --> 37:26.661
She had figured the best way
to keep me in town was a mystery.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.623
How--? How'd she even get the idea
to make videotapes?

37:30.706 --> 37:34.460
Do you remember that weird kid
she hung out with and played G&G?

37:35.169 --> 37:36.087
<i>Ricky?</i>

37:37.630 --> 37:40.591
-Yeah.
-Well, they started hanging out again.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.010
He introduced her to Blue Velvet Video.

37:43.094 --> 37:46.555
After watching their weirder videos,
she got the idea.

37:46.639 --> 37:49.392
To film all those houses.
Jellybean and Ricky did that?

37:49.475 --> 37:51.435
At first it was just
the two of them, but...

37:52.103 --> 37:54.063
I guess they roped in
some of their friends.

37:54.146 --> 37:56.190
Some kids from Archie's community center.

37:56.274 --> 37:59.527
<i>Once the simple, voyeur footage</i>
<i>wasn't making an impact,</i>

37:59.610 --> 38:01.612
<i>especially to me,</i>
<i>she decided to up the game.</i>

38:01.696 --> 38:02.530
Guys?

38:04.365 --> 38:06.784
I have an idea. Let's make a movie.

38:07.451 --> 38:08.536
A real movie.

38:14.458 --> 38:17.461
[Jughead] <i>That first recreation?</i>
<i>You remember it? It was Betty and I.</i>

38:18.629 --> 38:20.673
<i>She wanted to get my attention,</i>
<i>and it worked.</i>

38:23.718 --> 38:26.012
Then she moved on
to the Jason Blossom recreation

38:26.095 --> 38:27.471
and Midge's murder.

38:27.555 --> 38:31.309
Her and Ricky just rented
the original videos from Blue Velvet.

38:31.392 --> 38:36.772
She and those kids made all the masks
and the props and the sets.

38:36.856 --> 38:39.400
It's actually pretty impressive.

38:39.483 --> 38:44.613
-Didn't they realize what they were doing?
-I don't think so. It was a game to them.

38:44.697 --> 38:47.033
Like make-believe.
So much so that they ended up

38:47.116 --> 38:50.786
breaking into Riverdale High to recreate
that "Killing Mr. Honey" video,

38:50.870 --> 38:54.206
<i>after she snuck on to my laptop</i>
<i>to read the story I was working on.</i>

38:55.124 --> 38:57.668
-[FP] Where did they do all this?
-All over town.

38:57.752 --> 39:00.921
Their hideout was the Lodge's cabin
in the woods. The murder cabin.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.636
<i>And then David,</i>
<i>before he was killed by Charles,</i>

39:07.720 --> 39:10.139
<i>gave them permission to shoot</i>
<i>the prom massacre video</i>

39:10.222 --> 39:11.724
<i>inside the Scarlet Suite.</i>

39:11.807 --> 39:14.352
<i>That one was bad but not as bad</i>
<i>as the one of Mr. Andrews</i>

39:14.435 --> 39:15.811
<i>being shot by the Black Hood.</i>

39:17.938 --> 39:21.567
-And the video inside our house?
-That was her and Ricky, too.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.737
She did all this to keep you in Riverdale?

39:26.197 --> 39:27.323
That's what she told me.

39:29.450 --> 39:34.413
I don't think she understands the enormity
and the darkness of what she did.

39:43.255 --> 39:44.090
Sorry.

39:44.173 --> 39:46.050
[dramatic music playing]

39:47.593 --> 39:49.011
It's okay, JB.

It's okay, honey.

39:52.640 --> 39:53.849

39:57.061 --> 39:59.480
Uncle Frank and I will visit Dad's grave.

40:00.022 --> 40:02.525
But I wanted to give you
the letter for the Augustines.

40:03.484 --> 40:07.029
