from the HPD at the time.

but we straightened that out.

04:37.082 --> 04:38.798

Kono Kalakaua--

A combat drone.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.061
KONO:
So what are you saying?

11:49.063 --> 11:51.147
A machine did this?

11:51.149 --> 11:53.516
Not on its own.

12:01.409 --> 12:04.193
Someone, somewhere,
pulled the trigger.

12:19.664 --> 12:21.311
(camera clicking)

12:30.489 --> 12:32.241
What are you guys doing here?

12:32.242 --> 12:34.125
You first.

12:34.127 --> 12:35.977
I'm on surveillance.
How'd you find me?

12:35.979 --> 12:39.331
Your mother's car has
an anti-theft device.

12:39.333 --> 12:42.334
Technology's
not my friend.

12:42.336 --> 12:44.252
Get in before
you blow my cover.

12:44.254 --> 12:45.254
No, no. Wait.

12:45.255 --> 12:46.471
I got it.

12:51.261 --> 12:53.311
That's very 1988.

12:53.313 --> 12:55.764
Okay, Jerry, I know
I'm gonna regret asking this,

12:55.766 --> 12:57.565
but what is it
that you are surveilling?

12:57.567 --> 13:00.986
What you two should be
keeping an eye on.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.605
DANNY:
Ah, good point.

13:03.607 --> 13:04.823
Girls in spandex.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.024
Next door over.

13:06.026 --> 13:07.192
Vintage books.

13:07.194 --> 13:09.027
STEVE:
What about it?

13:09.029 --> 13:11.863
Two weeks ago,
the owner came back

13:11.865 --> 13:12.914
from a trip to Dusseldorf,

13:12.916 --> 13:14.532
where he purchased
the entire inventory

13:14.534 --> 13:16.368
of a library
that was closing down.

13:17.204 --> 13:18.787
Get out of here.

13:18.789 --> 13:20.255
Well, let's go
arrest this guy.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.539
What are we doing?

13:21.541 --> 13:22.624
Not so fast, McGruff.

13:22.626 --> 13:23.758
He hasn't committed a crime yet,

13:23.760 --> 13:24.709
but he's gonna-- trust me.

13:24.711 --> 13:27.095
Okay, how do you know that?

13:27.097 --> 13:29.798
That library in
Dusseldorf was ancient.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.634
And the books inside it
were period.

13:32.636 --> 13:34.886
The paper in those books--

13:34.888 --> 13:37.889
75% cotton,
25% ultrafine linen.

13:37.891 --> 13:39.057
You know what that means?

13:39.059 --> 13:41.059
I do. It makes for
good counterfeiting stock.

13:41.061 --> 13:42.644
You, sir, are going
to the head of the class.

13:42.646 --> 13:44.029
STEVE: Just 'cause
he bought the books,

13:44.031 --> 13:45.530
it doesn't mean
he's gonna recycle the paper

13:45.532 --> 13:46.564
and start printing bills,

13:46.566 --> 13:47.532
all right?

13:47.534 --> 13:49.484
What else is he gonna do
with them?

13:49.486 --> 13:50.885
I don't know, maybe the
vintage bookshop owner

13:50.887 --> 13:52.070
is-is gonna sell them.

13:53.907 --> 13:56.908
No one reads hard-copy books
anymore-- even I know that.

13:56.910 --> 13:58.493
Jerry, you might be onto
something here, okay?

13:58.495 --> 13:59.794
But you can't
be doing this.

13:59.796 --> 14:01.379
You're a civilian.

14:01.381 --> 14:02.797
I'm a seeker of truth.

14:02.799 --> 14:04.632
DANNY: You are also
a, uh, conspiracy theorist,

14:04.634 --> 14:05.667
who still lives
with his mother

14:05.669 --> 14:07.085
and has yet to file
a tax return.

14:07.087 --> 14:08.087
Listen to me,

14:08.088 --> 14:09.954
call the HPD;
they can handle this.

14:09.956 --> 14:11.256
I did call the HPD.

14:11.258 --> 14:13.258
They treated me
like I was some sort of nut job.

14:13.260 --> 14:14.759
(laughs):
That's... shocking.

14:14.761 --> 14:16.561
STEVE: Jerry,
I'll help you dig into this,

14:16.563 --> 14:17.712
I promise, all right?
But right now,

14:17.714 --> 14:19.264
we need your help.
Take a look at this.

14:19.266 --> 14:21.266
Whoa, not here.

14:21.268 --> 14:22.934
We're too exposed.

14:25.489 --> 14:26.671
TRACY:
What is that?

14:26.673 --> 14:28.606
(mechanical clank)

14:28.608 --> 14:30.608
(automatic gunfire)

14:31.411 --> 14:33.661
Where was this taken?

14:33.663 --> 14:37.015
Here, on Oahu. This thing was
used in an attack this morning.

14:37.017 --> 14:38.450
Left two people dead.

14:38.452 --> 14:40.201
I've seen
drones before,

14:40.203 --> 14:42.287
but I've never seen
anything like that.

14:42.289 --> 14:43.788
I reached out to my
military contacts,

14:43.790 --> 14:45.173
but they wouldn't disclose
much information

14:45.175 --> 14:46.674
due to operational security.

14:46.676 --> 14:48.376
So I figured
maybe you could help.

14:49.129 --> 14:50.628
JERRY:
Okay, I'm pretty sure

14:50.630 --> 14:51.880
what we're looking at

14:51.882 --> 14:54.849
is a prototype
domestic surveillance drone.

14:54.851 --> 14:58.803
Minus the evil aftermarket
weaponized payload, of course.

14:58.805 --> 14:59.854
The government
has been denying

14:59.856 --> 15:00.889
use of domestic drones

15:00.891 --> 15:02.190
for a very long time, all right?

15:02.192 --> 15:04.109
That's why you hit a brick wall
with the military.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.144
(laughs)

15:06.146 --> 15:08.313
Think they're gonna admit to
violating your right to privacy?

15:08.315 --> 15:10.815
Better chance of getting
a backstage pass at Area 51.

15:10.817 --> 15:13.618
Okay, what about a
manufacturer? Any ideas?

15:13.620 --> 15:15.120
I seem to recall
some chatter

15:15.122 --> 15:18.456
about a drone coming
out of a super-secret advanced

15:18.458 --> 15:20.492
development program--

15:20.494 --> 15:23.978
a branch of a local military
contractor named VenPax Systems.

15:23.980 --> 15:25.997
It could be your manufacturer.

15:25.999 --> 15:27.799
Obviously,
you didn't get that from me.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.834
Obviously.

15:31.855 --> 15:34.389
VENIT:
<i>I'd like to help you guys out,</i>

15:34.391 --> 15:36.674
but the truth is
I can neither confirm nor deny

15:36.676 --> 15:38.726
that this particular UAV
belongs to us.

15:39.596 --> 15:40.678
You can't?

15:40.680 --> 15:41.896
No.

15:41.898 --> 15:44.599
Okay, well, maybe you can,
uh, "confirm or deny"

15:44.601 --> 15:46.184
that these people are dead.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.938
STEVE:
Did you know them?

15:49.940 --> 15:51.356
No.

15:51.358 --> 15:52.991
Todd Sands and Tracy Powell--
they were here on vacation.

15:52.993 --> 15:56.077
They got here on Monday,
they went to a luau,

15:56.079 --> 15:58.663
and they did a tour
of Waimea Falls Park.

15:58.665 --> 16:00.665
And now they're dead,
and I want to know why.

16:00.667 --> 16:03.785
Look, you have to understand
that this project is a matter

16:03.787 --> 16:06.121
of national security, so I can't
just answer your questions

16:06.123 --> 16:07.672
without compromising
what we're doing here.

16:07.674 --> 16:08.873
And you have
to understand,

16:08.875 --> 16:10.508
if you don't answer
our questions,

16:10.510 --> 16:13.094
the only thing you're gonna be
compromising is your freedom.

16:13.096 --> 16:15.380
Commander, we're under contract
by the military.

16:15.382 --> 16:18.049
That means that we operate under
their level of security.

16:18.051 --> 16:19.717
So threatening me
isn't gonna work.

16:21.555 --> 16:23.104
Book him, Danno.

16:23.106 --> 16:24.189
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.673
Did you hear
what I just said?

16:25.675 --> 16:26.608
Yeah, loud and clear.

16:26.610 --> 16:29.861
Put your hands
behind your back.

16:29.863 --> 16:31.529
You're under arrest
for obstruction,

16:31.531 --> 16:32.730
withholding information,

16:32.732 --> 16:34.616
and impeding a
murder investigation.

16:34.618 --> 16:36.985
None of that's gonna stick,
and you know it.

16:36.987 --> 16:38.069
STEVE:
True.

16:38.071 --> 16:39.404
But how many more
government contracts

16:39.406 --> 16:40.572
do you think you're gonna get

16:40.574 --> 16:43.458
after a background check
shows an arrest on your record?

16:43.460 --> 16:45.460
Let's go.
Okay.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.914
Okay.

16:51.668 --> 16:54.085
All right, this is QV-901.

16:54.087 --> 16:56.421
It's a surveillance drone
with no other payload,

16:56.423 --> 16:57.755
which means it flies unarmed.

16:57.757 --> 17:00.842
Three weeks ago, while it was
on a routine test flight,

17:00.844 --> 17:02.927
it was hijacked,
never recovered.

17:02.929 --> 17:04.145
How do you
hijack a drone?

17:04.146 --> 17:06.263
GPS spoofing.

17:06.266 --> 17:08.683
Somebody jammed VenPax's
control signal to the UAV,

17:08.685 --> 17:10.734
fed it false GPS data,
and made it land

17:10.737 --> 17:12.103
wherever the
hijacker wanted it.

17:12.105 --> 17:13.905
KONO: Okay, so what are
we looking at here?

17:13.906 --> 17:14.989
Inside job?

17:14.991 --> 17:16.574
Security breach?

17:16.576 --> 17:17.492
We don't know yet.

17:17.493 --> 17:18.609
Uh, VenPax gave us a list

17:18.612 --> 17:19.777
of all their current
and ex-employees

17:19.779 --> 17:20.944
that had clearance
on the project,

17:20.946 --> 17:22.997
so we should run their names
against the victims,

17:22.999 --> 17:24.449
see if we come up
with a connection.

17:24.451 --> 17:27.535
Right, and if we find one,
that might explain motive.

17:27.537 --> 17:30.288
I'll tell you something, takes
a special kind of brilliance

17:30.290 --> 17:33.291
to hijack a drone,
arm it and reprogram it.

17:33.293 --> 17:35.293
<i>We are dealing</i>
<i>with one very smart,</i>

17:35.295 --> 17:37.512
<i>very sick son of a bitch.</i>

17:45.438 --> 17:47.689
♪ ♪

17:51.194 --> 17:53.394

(screaming continues)

19:09.544 --> 19:11.294
(tires screech)

19:17.719 --> 19:20.853
Same drone that attacked
our hikers this morning.

19:20.855 --> 19:23.890
Witnesses say that it flew in,
hovered, gathering a crowd,

19:23.892 --> 19:25.441
and then bang,
opens fire.

19:25.443 --> 19:27.393
Ten seconds later,
we got five dead, 19 wounded.

19:27.395 --> 19:30.229
Chin Ho and Kono are running
I.D.'s right now

19:30.231 --> 19:31.581
to see if they can make
any connection

19:31.583 --> 19:33.232
between the victims
of both attacks.

19:33.234 --> 19:34.450
One of my guys got
a few shots off

19:34.452 --> 19:35.902
at the drone,
trying to bring it down.

19:35.904 --> 19:37.820
Bystander caught it
on video.

19:42.460 --> 19:43.910
That's good shooting.

19:43.912 --> 19:45.832
If he had missed,
more people would've been dead.

19:50.552 --> 19:52.051
We can't find
any correlation between

19:52.053 --> 19:54.253
the Kuhio Beach
and the Diamond Head victims.

19:54.255 --> 19:56.839
Which means the targets
could be random.

19:56.841 --> 19:58.891
All right, we need to start
looking at this

19:58.893 --> 20:00.176
as an act of terrorism.

20:00.178 --> 20:02.178
Except for the fact
that no group or individual

20:02.180 --> 20:03.479
has claimed
responsibility.

20:03.481 --> 20:05.231
Well, maybe
they're not done yet.

20:05.233 --> 20:06.399
Oh, good.
I'm glad you're all here.

20:06.401 --> 20:07.433
I got some more Intel

20:07.435 --> 20:08.601
on that drone
you're looking for.

20:08.603 --> 20:10.019
But first, a disclaimer.

20:10.021 --> 20:12.188
Whatever I share
with you today

20:12.190 --> 20:15.741
is in no way connected to me,
my family or anyone I know.

20:15.743 --> 20:18.778
I'm strictly here on a tour
of the palace, nothing more.

20:18.780 --> 20:20.163
Any attempt to associate me

20:20.165 --> 20:22.165
with the information
I'm about to share

20:22.167 --> 20:24.700
will be vehemently
denied by myself

20:24.702 --> 20:26.669
and the attorney I will retain.

20:26.671 --> 20:28.121
Are we understood?

20:28.123 --> 20:30.256
D-Do we... Should
we sign something, everybody?

20:30.258 --> 20:31.674
Or just, "Get on with it,"

20:31.676 --> 20:33.259
will that
suffice, Jerry?

20:34.679 --> 20:37.630
You're so naive about
how this world really works.

20:37.632 --> 20:39.265
Jerry, we get it. Get on
with it. What do you got?

20:39.267 --> 20:42.935
As far as drones go,
they may be state-of-the-art,

20:42.937 --> 20:45.688
but the technology is
still incredibly immature.

20:45.690 --> 20:47.607
They are
severely limited

20:47.609 --> 20:49.142
by a whole heap
of engineering issues,

20:49.144 --> 20:51.477
such as an unprotected
frequency band.

20:52.530 --> 20:54.814
There's just not
enough spectrum to go around.

20:56.317 --> 20:58.651
Okay.

20:58.653 --> 21:02.205
What does that mean in the
language the rest of us speak?

21:02.207 --> 21:04.540
It means that you can buy
all the equipment you need

21:04.542 --> 21:07.326
to hijack a drone
at your local hardware store.

21:07.328 --> 21:08.377
DANNY:
You can?

21:08.379 --> 21:09.962
Oh, good.
Well, then, um...

21:09.964 --> 21:12.048
Go ahead.
That should cover it. Go ahead.

21:12.050 --> 21:13.249
Okay, not so fast, Donald Trump.

21:13.251 --> 21:15.468
I can jack this thing
from your shooter.

21:15.470 --> 21:18.171
Only problem is, got to be
within 200 yards from the drone

21:18.173 --> 21:19.305
to tap into the frequency.

21:19.307 --> 21:20.673
KONO: Okay, so what
you're saying is

21:20.675 --> 21:23.259
there's nothing we can do
until it attacks again.

21:23.261 --> 21:25.845
Correction: we have to be there
when it attacks again.

21:29.517 --> 21:31.801
Sarge, some guy just called

21:31.803 --> 21:33.686
claiming he's responsible
for the drone attacks.

21:33.688 --> 21:35.338
How do we know it's real?

21:35.340 --> 21:37.523
He knew details we haven't
released to the public.

21:37.525 --> 21:38.858
Said he's gonna call back

21:38.860 --> 21:41.744
in ten minutes and wants
to speak to someone in charge.

21:41.746 --> 21:43.246
Patch him through to McGarrett.

21:43.248 --> 21:45.031
Chin, run a trace.

21:45.033 --> 21:46.666
We're on it.

21:49.170 --> 21:50.903
Almost there.
Come on, Chin.

21:53.558 --> 21:54.874
Come on, come on, Chin.
Come on, come on.

21:54.876 --> 21:57.036
Almost there, almost there.
Almost there, almost there.

21:57.161 --> 21:58.728
All right, go.

21:58.730 --> 22:01.681
This is Steve McGarrett.
Who am I talking to?

22:01.683 --> 22:04.133
(laughing)

22:04.135 --> 22:06.969
(voice scrambled): You're going to have
to do much better than that, Steve.

22:06.971 --> 22:09.305
Oh, you think this is funny?
Seven people are dead,

22:09.307 --> 22:11.057
and there's a lot more
in the hospital.

22:11.059 --> 22:14.393
On the contrary,
I think it's a tragedy.

22:14.395 --> 22:16.362
But it's nothing compared
to the hundreds

22:16.364 --> 22:18.064
killed by your drone attacks

22:18.066 --> 22:19.532
in the Middle East.

22:19.534 --> 22:22.068
You're comparing sworn enemies
of the United States

22:22.070 --> 22:23.619
to innocent civilians.

22:23.621 --> 22:26.205
There were plenty of innocents
killed in those attacks, too,

22:26.207 --> 22:28.207
Commander McGarrett.

22:28.209 --> 22:29.542
You of all people

22:29.544 --> 22:30.960
should know that.

22:30.962 --> 22:32.912
So that's what this is
about for you?

22:32.914 --> 22:34.880
Revenge? Is that right?

22:34.882 --> 22:36.749
Justice.
Justice?

22:36.751 --> 22:39.085
You want our government to
apologize for keeping us safe?

22:39.087 --> 22:41.771
No. We are way

22:41.773 --> 22:44.090
past apologies.

22:44.092 --> 22:45.975
America needs to be reminded

22:45.977 --> 22:49.395
what it's like to be terrorized.

22:49.397 --> 22:52.348
To be afraid to step outside.

22:52.350 --> 22:54.233
So you're saying
this isn't over?

22:54.235 --> 22:57.103
Not by a long shot.
Okay, hold on.

22:57.105 --> 22:58.187
Just hold on a second. Wait.

22:58.189 --> 23:00.773
Expect more blood in two hours.

23:00.775 --> 23:01.540
(line clicks)

23:01.542 --> 23:02.942
Tell me you got that.

23:02.944 --> 23:04.243
No. He must have bounced
that call

23:04.245 --> 23:06.579
off a dozen different
relay stations and satellites.

23:08.366 --> 23:10.449
Lou, call the HPD.

23:10.451 --> 23:12.084
Tell them
the island is under siege.

23:12.086 --> 23:15.288
We need to get everybody
off the streets right now.

23:18.459 --> 23:20.626
(sirens blaring)

23:26.517 --> 23:28.851
(sirens continue blaring)

23:28.853 --> 23:30.720
WOMAN (over TV):
The governor is asking everyone

23:30.722 --> 23:32.922
to remain indoors,
away from windows

23:32.924 --> 23:35.808
and do not venture outside
until further notice.

23:35.810 --> 23:37.476
Now let's go through
what we know right now.

23:37.478 --> 23:39.929
A weaponized drone
opened attack in Waikiki...

23:39.931 --> 23:42.481
Let's go, let's go, everyone!

23:42.483 --> 23:45.117
Let's go! We got to get indoors!

23:45.119 --> 23:47.486
Keep your <i>keikis</i> close!

23:47.488 --> 23:48.537
Everyone get indoors!

23:48.539 --> 23:51.624
Let's go, let's go, everyone!

23:51.626 --> 23:53.659
Keep your <i>keikis</i> close!

23:55.880 --> 23:57.830
Danno, what's going on?

23:57.832 --> 23:59.415
DANNY: Doesn't matter
what's going on, all right?

23:59.417 --> 24:01.500
Go inside, listen to
your coaches, do as they say,

24:01.502 --> 24:04.020
and I will call you
as soon as I can, all right?

24:04.022 --> 24:05.471
All right, I love you.

24:05.473 --> 24:07.006
Love you, too.

24:11.179 --> 24:14.730
MAN (over P.A.): We need everyone
off the beach right now.

24:16.668 --> 24:19.468
(sirens whooping)

24:19.470 --> 24:21.570
...evacuate.
We need everyone inside.

24:40.413 --> 24:42.413
(phone ringing)

24:46.752 --> 24:49.503
KONO:
<i>Guys, check this out.</i>

24:49.505 --> 24:51.538
I broke down the drone pilot's
call with a wave modulator

24:51.540 --> 24:53.374
and I unscrambled his voice.

24:53.376 --> 24:54.892
MAN:
America needs to be reminded

24:54.894 --> 24:56.927
what it's like to be terrorized.

24:56.929 --> 24:59.546
To be afraid to step outside.

24:59.548 --> 25:01.298
Our mystery voice

25:01.300 --> 25:05.052
belongs to a Jonathan Redmond,
an ex-VenPax employee.

25:05.054 --> 25:06.720
He was fired three years ago
for stealing company hardware.

25:06.722 --> 25:08.472
VenPax had
his voice print on file

25:08.474 --> 25:11.358
after Redmond made numerous
harassing phone calls.

25:11.360 --> 25:13.277
All right, did VenPax
ever press charges?

25:13.279 --> 25:14.561
No, they were worried

25:14.563 --> 25:16.313
that the company secrets
would get out during a trial.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.282
Yeah, well, no wonder they
didn't mention Redmond to us.

25:18.284 --> 25:21.402
A cancer like that could kill
a billion-dollar contract.

25:21.404 --> 25:23.737
But, lucky for us, Redmond
continued his thieving ways

25:23.739 --> 25:26.373
and was arrested
by HPD two years ago

25:26.375 --> 25:27.708
for several burglaries.

25:27.710 --> 25:30.127
He served 18 months, then
was paroled a few weeks ago.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.246
All right, where do
we find this punk?

25:52.935 --> 25:54.652
DANNY:
Clear.

25:54.654 --> 25:55.602
Clear.

25:55.604 --> 25:57.071
Clear.

25:59.608 --> 26:02.576
Maybe he's operating it
from a remote location.

26:02.578 --> 26:04.495
Danny, call Chin;
have him run background

26:04.497 --> 26:05.529
on Redmond's
family, friends,

26:05.531 --> 26:07.614
anybody who might know
where he is.

26:07.616 --> 26:09.283
(cell phone ringing)

26:09.285 --> 26:10.334
Kono.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.619
Hey. You find Redmond?

26:12.621 --> 26:13.921
No, he's keeping a low profile.

26:13.923 --> 26:15.589
Okay. Well, I ran
his financials.

26:15.591 --> 26:18.208
I found four wire transfers,
totaling $500,000,

26:18.210 --> 26:20.594
deposited to
an offshore account.

26:20.596 --> 26:22.429
Who sent the money?

26:22.431 --> 26:24.932
I traced it back to a textile
company here in town.

26:24.934 --> 26:26.850
The CIA thinks
it's a front for the SRS.

26:29.138 --> 26:31.055
SRS is an international
terrorist group

26:31.057 --> 26:34.191
made of the best former Soviet
Union intelligence agents.

26:34.193 --> 26:37.394
Redmond told us
he's on a rampage for revenge

26:37.396 --> 26:39.113
and ideological reasons,
but this half-a-million bucks

26:39.115 --> 26:41.482
makes me think
that's just to throw us off.

26:43.786 --> 26:46.120
Maybe this is
really about money.

26:47.573 --> 26:49.740
<i>All right, so if these SRS guys</i>

26:49.742 --> 26:51.642
are paying Redmond to
terrorize the island,

26:51.644 --> 26:53.377
the question is: why?

26:53.379 --> 26:54.878
I mean, it makes
no sense, right?

26:54.880 --> 26:56.630
I mean, if they wanted
to hit us bad,

26:56.632 --> 26:58.632
they'd have far more impact
on the mainland.

26:58.634 --> 27:00.401
Guys, I don't think we're
looking at the whole picture.

27:00.403 --> 27:02.669
I think it's about
something bigger.

27:02.671 --> 27:04.505
I dug a little deeper, and
I found more wire transfers

27:04.507 --> 27:07.257
to a systems analyst named
Lawrence Turner.

27:07.259 --> 27:08.642
Up until a
month ago,

27:08.644 --> 27:11.228
Turner was working for
a local military contractor.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.180
The CIA discovered he'd been
using his security clearance

27:13.182 --> 27:15.315
to download thousands
of classified documents.

27:15.317 --> 27:17.101
And he started selling
them, piece by piece.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.136
Let me guess--
they were bought, paid for

27:19.138 --> 27:22.022
by the same textile company
that slid Redmond the 500 racks.

27:22.024 --> 27:23.024
Exactly.

27:23.025 --> 27:24.525
Where's Turner now?

27:24.527 --> 27:26.276
Well, that's what
the CIA wants to know.

27:26.278 --> 27:27.778
When they went
to arrest him last month,

27:27.780 --> 27:29.029
he disappeared.

27:29.031 --> 27:31.198
CIA thinks that Turner's
still on the island.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.783
They have their eyes on
the ports and the airstrips.

27:32.785 --> 27:33.867
And they've been
monitoring the chatter

27:33.869 --> 27:35.119
ever since he fell
off the radar.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.336
They think he's
never left.

27:36.338 --> 27:37.871
(mechanical humming)

27:37.873 --> 27:39.706
Whoa, Sarah Connor,
I come in peace.

27:39.708 --> 27:41.925
Jerry, what the hell is that?

27:41.927 --> 27:44.011
It's how we're gonna
stop our shooter.

27:44.013 --> 27:45.929
Oh! Easy, boy.

27:48.300 --> 27:51.435
Check it out-- this thing
creates an electromagnetic field

27:51.437 --> 27:52.853
which will disrupt
our pilot's signal.

27:52.855 --> 27:55.022
All you got to do is get me
close enough to the drone,

27:55.024 --> 27:56.723
and this puppy will do the rest.
Oh, that's all.

27:56.725 --> 27:58.392
Okay. Well,
how we gonna do that?

27:59.228 --> 28:01.478
We give our shooter
a little bait.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.729
DANNY:
Bait?

28:03.949 --> 28:05.215
Like, uh...

28:07.286 --> 28:09.787
Oh, we're the, uh... the bait?

28:24.470 --> 28:26.386
JERRY:
Where are you guys?

28:26.388 --> 28:27.838
Kalakaua and Saratoga.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.090
All right, just keep
circling the block.

28:30.092 --> 28:31.592
If our guy bites,
we're two minutes away.

28:31.594 --> 28:34.595
So stupid.
This is so stupid.

28:34.597 --> 28:36.146
Okay? It's stupid.
What?

28:36.148 --> 28:37.731
What, what? I'm chum, okay?

28:37.733 --> 28:40.184
My life has been reduced
to a piece of chum.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.852
Thank you.
It's a solid plan.

28:41.854 --> 28:43.770
It's a solid plan?

28:43.772 --> 28:45.772
Now it's... It's a solid plan
hatched by a guy

28:45.774 --> 28:47.491
who believes that aliens
are living amongst us.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.610
You got a better plan?
I'd like to hear it.

28:49.612 --> 28:51.445
What, like,
right this second?

28:51.447 --> 28:53.080
No, next week.
After we've enjoyed

28:53.082 --> 28:54.248
the traffic-free roads

28:54.250 --> 28:56.250
and the no wait for a
table at BLT next week.

28:56.252 --> 28:57.784
Hey, hey! I don't need
the sarcasm, okay?

28:57.786 --> 29:00.120
I'm already risking my life.
I don't need the added sarcasm.

29:00.122 --> 29:01.288
Okay, you don't like it,
you can get out and walk.

29:01.290 --> 29:02.372
How about that?

29:02.374 --> 29:03.624
(tires screech)

29:03.626 --> 29:05.626
What is this, high school?

29:05.628 --> 29:06.628
No, look.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.430
Sir.

29:11.300 --> 29:12.799
Sir.

29:12.801 --> 29:14.134
Wake up. Get up.
Wake up.

29:14.136 --> 29:16.320
We got to get you inside, okay?

29:16.322 --> 29:18.055
You got to get indoors,
all right? Go.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.340
DANNY:
Steve!

29:20.826 --> 29:22.726
Get down! Get down!

29:31.403 --> 29:33.153
Hey, hey!

29:33.155 --> 29:34.705
We're taking fire
on Koa and Ocean!

29:34.707 --> 29:36.623
Hang on.

29:37.493 --> 29:39.409
Steve, you all right?

29:39.411 --> 29:41.545
Take cover. Go. Take cover.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.347
Come on, get up, come on.
That thing's coming back.

29:43.349 --> 29:45.382
We got to get out of here.
Come on.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.086
I can't drive, Danny.

29:49.088 --> 29:51.321
Oh, really? There's a silver
lining in the face of death.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.513
Fantastic.

29:52.536 --> 29:53.590
My leg will heal.
Don't get used to it.

29:53.592 --> 29:54.725
Come on. Let's go.

29:54.727 --> 29:57.010
(groans loudly)

30:05.237 --> 30:06.853
(tires screeching)

30:19.835 --> 30:22.336
(gunfire continues)

30:30.045 --> 30:31.962
Faster, Danny. Come on.

30:31.964 --> 30:34.214
It's going fa...
This is as fast as it goes.

30:34.216 --> 30:35.549
You know this.
You're not even redlining, okay?

30:35.551 --> 30:37.684
Look, shut up, okay?
I don't know what's worse,

30:37.686 --> 30:39.333
your driving or
your backseat driving. Zip it.

30:39.357 --> 30:40.304
(phone ringing)

30:40.306 --> 30:41.855
Kono, go ahead.
We're a little busy.

30:41.857 --> 30:43.690
KONO:
Guys, air traffic control

30:43.692 --> 30:45.442
is reporting a small aircraft
on approach.

30:45.444 --> 30:48.362
No, no, no, no, no. I thought
we shut down the airport.

30:48.364 --> 30:50.564
We did. But this thing
isn't landing at the airport.

30:50.566 --> 30:52.416
It's headed for town.

30:54.236 --> 30:56.903
Wait a minute.
We got this all wrong.

30:56.905 --> 30:58.655
This is a...
this is an aircraft extraction.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.240
The drone attack
was just a diversion.

31:00.242 --> 31:02.075
Right, they paid Redmond

31:02.077 --> 31:03.243
to clear the streets

31:03.245 --> 31:04.745
so they can land a plane

31:04.747 --> 31:06.046
and pick up Lawrence Turner.

31:06.048 --> 31:07.748
If he gets on
that plane,

31:07.750 --> 31:09.466
he'll compromise
national security.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.835
Steve.

31:11.837 --> 31:12.919
I see it.

31:30.912 --> 31:33.079
(tires screech)

31:46.394 --> 31:48.311
(automatic gunfire)

31:48.980 --> 31:49.980
Lou, where are you?

31:51.850 --> 31:53.099
Right behind you!

31:53.101 --> 31:54.350
(tires screeching)

31:55.186 --> 31:57.153
(gunfire continues)

31:58.490 --> 31:59.522
All right, come on, Jerry.

31:59.524 --> 32:01.374
It's your turn.

32:03.028 --> 32:04.577
This thing is gonna work,

32:04.579 --> 32:05.995
isn't it?

32:05.997 --> 32:07.196
Theoretically.

32:07.198 --> 32:09.499
DANNY: No, no. Wrong answer,
Jerry. Wrong answer.

32:09.501 --> 32:11.367
Okay, okay. It's gonna work.

32:11.369 --> 32:12.702
(quietly):
I think.

32:13.755 --> 32:15.722
(gunfire continues)

32:25.533 --> 32:27.634
(rapid beeping)

32:27.636 --> 32:29.869
JERRY:
<i>I got a lock on its signal!</i>

32:32.891 --> 32:34.841
<i>She's mine.</i>

32:34.843 --> 32:36.559
You got it.

32:37.779 --> 32:39.112
JERRY:
All right!

32:40.365 --> 32:42.231
One nasty killing machine down
for the count!

32:42.233 --> 32:43.900
(laughter, excited chatter
over radio)

32:43.902 --> 32:45.234
