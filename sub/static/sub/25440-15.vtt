00:47.285 --> 00:49.613
- Aha. Ah, thank you.
- Huh?

00:49.739 --> 00:51.371
Hey.
That's our last apple.

00:51.457 --> 00:54.316
Then why are you using it
for target practice?

00:54.434 --> 00:57.121
I use these breaks
to stay sharp.

00:57.315 --> 00:59.652
Good. Stay sharp
with your own apples.

00:59.738 --> 01:00.801
I'm sorry,

01:00.887 --> 01:02.410
but shouldn't the concern
here

01:02.496 --> 01:03.644
be that someone was

01:03.730 --> 01:06.118
about to shoot
an apple off my head?!

01:06.989 --> 01:09.301
Lance,
that's our last apple.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.801
Then someone
got here just in time.

01:13.743 --> 01:15.376
Apple usurper!

01:18.109 --> 01:20.595
- Oh, come on!
- I want my apple back.

01:22.658 --> 01:24.744
Don't think just because
you got horse slobber all over it,

01:24.829 --> 01:27.533
I'm not still gonna eat it.
It's about principle now.

01:27.618 --> 01:29.150
Uh-oh, Pascal.

01:29.243 --> 01:31.251
Sounds like
another apple brawl.

01:33.712 --> 01:37.087
I know, Pascal,
but I can't blame them.

01:37.316 --> 01:40.345
We've experienced
some pretty heavy stuff out here.

01:43.868 --> 01:47.525
Oh, Pascal,
this is perfect!

01:47.805 --> 01:49.931
Great news, everybody!

01:50.017 --> 01:53.720
We are going to see
Hook Hand in concert.

01:54.752 --> 01:56.923
Not only will seeing
some real live entertainment

01:57.009 --> 01:58.556
give us
a chance to unwind

01:58.642 --> 02:00.579
and get
our mind off the road...

02:01.511 --> 02:02.767
and each other,

02:02.860 --> 02:06.211
it will be
a Hook Brothers' reunion!

02:06.557 --> 02:09.532
Wow.
Thanks, Princess.

02:09.735 --> 02:13.087
Seeing my big bro perform
sounds delightful.

02:13.298 --> 02:15.384
Hmm... Oh, crackers!

02:15.470 --> 02:16.986
This concert's tomorrow
and

02:17.072 --> 02:18.650
it's all the way
in West Ipsil,

02:18.736 --> 02:20.620
that's at least
three days on foot.

02:20.705 --> 02:21.900
We'll never make it
on time.

02:21.986 --> 02:23.478
Oh well.
What's for dinner?

02:23.564 --> 02:24.650
Don't worry, Foot.

02:24.736 --> 02:26.283
I already
have it all figured out.

02:26.369 --> 02:27.861
We have plenty of time.

02:27.962 --> 02:29.822
All we have to do is
leave now,

02:29.908 --> 02:32.009
not stop to eat or drink,
and walk

02:32.095 --> 02:33.566
twice as fast as
we normally do.

02:33.651 --> 02:35.220
Oh, and no sleeping.</font>

02:35.306 --> 02:37.924
Come on, guys.
We've a show to catch.

02:44.124 --> 02:45.298
There he is.

02:47.228 --> 02:49.849
It's so good to be back.

02:50.067 --> 02:52.103
Good night, everybody!

02:52.962 --> 02:54.384
Let's go say hi.

02:57.375 --> 02:59.993
That was incredible!

03:00.079 --> 03:02.775
We... I mean, we only
got to hear two notes.

03:02.876 --> 03:05.760
And they were incredible.

03:05.935 --> 03:09.423
Hook Foot, you must be
so proud of your brother.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.197
Foot, are you okay?

03:12.532 --> 03:15.439
Okay? Yeah, I'm
better than okay.

03:15.525 --> 03:16.861
I'm thrilled.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.533
Just, uh,
tired from all the walking.

03:19.619 --> 03:22.501
I got, uh... walk lag!

03:22.587 --> 03:24.564
All right, All right!
Who's knocking?

03:24.650 --> 03:27.697
- Hey, Rapunzel!
- Hook Hand!

03:27.783 --> 03:30.368
I can't believe
you guys came all this way

03:30.462 --> 03:32.158
just to see my show.

03:32.259 --> 03:34.548
Of course.
We wouldn't miss it.

03:34.634 --> 03:36.118
Hey, Hooky.

03:36.204 --> 03:39.616
I gotta admit, I kinda-sorta
missed seeing you around Corona.

03:39.749 --> 03:41.400
Oh yeah?

03:42.001 --> 03:43.908
How 'bout a shake?

03:44.003 --> 03:45.790
Oh! I forgot.

03:45.876 --> 03:47.072
That's right,
you hate me,

03:47.158 --> 03:48.806
and you have
a really sharp hook hand.

03:48.892 --> 03:52.343
So, I'll just wave,
from over here.

03:52.876 --> 03:57.082
Wait a sec.
Razzle Dazzle, is that you?

03:57.681 --> 03:59.525
- Razzle Dazzle?
- Razzle Dazzle?

03:59.611 --> 04:01.187
Bring it in, little bro.

04:01.273 --> 04:03.892
You know, it still hurts
when you use the hook.

04:03.978 --> 04:07.900
You still dazzlin' everybody with
that silly dancin'?

04:07.986 --> 04:09.103
Whoa.

04:09.189 --> 04:11.564
Hold on a second.
Dancing?

04:11.805 --> 04:13.993
Hook Foot,
you're a dancer?

04:14.134 --> 04:16.774
- No.
- Ha! Yeah, right.

04:16.861 --> 04:20.189
Dancing was this guy's dream.
You believe that?

04:20.524 --> 04:22.697
Seriously?
How did I not know this?

04:22.783 --> 04:25.556
All right. Actually,
dancing was my dream.

04:25.695 --> 04:29.275
- But not anymore.
- Probably for the best, right?

04:29.430 --> 04:33.142
Now, who wants
a tour of my new digs?

04:35.472 --> 04:37.462
Hook Foot, you coming?

04:37.633 --> 04:41.439
Why? So I can listen to the jerk
that crushed my dreams,

04:41.595 --> 04:43.939
brag about
how he's living his?

04:44.501 --> 04:45.986
Sorry, Princess.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.911
It's just, when I was a kid,
dancing was my everything.

04:49.996 --> 04:51.415
It was my dream,

04:52.142 --> 04:54.606
but not everyone was happy
to let me have that dream.

04:56.794 --> 05:01.197
<i> You kiddin'?
Dancin's for losers.</i>

05:01.314 --> 05:04.392
<i> Then I find out he
had a fancy dream of his own.</i>

05:04.525 --> 05:06.531
<i>And when I asked
him if I could join him,</i>

05:06.617 --> 05:08.321
<i>he just laughed
in my face.</i>

05:08.406 --> 05:13.322
<i>Ha-ha.
Only losers dance, Razzle Dazzle.</i>

05:13.470 --> 05:15.514
<i> That's when
I gave it all up.</i>

05:15.600 --> 05:18.919
Oh, Hook Foot.
That sounds awful.

05:19.082 --> 05:21.587
Eh, it's ancient history,
I guess.

05:21.775 --> 05:24.751
I'm just glad this little visit
is over and the Brothers Hook

05:24.837 --> 05:27.345
can go our separate ways
yet again.

05:27.431 --> 05:30.608
Got some good news for ya.
Turns out, we're headed

05:30.693 --> 05:35.142
in the same direction.
You guys are ridin' with me.

05:38.269 --> 05:40.540
We're headed to
a very important event.

05:40.626 --> 05:43.861
It's a glamorous destination
wedding for my patron.

05:43.947 --> 05:48.118
He's a king, and he makes sure
I get everything I need,

05:48.243 --> 05:50.923
so everything's
gotta be perfect.

05:51.048 --> 05:53.598
It doesn't get more perfect than this.</font>

05:53.683 --> 05:56.267
My brother...
king...

05:56.352 --> 05:59.305
I know you're upset about
the way he treated you,

05:59.390 --> 06:01.884
but people change
over time.

06:02.007 --> 06:04.267
Haven't you changed
since then?

06:04.353 --> 06:07.806
I guess. I mean,
I groom myself now.

06:07.892 --> 06:10.947
- And I can read math.
- May I?

06:11.033 --> 06:13.361
Uh... okay.

06:18.710 --> 06:21.636
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

06:21.894 --> 06:23.084
Maybe you're right.

06:23.170 --> 06:25.886
- Maybe he has changed.
- That's the spirit.

06:25.972 --> 06:28.543
I'll give it a shot.

06:31.847 --> 06:36.307
Gotta hand it to ya, big bro,
this sure is a class joint ya got here.

06:36.392 --> 06:40.379
Yup. 'Cause to be the very best,
one must have the very best.

06:40.527 --> 06:43.882
And the best is what ya get
when you're livin' the dream.

06:44.090 --> 06:47.410
Of course, we ain't all
cut out for greatness.

06:47.503 --> 06:49.286

I can't believe
he treats you like that.

09:08.858 --> 09:11.109
- I can.
- We need a better strategy.

09:11.241 --> 09:13.204
Ooh, I got it. Revenge.

09:13.290 --> 09:14.731
I'm talking about
shock and awe.

09:14.817 --> 09:17.774
- Eugene.
- Sorry. What are we, barbarians?

09:17.860 --> 09:21.279
- But you actually are a barbarian, so...
- No. No revenge.

09:21.626 --> 09:23.259
It's time to be direct.

09:23.345 --> 09:25.665
You need to tell Hook Hand
how you really feel.

09:25.751 --> 09:28.063
We're here!
Everybody out!

09:28.173 --> 09:30.182
It's now or never.

09:30.423 --> 09:32.079
What's it gonna be?

09:32.274 --> 09:33.751
Go for revenge.

09:33.868 --> 09:36.626
- Sweet, sweet revenge.
- Shh! Eugene.

09:37.673 --> 09:41.058
Hey, big brother.
I got a bone to pick with you.

09:41.277 --> 09:44.368
I never liked that nickname
"Razzle Dazzle."

09:44.454 --> 09:47.259
And another thing.
I don't like the way you made fun

09:47.345 --> 09:49.500
of my talents and interests
growin' up.

09:49.585 --> 09:50.769
And you know what else?

09:50.854 --> 09:53.072
I demand an apology.

09:53.157 --> 09:56.174
Apologize, to you?

09:56.259 --> 10:00.178
Get over it, Razzle Dazzle.
It's ancient history.

10:00.407 --> 10:01.988
Uh, I...

10:03.977 --> 10:06.454
If he wants to act like a baby,
let him.

10:06.637 --> 10:10.384
I got a show to do and my patron
does not like to be kept waiting.

10:10.470 --> 10:12.286
He can be a real jerk.

10:12.372 --> 10:17.149
How big of a jerk do you have to be
for Hook Hand to call you a jerk?

10:17.472 --> 10:23.751
You are three minutes late, you
impunctual, lumpy-faced melody pirate!

10:23.854 --> 10:25.165
Oh... him.

10:25.931 --> 10:32.384
Everything must be perfect for
Trevor Jr.'s destination wedding.

10:33.392 --> 10:35.188
Everything!

10:35.282 --> 10:38.817
I have had it
with bullies.

10:38.902 --> 10:41.024
Now, look,
I know you're upset, Blondie.

10:41.110 --> 10:43.907
But this is a workplace dispute
between Hook Hand and his employer,

10:43.993 --> 10:47.368
and you're already on your way
to interfere, that's fantastic.

10:47.548 --> 10:51.938
- King Trevor, I don't believe we've met.
- Who do we have here?

10:52.024 --> 10:57.068
Let's see. Impossibly long golden
locks, a green shoulder slug.

10:57.153 --> 10:59.937
Princess Rapunzel, I presume?

11:00.087 --> 11:02.740
Oh. And your felonious boyfriend.

11:02.825 --> 11:04.727
You're still wanted in Equis,
you know.

11:05.954 --> 11:08.238
But I shall spare your neck
the noose,

11:08.431 --> 11:11.517
for it was your thievery
what led Trevor Jr.

11:11.602 --> 11:15.931
Into the flippers of his
true love, Lucille.

11:16.925 --> 11:20.943
Those two seals
are getting married?

11:21.130 --> 11:24.954
This is a seal wedding?

11:25.214 --> 11:28.033
Most adorable thing ever!

11:28.251 --> 11:29.802
This is not over.

11:30.095 --> 11:32.671
Congrats, you two.

11:32.845 --> 11:34.462
Listen well, buffoon.

11:34.548 --> 11:37.720
This is
the most important performance

11:37.806 --> 11:40.376
of your measly career,
do you understand me?

11:40.730 --> 11:42.733
When the ceremony has ended,

11:42.954 --> 11:45.735
I will gift the happy couple
with a dance,

11:45.909 --> 11:48.790
representing
the glory of their love.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.352
For as you know,

11:50.438 --> 11:53.985
I'm regarded as a
world-class dancer.

11:55.933 --> 12:01.353
Should one foul note find its way
into my Trevor Jr.'s ear flaps,

12:01.469 --> 12:05.750
it is back to the Stinky Weasel
with you. Is that clear?

12:05.836 --> 12:09.781
Not one foul note!

12:13.548 --> 12:16.531
Not one foul note,
huh?

12:19.781 --> 12:22.336
Revenge!

12:25.312 --> 12:27.948
Recognize this?

12:28.620 --> 12:30.683
Ha. That old thing? Yeah.

12:30.769 --> 12:33.261
It's what I wore
when I was a nobody.

12:33.390 --> 12:35.339
It's your old hook,

12:35.448 --> 12:39.222
and you wore it
when all you had was a dream.

12:39.409 --> 12:40.857
Of all people,

12:40.942 --> 12:44.275
you should know what it feels like
to have to hide your dream.

12:44.456 --> 12:46.677
Why would you do that
to somebody else?

12:46.831 --> 12:49.066
'Cause dancin' is dumb.

12:49.214 --> 12:52.969
Wrong ans... Pascal?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.383
Wrong answer, bub.

12:58.508 --> 13:00.459
Just because
you're bigger than someone,

13:00.643 --> 13:03.076
it doesn't mean that you
can look down on them.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.139
You should support
your brother.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.918
If it weren't for us
supporting your dream,

13:08.105 --> 13:10.037
you'd still be
wearing this.

13:24.675 --> 13:28.951
And now, I shall favor
the couple with my dance.

13:29.170 --> 13:31.287
Maestro Hook Hand.

13:33.676 --> 13:36.451
Enough dawdling, fool.
Play!

13:37.572 --> 13:41.772
Ladies and gentlemen, and seals.

13:41.916 --> 13:43.386
I got somethin' to say.

13:44.404 --> 13:48.590
Playing the piano for people
like you was always my dream.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.877
And I'm living my dream
because people

13:50.963 --> 13:53.212
that could've laughed at me,
didn't.

13:53.392 --> 13:56.615
But the truth is, I haven't
always been as supportive

13:56.700 --> 13:59.251
of other people's dreams
as I should have.

13:59.454 --> 14:02.589
Enough of this
sentimental hogwash.

14:02.685 --> 14:05.669
It is time for my dance.

14:05.755 --> 14:08.673
Uh, does anyone else smell fish?

14:08.759 --> 14:10.809
Always thinkin' with your stomach.

14:13.684 --> 14:14.799
Oh!

14:14.884 --> 14:19.022
No...!

14:28.599 --> 14:29.700
No!

14:39.075 --> 14:40.792
You are a failure.

14:40.877 --> 14:45.248
And as of this moment, I am
revoking my support of your music.

14:46.243 --> 14:48.963
Guards. Remove this leather-clad,

14:49.048 --> 14:52.353
silly mustached gremlin from my sight.

14:52.438 --> 14:56.749
Hold on. How dare you
talk to my brother that way?

14:56.834 --> 14:59.267
He's got more talent in that
one hand of his

14:59.352 --> 15:01.565
than you got in your entire body.

15:01.805 --> 15:05.792
Who are you to judge talent,
you chipmunk-faced meat hook?

15:05.878 --> 15:11.731
Who is he? He just happens
to be the best dancer in Corona.

15:11.824 --> 15:14.743
He could dance you
under the table any day.

15:14.829 --> 15:16.897
Unless you don't think
you have what it takes.

15:18.080 --> 15:22.748
This ruffian is the best in Corona? Ha.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.982
Rapunzel, I don't think
this is such a great idea.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.363
You can do this.

15:27.448 --> 15:31.545
If it's a dance-off he wants,
it's a dance-off he shall have.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.647
The stakes?

15:32.733 --> 15:35.428
If I lose, I shall double

15:35.519 --> 15:39.159
my contributions to this sad
sack's piano career.

15:39.338 --> 15:44.771
But if I win he'll never play
another note,

15:44.914 --> 15:48.253
ever again.</font>

15:50.346 --> 15:53.432
Let the dance-off commence!

15:53.517 --> 15:56.234
Um, a little problem here.

15:56.319 --> 16:00.938
- My piano is full of fish.
- Problem solved.

16:01.023 --> 16:04.909
I could use some accompaniment?

16:11.093 --> 16:12.388
Are you sure this is a good idea?

16:12.473 --> 16:14.559
I mean, betting Hook Hand's
entire future

16:14.644 --> 16:16.685
on that guy's ability to dance?

16:16.771 --> 16:21.460
You can't achieve a dream
without first risking failure.

16:24.881 --> 16:28.908
You shall listen as I
proclaim the dance-off rules.

16:29.126 --> 16:30.773
The first dancer goes,

16:30.952 --> 16:35.006
and second the dancer
shall match and embellish.

16:35.182 --> 16:38.557
After which Lucille
shall choose the winner.

16:38.643 --> 16:41.674
All these people here and you
pick the seal to be the judge?

16:41.872 --> 16:45.524
Of course. That is,
after all, her official title.

16:45.735 --> 16:49.855
She is... the "Seal of Approval."

16:53.040 --> 16:54.489
Step, change, pas de bourrée.

16:54.768 --> 16:56.835
Step, ball, change, pas de bourrée.

16:57.911 --> 16:59.929
Jeté. Jeté. Jeté. Jeté.

17:05.221 --> 17:09.807
It does look like
the best dancer in Corona

17:10.042 --> 17:12.477
isn't up to the challenge.

17:17.299 --> 17:18.935
Your Majesty.

17:23.198 --> 17:26.301
Woo! All right!
Get down, Hook Foot!

18:07.986 --> 18:10.336
Ugh. That's it for me.

18:10.586 --> 18:15.652
I can't do it. Not without my hook.
Maybe he's just too good.

18:15.857 --> 18:17.407
Hook Foot... I...

18:17.594 --> 18:20.160
Rapunzel, let me talk to him.

18:21.113 --> 18:24.308
Come on, Dazzle. I need
you to dig down deep,

18:24.480 --> 18:29.453
and find them guts and show this
chump what real talent looks like.

18:29.538 --> 18:32.557
But even if I wanted to, my hook...

18:32.642 --> 18:34.628
Maybe this'll help.

18:35.545 --> 18:38.864
It's only for true artistes.

18:38.949 --> 18:42.318
Now get in there, and live your dream.

18:43.236 --> 18:46.173
Couldn't have said it better
myself.

19:54.024 --> 19:58.796
Okay, that's enough. Lucille
shall now choose the winner.

20:04.070 --> 20:06.206
You know what to do.

20:11.540 --> 20:14.611
That's my little brother!

20:16.412 --> 20:19.364
This challenge is not over.
Do you hear me?

20:19.535 --> 20:21.330
It's not over.

20:24.586 --> 20:27.806
You enjoy twirling, do you?

20:27.891 --> 20:32.143
Well, get a load of this! Whoa.

20:35.394 --> 20:37.883
Oh, what utter humiliation.

20:38.003 --> 20:43.753
Smathered in tarter sauce, icing,
and mackerel. I don't deserve this!

20:43.863 --> 20:47.185
It was so great getting to
see you again, Hook Hand.

20:47.271 --> 20:48.839
You too, Princess.

20:49.026 --> 20:51.061
Thanks for everything.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.898
I'm really gonna miss you,
big brother.

20:53.995 --> 20:56.253
Well, I ain't gonna miss you.

20:56.463 --> 20:57.612
I mean,

20:57.737 --> 21:01.756
how am I gonna miss you
if you're on the road with me?

21:04.925 --> 21:07.644
Really? You mean it?

21:08.864 --> 21:13.250
But... my friends.
I'd have to leave them.

21:13.335 --> 21:17.087
Hook Foot,
we love having you with us.

21:17.214 --> 21:20.987
But this is your chance
to follow your own destiny.

21:21.377 --> 21:24.214
Go. Live your dream.

21:24.546 --> 21:29.745
Thank you. I don't think
I've ever been more happy.

21:30.135 --> 21:32.628
Okay.

21:32.714 --> 21:35.274
I thought the moment brought us
over this emotional hump. My bad.

21:35.392 --> 21:36.612
Misread.

21:37.394 --> 21:40.198
- I'm gonna miss that guy.
- Me too.

21:40.517 --> 21:41.765
Maybe.

21:41.851 --> 21:45.245
Yeah, underneath their rough
exteriors, the Hook Brothers

21:45.331 --> 21:48.269
are really sweet
and thoughtful guys.

21:48.737 --> 21:50.454
Except for the fact that
they left us

21:50.539 --> 21:53.597
in the middle of nowhere,
without transportation.

21:53.879 --> 21:56.276
No groaning, people.

21:56.362 --> 21:59.296
We've got a destiny
to discover.

21:59.382 --> 22:01.003
Now, move out!
