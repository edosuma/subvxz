WEBVTT

00:01.902 --> 00:05.173
Coming up on midnight, JJ.
18, here we come.

00:05.273 --> 00:06.674
How can we be
celebrating this?

00:06.774 --> 00:08.409
It's not a birthday.
It's a kidnapping.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.211
This baby has vanished,

00:10.311 --> 00:12.046
and he's been replaced
by some...

00:12.146 --> 00:14.115
strange man.
-15 seconds, JJ.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.884
If you want to kill someone
and not be tried as an adult,

00:16.984 --> 00:18.286
now's your chance.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.720
Huh.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.355
5 seconds.
All right, kids.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.590
We all know why we're here.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.725
Three...two...

00:24.825 --> 00:28.262
ALL: You look way too young
to have an adult son.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.265
Oh, I quite like that.

00:31.365 --> 00:35.136
**

00:35.236 --> 00:37.938
Okay, JJ,
so, about your party --

00:38.038 --> 00:39.273
we've got you the same cake
every year.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.275
Do you still want
Fudgie the Whale,

00:41.375 --> 00:43.111
or do you want something
a bit more grown up?

00:44.578 --> 00:46.414
"Dylan wants Fudgie."

00:46.514 --> 00:48.882
What?
No, I never said that.

00:48.982 --> 00:51.419
"Dylan. Wants. Fudgie!"

00:51.519 --> 00:54.888
Fine. I'll be your fall guy,
but watch the tone.

00:54.988 --> 00:58.259
I've got five years to kill you
with no consequences.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.261
I-I wanna be clear --
that's -- that's not the case.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.096
So, I understand you're
going to do something special

01:02.196 --> 01:04.398
with Kenneth
to celebrate 18.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.100
You have my permission.
-"Don't need it."

01:06.200 --> 01:07.301
-Yeah, well, it's there.
-"Don't want it."

01:07.401 --> 01:08.802
Just take it!

01:08.902 --> 01:10.938
But do remember
the only acceptable tattoo

01:11.038 --> 01:13.641
is a heart with the word "Mum"
written inside it,

01:13.741 --> 01:15.443
and only then
if you're in a coma

01:15.543 --> 01:16.844
and you have no other way
of telling people

01:16.944 --> 01:18.078
how much you love
your mother.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.980
No tattoos.
Thank you.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.117
That's the one thing
you can't do.
Got it.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.419
And here's a list of the other
things you can't do.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.587
RAY: Hey, guys.

01:26.687 --> 01:27.955
Taylor is on her way over

01:28.055 --> 01:29.623
with her new
foreign-exchange student.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.759
"Ooh, JJ like-y."

01:31.859 --> 01:33.827
Eww.
Make him read the weird stuff.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.096
As it happens,
Lars is a guy.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.499
Um, Taylor's got a guy
staying with her?

01:38.599 --> 01:41.535
Yes.
And I'm beyond okay with it.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.437
It's modern times, and there's
nothing more masculine

01:43.537 --> 01:44.505
than trusting a woman.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.475
"Doing some
American guy's girlfriend

01:47.575 --> 01:48.942
is more masculine."

01:51.879 --> 01:55.015
Hi, Ray.
This is Lars.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.685
Hi, Lars.
It's so nice to meet you.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.687
This is boy
who give me jacket?

01:59.787 --> 02:02.122
I'm the boy who's gonna
lend you a jacket.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.525
But I'm so much more
than that.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.460
Taylor and I are, uh...

02:07.561 --> 02:09.163
This is like
baby jacket.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.633
Well, gotta go.
Lars is taking me to school.

02:12.733 --> 02:13.734
He drives,
which is awesome.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.669
Why don't I just
come with you?

02:15.769 --> 02:17.305
But you go to
a different school.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.506
Yeah, I'll just take a ride
to your school

02:18.606 --> 02:20.641
and then hitch a ride to mine,
save us all some time.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.577
Easy peasy.
Okay.

02:23.677 --> 02:26.747
**

02:26.847 --> 02:31.051
Hey, maybe Taylor's not into
the obscenely beautiful.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.420
Exactly.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.356
Well, the cuckold's horns
aren't gonna wear themselves.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.059
**

02:41.862 --> 02:43.897
That spitball
you were shooting --

02:43.997 --> 02:46.033
really funny,
by the way, big fan --

02:46.133 --> 02:47.435
except yours hit me.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.203
What are you gonna do
about it?

02:51.672 --> 02:53.274
I don't know.
Any suggestions?

02:53.374 --> 02:56.176
Hey!
Come with me.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.711
Detention?

02:57.811 --> 02:59.247
Today doesn't really work
for me.

02:59.347 --> 03:02.049
Let's make plans
for another time.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.617
I don't want to give you
detention.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.952
I want you to join
my wrestling team.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.755
You took down that bigger kid.
I think you got what it takes.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.022
Now that I got
a stepdaughter,

03:09.122 --> 03:12.059
I think girls should be allowed
to do stuff like this.

03:12.159 --> 03:14.194
Huh.
Thanks for the context?

03:14.295 --> 03:16.063
But I am not a wrestler.

03:16.163 --> 03:17.631
I'm a runner.
I'm fast, too.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.233
Hey, what's that
over there?

03:19.333 --> 03:21.469
Me making
the perfect getaway.

03:23.070 --> 03:26.874
I'm so sorry.
I am insanely fast, so...

03:26.974 --> 03:28.742
that must have hurt.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.044
No, I-I-I'm sorry.

03:31.144 --> 03:34.315
My body is like rock hard,
so that -- that had to hurt.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.550
I guess we're both
perfect specimens.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.253
Nice to meet you.
Dylan.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.588
I'm Rev.

03:40.688 --> 03:44.458
COACH: Revere! You're late.
Get over here.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.928
Your weird boy sport --
Maybe I'll check it out.

03:48.028 --> 03:50.431
JJ, my of-age friend,

03:50.531 --> 03:53.801
this is the place to get
this party started.

03:53.901 --> 03:57.905
(Todd Rundgren's
Bang the Drum All Day plays)
Somewhere a man
can be a man.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.643
* I don't want to work

04:02.743 --> 04:05.446
* I want to bang on the drum
all day *

04:05.546 --> 04:07.348
We would like
some lottery tickets,

04:07.448 --> 04:09.850
some butane,
and your cheapest cigar.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.852
You just turn 18?

04:11.952 --> 04:13.153
Let's do this.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.989
* Ever since I was a tiny boy
Nice.

04:16.089 --> 04:20.328
* I don't want no candy,
I don't need toy *
Drowsy or non

04:20.428 --> 04:22.430
* I took a stick
and an old coffee can *
Non-drowsy.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.965
I think you'll be very happy
with that.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.100
* I got blisters on my hand
because *

04:27.200 --> 04:28.669
* I don't want to work

04:28.769 --> 04:30.938
I rented a documentary
I thought was porn.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.506
It really changed
my take.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.608
* I don't want to work

04:34.708 --> 04:36.810
Let me ask you this --
are you one of those normal

04:36.944 --> 04:39.980
just-turned-18 kids,
or do you wanna get weird?

04:40.080 --> 04:42.450
* I don't want to play

04:42.550 --> 04:43.617
Normal.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.486
Oh, yeah, I was gonna offer you
some dry ice.

04:45.586 --> 04:48.288
Oh, weird then.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.658
Dad,
I need your help.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.526
I think this Lars guy
might be a threat.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.694
"Might be"?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.529
Ray, I'm thinking of leaving
your mother for Lars.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.664
I have a bag packed.

04:56.764 --> 04:57.798
Dad, I'm serious.

04:57.898 --> 04:58.999
What should I do?

04:59.099 --> 05:01.301
Be yourself. That's who she
fell for in the first place.

05:01.402 --> 05:04.037
Is that what you'd do?
Of course not.
That's for suckers.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.506
So, tell me what you'd do.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.676
This conversation is over.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.310
What

05:10.411 --> 05:11.379
Because you have
no game?

05:11.479 --> 05:14.247
Because I have
too much game.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.884
You think your mother's
the first girl I've gotten
who was out of my league?

05:16.984 --> 05:19.353
So, teach me.
Give me some helpful tidbits.

05:19.453 --> 05:22.423
You can't handle my tidbits.
Let it go, Ray.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.259
Hey, Mom, did Dad have
any tricks

05:26.360 --> 05:27.861
to keep you interested
when you were dating?

05:27.961 --> 05:29.162
Ooh, did he ever.

05:29.262 --> 05:30.498
Oh. Do you wanna know
what they were?

05:30.598 --> 05:32.500
Think I can handle them?
Why not?

05:32.600 --> 05:33.534
I mean,
your dad used them.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.902
He's not
Gandalf the Grey.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.737
Okay.

05:36.837 --> 05:41.709
Well...no luck
on the scratchers.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.912
But this dry ice
is cool.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.614
Why can't they sell it
to kids, though?

05:46.714 --> 05:47.781
It's just ice.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.850
Ow!

05:49.950 --> 05:51.452
Where'd my fingerprints go?

05:51.552 --> 05:53.454
Hey, JJ.
What's going on?

05:53.554 --> 05:54.555
"Hi, Troy.

05:54.655 --> 05:57.625
Just E-N-- enjoying
some A-- adult stuff

05:57.725 --> 05:59.593
because I can."

05:59.693 --> 06:00.794
Your stuff looks cooler
than mine.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.063
I-I'm just getting some oil
for my car.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.432
I'm driving up north
this weekend.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.101
"Your stuff
sounds pretty cool."

06:08.201 --> 06:09.870
Not really. I'm gonna
spend a couple days

06:09.970 --> 06:11.138
with my girlfriend
in San Francisco,

06:11.238 --> 06:13.707
but then I got to look for
a job and an apartment.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.242
You know, get ready for Stanford
in the fall.

06:15.342 --> 06:19.246
"Wow.
You've got a lot going on."

06:19.346 --> 06:20.814
**

06:20.914 --> 06:23.984
Hey, uh, I heard they only have
one oil left.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.586
You -- You best
get going.

06:25.686 --> 06:28.922
Right. I-I'll be out quick,
but, JJ, you'll still be here?

06:29.022 --> 06:33.326
"I'm not going...anywhere."

06:33.427 --> 06:35.295
Great.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.131
Have fun
in college, Troy!

06:38.231 --> 06:40.501
Hope you learn
to shut up!

06:40.601 --> 06:41.969
Hey, Dylan.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.336
Nice job for
a first practice.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.939
You're a really
good wrestler.
Thanks.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.808
I'm new to this,
and I really like to win.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.810
Oh, yeah?
I really hate to lose.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.680
I guess
opposites attract.
Oh.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.915
Can I carry your bag?

06:55.015 --> 06:56.517
Sure.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.985
Can I carry yours?

06:59.319 --> 07:02.590
DiMeo, Revere, you're in
the same weight class.

07:02.690 --> 07:03.791
We only wrestle one
at that weight.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.326
You two will have to have
a wrestle-off tomorrow.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.096
BOTH: But what's gonna happen
when I beat you?

07:13.534 --> 07:16.937
JJ, there you are.
It's party time!

07:18.171 --> 07:20.140
"Do it and die."

07:23.511 --> 07:25.012
I need to take my fun
where I find it!

07:25.112 --> 07:27.180
He's here!

07:28.816 --> 07:31.785
Happy birthday, JJ.
Thanks for having us, man.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.522
Fun party.
"It is, huh?

07:34.622 --> 07:37.057
What did you do
for your E"

07:37.157 --> 07:38.358
Oh, it was awesome.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.561
Me and my cousin went to
this Indian casino.

07:40.661 --> 07:44.364
We partied like crazy,
and I won like 300 bucks.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.668
"Right. And was
your mom there?"

07:47.768 --> 07:49.670
No, but his was.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.574
Wait, mine?

07:53.674 --> 07:56.209
Solid smack.
Are you nuts?

07:56.810 --> 07:57.845
Hey, Mom.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.246
Oh, darling,
what's wrong?

07:59.346 --> 08:01.014
Did you ever have to wrestle
someone you loved

08:01.114 --> 08:02.816
because they weighed
the same amount as you?

08:02.916 --> 08:05.719
I like your problems, Dylan.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.589
RAY: I like a little
jalapeño kick in mine.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.658
It helps join
all the flavors.
Ray, come here.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.760
That's a nice jacket.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.828
It looks a lot like one
I keep in my closet.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.730
-Huh.
-Heard you mention jalapeño.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.566
You wouldn't be talking
about guacamole, would you?

08:18.666 --> 08:20.033
No. Why?

08:20.133 --> 08:21.535
Talking about guacamole
has a powerful,

08:21.635 --> 08:23.203
subconscious effect
on women.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.504
Why? Not sure.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.707
It's a social food.
Everybody likes it.

08:26.807 --> 08:27.875
It's exotic,
but not intimidating.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.042
It just works,

08:29.142 --> 08:31.211
which is why I put it
in my secret playbook --

08:31.311 --> 08:33.914
the one I told you
you're not ready for.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.616
I wasn't talking
about guacamole.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.585
Don't worry about it,
Chief.

08:37.685 --> 08:38.886
Oh, you're being
so weird.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.188
Well, I'm glad you met
a nice boy.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.756
And now I'm gonna
lose him.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.524
Ugh. I-I-I just wish
there was a way

08:44.625 --> 08:46.359
you could change
how much you weigh.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.262
Hold on.
No.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.964
You're not losing weight
for a boy.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.299
Lose?

08:52.399 --> 08:55.603
No, I don't lose at anything.
I'm gonna win weight.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.605
You gave Ray my secrets?

08:57.705 --> 08:59.406
Well, yeah.
No, he was worried about Lars,

08:59.506 --> 09:00.641
so I told him a few
of your silly moves

09:00.741 --> 09:02.209
from back in the day.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.612
Those "silly" moves landed me
the hottest girl

09:04.712 --> 09:06.947
in the East Village
when I was broke and unemployed.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.617
You thought I was the hottest
girl in the East Village?

09:09.717 --> 09:11.218
Yes.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.421
Ah.
He's got his hand on him?

09:14.521 --> 09:15.723
It is way too early
for that.

09:15.823 --> 09:16.790
That's phase two!

09:16.890 --> 09:18.792
Now, what is that move?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.127
It's a sophisticated
dominance technique

09:20.227 --> 09:21.629
based on canine
mating dynamics.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.597
I fell for dog moves?

09:23.697 --> 09:25.432
It's all too soon.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.000
He's going through the moves
too quickly.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.002
Again with the guacamole.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.939
Guacamole?
Where?

09:32.039 --> 09:34.675
Oh, now he's giving a girl
directions to the party,

09:34.775 --> 09:36.176
and it's making
Taylor jealous.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.478
You taught him
"Kimberly's Lost"?!

09:40.380 --> 09:45.085
* Happy birthday to you

09:45.185 --> 09:46.620
Whoo!

09:47.621 --> 09:50.123
Did you make
a wish, buddy?

09:50.223 --> 09:53.260
"For this party
to be over."

09:54.094 --> 09:57.430
I-I think JJ's been feeling like
18 for other people

09:57.530 --> 09:59.700
is different
from 18 for him.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.469
Kenneth, JJ hates it when
other people speak for him.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.137
Like I just did.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.806
Here, darling. Come on.
Have the first piece.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.375
JJ's not really feeling
the party right now.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.477
Oh. I wasn't really feeling
the party 18 years ago.

10:10.577 --> 10:11.979
Still pushed.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.114
"I'm leaving."

10:14.214 --> 10:15.515
W No.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.818
Your mom went to a lot of
trouble to give you this party.

10:17.918 --> 10:21.989
"Sorry. I F-O-- forgot
it's all about Mom."

10:22.089 --> 10:24.658
Hey, that's not fair.
Apologize.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.160
KENNETH:
"You can't make me.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.528
I'm an adult, right?"

10:28.628 --> 10:31.064
Yes, but as long as you are
living under our roof --

10:31.164 --> 10:34.334
"When will I not live
under your roof?"

10:34.434 --> 10:36.704
**

10:38.005 --> 10:39.139
JJ!

10:40.774 --> 10:43.510
No, no, no, no, no!
Find your own calories!

10:43.610 --> 10:44.878
Get! Get!

10:44.978 --> 10:46.914
All right, everyone,
moment's over.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.482
Let's get back to the party.
Everyone dance.

10:49.582 --> 10:50.684
There's no music.

10:50.784 --> 10:51.885
That's strike number two,

10:51.985 --> 10:53.721
Mr. My Mom was at
your Birthday Party.

10:53.821 --> 10:54.988
Dance!

10:58.091 --> 11:00.393
**

11:00.493 --> 11:01.494
GIRL: Oh, Ray.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.396
RAY: And she's been
giving me pointers

11:03.496 --> 11:05.232
since eighth-grade algebra.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.700
JIMMY: Ray,
we need to talk.

11:06.800 --> 11:10.203
What are you doing?
Who's that other girl?

11:10.303 --> 11:12.906
Oh, that's Kimberly.
She found the party.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.875
There's not supposed to be
a real Kimberly.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.778
Maybe in your day.
Ya boy is changing the game.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.446
No. You need to crawl
before you can walk.

11:19.546 --> 11:23.216
I am putting my foot down.
No more games of seduction.

11:23.316 --> 11:26.419
I'm better at this than you
ever were, and it's killing you.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.088
That's what this
is all about.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.291
That's such a strange read
of the situation.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.193
Wish me luck.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.128
Where you going?
I gained three pounds.

11:35.228 --> 11:38.766
I'm off to wrestling practice
to not humiliate the boy I like.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.267
They have wrestling practice
on a Saturday?

11:40.367 --> 11:43.103
That's what I'm focused on?

11:43.203 --> 11:44.304
JJ, enough already.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.439
Come out this instant.
Oh.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.876
I was all ready to bark at him,
but you'll do.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.278
What shall it be about?
I take requests.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.946
JJ's gone.
What

11:53.046 --> 11:55.082
That accessible-ride
service.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.917
He set up a pickup,
they came.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.753
That fast?
What an amazing resource.

12:01.154 --> 12:04.324
Maya.
What are you doing?

12:04.424 --> 12:05.826
I'm doing
the hard thing.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.761
He's an adult.
He deserves this.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.296
I'm not following him.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.764
Then why are you
getting your things?

12:10.864 --> 12:12.766
Well, I don't believe I am.
Oh.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.468
Okay, clearly my brain knows
what I should do,

12:15.568 --> 12:17.104
but my body is taking
a minute to catch up.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.572
Now, block my path and brace
yourself. I'm very scrappy.

12:19.672 --> 12:20.974
What?
Maya, stop!

12:21.074 --> 12:23.343
JJ, I'm coming over him!

12:24.077 --> 12:26.113
Oh!
No biting, lady.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.284
Let him do his thing.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.986
But you're good
to that kid.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.855
You deserve better.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.958
I just hope he doesn't do
something stupid.

12:38.058 --> 12:41.261
And last thing --
your age.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.097
**

12:44.197 --> 12:45.933
Yep, you're 18.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.604
You're up three pounds,
Rev.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.674
What?
You gained weight?

12:54.774 --> 12:57.144
I gained weight so I wouldn't
have to wrestle you.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.278
But that's what I did.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.047
Well, you're both in
the same new class.

13:00.147 --> 13:03.016
You're gonna have to wrestle-off
to see who wins that spot.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.484
No.
W

13:04.584 --> 13:06.887
There's clearly a spark
between you two.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.555
But, Dylan, if you beat Rev
in front of the whole team,

13:08.655 --> 13:11.524
he'll be too humiliated
to date you.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.027
But would you throw the match
for a chance at love?

13:14.127 --> 13:17.330
Wow. That's exactly
what's going on.

13:17.430 --> 13:21.368
I love all wrestling -- whether
it's with a person or a dilemma.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.905
Isn't Kimberly awesome,
Taylor?

13:25.005 --> 13:26.173
Mm. She is.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.241
I'm surprised you've never
mentioned her before.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.677
Oh, Ray, you got a little
something in your hair.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.045
I pick the leaves
out of Ray's hair.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.180
Could you please
put it back?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.481
Ladies, please.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.383
There's plenty of stuff
to pick out of my hair.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.851
I'm gonna go get a drink.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.053
I am also
to get drink.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.056
Would you also
to get me one?

13:46.193 --> 13:48.061
Thank you so much for coming
on such short notice.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.396
I'll do your homework
for a month.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.065
I'd be having fun even
if you didn't offer that.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.700
Do you really think
I'm awesome?

13:53.800 --> 13:56.870
Well, obviously it's all part of
the act, but you seem nice.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.875
JJ!

14:03.143 --> 14:05.078
"How did you find me?"

14:05.178 --> 14:08.548
You just had to go to the one
place your mom told you not to.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.618
Look, I don't pretend to know
what it is to be you,

14:11.718 --> 14:14.054
but you didn't have to treat
your mom like that.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.589
Maybe you didn't realize
how harsh you came across.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.227
"No, I did."

14:22.062 --> 14:24.597
"My friend here
likes to talk.

14:24.697 --> 14:28.068
You should start
on my P-A-- panther."

14:28.168 --> 14:30.403
Hold up.

14:32.539 --> 14:36.443
You know, just because
you use a wheelchair

14:36.543 --> 14:38.545
doesn't mean you can't
still be a jerk.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.948
You want to stop
feeling like a child?

14:41.048 --> 14:43.383
Stop acting like one.

14:46.219 --> 14:50.490
So...you gonna do this?

14:50.590 --> 14:54.227
I could do a panther
that says "I'm sorry."

15:00.467 --> 15:02.970
Guys, I need help
with Taylor.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.137
No more moves.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.505
Taylor went home.
Just call it a night.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.807
But playing it cool
actually is a move.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.442
I liked it when you
played that one.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.278
No, forget moves.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.645
The others worked
too well.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.181
My Kimberly kissed me.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.748
-No!

15:15.848 --> 15:17.317
I didn't kiss her back,
but what do I do?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.419
Do I tell Taylor?
-No!

15:19.519 --> 15:20.520
You shouldn't even
have told us.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.489
I disagree.
He didn't mean for it to happen.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.191
This is why I didn't
want you playing games,

15:24.291 --> 15:25.458
because you have to
get your hands dirty,

15:25.558 --> 15:27.995
and you're way too good
of a person to do that.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.629
Now you need to stay the course.
Don't tell her.

15:29.729 --> 15:32.032
He is a good person,
so he'll tell the truth,

15:32.132 --> 15:33.133
and Taylor
will understand.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.934
You're right. There's no
downside to the truth.

15:35.035 --> 15:38.105
-Yeah.
-No downside. Huh.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.208
Uh, the things I do
for you, Ray.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.112
Do you remember when
we first started dating

15:45.212 --> 15:46.313
and you were over
at my apartment

15:46.413 --> 15:48.681
and I took a call
from a girl named "Ruby"?

15:48.781 --> 15:51.018
-Oh, yeah, your cousin.
-I don't have a cousin Ruby.

15:51.118 --> 15:54.621
That was a girl I was dating
before you and I were exclusive.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.623
What?

15:56.723 --> 15:58.791
You...

15:58.891 --> 16:00.060
Bedroom, now.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.395
I'm confused.
Is this good or bad?

16:02.495 --> 16:04.031
-Bad!
-Bad.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.198
Lesson learned.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.034
You're a good father.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.670
Earn this.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.008
I can see you're conflicted,
but don't be, okay?

16:15.108 --> 16:17.144
I'm really good.
First, I'll just take you down.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.813
Right.
Like that.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.217
If I were
to let you win,

16:24.317 --> 16:26.053
where would you take me
on our first date?

16:26.153 --> 16:27.320
Pizza?

16:27.420 --> 16:29.989
Uh, s-steak! Steak!

16:31.191 --> 16:33.726
Somewhere really fancy
with lots of forks.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.762
Too many -- like five.
-Okay.

16:35.862 --> 16:40.033
I wouldn't do this for just
anyone, so...treat me right.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.601
Make it worth it.

16:41.701 --> 16:42.569
Deal.

16:43.836 --> 16:47.374
**

16:47.474 --> 16:49.609
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm not feeling this.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.447
Winner -- DiMeo!

16:57.150 --> 16:58.051
I'm sorry.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.053
I couldn't do it.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.854
I guess this is goodbye.

17:02.622 --> 17:07.794
**

17:07.927 --> 17:09.929
That was my first kiss.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.564
That was my first loss.

17:11.664 --> 17:12.532
I didn't mind it.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.234
Yeah. Me, neither.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.070
Compromise and
say burgers?

17:17.170 --> 17:19.939
-Yeah.
-Get off the mat!

17:21.241 --> 17:22.775
MAN:
...while the male gorilla

17:22.875 --> 17:24.944
emerges from the brush
searching for food...

17:25.044 --> 17:27.747
Ray, can I be honest with you
about something?

17:27.847 --> 17:30.083
When you were talking
with that girl earlier today,

17:30.183 --> 17:31.918
it made me
kind of jealous.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.987
Taylor, you've got nothing
to be jealous about --

17:35.088 --> 17:36.889
believe me.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.225
And you being honest
with me

17:38.325 --> 17:40.827
makes me want to be honest
with you.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.295
So...

17:44.931 --> 17:46.466
...I will,
if it ever comes up.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.840
Okay, there is something
I need to tell you about.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.644
I got freaked out by Lars,
so I invited Kimberly.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.312
I wanted you
to be jealous.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.349
Ray!
Not cool.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.916
But kind of flattering.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.853
And I appreciate
the honesty.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.955
See, I knew
you'd understand.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.290
And no more games.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.925
She got the wrong idea
and she kissed me.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.761
What?

18:14.861 --> 18:16.796
No, I didn't
kiss her back.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.132
See, this is honesty.
It's good.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.933
Hit me cutely again.
You let her kiss you?

18:21.033 --> 18:22.969
I didn't let her.
She just did it.

18:23.069 --> 18:26.173
There's nothing you can do
when someone just kisses you.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.143
Okay, see,
next time I'll do that.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.145
You kissed someone else?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.982
You need to go.

18:37.484 --> 18:40.119
And come back in a couple
of minutes or...

18:40.220 --> 18:41.521
Or never.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.890
**

18:49.329 --> 18:51.798
God, that works
so well.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.466
MAN: Now, let's get you over
to Lori for the traffic.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.168
How's it looking out there
on our freeways?

18:58.238 --> 19:02.475
Your adult son has a statement
he's asked me to read.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.979
"I want to apologize for leaving
and for all I said.

19:07.079 --> 19:11.150
It was rude, ungrateful,
and childish.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.519
I'm sorry.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.187
Thanks for all
you did today

19:14.287 --> 19:17.089
and all you've done
my first 18 years."

19:19.392 --> 19:20.893
Is that
a bloody tattoo?

19:20.993 --> 19:22.662
"Yes, Mom, it is
a bloody tattoo."

19:22.762 --> 19:24.163
Good guess
on the timing.

19:24.264 --> 19:27.767
"At first I wanted to get one
to lash out at you.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.269
That's dumb.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.605
But I did want to mark
my 18th birthday."

19:34.941 --> 19:36.376
JIMMY:
Fudgie the Whale.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.077
I don't hate it.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.247
But before I turn on it,

19:40.347 --> 19:42.181
do you want us to show you
your present?

19:43.783 --> 19:45.051
Ta-da!

19:47.287 --> 19:50.523
"I know we have
a G-A-- garage."

19:50.623 --> 19:52.392
We had a garage.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.761
You are a man.
This is your cave.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.729
JIMMY:
You deserve a space.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.765
This is a nearby,
but different, roof.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.967
We still have to clean it out,
but we will.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.102
And we brought in
some of your grown-up things.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.438
So you can kick back
with your knife and,

20:05.538 --> 20:07.640
for some reason,
cold medicine.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.442
So, what do you think?

20:09.542 --> 20:12.044
**

20:12.144 --> 20:15.081
"I just have one
Q-U-- question."

20:15.181 --> 20:16.249
Anything, darling.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.952
"What are you still doing
in my C"

20:20.052 --> 20:22.622
He loves it.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.157
Happy birthday, buddy.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.929
How will we know when
we're meant to come back?

20:33.966 --> 20:37.169
Well, it turns out, Ruby,
that while we were going out,

20:37.270 --> 20:40.006
I was actually in an exclusive
relationship with my girlfriend,

20:40.106 --> 20:42.575
and that girlfriend
is now my wife,

20:42.675 --> 20:45.144
and she would like you to know
that I am off the market...

20:45.244 --> 20:47.780
20 years.
...and have been
for 20 years.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.816
My marriage
is going great.

20:49.916 --> 20:53.085
Thank you.
Classic Ruby.

20:53.185 --> 20:56.022
I still don't get how you didn't
realize that we were exclusive.

20:56.122 --> 20:59.692
I mean, it makes a person wonder
what else needs to be named.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.161
Okay. We are not in
an open marriage.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.630
No flirting.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.332
Except to get out
of tickets.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.700
No friending high-school exes
on social media.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.469
Yeah.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.338
Yeah, yep, yep, yep.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.306
I just -- I have to check
my computer

21:13.406 --> 21:14.474
for something unrelated.

21:14.574 --> 21:15.675
Are you kidding me?!

21:15.775 --> 21:18.811
**

21:18.911 --> 21:21.448
I make awesome guacamole.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.552
It just works.
I don't -- It's --
