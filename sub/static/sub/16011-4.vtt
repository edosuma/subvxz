[whispering] Vincent!

02:05.520 --> 02:06.640
What's happening?

02:06.680 --> 02:08.160
You're gonna love this.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.440
[Vincent] Wow.

02:15.480 --> 02:16.840
I mean, seriously.

02:16.880 --> 02:17.920
Whoa.

02:19.680 --> 02:20.880
Okay, I have approximately

02:20.881 --> 02:22.080
two thousand questions

02:22.120 --> 02:23.200
about this.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.640
Only two thousand?

02:26.320 --> 02:27.560
Question one:

02:27.600 --> 02:29.120
how do you not totally freak out

02:29.160 --> 02:30.720
every time that happens?

02:30.760 --> 02:32.560
Believe me, I do.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.900
[Vincent] Good. Because...

02:33.901 --> 02:35.200
I mean... Whoa.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.980
Question two, is it... is it

02:36.981 --> 02:38.720
some kind of chemical reaction,

02:41.640 --> 02:43.280
or is it just...

02:43.320 --> 02:46.160
Well well well!

02:46.200 --> 02:48.160
- Well well...
- [squawks]

02:48.200 --> 02:49.760
- Right, you already
- said that. Okay.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.020
Um. Violetta, do you mind,

02:51.021 --> 02:52.240
we're studying.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.300
Mia, I think you and I got off

02:54.301 --> 02:56.320
on the wrong foot.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.680
Which is good,

02:57.681 --> 02:59.000
because I don't like you.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.600
And I don't want you anywhere

03:00.601 --> 03:02.160
near my right foot.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.320
- She doesn't like you.

03:03.321 --> 03:04.440
- [squawks]

03:04.480 --> 03:05.920
I'm really not interested

03:05.921 --> 03:07.360
in your feet. Either of them.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.760
I knew right from the start

03:08.761 --> 03:10.120
that you don't fit in here.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.480
But even I didn't realize

03:11.481 --> 03:12.800
just how much.

03:12.840 --> 03:14.520
- You don't fit in.
- Stop it.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.560
Sorry, okay.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.220
Everywhere you go,

03:19.221 --> 03:20.840
you've got this silly book.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.440
Every time I see you,

03:22.441 --> 03:24.000
you're looking at it.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.200
My... "friend", Paula,

03:27.240 --> 03:28.640
tells me that even at night,

03:28.680 --> 03:30.280
- you never let it
- out of your sight.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.640
- Can I see?
- Hey, hey!

03:43.520 --> 03:45.740
[laughs] Wow, this book

03:45.741 --> 03:47.960
is even sillier than I thought.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.920
Fairy tales?! Really?

03:51.960 --> 03:53.760
This is it?

03:53.800 --> 03:56.240
[mockingly] Unicorns and elves?

03:56.280 --> 03:58.080
- That's the book
- you're so obsessed with?

03:59.840 --> 04:01.120
[laughs] You're a bigger loser

04:01.121 --> 04:02.400
than I thought!

04:02.440 --> 04:03.720
[girls laugh]

04:05.920 --> 04:07.760
@Oh and look,

04:07.800 --> 04:09.220
@fuzzy little goat men

04:09.221 --> 04:10.640
with flutes!

04:10.680 --> 04:12.480
- Pans.
- It's really all very nerdy.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.880
@I'm a nerd. Big time.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.339
Finally we agree on something.

04:16.341 --> 04:17.760
[chuckles]

04:17.800 --> 04:20.040
Psss! Give that back!

04:20.079 --> 04:21.560
- Stay away from those pages.
- Okay?

04:21.600 --> 04:23.200
[whispers] Vincent!

04:23.240 --> 04:24.680
What's on those pages?

04:24.720 --> 04:25.960
He doodles in there.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.400
He doesn't want you to see it.

04:36.840 --> 04:37.940
- That was close.

04:37.941 --> 04:39.040
- Close?

04:39.080 --> 04:40.960
- Do you have any idea
- what you just did?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.256
- She thought it was nothing
- but a stupid book of fairy tales

04:43.280 --> 04:44.480
- until you jumped in.

04:44.481 --> 04:45.681
- She was gonna see the runes,

04:45.720 --> 04:47.616
- and the pictures in the back!
- She wouldn't know

04:47.640 --> 04:49.880
- What they mean. Now she knows
- they're important.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.936
- She's never gonna stop.
- And what would have happened

04:51.960 --> 04:54.080
- If she figured out
- it was you in those pictures?

04:54.120 --> 04:55.200
Well, I just hope

04:55.201 --> 04:56.280
she doesn't believe you.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.320
If she finds out

04:57.321 --> 04:58.336
what the book really is...

04:58.360 --> 04:59.920
I don't even know

04:59.921 --> 05:01.480
what that book really is!

05:01.520 --> 05:02.800
Okay, maybe I should

05:02.801 --> 05:04.080
just go read these new runes

05:04.120 --> 05:05.480
by myself somewhere.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.760
I had no choice.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.240
You know that, right?

05:32.440 --> 05:34.440
@Uh oh, this can't be right.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.240
I don't like the sound of this.

05:50.560 --> 05:51.920
Hi Mia.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.920
Say your password.

05:53.960 --> 05:56.600
"One who scowls without a face,

05:56.640 --> 05:58.840
scatters hope without a trace."

06:09.640 --> 06:11.560
[screams]

06:14.360 --> 06:15.600
[grunts]

06:15.640 --> 06:17.120
Ow!

06:17.160 --> 06:19.160
- Okay,
- that was harder than usual.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.620
And this is

06:23.621 --> 06:25.200
a lot scarier than usual.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.380
Lyria must be around here

06:26.381 --> 06:27.520
somewhere!

06:27.560 --> 06:29.280
[neighing]

06:29.320 --> 06:30.720
Lyria!

06:30.760 --> 06:32.160
Oh no!

06:34.320 --> 06:35.800
[hissing]

06:38.400 --> 06:40.160
Lyria, there's another!

06:42.280 --> 06:43.640
[shrieks]

06:43.680 --> 06:44.760
[neighs]

06:47.920 --> 06:49.840
[growling]

06:49.880 --> 06:51.440
Leave her alone!

06:52.520 --> 06:55.640
Ohh! AAAAAAH!

06:57.840 --> 06:58.920
Ugh!

07:04.080 --> 07:05.200
Lyria?!

07:14.360 --> 07:15.720
Lyria?

07:16.480 --> 07:17.760
Yikes.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.400
[coughs]

07:19.440 --> 07:21.440
Now that's a stink.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.200
LYRIA?!

07:24.680 --> 07:26.400
- Please tell me
- you guys are nearby.

07:26.440 --> 07:27.600
DING!

07:30.200 --> 07:32.400
Not a good time right now, Mia!

07:34.360 --> 07:36.320
[neighing]

07:38.600 --> 07:39.880
Ugh! Yah!

07:39.920 --> 07:41.080
[laughs victoriously]

07:44.120 --> 07:45.400
[dragon shrieks]

07:47.040 --> 07:48.400
[shoots water]

07:48.401 --> 07:49.760
FSSHHH!

07:50.720 --> 07:52.040
FSSSSHH!

07:53.320 --> 07:56.000
Whoa, that's not a good look!

07:56.840 --> 07:58.320
FFFSSHHH!

07:58.360 --> 08:00.040
Try to land on

08:00.041 --> 08:01.720
your little teeny feet!

08:01.760 --> 08:03.580
[laughs] That pathetic elf girl

08:03.581 --> 08:05.400
is all alone!

08:05.440 --> 08:07.120
We can take her!

08:13.160 --> 08:14.280
[hissing]

08:14.320 --> 08:15.480
[gasps]

08:20.320 --> 08:22.120
[grunts with effort]

08:22.160 --> 08:24.400
BLUUUUUUUUURPP!

08:27.080 --> 08:29.880
It's about time, Mr. Slowpoke!

08:29.920 --> 08:32.159
BLUUUUUUUURP!

08:34.559 --> 08:36.440
Did I say retreat!?

08:36.480 --> 08:38.120
I don't think so!

08:38.159 --> 08:39.679
[breaths in]

08:39.720 --> 08:42.159
BLUUUUUUUUUUURP!

08:42.200 --> 08:43.840
[screams]

08:43.880 --> 08:46.400
Re-re-re-treeeat!

08:46.440 --> 08:47.500
You'll never be a match

08:47.501 --> 08:48.560
for the Trumptus!

08:48.600 --> 08:49.640
[tinkling]

08:49.680 --> 08:51.000
Mia's here!

08:51.040 --> 08:53.080
I know! Mia.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.080
[Mo] Let's go!

09:02.400 --> 09:04.520
- [Mia] I'm getting pretty sick
- of this fog.

09:05.640 --> 09:06.760
[coughs]

09:06.800 --> 09:08.680
I gotta get out of here.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.720
[coughs]

09:15.600 --> 09:16.600
Ohhhhh no...

09:16.601 --> 09:17.601
[hits ground]

09:23.560 --> 09:25.840
[Panthea] AGAIN?!

09:25.880 --> 09:27.240
I haven't had

09:27.241 --> 09:28.600
a fresh unicorn horn in days,

09:28.640 --> 09:29.860
and again

09:29.861 --> 09:31.080
you blame it on some...

09:31.120 --> 09:32.360
flute?

09:32.400 --> 09:34.880
Trombone? Uuh.. Tuba?

09:34.920 --> 09:36.120
Trumptus ma'am.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.000
It's actually called a trumptus.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.540
Ugh, you're just

09:39.541 --> 09:41.040
making up words now!

09:41.080 --> 09:42.780
I'm sick of hearing

09:42.781 --> 09:44.480
about that ridiculous toy!

09:44.520 --> 09:46.520
This is your fault!

09:46.560 --> 09:48.120
But my queen,

09:48.160 --> 09:49.480
the Trumptus

09:49.481 --> 09:50.800
isn't like a water glare.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.360
[screams]

09:52.400 --> 09:54.200
A water glare's effect

09:54.201 --> 09:56.000
is temporary.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.380
The effect of the trumptus

09:57.381 --> 09:58.720
is permanent!

09:58.760 --> 10:00.400
We're running out of warriors!

10:00.440 --> 10:02.200
Enough excuses!

10:02.240 --> 10:03.420
If this "Trump-horn"

10:03.421 --> 10:04.600
or whatever you call it,

10:04.640 --> 10:06.000
is such a problem,

10:06.040 --> 10:08.320
then take it from them!

10:08.360 --> 10:10.720
- If I can't rely on you
- for something as simple as that,

10:10.760 --> 10:12.300
Then I may have to

10:12.301 --> 10:13.840
re-consider your position

10:13.880 --> 10:15.560
in my ranks.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.580
Of course, my queen!

10:17.581 --> 10:19.560
Anything you say.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.680
- [muttering] You shrivelled up
- old hag.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.880
What did you say?

10:23.920 --> 10:25.420
Oh, uh, I don't know; ugh...

10:25.421 --> 10:26.920
[chuckles nervously]

10:26.960 --> 10:28.560
I wasn't listening to me.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.080
I should go!

10:36.280 --> 10:37.520
[coughs]

10:40.280 --> 10:41.440
Lyria?

10:41.480 --> 10:43.000
You came after me?

10:43.040 --> 10:44.400
[neighs]

10:44.440 --> 10:45.800
You shouldn't have done that!

10:47.240 --> 10:48.560
- [coughs]

10:48.561 --> 10:49.880
- [neighs]

10:49.920 --> 10:52.040
I see it! I see the way out!

10:53.760 --> 10:55.080
Stop!!

10:59.400 --> 11:00.640
[growls]

11:00.680 --> 11:01.720
[gasps]

11:05.120 --> 11:06.400

11:14.920 --> 11:16.040
RAHH!

11:17.960 --> 11:19.080
[growls]

11:19.800 --> 11:20.840
[sniffs]

11:26.680 --> 11:27.960
- [shrieks]

11:27.961 --> 11:29.240
- [screams]

11:29.280 --> 11:30.440
SPLASH! SPLASH!

11:32.520 --> 11:33.600
SPLASH!

11:35.680 --> 11:36.800
- Mo!

11:36.801 --> 11:37.920
- Mmmm...

11:39.080 --> 11:40.200
[neighs]

11:40.920 --> 11:41.960
[gasps]

11:43.560 --> 11:44.680
[growls]

11:47.080 --> 11:48.760
- FFSSHHH!
- SPLASH!

11:52.680 --> 11:56.120
ARGH! ARGH! ARGH!

11:56.160 --> 11:58.560
[gasps] Woah! Woa!

12:03.120 --> 12:04.440
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

12:04.480 --> 12:05.520
[gasp]

12:05.560 --> 12:06.960
[cough]

12:07.000 --> 12:08.680

12:08.720 --> 12:09.760

12:09.800 --> 12:11.040
[coughs and gasps]

12:11.760 --> 12:12.800

12:12.840 --> 12:14.400
FSSHHH! FSHHH!

12:18.520 --> 12:19.760
[shrieks]

12:19.800 --> 12:21.240
Let's get out of here, Lyria!

12:21.280 --> 12:22.920
[coughing]

12:25.280 --> 12:26.320
Pheew...

12:27.520 --> 12:29.240
[deep brreathe in] Aaaah...

12:40.760 --> 12:41.840
[let out breath]

12:41.880 --> 12:43.360
Nice place to land.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.120
- Next time why don't you
- just show up

12:45.160 --> 12:46.800
In a nest of scorpions?

12:46.840 --> 12:48.840
It's not like I had any choice.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.440
This is where Lyria was.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.640
Ah!

12:52.680 --> 12:53.840
OH!

12:53.880 --> 12:55.240
My head is still spinning

12:55.280 --> 12:57.160
from that horrible fog.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.440
One whiff of that stuff

12:58.480 --> 12:59.680
and you get so dizzy

12:59.720 --> 13:01.320
you lose all sense of direction,

13:01.360 --> 13:03.160
can't fly, can't water glare,

13:03.200 --> 13:04.640
can barely even walk.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.240
Well I'll tell you this...

13:06.280 --> 13:07.480
[distant noises]

13:09.200 --> 13:11.520
- [Mia] (ECHOED) I am never going
- back there again.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.880
- [Mo] "One who scowls
- without a face",

13:17.920 --> 13:19.520
That can only mean Panthea.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.200
[Mia] Panthea has no face?

13:21.240 --> 13:22.920
Well, she probably does.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.520
But nobody's ever seen it.

13:24.560 --> 13:25.800
Correction...

13:25.840 --> 13:27.960
nobody's ever seen it and lived.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.560
That bad, huh?

13:29.600 --> 13:31.520
- What about
- "scatters hope without a trace"?

13:31.560 --> 13:32.620
That I don't know.

13:32.621 --> 13:33.680
But it doesn't sound good.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.336
- When the oracle
- mentioned "hope" before,

13:35.360 --> 13:37.160
- It was talking
- about the Trumptus.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.400
Yeah, but there's no way

13:38.401 --> 13:39.600
she's doing any scattering

13:39.640 --> 13:41.160
with that while I'm carrying it.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.920
I never let it out of my...

13:42.960 --> 13:44.040
[gasps]

13:46.120 --> 13:47.640
Yuko, do you have the Trumptus?

13:47.680 --> 13:48.960
Nope!

13:50.000 --> 13:51.760
Wait a minute...

13:51.800 --> 13:53.520
you don't either?

13:53.560 --> 13:54.640
You don't!

13:54.680 --> 13:56.160
I... I thought I did.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.920
HUH! Where is it?

13:57.960 --> 13:59.060
Just think,

13:59.061 --> 14:00.160
when did you have it last?

14:00.200 --> 14:01.320
We used it

14:01.321 --> 14:02.441
to drive off those Munculus.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.000
I'm pretty sure I still had it

14:04.001 --> 14:05.520
when we left there to find you.

14:05.560 --> 14:06.720
So you must have dropped it

14:06.721 --> 14:07.880
somewhere. Maybe in th...

14:07.920 --> 14:09.360
[gasps]

14:09.400 --> 14:11.280
Oh no.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.840
Come on! We have to go back!

14:13.880 --> 14:14.920
Wait for me!

14:14.960 --> 14:16.160
[Lyria snorts]

14:16.200 --> 14:18.160
Sorry Lyria, you can't come.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.260
Find a safe spot to hide

14:19.261 --> 14:20.320
until we get back.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.340
[Mo] We better keep an eye out

14:28.341 --> 14:29.760
for Munculus.

14:29.800 --> 14:30.800
[Yuko] The vapors

14:30.801 --> 14:31.801
are like candy to them

14:31.840 --> 14:33.680
but poison to elves.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.260
I'll go.

14:36.261 --> 14:37.560
It's my responsibility.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.680
No no no!

14:38.681 --> 14:39.760
You're not going in there!

14:39.800 --> 14:40.800
The Elfdom

14:40.801 --> 14:41.801
needs its prince alive.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.320
- I'll go.
- Forget it!

14:43.360 --> 14:44.880
I'm not letting you go in there!

14:44.920 --> 14:46.480
I'm faster than you are!

14:46.520 --> 14:47.920
Also tougher, smarter, taller,

14:47.960 --> 14:49.400
better fighter, better flyer,

14:49.440 --> 14:50.440
better Water Glarer,

14:50.441 --> 14:51.441
more stylish...

14:51.480 --> 14:53.120
- Taller?
- Sure I am.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.120
- That's just dumb!
- Hello down there.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.700
- Oh ya!?

14:56.701 --> 14:58.240
- [Mia] Guys! I'll go.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.420
I mean, I already know I can

14:59.421 --> 15:00.560
handle the fog for a while.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.840
Maybe the fog

15:01.841 --> 15:03.080
doesn't affect me the same.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.600
Alright, we'll fly above you

15:04.601 --> 15:06.080
and keep an eye out for trouble.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.800
[coughs]

15:20.800 --> 15:22.200
- Mo?

15:22.201 --> 15:23.600
- Straight ahead and left!

15:23.640 --> 15:24.880
Let's hurry this up.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.400
When we get the Trumptus back,

15:26.440 --> 15:28.160
- we won't have anything
- to worry about.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.520
Any sign of Munculus?

15:31.560 --> 15:32.720
All clear!

15:35.120 --> 15:37.120
Looks like it's

15:37.121 --> 15:39.120
Gargona's lucky day after all.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.740
[laughs] This is gonna be like

15:41.741 --> 15:44.320
taking candy from a baby!

15:49.680 --> 15:51.040
I can't take much more!

15:51.080 --> 15:52.880
[Yuko] Mia, this is the place!

15:52.920 --> 15:54.760
That's right! [coughs]

15:56.080 --> 15:58.360
It's gotta be right here.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.200
There! Mo, I see it!

16:01.240 --> 16:03.060
- She sees it!

16:03.061 --> 16:04.880
- Woohooo! [chuckles]

16:04.920 --> 16:06.920
- [Yuko] We did it, we did it,
- we...

16:06.960 --> 16:08.400
- Oh no!
- Yuko!

16:08.440 --> 16:09.640
[Yuko] Woooo...

16:11.160 --> 16:12.200
[grunts]

16:14.480 --> 16:15.600
[exhales]

16:17.960 --> 16:19.000
[dragon shrieks]

16:19.040 --> 16:20.080
[grunts]

16:22.880 --> 16:24.680
Mo! Not in the Vapors!

16:24.720 --> 16:25.960
[inhales deeply]

16:26.720 --> 16:27.800
[coughs]

16:29.160 --> 16:31.560
[laughs maniacally]

16:34.280 --> 16:35.320
[grunts]

16:35.360 --> 16:36.480
[coughs]

16:39.720 --> 16:42.960
[coughs] Mia... the Trumptus!

16:44.360 --> 16:46.480
[coughs]

16:46.520 --> 16:47.960
[Gargona] Haha!

16:48.000 --> 16:50.640
You elves are so much more fun

16:50.680 --> 16:52.360
when you're helpless.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.240
You and I have met before.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.560
As I recall,

16:55.561 --> 16:56.840
you don't fight back.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.240
[coughs]

17:01.280 --> 17:03.520
The vapors getting to you?

17:03.560 --> 17:05.520
Nasty, aren't they?

17:05.560 --> 17:07.079
[chuckling] To elves, anyway.

17:07.119 --> 17:08.599
But not to me.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.319
[breaths in deeply]

17:10.359 --> 17:13.880
I kind of find them refreshing.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.700
Three really annoying elves

17:16.701 --> 17:19.480
finally captured all at once.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.560
I call that a goooood day.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.400
But add that soon to be

17:24.401 --> 17:26.200
worthless piece of molten metal

17:26.240 --> 17:28.099
and this may just be

17:28.101 --> 17:29.960
the best day ever.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.280
You're...

17:31.320 --> 17:32.800
not... taking it!

17:32.801 --> 17:34.280
[coughs]

17:34.320 --> 17:36.380
Panthea is gonna be very pleased

17:36.381 --> 17:38.440
with me today!

17:38.480 --> 17:40.920
[laughs maniacally]

17:41.920 --> 17:44.000
[echoed laughter]

17:51.960 --> 17:53.000
[gasps]

17:57.320 --> 17:58.760
Sooo..

17:58.800 --> 18:00.420
This is the much

18:00.421 --> 18:02.040
talked about Trombonus.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.800
Trumptus, my queen.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.040
Strange that something

18:05.041 --> 18:06.240
so small and...

18:06.280 --> 18:07.800
shoddily made could cause

18:07.801 --> 18:09.320
so much trouble.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.600
You have done well,

18:10.601 --> 18:11.840
General Gargona.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.040
For once.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.080
Thank you, Queen Panthea.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.680
Now that this...

18:16.720 --> 18:17.960
"thing" is out of the way

18:18.000 --> 18:19.560
you should have no trouble

18:19.600 --> 18:21.760
finding me unicorn horns.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.360
Did you hear that, elves?

18:23.400 --> 18:26.000
You are defeated!

18:26.040 --> 18:27.060
- Ha ha ha!

18:27.061 --> 18:28.080
- [meows]

18:29.440 --> 18:31.440
The elf prince.

18:31.480 --> 18:34.200
And his warrior friend.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.960
You're shorter than I imagined.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.680
- And you're older
- than I imagined.

18:37.720 --> 18:39.060
- I am not.

18:39.061 --> 18:40.400
- You're really old.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.540
- Seriously old.

18:41.541 --> 18:42.640
- [Panthea] STOP IT!

18:42.680 --> 18:43.940
You're lucky I don't throw you

18:43.941 --> 18:45.200
to the dragons!

18:45.240 --> 18:46.400
- [hissing]

18:46.401 --> 18:47.560
- Meooowww...

18:47.600 --> 18:49.640
You I don't recognize.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.560
- Therefore
- you must be insignificant.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.880
- The elves will drive you
- out of Centopia.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.520
You don't stand a chance!

18:56.560 --> 18:58.240
Is that right?

18:58.280 --> 19:00.320
How are they going to do that?

19:00.360 --> 19:01.920
With this?

19:01.960 --> 19:03.540
This "Trumptus"

19:03.541 --> 19:05.120
clearly holds great power.

19:05.160 --> 19:06.340
And it will take great power

19:06.341 --> 19:07.520
to destroy it.

19:07.560 --> 19:10.520
But destroy it I shall!

19:10.560 --> 19:12.420
I will hurl it into

19:12.421 --> 19:14.280
the Fire Sands piece by piece!

19:14.320 --> 19:15.880
There, all the forces

19:15.881 --> 19:17.440
of the universe converge

19:17.480 --> 19:19.140
into a single molten vortex

19:19.141 --> 19:20.800
of chaos!

19:20.840 --> 19:22.840
Ha ha ha ha!

19:24.160 --> 19:25.800
But that's a lot of work.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.600
So let's go with Plan B.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.960
[elves] NOOOOO!

19:38.960 --> 19:40.520
Gargona, gather those up!

19:40.560 --> 19:42.560
And bring the prisoners!

19:44.680 --> 19:47.240
Munculus! Come to me!

19:47.280 --> 19:49.120
I have a task for you!

19:49.160 --> 19:50.840
I want you all to watch

19:50.841 --> 19:52.520
as your only hope disappears.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.600
Munculus! Take these,

19:59.640 --> 20:01.200
and spread them

20:01.201 --> 20:02.760
to the far corners of Centopia!

20:02.800 --> 20:04.880
Scatter them! Hide them!

20:04.920 --> 20:06.800
Lose them forever!

20:12.920 --> 20:14.800
- "...scatters hope
- without a trace."

20:15.840 --> 20:17.960
[laughs maniacally]

20:20.840 --> 20:21.880
[bites]

20:25.640 --> 20:26.720
[bites]

20:26.760 --> 20:28.160
I don't know what it is,

20:28.200 --> 20:30.440
but I just love winning.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.320
Don't you, elves?

20:32.360 --> 20:33.940
Oh that's right,

20:33.941 --> 20:35.520
you wouldn't know.

20:35.560 --> 20:36.980
Because you always lose!

20:36.981 --> 20:38.400
[laughs]

20:38.440 --> 20:42.160
[Gargona] HA HA HA!

20:42.200 --> 20:44.080
[hisses]

20:47.280 --> 20:49.160
- [bites]
- [screeches]

20:49.200 --> 20:50.880
Oh! Ugh!

20:54.480 --> 20:56.800
Gargona! Do something!

21:00.600 --> 21:01.700
- Ugh!

21:01.701 --> 21:02.800
- Ah!

21:02.840 --> 21:04.680
Munculi! Defend me!

21:14.200 --> 21:16.040
[Mia] Mo! Yuko!

21:16.080 --> 21:17.680
[laughs triumphantly]

21:17.720 --> 21:19.120
Get out of here!

21:19.160 --> 21:20.880
- We're not gonna
- leave you behind!

21:20.920 --> 21:22.060
Just go!

21:22.061 --> 21:23.200
I've got my own way out!

21:25.800 --> 21:27.260
[grunts] Come on, Mo!

21:27.261 --> 21:28.720
She'll be okay!

21:31.160 --> 21:32.720
[Panthea] HA!

21:32.760 --> 21:34.880
- You think
- I'll let you go that easy?!

21:34.920 --> 21:37.140
You are the most annoying elf

21:37.141 --> 21:39.360
I have ever encountered!

21:39.400 --> 21:40.800
Lady,

21:40.801 --> 21:42.200
you ain't seen nothin' yet.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.720
Gargona, this is YOUR fault!

21:49.760 --> 21:51.120
Told ya!

21:51.160 --> 21:52.240
[laughs]

21:56.560 --> 21:58.440
Oh no! No!

22:05.640 --> 22:07.080
Yuko, Mo,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.920
I'm so sorry!

22:19.240 --> 22:20.480
Vincent!

22:24.400 --> 22:25.840
What's wrong?

22:27.040 --> 22:28.480
Everybody messes up, right?

22:29.880 --> 22:31.360
Did something happen?

22:31.400 --> 22:32.720
You could say that.

22:32.760 --> 22:34.040
Do you want a drink?

22:34.080 --> 22:35.520
I have water, or...

22:35.560 --> 22:37.640
um... more water.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.520
Your choice.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.560
That'd be great.
