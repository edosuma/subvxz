Keeps you alert.

02:07.344 --> 02:10.173
You came to work after
last night

02:10.217 --> 02:13.176
Been asking myself the same
question for weeks, Sebastian.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.613
Sleep is for suckers.
I got too much to do.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.615
See you've been going
through my books again.

02:17.659 --> 02:20.488
Mm-hmm, somebody had to.
They're a mess.

02:20.531 --> 02:23.186
You know, I've been running
this place for three years.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.188
Somehow got by.
Yeah.

02:25.232 --> 02:28.060
But a 15% markup
on your liquor costs.

02:28.104 --> 02:30.062
That is not good business, D.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.195
That does sound like a lot.Mm. Now,

02:32.239 --> 02:35.285
I know a guy that can
bring these costs down.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.766
What kind of guy, Jimmy?

02:37.809 --> 02:39.246
A legit one.

02:39.289 --> 02:40.725
He comes into
the bakery.

02:40.769 --> 02:43.032
I told him about the Trutone.

02:43.075 --> 02:45.600
He wants
to pitch me his services.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.299
I know that look.
I've overstepped.

02:49.343 --> 02:50.518
Oh, brothers can't overstep.

02:50.561 --> 02:52.346
Well, ex-con brothers can.

02:52.389 --> 02:54.826
You don't know all my looks yet.

02:54.870 --> 02:57.220
You should meet with this guy,
see what he's offering.

02:57.264 --> 03:00.049
Really?You lower that markup,

03:00.092 --> 03:02.225
could make room
for me to hire someone

03:02.269 --> 03:03.574
to run this place full-time.

03:06.447 --> 03:09.406
I think he just
offered you a job, Jimmy.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.060
Yeah, Sebastian, I know that.

03:11.103 --> 03:13.149
Okay.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.846
Oh, that's me.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.500

Navy contractor

03:16.544 --> 03:18.110

03:31.123 --> 03:32.777
LASALLE:
Morning, Doc.

03:32.821 --> 03:35.476
Victim is Jacob Bell.
Insurance actuary

03:35.519 --> 03:38.740
contracting with the Navy
on surplus supplies.

03:38.783 --> 03:41.308
Mr. Bell rates
an NCIS investigation?

03:41.351 --> 03:45.355
NOPD asked us to take a look
considering the cause of death.

03:47.357 --> 03:49.229
Looks like strangulation.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.926
That's an unpleasant way to go.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.189
We don't usually get called
for the pleasant ones.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.278
The suspect used
some kind of wire.

03:55.322 --> 03:59.239
The depth of the impression--
I'm thinking a industrial wire.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.416
Sebastian.I wasn't sleeping.

04:02.459 --> 04:03.765
Though, honestly,
I-I probably could.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.767
You know, this back seat
is so spacious.

04:05.810 --> 04:09.074
If it wasn't for the dead guy.What are you doing back there?

04:09.118 --> 04:11.294
I was looking for evidence,

04:11.338 --> 04:13.383
but there's none,
other than the fact

04:13.427 --> 04:15.559
that the suspect could have been
lying back here in wait

04:15.603 --> 04:17.300
for hours, comfortably.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.563
So suspect lies in the back

04:19.607 --> 04:22.653
with industrial wire,
kills Jacob

04:22.697 --> 04:24.394
quickly, and leaves
without a trace.

04:24.438 --> 04:26.396
That sounds professional.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.137
This guy counted pencils
for the Navy, right?

04:28.180 --> 04:29.878
Who would put
a hit out on him?

04:29.921 --> 04:31.488
Well, victim only lives
a few miles away.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.360
Hannah and Tammy are talking
to the family now.

04:33.403 --> 04:35.144
Well, hopefully,
they can find some answers.

04:36.711 --> 04:39.017
MOLLY:
I don't know what to say.

04:39.061 --> 04:42.804
I know it's a shock, Mrs. Bell.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.893
We had breakfast
this morning.

04:44.936 --> 04:48.113
We were making plans
for the holidays.

04:48.157 --> 04:50.290
We're truly sorry
for your loss.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.814
It can't be true.
SAM:
What can't be true?

04:52.857 --> 04:55.643
Who are they?

04:55.686 --> 04:57.166
Can you give us a minute
with your mom?

04:57.209 --> 04:59.124
Mom, what's going on?

04:59.168 --> 05:01.301
Your... father...

05:03.303 --> 05:05.348
What?
Is Dad okay?

05:05.392 --> 05:06.741
Maybe you could...Yeah.
No.

05:06.784 --> 05:08.395
I want to know what happened.MOLLY:
It's okay.

05:08.438 --> 05:10.005
I'll tell you.

05:10.048 --> 05:12.268
Just go with her, please.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.271
Come on, it
won't be long.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.970
Come on.

05:20.581 --> 05:23.235
I've known Jacob
since I was 20.

05:23.279 --> 05:24.541
That's half my life.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.456
That's a long time
to know someone.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.415
It means
you know everything about him.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.460
You can help us find
who did this.

05:30.504 --> 05:33.376
How can I help?I need to know about

05:33.420 --> 05:35.030
people he worked with,
friends, enemies.

05:35.073 --> 05:37.641
I don't know anything
about his work.

05:37.685 --> 05:41.253
I guess it sounds strange, but
I don't really know his friends.

05:41.297 --> 05:42.603
You're in shock.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.431
He was an attentive dad

05:44.474 --> 05:46.520
and a loving husband.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.000
When he was around, he was
everything you'd want.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.524
Did he travel a lot?

05:50.567 --> 05:53.265
Oh, constantly.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.006
Work had him traveling two
weeks out of every month.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.748
For insurance?
Yes.

05:57.792 --> 06:01.883
We were grateful for the
living he made, but he missed

06:01.926 --> 06:03.928
birthdays, holidays,

06:03.972 --> 06:05.539
our anniversary.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.062
We made do.

06:07.105 --> 06:09.499
That sounds hard.
I guess

06:09.543 --> 06:11.719
when you ask me what I know
about Jacob's life

06:11.762 --> 06:15.984
outside of this house...
I know nothing.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.638
He was here and...

06:17.681 --> 06:21.381
then he was gone.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.561
Why does an insurance actuary

06:27.604 --> 06:30.390
travel for work
six months out of the year?

06:30.433 --> 06:32.087
GREGORIO:
According to his
company, he wasn't.

06:32.130 --> 06:34.655
Job required no
travel time at all.So he was lying

06:34.698 --> 06:36.570
to his family. Why?HANNAH:
Great question.

06:36.613 --> 06:37.658
He certainly made it look like

06:37.701 --> 06:39.007
he was flying
all over the world.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.878
Credit card charges

06:40.922 --> 06:43.707
for plane tickets,
airport parking, hotels.

06:43.751 --> 06:46.536
What do you mean he made it look
like he was flying?

06:46.580 --> 06:48.016
Well, according to the TSA,
he never got

06:48.059 --> 06:50.235
on any of those planes,
not for the last year at least.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.368
But if his wife
checked his credit cards,

06:52.412 --> 06:53.761
she'd think he did.
All the charges lined up.

06:53.804 --> 06:56.590
What was Jacob Bell doing
with his extra time?

06:56.633 --> 06:58.418
His kids have any insights?They're in the dark

06:58.461 --> 07:00.898
just as much as Molly.PATTON:
Then allow me to shed

07:00.942 --> 07:02.552
some light on this.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.206
I've been scanning
security footage

07:04.249 --> 07:06.469
from airport long-term parking.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.428
That's Jacob Bell
from a couple of weeks ago.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.430
HANNAH:
So we know he went

07:10.473 --> 07:12.475
to the parking lot.
Where did he go after that?

07:12.519 --> 07:13.824
PATTON:
Oh, he didn't go far at all.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.565
Two rows over
to another vehicle.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.002
LASALLE:
You get us a license plate?

07:18.046 --> 07:20.440
License plate, registration,
and a name--

07:20.483 --> 07:22.703
Jacob Landry.

07:22.746 --> 07:24.574
That's our Jacob.

07:24.618 --> 07:26.010
Two identities.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.882
LASALLE:
And two careers.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.884
This Jacob runs a security
and alarm company

07:29.927 --> 07:31.494
out of Gulfport, Mississippi.

07:31.538 --> 07:34.628
That's only an hour away.I'll drive.

07:34.671 --> 07:37.457
HANNAH:
So, Jacob Landry

07:37.500 --> 07:39.154
lives here with
Amanda, huh?

07:39.197 --> 07:41.504
Two complete families,
two complete lives.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.506
Yeah. We're about
to blow 'em both up.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.508
Ugh. Sometimes
I hate my job.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.077
Hey.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.078
Hi.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.340
Can I help you?

07:51.383 --> 07:53.124
Amanda Landry
live here?
Yeah.

07:53.168 --> 07:55.039
That's my mom.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.693
I'm Special Agent Khoury,

07:56.737 --> 07:58.826
this is Special Agent Gregorio
with NCIS.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.349
We need to speak to her.

08:00.392 --> 08:02.133
What's going on?

08:02.177 --> 08:04.484
Do you know this man?
Yeah.

08:04.527 --> 08:05.572
It's my dad.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.401
Did something happen?

08:09.445 --> 08:10.968
We need to speak to your mother.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.057
Yeah.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.798
Hold on.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.496
Mom?

08:16.539 --> 08:17.758
You need to
come in here.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.281
Did you know
he had a son?

08:19.324 --> 08:21.675
No. Didn't come up
in background.

08:24.242 --> 08:25.809
AMANDA:
I've known Jacob
for 25 years.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.855
He doesn't have any secrets.

08:27.898 --> 08:29.639
He doesn't have any enemies.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.946
Do you know what he does
in his personal time?

08:31.989 --> 08:33.251
Well, when he's
not at work, he's...

08:33.295 --> 08:37.517
he's with us,
or he's at Red Crossbills.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.475
Ornithology club.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.955
It was his passion.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.609
AMANDA:
Sorry.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.393
This just doesn't make
any sense.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.047
He was in Arkansas
installing a security system.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.570
This is just...
this is a mistake.

08:47.614 --> 08:50.399
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Landry.

08:50.442 --> 08:52.575
He was found
in Jefferson Parish.

08:54.142 --> 08:57.537
Well, why would he be
in Louisiana?

08:57.580 --> 09:00.496
The answer to that is
a little delicate. Um,

09:00.540 --> 09:03.325
Charlie, do you mind waiting
outside for a moment?

09:03.368 --> 09:06.284
No. Anything you have to say

09:06.328 --> 09:08.548
to my mom, you
can say to me.It's okay.

09:08.591 --> 09:09.940
Tell us.

09:09.984 --> 09:12.769
Do you know the name Molly Bell?

09:16.381 --> 09:18.340
No. Who

09:19.820 --> 09:22.692
That's Jacob's other wife.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.353
That was rough.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.355
Yeah, well, imagine
living your whole life

09:33.398 --> 09:35.400
not knowing about the iceberg
right in front of you.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.707
There's a difference between not
knowing and not acknowledging.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.448
Speaking from experience?

09:39.491 --> 09:40.884
My cousin Theresa's wedding.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.017
FBI busts into the
church rectory,

09:43.060 --> 09:44.975
arrests my uncle
for embezzlement

09:45.019 --> 09:47.456
right before he was gonna
walk her down the aisle.

09:47.499 --> 09:49.632
Must have made
for an awkward ceremony.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.765
No. My aunt carried on
as if nothing happened.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.331
My father walked her
down the aisle.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.724
We got to the reception.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.639
No one says a word
about Uncle Marco.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.424
18 months in prison. To this
day, can't bring it up.

09:59.468 --> 10:02.340
You think one of these women
knew Jacob had two families?

10:02.384 --> 10:04.560
I'm saying, he
was murdered,

10:04.604 --> 10:06.736
and discovering your
husband has a second life--

10:06.780 --> 10:08.956
it's a hell of a motive.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.610
Not wrong there.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.394
Lasalle and Sebastian

10:12.437 --> 10:13.830
are at Jacob's
security shop.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.658
Maybe they'll find
something there.
Yeah.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.660
SEBASTIAN:
Two wives.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.923
Two sets of kids.
Two full careers.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.838
I got to admit,
Jacob impresses me.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.448
I mean, aside from the whole

10:23.492 --> 10:25.407
lying and getting murdered part.Yeah, he put a lot

10:25.450 --> 10:26.408
of effort into it.

10:26.451 --> 10:27.757
You got to wonder why.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.150
Well, maybe for him,

10:29.193 --> 10:30.934
the love of two women
was enough.

10:30.978 --> 10:34.764
Well, Jacob-- he covered
his tracks a little too well.

10:34.808 --> 10:37.201
All the trips to the
airport, the hotels.

10:37.245 --> 10:38.942
Even invoices
to out-of-state companies

10:38.986 --> 10:41.684
for security systems he probably
never even installed.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.251
Yeah, and a garrote
to the throat

10:43.294 --> 10:45.775
is not a crime of passion.

10:45.819 --> 10:48.778
Jacob was into something else.
We just got to figure out what.

10:48.822 --> 10:51.999
Even if this store was a front,
he spared no expense.

10:52.042 --> 10:54.262
I mean, most of this equipment
is military-grade stuff.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.873
I can't imagine there's much
of a demand for it in Gulfport.

10:56.917 --> 10:59.223
I may have something here.
Take a look at these shelves.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.704
All that stuff's pretty basic.No.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.141
Not the equipment. The shelves.

11:04.185 --> 11:06.709
Look at those scratches.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.059
Matches the scuff marks

11:09.103 --> 11:10.800
on the floor.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.933
This thing's been moved
a bunch.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.199
Bingo.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.858
Hmm.Hmm.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.948
Got a lot of guns here.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.645
That's not too strange

11:29.689 --> 11:31.212
for this neck of the woods.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.737
Uh-huh. Take a look at this.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.739
Passports, IDs,

11:36.783 --> 11:39.568
half a dozen countries,
all with different aliases.

11:39.611 --> 11:42.223
It's like James Bond's man cave.

11:44.138 --> 11:46.357
Jacob definitely had
more than one secret.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.751
Hold on.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.144
Got a laptop and...

11:50.187 --> 11:51.972
some kind
of coded documents here.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.715
I can't really make 'em out.

11:57.499 --> 12:00.197
What the hell?It's self-destructing.
Come on, we got to go.

12:02.156 --> 12:03.505
Sebastian!

12:07.378 --> 12:09.772
What'd you do that for?Had to get something.

12:09.816 --> 12:12.079
Brave.

12:12.122 --> 12:14.777
Stupid but, uh, brave.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.317
PRIDE:
Thank you, sir.

12:33.361 --> 12:34.797
Well, I appreciate the support.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.799
I'll fill you in as soon
as I know something.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.322
Yeah.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.368
That is quite a circus.

12:40.411 --> 12:41.891
FBI, NSA, CIA,

12:41.935 --> 12:43.763
all trying to get a piece
of this investigation.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.156
Director Vance
pulled some strings.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.942
We need to find out how a
spy got a Navy contract.

12:48.985 --> 12:52.162
NCIS runs point
until we get clarity here.

12:52.206 --> 12:53.598
All we know so far

12:53.642 --> 12:54.730
is that Jacob
was a sleeper agent

12:54.774 --> 12:56.732
operating undetected
for 20 years.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.430
According to what Lasalle
and Sebastian were able to pull

12:59.474 --> 13:02.520
from Jacob's secret room,
he's probably Russian.

13:02.564 --> 13:05.654
We got to uncover
what his mission was here.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.656
And who decided to kill him.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.919
What about the wives?They're being polygraphed

13:09.963 --> 13:11.616
and questioned.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.705
Gregorio's in there
with Molly now.

13:17.753 --> 13:20.147
MOLLY: You want to tell
me where my kids are?

13:20.190 --> 13:21.931
They're right next
door, Mrs. Bell.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.367
Well, I'd like to see them.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.674
And you will as soon as
the interview is done.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.894
I don't understand.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.286
You hooked me up
to your machine.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.679
I answered your questions.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.812
What more is there to say

13:32.855 --> 13:34.814
And who is this?

13:34.857 --> 13:36.293
I'm Special Agent Pride.

13:36.337 --> 13:37.599
You're the boss?

13:37.642 --> 13:39.166
Maybe you can tell me why

13:39.209 --> 13:40.732
I'm being treated
like a criminal.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.865
Your polygraph results
were inconclusive.

13:42.909 --> 13:45.346
What does that mean?

13:45.389 --> 13:46.956
Means it's impossible
for the examiner

13:47.000 --> 13:48.784
to tell if you're lying.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.005
I just found out
my murdered husband

13:52.048 --> 13:54.616
had another family
and was some kind of spy.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.792
I'm not the liar here.I understand

13:56.836 --> 13:58.185
how upsetting this is.

13:58.228 --> 14:00.143
How can you possibly understand?

14:00.187 --> 14:02.580
Idon't understand.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.408
20 years we were married.

14:04.452 --> 14:07.281
20 years I thought I knew
his heart.

14:07.324 --> 14:09.196
In one day that is all gone.

14:09.239 --> 14:10.719
You're absolutely right.

14:12.242 --> 14:14.723
There's no way we can know
what it was like

14:14.766 --> 14:16.725
to live with Jacob.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.814
Which is why we need

14:18.858 --> 14:21.338
your cooperation
with these questions.

14:24.254 --> 14:28.389
If I do, will you please
let me see my children?

14:28.432 --> 14:31.348
I will take you to them
personally.

14:37.528 --> 14:39.922
These documents belonged
to Jacob.

14:43.143 --> 14:44.884
I want to know
if you can explain any of them.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.371
PRIDE:
I know this is hard for you.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.373
Appreciate your cooperation.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.201
Can I take my kids home now?Yes.

14:58.245 --> 14:59.507
I'll be in touch with you
as soon as we have

14:59.550 --> 15:01.204
more information.You.

15:01.248 --> 15:02.205
I want to talk to you.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.293
Okay, Ms. Landry...Is that...?

15:03.337 --> 15:04.642
Ms. Landry, you can't do this.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.862
I want you to look me
in the eye.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.864
Mom.This is Jacob's son.

15:08.908 --> 15:09.865
Hannah.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.346
I have kids, too.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.348
Mrs. Landry,
please come with me.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.524
There are lives that you
have destroyed here.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.265
I didn't do any of this.All right, all right.

15:18.308 --> 15:20.876
Look, Ms. Landry, you need to go
with Special Agent Khoury

15:20.920 --> 15:22.182
and answer some questions.
Both of you.HANNAH: Come on.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.226
Go.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.186
Come on.

15:32.018 --> 15:35.456
What the hell is going on here?

15:40.417 --> 15:43.203
PATTON:
Yeah, I got to

15:43.246 --> 15:44.900
hand it to our boy Jacob.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.423
He knew how to encrypt a laptop.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.164
Well, you know,
if you're having trouble...

15:48.208 --> 15:49.339
Did I say I was having trouble?

15:49.383 --> 15:51.776
You seem
a little discouraged, yeah.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.256
Look, these protocols
are obscure and in Russian,

15:53.300 --> 15:55.041
so, yeah,
it's a little challenging.

15:55.084 --> 15:57.782
Okay, well, the whole
Russian division of the NSA

15:57.826 --> 15:59.262
is on deck to help, so
we can just call them.

15:59.306 --> 16:00.568
Yeah, well, we're gonna
have to tag 'em in soon,

16:00.611 --> 16:02.918
'cause every file
is individually encrypted

16:02.962 --> 16:04.398
with a unique code.

16:04.441 --> 16:05.877
Well, did you get
anything at all?

16:05.921 --> 16:09.142
PATTON:
Yeah. A secure message chain.

16:09.185 --> 16:11.492
Jacob was communicating with
at least one other local person.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.320
What do the communications say?

16:13.363 --> 16:14.408
I'm not fully sure. I haven't

16:14.451 --> 16:15.496
decoded it all yet.

16:15.539 --> 16:16.976
It seems like an argument.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.892
SEBASTIAN:
Jacob's worried

16:20.936 --> 16:22.677
the assignment's
too dangerous. Why?

16:22.720 --> 16:23.939
'Cause it happened
close to home.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.201
SEBASTIAN:
Well, his partner doesn't seem

16:25.245 --> 16:27.029
to share his concern.

16:27.073 --> 16:30.772
Whatever this assignment is,
it's here in New Orleans.

16:30.815 --> 16:32.948
All right, keep hacking.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.994
I'll let Pride and Hannah know.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.957
Hoping you found
some evidence of our killer.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.828
I'm afraid not, Christopher.

16:43.872 --> 16:47.354
The fingernail scrapings were
negative for skin or fibers,

16:47.397 --> 16:49.399
and there weren't any
defense wounds to examine.

16:49.443 --> 16:52.402
But you called me down
here, so that means...

16:52.446 --> 16:54.709
I did find something unusual
in Mr. Bell's blood.

16:54.752 --> 16:57.059
Or is it Mr. Landry?

16:57.103 --> 17:00.106
Uh, let's just call him Jacob.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.630
Well, Jacob had atropine
in his bloodstream.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.371
LASALLE:
Atropine.

17:04.414 --> 17:06.460
That's the same thing you find
in jimsonweed.

17:06.503 --> 17:07.591
It's a poison, right?

17:07.635 --> 17:10.029
Well, it can be fatal
in large doses,

17:10.072 --> 17:14.207
but it has medicinal qualities
if taken in smaller amounts.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.209
Hmm. Medicinal how?

17:16.252 --> 17:17.688
Well, for one thing,
it can be used in surgery

17:17.732 --> 17:20.909
to decrease the production
of saliva in the patient.

17:20.952 --> 17:25.479
Jacob, he didn't have
any recent operations.

17:25.522 --> 17:26.958
True.

17:27.002 --> 17:31.398
But it can also be used
as an antitoxin, too.

17:31.441 --> 17:34.531
I'll dig deeper.

17:34.575 --> 17:37.534
More questions than answers.

17:37.578 --> 17:40.494
Yeah, I don't know what
to think, Christopher.

17:40.537 --> 17:43.758
Other than nothing
about this case seems arbitrary.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.677
Hey.

17:49.720 --> 17:53.333
Amanda's polygraph went
more smoothly than Molly's.

17:53.376 --> 17:56.075
Results suggest she had no idea
he was a spy. Charlie, either.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.642
You set 'em loose?Mm-hmm, for now.

17:58.686 --> 18:01.863
I get the feeling
you don't believe the poly.

18:01.906 --> 18:03.995
Considering Amanda's performance
when she confronted Molly,

18:04.039 --> 18:07.347
I was surprised
at her poise in the room.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.349
It could be nothing.

18:09.392 --> 18:13.570
Sebastian says that Jacob
had a partner here

18:13.614 --> 18:16.356
and a mission
he was afraid to complete.Yeah.

18:16.399 --> 18:17.792
That's not all he says.
I just spoke to him.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.750
Patton decrypted
a new chat stream

18:19.794 --> 18:21.665
downloaded on Jacob's laptop.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.798
New as in...?Happening now.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.105
Jacob's mystery partner
and someone else.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.237
May I?Sure.

18:33.199 --> 18:34.896
In code, of course.Yeah.

18:34.939 --> 18:37.159
And Patton's nowhere near
breaking it. However...

18:37.203 --> 18:38.900
see these symbols here?Yeah.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.555
Patton thinks they might be
a latitude and a longitude.

18:41.598 --> 18:42.556
Some kind of meeting place?

18:42.599 --> 18:44.514
Mm-hmm.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.389
The fountain at Audubon Park.

18:49.432 --> 18:52.696
All right, get the
team there ASAP.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.134
If there's a meeting or a
dead drop, we need eyes on it.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.526
Got it.

18:57.571 --> 18:59.181
Jimmy, this isn't the best time.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.531
JIMMY: I had a issue
with the liquor distributor.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.577
Well, whatever it is
is gonna have to wait.

19:03.620 --> 19:04.491
I'm in the middle
of something big.

19:04.534 --> 19:06.014
Uh, that's the problem.

19:06.057 --> 19:08.016
I'm in the middle
of something big, too.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.585
I got arrested.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.899
If you'd do that,
I'd really appreciate it.

19:21.943 --> 19:23.379
Hey.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.555
Yeah, well, as soon as possible.

19:25.599 --> 19:28.515
Thank you. Hello.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.865
Yeah, I got to go.

19:32.475 --> 19:33.694
Meeting with
the liquor distributor

19:33.737 --> 19:35.217
didn't go so well, huh?

19:35.261 --> 19:36.610
Didn't go at all.

19:36.653 --> 19:39.221
Was on my way to, to his
warehouse in Irish Channel.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.397
Cops pulled me over
for a busted taillight.

19:41.441 --> 19:44.008
Busted taillights don't
get you handcuffed.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.401
They do when there's
an open warrant.

19:45.445 --> 19:47.360
You got an outstanding warrant?

19:47.403 --> 19:49.362
It would appear that way.

19:49.405 --> 19:50.580
It's almost ten years old.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.540
Fraud charge

19:53.583 --> 19:55.368
from my former life.

19:55.411 --> 19:59.589
Yeah, well...
they're taking it serious.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.200
They're gonna process you.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.158
Aw, man, I messed up.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.204
Everybody's got a past, Jimmy.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.770
I mean staying in New Orleans.

20:06.814 --> 20:08.424
I should've left weeks ago.

20:08.468 --> 20:11.819
Running is not the solution
to this particular problem.

20:11.862 --> 20:14.430
With all due respect, Dwayne,

20:14.474 --> 20:17.041
I been in this situation plenty.

20:17.085 --> 20:18.434
So have I.

20:18.478 --> 20:19.957
Well, yeah, but on the
opposite side of the desk.

20:20.001 --> 20:22.221
You've seen my record.
They're gonna no-bail me.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.658
Even if I make a deal,
I'm looking at time here.

20:24.701 --> 20:25.746
Not if I help.

20:25.789 --> 20:28.052
What are you gonna do?I'm gonna talk

20:28.096 --> 20:29.358
to the detectives, the D.A.,

20:29.402 --> 20:30.838
judge if I have to.

20:30.881 --> 20:32.405
I'm not sure you've noticed,

20:32.448 --> 20:34.407
but I'm kind of a big deal
around here.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.800
You'd do that for me?

20:36.844 --> 20:38.411
Already am.

20:38.454 --> 20:40.064
Bail will be posted.
You'll get released.

20:40.108 --> 20:41.849
I can't make the charges
go away,

20:41.892 --> 20:43.894
but I'm pretty sure there'll be

20:43.938 --> 20:46.549
no jail time.

20:46.593 --> 20:49.248
I don't know what to say.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.467
It's not something
for nothing, Jimmy.

20:51.511 --> 20:54.035
I believe in you.

20:55.471 --> 20:58.213
I'm pretty sure
you won't disappoint.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.482
Now, listen.

21:06.526 --> 21:09.659
I'm getting you, uh,
sorted out here.

21:09.703 --> 21:12.096
Then you need to go back home.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.924
'Cause I got a case

21:13.968 --> 21:16.231
I have to deal with.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.342
SEBASTIAN:
You two see anything yet?

21:40.386 --> 21:42.779
HANNAH:
Nothing so far.

21:42.823 --> 21:44.781
Been here for a few hours.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.130
I got to ask, man,
all these people here

21:46.174 --> 21:47.697
in the middle of the day
at the park,

21:47.741 --> 21:49.917
don't they have jobs?It's the gig economy, man.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.484
Only fools like us
work all day.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.790
Do you even know
what you're talking about?

21:53.834 --> 21:55.270
Barely.

21:57.881 --> 21:59.492
Think we got a bite, guys.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.887
Yep. Amanda Landry
just got here.

22:03.931 --> 22:05.846
Heading in from St. Charles.

22:07.543 --> 22:10.459
LASALLE:
She's wearing a blonde wig.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.069
Doesn't bode well
for her innocence.

22:12.113 --> 22:14.028
So, what, so she's
a spy now, too,

22:14.071 --> 22:15.725
working
with her husband?

22:15.769 --> 22:18.162
Yeah, and must be a good one
if she beat that poly.

22:18.206 --> 22:21.165
Eyes open. Make any
suspicious moves, we grab 'em.

22:21.209 --> 22:22.210
SEBASTIAN:
Copy that.

22:26.475 --> 22:27.824
She just pulled out

22:27.868 --> 22:28.956
some kind of a package.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.479
Can you guys see
what that is?

22:30.523 --> 22:31.959
GREGORIO:
It's a...

22:32.002 --> 22:34.396
some kind of book.

22:37.878 --> 22:39.488
All right,
she's on the move.
Let's take her.

22:39.532 --> 22:40.533
Wait, hold on.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.317
We need to talk.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.406
She's got company.

22:44.450 --> 22:45.842
It's Molly.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.670
What are you doing?
We need to leave.

22:47.714 --> 22:49.542
We can't be seen together.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.587
That's it.
Let's take 'em now.

22:52.545 --> 22:54.111
You need to tell
me about Jacob.

22:55.025 --> 22:56.244
We're going.

22:56.287 --> 22:57.593
HANNAH:
Christopher!

Sebastian! Cut 'em off!

22:58.899 --> 23:00.466
GREGORIO:
Stop now! Federal agents!

23:25.882 --> 23:27.014
I got the license plate.

23:27.057 --> 23:28.450
And Charlie Landry
was driving the car.

23:28.494 --> 23:31.410
Looks like Jacob's spy ring
was a family affair.

23:42.464 --> 23:45.162
GREGORIO: Jacob Bell,
aka Jacob Landry, was

23:45.206 --> 23:47.164
some sort of Russian spy
before he was murdered

23:47.208 --> 23:48.862
yesterday morning.He had two wives,

23:48.905 --> 23:50.646
Molly and Amanda.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.300
Both seemed to work with him.

23:52.343 --> 23:54.258
GREGORIO: They went to
Audubon Park to pick up

23:54.302 --> 23:56.130
a package connected to
Jacob's last mission.

23:56.173 --> 23:58.654
LASALLE: Escaped capture
thanks to Charlie Landry,

23:58.698 --> 24:00.308
Jacob's oldest son.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.485
Got a BOLO out on Charlie's car.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.095
Patton's checking
credit card charges,

24:05.139 --> 24:07.358
cell phones, security cameras...Recovered the package

24:07.402 --> 24:09.578
at the dead drop,
book on ornithology.

24:09.622 --> 24:11.014
Sebastian's got it now.

24:11.058 --> 24:14.757
Mm. 50 investigators
on this case, and we are still

24:14.801 --> 24:15.889
at square one.

24:15.932 --> 24:16.890
Yeah.Maybe a little farther along

24:16.933 --> 24:18.065
than that.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.893
Just spoke to our
friends at the CIA.

24:19.936 --> 24:22.286
They enlightened me about
Jacob's work with the Russians.

24:22.330 --> 24:25.333
He did travel over the years
using his multiple identities.

24:25.376 --> 24:27.378
LASALLE:
San Francisco, Portland,

24:27.422 --> 24:29.206
Buffalo.Each one of those trips

24:29.250 --> 24:30.556
coincided with
the mysterious death

24:30.599 --> 24:32.079
of someone
on the CIA watch list.

24:32.122 --> 24:34.168
Former spy,

24:34.211 --> 24:36.518
visiting foreign politician,
Russian steel magnate.

24:36.562 --> 24:38.999
Jacob was an assassin.And a good one.

24:39.042 --> 24:41.784
He upped his game
about eight months ago.

24:41.828 --> 24:43.003
He went from staging
car accidents

24:43.046 --> 24:44.961
to poisonings.

24:45.005 --> 24:47.007
Last victim died
from Novichok agent.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.791
PRIDE:
Yeah, one of the more toxic

24:48.835 --> 24:51.968
nerve agents-- Russians
developed it 20 years ago.

24:52.012 --> 24:54.580
LASALLE:
Doc Wade found atropine

24:54.623 --> 24:57.191
in Jacob's blood--
it's an antitoxin.

24:57.234 --> 25:00.542
Could be his antidote if he was
dealing with this nerve agent.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.805
HANNAH:
If it's true, it means
our missing suspects

25:02.849 --> 25:04.546
have got a very lethal weapon.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.766
We need to find them
and their target.

25:08.071 --> 25:09.508
You okay?

25:09.551 --> 25:11.031
Yeah.

25:11.074 --> 25:12.119
I'm gonna head out

25:12.162 --> 25:13.424
to Belle Chasse.

25:13.468 --> 25:15.470
Coordinate with the FBI.

25:17.298 --> 25:19.256
And as far as books go,
this has got to be

25:19.300 --> 25:20.954
one of the worst ones
I've ever read.

25:20.997 --> 25:22.956
It's like the writer
didn't even care.Please tell me

25:22.999 --> 25:24.740
there's a hidden
message in it.Not inthe book.

25:24.784 --> 25:26.046
But onit.

25:26.089 --> 25:28.831
So this... is
the California Clapper Rail.

25:28.875 --> 25:30.920
It's one of the rarest birds
in North America.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.443
It's also known
as Ridgeway's Rail,

25:32.487 --> 25:33.923
or its scientific name,

25:33.967 --> 25:35.838
Rallus Longirostris Obsoletus.

25:35.882 --> 25:38.101
Sebastian, is there
a spy-related thing
coming up soon?

25:38.145 --> 25:39.755
PATTON :
I told you

25:39.799 --> 25:42.584
she wouldn't be interested
in all them bird names.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.806
All right, well, then
perhaps I can interest you

25:46.849 --> 25:47.981
in some steganography?

25:51.027 --> 25:52.986
HANNAH:
There's a code in the photo.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.640
Any idea what it means?This is where Triple P

25:54.683 --> 25:55.945
saves the conversation.

25:55.989 --> 25:58.208
Now, based off the previous
codes we deciphered,

25:58.252 --> 25:59.862
this looks like a set of orders.

26:02.299 --> 26:04.388
HANNAH:
"Mission is a go.

26:04.432 --> 26:05.651
"Tomorrow afternoon.

26:05.694 --> 26:08.610
Extraction to follow
successful termination."

26:08.654 --> 26:10.481
We got a timeline.

26:10.525 --> 26:13.093
Okay.

26:24.887 --> 26:28.021
Don't mind me, I'm
just dropping by

26:28.064 --> 26:31.241
to change my shirt.

26:31.285 --> 26:35.158
You can leave my key next to
the goodbye letter if you want.

26:35.202 --> 26:36.507
Let me explain.

26:36.551 --> 26:40.076
Ah, no need.
You're skipping town.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.644
I think it's a mistake,
but you're a grown man.

26:42.688 --> 26:43.819
Dwayne, I'm sorry.

26:43.863 --> 26:44.864
Where you going?

26:44.907 --> 26:46.126
Someplace that's not here.

26:49.999 --> 26:52.262
Think that'll make
your problems go away?

26:52.306 --> 26:54.961
Don't know, but it...
will keep you out of it.

26:55.004 --> 26:57.398
You leave, I'm gonna have
plenty of trouble

26:57.441 --> 27:01.054
with NOPD and the D.A.

27:01.097 --> 27:04.274
You'll have more
trouble if I stay.

27:04.318 --> 27:06.755
What do you think's
gonna happen?
I don't know.

27:06.799 --> 27:09.410
I got a gift
for bringing down people

27:09.453 --> 27:10.977
who care for me.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.805
Well, I'm a grown man, too,

27:12.848 --> 27:16.199
and I get to decide
who I care for...

27:16.243 --> 27:18.158
and take the risks.

27:18.201 --> 27:19.725
It's not that easy.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.552
You've been running
most of your life.

27:21.596 --> 27:24.425
Hasn't worked for you.

27:24.468 --> 27:27.776
Try not running for once,
see what happens.

27:27.820 --> 27:30.561
Dwayne, I...Look...

27:30.605 --> 27:32.302
either way, it's up to you.

27:32.346 --> 27:34.435
But if you do stay,

27:34.478 --> 27:38.831
we have an appointment with
the D.A. tomorrow afternoon.

27:38.874 --> 27:41.007
12:00.

27:46.926 --> 27:49.319
You're in early.Yeah, I never left.

27:49.363 --> 27:50.451
I've been searching
traffic grids all night

27:50.494 --> 27:52.279
for Charlie's getaway car.

27:52.322 --> 27:55.456
And?Good reminder how bad
drivers are around here.

27:55.499 --> 27:57.850
Yeah, well,
you've never been to Istanbul.

27:57.893 --> 28:00.853
As far as I can tell,
Amanda Landry and Molly Bell

28:00.896 --> 28:02.202
are highly trained
operatives.

28:02.245 --> 28:05.205
They're not coming
back online.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.772
Hold that thought, boss.

28:06.815 --> 28:08.774
Charlie Landry's GPS
just popped back up.

28:08.817 --> 28:10.253
You're kidding me.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.603
It's near a strip mall in Tremé.
It's not moving, either.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.605
Maybe we got lucky.Or it's a trap.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.520
Either way, we get Sebastian
and Lasalle and find out.

28:16.564 --> 28:18.435
Yep.

28:23.223 --> 28:24.398
HANNAH:
Got Charlie's SUV.

28:24.441 --> 28:26.095
Eyes open, okay.

28:26.139 --> 28:27.618
We don't know what
we're walking into.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.236
Car's clear.

28:36.279 --> 28:37.759
Probably inside the strip mall.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.460
LEAH:
Don't shoot!

28:44.461 --> 28:46.115
What are you doing here?

28:46.159 --> 28:47.247
Mom called and told us
to get here.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.162
She needs our help.Where is she?

28:51.686 --> 28:53.079
Sebastian, you stay with them.

28:53.122 --> 28:54.907
Lasalle, take the rear.
Gregorio, you're with me.

29:07.528 --> 29:09.530
HANNAH:
Don't move.

29:09.573 --> 29:11.924
Get out of here now.
This place isn't safe.

29:14.491 --> 29:16.102
Novichok agent?

29:16.145 --> 29:18.800
Yeah, it could be airborne.Gregorio,

29:18.844 --> 29:20.497
roll a hazmat team now.

29:39.473 --> 29:40.953
PRIDE:
Thanks. Give me an update.

29:40.996 --> 29:42.737
Hannah's inside with Charlie.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.391
He's wounded.
Molly Bell is dead.

29:44.434 --> 29:45.784
Novichok agent?

29:45.827 --> 29:48.134
That's what Charlie said.
Molly's kids are safe.

29:48.177 --> 29:50.745
Lasalle put them in protective
custody with a social worker.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.965
What about Amanda Landry?Nowhere to be found.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.272
Okay.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.370
How you doing, Hannah?

30:07.414 --> 30:09.808
It's been a bit of a day.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.026
Hazmat team's on the way.

30:11.070 --> 30:13.072
We're gonna get this
figured out.

30:13.115 --> 30:15.030
HANNAH:
Charlie needs medical attention.

30:15.074 --> 30:17.163
He's got a bullet in his leg.I'm working on it.

30:17.206 --> 30:19.034
Meantime, maybe he can tell you
what happened.

30:19.078 --> 30:20.470
We're working on it, too.

30:20.514 --> 30:21.820
Leah and Sam?

30:21.863 --> 30:23.256
They're safe, Charlie.

30:23.299 --> 30:25.432
Why don't you tell Hannah
what you know?

30:25.475 --> 30:26.955
We're gonna get you out of there

30:26.999 --> 30:28.174
soon as we can.

30:28.217 --> 30:30.132
Hang in there.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.007
What do you know, Charlie?

30:35.050 --> 30:38.662
I was trying to fix this.

30:38.706 --> 30:41.056
Get Molly and the kids
to safety.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.537
You turned the GPS on in
your car so we'd find you.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.802
Your mom killed Molly?

30:47.846 --> 30:49.935
CHARLIE:
She's not my mom.

30:50.979 --> 30:52.763
She's your handler.

30:52.807 --> 30:54.853
Jacob was, too.

30:56.637 --> 31:00.119
How old were you when
the GRU recruited you?

31:00.162 --> 31:01.990
Twelve.

31:02.034 --> 31:04.166
They sent me here
to live with them

31:04.210 --> 31:06.038
and train for missions.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.954
I ran dead drops,
surveillance.

31:08.997 --> 31:12.392
My specialty
would be like Jacob.

31:12.435 --> 31:14.176
Assassination.

31:14.220 --> 31:17.049
I never killed anyone
before yesterday.

31:22.793 --> 31:25.187
Why'd you kill Jacob?

31:25.231 --> 31:27.798
I wasn't the only one
being trained.

31:27.842 --> 31:29.191
He was gonna use Leah.

31:29.235 --> 31:31.933
And Sam, too,
when he was old enough.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.501
He had me
help prepare them.

31:34.544 --> 31:37.808
You didn't want them
to go through what you did.

31:37.852 --> 31:41.116
I have no identity.

31:41.160 --> 31:44.815
All my memories
are cover stories.

31:44.859 --> 31:45.991
Trips I never took.

31:46.034 --> 31:48.036
Birthday parties
I never had.

31:50.691 --> 31:52.736
Leah and Sam deserve better.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.260
I understand.

31:55.348 --> 31:59.134
But you chose yesterday
to kill Jacob.

31:59.178 --> 32:02.268
I had to stop him
before today's mission.

32:03.269 --> 32:05.227
What's today's mission?

32:05.271 --> 32:08.187
I don't know the target,
but I know the poison.

32:08.230 --> 32:10.102
And the risks.

32:10.145 --> 32:12.234
Amanda's taking it over.
It's definitely gonna happen.

32:12.278 --> 32:15.020
What was Molly's role in this?

32:15.063 --> 32:17.413
She didn't have one.

32:17.457 --> 32:19.111
Jacob fell in love
with her years ago,

32:19.154 --> 32:20.416
and they started
a real family.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.114
She was at the dead
drop yesterday.

32:22.157 --> 32:25.247
She followed Amanda
after her interrogation.

32:25.291 --> 32:28.555
She wanted to know more
about Jacob's other life.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.209
What happened here, Charlie?

32:30.252 --> 32:33.212
Amanda brought us
in here to lay low.

32:33.255 --> 32:35.866
Forced Molly to call the kids.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.303
Promised they'd be safe.

32:37.346 --> 32:39.044
But it was a ploy.

32:39.087 --> 32:41.960
She was gonna take Molly out
and then take the kids.Yeah.

32:42.003 --> 32:44.223
I tried to stop her,
but she shot me.

32:44.266 --> 32:46.834
Dosed Molly
with the Novichok.

32:46.877 --> 32:49.315
Left me here
to watch her die.

32:49.358 --> 32:52.144
Just like we're gonna die.

32:52.187 --> 32:55.147
We are gonna die, Charlie.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.627
But not today.

33:04.243 --> 33:07.202
Hazmat team is here.

33:09.378 --> 33:11.119
SEBASTIAN:
Well, Hannah and Charlie are

33:11.163 --> 33:13.208
in the quarantine unit
at All Saints.

33:13.252 --> 33:14.905
Yeah, looks like
they avoided exposure,

33:14.949 --> 33:17.430
but they're being held
in isolation for 24 hours,

33:17.473 --> 33:19.345
just in case.GREGORIO:
That's a relief.

33:19.388 --> 33:22.130
Yeah. The only one
we have right now.Yeah, I examined the storefront.

33:22.174 --> 33:25.655
Amanda has a very potent dose
of Novichok agent with her.

33:25.699 --> 33:27.570
Oh, we don't have a clue
what the target is.

33:27.614 --> 33:29.094
I mean, could be
the water supply

33:29.137 --> 33:31.009
or a public event.I'm not so sure,

33:31.052 --> 33:32.227
Christopher.

33:32.271 --> 33:34.360
Charlie saw Amanda
transfer the nerve agent

33:34.403 --> 33:36.362
into a small aerosol bottle.

33:36.405 --> 33:37.580
Yeah, suggests
a limited range.

33:37.624 --> 33:38.799
A specific person.

33:38.842 --> 33:40.061
Fits with Jacob's pattern.

33:40.105 --> 33:42.063
He was an assassin,
not a terrorist.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.021
LASALLE:
All of his victims

33:43.064 --> 33:45.458
are high-profile targets.

33:45.501 --> 33:46.981
Politicians, spies.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.243
No one in New Orleans

33:48.287 --> 33:49.375
like that right now.

33:49.418 --> 33:50.811
No one we know of.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.336
We need to cast a wider net.

33:54.380 --> 33:55.685
I'll contact State
and the U.N.,

33:55.729 --> 33:58.340
see if they've got anyone
who fits the profile.

33:58.384 --> 33:59.733
Amanda is
New Orleans' most wanted.

33:59.776 --> 34:01.300
Every law enforcement agency
has her information.

34:01.343 --> 34:03.519
Too much heat to try to pull off
an assassination.

34:03.563 --> 34:04.564
PRIDE:
Unless...

34:04.607 --> 34:06.783
she's not pulling it off.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.785
Charlie also said

34:08.829 --> 34:11.919
that Jacob started training Leah

34:11.962 --> 34:13.747
to go into the family business.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.140
You think she could be in on it?

34:15.183 --> 34:16.750
I think we need to find out

34:16.793 --> 34:18.795
right now.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.408
SAM:
I don't understand.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.410
Why can't we talk to our mom?

34:24.453 --> 34:25.541
It's complicated
right now, Sam.

34:25.585 --> 34:27.456
We deserve to know
what's going on.

34:28.240 --> 34:29.806
I'm scared, Leah.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.548
Hey, there's no need
to be, all right?

34:32.592 --> 34:33.549
We've got two FBI agents

34:33.593 --> 34:35.421
right outside.
You guys are

34:35.464 --> 34:36.378
both safe.

34:38.293 --> 34:39.338
What was that?

34:39.381 --> 34:40.817
I-I don't know.

34:43.559 --> 34:45.126
Leah, Sam. It's Amanda.

34:45.170 --> 34:47.302
That's Charlie's mom.

34:47.346 --> 34:48.129
Sam, stay back.

34:48.173 --> 34:49.348
I got to call for help.

34:52.481 --> 34:53.482
Leah?

34:53.526 --> 34:54.962
It's okay.

34:55.876 --> 34:58.139
We can trust Amanda.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.448
Let's go.

35:03.449 --> 35:04.798
You'll be safe now.

35:26.559 --> 35:28.300
Just spoke to Pride.

35:28.343 --> 35:32.260
He got to the motel where the
FBI were holding Leah and Sam.

35:32.304 --> 35:34.262
He was too late?FBI agents were murdered.

35:34.306 --> 35:36.221
Social worker had
a fractured skull.

35:36.264 --> 35:38.179
And Leah and Sam
are missing.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.180
It's probably Amanda.

35:39.224 --> 35:40.834
Any idea where
she took them?

35:40.877 --> 35:43.445
Gregorio and Pride
are searching with the FBI,

35:43.489 --> 35:45.839
but nothing yet.
PATTON:
Well, we don't know
where they went,

35:45.882 --> 35:47.319
but we might know
where they're going.

35:47.362 --> 35:49.190
You got a lead
on Amanda's target?Yeah.

35:49.234 --> 35:50.365
We cross-referenced
federal watch lists

35:50.409 --> 35:51.888
as well as international ones.

35:51.932 --> 35:54.195
We came across Natalia Belitrov.

35:54.239 --> 35:56.589
Doesn't look like a spy
or a politician.

35:56.632 --> 35:57.677
That's 'cause she's not.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.679
She's a graduate student
out of Belarus

35:59.722 --> 36:02.508
doing postdoc work
at a relief camp in Syria.You remember

36:02.551 --> 36:05.075
the air strike last year
that killed all those civilians?

36:05.119 --> 36:06.642
She was there?Yeah, not only that.

36:06.686 --> 36:08.166
She has proof
that Russia was responsible.

36:08.209 --> 36:10.168
She reached out
to a news producer in New York.

36:10.211 --> 36:11.734
She's trying to go public.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.475
What's she doing in New Orleans?

36:13.519 --> 36:15.216
I'm guessing, 'cause she knew
she had a target on her back,

36:15.260 --> 36:16.478
they thought it'd be safer
if they met here.

36:16.522 --> 36:17.740
PATTON:
Smart since Russia hates

36:17.784 --> 36:20.395
bad press almost as much
as dissidents.

36:20.439 --> 36:22.267
Did we get in touch
with this news producer?

36:22.310 --> 36:24.225
No, not yet. But Patton's
about to hack his phone.All right.

36:24.269 --> 36:28.273
Well, get to it. We need
to find her before Amanda does.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.931
GREGORIO:
This place is packed.

36:34.975 --> 36:37.369
Should we evacuate?

36:37.412 --> 36:38.935
Move like that
might panic Amanda.

36:38.979 --> 36:40.415
She could use the nerve agent
trying to escape.

36:40.459 --> 36:43.026
We need to find Natalia
and get her out of here quick.

36:43.070 --> 36:45.072
All right. Eyes open for Amanda.

36:45.115 --> 36:47.596
I'll start at the front.
Comms open.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.424
Let's all avoid dying horribly.

37:08.356 --> 37:09.792
I got Natalia.

37:09.836 --> 37:12.491
Sitting in the corner
near the back.

37:12.534 --> 37:14.841
Got eyes on her.

37:15.145 --> 37:17.974
Just spotted Amanda.

37:18.018 --> 37:20.368
She's headed toward
Natalia's table now.

37:24.633 --> 37:26.026
Hey, Amanda.

37:26.069 --> 37:27.027
We're leaving here right now

37:27.070 --> 37:28.550
very quietly, very calmly.

37:28.594 --> 37:29.725
No need for trouble.

37:29.769 --> 37:31.379
Get your hands off of me!

37:31.423 --> 37:33.076
Let go!Gonna walk slowly...

37:33.120 --> 37:34.208
Let me go.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.905
You got her? Okay.Yeah.

37:35.949 --> 37:37.211
AMANDA:
What are you doing?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.256
I said let me go.

37:38.299 --> 37:39.822
Leah's at the table now.

37:42.085 --> 37:43.522
Stop, Leah!Leah, do it!

37:45.045 --> 37:47.265
SEBASTIAN: Everyone out,
this way, this way, come on.

37:48.091 --> 37:49.876
Come on, go, go, go, move.

37:52.313 --> 37:54.184
Let go of the bottle.I have a mission.

37:54.228 --> 37:55.229
Okay, this way, come on.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.448
Do you even know
who that woman is?

37:56.491 --> 37:58.232
Doesn't matter.
It's my job.

37:59.712 --> 38:00.756
No, it was your father's job.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.149
You don't have
to be a part of it.

38:02.192 --> 38:05.065
Amanda says that...Amanda killed your mother.

38:05.108 --> 38:07.197
What?

38:07.241 --> 38:09.635
No, no, no.
I-I don't believe you.

38:09.678 --> 38:12.159
I'm sorry. It's the truth.

38:15.031 --> 38:17.295
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

38:17.338 --> 38:19.122
It can all be over.

38:19.166 --> 38:23.431
All you have to do is
let go of the bottle.

38:23.475 --> 38:26.260
You are gonna let
go of the bottle,

38:26.304 --> 38:29.132
then you are gonna
take me to Sam. Okay?

38:29.176 --> 38:33.267
He needs to know what
happened to his mother.

38:34.486 --> 38:37.227
You need to tell him.

38:49.936 --> 38:51.372
All right.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.287
Good. Now let's get out of here

38:53.331 --> 38:55.333
and go find your brother.

39:04.907 --> 39:08.084
Well, Leah and Sam are safe
in FBI custody.

39:08.128 --> 39:10.217
Agents are on the way
for you, too.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.262
To arrest me?No.

39:12.306 --> 39:14.308
To debrief you.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.790
What you did was heroic.

39:17.833 --> 39:20.706
Killing the only father
I ever knew?

39:20.749 --> 39:23.709
Stopping him
from hurting anyone else.

39:23.752 --> 39:26.015
Saving his other children.

39:26.059 --> 39:29.149
What happens to us now?

39:29.192 --> 39:32.326
Protective custody,
new identities.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.937
A chance at real life.

39:34.981 --> 39:37.897
You make it sound so easy.It's not,

39:37.940 --> 39:39.899
Charlie.

39:39.942 --> 39:42.205
But I know
you already know that.

39:42.249 --> 39:44.207
Leah and Sam

39:44.251 --> 39:45.992
are gonna need you.

39:47.472 --> 39:49.691
You're gonna be there for 'em.

40:01.137 --> 40:02.878
JIMMY:
Sorry I'm late.

40:04.924 --> 40:08.449
Figured if I was gonna meet
my fate, I'd meet it in style.

40:08.493 --> 40:11.365
I'm glad you're here, Jimmy.
D.A. will be, too.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.541
Showing up counts for a lot.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.151
We'll see, Dwayne.

40:15.195 --> 40:18.372
But admit it,
you thought I was gonna bail.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.853
I gave you two-to-one odds.I got your back, brother.

40:20.896 --> 40:23.159
I'll never leave you hanging.

40:23.203 --> 40:25.727
That's what family does.

40:25.771 --> 40:27.990
That one of my suits?

40:28.034 --> 40:31.124
Uh, that's something else
family does.

40:31.167 --> 40:32.734
They share.
