02:52.540 --> 02:55.583
- What's the score, Doc?
- Twins. Cutest things you ever saw.

02:55.584 --> 02:57.544
Hey, they're keeping
you busy these days.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.963
It's the desert. Gives
people wonderful ideas.

02:59.964 --> 03:02.203
- Check the ship, will you?
- You betcha.

03:35.833 --> 03:38.960
Hiya, Doc. Phone's been
ringing like crazy for you.

03:38.961 --> 03:40.753
Sheriff's half out of his mind.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.077
- Call him for me, will you, Josh?
- Yeah.

03:46.218 --> 03:48.743
- I'm ringing him, Doc.
- That's fine.

03:50.097 --> 03:53.168
- He's on, Doc.
- Thanks, Josh.

03:53.642 --> 03:55.143
Hello, Jack. What's up?

03:55.144 --> 03:57.882
Can you come over right away, Doc?

03:57.897 --> 03:59.721
I hate to bother you.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.643
I know you've been up all
night, but this is important.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.508
Okay.

04:11.160 --> 04:14.245
Doc, sure sounded
worried, didn't he?

04:14.246 --> 04:17.665
Someday, you old codger, you're going
to hear something you won't like.

04:17.666 --> 04:20.488
Are you inferring that
I was listening in?

04:20.793 --> 04:22.157
Yeah.

04:31.931 --> 04:34.933
Hi, Jack. What's all the
excitement about? Who's sick?

04:34.934 --> 04:36.684
- Nobody.
- Huh?

04:36.685 --> 04:39.395
The boys found a man near
the highway this morning.

04:39.396 --> 04:41.091
- Run over?
- No.

04:41.273 --> 04:43.733
- Well, then?
- That's why I called you, Doc.

04:43.734 --> 04:46.819
- What's it look like?
- Like nothing I've ever seen before.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.029
Who is it?

04:48.030 --> 04:52.809
Well, he has the same general build
as Eric Jacobs, but I'm not sure.

04:53.077 --> 04:54.327
I don't follow you.

04:54.328 --> 04:57.101
There's something about his
face says he's Jacobs...

04:57.498 --> 04:58.978
but maybe he ain't.

04:59.792 --> 05:01.451
Look, Jack, I'm lost.

05:01.627 --> 05:03.419
You remember Jacobs, don't you?

05:03.420 --> 05:06.297
Yeah, he's the biologist.
Works for Prof. Deemer.

05:06.298 --> 05:07.882
Met him a couple of years ago.

05:07.883 --> 05:11.168
He's over at the undertaker's.
You'd better have a look.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.307
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Charlie.

05:16.308 --> 05:18.268
I phoned Deemer right away.

05:18.269 --> 05:20.645
He said he'd be over
to see if this is him.

05:20.646 --> 05:22.188
You know Deemer, don't you?

05:22.189 --> 05:25.567
Yeah. When I opened my office I
went out to pay my respects.

05:25.568 --> 05:27.026
He was polite enough...

05:27.027 --> 05:29.779
but I had the feeling I wasn't
welcome, so I never went back.

05:29.780 --> 05:32.732
Some of these big brains
never learnt manners.

05:34.869 --> 05:36.369
Here he is, Barney.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.912
- Hi, Doc.
- Hello, Barney.

05:37.913 --> 05:40.402
You figure this one
out and you're good.

06:04.190 --> 06:06.762
Now you know why I'm not sure.

06:07.067 --> 06:10.850
That's not Jacobs. This man has
had the disease for years.

06:11.447 --> 06:14.115
I saw Jacobs last month.
He looked okay then.

06:14.116 --> 06:16.309
They're in the back
room, Professor.

06:28.881 --> 06:30.409
It's Eric, all right.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.666
He was my friend for 30 years.

06:36.055 --> 06:38.128
You better come outside, Professor.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.414
Yes.

06:49.485 --> 06:50.944
- You all through in there?
- Yeah.

06:50.945 --> 06:53.071
Leave us alone for a
minute, will you, Barney?

06:53.072 --> 06:54.766
Yeah, sure.

06:57.451 --> 07:00.438
Professor, I have to
know all about it.

07:00.871 --> 07:03.748
Why he looks that way,
why he was missing.

07:03.749 --> 07:05.208
Sheriff, have you ever watched...

07:05.209 --> 07:08.410
a friend dying before your eyes
and not been able to help?

07:09.088 --> 07:10.663
That's the worst of it.

07:12.091 --> 07:13.536
Being helpless.

07:16.428 --> 07:18.805
It's particularly tough
when you're a physician...

07:18.806 --> 07:20.515
and you know what's wrong with him.

07:20.516 --> 07:24.185
And there isn't a single solitary
thing you or anyone else can do.

07:24.186 --> 07:27.355
When I saw the body,
I though it was acromegalia.

07:27.356 --> 07:28.773
But that's not possible.

07:28.774 --> 07:30.385
Acromegalia?

07:30.776 --> 07:33.194
The pituitary gland
goes haywire, Jack.

07:33.195 --> 07:35.933
It distorts the face,
neck, hands, and feet.

07:36.615 --> 07:39.389
I met Jacobs a couple of
years ago at your place.

07:39.660 --> 07:43.276
The sheriff saw him about a month
ago. He looked normal then.

07:43.789 --> 07:45.733
It is acromegalia.

07:48.419 --> 07:51.087
But in every case
I've ever heard of...

07:51.088 --> 07:53.446
it's taken years to
produce the deformity.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.745
I know.

07:55.968 --> 07:59.454
The history of medicine is
the history of the unusual.

08:00.347 --> 08:03.349
Perhaps Eric had been ill
for years. Who knows?

08:03.350 --> 08:07.270
But it was only four days ago that he
began to complain of muscular pains.

08:07.271 --> 08:10.342
Neither of us thought
too much about it.

08:10.399 --> 08:13.351
These things happen
as you grow older.

08:14.111 --> 08:17.265
And the next morning he began to...

08:17.656 --> 08:19.232
To change.

08:20.034 --> 08:22.911
Maybe we'd better do an
autopsy just to make sure.

08:22.912 --> 08:24.746
I don't think that'll be necessary.

08:24.747 --> 08:27.248
I was in attendance, and I
signed the death certificate.

08:27.249 --> 08:28.480
I see.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.783
How come we found
him on the desert?

08:31.712 --> 08:34.380
Dr. Jacobs became
delirious last night.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.341
Broke out of the house
and ran into the desert.

08:36.342 --> 08:40.053
Are you certain he hadn't complained
of anything before that time?

08:40.054 --> 08:42.875
There's nothing I can add
to what I've already said.

08:43.432 --> 08:46.467
Eric had no family. I'll
arrange for the funeral.

08:47.353 --> 08:49.354
Thank you for calling
me so promptly.

08:49.355 --> 08:51.678
- Goodbye, Dr. Hastings.
- Professor.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.817
Acromegalia.

08:54.818 --> 08:56.861
- You heard the man.
- I sure did.

08:56.862 --> 09:00.406
A young fellow like you can't stack
what he knows against the professor.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.784
The trouble is, Doc, you
hate to admit you're wrong.

09:02.785 --> 09:06.021
We all make mistakes, Jack.
This isn't one of mine.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.480
Hello.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.066
There we go.

12:39.752 --> 12:42.621
- Paul!
- Eric is dead. Do you hear me?

12:46.217 --> 12:48.374
There's just you and me...

12:49.053 --> 12:51.660
and we're going to die, too.

12:52.264 --> 12:54.623
No, Paul! Keep away from me!

12:54.850 --> 12:57.007
I'm trying to help you. Paul!

16:02.121 --> 16:04.527
Coco, you startled me.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.489
So you escaped the fire?

16:07.751 --> 16:09.825
Let me see those paws.

16:10.963 --> 16:14.090
I'll have to do something
about those burns, won't I?

16:14.091 --> 16:15.536
Come on, Coco.

16:33.319 --> 16:35.695
You've got that look like
you swallowed the canary.

16:35.696 --> 16:36.946
Not at all.

16:36.947 --> 16:41.284
If there's anything a man hates it's to be
told he's wrong when he knows he's right.

16:41.285 --> 16:44.023
I knew Deemer had burnt your tail.

16:44.038 --> 16:47.108
Listen, I'm just a country
doctor, but I know what I know.

16:47.333 --> 16:51.044
And I know acromegalia doesn't turn
up in four days out of left field.

16:51.045 --> 16:52.212
So?

16:52.213 --> 16:55.579
So I went to the medical library
in Phoenix and read up on it.

16:55.674 --> 16:58.510
There wasn't one single recorded
case in medical history...

16:58.511 --> 17:01.804
where a malformation developed as
fast as Deemer said Jacobs' did.

17:01.805 --> 17:04.923
- You mean he was lying to us?
- I don't know.

17:06.644 --> 17:09.979
But I'd like to know why he was
in such a hurry to bury Jacobs...

17:09.980 --> 17:12.339
and why he didn't want
me to do an autopsy.

17:12.483 --> 17:16.218
The man's an M.D. Like you.
He's entitled to his opinion.

17:16.278 --> 17:19.681
Or do you want me to charge him
with confusing a country doctor?

17:20.115 --> 17:23.284
There's nothing like the safety
of prestige, is there, Sheriff?

17:23.285 --> 17:24.618
Let's skip it.

17:24.619 --> 17:26.079
Everything's clean and legal...

17:26.079 --> 17:28.831
and I wouldn't want you to stick
your neck out for anything.

17:28.832 --> 17:30.208
What do you want me to do?

17:30.209 --> 17:32.919
Pinch him because I don't like
the way he parts his hair?

17:32.920 --> 17:35.171
Have you ever asked yourself
what Deemer and Jacobs...

17:35.172 --> 17:36.631
were working on in their lab?

17:36.632 --> 17:40.331
No, and I don't intend to jimmy
open a window to find out, either.

17:41.303 --> 17:43.930
Deemer's speciality
is nutrient biology.

17:43.931 --> 17:46.124
Jacobs is a leader
in the same field.

17:46.183 --> 17:48.643
Now when two big shots
like that get together...

17:48.644 --> 17:51.646
and hole up in the desert,
20 miles from civilization...

17:51.647 --> 17:53.815
I'd say they might be
working on something...

17:53.816 --> 17:56.554
they're not too anxious
to talk about.

17:58.487 --> 18:02.186
You think whatever they might be doing
ties in with what killed Jacobs?

18:02.324 --> 18:04.232
I wish I knew.

18:05.494 --> 18:06.939
Oh, oh.

18:07.496 --> 18:09.605
Joe Burch is on the warpath again.

18:09.707 --> 18:13.739
- What'd you do this time?
- I forgot to tell him about Jacobs.

18:15.588 --> 18:19.048
Well, good day, my very,
very good friends.

18:19.049 --> 18:20.758
A fine pair you turned out to be.

18:20.759 --> 18:22.468
I practically had the
paper put to bed...

18:22.469 --> 18:24.387
when I found out about
Jacobs by accident.

18:24.388 --> 18:27.432
Well, I'm sorry, Joe. It slipped my mind.
What do you want to know?

18:27.433 --> 18:29.142
Only what I haven't
found out for myself.

18:29.143 --> 18:31.769
I sneaked a look at the death
certificate over at Barney's.

18:31.770 --> 18:34.343
Got the personal dope on
him out of Who's Who.

18:34.481 --> 18:37.433
How often does this
acromegalia occur, Doc?

18:37.526 --> 18:40.862
Not very. First time I've
seen it, as a matter of fact.

18:40.863 --> 18:44.017
My dictionary says it's chronic,
it doesn't mention death.

18:44.116 --> 18:47.400
Well, death doesn't usually
come from the disease itself.

18:47.411 --> 18:49.162
It's caused by suffocation.

18:49.163 --> 18:50.987
What do you mean, suffocation?

18:51.040 --> 18:54.667
The tongue becomes enlarged.
The throat, the thorax, the heart...

18:54.668 --> 18:56.825
everything gets
pushed out of place.

18:58.130 --> 19:00.548
What do you think Deemer's
been working on out there?

19:00.549 --> 19:02.509
That I'd like to know.

19:02.510 --> 19:06.387
I'll hop out with Ridley, grab a couple
of pictures, and see what I can find out.

19:06.388 --> 19:07.722
By the way, Doc...

19:07.723 --> 19:11.518
how long had Jacobs been dead when our
friend here remembered to call you?

19:11.519 --> 19:14.270
- Will you lay off?
- Eight or ten hours.

19:14.271 --> 19:16.731
Thanks, Doc. I'll be sure
to spell your name right.

19:16.732 --> 19:18.900
As for your friend, it
might just slip my mind...

19:18.901 --> 19:21.936
to support him the next time
he comes up for election.

19:22.446 --> 19:25.849
Say, that's a good idea, Jack.
Him going out to Deemer's.

19:26.116 --> 19:29.401
Joe will get him so riled up with
questions, he may take to me.

19:43.259 --> 19:46.845
If you go into the hotel, miss, they'll
tell you the best way to get there.

19:46.846 --> 19:48.504
Thank you.

19:59.900 --> 20:03.444
I wonder if you might tell me the best
way to get out to the Deemer place?

20:03.445 --> 20:05.780
- It's about...
- I know where it is.

20:05.781 --> 20:07.824
Is there a bus or cab available?

20:07.825 --> 20:11.476
Well, yes, but there won't be any
buses through anymore today.

20:12.121 --> 20:13.955
Then would you mind
calling a cab for me?

20:13.956 --> 20:16.861
I wouldn't mind it a bit.
But it wouldn't do no good.

20:16.876 --> 20:19.252
Because Jasper,
you see, it's his cab.

20:19.253 --> 20:22.573
He's out at the Bar Six and won't
be back for a couple of hours.

20:23.507 --> 20:25.118
Maybe longer.

20:25.676 --> 20:27.667
Well, what'll I do?

20:28.137 --> 20:30.828
Sit down and wait.
That's all you can do.

20:31.891 --> 20:33.466
Thank you.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.328
You ain't come through
here before, have you?

20:53.329 --> 20:54.857
No.

20:55.623 --> 20:57.732
Didn't think I'd seen you.

20:58.584 --> 21:01.156
You any kin to this man, Deemer?

21:01.629 --> 21:03.129
No, I'm not.

21:03.130 --> 21:05.786
He any kin to you? Oh, no.

21:08.052 --> 21:10.261
- I don't suppose that...
- I doubt it.

21:10.262 --> 21:11.707
Me, too.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.856
Josh, I'm expecting a
call from Dan Simon.

21:21.857 --> 21:23.691
Switch it to the Deemer
place, will you?

21:23.692 --> 21:25.151
You going out there?

21:25.152 --> 21:27.760
- Just leaving.
- Take her with you.

21:28.197 --> 21:30.990
Well, you see, I was asking
how to get out there, but...

21:30.991 --> 21:32.867
Well, I wouldn't want
to impose on you.

21:32.868 --> 21:34.610
He won't mind.

21:35.329 --> 21:37.205
No, I'd be glad to drive you.

21:37.206 --> 21:39.979
- Well, if you're sure.
- Are these yours?

21:40.668 --> 21:41.899
Hey.

21:42.211 --> 21:44.984
Ain't you two going to
introduce yourselves?

21:46.090 --> 21:47.321
- No.
- No.

21:51.804 --> 21:54.162
Getting to be a fast world.

22:01.105 --> 22:02.480
Think it's about time?

22:02.481 --> 22:05.817
- Dr. Matt Hastings.
- Stephanie Clayton. "Steve."

22:05.818 --> 22:07.402
I like Steve.

22:07.403 --> 22:10.154
I'm really indebted to you,
Dr. Hastings, for this ride.

22:10.155 --> 22:12.824
Or rather, I'm indebted
to your friend Josh.

22:12.825 --> 22:14.305
So am I.

22:14.952 --> 22:19.038
I guess it's none of my business asking why
you're going out to Deemer's place, but...

22:19.039 --> 22:20.290
Why not?

22:20.291 --> 22:22.500
I'm doing graduate work in biology.

22:22.501 --> 22:24.610
The professor teaches
it, or he did.

22:24.879 --> 22:26.588
I knew it would happen.

22:26.589 --> 22:30.158
Give women the vote and what
do you get? Lady scientists.

22:30.634 --> 22:32.719
Well, student so far.

22:32.720 --> 22:36.556
You see, I wrote a paper on the nutritional
aspects of expanding populations...

22:36.557 --> 22:39.601
and Prof. Jacobs read it and
offered me a job for the summer.

22:39.602 --> 22:41.519
How about a place to live?

22:41.520 --> 22:44.439
There are a couple of nice
boarding houses in Desert Rock.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.983
- Cost less than a hotel.
- Well, no.

22:46.984 --> 22:48.860
I'm going to stay
at the professor's.

22:48.861 --> 22:50.862
You see, it's all
part of my contract.

22:50.863 --> 22:54.847
I'll be laboratory technician,
cook, student. The whole works.

22:55.159 --> 22:56.367
I see.

22:56.368 --> 22:58.244
Well, it's one way of
earning a master's.

22:58.245 --> 23:02.360
And it's worth it working with
people like Deemer and Prof. Jacobs.

23:04.335 --> 23:08.034
- How well did you know Eric Jacobs?
- I've never met him.

23:08.088 --> 23:11.408
He just read the paper and
liked it, and that was that.

23:12.510 --> 23:14.120
He's dead.

23:14.386 --> 23:16.246
Died yesterday morning.

23:17.014 --> 23:18.459
How?

23:19.141 --> 23:21.666
Glandular condition
called acromegalia.

23:22.978 --> 23:26.064
Acromegalia? Isn't that
a very rare disease?

23:26.065 --> 23:27.676
Extremely.

23:28.025 --> 23:29.719
Are you sure it was that?

23:31.070 --> 23:34.520
No, I'm not sure at all.

24:01.058 --> 24:03.630
He has a wonderful lab here.
One of the best.

24:07.064 --> 24:09.065
Looks like nobody's home.

24:09.066 --> 24:12.137
There must be someone. That's
Joe Burch's car over there.

24:14.864 --> 24:16.226
Might as well.

24:18.659 --> 24:22.537
The electric panel shorted.

24:22.538 --> 24:25.063
And, well, you can
see for yourself.

24:25.249 --> 24:27.774
You estimated the amount
of damage yet, Professor?

24:28.294 --> 24:32.922
The greatest damage, of course, was
to the work that was destroyed.

24:32.923 --> 24:34.299
Let's get back to Jacobs.

24:34.300 --> 24:36.658
- Why did he leave...
- I've told you all there is.

24:36.677 --> 24:38.704
Will you gentlemen excuse me?

24:39.513 --> 24:41.264
One more picture.

24:41.265 --> 24:43.391
- Pat the monkey, Professor.
- I said that was all.

24:43.392 --> 24:45.226
I think that ought
to be enough, Joe.

24:45.227 --> 24:48.646
- Professor's had a rough couple of days.
- Yes. Thank you, Dr. Hastings.

24:48.647 --> 24:52.108
Thanks for the story, Professor.
I didn't mean to add to your troubles.

24:52.109 --> 24:53.359
Come on, Ridley.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.387
- See you later, Matt.
- See you, Joe.

25:01.118 --> 25:03.441
I thought I'd never
get rid of them.

25:03.579 --> 25:05.855
You must forgive an old man.

25:06.332 --> 25:09.375
- Have I met you before, miss?
- No.

25:09.376 --> 25:13.379
This is Stephanie Clayton. It seems
Prof. Jacobs wrote for an assistant.

25:13.380 --> 25:16.581
- She's it.
- Yes, Eric told me you were coming.

25:17.092 --> 25:20.578
But I didn't expect to see a
biologist that looked like you.

25:20.846 --> 25:23.139
That was intended as a compliment.

25:23.140 --> 25:26.923
- I'm afraid I've gotten a bit rusty.
- Well, thank you, sir.

25:27.061 --> 25:30.897
Well, I don't know that you'll want to
stay on with all that has happened...

25:30.898 --> 25:32.889
You're welcome to, of course.

25:32.983 --> 25:34.359
But Eric...

25:34.360 --> 25:37.596
I know. Dr. Hastings
told me on the way out.

25:37.863 --> 25:39.178
I see.

25:39.740 --> 25:43.493
Well, with Eric gone, I'm alone.

25:43.494 --> 25:45.161
I'm sure I can be of service.

25:45.162 --> 25:47.580
I mean, if you're going to
continue with your work.

25:47.581 --> 25:52.242
Yes, indeed. For Eric's
sake, if nothing else.

25:52.336 --> 25:54.879
Wasn't Paul Lund working
with you, Prof. Deemer?

25:54.880 --> 25:56.047
Paul...

25:56.048 --> 25:57.882
Yes, he was studying
for his doctorate...

25:57.883 --> 25:59.050
when I was a freshman.

25:59.051 --> 26:02.387
- I'd heard he came here.
- Yes, of course.

26:02.388 --> 26:05.849
Paul Lund. No, he's
not with us anymore.

26:05.850 --> 26:08.434
Well, come now, Miss Clayton.
Let me show you my lab.

26:08.435 --> 26:11.921
- Are you interested at all, Doctor?
- Yes, of course.

26:12.273 --> 26:15.046
I've put all I own into this.

26:15.234 --> 26:16.809
It's my life.

26:17.319 --> 26:20.437
Everything that I have
and care for is here.

26:21.407 --> 26:24.561
Unfortunately, part of
it has been destroyed.

26:25.077 --> 26:26.440
I see.

26:26.996 --> 26:29.080
What's in the vial, Professor?

26:29.081 --> 26:31.570
- A nutrient.
- You mean a synthetic?

26:31.792 --> 26:34.744
A completely nonorganic
food concentrate.

26:35.421 --> 26:38.871
Medicine has lengthened the life
span, and people live longer.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.918
But the food supply
remains fairly static.

26:43.596 --> 26:48.292
World population is increasing at
the rate of 25 million a year.

26:50.144 --> 26:52.218
An overcrowded world.

26:52.688 --> 26:55.177
That means not enough to eat.

26:55.274 --> 26:59.222
The disease of hunger, like most
diseases, well, it spreads.

26:59.528 --> 27:02.266
There are 2 billion people
in the world today.

27:02.615 --> 27:05.021
In 1975 there will be 3 billion.

27:05.242 --> 27:09.487
In the year 2000, there will
be 3 billion 625 million.

27:10.539 --> 27:14.292
The world may not be able to produce
enough food to feed all these people.

27:14.293 --> 27:18.954
Now perhaps you'll understand what
an inexpensive nutrient will mean.

27:19.965 --> 27:22.917
Well, not many of us look that
far into the future, sir.

27:23.594 --> 27:25.668
Our business is the future.

27:25.846 --> 27:28.139
No man can do it on
his own, of course.

27:28.140 --> 27:31.258
You don't pull it out of your
hat like a magician's rabbit.

27:31.936 --> 27:36.762
Well, you build on what hundreds
of others have learnt before you.

27:37.316 --> 27:40.652
I thought that synthesis was
impossible without a bonding agent...

27:40.653 --> 27:42.477
to hold everything together.

27:43.155 --> 27:45.949
And we use the simplest
of all: The atom.

27:45.950 --> 27:47.525
Let me show you.

27:56.377 --> 27:59.780
- That's an isotope, isn't it?
- A radioactive isotope.

28:00.214 --> 28:01.548
Ammoniac.

28:01.549 --> 28:05.593
- And that's what binds your solution?
- Binds it and triggers it.

28:05.594 --> 28:09.377
Using it, Eric's dream and mine
may be a reality before...

28:11.183 --> 28:12.414
Excuse me.

28:17.606 --> 28:18.921
Hello?

28:20.359 --> 28:21.722
Yes.

28:23.153 --> 28:24.598
It's for you, Doctor.

28:26.198 --> 28:27.679
Thank you.

28:29.910 --> 28:32.815
Hello? Hi, Josh.

28:33.372 --> 28:34.581
Of course.

28:34.582 --> 28:37.355
Call her back. Tell her I'll
stop by on my way home.

28:37.459 --> 28:38.822
Bye.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.780
Sorry to break this up.

28:42.298 --> 28:43.798
Thanks for the tour, Professor.

28:43.799 --> 28:45.550
Maybe one of these days
you'll invite me back.

28:45.551 --> 28:47.375
Why, yes, of course.

28:48.304 --> 28:50.081
Professor, I...

28:50.639 --> 28:54.309
I'm still puzzled by the speed with
which Jacobs' malformation developed.

28:54.310 --> 28:55.643
Can you explain it?

28:55.644 --> 28:57.884
Eric is dead and he shouldn't be.

28:57.980 --> 29:00.753
But the cause was
acromegalia. Nothing else.

29:01.275 --> 29:04.013
It seems such a deviation
from the classic cases.

29:04.236 --> 29:08.019
You're being very diplomatic, Doctor.
Why don't you speak up?

29:08.574 --> 29:12.059
Don't you think, sir, this
time you might be wrong?

29:12.286 --> 29:13.861
In this case, no.

29:14.121 --> 29:16.414
You want to do an
autopsy. Why don't you?

29:16.415 --> 29:18.987
- Well, you objected.
- I was upset.

29:19.251 --> 29:22.903
Eric was not only my colleague,
he was my closest friend.

29:23.255 --> 29:26.540
- You have my permission.
- Well, thank you, sir.

29:26.550 --> 29:28.593
I'll let you know what I find.

29:28.594 --> 29:31.166
And please, don't forget
to invite me back?

29:33.307 --> 29:36.424
- Well, now I'll show you to your quarters.
- All right.

29:43.943 --> 29:46.277
- That you, Jack?
- How're you coming?

29:46.278 --> 29:48.435
Be right with you.

30:06.674 --> 30:08.202
What you got?

30:08.425 --> 30:11.116
I'll give it to you
fast, Jack. Nothing.

30:11.220 --> 30:14.337
Nothing? You mean the
professor was right?

30:14.849 --> 30:16.516
Couldn't have been more right.

30:16.517 --> 30:17.809
Well, how do you like that?

30:17.810 --> 30:21.437
You make a big thing out of it, show
Deemer up for maybe a murderer and then...

30:21.438 --> 30:23.523
You want me to go ahead
with the interment, Jack?

30:23.524 --> 30:27.591
You might as well before this amateur
gumshoe gets any more bright ideas.

30:28.028 --> 30:29.806
The case is closed.

30:31.282 --> 30:34.851
And the next time I need a doctor,
I'll call one in from Phoenix.

30:35.327 --> 30:38.079
You know, I don't think Jack's
too happy about all this.

30:38.080 --> 30:40.023
I don't blame him.

30:41.917 --> 30:44.110
But I still can't figure it out.

30:48.507 --> 30:50.949
Slowly, slow.

30:52.678 --> 30:53.970
That's good.

30:53.971 --> 30:56.923
Take your time, Steve,
take your time.

30:56.932 --> 30:59.374
We have nothing except time.

30:59.476 --> 31:01.918
And we won't have that
if we make a mistake.

31:02.271 --> 31:03.550
There.

31:03.981 --> 31:06.304
- Am I doing all right, Professor?
- Fine!

31:06.609 --> 31:09.478
Now lift the lid onto the vial.

31:12.031 --> 31:13.725
Easy.

31:14.867 --> 31:18.317
That's it. Now lift up
the graduated glass...

31:20.539 --> 31:22.946
and put it in the access chamber.

31:26.921 --> 31:28.829
Well done, Steve.

31:29.006 --> 31:31.115
Now lift up the chamber.

31:34.595 --> 31:36.040
That's it.

31:37.515 --> 31:40.475
Now we'll take this
into the dry box...

31:40.476 --> 31:43.297
where we can handle it safely.

31:59.495 --> 32:01.652
You're getting quite
expert at this.

32:02.498 --> 32:04.832
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

32:04.833 --> 32:07.359
Now let's see how we make out.

32:08.712 --> 32:13.216
It's one thing to develop a formula
on paper, another to make it work.

32:13.217 --> 32:17.711
So far we've found an almost consistent
instability in the material.

32:18.639 --> 32:21.683
One batch of nutrient varies
sharply from the next.

32:21.684 --> 32:24.007
What do you want to
try it on this time?

32:24.436 --> 32:26.344
One of the baby rats?

32:47.376 --> 32:48.821
Okay.

32:51.088 --> 32:53.590
How long before we know
anything, Professor?

32:53.591 --> 32:57.124
Well, there have been times when
the instability has caused death.

32:59.096 --> 33:01.123
I meant, if it works.

33:01.348 --> 33:02.924
Let me show you.

33:05.311 --> 33:07.634
- You see that rabbit?
- Yes.

33:08.147 --> 33:10.423
How old would you say he was?

33:10.482 --> 33:12.177
Four months.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.175
Look at the chart.

33:15.362 --> 33:17.057
Six days!

33:18.699 --> 33:19.991
Is it normal?

33:19.992 --> 33:23.453
I ran a reflex test on him after
you went to bed last night.

33:23.454 --> 33:25.496
The only difference between
him and the others...

33:25.497 --> 33:28.416
is that he's healthier
and stronger.

33:28.417 --> 33:31.211
All the same, we mustn't
be in too much of a hurry.

33:31.212 --> 33:34.199
We've got to lick this
problem of instability.

33:34.423 --> 33:39.166
Once we can control that, we're ready
for the ultimate test: On humans.

33:40.638 --> 33:42.795
There mustn't be a
mistake this time.

33:51.023 --> 33:53.858
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- All right, Steve.

33:53.859 --> 33:56.528
Science is science, but a
girl must get her hair done.

33:56.529 --> 33:59.197
You'd better hurry though, if
you're going to catch that bus.

33:59.198 --> 34:01.407
- It only stops on signal, you know.
- I know.

34:01.408 --> 34:03.159
- Anything I can get for you?
- No, thanks.

34:03.160 --> 34:05.203
We'll run those tissue
tests when you come back.

34:05.204 --> 34:07.610
- Right.
- Have fun.

34:21.679 --> 34:24.722
Have the prescription refilled and be
sure she takes it after every meal.

34:24.723 --> 34:28.393
Okay, Doc, but you know women.
Mary will just let it sit on the shelf.

34:28.393 --> 34:30.853
Yeah, but she'll feel better
knowing it's there, won't she?

34:30.855 --> 34:32.105
Yeah, I suppose so.

34:32.106 --> 34:34.607
Say, when are you and me flying
out for some more fishing?

34:34.608 --> 34:37.110
- It's been four or five weeks since...
- Excuse me, Jim.

34:37.110 --> 34:38.342
Steve!

34:40.364 --> 34:42.936
- Carry your books, miss?
- Thanks!

34:42.992 --> 34:45.563
I haven't been walked to
school in a long time.

34:45.578 --> 34:47.871
Hey, you dress up our
town very nicely.

34:47.871 --> 34:49.914
If you don't look out, the
Chamber of Commerce...

34:49.915 --> 34:53.947
is going to list you in their
publicity with the local attractions.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.913
Say, do you have to go right back?

34:57.548 --> 34:58.756
No.

34:58.757 --> 35:01.911
- Good, let's skip school.
- All right.

35:09.351 --> 35:11.378
It's like an oasis.

35:11.645 --> 35:14.419
- I bring all my patients here.
- I'll bet.

35:14.607 --> 35:16.799
- How's this?
- Fine.

35:24.783 --> 35:26.228
Not now, thanks.

35:27.828 --> 35:29.662
How are you getting
along with Deemer?

35:29.663 --> 35:31.664
Half the time he doesn't
know I'm there...

35:31.665 --> 35:34.334
and the other half he's
worried I'll make a mistake.

35:34.335 --> 35:36.907
- He's quite a guy, I guess.
- Yes.

35:38.214 --> 35:42.458
Has he said anything more about
that assistant that left?

35:42.593 --> 35:43.991
No.

35:44.428 --> 35:46.513
How's the nutrient coming along?

35:46.514 --> 35:49.631
Well, this is the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

35:49.642 --> 35:52.961
How long does it take an ordinary
rabbit to reach full growth?

35:53.062 --> 35:55.855
I don't know. Four or
five months, I guess.

35:55.856 --> 35:58.927
He has one there that's
reached maturity in six days.

35:59.109 --> 35:59.845
Six days?

35:59.871 --> 36:02.787
I know it sounds
unbelievable, but it's true.

36:02.788 --> 36:04.656
It's still so new
and unpredictable.

36:04.657 --> 36:07.116
There are all sorts of things
to take into account...

36:07.117 --> 36:09.869
before we can even think of
experimenting on humans.

36:09.870 --> 36:14.115
Some of the nutrient, when
unstable, has even been deadly.

36:14.583 --> 36:18.567
But we do know that it's kept animals
alive that have been fed nothing else.

36:18.921 --> 36:21.840
If I stay here much longer
I'm going to miss my bus.

36:21.841 --> 36:24.717
Who can ask for a better opening?
I'm at your service, miss.

36:24.718 --> 36:27.011
Are you sure your
patients can spare you?

36:27.012 --> 36:29.538
I'm such a good doctor,
they never get sick.

36:30.057 --> 36:32.131
- Come on. Let's go.
- All right.

36:43.487 --> 36:45.405
No wonder you love the desert.

36:45.406 --> 36:47.349
It's so beautiful.

36:48.659 --> 36:52.120
Everything that ever walked or
crawled on the face of the earth...

36:52.121 --> 36:53.913
swum the depths of the ocean...

36:53.914 --> 36:56.866
soared through the sky has
left its imprint here.

36:58.794 --> 37:00.128
Look.

37:00.129 --> 37:02.505
Did you ever wonder what
piled them up like that?

37:02.506 --> 37:04.663
Wind? Water? What?

37:04.925 --> 37:08.303
I've never seen anything
quite like it. Can we stop?

37:08.304 --> 37:09.702
Sure.

37:48.511 --> 37:50.952
All this was once an
ocean, wasn't it?

37:51.847 --> 37:54.918
You can still find seashells
if you keep your eyes open.

37:55.226 --> 37:57.086
- What's that?
- I...

37:58.020 --> 38:02.004
- There he is.
- It scared me.

38:02.399 --> 38:05.443
I'm beginning to see now
why you love it here.

38:05.444 --> 38:07.055
Catching, huh?

38:08.030 --> 38:10.686
I think I'll have
that cigarette now.

38:15.371 --> 38:16.981
Thank you.

38:23.420 --> 38:26.256
You know, it must look out
of this world from the air.

38:26.257 --> 38:29.327
- I'll show it to you sometime.
- Will you really?

38:29.677 --> 38:31.219
What does it look like?

38:31.220 --> 38:33.958
Like something from another life.

38:34.765 --> 38:38.251
Serene, quiet,
yet strangely evil...

38:38.644 --> 38:40.967
as if it were hiding
its secret from man.

38:42.940 --> 38:46.359
You make it sound so creepy.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.220
The unknown always is.

39:28.194 --> 39:31.597
- Whatever could have started it?
- I don't know.

39:32.948 --> 39:37.228
Well, I think I've had enough of
the unknown for one afternoon.

40:11.028 --> 40:13.933
Something must have started it.

40:15.324 --> 40:17.825
You can't second-guess the desert.

40:17.826 --> 40:22.320
Rocks that have stayed for
1,000 years, they just move.

40:22.748 --> 40:24.941
There's no figuring it.

40:33.717 --> 40:37.220
Well, the bus would have gotten me here
sooner, but I certainly enjoyed it.

40:37.221 --> 40:40.473
- Give my best to the rabbits.
- Would you like to see them?

40:40.474 --> 40:42.583
Now you're talking.

41:01.036 --> 41:03.525
You can put them right there.

41:09.128 --> 41:12.714
It's funny he's not here.
Maybe he's resting.

41:12.715 --> 41:15.702
- Do I get the guided tour?
- Follow me.

41:20.848 --> 41:23.503
It wasn't like that when I left!

41:24.226 --> 41:26.603
Are you sure it's the same one?

41:26.604 --> 41:28.084
Yes.

41:28.606 --> 41:32.257
We injected a baby rat this
morning. Let's take a look at it.

41:36.947 --> 41:39.638
- This morning?
- It was a baby.

41:39.867 --> 41:42.702
Matt, I tell you, this
morning it was a baby.

41:42.703 --> 41:45.622
And it doubled in
size in a few hours?

41:45.623 --> 41:47.946
Matt, you do believe me?

41:48.042 --> 41:49.736
Of course I do.

41:57.301 --> 41:58.593
Hello?

41:58.594 --> 42:00.621
Yes, he's here. Just a minute.

42:00.679 --> 42:02.587
It's your office.

42:03.641 --> 42:06.332
Thanks. Hello?

42:07.394 --> 42:09.053
Yeah, Josh.

42:10.064 --> 42:13.525
I'll stop by on my way
home. Thanks. Bye.

42:13.526 --> 42:15.303
I've got to go.

42:15.402 --> 42:17.779
That's one of the penalties
of being a doctor.

42:17.780 --> 42:20.490
I never seem to find time
to finish a conversation.

42:20.491 --> 42:22.367
What do you make of that baby rat?

42:22.368 --> 42:24.062
I don't know.

42:24.119 --> 42:25.995
Freaks of any kind
give me the willies.

42:25.996 --> 42:28.915
Well, I've heard of giantism, but
I've never seen it produced.

42:28.916 --> 42:31.709
Why don't you have Deemer ask
me out in the next day or so.

42:31.710 --> 42:34.170
- I'd like to discuss it with him.
- I will.

42:34.171 --> 42:37.215
Besides, it'll give me a
chance to see you again.

42:37.216 --> 42:38.842
Or don't I need an excuse?

42:38.843 --> 42:41.878
- Now, what do you think?
- I'll call you.

42:51.981 --> 42:54.983
My laboratory is not open to
the public, Miss Clayton.

42:54.984 --> 42:58.027
Explain why you brought
Dr. Hastings here.

42:58.028 --> 43:00.898
- Sir?
- Dr. Hastings.

43:01.365 --> 43:04.617
Will you please explain
why you brought him here?

43:04.618 --> 43:08.288
He's very interested in your work,
sir, and I thought it'd be all...

43:08.289 --> 43:11.875
Were you in the habit of conducting
tours at Owens University?

43:11.876 --> 43:13.668
No, sir, but I thought it would...

43:13.669 --> 43:16.504
Bringing him here was a
breach of my trust in you.

43:16.505 --> 43:20.842
Experimental research is always
confidential be it here or anywhere else.

43:20.843 --> 43:23.553
You didn't tell me
it was confidential.

43:23.554 --> 43:25.877
I didn't think I'd need to.

43:26.140 --> 43:27.849
Professor, your face.

43:27.850 --> 43:31.217
- That will be enough, Miss Clayton.
- Yes, sir.

45:08.242 --> 45:11.870
- Boy, you got nerves. Simmer down.
- Where did you come from?

45:11.871 --> 45:15.456
I was on my way to old Andy
Andersen's when I saw your car.

45:15.457 --> 45:17.292
What are you doing here?

45:17.293 --> 45:19.711
There was a landslide
an hour or so ago.

45:19.712 --> 45:22.881
- Came back to see what caused it.
- This is one of those days.

45:22.882 --> 45:25.633
Old Andy called me in a sweat
and said to come a running.

45:25.634 --> 45:27.677
Couldn't figure out what
he was yakking about...

45:27.678 --> 45:30.221
but it seems like something
was eating his cattle.

45:30.222 --> 45:32.581
- Eating them?
- Say...

45:32.808 --> 45:35.935
He had sunstroke a couple of
years back. You don't suppose...

45:35.936 --> 45:40.273
No, there must be something to it.
Said he had a stack of bones to show me.

45:40.274 --> 45:42.859
You wouldn't like to
come along, would you?

45:42.860 --> 45:45.778
You still trust my judgement
after the Jacobs business?

45:45.779 --> 45:49.183
I ain't looking for medical
advice, Doc. Just company.

46:02.296 --> 46:04.654
Glad you finally got here, Sheriff.

46:05.341 --> 46:07.217
Hi, Doc. Didn't expect to see you.

46:07.218 --> 46:10.220
Hi, Andy. Jack met me on the way.
Told me you've been having trouble.

46:10.221 --> 46:13.723
- Yeah, darndest thing ever happened.
- Where's what we came for?

46:13.724 --> 46:15.252
Let's go.

46:32.034 --> 46:33.910
I never saw anything like it.

46:33.911 --> 46:36.704
No footprints, no blood,
no sign of struggle.

46:36.705 --> 46:40.357
The bones just stripped
clean, like peeling a banana.

46:48.634 --> 46:52.262
About noon the boy here came up from
the lower section and found them.

46:52.263 --> 46:54.597
I don't suppose it could've
been mountain lions?

46:54.598 --> 46:56.599
I've ranched here 22
years now, Doc...

46:56.600 --> 46:59.102
and I've had more than my
share of lions and wolves.

46:59.103 --> 47:00.927
It wasn't them.

47:08.487 --> 47:11.531
- Where did that come from?
- It was there when the boy got here.

47:11.532 --> 47:14.659
Stop worrying about that and tell
me what's picking my cattle clean.

47:14.660 --> 47:16.452
That's all I want to know.
What's doing it?

47:16.453 --> 47:18.538
- Take it easy, Andy.
- They're not your cattle.

47:18.539 --> 47:21.833
If it could happen last night, it
could happen tonight, tomorrow night.

47:21.834 --> 47:23.908
It could wipe me out.

47:26.589 --> 47:28.173
Aren't you going to do anything?

47:28.174 --> 47:31.634
I'm up a tree, Andy, like you are.
I don't know where to start thinking.

47:31.635 --> 47:33.828
You got any ideas, Doc?

47:34.096 --> 47:36.681
Better round up what livestock
you can and stand guard.

47:36.682 --> 47:38.850
If you see or hear anything,
ring me at the house.

47:38.851 --> 47:41.209
I'll be there, just in case.

47:42.354 --> 47:44.097
See you, Andy.

50:44.286 --> 50:45.815
Hi, Jack.

50:47.248 --> 50:48.873
Anyone pull through?

50:48.874 --> 50:52.028
You kidding? I want to
show you something.

51:03.013 --> 51:04.708
Morning, Doc.

51:05.724 --> 51:08.893
The Sheriff tells me you've seen
something like this before.

51:08.894 --> 51:10.257
Yeah.

51:10.354 --> 51:13.127
You buying this
accident business, Doc?

51:13.357 --> 51:15.384
- Aren't you?
- Nope.

51:15.442 --> 51:17.861
I can't figure it.
There isn't a skid mark.

51:17.862 --> 51:20.738
We ploughed through the wreck and
found the brakes still work.

51:20.739 --> 51:24.325
It's just like something grabbed the
pickup and threw it 30 feet off the road.

51:24.326 --> 51:26.602
Take a look at this, Doc.

51:36.881 --> 51:39.174
I can't understand why I
didn't spot this stuff...

51:39.175 --> 51:42.886
when I hauled those skeletons out of
here and stacked them on the other side.

51:42.887 --> 51:45.494
- They were here?
- Yes, sir. Why?

51:51.187 --> 51:54.506
There doesn't seem to be
any distinctive odour.

51:56.442 --> 51:57.721
Wow.

51:57.902 --> 52:00.737
Say, have you got a thermos or
a jar around here somewhere?

52:00.738 --> 52:02.739
I think there's one over here.

52:02.740 --> 52:06.409
- Same stuff we found at Andy's?
- Yeah, I think so.

52:06.410 --> 52:08.661
Well, that makes three then.

52:08.662 --> 52:09.913
Three?

52:09.914 --> 52:12.707
Here, the stuff you saw
yesterday, and Andy's.

52:12.708 --> 52:13.875
Andy?

52:13.876 --> 52:16.503
His wife found him at the
corral last night, dead.

52:16.504 --> 52:19.788
He'd been... Like the
cattle and sheep.

52:20.007 --> 52:22.800
There was a couple of gallons
of this liquid beside him.

52:22.801 --> 52:25.094
I wish you'd give me a
hand with this yarn, Doc.

52:25.095 --> 52:26.513
Stuff here I can't handle.

52:26.514 --> 52:28.765
Maybe there's stuff
here none of us can.

52:28.766 --> 52:31.601
If I were you, Joe, I'd write
this as a straight accident.

52:31.602 --> 52:33.937
If you print anything as
vague as what we've got...

52:33.938 --> 52:35.897
you'll scare half
the state to death.

52:35.898 --> 52:39.901
- News is news, Doc.
- Guess and a half-truth aren't news.

52:39.902 --> 52:42.403
Why don't you hold off till
we nail this down tight?

52:42.404 --> 52:44.739
Maybe then you'll have the
biggest story of your life.

52:44.740 --> 52:48.226
- What have you got, Matt?
- I don't know.

52:48.327 --> 52:52.580
But we've got to keep our minds open
and our mouths shut till we do know.

52:52.581 --> 52:54.165
Here you are, Doc.

52:54.166 --> 52:55.647
Thanks.

53:09.390 --> 53:10.788
Well?

53:11.016 --> 53:12.433
I'm not sure.

53:12.434 --> 53:16.271
It's impossible at this stage
to give you a positive answer.

53:16.272 --> 53:18.231
But it's related to insect venom.

53:18.232 --> 53:20.525
- Insect venom?
- Come off it, Matt.

53:20.526 --> 53:22.819
I know. But it checks.

53:22.820 --> 53:25.392
Acidic content, the whole works.

53:25.948 --> 53:28.199
I'm not sure what kind of
insect venom it is, but...

53:28.200 --> 53:30.159
Look, Matt, I'm willing
to play ball with you...

53:30.160 --> 53:32.483
but there's a limit
to what I'll swallow.

53:33.080 --> 53:35.331
Check it yourself, Joe.
I'll show you how.

53:35.332 --> 53:36.833
You're having nightmares, Doc.

53:36.834 --> 53:39.460
There's not an insect in the
world with that much venom.

53:39.461 --> 53:43.047
All right, don't take my word for it.
Get someone else to analyse it.

53:43.048 --> 53:45.574
- Who?
- Prof. Deemer.

53:46.677 --> 53:48.595
Hey, that's a good idea.

53:48.596 --> 53:50.847
I'll make a date with him.
Take the stuff out. Okay?

53:50.848 --> 53:52.098
Okay.

53:52.099 --> 53:54.601
- This time don't you forget to let me know.
- I won't, Joe.

53:54.602 --> 53:58.930
Insect venom in the large economy
size. I've heard everything.

53:59.899 --> 54:02.637
Give me Prof. Deemer
will you, Josh?

54:06.530 --> 54:07.975
Hello?

54:08.449 --> 54:10.309
Hello, Matt.

54:10.618 --> 54:13.203
No, I can talk. He's upstairs.

54:13.204 --> 54:16.358
I was hoping you'd call. There's...

54:16.540 --> 54:19.410
Matt, I've got to talk to you.

54:19.460 --> 54:22.910
Well, he's sick,
Matt, terribly sick.

54:23.130 --> 54:25.951
It's his face and his hands.

54:26.217 --> 54:28.343
Yes. Well, I did.

54:28.344 --> 54:31.580
I asked him to see a doctor,
but he won't do any...

54:32.806 --> 54:35.046
Steve? Steve!

54:39.897 --> 54:43.596
She hung up, Doc. You want
me to try to get her back?

55:15.933 --> 55:17.757
Hurry, Matt!

55:18.894 --> 55:20.562
- Are you all right?
- Something's happened.

55:20.563 --> 55:22.636
He can hardly breathe!

55:37.496 --> 55:40.270
Steve, get me some water, will you?

55:44.545 --> 55:47.046
Don't you think we ought
to get him to a hospital?

55:47.047 --> 55:51.375
There isn't anything they can do
for him we can't do right here.

56:05.065 --> 56:07.507
Give him some water, Steve.

56:19.205 --> 56:21.331
There's nothing you can do, Doctor.

56:21.332 --> 56:24.367
- Don't say that.
- Nothing anyone can do.

56:24.835 --> 56:28.700
Start with Jacobs, Professor.
He was the beginning.

56:29.423 --> 56:33.885
Eric and I spent every waking
hour on this ever since our...

56:33.886 --> 56:35.877
days at Oakridge.

56:36.889 --> 56:39.662
But he was an impatient old man.

56:40.434 --> 56:42.710
He was convinced that...

56:43.145 --> 56:46.132
an occasional failure
with the animals...

56:46.524 --> 56:49.179
didn't necessarily mean...

56:49.401 --> 56:52.721
that the nutrient would
fail with humans.

56:54.990 --> 56:56.471
Then...

56:56.867 --> 56:59.439
one day when I was in town...

56:59.995 --> 57:01.773
he and Paul...

57:01.997 --> 57:04.024
injected themselves.

57:04.208 --> 57:07.029
When did Jacobs
inject himself, sir?

57:07.545 --> 57:09.821
Four days before he died.

57:10.923 --> 57:13.696
Acromegalia developed in four days.

57:14.385 --> 57:18.534
The isotope triggered our
nutrient into a nightmare.

57:20.724 --> 57:22.205
Then...

57:22.643 --> 57:26.259
Paul went crazy and attacked me.

57:28.274 --> 57:32.721
While I was unconscious, he made
sure that I wouldn't survive.

57:35.489 --> 57:36.906
But I...

57:36.907 --> 57:39.314
continued the experiment...

57:39.743 --> 57:42.399
hoping that in the short time...

57:42.454 --> 57:44.943
left to me, I'd be able...

57:45.332 --> 57:47.157
to prove the...

57:47.418 --> 57:49.076
nutrient...

57:49.420 --> 57:50.818
would work.

57:52.548 --> 57:55.073
You should have seen them.

57:56.135 --> 57:58.493
You should have seen them.

57:59.513 --> 58:02.667
You should have seen
them before the fire.

58:03.517 --> 58:06.504
They lived on nothing
but our nutrient.

58:07.229 --> 58:10.845
A rat eight times normal size.

58:12.401 --> 58:15.804
A guinea pig big as a police dog.

58:16.697 --> 58:18.522
A tarantula...

58:20.201 --> 58:22.192
Lost, all lost.

58:22.703 --> 58:24.979
What about the tarantula?

58:25.789 --> 58:27.234
Burnt.

58:28.500 --> 58:30.111
All burnt.

58:34.507 --> 58:36.783
Let's take him upstairs.

58:45.851 --> 58:49.136
- He'll sleep for a while.
- Is there any hope?

58:50.606 --> 58:52.565
Here's something to
relieve the pain.

58:52.566 --> 58:54.651
Give him one when he wakes up.

58:54.652 --> 58:56.694
Where are you going?

58:56.695 --> 58:58.935
Well, the tarantula...

58:59.573 --> 59:04.020
There's something I want to check on.
I'll phone you when I get back.

59:22.263 --> 59:25.796
- Just set it up, Jean. Then you may go.
- Yes, sir.

59:27.768 --> 59:30.687
Well, that was a pretty accurate
analysis you made, Doctor.

59:30.688 --> 59:32.272
Then it is insect venom?

59:32.273 --> 59:35.859
Well, not precisely. It's from
a species called arachnida.

59:35.860 --> 59:39.060
- A spider?
- Well, a tarantula, to be exact.

59:39.363 --> 59:41.656
But I've never seen venom
in such quantity before.

59:41.657 --> 59:43.616
You know, there's more
venom in this test-tube...

59:43.617 --> 59:45.577
than you'll find in 100 tarantulas.

59:45.578 --> 59:49.789
You mean a tarantula that could
secrete that much venom, would be...

59:49.790 --> 59:51.916
100 times larger than normal?

59:51.917 --> 59:53.695
At least that.

59:56.922 --> 01:00:00.717
What would you say, Doctor, if I told
you I found pools of that venom?

01:00:00.718 --> 01:00:04.220
Four and five feet across,
two to three inches deep?

01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:06.598
I'd say you'd been
having a nightmare.

01:00:06.599 --> 01:00:10.018
Or that you're the biggest
liar since Baron Munchausen.

01:00:10.019 --> 01:00:11.769
It's a nightmare all
right, Doctor...

01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:14.355
but not the kind you mean,
and I'm not lying to you.

01:00:14.356 --> 01:00:17.025
- The tarantula film is ready, Professor.
- Thank you, Jean.

01:00:17.026 --> 01:00:19.819
Now look, I know you didn't fly
200 miles just for a joke...

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.155
but I simply can't believe
all you're telling me.

01:00:22.156 --> 01:00:24.490
- Good night, Professor.
- Good night, Jean.

01:00:24.491 --> 01:00:28.689
Well, under the circumstances
we might find this interesting.

01:00:32.625 --> 01:00:36.085
That's the largest of tarantulas,
from South America...

01:00:36.086 --> 01:00:38.755
and it's only a foot in diameter
with its legs outstretched.

01:00:38.756 --> 01:00:41.966
I know. Our Arizona
species is even smaller.

01:00:41.967 --> 01:00:44.427
That's right. Not more
than three inches in size.

01:00:44.428 --> 01:00:47.249
Now there it is, coming
out of its burrow.

01:00:50.142 --> 01:00:53.061
It's got eight legs and can
move faster than you think...

01:00:53.062 --> 01:00:57.390
which assures him of a long life.
As long as 25 years sometimes.

01:00:57.775 --> 01:01:00.109
That's the spider wasp...

01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:02.386
the tarantula's deadliest enemy.

01:01:02.696 --> 01:01:04.906
See? The wasp usually wins...

01:01:04.907 --> 01:01:09.484
but don't count on it, because the tarantula
doesn't know the meaning of fear.

01:01:12.915 --> 01:01:17.065
As you can see, he'll back down
a rattlesnake if he has to.

01:01:19.046 --> 01:01:20.409
See?

01:01:24.927 --> 01:01:26.386
They're flesh eaters, aren't they?

01:01:26.387 --> 01:01:29.556
Yes, and desert beetles
are their usual diet.

01:01:29.557 --> 01:01:32.934
Those powerful jaws are strong
enough to pierce a man's finger.

01:01:32.935 --> 01:01:35.478
There. The venom is
paralysing the victim.

01:01:35.479 --> 01:01:40.650
Tarantulas predigest their food by flooding
the wound with a powerful solvent...

01:01:40.651 --> 01:01:43.570
so that the flesh can be
sucked into the body.

01:01:43.571 --> 01:01:45.363
That would account for the bones.

01:01:45.364 --> 01:01:48.518
Dr. Hastings, your
imagination is showing.

01:01:49.285 --> 01:01:51.358
So that's it, Doctor.

01:01:53.664 --> 01:01:57.031
- How deadly is the venom?
- Not deadly at all.

01:01:57.084 --> 01:01:59.127
About as poisonous as a hornet's.

01:01:59.128 --> 01:02:01.700
No fun, mind you, but harmless.

01:02:01.881 --> 01:02:04.549
The few deaths that have been
reported are the result...

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:07.427
of germs entering the wound
at the time of the bite.

01:02:07.428 --> 01:02:10.513
- You make them sound like pets.
- Not pets, Doctor.

01:02:10.514 --> 01:02:12.473
Just part of the world about us.

01:02:12.474 --> 01:02:15.560
We must accept them as we do
the rest of God's creatures.

01:02:15.561 --> 01:02:18.466
Each has a function
in its own world.

01:02:18.522 --> 01:02:23.026
But what if circumstances magnified
one of them in size and strength?

01:02:23.027 --> 01:02:26.738
Took it out of its primitive world
and turned it loose in ours?

01:02:26.739 --> 01:02:28.907
Then expect something
that's fiercer...

01:02:28.908 --> 01:02:33.236
more cruel and deadly than anything
that ever walked the earth.

01:02:50.012 --> 01:02:52.138
How about Dr. Hastings'
call to Desert Rock?

01:02:52.139 --> 01:02:54.307
I'm afraid I won't be
able to get it for you.

01:02:54.308 --> 01:02:56.518
The lines are down between
Calamite and Desert Rock.

01:02:56.519 --> 01:02:59.312
Be about an hour before
they can resume service.

01:02:59.313 --> 01:03:02.023
- How'd that happen?
- I really don't know, sir.

01:03:02.024 --> 01:03:04.651
Do you want me to try
again in about an hour?

01:03:04.652 --> 01:03:06.928
No. Never mind. Thanks.

01:03:26.298 --> 01:03:28.325
Here you are, Jeb.

01:03:30.261 --> 01:03:32.453
Going to be a murky night.

01:03:32.972 --> 01:03:34.334
Yeah.

01:03:35.766 --> 01:03:39.185
Do you think that was lightning
we saw over to the west?

01:03:39.186 --> 01:03:43.398
If it was, it's the first time I ever
seen lightning throw off sparks.

01:03:43.399 --> 01:03:47.679
Maybe one of them college boys
short-circuited his nice new Geiger counter.

01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:50.807
What was that?

01:04:59.725 --> 01:05:01.309
- I'm at the airport.
- Oh.

01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:03.728
- Can you hear me now?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:05:03.729 --> 01:05:05.730
Jack, we haven't much time.

01:05:05.731 --> 01:05:08.233
I want you to round up every
available man. Arm them...

01:05:08.234 --> 01:05:10.485
Do what? What are
you talking about?

01:05:10.486 --> 01:05:11.945
Jack, do as I say.

01:05:11.946 --> 01:05:14.822
Notify the State Police to
meet you at the Deemer place.

01:05:14.823 --> 01:05:17.408
Notify the State Police?
You must be drunk.

01:05:17.409 --> 01:05:18.993
No. I haven't been drinking.

01:05:18.994 --> 01:05:22.163
- All I want you to do is...
- I know. Just call the State Police.

01:05:22.164 --> 01:05:23.748
Please, Jack. Believe me.

01:05:23.749 --> 01:05:25.625
All right, I'll do it.

01:05:25.626 --> 01:05:27.368
Thanks. I'll see you.

01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:00.609
He's coming, Matt, I can see it!

01:11:11.096 --> 01:11:13.088
There's Matt's car.

01:11:19.647 --> 01:11:21.814
- What's it all about?
- Jack, turn the cars around!

01:11:21.815 --> 01:11:23.942
- What for?
- There isn't time. I'll tell you later!

01:11:23.943 --> 01:11:25.886
Lieutenant, look!

01:11:30.533 --> 01:11:32.606
Jumping Jupiter!

01:11:38.415 --> 01:11:41.292
Get those submachine guns!
You boys, get back in the car.

01:11:41.293 --> 01:11:42.952
They won't stop it!

01:11:51.679 --> 01:11:54.681
Matt, if it follows the highway,
it'll come right into Desert Rock.

01:11:54.682 --> 01:11:56.808
- Doc, keys in your car?
- Yeah.

01:11:56.809 --> 01:11:58.852
Doc and Miss Clayton
are coming with us.

01:11:58.853 --> 01:12:01.396
Get in. You boys,
try to slow it down.

01:12:01.397 --> 01:12:05.262
- If you can't, take Doc's car and follow us.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:40.686 --> 01:12:42.604
- Come on. Start it, man!
- I can't start it.

01:12:42.605 --> 01:12:44.215
Come on, you'll flood it.

01:12:58.495 --> 01:12:59.704
That is correct.

01:12:59.705 --> 01:13:03.458
You've got at the outside 30 minutes
to get everybody out. Over.

01:13:03.459 --> 01:13:06.336
Desert Rock will be cleared
in 30 minutes. Over.

01:13:06.337 --> 01:13:08.546
Do you think dynamite
would stop him?

01:13:08.547 --> 01:13:12.175
Get a truck over to Murphy's,
load up all the dynamite he has.

01:13:12.176 --> 01:13:15.011
Bring it just north of Devil's Rock.
We'll be waiting for it.

01:13:15.012 --> 01:13:18.765
Yeah, dynamite might work.
But what if it doesn't?

01:13:18.766 --> 01:13:22.852
You got any other suggestions,
Doc? It'll be light soon.

01:13:22.853 --> 01:13:25.355
If we could get a message
to the air base at Sands.

01:13:25.356 --> 01:13:27.065
How are you going to do that?

01:13:27.066 --> 01:13:30.443
- Somebody could phone from town.
- Unless the lines are down.

01:13:30.444 --> 01:13:34.322
Sergeant, I want you to phone the
commanding officer at Sands Air Base.

01:13:34.323 --> 01:13:36.199
Any special instructions, Doc?

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.244
Yeah. If the boys have some
napalm, tell them to bring it along.

01:13:39.245 --> 01:13:44.071
Sergeant, tell them to load up with
napalm, rockets, anything they've got.

01:13:44.542 --> 01:13:45.856
Hurry it up, boys!

01:13:47.336 --> 01:13:49.587
- That's the last of it, Mr. Murphy.
- That's it, Joe.

01:13:49.588 --> 01:13:51.881
There isn't another stick of
dynamite in the whole town.

01:13:51.882 --> 01:13:53.132
Here. Prime them on the way.

01:13:53.133 --> 01:13:54.843
- See you later, I hope.
- You will.

01:13:54.844 --> 01:13:56.761
All right. Let her roll!

01:13:56.762 --> 01:13:59.121
Don't forget to prime them!

01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:27.742
Pull her right in here, boys!
Pull her in here.

01:14:27.877 --> 01:14:31.031
Right across the road. Come on!
Lend a hand, boys!

01:14:31.922 --> 01:14:33.464
Watch it now! They're all primed!

01:14:33.465 --> 01:14:34.632
Where do you want this dynamite?

01:14:34.633 --> 01:14:36.801
- Across the road.
- Shake it up, boys! Lend a hand!

01:14:36.802 --> 01:14:39.512
Watch it now! Put the boxes right
down there across the road.

01:14:39.513 --> 01:14:41.431
All right, let's go.

01:14:41.432 --> 01:14:43.433
Come on, boys. Get them down here!

01:14:43.434 --> 01:14:46.670
- All right. Here we go.
- Come on, get that dynamite down here.

01:14:46.896 --> 01:14:48.424
All right. Beautiful.

01:14:48.606 --> 01:14:51.774
- Do you think it will work?
- Dynamite's tricky stuff.

01:14:51.775 --> 01:14:54.694
It may blow it up. It may
just blow the highway up.

01:14:54.695 --> 01:14:56.821
Doggone, I wish we had some nitro.

01:14:56.822 --> 01:14:59.240
I'll have to see that tarantula
before I believe it.

01:14:59.241 --> 01:15:02.035
You'll see it, Joe, and
you'll wish you hadn't.

01:15:02.036 --> 01:15:05.735
Let's go! Get those
wires hooked up.

01:15:05.915 --> 01:15:07.692
Here he comes!

01:15:16.759 --> 01:15:18.204
Holy cow!

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:21.163
Come on! Get back!

01:15:27.436 --> 01:15:28.937
- Let's go!
- Come on.

01:15:28.938 --> 01:15:30.548
Get this truck turned around!

01:15:44.286 --> 01:15:45.815
Let's go!

01:15:57.216 --> 01:15:58.744
Hold it!

01:16:01.595 --> 01:16:03.171
We've gotta hurry it up.

01:16:05.975 --> 01:16:07.225
Hurry it up.

01:16:07.226 --> 01:16:08.624
I got it.

01:16:11.188 --> 01:16:12.633
Steady.

01:16:18.821 --> 01:16:20.183
Now!

01:16:35.796 --> 01:16:37.953
Let's get out of here.

01:17:06.327 --> 01:17:07.452
What now?

01:17:07.453 --> 01:17:08.786
- I don't know.
- We got to do something.

01:17:08.787 --> 01:17:11.247
Biggest story of my life and I
won't get a chance to write it.

01:17:11.248 --> 01:17:12.479
Look!

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.243
Look, here they come!

01:17:24.762 --> 01:17:26.504
Look at them!

01:17:41.862 --> 01:17:45.680
All right, Betts. Fire two
rockets on this first pass.

01:17:57.753 --> 01:17:59.328
Here goes.

01:18:43.549 --> 01:18:46.287
Dropping napalm. Follow in order.

01:18:55.019 --> 01:18:56.713
Dump them all.
