11:21.834 --> 11:23.834
SIMMS, MILLER, ANY LEADS
FROM THE TIP LINE?

11:23.834 --> 11:25.125
- NONE SO FAR.

11:25.125 --> 11:27.792
- MOSTLY GIRLFRIENDS TRYING
TO GET BACK AT THEIR EXES.

11:27.792 --> 11:28.917
- ALL RIGHT.
KEEP AT IT.

11:28.917 --> 11:30.709
MAYBE SOMETHING
WILL COME THROUGH.

11:30.709 --> 11:31.875
IN THE MEANTIME,
THIS FUCK HAS KILLED

11:31.875 --> 11:33.250
SEVEN PEOPLE
IN TWO WEEKS.

11:33.250 --> 11:36.458
LET'S STOP HIM BEFORE HE
MAKES IT TO NUMBER EIGHT.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.375
- HANNAH'S WRONG.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.375
OF COURSE I HAVE
A DARK PASSENGER.

11:43.375 --> 11:47.500
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
TO EXPLAIN THIS COMPULSION.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.709
[cell phone vibrates]

11:56.834 --> 11:58.875
I HOPE SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

11:58.875 --> 12:01.041
- WHO'S SENDING YOU
HUGS AND KISSES?

12:01.041 --> 12:04.250
- NO ONE.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.542
[sighs]

12:06.542 --> 12:08.250
- BULLSHIT.
THAT WAS A GIRL.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.709
WAS SHE SEXTING YOU?
YOU GOT PICTURES?

12:10.709 --> 12:13.375
COME ON,
I GOTTA RESTOCK MY SPANK BANK.

12:13.375 --> 12:15.834
HEY, ANGEL, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT DEXTER'S NEW GIRLFRIEND?

12:15.834 --> 12:17.625
- WHO, HANNAH MCKAY?
- HOW DID YOU--

12:17.625 --> 12:18.625
- JAMIE TOLD ME.

12:18.625 --> 12:21.500
- AHH, MY MAN.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.375
[giggles]

12:23.375 --> 12:25.083
HANNAH MCKAY!

12:25.083 --> 12:26.500
YEAH,
THAT IS SO AWESOME.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.709
- EXCUSE ME, BUT WHAT
IS SO FUCKING AWESOME

12:28.709 --> 12:29.667
ABOUT MY BROTHER
DATING A KILLER?

12:29.667 --> 12:31.917
YOU GUYS HEARD
SAL PRICE'S RECORDING.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.250
HANNAH CONFESSED
TO MURDER.

12:33.250 --> 12:35.792
- OH, COME ON, SHE WAS ONLY 15
WHEN SHE DID THAT.

12:35.792 --> 12:36.834
I MEAN, WHEN I WAS 15,
MY PARENTS STILL THOUGHT

12:36.834 --> 12:38.333
I WAS RETARDED.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.208
- HEY, HEY.

12:40.208 --> 12:41.583
I GET IT.

12:41.583 --> 12:45.208
HANNAH IS
AN ATTRACTIVE GIRL.

12:46.542 --> 12:49.083
BUT YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY BE CAREFUL.

12:49.083 --> 12:52.125
- YEAH, YOU--YOU SHOULD
DEFINITELY BE CAREFUL

12:52.125 --> 12:55.417
OF GETTING BURNED
BECAUSE SHE'S SO FREAKING HOT.

12:55.417 --> 12:57.542
- CAN I SEE YOU
IN MY OFFICE, PLEASE?

12:57.542 --> 12:59.250
- [sighs]

12:59.250 --> 13:01.250
- I DIDN'T REALIZE

13:01.250 --> 13:03.375
YOU AND HANNAH MCKAY
HAD GONE PUBLIC.

13:03.375 --> 13:04.917
- WE HADN'T,
UNTIL A MINUTE AGO.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.166
- WELL,
THAT'S KIND OF DANGEROUS.

13:06.166 --> 13:07.792
DON'T YOU THINK?

13:07.792 --> 13:10.083
DATING SOMEONE SO NOTORIOUS
OUT IN THE OPEN LIKE THAT,

13:10.083 --> 13:11.667
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO STAY
UNDER THE RADAR.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.959
- DEB, I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT HANNAH RIGHT NOW.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.709
CAN YOU JUST LEAVE IT?

13:15.709 --> 13:19.834
- FINE, YEAH.
I'LL BUTT OUT.

13:19.834 --> 13:21.959
I MEAN, WE'RE ALL
RESPONSIBLE ADULTS, RIGHT?

13:21.959 --> 13:24.250
YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE,
I'LL LIVE MINE,

13:24.250 --> 13:26.500
AND HANNAH
WILL LIVE HANNAH'S.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.458
- GREAT.
AND YOU'LL LEAVE HANNAH ALONE?

13:28.458 --> 13:32.125
- I'M SAYING THAT I'LL STAY
OUT OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

13:32.125 --> 13:33.959
I'M NOT GOING TO LET THAT WOMAN
GET AWAY WITH MURDER AGAIN.

13:33.959 --> 13:35.291
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

13:35.291 --> 13:37.959
- DEXTER,
I AM FUCKING SERIOUS.

13:37.959 --> 13:41.000
I HAVE COMPROMISED
THE SHIT OUT OF MYSELF FOR YOU.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.041
I AM SURE AS FUCK NOT GOING
TO DO IT FOR HANNAH MCKAY.

13:44.041 --> 13:47.000
- FINE.
I GET IT.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.417
- WHY ARE YOU
STANDING HERE?

13:48.417 --> 13:51.333
WE HAVE A PHANTOM
TO CATCH.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.166
[sighs]

14:05.542 --> 14:07.041
- SHE DID SAY "WE."

14:07.041 --> 14:09.875
PHILIP BOSSO.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.458
IN HIS LAST
27 ARSON INVESTIGATIONS,

14:11.458 --> 14:14.625
HE FOUND
THE FIRE'S ORIGIN POINT.

14:14.625 --> 14:16.000
EITHER HE'S GREAT
AT HIS JOB,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.875
OR ALL HE HAD TO DO
WAS LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

14:31.709 --> 14:33.000
- OKAY,
IT SAYS HERE

14:33.000 --> 14:35.792
THAT YOU WORK AS A JANITOR
AT THE Y IN BRICKELL BAY

14:35.792 --> 14:38.041
WHERE THE, UH, PHANTOM
SET THE FIRST FIRE.

14:38.041 --> 14:40.208
- MM-HMM.

14:40.208 --> 14:42.041
- DID YOU SEE
ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS

14:42.041 --> 14:44.417
WHEN YOU WERE MAKING
YOUR ROUNDS THAT NIGHT?

14:44.417 --> 14:46.583
- NO, I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW IT HAPPENED

14:46.583 --> 14:47.959
UNTIL I SAW
THE FIRE TRUCK.

14:47.959 --> 14:50.959
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

14:50.959 --> 14:52.667
- RIGHT.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

14:52.667 --> 14:56.542
AND DID YOU SEE ANYONE
IN A FIREPROOF SUIT?

14:56.542 --> 14:58.917
- DON'T YOU THINK
I WOULD'VE TOLD YOU IF I HAD?

15:04.500 --> 15:05.542
- BOSSO'S S.U.V.

15:05.542 --> 15:07.417
BUT WHERE DID HE GO?

15:07.417 --> 15:11.041
IS HE
ABOUT TO STRIKE AGAIN?

15:21.750 --> 15:25.166
ELECTRIC FUSES
AND CAMPING FUEL.

15:25.166 --> 15:27.041
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:27.041 --> 15:29.083
- THAT'S NOT
A FIREPROOF SUIT.

15:29.083 --> 15:32.542
- DEXTER, YOU
A CIVIL WAR REENACTOR TOO?

15:32.542 --> 15:34.250
YOU HERE FOR THE BATTLE?

15:34.250 --> 15:36.959
- UH--

15:36.959 --> 15:38.125
YEAH.
[chuckles]

15:38.125 --> 15:39.625
- WHICH SIDE
YOU FIGHTING FOR?

15:39.625 --> 15:41.667
- THE NORTH.

15:41.667 --> 15:44.083
- [grumbles]
YOU BLUE BELLY.

15:44.083 --> 15:46.250
I SHOULD BUCK AND GAG YOU
RIGHT HERE.

15:46.250 --> 15:49.583
[laughter]

15:49.583 --> 15:50.917
WERE YOU THERE
LAST WEEKEND

15:50.917 --> 15:53.458
AT THE SIXTH MAINE BATTERY
CANNON FIRINGS?

15:53.458 --> 15:56.291
- NO, DAMN.
I GUESS I MISSED THAT ONE.

15:56.291 --> 15:57.792
- IT'S
A WHOLE WEEKEND AFFAIR.

15:57.792 --> 15:59.792
I WAS IN CHARGE
OF SPECIAL EFFECTS--

15:59.792 --> 16:02.750
GROUND, AIR BURSTS,
ARTILLERY FIRE.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.917
- WHICH EXPLAINS
WHAT'S IN HIS CAR

16:04.917 --> 16:08.417
AND GIVES HIM AN ALIBI
FOR SATURDAY'S FIRE.

16:08.417 --> 16:11.750
- WANT TO SEE SOME PICTURES?
- YOU BET.

16:14.417 --> 16:16.125
WOW.

16:16.125 --> 16:20.166
BOSSO'S NOT THE PHANTOM.
HE'S JUST STRANGE.

16:20.166 --> 16:22.625
BUT IF HE DIDN'T SET
THOSE FIRES, THEN WHO DID?

16:22.625 --> 16:23.667
[cell phone vibrates]
OH.

16:23.667 --> 16:26.417
HANG ON JUST ONE SEC.

16:37.166 --> 16:40.166
I GUESS COFFEE
WENT BETTER THAN EXPECTED.

16:43.417 --> 16:46.709
- AFTER COFFEE, HANNAH WANTED
TO SHOW ME THE FLOWER MART.

16:46.709 --> 16:48.667
SO WE'RE WALKING AROUND,

16:48.667 --> 16:50.792
AND I CATCH A WHIFF
OF THIS FLOWER.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.917
IT SMELLS
JUST LIKE LICORICE.

16:52.917 --> 16:54.709
SO I ASK HANNAH
WHAT IT IS--

16:54.709 --> 16:56.125
- AND I TELL HIM
IT'S ANISE.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.208
- SO I TELL THE LADY
IN THE BOOTH

16:58.208 --> 17:00.500
THAT HER ANISE
SMELLS DELICIOUS.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.750
- [laughs]
- [chuckles]

17:01.750 --> 17:03.333
- EXCEPT YOU DIDN'T QUITE
PRONOUNCE IT RIGHT.

17:03.333 --> 17:04.750
- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I SAID,

17:04.750 --> 17:06.166
BUT SHE DID NOT
REACT WELL.

17:06.166 --> 17:07.875
- WELL, DO YOU BLAME HER?
- [laughs]

17:07.875 --> 17:10.583
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD
QUITE A DAY.

17:10.583 --> 17:14.125
- YEAH, UH--
WE, UH, WE REALLY DID.

17:14.125 --> 17:16.333
- SO, CLINT, HOW LONG
ARE YOU GOING TO BE IN TOWN?

17:16.333 --> 17:17.709
- OH, JUST ANOTHER DAY
OR SO.

17:17.709 --> 17:19.625
AND THEN I'M OFF
TO LOUISIANA.

17:19.625 --> 17:21.291
- OH, UH,
WHAT'S IN LOUISIANA?

17:21.291 --> 17:23.000
A POKER TOURNAMENT?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.875
- NO.
I AM ALL DONE WITH THAT.

17:24.875 --> 17:28.000
I AM LOOKING FOR AN HONEST WAY
TO MAKE A LIVING.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
AND I THINK I FOUND
THE PERFECT THING.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.875
YOU READY?
[drums table]

17:31.875 --> 17:33.667
CRAWFISH.
- CRAWFISH?

17:33.667 --> 17:34.709
- YEAH, A CRAWFISH FARM.

17:34.709 --> 17:36.417
I GOT A LINE ON ONE
NEAR LAFAYETTE.

17:36.417 --> 17:39.834
I'M GOING TO CALL IT
"BIG CLINT'S CRAWDADDIES,"

17:39.834 --> 17:40.667
AND I WILL SHIP 'EM
TO YOU FRESH

17:40.667 --> 17:41.917
ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.

17:41.917 --> 17:43.208
- THERE'S A MARKET
FOR THAT?

17:43.208 --> 17:44.417
- YOU BET YOUR BALLS
THERE IS.

17:44.417 --> 17:46.834
AIN'T NOTHING LIKE
A CRAWFISH BOIL--

17:46.834 --> 17:50.750
WEDDINGS, BACHELOR PARTIES,
FOURTH OF JULY.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.166
EVERYBODY
LIKES CRAWDADS.

17:53.166 --> 17:55.375
- WELL, I AM EXCITED
FOR YOU, DAD.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.125
AND I'M PROUD OF YOU.

17:57.125 --> 18:01.375
- WELL, THANK YOU, HONEY.
MEANS A LOT.

18:01.375 --> 18:02.542
- WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

18:02.542 --> 18:03.834
WHY DON'T YOU CHECK OUT
OF THAT MOTEL

18:03.834 --> 18:05.792
AND COME AND STAY WITH ME
WHILE YOU'RE HERE?

18:05.792 --> 18:07.083
YOU'RE STARTING
A NEW BUSINESS.

18:07.083 --> 18:08.667
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
TO SAVE YOUR MONEY NOW.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.041
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
I COULDN'T DO THAT.

18:10.041 --> 18:11.750
I-I WOULDN'T WANT
TO INTRUDE.

18:11.750 --> 18:13.333
- OH, YOU'RE NOT.
- YEAH, DON'T WORRY.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.375
I WAS GOING HOME
TONIGHT ANYWAY.

18:15.375 --> 18:17.291
WHY DON'T I BRING YOU GUYS
BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING?

18:17.291 --> 18:20.375
BEST DOUGHNUTS
YOU EVER TASTED.

18:22.375 --> 18:24.291
- OKAY.

18:32.417 --> 18:37.208
[indistinct chatter]

18:45.792 --> 18:47.083
[spraying liquid]

18:47.083 --> 18:48.583
- AAH! AAH! OH!

18:48.583 --> 18:49.750
- AAH!

18:49.750 --> 18:50.959
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING, MAN?

18:50.959 --> 18:52.166
- GET OUT OF HERE.

18:52.166 --> 18:59.125
[screaming]

19:03.667 --> 19:06.375
- MMM.
MMM.

19:06.375 --> 19:09.250
MAN, IT'S LIKE I DIED
AND WENT TO HEAVEN.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.583
I THINK IF I HAD
ONE MORE OF THOSE,

19:11.583 --> 19:12.625
I PROBABLY WILL.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.959
I'D LIKE TO MAKE
AN ORANGE JUICE TOAST

19:14.959 --> 19:18.125
TO THE CUTEST DAMN COUPLE
I HAVE EVER SEEN--

19:18.125 --> 19:20.083
OUTSIDE OF ME AND BUBBA
IN PRISON.

19:20.083 --> 19:22.000
- [laughs]
- THAT'S JUST A LITTLE JOKE.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.667
- [chuckles]
RIGHT.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.792
- WELL,
TO YOU, DAD,

19:25.792 --> 19:27.417
THE KING OF CRAWFISH.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.208
- THERE'S
NO STOPPING ME.

19:30.208 --> 19:35.166
I JUST GOTTA GET
THE MONEY TOGETHER.

19:36.291 --> 19:37.667
- SO WHERE ARE YOU
AT WITH THAT?

19:37.667 --> 19:39.166
- WELL, ACTUALLY,

19:39.166 --> 19:40.750
THAT'S SOMETHING I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

19:40.750 --> 19:44.250
I FIGURED YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO GET IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.000
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- WELL, YOU KNOW, INVEST.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.208
I ONLY NEED
ABOUT 20 GRAND MORE.

19:48.208 --> 19:49.792
- OH, WOW.

19:49.792 --> 19:51.166
- NO,
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

19:51.166 --> 19:53.208
I MEAN, THERE'S
A GUARANTEED 10% A YEAR BACK

19:53.208 --> 19:54.250
ON YOUR INVESTMENT.

19:54.250 --> 19:57.375
- I'M SORRY, DAD.
I-I CAN'T.

19:57.375 --> 19:59.458
ALL MY MONEY'S TIED UP
IN THE BUSINESS.

19:59.458 --> 20:01.917
- AW, COME ON, NOW.
NOT ALL YOUR MONEY.

20:01.917 --> 20:03.333
I MEAN, THERE'S GOT TO BE
A LITTLE WIGGLE ROOM

20:03.333 --> 20:04.458
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

20:04.458 --> 20:06.291
I'M SURE YOU COULD
REMORTGAGE YOUR PLACE.

20:06.291 --> 20:07.542
- I DON'T THINK SO.

20:07.542 --> 20:09.208
- NO, THIS PLACE HAS GOT TO BE
WORTH A PRETTY PENNY.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.542
- DAD, IT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.000
- WELL, FINE.
WHATEVER.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.458
FORGET IT.

20:16.458 --> 20:18.458
- I'M SORRY.
I JUST DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS.

20:18.458 --> 20:19.625
- WHAT KIND OF DAUGHTER

20:19.625 --> 20:21.333
WON'T EVEN HELP OUT
HER OWN FUCKING FATHER?

20:21.333 --> 20:23.792
- JESUS, DAD.

20:23.792 --> 20:27.542
- LOOK, I NEED SOME AIR.
I'M GOING TO GO FOR A DRIVE.

20:27.542 --> 20:31.250
- DAD,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

20:34.959 --> 20:36.208
YOU THINK
I WAS WRONG,

20:36.208 --> 20:37.542
TELLING HIM
I COULDN'T GIVE HIM THE MONEY?

20:37.542 --> 20:38.667
- OF COURSE NOT.

20:38.667 --> 20:41.125
- BUT I FEEL LIKE
I SHOULD HELP HIM OUT.

20:41.125 --> 20:43.625
[tires squealing]

20:43.625 --> 20:44.709
- WHY?

20:44.709 --> 20:48.917
- BECAUSE HE'S MY DAD.

20:48.917 --> 20:51.542
- THE SAME DAD
WHO ALMOST LET YOU DROWN?

20:51.542 --> 20:53.417
WHO LEFT YOU ALONE
IN A HOTEL FOR THREE DAYS?

20:53.417 --> 20:55.875
- HE'S TRYING
TO CHANGE.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.166
- I DOUBT IT.

20:57.166 --> 20:58.291
- LOOK, I KNOW HE'S DONE
SOME BAD THINGS,

20:58.291 --> 21:02.500
BUT THERE'S GOOD
INSIDE OF HIM, AS WELL.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.542

33:00.959 --> 33:04.417
YOU KNOW, THAT SOMEHOW,
THAT'S THE KEY.

33:04.417 --> 33:08.166

SHE KILLED A COUNSELOR
AT A HALFWAY HOUSE.

40:21.625 --> 40:23.875

GOT HEATED.

THE FIRST SHOT AND THE SECOND.

42:20.458 --> 42:24.333
I WANT THE TRUTH.

42:26.208 --> 42:29.208
- I TOLD YOU
THE TRUTH.

42:29.208 --> 42:31.417
I WENT DOWN
WHEN GEORGE SHOT ME.

42:31.417 --> 42:34.625
HE STARTED TO BEAT
THE SHIT OUT OF NADIA.

42:34.625 --> 42:36.500
I REACHED
FOR MY GUN.

42:36.500 --> 42:40.166
HE WHEELED AROUND,
READY TO BLOW MY HEAD OFF,

42:40.166 --> 42:42.208
AND I TOOK HIM OUT.

42:42.208 --> 42:45.834
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

42:48.875 --> 42:51.041
- OKAY.
THEN WE'LL GO WITH THAT.

42:51.041 --> 42:54.208
- MINUS NADIA.

43:01.125 --> 43:03.041
- HEY.
WHERE'S DEXTER?

43:03.041 --> 43:04.333
- I DON'T KNOW.

43:04.333 --> 43:05.375
BUT I'D LIKE
TO POINT OUT THE FACT

43:05.375 --> 43:07.291
THAT I AM HERE,
DOING MY DUTY.

43:07.291 --> 43:08.709
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

43:10.959 --> 43:14.166
- I FEEL LIKE
I'M GOING TO BE SICK.

43:14.166 --> 43:16.583
HOW CAN THAT BE
MY OWN FATHER?

43:16.583 --> 43:21.208
[cell phone vibrating]

43:24.750 --> 43:27.125
- I'M SORRY TO HAVE
TO TELL YOU ALL THIS,

43:27.125 --> 43:29.709
BUT I NEEDED TO KNOW
THAT HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

43:32.083 --> 43:33.792
- ARLENE SHRAM
IS THE ONLY PERSON

43:33.792 --> 43:36.250
WHO CAN PUT ME IN JAIL.

43:37.709 --> 43:41.500
SHE SAW ME PUT POISON
IN THAT COUNSELOR'S FOOD.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.583
I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO PAY HIM.

43:43.583 --> 43:44.542
- THAT'S NOT GOING
TO SOLVE ANYTHING.

43:44.542 --> 43:45.709
