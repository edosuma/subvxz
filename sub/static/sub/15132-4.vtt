WEBVTT

00:00.141 --> 00:01.679
You need to watch out
for yourselves out here.

00:01.690 --> 00:02.924
Father?

00:03.851 --> 00:06.270
If I thought you were
exploiting my grief

00:06.282 --> 00:09.593
just to gain license
to practice your sorcery...

00:09.604 --> 00:11.952
Young man, you have
no idea what you have done!

00:16.488 --> 00:18.366
You will leave the palace tonight.

00:18.390 --> 00:20.861
If you ever return
your life is forfeit.

00:22.112 --> 00:24.296
I'm sorry.

00:49.913 --> 00:53.649
Well?
How much water is there?

00:53.717 --> 00:57.899
Two days...
if we half the ration.

00:57.923 --> 01:00.589
- We halved them yesterday.
- And the day before.

01:13.941 --> 01:16.078
We are still miles
from Baruk.

01:16.101 --> 01:18.211
And there hasn't
been wind in days.

01:18.234 --> 01:21.556
Which means there
will be some soon.

01:21.577 --> 01:24.195
Don't worry.
How are we for food?

01:24.218 --> 01:26.976
Fine, if you like garlic.

01:26.999 --> 01:30.876
We could have it with this.
Whatever it is.

01:31.839 --> 01:33.917
Assuming it doesn't eat us first.

01:33.940 --> 01:36.067
Look, I'm sure Cook can
rustle us something up.

01:36.089 --> 01:38.380
You think so?

01:39.540 --> 01:41.653
I just saw a ship.

01:41.677 --> 01:44.508
There isn't even a breeze.
Where could a ship come from?

01:44.531 --> 01:47.112
I saw it, a ship.

01:47.135 --> 01:48.450
I'll take a look.

01:48.474 --> 01:51.403
I'll come with you.

02:02.928 --> 02:05.324
He's hallucinating.

02:05.347 --> 02:08.269
None of us have had more than
a mouthful of water in the last 24 hours.

02:08.275 --> 02:11.991
I know.
But this freak weather will pass.

02:12.014 --> 02:18.106
I'm sure. We just need to sit it out,
be patient...

02:18.130 --> 02:22.203
As patient as we can be.

02:22.227 --> 02:25.368
Hm.
You thought there was a ship.

02:25.385 --> 02:27.240
Of course not.

02:41.999 --> 02:45.956
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
www.addic7ed.com

03:23.646 --> 03:27.660
Banishing that woman,
that was the right thing.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.713
She was the only one who
seemed to truly understand.

03:33.737 --> 03:35.499
Your pain?

03:36.308 --> 03:40.191
Taryn did not feel your pain.
She only recognized it, fed it,

03:40.214 --> 03:43.431
to bind you to her,
twist you to her will.

03:46.812 --> 03:52.631
Vengeance, brother,
is a thing of destruction.

03:52.655 --> 03:54.804
That is what is in my heart.

03:54.827 --> 03:57.253
What you build,
not what you destroy,

03:57.277 --> 04:00.410
will stand as testament
to your love for your son.

04:03.216 --> 04:09.330
Brother, please,
let this thing go.

04:18.874 --> 04:21.577
The brother is buried here.

04:50.132 --> 04:53.304
So, Sinbad,
Jamil will help me find you.

05:45.566 --> 05:47.198
Stupid.

05:51.803 --> 05:56.902
Mistakes. The last three moves.
I need to go back.

05:56.926 --> 05:59.737
No, Cook. Cook, what are you doing?
You can't change them.

06:11.630 --> 06:19.056
The heat, freezing nights,
doesn't make any sense.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.706
The southerly winds
should have pushed us.

06:21.730 --> 06:25.827
Take a look at Cook, will you?

06:25.895 --> 06:28.179
Cook.

06:28.191 --> 06:29.811
Wise to get out of the sun.

06:29.835 --> 06:33.419
Now? Or later?

06:34.793 --> 06:38.309
Or does it matter?

06:39.154 --> 06:40.422
Come on.

06:49.281 --> 06:53.987
You'd think after this,
cool air would be a relief.

07:22.749 --> 07:26.166
Yes!

07:26.190 --> 07:29.302
I got one.

07:29.325 --> 07:32.355
Now at least we can eat.

07:37.264 --> 07:41.187
You better be as sweet as a
Byzantine dancing girl.

07:41.210 --> 07:44.060
Rotten.

07:45.059 --> 07:46.984
Dead already.

07:48.159 --> 07:51.223
We can't eat that.

07:56.082 --> 07:58.850
Over here!

07:58.874 --> 08:01.234
Out there, look.

08:01.257 --> 08:03.782
- What is it?
- A light.

08:07.923 --> 08:13.069
- Your mind is playing tricks.
- No, no, no.

08:13.092 --> 08:16.722
There. A lantern.

08:16.745 --> 08:19.907
- Has to be a ship.
- Maybe they're trying to attract our attention.

08:19.930 --> 08:22.036
Then they can wait on
daylight.

08:22.052 --> 08:23.179
A ship.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.705
But they could have food or water.

08:26.314 --> 08:30.663
- We should investigate.
- No! I'm with Gunnar.

08:34.197 --> 08:37.993
It could be gone by morning.
We go now.

08:38.013 --> 08:41.220
If the big man's scared of the dark,
I'll go with you.

09:20.025 --> 09:22.372
It's quieter than
a dead man's house.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.426
You'd know.

09:24.450 --> 09:25.530
Easy pickings.

09:30.478 --> 09:32.168
Oh, it's cold.

09:34.284 --> 09:36.492
- You okay?
- Yeah, of course.

09:38.277 --> 09:39.724
Here.

09:41.140 --> 09:43.265
Rina.

10:13.242 --> 10:16.076
Ugh...

10:18.982 --> 10:22.129
It looks like
some kind of wedding feast.

10:30.565 --> 10:33.829
- Let's get out of here.
- Where there's silver...

10:35.768 --> 10:38.739
You're right, we should go.

10:46.964 --> 10:49.974
There must be supplies somewhere.

10:50.094 --> 10:53.812
Let's check the hold.

11:09.968 --> 11:13.643
Never! Not on my ship!

11:14.320 --> 11:17.567
- What are you doing?
- We can't leave him to die.

11:17.590 --> 11:19.457
You know nothing of
the ways of the sea!

11:19.480 --> 11:20.671
Oh, whereas a salty old
duck like you--

11:20.694 --> 11:22.894
I was born on these waters!

11:22.917 --> 11:26.316
If plague killed his shipmates,
then he carries it!

11:26.339 --> 11:27.924
We die a little faster!

11:27.949 --> 11:31.622
Have you ever seen a plague death,
little doctor?!

11:41.739 --> 11:43.242
Nothing?

11:45.074 --> 11:49.012
- No food, no water?
- Take a look yourself.

11:49.693 --> 11:52.856
- There must have been something.
- Maggots.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.874
- Caterpillars.
- And a rotting feast.

11:56.578 --> 12:00.915
Maybe you missed something.
We should board her again in daylight.

12:00.939 --> 12:02.911
Who is he?

12:02.935 --> 12:06.192
Careful.
Maybe he does have the plague.

12:07.519 --> 12:11.239
Those marks on his face.

12:17.213 --> 12:18.845
You don't see them?

12:20.919 --> 12:23.878
This whole place stinks of death.

12:27.824 --> 12:30.864
His ship, it's gone.
Where is it?

12:30.888 --> 12:34.835
A mirage.
The ship is still there.

12:34.859 --> 12:38.760
- We see an image--
- I know what a mirage is, Anwar.

12:38.778 --> 12:42.218
When the light fades,
it'll become visible again.

13:09.579 --> 13:11.898
I see...

13:13.779 --> 13:15.834
the blood on your soul.

13:20.073 --> 13:24.406
Gunnar?

13:25.287 --> 13:27.981
What?
What's happened?

13:28.005 --> 13:30.816
Gunnar.

13:38.372 --> 13:41.489
Where am I?

13:41.512 --> 13:42.992
You're safe.

13:43.015 --> 13:45.757
- Who are you?
- Anicetus.

13:45.781 --> 13:50.410
- Oh. Greek.
- The crew, what happened to them?

13:50.433 --> 13:54.026
Oh, so many questions.

13:54.050 --> 13:57.406
- Who are you?
- I'm Sinbad.

13:57.934 --> 14:05.437
- We've met before.
- No. You're mistaken.

14:05.460 --> 14:07.527
He needs rest.

14:07.541 --> 14:10.840
Apart from you,
there was a wedding party.

14:10.861 --> 14:16.230
- Oh, I know nothing of this.
- The others want their wat--

14:19.101 --> 14:20.728
Water...

14:48.758 --> 14:51.212
This is his doing.

14:55.296 --> 14:57.742
Anicetus hasn't been alone
since he came onboard.

14:57.765 --> 15:01.006
You should never have brought
him onto my ship.

15:02.626 --> 15:04.446
Look!

15:33.910 --> 15:40.788
Why did you run... from your people?

15:40.811 --> 15:43.246
You wouldn't understand.

15:45.524 --> 15:48.071
They believed I had an obligation.

15:48.095 --> 15:52.525
Our city was threatened by
a great enemy many years ago.

15:52.549 --> 15:55.853
Our elders struck a deal.
We were saved,

15:55.877 --> 15:58.390
but a price had to be paid.

16:03.420 --> 16:07.629
Things like that will eat away at you
if you let them.

16:08.128 --> 16:10.159
Best to put it behind you.

16:13.839 --> 16:19.100
Is that ever possible?
Your brother, is that behind you?

16:39.938 --> 16:42.861
- Let me help you.
- Oh, thank you.

16:45.819 --> 16:50.728
- You should be resting.
- Oh, the fresh air.

16:57.039 --> 17:01.816
Life is such a fragile gift,
isn't it?

17:04.021 --> 17:09.523
- Yes.
- Said with feeling.

17:11.061 --> 17:17.002
I lost my father... recently.

17:18.035 --> 17:20.477
I'm sorry, child.

17:20.501 --> 17:26.569
Still, some of that which is lost
can be found.

17:43.042 --> 17:45.401
This isn't natural.

17:45.425 --> 17:48.343
The old man
and the ship are part of it.

17:48.366 --> 17:51.433
- Cook knows it.
- Cook isn't exactly himself.

17:51.457 --> 17:54.322
Dare you rob all you like!

17:54.334 --> 17:58.541
I will never revenge thou!

17:58.564 --> 18:00.784
Here!

18:00.808 --> 18:05.798
No desert debts,
no camels' milk.

18:10.902 --> 18:13.147
I'll get Anwar.

18:14.427 --> 18:18.320
You know the work of
Abu al Hashim Alzarab?

18:18.344 --> 18:22.320
Abur Hashim, of course.

18:22.343 --> 18:25.678
An old man like me
makes a point of staying up to date

18:25.701 --> 18:29.024
with all attempts to extend
the human life.

18:29.048 --> 18:32.632
He truly is the master of all surgeons.

18:32.633 --> 18:36.093
Changed the face
of surgery as we know it.

18:37.686 --> 18:42.755
You have read Abur Hashim's
own medical treatise?

18:42.776 --> 18:47.330
- No. You have?
- In Seville.

18:47.353 --> 18:52.242
In the original Latin.

18:52.266 --> 18:55.787
Now, tell me...

18:56.961 --> 19:03.194
What's a bright young man like you
doing in a rundown ship like this?

19:03.195 --> 19:06.299
What?

19:06.322 --> 19:11.973
If a rock could drink,
it would fly.

19:11.996 --> 19:14.850
- Joy!
- Get him back in the shade.

19:14.873 --> 19:17.442
Cook, come on.

19:17.466 --> 19:23.102
Chicken, chicken, chicken!

19:25.684 --> 19:28.484
He's just a little further down the road
than the rest of us, isn't he?

19:28.508 --> 19:30.574
There must be
something we can do.

19:30.598 --> 19:34.990
Stay together,
keep each other's minds engaged.

20:14.801 --> 20:18.315
What about you?
Were you always a trader?

20:18.335 --> 20:22.241
- Always alone? Huh?
- May I join you?

20:23.741 --> 20:26.884
- If it's all the same to you, I'd rather you--
- No, of course.

20:28.739 --> 20:32.327
- Please, sit.
- Thank you.

20:33.818 --> 20:36.380
Stories?

20:38.068 --> 20:40.992
Keep our minds at work.

20:42.177 --> 20:44.783
- Tell us of your travels.
- No offense,

20:44.807 --> 20:47.228
the older a man gets,
the longer his stories grow.

20:47.252 --> 20:48.614
Rina.

20:48.637 --> 20:52.391
No, she speaks the truth.

20:52.414 --> 20:55.171
Anyway, I've told you my story.

20:55.195 --> 20:58.435
You've been everywhere,
but you're from nowhere.

20:59.727 --> 21:02.157
What about you, child?

21:02.181 --> 21:05.347
I'm nobody's child.

21:09.595 --> 21:15.146
As kids we used to go to
the old square in Basra.

21:15.169 --> 21:19.760
We'd flick dog muck on the slippers
of wealthy bargain hunters

21:19.779 --> 21:23.571
and then send them in the direction
of our own shoeshine store.

21:23.594 --> 21:27.398
Nice.

21:28.796 --> 21:34.051
- One day, we went--
- You said "we".

21:34.979 --> 21:37.690
You and who?

21:37.714 --> 21:42.164
My... My, um...

22:08.942 --> 22:11.409
You saw something
in the flames.

22:13.612 --> 22:15.880
No.

22:19.241 --> 22:22.854
Enough of stories.

22:27.087 --> 22:29.423
Well, maybe we could sing.

22:29.447 --> 22:33.530
I prefer a good drinking game.

22:34.833 --> 22:38.145
I should go and
check on the charts.

22:38.164 --> 22:42.367
- We're not moving, Anwar.
- Still, it's good to check,

22:42.391 --> 22:45.273
make sure we know where we are.

22:46.692 --> 22:49.344
Who was it in the flames?

22:49.368 --> 22:50.671
You saw him?

22:50.695 --> 22:53.746
Oh, a trick of your mind.

22:53.770 --> 22:57.865
Whoever he is, you miss him.

22:57.889 --> 23:00.648
He's dead.

23:00.672 --> 23:03.908
Guilt... a natural emotion.

23:03.931 --> 23:06.397
The death of a loved one.

23:18.662 --> 23:23.225
It was your brother you saw
in the flames, wasn't it?

23:23.248 --> 23:26.883
- I'm sorry, I understand.
- You understand nothing.

23:26.901 --> 23:29.824
What's done is done.

23:29.848 --> 23:33.679
Besides, your father's death
was a tragedy but no more.

23:33.703 --> 23:37.519
No more?
It's you who knows nothing.

23:37.543 --> 23:43.764
I know self pity when I see it.
Go, cry yourself to sleep, princess.

23:43.787 --> 23:46.406
You don't know anything about
who I really am.

23:46.429 --> 23:51.666
You think tears come easily to me,
that all I care for is myself?

23:55.377 --> 23:58.877
If he believes so,
he's mistaken.

24:01.600 --> 24:06.661
Sinbad has not made peace
with his loss either.

24:08.886 --> 24:14.335
- You can't make peace with ghosts.
- If you could, you would?

24:15.893 --> 24:20.344
Sometimes what's lost can be found.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.982
Someone help me!

26:11.783 --> 26:16.672
Hallucinations induced by thirst.

26:16.695 --> 26:21.393
I dreamt I was walking between
the stacks of the library of Alexandria,

26:21.405 --> 26:23.284
as they burned.

26:23.307 --> 26:25.470
But that's what it was, a dream.

26:27.372 --> 26:28.535
You alright?

26:28.558 --> 26:31.009
I smelled metal and blood.

26:33.757 --> 26:36.198
I heard the screaming.

26:44.188 --> 26:48.286
These visions seem
more real than what is real.

26:48.310 --> 26:50.761
You sound like
you speak from experience.

26:50.785 --> 26:54.354
It's probably nothing more than
us working through our fears.

26:54.378 --> 26:58.392
- I fear nothing.
- Except a harmless old man.

27:10.271 --> 27:16.034
- Well, have you seen--
- Me? No, no, not a thing.

27:16.057 --> 27:18.652
You'd best go check on Cook.

27:42.435 --> 27:44.169
Master.

27:54.130 --> 27:57.348
I said I would take your life
if you ever return.

27:57.416 --> 27:59.450
I have disobeyed your command

27:59.473 --> 28:03.747
because without your love
and patronage my life is worthless.

28:04.893 --> 28:09.137
Only before you do,
let me do you one last service.

28:09.160 --> 28:13.115
I have my brother's love and
no need of your twisted services.

28:13.138 --> 28:15.598
Can your brother give you Sinbad?

28:18.705 --> 28:23.578
- Where is he?
- He sails for Baruk.

28:26.973 --> 28:29.077
The dark arts have shown me.

29:05.359 --> 29:07.580
Let me see.

30:27.176 --> 30:28.921
Please.

30:30.436 --> 30:32.820
You're thirsty.

30:34.980 --> 30:37.117
Drink.

30:45.724 --> 30:50.009
You know why I'm here?
Good.

30:54.564 --> 31:02.314
You can undo what is done,
bring my father back?

31:05.725 --> 31:07.744
Hundreds of years ago,

31:07.768 --> 31:12.782
your people suffered at the hands
of a terrible enemy.

31:13.841 --> 31:18.432
They enslaved our men,
took our women.

31:19.148 --> 31:21.745
But then a great sickness
swept through their ranks.

31:21.769 --> 31:24.587
I sent that sickness into their camps

31:24.599 --> 31:27.611
because your elders came to me
and begged for help.

31:27.678 --> 31:32.571
And in return, the hand of
one of our noble daughters

31:32.590 --> 31:36.652
- to be given to you in marriage.
- My own stipulation.

31:38.805 --> 31:41.524
I never asked be chosen.

31:43.807 --> 31:48.240
When the time came, I couldn't.

31:48.264 --> 31:51.266
I was selfish.
I wanted to live.

31:51.334 --> 31:54.803
Unburden your soul, child.

31:55.321 --> 32:00.279
My father, he saw my fear,

32:01.978 --> 32:07.477
helped me flee,
at the cost of everything...

32:07.501 --> 32:11.360
the love of his people,
his position...

32:14.086 --> 32:15.718
His life.

32:15.742 --> 32:18.592
And what did you give him
in return?

32:21.295 --> 32:22.896
Nothing.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.869
I gave him nothing.

32:33.766 --> 32:38.978
Let him live again
and I will be yours... willingly.

32:42.581 --> 32:46.960
But this business is between us.

32:46.984 --> 32:51.160
You will not harm Sinbad
and the others.

32:51.184 --> 32:53.825
Unless they interfere.

32:53.826 --> 32:58.515
Now is not their time.
It's yours.

33:18.807 --> 33:21.977
Gunnar's nonsense,
Cook's stench of death,

33:22.001 --> 33:24.325
it doesn't make any sense.

33:26.817 --> 33:31.399
All his talk, medicine and science,
he won me over.

33:31.422 --> 33:35.497
Everything about him
goes against what should be.

33:35.521 --> 33:38.516
How can old man be the only survivor

33:38.539 --> 33:41.243
on a ship that must've been
crewed by able-bodied men?

33:41.263 --> 33:43.121
The dead fish?

33:43.145 --> 33:45.975
Weather that transgresses
the laws of nature.

33:45.999 --> 33:50.214
- And there's his name.
- Anicetus?

33:50.237 --> 33:53.355
- Does it mean something?
- Unconquerable.

33:54.329 --> 33:56.584
So?
His parents were optimists.

33:56.607 --> 33:59.190
And this.

34:00.329 --> 34:03.887
In some cultures, the butterfly
symbolizes the unconquerable--

34:03.911 --> 34:06.433
Just say what it is
you want to say.

34:06.456 --> 34:09.098
Speaking as a scientist...

34:10.038 --> 34:12.985
- How could he be?
- Be who?

34:14.453 --> 34:17.444
- Death.
- Death?

34:19.723 --> 34:21.391
In person?

34:22.902 --> 34:25.820
Friend, you are further gone
than I thought you were.

34:25.842 --> 34:27.639
Now who's close-minded?

34:27.663 --> 34:30.342
- At least I haven't lost my mind altogether.
- Let him speak.

34:30.366 --> 34:32.426
For God's sake, if I'd lost my mind,

34:32.449 --> 34:34.715
I'd hardly have a problem with the idea,
would I?

34:34.739 --> 34:36.862
Okay, yeah, fine, fine.

34:36.887 --> 34:39.422
For a moment, let's go with it.

34:39.447 --> 34:42.998
What is death doing on our ship?

34:43.023 --> 34:43.985
Shh.

34:44.009 --> 34:49.719
Ask Nala. If anyone knows
his business here, it's her.

34:49.735 --> 34:53.152
- I've seen her with him.
- She's just lost her father.

34:53.177 --> 34:56.585
You didn't see her face when
she heard about the wedding feast.

34:56.609 --> 34:58.006
Where is Nala?

34:58.018 --> 35:00.035
- She's on deck.
- And the old man?

35:03.524 --> 35:06.242
- Nala!
- Nala!

35:12.715 --> 35:14.449
Death.

35:20.937 --> 35:23.556
It was Death that
her people made a deal with.

35:23.579 --> 35:26.068
She was the price
that they had to pay.

36:34.320 --> 36:37.033
Anyone would be scared of Death.

36:37.051 --> 36:38.495
I wasn't scared.

36:38.562 --> 36:41.433
Concerned.

36:42.877 --> 36:44.401
What fool wouldn't be?

37:05.524 --> 37:11.148
I'll show him who's scared.

37:25.612 --> 37:29.709
To give your father back his life,

37:29.733 --> 37:35.881
you must be my bride
in the union of death.

37:43.392 --> 37:47.320
Nala! Stop!
You don't have to do this!

37:47.343 --> 37:49.014
Protect your master.

38:03.668 --> 38:07.833
- Come with me.
- Nala! No!

38:07.856 --> 38:10.399
If I go,
my father will live again!

38:10.422 --> 38:14.046
No one can return from the land of the dead!
You know that!

38:14.058 --> 38:19.380
Whatever lies he's spun you,
accept your father's gift! Live!

38:19.404 --> 38:22.753
Nala!

38:22.777 --> 38:25.023
Sinbad!

38:25.047 --> 38:27.329
Your father waits.
See?

38:32.469 --> 38:33.636
Nala.

38:36.339 --> 38:37.936
Nala.

38:39.193 --> 38:43.204
He's pleased with your gift...

38:43.228 --> 38:45.834
has seen your tears.

38:45.858 --> 38:48.852
Nala!
It's a trick!

38:51.317 --> 38:57.716
My tears?
The tears I could not cry?

39:05.853 --> 39:09.740
Your people promised me your life.

39:09.763 --> 39:13.182
You don't have a choice!

39:17.256 --> 39:21.281
It's a bargain that must be honoured.

39:21.349 --> 39:24.415
I didn't strike any bargain.

39:24.439 --> 39:27.987
Show me your true face.

40:23.740 --> 40:28.511
Gunnar! Over here!

40:39.289 --> 40:40.956
Cook?

40:45.248 --> 40:48.266
You can't leave us, old friend.

40:51.325 --> 40:54.330
Do you hear that?

41:01.462 --> 41:02.577
It can't be.

41:18.598 --> 41:22.729
Ah...

41:37.257 --> 41:42.065
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
www.addic7ed.com

41:45.920 --> 41:47.352
Run!

41:50.405 --> 41:53.141
- Your friends will die.
- What was that creature?

41:53.757 --> 41:56.106
- Chimera!
- It will kill me.

41:56.786 --> 42:00.297
It won't stop now
until Sinbad is dead.
