00:01.568 --> 00:03.470
Tonight, it's the most
wonderful time of the year

00:03.470 --> 00:05.606
in the Tank.
Hello‐ho‐ho!

00:05.606 --> 00:07.274
Not today, Santa!

00:08.475 --> 00:11.311
Which one of you wants a spot
on Santa's nice list?

00:11.311 --> 00:12.679
Our valuation is awesome.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.147
How much do you make
in one month?

00:14.147 --> 00:15.282
$1.7 million.

00:15.282 --> 00:16.283
‐Ohh.
‐Wow.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.351
You gotta be kidding.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.219
A broken heart
turns to cash flow.

00:19.219 --> 00:20.587
I'm smart.

00:20.587 --> 00:23.524
You are such a shining example
for so many people.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.958
And you make the world
a better place.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.426
Oh, my goodness.

00:26.426 --> 00:28.695
3, 2, 1.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.240
First in the Tank is a business

00:40.240 --> 00:43.610
that seeks to delight
with their magical creatures.

00:51.118 --> 00:53.654
Hey, Sharks.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.622
First of all,
I need to say thank you.

00:55.622 --> 00:57.658
All the years watching
"Shark Tank"

00:57.658 --> 01:00.227
inspired me
to be an entrepreneur.

01:00.227 --> 01:03.931
I turned a hobby I love
into a business.

01:03.931 --> 01:07.401
I'm Wendy Hoffmeister,
owner of Wendy's Gnome Shop.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.403
I'm here seeking $200,000

01:09.403 --> 01:12.606
in exchange for 20% equity
in my company.

01:12.606 --> 01:16.043
We can all use
a little more joy in our life.

01:16.043 --> 01:19.046
So I created Wendy's Gnome Shop!

01:19.046 --> 01:23.216
We make and sell
decorative gnomes for your home,

01:23.216 --> 01:26.053
and gnomes need homes!

01:26.053 --> 01:28.522
They're for all types
of occasions.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.290
They make the perfect gift

01:30.290 --> 01:33.927
to put a smile on someone's face
all year long.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.229
We have
pre‐made birthday gnomes,

01:36.229 --> 01:39.766
graduation gnomes,
sports‐themed gnomes,

01:39.766 --> 01:42.769
and, of course,
gnomes for every holiday.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.705
At Wendy's Gnome Shop,

01:44.705 --> 01:47.474
we love hanging
with the gnomies.

01:50.110 --> 01:54.047
And if our customers
are feeling extra creative,

01:54.047 --> 01:57.784
we have a custom option
called Design‐A‐Gnome.

01:57.784 --> 02:01.688
Our customer designs the gnome
from hat to boot,

02:01.688 --> 02:04.257
choosing their colors and theme,

02:04.257 --> 02:07.060
and we make their vision
come to life.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.763
Now, throughout history,

02:09.763 --> 02:12.766
gnomes have been known
for good luck and prosperity.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.302
So, Sharks, who wants to prosper

02:15.302 --> 02:18.805
and put a gnome in every home
with Wendy's Gnome Shop?

02:19.873 --> 02:21.508
I don't even know
what a gnome is.

02:21.508 --> 02:24.544
So, I designed these
custom gnomes for each of you.

02:24.544 --> 02:25.979
You know, Wendy,
I don't have one.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.314
Mine has a crown.

02:27.314 --> 02:30.117
Barbara, we chose you
to experience Design‐A‐Gnome.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.652
So if you please come up ‐‐
So I have to work for my gnome.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.286
You get to pick it out yourself.

02:33.286 --> 02:35.389
Alright ‐‐
Oh, that's good.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.324
Now, what do people
use these for?

02:37.324 --> 02:40.260
They're just around their home
to make them smile.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.928
The first step I want you to do

02:41.928 --> 02:46.066
is tell me which embellishment
you would like on your hat.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.634
Oh, definitely this.
Sunflower.

02:47.634 --> 02:50.303
So you want the sunflower
on your hat.
Of course. It's the best one.

02:50.303 --> 02:52.105
Then the next thing
is your hat color...

02:52.105 --> 02:53.774
Oh.
...and your little boots.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.309
This beard,
and I'll take a nice red hat.

02:56.309 --> 02:58.745
Perfect. Okay, it'll just
take her a few minutes

02:58.745 --> 02:59.913
to build your gnome.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.982
So I'm ready for questions.

03:01.982 --> 03:05.285
How do you acquire a customer
that wants to buy one of these?

03:05.285 --> 03:08.822
15% is our website,
and about 80% is on Etsy.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.791
So, let's just talk about
your website business.

03:10.791 --> 03:13.026
Have you ever looked at how much
it costs you to get somebody

03:13.026 --> 03:15.328
to actually want to buy one
of these on your own website?

03:15.328 --> 03:17.898
So, our customer acquisition
cost right now,

03:17.898 --> 03:19.099
it's about $5.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.801
What does it cost
to buy a gnome?

03:20.801 --> 03:22.602
Our average price is about $35.

03:22.602 --> 03:24.104
‐$35?
‐$35?

03:24.104 --> 03:25.706
That's what you sell it for?
And what does it cost you
to make one?

03:25.706 --> 03:27.641
$3.50 for materials.
Oh, my God.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.042
‐Great margins.
‐Dang.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.344
Great. Now, but if I said,
look, I have to have a gnome,

03:31.344 --> 03:33.146
Yes.
and I find this gnome expensive,

03:33.146 --> 03:35.148
are there options
that are cheaper?

03:35.148 --> 03:38.318
I compare what's on Etsy.
It's about the same price range.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.787
Do people, like, brush
their gnomes and ‐‐
They do brush them.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.222
Do you sell, like,
gnome brushes?
Comb their gnome.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.690
We tell people that.
Comb your gnome.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.926
Kevin, it'll give you something
to finally comb again!

03:45.926 --> 03:47.360
Comb your gnome.

03:47.360 --> 03:52.365
I'm just ‐‐ I'm amazed
people pay $35 for this.

03:52.365 --> 03:53.767
They absolutely love them.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.103
Wendy, I want to understand
the gnome market, right?

03:56.103 --> 03:58.338
'Cause I wasn't even ‐‐
You didn't read that study,

03:58.338 --> 04:00.774
the research that came out
recently on the gnome market?

04:00.774 --> 04:02.676
Yeah. But ‐‐

04:02.676 --> 04:04.911
So, gnomes, people love them.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.913
They have an emotional
connection with them.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.849
They make them smile
and feel good.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.184
So, what have your sales
been to date?

04:11.184 --> 04:13.620
So, I've been in business
18 months,

04:13.620 --> 04:16.790
and my sales are
$688,000 lifetime.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.625
‐Whoa.
‐You gotta be kidding.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.360
‐With these little things?
‐Yes, sir.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.295
‐People like gnomes.
‐They must be good luck.

04:22.295 --> 04:24.264
If I go online
and look for gnomes,

04:24.264 --> 04:26.433
there must be lots
of doll gnomes.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.801
I do have some competition.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.603
They do have
some factory‐produced gnomes

04:29.603 --> 04:31.772
that are more like
stuffed animals.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.573
Mine are much better quality.

04:33.573 --> 04:36.710
I am the top gnome seller
on all of Etsy.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.679
I've sold over 23,000 of them.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.214
You have?!
Yes.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.049
This is super impressive.

04:43.049 --> 04:44.551
You started your hobby

04:44.551 --> 04:46.086
in 18 months.
Yes.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.388
Almost hitting $700,000.

04:48.388 --> 04:49.422
Yes.

04:49.422 --> 04:50.924
How did you do that?

04:50.924 --> 04:55.428
Two years ago ‐‐
Two years ago today, actually,

04:55.428 --> 04:58.598
me and the love of my life,
our relationship ended.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.433
And I was pretty heartbroken,

05:00.433 --> 05:04.104
and I needed something to make
me smile, and I needed a hobby.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.006
I made a gnome,
and I thought it was cute.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.074
And I put it on Etsy,
and it sold the next day.

05:08.074 --> 05:09.843
And I made some more,
and they sold.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.312
So it was just like
a spontaneous kind of thing.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.015
Did you always love gnomes?
So that person
did you a huge favor.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.217
A broken heart
turns to cash flow.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.986
Wendy, we've established that
you're the Gnome Goddess, right?

05:19.986 --> 05:20.987
Yes.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.355
The question becomes,

05:22.355 --> 05:24.357
how much did you invest
to start this business?

05:24.357 --> 05:25.892
And are you profitable?

05:25.892 --> 05:28.829
To start this business,
I started with less than $1,000.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.363
‐Yeah. Good job.
‐Wow.

05:30.363 --> 05:31.698
The power of broke, baby.

05:31.698 --> 05:34.134
Exactly.
That's only a 668 times return,

05:34.134 --> 05:35.335
but, you know, who's counting?
Yes.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.603
And we're profitable.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.038
So, last year,

05:38.038 --> 05:40.473
we netted $135,000.

05:40.473 --> 05:41.842
There you go!
Okay.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.210
‐That's great.
‐Who's we?

05:43.210 --> 05:45.045
How many people do you have
in this business?
Me!

05:45.045 --> 05:48.215
So, I have three ladies that
work for me, and my daughter.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.716
Barbara's gnome
is complete.

05:49.716 --> 05:52.385
Look at that.
I love it!

05:52.385 --> 05:53.753
Wow.

05:53.753 --> 05:55.455
It's darling.
I now get it.

05:55.455 --> 05:57.891
I feel immediately
motherly toward it.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.527
Wendy, what's your background?

06:00.527 --> 06:02.195
I was a nurse was my background,

06:02.195 --> 06:04.731
and, you know, I worked
for a community‐based program,

06:04.731 --> 06:07.601
so I helped women in labor,
and I loved it so much.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.903
So then I decided
at 35 years old

06:09.903 --> 06:11.705
to enroll in college
for the first time

06:11.705 --> 06:13.206
to be a labor and delivery
nurse.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.375
‐Wow.
‐Yeah, that's amazing.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.610
And I'm just curious,

06:16.610 --> 06:18.745
lovely daughter gnome
over there,

06:18.745 --> 06:21.314
how do you feel about your mom
and what she's accomplished?

06:21.314 --> 06:24.718
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so proud, so over the moon.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.653
She's a huge inspiration.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.221
Yeah, she's ‐‐ Yeah.
We're both nurses,

06:28.221 --> 06:30.724
and we both have retired
from nursing to make gnomes.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.660
This is an incredible story.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.629
The product is ‐‐

06:35.629 --> 06:37.664
I don't ‐‐ I don't know
what to tell you about it.

06:37.664 --> 06:41.501
I mean, it's ‐‐ You know,
I really respect sales.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.737
But I don't need a gnome
in my portfolio.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.139
I really don't.
And so I'm out.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.841
Okay. Thank you.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.743
You have
a thriving business,

06:49.743 --> 06:51.878
and you deserve
some serious credit for that.

06:51.878 --> 06:52.879
Thank you.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.648
This isn't the right
business for me,

06:54.648 --> 06:58.518
but I think it's really cute,
and I'm super happy for you.

06:58.518 --> 06:59.552
I'm out.

07:00.553 --> 07:01.621
Thank you so much.

07:01.621 --> 07:03.223
Yeah, Gnome Goddess,
I just got to tell you,

07:03.223 --> 07:06.927
I mean, you are such a shining
example for so many people.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.397
You take $3.50,
you sell one,

07:10.397 --> 07:12.032
which leads to two,
which leads to

07:12.032 --> 07:15.268
$674,000 or whatever
in sales.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.803
It's great. Yeah.

07:16.803 --> 07:19.472
Yeah, and I think I can grow it
so much more.

07:19.472 --> 07:21.775
I have no doubt.
But, really,

07:21.775 --> 07:24.244
you're a niche
category, right?

07:24.244 --> 07:26.680
It's not a $5 million
or $10 million business.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.148
It's a great business
for you,

07:28.148 --> 07:30.150
but it's not something
I want to invest in.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.652
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.487
Wendy, I ‐‐

07:34.487 --> 07:37.424
Where can I add value to you,
or anybody here?

07:37.424 --> 07:39.125
So, I definitely feel like,
you know,

07:39.125 --> 07:40.493
I want a strategic partner.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.662
I think if I had someone
that has marketing expertise,

07:42.662 --> 07:43.964
SEO knowledge,

07:43.964 --> 07:45.765
can really grow this business.

07:45.765 --> 07:47.968
I've decreased the cost
of making a gnome

07:47.968 --> 07:52.072
by 50% since I started
by learning to source materials,

07:52.072 --> 07:54.708
but I think I can improve that
to even scale it more.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.443
And I think someone
with your experience

07:56.443 --> 07:58.678
can help me with those things.

07:58.678 --> 08:01.047
Well, I think I can
help you. I ‐‐

08:01.047 --> 08:03.283
I want to
give you an offer.

08:03.283 --> 08:06.186
You're asking $200,000
for 20%.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.787
$200,000 for 35%.

08:07.787 --> 08:10.457
That's my offer.

08:10.457 --> 08:13.693
I think the hair on that gnome
is falling off now.

08:13.693 --> 08:15.328
You can counter, Wendy.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.365
Well, before you counter, Wendy,
let me ask you a few questions.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.866
I don't know the gnome business.

08:19.866 --> 08:23.203
So, is this something in the
last few years people are into,

08:23.203 --> 08:25.638
or they have been into gnomes
from the beginning of time?

08:25.638 --> 08:27.540
Forever.
Gnomes have been around forever.

08:27.540 --> 08:31.411
Okay, my next question is
you had $688,000 in sales,

08:31.411 --> 08:33.980
but you only had
$135,000 profit.

08:33.980 --> 08:37.017
That strikes me like
your overhead is way too high.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.185
What are you spending that money
on every month?

08:39.185 --> 08:42.322
Right, so, a lot of that
actually is Etsy fees.

08:42.322 --> 08:45.191
So that's why I'm trying to
draw more people to the website.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.795
You know what? I had a business
that was usually successful

08:48.795 --> 08:50.363
from the get‐go, Grace and Lace,

08:50.363 --> 08:52.766
and they sold 90%
of their merchandise on Etsy.

08:52.766 --> 08:53.967
Yeah.
But I learned

08:53.967 --> 08:55.368
from working with that business

08:55.368 --> 08:57.837
the importance of taking control
of your own customer base.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.372
I've done it with Holiball.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.974
I've done it with Hire Santa.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.777
And it's a lion's effort
to build up your own club,

09:03.777 --> 09:05.245
to get those people
coming directly to you.

09:05.245 --> 09:08.681
But you must if you want to
control your business.

09:08.681 --> 09:11.885
So I'm going to make you
an offer of 30%

09:11.885 --> 09:14.421
for $200,000,
but I want a buck a gnome.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.525
So a royalty, a gnome royalty.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.560
I'm not calling it a royalty.
I'm calling it a buck a gnome.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.095
But that's what it is.
A buck a gnome.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.496
It's a royalty.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.166
You know, we can make it
more interesting.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.935
$200,000, 30%,

09:28.935 --> 09:32.605
50 cents per gnome sold
until you pay back the money,

09:32.605 --> 09:35.442
and then we go straight to
just a 30% equity position.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.476
Okay.

09:36.476 --> 09:39.379
And I'm dropping
the $1 per gnome.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.581
So just 30%.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.882
‐No royalty.
‐No royalty.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.250
Wow, that's interesting, Wendy.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.485
Now you've really got
a competition going on here.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.287
I know. I see that.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.155
What are you gonna do, Wendy?

09:53.059 --> 09:55.929
Oh, my goodness.

10:04.404 --> 10:05.972
Three Sharks are out.

10:05.972 --> 10:10.110
Daymond has offered Wendy
$200,000 for a 30% stake

10:10.110 --> 10:13.480
in her custom gnome business,
Wendy's Gnome Shop.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.748
But he also wants
a 50‐cent royalty

10:15.748 --> 10:18.151
until his investment is repaid.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.387
Barbara has undercut Daymond
by offering the same deal

10:21.387 --> 10:22.922
without the royalty.

10:22.922 --> 10:24.457
What are you gonna do, Wendy?

10:24.457 --> 10:27.127
Oh, my goodness.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.129
So, Daymond, will you do that?

10:29.129 --> 10:30.563
The same thing?

10:30.563 --> 10:32.732
Are you playing us
against each other, Wendy?

10:32.732 --> 10:35.001
She's the Gnome Goddess.
Why would she not?

10:35.001 --> 10:36.736
I'm smart.

10:36.736 --> 10:38.304
‐Yeah!
‐Yeah, you are.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.306
Why do you feel
that we should keep

10:40.306 --> 10:42.375
negotiating against ourselves?

10:42.375 --> 10:43.676
Because this business
is worth it.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.078
You're gonna make
lots of money.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.279
What do you believe
you will make this year

10:46.279 --> 10:47.547
and net this year?

10:47.547 --> 10:50.016
So, my revenue will be
$750,000 this year,

10:50.016 --> 10:51.684
and I will net $150,000.

10:51.684 --> 10:53.486
So, out of $150,000 at 30%,

10:53.486 --> 10:56.256
then I would have made $50,000.
Yes.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.158
25% of your capital back.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.692
Not a bad deal, Daymond.

10:59.692 --> 11:01.294
You know, Wendy ‐‐
Not a bad deal. I'll match it.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.996
I'll match it.
I'll match her deal.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.498
30% for $200,000.
Honest to God, I don't care
when the money comes back.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.634
It's not where
my head is at on this.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.435
I'm just very ‐‐
No royalty.

11:09.435 --> 11:12.105
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. I was finishing
my thought, Barbara.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.806
You want a rude person like that
being your partner?

11:13.806 --> 11:15.775
Oh, my goodness, gracious!

11:15.775 --> 11:17.310
And I'm gonna tell you
one other thing.

11:17.310 --> 11:20.713
Your enemy is your reliance
on outside websites,

11:20.713 --> 11:23.082
and I know how to take it
right off the outside

11:23.082 --> 11:24.751
and give you the power
within your shop.

11:24.751 --> 11:26.586
So, not like
I don't have Bombas,

11:26.586 --> 11:28.254
the #1 brand
in "Shark Tank" history

11:28.254 --> 11:30.890
that sells direct like that,
so I can do the same.

11:30.890 --> 11:34.060
You have two options.
Just pick one.

11:34.060 --> 11:38.631
I want to counter
with 25% for $200,000.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.366
‐To both of them.
‐Yes.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.369
No, I won't
go that far. No.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.673
I won't, either.
I'm sorry.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.008
Wow.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.347
What are you gonna do,
Wendy?

11:57.584 --> 11:59.385
Daymond.
That's my gnomie!

11:59.385 --> 12:00.920
‐Yeah!
‐Aw.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.355
Come on. Come on.
Give it up. Give it up.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.657
Oh, my God.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.192
Thank you so much.
Congratulations.

12:06.192 --> 12:07.794
Yeah!
Way to go, Wendy!

12:07.794 --> 12:09.195
Way to go!
Congratulations, Gnome Goddess.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.230
Well done.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.899
Oh, they're so cute.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.735
I cannot believe it.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.737
I don't know. Just
in the moment, it spoke to me.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.472
Like, originally,
I was thinking Barbara,

12:19.472 --> 12:21.874
and then I was like Daymond ‐‐
Daymond's it.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.142
That's perfect.
It's perfect.

12:23.142 --> 12:24.844
I'm so ‐‐
I'm so happy.
I can't believe it.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.679
Perfect.
Good job, Mama.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.514
Barb, the only thing
that I think was the difference

12:28.514 --> 12:30.350
between you and I
was that you didn't even

12:30.350 --> 12:31.951
know exactly what they were.
No, I didn't know.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.386
I'm embarrassed. You know,
I never heard of a gnome.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.887
Excuse me. I have a different
question for both of you.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.789
What the hell are you thinking?

12:36.789 --> 12:39.058
I think that there is...

12:39.058 --> 12:41.294
You can't argue
with the numbers.
...mail‐a‐potato.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.795
Yeah.
Yeah.

12:42.795 --> 12:44.864
You know, silly deals like that.
Buy‐a‐gnome.

12:44.864 --> 12:47.000
And there's deals like this
that don't rot.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.103
Oh, no!

12:53.339 --> 12:56.242
In Season 12, cousins
Kristy, Jennifer, and Amberly

12:56.242 --> 12:58.411
made a deal with Mark Cuban
and Barbara Corcoran

12:58.411 --> 13:01.114
for their giant inflatable
Christmas ornament company,

13:01.114 --> 13:02.248
Holiball.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.850
You can hang them,
stake them, sit them,

13:03.850 --> 13:05.151
and even float them.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.987
Let's see what they're up to
this holiday season.

13:07.987 --> 13:09.689
It's the most
wonderful time of the year,

13:09.689 --> 13:12.659
and we've been busy
making your Christmas bolder...

13:12.659 --> 13:14.460
Brighter...
And ballsier...

13:14.460 --> 13:16.162
Than ever before.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.164
Last year,
it was just the three of us

13:18.164 --> 13:20.667
packaging every single Holiball
that went out.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.702
Mark was able to provide us
the cash flow

13:22.702 --> 13:25.705
to move our packaging to
a fulfillment center in Dallas.

13:25.705 --> 13:28.207
Barbara has been able to use her
sales and marketing expertise

13:28.207 --> 13:30.343
to drive traffic
and boost sales.

13:30.343 --> 13:33.913
We are now able to spend the
time needed to grow our brand.

13:33.913 --> 13:38.017
But as the busiest sales time
of our season was approaching,

13:38.017 --> 13:40.286
we fell victim
to an online attack.

13:40.286 --> 13:43.256
Our banking information
was changed,

13:43.256 --> 13:45.124
and they rerouted pay‐outs.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.260
We lost hundreds
of thousands of dollars

13:47.260 --> 13:49.829
during one of the most
critical points in our business.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.565
We've had to persevere,
but we love this product.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.600
We believe in it.
We stand behind it.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.703
After updating
our security system,

13:56.703 --> 13:57.704
we are up and running

13:57.704 --> 13:59.405
just in time
for the holiday season.

13:59.405 --> 14:02.675
We are not gonna let any Grinch
steal our Holiball cheer.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.611
It's a lesson for
every young business out there

14:05.611 --> 14:07.747
to have some kind
of protection in place,

14:07.747 --> 14:09.849
to have security protocols
in place

14:09.849 --> 14:12.585
and watch your back
to see those hacks coming.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.420
We want other
small businesses to know,

14:14.420 --> 14:17.290
the best way to protect yourself
is to do your research.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.425
Make sure that
the platform you're using

14:19.425 --> 14:22.362
protects you
against hacks and fraud.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.263
And make sure that you have
cyber insurance

14:24.263 --> 14:26.499
that can cover you
in situations like these

14:26.499 --> 14:27.967
to help recoup the money.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.269
I have never seen a business
that's taken a hard hit

14:30.269 --> 14:32.638
that was worthy
that didn't bounce back up.

14:32.638 --> 14:35.475
And if I'm reading you guys
right, you're that type.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.945
I say you double those earnings
within the next six months.

14:38.945 --> 14:41.047
It seems unbelievable,
but I believe you will.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.081
Thank you, Barb.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.150
Thank you.
Thank you.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.985
Happy Holiball.
Cheers.

14:45.985 --> 14:49.389
Before "Shark Tank,"
our sales were at $117,000.

14:49.389 --> 14:53.426
Now our lifetime sales
are $4.4 million.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.495
We are still in awe
of the success

14:55.495 --> 14:57.196
that "Shark Tank"
has given our company.

14:57.196 --> 14:58.998
Now that we're able to hire
more people,

14:58.998 --> 15:01.567
we'll be able to spend more time
with our families this year,

15:01.567 --> 15:03.035
and that's
the best part of it.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.704
Happy Holiball!

15:16.449 --> 15:17.617
Next up is a way

15:17.617 --> 15:20.386
to keep your most precious
ornaments safe.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.964
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Mika'il.

15:31.964 --> 15:33.900
I'm Ayaan.
I'm Sofia.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.635
I'm Amanda.
I'm Hamza.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.103
We're the Naqvi family.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.272
And today, we're here
with Ornament Anchor,

15:39.272 --> 15:40.773
the smartest, easiest,

15:40.773 --> 15:42.542
and best way
to hang your ornaments...

15:42.542 --> 15:44.343
Hands down. Hands down.
Hands down. Hands down.

15:44.343 --> 15:47.246
If we look familiar, it's
because we've been here before.

15:47.246 --> 15:48.548
Take a look.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.851
<i>Kudo Banz starts
with a storybook.</i>

15:51.851 --> 15:54.821
<i>At the end of the story,
they get a cool band to wear</i>

15:54.821 --> 15:56.322
<i>and earn Kudos
for good listening.</i>

15:56.322 --> 15:57.590
<i>That's a lot of money
for something</i>

15:57.590 --> 15:58.958
<i>that isn't making
any money yet, but ‐‐</i>

15:58.958 --> 16:00.526
<i>Our margins are huge,
though.</i>

16:00.526 --> 16:02.061
<i>Our valuation is fair.</i>

16:02.061 --> 16:03.896
I remember this kid.
<i>I just think
it's too early.</i>

16:03.896 --> 16:06.199
<i>I can't go down the path
with you.</i>

16:06.199 --> 16:07.667
<i>I'm out.</i>

16:07.667 --> 16:09.669
<i>You're doing better than most
of the adults that pitch here.</i>

16:09.669 --> 16:11.003
<i>They're gonna regret this.</i>

16:11.003 --> 16:12.572
<i>They're definitely gonna
regret this.</i>

16:15.241 --> 16:17.944
Don't worry. We're still
your biggest fans.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.579
It's our dream to get a deal.

16:19.579 --> 16:22.248
So we're back
seeking $90,000

16:22.248 --> 16:25.751
for 5% of our
ornament‐saving business.

16:25.751 --> 16:28.254
Sharks, we all know
ornaments are fragile,

16:28.254 --> 16:30.256
and even just
bumping into the tree

16:30.256 --> 16:32.959
can make your ornaments
fall and break.

16:32.959 --> 16:37.430
Not to mention if you have
dogs or cats.

16:37.430 --> 16:40.733
Flimsy hooks and simple ribbons
just don't work.

16:40.733 --> 16:44.303
They only drape over a branch
waiting for accidents to happen.

16:44.303 --> 16:46.038
It's about time
this changed.

16:46.038 --> 16:48.808
By actually anchoring ornaments
to the branch,

16:48.808 --> 16:52.111
Ornament Anchor keeps
your memories safe and secure.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.682
This is an ornament that Ayaan
made when he was 2 years old.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.518
I'd be really upset
if it broke.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.953
To secure it,
I simply take Ornament Anchor,

17:00.953 --> 17:03.923
and I put it
through the hole.

17:03.923 --> 17:07.593
Then I pull it up and over.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.195
I find a branch...

17:10.663 --> 17:12.365
...put it on...

17:12.365 --> 17:13.366
and pull.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.634
That's it.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.936
With Ornament Anchor,
you'll never have to worry

17:16.936 --> 17:20.172
about another precious memory
being broken on the floor.

17:20.172 --> 17:22.275
Ornament Anchor can hold
up to 10 pounds

17:22.275 --> 17:25.077
so you feel confident
your ornaments are secure.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.312
And you'll never have to worry

17:26.312 --> 17:30.249
about pets knocking off
your ornaments again.

17:30.249 --> 17:32.051
Now it's time to put
Ornament Anchor

17:32.051 --> 17:33.686
to the ultimate test.

17:33.686 --> 17:34.921
Goggles, everyone.

17:34.921 --> 17:37.056
That's including you,
Sharks.

17:42.528 --> 17:45.898
Our most precious ornaments
are right here on this tree,

17:45.898 --> 17:47.400
so the stakes are high.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.068
Okay, Lori,
when I say go,

17:49.068 --> 17:51.337
can you press that bright red
button in front of you?

17:51.337 --> 17:52.705
Okay. Mm‐hmm.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.741
3, 2, 1.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.843
Go!

17:57.843 --> 17:59.579
‐Wow.
‐Oh.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.913
‐Whew!
‐Whoa.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.082
Wow. Pretty impressive.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.018
Sharks, with your help,
we can all save Christmas

18:06.018 --> 18:08.154
one ornament at a time
with...

18:08.154 --> 18:09.789
Ornament Anchor!

18:11.324 --> 18:13.559
We have samples for all of you,
so you guys can unwrap

18:13.559 --> 18:15.962
those special ornaments
we made you.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.863
You know, you can shake them
around on their branch,

18:17.863 --> 18:21.133
'cause we are sure
that they won't come off.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.235
So, you guys are quite
the family of entrepreneurs.

18:23.235 --> 18:25.538
Yeah.
What happened to the last one

18:25.538 --> 18:27.506
that made you
get into this one?

18:27.506 --> 18:30.843
Well, Sharks, Kudo Banz was
one of the, you know ‐‐

18:30.843 --> 18:32.478
the most important
things in our lives,

18:32.478 --> 18:34.146
and it certainly
got us here.

18:34.146 --> 18:37.316
You know, I'll take it
to a baseball analogy.

18:37.316 --> 18:39.852
Sometimes you have, you know,
singles and doubles,

18:39.852 --> 18:42.088
but we're really here today
with Ornament Anchor,

18:42.088 --> 18:44.056
and we know it's going
to hit a home run.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.391
But last time,
the problem you had

18:45.391 --> 18:47.727
was your valuation was insane.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.062
Well, did you learn anything
from that last ‐‐

18:50.062 --> 18:52.331
Of course we did.
Constructive criticism?

18:52.331 --> 18:53.666
Yes. Yes, Sharks, we did,

18:53.666 --> 18:57.136
and our valuation
is awesome this time.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.672
How did you come up with this,
and was it a family thing?

18:59.672 --> 19:01.374
Well, Lori, I came up
with Ornament Anchor

19:01.374 --> 19:03.442
when I was in fourth grade
from a school project.

19:03.442 --> 19:05.411
‐Oh.
‐I was just sitting around
my Christmas tree,

19:05.411 --> 19:07.313
trying to come up with
an invention,

19:07.313 --> 19:08.514
and I thought to myself,

19:08.514 --> 19:10.483
"Every year, we break
two to three ornaments."

19:10.483 --> 19:12.918
And I thought,
"There has to be a solution."

19:12.918 --> 19:15.388
So I created a prototype, and
when I went to the school fair,

19:15.388 --> 19:18.024
everyone swarmed my booth
asking if they could buy some.

19:18.024 --> 19:21.227
All the grandmas, moms, kids,
everyone loved it.

19:21.227 --> 19:24.764
Okay. Now, last time you were
here, the problem was valuation.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.332
We've established that.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.334
Today, it's $90,000 for 5%,

19:28.334 --> 19:30.670
imputes a $1.8 million value.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.871
Yes.
Bingo.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.440
Why is this product
worth $1.8 million?

19:34.440 --> 19:37.076
So, the first thing I'll run you
through ‐‐ sales.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.944
Our first year
during the pandemic,

19:38.944 --> 19:41.781
we made $312,000 in sales.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.915
‐Very good.
‐Wow.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.483
And this June,
in a summer month ‐‐

19:44.483 --> 19:46.318
Sharks, this is
a Christmas product ‐‐

19:46.318 --> 19:48.521
we made $80,000 in sales,

19:48.521 --> 19:52.058
which brings our lifetime total
in just 18 short months

19:52.058 --> 19:53.993
to over half a million dollars
in sales.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.461
Good for you.
But you know

19:55.461 --> 19:57.897
there's a big difference
between sales and profits.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.165
Yes.
Yes, sir, we do.

19:59.165 --> 20:01.434
You are gonna love
our profit margins, Mark.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.436
Landed, a pack
of 24 Ornament Anchors

20:03.436 --> 20:05.905
cost us $1.50 to make.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.708
And we sell at MSRP
for $24.99...

20:08.708 --> 20:09.942
Wow.
...which means our

20:09.942 --> 20:12.511
direct‐to‐consumer
profit margins are 94%,

20:12.511 --> 20:13.979
and our wholesale
profit margins are 70%.

20:13.979 --> 20:16.682
What percentage of your sales ‐‐
You sell one bag for $24.95?

20:16.682 --> 20:18.184
MSRP.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.486
So it's almost like
this could be more expensive

20:20.486 --> 20:23.055
than the ornament I put on
my tree, each one of these.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.824
Yes, Barbara,
but believe it or not,

20:24.824 --> 20:28.127
we did a really big survey
of all of our customers,

20:28.127 --> 20:29.395
and all of
our customers said

20:29.395 --> 20:31.197
it was at a perfect
price point for them

20:31.197 --> 20:33.065
because they were
saving, you know, memories.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.400
They were saving
their ornaments.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.670
I mean, people are willing
to also put in the investment.

20:37.670 --> 20:41.373
It's an insurance policy
for your greatest memories.

20:41.373 --> 20:44.043
Mom and Dad, are you
working on the business,

20:44.043 --> 20:45.845
or you got
your day jobs, as well?

20:45.845 --> 20:49.014
So, since this is such
a success, I'm full‐time in it

20:49.014 --> 20:51.217
in terms of
finding the buyers,

20:51.217 --> 20:53.452
and then the two
are pitching and closing.

20:53.452 --> 20:54.687
They closed Target.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.288
They closed Nordstrom.
But are you running it?

20:56.288 --> 20:58.090
I'm running operations...

20:58.090 --> 20:59.592
He's just running ‐‐ Yeah.
...fulfilling orders,

20:59.592 --> 21:02.094
making sure that everything
is going smoothly

21:02.094 --> 21:04.296
in terms of customer service.
And you have no other job?

21:04.296 --> 21:06.999
You know, we come from a really
long line of entrepreneurs.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.667
We have other businesses
that we run and ‐‐

21:08.667 --> 21:10.269
So, wait, you can't
be full‐time...
Do you mind me asking

21:10.269 --> 21:11.737
what are the other businesses?
...and have other business.

21:11.737 --> 21:13.105
We still have Kudo Banz.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.974
So, Kudo Banz is still
running today,

21:14.974 --> 21:16.075
still doing great.

21:16.075 --> 21:18.210
And we had another venture

21:18.210 --> 21:21.247
that we hopped into
during the pandemic.

21:21.247 --> 21:23.249
We decided we wanted to be
a gaming family,

21:23.249 --> 21:26.252
so we put something up,
and we started selling games.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.120
Yeah, card games.
So, we do that, as well.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.357
So we ‐‐ You know,
we're entrepreneurs

21:31.357 --> 21:32.925
all the time,
basically.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.560
But, Sharks,

21:34.560 --> 21:36.595
this is the most
power‐packed team

21:36.595 --> 21:38.464
you're going to get ever
on this show. We ‐‐

21:38.464 --> 21:40.099
You know what, guys?
I love you guys.

21:40.099 --> 21:41.400
We live and breathe ‐‐
But this is not

21:41.400 --> 21:44.403
the most power‐packed team
we're going to get.

21:44.403 --> 21:46.105
There's a lot of moving parts.

21:46.105 --> 21:48.641
The business I think
you guys are in is getting on TV

21:48.641 --> 21:49.842
and selling, right?
Oh ‐‐

21:49.842 --> 21:51.443
There's nothing wrong with that.
Absolutely not.

21:51.443 --> 21:52.878
That's a good business.
This is a problem
solution product.

21:52.878 --> 21:55.347
But you've got three different
companies, right? At least.

21:55.347 --> 21:58.150
Yeah. But you guys all invest
in lots of different companies.
There's too many moving parts.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.718
Wait, Mom, Mom ‐‐
I got this. I got this.

21:59.718 --> 22:02.655
There's too many moving parts,
so I'm out.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.557
Thank you ‐‐
Thank you, Mark, for your time.
You're welcome.

22:04.557 --> 22:06.525
Alright, guys,
I look at this and say

22:06.525 --> 22:08.761
fantastic product,
huge margins,

22:08.761 --> 22:11.630
but also, this is
an extremely seasonal product.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.299
And, you know, I look
at my portfolio of companies,

22:13.299 --> 22:14.533
I don't do seasonal products,

22:14.533 --> 22:16.402
'cause I want to sell stuff
all year long.

22:16.402 --> 22:18.237
I'm sorry, guys.
I mean, you're terrific.

22:18.237 --> 22:21.006
You come out here,
and you pitch hard. It's great.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.542
But this is not
a deal for me. I'm out.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.277
Thank you, Kevin, for your time.
Thank you, Kevin.

22:25.277 --> 22:26.545
But ‐‐
Okay, guys.

22:26.545 --> 22:29.148
This business is not for me.
I'm out.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.985
Okay. Thank you, Daymond,
for your time.

22:32.985 --> 22:36.822
I have to say, you guys
are incredibly impressive.

22:36.822 --> 22:39.658
Your passion is intense.

22:39.658 --> 22:42.061
I do believe
that you could sell anything.

22:42.061 --> 22:44.330
I know the product works,
and it's good,

22:44.330 --> 22:46.699
but I don't think
it's investable for me,

22:46.699 --> 22:50.402
as it's a one‐off item
that does one function

22:50.402 --> 22:51.737
that is seasonal.

22:51.737 --> 22:54.673
Sadly, it's just not
broad enough for me.

22:54.673 --> 22:56.709
Well, Lori, we ‐‐
And so I wish you good luck,

22:56.709 --> 22:59.044
but I'm out.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.379
Thank you, Lori,
for your time,

23:00.379 --> 23:02.915
but we actually have ‐‐
One Shark left, The Grinch.

23:03.949 --> 23:05.284
Barbara.
Barbara.

23:05.284 --> 23:08.320
I'll tell you what I loved
about the entire scene.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.055
I love the confidence
of your children.

23:10.055 --> 23:13.392
Thank you. Thank you so much.
That means the most.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.695
But I'm actually shocked
people are paying 25 bucks,

23:16.695 --> 23:19.365
times two for a tree, $50?

23:19.365 --> 23:21.300
I have a lot of money,
I wouldn't pay $50.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.269
I would just rather
lose a few ornaments.

23:23.269 --> 23:24.737
But my biggest concern

23:24.737 --> 23:26.672
is the hopping from business
to business.

23:26.672 --> 23:28.974
I really like someone
who has an idea,

23:28.974 --> 23:30.843
sticks with it
through hell or high water.

23:30.843 --> 23:33.612
Then invest in us, Barbara.
Well, Barbara, we're
laser‐focused on Ornament Anch‐‐

23:33.612 --> 23:35.547
It's the only thing that we've
been doing all this time.

23:35.547 --> 23:37.516
For the moment, I think you're
laser‐focused on ornaments,

23:37.516 --> 23:39.518
but I think maybe
this time next year,

23:39.518 --> 23:40.586
it might be something else.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.655
So because of my
mistrust of that,

23:42.655 --> 23:44.823
even though I adore you,
I'm out.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.596
To use a baseball analogy,
you've gone down swinging.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.431
We'll give you credit for that.
Good luck, guys.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.033
We do appreciate it. Thank you.
Good job, guys. Good luck.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.234
Thank you.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.673
We wish a Shark could have been
along with us on the ride,

24:00.673 --> 24:01.907
but we know for a fact

24:01.907 --> 24:03.575
that Ornament Anchor's
going to be a big name.

24:03.575 --> 24:06.111
It's going to be in every single
Christmas tree

24:06.111 --> 24:07.813
in America.
And worldwide.

24:07.813 --> 24:10.749
And this <i>is</i> the most
power‐packed team

24:10.749 --> 24:11.750
you are going to get.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.419
The Sharks missed out.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.499
Next in the Tank is
a veteran in the holiday game,

24:27.499 --> 24:29.735
bringing joy
to children everywhere.

24:37.009 --> 24:40.145
Well, hello‐ho‐ho!

24:40.145 --> 24:43.182
Sharks, my name is Santa Claus,

24:43.182 --> 24:45.250
and today, I'm asking ‐‐

24:45.250 --> 24:46.685
Oh, no!

24:46.685 --> 24:49.088
Not today, Santa!

24:49.088 --> 24:52.758
Hello, Sharks,
and happy holidays!

24:52.758 --> 24:56.228
I'm Tommy, the Real Elf,
and I bring joy to the world

24:56.228 --> 25:00.165
through peace, love, and Elfies.

25:00.165 --> 25:03.068
Alright, Santa.
This is my time to shine.

25:03.068 --> 25:05.304
Have some milk and cookies
over there.

25:06.972 --> 25:08.273
Whew!

25:08.273 --> 25:09.775
Here's the deal, Sharks.

25:09.775 --> 25:11.910
The big guy, he gets busy.

25:11.910 --> 25:13.946
And as the Real Elf,

25:13.946 --> 25:16.382
I've found a way
to spark a little joy

25:16.382 --> 25:20.919
that's available to everyone
around the world anytime

25:20.919 --> 25:22.921
with Elf Grams,

25:22.921 --> 25:25.391
personalized holiday
digital messages.

25:25.391 --> 25:27.226
No matter what you celebrate,

25:27.226 --> 25:29.261
you can log on
to the Real Elf website

25:29.261 --> 25:32.297
and order a personalized holiday
Elf Gram from me,

25:32.297 --> 25:35.300
the one and only Real Elf.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.302
But that's not all.

25:37.302 --> 25:40.339
Hire me for your next
corporate event,

25:40.339 --> 25:42.608
private party...

25:45.310 --> 25:48.213
...or media appearance.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.281
Oh.

25:51.683 --> 25:55.154
I'm offering 25%
of what's in my stocking

25:55.154 --> 25:58.891
in exchange for
125,000 chestnuts ‐‐

25:58.891 --> 26:01.860
I mean dollars!

26:01.860 --> 26:03.862
Real money to create a platform

26:03.862 --> 26:06.698
and expand
the Real Elf business.

26:06.698 --> 26:09.068
So, Sharks, you'll be sorry

26:09.068 --> 26:11.470
if you miss out
on this opportunity.

26:11.470 --> 26:14.206
So let's make magic happen!

26:14.206 --> 26:16.341
Whoa!
Now, all of you, come on up

26:16.341 --> 26:19.144
and get your first‐ever
Shark Elfie!

26:20.512 --> 26:21.580
Here we go.

26:22.848 --> 26:24.683
Ho, ho, ho, ho!
Alright.

26:24.683 --> 26:27.686
Everybody say Elfie.

26:28.787 --> 26:33.459
Elfie! Elfie!
Elfie! Elfie!

26:33.459 --> 26:34.860
Thanks, Santa.

26:34.860 --> 26:37.763
You're welcome, Tommy.
Good luck with the pitch.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.598
‐Thanks, Elfie.
‐Thank you.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.333
Thank you, Santa.

26:41.333 --> 26:45.104
Merry Christmas, everybody!
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

26:45.104 --> 26:47.906
Okay, so, Tommy,
what is the business?

26:47.906 --> 26:51.443
So, I go around the world,
and I take Elfies.

26:51.443 --> 26:54.880
You can hire me,
or you can have an Elf Gram,

26:54.880 --> 26:57.916
or I also have curated Elf swag.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.385
What's a Elfie Gram, though?

27:00.385 --> 27:02.254
I'm trying to understand
the model.

27:02.254 --> 27:05.324
So you have a digital model,
as well as in‐person?

27:05.324 --> 27:07.059
Correct. This last season,

27:07.059 --> 27:10.295
I partnered with an organization
called Imerman Angels.

27:10.295 --> 27:13.232
They are free,
one‐on‐one cancer support.

27:13.232 --> 27:16.435
So partnering up, they allowed
me to create a website

27:16.435 --> 27:17.836
where someone put in a request,

27:17.836 --> 27:20.772
and then I was able
to give them a custom message.

27:20.772 --> 27:25.444
Actually, we have an example of
an Elf Gram for you here today.

27:25.444 --> 27:28.347
<i>Hey, Sharks, it's me, Tommy,
the Real Elf,</i>

27:28.347 --> 27:33.152
<i>sending you peace, love,
and Elfies all year round.</i>

27:33.152 --> 27:35.754
<i>And remember,
you can do anything,</i>

27:35.754 --> 27:38.157
<i>especially in your red onesie.</i>

27:38.157 --> 27:40.325
<i>Happy holidays!</i>

27:40.325 --> 27:41.994
What does an Elf Gram cost?

27:41.994 --> 27:43.629
$50 per video.

27:43.629 --> 27:45.464
So, it's just you
at the other side,

27:45.464 --> 27:47.566
at the other end
of the tunnel, right?

27:47.566 --> 27:49.902
Correct.
But this past season,

27:49.902 --> 27:52.538
I was pivoting towards
an online model,

27:52.538 --> 27:55.941
because I couldn't be available
to everyone all the time.

27:55.941 --> 27:58.243
Yeah, no kidding.
That's a problem.

27:58.243 --> 27:59.845
It's very seasonal,
obviously.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.647
How much do you make
in one month?

28:01.647 --> 28:06.285
So typically, about $10,000
to $15,000 a month.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.353
This past season was probably
the most successful ‐‐

28:08.353 --> 28:09.521
almost $20,000.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.690
And everything I've made
has been profit.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.226
Year round, as well,
or just around Christmastime?

28:14.226 --> 28:15.627
Just around Christmastime.

28:15.627 --> 28:19.631
But I think the goal here today
is to really expand

28:19.631 --> 28:23.202
the Real Elf brand
by building an online model

28:23.202 --> 28:25.470
so I can make it accessible
to everyone around the world.

28:25.470 --> 28:29.975
So you make $15,000
once a year around the holiday.

28:29.975 --> 28:31.376
Correct.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.678
With your personality,

28:32.678 --> 28:34.713
I'm sure you have
a big online following.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.014
Absolutely.
So tell us about that.

28:36.014 --> 28:39.751
So, everything that I have done
has been online,

28:39.751 --> 28:41.386
so I'm a one‐stop shop.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.122
I don't have a team
of other elves.

28:44.122 --> 28:45.724
You know, I mean, Barbara,
if you're interested,

28:45.724 --> 28:47.059
you're wearing red,
we're wearing red.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.694
I could definitely, like,
hire you if you ‐‐

28:48.694 --> 28:50.829
Barbara, you could be
an elf, too.
How many followers do you have?

28:50.829 --> 28:52.297
Well, probably 10,000

28:52.297 --> 28:55.467
if you include Facebook
and Twitter and Instagram.

28:55.467 --> 28:58.070
I mean, I don't tweet 'cause
I don't have opposable thumbs.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.973
It's very hard to respond
to everyone all the time.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.641
Where did you come up
with the idea of,

29:02.641 --> 29:04.376
"I'm gonna put on
a red onesie

29:04.376 --> 29:06.411
and become a elf?"
Just ‐‐

29:06.411 --> 29:08.747
Well, I have some
wonderful friends that ‐‐

29:08.747 --> 29:10.115
we were at a holiday party.

29:10.115 --> 29:12.985
Everybody started joking
and calling me an elf all night,

29:12.985 --> 29:17.756
and I thought it would be fun
to create a silly holiday card.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.258
And then every year,
everyone was like,

29:19.258 --> 29:21.159
"Are you doing that again?
Are you doing it again?"
Oh.

29:21.159 --> 29:24.796
And I just, you know, I love it.
I enjoy the holidays.

29:24.796 --> 29:26.598
I think you're great
at it, actually.

29:26.598 --> 29:27.933
Yeah, really good.
Yeah, you are.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.368
It's very natural,
and it really works,

29:29.368 --> 29:31.670
and I think it's perfect.
You are the Elf.

29:31.670 --> 29:34.406
Thank you.
You need a social media partner,

29:34.406 --> 29:36.341
'cause you're right,
you can't be everywhere.

29:36.341 --> 29:37.509
Right.

29:37.509 --> 29:38.744
But social media and technology

29:38.744 --> 29:41.146
now could let you build
a brand online.

29:41.146 --> 29:44.349
I wish that person was standing
beside you with a business plan.

29:44.349 --> 29:45.884
But it's a personal
service business.

29:45.884 --> 29:48.186
Every one has to be done
by you, Tommy.

29:48.186 --> 29:49.955
Right. And now it's just
gotten to a point

29:49.955 --> 29:52.824
where I need to expand it
so I can do more.

29:52.824 --> 29:55.594
If you can have
other holiday characters

29:55.594 --> 29:57.996
that you can have exclusively
to this app,

29:57.996 --> 30:00.198
I can be able to expand it more.

30:00.198 --> 30:03.502
But why haven't you done it
to this point, Tommy?

30:03.502 --> 30:06.471
I honestly just don't
have the bandwidth.

30:06.471 --> 30:09.308
You've got 10 months a year
that you're doing nothing!
Is this your full‐time job,
though? Wait.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.376
This isn't my full time ‐‐
What's your regular
full‐time job?

30:11.376 --> 30:14.646
I work for a full‐service
global media agency.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.682
Basically,
I'm an E. A., so ‐‐

30:16.682 --> 30:18.650
E.A. being executive assistant.
Correct.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.586
I know this sounds like
such a bizarre idea.

30:21.586 --> 30:23.588
I honestly think
it's bringing the holidays

30:23.588 --> 30:24.723
into the next generation.
Actually, Tommy,

30:24.723 --> 30:26.758
it doesn't sound like
a bizarre idea at all.

30:26.758 --> 30:28.894
The challenge
is the execution,

30:28.894 --> 30:30.729
because you already have
a full‐time job.

30:30.729 --> 30:31.830
But ‐‐
That's the problem,

30:31.830 --> 30:34.266
and that's why I can't
get my arms around it.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.301
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

30:36.301 --> 30:37.869
I get it. Apps cost
anywhere between ‐‐

30:37.869 --> 30:39.471
Tommy, I think you're terrific,

30:39.471 --> 30:42.307
but I think
this is a deal for Barbara.

30:42.307 --> 30:45.711
So I'm going to step aside.
I'm out.

30:45.711 --> 30:47.846
Tommy, what are you going to do
with the money?

30:47.846 --> 30:51.083
Well, you know, apps cost
anywhere between $60,000

30:51.083 --> 30:52.651
and $300,000

30:52.651 --> 30:54.486
depending on
how complex they are.
Wow.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.888
You really don't need an app.
Yeah, I agree.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.657
I don't think you need
an app at all.

30:58.657 --> 31:01.126
I think you just need to,
like, think of creative,

31:01.126 --> 31:03.995
different, funny ways
in which to do TikToks.

31:03.995 --> 31:07.532
I think you're funny as can be
and so charming.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.568
It's just not
a business to me.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.903
You know, it seems like
a great, fun thing for you

31:11.903 --> 31:13.538
that you can keep growing,

31:13.538 --> 31:16.341
but for those reasons,
I'm out.

31:16.341 --> 31:17.943
Thank you.
Yeah, Tommy.

31:17.943 --> 31:20.512
I love you. I ‐‐
I love you, too.

31:20.512 --> 31:22.080
We just met,
but I love you, too.
I wish we could hang out

31:22.080 --> 31:23.448
and go and have
some drinks, right?

31:23.448 --> 31:24.783
I think this is a great
business for you.

31:24.783 --> 31:26.251
You don't need
a partner for this,

31:26.251 --> 31:28.253
and I think that you can grow it
from $15,000 a year

31:28.253 --> 31:30.222
to $50,000 to $100,000.

31:30.222 --> 31:33.558
You don't realize that you can
figure it out yourself.

31:33.558 --> 31:36.161
So I don't think this is
investable for me. I'm out.

31:37.295 --> 31:39.765
Tommy, there are
four Sharks out,

31:39.765 --> 31:42.000
but all is not lost,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.870
because you're wearing red,
as you said earlier,

31:44.870 --> 31:47.105
and so is Barbara.

31:56.681 --> 31:59.217
Tommy, there are
four Sharks out,

31:59.217 --> 32:01.586
but all is not lost,

32:01.586 --> 32:04.256
because you're wearing red,
as you said earlier,

32:04.256 --> 32:05.624
and so is Barbara.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.559
You could swap.
I look great in
a onesie, by the way.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.728
I really do.
Okay, Barbara,
what are you gonna do?

32:09.728 --> 32:12.130
It does everything, especially
the control‐top pantyhose.

32:12.130 --> 32:14.099
I'm telling you.
Everything's been...

32:15.700 --> 32:17.636
What is most obvious to me
sitting here

32:17.636 --> 32:20.005
is you've got everybody
falling in love with you.

32:20.005 --> 32:21.239
You wear your heart
on your sleeve.

32:21.239 --> 32:22.474
You're so charming,

32:22.474 --> 32:24.075
and that's why I'm sitting here
and I'm interested

32:24.075 --> 32:26.144
'cause I really want to
see you do well.

32:26.144 --> 32:27.779
You lead
with your heart,

32:27.779 --> 32:29.181
and you make the world
a better place.

32:29.181 --> 32:30.415
You're one of those
kind of guys.

32:30.415 --> 32:32.551
We don't have
enough of them out there.

32:32.551 --> 32:35.487
You mentioned working
with a cancer support group.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.022
Why is that
important to you?

32:37.022 --> 32:40.792
So in 2013, I just
had a bit of a rough patch.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.728
So I was diagnosed
with epithelioid sarcoma.

32:43.728 --> 32:45.664
It likes to start at the ends
of your fingers, your toes.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.934
So it's actually missing
my left pinky finger.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.302
Oh, my.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.572
Imerman Angels provides free
one‐on‐one cancer support,

32:53.572 --> 32:56.341
so they were somewhere
that was a source for me,

32:56.341 --> 32:57.609
like, during that time.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.911
Would you be willing to
give away $25

32:59.911 --> 33:01.413
out of every $50?

33:01.413 --> 33:03.415
'Cause I don't think you're
motivated by money at all.

33:03.415 --> 33:04.983
That's my sense of it.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.551
If it would help someone,
absolutely.

33:06.551 --> 33:07.586
Yeah, you would.
Alright.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.154
Well, I'm gonna make you
an offer.

33:09.154 --> 33:12.457
I'm going to give you
the $125,000,

33:12.457 --> 33:17.796
but $50,000 in cash
and $75,000 in loan,

33:17.796 --> 33:20.665
and I'm going to take 35%
of your business.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.300
But I'd like half the sales

33:22.300 --> 33:24.669
to go to a cancer charity
of your choice.

33:26.371 --> 33:27.639
I think that's a good idea,
Tommy,

33:27.639 --> 33:29.274
because they're going to
promote you.

33:29.274 --> 33:32.177
What do you
want to do?

33:32.177 --> 33:33.211
I love you, Barbara.

33:33.211 --> 33:34.746
Ahh.
I love you back.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.114
‐Congratulations.
‐Alright!

33:36.114 --> 33:37.649
‐Yeah!
‐Alright.

33:37.649 --> 33:38.683
You're wonderful.

33:38.683 --> 33:39.751
You're such
a sweetie pie.

33:39.751 --> 33:42.220
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

33:42.220 --> 33:43.822
So darling, really.
Thank you.

33:43.822 --> 33:45.390
And you got
great eyelashes.
And real!

33:45.390 --> 33:47.359
Oh, I know you're real.
That's the problem.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.493
Thank you.

33:49.494 --> 33:50.795
It's just such
a beautiful thing,

33:50.795 --> 33:53.431
and this has just been
preparation meeting opportunity,

33:53.431 --> 33:55.634
so I really thank you so much,
Barbara.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.569
Congratulations, Tommy.
Well done.
Thank you.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.304
Congrats, Tommy.
Thank you.

33:59.304 --> 34:00.305
Congrats.

34:00.305 --> 34:02.307
And he slowly...

34:04.643 --> 34:07.245
See you, Tommy.
Well done.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.383
Happy holidays.

34:11.383 --> 34:14.452
I really thought
that towards the end,

34:14.452 --> 34:16.288
it was a no‐go,

34:16.288 --> 34:21.393
and Barbara just came in,
and it just seems like a,

34:21.393 --> 34:23.628
for lack of a better word,
a Christmas miracle.

34:35.006 --> 34:38.843
Next up is a way to
bring magic to the holidays.

34:49.854 --> 34:51.923
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Chris Cirri.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.258
And I'm Elisa Cirri,

34:53.258 --> 34:55.460
and we're from
Wallingford, Connecticut.

34:55.460 --> 34:58.863
And we are the founders
of Santa's Enchanted Mailbox,

34:58.863 --> 35:02.934
here today seeking an investment
of $150,000

35:02.934 --> 35:07.472
in exchange for 30% equity
in our business.

35:07.472 --> 35:08.940
Writing letters to Santa

35:08.940 --> 35:11.242
is a tradition as old
as Saint Nick himself.

35:11.242 --> 35:13.244
But with the rising cost
of postage,

35:13.244 --> 35:14.879
Santa has chosen our family

35:14.879 --> 35:17.582
to create an exciting
and innovative way

35:17.582 --> 35:19.884
to send your letters
to the North Pole.

35:19.884 --> 35:21.553
With Santa's
Enchanted Mailbox,

35:21.553 --> 35:25.957
children everywhere can now send
their letters, lists, drawings,

35:25.957 --> 35:29.694
and communicate with Santa
and his elves all season long

35:29.694 --> 35:32.797
with real magic happening
right before your eyes.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.533
Allow us to demonstrate
how our product works.

35:35.533 --> 35:39.270
Simply insert
the magical envelope

35:39.270 --> 35:41.606
into Santa's
Enchanted Mailbox.

35:41.606 --> 35:44.643
Close the door.
Raise the flag.

35:44.643 --> 35:48.013
Listen to the enchanted
sounds and chimes.

35:51.049 --> 35:54.486
And when the mailbox
is reopened,

35:54.486 --> 35:56.221
your letter is gone ‐‐
magically!

35:56.221 --> 35:58.623
Oh, serious?
Whisked away to
the North Pole!

35:58.623 --> 36:01.526
But Sharks,
don't just take our word

36:01.526 --> 36:04.462
for how much fun this new
family Christmas tradition is.

36:04.462 --> 36:06.064
Take a look at
some of the excitement

36:06.064 --> 36:07.632
from children
around the world.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.370
<i>Aaah!</i>

36:12.370 --> 36:13.672
<i>What?!</i>

36:17.542 --> 36:20.345
<i>Holy moly!
Aah!</i>

36:22.447 --> 36:24.416
So, Sharks, which one of you

36:24.416 --> 36:26.851
wants a spot
on Santa's nice list?

36:26.851 --> 36:28.286
Come join our family

36:28.286 --> 36:31.556
in spreading Christmas joy
around the world.

36:31.556 --> 36:33.992
How did you even come up
with this idea?

36:33.992 --> 36:35.593
This is a family business.

36:35.593 --> 36:37.729
My wife and I, we've been
married 12 years yesterday.
Yeah.

36:37.729 --> 36:39.898
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.

36:39.898 --> 36:42.967
When our oldest, who's now 10,
was 3 years old,

36:42.967 --> 36:45.637
we used to put out
this cardboard, decorative,

36:45.637 --> 36:47.639
flimsy mailbox
as a decoration.

36:47.639 --> 36:48.907
And we said,
wouldn't it be cool

36:48.907 --> 36:51.042
if we could bring real magic
right in front of him?

36:51.042 --> 36:52.811
Not something left
to the imagination.

36:52.811 --> 36:55.747
So my stepfather‐in‐law
is a retired engineer.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.615
He helped create
the prototype,

36:57.615 --> 37:00.485
then we secured two
granted utility patents.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.020
Good for you.
We trademarked
the name.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.321
And then what, again?

37:03.321 --> 37:05.457
How do we go about
bringing this to the masses?

37:05.457 --> 37:07.158
So we decided to take
a licensing route.

37:07.158 --> 37:09.027
Lisa and I started
writing anybody

37:09.027 --> 37:10.628
that wanted to hear
our story.

37:10.628 --> 37:12.664
I pitched to anybody who
would take a meeting with me

37:12.664 --> 37:14.065
to learn more
about the product,

37:14.065 --> 37:16.701
and we found a wholesale
Christmas‐based company

37:16.701 --> 37:18.837
and signed a three‐year
licensing agreement.

37:18.837 --> 37:21.172
Our licensing agreement
just came to an end.

37:21.172 --> 37:23.975
This is our first year
out on our own, and...

37:23.975 --> 37:25.810
And here we are.
Here we are today.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.078
How much did they sell?

37:27.078 --> 37:30.682
So, our first year,
we did $120,000 in sales.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.650
Our second year,
we were pretty blown away.

37:32.650 --> 37:34.719
A big box retailer
placed an order

37:34.719 --> 37:36.087
for $1.7 million.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.155
Whoo!
Whoa.

37:37.155 --> 37:39.357
And in our third year,
2020,

37:39.357 --> 37:41.459
a lot of obstacles
happened.

37:41.459 --> 37:44.095
On a personal note,
so, my wife owns a hair salon.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.196
Talk a little bit
about that.
Yep.

37:45.196 --> 37:47.665
With COVID,
we were forced to shut down,

37:47.665 --> 37:49.167
and the schools
were forced to shut down.

37:49.167 --> 37:52.203
So overnight, we became
a single‐income family

37:52.203 --> 37:56.040
and so not having my income
pitching in to our home life,

37:56.040 --> 37:59.577
we decided to go a little bit
more conservative on spend,

37:59.577 --> 38:00.879
and that kind of
changed our route

38:00.879 --> 38:03.114
of where we were going
with the mailbox.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.650
Did it sell through
at the big box retailer?

38:05.650 --> 38:08.953
We were told it underperformed
to their expectations.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.989
At the same time,
they dropped the price,

38:10.989 --> 38:12.390
and then they did
start to sell.

38:12.390 --> 38:15.093
How much did you make off
of the licensing agreement?

38:15.093 --> 38:16.294
Like, what percentage?

38:16.294 --> 38:18.530
In our first year,
we did 4%

38:18.530 --> 38:22.100
until we owned the cost
of the mold.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.235
In the second year,
it went up to 6%

38:24.235 --> 38:25.937
and remained at 6%
in our third year.

38:25.937 --> 38:28.173
And did they manufacture this,
or did you?
They did.

38:28.173 --> 38:30.041
So we are actually
currently utilizing

38:30.041 --> 38:31.910
their manufacturer still,

38:31.910 --> 38:33.745
but we're paying a markup
that comes with that.

38:33.745 --> 38:35.780
You're buying direct
to the factory,

38:35.780 --> 38:37.782
but you're going to have
to pay a markup on that?

38:37.782 --> 38:40.351
We're paying a markup to
our former licensing partner

38:40.351 --> 38:42.053
to utilize
the manufacturer.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.255
So you're using
their factory overseas,

38:44.255 --> 38:45.623
but they made you pay
for the molds.

38:45.623 --> 38:46.591
What do the molds cost?

38:46.591 --> 38:47.826
We don't know
the exact total,

38:47.826 --> 38:49.694
but it was close to
$15,000 to $30,000.

38:49.694 --> 38:50.728
We had two
different molds made.

38:50.728 --> 38:51.830
Wow.
Yeah.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.965
This is a lesson
about licensing.

38:53.965 --> 38:55.767
This is a huge lesson.
Are you hearing that,
Kevin?

38:55.767 --> 38:57.535
Well, actually, I wouldn't
have done it that way.

38:57.535 --> 38:59.704
Licensing is okay,
but it's a huge lesson

38:59.704 --> 39:00.972
on the deal that you did.

39:00.972 --> 39:02.340
Yeah.
Right?

39:02.340 --> 39:04.509
This was brand new to us,
and maybe there were some things

39:04.509 --> 39:06.211
that we still scratch
our head about, but...

39:06.211 --> 39:08.413
No, I mean, listen,
don't ever feel bad.
...you live and you learn.

39:08.413 --> 39:12.116
To me, the best lessons
in life are your mistakes.

39:12.116 --> 39:14.686
So let's talk about
the cost of this.
Sure.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.888
How much does it cost to make.
and what do you sell it for?

39:16.888 --> 39:20.191
Right now,
they're at $17.25 all in

39:20.191 --> 39:21.860
to get them here
to the States.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.996
We're selling them
for $49.99 on our website.

39:24.996 --> 39:28.066
We know that we have to drive
down the cost of manufacturing.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.667
You said they brought
the price down,

39:29.667 --> 39:30.635
and it started to perform?

39:30.635 --> 39:31.736
I believe you said that.
Correct?

39:31.736 --> 39:32.971
Correct.
Yeah, exactly.
He did.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.606
And what was
the magic price point

39:34.606 --> 39:35.840
that they started to
perform at?

39:35.840 --> 39:36.975
$29?
$24.99.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.676
‐$24.99?
‐Yeah.

39:38.676 --> 39:40.678
And you're bringing it in
right now at $17.

39:40.678 --> 39:41.679
Correct.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.581
This mailbox is,

39:43.581 --> 39:44.582
it's a decorative
mailbox,

39:44.582 --> 39:45.783
and people
were walking past it.

39:45.783 --> 39:48.786
We had no way to
get the story out,

39:48.786 --> 39:49.988
what it does,

39:49.988 --> 39:51.322
and there was no marketing
budget behind it,

39:51.322 --> 39:53.224
so we're really looking
for strategic partners

39:53.224 --> 39:54.325
that can help
market this.

39:54.325 --> 39:56.427
I don't like seasonality
in retail.

39:56.427 --> 39:59.497
I see this as a challenge
just to go direct‐to‐consumer.

39:59.497 --> 40:01.866
It works. There's magic.
I get it.

40:01.866 --> 40:05.570
But this one's not for me.
I'm out.

40:05.570 --> 40:06.871
Guys, I'm kind of
in the same boat.

40:06.871 --> 40:08.573
I mean, there's a lot
of complexities

40:08.573 --> 40:09.707
for a simple business.

40:09.707 --> 40:12.610
Your relationship
with your former licensee,

40:12.610 --> 40:14.479
your manufacturing
relationship,

40:14.479 --> 40:16.381
particularly trying
to get something done

40:16.381 --> 40:18.549
for this Christmas,
right?
Yeah.

40:18.549 --> 40:21.219
So I mean,
that's just a lot.

40:21.219 --> 40:22.820
That's a big hill
to climb.
Yep.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.422
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.857
Alright.
Thank you, Mark.
Thank you.

40:25.857 --> 40:29.193
I think my challenge is that
you got to get that price down

40:29.193 --> 40:30.528
to put it in retail.
Yep.

40:30.528 --> 40:34.198
And this is a product
that has to be demonstrable,

40:34.198 --> 40:35.333
and it's very hard.

40:35.333 --> 40:36.601
It doesn't have what
we call "hanger appeal,"

40:36.601 --> 40:37.969
'cause you don't even realize

40:37.969 --> 40:40.071
all the great things it does
when you're walking by.

40:40.071 --> 40:43.274
So that means you have to
be converting heavy

40:43.274 --> 40:45.977
on social media
and online.
Yep.

40:45.977 --> 40:48.179
And I don't see it there
just yet,

40:48.179 --> 40:49.714
so I'm out.

40:49.714 --> 40:51.249
Alright, thank you
very much.
Thank you.

40:51.249 --> 40:55.219
I have five seasonal businesses
in the last three or four years,

40:55.219 --> 40:57.355
and what's interesting to me
is those entrepreneurs,

40:57.355 --> 41:00.024
I believe, work harder than
any of my other entrepreneurs,

41:00.024 --> 41:01.926
because I have to push
in a very short window.

41:01.926 --> 41:02.961
Mm‐hmm.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.730
But I think your price
is way too high.

41:05.730 --> 41:07.699
And yet, you're smart people.
You're so dedicated.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.767
I think you ought to find
something else to do.

41:09.767 --> 41:12.070
Okay.
I don't think this thing
is gonna fly.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.271
I'm out.

41:14.605 --> 41:16.274
But wait, but wait.
And then
there was one.

41:16.274 --> 41:18.209
The Queen of Plastic
is still here.
Yep.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.411
We came here today
wanting to walk out of here

41:20.411 --> 41:22.046
with a deal
with the right partner.

41:22.046 --> 41:24.449
I mean, we'd be willing
to move the equity

41:24.449 --> 41:26.884
to where it's beneficial for
the amount of work that we need.

41:26.884 --> 41:28.987
First of all, I think
it's cute as can be.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.121
I really do.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.622
And I think
kids will love it.

41:31.622 --> 41:33.458
It's just spot‐on, to me.

41:33.458 --> 41:35.426
So I think the product
is a hero.

41:35.426 --> 41:39.263
My problem here is
I do think it's too high,

41:39.263 --> 41:41.632
and it sounds like what's
going on with the factory,

41:41.632 --> 41:44.502
that's really difficult once
you don't have control of it.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.970
Yep. Yes.
Very hard.

41:45.970 --> 41:48.773
The other thing that
I worry about with this

41:48.773 --> 41:51.142
is what you could
get that down to.
Yeah.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.444
If you had told me
what this could cost,

41:53.444 --> 41:55.513
what we could do with it,

41:55.513 --> 41:58.049
that would have
turned it for me.
Yeah.

41:58.049 --> 41:59.217
No, I understand.
Yeah.

41:59.217 --> 42:01.252
And so, unfortunately,

42:01.252 --> 42:03.588
because I don't know,
I have to be out.

42:05.623 --> 42:07.959
Well, guys,
thank you so much
Thank you.

42:07.959 --> 42:08.960
for the opportunity
to even be here.

42:08.960 --> 42:09.961
Congrats, guys. Good luck.

42:09.961 --> 42:11.262
‐Thank you.
‐Thank you.

42:13.164 --> 42:14.665
We came into this

42:14.665 --> 42:16.634
very inexperienced
as entrepreneurs.

42:16.634 --> 42:19.037
We're disappointed
that we didn't land the deal,

42:19.037 --> 42:21.205
but we're also grateful
for the opportunity

42:21.205 --> 42:22.206
and the words of wisdom

42:22.206 --> 42:24.675
from five
really successful people.

42:24.675 --> 42:25.910
Yeah,
it was a lot of fun.
