[opening music playing]

00:32.640 --> 00:36.920
[opening music playing]

00:48.760 --> 00:53.960
[atmospheric music]

00:54.040 --> 00:59.320
[atmospheric music]

00:59.400 --> 01:04.160
[atmospheric music]

01:04.320 --> 01:10.960
[footsteps approaching]

01:11.120 --> 01:17.160
[match burns]

01:19.840 --> 01:24.760
[running feet]

01:24.920 --> 01:29.320
[Sister Agatha's footsteps]

01:29.400 --> 01:30.440
[candlestick picked up]

01:30.520 --> 01:32.240
What are you doing?

01:33.600 --> 01:37.520
My duty. The candles must be
lit for night prayers.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.560
[match burns]

01:39.840 --> 01:40.960
[Sister Elena sighs]

01:43.480 --> 01:45.760
[panting]

01:45.920 --> 01:50.640
I believe you will be forgiven for not
attending your duties this day.

01:51.320 --> 01:55.400
I have lit these candles
every day for over thirty years.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.280
[Agatha] This is the tomb of a saint.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.040
We must be saintly in our undertakings.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.080
Tell me again, the story of our martyr.

02:10.720 --> 02:14.160
It’s all here. Her glory surrounds us.

02:15.880 --> 02:21.080
[Agatha] This chapel is where the martyr
Saint Josephine made her last stand.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.720
Cornered by the foul beasts of the abyss

02:24.960 --> 02:27.280
she was weary, and with little hope.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.200
Yet Josephine knew

02:30.280 --> 02:34.440
that if she could not stem
the tide of the creatures then and there

02:34.520 --> 02:37.520
the entire convent would be overrun.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.800
And so in her final moments

02:40.880 --> 02:43.280
as the beasts stole the last of her breath

02:43.680 --> 02:47.160
she called on the Emperor
to guide her hand.

02:47.880 --> 02:51.560
And the Emperor answered her call.

02:51.720 --> 02:54.800
[music crescendos]

02:56.560 --> 02:58.320
[Agatha] In the ages that have followed

02:58.480 --> 03:01.680
she has risen again to protect the convent

03:01.760 --> 03:03.720
in its most dire times of need.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.760
Inhabiting the form of true martyrs

03:10.240 --> 03:11.320
[grunt of pain]

03:11.400 --> 03:15.080
[Agatha] to fight their cause
and smite the enemies of the faith.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.600
And so it shall ever be.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.000
Until she shows herself once more

03:25.080 --> 03:29.080
I will keep the candles burning
to light her way.

03:29.760 --> 03:33.040
And what of you?
When your work here is finished

03:33.320 --> 03:34.720
what shall you do?

03:36.320 --> 03:37.360
Finished?

03:37.520 --> 03:38.560
Hm.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.960
I should like to make
a pilgrimage to Antioth,

03:42.200 --> 03:43.560
the birthplace of our order.

03:47.040 --> 03:50.800
They have great libraries there,
so tall they scrape the sky,

03:50.880 --> 03:52.680
so full of knowledge that it would take

03:52.760 --> 03:55.280
a thousand lifetimes
or more to appreciate.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.080
How do you know? Have you seen them?

03:59.160 --> 04:01.920
No. I always hoped to.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.120
I’ve read of them
in the archives of the convent.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.680
I even spoke to Sister Georgia,
who once made the pilgrimage herself.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.840
[Agatha] And she affirmed the tale?

04:12.760 --> 04:13.760
She said

04:13.840 --> 04:17.720
the sight of those halls
was worthy of even the Emperor’s eyes.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.880
Just the thought of it
brings a tear to my eye, Agatha.

04:22.520 --> 04:25.120
I can almost imagine it...

04:25.200 --> 04:29.720
The time will come.
You shall walk those halls.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.400
How can you know?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.400
I have faith.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.920
[running feet]

04:41.000 --> 04:44.960
[running feet]

04:45.120 --> 04:46.480
[screams]

04:49.360 --> 04:51.640
And you? What shall you do?

04:52.200 --> 04:54.160
I shall see to my duties.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.040
You have given your life to this place.

04:57.120 --> 05:02.160
No, sister.
This place has given me a life.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.120
[distant shouting]

05:05.280 --> 05:06.560
Final duties.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.320
We are in Saint Josephine’s hands now.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.280
She is with us.

05:11.440 --> 05:15.840
[battle cry rising to crescendo]

05:15.920 --> 05:21.080
[battle cry rising to crescendo]

[battle cry rising to crescendo]

Arggggh!

05:48.440 --> 05:50.080
[running feet] [grabs throat]

05:50.240 --> 05:55.480
Khorne demands we look our enemies
in the eye as we cut them down.

05:55.640 --> 05:56.680
[growls]

05:57.440 --> 06:03.440
Argh! Argh!... Argggggh!

06:09.720 --> 06:14.920

-Blood for the Blood God!
-Skulls for the Skull Throne!

06:50.160 --> 06:51.200
Raargh!

06:51.360 --> 06:53.480
For the Emperor and his saints.

06:53.880 --> 06:54.920
[boltgun fires]

06:55.080 --> 06:56.120
[cultist charge]

06:56.280 --> 06:58.360
For the Order and our lost.

07:04.240 --> 07:09.920

Still, your duty?

08:53.960 --> 08:55.480
Still my faith.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.040
[flame crackles]

08:58.840 --> 09:01.720
And so we are blessed
with a moment’s respite.

09:02.640 --> 09:06.320
[reloads gun]

09:06.960 --> 09:10.000
I might yet walk
in the libraries of Antioth, after all.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.080
I believe you shall.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.840
[sword clinks]

09:20.240 --> 09:21.680
[wiping sword]

09:22.800 --> 09:26.440
Soon, our sisters will arrive
to lend us their strength.

09:26.520 --> 09:30.840
Soon, this shrine shall be returned
to peace and solitude.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.440
I am here.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.000
I am with you, Elena.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.640
But now is not your time.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.400
Martyrs...

13:29.000 --> 13:30.560
I see the truth of it.

[atmospheric music]

13:41.200 --> 13:42.600
Rise, sister.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.720
You have one more act of faith to perform.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.040
Saint Josephine is with you.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.840
Be her vessel. Be her wrath.

Argh!

14:23.800 --> 14:25.280
[war cries]

14:25.440 --> 14:29.680
In duty do we find ourselves.

14:30.360 --> 14:33.600
And in faith do we find meaning.

14:34.200 --> 14:37.440
[cultists screaming]

14:37.600 --> 14:41.720
[echoing] For it is we
who deliver the Emperor’s mercy.

14:47.480 --> 14:50.160
And all who oppose him

14:50.760 --> 14:52.800
shall burn.
