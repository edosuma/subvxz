00:01.929 --> 00:03.160
Previously on Angel:

00:03.729 --> 00:06.820
- All those years she spent in that cave.
- She trades one for another.

00:07.330 --> 00:09.330
The visions aren't from The Powers.

00:09.730 --> 00:12.429
A young man's been unfairly imprisoned,
and you're gonna save him.

00:13.330 --> 00:16.660
I do this, and you stop sending
Cordy the killer visions.

00:22.329 --> 00:25.629
- It's just business.
- Don't come at me through Cordy again.

00:25.929 --> 00:29.190
You play that card a second time,
I'll kill you.

00:30.730 --> 00:32.899
- Just trust me.
- I do.

00:33.130 --> 00:36.079
- Don't stiffen up.
- Yeah, you either.

00:36.729 --> 00:39.539
Good defense is about
moving the line of attack.

00:40.329 --> 00:45.420
When the bad guy comes at you, step off
the line like this, creating a new one.

00:46.329 --> 00:49.659
Every time you do, your opponent
will be forced to adjust.

00:49.929 --> 00:53.259
- Move the line, then what?
- Just keep moving the line.

00:54.130 --> 00:57.780
You'll be able to keep an attacker
busy until.... You know.

00:58.929 --> 01:03.500
What? Until he dies of old age,
or until you swoop in to save me?

01:03.729 --> 01:07.349
I didn't ask you to train me so I could
stave. I already know how to stave.

01:08.530 --> 01:11.939
- I need to learn to fight.
- You don't think that I would.

01:12.129 --> 01:14.549
- Would what?
- Save you.

01:15.129 --> 01:18.290
Menfolk not always around
to protect the womenfolk, you know?

01:19.329 --> 01:23.680
Besides, what if you were the guy
I had to fight? It could happen.

01:24.730 --> 01:26.129
Okay.

01:27.129 --> 01:32.049
When you put an adversary down,
make sure he doesn't get up again.

01:33.129 --> 01:36.430
Force the other guy to counter,
and he'll open himself up.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.379
- We'll go half-speed--
- I got it.

01:39.129 --> 01:42.219
Three years of cheer squad, I only ever
had to be shown a move once.

01:42.730 --> 01:45.750
Handling a lethal weapon is a little
different than shaking a pompon.

01:46.329 --> 01:47.590
Ready! Okay!

01:54.129 --> 01:55.459
Go team.

01:55.930 --> 01:58.069
- How long has he been here?
- 20 minutes.

01:58.329 --> 02:01.140
You should have pulled me
out of the meeting. The family?

02:01.329 --> 02:02.489
On their way.

02:05.530 --> 02:08.689
Lilah. I was just keeping
Billy company.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.379
Thanks, Gavin.
I'll take it from here.

02:12.129 --> 02:15.150
Your family has been worried sick.
Where have you been?

02:15.729 --> 02:18.219
- I went for a walk.
- A walk. For three days?

02:18.729 --> 02:23.150
- He was feeling cooped up.
- Why don't you go close an escrow.

02:24.129 --> 02:27.289
You're not supposed to be out
on your own. Remember last time?

02:27.729 --> 02:30.569
You don't wanna end up in that
awful place again, do you?

02:31.330 --> 02:32.840
Of course he doesn't.

02:33.729 --> 02:35.590
No one wants that.

02:36.729 --> 02:37.780
Congressman.

02:37.930 --> 02:41.439
- I trust you've stayed out of trouble.
- No trouble.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.120
Let's go home.

02:45.729 --> 02:51.210
This is the second time you've returned
our nephew safely to us. Thank you.

02:52.330 --> 02:54.430
Our pleasure.

02:55.330 --> 02:59.439
"Our pleasure," in the sense
that he had nothing to do with it.

03:01.930 --> 03:03.120
Nice boy.

03:03.729 --> 03:07.800
He's great. Had his own private
room in hell. Family connections.

03:08.530 --> 03:10.879
Oh, by the way, get out.

03:11.530 --> 03:15.250
- I wasn't finished.
- No. You really were.

03:15.729 --> 03:20.370
You go sniffing around one of my clients
again, I think we'll have a problem.

03:21.129 --> 03:24.009
You think?
Who told you you could think?

03:24.729 --> 03:29.610
Why don't you try listening instead
of flapping that fat mouth of yours?

03:30.729 --> 03:34.699
You weren't captain of the debate team,
were you? At least Lindsey knew--

03:36.000 --> 03:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:40.050 --> 04:42.579
It's inspiring to see you like this.

04:43.649 --> 04:47.899
Training with Angel, taking
responsibility. I'm proud of you.

04:49.050 --> 04:51.120
Never hurts to be prepared.

04:51.449 --> 04:53.589
We should all be battle-ready.

04:54.449 --> 04:57.500
Dead! So very, very dead.
Just how dead are you?

04:58.050 --> 04:59.980
I'm tired of being the dead one.

05:00.449 --> 05:03.959
I was thinking I'd enter into a similar
training arrangement with Fred.

05:04.649 --> 05:08.480
If you think she can help
you fight, why not?

05:09.449 --> 05:11.269
I'm kidding.

05:12.449 --> 05:16.629
Wesley, if you want
to get to know Fred better...

05:17.850 --> 05:20.730
...maybe the next time you have her
over for dinner...

05:20.850 --> 05:22.709
...you won't ask the rest of us
to come along.

05:23.250 --> 05:27.779
I mean....
Was I that obvious?

05:28.649 --> 05:29.769
Yeah! Yes!

05:30.449 --> 05:33.680
I don't think anybody else noticed.

05:35.250 --> 05:38.300
She's a rather
extraordinary young woman.

05:38.850 --> 05:43.839
Still, the last thing any of us should
be doing is coupling with each other.

05:44.850 --> 05:46.740
Office romances,
even under normal circumstances--

05:47.250 --> 05:50.199
We don't live
in normal circumstances.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.660
What are the odds of any of us
finding someone...

05:53.850 --> 05:56.550
...who can deal with the stuff
that we have to deal with?

05:57.449 --> 06:00.779
- I don't know, maybe we are meant--
- For each other?

06:01.050 --> 06:05.259
Actually, I was gonna say, to be alone.
But what the heck.

06:06.449 --> 06:11.959
Wesley, if you like her, tell her.
Just go right up to her and...

06:13.050 --> 06:15.079
...hack her into little pieces.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.199
Easy. Okay. Up.

06:24.449 --> 06:27.079
Convenience store.
Man attacking a woman.

06:28.050 --> 06:31.490
- His wife. It's his wife.
- How many stores on the West Side?

06:32.250 --> 06:35.160
Even if you just include Santa Monica,
Beverly Hills and Malibu...

06:35.850 --> 06:40.129
...the combined population is 130,000,
spread over 30 square miles--

06:40.649 --> 06:42.649
- A lot.
- I was getting there.

06:43.050 --> 06:47.230
- Two teams. Gunn, you and I--
- No, it's too late.

06:48.449 --> 06:52.800
You can't save her.
This murder happened a week ago.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.560
Why would they show this to me now?

07:00.410 --> 07:03.389
- What's this?
- Everything you saw in your vision.

07:04.009 --> 07:06.750
Police reports,
husband's written confession...

07:07.610 --> 07:11.230
...captures from the store's cameras
and, I caution you...

07:11.810 --> 07:14.790
...the medical examiner's
crime-scene photos. Cordelia....

07:15.410 --> 07:16.639
You shouldn't be looking at that.

07:17.209 --> 07:20.930
Tell that to The Powers.
They ran the THX version in my head.

07:21.410 --> 07:25.480
- How did you get this stuff?
- The old-fashioned way. I bought it.

07:26.209 --> 07:29.759
- The police sold you this stuff?
- Not exactly. Someone who has access.

07:30.410 --> 07:34.310
Usually they sell to the tabloids
when the victims are high-profile.

07:35.209 --> 07:36.959
- Charlene Baird.
- The victim.

07:37.610 --> 07:40.560
She and the perpetrator were married for
30 years. No previous domestic violence.

07:40.610 --> 07:43.069
- Why'd he do it?
- He says she wouldn't listen to him.

07:43.610 --> 07:47.750
- He was trying to make her stop talking.
- Well, it worked.

07:49.009 --> 07:53.579
This guy confessed. Crime solved.
Why are The Powers airing reruns?

07:53.810 --> 07:56.439
- I don't know.
- I do.

07:58.009 --> 08:03.069
11:24, 20 minutes before
the crime occurred, look who's there.

08:12.410 --> 08:14.660
- Oh, boy.
- What?

08:14.810 --> 08:16.319
What?

08:19.610 --> 08:23.959
Okay, kind of cute.
So who is he?

08:33.409 --> 08:35.870
You're sure this is him?
This is the guy?

08:36.409 --> 08:40.269
You pull someone from a hell dimension,
you tend to remember their face.

08:41.210 --> 08:43.460
Yeah, that's him.

08:47.809 --> 08:49.669
Well, then.

08:54.409 --> 08:59.149
Now we know why The Powers made me
experience that woman's death.

09:01.009 --> 09:03.080
She died because of me.

09:03.409 --> 09:04.879
- No.
- Yes.

09:05.210 --> 09:08.190
Angel, if he's somehow responsible,
then so am I.

09:08.809 --> 09:11.059
You didn't break him out and put him
back on the streets. I did.

09:11.809 --> 09:16.059
- For me. You did it to save me.
- And I'd do it again.

09:17.809 --> 09:19.070
- Angel....
- Hey.

09:23.210 --> 09:28.480
Whatever's happening now,
you're not responsible for this...

09:29.809 --> 09:32.159
...and neither am I.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.629
But I know who is.

09:43.009 --> 09:46.029
Dramatic entrance. Except for
the part where you can't enter.

09:46.610 --> 09:49.070
- You're a little jumpy, Lilah.
- Long day at the office.

09:49.610 --> 09:52.799
And you know your boy's on the loose.
You know what he's doing.

09:53.210 --> 09:55.529
It's been brought to my attention.

09:58.009 --> 10:01.059
- God, are you--?
- I'm fine. You should see the other guy.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.820
I plan to.

10:04.009 --> 10:07.200
- Billy never touched me.
- I know, he has some power that makes--

10:08.210 --> 10:11.860
Billy never touched me, and
you can't touch him. Nobody can.

10:12.409 --> 10:15.779
Billy, as in Blim, as in
Congressman Nathan Blim's nephew.

10:16.009 --> 10:18.919
That family's the closest thing
this country has to royalty.

10:19.610 --> 10:23.120
They own half the eastern seaboard.
The law won't go near them.

10:23.809 --> 10:26.200
- I'm not the law.
- This isn't some beast you can just--

10:27.409 --> 10:30.669
- Why are you protecting him?
- I'm sorry. This deep concern...

10:31.009 --> 10:33.009
...coming from the only man I know...

10:33.409 --> 10:36.179
...who definitely wants to kill me
is a bit much on a day like this.

10:37.009 --> 10:40.269
- Your hands are shaking.
- Stay away from my client.

10:56.570 --> 11:00.009
- This is it. The Blim estate.
- Not very welcoming, is it?

11:01.370 --> 11:03.789
I don't suppose it'd do much good
to ring the bell either.

11:04.370 --> 11:07.629
How about we sneak in dressed
as security guards or something?

11:07.970 --> 11:11.480
Well, it's a possibility.
Or we could--

11:16.370 --> 11:19.879
So you wanna go next?

11:21.169 --> 11:23.519
- I guess we wait here.
- Yeah.

12:00.769 --> 12:04.769
Why doesn't it surprise me that
I can walk in without an invitation?

12:04.970 --> 12:06.830
As far as I'm concerned,
you have a standing invitation.

12:07.370 --> 12:10.320
You're not a right guy.
You're not quite human either, are you?

12:10.970 --> 12:12.549
Not quite. More than you.

12:12.769 --> 12:15.720
You like to hurt women.
That make you feel like a man?

12:16.370 --> 12:19.779
I've never hurt a woman in my life.
I just like to watch.

12:20.570 --> 12:21.870
- Not anymore.
- Oh?

12:22.370 --> 12:23.419
- You're going back.
- Really?

12:23.570 --> 12:26.799
- I don't think so.
- L.A. Police Department!

12:28.370 --> 12:32.409
Hands where we can
see them. Turn around. Slowly.

12:33.769 --> 12:36.159
- You're looking for me.
- William Blim?

12:36.769 --> 12:40.559
That's right. I'm the one that
called you. Did you find the body?

12:41.570 --> 12:45.889
- We're taking you in for questioning.
- Oh, yes. I should think you would.

12:46.370 --> 12:48.789
Sanchez, read him his rights.

12:50.570 --> 12:55.240
Will those be necessary? I won't
give you trouble. I'll come quietly.

13:03.769 --> 13:07.100
- Who are you?
- He's nobody.

13:07.970 --> 13:09.860
You have the right
to remain silent....

13:15.769 --> 13:19.460
- I told you to take Pico.
- Relax, Sanchez. We'll get there.

13:19.970 --> 13:23.480
Did you just tell me to relax?
You think you can talk to me like that?

13:24.169 --> 13:27.929
I'd talk to you with my finger,
but I like both hands on the wheel.

13:28.970 --> 13:29.879
- Pull over.
- What?

13:30.169 --> 13:31.360
- Pull over!
- What's your problem?

13:31.370 --> 13:34.919
I'll tell you what my problem is,
I got a woman here that don't listen.

13:45.250 --> 13:48.899
My contact at the morgue confirms it,
a body was discovered earlier tonight.

13:49.450 --> 13:52.220
A young woman was reported missing
three days ago. Someone phoned in.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.330
- Billy.
- Makes no sense. Even if he did it...

13:55.450 --> 13:58.289
...he didn't do it. Why confess?
What does it get him?

13:59.049 --> 14:00.490
Gets him out.

14:00.850 --> 14:04.470
Out of his $12 million compound
and into a cell at Men's Central.

14:05.049 --> 14:07.649
- Yes, but for how long?
- An impenetrable cube of hellfire...

14:08.649 --> 14:10.860
...in a demon dimension
couldn't do much, so...

14:11.049 --> 14:13.679
...my guess, regular bars,
not really a problem.

14:14.649 --> 14:17.250
She's right. All he'll need
to get out is his lawyer.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.139
- What're you doing?
- Get there before Lilah does.

14:20.649 --> 14:23.070
- And then what?
- I'll take him out of the cell.

14:23.649 --> 14:27.129
Wait. You can't barge into a police
precinct and go all Terminator,

14:27.850 --> 14:29.600
- I'll be okay.
- It's dangerous. He's dangerous.

14:30.250 --> 14:33.019
- What if he lays his whammy on you?
- He won't be conscious.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.480
He's not there.

14:35.049 --> 14:38.950
I just heard it on the police scanner.
The patrol car never made it back.

14:39.850 --> 14:41.669
There's been an accident.

14:51.850 --> 14:55.220
There was an altercation. One
of the officers attacked his partner.

14:55.450 --> 14:58.289
She was forced to shoot him.
The female's been taken to the hospital.

14:59.049 --> 15:02.240
Maybe she can tell us what Billy did
to her partner before he snapped.

15:02.649 --> 15:05.840
Wouldn't be a bad idea if one of us was
standing by at the hospital.

15:06.850 --> 15:09.379
Maybe start a conversation
with the staff or one of her buddies?

15:09.850 --> 15:12.169
- Maybe.
- I'm on it.

15:16.450 --> 15:19.470
The blood in that car,
some of it is his.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.190
Not human.

15:32.049 --> 15:34.149
He came through here.

15:34.450 --> 15:36.909
And recently. It's still wet.

15:37.450 --> 15:40.779
I'll take a sample and see
what sort of creature Billy is.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.090
- I can't wait for that.
- I understand.

15:43.450 --> 15:45.200
- I can find him.
- Be careful.

16:03.850 --> 16:06.059
What you doing?

16:06.250 --> 16:08.669
I'm gonna go run an errand.

16:09.850 --> 16:11.879
A normal, everyday errand.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.240
Cordelia.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.519
I don't think you should do this.

16:19.450 --> 16:21.730
How can I not?

16:29.049 --> 16:32.490
Fred, you're here. Good.
I was hoping you would assist me.

16:34.450 --> 16:37.399
I managed to lift
a sample of Billy's blood.

16:37.450 --> 16:41.980
Maybe we can identify his demon lineage
and figure out how his power works.

16:42.850 --> 16:45.759
Would you hand me the...

16:47.049 --> 16:48.909
...glass slides?

16:50.049 --> 16:51.870
Thank you.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.539
- Cordelia Chase? Come to gloat?
- I can do that anywhere.

17:02.649 --> 17:06.410
Are you gonna invite me in?
Oh, wait. I'm not a vampire.

17:08.049 --> 17:10.579
Please, come on in.

17:11.650 --> 17:15.759
I want you to tell me about Billy.
Everything you didn't tell Angel.

17:17.049 --> 17:18.380
Help me stop him.

17:18.848 --> 17:21.240
What makes you think
I'm gonna do that?

17:21.848 --> 17:24.660
Well, there's your face,
for starters.

17:25.450 --> 17:29.730
- I accept the risks of my job.
- Why were you crying five minutes ago?

17:30.250 --> 17:33.799
There's not a thing about badly
reapplied mascara I don't know.

17:36.250 --> 17:39.730
I'm not Lindsey McDonald. I don't
switch sides whenever it gets tough.

17:40.450 --> 17:43.400
And since when is this your job?
I thought Angel was the dark revenger.

17:44.049 --> 17:47.309
Angel feels responsible for this guy
because he brought him back from hell.

17:48.250 --> 17:51.619
I feel responsible
because he did it to save me.

17:51.849 --> 17:53.990
You, who are actually
responsible for the entire thing...

17:54.849 --> 17:57.829
...feel nothing at all,
because you are a vicious bitch.

17:58.450 --> 18:02.170
- So you know me.
- Please. I was you. With better shoes.

18:02.650 --> 18:04.509
- These are Baracci.
- Fall collection?

18:05.049 --> 18:06.630
- Next spring.
- He's widened the heel.

18:07.450 --> 18:09.170
- And rounded the toe.
- Won't work with pink.

18:09.250 --> 18:12.410
- Pink is out this spring.
- Billy Blim makes people crazy.

18:12.849 --> 18:14.920
Not all people. Just men.

18:15.849 --> 18:20.029
He brings out a primordial misogyny
in them. Turns them into killers.

18:20.650 --> 18:22.859
Then why didn't he do it to Angel?

18:23.650 --> 18:27.759
- Angel's seen him?
- Yes. Right before he escaped.

18:30.250 --> 18:33.230
- What's so witty?
- Billy's touch works differently...

18:33.849 --> 18:36.450
...on different men.
Some lose their mind in an instant.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.900
Others can take hours.

18:40.450 --> 18:43.220
Gee, I sure hope Angel
isn't starting to feel testy.

18:43.450 --> 18:46.009
- You better hope it.
- I know. I've seen his dark side.

18:47.049 --> 18:49.369
You really haven't.

18:50.049 --> 18:51.839
I have to find Billy.

18:53.650 --> 18:56.420
And I'm gonna help you, why?

18:56.650 --> 18:59.210
You know that guy you hired
to hack into my visions?

18:59.650 --> 19:03.440
What he did to me,
you know what it felt like?

19:05.049 --> 19:09.190
I was cut, torn up, my face
disfigured and burning with pain...

19:09.849 --> 19:13.990
...not knowing if it would end
or just get worse till I died.

19:15.849 --> 19:19.220
- So you think I owe you--?
- It's not the pain.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.309
It's the helplessness.

19:21.849 --> 19:25.220
The certainty that there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

19:26.049 --> 19:29.740
That your life can be thrown away
in an instant by someone else.

19:30.250 --> 19:33.410
He doesn't care.
He'll beat you down...

19:33.849 --> 19:36.900
...because he doesn't
even think of you as alive.

19:37.450 --> 19:39.980
No woman should ever
have to go through that.

19:41.049 --> 19:44.809
And no woman strong enough
to wear the mantle of "vicious bitch"...

19:45.250 --> 19:47.569
...would ever put up with it.

19:50.650 --> 19:54.019
Where is Billy going?

19:58.769 --> 20:00.730
He seemed like a level-headed guy.

20:01.170 --> 20:03.519
Always polite.
"Yes, sir. " "Thank you, sir. "

20:04.170 --> 20:06.660
To lose it like that....
I didn't see it coming.

20:07.170 --> 20:11.349
Hacking 14 years, I understand
why he did it. There's a point, right?

20:11.970 --> 20:14.920
How many times you feel like
taking a fist to a customer?

20:15.569 --> 20:20.069
- One of your drivers snapped?
- Yeah, he beat the hell out of a fare.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.859
- A woman?
- That surprise you?

20:23.369 --> 20:27.759
Probably sitting in the back telling
him how to drive. You know the type.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.819
Yeah. Probably had it coming to her.

20:32.369 --> 20:34.089
I'm just saying....

20:34.170 --> 20:38.210
Get out of here. You're gonna tell me
what this driver's last stop was...

20:38.970 --> 20:42.450
...right before he beat up
that woman. "I'm just saying. "

20:59.049 --> 21:02.279
- Dylan, your cousin's here.
- Which one? There's a zillion.

21:02.650 --> 21:08.339
- I think he said his name's Billy.
- Billy? Not possible. Billy's....

21:11.049 --> 21:12.420
Hi, Dylan.

21:14.650 --> 21:15.809
Billy.

21:17.049 --> 21:19.150
I didn't know
you were having a party.

21:19.450 --> 21:25.180
We agreed that you weren't gonna come
here anymore after that last thing.

21:26.650 --> 21:30.720
Somebody should talk to them
about appropriate public behavior.

21:31.450 --> 21:34.930
Do you want to, or should I?

21:42.250 --> 21:47.170
This was taken from the print I made of
Billy's blood. Tell me what you think.

21:48.250 --> 21:53.059
Looks to me as if some of the red
blood cells are supercharged.

21:54.250 --> 21:57.549
Those would probably
be from Billy's demon lineage.

21:58.450 --> 22:02.980
So however Billy's putting the mojo
on people, the power's in his blood.

22:03.849 --> 22:08.839
Which means it could also be in his
sweat, his saliva or even his touch.

22:10.450 --> 22:13.470
Speaking of saliva,
where is Cordelia?

22:14.049 --> 22:17.029
What do you mean,
"speaking of saliva"?

22:17.650 --> 22:20.809
It's a simple question.
Where is Cordelia?

22:23.049 --> 22:25.789
- I think she went out.
- Out?

22:27.849 --> 22:31.890
- Did she happen to mention where?
- She said an errand.

22:35.650 --> 22:38.460
When you say you "think she went out"
you mean you know she went out...

22:39.250 --> 22:41.250
...because you spoke to her.

22:41.650 --> 22:43.609
- Well, I suppose that--
- Suppose?

22:44.049 --> 22:47.839
- I did. Yes, I did.
- That's better.

22:51.250 --> 22:53.740
Lie to me again...

22:54.250 --> 22:57.200
...and we're going to have a problem.

23:08.049 --> 23:10.650
- Where are you going?
- I was gonna call Cordelia...

23:11.049 --> 23:14.240
- ...find out where she is for you.
- That's not necessary.

23:14.650 --> 23:16.019
- It's not?
- No.

23:17.650 --> 23:19.539
Sit down, Fred.

23:20.049 --> 23:22.890
- It'll just--
- Sit down.

23:30.250 --> 23:32.460
There's something
we need to discuss.

23:32.650 --> 23:35.279
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
Cordelia left. Really, I am.

23:35.650 --> 23:38.319
We're past that.
I put it behind me.

23:39.250 --> 23:42.619
However, we will have to make
some changes around here.

23:43.450 --> 23:47.559
- Change can be good, I guess.
- No more of these provocative outfits.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.970
Provocative?

23:50.049 --> 23:54.119
Maybe Mommy and Daddy never
explained to you that men, grown men...

23:54.849 --> 23:57.730
...are wired a certain way.

24:00.849 --> 24:04.259
You can't come in here, day after day,
waving it in my face like this.

24:05.049 --> 24:08.279
- What?
- You're practically daring me to take it.

24:08.650 --> 24:09.519
Is that what you want?

24:09.849 --> 24:12.200
- Stop it.
- Oh, are we standing now?

24:12.849 --> 24:16.890
- This is making me uncomfortable.
- You're uncomfortable? That's rich.

24:17.650 --> 24:21.759
What do you think it's like for me
with you smelling the way you do?

24:22.450 --> 24:24.940
- Wesley, please.
- You think you can taunt a man?

24:25.450 --> 24:27.549
You brush up close,
bat your eyes...

24:27.849 --> 24:30.730
...and when our backs are turned,
you laugh at us.

24:31.450 --> 24:32.819
- I'd never--
- Humiliate us.

24:33.849 --> 24:37.849
You think you can do anything
you please because you bleed?

24:38.049 --> 24:39.380
No.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.990
I'll show you blood.

24:50.049 --> 24:53.309
What do you tell a woman
who has two black eyes?

24:55.450 --> 24:58.539
Nothing you haven't already
told her twice.

25:00.849 --> 25:02.740
No sense of humor.

25:20.049 --> 25:22.650
- I'm looking for Billy Blim.
- You a friend of his?

25:23.049 --> 25:26.529
Friend? To be honest,
I'm looking to kill the bastard.

25:27.250 --> 25:30.200
Come on in.

25:33.849 --> 25:36.450
- Is he here?
- No. He came and went.

25:36.849 --> 25:41.349
And everybody's okay? I was expecting
blood, carnage, bad things.

25:42.250 --> 25:45.369
You gotta know the rules around Billy.
Everybody in the family does.

25:45.849 --> 25:49.680
Never leave him alone with your girl
and don't let him touch you.

25:50.650 --> 25:54.059
- He wants money, leave it on a table.
- Is that why he was here?

25:54.849 --> 25:57.589
Said he needed fun money.
I just wanted to get rid of him.

25:57.849 --> 25:59.849
Can you explain something to me?

26:00.250 --> 26:03.299
How come you invited me in after I
told you I wanted to kill your cousin?

26:03.849 --> 26:05.779
You're Angel, right?

26:06.250 --> 26:09.900
- Billy mention me?
- No. There was a chick here. Cute.

26:11.049 --> 26:14.420
She said a melodramatic guy named
Angel would eventually show up.

26:14.650 --> 26:19.640
- Cordelia. Thinks I'm melodramatic?
- You did say you'd kill my cousin.

26:20.650 --> 26:22.930
That's not melodrama--
She was here?

26:23.650 --> 26:27.339
- Melodrama is exaggerated--
- This is real. Where'd you send her?

26:27.849 --> 26:31.640
Santa Monica. The family plane is there.
Billy said he wants to fly someplace.

26:32.650 --> 26:35.140
He didn't say where.
Hopefully far away.

26:36.769 --> 26:38.240
Fred?

26:42.170 --> 26:43.890
Fred.

26:45.170 --> 26:47.660
I know what you're doing.

26:48.170 --> 26:50.380
What you're up to.

26:51.769 --> 26:53.730
Luring me.

26:54.170 --> 26:57.009
Forcing me to find you.

26:59.569 --> 27:02.549
It's such a dog-and-pony show.

27:04.369 --> 27:07.779
You beguile me
with your girlish ways.

27:10.970 --> 27:13.460
I pursue you.

27:15.170 --> 27:17.490
But you never give over, do you?

27:18.170 --> 27:21.890
No, you just keep
laughing and running.

27:25.369 --> 27:30.250
Well, guess what, my love,
I'm not some downy-faced schoolboy.

27:37.369 --> 27:39.690
I'm a man.

27:45.170 --> 27:48.680
You can't come out into the open,
can you?

27:52.369 --> 27:54.859
No, you hide.

27:55.369 --> 27:57.440
You deceive.

28:00.170 --> 28:04.809
It's nothing new.
It goes all the way back to Eve.

28:06.769 --> 28:10.740
You and the serpent,
plotting behind our backs.

28:13.369 --> 28:17.160
"Here, honey, eat this.
It's just an apple."

28:21.170 --> 28:24.400
That's the problem with your sex.

28:25.369 --> 28:29.200
You're all weak and you're all dirty,
and you won't be satisfied...

28:30.170 --> 28:34.099
...until you've brought every one
of us down into the muck with you!

28:56.569 --> 28:59.170
Why do you make me do this?

29:27.690 --> 29:29.440
Billy.

29:30.089 --> 29:32.339
Yes? Do I know you?

29:33.690 --> 29:37.829
Not exactly.
I thought we should meet.

29:39.690 --> 29:43.759
I'm the woman Wolfram and Hart
tortured to get you out of your cell.

29:44.490 --> 29:45.609
Oh, I see.

29:48.089 --> 29:51.000
And you're here to whine.
Poor, helpless, battered woman...

29:51.690 --> 29:55.130
...needs to vent her feelings
about the injustice of it all.

29:55.890 --> 29:57.539
No, ass-wipe.

30:00.690 --> 30:03.180
I'm here to send you back.

30:10.890 --> 30:13.279
I'm still here.

30:15.089 --> 30:18.529
I don't run away like a girl.
I see things through.

30:56.490 --> 30:59.789
You think I hate you because
you're a woman. I don't.

31:00.089 --> 31:03.640
- And I was feeling special.
- I don't hate women.

31:04.289 --> 31:07.130
Sure, you're all whores, who sell
yourselves for money or prestige...

31:07.890 --> 31:10.769
...but men are just as bad.
Maybe even worse.

31:11.490 --> 31:14.400
They're willing to throw away
careers, families, lives...

31:15.089 --> 31:17.089
...for what's under your skirt.

31:17.490 --> 31:19.279
I'm wearing pants.

31:19.890 --> 31:23.299
So you can dress and talk like a man....
Does that make you feel superior?

31:23.490 --> 31:27.769
I'm feeling superior because I have
an arrow pointed at your jugular.

31:28.890 --> 31:33.000
And the irony of using a phallic-shaped
weapon.... Not lost on me.

31:34.289 --> 31:37.130
You don't have the nerve to do it.

31:37.890 --> 31:40.210
Wrong again.

31:43.289 --> 31:46.980
- I can't let you do it, Cordelia.
- You saved me again. I knew you would.

31:47.490 --> 31:50.789
- You know what he is.
- Which is why I'll waste him myself.

31:51.690 --> 31:54.430
Angel. He can't hurt me.

31:54.690 --> 31:56.579
No, I won't hurt her.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.789
I won't hurt her at all.

32:14.650 --> 32:16.509
In here.

32:22.450 --> 32:24.839
- What happened to Wesley?
- Somehow he got infected.

32:25.450 --> 32:29.099
I figure it happened while he was working
with Billy's blood from that handprint.

32:29.650 --> 32:33.369
That finger-painty-looking handprint
downstairs is Billy's blood?

32:34.450 --> 32:37.819
Wes turned into a psycho killer
because of that bloody handprint...

32:38.049 --> 32:40.079
...that I picked up and looked at?

32:41.049 --> 32:43.509
When you put it that way,
it worries me.

32:45.250 --> 32:48.440
I better get out of here.
Lock the door behind me.

32:53.650 --> 32:55.720
Or maybe we'll go to plan B.

33:01.450 --> 33:02.640
Oh, God.

33:04.450 --> 33:07.430
You said you'd go to plan B,
but what's plan B?

33:08.049 --> 33:10.400
Plan B.... Plan B....

33:12.849 --> 33:14.289
Charles?

33:14.650 --> 33:18.619
Plan B is the one where, if you don't
stop whining, I bash in your--

33:20.049 --> 33:21.279
Oh, God.

33:26.049 --> 33:27.490
Cordy, get out of here.

33:27.849 --> 33:29.460
- No.
- Cordelia.

33:29.650 --> 33:31.789
- I can't.
- Get out!

33:32.650 --> 33:37.670
- You can fight this.
- Don't fight it, feel it.

33:38.650 --> 33:41.910
You can, can't you? All that rage
and hatred bubbling to the surface.

33:42.849 --> 33:46.009
I've never done this to a vampire.
Should be entertaining.

33:46.450 --> 33:48.519
Please, go.

33:49.450 --> 33:51.980
I can't.
I have this problem.

33:52.450 --> 33:56.420
This is happening to you
because of me. Because of me.

33:57.250 --> 34:01.819
So I can't leave you, Angel. I won't.

34:03.849 --> 34:06.549
You think that's your problem?

34:08.650 --> 34:13.039
That's not your problem.
You know what your real problem is?

34:14.050 --> 34:16.079
Guys like him!

34:17.650 --> 34:20.039
'Cause you got no power over me.

34:26.650 --> 34:28.260
You're scaring me.

34:28.449 --> 34:30.909
Take this and knock me out.
Knock me out!

34:31.449 --> 34:33.909
- You want me to hit you?
- Yes!

34:34.449 --> 34:36.619
- I can't.
- You might want to.

34:38.650 --> 34:39.880
Hit me!

34:39.849 --> 34:42.409
- Charles, please.
- "Charles, please." Fine.

34:42.849 --> 34:44.780
Give it back to me so I can
smash your stupid head with it.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.920
- What?
- Give me the damn chair leg!

34:52.449 --> 34:54.869
You're gonna pay for that.

36:19.449 --> 36:22.219
Would you like to hear
my theory, Fred?

36:22.449 --> 36:25.400
It's about how stupid you are.

36:27.250 --> 36:29.570
I believe that after five years
of living in a cave...

36:30.250 --> 36:33.480
...you'll instinctively retreat
to small, dark places...

36:33.849 --> 36:36.380
...rather than run outside,
where you'd be safe.

36:47.650 --> 36:49.610
Let's finish this.

36:53.050 --> 36:55.539
I'm sorry, Wesley.

36:56.650 --> 36:58.679
You're sorry?

36:59.050 --> 37:03.019
You were right about me
liking dark places to hide in.

37:05.650 --> 37:09.130
But you forgot
I also like to build things.

37:23.250 --> 37:25.210
I don't get it.

37:25.650 --> 37:27.900
I don't get it either.

37:28.650 --> 37:30.510
I mean, you're a man...

37:30.449 --> 37:34.309
...so why didn't
Billy's touch affect you?

37:35.250 --> 37:38.829
Maybe because I'm not human.

37:39.449 --> 37:43.909
Oh, right. And a vampire can never
be turned into a monster.

37:45.449 --> 37:49.659
Well, that thing that Billy
brought out in others?

37:50.250 --> 37:55.590
That hatred and anger....
That's something I lost a long time ago.

37:56.250 --> 37:58.110
Even when you were evil?

37:58.650 --> 38:01.739
I never hated my victims.
I never killed out of anger.

38:02.250 --> 38:06.820
It was always about the pain
and the pleasure.

38:07.650 --> 38:08.949
Huh.

38:09.449 --> 38:14.050
I guess you could say your demon-ness
makes you less petty than humans.

38:14.849 --> 38:16.639
Almost noble.

38:17.250 --> 38:22.340
I mean, in a twisted, dark
and really disturbing kind of way.

38:25.050 --> 38:26.699
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

38:31.650 --> 38:33.119
It's weird.

38:33.449 --> 38:34.989
What is?

38:35.250 --> 38:37.780
I'm getting used to being
creeped out...

38:38.250 --> 38:41.130
...and comforted at the same time.

38:41.849 --> 38:43.849
I get that.

38:59.250 --> 39:00.860
Wesley?

39:01.650 --> 39:04.670
Wesley, it's me, Fred.

39:24.449 --> 39:27.469
Does that hurt?

39:31.050 --> 39:32.840
Sorry.

39:43.050 --> 39:45.539
I left a bunch of messages.

39:46.050 --> 39:51.139
Yes. I meant to call you back.
I'm sorry.

39:53.849 --> 39:56.130
I'm so sorry.

39:58.050 --> 40:01.670
Wesley, you gotta come back to work.

40:04.050 --> 40:06.960
- How can I?
- What do you mean?

40:07.050 --> 40:11.329
How can you not? You're the boss.
We need you.

40:12.449 --> 40:16.769
You took a few days off.
That's good. We all did.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.789
- But now it's time to come back.
- Fred.

40:22.650 --> 40:25.110
- I tried to kill you.
- That wasn't you.

40:25.650 --> 40:30.000
How can you know that? Something
inside me was forced to the surface.

40:31.050 --> 40:33.440
- Something primal.
- Do you wanna kill me?

40:33.449 --> 40:34.989
God, no.

40:35.849 --> 40:38.239
It wasn't something in you, Wesley.

40:38.250 --> 40:41.409
It was something
that was done to you.

40:42.449 --> 40:44.409
I don't know what kind of man
I am anymore.

40:44.849 --> 40:48.010
Well, I do.

40:50.250 --> 40:52.000
You're a good man.

40:57.449 --> 41:00.469
Will I see you back at the office?

41:04.050 --> 41:05.349
Yeah.

41:07.050 --> 41:08.590
Good.
