WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.836
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...
(grunting) I'm Faith.

00:03.871 --> 00:06.139
I'm gonna go out on a limb and
say there's a new slayer in
town.

00:06.174 --> 00:07.641
BUFFY:
Faith, no!
 You don't get it.

00:07.674 --> 00:08.976
You killed a man.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.477
No, you don't get it.

00:10.510 --> 00:11.811
I don't care.

00:11.845 --> 00:12.913
She's unstable, Buffy.

00:12.945 --> 00:15.682
(grunts)

00:15.715 --> 00:18.719
You sent your boy
to kill me. He's dust.

00:18.751 --> 00:21.054
Guess that means
 you have a job opening.

00:21.088 --> 00:24.358
How'd you like to get your hands
on the Books of Ascension?

00:24.391 --> 00:25.092
You got the books?

00:25.126 --> 00:25.759
(grunts)

00:27.295 --> 00:28.596
What's this ascension mean?

00:28.629 --> 00:29.663
Mayor Wilkins is over

00:29.696 --> 00:30.731
100 years old.

00:30.763 --> 00:31.998
He's not human.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.301
Nothing can harm me
until the ascension.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.308
(grunts)

00:42.409 --> 00:44.344
(grunting)

00:44.378 --> 00:46.179
GILES:
 We have a rogue slayer
 on our hands.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.780
I can't think
of anything more dangerous.

00:47.814 --> 00:50.783
There's a word for people
like you, Faith. "Loser."

00:50.817 --> 00:53.420
No one can stop the ascension.
Mayor's got it wired, B.

00:53.454 --> 00:54.854
He built this
town for demons

00:54.887 --> 00:56.590
to feed on,
and come graduation day,

00:56.624 --> 00:57.957
he's gettin' paid.

00:57.990 --> 00:59.960
Stick around.

01:01.661 --> 01:04.998
WILKINS:
All right, you can
open them up now.

01:06.799 --> 01:09.870
Fab. What's the occasion?

01:09.903 --> 01:13.106
Faith, as if I need a reason
to show you my affection.

01:13.141 --> 01:16.109
Or appreciation for running
a small errand at the airport.

01:16.144 --> 01:19.280
Airport? What's next?

01:19.313 --> 01:21.882
You gonna want me to help
a buddy of yours move a sofa?

01:21.914 --> 01:23.884
This isn't a free ride,
young lady.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.718
You know, I'm beginning to think

01:25.753 --> 01:27.721
that somebody's getting
a little spoiled.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.222
Maybe I should take this back.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.224
Sorry.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.293
Sir.

01:33.326 --> 01:34.962
That's my girl.
(chuckles)

01:34.995 --> 01:36.629
Another cookie?

01:37.865 --> 01:39.167
Now,

01:39.200 --> 01:42.002
a package is arriving
tomorrow night

01:42.034 --> 01:43.570
from Central America.
Something--

01:43.603 --> 01:45.104
and I can't stress this enough--

01:45.139 --> 01:47.174
something crucially
important to my ascension.

01:47.207 --> 01:49.277
Without it...

01:49.310 --> 01:50.743
Well, what would

01:50.777 --> 01:53.281
Tollhouse Cookies be
without the chocolate chips?

01:53.313 --> 01:55.448
A pretty darn big
disappointment,

01:55.483 --> 01:57.450
I can tell you.
(chuckles)

01:57.484 --> 01:58.951
Open your present.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.663
There.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.500
That look on your face
is my reward.

02:12.532 --> 02:15.134
This is a thing of beauty, boss.

02:15.169 --> 02:16.503
Well, it cost a pretty penny.

02:16.537 --> 02:19.639
So, you
just take

02:19.673 --> 02:21.808
good care of it.

02:21.841 --> 02:23.711
You be careful not to
put somebody's eye out

02:23.743 --> 02:25.646
with that thing.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.216
Until I tell you to.

02:28.248 --> 02:31.651
Got any particular
eyes in mind?

02:31.685 --> 02:33.152
(growls)
(grunting)

02:39.526 --> 02:40.561
Sorry, honey.

02:40.593 --> 02:42.329
That's okay.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.399
(snarling)

02:47.033 --> 02:48.701
(grunting)

02:53.706 --> 02:57.344
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

02:57.377 --> 02:58.746
Unless, of course, you're me.

02:58.778 --> 03:00.580
That was bracing.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.849
Want to do another sweep?
It's what

03:02.883 --> 03:05.151
I live for. Sad to say.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.487
You too tired?
No.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.223
It's just...

03:10.258 --> 03:12.393
Do you get the feeling
that we're...

03:12.425 --> 03:13.993
kind of in a rut?

03:14.026 --> 03:16.396
A rut?

03:16.430 --> 03:18.532
You never take me anyplace new.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.802
What about that fire demon nest
in the cave by the beach?

03:25.038 --> 03:27.941
Thought that was
a nice change of pace.
So this is

03:27.974 --> 03:31.110
our future? I mean, this is how
we're gonna spend our nights

03:31.144 --> 03:33.546
when I'm 50 and you're...

03:33.581 --> 03:34.747
the same age

03:34.781 --> 03:36.917
you are now?

03:36.949 --> 03:39.353
(growling)
Let's just get you to 50.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.754
Liking that plan.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.860
(wolf howling)

03:47.895 --> 03:49.962
*

04:42.949 --> 04:45.653
Buffy?

04:45.685 --> 04:47.654
When were you
gonna tell me?

04:47.687 --> 04:49.122
All right.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.959
Busted. I-I didn't think
you'd miss them.

04:51.992 --> 04:55.862
You were accepted to
Northwestern University?

04:55.896 --> 05:00.100
Honey, I'm so proud of you.
That's wonderful.

05:00.132 --> 05:02.168
Right. It's wonderful.
Mmm.

05:02.201 --> 05:04.103
I mean, it's not cheap,

05:04.137 --> 05:06.105
but, uh, I know we can
make it work if your father

05:06.139 --> 05:07.540
pitches in.

05:07.574 --> 05:10.543
Not that Northwestern
is your only option.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.545
(chuckles)
It's a great school though.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.981
I am so proud of you.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.350
You said that before.

05:17.384 --> 05:18.886
And will again soon.

05:18.918 --> 05:20.252
Mom, you know that I can't...

05:21.321 --> 05:23.122
I-I just can't decide

05:23.156 --> 05:24.957
on a school right now. I mean,

05:24.992 --> 05:27.860
I-I want to sleep on it,
you know, mull it over.

05:27.894 --> 05:30.163
Raise them up my inner flagpole,
see which one I salute.

05:30.197 --> 05:32.165
I know, sweetheart.

05:32.199 --> 05:35.302
I'm just so pleased
that you have so many choices.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.036
Ooh.

05:37.069 --> 05:40.673
You know what? Your Aunt Arlene
and her family are in Illinois.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.442
I've got to call and tell them.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.380
Oh, Buffy...

05:47.415 --> 05:49.316
I know. You're proud of me.

05:49.348 --> 05:51.317
Uh, don't forget to put
my earrings back in my dresser

05:51.350 --> 05:53.586
before you go out.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.189
A-Arlene?

05:57.223 --> 05:58.759
Hi. It's Joyce.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.192
How you doin'?

06:00.226 --> 06:01.595
Listen,
you are never gonna believe

06:01.629 --> 06:03.997
where Buffy got accepted
to school.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.565
(indistinct chatter)

06:05.598 --> 06:07.401
Here you go.
Thanks.

06:07.435 --> 06:10.504
Okay, what's in the bag?
My lunch.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.406
Is that the new drug lingo?

06:12.439 --> 06:14.040
No. It's my lunch.

06:20.247 --> 06:21.581
Sit up straight.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.353
Sounds like your mom's
in a state of denial.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.021
More like a continent.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.759
She just has to realize
that I can't go away.

06:31.792 --> 06:35.062
Well, maybe not now
but soon, maybe.

06:35.095 --> 06:38.298
Or maybe I, too,
hail from Denial Land.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.300
Faith's turn to the
dark side of the Force

06:40.332 --> 06:43.903
pretty much put the proverbial
kibosh on any away plans for me.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.038
UC Sunnydale. At least I got in.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.240
You-- I mean, I can't
believe you got into Oxford.

06:48.274 --> 06:49.610
It's pretty exciting.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.644
There's some deep
academia there.

06:51.678 --> 06:52.980
That's where they make Gileses.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.983
I know. I could learn
and-and have scones.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.985
Although I don't know how I feel
about going to school

06:59.019 --> 07:01.788
in a foreign country.
XANDER:
"Everything in life

07:01.822 --> 07:03.055
is foreign territory."

07:03.089 --> 07:04.625
Kerouac,

07:04.658 --> 07:06.392
he's my teacher.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.995
The open road, my school.

07:09.028 --> 07:10.997
Making the open
Dumpster your cafeteria?

07:11.031 --> 07:12.632
Go ahead, mock me.

07:12.665 --> 07:13.834
I think she just did.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.769
We bohemian,
antiestablishment types

07:15.802 --> 07:17.269
have always been persecuted.

07:17.303 --> 07:18.672
Well, sure. You're
all so weird.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.273
I think it's neat,

07:20.307 --> 07:23.410
you doing the backpack,
trail mix, happy wanderer thing.

07:23.442 --> 07:25.077
I'm aware it scores kind of high

07:25.112 --> 07:26.480
on the hokey meter.
But I think it'll be good

07:26.514 --> 07:28.314
for me, you know,
help me to find myself.

07:28.348 --> 07:31.418
And help us to lose you.
Everyone's a winner.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.922
Well, look who just popped open
a fresh can of venom.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.456
Hey, did you hear about Willow

07:36.490 --> 07:39.125
getting into Oxnard?
And M.I.T.
Oxford.

07:39.158 --> 07:41.194
and Yale and every other college
on the face of the planet,

07:41.228 --> 07:43.262
as in your face I rub it.

07:43.295 --> 07:45.665
Oxford. Whoopee.

07:45.699 --> 07:48.435
Four years in tea bag central.
Sounds thrilling.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.504
And M.I.T.
is a Clearasil ad

07:50.538 --> 07:51.771
with housing.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.340
And Yale is a dumping ground

07:53.372 --> 07:54.942
for those
who didn't get into Harvard.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.308
I got into Harvard.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.377
Any clue on what college
you might be attending,

07:58.411 --> 08:00.713
so we can start calculating
minimum safe distance?

08:00.747 --> 08:02.014
None of your business.

08:02.048 --> 08:04.151
Certainly nowhere near
you losers.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.553
You guys, don't forget
to breathe between insults.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.555
I'm sorry, Buffy.
This conversation is reserved

08:08.588 --> 08:12.324
for those
who actually have a future.

08:12.358 --> 08:14.795
OZ:
That is

08:14.827 --> 08:16.028
an angry young woman.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.865
Oh, Buffy, she was
just being Cordelia.

08:17.898 --> 08:21.634
Only more so. Don't pay
any attention to her.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.903
XANDER:
She's definitely
got a chip goin'.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.737
Maybe if you didn't
goad her so much.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.406
I can't help it.
It's my nature.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.841
Maybe you need
a better nature.

08:30.509 --> 08:32.144
I don't understand.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.880
Well, I don't think
I can talk any slower, Wes.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.883
I want to leave.
What, now?

08:35.914 --> 08:40.253
No, not now. After
I graduate. College?

08:40.287 --> 08:42.389
But... you're a slayer.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.758
Yeah. I'm also a person.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.092
You can't
just define me

08:46.125 --> 08:48.427
by my slayerness. That's...

08:48.461 --> 08:50.163
something-ism.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.932
Buffy, I know we've talked
about you going away.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.735
I got into Northwestern.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.238
That's wonderful news.
Good for you.

08:58.270 --> 09:02.075
All right, everyone. Monsters,
demons, world in peril.

09:02.109 --> 09:05.211
I'll bet you they have
all that stuff in Illinois.
You cannot

09:05.245 --> 09:06.714
leave Sunnydale.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.615
With the power invested in me
by the council,

09:08.649 --> 09:10.783
I forbid it.

09:10.817 --> 09:12.785
(sighs)

09:12.820 --> 09:14.621
Oh, yes, that
should settle it.

09:14.654 --> 09:16.956
With Faith gone bad
and the mayor's

09:16.990 --> 09:19.626
ascension
coming up...
I know it's complicated.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.128
I'm aware that
my graduation

09:21.161 --> 09:23.395
may be, among other things,
posthumous,

09:23.429 --> 09:26.399
but what if I stop
the ascension?

09:26.432 --> 09:28.235
What if I capture Faith?
I very much
hope you will.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.070
If I do that,
then all you guys have to do

09:30.102 --> 09:32.105
is keep the run-of-the-mill
unholy forces at bay

09:32.139 --> 09:33.373
through midterms,
and I'll be back

09:33.405 --> 09:34.707
in time for
homecoming

09:34.741 --> 09:36.744
and every school break
after that.

09:38.577 --> 09:40.947
Can we at least think about it?

09:40.980 --> 09:43.616
Perhaps if circumstances
were different...
I'll make them different.

09:43.650 --> 09:47.386
What?
I'm tired of waiting for Mayor
McSleaze to make his move

09:47.419 --> 09:49.756
while we sit on our hands,
counting down to Ascension Day.

09:49.789 --> 09:51.591
Let's take the
fight to him.
No.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.592
No!

09:53.626 --> 09:55.162
Much too reckless.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.096
We're
at a distinct disadvantage.

09:57.129 --> 09:58.731
We don't know anything
about the mayor's ascension.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.301
She's right. Time's running out.

10:01.333 --> 10:02.970
We need to take the offensive.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.604
What's your plan?

10:05.673 --> 10:08.475
I got to have a plan? Really?

10:08.508 --> 10:11.110
I can't just be proactive
with pep?

10:11.144 --> 10:14.114
You want to take the fight to
them, I suggest the first step

10:14.147 --> 10:16.182
would be to find out
exactly what they're up to.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.184
Oh. I actually knew that.

10:18.217 --> 10:19.852
I thought you meant
a more specific plan,

10:19.886 --> 10:21.754
you know,
like with maps and stuff.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.024
Great. We'll find out
what they're up to.

10:25.357 --> 10:27.727
(whirring)

10:54.254 --> 10:56.355
*

11:02.495 --> 11:04.297
Is he in the car?

11:04.331 --> 11:05.565
No, I'll take you to him.

11:09.235 --> 11:13.039
The mayor was supposed to be
here, in person, with the money.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.576
Well, the price just went up.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.712
I don't like surprises.

11:19.746 --> 11:21.280
(groans)

11:24.517 --> 11:26.619
(clatter, thud)

11:28.620 --> 11:31.024
Surprise.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.676
You killed him.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.078
What are you, the narrator?
Get the keys to the cuffs.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.919
(sighs)
Nothin'.

12:00.953 --> 12:03.923
(bow clatters)

12:03.956 --> 12:05.524
(chuckles)
That won't

12:05.557 --> 12:06.927
cut through steel.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.496
No, but it'll cut through bone.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.140
*

12:49.802 --> 12:52.205
*

12:56.609 --> 13:00.413
Hey-ho! There it is!
(laughs)

13:00.447 --> 13:02.414
Uh, what happened
to the courier?

13:02.448 --> 13:04.250
I was supposed
to pay him.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.019
Huh. I made him an offer
he couldn't survive.

13:07.053 --> 13:10.023
(laughs)

13:10.057 --> 13:12.625
You are one heck of a girl,

13:12.658 --> 13:14.427
you know that?
I mean, geez,

13:14.461 --> 13:16.663
the initiative, the-the skill.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.431
Go on. Go on.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.167
I will.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.034
You know, I'll tell you,
if Buffy S... Hey, hey,

13:22.068 --> 13:24.971
hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey. If Buffy Summers

13:25.004 --> 13:26.338
walked in here
and said she wanted

13:26.373 --> 13:28.107
to switch to our side, I'd say,

13:28.140 --> 13:29.775
"No, thanks, sister.
I got all the slayer

13:29.808 --> 13:32.144
one man could ever need."
(chuckles)

13:32.178 --> 13:33.712
(sighs)

13:33.745 --> 13:35.148
What?

13:35.182 --> 13:36.649
Nothing.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.051
Oh.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.552
It's 'cause I used
the B-word, huh?

13:40.586 --> 13:41.989
Don't tell me you're still
sore about that whole

13:42.022 --> 13:44.390
Angel-Buffy thing.

13:44.423 --> 13:47.894
No, I'm over it.
She can have him.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.696
Better believe
she can.

13:49.729 --> 13:53.299
She deserves that poor excuse
for a creature of the night.

13:53.332 --> 13:56.602
You, on the other
hand, can do better.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.707
Don't do that.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.710
(brakes squeak)

14:03.743 --> 14:06.145
(parking brake clicks)

14:06.178 --> 14:07.679
(engine shuts off)

14:07.714 --> 14:09.716
(sighs)

14:10.716 --> 14:13.052
(clattering)

14:17.190 --> 14:19.826
(grunting)

14:19.859 --> 14:22.095
So,

14:22.129 --> 14:23.696
what's in the box?

14:23.730 --> 14:25.264
The Box of Gavrock. It houses

14:25.298 --> 14:27.033
some great demonic energy
or something

14:27.067 --> 14:29.536
which His Honor needs
to chow down on come A-Day.

14:29.568 --> 14:31.770
What's
that?

14:31.803 --> 14:33.539
Maps and stuff.

14:33.572 --> 14:35.207
Plans for City Hall.

14:35.241 --> 14:36.943
They were in the Water
and Power mainframe.

14:36.976 --> 14:38.544
The box is being
kept under guard

14:38.577 --> 14:40.846
in a conference room
on the top floor.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.682
There.
Unfortunately,

14:42.715 --> 14:44.183
that's all I could get out
of my informant

14:44.216 --> 14:45.851
before his aggressive tendencies
forced me

14:45.884 --> 14:47.787
to introduce him
to Mr. Pointy.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.722
Well, now, here's what
I think we should do...
I figure

14:50.756 --> 14:52.792
we can enter
through the skylight.
I'll take Angel with me.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.628
Agreed.
There's a fire ladder on the
east side of the building, here.

14:55.662 --> 14:56.696
WESLEY:
Yes. Yes, fine.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.298
But we still
need to consider

14:58.331 --> 14:59.566
whether the...
It won't be enough

14:59.599 --> 15:01.467
to simply have possession
of the box.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.802
Right.
We have to destroy it.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.236
Not just physically, ritually.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.306
With some down-and-dirty
black magic.

15:06.339 --> 15:09.642
Hang on. We don't know what
such a ritual would require.
I think

15:09.676 --> 15:11.644
the Breath of the Entropics
is standard

15:11.677 --> 15:13.645
for this sort of thing.
Fairly simple recipe.

15:13.679 --> 15:15.615
Xander.
I know.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.085
I'm ingredient-gettin' guy.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.751
All right, stop!

15:19.786 --> 15:23.322
I demand everyone
stop this instant.

15:23.355 --> 15:25.993
I'm in charge here,

15:26.025 --> 15:28.227
and I say this is all
moving much too fast.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.062
We need time
to fully analyze

15:30.096 --> 15:31.563
the situation
and devise

15:31.597 --> 15:34.000
a proper
and strategic stratagem.
Wes,

15:34.033 --> 15:36.168
hop on the train or
get off the tracks.

15:36.202 --> 15:39.005
The mayor will most assuredly
have supernatural safeguards

15:39.038 --> 15:41.540
protecting the box.

15:42.975 --> 15:45.912
Oh, we all forgot
about that, did we?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.179
Looks like a job
for Wiccan girl.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.182
What do you say, Will?
Big-time danger.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.584
Hey, I eat danger
for breakfast.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.586
But, oddly enough, she panics
in the face of breakfast foods.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.788
Let's get to work.

16:02.695 --> 16:05.065
(indistinct chatter)

16:19.979 --> 16:21.713
(bell tinkles)

16:21.748 --> 16:24.384
(door shuts)
I have a theory.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.653
Your snide remarks
earlier?

16:26.686 --> 16:29.822
I'm guessing grapes
a little on the sour side.

16:29.855 --> 16:31.990
Didn't get
into any schools, did ya?

16:32.024 --> 16:33.725
The grades were there,
but, ooh,

16:33.759 --> 16:35.562
if it weren't
for that pesky interview.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.164
Ten minutes with you, and the
admissions department decided

16:38.197 --> 16:40.167
that they'd already reached
their mean-spirited,

16:40.200 --> 16:42.000
superficial princess quotas.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.571
And once again, the gold medal

16:44.604 --> 16:46.206
in the Being Wrong event

16:46.239 --> 16:49.509
goes to Xander "I'm
As Stupid As I Look" Harris.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.379
Read 'em and weep, creep.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.515
USC, Colorado State,

16:56.548 --> 16:59.918
Duke, and
Columbia.

16:59.951 --> 17:02.922
Wow. These are, uh,

17:02.955 --> 17:04.757
great colleges.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.259
I'm guessing

17:06.291 --> 17:07.858
they must have seen
a different side

17:07.894 --> 17:09.194
of your father's money.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.265
Go away.
Sure.

17:12.298 --> 17:13.932
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go back

17:13.964 --> 17:16.169
to helping to save some lives.
Carry on.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.838
I know that you have some
important accessorizing to do.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.508
(bell tinkles)
(door opens)

17:21.540 --> 17:23.643
(door shuts)

17:24.711 --> 17:27.079
(tires screech)

17:33.885 --> 17:36.355
Now, remember,

17:36.388 --> 17:38.191
if anything should go awry,

17:38.224 --> 17:40.026
Wesley and I will create
a diversion.

17:40.058 --> 17:42.028
Let's synchronize
our watches.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.131
I have 21:4...

17:44.163 --> 17:47.733
(sighs)
Yes, typical.
Maybe we could

17:47.767 --> 17:49.701
just count.
One 1,000, two 1,000...

17:49.736 --> 17:51.837
Be careful, all of you.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.508
Tea?

18:11.089 --> 18:13.460
You got the goods?
Yeah.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.127
Essence
of toad.

18:15.162 --> 18:18.565
Twice-blessed sage.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.268
Maybe that's the toad.
Well,

18:21.300 --> 18:22.835
we better be sure.
Destroying this box

18:22.868 --> 18:25.070
is supposed to be
a pretty delicate operation.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.574
Well, then they shouldn't
leave it in the hands
of the lay people.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.576
Well, Will laid it out
for us pretty well.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.512
Wow, she even drew
helpful diagrams.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.115
That's the pedestal.
Mm-hmm. And the ingredients.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.785
And us. See, there's
you, there's me.

18:38.817 --> 18:40.452
Well, how can you tell
which is which?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.788
I mean, they both kind of
look stick-figurey to me.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.957
Well, this one's me.
See the little guitar?

18:44.990 --> 18:47.294
Oh, gotcha.
Yeah.

18:47.326 --> 18:48.961
Nobody like my Will.

18:48.994 --> 18:51.063
No, sir, there is not.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.969
Okay... toad me.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.075
*

19:24.096 --> 19:25.731
Thanks.

19:34.707 --> 19:39.412
Sis modo dissolutum.

19:41.180 --> 19:45.484
Exposco validum scutum.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.921
Diutius nec defende

19:48.954 --> 19:52.291
a manibus arcam intende.

19:57.195 --> 19:59.531
Oh, yeah. I'm bad.

19:59.566 --> 20:00.767
Four stars, Will.

20:00.799 --> 20:02.902
Now get gone.

20:02.934 --> 20:04.202
I'm gone.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.934
Got it!
(alarm ringing)

20:37.503 --> 20:40.539
Oh. Angel?

20:40.573 --> 20:41.973
It's jammed.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.310
I'd like very much
to come up now, please.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.045
(footsteps running)

20:46.077 --> 20:47.212
Angel!

20:47.246 --> 20:48.847
I know.

20:49.682 --> 20:50.982
(growling)

20:51.017 --> 20:52.884
Don't suppose you want
to help me get down.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.086
(snarling)

20:54.119 --> 20:55.488
Didn't think so.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.990
(snarls)

21:00.259 --> 21:01.493
Ah!

21:03.296 --> 21:04.364
Ooh!

21:07.534 --> 21:09.301
(grunts)

21:10.369 --> 21:11.703
(growls)

21:25.617 --> 21:26.818
(snarling)

21:36.496 --> 21:39.798
(grunting)

21:45.304 --> 21:46.038
(snarls)

21:54.012 --> 21:55.382
(glass shattering)

21:55.414 --> 21:58.484
(vampires snarling)

22:00.519 --> 22:01.753
(growls)

22:13.265 --> 22:15.267
(tires screeching)

22:18.104 --> 22:19.372
(laughter)

22:36.955 --> 22:41.861
Well... this is
very unfortunate.

22:41.894 --> 22:45.765
I just had this conference room
redecorated, for Pete's sake.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.767
At taxpayers' expense.

22:47.799 --> 22:50.036
And oh, yeah... gah!

22:53.072 --> 22:54.941
They've got my box.

22:54.973 --> 22:56.342
FAITH:
Yeah, they do.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.778
But looky what we got.

23:03.315 --> 23:04.983
(chuckles)

23:09.655 --> 23:11.624
How did you guys let this...

23:11.657 --> 23:13.759
How did this happen?

23:13.792 --> 23:16.194
We thought
she stayed with you.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.930
They must have grabbed her
when she hit the ground.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.397
Buffy, I'm sorry.

23:19.432 --> 23:21.800
Look, it's nobody's
fault, okay?

23:21.834 --> 23:24.202
We just need to focus
and deal.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.605
Oz, I swear I won't
let them hurt her.

23:26.638 --> 23:29.741
We go back.
Full-on assault.

23:29.776 --> 23:32.278
They'll kill her.
We're assuming
they haven't already?

23:32.310 --> 23:35.080
No. No, they know
what she means to us.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.316
She's too valuable
as long as we still have...

23:37.348 --> 23:39.384
the box.

23:39.417 --> 23:42.421
We trade.
We can't.

23:42.454 --> 23:44.457
No, it's the safest plan.
It's the only way. Right?

23:44.490 --> 23:46.459
It might well be.

23:46.492 --> 23:49.761
Look, we call the mayor
and arrange a meeting.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.096
This box must be destroyed.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.664
I need a volunteer
to hit Wesley.

23:52.699 --> 23:54.299
Giles, you know
I'm right about this.

23:54.333 --> 23:56.301
Wes, you want to
duck and cover
at this point?

23:56.335 --> 23:58.336
Damn it, you listen to me!

23:58.369 --> 24:00.906
This box is the key
to the mayor's ascension.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.409
Thousands of lives depend upon
our getting rid of it.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.810
Now, I want to help Willow

24:04.844 --> 24:06.613
as much as
the rest of you,

24:06.645 --> 24:08.681
but we will find another way.

24:08.714 --> 24:10.616
There is no other way.

24:10.650 --> 24:11.851
You're the one who said

24:11.884 --> 24:13.352
take the fight to the mayor.

24:13.384 --> 24:14.353
You were right.

24:14.385 --> 24:15.855
This is the town's

24:15.887 --> 24:17.123
best hope of survival.

24:17.155 --> 24:19.858
It's your chance to get out.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.760
You think I care about that?

24:21.794 --> 24:23.328
Are you made of human parts?

24:23.362 --> 24:25.431
All right! Let's deal
with this rationally.

24:25.463 --> 24:26.932
Are you taking
his side?

24:26.965 --> 24:28.934
(all shouting at once)

24:28.968 --> 24:30.803
Don't be ridiculous!
Listen to you people.

24:30.836 --> 24:33.640
You'd sacrifice
thousands of lives?

24:33.673 --> 24:35.307
Your families?
Your friends?

24:35.340 --> 24:37.977
It can all end
right here.

24:38.009 --> 24:39.345
We have the means
to destroy this box....

24:48.487 --> 24:50.355
Giles, make
the phone call.

24:53.491 --> 24:55.662
*

24:55.694 --> 24:57.697
(window rattling)

25:02.433 --> 25:04.836
(grunting)

25:20.086 --> 25:21.554
What are you doing?

25:21.587 --> 25:23.154
Um...

25:23.189 --> 25:25.324
I'm looking for
a sucking candy,

25:25.356 --> 25:27.926
'cause my mouth gets dry
when I'm-I'm nervous

25:27.960 --> 25:29.361
or held prisoner

25:29.394 --> 25:31.396
against my will.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.098
And suddenly I'm thinking

25:33.132 --> 25:34.532
"sucking" isn't
a good word to use

25:34.567 --> 25:35.902
around vampires.

25:35.934 --> 25:37.368
Hey!

25:37.403 --> 25:38.738
Did you get permission
to eat the hostage?

25:38.770 --> 25:40.439
I don't think so.

25:40.471 --> 25:42.709
You're gonna be in some trouble
when the mayor gets...

25:42.741 --> 25:44.210
(growling)
No!

25:45.243 --> 25:47.046
Just a little taste.

25:47.078 --> 25:48.314
(snarling)

26:06.732 --> 26:08.667
(door rattling)

26:17.509 --> 26:18.911
FAITH:
They're not gonna be
brain-damaged enough

26:18.944 --> 26:20.145
to come back here tonight.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.413
WILKINS:
Ever have a dog?

26:22.448 --> 26:24.549
What?
I did.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.785
Rusty.

26:25.817 --> 26:27.053
Irish Setter.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.621
Swell little pooch.

26:28.654 --> 26:30.923
A dog's friendship
is stronger than reason,

26:30.957 --> 26:32.157
stronger than its own sense

26:32.191 --> 26:33.826
of self-preservation.

26:33.859 --> 26:35.326
Buffy's like a dog.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.429
And hey, before you can say
"Jack Robinson,"

26:37.462 --> 26:39.498
you'll get to see me
kill her like one.

26:44.502 --> 26:46.471
*

27:16.201 --> 27:18.704
Whoa.

27:29.580 --> 27:30.849
(clicks)

27:35.354 --> 27:38.523
The Books of Ascension.

27:45.897 --> 27:47.900
*

27:59.377 --> 28:01.012
FAITH:
Check out the bookworm.

28:01.047 --> 28:02.280
Faith.

28:04.951 --> 28:07.019
Anybody with brains,

28:07.053 --> 28:10.021
anybody who knew
what was going to
happen to her,

28:10.056 --> 28:12.858
would be trying
to claw her way out
of this place.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.526
But you...

28:14.559 --> 28:16.863
you just can't stop
Nancy Drewing, can you?

28:19.530 --> 28:21.599
I guess now
you know too much,

28:21.633 --> 28:24.403
and that kind of just
naturally leads to killing.

28:24.435 --> 28:27.705
Faith, wait!
I want to talk to you.

28:27.740 --> 28:30.209
Oh, yeah. Give me
the speech again, please.

28:30.241 --> 28:31.609
"Faith, we're still
your friends.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.578
We can help you.
It's not too late."

28:33.612 --> 28:36.281
It's way too late.

28:36.315 --> 28:39.585
You know, it didn't
have to be this way.

28:39.617 --> 28:42.520
But you made your choice.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.423
I know you had a tough life.

28:44.455 --> 28:45.691
I know that some people think

28:45.723 --> 28:47.926
you had a lot
of bad breaks.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.560
Well, boo-hoo!

28:49.595 --> 28:51.197
Poor you.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.564
You know, you had

28:52.597 --> 28:54.232
a lot more
in your life

28:54.266 --> 28:56.102
than-than some people.

28:56.134 --> 28:58.703
I mean, you had friends
like Buffy.

28:58.737 --> 28:59.939
Now you have no one.

28:59.971 --> 29:01.539
You were a slayer,

29:01.573 --> 29:03.642
a-and now you're nothing.

29:03.674 --> 29:05.576
You're just a big, selfish,

29:05.611 --> 29:06.678
worthless waste.

29:09.015 --> 29:11.416
You hurt me,
I hurt you.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.251
I'm just a little
more efficient.

29:14.653 --> 29:16.587
Oh, and here I just thought

29:16.622 --> 29:18.089
you didn't have a comeback.

29:18.124 --> 29:21.126
You're begging
for some deep pain.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.394
(breathing hard)

29:22.428 --> 29:23.962
I'm not afraid of you.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.299
Let's see what we can do
about that.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.435
WILKINS:
Girls...

29:30.469 --> 29:32.637
I hope I don't have
to separate you two.

29:32.671 --> 29:34.506
Faith, you can play with
your new toy later.

29:34.539 --> 29:36.107
Something's come up.

29:37.809 --> 29:40.511
Faith.

29:40.546 --> 29:41.948
You know I don't like
repeating myself.

29:44.182 --> 29:45.984
I got someone.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.286
I got him.

29:49.855 --> 29:51.289
(sighs)

29:51.323 --> 29:52.691
I just received

29:52.723 --> 29:55.027
a heck of an
interesting phone call.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.865
*

30:06.204 --> 30:08.473
(rattling)

30:11.542 --> 30:13.011
The whole place
is locked down,

30:13.045 --> 30:14.613
except for the front.

30:14.645 --> 30:17.215
Yeah, it gives me
that comforting
"trapped" feeling.

30:17.249 --> 30:20.719
One way out
means one way in.

30:20.751 --> 30:23.221
I want to see 'em
coming.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.857
I guess they're shy.

30:27.492 --> 30:28.894
I can see all right.

30:48.413 --> 30:49.815
Well, this is
exciting, isn't it?

30:49.847 --> 30:51.217
(laughs)

30:51.250 --> 30:53.852
Clandestine meetings
by dark of night,

30:53.885 --> 30:55.221
exchange of prisoners.

30:55.253 --> 30:56.688
I just... I...

30:56.721 --> 30:58.324
(laughs)

30:58.356 --> 30:59.892
I feel like we should
all be wearing trench coats.

30:59.925 --> 31:01.692
Let her go.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.263
No.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.532
Not until the box
is in my hands.

31:07.566 --> 31:10.036
So you're
the little girl

31:10.068 --> 31:12.471
that's been causing me
all this trouble.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.575
She's pretty, Angel.

31:18.076 --> 31:20.679
A little skinny.
Still don't understand

31:20.711 --> 31:22.780
why it couldn't work out
with you and my Faith.

31:24.482 --> 31:26.884
Guess you kind of just
have strange taste in women.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.586
Yeah, well, what can I say?

31:28.619 --> 31:29.855
I like 'em sane.

31:29.887 --> 31:31.022
(grunts)

31:31.057 --> 31:32.723
Angel...

31:35.260 --> 31:37.262
Well, I wish you kids
the best, I really do,

31:37.296 --> 31:39.464
but, uh, if you
don't mind a bit
of fatherly advice,

31:39.498 --> 31:41.567
I, uh...
I-I just don't see

31:41.599 --> 31:43.769
much of a future for you two.

31:43.801 --> 31:46.438
I don't sense
a lasting relationship.

31:46.471 --> 31:48.539
And not just because I plan
to kill the both of you,

31:48.574 --> 31:50.875
but you got a bumpy road ahead.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.444
I don't think we need
to talk about this.

31:53.479 --> 31:54.813
(chuckling)

31:54.846 --> 31:57.249
Y-You kids, you know,

31:57.282 --> 31:58.916
you don't like to think
about the future,

31:58.951 --> 32:00.919
you don't like to make plans,

32:00.952 --> 32:02.653
but unless you want Faith

32:02.688 --> 32:04.089
to gut your friend
like a sea bass,

32:04.123 --> 32:05.624
you will show
a little respect

32:05.656 --> 32:07.058
for your elders.

32:07.093 --> 32:08.460
You're not my elder.

32:08.493 --> 32:10.395
I got a lot of years on you.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.797
Yeah, and that's just
one of the things

32:11.829 --> 32:14.232
you're gonna
have to deal with.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.634
You're immortal.
She's not.

32:15.666 --> 32:16.902
It's not easy.

32:16.934 --> 32:18.836
I married my
Edna Mae in '03,

32:18.869 --> 32:21.472
and I was with her
right until the end.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.174
Not a pretty picture.

32:24.843 --> 32:26.979
Wrinkled and senile

32:27.012 --> 32:29.847
and cursing me for my youth.

32:29.881 --> 32:31.150
Wasn't our happiest time.

32:33.219 --> 32:35.020
And let's forget the fact

32:35.054 --> 32:38.156
that any moment of true
happiness will turn you evil.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.825
(snickers)

32:39.857 --> 32:41.859
I mean, come on,
what kind of a life

32:41.893 --> 32:43.795
can you offer her?

32:43.828 --> 32:46.365
I don't see a lot of Sunday
picnics in the offing.

32:46.397 --> 32:48.099
I see skulking in the shadows,

32:48.134 --> 32:49.601
hiding from the sun.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.436
She's a blossoming
young girl,

32:51.470 --> 32:53.138
and you want to keep her from
the life she should have

32:53.172 --> 32:54.472
until it's
passed her by.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.707
And by God,

32:55.740 --> 32:58.144
I think that's a little selfish.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.213
Is that what you
came back from hell for?

33:02.248 --> 33:05.384
Is that your
greater purpose?

33:10.556 --> 33:12.523
Make the trade.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.041
Well, that went as smoothly...

33:30.076 --> 33:31.710
Nobody moves!

33:39.718 --> 33:41.853
I knew you kids
were up to something.

33:41.886 --> 33:44.089
Snyder, get out of here.

33:44.123 --> 33:45.891
You're not giving orders,
young lady.

33:45.923 --> 33:47.925
I suppose you're
going to tell me

33:47.959 --> 33:50.362
I won't find drugs in this box.

33:52.431 --> 33:53.265
Wait!

33:53.298 --> 33:54.599
Principal Snyder...

33:57.603 --> 33:59.371
...I think we have
a problem.

33:59.404 --> 34:02.874
Mr. Mayor, I had no idea you...

34:03.942 --> 34:06.744
I'm terribly sorry.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.012
No, it's I who should apologize.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.715
I mean,
coming down here at night...

34:09.748 --> 34:12.050
What must you be thinking?

34:12.083 --> 34:13.784
But you see,
I just needed to--

34:13.818 --> 34:15.454
uh, no, don't do that!

34:16.621 --> 34:20.056
(hissing, guard screaming)

34:24.829 --> 34:26.898
(screaming)

34:43.614 --> 34:45.050
Oh, God.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.885
Where'd it go?

34:46.918 --> 34:48.420
Get that door open!

34:48.454 --> 34:51.257
No! You can't let
that thing out of here.

34:51.289 --> 34:52.657
(keys clatter on floor)

34:52.690 --> 34:54.925
Uh, I still want to know
where it went.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.027
Listen.

34:57.295 --> 34:59.097
(skittering)

35:00.465 --> 35:01.699
Boss!

35:24.889 --> 35:26.525
I wouldn't leave that open.

35:26.557 --> 35:28.659
(skittering noises)

35:31.996 --> 35:33.231
(hissing)

35:45.043 --> 35:45.976
No!

35:54.085 --> 35:54.920
(squeals weakly)

35:59.391 --> 36:00.326
Is that all of them?

36:00.358 --> 36:02.693
Uh... not really.

36:02.728 --> 36:05.664
You see, there's
about, uh, 50...

36:05.697 --> 36:08.534
billion of these happy
little critters in here.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.001
Would you like to see?

36:12.338 --> 36:14.539
Raise your hand
if you're invulnerable.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.210
Faith, let's go.

36:26.385 --> 36:27.952
Faith.

36:38.128 --> 36:41.032
Snyder, you alive in there?

36:42.634 --> 36:44.202
You...

36:44.235 --> 36:46.838
all of you...

36:46.871 --> 36:49.240
why couldn't you be dealing
drugs like normal people?

37:10.329 --> 37:12.063
Well, that went
swimmingly.

37:15.733 --> 37:16.967
We did all right.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.476
So Faith was like,
"I'm gonna beat you up."

37:24.510 --> 37:25.911
And I'm all,
"I'm not afraid of you."

37:25.943 --> 37:28.045
And then she had the knife,
which was less fun.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.981
And then, oh,
I-I told her,

37:30.014 --> 37:31.782
"You made your choice.
Buffy was your friend..."

37:31.817 --> 37:33.885
Yes. This is fascinating,

37:33.918 --> 37:36.755
but just to get
back to the point.

37:36.788 --> 37:39.824
You actually had your hands
on the Books of Ascension?

37:39.858 --> 37:41.992
Volumes One through Five.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.929
Is there anything that you can
remember about them

37:43.961 --> 37:45.396
that could be of use to us?

37:45.431 --> 37:46.632
Anything at all?

37:46.664 --> 37:50.668
Well, I was in a hurry,

37:50.702 --> 37:53.271
and what I did read
was kind of involved.

37:53.304 --> 37:56.074
If you ask me, way overwritten.

37:56.106 --> 37:57.576
Oh.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.010
Actually,
there were

37:59.043 --> 38:00.911
a few pages that were
kind of interesting,

38:00.945 --> 38:02.780
but I didn't have a chance
to read them fully.

38:06.318 --> 38:08.152
See what you can make of them?

38:14.793 --> 38:16.795
This is your night
for suave, Will.

38:16.827 --> 38:18.262
You should get
captured more often.

38:18.295 --> 38:20.699
No, thank you.

38:20.731 --> 38:24.635
Well, let's hope there's
something useful in those pages.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.637
The mayor has
the Box of Gavrock.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.806
And as of now,

38:28.840 --> 38:31.677
we are right back
where we started.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.378
Wouldn't you say?

38:46.592 --> 38:48.960
Deep thoughts?

38:48.994 --> 38:50.396
Deep and meaningful.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.898
As in...?

38:53.931 --> 38:56.735
As in, I'm never
getting out of here.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.168
I kept thinking

38:58.202 --> 39:00.806
if I stopped
the mayor or...

39:00.838 --> 39:03.541
but I was kidding myself.

39:03.574 --> 39:05.744
And there's always
gonna be something.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.344
I'm a Sunnydale girl.

39:07.378 --> 39:09.014
No other choice.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.681
It must be tough.

39:10.715 --> 39:14.519
I mean, here I am,
and I can do anything I want.

39:14.552 --> 39:16.755
I can go to any college
in the country--

39:16.788 --> 39:18.356
four or five in Europe,
if I want.

39:18.389 --> 39:19.925
Please tell me you're going
somewhere with this.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.226
No.

39:22.728 --> 39:25.864
I'm not going anywhere.

39:25.896 --> 39:27.865
UC Sunnydale?

39:27.898 --> 39:31.335
I will be matriculating
with the class of 2003.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.204
Are you serious?

39:33.237 --> 39:35.907
Say, isn't that
where you're going?

39:35.940 --> 39:37.208
Oh!

39:37.242 --> 39:40.277
(squealing and laughing)

39:40.311 --> 39:42.079
I can't believe it.
Are you serious?

39:42.112 --> 39:45.250
Wait, what am I saying?
You can't.

39:45.282 --> 39:46.251
What do you mean, I can't?

39:46.284 --> 39:47.753
I won't let you.

39:47.786 --> 39:49.621
Of the two people here,

39:49.655 --> 39:51.523
which is
the boss of me?

39:51.556 --> 39:52.757
There are better schools.

39:52.791 --> 39:55.193
Sunnydale's not bad,

39:55.226 --> 39:57.262
a-and I can design
my own curriculum.

39:57.295 --> 39:58.929
Okay, well, there are
safer schools.

39:58.963 --> 40:01.567
There are safer prisons.

40:01.599 --> 40:03.534
I can't let you stay
because of me.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.369
Actually, this isn't about you.

40:05.402 --> 40:07.237
Although I'm fond--
don't get me wrong-- of you.

40:07.271 --> 40:08.574
The other night--

40:08.606 --> 40:11.309
you know,
being captured and all,

40:11.342 --> 40:13.143
facing off with Faith--

40:13.177 --> 40:16.914
things just...
kind of got clear.

40:16.947 --> 40:19.217
I mean, you've been
fighting evil here

40:19.250 --> 40:22.320
for three years, and
I've helped some,

40:22.353 --> 40:23.789
and now we're
supposed to decide

40:23.822 --> 40:26.090
what we want to do
with our lives.

40:26.123 --> 40:29.226
And I just realized
that's what I want to do.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.297
Fight evil,
help people.

40:32.329 --> 40:34.833
I mean, I-I think
it's worth doing.

40:34.865 --> 40:36.568
And I don't
think you do it

40:36.601 --> 40:38.603
because you have to.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.137
It's a good fight, Buffy,

40:40.170 --> 40:41.572
and I want in.

40:41.606 --> 40:44.576
I kind of love you.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.244
(chuckles)

40:46.277 --> 40:49.648
And besides, I have a shot
at being a bad-ass Wicca.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.115
And what better place to learn?

40:51.148 --> 40:53.251
I feel the need for more sugar

40:53.284 --> 40:54.853
than the human body can handle.

40:54.885 --> 40:56.186
Mochas?

40:56.221 --> 40:57.856
Yes, please.

40:59.525 --> 41:01.092
It's weird.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.193
You look at something,
and you think you know

41:03.228 --> 41:05.163
exactly what
you're seeing, and...

41:05.195 --> 41:07.164
and then you find out
it's something else entirely.

41:07.197 --> 41:08.833
Neat, huh?

41:08.867 --> 41:10.467
Sometimes it is.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.318
Chase, what
are you doing?

41:27.351 --> 41:28.853
Your break's been over
for ten minutes.

41:28.887 --> 41:30.221
I still need you
to restock the shelves

41:30.255 --> 41:32.824
and sweep out
the storage room.

41:32.858 --> 41:34.259
Let's go!

41:36.695 --> 41:37.896
(footsteps receding)

41:37.929 --> 41:39.931
*

42:04.021 --> 42:05.824
It's gonna be fun.

42:05.856 --> 42:07.693
Will and I are
gonna go on Saturday

42:07.726 --> 42:09.427
and look at the campus.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.528
I'm hoping my mom
will let me live there.

42:11.563 --> 42:14.164
It's too far to
come home every night.

42:14.199 --> 42:17.434
Plus the whole
lack-of-cool factor.

42:17.467 --> 42:19.704
Either way, I'll be
close to your place.

42:23.373 --> 42:25.744
I don't know what the mayor
was talking about.

42:27.878 --> 42:30.047
How could he know
anything about us?

42:30.081 --> 42:31.949
Yeah, well, he's evil.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.251
Big time.

42:34.418 --> 42:35.621
He doesn't even know

42:35.653 --> 42:37.422
what a lasting
relationship is.

42:37.454 --> 42:39.791
No.

42:39.824 --> 42:41.425
Probably the only
lasting relationship

42:41.458 --> 42:45.463
he's ever had
is with... evil.

42:45.496 --> 42:48.099
(chuckling):
Yeah.

42:48.132 --> 42:50.568
Big, stupid, evil guy.

42:52.137 --> 42:54.706
We'll be okay.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.340
We will.

43:45.724 --> 43:48.159
Grr. Argh.
