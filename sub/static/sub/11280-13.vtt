WEBVTT

00:00.634 --> 00:02.603
* Freeze frame!

00:05.773 --> 00:09.043
You remembered to put an
extra pair of socks on, right?

00:09.077 --> 00:10.010
Yes, ma'am.

00:10.044 --> 00:11.645
WEATHERMAN :
Today in New York City,

00:11.679 --> 00:13.714
expect a lot of snow,
and it's coming down fast.

00:13.747 --> 00:16.650
We've had six inches reported
the last hour in Manhattan

00:16.684 --> 00:19.420
and four inches in Park Slope.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.155
Mom, do I have
to go to school?

00:21.189 --> 00:22.756
I mean, it's snowing
like crazy.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.692
It's snow, Chris,
not Armageddon,

00:24.725 --> 00:25.759
Now hurry up.

00:25.793 --> 00:28.229
You know the buses are
going to be running slow.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.430
Go.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.631
CHRIS ROCK:
Because my mother wanted us

00:30.664 --> 00:32.433
to get the best education
possible,

00:32.466 --> 00:36.270
as long as school was open,
we had to go no matter what.

00:37.705 --> 00:38.672
Ooh, baby.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.408
Your temperature is 103.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.110
Can I stay home from school?

00:42.143 --> 00:44.178
No. Just put this ice
pack under your hat.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.213
You'll be all right.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.817
Ooh, baby, I think
you got food poisoning.

00:49.850 --> 00:50.851
Can I stay home
from school?

00:50.884 --> 00:52.620
No.
Drink this ipecac.

00:52.653 --> 00:53.687
You'll be all right.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.588
While I was on the road,

00:54.622 --> 00:56.490
Drew and Tonya were
on the couch.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.692
Okay, come on,
y'all, let's go.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.794
...and Saint Seraphim
Elementary.

01:00.828 --> 01:03.264
In Bedford Stuyvesant,
latest school closings

01:03.297 --> 01:04.632
include Linville Elementary,

01:04.665 --> 01:07.801
Lamont Sanford Junior High,
and Dolemite Elementary.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.470
Ooh, yes!

01:09.503 --> 01:10.804
School is closed!
Yeah!

01:10.838 --> 01:12.740
:
We're staying home from school.
It's cold out there.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.108
We're staying home
from school.
What's going on?

01:14.142 --> 01:15.809
Our school just closed.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.245
What?
Yeah, we get
to stay home.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.379
Yeah!
Where's Chris?

01:18.412 --> 01:19.747
He already left.

01:19.780 --> 01:20.714
His school's not closed?

01:20.748 --> 01:22.816
Well, they didn't
mention it on the news.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.385
Is he going to be all right?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.753
Oh, I'm sure
he'll be fine, baby.

01:25.786 --> 01:26.620
But look,
I got to go.

01:26.654 --> 01:27.855
I left your breakfast
on the stove.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.858
Wait. Drew and Tonya are
going to be here all day?

01:30.891 --> 01:32.793
What? You got another home
to take them to?

01:32.826 --> 01:34.228
I got to go,
baby, I'm late.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.496
Love you.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.831
Meanwhile, there were more kids
at my house

01:37.865 --> 01:39.600
than there were at my school.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.775
Hello?

01:47.808 --> 01:49.877
Is anyone here?

01:49.910 --> 01:52.813
I wouldn't put it past all
the other kids to hide from me.

01:52.846 --> 02:02.890

TELEVISION

02:32.786 --> 02:33.787
Whoa!

02:33.821 --> 02:35.789
Man, what is wrong with you,
sneaking up on people?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.191
Chris, what are
you doing here?

02:37.225 --> 02:38.926
School was
cancelled today.

02:38.959 --> 02:39.793
Since when?

02:39.827 --> 02:41.962
They announced it
about an hour ago.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.964
I left the house
an hour and a half ago.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.468
Well, I suppose we should
see about getting you home.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.803
Even though Principal Edwards
had traveled the world,

02:49.837 --> 02:52.406
he couldn't get me
back to Brooklyn.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.675
I'm sorry, Chris,
I can't let you go.

02:54.708 --> 02:55.809
Why not?

02:55.843 --> 02:57.845
Our phones are out.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.347
You're not allowed
to leave school

02:59.380 --> 03:02.416
without the consent
of a parent or guardian.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.617
So you're saying
the only reason why

03:03.651 --> 03:04.852
I can't leave
is 'cause I'm here?

03:04.885 --> 03:07.221
That, my friend,
is a paradox.

03:08.756 --> 03:09.990
Sounds more like C-block.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.792
Why would your mother

03:11.825 --> 03:13.994
allow you to go out
in weather like this?

03:14.027 --> 03:15.329
She's crazy.

03:15.363 --> 03:16.864
She doesn't like us
to miss school.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.867
Let's not disappoint her.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.471
While I was getting snowed in,
back at home, the word was out.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.906
To repeat, city buses
are experiencing delays

03:25.939 --> 03:27.541
of up to four hours

03:27.575 --> 03:29.977
due to closings
and hazardous conditions.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.880
Now here's a list
of the latest school closures.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.282
Corleone Junior High...

03:34.315 --> 03:36.450
Daddy, look, Chris'
school is closed.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.918
What?

03:37.951 --> 03:40.254
DREW:
Oh, see, it says Corleone
Junior High School.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.656
If his school is closed,
how come he hasn't called?

03:42.690 --> 03:44.558
Maybe he got trapped
in a snowdrift

03:44.592 --> 03:46.460
and had to eat
his own mouth to survive.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.829
That's a thought.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.331
Where are you going?

03:50.364 --> 03:51.999
I'm going to get your brother.

03:52.032 --> 03:52.900
Who's going to
stay with us?

03:52.933 --> 03:55.869
Oh... I'll be right back.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.638
Even though
the weather was horrible,

03:57.671 --> 03:59.039
my mother liked riding
the subway.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.675
Being with strangers is
a lot less stressful

04:01.709 --> 04:02.743
than being with your family.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.645
This is a stickup!

04:04.678 --> 04:05.646
Shut up!

04:05.679 --> 04:07.581
Aw, damn.
Aw, damn.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.419
CONDUCTOR :
We're sorry for the sudden stop.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.320
If you'll all remain seated,

04:12.353 --> 04:13.854
we'll be on our way
in a few minutes.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.923
Aw, damn!

04:15.956 --> 04:17.658
Well?

04:17.691 --> 04:19.427
"Well" nothing.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.828
This is still a stickup.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.365
Will you be quiet?

04:26.400 --> 04:27.901
I was the only one in school,

04:27.935 --> 04:30.971
but Principal Edwards handled
things by the book.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.039
He took attendance.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.342
Caroline?

04:34.375 --> 04:35.443
Chris?

04:35.476 --> 04:37.044
Here.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.847
Chris.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.014
Eddie?

04:41.048 --> 04:42.583
We said
the Pledge of Allegiance.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.786
BOTH:
One nation, under God,
indivisible

04:45.819 --> 04:48.922
with liberty
and justice for all.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.758
Since I was the only one
in class,

04:50.791 --> 04:52.626
he let me say
the Black Pledge of Allegiance.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.095
BOTH:
One nation under a groove

04:55.128 --> 04:58.098
getting down just
for the funk of it.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.834
One nation
and we're on the move.

05:00.868 --> 05:04.438
Nothing can stop us now.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.707
After lunch,
we sang "Aqua Boogie."

05:08.409 --> 05:11.044
After that, we got down
to serious business.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.946
All right, class.

05:12.980 --> 05:17.951
First up, I'm giving you
a quiz on Pearl Harbor.

05:17.985 --> 05:22.089
What? Ms. Morello didn't have
a quiz planned for today.

05:22.122 --> 05:26.794
Consider it a surprise,
just like Pearl Harbor.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.663
Eyes on your own paper.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.132
My father couldn't leave
Drew and Tonya home alone,

05:32.165 --> 05:34.034
because if you pull
that Home Alone crap

05:34.067 --> 05:36.103
in a black neighborhood,
they take away your kids.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.104
Can I help you?

05:37.137 --> 05:38.138
I was looking
for Mr. Omar.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.973
Oh, hey,
Mr. Julius.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.042
Yeah, this is my friend
Mrs. Booker.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.744
I'm sorry about your husband.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.046
Yeah, caught a deadly case
of botulism.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.047
Tragic, tragic.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.115
How did you know...

05:48.148 --> 05:51.051
Baby, why don't you go
and put that record on for me?

05:51.084 --> 05:52.420
Okay.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.558
Yeah, wha-- so, uh,
what can I do for you?

05:57.591 --> 05:58.959
I need to pick
Chris up from school

05:58.992 --> 06:00.494
and I was wondering if
you could keep an eye

06:00.528 --> 06:02.095
on Drew and Tonya
till I get back?

06:02.129 --> 06:04.665
Mr. Omar had another back
to keep an eye on.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.099
Yeah, can't you get
somebody else, man?

06:06.133 --> 06:07.034
I really need your help.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.537
I mean, all you got to
do is check on them.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.771
They'll be easy,
I promise.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.540
Speaking of easy...

06:12.573 --> 06:13.674
I don't know, man.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.075
I'll take ten dollars
off the rent.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.510
I'll be down in a minute.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.111
Thank you.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.448
Any questions?

06:20.481 --> 06:21.482
Anyone?

06:23.183 --> 06:24.752
Yes, Chris?

06:24.785 --> 06:28.722
I'm the only one in the
entire city that's in school.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.191
So, why should I have to learn
when everybody else is sitting

06:31.224 --> 06:33.160
on their couch watching
The Price Is Right?

06:33.193 --> 06:37.631
Chris, the true measure
of a man is not what he does

06:37.665 --> 06:39.633
when he is being watched.

06:39.667 --> 06:43.103
It's what he does
when he is alone.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.639
Technically, this isn't
a real school day.

06:45.673 --> 06:48.809
If you haven't noticed,
I'm not supposed to be here.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.411
So why should
I take classes?

06:53.180 --> 06:54.648
All right.

06:54.682 --> 06:57.084
Do whatever you want.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.554
So you're saying that if I get
up and walk out of that door,

07:00.588 --> 07:02.089
you won't do anything
to stop me?

07:02.122 --> 07:04.157
No.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.793
Good-bye.

07:05.826 --> 07:06.927
As I was storming out,

07:06.960 --> 07:08.962
the storm outside
was picking up.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.067
I haven't seen

07:14.101 --> 07:15.536
a sea of white like this

07:15.569 --> 07:17.437
since the Republican
National Convention.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.910
Come on, in the bag!
Put it in the bag!

07:22.943 --> 07:24.778
Get to the back!
Come on!

07:24.812 --> 07:26.213
CHRIS:
My mother had lost her money,

07:26.246 --> 07:28.148
but there was only
so much she could take.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.917
Good day to rob a train, huh?

07:29.950 --> 07:30.718
Watch your mouth!

07:30.751 --> 07:31.719
Why?!

07:31.752 --> 07:32.986
You done already took my money!

07:33.020 --> 07:34.221
What else you gonna take,
my seat?

07:34.254 --> 07:35.255
I might shoot you!

07:35.288 --> 07:36.924
And you might go to jail!

07:36.957 --> 07:37.825
You got six bullets

07:37.858 --> 07:39.092
and nine passengers,

07:39.126 --> 07:40.794
which leaves
three witnesses,

07:40.828 --> 07:42.930
and 25 years to life!

07:42.963 --> 07:44.998
Don't shoot her, shoot me.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.166
Don't tell me who to shoot!

07:46.199 --> 07:47.501
What are you,
trying to get shot?!

07:47.535 --> 07:48.135
Shut up!

07:50.203 --> 07:51.104
Will you be quiet?!

07:51.138 --> 07:52.039
Sit down.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.841
While my mother
was pushing her luck,

07:53.874 --> 07:56.610
Mr. Omar was trying
to pull a fast one.

07:56.644 --> 08:00.180
Hey, I got peanut butter
and jelly, fried bologna

08:00.213 --> 08:03.250
and mustard,
Kool-Aid and chips.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.251
The homeless shelter special.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.352
Anything else?

08:05.385 --> 08:07.921
I thought you were supposed
to be staying with us.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.990
No, I told you father
I would check on y'all.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.859
So I'm checking on you.
You okay?

08:11.892 --> 08:12.526
Yeah.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.894
All right, so
I'll be back

08:13.927 --> 08:15.529
to check on
you again.
Mr. Omar...

08:17.631 --> 08:19.767
Can you make me
some hot chocolate?

08:21.234 --> 08:22.903
Okay. Hot chocolate it is.

08:24.905 --> 08:25.706
Oh, Mr. Omar?

08:25.739 --> 08:26.907
Uh
Could you please

08:26.940 --> 08:27.941
make me some cheese toast?

08:27.975 --> 08:30.243
Cheese toast and hot chocolate.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.179
Okay, great.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.048
While Mr. Omar
was stuck babysitting,

08:35.082 --> 08:36.316
my father was just plain stuck.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.002
Should've bought
those snow tires.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.236
My father was willing

08:56.269 --> 08:58.772
to brave the elements
to save his son,

08:58.806 --> 09:00.073
but to save money,

09:00.107 --> 09:02.175
he bought the cheapest tires
known to man.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.252
He's the only black out
in a whiteout.

09:21.328 --> 09:24.097
With too much snow to stay
outside, I went back inside

09:24.131 --> 09:26.333
to find crouching tiger,
hidden principal.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.701
Principal Edwards?

09:29.336 --> 09:31.138
I thought you left.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.907
Yeah, but I came back.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.308
Hyah!

09:35.342 --> 09:38.278
Captain Obvious
strikes again.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.312
Hoo-wah!

09:39.346 --> 09:41.649
I'm sorry.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.651
Are you really?

09:43.684 --> 09:45.385
You did what you
wanted to do.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.955
:
Shh-woo, yah!

09:47.988 --> 09:49.289
Just didn't work out

09:49.322 --> 09:51.024
the way you planned.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.093
It's not like I didn't want
to take my classes.

09:53.126 --> 09:56.930
I haven't missed a day
of school all year.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.666
I work hard.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.368
It's just that the one day
I could spend at home relaxing,

10:01.401 --> 10:03.003
I'm stuck here with you.

10:03.036 --> 10:06.139
So what's the point
in doing schoolwork today?

10:08.275 --> 10:10.077
You know what?
You're right.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.344
I am?

10:11.378 --> 10:13.714
Sure you are.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.348
So what now?

10:15.382 --> 10:18.118
Ninja lessons?

10:21.288 --> 10:22.422
I'm sorry
about that.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.925
Look here, if you're gonna
keep talking about getting shot,

10:24.958 --> 10:26.359
you need to sit
over there somewhere.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.227
I'm sorry.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.396
I figured I didn't
have much to lose.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.031
Why?

10:31.064 --> 10:33.300
Yesterday was my
61st birthday

10:33.333 --> 10:36.804
and... nobody in
my family called.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.039
I was headed to the
Brooklyn Bridge

10:39.072 --> 10:41.108
to jump off.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.342
You were gonna jump off a bridge

10:42.375 --> 10:44.778
'cause you didn't
get a phone call?

10:44.812 --> 10:46.146
No wonder they
didn't call you.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.280
You're selfish.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.383
A 61-year-old gonna
jump off a bridge

10:50.417 --> 10:52.219
'cause he didn't
get a phone call.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.287
I wouldn't call you either.
It's too much pressure.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.957
You don't know
anything about me.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.793
I know you're too damn old
to be jumping off bridges.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.229
Well, it's none of
your business anyway.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.164
Wait a minute, you're
the one standing up
talking 'bout,

11:04.197 --> 11:05.999
"Don't shoot her,
shoot me."

11:06.033 --> 11:07.467
Well, then why didn't
you let him shoot me?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.369
I'm not gonna
have people thinking

11:09.402 --> 11:11.739
you saved my life. You ain't
nothing but a big baby.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.707
Scarface,
whatever you do,

11:13.741 --> 11:16.409
don't shoot him.
Oh, could you shoot me, please?

11:16.443 --> 11:18.211
It's the only way my boss
is gonna believe this.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.249
Since we'd done a little work,

11:22.282 --> 11:24.484
Principal Edwards decided
we could have a little fun.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.506
* For all you sucker MCs
perpetrating a fraud *

11:46.539 --> 11:49.442
* Your rhymes are cold whack
and keep the crowd cold bored *

11:49.476 --> 11:51.511
* You're the kind of guy
that girl a ignored *

11:51.544 --> 11:54.047
* I'm drivin' a Caddy,
you fixin' a Ford *

11:54.081 --> 11:56.216
* My name is Joseph Simmons,
but my middle name's Lord *

11:56.249 --> 11:57.450
* And when I'm rockin'
on the mic *

11:57.484 --> 11:59.019
* You should all applaud
because we're *

11:59.052 --> 12:01.188
* Wheelin', dealin',
we got a funny feelin' *

12:01.221 --> 12:03.490
* We rock from the floor
up the ceilin' *

12:03.523 --> 12:06.126
* We groove it, you move it,
it has been proven *

12:06.159 --> 12:08.461
* We calmed the savage beast
because our music is soothin' *

12:08.495 --> 12:11.398
Back at home, Drew and Tonya
were monopolizing

12:11.431 --> 12:12.065
all of Mr. Omar's time.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.967
Ha! Boardwalk with a hotel.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.136
Looks like somebody
owes me $2,000.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.271
Oh, dang. Tragic.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.807
Um, Mr. Omar?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.975
How come every time
we see you with a woman,

12:22.009 --> 12:23.176
their husband just died?

12:23.210 --> 12:25.245
Well, that's because

12:25.278 --> 12:27.414
I'm a funeral
director, baby.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.950
But when the wives die,

12:29.983 --> 12:31.885
how come you don't
make friends with the husbands?

12:31.919 --> 12:35.288
Oh, well, men don't
need as much attention.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.957
Man, if my wife died,

12:36.990 --> 12:39.860
I'd be crying, sitting
at home by myself

12:39.893 --> 12:41.028
wondering what
I'm gonna do...

12:41.061 --> 12:42.896
how to go on.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.065
I'd be wishing anybody
would talk to me.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.900
Well, women are sensitive,

12:46.934 --> 12:49.069
you know, in a different
kind of way.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.104
Oh, I thought
that women were like

12:51.138 --> 12:52.539
that because they
were desperate.

12:52.572 --> 12:53.974
Roll the dice, baby.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.109
Here you go.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.545
Ha!
This wasn't

12:58.578 --> 13:01.114
so bad after all.

13:01.148 --> 13:04.084
Hey! You know,
that's a cool vase.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.253
That's three centuries old.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.821
Wow.

13:07.855 --> 13:09.056
So what do all
those markings mean?

13:09.089 --> 13:13.326
They represent honor.

13:13.360 --> 13:17.030
They did until Paris Hilton
tattooed them on her ass.

13:17.064 --> 13:20.367
I wanted this for my wife.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.534
You're married?

13:21.568 --> 13:23.403
I was.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.105
We split up a few years ago.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.439
She took the money

13:26.473 --> 13:28.942
and I kept the vase.
Figures.

13:28.976 --> 13:32.445
This vase...

13:32.479 --> 13:34.247
changed my life.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.415
How's that?

13:35.448 --> 13:38.451
It taught me one
of life's great lessons.

13:38.485 --> 13:42.122
All that we have been or done

13:42.155 --> 13:43.957
is in the past.

13:43.991 --> 13:47.127
Live in the now.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.131
What?

13:53.100 --> 13:55.268
I wonder what Eastern
philosophy has to say

13:55.302 --> 13:57.304
about crazy glue.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.545
Girl, what you crying about?

14:05.578 --> 14:06.980
All he said was, "Be quiet."

14:07.014 --> 14:10.217
It's not that. I just broke up
with my fiancé.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.551
This ring looks pretty cheap.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.520
It is cheap.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.923
So that's why you broke
up with him? 'Cause he
doesn't have any money?

14:15.956 --> 14:19.092
No, I broke up with him because
I want him to get a job,

14:19.126 --> 14:21.228
but thinks he's going
to be a movie director.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.096
Well, at least he ain't
out robbing trains.

14:23.130 --> 14:26.333
And get this, he took my credit
card to make his last film.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.036
Now how you gonna
make a movie
on a credit card?

14:29.069 --> 14:30.437
What's Mr. Movie
Director's name?

14:30.470 --> 14:33.506
Sheldon.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.542
Now, how you gonna
be a movie director

14:35.575 --> 14:36.977
with a name like Sheldon?

14:37.010 --> 14:39.279
His friends call him Spike.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.148
Oh, girl, that's worse.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.649
Trust me.
You can do better

14:42.682 --> 14:44.117
than a Black man
named Spike.

14:44.151 --> 14:46.653
Try and find a guy
with a nice name,

14:46.686 --> 14:48.521
like, like,
like Orenthal.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.390
That's nice.
She later became the first

14:50.423 --> 14:53.260
Black girl in history
to be glad she wasn't White.

14:53.293 --> 14:56.063
The snow stopped the traffic,
but it couldn't stop Risky.

14:56.096 --> 14:59.166
RISKY:
Julius! Julius!

14:59.199 --> 15:01.468
Risky?

15:01.501 --> 15:03.170
What are you doing
out here, man?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.338
Chris is stuck at school.
I gotta get him.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.706
Can you help me out?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.175
Oh, sorry, no room, man.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.376
Me and my man, Nanook,

15:09.409 --> 15:11.211
out here trying
to make money on these

15:11.244 --> 15:12.545
cross-country skis.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.048
You want a pair?

15:17.550 --> 15:19.052
How much?

15:20.653 --> 15:22.389
You know I didn't
mean to break it.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.325
It's okay.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.727
It's just a vase.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.629
A vase that changed my life.

15:32.032 --> 15:35.735
Sometimes I wish I could
change my life.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.670
Go places like you.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.240
Get away from the school.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.674
The neighborhood.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.511
Caruso.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.679
Doesn't work like that.

15:46.713 --> 15:50.383
As long as you're you,
they'll always be a Caruso.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.586
I thought about living
in Japan.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.222
Arigato, Slappy.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.424
In London...
Cheerio, Nipsy.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.993
Morocco...
Asalamalakem, Flip.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.264
So what should I do?

16:05.465 --> 16:07.767
Just because you're you...

16:07.800 --> 16:10.503
doesn't mean you can't
be somebody else.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.039
That's called schizophrenia.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.240
Now what about you?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.142
I mean, you traveled
all around the world.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.676
Why'd you come back
to be a principal?

16:16.709 --> 16:18.745
I am going to tell
you a story

16:18.778 --> 16:21.781
that I've never
told anyone else.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.783
Not my wife, my priest,

16:23.816 --> 16:26.219
my shrink, no one.
I hope he doesn't

16:26.253 --> 16:28.121
say, "If I did it,
here's how it happened."

16:28.155 --> 16:31.158
It all began
at a pancake house
in Minneapolis.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.127
GREG:
Hey, Chris.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.528
What are you guys
doing down there?

16:35.562 --> 16:39.166
Nothing, just talking.
What are you doing here?

16:39.199 --> 16:41.534
Well, I called your house,
and Drew said you were here.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.070
I couldn't
believe it,

16:43.103 --> 16:45.405
so I had to come
and check for myself.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.208
Well... think I'll, uh...

16:48.241 --> 16:51.044
step outside and check
on the weather.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.479
See about getting
you home, Chris.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.215
Yeah, all right.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.387
Good, uh... good talking
to you, Greg.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.555
You, too, Principal Edwards.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.260
Omar, can I talk
to you a second?

17:07.294 --> 17:08.428
Oh, be right back.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.832
Monopoly wasn't all
he was losing.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.667
How much longer
are you going to
be down here?

17:14.701 --> 17:17.070
Well, the way Drew's
playing, not much longer.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.172
He got me for $2,000.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.541
I didn't come here to hear
you talk about Monopoly.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.176
Mr. Omar, it's your turn.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.313
Uh, here I come. Look, I told
Mr. Julius I would

17:26.346 --> 17:28.181
watch the kids and that's
what I'm gonna do.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.349
I'm sorry.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.218
You watching the kids?
I'm going home.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.686
Well, you'd better take
those pumps off and put
on some snow shoes

17:33.720 --> 17:35.855
or you ain't gonna make it.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.258
Excuse me, uh, Scarface.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.294
Can I talk to you for a minute?

17:41.328 --> 17:44.697
My mother never talked
to anyone for just a minute.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.239
Now, are you sure
you want to do this?

17:52.272 --> 17:53.773
What difference
does it make to you?

17:53.806 --> 17:55.775
Well, didn't your mother
teach you better

17:55.808 --> 17:56.809
than to go around
robbing people?

17:56.843 --> 17:59.579
She's the one who taught me
how to rob people.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.748
Well, if I was your mother,

18:01.781 --> 18:04.184
I would've knocked
the rob out of you

18:04.217 --> 18:05.752
a long time ago.
LUTHER:
Listen to her.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.520
She's a good person.
Hear that?

18:07.554 --> 18:11.191
I just wish I'd met her before
I got my wife's sister pregnant.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.128
You got your wife's
sister pregnant?

18:15.162 --> 18:16.496
Uh, just once.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.265
All I'm saying is,

18:18.298 --> 18:21.568
is that you're better than this.

18:22.802 --> 18:26.206
And at least your son and your
nephew ain't the same person.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.376
Thank you.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.413
Rochelle.

18:37.450 --> 18:41.188
When you get home, call my dad
and tell him I'm on the way.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.522
No problem.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.224
Ah, well, see ya.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.226
Man, see you later.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.302
The adventure was
just ending for me,

18:55.335 --> 18:57.737
but it was just beginning
for my father.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.839
Chris!

18:59.872 --> 19:01.808
I'm here!

19:01.841 --> 19:03.576
Chris!

19:03.610 --> 19:05.412
I'm here!

19:05.445 --> 19:07.314
Chris!

19:07.347 --> 19:09.849
I'm here to take you home!

19:09.882 --> 19:11.951
Chris...!

19:11.984 --> 19:15.222
Most days we were together,
we couldn't wait to be apart.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.623
But every now and again,

19:16.656 --> 19:19.192
it felt really good
to be together.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.760
It's cold out there today.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.329
That snow is crazy.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.763
I went all the way
to your school.

19:23.796 --> 19:24.997
What happened to you?

19:25.031 --> 19:28.301
I was the only one there, so
soon as I could leave, I left.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.969
You're not gonna believe
what happened to me today.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.238
I got robbed.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.071
ALL:
What?!

19:32.104 --> 19:33.873
Yes. This guy
kept me on the train

19:33.906 --> 19:35.975
for, like, five hours,
took all my money.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.277
How much did you have?

19:37.310 --> 19:38.278
A dollar.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.011
:
Oh.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.580
Huh, that sounds
just like Drew.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.215
We were playing
Monopoly,

19:42.249 --> 19:44.484
and Drew took
all Mr. Omar's money.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.253
Mr. Omar was here?

19:46.286 --> 19:48.355
Yeah, he watched us
after Dad left.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.389
When did you leave?

19:49.422 --> 19:50.657
Right after you left.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.459
You're just now
getting back?

19:52.492 --> 19:53.326
I went to get you!

19:53.360 --> 19:55.295
I'm in a snow storm.
What about Mr. Omar?

19:55.328 --> 19:57.497
(all talking excitedly
over one another)

19:57.530 --> 19:59.232
Y'all know y'all not supposed
to have anybody else.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.933
They closed the school,
there's nowhere for you to go.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.436
When Daddy leaves,
you make sure...

20:03.470 --> 20:06.473
After spending the whole day
inside with Principal Edwards,

20:06.506 --> 20:07.407
I no longer felt

20:07.440 --> 20:08.541
like an outsider.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.676
I had a new friend.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.011
You're late.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.713
What

20:13.746 --> 20:15.014
But what about yesterday?

20:15.047 --> 20:17.284
That was in the past,
we're in the now, Chris.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.718
And now you're late.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.388
See you in detention.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.790
* Everybody hates Chris

20:23.823 --> 20:26.593
