[Donna Summers singing
"Bad Girls"

00:30.709 --> 00:32.750
<i>papi?</i>

00:32.834 --> 00:34.083
See my bag got stolen

00:34.166 --> 00:36.417
and I need some bread
to get on the bus.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.250
You got some change to
spare for a bus ticket?

00:38.333 --> 00:39.667
'You know, get myself home?'

00:42.375 --> 00:44.166
Man, you gotta be jivin' me.

00:44.250 --> 00:45.959
Go on, get out
of the way, baby girl!

00:46.041 --> 00:47.458
Let Marquette do her thing!

00:47.542 --> 00:49.500
Uh-huh. You better split!

00:50.542 --> 00:51.792
He get you bad, baby girl?

00:51.875 --> 00:53.458
Mellow out, Marquette. I'm cool.

00:53.542 --> 00:54.792
Oh, no, you ain't.

00:54.875 --> 00:57.208
Don't get in close 'til
they slide you the bread.

00:57.291 --> 01:00.250
Give 'em half a chance,
cats'll
cop the merchandise for free.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.125
This merchandise
ain't for sale.

01:02.208 --> 01:05.625
Well, it might make life
easier if it was.

01:05.709 --> 01:07.625
Who you saving
yourself for, huh?

01:07.709 --> 01:09.625
Shining knight on a white horse?

01:09.709 --> 01:13.208
Maybe I am.
Take me far away from here.

01:13.291 --> 01:14.417
And go where?

01:14.500 --> 01:15.542
Anywhere I want.

01:15.625 --> 01:17.291
Mm-hmm.

01:20.709 --> 01:23.291
Looks like your knight's
a-callin', baby girl.

01:27.375 --> 01:29.166
Help a girl out, papi?

01:29.250 --> 01:32.583
See, my ma's real sick
and I gotta get home.

01:32.667 --> 01:34.917
I just need some bread
to get on the bus.

02:21.125 --> 02:22.625
(Lilly)
'You're buying, Scotty?'

02:22.709 --> 02:25.250
(Scotty)
'I'll buy even
though it's your turn.'

02:29.125 --> 02:31.458
- You're detectives, correct?
- Yeah.

02:31.542 --> 02:34.875
Where do I go
if I know something?

02:34.959 --> 02:36.875
- 'Bout what?
- My husband.

02:36.959 --> 02:38.500
Low-rent son of a bitch.

02:38.583 --> 02:40.375
I just told him to pack his bags

02:40.458 --> 02:41.625
'and get out of my house.'

02:41.709 --> 02:43.542
I'm filing for divorce.

02:43.625 --> 02:45.458
'Cause he hit you?

02:45.542 --> 02:47.333
He visits prostitutes.

02:47.417 --> 02:51.000
'He's has a fixation
with that type of thing.'

02:51.083 --> 02:53.250
We can't arrest
your husband for that, ma'am.

02:53.333 --> 02:56.041
I can't believe
I married that pervert.

02:58.333 --> 02:59.792
We can arrest him for assault.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.583
If you're willing
to press charges.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.417
I told you why I'm here.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.709
And I told you what we can
do,
and what we can't.

03:08.834 --> 03:12.083
Maybe this will
change your mind.

03:12.166 --> 03:14.667
I found it in that bastard's
belongings.

03:14.750 --> 03:17.959
"Daniella." She one of the
prostitutes he frequented?

03:18.041 --> 03:20.959
No. She's the girl he murdered.

03:26.250 --> 03:27.583
Ex-wife on the warpath.

03:27.667 --> 03:30.000
A woman scorned
makes a hell of a snitch.

03:30.083 --> 03:33.041
Label says the film
was made in '79.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.750
Guy must have been a kid
when he made it.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.542
Mm. Go ahead.

04:07.208 --> 04:08.625
(Scotty)
'Some kid.'

04:50.166 --> 04:53.000
Well, this Kaitlin claims
she just came across this
film.

04:53.083 --> 04:55.166
Just as likely she knew
about it all along.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.333
Saves it for when hubby
falls out of favor.

04:57.417 --> 04:59.917
Presumed homicide. May '79.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.917
A Jane Doe.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.500
- Could be a match.
- Mm.

05:04.583 --> 05:06.750
"Trash bag found
containing women's clothing

05:06.834 --> 05:09.083
"a handbag,
all soaked in blood."

05:09.166 --> 05:10.625
And rose petals.

05:11.792 --> 05:14.875
In the clothes,
the blood,
everywhere.

05:14.959 --> 05:16.041
Never found a body.

05:16.125 --> 05:17.458
Yeah, but with all the skull

05:17.542 --> 05:18.500
and brain matter in there

05:18.583 --> 05:19.750
no way Jane Doe survived.

05:19.834 --> 05:22.875
Probable cause of death,
gunshot to the head.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.291
Get a date on that film?

05:27.375 --> 05:31.959
AV confirmed the year is 1979
off a piece of film leader.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.333
Waiting on what month.

05:33.417 --> 05:36.166
You remember this
Jane Doe from '79, boss?

05:36.250 --> 05:39.250
Yeah, garbage bag full
of rose petals, sure.

05:39.333 --> 05:43.583
Job went cold day
one, no ID, no body,
nothing.

05:43.667 --> 05:46.417
Maybe now we got a name.

05:46.500 --> 05:47.542
Daniella.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.917
AV snapped a print
off the home movie.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.250
Pretty girl.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.625
Lot of good it did her.

06:00.417 --> 06:02.417
My wife's just after my money.

06:04.291 --> 06:05.834
But she won't get a dime.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.417
She didn't earn it.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.250
She earn those bruises, John?

06:10.333 --> 06:11.458
'I didn't kill anybody.'

06:11.542 --> 06:12.792
It looks like you did.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.792
In eight millimeter,
black and white.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.792
Oh, I was a kid.

06:16.875 --> 06:18.458
It was a game.

06:18.542 --> 06:19.834
Ask the girl yourself.

06:19.917 --> 06:21.834
Mm, can't.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.709
She's dead.

06:25.166 --> 06:29.750
Well, one less cesspool
polluting the world. Oh,
well.

06:29.834 --> 06:32.041
Seems to me you got a thing
for those cesspools.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.834
Multiple arrests
for solicitation

06:33.917 --> 06:37.458
five counts of
assaulting working
girls.

06:37.542 --> 06:39.125
You put one
in the
hospital.

06:39.208 --> 06:41.792
Hit 'em if you can't hit it.
That your problem, John?

06:41.875 --> 06:44.166
Those charges were dropped.

06:44.250 --> 06:46.125
How'd you hook up
with Daniella?

06:46.208 --> 06:48.333
How anyone picked up
that type back then.

06:48.417 --> 06:50.208
Driving around
the old bus depot.

06:54.041 --> 06:55.792
Man, come on.
This scene's a bummer.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.834
We wouldn't be here
if that squeamy bitch

06:57.917 --> 06:58.917
didn't run out on us.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.166
'Cause you're a pervert, man.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.500
Cassie didn't want to be
your damn porn star.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.959
Ooh, out of sight.

07:11.792 --> 07:13.500

Hey.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.834
Hey.

07:35.917 --> 07:38.667
So, uh, you ready
to work it, good
lookin'?

07:38.750 --> 07:41.333
I don't hook, I just need
some bread to get home.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.917
Oh, right on.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.083
See we're students.

07:45.166 --> 07:46.500
Film students.

'And we just need
an out of sight'

drop-dead knockout like you

07:49.375 --> 07:50.583

07:52.083 --> 07:53.375
What kinda film?

07:53.458 --> 07:54.417
'Smile for the camera.'

07:54.500 --> 07:55.875
Click
click,
and that's
it.

07:55.959 --> 07:58.625
That better be all,

07:58.709 --> 08:00.208
I got protection.

08:00.291 --> 08:02.709

08:02.792 --> 08:05.208
Just the movie.

08:05.291 --> 08:08.208
Nothing else, right?

08:10.375 --> 08:11.458
Nothing else.

08:12.166 --> 08:13.542
Okay.

08:13.625 --> 08:14.583
Come on.

08:20.458 --> 08:25.000
We scored a joint then we drove
around looking for a motel.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.750
Finally, we ended
up at her place.

08:26.834 --> 08:28.542
And you stuck a gun in her face.

08:28.625 --> 08:30.291
She was alive when we left.

08:30.375 --> 08:32.291
I have the rest
of the film to prove it.

08:33.583 --> 08:34.959
Better hope you can find it.

08:35.041 --> 08:36.917
'Well, if you don't
believe me, ask Chris.'

08:37.000 --> 08:38.333
He was there.

08:38.417 --> 08:39.500
We'll talk to Chris.

08:39.583 --> 08:42.250
Oh, you know, she said
she wasn't a whore

08:42.333 --> 08:44.792
but when Chris got
out of the car to score

08:44.875 --> 08:46.000
she gave me some.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.583
For free.

08:55.041 --> 08:56.250
We were dumb kids.

08:56.333 --> 08:58.083
A few months from
graduating high school

08:58.166 --> 08:59.625
putting our mark on the world.

08:59.709 --> 09:01.083
Aiming for the stars.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.125
We did John's stupid movie
and then we left.

09:04.208 --> 09:05.583
She was alive.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.667
You recall where her place was?

09:07.750 --> 09:09.792
Gray's Ferry.
Dickinson Street.

09:09.875 --> 09:11.041
Good memory there.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.792
Bad one. That night.

09:12.875 --> 09:14.333
How so?

09:14.417 --> 09:16.333
See, John was always crazy.

09:16.417 --> 09:18.500
And that night, I mean..

09:19.542 --> 09:21.041
He just went out of control.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.458
Keep shooting.
Come on, keep shooting.

09:30.542 --> 09:32.208
And you..

09:53.250 --> 09:54.542
Hey, man, let go of her.

09:54.625 --> 09:57.250
- Do it!
- Get off of me.

Don't touch me!

10:03.583 --> 10:04.959
Keep filming
or I'll blow her head off!

10:05.041 --> 10:07.959
Okay, man.
Just don't do anything
stupid.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.917
I'm on film, right?
You got me on camera, right?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.625
Right. I got you.

You're gonna die!

10:13.917 --> 10:15.208
Oh, you're gonna die!

- Get out of here! Get out!
- No!

10:54.458 --> 10:56.208
- She can fight.
- Get out of my place!

10:56.291 --> 10:58.208
- Okay.
- You're a jerk, man.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.959
Come on. Come on!

11:08.000 --> 11:08.917
Get out of here!

11:09.000 --> 11:10.417
'Go! Get out of here!'

11:10.500 --> 11:13.250
(John)
'Let's go. Come on.'

11:13.333 --> 11:15.917
We went home, and that was it.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.125
I never saw that girl again.

11:19.500 --> 11:20.709
What about John?

11:20.792 --> 11:23.083
Kind of stopped
hanging out with him.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.542
Beginning of the end of
the friendship, you might
say.

11:25.625 --> 11:28.417
He said he got some
play from Daniella that
night.

11:28.500 --> 11:32.125
Yeah but John always
said a lot of things.

11:32.208 --> 11:34.667
That girl was just a scared
kid,
she wasn't a pro.

11:34.750 --> 11:37.375
You think John might've gone
back, finished what he
started?

11:39.208 --> 11:40.750
Ever go back
there
yourself, Chris?

11:40.834 --> 11:42.083
For what?

11:42.166 --> 11:43.667
She's a pretty girl.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.333
Maybe you couldn't
leave that alone.

11:45.417 --> 11:47.625
Think I might've blown my
chances that night, don't you?

11:53.625 --> 11:56.125
Stanley Kubrick dug up
the rest of his film.

11:56.208 --> 11:57.625
Had the negative
in his basement.

11:57.709 --> 11:58.959
Brought it in an hour ago.

11:59.041 --> 12:01.125
(Lilly)
'A/V transferred it to
video.'

12:01.208 --> 12:03.125
(Scotty)
'So this picks up
right after psycho boy'

12:03.208 --> 12:04.959
'supposedly shot Daniela'

12:11.250 --> 12:14.208
Like they said,
she was alive when they left.

12:14.291 --> 12:16.417
The film was a fake.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.083
Vera tracked down
the lab records.

12:18.166 --> 12:20.375
It was processed in March 1979.

12:20.458 --> 12:22.375
And Jane Doe's trash bag
turned up in May.

12:22.458 --> 12:24.208
Two months after
the film was made.

12:24.291 --> 12:26.458
So maybe these boys
aren't the doers.

12:26.542 --> 12:28.208
Well, Jeffries and Vera
found Daniella's apartment

12:28.291 --> 12:30.083
a half hour ago,
they got CSU with them.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.667
Oh, it could be
a wild-goose chase, Scotty.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.333
The connect to Jane Doe
is looking thin.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.834
(Lilly)
'Want me to give 'em
the heads up, boss?'

12:36.917 --> 12:38.000
Yeah.

12:40.875 --> 12:42.834
Hey, Jeffries.
Looks like this job

12:42.917 --> 12:43.834
might've died on us.

12:43.917 --> 12:45.667
That's not all that died.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.208
We just Luminoled the scene.

12:47.291 --> 12:48.750
It's a bloodbath.

13:00.417 --> 13:03.125
(Jeffries)
'Last known resident in that
basement was a Daniella'

13:03.208 --> 13:04.417
no last name.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.000
Landlord said
she disappeared May 1979.

13:07.083 --> 13:09.166
Same time Jane Doe's
belongings were found.

13:09.250 --> 13:10.834
DNA from the blood
in the floorboards

13:10.917 --> 13:12.834
matches the blood
in the trash bag.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.208
- So Daniella's our Jane Doe.
- Yeah.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.834
Keeps our two
filmmakers
in the mix.

13:17.917 --> 13:19.667
How about this landlord
for the doer?

13:19.750 --> 13:21.583
(Jeffries)
'Guy volunteered
his prints and blood.'

13:21.667 --> 13:22.750
We'll run 'em for a match.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.583
Any shell casings at the scene?

13:24.667 --> 13:25.959
Nah, doer was real careful.

13:26.041 --> 13:27.458
Washed the blood
off the walls pretty good.

13:27.542 --> 13:28.792
I want to drill this landlord

13:28.875 --> 13:31.166
find out where Daniella
came from.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.083
Nowhere. Same place
she disappeared to.

13:33.166 --> 13:35.333
She didn't grow up
in the bus depot.

13:35.417 --> 13:38.208
Check prostitution arrests
around the depot in '79.

13:38.291 --> 13:40.625
Find someone who knew her,
maybe they know her story.

13:40.709 --> 13:41.917
You got it, boss.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.667
Place was never
no more than
storage.

13:48.750 --> 13:51.250
I turned it back
after Daniella
left.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.875
You said Daniella disappeared
some time in mid May?

13:58.959 --> 14:00.750
You recall the exact date?

14:00.834 --> 14:02.959
One day she's here
and next day gone.

14:03.041 --> 14:06.291
'Took most of her stuff so
I figured she'd run off
again.'

14:06.375 --> 14:07.333
She was a runaway?

14:07.417 --> 14:08.875
Hung at the old bus depot.

14:08.959 --> 14:10.750
That's the kinda tenant
I had in those days.

14:10.834 --> 14:13.417
- Know where she came from?
- 'No.'

14:13.500 --> 14:15.583
Hear any gunshots
coming from her apartment ever?

14:15.667 --> 14:18.250
Round here, gunshots
are like sunrise

14:18.333 --> 14:20.667
an everyday sort of thing.

14:20.750 --> 14:22.834
Ever see these kids
hangin' around?

14:25.834 --> 14:28.709
Mm-mm. Daniella
already had a
man.

14:28.792 --> 14:29.959
What do you mean?

14:30.041 --> 14:31.917
Some crazy Latin
who shacked up here.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.041
Always yelling at her like
she'd downed the last taco

14:35.125 --> 14:36.166
or something.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.125
You ever get a look at him?

14:38.208 --> 14:40.959
Heard him,
though,
loud and clear.

14:41.041 --> 14:42.792
Every weekend, like clockwork.

14:56.125 --> 14:58.250
You got someone
staying in there.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.291
You owe more rent.

14:59.375 --> 15:00.458
Nobody's staying.

15:00.542 --> 15:02.333
Just heard Chico going off.

15:02.417 --> 15:04.709
I'm barely getting by.
I can't pay more rent.

15:04.792 --> 15:07.208
Well, then
he ain't staying here.

15:07.291 --> 15:08.375
He'll be out.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.250
By tomorrow.

15:20.291 --> 15:22.125
What was this
boyfriend's name?

15:22.208 --> 15:24.500
Edwin...Eduardo.

15:24.583 --> 15:26.166
I seen Daniella
bring
in mail for him

15:26.250 --> 15:27.667
from time to time.

15:27.750 --> 15:30.583
Mm-hmm. She end up
giving him the boot?

15:30.667 --> 15:33.208
No. Heard him back here
the very next weekend.

15:33.291 --> 15:35.834
Hey, you ever try for
a piece of her Latin ass?

15:35.917 --> 15:38.166
Make up for that rent
she couldn't pay?

15:38.250 --> 15:39.875
You can't blame me for trying.

15:39.959 --> 15:41.875
She was something.

15:41.959 --> 15:44.625
Yeah. A desperate kid.

15:44.709 --> 15:47.667
I wasn't gonna do nothing
to her ain't already been done

15:47.750 --> 15:49.291
a million times before.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.834
(Scotty)
'He's a real Romeo, that
one.'

15:57.750 --> 16:00.834
Looks like magazine pictures
taped up on the wall.

16:00.917 --> 16:02.083
Wonder who put 'em up?

16:02.959 --> 16:06.375
Romeo sure didn't. Daniella?

16:06.458 --> 16:07.959
No windows in this place.

16:08.041 --> 16:10.125
Gotta look at something.

16:10.208 --> 16:11.792
were

16:22.083 --> 16:23.208
I was lucky.

16:23.291 --> 16:25.625
Got out while
I still had my teeth.

16:25.709 --> 16:27.166
Now I'm helping
other working girls

16:27.250 --> 16:29.875
do the same, one soul at a time.

16:29.959 --> 16:31.375
According to arrest records

16:31.458 --> 16:34.750
you worked the bus depot
back in '79.

16:34.834 --> 16:36.709
Did you know a
girl
named Daniella?

16:36.792 --> 16:39.333
Daniella? Yeah.

16:39.417 --> 16:41.208
Have any idea
where she came from?

16:41.291 --> 16:42.917
Not from here.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.750
Daniella was..

16:44.834 --> 16:46.583
She was a shining star.

16:46.667 --> 16:47.875
Didn't belong on the streets?

16:47.959 --> 16:50.083
Nobody belongs there, baby.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.375
She's dead, isn't she?

16:54.458 --> 16:57.166
We think she was
murdered in '79.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.000
I told myself she got out
when she stopped coming around.

17:01.041 --> 17:02.834
Always said she would.

17:04.333 --> 17:07.375
Funny how things work.

17:07.458 --> 17:09.333
So, what else can an old whore

17:09.417 --> 17:11.542
do for you
fine-looking gentlemen?

17:11.625 --> 17:13.709
You ever see these
two around the depot?

17:14.959 --> 17:17.500
Mmm. Looks like every
other white boy trolling

17:17.583 --> 17:20.375
around for colored tail
back then.

17:20.458 --> 17:22.417
Daniella never
gave none of that up.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.917
So she wasn't hooking at all?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.709
Uh-uh, baby. No way.

17:32.667 --> 17:34.291
Get some bread for this ring

17:34.375 --> 17:37.291
get that jive turkey
landlord off my back.

17:37.375 --> 17:39.458
- Who's that?
- You high again, Marquette?

17:39.542 --> 17:41.166
I told you about him.

17:41.250 --> 17:43.208
Not him. Him..

17:43.291 --> 17:45.291
Edwin Castillo.

17:46.709 --> 17:47.917
Nobody.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.625
He your man?

17:50.709 --> 17:54.959
Oh, you can tell
Marquette, baby
girl.

17:55.041 --> 17:57.291
Some cat from a long time ago.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.458
'From home?'

18:00.041 --> 18:01.333
He follow you here?

18:03.041 --> 18:05.333
He follows me everywhere.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.667
He gonna be mad
you selling his
ring?

18:09.333 --> 18:10.709
He ain't the real thing.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.375
Know what you mean, baby girl.

18:23.166 --> 18:25.875
Guess old Edwin
didn't scratch her itch.

18:25.959 --> 18:28.500
Did you ever meet
him?
This Edwin?

18:28.583 --> 18:29.959
Daniella was real secretive-like

18:30.041 --> 18:31.834
with them guys in her life.

18:31.917 --> 18:33.000
What guys?

18:33.083 --> 18:35.291
This one and, and that other one

18:35.375 --> 18:37.458
always picking her up
from the depot.

18:37.542 --> 18:39.709
"Red Camaro Kid,"
what I called him.

18:39.792 --> 18:42.583
Never saw his face,
just that fine-looking ride.

18:42.667 --> 18:44.250
I thought you said
she wasn't hooking.

18:44.333 --> 18:47.333
Well, hooking ain't what
that was about, baby.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.333
Shoulda seen Daniella's face
when he'd drive up.

18:50.417 --> 18:52.000
Looked like she
was falling in love

18:52.083 --> 18:55.125
for the first time, every time.

18:55.208 --> 18:58.417
(Lilly)
'Daniella had a live-in
boyfriend, Latino guy'

18:58.500 --> 19:00.333
and this Camaro
Kid on the side.

19:00.417 --> 19:03.458
So we're thinking a love
triangle got her killed?

19:03.542 --> 19:04.667
One theory.

19:04.750 --> 19:06.542
You ran Boyfriend's name
through AutoTrack?

19:06.625 --> 19:09.709
No hits. Edwin Castillo
Edward, Eduardo.

19:09.792 --> 19:11.208
Guy ain't in the state of PA.

19:11.291 --> 19:13.166
Maybe loverboy
him,

19:14.959 --> 19:16.208
Hey. What've you got?

19:16.291 --> 19:18.625
1979 Camaro registrations..

19:18.709 --> 19:20.625
and you'll never
guess who owned one.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.875
Meet the Camaro Kid.

19:32.417 --> 19:34.834
Me and her had a thing. So what?

19:34.917 --> 19:37.875
A thing? We hear
Daniella
was head over heels.

19:37.959 --> 19:40.333
One-way-street kinda thing?

19:40.417 --> 19:42.333
I was a kid. So shoot me.

19:42.417 --> 19:45.000
You lie to us once, makes
me
think you'll do it again.

19:46.667 --> 19:49.417
It isn't the kind of thing
that you tell the world.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.750
We ain't the world.

19:50.834 --> 19:52.208
We're Homicide.

19:55.875 --> 19:59.875
After that night, I went back,
to say I was sorry.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.208
Shoot you in the
head,
you come near me.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.333
I didn't know he was
gonna do that. I'm sorry.

20:17.709 --> 20:19.333
The Empire State Building.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.125
What?

20:22.208 --> 20:24.625
It's on your wall.

20:24.709 --> 20:26.250
And the Eiffel Tower
and the Leaning Tower

20:26.333 --> 20:27.709
of what do you call it?

20:27.792 --> 20:28.959
Pisa.

20:29.041 --> 20:30.750
Yeah, that.

20:30.834 --> 20:33.375
I'm gonna see
those
places one day.

20:33.458 --> 20:36.500
Yeah, well...good for you.

20:36.583 --> 20:39.792
So are you. That's why
you
put 'em up on your wall.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.417
So what?

20:47.375 --> 20:48.709
I'm sorry about last night.

20:53.834 --> 20:55.041
Okay.

21:00.792 --> 21:02.083
New York's only a few hours away

21:02.166 --> 21:05.250
so if you're not...busy,
maybe..

21:05.333 --> 21:07.083
...sometime..

21:07.166 --> 21:08.834
'I mean, only if you want to.'

21:10.083 --> 21:11.333
'We can..'

21:11.417 --> 21:12.834
Go see the Eiffel Tower
or something.

21:14.083 --> 21:17.041
You mean
the Empire State Building.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.333
Yeah, that.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.041
Okay.

21:24.542 --> 21:25.834
Okay.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.542
And that's how it started.

21:29.625 --> 21:31.500
How long did you see her for?

21:31.583 --> 21:33.250
Two weeks and then it was over.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.750
My pops would have
killed me if he found out

21:34.834 --> 21:36.834
I was dating
a Puerto Rican girl.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.834
Hmm, class act, your pops.

21:38.917 --> 21:40.375
You don't know my pops.

21:42.625 --> 21:44.709
I was a Wonder Bread kid
from the suburbs.

21:44.792 --> 21:46.041
It never could have worked.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.333
Ever meet Daniella's boyfriend

21:47.417 --> 21:48.709
the guy she lived with?

21:48.792 --> 21:51.375
She never told me about a guy.

21:51.458 --> 21:54.709
You ever take her to see
the Empire State
Building?

21:54.792 --> 21:58.583
Yeah. It seemed like her home
had bad memories for her.

21:58.667 --> 22:00.375
Daniella was from New York?

22:00.458 --> 22:02.041
Across the river. Jersey City.

22:02.125 --> 22:04.083
Why'd home have
bad memories for her?

22:06.125 --> 22:07.458
I never asked.

22:08.917 --> 22:10.166
Hm.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.917
No missing persons
report in Jersey

22:16.000 --> 22:18.208
matching Daniella's description.

22:18.291 --> 22:20.417
How about the boyfriend?
You AutoTrack him in Jersey?

22:20.500 --> 22:21.542
Looking.

22:21.625 --> 22:23.250
'My bets are on him
for the doer.'

22:23.333 --> 22:26.959
Goes from yelling to a more
direct kind of communication.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.917
My bet's on lover boy Chris.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.667
''Cause he lied?'

22:30.750 --> 22:32.667
'Cause what gets
you
in the end..

22:32.750 --> 22:34.417
...is what you love.

22:34.500 --> 22:35.667
Maybe.

22:35.750 --> 22:38.375
Found the
boyfriend.
Edwin Castillo.

22:38.458 --> 22:42.125
1202 Fifth Street, Jersey City..

22:42.208 --> 22:43.250
New Jersey.

22:57.625 --> 22:58.625
<i>Si?</i>

22:58.709 --> 23:01.333
Detective Rush,
Philadelphia Homicide.

23:01.417 --> 23:04.125
It's about Edwin Castillo.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.375
My baby's dead?

23:05.458 --> 23:08.333
That's not why we're here.

23:08.417 --> 23:09.792
Then where is he?

23:09.875 --> 23:11.458
That's what
we wanted to ask you.

23:13.333 --> 23:15.834
I haven't seen
Edwin
in 25 years.

23:17.291 --> 23:20.625
He ran real wild as a boy.

23:20.709 --> 23:22.375
We fought.

23:22.458 --> 23:25.834
But I always thought
he'd come home one day.

23:25.917 --> 23:28.458
Well, we need to find him,
Ms. Castillo.

23:28.542 --> 23:29.542
Why?

23:29.625 --> 23:31.417
We think he was involved
with this girl.

23:32.875 --> 23:34.041
Do you recognize her?

23:41.917 --> 23:44.834
Ms. Castillo,
you know this girl?

23:44.917 --> 23:46.000
Girl..

23:47.250 --> 23:48.583
That's my son.

23:48.667 --> 23:50.041
That's Edwin.

24:03.333 --> 24:05.959
So, she was a he?

24:06.041 --> 24:07.333
Right.

24:07.417 --> 24:09.333
That's impossible.
Look at her.

24:09.417 --> 24:10.750
You mean him.

24:10.834 --> 24:12.166
Makes motive
that much stronger.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.583
For Chris.

24:13.667 --> 24:15.834
Fall in love with a girl
and finding out she's a guy.

24:15.917 --> 24:17.291
Or his pal John.

24:17.375 --> 24:19.000
He got a piece of that, too.

24:19.083 --> 24:21.291
Oh, I want to be
there
for that interview.

24:23.959 --> 24:25.375
'"Love, Daniela."'

24:25.458 --> 24:28.041
Even as a kid, he was
signing his name as a girl.

24:28.125 --> 24:29.375
Mom give you these?

24:29.458 --> 24:31.375
And she and Edwin would
fight day and night

24:31.458 --> 24:33.542
about him wearing
make-up, jewelry..

24:33.625 --> 24:35.709
He ran away after one
too many screaming matches.

24:35.792 --> 24:37.625
The fights continued
over the phone.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.041
The arguing the landlord heard.

24:39.125 --> 24:40.208
Yep.

24:40.291 --> 24:42.750
Yeah, Mom always figured
Daniela would, uh

24:42.834 --> 24:44.125
grow out of it.

24:44.208 --> 24:45.792
You mean Edwin.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.208
Whatever.

24:47.291 --> 24:49.250
Will, you remember Jay Lambert

24:49.333 --> 24:51.333
the firearms
instructor
at the Academy?

24:51.417 --> 24:53.959
Uhh, goes by Jillian now.

24:54.041 --> 24:55.333
Wha...the perm?

24:56.333 --> 24:57.667
The perm was a man?

24:57.750 --> 25:00.709
- 'Yes, sir.'
- Your kind of girl, Vera.

25:00.792 --> 25:01.875
She's better looking.

25:15.542 --> 25:18.208
We gotta talk
more about Daniela, John.

25:18.291 --> 25:19.583
And what you got off of her.

25:19.667 --> 25:21.583
She was a talented girl.

25:21.667 --> 25:23.792
Except she was a guy.

25:23.875 --> 25:25.500
And I'm the Queen of England.

25:25.583 --> 25:26.709
Well, Your Highness..

25:30.166 --> 25:32.959
Meet Edwin.

25:33.041 --> 25:34.542
AKA..

25:35.417 --> 25:36.458
Daniela.

25:38.417 --> 25:40.417
That isn't possible.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.166
Kind of explains her talent
on your joystick, huh?

25:44.417 --> 25:45.458
So..

25:46.875 --> 25:49.125
Cassie was right.

25:49.208 --> 25:50.291
Who's Cassie?

25:51.458 --> 25:53.125
Hey.

25:53.208 --> 25:54.291
Who's Cassie?

25:54.375 --> 25:56.959
This girl I knew in high school.

25:57.041 --> 25:58.917
She knew something
was up with that..

26:04.834 --> 26:07.083
Where you been at, Chris?

26:07.166 --> 26:10.834
For months I don't see you.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.792
You're a bummer, baby.

26:12.875 --> 26:13.875
I've been busy.

26:13.959 --> 26:16.166
Yeah, he's got some squeeze.

26:16.250 --> 26:18.500
- Who?
- She isn't some squeeze.

26:18.583 --> 26:19.792
Who is she?

26:22.959 --> 26:25.125
You taking her to prom?

26:25.208 --> 26:28.041
Hey-hey check
out our flick, Cass.

26:28.125 --> 26:30.709
You could've been a star.

26:30.792 --> 26:32.959
Is this that pervert movie
you guys did?

26:33.041 --> 26:34.500
I gotta split.

26:34.583 --> 26:36.041
Chrissie, baby,
where you going?

26:45.250 --> 26:46.667
Who is that?

26:46.750 --> 26:50.208
Some outta sight dy-no-mite
hooker chica.

26:50.291 --> 26:52.709
She looks like
your blow up doll.

26:52.792 --> 26:54.166
Shut up, Cass.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.875
There's something
funny about her.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.792
Nothing's funny about her.

27:16.291 --> 27:18.750
So your friend Cassie knew?

27:20.291 --> 27:21.500
She was always talking.

27:22.834 --> 27:24.750
But I guess she must've, yeah.

27:24.834 --> 27:26.542
Did Chris know?

27:26.625 --> 27:28.625
Go ask him your own damn self.

27:29.792 --> 27:31.834
And for the record..

27:31.917 --> 27:36.125
I made that up about...you know.

27:36.208 --> 27:38.959
I never touched that.

27:39.041 --> 27:40.792
You can't have it
both ways, John.

27:51.542 --> 27:52.750
(Lilly)
<i>'Lie twice.'</i>

27:54.667 --> 27:57.166
Three time's the charm.

27:57.250 --> 27:58.250
I didn't lie.

27:58.333 --> 27:59.750
You weren't with Daniela
for two weeks.

27:59.834 --> 28:03.333
It was a lot longer than that.

28:03.417 --> 28:05.083
And then you found out
the truth.

28:05.166 --> 28:06.458
I didn't kill her.

28:06.542 --> 28:07.750
You mean him.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.417
Your friend Cassie
was figuring it out.

28:12.500 --> 28:13.750
Maybe everyone else would, too.

28:13.834 --> 28:15.709
So putting a bullet
in Daniela's head

28:15.792 --> 28:16.834
was the only way out.

28:16.917 --> 28:18.792
It only happens once.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.375
You only get one chance.

28:23.458 --> 28:25.792
You don't walk
away
when it happens.

28:27.583 --> 28:29.542
When what happens?

28:29.625 --> 28:32.291
When you find the one you've
been looking for all along.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.291
It didn't matter what she was.

28:37.375 --> 28:39.166
She was my chance.

28:42.166 --> 28:44.000
(Daniela)
'You can do it. Oh, yeah.'

28:44.083 --> 28:45.166
'And shake.'

28:47.875 --> 28:49.125
Let me show you one. Ready?

28:49.208 --> 28:52.792
- Yeah.
- One, two, and turn.

28:52.875 --> 28:53.959
And turn.

28:56.709 --> 28:59.333
Shake that groove thing,
White boy.

29:07.542 --> 29:08.959
'I love this song.'

29:32.959 --> 29:34.375
Aren't we supposed
to be doing this

29:34.458 --> 29:35.917
after the prom, papi?

29:37.417 --> 29:38.542
You gonna come with me?

29:45.750 --> 29:47.208
You don't want to,
that's cool.

29:47.291 --> 29:49.083
It ain't that.

29:49.166 --> 29:51.333
Come here then.

29:51.417 --> 29:53.291
You don't see me.

29:56.625 --> 29:58.709
I want the world to see me.

30:01.083 --> 30:02.542
For who I really am.

30:09.333 --> 30:12.166
Stop. Please.

30:19.291 --> 30:20.208
I see you.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.500
Who you really are.
I see, Daniela.

30:45.125 --> 30:46.792
Dumb kid.

30:46.875 --> 30:49.875
Thought taking her to a
stupid
dance would change
anything.

30:53.333 --> 30:54.625
She didn't even come.

30:57.166 --> 30:58.166
Why not?

31:02.834 --> 31:04.041
He clammed up.

31:04.125 --> 31:06.250
Won't say why Daniela
was a no-show at the prom.

31:06.333 --> 31:09.667
Sounds like they got past
the hard part before the prom.

31:09.750 --> 31:12.125
So what else
could've caused a rift?

31:12.208 --> 31:13.959
John say when prom night was?

31:14.041 --> 31:15.583
May 12th.

31:15.667 --> 31:17.625
Around the same time
Daniela disappeared.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.917
So maybe something happened
that night made her disappear.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.041
(Lilly)
'Let's head out.'

31:22.125 --> 31:23.083
Where we going?

31:23.166 --> 31:24.125
Find the girl dying to be

31:24.208 --> 31:25.542
Chris's prom squeeze.

31:27.291 --> 31:29.583
Like I remember
high school prom.

31:29.667 --> 31:30.959
Please.

31:31.041 --> 31:32.625
Beats me who he brung.

31:35.542 --> 31:37.917
So you don't remember Chris?

31:38.000 --> 31:39.291
Just barely.

31:39.375 --> 31:42.792
It's too bad 'cause
he remembers you, Cassie.

31:42.875 --> 31:44.125
Wonders what happened to you

31:44.208 --> 31:46.000
where you ended up.

31:48.458 --> 31:51.000
I got pregnant.
That's where.

31:53.500 --> 31:55.625
Good-looking guy.

31:55.709 --> 31:57.875
I would've been
head
over heels myself.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.250
He barely knew I was alive.

32:01.333 --> 32:03.208
Wanted him to bring you
to the prom, huh?

32:05.125 --> 32:08.375
Would've changed
my life if he did.

32:08.458 --> 32:09.625
But he didn't.

32:12.083 --> 32:13.709
You remember this girl, Cassie?

32:14.709 --> 32:15.959
Mm-hmm.

32:16.041 --> 32:18.166
From that movie they made.

32:18.250 --> 32:19.917
Chris was gonna bring her.

32:23.166 --> 32:24.667
So that's who he meant.

32:24.750 --> 32:27.166
When he showed up
like that at the prom.

32:27.250 --> 32:30.166
How'd he show up?

32:30.250 --> 32:31.458
He was all beat up.

33:01.417 --> 33:02.458
Chris!

33:03.500 --> 33:04.959
Chris. Hey.

33:06.041 --> 33:08.375
What happened to you? Baby..

33:11.041 --> 33:12.709
He hit you again, didn't he?

33:12.792 --> 33:13.792
And her.

33:13.875 --> 33:16.000
Who? Your date?

33:18.750 --> 33:19.875
Oh..

33:19.959 --> 33:22.291
Chrissie, shh...baby.

33:22.375 --> 33:25.041
Hey...I'm here for you.

33:25.125 --> 33:26.875
I've always been here for you.

33:28.667 --> 33:30.000
Get off of me, Cassie.

33:33.625 --> 33:35.083
He made her go away.

33:37.625 --> 33:39.041
He made her go forever.

33:44.208 --> 33:45.875
(Scotty)
'Who was he talking about?'

33:45.959 --> 33:47.542
Who hit him, Cassie?

33:47.625 --> 33:50.667
The one person Chris
could never face up to.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.125
His pops.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.375
Gave the kid a real
shiner
the night of his prom.

34:09.458 --> 34:13.083
Made Daniela go away
that night...forever.

34:13.166 --> 34:15.917
No wonder he hasn't talked
to you in 25 years.

34:17.166 --> 34:19.417
Just wanted what
was best for my
son.

34:19.500 --> 34:21.792
- You'd do the same.
- What? Kill a girl?

34:23.458 --> 34:27.166
I never touched...Daniela.

34:27.250 --> 34:30.166
So you knew what she was.

34:30.250 --> 34:32.667
Not at first.

34:32.750 --> 34:35.583
Just didn't want my son
messin' with some
runaway.

34:35.667 --> 34:37.041
Gave him a piece of my mind.

34:37.125 --> 34:38.750
With your fists.

34:38.834 --> 34:40.583
He had it comin'.
Wouldn't heed me.

34:40.667 --> 34:42.542
So how'd you find out..

34:42.625 --> 34:44.166
...what Daniela was?

34:47.583 --> 34:50.792
The night of that...dance.

34:50.875 --> 34:54.166
I followed Christopher.

34:54.250 --> 34:55.667
To a part of town he..

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
...he never
shoulda
set foot in...

35:08.792 --> 35:10.583
'What're you doin', Chris?'

35:10.667 --> 35:11.792
Hmm?

35:11.875 --> 35:12.917
Dad..

35:15.041 --> 35:16.417
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from
her!

35:17.750 --> 35:20.166
Don't you touch him...!

35:27.000 --> 35:28.333
What the hell!

35:31.458 --> 35:32.542
It's a guy!

35:34.959 --> 35:36.083
This thing is a guy?

35:38.834 --> 35:40.959
You did it with a man,
Christopher?

35:41.041 --> 35:42.041
What?

35:42.125 --> 35:44.000
With a faggot?

35:44.083 --> 35:45.458
Don't say that.

35:45.542 --> 35:47.417
You turned fag?

35:47.500 --> 35:50.625
Chris...tell him.

35:50.709 --> 35:52.125
Dad, please..

35:52.208 --> 35:53.917
Tell me what you did
with that thing.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.041
Tell him, Chris!

35:55.125 --> 35:56.834
You tell me..

35:56.917 --> 35:59.333
...what you did!

36:02.250 --> 36:03.291
Nothin'.

36:05.125 --> 36:06.583
I didn't do nothin' with him.

36:19.166 --> 36:20.834
You stay away from us.

36:20.917 --> 36:21.959
Let's go.

36:23.625 --> 36:24.667
Wait!

36:31.166 --> 36:33.417
Take your trash outta here.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.041
Let's go!

36:50.041 --> 36:51.917
Chris went to the prom
that night..

36:53.417 --> 36:54.792
...like a normal boy.

36:58.625 --> 37:00.333
End of her. End of story.

37:03.834 --> 37:07.792
Chris gave Daniela
a rose corsage?

37:11.041 --> 37:12.542
But he took it back.

37:19.500 --> 37:20.625
(Lilly)
'Rose petals..'

37:21.583 --> 37:23.291
From Daniela's corsage.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.000
(Scotty)
'The one you gave
her prom night.'

37:26.333 --> 37:27.375
I got nothing to say to you.

37:27.458 --> 37:29.583
But then you took it back.

37:29.667 --> 37:30.917
The corsage.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.625
She made you.

37:32.709 --> 37:36.041
So why were the petals found
with Daniela's bloody clothes?

37:36.125 --> 37:38.417
Unless you went back.

37:40.166 --> 37:43.375
All she wanted was for the
world
to see her as a girl.

37:43.458 --> 37:44.375
Like you did.

37:44.458 --> 37:46.000
Until your pops found out.

37:46.083 --> 37:48.250
And then you were ashamed
of her and hid her things

37:48.333 --> 37:50.792
'so no one would know what
she was, and tossed her away'

37:50.875 --> 37:52.041
like a piece of trash.

37:52.125 --> 37:53.500
- No.
- Where'd you put her, Chris?

37:55.458 --> 37:57.417
Daniela was your chance.

37:58.583 --> 38:00.041
'And you don't
walk away from that.'

38:00.125 --> 38:03.208
'Cause maybe
it's the only one we ever
get.

38:03.291 --> 38:06.458
Your father made you walk
away once, Chris.

38:06.542 --> 38:07.750
Don't do it again.

38:09.750 --> 38:11.291
But I already did.

38:13.083 --> 38:14.458
I just walked away.

39:17.625 --> 39:18.583
Daniela!

39:22.333 --> 39:23.625
Daniela!

39:25.875 --> 39:26.875
Daniela?

39:31.291 --> 39:32.500
'Daniela..'

39:46.792 --> 39:48.250
I came back, see?

39:51.542 --> 39:54.583
I came back for you, Daniela.

39:54.667 --> 39:55.917
I came back.
