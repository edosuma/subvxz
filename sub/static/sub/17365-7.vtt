WEBVTT

00:10.052 --> 00:15.008
Tonight,
the stupidest car in the world.

00:15.043 --> 00:17.973
A Vauxhall you might actually like.

00:18.008 --> 00:21.040
And who has won what in
the Top Gear awards ceremony?

00:27.040 --> 00:29.965
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:30.000 --> 00:34.004
Hello everybody!
Welcome, and a happy new year.

00:34.039 --> 00:36.013
Happy new year to everybody.

00:36.048 --> 00:41.040
Now, like many of you here, I suffer from
insomnia. I've tried everything over the years.

00:41.075 --> 00:46.056
I've tried eating lettuce, counting
sheep, I even resorted last night

00:46.091 --> 00:48.057
to James May's new talking book. LAUGHTER

00:48.092 --> 00:52.092
That didn't work either.
Now, Richard Hammond seems to have

00:52.127 --> 00:56.088
accidentally uncovered
what might be a cure.

01:01.016 --> 01:03.056
This is a Lexus.

01:05.007 --> 01:08.528
It's called the RX 450h,
and it's everything you'd expect

01:08.563 --> 01:12.048
from what Alan Partridge called
the Japanese Mercedes.

01:15.040 --> 01:20.552
It's quiet, it's well-made, it's got a
lentil matic hybrid engine, all very clever.

01:20.587 --> 01:26.064
All things you'd expect from a car company
that has won many awards over the years.

01:26.099 --> 01:31.079
Neatest panel gap consistency in
the executive saloon sector award.

01:31.114 --> 01:36.060
And the coveted, that's a nice paint
finish award. Three years running.

01:37.072 --> 01:43.054
I think you're getting the picture.
All Lexuses are beautifully made

01:43.089 --> 01:49.036
and impeccably engineered to achieve
unmatched levels of dullness.

01:50.024 --> 01:52.001
So when they announced recently,

01:52.036 --> 01:55.092
"We've made a sports car,"
oh, how we laughed in the office!

01:57.044 --> 02:00.080
Right up until the moment we saw it.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:09.096 --> 02:12.080
Yeah... Egg on face.

02:13.072 --> 02:20.068
Foot in mouth. Humble pie,
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

02:28.088 --> 02:30.041
It's called the LFA.

02:30.076 --> 02:34.586
Despite being a Lexus, it
doesn't have many Lexussy features.

02:34.621 --> 02:39.061
There's no eat your greens
hybrid hiding under the bonnet.

02:39.096 --> 02:44.064
There's no golf clubs hiding in
the boot. It's even got a spoiler.

02:44.099 --> 02:46.036
It's the real deal.

02:48.076 --> 02:52.056
And if you're still not convinced
that this thing is a supercar,

02:52.091 --> 02:55.060
then let me give you
some nerdy-licious numbers.

02:56.064 --> 03:00.009
552 horse power.

03:00.044 --> 03:04.084
Same as the Gallardo.
0 to 60, 3.7 seconds.

03:04.119 --> 03:07.025
Same as a Ferrari 599.

03:07.060 --> 03:13.004
Top speed, 202 mph. That's
faster than an Aston Martin DBS.

03:14.020 --> 03:20.024
OK, I think what I need to do here
is just find out how that works.

03:20.059 --> 03:22.004
Stop.

03:22.076 --> 03:24.064
Sport.

03:24.099 --> 03:25.591
Ooh, yeah!

03:25.626 --> 03:27.853
That I like.

03:27.888 --> 03:29.950
ENGINE REVS

03:29.985 --> 03:32.012
And go!

03:38.052 --> 03:42.032
Woah... that's... explosive!

03:43.004 --> 03:45.028
It's immediate.

03:47.052 --> 03:52.008
There's no waiting for a second.
It is just stop, wham, going!

03:55.020 --> 03:56.028
150.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.008
170.

04:04.064 --> 04:07.036
That's really quite a fast car.

04:09.004 --> 04:13.080
Now, this being a Lexus, you might
expected to be not just a supercar,

04:13.115 --> 04:18.024
but a supercar full of
immense attention to detail.

04:18.059 --> 04:20.009
You'd be right.

04:20.043 --> 04:25.040
4.8 litre V10, and yet somehow the
Lexus boffins have managed to make it

04:25.075 --> 04:28.547
only the size of a V8, and as light
as a V6.

04:28.582 --> 04:31.803
But that's not the most
amazing thing about it.

04:31.838 --> 04:35.024
No, the most amazing
thing is the way it revs.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.997
The engine is so lively,

04:40.032 --> 04:44.044
they've had to fit this computer
game style virtual rev counter.

04:47.032 --> 04:50.062
Because a normal analogue rev counter
can't keep pace

04:50.097 --> 04:53.092
with how quickly
this thing gains and loses revs.

04:57.036 --> 05:00.981
And then there's the beautifully
nerdy flappy paddle gear change.

05:01.016 --> 05:07.048
The paddle to change up is lighter to
use than the paddle to change down.

05:07.083 --> 05:10.016
Just so you know you're
going in the right direction.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.041
HE LAUGHS

05:11.076 --> 05:16.028
Amazing stuff from a company that
has never built a supercar before.

05:21.020 --> 05:24.016
Which is why they took their
sweet time over this one.

05:24.051 --> 05:26.049
Nine years in fact.

05:26.084 --> 05:29.005
At first, the body
was made of aluminium.

05:29.040 --> 05:32.017
Then, after years of work,
it was deemed too heavy,

05:32.052 --> 05:38.000
so it was scrapped and they began
all over again, using carbon fibre.

05:38.035 --> 05:41.045
Lightness was an obsession.

05:41.080 --> 05:47.000
The steering wheel, for example,
is also made of carbon fibre.

05:47.035 --> 05:51.549
The pedals are milled from a single
piece of aluminium.

05:51.584 --> 05:56.064
And even the complex Lexus
stereo has been a on the Atkins.

05:59.036 --> 06:01.993
Geekiness is everywhere here.

06:02.028 --> 06:05.000
These mirrors are specially
shaped so they

06:05.035 --> 06:06.037
funnel air
into these air intakes.

06:06.072 --> 06:09.038
The designers were so obsessed with
good handling,

06:09.073 --> 06:11.969
that even the water bottle for the
windscreen washers

06:12.004 --> 06:15.508
is buried somewhere deep down there,
next to the petrol tank, to try and

06:15.543 --> 06:19.012
keep as much of the weight as low as
possible and inside the wheelbase.

06:19.047 --> 06:20.997
Just like an F1 car.

06:21.032 --> 06:22.965
Don't be fooled by this gap.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.008
That's not shoddy build quality,
that's a specially designed intake.

06:29.008 --> 06:34.076
So, it's definitely a Lexus, and it
definitely looks like a supercar.

06:34.111 --> 06:38.020
The question is,
does it feel like one?

06:41.076 --> 06:42.578
It's lively...

06:42.613 --> 06:44.080
TYRES SCREECH

06:45.072 --> 06:50.056
The brakes are ferocious. After caning it
around this track, no sign of getting tired.

06:55.060 --> 06:59.032
There's an initial lead from the
front end. It's quite a soft feeling.

07:00.084 --> 07:01.977
The thing just wallows in,

07:02.012 --> 07:04.032
and you can give it a boot-full with
the rear end.

07:06.044 --> 07:07.096
In!

07:10.056 --> 07:11.532
HE LAUGHS

07:11.567 --> 07:13.008
TYRES SCREECH

07:13.043 --> 07:13.993
Oh, no.

07:14.028 --> 07:15.068
TYRES SCREECH

07:16.016 --> 07:17.068
Oh, God.

07:20.008 --> 07:25.064
Get it wrong and it takes absolutely
no prisoners. It just spits you out.

07:26.040 --> 07:29.020
Get it right though, and you'll be
laughing.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.084
Oh, yes! There you go!

07:49.044 --> 07:50.076
HE LAUGHS

07:58.076 --> 08:03.080
There we are. What a turn-up
from the librarian of the car world.

08:03.115 --> 08:06.008
Which brings me to the
obvious question...

08:06.043 --> 08:09.008
Would one buy one?

08:11.076 --> 08:14.044
That all depends how much it costs.

08:14.079 --> 08:16.965
L50,000, oh, yes!

08:17.000 --> 08:23.036
L100,000, yeah. L150,000? Well, it's
expensive, but it'll be exclusive.

08:23.071 --> 08:29.060
As it happens, the LFA
doesn't cost L150,000. No.

08:29.095 --> 08:33.032
The LFA costs L340,000.

08:37.032 --> 08:42.558
That's 130,000 more
than a Ferrari 599.

08:42.592 --> 08:46.822
For a car
that's no faster than a 599.

08:46.857 --> 08:51.017
And you know what?
Even at that price,

08:51.052 --> 08:54.096
Lexus won't make
any money on each one they sell.

09:00.020 --> 09:03.049
What this car is,
is an engineer's wet dream.

09:03.084 --> 09:07.096
It's a brilliant creation,
and praise the Lord it exists.

09:07.131 --> 09:12.076
But price wise,
it's on a different planet.

09:12.111 --> 09:15.009
And there's another slight issue.

09:15.044 --> 09:19.032
At the end of the day, and here
it is, the actual end of the day,

09:19.067 --> 09:21.555
yes, I'm in the Lexus. Oh, God.

09:21.590 --> 09:24.009
I can never get away from that.

09:24.044 --> 09:29.072
"Will the owner of a
L340,000 LEXUS move it?"

09:29.107 --> 09:31.099
That's me. Sorry.

09:31.134 --> 09:33.057
It just doesn't...

09:33.092 --> 09:36.028
It's a Lexus. It just is.

09:41.088 --> 09:43.977
APPLAUSE

09:44.012 --> 09:49.068
I'm baffled. I'm more baffled than
I've ever been.

09:49.103 --> 09:54.033
Hammond, does this car,
does it do 1158 mph?

09:54.068 --> 10:00.008
Yes. Really? No. So, it isn't sixtimes faster than a Nissan GTR?

10:00.043 --> 10:01.985
No. But it costs six times more?

10:02.020 --> 10:05.028
Yeah, it does. Why? Well, it's made
of exotic materials.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.549
It needs to be!
It needs to be made out of myrrh!

10:07.584 --> 10:10.001
Is this windscreen wipermade out of saffron? No.

10:10.036 --> 10:15.036
But there's a lot of carbon fibre.
Hammond, my bog seat at homeis made out of carbon fibre.

10:15.071 --> 10:18.045
It didn't cost 340,000 quid.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.997
Honestly, I just don't
understand this car.

10:21.032 --> 10:25.004
Hopefully, our tame racing driver
will be able to make sense of it.

10:25.039 --> 10:26.997
Some say

10:27.032 --> 10:31.096
that he has to take his shoes off
with an Allen key.

10:33.060 --> 10:38.040
And that his new year's resolution
is to eat fewer mice.

10:39.092 --> 10:43.013
All we know is,
he's called The Stig.

10:43.048 --> 10:46.044
And he's off!
It's wet out there, yet again.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.053
Thank you, Copenhagen!

10:48.088 --> 10:53.048
Let's see how the confusing and
expensive Lexus copes in these conditions.

10:53.083 --> 10:54.041
Here he comes...

10:54.076 --> 10:58.028
Look at that, through the first
corner. Rocking up a bit there.

10:58.063 --> 11:00.004
A little bit of
over steer on the way out.

11:00.039 --> 11:03.016
CHAS AND DAVE SONG PLAYS

11:05.008 --> 11:07.061
Stig, still enjoying a cockney
knees-up,

11:07.096 --> 11:11.040
which is strange because
his knees are on his face.

11:11.075 --> 11:13.581
There's Chicago, a
little bit more over steer.

11:13.616 --> 11:16.344
How is it going to cope
on a moist hammerhead?

11:16.379 --> 11:19.072
Will that
clever weight distribution help?

11:19.107 --> 11:22.057
Running a bit wide, a bit slithery.

11:22.092 --> 11:27.048
You can hear he's having to use the throttle
very gingerly as he gets out of there.

11:33.060 --> 11:38.000
Right, now he can
really mash his paw down.

11:39.052 --> 11:42.029
This thing sounds like
an old F1 car.

11:42.064 --> 11:46.064
Let's hope it's not using know-how from
the Toyota team, or it'll be rubbish.

11:46.099 --> 11:50.083
Two corners left, spearing
into the second to last one.

11:50.118 --> 11:54.068
Just a flash of corrective lock.
Gambon, that's clean.

11:54.103 --> 11:56.072
And across the line.

12:01.060 --> 12:03.025
Do you have the time? I do.

12:03.060 --> 12:06.057
It did it in 1:22.8,
which puts it there.

12:06.092 --> 12:10.088
But critically, I've got to write
on there that it's wet, very wet.

12:10.123 --> 12:13.045
That's the fastest wet lapwe've ever had. By a long way.

12:13.080 --> 12:18.064
That next one is Lambo Gallardo.
The Gallardo, there. Look at that!

12:18.099 --> 12:22.060
Three seconds a lap faster
for three times the price!

12:22.095 --> 12:24.009
It's a bargain!

12:24.044 --> 12:27.068
At the beginning of every year,
the BBC gives us a big lump of money

12:27.103 --> 12:30.555
and tells us to go away
and make 14 programmes.

12:30.590 --> 12:34.008
What we do is we divide that
lump of money by 14,

12:34.043 --> 12:37.000
and that gives us
the budget for every show.

12:37.035 --> 12:38.997
It's simple!
Unfortunately, and I don't

12:39.032 --> 12:42.076
know how this happened, we've
made a complete Horlicks of it.

12:42.111 --> 12:45.033
Which meant that when we got
to make this show, we had,

12:45.068 --> 12:49.028
and I'm not joking, I'm not making
this up, almost no money at all.

12:49.063 --> 12:53.033
No. And you didn't actually thehelp with your Lexus film? Why?

12:53.068 --> 12:57.084
It had a space ship in it. It wasn't actually there
when I filmed it. Was it?

12:57.119 --> 13:00.060
So, it was added? Yeah. And that's
cheaper than just using

13:00.095 --> 13:02.044
a real space ship.
I don't think it is.

13:02.079 --> 13:03.977
That stuff costs a bloody fortune.

13:04.012 --> 13:07.028
We know that now the bill has come
in. I'm sorry, I got carried away.

13:07.063 --> 13:08.049
Listen, stop bickering you two.

13:08.084 --> 13:14.056
We now have to do the news and that's impossible,
because it's not the week you think it is.

13:14.091 --> 13:20.052
It's actually December, December 9th.
It really is. We had the studiobooked for today,

13:20.087 --> 13:23.969
and we've had to use it even
though we know you're in 2010.

13:24.004 --> 13:28.021
This fly flying around here has
actually died by the time you watch this.

13:28.056 --> 13:34.024
The real problem is obviously, between now and when
you're watching this, anything could have happened.

13:34.059 --> 13:38.000
Somebody could have invented a car
that I don't know, runs on jelly.

13:38.035 --> 13:40.036
We might have declared
war with France...

13:40.071 --> 13:41.061
HE LAUGHS

13:41.096 --> 13:45.024
Instead of the news, what we're
going to do, we're going to take

13:45.059 --> 13:48.004
a look ahead to some cars
that are coming out

13:48.039 --> 13:51.017
this year. This year. This year. Yes!

13:51.052 --> 13:56.024
Lots of them, in fact. There's the new Jaguar
XJ, we're very much looking forward to that.

13:56.059 --> 13:58.981
The Aston Martin 177,
the million-pound Aston.

13:59.016 --> 14:03.020
But the one that really caught my
eye is this, it's the Honda CR-V,

14:03.055 --> 14:05.064
and I think you'll agree it
looks absolutely fantastic.

14:05.099 --> 14:08.001
However, I then read the bumpf.

14:08.036 --> 14:14.024
It has a 1.5 litre engine, and a
boot full of lithium ion batteries.

14:14.059 --> 14:16.049
That's not a bloody hybrid, is it?

14:16.084 --> 14:21.048
Yes. You see what they've done here,
this is organic tofu,

14:21.083 --> 14:25.040
dressed up as
a juicy steak. But don't be fooled.

14:25.075 --> 14:29.001
Don't be fooled, people. James?

14:29.036 --> 14:33.985
A car I'm really looking forward
to is the new Saab 95, here it is.

14:34.020 --> 14:39.080
Unless of course Saab wentbust in the last two weeks... Which is a real possibility!

14:39.115 --> 14:41.005
Seriously, James, really...

14:41.040 --> 14:44.005
Do this two ways, we will edit it. Yeah. Cover yourself.

14:44.040 --> 14:49.016
A car I'm really looking forward to
is the new Saab 95. There it is.

14:49.051 --> 14:52.072
A car I was looking forward to was
the new Saab 95.

14:52.107 --> 14:53.985
LAUGHTER

14:54.020 --> 14:57.036
That's what it was going to look
like. They said... They say...

14:57.071 --> 14:59.985
What? They said. Oh, yes. They say,

15:00.020 --> 15:03.052
or said, that it's
based on a jet fighter,

15:03.087 --> 15:05.049
or was, but it isn't wasn't.

15:05.084 --> 15:08.981
LAUGHTER
It's actually based on a Vauxhall.

15:09.016 --> 15:12.052
You can or could get three engines,
maybe you could get three engines.

15:12.087 --> 15:15.060
The best of which
was or is a 2.8 litre V6.

15:15.095 --> 15:16.973
That will start at about L25,000.

15:17.008 --> 15:21.989
It looks great.
James, why haven't you got a Saab?Because they've gone bust.

15:22.024 --> 15:29.032
But if they haven't, then it is a very good
question because I do actually quite like a Saab.

15:29.067 --> 15:32.040
They are a little bit alternative
and tend to be driven by quite

15:32.075 --> 15:34.092
interesting people. That's
why he got hasn't got one then!

15:34.127 --> 15:36.029
HE LAUGHS

15:36.064 --> 15:42.000
Here's a car I'm looking forward to.
911 Turbo Cabriolet.

15:42.035 --> 15:44.013
What?! Hammond, sorry!

15:44.048 --> 15:48.056
It's twin turbos, seven speed double
clutch gearbox, flappy paddles.

15:48.091 --> 15:50.053
I want one.

15:50.088 --> 15:53.552
How old are you?

15:53.587 --> 15:56.981
39. And 361 days.

15:57.016 --> 16:00.028
Technically, yeah.
You know what that means, don't you?

16:00.063 --> 16:03.005
The mid-life crisis is arriving.

16:03.040 --> 16:07.092
Soon you'll be growing your hair,
whitening your teeth...

16:07.127 --> 16:10.977
Have you bought a
Harley-Davidson recently?

16:11.012 --> 16:16.056
Yes. Have you? All right, it's
happening! I agree!

16:17.052 --> 16:19.997
I quite like the look of this.
This is the Citroen DS3.

16:20.032 --> 16:24.096
That's going to be about L12,000.
It's sort of the size of a Mini.

16:24.131 --> 16:26.989
Can I tell you the biggest problem
with this car?

16:27.024 --> 16:30.000
When we buy cars - and we all do
this whether we like it or not -

16:30.035 --> 16:32.519
we tend to think most of all about
what it will be worth

16:32.554 --> 16:34.969
when we come to sell it, which is
perfectly reasonable.

16:35.004 --> 16:39.004
The reason why we don't buy orange
and lime green cars is you think,

16:39.039 --> 16:41.033
I won't be able to sell it in a
couple of years,

16:41.068 --> 16:44.062
I'll get the grey one. I think
that's what will happen with this

16:44.097 --> 16:47.056
because you will look at it and go,
I really like this, but what if

16:47.091 --> 16:49.057
nobody else does and I won't be able
to sell it.

16:49.092 --> 16:52.025
Or what if it's as out of date as
Roger Moore's safari suit

16:52.060 --> 16:56.977
when he was James Bond? That's a
shame because right now it looks great.

16:57.012 --> 17:02.020
It looks fantastic. I think that's one of the
best-looking cars that will be coming out next year.

17:02.055 --> 17:05.049
No, you got it... No, this year.

17:05.084 --> 17:10.031
This BLEEP year! Right, stop!Oh, God!

17:10.067 --> 17:14.020
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
Oh, God!

17:15.076 --> 17:21.016
Let's move, on because this is another car I'm really looking forward to. It's this
- 911 GT3RS.

17:21.050 --> 17:24.001
Are you only
looking forward to 911s?

17:24.036 --> 17:28.009
I am having a mid-life crisis, it's
my right. I think that's a great car.

17:28.044 --> 17:32.566
Lighter, faster. I think it wouldhave been OK when you were in your30s, Hammond.

17:32.601 --> 17:37.088
I think it's bright and fun and people
will look at it and think I'm young in it.

17:37.123 --> 17:42.000
It's just a Beetle. It was designed
by Hitler and it's a Beetle.

17:42.035 --> 17:44.037
Yes, it was.

17:44.072 --> 17:46.054
It wasn't.
Was.

17:46.089 --> 17:48.001
Who says it was?

17:48.036 --> 17:50.046
Was it designed by Hitler?Yes.

17:50.081 --> 17:52.021
You remember, you were here.

17:52.056 --> 17:55.528
At least I'm looking forward
to something this year.

17:55.563 --> 17:59.000
You're just saying everything
is going to be terrible.

17:59.035 --> 18:00.033
Not everything.

18:00.068 --> 18:03.056
One car has caught my eye.

18:03.091 --> 18:05.973
Ferrari 458.

18:06.008 --> 18:10.044
This is the replacement for the 430.

18:10.079 --> 18:12.057
Hmmm. What do you mean - hmmm?

18:12.092 --> 18:17.084
I already think the Ferrari F430 is
the best car in the world.

18:17.119 --> 18:21.048
It makes my little fizzy...
My rude thing...

18:23.020 --> 18:27.072
I guarantee this is going to
be a lot better than a 430.

18:27.107 --> 18:30.993
If that's true it could explode.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.981
Does anybody else suddenly feel sick?

18:33.016 --> 18:36.524
Yes. I don't want to see your
fizzy rude penis blowing up...

18:36.559 --> 18:39.997
No, no, arrrgh! Let's just move on!
I don't want to know!

18:40.032 --> 18:46.068
The fact of the matter is this. This has got a lot
more tech than a 430. It's a lot lighter than a 430.

18:46.103 --> 18:50.012
I think the 430 has
about 480 horsepower.

18:50.047 --> 18:52.033
This has 562.

18:52.068 --> 18:56.012
The thing I love about it most of
all is that it's the first Ferrari

18:56.047 --> 19:02.084
since 1975 that actually looks
properly pretty. I'm just

19:02.119 --> 19:04.045
completely bowled over by it.

19:04.080 --> 19:09.056
Actually, we probably won't be
allowed to drive Ferraris because

19:09.091 --> 19:12.973
a couple of weeks ago,
before Christmas...

19:13.008 --> 19:18.973
Nice one. A big meetingin Copenhagen and many,many things were resolved there.

19:19.008 --> 19:24.040
One of them - I'm pretty certain - will be
that we have to get out of our cars more often.

19:24.075 --> 19:28.036
And that brings us
on to something we have over here.

19:28.071 --> 19:29.969
In this plastic suitcase

19:30.004 --> 19:34.080
is a folding the allegedly assisted
bicycle. It's called the Gocycle.

19:34.115 --> 19:38.087
I think you'll find
it's called the Go Cycle.

19:38.122 --> 19:42.025
Not the Gocycle, you idiot. That
says Gocycle.

19:42.060 --> 19:50.040
Never mind. It costs L1200
and, as you can see, it is...

19:52.000 --> 19:53.052
Oh.

19:54.068 --> 19:59.036
I thought it was a folding bicycle. It's
a bloody bag full of bicycle components.

19:59.071 --> 20:02.561
Have I got to build it? Would you
like me to give you a hand with it?

20:02.596 --> 20:06.052
That's the most terrifying thing
Jeremy Clarkson can say to anyone.

20:06.087 --> 20:09.033
I wonder if maybe you
two should go away.

20:09.068 --> 20:14.020
Good idea, because this is not
the only post Copenhagen solution.

20:14.055 --> 20:16.021
Hammond, what have you got here?I have this.

20:16.056 --> 20:20.044
What it is is a skateboard for people
who can't be bothered to skateboard.

20:20.079 --> 20:21.985
I'll get it all started up because

20:22.020 --> 20:25.052
it is electrically powered.
This device controls your speed.

20:25.087 --> 20:28.029
Why don't you give that
to me and I'll control it.

20:28.064 --> 20:31.036
No, that's the most terrifying
thing you can possibly say.

20:31.071 --> 20:33.004
Are you really going to ride that?Yes, I am.

20:33.039 --> 20:35.021
Apparently this has a curve system.

20:35.056 --> 20:37.977
Though how something can have
regenerative braking

20:38.012 --> 20:43.092
when I can't see how the brakes
work I don't know - but it works!

20:43.127 --> 20:46.013
This is much better.

20:46.048 --> 20:51.072
It was designed by a man who wanted something
that would combine his love of cross-country skiing

20:51.107 --> 20:55.048
and his love of cycling, and
then converted to run on batteries,

20:55.083 --> 20:58.025
by someone who didn't
like either of those things.

20:58.060 --> 21:06.048
It is quite pricey, L1,600, around about the
same as in 19995 Series BMW, but it is quite fast.

21:06.083 --> 21:09.000
Top speed is 15mph.

21:10.076 --> 21:14.538
Yeah, mine is faster.
I promise you this is quicker.

21:14.573 --> 21:19.000
Race. Race?! Come on.
Anyone want to see a race? Yeah!

21:21.000 --> 21:23.977
Back to here, lap of the studio.

21:24.012 --> 21:27.044
3, 2, 1- go. I've got
wheelspin, a lot of wheelspin.

21:30.088 --> 21:35.096
Come on, you stupid thing!I'm a 40-year-old man
taking up skateboarding.

21:35.131 --> 21:37.068
I've got grip, I've got grip!

21:41.068 --> 21:43.064
I've hit the wall!

21:45.020 --> 21:48.080
James, are you still working on that
thing? Yes. Want to go on this?

21:48.115 --> 21:51.060
No. It's great once you'vegot the hang of it. No.

21:51.095 --> 21:52.993
Suit yourself.
I'm a bit bored with this.

21:53.028 --> 21:57.037
I'm going to go and introduced
Jeremy's film on the BMW X6.

21:57.072 --> 22:02.064
Normally he would go and drive it in a
sewer or blow it up or something like that.

22:02.099 --> 22:07.048
Unfortunately, Richard Hammond
spent most of what we have left

22:07.083 --> 22:10.020
on his stupid... ARGH!

22:14.088 --> 22:16.061
Sorry.

22:16.096 --> 22:22.076
Unfortunately, Richard Hammond, who
has just broken our Christmas tree,

22:22.111 --> 22:26.037
spent most of what we had left
on his stupid Lexus film.

22:26.072 --> 22:33.060
Our instructions to Jeremy were very
specific. Keep it cheap and simple.

22:33.095 --> 22:37.092
Right. One simple film coming up.

22:37.127 --> 22:40.575
The X6 is BMW's attempt

22:40.610 --> 22:43.843
to make a car which looks,

22:43.878 --> 22:47.041
and goes, like a coupe,

22:47.076 --> 22:52.092
but has a tall driving position
and a bit of off-road ability.

22:52.127 --> 22:58.965
They call it
a Sports Activity Vehicle.

22:59.000 --> 23:04.060
It's available with a choice of two
petrol engines, both of which

23:04.095 --> 23:07.088
will attract the new L950
showroom tax...

23:07.123 --> 23:10.009
And two diesels which won't.

23:10.044 --> 23:12.049
In the cabin,
there is space for four.

23:12.084 --> 23:19.076
But those in the back will be awfully
cramped due to the sloping roof line.

23:19.111 --> 23:21.965
Inside it's all typical BMW,

23:22.000 --> 23:26.080
except for this rather clever split
opening glove box lid.

23:26.115 --> 23:29.021
It works well here.

23:29.056 --> 23:31.092
But what if
you're the wrong way up?

23:34.068 --> 23:40.997
To find out I went to Sydney,
which is in Australia.

23:41.032 --> 23:48.092
Obviously everything here is upside-down and yet
it still works beautifully. That is impressive.

23:48.127 --> 23:51.020
So...

23:52.012 --> 23:55.021
How does the X6 drive?

23:55.056 --> 23:58.033
In many ways, it's quite annoying.

23:58.068 --> 24:02.036
You can't see out of the back very
well and it's got the iDrive system

24:02.071 --> 24:04.080
which can only be operated
if you are 14.

24:06.092 --> 24:08.033
No.

24:08.068 --> 24:11.009
I don't know what any of that means.

24:11.044 --> 24:16.044
Satellite navigation. You are coming up to a
complicated junction, trying to see which way it is.

24:16.079 --> 24:21.000
You think it's a bit chilly, I'll just ease
the temperature up and the screen has gone!

24:21.035 --> 24:24.000
I don't know which way to
go because...

24:24.035 --> 24:25.096
Why are you telling me that?!

24:27.056 --> 24:29.001
Then there's the gear lever.

24:29.036 --> 24:34.056
It's on back-to-front cos if you
want to change down you push it away.

24:34.091 --> 24:36.057
If you want to change up
you pull it towards you.

24:36.092 --> 24:40.072
There's no point resorting to the paddles on
the steering wheel as unlike in a normal car,

24:40.107 --> 24:46.061
where one change is down and one change
is up, in this they both do the same thing.

24:46.096 --> 24:52.016
And what was the boss of BMW doing when
all the clowns in the laptop department

24:52.051 --> 24:54.037
were coming up with this rubbish?

24:54.072 --> 24:58.064
I can only assume she was
in a motel with a Swiss spy.

25:00.092 --> 25:02.985
That would be preposterous!

25:03.020 --> 25:08.036
Still, for a big, tall
car it's not bad in bends.

25:08.071 --> 25:11.537
Unfortunately, to make it not bad,

25:11.572 --> 25:14.969
they have had to put quite a lot

25:15.004 --> 25:18.080
of beef and granite
in the suspension.

25:18.084 --> 25:22.568
In Britain that makes it
really quite uncomfortable.

25:22.603 --> 25:27.052
But what about countries
where the roads are smooth?

25:27.087 --> 25:30.084
To find out, I went to Spain.

25:41.020 --> 25:45.040
No, it's uncomfortable here as well.

25:51.004 --> 25:56.056
The fact is this - it would be more
comfortable if it weren't so tall.

25:56.091 --> 26:00.965
There's a similar problem
with the performance.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.005
Yes, the twin-turbo three litre
diesel that I've got in this

26:04.040 --> 26:09.036
particular model will get me from 0
- 60 in seven seconds, and that's not bad.

26:09.071 --> 26:14.052
But how much faster and how much
more economical would it have been

26:14.087 --> 26:17.028
if the body wasn't so enormous?

26:19.096 --> 26:21.997
You'd imagine that the advantages

26:22.032 --> 26:28.028
of that big, high riding body would
become clear in the countryside.

26:28.063 --> 26:31.033
But there's no low-range gearbox,

26:31.068 --> 26:38.056
there's no ride-high control and
there's no locking differentials.

26:42.012 --> 26:47.016
It doesn't take long for those
omissions to have an effect.

26:56.016 --> 26:57.997
You see,

26:58.032 --> 27:01.004
that really says a lot, doesn't it?

27:01.039 --> 27:02.981
The only way round this

27:03.016 --> 27:07.076
is to get out and complete
your journey on foot.

27:10.008 --> 27:13.092
That's the handbrake on and in park.

27:17.012 --> 27:18.057
Help!

27:18.092 --> 27:22.080
I'm still going down the hill.

27:25.024 --> 27:28.985
Maybe it can handle snow
a bit better.

27:29.020 --> 27:34.036
To find out I went to the
highest ski resort in the Alps.

27:50.068 --> 27:53.001
No.

27:53.036 --> 27:55.037
It can't.

27:55.072 --> 28:01.052
So it's too focused on being a
road car to be any good off-road.

28:01.087 --> 28:04.096
And it's too focused
on being tall and heavy

28:04.131 --> 28:08.001
to be any good on the road either.

28:08.036 --> 28:11.061
And that, I'm afraid,
is far from the end of the story.

28:11.096 --> 28:17.032
You see, the X6 was conceived at a time when we
all thought the banks knew what they were doing.

28:17.067 --> 28:22.092
But it went on sale moments after
we discovered they didn't.

28:24.048 --> 28:29.056
And, I'm sorry, but in a recession a
car like this just looks ridiculous.

28:33.052 --> 28:37.064
To explain what I'm on about
I went in search of a metaphor.

28:37.099 --> 28:40.020
And, inevitably,
that led me to Hong Kong.

28:52.008 --> 28:56.045
You see that skyscraper,
the one Batman jumped off?

28:56.080 --> 29:01.008
It's not particularly beautiful,
it's not particularly useful.

29:01.043 --> 29:04.063
It was built by a world for a world

29:04.098 --> 29:07.084
that doesn't really exist any more.

29:07.119 --> 29:09.092
Remind you of anything?

29:11.072 --> 29:16.068
To sum up, the Range Rover
is a much better all-rounder.

29:16.103 --> 29:21.989
Which is why we use them
as camera tracking cars.

29:22.024 --> 29:29.056
The X6 is too cramped, too complicated
and, with prices starting at L42,000,

29:29.091 --> 29:31.029
too expensive as well!

29:31.064 --> 29:39.032
Then you're going to need at least L1,500 a
year to run it, not including depreciation.

29:39.067 --> 29:45.000
And I think I'd rather spend that
sort of money on a Caribbean holiday.

29:48.036 --> 29:51.056
To find out, I went to Barbados.

29:57.020 --> 30:00.028
I think a bit more research.

30:14.032 --> 30:18.048
No. This is definitely better -
definitely.

30:22.072 --> 30:25.540
APPLAUSE
Thank you very much.

30:25.575 --> 30:29.008
I pride myself on my thoroughness.

30:29.043 --> 30:31.013
What? Excuse me.

30:31.048 --> 30:34.965
What?You are an apocalyptic dingleberry.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.510
Why? You went to the Alps. Yes.
You went to Spain. Yes.

30:38.545 --> 30:42.020
You went to Australia to see
if the glove box works. Yes.

30:42.055 --> 30:43.993
You went to Barbados. Yes. You went to...

30:44.028 --> 30:48.040
Hong Kong. That was just for astupid metaphor. Yes, I did do that.

30:48.075 --> 30:50.973
You're a bigger idiot
than Richard Hammond.

30:51.008 --> 30:54.084
You know what it means? What? What
it meant was there was virtually

30:54.119 --> 30:57.997
no money left for my film,
which you can see later.

30:58.032 --> 31:00.025
I promise I didn't do
it deliberately. Really?!

31:00.060 --> 31:04.973
It's now time to put a star
in our reasonably priced car.

31:05.008 --> 31:09.056
Now, because of the budget issues this
week, we did have a bit of a problem.

31:09.091 --> 31:14.557
Tom Cruise, for example,
was going to charge us L150.

31:14.592 --> 31:19.989
Bonio out of U2 wanted
175 quid to come over here.

31:20.024 --> 31:24.072
So, would you please welcome
a former tramp? Seasick Steve.

31:24.107 --> 31:27.068
APPLAUSE

31:29.088 --> 31:37.080
Sorry about this. How are you? Have a seat.
We have an accident every year and there it is.

31:37.115 --> 31:42.993
I should explain to those of you who
are thinking and the tramp is who?

31:43.028 --> 31:49.068
This guy is a musical sensation. I mean Brit
nominee, when was it, last year? Glastonbury.

31:49.103 --> 31:55.060
My wife queued up for five daysto come and see that show you did. I'm sorry.

31:55.095 --> 31:58.989
You have become this
amazing sensation.

31:59.024 --> 32:02.068
The instruments you play aren't
exactly conventional instruments.

32:02.103 --> 32:05.005
I mean, your guitar, for example.

32:05.040 --> 32:09.037
I don't play the guitar but I know
they have six strings. Yours doesn't.

32:09.072 --> 32:15.052
I've got some that have got one string but that's
just a plank of wood with a string nailed on it.

32:15.087 --> 32:17.041
That's called a diddlybo.

32:17.076 --> 32:23.028
I've got this other guitar that's got three strings
that I got from a friend of mine in Mississippi.

32:23.063 --> 32:24.981
He found it at a junk store.

32:25.016 --> 32:30.008
I brought it home and my wife looked at that
guitar and goes, "That's going to make you famous. "

32:30.043 --> 32:35.068
And it has! Because, one day, a little known
broadcasting organisation called the BBC

32:35.103 --> 32:38.060
called up and said, "Could you
come on the Jools Holland Show?"

32:38.095 --> 32:41.965
I didn't even know
what Jools Holland was.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.016
Just so that people can understand
the noise that Steve can make out of

32:46.051 --> 32:49.020
this three-string guitar,
just have a listen to this.

32:53.092 --> 32:56.088
# The dog house
Dog house

32:56.123 --> 33:02.008
# Sing the dog house

33:04.012 --> 33:05.985
# Sing the dog house

33:06.020 --> 33:09.040
# Sing the dog house... #

33:13.060 --> 33:17.080
I had to just do that so you could just hear
that this... Where does that voice come from?

33:17.115 --> 33:19.561
Obviously your mouth.

33:19.596 --> 33:21.973
Drinking? Drinking.

33:22.008 --> 33:25.061
So your first hit album, I should
say, it was called

33:25.096 --> 33:30.058
I Started Out With Nothing And
I've Still Got Most Of It Left.

33:30.093 --> 33:35.020
Yes. Which I think is the best
album title literally of all time.

33:35.055 --> 33:37.049
The new one's called...?A Man From Another Time.

33:37.084 --> 33:41.568
Again, pretty apt. We're going to
get on to this name - Seasick Steve.

33:41.603 --> 33:46.052
Forgive me for asking. You must have
been asked a million times but why?

33:46.087 --> 33:49.041
I just get sick on boats.

33:49.076 --> 33:55.001
Like real sick. I don't go out
on the boats too much.

33:55.036 --> 34:00.064
I went on a ferry boat from Norway to
Denmark and threw up all night long.

34:00.099 --> 34:03.040
The next morning, someone thought
it was funny. You're Seasick Steve!

34:03.075 --> 34:06.009
And that stuck? Yeah, sort of.

34:06.044 --> 34:10.036
You may be Seasick Steve but you can't be Carsick
Steve because what you probably don't realise,

34:10.071 --> 34:14.025
we haven't got to this bit,
we've got a serious car man here.

34:14.060 --> 34:20.088
How many cars have you ownedover the years? I try to count. I know it's in the hundreds.

34:20.123 --> 34:22.981
In America, cars are real cheap.

34:23.016 --> 34:28.041
You can buy a late '30s,
early '40s car for 50 bucks.

34:28.076 --> 34:31.068
So I'd buy it for 50 and drive it
for two or three weeks until it died

34:31.103 --> 34:34.060
and leave it on the end of the road
and then go and get another one.

34:34.094 --> 34:36.965
They were all over.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.025
What was the favourite
from this list of hundreds?

34:39.060 --> 34:43.043
My favourite truly is a car I have
right now which I've had for a while.

34:43.079 --> 34:45.976
It's a '51 Chevy station wagon.

34:46.012 --> 34:50.029
It's just a complete beat-up car butit runs good. Where is that now?

34:50.063 --> 34:56.032
It's actually over here. I've got
it over here now. You keep it in theUK? Yeah, I've got it over here.

34:56.067 --> 35:00.032
I've got that and a tractor. You've
got to do a bit of farming then?

35:00.067 --> 35:04.009
I don't care about the farming
part but I like ploughing.

35:04.044 --> 35:07.554
So, presumably, I was listening
to a comedian on the radio the other

35:07.589 --> 35:11.304
day talking about the importance
and reliability of getting to gigs.

35:11.339 --> 35:14.689
Yeah. You don't use the Chevy.
Because presumably it's, "I'm sorry,

35:14.724 --> 35:18.040
"Seasick Steve can't appear tonight
because his Chevy's broken down. "

35:18.075 --> 35:22.060
I've got one of those big Mercedes
vans, like a big white one.

35:22.095 --> 35:25.595
It's got like a wood burning
stove and fishing gear.

35:25.630 --> 35:29.061
It's got like a log cabin inside.
It's real nice.

35:29.096 --> 35:34.092
There's all these lines of those big tour
buses and then my old beat-up van in the middle.

35:34.127 --> 35:36.985
Seasick Steve's arrived.

35:37.020 --> 35:39.009
They saw me coming a long way away.

35:39.044 --> 35:43.000
So, you've not called
the eco-bug then? What's that?

35:43.035 --> 35:45.973
It was a thing in Copenhagen.

35:46.008 --> 35:50.016
You've got to have a Toyota Prius
now - a hybrid. No, thanks.

35:50.051 --> 35:54.024
My boy told me I could drive
my '51 Chevy the rest of my life,

35:54.059 --> 35:56.029
and all the life I've had before,

35:56.064 --> 35:59.088
and not make as much pollution as
one of them new cars costs to make.

35:59.123 --> 36:03.092
I'll stick with the '51 Chevy,
thank you. Yes, good man.

36:03.127 --> 36:10.017
That's the ticket.
One of the things I noticed,

36:10.052 --> 36:16.004
looking back through the list of the hundreds of cars
you've owned, there's MGs, S-type Jag, E-type Jag.

36:16.039 --> 36:19.997
You do like British cars. Yeah.
Why? I like the way...

36:20.032 --> 36:24.092
Not all of them but I like the way they smell inside them old ones
- the leather and everything.

36:24.127 --> 36:28.048
What is a Morris Minor doing in
there? That is Britain's Beetle.

36:28.083 --> 36:33.973
I was up in Liverpool playing
up there a few years back.

36:34.008 --> 36:38.046
I met this guy who had, I think a '55 split window. An early one.

36:38.081 --> 36:42.084
He asked me if I wanted to buy it. I said, yeah. Punch him, punch him!

36:42.119 --> 36:46.981
My friend, he has Morris Minors.

36:47.016 --> 36:53.000
He thought it would be real funny to
make me a guitar out of Morris Minors.

36:53.035 --> 36:54.969
Seriously?These are two Morris Minor hubcaps.

36:55.004 --> 36:58.064
That's the best use I've ever seen for anything
on a Morris Minor. Go on, play it! Let's hear it.

36:58.099 --> 37:03.024
So, now you can have something goodto say about a Morris Minor. Yeah.

37:03.059 --> 37:04.045
Maybe not.

37:04.080 --> 37:06.017
Are you going to give us a tune?

37:06.052 --> 37:08.072
No, I'm not going to give you a
tune, I'm going to make a noise.

37:14.040 --> 37:15.057
Morris Minor.

37:15.092 --> 37:19.013
I'm startled. A Morris Minor noise.

37:19.048 --> 37:23.008
That's the best use
of a Morris Minor ever.

37:23.043 --> 37:24.049
So, OK, the car man.

37:24.084 --> 37:28.072
You came down here and drove possibly the
most modern car you've ever driven then.

37:28.107 --> 37:33.084
My biggest problem is the shifter'son the wrong side. Correct side.

37:33.119 --> 37:37.053
I kept rolling the window down.

37:37.088 --> 37:41.049
But it is. I have to say that Lacetti
is getting a bit knackered now.

37:41.084 --> 37:47.020
I didn't help at all. I apologise. No, we're thinking of gettinga new car for the next series.

37:47.055 --> 37:49.567
You would be the last person
ever to go on the board.

37:49.602 --> 37:52.311
I'm probably be the last
person on the board, too.

37:52.346 --> 37:55.020
Like a double whammy!Who'd like to see Seasick's lap?

37:55.055 --> 37:59.000
Yes!
Let's have a look how it went.

37:59.035 --> 38:02.072
I'm embarrassed now.

38:04.032 --> 38:07.068
Now, I'm trying to remember
all the things Stig told me.

38:07.103 --> 38:09.575
I can hardly remember...

38:09.610 --> 38:12.013
What day is it actually?

38:12.048 --> 38:18.064
I've no idea. That is a beard in a car and that it
is tidy line cutting the corner.

38:18.099 --> 38:20.969
That's OK. A bit damp.

38:21.004 --> 38:23.969
A lot of under steer there.

38:24.004 --> 38:28.072
You can make a lot of noise but you ain't
going very fast when you make the noise.

38:28.107 --> 38:31.993
That's true.
We've got more understeer here. Yes.

38:32.028 --> 38:36.004
Quite a lot through there.
That's slowing you down a bit.

38:36.039 --> 38:37.981
The radio came on.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.092
I don't want to hear no radio.

38:39.127 --> 38:43.021
I'm busy racing, dude.

38:43.056 --> 38:46.001
Dipping nicely into Hammerhead.

38:46.036 --> 38:51.044
This looks like a good line. Yes,
looking very tidy on the way in.

38:51.079 --> 38:53.044
And on the way out?

38:53.079 --> 38:54.993
Very nice.

38:55.028 --> 38:57.092
This is embarrassing. No, it isn't. This gear change was.

38:57.127 --> 38:59.025
That's the worst.

38:59.060 --> 39:06.012
This is the most fun I've probably ever had in my
whole life and that's probably kind of pathetic.

39:08.080 --> 39:12.088
Let's have a look through here. Let's
see if you've got to any gentleman's...

39:12.123 --> 39:14.575
This car...

39:14.610 --> 39:16.993
is amazing.

39:17.028 --> 39:19.053
Fast - that is quick.

39:19.088 --> 39:21.592
Coming into the
second to last corner.

39:21.627 --> 39:24.061
Don't go on the grass, it's too wet.

39:24.096 --> 39:30.096
You're on the grass a bit there.
Go, go, go! And around Gander.

39:30.131 --> 39:32.595
A little bit slow on that one.

39:32.630 --> 39:35.025
Across the line, everybody.

39:35.060 --> 39:41.076
Very well done!
Very well done. Oh, boy!

39:46.044 --> 39:48.977
You care, don't you?

39:49.012 --> 39:53.060
I really care. I know I let down theside but you got to give it a shot. You gave it a shot.

39:53.095 --> 39:57.061
I tried to get points for being a
little older but they didn't go for it.

39:57.096 --> 40:01.072
I'd love to cheat here and give you a fast
time but unfortunately it was a slow one.

40:01.107 --> 40:07.036
I know that. It wasn't a slow one.
What it was was, ready?

40:07.071 --> 40:12.036
One minute and, bearing
in mind it was moist, 51.8.

40:12.071 --> 40:13.088
Which means you go there.

40:19.088 --> 40:25.020
You're faster than Tom Jones. That's enough. I'll take that.

40:25.055 --> 40:26.981
That's good enough for me.

40:27.016 --> 40:31.048
And he was in the dry.
You're faster than Helen Mirren...

40:31.083 --> 40:33.037
Don't rub it in no more.

40:33.072 --> 40:38.036
That's kind of it. Steve,
this has been an absolute joy.

40:38.071 --> 40:41.005
A 100% pleasure for me. 100%.

40:41.040 --> 40:44.048
Ladies and gentlemen, Seasick Steve. Thank you very much.

40:46.028 --> 40:51.036
Thank you so much. Great music.

40:54.024 --> 40:58.969
Right. It is now time
for me to present my film.

40:59.004 --> 41:02.060
And, for reasons that I am sure
by now are abundantly clear,

41:02.095 --> 41:06.080
it's about a medium-sized
Vauxhall and a nice old lady.

41:08.084 --> 41:12.020
Right, here we go.
A lengthy yet hopefully interesting

41:12.055 --> 41:15.045
and value-for-money film
about a Vauxhall.

41:15.080 --> 41:21.008
If you're a proper car bore, you will
know that anything wearing the VXR badge,

41:21.043 --> 41:22.053
I have one here
on the steering wheel,

41:22.088 --> 41:27.028
is part of Vauxhall's
Turbo Nutter ASBO range.

41:27.063 --> 41:29.016
And so it turns out.

41:33.004 --> 41:38.024
The engine, for example,
is a turbo-charged 2.8 litre V6.

41:38.059 --> 41:42.012
Which produces
a meaty 321 horse power.

41:43.012 --> 41:46.985
That's a few horse power short of
our old track favourite, the VXR8,

41:47.020 --> 41:52.088
but, nevertheless, this executive-style
car is good for 60 in under 6 seconds.

41:52.123 --> 41:56.969
If it didn't have
the hand of nannying,

41:57.004 --> 42:01.016
an electronic speed limiter,
it would do 170 miles an hour.

42:02.016 --> 42:03.068
It does shift, this thing.

42:04.096 --> 42:08.080
And the performance modifications
don't stop with the engine.

42:08.115 --> 42:12.068
321 horse power is asking
a lot of front-wheel drive.

42:12.103 --> 42:14.985
This version has four-wheel drive

42:15.020 --> 42:18.064
to keep everything nice and calm
and civilised and under control.

42:18.099 --> 42:21.091
It also has a very clever
front suspension,

42:21.126 --> 42:24.084
very similar to the one
used on the Focus RS,

42:24.119 --> 42:26.056
which, as we know, is very good.

42:28.084 --> 42:35.068
Also, the suspension has been lowered by 10mm
and you can choose from different driver settings.

42:35.103 --> 42:38.969
At the moment I'm in normal mode,
which is the one I like,

42:39.004 --> 42:44.004
but if I press this button, "sport"
- now the suspension is firmed up a little bit.

42:44.039 --> 42:47.001
Can I feel that? Yes.

42:47.036 --> 42:49.969
But lots of cars
have a sport button.

42:50.004 --> 42:53.080
The insignia, however, has
another one that goes up to 11.

42:53.115 --> 42:57.064
This one which is marked "VXR".

43:02.020 --> 43:04.993
Press that and the
suspension gets even harder.

43:05.028 --> 43:11.024
The throttle response is sharpened up a bit but,
most importantly, the instruments become red!

43:11.059 --> 43:13.049
I mean, that's just fantastic.

43:13.084 --> 43:18.000
It's a fire-breathing monster
with a spine of iron.

43:21.052 --> 43:24.973
And the prize for all
this VXR-ishness?

43:25.008 --> 43:27.969
Just over L30,000,
which, in Top Gear maths,

43:28.004 --> 43:33.032
where we tend to round things up a bit,
makes it actually pretty good value.

43:33.067 --> 43:39.072
Because the equivalent Audi S4
would be nearly L5,000 more.

43:39.107 --> 43:42.064
And that's all you really
need to know about it.

43:42.099 --> 43:45.000
But, obviously,
I have to keep going.

43:47.072 --> 43:53.052
So I will, by explaining that the
insignia VXR is surprisingly restrained,

43:53.087 --> 43:55.048
both to look at and to sit in.

43:57.024 --> 44:00.973
It is, therefore,
the first de-chavved VXR.

44:01.008 --> 44:06.020
The first fast Vauxhall that would know
which way round a baseball cap goes.

44:08.092 --> 44:11.993
This is actually a very
civilised car. It's very quiet.

44:12.028 --> 44:18.004
The ride is very good and yet, without the
VXR button on, it still goes like stink.

44:19.000 --> 44:25.036
It's also very spacious and it has a big boot
- and much more equipment than a pricier Audi.

44:25.071 --> 44:29.024
And now I really have
run out of things to say.

44:29.059 --> 44:30.989
But rather than go
back to the studio,

44:31.024 --> 44:35.052
I'm going to introduce you to
someone I've always wanted to meet.

44:35.087 --> 44:38.075
A lady called Margaret Calvert.

44:38.110 --> 44:41.064
And here she is. Hello, Margaret.

44:41.099 --> 44:42.977
Hello, James.

44:43.012 --> 44:45.053
You may never have heard
of Margaret but, believe me,

44:45.088 --> 44:50.036
if you are a motorist in Britain, she's one
of the most important people in your life.

44:50.071 --> 44:52.037
If it hadn't been for Margaret
and her mates,

44:52.072 --> 44:57.068
I would now be going the wrong way or
possibly even having a terrible crash.

45:00.008 --> 45:04.061
You see, Margaret, along with
her colleague Jock Kinneir,

45:04.096 --> 45:10.052
is responsible for creating something special
that we take for granted every single day.

45:10.087 --> 45:12.096
The road signs of Britain.

45:16.064 --> 45:22.092
I think you've perhaps made me
more important than I really am.

45:22.127 --> 45:24.048
Oh, I doubt it.

45:26.056 --> 45:30.985
Margaret's work began in the 1950s,
when car ownership was booming

45:31.020 --> 45:36.516
and the Government, alarmed at the clogged-up
roads, decided to build the first motorways.

45:36.551 --> 45:42.012
However, existing road signs were totally
inadequate for the new, high-speed highways.

45:43.012 --> 45:46.084
No one designed motorway signs before
because we hadn't had a motorway. Yes.

45:46.119 --> 45:50.067
And the whole job of making that
system of signs clear to the car,

45:50.102 --> 45:54.016
which was still a new thing for
most people... The driver, yes.

45:54.051 --> 45:55.981
And at speeds that were still new...

45:56.016 --> 45:59.040
That all fell to a man and his
former student from an art college.

45:59.075 --> 46:01.013
They gave you the whole job. Absolutely.

46:01.048 --> 46:06.540
We were both on a crash-course
learning curve

46:06.575 --> 46:11.997
to come to grips with
designing road signs.

46:12.032 --> 46:15.973
It wasn't a fashion thing.
We were designing for permanence.

46:16.008 --> 46:20.096
We were designing for something that
wouldn't look dated in 5 or 10 years' time.

46:20.131 --> 46:24.013
Margaret explained how
the colour system of our road signs

46:24.048 --> 46:28.056
was carefully designed to make words
and numbers as clear as possible

46:28.091 --> 46:31.593
at the high speeds motorway-borne
cars could then achieve.

46:31.628 --> 46:35.096
And she and Jock horrified
the signposting establishment

46:35.131 --> 46:38.581
by using upper
and lowercase letters,

46:38.616 --> 46:41.330
instead of the accepted
block capitals.

46:41.365 --> 46:44.009
And that's to do
with word recognition.

46:44.044 --> 46:48.013
You read a shape, whereas if it's all
in capitals, it takes you longer to read.

46:48.048 --> 46:52.068
So you don't have to read it in upper and lower.
You see the shape and you know what it says.

46:52.103 --> 46:56.057
Exactly that. So your brain
fills in, you know, the middle bits.

46:56.092 --> 47:01.056
Most people wouldn't realise how involved this is.
They'd think it's just lettering you stick on a sign.

47:01.091 --> 47:05.020
Absolutely, yes. And it still works.
It's basically the same system.

47:06.092 --> 47:09.053
Margaret's work didn't stop
at motorway signs

47:09.088 --> 47:17.088
because she and Jock then went on to design just about
every other road sign you see in the Highway Code.

47:17.123 --> 47:19.587
So you designed
a new type-face... Yes.

47:19.622 --> 47:22.017
.. Which became known
as Transport. Yes.

47:22.052 --> 47:26.092
And then you had to design the actual
pictures for your warning signs. Yes.

47:26.127 --> 47:31.024
That's you, isn't it? That was
actually a very difficult one to do.

47:31.059 --> 47:34.013
The important thing was to
make it look like an action.

47:34.048 --> 47:40.028
That it would really alert you to the possibility
of two children walking across the road,

47:40.063 --> 47:44.036
so hopefully you would try to
save lives by getting that right.

47:44.071 --> 47:47.559
The previous sign had
a grammar-school boy

47:47.594 --> 47:51.013
with a satchel
and the girl behind him.

47:51.048 --> 47:54.068
And they weren't holding hands
or anything like that.

47:54.103 --> 47:57.088
And I just thought that this
is a little bit more caring

47:57.123 --> 47:59.087
and so I switched it round.

47:59.122 --> 48:01.017
I based that, actually, on me.

48:01.052 --> 48:03.965
I based it on
what I wore as a child.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.969
So is that actually you?It is, actually, yes.

48:08.004 --> 48:12.009
At this point, I was starting
to run out of intelligent questions.

48:12.044 --> 48:16.008
What do you make of the car? Because
I can't quite make my mind up but...

48:16.043 --> 48:18.021
They always have faces,
don't they? Yes.

48:18.056 --> 48:23.016
And I think some kind of look very
shark-like, some look very aggressive.

48:23.051 --> 48:26.080
It looks like a car that's
been designed by a committee.

48:26.115 --> 48:30.029
And then I ran out of
intelligent things to say.

48:30.064 --> 48:35.020
But would you agree with me that it
would look a bit sexier in glasses?

48:35.055 --> 48:39.076
That's a very interesting...
I think you're quite unusual.

48:41.064 --> 48:46.008
Back on the road, we inevitably came
across one of her most commonly-used signs.

48:46.043 --> 48:48.053
The story I read about you
was that you did that sign

48:48.088 --> 48:54.048
and then the joke emerged it was a man struggling
with an umbrella and that joke's been around for years.

48:54.083 --> 48:58.040
And that annoyed you and you wished
you'd done it slightly differently?

48:58.075 --> 49:01.072
Well, I would have put a shoulder
on it, just. And I'd... Huh?

49:01.107 --> 49:03.985
Oh, what, you want me to draw it on?

49:04.020 --> 49:06.084
Yes. No. Come on.
I'm not doing it. I'll do it.

49:06.119 --> 49:10.008
But I want you to direct me. OK.

49:13.040 --> 49:16.016
Right, think of drawing a spade.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.057
As if you're drawing a spade, yeah?

49:21.092 --> 49:25.080
What do you think?
Well, I think from here,

49:25.115 --> 49:27.056
it's sort of, it's wrong.

49:29.008 --> 49:34.036
Not only did she not like my drawing, she
didn't find my gear changes very good either.

49:36.028 --> 49:39.048
That was a bit of a... Yes, sorry,
that wasn't very good, was it?

49:39.083 --> 49:41.577
No, that wasn't a good gear. Let's try that again.

49:41.612 --> 49:44.336
Yeah, do that. I was trying
to be clever. Oh, right.

49:44.371 --> 49:47.025
Skipping the cogs, so we're
doubling down into second.

49:47.060 --> 49:51.076
Oh, right, yes. Even then, it
was a little bit juddery. Now...

49:51.111 --> 49:55.092
Yeah, a bit... Is that better?A bit better. Could be smoother.

49:55.127 --> 49:56.061
Sorry.

49:56.096 --> 49:59.029
I decided to speed up,

49:59.064 --> 50:01.092
and that didn't work either.

50:01.127 --> 50:02.985
Oh my gosh!

50:03.020 --> 50:06.969
Margaret didn't like
this sort of driving.

50:07.004 --> 50:11.001
And as we headed for home, plainly,
she decided to get her own back.

50:11.036 --> 50:17.032
Big road sign. It is nice to thinkthat your legacy is spread all overthe country. Well, it is a legacy.

50:17.067 --> 50:21.060
I suppose. And that's why I end up
sitting next to people like you.

50:21.095 --> 50:23.040
Talking about road signs.

50:25.044 --> 50:29.080
Did you put my seat heater onfor a joke? No, I didn't. Is it on?

50:39.084 --> 50:43.009
Well done, mate. Good work.
Well done.

50:43.044 --> 50:48.056
I have to say, when Margaret came on, it got
better, OK? The thing is though, I have a question.

50:48.091 --> 50:53.068
She really designed all of the road signs of
Britain? Well, her and, what was it, four others?

50:53.103 --> 50:55.017
Four or five people in total, yes.

50:55.052 --> 50:59.044
Because I was thinking, if they decided
to change all the road signs now,

50:59.079 --> 51:02.004
how many people would
this government employ?

51:02.039 --> 51:03.049
A million. It would.

51:03.084 --> 51:08.060
They'd want 5,000 people just to decide what
the little girl on the school sign looked like.

51:08.095 --> 51:11.001
Oh yes, should she
have a burka, a turban?

51:11.036 --> 51:15.072
And then that man in the "men at
work" sign is clearly a man... Yes!

51:15.107 --> 51:17.045
And that's not right.
No. They'd rectify that.

51:17.080 --> 51:22.028
In the modern "men at work" sign there wouldn't
be a man, just be a pile of unused gravel.

51:22.063 --> 51:24.965
Just a queue of cars
stopped for no reason.

51:25.000 --> 51:29.084
It's OK, we've filled the time now.
OK. Er, so, let's move on

51:29.119 --> 51:32.037
to the Top Gear award ceremony!

51:32.072 --> 51:36.013
Oh, yes. This is the biggie. Oh, yes!

51:36.048 --> 51:40.036
It's a big day. It is a biggie. A big day in the calendar.

51:40.071 --> 51:42.013
A big day for us all.

51:42.048 --> 51:45.057
What are you doing? What... What? Just that.

51:45.092 --> 51:49.084
It's an award ceremony, I'm wearing
a gold lame jacket. It's appropriate.

51:49.119 --> 51:51.037
It's quite sudden, isn't it?

51:51.072 --> 51:56.049
Erm, anyway.
First award is Injury of the Year.

51:56.084 --> 52:03.036
And the nominations are - Richard in
our Headhammer Thrust i-Eagle, Geoff.

52:03.071 --> 52:06.016
We're going to crash.

52:06.051 --> 52:08.037
Ow, my chest!

52:08.072 --> 52:11.016
Jeremy making paint-ball art.

52:11.051 --> 52:12.020
Ready!

52:14.060 --> 52:16.096
Ah!

52:22.008 --> 52:25.045
And James on a gangplank in Bolivia.

52:25.080 --> 52:28.044
It's like literally beingwith Livingstone... Yeah.

52:28.079 --> 52:29.096
And...

52:33.036 --> 52:37.016
Mm-mm! It was a good one.
A good moment there, mate.

52:37.051 --> 52:39.044
Well done.
Both of us did cough blood.

52:42.036 --> 52:47.096
I have the winner here. Injury of
the Year award and the winner is...

52:47.131 --> 52:49.021
It's actually none of those.

52:49.056 --> 52:52.005
Now, I should say
before I announce this,

52:52.040 --> 52:59.000
that when we film a car on Top Gear, there is always
a light, OK, in the top corner of the windscreen.

52:59.035 --> 53:04.041
Now, we've been doing this show for
years, so it would be impossible to forget

53:04.076 --> 53:11.076
that that light is there and that it's very
sharp, unless, of course, you were a colossal anus.

53:11.111 --> 53:15.008
East Midlands airport. You might have to...

53:15.043 --> 53:16.565
What? The camera.

53:16.600 --> 53:18.088
What have you done?

53:20.064 --> 53:25.088
Ow! BLEEP It really hurts. Agh!

53:28.072 --> 53:30.049
Well done, chaps.

53:30.084 --> 53:35.096
Gosh. It's an honour.
It is an honour.

53:35.131 --> 53:37.985
Thank you. Thank you.

53:38.020 --> 53:40.049
Now, as always, we present an award

53:40.084 --> 53:46.977
to the person who's driven around our track
fastest of all in the course of the year.

53:47.012 --> 53:53.020
The fastest man around the Top Gear track, the
fastest celebrity in the reasonably-priced car,

53:53.055 --> 53:55.076
from AC/DC, it's Brian Johnson!

53:57.076 --> 53:59.981
Sadly, Brian is in Florida
at the moment

54:00.016 --> 54:04.512
and none of us could be bothered to
go over there and give him his award.

54:04.547 --> 54:09.313
But we did find a film crew who very
kindly volunteered to do it for us.

54:09.348 --> 54:14.080
Thanks very much for this wonderful
honour and for this fabulous trophy.

54:14.115 --> 54:16.084
You must have spent
a fortune on this!

54:16.119 --> 54:18.037
My name's Brian, not "Brain".

54:18.072 --> 54:22.048
And that's an ice hockey player
on top of there, look. Never mind.

54:22.083 --> 54:23.985
This'll do me for now.

54:24.020 --> 54:28.028
So have a great time at Christmas
and I'll see you soon, guys.

54:28.063 --> 54:30.053
Thanks, everybody. Bye-bye.

54:30.088 --> 54:36.060
Brain Johnson! Well, I'm sorry.
That's the worst thing we've everdone. It was cheap. It was cheap.

54:36.095 --> 54:41.072
And now it's time to get serious, because
it's time for our Car of the Year award, OK.

54:41.107 --> 54:43.965
This, of course, is an
extremely coveted award.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.020
Manufacturers all over the world
will be watching with bated breath.

54:47.055 --> 54:50.973
OK, the nominations
are the new Volkswagen Polo.

54:51.008 --> 54:55.969
It's already won the slightly less
coveted European Car of the Year award.

54:56.004 --> 55:03.000
And the Kia Ceed, for its pleasing equipment levels
and ground-breaking seven-year comprehensive warranty.

55:03.035 --> 55:11.096
And the Suzuki Alto, for its willing engine
and its attractive price tag of just L7,495.

55:11.131 --> 55:16.020
And the winner for being much,
much better than all of those,

55:16.055 --> 55:19.032
is the Lamborghini Gallardo Balboni!

55:19.067 --> 55:20.029
Yes. Oh, yeah.

55:20.064 --> 55:22.546
Oh, yeah. What a winner.

55:22.581 --> 55:25.028
That's as it should be.

55:26.028 --> 55:30.020
We were impressed with
its stripe, it's V10 engine,

55:30.055 --> 55:34.012
its rear-wheel drive,
the savagery of its exhaust,

55:34.047 --> 55:36.041
and its stripe.

55:36.076 --> 55:40.008
No, seriously,
we think the Polo is tremendous, OK?

55:40.043 --> 55:41.977
Beautifully made and so on.

55:42.012 --> 55:44.057
And that's OK if you're an
accountant, but we're not.

55:44.092 --> 55:49.032
What we look for in a car is, and I'm
loathed to use the word, it's an X factor.

55:49.067 --> 55:51.096
Something you can't really
put your finger on.

55:51.131 --> 55:53.045
And that's what we look for.

55:53.080 --> 55:57.096
Yes. And the Lamborghini has something you can put your finger on
- a stripe.

55:59.064 --> 56:03.048
We're moving on. There's a lot of people
tune in for this moment every year.

56:03.083 --> 56:06.585
Which is clever because
we've never done it before.

56:06.620 --> 56:10.088
It's the Forklift Truck Driver
of the Year award.

56:10.123 --> 56:12.088
The nominations are...

56:12.123 --> 56:13.977
This chap.

56:14.012 --> 56:20.000
Here he is, look. You're all right, back up, you're
all right. Oh, no. Wait a minute, hang on. Ooh!

56:21.000 --> 56:25.080
But the winner without a question
or shadow of doubt is this chap.

56:25.115 --> 56:28.993
Yep, back up, careful, careful...

56:29.028 --> 56:32.024
Ooh, bit quick.
No, ooh, that's not gone well.

56:38.076 --> 56:40.001
Wow! I mean...

56:40.036 --> 56:44.032
Unbelievable... Credit where it's due. A fine effort.

56:45.092 --> 56:50.088
Well, it's appropriate we should now
move on to the Golden Cock award.

56:52.072 --> 56:57.052
This of course, is awarded... Here it
is, Richard demonstrating for you now.

56:57.087 --> 57:00.045
It's awarded to the member
of the Top Gear team who has,

57:00.080 --> 57:03.004
in the course of making
the programme over the year,

57:03.039 --> 57:04.061
been a complete clattering buttock.

57:04.096 --> 57:08.586
Now, there were several cases behind the
scenes this year that we had to consider.

57:08.621 --> 57:13.076
There was the time when James May, whilst
following the Range Rover camera car,

57:13.111 --> 57:16.001
somehow managed to lose
sight of it for a moment

57:16.036 --> 57:19.084
and then start following an
entirely different Range Rover.

57:19.119 --> 57:21.993
And he failed to notice for an hour

57:22.028 --> 57:28.052
that it didn't have a camera crew in it and
was in fact nothing to do with Top Gear at all.

57:28.087 --> 57:32.053
Just to give you an idea of the
degree of James's idiocy there,

57:32.088 --> 57:34.592
here's a picture of a normal
Range Rover. There it is, look.

57:34.627 --> 57:37.096
And now here's a picture of
one of our filming Range Rovers.

57:37.131 --> 57:40.029
There is a giveaway there.

57:40.064 --> 57:43.029
But in the end, there really
could only be one winner.

57:43.064 --> 57:46.061
You may remember the steam train
race we had earlier on in the year.

57:46.096 --> 57:53.008
Well, four minutes before the train was due to leave,
that's four minutes before the race was due to begin,

57:53.043 --> 57:58.048
we were presented with a Jaguar XK with
the keys in the ignition, engine running...

57:58.083 --> 58:01.025
and the doors locked.

58:01.060 --> 58:09.016
So, the Golden Cock has to go to that man who was
trusted to deliver that priceless car on that crucial day,

58:09.051 --> 58:11.032
and left it with us
in that condition.

58:11.067 --> 58:13.096
And that man was...

58:13.131 --> 58:15.045
The Stig!

58:15.080 --> 58:17.040
Yes. Where is he?

58:17.075 --> 58:19.008
He's here.

58:24.048 --> 58:27.024
Stig, the Golden Cock. Yes.

58:28.052 --> 58:30.053
Oh, it's great.
He's touched. He's touched,

58:30.088 --> 58:33.560
I can tell. I should point out,
Stig, that is a rolling award.

58:33.595 --> 58:37.032
We have to have it back now to
give it to next year's winner.

58:37.067 --> 58:38.041
So if I can have that... Ah!

58:38.076 --> 58:41.997
No, you have to give it back so
it sits in our trophy cupboard.

58:42.032 --> 58:47.032
Stig, give me the Golden Cock. Just... Stig,
give me the Gol... Give me the Gol... I need...

58:47.067 --> 58:48.977
Stig, I need the, give me the Gol...

58:49.012 --> 58:53.012
No, not that. Stig, give me the
Golden Cock. Stig, give me the Cock.

58:53.047 --> 58:55.537
We've lost both Cocks.

58:55.572 --> 58:57.993
Have you got his Cock?

58:58.028 --> 59:02.084
Some of it. Yes. It's amazing.
You're joking, is thatall we have left of the Golden...

59:02.119 --> 59:05.001
Oh, mate, it's weird.
He fights like a choirboy

59:05.036 --> 59:09.096
but you can hear his jaws just snapping shut
in his helmet all the time. It's terrifying.

59:09.131 --> 59:11.025
I've got some of it back anyway.

59:11.060 --> 59:14.064
Well, well done, Hammond.
Anyway, that was the Golden Cock.

59:14.099 --> 59:18.033
What I'm doing is I'm blathering. Yeah. You are.

59:18.068 --> 59:22.078
How short can you make anhour-long programme? I don't know.

59:22.113 --> 59:26.580
OK, seriously, honestly, because
James's film was so short,

59:26.615 --> 59:31.013
we do actually have time
for one more award. Yes, we do.

59:31.048 --> 59:36.989
And since this is 2010, we can give
an award to the car of the decade.

59:37.024 --> 59:41.040
Now we are taking this quite seriously.
There are a lot of worthy contenders.

59:41.075 --> 59:45.021
And we considered everything from the
Rolls-Royce Phantom to the new Mini.

59:45.056 --> 59:49.072
Another car that makes our list of those
being considered, Pagani for the Zonda.

59:49.107 --> 59:52.579
Yeah, we also considered,
did we not, the Range Rover TDV8,

59:52.614 --> 59:56.052
simply for being all the car
you could ever possibly need.

59:56.087 --> 59:58.029
And then the light bulb went on,

59:58.064 --> 01:00:02.017
because we realised there could
actually only be one car

01:00:02.052 --> 01:00:06.080
of what the Daily Mail will
undoubtedly call "the noughties".

01:00:06.115 --> 01:00:10.041
It was a car that just
rewrote the rule book, really.

01:00:10.076 --> 01:00:14.544
An amazing piece of engineering.
A genuine Concorde moment.

01:00:14.579 --> 01:00:19.012
So, ladies and gentlemen,
the Top Gear car of the decade

01:00:19.047 --> 01:00:21.012
is the Bugatti Veyron.

01:00:21.047 --> 01:00:24.016
APPLAUSE

01:00:33.036 --> 01:00:35.049
Keep going, keep going.

01:00:35.084 --> 01:00:38.008
Yes. More applause. More than that.

01:00:40.064 --> 01:00:43.012
Yeah! What about that?

01:00:43.047 --> 01:00:45.025
Ha ha!

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:49.004
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:59.004
We're there! We've made it to the
end of the hour. We've done it.

01:00:59.039 --> 01:01:01.013
Thank you so much for watching.

01:01:01.048 --> 01:01:04.092
We'll see you again later in
the year. Have a happy new year.

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:06.080
Take care, everyone. Good night.
