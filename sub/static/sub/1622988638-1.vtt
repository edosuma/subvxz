WEBVTT

00:42.633 --> 00:44.175
Whoa! What is that, yo?

00:47.038 --> 00:49.372
It looks like some kind
of alien spaceship.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.248
Oh, how wonderful.

00:51.383 --> 00:53.849
Perhaps these aliens
are the peaceful kind

00:53.985 --> 00:55.319
that enjoy playing that

00:55.454 --> 00:57.452
song.

00:57.587 --> 00:59.555
If Hollywood movies
have taught me anything,

00:59.691 --> 01:03.220
it's that space aliens
only come here
for one reason,

01:03.356 --> 01:04.456
to replace us!

01:04.591 --> 01:07.928
Well, no alien is replacing me.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.975
Greetings, Earthlings.

01:20.110 --> 01:21.705
We are the Nerdlucks.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.609
Oh, my goodness.
I know these guys.

01:24.745 --> 01:27.785
They're the aliens
from Space Jam.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.385
What's a Space Jam?

01:29.521 --> 01:31.580
It's only the greatest
sports movie of all time.

01:31.716 --> 01:32.715
Sorry. Never heard of it.

01:32.850 --> 01:34.288
-Me neither.
-Nor the I.

01:34.423 --> 01:36.227
How have you never heard of it?

01:36.362 --> 01:39.190
It stars Bugs Bunny
and Michael Jordan.

01:39.325 --> 01:40.466
Michael Jordan?

01:40.601 --> 01:41.891
Oh, yeah.

01:42.027 --> 01:44.132
That's the dude who sells
all them shoes.

01:44.268 --> 01:48.238
Oh, I wish to watch
the movie about the salesman
who plays the basketball.

01:48.373 --> 01:51.435
Well, we happen to own
a copy on VHS.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.475
But our VCR is busted.

01:53.610 --> 01:55.945
No problem.
We've got a VCR in the tower.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.379
We can watch it there.

01:57.515 --> 01:58.576
-Yeah, let's check this out.
-Oh, yeah!

01:58.711 --> 01:59.575
-Excellent!
-Let's do this.

01:59.711 --> 02:01.483
Wait, are you guys crazy?

02:04.385 --> 02:07.993
Inviting these aliens
into our home
is a horrible idea, Titans.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.458
How do we know
we can even trust them?

02:10.593 --> 02:12.527
Just sit down and watch
the movie, dude.

02:18.997 --> 02:21.329
Oh, yeah.
Space Jam!

02:21.465 --> 02:22.306
No.

02:24.302 --> 02:29.511
This is
Teen Titans Go!
See Space Jam.

02:29.647 --> 02:31.612
Now let's fast forward
to get to the good stuff.

02:34.317 --> 02:37.584
I just feel at
this particular time
that I reached the pinnacle

02:37.720 --> 02:40.516
of my basketball career
and I must retire.

02:40.652 --> 02:42.759
Holdup. MJ is retiring?

02:42.894 --> 02:45.490
Nice going, Cyborg.
You skip to the end
of the movie.

02:45.625 --> 02:47.299
Nah, this is the beginning.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.428
But he said he was the done
playing the basketball.

02:50.564 --> 02:52.129
Yeah, he says that a lot.

02:52.264 --> 02:55.198
...anybody this,
except for one person,
and, uh...

02:55.333 --> 02:58.472
but I think I'm gonna go
and play professional baseball.

02:58.608 --> 03:00.136
What position
will you play?

03:00.271 --> 03:02.346
I don't know.
As a kid, I was a pitcher.

03:02.481 --> 03:04.139
I think that'd be kind of hard
for me to pitch,

03:04.275 --> 03:05.877
so I think I'm gonna play
the outfield now.

03:22.636 --> 03:23.894
No way!

03:24.029 --> 03:26.137
There's an amusement park
in space?

03:26.273 --> 03:28.904
And look, it's named
after Robin.

03:29.039 --> 03:30.873
Ha. Very funny.

03:31.008 --> 03:34.708
But mark my words, Titans,
you're all making
a huge mistake.

03:55.133 --> 03:56.697
Woo-hoo!

03:58.735 --> 04:00.996
Let's get out of here, Dad,
this stinks.

04:01.132 --> 04:03.407
Don't bring me
here anymore, all right?

04:03.542 --> 04:05.106
Don't bring me
here anymore, all right?

04:05.241 --> 04:06.569
Are you listening?

04:06.704 --> 04:07.812
Did you hear him?

04:07.947 --> 04:09.309
Did you hear him?

04:09.445 --> 04:11.314
That little brat is right.

04:11.450 --> 04:14.181
I've told you,
if I've told you once...

04:14.317 --> 04:16.086
Yo, that's Danny DeVito.

04:16.221 --> 04:17.952
My dude played The Penguin.

04:18.087 --> 04:21.385
Man, where's Batman.

04:21.520 --> 04:25.797
I told you a thousand,
thousand, thousand,
thousand times!

04:25.933 --> 04:28.427
We need new attractions.

04:28.562 --> 04:29.633
-Right!
-New ones.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.601
Uh-huh.

04:30.737 --> 04:31.629
Get it?

04:31.764 --> 04:32.935
Big, shiny new things. Yeah.

04:33.070 --> 04:34.271
Absolutely, sir.

04:34.407 --> 04:36.231
Look at me.
Look at me and listen.

04:36.366 --> 04:38.941
-The customer is always right.
-

04:39.077 --> 04:39.977
Right.

04:40.112 --> 04:41.570
What is he the doing?

04:41.706 --> 04:43.480
He's smoking.

04:43.615 --> 04:46.608
But smoking is so bad
for you, yo.

04:46.743 --> 04:47.911
Right.

04:48.047 --> 04:49.785
-Okay, we need something--
-Oop!

04:49.921 --> 04:51.147
My bad.

04:51.282 --> 04:52.951
-We need something...
-

04:53.760 --> 04:54.659
Nutty.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.785
Nutty?

04:56.921 --> 04:59.555
I hopes ya'll don't mind,
but I loves counting
butt shots in movies.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.759
That's one.

05:01.895 --> 05:03.932
-Something wacky.
- Wacky.

05:04.068 --> 05:05.929
We need something,
something, something,
something--

05:06.064 --> 05:08.169
-We need something-
-Looney? Oops.

05:08.304 --> 05:09.739
Looney. Thank you.

05:09.875 --> 05:11.101
Looney?

05:13.608 --> 05:15.072
I'm an elk! Shoot me!

05:20.481 --> 05:22.581
Yes! Looney! Yes!

05:22.716 --> 05:25.251
Now you're talking. Looney.

05:25.386 --> 05:29.085
Looney. That's it,
that's the word
I was looking for, Looney.

05:29.220 --> 05:31.620
-Get the Looney Tunes.
-Looney Tunes!

05:31.755 --> 05:32.523
Bring 'em here.

05:32.659 --> 05:35.625
Sir, just noticing, sir.

05:35.761 --> 05:37.363
They're from Earth.

05:37.499 --> 05:38.897
What if they can't come?

05:39.033 --> 05:41.969
What did you say?
What if they can't come?

05:42.105 --> 05:43.700
Uh-huh?

05:43.836 --> 05:45.810
-Make 'em.
-Cool.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.640
Make 'em.

05:47.775 --> 05:49.205
We're gonna get 'em.

05:49.340 --> 05:50.976
We're gonna get 'em.
Yeah, right.

06:00.521 --> 06:02.221
Cyborg's fun fact.

06:02.356 --> 06:05.221
The number 45
was Michael's high school
jersey number.

06:05.964 --> 06:07.394
Strike!

06:09.861 --> 06:11.366
Looks good in a uniform.

06:11.502 --> 06:13.530
Looks great. Can't teach that.

06:13.665 --> 06:14.934
Can't teach it.

06:15.633 --> 06:17.073
Podolak!

06:17.209 --> 06:18.542
Podolak, come here.

06:18.677 --> 06:20.478
-I'm sorry I didn't mean...
-Come here.

06:21.541 --> 06:23.108
Yes, sir?

06:23.243 --> 06:24.881
I want you to make sure
that nobody bothers Michael.

06:25.016 --> 06:26.708
I want him to be
the happiest player
in the world.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.013
The happiest.

06:29.188 --> 06:31.214
Slider. Don't swing.

06:36.524 --> 06:37.858
Strike three!

06:37.994 --> 06:40.496
-I told you not to swing.
-Couldn't help it.

06:40.632 --> 06:42.628
I understand.
Hey, nice talking to ya.

06:50.404 --> 06:53.077
Wow. Everyone's so supportive
of Michael striking out.

06:53.213 --> 06:57.580
I believe they are hoping
to get the free sneakers
from the nice salesman.

06:57.715 --> 06:59.451
We're not worried.
We're not worried.

07:02.383 --> 07:04.748
-Good job, Michael
-Get out there, Michael.
Don't worry.

07:04.883 --> 07:05.783
Good try. Good hustle.

07:05.918 --> 07:08.125
Good cut, Michael. Good cut.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.518
That was a strike out, Mike.
That was a good-looking
strike out. Real good.

07:10.653 --> 07:12.189
I mean, you look good
when you strike out, man.

07:12.324 --> 07:13.956
When I strike out, man,
it looks nasty, man.

07:14.091 --> 07:15.434
At least you look good, man.

07:17.465 --> 07:19.064
Hi, Mr. Jordan.

07:19.997 --> 07:21.730
Mr. Jordan, I'm Stan--

07:26.243 --> 07:27.446
Ow, jeez.

07:31.716 --> 07:34.144
You all right?
That was a nasty fall.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.914
Yeah. Oh, I'm Stan Podolak,
Mr. Jordan

07:38.050 --> 07:40.019
I'm the Barons' new publicist.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.257
I'm here to make
your life easier.

07:43.393 --> 07:45.160
You want me
to drive you somewhere,
I will drive you anywhere.

07:45.295 --> 07:47.063
You want me to pick up
your laundry,
babysit your kids,

07:47.199 --> 07:48.364
I will do it.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.260
I knew I recognized that dude.

07:50.395 --> 07:52.997
That's that fool
from Jurassic Park, yo.

07:53.132 --> 07:55.670
I am here
to personally guarantee

07:55.806 --> 07:58.510
that no one
will ever bother you.

08:04.617 --> 08:07.512
Friends, look.
It is the Santy Claus.

08:07.647 --> 08:09.312
Ho, ho, ho.

08:12.488 --> 08:13.525
What was that?

08:19.097 --> 08:20.130
Hang on.

08:20.265 --> 08:23.162
Hanging on.

08:23.297 --> 08:25.266
Why is Looney Tunes
in the center of the Earth?

08:25.402 --> 08:28.196
Because it's
the looniest place
the writers could think of.

08:28.332 --> 08:30.366
-Oh. Whatever.

08:33.807 --> 08:35.837
-Bombastic.
-Cool.

08:46.454 --> 08:48.853
All right,
you irascible bunny.
Come back.

08:48.988 --> 08:50.858
Ho, ho. There's my man Bugs.

08:50.993 --> 08:52.696
I'll be with you
in a second, folks,

08:52.831 --> 08:55.632
after I finish
with nature boy here. Oop.

08:55.768 --> 08:59.329
All right, pesky wabbit.
I've got you now.

09:00.569 --> 09:02.667
Here's a fun fact.

09:02.802 --> 09:05.203
Bugs Bunny got his name
when legendary animator
"Ben-Bugs" Hardaway

09:05.339 --> 09:07.203
drew a sketch of a rabbit
which got labeled

09:07.339 --> 09:09.647
by his fellow coworkers
as Bugs' Bunny.

09:09.782 --> 09:11.550
And Elmer Fudd
was originally named Egghead.

09:13.019 --> 09:13.948
Ouch.

09:15.318 --> 09:16.214
Hmm.

09:18.786 --> 09:21.718
One small step for moi!

09:21.854 --> 09:24.856
Moi!
- One giant leap
for Moron Mountain!

09:24.992 --> 09:27.355
-

09:27.491 --> 09:30.129
And one whopper headache
for Elmer Fudd.

09:34.505 --> 09:36.370
Diminutive. Ain't they?

09:36.505 --> 09:39.407
-We seek the one
they call Bugs Bunny.
-Yeah, Bugs Bunny.

09:39.542 --> 09:40.375
Have you seen him?

09:40.510 --> 09:41.410
Where is this guy?

09:41.545 --> 09:43.411
Is he around?

09:43.546 --> 09:45.575
Hmm... Bugs Bunny.

09:45.711 --> 09:50.120
Bugs Bunny.
Say, does he have great,
big long ears?

09:50.255 --> 09:51.420
Like this?

09:51.555 --> 09:53.084
Yeah.

09:53.220 --> 09:56.089
And does he hop around
like this?

09:59.332 --> 10:00.832
Yeah.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.459
Well, does he say,
"What's up, Doc?"
like this?

10:05.430 --> 10:07.634
Eh... What's up, Doc?

10:07.769 --> 10:08.833
Yeah.

10:08.969 --> 10:10.999
Nope, never heard of him.

10:11.135 --> 10:13.645
Aw!

10:13.780 --> 10:16.338
You know, maybe there is
no intelligent life

10:16.474 --> 10:18.441
out there in
the universe after all.

10:22.722 --> 10:25.957
Hold on there,
Mr. Looney Tune.

10:26.093 --> 10:29.889
Ah-ha! Even more proof
that these Nerdlucks
are evil!

10:30.024 --> 10:31.656
Ah, Bugs kinda had that coming.

10:31.791 --> 10:33.088
Okay, bunny.

10:33.224 --> 10:35.390
Gather up your Tune pals.

10:35.526 --> 10:38.727
We're taking you
for a ride.

10:38.863 --> 10:41.365
So, like, where we goin'?

10:46.279 --> 10:48.212
Are we there yet?

10:48.347 --> 10:50.045
Ah, I'm really sorry
it took so long, but,
you know...

10:50.181 --> 10:52.083
Sherm, Sherm,
don't, don't worry about it.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.408
...that exit on 65
wasn't clearly marked.
It was like--

10:53.544 --> 10:54.984
Hold.
Hold on. Right here.

10:55.119 --> 10:55.513
What, here?
- Yes. Right here.

10:55.649 --> 10:56.452
Oh.

10:56.587 --> 10:57.886
So that's MJ's house?

10:58.021 --> 11:00.483
He must make the modest
of the salaries.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.153
Thanks for the ride, Sherm.
I appreciate it.

11:02.288 --> 11:04.491
-It's Stan, Mike.
-I'm sorry.

11:04.626 --> 11:06.454
But that's all right.
You can call me
Sherm if you want to.

11:06.590 --> 11:08.695
Because I followed
your whole career

11:08.831 --> 11:09.630
-and I just think you're
the greatest athlete that's...
-Stan! Stan, Stan, Stan.

11:09.765 --> 11:11.065
...that's ever lived.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.166
Gimme that remote!
I wanna see more Bugs.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.009
Stop the music!

11:23.145 --> 11:24.976
-Top duck comin' through!
-Hey!

11:25.111 --> 11:27.013
Jeez! It's gettin' so a guy

11:27.149 --> 11:28.881
can't even get himself
wet around here!

11:29.017 --> 11:31.682
So, what's the big emergency?

11:31.817 --> 11:34.390
Uh, these little guys would
like to make an announcement.

11:34.526 --> 11:36.024
Here you go, shorty.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.155
-All right. All right.

11:38.291 --> 11:41.860
You, all of you,

11:41.995 --> 11:44.559
are now our prisoners!

11:44.695 --> 11:47.299
See! I told you they
want to abduct us!

11:50.008 --> 11:54.736
Ooh!
We're in big trouble now.

11:54.871 --> 11:58.039
We are taking you to our
theme park in outer space.

11:58.174 --> 11:59.175
No fooling.

11:59.310 --> 12:00.719
Where you will be our slaves

12:00.854 --> 12:03.012
and placed on display
for the amusement

12:03.148 --> 12:04.381
of our paying customers.

12:04.517 --> 12:08.351
Oh, fear clutches
my breast.

12:08.487 --> 12:11.253
Okay. If these Nerdlucks
are so friendly,

12:11.388 --> 12:13.191
then why is Bugs chained up?

12:13.327 --> 12:15.066
He's just doing
a little street magic.

12:15.202 --> 12:18.502
But they just called all
of the Looney Tunes
their prisoners!

12:18.638 --> 12:20.233
It's all part of the act, yo.

12:20.368 --> 12:23.597
I don't know.
Something smells fishy...

12:23.733 --> 12:25.601
That would be
your breath, Robin.

12:28.042 --> 12:31.409
We ain't a-goin' nowheres!

12:32.813 --> 12:34.181
Whoa guns!

12:34.316 --> 12:36.084
How bouts we make this
a bit more kid friendly?

12:37.621 --> 12:38.548
That's better.

12:39.588 --> 12:40.517
Oh.

12:44.387 --> 12:46.730
Eh, not so fast, doc.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.695
You just can't turn us
into slaves,

12:48.830 --> 12:50.363
that would be bad.

12:50.499 --> 12:52.402
You've gotta give us
a chance to defend ourselves.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.903
Oh, yeah? Who says?

12:55.038 --> 12:56.065
Says who?
- Why?

12:56.201 --> 12:57.303
That's another one!

12:59.577 --> 13:00.940
Just a sec.

13:01.076 --> 13:03.314
There! Read em and weep, boys.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.882
What's this?

13:05.018 --> 13:07.582
"Give them a chance
to defend themselves."

13:07.718 --> 13:09.653
Do we have to?

13:09.788 --> 13:11.049
-It's in the rule book.
-It is.

13:11.185 --> 13:13.383
Okay. It is in the rule book.

13:13.519 --> 13:16.289
Uno momento!
We have to confer.

13:18.892 --> 13:20.460
Cyborg fun fact.

13:20.595 --> 13:22.795
This scene is a reference
to the 1970 movie, Patton,

13:22.931 --> 13:23.997
which won Best Picture.

13:24.133 --> 13:26.097
But do you know
which 2018 movie

13:26.233 --> 13:27.762
should have won best picture?

13:30.905 --> 13:32.608
All right, troops.

13:32.743 --> 13:34.502
It is for us to choose

13:34.637 --> 13:36.480
a battlefield that affords us--

13:36.616 --> 13:38.042
I got it.

13:38.177 --> 13:40.878
Yes, Private Porkster?

13:41.013 --> 13:45.417
How
about we challenge
them to a spelling bee?

13:45.552 --> 13:48.985
Say... We could have
a bowling tournament.

13:50.956 --> 13:54.288
Sufferin' Succotash!
What's wrong with all of ya?

13:54.424 --> 13:55.824
I say, we get a ladder,

13:55.959 --> 13:58.262
wait till the old lady's
outta the room,

13:58.397 --> 14:00.869
then grab that little bird.

14:01.004 --> 14:02.835
-Whoa! Whoa!

14:02.971 --> 14:05.172
Take a deep breath, Sly!

14:05.307 --> 14:07.675
Okay, let's analyze
the competition.

14:07.811 --> 14:09.011
Hmm. That's a good idea.

14:09.147 --> 14:11.009
Now, uh, what are
we lookin' at here?

14:11.144 --> 14:12.477
Let's see.

14:12.612 --> 14:14.149
We got a small race
of invading aliens.

14:15.181 --> 14:18.214
Small arms! Short legs!

14:18.350 --> 14:20.083
-Not very fast.
-Hmm.

14:20.218 --> 14:21.820
Tiny little guys.

14:21.955 --> 14:24.554
Can't jump high.

14:24.690 --> 14:26.929
Hey! They's just
described you, Robin.

14:27.065 --> 14:28.431
Very funny.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.968
Uh-huh.

14:33.369 --> 14:36.871
We challenge you
to a basketball game.

14:37.006 --> 14:39.369
All right. Basketball it is!

14:39.504 --> 14:41.942
-Basketball!
-Oh boy, oh boy.

14:42.078 --> 14:44.847
All right! What is basketball?

14:44.982 --> 14:46.379
-What's that?
-Beats me.

14:46.515 --> 14:47.242
-We didn't have that in school.
-I have no idea.

14:47.377 --> 14:48.453
-What?
-Lights!

14:48.588 --> 14:50.421
Pardon me! Oop, sorry.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.552
Hey! Down in front!

14:55.358 --> 14:58.286
An exhilarating
team sport currently growing
rapidly in popularity...

14:58.422 --> 14:59.854
And the game is on!

15:01.191 --> 15:02.593
No good!

15:02.729 --> 15:04.200
Over here! Over here!
Over here! Over here!

15:04.335 --> 15:07.367
And nothing! Still can't
get it in the basket. Man!

15:07.502 --> 15:09.369
Looks like the crowd
is having none of it.

15:10.335 --> 15:13.073
From downtown... Boom!

15:13.208 --> 15:15.045
...Association.

15:15.181 --> 15:18.047
Featuring the best players
in the world!

15:18.183 --> 15:21.381
-The best players in the world.
-The best!

15:40.700 --> 15:42.039
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.166
I'm so sorry.
- Sorry.

15:43.301 --> 15:45.339
Excuse me.

15:45.474 --> 15:47.371
Ouch!
Get your feet out of my nose!

15:47.506 --> 15:49.206
Be quiet,
they're looking!

15:49.341 --> 15:51.906
Hey! It's basketball.

15:52.917 --> 15:55.382
-Where?
-Whoa! Now what?

15:59.085 --> 16:00.316
Hey hey!

16:00.452 --> 16:02.124
Fun Fact. Patricia Heaton

16:02.260 --> 16:03.825
starred on the sitcom,
The Middle,

16:03.961 --> 16:05.226
which was filmed next door

16:05.361 --> 16:06.922
to the offices
of Teen Titans Go!

16:07.057 --> 16:08.761
What? What?
- She's looking again.

16:08.896 --> 16:10.296
Close it up!
Close it up!
- Tightly.

16:10.432 --> 16:12.630
You poked me again.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.306
-Sweetheart.
-What?

16:16.441 --> 16:17.599
I thought you were gonna
get better seats this year.

16:17.734 --> 16:18.971
This is as good as I could get.

16:19.107 --> 16:20.573
This guy next to me

16:20.708 --> 16:22.336
is doing something
very weird in his raincoat.

16:22.472 --> 16:24.039
Pop quiz time.

16:24.175 --> 16:27.280
Dan Castellaneta is the voice
of which famous TV dummy?

16:27.416 --> 16:30.786
If you guessed Robin
you'd be wrong!

16:30.922 --> 16:32.518
Robin isn't famous at all.

16:32.653 --> 16:34.119
Honey, will you just
let me watch the game?

16:34.254 --> 16:36.090
Barkley's killing us!

16:36.225 --> 16:38.495
Hey! Someone's killing someone.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.191
No. Seriously?

16:40.327 --> 16:43.001
Wow! A killer! Let me see!

16:45.267 --> 16:47.170
There! That's him. The killer.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.273
He's big.
-He's good.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.536
He's mine!

16:53.671 --> 16:54.868
Okay.
Go get him!

16:55.004 --> 16:56.711
Yeah!
Watch out!

16:56.846 --> 16:57.510
- Hey!
Watch it!

17:07.322 --> 17:08.517
Come on. Get back on defense.

17:08.652 --> 17:09.851
Why isn't the crowd shocked

17:09.987 --> 17:11.525
that he just got
an alien up his nose?

17:11.661 --> 17:14.091
You can't shock these people,
they're New Yorkers!

17:17.198 --> 17:18.135
What are you doing?

17:26.978 --> 17:29.708
Time out! Call the time out!

17:29.843 --> 17:32.382
What's wrong with you, man?
You're killin' us.

17:32.518 --> 17:33.880
Let him in!
Let him in!
- Open up!

17:34.015 --> 17:35.211
Open!

17:35.346 --> 17:37.546
Wow! He did it.

17:37.681 --> 17:41.392
I got it! I got his talent.

17:41.527 --> 17:42.719
Super.

17:42.855 --> 17:44.058
-Sit down, Chuck.
-Hey, man. I'm fine!

17:44.194 --> 17:46.087
-Charles.
-I am fine!

17:46.223 --> 17:47.756
No, no, no, no! I'm playing
you too many minutes.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.265
-I'm not tired!
-Go get the doctor.

17:59.902 --> 18:00.777
What's up, baby? You all right?

18:00.912 --> 18:01.874
-Yeah, man.
-Sure?

18:02.009 --> 18:02.806
Yeah.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.745
Come on, we're okay.
You're okay.

18:05.881 --> 18:07.085
-You're all right.
Come on, let's go.
-Yeah, man.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.713
He catches the ball
like friend Robin!

18:12.849 --> 18:15.724
With the baby hands!

18:20.495 --> 18:22.100
Come on, Patrick.
It's showtime!

18:24.099 --> 18:25.400
You guys suck!

18:32.072 --> 18:32.968
Popcorn!

18:36.044 --> 18:37.110
Okay. Okay.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.477
Now, which of you maroons

18:38.612 --> 18:40.314
has ever played
basketball before?

18:40.450 --> 18:42.147
-I have, Coach.

18:42.283 --> 18:43.516
And there's an important

18:43.651 --> 18:45.413
strategic question
I need to ask you.

18:45.548 --> 18:46.520
Yes, yes?

18:50.928 --> 18:52.395
What do you think?

18:52.530 --> 18:54.261
I'm kind of partial
to purple and gold myself.

18:54.397 --> 18:56.327
It goes better
with my coloring.

18:56.463 --> 18:59.802
-A-one, two, three, four.
Disco disco duck!
-Guys! Nice outfit, Daffy.

18:59.938 --> 19:03.871
The little
aliens say it's their turn
to use the court.

19:04.006 --> 19:05.441
Yeah, sure.

19:05.576 --> 19:07.839
Let the little pipsqueaks
knock themselves out.

19:07.974 --> 19:10.911
Too bad you can't practice
getting taller, boys.

19:18.988 --> 19:20.382
Whoooa!

19:25.257 --> 19:26.626
Ah!

19:50.521 --> 19:52.349
Holds up!
So you guys have the ability

19:52.485 --> 19:53.783
to steal our talents

19:53.919 --> 19:55.483
and turn into monster
versions of us?

19:55.619 --> 19:56.819
That's right.

19:56.955 --> 19:58.494
Then what are
you the waiting for?

19:58.630 --> 20:00.922
Yeah, we want to see
what you guys look like as us.

20:01.058 --> 20:03.695
No, no, no.
This is a terrible--

20:03.830 --> 20:05.593
Nah, don't listen to him.
Go for it!

20:05.729 --> 20:07.403
Okay, if you say so.

20:15.805 --> 20:18.913
Whoa! Booyah, dude!

20:20.249 --> 20:23.579
Azarath Metrion Zinthos!

20:28.818 --> 20:31.456
This is the amazing...

20:31.591 --> 20:34.894
Ha-ha! Huh? Hey! What gives?

20:35.030 --> 20:38.027
Why do they have cool new
talents and I don't have any?

20:38.162 --> 20:40.698
That's 'cause
you got stuck with Robin

20:40.834 --> 20:43.272
and he ain't
gots no talent.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.903
I do too have talent.
Check this out.

20:46.038 --> 20:49.537
And slide, eeeyyy, ooh-ooh,
hooma-chaaa!

20:51.511 --> 20:52.710
Dude, you gotta stop.

20:52.846 --> 20:54.483
Let's just get back
to the movie.

20:56.713 --> 20:57.849
Hey, little pig...

20:59.091 --> 21:00.522
-Boo.
-

21:02.292 --> 21:03.585
I wet myself.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.061
Time to play
a little basketball.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.436
Those little pipsqueaks
just turned into superstars!

21:17.572 --> 21:20.343
They're monsters!

21:20.479 --> 21:24.509
Sufferin Succotash!
They're monstars!

21:24.645 --> 21:26.917
See, Titans? They're monsters!

21:27.052 --> 21:29.418
No, they're Monstars.

21:29.554 --> 21:31.213
That's like a whole
letter difference.

21:31.348 --> 21:34.292
Eh, I think we might
need a little bit of help.

21:35.995 --> 21:36.960
Okay, little fella.

21:37.095 --> 21:38.862
Hey, it's Bill Murray!

21:38.998 --> 21:40.130
I love Bill Murray.

21:40.266 --> 21:42.892
-That dude's my hero, yo!
-Hero?

21:43.028 --> 21:45.099
But he does not
have the superpower.

21:45.234 --> 21:46.601
Oh, yes, he does.

21:46.736 --> 21:49.263
Bill Murray's superpower
is being Bill Murray.

21:50.638 --> 21:53.834
You my friend, or you my enemy?

21:53.970 --> 21:55.339
You are my friend, right?

21:55.474 --> 21:56.805
You are my ally.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.772
Classic Jordan versus Bird!

21:58.908 --> 22:00.080
That dude's a bird?

22:00.216 --> 22:01.610
Now I see it!

22:01.745 --> 22:02.912
Draw the feathers

22:03.048 --> 22:04.816
and there's
the very large beak!

22:04.952 --> 22:07.948
But I'm not sure
how he lays the eggs.

22:08.083 --> 22:09.386
Larry Bird doesn't lay eggs.

22:09.521 --> 22:10.394
He lay-ups!

22:12.460 --> 22:13.590
You are my associate,

22:13.725 --> 22:14.931
my personal assistant.

22:15.066 --> 22:16.690
You are my weapon.

22:16.825 --> 22:17.797
You are leaving.

22:18.904 --> 22:20.195
Oh.

22:20.330 --> 22:21.871
-Great shot.
-Oh, nice shot, Mr. Murray.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.710
Cyborg's Fun Fact.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.711
Bill Murray's hat was invented
in 1880 by Robert W. Patton!

22:29.847 --> 22:32.477
Who used to predict weather
for The Seattle Times.

22:35.321 --> 22:37.311
-Good try.
-Not bad. Not bad.

22:37.446 --> 22:38.750
Something for you all
to shoot at.

22:38.886 --> 22:40.853
-Hit it good, Larry.
-Do my best.

22:42.820 --> 22:43.856
It was a good shot.

22:44.689 --> 22:46.725
Yeah, I know.

22:46.861 --> 22:48.131
Mike, I gotta
ask you something.

22:48.266 --> 22:49.994
The NBA has to face reality.

22:50.129 --> 22:52.095
What's happening
to these players is serious.

22:52.231 --> 22:55.030
They're gonna
need new players with talent,

22:55.165 --> 22:58.541
guys who are skilled, but
never really thought about
a professional career before.

23:00.937 --> 23:02.303
You think I got a shot?

23:04.444 --> 23:05.312
Come on, really?

23:05.448 --> 23:06.880
-No.
-Don't kid me.

23:07.015 --> 23:10.681
Listen, it's a man's game,
and you can't play.

23:10.816 --> 23:12.347
What if I tried really hard?

23:12.483 --> 23:14.555
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to hit this ball.

23:14.690 --> 23:16.390
It's because I'm white,
isn't it?

23:16.525 --> 23:18.757
No. Larry's white. So what?

23:18.893 --> 23:21.432
Larry's not white,
Larry's clear.

23:23.897 --> 23:24.858
-Good shot, Larry.
-That far?

23:24.994 --> 23:26.536
Get inside of this ball.

23:27.869 --> 23:30.536
Ooh, you clowns
can't beat that.

23:30.672 --> 23:32.206
It's the best shot I ever hit.

23:32.342 --> 23:35.376
Ugh, golf is so boring.

23:35.511 --> 23:37.442
Well, of course it's boring.

23:37.577 --> 23:40.150
The movie's got NBA players,
space aliens
and the Looney Tunes.

23:40.285 --> 23:43.412
If they made the scene any more
exciting, the audience's
head would explode.

23:43.548 --> 23:46.117
You feel that the NBA has
to face reality, don't you?

23:46.253 --> 23:48.215
Just gotta start looking
for some more dominant players

23:48.351 --> 23:49.620
in places they
never looked before.

23:49.755 --> 23:51.054
Just look at the ball.

23:51.190 --> 23:52.787
Visualize the shot
where you want it to go.

23:52.923 --> 23:54.095
Right, right, right.

23:54.230 --> 23:55.598
Be the ball.

23:55.733 --> 23:57.267
-Be the ball.
- Get off the tee.

23:57.402 --> 23:58.634
-Why?
- You can't jump.

24:00.764 --> 24:02.231
I-- Yeah. Go on.

24:02.998 --> 24:04.132
Close to the pin.

24:04.268 --> 24:06.107
Close to the pin,
for dinner?

24:06.242 --> 24:07.872
Sounds good.
- I'll go close
to the pin.

24:08.008 --> 24:09.579
Okay.
-I'll take some of that.

24:12.547 --> 24:14.151
That's not bad.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.512
It's a good shot.

24:15.647 --> 24:16.685
Get down!

24:18.552 --> 24:19.655
Look at that spin.

24:27.929 --> 24:29.995
Hey. Since when
are golf balls magnetic?

24:31.398 --> 24:32.360
Come on.

24:34.963 --> 24:36.474
It is alive!

24:41.804 --> 24:45.041
My first hole in one. Yes!
-

24:45.177 --> 24:46.974
Oh!
- Don't say it.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.178
You ever see this before?

24:48.954 --> 24:50.178
Larry?

24:50.314 --> 24:52.153
Nothing but the bottom
of the cup.

24:52.288 --> 24:55.351
Oh, God,
that's his ball.
-Yeah, yeah, it's my ball.

24:55.486 --> 24:57.660
-Sorry.
-Wait, wait.
Let me get a picture.

24:57.795 --> 24:59.723
All right, here we go.
You're gonna smile.

24:59.858 --> 25:01.856
You're reaching--
You're reaching for the ball
and then you smile.

25:01.992 --> 25:03.167
-Okay?
-Yes.

25:03.302 --> 25:04.934
And you think this is good.

25:05.069 --> 25:05.866
Just take the picture!
-All right, okay.

25:07.599 --> 25:08.506
Uh-oh.

25:16.108 --> 25:17.805
What kind of camera
is that?

25:17.941 --> 25:19.341
-Just a regular--
-Would you not point that
at me please?

25:19.477 --> 25:20.775
-And close the lens cap.
-I didn't do anything--

25:20.911 --> 25:21.809
Where'd he go?

25:24.114 --> 25:28.854
Fun fact...The temperature
at the center of the Earth
is 9,800 degrees.

25:28.990 --> 25:30.660
No, no, no, no!

25:43.372 --> 25:46.874
Oh, look out for that
first step, doc.
It's a real lulu.

25:47.640 --> 25:49.073
Bugs Bunny?

25:49.209 --> 25:51.338
Eh, you were expecting
maybe the Easter Bunny?

25:51.474 --> 25:52.840
You're a cartoon.
You're not real.

25:52.976 --> 25:54.077
Not real, eh?

25:54.212 --> 25:56.581
If I weren't real,
could I do this?

26:01.184 --> 26:02.752
Oh, look. Is that Michael?

26:04.694 --> 26:06.320
Why is Sylvester in the sewer?

26:06.456 --> 26:07.994
He's getting ready
to ambush Tweety.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.534
Bah!

26:11.670 --> 26:13.564
Okay, but why is Taz
in the mailbox?

26:13.700 --> 26:16.738
Because Tasmanian devils
are the number one cause
of mail tampering.

26:16.874 --> 26:19.032
Come on, Raven.
This isn't rocket science.

26:19.167 --> 26:20.869
Basketball!

26:21.005 --> 26:23.237
Ooh! I thought I saw...

26:23.373 --> 26:25.748
I did.
I did see Michael Jordan.

26:26.748 --> 26:28.351
Eh, pardon me, Mr. Jordan.

26:31.082 --> 26:32.247
Your John Hancock, please?

26:32.383 --> 26:34.823
Back off! Let the doctor
take a look.

26:36.556 --> 26:37.720
Woops!

26:37.856 --> 26:38.921
A little high.

26:39.057 --> 26:40.596
-No.
-Going down.

26:40.732 --> 26:44.096
- No!

26:45.195 --> 26:48.166
-Oh!
-

26:48.301 --> 26:51.268
So... what do you say
we go for a little spin?

26:52.143 --> 26:53.204
Yes.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.304
Hmm.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.311
Now, let's see what we got
inside here.

26:59.845 --> 27:01.278
Say "ah".

27:03.320 --> 27:04.351
All right.

27:04.486 --> 27:05.821
He's okay!

27:07.392 --> 27:08.725
What's going on here?

27:08.860 --> 27:11.387
Why, Michael,
I thought you'd never ask.

27:11.523 --> 27:13.390
You see, these aliens
come from outer space

27:13.525 --> 27:15.594
and they want to make us slaves
in their theme park.

27:15.730 --> 27:17.595
Eh, what do we care?

27:17.730 --> 27:19.836
They're little.
So we challenge them
to a basketball game.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.628
But then they show up
and they ain't so little.

27:21.763 --> 27:24.266
They're huge!
We need to beat these guys,

27:24.401 --> 27:25.808
because they're talking
about slavery.

27:25.943 --> 27:27.502
They're going to make us
do stand-up comedy,

27:27.638 --> 27:30.345
the same jokes every night
for all eternity.

27:30.481 --> 27:32.047
What's he whining about?

27:32.182 --> 27:34.511
I know comedians
who would love that kind
of job security.

27:34.646 --> 27:38.486
Entertainment is indeed
the toughest of
the businesses.

27:38.622 --> 27:41.620
We're gonna be locked up
like wild animals and then
trotted out to perform

27:41.755 --> 27:46.530
for a bunch of low-brow,
bug-eyed, fat-headed,
humor-challenged aliens!

27:46.666 --> 27:49.298
Eh, what I'm trying
to say is...

27:49.433 --> 27:52.394
We need your help!

27:52.529 --> 27:54.033
Yeah, but I'm
a baseball player now.

27:54.168 --> 27:57.499
Right. And I'm
a Shakespearean actor.

28:04.315 --> 28:05.705
Stop the movie!

28:05.841 --> 28:08.378
If I laugh any harder,
I's gonna pee myself.

28:09.847 --> 28:11.149
Oops.

28:11.285 --> 28:13.482
That Bugs Bunny
is pretty loony.

28:13.618 --> 28:16.819
You want to see loony?
We'll show you loony.

28:45.319 --> 28:46.981
You guys want to watch
more of the movie?

28:47.116 --> 28:47.989
Yeah!

28:51.856 --> 28:53.021
Mike?

28:53.157 --> 28:54.930
Michael, it's Stan.

28:55.730 --> 28:56.930
It's Stan Podolak.

28:57.066 --> 28:59.429
Look, I need you
to come out now, okay?

28:59.565 --> 29:01.695
Because you've got
a baseball game tomorrow.

29:01.831 --> 29:04.005
I'd look pretty stupid
if you don't show up.

29:05.875 --> 29:07.105
You think Michael's all right?

29:07.241 --> 29:08.542
Boy, I hate
to leave him like this.

29:08.678 --> 29:10.277
I'm sure he's fine.

29:10.413 --> 29:12.780
I think he just had to get away
from that Stan character.

29:12.915 --> 29:15.248
Oh, God.
He's pathetic, isn't he?

29:15.384 --> 29:17.585
Larry, I'm going to give us
both twos back there.

29:17.721 --> 29:20.684
-We weren't in any kind
of emotional state to putt.
-I think that's fair.

29:20.819 --> 29:22.054
Yeah.

29:22.190 --> 29:24.756
Come on, Larry Bird!
To the Batcave!

29:31.833 --> 29:35.569
Look, I want to help, but
I haven't played basketball
in a long time.

29:35.705 --> 29:36.670
My timing's all off.

29:36.806 --> 29:38.341
Eh, we'll fix your timing.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.133
Look at our facilities.

29:40.268 --> 29:41.735
We've got hoops.

29:42.778 --> 29:44.309
We got weights.

29:45.009 --> 29:46.776
We've got balls.

29:46.911 --> 29:47.745
Whoa!

29:47.880 --> 29:48.814
You sure do.

29:48.949 --> 29:50.282
This place is a mess.

29:50.417 --> 29:52.684
Mess? You're worried
about a little mess?

29:52.819 --> 29:56.450
There's nothing here
a little spit-shine
wouldn't fix.

29:56.585 --> 29:58.653
-Spit-shine!
-Spit-shine!

30:00.464 --> 30:02.665
Remember, kids,

30:02.800 --> 30:05.066
when your parents tell you
to clean your room, just
give it the old spit-shine.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.580
Lemony fresh.

30:19.715 --> 30:21.082
You guys are nuts.

30:21.217 --> 30:24.347
Correction.
We're Looney Tunes.

30:24.483 --> 30:26.381
And as such are
the exclusive property

30:26.516 --> 30:29.491
and trademark of
Warner Bros Inc.

30:29.627 --> 30:31.455
Ha-ha! Another butt!

30:32.957 --> 30:34.088
Mmuah!

30:41.703 --> 30:43.302
I'm here.

30:44.375 --> 30:45.733
Me, too.

30:47.005 --> 30:48.175
That hurt.

30:50.780 --> 30:52.280
Who are these guys?

30:52.416 --> 30:55.853
Well, uh,
remember the tiny aliens
I told you about?

30:56.849 --> 30:57.851
Oh.

30:57.986 --> 30:59.548
You heard of the Dream Team?

30:59.683 --> 31:02.490
Well, we're the Mean Team,
wussy man.

31:02.625 --> 31:03.826
Wussy man.

31:03.962 --> 31:05.854
-"Wussy man"?
-We're the Monstars!

31:05.990 --> 31:07.696
M-O-N--

31:07.832 --> 31:10.494
Let's see what you got, chump.

31:11.728 --> 31:13.432
I don't play
basketball anymore.

31:13.567 --> 31:16.104
"I don't play
basketball anymore."

31:17.202 --> 31:18.903
Maybe you're chicken.

31:20.713 --> 31:23.369
I say, I resemble that remark.

31:23.505 --> 31:24.644
You calling me chicken?

31:24.779 --> 31:26.615
Hey, come here.

31:26.750 --> 31:29.583
-Whoa!
-

31:32.254 --> 31:33.918
That's gonna
give me nightmares.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.317
Ooh! Watch the footwork.

31:37.453 --> 31:39.219
Can you believe it?

31:39.354 --> 31:40.386
Whoa!

31:40.522 --> 31:42.794
Get out of the way!

31:45.535 --> 31:46.392
Ah!

31:46.528 --> 31:48.538
Hey, everybody!

31:48.673 --> 31:51.441
Look at your hero now.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.710
You guys
are making a big mistake.

31:56.846 --> 31:58.438
You're all washed up...

31:58.573 --> 32:01.546
-Baldy.
-"Baldy"?

32:01.681 --> 32:04.411
He's not washed up.
Michael's the greatest ever.

32:04.547 --> 32:06.181
-Shut up.
-Doh!

32:09.661 --> 32:11.856
My poor little cranium.

32:11.991 --> 32:12.957
You okay?

32:13.093 --> 32:14.728
Yeah. Are you okay?

32:14.863 --> 32:16.564
-Hey!
-Whoops.

32:16.699 --> 32:20.597
You're not scared of them,
are you, Michael?

32:30.078 --> 32:31.140
Let's play some basketball

32:31.276 --> 32:32.246
Yeah!

32:36.885 --> 32:38.314
What do you doing?

32:38.450 --> 32:40.617
I'm, uh... I'm fixing a divot.

32:41.393 --> 32:42.223
Oh.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.028
He's fixing a divot.

32:51.801 --> 32:55.128
Fun fact... Schlesinger Gym
was named after
Leon Schlesinger,

32:55.264 --> 32:57.439
who was the original producer
of The Looney Tunes,

32:57.574 --> 33:00.835
and the gym is modeled
after a Warner Brothers
soundstage.

33:26.137 --> 33:28.432
Has anyone here
ever played basketball?

33:28.568 --> 33:31.237
-Um, I have...
-

33:31.373 --> 33:33.208
I'd like to try out
for the team.

33:34.039 --> 33:34.974
Hey.

33:35.110 --> 33:37.039
Hi. My name is Lola Bunny.

33:37.174 --> 33:38.679
Lola?

33:38.815 --> 33:40.174
Yes?

33:40.309 --> 33:41.445
Hello.

33:41.580 --> 33:43.620
Eh, my name is...
Bugs.

33:43.755 --> 33:46.985
-You wanna play
a little one-on-one, doll?

33:47.120 --> 33:48.856
-"Doll"?
-Uh-huh.

33:48.991 --> 33:52.054
On the court... Bugs.

33:52.189 --> 33:53.621
Sure.

33:53.756 --> 33:55.989
-Oh, she's hot.
-

33:58.131 --> 34:00.070
-Ready?
-Yes.

34:01.997 --> 34:06.534
-I got it, I got it--
-

34:06.669 --> 34:08.243
The girl's got some skills.

34:10.174 --> 34:11.510
Yes?

34:14.446 --> 34:17.414
Don't ever call me "doll."

34:17.549 --> 34:19.920
Indeed, she is not one of these

34:20.056 --> 34:22.224
or these, or any of these.

34:24.225 --> 34:25.590
-Check.
-

34:27.756 --> 34:30.292
Hey, nice playing with ya.

34:30.427 --> 34:32.458
She's... leaving?

34:32.594 --> 34:34.532
Yeah! Because one single basket
automatically gets you
on the team.

34:34.668 --> 34:36.269
Well, no wonder
they need Michael so bad.

34:36.405 --> 34:37.734
-Mais oui!
-Okay. Where's the ball?

34:40.402 --> 34:43.542
-Let's do some drills.
- Yeah,
let's do that.

34:47.417 --> 34:49.442
Can anyone lend me
a pair of sneakers?

34:49.578 --> 34:51.253
Uh, sneakers?

34:54.289 --> 34:56.223
Oh.
-Sowwy.

34:56.359 --> 34:57.828
Someone's gonna
have to go to my house

34:57.963 --> 34:59.459
and pick up my basketball gear.

34:59.595 --> 35:02.989
-To your house?
In 3-D land?
- Yeah.

35:03.124 --> 35:06.230
Would somebody
get this guy a mask? Ugh.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.599
And whatever you do...

35:08.735 --> 35:10.739
don't forget
my North Carolina shorts.

35:10.875 --> 35:13.476
Your shorts? From college?
- Ooh-hoo.

35:13.611 --> 35:16.480
I wore them under
my Chicago Bulls uniform
every game.

35:19.374 --> 35:22.013
So why can't Michael
get his own basketball shorts?

35:22.148 --> 35:23.147
Beats me.

35:23.283 --> 35:25.483
I too am the very lost.

35:25.619 --> 35:27.114
I've seen this movie
a hundred times

35:27.249 --> 35:29.153
and I still don't know why
he can't go back home.

35:29.288 --> 35:32.187
Well, we were in the movie
and we don't even know
the reason.

35:32.323 --> 35:35.264
Well, we can go online,
get more information
on the film.

35:42.970 --> 35:46.007
Titans.
Can I have word with you?

35:46.143 --> 35:49.974
Listen up. I think these aliens
have something sinister planned
with this website.

35:50.110 --> 35:52.644
Why else would it
still be around
after all these years?

35:52.779 --> 35:54.883
Because it's super awesome.
That's why.

35:55.018 --> 35:56.848
But look! Jam Central.

35:56.983 --> 35:59.455
They're probably
using this site
to jam our computer,

35:59.591 --> 36:02.189
so we can't call for help
when they try to replace us!

36:02.324 --> 36:04.525
Stop being the paranoid, Robin.

36:04.660 --> 36:06.927
Now let's figure out why MJ
can't go back home.

36:07.063 --> 36:08.794
Hmm. Here we go.

36:08.929 --> 36:10.858
It says here
that Michael had to join
the Looney Tunes

36:10.994 --> 36:12.592
because they wouldn't
let him go.

36:12.727 --> 36:15.197
Oh, now I get it!

36:15.332 --> 36:17.773
In order to prevent themselves
from becoming prisoners,

36:17.908 --> 36:20.308
the Looney Tunes
had to make Michael
their prisoner.

36:20.444 --> 36:22.973
Oh, yeah!
That makes total sense, yo!

36:23.109 --> 36:26.712
And look! It says here that
the Michael Jordan's lawyer

36:26.848 --> 36:29.846
originally came up with
the idea for the Space Jam.

36:29.982 --> 36:33.386
Well, if anyone knows comedy,
it's lawyers.

36:33.522 --> 36:35.748
Okay, Titans.
You got your answer.

36:35.884 --> 36:39.858
Now can we please
get off this website
before something bad happens?

36:39.994 --> 36:42.826
Not yet, bro. I want to play
some of them classic games.

36:47.532 --> 36:48.964
I knew it!

36:49.099 --> 36:50.735
This website
is trying to hack our computer!

36:51.435 --> 36:53.503
Relax, dude.

36:53.638 --> 36:55.572
The computer is probably
just having an issue
with the outdated software.

36:55.707 --> 36:57.837
We can't take that risk!

36:57.972 --> 36:59.541
We need to shut it down now!

37:02.985 --> 37:04.844
Is he the dead?

37:04.980 --> 37:06.683
Mm, no. He's still breathing.

37:06.819 --> 37:08.720
Great!
Let's get back to the movie.

37:10.989 --> 37:12.856
The view back here stinks.

37:13.996 --> 37:15.930
Whoa!

37:16.065 --> 37:17.660
Whoa! Oh, what?
-We're right in front
of Michael's house.

37:17.795 --> 37:20.431
-I knew that!
-

37:20.566 --> 37:22.105
Okay, let's go in this way.

37:22.241 --> 37:24.736
I say let's go in that way!

37:25.902 --> 37:27.970
He just never learns.

37:30.344 --> 37:32.212
Now, let me see.

37:32.347 --> 37:35.780
I must be very, very, close.

37:38.419 --> 37:39.584
-Mother!

37:45.863 --> 37:47.863
Nice digs.

37:50.226 --> 37:53.435
Well, well. I wonder
who that could be.

37:55.800 --> 37:58.908
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

37:59.044 --> 38:01.437
Shh! Everyone's sleepin'!

38:01.573 --> 38:03.406
I knew that.

38:03.541 --> 38:06.578
Come on! Come on!
We gotta find
Michael's basketball stuff.

38:06.714 --> 38:08.608
Now, spread out
and search the place.

38:08.744 --> 38:10.414
Yes, sahib.

38:10.549 --> 38:11.880
Oh, brother!

38:12.015 --> 38:14.252
Here I am,
in the peak of my form,

38:14.387 --> 38:17.124
-playin' second banana
to some sort of a hare-brain.
-Yap, yap, yap.

38:17.260 --> 38:19.728
Hmm. This could be useful.

38:19.863 --> 38:21.831
Ah-ha!

38:21.967 --> 38:24.763
Michael must
really love underwear
to keep it in his trophy room.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.761
Oh! One of his shoes.

38:27.897 --> 38:29.834
Nope. Nope. Nope.

38:32.836 --> 38:34.542
Where is that other shoe?

38:36.344 --> 38:38.845
Where are you?

38:38.981 --> 38:39.976
Eureka!

38:41.447 --> 38:43.111
Come to Papa.

38:45.747 --> 38:48.257
Nothing to see here,
kid. We're just
breaking and entering.

38:48.393 --> 38:49.821
What a fuzz-foot.
You are so clumsy.

38:50.954 --> 38:53.253
-Catch, featherhead.
-Thanks.

38:57.100 --> 38:58.660
Well, time to go.

38:58.795 --> 39:00.502
Did we get everything?

39:01.500 --> 39:02.900
The shorts!

39:03.974 --> 39:05.166
In there?

39:06.175 --> 39:07.806
Okay, I'll check.

39:12.347 --> 39:14.307
I found... the shorts.

39:15.249 --> 39:16.518
Whoa!

39:18.483 --> 39:20.814
The pain!

39:20.950 --> 39:22.621
I'm right behind ya, pal.

39:22.756 --> 39:24.553
Eh, that's none too reassuring.

39:24.689 --> 39:25.686
Nice puppy.

39:25.822 --> 39:27.023
How's about a bone?

39:28.030 --> 39:29.230
No dice.

39:29.366 --> 39:31.230
What about a nice holiday ham?

39:31.366 --> 39:32.900
He ain't buyin' it.

39:33.035 --> 39:34.497
-Can't we
talk this over, Rover?
-Down, Beethoven!

39:34.633 --> 39:37.066
Ooh! The kids are here.

39:39.638 --> 39:41.202
Give it to me, Charles.

39:44.780 --> 39:47.245
-Here you go, Bugs.
-Yeah! Thanks, kid.

39:47.380 --> 39:49.016
Shoo! Shoo!

39:49.151 --> 39:51.052
Bad dog!

39:51.187 --> 39:56.021
That is the last time
I'm ever working with dogs
or children!

39:56.157 --> 39:58.224
Bye-bye!
- Hey,
where're you going?

39:58.359 --> 40:00.126
Well, uh, you see,

40:00.261 --> 40:02.198
the Looney Tunes have
a big basketball game
comin' up,

40:02.333 --> 40:04.295
and, uh, your dad's gonna play.

40:04.430 --> 40:05.530
All right!

40:05.666 --> 40:07.965
Yeah! But don't tell anybody.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.442
Isn't it weird that these kids
have, like, no reaction

40:12.577 --> 40:14.770
to an animated rabbit
and duck in their house?

40:14.906 --> 40:18.181
No, Raven. There's nothing
weird about seein'
a bunch of cartoon characters

40:18.316 --> 40:22.111
stealing your dad's stuff
and then telling you
not to say anything about it!

40:22.246 --> 40:25.047
This is it!
This is it!

40:25.183 --> 40:27.186
I don't know
where you are, Michael...

40:27.321 --> 40:29.720
but wherever you are,
you obviously
enjoy being there!

40:29.856 --> 40:31.591
More than spendin' time
with me!

40:31.727 --> 40:33.426
You better hope
this Jordan character

40:33.562 --> 40:35.330
still knows how to play hoops.

40:35.466 --> 40:37.259
You and me both,
brudduh.

40:37.394 --> 40:40.628
Listen, how's this
for a new team name,

40:40.763 --> 40:42.133
"The Ducks!"

40:42.269 --> 40:43.472
Please!

40:43.608 --> 40:44.901
What kind of
Mickey Mouse organization

40:45.037 --> 40:47.476
would name their team,
"The Ducks?"

40:47.612 --> 40:49.704
So sue me.
It's just a suggestion.

40:54.779 --> 40:56.076
You're doin' it!

40:56.211 --> 40:58.546
You're becoming mighty! Go!

40:58.682 --> 41:00.045
Come on, guys.
No pain, no gain.

41:00.181 --> 41:03.186
Ha! That's two more butts!

41:03.322 --> 41:06.589
I don't hear it! What is it?

41:06.725 --> 41:08.927
Come on!
-Now shake it,
keep on sweating!

41:09.792 --> 41:11.197
Eh, guys?

41:11.332 --> 41:12.500
Yeah?

41:12.636 --> 41:15.329
Look who's
finally ready to play!

41:22.746 --> 41:24.481
Let's see
if I remember how to do this.

41:31.483 --> 41:32.346
Yes!

41:55.914 --> 41:56.942
Michael!

41:59.249 --> 42:01.546
Is it really you?

42:01.681 --> 42:05.386
Thank God, you're all right!
You're all right!

42:05.521 --> 42:08.050
Oh-ho-ho. I was so worried.

42:08.186 --> 42:10.723
Come on, Stan.
Don't hug me, please.

42:10.858 --> 42:12.420
-Sorry.
-What are you doin' here?

42:12.555 --> 42:14.896
I gotta take you back.
You've got baseball practice.

42:15.032 --> 42:17.596
I can't. I'm helpin' my friends
in their basketball game.

42:17.731 --> 42:19.429
Let me get this straight...

42:19.564 --> 42:21.532
First, Michael quits the NBA
to play Minor League baseball.

42:21.667 --> 42:25.202
Now he's quitting baseball
to play cartoon basketball
for free?

42:25.337 --> 42:28.711
Yup! His career is really
going places in this film!

42:28.846 --> 42:30.905
If it doesn't bother you,
it doesn't bother me.

42:31.041 --> 42:33.414
I mean... Let me help!
Let me help! I could help!
I can help! Let me help!

42:33.549 --> 42:35.014
What can you do?

42:35.149 --> 42:37.250
Well, you know, I mean...
I may not be very tall,

42:37.386 --> 42:39.113
but I'm slow.

42:39.248 --> 42:41.755
-And large.
-And a dork.

42:41.890 --> 42:44.293
I'll do anything, Michael!
Anything!

42:44.428 --> 42:46.222
-Anything?
-Anything.

42:48.027 --> 42:51.194
Come here.
Come here for a second.

42:51.329 --> 42:53.399
-Sit right here.
- Okay.

42:53.534 --> 42:55.034
Okay, no problem.

42:55.169 --> 42:58.933
All right! All right.
Let's go, team!

42:59.068 --> 43:01.605
You know,
if somebody gets injured,
we could see a lot of minutes.

43:01.740 --> 43:03.877
I'm a cheerleader.

43:15.753 --> 43:17.287
Holds up.

43:17.423 --> 43:19.754
So the big game takes place
in Looney Tunes land?

43:19.889 --> 43:21.290
Yeah, so?

43:21.426 --> 43:23.358
So, why'd they call this movie
Space Jam?

43:23.493 --> 43:25.364
When the Jam
doesn't take place in space?

43:25.500 --> 43:27.702
Because "Looney Tunes Land
In The Middle
Of The Planet Jam"

43:27.838 --> 43:30.068
doesn't have
a nice ring to it, Raven.

43:37.246 --> 43:38.606
Yes!

43:41.251 --> 43:42.619
Butt shot!

43:57.863 --> 43:59.735
Just get out of my way.

44:07.203 --> 44:09.111
-Ready?
- Yes!

44:09.246 --> 44:10.509
Let's go.

44:20.820 --> 44:22.048
Okey-doke. Ready to go?

44:22.184 --> 44:23.850
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

44:23.985 --> 44:24.918
Riot!

44:26.963 --> 44:30.156
Ladies and gentlemen...

44:30.292 --> 44:32.662
the starting lineup for...

44:32.797 --> 44:35.336
The Tune Squad!

44:37.136 --> 44:39.200
Standing two-foot-four,

44:39.335 --> 44:42.168
The Wonder From Down Under...

44:42.304 --> 44:46.540
The Tasmanian Devil!

44:48.613 --> 44:51.480
- At small forward,

44:51.616 --> 44:55.247
standing a scintillating
three-foot-two...

44:55.383 --> 44:57.490
the "Heartthrob of the Hoops,"

44:57.625 --> 45:00.987
Lola Bunny!

45:04.162 --> 45:06.033
At power forward,

45:06.168 --> 45:09.569
the "Quackster of the Courts,"
Daffy Duck!

45:09.704 --> 45:12.335
Thank you. Thank you!

45:14.637 --> 45:17.909
Very funny.
Let's all laugh at the duck.

45:18.044 --> 45:20.383
And at Point Guard,

45:20.518 --> 45:22.575
standing three-foot-three...

45:22.710 --> 45:24.911
four feet
if you include the ears...

45:25.047 --> 45:30.154
Co-captain of the Tune Squad...
"The Doctor of Delight,"

45:30.290 --> 45:33.690
-Bugs Bunny!
-Thank you! Thank you!

45:36.333 --> 45:38.161
And now...

45:38.297 --> 45:40.768
the player-coach
of the Tune Squad...

45:40.904 --> 45:45.065
at six-foot-six
from North Carolina,

45:45.200 --> 45:47.374
his Royal Airness,

45:47.509 --> 45:51.308
Michael Jordan!

45:54.585 --> 45:57.048
Who? Is he a Looney Tune?

45:57.184 --> 45:59.188
Uh... Well...
Perhaps.

46:02.821 --> 46:04.088
You guys ready?

46:04.224 --> 46:05.587
I'm set
to take it to the rack, Jack.

46:05.722 --> 46:07.788
Those Monstars'll
wish they'd never been born!

46:07.924 --> 46:10.791
-Guys, let's just go out
and have fun.
- Yeah!

46:10.926 --> 46:14.562
The challengers
for the Ultimate Game...

46:14.697 --> 46:17.772
all the way
from Moron Mountain.

46:17.908 --> 46:20.275
Oh, come on!
More introductions?

46:20.410 --> 46:21.800
Relax, girl!

46:21.936 --> 46:25.005
They're getting folks
hyped up for the game!

46:25.140 --> 46:26.974
Yeah!

46:27.109 --> 46:29.951
Go, Monstars!
Go, Monstars!
Go, Monstars! Go, go!

46:38.122 --> 46:40.326
What are you looking at?

46:47.965 --> 46:49.696
Cool shoes.

46:52.639 --> 46:53.670
Uh. Ugh.

46:53.805 --> 46:54.701
Ready?

47:00.944 --> 47:02.850
l got it, l got it, l got it.
l got the ball. l got the ball.

47:02.986 --> 47:04.778
Coming through,
little boys.

47:04.913 --> 47:07.985
Who do they think they are,
the Detroit Pistons?

47:10.119 --> 47:11.157
Yes!

47:11.890 --> 47:13.091
Way to go, boys.

47:13.227 --> 47:15.523
Did you see the moves
on that one?

47:15.659 --> 47:17.031
Come on, come on,
show me somethin'.

47:17.166 --> 47:19.128
What you got?
Come on, show me somethin'.

47:19.264 --> 47:20.133
You ain't got no hands.

47:22.038 --> 47:22.964
Huh?
- Whoops.

47:23.099 --> 47:24.300
The duck!

47:24.436 --> 47:26.000
Yo,
D-up on the duck, man.

47:26.135 --> 47:27.336
Yeah!

47:27.472 --> 47:28.801
- Oh.

47:28.936 --> 47:30.977
-

47:31.113 --> 47:33.113
This game is
out of control, yo.

47:33.248 --> 47:35.648
Call the Commissioner Gordon.
Call him!

47:41.622 --> 47:43.183
Oh, my.

47:43.318 --> 47:45.895
She was wide open.

47:46.030 --> 47:47.391
Come on, baby.
I'm open, I'm open.

47:47.526 --> 47:48.991
Hit me up, hit me up.
School's open, baby.

47:49.126 --> 47:51.197
Yeah, yeah. Yeah!

47:51.897 --> 47:53.402
Ha!

47:55.469 --> 47:56.606
Watch the screen!
Watch the screen! Watch him!

47:56.741 --> 47:58.271
Coming your way,
coming your way.

47:58.406 --> 47:59.540
Hey, man, I'm gonna
make him do something.

47:59.675 --> 48:00.503
Get him!

48:05.114 --> 48:07.511
Wait. The Monstars
are up now by six

48:07.646 --> 48:09.675
and we're in the second period?
How'd that happen?

48:09.810 --> 48:11.510
Because this is
the Ultimate Game.

48:11.646 --> 48:13.720
It transcends space and time.

48:13.856 --> 48:15.518
And apparently logic, too.

48:17.523 --> 48:19.424
Nice shot, Mr. J.

48:19.560 --> 48:21.359
Hey, hey, hey, come on.
Come on. Get back on defense.

48:23.027 --> 48:24.023
Way to go!

48:24.159 --> 48:25.792
MJ! MJ!

48:27.900 --> 48:28.866
Red light.

48:29.001 --> 48:30.133
Feed me! Feed me!

48:30.268 --> 48:32.304
Feed you? Feed me!

48:34.177 --> 48:36.402
- Oops. Uh-oh.

48:36.537 --> 48:37.747
Bad little putty tat!

48:37.882 --> 48:39.047
I'll take that,
thank you.

48:40.081 --> 48:42.008
Here, don't try this at home!

48:46.054 --> 48:47.754
-Wai--
-You goin' somewhere?

48:47.889 --> 48:49.422
May I remind you, sir,

48:49.558 --> 48:52.558
that physical violence is
patently against the rules?

48:52.693 --> 48:54.063
Yeow!

48:54.198 --> 48:58.066
Did you order original recipe
or extra crispy?

49:02.037 --> 49:03.732
-Let's go. Come on.
-Me?

49:03.867 --> 49:05.970
-Oh. boy. I'm ready.
I can do this.
-Mouse?

49:06.105 --> 49:07.870
You picked the mouse?

49:08.006 --> 49:09.571
I love basketball.
I've always loved basketball.

49:09.707 --> 49:11.545
-Do you love basketball?
- Uh-huh.

49:11.680 --> 49:13.081
-You're big. I bet you're good
at basketball.
- Right.

49:13.216 --> 49:14.377
I'm small, but I'll try really,
really hard

49:14.513 --> 49:15.974
-to be good at basketball.
-Okay.

49:16.110 --> 49:17.647
-Really I will.
I always try hard.
-Yeah.

49:17.782 --> 49:18.220
My mom says "Try your best
in everything you do--"

49:22.321 --> 49:25.956
-Try to get by me, doll.
-"Doll?"

49:26.092 --> 49:27.590
-Whoa!

49:29.262 --> 49:30.764
-You go, girl.

49:30.899 --> 49:32.291
Don't ever call me...

49:32.426 --> 49:33.935
"Doll."

49:34.071 --> 49:37.168
She is not
the consumer product!

49:37.303 --> 49:39.005
-Nice shot.
-Thanks, Bugs.

49:39.140 --> 49:42.006
Hmm? Where's your defense, boy?

49:42.141 --> 49:43.470
I got you right here.

49:46.607 --> 49:48.611
Piece of pie? Pork chop?

49:48.746 --> 49:51.350
-Some sorbet, perhaps?
- Yeah!

50:06.361 --> 50:07.368
Half-time.

50:09.837 --> 50:11.868
Holey putty tat.

50:12.003 --> 50:13.667
We're better than them.
- Yeah, man.

50:13.803 --> 50:15.442
We got it goin' on.
One more half

50:15.578 --> 50:17.174
-and we're on our way, man.
- We got 'em, boys.

50:17.310 --> 50:19.871
Moron Mountain, here we come.

50:20.007 --> 50:21.807
We're gonna be slaves.

50:21.943 --> 50:23.214
Come on. guys.
Keep your head up.

50:23.349 --> 50:24.480
Got whole another half to play.

50:38.735 --> 50:40.366
It's the boss.

50:41.631 --> 50:44.000
Hello, Mr. Swackhammer.

50:44.135 --> 50:45.901
All right.

50:46.037 --> 50:48.807
Not bad for the first half,
but we gotta keep this up.

50:48.942 --> 50:50.375
Hey, no problem.

50:50.511 --> 50:51.705
-We stole the--
-We stole the talent, boss

50:51.841 --> 50:53.339
from the best players
in the NBA.

50:53.475 --> 50:54.841
From the NBA?

50:54.977 --> 50:56.282
And it was little,
uh, uh, uh, grand-mama.

50:56.418 --> 50:58.087
-What was it, Larry Johnson?
-Shut up!

51:00.020 --> 51:01.915
I smell something.

51:02.050 --> 51:03.926
It's probably
all that nasty cigar smoke.

51:04.062 --> 51:05.554
We have been playing
really hard.

51:05.690 --> 51:07.624
Yeah.
-Not you, you idiot.

51:10.164 --> 51:11.991
It's coming from over here.

51:12.127 --> 51:13.832
- That locker!

51:13.967 --> 51:15.599
Yeah!

51:17.073 --> 51:18.673
-Look!
-

51:18.809 --> 51:20.606
It's the chubby boy.

51:20.742 --> 51:22.172
Ah.

51:22.307 --> 51:25.240
It smells like a spy.

51:28.284 --> 51:29.911
You guys need
a publicist?

51:30.046 --> 51:32.116
- Look.

51:32.252 --> 51:34.289
-I know we're down.
- Oh, yeah,
let's hear the story.

51:34.424 --> 51:36.550
But I've been in this situation
many times before.

51:36.686 --> 51:38.660
Oh, this is a piece of work.
-We can still win this thing.

51:38.795 --> 51:40.394
-It's not over with.
We gotta come together.
-

51:40.529 --> 51:41.623
Oh, yeah.
-We gotta believe in ourselves.

51:41.758 --> 51:43.198
We can come back
and win this game.

51:43.334 --> 51:44.093
Yeah, right.
That's gonna help us.

51:47.599 --> 51:48.971
Looks like Stan just had

51:49.107 --> 51:50.798
a close encounter
with a bug-zapper.

51:50.934 --> 51:54.968
The Monstars.
The Monstars!

52:00.081 --> 52:01.012
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.
- You all right, Stan?

52:01.148 --> 52:02.642
The Monstars.

52:02.778 --> 52:05.120
The Monstars

52:05.256 --> 52:08.183
stole the talent
from the NBA players.

52:11.920 --> 52:13.755
So that's what happened
to those guys.

52:13.891 --> 52:17.766
I think
we should forfeit.

52:17.902 --> 52:19.065
Yeah.
-Listen.

52:19.201 --> 52:20.831
I didn't get dragged down here

52:20.967 --> 52:22.662
just to get my butt whipped
by a bunch of ugly Monstars.

52:22.797 --> 52:24.138
I ain't goin' out like that.

52:24.273 --> 52:25.733
We're lettin' 'em
push us around.

52:27.210 --> 52:28.271
We gotta fight 'em back.

52:28.407 --> 52:29.671
We gotta take it to them.

52:29.807 --> 52:31.013
We gotta get
right in their faces.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.644
-What do you say?

52:34.852 --> 52:36.042
Are you with me or not?

52:41.986 --> 52:44.154
Eh, finished?
Eh, great speech an' all, doc.

52:44.290 --> 52:45.790
Eh, you had 'em riveted.

52:45.925 --> 52:49.159
-But, er, didn't you
forget somethin'?
-What?

52:49.294 --> 52:50.859
Your secret stuff.

52:58.774 --> 53:00.176
Wow.

53:00.311 --> 53:03.212
Whoa! Nice deltoids.
-Play along.

53:05.482 --> 53:08.215
Eh, stop hogging it, Mike.
We're your teammates.

53:08.351 --> 53:11.152
-Secwet stuff?

53:11.288 --> 53:12.584
Secret Stuff?

53:12.719 --> 53:14.984
You wouldn't hold out
on us, would you?

53:15.119 --> 53:17.149
No, I mean, I didn't think
you guys really needed it.

53:17.284 --> 53:20.359
I mean, you're so tough.
You're competitive.

53:20.495 --> 53:23.626
We're also chicken, son.
We need it bad.

53:23.762 --> 53:24.866
-Hey!
-Can I have a little drink?

53:25.001 --> 53:26.733
I'd like some of that.

53:26.869 --> 53:28.060
-If I could just--
- Yeah. Can I have
a sip, please?

53:28.196 --> 53:29.403
You know,
this goes against

53:29.538 --> 53:31.740
everything they taught me
in health class.

53:31.876 --> 53:32.938
Do you wanna win or not?

53:33.073 --> 53:34.408
Bottoms up.

53:36.409 --> 53:38.173
-Yummy.

53:38.309 --> 53:40.215
All right. How about we go out
and kick some alien butt, huh?

53:40.350 --> 53:42.277
Let's go!
How about it, huh? Ready?

53:42.412 --> 53:43.681
Yeah.

53:45.648 --> 53:46.684
Let's go!

53:50.451 --> 53:52.752
Check out all those classic
Looney Tunes characters.

53:52.888 --> 53:54.489
There's lady head turtle body.

53:54.625 --> 53:56.022
And the chicken feet man.

53:56.157 --> 53:58.824
Whoa, this whole crowd
is freaky, yo.

53:58.960 --> 54:00.334
Looks like them animators just

54:00.470 --> 54:02.797
copy-and-pasted these fools
over and over.

54:02.933 --> 54:05.066
I never
noticed that before.

54:05.201 --> 54:07.538
This weirdo is over here,
here, here, and here.

54:07.674 --> 54:09.734
And these cats,
and this guy, and her?

54:09.870 --> 54:11.103
This is crazy, man!

54:11.238 --> 54:13.942
Okay. Okay. Sorry.
Back to the movie.

54:30.860 --> 54:32.598
Coming through.
-Hey.

54:34.628 --> 54:35.469
Bugs.

54:37.138 --> 54:38.230
Special delivery.

54:39.772 --> 54:41.473
- Great!

54:41.609 --> 54:44.104
-Whoa! Boo.
-

54:50.251 --> 54:52.112
Eh, nice kaboom, Wile E.

54:57.852 --> 54:59.285
Again with the guns?

54:59.420 --> 55:01.726
Don't worry, Mom and Dad.
I'll take care of it.

55:14.570 --> 55:16.103
Let's teach them
a lesson.
- Ah, man.

55:19.642 --> 55:21.246
Hey...

55:21.382 --> 55:23.077
Oh, man, look at that one.

55:25.218 --> 55:26.084
Nice butt!

55:29.556 --> 55:31.184
Dunk.

55:31.319 --> 55:32.684
You ain't
going anywhere, chump.

55:34.732 --> 55:37.058
Er, going up.
- You're mine, boy! Ooh.

55:38.928 --> 55:41.403
-Slammy!
- Yes!

55:42.597 --> 55:43.564
Hello!

55:43.699 --> 55:45.132
Cyborg's fun fact.

55:45.267 --> 55:47.903
Pepe Le Pew was
originally named, "Stinky."

55:48.039 --> 55:51.010
Hey, he shares
the same nickname as Robin.

55:51.145 --> 55:52.106
Two points.

56:00.919 --> 56:02.358
Ooh,
this will be good.

56:04.358 --> 56:06.886
Yo, check out that butt!

56:07.022 --> 56:08.826
-

56:18.340 --> 56:20.200
-Okay, birdie.
-Uh-oh.

56:21.344 --> 56:23.543
-

56:23.679 --> 56:26.646
-

56:38.726 --> 56:40.628
I'm gonna step outside
for a minute

56:40.763 --> 56:43.559
to get some fresh air.
Cyborg, you should join me.

56:43.694 --> 56:44.763
No, thanks. I'm good.

56:46.193 --> 56:47.396
-Ow!
-It wasn't a question.

56:47.531 --> 56:48.602
Okay, okay.

56:51.740 --> 56:53.737
Here's the plan.
I'm going to search their ship

56:53.873 --> 56:55.741
-while you be on the lookout.
-Fine.

57:06.418 --> 57:08.352
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be
on the lookout.

57:08.488 --> 57:11.384
Yeah, and I'm looking out
to see what's inside this
cool spaceship.

57:11.519 --> 57:13.822
Fine. Then help me search
for clues that will expose

57:13.957 --> 57:15.154
what these aliens are planning.

57:15.290 --> 57:16.993
They're not
planning anything, dude.

57:17.128 --> 57:19.063
All that's in here is stuff
from the movie.

57:19.199 --> 57:20.161
Aha!

57:21.938 --> 57:25.600
Perhaps their secret lies in
this bottle of secret stuff!

57:25.736 --> 57:27.202
I wouldn't do that.

57:27.337 --> 57:29.411
That water has been in there
for like 25 years.

57:29.547 --> 57:31.909
There's a secret in here.
You'll see!

57:34.943 --> 57:37.112
Must get to secret.

57:38.949 --> 57:42.347
-

57:42.483 --> 57:45.589
Okay. But I wonder
what's behind this door.

57:45.724 --> 57:47.925
Wait. It says "Do not open."

57:48.060 --> 57:50.928
Because they're
obviously hiding something.

57:52.629 --> 57:53.601
You were right!

57:58.470 --> 58:00.104
I was right.

58:00.240 --> 58:02.169
Will you give it up, dude?
They're not hiding anything.

58:02.305 --> 58:04.270
Then what about this
examination chair?

58:04.406 --> 58:05.776
I'm sure they're planning
to use this

58:05.912 --> 58:07.845
to perform weird experiments
on us,

58:07.981 --> 58:10.076
-like replacing our bodies.
-No, man.

58:10.211 --> 58:12.279
That's just Daffy's chair. See?

58:15.290 --> 58:16.822
Ain't I a stinker?

58:20.461 --> 58:21.561
Oh, good. They're back.

58:21.696 --> 58:23.125
Now we can
watch more of the movie.

58:25.768 --> 58:27.595
All right, guys,
we're right back in this game.

58:27.730 --> 58:29.435
-Come on, now,
let's play some tough defense.
-

58:29.570 --> 58:31.372
Why didn't you get this guy?

58:31.508 --> 58:33.131
He's a baseball player.

58:33.267 --> 58:34.542
Yeah, boss, a baseball player.

58:34.677 --> 58:37.143
Looks like a basketball player
to me.

58:37.279 --> 58:38.712
Yeah, me too.

58:38.847 --> 58:40.942
Shh! He's the one I want
for Moron Mountain.

58:41.078 --> 58:42.210
-Hey.

58:44.782 --> 58:46.511
Are you talkin' to me?

58:46.647 --> 58:48.649
Yeah I'm talkin' to you.
You want a piece of me?

58:48.784 --> 58:50.057
Come and get it.

58:51.522 --> 58:52.528
Uh-oh!

58:53.825 --> 58:56.554
What did you have in mind?

58:56.690 --> 58:58.624
What about we raise the stakes
a little bit?

58:58.760 --> 58:59.964
Mm-hmm.

59:00.862 --> 59:02.365
Interesting.

59:02.500 --> 59:04.069
Gross!

59:04.205 --> 59:06.639
He just blew secondhand smoke
in Michael Jordan's face!

59:06.775 --> 59:10.044
He is the worst of
all the villains.

59:10.179 --> 59:11.469
If we win...

59:11.605 --> 59:13.345
you give the NBA players
their talent back.

59:13.481 --> 59:15.276
But what if we win?

59:16.818 --> 59:18.679
-If you win?
- Uh-huh.

59:18.814 --> 59:20.219
You get me.

59:20.354 --> 59:21.522
Good deal, boss.

59:21.658 --> 59:22.587
I like that!
-Eh, doc...

59:22.723 --> 59:24.054
you think that's a good ide--

59:27.193 --> 59:29.158
You'll be
our star attraction...

59:30.997 --> 59:33.200
You'll sign autographs
all day long.

59:35.071 --> 59:38.002
And play one-on-one
with the paying customers.

59:38.138 --> 59:40.168
How does he expect Michael
to sign autographs

59:40.304 --> 59:41.874
and play basketball
at the same time.

59:42.009 --> 59:44.010
Really? You're still
asking questions, girl?

59:44.145 --> 59:46.312
Don't you know by now
that none of this makes sense?

59:46.448 --> 59:48.243
It's Looney! Looney!

59:50.284 --> 59:51.250
Deal.

59:52.755 --> 59:54.150
All right!
- Yeah!

59:54.286 --> 59:55.888
The boss don't
playin' do he?

59:58.553 --> 1:00:00.623
I don't think you should have
done that, doc.

1:00:00.759 --> 1:00:02.092
I have faith in my team.

1:00:04.860 --> 1:00:07.261
Crush 'em!

1:00:07.397 --> 1:00:09.462
It's feedin' time,
boys!

1:00:13.843 --> 1:00:15.577
Ye-ga, er, ba-bee,
er, ba-bee--

1:00:15.713 --> 1:00:18.670
There's butts number nine
and ten, yo!

1:00:18.805 --> 1:00:21.648
I'll tell you brother,
this match is gettin' ugly!

1:00:21.784 --> 1:00:24.778
Oh, yeah! There's a chop
to the head!

1:00:24.913 --> 1:00:26.111
A body slam!

1:00:26.246 --> 1:00:28.185
Another chop! A kick!

1:00:28.321 --> 1:00:31.088
It's not looking good for
the Tune Squad, brother!

1:00:35.393 --> 1:00:39.801
But Mommy, I don't want to go
to school today.

1:00:39.936 --> 1:00:43.562
I want to stay home
and bake cookies with you.

1:00:45.772 --> 1:00:47.605
This is
gonna be fun!
- I'm open! I'm open!

1:00:47.740 --> 1:00:49.203
Lola! Lola! Heads up!

1:00:49.339 --> 1:00:52.338
Oh!
- Belly flop!

1:00:52.474 --> 1:00:54.643
This butt fills
half the screen, yo!

1:00:55.915 --> 1:00:59.615
Oh, my! Bugs!

1:01:00.854 --> 1:01:02.981
-Bugs!
-Is this your man?

1:01:04.658 --> 1:01:05.956
Are you okay?

1:01:06.092 --> 1:01:10.155
Me? Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

1:01:10.290 --> 1:01:12.662
Oh, Bugs... thank you.

1:01:12.798 --> 1:01:14.968
Oh...it was nothin'!

1:01:15.103 --> 1:01:18.205
That was the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

1:01:26.479 --> 1:01:28.249
I need a break from all of
this intense sports action.

1:01:28.385 --> 1:01:29.683
You ain't kidding, mama.

1:01:29.819 --> 1:01:30.980
All this suspense over
who's gonna win

1:01:31.115 --> 1:01:32.579
has got my tummy tied in knots.

1:01:32.714 --> 1:01:35.454
I know how it ends
and I'm still feeling anxious.

1:01:36.655 --> 1:01:37.988
Dude, bad vibes.

1:01:38.123 --> 1:01:39.821
I know what will
calm those nerves.

1:01:39.956 --> 1:01:41.389
Snack time, baby!

1:01:43.425 --> 1:01:45.294
Help yourself to
whatever you want.

1:01:54.168 --> 1:01:56.068
Now, this is mine!

1:01:56.204 --> 1:01:57.845
Mmm, peanut butter.

1:02:03.519 --> 1:02:05.720
Here we go.

1:02:05.856 --> 1:02:07.883
Can you reach those chips
for me, please?

1:02:08.019 --> 1:02:09.417
Get it yourself.

1:02:09.553 --> 1:02:12.519
But you're so tall
and your hands are so big.

1:02:14.860 --> 1:02:16.827
Really? You mean it?

1:02:16.962 --> 1:02:18.730
You're also a strong leader.

1:02:18.866 --> 1:02:20.428
And we can appreciate someone

1:02:20.564 --> 1:02:23.098
who forces others
to act against their will.

1:02:23.234 --> 1:02:24.900
You would make
a great Nerdluck.

1:02:25.036 --> 1:02:27.305
Wow! You really mean that?

1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:29.267
Yeah, totally.
- Oooh, you'd be great.

1:02:29.403 --> 1:02:30.640
Did you hear that, Titans?

1:02:30.775 --> 1:02:32.077
Whatever.

1:02:33.207 --> 1:02:34.374
You know what?

1:02:34.510 --> 1:02:36.949
Maybe you aliens
aren't so bad after all.

1:02:37.085 --> 1:02:38.950
Told you there was nothing
to worry about.

1:02:39.086 --> 1:02:41.754
Now let's get back
to the movie!

1:02:43.817 --> 1:02:46.860
I could have been
a contender!

1:02:46.995 --> 1:02:49.891
The Monstars!
The Monstars!

1:02:50.027 --> 1:02:51.360
Clear!

1:03:06.914 --> 1:03:11.244
Okay. We need a fifth player.

1:03:11.379 --> 1:03:12.754
Hey, Coach, listen.

1:03:12.889 --> 1:03:14.447
You got anymore of
that secret stuff?

1:03:14.582 --> 1:03:15.988
I think it's startin' to
wear off.

1:03:16.124 --> 1:03:18.719
It didn't wear off.
It was just water.

1:03:18.855 --> 1:03:21.990
You guys had the "special
stuff" inside of you all along.

1:03:22.126 --> 1:03:23.762
Yeah. Yeah. I-I knew that.

1:03:23.898 --> 1:03:25.928
But, listen, you got any more?

1:03:26.063 --> 1:03:27.495
Yah, I'll get
a double one.
- Can I have some too?

1:03:29.804 --> 1:03:31.334
-Stan?
-Yeah! Eh, m-me?

1:03:32.909 --> 1:03:34.366
-You're in at center.
-

1:03:34.502 --> 1:03:36.175
Just guard the big guy, okay?

1:03:36.311 --> 1:03:38.736
Guard him? Guard him?
Guard him? I'll smother him!

1:03:38.872 --> 1:03:40.814
I'll be all over him
like a cheap suit!

1:03:40.949 --> 1:03:43.078
I'll be on him
like stink on rice!

1:03:43.213 --> 1:03:44.512
I tell you, he's goin' down!

1:03:51.552 --> 1:03:52.857
Michael, over here! Over here!

1:03:52.993 --> 1:03:54.826
Over here, I'm open! I'm open!

1:03:54.961 --> 1:03:56.225
Come on! Come on!

1:03:56.361 --> 1:03:58.794
Now, you got it!
Get the fat one.

1:04:02.998 --> 1:04:03.898
Yes!

1:04:06.008 --> 1:04:07.969
Ah-ha! Nice shot!

1:04:08.105 --> 1:04:09.944
Big man pancake.

1:04:12.510 --> 1:04:14.883
Haha! Look they made
a "Flat Stanley."

1:04:19.617 --> 1:04:20.988
Let's get him outta here!

1:04:42.037 --> 1:04:42.905
Eww!

1:04:44.974 --> 1:04:46.343
Oh, my!

1:04:53.281 --> 1:04:54.315
How'd he do that?

1:04:54.450 --> 1:04:56.117
Oh, anybody could do that, doc.

1:04:56.252 --> 1:04:58.524
Even you. Watch this.

1:04:58.659 --> 1:04:59.690
Watch this.

1:04:59.826 --> 1:05:01.254
See? No sweat.

1:05:01.390 --> 1:05:03.294
This is Looney Tune Land.

1:05:06.730 --> 1:05:10.071
Ten seconds to go?
Thanks for tellin' me... doc.

1:05:10.206 --> 1:05:13.203
I hate to be the bearer of
bad news, Your Airness,

1:05:13.339 --> 1:05:15.171
but if you don't find
a fifth player,

1:05:15.307 --> 1:05:17.735
your team will
forfeit the game.

1:05:17.871 --> 1:05:19.205
-Now the rules apply?
-Forfeit?

1:05:19.341 --> 1:05:21.110
Precisely, Sir Altitude.

1:05:21.245 --> 1:05:23.018
No way. We'll find someone.

1:05:23.153 --> 1:05:26.218
Da-Da-Da-Da-
Da-Da-Da-Da!

1:05:28.019 --> 1:05:29.486
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:05:29.621 --> 1:05:31.951
I didn't know Dan Ackroyd
was in this picture!

1:05:32.087 --> 1:05:34.258
Hey!

1:05:34.394 --> 1:05:36.624
Perhaps I could be
of some assistance.

1:05:37.964 --> 1:05:39.893
That's our fifth guy.

1:05:40.029 --> 1:05:42.601
Let's go. Now you get to live
up your dream. Let's go.

1:05:42.736 --> 1:05:44.703
All right.

1:05:44.838 --> 1:05:46.969
-All right. We need to
score two points--
-Here's how I see it.

1:05:47.104 --> 1:05:48.437
-Duck...
-Yes?

1:05:48.572 --> 1:05:50.371
You kick it in to
the girl bunny...

1:05:50.506 --> 1:05:51.704
-Yeah?
-...down in the post.

1:05:51.840 --> 1:05:53.477
You dish it back out
to the guy bunny.

1:05:53.613 --> 1:05:55.416
-Got it!
-You swing it around to Mike
over here.

1:05:55.551 --> 1:05:57.479
-Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill.
-You go to the hole
and dominate!

1:05:57.615 --> 1:05:59.482
-We're on defense.
- Oh, yeah.

1:05:59.617 --> 1:06:02.084
Whoa, ho-ho.
I don't play defense.

1:06:02.219 --> 1:06:04.618
-Typical.
-All right, you're gonna have
to listen to Mike on this.

1:06:04.754 --> 1:06:06.656
-Listen up.
-Somebody steal the ball,

1:06:06.792 --> 1:06:09.958
get it to me, and I'll score
before the time runs out.

1:06:10.093 --> 1:06:12.295
-Don't lose
that confidence! Okay!
-I won't. All right.

1:06:12.430 --> 1:06:13.698
Paws and wings in here!
All right!

1:06:13.833 --> 1:06:15.003
Let's go.

1:06:20.902 --> 1:06:24.745
This is why I was born.
I thrive on pressure.

1:06:24.880 --> 1:06:26.610
Excuse me? Uh, uh, s-sorry!

1:06:26.746 --> 1:06:28.441
Yo, yo, yo. Yo. Easy on the
trousers, Daf. Easy, man. Easy.

1:06:28.576 --> 1:06:30.379
Pardon me. Uhm, Mr. Murray,

1:06:30.515 --> 1:06:32.119
something's really been
buggin' me.

1:06:32.254 --> 1:06:34.990
-Yeah?
-Just how did you get here,
anyway?

1:06:36.155 --> 1:06:37.620
Producer's a friend of mine.

1:06:37.755 --> 1:06:39.322
Just had a teamster come
and drop me off, you know.

1:06:39.458 --> 1:06:43.054
Uh-huh. Well,
that's how it goes.

1:06:43.190 --> 1:06:45.532
Hey, you see this, uh, kind of
chunky fellow over here?

1:06:47.096 --> 1:06:48.102
Uh-huh.

1:06:50.404 --> 1:06:53.105
Yeah. Yeah. Oh.
Oh, that's good! Oh, yes!

1:06:53.241 --> 1:06:54.767
All right, let's do it!
You the duck!

1:06:54.902 --> 1:06:57.838
Now, let's all play fair. Here.

1:06:57.973 --> 1:06:59.942
Yo, spaceman, don't choke now!
Come on, come on.

1:07:00.077 --> 1:07:02.244
Come on. Come on.
Come on!
-It's gut check time!

1:07:02.380 --> 1:07:05.086
-

1:07:05.987 --> 1:07:07.181
This must be mine.

1:07:07.317 --> 1:07:08.716
Whoaho-ho!

1:07:08.851 --> 1:07:10.689
This belongs to me.
I'm goin' this way.

1:07:10.824 --> 1:07:12.192
-I'm goin' left!
I'm goin' left!
-Look left! Look left! Yes!

1:07:12.327 --> 1:07:14.392
Whoa-ho-ho! Don't ever
trust an Earthling!

1:07:15.797 --> 1:07:17.028
What'cha got?

1:07:19.762 --> 1:07:22.231
Get the rabbit!
Get the girl!

1:07:22.366 --> 1:07:24.228
Come on! Come on! I'm open!

1:07:24.364 --> 1:07:25.972
I'm o--!

1:07:26.107 --> 1:07:28.206
-That's mine!
-Not today!

1:07:28.342 --> 1:07:29.744
Hey!
- Come on! Ohh!

1:07:29.879 --> 1:07:31.076
Bring it on, dude.

1:07:31.211 --> 1:07:33.609
Whoopsie daisy! Woo-hoo!

1:07:34.683 --> 1:07:35.677
You're mine!

1:07:40.484 --> 1:07:42.288
Number twelve with the assist!

1:07:44.759 --> 1:07:45.753
Mike, I'm open!

1:07:48.664 --> 1:07:49.691
Never mind.

1:08:27.164 --> 1:08:29.404
The Tunes win!!

1:08:29.539 --> 1:08:32.234
This proves once again that
Michael Jordan is the solution

1:08:32.370 --> 1:08:33.768
to all of life's problems!

1:08:33.903 --> 1:08:36.241
That was a great stretch for
the basket too.

1:08:36.377 --> 1:08:37.506
You know, you really
got some skills.

1:08:37.642 --> 1:08:39.776
You might be able to
play in the NBA.

1:08:39.912 --> 1:08:43.578
Thanks, Mike.
I'll probably quote you
on that.

1:08:43.714 --> 1:08:45.184
But I'm gonna take this
opportunity

1:08:45.319 --> 1:08:46.678
to retire from
the game of basketball.

1:08:46.814 --> 1:08:48.588
-No, come on. man.
-No.

1:08:48.724 --> 1:08:51.082
No, I'm gonna retire right now
and that's all there is to it.

1:08:51.217 --> 1:08:53.619
I'm gonna go out on top,
undefeated and untied.

1:08:53.755 --> 1:08:55.319
That's the way it's gonna be.

1:08:55.455 --> 1:08:56.956
You go on ahead and celebrate
with your teammates and--

1:08:57.092 --> 1:08:59.030
No, come and help us, man.
Celebrate with us.

1:08:59.166 --> 1:09:01.702
No, I-I-I'd like to, but
I have to ice down my knees
right away, okay?

1:09:01.838 --> 1:09:03.304
They're startin' to go.

1:09:03.439 --> 1:09:05.140
-All right. Good-bye, man.
-All right. See you.

1:09:06.941 --> 1:09:08.141
Are you sure?

1:09:08.277 --> 1:09:11.912
Yes. Definitely sure.
Definitely.

1:09:12.048 --> 1:09:15.239
And the best part of the movie
has left the building,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:09:15.374 --> 1:09:18.151
Thank you, Bill Murray.
You're a national treasure.

1:09:18.287 --> 1:09:20.016
-Losers!
- Sorry.

1:09:20.152 --> 1:09:21.152
Choke artists!

1:09:21.287 --> 1:09:22.819
He's the real choke artist!

1:09:22.954 --> 1:09:25.353
Makin' everyone choke on
that nasty smoke like that.

1:09:25.489 --> 1:09:26.788
Mm-hmm. That ain't right.

1:09:26.923 --> 1:09:29.459
The party's over!
Get in the spaceship.

1:09:29.595 --> 1:09:31.127
Why do you take it
from this guy?

1:09:31.263 --> 1:09:33.667
Because he's bigger.

1:09:33.803 --> 1:09:35.131
He's bigger...

1:09:35.267 --> 1:09:37.839
Than we used to be.

1:09:37.974 --> 1:09:39.333
Right!

1:09:39.469 --> 1:09:40.469
What are you doing?

1:09:40.604 --> 1:09:41.569
Ooooooooh!

1:09:41.704 --> 1:09:43.567
-Hey! Wait!
-Come here!

1:09:45.941 --> 1:09:49.745
No! What? Hey! Let me go!

1:10:00.660 --> 1:10:02.223
Had it in ya all the time,
didn't you?

1:10:04.367 --> 1:10:07.158
One thing, though.
Pass me the ball, Bugs.

1:10:07.294 --> 1:10:09.033
You gotta give my friends
their talent back.

1:10:09.168 --> 1:10:10.134
Oops.

1:10:10.269 --> 1:10:12.538
-Do we have to?
-Yeah.

1:10:12.673 --> 1:10:14.500
-Yeah.
-It was part of the deal.
Touch the ball.

1:10:16.175 --> 1:10:18.174
Oh, okay.

1:10:18.310 --> 1:10:20.209
Uh, fair is fair.

1:10:20.345 --> 1:10:21.645
There you go. Touch it.

1:10:28.815 --> 1:10:30.551
That was so much fun.

1:10:30.686 --> 1:10:33.157
I feel so... insignificant.

1:10:33.292 --> 1:10:35.056
My clothes don't fit.

1:10:35.192 --> 1:10:38.429
-What a trip.
-
I'm up for another one.

1:10:38.565 --> 1:10:39.960
Michael!
Do you know what time it is?

1:10:40.096 --> 1:10:41.802
Se-seven fiftee--
seven fifteen,

1:10:41.938 --> 1:10:43.603
quarter past seven.

1:10:43.739 --> 1:10:45.937
Exactly. You've got
a baseball game
in five minutes.

1:10:46.072 --> 1:10:47.902
Okay. Take this.

1:10:49.075 --> 1:10:49.909
Is it safe?

1:10:50.045 --> 1:10:51.411
Yeah. Put in my bag.

1:10:52.848 --> 1:10:54.280
It's kind of...

1:10:54.416 --> 1:10:56.308
I really enjoyed playing
with you guys.

1:10:56.444 --> 1:10:58.987
-You guys got a lot of, uh...
- Uh-huh?

1:10:59.122 --> 1:11:00.783
-A lot of, uh...
- Yes?

1:11:00.918 --> 1:11:03.055
Well, whatever it is,
you got a lot of it.

1:11:06.026 --> 1:11:07.427
Well, gotta go.

1:11:08.361 --> 1:11:10.055
-Bugs?
-Eh, Mike?

1:11:10.191 --> 1:11:12.693
-Stay outta trouble.
-You know I will.

1:11:12.828 --> 1:11:14.461
-Come here!

1:11:14.596 --> 1:11:16.265
-Ohh!
-

1:11:17.735 --> 1:11:19.373
Ah-hoo, hoo, hoo!

1:11:20.572 --> 1:11:22.601
Wow!
What a great movie!

1:11:22.737 --> 1:11:23.969
You were right, Titans.

1:11:24.105 --> 1:11:25.913
They didn't come here
to replace us.

1:11:26.049 --> 1:11:28.379
-Yes, we did.
-What?

1:11:28.514 --> 1:11:30.414
Why do you think
we were so eager

1:11:30.550 --> 1:11:31.913
to watch the movie
with you?

1:11:32.048 --> 1:11:33.880
We thought you guys
just wanted to hang.

1:11:34.015 --> 1:11:36.557
No. What we wanted
was your powers.

1:11:36.692 --> 1:11:40.623
And we can't believe
you just gave 'em to us.

1:11:40.759 --> 1:11:42.462
We heard you Titans
were dummies.

1:11:42.597 --> 1:11:44.699
But we didn't realize
you were that dumb.

1:11:47.062 --> 1:11:49.268
Yeah. Stupid.

1:11:49.403 --> 1:11:50.632
Okay.
You've had your fun.

1:11:50.767 --> 1:11:52.036
Now give us back
our powers.

1:11:52.171 --> 1:11:53.341
You got it!

1:11:56.573 --> 1:11:58.610
We're the Titans now!

1:12:50.527 --> 1:12:51.928
Where are we?

1:12:52.063 --> 1:12:54.600
Is it just me or does
this place look familiar?

1:12:55.466 --> 1:12:56.767
See!

1:12:56.902 --> 1:12:58.571
I knew those aliens
couldn't be trusted!

1:22:55.066 --> 1:22:56.828
Well, that's all, folks!

1:22:56.964 --> 1:22:59.770
Eh, be-eh that's my line.
Eh, be-eh that's--

1:22:59.905 --> 1:23:01.299
Step aside, babe.

1:23:01.435 --> 1:23:03.103
Let a star do this.

1:23:03.238 --> 1:23:04.605
That's all-- Whoa!

1:23:04.740 --> 1:23:06.607
That's all, folks!

1:23:08.441 --> 1:23:09.643
Can I go home now?
