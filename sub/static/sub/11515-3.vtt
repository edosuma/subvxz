- Unusual discharge?
- No.

It looks like Pluto.

Pluto isn't even a planet, you know.

It's a runt, like your eye.

of attaching mechanism.

04:26.559 --> 04:29.354
Is it penetrating the maxillary artery?

04:30.605 --> 04:33.274
Penetrating the artery.
Why would it do that?

I don't know. I mean...
We'd be guessing.

04:36.235 --> 04:39.447

there's some non-organic core.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.709
It's way too over-built for that.

04:51.793 --> 04:53.294

<i>S, I think she could be in trouble.</i>

37:17.820 --> 37:20.823
LESLIE: Just finishing up a few things,
but I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

37:20.907 --> 37:21.949
- Okay.
- Good night.

37:22.033 --> 37:23.659
- Have a good night.
- Bye.

37:35.212 --> 37:36.339
(SIGHS)

37:37.548 --> 37:41.636
I'm just, um, a little unclear
on what the devices are for.

37:41.719 --> 37:43.846
Right, okay.
So I'm gonna get you to open up.

37:46.807 --> 37:47.850
Great.

37:48.643 --> 37:52.063
Okay, now this might pinch
just a little bit. Okay?

37:53.981 --> 37:55.358
(SARAH GROANS SOFTLY)

37:56.275 --> 37:58.152
Okay, good. (INHALES)

37:59.987 --> 38:01.572
- SARAH: Mmm.
- Beth,

38:01.656 --> 38:04.075
if the pain gets to be
too much at any point,

38:04.158 --> 38:06.118
- I just want you to let me know. Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.371
- So open up. Yep. Here we go.
- Mmm-hmm.

38:09.956 --> 38:11.666
- Okay.
- Uh...

38:11.749 --> 38:13.334
- Does that hurt? Okay.
- (GROANS)

38:13.417 --> 38:15.617
- (SHUSHING) No, no, no.
- (SARAH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

38:15.753 --> 38:17.922
No movement. Okay?

38:20.007 --> 38:23.594
- All right. Okay.
- (GROANING)

38:27.515 --> 38:30.518
Okay, so, um,
I've penetrated the device,

38:30.601 --> 38:33.145
which now means that
the slightest movement on your part

38:33.229 --> 38:34.772
will cause it to erupt.

38:34.855 --> 38:36.107
- Do you understand?
- (GRUNTS)

38:36.190 --> 38:40.027
Don't, don't nod.
Uh, just blink once if you understand.

38:42.238 --> 38:44.323
Okay, if you do move,

38:44.407 --> 38:48.244
a burst of tendrils will release
a fatal dose of tetrodotoxin.

38:48.327 --> 38:51.872
So, again, just need you to blink
once so that you understand.

38:51.956 --> 38:53.290
(WHIMPERS)

38:55.292 --> 38:57.461
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Great.

38:57.545 --> 38:58.963
Beth, I am so sorry,

38:59.046 --> 39:02.299
but you really don't know
what you're getting into here.

39:02.383 --> 39:04.135
I had to call my superiors, so...

39:04.969 --> 39:06.637
Well, they'll probably
be here any minute.

39:06.721 --> 39:10.391
But until then, honestly, no movement.

39:10.474 --> 39:12.893
It is... It is super critical.

39:12.977 --> 39:14.395
- (GRUNTS SOFTLY)
- God.

39:14.478 --> 39:16.164
You know, when you first came
sniffing around here,

39:16.188 --> 39:19.233
I had instructions. Misdirect you.

39:19.316 --> 39:20.568
Send you on your way.

39:20.651 --> 39:23.237
But nobody told me
that you'd be coming back

39:23.320 --> 39:26.157
or that you're one
of the test subjects.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.784
God, you don't know how lucky
you are to be chosen for this.

39:28.868 --> 39:30.453

- (SARAH WHIMPERS)

39:30.536 --> 39:33.706
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- Oh, thank God, they're here.

39:33.789 --> 39:35.624
- Don't move.

39:45.301 --> 39:46.635
(GASPING)

39:49.096 --> 39:51.223
- (SARAH GASPING)
- Sarah.

39:52.099 --> 39:54.477
- (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
- What?

39:54.560 --> 39:56.520
(MUFFLED) I can't move.

39:56.604 --> 39:59.249
I can't understand a word you're saying
with that thing in your mouth.

(GASPS)

40:00.608 --> 40:02.610
Very still...

40:02.693 --> 40:04.862
- (GASPS)
- FERDINAND: Oh.

40:04.945 --> 40:06.572
Nothing to worry about.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.783
If she'd punctured it,
you'd already be dead.

40:11.827 --> 40:13.579
What the hell are you doing here?

40:13.662 --> 40:17.875
Sarah, earlier today, I received some
rather interesting news from Rachel.

40:17.958 --> 40:20.377
Susan Duncan is alive.

40:21.504 --> 40:22.546
What?

40:26.175 --> 40:27.593
(DOOR OPENS)

40:28.886 --> 40:30.096
(DOOR CLOSES)

40:43.943 --> 40:46.946
It's my curse, detachment.

40:47.530 --> 40:49.949
I've spent my whole life observing you,

40:50.032 --> 40:54.662
but I don't know how to be with you.

40:55.955 --> 40:58.207
Because you abandoned me.

40:58.707 --> 41:01.377
Father thought Neolution murdered you,

41:01.460 --> 41:03.337
but you are Neolution.

41:03.420 --> 41:04.797
So are you.

41:05.965 --> 41:07.258
I'm sorry, Rachel.

41:07.967 --> 41:10.344
I wanted to be your mother

41:10.427 --> 41:13.597
but it was necessary to cut the cord.

41:14.181 --> 41:16.183
You raised a CASTOR clone instead.

41:16.267 --> 41:18.269
Please be kind to Ira.

41:20.146 --> 41:22.356
CASTOR was never
completely under my control,

41:22.439 --> 41:24.775
to be raised homogeneously like that.

41:25.734 --> 41:27.444
I wanted him to be different.

41:28.362 --> 41:29.613
And me?

41:31.115 --> 41:32.950
Raised by Aldous Leekie.

41:34.243 --> 41:36.453
Sent off to boarding school.

41:38.497 --> 41:39.790
Topside...

41:41.292 --> 41:42.376
Helsinki?

41:44.086 --> 41:46.589
You weren't supposed
to know about Helsinki.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.048
Well, I do.

41:51.093 --> 41:55.306
- And yet, here I am.
- Rachel, you are the experiment.

41:56.140 --> 42:01.270
One day, you may take over.
But be patient. Recover.

42:02.104 --> 42:04.440
Everyone needs a purpose in life.

42:05.941 --> 42:08.986
Ours is all in service

42:10.404 --> 42:12.198
of the greater good.

42:12.281 --> 42:14.074
What is it, Mother?

42:15.284 --> 42:16.911
What is our greater good?

42:19.121 --> 42:21.707
To control human evolution, darling.

42:22.708 --> 42:26.003
To create a more perfect human being.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.158
SARAH: <i>You threw me in
the middle of this shit.</i>

42:38.182 --> 42:39.902
And now you're just
going to blow it all up.

42:40.476 --> 42:41.644
Who's the science now, bitch?

42:42.603 --> 42:45.856
Well I'm in this little room
all by myself and I need to...

42:47.107 --> 42:48.107
(WHISPERS) Masturbate?

42:48.150 --> 42:49.151
Another message...

42:49.568 --> 42:52.363
And is she the youngest
subject to develop symptoms.

42:52.446 --> 42:53.447
She is.

42:54.490 --> 42:57.117
I'll deal with anyone to get
this implant out of my face.

42:57.201 --> 42:58.452
I can't trust you now.

42:59.370 --> 43:01.705
I think we figured out what the bots do.
