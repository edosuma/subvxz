00:00.894 --> 00:02.254
Previously on The O.C.:

00:02.254 --> 00:06.374
If you ever want to kick it or hang out or something, I'm around.

00:06.374 --> 00:08.774
Would you, maybe, want to go to prom with me?

00:08.774 --> 00:09.854
All right.

00:10.294 --> 00:11.494
Oh, my God.

00:12.374 --> 00:15.854
Let's go, come on! Get in. Don't be a little bitch.

00:19.174 --> 00:20.854
Will you stop by the Newport Group?

00:20.854 --> 00:24.094
There's a concept drawing for the hospital that your father needs for his presentation.

00:24.094 --> 00:27.254
There's been a fire at the Newport Group. They think Seth did it.

00:37.734 --> 00:42.054
...31 cents a share. Also, to recap what I had told you earlier coming out...

00:55.494 --> 00:56.694
Hi, man.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.454
So, how'd it go?

00:58.454 --> 01:01.734
He denied everything. Stopped by the office, picked up the drawing and left.

01:01.734 --> 01:04.373
Well, that's a good thing, except you don't believe him.

01:04.373 --> 01:06.134
I didn't know what to say.

01:06.214 --> 01:08.534
It was an accident, I swear.

01:09.614 --> 01:10.974
All right, so tell your dad.

01:10.974 --> 01:12.974
Ordinarily, of course, I'd believe him, you know that,

01:12.974 --> 01:16.214
but in light of these revelations about his recent behavior, I don't know.

01:16.254 --> 01:17.774
I think he's hiding something.

01:17.774 --> 01:21.294
Dad, remember when I called you the worst father ever?

01:21.294 --> 01:24.694
Right after that, I swung by your place of work, I smoked a joint,

01:24.734 --> 01:28.694
I forgot to put it out, and now your office fits into an ashtray.

01:29.974 --> 01:33.654
The security camera in the garage has him as the last person to leave.

01:33.654 --> 01:36.134
But if he's telling the truth and you accuse him of lying...

01:36.134 --> 01:38.094
Well, clearly I've disappointed him enough already.

01:38.094 --> 01:40.294
I don't need to give him any more ammo.

01:40.294 --> 01:44.534
Well, this is shaping up to be a hell of a graduation.

01:44.534 --> 01:46.374
I can't do hard time, Ryan.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.734
Well, lying to Sandy Cohen, what's harder than that?

01:50.054 --> 01:53.494
I'm going to go to the car and get my iPod, listen to sad, depressing music for a change.

01:53.534 --> 01:55.054
- Which car?
- My mom's.

01:55.054 --> 01:56.614
You know what, actually, I'll get it.

01:56.654 --> 01:58.014
It's okay. It's just in the garage.

01:58.014 --> 02:01.934
Uh, no, it's not. I, uh, I parked on the street. I've been meaning to move it. I'll get it.

02:15.734 --> 02:17.614
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

02:17.854 --> 02:18.934
What are you doing here, man?

02:18.934 --> 02:20.614
Look, I just bailed out of the car and ran.

02:20.614 --> 02:21.694
Yeah, what about the cops?

02:21.694 --> 02:22.854
I think they got a good look at me.

02:22.854 --> 02:26.214
I-I can't go home. I've got to get out of town.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.374
Yeah, well, have a nice trip.

02:27.374 --> 02:29.974
I need your help! I need your help, man. Okay?

02:29.974 --> 02:31.134
I'm not gonna help you. I'm done helping you.

02:31.134 --> 02:32.054
I need some money.

02:32.054 --> 02:33.694
I got graduation. My family's coming in tomorrow.

02:33.694 --> 02:35.014
You don't get it, do you?

02:35.054 --> 02:37.494
If I go down, you are going down with me.

02:37.494 --> 02:39.694
You know, and not on some assault charge, man.

02:39.694 --> 02:43.134
- That was a $120,000 car we stole.
- You stole.

02:44.134 --> 02:46.494
Yeah. Tell it to the cops.

02:46.854 --> 02:48.854
Or your mom, when she gets here.

02:49.334 --> 02:51.454
I'm sure she'll be real proud.

03:30.460 --> 03:34.340
I can't believe in a couple of hours we're going to be on that stage in our cap and gowns.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.780
Well, except for Seth, who may be in an orange jumpsuit.

03:36.780 --> 03:37.740
Taylor!

03:37.780 --> 03:41.260
Sorry, Summer. I'm just really nervous about my valedictorian speech.

03:41.260 --> 03:43.180
Well, look, it's not like Cohen got charged with anything.

03:43.220 --> 03:46.740
He didn't burn the entire building down. He just damaged a couple of offices.

03:46.780 --> 03:48.380
You know, it sounds like you're talking about Ryan.

03:48.380 --> 03:52.300
Sounds like the smoldering passion we unleashed in Seth needed an outlet.

03:52.300 --> 03:56.300
Think again, Taylor. I don't think Cohen's the one that needs to get laid.

03:57.260 --> 03:58.660
Au contraire, Summer.

03:58.700 --> 04:03.300
Have I told you about my after, after prom party with Sung Ho and Yung Nam?

04:03.300 --> 04:07.860
It was hot and spicy and let's just say I had my very own Korean barbecue.

04:07.860 --> 04:09.300
Bibimbap.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.300
- Wow.
- I'm so off kimchi.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.420
Marissa.

04:12.460 --> 04:15.380
Hey, Mom. Isn't it a bit early to be saving seats?

04:15.420 --> 04:19.180
I brought you something. It's from Dad. A gift, maybe.

04:19.180 --> 04:21.140
Clearly he wanted you to have it for graduation.

04:21.140 --> 04:23.220
I just thought you might want it right away.

04:23.580 --> 04:26.500
- Yeah. Yeah, thanks.
- Okay.

04:27.140 --> 04:28.420
I'll see you in a bit. Bye, girls.

04:28.420 --> 04:29.460
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.900
That was nice of him to think of you.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.220
Yeah. I'm gonna...

04:42.500 --> 04:44.460
- Dawn.
- Kirsten.

04:48.300 --> 04:51.060
- Come on in.
- Oh, thank you. Thanks.

04:51.060 --> 04:54.780
Wow, seems like forever since I was last here.

04:54.780 --> 04:55.740
Give me your bags.

04:55.780 --> 04:58.140
Of course, maybe I was just too drunk to remember.

04:59.180 --> 05:02.380
- Kidding. I'm doing good.
- It seems that way.

05:02.660 --> 05:04.180
Hey, Mom.

05:04.460 --> 05:06.420
- Graduate.
- How are you doing?

05:06.500 --> 05:08.140
I'm glad you could make it.

05:11.660 --> 05:13.500
Gracias, Mima.

05:15.060 --> 05:16.780
Well, Kaitlin. Hello.

05:16.780 --> 05:19.220
- Dr. Roberts.
- We weren't expecting you.

05:19.220 --> 05:22.700
Well, you know, since my grades went from B's to A's,

05:22.700 --> 05:26.940
I was actually wondering if you could change my A's to B's.

05:27.340 --> 05:30.100
Yes, well, Kaitlin, I think that augmentation is something to be discussed

05:30.140 --> 05:32.900
with your mother-- when you're older.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.140
Dude, I'm totally kidding.

05:35.300 --> 05:39.380
I just love graduations. I thought I might stop by.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.620
- Kaitlin? Sweetie, hi.
- Hi.

05:41.620 --> 05:43.700
- Is everything okay?
- Totally.

05:44.060 --> 05:47.420
I figured it was a safe bet, you know, Dad wouldn't come here.

05:47.420 --> 05:49.500
So I thought maybe you'd have an extra seat.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.220
Yeah, great, okay.

05:51.980 --> 05:55.660
All right, well, I'm just going to go to the hot tub, because I am so stressed out,

05:55.660 --> 05:57.260
finals, you know.

05:58.260 --> 05:59.500
Okay.

06:00.460 --> 06:03.300
That's very nice of her to come home to support her sister.

06:03.300 --> 06:06.460
Yeah. Really nice.

06:13.580 --> 06:15.340
- Father.
- Son.

06:15.340 --> 06:18.900
Uh... I just wanted to make sure you had the camera charged for graduation.

06:18.900 --> 06:22.700
I do. Although, you're going to have to explain to your nana the whole Ofoto concept.

06:22.700 --> 06:23.980
She's not so good with the Internet.

06:23.980 --> 06:28.540
Sure. And when they announce my name, uh, could you...

06:28.540 --> 06:33.220
not do that cheer you did for me when I won Capture The Flag at Parents' Weekend?

06:34.620 --> 06:36.260
Which cheer was that?

06:36.260 --> 06:39.340
Oh. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Check out my boy, Cohen

06:39.340 --> 06:41.420
Can you believe how he's growin'?

06:41.420 --> 06:43.260
The competition away he's blowin'...

06:43.260 --> 06:46.220
That's the one. Please, don't do that. Ever.

06:47.940 --> 06:52.100
Despite everything, we're still very proud of you.

06:53.820 --> 06:57.460
Yeah. Damn it. Why does Sandy Cohen have to be the best father ever?

06:57.460 --> 06:58.540
This is too hard.

06:58.540 --> 07:02.180
Um, Dad, I smoked a joint. I forgot to put it out.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.060
That's what started the fire.

07:08.820 --> 07:11.180
Well, I appreciate you coming clean.

07:11.180 --> 07:14.700
But what I can't forgive is... is all the lying.

07:14.700 --> 07:15.380
Yeah, I know.

07:15.380 --> 07:17.820
You smoked dope, you didn't tell me the truth about Brown,

07:17.820 --> 07:20.580
and that you couldn't come to me.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.340
I was embarrassed.

07:24.860 --> 07:26.820
What? We're your parents.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.660
You know, we specialize in embarrassing you.

07:29.660 --> 07:32.940
Yeah, I know. But I felt like I couldn't really talk to you, though.

07:32.940 --> 07:35.620
I tried to, a couple of times, but you're always so busy with work

07:35.620 --> 07:37.820
and I was afraid of upsetting Mom.

07:40.540 --> 07:42.380
I understand that,

07:43.500 --> 07:45.220
and I'm sorry.

07:47.220 --> 07:48.860
Well, we both screwed up.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.980
We're both usually so awesome.

07:50.980 --> 07:53.300
Well, this is still very serious, isn't it?

07:53.300 --> 07:55.780
A couple hundred of thousands of dollars worth of damage,

07:55.780 --> 07:59.380
and there's a few offices that have to be rebuilt, and I still need to speak to the police.

07:59.380 --> 08:01.580
Yeah, yeah, I figured.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.780
But you know what?

08:03.940 --> 08:07.180
I don't want any of that standing in the way today.

08:07.620 --> 08:12.140
Because your mother and I have been looking forward to this moment for... forever.

08:13.380 --> 08:15.380
No cheer?

08:16.420 --> 08:17.820
No cheer.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.420
How about a hug?

08:20.100 --> 08:21.380
Sure.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.940
Thanks, Dad. I love you, kid.

08:25.940 --> 08:28.420
I can't say "I love you" to another man.

08:29.020 --> 08:31.500
But I have much affection for you, as well.

08:37.740 --> 08:38.900
Hey.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.140
- Hey.
- Everything okay?

08:41.140 --> 08:42.500
Can you sit?

08:43.580 --> 08:45.060
Okay.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.820
Well, how's your dad?

08:49.820 --> 08:51.820
Really good, actually.

08:51.820 --> 08:53.780
He's not getting beat up by anyone right now,

08:53.780 --> 08:56.020
and he's not in charge of anyone's money, so...

08:56.020 --> 08:56.980
That's good.

08:56.980 --> 09:00.580
He's actually sailing really, really nice boats for rich people.

09:00.580 --> 09:03.140
- Sounds like fun.
- I know, that's what I thought.

09:03.140 --> 09:05.820
Oh, you want to, like, rent a yacht? We totally should.

09:05.820 --> 09:08.260
More like work on one.

09:08.260 --> 09:11.780
See, my dad is captain of this yacht that's sailing to the Greek Islands,

09:11.780 --> 09:14.420
and he says they need extra crew members.

09:14.460 --> 09:17.660
So he asked me if I wanted to go.

09:19.060 --> 09:20.620
You don't know how to sail boats.

09:20.620 --> 09:25.020
This would be more like, you know, peeling potatoes, washing dishes.

09:25.020 --> 09:28.140
Oh, yes, much more in your area of expertise.

09:28.140 --> 09:30.340
Yeah, but it's just for a year.

09:30.540 --> 09:33.180
- What about college?
- What about college?

09:33.180 --> 09:36.900
I'm not meant for college. Not now, anyway.

09:38.020 --> 09:41.580
You guys are all leaving, I'm going to be stuck here alone.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.380
I need a new life.

09:46.060 --> 09:47.820
I need a change.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.020
Well, scrubbing decks would definitely be a change.

09:51.340 --> 09:54.260
Then it's kind of the perfect graduation present.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.860
And you know, this way, I can hang out with my dad.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.900
He seems to have turned it around.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.460
When would you leave?

10:04.460 --> 10:07.380
Well... that's the only thing.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.820
The boat is supposed to leave Hawaii middle of the week,

10:09.820 --> 10:12.900
so I'd have to fly out tomorrow night.

10:13.300 --> 10:16.340
My dad also kind of included the plane ticket.

10:24.700 --> 10:28.660
If you promise to sail up to Rhode Island, I'm in.

10:32.620 --> 10:34.940
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

10:50.100 --> 10:53.100
Wherever you're going, hopefully, they have a Laundromat.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.820
What about the cops?

10:54.820 --> 10:57.100
I didn't see them. Maybe you're just being paranoid.

10:57.140 --> 11:00.860
No... I just, I got to get out of here, you know? I'm just waiting for some cash.

11:00.860 --> 11:03.780
You could make that money in no time. If you want to go, go.

11:04.380 --> 11:06.740
Unless it's not money you're waiting for.

11:08.060 --> 11:10.020
Get in; let's go.

11:10.020 --> 11:12.380
You're still thinking about Marissa, aren't you?

11:13.700 --> 11:17.020
I mean, you cheated on her, and now you can't stop thinking about her.

11:17.020 --> 11:19.540
I asked you for clothes, okay? Not opinions.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.980
God, you chicks and your opinions, man.

11:21.980 --> 11:24.500
So this girl's the best thing that's ever happened to you.

11:24.500 --> 11:28.460
You freaked out, ruined it, and now you regret it.

11:28.460 --> 11:29.700
- You know, you can walk.
- And now what?

11:29.700 --> 11:32.420
You think that you're gonna convince her to go to Mexico?

11:37.220 --> 11:40.060
This is it, dude. Never going to have to step foot in this stupid school

11:40.060 --> 11:41.860
or this stupid student lounge again.

11:41.860 --> 11:43.340
Nostalgic already, huh?

11:43.340 --> 11:48.620
Never going to have to see any of these shoe-peeing, shallow, water polo playing...

11:48.620 --> 11:52.260
Get out of my way, geek. What is that, a dress?

11:52.300 --> 11:54.900
It's a graduation gown; you're wearing one, too.

11:54.900 --> 11:56.700
Queer admitted to wearing a gown.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.220
Hey.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.420
You guys look so cute.

12:03.460 --> 12:05.300
Is everything okay at home?

12:05.300 --> 12:07.620
Sandy Cohen and I got a little man-boy love going.

12:07.620 --> 12:08.980
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:09.020 --> 12:12.060
Graduates, let's step outside for the processional.

12:12.060 --> 12:14.220
Ryan, can I talk to you for a sec?

12:14.220 --> 12:15.540
Sure, yeah.

12:19.020 --> 12:20.860
So what do you think?

12:23.020 --> 12:25.540
You think it's the stupidest idea ever, right?

12:25.540 --> 12:27.740
No, I, uh, it sounds great.

12:28.060 --> 12:29.620
It's what you need.

12:31.820 --> 12:33.540
That means a lot to me.

12:33.900 --> 12:36.500
You know, who would have thought you'd be going to college?

12:36.500 --> 12:39.100
And you'd be doing manual labor.

12:39.140 --> 12:41.980
Well, everyone's doing exactly what they need to.

12:41.980 --> 12:43.340
Yeah.

12:44.140 --> 12:48.140
Hey, um, this is going to sound weird, but can I drive you to the airport?

12:48.140 --> 12:49.820
I mean, you were the first person I met here.

12:49.820 --> 12:52.220
I'd kind of like to be the last person to say good-bye.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.860
You know, it's funny. I was going to ask you the same thing.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.100
Hey.

13:01.580 --> 13:02.900
Let's go graduate.

13:02.900 --> 13:04.860
Come on, come on!

13:18.194 --> 13:21.394
They say there's no one older than a high school senior,

13:21.434 --> 13:24.234
but no one younger than a college freshman.

13:24.234 --> 13:28.034
Well, I guess now we'll find out as we begin our journey.

13:28.994 --> 13:30.794
Daniel Aaron.

13:32.874 --> 13:34.674
Ryan Atwood.

13:39.314 --> 13:40.914
But as Cicero said...

13:44.914 --> 13:48.034
"I hope the memory of our friendship will be everlasting."

13:49.674 --> 13:51.634
Seth Cohen.

13:52.234 --> 13:54.754
All right, Sethie!

13:57.834 --> 14:00.274
- Marissa Cooper.
- Yeah!

14:03.674 --> 14:07.154
And just because we're leaving Harbor, does not mean that our learning is done.

14:10.834 --> 14:13.274
"We must learn as long as we may live."

14:13.274 --> 14:15.154
Alex Pittabis.

14:16.714 --> 14:18.714
Summer Roberts.

14:19.594 --> 14:23.034
But if I could leave you all with one final word of advice...

14:26.914 --> 14:29.234
"Don't let the bastards get you down."

14:30.954 --> 14:32.194
Thank you.

14:38.914 --> 14:40.874
Hey, come on back in. Come on, let's get together.

15:02.754 --> 15:07.034
And it has been my pleasure to teach you, to watch you grow,

15:07.034 --> 15:08.914
and now enter the world.

15:10.074 --> 15:11.354
Good luck.

15:12.034 --> 15:18.594
It is my honor to present to you the Harbor School Class of 2006.

15:27.354 --> 15:29.794
There's no such thing as a little racist.

15:35.154 --> 15:38.514
Excuse me, forgive me, but I'm a very proud father, and I,

15:38.514 --> 15:39.914
I want to say a few words.

15:39.914 --> 15:43.474
I think I can speak for Kirsten and the other parents here tonight

15:43.474 --> 15:48.514
when I tell you kids how thrilled we are to share this wonderful touchstone with you.

15:52.954 --> 15:55.154
I know the last few years have been...

15:57.394 --> 16:02.354
There's been tragedy and comedy and first loves

16:02.714 --> 16:07.914
and broken hearts and family members lost and found.

16:07.914 --> 16:11.314
It hasn't all been perfect, but we're all family here.

16:11.314 --> 16:12.834
So, cheers.

16:14.194 --> 16:15.634
Cheers.

16:24.674 --> 16:26.274
Hey, the speech wasn't that moving.

16:26.274 --> 16:29.034
No, it's just so sad, you know.

16:29.034 --> 16:31.754
I mean, it's all over. No more Harbor.

16:31.754 --> 16:35.554
Atwood's going to Berkeley, Marissa's sailing around the world.

16:35.554 --> 16:37.754
- I'm going to Rhode Island.
- Well, I'll be there, too.

16:37.794 --> 16:39.874
We don't know that yet. We haven't heard from RISD.

16:39.874 --> 16:43.314
Whatever happens, you know, we'll make it work.

16:43.354 --> 16:45.634
- We will?
- Yeah, of course.

16:46.314 --> 16:47.634
Sweet.

16:48.514 --> 16:50.434
Are you going to do this all summer?

17:04.074 --> 17:06.594
Hey. Um, can I talk to you?

17:06.634 --> 17:10.273
Yes, of course. Oh! I have to give you your graduation gift.

17:11.354 --> 17:12.954
Honey, what's wrong?

17:14.154 --> 17:16.394
I kind of have some big news.

17:16.554 --> 17:19.194
- Sweetie, I know.
- You know?

17:19.194 --> 17:24.273
Your father called me last week, ran the idea by me, wanted to know what I thought.

17:24.554 --> 17:27.034
And what do you think?

17:27.513 --> 17:30.994
I think that I will miss you terribly

17:31.194 --> 17:36.154
and that if you really want to leave, I need to let you go.

17:36.714 --> 17:38.474
I knew about it, too.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.754
- You did?
- You did?

17:39.754 --> 17:41.714
Mm-hmm. Dad, he called me.

17:41.714 --> 17:43.674
Threw the idea by me, asked my opinion

17:43.674 --> 17:47.194
and also told me that you might need another daughter to worry about.

17:48.474 --> 17:50.874
So that's why I decided to come home...

17:50.994 --> 17:52.594
for good.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.914
Oh, my God.

17:57.594 --> 17:59.514
Cooper family hug, come on.

17:59.514 --> 18:01.154
- Mom. Come on.
- Okay.

18:01.794 --> 18:03.914
Oh, your gift, here.

18:03.994 --> 18:06.714
Don't know how much good it'll be on a boat.

18:09.994 --> 18:11.754
Oh, Mom, it's beautiful.

18:11.754 --> 18:14.474
Maybe you'll get attacked by pirates. You can barter it.

18:15.274 --> 18:16.914
So where are we going, huh?

18:16.914 --> 18:18.674
Just trust me.

18:18.994 --> 18:20.874
I trust you, but...

18:21.834 --> 18:23.234
What?

18:25.674 --> 18:27.154
You got me a car?

18:28.714 --> 18:31.034
You got me a car? You got me a car?!

18:31.074 --> 18:32.394
Do you like it?

18:32.594 --> 18:35.994
I love it... I love it. Are you kidding? How did you...

18:35.994 --> 18:40.034
Oh, I've been saving up for a little while, and Ron, um, my boyfriend,

18:40.034 --> 18:43.194
he knows this guy who restores old cars, and so that helped pay for a lot of the parts.

18:43.194 --> 18:44.274
I got the bow.

18:44.274 --> 18:46.154
Car and bow-- amazing.

18:48.234 --> 18:50.274
I-I don't know what to say.

18:50.274 --> 18:51.474
Come here.

18:53.474 --> 18:55.834
You want to drive me home in your new ride?

18:55.834 --> 18:56.914
Sure. Yeah.

18:56.954 --> 18:59.394
- Okay, I'll get my purse.
- Okay.

19:01.954 --> 19:04.474
And... Here.

19:08.074 --> 19:10.714
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.594
So I just stopped by to say farewell.

19:12.594 --> 19:14.154
You're leaving for the Sorbonne already?

19:14.154 --> 19:18.034
Oh, no, not quite. Sung Ho and I decided to spend the summer in his family's village.

19:18.034 --> 19:20.154
We're defusing land mines in the DMZ.

19:20.194 --> 19:21.914
That's the way to spend your summer vacation.

19:21.914 --> 19:24.394
But what about the after grad party when you already planned it?

19:24.394 --> 19:27.594
As a gift to the Class of 2006.

19:28.234 --> 19:29.994
So my work here is done.

19:29.994 --> 19:33.234
It has been a pleasure being second-circle corps.

19:33.234 --> 19:35.354
I think you can join the inner circle.

19:35.394 --> 19:39.034
I can? Oh, my God. The Fab Five!

19:39.034 --> 19:41.194
I'm so happy and so sad.

19:41.194 --> 19:42.634
I know, me, too!

19:43.994 --> 19:47.754
This is awkward. I was sort of kidding about that inner circle thing.

19:52.394 --> 19:54.794
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

19:54.834 --> 19:56.354
Why are you calling me?

19:56.354 --> 20:00.154
Look, I'm really sorry, okay? And I want to make it up to you.

20:00.154 --> 20:02.194
So I got a plan.

20:02.194 --> 20:05.274
Oh, yeah? Well, I've got a plan, too. It's called never seeing you again.

20:05.274 --> 20:07.594
Look, if I don't get a chance to see you, then

20:07.594 --> 20:10.674
I'm gonna make life real bad for your friend Ryan.

20:10.674 --> 20:12.714
Don't threaten me... or Ryan.

20:12.714 --> 20:14.754
No, no, no, it's not a threat.

20:14.754 --> 20:17.314
Ask him about the car that we stole.

20:26.274 --> 20:27.474
This is cool.

20:27.514 --> 20:29.554
Yeah, yeah, it's a gift from my mom.

20:29.594 --> 20:31.874
Oh, yeah? So it's not the one you stole?

20:34.114 --> 20:35.394
Volchok called me.

20:35.394 --> 20:37.714
- Look, the whole thing is...
- Complicated?

20:38.274 --> 20:39.394
What does he want?

20:39.394 --> 20:40.994
Money to get out of town.

20:40.994 --> 20:42.994
And do you have this money?

20:42.994 --> 20:45.274
Not yet, but...

20:45.714 --> 20:47.754
- Then let me help you.
- No, it's all right, I got it.

20:47.754 --> 20:51.114
Ryan, I brought Volchok on us. It's only fair I help get rid of him.

20:52.034 --> 20:54.914
Come on, we're in this together, okay?

20:58.394 --> 20:59.834
One last time.

21:00.474 --> 21:02.074
One last time.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.388
Thanks so much. I mean it.

21:09.388 --> 21:11.228
- You're welcome.
- For everything.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.468
- Here, here, here, for the cab.
- Oh, God, no.

21:13.468 --> 21:14.868
- Oh, come on.
- No, I got it.

21:14.868 --> 21:15.948
- All right.
- Thank you.

21:15.948 --> 21:17.708
- Thank you.
- Okay.

21:17.748 --> 21:20.228
- Good to see you.
- My turn.

21:20.388 --> 21:21.828
- Okay?
- Okay.

21:21.868 --> 21:23.428
I'm gonna try and say good-bye without losing it.

21:23.428 --> 21:26.508
Why don't we just not say good-bye? How about, see you soon?

21:27.588 --> 21:29.068
- See you soon.
- See you soon?

21:29.108 --> 21:30.668
- See you soon, babe.
- All right.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.668
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

21:33.868 --> 21:35.628
Hey, Seth.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.028
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you, too.

21:38.028 --> 21:40.348
It means a lot that you made it down.

21:41.908 --> 21:43.588
I was being sincere.

21:44.228 --> 21:45.388
Okay, so...

21:45.388 --> 21:47.508
- And thanks again for the car.
- You bet.

21:47.508 --> 21:48.988
Ryan got a car?

21:49.548 --> 21:52.588
Really? I been waiting three years for a car.

21:53.148 --> 21:55.228
I'm supposed to be the spoiled one.

21:55.868 --> 21:58.148
- See you, kid.
- All right. Bye.

22:32.308 --> 22:35.988
Hey, Marissa, easy on the bass. Oh. Kaitlin.

22:36.228 --> 22:37.868
What are you doing? Where's your sister?

22:37.908 --> 22:40.268
Oh, Marissa went to go rendez-vous with Ryan.

22:40.268 --> 22:42.948
And you thought you'd do some renovations for her?

22:42.988 --> 22:45.428
Well, yeah, she said I could have her room.

22:45.428 --> 22:48.268
And there's some paint chips in the kitchen if you want to go look.

22:49.268 --> 22:52.668
Oh, is this going to be a permanent fixture?

22:52.668 --> 22:54.708
Well, I worked really hard on that.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.868
It seems like you and Marissa are on good terms now.

22:56.908 --> 22:58.468
Yeah, figures.

22:58.468 --> 23:00.748
Just as she's about to set sail.

23:00.748 --> 23:02.788
It's pretty cool that you're letting her go.

23:02.788 --> 23:05.148
It's pretty cool that you came back so she can leave.

23:05.148 --> 23:07.388
Well, I don't love Marissa that much.

23:07.388 --> 23:10.908
It's just, all the older kids, they just see me as Marissa's little sister,

23:10.908 --> 23:12.788
and they've graduated.

23:12.788 --> 23:14.788
And now I can rule Harbor.

23:30.788 --> 23:33.388
Hey. Your mom left, huh?

23:33.428 --> 23:35.588
- It went well?
- Yeah, really well.

23:35.588 --> 23:38.348
Well, now we get this out of the way, we'll have nothing left to worry about.

23:38.348 --> 23:40.388
Mm, nah, I won't know what to do with myself.

23:40.428 --> 23:42.748
Oh, I'm sure you'll figure it out.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.068
You sure your mom's not going to be too offended?

23:46.068 --> 23:51.228
Well, I feel bad, but she did say I could use it to barter with pirates.

23:51.228 --> 23:53.548
- This seems to fit the bill.
- Yeah, definitely.

23:53.588 --> 23:55.548
So I'll navigate us to the pawn shop.

23:55.548 --> 23:56.988
No, I'll go. Just give me the directions.

23:56.988 --> 23:59.148
Hey, I thought we decided I was coming along.

23:59.148 --> 24:00.988
I'm going to handle this myself.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.988
Okay, if you come, you're staying in the car.

24:05.988 --> 24:08.308
- Aww, you know what?
- What?

24:08.348 --> 24:11.228
I'm really going to miss you bossing me around.

24:11.388 --> 24:12.748
You'll get used to it.

24:12.748 --> 24:14.708
- Nope, nope.
- Yes, you will.

24:14.708 --> 24:16.908
For the rest of my life, I'm just gonna be sad about it.

24:27.348 --> 24:29.588
- Hey, uh...
- Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

24:29.588 --> 24:32.508
Look, if you came to haggle me on the Ramirez plea, forget about it.

24:32.508 --> 24:34.228
I'm up to my ass in unhappy ADAs.

24:34.228 --> 24:35.708
No, no, I'm just passing through.

24:35.708 --> 24:38.388
What, did you come to admire the wainscoting?

24:39.588 --> 24:41.148
This is my old office.

24:41.148 --> 24:42.668
You're Sandy Cohen?

24:42.708 --> 24:44.188
My reputation proceeds me?

24:44.188 --> 24:46.708
Well, self-righteous, arrogant and a little nutso?

24:46.708 --> 24:48.268
I see that it does.

24:48.268 --> 24:49.828
- Jason Spitz.
- Nice to meet you.

24:49.828 --> 24:51.508
Nice to meet you. You're a legend.

24:51.508 --> 24:54.948
Hey, not to mention, I heard about your post-victory karaoke bar performances.

24:54.948 --> 24:58.548
Defend the poor, sing the classics. I had a reputation and a routine.

24:58.548 --> 25:00.788
Hey, didn't you go to some high-powered, private firm?

25:00.788 --> 25:04.708
Oh, for a minute, then I went into the private sector, into big business.

25:04.708 --> 25:06.108
Why'd you want to leave this dump?

25:06.108 --> 25:11.188
Long hours, no pay... Not to mention the worst coffee in Southern California.

25:11.188 --> 25:15.748
Believe it or not, working here were the best days of my life.

25:16.268 --> 25:18.148
Yeah, right.

25:19.028 --> 25:21.388
Grass is always greener, coffee's always fresher.

25:21.388 --> 25:23.228
- Sandy Cohen.
- Greg.

25:23.228 --> 25:24.548
Back at the PD's office, huh?

25:24.548 --> 25:26.268
Thanks for meeting me here on neutral ground.

25:26.268 --> 25:27.828
- You ready to talk?
- Yeah.

25:27.828 --> 25:29.228
Spitz.

25:29.908 --> 25:31.188
Nice meeting you.

25:31.188 --> 25:32.948
Hey, what are they asking for?

25:32.948 --> 25:36.028
Come on, with a B&E with no priors? You've got to be kidding me.

25:39.348 --> 25:40.588
Come in.

25:43.468 --> 25:45.388
Hey. What are you doing?

25:45.388 --> 25:49.068
In my third month on this book. I'm hoping to have it finished by fall.

25:49.068 --> 25:50.948
It's hard to believe you're done with school.

25:50.948 --> 25:52.308
You're not a kid anymore.

25:52.308 --> 25:54.988
Well, let's be honest, I was never very kid-like.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.788
You always were an old soul.

25:56.788 --> 26:00.148
- Mom, I want you to know...
- You don't have to apologize.

26:00.668 --> 26:03.788
I think that fire was the best thing that could have happened.

26:03.828 --> 26:06.268
Well, then, I did it on purpose.

26:07.308 --> 26:09.388
Your father's talking to the lawyers,

26:09.388 --> 26:11.548
and hopefully, you'll be free and clear.

26:11.548 --> 26:13.908
Okay, good. I just have to wait and hear from RISD.

26:13.908 --> 26:18.028
Speaking of which, I think there's some mail that you might be interested in.

26:35.468 --> 26:37.748
Again, I think the pearls would have looked good on you.

26:37.748 --> 26:39.428
Yeah, you're a funny kid. You got the money?

26:39.428 --> 26:40.628
Yep.

26:41.068 --> 26:42.668
Maybe you can use it to start over.

26:42.668 --> 26:45.708
Thanks, Ranger Rick, but save your speeches for the Boy Scouts.

26:45.708 --> 26:47.948
"Ranger Rick." Ow, that hurts. Whatever, man. We're done.

26:47.948 --> 26:49.948
We're not done yet, man. I just want to talk to her.

26:49.948 --> 26:51.468
Send her a postcard.

26:53.748 --> 26:55.948
- Marissa? Come on...
- Drive, drive. Let's go. Lets' go!

26:55.948 --> 26:58.188
I just want to talk to you, okay? Wait. Wait!

26:58.188 --> 27:01.148
I just want to talk to you. Don't... Wait!

27:20.557 --> 27:22.197
Hey, honey.

27:23.077 --> 27:25.357
So I guess this is it, huh?

27:26.397 --> 27:27.557
Yeah.

27:29.277 --> 27:30.597
I guess so.

27:35.837 --> 27:40.317
Marissa, I just want you to know that everything I ever did--

27:40.317 --> 27:42.437
good, bad or otherwise--

27:43.157 --> 27:44.997
I did it for you.

27:46.477 --> 27:48.717
So that you could have a better life than I had.

27:48.717 --> 27:50.597
And I know I wasn't perfect.

27:50.597 --> 27:53.357
I mean, the thing with Luke,

27:53.357 --> 27:56.757
and trying to frame Ryan for attempted homicide...

27:56.757 --> 27:57.997
Mom.

27:58.877 --> 28:01.837
I love you. Okay, just know that.

28:01.877 --> 28:05.637
Oh, sweetheart, that's all I wanted. I love you, too.

28:07.557 --> 28:11.677
Besides, you know the strength it takes to start over?

28:11.717 --> 28:13.557
To go out on my own?

28:13.637 --> 28:16.717
That has to come from being Julie Cooper's daughter.

28:17.557 --> 28:19.517
I am spirited, aren't I?

28:19.517 --> 28:20.757
Yeah.

28:21.637 --> 28:22.797
Hey.

28:23.357 --> 28:25.037
Ryan and Seth are here.

28:25.037 --> 28:28.517
All right, um... I guess I better go.

28:29.237 --> 28:32.677
You've got to promise to keep things interesting for Mom next year, okay?

28:32.677 --> 28:35.397
- Oh, that won't be a problem.
- Wait.

28:36.277 --> 28:38.717
One more Cooper family hug.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.237
Coop, do you know where this party is?

28:49.237 --> 28:52.717
I think it's in the flower streets, but it could be in the number streets.

28:52.717 --> 28:53.837
I'll check the e-vite.

28:53.837 --> 28:56.757
May I ask a question? Why are we going to another lame Harbor party?

28:56.797 --> 28:58.757
Yeah, it is Marissa's last night in town.

28:58.757 --> 29:01.477
Yeah. We always wind up just talking to each other.

29:01.477 --> 29:04.957
All right, so, uh, Bait Shop, uh, diner...

29:05.637 --> 29:07.917
Wait, I know somewhere where we could go.

29:08.597 --> 29:10.837
But you'll have to follow in your car.

29:19.077 --> 29:21.797
It's a little something, just because I love you.

29:21.797 --> 29:24.797
Uh-oh. Flowers usually means bad news.

29:24.797 --> 29:26.477
Oh, ye of little faith.

29:26.477 --> 29:29.757
No, I spoke to the DA, came clean about the accident,

29:29.877 --> 29:33.597
and since we're not gonna press charges, the whole thing will blow over.

29:33.597 --> 29:36.557
And then it's back to the Newport Group, business as usual?

29:36.557 --> 29:39.117
Well... how about not?

29:39.837 --> 29:43.517
I went back to my old office, the place looked worse than ever.

29:43.517 --> 29:46.757
The guy in there was beaten down, exhausted...

29:47.077 --> 29:48.997
Oh, it was a thing of beauty.

29:50.757 --> 29:52.597
You want to go back.

29:55.157 --> 29:56.717
Where are the kids?

29:57.437 --> 30:00.837
At some party. And then Ryan's taking Marissa to the airport.

30:00.837 --> 30:04.757
Oh. So this is what it'll be like all next year, huh?

30:06.557 --> 30:08.237
Empty nest.

30:11.757 --> 30:14.237
What does one do in an empty nest?

30:15.037 --> 30:17.797
Oh, I have a few ideas.

30:41.877 --> 30:44.717
Okay, this, uh, this looks familiar.

30:44.717 --> 30:49.077
Yeah? Well, it shouldn't. They rebuilt it completely after you burnt it down.

30:49.957 --> 30:53.397
- Model home.
- Yep. It's for sale.

30:53.397 --> 30:55.637
And it's completely deserted.

31:12.637 --> 31:15.277
You guys ever wonder what life would be like if Atwood never came here?

31:15.277 --> 31:16.877
I definitely never would have talked to Seth.

31:16.877 --> 31:18.557
Oh, hell, no. Me, either.

31:19.157 --> 31:20.797
See? You owe me one, buddy.

31:20.797 --> 31:23.997
Me? She'd still be dating a dude who shaves his chest.

31:44.517 --> 31:48.237
I can't believe that for a minute I was actually interested in Atwood.

31:50.477 --> 31:52.877
- No offense.
- None taken, biatch.

31:52.877 --> 31:55.077
It was only until you found out he was from Chino.

31:55.077 --> 31:55.637
Exactly.

31:55.637 --> 31:58.717
You actually invited me to Holly's Beach House.

31:59.557 --> 32:02.557
- Oh, my God.
- You said she invited me.

32:04.717 --> 32:07.957
I'm not faring well on this trip down memory lane.

32:08.037 --> 32:11.557
Well, as fun as it usually is making fun of Seth,

32:11.597 --> 32:13.837
I think it's time I should go.

32:14.397 --> 32:17.117
Aw, here come the waterworks.

32:17.757 --> 32:20.117
I can't believe that I'm saying bye to you.

32:20.117 --> 32:21.477
I know.

32:22.237 --> 32:25.037
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

32:25.037 --> 32:27.277
You're my best friend forever, okay?

32:27.277 --> 32:30.037
And if you wind up hooking up with some hot Greek shipping heir,

32:30.037 --> 32:32.557
- I'm so your maid of honor.
- I know.

32:36.237 --> 32:38.317
- See ya.
- All right, see you later.

32:38.317 --> 32:39.997
You guys, hug.

32:40.557 --> 32:41.757
All right.

32:44.277 --> 32:45.677
Bye.

32:46.517 --> 32:48.357
I've got to get changed.

32:50.877 --> 32:53.317
All right, see you in a while.

32:54.357 --> 32:55.597
Okay.

33:13.557 --> 33:14.837
You okay?

33:15.677 --> 33:16.997
Yeah.

33:22.517 --> 33:24.797
It's so weird talking about that night.

33:25.677 --> 33:28.917
Last time we were here, I was leaving, and now you are.

33:32.637 --> 33:34.197
That night...

33:34.957 --> 33:37.597
did you ever think we'd end up together?

33:38.357 --> 33:40.077
You saying it's over?

33:41.997 --> 33:44.717
You never know. Right?

33:52.477 --> 33:57.077
I'm sorry... for all the craziness.

33:57.117 --> 33:59.357
I wouldn't have done it any differently.

34:01.637 --> 34:03.437
Except maybe Oliver.

34:05.397 --> 34:06.677
Me, too.

34:23.717 --> 34:27.036
Okay, we had fun times stalking rich kids.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.917
Maybe I should drive?

34:32.797 --> 34:34.117
No.

34:40.797 --> 34:43.877
- Whoa, what is this?
- Your graduation present.

34:43.877 --> 34:46.157
Oh, my God, it's a 60-inch high-def flat screen.

34:46.157 --> 34:47.956
Uh, maybe...

34:50.077 --> 34:52.317
- It's empty.
- No, it's not.

34:56.717 --> 34:57.797
Ow.

34:59.877 --> 35:01.677
What is this?

35:01.677 --> 35:06.277
"Dear Mr. Cohen, while your application arrived too late for our fall semester,

35:06.277 --> 35:10.357
we are happy to announce that your application has been approved."

35:10.357 --> 35:12.317
- You got in!
- Yeah.

35:12.317 --> 35:14.197
I start in January.

35:14.837 --> 35:18.397
Let me just say again how sorry I am for messing up the college thing

35:18.397 --> 35:20.957
and lying to you and hurting you and you know...

35:20.957 --> 35:25.077
Hey. Look, it's okay, 'cause everything happened the way it was supposed to.

35:25.237 --> 35:27.517
Well, then I did it on purpose.

35:27.517 --> 35:30.837
Okay. So I'll go to Rhode Island, and I'll get the lay of the land.

35:30.837 --> 35:33.477
Yeah, then we'll have Thanksgiving, Christmas, then we'll be together.

35:33.477 --> 35:34.957
I think I'm going to cry again.

35:34.957 --> 35:36.797
Uh, tears of joy?

35:40.677 --> 35:42.917
Come on, thanks for letting me in your box.

35:45.797 --> 35:47.517
What are we doing?

35:51.877 --> 35:54.037
Are you, uh, you okay?

35:54.997 --> 35:56.837
You ready for this?

35:59.117 --> 36:00.517
I have no idea.

36:00.877 --> 36:04.557
What about you? I mean, you're the one who's leaving the Cohens, doing the college thing.

36:04.557 --> 36:06.317
- I'm terrified.
- Me, too.

36:07.117 --> 36:11.357
So if you ever want to talk or email, if they have that...

36:11.357 --> 36:12.597
I don't how boats work, you know...

36:12.597 --> 36:14.557
I'll find a way to stay in touch.

36:18.477 --> 36:19.437
What's that?

36:19.477 --> 36:23.237
It's this guy; he's been following me. Go ahead, go ahead, pass!

36:23.757 --> 36:25.477
What is he doing?

36:27.157 --> 36:29.517
- What the hell?
- All right, hold on.

36:32.357 --> 36:33.517
Whoa!

36:34.277 --> 36:36.077
Oh, my God, it's him.

36:37.077 --> 36:39.037
What are you doing?!

36:42.077 --> 36:43.557
Oh, my God! Okay, pull over!

36:43.557 --> 36:44.917
Where?!

36:45.117 --> 36:47.877
Stop! What the hell are you doing?!

36:48.917 --> 36:52.837
I'm gonna get him to pull the car over, so we can finally finish this!

36:53.117 --> 36:55.477
- Get away, okay! You're gonna make us crash!
- Pull over!

36:55.477 --> 36:56.997
Stop it!

37:00.317 --> 37:02.477
Ryan, look out!

37:40.157 --> 37:41.237
Marissa.

38:20.557 --> 38:21.637
Marissa.

39:13.117 --> 39:14.357
Marissa.

39:17.077 --> 39:20.477
Marissa. Marissa. Marissa.

39:24.837 --> 39:26.197
Ryan.

39:28.037 --> 39:31.397
Okay. Okay. Okay, I'm going to get help, okay?

39:32.197 --> 39:33.477
No, don't leave.

39:33.477 --> 39:35.357
Yeah, yeah. I've got to get help.

39:35.357 --> 39:38.077
No. Stay.

39:42.517 --> 39:44.157
D-Don't leave.

39:47.797 --> 39:49.317
Okay.

39:50.197 --> 39:54.677
Hold on. Hold on, okay? Okay?

39:54.717 --> 39:56.557
Hold on. Hold on.

39:57.317 --> 39:59.157
It's going to be okay.

39:59.837 --> 40:03.197
It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.

40:03.317 --> 40:04.717
It's going to be okay.

40:10.517 --> 40:12.797
It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay...

40:32.877 --> 40:34.597
Marissa.

40:41.157 --> 40:42.477
Marissa.

40:45.677 --> 40:46.957
