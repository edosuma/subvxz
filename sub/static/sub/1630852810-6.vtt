00:06.006 --> 00:08.925
[opening theme music playing]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.428
[man] Hey!

00:24.274 --> 00:26.109
What did you just do, Bean?

00:26.192 --> 00:29.612
Ugh! Everything is either trying
to kill me or kiss me.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.990
Oh, okay. Let's stop bragging. [yelps]

00:32.073 --> 00:35.910
-We gotta get out of here fast.
-Laughing Horse! Where are you?

00:35.994 --> 00:37.162
[Laughing Horse laughs]

00:39.164 --> 00:40.790
Ugh. He's too far away.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.501
Good, I'm not really
in the mood for Laughing Horse.

00:45.503 --> 00:46.504
[squawks]

00:49.299 --> 00:52.385
-[gasps] Mora! Wait, Bean!
-Who's Mora?

00:52.469 --> 00:55.388
She's this beautiful mermaid,
but she's kinda sassy for a fish

00:55.472 --> 00:58.475
and she has a super annoying voice.
Wait, so do I. Oh, my God.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.643
We gotta go back
and get her out of her tank.

01:00.727 --> 01:01.561
[groans]

01:06.399 --> 01:07.400
[Bean panting]

01:08.735 --> 01:11.112
-Hey, Mora!
-[Mora] Oh, Elfo!

01:11.196 --> 01:12.864
Good thing you brought a stronger friend.

01:12.947 --> 01:13.948
What did I tell you?

01:14.491 --> 01:15.492
[grunts]

01:15.575 --> 01:19.746
I'm here to free you, but if I smash
your face in, I'm not apologizing.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.081
[Elfo exclaims]

01:21.164 --> 01:22.832
[sighs] Give me that!

01:23.958 --> 01:25.919
-[Mora gasps]
-[Bean grunting]

01:27.504 --> 01:28.505
[Bean exclaims]

01:32.592 --> 01:34.219
Bean, meet Mora. Mora, Bean.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.846
Impressive. For a human.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.224
[scoffs] You should see her
in a drunken bar fight.

01:39.307 --> 01:42.602
From what I've heard,
I'm both obnoxious and amazing.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.145
[water splashing]

01:44.229 --> 01:47.148
-Okay. You can leave now.
-Thanks, guys.

01:47.232 --> 01:50.151
Are you sure you can climb down
the ladder with your fins and such?

01:50.235 --> 01:51.236
-[slaps]
-Ow!

01:51.319 --> 01:52.487
Bye, Mora.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.122
[Elfo] Oh, no, Bean,
they're getting ideas!

02:02.205 --> 02:03.706
Oh, no! Run!

02:06.417 --> 02:07.377
Quick, in there!

02:07.460 --> 02:10.004
No, too scary. This way.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.719
[sighs] Okay,
they'll never find us in here. Ow!

02:16.803 --> 02:17.804
Elfo, where are you?

02:17.887 --> 02:20.140
I'm right in front of you, stupid! Ow!

02:20.223 --> 02:22.100
-[chuckling]
-Ow!

02:23.852 --> 02:24.686
Ow!

02:26.354 --> 02:29.107
All right, smart guy,
I'm standing right here.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.150
You come to me.

02:30.692 --> 02:31.693
-Ow!
-[chuckles]

02:31.776 --> 02:33.111
Just, you come here.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.405
All right, but don't try
any of that funny-- Ow!

02:35.488 --> 02:37.365
I'm not… I'm standing still.

02:37.448 --> 02:39.993
No, you're doing something to make-- Ow!

02:40.076 --> 02:41.286
Okay, it's this one.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.621
-[Elfo yelps]
-[Bean laughs]

02:43.705 --> 02:45.206
-[Bean yelps]
-[Elfo laughs]

02:46.166 --> 02:47.208
It's right here.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.085
Ow! Damn it!

02:49.169 --> 02:50.003
[laughs]

02:50.587 --> 02:52.130
[screams] Oh, no! Run!

02:52.672 --> 02:54.924
-Ow!
-[laughs and gasps]

03:18.406 --> 03:19.699
[softly] Elfo, over here.

03:19.782 --> 03:21.159
No, not here, there.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.702
No, your other there.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.287
Here. Come on!

03:25.038 --> 03:26.706
Okay, now lure it over.

03:26.789 --> 03:27.624
Oh, no!

03:27.707 --> 03:29.792
No, that's not it. All right, take two.

03:30.710 --> 03:34.422
Oh, no.
I am trapped in here with no way out.

03:34.505 --> 03:36.382
-[softly] How was that, Bean?
-B+.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.426
[yelping]

03:39.135 --> 03:40.470
[robot powers down]

03:40.553 --> 03:41.387
Yes!

03:41.471 --> 03:42.680
Stience defeated!

03:42.764 --> 03:44.557
Chalk one up for ignorance!

03:45.350 --> 03:46.643
[tense music playing]

03:58.029 --> 04:01.115
-Elfo, there's nothing there!
-I have to see for myself.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.158
You were right.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.455
[Elfo grunts]

04:14.671 --> 04:15.546
Okay, I got this.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.049
How different can a ship-ship
be from an airship-ship?

04:18.132 --> 04:19.509
[horn blares]

04:20.218 --> 04:21.469
[radio plays in Spanish]

04:25.598 --> 04:27.517
[various alarms and horns go off]

04:29.978 --> 04:31.354
[in English] That can't be good.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.690
What about that button over there?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.650
Let me move these levers out of the way.

04:35.733 --> 04:36.651
-Ooh!
-Whoa!

04:41.572 --> 04:42.907
[radio channels scanning]

[waltz music playing]

04:48.621 --> 04:49.622
[horn blares]

04:50.331 --> 04:52.417
Bean, don't toot.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.876
[Alva] Yes, Bean. Don't toot.

04:53.960 --> 04:54.794
Alva!

04:54.877 --> 04:57.171
Bean, I'm speaking to you now
through Boat-a-Vision,

04:57.255 --> 04:59.632
my latest invention,
to beg you not to leave.

04:59.716 --> 05:03.011
I can't hear you.
I have a hammer in my hand. [grunts]

05:03.928 --> 05:05.054
[Alva] I'm sorry you feel that way.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.516
I'm also sorry you broke the screen.
That was an expensive prototype.

05:08.599 --> 05:11.352
-But please listen. If we work together…
-[Bean grunts]

05:11.436 --> 05:13.938
-[Alva] …both our kingdoms will prosper…
-[sighs]

05:14.022 --> 05:17.275
[Alva] I've got a lot of speakers,
but there's only one of you, Bean.

05:17.358 --> 05:20.028
And together, we can reinvent the world!

05:20.111 --> 05:22.572
-[grunts]
-[Alva] You can't outrun the future, Bean.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.701
[gasps]

05:28.369 --> 05:29.579
[Bean] Elfo, the lamps!

05:34.375 --> 05:36.002
What?

05:39.672 --> 05:40.715
Mora!

05:41.591 --> 05:42.800
[grunting]

05:48.890 --> 05:49.891
[Mora gasps]

05:50.516 --> 05:52.060
[sighs] Thanks, dude.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.187
[coughs] Man, that water is nasty.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.481
There's a lot of
amusement park vomit in there.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.608
We're headed back to Dreamland.
You want a ride?

05:58.691 --> 06:00.068
I'm good. [panting]

06:00.151 --> 06:03.905
I can swim home… once I… catch my breath.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.240
Give me a week or two.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.536
Oh, Edith.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.498
At least I have this one card
to remember you by.

06:13.581 --> 06:15.124
"Dream." [scoffs]

06:15.208 --> 06:17.335
But now all my dreams are dead.

06:18.127 --> 06:19.212
[window squeaks]

06:27.804 --> 06:29.680
Oh, Elfo, are you seasick?

06:29.764 --> 06:31.641
Worse, I'm lovesick.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.810
-You'd never understand.
-Try me.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.687
It's about loneliness and uncertainty

06:36.771 --> 06:40.817
and beauty and love and risk and passion.

06:41.484 --> 06:45.029
And then, it all ends
in rejection and agony

06:45.113 --> 06:47.740
and tragedy and heartbreak.

06:48.407 --> 06:49.992
Every goddamn time!

06:50.076 --> 06:52.829
Wow. I've never been
heartbroken like that.

06:53.412 --> 06:56.124
Here, drink this coffee.
It's been boiling for hours.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.335
What the… [grunts]

06:59.418 --> 07:00.795
[sighs]

07:00.878 --> 07:01.796
I'll be fine.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.298
I'm an elf, I bounce.

07:04.382 --> 07:08.177
-[chuckles] Boing, boing.
-[door shuts]

07:09.637 --> 07:10.805
[sobbing]

07:17.603 --> 07:18.855
Boing.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.201
Elfo's in some kind of mood.

07:33.786 --> 07:34.620
Ugh!

07:35.288 --> 07:37.957
You know, I have seen
a lot of freak show romances,

07:38.040 --> 07:39.375
and they never end well.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.960
Some crazy threesomes, though.

07:41.043 --> 07:44.046
I guess Elfo's always gonna be
my little man of mystery.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.299
[Elfo sobbing] Boing.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.595
I've got so much love
and nobody to give it to.

07:53.764 --> 07:54.765
Ow!

07:55.308 --> 07:59.145
Oh. Did you just smack me on the bum-bum?

07:59.228 --> 08:00.354
[creaks]

08:01.314 --> 08:03.649
[Elfo] I hope that doesn't happen again.

08:04.233 --> 08:08.529
I said, I hope it doesn't happen again.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.364
[grunts]

08:11.157 --> 08:11.991
Harder.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.577
-[thuds]
-[Elfo] Ow! That was too hard.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.996
So how'd you end up in a fish tank?

08:17.079 --> 08:18.164
You know the story.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.791
Young, wide-eyed mermaid
sets out from home,

08:20.875 --> 08:23.419
leaves everything with the dream
of seeing her name in lights.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.629
Where did I go?

08:24.712 --> 08:27.173
Yeah, the one place
that has lights. Steamland.

08:27.757 --> 08:31.511
Anyway, apparently,
I'm not film-friendly or… friendly.

08:31.594 --> 08:35.264
So I ended up doing cartoon voice work,
and I'm happy for the gig and all,

08:35.348 --> 08:37.350
but it's not the most fulfilling.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.810
[in cutesy voice]
"Hi, Bean! I'm Squalid Squirrel!" [laughs]

08:39.894 --> 08:42.188
Ugh. Don't ever do that again.

08:42.271 --> 08:44.982
I feel so stupid.
I was swimming around, being like,

08:45.066 --> 08:48.319
"I'm gonna be so famous and super rich.
I'm gonna have a yacht!"

08:48.402 --> 08:50.238
[sighs] I shouldn't have told
the other mermaids that.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.781
They'll never let me live that down.

08:51.864 --> 08:52.990
I know what you mean.

08:53.074 --> 08:57.620
You unleash one evil queen on a kingdom
and that's, like, all you've ever done.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.456
[Elfo] Yee-haw! Battle speed!

09:00.540 --> 09:01.999
-[both exclaim]
-[water splashing]

09:02.083 --> 09:03.626
Um, I'll be right back.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.589
[Elfo scatting]

09:10.716 --> 09:12.301
Elfo! Slow down!

09:12.385 --> 09:13.928
Wish I could, but I can't.

09:14.011 --> 09:16.722
True love only has one speed
and that is "breakneck."

09:16.806 --> 09:17.682
Right, Missy?

09:17.765 --> 09:19.100
-Whoo-hoo!
-Whoa!

09:19.934 --> 09:21.269
Who the hell is Missy?

09:21.352 --> 09:24.272
Miss Adventure.
The name is right there on her ass.

09:24.355 --> 09:25.940
I call her "Missy" for short.

09:26.023 --> 09:29.402
Tell me what drugs you're on
so I know what to do when you pass out.

09:29.485 --> 09:30.611
Also, where are the drugs?

09:30.695 --> 09:33.864
It's not drugs, silly.
It's pure, uncut love.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.783
And I'm overdosin'!

09:35.866 --> 09:37.952
When I die, do not resuscitate.

09:38.452 --> 09:40.538
Also, the drugs are in Missy's tacklebox.

09:40.621 --> 09:41.956
[howls]

09:42.039 --> 09:43.791
[Elfo continues exclaiming]

09:43.874 --> 09:45.960
Bow chicka wow wow!

09:46.043 --> 09:47.378
Elfo's lost his mind.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.880
Still, that does sound
better than sad Elfo.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.341
Is there a stable Elfo
that I haven't met yet?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.259
Not really.

09:53.342 --> 09:57.179
One time, I rescued him from Hell and
he thanked me by being pissy for weeks.

09:57.263 --> 10:00.224
Another time, he got mad at me
for making him stand in the garden

10:00.308 --> 10:02.476
until my mail-order garden gnome arrived.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.769
[scoffing] I paid him!

10:04.270 --> 10:05.229
Wait, no, I didn't.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.064
I mean, I will. Whatever!

10:07.148 --> 10:10.276
And this one time,
Elfo got super weird when we were high

10:10.359 --> 10:13.070
and, like, I maybe, kinda,
maybe kissed him.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.656
Shut up! You're dating Elfo?

10:15.740 --> 10:16.699
No. I mean, I…

10:17.199 --> 10:19.243
I've never dated anyone.

10:19.827 --> 10:20.661
Really?

10:21.162 --> 10:23.956
I mean, yeah. No… I'm… Or no, I haven't.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.916
Okay, we're gonna have a talk.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.961
It can't be any worse than
the talks I've had inside my own head.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.673
Like, "Hey, Bean, why are you so lonely?"

10:32.757 --> 10:35.551
"I don't know,
maybe because nobody loves me."

10:35.635 --> 10:37.803
"Maybe you don't deserve to be loved

10:37.887 --> 10:39.847
because that's just
not in the cards for you."

10:39.930 --> 10:40.765
"But maybe it is!"

10:40.848 --> 10:43.225
"I don't know.
You know, everyone else has it."

10:43.309 --> 10:45.603
"Yeah, I've thought about that! Duh!"

10:45.686 --> 10:48.105
"What am I, walkin' around,
not thinking about anybody?"

10:48.189 --> 10:49.398
"I don't know, maybe you are."

10:49.482 --> 10:51.275
[scoffs] "Well, yeah, maybe."

10:51.359 --> 10:53.235
"Maybe 'cause
you talk to yourself constantly."

10:53.319 --> 10:55.321
"Who doesn't
talk to themselves constantly?"

10:55.404 --> 10:57.323
"There's an inner monologue
goin' all the time."

10:57.406 --> 11:01.035
"Nope, that is not the case
for everybody else. No, sirree."

11:01.118 --> 11:03.412
"Don't call me 'sirree.'"

11:03.496 --> 11:05.706
[groans] "I am out there."

11:05.790 --> 11:06.999
"I don't see you out there."

11:07.083 --> 11:12.338
"I am so out there! Like, anyone else
that sees me is like, 'She's out there.'"

11:12.421 --> 11:13.839
"You're not out there at all."

11:13.923 --> 11:16.634
"Ugh, I am, like, accessible."

11:16.717 --> 11:18.886
[blows raspberry] "What?"

11:18.969 --> 11:23.140
"You know what?
This is why I just hate talking to you."

11:23.224 --> 11:25.434
"You have no idea what I'm really saying."

11:25.518 --> 11:27.728
"I'm trying to say one thing
and you interpret it…"

11:27.812 --> 11:28.938
"Like, you're not listening."

11:29.021 --> 11:30.731
"No! You're not listening!"

11:30.815 --> 11:33.150
"Uh-uh. I am so listening!"

11:33.234 --> 11:34.485
[yells]

11:34.568 --> 11:37.029
Hey, Mora.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.241
-You're here still.
-[laughs]

11:40.324 --> 11:41.784
What? Why are you laughing?

11:41.867 --> 11:43.160
You're so weird.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.286
[rumbling]

11:48.874 --> 11:50.918
Uh, small issue with the boat,
but don't worry,

11:51.001 --> 11:54.588
I got a lot of experience with
relationships coming to a grinding halt.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.096
-[clattering]
-[Elfo] Ow!

12:02.179 --> 12:04.140
Wait, sorry. What were we talking about?

12:04.223 --> 12:07.226
Oh, wait, yeah, your pathetic love life.
Sorry, yes, continue.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.519
I don't know.

12:08.602 --> 12:11.230
I have done, like,
so much with so many people,

12:11.313 --> 12:15.943
and, like, kissed, and like…
And, like, touched stuff,

12:16.026 --> 12:19.864
and, like, moved around,
and, like, talked.

12:19.947 --> 12:23.242
-But then why is it not leading to dating?
-I don't know.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.785
I haven't done any of those things.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.912
I have kissed a bunch
of people and animals.

12:26.996 --> 12:30.166
Hey, Bean, can I ask you
a serious question?

12:30.875 --> 12:32.543
Why are you wearing just one boot?

12:32.626 --> 12:34.295
I can't tell what's broken.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.297
I have no idea what I'm looking at.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.062
I wish all you gals came with a diagram.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.273
Oh, wait, it's upside down.

12:57.568 --> 12:58.694
Take it off, Bean.

12:58.777 --> 13:03.741
I don't know, I love this boot.
We've been through a lot together.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.701
And what if I find my other boot?

13:06.285 --> 13:07.453
-[water splashes]
-Hey!

13:07.536 --> 13:08.454
Thanks, though.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.331
[clanking and crashing]

13:12.666 --> 13:13.667
[Elfo grunts]

13:14.168 --> 13:16.587
-[clanking continues]
-[Elfo grunts] Damn it!

13:16.670 --> 13:18.589
Elfo? Are you okay down there?

13:18.672 --> 13:19.507
Oh, sure.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.092
Missy and I are just having
a little lovers' spat.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.385
[thudding and hissing]

13:24.512 --> 13:26.180
No, that's not what I said.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.723
That's not what I meant.

13:27.806 --> 13:30.059
No, I'm not going to apologize anymore.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.186
-No!
-[steam hisses]

13:32.269 --> 13:33.437
[Elfo sobbing] I'm sorry!

13:33.521 --> 13:35.147
I'm so sorry!

13:35.940 --> 13:37.399
Stop looking at me like that!

13:37.483 --> 13:40.611
I'm so vulnerable and you're so mean.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.404
Can we just kiss?

13:42.488 --> 13:44.365
That always solves everything.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.408
[continues sobbing] Please!

13:47.076 --> 13:48.786
-Elfo?
-Yeah?

13:48.869 --> 13:50.037
Are you sure you're okay?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.372
[Elfo] Totally fine!

13:51.455 --> 13:53.791
Why don't I just
swim you guys back to Dreamland?

13:53.874 --> 13:55.751
Thanks, but I'm not real into drowning.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.212
If you hold my hand,
you can breathe underwater.

13:58.295 --> 13:59.129
Really?

13:59.213 --> 14:02.633
Hey, Elfo, get up here.
Mora's gonna swim us back to Dreamland.

14:02.716 --> 14:06.178
You two do whatever you want,
but I'm not abandoning Missy.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.806
Ugh. Heartbreak can make you so crazy.

14:08.889 --> 14:11.183
Like, okay, I don't share this often,

14:11.267 --> 14:14.687
but, like, a couple years back,
I fell deeply in love.

14:14.770 --> 14:18.232
I was so happy. It was pure bliss.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.234
But then one day, splash! It was over.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.152
I was devastated. So you know what I did?

14:22.236 --> 14:23.070
What?

14:23.153 --> 14:26.824
I found a giant piece of soggy driftwood,
dragged it up onto the beach.

14:26.907 --> 14:30.703
I let the sun dry it out, and then I
whittled it into a life-size copy of her.

14:30.786 --> 14:33.247
Wow! That's beautiful.

14:33.330 --> 14:36.500
And then I chopped it
into tiny, little pieces and I burned it.

14:37.751 --> 14:40.880
In a way, you're kind of lucky
you've never had a real romance.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.173
Yeah. [slurps]

14:45.926 --> 14:46.802
[groans]

14:46.886 --> 14:47.887
[grunts]

14:49.221 --> 14:50.222
Hmm!

14:58.355 --> 14:59.732
[engine idling]

15:04.403 --> 15:06.322
All I had to do was put a ring on it.

15:26.091 --> 15:29.345
So, how do you know about…
What's it called? Astrophysics?

15:29.428 --> 15:32.890
Mermaids navigate by the night sky.
Sailors stole that from us.

15:32.973 --> 15:36.018
They actually used to get everywhere
by following really long strings.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.979
And you see those dots?
They're actually big dots.

15:39.063 --> 15:42.191
Some people call them stars,
but that's speculative.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.861
And then that, right there,
is a constellation called the Big Flipper.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.238
It's a heavenly mermaid,
such as yours truly.

15:48.322 --> 15:53.535
That's her head, that's her hair,
that's her waist, and that's her tail.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.955
And that bright pulsing dot
right in the middle?

15:56.038 --> 15:58.499
That's her heart.
So, do you know what a heart is?

15:58.582 --> 16:00.334
Yes, I understand subtext.

16:00.417 --> 16:03.212
Then those four stars that curve up
and then that one there?

16:03.295 --> 16:04.838
That's her quiver and her arrow.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.383
They say she killed
a lot of humans with her fish-bow.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.300
Cool.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.219
After she died
in The Battle of Falling Water,

16:10.302 --> 16:13.180
she appeared in the sky
to illuminate the way to Mermaid Island,

16:13.263 --> 16:14.098
our new homeland.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.187
Oh, my gosh, Bean, look!
It's a shooting star.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.188
I didn't see it.

16:23.440 --> 16:28.070
So, you know anything else interesting
about the world up there in the dots?

16:28.153 --> 16:30.656
Mermaid scientists
believe that in the future,

16:30.739 --> 16:32.783
ships will carry us up to space.

16:32.866 --> 16:36.120
And someday, a mermaid
will set fins on the Moon.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.542
[yawns] Someday.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.298
-[water splashes]
-[gasps]

16:59.268 --> 17:00.477
[seagulls squawking]

17:08.986 --> 17:11.572
-Hey, where's Mora?
-I don't know.

17:11.655 --> 17:12.531
What happened?

17:12.614 --> 17:14.575
I woke up and she was gone.

17:14.658 --> 17:17.244
This whole thing feels like a weird dream.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.955
Or scurvy. When does scurvy kick in?

17:32.217 --> 17:34.803
[Bean] I can't see anything!
Elfo, be careful!

17:34.887 --> 17:37.306
Stop fretting,
we're in the middle of the ocean.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.932
-[loud crash]
-[Bean screams]

17:40.434 --> 17:41.351

17:42.895 --> 17:44.646
-[Elfo grunts]
-[water splashes]

17:44.730 --> 17:46.523
Oh, no. She's hurt.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.400
And Bean, you, too.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.027
I'll scamper off and get help.

17:52.196 --> 17:55.991
[Bean groans] Here come the spins,
and I'm not even drunk.

17:59.912 --> 18:00.829
[Mora] Bean?

18:02.831 --> 18:03.832
Bean!

18:06.794 --> 18:07.795
Come on!

18:08.462 --> 18:10.881
I really shouldn't swim
with this head wound.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.050
Maybe that's just
your head wound speaking.

18:13.133 --> 18:13.967
Jump in!

18:19.932 --> 18:21.683
[dreamy whimsical music playing]

19:01.348 --> 19:03.183
That was amazing.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.310
Just a sec. [retches]

19:07.396 --> 19:08.814
[coughing and gagging]

19:11.859 --> 19:13.360
Next time, keep your mouth closed.

19:13.443 --> 19:16.363
I should've mentioned that. I don't
like to open my mouth underwater.

19:16.446 --> 19:17.739
Why'd you come back for me?

19:17.823 --> 19:20.033
I left because
I didn't want to get hurt again,

19:20.117 --> 19:23.120
and I came back because I'll never learn.

19:23.871 --> 19:24.872
[retches]

19:25.539 --> 19:27.958
Lock up the sangria, Mora's back!

19:28.041 --> 19:29.042
[sighs]

19:30.460 --> 19:31.837
Time to face the family.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.257
Mora!

19:35.340 --> 19:37.176
Mom! I'm alive.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.093
Don't be mad.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.222
Oh, I thought we lost you.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.932
-So, where have you been?
-Away.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.475
-Did the mermaid hunters get ya?
-No.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.060
-You bring us anything?
-No.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.979
-It better not be a shell bracelet.
-[Mora] It isn't.

19:49.062 --> 19:49.980
Or shell anything.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.481
[Mora] I said I didn't bring you anything.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.359
Ladies, let's give Mora some space.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.237
I'm sure she's exhausted
from the long swim.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.572
Actually, I'm good.

19:58.655 --> 20:01.241
Uh, my friend gave me a ride
most of the way home on her boat.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.826
Boat? You mean…

20:02.910 --> 20:05.537
Hey, yeah, uh, human here.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.247
[all gasp]

20:07.331 --> 20:08.874
What is that, a foot bone?

20:08.957 --> 20:11.543
Oh, I remember you, you're Zøg's daughter.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.878
[all murmuring]

20:13.712 --> 20:15.923
She's okay, for a drowner.

20:16.006 --> 20:18.884
You must've been desperate
to take a ride from a human.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.177
That's enough, Rhonda!

20:21.136 --> 20:23.388
My eldest daughter has come home.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.767
Let us celebrate her return
and jubilantly proclaim…

20:26.850 --> 20:28.143
"We told you so."

20:28.227 --> 20:32.314
We told you so!
We told you so! We told you so!

20:32.397 --> 20:33.982
[drums beating]

20:34.900 --> 20:36.235
[conch shell blowing]

20:38.320 --> 20:40.572
You failed as an actress
and as a daughter,

20:40.656 --> 20:44.993
but you've come back to Mermaid Island
to resume the role you were born to play.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.828
[all] Princess Mora!

20:46.912 --> 20:48.163
-[Mora] Whoo!
-[all] Whoo!

21:03.095 --> 21:04.221

21:14.273 --> 21:16.858
How come you never told me
you're a princess, too?

21:16.942 --> 21:19.152
[chuckles] Do you go around
broadcasting it?

21:19.236 --> 21:23.407
No, of course not.
But I don't know what broadcasting is.

21:24.616 --> 21:25.617
[slurps]

21:27.619 --> 21:29.496
Gee, Bean, you must really like mermaids.

21:29.579 --> 21:32.749
I mean, first Saphyria,
now Mora. [chuckles]

21:32.833 --> 21:34.334
What are you talking about?

21:34.418 --> 21:39.006
Oh, so I guess Bean didn't tell you about
her late-night earlobe-nibbling escapade?

21:39.089 --> 21:40.299
[imitates gobbling sound]

21:40.382 --> 21:43.385
Whoa. There's no slobber
in a good lobing, okay?

21:43.468 --> 21:46.096
Rhonda, I don't care
what Bean did in the past, okay?

21:46.179 --> 21:47.681
Stop trying to start trouble.

21:47.764 --> 21:51.393
Come on, Bean. I want to show you
an amazing place you haven't been before.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.853
Is it another beach?

21:52.936 --> 21:53.770
Yeah.

21:59.359 --> 22:02.863
I used to come here when I wanted
to get away and forget everything.

22:02.946 --> 22:05.198
You guys really need a swim-up bar.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.742
I made something for you.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.202
You have pockets in your fins?

22:09.286 --> 22:12.497
It's called a gift bladder
for carrying small tokens and stuff.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.415
Here.

22:15.375 --> 22:16.752
A little gold sea star.

in the constellation.

I'm not gonna ask
where you pulled that from.
