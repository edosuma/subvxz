00:01.700 --> 00:03.700
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis.</i>

00:03.900 --> 00:05.700
I'd like to report for duty, ma'am.

00:06.100 --> 00:06.700
<i>Lieutenant!</i>

00:07.100 --> 00:08.100
What do you think you're doing here?

00:08.140 --> 00:09.700
- Just give me something to do.
- I don't think so.

00:09.740 --> 00:10.700
Don't push me around!

00:10.900 --> 00:12.100
Where's the rest of the enzyme?

00:13.300 --> 00:14.900
Lt Ford might have been your friend,

00:14.940 --> 00:16.100
but he's not anymore.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.900
We are only here searching for a friend.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.460
You guys all think I'm crazy or something.

00:21.500 --> 00:22.300
No, no-one thinks that.

00:22.340 --> 00:23.580
<i>We think we can help him,</i>

00:23.620 --> 00:24.700
if we can find him.

00:24.740 --> 00:26.460
This drug is messing with your head!

00:26.500 --> 00:27.300
I'm not just fine.

00:27.700 --> 00:28.700
I'm better than fine.

00:32.100 --> 00:32.900
Lieutenant!

00:33.900 --> 00:34.700
<i>Don't!</i>

00:38.100 --> 00:38.900
Ford!

00:41.100 --> 00:42.260
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

00:42.300 --> 00:44.900
<i>Well, keep complaining about it
and we may get there faster.</i>

00:44.940 --> 00:50.100
<i>Well, couldn't we have met these people on a tropical
beach planet, populated by tall, blonde women?</i>

00:50.140 --> 00:53.060
Whoever wants to speak with us,
obviously values their privacy.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.100
Yes, well I value my time and this is a waste of it.

00:55.140 --> 00:57.860
What's a waste of time, is listening to you, Rodney.
This is a mission.

00:57.900 --> 01:02.100
Yeah well, it strikes me that this is a mission better
suited to one of the... lower echelon teams.

01:02.140 --> 01:03.100
Lower echelon?

01:03.140 --> 01:04.700
He means to say, less important.

01:04.739 --> 01:07.500
Got a tip from one of Teyla's contacts.
We're following it up.

01:07.540 --> 01:10.900
And this is like what? The umpteenth tip
we've followed up in search of a ZedPM?

01:10.940 --> 01:11.620
Rodney?

01:11.660 --> 01:13.900
Look, I just want to make it clear
that every second I am out of my lab

01:13.940 --> 01:16.900
is a second the galaxy goes
without another ground-breaking...

01:25.900 --> 01:28.900
We have to get them through the Gate
before their people realise they are missing.

01:51.300 --> 01:52.500
You guys OK?

01:53.700 --> 01:55.300
Oh yeah, fine.

01:56.300 --> 01:59.300
Seems like a whole lot of trouble to go through,
just to get us to dinner.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.500
Not a talkative bunch, are you.

02:05.540 --> 02:07.300
We'll release you from your bindings

02:07.340 --> 02:09.100
if you promise not to attack us.

02:09.900 --> 02:10.900
Sure.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.700
Yeah. We promise.

02:20.700 --> 02:23.300
Before we untie them,
they had to know that they are among friends.

02:25.100 --> 02:26.100
Ford?

02:27.300 --> 02:29.100
Thought I was dead, didn't you Sheppard?

03:37.750 --> 03:38.350
Guys.

03:39.150 --> 03:40.150
Guys please.

03:40.190 --> 03:40.750
Eat!

03:41.950 --> 03:42.550
<i>Eat.</i>

03:46.750 --> 03:49.150
<i>Well men,
this used to be my team.</i>

03:50.350 --> 03:51.150
Not this one.

03:51.350 --> 03:52.750
<i>But I think he's OK, too.</i>

03:52.950 --> 03:54.550
What is all this?

03:55.350 --> 03:56.950
Some local vegetables.

03:56.990 --> 03:58.550
A sorta alligator thingy.

03:58.590 --> 04:00.550
<i>Tastes like salted meat. It's good. Try.</i>

04:00.950 --> 04:03.750
I'm not talking about the food.
What the hell is going on?

04:03.790 --> 04:04.750
Who are these men?

04:04.790 --> 04:06.150
Why bring us here like this?

04:06.350 --> 04:07.350
That's a lot of questions.

04:07.550 --> 04:08.550
Pick one.

04:10.950 --> 04:11.750
Pick one.

04:11.790 --> 04:12.750
That's good.

04:13.150 --> 04:14.550
<i>Where did you find him, Sheppard?</i>

04:14.750 --> 04:17.950
Maybe you should start with how you managed
to escape being caught by the Wraith Dart?

04:19.350 --> 04:21.950
What? I get nervous, I get hungry.

04:24.750 --> 04:26.950
OK, the Dart.

04:28.750 --> 04:29.550
Ford!

04:39.950 --> 04:41.750
You're not getting off this planet!

04:48.550 --> 04:50.950
<i>I have no idea how long I was in the Dart.</i>

04:52.150 --> 04:53.950
<i>Next thing I knew, I was on a Cruiser</i>

04:55.150 --> 04:56.550
<i>and I was awake.</i>

04:56.950 --> 04:57.750
It's the enzyme.

04:57.950 --> 05:00.150
Makes you almost immune to a Wraith stunner, so

05:00.350 --> 05:01.750
when you're dematerialized from the Wraith Dart,

05:01.790 --> 05:03.150
you were awake as opposed to...

05:03.190 --> 05:04.350
As opposed to dead!

05:17.150 --> 05:19.150
I cut open it's enzyme pouch.

05:19.950 --> 05:20.950
Took my fill.

05:21.150 --> 05:22.550
Made my way off the ship.

05:24.350 --> 05:25.950
<i>You can get around pretty easy on a Wraith ship.</i>

05:25.990 --> 05:29.150
<i>They're not used to people making it aboard,
so there's next to no security.</i>

05:38.750 --> 05:41.350
I walked off with enough enzyme
to last me a little while.

05:41.390 --> 05:42.910
<i>Tracked down the stargate.</i>

05:42.950 --> 05:45.150
Dialled the first friendly address I could remember.

05:56.950 --> 05:59.150
I need a place to stay and a hot meal.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.950
And what do you got to trade?

06:07.150 --> 06:08.350
What'll that get me?

06:09.150 --> 06:10.150
No weapons.

06:15.150 --> 06:15.750
So?

06:16.750 --> 06:17.750
What'll that get me?

06:21.950 --> 06:23.550
I still don't really understand.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.350
Look at me. I got shot.

06:25.390 --> 06:26.350
I healed.

06:26.750 --> 06:29.150
I can see farther. Clearer than I ever saw before.

06:29.190 --> 06:30.750
<i>I told them about the enzyme.</i>

06:31.550 --> 06:33.950
<i>How it makes you stronger and more aware.</i>

06:33.990 --> 06:35.150
<i>More resilient.</i>

06:35.550 --> 06:37.950
<i>How to give us a fighting chance against the Wraith.</i>

06:39.150 --> 06:40.350
I mean, look at me.

06:40.950 --> 06:41.950
Look at me!

06:45.950 --> 06:48.550
I walked off a Wraith Cruiser!

06:51.550 --> 06:52.550
It works.

06:52.750 --> 06:53.950
I wanna try it.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.550
<i>Wait a second.</i>

06:58.950 --> 07:00.150
All your people here.

07:01.150 --> 07:02.150
All your men.

07:02.750 --> 07:03.950
They're on the enzyme?

07:04.950 --> 07:05.750
Of course.

07:27.230 --> 07:27.950
No!

07:28.350 --> 07:30.350
We don't do it like that anymore.

07:31.150 --> 07:32.550
Let's get him back home.

07:34.350 --> 07:37.950
<i>As our numbers kept growing,
we needed more and more of the enzyme.</i>

07:55.550 --> 07:56.550
Nice work.

07:56.950 --> 07:57.750
Thank you.

07:58.550 --> 08:00.550
<i>This should give us a steady stream of the enzyme.</i>

08:02.350 --> 08:04.350
Time to focus on some bigger issues.

08:07.750 --> 08:08.550
<i>Aiden.</i>

08:08.750 --> 08:12.950
Do you mean to tell us that there are
live Wraith here in this cave?

08:13.950 --> 08:14.750
That's right.

08:15.950 --> 08:18.950
The Wraith can communicate
with each other over a distance.

08:19.750 --> 08:20.910
But not between stars.

08:21.950 --> 08:23.910
<i>They'd have to be in this solar system.</i>

08:23.950 --> 08:24.950
You taught me that.

08:25.350 --> 08:27.350
Yes well, good for me.

08:28.950 --> 08:31.150
It doesn't matter.
They can't communicate if they're unconscious.

08:32.350 --> 08:33.549
Why'd you jump us?

08:35.150 --> 08:37.350
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

08:37.390 --> 08:38.750
It was the only way to get you here.

08:38.789 --> 08:40.950
Why didn't you just tell us where you were?
You know we would have come.

08:40.990 --> 08:42.350
Yeah, you and a special ops team.

08:42.390 --> 08:43.350
No, no!

08:44.150 --> 08:45.350
I know you think I'm crazy.

08:47.550 --> 08:49.550
I brought you all here to show you that you're wrong.

08:50.150 --> 08:52.750
I mean, do I look crazy?

08:53.750 --> 08:56.350
Do I seem out of control?

08:56.550 --> 08:58.950
Are we speaking in relative terms, or...

08:58.990 --> 09:02.150
Look. Jace here has really fine tuned the enzyme.

09:02.550 --> 09:05.550
We know how to administer it now and to regulate it.
Refine with it.

09:05.590 --> 09:07.550
We've gotten so good we can even lace food with it.

09:11.750 --> 09:12.750
Excuse me?

09:13.350 --> 09:14.350
Congratulations.

09:14.750 --> 09:16.350
You've just had your first dose.

09:16.950 --> 09:17.750
What?

09:18.950 --> 09:22.150
I thought long and hard about how
to show you that the enzyme was safe.

09:23.550 --> 09:26.550
To convince you that it was the first step
to defeating the Wraith.

09:26.590 --> 09:27.910
So you could convince Weir.

09:27.950 --> 09:29.910
- Convince the military.
- Are you out of your mind?

09:29.950 --> 09:31.750
- Hey! Settle down, McKay!
- No I will not settle down!

09:31.790 --> 09:33.750
I have been drugged against my will,
you little punk!

09:33.790 --> 09:35.350
You should not have done this Aiden!

09:35.550 --> 09:36.950
Be as mad as you want.

09:36.990 --> 09:39.310
Couple of days, you'll be thanking me.

09:39.350 --> 09:41.150
We'll all have a good laugh about this.
Now eat up.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.950
I'm itchy. I'm itchy all over.

09:45.990 --> 09:48.350
This is exactly what happened
when I toked pot once in college.

09:48.390 --> 09:50.150
Everyone stay put.

09:51.950 --> 09:52.750
Let him go.

09:55.750 --> 09:56.350
Ford!

09:57.550 --> 09:58.150
Look.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.750
I know what you're trying to do. I get it, I do.

10:00.790 --> 10:02.750
But you're going about his all wrong.

10:02.790 --> 10:05.750
Weir isn't going to listen to us
if we're all hopped up on the enzyme.

10:05.950 --> 10:07.150
Your food was clean.

10:10.150 --> 10:11.350
Why?
Why me?

10:12.350 --> 10:13.750
You're gonna be the witness.

10:13.790 --> 10:18.950
You're gonna be the one to tell Weir,
that her most trusted team has taken
the enzyme and is better because of it.

10:19.350 --> 10:20.550
Look buddy.

10:21.350 --> 10:24.150
Why don't you come back with us.
Have Beckett look you over?

10:24.190 --> 10:25.950
- That's the best proof.
- No.

10:27.150 --> 10:28.550
No, I've thought this through.

10:28.590 --> 10:29.750
This is the plan.

10:31.950 --> 10:34.950
- Look, I don't know what you're thinking...
- You're free to roam around as much as you want.

10:37.150 --> 10:38.750
You're all a part of the team, now.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.160
OK.
So why aren't these guys watching us?

10:48.200 --> 10:49.200
Ronon is right.

10:49.240 --> 10:52.000
They went to great trouble to get us here.
Why would they allow us to leave?

10:52.040 --> 10:53.400
Just waiting for the other shoe to drop.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.000
Oh, that little bastard!

10:55.200 --> 10:57.200
- There it goes.
- See, this is what I was afraid of.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.000
What'd he do?

10:58.040 --> 10:59.800
He's taken all the necessary control crystals.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.600
Something I showed him how to do on a mission,
I might add!

11:01.800 --> 11:02.800
Well, that's not good.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.800
That is the understatement of the year.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.160
Alright! See what you can do!

11:06.200 --> 11:08.000
OK, why don't we just take them?

11:08.040 --> 11:10.400
All we gotta do is get our hands on one stunner.
I can take them all.

11:10.440 --> 11:14.800
Yeah, maybe, but if we mess it up, whatever trust
we might have been given, will disappear.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.800
You wanna make them trust us?

11:16.840 --> 11:20.360
We play it cool, we let 'em get comfortable.
They're bound to make a mistake.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.000
And in the meantime?

11:22.200 --> 11:23.600
We play along.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.200
How are you guys feeling?

11:29.600 --> 11:31.200
I didn't eat that much.
I feel fine.

11:31.240 --> 11:34.800
Perhaps if we were able to fast, they would be
unable to administer the enzyme.

11:34.840 --> 11:37.600
I doubt that.
I don't think they'd have a problem forcing us.

11:37.640 --> 11:40.760
This thing is useless and I ate my face off.
And I can tell you, I can feel it working!

11:40.800 --> 11:43.000
There's a good possibility that everything
you're feeling right now might be

11:43.040 --> 11:44.680
- psychosomatic.
- Oh, is that right, Professor Science?

11:44.720 --> 11:46.360
Is that your expert opinion?

11:46.400 --> 11:47.360
Yes it is.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.200
<i>Well I can tell you, when they up the dosage,</i>

11:49.240 --> 11:52.000
<i>the side effects will be very real
and very unpredictable.</i>

11:53.650 --> 11:55.050
<i>You're back early.</i>

11:55.250 --> 11:58.310
Janev's kind of a closed society.

11:58.311 --> 12:02.250
Very polite, very courteous, but completely
uninterested in having anything to do with us.

12:02.290 --> 12:04.450
Well better that than hostile, I suppose.

12:05.550 --> 12:06.910
Colonel Sheppard's team.

12:06.950 --> 12:08.350
Three hours overdue.

12:08.390 --> 12:09.750
It wouldn't be the first time.

12:09.790 --> 12:10.950
Any radio contact?

12:11.350 --> 12:12.750
None since they left.

12:13.550 --> 12:14.950
Well, you know those guys.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.150
What do I know about those guys?

12:18.150 --> 12:21.150
Just that they tend to get all caught up
in whatever it is they're doing

12:21.190 --> 12:23.550
and sometimes they don't check in.

12:23.590 --> 12:25.150
They forget how much you worry.

12:26.550 --> 12:27.950
We worry.

12:27.990 --> 12:30.350
- Collectively, I mean.
- Yes we do.

12:31.550 --> 12:32.950
Yeah, we do.

12:32.990 --> 12:34.950
OK guys, looks like we're heading back out.

12:35.070 --> 12:36.110
Thank you Major.

12:36.150 --> 12:37.150
You're welcome.

12:38.350 --> 12:39.740
<i>Seriously! I'm getting... </i>

12:39.751 --> 12:43.351
I'm getting... chills, hot flashes,
chills and hot flashes again and again.

12:43.390 --> 12:44.550
None of you are feeling that?

12:44.750 --> 12:47.510
The enzyme side effects are gonna be
the least of his concerns if he keeps this up.

12:47.550 --> 12:48.950
I know. Just be patient.

12:48.990 --> 12:50.550
Historically,
that hasn't been a strength for me.

12:50.590 --> 12:51.350
I know!

12:52.150 --> 12:53.350
Sheppard, Teyla!

12:55.750 --> 12:58.150
Kanayo's running a mission offworld.
I want you to go with him.

12:58.190 --> 12:58.910
Why?

12:58.950 --> 13:00.150
We're running an op.

13:00.190 --> 13:02.350
Time you might wanna see the men in action.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.550
Sure!
Wherever you need us.

13:05.590 --> 13:06.950
Just give us some weapons and...

13:07.030 --> 13:08.390
<i>Nice try.</i>

13:08.590 --> 13:10.590
No, you're gonna hang back and watch with Kanayo.

13:10.670 --> 13:12.750
Don't worry, you won't be in any danger.

13:12.790 --> 13:14.110
That's a load off my mind.

13:14.150 --> 13:14.790
Good.

13:14.790 --> 13:16.390
What about us?

13:17.590 --> 13:19.870
Jace'll give you the grand tour.
Show you what we've done with the place.

13:19.910 --> 13:20.710
<i>How's that sound?</i>

13:20.750 --> 13:22.110
Oh, it sounds delightful.

13:22.150 --> 13:26.950
Good, good. Then if Sheppard tries anything offworld,
you'll be nice and close for me to kill you both.

13:26.990 --> 13:29.910
Can't think of a better way of spending the afternoon.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.470
Move!

13:33.310 --> 13:35.310
Looks like he's asking you to go.

14:03.390 --> 14:05.150
Are those guards Genii?

14:05.310 --> 14:06.430
Yes.

14:07.070 --> 14:08.710
What exactly are we doing here?

14:08.750 --> 14:10.710
The Genii have spies all over the galaxy.

14:10.750 --> 14:14.790
For whatever reason, if one of them can't
make it back to the Genii homeworld,
their leaders have established safehouses.

14:14.830 --> 14:17.670
<i>When they need a place to unload on
gear or a place to hide, they come here.</i>

14:17.710 --> 14:18.510
That's useful.

14:18.550 --> 14:21.190
Yeah, we've found it to be an excellent
source of information and supplies.

14:21.230 --> 14:23.870
How did you find them in the first place?

14:24.230 --> 14:26.350
I was a Genii spy.

14:29.550 --> 14:31.710
If you're one of them,
why don't you just walk in there.

14:31.750 --> 14:34.670
Well I used to, but eventually
they realised that I'd betrayed them.

14:34.710 --> 14:36.590
I can see how they would.

14:37.070 --> 14:38.510
We rely on raids now.

14:38.510 --> 14:40.270
Why? What more do you guys want?

14:40.310 --> 14:42.670
We don't have all the pieces we need for the Lt's plan.

14:42.710 --> 14:46.150
Right. And which plan would that be, again?

14:46.190 --> 14:48.310
All will be revealed when the time is right.

14:48.350 --> 14:52.470
Well, good. I hate for things to be revealed too early.

14:55.710 --> 14:57.870
<i>How are you powering these Genii computers?</i>

14:57.910 --> 14:59.550
We stole a Talnoran generator.

14:59.590 --> 15:02.070
They're a pain to keep serviced, but they do the job.

15:02.110 --> 15:05.270
Actually, we just got
our hands on some Palation solar cells,

15:05.310 --> 15:08.990
but I haven't been able to figure out how to
interface them yet. Have you used them before?

15:09.030 --> 15:11.070
Can't say that I have.
What do you, what do you do here?

15:11.110 --> 15:11.910
We study the Wraith.

15:11.950 --> 15:13.630
Oh yeah? How's that going?

15:13.670 --> 15:16.950
Some of our discoveries,
have been quite exciting, actually.

15:16.990 --> 15:18.350
Like what?

15:18.390 --> 15:22.110
Well for one, they seem to be territorial.

15:22.150 --> 15:26.070
Very much so, it turns out.
They're not a united foe, like we once believed.

15:26.110 --> 15:26.790
Really.

15:26.830 --> 15:29.870
<i>Yes, in fact I believe
they're fractioning even further.</i>

15:29.910 --> 15:33.310
Now, my understanding of
their language is fairly limited,

15:33.350 --> 15:38.190
but they seem to be trying to establish a system
that would restrict intership communications.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.750
<i>What? Why would they stop
sharing information with each other.</i>

15:40.750 --> 15:43.710
Ford thinks it might have to do
with your friend's ability to read their minds.

15:43.750 --> 15:48.310
If she taps into them, only one ship
would be compromised, not the whole fleet.

15:48.390 --> 15:49.870
What, all this because of Teyla?

15:50.390 --> 15:53.350
Well for one, she may not be
the only one that possesses that ability.

15:53.390 --> 15:55.310
Fair enough.

15:55.350 --> 16:01.870
And two. I think that the lack
of food in the galaxy has created
some deep divisions within the Wraith cells.

16:03.350 --> 16:05.150
And you got all that from...

16:05.750 --> 16:06.430
this?

16:06.870 --> 16:07.470
Yes.

16:08.630 --> 16:10.910
To be honest, I could use some help.

16:10.950 --> 16:12.270
How's your Wraith, Doctor?

16:13.150 --> 16:16.470
It's OK. Let me see what you got.

16:29.910 --> 16:31.430
That's better.

16:32.030 --> 16:34.790
<i>You guys still need to work together.</i>

16:35.830 --> 16:37.990
We're stronger as a team.

16:40.910 --> 16:42.630
You wanna spar a little?

16:46.630 --> 16:48.550
We're cool, right?

16:49.030 --> 16:51.310
You're not holding a grudge or anything.

16:52.030 --> 16:54.390
I did save your life.

16:54.990 --> 16:56.750
I remember.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.270
You know, it's funny.

16:59.270 --> 17:02.910
If you ask a dozen people who they thought
would win in a fight between you and me,

17:02.950 --> 17:07.270
people would choose you, hands down.
Hell, I'd choose you.

17:07.550 --> 17:09.630
But we went toe to toe.

17:10.150 --> 17:11.069
Yeah, we did.

17:11.109 --> 17:12.829
Till Sheppard showed up.

17:13.349 --> 17:15.710
So I guess it's still undecided.

17:15.829 --> 17:20.069
Look, all I'm saying is,
why do you think I was able to fight you like that?

17:20.109 --> 17:21.750
It's the enzyme.

17:22.630 --> 17:24.270
Look what it did for me.

17:24.310 --> 17:27.109
Imagine what it could do for you.

17:28.069 --> 17:31.550
I'm not the bad guy here, Ronon.
I'm just trying to help.

17:34.710 --> 17:38.190
You'll come around.
I know you will.

17:43.150 --> 17:45.990
We've just finished our scans, Ma'am.
They're not here.

17:46.030 --> 17:47.910
Do you think they've headed to another planet?

17:47.950 --> 17:53.270
It's possible, but as you know,
it's standard procedure to check in and tell us first.
They didn't do that, so...

17:53.310 --> 17:55.950
They might have been taken offworld against their will.

17:56.150 --> 17:57.350
Yeah.

17:58.990 --> 18:02.670
Alright. Can you get me
the last few addresses dialled from that DHD?

18:03.750 --> 18:07.510
Maybe somebody can,
but that's a little out of my skill set.

18:07.590 --> 18:09.310
I'll send Zelenka.

18:09.350 --> 18:12.030
Good call. Lorne out.

18:16.430 --> 18:18.310
So, what's the plan?

18:18.350 --> 18:19.910
We take them by force.

18:20.030 --> 18:22.030
That's some ground-breaking strategy there.

18:22.070 --> 18:25.350
I think the Colonel is interested
in the type of attack.

18:25.390 --> 18:27.470
We plan to overpower them.

18:27.470 --> 18:30.630
I think it's best if we just watch.

18:36.150 --> 18:37.230
Now.

18:45.150 --> 18:46.910
What kind of plan is that?

18:46.910 --> 18:47.870
One that works.

18:47.910 --> 18:49.390
One of your men got hit.

18:49.430 --> 18:52.630
Well it should be safe for us now.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.550
This guy's dead.

18:59.590 --> 19:01.870
So you see, you are not invincible.

19:01.910 --> 19:03.590
We're close enough.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.630
There are skills to the art of war, Kanayo.

19:05.670 --> 19:09.310
Don't you tell me how to run my missions.
You're just here to watch.

19:17.070 --> 19:18.950
Look familiar?

19:18.990 --> 19:20.590
It's our C4.

19:20.630 --> 19:22.110
We're stealing it back.

19:22.150 --> 19:23.030
For what purpose?

19:23.070 --> 19:24.710
For the Hive.

19:24.950 --> 19:26.350
As in hive ship?

19:26.390 --> 19:28.950
Yeah. That's the Lt's plan.

19:28.990 --> 19:33.230
You're gonna help us destroy a Wraith hive ship.

19:37.070 --> 19:39.550
One of the added bonuses
of killing the Wraith is,

19:39.590 --> 19:43.590
every now and again you get
your hands on a couple of these.

19:43.630 --> 19:46.830
Now thanks to Jace and some of the
computers that we borrowed from the Genii,

19:46.870 --> 19:50.150
we've been able to figure out the
exact flight path of one of their hive ships.

19:50.190 --> 19:53.390
It's decimating all inhabited worlds in it's path.

19:53.470 --> 19:55.030
It has to be stopped.

19:55.110 --> 19:59.390
I've been able to calculate that in the next several
days it'll be forced to make a hyperspace pause,

19:59.430 --> 20:01.270
<i>very near an unihabited planet.</i>

20:01.310 --> 20:03.030
that happens to have a stargate.

20:03.070 --> 20:07.390
We gate to that planet, get on a hive ship,
plant the C4 in the Dart Bay and get out.

20:07.430 --> 20:10.870
<i>We could save thousands, if not,
hundreds of thousands of lives.</i>

20:12.870 --> 20:13.670
So?

20:20.750 --> 20:21.510
You heard me.

20:21.550 --> 20:26.990
Let me see if I can couch what Colonel Sheppard
means by wow, in more explicit terms.

20:27.030 --> 20:28.510
That is a terrible plan.

20:28.550 --> 20:29.030
Rodney.

20:29.070 --> 20:31.430
Made all the more frightening by the
fact that you think it's a good plan.

20:31.430 --> 20:32.470
What's wrong with it?

20:32.510 --> 20:34.670
What's right with it?
Look, let's just for a second,

20:34.710 --> 20:39.990
give in to reckless abandon and assume
it would be possible to plant a single charge,
large enough to destroy an entire hive ship.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.750
We're planning on secondary explosions in the Dart Bay.

20:42.790 --> 20:43.830
Regardless!

20:43.870 --> 20:46.390
The hive ship will be on a hyperspace pause, yes,

20:46.390 --> 20:49.990
but it will not enter the planet's atmosphere.
Nor will it take up any sort of stable orbit.

20:50.030 --> 20:51.630
It will be flying through space.

20:51.670 --> 20:54.230
Which means, that unless your enzyme allows you
to jump higher than you've let on...

20:54.270 --> 20:55.630
We've a space ship.

20:55.670 --> 20:57.870
Oh yeah? Really.

20:57.910 --> 21:00.790
And what's it made out of? Bark?

21:01.230 --> 21:02.990
No, it's real, McKay.

21:03.230 --> 21:07.950
In fact, it's the only ship I'd feel
comfortable using on a mission like this.

21:20.510 --> 21:21.550
OK, where'd you get it?

21:21.590 --> 21:22.790
Does it matter?

21:22.950 --> 21:24.750
None of us has had much success flying it.

21:24.790 --> 21:27.670
Banged it up pretty bad in the last couple of landings.
It's in need of some repairs.

21:27.710 --> 21:29.270
And a real pilot.

21:29.390 --> 21:31.310
This is why you brought us here.

21:31.350 --> 21:33.070
It's the reason I've waited till now, yes.

21:33.110 --> 21:35.190
- Assuming this guy can get it working again.
<i>- He can.</i>

21:35.390 --> 21:37.070
These people are the best at what they do.

21:37.110 --> 21:40.230
Look, you fly, you scoop us up, you
take us to the Hive, you drop us off.

21:40.270 --> 21:42.230
All we need, is time to lay the charge.

21:42.270 --> 21:44.270
We'll be in and out of there before the
Wraith have any idea what's going on.

21:44.310 --> 21:45.270
It's perfect.

21:45.270 --> 21:46.750
It is far from perfect!

21:46.790 --> 21:48.830
But, it is possible.

21:48.870 --> 21:49.830
Colonel.

21:49.870 --> 21:51.710
What? Are you honestly considering this?

21:51.790 --> 21:53.590
It's on it's way to a culling, Rodney.

21:53.630 --> 21:56.150
Yeah and I am sorry about that,
but this is insane!

21:56.190 --> 21:57.790
Maybe not!

21:57.950 --> 22:01.830
Jace has been trying to get it working,
but he's not you, McKay.

22:02.150 --> 22:03.070
Can you fix it?

22:03.110 --> 22:04.030
Probably not.

22:04.070 --> 22:05.310
That usually means yes.

22:05.430 --> 22:07.670
Aren't you the one, not taking the enzyme?

22:07.710 --> 22:09.430
You're supposed to be the clear
voice of reason here.

22:09.470 --> 22:10.990
Look, can you fix it?

22:11.030 --> 22:15.990
Even if I could, I wouldn't. I'm sorry,
drug me all you want, I'm not doing this!

22:17.750 --> 22:20.190
Let me talk to him. He'll come around

22:20.230 --> 22:21.550
OK.

22:23.630 --> 22:23.990
Rodney!

22:24.070 --> 22:28.430
Look, maybe you are on the enzyme,
maybe Ford lied, because no rational
person would think that was a good plan.

22:28.470 --> 22:31.190
Look, a million things could go wrong,
I know that, but just...

22:31.230 --> 22:34.350
Look stop! Shut up and listen.

22:34.790 --> 22:38.950
You fix that Dart, we all get outta here. I know
it's risky, but Ford's not thinking straight, so...

22:38.990 --> 22:40.150
What are you talking about?

22:40.270 --> 22:42.950
I'll insist you're all on the away team.

22:42.990 --> 22:46.550
I'll scoop you up and instead of flying out
to the hive ship, we fly out to Atlantis.

22:46.590 --> 22:47.790
How?

22:47.830 --> 22:50.350
That Dart's gotta have it's own DHD, right?

22:50.390 --> 22:51.350
Of course.

22:51.390 --> 22:54.310
Well, you get that thing flight worthy, we all go home!

22:54.830 --> 22:56.750
Right, of course!

22:57.230 --> 23:00.950
You see, I would have thought of that myself,
before I became a drug addict.

23:00.990 --> 23:02.670
I'm sure you would have.

23:03.070 --> 23:05.030
I'm sorry.

23:05.670 --> 23:07.910
Alright. OK.

23:09.510 --> 23:10.910
<i>Damn it, this just doesn't work.</i>

23:10.950 --> 23:11.750
That good?

23:11.950 --> 23:15.030
These things are not designed to store Gate addresses.

23:15.070 --> 23:16.150
What can you give us?

23:16.190 --> 23:18.350
Well, every time the gate is dialled,

23:18.390 --> 23:21.550
it's like a residual imprint
is left on the control crystals.

23:21.590 --> 23:22.590
Which means?

23:22.630 --> 23:26.350
Well, I've managed to mine
about fifty addresses, but

23:26.390 --> 23:28.790
no idea if they're correct or
what order they were dialled in.

23:28.830 --> 23:31.230
Fifty? That's a lot of planets to check.

23:31.270 --> 23:34.310
Yes, And that's assuming that they're correct.

23:34.350 --> 23:36.630
OK, so long story short?

23:36.630 --> 23:41.870
It's going to be next to impossible
to find Colonel Sheppard and his team,
based on what I can get from this DHD.

23:41.910 --> 23:46.110
Great. OK, pack it up. Let's take what you've got.
We'll go over it on Atlantis.

23:46.150 --> 23:48.830
Weir's not gonna be happy about this.

23:51.190 --> 23:52.590
How'd that go?

23:54.470 --> 24:00.270
Well, he'll do it, but we need some conditions.

24:00.390 --> 24:01.670
What?

24:01.710 --> 24:03.950
Dial back McKay's enzyme doses.

24:03.990 --> 24:04.670
No!

24:04.710 --> 24:08.310
Look! We're under some time constraints here.
I'm not saying the enzyme wouldn't help.

24:08.350 --> 24:13.490
I'm saying, we need him standing still and
thinking, not running laps because it feels good.

24:16.310 --> 24:17.550
Ronon and Teyla?

24:17.590 --> 24:19.030
Stick to the plan.

24:20.430 --> 24:21.990
Fine, what else?

24:22.030 --> 24:25.950
I'll fly it, that's obvious, but I want
McKay, Teyla and Ronon on the strike team.

24:25.990 --> 24:27.950
It's not a good mission for McKay.

24:27.990 --> 24:29.350
<i>- It could get rough in there.
- Look,</i>

24:29.390 --> 24:33.510
suddenly we need a door opened, or a
computer hacked. McKay should be there to do it.

24:33.550 --> 24:35.470
That's why he's on my team in the first place.

24:38.630 --> 24:40.030
Is that it?

24:54.750 --> 24:55.350
No.

25:21.350 --> 25:23.550
No. You fire it up now, it'll only explode.

26:07.470 --> 26:08.270
OK.

26:17.630 --> 26:18.670
We're close.

26:26.190 --> 26:27.470
It's a good plan.

26:27.710 --> 26:29.990
I couldn't have done it without you, Sir.

26:30.030 --> 26:32.350
Well, I'm glad you trust me enough to bring me here.

26:37.350 --> 26:38.910
What's wrong?

26:40.670 --> 26:42.870
I wanna go home.

26:48.150 --> 26:49.350
Let's go.

26:49.750 --> 26:52.950
<i>Give McKay the DHD
crystals and let's get outta here.</i>

26:52.990 --> 26:55.390
I can have you back on Earth within an hour.

26:57.150 --> 26:57.950
No.

26:59.150 --> 27:00.550
<i>We have to do this first.</i>

27:01.790 --> 27:03.750
I have to prove to them that we can do this.

27:04.030 --> 27:06.470
You don't have to prove anything to anyone, Lieutenant.

27:15.070 --> 27:19.070
I saw your cousin and your Grandparents,
when I was back to Earth.

27:20.350 --> 27:23.390
They miss you.
A lot!

27:26.550 --> 27:29.150
This whole MIA thing is killing them.

27:29.190 --> 27:30.390
They're strong.

27:31.470 --> 27:32.710
They can wait.

27:34.750 --> 27:37.630
If anyone's ever going
to take me seriously ever again,

27:38.070 --> 27:39.390
we have to do this.

27:39.430 --> 27:40.430
Listen, Aiden...

27:40.470 --> 27:41.350
No.

27:43.550 --> 27:45.670
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna talk about this.

27:51.790 --> 27:55.430
Well, part of me thinks he brought us
here cos he knew we'd bring him back.

27:57.230 --> 28:01.030
I think subconsciously, he knows what
are plan is and he's fine with it.

28:08.070 --> 28:09.550
Give it back!

28:11.150 --> 28:12.750
Or what?

28:34.230 --> 28:36.190
Come on guys. Guys! Stop!

28:40.990 --> 28:43.270
What the hell's gotten into you two?

28:44.990 --> 28:48.950
Oh, right. Never mind.

28:51.390 --> 28:53.310
We need to talk about this?

28:53.350 --> 28:55.030
About what?

28:55.070 --> 28:56.030
<i>The enzyme works.</i>

28:56.190 --> 28:58.270
No-one's saying it,
but we're all thinking it.

28:58.310 --> 28:59.830
It works.

29:00.430 --> 29:03.790
I must admit, I have noticed
an increased amount of strength.

29:04.590 --> 29:06.470
Maybe Ford is right.

29:06.510 --> 29:09.270
Maybe it's worth looking into seeing
what this stuff can do.

29:09.830 --> 29:14.830
They were an hour late in delivering
our doses yesterday and I felt awful.

29:14.870 --> 29:19.550
It frightens me how reliant my body has become
on the enzyme always being in my system.

29:19.590 --> 29:22.190
What would happen if we
suddenly could not receive it?

29:22.230 --> 29:24.830
The only negative is that
you gotta keep taking it.

29:25.110 --> 29:26.790
I'd wanna stay on it.

29:26.830 --> 29:28.310
How about you?

29:29.150 --> 29:31.990
The fact that I'm even
considering it, makes me feel...

29:34.470 --> 29:35.510
So?

29:36.830 --> 29:38.350
It's ready.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.770
OK, now... Could you move?

29:47.810 --> 29:50.650
Look, this is probably gonna
make you a little uneasy, but

29:50.690 --> 29:53.010
when the canopy forms, it's perfectly opaque.

29:53.050 --> 29:55.130
Then, how am I gonna fly this thing?

29:55.170 --> 29:58.450
The whole thing is one giant heads up display. It'll
show you all the pertinent information that you need.

29:58.570 --> 29:59.410
Yeah, you mean in Wraith!

29:59.450 --> 30:02.890
Which is why I've installed an interface
to translate a lot of the readouts.

30:02.930 --> 30:05.530
And by a lot, you mean all? Because
my Wraith's not all that good.

30:05.570 --> 30:06.490
Enough to get you by.

30:06.530 --> 30:07.690
I knew you could do it.

30:07.730 --> 30:09.210
<i>Right on time.</i>

30:09.250 --> 30:11.850
Kanayo's gonna get you suited up.
You should get ready.

30:11.890 --> 30:12.650
Right.

30:22.130 --> 30:23.770
Seems a little nervous.

30:24.890 --> 30:26.650
You know McKay. He'll be fine.

30:26.690 --> 30:28.410
You know how to dial the DHD on this thing?

30:28.450 --> 30:29.650
The address is memorised.

30:29.690 --> 30:31.690
Good.

30:33.090 --> 30:34.970
<i>Listen, I should probably tell you,</i>

30:35.010 --> 30:37.130
there's been a slight change of plans.

30:37.370 --> 30:38.570
Oh yeah?

30:38.730 --> 30:39.890
Kanayo!

30:41.810 --> 30:44.050
<i>Don't even think about it!</i>

30:49.910 --> 30:51.630
What the hell you doing?

30:51.670 --> 30:53.910
McKay's going to stay here,
while we do the op.

30:53.950 --> 30:54.910
Take him!

30:56.590 --> 30:58.550
This wasn't part of the plan.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.390
Neither was you heading back to Atlantis.

31:01.350 --> 31:05.870
You didn't really buy the whole
'I wanna go home' speech, did you?

31:13.910 --> 31:16.470
<i>Always underestimating me Sheppard.
You need to stop doing that.</i>

31:16.510 --> 31:18.630
Complete the mission and McKay lives.

31:18.670 --> 31:21.630
We can't complete the mission, Ford.
It's a bad plan!

31:21.950 --> 31:23.230
You said it was a great plan.

31:23.270 --> 31:25.950
You didn't buy the whole
'It's a great plan' speech, did you?

31:27.190 --> 31:29.550
Get this Dart in the air and come scoop us up.

31:33.150 --> 31:36.590
And the Dart DHD only dials to the
planet we're going to and back here.

31:36.630 --> 31:39.470
Just in case McKay's life isn't enough
to get you to do the right thing.

31:40.830 --> 31:43.790
Aiden.
What are you doing?

31:43.830 --> 31:46.310
Just making sure you guys
hold up your end of the bargain.

31:47.950 --> 31:49.750
It's OK, give them back their weapons.

31:50.310 --> 31:52.070
Are you sure?

31:52.110 --> 31:55.350
Yeah. If we're gonna do this,
we all gotta work together.

32:08.270 --> 32:09.910
Good luck to us all.

32:17.390 --> 32:19.670
Stand by for pick-up

32:38.270 --> 32:40.430
If they were OK, they would have radioed in by now.

32:40.470 --> 32:42.150
I understand that, ma'am.

32:43.470 --> 32:47.750
I want everyone who is cleared for offworld
activity, to help with the search.

32:47.790 --> 32:51.870
The Daedalus is on its way from Earth and they'll be
able to help, but until they get here, it's up to us.

32:51.910 --> 32:58.350
And I know that, but I need you to understand
that it is gonna take a very long time to
search all the planets on our list.

32:58.390 --> 33:00.750
It could take months.

33:00.790 --> 33:03.710
We can't afford months. Major.

33:03.750 --> 33:05.950
And I know that, too.

33:06.590 --> 33:08.270
Good.

33:24.190 --> 33:26.590
This is gonna take some getting used to.

33:32.750 --> 33:36.750
Come on! And we were getting along so well.

33:38.310 --> 33:40.430
Auto Pilot. NO!

33:41.310 --> 33:43.110
R2, I need you to turn
the auto pilot off!

33:47.870 --> 33:48.790
Now!

33:53.350 --> 33:54.950
Worth a try.

34:30.230 --> 34:31.429
Jace!

34:35.550 --> 34:36.870
We have to go after them!

34:36.909 --> 34:38.670
No-one would have survived that fall.

34:39.670 --> 34:41.670
We have to get out of the open.

34:45.830 --> 34:47.150
You guys OK?

34:47.190 --> 34:49.389
<i>No, we're not OK!</i>

34:49.429 --> 34:51.870
You beamed half
of us off the edge of the platform.

34:52.429 --> 34:53.949
Teyla and Ronon?

34:53.989 --> 34:55.830
Is that all you care about?
You murdered my men!

34:55.870 --> 34:59.030
I've lost all control of the Dart.
I had to release you blind.

34:59.070 --> 35:01.510
Maintain radio silence until we lay the charge.

35:01.550 --> 35:03.030
Negative! We need to stay in contact.

35:03.070 --> 35:03.870
<i>Their ship...</i>

35:03.910 --> 35:05.790
You should leave that radio on, Aiden.

35:05.830 --> 35:06.990
Don't tell me what to do.

35:17.230 --> 35:18.030
Ford.

35:19.150 --> 35:19.950
Ford?

35:20.350 --> 35:21.150
Ford!

35:21.550 --> 35:21.990
Damnit!

35:24.550 --> 35:26.310
I'd prefer not to.

35:29.190 --> 35:30.750
Oh boy!

35:34.950 --> 35:36.350
Would you mind checking tomorrow?

35:40.910 --> 35:42.390
This is not good.

35:46.190 --> 35:47.430
What is that?

35:47.710 --> 35:48.750
It's an alarm.

35:49.310 --> 35:50.270
That shouldn't happen.

35:50.310 --> 35:51.270
No it shouldn't.

35:53.030 --> 35:54.070
Sheppard, you there?

35:56.510 --> 35:57.950
<i>Sheppard, you there?</i>

35:57.990 --> 35:59.590
I think I might have set the alarm off.

35:59.630 --> 36:02.030
You guys be careful,
cos there's probably some guards on the way.

36:03.070 --> 36:04.230
Too late.

36:04.910 --> 36:06.990
If you wanna live, stay behind me.

36:16.150 --> 36:17.230
You want some?

36:17.270 --> 36:18.510
No, I'm good, thanks.

36:18.550 --> 36:19.590
- You sure?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

36:19.630 --> 36:21.590
Look, don't you
think that they should be back by now?

36:21.630 --> 36:23.670
I mean, how long does it take to
fly there and fly back, you know? I mean

36:23.710 --> 36:26.830
I say it's a minute from here to the gate.

36:26.870 --> 36:29.270
Ten, tops from their gate to the hive ship.

36:29.310 --> 36:34.190
Twenty to get in and lay a charge and and what,
ten more to get back out and home, right? So...

36:34.230 --> 36:35.550
Worrying really isn't going to do anything.

36:35.590 --> 36:36.910
Yeah well, I subscribe to a
different school of thought.

36:36.950 --> 36:39.750
- They're fine!
- You can't possibly know that!

36:41.790 --> 36:44.910
- I got a gut feeling.
- Yeah, well I have a different gut...

36:49.550 --> 36:50.350
feeling.

36:53.630 --> 36:54.430
Ford!

36:54.710 --> 36:55.750
<i>What's your position?</i>

36:57.790 --> 36:58.790
Ford!

37:16.150 --> 37:17.230
Ah, dammit!

37:43.590 --> 37:44.990
Keep fighting!

38:06.350 --> 38:10.750
And thanks to several modifications,
the specifics of which are encrypted in this databurst,

38:10.790 --> 38:16.070
we believe we can streamline
our power consumption a further 30%.

38:21.470 --> 38:23.470
Also at the time of this transmission,

38:23.510 --> 38:26.190
Colonel Sheppard's team is still missing and is

38:27.230 --> 38:28.190
is presumed...

38:29.710 --> 38:33.190
Colonel Sheppard's team is still missing.
End transmission.

38:40.350 --> 38:41.390
Are you alright?

38:42.550 --> 38:44.150
I'm in a holding cell?

38:44.230 --> 38:45.750
Yes.

38:45.790 --> 38:47.950
On a hive ship.

38:49.390 --> 38:51.950
Well then, no, I'm not doing so good!

38:52.510 --> 38:53.950
I can't believe you screwed up!

38:53.990 --> 38:55.670
I did what?

38:56.270 --> 38:58.150
You set off the alarm.
You ruined the mission.

38:58.190 --> 39:01.870
The Dart went on auto-pilot,
the second I got close to the hive.

39:01.910 --> 39:03.990
You're lucky I was able to get you out!

39:04.030 --> 39:05.310
Why would it do that?

39:05.350 --> 39:06.910
Why would it go on auto-pilot?

39:06.950 --> 39:09.310
That's what Jumpers do
when they gate to Atlantis.

39:09.350 --> 39:10.950
Well, why didn't you say something?

39:10.990 --> 39:12.670
Why didn't I say something?

39:13.750 --> 39:14.950
You want me to fail.

39:15.470 --> 39:18.310
<i>- You want me to look bad.
- That's right, you snot nosed brat!</i>

39:18.350 --> 39:21.710
I put my team's life on the line,
just to prove you wrong!

39:22.630 --> 39:24.230
We got company.

39:33.270 --> 39:35.750
Move away.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.750
What do you want?

39:39.470 --> 39:42.510
The one who flew the ship.

39:44.110 --> 39:45.830
Why don't you start with me?

39:48.670 --> 39:49.950
<i>Wait!</i>

39:50.830 --> 39:52.070
You want me.

40:09.870 --> 40:11.070
It's alright.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.150
There's always a way out.

40:13.670 --> 40:15.070
If he dies,

40:15.670 --> 40:16.750
you die.
