WEBVTT

00:00.487 --> 00:02.154
Previously on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.329 --> 00:03.904
Final six, baby!

00:04.230 --> 00:05.063
The final six Chefs...

00:07.199 --> 00:09.534
Faced off in their first
individual challenge.

00:09.602 --> 00:12.870
Each of you will
create a unique amuse.

00:12.938 --> 00:15.506
Chef Ramsay invited five
master Chefs to judge.

00:15.573 --> 00:17.775
This was a rare treat for me.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.912
Trev's frogs' legs earned him
the lowest score.

00:19.979 --> 00:21.348
It looks like maybe you put
the frog in the blender.

00:21.416 --> 00:24.251
62 out of 100.

00:24.319 --> 00:26.120
While Russell...
I loved it.

00:26.188 --> 00:27.121
Received a perfect score.

00:27.189 --> 00:28.589
Russell, very, very impressive.

00:28.658 --> 00:29.591
<i>A perfect 100.</i>

00:31.229 --> 00:32.963
But at dinner service,

00:33.031 --> 00:34.767
everyone performed like a zero.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.202
<i>Russell, they're undercooked.</i>

00:36.269 --> 00:38.771
Get your eyes tested.

00:38.838 --> 00:40.606
Trev continued to fall apart.

00:40.675 --> 00:42.909
There's pasta in the bag!

00:42.977 --> 00:44.411
Stop yelling!

00:44.479 --> 00:46.747
Get your together
and cook the pasta!

00:46.814 --> 00:48.582
Sabrina couldn't
get appetizers out.

00:48.650 --> 00:50.150
Truffle salads!
It's not normal!

00:51.552 --> 00:53.787
How in the hell does
a salad come back?

00:53.855 --> 00:57.090
You ignorant bitch,
what's wrong with you?

00:57.158 --> 00:58.859
And Gail failed on fish.

00:58.927 --> 01:01.129
That's what I got given
at the pass!

01:01.197 --> 01:02.598
This far into the game,
we should be able

01:02.666 --> 01:03.399
to run a kitchen.

01:03.466 --> 01:05.168
For God's sake!

01:05.236 --> 01:07.071
Chef Ramsay was left
with no choice.

01:07.139 --> 01:09.608
I cannot do this anymore!

01:09.676 --> 01:12.077
Get out! Get out!
Get out!

01:12.144 --> 01:15.313
The final six had to nominate
two for elimination.

01:15.381 --> 01:17.016
Jillian was gunning for Gail.

01:17.083 --> 01:18.484
I don't feel like you
communicated

01:18.552 --> 01:19.886
with me at all tonight.

01:19.954 --> 01:21.989
Gail sucks in the kitchen.

01:22.057 --> 01:24.959
But the group decided
on Trev and Sabrina.

01:25.027 --> 01:27.028
Sabrina had an unusual defense.

01:27.096 --> 01:29.165
I think Trevor should stay,
I should stay,

01:29.232 --> 01:32.101
and I think Gail should leave.

01:32.169 --> 01:34.337
But Chef Ramsay
had his mind made up.

01:34.405 --> 01:36.607
Sabrina, give me your jacket.

01:36.675 --> 01:38.409
Putting an end to the dream
of the overachieving

01:38.477 --> 01:42.782
22-year-old from San Diego.

And now the continuation
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

02:47.553 --> 02:49.955
Sabrina threw me under the bus.

02:50.022 --> 02:52.257
I would never do that
to anyone.

02:52.325 --> 02:53.925
Sabrina really
me over.

02:53.993 --> 02:58.330
Ink Gail should leave.

02:58.397 --> 03:00.765
What?

03:00.833 --> 03:02.267
She's an executive Chef
and she can't get through

03:02.335 --> 03:04.669
the fish station.

03:04.737 --> 03:06.371
Now I really have to show
Chef Ramsay that I still

03:06.439 --> 03:07.806
have a lot of fight in me.

03:07.873 --> 03:09.407
We're in his sights now.

03:09.475 --> 03:11.476
<i>Everybody else</i>
<i>is getting ignored.</i>

03:11.544 --> 03:13.411
There's no room
for error at all.

03:13.479 --> 03:15.447
This is serious business.

03:15.514 --> 03:16.715
The fun and games is over.

03:16.783 --> 03:18.283
Well, there went our free pass.

03:18.351 --> 03:20.687
It's really hard
to hear Chef Ramsay say

03:20.754 --> 03:21.888
that he's disappointed.

03:21.956 --> 03:24.090
You do everything you can

03:24.158 --> 03:25.559
and it's not enough.

03:25.626 --> 03:27.361
It's never enough
for Chef Ramsay.

03:27.429 --> 03:32.366
We're here because
he sees something in us.

03:32.434 --> 03:34.903
Gail
On me bad tonight.

03:34.970 --> 03:36.404
And she knows that if there
was a third person,

03:36.472 --> 03:37.738
she would have gone up.

03:37.806 --> 03:38.973
She just needs to get her
together.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.707
She's gonna be
the next one to go.

03:40.775 --> 03:43.910
I don't feel like she's able
to handle the pressure.

03:43.977 --> 03:46.412
I don't feel like she's able
to communicate

03:46.480 --> 03:48.080
and I think she needs
to go back to being

03:48.148 --> 03:49.848
a desk executive Chef.

03:49.916 --> 03:52.484
If that happens again,
she's gone.

03:52.552 --> 03:54.252
Gail dodged a bullet tonight.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.420
You know, she hasn't
cleared a hurdle yet.

03:55.487 --> 03:56.654
She's got a lot to prove.

03:56.722 --> 03:57.655
If the fire's not lit now,

03:57.723 --> 03:59.190
it's not gonna get lit.

03:59.258 --> 04:00.625
Well, I mean,
it's pretty obvious

04:00.693 --> 04:02.327
who's gonna probably
go home next.

04:02.395 --> 04:05.397
Homeboy's gonna go home,
whether he likes it or not.

04:05.465 --> 04:07.433
Trevor will probably be next.

04:07.501 --> 04:09.302
I don't think he has a chance.
This ain't a joke.

04:09.370 --> 04:10.670
This is real-deal Holyfield
right here.

04:10.738 --> 04:12.205
He's not even a Chef.
He's a bartender.

04:16.178 --> 04:18.245
That's what I'm thinking, dude.

04:18.313 --> 04:19.846
Gonna be crazy, ladies.

04:19.914 --> 04:21.048
I've been telling Nona
that since day one.

04:21.116 --> 04:22.583
Mm-hmm.
It's coming.

04:22.650 --> 04:24.351
Very close.
Yeah.

04:24.419 --> 04:26.820
While three of the five
finalists

04:26.888 --> 04:27.955
are feeling pretty safe...

04:29.657 --> 04:30.957
<i>Let's go!</i>
<i>We got to run!</i>

04:31.025 --> 04:32.392
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

04:32.459 --> 04:33.593
Chef Ramsay is not exactly ready

04:33.661 --> 04:34.827
to pick a winner.

04:34.894 --> 04:36.495
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>

04:36.563 --> 04:38.230
Today's challenge
has been designed

04:38.298 --> 04:39.531
to test another
important quality

04:39.599 --> 04:41.066
of being head Chef
at the prize restaurant.

04:41.134 --> 04:42.301
Good morning.
Morning, Chef.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.536
<i>That L.A. Market thing</i>
<i>downtown,</i>

04:43.603 --> 04:44.403
<i>there's no question you have</i>

04:44.471 --> 04:45.905
a completely different clientele

04:45.973 --> 04:47.841
<i>for dinner service</i>
<i>than you do for lunch.</i>

04:47.908 --> 04:49.242
High-powered lawyers, agents,

04:49.310 --> 04:51.111
they're gonna be in and out,

04:51.179 --> 04:54.014
which brings me to our next
individual challenge.

04:54.082 --> 04:56.818
Today, each of you will serve
a single lunch.

04:56.885 --> 04:59.353
Something that can satisfy
that clientele.

04:59.421 --> 05:01.021
I'm really stoked
for L.A. Market

05:01.088 --> 05:02.655
and I'm ready to go.

05:02.723 --> 05:04.557
Jump in the car.
I'll meet you there.

05:04.625 --> 05:07.259
I'm ready to get gangster
on these bitches.

05:10.129 --> 05:12.864
Going downtown to cook
in L.A. Market,

05:12.932 --> 05:15.066
it's just a little taste
of what could be to come

05:15.134 --> 05:16.534
if I win <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

05:16.602 --> 05:18.002
Let's go, guys.

05:18.069 --> 05:20.938
There's your kitchens!

05:23.675 --> 05:25.208
Oh, my God, dude.

05:25.276 --> 05:26.376
What?
Oh, come on.

05:26.444 --> 05:28.077
<i>Did you honestly</i>
<i>think</i>

05:28.145 --> 05:29.279
<i>you'll be cooking</i>
<i>at L.A. Market?</i>

05:29.346 --> 05:30.847
Are you kidding me?

05:30.915 --> 05:32.983
Like, catering truck?

05:33.050 --> 05:34.884
<i>These are the most amazing,</i>

05:34.952 --> 05:37.320
<i>state of the art</i>
<i>food trucks, yes?</i>

05:37.388 --> 05:40.089
Awesome.
Awesome!

05:40.157 --> 05:41.824
You got everything you could
possibly want inside them

05:41.892 --> 05:43.225
to produce this exquisite lunch.

05:43.293 --> 05:44.860
Yes, Chef.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.929
This is, like, carnie style.

05:46.997 --> 05:49.231
Throw me into a box
with a griddle.

05:49.299 --> 05:50.800
How am I gonna do this?

05:50.867 --> 05:53.135
Now we have spread
the word

05:53.203 --> 05:56.572
that you guys are cooking
this exquisite lunch.

05:56.639 --> 05:58.140
Will be expecting
five different samples.

05:58.207 --> 05:59.941
Obviously, one from each of you.

06:00.009 --> 06:01.376
The most popular dish
will win the challenge.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.045
Yes, Chef.

06:03.112 --> 06:04.880
<i>And here's the bad news:</i>
<i>You only have one hour</i>

06:04.947 --> 06:05.847
to get ready.
Yes, Chef.

06:05.915 --> 06:07.549
Get going.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.551
In today's food truck
challenge...

06:09.619 --> 06:10.986
<i>Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.</i>

06:11.054 --> 06:12.287
Each Chef will have one hour

06:12.355 --> 06:14.422
to prepare 80 portions
of their signature lunch.

06:14.490 --> 06:15.824
Check all your ingredients,
make sure everything's on, yes?

06:15.892 --> 06:17.292
Yes, Chef.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.427
The Chefs have a wide array

06:19.495 --> 06:20.862
of ingredients to choose from
in preparing their dish.

06:20.930 --> 06:22.464
Sweet.

06:22.532 --> 06:24.232
Nona will be serving
a chicken salad

06:24.300 --> 06:25.700
and bacon sandwich
on a croissant

06:25.768 --> 06:27.279
with sweet potato chips.

06:27.379 --> 06:29.301
I don't even know what any
of this equipment is?

06:29.943 --> 06:31.362
Where the hell is the oven?

06:31.574 --> 06:32.974
Okay, Jillian, let's go.

06:33.042 --> 06:34.642
Yes, Chef.

06:34.710 --> 06:35.844
Jillian is preparing
herb chicken

06:35.912 --> 06:36.844
with mixed vegetables.

06:36.912 --> 06:37.845
Perfect.

06:37.913 --> 06:39.447
Come on, baby, cook.

06:39.514 --> 06:41.449
Trev, 30 minutes to go.
Let's go.

06:41.517 --> 06:42.850
You got it.

06:42.918 --> 06:44.819
Trev's dish is penne pasta

06:44.886 --> 06:46.820
with grilled Italian sausage
and tomato sauce.

06:46.888 --> 06:48.289
Whoo!
That's good stuff.

06:48.356 --> 06:49.756
I'm feeling great.

06:49.824 --> 06:51.058
I'm feeling ready
to rock and roll.

06:51.125 --> 06:52.459
Oh, it smells good in here.

06:52.527 --> 06:54.327
Seriously, we're at this point
in the competition.

06:54.395 --> 06:56.029
'Em all.
I want to win.

06:56.097 --> 06:58.465
Beautiful!

06:58.532 --> 06:59.833
Yes, sir.

06:59.901 --> 07:01.669
Russell's signature lunch

07:01.736 --> 07:05.173
is a grilled octopus
and saffron aioli salad.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.409
These are beautiful octopus.
I'm gonna be killing it.

07:07.476 --> 07:09.478
I have enough experience
serving lunch

07:09.545 --> 07:10.546
to gauge what people like
and what they don't like.

07:10.613 --> 07:11.948
I'm good.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.349
I'm not gonna serve linguine
and meatballs.

07:13.417 --> 07:14.217
That's not my style.

07:14.284 --> 07:15.585
Got to keep it gangster.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.587
Let's go, Russell.
Yes, Chef!

07:17.654 --> 07:19.288
With time running out...

07:19.356 --> 07:20.222
<i>Okay, Gail?</i>

07:20.290 --> 07:21.123
Yes, Chef?
Last five.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.524
<i>Let's go.</i>

07:22.592 --> 07:24.293
Gail scrambles to finish her

07:24.361 --> 07:24.994
grilled skirt steak salad
with mangoes

07:25.062 --> 07:29.231
and candy pecans.

07:29.299 --> 07:31.200
After last night's
dinner service,

07:31.268 --> 07:32.501
I'm really striving to win
on individual challenges

07:32.569 --> 07:34.102
so I can prove my worth.

07:34.170 --> 07:35.403
Start getting a plating up.
Let's go.

07:35.471 --> 07:37.939
Come on, beer.

07:38.007 --> 07:39.308
I can't this up.
It's a salad.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.242
It's a salad.

07:40.310 --> 07:41.777
One minute to go, guys!

07:41.845 --> 07:43.345
Last minute!
<i>Last minute! Let's go!</i>

07:43.413 --> 07:44.947
Took way too much
time here.

07:45.015 --> 07:46.282
<i>Let's go, Russell!</i>

07:46.350 --> 07:48.852
<i>30 seconds to go.</i>

07:48.919 --> 07:50.520
15 seconds to go, Nona!

07:50.588 --> 07:51.855
Kick ass, man.

07:51.923 --> 07:53.023
These customers wait
for nobody.

07:53.091 --> 07:55.659
Here they come.

07:55.727 --> 07:58.862
Oh, my God.

07:58.930 --> 08:01.164
All of a sudden, like,
all these people started coming

08:01.232 --> 08:02.332
and I'm like, "oh, ."

08:02.400 --> 08:05.535
Five, four, three--

08:05.603 --> 08:07.437
<i>Gail, let's go.</i>
Yes, Chef.

08:07.505 --> 08:09.672
<i>One, and serve, guys!</i>

08:09.740 --> 08:11.708
The 80 downtown professionals

08:11.775 --> 08:14.043
will sample each of
the signature lunch dishes

08:14.111 --> 08:15.378
and choose their favorite.

08:15.445 --> 08:16.879
Thank you.
You're welcome.

08:16.947 --> 08:18.247
How are you doing?
I'm doing good!

08:18.315 --> 08:20.749
And some of the Chefs are using

08:20.817 --> 08:22.618
all of their talents
to sway the voters.

08:22.685 --> 08:24.085
Man, there are so many
good-looking women.

08:25.387 --> 08:26.421
How you doing, sweetheart?

08:26.488 --> 08:27.955
You enjoy that, okay?

08:28.023 --> 08:29.624
Man, I get all the cute girls
today, don't I?

08:29.691 --> 08:31.726
That's a nice top.

08:31.793 --> 08:32.994
You haven't even
seen me wink at you yet.

08:34.996 --> 08:37.798
Chicken salad sandwich.

08:37.866 --> 08:39.667
Thank you.
Hey, I'm a southern girl.

08:39.734 --> 08:41.101
That's how we roll.

08:41.169 --> 08:42.034
This is what we do
in the south.

08:43.538 --> 08:45.005
We make sure everybody's
having a good time.

08:45.073 --> 08:45.940
Man, y'all are just multiplying.

08:46.007 --> 08:47.874
Southern hospitality.

08:47.942 --> 08:49.776
While some of the Chefs are

08:49.844 --> 08:51.611
relying on charm
to sell their lunches...

08:51.679 --> 08:53.078
What's shaking, baby?
There you go.

08:53.146 --> 08:54.680
Thank you.

08:54.748 --> 08:56.048
Russell's dish...

08:56.116 --> 08:57.550
Really?
Octopus, huh?

08:57.617 --> 08:59.085
Is speaking for itself.

08:59.153 --> 09:00.854
It's good to go.
Thank you.

09:00.921 --> 09:03.023
Saw you kind of make a poopy
face when I said, "octopus."

09:03.091 --> 09:04.391
Ugh.

09:04.459 --> 09:05.860
Yeah, everything sounded good,
but that octopus,

09:05.927 --> 09:07.328
I don't know.

09:07.395 --> 09:08.663
I'm going for something
a little different.

09:08.731 --> 09:10.164
It doesn't look too good.

09:10.232 --> 09:11.933
<i>Give it a try.</i>
All right.

09:12.001 --> 09:13.835
Now that all 80 guests

09:13.903 --> 09:15.737
have sampled the lunches,
they've been instructed

09:15.805 --> 09:18.240
to rank the dishes
from best to worst.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.674
Tell me what's been your
favorite so far.

09:19.742 --> 09:20.509
This one.
The pasta.

09:20.576 --> 09:21.910
I really liked the steak.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.379
I loved the octopus.

09:24.447 --> 09:26.381
The chicken sandwich
is very tasty.

09:26.449 --> 09:27.715
Trevor was really
entertaining.

09:27.783 --> 09:29.016
Hey, who wants seconds?

09:31.319 --> 09:33.487
Okay, lunch is over

09:33.554 --> 09:37.857
Thank you, guys.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.492
Okay, I have in my hand

09:39.560 --> 09:42.094
the results of our downtown
power lunch.

09:42.162 --> 09:44.431
I've asked our customers
to vote

09:44.498 --> 09:46.466
for the dishes
they most enjoyed

09:46.534 --> 09:49.235
<i>and for the dishes that they</i>
<i>didn't prefer, yes?</i>

09:49.303 --> 09:50.336
Yes, Chef.

09:50.404 --> 09:52.505
Unfortunately,
61% of you

09:52.573 --> 09:56.910
said that this
was the worst dish.

09:56.978 --> 09:58.678
You did not like
this dish, did you?

09:58.746 --> 10:00.014
No!

10:00.081 --> 10:03.617
And that dish belongs to...

10:03.685 --> 10:04.818
Russell.

10:08.389 --> 10:11.058
I was very confident
in what I did,

10:11.125 --> 10:13.393
and, you know,
I thought I killed it.

10:13.461 --> 10:15.128
It's outside the box,
you know?

10:15.196 --> 10:16.929
You guys want to go
over there and eat

10:16.997 --> 10:17.697
some spaghetti and meatballs?
Go ahead.

10:17.764 --> 10:18.497
That's not my shtick.

10:18.565 --> 10:20.299
Right, ladies and gentlemen.

10:20.367 --> 10:24.070
<i>With a staggering 40% of you</i>
<i>preferring this dish...</i>

10:24.137 --> 10:27.940
The winning dish belongs to...

10:28.008 --> 10:29.008
<i>Wow.</i>

10:29.076 --> 10:31.977
Unbelievable.

10:37.134 --> 10:38.868
In today's food truck
challenge...

10:38.936 --> 10:40.836
I have in my hand the results.

10:40.904 --> 10:42.437
The final five Chefs
battled it out

10:42.505 --> 10:44.406
to prove who's dish
was most appealing

10:44.474 --> 10:46.409
to the downtown Los Angeles
lunch crowd.

10:46.477 --> 10:49.745
The worst dish belongs
to Russell.

10:49.813 --> 10:55.285
And your favorite dish
belongs to...

10:55.353 --> 10:56.553
Gail.
Well done!

10:57.655 --> 10:59.256
<i>Very good.</i>

10:59.324 --> 11:01.225
Yes! I won!

11:01.293 --> 11:04.329
Take that.

11:04.396 --> 11:05.697
Thanks, guys!

11:05.765 --> 11:08.065
<i>Really well done.</i>

11:08.133 --> 11:09.600
Only 2% behind was Nona.

11:09.668 --> 11:11.469
On!

11:11.536 --> 11:12.936
I was so close.

11:13.004 --> 11:15.706
I was literally that close.

11:17.475 --> 11:18.975
What the ?

11:19.043 --> 11:21.244
I lost to sweet potato chips and
a damn salad?

11:21.312 --> 11:23.447
Seriously?

11:23.514 --> 11:24.881
Well done, my darling.
Thank you.

11:24.949 --> 11:26.616
<i>You have a very special day.</i>

11:26.684 --> 11:27.683
You're heading off
to Beverly Hills...

11:29.019 --> 11:30.587
Where you're gonna
get the most amazing makeover

11:30.654 --> 11:33.122
by the famed hairdresser
to the stars

11:33.190 --> 11:34.724
Jose Eber.

11:34.792 --> 11:35.925
<i>Huh?</i>

11:35.993 --> 11:39.062
<i>How cool is that?</i>

11:39.130 --> 11:40.230
That sucks.

11:40.297 --> 11:41.531
Why did Gail have to win?

11:43.100 --> 11:45.768
After, you'll be heading
back to Hollywood

11:45.836 --> 11:48.904
where the most amazing
celebrity fashion critic

11:48.972 --> 11:51.474
Steven Cojocaru, "Cojo,"

11:51.541 --> 11:54.543
will be styling you for a new
look from top to bottom.

11:54.611 --> 11:56.745
<i>Amazing, amazing, amazing.</i>

11:56.813 --> 11:58.513
That's great, Gail,
'cause you're the one

11:58.582 --> 12:00.049
that needs the makeover
the most.

12:00.116 --> 12:01.817
Sadly, for the rest of you,

12:01.885 --> 12:03.052
<i>you'll be heading back</i>
<i>to Hell's Kitchen</i>

12:03.120 --> 12:04.954
<i>where we need to fix up</i>

12:05.022 --> 12:06.990
the outside ahead of tomorrow
night's service.

12:08.959 --> 12:11.928
I am just about done cleaning
Hell's Kitchen.

12:11.995 --> 12:14.831
I am really over
the cleaning.

12:14.898 --> 12:16.266
Thank you once again.

12:16.333 --> 12:17.700
Thank y'all.
Thank you so much.

12:17.768 --> 12:18.735
<i>Excellent.</i>

12:18.803 --> 12:24.341
Let's go, guys.
Let's go.

12:24.408 --> 12:25.642
Home sweet home.

12:25.710 --> 12:26.910
Whoopee.

12:26.977 --> 12:28.378
I won the challenge.

12:28.445 --> 12:29.579
Yay, me.

12:29.647 --> 12:32.115
Seriously,
I had so much fun today

12:32.183 --> 12:34.017
<i>serving lunch</i>
<i>for all those people.</i>

12:34.084 --> 12:35.485
<i>Whatever.</i>

12:35.553 --> 12:37.220
It's just a great feeling
to have won.

12:37.288 --> 12:38.555
Everything that I'm doing,
all that hard work,

12:38.623 --> 12:40.123
it's all coming together.

12:40.191 --> 12:41.024
<i>Good job, Gail.</i>

12:41.092 --> 12:41.891
<i>Thanks.</i>

12:41.959 --> 12:43.392
I do feel bad that the rest

12:43.460 --> 12:45.127
of the team has to clean up
that Hell's Kitchen,

12:45.195 --> 12:46.495
but I can't wait
for my makeover.

12:46.563 --> 12:48.197
I'm so excited.

12:48.265 --> 12:49.898
<i>Bye.</i>
<i>Have a good time.</i>

12:49.966 --> 12:52.401
Have fun
<i>Congratulations.</i>

12:52.469 --> 12:54.603
<i>Bye.</i>

12:54.671 --> 12:56.805
God, 2%.

12:56.873 --> 12:57.973
<i>That's, like, one person.</i>

12:58.041 --> 12:59.074
I'm pissed.

12:59.142 --> 13:00.942
I get beat out
by a salad!

13:01.010 --> 13:02.177
"I want a salad."

13:02.244 --> 13:04.445
Eat some pasta, you mothers.

13:04.513 --> 13:06.180
I'm sick of losing.

13:06.248 --> 13:09.750
I cook good food, and
it's not being appreciated.

13:09.817 --> 13:11.184
Californians.

13:11.252 --> 13:13.153
<i>If we were downtown Chicago,</i>

13:13.221 --> 13:16.655
dude, pasta and Italian sausage
with a fresh sauce right there.

13:16.723 --> 13:18.490
<i>Hands down, baby.</i>

13:18.558 --> 13:19.524
Hands down.

13:19.592 --> 13:20.759
I don't really care if we were

13:20.826 --> 13:21.693
<i>in Venezuela or Egypt.</i>

13:21.760 --> 13:23.094
<i>It don't matter.</i>

13:23.162 --> 13:24.162
We all knew we were
in California

13:24.229 --> 13:24.896
for this challenge, right?

13:24.963 --> 13:26.564
Yep.

13:26.632 --> 13:28.566
Russell's Mr. fancypants,
so when he made octopus,

13:28.634 --> 13:30.602
it didn't shock me,
but it was nice

13:30.670 --> 13:32.838
to see him come in dead last
though, that's for sure.

13:36.242 --> 13:40.847
Wow.

13:40.914 --> 13:42.415
I'm Gail.
I'm Jose.

13:42.483 --> 13:43.716
Nice to meet you, Jose.

13:43.784 --> 13:45.385
I've totally heard of Jose Eber.

13:45.453 --> 13:47.086
Like, he does all
the celebrities,

13:47.154 --> 13:48.421
everyone's hair,
and he's just fantastic.

13:48.488 --> 13:49.789
We're gonna transform you.

13:49.857 --> 13:53.259
I'm really, really excited.

13:55.595 --> 13:56.661
<i>It needs to be, like, "wow."</i>

13:56.729 --> 13:57.962
Va-va-voom.

13:58.030 --> 13:59.530
I'm getting fabulous hair,

13:59.598 --> 14:01.366
make-up,
fabulous manicure.

14:01.433 --> 14:02.500
This is fabulous.

14:02.568 --> 14:04.669
Gosh, I could do this every day.

14:04.736 --> 14:05.770
Are you a single woman?

14:05.837 --> 14:07.238
Yes, I am.

14:07.306 --> 14:08.439
You are single
for not much longer.

14:10.643 --> 14:14.245
Okay, Gail, you ready
for the new you?

14:14.313 --> 14:15.513
Ah!

14:17.316 --> 14:18.884
With the hair styling
now completed...

14:18.952 --> 14:20.752
Feels sexy?
I love it.

14:20.820 --> 14:22.621
Gail heads off to get
a new wardrobe.

14:22.689 --> 14:23.956
<i>James.</i>

14:24.024 --> 14:25.491
Meanwhile, the losers

14:25.559 --> 14:26.292
are getting a new outfit
as well.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.293
New jackets.

14:27.361 --> 14:29.528
I freaking hate cleaning.

14:29.596 --> 14:31.596
I need you to sweep
these staircases.

14:31.664 --> 14:32.998
<i>Sweep the whole</i>
<i>of the driveway.</i>

14:33.065 --> 14:34.165
<i>We've got paint down here.</i>

14:34.233 --> 14:35.833
You've got to touch up these
spots over here.

14:35.901 --> 14:37.902
This sucks.

14:37.969 --> 14:42.172
Okay, guys, let's get started.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.241
<i>Trevor, make sure you get the</i>
<i>stainless steel on the doors.</i>

14:44.309 --> 14:46.175
Kidding me, right?

14:46.243 --> 14:47.810
You'd better get really busy.

14:47.878 --> 14:49.445
Don't give a
What he says.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.347
I don't think you really want
to run your mouth yet, do you?

14:51.415 --> 14:53.883
At least I come in second
from last and not last.

14:53.950 --> 14:55.217
You still lost.

14:55.285 --> 14:56.519
<i>How about not serving</i>

14:56.587 --> 15:00.055
octopus off a catering truck?

15:00.123 --> 15:01.925
Blah, blah, blah.
Whatever.

15:01.992 --> 15:04.560
Jillian's as creative as that
wooden box right there.

15:04.628 --> 15:06.862
I'd rather serve
my food and lose

15:06.930 --> 15:09.031
than serve food that doesn't
represent me.

15:09.099 --> 15:11.333
I got this far in this
competition by being myself

15:11.401 --> 15:12.968
and I'm not changing
now.

15:13.036 --> 15:14.803
Hey, guys,
Chef Ramsay inspected

15:14.871 --> 15:16.805
the food trucks from
the challenge this morning

15:16.873 --> 15:18.908
and he's decided
that they need cleaning.

15:22.045 --> 15:23.646
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?

15:25.049 --> 15:26.482
<i>Oh, look who's here.</i>

15:26.550 --> 15:27.717
<i>Gail!</i>

15:27.785 --> 15:28.785
<i>Spray her.</i>

15:33.724 --> 15:35.224
<i>Hi.</i>
Hi, Gail.

15:35.292 --> 15:36.593
<i>How are you?</i>
Come over here.

15:36.660 --> 15:38.161
<i>It's really nice meeting you.</i>

15:38.229 --> 15:39.763
We have to do
the Hollywood hair kiss.

15:39.831 --> 15:41.064
I want to turn you
into a glamour queen.

15:41.132 --> 15:42.232
Okay.

15:42.300 --> 15:45.836
Cojo is, like, amazing.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.305
So do you like color?
I do.

15:47.372 --> 15:49.139
I think you should try this on.

15:49.207 --> 15:51.075
He's the stylist of the stars,
and he's so energetic.

15:51.142 --> 15:52.776
I'm so excited,
I'm jumping out of my skin.

15:52.844 --> 15:53.910
Me too. Me too.
I love that.

15:53.978 --> 15:55.011
Isn't this fun?

15:55.079 --> 15:56.012
<i>And this is hot.</i>

15:56.079 --> 15:57.480
So we're giving you fire!

15:57.548 --> 15:58.847
Hot!

15:58.915 --> 16:01.383
We're in hell.
We like fire.

16:01.451 --> 16:05.686
I'm feeling this.
I'm starting to get excited.

16:05.754 --> 16:07.321
Open the jacket.

16:07.389 --> 16:09.056
You are a star.

16:09.124 --> 16:11.726
No one else can get this, like,
royal treatment anywhere else.

16:11.794 --> 16:13.328
Voila!

16:13.395 --> 16:14.729
Oh!

16:14.797 --> 16:16.397
I'm having a fashion seizure.

16:16.465 --> 16:17.532
You should be.
Smoking!

16:17.600 --> 16:18.633
Oh, I look good.

16:18.701 --> 16:20.135
I love it, love it, love it.

16:20.202 --> 16:21.336
It just hugs
where it needs to hug

16:21.404 --> 16:22.470
and it accentuates my boobs.

16:22.538 --> 16:24.339
Channel that inner diva.

16:24.407 --> 16:26.141
Inside the kitchen,
I'm a terror.

16:26.209 --> 16:28.510
Outside, I'm a terror now too,
so watch out.

16:28.578 --> 16:30.545
While cojo toasts to Gail's new
attention-getting look...

16:30.613 --> 16:31.647
Cheers.
Cheers.

16:31.714 --> 16:33.248
Congratulations.

16:33.315 --> 16:34.882
Back at Hell's Kitchen...

16:34.950 --> 16:36.617
Trevor, can we get
some more water?

16:36.685 --> 16:39.619
The Chefs are trying
to get Trev's attention.

16:39.687 --> 16:41.154
Dude, Trev!

16:41.222 --> 16:44.024
We're all, like trying
to get his stupid stuff done

16:44.092 --> 16:47.660
and Trev's just like...

16:47.728 --> 16:50.430
Come on.
You're taking too long.

16:50.497 --> 16:52.298
We're all in black jackets,

16:52.366 --> 16:54.434
so just knock it off and
go yell at somebody else.

16:54.501 --> 16:56.502
<i>Ha-ha!</i>
<i>I made Jillian wet.</i>

16:56.570 --> 16:58.103
<i>We're done.</i>

16:58.171 --> 16:58.837
<i>All right, come on then.</i>

16:58.905 --> 17:00.038
Head back to the dorms.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.973
Afternoon, good evening,
and good night.

17:06.111 --> 17:08.814
I'm whipped.
I'm tired.

17:08.881 --> 17:10.214
What's going on?

17:10.282 --> 17:12.651
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

17:12.719 --> 17:15.488
Look at your hair!

17:15.555 --> 17:16.723
<i>Beautiful!</i>

17:16.790 --> 17:18.525
<i>Work it, girl.</i>

17:18.592 --> 17:19.559
Ooh, man.

17:19.627 --> 17:22.463
That just blew me away.

17:22.530 --> 17:24.098
Everything just kind
of flowed and--

17:25.532 --> 17:27.467
<i>Trevor, stop staring at me.</i>

17:27.535 --> 17:28.435
<i>What's in the bag</i>
<i>from Jose Eber?</i>

17:28.502 --> 17:29.969
Want me to show you?

17:30.037 --> 17:32.539
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

17:32.606 --> 17:34.941
This is how Gail walks
in the room,

17:35.008 --> 17:38.144
'cause she got
a broken-ass ankle.

17:38.212 --> 17:40.413
The bitch looks like she just
walked off of <i>Flashdance.</i>

17:40.481 --> 17:41.781
It didn't look good to me.

17:41.849 --> 17:43.350
Look like a mermaid.

17:45.519 --> 17:46.786
Well, congratulations.

17:46.854 --> 17:48.288
Congratulations.

17:48.355 --> 17:50.023
<i>You look very, very,</i>
<i>very pretty.</i>

17:50.091 --> 17:51.224
Let's kick some ass tomorrow
night at dinner service.

17:51.292 --> 17:52.826
That's all I'm thinking about.

17:52.894 --> 17:54.261
Gail winning
the challenge today

17:54.329 --> 17:56.463
doesn't make up for
the fact that she sucks.

17:56.531 --> 17:58.132
All right, I'll see you guys
upstairs.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.101
<i>Whatever.</i>

18:00.169 --> 18:03.338
She's definitely the next person
that needs to go.

18:08.111 --> 18:09.712
The remaining five Chefs know

18:09.779 --> 18:11.280
that to succeed
as individuals,

18:11.347 --> 18:12.714
they have to work as a group.

18:12.782 --> 18:14.015
I'm ready to go.

18:14.016 --> 18:15.784
A)
<i>I'm ready I'</i>

18:15.852 --> 18:16.885
just keep it gangster.
Do it!

18:16.953 --> 18:18.119
But not all of them...

18:18.187 --> 18:19.321
We got to take care
of ourselves.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.656
Right, man.

18:21.724 --> 18:23.858
Are feeling that team spirit.

18:23.926 --> 18:25.727
After yesterday
and how awesome

18:25.795 --> 18:27.663
she did with that challenge,
I feel like Gail's

18:27.730 --> 18:29.064
the easy target.

18:29.132 --> 18:30.565
Why does this veloute
keep exploding?

18:30.633 --> 18:33.068
I don't know.

18:33.136 --> 18:36.171
If she needs help,
I'm not gonna save her ass.

18:36.239 --> 18:39.107
It's coming down to every man
for themself.

18:39.175 --> 18:41.443
The citrus butter's ready?

18:41.510 --> 18:43.945
Where did my serrated knife go?

18:44.013 --> 18:46.548
Sorry. Sorry.
Whatever.

18:46.615 --> 18:48.483
I haven't been on top
of my game lately.

18:48.551 --> 18:50.284
Nobody's talking to me.

18:50.352 --> 18:54.156
I had better kick ass or else
I'm going home.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.876
The Chefs' dinner service
as one team was a disaster...

19:04.944 --> 19:07.046
Okay, guys, let's do this.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.547
And Chef Ramsay is looking
to motivate them...

19:08.615 --> 19:10.149
Right, let's go, guys.

19:10.216 --> 19:11.550
For a successful second attempt.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.152
I want a great service.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.788
I really need for you
guys to succeed.

19:15.856 --> 19:17.589
When we hit that end
of the evening

19:17.657 --> 19:19.325
and that last ticket's gone,

19:19.392 --> 19:20.425
<i>there's nothing like it</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

19:20.493 --> 19:21.693
Yes, Chef.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.561
Let's do stations.
Appetizers.

19:23.629 --> 19:25.296
Absolutely critical
to get off to a great start.

19:25.364 --> 19:26.731
Nona, that's you.
Yes, Chef.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.099
With Russell,
two of you on there.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.166
Yes, Chef.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.634
Fish...Jillian, it's you.

19:30.702 --> 19:32.269
Okay, Chef.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.937
<i>Own it.</i>
Yes, Chef. I will.

19:34.005 --> 19:35.672
"G" for garnish.
"G" for Gail is you.

19:35.740 --> 19:37.942
Yes, Chef.
Trev, meat.

19:38.009 --> 19:39.444
<i>You got it.</i>
Yeah?

19:39.511 --> 19:40.478
<i>Make it count, yeah?</i>
Yes, Chef.

19:40.546 --> 19:41.679
Let's get on our stations.

19:41.747 --> 19:43.448
Yes, Chef.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.417
If none of us can
do this dinner service tonight

19:45.484 --> 19:46.818
after everything
we've been through,

19:46.886 --> 19:48.087
then none of us deserve
to be here.

19:48.154 --> 19:49.088
You working fish, ma?

19:49.156 --> 19:50.356
Yeah.

19:50.424 --> 19:51.958
Are you comfortable
cooking scallops

19:52.025 --> 19:53.293
I've never cooked 'em,

19:53.361 --> 19:55.595
but I've watched 'em be
done, like, 8,000 times.

19:55.663 --> 19:57.797
You want to bang some out
and see--practice?

19:57.865 --> 19:59.332
It's not that hard.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.001
I cook scallops, halibut,
and salmon.

20:01.068 --> 20:02.368
That's it.

20:02.436 --> 20:04.270
I'm excited to work
the fish station.

20:04.338 --> 20:06.473
I really hope to blow Chef
Ramsay away tonight.

20:06.541 --> 20:07.974
James...
<i>Yes, Chef?</i>

20:08.042 --> 20:08.942
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.
Let's go.

20:09.010 --> 20:11.611
Yes, Chef.

20:13.000 --> 20:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:23.390 --> 20:25.457
The halibut.
The pan-seared halibut, please.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.992
The lobster spaghetti.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.260
I think I'm gonna
be really original

20:28.328 --> 20:30.596
and have the clam chowder.

20:30.664 --> 20:31.930
Four-top, Chef.
Four-top, thank you.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.832
Here we go, guys, yeah?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.200
<i>Nice, strong start</i>
<i>to the service.</i>

20:35.268 --> 20:36.568
You owe it to yourselves.

20:36.635 --> 20:38.003
On order, 4 couples,
table 52.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.471
Two scallops,
two spaghetti entree,

20:39.538 --> 20:40.705
one salmon, one Wellington,
two beef.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.006
Yes, Chef.
Thank you.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.308
Sounds like a kitchen.
Now cook like a kitchen.

20:43.375 --> 20:44.842
Seven minutes.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.144
Tell me when you're
about three minutes out.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.645
I'ma tell you every minute.

20:47.713 --> 20:49.314
Straight after that, two
scallops, one spaghetti, yes?

20:49.381 --> 20:50.949
Yes, Chef.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.250
The dinner service starts,
we're all communicating,

20:52.318 --> 20:53.517
and it's a great feeling.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.652
We're getting off
on the right foot.

20:54.719 --> 20:55.552
All the dead weight's gone.

20:55.620 --> 20:57.288
We should all just shine.

20:57.355 --> 20:58.989
Are you good on one minute
with two scallops, Jillian?

20:59.057 --> 21:00.591
Flipping my scallops
in about 30 seconds,

21:00.658 --> 21:02.092
so I need probably,
like, 1 minute.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.127
<i>One minute heard.</i>

21:03.194 --> 21:04.695
Walking up on garnish.

21:04.762 --> 21:05.795
Two spaghetti,
where is it?

21:05.863 --> 21:07.397
Walking.

21:07.464 --> 21:09.633
<i>Right.</i>
<i>Scallops now, please.</i>

21:09.700 --> 21:11.668
<i>Those scallops went</i>
<i>in ages ago. Come on.</i>

21:11.736 --> 21:13.304
Jillian, are you ready
on the last three scallops?

21:13.371 --> 21:14.905
They're not cooking evenly.

21:14.973 --> 21:16.173
Yeah, they're overcooked.

21:16.241 --> 21:17.541
Jillian, they're overcooked.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.210
I've never been
on the fish station

21:19.277 --> 21:20.845
when I had to cook scallops
and I feel

21:20.912 --> 21:22.513
like a total .

21:22.580 --> 21:24.715
<i>Start the spaghetti again then.</i>

21:24.783 --> 21:26.450
Guys, it's our first table.

21:26.517 --> 21:28.185
While the kitchen starts over

21:28.253 --> 21:29.586
on their first order
of appetizers,

21:29.654 --> 21:32.823
the dining room welcomes
a dignified table of 12.

21:40.831 --> 21:41.931
Marines come in.

21:41.998 --> 21:43.532
The dining room applauds them.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.168
I'm really excited
to cook food for them.

21:45.235 --> 21:47.070
I love men in uniform.

21:47.137 --> 21:48.304
With the dining room
filling up...

21:48.372 --> 21:49.405
I'll have the scallops.

21:49.473 --> 21:51.007
Beef rib eye.
Grilled salmon.

21:51.075 --> 21:53.343
And tickets pouring in...
Thank you.

21:53.411 --> 21:54.544
The pressure is on to get food
moving quickly

21:54.612 --> 21:55.712
out of the kitchen.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.047
It's the first table, guys!

21:57.115 --> 21:58.315
Coming right now, Chef.

21:58.383 --> 21:59.550
How is this possible?

21:59.618 --> 22:02.753
30 seconds, Chef.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.190
I have no idea what the
Is going on with Jillian.

22:05.257 --> 22:07.292
Just make sure you get as equal
amounts of color on both sides.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.827
She doesn't have that
fine-dining experience.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.663
She's just not up
to that level yet.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.031
Like, in this pan,
you can only do one order.

22:12.099 --> 22:13.399
This pan, only two.

22:13.467 --> 22:15.068
Just take 'em out.
But they're dead.

22:15.136 --> 22:16.837
<i>They have no color</i>
<i>on that side.</i>

22:16.904 --> 22:18.238
It just gets more
and more humiliating.

22:18.305 --> 22:19.472
<i>What am I doing wrong?</i>

22:19.540 --> 22:20.740
The pan's not hot enough

22:20.808 --> 22:22.108
and you're overcrowding it,
so it's boiling it.

22:22.176 --> 22:23.710
Scallops again.

22:23.777 --> 22:26.245
I got to get 'em going again.
They're overcrowded.

22:26.313 --> 22:27.680
<i>Start spaghetti again then.</i>

22:27.747 --> 22:28.714
Starting another spaghetti.

22:28.782 --> 22:30.082
Come on!

22:30.150 --> 22:31.984
My lobster spaghetti
takes seven minutes,

22:32.052 --> 22:34.219
so every time Jillian
messes up on the scallops,

22:34.287 --> 22:36.088
we're seven minutes
behind again.

22:36.155 --> 22:39.358
Chef is literally
about to kill us.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.626
How long on the scallops?

22:41.694 --> 22:43.161
<i>I'm going to the window</i>
<i>right now.</i>

22:43.228 --> 22:43.994
Going in the window.
Are you ready?

22:44.062 --> 22:44.962
<i>Yep.</i>

22:45.030 --> 22:46.630
Spaghetti?
Walking up.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.465
<i>Right, scallops cooked</i>
<i>perfectly.</i>

22:48.532 --> 22:49.499
<i>Now get a grip.</i>
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

22:49.567 --> 22:50.533
Come back to me.
I will, Chef.

22:50.601 --> 22:55.571
Pasta's raw.

22:55.639 --> 22:57.773
All of you,
this is .

22:57.841 --> 22:59.809
<i>Dining room filling up,</i>
<i>table of Marines,</i>

22:59.877 --> 23:02.578
<i>overcooked scallops,</i>
<i>and crunchy spaghetti.</i>

23:02.646 --> 23:05.281
What are we doing here?
Come on!

23:05.348 --> 23:07.316
<i>Start the spaghetti again then.</i>
<i>Dropping spaghetti.</i>

23:07.384 --> 23:09.352
Seven minutes out.

23:09.420 --> 23:10.720
We have got to get
this together

23:10.787 --> 23:12.388
or we are all toast.

23:12.455 --> 23:15.190
These customers are coming
for an experience up there.

23:15.258 --> 23:17.326
So far, we haven't even left
the ground yet.

23:17.393 --> 23:18.794
I think they're good.

23:18.861 --> 23:20.195
Once Russell showed me
it only takes

23:20.263 --> 23:21.863
a minute and a half,
I'm like,

23:21.931 --> 23:23.565
"I'm gonna count
to 90 every time

23:23.633 --> 23:24.666
just so I can get
perfect scallops.

23:24.734 --> 23:26.968
Ten, nine, eight,

23:27.036 --> 23:30.905
seven, six, five--

23:30.973 --> 23:32.374
I need scallops.
I need spaghetti. Let's go.

23:32.441 --> 23:34.242
So these are better, Chef?

23:34.310 --> 23:35.243
<i>Nona, spaghetti now!</i>

23:35.310 --> 23:36.410
Yes, Chef!

23:36.478 --> 23:37.878
Service.

23:37.946 --> 23:40.080
45 minutes into dinner service

23:40.148 --> 23:41.682
and a steady flow of appetizers
is finally leaving the kitchen.

23:43.418 --> 23:44.919
Oh.

23:44.986 --> 23:46.920
And the arrival
of another vip guest

23:46.988 --> 23:48.855
takes some of the focus
off of the kitchen.

23:48.923 --> 23:49.856
She looks great.
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:49.924 --> 23:51.124
She's beautiful.

23:51.192 --> 23:52.358
I'll do the salad
and the fish.

23:52.426 --> 23:53.893
Truffle salad?

23:53.961 --> 23:55.395
While Nona and Russell continue

23:55.463 --> 23:56.530
to work on appetizers...

23:56.597 --> 23:58.431
Let's go.
Service.

23:58.499 --> 24:00.233
Chef Ramsay is counting
on Trev on the meat...

24:00.301 --> 24:01.368
Two beef, one Wellington,
one salmon.

24:01.436 --> 24:02.903
I want to push this.

24:02.970 --> 24:03.903
And Jillian on the fish...

24:03.971 --> 24:05.305
Salmon in the oven.

24:05.372 --> 24:07.106
To get going on the entrees.

24:07.174 --> 24:09.042
The plan is to stand out
as an individual tonight.

24:09.109 --> 24:11.411
Ramsay put me at meat
for a reason.

24:11.479 --> 24:12.879
He wants to see what I can do.

24:12.947 --> 24:14.181
Jillian?

24:14.248 --> 24:15.548
Salmon's got about two minutes,
I'd say.

24:15.616 --> 24:17.150
You should be driving it.

24:17.218 --> 24:18.618
You're not waiting
for her, are you?

24:18.686 --> 24:19.819
No.
<i>No. Good.</i>

24:19.887 --> 24:20.820
<i>So you're telling her.</i>
All right.

24:20.888 --> 24:21.687
Five minutes to the window.

24:21.755 --> 24:23.522
Two beef, two halibut.

24:23.590 --> 24:25.057
Two beef, two halibut.
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

24:25.125 --> 24:25.957
Make it happen
in five minutes.

24:26.025 --> 24:27.659
That's what I need to hear.

24:27.727 --> 24:29.093
Jillian was getting
a little flustered

24:29.161 --> 24:30.194
over on the fish station.

24:30.262 --> 24:31.495
I needed to take
control of it

24:31.563 --> 24:32.229
and help her out as much
as I could,

24:32.297 --> 24:33.597
like always.

24:33.665 --> 24:36.067
Get the halibut rocking.
Those are ready to go.

24:36.135 --> 24:37.768
Why isn't the halibut seared?
<i>I don't know, Chef.</i>

24:37.836 --> 24:38.870
You're supposed
to be pre-searing it

24:38.937 --> 24:40.271
and pre-braising it.

24:40.339 --> 24:42.641
I mean, this is getting worse.
I'll help her out.

24:42.708 --> 24:44.510
If you don't do it right,
then get the

24:44.578 --> 24:46.012
Out of the way and
let me do it.

24:46.079 --> 24:47.346
I'm not gonna let us go down
that easy and that quick.

24:47.414 --> 24:48.781
It's like a joke.
Like you're just being punked.

24:48.849 --> 24:50.349
Like you're being set up
to look stupid.

24:50.417 --> 24:51.851
Jillian, when you
braise something

24:51.919 --> 24:52.919
and you want it
to cook fast,

24:52.986 --> 24:54.754
put that bitch
on the bottom.

24:54.822 --> 24:56.588
While Russell leaves
his appetizer station

24:56.656 --> 24:58.457
to help out Jillian on fish,
the kitchen is stuck

24:58.525 --> 25:00.893
in neutral and no food is making
it out to the dining room.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.861
Appetizer, appetizer,
appetizer.

25:02.929 --> 25:06.131
The cojo gets very cranky
when he doesn't have food.

25:06.198 --> 25:07.398
Cutting meat!

25:07.466 --> 25:08.432
Garnish to the window.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.234
Sauce, sauce.

25:10.301 --> 25:11.601
Walking up right now.
Going to the window
with meat.

25:11.669 --> 25:13.836
Salmon right now, Chef.

25:13.904 --> 25:15.371
I would have been
If Russell wouldn't

25:15.439 --> 25:16.072
have came and helped me.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.774
Service, please.

25:17.841 --> 25:19.543
But after tonight, I believe
Russell does have my back.

25:19.610 --> 25:21.344
Don't use tongs.
You'll break it up.

25:21.412 --> 25:22.679
Halibut, please!

25:22.747 --> 25:24.448
<i>30 seconds.</i>

25:24.516 --> 25:26.049
Nearly two hours
into dinner service,

25:26.117 --> 25:27.251
Russell's tutorial on the fish
station has paid off...

25:27.319 --> 25:28.619
Service.

25:28.687 --> 25:30.521
And the first set of entrees

25:30.589 --> 25:33.491
are making their way out
to the dining room.

25:33.559 --> 25:35.126
Now the Chefs must communicate

25:35.194 --> 25:36.762
and work together
to build momentum.

25:36.829 --> 25:38.363
Three beef, one Wellington,
five minutes to the window.

25:38.431 --> 25:40.832
I want it as fast as possible.

25:40.900 --> 25:44.669
Yes, Chef.

25:44.737 --> 25:46.337
Garnish, come on.
I need you to push it out.

25:46.405 --> 25:48.372
<i>How long?</i>

25:48.440 --> 25:49.840
Hey, answer me.

25:49.908 --> 25:51.508
That's all I want
is a answer.

25:51.576 --> 25:52.809
It was, like,
communication breakdown.

25:52.877 --> 25:54.244
I swear to God,
that's become our theme song.

25:54.311 --> 25:55.778
The scallops are in the pan.

25:55.846 --> 25:56.979
<i>Where is the scallop garnish?</i>

25:57.047 --> 25:58.181
You got the garnish?

25:58.249 --> 25:59.649
Oops.
Not ready yet.

25:59.717 --> 26:01.217
There's just so much going on.

26:01.285 --> 26:02.686
I only have two hands.

26:02.753 --> 26:05.121
Honestly, I am about
to walk out.

26:05.189 --> 26:06.222
I've had enough.

26:06.290 --> 26:07.857
<i>This is not normal.</i>

26:07.925 --> 26:09.425
We got off to a little bit
of a rocky start,

26:09.493 --> 26:11.127
but our key is
to keep rolling.

26:11.194 --> 26:12.928
Boom, bang.
Gail really up.

26:12.996 --> 26:15.163
Garnish, let's go!

26:15.231 --> 26:17.031
<i>Gail's just completely</i>
<i>non-communication--</i>

26:17.099 --> 26:19.268
no, I got it.
Garnish, let's go.

26:19.335 --> 26:21.703
Gail is literally shutting down.

26:21.770 --> 26:24.772
She's just like--

26:24.840 --> 26:26.641
come on, Gail.

26:26.709 --> 26:28.075
Snap out of it.

26:28.143 --> 26:29.543
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Let's go, Gail.

26:29.611 --> 26:31.645
Gail, one minute on garnish.

26:31.713 --> 26:33.613
<i>Give me what you've got,</i>
<i>please.</i>

26:33.681 --> 26:35.548
Get it in the window, Gail,
'cause I'm walking up right now.

26:35.616 --> 26:36.683
<i>Let's go.</i>

26:36.750 --> 26:38.117
This is Gail during service.

26:38.185 --> 26:39.619
Hmm.

26:39.687 --> 26:41.221
Please, let's go to the window.

26:41.289 --> 26:42.656
You want me to grab the garnish?

26:42.724 --> 26:44.291
No, no, no.
It's not ready yet.

26:44.359 --> 26:46.360
I'm trying not to stay
focused on garnish.

26:46.428 --> 26:48.296
I'm trying to make sure, like,
I have everything I need.

26:48.363 --> 26:50.231
Situation under control.
I got it.

26:50.299 --> 26:51.699
Come on, Gail.
You need to push it now.

26:51.767 --> 26:52.900
Three beef, one Wellingtons.

26:52.968 --> 26:54.268
Yes, Chef.

26:54.336 --> 26:55.870
Garnish up.
Please, let's go.

26:55.938 --> 26:57.105
Chef Ramsay expects

26:57.173 --> 26:57.806
a quality service
from the final five.

26:57.873 --> 26:59.373
Let's go.

26:59.441 --> 27:01.743
So far tonight,
all they've delivered

27:01.810 --> 27:04.979
hey, bozo.

27:05.047 --> 27:06.380
Mm-mm.

27:06.448 --> 27:08.883
Just all of you,
look at me now.

27:08.950 --> 27:10.685
It's like you're
doing it on purpose.

27:10.752 --> 27:12.120
Oh, Chef's losing it.

27:12.187 --> 27:15.656
Hard, undercooked,
and stone cold.

27:15.724 --> 27:17.091
Three beef,
our order on eight.

27:17.159 --> 27:19.894
Just put your finger
on that.

27:19.962 --> 27:20.928
<i>Look at us.</i>

27:20.996 --> 27:23.298
We deserve better than this.

27:23.366 --> 27:27.903
Where's your passion?

27:27.971 --> 27:29.705
I'm done standing here
with a bunch of idiots.

27:29.773 --> 27:30.773
<i>You all.</i>

27:30.841 --> 27:35.044
Good luck, superstars.

27:35.112 --> 27:37.980
Useless.
Aye-yi-yi.

27:38.048 --> 27:39.882
We are .

27:39.950 --> 27:40.950
Come on!

27:41.017 --> 27:42.584
Oh, man.

27:42.652 --> 27:46.521
Oh, there he is.

27:46.588 --> 27:47.655
He's left.

27:47.723 --> 27:49.290
This is over.
Over.

27:49.357 --> 27:50.557
He was angry.

27:50.625 --> 27:51.625
He was mad.

27:54.829 --> 27:57.864
I'm gonna do somebody some
damage if I stay in there.

28:03.077 --> 28:05.111
Almost two hours into
an extremely disappointing

28:05.179 --> 28:07.046
performance
by the final five...

28:07.114 --> 28:09.983
Hard, undercooked,
and stone cold.

28:10.051 --> 28:12.385
Trev's undercooked beef
has pushed

28:12.453 --> 28:14.320
Chef Ramsay over the edge...

28:14.388 --> 28:17.357
Mm-mm.

28:17.424 --> 28:18.591
You all.

28:18.659 --> 28:19.892
<i>Good luck.</i>

28:19.960 --> 28:22.028
And out the door.

28:22.095 --> 28:23.162
Holy .

28:23.230 --> 28:24.430
What the just happened?

28:24.498 --> 28:26.632
Chef is pissed.

28:26.700 --> 28:27.867
Me.

28:27.934 --> 28:29.502
Let's go!
Come on. Recover.

28:29.569 --> 28:31.270
We as a team have
to prove to Chef Ramsay

28:31.337 --> 28:33.405
that we're not quitters.

28:33.473 --> 28:35.707
Trev, do you have a beef

28:35.775 --> 28:36.975
to go with that welly
that's waiting?

28:37.043 --> 28:38.710
Yes, they're in.

28:38.778 --> 28:40.612
With Chef Ramsay out
of the kitchen,

28:40.680 --> 28:43.215
Nona and Russell step up
to try to get food out

28:43.282 --> 28:44.416
to the hungry diners.

28:44.483 --> 28:45.683
Four more beef on order.

28:45.751 --> 28:46.784
Here come the beef.

28:46.852 --> 28:47.986
Beef and garnish.

28:48.053 --> 28:49.420
She's got your
polenta fries.

28:49.488 --> 28:50.988
Wellington coming on
it's heels.

28:51.056 --> 28:54.759
Yo, bro, it's dead.
It's dead.

28:54.827 --> 28:57.061
Look at it.
It's brown.

28:57.129 --> 28:59.297
Do you want me to shave it?
No, you can't sell that.

28:59.365 --> 29:01.232
What do you want me to do?
Three more?

29:01.300 --> 29:02.734
I want you to go upstairs,
pack your plaid shirt,

29:02.801 --> 29:05.370
take your skinny
Brown-tooth ass home.

29:05.438 --> 29:06.938
What do you want me to do?

29:07.006 --> 29:08.873
I don't want you
to cook any food,

29:08.941 --> 29:10.642
because I don't feel like
the food you cook is acceptable.

29:10.710 --> 29:12.176
I want you to get three
more beef, because it can't--

29:12.244 --> 29:13.644
we got six and then
we got an order for four.

29:13.712 --> 29:14.479
I don't have enough.

29:14.546 --> 29:16.147
Who put you on the wheel?

29:16.214 --> 29:17.615
Last time I checked,
this was Ramsay's house,

29:17.683 --> 29:18.816
not House of Russell.

29:18.884 --> 29:20.618
They're all dead, dude.

29:20.686 --> 29:22.186
They're way, way over.

29:22.254 --> 29:24.956
The re-fires are gonna
take seven minutes.

29:25.023 --> 29:26.790
He's .

29:26.858 --> 29:29.426
Chef Russell has turned away
Trev's meat...

29:29.494 --> 29:30.661
Trev, what are we doing?

29:30.728 --> 29:32.195
Re-firing every steak I got.

29:32.263 --> 29:33.129
But Nona's appetizers...

29:33.197 --> 29:34.464
Table one.

29:34.531 --> 29:35.431
Have been deemed worthy.

29:35.499 --> 29:36.398
Very moist.

29:36.466 --> 29:38.767
Finally.
I know.

29:38.835 --> 29:40.735
Back in the kitchen,

29:40.803 --> 29:42.003
Trev makes a second attempt
on his meat.

29:42.071 --> 29:43.571
Come on, come on.

29:43.638 --> 29:45.272
I can have three beef
in a minute and a half.

29:45.340 --> 29:47.207
Then I'm gonna need
one Wellington also.

29:47.275 --> 29:48.943
Okay, Wellington resting.

29:49.010 --> 29:50.277
All three of those steaks
that I brought up

29:50.345 --> 29:51.244
to Russell
at the pass were fine,

29:51.312 --> 29:52.913
so I flashed 'em off.

29:52.981 --> 29:54.415
I've been cooking now
professionally for five years.

29:54.482 --> 29:55.682
It's got to get done.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.150
I'm ready to get this food out.

29:57.218 --> 29:58.518
<i>We have garnish?</i>

29:58.586 --> 29:59.853
Garnish is walking.
Y'all ready?

29:59.921 --> 30:01.254
<i>Look at that.</i>

30:01.322 --> 30:02.889
This is dead.
This is dead.

30:02.957 --> 30:03.923
You can't sell that.

30:03.991 --> 30:05.658
Yeah, right, dude.

30:05.726 --> 30:07.594
The meat was gray.

30:07.661 --> 30:08.628
It was dead.

30:08.696 --> 30:10.262
There's no moisture left in 'em.

30:10.330 --> 30:11.897
Okay, then I'm working
with the ones

30:11.965 --> 30:13.031
that I got cooking
in the oven.

30:13.099 --> 30:13.798
I was trying
to make something work.

30:13.866 --> 30:15.733
I'm ready to kick him out.

30:15.801 --> 30:19.503
Trev re-fired this rib eye that
had sat there for 15 minutes,

30:19.571 --> 30:21.705
then tried to bring
it back up.

30:21.773 --> 30:23.474
Very few entrees
are leaving the kitchen...

30:23.541 --> 30:25.008
Do we have awe could sell?

30:25.076 --> 30:26.210
Read off the tickets.

30:26.277 --> 30:30.047
Three beef, one Wellington.

30:30.115 --> 30:31.482
And returned to give
our finalists

30:31.550 --> 30:33.818
one last chance at redemption.

30:33.885 --> 30:35.887
Just all of you,
look at me now.

30:35.955 --> 30:38.123
Take a look at the big table in
the center of the dining room.

30:38.191 --> 30:40.058
Here, here.

30:40.126 --> 30:41.193
They're Marines.

30:41.261 --> 30:42.761
They fight back for a living.

30:42.829 --> 30:44.330
Get your together,
wake up,

30:44.397 --> 30:45.965
or off out of here.

30:46.033 --> 30:48.333
You, get the off meat.

30:48.401 --> 30:49.601
<i>Russ, on meat.</i>
<i>Trev, appetizer.</i>

30:49.669 --> 30:50.903
Jillian, get to the garnish.

30:50.970 --> 30:52.004
Gail, get on the fish.

30:52.071 --> 30:53.005
Yes, Chef.

30:53.072 --> 30:54.506
Next mistake, get out.

30:54.574 --> 30:56.608
Chef Ramsay came back
in the kitchen.

30:56.676 --> 30:58.143
Then he was like,
"Gail, Jillian, switch."

30:58.211 --> 31:02.514
I'm like, "are you serious?"

31:02.581 --> 31:04.482
Your halibut and salmon
are seared off.

31:04.550 --> 31:05.684
Okay.

31:05.752 --> 31:06.752
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Let's go, Gail.

31:06.820 --> 31:07.586
Yes, Chef.

31:07.654 --> 31:09.287
I've been on the fish station,

31:09.355 --> 31:10.589
you know, twice already
and I up,

31:10.657 --> 31:11.957
so I had better kick ass.

31:12.025 --> 31:13.592
If not, I deserve to go home.

31:13.660 --> 31:15.061
Trevor, he said not
to crowd 'em.

31:15.129 --> 31:16.662
You got three
on the same sizzle tray.

31:16.730 --> 31:18.465
What the ?

31:18.532 --> 31:19.599
<i>You said you needed</i>
<i>three flying.</i>

31:19.667 --> 31:20.700
I got three flying.

31:20.768 --> 31:22.169
But they're dead already, bro.

31:22.236 --> 31:24.137
Trevor, I got two words for you.

31:24.205 --> 31:25.472
Go home.

31:26.974 --> 31:28.474
Let alone cook a steak properly.

31:28.541 --> 31:30.242
Three beef, one Wellington,
urgently.

31:30.309 --> 31:32.344
Yes, Chef.
Let's go then.

31:32.411 --> 31:33.678
More than two hours
into dinner service

31:33.746 --> 31:35.379
and Chef Ramsay's
station switch...

31:35.447 --> 31:37.314
30 seconds, beef.

31:37.382 --> 31:38.582
Seems to have reinvigorated
the Chefs...

31:38.650 --> 31:39.817
Service, please.

31:39.884 --> 31:41.251
And entrees are once again

31:41.319 --> 31:43.086
making their way out
to the dining room.

31:43.153 --> 31:44.353
Ooh.
Mmm.

31:44.421 --> 31:45.989
Wow.
The steak's good.

31:46.056 --> 31:47.857
But their biggest challenge...

31:47.925 --> 31:49.192
Now we're working
the Marines table.

31:49.259 --> 31:51.461
Five beef, four Wellington,
three salmon.

31:51.529 --> 31:53.163
Is still ahead of them.

31:53.230 --> 31:54.530
Let's go, Gail.
Salmon's ready, yes?

31:54.598 --> 31:57.667
<i>Got a salmon.</i>

31:57.734 --> 31:58.868
Gail.
Yes, Chef?

31:58.936 --> 31:59.836
<i>Come here.</i>

31:59.904 --> 32:01.104
Raw salmon.

32:01.172 --> 32:02.772
Get out.
Straight away!

32:02.840 --> 32:05.141
Get out!

32:05.209 --> 32:06.243
That damn salmon.

32:06.310 --> 32:07.777
So disappointed in myself.

32:07.845 --> 32:09.879
I don't know why
I can't cook fish.

32:09.947 --> 32:13.917
I thought I would be able to
turn this whole thing around.

32:13.985 --> 32:15.952
With Gail out of the kitchen,

32:16.020 --> 32:19.422
it's up to Russell,
Nona, Trev, and Jillian

32:19.490 --> 32:20.657
to complete the final table:

32:20.725 --> 32:22.025
A 12-top of Marines.

32:22.093 --> 32:23.960
We can start plating the garnish ?

32:24.028 --> 32:25.328
Let's go.
Obviously it's a 12-top.

32:25.396 --> 32:26.330
They all can't come
at the same time.

32:26.397 --> 32:27.531
Let's go.

32:27.599 --> 32:28.465
<i>Three salmon garnish.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

32:28.533 --> 32:29.733
Yes, Chef.

32:29.801 --> 32:30.868
Going up to the window
with Wellingtons.

32:30.936 --> 32:32.437
Service, please.

32:32.504 --> 32:34.405
Sorry for the wait.

32:34.473 --> 32:36.975
Thank you.
Wow.

32:37.043 --> 32:38.911
Jillian?
Yes, Chef?

32:38.978 --> 32:41.346
Come here.
You just gave me that.

32:41.414 --> 32:42.615
<i>Jillian just took</i>
<i>that out the oven</i>

32:42.682 --> 32:44.216
and gave it to me.

32:44.284 --> 32:45.785
I know it's easy for you
strappy little,

32:45.852 --> 32:47.319
stuck-up little bitch.

32:47.387 --> 32:48.820
<i>I care for those guys</i>
<i>out there.</i>

32:48.888 --> 32:50.088
Look.
They're raw.

32:50.156 --> 32:52.857
Off.

32:52.924 --> 32:54.491
How rude are you?

32:54.559 --> 32:57.627
The only thing that's missing
is the feathers.

33:01.900 --> 33:04.835
Over two hours into
a disastrous dinner service...

33:04.902 --> 33:06.837
Next mistake, get out.

33:06.904 --> 33:08.739
Chef Ramsay issued
an ultimatum...

33:08.806 --> 33:09.973
<i>Gail. Raw salmon.</i>

33:10.041 --> 33:11.642
Get out.

33:11.709 --> 33:12.910
That he has made good
on with Gail...

33:12.977 --> 33:13.877
Get out!

33:13.945 --> 33:14.645
And now...

33:14.712 --> 33:17.380
Off.

33:17.448 --> 33:19.181
The only thing that's missing
is the feathers.

33:19.249 --> 33:20.482
Now it's up to Russell,
Trev, and Nona

33:20.550 --> 33:21.850
to complete the 12-top of
Marines

33:21.918 --> 33:23.686
and finish dinner service.

33:23.753 --> 33:25.421
Okay, I need three more beef.
Yes.

33:25.489 --> 33:26.021
Everything else is ready
to go, Chef.

33:26.089 --> 33:27.323
Service, please.

33:27.391 --> 33:28.524
<i>Apologize for the delay,</i>
<i>will you?</i>

33:28.592 --> 33:29.191
It's very good.
Very good.

33:29.259 --> 33:30.259
Enjoy your meal.

33:30.326 --> 33:31.427
Switch everything off.
Let's go.

33:31.495 --> 33:35.265
Let's go.
Wipe down.

33:35.332 --> 33:38.835
Tonight was the most
frustrating time

33:38.903 --> 33:41.605
I've ever had in the history
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

33:41.673 --> 33:44.874
I feel really deeply let down.

33:44.942 --> 33:48.945
A table of Marines
returning from duty.

33:49.013 --> 33:51.948
1 hour, 15 minutes before
any appetizers got out.

33:52.016 --> 33:54.317
It was like you didn't care.

33:54.385 --> 33:55.918
Jillian, scallops.
What happened?

33:55.986 --> 33:57.420
I don't know, Chef.

33:57.487 --> 33:59.655
I'm asking myself
the same question.

33:59.723 --> 34:01.757
You had much better services
weeks ago

34:01.825 --> 34:03.091
when you were blue and red.

34:03.159 --> 34:04.559
<i>Maybe black's not your color.</i>

34:04.627 --> 34:05.827
<i>Maybe you shouldn't be here.</i>

34:05.895 --> 34:07.829
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

34:07.897 --> 34:10.197
Gail, you may be better off

34:10.266 --> 34:13.400
as a short-order Chef,

34:13.467 --> 34:16.402
because you can only cook
one table at a time.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.304
If you ever open
a restaurant,

34:18.371 --> 34:19.705
make sure it's done
in your living room

34:19.773 --> 34:20.973
with one table.

34:21.041 --> 34:22.608
Trev?

34:22.676 --> 34:24.309
Yes, Chef?

34:24.377 --> 34:26.678
Meat seared on the outside,
cold in the middle.

34:26.746 --> 34:27.911
It was cold.

34:27.980 --> 34:29.447
Stone cold.
<i>Yep.</i>

34:29.514 --> 34:31.550
<i>It was chaos.</i>

34:31.617 --> 34:32.583
That's me at my Max.

34:32.652 --> 34:33.717
I've got to get out.

34:33.786 --> 34:36.286
<i>You drove me to that.</i>

34:36.355 --> 34:38.621
<i>All of you,</i>
<i>come up with two individuals</i>

34:38.690 --> 34:39.889
for elimination.

34:39.958 --> 34:43.960
Get out.

34:44.029 --> 34:47.331
Chef Ramsay was clearly
disappointed in our service

34:47.399 --> 34:49.234
and I can't say
that I blame him.

34:49.302 --> 34:50.502
We let him down and we got
to vote two people out,

34:50.570 --> 34:51.870
so we got something
to think about.

34:51.938 --> 34:53.304
Honestly, I don't think
any of us

34:53.371 --> 34:55.040
have anything to be proud of.

34:55.108 --> 34:58.544
You guys did fine on apps.

34:58.612 --> 35:00.813
I was having a rough time
communicating with Gail.

35:00.881 --> 35:02.848
I was having a horrible time
communicating with Gail.

35:02.916 --> 35:04.249
As always.

35:04.317 --> 35:07.786
I'll vote for myself.

35:07.854 --> 35:09.287
He tells me, "you should be
a short-order cook

35:09.355 --> 35:11.189
in your living room."

35:11.256 --> 35:13.858
I don't think Gail's able
to handle the pressure.

35:13.926 --> 35:15.926
It just doesn't work
in Hell's Kitchen.

35:15.994 --> 35:18.228
You got to be a tough-ass
to be up in here.

35:22.099 --> 35:24.601
Those steaks were sitting up
there sliced for 15 minutes

35:24.669 --> 35:25.902
<i>and you tried to flash 'em.</i>

35:25.970 --> 35:27.337
I lost some respect for you,

35:27.405 --> 35:28.705
because you tried to pull
a fast one on us.

35:28.773 --> 35:30.508
Oh, off
and go home already.

35:30.575 --> 35:32.443
My steak might
have been the straw

35:32.511 --> 35:34.045
that broke the camel's back,
but there was a lot

35:34.112 --> 35:35.547
of that happened
before that happened.

35:35.615 --> 35:38.217
I'm really sick of being
the punching bag around here

35:38.284 --> 35:39.451
when it comes
to elimination.

35:39.519 --> 35:40.853
Trev...

35:40.920 --> 35:43.523
And here we go again.
Round two.

35:43.590 --> 35:46.192
You just start shouting
and it's complete chaos.

35:46.259 --> 35:47.560
Nothing is coming
out of your mouth

35:47.627 --> 35:48.794
as far as communication.

35:48.862 --> 35:50.129
It's literally just noise.

35:50.197 --> 35:52.064
Go yourself.

35:52.132 --> 35:53.799
I don't think I did
anything wrong tonight at all.

35:53.867 --> 35:55.834
I don't.

35:55.902 --> 35:57.735
I'm gonna vote for Jillian
because of the scallops.

35:57.803 --> 35:59.304
So that's my vote.

35:59.372 --> 36:01.539
I know I
Up tonight,

36:01.607 --> 36:02.974
but this is the first
dinner service that I've had

36:03.042 --> 36:04.209
<i>that I sucked.</i>

36:04.276 --> 36:05.510
Even though I
Up though,

36:05.578 --> 36:07.045
I never gave up tonight.

36:07.113 --> 36:08.714
I'd send 'em all home.

36:08.781 --> 36:10.649
I don't give a .
Do it.

36:10.717 --> 36:12.218
You know, you pissed
it away yourself.

36:12.286 --> 36:13.252
Go home.
I don't care.

36:13.320 --> 36:14.320
Send 'em all three home.

36:14.388 --> 36:16.356
Start the finals tomorrow.

36:27.301 --> 36:29.402
Nona...

36:29.470 --> 36:30.803
First nominee and why?

36:30.871 --> 36:34.239
Our first nominee is...

36:34.307 --> 36:35.774
Gail.

36:35.842 --> 36:37.075
<i>She wasn't communicating.</i>

36:37.143 --> 36:38.576
<i>She was in her own bubble</i>

36:38.644 --> 36:40.878
and she had shutdown.

36:40.946 --> 36:42.680
Second nominee and why?

36:42.748 --> 36:44.816
The second nominee is...

36:46.819 --> 36:49.687
Um...

36:54.419 --> 36:57.054
Chef Ramsay has asked
for two nominees

36:57.122 --> 36:58.856
for elimination tonight
and while Nona

36:58.924 --> 37:00.490
was quick to name the first...

37:00.558 --> 37:02.458
Gail.

37:02.526 --> 37:05.094
The second is proving
to be a little more difficult.

37:05.162 --> 37:09.365
Um, the second nominee...

37:11.501 --> 37:13.802
Is Trev.

37:15.304 --> 37:18.006
He was an absolute disaster
on meat.

37:18.074 --> 37:21.376
When you walked out and Russ and
I tried to run the pass,

37:21.444 --> 37:23.211
he took the meat and tried
to re-fire it.

37:23.279 --> 37:25.780
Really?

37:25.848 --> 37:27.615
Is that true, Trev?

37:27.683 --> 37:30.051
I wasn't trying
to sneak anything in there.

37:30.119 --> 37:31.319
<i>I think everybody knows</i>

37:31.387 --> 37:33.388
that's not my m.O.

37:33.456 --> 37:35.524
So why send it
if it wasn't right?

37:35.591 --> 37:36.992
I was just trying
to make something work.

37:38.227 --> 37:40.228
<i>Wow.</i>

37:40.296 --> 37:44.199
<i>I feel really deeply let down</i>
<i>because of one individual.</i>

37:44.266 --> 37:45.933
Jillian.

37:46.001 --> 37:47.702
<i>We may have gone</i>
<i>to hell and back.</i>

37:47.770 --> 37:53.141
How dare you send me
a raw egg?

37:53.208 --> 37:54.442
I know I disappointed you.

37:54.509 --> 37:56.277
I disappointed myself.

37:56.344 --> 37:58.612
<i>But I have fought every day</i>
<i>since I've been here.</i>

37:58.680 --> 37:59.980
<i>I am not ready to go home,</i>
<i>Chef.</i>

38:00.048 --> 38:01.448
Not at all.

38:01.516 --> 38:02.616
Better pull it back.

38:02.684 --> 38:04.718
I didn't like what I saw.

38:04.786 --> 38:06.753
Okay, Trev, Gail, let's go.

38:11.593 --> 38:13.060
Gail...

38:13.128 --> 38:15.696
<i>The big question</i>
<i>i have for you:</i>

38:15.764 --> 38:18.966
Do you care?
Because I'm not so sure.

38:19.034 --> 38:21.436
Of course I care.

38:21.503 --> 38:23.471
When you kicked me out,
I was bawling my eyes out.

38:23.538 --> 38:24.639
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to disappoint myself.</i>

38:24.707 --> 38:26.341
I don't want
to disappoint my team.

38:26.408 --> 38:28.042
It's too early for me to go.

38:28.110 --> 38:29.511
<i>I have so much more</i>
<i>to give you.</i>

38:29.578 --> 38:31.946
I could give you my arm
if you want me to.

38:32.014 --> 38:34.515
Oh, dear, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear.

38:34.583 --> 38:36.250
<i>Uh, Trev,</i>

38:36.318 --> 38:38.119
truthfully,
are you in over your head?

38:38.186 --> 38:39.787
No, I'm not in over my head.

38:39.855 --> 38:41.155
What have you got left
that I haven't seen?

38:41.223 --> 38:43.991
Excellence.

38:44.059 --> 38:45.259
I can do this.

38:45.327 --> 38:47.028
<i>I know I can.</i>

38:47.095 --> 38:48.696
This cannot be
the end.

38:48.763 --> 38:50.164
I won't accept it
for myself at all.

38:50.231 --> 38:51.499
<i>Come on, Trev.</i>

38:51.566 --> 38:52.800
That's my decision.

38:52.868 --> 38:56.838
<i>That's not your call.</i>

38:56.905 --> 39:00.609
Okay.

39:00.676 --> 39:04.179
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen...

39:04.247 --> 39:07.850
Is...

39:10.588 --> 39:14.658
Gail.

39:14.726 --> 39:18.562
Give me your jacket.

39:18.630 --> 39:20.063
When you arrived
in Hell's Kitchen,

39:20.131 --> 39:21.932
you showed such skill

39:22.000 --> 39:25.035
and I honestly thought that you
were gonna go a lot further.

39:25.102 --> 39:27.304
Good night.

39:27.371 --> 39:29.238
Thank you.
Thank you.

39:34.310 --> 39:36.878
I wish I could have stayed
longer, but my time was up.

39:36.946 --> 39:38.780
That chicken is sexy.

39:38.847 --> 39:40.681
I thought I was a strong cook
before I came to Hell's Kitchen.

39:40.749 --> 39:42.349
Eggs right here.
Hot handle. Be careful.

39:42.417 --> 39:43.850
Who made that risotto?
I did, Chef.

39:43.918 --> 39:45.084
You raised the bar now.
You stay above it.

39:45.152 --> 39:46.853
I told you I could cook.

39:46.920 --> 39:48.588
But now after leaving
Hell's Kitchen...

39:48.655 --> 39:50.089
That is under-seasoned.

39:50.156 --> 39:52.224
<i>Gail, how long?</i>

39:52.292 --> 39:53.525
Gail, wakey, wakey!

39:53.593 --> 39:54.793
<i>Get a grip!</i>

39:54.861 --> 39:56.161
I think I realized that I have

39:56.229 --> 39:57.295
a few things to work on.

39:57.363 --> 39:59.397
I think your pan's
a bit too hot.

39:59.465 --> 40:00.732
Get out!
Yes, Chef.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.533
I did disappoint myself.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.969
I'm so sorry, guys.
It happens.

40:05.037 --> 40:06.671
You’re the most
<i>experienced.</i>

40:06.739 --> 40:08.373
It's not good enough!

40:08.441 --> 40:09.407
But there are
so many highlights.

40:10.743 --> 40:11.909
Gail?
Yes, Chef?

40:11.977 --> 40:13.044
This beef is beautifully cooked.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.246
Winning the challenges...

40:16.314 --> 40:17.648
Thanks, guys.

40:17.715 --> 40:19.016
And getting to go
on the rewards...

40:20.585 --> 40:22.352
Voila.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.354
They totally outweigh
all the lowlights.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.755
He tells me, "you should be
a short-order cook

40:25.823 --> 40:27.323
in your living room."

40:27.391 --> 40:30.592
I leave here with great
memories, new friends,

40:30.660 --> 40:34.629
fantastic clothes,
and a great haircut.

40:34.697 --> 40:38.232
Back in line.

40:38.299 --> 40:41.001
All four of you,
regroup

40:41.069 --> 40:42.469
<i>and come back</i>

40:42.537 --> 40:43.938
at a thousand
miles an hour tomorrow.

40:44.006 --> 40:45.406
Yes, Chef.

40:45.473 --> 40:46.673
Good night.

40:46.741 --> 40:49.109
Good night, Chef.

40:49.177 --> 40:51.445
The light is there
shining brightly

40:51.513 --> 40:53.147
at the end of the tunnel.

40:53.215 --> 40:55.817
I'm going to fight until Chef
either kills me

40:55.885 --> 40:57.985
or until I win.

40:58.053 --> 40:59.721
Trevor is way over his head.

40:59.788 --> 41:01.689
He is in a submarine
underwater.

41:01.757 --> 41:04.359
He has no chance to win.

41:04.427 --> 41:06.762
Here I am in the final four.
What about that?

41:06.830 --> 41:08.964
I told you guys not
to underestimate me.

41:09.032 --> 41:11.233
Watch out for the dark horse,
'cause I climbed my way

41:11.301 --> 41:13.803
to the top of the mountain,
for crying out loud.

41:13.871 --> 41:16.305
I have to show that
this is my kitchen.

41:16.373 --> 41:19.108
So here's the new plan:
I'm taking the reins right now.

41:19.176 --> 41:20.742
If anybody's standing
in my way,

41:20.810 --> 41:22.410
they're just gonna have
to get out.

41:22.478 --> 41:24.445
Gail's performance
at Hell's Kitchen

41:24.513 --> 41:26.681
was up and down, up and down,
and up and down.

41:26.748 --> 41:28.749
Roller coasters are great
for amusement parks,

41:28.816 --> 41:31.651
not kitchens.

41:35.022 --> 41:36.823
The winner of <i>Hell's Kitchen</i>

41:36.891 --> 41:38.591
will become head Chef
of the brand-new

41:38.659 --> 41:40.694
multimillion dollar restaurant
L.A. Market

41:40.762 --> 41:43.530
at the J.W. Marriott Hotel
in downtown Los Angeles.

41:43.598 --> 41:45.966
The salary: A $1/4 million.

41:47.936 --> 41:49.938
And they will also
tour the country

41:50.006 --> 41:52.307
as the official spokesperson
of Rosemount Estate Winery.

41:52.375 --> 41:54.276
Next time on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

41:54.344 --> 41:56.645
The final four are prepared
to do whatever it takes...

41:56.713 --> 41:58.146
Is that your best?
No, it's not my best.

41:58.214 --> 41:59.581
Well, give me your best!

41:59.649 --> 42:00.783
To achieve their dream...

42:00.850 --> 42:02.518
Come on, Trev, get it done.

42:02.585 --> 42:04.720
Buy's standards
are higher than ever.

42:06.122 --> 42:07.422
It's undercooked!

42:07.490 --> 42:08.856
It's raw!
Come here, you.

42:08.924 --> 42:10.390
Oh, my God.
Come here.

42:10.458 --> 42:11.658
I knew it.
And you as well.

42:11.726 --> 42:13.426
Come on.
Come here!

42:13.494 --> 42:15.528
Has Trev made his last mistake?

42:15.596 --> 42:16.596
<i>Look at me in the eyes.</i>

42:16.663 --> 42:17.397
Out! Out!

42:17.464 --> 42:19.132
<i>Get out!</i>

42:19.200 --> 42:21.334
Has Jillian run out
of second chances?

42:21.402 --> 42:22.636
It's such a shame!

42:22.703 --> 42:23.736
<i>I want two minutes with you.</i>

42:23.804 --> 42:25.271
<i>Let's go.</i>

42:25.339 --> 42:26.673
Any given second, Chef
could tap you on the shoulder

42:26.741 --> 42:27.841
and say, "go home."

42:27.909 --> 42:29.409
That makes me scared as .

42:29.477 --> 42:31.312
You want to go home?

42:31.380 --> 42:33.347
And what about bad boy Russell?

42:33.415 --> 42:35.483
If you talk to me like you
talked to me before...

42:35.551 --> 42:37.052
This time, he may have gone
too far.

42:37.119 --> 42:38.153
I will slap the
Out of you.

42:38.220 --> 42:39.554
What? Whoa.

42:39.621 --> 42:40.988
And you'll find out why...

42:41.056 --> 42:43.024
You know what those doors mean.

42:43.092 --> 42:45.960
Nona is an emotional wreck
at the end of the night.

42:46.028 --> 42:48.029
Oh, my God.

42:48.097 --> 42:49.931
The questions all get answered

42:49.998 --> 42:51.832
on the most intense episode
of the season.

42:51.900 --> 42:53.300
I have a fire burning
bigger than any

42:53.368 --> 42:55.036
California wildfire ever.

42:55.103 --> 42:57.471
Next time on <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>
