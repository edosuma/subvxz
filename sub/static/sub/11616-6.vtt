08:45.259 --> 08:46.825
YOU NEVER LEAVE
A MAN BEHIND.

08:48.428 --> 08:49.794
MAN ON TV: IN TURBULENT TIMES,

08:49.796 --> 08:52.230
WHEN TENSIONS WITH THE
MIDDLE EAST ARE AT A PEAK...

08:52.232 --> 08:53.298

08:54.835 --> 08:58.136

A CASE FOR BASEBALL, AND THAT...

08:58.138 --> 09:00.071
PERFECT TIMING.
THEY'RE JUST ABOUT
TO DISCUSS

09:00.073 --> 09:03.508
THE BASEBALL GAME
FOR THE 27TH TIME
THIS MORNING.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.477
LISTEN, YOU SAID
THAT I SHOULD COME TO YOU

09:05.479 --> 09:07.112
WHEN I WAS READY
FOR THE TRUTH.

09:07.114 --> 09:10.515
SO, I'M HERE
AND YOU'RE...HUNGOVER.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.784
STRICTLY SPEAKING,
I WOULD CLASSIFY THIS

09:12.786 --> 09:14.519
AS MORE DRUNK
THAN HUNGOVER.

09:14.521 --> 09:18.323
MAN ON TV: ...BASEBALL GOING,
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT ATLANTA--

09:18.325 --> 09:20.191
HAD A COP
AT THE HOSPITAL

09:20.193 --> 09:21.760
WHO THINKS THAT
THEY'VE BEEN LYING TO US

09:21.762 --> 09:23.261
ABOUT PATIENT ZERO.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.529
MIGHT NOT BE
THE SYRIAN.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.097
COULD BE A COVER-UP.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.033
NOW, WE JUST NEED
TO GET THE TAPE

09:28.035 --> 09:30.201

SECURITY FEED...

09:31.271 --> 09:33.305

09:33.307 --> 09:35.206

09:35.208 --> 09:36.608
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:37.544 --> 09:39.578
MY FRIENDS.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.413
I ASKED THEM TO
EXPLORE THE CORDON,

09:41.415 --> 09:43.114
TO GET VIDEO FOR ME.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.352
"FEED THE BEAST,"
I SAID.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.321
I RISKED THEIR LIVES
SO I COULD

09:49.323 --> 09:50.689
GET A SCOOP.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.158
I'M THE BEAST.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.194
NOT IF YOU MAKE SURE
IT WASN'T FOR NOTHING.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.463
THERE ARE SOME POWERFUL
PEOPLE THAT CONTROL THE FATE

09:58.465 --> 10:00.365
OF EVERYONE
INSIDE THE CORDON.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.566
NOW, FROM
THE VERY BEGINNING,

10:01.568 --> 10:03.535
YOU BELIEVED THAT
THEY WERE LYING TO US.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.470
WHAT IF WE CAN PROVE
THAT YOU WERE RIGHT?

10:05.472 --> 10:07.072

10:09.076 --> 10:10.942

10:10.944 --> 10:13.044

NEED ME FOR, ANYWAY?

10:17.618 --> 10:19.851
YOU'RE A COP
WHO WANTS
SECURITY VIDEO.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.019

WALK INTO THAT

10:21.021 --> 10:22.721

OFF THE HIGHWAY,

10:22.723 --> 10:23.822

WHATEVER YOU WANT.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.491

LOMMERS TO KNOW

10:26.493 --> 10:27.892
EXACTLY WHAT I'M INTO.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.830
I THOUGHT ABOUT
USING THIS WARRANT

10:31.832 --> 10:33.565
FOR AN OLD CASE
AT THE HOSPITAL.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.133
THAT WOULD GET ME IN
WITH A LEGIT REASON.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.136
THEN I COULD WATCH
THE FOOTAGE THAT I WANTED.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.170
BUT IT'S EXPIRED.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.505

YOU COME TO ME

10:52.886 --> 10:54.252

MY HANDS DIRTY

10:54.254 --> 10:56.955

YOU DO, RIGHT?

11:02.896 --> 11:06.064
THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST
STORY OF YOUR LIFE, LEO.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.766
SO, YOU CAN STAY
ON THAT COUCH,

11:07.768 --> 11:09.300
OR YOU CAN TAKE YOUR
HEAD OUT YOUR ASS,

11:09.302 --> 11:12.837

AND MAYBE GET A PULITZER.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.441
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.377

DOES SOUND
MORE APPEALING.
