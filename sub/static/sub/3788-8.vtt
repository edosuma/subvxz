01:05.758 --> 01:07.385
Were you going to say goodbye?

01:07.493 --> 01:10.985
Yeah, I was going to call you tonight.
I swear.

01:12.431 --> 01:14.160
Should I come visit you in New York?

01:14.267 --> 01:15.859
Can you? That'd be great.

01:15.968 --> 01:17.993
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:26.078 --> 01:28.137
I gotta go. The guys are waiting.

01:29.348 --> 01:30.906
Give Philly a kiss for me.

01:31.083 --> 01:33.608
I can't believe you remembered
my dog's name.

01:34.186 --> 01:35.983
It's my favorite terrier.

01:39.091 --> 01:40.285
Let's hit it.

01:43.162 --> 01:47.121
E, remind me to call Charlotte, also.
She'll kill me if I don't say goodbye.

01:47.233 --> 01:49.133
- You should call Jamie, too.
- I know.

01:49.235 --> 01:50.930
Make a list so you don't forget anyone.

01:51.037 --> 01:53.005
- That's what I do.
- That's a good idea.

01:53.105 --> 01:55.073
- E, make me a list?
- Turtle, make a list.

01:55.174 --> 01:56.971
You know Vince can't read my handwriting.

01:57.076 --> 01:59.408
- God! You're useless.
- Says you.

01:59.512 --> 02:02.072
- Did you cancel the newspapers?
- You gotta tell me first.

02:02.181 --> 02:03.808
You gotta learn to anticipate, Turtle.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.042
There's a chain of command.

02:05.151 --> 02:07.346
I'm a soldier. I wait for orders.

02:07.453 --> 02:08.681
He's right.

02:08.821 --> 02:10.515
What happened to your delegation skills?

02:10.622 --> 02:13.854
You had 10 waiters underneath you.
Can't you handle one little Turtle?

02:13.960 --> 02:16.485
Instead of being an asshole,
you should be pissed at him.

02:16.595 --> 02:19.325
My life is too good
to be worried about shit like this.

02:19.432 --> 02:22.629
So where are we at
with Scarlett Johansson?

02:22.835 --> 02:25.167
- Where are we at?
- Yes. Where are we at?

02:25.271 --> 02:26.761
I told you to hook me up with her.

02:26.872 --> 02:28.203
I told you I don't know her.

02:28.307 --> 02:31.174
Find her. If I had your job,
it'd been done already.

02:31.277 --> 02:32.608
Scarlett Jo?

02:33.145 --> 02:36.546
I had a little
<i>Lost In Translation</i> moment myself...

02:36.649 --> 02:39.117
when I was doing
that TNT movie <i>Summerfall.</i>

02:39.385 --> 02:41.182
Isolated from the rest of the world...

02:41.287 --> 02:44.484
just me and this little beauty,
Lauren Jennings.

02:45.157 --> 02:46.590
They shot that movie in Pasadena.

02:46.692 --> 02:48.182
Yeah, but I didn't have a car.

02:48.294 --> 02:49.989
Back in the real world...

02:50.129 --> 02:52.063
Vince, are we gonna throw
a going-away party?

02:52.164 --> 02:53.825
Vince, we got to do something crazy.

02:53.933 --> 02:56.424
Wahlberg spent $500,000 on his bash...

02:56.535 --> 02:58.127
before he left for <i>The Italian Job.</i>

02:58.237 --> 03:00.000
Wahlberg made $10 million for that movie.

03:00.106 --> 03:02.472
Vince is making $60,000
before taxes and commissions.

03:02.575 --> 03:04.702
I don't understand
why you couldn't get me more.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.175
I don't make your deals, Vince.

03:06.278 --> 03:08.109
Can I run with this party, Vince?

03:08.214 --> 03:10.409
- E?
- I'm not running with it.

03:11.951 --> 03:14.112
Run, Turtle. Run.

03:15.087 --> 03:18.181
Who you gonna invite to the party, E?
Emily or Kristen?

03:18.391 --> 03:22.828
I say invite them both. Let them duke it out
in a steel-cage match, winner takes all.

03:23.329 --> 03:26.457
My money's on Kristen.
She'll knock the crap out of Emily.

03:26.565 --> 03:28.726
I don't know. I saw Emily at Tae-Bo.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.268
She was looking pretty feisty.
What do you think, E?

03:31.370 --> 03:32.894
I think you guys are assholes.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.495
Come on, man, it'd be hot.

03:34.673 --> 03:35.970
I like cute little Emily.

03:36.075 --> 03:38.100
- Then again, Kristen looks...
- Shut up, Drama.

03:38.210 --> 03:39.177
Jesus.

03:39.278 --> 03:41.678
Vince, who would you rather bang,
Kristen or Emily?

03:41.781 --> 03:42.748
Don't answer that, Vince.

03:42.848 --> 03:43.837
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

03:43.949 --> 03:45.746
I kinda like them both.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.216
E, you should feel good.

03:47.319 --> 03:49.981
Movie star Vince Chase
would bang both your broads.

03:50.089 --> 03:51.750
I do. I feel really blessed.

03:52.658 --> 03:55.422
Three months in New York.
What's wrong with that, right?

03:55.661 --> 03:57.891
It's not all it's cracked up to be, though.

03:57.997 --> 04:01.592
Running errands, sitting on the set,
getting coffee? I'm not into it.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.227
I put this fucking movie together.
I get treated like a glorified gofer.

04:05.905 --> 04:09.534
You know, when I went to the reunion,
people would come up to me and say:

04:10.042 --> 04:13.534
"So what are you doing?"
And I'd say, "I'm Vince's guy."

04:13.646 --> 04:15.671
Are you here to talk about business?

04:15.948 --> 04:17.916
No, I'm here to talk about us.

04:18.017 --> 04:19.575
It's kinda the same thing, right?

04:19.685 --> 04:22.449
No, not to me it isn't.
You know what your problem is?

04:23.122 --> 04:25.647
No, but I have a feeling you do. So tell me.

04:25.791 --> 04:27.691
You are addicted to Vince.

04:28.327 --> 04:30.955
Great. More textbook psychobabble.
Come on, let's hear it.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.894
When you're around him, you feel great.

04:32.998 --> 04:35.193
But when you're not,
you go through withdrawal...

04:35.301 --> 04:38.998
and you talk about quitting all the time.
Classic addiction symptoms.

04:39.138 --> 04:40.969
So, what, this is all my fault?

04:41.273 --> 04:44.140
No. I think you're both
fucked-up codependents.

04:45.277 --> 04:47.040
What about us? What are we?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.342
We're a couple.

04:50.649 --> 04:51.980
Maybe we're not.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.222
No, really, I'm just completely disgusted.

04:59.158 --> 05:02.491
You call me and say we're going
to go to the game on the 21st.

05:02.862 --> 05:05.592
I'm waiting for your phone call.
I call your office.

05:05.698 --> 05:08.223
I don't get a call back.
Then I turn on the TV...

05:08.334 --> 05:10.393
and I see you sitting next to Vin Diesel.

05:10.503 --> 05:13.028
- So what the hell is that?
- I told Emily to call you.

05:13.139 --> 05:16.131
She didn't call you. She fucked up.
My Blackberry was broken.

05:16.242 --> 05:18.676
Wait a second, I called her, okay?

05:18.811 --> 05:21.302
She gave you that message,
and you never called me back.

05:21.413 --> 05:25.110
I was gonna go to the game with you.
I told Emily that we were gonna be late.

05:25.217 --> 05:27.014
Okay? I went to go talk to Vin.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.519
He's got an 18-wheeler with equipment
and going crazy.

05:29.622 --> 05:30.919
They're making power shakes.

05:31.023 --> 05:32.650
He's got the fucking crazy glasses on.

05:32.758 --> 05:33.986
I don't know what's happening.

05:34.093 --> 05:36.721
- I told Emily to call you.
- What language are you talking?

05:36.829 --> 05:38.228
You thought... Is this an excuse?

05:38.330 --> 05:41.493
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- It's exactly what happened.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.625
I still don't know. You're talking Chinese.

05:43.736 --> 05:45.397
I'm not talking Chinese.

05:45.504 --> 05:47.529
Larry, how you doing?
Good to see you, pal.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.632
- Johnny Drama.
- Yeah. Remember me?

05:50.743 --> 05:52.370
- Yeah, how you doing?
- Hey, Ari.

05:52.478 --> 05:53.445
Hey.

05:53.612 --> 05:55.239
- This whole thing?
- You like that?

05:55.347 --> 05:57.247
- You don't like it?
- It's okay.

05:57.850 --> 06:00.250
- How's the show going? Good?
- Yeah.

06:00.753 --> 06:02.414
Any good parts in there?

06:05.124 --> 06:08.093
- Maybe.
- That's great.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.751
So, we will speak,
and I will take you to a game.

06:10.863 --> 06:12.558
- Okay. All right.
- All right?

06:14.166 --> 06:16.134
- Bye, Lar.
- Larry, let's talk.

06:17.269 --> 06:19.464
Don't ever fucking harass a real client again.

06:19.572 --> 06:20.834
I know the guy.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.338
Ari! Come on.

06:23.742 --> 06:25.539
There he is. Johnny!

06:27.947 --> 06:29.073
Sorry I'm late.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.615
- How you doing, you good?
- Yeah.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.311
Why don't you come back to the office?

06:34.520 --> 06:36.317
Just tell me the deal's done.

06:36.422 --> 06:39.721
Basically, they don't have enough money
to pay for your flight.

06:39.825 --> 06:41.053
Or your room.

06:42.194 --> 06:43.286
Per diem?

06:45.030 --> 06:48.158
I know you're excited about this movie.
It's a good little part.

06:48.267 --> 06:49.859
But here's the thing.

06:49.969 --> 06:53.166
I got you an audition
for a guest-starring role in a pilot.

06:54.006 --> 06:57.134
- A pilot that's all but on the air.
- Yeah, what's it called?

06:57.243 --> 06:59.507
<i>CSI: Minneapolis.</i>

06:59.945 --> 07:00.969
Don Johnson...

07:01.080 --> 07:03.241
playing William Peterson,
playing David Caruso...

07:03.349 --> 07:04.543
playing the Gary Sinise role.

07:04.650 --> 07:05.947
Sounds great.

07:06.051 --> 07:09.612
It's like $10,000,
plus first-class airfare and expenses.

07:09.755 --> 07:12.280
- To Minneapolis.
- No, it shoots in Vancouver.

07:12.391 --> 07:15.053
Now, the dates conflict
with <i>Queens Boulevard...</i>

07:15.160 --> 07:16.752
and there's no flexibility.

07:16.862 --> 07:19.490
Shit. When it rains, it pours.

07:20.966 --> 07:22.991
Do you think I got a shot at this?

07:23.102 --> 07:24.569
You're Johnny Drama.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.165
You always got a shot.

07:26.639 --> 07:29.437
When I played that cokehead stoolie
on <i>Miami Vice...</i>

07:29.541 --> 07:33.602
I remember right after a take,
Don Johnson said, "Nice job, kid."

07:34.713 --> 07:37.307
- Or was it the black guy?
- What's the pay?

07:37.516 --> 07:39.108
A lot more than <i>Queens Boulevard.</i>

07:39.218 --> 07:41.948
Plus first-class accommodations,
fat per diem.

07:42.121 --> 07:43.315
That's a tough choice.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.549
What are you saying? No, it's not.

07:45.658 --> 07:49.992
Look, I'll tell you what. I'll put you up
in New York, and I'll double your per diem.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.620
My baby brother's
not putting me up anywhere.

07:52.798 --> 07:55.767
Come on, Drama. <i>New Jack City.</i>

07:55.901 --> 07:57.562
Room service, escorts.

07:57.970 --> 08:01.269
Everybody knows the best whores
in the country are in Vancouver.

08:01.373 --> 08:05.070
- Vancouver ain't the country.
- You know what I'm saying, jackass.

08:05.177 --> 08:07.111
There's no money to stay in a hotel, Turtle.

08:07.212 --> 08:08.236
What?

08:08.347 --> 08:10.542
I can't be bringing girls back
to my mom's house.

08:10.649 --> 08:14.141
- The walls are paper thin.
- You ain't making them scream anyway.

08:14.787 --> 08:16.482
What if I pay my own way?

08:16.722 --> 08:19.247
Yeah? How you gonna do that?
You gonna sell a kidney?

08:19.358 --> 08:22.418
The going-away party.
We can charge $10 a head to get in.

08:22.528 --> 08:25.429
- You wanna promote the going-away party?
- Interesting.

08:25.531 --> 08:28.466
Come on, Vince, I'll make us a boatload
of money, all right?

08:28.567 --> 08:30.296
You get 10% of the door...

08:30.469 --> 08:33.461
and a prime table surrounded
by all the hotties in L.A.

08:33.572 --> 08:36.735
- All you got to do is just smile.
- He doesn't need 10% of the door.

08:36.842 --> 08:39.174
Yes, he does,
after you got him the shitty deal.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.640
I told you, I didn't make his fucking deal.

08:42.780 --> 08:44.476
Vince, override this guy.

08:46.185 --> 08:48.653
E, come on. It's a party.

08:48.754 --> 08:52.053
It'll make Turtle feel good about himself
if he earns a little cash.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.091
Yes. It'll boost my self-esteem.

08:54.193 --> 08:55.888
What do you say?

08:56.161 --> 08:57.423
Yeah, whatever.

08:57.529 --> 08:59.019
Knock it out, Turtle.

08:59.631 --> 09:02.065
What's the movement
on Scarlett Johansson?

09:03.268 --> 09:05.361
You know what, Vince? I'm not your pimp.

09:05.471 --> 09:08.235
If you want Scarlett Johansson's number,
get it yourself.

09:11.410 --> 09:12.399
What did I say?

09:12.511 --> 09:14.274
Yo, mofos, check this out.

09:14.613 --> 09:15.602
Ready?

09:20.386 --> 09:21.910
Tobey Maguire's house.

09:23.088 --> 09:24.521
Bang, Spidey!

09:28.494 --> 09:32.021
What's better, Taggert or Taggert?

09:32.464 --> 09:33.453
What?

09:33.999 --> 09:35.694
Taggert or Taggert?

09:36.468 --> 09:39.062
- The first one.
- Damn. Really?

09:39.204 --> 09:41.001
Yeah. Thanks a lot, man.

09:41.106 --> 09:42.198
No problem.

09:45.277 --> 09:46.744
<i>Viking Quest,</i> right?

09:47.045 --> 09:48.376
Yeah, that's me.

09:48.480 --> 09:49.708
I knew it.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.916
Do you think I can get a signed picture
for my wall?

09:54.186 --> 09:56.245
- Yes.
- For an extra 1,000 invites.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.551
Why not? For Torvald, anything.

10:06.165 --> 10:09.896
Five minutes, that's all.
I'm just gonna say goodbye to her.

10:10.469 --> 10:11.993
Then you can cross her off the list.

10:12.104 --> 10:14.299
It never takes just five minutes with this girl.

10:14.406 --> 10:15.600
Five minutes.

10:18.110 --> 10:20.237
- Girls, what's happening?
- How you ladies doing?

10:20.345 --> 10:21.710
Big party Saturday night.

10:21.814 --> 10:24.180
Vince Chase is going out of town.
You gotta be there.

10:24.283 --> 10:25.307
You might have heard.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.645
Be there or be square.

10:26.752 --> 10:27.719
How you ladies doing?

10:27.820 --> 10:28.809
Off the hook.

10:28.921 --> 10:31.287
$10, but if you give me your phone number,
it's $5.

10:31.390 --> 10:33.881
It's gonna be a great party.
You don't wanna miss that.

10:34.159 --> 10:35.524
Honey, how are ya?

10:36.462 --> 10:38.930
- They call this work?
- God bless America!

10:51.043 --> 10:53.409
I've never been with anyone
that can fuck this long.

10:53.512 --> 10:55.104
I've been training for this movie.

10:55.214 --> 10:58.012
It's gonna be a great fucking movie.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.821
I've been sitting here for 45 minutes
while he's getting laid.

11:04.923 --> 11:07.221
Then you're an idiot. You should leave.

11:07.326 --> 11:09.419
- It's not Scarlett Johansson?
- No.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.728
God, he's so disrespectful.

11:11.830 --> 11:13.889
No. He's sick. He's codependent.

11:13.999 --> 11:16.263
Why do you think
he never got his driver's license?

11:16.368 --> 11:18.962
Fuck it. I'm leaving. Bullshit.

11:19.771 --> 11:21.238
Yeah. Okay. Hold on.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.766
Shauna, it's Richard again.

11:22.875 --> 11:23.933
God!

11:24.443 --> 11:26.775
Richard, you are
a spindly, weaselly, prick queen...

11:26.879 --> 11:28.904
I swear, if you print that about Gary Busey...

11:29.014 --> 11:31.847
I'm gonna do everything
in my power to ruin your fucking life.

11:31.950 --> 11:34.384
- I'll see you back at the office, Christy.
- All right.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.351
And stay on top of that douche bag.

11:36.455 --> 11:37.513
Yeah.

11:39.925 --> 11:40.892
Asshole.

11:43.061 --> 11:44.756
What the fuck is this now?

11:47.032 --> 11:48.021
God!

11:48.967 --> 11:50.457
Shauna, I agree.

11:50.569 --> 11:51.695
Bon voyage?

11:51.803 --> 11:54.636
It sounds like you're shipping
a gay French couple off to sea.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.071
I didn't know anything about it.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.141
This is so low rent.

11:57.242 --> 11:59.767
You could've used bonded paper
and an approved photo.

11:59.878 --> 12:01.812
It looks like an audition for <i>American Idol.</i>

12:01.914 --> 12:05.441
<i>Eric, you should know better.</i>
<i>Use your fucking directional!</i>

12:05.584 --> 12:07.415
<i>God damn it! These people driving here.</i>

12:07.519 --> 12:10.352
<i>Vincent doesn't need his name</i>
<i>associated with nightclub promoting.</i>

12:10.455 --> 12:12.616
God forbid, there's a Happy Land fire
in there...

12:12.724 --> 12:14.282
like that Great White concert
in Rhode Island...

12:14.393 --> 12:16.588
we're fucked. Get your house in order, Eric.

12:17.829 --> 12:18.955
Jesus.

12:20.165 --> 12:21.757
Who says it's my house?

12:34.012 --> 12:36.344
I just had Shauna rip me a new asshole.

12:36.481 --> 12:39.041
You don't have to take shit from her.
She's a publicist.

12:39.151 --> 12:43.884
Jerk-off, you plaster cheap crappy fliers
with Vince's picture all over town.

12:43.989 --> 12:45.320
That wasn't cheap.

12:45.424 --> 12:48.018
I paid half price, and it was still expensive.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.650
So you go behind my fucking back?

12:49.761 --> 12:51.456
I didn't go behind your back.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.861
You wanted nothing to do with this.
I did it myself.

12:54.366 --> 12:56.664
You were too busy getting Vince
to do a movie...

12:56.768 --> 12:58.030
that's gonna leave us homeless.

12:58.136 --> 12:59.831
This movie's gonna make Vince's career.

12:59.938 --> 13:02.168
It better. Or else we're all fucked.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.504
Maybe we're fucked anyway.

13:06.812 --> 13:09.178
Come on, Turtle. Let's go get this thing.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.541
Knock them dead there, Drama.
Good luck, buddy.

13:11.650 --> 13:12.981
Thanks. Come on.

13:14.820 --> 13:16.117
Look at you.

13:16.221 --> 13:18.553
How you doing, baby?
I'm gonna nail this thing.

13:18.657 --> 13:20.454
- Go get them, Johnny.
- All right.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.691
What the fuck, E, you left me!

13:24.830 --> 13:28.596
Luckily, look who I bumped into
driving down Wilshire.

13:29.801 --> 13:31.291
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey, Janeen.

13:31.403 --> 13:34.634
Janeen was sweet enough to give me a ride
after you ditched me.

13:34.740 --> 13:36.435
Why did you do that to Vince, Eric?

13:37.309 --> 13:39.368
Yeah, E, why?

13:40.445 --> 13:41.503
Why?

13:42.914 --> 13:44.006
Long story.

13:46.118 --> 13:48.985
- You want a drink, babe?
- You got any juice boxes?

13:50.389 --> 13:53.552
You should've seen him coming down
Wilshire Blvd. All alone.

13:53.659 --> 13:55.286
He looked so cute.

13:56.094 --> 13:57.288
Are you okay?

13:57.796 --> 14:01.027
I'm a little shaken up. But I think I'll be okay.

14:01.233 --> 14:02.860
I can't believe you're leaving.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.629
I'm just going for a couple months.

14:05.170 --> 14:06.159
Yeah?

14:15.647 --> 14:18.115
Vince, we gotta be at Ari's in 20 minutes.

14:18.316 --> 14:19.806
Can you cover for me?

14:20.052 --> 14:22.953
- We're gonna have a Jacuz.
- We gotta go over these deal points.

14:23.121 --> 14:25.589
Could you get me some more money
on that, please?

14:25.691 --> 14:28.455
- What if they want you to sign something?
- Come on, E.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.723
Who forges my signature better than you?
Shall we?

14:34.800 --> 14:35.926
Be nice to Vince.

14:36.034 --> 14:37.467
Yeah. Thanks.

14:39.137 --> 14:41.264
Taggert! We meet again.

14:43.075 --> 14:46.044
For you, maybe.
I always relish our encounters.

14:47.512 --> 14:50.640
No, Taggert.
I'm afraid it's your time that's up!

14:55.921 --> 14:57.388
I just crushed that.

15:10.168 --> 15:11.499
Pizza boy's here.

15:13.472 --> 15:14.439
Really?

15:15.407 --> 15:16.465
Really.

15:24.816 --> 15:25.805
What's wrong with her?

15:25.917 --> 15:28.943
Ask my permission before you bang
one of my assistants.

15:29.321 --> 15:31.186
- How'd you know that?
- 'Cause I know all.

15:31.289 --> 15:33.655
I could've told you this would end badly.

15:33.825 --> 15:35.793
I gotta fire her so you don't feel weird.

15:35.894 --> 15:36.883
Don't fire her.

15:36.995 --> 15:39.429
I'll just sexually harass her until she quits.

15:39.531 --> 15:41.362
- Where's Vinny?
- He sent me.

15:42.334 --> 15:45.098
As long as I'm here, I want to talk.

15:45.504 --> 15:46.471
Yeah?

15:46.571 --> 15:47.902
About management.

15:50.976 --> 15:53.570
There you go, baby. All right!

15:53.779 --> 15:56.839
Come here. Let's hug it out, you little bitch!
I love it.

15:56.948 --> 15:59.746
Step aside and let a professional take over.
That's fantastic.

15:59.851 --> 16:01.876
Let's call Jimmy Miller. Let's get leverage.

16:01.987 --> 16:03.716
360, Handprint. Any one of these.

16:03.822 --> 16:05.517
Ari, I'm talking about me.

16:06.925 --> 16:10.292
I thought you already were his manager.
Because, believe me...

16:10.695 --> 16:13.755
I would not put up with this much shit
from anyone who wasn't.

16:13.865 --> 16:16.356
I know I am. But I want to do it for real.

16:16.568 --> 16:19.002
I wanna have the conversation. Lock it in.

16:19.104 --> 16:20.503
You come to me for advice?

16:20.605 --> 16:23.301
I'm gonna fucking cry.
All right, here's what you do.

16:23.408 --> 16:25.842
You deal with talent
the same way you deal with women.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.434
You have to make them believe...

16:27.546 --> 16:29.173
they need you more than you need them.

16:29.281 --> 16:30.248
He doesn't need me much.

16:30.348 --> 16:32.077
Of course not. You're fucking worthless.

16:32.184 --> 16:34.175
I could get a million morons to do the job.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.117
- That's not the point.
- What is the point?

16:36.221 --> 16:38.519
The point is that he is an insecure fuck...

16:38.623 --> 16:41.888
like all beautiful but handed-everything-
on-a-silver platter people.

16:41.993 --> 16:44.052
He doesn't trust anyone
in this world but you.

16:44.162 --> 16:46.630
You've been born into royalty, baby.
You know that.

16:46.731 --> 16:49.495
Now you just gotta be thankful
and wear the crown.

16:49.601 --> 16:52.900
As much as I appreciate it,
I didn't come here to ask for your advice.

16:53.004 --> 16:54.972
I came to ask for your support.

16:57.943 --> 16:59.740
- Do I have a choice? No, I don't.
- No.

17:01.079 --> 17:02.808
You got 1,000%.

17:03.114 --> 17:06.277
Here's a little indie script, $60,000.
Big payday.

17:06.417 --> 17:07.510
- Thanks.
- This is great.

17:07.618 --> 17:09.609
What's next?
You get a uniform and a mustache?

17:09.721 --> 17:10.915
I don't have health insurance.

17:11.021 --> 17:13.923
- But I bet you had it over at Quiznos.
- Sbarros.

17:14.025 --> 17:16.492
- And I had a business card.
- There you go.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.429
What am I supposed to say to Emily
when I walk out?

17:19.531 --> 17:21.464
Pretend you're on the phone.
You're focused.

17:21.566 --> 17:23.124
You can't talk to her.

17:23.868 --> 17:25.859
Let's try to get that immediately if we can.

17:25.971 --> 17:27.199
See you later.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.204
Johnny Chase?

17:33.845 --> 17:35.107
Represent, bro.

17:38.817 --> 17:41.377
- Sheila, how are ya?
- Hi, good. How are you?

17:42.787 --> 17:44.049
- Hello.
- There he is.

17:44.155 --> 17:46.316
- Thanks for having me.
- How ya doing?

17:47.192 --> 17:50.457
- You look familiar.
- You auditioned for me a couple years ago.

17:51.396 --> 17:52.727
How did that go?

17:53.531 --> 17:55.396
- You know.
- You can't work them all.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.963
All right. Any notes, any thoughts,
anything I should know?

17:59.070 --> 18:01.061
No, just give it a shot. We'll go from there.

18:01.172 --> 18:03.140
I could do this a million different ways.

18:03.241 --> 18:06.574
Why don't you try it just one way?
Make a choice and give it a shot.

18:06.678 --> 18:07.872
Stick to it.

18:14.519 --> 18:17.852
Hooga! One time, baby. Come on.

18:23.862 --> 18:26.387
Taggert, we meet again.

18:26.831 --> 18:28.799
And that's one time too many.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.364
For you, maybe.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.137
I always relish these moments.

18:34.239 --> 18:35.900
Your time is up, Conlon.

18:36.308 --> 18:37.502
No, Taggert.

18:39.945 --> 18:42.175
I'm afraid it's your time that's up.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.515
Come on, man.

18:46.084 --> 18:49.076
A little respect. Yo, back there.

18:49.220 --> 18:51.313
I'm acting here. A little respect?

18:51.856 --> 18:53.118
I mean, please.

18:53.491 --> 18:54.480
Important e-mail.

18:54.592 --> 18:57.288
I've been working on this thing all day.
This is important.

18:57.395 --> 18:58.657
John, don't let it throw you.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.822
- Just ignore him.
- Focus.

19:00.932 --> 19:03.423
Fuck that, man! Tell this guy to focus.

19:03.535 --> 19:05.435
Johnny, thank you for coming in.

19:05.537 --> 19:07.027
- Appreciate it.
- Bye.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.672
- Great job.
- Thank you.

19:10.775 --> 19:13.266
You know what? Fuck you!

19:16.848 --> 19:18.110
Shit.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.347
I don't know. I thought he was great.

19:21.486 --> 19:24.114
Fuck TV!
Let's go to New York and make a movie!

19:24.222 --> 19:28.215
- There you go, baby.
- Can I stay with your mother?

19:29.127 --> 19:30.219
I remember.

19:31.162 --> 19:33.027
Of course you can bring her.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.524
Yeah?

19:39.804 --> 19:42.170
Hopefully I'll see you in the Hamptons.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.931
Labor Day. I can't wait. Bye.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.109
I think that's the last one.

19:49.547 --> 19:52.573
- So, what are you doing for dinner tonight?
- What?

19:52.751 --> 19:54.719
We should go to dinner before the party.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.582
I want to talk to you about some stuff.

19:56.688 --> 19:58.952
Some stuff? What do you mean?
Sounds weird.

19:59.290 --> 20:00.723
It's nothing weird.

20:01.459 --> 20:04.587
E, you're not coming out of the closet,
are you?

20:05.563 --> 20:07.622
'Cause you know I like long legs.

20:08.266 --> 20:10.291
I want to talk to you
about being your manager.

20:10.402 --> 20:11.835
As opposed to what?

20:12.337 --> 20:14.999
As opposed to nothing,
which is what I am now.

20:19.310 --> 20:21.335
Kristen's been fucking with your head again.

20:21.446 --> 20:23.311
- No, she has not.
- Come on, E.

20:23.515 --> 20:26.541
Admit it. You guys have a very
dysfunctional relationship.

20:26.651 --> 20:29.347
Every time you come from her,
you sound like her.

20:29.454 --> 20:32.389
- Maybe she should be my manager.
- All right, fuck dinner.

20:32.490 --> 20:33.514
Relax, E.

20:33.792 --> 20:37.319
I wanted to go to dinner
and talk about this stuff there.

20:37.429 --> 20:38.953
You're making me talk about it here.

20:39.064 --> 20:41.123
And it's just not going right. Fuck dinner.

20:41.232 --> 20:44.599
Nothing's been said. Nobody said anything.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.260
Nothing's been talked about.

20:46.371 --> 20:49.101
You want to take me to dinner?
You wanna talk business?

20:49.207 --> 20:51.937
You want to woo me? Wine and dine me.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.234
All right.

20:54.179 --> 20:56.511
Let me pack up some things. We'll talk.

21:05.023 --> 21:07.116
- Who's buying?
- I'm buying.

21:07.525 --> 21:09.049
With my credit card that I pay the bill on.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.855
I'm doing this real. This is no bullshit.

21:10.962 --> 21:13.294
Great. Now I know what I'm gonna order.

21:14.933 --> 21:16.400
Lanie!

21:16.534 --> 21:19.594
- Did I hear you're going out of town?
- I'm leaving tonight.

21:19.704 --> 21:21.638
I can't believe
you didn't say goodbye to me.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.934
Why do you think I'm here?
I'm saying goodbye now.

21:24.042 --> 21:25.339
Listen.

21:25.443 --> 21:27.536
You remember that
really good bottle of wine...

21:27.645 --> 21:28.737
that I got here with Ridley?

21:28.847 --> 21:31.281
- Yeah, '82 Margaux.
- Yeah, that's the one.

21:31.516 --> 21:33.416
We're gonna have two of those.

21:34.452 --> 21:36.044
You must be important.

21:37.522 --> 21:38.580
We'll see.

21:40.792 --> 21:41.759
Before l...

21:41.860 --> 21:44.658
Can we hold off a couple seconds
before we get into business?

21:44.896 --> 21:46.363
My boys just showed.

21:49.734 --> 21:52.168
- What up, player?
- Yo!

21:55.006 --> 21:56.098
I'm hungry.

21:56.774 --> 21:59.334
You want this real.
This is how I did it with Ari.

21:59.444 --> 22:02.379
- What are you gonna do for us?
- Yeah?

22:02.480 --> 22:04.004
I've been doing this job for a year.

22:04.115 --> 22:07.812
- I don't need to put up with this bullshit.
- E, you're really wooing me.

22:07.919 --> 22:11.286
- E never was a real people person.
- That's gonna have to change...

22:11.389 --> 22:13.516
if you want to be involved
in talent management.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.786
Now, I'm pissed. What's your answer?

22:17.729 --> 22:19.390
What's your sales pitch?

22:24.769 --> 22:26.031
All right, Vince.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.832
I picked your last movie.

22:28.173 --> 22:30.698
I put you in this new movie. I know you.

22:30.875 --> 22:33.469
I know your strengths.
I know your weaknesses.

22:33.945 --> 22:37.176
- Yeah, you do have a few.
- Vince ain't got no weaknesses.

22:37.749 --> 22:38.909
That's a double negative.

22:39.017 --> 22:40.780
You just said he's got weaknesses.

22:40.885 --> 22:43.376
I'm starting to see how this business works.

22:44.289 --> 22:47.053
I feel like I'm starting
to learn how to work it.

22:47.258 --> 22:49.385
How many times
have we heard that one, Vince?

22:49.494 --> 22:50.483
Shut the fuck up, Turtle.

22:50.595 --> 22:53.723
Vince, take your time.
Don't rush into anything.

22:54.265 --> 22:56.927
You guys are right.
I gotta think about things.

22:57.402 --> 22:59.768
- I like the way things are.
- I don't.

23:01.306 --> 23:03.467
E, you know I don't like change.

23:03.575 --> 23:04.940
I'm not going to New York.

23:05.043 --> 23:06.374
- Really?
- Really.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.273
I guess you gotta do what you gotta do.

23:11.382 --> 23:14.351
Fuck you, all right?
You asked me to move out here.

23:14.452 --> 23:16.818
Don't forget that. Here you go, asshole.

23:17.555 --> 23:19.989
You're still going
to the going-away party, right?

23:20.091 --> 23:21.422
Shut up, Turtle.

23:28.399 --> 23:30.959
I can't believe he's not coming.
How can he not come?

23:31.069 --> 23:33.037
I knew this Kristen thing
was gonna backfire.

23:33.137 --> 23:35.469
We should've made Emily work.
She was a career girl.

23:35.573 --> 23:36.540
No.

23:37.141 --> 23:40.633
He said Kristen had nothing to do with it.
It was his own stupid decision.

23:41.546 --> 23:43.639
You made the stupid decision, bro.

23:44.282 --> 23:46.648
- What?
- Yeah. You ain't that easy.

23:47.518 --> 23:51.682
You think you're going to find someone
you like that could tolerate you 24l7?

23:51.856 --> 23:53.983
I love you, bro. But I ain't doing it.

23:54.092 --> 23:55.116
I could do it.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.921
Yes. That's a good option.

24:08.072 --> 24:09.334
Let's go party.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.931
Fuck that! I'm not going in there.

24:12.110 --> 24:13.873
- Come on. One beer.
- No. Come on.

24:13.978 --> 24:16.344
Let's get blasted on the plane.
Just the three of us.

24:16.447 --> 24:20.144
Fine by me. But I just gotta go in there first
and handle a little business.

24:24.289 --> 24:27.315
- Is that Vincent Chase in there?
- No. Vince is inside.

24:27.458 --> 24:29.289
He just called me. I gotta go see him now.

24:29.394 --> 24:30.725
Come in, though.

24:33.564 --> 24:35.259
Yo, let me use your phone.

24:48.179 --> 24:49.168
Hello?

24:50.748 --> 24:52.079
This is awkward.

24:52.684 --> 24:54.549
I forgot my wallet.

24:55.353 --> 24:56.877
Come on, Vince. Fuck you.

24:56.988 --> 24:59.513
Seriously, it's somewhere
on the coffee table.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.023
<i>Come on. What do you say?</i>

25:01.125 --> 25:03.559
<i>I'd get it myself,</i>
<i>but I gotta go all the way there...</i>

25:03.661 --> 25:05.595
and all the way back. It just seems stupid.

25:05.697 --> 25:07.392
What do you say? Come on.

25:08.866 --> 25:10.766
Okay. I'll be there.

25:10.968 --> 25:11.957
Thanks.

25:14.172 --> 25:15.605
You're an asshole.

25:18.376 --> 25:21.243
Excuse me, guys. Sorry. Have a good night.

25:22.180 --> 25:25.047
You two, go get some drinks in there.
It's crazy.

25:26.918 --> 25:30.854
- Cha-ching!
- Yeah.

25:31.122 --> 25:34.319
My mother would rather be dead
than have you stay with us.

25:34.959 --> 25:36.085
Sweet.

26:28.646 --> 26:31.706
Only a real asshole would spend $30,000
on a flight...

26:31.816 --> 26:33.807
when the whole job's
only paying him $60,000.

26:33.918 --> 26:35.249
It's worth it.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.480
How else are we gonna bring
the Sherpa weed and the dog?

26:39.457 --> 26:41.118
You're still an asshole.

26:41.659 --> 26:43.854
- Here's your wallet.
- Thanks.

27:42.887 --> 27:47.119
You're telling me
you're willing to fuck up our friendship...

27:47.725 --> 27:50.694
'cause if this doesn't work out,
there's no turning back.

27:50.795 --> 27:52.626
My best friend, I can't fire.

27:53.164 --> 27:55.997
But my manager, he's replaceable.

27:56.267 --> 27:58.428
That's a chance I'm willing to take.

28:02.006 --> 28:04.873
Yeah, at 5% of me, I'd take that chance, too.

28:04.976 --> 28:06.000
10%.

28:06.511 --> 28:08.069
Plus health insurance.

28:08.980 --> 28:09.969
Hello?

28:10.181 --> 28:12.012
Who is that? Kristen? Let me talk to her.

28:12.116 --> 28:13.549
I wanna settle this whole thing.

28:13.651 --> 28:14.743
Hold on a second.

28:14.852 --> 28:17.685
Thanks for calling me back,
I really appreciate it.

28:19.223 --> 28:20.212
Hello?

28:20.324 --> 28:23.418
Hi, Vince. It's Scarlett. Is this a bad time?

28:24.428 --> 28:27.761
Scarlett! How are you?

28:29.233 --> 28:30.461
Where are you?

28:30.701 --> 28:32.498
I'm in New York, I just got in.

28:32.603 --> 28:36.699
Really? I'm on my way
to New York right now.

28:37.708 --> 28:39.608
You wanna grab a late dinner?

28:42.513 --> 28:44.242
Let's make it an early breakfast.

28:44.348 --> 28:46.509
I tell you what. I'll call you when I land.

28:46.617 --> 28:48.312
Okay. Cool.

28:49.020 --> 28:51.215
- Talk to you later.
- See you later.

28:52.790 --> 28:54.781
- Nice.
- That's what I do.

28:56.127 --> 28:57.458
Get on the plane.

28:57.895 --> 28:59.055
What about my car?

28:59.163 --> 29:01.961
Your car?
You want me to buy you a new car?

29:02.199 --> 29:04.690
- No, I like my car.
- Get the fuck out of here.

29:04.802 --> 29:05.769
Leave it.

29:05.870 --> 29:09.067
I can't have my manager driving around
in a piece of shit like that.

29:11.609 --> 29:13.338
You going somewhere?
