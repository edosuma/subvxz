WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.434
You seen commercials for
indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC.

00:03.600 --> 00:04.794
Tagamet HB?

00:04.960 --> 00:06.439
Country's sick to their stomachs.

00:06.600 --> 00:09.558
You know you're supposed to take
these things before you get sick?

00:09.720 --> 00:11.392
- What is this, a bit?
- No.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.915
- Because I'm not in the mood.
- We're just talking.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.196
Is this not the greatest
marketing ploy ever?

00:16.360 --> 00:18.271
If you feel good,
you're supposed to take one.

00:18.440 --> 00:19.793
I know that tone. This is a bit.

00:19.960 --> 00:23.077
They've opened a whole new market.
Medication for the well.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.073
All right. Are you done
with your little amusement?

00:26.240 --> 00:27.673
Then you admit it was amusing?

00:27.840 --> 00:30.673
It was okay. But move the
"medication for the well" to the front...

00:30.840 --> 00:32.319
...and hit the word "good" harder.

00:32.479 --> 00:34.277
Great. Thanks.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.998
So your firm designed
all the furniture in here?

00:43.160 --> 00:44.991
Well, we manufacture it.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.196
The original designs
are by Karl Farbman.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.112
Oh, Farbman.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.953
- Do you know Farbman?
- Love Farbman.

00:52.240 --> 00:55.232
Most people go their whole lives
without sitting in a Farbman.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.630
Well, if you call that living.

01:00.920 --> 01:03.878
Wouldn't it be great if
Farbman designed shoes?

01:04.040 --> 01:07.794
Brett? Don't you think
that would be great? Brett?

01:07.960 --> 01:09.996
After the song, babe.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.918
This song.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.598
So when do I meet this jerk?

01:19.760 --> 01:22.991
He's not a jerk, Jer.
He only works with Karl Farbman.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.116
- Who?
- I don't know. Some designer.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.669
Anyway, Brett
is so generous and sensitive.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.035
Last night he was moved
just listening to a song.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.599
- What song?
- "Desperado."

01:31.760 --> 01:33.637
"Desperado"?
And you're still dating him?

01:33.800 --> 01:35.677
I'll tell you who sounds
a little desperado.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.031
See that salesman
twirling that umbrella?

01:39.200 --> 01:41.794
- I invented that.
- That had to be invented?

01:41.960 --> 01:44.076
When I started out as a comedian,
I sold umbrellas.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.676
It was my idea to twirl it
to attract customers.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.469
Oh, really? Well, why don't
we ask him about it?

01:51.880 --> 01:53.871
- Elaine.
- Excuse me.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.393
Hey, how you doing?

01:55.560 --> 01:59.439
My friend here says that he invented
that little twirl you're doing.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.068
Elaine, please,
it was a long time ago.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.992
The man doesn't want
a history lesson.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.037
Teddy Padilac
came up with this twirl.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.193
I know Teddy Padilac.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.590
I worked with him on 48th and Sixth.

02:10.759 --> 02:12.193
That's where he come up with it.

02:12.360 --> 02:15.079
- In his dreams.
- All right. Can we go?

02:15.240 --> 02:18.949
By the way, you're doing it too fast.
You'll disorient the customers.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.758
It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.431
I find it disorienting.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.079
Who buys an umbrella anyway?

02:29.240 --> 02:32.437
You can get them for free
in the coffee shop in the metal cans.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.750
Those belong to people.

02:38.200 --> 02:42.113
Hey. Well, this was
downstairs for you.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.838
Oh, no, not more checks.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.070
They're coming in faster
than I can sign them.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.719
- What checks?
- Oh, you didn't hear?

02:47.880 --> 02:49.677
Jerry's a big star in Japan.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.518
Don't know why.
There's a clip of me...

02:51.680 --> 02:54.148
...in the credits of some
Japanese comedy.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.470
Yeah, The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

02:57.480 --> 03:00.392
They run it all the time. I'm starting
to get these royalty checks.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.272
Look at all of those. You're rich.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.158
No, each one is for like 12 cents.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.754
It's barely worth the pain
in my hand to sign them.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.238
Jerry, you need any new furniture?

03:15.400 --> 03:17.152
- Why?
- Elaine's new boyfriend, you know...

03:17.320 --> 03:19.436
...he's giving me
this oversized chest of drawers.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.636
- It's a Farbman.
- He's giving you furniture?

03:21.800 --> 03:24.473
- Who is this guy?
- Who are any of her losers?

03:24.640 --> 03:26.358
You're on that list.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.958
I gotta go home and open up
the house for the carpet cleaners.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.111
You know, they're doing
my whole place for $25?

03:32.280 --> 03:35.158
Oh, no, no, no.
Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?

03:35.320 --> 03:37.914
- Yeah. You heard of them?
- They're a crazy religious cult.

03:38.080 --> 03:41.755
The carpet cleaning is just a means
for them to get into your apartment.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.117
So? For a $25 cleaning, I can listen
to some pointless blather.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.589
I do it. I'm not even
getting the cleaning.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.910
I signed over 100 checks
this morning.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.719
- Hello, $12.
- Excuse me.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.518
Would you take a picture, please.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.318
Oh, yeah. Sure.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.432
I'm gonna ask this guy something.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.155
Hey, nice twirl you got there.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.038
You know who invented that,
don't you?

04:08.200 --> 04:10.156
- Hey, are you folks from Japan?
- Yes.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.952
You recognize that mug?

04:12.120 --> 04:13.792
That's the funny face
that greets you...

04:13.960 --> 04:16.190
...at the beginning of
The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.793
- Oh, Super Terrific!
- Yeah.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.757
Yeah, huh? Yeah, that's him.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.428
What is he doing?

04:22.800 --> 04:25.792
Well, I don't know,
but something super-terrific, I'm sure.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.757
- That's funny.
- Oh, yeah, very funny.

04:27.920 --> 04:31.196
And it wouldn't be impolite
to laugh at his antics.

04:33.080 --> 04:36.356
Yeah, that's it. Because everybody
laughs at Jerry here in America.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.313
We're pretty much finished.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.634
There's just one more thing.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.711
Here it comes.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.748
You forgot to sign your check.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.073
Sorry.

04:57.320 --> 05:01.393
You sure there isn't anything else?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.558
No.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.631
So that's it?

05:06.800 --> 05:10.315
- Unless you need a receipt.
- I wish that was all I needed.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.754
Life can be so confusing.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.717
I'm searching
for answers anywhere.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.552
Good luck with that.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.837
Hey.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.754
- What's with the claw?
- Super-terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.389
- There's no sign of Kramer.
- Oh, Brett.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.232
- This is Jerry.
- Hi.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.513
That's very funny. Elaine told me
you're some kind of comedian.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.511
I'm one kind.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.709
Have you seen the chest of drawers
Brett gave to Kramer?

05:39.880 --> 05:42.189
- Fleckman. Right.
- Farbman.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.479
- You gotta see them. They're beautiful.
- I'm sure they are.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.473
I'd be happy to get you some,
if that's what you're driving at.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.117
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Don't worry. It's no charge to you.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.556
Looks like what you really need is
a decent desk for writing your skits.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.119
I don't write skits.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.714
Of course you don't.
You don't have a proper workstation.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.393
I'll fax over my catalogue.

06:02.440 --> 06:07.389
Brett, Jerry doesn't have
a fax machine.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.151
I'm sure things will pick up
for you soon.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.358
Elaine, maybe we should get going.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.715
- Wanna join us?
- Where you going, the coffee shop?

06:17.880 --> 06:21.236
The coffee shop? I think we can
do a little better than that.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.358
You look like you could use
a solid meal at a real restaurant.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.553
- You look like you could use a...
- Jerry.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.954
Three hundred dollars. Mr. Oh, how
much would these run you in Tokyo?

06:35.280 --> 06:37.077
Those are 30,000 yen.

06:37.240 --> 06:39.037
Thirty thousand?

06:39.200 --> 06:41.555
Well, these are practically free.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.431
Giddy up. You're a cowboy now.

06:47.960 --> 06:49.951
I feel terrible about
your friend Jerry.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.350
He's upset that I gave Kramer
that chest of drawers.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.873
Why do you think he's upset?

06:54.040 --> 06:57.191
Well, how could he not be? Living in
that cramped little apartment...

06:57.360 --> 07:01.399
...that outdated furniture,
so terribly un-Karl-Farbman-like.

07:01.560 --> 07:05.633
We're not gonna talk about
Karl Farbman all night, are we?

07:05.800 --> 07:07.358
I hope not.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.953
Brett, is everything all right?

07:14.560 --> 07:16.118
What is it?
Is there someone outside?

07:16.480 --> 07:17.799
Elaine, the song.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.950
For a minute, I thought
it was that urban legend...

07:24.120 --> 07:26.111
...about the guy with the hook
hanging on the...

07:26.280 --> 07:28.953
Elaine, could you just not talk
for one minute?

07:30.080 --> 07:31.559
Sorry.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.998
- No spiel?
- Not a peep.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.912
They just cleaned the carpets
and left.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.036
They call themselves a cult.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.199
So you're angry
that this bizarre carpet cabal...

07:46.360 --> 07:47.793
...made no attempt to abduct you?

07:47.960 --> 07:49.632
They could have at least tried.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.594
Maybe they thought you looked
too smart to be brainwashed.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.398
- Please.
- Too dumb?

07:56.360 --> 08:00.672
Well, Mackie's back in town.
Nice duds.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.431
Yeah, it's a gift
from my Japanese friends.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.238
They're known as gift-givers.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.960
And tonight, we're going dancing
at the Rainbow Room.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.476
Sounds like you're throwing
their money around.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.596
Well, Jerry, they're Japanese.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.035
I mean, that TV you watch,
that sushi you eat...

08:15.200 --> 08:16.519
...even that kimono you wear...

08:16.680 --> 08:18.875
...where do you think
all that money goes?

08:19.240 --> 08:20.958
That's right.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.553
How'd you hook up with
these guys?

08:22.720 --> 08:25.188
They recognized Jerry from
The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.396
See, you should be doing
your own show in Japan.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.754
Now, they get you.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.638
What kind of show am I gonna do
in Japan?

08:30.800 --> 08:32.597
What did you do with
that pilot you did?

08:32.760 --> 08:34.591
Yeah, the pilot.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.591
Right. That had
marvellous production values.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.671
I do a lot of business with
Japanese TV.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.636
They broadcast
a lot of American baseball.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.438
They got an office here
in New York.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.319
Forget it. The pilot was awful.
It failed.

08:45.480 --> 08:48.040
It failed here. Because here
every time you turn on a TV...

08:48.200 --> 08:51.078
...all you see is four morons
sitting around an apartment...

08:51.240 --> 08:52.673
...whining about their dates.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.957
See, George is right, Jerry.
See, here you're just another apple.

08:56.120 --> 09:01.319
But in Japan, you're an exotic fruit,
like an orange, which is rare there.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.434
You had a date?

09:06.600 --> 09:09.831
You went out with my butler? Who
said you could go out with my butler?

09:10.000 --> 09:13.788
- Why do I need your permission?
- Because he's my butler.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.631
So, what do you think?

09:20.800 --> 09:22.791
We're a bit confused.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.952
Why was this man Jerry's butler?

09:26.640 --> 09:29.279
You see, the man
who is the butler...

09:29.440 --> 09:32.352
...had gotten into
a car accident with Jerry.

09:32.520 --> 09:35.193
And because he didn't have
any insurance...

09:35.360 --> 09:39.478
...the judge decreed that
the man become Jerry's butler.

09:39.640 --> 09:42.074
Is this customary in
your legal system?

09:42.440 --> 09:46.274
No. That's what makes it
such a humorous situation.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.074

09:56.040 --> 10:00.352
I'm sorry. I'm sure Mr. Seinfeld is
very funny to Americans.

10:00.520 --> 10:04.991
But I'm not sure this butler show
would work in Japan.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.798
Oh, l... I disagree.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.872
You've... You've been living
in America too long.

10:10.040 --> 10:13.953
You've forgotten what it's like
to have no oranges.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.678
Sorry. My hand is numb.

10:20.840 --> 10:25.630
Yes, from endorsing checks for
The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.314
You must go.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.912
Well, I think
I'm on the outs with Brett.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.636
I got shushed during "Desperado."

10:38.400 --> 10:40.834
What does he listen to,
the all "Desperado" station?

10:41.480 --> 10:44.677
He is just in his own world
when he hears that song.

10:44.840 --> 10:49.436
It's like I'm sitting there in the car,
and he's out riding fences.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.716
You know, what you need is
a song you can share.

10:52.280 --> 10:56.159
Yeah, you're right.
We need to find our song.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.232
Okay. So is there any song
that you feel very strongly about?

11:02.120 --> 11:03.348
I like "Witchy Woman."

11:03.520 --> 11:06.114
- "Witchy Woman"?
- You know, "Witchy Woman."

11:09.000 --> 11:10.433
Oh, "Witchy Woman."

11:12.240 --> 11:13.434
- Hey, Elaine.
- Hey.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.158
Hey, how was the Rainbow Room?

11:15.320 --> 11:16.719
Well, we... We had to leave early.

11:16.880 --> 11:20.998
There was a slight monetary
discrepancy regarding the bill.

11:21.160 --> 11:23.879
- Listen, could I borrow some pillows?
- What for?

11:24.040 --> 11:26.759
Well, my Japanese friends
are gonna stay with me.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.990
I thought they all had suites
at the Plaza.

11:29.440 --> 11:33.956
Well, I'm sorry, Jerry. We all don't
have checks rolling in like you do.

11:34.120 --> 11:37.317
Well, what about all that money
from the kimonos I wear?

11:38.160 --> 11:39.513
Well, they ran out of it.

11:39.680 --> 11:43.389
I mean, Manhattan can be quite
pricey, even with 50,000 yen.

11:43.560 --> 11:47.030
Fifty thousand yen?
Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?

11:47.400 --> 11:49.038
Evidently.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.158
Oh, by the way, tell Brett that
his chest of drawers are a big hit.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.470
My guests are
very comfortable in them.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.358
In them?

11:58.520 --> 12:00.795
You have them sleeping in drawers?

12:01.000 --> 12:04.231
Jerry, have you ever seen
the business hotels in Tokyo?

12:04.400 --> 12:07.312
They sleep in tiny,
stacked cubicles all the time.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.358
- They feel right at home.
- This has international incident...

12:10.520 --> 12:12.829
...written all over it.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.998
- Good night, Mr. Tanaka.
- Good night.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.720
- Good night, Mr. Oh.
- Good night.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.835
Good night, Mr. Yamaguchi.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.230
- What is this?
- Rice Krispies.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.799
East meets West, Jerry.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.957
That's a lovely little
bureau-and-breakfast you're running.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.348
Well, I'm off to the bank.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.719
Elaine, l...

12:54.080 --> 12:55.479
What do you think?

12:57.200 --> 12:58.474
What are you doing?

12:58.640 --> 13:01.154
That's "Witchy Woman."
I thought it could be our song.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.678
"Witchy Woman" is okay for you,
but I've already got a song.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.071
Oh, well, then how about
"Desperado"?

13:07.240 --> 13:08.514
We can share it.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.109
No. It's mine.

13:15.080 --> 13:18.390
Here you go.
Snap, crackle and pop.

13:22.440 --> 13:26.194
Good morning, Mr. Oh.
I gotta make up the drawer.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.635
Come back in half-hour.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.873
- Hey, I'll take one.
- Well, look who's back.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.271
Teddy, this is the guy says
he invented the twirl.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.312
Jerry Seinfeld.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.710
Teddy Padilac, long time, no see.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.472
What do you got
in a push-button mini?

13:48.640 --> 13:51.632
Same thing we had when
you bailed on us 15 years ago.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.598
Bailed? Come on, you knew
I wanted to be a comedian.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.797
Besides, we had some good times.
Remember Tropical Storm Renee?

13:57.960 --> 14:01.032
Oh, yeah, sure. But where were you
during the poncho craze of '84?

14:01.200 --> 14:02.838
I almost lost my house.

14:03.480 --> 14:04.993
Umbrella, buddy?

14:05.160 --> 14:07.913
Now we got that damn
urban sombrero to contend with.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.274
Easy, Clicky.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.351
I hear you're taking credit
for the twirl.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.636
Oh, it's so many years ago.
Who cares?

14:13.800 --> 14:16.268
I care. Clicky cares.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.876
- Look, could I just buy an umbrella?
- Yeah, sure.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.792
- Two hundred dollars.
- What?

14:21.960 --> 14:24.520
Special price for a real
foul-weather friend.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.634
Hey, George. All right,
how about that tour, huh?

14:31.800 --> 14:33.631
These guys are ready to
run the bases.

14:33.800 --> 14:37.076
Kramer, it's... It's raining.
They got the tarp on the field.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.395
Listen, George, what else
can I do with these guys?

14:40.560 --> 14:42.676
Bear in mind,
they're a little light on the yen.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.435
Well, l... I got the pilot
of the Jerry show.

14:46.640 --> 14:49.108
That's perfect.
How would you guys like to watch...

14:49.280 --> 14:52.113
...the Super Terrific Happy star,
Jerry Seinfeld?

14:52.280 --> 14:54.430
But we are also very hungry.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.194
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, you guys
just watch the tape...

14:57.360 --> 14:58.873
...and I'll get you some food.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.871
- Go ahead. Yeah.
- Please.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.031
Hey, peanuts!

15:03.480 --> 15:05.471
George. George, got a minute?

15:05.680 --> 15:07.796
George, did you call some
carpet cleaners?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.070
- Are they here?
- They're in my office right now.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.515
- They haven't said anything to you?
- About what?

15:12.680 --> 15:15.069
What kind of a snobby,
stuck-up cult is this?

15:22.120 --> 15:25.271
- Hey, Jerry.
- Oh, hi, Brett.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.032
Haven't you ever
heard of an umbrella?

15:27.200 --> 15:28.838
I didn't have enough money.

15:29.320 --> 15:32.357
- Sure things will pick up for you.
- No, it's not that. It's...

15:34.320 --> 15:38.108
Oh, no. Look at the checks.
Hours of hard work ruined.

15:38.280 --> 15:41.317
Don't worry.
I can spot you the 12 cents.

15:41.480 --> 15:42.674
No. It's not the money.

15:42.840 --> 15:45.752
It's my hand.
It's crippled from writing and writing.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.478
Nothing's working for you, is it?

15:47.640 --> 15:49.073
Not at the moment, Brett.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.629
I'd give you a ride,
but I got Karl Farbman here.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.598
Thanks for stopping.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.312
Brett said you ran away from him
as if he were the boogity man?

15:59.480 --> 16:00.674
Bogeyman.

16:01.880 --> 16:04.030
- Boogie?
- I'm quite sure.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.396
Anyway, any luck
getting together on a song?

16:07.560 --> 16:10.120
No. He blew out my
"Witchy Woman."

16:10.280 --> 16:11.872
And he won't share "Desperado."

16:12.040 --> 16:13.871
Hey, what do you think of
"Oye Como Va"?

16:15.080 --> 16:17.753
Well, I'm running out of guys
here in this city, Jer.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.118
Hey, great news.

16:22.280 --> 16:25.636
I showed the pilot to Kramer's
Japanese friends. They loved it!

16:25.800 --> 16:27.677
Really? They bought
the butler character?

16:27.840 --> 16:30.434
Did I tell you that story's relatable?
That was a great show.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.636
That is why I'm bringing it
back to NBC.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.995
- NBC?
- Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.

16:37.480 --> 16:39.550
But they told us we must go now.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.154
Yeah, but now I have
my own market research.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.834
Actual Japanese viewers
that loved the show.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.309
- I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
- Hey, George, do me a favour.

16:47.480 --> 16:50.597
If they make you an offer,
whatever it is, just take it.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.310
Hey, by the way
what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?

16:56.480 --> 16:58.038
- Who?
- The network executive.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.111
Do you think she liked me?

17:10.480 --> 17:12.391
Hey, look at who's here!

17:12.560 --> 17:14.436
George, come on in. Come on.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.715
- I want you to come in here.
- Come on in, fat boy!

17:16.880 --> 17:19.872
Get a good night's sleep,
all right, fellas? Big day tomorrow.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.959
All right.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.678
Last one.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.952
Here you are.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.471
- Where's the boys?
- No, I let them sleep in.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.949
I'm on my way to cash in
their plane tickets for them.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.553
They need a little food money.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.757
- The meeting starts in 10 minutes.
- Well, I set their alarm.

17:46.920 --> 17:49.309
But they did have a lot of sake
in that hot tub.

17:49.640 --> 17:51.039
I'm calling Jerry.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.434
- Yeah?
- Jerry!

17:56.600 --> 17:58.272
The Japanese guys had sake
in the hot tub.

17:58.440 --> 17:59.793
You gotta get them down here...

17:59.960 --> 18:02.428
...or I don't have a focus group
to sell the pilot.

18:02.760 --> 18:05.069
Uncle Leo?

18:05.240 --> 18:06.434
Jerry!

18:07.360 --> 18:09.794
All right, all right. I'll wake them up.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.279
Testy.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.039
Hello?

18:17.200 --> 18:21.671
- Mr. Jerry, open the drawer, please.
- It's stuck.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.035
The steam from the hot tub
must have warped the wood.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.918
- Pull harder.
- I'm trying.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.878
I can't get a grip.
My hand's had kind of a bad week.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.871
Very funny. But no joking, please.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.719
Don't worry, I'll get you out.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.710
Brett, believe me,
you don't have to do this.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.757
Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.480
It's not as nice
as Kramer's cabinets, but it's a start.

18:41.640 --> 18:45.349
Well, I promise you, Jerry is not
jealous of Kramer's cabinets.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.670
Move to the back of the drawers!

18:47.840 --> 18:49.478
Jerry?

18:49.960 --> 18:51.234
Jerry.

18:51.680 --> 18:54.114
Not the Farbman!

19:19.240 --> 19:22.198
So, gentlemen, we have a deal?

19:33.960 --> 19:37.077
Excuse me. Did you hire
the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?

19:37.280 --> 19:42.149
Yes. To clean up the coffee stain
left by Jerry Seinfeld.

19:45.360 --> 19:50.115
Mr... Mr. Wilhelm, what?
What are you doing here?

19:50.400 --> 19:52.356
I'm here to clean the carpets.

19:52.520 --> 19:57.594
Most of the world is carpeted,
and one day, we will do the cleaning.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.279
Him, you brainwashed?

20:02.440 --> 20:03.873
What's he got that I don't have?

20:06.360 --> 20:07.952
Mr. Wilhelm, you've been abducted.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.792
Mr. Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.552
Wilhelm?

20:12.960 --> 20:15.520
My name is Tanya.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.391
Brett, I'm... I'm really sorry.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.831
I didn't mean to hit you
in the head with an axe.

20:38.440 --> 20:40.431
At least it was just a handle.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.279
Those beautiful cabinets.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.592
What am I gonna tell...?

20:44.920 --> 20:47.354
- I can't remember his name.
- Fleckman?

20:47.520 --> 20:48.794
Calm down, Brett. Okay?

20:48.960 --> 20:52.430
You could have a concussion.
Calm down.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.799
- His pulse is fine.
- Looks like a minor concussion.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.952
Let me see what I can do
to relieve the swelling.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.558
Doctor?

21:24.800 --> 21:26.199
Doctor?

21:27.240 --> 21:28.958
Doctor?

21:30.800 --> 21:33.473
Doctor, I think we're losing him.
