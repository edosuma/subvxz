WEBVTT

00:02.285 --> 00:05.277
- So, what do you think?
- Wow.

00:07.390 --> 00:08.789
It's for you, right?

00:09.893 --> 00:12.293
It's for both of us. Don't go away.

00:12.762 --> 00:16.163
Don't worry. There's not enough blood
left in my legs to go anywhere.

00:20.270 --> 00:23.330
<i>Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.</i>

00:24.941 --> 00:28.240
<i>Listen, you lousy S.O.B.,
I will not be treated like this.</i>

00:28.511 --> 00:32.277
<i>Either you call me,
or you are gonna be very, very sorry.</i>

00:32.415 --> 00:33.973
<i>I love you, Monkey Man.</i>

00:34.084 --> 00:35.449
Charlie?

00:37.253 --> 00:38.686
Who was that?

00:38.788 --> 00:40.449
Damn telemarketers.

00:41.191 --> 00:43.489
A telemarketer who calls you
Monkey Man?

00:44.294 --> 00:46.262
I'm on some weird list.

00:49.099 --> 00:53.035
Okay, it's a woman I went out with once
and she got a little clingy.

00:53.169 --> 00:55.797
You are a bad, bad boy.

00:56.039 --> 00:58.473
And yet, you're always the one
getting spanked.

01:01.878 --> 01:03.175
Jeez.

01:04.147 --> 01:07.014
<i>Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.</i>

01:08.518 --> 01:11.043
<i>Charlie, it's Alan. Your brother.</i>

01:11.888 --> 01:14.982
<i>No big deal, just wanted to touch base.</i>

01:15.125 --> 01:18.185
<i>My wife threw me out,
and I'm kind of losing the will to live.</i>

01:18.294 --> 01:21.559
<i>So, when you get a chance,
I'd really love to... I don't know...</i>

01:21.664 --> 01:23.791
Alan, I'm sorry to hear about that.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.862
So, where you gonna go, to a hotel? Wow.

01:29.739 --> 01:33.175
Well, yeah, I guess you could stay here.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.702
Okay. I'll see you when you get here.

01:37.914 --> 01:39.381
We better hurry.

01:47.857 --> 01:50.883
Is she staying over?
Because I may have parked behind her.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.836 --> 02:01.997
Twelve years, and she just throws me out.

02:02.071 --> 02:04.164
I mean, what was the point
of our wedding vows?

02:04.240 --> 02:07.334
You know, "Till death do us part. "
Who died? Not me. Not her.

02:09.211 --> 02:10.907
How did you get in my house?

02:12.182 --> 02:16.551
Okay, Charlie, the key in the fake rock
only works if it's among other rocks.

02:17.954 --> 02:19.717
Not sitting on your welcome mat.

02:20.723 --> 02:24.853
Excuse me, but if you put the fake rock
in with a bunch of other rocks,

02:24.928 --> 02:27.294
it's impossible to find when you're drunk.

02:28.531 --> 02:30.965
You know, I'm a good husband.
I'm faithful.

02:31.034 --> 02:32.626
- Is she?
- Is she what?

02:32.936 --> 02:34.267
Faithful.

02:37.273 --> 02:39.935
Don't be ridiculous.
Judith doesn't even like sex.

02:40.009 --> 02:42.739
I mean, all she kept saying was
she feels suffocated, you know?

02:42.812 --> 02:44.871
She kept going on and on,
"I'm suffocating. "

02:44.948 --> 02:48.111
What does that mean, you know?
Has a woman ever said that to you?

02:48.651 --> 02:49.948
Well, yeah.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.912
But not a woman who doesn't like sex.

02:56.059 --> 02:59.085
And Jake. This could just destroy Jake.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.556
- Jake?
- My son.

03:03.466 --> 03:06.230
Teenagers are pretty sophisticated
these days.

03:06.302 --> 03:07.667
He's 10.

03:09.072 --> 03:10.869
- Charlie, I'm going to go.
- No.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.999
You two need to talk.
I'll call you tomorrow.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.009
I'm sorry to hear about you and your wife.

03:15.111 --> 03:18.239
Come on, you leaving isn't gonna
bring them back together again.

03:21.150 --> 03:23.550
Look, okay,
this is just until things settle out.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.453
A couple of days max.
She will come to her senses.

03:26.990 --> 03:28.821
Yeah. That's what women do.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.990
Look, you can have the guest room.
I'll grab some sheets.

03:34.063 --> 03:36.190
That's okay. I brought my own.

03:38.167 --> 03:39.794
You brought your own sheets?

03:39.869 --> 03:41.131
I like my sheets.

03:43.339 --> 03:46.274
- Okay, then, good night.
- No, wait.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.271
I mean, we hardly ever talk to each other.

03:50.446 --> 03:52.346
What do you want to talk about, Alan?

03:52.548 --> 03:54.311
I don't know.

03:55.285 --> 03:57.116
I was named Chiropractor of the Year

03:57.186 --> 03:59.814
by the San Fernando
Valley Chiropractic Association.

04:00.857 --> 04:02.950
- Okay, then. Good night.
- No.

04:03.026 --> 04:04.459
Charlie, what about you?

04:05.728 --> 04:07.218
What's going on with you?

04:07.730 --> 04:09.630
Well, Alan, there's not much to say.

04:09.899 --> 04:12.493
I make a lot of money
for doing very little work.

04:12.568 --> 04:15.662
I sleep with beautiful women
who don't ask about my feelings.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.000
I drive a Jag, I live at the beach,

04:18.074 --> 04:21.339
and sometimes in the middle of the day,
for no reason at all,

04:21.411 --> 04:24.141
I like to make myself
a big pitcher of margaritas

04:24.213 --> 04:25.874
and take a nap out on the sundeck.

04:31.654 --> 04:34.350
- Okay, then. Good night, Charlie.
- Good night.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.718
Good night, Monkey Man.

04:50.873 --> 04:53.706
Boy, is your eye red.

04:55.511 --> 04:57.172
You should see it from in here.

04:59.415 --> 05:01.042
What are you doing here, Jake?

05:01.117 --> 05:02.584
My mom brought me.

05:03.019 --> 05:05.044
Will you take me swimming in the ocean?

05:06.456 --> 05:09.084
Can we talk about it
after my head stops exploding?

05:10.860 --> 05:12.452
Why is your head exploding?

05:13.596 --> 05:16.588
Well, I drank a little too much wine
last night.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.933
If it makes you feel bad,
why do you drink it?

05:21.738 --> 05:23.535
Nobody likes a wiseass, Jake.

05:25.408 --> 05:28.605
You have to put $1 in the swear jar.
You said "ass. "

05:30.480 --> 05:31.879
Tell you what,

05:31.948 --> 05:34.246
here's $20.
That should cover me till lunch.

05:35.952 --> 05:39.149
Now, what I think you need to do
is to make a list.

05:39.255 --> 05:42.088
On one side, put what you don't like
about our marriage,

05:42.158 --> 05:43.819
and on the other side, what you do.

05:43.926 --> 05:46.656
Alan, sometimes when I think
about coming home to you,

05:46.763 --> 05:48.424
I start crying in my car.

05:51.234 --> 05:53.725
Okay, that would probably
go on the "don't" side.

05:54.404 --> 05:57.305
Why would I lie?
The ocean is closed today.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.608
For God's sake, do you think
you could put some pants on?

06:01.677 --> 06:04.510
Look at me, Judy.
I could barely make it down the stairs.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.246
Charlie, could you and Jake...

06:08.317 --> 06:11.013
Yeah, come on, kid,
we'll have breakfast out on the deck.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.587
I already had breakfast.

06:12.655 --> 06:14.987
- Okay, we'll have lunch.
- It's not lunchtime.

06:18.361 --> 06:19.919
That's his head exploding.

06:22.498 --> 06:24.261
Judith, I can change.

06:24.534 --> 06:27.469
Please, Alan.
You are the most rigid, inflexible,

06:27.537 --> 06:29.869
obsessive, anal-retentive man
I've ever met.

06:32.041 --> 06:33.599
Rigid and inflexible?

06:34.377 --> 06:36.937
Don't you think that's a little redundant?

06:50.193 --> 06:52.354
My mom and dad are splitting up.

06:52.628 --> 06:54.391
Yeah. It looks that way.

06:55.698 --> 06:56.892
You're lucky.

06:57.467 --> 07:00.994
When I was your age, I could only dream
about my parents splitting up.

07:02.171 --> 07:04.867
- Your mom is my grandma.
- Yep.

07:05.374 --> 07:07.638
Grandma says
you're a bitter disappointment.

07:10.713 --> 07:13.375
Hey, sport,
your mom wants to say goodbye.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.485
Listen, he doesn't know anything
about what's going on,

07:20.556 --> 07:22.490
so let's just keep this to ourselves.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.994
Our little secret.
Why is she saying goodbye to him?

07:27.830 --> 07:31.027
She's gonna be spending the weekend
with her sister in Vegas.

07:31.767 --> 07:34.167
So, we decided that
Jake would stay with me.

07:34.737 --> 07:35.931
With you?

07:36.739 --> 07:38.104
Well, with us.

07:39.175 --> 07:40.335
I'm hungry.

07:40.409 --> 07:41.876
Is this gonna be a problem?

07:49.285 --> 07:50.582
I guess not.

07:51.454 --> 07:53.820
Thanks. Listen, I've got to call my office.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.687
Would you mind making him lunch?

07:59.262 --> 08:00.752
- Sure.
- Thanks.

08:04.367 --> 08:05.800
What are you smiling about?

08:05.902 --> 08:07.460
You don't have any food.

08:08.938 --> 08:11.031
Yeah, but I'm not the one who's hungry.

08:12.775 --> 08:14.402
Who's smiling now, shorty?

08:17.380 --> 08:19.439
- You drink milk?
- Just with cereal.

08:20.883 --> 08:24.614
- Okay.
- Not that milk. That milk.

08:26.656 --> 08:30.387
- What's the difference?
- That's Dairy Farm. We drink Dairy Barn.

08:34.130 --> 08:36.496
Fine. Happy?

08:37.232 --> 08:39.496
Why would I be happy? It's just milk.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.740
Cute. Keep it up,
you'll be on one of the cartons.

08:51.013 --> 08:52.241
Okay, cereal.

08:52.315 --> 08:55.978
We got Lucky Charms, Cocoa Puffs,
Frosted Flakes and Maple Loops.

08:56.085 --> 08:57.416
I want Maple Loops.

09:06.929 --> 09:08.191
You know who wrote that song?

09:08.264 --> 09:10.095
- Your uncle Charlie wrote that.
- No lie?

09:10.166 --> 09:12.566
<i>If I was to lie, I'd say I wrote
Stairway to Heaven,</i>

09:12.635 --> 09:14.102
not the Maple Loops song.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.671
- You two are really good together.
- Thank you.

09:19.442 --> 09:21.000
So, does your wife sing, too?

09:22.011 --> 09:24.741
- No, I'm not married.
- What a shame.

09:29.151 --> 09:32.518
Wow. You're even better than a dog.

09:37.159 --> 09:40.356
Dr. Bloom? Yes, this is Alan Harper.

09:40.630 --> 09:44.794
My wife and I need to cancel our marriage
counseling appointment for this afternoon.

09:46.369 --> 09:48.166
Yes, well, something came up.

09:49.472 --> 09:52.305
Well, it's kind of personal. I mean...

09:53.042 --> 09:55.602
Well, yeah,
I know the point of these things is...

09:57.980 --> 09:59.277
I've got to go.

10:00.650 --> 10:02.709
- Hello?
- Is Charlie home?

10:02.985 --> 10:05.715
No. I'm Charlie's brother. Can I help you?

10:07.223 --> 10:10.556
Hi, Charlie's brother. I'm Rose.

10:10.826 --> 10:12.657
I'm Charlie's housekeeper.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.387
So, you're a housekeeper?

10:15.498 --> 10:18.160
Housekeeper /actress/hand model.

10:19.335 --> 10:21.769
I just do this to keep the wolf
from the door.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.071
You know what I mean?

10:26.676 --> 10:28.337
Sure. Come on in.

10:33.749 --> 10:35.307
Yeah, I can smell him.

10:37.553 --> 10:38.918
Smell who?

10:38.988 --> 10:42.014
Your brother. He has a very musky scent.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.392
Well, I'll just let you get to work.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.428
Wait.

10:57.173 --> 10:58.504
No. It's okay.

11:06.415 --> 11:08.246
Jake, buddy. Take a break.

11:09.685 --> 11:11.380
What took you so long?

11:11.721 --> 11:14.281
We stopped for ice cream
because I'm a babe magnet.

11:17.126 --> 11:18.559
I got to take a squirt.

11:21.731 --> 11:23.858
Why do you assume
he learned that from me?

11:24.867 --> 11:26.596
Because I learned it from you.

11:29.638 --> 11:32.732
- Hey, thanks for cleaning up.
- No, it wasn't me. Rose was here.

11:33.309 --> 11:35.800
Rose? You let Rose into my house?

11:36.045 --> 11:37.569
She said she was your maid.

11:38.214 --> 11:40.944
Hell, she glued the damn cabinets
shut again.

11:42.051 --> 11:43.143
Again?

11:43.219 --> 11:46.313
You've got somebody who comes in
regularly to glue your cabinets?

11:46.422 --> 11:48.913
You've met some of the whack jobs
I've gone out with.

11:48.991 --> 11:51.824
- It's not that big a stretch.
- So, this is my fault?

11:52.061 --> 11:53.255
Who let her in?

11:53.329 --> 11:56.162
You're a deeply disturbed man,
you know? Move it. Come on.

11:56.265 --> 11:57.664
I'm deeply disturbed?

11:57.767 --> 12:00.736
Who came here in the middle
of the night with his own sheets?

12:00.803 --> 12:04.068
At least, I care what I sleep on.
Or should I say, who I sleep on.

12:05.107 --> 12:06.802
Hey, pal, of the two of us,

12:06.909 --> 12:10.276
I'll bet I'm the only one who's slept
with a married woman recently.

12:10.346 --> 12:12.644
And isn't that something to brag about?

12:17.420 --> 12:18.648
Hi, Mom.

12:20.256 --> 12:22.724
Do you have any idea how hurtful it is

12:22.792 --> 12:25.920
to hear about your own son's divorce
on the street?

12:26.262 --> 12:28.025
What divorce? What street?

12:29.498 --> 12:31.329
How did you get in my house?

12:32.201 --> 12:33.463
You stay out of this.

12:33.536 --> 12:36.596
I'm here to help your brother
through a very difficult time.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.364
How could you do this to me?

12:40.376 --> 12:41.468
Do what?

12:41.544 --> 12:43.535
Now when I want to see my grandson

12:43.612 --> 12:46.376
I am going to have to make
an appointment with Judith,

12:46.449 --> 12:48.883
who, let's face it,
was never very warm to me.

12:49.218 --> 12:52.381
And what if there's another man there?
Shacking up with her?

12:52.855 --> 12:54.846
Have we even stopped to consider that?

12:59.395 --> 13:01.625
I think he's considering it now, Mom.

13:02.798 --> 13:05.790
- Here's your iced tea, Grandma.
- Thank you, my little angel.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.836
Darling, I asked for a lemon wedge.

13:11.574 --> 13:13.633
All right. Here's what you're going to do.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.836
You and Jake will come live with me.

13:16.145 --> 13:19.808
After all, I'm just rattling around
in that big house all by myself.

13:20.216 --> 13:23.777
That's very considerate, but as soon as
Judith and I work things out,

13:23.853 --> 13:25.514
I'm going to be back at my own house.

13:25.588 --> 13:27.579
Sweetheart, grow up.

13:29.859 --> 13:31.349
Think about what I said.

13:31.727 --> 13:35.356
You're my son, and I'll always have room
for you in my house

13:35.731 --> 13:37.164
and in my heart.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.531
I love you, too, Mom.

13:50.613 --> 13:54.071
- I love you, too, Mom.
- Too little. Too late.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.051
- So, Vegas was good?
- It was fine.

14:00.189 --> 14:03.352
Alan, I really want to apologize
for putting you through this.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.620
I was wrong to blame you
for my unhappiness.

14:05.728 --> 14:07.252
No, no need to apologize.

14:07.363 --> 14:10.662
What's important is that we're here
and we're working on our marriage.

14:10.733 --> 14:11.995
You look great, by the way.

14:12.067 --> 14:14.729
Must be all the extra oxygen
they pump into the casinos.

14:14.803 --> 14:16.532
- Alan...
- And you were right.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.369
I see now that the time apart
did us both a lot of good.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.567
I know I've grown.

14:20.643 --> 14:23.373
I'm not that suffocating guy
you threw out of the house

14:23.445 --> 14:25.413
four and a half days ago,
let me tell you that.

14:25.481 --> 14:26.675
Jake's doing fine.

14:26.749 --> 14:29.081
You were concerned about him
being around my brother,

14:29.151 --> 14:30.812
but Charlie's great with kids.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.953
All right, last card, down and dirty.

14:35.758 --> 14:36.918
King's bet.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.125
- $1.
- I'm in.

14:39.228 --> 14:40.422
In.

14:41.230 --> 14:44.393
I'll see $1 and raise it $5.

14:47.069 --> 14:48.798
You raised $5 on that?

14:48.904 --> 14:50.428
- I call.
- I call.

14:52.775 --> 14:54.572
Queens full of nines.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.071
Kid, don't you know what a full house is?

14:58.147 --> 15:00.411
Yeah. And I also know what a psych-out is.

15:02.284 --> 15:03.683
I love this boy.

15:05.120 --> 15:09.352
And I think we're gonna look back on this
as a new beginning for our marriage.

15:09.425 --> 15:11.290
A rebirth. A renaissance, if you will.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.918
Alan, I think I'm gay.

15:17.266 --> 15:18.460
All right.

15:20.703 --> 15:22.170
We'll make a list.

15:23.973 --> 15:25.964
On one side, we'll put gay stuff...

15:26.942 --> 15:28.432
I'll see you

15:29.945 --> 15:31.435
and raise you $20.

15:35.484 --> 15:38.180
- I think he's got you, pal.
- He's bluffing.

15:38.988 --> 15:41.115
He always pulls his ear when he bluffs.

15:42.725 --> 15:44.989
How about it, Mighty Mouse? You in?

15:47.329 --> 15:48.660
Take him down.

15:53.636 --> 15:54.728
Call you.

15:55.804 --> 15:57.294
I hate this kid.

15:59.742 --> 16:01.403
What the hell is going on here?

16:01.543 --> 16:02.908
You said "hell. "

16:04.313 --> 16:06.838
- Throw $1 in the pot.
- What?

16:07.316 --> 16:08.908
Hey, we all had to.

16:11.020 --> 16:13.545
Charlie, may I speak with you
privately, please?

16:14.690 --> 16:16.487
- Whose deal is it?
- Jake, go to bed!

16:16.558 --> 16:17.718
I'm out.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.425
What is wrong with you? Are you insane?

16:20.529 --> 16:22.394
Do you have any sense
of right and wrong?

16:22.498 --> 16:24.261
Probably not. How was dinner?

16:24.366 --> 16:27.028
How could you put Jake in a poker game
with grown men?

16:27.102 --> 16:29.161
I obviously can't be trusted.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.331
So, how was dinner?

16:32.408 --> 16:34.706
I leave you alone with him
for a couple of hours...

16:34.777 --> 16:36.472
I'm just gonna keep asking, Alan.

16:36.545 --> 16:39.571
Dinner was swell. We both had
the veal piccata and she's gay!

16:42.785 --> 16:44.116
Wow.

16:45.521 --> 16:46.954
Most chicks won't eat veal.

16:49.458 --> 16:51.551
Why do I even try talking to you?

16:51.627 --> 16:54.221
Come on, I'm just trying to get you
to lighten up a little.

16:54.296 --> 16:56.958
I don't need to lighten up.
The world I live in is dark.

16:57.066 --> 16:58.294
Dark and rainy.

16:58.467 --> 17:00.094
And you're useless in it!

17:00.202 --> 17:03.638
Really? I wasn't useless
when you needed a place to stay.

17:04.272 --> 17:06.104
Obviously that was a mistake.

17:06.575 --> 17:07.973
Are you sure?

17:08.911 --> 17:10.640
Maybe we should make a list.

17:25.260 --> 17:26.625
Uncle Charlie?

17:28.163 --> 17:30.154
What's going on? Can't sleep?

17:30.999 --> 17:32.159
No.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.062
My dad says we're moving
to Grandma's tomorrow.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.072
Yeah, that'd keep me up.

17:41.510 --> 17:44.638
If it makes you feel any better,
you won $80 on that last hand.

17:44.747 --> 17:45.907
$85.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.915
$80. The house gets a cut.

17:49.785 --> 17:51.810
I wish my dad was as cool as you.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.053
Don't sell your dad short.

17:54.123 --> 17:56.284
He loves you
more than anything in the world.

17:56.358 --> 17:57.791
You know that, don't you?

17:58.327 --> 17:59.521
I guess.

18:03.799 --> 18:05.926
How come you don't have any kids?

18:07.836 --> 18:09.064
I don't know.

18:09.138 --> 18:12.301
Maybe because I love me
more than anything in the world.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.603
- Uncle Charlie?
- Yeah?

18:17.412 --> 18:20.074
I don't want to go to Grandma's.
I'd rather stay here.

18:21.950 --> 18:24.817
Yeah, well, your dad knows
what's best for you.

18:26.088 --> 18:30.457
Okay. Good night, Uncle Charlie.
I love you.

18:33.428 --> 18:36.261
Yeah. Okay.

18:46.175 --> 18:48.040
You got to love a kid like that.

18:48.477 --> 18:50.377
<i>I even played him Stairway to Heaven</i>

18:50.479 --> 18:53.107
and he still liked
the Maple Loops song better.

18:53.182 --> 18:55.616
Charlie, I haven't seen you in two weeks.

18:55.684 --> 18:57.618
You finally got the house back to yourself.

18:57.686 --> 19:01.281
Now, do you want to talk about
your nephew, or do you want to have sex?

19:01.356 --> 19:02.823
Sex. Definitely sex.

19:09.698 --> 19:11.495
- Let me ask you something.
- Yeah?

19:13.001 --> 19:14.628
Do you ever think about having kids?

19:14.703 --> 19:18.161
Whoa, we've got a good thing going.
Can't we just leave it at that?

19:18.240 --> 19:20.572
What are you doing?
I thought we were gonna have sex.

19:20.642 --> 19:24.169
How am I supposed to have sex
while your biological clock is going off?

19:28.083 --> 19:31.211
<i>Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.</i>

19:33.255 --> 19:34.745
<i>Hi, Monkey Man.</i>

19:36.024 --> 19:38.083
<i>I was just thinking about you</i>

19:38.160 --> 19:40.924
<i>and wondering why we hurt each other
so much.</i>

19:40.996 --> 19:43.897
Rose, it's me, Monkey Man.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.267
<i>- Charlie?
- Yeah, listen, let me ask you a question.</i>

19:48.737 --> 19:50.728
Is there something
inherently wrong with

19:50.839 --> 19:53.501
asking a woman you're involved with
if she wants kids?

19:53.876 --> 19:57.209
<i>Charlie, we got a good thing going,
why do you want to mess it up?</i>

20:01.250 --> 20:05.118
Look at you.
All grown up and back living with Mom.

20:06.188 --> 20:08.281
How good do you feel about yourself
right now?

20:08.390 --> 20:11.018
On a scale of one to two.

20:12.361 --> 20:13.794
I'm not back living with Mom.

20:13.896 --> 20:16.831
I'm simply staying here
till Judith and I work things out.

20:16.899 --> 20:18.628
So, one?

20:20.369 --> 20:21.700
What do you want, Charlie?

20:21.770 --> 20:24.034
I figured you've been here
a couple of weeks,

20:24.106 --> 20:26.404
you got to have blood
in your stool by now.

20:32.915 --> 20:36.874
So, I thought if you and Jake wanted
to come back to my place for a while,

20:36.952 --> 20:38.715
- that'd be okay.
- Wait a minute.

20:38.787 --> 20:41.483
Are you saying you want me
to come back and live with you?

20:41.590 --> 20:43.558
Well, truthfully, no.

20:44.593 --> 20:46.652
I want Jake to come back
and live with me,

20:46.728 --> 20:48.559
but I figure you're a package deal.

20:49.131 --> 20:51.599
Thanks, but we're doing just fine
here with Mom.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.164
Come on. We can't let Jake be exposed
to her on any kind of ongoing basis.

20:56.271 --> 20:58.739
There's no ongoing basis.
He's only here on weekends.

20:58.807 --> 21:00.172
That's too much.

21:01.109 --> 21:03.976
Piranhas can strip an entire cow
in an hour.

21:05.647 --> 21:09.310
Alan, we've got to get him away from her.
I mean, look what happened to us.

21:09.785 --> 21:11.616
And what happened to you?

21:12.321 --> 21:13.618
Hi, Mom.

21:14.489 --> 21:16.116
Charlie, you're a grown man.

21:16.191 --> 21:19.854
Perhaps it's time to stop blaming
your mother for your own shortcomings.

21:19.962 --> 21:21.896
Alan, the divan is not for sitting.

21:21.964 --> 21:23.693
Charlie, get off the couch.

21:25.434 --> 21:26.662
Uncle Charlie.

21:27.135 --> 21:29.000
There's my good boy.

21:29.338 --> 21:31.932
And what did I tell you
about yelling in the house?

21:32.040 --> 21:33.701
Grandma, I'm suffocating.

21:35.777 --> 21:37.176
Sound familiar?

21:37.479 --> 21:39.845
You're right, this madness must end.

21:41.683 --> 21:43.981
Here, I got you your own key.

21:51.693 --> 21:55.254
I am not comfortable with this.
I mean, maybe I should go wait in the car.

21:55.330 --> 21:56.797
You're not waiting in the car.

21:56.865 --> 21:58.799
Trust me, this is a great way
to meet women.

21:58.867 --> 22:00.960
I don't want to meet women.
I'm still married.

22:01.036 --> 22:03.937
Come on, your wife's out meeting chicks,
why shouldn't you?

22:11.546 --> 22:13.377
Your son is just adorable.

22:14.216 --> 22:16.150
- Thank you.
- You and your

22:16.385 --> 22:18.512
life partner must be so proud.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.553
You're right. Go wait in the car.

22:52.087 --> 22:53.281
