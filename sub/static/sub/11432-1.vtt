13:17.588 --> 13:20.675
AND HE TOLD HER IT WAS EXACTLY
TWO INCHES BELOW THE LEFT NIPPLE.

13:20.967 --> 13:24.178
SO AFTER SHE GOT

AND SHE'S RUBBING

14:07.680 --> 14:11.100

15:07.115 --> 15:08.741

AND YOU CAN COOL IT...

15:17.125 --> 15:18.751

-HI.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.377
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE FIRE.

16:02.837 --> 16:05.548
YOU CAN'T HAVE A FIRE,
BUT YOU CAN HAVE WATER.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.890
THESE-- THESE ROCKS
ARE SCARRED NOW,

16:14.182 --> 16:17.435
BUT IF YOU PUT 'EM IN THE STREAM BED, THE
WATER MIGHT CLEAN THEM UP EVENTUALLY.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.313
- OKAY.

16:20.605 --> 16:21.814
THANK YOU.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.442
COME ON, MAYA.

16:28.446 --> 16:29.363
Raven: JACK...

16:30.531 --> 16:31.908
WE'RE GONNA MAKE
A WATER TRAR

16:32.200 --> 16:34.160

CARRY ALL THESE ROCKS?

16:38.289 --> 16:40.166
Raven: THIS IS VERY COOL.

16:40.458 --> 16:43.920
SO IF YOU'RE EVER STUCK IN THE DESERT, EVEN
OUT HERE, AND YOU RUN OUT OF WATER...

16:44.212 --> 16:46.589
SO YOU DIG A HOLE
ABOUT EIGHT INCHES DEEP,

16:46.881 --> 16:48.216
EIGHT TO TEN.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.717
UNDER THAT BUNCH.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.928
AND THEN YOU
LINE THE HOLE

16:52.220 --> 16:53.888
WITH BLACK PLASTIC.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.807
SO HERE WE GO.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.186
ALL RIGHT?
POSSIBLY SAVE YOUR LIFE.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.898
THIS WILL COLLECT
THE HEAT DURING THE DAY,

17:04.190 --> 17:05.775
AND THEN AT NIGHT,
THE GROUND COOLS.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.194
THE TEMPERATURE
CONVERSION IN THE MORNING

17:08.486 --> 17:11.614
WILL COLLECT THE CONDENSATION
AND YOU'LL HAVE WATER.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.366
NOT A LOT OF WATER,
BUT A LITTLE.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.284
ENOUGH TO MAYBE
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.663
WATER TRAP.

-Mayai DO YOU EVER CHANGE THEM?

36:28.061 --> 36:29.229

36:49.874 --> 36:50.792

36:51.876 --> 36:53.002
- WHY DID SHE LEAVE?

36:56.715 --> 36:59.008
- BECAUSE WE WERE
HURTING EACH OTHER.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.138
I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION...

37:03.430 --> 37:04.889
FOR ME AND FOR US.

37:06.599 --> 37:08.476
WHAT? YOU KNOW,
I WILL ALWAYS PROTECT YOU.

37:15.024 --> 37:18.987
HEY, HONEY, I'M REALLY
PROUD OF BOTH OF YOU.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.036
- OH, HONEY.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.417

- HURRY.

45:21.427 --> 45:22.220
-I'M GETTING OUT.

45:40.071 --> 45:41.030

45:53.626 --> 45:54.961
Joe: IT IS ONE OF THE...

45:56.045 --> 45:57.546
GLORIOUS GIFTS OF LIFE.

45:58.798 --> 46:00.049
IT JUST HIT ME.

46:05.179 --> 46:06.681
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

46:08.015 --> 46:11.102
- I'M HAVING
A REALLY BAD DAY.

46:11.394 --> 46:13.354
- YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

46:17.608 --> 46:19.318
-IT'S EMBARRASSING.

46:19.610 --> 46:21.988
EMBARRASSMENT IS NOT FATAL.

46:25.241 --> 46:27.243
-I'M TRYING TO WORK
ON FORGIVENESS.

46:28.703 --> 46:29.787
- FORGIVENESS, HUH?

46:31.038 --> 46:32.123
THAT'S A BIG ONE.

46:34.583 --> 46:38.587
I WISH I COULD TAKE BACK EVERY
HURTFUL THING I EVER SAID.

46:41.716 --> 46:43.759
BUT MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
MAKES LIFE A LITTLE SWEETER.

46:45.303 --> 46:46.762
TO HAVE THE SHIT...

46:47.054 --> 46:48.097
TO COMPARE TO THE SHINE.

46:50.099 --> 46:51.267
PERSPECTIVE.

46:53.060 --> 46:55.062
ANOTHER ONE OF
THOSE GIFTS OF AGE.

46:59.525 --> 47:01.193
- MAYBE IT'S ALL
GONNA WORK OUT.

47:02.737 --> 47:03.946
- AND THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

47:09.952 --> 47:11.746
- STANDING...

47:12.038 --> 47:12.830
NOT SUCH A GIFT.

47:15.333 --> 47:16.792

47:30.598 --> 47:31.640
- BOY, THAT'S ME.

47:33.351 --> 47:34.727
STRANGE AND CARING.

47:38.689 --> 47:42.693
- ANGELA WAS LIKE A
TORNADO PASSING THROUGH.

47:42.985 --> 47:47.156
WILD, THRILLING AND
TOTALLY DESTRUCTIVE.

47:47.448 --> 47:48.991
BUT THE KIDS LOVED HER.

47:50.201 --> 47:51.410
I WAS...

47:53.746 --> 47:54.955
CONSUMED BY HER.

48:00.628 --> 48:02.546
I DIDN'T...

48:02.838 --> 48:04.965
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING
ON WITH MY OWN CHILDREN.

48:10.388 --> 48:11.639
WE HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE.

48:11.931 --> 48:13.766
I TOOK MY VACATION EARLY...

48:15.184 --> 48:16.310
AND HERE WE ARE.

48:18.729 --> 48:19.855
- THAT WAS A VERY...

48:21.107 --> 48:22.233
BRAVE MOVE, KATE.

48:27.488 --> 48:28.572
-I'M A LITTLE RUSTY, BUT--

48:31.200 --> 48:34.120
WE USED TO HAVE
A LOT OF FUN HERE.

48:35.204 --> 48:36.956
- DON'T WORRY.

48:37.248 --> 48:38.499
YOU'LL HAVE FUN HERE AGAIN.

48:39.834 --> 48:41.335
- YEAH?
-OH, YEAH.

48:46.340 --> 48:47.466
- YEAH.

48:51.554 --> 48:53.639
HEY, JOE, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU KNOWN RAVEN?

48:53.931 --> 48:55.558
- HER WHOLE LIFE...

48:55.850 --> 48:57.476
PRETTY MUCH.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.687
HER FOLKS BOUGHT
MY DADDY'S CABIN...

49:01.397 --> 49:03.441
AS A GETAWAY
FROM THE BIG CITY.

49:03.732 --> 49:05.192
- AND SHE DOESN'T LIVE HERE?

49:06.360 --> 49:08.487
- NO.

49:08.779 --> 49:13.451
BUT SHE HAS BEEN HOLED UP IN THAT
CABIN SINCE EVERYTHING FELL APART.

49:15.536 --> 49:16.704
- WHAT HAPPENED?

49:18.581 --> 49:20.958
- SHE LOST HER NIECE
ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

49:22.168 --> 49:24.420
THEY WERE VERY CLOSE.

49:26.589 --> 49:27.882
-I'M SO SORRY.

49:30.426 --> 49:33.053
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO FEEL SORRY...

49:35.014 --> 49:37.224
AND RAVEN DOESN'T NEED
TO PUNISH HERSELF ANYMORE.

49:39.477 --> 49:40.686
WHAT WE NEED...

49:43.022 --> 49:44.815
IS TO EAT SOME COBBLER.

49:48.569 --> 49:50.529
- I LIKE YOU.

50:47.253 --> 50:49.964
-"THERE IS NO MISTAKING
THE RAUCOUS CAW...

50:50.256 --> 50:53.175
THE DEEP RESONANT CAW
IS ITS TRADEMARK."

50:53.467 --> 50:55.052
SEE, I TOLD YOU.

50:55.344 --> 50:56.303
- NO.

50:56.595 --> 50:57.680
- YOU NEED TO DRINK WATER, MAYA.

50:57.972 --> 50:59.807
-IT BLOATS ME.
-DON'T START THAT AGAIN.

51:00.099 --> 51:01.642
DRINK THE WATER.
YOU NEED IT.

51:02.977 --> 51:04.562
- DON'T TELL ME
THAT WAS A RAVEN.

51:04.853 --> 51:07.731
-IT IS IF IT'S
IMITATING A COYOTE.

51:08.023 --> 51:10.859
-"RAVENS ARE QUARRELSOME,
YET THEY DEMONSTRATE...

51:11.151 --> 51:13.571
CONSIDERABLE DEVOTION
TO THEIR FAMILIES."

52:05.331 --> 52:08.751
--J0e: IF SHE GOT IN HER MIND TO GO
FOR A RUN, SHE COULD BE GONE FOR DAYS.

52:11.503 --> 52:12.921
- HEY, JOE...

52:13.213 --> 52:15.507
WOULD YOU MIND STAYING WITH JACK
AND MAYA FOR A WHILE?

52:16.759 --> 52:18.093
- NOT AT ALL.

52:18.385 --> 52:19.303
- THANKS.

52:48.207 --> 52:49.500
- MY LEG IS BETTER.

52:49.792 --> 52:51.001
- OH, THAT'S GOOD.

52:51.293 --> 52:52.211
- WHAT HAPPENED?

52:52.503 --> 52:53.545
- OH!

52:56.006 --> 52:57.675
I WAS RACING DEMONS.

52:57.966 --> 52:58.884
- OH.

53:00.260 --> 53:01.345
- I LOST.

53:06.058 --> 53:07.142
- FOLLOW ME.

53:29.164 --> 53:30.290
SIT.

53:34.086 --> 53:35.504
I'M REALLY VERY
GOOD AT THIS.

53:35.796 --> 53:36.672
ASK MY KIDS.

53:44.888 --> 53:46.682
LET'S CLEAN UP
SOME OF THESE SCRATCHES.

53:48.434 --> 53:49.852
LET'S SEE.

53:52.521 --> 53:53.480
TAKE THIS OFF.

54:14.877 --> 54:15.794
OKAY.

54:32.227 --> 54:33.270
THERE.

54:39.318 --> 54:41.111
CAN I CLEAN THAT?

54:53.081 --> 54:54.374
IS THAT OKAY?

55:25.322 --> 55:26.907
IT'S NOT SO BAD.

57:53.178 --> 57:55.097
- STAY CLOSE. STAY CLOSE.

58:00.143 --> 58:01.937
YOU'RE OKAY,
COME HERE.

58:03.480 --> 58:04.523
YOU'RE OKAY.

58:05.691 --> 58:07.734
NO, NO, NO, NO. NO!

58:08.026 --> 58:10.320
NO!
-SHH, RAY... RAY.

58:12.364 --> 58:13.490
YOU WERE DREAMING.

58:13.782 --> 58:15.492
- I ALMOST REACHED HER THIS TIME.

58:19.997 --> 58:21.206
I ALMOST TOUCHED HER.

58:26.545 --> 58:28.005
I'M NEVER LATE.

58:29.840 --> 58:31.049
I'M NEVER LATE.

58:35.470 --> 58:36.513
HE DIDN'T KNOW HER.

58:38.724 --> 58:40.475
IT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH HER.

58:44.187 --> 58:47.024
HE WAS CRAZY AND HE HAD A GUN
AND SHE WAS THERE.

58:48.608 --> 58:50.027
BUT I SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE.

58:53.655 --> 58:54.614
-IT'S OKAY.

58:54.906 --> 58:56.199
- I SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE.

59:00.537 --> 59:02.205
-IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT'S OKAY.

59:02.497 --> 59:03.915
- NO.

59:08.545 --> 59:09.629
- WHAT?

59:12.424 --> 59:14.217
- I CAN'T FEEL GOOD.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.918
- HEY.

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:13.461
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:15.005
Maya: WE HIKED.

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:17.007
- SHE ACTUALLY DID.
IT'S LIKE A MIRACLE.

01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:19.593
- NOT REALLY MY THING.
-WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM?

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:21.386
- OH, SHE KNOWS WE'RE HIKING.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:22.846
- DOES SHE KNOW YOU'RE HERE?

01:01:23.972 --> 01:01:24.890
UMM...

01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:27.184
NO.

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:29.394
CAN WE HANG WITH YOU?

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.605
-I'M WORKING.

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:34.524

01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:44.075
I TOLD YOU
THIS WAS STUPID.

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:45.577
- HOW'D YOU FIND
YOUR WAY HERE?

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:46.870
- WE FIGURED IT OUT.

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:48.955
- Jack: WE KINDA JUST
FOLLOWED THE TRAILS.

01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:50.832
I KINDA SEEN YOU

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:52.459
- Raven: I'M IMPRESSED.

IS THAT HIS NICKNAME?
-Jack: SHE'S JUST JEALOUS.

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:57.547
Raven: UH-HUH.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.217
- YOU EVER GET
LOST OUT HERE?

01:02:00.508 --> 01:02:02.636
- THE MAIN TRAILS
LEAD TO THE ROADS...

01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:03.803
EVENTUALLY.

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:13.647
THE NEXT PERSON WHO COMES THROUGH
HERE WON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS SHIT.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:16.733
DETRITUS.

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:18.818
- I GOT ONE.

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.905
- DOESN'T IT JUST PISS THE SHIT OUT OF YOU
THAT PEOPLE TH ROW THEIR DETRITUS OUT HERE?

01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:23.657
-IT'S BETTER THAN EFFLUVIA.

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:26.618
-IT'S THE PROXIMITY TO THE
VAPOROUS FORM THAT'S HAZARDOUS.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.495
- TOUCHE.

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:33.541
YOU KNOW WHAT? MY DREAM
IS TO CLEAN ALL OF THIS UP.

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:34.918
BIT BY BIT IS FINE.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.294
Maya: PEOPLE SUCK.

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:37.796
- WELL, YOU CAN'T CONTROL THAT.

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.589
- WELL, THEN WHAT'S THE POINT?

01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:41.132
EVERYTHING PISSES HER OFF...

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.176
ESPECIALLY ME.

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:45.428
- BECAUSE YOU'RE A PUNK
ASSHOLE AND YOU NEVER SHUT UP.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.227
- YOU'LL HAVE TIME FOR
EVERYTHING YOU WANT.

01:02:56.982 --> 01:02:58.108
YOU SHOULD GET BACK
TO YOUR MOM.

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:22.007
Maya: THAT WAS ACTUALLY FUN.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:23.800
- JaCk: YEAH, I MEAN,
I KINDA THOUGHT...

01:03:24.092 --> 01:03:25.760
IT WOULD BE LIKE,
MORE WEIRD THAN FUN.

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:28.722
- Maya: BUT SHE'S NOT AS CRAZY. --JaCk:
WELL, YEAH, NOW THAT WE LIKE, KNOW HER.

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:32.726
I MEAN, REMEMBER
THE FIRST DAY WE SAW HER?

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:35.687
- THE BIRD AND THE SHIRT.
- YEAH.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:37.772
YOU THINK WE SHOULD
TELL MOM WE WENT?

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:39.149
- HEY, BEAUTIFUL.

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.901
HEY, HANDSOME.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:44.779
'HEY!

01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:48.283
- OH, WOW, YOU TWO ARE
SIGHT FOR SORE EYES.

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:51.369
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? -OH, YOUR
MOM DIDN'T TELL YOU I WAS COMING?

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.163
- NO, SHE SAID YOU WEREN'T.

01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:55.749
- SHE MUST'VE WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU.
-SHE KNOWS?

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:57.667
- LET'S TAKE A WALK.

01:03:57.959 --> 01:04:00.378
- OKAY. -I WANT TO
KNOW ALL THE GOSSIP...

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:01.963
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:03.673
AND YOU CAN TELL ME...

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:05.717
ALL ABOUT HOTFIE SCOTTY.

01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:17.312
- YOU KNOW SHE DOESN'T LIKE SCOT
SO WE'VE BEEN SNEAKING AROUND...

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:19.564
BUT SHE CAUGHT US IN BED,
SO SHE BROUGHT US HERE.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.691
- OH, HONEY, THAT'S BIG.

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:23.526
DID YOU TWO--
-IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL.

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:25.320
-IT'S NOT WHAT YOU TOLD MOM.

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:29.282
- OH, YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO TALK
TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LISTEN.

01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:31.743
OH, SWEETIE,
YOU ARE GROWING UP.

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:34.371
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, HANDSOME?

01:04:34.662 --> 01:04:35.789
DO YOU HAVE A NEW
GIRLFRIEND?

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:36.998
- NOT REALLY.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:38.750
- HE CAN'T SEEM TO FIND
HIS BRAIN AROUND GIRLS.

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.169
- SHUT UP.
-SHE'S JUST MESSING WITH YOU.

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:42.629
I HAVE AN IDEA.

01:04:42.921 --> 01:04:45.215
LET'S GO TO TOWN AND PICK

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:47.008

- OF COURSE HE DOES.

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:26.464
- SEE, I WISH SHE UNDERSTOOD
ME THE WAY YOU DO.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:29.592
- Angela: SHE JUST
DOESN'T GET IT, YOU KNOW?

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:31.386

WHO WAS THAT...

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.230
WOMAN YOU WERE HAVING
LUNCH WITH IN TOWN?

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:43.815
- WAIT, YOU WERE IN TOWN?

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:45.817
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY HI?

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:48.820
- OH. I SAW YOU GUYS
FROM A DISTANCE AND--

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:51.614
WELL, YOU WERE HEADING OFF.

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:52.907
SO, WHO IS SHE?

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:55.743
- THE CRAZY WOODS LADY?
-MOM ALMOST RAN HER OVER.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.371
- Angela: MOM IS
A TERRIBLE DRIVER.

01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:00.290
- YEAH. NOT AS BAD AS MAYA.

01:06:00.582 --> 01:06:02.500
- IT'S BECAUSE MOM REFUSES TO
BELIEVE THAT I CAN ACTUALLY DRIVE.

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.210
AND I'M 'I6.
I HAVE A LICENSE.

01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:05.837
I'M SO SICK OF HER--

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:08.423
- ARE THEY SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER?

01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:10.383
- SHE NEVER EVEN ASKED US
IF WE WANTED TO COME HERE--

01:06:10.675 --> 01:06:12.469
- MAYA, I NEED YOU TO FOCUS!

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:15.388
I NEVER WANTED
TO LEAVE, YOU KNOW?

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.308
Maya: OKAY.

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:21.269
Angela: I'M SORRY, KID.

01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:25.315

HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS.

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:28.985
Maya: WELL, I MEAN...

01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:31.571
SHE'S A PAIN, BUTI MEAN, I
DON'T THINK IT'S INTENTIONAL.

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:36.576
- Angela: YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S INTENTIONAL?

01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:39.454
IF SHE HADN'T TEXTED ME, I WOULDN'T
HAVE KNOWN WHERE YOU GUYS WERE.

01:06:41.873 --> 01:06:45.293
YOU KNOW, IF SHE WEREN'T SO
SELFISH, WE WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW.

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:47.545
--JaCk: WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS?
-Angela: NOTHING HAPPENED.

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:54.219

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:37.262
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:44.185
IT'S A TRAIL.

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:45.728
HURRY UP.

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:49.315
