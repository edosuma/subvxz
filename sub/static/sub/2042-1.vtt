01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:53.401
But what does matter is who
we are now, and what we do...

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.210
right now.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.891
You went into the maze
and you found a way out.

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:02.363
Yeah, but if I hadn't,
Alby would still be alive.

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.250
Maybe.

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.415
But I know that if he were here,

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:15.728
he would be telling you
the exact same thing.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.123
Pick your ass up
and finish what you started.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.566
Because if we do nothing...

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:26.889
then that means Alby died for
nothing, and I can't have that.
