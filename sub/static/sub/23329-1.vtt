01:13.949 --> 01:16.374
<i>Burn them! Burn them! Burn them!</i>

01:41.476 --> 01:44.454
Ms. Frank, I'd like to remind you
that I came here voluntarily.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.444
No, you came here
because your superiors will fire you...

01:47.608 --> 01:49.454
...unless I tell them to do otherwise.

01:52.738 --> 01:55.614
As you know, we are reviewing
your handling of Wonder Woman...

01:55.782 --> 01:59.912
- ...given the current controversy.
- You're gonna give her to someone else?

02:00.829 --> 02:04.504
She's a smash success
because of me. I created her.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.044
Dr. Marston,
Wonder Woman has drawn criticism...

02:07.210 --> 02:10.180
...for being full of depictions of bondage...

02:10.339 --> 02:14.845
...spanking, torture, homosexuality,
and other sex perversions.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.434
Would you say that's a fair assessment
of your work?

02:17.596 --> 02:20.850
I can see how people with a fairly limited
understanding of my work...

02:21.016 --> 02:23.735
...could arrive
at these simplistic descriptions.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.237
They'd be wrong, of course.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.691
Would you care to explain yourself?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.034
Are you normal?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.210
What is normal?

02:51.672 --> 02:54.266
Psychology is a young science at Harvard...

02:54.424 --> 02:57.974
...and here at our sister school, Radcliffe,
with you fine young ladies...

02:58.136 --> 03:01.481
...we have only just now broken away
from the philosophy department...

03:01.640 --> 03:04.314
...into our very own distinct field of study.

03:04.476 --> 03:07.150
Emotion's what we will be
studying this semester...

03:07.312 --> 03:11.067
...specifically as it relates to deception.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.122
I've invented a model of human emotion...

03:17.280 --> 03:19.453
...which will guide us
through our investigation.

03:20.826 --> 03:21.873
DISC theory.

03:22.911 --> 03:26.836
I will be testing my theory on you.

03:27.416 --> 03:32.513
I make a vow to you all
to discover the truth of who we are.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.717
And I look forward to undertaking
this adventure with you all.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.728
And students who wish to volunteer
to help assist me...

03:43.890 --> 03:47.394
...and my notable associate and wife,
Mrs. Elizabeth Marston, please...

03:47.561 --> 03:50.406
...add your names
to the sign-up sheet, thank you.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.200
Dean is insisting we give him receipts again.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.615
I don't know
why he doesn't go work in a bank.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.455
The cocksuckers denied me again.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.838
I'm smarter, more rigorous...

04:06.997 --> 04:11.878
...more accomplished than any
of the so-called "men" in this department.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.296
They will issue you a degree from Radcliffe.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.511
That degree is a load of horseshit.
You know it.

04:16.673 --> 04:20.849
It is not. It is taught by the same
professors, it has the same standards.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.729
Precisely. If it is the same work...

04:22.888 --> 04:25.812
...then why can I not receive
a PhD from Harvard?

04:25.974 --> 04:28.773
- Because I have a vagina?
- Elizabeth.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.981
Where did you hide the liquor?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.219
We will make a great discovery.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.220
We will make a great discovery...

04:56.379 --> 04:59.428
...and then they will be forced
to acknowledge us.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.227
You are very brilliant.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.229
I know.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.602
Smarter than me.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.397
I know that too.

05:21.029 --> 05:24.329
Dear, we... We can't fuck
in the laboratory like animals.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.084
Why not?

05:30.705 --> 05:32.708
I'm going to resubmit my application.

05:32.874 --> 05:36.469
I'm taking it all the way
to the board of trustees this time.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.853
I'd appreciate it if you stop drooling.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.645
She signed up to assist us.
Her application was first-rate.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.739
Look at the boys and girls circling.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.649
He's gonna do it.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.704
Her beauty gives her an advantage
over the other girls.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.911
No, you can't be serious. Her beauty?

06:05.073 --> 06:07.576
Beauty is an albatross.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.291
No, she's at war right now. See?

06:10.453 --> 06:11.955
Watch how she averts her eyes.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.084
If she makes eye contact
with that boy for too long...

06:15.250 --> 06:17.594
...he will misunderstand
and think she's interested in him...

06:17.752 --> 06:22.053
...and then when she invariably rejects
his advances...

06:22.215 --> 06:24.764
...he'll think that she's a slut.

06:25.218 --> 06:29.724
Meanwhile, the blond girl next to her
fancies the same boy.

06:30.515 --> 06:34.315
Oh, the blond girl hates our girl
with a passion...

06:34.477 --> 06:37.322
...so fierce she can barely sit there.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.660
But they both have to...

06:41.818 --> 06:45.869
...sit there, and smile, and pretend...

06:46.406 --> 06:49.535
...because that's the life they've chosen.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.295
And what have you chosen?

06:53.788 --> 06:55.290
I've chosen you.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.717
I want to study her.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.848
She'll break your heart...

07:04.007 --> 07:09.184
...leave you eviscerated in a pile
of your own expended semen and bile.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.725
- Oh, please, dear, the hyperbole.
- It wouldn't be her fault either.

07:13.308 --> 07:17.063
She'll just be surviving,
like an animal in the jungle.

07:17.228 --> 07:20.607
They're given fur and claws
and teeth to survive.

07:24.444 --> 07:28.449
- Well, then, do it.
- You won't be jealous?

07:28.990 --> 07:32.290
No, I don't experience sexual jealousy.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.547
Who am I to fight nature?

07:35.705 --> 07:38.709
I'm your wife, not your jailer.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.654
It's a lie detector.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.070
Or it would be if we could get it to work.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.239
Right now it's just a pile of crap.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.750
I'm Olive Byrne, the new teacher's assistant.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.170
Yes.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.381
Why doesn't it work?

08:20.083 --> 08:25.340
Can't determine what exactly to measure.
We need a physiological unit of analysis.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.132
Should I call you Professor Marston as well?

08:27.298 --> 08:29.892
Possibly, if Harvard would give me
a fucking PhD.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.769
- Sorry?
- Your duties are to assist...

08:31.928 --> 08:33.895
...me and my husband with our research.

08:34.054 --> 08:36.854
We keep our papers
in the filing cabinet along the wall.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.861
Please familiarize yourself
with our current research notes.

08:40.227 --> 08:43.323
- Do you have any questions?
- I have many, but I'm sure I'll manage.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.360
Oh, and if you fuck my husband,
I'll kill you.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.954
Excuse me?

08:50.113 --> 08:53.458
Look, I feel sorry for you.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.495
No, really, I... I do, it's not your fault.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.335
It's your beauty, it's like a...

09:00.540 --> 09:04.295
Well, it's like a handicap.
It's like having three legs or something.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.556
- Mrs. Marston, I...
- No, there's no need to be defensive.

09:07.714 --> 09:11.264
I'm just asking you the courtesy
of please not fucking my husband.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.099
Can you do that for me?

09:16.306 --> 09:17.899
Yes.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.777
Thank you.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.568
Now, if you wouldn't mind,
Professor Marston and I like...

09:24.731 --> 09:27.860
- ...to have coffee in the afternoon.
- Of course.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.088
...gracious lady...

09:40.246 --> 09:44.467
...the fairest of all the virgins
who live on Mount Olympus.

09:44.626 --> 09:47.004
This is for you, dear lady...

09:47.170 --> 09:50.345
...Diana the huntress, Diana the pure.

09:50.715 --> 09:54.811
I've plotted this garden for you,
gracious goddess...

09:54.969 --> 09:59.270
...a meadow where no shepherd
brings flocks to graze...

10:07.065 --> 10:10.444
Sorry to interrupt. I'm Olive Byrne,
the new teacher's assistant.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.408
Yes, hello.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.204
Mrs. Marston said
you liked coffee in the afternoon.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.913
Oh, good. You met my wife.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.413
- Yes.
- Please, sit.

10:21.579 --> 10:24.549
- Oh, no, I really should get back to...
- No, no, no, please. Sit.

10:30.046 --> 10:33.016
Well, I'm very glad you could join us.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.973
Are you all right?

10:36.136 --> 10:37.479
Yes.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.608
So tell me a little about yourself.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.062
I'm afraid there's not much to tell, really.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.444
You're engaged.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.860
Yes.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.451
So, what makes you interested
in the field of psychology?

10:57.115 --> 10:59.288
I don't know, I...

11:00.410 --> 11:03.004
The girls, my sorority sisters...

11:03.163 --> 11:07.464
...they said your lectures
were interesting, and it...

11:08.168 --> 11:10.512
- What?
- Fit in my schedule.

11:14.048 --> 11:17.393
I find the human mind fascinating. I...

11:20.763 --> 11:23.232
I'm sorry.
I don't think this was the best idea.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.360
- What is?
- I don't know why...

11:25.518 --> 11:27.191
...she would say such awful things.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.491
Excuse me.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.328
But you said you had no sexual jealousy.

11:35.486 --> 11:39.241
But I do have professional jealousy,
and the work that we're doing right now...

11:39.407 --> 11:42.877
...well, it's critical,
I can't have you panting after some coed.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.585
- Before, you said it was all right.
- I changed my mind.

11:45.747 --> 11:48.466
If you desperately want
to understand the mind of a woman...

11:48.625 --> 11:51.754
- ...you can start with that.
- You made the poor girl cry, Elizabeth.

11:57.133 --> 12:01.013
When I asked you not to fuck my husband...

12:02.013 --> 12:05.813
...I'm sorry, I didn't mean to insult you.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.228
- I've done nothing.
- No, I know, you're right.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.819
I just don't know why women and men...

12:11.981 --> 12:13.779
That's why I wanted to work for you both...

12:13.942 --> 12:16.070
...because I thought you could tell me why.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.907
I never do anything,
and yet, nobody sees me or hears me.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.043
It's just all noise and hostility and lies.

12:23.201 --> 12:26.080
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.793
I wanna learn.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.503
I admire you, I...

12:29.666 --> 12:32.465
...read your paper on the correlation
of color and emotional states.

12:32.627 --> 12:33.674
You read my paper?

12:33.836 --> 12:35.463
It's criminal
that they will not give you a degree.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.678
You know, you don't need to feed me a line.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.594
I'm not. God, what is wrong with you?

12:41.094 --> 12:44.849
She's neurotic, also compulsive.
I'd say that's accurate.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.570
Would it be possible
to get some whiskey with this?

12:51.437 --> 12:52.529
It's illegal.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.530
Come on.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.657
Where?

12:58.820 --> 13:02.666
How are you going to learn anything at all
about life if you refuse to live it?

13:08.871 --> 13:11.090
Oh, no, darling, I have to disagree with you.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.879
- Oh, surprise, surprise.
- No, Freud is full of shit.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.889
No. What would I want with a penis?

13:18.047 --> 13:20.550
Seriously, it would be exhausting
to have one organ...

13:20.717 --> 13:24.438
...constantly directing the course
of your life. Olive, do you want a penis?

13:25.555 --> 13:28.058
- No.
- Do you think that you have penis envy?

13:28.224 --> 13:30.318
I don't understand what that means, sorry.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.694
Will you stop apologizing?

13:31.853 --> 13:34.151
Do you know how many times
a minute you apologize?

13:34.314 --> 13:35.486
Sorry.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.367
Elizabeth, peach, penis envy is figurative.

13:38.526 --> 13:41.621
It means a woman experiences
an envy of the male position in the world.

13:41.779 --> 13:45.830
His dominance. His ability to penetrate
not just the woman, but...

13:45.992 --> 13:48.370
- ...life.
- Oh, penetrate life?

13:48.536 --> 13:50.209
- Yes.
- Well, that's very interesting.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.793
You should've read the book.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.380
- You do not think I...
- Then perhaps I do have it.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.717
I do envy men's position in life,
their physical strength, their entitlement.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.100
My aunt said, "A woman must not be told
how to use her freedom...

14:02.258 --> 14:04.477
...she must find out for herself."

14:04.635 --> 14:06.854
Your aunt, my dear,
is quoting Margaret Sanger.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.108
My aunt is Margaret Sanger.

14:13.603 --> 14:16.573
- The Margaret Sanger?
- I don't know her very well.

14:17.148 --> 14:20.402
My mother and her...
There are sore feelings, I think.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.945
Are you joking?

14:22.111 --> 14:23.863
Your mother is Ethel Byrne?

14:24.280 --> 14:26.658
We were very active
in the fight for women's suffrage.

14:26.824 --> 14:31.205
When she did her hunger strike
for birth control, we rallied in her support.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.123
I didn't grow up with my mother.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.213
She left and I was put in a convent school.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.137
- What, she abandoned you?
- My father was a drunk...

14:39.295 --> 14:42.515
...and wouldn't divorce her,
and she had to earn a living...

14:42.673 --> 14:45.051
...and she had the movement to think of.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.393
So, what you're saying is,
you are descended...

14:49.555 --> 14:52.730
...from two of the most famous
radical feminists in the world...

14:52.892 --> 14:56.396
...and yet you were raised by nuns?

14:58.815 --> 15:02.160
- Yes.
- I thought you were just a...

15:02.944 --> 15:04.162
What?

15:05.780 --> 15:08.955
I don't know, not that.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.798
So will you stay?

15:18.292 --> 15:19.839
Will you join us?

15:21.963 --> 15:24.887
- Yes.
- Yes! Wonderful.

15:28.594 --> 15:32.565
Dominance, inducement, submission...

15:32.723 --> 15:34.316
...and compliance.

15:34.475 --> 15:37.069
All human relationships break down
into the interplay...

15:37.228 --> 15:39.196
...between these categories of emotion.

15:39.355 --> 15:43.781
A person is most happy when they are
submissive to a loving authority.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.743
It is essential that a person submits
to an authority willingly...

15:47.905 --> 15:50.124
...that it is their idea.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.377
We get into trouble when people feel
forced to do something...

15:52.535 --> 15:57.211
...they don't want to do,
and that is merely compliance.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.376
People who comply instead of submit...

15:59.542 --> 16:03.046
...are unhappy and repressed...

16:03.212 --> 16:04.885
...and this can lead to resentment.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.344
Taken to its extremes...

16:06.507 --> 16:09.226
...it can lead to crime, war, fascism.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.854
How do you avoid compliance? It seems like...

16:12.013 --> 16:14.687
- ...that is built into most situations.
- Inducement.

16:14.849 --> 16:18.649
Inducement is the act of seducing
somebody to your way of thinking...

16:18.811 --> 16:20.609
...dominating them so completely...

16:20.771 --> 16:23.525
...that what you want is what they want...

16:23.691 --> 16:25.819
...and they love giving it to you...

16:25.985 --> 16:29.364
...and that, ladies, is the key to life,
to love, to happiness...

16:29.530 --> 16:30.657
...to peace.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.201
Women are better at inducement than men.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.680
Are you all right, Dr. Marston?

16:47.882 --> 16:49.600
Yes, I'm fine, thank you.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.479
And how did you develop this DISC theory?

16:55.097 --> 16:58.647
Well, I started to observe student life.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.363
Mating rituals and the like.

17:08.319 --> 17:11.493
- Can't believe I let you talk me into this.
- It's research.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.203
You're not allowed to be here.

17:13.366 --> 17:17.337
- I could get kicked out of the house.
- They're dressed as babies.

17:17.494 --> 17:20.339
- We're gonna be fine.
- If you're all supposed to be babies...

17:20.498 --> 17:22.045
...then do you also have to wear the diapers?

17:22.208 --> 17:24.962
- Please don't.
- Should we stay here or go over there?

17:25.127 --> 17:27.003
Please, please stay here. Please.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.674
- Just stay here.
- Okay. We'll stay here. We'll stay.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.792
Welcome, pledges...

17:59.954 --> 18:04.005
...to the AO Pi Annual Baby Party.

18:04.166 --> 18:08.046
Pledges, you will now pair off
with your assigned big sisters.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.016
Pledge Master Olive.

18:27.732 --> 18:28.950
It's okay.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.610
Honestly, I don't get all this.

18:30.776 --> 18:31.948
It's just for fun.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.489
- Are you back-talking, Pledge Sara?
- No.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.659
You aren't to speak unless you are spoken to.

18:37.825 --> 18:41.079
- I realize that. I just...
- Pledge Master Olive...

18:41.245 --> 18:42.997
...discipline your charge.

19:01.932 --> 19:05.402
Pledge Sara, on your knees.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.003
Come on.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.565
Harder.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.533
She's a baby and needs to be punished.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.744
Twenty.

21:29.330 --> 21:30.377
Stop.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.919
That's enough.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.514
Thank you, Pledge Master Olive.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.354
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Well, how'd it make you feel?

21:50.059 --> 21:52.562
She doesn't wanna talk about it, Bill.
Why harp on it?

21:52.728 --> 21:56.278
- Because she is blocked. Can't you see?
- Fine.

21:57.358 --> 21:58.985
How did it make you feel?

21:59.151 --> 22:01.870
- I'm the one asking the questions.
- Oh, why should that be?

22:04.698 --> 22:08.043
Go ahead, ask him questions.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.880
How did it make you feel?

22:12.706 --> 22:14.424
How did what make me feel?

22:17.878 --> 22:20.427
Watching me spank that girl.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.348
Excited...

22:25.052 --> 22:26.725
...repulsed...

22:27.513 --> 22:28.981
...nervous...

22:30.140 --> 22:31.858
...aroused.

22:32.017 --> 22:35.362
But my experience
as a spectator is meaningless.

22:35.521 --> 22:39.116
You actually participated. It is
your experience that is worth cataloging.

22:39.275 --> 22:42.199
How did it make you feel?

22:43.320 --> 22:45.072
- Terrible.
- What else?

22:45.239 --> 22:46.491
Ashamed.

22:48.117 --> 22:51.087
- What else?
- Nothing, nothing else.

22:51.245 --> 22:54.715
She won't tell you the truth.
Look at her. She's practically shaking.

22:54.874 --> 22:58.003
Why the hell not? This is the substance
of what we are dealing with.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.887
Because you wanting to know
is perverse, Bill.

23:01.046 --> 23:04.516
If you cannot actually have sex with her,
you'll force her to admit what?

23:04.675 --> 23:07.554
That she experiences desire,
that she was aroused?

23:07.720 --> 23:08.767
Yes, exactly.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.977
Don't talk about me
as if I were some test subject. I'm here.

23:11.140 --> 23:14.110
Then be here. You are not still in a convent.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.027
Stop defending her
like she's some wilting violet.

23:19.189 --> 23:23.911
I happen to think there might be value
to keeping one's thoughts to oneself.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.455
Bill...

23:30.910 --> 23:32.583
...when she lies, her...

23:34.830 --> 23:37.174
Her voice shakes.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.135
Wait, come here.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.090
Her hand sweats.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.133
Galvanometer skin tests
were too inconsistent.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.894
Bill, her rhythmic breathing increases.

23:49.053 --> 23:54.230
- Benussi already exhausted that avenue.
- Her heart beats faster.

23:55.643 --> 23:58.863
- Her systolic blood pressure would rise.
- Her systolic blood pressure.

23:59.021 --> 24:01.991
- You could measure that.
- Oh, you could fucking measure that.

24:02.149 --> 24:05.198
You could measure that. Oh, my God.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.747
- Think of it sooner...
- Oh, my God. We did it!

24:08.906 --> 24:12.160
<i>The link to the lie detector test
was there the whole time.</i>

24:12.326 --> 24:14.545
<i>It doesn't matter what you say
or what you think.</i>

24:16.288 --> 24:18.666
<i>Your body will always betray you.</i>

24:21.001 --> 24:23.629
Your heart pumps a record of the truth.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.766
So how did the two of you meet?

25:16.932 --> 25:21.062
Well, I'm in SAE,
and Olive is in Alpha O, so...

25:21.603 --> 25:25.824
And all the fellows had
their eyes on her, but I quizzed Mary.

25:25.983 --> 25:27.576
Mary's the AO social chair.

25:27.735 --> 25:29.863
And she told me that Olive loved begonias...

25:30.029 --> 25:32.532
...so I sent her a bouquet every day...

25:32.698 --> 25:36.498
...till she finally agreed
to take a walk with me.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.255
Smart man.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.756
So Olive tells me you were
a spy in the Great War?

25:44.918 --> 25:47.842
I spent a few years in the OSS.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.466
I shrunk soldiers' heads.

25:50.632 --> 25:53.431
- He's a hero.
- That war was not heroic.

25:53.594 --> 25:56.814
The men I saw,
they experienced unimaginable things.

25:56.972 --> 26:00.021
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- That's all right.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.774
We're gonna fix it.

26:02.936 --> 26:05.530
Path to peace is not
through finance or politics...

26:05.689 --> 26:07.817
...it is to solve
the problems of man's heart.

26:07.983 --> 26:10.657
Can't solve war
by simply studying men's feelings.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.366
Of course, you're right.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.161
Men's minds are far too limited.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.167
That's why we need women.

26:20.537 --> 26:22.084
Come on.

26:22.790 --> 26:25.418
We'll see if they'll give us all a ride.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.007
Okay.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.798
- Hey, how are you?
- Good, yourself?

26:43.060 --> 26:45.028
I haven't told Brant...

26:45.187 --> 26:48.782
...but I'm thinking about applying
for the school of journalism at Columbia.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.193
Really?

26:50.359 --> 26:53.534
Oh, well, you'll make
an excellent journalist.

26:53.695 --> 26:56.449
I'll write you a letter of recommendation.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.367
Thank you.

26:58.534 --> 27:02.129
Well, Bill and I went to grad school, law.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.585
- Is that where you met?
- Oh, no.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.625
We grew up together.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.170
I've known him my entire life.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.179
I actually came here when...

27:11.338 --> 27:14.513
...I was 5, with my parents
from the Isle of Man.

27:14.675 --> 27:17.850
It's a lovely rock
between England and Ireland.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.398
Were you always sweethearts?

27:21.557 --> 27:23.309
Off and on.

27:24.685 --> 27:25.903
When were you married?

27:26.311 --> 27:30.157
He came to visit me
at Mount Holyoke, and we...

27:30.315 --> 27:34.366
We argued forever
about Jung's reaction-time test...

27:34.528 --> 27:36.405
...and then he proposed.

27:39.241 --> 27:40.663
I said no.

27:40.826 --> 27:43.329
- When did you say yes?
- He was very determined.

27:43.704 --> 27:46.799
I said yes eventually,
and then we were married.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.085
Were you in love?

27:50.252 --> 27:52.050
Yes.

27:52.212 --> 27:53.509
Very much.

27:54.298 --> 27:56.471
What made you hesitate?

28:04.850 --> 28:08.070
I was afraid I would always be in his shadow.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.481
Then why did you say yes?

28:12.774 --> 28:15.118
Because he respects me...

28:15.986 --> 28:18.114
...and he loves me...

28:19.823 --> 28:22.372
...and he's never boring.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.669
I didn't think I'd find those things
in another man.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.674
I see you in everything you do.

28:37.341 --> 28:39.890
I think you're magnificent.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.485
Aren't they beautiful?!

29:07.788 --> 29:09.506
Professor Marston, are you ready?

29:09.665 --> 29:13.169
- Yes, Mrs. Marston, I believe I am.
- Ms. Byrne, are you ready?

29:13.335 --> 29:17.886
- Yes, Mrs. Marston, I believe I am.
- Very well. Right.

29:18.715 --> 29:21.093
Here's to the maiden voyage of the new...

29:21.260 --> 29:24.139
...and improved lie detector.

29:24.304 --> 29:26.022
Yes.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.198
Is your name...

29:38.360 --> 29:40.283
...William Moulton Marston?

29:41.530 --> 29:42.952
Yes.

29:44.283 --> 29:47.082
True. Where do you live?

29:48.120 --> 29:49.338
Louisiana.

29:51.665 --> 29:53.793
True. False positive.

29:53.959 --> 29:56.178
Who is the president of the United States?

29:56.336 --> 29:57.929
Babe Ruth.

29:59.673 --> 30:03.348
True. False positive.

30:05.095 --> 30:07.063
- It doesn't work.
- You've barely started.

30:07.222 --> 30:10.226
Babe Ruth is not the president.
It's not working.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.440
Are you sure you've hooked up
the sphygmomanometer properly?

30:12.602 --> 30:14.980
Of course I hooked up
the sphygmomanometer properly.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.241
Double-check this charge
because this connection is loose.

30:17.399 --> 30:18.776
No, leave it be, you don't...

30:18.942 --> 30:21.115
Perhaps the lies need to be more meaningful.

30:23.155 --> 30:24.327
What?

30:24.489 --> 30:27.083
Professor Marston is not invested
in whether or not...

30:27.242 --> 30:29.996
...he lives in Boston or Louisiana.

30:30.495 --> 30:33.590
It stands to reason
his blood pressure would not go up.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.880
She's right.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.306
All right.

30:53.602 --> 30:54.774
Do you love your wife?

30:57.647 --> 30:59.240
What?

31:00.692 --> 31:02.660
Do you love your wife?

31:04.571 --> 31:06.039
Yes.

31:10.952 --> 31:12.044
True.

31:19.628 --> 31:21.676
When did you first meet Ms. Olive Byrne?

31:21.838 --> 31:26.389
She volunteered to work
as a research assistant three months ago.

31:27.344 --> 31:28.391
True.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.979
Are you in love with Olive Byrne?

31:41.066 --> 31:42.613
No.

31:56.790 --> 31:59.384
Well, I guess it works after all.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.233
I don't love him.

32:21.523 --> 32:23.696
- Of course you do.
- No.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.782
Don't take me for a fool, Olive.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.821
I'm many things, but I'm not a fool.

32:27.988 --> 32:30.867
- I know that. You're brilliant.
- Don't you see? It's over.

32:31.241 --> 32:35.292
- Whatever this is, was, it's over.
- I love you.

32:43.420 --> 32:45.593
Get away from me.

32:46.256 --> 32:48.224
I'm... I'm sorry.

32:52.512 --> 32:56.358
Gather your things.
I want you out of here immediately.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.237
<i>The lie detector...</i>

33:11.781 --> 33:14.330
...it was your wife's idea, wasn't it?

33:15.869 --> 33:18.714
- Well, the systolic-blood-pressure part.
- The important part.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.796
- Elizabeth?
- She's gone.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.764
- I'm sorry if she...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

33:31.927 --> 33:36.023
<i>I met her once years ago.
When she was law clerking.</i>

33:38.225 --> 33:40.353
<i>Makes quite an impression.</i>

33:42.187 --> 33:43.314
Yes, she does.

33:45.357 --> 33:48.952
You've incorporated the lie detector test
into the <i>Wonder Woman</i> comic...

33:49.110 --> 33:51.784
...her Golden Lasso,
it forces criminals to tell the truth.

33:52.447 --> 33:53.494
That is correct.

33:53.657 --> 33:57.002
Why is Wonder Woman an Amazon?

33:57.786 --> 34:00.915
In Greek mythology, Amazons were
a powerful tribe of women...

34:01.081 --> 34:02.583
- ...who lived without men.
- Without men?

34:02.749 --> 34:04.797
It is important to me that young girls...

34:04.960 --> 34:09.716
...realize they have the power within
themselves to create their own destiny.

34:10.090 --> 34:13.514
To be president
of the United States if they want.

34:15.011 --> 34:19.858
And Wonder Woman's catchphrase
is "Suffering Sappho."

34:22.143 --> 34:25.192
Sappho is a famous poet from ancient Greece.

34:25.355 --> 34:26.652
<i>Known for her love of women.</i>

34:26.815 --> 34:30.695
<i>It is my belief that passion and emotion
between women is perfectly natural.</i>

34:30.860 --> 34:33.534
<i>Dr. Marston,
lesbianism is an emotional illness.</i>

34:33.697 --> 34:35.074
<i>As a doctor of psychology...</i>

34:35.239 --> 34:37.914
<i>...your endorsement
of this abnormal behavior...</i>

34:38.076 --> 34:41.045
...in the pages of your comic is reckless.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.292
May I take a break, please?

34:45.458 --> 34:47.460
I need to stretch my legs.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.487
- What the fuck are you doing?
- That woman has been an enemy...

35:05.645 --> 35:07.522
...of the <i>Wonder Woman</i> comic
from the beginning.

35:07.689 --> 35:11.284
She's the head of the Child Study
Association of America.

35:11.443 --> 35:15.494
Every parent in America listens
to what she has to say.

35:15.655 --> 35:17.032
I told you to smooth it out.

35:17.198 --> 35:19.792
I mean, we got politicians
sniffing around this thing.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.669
They're talking Senate subcommittees.

35:21.828 --> 35:23.796
You know what that would mean to us?

35:23.955 --> 35:26.049
You got to go in there and play ball.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.466
- And if I don't?
- Then I can't protect you anymore...

35:29.628 --> 35:30.846
...or <i>Wonder Woman.</i>

35:34.758 --> 35:36.556
<i>You've been sad since she left?</i>

35:37.677 --> 35:39.395
I'm not sad.

35:52.442 --> 35:54.536
Maybe I'm in love with her too.

35:59.199 --> 36:01.748
Or maybe I just want her because you do.

36:04.079 --> 36:07.379
What is it that attracts you to her?

36:10.210 --> 36:12.008
She is beautiful...

36:13.463 --> 36:17.514
...guileless, kind, pure of heart.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.642
And you are brilliant...

36:21.805 --> 36:24.900
...ferocious, hilarious...

36:25.892 --> 36:28.816
...and a grade-A bitch.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.745
Together, you are the perfect woman.

36:49.207 --> 36:53.508
Do you think it's possible
to love two people at the same time?

37:06.933 --> 37:09.607
What we want can never happen.

37:09.769 --> 37:11.567
- Why not?
- Because...

37:13.398 --> 37:16.026
...the world won't let it.

37:20.155 --> 37:23.000
The world can't stop us.

37:48.767 --> 37:52.271
Ms. Byrne, would you mind staying
after class, please?

37:59.486 --> 38:02.831
We've asked you here today because we are...

38:02.989 --> 38:06.289
Well, we are in something
and I don't know what it is...

38:06.451 --> 38:07.498
...but we are in it...

38:07.660 --> 38:11.585
...and I feel that I have violated
my raison d'être as a psychologist...

38:11.748 --> 38:15.423
...by running from alarming emotions...

38:15.585 --> 38:17.838
...rather than confronting them,
so here we are.

38:19.422 --> 38:24.269
We were thinking that we could confront
whatever these emotions are together.

38:25.094 --> 38:26.141
Fuck you.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.523
I'm saying,
I'm open to having sex with you...

38:28.890 --> 38:31.769
- ...if you'd like that, as is my husband.
- I'm engaged.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.612
Do you love Brant?

38:39.400 --> 38:42.245
We miss you, Olive.

38:42.403 --> 38:45.452
- We'd like to mend fences.
- Your aunt would approve.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.077
She believed in free love.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.959
Oh, crap. Very well.

38:55.124 --> 39:00.381
If you... If you love
this Brant fellow, then...

39:00.547 --> 39:02.470
Then we're happy for you.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.760
Let's... Let's forget the sex part.

39:04.926 --> 39:08.897
We can be friends, right?
Let's just all... All be... Be friends.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.193
Yes. Oh, yeah, yeah.

39:40.086 --> 39:44.842
"Olive Byrne is an exceptional student,
a quick study with a passion for learning.

39:45.008 --> 39:47.727
She has a strong work ethic, a keen mind...

39:47.886 --> 39:49.934
...an unwavering moral compass...

39:50.722 --> 39:53.191
...and a deeply instilled sense of justice."

39:56.102 --> 39:57.354
There.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.321
Thank you.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.076
Of course.

40:08.865 --> 40:11.914
I'm writing a book. It'll be called
the <i>Emotions of Normal People.</i>

40:12.076 --> 40:14.329
I think you're decidedly not normal.

40:14.996 --> 40:16.964
Who's to say?

40:17.123 --> 40:20.923
We play a sorority game where we guess
what the other person longs for.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.429
- Should we play?
- Sure.

40:24.672 --> 40:27.471
What do I long for?

40:31.471 --> 40:34.771
I think you long for an unconventional life.

40:47.737 --> 40:50.331
How about you, Brant?
What do you think Olive longs for?

40:54.285 --> 40:57.039
I think she longs for your approval.

41:00.041 --> 41:02.795
What is your intention towards Olive?

41:02.961 --> 41:04.759
- I don't understand.
- I didn't ask you.

41:04.921 --> 41:08.096
I know what your intention is,
you're rather obvious.

41:08.257 --> 41:10.885
What is your intention towards Olive?

41:12.053 --> 41:13.805
I don't understand the question.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.474
I'm not an idiot.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.893
You're filling her mind with perverse ideas.

41:18.059 --> 41:21.529
Olive is a good person with a pure heart
and you are trying to corrupt her.

41:21.688 --> 41:23.816
You cannot corrupt somebody with ideas.

41:23.982 --> 41:27.157
- It is ignorance that is corrupting.
- Do not lecture me, professor.

41:27.318 --> 41:30.367
- I am not one of your students.
- Bill, Brant, this is unnecessary.

41:30.530 --> 41:34.125
I am trying to see what you see in them,
but I'm sorry, I do not.

41:34.283 --> 41:37.287
- They're my friends.
- They're reprobate.

41:38.079 --> 41:39.297
Don't you see that?

41:39.455 --> 41:42.425
Look, Olive is not a child,
you can't control her.

41:42.583 --> 41:45.758
You can't stick a ring on her finger
and put her in a box for your mantel...

41:45.920 --> 41:47.513
...a good little woman behind her little man.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.299
I love her.

41:49.465 --> 41:51.559
And I will fight for her.

41:52.218 --> 41:54.516
Brant, please?

41:56.431 --> 41:59.105
Olive and I are to be married,
so as her future husband...

41:59.267 --> 42:02.237
...I would appreciate it
if you would confine your relationship...

42:02.812 --> 42:05.486
- ...to the classroom.
- Is this what you want?

42:08.192 --> 42:10.035
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

43:06.459 --> 43:07.927
What are you doing here?

43:10.004 --> 43:11.677
I don't know.

43:18.971 --> 43:20.598
What is your name?

43:20.932 --> 43:22.730
Olive Byrne.

43:23.267 --> 43:26.612
- That is correct. How old are you?
- Twenty-two.

43:29.023 --> 43:30.696
That is true.

43:32.068 --> 43:33.115
Why are you here?

43:34.821 --> 43:36.539
I don't know.

43:36.697 --> 43:38.324
That is true.

43:38.491 --> 43:40.289
What do you want?

43:43.412 --> 43:45.085
I don't know.

43:48.584 --> 43:49.961
That is a lie.

43:53.506 --> 43:55.099
Are you in love with Brant?

43:55.967 --> 43:57.640
Yes.

44:00.721 --> 44:02.519
That is a lie.

44:06.435 --> 44:08.563
Are you in love with me?

44:12.525 --> 44:13.902
No.

44:24.453 --> 44:25.921
Are you in love with Elizabeth?

44:30.126 --> 44:31.673
No.

44:43.347 --> 44:45.645
Do you want to have sex with me?

44:49.437 --> 44:50.939
No. No.

44:57.278 --> 44:59.702
Do you want to have sex with Elizabeth?

45:09.957 --> 45:11.379
No.

45:31.062 --> 45:32.154
Well?

45:36.567 --> 45:39.537
- Well, what?
- What do you have to say to that?

45:46.535 --> 45:48.378
I'm flattered, I suppose.

45:48.537 --> 45:51.291
For fuck's sake, Elizabeth. What do you want?

45:51.457 --> 45:55.132
One can want a great many things,
it doesn't mean they're going to happen.

46:09.976 --> 46:11.148
Olive.

46:11.310 --> 46:13.028
Olive.

46:13.479 --> 46:15.402
Olive, wait.

46:24.240 --> 46:27.494
I don't know why I let you bait me like this.

46:27.910 --> 46:29.162
I hate you.

46:29.328 --> 46:31.547
I hate you with all of my heart.

51:18.242 --> 51:19.835
Love leaders.

51:19.994 --> 51:23.669
<i>If the nature of men is
inherently violent and anarchistic...</i>

51:25.416 --> 51:29.011
...and the nature of women
is inherently loving and nurturing...

51:30.963 --> 51:33.933
...then shouldn't women be
the ones to rule the world?

51:35.801 --> 51:37.804
Wouldn't that be a more reasonable choice?

51:44.727 --> 51:45.819
But be warned, ladies.

51:45.978 --> 51:48.777
We men will not give up
our power without a fight.

51:57.156 --> 51:59.875
I wasn't expecting you until later.

52:02.036 --> 52:03.754
Are you all right?

52:05.539 --> 52:07.758
Everybody knows, Olive.

52:10.628 --> 52:13.598
You haven't even bothered being discreet.

52:17.343 --> 52:18.720
- I don't know what...
- Please.

52:20.179 --> 52:23.729
I could ask you to stop seeing them again...

52:25.809 --> 52:27.561
...but I know that you will not.

53:07.976 --> 53:09.774
We've been fired.

53:16.402 --> 53:19.156
I want to be with you.
I want to be with both of you.

53:19.321 --> 53:22.075
- Yes. Yes.
- Are you both insane?

53:22.700 --> 53:26.955
Do you not realize what has happened?
We are ruined. All of us.

53:27.121 --> 53:28.498
You will not be able to marry.

53:28.664 --> 53:31.793
You will not be able to teach.
I will not be able to do anything.

53:31.959 --> 53:33.802
What kind of a world
do you think we're living in?

53:33.961 --> 53:37.886
- We are in love.
- We cannot be in love.

53:38.048 --> 53:40.802
- It's unorthodox, sure, but it's...
- It's preposterous.

53:40.968 --> 53:45.474
It is a fantasy,
and we have to live in reality.

53:45.639 --> 53:50.236
And in this world and these lives, love...

53:50.394 --> 53:53.273
- ...it doesn't matter.
- I don't believe that.

53:54.148 --> 53:56.401
Well, then you're a fool.

53:56.567 --> 54:00.413
A stupid, simpering dilettante.

54:04.158 --> 54:05.250
I'm pregnant.

54:08.996 --> 54:10.043
<i>Dr. Marston?</i>

54:14.793 --> 54:16.340
- Sorry. What?
- You were saying that Wonder Woman...

54:16.503 --> 54:19.382
...leaves Paradise Island
and enters man's world.

54:19.548 --> 54:21.676
That's what you call it, right? Man's world.

54:22.342 --> 54:23.514
Yes.

54:27.973 --> 54:30.692
We don't even have enough money
to pay for the electricity.

54:30.851 --> 54:32.774
We still have some money coming in
from my book sales.

54:32.936 --> 54:35.439
Oh, all five of them?

54:36.023 --> 54:40.779
I'm sorry, dear, but nobody gives a shit
about DISC theory.

54:42.863 --> 54:45.787
What about you? You're here now.
You can pull your weight.

54:45.949 --> 54:48.077
- She's pregnant.
- Obviously.

54:48.243 --> 54:51.167
- You said it was all right if I stayed.
- As if I had a choice.

54:51.330 --> 54:52.798
- Then I'll go.
- No.

54:52.956 --> 54:55.459
What about your famous feminist aunt?
She's rich.

54:57.753 --> 55:01.348
She's worried that any association
with our situation...

55:01.507 --> 55:03.885
...would be bad for the movement.

55:04.051 --> 55:05.724
What a bitch.

55:07.930 --> 55:10.058
I read in the paper
the Keelers are making money...

55:10.224 --> 55:11.942
...selling the lie detector machine.

55:12.100 --> 55:13.818
Perhaps we could do the same.

55:13.977 --> 55:17.231
That's an excellent idea, Olive.
Perhaps Bill should have patented it.

55:17.397 --> 55:20.742
Science is for everybody,
for the greater good.

55:20.901 --> 55:21.993
I was right to publish.

55:22.152 --> 55:25.452
- The greater good won't feed your child.
- It's your child also.

55:25.614 --> 55:28.163
- You'd be responsible too if you...
- What? Had a dick?

55:28.325 --> 55:30.293
You know what I mean.

55:48.595 --> 55:50.142
Olive.

56:30.137 --> 56:32.640
- How many words a minute do you type?
- Seventy-five.

56:32.806 --> 56:35.104
- Can you take dictation?
- Well, I can learn.

56:35.267 --> 56:37.770
It's just that there are
spurious rumors out there...

56:37.936 --> 56:40.064
...maligning my reputation.

56:40.230 --> 56:44.781
There has been talk of some
improprieties while you were at Radcliffe.

56:44.943 --> 56:46.786
You have a degree in law
from Boston University...

56:46.945 --> 56:49.448
...and a master's degree
in psychology from Radcliffe.

56:49.615 --> 56:51.242
Harvard.

56:51.950 --> 56:56.296
- And are you all still together?
- That won't get in the way, will it?

56:56.455 --> 56:58.958
I don't see how my personal life
is anyone's business.

56:59.124 --> 57:01.548
It's time to move on, Bill.

57:01.919 --> 57:04.513
You don't think you're too good
for this line of work?

57:06.465 --> 57:07.887
No.

57:39.706 --> 57:41.754
I want him to grow up with a family.

57:46.088 --> 57:47.715
I want more for him.

57:48.757 --> 57:50.930
More than I had.

57:58.475 --> 57:59.943
If...

58:01.144 --> 58:04.523
If we do this, we can't let it
come back on our children.

58:04.690 --> 58:07.944
We'll have to make up an explanation...

58:08.694 --> 58:10.492
...a lie...

58:12.864 --> 58:14.912
...and stick to it.

58:32.884 --> 58:35.012
<i>Wonder Woman has a secret identity.</i>

58:35.178 --> 58:36.680
- Yes, she does.
- Why is that?

58:36.847 --> 58:40.317
She has to hide her true self
from man's world.

58:41.143 --> 58:42.816
Hi, I'm Molly Stewart from across the street.

58:44.187 --> 58:46.281
- I wanted to come over and say hello.
- Hello.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.192
It was silly that you've been living here...

58:48.358 --> 58:51.453
...for over a week and we haven't
been properly introduced.

58:51.611 --> 58:52.783
Are you Mrs. Marston?

58:52.946 --> 58:54.698
No, I'm Mrs. Marston, hello.

58:54.865 --> 58:57.539
Hello. And you?

58:57.701 --> 58:59.920
Oh, I just live here.

59:01.288 --> 59:03.131
So Byrne is your son?

59:03.290 --> 59:05.338
He wandered over yesterday, wanting to play.

59:05.500 --> 59:08.128
No, no, Byrne's my son.
I have two sons, Donn and Byrne.

59:09.546 --> 59:12.641
My husband Richard passed away,
so the Marstons took us in.

59:12.799 --> 59:14.017
You poor dear.

59:14.176 --> 59:15.678
Pete is my boy.

59:16.178 --> 59:19.728
Well, it's been good to meet you.
I'm sure we'll see you again.

59:19.890 --> 59:22.234
- See you soon.
- Nice to meet you both.

59:22.768 --> 59:24.816
Donn, Byrne, Peter.

59:24.978 --> 59:26.571
Come on, boys.

59:26.730 --> 59:29.154
<i>Dear Aunt Margaret, things are good here...</i>

59:29.316 --> 59:31.489
<i>...and we're settling in to our new rental.</i>

59:31.651 --> 59:34.655
<i>The kids are keeping me busy,
and we're very happy here.</i>

59:34.821 --> 59:37.119
<i>I'm submitting writing samples
to publishers...</i>

59:37.282 --> 59:39.000
<i>...and hope someone bites soon.</i>

59:39.159 --> 59:40.786
Would you say she was living a lie?

59:40.952 --> 59:43.125
No, Wonder Woman assumes an alter ego...

59:43.288 --> 59:46.383
...so she can go to work
as Steve Trevor's secretary.

59:46.541 --> 59:49.886
<i>- She's a secretary?</i>
<i>- What's wrong with being a secretary?</i>

59:50.045 --> 59:52.548
Nothing's wrong with that,
but I think it's odd...

59:52.714 --> 59:56.389
...that Wonder Woman is all-powerful
and you have her hiding as a secretary.

59:57.219 --> 59:58.437
She's a modern woman.

59:58.887 --> 01:00:00.981
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:03.767
Hi, you look lovely.

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.811
- Oh, so do you.
- Hello, boys.

01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:08.856
<i>She has a career of her own,
she makes her own money.</i>

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:11.320
- Where's Bill?
- In his office.

01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:14.741
<i>She is not dependent on a man.</i>

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:23.871
"You too can be popular."

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:26.586
This one's going to sell. I'm sure of it.

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:33.881
<i>So then why the elaborate charade?</i>

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:45.476
This... This... This is for you.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.691
- For me?
- From the two of us.

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:51.990
So that you can play.

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:54.906
It's beautiful.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:58.113
Hey, kids, look at my plane.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:16.841
- You should tickle him, boys.
- Tickle him. He's very ticklish.

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.274
<i>She does it because she loves him.</i>

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.802
<i>She does it so they can be together.</i>

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.476
I think it's a girl.

01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:04.430
Really?

01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:08.896
Well, if it is, I shall name her Olive Ann.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.356
Don't cry.

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.367
Stop.

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:20.446
<i>She does it for love.</i>

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:26.876
<i>What would happen if Wonder Woman's
secret identity was revealed?</i>

01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:30.960
<i>Everything would be lost.</i>

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.095
Who's Charles Moulton?

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:41.933
That is my pseudonym.

01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:45.353
Why don't you write <i>Wonder Woman</i>
under your real name?

01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:48.311
Well, that's just my therapy practice.
It avoids confusion.

01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:51.773
It's not because most Americans have
a low opinion of comic writers?

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:54.063
I do not care what most of America thinks.

01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:55.981
Or is it something else?

01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:01.954
I wonder if you're the one
with the secret identity.

01:03:45.864 --> 01:03:47.582
Oh, good morning.

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:51.920
I'm... I'm looking for a burlesque outfit.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:55.210
For you?

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:57.880
No.

01:03:58.043 --> 01:04:00.467
My wife. For Halloween.

01:04:00.628 --> 01:04:02.050
It's a surprise.

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:04.136
What did you have in mind?

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:09.855
Something Greek?

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:17.612
How about an Amazon?

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:20.649
That's fantastic.

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:22.780
May I?

01:04:25.487 --> 01:04:29.037
They are specially made in France.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.373
I've never seen heels quite this high.

01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:35.873
And how much
would something like this go for?

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:38.667
Are you a devotee?

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:41.507
- Excuse me?
- Of the high heel.

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.513
I don't know what that means.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:46.808
Are you with the vice squad?

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:49.561
No.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:53.811
Are you an officer
of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service?

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:55.475
No.

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:01.197
My name is Charles Guyette.

01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:04.242
People call me the "G-string King."

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:06.074
Right.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:41.650
Honey, this is pornography.

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:42.985
Isn't this illegal?

01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:46.200
Yes, yes, but look closely.

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:48.828
I don't understand
what we're supposed to be looking at.

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:50.239
Okay.

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:53.533
Dominance...

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.954
...inducement, submission...

01:05:57.745 --> 01:05:58.792
...compliance.

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:04.253
This imagery is a metaphor for DISC theory.

01:06:04.419 --> 01:06:06.137
These pictures communicate in an instant...

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:09.550
...what I've spent
my entire career trying to explain.

01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:12.060
- This is what we should be doing.
- Sweetheart...

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:15.313
...this is pornography.

01:06:17.765 --> 01:06:21.019
Notice the finesse of the knots.

01:06:21.186 --> 01:06:24.110
Rope work is not an art for dullards.

01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:27.109
People come to me all the time...

01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:29.994
...lost, searching.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:33.999
They ask me why the rope, or costume...

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:36.080
...the role play.

01:06:36.534 --> 01:06:39.413
I tell them we play roles...

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:43.584
...all the time in everyday life, constantly.

01:06:45.043 --> 01:06:49.424
Out there we are bound
by much stronger chains...

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:52.013
...than the ones we use in here.

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:55.270
But the truth is...

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:59.354
...men and women...

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:01.769
...long to control...

01:07:01.935 --> 01:07:05.360
...and to be controlled.

01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:07.486
It is...

01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:09.909
...human nature.

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:14.706
Real life is full of pain
and disappointment...

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:18.414
...but fantasy, fantasy...

01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:21.458
...is possibility.

01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:24.708
Questions?

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:27.551
- Does it hurt?
- A little.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:31.055
Who says there's no pain in love?
Love is painful.

01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:35.014
We hurt the ones we love all the time
with our words, our deeds.

01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:39.181
The nature of love is pain.

01:07:57.156 --> 01:07:58.499
Would you like to try?

01:08:02.954 --> 01:08:04.376
Yeah.

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:08.301
We'll start with something simple.

01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:10.837
Please put your wrists
in front of you like this.

01:08:11.004 --> 01:08:14.429
Now, wrap the rope around as I instructed.

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:42.581
Olive, don't let him do this to you.

01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:45.330
I don't mind.

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:48.048
You...

01:08:50.917 --> 01:08:53.046
Why the fuck don't you mind?

01:08:59.344 --> 01:09:01.142
Excuse me.

01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:06.443
Of course.

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:09.319
You're the submissive.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:15.279
Please, dear, have an open mind.

01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:17.286
How much have you spent on this, anyway?

01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:20.415
- And the rest of that smut he sold you.
- It's research material.

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:21.825
When will you stop...

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:24.790
...justifying the whims
of your cock with science?

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:17.926
It's sick the way he controls that girl.

01:10:18.089 --> 01:10:20.638
You know better than her
what she does in her sex life?

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.518
- Well, he's a criminal.
- So are we.

01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:23.769
Our love is illegal.

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:27.307
What we do in the privacy
of our own home is our business.

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:20.281
- I'm getting Olive, and we're going home.
- Elizabeth.

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:32.246
What do you think?

01:11:44.884 --> 01:11:46.261
I...

01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:48.976
I know you don't approve, but I...

01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:07.744
Give me the rope.

01:12:36.435 --> 01:12:40.315
Is this what you really want?

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:55.792
Then put your hands behind your back.

01:13:22.356 --> 01:13:24.279
Are you all right?

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:04.049
- A comic book, Bill?
- Well, it's perfect.

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:08.922
I'm going to inject my ideas right
into the thumping heart of America.

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:13.476
I mean, I'll get a real artist
to draw it properly.

01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:17.514
She's an Amazon princess
that lives on an island of all women.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.023
Paradise Island.

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:21.479
And a man crash-lands on the island?

01:15:21.642 --> 01:15:24.862
- Yeah, Steve Trevor, the spy.
- And she wears a burlesque outfit.

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:26.898
Well, it's athletic.

01:15:27.064 --> 01:15:28.486
And silver bracelets.

01:15:29.233 --> 01:15:31.406
They deflect bullets.

01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:33.742
And all her friends are sorority girls...

01:15:33.904 --> 01:15:36.749
...who have spanking parties,
and everybody fights Nazis...

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:39.035
...and rides in an invisible plane?

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:40.419
Yes.

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:46.091
- What?
- Bill.

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:49.845
We love you truly, so much.

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:51.051
But nobody...

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:53.967
I say this with all the compassion
and truth in my heart.

01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:58.434
Nobody will ever publish this.

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:16.285
Yeah, so you tell that guinea, wop fuck...

01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:18.541
...he wants to get paid,
get his ass into work.

01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:22.249
Excuse me. I'm looking for a Mr. Gaines.

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:24.334
Who's asking?

01:16:24.705 --> 01:16:28.130
Dr. William Moulton Marston.
I have an 11 o'clock.

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:32.380
You have five minutes.

01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:34.715
You are the man that discovered Superman?

01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:35.929
Yup.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:39.392
You're a man of considerable taste,
which is why I've come to you first.

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:42.607
Who said anything about a fucking nun?

01:16:43.641 --> 01:16:46.895
I've created a new type
of comic-book superhero.

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:49.610
Her name is Suprema, the Wonder Woman.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:53.610
- Lady superhero?
- No ordinary lady superhero.

01:16:56.195 --> 01:17:00.075
I see Suprema as the modern-day Athena.

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:02.289
The American woman of tomorrow.

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:03.703
Yeah.

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:06.623
Superhero comics with female leads,
they flop.

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:09.341
Well, she will be different.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.845
- A new type of comic strip.
- They already tried that.

01:17:13.003 --> 01:17:14.550
Invisible Girl.

01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:16.340
- X-ray Girl.
- Excuse me.

01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:19.135
This is not a gimmick.

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:22.688
Mr. Gaines, please do not make the mistake...

01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:26.602
...of lumping me into the cesspool
of riffraff with whom you usually deal.

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.154
I am a Harvard-trained doctor
of psychology...

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:35.034
...with nearly 25 years' experience
into the analysis of human emotion.

01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:38.037
I'm also the inventor of the lie detector.

01:17:38.863 --> 01:17:40.581
No shit.

01:17:42.116 --> 01:17:46.872
<i>Suprema, the Wonder Woman</i>
will not be an ordinary comic book.

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:51.042
But instead, the start
of a powerful feminist movement.

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:54.546
She will be carefully crafted,
psychological propaganda...

01:17:54.712 --> 01:17:57.557
...based on a lifetime of research
into the human mind...

01:17:57.715 --> 01:18:01.265
...inserted into a populist medium
to further equal rights for women.

01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:03.808
You a professor?

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:07.684
I used to be, yeah.

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:10.353
I used to be a principal.

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:14.357
Well, then, as a fellow educator...

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:17.993
...you can see the potential
of this new medium.

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:21.281
Together, we can lift
the comic book out of the gutter.

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:24.826
Place it among the powerful
artistic movements of this century.

01:18:24.992 --> 01:18:27.290
Do you always lay it on so thick?

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:31.673
Suprema, the Wonder Woman?

01:18:31.832 --> 01:18:33.709
It's too wordy.

01:18:35.753 --> 01:18:39.223
Why don't you just call her Wonder Woman?

01:18:41.258 --> 01:18:43.010
Wonder Woman...

01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:46.355
Wonder Woman?

01:18:46.513 --> 01:18:47.810
Wonder Woman.

01:18:50.601 --> 01:18:52.353
I like it.

01:18:54.188 --> 01:18:55.940
<i>With war raging across Europe...</i>

01:18:56.106 --> 01:18:59.781
<i>...there's a new hero in town fighting
for our freedom, and she's a lady.</i>

01:18:59.944 --> 01:19:04.450
<i>They're calling her Wonder Woman.
She's the latest and prettiest sensation...</i>

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:07.118
<i>...in a superhero craze
that's sweeping the nation.</i>

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:17.841
<i>Sales are skyrocketing,
and she's outselling Superman.</i>

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:35.654
<i>But not everybody is as enthusiastic
about the new comic book craze.</i>

01:19:35.813 --> 01:19:36.940
We've been banned.

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:39.200
- What do you mean?
- Put on a list, banned.

01:19:39.358 --> 01:19:42.282
- Well, by who?
- By the National League of Decency.

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.287
- They're fascists.
- No, Catholics.

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:46.995
- Same difference.
- In every issue of <i>Wonder Woman...</i>

01:19:47.157 --> 01:19:51.412
...women are being whipped,
spanked, chained, bound, gagged.

01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:55.128
- We gotta cut the kinky shit by what?
- Fifty. Fifty to 60 percent.

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:58.591
Fifty to 60 percent, we gotta cut the kink.

01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:05.472
Doc, there's, like,
twice as much bondage stuff in here.

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:08.262
Three times. I tripled it.

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:21.655
Bye, Mom.

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:32.245
Hi.

01:20:32.745 --> 01:20:34.338
Sweetie, I'm late.

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.624
- I don't care.
- No, I'm late. I have to go.

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:39.214
I'm just calling because...

01:20:39.376 --> 01:20:43.301
...I woke up this morning,
and I... I felt terrible.

01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:45.888
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:35.517
<i>You don't even deny
that these images are overtly sexual.</i>

01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:37.355
<i>An erotic component is necessary.</i>

01:21:37.518 --> 01:21:39.737
How else is submission supposed
to be pleasurable?

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:01.049
I am teaching readers to submit
to a loving authority.

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:03.336
<i>And that submission is pleasurable.</i>

01:22:09.508 --> 01:22:10.885
Young boys must learn this...

01:22:11.051 --> 01:22:13.850
...if they are to grow up
respecting powerful women.

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:28.987
What is powerful about a woman
running around in a bathing suit?

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:40.835
Olive?

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:44.793
Elizabeth?

01:22:47.754 --> 01:22:49.347
Oh, dear.

01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:52.685
Oh, my God.

01:22:52.843 --> 01:22:54.095
Jesus.

01:22:54.261 --> 01:22:55.683
I'm so...

01:22:55.846 --> 01:22:58.895
I think I was... I'm so sorry.

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:10.574
- Just get it off me.
- I'm trying.

01:23:18.619 --> 01:23:20.337
Elizabeth.

01:23:35.886 --> 01:23:37.854
Oh, my God. It's Donn.

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:39.060
Donn?

01:23:39.223 --> 01:23:40.770
Sweetheart.

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:42.484
My God, your face.

01:23:42.643 --> 01:23:44.646
- What...? Did you...? Did you fall?
- No.

01:23:44.811 --> 01:23:47.314
- What happened?
- Charlie and the guys are telling lies...

01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:48.824
...about you and Mom and Dad.

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:56.908
All right. Come here. Come here.

01:23:57.366 --> 01:23:59.289
You're gonna be all right.

01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:03.330
- Hey!
- Jesus Christ, Bill.

01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:06.171
Your brat and his gang of hooligans
attacked my kid.

01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:08.176
- Watch your tone, doctor.
- Oh, really?

01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:10.759
Easy. We don't need
another school-yard brawl.

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:13.549
- I'm sorry the children got into a scuffle.
- A scuffle?

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:15.058
No easy way to say this...

01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:18.642
...but we think it would be best
if you remove the children from school.

01:24:18.804 --> 01:24:20.852
- What?
- Molly, you know us. We're friends.

01:24:21.014 --> 01:24:22.061
- Olive, stop...
- Don't.

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:25.069
I'm sorry. Your kids are a bad influence.

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:28.527
- That's not true. How can you say that?
- It's not the children's fault.

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:31.905
It's your fault.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:35.071
You're passing your life off as normal,
and it's not.

01:24:35.237 --> 01:24:37.535
You can live your life however you want.

01:24:37.698 --> 01:24:41.043
But when it comes to my kids,
I don't want them exposed to...

01:24:42.494 --> 01:24:44.246
...people like you.

01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:48.922
Elizabeth.

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:55.557
Fucking freaks.

01:24:58.802 --> 01:25:01.180
- What did you call us?
- Called you perverts.

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:06.773
- No!
- Bill!

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:09.405
- Stop it!
- Get off of him. Get off!

01:25:13.317 --> 01:25:15.285
- Violence.
- What of it?

01:25:17.029 --> 01:25:18.531
Fred!

01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:20.703
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:25:20.866 --> 01:25:24.086
Try to get up and be somewhat careful.

01:25:25.329 --> 01:25:27.923
Don't. It's not worth it.

01:25:29.499 --> 01:25:30.671
No more.

01:25:30.834 --> 01:25:34.134
Wonder Woman <i>is filled with violence...</i>

01:25:34.296 --> 01:25:37.141
<i>...torture and sadomasochism.</i>

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:45.061
You know, I was wrong to fight today.

01:25:45.515 --> 01:25:49.987
But what you must understand
is what's more important than fists.

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:52.569
It's what's in here.

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:55.735
Ideas, thoughts...

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.950
...that's more powerful than force.

01:26:00.447 --> 01:26:02.290
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

01:26:03.408 --> 01:26:04.580
Yes, sir.

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.370
Good.

01:26:10.123 --> 01:26:11.670
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:16.426
I landed a few.

01:26:45.409 --> 01:26:48.128
The kids are asleep, finally.

01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:50.255
And Bill?

01:26:50.914 --> 01:26:52.587
Him too.

01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:01.805
We can't keep doing this.

01:27:04.344 --> 01:27:06.847
Are you blaming me for what happened?

01:27:08.098 --> 01:27:10.897
- They had no right to...
- No, they did.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:12.277
They have every right.

01:27:12.436 --> 01:27:13.779
Their right to shun us...

01:27:13.937 --> 01:27:16.486
...and perhaps their right to beat us.

01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:21.036
Not because we fuck each other,
but because we're foolish enough...

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:23.618
...to think that we're better than them.

01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:27.288
I'm not a scientist.

01:27:27.993 --> 01:27:30.166
I'm a secretary.

01:27:30.328 --> 01:27:34.003
And Bill is not a psychologist.
He writes comic books.

01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:35.884
And you...

01:27:39.963 --> 01:27:42.261
I don't know what you are.

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:50.690
Please don't do this.

01:27:53.977 --> 01:27:55.820
You have to go.

01:28:20.170 --> 01:28:22.093
Please don't.

01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:25.763
I don't wanna go.

01:28:25.926 --> 01:28:27.894
It's gonna be all right. It's okay.

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:29.680
I won't get in any more fights.

01:28:29.846 --> 01:28:33.567
Sweetheart,
I told you it wasn't about that, okay?

01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:39.356
You be a big boy, okay?

01:28:45.654 --> 01:28:48.999
It's all right, Byrne.
You look after your brother, all right?

01:28:51.827 --> 01:28:54.706
- Please don't do this.
- I didn't do this.

01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:17.959
Love you, Mom.

01:30:23.501 --> 01:30:24.969
Hey, Mommy.

01:30:27.714 --> 01:30:29.967
I'll come pick them up on Sunday.

01:30:44.606 --> 01:30:47.200
<i>You gotta go to the review,
or they can shut us down.</i>

01:30:47.359 --> 01:30:50.613
- Absolutely not. This is un-American.
- I got this bitch on my ass.

01:30:50.779 --> 01:30:53.658
- I don't care.
- I'm not gonna let you sink this ship!

01:31:01.373 --> 01:31:04.377
<i>Burn them! Burn them! Burn them!</i>

01:31:10.507 --> 01:31:13.386
Look, I have explained my methodology.

01:31:13.551 --> 01:31:15.599
What troubles me is that you're trying out...

01:31:15.762 --> 01:31:19.608
...your so-called psychological experiment
on children.

01:31:19.766 --> 01:31:21.393
Children are our great hope.

01:31:21.559 --> 01:31:24.563
Do you let your children read it?
Your little girl?

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:26.777
I don't know why your wife puts up with it.

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:30.285
- This and the other woman...
- You leave my family out of it.

01:31:35.991 --> 01:31:38.540
Who are you to judge us?

01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:00.648
Are you normal?

01:32:17.323 --> 01:32:21.169
- Doctor, what is it? What's wrong?
- He's gonna be okay. Stay back.

01:32:58.573 --> 01:32:59.950
<i>Hello?</i>

01:33:02.327 --> 01:33:03.795
<i>Hello?</i>

01:33:08.541 --> 01:33:09.588
Olive?

01:34:35.295 --> 01:34:38.765
Bill, she's not coming back.

01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:40.266
She said she'd come.

01:34:49.559 --> 01:34:50.651
Sorry to be late.

01:34:54.314 --> 01:34:55.987
Thank you for coming.

01:35:03.323 --> 01:35:06.998
- Do you need help with your suitcase?
- No, no.

01:35:08.494 --> 01:35:10.167
I...

01:35:11.122 --> 01:35:13.341
I wanted to...

01:35:14.959 --> 01:35:17.804
Dear, I was wondering
if it would be possible for me...

01:35:17.962 --> 01:35:20.181
...to speak for three minutes
without you interrupting me.

01:35:23.426 --> 01:35:24.894
Sure.

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.147
Olive...

01:35:29.974 --> 01:35:33.353
...I've often thought
of what I wanted to say to you...

01:35:33.519 --> 01:35:36.113
- ...what I wished I'd said to you.
- I'm sorry, this...

01:35:36.606 --> 01:35:39.576
- This really isn't necessary.
- Please.

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:48.292
Elizabeth was wrong.
She can't live without you.

01:35:48.451 --> 01:35:50.328
- Bill, will you shut it?
- Three minutes.

01:35:50.495 --> 01:35:52.998
- Not if you're gonna misrepresent me.
- I'm dying.

01:35:53.164 --> 01:35:54.837
Not yet. You don't speak for me.

01:35:54.999 --> 01:35:58.378
- I am not. I'm speaking for myself.
- I'm sorry. I can't do this.

01:35:58.544 --> 01:36:02.299
- You asked me to come. Now, I'm going.
- Please don't go.

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:08.805
I have made a new life for myself, Bill.

01:36:08.972 --> 01:36:10.815
But are you happy?

01:36:12.517 --> 01:36:15.396
- Does it matter?
- Of course, it matters.

01:36:15.937 --> 01:36:18.281
You gave up. The both of you.

01:36:20.525 --> 01:36:22.573
I'm going to die...

01:36:22.735 --> 01:36:26.160
...and you will be left all alone
with your bitterness...

01:36:26.322 --> 01:36:28.996
...and your rage
and your knowledge that you loved her...

01:36:29.701 --> 01:36:32.955
...and she loved you,
and you threw it away for them.

01:36:33.121 --> 01:36:37.046
Our kids don't deserve to be attacked,
to be ostracized.

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:40.212
Our children are inheriting your shame.

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:43.097
Is that how you want them to live?

01:36:45.508 --> 01:36:48.182
Is that the lesson you want to teach them?

01:36:51.139 --> 01:36:52.266
Now, do you love her?

01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:03.944
- Yes.
- And have you always?

01:37:04.110 --> 01:37:05.703
Yes.

01:37:05.862 --> 01:37:07.865
So then ask her.

01:37:28.718 --> 01:37:30.265
Olive...

01:37:33.431 --> 01:37:35.399
...will you forgive me?

01:37:38.353 --> 01:37:39.900
No.

01:37:42.065 --> 01:37:44.864
- No?
- No.

01:37:45.026 --> 01:37:48.951
- You need to submit to her.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:37:49.113 --> 01:37:53.164
You cannot win every argument.
You cannot dominate all the time.

01:37:53.326 --> 01:37:55.545
- Get on your knees.
- I will not. This is absurd.

01:37:55.703 --> 01:37:58.377
- Get on your knees.
- I...

01:38:33.699 --> 01:38:36.168
Olive, please forgive me.

01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:39.376
More.

01:38:46.254 --> 01:38:48.632
Please take us back.

01:38:55.388 --> 01:38:57.982
I thought I knew everything.

01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:05.573
I thought love wasn't enough.

01:39:06.107 --> 01:39:07.529
But it...

01:39:08.067 --> 01:39:12.163
It has to. It has to be enough
because we cannot...

01:39:13.156 --> 01:39:15.284
We cannot live without you.

01:39:26.669 --> 01:39:29.798
I cannot live without you.

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:39.432
Please...

01:39:42.185 --> 01:39:44.529
...come back to us.

01:39:53.488 --> 01:39:55.661
I want a new stove.

01:39:58.576 --> 01:39:59.919
What?

01:40:00.703 --> 01:40:03.752
The one you have is ancient,
and the back burners don't work.

01:40:04.707 --> 01:40:06.550
We can get a new stove.

01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:09.713
I want you to take the kids on weekends.

01:40:10.087 --> 01:40:13.762
I have to look after them all week,
and I'd like some time to myself...

01:40:13.925 --> 01:40:16.178
...to go to the salon or read a book.

01:40:17.136 --> 01:40:19.434
- Okay.
- And change Wonder Woman's outfit.

01:40:19.597 --> 01:40:20.849
It's preposterous.

01:40:21.474 --> 01:40:23.067
There I must draw the line.

01:40:27.396 --> 01:40:30.525
I want you to love me for all of my days.

01:40:35.154 --> 01:40:36.781
All right.

01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:20.116
My name is Dr. William Moulton Marston.

01:41:20.575 --> 01:41:23.704
And I am the creator of Wonder Woman.

01:41:23.869 --> 01:41:25.746
Wonder Woman is a love letter.

01:41:26.163 --> 01:41:27.460
She is a fantasy.

01:41:27.623 --> 01:41:30.923
She comes from a distant place
where there is beauty...

01:41:31.419 --> 01:41:34.093
<i>...and justice, and respect.</i>

01:41:34.255 --> 01:41:37.600
<i>I write what I see about women I know...</i>

01:41:37.758 --> 01:41:40.102
<i>...women who are every bit as just...</i>

01:41:40.261 --> 01:41:44.107
<i>...and strong, and capable as Wonder Woman.</i>

01:41:44.265 --> 01:41:46.859
<i>Now, we can debate the length of her hemline.</i>

01:41:47.018 --> 01:41:49.362
But what is important...

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:52.865
...is the way Wonder Woman reforms criminals.

01:41:54.483 --> 01:41:56.611
She makes them tell the truth.

01:41:56.777 --> 01:41:59.371
That is what she stands for...

01:42:00.156 --> 01:42:01.749
...the truth.

01:42:02.742 --> 01:42:04.244
To you...

01:42:05.369 --> 01:42:09.124
...Wonder Woman is just a comic...

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:12.961
...but she's my life.

01:42:15.212 --> 01:42:17.089
She's my love.
