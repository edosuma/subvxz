WEBVTT

00:01.041 --> 00:03.601
It's one thing to die in combat,

00:03.761 --> 00:05.801
but to die because we've taken a
passenger on board.

00:06.161 --> 00:08.041
A foreigner... is a disgrace.

00:08.521 --> 00:10.841
- I am looking for Nathalie.
- Let her come in.

00:13.721 --> 00:15.081
That's when I told him everything.

00:15.801 --> 00:17.681
That I am Jewish.

00:18.281 --> 00:20.681
Frank... wanted to buy passports.

00:26.281 --> 00:28.521
Take the little one and leave.

00:28.601 --> 00:29.921
Frank will catch up with you later.

00:30.041 --> 00:33.521
He told the firing squad to stand down
so he could shoot the kid himself.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.201
You're making this up.

00:35.521 --> 00:37.001
A parade for King Kong.

00:37.121 --> 00:40.241
His real name is Schulz. A U-boat
Captain, returning triumphantly.

00:43.761 --> 00:47.561
We survive air raids and destroyer attacks
and then something like this happens.

00:49.001 --> 00:52.681
Fucking French whore! You do what
you're told!

01:27.281 --> 01:28.201
Come in.

01:33.201 --> 01:34.121
Miss Strasser.

01:34.721 --> 01:38.041
Thanks for reporting for duty,
despite the awful circumstances.

01:38.161 --> 01:41.201
That's Mister Brunel,
the Mayor of La Rochelle.

01:41.521 --> 01:42.561
Mister Forster, please proceed.

01:43.201 --> 01:47.041
As you well know, a German military
facility was attacked.

01:48.081 --> 01:50.201
We bemoan two dead
and several injured people.

01:51.001 --> 01:55.001
According to the Atonement Command of the
High Command, 100 citizens of La Rochelle

01:56.361 --> 01:58.001
have been chosen to
be executed in retaliation.

01:59.041 --> 02:01.601
The Mayor is to go through the lists and
cross those off the list

02:01.681 --> 02:03.641
essential to the war effort.

02:03.881 --> 02:06.921
Of course,
those gaps will have to be filled.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.001
With troublemakers, criminals, perverts.

02:10.401 --> 02:12.641
As there are no more registered Jews
and Communists.

02:13.161 --> 02:15.121
He has to explain every change
in writing.

02:15.601 --> 02:17.801
You will translate this
and hand it to me, please.

02:18.521 --> 02:21.121
Mister Brunel is being held in custody
by the French police for the time being

02:21.601 --> 02:23.081
so that none of the
hostages are tipped off.

02:23.321 --> 02:26.081
Miss Strasser, please brief
the gentlemen now.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.001
Mister Mayor,

02:29.721 --> 02:32.121
follow me.
I'll explain everything to you.

02:41.281 --> 02:43.361
I am in favor of retaliation.
With the utmost severity.

02:43.681 --> 02:45.041
But it should only hit those responsible.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.601
Otherwise we turn
into criminals ourselves.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.041
We're putting our alliances
with Vichy at risk.

02:49.801 --> 02:51.081
The entire collaboration.

02:52.841 --> 02:54.641
And that's exactly what this scum wants:

02:54.961 --> 02:56.401
to divide the French and the Germans.

02:57.401 --> 03:00.281
Find the attackers.
I will see what I can do.

04:17.761 --> 04:18.721
Other names.

04:22.761 --> 04:24.641
Do you think I'm God Almighty?

04:28.601 --> 04:31.321
These are innocent people.
And you are playing along, Pierre?

04:33.041 --> 04:36.121
Those killed during the attack
were innocent too.

04:38.721 --> 04:39.681
Come with me.

04:56.401 --> 04:57.321
Hello?

04:58.561 --> 04:59.401
Hello?

04:59.841 --> 05:01.361
Yes, patch her through.

05:02.681 --> 05:03.601
Margot?

05:06.841 --> 05:07.721
Who?

05:10.681 --> 05:11.521
I'm on my way.

05:18.041 --> 05:19.281
Is everything alright?

05:21.801 --> 05:22.881
These headaches.

05:24.361 --> 05:29.361
I just talked to the hospital
and they said I should come back.

05:29.721 --> 05:32.921
You do that. The work can wait.
Your health is much more important.

05:44.401 --> 05:46.401
- What happened?
- Come with me.

06:14.361 --> 06:15.761
We've sedated her

06:17.241 --> 06:19.001
but she was conscious briefly.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.121
That's when she said your name.

06:21.801 --> 06:22.801
And your brother's.

06:25.361 --> 06:26.361
Who did this to her?

06:26.681 --> 06:28.161
The only thing I know is
that she's injured.

06:29.321 --> 06:30.241
Seriously injured...

06:31.401 --> 06:32.441
head

06:33.201 --> 06:34.121
and lower abdomen.

06:39.041 --> 06:40.001
They were German.

06:41.921 --> 06:43.401
But we were ordered
not to talk about it.

06:47.361 --> 06:48.241
Who is she?

06:48.921 --> 06:49.761
A friend.

06:51.961 --> 06:53.001
Does she have family here?

06:54.361 --> 06:56.161
No, she's got nobody.

08:06.041 --> 08:07.041
Update.

08:07.401 --> 08:10.321
We're on course for our rendezvous,
Sir. At current speed

08:11.001 --> 08:12.401
we'll be there in 21 hours.

08:14.361 --> 08:15.601
Where's Petty Officer Maas?

08:16.081 --> 08:17.001
He's off duty.

08:17.281 --> 08:18.801
- Resting.
- Good.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.881
I'll be on the bridge.
Send him to me when he reports back.

08:41.001 --> 08:43.241
The maneuver against the corvette,
it was quite impressive, right?

08:45.081 --> 08:46.081
It was a standard engagement.

08:47.441 --> 08:49.241
The incident in the forward room
was regrettable.

08:50.521 --> 08:52.801
But overall, the crew did a good job.

08:53.601 --> 08:57.921
Look, I think a visible show
of your support for the Captain

08:58.041 --> 08:59.641
would be good for everyone.

08:59.801 --> 09:01.081
He would have chickened out again.

09:02.201 --> 09:03.681
He would have run away like a coward.

09:04.721 --> 09:06.201
Fortunately this time, it wasn't possible.

09:07.161 --> 09:08.401
Tennstedt, may I speak openly?

09:12.441 --> 09:13.441
You look tired.

09:15.161 --> 09:16.161
What are you hinting at?

09:17.361 --> 09:20.321
I'm not blind. Pervitin, these are
quite strong amphetamines.

09:20.401 --> 09:22.281
I'll help you remember something.

09:23.681 --> 09:26.241
Did you forget who helped you when
you wanted to come back?

09:26.881 --> 09:28.961
Who supported you
when these pencil pushers

09:29.001 --> 09:30.201
questioned your fitness for service?

09:30.521 --> 09:32.281
When you were boozing
as if there was no tomorrow.

09:33.161 --> 09:34.561
Who had faith in you?

09:38.521 --> 09:41.161
All I ask in return
is the same loyalty from you.

09:50.761 --> 09:52.121
You wanted to see me, Sir.

09:55.241 --> 09:57.121
The dispute between Strasser and you
has to end.

09:59.561 --> 10:01.601
I heard what he said about your
previous tour.

10:01.881 --> 10:03.121
A hospital ship was sunk?

10:03.961 --> 10:07.601
It arrived sooner than we expected.
CO Hinz felt it presented a danger to us.

10:08.121 --> 10:09.161
That's what he said anyway.

10:10.121 --> 10:11.201
And what do you think?

10:11.321 --> 10:13.521
What I think doesn't matter.
I follow orders.

10:14.641 --> 10:15.601
What about Strasser?

10:17.441 --> 10:18.321
Well...

10:19.161 --> 10:20.521
We returned to base

10:21.001 --> 10:23.561
and an hour later Captain Hinz
was arrested.

10:24.161 --> 10:26.641
Suspended pending a court martial.

10:27.041 --> 10:29.361
- You think Strasser denounced him?
- Who else?

10:30.001 --> 10:32.921
I'm an honest sailor, I'm loyal. And I
have to breathe the same air

10:33.001 --> 10:34.681
as this French bastard!

10:35.961 --> 10:36.961
And your loyalty towards me?

10:38.441 --> 10:40.561
Do I have it in the same measure
as Hinz did?

10:41.441 --> 10:42.441
Aye, Sir.

10:46.601 --> 10:49.201
I was up on watch with the First Watch
Officer when we spotted the corvette.

10:50.001 --> 10:51.561
There's something you should know...

10:52.601 --> 10:54.241
The two dead were French women.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.961
On the German side we luckily
only had casualties.

10:57.001 --> 10:59.521
Therefore, the execution won't take place
for the time being.

10:59.721 --> 11:02.641
Excuse me?
What sort of retaliation is this?

11:03.161 --> 11:05.121
The French should be in fear of us!

11:06.001 --> 11:07.281
This is the enemy we're talking about.

11:07.321 --> 11:09.561
Have you forgotten what happened
after the attack in Nantes?

11:09.801 --> 11:11.881
After the execution took place?
The workers went on strike.

11:12.201 --> 11:14.361
The war economy was paralyzed for weeks.

11:15.121 --> 11:16.641
Are you afraid?
Of a couple of workers?

11:16.801 --> 11:19.561
It's a question of perspective.
The war has to be won.

11:19.881 --> 11:21.401
We can't afford another strike,

11:21.681 --> 11:24.361
any more than your men's actions,
Captain Schulz.

11:24.561 --> 11:26.561
She was just a French whore.

11:27.201 --> 11:28.161
Charming.

11:29.681 --> 11:33.361
Perhaps a little time away from your desk
and out in the Atlantic

11:33.521 --> 11:35.921
might change your perspective.

11:37.161 --> 11:39.681
These men are German heroes!

11:40.041 --> 11:42.001
Not anymore.
Now they are criminals.

11:42.081 --> 11:43.001
Enough!

11:43.881 --> 11:45.761
We have a list with a
hundred hostages.

11:46.041 --> 11:49.401
But they will only be executed
if there's going to be another incident

11:49.601 --> 11:52.961
which the Gestapo hopefully will
prevent from happening.

11:53.201 --> 11:56.721
As discussed with the
Field Command Headquarters.

11:57.001 --> 12:01.641
I hereby order you to bring the four
sailors in question into the base

12:01.761 --> 12:04.721
where they will be kept until the
repairs to your boat have been finalized.

12:05.001 --> 12:06.281
When everything is finished and ready,

12:06.361 --> 12:09.121
you'll sail as soon as possible.
Is that clear?

12:10.521 --> 12:12.201
- Aye.
- Dismissed!

12:58.041 --> 12:59.361
What happened here?

12:59.921 --> 13:01.121
Bobby Schulz' men...

13:01.921 --> 13:02.961
they wanted to have fun.

13:03.601 --> 13:05.201
And Nathalie? The barmaid?
What happened to her?

13:05.281 --> 13:07.081
She always thought she was
so much better than anybody else.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.121
If she'd played along
nothing would have happened.

13:09.881 --> 13:11.281
But to fight them and yell

13:11.681 --> 13:13.801
after what happened at the quay.

13:14.321 --> 13:17.081
She got a dressing-down.
And we have to close up for a week.

14:37.441 --> 14:40.001
Maximilian Ludwig Tassilo von Haber!

14:47.761 --> 14:49.641
You're a highborn,

14:50.921 --> 14:52.081
Mürwik boy.

14:52.961 --> 14:54.881
I dropped out of Mürwik!

14:56.201 --> 14:57.161
Ah...

14:57.881 --> 14:59.361
And now you think
you're one of us or what?

15:00.281 --> 15:01.881
You're a cowardly bastard.

15:02.641 --> 15:05.721
Because you don't respect anything...
not God, not fate, nothing!

15:06.881 --> 15:08.361
But I know your fate.

15:09.801 --> 15:11.321
You can't run away from it!

15:15.201 --> 15:18.241
- That's for Matthias!
- That was your fault!

15:19.001 --> 15:19.961
Shut up!

15:23.761 --> 15:24.921
Thorsten!

15:25.801 --> 15:26.721
Come here, killer.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.401
Show us whose side you're on.

15:32.241 --> 15:33.281
Beat him.

15:38.921 --> 15:41.721
People like him don't give a shit
about people like us.

15:42.361 --> 15:43.801
In here, in this forward room,

15:44.281 --> 15:45.721
it's our law.

15:49.201 --> 15:51.321
Thorsten, I thought we were friends.

17:14.321 --> 17:15.841
Guards, you're dismissed!

17:28.401 --> 17:30.841
Hopefully you didn't catch the clap.

17:34.921 --> 17:35.801
Go now!

17:37.081 --> 17:37.961
Go!

17:48.681 --> 17:49.681
I'll make sure

17:50.241 --> 17:53.361
- you're fine.
- But she'll pull through, right?

17:56.161 --> 17:59.281
Anna's father, my brother, he'll return.

18:42.761 --> 18:45.561
The Field Command Headquarters
announces that

18:45.801 --> 18:47.401
the German Occupying Force declines
to exercise its right

18:47.521 --> 18:48.961
to retaliation for the time being.

18:49.241 --> 18:50.201
We expect

18:50.401 --> 18:53.601
the French people
to yield information to apprehend

18:53.881 --> 18:55.761
those responsible
for the bombing of the Naval Base.

19:00.721 --> 19:01.721
Who?

19:12.241 --> 19:13.601
That's what we tried as well.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.081
And you don't?

19:32.721 --> 19:33.641
Trotsky

19:35.761 --> 19:37.001
The Germans don't react.

19:37.561 --> 19:38.841
No arrests... nothing.

19:39.681 --> 19:41.401
Just a couple
more assholes on the streets.

19:41.641 --> 19:42.561
And what about the French?

19:44.321 --> 19:45.321
They don't react either.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.001
What now?

20:34.921 --> 20:35.881
Miss Simone.

20:38.401 --> 20:41.041
- You asked to see me?
- I've been worried about you.

20:41.321 --> 20:42.641
I was at the hospital.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.641
It took a bit longer than I thought.

20:45.561 --> 20:46.841
How can I be of service?

20:47.561 --> 20:50.641
We are interrogating the workers of
the base. One by one.

20:50.961 --> 20:53.041
No one will be shot for the time being.
Thank God.

20:54.241 --> 20:56.921
It wasn't easy. But the
Field Command Headquarters finally agreed.

20:57.001 --> 20:58.521
It's being made public as we speak.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.001
I need your help, Simone.

21:04.001 --> 21:06.441
95 French workers,
95 records of interrogation.

21:06.601 --> 21:08.881
This has to be
translated. Therefore

21:09.801 --> 21:11.441
I'd like to make a suggestion.

21:12.001 --> 21:13.641
Shall we talk about it
over dinner tonight?

21:14.921 --> 21:15.961
Let's say around 7 pm?

21:18.281 --> 21:20.001
I would value your company.

21:21.121 --> 21:22.161
7 pm it is then.

21:32.281 --> 21:34.561
We really have to watch out that he
won't get an infection.

21:36.361 --> 21:37.321
You're already sick, too.

21:39.601 --> 21:42.601
I knew a guy, engine room guy on U-711.

21:43.401 --> 21:45.401
His hand got caught in the pistons.

21:45.761 --> 21:47.001
Ripped off clean at the wrist.

21:47.721 --> 21:49.241
Then he caught gangrene.

21:49.441 --> 21:52.601
- The whole boat smelled of rotting meat.
- Spare me the details please!

21:57.441 --> 21:58.561
Will he make it home?

22:01.641 --> 22:03.161
I'd love to give you a different
answer, but...

22:10.161 --> 22:11.041
Tell me,

22:12.561 --> 22:14.121
you seem to know a lot of
U-boat stories.

22:15.681 --> 22:17.161
Well, I keep my ear to the ground.

22:18.641 --> 22:19.601
U-311?

22:21.201 --> 22:22.161
You mean Hinz?

22:27.881 --> 22:28.881
Are you in?

22:31.041 --> 22:31.961
Raise you.

22:58.681 --> 23:01.001
- That's worth more than my stake.
- True.

23:03.081 --> 23:04.161
What about that?

23:23.001 --> 23:24.561
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, yes.

23:26.001 --> 23:26.961
May I?

23:37.961 --> 23:39.001
Three Jacks.

24:00.001 --> 24:01.921
You really think I wouldn't notice
a rigged deck of cards?

24:03.241 --> 24:06.001
Thought you'd hustle a poor,
dumb African boy, did you?

24:10.761 --> 24:16.121
I'm only noticing it now...
your big nose, like Pinocchio's.

24:16.321 --> 24:17.441
It's enough!

26:38.841 --> 26:40.001
Bullshit!

26:40.241 --> 26:42.361
- I thought everyone knew.
- Hinz?

26:43.321 --> 26:44.361
Gerhard Hinz.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.241
He was Second Watch Officer on U-127.

26:46.841 --> 26:48.321
knew a guy who served with him
on a boat.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.001
Dead now, too?

26:51.041 --> 26:52.001
Unfortunately yes.

26:52.201 --> 26:55.001
Well, he said
that everyone knew.

26:55.401 --> 26:56.801
About Hinz and his young boys...

26:58.121 --> 26:59.401
And that's what he got arrested for?

27:00.201 --> 27:02.881
He got caught in a very special brothel.

27:03.561 --> 27:06.841
It got back to Dönitz and
he had to set an example.

27:07.881 --> 27:10.361
- Alright, mission completed.
- What mission?

27:10.641 --> 27:13.081
- The Captain wanted me to tell you.
- The Captain?

27:14.201 --> 27:17.001
What's the matter? Are you pissed
off that Hinz didn't fancy you?

27:19.001 --> 27:20.201
- Hey!
- You're a sweetie!

28:21.041 --> 28:22.641
Fuck the Fatherland!

28:33.361 --> 28:34.761
You'll let him get away with that?

28:36.841 --> 28:38.201
One doesn't have to react to everything.

28:41.161 --> 28:42.761
Is that written in your father's book
as well?

28:55.921 --> 28:58.721
This was the first strike, the
second will follow straight away.

29:18.921 --> 29:20.161
I have to admit

29:22.321 --> 29:24.041
there are moments
when I have doubts.

29:24.681 --> 29:25.561
What kind of doubts?

29:26.441 --> 29:27.961
About myself. My convictions.

29:29.961 --> 29:31.601
But then there are moments like this.

29:32.161 --> 29:33.361
Sitting here with you,

29:34.121 --> 29:36.081
my certainty is restored
and I feel strengthened.

29:37.241 --> 29:39.001
Look at the people
here in the restaurant.

29:40.201 --> 29:41.841
Decent people. Reliable.

29:43.601 --> 29:44.601
Sympathetic.

29:45.361 --> 29:47.001
- Sympathetic.
- Sympathetic.

29:47.441 --> 29:48.761
The point I was making,

29:49.441 --> 29:52.441
they prove that it's right
for us to be here.

29:53.001 --> 29:54.121
In a liberated France.

29:54.321 --> 29:57.401
Liberated from communists and anarchists.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.201
Liberated from people like Monroe?

30:00.121 --> 30:02.641
The bomb at the docks fits her profile.

30:04.241 --> 30:05.561
Political conviction.

30:10.161 --> 30:12.201
Political conviction is just a cover.

30:12.841 --> 30:15.001
It's pure hate that drives these elements.

30:15.401 --> 30:17.201
- Hate?
- Hate for Germany.

30:17.721 --> 30:20.801
They see order and contentment
and seek to destroy it.

30:25.241 --> 30:26.281
Miss Simone,

30:28.041 --> 30:29.361
I'd like you to work for me.

30:30.241 --> 30:32.161
Not just temporarily but officially.

30:33.041 --> 30:34.321
As my personal translator.

30:36.361 --> 30:37.521
Criminal Inspector.

30:40.841 --> 30:44.121
Miss Strasser, may I introduce you
to Lieutenant Commander Schulz.

30:44.321 --> 30:47.561
It seems your good taste extends to
more than just food.

30:48.641 --> 30:49.721
Miss Strasser,

30:50.921 --> 30:51.801
my respects.

30:53.001 --> 30:55.081
The lobster here is excellent.

30:55.241 --> 30:57.121
So good, in fact, that I've had some sent

30:57.201 --> 30:59.681
to four men of my crew who are...
indisposed.

31:05.321 --> 31:06.241
Have a nice evening.

31:11.361 --> 31:12.281
Gentlemen...

31:13.001 --> 31:13.961
Bottoms up!

31:14.161 --> 31:15.841
Schulz' boat sails tomorrow

31:16.321 --> 31:18.561
and unfortunately Berlin
still wants its newsreel footage.

31:19.521 --> 31:21.161
Somehow I don't like Schulz.

31:21.681 --> 31:24.001
Me neither, and day by day even less.

31:25.441 --> 31:26.361
Why?

31:27.801 --> 31:30.441
He tolerates men who behave in an
un-German manner towards women.

31:31.841 --> 31:33.001
What did these men do?

31:33.801 --> 31:36.041
They badly beat up a girl in a bar.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.921
And they'll be brought to justice,
right?

31:41.521 --> 31:43.681
The woman was of low character, no
doubt. But

31:44.001 --> 31:46.201
these heroes think that
they are above the law.

31:49.641 --> 31:50.841
May I see you home?

31:51.681 --> 31:52.641
Yes, gladly.

31:54.961 --> 31:56.841
Your proposition...

31:57.961 --> 31:59.001
What do you think?

31:59.841 --> 32:01.121
Would you like to work for me?

32:01.921 --> 32:03.961
I'm glad that you appreciate my work,

32:04.721 --> 32:08.561
but I'm not sure if I'm
really qualified.

32:10.241 --> 32:11.601
- Miss Simone.
- Excuse me.

32:23.361 --> 32:26.041
- Thanks.
- To work for you...

32:26.921 --> 32:28.961
what would be
the benefits for me?

32:30.121 --> 32:31.841
Well, a higher salary,

32:32.801 --> 32:36.881
civilian clothes, your own office.
How does that sound?

32:53.401 --> 32:56.001
Gentlemen. We'll be in contact with
an American vessel shortly.

32:57.641 --> 33:00.201
I intend to ask them to take our
injured crewman on board.

33:02.001 --> 33:04.321
Sir, I have to report a major storm
coming in from the South.

33:06.241 --> 33:08.241
Let's hope we're getting it all
over and done with quickly.

33:10.321 --> 33:11.201
So...

33:17.641 --> 33:19.921
I will ask the American Captain to
take you on board.

33:22.441 --> 33:24.961
In your case, I think captivity as
a prisoner of war is your best chance.

33:27.001 --> 33:28.561
You understand, Seaman Leudl?

33:29.921 --> 33:31.161
For you, the war is over.

33:48.081 --> 33:49.401
Did you really shoot him?

33:52.121 --> 33:53.121
What are you talking about?

33:53.881 --> 33:55.601
The young sailor under your command.

33:56.841 --> 33:58.601
He was afraid and
didn't carry out an order.

34:00.441 --> 34:02.121
Did you really shoot him in the face?

34:08.001 --> 34:08.881
That's not what happened.

34:10.961 --> 34:11.961
Is that what the crew believe?

34:18.081 --> 34:19.001
And what do you believe?

34:21.761 --> 34:24.561
That we have to fire our eels.
And win this fucking war.

34:25.881 --> 34:28.121
So that I understand why
I became a cripple.

35:05.841 --> 35:06.921
You feel unwell?

35:08.761 --> 35:09.921
I need to talk to you.

35:11.521 --> 35:12.641
The American corvette...

35:14.961 --> 35:16.201
Could we have avoided the contact?

35:17.681 --> 35:19.201
An enemy ship attacked us.

35:20.601 --> 35:23.801
The entire crew, the mission,
our passenger were in danger.

35:23.881 --> 35:26.521
You were on watch duty. I want to know
if we could have avoided contact!

35:26.641 --> 35:27.601
No!

35:29.961 --> 35:30.921
Listen, it was dark.

35:32.281 --> 35:35.281
A corvette can hardly detect a U-boat.
But a U-boat can detect a corvette,

35:35.361 --> 35:36.681
unless you're blind or asleep.

35:38.121 --> 35:39.881
Courage is as beautiful as it is rare.

35:40.961 --> 35:42.641
We are at the service of the German Navy!

35:43.201 --> 35:46.001
The German Navy orders us what to do!

35:46.201 --> 35:48.401
To face the enemy, to rely on each
other... those were your words!

35:49.121 --> 35:50.801
We are on our own out here.

35:51.241 --> 35:52.721
But we hunt together.

35:53.881 --> 35:55.401
A wolf abandoning its pack

35:56.761 --> 35:57.721
will be bitten to death.

35:58.881 --> 36:00.281
- That's the law of nature.
- Enough.

36:01.161 --> 36:02.721
I expect your subordination.

36:04.721 --> 36:06.241
Just fulfill your duties,

36:07.601 --> 36:08.521
First Watch Officer.

36:12.041 --> 36:13.121
I understand my duties.

36:39.001 --> 36:40.361
They're asking for identification.

36:40.841 --> 36:42.241
Answer as agreed.

36:53.361 --> 36:54.881
You are coming with me,
Second Watch Officer.

36:55.561 --> 36:57.041
Who else of the crew
can speak English?

36:57.641 --> 36:59.521
Petty Officer Radio Strasser. His
English is quite good.

36:59.801 --> 37:00.921
He will come with us too.

37:01.561 --> 37:04.161
We don't have to give them all of
our officers on a silver plate.

39:02.761 --> 39:04.401
What's wrong with you, damn it?

39:05.121 --> 39:06.521
Have you lost your mind?

39:08.441 --> 39:09.681
Get below deck, now!

39:11.001 --> 39:12.201
You're done, Tennstedt!

39:18.401 --> 39:19.921
Chief, you're in command!

39:20.801 --> 39:23.121
If we're not back within an hour,
you sink that ship!

39:24.281 --> 39:25.201
You hear me?

39:26.801 --> 39:29.001
Did you hear me?

40:26.401 --> 40:27.641
Captain Hoffmann.

40:43.281 --> 40:45.801
You accompany him to the sick bay,
2-WO, and then return here.

46:22.841 --> 46:23.801
Strasser!

46:43.561 --> 46:44.681
They're coming back.

47:01.361 --> 47:04.121
- Full speed ahead. Set a southerly course.
- That'll take us straight into the storm!

47:04.241 --> 47:06.001
- Just do it!
- Full speed ahead.

47:06.201 --> 47:07.201
We are under imminent attack!

47:07.801 --> 47:10.601
Once we're clear, we'll set a course
back to base and complete the mission.

47:11.441 --> 47:12.721
Two eels, straight in...

47:14.721 --> 47:15.561
What?

47:15.641 --> 47:17.081
You don't want to let them get away,
right?

47:21.281 --> 47:24.001
One of my men is on board their
ship. He's injured.

47:24.201 --> 47:25.161
Fuck it.

47:27.681 --> 47:28.561
Strasser.

47:29.361 --> 47:30.521
Find him a bunk.

48:12.841 --> 48:14.281
Your Captain is a real pussy, right?

48:18.201 --> 48:19.121
Are you alright?

48:20.441 --> 48:21.321
I'm fine.

48:23.161 --> 48:24.761
We dive the second we're in that storm.

48:46.721 --> 48:47.881
Her condition has deteriorated.

48:49.361 --> 48:50.681
She is delirious...

48:51.281 --> 48:52.441
she speaks about things

48:53.281 --> 48:54.801
that one shouldn't speak about.

48:55.161 --> 48:56.521
Especially not in front of the Nazis.

48:58.721 --> 48:59.721
What about the child?

49:02.601 --> 49:04.641
I can see when a woman
has given birth recently.

49:07.641 --> 49:08.561
The child is fine.

49:10.801 --> 49:11.681
Simone,

49:13.241 --> 49:14.841
I don't think
she will make it through the night.

50:27.601 --> 50:28.681
Anna is fine.

50:31.361 --> 50:32.561
I'll take care of her.
