You'll have to chirp
a little slower.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.503
- Easy, fellas.
It's called humor.

It takes the edge

Drednok!

01:50.278 --> 01:52.780
You look... tense.

01:52.846 --> 01:56.284
- Have you seen Fugitive Zero?

01:56.350 --> 01:58.219
- Well, I can see
how you lost him.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.087
He barely fits in your hand.

02:00.154 --> 02:02.556
But I'll make sure
to keep an eye out.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.659
Uh, you may wanna ask
that thing.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.196
He looks like
he has a big mouth.

02:08.262 --> 02:11.899
If that even is a mouth.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.201
Hey-oh-oh! Woah!

02:13.267 --> 02:17.471
- Prisoner Dal R'El,
what species are you?

02:17.538 --> 02:20.408
- Wow, getting personal.
Borderline inappropriate.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.544
Okay. Let's do this.
Honestly, who knows?

02:24.412 --> 02:25.646
If you can enlighten me,

02:25.713 --> 02:27.315
it'd sure be a weight
off of my shoulders.

02:27.381 --> 02:30.318
I'd ask my co-workers,
but you banned translators

02:30.384 --> 02:31.585
to keep us from talking, so--

02:31.652 --> 02:33.020
- He's seen Zero.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.273
- [speaking Kazon language]

06:46.339 --> 06:49.409
- The Kazon apologizes
for his delay.

06:49.477 --> 06:52.312
His excuse is that he's already
given us every criminal

06:52.379 --> 06:54.715
and orphan
this side of the Delta.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.283
But to continue
this relationship,

06:56.349 --> 06:59.352
he offers this one
for half price.

[spits]
- [speaking Kazon language]

07:32.119 --> 07:35.188
- I told him if he ever
brought us one so young again,

07:35.255 --> 07:37.891
it would be him
working the mines.

07:39.893 --> 07:43.631
[speaking Caitian language]

- [purring]

07:45.966 --> 07:49.236

07:49.302 --> 07:52.239
- You may be fluent
in many tongues, Young Progeny,

07:52.305 --> 07:57.310
but only I am to speak
for Our Diviner's dealings.

07:57.377 --> 07:59.446
Do not overstep
your boundaries.

07:59.513 --> 08:02.249
- I don't understand why
my father makes me translate

08:02.315 --> 08:04.552
when you're programmed
to do just the same.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.787
- Have trust.

08:06.854 --> 08:10.457
Our Diviner has a plan for you.

08:10.524 --> 08:17.164

08:53.033 --> 08:57.805
- [speaking Vau N'Akat]

08:57.871 --> 09:01.642
- Progeny of Solum,
you may speak in Standard.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.044
I know you favor
this primitive tongue.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.513
- You summoned, Our Diviner?

09:06.580 --> 09:09.717
Did my negotiations
with the Kazon disappoint you?

09:09.783 --> 09:11.985
- You have always cared
for my Unwanted,

09:12.052 --> 09:15.022
but that isn't
why I called for you.

09:15.088 --> 09:19.226
How well do you know
this prisoner, Dal R'El?

09:19.292 --> 09:23.030
- I know his species
is... unknown.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.765
He's mildly intelligent,

09:24.832 --> 09:28.168
but his abilities... are few.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.170
He talks a lot.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.005
- I need him to talk.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.174
My advisor believes
he may be working

09:34.241 --> 09:36.810
with Fugitive Zero.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.779
How is his tolerance to pain?

09:38.846 --> 09:42.449
- Forgive me, Our Diviner.
That won't be necessary.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.985
I can get him to talk.
But I need time.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.353
- Time?

09:46.419 --> 09:49.522
Every moment Fugitive Zero
stays at large

09:49.589 --> 09:54.394
gives the Unwanted hope,
and hope has no purpose here.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.664
- I should have never
questioned you.

09:56.730 --> 10:01.434
- My Progeny, we are the last
of the Vau N'Akat,

10:01.501 --> 10:04.437
and whatever future
our people hold

10:04.504 --> 10:07.908
will be up to you.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.276
Do it your way.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.611
But if you can't
get him to talk,

10:11.679 --> 10:17.117
Drednok will use
alternative methods.

10:17.184 --> 10:20.954
- I will not fail you.

10:21.021 --> 10:27.861
That's 12-me, six-you,
not that I'm counting.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.463
- You are hiding her
from the truth of our mission.

10:30.530 --> 10:31.965
- She is not ready.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.902
She must not know
what I'm searching for.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.737
I can't have the thought
of the Federation

10:36.804 --> 10:39.572
influence her in any way.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.811
When the time is right,
she will understand why.

10:43.877 --> 10:48.481
But if this boy fails
to deliver, use your methods.

10:48.548 --> 10:51.451

10:51.518 --> 10:53.286
[light music]

10:53.353 --> 10:55.723
- [grunting]

10:55.789 --> 10:57.825
- You never give up hope,
do you?

10:57.891 --> 11:00.160
- [gasps] Who's there?
Who said that?

11:00.227 --> 11:02.696
- Just a prisoner,
like everyone else.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.832
- You speak my language!

11:04.898 --> 11:08.068
What species are you?
What sector are you from?

11:08.135 --> 11:09.569
- Does it matter?

11:09.636 --> 11:11.872
We're all trapped here
just the same.

11:11.939 --> 11:14.207
- Not me.
I'm getting outta here.

11:14.274 --> 11:19.012
- Everyone wants to escape.
But you're special.

11:19.079 --> 11:22.249
You're the only one
who still thinks he can.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.817
- Who are you?

11:23.884 --> 11:26.920
- Just someone curious
who needs a little hope.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.056
- [gasps]

11:29.122 --> 11:31.558
- [Watchers chirping]

11:31.624 --> 11:33.994
- Ah. Hey! Okay! Okay!

11:34.061 --> 11:36.363
Easy, tripod!

11:36.429 --> 11:38.866
Wait.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.533
Who was I just talking to?
[screams]

11:40.600 --> 11:44.738
Oh! Ow!
Okay, okay, okay.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.908
[foreboding music]

11:47.975 --> 11:54.581

11:54.647 --> 11:56.516
- [speaks alien language]

11:59.186 --> 12:06.059
* *

12:06.126 --> 12:08.829
- Tell me again
what it's like out there.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.297
- Share some
of those honey lychees,

12:10.363 --> 12:12.065
and I'll tell you stories
that'll make you feel

12:12.132 --> 12:14.835
like you're living
amongst the stars.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.536
Good to see you, Gwyn.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.672
It's nice to have someone
to chat with,

12:19.739 --> 12:21.809
even if you are my only option.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.450
- You tried to fly
a class-D loader

12:30.517 --> 12:32.652
into space.
Really?

12:32.719 --> 12:33.854
- [chewing] Truthfully,

12:33.921 --> 12:35.522
I didn't think that far ahead,

12:35.588 --> 12:36.924
but I would've figured it out.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.927
I saw my chance, so I took it.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.996
- So it was just chance
you escaped at the very moment

12:43.063 --> 12:46.166
Fugitive Zero sabotaged
the manacle antenna?

12:46.233 --> 12:48.869
- Whoa, now, hold up.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.904
Is this what this is about?

12:50.971 --> 12:53.373
You think I'd hitch my fate
to some rebel fighter?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.376
- I know you'd do anything
to get out of here.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.246
'Fess up.
You two are in cat boots.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.048

13:01.114 --> 13:02.515
- What's so funny?

13:02.582 --> 13:05.452
- "Cat boots"?
You mean "cahoots."

13:05.518 --> 13:08.788
- I refuse to be mocked
by someone of your reputation.

13:08.856 --> 13:12.325
- And, uh,
what reputation is that?

13:15.362 --> 13:17.030
- Tell me where to find
Fugitive Zero,

13:17.097 --> 13:19.199
and Our Diviner
will set you free!

13:20.000 --> 13:23.570
- Gwyn, Gwyn, Gwyn.

13:23.636 --> 13:27.975
You're a chump to think
he'll let anyone off this rock,

13:28.041 --> 13:29.709
even you.

13:29.776 --> 13:32.579
- At least I know what I am.

13:34.781 --> 13:37.750
- You want Fugitive Zero?
Tell you what:

13:37.817 --> 13:40.820
get me a ticket
outta here on that Kazon ship,

13:40.888 --> 13:43.891
and I'll tell you
everything I know about him.

13:43.957 --> 13:47.060
- Fugitive Zero isn't a "him"
or a "her."

13:47.127 --> 13:50.597
Medusans are non-corporeal.
They don't have a body.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.133
- A Medusan?
A telepath...

13:53.200 --> 13:54.667
- You know nothing.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.003
I tried to help you,

13:56.069 --> 13:57.905
but you can't even help
yourself.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.773
- Wait, wait, wait, I did talk
to Fugitive Zero!

14:00.840 --> 14:02.509
- Sure you did.
- In my cell.

14:02.575 --> 14:05.612
Someone was in my head,
asking all sorts of questions.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.883
I swear to you.
I can find Fugitive Zero.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.551
- [Watchers chirp]
- [grunts]

14:11.618 --> 14:12.819
- You have until the end
of tomorrow

14:12.886 --> 14:14.421
to locate the fugitive.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.156
If you don't,

14:16.223 --> 14:18.491
I can no longer
protect you from Drednok.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.393
- You know what he'll do to me.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.861
- Then for your own sake,

14:21.929 --> 14:25.632
I hope you come through.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.835
Fugitive Zero was last seen
in the Northwest Crevasse.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.303
I suggest you start there.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.139
- That's deep core mining!

14:32.205 --> 14:34.874
How is a guy my size
supposed to get down there?

14:34.942 --> 14:37.177
- You're crafty.
Figure it out.

14:37.244 --> 14:40.180
[dramatic music]

14:40.247 --> 14:43.250
* *

14:43.316 --> 14:44.584
- [grunts]

14:44.651 --> 14:47.220
- [growls]

14:47.287 --> 14:48.755
- [laughs]

14:48.821 --> 14:51.491
Great, goop guy.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.160
What's this?

14:53.226 --> 14:56.663
Oh!
A little safety video.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.599
Oh, there's a lot of Xs
down there.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.569
[light music]

15:02.635 --> 15:04.737
* *

15:04.804 --> 15:08.308
Okay, okay, I get it.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.344
Buddy system.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.546
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.583
I cannot be buddies with him!

15:16.649 --> 15:18.451
Lights?
Huh.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.288
Oh, what are those things for?

15:24.724 --> 15:27.460
[screaming]

15:36.803 --> 15:38.171
Ugh.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.414
[grunts]
Whoa!

15:47.480 --> 15:49.949
Hey, I know we got off
on the wrong foot,

15:50.017 --> 15:52.019
and our feet are connected,

15:52.085 --> 15:54.054
but my life is kinda
on the line,

15:54.121 --> 15:57.457
so I really need your help
to find Fugitive Zero.

15:57.524 --> 15:58.758
- [roars]

15:58.825 --> 15:59.959
- Ha!

16:00.027 --> 16:02.329
I don't know what that means,

16:02.395 --> 16:07.100
but if you see anything,
or hear voices in your head,

16:07.167 --> 16:09.636
growl at me.
You understand?

16:09.702 --> 16:11.038
- [growls]

16:11.104 --> 16:12.739
- Wait a minute,
where are your ears?

16:12.805 --> 16:14.474
Can you even hear me?

16:21.914 --> 16:24.851
[laser humming]

16:28.555 --> 16:31.424
[mischievous music]

16:31.491 --> 16:34.661
- [grunting]

16:40.467 --> 16:43.370
- Look! Look!

16:43.436 --> 16:48.175
Yes, pictures.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.410
If you help me,
I can escape!

16:50.477 --> 16:52.445
* *

16:52.512 --> 16:54.747
- [grunts]

16:55.548 --> 16:57.617
- I mean, we can escape.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.688
- [grunts]

17:01.754 --> 17:02.889
- Oh!

17:02.955 --> 17:06.593
Hey, Crater Face,
I wasn't done talking!

17:08.295 --> 17:11.564
Uh, I didn't think that was
actually gonna hit you.

17:11.631 --> 17:12.799
[laughs nervously]

17:12.865 --> 17:18.105
Okay, he's stomping.
Back off, Rocky!

17:18.171 --> 17:19.139
Whoa!

17:19.206 --> 17:22.008
- [gasps]

17:22.075 --> 17:25.011
[dramatic music]

17:25.078 --> 17:30.250
* *

17:30.317 --> 17:31.551
- [grunts]

17:31.618 --> 17:35.054
- Oh! Oh!
X! X! X!

17:43.062 --> 17:45.998
[soft music]

17:46.065 --> 17:49.369
* *

17:49.436 --> 17:52.372
You... saved my life.

17:52.439 --> 17:55.074
- [snorts]
- Ah!

17:55.142 --> 17:57.610
- [querying grunt]

17:58.478 --> 18:02.415
* *

18:02.482 --> 18:04.551
- Whoa.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.220
Where are we?

18:07.287 --> 18:09.956
What is this?
[laughs]

18:10.022 --> 18:12.859
There's so much!

18:12.925 --> 18:16.463
This alone could buy
our way onto that ship!

18:16.529 --> 18:19.899
With this much, we could buy
the entire ship!

18:19.966 --> 18:23.002
[laughing]
I can see the stars now.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.605
- [grunts]

18:28.040 --> 18:31.311
* *

18:31.378 --> 18:34.781
- Whoa.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.329
[wondrous music]

18:49.396 --> 18:53.366
* *

18:53.433 --> 18:55.535
Oh, man.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.470
- [grunts]

18:57.537 --> 18:59.639
- Would you look at this?

19:18.325 --> 19:20.360
How'd it get here?

19:20.427 --> 19:27.534
* *

19:30.603 --> 19:33.139
Where's the crew?

19:33.206 --> 19:40.179
* *

19:40.547 --> 19:42.915
- [grunts]
- You said it, big fella.

19:42.982 --> 19:48.855
* *

19:48.921 --> 19:50.657
Whoa.

19:50.723 --> 19:54.527
* *

19:54.594 --> 19:56.929
[laughs]
[gasps]

19:56.996 --> 20:03.936
* *

20:12.211 --> 20:13.580
[laughs]

20:13.646 --> 20:20.787
* *

20:27.527 --> 20:28.661
[icon beeps]

20:28.728 --> 20:30.663
[electrical whirring]

20:30.730 --> 20:33.199
[swelling orchestral music]

20:33.266 --> 20:40.206
* *

20:45.978 --> 20:48.014
What did you do?
What did you press?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.149
- [high-pitched]
I didn't press anything!

20:50.216 --> 20:52.452
I... I...

20:52.519 --> 20:54.787
I understand you.

20:54.854 --> 20:59.091
- And you're not a big fella,
you're--you're a...

20:59.158 --> 21:00.293
- What?

21:00.360 --> 21:03.463
- [laughs] Not what I thought.

21:03.530 --> 21:06.533
- What--what's your name?

21:06.599 --> 21:08.535
- Dal.
- Rok-Tahk.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.669
- Excuse me?

21:09.736 --> 21:13.239
- My name.
It's Rok-Tahk.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.308
- Nice to meet ya, kid.

21:15.375 --> 21:19.178
That thing--it's some sort
of translator.

21:19.245 --> 21:23.350
- Yeah, I know.
I'm big, not dumb.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.785
What did we find?

21:25.852 --> 21:28.621
- From the looks of it,
our ticket out of here.

21:28.688 --> 21:32.725
- How did a ship this size
get inside here?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.927
- The more important
question...

21:34.994 --> 21:37.664
[mysterious music]

21:37.730 --> 21:38.931
* *

21:38.998 --> 21:41.601
How do we get it out?

21:47.306 --> 21:49.308
- You're... Fugitive Zero.

21:49.376 --> 21:51.243
- He's a... robot?

21:51.310 --> 21:55.348
- Not a robot, nor a he or she.

21:55.415 --> 21:58.618
I am Medusan,
an energy-based life-form.

21:58.685 --> 22:01.287
- Oh.
- I built this containment suit

22:01.354 --> 22:03.289
because if any corporeal being
were to lay eyes

22:03.356 --> 22:04.957
on my true self,

22:05.024 --> 22:06.493
you would go mad.
- Oh!

22:06.559 --> 22:08.728
- You built that... really?

22:08.795 --> 22:10.963
- Try to build one
without any hands.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.164
I think I did a fine job.

22:12.231 --> 22:13.666
- Why are you following me?

22:13.733 --> 22:16.603
- You are a curious one,
Dal R'El.

22:16.669 --> 22:20.139
I used to have such hope.

22:20.206 --> 22:21.741
But then I was captured

22:21.808 --> 22:23.876
like everyone else.
[gears whirring and clicking]

22:23.943 --> 22:26.846
I was forced
to do terrible things.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.848
They used me as a weapon.
[miner grunting]

22:28.915 --> 22:30.550
But I managed to escape.

22:30.617 --> 22:33.953
Curiously, of all the minds
I could read,

22:34.020 --> 22:36.589
I couldn't see the Diviner's.

22:36.656 --> 22:40.159
I could only sense
a dark purpose.

22:40.226 --> 22:42.361
He was searching for something.

22:42.429 --> 22:45.197
- He was looking for this ship.
- [gasps]

22:45.264 --> 22:48.768
Do you have telepathic powers
too?

22:48.835 --> 22:50.269
- Not quite.

22:50.336 --> 22:53.139
But he has unwittingly found
the one thing

22:53.205 --> 22:56.275
that has eluded us all:
a way out.

22:56.342 --> 22:58.010
A reason for hope.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.812
- We can save everyone!

22:59.879 --> 23:02.582
- Don't start
packing your stones yet.

23:02.649 --> 23:06.218
If we don't keep a lid on this,
it won't save anyone.

23:06.285 --> 23:08.387
Can the three of us
get it out of here?

23:08.455 --> 23:10.690
- Three?
A ship this size requires

23:10.757 --> 23:12.024
at least 20.

23:12.091 --> 23:15.027
Or, depending on the species,
37 appendages.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.964
- That's way too many
appendages to keep this quiet.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.667
How many just to get it
off the ground?

23:20.733 --> 23:24.937
- From its state of disrepair,
we'd at least need an engineer.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.506
- That's what I was thinking!

23:26.573 --> 23:29.909
[gasps]
Maybe I'm telepathic too.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.011
- An engineer, huh?

23:32.078 --> 23:33.813
- [scatting]

23:33.880 --> 23:36.483
[grunting]

23:36.549 --> 23:38.751
Oh-oh-oh-oh, great.

23:38.818 --> 23:41.721
Mr. Pain-In-My-Tail-Butt
is back to wreck

23:41.788 --> 23:43.523
my loader again.

23:43.590 --> 23:48.094
And he's found the only thing
denser than him.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.663
- What if this
Pain-In-Your-Tail-Butt told you

23:50.730 --> 23:52.431
there's a way off this rock?

23:52.499 --> 23:55.568
- Oh, whoa!
You understand Jankom Pog?

23:55.635 --> 23:58.304
Wait, Jankom Pog
understands you?

23:58.370 --> 24:00.773
How?
- Magic.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.475
- It's a translator.
- Oh.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.410
- A magic translator.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.613
- What if we told you
we found a ship,

24:06.679 --> 24:09.415
but need your help getting it
off the ground?

24:09.482 --> 24:11.918
- [laughs]
You wanna leave?

24:11.984 --> 24:13.019
Ha-ha, ha-ha.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.854
You think it's bad down here?

24:14.921 --> 24:17.323
Out there is no picnic.
- You're right.

24:17.389 --> 24:19.258
- Sure--
- He does argue everything.

24:19.325 --> 24:21.494
- He's Tellarite.
That's what they do.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.363
You're right!
What were we thinking?

24:24.430 --> 24:27.399
We'll stay!
- Stay? Ha!

24:27.466 --> 24:29.435
You wanna chop rock
for the rest of your life?

24:29.502 --> 24:31.738
If you can get out, get out!

24:31.804 --> 24:33.606
It's not every day
you find a free ship.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.876
- He probably can't even
fix it.

24:36.943 --> 24:38.711
- How dare you!

24:38.778 --> 24:41.080
Jankom can fix everything.

24:41.147 --> 24:44.483
- But who wants an engineer
who argues all the time?

24:44.551 --> 24:48.387
- Uh, someone who values
a counter opinion

24:48.454 --> 24:51.090
that may very well
save your life.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.491
Go ahead!

24:52.559 --> 24:54.694
Surround yourself
with yes trolls.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.195
See how far that gets you.

24:56.262 --> 25:00.466
- So you're saying...
we should have you on our ship?

25:00.533 --> 25:02.802
- Like it or not,
you're stuck with me.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.704
Congratulations!

25:04.771 --> 25:08.074
You just got yourself
an engineer.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.475
[laughs]

25:09.542 --> 25:12.411
Now this is a piece of work.

25:12.478 --> 25:15.548
Can wait to take it apart
and look under the hood.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.550
- Jankom Pog, I am Zero.

25:17.617 --> 25:21.087
- I thought you'd be
more interested in the ship.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.222
- You've seen one,
you've seen 'em all.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.791
- That is an impossibility.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.926
There are millions of ships
in the galaxy.

25:26.993 --> 25:30.029
[metal clanging]
- Hey, don't hurt it.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.463
- Don't worry, Brik-brain.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.933
It's percussive maintenance.
Sorta my thing.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.403
- Can you get it up and flying?
- Of course!

25:37.469 --> 25:39.405
In one week.
- And by week,

25:39.471 --> 25:41.407
you mean end of day?

25:41.473 --> 25:43.175
- Yeah, sure.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.476
In your dreams.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.579
- End of day?
Why the hurry?

25:46.646 --> 25:49.548
- Dal already made a deal
with the Diviner's daughter.

25:49.616 --> 25:52.652
If he doesn't turn me in,
he will suffer greatly.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.320
- [sighs]
I forgot.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.655
You read minds.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.156
- Why would you lie to us?

25:57.223 --> 25:58.725
- How could I lie

25:58.791 --> 26:00.627
when we didn't even speak
the same language

26:00.693 --> 26:03.696
until I found the ship?
- You mean we found the ship.

26:03.763 --> 26:06.098
- Tail-Butt is definitely
turning us in.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.399
[dramatic music]

26:07.466 --> 26:08.300
[alien languages overlapping]

26:08.367 --> 26:10.136
- Hm.

26:10.202 --> 26:11.337
Mm.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.640
- I know it sounds
like nonsense.

26:13.706 --> 26:18.711
But every language is a window
into a new culture.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.579
It's hard to believe
how many are out there.

26:20.647 --> 26:21.814
[intense music]

26:21.881 --> 26:23.950
- [whimpers]

26:24.016 --> 26:27.286
- You really need to work
on your entrance.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.821
- Your favorite prisoner...

26:28.888 --> 26:30.422
Are you aware
of his whereabouts?

26:30.489 --> 26:31.991
- [scoffs]
Of course.

26:32.058 --> 26:35.194
He's looking for Zero
in the Northwest Crevasse.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.129
- And why isn't he there?

26:37.196 --> 26:40.399
[intense music swells]

26:40.466 --> 26:41.901
- [grunting]

26:41.968 --> 26:45.571
- Looking good, Jankom.
Seeing progress.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.640
- And just how are you helping?

26:47.707 --> 26:49.341
- Uh, motivation.

26:49.408 --> 26:51.443
Keeping morale high.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.379
- [panting]
Guys, guys!

26:53.445 --> 26:55.047
I found someone else
to come with us!

26:55.114 --> 26:56.548
- Whoa, Rok.

26:56.615 --> 27:01.287
I thought we made it clear
this was a secret operation.

27:01.353 --> 27:02.421
- [snorting]

27:02.488 --> 27:04.724
- You invited that thing?

27:04.791 --> 27:06.258
- What is that bag of spit?

27:06.325 --> 27:07.559
- He isn't a "that."

27:07.626 --> 27:09.195
I named him Murf.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.731
I can't wait to hear
what he has to say.

27:11.798 --> 27:14.300
He's such a chatterbox.
Aren't ya, Murf?

27:14.366 --> 27:16.268
- Mm-hmm.
- [chirping happily]

27:16.335 --> 27:18.637
[snorting]

27:18.705 --> 27:21.240
[squeals]
- He's probably too smart

27:21.307 --> 27:23.442
for our translators.

27:23.509 --> 27:24.811
- [gurgling]
- Ah!

27:24.877 --> 27:27.213
Ah! Oh, no, no, no, no!
No, back, back, back!

27:27.279 --> 27:29.515
No, no, no, no, no!
Get away from there.

27:29.581 --> 27:30.683
- [squealing]

27:30.750 --> 27:32.018
- Oh!
- [chirping]

27:32.084 --> 27:34.854
- At least our secret's safe
with him.

27:34.921 --> 27:36.455
- Quiet!

27:36.522 --> 27:38.825
[suspenseful music]

27:38.891 --> 27:40.760
Watchers are coming this way.

27:40.827 --> 27:41.994
- They're tracking
our monitors.

27:42.061 --> 27:44.931
- W--what'll happen
if they catch us?

27:44.997 --> 27:48.868
- You're a survivor.
Help us survive.

27:48.935 --> 27:51.503
- Jankom, get this ship ready
by end of day.

27:51.570 --> 27:53.439
And Rok, you're with me.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.307
* *

27:55.374 --> 27:56.809
Conceal the entrance.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.277
I'll keep 'em busy.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.847
* *

28:00.913 --> 28:03.049
[suspenseful music swells]

28:03.115 --> 28:06.652
Oh, Gwyn.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.755
What do I owe the pleasure?

28:08.821 --> 28:11.223
- From the looks of it,
you found enough chimerium

28:11.290 --> 28:13.726
to buy your way
onto that Kazon ship.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.561
- Gwyn, I was gonna tell you.

28:15.627 --> 28:17.997
I was just getting somewhere
on this Zero guy,

28:18.064 --> 28:19.565
but then we came across this.

28:19.631 --> 28:20.800
Honest.

28:20.867 --> 28:23.135
- Dal, if you're hiding
something...

28:23.202 --> 28:24.170
tell me.

28:24.236 --> 28:30.276
* *

28:30.342 --> 28:32.678
- I wish I knew what to say.

28:32.745 --> 28:34.413
- You've tried your way.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.447
- [grunting]

28:35.514 --> 28:37.649
- Now I'll try mine.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.952
Escort this prisoner
to work the outer rim.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.754
- You're putting me
on the surface?

28:41.821 --> 28:43.089
No one comes back from there!

28:43.155 --> 28:45.024
- He's our best chance
to find Zero.

28:45.091 --> 28:49.361
If my father knew--
- Your father gave the order.

28:49.428 --> 28:52.965
* *

28:57.069 --> 28:58.771
- They sent Dal
to the outer rim!

28:58.838 --> 28:59.839
- What?

28:59.906 --> 29:01.240
- Dal may not survive,

29:01.307 --> 29:03.910
so we have to at least consider
an alternative.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.244
But we can hope

29:05.311 --> 29:11.083
for as long as we can.

29:11.150 --> 29:16.022
- [grunts]
[machinery scraping]

29:16.088 --> 29:17.389
[grunting]

29:17.456 --> 29:19.591
[contraption whirring
and beeping]

29:19.658 --> 29:21.227
[microphone static]
- It wasn't supposed

29:21.293 --> 29:23.495
to end this way.

29:23.562 --> 29:26.032
- So this is goodbye,

29:26.098 --> 29:27.299
huh, Gwyn?

29:27.366 --> 29:29.101
You know,

29:29.168 --> 29:32.304
different circumstances,
we could've been friends.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.706
- Well,
if it's any consolation,

29:34.773 --> 29:37.309
I'll never get off
this planet either.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.478
Remember last time
in detention?

29:39.545 --> 29:42.414
You told me
about that cluster of stars.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.816
What were they called?

29:43.883 --> 29:45.751
- The Window of Dreams.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.920
How do you describe
the most beautiful thing

29:47.987 --> 29:50.189
you've ever seen?

29:50.256 --> 29:53.860
- Why'd you have
to get involved, Dal?

29:53.926 --> 29:57.363
[alarm buzzing]

29:57.429 --> 29:59.999
Every time you escape,
you lose.

30:00.066 --> 30:01.333
- Gwyn?
Can you hear me?

30:01.400 --> 30:03.102
- I can--hear fine--can you--

30:03.169 --> 30:07.806
[rumbling]

30:07.874 --> 30:09.241
- Oh, no.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.843
[dramatic music]

30:10.910 --> 30:13.245
[straining]

30:13.312 --> 30:18.117
* *

30:18.184 --> 30:20.152
No!

30:20.219 --> 30:22.454
* *

30:22.521 --> 30:27.326
No, no, no, no, no, no!

30:29.161 --> 30:32.899
* *

30:32.965 --> 30:36.702
Oh!
[monitor beeping]

30:36.768 --> 30:41.507
[panting]

30:41.573 --> 30:43.275
- Are you happy now?

30:43.342 --> 30:45.311
- Well done, Progeny.

30:45.377 --> 30:49.615
He'll lead us right
to Fugitive Zero.

30:49.681 --> 30:53.085
- A little help?
- Got my hands full, sweetie.

30:53.152 --> 30:55.021
- Who you calling "Sweetie"?

30:55.087 --> 30:56.989
- [groans]

30:57.056 --> 31:01.027
- You survived!

31:01.093 --> 31:03.729
- Of course I survived.

31:03.795 --> 31:06.298
Why do you all look
so surprised?

31:06.365 --> 31:08.935
Wait, were you gonna leave
without me?

31:09.001 --> 31:11.237
- Uh... no?

31:11.303 --> 31:12.671
- Your chance of return
was low.

31:12.738 --> 31:14.340
Our desire to leave
remained high.

31:14.406 --> 31:15.507
- I can be offended later.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.609
More important,
can the ship fly?

31:17.676 --> 31:19.211
- Of course she'll fly.

31:19.278 --> 31:20.512
But without shields,

31:20.579 --> 31:22.548
Zero will need to chart
the perfect course

31:22.614 --> 31:23.582
out of these mines.

31:23.649 --> 31:27.019
- Has anyone seen my hand?

31:27.086 --> 31:28.487
- Ugh.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.189
I'll fix the shields.

31:30.256 --> 31:33.659
You find that hand.

31:33.725 --> 31:34.660
Ah!

31:34.726 --> 31:36.195
Ugh.

31:36.262 --> 31:38.597
These shield thingies...

31:38.664 --> 31:39.898
What am I looking for, Pog?

31:39.966 --> 31:42.668
- You know, a severed line,
a loose part.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.303
Anything out of the ordinary.

31:44.370 --> 31:48.007
- So you did know
Fugitive Zero.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.841
- How did you find me?

31:49.908 --> 31:52.478
- The surge on the surface.
That was you.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.780
- Mm... busted.

31:54.846 --> 31:57.683
- I knew you were in cat boots.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.519
- Well, I wasn't,
but then I was.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.088
But then I wasn't again.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.523
- What is all of this?

32:04.590 --> 32:06.392
- Our ticket out of here.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.760
To a better life.

32:08.827 --> 32:10.296
Join us.

32:10.362 --> 32:13.132
You always wanted
to see the stars.

32:13.199 --> 32:15.601
- I tried to save you.

32:15.667 --> 32:20.639
- And now we can
save each other.

32:20.706 --> 32:22.341
- Dal.

32:22.408 --> 32:23.775
It's too late.

32:23.842 --> 32:26.912
[lasers humming]

32:26.979 --> 32:33.885
[suspenseful music]

32:35.187 --> 32:37.756
- Well done, Progeny.

32:37.823 --> 32:41.193
He led us right
to the Protostar.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.695
- You knew this ship was here?

32:43.762 --> 32:46.298
- What did you think
your father was mining for

32:46.365 --> 32:48.500
all these years?

32:48.567 --> 32:51.337
[Watchers talking indistinctly]

32:51.403 --> 32:54.340
- Ah, ah!

32:54.406 --> 32:59.111
- Dal, what're we gonna do?

32:59.178 --> 33:00.979
- Fugitive Zero.

33:01.047 --> 33:04.783
Our Diviner has great plans
for you.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.452
- [Watchers talking
indistinctly]

33:06.518 --> 33:07.786
- Search the vessel.

33:07.853 --> 33:11.057
Make sure there aren't
any more Unwanted aboard.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.991
- [squeals]

33:16.628 --> 33:19.131
[console beeping]

33:19.198 --> 33:22.601
* *

33:22.668 --> 33:24.370
- [grunts]
- Uh...

33:24.436 --> 33:25.837
What is he doing with his face?

33:25.904 --> 33:28.006
- He's telepathically sending
me a message,

33:28.074 --> 33:30.476
but since I do not agree
with his plan,

33:30.542 --> 33:32.711
I am ignoring him.

33:32.778 --> 33:35.481
He assumes his facial
distortions might sway me.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.383
- What is his plan?

33:37.449 --> 33:40.419
- Take the Diviner's daughter
hostage.

33:40.486 --> 33:42.221
- That's a terrible idea.

33:42.288 --> 33:44.190
- Or the best!

33:44.256 --> 33:45.957
Ha!

33:46.024 --> 33:47.359
- [Watcher speaking
indistinctly]

33:47.426 --> 33:50.229
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

33:50.296 --> 33:51.930
[Watcher pleading
indistinctly]

33:51.997 --> 33:54.533
- It appears we are fighting
now.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.068
Hmm. Or not.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.036
- Don't touch my friend!

33:58.104 --> 34:00.972
[heroic music]

34:01.039 --> 34:03.642
- Start the ship!

34:03.709 --> 34:06.178
- Do not let the prisoners
escape.

34:06.245 --> 34:08.480
- Ah!

34:08.547 --> 34:12.418
[ship rumbling]

34:12.484 --> 34:14.786
- Please remain calm.

34:14.853 --> 34:18.590
- Rahk Te'Tu vanu ve.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.360
* *

34:21.427 --> 34:24.330
- She's not remaining calm!

- Ah!

[dramatic music]

34:28.334 --> 34:35.474
* *

34:41.012 --> 34:42.348
- I surrender.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.882
- [grunts]

34:43.949 --> 34:47.419
* *

34:47.486 --> 34:49.721
- Do not damage my prize.

34:49.788 --> 34:54.426
- Cease fire, cease fire!

34:54.493 --> 34:57.396
[dramatic music swells]

34:57.463 --> 34:59.931
* *

34:59.998 --> 35:01.800
- Oh!

35:01.867 --> 35:04.270
Ah!

35:04.336 --> 35:10.642
* *

35:10.709 --> 35:14.980
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

35:15.046 --> 35:21.520
* *

35:21.587 --> 35:22.888
- No.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.923
- We're falling, not flying!

35:24.990 --> 35:27.025
- There's a bit
of a learning curve.

35:27.092 --> 35:29.761
- Start the ship.
Start the ship!

35:33.199 --> 35:40.105
* *

35:49.381 --> 35:50.782
- Found the right button.

35:50.849 --> 35:51.917
We should probably make a note
of it.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.285
- Go, Zero!

35:53.352 --> 35:54.986
- Yes, thank you!

35:55.053 --> 35:56.054
Go me!

35:56.121 --> 35:58.224
- No, go!

35:58.290 --> 35:59.325
Get us outta here!

35:59.391 --> 36:01.126
- [chirping excitedly]

[suspenseful music]

36:18.877 --> 36:24.250
[cheers and applause]

36:28.119 --> 36:30.522
- The little red dots are still
coming after us.

36:30.589 --> 36:32.458
Can we go any faster?

36:32.524 --> 36:33.859
- Faster?

36:33.925 --> 36:35.727
I'm flattered you think
I know what I'm doing.

36:35.794 --> 36:37.696
- Do you realize
what you're doing?

36:37.763 --> 36:39.998
- Making a series
of bad decisions.

36:40.065 --> 36:42.768
Ha-ha, ha-ha, yes.
Jankom Pog is aware.

36:42.834 --> 36:47.706
* *

36:47.773 --> 36:49.775
- Hull at 82 percent.
- Zero?

36:49.841 --> 36:51.610
- Oopsies.
- Ugh, amateurs.

36:51.677 --> 36:52.911
- I'm sorry I wasn't born
with fingers.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.413
- Let me in!
- Not until

36:54.480 --> 36:57.115
you fix those shields!

36:57.182 --> 36:59.285
- I'm not an engineer.
That's your job!

36:59.351 --> 37:00.552
- What is your job?

37:00.619 --> 37:04.022
- I thought I was captain.

37:04.089 --> 37:07.693
- Hull at 79!

37:07.759 --> 37:14.900
* *

37:15.867 --> 37:17.769
- Ah!
- Left!

37:17.836 --> 37:20.372
[engine whirring]

37:20.439 --> 37:22.874
[electric humming]

37:22.941 --> 37:25.143
No, your other left!

37:25.210 --> 37:26.878
Have you ever even flown
a ship before?

37:26.945 --> 37:28.714
- No!
Does it show?

37:28.780 --> 37:30.849
- Wall, wall!
Wall!

37:30.916 --> 37:32.884
- This will either
be spectacular

37:32.951 --> 37:35.253
or a terrible end
to our adventure.

37:35.321 --> 37:37.356
[electric humming]

37:37.423 --> 37:38.657
- Ah!

37:41.460 --> 37:43.094
[engine whirring]

37:43.161 --> 37:47.265
- Whoa!
- Spectacular!

37:50.402 --> 37:52.304
[beeping]
- Hull at--

37:52.371 --> 37:58.344
- We know, we know!
Where's Dal with those shields?

37:58.410 --> 37:59.811
- Where are we even going?

37:59.878 --> 38:02.213
- There!
Any of those drainage corridors

38:02.280 --> 38:04.282
will lead us right
to the surface.

38:04.350 --> 38:09.621
* *

38:09.688 --> 38:11.990
- [chirping excitedly]

38:12.057 --> 38:13.459
- Whoa.

38:13.525 --> 38:18.630
* *

38:18.697 --> 38:23.068
[electric humming]

38:23.134 --> 38:28.206
- I've looked forward
to this moment.

38:28.273 --> 38:31.242
* *

38:31.309 --> 38:32.644
What are you doing?

38:32.711 --> 38:35.213
- Dal needs me
to turn the ship.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.849
- Turn?
We can barely go straight!

38:37.916 --> 38:40.352
[gears whirring]

38:40.419 --> 38:42.821
- Everyone, hold on!

38:42.888 --> 38:43.789
[satellite beeping]

38:43.855 --> 38:46.291
[engine roaring]

38:46.358 --> 38:47.526
- Ah!

38:47.593 --> 38:50.128
* *

38:50.195 --> 38:51.597
[console beeping]

38:51.663 --> 38:53.198
- [screaming]

38:53.264 --> 38:56.468
We're so dead.

38:56.535 --> 38:58.036
- Come on.

38:58.103 --> 38:59.538
[straining]
Come on!

38:59.605 --> 39:06.745
* *

39:12.618 --> 39:16.187
[electric humming
and crackling]

39:19.758 --> 39:21.326
Tough break.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.429
Now bug off.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.299
- Tail-Butt actually did it.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.068
- We should probably let him
in now.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.303
[triumphant music]

39:32.370 --> 39:34.305
- Oh, yeah!

39:34.372 --> 39:36.241
Captain on the bridge!

39:36.307 --> 39:37.342
Don't say it.

39:37.409 --> 39:38.810
I see it in your eyes.

39:38.877 --> 39:39.845
You're welcome.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.147
- That's our way out!

39:47.519 --> 39:50.422
[suspenseful music]

39:50.489 --> 39:57.195
* *

39:58.597 --> 40:00.932
- Do not damage my prize.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.934
- I'm well aware.

40:03.001 --> 40:10.108
* *

40:11.910 --> 40:14.546
- What--what was that?

40:14.613 --> 40:21.520
* *

40:23.622 --> 40:25.591
[console beeping]

40:25.657 --> 40:26.925
- There goes our exit.

40:26.992 --> 40:28.860
- We're gonna crash!
Can we stop?

40:28.927 --> 40:31.162
- Unfortunately,
I haven't learned that yet.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.298
- Great, and now
we're all gonna die.

40:33.364 --> 40:34.432
- Not yet.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.601
We just gotta fire
the torpedoes.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.035
- Do we have torpedoes?

40:37.102 --> 40:38.269
- Then
the "pew-pew-pew" button.

40:38.336 --> 40:39.605
- I don't see
a "pew-pew-pew" button.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.707
- Just hit 'em all until it
goes "pew pew!"

40:41.773 --> 40:46.645
* *

40:46.712 --> 40:48.947
How good are those shields?
- Not good enough.

40:49.014 --> 40:53.351
- Prepare for impact.

40:53.418 --> 40:54.553
- Huh?

40:54.620 --> 40:56.221
[beeping]
- [squealing]

40:56.287 --> 40:59.124
- Activating phasers.

41:01.727 --> 41:04.630
[triumphant music]

41:04.696 --> 41:07.232
* *

41:07.298 --> 41:08.133
- Whoo!

41:08.199 --> 41:11.036
We got phasers, baby!

41:11.102 --> 41:18.243
* *

41:28.153 --> 41:31.289
[peaceful music]

41:31.356 --> 41:38.296
* *

41:40.566 --> 41:43.334
- Hey, you always wanted
to see the stars.

41:43.401 --> 41:44.703
Am I right?

41:44.770 --> 41:47.205
* *

41:47.272 --> 41:49.641
- [gasps]

41:49.708 --> 41:56.615
* *

41:58.984 --> 42:00.251
- Hm.

42:00.318 --> 42:01.820
- Welcome to the crew, Murf.

42:01.887 --> 42:04.155
- [coos, burps]

42:04.222 --> 42:07.425
- Okay, let's plot a course,
Zero.

42:07.492 --> 42:09.227
- Where to?

42:09.294 --> 42:10.862
- Um...

42:10.929 --> 42:13.431
yeah, whew...

42:13.498 --> 42:15.500
um...

42:15.567 --> 42:16.501
yeah.

42:16.568 --> 42:19.070
Man, there are a lot more stars

42:19.137 --> 42:20.939
than I thought.
- Let me guess:

42:21.006 --> 42:22.974
you haven't thought
that far ahead.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.475
- I'll figure something out.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.444
- Only this time...

42:26.511 --> 42:28.947
he has help.
[consoles beeping]

42:29.014 --> 42:34.052
* *

42:34.119 --> 42:36.822
- Did someone ask for help?

42:36.888 --> 42:38.857
I am Hologram Janeway,

42:38.924 --> 42:40.458
your training advisor

42:40.525 --> 42:42.894
for exploring
the greater galaxy.

42:42.961 --> 42:44.596
On behalf of Starfleet,

42:44.663 --> 42:46.031
welcome aboard.

42:46.097 --> 42:48.834
How can I be of assistance?

42:48.900 --> 42:50.101
- What is that?

42:50.168 --> 42:52.103
- I have no idea.

42:52.170 --> 42:59.277
* *

43:02.580 --> 43:05.250
[eerie music]

43:05.316 --> 43:07.452
[Watchers speaking
indistinctly]

43:07.518 --> 43:14.459
* *

43:17.595 --> 43:19.798
- [chirps]

43:19.865 --> 43:22.768
- [gasping]

43:22.834 --> 43:24.770
[coughing]

43:24.836 --> 43:27.505
Get... me...

43:27.572 --> 43:29.240
my ship!

43:32.243 --> 43:35.146
[dramatic music]

43:35.213 --> 43:42.187
