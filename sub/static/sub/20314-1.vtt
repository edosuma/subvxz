-[Bill]: What are you doing?
-Planning

00:03.834 --> 00:06.291
-For school?

00:06.333 --> 00:08.208
-Planning my sick days
this year.

00:08.250 --> 00:10.959
-Whaddya mean your sick days?
How do you know when you're
gonna be sick?

00:11.000 --> 00:15.125
-Let me explain something to
you. Teachers don't actually use
sick days for when they're sick.

00:15.166 --> 00:19.000
Sick days are for sporting
events they want to watch.
-Right.

00:19.041 --> 00:22.583
-Uh weddings, parties where
they're just drinking all
weekend.

00:22.625 --> 00:24.750
-Sure, then what do you do when
you're actually sick?

00:24.792 --> 00:27.875
-You go in and teach.
Sick. Show a movie.

00:27.917 --> 00:30.125
If you're hungover you have a
work period.

00:30.166 --> 00:32.667
You don't actually stay
home when you're sick.

00:32.709 --> 00:35.333
I dunno if that's clear, but...
-It's a lot of work.

00:35.375 --> 00:38.417
-Part of the job. For instance,
I look up, when's March Madness?

00:38.458 --> 00:41.375
-[Bill]: Right.
-I find the dates. I put in
the Thursday.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.542
'Cause the Thursday, remember
the day Thursday?
-Right.

00:43.583 --> 00:46.291
-It's all day games. Wednesday,
I gotta make a note on my
calendar.

00:46.333 --> 00:48.583
Start walking around the school
doing this.

00:48.625 --> 00:50.959
Go to the office, 'Hey guys',
'What's wrong Gerry?'

00:51.000 --> 00:53.375
'Oh, I don't know, just a
wicked headache.'

00:53.417 --> 00:55.291
Thursday, I'm going to
have a migraine.

00:55.333 --> 00:57.792
-If only you put this kind of
effort into teaching children.

00:57.834 --> 01:00.208
-Now, tomorrow I want to go
golfing. I didn't plan for this.

01:00.250 --> 01:02.125
-Right.
-So I gotta call in sick now ok?

01:02.166 --> 01:04.291
-Oh.
-So I get my mind in sick mode.

01:04.333 --> 01:07.250
So I'm like, ahhh, so I start
believing my own story.

01:07.291 --> 01:10.500
Okay, I'll call. Just give me
one sec Bill, I'm going to call.
[Phone is ringing]

01:10.542 --> 01:12.709
-[Gerry]: I do not feel well.
-[Bill]: Yeah.

01:12.750 --> 01:15.875

I don't know, I've come down
with something. Sorry Trudy.

01:26.125 --> 01:30.083
-Um, I'm not going to be in
tomorrow. Uh, my lesson
plans are in my desk.

01:30.125 --> 01:33.500
-Can I come golfing with you?

01:33.542 --> 01:36.709
-I'm just messing with you.
You can just press one and
rerecord it.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.959
-What?
[Beep]

01:39.000 --> 01:41.458
Three!
-[Recording]: Message sent,
goodbye.

01:44.291 --> 01:46.750
-Now I gotta go to work. So...

-Another free day for the
future.

I need you to take over the

02:33.125 --> 02:36.000
For the rest of year.

02:36.041 --> 02:39.083
-Wow.
Where's Coach Keenan?

02:39.125 --> 02:41.417
-He's in the hospital.
He could be gone for the year.

02:41.458 --> 02:43.583
-Oh no.
-Look, it means you're going to

02:43.625 --> 02:46.166
have to give up the junior girls
volleyball, you okay with that?

02:46.208 --> 02:48.542
-Am I okay with that?
Sir, are you kidding?

02:48.583 --> 02:50.750
This is the year they
start menstruating.

02:50.792 --> 02:53.041
And when girls are on a team
together their cycles line up.

02:53.083 --> 02:56.208
And it is a nightmare, trust me.
So yes. I'm okay giving that up.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.417
-Look you don't have
to do much.

02:58.458 --> 03:01.208
-Team hasn't lost in two years.
-They had a couple close ones
though sir.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.375
Let's be honest. I can fix that.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.583
Wow, this is a lot to take in
sir. How sick is he?

03:05.625 --> 03:07.875
Is he going to be back
next year?
-No idea.

03:07.917 --> 03:10.041
-Fingers crossed.
-What?

03:10.083 --> 03:14.333
-Like for fingers, like...
I won't let you down.

03:14.375 --> 03:16.500
Thank you.
-Don't let the kids down.

03:16.542 --> 03:19.542

this apple off on my desk.

-Are you okay?

03:43.458 --> 03:47.041
Oh my god.
-Ah, I think I chipped my tooth.

03:47.083 --> 03:50.333
-Oh my god. Yeah, I see that.

03:50.375 --> 03:52.500
That's a huge piece of
your tooth.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.458
-I guess that's why we have
so many right?

03:54.500 --> 03:56.709
-That's one way of looking
at it.
-Ah man.

03:58.750 --> 04:00.834
Looks like I'll just be eating
on this side for awhile, huh?

04:00.875 --> 04:03.417
-You could just not eat it, and
have a sandwich.

04:03.458 --> 04:05.959
-Gotta go enlighten the youth.
-Okay.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.125
-Good chat.

04:08.166 --> 04:10.291
-Alright, new season, new coach.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.500
As you know, Mr. Keenan's not
going to be with us this year,
unfortunately.

04:13.542 --> 04:17.709
But we'll continue on with the
same success that you've
had in the past.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.875
Wow! What's your name?
-Eddie, sir.

04:20.917 --> 04:23.291
-You cannot teach height.

04:23.333 --> 04:25.667
And unfortunately for
the rest of you...

04:25.709 --> 04:27.917
-Hey Coach, can I have a minute
with you and the team?

04:27.959 --> 04:32.083
-Ahh, kind of in the middle
of something, okay.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.083
That's our new guidance
counsellor.

04:37.458 --> 04:41.291
How are you?
-I'm here to offer my services
as the assistant to the coach.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.834
-Oh no, that's okay Frank.
Thank you.

04:43.875 --> 04:46.625
I'm quite capable of
handling this myself.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.792
And hey, you just started.
It's your first year here.

04:48.834 --> 04:51.000
Get settled, you don't even
know your workload yet.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.375
-Please, those kids can guidance
counsel themselves.

is something, it's a little bit
of a process.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.333
We gotta go through Callaghan,
and...

04:58.375 --> 05:00.709

he thinks it's a great idea.

05:00.750 --> 05:03.083
-And you're already. Okay.
Why not?

Mr...I don't know your
last name.

05:05.291 --> 05:07.750
-Frank. Yup.
-Just call you Frank?
Kids call you Frank.

05:07.792 --> 05:10.000
They call you by your
first name?
-It connects us.

05:10.041 --> 05:13.417
-Okay, ah, this is Coach Frank.

05:13.458 --> 05:15.709
Also, your guidance counsellor.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.959
And he will be helping.
So give me two lines.

-Ah, tomorrow actually.

-I got you a present.
-Oh, Trudy.

06:12.875 --> 06:15.542
You shouldn't have.
-Honestly, it's nothing.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.875
Oh my god, it's gorgeous.

with a layer of pudding.

-That was nice.
-Is this real pearls?

-Hey, how was your
first practice?
-Ah, it was good.

06:53.917 --> 06:57.291
Except I got this really tall
kid, Eddie who's absolutely
awful.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.500
-The giant?
-Yeah.

06:59.542 --> 07:02.375
-Well, his life expectancy
will be less, that's for sure.
But other than that.

07:02.417 --> 07:05.583
-Okay. Anyway, he's terrible.
Why'd Keenan keep him on
the team? I don't get it.

07:05.625 --> 07:08.208
-I think he likes his
enthusiasm. Kid's got pep.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.125
-Yeah, lots of kids have
enthusiasm.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.333
You don't keep them on a
varsity basketball team.

07:12.375 --> 07:15.333
-Sure you do. I mean I made all
my teams because I had
enthusiasm.

07:15.375 --> 07:18.834

you play on, Simon?

07:18.875 --> 07:22.125

Okay Gerry, do you know
how many people it takes
to put on a musical?

07:27.375 --> 07:30.917
Cast plus crew plus director
equals team.

07:30.959 --> 07:34.166
Simon, those are people that
are cut from real teams.

07:34.208 --> 07:36.542
Okay? I think I gotta cut this
kid.

07:36.583 --> 07:39.000
-That team hasn't lost a
game in two years, Gerry.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.208
You're gonna mess with
that chemistry?
-He's never gonna play.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.875
What a waste of size. He's just
gonna sit there on the bench.

having a bad day.

-This?

07:57.834 --> 08:00.417

08:00.458 --> 08:02.375
-How do you know it
was one of them?

08:02.417 --> 08:04.542
-They threatened they'd
do it weeks ago.

08:04.583 --> 08:06.750
-Well, you need to call the
police.
-Nah.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.959

same opportunities as ours.

crime?

-Yes, that's my Eddie.

08:49.417 --> 08:51.333
-Yeah, yeah.
-Well I just want to say hello.

08:51.375 --> 08:55.500
-Hello.
-And to tell you, how much I
appreciate what you do.

08:55.542 --> 08:58.250
-It's not a problem.
-A small sign of appreciation.

08:58.291 --> 09:01.083
If you don't mind.
You like steak?

09:01.125 --> 09:03.333
-Yeah.
-Yes?

09:03.375 --> 09:05.500
-Seriously?
-With bone in, the best.

09:05.542 --> 09:07.959

-Yes.
-You're giving me these steaks?

09:12.250 --> 09:14.375
-Oh yes.
-Well, thank you.

09:14.417 --> 09:17.375
-Hey, you know what?
Maybe you play Eddie.

09:17.417 --> 09:21.291
-I'm sorry, what?
-You know, play Eddie.

09:21.333 --> 09:23.875
-Yeah, he may play, sometime.
We have a really strong team.

09:23.917 --> 09:26.208
It's hard to get him in so...
-The last coach I no like.

09:26.250 --> 09:29.542
He no play Eddie. Well now
he's out of picture, so...

09:29.583 --> 09:31.583
I come to you. Pozhaluysta.
-[Gerry]: Yeah.

09:31.625 --> 09:34.583
I never see my boy play.
-You've never seen him play?

09:34.625 --> 09:39.166
Well, I always try to get
everybody in, no promises but...

09:39.208 --> 09:43.208
-Oh, I almost forgot. My wife
she appreciate your coaching
too.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.291
-Oh thank you. Oh.
-You like merlot?

09:46.333 --> 09:48.375
-Oh yeah, wow.
-You look like merlot man.

09:48.417 --> 09:51.458
-You did not have to do this.
I appreciate it.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.417
Very kind of you, very
kind of you. Thank you.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.667
-Anytime.
-Okay.

09:55.709 --> 09:57.875
-You play Eddie.
-We'll see, no promises.

09:57.917 --> 10:00.333
But thank you, that was really
nice. Nice to meet you.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.250
-Nice meeting you.
-Thank you very much.

10:02.291 --> 10:05.250
-Goodbye, bye bye.
-[Gerry]: Good bye. Wow.
[♪ Music]

10:08.166 --> 10:11.875
[♪ Music]
-[Gerry]: Okay.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.250
Ready?
Look at that.

10:14.291 --> 10:16.458
-I can't believe this.
-Me neither.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.625
-He just gave you these?
-Yeah.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.583
-Any chance he gave you
potatoes? Or salad?
-Better.

10:20.625 --> 10:22.250
-Alright.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.208
Oooh.
-Apparently this is a very
expensive bottle of wine.

10:27.250 --> 10:30.375
-Oh yeah, this is good stuff.
-Yeah.

10:30.417 --> 10:32.625
-Oh.
[Clicks mouth]

10:32.667 --> 10:34.583
-Mmm, I don't think we need
that for these.

10:34.625 --> 10:37.000
-I think you're right.
These aren't Barrels steaks.

10:37.041 --> 10:39.750
-These are glorious steaks. What
did he want in return for these?
-Nothing.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.959
-Nothing?
-Nothing.
-Everybody wants something.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.458
-I'm telling you I think he just
wanted to say thanks for doing
a great job with my kid.

10:45.500 --> 10:49.375
-I don't think you're this good.
-Just shut up and eat the steak.

10:49.417 --> 10:51.542
Oh.

10:51.583 --> 10:55.000
Gives it a little bit of
flavour. A little soda pop.

10:55.041 --> 10:57.500
Spritz it up. Spritz it up.
You want some?

10:57.542 --> 10:59.709
-No.
-Okay.

10:59.750 --> 11:01.792
Dig in.
-[Bill laughs]

11:02.625 --> 11:05.542
[♪ Music]

11:05.583 --> 11:08.417
-Alright? Get to class.
-Oh my.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.625
What did happen?

11:10.667 --> 11:14.417
-Yeah, I volunteer at a soup
kitchen and last night I guess I
stuck around a little too long.

11:14.458 --> 11:17.208
[Laughs]: But you should see
what they look like.

11:17.250 --> 11:19.917
-Really?
-Nah, just kidding.

11:19.959 --> 11:22.083
Obviously I waited 'til
they stopped.

11:22.125 --> 11:24.041
-Very wise.
-Yeah, but it was one kid.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.625
He twisted his ankle kicking me.

11:26.667 --> 11:29.583
Poor kid. I tried to help him,
take him to the hospital.

11:29.625 --> 11:31.792
But, ah, he smashed my face in.

11:31.834 --> 11:34.291
-This is very bad.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.917
-Anyway, that's his journey,
this is mine.

11:36.959 --> 11:39.792
Anthony! Get to class.

11:39.834 --> 11:42.625
-Oh, hey! Mr. Yurkov.
You were looking for me?

11:42.667 --> 11:44.542
-Mr. Duncan, so sorry to bother
you.

11:44.583 --> 11:48.000
Big game tonight!
-Yeah, big game. First game.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.375
-How do you like those steaks?
-Oh, they were great!

11:50.417 --> 11:53.500
My roommate and I, we had
a field day on those.
Thank you again.

11:53.542 --> 11:57.542
-My pleasure. Today I brought
you veal sandwich for good luck.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.750
-Thank you, you don't
need to keep doing this.

11:59.792 --> 12:02.750
-Best veal in the city. Three
days old. Ripped from mother.
Very tender.

12:02.792 --> 12:05.250
Hey! Play Eddie tonight.

12:05.291 --> 12:08.000
-I can't promise I'm going
to play Eddie.

12:08.041 --> 12:11.083
I don't think it's going to
happen. It's our first game.
He's just not ready.

12:11.125 --> 12:13.291
-Ohhhhh.
Oh, this is my brother.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.959
Eddie's favourite uncle, Vlad.
-Hello Vlad.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.166
-He's shy.
-Is he?

12:18.208 --> 12:20.667
-He don't speak English so good.
-Hello!

12:20.709 --> 12:23.000
-Anyway, enjoy sandwich.
-Yeah.

12:23.041 --> 12:26.458
-And who knows?
Maybe you play Eddie.

12:26.500 --> 12:31.208
-You know what? No.
I can't, too big a game.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.208
-You're funny.
-Alright, thank you.
See ya Vlad.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.458
-[Ivan]: Bye bye.
-[Gerry]: What a good guy.

12:36.500 --> 12:39.166
Hey.
-You're not taking gifts
from Mr. Yurkov are you?

12:39.208 --> 12:42.125
-No, it's a sandwich.
-Okay, are you stupid?

12:42.166 --> 12:44.583
Huh?
-Did he ask you to play Eddie?

12:44.625 --> 12:48.208
-Yeah, but so what?
Parents do that.
-Okay, it's a bribe, okay Gerry?

12:48.250 --> 12:50.208
-What are you saying Bobbi?
-I don't mean to freak you out.

12:50.250 --> 12:52.959
But the kids, they all
say he's mob.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.250
-Mob? It's a veal sandwich!
Not a hooker with blow strapped
across her chest.

12:57.291 --> 12:59.458
-What?
-Relax.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.500
-Okay, who drives around
with meat in their trunk?

13:01.542 --> 13:04.041
-Russians, I guess.
-Russians, Gerry?

13:04.083 --> 13:07.041
Or the mob? Just looking
out for you Gerry.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.208
-[Simon hums]

13:12.583 --> 13:15.125
-Hey Simon.
-Hey Frank. How's it going?

13:15.166 --> 13:18.083
-Great! Love my new job.
Love my students.

13:18.125 --> 13:20.250
Slept with an Asian chick
last night.

13:20.291 --> 13:22.583
-Really?
-Yeah. Gonna cross
that off my bucket list.

13:22.625 --> 13:25.208
-Cool.
-Yeah. Next? Tall.

13:25.250 --> 13:28.083
-[Simon]: Mmm.
-Hang on. Hey, Lisa.

13:28.125 --> 13:30.500
-Hey.
-How tall are you?

13:30.542 --> 13:32.166
-5'9".

13:33.333 --> 13:36.375
-She wants it.
-Boy, you got game.

13:36.417 --> 13:40.000
Feeling okay, bud?
-Ah, just problems with my wife.

13:40.041 --> 13:42.583
-[Simon]: Mmm.
-I guess I gotta get used to
saying ex-wife.

13:42.625 --> 13:45.208
-What a world. I'm sorry
to hear about that Paul.

13:45.250 --> 13:48.458
-She said I spend too much
time with charity work and not
enough time on her.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.625
[Laughs]: Fair point.
-Mmm, you have had one
heck of a week.

13:51.667 --> 13:55.291
-Like my dad always said, man:
"There's always somebody out
there worse off than you."

13:55.333 --> 13:58.500
-Hmm.
-See ya.

13:58.542 --> 14:00.667
I like him.

14:00.709 --> 14:04.709
I think it's the metal...on his
arms, he reminds me of a robot.

14:10.083 --> 14:13.333
-Ms. Mason, can I see
that bracelet?

14:13.375 --> 14:16.417
-[Laughs]: Yes.
Isn't it beautiful?

14:16.458 --> 14:18.709
-Yeah...It's mine.

14:18.750 --> 14:21.000
I lost it a few weeks ago.
-Excuse me?

14:21.041 --> 14:23.291
-I got it from my grandmother
for my birthday.

14:23.333 --> 14:26.750
-No, Ms. Walsh gave this
to me for my birthday.

14:26.792 --> 14:30.750
-Pretty sure you're mistaken.
-I'm certain you're mistaken,
Donna. Okay?

14:30.792 --> 14:32.667
-No, that's definitely my
bracelet.

14:32.709 --> 14:35.750
-Let this be the motivation for
you to do well in school.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.792
So you can land a good job
and afford nice things.

14:38.834 --> 14:42.417
Like this. Maybe not as nice,
but they'll be nice, okay?

14:42.458 --> 14:45.834
-Thanks for the valedictorian
speech, but it's my bracelet.

14:45.875 --> 14:48.709
-[Lisa exhales]: Okay.

14:48.750 --> 14:53.166
I'll tell you what, why don't we
meet after school and I'll
prove it to you.

14:53.208 --> 14:56.834
-Just don't lose it in the
meantime.
-I won't lose my bracelet.

14:56.875 --> 15:00.125
[Quietly]: In the meantime.

15:00.166 --> 15:03.667
[Whispers]: My bracelet.
[♪ Music]

15:03.709 --> 15:06.250
-[Gerry]: This is it.
This is the...

15:06.291 --> 15:08.625
First game of a new year.
New coach.

15:08.667 --> 15:13.291
I know you've don't well with
Coach Keenan, but my job is
to take you to another level.

15:13.333 --> 15:16.750
Alright? This is the beginning
of the Mr. D era.

15:16.792 --> 15:19.500
And it starts today, game one.
Let's not take this team
lightly.

15:19.542 --> 15:22.542
I know you beat them
badly last year but ah...

15:22.583 --> 15:25.000
Don't get complacent.
We know our starting five.

15:25.041 --> 15:28.458
Demar, Kyle, Terrance, mmm!

15:28.500 --> 15:31.625
Anthony, Jonas.
Today we want to make sure...

15:37.417 --> 15:39.917
-Make sure we what Coach?

15:39.959 --> 15:42.834
-What? Ah, you know what?
Look at that team.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.041
Look at them.
Starting five.

15:45.083 --> 15:48.417
Kyle, Terrance, Anthony,
Jonas and Eddie!

15:48.458 --> 15:50.792
Sorry, a little change.
Changed my mind.

15:50.834 --> 15:54.333
-Are you sure Coach?
-Yeah, are you sure?

15:54.375 --> 15:57.834
-Yeah, I'm sure.
-Coach, you said not to
take this team lightly.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.041
-I'm not taking them lightly,
Terrance.

16:00.083 --> 16:02.959
I want to make sure
we have height. 6'7".

16:03.000 --> 16:06.208
He's gonna get the ball for us.
Start the game. You ever
think of that?

16:06.250 --> 16:09.291
First possession. Trust me,
I know how to coach, okay?

16:09.333 --> 16:12.250
We get the ball first,
starts from there.

16:12.291 --> 16:15.291
Now bring it in on three,
together.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.750
One, two, three.
-[All]: Together.

16:17.792 --> 16:21.041
-Let's go.
-Seriously Coach?

16:21.083 --> 16:23.875
Eddie?
-Eddie. Go sit down.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.667
Hey, game one.
[Quietly]: Here we go buddy.

16:33.709 --> 16:36.166
Let's get that ball Eddie,
start the game off.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.667
Get the jump ball.
[Quietly]: Oh my god.

16:38.709 --> 16:42.500
You're supposed to jump.
[Quietly]: Can't even jump.

16:42.542 --> 16:46.583
[Gerry]: Come on Eddie.
Eddie, get up. Get up.

16:46.625 --> 16:49.583
-[Crowd cheers]
-Don't touch the ball Eddie.

16:49.625 --> 16:53.625
Just give it to Terrance.
Don't shoot Eddie!

16:53.667 --> 16:56.041
[Whispers]: How are you that
tall and that bad?

16:56.083 --> 16:59.041
One hand to dribble Eddie.

16:59.083 --> 17:01.291
One...
[Quietly]: Does he not know
the rules?

17:04.291 --> 17:06.542
You'll get in, when Eddie's
tired.

17:06.583 --> 17:08.333
[♪ Music]
-Or when Eddie's dad leaves.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.041
[♪ Music]

17:13.083 --> 17:15.125
Trudy?

17:15.166 --> 17:17.083
Go ahead, Donna.

17:17.125 --> 17:19.834
-Ms. Mason won't give me
back my bracelet.

17:19.875 --> 17:25.041
-Trudy, could you please explain
to Donna that you gave me this
bracelet for my birthday?

17:25.083 --> 17:27.041
-Let me see it.

17:30.458 --> 17:33.542
There you go.
-I knew it. Liar!

17:34.959 --> 17:37.166
-Trudy! What are you doing?

17:37.208 --> 17:39.792
-Here. Pick something else.

17:39.834 --> 17:42.166
-You stole that from the
Lost and Found box?

17:42.208 --> 17:46.333
-Shhh!
Look, here's a lovely scarf.

17:46.375 --> 17:49.000
-Trudy, these are the
students belongings.

17:49.041 --> 17:52.333
I mean, Donna's grandmother gave
her that...bracelet...

17:52.375 --> 17:54.625
[Clears her throat]

17:54.667 --> 17:56.834
-Is that?
-Yes it is.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.959
Unclaimed for over a month.

18:02.500 --> 18:06.208
-Thank you.
-This time don't wear it
around the school, ya idiot.

18:14.625 --> 18:17.834
-[Gerry]: Ahh, you're welcome.

18:17.875 --> 18:20.709
-Mr. Duncan, why you
do this to me?

18:20.750 --> 18:24.208
-Do what? We won. I started
Eddie, I didn't keep him in the
whole game, but...

18:24.250 --> 18:26.417
-You call yourself Coach?
Hmm?

18:26.458 --> 18:28.959
I give you steak. I give
you wine. I give you veal.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.166
And this is how you treat
my family?

18:31.208 --> 18:34.041
-Okay, okay. I'll start him
again next week and I'll play
him the whole game.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.291
-The whole game?
Are you hearing this?
-What?

18:36.333 --> 18:39.083
-This boy should never step on
basketball court again.

18:39.125 --> 18:42.125
He's terrible.
-But you said...

18:42.166 --> 18:45.917
-I didn't know he was this bad,
but you? You are coach,
you should know. He's garbage!

18:45.959 --> 18:48.166
-But Papa.
-Mohl-chyats!

18:48.208 --> 18:50.375
-[Gerry]: Shut up!

18:50.417 --> 18:53.750
-You humiliate me. You
humiliate my brother's.

18:53.792 --> 18:55.834
You humiliate my entire family.

18:55.875 --> 18:58.625
You leave me no option.

19:00.208 --> 19:02.875
-What's...?

19:02.917 --> 19:05.125
What's that supposed to mean?

19:05.166 --> 19:08.125
-No more steak, no more wine,
no more veal.

19:09.875 --> 19:13.875
-That's it? No more veal?
-Eat Hamburger.

19:13.917 --> 19:16.792
You are cut off.
Go! Go!

19:16.834 --> 19:19.083
You!

19:19.125 --> 19:22.583
-Where do I get the steaks?
-Up your ass!

19:22.625 --> 19:25.166
-My ese? Up my e...

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
-Lisa?

19:29.750 --> 19:31.709
Lisa, wait up.

19:34.250 --> 19:38.375
Hey.
-Hey Frank.

19:38.417 --> 19:41.291
-I, ah, wanted to apologize
about earlier.

19:41.333 --> 19:43.875
I get really nervous around
pretty ladies.

19:43.917 --> 19:47.542
-Aw, okay. Thanks Frank.

19:47.583 --> 19:51.166
-And um, maybe I could
take you for a belated
birthday drink sometime?

19:51.208 --> 19:54.208
-Yeah, maybe.
-Have a good night.

19:54.250 --> 19:56.041
-You too.

19:58.208 --> 20:00.667
-Crossing another one off
my list tonight. Triplets.

20:00.709 --> 20:03.083
-I don't think that those are...
-I'm a teacher, Lisa.

20:03.125 --> 20:06.250
I can't afford real triplets.

20:06.291 --> 20:09.125
Which one of you is Sarah?
I can't tell you apart.

20:09.166 --> 20:12.709
-Oh wow.

20:12.750 --> 20:15.500
-This sandwich is delicious.
Just what I needed.

20:15.542 --> 20:19.417
-My Nadia's in your band class.
-Nadia! Beautiful girl.

20:19.458 --> 20:22.166
-Oh my gosh, she loves
playing the trombone.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.625
-She's good.
-So, I have good idea.

20:24.667 --> 20:26.917
You make her first trombone.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.875
-Ah, we already have a first
trombone though.

20:28.917 --> 20:32.000
-Oh, I see.
Hey...

20:32.041 --> 20:34.667
You like merlot?

20:34.709 --> 20:38.375
-[Dwyer laughs]: Wow.
This week's finally looking up.

20:38.417 --> 20:42.166
-Play Nadia.
