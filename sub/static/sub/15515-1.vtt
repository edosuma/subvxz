00:55.188 --> 00:57.054
You are safe here
with me.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.339
Has a decision been reached
on how far this country

01:46.340 --> 01:47.506
would be willing to go

01:47.507 --> 01:51.535
in helping an anti-Castro
uprising or invasion in Cuba?

01:51.945 --> 01:54.580
Well, first, I want to
say that there will not be,

01:54.581 --> 01:56.049
under any conditions,

01:56.750 --> 01:59.720
an intervention in Cuba
by United States armed forces.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.255
And this government will do
everything it possibly can,

02:03.256 --> 02:06.092
and I think it can meet
its responsibilities,

02:06.093 --> 02:10.621
to make sure that there are no Americans
involved in any actions inside Cuba.

02:55.308 --> 02:57.937
Excuse me, sir. Do you
have change for a dollar?

03:05.685 --> 03:07.347
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.285
From our friends
on Wall Street. Miami?

03:44.991 --> 03:46.391
Right away.

03:59.339 --> 04:01.171
Cardinal is interested.

04:11.017 --> 04:15.455
So, the weatherman says Sunday is a
perfect day for a trip to the beach.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.082
I hope
you can still dance, Edward.

04:19.192 --> 04:22.828
Couple of days, we'll be doing the
cha-cha in El Comandante's bedroom.

04:22.829 --> 04:25.298
I'll try to remember to bring
my dancing shoes, Richard.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.266
Morning, Ray.
Mr. Hayes.

04:33.373 --> 04:36.400
Miami, and our op center
off Guatemala.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.547
Pack a bathing suit, Mr.
Brocco. We're going for a swim.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.778
What do you make
of our chances for success?

04:46.119 --> 04:48.952
If we get the support
that we've been promised,

04:49.389 --> 04:51.551
I'd say it's fairly certain.

04:52.225 --> 04:54.455
But if there are any doubts,
I can still put out the fire.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.389
It's gone beyond that.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.863
Rocking Chair
is still smiling.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.000
It's the White House.

05:04.304 --> 05:08.070
Everybody's waiting for
the good news. Godspeed.

05:10.510 --> 05:13.810
When you're back, come up to
the mountains. We'll go fishing.

05:18.885 --> 05:20.182
Yes, sir.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.878
He's been put on notice.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.623
In Cuba,
sometime before dawn,

05:28.094 --> 05:31.326
the invading forces'
B-26 bombers give air cover

05:31.865 --> 05:34.027
to men landing on the beach.

05:36.169 --> 05:40.333
As the sun rises, there is a surprise
attack from Castro's air force.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.067
The B-26es are shot down.

05:44.211 --> 05:48.170
Without air cover, the anti-Castro
force's ships are attacked.

05:48.515 --> 05:52.885
And the men are cut off from their
supplies. The situation looks dire.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.319
"Where is the air support?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.950
"Where the hell is the Navy?

05:59.326 --> 06:04.230
"Could you throw something into
this vital point in the battle?

06:06.867 --> 06:10.636
"Enemy in Red...
Trucks coming from Red Beach

06:10.637 --> 06:13.800
"are right now
one kilometer from Blue Beach.

06:15.842 --> 06:20.746
"Two thousand militia attacking
Blue Beach from east to west.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.848
"We need close air support
immediately.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.522
"Well, I am destroying all my
equipment and communications.

06:30.523 --> 06:33.392
"I have nothing with which to
fight. I am going to the woods.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.488
"I cannot wait for you.
I am going to the woods. "

07:14.567 --> 07:16.695
They knew
where to find us.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.841
There's a stranger
in our house, sir.

08:11.257 --> 08:12.748
I love you.

08:13.860 --> 08:17.262
People who really love
each other don't have secrets.

08:17.797 --> 08:19.857
You are safe here with me.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.705
I love you.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.706
People who really love
each other don't have secrets.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.543
You are safe here with me.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.521
You have such a...

08:53.633 --> 08:55.226
I love you.

08:56.002 --> 08:59.097
People who really love
each other don't have secrets.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.035
You are safe here with me.

09:13.253 --> 09:17.781
The President's saying he's going to
break the CIA into a thousand pieces.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.858
Somebody on your desk
gave away the store.

09:23.463 --> 09:26.465
Told the Soviets where to
find you at the Bay of Pigs.

09:26.466 --> 09:29.401
You got a big problem,
very close to home.

09:31.037 --> 09:34.871
There's gonna be an extensive
house-cleaning on your side of the street.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.076
Fucking cigarettes.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.707
My ring doesn't even
fit me anymore.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.323
They didn't get it all.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.158
I'm sorry.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.083
Be careful.

09:56.496 --> 10:00.899
Your name is on a "must worry"
list, right at the very top.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.438
You forgot your hat.

10:38.605 --> 10:41.874
Somebody left a package
on my doorstep last night.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.207
Have Tech wash them
right away.

10:51.751 --> 10:54.052
I've been trying to reach you.

10:54.053 --> 10:55.821
I haven't been staying
at the Embassy compound.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.449
I've been doing
some outside work.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.056
I heard there was a setback.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.589
Sometimes the best-laid plans
of mice and men...

11:05.398 --> 11:06.999
Be very careful.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.230
I'll be fine.
You worry too much.

11:10.069 --> 11:11.560
Just please be careful.

11:11.804 --> 11:13.466
Everything's fine.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.465
Goodbye, Son.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.467
Goodbye, Father.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.919
We sail the ocean blue

12:54.841 --> 12:59.711
I'm called little Buttercup
Dear little Buttercup

12:59.712 --> 13:03.205
Though I could never tell why

13:03.883 --> 13:08.548
But still I'm called Buttercup
Poor little Buttercup

13:08.888 --> 13:12.381
Sweet little Buttercup, I

13:13.059 --> 13:17.394
I've treacle and toffee
I've tea and I've coffee

13:17.997 --> 13:20.832
But hark ye, my merry friend,
hast ever thought

13:20.833 --> 13:24.770
that beneath this gay
and frivolous

13:26.239 --> 13:27.729
exterior

13:29.742 --> 13:31.972
there may lurk a

13:32.178 --> 13:33.578
Cankerworm?

13:46.059 --> 13:49.688
Miss Buttercup. Skull and
Bones. Accept or reject?

13:51.664 --> 13:52.995
Accept.

13:54.967 --> 13:56.526
Not a word to anyone.

13:58.938 --> 14:02.204
How does it feel being a
woman? Why do you want to know?

14:03.976 --> 14:05.308
Gentlemen,

14:05.878 --> 14:09.644
I will remind you, you have
all taken an oath of secrecy.

14:11.117 --> 14:15.020
You have been chosen to become members
of America's most secret society.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.618
For over 100 years,

14:20.159 --> 14:23.061
Skull and Bones members
have included a President,

14:23.563 --> 14:26.965
Vice Presidents,
Supreme Court justices,

14:27.400 --> 14:31.803
congressmen and senators,
captains of science and industry.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.370
The very best of America.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.802
I don't think this is for me.
You can't take it personally.

15:03.803 --> 15:07.797
Getting pissed on is personal, Mr.
Russell. I take it very personally.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.033
Edward, we're all
in this together.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.173
Come back inside.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.311
We're brothers for life.

15:23.523 --> 15:28.119
Tell us, Mr. Wilson, brother to brother,
something you've never told anyone before.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.487
Your most guarded secret.

15:32.064 --> 15:35.057
Something you will need
to trust us with.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.765
It was
the Fourth of July, 1025.

15:43.409 --> 15:44.900
I was six.

15:48.247 --> 15:51.012
I was playing tag
with a friend of mine.

15:51.217 --> 15:52.878
Edward, careful.

15:53.085 --> 15:57.045
And I tried to get away from him, so I
ran up the stairs into my parents' room

15:58.424 --> 16:00.119
and I hid in the closet.

16:03.296 --> 16:07.528
I looked at my father's clothes, and
hanging there was his Admiral's jacket.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.161
And then I heard a sound.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.002
And I saw my father.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.243
And I must have made a noise,
because he turned,

16:18.244 --> 16:20.474
and came into the closet
and opened the door.

16:22.381 --> 16:25.044
Have you ever
made up a story, Edward?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.719
Told your friends something
you knew wasn't true,

16:27.720 --> 16:31.918
and you know that if they found
out, they wouldn't like you anymore?

16:32.825 --> 16:35.624
Why? Because
you lied to them.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.787
Do you understand?

16:39.599 --> 16:42.159
And he asked me
if I knew what trust was.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.604
And I said, "Trust is when
you feel safe with someone. "

16:45.605 --> 16:48.874
Like with my friends.
Like with you and Mother.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.537
And then he said,
"Don't ever lie.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.312
"If you lie to your friends,
they won't trust you.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.279
"And you will have nothing

17:03.289 --> 17:05.348
"and you'll never be safe. "

17:08.127 --> 17:12.496
He told me to go downstairs and watch
the fireworks, because they'd started.

17:17.136 --> 17:18.797
And then he shut the door.

17:24.977 --> 17:29.147
The sound of the gunshot was very
different from the sound of the fireworks.

17:29.148 --> 17:32.709
And even at six years old, I knew
there was a big, big difference.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.878
There was a lot of blood.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.785
Father?

17:40.393 --> 17:43.658
And in his left hand, he
held a note that was sealed.

17:46.165 --> 17:49.396
I don't know why, but I took the
note and I put it in my pocket.

17:51.637 --> 17:54.072
I always said
it was an accident.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.633
It wasn't an accident.
My father killed himself.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.722
Congratulations, Mr. Wilson.
I'm Richard Hayes,

18:17.964 --> 18:20.125
Master of Secrets and Orders.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.537
What did the note say?

18:25.538 --> 18:27.700
I told you,
I never read the note.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.635
You didn't read the note?

18:31.310 --> 18:32.471
No.

18:37.883 --> 18:42.344
My father said your father was going
to be appointed Secretary of the Navy

18:43.723 --> 18:47.591
until his loyalty
was brought under question.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.890
We're not gonna have a problem
with your loyalty, are we?

19:00.473 --> 19:04.569
"And yet, a certain
word, a glance, a guise

19:05.144 --> 19:08.978
"Will mirror never show,
reflecting not my gaze

19:09.448 --> 19:11.781
"But my uncertain question
caught

19:12.151 --> 19:14.882
"Inside a shadow
of our shifting eyes?"

19:18.557 --> 19:20.890
That really is quite elegant,
Mr. Wilson.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.053
Good order. Very precise.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.765
Feeling of the unknown.

19:27.633 --> 19:30.864
Fine poetry is the music
of mathematics.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.738
Numbers singing.

19:34.874 --> 19:38.742
You have to look behind the
words to understand their meaning.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.072
Right. Well, good night,
gentlemen.

19:45.451 --> 19:46.919
Mr. Wilson?

19:47.053 --> 19:50.181
May I see you in my office
for a few words?

19:52.058 --> 19:55.926
I'm recommending you as editor of
our poetry magazine, The Poeticus.

19:57.396 --> 20:01.060
I'm honored. Thank you.
I appreciate your faith in me.

20:01.567 --> 20:04.503
Never be ashamed
of your abilities, Edward.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.520
Wasn't there a picture that
used to sit on the mantel, there?

20:22.521 --> 20:24.751
It was a group of soldiers?

20:24.990 --> 20:27.859
It's my father's
Crimean War regiment.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.294
The glass broke.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.262
I'm having it mended.

20:34.266 --> 20:38.328
I remembered it because it reminded
me of my father. He was in the war.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.636
I think we're being watched.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.936
Being watched?
What do you mean?

20:47.613 --> 20:49.274
There's a man in a hat.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.653
I don't see anybody.

20:59.792 --> 21:03.854
You know, there's so much I'd
like to share with you, Edward.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.799
But I hardly know anything
about you at all,

21:07.800 --> 21:10.792
apart from you being
a particularly bright student.

21:14.974 --> 21:19.001
I feel that we have
a kind of kindred spirit.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.715
I really should be going.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.984
Oh, I've started
to write something.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.714
Perhaps you'd like
to hear it.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.656
"A bud has burst
on the upper bough

21:38.330 --> 21:41.163
"The linnet sang
in my heart today

21:41.500 --> 21:44.163
"I know where the pale green
grasses show

21:45.337 --> 21:48.330
"By a tiny runnel,
off the way

21:48.674 --> 21:50.335
"And the earth is wet

21:50.609 --> 21:55.342
"A cuckoo said in my brain,
'Not yet, not yet"'

21:56.949 --> 21:58.110
I haven't finished it.

22:23.475 --> 22:24.807
Excuse me.

22:27.313 --> 22:28.746
Excuse me.

22:35.554 --> 22:36.885
Please.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.718
I'm sorry. I can't hear.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.094
What's your name?

22:55.908 --> 22:57.239
Edward.

22:58.878 --> 23:02.447
I'm sorry. Would you say it
again? I have to read your lips.

23:02.448 --> 23:03.779
Edward.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.649
Hello, Edward.

23:07.853 --> 23:09.184
I'm Laura.

23:09.555 --> 23:12.286
I'm sorry,
would you say that again?

23:41.620 --> 23:44.756
There isn't one person in a hundred
who would walk by a hat on a bench

23:44.757 --> 23:46.623
without giving it
a second look.

23:48.027 --> 23:51.656
That says a lot about you, Mr.
Wilson. You don't distract easily.

23:53.632 --> 23:55.566
She's a very pretty girl.

23:55.901 --> 23:58.837
Sam Murach. I'm with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

24:05.644 --> 24:07.908
Mind if I walk along with you?

24:09.548 --> 24:12.417
I had a chance to have a talk
with a fraternity brother of yours.

24:12.418 --> 24:14.886
John Russell,
the senator's son.

24:14.887 --> 24:18.550
John said you might help us.
You're friendly with Dr. Fredericks?

24:19.024 --> 24:21.516
He's my thesis advisor,
if that's what you mean.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.961
He's been recruiting faculty
members and students

24:23.962 --> 24:27.665
to join an organization called the
American German Cultural Committee.

24:27.666 --> 24:30.897
It's a Nazi front. Has he
talked to you about that?

24:32.671 --> 24:35.106
I'm a poetry student,
Mr. Murach.

24:36.675 --> 24:38.176
I'm not political.

24:38.177 --> 24:41.346
We'd be very interested in finding out
the names of some of the other organizers

24:41.347 --> 24:43.110
for the Cultural Committee.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.850
Are you asking me to spy
on Dr. Fredericks?

24:46.285 --> 24:48.048
I'm asking you
to be a good citizen.

24:55.461 --> 24:58.123
You blow that thing up,
it'll be fine.

25:05.304 --> 25:06.794
I'll be seeing you.

25:08.574 --> 25:11.442
In Poland, Hitler watches
German regiments

25:11.443 --> 25:13.241
stream across the river San.

25:13.379 --> 25:16.381
This was part of the river line
which the invading army forced

25:16.382 --> 25:19.783
in its flanking drive
through southern Poland.

25:20.252 --> 25:23.154
The Nazi F·hrer makes a quick
tour in the conquered nation

25:23.155 --> 25:25.783
among the soldiers
in captured towns.

25:26.925 --> 25:31.462
Hitler has given the word of war, and
war it is! Poland has been guaranteed...

25:31.463 --> 25:35.733
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great privilege
to have with us here tonight Mr. Haupt,

25:35.734 --> 25:37.429
the F% hrer's
Education Minister.

25:37.903 --> 25:38.893
Mr. Haupt?

25:39.772 --> 25:40.905
Good evening.

25:40.906 --> 25:44.776
Thank you, Dr. Fredericks and members of
the American German Cultural Committee,

25:44.777 --> 25:47.109
for giving me the opportunity
to come to Yale.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.013
Germany has always been
a country of...

25:49.014 --> 25:51.048
Yes. Interesting.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.618
It has been
a great pleasure...

26:05.197 --> 26:07.632
...making
new acquaintances...

26:09.468 --> 26:10.799
Excuse me.
Of course.

26:33.158 --> 26:34.854
Someone's in here!

27:05.090 --> 27:08.059
Are you enjoying yourself,
Edward? Very much so.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.790
I'd like you
to meet Mr. Haupt.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.600
You know Dr. Manheim?
Yes, we've met.

27:16.301 --> 27:21.364
I've been asked by the faculty chairman
to relinquish my post here at Yale.

27:23.342 --> 27:26.573
Now, you'll hear many reasons
for what caused my departure.

27:27.479 --> 27:30.779
Suffice it to say I'm leaving
with my name intact.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.384
Good luck in your endeavors.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.388
Now, Edward,

27:46.198 --> 27:48.462
what did I do
to deserve this?

27:49.168 --> 27:53.070
Have you such little regard for me that
you'd betray me for my political beliefs?

27:53.772 --> 27:58.767
You know and I know Trumbull
Stickney wrote that poem in 1002.

28:00.612 --> 28:03.809
You were my teacher.
You betrayed me.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.463
I thought
we were going to a party.

28:32.477 --> 28:35.446
You want to protect me
from them, don't you?

28:35.447 --> 28:36.981
No.

28:36.982 --> 28:39.317
You think they'll make
fun of me. That's not it.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.787
That's not true.
It's okay.

28:50.162 --> 28:52.187
I'm happy to be with you.

29:01.106 --> 29:02.904
Would you like to dance?

29:03.609 --> 29:05.476
I'm not a very good dancer.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.571
That's all right.
I'm not a good dancer either.

29:18.523 --> 29:20.424
How does this song go?

29:26.298 --> 29:29.131
Blue skies

29:31.036 --> 29:33.368
Smiling on me

29:37.042 --> 29:40.376
Nothing but blue skies

29:43.482 --> 29:45.814
Do I see

29:53.292 --> 29:55.893
Excuse me, everybody,
I have an announcement.

29:55.894 --> 29:59.626
I've just been told England and
France declared war on Germany.

29:59.798 --> 30:03.098
But please continue dancing
and enjoying our music.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.770
And I'll update you
as information comes in.

30:05.771 --> 30:07.102
Thank you.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.989
Before long,
we'll be at war, too.

30:32.864 --> 30:35.424
Would you like to get
a room for us?

31:06.198 --> 31:07.392
Umm...

31:10.602 --> 31:12.161
Turn down the light.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.744
I can't. I can't.

31:46.171 --> 31:48.333
Good night.
Good night.

31:59.818 --> 32:01.513
Thank you, Edward.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.386
For what?
For being so nice.

32:35.153 --> 32:36.353
In view of the fact

32:36.354 --> 32:38.448
we're taking a propaganda
lambasting around the world,

32:39.891 --> 32:43.694
why is it not useful, sir,
for us to explore with you

32:43.695 --> 32:46.960
the real facts behind this,
or our motivations?

32:47.933 --> 32:52.199
There's an old saying that victory has a
hundred fathers and defeat is an orphan.

32:52.737 --> 32:54.672
And I wouldn't be surprised

32:54.673 --> 32:57.802
if information poured
in here regarding...

32:59.077 --> 33:00.306
Hello, Edward.

33:04.382 --> 33:06.112
What are you doing here?

33:06.585 --> 33:09.353
There were only a handful
of us until moment zero

33:09.354 --> 33:11.846
who knew where we were
going to land in Cuba.

33:13.291 --> 33:15.453
One of us
couldn't keep a secret.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.093
I know it wasn't me.

33:19.631 --> 33:22.800
Mr. Allen asked for
the Zapata list of personnel

33:22.801 --> 33:24.633
who participated
in the operation.

33:26.471 --> 33:27.705
I don't have one.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.640
Tell Mr. Allen I'll give him
the list personally.

33:29.641 --> 33:31.575
We're in the same boat
together.

33:33.311 --> 33:34.645
A leaky boat.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.680
Don't ever think we're in
the same boat, Mr. Hayes.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.947
We're either going to sink
or swim together.

33:42.687 --> 33:46.749
People like us,
we don't let each other drown.

33:55.233 --> 33:59.932
I have said as much as I feel
can be usefully said by me

34:00.438 --> 34:03.607
in regard to the events
of the past few days.

34:03.608 --> 34:07.443
Further statements,
detailed discussions,

34:08.213 --> 34:11.148
are not
to conceal responsibility,

34:11.149 --> 34:13.139
because I'm the responsible
officer of the government...

34:21.693 --> 34:23.388
Mother, Father.

34:24.295 --> 34:25.763
This is Edward Wilson.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.164
Mrs. Russell.
Hello.

34:27.165 --> 34:29.725
Senator. Yes. It's a
pleasure to finally meet you.

34:30.168 --> 34:32.068
Phillip and Toddy Allen.

34:32.871 --> 34:36.239
Mr. Allen was President
of Bones, Class of '12.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.572
Welcome to our little
clubhouse. Thank you.

34:38.743 --> 34:39.972
Where's Clover?

34:40.312 --> 34:42.012
Oh, there she is.

34:42.013 --> 34:43.708
I think so. Yes.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.810
This is my sister, Clover.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.120
Hello, I'm Edward.
Nice to meet you.

34:50.121 --> 34:51.783
Nice to meet you.

34:54.391 --> 34:55.449
Bonesmen!

34:57.094 --> 34:58.927
All here!
All here!

34:59.965 --> 35:02.466
Reverend Collins
will offer grace.

35:02.467 --> 35:04.702
Bonesmen first,
God second.

35:04.703 --> 35:08.196
Dear God, we thank you for
guiding the Evans Family Trust

35:08.340 --> 35:10.774
in the care
of our beloved island,

35:11.376 --> 35:14.945
so that we may come here with
our families and our friends

35:14.946 --> 35:17.244
in comfort and in privacy.

35:25.056 --> 35:27.423
He said he was gonna
ask me to dance later.

35:28.960 --> 35:29.950
Here we go.

35:46.911 --> 35:50.006
Don't you dance, Mr. Wilson?
Nobody asked me.

35:53.885 --> 35:54.875
Well,

35:56.187 --> 35:58.417
I think I'll take my chances.

36:00.525 --> 36:01.925
I'm asking.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.282
John is very fond of you.
And I'm very fond of him.

36:25.550 --> 36:28.212
He's talking of going off
to fight with the English.

36:28.553 --> 36:31.288
My father isn't particularly
pleased about it

36:31.289 --> 36:34.225
because he's one of the
organizers of America First.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.995
Wouldn't look very good for an
isolationist's son to go off to war, would it?

36:37.996 --> 36:41.694
Your brother John is a man of
great conviction. I admire him.

36:42.233 --> 36:45.260
And what about you, Mr.
Wilson? What do you believe in?

36:47.972 --> 36:49.634
Are you in school?

36:56.681 --> 36:59.048
You don't say very much,
do you?

37:00.285 --> 37:02.276
When there's something
worth saying.

37:03.455 --> 37:04.922
Oh! Well.

37:05.857 --> 37:08.019
I think I'm going to like you.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.331
Mr. Hayes.

37:16.801 --> 37:18.132
Gentlemen.

37:24.709 --> 37:27.610
General William Sullivan,
Mr. Edward Wilson.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.546
It's a great honor, sir.

37:29.547 --> 37:32.483
I'd get up and shake your hand,
but my fucking feet are killing me.

37:32.484 --> 37:36.053
Something about too much sugar
in my blood and my urine.

37:36.054 --> 37:37.851
So when do you boys start
your pissing contest?

37:40.492 --> 37:42.983
I'll excuse myself.

37:45.497 --> 37:46.828
Thank you, Phillip.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.430
Why don't you sit down?

38:04.282 --> 38:07.115
You understand that whatever we
discuss here doesn't leave this room.

38:08.686 --> 38:10.018
Of course.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.113
We'll eventually
get involved in this war.

38:13.358 --> 38:16.452
Not because we want to, but
because we have to, and we should.

38:17.128 --> 38:20.531
And the President has asked me to look into
creating a Foreign Intelligence Service.

38:20.532 --> 38:24.468
And if that happens, I'll be looking for
patriotic, honorable, bright young men

38:24.469 --> 38:27.804
from the right backgrounds to
manage the various departments.

38:27.805 --> 38:29.940
In other words,
no Jews or Negroes,

38:29.941 --> 38:32.876
and very few Catholics, and
that's only because I'm a Catholic.

38:35.847 --> 38:38.714
You'd be trained and commissioned
in the Army and posted overseas.

38:38.883 --> 38:40.350
If it's something
you're interested in,

38:40.351 --> 38:42.752
you have to be ready to leave
at a moment's notice.

38:44.756 --> 38:47.624
I don't want your answer now.
Just think about it.

38:47.625 --> 38:51.228
But this isn't a bunch of fraternity boys
sitting around playing with their pricks.

38:51.229 --> 38:53.493
This is for real.
For America.

39:04.442 --> 39:06.570
Have fun.
And behave yourselves.

39:12.283 --> 39:15.116
I'm supposed to be looking
for the perfect husband.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.182
Are you the perfect husband,
Mr. Wilson?

39:19.390 --> 39:21.222
Perfect in every way.

39:26.464 --> 39:30.731
Then is there some reason that
you won't put your arm around me?

39:33.371 --> 39:36.306
Day and night

39:37.942 --> 39:41.538
Night and day

39:42.647 --> 39:44.809
You are the one

39:46.317 --> 39:47.580
I like this.

39:48.152 --> 39:49.484
Very smart.

39:53.157 --> 39:55.592
And under the sun

39:58.963 --> 40:00.829
...near to me

40:02.934 --> 40:05.926
Do you have a problem
with women, Mr. Bones?

40:40.805 --> 40:42.272
Do you love me?

40:42.273 --> 40:44.435
What?
Tell me you love me.

40:44.809 --> 40:46.140
I love you.

40:46.477 --> 40:47.811
Do you love me?

40:47.812 --> 40:49.803
I do. I love you. I...
I still don't believe you.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.482
I love you.
Say it. Say it.

40:52.717 --> 40:53.984
I love you.
I think I love you...

40:53.985 --> 40:55.485
Look at me.
Look at me! Stop. Stop.

40:55.486 --> 40:57.819
Tell me! I love you! I think I love you.

41:13.004 --> 41:16.872
As soon as the world comes to
its senses, I'm going to travel.

41:18.509 --> 41:21.672
London. Paris. Rome.

41:24.682 --> 41:26.343
You can come with me.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.016
Is everything all right?

41:40.198 --> 41:41.529
Fine.

41:45.069 --> 41:46.901
We're worlds apart.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.471
What do you mean?

41:50.842 --> 41:53.606
I feel like
I'm just a curiosity to you.

41:54.812 --> 41:57.047
That is not...
That's not true.

41:57.048 --> 42:00.984
I feel like I'm not real
to you. That is not true.

42:00.985 --> 42:03.818
Edward. That is not
how I feel about you.

42:12.330 --> 42:13.524
Edward?

42:32.150 --> 42:33.481
John.

42:33.985 --> 42:36.420
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.187
My sister.
She's pregnant.

42:55.339 --> 42:57.831
I know you'll do
what's expected of you.

43:06.851 --> 43:11.755
Do you, Edward Bell Wilson,
take Margaret Ann Russell

43:12.023 --> 43:14.583
to be your
lawfully wedded wife?

43:15.426 --> 43:17.759
To love, honor and cherish

43:18.563 --> 43:21.054
in sickness and in health

43:21.332 --> 43:25.769
in good times and in bad
times, until death do you part?

43:26.437 --> 43:27.737
I do.

43:27.738 --> 43:29.969
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

43:45.656 --> 43:48.023
A man in uniform
wants to see you.

43:48.593 --> 43:50.288
Excuse me, Mother.

43:51.329 --> 43:54.765
Did your mother and I ever tell
you where we took our honeymoon?

43:57.168 --> 43:58.567
Mr. Edward Wilson?

43:59.337 --> 44:01.100
If we could
speak alone, sir.

44:01.906 --> 44:04.641
Would you like to sit down?
No, thank you, sir.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.610
General Sullivan
sends his regards.

44:06.611 --> 44:09.978
He wanted to ask you, sir, if you're still
interested in seeing the rest of the world.

44:10.681 --> 44:12.741
Yes, I certainly would be.

44:15.620 --> 44:17.986
Good afternoon, sir.
Thank you.

44:36.207 --> 44:39.302
My orders came through.
I'll be going overseas.

44:41.212 --> 44:42.372
When?

44:43.881 --> 44:45.372
In one week.

44:46.551 --> 44:49.748
What are you going to do,
Edward? Save the world?

45:05.503 --> 45:07.665
You are safe
here with me.

45:13.177 --> 45:15.168
The photograph
is particularly dark.

45:15.379 --> 45:19.373
As we can see, there is a
Caucasian man and a Negro woman.

45:19.917 --> 45:21.715
The resolution breaks down
pretty quickly.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.382
The film stock is definitely
Russian, low grade.

45:28.426 --> 45:31.761
One of the areas we've been
focusing on is the mosquito netting.

45:31.762 --> 45:35.565
Mosquito netting is predominantly
in Africa, Southeast Asia,

45:35.566 --> 45:36.967
any tropical climate.

45:36.968 --> 45:42.372
The window curtains here have a
distinctive pattern on them of baobab trees,

45:42.373 --> 45:44.034
also seen in Africa.

45:44.875 --> 45:48.209
Next to the curtains, we can
see the building's balustrade.

45:48.813 --> 45:51.881
There's a pigeon here.
It's kind of hard to make out.

45:51.882 --> 45:54.918
Pigeons are mostly found
in urban areas, town squares.

45:54.919 --> 45:57.581
If you listen closely,
you'll hear an airplane.

45:59.490 --> 46:00.821
We've washed it out.

46:04.028 --> 46:06.162
By the sound of the thrust
of the jet engines,

46:06.163 --> 46:08.398
we can determine that
it's a plane taking off,

46:08.399 --> 46:09.966
and more than 1,000 feet
off the ground,

46:09.967 --> 46:12.436
which would further suggest
a large urban area.

46:12.737 --> 46:15.238
On this section of the tape, when
you clear out background noise,

46:15.239 --> 46:16.673
you can hear a female voice.

46:16.674 --> 46:18.073
I love you.

46:19.076 --> 46:22.478
People who really love
each other don't have secrets.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.014
You are safe here with me.

46:24.015 --> 46:25.515
Assuming we're talking about
the same woman,

46:25.516 --> 46:27.678
the linguists tell us
her accent is French.

46:29.687 --> 46:32.122
There's one word here,
we can't make it out yet.

46:33.024 --> 46:35.959
There's an unidentifiable
noise washing her out.

46:38.362 --> 46:40.830
It plays throughout the
recording at a high frequency,

46:40.831 --> 46:43.494
suggesting an air-raid siren
of some sort.

46:44.068 --> 46:45.831
We're gonna keep
playing with it.

46:48.673 --> 46:52.242
This is a time for everyone
to stand together and hold firm

46:53.577 --> 46:54.909
As they are doing.

46:56.013 --> 46:58.209
I express my admiration

46:58.749 --> 47:00.617
for the exemplary manner

47:00.618 --> 47:04.087
in which all the air-raid
precaution services of London

47:04.088 --> 47:05.722
are being discharged.

47:05.723 --> 47:07.123
May I help you?
Yes.

47:07.124 --> 47:09.826
I'm here to see the tailor
about a fitting for a new suit.

47:09.827 --> 47:12.696
Certainly. And what kind of suit would
you be interested in this evening?

47:12.697 --> 47:15.198
A tweed or worsted?
Perhaps a nice gabardine?

47:15.199 --> 47:17.467
Perhaps a worsted
and a tweed.

47:17.468 --> 47:19.536
Both single-breasted?
Yes.

47:19.537 --> 47:22.404
Two or three buttons, sir?
Three buttons.

47:25.209 --> 47:27.109
If you might come this way,
please, sir.

47:35.986 --> 47:38.555
Please. Our senior tailor
will be right with you, sir.

47:38.556 --> 47:40.149
Thank you.

47:49.366 --> 47:51.062
Welcome to London.

47:53.270 --> 47:57.107
You're going to have to learn as
quickly and thoroughly as possible

47:57.108 --> 48:00.677
the English system of
intelligence. The black arts.

48:00.678 --> 48:02.544
Particularly
counterintelligence.

48:03.614 --> 48:06.515
The uses of information,
disinformation,

48:07.084 --> 48:10.782
and how their use is,
ultimately, power.

48:16.127 --> 48:18.789
They've agreed to open
their operations to us.

48:20.364 --> 48:24.300
They can't win the war without us,
but they don't really want us here.

48:24.301 --> 48:27.971
Intelligence is their mother's milk and
they don't like sharing the royal tit

48:27.972 --> 48:30.473
with people
who don't have titles.

48:30.474 --> 48:32.807
Your London tutor is waiting
to meet you.

48:33.277 --> 48:34.768
This way, sir.

48:38.816 --> 48:41.410
...six-five megacycles
at one, three, five, nine.

48:42.953 --> 48:47.049
Eight point seven-six-five
megacycles at one, three, five, nine.

48:52.763 --> 48:55.999
Four, two,
zero, seven. Standing by.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.561
point seven-six-five megacycles
at one, three, five, nine.

49:00.871 --> 49:04.240
I should have known better
than to use Stickney.

49:04.241 --> 49:08.235
Job well done, Mr. Wilson. You
blew a two-year operation for me.

49:09.346 --> 49:13.681
I told General Sullivan to keep an
eye on you. Just as well, really.

49:14.018 --> 49:17.750
I was beginning to long for
the bone-chilling cold of home.

49:22.026 --> 49:23.858
It isn't personal.

49:29.133 --> 49:32.302
Mr. Carlson? Is this
the American Trade Bureau?

49:32.303 --> 49:33.827
Which product?

49:36.373 --> 49:37.807
Dry goods.

49:37.808 --> 49:40.710
You're late. Yeah. That's
what my mother said.

49:43.047 --> 49:47.484
Raymond Duca Brocco, born
May 6, 1007, New York City.

49:47.818 --> 49:50.420
St. Ignatius High School,
Fordham University.

49:50.421 --> 49:52.422
Married Anita Delvecchio,
two children...

49:52.423 --> 49:53.754
Stephanie and David.

49:58.796 --> 50:01.798
Six-foot-two, 1·2 pounds,
black hair, brown eyes.

50:01.799 --> 50:04.461
Military record,
five years Intelligence.

50:05.135 --> 50:08.902
Anything you'd like to add? Do
you want to look up my ass, too?

50:09.773 --> 50:11.407
You're working for me,
Sergeant Brocco.

50:11.408 --> 50:12.909
I'm working for the
United States government, sir.

50:12.910 --> 50:14.777
In this office, I am
the United States government.

50:14.778 --> 50:17.714
You're pretty sure of yourself
for somebody who just began.

50:17.715 --> 50:18.848
They wouldn't
tell me your name.

50:18.849 --> 50:20.717
Then how do you know
you're not in the wrong place?

50:20.718 --> 50:24.120
They said you were a serious SOB
that didn't have any sense of humor.

50:24.121 --> 50:25.919
There can't be two of you.

50:35.499 --> 50:36.830
Are you going to answer it?

50:37.001 --> 50:38.668
Depends if I'm working for you
or if I'm not.

50:38.669 --> 50:41.331
One of your jobs, Sergeant,
is answering the telephone.

50:42.172 --> 50:43.697
Yes, sir.

50:48.345 --> 50:52.582
Use your tradecraft well, particularly
the use of black propaganda

50:52.583 --> 50:54.851
and the ingredient
known as playback.

50:54.852 --> 50:57.253
Understanding how effectively
your own disinformation

50:57.254 --> 50:58.847
is actually working
on the enemy.

51:01.292 --> 51:02.625
It's almost four.

51:02.626 --> 51:04.527
How do you spell syphilis?
Is it one "L" or two?

51:04.528 --> 51:08.829
Syphilis. One, I think.
I never had it.

51:09.667 --> 51:13.169
It's vital to penetrate the
enemy's intelligence services.

51:13.170 --> 51:15.872
Push them into
an unreal world, as it were.

51:15.873 --> 51:17.073
Doctors in England today

51:17.074 --> 51:20.576
announced that medical records taken
from Adolf Hitler's personal physician,

51:20.577 --> 51:24.280
Dr. Theodor Morell, revealed that
Mr. Hitler had contracted syphilis

51:24.281 --> 51:27.308
while serving in the German
armed forces during World War I.

51:27.618 --> 51:30.920
The very qualities that make
a good intelligence officer,

51:30.921 --> 51:35.188
a suspicious mind, a love
of complexity and detail,

51:35.659 --> 51:38.856
are the very qualities of
someone you'll be observing.

51:50.507 --> 51:52.008
Good evening, Lord Cooper.

51:52.009 --> 51:54.501
I have some information that
might be of interest to you.

51:54.745 --> 51:58.348
The mental facility to detect
conspiracies and betrayal

51:58.349 --> 52:02.352
are the same qualities most
likely to corrode natural judgment.

52:02.353 --> 52:07.689
Everything that seems clear is bent.
And everything that seems bent is clear.

52:08.158 --> 52:09.692
Trapped in reflections,

52:09.693 --> 52:13.796
you must learn to recognize when
a lie masquerades as the truth,

52:13.797 --> 52:16.494
and then deal with it
efficiently, dispassionately.

52:16.900 --> 52:19.769
We know you've been passing
information to the German High Command.

52:19.770 --> 52:21.804
Never give anyone
time to think.

52:21.805 --> 52:24.207
Now, I'm going to offer you
one of two choices.

52:24.208 --> 52:27.543
You set the tone of the discussion
and quickly come to the point.

52:27.544 --> 52:29.879
Either you can be executed
for treason,

52:29.880 --> 52:31.781
or you can continue to spy
for the enemy here

52:31.782 --> 52:34.517
and provide them with the
information we provide you with.

52:34.518 --> 52:37.420
Pass this on to your German friends.
And if I find out it wasn't done,

52:37.421 --> 52:38.688
there won't be
a second chance.

52:38.689 --> 52:41.958
You'll quite simply be hanged as
a spy. Do we understand each other?

52:41.959 --> 52:44.360
How do we know he won't
be working for two masters?

52:44.361 --> 52:46.523
Precisely. We don't.

52:47.564 --> 52:50.864
How do I know if I can
even trust you? You won't.

52:51.802 --> 52:54.703
I mean, I hope you're lucky
enough to meet someone you trust.

52:55.739 --> 52:57.400
I regret to say

52:58.175 --> 52:59.506
I haven't.

53:04.248 --> 53:05.915
You must be young Edward.

53:05.916 --> 53:08.351
Dr. Fredericks has told me
so much about you.

53:08.352 --> 53:09.919
Arch Cummings.
Nice to meet you.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.921
Nice to meet you.

53:11.922 --> 53:14.524
I understand we're of
a like mind on many things.

53:14.525 --> 53:17.085
Good schoolboys,
Yale, Cambridge.

53:17.861 --> 53:19.193
Dreamers.

53:20.164 --> 53:23.566
They say to be an exceptional
intelligence officer,

53:23.801 --> 53:25.268
you have to have
a steady mind,

53:25.269 --> 53:29.228
an unwavering sense of belief
in what you're doing,

53:29.873 --> 53:32.001
and be a hopeless romantic.

53:36.046 --> 53:37.707
American Trade Bureau.

53:39.817 --> 53:42.650
It's overseas,
a Senator Russell for you.

53:48.826 --> 53:49.815
Hello?

53:52.996 --> 53:55.488
Yes. Yeah.
Yes, I can hear you.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.401
Thank you for telling me.

54:02.139 --> 54:03.732
Goodbye.

54:08.245 --> 54:09.735
We had a boy.

54:11.515 --> 54:15.850
Would you mind if we called him
Edward? If we called him Edward Junior?

54:15.986 --> 54:19.820
I love that. I think it's
perfect. Fit for a king.

54:20.390 --> 54:23.952
That's what I was thinking.
Fit for a king. You like Edward?

54:26.096 --> 54:27.894
I think he likes it.

54:28.999 --> 54:31.229
So, how are you? Are you

54:32.169 --> 54:34.670
saving the world
and keeping us safe?

54:34.671 --> 54:36.003
Sometimes.

54:37.007 --> 54:39.169
What color are his eyes?

54:41.145 --> 54:42.476
Hello?

54:42.746 --> 54:44.043
Hello?

54:51.822 --> 54:53.813
When he's old enough,
you can read it to him.

54:54.758 --> 54:56.317
It's a first edition.

54:56.527 --> 54:59.655
Charles Dickens' A Christmas
Carol. It was my father's.

54:59.830 --> 55:02.265
He would read it to me
when I was a boy.

55:02.733 --> 55:04.098
Thank you.

55:06.136 --> 55:08.764
I had an unfortunate
discovery today.

55:09.606 --> 55:12.408
A man that works for me,
sat just outside my door.

55:12.409 --> 55:16.145
I found out he had given a rose
to a woman with a small note.

55:16.146 --> 55:19.015
The rose was quite lovely,
an Abyssinian rose,

55:19.016 --> 55:23.453
its stem neatly wrapped in silk paper.
All quite beautiful and touching,

55:23.654 --> 55:28.558
save for the fact that the paper was filled
with secret writing for her German friends

55:28.559 --> 55:32.086
detailing changes to the
American order of battle here.

55:33.463 --> 55:34.453
Excuse me, sir.

55:36.233 --> 55:38.224
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

55:39.269 --> 55:41.363
How did the Irish poet say it?

55:41.872 --> 55:46.275
"A friend for today
is tomorrow's heartbreak. "

55:47.211 --> 55:51.841
Do you know what my deepest fear
is? That I will end up friendless.

55:52.849 --> 55:54.511
Completely alone.

55:57.321 --> 55:59.687
I think you two
know each other.

56:00.290 --> 56:02.825
Richard. I didn't expect
to see you. Hello, Edward.

56:02.826 --> 56:05.921
Mr. Hayes has come over to work
with us in Special Operations.

56:06.263 --> 56:10.131
I hope you don't mind, I've invited
him to join our conversation.

56:19.977 --> 56:23.709
I'm afraid our dear English teacher has
a bad habit of making easy friendships.

56:27.351 --> 56:30.912
You know, of course, about
his particular sexual tastes.

56:35.492 --> 56:39.326
I'm afraid he's not been very
discriminating in his partners.

56:39.963 --> 56:43.092
Some people are extremely
worried about his exposure.

56:46.970 --> 56:50.531
I hope you two can help sort this
rather delicate matter out for us.

57:05.923 --> 57:08.491
This seems to me to be a
problem for the British.

57:08.492 --> 57:10.289
Why are we involved?

57:12.095 --> 57:14.621
The British are
a civilized people.

57:14.931 --> 57:18.698
They don't eat their own. They
have somebody do it for them.

57:20.637 --> 57:22.571
So why are you telling me?

57:23.140 --> 57:27.236
I'm giving you an opportunity to
handle it. Or somebody else will.

57:43.827 --> 57:46.228
I'm sorry
you've been brought into this.

57:48.031 --> 57:51.968
If the headmaster won't listen to
reason, you might want to tie your shoe.

57:53.470 --> 57:55.529
I'm sorry
it has to be this way.

57:56.340 --> 57:59.639
It's not something I'm happy
about having to be doing.

58:12.222 --> 58:16.750
Have you thought at all about maybe
going back to teaching again full-time?

58:17.728 --> 58:21.596
They're concerned about my
personal associations, aren't they?

58:22.132 --> 58:24.897
Cambridge boys stick together
like glue.

58:25.836 --> 58:28.430
I'm far too democratic
in my tastes for them.

58:29.473 --> 58:32.499
They like pressed trousers
and proper buttons.

58:34.211 --> 58:37.806
No. I've done all the teaching
I intend to do.

58:39.249 --> 58:40.774
I am who I am.

58:42.652 --> 58:44.314
I'll suffer that.

58:48.492 --> 58:51.723
Please. You've given
all the service that you can.

58:53.263 --> 58:55.061
It's time to retire.

58:58.101 --> 59:00.661
The good schoolboy
will be close by.

59:01.471 --> 59:03.531
He'll want to know
my response.

59:06.777 --> 59:09.803
I understand if you want
to tie your shoe.

59:12.616 --> 59:17.212
It's a dirty business, Edward. I've
been part of it for far too long.

59:37.674 --> 59:41.770
You might want to think about getting
yourself a new pair of shoes, Edward.

59:43.814 --> 59:46.146
There's a wonderful shop
in St. James'.

59:46.483 --> 59:50.818
Mr. Pettibone's.
He's bootmaker to the King.

59:51.955 --> 59:55.186
But then, I suppose we all
are in our own way, aren't we?

59:55.459 --> 59:57.256
Bootmakers to kings.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.828
Get out while you still can.

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:06.826
While you still believe.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.600
While you still have a soul.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:52.312
Hello. Any of you chaps got a light?

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:57.777
I'm sorry.

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:07.750
He knew too much.

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:13.319
You understand.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:39.722
People who really love
each other don't have secrets.

01:02:39.723 --> 01:02:41.457
You are safe here with me.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:43.258
It appears the word
we couldn't make out

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:46.695
had its sound wave significantly
clipped by whoever made this tape.

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:50.189
We restored it by amplifying specific
frequencies seen on the oscilloscope.

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:55.062
Cochinos is Spanish for
"pigs. " Let me hear it again.

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:05.175
And the siren noise we couldn't
pinpoint before were hiding church bells.

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:11.520
For some reason, other noises
were added to distort the bells.

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:14.757
In the makeup table's mirror, you
can actually make out the reflection

01:03:14.758 --> 01:03:16.191
of a church steeple,

01:03:16.192 --> 01:03:19.128
whose three belfries correspond
with the bells you hear.

01:03:21.598 --> 01:03:24.366
The volume indicates that the
church is across the street,

01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:26.700
again, possibly
on a town square.

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:29.934
On the nightstand,
we can see a clock radio.

01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:36.102
It reads almost 10:00, which would
correspond with the church bells.

01:03:36.613 --> 01:03:39.139
I also have audio
of a ceiling fan.

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:44.119
It's a four-blade, standard ceiling
fan. We don't know where it's from.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.781
There is something here.

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:50.324
It could be nothing significant,
maybe a candle, a paperweight.

01:03:50.627 --> 01:03:51.994
Or it may be
something personal

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:54.463
that we could identify
the people in the room with.

01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:57.525
We're going to wash it again,
maybe see what's there.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:02.037
How long
until there's some definition

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:04.166
as to exactly where we are?

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:07.076
We're going
as quickly as we can, sir.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.788
How are Clover and your
little boy? Good, thank you.

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:21.553
You know, he's almost five.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:24.285
You made quite a name
for yourself in London.

01:04:25.662 --> 01:04:27.463
The World War is over.

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:29.064
The war for the world
has just begun.

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:32.367
In every liberated country, there will
be a battle between us and the Russians

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:34.496
for their hearts and minds.

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:39.842
Since we dropped the bomb, they're
feeling a little short between the legs.

01:04:39.843 --> 01:04:43.836
The Russians still live in the
10th century. Beets and potatoes.

01:04:44.314 --> 01:04:48.083
All that will change dramatically.
Right now, they're gobbling up territory,

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:52.886
taking home every scientist they can
steal. In 10 years, they'll have the bomb.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:57.455
We have to get anyone that can be useful
to us out of Berlin before they do.

01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:04.833
Churchill was right.

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:08.031
We shouldn't have stopped
marching until we reached Moscow.

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:12.374
They're from Switzerland.

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:15.504
I had them sent
with the pouch to Berlin.

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:17.880
They're a weakness of mine.

01:05:17.881 --> 01:05:21.442
When I was a child, my mother would
always reward me with a chocolate.

01:05:23.787 --> 01:05:25.414
It's a dreadful habit.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.481
Chocolates
or seeking approval?

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:30.456
Both.

01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:35.722
He was an officer in the Abwehr,
German Military Intelligence.

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:43.172
He says he knows the location of certain
Nazi V-2 rocket scientists in hiding.

01:05:43.173 --> 01:05:45.073
Ask him
where he wants to go.

01:05:48.845 --> 01:05:51.513
He wants to go to Chicago.
He has relatives there.

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:55.083
Tell him if he provides us with the
names and locations of the scientists,

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:57.485
I'll arrange
an exit visa for him.

01:05:57.921 --> 01:06:01.288
As soon as he's served his purpose,
turn him over to the Nazi catchers.

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:16.396
An ex-Waffen-SS Group Commander would
like to speak with you about asylum.

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:22.701
It's very ugly, isn't it?

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:24.970
It isn't meant to be jewelry.

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:29.141
I lost the sound
in one ear altogether.

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:33.222
I can hear with the help of
the apparatus out of this ear,

01:06:33.223 --> 01:06:34.490
but they say
in one year or so...

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:36.254
You hardly notice it's there.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:46.792
The Russians are interested
in making a prisoner swap.

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:16.598
We are prepared to offer you some
Jewish scientists liberated in the East

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:19.626
for some Nazi scientists
you have here in Berlin.

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:30.910
These are the names
we're willing to discuss.

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:10.117
I understand your cryptonym
for me is Ulysses.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.579
Is that for the James Joyce
book or the Greek myth?

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:23.527
Do you know
what our code name is for you?

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:29.202
Mother.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:37.145
I took the first hot bath
yesterday I've taken in three years,

01:08:37.145 --> 01:08:39.809
since the siege of Stalingrad.

01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:43.542
I sat for hours,

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:46.386
looking out the window,

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:48.984
soaking.

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:05.598
When I was a soldier,
my fingers were frostbitten.

01:09:06.943 --> 01:09:09.435
Since then,
when I get cold,

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.906
there is a pain.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:17.317
Maybe you shouldn't live
in Russia.

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:21.550
We all have our weaknesses.

01:09:23.593 --> 01:09:24.924
What is yours?

01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:30.596
I had heard you were silent.

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:34.029
"Made of stone," they said.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:40.041
What is the expression?
"The silence is deafening. "

01:09:44.247 --> 01:09:48.684
You are going to be a
formidable adversary, Mother.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:00.830
I look forward
to our association.

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:05.232
I hope it lasts
for a long time.

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:22.577
I love you.

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:26.854
People who really love
each other don't have secrets.

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:29.658
You are safe here with me.

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:31.860
We were able to make
out the brand of the fan.

01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:34.796
It's called a Froid.
It's Belgian.

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:39.394
The object on the nightstand, we're
still trying to find out what this is.

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:42.501
We just can't get
any more definition out of it.

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:50.005
Who is this?

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:53.008
Who's this?

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:57.076
Hello, Father. You have
a birthday coming up.

01:10:57.386 --> 01:10:58.786
I'm going to be five soon.

01:11:00.156 --> 01:11:01.749
You're a big boy.

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:05.454
I'm bigger than Andrew,
and he's six.

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:12.693
Is your mother there?
What? I can't hear you.

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:17.104
Is your mother there?

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:20.008
She's getting dressed
to go out with her friend.

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:22.569
He has a new car.
He let me drive with him.

01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:27.278
Hello, Mr. Wilson.
This is Edna.

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:30.552
Mrs. Wilson is upstairs.
She's getting ready for dinner.

01:11:30.553 --> 01:11:32.419
I'll tell her
you're on the phone.

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:36.381
I'll call back.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.160
Pardon me.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:49.867
Do you need me for anything
else? No, thank you.

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.745
Do you ever eat, Mr. Carlson?

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:05.310
I like to cook. Would you like
a home-cooked meal?

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:17.126
Have you ever read Ovid?
Metamorphoses in the original Latin?

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:19.991
It's quite beautiful.

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:27.165
"I grabbed a pile of dust
and, holding it up,

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:31.443
"foolishly asked for as many
birthdays as the grains of dust.

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:34.816
"I forgot to ask that
they be years of youth. "

01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:37.550
Bravo.

01:12:51.234 --> 01:12:52.826
I should be going.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:02.469
Would you like to stay?

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:07.409
Would you like me to?

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:11.113
I would like you to
very much.

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:23.198
Maybe we could go
somewhere together?

01:13:23.199 --> 01:13:25.292
The lakes in Bavaria
are still beautiful.

01:13:26.636 --> 01:13:30.971
There was an inn there before the war
where they served breakfast in bed all day.

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:56.659
Hanna?

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:01.903
I hope
you never go home.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.732
Bavaria is really
a beautiful place.

01:14:08.411 --> 01:14:12.404
I was born there.
My grandmother lived there.

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:15.477
I really miss her.

01:14:17.253 --> 01:14:18.880
Why don't we go?

01:14:34.103 --> 01:14:36.470
I let a stranger
into our house.

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:50.042
Mother! Father's here! Mother!

01:15:57.186 --> 01:15:58.517
Hello, Edward.

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:01.713
Hello, Clover.

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:05.850
I...

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.665
I like to be called
Margaret now.

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:16.129
It's very nice to see you.

01:16:17.773 --> 01:16:19.503
It's good to see you, too.

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:24.743
I made something for you.

01:16:28.851 --> 01:16:31.115
See? It's a ship.

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:35.554
But it's got
the flag of England.

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:40.389
And then I put
a pirate flag there.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:43.194
And if you like,
you can count

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:45.824
how many sails there are.

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:48.367
You want to try that?

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:55.005
Fifteen.

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:56.609
That's right.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:58.611
Fifteen.

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:02.710
No, no, it's yours.
I made it for you.

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:20.193
If it's all right with you,

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:23.338
I thought maybe we could sleep
in separate beds for a while,

01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:25.830
just until we get
to know each other again.

01:17:27.243 --> 01:17:29.143
I made up the spare room.

01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:31.577
All right.

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:43.054
What do you hear
from your brother John?

01:17:46.195 --> 01:17:49.494
I thought you knew. He was
killed in Burma, in 1044.

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:54.727
You never mentioned it
in any of your letters.

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:59.401
There wasn't very much to say.

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:09.575
Six years is a long time.

01:18:13.389 --> 01:18:16.586
I was lonely
and I was with a man once.

01:18:20.195 --> 01:18:22.027
He wasn't very interesting.

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:27.559
Were you with anyone?

01:18:30.406 --> 01:18:32.238
It was a mistake.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:51.625
Thank you for the ship
you made for me.

01:18:54.997 --> 01:18:56.328
You're welcome.

01:18:57.299 --> 01:18:58.960
I'm glad you like it.

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:03.504
Mother said
you were in the war.

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:06.407
Did you fight?
Did you kill anybody?

01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:11.611
No.

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:17.776
Good night.
Good night.

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:37.701
No! You're it!

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:41.105
Hello, Father.
Hello, Edward. Hello.

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:42.610
Hello, dear.

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:44.079
There's somebody waiting
for you in the den.

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:48.379
General.

01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:51.684
Edward.

01:19:53.322 --> 01:19:56.781
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this.
Your wife kindly helped me to a drink.

01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:01.896
My feet, they keep
cutting off pieces of them.

01:20:01.897 --> 01:20:04.730
It's not dignified for men to
have to die from the feet up.

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:14.106
Well, while everybody's been
feeling good about themselves,

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:18.112
the Soviets, without firing a shot,
have taken over half the world.

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:19.747
They're breathing
down our necks.

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:21.774
They'll be in our backyard
before you know it.

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:23.318
So, I've been telling
the President

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:25.720
about the need to create a new
Foreign Intelligence Service.

01:20:25.721 --> 01:20:28.383
One that would do in peacetime
what OSS did during the war.

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:33.094
Phillip Allen will be heading the
agency. Richard Hayes will be his exec.

01:20:33.095 --> 01:20:34.729
And you'll be taking
Division C,

01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:37.392
special operations that report
only to the Director.

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:40.234
It would be limited
to overseas, obviously.

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:43.967
Subversive operations,
intelligence gathering and analysis.

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:47.371
And I'd be interested
in your thoughts about this.

01:20:47.976 --> 01:20:51.546
Particularly in your area of
expertise, counterintelligence.

01:20:51.547 --> 01:20:54.115
I'd be glad to help
in any way I can.

01:20:54.116 --> 01:20:55.283
That's all right.

01:20:55.284 --> 01:20:57.275
Edward, go outside.

01:20:59.121 --> 01:21:01.146
Excuse me, sir. Margaret!

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:04.920
Come on, Edward.

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.586
Come. Let's go outside,
all right? Daddy's busy.

01:21:10.566 --> 01:21:11.897
Thank you.

01:21:20.843 --> 01:21:24.912
I have to tell you, I have some
real problems with this whole thing,

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:26.848
despite how much we need it.

01:21:27.783 --> 01:21:31.586
I'm concerned that too much power
will end up in the hands of too few.

01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:35.356
It's always in somebody's best interest
to promote enemies, real or imagined.

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:40.420
I see this as America's eyes and ears. I
don't want it to become its heart and soul.

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:44.031
So I told the President,
for this to work,

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:46.763
there's gonna have to be some
kind of civilian oversight.

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:48.526
Oversight?

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:51.205
How can you have
a covert organization

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:53.441
if you have people looking
over your shoulder?

01:21:53.442 --> 01:21:57.379
You know who gave Hitler his power?
The clerks and the bookkeepers.

01:21:57.513 --> 01:21:59.071
The civil servants.

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:02.042
I have this one weakness.

01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:04.383
I believe in a just God.

01:22:05.387 --> 01:22:08.152
I always seem to err
on the side of democracy.

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:17.665
This must be a nice place
to raise a family.

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:19.498
I never made the time.

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:22.402
I'll be dead
in less than a year.

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:27.002
I love this country.

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:30.276
We all do, sir. We all do.

01:22:40.022 --> 01:22:43.856
No matter what anyone tells you,
there'll be no one you can really trust.

01:22:47.863 --> 01:22:51.891
I'm afraid when all is said and
done, we're all just clerks, too.

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:15.823
I was under the impression that
Dr. Ibanez supported a democracy.

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:18.159
I'm afraid
he's changed his mind.

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.728
The doctor's started to
believe his own propaganda.

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:23.564
I mean, you dreamed this guy up,
Edward, helped get him elected.

01:23:23.565 --> 01:23:24.932
Those are the Soviets.

01:23:24.933 --> 01:23:27.068
International Department
of Central Committee members

01:23:27.069 --> 01:23:29.670
Trubnikov, Kushelnikov,

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:32.740
who have become overly interested
in their natural resources,

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:34.106
particularly coffee.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:38.814
Our economic interests
are being compromised,

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:43.209
to say nothing of the dangers of
a Soviet presence so close to home.

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:48.613
For security, Edward, we must
establish our own presence there.

01:23:49.191 --> 01:23:51.182
Wait, stop. Can you go back?

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:53.961
Go back a little bit.

01:23:57.599 --> 01:23:59.295
Run it from there.

01:24:13.949 --> 01:24:15.783
I just thought
I saw something.

01:24:15.784 --> 01:24:18.386
I want you two to put your
heads together on this.

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:21.822
Michael will be going down there
as an agricultural specialist

01:24:21.823 --> 01:24:24.759
with the Mayan Coffee Company.
Non-official.

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.995
He'll be our eyes and ears.

01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:30.056
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.

01:24:30.332 --> 01:24:31.766
Good luck.
Thank you.

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:35.169
I wouldn't wear
my class ring down there.

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:36.404
Yes, sir. Of course.

01:24:36.405 --> 01:24:40.501
I want all intelligence on this
sent directly to me and no one else.

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:46.408
I believe that's
what you're looking for.

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.275
That'll do it.

01:25:43.372 --> 01:25:47.536
Mr. Wilson? This came for you
through the Carlson cover address.

01:25:48.744 --> 01:25:50.439
There was no card.

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:45.900
There's been a potential
compromise down south.

01:26:45.901 --> 01:26:47.232
Ulysses.

01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:50.071
We can't wait
another 24 hours.

01:26:50.072 --> 01:26:53.908
If you can guarantee that all assets are
in place and prepared to move on my order,

01:26:53.909 --> 01:26:56.070
I'm prepared to move as well.

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:02.043
Come back to bed.

01:27:02.951 --> 01:27:04.646
What were you talking about?

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:06.650
It's grown-up talk.

01:27:07.756 --> 01:27:09.451
I had a nightmare.

01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:11.517
Everything's fine.

01:27:14.463 --> 01:27:16.488
Could you stay with me
another minute?

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:22.400
Try to get some sleep.

01:27:25.474 --> 01:27:26.702
Yes?

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:31.502
We haven't got time to be sure on this.
This whole thing hinges on support.

01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:34.782
If we don't have the support,
I can't guarantee the outcome.

01:27:34.783 --> 01:27:36.751
Can you guarantee
the support?

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:40.922
That's not a guarantee.
That's not an answer.

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:46.025
Do what you have to do.
These men aren't ideological.

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:49.296
Put more in their Christmas
stockings, and they'll fall into place.

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:52.927
Call the station chief.
Get him out of bed.

01:27:53.335 --> 01:27:55.599
Margaret tells us that
you work with the CIA.

01:27:58.607 --> 01:28:00.973
My wife has
a vivid imagination.

01:28:01.343 --> 01:28:04.039
I'm a trade advisor.
A civil servant.

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:15.546
Good night.
Good night.

01:28:23.465 --> 01:28:24.832
How dare you speak
to me that way?

01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:26.567
You are never to tell anybody
what I do.

01:28:26.568 --> 01:28:29.136
How dare you? Those people are my
friends! I don't have a lot of friends!

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:32.339
You are never to tell anyone what it
is I do. Never. Do you understand me?

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:34.575
What you do? What you do?
I don't know what you do!

01:28:34.576 --> 01:28:37.077
You leave at five, you're
home at ten, seven days a week.

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:38.546
You don't say
a damn word to me!

01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:41.482
I live with a ghost!
I don't know what you do!

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:50.689
Call back.

01:28:57.933 --> 01:29:00.493
They're ready.
Launch the operation.

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:03.103
Say something.

01:29:03.471 --> 01:29:05.472
Say something.
I have to go now.

01:29:05.473 --> 01:29:08.375
Say something! Talk to me!
Say something!

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:10.436
Look at me. Say something.

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:41.965
Remember what I said. Don't
touch anything. All right?

01:29:45.347 --> 01:29:48.182
Merry Christmas, Margaret.
Edward. Merry Christmas.

01:29:48.183 --> 01:29:49.917
Is this young Edward?

01:29:49.918 --> 01:29:53.513
Would you like to come inside and meet
our very special guest this evening?

01:29:57.859 --> 01:29:59.520
Santa Claus.

01:29:59.728 --> 01:30:01.495
Would you like to meet Santa? Yeah.

01:30:01.496 --> 01:30:02.725
Come along.

01:30:03.198 --> 01:30:05.866
Toddy is wonderful with
children. Yes, she is.

01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:07.665
Come and meet Santa.

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:12.907
Would you like a drink,
Edward? Thank you.

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:17.073
I believe
congratulations are in order.

01:30:18.013 --> 01:30:21.540
The doctor has no more
patients because of malpractice.

01:30:24.486 --> 01:30:26.249
Gentlemen.
Edward.

01:30:30.058 --> 01:30:31.321
Phillip.

01:30:31.493 --> 01:30:32.653
Bill.

01:30:33.061 --> 01:30:34.392
Gentlemen,

01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:38.327
you can all be very proud
of what you've started.

01:30:41.803 --> 01:30:42.937
Merry Christmas.

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:45.133
Merry Christmas, Bill.
Merry Christmas.

01:30:54.816 --> 01:30:56.807
Christmas
is full of surprises.

01:30:57.352 --> 01:30:59.343
Do you like surprises
under the tree?

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:04.692
Well, we'll make sure
you have lots of surprises

01:31:05.193 --> 01:31:07.025
and things like that. Okay?

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:10.030
I'm sure Mom and Dad agree
that that would be a good idea.

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:13.067
Surprises are the best part
of Christmas, don't you think?

01:31:13.068 --> 01:31:16.196
How about games?

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:20.372
How about ball games?

01:31:24.045 --> 01:31:26.113
Can I get you a towel?
I'm so sorry.

01:31:26.114 --> 01:31:28.115
Are you all right?

01:31:28.116 --> 01:31:29.516
All right. It's all right.

01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:31.151
Can you take me
home, please?

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:32.953
I think we should go home.
Lower your voice.

01:31:32.954 --> 01:31:35.689
You can use our bath if you'd
like. I might have some dry clothes.

01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:38.751
Thank you. Come with me, Edward.
It's all right. Come with me.

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.985
Can I help you up,
Mrs. Wilson?

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:44.291
Did you know that
Phillip is going to be

01:32:44.292 --> 01:32:46.852
on the Mayan Coffee Company's
board of directors?

01:32:49.697 --> 01:32:52.428
Remember what I said to you
about friends.

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:06.637
You look good, Edward.

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:10.280
How long has it been?
Seven, eight years?

01:33:11.186 --> 01:33:13.347
A lot of water
under the bridge.

01:33:15.957 --> 01:33:18.824
Carolyn and I, we just
bought our first house.

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:22.829
And everything's already broken.
I spend my weekends fixing things.

01:33:23.031 --> 01:33:27.468
By the time I get everything fixed,
it'll be time to sell the fucking house.

01:33:29.037 --> 01:33:32.006
Maybe you can give me
a heads-up on somebody.

01:33:37.245 --> 01:33:40.747
You're asking me to give you
FBI files on an American citizen?

01:33:40.748 --> 01:33:44.048
You know I can't do that. It's
against the law to spy on citizens.

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:46.851
Keep it.

01:33:47.055 --> 01:33:49.217
Maybe someday
you'll change your mind.

01:34:17.152 --> 01:34:18.676
May I come in?

01:34:32.834 --> 01:34:35.326
You know, I've never
been in your office.

01:34:36.437 --> 01:34:38.235
How was the fishing?

01:34:39.107 --> 01:34:41.940
It was a bad year.
The water is too high.

01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:45.145
I understand you wanted to

01:34:45.146 --> 01:34:48.582
personally give me the
Operation Zapata list yourself.

01:34:52.687 --> 01:34:54.451
There isn't one, is there?

01:34:58.726 --> 01:35:00.594
You know it was
a silent operation.

01:35:00.595 --> 01:35:02.586
It wasn't silent enough.

01:35:07.302 --> 01:35:11.762
I've been asked by the President to
suggest who we no longer need with us.

01:35:15.343 --> 01:35:17.511
Who would you recommend,
Edward?

01:35:17.512 --> 01:35:19.708
I serve at the pleasure
of the Director, sir.

01:35:21.516 --> 01:35:23.416
I'm just a gatekeeper.

01:35:24.819 --> 01:35:28.016
And why is it that people
like us choose to serve,

01:35:28.823 --> 01:35:31.952
for nickels a day,
in a profession that makes us

01:35:32.393 --> 01:35:35.795
constantly look over our
shoulder to see who's watching us?

01:35:36.464 --> 01:35:38.262
When will you
make your decision?

01:35:41.269 --> 01:35:42.566
Decision?

01:35:46.174 --> 01:35:50.167
I serve at the discretion of the
President of the United States.

01:35:51.379 --> 01:35:54.508
I will do what I think
is best for the country.

01:36:00.989 --> 01:36:04.652
It's important that
we find out who's responsible.

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:10.220
Good night.
Good night.

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:27.378
At 2242, call received on Berlin
base chief's operational line.

01:36:27.548 --> 01:36:31.451
Man says he's senior officer,
KGB. Would not give name.

01:36:32.153 --> 01:36:33.814
Open up. Thanks.

01:36:39.427 --> 01:36:42.496
"KGB officer asks when
Mr. Edward Wilson is coming.

01:36:42.497 --> 01:36:45.330
"He wants to know
Mr. Edward Wilson's response. "

01:36:45.767 --> 01:36:47.928
Tell him
Mr. Edward Wilson is here,

01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:51.500
and would like to know what he
intends to provide us with in return.

01:36:57.679 --> 01:37:00.180
He says,
"In return for safe journey,

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:03.183
"he will provide Mr. Wilson
with clear understanding

01:37:03.184 --> 01:37:06.176
"of last three losses

"penetrations

01:37:14.829 --> 01:37:18.129
"He will also speak personally
with Mr. Edward Wilson about

01:37:19.734 --> 01:37:21.065
"Ulysses.

01:37:21.903 --> 01:37:24.269
"Things only he knows
of Ulysses,

01:37:24.405 --> 01:37:26.931
"how he thinks,
what he plans to do,

01:37:27.575 --> 01:37:31.569
"and what he wants Mr. Edward
Wilson to think he is doing.

"and would be more than happy

01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:58.234
Ulysses.

01:38:02.744 --> 01:38:04.974
Ask him what his weakness is.

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:20.550
"The cold. "

01:38:22.797 --> 01:38:24.458
Let's get him over here.

01:38:25.166 --> 01:38:28.795
My name is
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov.

01:38:29.337 --> 01:38:32.906
My children's names are
Anatoly and Sergei.

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:37.344
My father played the cello. I
play the violin. But you know this.

01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:41.848
I risk my life to come all the way to tell
you this, to confirm what you already know.

01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:43.750
You failed the polygraph,
Mr. Mironov.

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:46.015
You know every Russian
fails polygraph.

01:38:47.255 --> 01:38:50.122
Your polygraph doesn't
understand the Russian soul.

01:38:54.829 --> 01:38:59.494
What more do you want? I've given
you my bonafides, the names of agents,

01:38:59.934 --> 01:39:03.336
w£o has been compromised,
who you need to know about.

01:39:04.205 --> 01:39:06.833
I want to speak to
Mr. Edward Wilson.

01:39:07.809 --> 01:39:10.377
We were told Mironov was with these
men the day the photo was taken.

01:39:10.378 --> 01:39:11.878
Your immediate superior?

01:39:11.879 --> 01:39:13.880
We're not even sure that any
of the circled men are him.

01:39:13.881 --> 01:39:16.817
I told you this three times
already. Sergei Budanov.

01:39:17.185 --> 01:39:19.619
I want to speak to
Mr. Edward Wilson.

01:39:24.325 --> 01:39:25.986
I would like some tea.

01:39:29.831 --> 01:39:31.164
There isn't any.

01:39:31.165 --> 01:39:33.327
I get thirsty
when I say too much.

01:39:33.568 --> 01:39:36.537
You going to keep up this inane
questioning for much longer?

01:39:37.839 --> 01:39:41.275
There's nothing you've told us
we don't know, Mr. Mironov.

01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:44.678
I think you better try
a little harder.

01:39:44.679 --> 01:39:48.445
I didn't come here to deal
with children, Mr. Edison.

01:39:49.050 --> 01:39:50.711
Or is it Mr. Brocco?

01:39:53.154 --> 01:39:55.145
We do our homework, too.

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:07.759
Hello, Mr. Mironov.
I'm Mr. Wilson.

01:40:13.307 --> 01:40:14.832
Hello, Mother.

01:40:17.812 --> 01:40:22.807
Ulysses is obsessed with you. Night
and day, you are always on his mind.

01:40:23.885 --> 01:40:25.477
He trusts nobody.

01:40:25.653 --> 01:40:29.385
The only one whom he lets
close is his aide, Sasha.

01:40:30.258 --> 01:40:33.557
He is methodical, he plans
things years in advance.

01:40:34.495 --> 01:40:37.364
For instance, you should know
he has developed a friendship

01:40:37.365 --> 01:40:39.492
with a certain
neighbor of yours.

01:40:39.834 --> 01:40:43.862
Fidel Castro. A young man
he has high hopes for.

01:40:44.438 --> 01:40:48.170
I understand you had a most
interesting fish swim your way.

01:40:48.576 --> 01:40:52.245
Mr. Allen thought it might be
possible for me to speak with him.

01:40:52.246 --> 01:40:54.681
With you as the chaperone,
of course.

01:40:54.682 --> 01:40:56.983
I brought him a little gift
I'm sure he'll appreciate.

01:40:56.984 --> 01:40:59.146
Send Mironov in immediately.

01:40:59.921 --> 01:41:02.287
It'll be nice to be closely
working with you again.

01:41:02.590 --> 01:41:06.891
I expect you to show me Washington.
We can paint the town red together.

01:41:08.863 --> 01:41:11.264
Valentin Mironov,
Arch Cummings.

01:41:11.399 --> 01:41:14.401
It is a great pleasure
to meet you. My pleasure.

01:41:14.402 --> 01:41:15.502
Now, please sit down.

01:41:15.503 --> 01:41:18.836
It's nice to have someone like
you on our side of the street.

01:41:20.274 --> 01:41:22.208
I thought you may enjoy this.

01:41:22.443 --> 01:41:25.276
It's something you might appreciate.
I hope you haven't read it.

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:28.448
Very clever.

01:41:29.984 --> 01:41:31.418
Thank you.

01:41:34.388 --> 01:41:36.721
All Russia is our orchard.

01:41:37.158 --> 01:41:39.524
The land is great
and beautiful.

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:42.729
There are many
wonderful places in it.

01:41:42.730 --> 01:41:44.391
Think, Anya.

01:41:44.565 --> 01:41:47.033
Your grandfather,
your great-grandfather...

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:51.301
This is a very bad translation.
It is much funnier in Russian.

01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:55.909
And now, doesn't
something human look at you

01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:58.072
from every cherry
in the orchard?

01:41:58.512 --> 01:42:00.742
From every leaf
and every stalk?

01:42:01.682 --> 01:42:04.015
Don't you hear their voices?

01:42:05.019 --> 01:42:08.387
It's awful.
Your orchard is terrible!

01:42:08.723 --> 01:42:11.591
And when in the evening or at night,
when you walk through the orchard

01:42:11.592 --> 01:42:14.027
and the old bark glows
with the dim light

01:42:14.028 --> 01:42:17.063
and the old cherry trees seem
to be dreaming of all that was

01:42:17.064 --> 01:42:19.966
a hundred, two hundred years ago, and
are repressed by their heavy visions.

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:21.628
I'm due at a meeting.

01:42:21.936 --> 01:42:25.372
We've left those 200 years behind us,
but so far, we gained nothing at all.

01:42:25.606 --> 01:42:28.200
We don't yet know
what the past is to be to us.

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:34.144
We only philosophize. We complain
that we are dull, or we drink vodka.

01:42:34.949 --> 01:42:38.084
For it's so clear that in order
to begin to live in the present,

01:42:38.085 --> 01:42:39.951
we must first redeem the past.

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:47.050
Are you Laura?

01:42:47.762 --> 01:42:49.062
What?

01:42:49.063 --> 01:42:52.192
Are you Laura? I'm supposed to
offer you a ride.

01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:17.448
Hello, Edward.

01:43:18.693 --> 01:43:20.024
Hello, Laura.

01:43:21.762 --> 01:43:23.594
Why all the mystery?

01:43:27.034 --> 01:43:28.866
Do you have children?

01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:30.697
I have a boy.

01:43:31.672 --> 01:43:33.504
Edward Junior.

01:43:38.179 --> 01:43:39.840
Do you have anybody?

01:43:43.684 --> 01:43:45.084
A cat.

01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:53.722
I've often imagined what my life
would have been like with you.

01:43:55.262 --> 01:43:57.288
And what did you imagine?

01:43:58.566 --> 01:44:00.625
I thought you might teach.

01:44:01.235 --> 01:44:02.862
Probably poetry.

01:44:04.805 --> 01:44:07.570
I saw us living
in a small college town.

01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:27.557
You once said to me you were afraid your
life was already planned out for you.

01:44:31.732 --> 01:44:33.894
Are you doing
what you want to do?

01:44:36.570 --> 01:44:38.800
My life has been
full of surprises.

01:45:05.132 --> 01:45:07.192
You owe me
a day at the beach.

01:45:51.212 --> 01:45:53.043
How long do you think
you'll be?

01:45:53.681 --> 01:45:55.478
As long as it takes.

01:46:00.087 --> 01:46:02.852
I think maybe I'll go ahead. All right.

01:46:07.061 --> 01:46:10.224
Nothing else
is built the same

01:46:10.397 --> 01:46:14.033
Nothing in the world

01:46:14.034 --> 01:46:17.004
As the soft
and wavy frame...

01:46:18.372 --> 01:46:19.601
Mother?

01:46:21.976 --> 01:46:24.240
There was an envelope for you
on the desk.

01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:27.647
You look lovely.

01:46:27.648 --> 01:46:29.480
Thank you, darling.

01:47:17.531 --> 01:47:19.899
It's not enough that you
ignore me our whole life?

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:21.534
You have to humiliate me?
Margaret, please.

01:47:21.535 --> 01:47:23.265
You disgust me!
Calm down, darling.

01:47:23.637 --> 01:47:24.798
You're disgusting!

01:47:50.664 --> 01:47:52.155
We'll start from the last.

01:47:55.035 --> 01:47:57.003
So suppose
the dame ain't right

01:47:57.004 --> 01:47:58.733
Or completely
free from flaws

01:48:25.132 --> 01:48:27.123
Mother forgot
some of her things.

01:48:39.646 --> 01:48:41.308
I'll see you at home.

01:49:40.974 --> 01:49:42.465
Are you Laura?

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:44.877
Yes.

01:49:44.878 --> 01:49:47.040
I was asked to give you this.

01:49:59.993 --> 01:50:03.429
In an unprecedented effort
to improve U.S. -Soviet ties,

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:06.866
Premier Khrushchev began his 1·-day
tour of the United States today.

01:50:06.867 --> 01:50:09.669
The visit will start with a
tour by President Eisenhower

01:50:09.670 --> 01:50:10.970
of our nation's capital,

01:50:10.971 --> 01:50:13.873
followed by a highly anticipated
speech at the United Nations.

01:50:13.874 --> 01:50:15.675
All right,
now set it down.

01:50:15.676 --> 01:50:18.978
Following that, the Soviet Premier
will travel across the country

01:50:18.979 --> 01:50:20.413
to more casual destinations,

01:50:20.414 --> 01:50:24.407
including America's mighty steel mills,
wheat farms, and, yes, Disneyland.

01:50:25.252 --> 01:50:28.187
President Eisenhower greeted
Mr. Khrushchev this morning

01:50:28.188 --> 01:50:30.490
at Andrews Air Force Base,
as they prepare to discuss...

01:50:30.491 --> 01:50:31.791
It's perfect.

01:50:31.792 --> 01:50:34.327
...t£e ever-threatening
military build-up by the Reds.

01:50:34.328 --> 01:50:37.363
Our glee club's been chosen to
compete in a national competition.

01:50:37.364 --> 01:50:39.332
Now, back to
The Classical Hour.

01:50:39.333 --> 01:50:41.165
Would you come with me?

01:50:42.002 --> 01:50:43.663
Would you like me to?

01:50:44.338 --> 01:50:45.965
Yeah, very much.

01:51:20.541 --> 01:51:21.974
I'll get your things.

01:51:25.045 --> 01:51:26.706
It's good
to have you home.

01:51:53.073 --> 01:51:54.768
How was your trip?

01:51:55.242 --> 01:51:57.233
Smooth as silk.

01:51:57.411 --> 01:52:01.677
My FBI escort made the
trip here very pleasant.

01:52:15.228 --> 01:52:17.060
Which one is your son?

01:52:18.365 --> 01:52:20.629
Top row, third from the right.

01:52:22.369 --> 01:52:25.395
He's a handsome young man.
My congratulations.

01:52:27.274 --> 01:52:30.039
We're particularly concerned
about Cuba.

01:52:31.545 --> 01:52:33.206
Your friend,

01:52:34.381 --> 01:52:35.871
he's too close to home.

01:52:36.016 --> 01:52:39.042
You don't appreciate
him breathing down your neck.

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:42.947
If we continue down this road,

01:52:43.557 --> 01:52:45.889
there will be
a Third World War.

01:52:46.126 --> 01:52:48.894
I don't think
either of us wants a real war.

01:52:48.895 --> 01:52:51.296
What would we do
for a living then?

01:52:54.401 --> 01:52:56.733
If he keeps
calling attention to himself,

01:52:56.903 --> 01:53:00.965
at some point, we may be
forced to send him a surprise.

01:53:01.842 --> 01:53:04.844
Now, I don't want that to come
as a surprise to your people.

01:53:04.845 --> 01:53:07.007
He is very important to us.

01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:10.912
We would not like
to be surprised.

01:53:16.556 --> 01:53:17.819
Be well.

01:53:20.927 --> 01:53:22.259
Be well.

01:53:38.712 --> 01:53:43.775
I am today announcing my candidacy for
the Presidency of the United States.

01:53:44.818 --> 01:53:48.587
The Presidency is the most
powerful office in the free world.

01:53:48.588 --> 01:53:52.855
Through its leadership can come a
more vital life for all of our people.

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:57.520
In it are centered the hopes of
the globe around us, for freedom

01:53:57.764 --> 01:53:59.698
and a more secure life.

01:53:59.966 --> 01:54:02.802
Senator Kennedy, if you don't
win the Presidential nomination,

01:54:02.803 --> 01:54:04.837
will you accept
the Vice Presidency?

01:54:04.838 --> 01:54:08.074
I shall not, under any conditions,
be a candidate for Vice President.

01:54:08.075 --> 01:54:13.707
If I fail in this endeavor, I shall return
and serve in the United States Senate.

01:54:14.681 --> 01:54:17.016
We have a secure circuit
with Stockholm station.

01:54:17.017 --> 01:54:20.019
Station reports they have a colonel,
Directorate K, counterintelligence.

01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:21.351
Do we have a name?

01:54:21.922 --> 01:54:23.322
May I help you, sir?

01:54:23.323 --> 01:54:26.592
I'm a colonel with KGB.
I'm requesting asylum.

01:54:26.593 --> 01:54:27.924
What is your name?

01:54:28.762 --> 01:54:31.595
My name is
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov.

01:54:40.207 --> 01:54:43.370
My name is
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov.

01:54:43.977 --> 01:54:46.612
This other man who says
he is Valentin Mironov

01:54:46.613 --> 01:54:48.479
is not who he pretends to be.

01:54:48.615 --> 01:54:50.015
All right?
His real name is Yuri Modin.

01:54:51.718 --> 01:54:54.487
He was Ulysses' right
hand. He is Ulysses' mole.

01:54:54.488 --> 01:54:56.854
Just tell me your real name.

01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:59.850
It is just Ulysses
trying to discredit me.

01:55:00.961 --> 01:55:02.519
Just tell me your real name.

01:55:02.696 --> 01:55:07.190
My real name is
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov.

01:55:09.002 --> 01:55:11.664
I was born
in Bobruisk in 1024.

01:55:11.838 --> 01:55:14.306
Attended the State Institute
of International Relations.

01:55:14.307 --> 01:55:16.575
Served for three years
in Naval Intelligence.

01:55:16.576 --> 01:55:19.045
My wife's name is
Tamara Markovskaya.

01:55:19.212 --> 01:55:22.079
My children's names are
Anatoly and Sergei.

01:55:23.150 --> 01:55:26.643
My father is a cellist.
I play the violin.

01:55:28.355 --> 01:55:30.187
All I want is my freedom.

01:55:36.196 --> 01:55:37.527
Pick him up.

01:55:39.166 --> 01:55:40.656
You all right?

01:55:41.134 --> 01:55:43.797
I'm sorry.
You see what you made me do?

01:55:44.204 --> 01:55:46.673
Nowjust tell me the truth.

01:55:50.110 --> 01:55:53.671
Because we're going to be here
as long as it takes.

01:55:53.947 --> 01:55:56.282
I already told you the truth.
I want to know the truth.

01:55:56.283 --> 01:55:58.417
You know my name.
Tell me your real name.

01:55:58.418 --> 01:56:00.586
Mister, please,
I'm not lying.

01:56:00.587 --> 01:56:03.289
I'd like to believe you, but I
don't believe you. Understand?

01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:04.723
Now, tell me your name.

01:56:04.724 --> 01:56:08.561
My name is Mironov. It's
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov.

01:56:08.562 --> 01:56:09.895
That's your name?
Yeah.

01:56:09.896 --> 01:56:11.997
That's your real name.
Yes. This is my name.

01:56:11.998 --> 01:56:13.866
Tell me your name.
I told you my name.

01:56:13.867 --> 01:56:15.868
I told you a hundred times.

01:56:15.869 --> 01:56:18.037
We're not going anywhere.
I just want you to know that.

01:56:18.038 --> 01:56:21.106
We are not going anywhere. Today,
tomorrow, next week, next month.

01:56:21.107 --> 01:56:23.609
Yuri Modin. He is your mole.
I am not your mole.

01:56:23.610 --> 01:56:24.944
You understand? I cannot
tell you anything else.

01:56:24.945 --> 01:56:26.712
I'm gonna be right in front
of you. The same position.

01:56:26.713 --> 01:56:28.380
This is my name.
What is your name?

01:56:28.381 --> 01:56:30.549
My name is Valentin Gregorievich
Mironov. This is my name.

01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:32.211
Tell me your name.

01:56:32.652 --> 01:56:34.053
I don't have
a different name.

01:56:34.054 --> 01:56:35.385
Tell it.
I don't have it.

01:56:35.522 --> 01:56:37.156
Tell it to me again.
This is my name.

01:56:37.157 --> 01:56:38.624
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov.
Tell it to me again.

01:56:38.625 --> 01:56:42.027
Valentin Gregorievich...
Tell me your fucking name!

01:56:42.028 --> 01:56:43.495
Mironov!

01:56:43.496 --> 01:56:46.065
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov!
We are gonna be here a long time.

01:56:46.066 --> 01:56:48.334
This is my name!

01:56:48.335 --> 01:56:50.336
It's Valentin Mironov!

01:56:50.337 --> 01:56:52.838
Shut up! Shut up! I told you!
I don't have a different...

01:56:52.839 --> 01:56:56.342
Tell me your name!

01:56:56.343 --> 01:57:00.143
Tell me your fucking name!

01:57:00.947 --> 01:57:03.280
Tell me your name!
Tell me your name!

01:57:05.518 --> 01:57:07.612
Come on, tear it ort
Get it o·

01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:12.122
Put him down.

01:57:20.066 --> 01:57:21.557
Your name.

01:57:21.935 --> 01:57:23.266
What is your name?

01:57:27.641 --> 01:57:29.542
Tell me your name.

01:57:42.756 --> 01:57:45.247
What is your name?

01:57:46.092 --> 01:57:49.028
Sir, this is
lysergic acid diethylamide.

01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:51.356
It's called LSD.

01:57:53.366 --> 01:57:56.598
We've had some very favorable
results as a truth serum.

01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:39.274
Look, it's him. Papa.

01:59:17.617 --> 01:59:19.551
Soviet power is a myth.

01:59:23.623 --> 01:59:25.114
A great show,

01:59:25.291 --> 01:59:28.394
but there are no spare parts.
Nothing is working.

01:59:28.395 --> 01:59:31.455
It's nothing but painted rust.

01:59:36.202 --> 01:59:37.431
But you.

01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:42.474
You need to keep
the Russian myth alive

01:59:42.475 --> 01:59:45.741
to maintain your
military-industrial complex.

01:59:46.312 --> 01:59:50.306
Your system depends on Russia
being perceived as a mortal threat.

01:59:52.619 --> 01:59:54.280
It's not a threat.

01:59:55.955 --> 02:00:00.154
It was never a threat.
It will never be a threat.

02:00:02.762 --> 02:00:04.093
It is

02:00:04.931 --> 02:00:06.262
a rotted,

02:00:06.933 --> 02:00:08.424
bloated

02:00:09.436 --> 02:00:10.767
cow.

02:00:22.615 --> 02:00:23.947
I am

02:00:24.284 --> 02:00:26.946
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov

02:00:28.455 --> 02:00:31.151
and I am free.

02:00:37.063 --> 02:00:39.589
Shit. Shit!

02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:55.541
If you would like,

02:00:56.583 --> 02:00:59.552
I'll be willing to take
the truth serum, Edward.

02:01:02.088 --> 02:01:04.079
I've nothing to hide.

02:01:05.692 --> 02:01:07.683
I am who I say I am.

02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:16.332
I know.

02:01:33.253 --> 02:01:36.522
We send those who are leaving
us to go into the world

02:01:36.523 --> 02:01:39.356
with the knowledge,
wherever they go,

02:01:39.859 --> 02:01:42.795
whatever they do,
they will never be alone.

02:01:43.496 --> 02:01:45.760
They will always be one of us.

02:01:46.466 --> 02:01:48.800
And we say,
Bonesmen, all here.

02:01:48.801 --> 02:01:50.292
All here.
All here.

02:02:01.114 --> 02:02:03.105
I didn't know you smoked.

02:02:04.284 --> 02:02:06.616
There are a few things
you don't know about me.

02:02:14.961 --> 02:02:17.328
I've spoken
to a recruiter here.

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:20.997
I would like very much
to join CIA.

02:02:22.001 --> 02:02:24.971
There are a lot of things
you can do, Edward.

02:02:25.805 --> 02:02:27.806
I'd like you to think
about this very carefully.

02:02:27.807 --> 02:02:30.075
I have thought about it
carefully. It's what I want to do.

02:02:30.076 --> 02:02:31.441
I want to join the Agency.

02:02:34.314 --> 02:02:35.881
I want to
make you proud of me.

02:02:35.882 --> 02:02:37.549
I am proud of you.

02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:39.780
I've made up my mind, Father.

02:02:42.055 --> 02:02:43.716
You can stop him.

02:02:44.691 --> 02:02:47.226
He doesn't understand what he's
getting into. You can stop him.

02:02:47.227 --> 02:02:48.927
I can't tell him what to do.
Yes, you can.

02:02:48.928 --> 02:02:50.696
No, I can't.
Yes, you can.

02:02:50.697 --> 02:02:52.998
Because he's doing it for you.

02:02:52.999 --> 02:02:56.201
Because he wants you to be proud of
him. And he wants to feel closer to you.

02:02:56.202 --> 02:02:57.269
You could
have them reject him.

02:02:57.270 --> 02:02:58.804
Absolutely not.
I won't do that to him.

02:02:58.805 --> 02:03:01.740
Of course you won't. You wouldn't
do anything for anybody but yourself.

02:03:02.041 --> 02:03:03.942
That is unfair.
Unfair?

02:03:03.943 --> 02:03:05.077
That is unfair.

02:03:05.078 --> 02:03:06.678
You abandon the people
when they need you the most.

02:03:06.679 --> 02:03:07.813
I don't abandon people!

02:03:07.814 --> 02:03:09.247
You abandon people!
I do not abandon people.

02:03:09.382 --> 02:03:10.449
It's true.

02:03:10.450 --> 02:03:12.451
I have stood by you for
22 years! Stood by me?

02:03:12.452 --> 02:03:13.518
I have stood by you.

02:03:13.519 --> 02:03:15.153
You don't know what it is
to stand by somebody.

02:03:15.154 --> 02:03:16.922
I stood by you
and I have stood by him,

02:03:16.923 --> 02:03:19.057
I have done everything
to be a good father to him.

02:03:19.058 --> 02:03:22.290
You have done no such thing!
I married you because of him!

02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:51.348
I know you don't love me,
but you love him.

02:03:52.292 --> 02:03:55.594
And no matter what, you should stand
by him and you should protect him.

02:03:55.595 --> 02:03:57.963
I don't need you to tell me
I have to protect my son.

02:03:57.964 --> 02:03:59.955
Promise me that
you'll protect him.

02:04:03.803 --> 02:04:05.464
I'll protect him.

02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:12.311
Today, in Havana,
Fidel Castro

02:04:12.312 --> 02:04:14.980
expelled high-profile
crime figures from Cuba.

02:04:14.981 --> 02:04:17.215
He's taken control
of their hotels and casinos,

02:04:17.216 --> 02:04:19.981
popular vacation destinations
for many Americans.

02:04:20.153 --> 02:04:22.254
Castro has nationalized
over $1 billion

02:04:22.255 --> 02:04:24.089
from U.S. Businesses
in the past six months,

02:04:24.090 --> 02:04:26.291
and there's no telling what the
Communist dictator might do next.

02:04:26.292 --> 02:04:27.760
I want to see a man
about a hat.

02:04:28.494 --> 02:04:31.828
He had three casinos down there
until Castro sent him home.

02:04:32.632 --> 02:04:34.725
His people know
how to be discreet.

02:04:35.668 --> 02:04:39.901
With the right encouragement, he
could help. And he's very patriotic.

02:04:40.373 --> 02:04:42.569
Jimmy. Mr. Carlson.

02:04:44.410 --> 02:04:45.901
Tina, the kids.

02:04:46.045 --> 02:04:49.504
Come on, kids. Come on, come on.
We're going to the beach. Let's go.

02:04:49.749 --> 02:04:51.183
Mom, please.

02:04:53.019 --> 02:04:55.954
Sit down. Want some water,
some coffee, whatever?

02:04:57.457 --> 02:04:59.050
Is there someplace else
we could go?

02:05:02.128 --> 02:05:05.163
All right, Daddy, we're going down to
the beach. We'll be back in a while.

02:05:05.164 --> 02:05:08.367
Make sure they don't go into the
water unless somebody's watching them.

02:05:08.368 --> 02:05:10.135
No, I'm gonna
let them drown.

02:05:10.136 --> 02:05:13.038
Make sure they put their shoes
on. They'll burn their feet!

02:05:13.039 --> 02:05:16.373
We're getting their shoes!
All right, come on. Let's go.

02:05:20.413 --> 02:05:22.280
So, what do you want to
talk to me about?

02:05:22.281 --> 02:05:25.817
The government's about to deport
you for certain activities.

02:05:25.818 --> 02:05:28.344
I've been in this country
since I'm two months old.

02:05:28.888 --> 02:05:31.915
What does that make me,
Italian? I'm American.

02:05:33.059 --> 02:05:34.893
And they're trying to
send me back?

02:05:34.894 --> 02:05:37.158
I could have the
deportation order reviewed.

02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:41.833
Have you classified as highly
sensitive for national security.

02:05:41.834 --> 02:05:44.827
I could take the government off
your back if you can help us.

02:05:45.571 --> 02:05:48.440
Youse are the guys
that scare me.

02:05:48.441 --> 02:05:50.102
You're the people
that make big wars.

02:05:50.710 --> 02:05:54.044
No, we make sure the wars
are small ones, Mr. Palmi.

02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:56.942
Let me ask you something.

02:05:57.850 --> 02:06:01.343
We Italians, we got our
families and we got the Church.

02:06:02.588 --> 02:06:06.650
The Irish, they have their
homeland. The Jews, their tradition.

02:06:08.394 --> 02:06:11.125
Even the niggers,
they got their music.

02:06:12.532 --> 02:06:15.934
What about you people,
Mr. Carlson? What do you have?

02:06:17.737 --> 02:06:21.730
The United States of America.
The rest of you are just visiting.

02:06:29.315 --> 02:06:32.114
The President wants the noise
level on the operation turned down.

02:06:35.888 --> 02:06:37.481
How many men are involved?

02:06:39.025 --> 02:06:40.686
Fifteen hundred.

02:06:42.829 --> 02:06:45.464
Tell him we're going instead
to Bahía de Cochinos.

02:06:45.465 --> 02:06:47.490
The noise level
will be way down.

02:06:56.876 --> 02:06:58.537
We'll see you inside.

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:20.699
Could you hear
what we were talking about?

02:07:20.700 --> 02:07:22.827
No, I didn't hear anything.

02:07:24.904 --> 02:07:28.602
If something was heard,
it has to stay in this room.

02:07:29.575 --> 02:07:31.566
Oh, I know that, Father.

02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:36.078
Yeah, all right.

02:07:53.533 --> 02:07:54.864
Bonesmen!

02:07:55.868 --> 02:07:57.199
All here!

02:08:00.306 --> 02:08:03.037
Reverend Christiansen
will offer grace.

02:08:04.477 --> 02:08:07.045
Agency first, God second.

02:08:07.046 --> 02:08:09.447
Thank you, Lord,
for bringing us safely here

02:08:09.448 --> 02:08:12.043
to be with our brothers
and loved ones again.

02:08:12.852 --> 02:08:16.788
Our prayers are with our
brothers whom God has seen fit

02:08:16.789 --> 02:08:19.457
to take into
his gentle arms this year.

02:08:19.458 --> 02:08:24.963
The Honorable Senator John Russell,
Senior. Mr. Stephen Loomis...

02:08:57.863 --> 02:08:59.627
Would you like to dance,
Clover?

02:09:02.234 --> 02:09:04.897
I haven't been Clover
for a long time.

02:09:38.904 --> 02:09:41.237
I'm going to Phoenix
to live with my mother.

02:09:51.083 --> 02:09:52.851
Based on the ringing
of the church bells,

02:09:52.852 --> 02:09:54.619
we're going to assume
the recording was made

02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:56.611
at the same time
the photograph was taken.

02:09:56.856 --> 02:09:59.290
We've checked the schedules for
flights leaving major airports

02:09:59.291 --> 02:10:02.591
at or around 10:00 at night
for a two-week period.

02:10:02.862 --> 02:10:05.530
There were flights
leaving nine cities.

02:10:05.531 --> 02:10:09.868
Six were places that also would
potentially have a fan made in Belgium.

02:10:09.869 --> 02:10:14.205
Five of those places were also either
tropical or in their summer seasons.

02:10:14.206 --> 02:10:17.438
Three of those were places
where French is spoken.

02:10:18.010 --> 02:10:21.344
We think the tape was made
in either Dakar, Abidjan,

02:10:21.547 --> 02:10:23.538
or Congo-Leo.

02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:19.549
It is all gone.

02:13:25.331 --> 02:13:26.821
Hello, Mother.

02:13:28.734 --> 02:13:29.826
Let me show you.

02:13:36.675 --> 02:13:39.804
As you see, no cameras,
no tape recorders.

02:13:42.948 --> 02:13:45.212
There is nothing else to know.

02:13:49.054 --> 02:13:50.954
Can I play something for you?

02:13:56.795 --> 02:13:58.730
Everything is a secret.

02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:03.434
You were brought up
on secrets.

02:14:03.435 --> 02:14:06.837
What was such a big secret
that his own son couldn't know?

02:14:09.174 --> 02:14:11.541
When he was
standing outside talking,

02:14:12.811 --> 02:14:14.612
I'd heard something
I wasn't supposed to,

02:14:14.613 --> 02:14:17.583
and he knew I'd listened
to his conversation.

02:14:18.717 --> 02:14:21.050
I heard them
say something in Spanish.

02:14:22.788 --> 02:14:24.119
Bahía de Cochinos.

02:14:24.957 --> 02:14:26.823
Bahía de Cochinos.

02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:29.821
I'm afraid of him.

02:14:31.897 --> 02:14:33.957
You are safe
here with me.

02:14:35.467 --> 02:14:38.494
People who really love each
other don't have secrets.

02:14:40.506 --> 02:14:42.269
I have something to tell you.

02:14:51.617 --> 02:14:53.608
I love you so much.

02:14:54.787 --> 02:14:56.550
I love you so much.

02:15:03.796 --> 02:15:07.289
She's been an active asset
of ours for some time.

02:15:10.970 --> 02:15:12.301
Until now.

02:15:14.139 --> 02:15:15.573
She loves your son.

02:15:20.512 --> 02:15:23.141
Sometimes
even spies fall in love.

02:15:26.986 --> 02:15:28.749
We can protect him.

02:15:29.221 --> 02:15:30.746
Make him safe.

02:15:31.156 --> 02:15:33.523
Nobody would know,
not even him.

02:15:37.096 --> 02:15:39.656
All it would require
is for you

02:15:41.734 --> 02:15:43.099
to help us

02:15:44.436 --> 02:15:46.427
when your help is needed.

02:16:01.286 --> 02:16:03.118
I thought
you'd like to see this.

02:16:07.626 --> 02:16:09.651
She's a very pretty girl.

02:16:10.796 --> 02:16:13.424
It's easy to see
why he fell for her.

02:16:29.448 --> 02:16:32.884
I know it's an extremely
difficult situation for you.

02:16:37.222 --> 02:16:40.316
But I'm afraid I'm going to
need your answer very soon.

02:16:43.195 --> 02:16:44.754
You must decide

02:16:46.498 --> 02:16:48.967
what is of more importance
to you.

02:16:50.769 --> 02:16:52.430
Your country or...

02:16:56.941 --> 02:16:58.376
Or your son.

02:17:28.707 --> 02:17:30.539
She's not
who you think she is.

02:17:32.745 --> 02:17:34.975
She's not a friendly, Edward.

02:17:35.614 --> 02:17:37.412
I don't believe you.

02:17:37.883 --> 02:17:40.147
Why should I believe you?

02:17:40.486 --> 02:17:43.352
You told me yourself
not to trust anybody.

02:17:44.388 --> 02:17:47.120
You're the master
at creating the truth.

02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:50.360
I love her.

02:17:51.096 --> 02:17:52.825
I've asked her
to marry me.

02:17:53.298 --> 02:17:55.129
I will not let you
take that away from me.

02:17:55.267 --> 02:17:57.602
I can't protect you anymore,
I can't keep you safe.

02:17:57.602 --> 02:17:58.695
Safe?

02:18:01.206 --> 02:18:03.402
Safe? I never felt safe.

02:18:03.674 --> 02:18:04.941
I was always frightened.

02:18:04.942 --> 02:18:08.079
I always lived in fear that something
awful was going to happen to you.

02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:10.013
Or if not,
to Mother or to me.

02:18:10.014 --> 02:18:13.110
I was always afraid, because
everything was a secret.

02:19:32.397 --> 02:19:33.496
Edward.

02:19:33.498 --> 02:19:35.900
Hello, may I come in?
Yes. Of course.

02:19:35.901 --> 02:19:37.834
Is everything all right?

02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:40.638
I was on my way home
from work

02:19:40.638 --> 02:19:43.941
and I had this overwhelming
desire to hear you play the violin.

02:19:43.941 --> 02:19:45.568
Play the violin? But...

02:19:46.712 --> 02:19:49.681
Edward, I'm so tired. Can't
this wait until tomorrow?

02:19:49.915 --> 02:19:52.247
I'd appreciate it
if you'd play it now.

02:19:53.518 --> 02:19:54.577
Now?

02:23:08.914 --> 02:23:11.610
I just wanted to hear something
from you that was true.

02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:23.487
He was careless.

02:23:23.962 --> 02:23:26.522
FBI. You're under arrest.
Stand up.

02:23:28.467 --> 02:23:30.401
Didn't learn how to
hide in plain sight.

02:23:30.802 --> 02:23:32.670
Where are they taking me?

02:23:32.671 --> 02:23:35.572
I can't go home! You know
they can't trust me anymore!

02:23:36.074 --> 02:23:37.906
You know
what they will do to me!

02:23:38.243 --> 02:23:39.574
Sorry, Edward.

02:23:41.146 --> 02:23:43.478
I truly did like you.

02:23:44.916 --> 02:23:48.944
I mean it. In another world, we actually
would have been quite good friends.

02:23:52.290 --> 02:23:54.122
Are you still there, Mother?

02:23:54.326 --> 02:23:56.590
Your worst fear has come true.

02:24:01.099 --> 02:24:02.931
Alone and friendless

02:24:05.070 --> 02:24:07.232
without a country of your own.

02:25:19.578 --> 02:25:22.342
We have a whole new place
to fight over.

02:25:24.549 --> 02:25:25.915
The stars.

02:25:30.789 --> 02:25:32.188
Your offer.

02:25:35.827 --> 02:25:37.420
I have to decline.

02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:52.240
You've succeeded in stopping
us from taking back Cuba.

02:25:55.914 --> 02:25:57.746
The damage is done.

02:26:00.852 --> 02:26:03.185
There's no need for you
to hurt my son.

02:26:09.761 --> 02:26:12.025
Let's just leave it
between you and me.

02:26:16.434 --> 02:26:17.766
Very well.

02:26:19.738 --> 02:26:21.171
I will wait.

02:26:23.274 --> 02:26:25.334
But there will come a time

02:26:27.278 --> 02:26:30.043
when I will ask you to help me
with a problem

02:26:31.116 --> 02:26:35.052
that wouldn't cost you much
but be of some value to me.

02:26:38.690 --> 02:26:41.284
You never know
what the future will bring.

02:26:43.895 --> 02:26:47.195
Friends can be enemies,
and enemies friends.

02:27:04.082 --> 02:27:05.379
This girl,

02:27:07.719 --> 02:27:10.279
neither of us
can be sure about her.

02:27:14.092 --> 02:27:17.062
But she's about to be
a part of your family.

02:27:19.831 --> 02:27:21.629
I believe in family.

02:27:26.905 --> 02:27:29.738
You want her to be
a part of your family,

02:27:31.376 --> 02:27:32.707
don't you?

02:27:57.736 --> 02:27:59.670
It was good to see you.

02:28:02.073 --> 02:28:05.737
We will talk again,
my dear friend.

02:28:14.419 --> 02:28:15.819
Sorry to bother.

02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:18.983
I want to buy a little souvenir to
my daughter. They have no change.

02:28:20.625 --> 02:28:21.925
What does it cost?

02:28:21.926 --> 02:28:23.417
It costs a dollar.

02:28:25.396 --> 02:28:29.163
Here. It's a gift. Regards from
the United States government.

02:28:30.268 --> 02:28:33.101
It's a cardinal rule
to be generous in a democracy.

02:28:38.176 --> 02:28:39.439
Thank you.

02:29:33.364 --> 02:29:35.199
So where is she?

02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:37.000
We're gonna meet her
at the church.

02:29:37.001 --> 02:29:40.003
I can't wait to meet her. You'll
love her. You're gonna love her.

02:29:42.907 --> 02:29:44.568
Yes, that's good.

02:29:59.791 --> 02:30:01.190
Come on in.

02:30:10.401 --> 02:30:12.028
Hello, Margaret.

02:30:16.541 --> 02:30:19.306
Let's celebrate.
I'll get some champagne.

02:30:26.684 --> 02:30:28.448
How was the flight?

02:30:30.822 --> 02:30:32.255
It was long.

02:30:42.133 --> 02:30:44.466
How do you like
living in Phoenix?

02:30:48.206 --> 02:30:50.265
It's the first time
I've slept in years.

02:30:54.779 --> 02:30:56.110
Here we go.

02:31:21.839 --> 02:31:23.171
To your happiness.

02:31:23.408 --> 02:31:24.739
To your happiness.

02:33:12.250 --> 02:33:13.683
Your wife...

02:33:14.185 --> 02:33:15.949
What have you done?

02:33:17.722 --> 02:33:19.918
Will you go inside, Mother?

02:33:21.459 --> 02:33:23.120
Go inside, Mom.

02:33:24.896 --> 02:33:27.387
Please, just go in the church.

02:33:37.608 --> 02:33:39.342
She's pregnant.

02:33:57.728 --> 02:33:59.560
You couldn't...
You couldn't have.

02:34:01.032 --> 02:34:02.727
You couldn't.
No.

02:34:03.701 --> 02:34:05.362
I love you.

02:34:06.437 --> 02:34:08.201
I love you
so much.

02:34:32.764 --> 02:34:34.493
Mr. Wilson?
Mr. Hayes.

02:34:35.566 --> 02:34:38.092
Have you been here before,
Mother? No, I haven't.

02:34:39.137 --> 02:34:41.037
Whose idea was that?

02:34:41.305 --> 02:34:42.898
It's classified.

02:34:45.943 --> 02:34:48.640
Mr. Allen has notified
the President he'll resign.

02:34:50.715 --> 02:34:53.275
Something about
Swiss bank accounts.

02:34:55.153 --> 02:34:56.520
Where did these
come from?

02:34:56.521 --> 02:35:00.116
They were in the car. I thought
you had them sent down, sir.

02:35:00.324 --> 02:35:04.193
Seems the greedy bastard has
been hiding money away for years.

02:35:04.595 --> 02:35:08.623
Whoever had the statements sent them
to him in a box of Swiss chocolates.

02:35:11.402 --> 02:35:13.302
It wasn't you, was it?

02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:18.175
The President's asked me
to become Director

02:35:18.176 --> 02:35:20.777
and do a complete
housecleaning at my discretion.

02:35:20.778 --> 02:35:22.269
I need someone I can trust.

02:35:22.713 --> 02:35:25.080
After all,
we're still brothers.

02:35:27.084 --> 02:35:29.485
This building
doesn't get built without you.

02:35:29.854 --> 02:35:32.016
You're CIA's heart and soul.

02:35:32.857 --> 02:35:36.885
Who knows, you might have a secret
about me in that safe of yours.

02:35:38.763 --> 02:35:43.530
This whole wing will be your part
of the world. Counterintelligence.

02:35:44.302 --> 02:35:47.037
Take a look around.
I've got an oversight meeting.

02:35:47.038 --> 02:35:50.701
Can you imagine? They think
they can look into our closet.

02:35:51.142 --> 02:35:52.803
As if we'll let them.

02:35:56.314 --> 02:35:58.783
I remember
a senator once asked me

02:35:59.450 --> 02:36:03.444
when we talk about CIA, why we never
use the word "the" in front of it.

02:36:04.388 --> 02:36:07.984
And I asked him, "Do you put
the word 'the' in front of God?"

02:36:57.208 --> 02:36:59.472
"They are right
what they say about me.

02:37:00.511 --> 02:37:03.481
"I was weak. A coward.

02:37:07.051 --> 02:37:08.951
"I compromised myself.

02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:12.883
"My honor. My family.
My country.

02:37:16.294 --> 02:37:18.285
"I am ashamed of myself.

02:37:20.197 --> 02:37:23.531
"To my wife, I am sorry
I've done this to you.

02:37:26.137 --> 02:37:27.627
"To my son,

02:37:28.306 --> 02:37:31.241
"I hope you will grow to be
a courageous man.

02:37:32.076 --> 02:37:34.977
"A good husband.
A good father.

02:37:41.719 --> 02:37:45.587
"I hope whatever you decide to
do, you lead a good, full life.

02:37:51.195 --> 02:37:54.631
"I hope whatever
your dreams may be come true.

02:37:58.202 --> 02:38:00.603
"Your loving husband
and father. "
