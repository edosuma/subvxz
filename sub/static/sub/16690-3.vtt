00:02.169 --> 00:04.004
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares...

00:04.037 --> 00:06.707
Chef Ramsay heads
to a New York eatery

00:06.740 --> 00:09.276
that is all sizzle
and no steak.

00:09.309 --> 00:10.410
Disgusting.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.912
The kitchen is run by a chef

00:11.945 --> 00:13.714
who is bursting
with confidence.

00:13.747 --> 00:14.748
I'm a natural.

00:14.781 --> 00:15.816
People love my food.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.150
They rave about me.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.919
But doesn't exactly deliver

00:18.952 --> 00:21.121
on the plate.
It's freezing cold.

00:21.154 --> 00:23.390
The owner is a bystander

00:23.423 --> 00:25.592
who spends most of his time
at the bar.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.228
Joe'll sit
and drink glasses of wine

00:28.262 --> 00:30.000
when there is a million things
going wrong here.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.564
when there is a million things
going wrong here.

00:30.597 --> 00:33.634
And his wife, well,
she is facing

00:33.667 --> 00:35.769
the most difficult decision
of her life.

00:35.802 --> 00:37.871
I just don't know what to do.

00:37.905 --> 00:40.574
Continue to keep the doors open

00:40.607 --> 00:42.142
and lose what little
this family has left.

00:42.175 --> 00:43.844
We got rid of everything
to stay here.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.379
Or close the restaurant.

00:46.947 --> 00:49.283
Can Chef Ramsay breathe new life
into a restaurant

00:49.316 --> 00:50.884
that is in critical condition?

00:50.918 --> 00:52.185
You have
the  responsibility

00:52.219 --> 00:53.687
of making this place work.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.355
Or will he be forced to put
a fork in it?

00:55.389 --> 00:57.224
Where the
do you start with that?

00:57.257 --> 00:58.258
And move on?

00:58.292 --> 01:00.000
Stop.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.127
Stop.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.428
Stop the madness.

01:01.461 --> 01:03.497
This business cannot go
any further forward.

01:03.530 --> 01:05.933
That's tonight
on Kitchen Nightmares.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.769
Nothing's gonna work.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.756
Forest Hills.

01:29.790 --> 01:30.000
An upper middle-class enclave
in the heart

01:30.000 --> 01:31.458
An upper middle-class enclave
in the heart

01:31.491 --> 01:32.793
of Queens, New York

01:32.826 --> 01:34.962
where more than 70,000 people
live

01:34.995 --> 01:36.663
within two square miles.

01:36.697 --> 01:37.898
The neighborhood streets
are busy,

01:37.931 --> 01:42.202
but PJ's restaurant
is empty.

01:42.235 --> 01:43.203
Kiss me.
Kiss me.

01:43.236 --> 01:44.704
Prior to opening the restaurant,

01:44.738 --> 01:48.208
Joe and Madalyn
were living a dream life.

01:48.241 --> 01:49.776
When I first came
to the States,

01:49.810 --> 01:51.611
I started working
in construction.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.346
Worked with my brother PJ.

01:53.380 --> 01:56.616
PJ and I
were very, very close.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.219
He really and truly taught me
about life

01:59.252 --> 02:00.000
and be my own man.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.188
and be my own man.

02:01.221 --> 02:03.356
Busted my hump for 20 years,

02:03.390 --> 02:05.492
worked as hard as I could
to get my wife and kids

02:05.525 --> 02:07.594
nice things,
a nice house.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.930
We were going places.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.065
And then PJ passed away.

02:14.334 --> 02:16.169
Joe was a shell.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.872
Joe was just empty.

02:18.905 --> 02:21.374
I can't mention his name
without feeling

02:21.408 --> 02:23.877
that hurt inside,
you know?

02:23.910 --> 02:24.911
He didn't really know
how to walk

02:24.945 --> 02:29.816
without that guy being around.

02:29.850 --> 02:30.000
He just meant everything
to him.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.853
He just meant everything
to him.

02:32.886 --> 02:36.523
I just couldn't stand
to see him in pain.

02:36.556 --> 02:39.125
And when this place came
for rent,

02:39.159 --> 02:40.660
I said, "Go and get the key,

02:40.694 --> 02:42.963
and we'll just name it
after PJ."

02:42.996 --> 02:44.364
Welcome to PJ's.

02:44.397 --> 02:46.399
Which is even more special

02:46.433 --> 02:48.969
because this was the bar
that PJ owned.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.637
How are you guys doing?

02:50.670 --> 02:53.240
You know what I know about
running a high-end steakhouse?

02:53.273 --> 02:54.808
Apparently not much.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.843
I don't know why we're putting
garlic on honey mustard.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.379
Joe, it's a honey mustard,
garlic-roasted salmon.

02:59.412 --> 03:00.000
That's what it's supposed
to be on the menu.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.380
That's what it's supposed
to be on the menu.

03:00.413 --> 03:01.882
Really?

03:01.915 --> 03:03.483
Joe and Madalyn, they're from
a construction background.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.218
And so they didn't really know
what it was like

03:05.252 --> 03:06.419
to get
into the restaurant industry.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.321
My steak just was flavorless.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.823
Red meat is red meat.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.258
I don't know
what you would expect

03:11.291 --> 03:12.726
myself to do about that.

03:12.759 --> 03:15.095
It's a big problem,

03:15.128 --> 03:17.264
and the food's inconsistent.

03:17.297 --> 03:19.733
I'm a very good chef.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.468
People come here
just for me.

03:21.501 --> 03:22.569
How is everything?

03:22.602 --> 03:23.570
It's terrible. I'm sorry.

03:23.603 --> 03:24.871
They love my food,

03:24.905 --> 03:26.006
and everything is great.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.741
It was raw.
I can't eat that.

03:27.774 --> 03:28.942
They didn't like
the steak.

03:28.975 --> 03:30.000
Now I have to void
two checks.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.710
Now I have to void
two checks.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.345
I want this place
to work so bad.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.281
But we don't know
what we're doing wrong.

03:34.314 --> 03:36.249
Give me a cigarette
right now.

03:36.283 --> 03:37.817
Give me a cigarette.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.853
I sunk almost $2 million
in this restaurant.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.289
I see it
dying in its shoes right now.

03:42.322 --> 03:44.724
Two insurances
have to get paid this week.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.126
This restaurant, it's cost us

03:46.159 --> 03:48.028
our savings, our house,
our cars.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.029
Everything.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.997
$4,000.
That was so much money.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.299
That's it.
I'm going drinking.

03:52.332 --> 03:53.533
Meh.
Going drinking?

03:53.567 --> 03:54.668
You've been doing that
all day.

03:54.701 --> 03:57.771
Joe'll sit
and drink glasses of wine

03:57.804 --> 04:00.000
and watch television when there
is a million things

04:00.000 --> 04:00.340
and watch television when there
is a million things

04:00.373 --> 04:02.509
going wrong here.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.311
And he's just basically
feeling sorry.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.580
If the problems
aren't addressed,

04:06.613 --> 04:07.747
we'll have no choice.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.316
We'll have to close
the door.

04:20.026 --> 04:22.529
There must be trouble
on the inside.

04:22.562 --> 04:24.297
Wow, the place
is beautiful.

04:24.331 --> 04:25.332
Unbelievable.

04:25.365 --> 04:26.700
Wow.

04:26.733 --> 04:29.069
Anybody here?

04:29.102 --> 04:30.000
My goodness, me.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.637
My goodness, me.

04:30.670 --> 04:31.771
No one at the front desk.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.582
Hello?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.217
Sir, are you a customer
or--

04:44.250 --> 04:46.086
Mr. Ramsay, no.
I'm the owner.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.288
You're the owner.
Huh. Right.

04:48.321 --> 04:49.356
How are you?

04:49.389 --> 04:50.957
Very well. How are you?
Pleasure to see you.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.492
Um, good to see you too.

04:52.525 --> 04:53.960
Didn't expect to see you
at the bar.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.161
You've got no one
at the front desk there.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.630
That's today, yeah.

04:56.663 --> 04:59.165
As soon as Chef Ramsay
showed up, panic set in,

04:59.199 --> 05:00.000
and I started getting
the butterflies.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.533
and I started getting
the butterflies.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.335
We're pretty slow this time
of day, so...

05:02.369 --> 05:03.336
Slow.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.671
Is that normal?

05:04.704 --> 05:05.672
It is normal
for lunch, yeah.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.674
Right.
Hello.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.009
This is my wife Madalyn.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.010
Hi. How are you?
Right. How are you?

05:10.043 --> 05:11.144
Good.
Nice to see you.

05:11.177 --> 05:12.612
You too.
Eric.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.847
Eric. Good to see you.
Good to see you.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.515
I'm not intimidated
by Gordon.

05:15.548 --> 05:16.783
We're here to get a job done,

05:16.816 --> 05:18.551
and we better do the job
the best we can.

05:18.585 --> 05:19.986
And if he can help us,
great.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.256
If he can't,
then he can go  himself.

05:23.289 --> 05:24.491
Well, first of all,
I'm happy to be here.

05:24.524 --> 05:27.627
I'm somewhat taken aback
by walking in

05:27.661 --> 05:29.896
and happening to see
how beautiful this place is.

05:29.929 --> 05:30.000
What's wrong with it?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.097
What's wrong with it?

05:31.131 --> 05:34.567
I'm not restaurant material,

05:34.601 --> 05:35.769
I found out.
Uh-huh.

05:35.802 --> 05:37.871
I'm a contractor
who jumped into this,

05:37.904 --> 05:40.073
who thought I'd get
great managers,

05:40.106 --> 05:41.908
good floor people,
I'd sit back

05:41.941 --> 05:43.076
and have a couple of wines
at the bar.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.511
I wish opening restaurants
were that easy.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.146
Yeah, right.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.514
Yeah, I'm learning
as I go.

05:47.547 --> 05:50.517
It can put you in a hole
real fast, a restaurant.

05:50.550 --> 05:51.551
I don't know where to go.

05:51.584 --> 05:53.653
Okay, well,
I've just arrived.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.821
Yeah?
I'm starving.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.357
I'm gonna have some lunch.

05:57.390 --> 05:58.525
And then we'll talk after,
yeah?

05:58.558 --> 06:00.000
Yeah, I want to cook him
a great meal.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.161
Yeah, I want to cook him
a great meal.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.997
And I'm gonna let him find out
the problems in the restaurant

06:04.030 --> 06:06.132
besides mine, 'cause I don't
think mine's a problem.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.434
Oh, dear.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.069
Thank you.
Okay. You're welcome.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.470
So steakhouse.

06:10.503 --> 06:12.572
Oh, dear.

06:12.605 --> 06:14.140
No porterhouse.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.508
No New York.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.978
No rump.
There's only two cuts of steak.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.614
Two steaks on the menu
in a steakhouse?

06:21.648 --> 06:24.017
It should be
minimum eight to ten.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.385
How are you?
Welcome to PJ's.

06:25.418 --> 06:26.386
My name's Colin.
Very well, thank you.

06:26.419 --> 06:27.487
How are you?
Doing great.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.922
Thank you for joining us.
Good to see you.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.000
So I'll start
with crab cakes.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.990
So I'll start
with crab cakes.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.493
Then maybe the shrimp
and roasted garlic ravioli.

06:33.526 --> 06:35.628
And then I'll have
the filet mignon

06:35.662 --> 06:37.197
with the Gorgonzola demi-glace.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.099
All right,
I'll go put this in for you.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.533
Thank you, Colin.
No problem.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.569
I know Eric's a good chef.

06:42.602 --> 06:45.038
So what's to be nervous about?

06:45.071 --> 06:46.139
What'd he order?

06:46.172 --> 06:47.674
Crab cakes plus filet mignon

06:47.707 --> 06:49.609
with Gorgonzola medium rare
and a shrimp ravioli.

06:49.642 --> 06:50.744
Write it down.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.078
I just love
what I do.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.346
This is perfect.

06:53.379 --> 06:54.748
My food is good,
and if he critiques it

06:54.781 --> 06:56.683
like I seen him critique
other people's food,

06:56.716 --> 06:57.917
I'm gonna probably throw it
at him.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.000
What is that?

07:00.000 --> 07:00.353
What is that?

07:00.386 --> 07:01.387
The crab cake.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.022
Somebody spit on my plate?

07:03.056 --> 07:04.424
What is that on there?
That's coulis mango sauce.

07:04.457 --> 07:05.458
Oh, coulis mango.

07:05.492 --> 07:06.793
Thank you.

07:06.826 --> 07:08.461
It's like something
out of a modern art museum.

07:08.495 --> 07:10.296
Splat.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.331
Okay.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.969
Wow.
That's  disgusting.

07:17.036 --> 07:18.905
It's rancid.

07:20.673 --> 07:24.144
Plastic bits of crap
running through the crab cakes.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.411
Is everything okay?

07:25.445 --> 07:26.880
Yeah, the chef sent out
a little surprise.

07:26.913 --> 07:28.448
Bits of plastic
running through there.

07:28.481 --> 07:29.582
See the plastic?

07:29.616 --> 07:30.000
I don't know
where it came from,

07:30.000 --> 07:30.583
I don't know
where it came from,

07:30.617 --> 07:31.751
but it's definitely
in there.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.052
I'm done with that.
Thanks.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.788
Okay.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.856
Severe warning

07:36.890 --> 07:38.391
of what's to come.

07:38.424 --> 07:39.392
Eric.

07:39.425 --> 07:41.861
He found a piece
of plastic in there.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.597
Where's that from?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.767
him.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.904
I have no idea
where that plastic came from.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.572
It just happened
to appear.

07:52.605 --> 07:55.308
I don't even have plastic
in my kitchen.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.000
The owner sat at the bar
watching television.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.815
The owner sat at the bar
watching television.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.750
And they're wondering
why they're not doing well.

08:04.818 --> 08:05.885
Hi.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.420
Is that Joe's seat there
at the end?

08:07.453 --> 08:08.721
Yes.

08:08.755 --> 08:09.856
All the time.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.457
He'll sit there
most of the night.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.293
Oh, dear.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.296
Joe does need
to get off his ass

08:16.329 --> 08:17.864
and start paying attention.

08:19.098 --> 08:20.667
Oh, here's my food.
Fantastic.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.235
Let me leave you alone
to eat.

08:22.268 --> 08:23.236
Madalyn,
thank you.

08:23.269 --> 08:26.673
Lovely.
Thank you.

08:26.706 --> 08:29.375
Let's see.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.248
How'd you like the steak?

08:35.281 --> 08:37.283
Umm...
quite tough.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.451
Are they always served
with raw onions or--

08:38.484 --> 08:40.153
Yeah.
Nah.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.955
Thank you.
My pleasure.

08:41.988 --> 08:44.457
He said
the beef's a little tough.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.995
There's nothing positive
being said.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.197
I don't really suck
that bad, you know?

08:52.599 --> 08:54.434
Oh, dear,
that looks

08:54.467 --> 08:57.837
like the biggest pile
of

08:57.871 --> 08:59.239
ever to be served
in Queens.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.000
My God.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.341
My God.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.145
The raviolis are disgusting,

09:06.179 --> 09:10.216
tart, tannin,
and just a mouthful

09:10.250 --> 09:11.985
of acidic, thick, rich,
creamy sauce

09:12.018 --> 09:13.853
that tastes like there's a buzz
in your mouth.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.090
It just seemed like Chef Ramsay
didn't like anything.

09:17.123 --> 09:19.058
Excuse me.
Oh, God.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.194
Ooh, dear.
This is really bad.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.863
I can really start
to understand

09:23.897 --> 09:28.534
why Queens is running
as fast as it can from PJ's.

09:30.970 --> 09:32.071
Disgusted by the food

09:32.105 --> 09:33.239
in this beautiful restaurant,

09:33.273 --> 09:35.842
Chef Ramsay heads
to the problem area--

09:35.875 --> 09:36.943
the kitchen.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.544
Did you cook everything?
Yeah.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.713
That was pretty
embarrassing.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.185
100% pissed me off

09:46.219 --> 09:48.388
that Chef Ramsay didn't enjoy
my meal.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.989
What's with the coulis?

09:50.023 --> 09:51.691
It's like something out
of a modern art museum.

09:51.724 --> 09:52.792
Splat.

09:52.825 --> 09:53.793
Where's that from?

09:53.826 --> 09:55.428
From a can.
From a can.

09:55.461 --> 09:57.697
Disgusting.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.000
The steak. Filet should melt
in your mouth,

10:00.000 --> 10:00.500
The steak. Filet should melt
in your mouth,

10:00.533 --> 10:01.801
and it did nothing
of the sort.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.169
It's what we could afford.

10:04.203 --> 10:05.238
Eric, come around,

10:05.271 --> 10:06.739
so I can talk
to you properly.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.308
I was shocked.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.609
I really thought
that Eric's food

10:09.642 --> 10:14.380
was a lot better than what
Chef Ramsay said it was.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.683
The food was.
I get a lot of compliments, man.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.151
A lot.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.152
A lot of compliments
from where?

10:19.185 --> 10:21.321
The place is  empty.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.455
Who's running the place?

10:24.157 --> 10:25.358
For the most part,
I am.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.393
Oh, please.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.561
First of all,
I'm here every day.

10:28.594 --> 10:29.896
You're not here every day.

10:29.929 --> 10:30.000
I'm not here enough
to mother him.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.864
I'm not here enough
to mother him.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.666
But I am here.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.901
He should be here,

10:34.934 --> 10:36.302
but he's not doing it.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.438
If you're here
really overseeing everything,

10:38.471 --> 10:39.605
then these problems
aren't gonna be here,

10:39.639 --> 10:41.674
so get your ass
off the barstool

10:41.708 --> 10:42.942
and stand in here
and do it

10:42.976 --> 10:44.243
every single night.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.112
Can you motivate yourself

10:46.145 --> 10:47.246
to want to keep
the restaurant open?

10:47.280 --> 10:49.315
I don't know.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.318
Well, he's given up.
I see that in myself, yeah.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.886
I've given up.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.421
Guys, I'm  sorry,

10:55.455 --> 10:57.924
But take one good look
at yourselves first.

10:57.957 --> 10:59.392
If there's one thing
that has to change,

10:59.425 --> 11:00.000
it's people's attitude
around here.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.427
it's people's attitude
around here.

11:01.461 --> 11:02.595
Whether you like it or not,

11:02.628 --> 11:04.430
you are "restauranteurs."

11:04.464 --> 11:05.665
You have the
responsibility

11:05.698 --> 11:07.667
of making this place work.
Yup.

11:07.700 --> 11:08.668
And there's too many people
turning their backs

11:08.701 --> 11:10.536
on things that are wrong.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.138
I gotta get
some fresh air.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.140
What a shame.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.775
We have absolutely no idea

11:15.808 --> 11:16.976
what we're doing here.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.511
It's just a big disaster.

11:18.544 --> 11:20.046
Are we opening
for dinner?

11:20.079 --> 11:21.614
Coming up

11:21.647 --> 11:22.749
on Kitchen Nightmares...

11:22.782 --> 11:24.350
Madalyn makes a confession.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.052
I was worried.

11:26.085 --> 11:28.154
And a shocking family secret
is revealed.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.000
Oh, my God.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.423
Oh, my God.

11:30.456 --> 11:31.624
Then at dinner service,

11:31.657 --> 11:33.192
Eric's head is spinning.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.261
I'm so  lost, man.

11:35.294 --> 11:36.396
Joe is drinking at the bar.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.297
Give me a glass
of Shiraz.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.700
And Madalyn is ready
to call it quits.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.101
It's not even worth being open.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.736
It's a New York mess,

11:43.770 --> 11:45.838
and Chef Ramsay is caught
in the middle.

11:53.366 --> 11:54.667
After a miserable lunch,

11:54.700 --> 11:57.904
Gordon takes time to sit down
with the one person

11:57.937 --> 11:59.872
who appears
to have not given up--

11:59.906 --> 12:01.707
Joe's wife Madalyn.

12:01.741 --> 12:03.509
The word "PJ,"
where does that come from?

12:03.543 --> 12:05.444
Joe's brother.
Joe's brother.

12:05.478 --> 12:06.812
Joe's brother owned

12:06.846 --> 12:09.382
an Irish bar-restaurant here
ten years ago.

12:09.415 --> 12:12.485
And he died
when it was at its peak.

12:12.518 --> 12:13.953
He died.

12:13.986 --> 12:15.955
How close
were they?

12:15.988 --> 12:17.056
They were best friends.

12:17.089 --> 12:18.558
And he was very sad.

12:18.591 --> 12:19.926
He was empty.

12:19.959 --> 12:20.476
I was worried
for his welfare.

12:20.476 --> 12:21.460
I was worried
for his welfare.

12:21.494 --> 12:23.930
I was worried.

12:23.963 --> 12:25.264
And when this place
came for rent,

12:25.298 --> 12:26.265
he came home
and told me about it.

12:26.299 --> 12:27.900
So I told him,
you know,

12:27.934 --> 12:29.702
get the key, and we'll put

12:29.735 --> 12:31.537
his brother's name back
over the door,

12:31.571 --> 12:33.573
and he spent
all the money,

12:33.606 --> 12:35.508
but it helped him.

12:37.109 --> 12:39.478
It's getting
to him now, just the money.

12:39.512 --> 12:41.714
And I think
that's why he's at that bar

12:41.747 --> 12:43.149
having drinks
because he's looking around.

12:43.182 --> 12:44.817
He is embarrassed

12:44.850 --> 12:45.952
at how this turned out.

12:45.985 --> 12:47.820
How much did he spend?
$1.2 million.

12:47.853 --> 12:49.522
To build it.

12:49.555 --> 12:50.476
What does it need to take
per week to break even?

12:50.476 --> 12:51.824
What does it need to take
per week to break even?

12:51.857 --> 12:54.627
About $17,000 to $18,000.

12:54.660 --> 12:56.395
What's it currently
running at now?

12:56.429 --> 12:57.563
$4,000.

12:57.597 --> 13:01.767
$4,000?
Oh, my God.

13:01.801 --> 13:03.636
Take me back.

13:03.669 --> 13:05.204
Joe was very successful before
he opened the restaurant.

13:05.238 --> 13:06.305
Yes.

13:06.339 --> 13:08.207
Yeah, in construction?
Yes.

13:08.241 --> 13:09.809
And where were you living
at the time

13:09.842 --> 13:11.510
when it was--
When we were successful?

13:11.544 --> 13:12.812
Yeah.
I designed a house.

13:12.845 --> 13:14.380
It was incredible.

13:14.413 --> 13:15.748
So you designed
your dream house.

13:15.781 --> 13:17.183
Yes.

13:17.216 --> 13:18.251
But we sold it.

13:18.284 --> 13:19.318
You sold the house
to keep

13:19.352 --> 13:20.419
the business open?
Yes.

13:20.453 --> 13:20.476
We got rid of everything
to stay here.

13:20.476 --> 13:23.189
We got rid of everything
to stay here.

13:23.222 --> 13:26.259
But this restaurant did more
for me than my house.

13:26.292 --> 13:27.526
It brought my husband back.

13:29.729 --> 13:34.100
How do you--
how do you walk away from that?

13:34.133 --> 13:35.768
I can't.

13:35.801 --> 13:36.802
This is unbelievable.

13:36.836 --> 13:38.471
Well, that's helped me

13:38.504 --> 13:41.307
to understand
the background.

13:41.340 --> 13:46.145
As much as it has cost us
to keep this place opened,

13:46.178 --> 13:49.949
at the same time,
it gave us back Joe.

13:49.982 --> 13:50.476
And we just can't let it go.

13:50.476 --> 13:52.685
And we just can't let it go.

13:52.718 --> 13:53.986
We'll do whatever we have
to do

13:54.020 --> 13:55.621
to keep this place going.

13:58.157 --> 14:00.359
After his chat with Madalyn,

14:00.393 --> 14:01.527
Gordon has
a better understanding

14:01.560 --> 14:04.230
of what PJ means
to this family.

14:04.263 --> 14:07.300
Now he wants to learn more
about how the business operates.

14:07.333 --> 14:08.501
And there's no better way
to do that

14:08.534 --> 14:11.704
than watching a dinner service.

14:11.737 --> 14:13.005
Hi, good evening.
Welcome to PJ's.

14:13.039 --> 14:14.507
Thank you.
Can I take your coat?

14:14.540 --> 14:17.043
Oh, actually,
I'm real comfortable.

14:17.076 --> 14:19.078
You have to leave it here.

14:19.111 --> 14:20.279
Okay, Colin,
take these two.

14:20.313 --> 14:20.476
As is the case with many

14:20.476 --> 14:23.349
As is the case with many

14:23.382 --> 14:24.884
Of the restaurants
that Chef Ramsay visits,

14:24.917 --> 14:26.585
the word has spread
in the community.

14:26.619 --> 14:29.855
And PJ's is much busier
than normal.

14:32.291 --> 14:34.560
I'm not used
to being the hostess.

14:34.593 --> 14:37.063
How would you like that cooked?
Well done?

14:38.264 --> 14:40.566
Ordering a salmon, well.

14:40.599 --> 14:42.501
I just know what's good,
and I know what's bad.

14:42.535 --> 14:44.103
And I know
I can handle the job.

14:44.136 --> 14:45.471
I know I can do the job
really well.

14:45.504 --> 14:46.572
'Cause my food is good.

14:46.605 --> 14:48.407
How are the stuffed mushrooms
coming?

14:50.943 --> 14:52.345
Talk to me
for two seconds.

14:54.780 --> 14:56.716
He literally doesn't talk
behind the line.

14:56.749 --> 14:58.284
He doesn't communicate
with me.

14:58.317 --> 14:59.885
Especially when it's busy.

14:59.919 --> 15:01.654
The worst situation
in the  world.

15:01.687 --> 15:02.822
Eric.
Yes, sir.

15:02.855 --> 15:03.989
You got to talk to them.
Come on.

15:04.023 --> 15:05.257
At least talk.

15:05.291 --> 15:06.292
What table is this?

15:11.297 --> 15:12.932
Eric's lack of communication

15:12.965 --> 15:15.201
has the staff
waiting for direction

15:15.234 --> 15:16.936
and the diners
waiting for food.

15:21.173 --> 15:24.043
Customers normally wait
this long for entrees?

15:24.076 --> 15:25.378
Yes.
Yeah?

15:25.411 --> 15:27.046
It usually takes
two hours to eat here.

15:27.079 --> 15:29.582
Two hours?
Two hours
from start to finish.

15:32.518 --> 15:34.186
Eric,

15:34.220 --> 15:35.388
they're starting
to complain now

15:35.421 --> 15:36.589
that there's no food
out there.

15:36.622 --> 15:37.857
Come on, you can do better
than this,

15:37.890 --> 15:38.858
can't you?

15:38.891 --> 15:39.859
Do you give a?

15:39.892 --> 15:40.860
Yeah, I give a.

15:40.893 --> 15:41.961
Come on then, big man.

15:41.994 --> 15:43.062
This is a steakhouse,
yes?

15:43.095 --> 15:44.430
PJ's Steakhouse?
PJ's Steakhouse.

15:44.463 --> 15:46.298
Yeah, pathetic joke.

15:46.332 --> 15:48.701
That's what it stands for.

15:48.734 --> 15:50.169
Come on, guys.

15:50.202 --> 15:50.476
Nobody looks too happy here.

15:50.476 --> 15:54.473
Nobody looks too happy here.

15:54.507 --> 15:55.474
You didn't get
your dinner yet?

15:55.508 --> 15:57.009
Okay.

15:58.944 --> 16:01.080
For the amount of people
we had tonight,

16:01.113 --> 16:02.081
it was a ridiculous amount
of time

16:02.114 --> 16:03.115
they had to wait
for their food.

16:06.519 --> 16:08.154
Eric, how long
on that 16?

16:08.187 --> 16:09.388
Putting it up right now.

16:09.422 --> 16:11.290
An hour into dinner service,

16:11.323 --> 16:14.126
food is finally leaving
the kitchen.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.728
Because of the amount
of customers,

16:15.761 --> 16:17.296
everyone is delivering
the food.

16:17.329 --> 16:19.999
Even Madalyn.
Gorgonzola?

16:20.032 --> 16:20.476
Who's clearly not comfortable
with the job.

16:20.476 --> 16:22.268
Who's clearly not comfortable
with the job.

16:22.301 --> 16:23.702
All right.

16:23.736 --> 16:25.070
You had the spinach,
I had the...

16:25.104 --> 16:26.539
Listen.
I had the spinach.

16:26.572 --> 16:28.240
Let's go over this,
okay?

16:28.274 --> 16:29.975
Not a waitress,
not a hostess.

16:30.009 --> 16:31.377
I only own it.

16:31.410 --> 16:33.379
So I know nothing
about the food.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.582
I am probably the only person

16:36.615 --> 16:37.850
who owns a restaurant
in the world

16:37.883 --> 16:40.219
who wouldn't know
what good food is.

16:40.252 --> 16:41.487
That's the truth.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.823
I left that part
up to Joe from the beginning.

16:43.856 --> 16:45.925
Give me a glass
of Shiraz.

16:47.126 --> 16:48.794
It's an hour and a half

16:48.828 --> 16:49.929
into dinner service.

16:49.962 --> 16:50.476
Table 30,
all the apps are in the window.

16:50.476 --> 16:51.664
Table 30,
all the apps are in the window.

16:51.697 --> 16:52.932
Many customers

16:52.965 --> 16:53.999
have received food.

16:54.033 --> 16:55.267
This is, like,
really weird.

16:55.301 --> 16:56.902
But for most,

16:56.936 --> 16:58.170
It wasn't worth the wait.

16:58.204 --> 17:00.105
That's really gross.
You don't like it?

17:00.139 --> 17:01.407
It tastes like lemonade.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.741
Lemonade?
Yeah, yeah.

17:02.775 --> 17:04.076
Wow.
Okay.

17:04.109 --> 17:06.745
So I'll tell the chef
about the chicken.

17:08.547 --> 17:10.683
Why?

17:12.084 --> 17:14.453
And what do you want me
to do with it?

17:15.621 --> 17:17.223
I'll have a word
with them.

17:17.256 --> 17:19.258
I went
to check the menu.

17:19.291 --> 17:20.476
It's chicken madeira.

17:20.476 --> 17:21.360
It's chicken madeira.

17:21.393 --> 17:22.928
And I will have them
take it off for you.

17:22.962 --> 17:24.897
Well,
you didn't even recognize it?

17:26.599 --> 17:29.535
Okay.
Thank you.

17:29.568 --> 17:30.836
Thank you.

17:32.905 --> 17:35.908
I just don't know how to have
better manners at the table.

17:36.942 --> 17:38.177
How long on 23?

17:38.210 --> 17:39.678
- Salmon and the filet.
- That salmon's.

17:39.712 --> 17:40.746
Come on, guys.

17:40.779 --> 17:42.147
Eric, touch the top
of that salmon.

17:42.181 --> 17:43.949
It's like a bullet.
Yeah, it's too overdone.

17:43.983 --> 17:45.718
It's only gonna come back.

17:45.751 --> 17:47.720
Chef Ramsay is standing there

17:47.753 --> 17:50.055
And catching the mistakes
as they're happening.

17:50.089 --> 17:50.476
Look at the crap
underneath there.

17:50.476 --> 17:51.790
Look at the crap
underneath there.

17:51.824 --> 17:53.025
Look at that.

17:53.058 --> 17:54.560
Eric, that's well-done.

17:54.593 --> 17:56.595
Everything just feels like
it's turning downward.

17:56.629 --> 17:58.364
What's that there?

17:58.397 --> 17:59.832
Yeah, that's not medium.

17:59.865 --> 18:01.200
It's a disaster.

18:01.233 --> 18:03.168
It was horrible to watch it
just fall apart.

18:03.202 --> 18:04.169
Come on.

18:04.203 --> 18:05.604
No, I can't.

18:05.638 --> 18:08.374
- It's too much for me.
- hell.

18:17.483 --> 18:18.984
Full of unhappy customers...

18:19.018 --> 18:20.586
The chicken is chewy.

18:20.620 --> 18:22.554
And a kitchen falling apart...

18:22.588 --> 18:24.523
Look at that.
Eric that's well-done.

18:25.758 --> 18:26.725
Chef Ramsay has seen

18:26.759 --> 18:28.160
enough of the dinner service

18:28.193 --> 18:29.728
and heads
to the storage area

18:29.762 --> 18:32.398
to see what problems lie below.

18:32.431 --> 18:35.034
What is that in there?

18:35.067 --> 18:37.136
Stuck to the cardboard box.

18:37.169 --> 18:39.204
No one gives a  about.
Look.

18:43.308 --> 18:45.210
Oh, my God.

18:45.244 --> 18:46.278
Look at that.

18:47.713 --> 18:49.048
Ugh,.

18:49.081 --> 18:53.285
What is that?

18:53.318 --> 18:57.022
Blech.

18:57.056 --> 18:58.757
That just sums up
the whole restaurant.

18:58.791 --> 19:01.260
Fading away.
Rotten.

19:01.293 --> 19:04.797
And just one big
embarrassment.

19:04.830 --> 19:07.366
Blech.

19:07.399 --> 19:10.702
Embarrassing.

19:10.736 --> 19:12.425
Chef Ramsay knows
that tonight's dinner service

19:12.425 --> 19:12.971
Chef Ramsay knows
that tonight's dinner service

19:13.005 --> 19:14.807
was not lost
on Joe and Madalyn.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.241
Thank you.

19:16.275 --> 19:17.976
But he wants to make sure
they have

19:18.010 --> 19:19.378
a complete picture
of the state

19:19.411 --> 19:20.746
of the restaurant.

19:20.779 --> 19:21.914
Ay-yi-yi.

19:21.947 --> 19:23.282
This is so hard.

19:23.315 --> 19:24.917
You know that.

19:24.950 --> 19:27.186
I've just come to the conclusion
that no one gives a.

19:29.788 --> 19:31.990
Stay there.

19:32.024 --> 19:33.158
When Chef Ramsay
walked in that box,

19:33.192 --> 19:34.426
I was terrified.

19:34.460 --> 19:36.195
This is the big kick
in the bollocks.

19:40.265 --> 19:42.425
I'm not here
for this.

19:42.425 --> 19:42.768
I'm not here
for this.

19:43.869 --> 19:46.839
We're using horrible
plastic lemon juice

19:46.872 --> 19:48.340
in a sauce
that a customer complained about

19:48.373 --> 19:49.775
the fact that it tasted
of lemon.

19:49.808 --> 19:51.343
We've got fresh lemons
downstairs

19:51.376 --> 19:53.078
that have gone rotten.

19:53.112 --> 19:54.580
I just can't believe it.

19:54.613 --> 19:58.550
If it was me,
I'd be down with a toothbrush.

19:58.584 --> 19:59.852
Here's the killer blow for me.

19:59.885 --> 20:01.487
Just that one there.

20:03.922 --> 20:05.491
Dealing with the restaurant
and the food

20:05.524 --> 20:07.426
and the customer's
one thing.

20:07.459 --> 20:09.628
But where the
do you start with that?

20:10.863 --> 20:12.425
It was beyond bad.

20:12.425 --> 20:13.832
It was beyond bad.

20:13.866 --> 20:15.968
It's such a lack of pride.

20:16.001 --> 20:18.270
It's such a lack
of caring.

20:18.303 --> 20:20.272
Who knows
what the  goes on

20:20.305 --> 20:22.674
behind our back?
I don't know.

20:24.610 --> 20:26.812
It is your job

20:26.845 --> 20:28.680
to go in that walk-in box

20:28.714 --> 20:30.282
and rotate your stock
and clean it out.

20:30.315 --> 20:32.217
And it's part of our job

20:32.251 --> 20:33.252
to make sure
he does it.

20:33.285 --> 20:34.653
Why should I have

20:34.686 --> 20:37.222
to  worry
about this?

20:37.256 --> 20:39.491
'Cause it's your business.

20:40.759 --> 20:42.425
You can't stand there
and be silent

20:42.425 --> 20:42.594
You can't stand there
and be silent

20:42.628 --> 20:43.795
anymore, Eric.

20:43.829 --> 20:45.297
You can't do that.

20:45.330 --> 20:47.533
It seems
like the whole blame

20:47.566 --> 20:48.967
of this whole place
is coming down on my shoulders.

20:49.001 --> 20:51.003
And it's not all my fault.

20:51.036 --> 20:53.805
I'm not the  problem
here.

20:53.839 --> 20:56.074
Quit slopping it out,
guys.

20:56.108 --> 20:57.409
Just get a bag

20:57.442 --> 20:58.977
and throw it out.

21:04.850 --> 21:07.085
I can't believe that ,
can you?

21:07.119 --> 21:09.254
How in the name of God?

21:09.287 --> 21:10.956
Imagine the wasted food.

21:10.989 --> 21:12.391
We're worse to blame,
dear.

21:12.424 --> 21:12.425
And I had no idea
what was in there.

21:12.425 --> 21:14.192
And I had no idea
what was in there.

21:14.226 --> 21:17.028
I'm very disappointed
with Eric.

21:17.062 --> 21:18.930
I realized tonight
that a lot

21:18.964 --> 21:20.399
of the problems in the kitchen
is Eric.

21:20.432 --> 21:22.734
Definitely a change
has to come.

21:22.768 --> 21:24.636
The bottom line is

21:24.669 --> 21:28.673
nobody around here wants
to work, nobody.

21:33.044 --> 21:35.080
Undeterred by a rough day one,

21:35.113 --> 21:37.315
Chef Ramsay hits the streets
of Forest Hills

21:37.349 --> 21:40.886
armed with a camcorder
to do some grassroots research

21:40.919 --> 21:42.425
on what people really think
of PJ's Steakhouse.

21:42.425 --> 21:44.256
on what people really think
of PJ's Steakhouse.

21:44.289 --> 21:45.257
Have you got two seconds?
Sure.

21:45.290 --> 21:46.324
PJ's, the steakhouse,

21:46.358 --> 21:47.526
have you heard of it?

21:47.559 --> 21:48.760
Have you been there?

21:48.794 --> 21:50.529
I have. It was not
a pleasant experience.

21:50.562 --> 21:51.997
When was the last visit
to PJ's?

21:52.030 --> 21:53.265
Six months ago.
I boycotted it.

21:53.298 --> 21:54.833
Have you heard of PJ's?
Yes.

21:54.866 --> 21:56.735
Describe the dinner.
Slow, cold, not too good.

21:56.768 --> 21:58.003
Wouldn't go back.

21:58.036 --> 21:59.671
This is incredible.
Thank you so much.

22:01.706 --> 22:04.376
After hearing what
the neighborhood had to say,

22:04.409 --> 22:06.511
Chef Ramsay calls the owners
and staff

22:06.545 --> 22:07.646
to a local theater.

22:07.679 --> 22:09.281
Take a seat.

22:09.314 --> 22:10.982
We're in this movie theater,

22:11.016 --> 22:12.425
And we have absolutely no idea
what we're doing there.

22:12.425 --> 22:13.018
And we have absolutely no idea
what we're doing there.

22:13.051 --> 22:15.687
This is
a serious world premiere.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.656
And the movie's entitled

22:17.689 --> 22:20.192
The Word on the Street.

22:20.225 --> 22:21.860
Oh, gosh.
Oh, no.

22:21.893 --> 22:23.562
I don't have a good feeling
about this.

22:23.595 --> 22:24.996
I'm scared to see
what's going to happen.

22:25.030 --> 22:26.798
Lights, please.

22:29.434 --> 22:30.902
Have you ever been to PJ's?

22:30.936 --> 22:32.237
PJ's, I've been there
quite often actually.

22:32.270 --> 22:33.305
When was the last visit
to PJ's?

22:33.338 --> 22:34.639
Six months ago.
I boycotted it.

22:34.673 --> 22:35.941
They never cook
their steak right.

22:35.974 --> 22:37.008
This is incredible.

22:37.042 --> 22:38.710
The same  went on
six months ago

22:38.743 --> 22:39.845
That I saw last night.

22:39.878 --> 22:41.179
How was dinner?
Atrocious.

22:41.213 --> 22:42.425
Really? That bad?

22:42.425 --> 22:43.114
Really? That bad?

22:43.148 --> 22:44.115
My son's steak
was a hockey puck.

22:44.149 --> 22:45.584
I actually recognized

22:45.617 --> 22:47.786
two of the customers
that was on that tape.

22:47.819 --> 22:49.521
And I thought, holy.

22:49.554 --> 22:52.290
I ordered salmon,
I got flounder.

22:52.324 --> 22:53.825
That's ridiculous.

22:53.859 --> 22:54.893
How many people have you told

22:54.926 --> 22:56.094
in the last six months
not to go there?

22:56.127 --> 22:57.729
There are 66 apartments
in my building.

22:57.762 --> 22:58.830
And you told them all
not to go?

22:58.864 --> 23:02.701
- Yes.
- It's total.

23:02.734 --> 23:06.404
I wanted to turn around
and smack Eric in the mouth.

23:06.438 --> 23:07.672
That's how angry I was.

23:07.706 --> 23:10.242
He's behind us
munching on popcorn

23:10.275 --> 23:11.243
with a grin on his face.

23:11.276 --> 23:12.425
What was the food like?
Awful.

23:12.425 --> 23:13.044
What was the food like?
Awful.

23:13.078 --> 23:14.246
Really?
Everything was pretty horrible.

23:14.279 --> 23:15.447
Pretty horrible?

23:15.480 --> 23:17.215
Yeah, the steak was chewy,
not too flavorful.

23:17.249 --> 23:18.583
If you had the chance
to change,

23:18.617 --> 23:20.318
what would it be?
Better food.

23:20.352 --> 23:21.620
Better food.

23:21.653 --> 23:23.088
That is from the people
in the street,

23:23.121 --> 23:24.956
and these people are gonna keep
that place open.

23:24.990 --> 23:26.658
My God.

23:27.826 --> 23:29.094
I was disgusted

23:29.127 --> 23:30.562
with the little movie thing
we just saw.

23:30.595 --> 23:32.564
I don't believe
it's all that true, you know?

23:32.597 --> 23:34.266
It's not that bad.

23:34.299 --> 23:35.534
Why do you find it funny?

23:35.567 --> 23:39.337
We sat here
in an embarrassing situation.

23:39.371 --> 23:40.739
It's definitely nothing
to laugh about, Eric.

23:40.772 --> 23:42.425
I don't know.
I don't believe all of it.

23:42.425 --> 23:42.908
I don't know.
I don't believe all of it.

23:44.876 --> 23:45.911
It infuriates me.

23:45.944 --> 23:46.912
If the food was good,

23:46.945 --> 23:49.514
they'd say it was excellent.

23:49.548 --> 23:51.182
We have got to start
turning this around.

23:53.251 --> 23:56.054
Can this restaurant survive
with Eric running the kitchen?

23:59.891 --> 24:02.861
Coming up, Chef Ramsay
gives Eric a lifeline.

24:02.894 --> 24:03.895
Last chance tonight.

24:03.929 --> 24:04.963
Cook your ass off.

24:04.996 --> 24:06.565
But it just might end up

24:06.598 --> 24:08.133
being a rope
to hang himself with.

24:08.166 --> 24:09.134
Everything's coming back.

24:09.167 --> 24:10.602
Can he handle the heat?

24:10.635 --> 24:11.770
Talk to me.

24:11.803 --> 24:12.425
What the
you want me to say?

24:12.425 --> 24:13.371
What the
you want me to say?

24:13.405 --> 24:14.673
Or will he self-destruct?

24:14.706 --> 24:16.675
- Stop it.
- Close the  door.

24:16.708 --> 24:18.577
Close the  door.

24:18.610 --> 24:21.112
It's time for you
and Chef Ramsay to find out.

24:21.146 --> 24:23.615
This business cannot go
any further forward.

24:23.648 --> 24:25.016
That's coming up

24:25.050 --> 24:26.384
on Kitchen Nightmares.

24:34.003 --> 24:35.472
Devastated but informed

24:35.505 --> 24:36.906
by what they heard
at the theater,

24:36.940 --> 24:38.808
the owners have a clear picture

24:38.842 --> 24:41.511
of how PJ's was perceived
by the town.

24:41.544 --> 24:43.346
But Chef Ramsay has more.

24:43.380 --> 24:44.381
Um, there's one big issue.

24:44.414 --> 24:46.116
Eric.

24:46.149 --> 24:48.318
There's nothing worse than
having a chef in the kitchen

24:48.351 --> 24:50.153
trying to produce
mediocre food.

24:52.689 --> 24:55.658
I'm telling you,
the engine room is ,

24:55.692 --> 24:56.926
And if that's not working,

24:56.960 --> 24:58.434
nothing's gonna work.

24:58.434 --> 24:59.095
nothing's gonna work.

24:59.129 --> 25:01.865
This business cannot go
any further forward

25:01.898 --> 25:03.299
with a liability
like that.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.734
It's just gotten
to a stage

25:04.768 --> 25:07.103
where he should have been gone
a long time ago.

25:08.405 --> 25:09.839
You realize
you're both at fault?

25:09.873 --> 25:10.907
Absolutely.

25:10.940 --> 25:12.742
Because you're accepting
and tolerating

25:12.776 --> 25:14.544
the incompetence.
Yes.

25:14.577 --> 25:16.012
And he's taken advantage
of your weakness

25:16.046 --> 25:18.114
by becoming worse

25:18.148 --> 25:20.050
at what he's paid to do.

25:20.083 --> 25:22.018
I would like to give him
a last chance tonight.

25:22.052 --> 25:23.386
I'm gonna put him
on the spot.

25:23.420 --> 25:24.621
And I'm gonna call it
as I see it.

25:24.654 --> 25:25.789
Get a grip.

25:25.822 --> 25:27.290
Cook your ass off.

25:27.323 --> 25:28.434
Or game over
for me.

25:28.434 --> 25:29.259
Or game over
for me.

25:29.292 --> 25:32.062
Yeah?
Sounds great.

25:32.095 --> 25:34.664
Tonight will be
Eric's last chance

25:34.697 --> 25:35.832
to save his job.

25:35.865 --> 25:38.368
So Chef Ramsay has made
a few menu changes

25:38.401 --> 25:40.103
to help the kitchen keep up.

25:40.136 --> 25:41.671
Okay, tonight,

25:41.704 --> 25:44.808
we have to start building
our reputation up.

25:44.841 --> 25:47.444
So we're gonna offer
a mixed grill.

25:47.477 --> 25:49.712
We got the amazing thighs
of chicken,

25:49.746 --> 25:52.248
steak beautifully done
on the broiler,

25:52.282 --> 25:54.217
a little mini slider,
tomato roasted,

25:54.250 --> 25:56.219
lamb sausage,
sauteed mushrooms,

25:56.252 --> 25:57.821
fries,
and onion rings.

25:57.854 --> 25:58.434
Introducing a mixed grill

25:58.434 --> 25:59.923
Introducing a mixed grill

25:59.956 --> 26:01.191
to say thank you
to the neighborhood

26:01.224 --> 26:03.226
and welcome back
and give us a shot--

26:03.259 --> 26:04.461
such a brilliant idea.

26:04.494 --> 26:05.929
That is our special
this evening.

26:05.962 --> 26:07.630
I know

26:07.664 --> 26:08.798
not one steakhouse
this evening

26:08.832 --> 26:10.834
anywhere in Queens
is serving

26:10.867 --> 26:12.001
a beautiful mixed grill.

26:12.035 --> 26:13.269
I love it.
You don't get that anywhere.

26:13.303 --> 26:14.671
That's great.

26:14.704 --> 26:15.939
Eric, anything on the menu
you can't do?

26:15.972 --> 26:17.540
No, I can do it all.
You can do it all?

26:17.574 --> 26:18.942
Okay, I need Eric, Madalyn,
and Joe.

26:18.975 --> 26:19.943
Two seconds, please, yes?

26:19.976 --> 26:21.077
This is what I do.

26:21.111 --> 26:22.445
Let me do what I do.

26:22.479 --> 26:24.080
Okay, Eric,

26:24.114 --> 26:26.349
one thing I need to see
is the timing.

26:26.382 --> 26:27.951
Your timing
has to be absolutely spot-on.

26:27.984 --> 26:28.434
Tonight's your night.
You have to show me that.

26:28.434 --> 26:29.185
Tonight's your night.
You have to show me that.

26:29.219 --> 26:30.487
You have to
show me.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.455
It's time for Eric

26:32.489 --> 26:33.590
to step up
to the plate tonight

26:33.623 --> 26:35.492
or there's no room
for him here.

26:35.525 --> 26:37.093
Okay, you're the owners.

26:37.127 --> 26:38.228
Who's running it tonight?

26:38.261 --> 26:39.295
I am.

26:39.329 --> 26:40.563
What are you doing tonight?

26:40.597 --> 26:41.664
Salads.

26:41.698 --> 26:42.799
Salads.
I don't want to see you

26:42.832 --> 26:44.334
anywhere near the  bar.

26:44.367 --> 26:45.869
Run it.
Run it, run it, run it.

26:45.902 --> 26:47.470
Okay?
Yeah.

26:47.504 --> 26:50.073
Let's go.

26:51.207 --> 26:52.342
Hi.
How are you?

26:52.375 --> 26:53.843
Good evening,
and welcome to PJ's.

26:53.877 --> 26:54.878
- Table for four?
- Yes.

26:54.911 --> 26:56.045
Follow me.

26:56.079 --> 26:57.113
We have our grill
for two tonight.

26:57.147 --> 26:58.248
Have fun, please.

26:58.281 --> 26:58.434
Smile a lot.
Smile.

26:58.434 --> 26:59.249
Smile a lot.
Smile.

27:00.517 --> 27:02.085
Enjoy.

27:02.118 --> 27:03.920
It's called
our PJ's mixed grill.

27:03.953 --> 27:05.288
And it has a flank steak on it.

27:05.321 --> 27:06.289
It has lamb sausage.

27:06.322 --> 27:07.423
It comes with grilled chicken.

27:07.457 --> 27:08.691
That's your flank steak
right there.

27:08.725 --> 27:10.226
Would you like to start out
with one of those?

27:10.260 --> 27:11.694
So what can I get you tonight?
Mixed grill.

27:11.728 --> 27:13.630
The mixed grill special.
Thank you.

27:13.663 --> 27:15.198
This is unbelievable.

27:15.231 --> 27:17.066
Already, there's
a renewed energy going on.

27:17.100 --> 27:19.035
And this mixed grill
has got them sort of excited.

27:19.068 --> 27:20.537
But I know it's early days.

27:20.570 --> 27:22.105
However, the big pressure
is on Eric and Madalyn.

27:22.138 --> 27:23.473
She has to run the business,

27:23.506 --> 27:25.175
and he has to be consistent
in the kitchen.

27:25.208 --> 27:27.477
Otherwise,
he's  history.

27:27.510 --> 27:28.434
A strip
a half-rack,

27:28.434 --> 27:28.811
A strip
a half-rack,

27:28.845 --> 27:31.314
two filet--you got
a tomato and mozz salad, Joe.

27:31.347 --> 27:32.682
We got to rock tonight.
You ready, bro?

27:32.715 --> 27:34.984
It's nice to see my husband
off the bar stool,

27:35.018 --> 27:36.786
on his feet,
and back to work.

27:36.819 --> 27:37.887
Did you just have an order?
Yeah.

27:37.921 --> 27:39.556
Well done.
Excellent.

27:39.589 --> 27:41.824
Eric, when we start
to send the mixed grill,

27:41.858 --> 27:43.826
what I want to do is see
half the table in the window

27:43.860 --> 27:45.261
without the other half
coming at the same time.

27:45.295 --> 27:46.462
Yes, Chef.
Excellent, thank you.

27:46.496 --> 27:47.664
It makes me feel confident
when I can hear

27:47.697 --> 27:48.665
a chef's voice behind me,
you know that.

27:48.698 --> 27:49.999
Yes, Chef.

27:50.033 --> 27:51.334
Joe, I'm ready
for that tomato-mozzarella.

27:51.367 --> 27:52.435
Tomato-mozzarell.

27:52.468 --> 27:54.070
Steak medium.

27:54.103 --> 27:55.071
Slider.

27:55.104 --> 27:56.773
Just lettuce and tomato?

27:56.806 --> 27:58.141
I need a pick-up
over here.

27:58.174 --> 27:58.434
PJ's mixed grill.

27:58.434 --> 27:59.609
PJ's mixed grill.

27:59.642 --> 28:01.678
With Joe and Eric
working together,

28:01.711 --> 28:03.546
Food is leaving the kitchen
at a good pace.

28:03.580 --> 28:05.715
Here we are.

28:05.748 --> 28:07.584
And now the first mixed grill
special is hitting the table.

28:07.617 --> 28:10.553
When the first mixed grills
started to go out,

28:10.587 --> 28:12.422
You know, you could see people
in the dining room

28:12.455 --> 28:13.690
looking over
and getting excited.

28:13.723 --> 28:15.925
How's everything look?
It's really cold.

28:15.959 --> 28:16.960
Everything's cold?

28:16.993 --> 28:18.928
This is cold
and this is cold.

28:18.962 --> 28:20.730
All right, I'm sorry
about that.

28:20.763 --> 28:21.864
And that steak is still rare.
I'll be right back.

28:21.898 --> 28:23.733
Un--believable.

28:23.766 --> 28:25.802
Mushrooms are cold.
Sausage is cold.

28:25.835 --> 28:27.203
This was supposed
to be medium.

28:27.237 --> 28:28.434
Oh, come on.

28:28.434 --> 28:28.438
Oh, come on.

28:28.471 --> 28:30.106
Eric, it's the first one.

28:30.139 --> 28:32.508
It's the first  table.

28:32.542 --> 28:34.143
Come on, Eric, please, yeah?
Don't let me down, yes?

28:34.177 --> 28:35.945
Pick-up
on that PJ's mixed grill.

28:35.979 --> 28:37.714
Ordering a salmon.

28:37.747 --> 28:40.250
We got a PJ's mixed grill.
We got a calamari first.

28:40.283 --> 28:41.918
The mixed grill special

28:41.951 --> 28:43.353
is extremely popular,

28:43.386 --> 28:45.355
with 21 orders
already taken.

28:45.388 --> 28:47.223
I need a pick-up over here.
Table 12.

28:47.257 --> 28:49.292
The kitchen has pushed out 14
of them in a hurry.

28:49.325 --> 28:51.127
Here we go.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.962
Now it's time to find out

28:52.996 --> 28:55.265
If Chef Ramsay's dish,
cooked by Eric,

28:55.298 --> 28:56.666
is satisfying
the customers.

29:00.770 --> 29:02.105
How is everything?

29:02.138 --> 29:03.339
It's terrible.
I'm sorry.

29:03.373 --> 29:04.841
It's freezing cold.

29:04.874 --> 29:05.908
It was raw.

29:07.377 --> 29:08.845
I will be right back,
okay?

29:08.878 --> 29:10.146
Is everything okay?

29:10.179 --> 29:12.248
It's ice-cold.

29:12.282 --> 29:13.883
and I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry about that.

29:13.916 --> 29:15.285
I'll take it right back.

29:15.318 --> 29:16.886
Can he change that for, like,
the filet or something?

29:16.919 --> 29:19.088
He doesn't like it.
It's just dry.

29:19.122 --> 29:20.256
I'll be right back.

29:20.290 --> 29:21.257
What's wrong with that?

29:21.291 --> 29:22.458
Needs to be--
he said it's cold.

29:22.492 --> 29:24.127
Oh, come on.

29:26.529 --> 29:28.434
Does that chicken
look pink to you?

29:28.434 --> 29:28.564
Does that chicken
look pink to you?

29:28.598 --> 29:30.400
Yeah, very.

29:30.433 --> 29:31.901
Everything's coming back.

29:31.934 --> 29:33.803
Ah, I'm so  lost,
man.

29:33.836 --> 29:35.238
He hates it.
Oh, come on.

29:37.106 --> 29:38.841
This is getting worse
than last night.

29:38.875 --> 29:40.543
Eric couldn't cook a sausage.

29:40.576 --> 29:43.279
It was...

29:43.313 --> 29:44.747
sad.

29:44.781 --> 29:46.316
What's going on here, guys?

29:46.349 --> 29:47.784
There's one simple  dish
on there

29:47.817 --> 29:49.552
to make things look
somewhat easier.

29:49.585 --> 29:51.154
Yeah, real  simple.

29:51.187 --> 29:52.355
Scumbag.

29:52.388 --> 29:53.990
I've never, ever, ever,

29:54.023 --> 29:55.491
ever seen it this bad.

29:55.525 --> 29:57.560
I don't care anymore.
Let's stop the madness.

29:57.593 --> 29:58.434
- Stop it.
- Close the  door.

29:58.434 --> 29:59.696
- Stop it.
- Close the  door.

29:59.729 --> 30:01.731
Close the door...

30:09.268 --> 30:10.636
It's an hour
into dinner service,

30:10.670 --> 30:13.139
and with food coming back
at a ridiculous rate...

30:13.172 --> 30:15.374
He hates it.
Oh, come on.

30:15.408 --> 30:16.442
Eric completely giving up...

30:17.443 --> 30:19.112
Chef Ramsay knows he is left

30:19.145 --> 30:20.279
with just one choice.

30:20.313 --> 30:21.514
Let's stop the madness.

30:21.547 --> 30:23.983
- Stop it.
- Close the  door.

30:24.016 --> 30:25.485
Close the  door..

30:28.688 --> 30:30.723
Close the  door.

30:30.756 --> 30:32.959
It was his last shot.

30:32.992 --> 30:34.527
And he didn't perform.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.405
It's a serious problem.

30:36.405 --> 30:37.463
It's a serious problem.

30:39.532 --> 30:40.733
No lie.
Our chef's walked out.

30:40.766 --> 30:42.869
They're shutting down
the kitchen.

30:42.902 --> 30:44.804
After shutting down
dinner service,

30:44.837 --> 30:47.340
Chef Ramsay calls
an emergency meeting

30:47.373 --> 30:48.474
with the owners.

30:48.508 --> 30:50.243
You cannot continue
like this.

30:50.276 --> 30:51.811
I'm trying my best,

30:51.844 --> 30:55.148
and I cannot work
with no tools in there.

30:56.716 --> 30:58.384
He's a cook,
but he's not a chef.

30:58.417 --> 31:01.420
There's a lot of money
invested here.

31:01.454 --> 31:03.256
And if I have to choose
between a future

31:03.289 --> 31:05.958
and a chef, I have
to choose the business.

31:05.992 --> 31:06.405
He needs to go.

31:06.405 --> 31:07.727
He needs to go.

31:07.760 --> 31:10.296
We need
a new kitchen leader.

31:10.329 --> 31:11.597
It was a no-brainer.

31:11.631 --> 31:15.201
Please give me
a real chef.

31:15.234 --> 31:16.536
I am willing

31:16.569 --> 31:18.171
to bring a chef in here

31:18.204 --> 31:19.605
and pay personally

31:19.639 --> 31:21.240
for that chef to help

31:21.274 --> 31:23.776
turn this business around
for the first month.

31:23.809 --> 31:25.378
But that's your decision.

31:25.411 --> 31:28.648
You can't ask
for more than that.

31:28.681 --> 31:30.383
You're the owners,
and it's your call.

31:31.918 --> 31:33.619
See you in the morning.

31:33.653 --> 31:35.655
We had to make a quick decision.

31:35.688 --> 31:36.405
We couldn't let it linger on.

31:36.405 --> 31:36.856
We couldn't let it linger on.

31:36.889 --> 31:38.524
We had to rip
the band-aid off, you know?

31:41.661 --> 31:43.729
Come outside.

31:43.763 --> 31:47.533
At this point in time,
if I don't do something,

31:47.567 --> 31:49.936
it's not gonna be here
at all.

31:52.638 --> 31:56.375
I can't lose
a million dollars.

31:56.409 --> 31:58.077
- You know what?
- I think it's all.

31:59.512 --> 32:01.347
We should go whatever direction

32:01.380 --> 32:02.949
we have to go in.

32:06.719 --> 32:08.854
We got to move on,
my friend.

32:11.924 --> 32:13.926
If my  not good enough,

32:13.960 --> 32:14.961
Let 'em find somebody else

32:14.994 --> 32:16.095
'cause I'm  done
with it.

32:20.933 --> 32:24.170
It's time for a 360,
you know?

32:24.203 --> 32:25.738
Getting rid of Eric,
it was tough.

32:25.771 --> 32:27.840
But what's best
for the restaurant

32:27.873 --> 32:30.409
is the way I'm gonna go.

32:30.443 --> 32:34.146
He's not the only thing
that has to change here.

32:36.849 --> 32:38.484
I need to get back
on my feet

32:38.517 --> 32:40.319
and start paying attention
to the business.

32:40.353 --> 32:41.754
And Joe does also.

32:41.787 --> 32:44.056
It's gotta be becoming
about keeping this place open

32:44.090 --> 32:45.258
and money.

32:45.291 --> 32:47.260
Joe and I need
to keep this place going.

32:59.038 --> 33:01.374
With chef Eric now
out of the picture,

33:01.407 --> 33:03.643
Chef Ramsay is ready
to present his plan

33:03.676 --> 33:04.910
for the new PJ's.

33:04.944 --> 33:05.978
How are we feeling?

33:06.012 --> 33:06.405
Great.

33:06.405 --> 33:07.046
Great.

33:07.079 --> 33:08.281
It's been a tough week,
yes?

33:08.314 --> 33:09.782
Time to put all that
aside.

33:09.815 --> 33:11.417
This is not just a new chapter.

33:11.450 --> 33:13.819
This is a new book.

33:13.853 --> 33:15.388
Are you ready?

33:15.421 --> 33:19.025
Yes?
The steakhouse has closed.

33:19.058 --> 33:22.762
PJ's Grill is now open.

33:22.795 --> 33:25.264
Look at that.

33:25.298 --> 33:27.967
That's beautiful.
Inviting. Sumptuous.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.135
Rich.
It's clear.

33:29.168 --> 33:32.338
PJ's Grill.

33:32.371 --> 33:33.806
I think
it's a wonderful idea.

33:33.839 --> 33:36.042
I think it's perfect
for the neighborhood.

33:36.075 --> 33:36.405
Right.
Should we go inside?

33:36.405 --> 33:37.143
Right.
Should we go inside?

33:37.176 --> 33:38.611
Yeah.
Yes?

33:38.644 --> 33:39.979
Let's go.

33:42.048 --> 33:44.583
The important part
of keeping PJ's--

33:44.617 --> 33:46.052
absolutely crucial...
oh, my God, Joe.

33:46.085 --> 33:48.721
This area here

33:48.754 --> 33:51.390
is dedicated to him.

33:51.424 --> 33:54.393
Now it has a proper meaning.

33:54.427 --> 33:58.397
And more importantly,
what a lovely tribute.

34:01.500 --> 34:02.735
It's beautiful.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.476
It brought a tear
to my eye, you know?

34:10.509 --> 34:13.913
It's a good reminder of why
this place is called PJ's.

34:13.946 --> 34:17.483
I feel PJ's presence here today.

34:17.516 --> 34:19.185
Thank you so much.

34:20.386 --> 34:22.722
Thank you.

34:24.757 --> 34:26.092
Madalyn, Joe,

34:26.125 --> 34:28.494
Two seconds?

34:28.527 --> 34:30.496
I want to introduce you
to your new chef.

34:30.529 --> 34:31.831
This is Mark.

34:31.864 --> 34:33.699
Mark Elliott,
Madalyn the owner.

34:33.733 --> 34:35.801
Lovely to meet you.
And Joe, the owner.

34:35.835 --> 34:36.405
I'm really excited
to be here.

34:36.405 --> 34:37.203
I'm really excited
to be here.

34:37.236 --> 34:38.237
Oh, we're excited
to have you.

34:38.270 --> 34:39.238
Likewise, Mark.

34:39.271 --> 34:40.740
I'm just so excited.

34:40.773 --> 34:42.608
I just can't wait
to taste his food.

34:42.641 --> 34:44.377
I just can't wait
to see

34:44.410 --> 34:45.778
the reaction
of the customers.

34:45.811 --> 34:47.113
He knows his food inside-out.

34:47.146 --> 34:48.647
And he knows
how to cook.

34:48.681 --> 34:50.015
Let me tell you that.

34:50.049 --> 34:52.718
Yeah, it's a long story.
I'll explain later.

34:52.752 --> 34:53.786
Just having someone new

34:53.819 --> 34:56.021
And professional

34:56.055 --> 34:57.723
with ideas
in this restaurant,

34:57.757 --> 34:59.658
it'll motivate
and turn things around.

35:01.394 --> 35:03.329
With Joe and Madalyn
embracing Chef Ramsay's plan...

35:03.362 --> 35:05.164
Right.

35:05.197 --> 35:06.405
He now introduces
the new menu for PJ's Grill.

35:06.405 --> 35:07.500
He now introduces
the new menu for PJ's Grill.

35:07.533 --> 35:09.668
Time for some dramatic change

35:09.702 --> 35:10.870
with the food.

35:10.903 --> 35:12.371
I'm excited
about this part.

35:12.405 --> 35:14.440
This is the bit
that really gets me fired up.

35:14.473 --> 35:15.574
Quick run through the menu,
yes?

35:15.608 --> 35:18.077
Small, fresh,
casual.

35:18.110 --> 35:20.012
And more importantly,
fast.

35:20.045 --> 35:21.414
Irish stew.

35:21.447 --> 35:22.882
Chicken scaloppini.
Classic.

35:22.915 --> 35:24.250
Okay?

35:24.283 --> 35:25.251
Steak frites.
We're a grill.

35:25.284 --> 35:26.886
So we got
the most amazing grill,

35:26.919 --> 35:28.053
the most amazing steak frites.

35:28.087 --> 35:29.755
Okay, happy?
Good.

35:29.789 --> 35:31.223
Madalyn, I need two seconds
with you, please.

35:31.257 --> 35:32.458
Sure.
Yeah? Come with me, darling.

35:32.491 --> 35:36.228
Good.
Excellent.

35:36.262 --> 35:36.405
There's one last change.

35:36.405 --> 35:38.631
There's one last change.

35:38.664 --> 35:40.266
What I need to see
from you tonight,

35:40.299 --> 35:42.268
more than anything,
is just warmth

35:42.301 --> 35:44.336
with the customers.

35:44.370 --> 35:46.872
I want the burden
off your shoulders tonight.

35:46.906 --> 35:49.275
And the only way
around that, okay,

35:49.308 --> 35:51.644
was to bring in someone
very special.

35:51.677 --> 35:53.012
And it's someone

35:53.045 --> 35:54.380
I trust
with my restaurant.

35:54.413 --> 35:55.915
This man handles
250 staff a day.

35:55.948 --> 35:58.117
And he's here tonight
to help you.

35:58.150 --> 35:59.585
Hey, Gordon.
Come say hello.

35:59.618 --> 36:00.586
Top of the morning.
Nice to meet you.

36:00.619 --> 36:01.587
How are you?
How are you, sir?

36:01.620 --> 36:03.055
Good.

36:03.088 --> 36:04.690
When you're worried
about what's gonna happen next

36:04.723 --> 36:06.325
or what to say next
or how to handle a situation,

36:06.358 --> 36:06.405
there's your buffer.
don't be scared

36:06.405 --> 36:08.360
there's your buffer.
don't be scared

36:08.394 --> 36:10.095
to ask questions
and get out there with it.

36:10.129 --> 36:11.397
Okay?
All right.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.332
Chef Ramsay loans his manager

36:13.365 --> 36:14.333
to train me.

36:14.366 --> 36:15.835
Is this unbelievable?

36:15.868 --> 36:17.603
I only hope we perform

36:17.636 --> 36:18.771
with the faith
he's giving us, you know?

36:18.804 --> 36:21.207
Otherwise,
that's the end of it.

36:30.727 --> 36:31.895
It's the big night.

36:31.929 --> 36:34.898
This restaurant has been
transformed in 24 hours

36:34.931 --> 36:37.534
from a steakhouse
to a neighborhood grill.

36:37.567 --> 36:39.502
Even though Chef Ramsay
has brought in a new chef...

36:39.536 --> 36:40.971
Okay?
Yeah, oui, Chef.

36:41.004 --> 36:42.138
Feeling good.

36:42.172 --> 36:43.173
And his own manager...

36:43.206 --> 36:44.374
Okay, are we all set?

36:44.407 --> 36:45.842
PJ's fate still rests

36:45.875 --> 36:47.177
With Madalyn
and Joe.

36:52.649 --> 36:55.385
This is a huge night
for PJ's

36:55.418 --> 36:57.385
Because people are coming back
here for the first time,

36:57.385 --> 36:59.489
Because people are coming back
here for the first time,

36:59.522 --> 37:02.192
they're going to sit down to
hopefully a new Madalyn and Joe.

37:02.225 --> 37:03.927
We need this launch to go well.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.229
Otherwise, you know,
we'll have no choice.

37:06.262 --> 37:08.264
We'll have to close the door.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.468
Good evening.
Hello.

37:11.501 --> 37:12.769
Good evening.
Welcome to PJ's.

37:12.802 --> 37:13.770
How are you guys doing?

37:13.803 --> 37:14.871
Delighted to have you
with us, okay?

37:14.904 --> 37:16.806
Enjoy your evening.

37:21.044 --> 37:23.079
30 minutes into dinner service,

37:23.113 --> 37:26.116
A surprise guest
from the past shows up.

37:26.149 --> 37:27.385
Hi, good evening.
How are you?

37:27.385 --> 37:28.118
Hi, good evening.
How are you?

37:28.151 --> 37:29.586
Welcome to PJ's.

37:29.619 --> 37:30.687
I know you.
Do you?

37:30.720 --> 37:32.155
I do.

37:32.188 --> 37:34.057
When was the last visit
to PJ's?

37:34.090 --> 37:35.592
Six months ago.
I boycotted it.

37:35.625 --> 37:36.893
They never cook
their steak right.

37:36.926 --> 37:38.595
The service, terrible.

37:38.628 --> 37:40.697
If you have any problems,
please,

37:40.730 --> 37:42.198
ask for Madalyn right away.

37:42.232 --> 37:43.600
Madalyn.

37:43.633 --> 37:44.868
I was shocked
that he's back

37:44.901 --> 37:47.037
for a surprise visit,
and I hope

37:47.070 --> 37:49.005
that we won't disappoint him.

37:49.039 --> 37:52.075
Enjoy.
Please.

37:53.777 --> 37:55.645
This guy had a lot
of negative feedback

37:55.678 --> 37:56.846
about the restaurant.

37:56.880 --> 37:57.385
The young couple
that just walked in, is it?

37:57.385 --> 37:58.281
The young couple
that just walked in, is it?

37:58.314 --> 37:59.816
Yes.

38:04.788 --> 38:07.657
Table ten, people
that have eaten here before.

38:07.690 --> 38:08.925
They were
in your film actually.

38:08.958 --> 38:10.193
So previous customers

38:10.226 --> 38:11.594
that complained last time
they were here.

38:11.628 --> 38:12.595
So watch that ticket, yeah?
Yeah.

38:12.629 --> 38:14.998
Let's go.
Hi, how are you?

38:15.031 --> 38:16.466
I'd probably recommend
the mixed grill.

38:16.499 --> 38:17.767
The grill does look
kind of interesting.

38:17.801 --> 38:19.369
We're gonna try
the mixed grill.

38:19.402 --> 38:20.670
Great.
Thank you.

38:20.703 --> 38:22.405
All right, first order--
stuffed mushrooms,

38:22.439 --> 38:23.807
house salad, and house salad.

38:23.840 --> 38:25.041
Three of mixed grill.

38:25.075 --> 38:26.676
That's gonna be the hit tonight,
kids.

38:26.709 --> 38:27.385
So there are two different
temperatures on one mixed grill.

38:27.385 --> 38:28.845
So there are two different
temperatures on one mixed grill.

38:28.878 --> 38:29.913
Yeah, we cut the steak
in half and leave

38:29.946 --> 38:30.914
half of it in there
a little bit longer.

38:30.947 --> 38:32.015
I love that flexibility.

38:32.048 --> 38:33.983
Music to my  ears.

38:34.017 --> 38:34.984
You're welcome.

38:35.018 --> 38:36.519
How we doing, guys?
Very good.

38:36.553 --> 38:37.620
How's that stew?
It's good.

38:37.654 --> 38:39.122
You guys have to get this
next time.

38:39.155 --> 38:41.057
I'll come back for this.
This is awesome.

38:41.091 --> 38:42.826
With the kitchen functioning

38:42.859 --> 38:44.327
In a cohesive
and professional manner...

38:44.360 --> 38:45.762
Isn't that good?

38:45.795 --> 38:47.097
Oh, that's good.

38:47.130 --> 38:48.832
Madalyn.

38:48.865 --> 38:49.933
Madalyn is about to get

38:49.966 --> 38:51.901
Her first of many lessons

38:51.935 --> 38:53.203
in proper management.
Madalyn.

38:53.236 --> 38:55.105
What's wrong with this guy?

38:55.138 --> 38:57.340
It's ridiculous.
Cut it out.

38:57.373 --> 38:57.385
Don't go.
Please don't go anywhere.

38:57.385 --> 38:59.442
Don't go.
Please don't go anywhere.

38:59.476 --> 39:02.445
I'll be right back.
Okay. Okay.

39:02.479 --> 39:03.913
That's it.
That's your last break.

39:03.947 --> 39:05.548
I didn't get the break.

39:05.582 --> 39:07.083
I never left.
Okay, go chase your waiters.

39:07.117 --> 39:08.218
Let's find out.
Come on.

39:08.251 --> 39:10.753
Enda was following me
everywhere.

39:10.787 --> 39:12.222
You need to go find out
from the kitchen

39:12.255 --> 39:13.490
what we have,
what we don't have.

39:13.523 --> 39:14.791
There's no one there.
Let's get back in.

39:14.824 --> 39:15.892
Let's check on the table four.

39:15.925 --> 39:17.827
I didn't realize

39:17.861 --> 39:19.562
How many places
you had to be.

39:26.536 --> 39:27.385
Dinner service is off
to a strong start.

39:27.385 --> 39:28.671
Dinner service is off
to a strong start.

39:28.705 --> 39:29.706
We need to find out

39:29.739 --> 39:30.807
what's happening
with table ten.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.642
But the former customers,

39:32.675 --> 39:35.812
whose opinion signifies whether
PJ's has really changed...

39:35.845 --> 39:37.714
Did you eat anything yet?

39:37.747 --> 39:40.016
Has yet to be served.

39:40.049 --> 39:42.051
You haven't been fed yet?

39:42.085 --> 39:43.753
I'll be right back.

39:43.786 --> 39:46.723
Before this critical customer
walks out the door,

39:46.756 --> 39:48.625
Madalyn must get her kitchen
under control.

39:48.658 --> 39:50.994
Table ten hasn't been fed yet.

39:52.896 --> 39:54.664
What the  now?

39:54.697 --> 39:56.065
Who's sending food
to the wrong tables, guys?

39:56.099 --> 39:57.385
Take care.
Thank you.

39:57.385 --> 39:57.500
Take care.
Thank you.

39:57.534 --> 39:59.536
Oh,.

39:59.569 --> 40:01.371
Oh,.

40:01.404 --> 40:04.140
Table ten.
We're just a little behind
right now.

40:04.174 --> 40:06.309
Okay, Chef,
they're starving.

40:06.342 --> 40:08.778
So they need something,
and they need it now.

40:08.811 --> 40:10.613
Take it, Mark.
Let's go.

40:10.647 --> 40:11.848
Please take a breath.
Take the pressure off.

40:11.881 --> 40:13.750
Don't worry.
Working hard.

40:13.783 --> 40:15.451
Give me two minutes.

40:15.485 --> 40:17.020
You okay?
Beautiful, baby.

40:17.053 --> 40:18.221
Flank steak, a slider,
grilled chicken.

40:18.254 --> 40:19.589
Whoo--that's beautiful.

40:19.622 --> 40:20.857
Yes.
Come here. Pick-up.

40:20.890 --> 40:22.058
Mixed grill, window.

40:22.091 --> 40:23.293
Let's not take this

40:23.326 --> 40:24.627
to the wrong table
a second time, please.

40:24.661 --> 40:25.795
Really well-handled
with that.

40:25.828 --> 40:26.963
Really well-handled
in the kitchen.

40:26.996 --> 40:27.385
Thank you.
Here we are.

40:27.385 --> 40:30.066
Thank you.
Here we are.

40:31.367 --> 40:32.502
Thank you.
You're welcome.

40:32.535 --> 40:34.103
Want to dig in?
Let's dig in.

40:37.841 --> 40:40.243
Hi, how are you?
How's everything?

40:48.351 --> 40:49.719
Thank you.

40:49.752 --> 40:51.187
They're happy
with the new menu.

40:51.221 --> 40:52.288
They're happy
with the food.

40:52.322 --> 40:54.958
He said
he was definitely coming back.

40:54.991 --> 40:56.960
Oh, it makes me feel so good.

40:56.993 --> 40:57.385
So good.

40:57.385 --> 40:58.561
So good.

40:58.595 --> 40:59.829
So please enjoy
your dinner.

40:59.863 --> 41:01.364
Thank you.

41:02.699 --> 41:04.234
Everyone loves everything,
man.

41:04.267 --> 41:05.902
Hey, you know what?
It's all for you, Joe.

41:08.004 --> 41:10.406
You're a different person
when you have confidence

41:10.440 --> 41:11.708
in your chef.

41:11.741 --> 41:12.876
Everybody is rocking
and rolling.

41:12.909 --> 41:14.043
Nice job
across the board.

41:14.077 --> 41:16.779
I was actually very proud
to be

41:16.813 --> 41:19.549
owner of PJ's Grill.

41:21.818 --> 41:24.020
Chef Ramsay's vision

41:24.053 --> 41:25.655
of PJ's Grill was realized.

41:25.688 --> 41:26.756
How'd you feel?

41:26.789 --> 41:27.385
Great.

41:27.385 --> 41:28.157
Great.

41:28.191 --> 41:29.359
It was a team effort

41:29.392 --> 41:30.360
that was led by the new chef,

41:30.393 --> 41:31.594
Madalyn, and Joe.

41:31.628 --> 41:33.763
Tonight, PJ's Grill

41:33.796 --> 41:35.331
served 90 customers

41:35.365 --> 41:36.966
who loved the food

41:37.000 --> 41:38.134
and, more importantly,

41:38.167 --> 41:39.802
are coming back

41:39.836 --> 41:41.304
because they've had
a great time.

41:41.337 --> 41:43.006
The difference,

41:43.039 --> 41:45.975
just with a decent chef
in the kitchen,

41:46.009 --> 41:48.011
doing his job
that he's paid to do...

41:49.712 --> 41:50.680
What a weight
off your shoulders.

41:50.713 --> 41:52.015
But the most important thing

41:52.048 --> 41:54.317
is I saw two owners

41:54.350 --> 41:56.319
who were passionate,
happy,

41:56.352 --> 41:57.385
and dealing
with their business.

41:57.385 --> 41:58.154
and dealing
with their business.

41:58.187 --> 42:00.223
What Chef Ramsay's done here

42:00.256 --> 42:01.291
is incredible.

42:01.324 --> 42:02.425
I don't really know
how he knew

42:02.458 --> 42:04.394
how to go to the heart
of Joe.

42:04.427 --> 42:06.896
But he did.
It's just been unreal.

42:06.930 --> 42:08.131
It's like I just got

42:08.164 --> 42:10.366
a fire back,
you know?

42:10.400 --> 42:12.502
I haven't felt that way
in a long time.

42:12.535 --> 42:13.803
This is the first time

42:13.836 --> 42:16.306
in a lot of years

42:16.339 --> 42:19.242
I feel my brother's looking down
on me, you know?

42:19.275 --> 42:22.312
Look over my shoulder.

42:22.345 --> 42:23.313
You can do it.

42:23.346 --> 42:24.814
Thank you so much.

42:24.847 --> 42:26.616
Thank you.
Good night.

42:31.821 --> 42:32.989
During my stay here,

42:33.022 --> 42:34.958
it's been dark, rainy,
and gloomy.

42:34.991 --> 42:36.926
And I'm not just talking
about the weather.

42:36.960 --> 42:38.661
But based
on what I saw tonight

42:38.695 --> 42:40.096
in this restaurant,

42:40.129 --> 42:42.398
I seriously hope
that tomorrow the sun shines

42:42.432 --> 42:45.001
on PJ's Grill
and into the future.

42:45.034 --> 42:47.036
'Cause it deserves it.

42:51.975 --> 42:55.578
After Chef Ramsay left,
PJ's business did improve,

42:55.612 --> 42:57.385
but after a great deal
of thought,

42:57.385 --> 42:57.647
but after a great deal
of thought,

42:57.680 --> 42:59.182
Joe and Madalyn made

42:59.215 --> 43:01.884
the most difficult business
decision of their life.

43:01.918 --> 43:03.853
They decided to close PJ's Grill

43:03.886 --> 43:09.492
and return
to the construction business.
