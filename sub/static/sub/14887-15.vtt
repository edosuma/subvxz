Balki, I have to tell you,
I was a little bit worried

01:24.903 --> 01:27.976
about eating a complete Myposian
dinner, but this was delicious.

01:28.009 --> 01:29.980
Oh, thank you, thank you.

It is quite a challenge
to use every part of the animal.

01:35.658 --> 01:38.764
Well, a Myposian dinner
calls for a Myposian dessert.

01:38.798 --> 01:42.404
And I've made you
the dessert of kings.

the first Bibbi Babkas

01:56.800 --> 01:59.740

Balki your Bibbi Babkas

I think you could sell them.

is interested.
