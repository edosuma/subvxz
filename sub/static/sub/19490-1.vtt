Your father was
family to all of us.

03:49.671 --> 03:52.839
He was so proud of your research
at the pharmaceutical company.

03:52.874 --> 03:55.775
Yeah, he would have been
over the moon to have me here.

03:55.811 --> 03:57.611
That was his dream--

03:57.679 --> 04:00.279
Him the Nose, the
perfume designer

04:00.315 --> 04:02.649
with the uncanny
sense of smell.

04:02.684 --> 04:05.719
And you, the

04:05.754 --> 04:08.421
He was always happiest when
you would arrive for the summer

04:08.456 --> 04:10.890
and the two of you
worked side by side.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.459
You made
quite the team.

04:13.495 --> 04:15.962
Yes we did.

04:15.998 --> 04:20.466
You know, I planned on coming
back once my contract was up.

04:26.407 --> 04:28.474

04:28.510 --> 04:30.777

04:38.520 --> 04:39.552

04:39.587 --> 04:40.887
Are you going to stay

04:40.956 --> 04:43.089

had hoped?

04:43.125 --> 04:46.492

restructuring is what he does

and he wants to help me with
my father's business affairs.

04:57.572 --> 04:59.973
You know, he thinks maybe
I should bring someone in,

05:00.008 --> 05:02.642
you know, to help
run the company.

05:03.645 --> 05:06.512

05:28.003 --> 05:29.435

05:47.155 --> 05:49.089
Harv has called me

I mean, he's expecting
SKY as we speak.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.693
If I don't find the formula,
I can't deliver the trilogy?

05:53.729 --> 05:56.129
Well listen, at least your
Father left you a sample.

05:56.164 --> 05:58.564
I'm sure it won't be too
hard for your machines

05:58.600 --> 06:00.033
to come up
with the formula.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.001
The machines can break down
the Perfume's ingredients,

06:02.037 --> 06:03.469
they're just not
100 percent accurate

06:03.504 --> 06:05.171
because my father's
blends were so complex.

06:05.207 --> 06:08.341
That's why you need a Perfumer,
or a Nose, whatever you call it.

06:08.376 --> 06:10.043

20:03.210 --> 20:04.376

my family--

20:04.445 --> 20:07.212
well, I, own a

20:07.247 --> 20:11.349
exactly twelve days

call a Nose, you know,

20:13.821 --> 20:16.354
someone who has a
phenomenal sense of smell.

20:16.390 --> 20:19.959
And I'm here because I
want to offer you a job.

20:19.994 --> 20:21.460
I've already

20:21.528 --> 20:24.663

of a lifetime.

20:24.699 --> 20:27.066
To smell perfume?

20:27.101 --> 20:30.168
I'll have you know that Napoleon
used 54 bottles of cologne

20:30.204 --> 20:33.238
every month and he always wore
his favorite scent into battle.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.107

he was exiled?

your sense of smell.

perfume-- it's the ultimate.

29:34.350 --> 29:36.617
<i>Yeah, it's been in</i>

what to do with it.

29:40.089 --> 29:41.622

a Nut Bar?

29:41.658 --> 29:44.692

nuttered out, thanks.

29:45.094 --> 29:46.661

you drawing?

29:46.696 --> 29:48.429
Just some ideas.

29:48.464 --> 29:49.830
Wow.

29:50.132 --> 29:52.099
How did you
end up here?

29:52.168 --> 29:54.936
I just came down the
path from the gate...

29:54.971 --> 29:57.872
No, how did you
end up in Bruges?

30:00.577 --> 30:03.744
It's a long,
boring story.

30:03.780 --> 30:05.880
Were you
always a Botanist?

30:05.915 --> 30:06.914
Nope.

30:06.983 --> 30:07.481
No?

30:07.516 --> 30:08.983

you before?

30:10.653 --> 30:11.719

30:11.754 --> 30:15.122

trader in New York.

Really?

30:15.692 --> 30:16.090
Yeah.

30:16.125 --> 30:16.490
No way.

30:16.559 --> 30:17.458
Yeah.

30:17.493 --> 30:18.759
Pressed suits.

30:19.062 --> 30:20.494
Pot of coffee
for breakfast.

30:20.529 --> 30:22.697
A granola
bar for lunch.

30:22.765 --> 30:26.567
Kinda like your Nut Bars,
but not nearly as delightful.

30:27.269 --> 30:30.270
One day I just
gave it all up.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.439
I started travelling through
Europe for four months,

30:32.508 --> 30:35.542
and spent the last three
years here in Belgium.

30:36.479 --> 30:37.478
Wow.

30:37.546 --> 30:38.545
Um-hmm.

30:38.581 --> 30:41.548

your previous life?

30:41.618 --> 30:42.850
No,...

30:42.919 --> 30:44.685
No, I really
love what I do.

30:44.721 --> 30:46.253
Take this ivy
for example.

30:46.322 --> 30:49.189
Most people look at that and
they just see a plant, right?

30:49.258 --> 30:53.193
I see hope, the
promise of life.

30:53.663 --> 30:55.029
Nature's all
around us.

30:55.064 --> 30:58.432
You just need to slow
down and breathe it in.

30:58.467 --> 31:00.234
I don't know, I'm
fascinated by it.

31:00.302 --> 31:02.369
Kind of like your
fascination for perfume.

31:02.438 --> 31:04.304
Yes.

31:04.741 --> 31:08.809
Okay, so how do you go from
the trading stocks to Botany?

31:08.845 --> 31:09.810
It's so different.

31:09.846 --> 31:10.945
Oh man...

31:10.980 --> 31:12.546
Actually, my degree is
in Botanical Science,

31:12.581 --> 31:14.982
I had student loans,
I had to them pay off,

31:15.018 --> 31:17.451
so I decided to
take the faster path.

31:17.486 --> 31:19.353
I started trading
stocks on Wall Street

31:19.388 --> 31:22.089
rather than planting
stalks in gardens.

31:22.125 --> 31:26.060
It seemed like an easy
choice at first, and then...

31:26.095 --> 31:27.862
I dunno, it just
wasn't for me.

31:27.897 --> 31:32.667
So I followed my gut, traded in
my cubicle for wide open spaces.

31:33.402 --> 31:35.770
It was the best
job upgrade ever.

31:36.939 --> 31:38.639
I'm impressed.

31:38.708 --> 31:41.142
Well for what it's worth, I
think it's really courageous

31:41.177 --> 31:44.311
that you gave it all up and
you followed your passion.

31:44.380 --> 31:45.746
It's really wonderful.

31:45.782 --> 31:47.381
Oh, thank you.

31:47.884 --> 31:49.616
So I've been
meaning to ask you.

31:49.652 --> 31:53.220
Why do you wear this perfume
vial around your neck?

31:53.255 --> 31:56.523
This is SKY, it's
the last of the Trilogy

31:56.592 --> 32:00.194
and I owe it to the
distributor in eleven days.

32:00.229 --> 32:00.861
Eleven days?

32:00.897 --> 32:01.395
Really?

32:01.463 --> 32:03.664
Yeah.

32:03.733 --> 32:05.132
We don't have the
formula anymore,

32:05.201 --> 32:08.435
our Master Perfumer
is no longer with us.

32:08.470 --> 32:10.771
He couldn't have just
waited a few more days?

32:10.807 --> 32:13.741
Well, that's where
your job comes in.

32:13.810 --> 32:15.810
You're gonna
help us copy it.

32:15.845 --> 32:17.078
Really?

32:17.113 --> 32:19.180
The last time I copied
something was in third grade

32:19.215 --> 32:20.647
from the kid
next to me.

32:20.683 --> 32:21.816
I still failed.

32:21.851 --> 32:23.951
Well, you just picked
the wrong kid then.

32:23.986 --> 32:26.187
Apparently.

32:26.823 --> 32:29.990

38:15.608 --> 38:16.540
It was my fault.

38:16.576 --> 38:17.741
It was completely
insensitive.

38:17.777 --> 38:21.579
I just didn't know
about your father.

38:23.116 --> 38:25.350
You must
really miss him.

38:25.385 --> 38:27.118
I do.

38:27.153 --> 38:28.853
Every day.

38:29.822 --> 38:33.691
Being here, and all
the memories just...

38:34.760 --> 38:37.561
I miss the little
things, you know?

38:37.597 --> 38:41.432
He used to walk the halls
and hum without knowing.

38:42.035 --> 38:46.537
He wore these glasses
that he didn't even need.

38:46.906 --> 38:51.542
And he snorted when he laughed
and he never ate anything green

38:51.577 --> 38:53.344
unless I
forced him to.

38:53.380 --> 38:55.646
Well that
sounds familiar.

38:56.383 --> 38:58.016
He was fun.

38:58.051 --> 39:00.151
Creative.

39:00.487 --> 39:02.253
I remember
when I was--

39:02.489 --> 39:06.324
When I was five, he bought
me this pair of rain boots...

39:06.359 --> 39:10.128
I wore them every day,
just willing it to rain.

39:10.163 --> 39:13.297
Spring came and went
and it never rained.

39:13.666 --> 39:14.999
So he
scooped me up

39:15.035 --> 39:18.569
and brought me outside
under this apple blossom tree.

39:18.604 --> 39:19.870
He shook all
the branches

39:19.906 --> 39:23.908
so that it rained apple
blossoms on me and my boots.

39:24.210 --> 39:25.109
Wow...

39:25.178 --> 39:27.978
Sounds like he
was one-of-a-kind.

39:28.014 --> 39:29.880
He was the best.

39:31.051 --> 39:35.119
Yeah, he had the
greatest sense of smell.

39:35.555 --> 39:37.688
You know, every time he
created a new perfume

39:37.723 --> 39:42.326
he'd put a few of the
drops into a vial for me.

39:44.030 --> 39:46.431
I have all
the vials.

39:46.966 --> 39:49.900
This is the last one I'll
ever get from him though.

39:53.739 --> 39:56.107
I can't sell
this place.

39:56.909 --> 39:58.443
Everybody thinks
that I'm crazy.

39:58.511 --> 40:00.478
But I can't.

40:01.181 --> 40:02.613

40:02.648 --> 40:04.848
She's everything
my Father wasn't.

40:04.884 --> 40:06.250
Wait, Caine?

40:06.319 --> 40:09.287
Olivia Caine is this woman who
has made millions of dollars

40:09.322 --> 40:11.755
copying other
peoples' perfumes.

40:13.059 --> 40:15.193
But she's never been
able to copy my Father's

40:15.261 --> 40:18.129
because his blends
are too complex.

40:19.165 --> 40:21.699
Now she's begging
to buy us out.

40:24.571 --> 40:26.971

take her up on her offer.

Five thousand by

foundation, okay?

01:11:38.907 --> 01:11:41.742

tweak it just a little bit,

still deliver to Harv on time.

be able to...

the Apple Blossoms?

do that.

01:21:04.911 --> 01:21:06.644
Au revoir.

01:21:06.679 --> 01:21:09.080
And you said you
didn't have any family.

01:21:09.115 --> 01:21:12.249
I guess they were hiding
under my nose the whole time.

01:21:13.319 --> 01:21:14.485
Terrible.

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.519
<i>(laughing)</i>

01:21:15.588 --> 01:21:17.622
Ty, thank you.

01:21:21.995 --> 01:21:22.793
Thanks man.

01:21:22.829 --> 01:21:24.528
Any time.

01:21:25.531 --> 01:21:27.498
You sure you
know the way?

01:21:27.533 --> 01:21:31.268
I'm good, I've got a
special navigation system.

01:21:32.438 --> 01:21:34.304
Oh really?

01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:36.306
Special.

01:21:36.342 --> 01:21:37.842
Iced Matcha, Monday.

01:21:37.877 --> 01:21:39.810
You two
don't get lost.

01:21:43.916 --> 01:21:46.083
<i>(car pulling away)</i>

01:21:49.588 --> 01:21:51.588
So I think I
get it now.

01:21:51.624 --> 01:21:55.126
Making perfume is not
like hydrogen bonds.

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:56.593
Really?

01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:57.128
Yeah.

01:21:57.163 --> 01:21:58.062
It's like...

01:21:58.097 --> 01:21:59.196
It's like falling
for a girl.

01:21:59.231 --> 01:22:00.998
Oh, come on...

01:22:01.034 --> 01:22:01.932
Hear me out.

01:22:01.968 --> 01:22:03.333
Okay, so the
Head note, right?

01:22:03.402 --> 01:22:06.070
That's the
thrill, the chase...

01:22:06.105 --> 01:22:07.872
I like this
analogy, keep going.

01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:09.140
Okay.

01:22:09.175 --> 01:22:11.842
The Ground note, it's
a little less frenzied.

01:22:11.878 --> 01:22:16.580
That's where the vibe grows
and the soul gets sucked in.

01:22:18.051 --> 01:22:19.817
And then the
Heart note...

01:22:21.954 --> 01:22:24.621
That's the one you just
can't get out of your system.

No.

01:22:40.973 --> 01:22:42.039
We did good.
