Drew. drew, just--

00:02.830 --> 00:04.260
Just stop.

00:04.330 --> 00:05.400
I get it.

00:05.460 --> 00:07.160
That's why allison
is with you.

00:07.230 --> 00:09.100
Oh, god.

00:09.160 --> 00:11.560
I am dealing with it.

00:11.630 --> 00:14.530
Ben!

00:14.600 --> 00:18.100
Well, you took her
from me, remember?

00:20.100 --> 00:22.560
Ben, i thought
you paid the bill.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.630
Ben?

00:43.330 --> 00:49.160
[door creaking]

00:55.430 --> 00:56.560
[gasps]

00:56.630 --> 00:58.500
Aah!

01:04.430 --> 01:08.360
[sawing]

02:14.230 --> 02:17.860
Any closer
and the image will distort.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.030
How is jack?

02:19.100 --> 02:20.730
He's real smart.
had us in tears.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.530
Great kid.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.060
Haley?

02:25.130 --> 02:28.500
To be honest, we're moving
them to a halfway house.

02:28.560 --> 02:31.330
I thought you had found
a permanent location.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.930
Haley made a number of
phone calls to her mother.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.430
It's all good,
but to be safe,

02:36.500 --> 02:37.660
We have to move them.

02:37.730 --> 02:40.330
Sam, thank you.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.500
I promise you,

02:41.560 --> 02:43.030
No harm will come to them.

02:43.100 --> 02:46.400
You just concentrate
on getting foyet.

02:55.100 --> 02:57.800
Happy birthday, buddy.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.130
[thunder]

03:08.530 --> 03:10.360
You got a second?

03:10.430 --> 03:12.130
Sure, what is it?

03:12.200 --> 03:13.800
A case just came in.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.760
I'll be right there.

03:15.830 --> 03:18.300
Actually,
i need to talk to you.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.530
It's on commack, long island.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.730
That's your home town.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.000
Yeah. and if it's ok,

03:23.060 --> 03:24.800
I'd rather stay behind.

03:24.860 --> 03:25.800
Why?

03:25.860 --> 03:26.900
It was a different life,

03:26.960 --> 03:28.630
One i left 30 years ago.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.060
I'm in no hurry
to go back.

03:31.130 --> 03:33.030
Well...

03:33.100 --> 03:35.060
Any other day,
i'd say stay,

03:35.130 --> 03:37.730
But i just became
aware of this.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.530
What have we got?

03:47.600 --> 03:50.230
Ben vanderwaal was killed
in commack, long island,

03:50.300 --> 03:51.930
Last night,
shot at close range,

03:52.000 --> 03:53.900
Once in the heart,
once in the head,

03:53.960 --> 03:55.460
.22 caliber shell.

03:55.530 --> 03:57.000
They found hair
and blood traces

03:57.060 --> 03:58.700
From ben vanderwaal's
wife heather.

03:58.760 --> 03:59.730
But not heather?

03:59.800 --> 04:01.430
No, she's still missing,
presumed dead.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.830
The caliber and placement
of the bullets

04:03.900 --> 04:05.500
Match that
of two previous victims.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.030
The first, rita haslat.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.230
8 months ago she went
missing from her home
in new jersey.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.630
4 weeks later, she was
found in a trash bin.

04:11.700 --> 04:15.330
She went from that to this
in under 3 weeks?

04:15.400 --> 04:17.130
She's totally emaciated.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.399
Ligature marks
on her wrists and ankles

04:18.459 --> 04:19.959
Indicate
she was constrained.

04:20.029 --> 04:22.360
One in the heart,
one in the head--
same as vanderwaal.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.630
Sounds more like
an execution.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.830
Then why cut off
vanderwaal's
hands postmortem?

04:25.900 --> 04:27.000
What about the third victim?

04:27.060 --> 04:28.660
Bill levington.

04:28.730 --> 04:31.060
His appearance
was certainly altered.

04:31.130 --> 04:33.700
His genitals were missing.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.760
Though the method
of mutilation is
different in each crime,

04:35.830 --> 04:39.030
Clearly there's a signature.
the question is, what?

04:39.100 --> 04:40.300
Wheels-up in 20 minutes.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.900
What's this?

04:41.960 --> 04:43.530
You told me you were cleared
to travel. you lied.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.460
Naughty boy.

04:44.530 --> 04:45.960
Uh, no, i didn't.

04:46.030 --> 04:48.560
I am a doctor, so technically,
i wasn't a lie.

04:48.630 --> 04:49.700
What was it, then?

04:49.760 --> 04:51.930
Um...second opinion.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.300
Hmm. you're my bitch now.

04:55.130 --> 04:56.900

Rossi: "justice without force
is powerless.

06:06.760 --> 06:10.500
Force without justice
is tyrannical."

06:10.560 --> 06:12.130
Blaise pascal.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.630
In the ben vanderwaal case,

06:15.700 --> 06:17.060
His hands were taken.

06:17.130 --> 06:19.930
Uh, bill levington,
his genitals.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.530
Only in the rita haslat case
she was starved and tortured,

06:23.600 --> 06:24.660
Then executed,

06:24.730 --> 06:26.400
And there's no sign of
postmortem mutilation.

06:26.460 --> 06:28.330
Why would he take
heather vanderwaal

06:28.400 --> 06:29.330
And not simply kill her?

06:29.400 --> 06:31.930
Maybe he hasn't
and she's still alive.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.400
The only thing concrete
is the m.o.,

06:33.460 --> 06:36.300
Which depicts an efficient
no-nonsense murderer.

06:36.360 --> 06:37.730
Well, then
we need to figure out

06:37.800 --> 06:39.460
What each act of mutilation
means to the unsub.

06:39.530 --> 06:41.300
Or to the victim.

06:42.230 --> 06:44.200
It's pretty much
how we found it.

06:44.260 --> 06:46.200
There's no signs
of forced entry.

06:46.260 --> 06:48.730
It says in the file
that heather vanderwaal
has a daughter.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.930
Where is she?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.360
She moved to san diego
to live with her real father.

06:52.430 --> 06:53.560
Ben and heather vanderwaal

06:53.630 --> 06:55.660
Have only been married
a couple of years.

06:55.730 --> 06:57.530
So heather came in,
she dropped her shopping bags,

06:57.600 --> 06:59.230
Her cell phone, and her keys,
but not her coat.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.260
She turns on the lights.

07:00.330 --> 07:01.730
But they didn't work,

07:01.800 --> 07:04.030
Because the phone and
the ectricity were cut.

07:04.100 --> 07:07.260
Something in this room
attracted her attention.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.230
What is it?

07:12.300 --> 07:14.900
Marks in the blood
look like a camera tripod.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.530
Serial killers,
especially sexual sadists,

07:16.600 --> 07:18.060
Often document their kill.

07:18.130 --> 07:21.030
But sexual sadists usually
torture their victims

07:21.100 --> 07:22.160
While they're still alive.

07:22.230 --> 07:23.730
You still didn't find
any conflicting dna?

07:23.800 --> 07:26.630
No. no prints,
no fibers, nothing.

07:26.700 --> 07:27.830
Nobody heard any shots?

07:27.900 --> 07:29.900
[cell phone rings]
no. oh, excuse me.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.600
Yeah?

07:32.800 --> 07:34.230
All right.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.060
Heather vanderwaal
was just found

07:36.130 --> 07:37.460
Wandering the streets
half hour ago.

07:37.530 --> 07:39.260
She's at brookside general.

07:39.330 --> 07:41.160
Get jj over there.

07:41.230 --> 07:44.030
A killer this sophisticated
doesn't leave a living witness

07:44.100 --> 07:45.530
Without a reason.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.430
Heather, my name is
agent jareau.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.800
I have some questions
for you.

07:54.830 --> 07:57.360
So you came home,

07:57.430 --> 07:59.130
You tried to turn
the lights on,

07:59.200 --> 08:00.600
But they didn't work.

08:00.660 --> 08:02.930
What did you do next?

08:08.760 --> 08:12.360
I saw a light.

08:12.430 --> 08:14.060
A flash.

08:14.130 --> 08:16.800
I opened the door,

08:16.860 --> 08:18.830
And ben was there,

08:18.900 --> 08:20.930
Tied to a chair.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.800
I think he was dead.

08:22.860 --> 08:25.060
There was another flash.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.260
It blinded me
for a moment.

08:27.330 --> 08:29.500
Did you see your attacker?

08:29.560 --> 08:30.560
No.

08:30.630 --> 08:32.130
Did he say anything?

08:32.200 --> 08:33.330
No.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.659
I heard this noise.

08:35.730 --> 08:37.429
What kind of noise?

08:39.929 --> 08:41.429
Sawing.

08:42.630 --> 08:46.860
I watched him cut off
ben's hand.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.000
Why didn't he kill me?

08:54.060 --> 08:57.230
[cell phone rings]

08:57.300 --> 08:59.030
Excuse me.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.860
[ring]

09:02.900 --> 09:04.200
Jj: garcia.

09:04.260 --> 09:05.800
We've been getting to know
heather vanderwaal.

09:05.860 --> 09:07.900
I can't tell you
her favorite beatle,

09:07.960 --> 09:10.830
<i>but i can tell you
she was living la vida unhappy.</i>

09:10.900 --> 09:11.930
What did you find?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.530
Reid: her ex-husband
took her daughter allison

09:13.600 --> 09:17.160
Out of school mid-term.
after that, heather cut
a check for $5,000

09:17.230 --> 09:19.630
To a place called
lewis, bell, & peters

09:19.700 --> 09:20.630
6 days ago.

09:20.700 --> 09:21.760
Law firm?

09:21.830 --> 09:22.760
Family law.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.560
Thanks.

09:29.230 --> 09:31.730
Mrs. vanderwaal...

09:31.800 --> 09:34.830
At mid-term you moved
your daughter out of school?

09:34.900 --> 09:37.030
Yes, i did.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.500
After that, you filed
for divorce from ben.

09:39.560 --> 09:43.900
This man left you alive
for a reason.

09:43.960 --> 09:47.030
I need to know if these
two things are connected.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.500
A few months ago,

09:50.560 --> 09:53.860
I found a picture of allison
on ben's phone.

09:53.930 --> 09:54.860
Your daughter.

09:54.930 --> 09:56.800
She was naked.

09:56.860 --> 09:59.030
Where was it taken?

09:59.100 --> 10:00.260
I couldn't tell.

10:00.330 --> 10:01.730
Did you confront him?

10:01.800 --> 10:03.400
Yes. he claimed that

10:03.460 --> 10:06.060
Allison sent it
to him by mistake.

10:06.130 --> 10:09.500
She meant to send it
to another student
at her school.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.530
It's called sexting.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.200
What did allison say?

10:13.260 --> 10:14.630
She said ben took it,

10:14.700 --> 10:17.660
But she--she lies.

10:17.730 --> 10:20.460
Allison, she's a liar.

10:20.530 --> 10:23.600
She caused us a lot
of trouble, you know?

10:23.660 --> 10:26.500
She wasn't lying about this,
though, was she?

10:30.660 --> 10:32.430
No.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.430
[crying]

10:39.500 --> 10:41.630
The hand removal
is less than surgical.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.860
He used a basic
double-toothed saw.

10:43.930 --> 10:45.730
So, the guy
we're looking for

10:45.800 --> 10:47.400
Has no medical
training.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.930
Not the kind i've had.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.630
One in the heart,
one in the brain, close range.

10:54.700 --> 10:57.500
The second one
was right up behind the ear.

10:57.560 --> 10:58.930
How about gunshot residue?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.330
Surprisingly little.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.060
Maybe it's because the killer
was using a .22.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.360
Small caliber, small discharge.

11:06.960 --> 11:07.900
Hmm.

11:07.960 --> 11:08.960
What is it?

11:09.030 --> 11:10.930
Ballistics can't match
the bullets to a gun.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.530
There were no rifling marks
on the bullet.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.400
There's only one
explanation for that.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.860
Well, if anyone had a motive
to kill ben vanderwaal,

11:17.930 --> 11:19.260
It was heather's ex-husband.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.600
But he was in san diego,
and he has no connection

11:21.660 --> 11:23.060
To the other two victims.

11:23.130 --> 11:25.160
David rossi,
we finally get to meet.

11:25.230 --> 11:27.660
Detective gil hardesty.
very, very nice
to have you with us.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.230
Hotch: morgan,
what did you find?

11:29.300 --> 11:32.500
In all cases,
the .22 caliber bullets
had no rifling marks.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.230
And without the barrel
being rifled,

11:34.300 --> 11:36.200
The bullets would have
very little velocity.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.960
He would have to shoot
his vi pointblank.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.330
Jj. this guy's using
a zip gun.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.900
Now, if you know
what you're doing,
a piece of plumbing

11:41.960 --> 11:43.960
Or a kid's bicycle pump
can be turned into a gun.

11:44.060 --> 11:45.560
Rossi: one in the heart,
one in the head.

11:45.630 --> 11:49.630
Untraceable, expandable
bullets tell me
without question,

11:49.700 --> 11:51.930
All of these kills
were strictly business.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.260
A hitman?

11:53.330 --> 11:54.960
What about the postmortem
mutilation?

11:55.030 --> 11:57.530
A contract sometimes
includes extras.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.400
The camera is not
for sexual gratification,
it's for proof of death.

12:00.460 --> 12:02.000
So we could be looking
for two people?

12:02.060 --> 12:03.900
Maybe. maybe more.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.330
Excuse me.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.560
I may be able to hit on
some old contacts,

12:07.630 --> 12:09.560
But i'll need to do it alone.

12:09.630 --> 12:10.830
Contacts?

12:10.900 --> 12:12.660
Do we want to know?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.630
Best not.

12:18.360 --> 12:21.030
[tv, indistinct]

12:24.660 --> 12:27.730
[irish accent]
we don't open till 5:30.

12:27.800 --> 12:32.030
I'm looking for the owner
of that coat.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.660
Is that right?

12:38.300 --> 12:39.700
Not with that you're not.

12:41.430 --> 12:43.760
Check out the front
and back.

12:43.830 --> 12:47.830
You're either a dead man
or a cop. which one is it?

12:48.860 --> 12:51.560
Right now i'm just
an old friend.

12:51.630 --> 12:55.300
You gave up that right
the day you became a fed.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.060
Ray?

13:02.060 --> 13:03.500
David.

13:12.300 --> 13:14.000
I thought you retired.

13:14.070 --> 13:16.370
Writing books?

13:16.440 --> 13:18.540
What can i tell you, ray?

13:18.600 --> 13:21.340
Some habits
are hard to break.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.040
I try this damn puzzle
every morning.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.800
Never gets any easier.

13:26.970 --> 13:28.500
"crater creator."

13:28.570 --> 13:29.900
You know,
i work with a kid

13:29.970 --> 13:31.900
Who can solve this whole
thing in 5 minutes.

13:31.970 --> 13:33.970
He must be smarter
than both of us.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.140
That's for sure.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.940
So what's it been,
30 years?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.070
33.

13:40.140 --> 13:41.670
You know, i thought
at the very least

13:41.740 --> 13:44.970
I would see you
at emma's funeral.

13:45.040 --> 13:48.200
I, um...
need to ask you a favor.

13:48.270 --> 13:51.370
She loved you
as much as you loved her.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.340
Hey, ambition's a bitch,
ain't it?

13:54.400 --> 13:56.140
I'm not here
to talk about emma.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.740
What are you here
to talk about?

13:57.800 --> 13:58.900
You've read the news?

13:58.970 --> 14:00.800
You think i got something
to do with that?

14:00.870 --> 14:02.870
You should
stick to writing books.

14:02.940 --> 14:05.470
This guy is real specific.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.840
He uses a zip gun
and then throws in extras.

14:07.900 --> 14:11.570
For a smart guy,
your coming back here
was a real dumb move.

14:11.640 --> 14:15.840
Not as dumb as the one
that sean made.

14:17.540 --> 14:20.070
He's on trial for
the transportation
of weapons,

14:20.140 --> 14:21.440
No doubt for you.

14:21.500 --> 14:24.400
And what about the rico beef
hanging over your head?

14:24.470 --> 14:26.140
You help me,

14:26.200 --> 14:29.140
And you'll be assisting
a federal investigation.

14:29.200 --> 14:32.170
[chuckles] and what exactly
is that gonna do
for my reputation?

14:32.240 --> 14:33.770
If you don't,

14:33.840 --> 14:36.300
You may not have one
to protect.

14:36.370 --> 14:38.400
Our organized crime unit
is very close

14:38.470 --> 14:41.500
To shutting you down
permanently.

14:42.670 --> 14:45.970
Keep talking.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.640
The removal of the hands
is as specific

14:48.700 --> 14:51.240
As rita haslat's condition
was when she was found.

14:51.300 --> 14:53.270
Just as specific as the removal
of bill levington's genitals.

14:53.340 --> 14:55.170
There's a message
in the mutilations

14:55.240 --> 14:56.500
The unsub
wants us to know.

14:56.570 --> 14:58.800
I got something here
that might help us with--

14:58.870 --> 15:00.800
Technically, we have
something here that
might help with that.

15:00.870 --> 15:02.770
Bill levington was involved
in a serial rape case,

15:02.840 --> 15:05.040
All involving minors,
and it never went to trial.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.040
Rita haslat?

15:06.100 --> 15:07.170
A former social worker,
a former--

15:07.240 --> 15:08.500
Attained said former
status

15:08.570 --> 15:10.800
When she was fired
from the dcfs for
gross negligence.

15:10.870 --> 15:13.640
In one of her cases,
a 7-year-old boy
starved to death.

15:13.700 --> 15:16.340
Prentiss: which explains
why haslat was so emaciated
when she was found.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.270
If all the victims
were indicated in crimes
against children,

15:18.340 --> 15:20.140
Then we've found
a connection.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.540
One of the unsubs has access
to the crimes of the victims

15:22.600 --> 15:24.870
And probably works
in the justice system. garcia?

15:24.940 --> 15:26.370
On it. what?
on it.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.200
All right, well,
we know what the victims
have in common,

15:28.270 --> 15:30.340
We just need to find out
who they have in common.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.200
Wait. this social worker
and the suspected rape case,

15:32.270 --> 15:33.640
Those were
matters of record.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.740
Ben vanderwaal's relationship
with his stepdaughter is not.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.570
Unless the stepdaughter
told someone else.

15:38.640 --> 15:39.740
I'll call rossi.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.370
I'll have the daughter
brought in.

15:44.440 --> 15:48.040
And all 3 crimes
were against children?

15:48.100 --> 15:51.270
Ok. thanks, prentiss.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.340
Cuban, no doubt.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.500
Mm.

15:55.570 --> 15:56.840
Contraband?

15:56.900 --> 16:00.340
Some laws
are just plain unjust.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.570
You know, those 3 individuals
messed with kids.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.840
They got what they deserve.

16:05.900 --> 16:09.900
That all depends on
your definition of justice.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.870
It's the same as when
we were kids.

16:11.940 --> 16:15.000
You do what you gotta do
to survive.

16:15.070 --> 16:17.200
What about this guy?

16:20.400 --> 16:21.740
Yeah.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.840
There's only one guy
that's this specific.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.570
Name?

16:28.600 --> 16:30.440
Bosola.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.370
I spoke to heather last night.

16:34.440 --> 16:38.000
I knew for a long time
something was off, but this--

16:38.070 --> 16:40.440
Why didn't you tell me?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.970
Mr. sandweiss,
allison is the victim here.

16:43.040 --> 16:46.440
I just want to know
the truth from her,
for once.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.900
I told you,
i don't know what
they're talking about.

16:48.970 --> 16:54.300
Allison, we have the pictures
your stepfather took of you.

16:54.370 --> 16:55.940
Sandweiss: allison...

16:58.640 --> 17:01.770
He was always home
before mom.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.400
We just talked
at first.

17:03.470 --> 17:04.869
Why didn't you
tell your mom?

17:04.940 --> 17:07.599
I knew she'd tell dad,
and he always said
he'd kill anyone

17:07.670 --> 17:09.470
Who laid a hand on me.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.470
And did he?

17:14.640 --> 17:16.770
How long has he
been operating?

17:16.839 --> 17:18.440
20 years.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.270
He's a ghost.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.000
I've heard that name.

17:22.069 --> 17:23.770
Bosola.

17:23.839 --> 17:27.170
He's a character in a play.

17:27.240 --> 17:30.740
<i>jacobean tragedy called
the duchess of malfi.</i>

17:30.800 --> 17:34.400
Bosola brutally slays
the duchess.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.870
It wouldn't be a tragedy
if he didn't.

17:36.940 --> 17:39.270
Is he local?

17:39.340 --> 17:43.040
I don't care
about the rico beef.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.070
What about sean?

17:51.440 --> 17:54.470
Federal prison, out in 2.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.240
All right.

17:59.470 --> 18:02.000
I'll bring you bosola
tonight.

18:02.070 --> 18:04.340
You better bring
the marine corps.

18:08.070 --> 18:09.670
Allison, did you ever
tell anyone

18:09.740 --> 18:13.300
About what your stepfather
was doing?

18:13.370 --> 18:15.800
I told my therapist.

18:15.870 --> 18:20.570
He said i act out
because i crave attention.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.240
I'm so sorry, daddy.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.740
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.800
We need his name,
please.

18:29.870 --> 18:31.400
Your therapist.

18:31.470 --> 18:33.970
Sandweiss: jerry sorum.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.640
Am i a suspect?

18:35.700 --> 18:37.500
Not yet, mr. sorum.

18:37.570 --> 18:39.800
What is your professional
opinion of allison?

18:39.870 --> 18:41.800
You mean was she
sexually abused
by her stepfather?

18:41.870 --> 18:42.900
No question.

18:42.970 --> 18:44.040
And you reported it.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.370
Of course.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.040
To the police?

18:47.100 --> 18:48.040
Absolutely.

18:48.100 --> 18:49.840
Morgan:
how far did they take it?

18:49.900 --> 18:51.370
They had it reviewed
by the state.

18:51.440 --> 18:53.200
Did the police interview her?

18:53.270 --> 18:54.370
They came to my office.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.970
Allison wanted
nothing to do with it.

18:56.040 --> 18:57.170
Case closed.

18:57.240 --> 19:00.040
Just like the 380,000 cases
of child abuse

19:00.100 --> 19:01.840
Reported in this country
each year.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.440
Less than one percent
gets to trial.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.770
Does that make you
want to even the odds?

19:10.370 --> 19:12.400
Every time i listen
to a child

19:12.470 --> 19:15.000
Vividly recount
the most horrific

19:15.070 --> 19:16.440
Acts of abuse

19:16.500 --> 19:18.900
Done at the hands
of a father,

19:18.970 --> 19:20.770
An uncle,

19:20.840 --> 19:23.570
Someone they're
supposed to trust...

19:23.640 --> 19:27.300
It's all i can do
not to break down.

19:27.370 --> 19:30.240
But that's all
i'm capable of.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.470
After that, like you,

19:32.540 --> 19:35.240
I trust in
the justice system.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.600
[cell phone rings]

19:40.670 --> 19:42.170
Rossi.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.870
Midnight. my restaurant.

19:43.940 --> 19:46.370
Most people
never meet bosola.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.640
Those that do
only ever meet him once.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.900
If he smells a fed,
i'm gonna end up
like the duchess.

19:51.970 --> 19:53.800
Now, that would be
a tragedy.

19:53.870 --> 19:56.040
[laughs]

19:58.600 --> 20:00.540
All right.

20:04.800 --> 20:08.800
I've never said anything
out of turn, ever, have i?

20:08.870 --> 20:10.440
Go on.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.400
Always you've treated me
like a son.

20:13.470 --> 20:17.370
But i'd rather do time
that see you become a rat
and help the feds.

20:17.440 --> 20:20.700
I'm closing the restaurant
tonight.

20:20.770 --> 20:23.400
You and the boys
take the night off.

20:23.470 --> 20:25.940
I can't let you do this
alone.

20:28.840 --> 20:31.470
I'm not helping the feds.

20:31.540 --> 20:33.670
I'm helping an old friend.

20:33.740 --> 20:37.700
Good night. go on.

20:42.970 --> 20:47.100
Rossi: he dims the lights,
we go in.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.870
So, uh, jack's what,
4 today?

20:49.940 --> 20:51.040
Yeah.

20:51.100 --> 20:53.500
And i literally have
no idea where he is.

20:53.570 --> 20:55.900
He's safe.

20:59.540 --> 21:01.970
I saw prentiss and morgan
up the block,

21:02.040 --> 21:03.770
But the two agents
in the sedan,

21:03.840 --> 21:05.200
They're not with us.

21:05.270 --> 21:07.840
That the counter surveillance
in case foyet is watching me.

21:07.900 --> 21:11.140
For which, apparently,
there's no more money.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.140
Yeah, i heard.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.600
Did somebody call you?

21:17.340 --> 21:19.800
They're concerned.

21:19.870 --> 21:21.940
What did you say?
what i'm telling you.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.770
An attack against you
is an attack against all of us.

21:24.840 --> 21:27.040
[cell phone rings]

21:27.100 --> 21:29.500
Why are you calling?
you ok?

21:29.570 --> 21:31.570
I hope you got
some good guys out there.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.770
This man is a mean
son of a bitch.

21:33.840 --> 21:36.070
We're all over.
he's not gonna know
what hit him.

21:36.140 --> 21:37.740
Hey, that kid--

21:37.800 --> 21:40.500
The, uh, smart one--

21:40.570 --> 21:42.340
I could use a little help.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.670
Reid?

21:43.740 --> 21:44.740
Reid here.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.000
Crossword question.

21:46.070 --> 21:47.400
10 letters.

21:47.470 --> 21:48.900
Crater creator.

21:48.970 --> 21:50.740
10 letters,

21:50.800 --> 21:54.400
Crater creator.

21:54.470 --> 21:56.340
Arctangent.

21:57.970 --> 21:59.200
Did you get that?

21:59.270 --> 22:01.470
Damn, she's smart.

22:01.540 --> 22:03.870
Mm-hmm.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.470
Did you see that--

22:14.540 --> 22:16.470
Flash?

22:19.800 --> 22:20.840
I saw that.

22:20.900 --> 22:21.940
He's already in there.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.370
All units, go, go, go!

23:03.880 --> 23:05.380
Morgan's out canvassing
the area.

23:05.440 --> 23:07.780
This whole place
is swarming with cops.

23:07.840 --> 23:11.010
We had the streets,
the building, even
the damn roof covered.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.510
How the hell
did he get through us?

23:12.580 --> 23:14.110
Garcia traced finnegan's
phone calls.

23:14.180 --> 23:17.440
He made one at 4:38
to a pre-paid cell,

23:17.510 --> 23:19.940
Another one to you at 11:41.

23:20.010 --> 23:22.080
We gave bosola 7 hours
to prepare.

23:22.140 --> 23:23.680
I think he was here
before we arrived.

23:23.740 --> 23:25.480
And he heard ray
call me.

23:25.540 --> 23:26.580
This is all my fault.

23:26.640 --> 23:27.880
Now he knows we're onto him.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.240
He's not the only one.

23:29.310 --> 23:33.140
Whoever he works for
does, too.

23:33.210 --> 23:35.780
Each mutilation
represents the crimes

23:35.840 --> 23:39.280
The unsubs believe
these 3 individuals committed.

23:39.340 --> 23:40.280
Unsubs?

23:40.340 --> 23:42.010
Unknown subjects. 2.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.440
Both male. unsub "a"
we're calling
the planner.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.740
He works in the criminal
justice system.

23:46.810 --> 23:49.580
We're looking at both
defense and prosecution
attorneys,

23:49.640 --> 23:51.140
Judges, and even cops.

23:51.210 --> 23:53.140
We believe that the planner
has experienced

23:53.210 --> 23:54.840
A devastating personal tragedy
of some sort.

23:54.910 --> 23:57.310
And because of
the sophisticated nature
of the scenario,

23:57.380 --> 24:00.010
We believe unsub "a"
is in his late 50s or 60s.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.410
The planner likely met
unsub "b", the enforcer,

24:02.480 --> 24:04.480
Within the court system.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.140
He's been hired
to carry out justice.

24:06.210 --> 24:08.480
Now, this type of justice
does not come cheap.

24:08.540 --> 24:12.640
So the planner has access
to substantial cash.

24:12.710 --> 24:14.610
Absolutely no attempt
was made

24:14.680 --> 24:16.080
To hide the mutilation.

24:16.140 --> 24:18.510
This suggests the planner
either doesn't care
what we find

24:18.580 --> 24:20.340
Or he wants us to find it.

24:20.410 --> 24:22.310
Now, the enforcer,
on the other hand,

24:22.380 --> 24:23.540
Has no such intentions.

24:23.610 --> 24:25.480
He should be considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

24:25.540 --> 24:26.780
Thank you.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.110
All right. let's go, people.

24:37.210 --> 24:39.680
All final payments
have been made.

24:39.740 --> 24:43.180
I see no reason
not to complete the tasks

24:43.240 --> 24:45.610
Or to converse further.

24:46.740 --> 24:49.780
Good. one last request--

24:49.840 --> 24:52.610
I would like you
to pay special attention

24:52.680 --> 24:55.080
To mr. patton.

25:11.910 --> 25:13.580
I've concentrated
on the last 3 cases.

25:13.640 --> 25:15.480
They've left
the freshest e-prints.

25:15.540 --> 25:16.480
Great.

25:16.540 --> 25:17.980
Not really.
over 100,000 cases

25:18.040 --> 25:19.610
Pass through
long island court.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.540
Who had eyes on those files?

25:21.610 --> 25:23.580
Literally hundreds
and hundreds of people.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.140
Change track.
focus on the enforcer.

25:25.210 --> 25:27.580
Mob-related murder
trials on long island
the last 10 years.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.140
We're looking for
a hitman.

25:29.210 --> 25:31.980
Hey, there are 93 mob trials
in the last 10 years.

25:32.040 --> 25:35.010
Put aside any trials that
resulted in a conviction.

25:35.080 --> 25:38.110
Weed out mistrials
and arraignments.

25:38.180 --> 25:39.240
Uh, 19.

25:39.310 --> 25:41.480
Were any of those on trial

25:41.540 --> 25:43.740
Suspected of being hitmen
or enforcers?

25:43.810 --> 25:44.880
Reid: 3--

25:44.940 --> 25:46.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
this totally slipped the net.

25:46.340 --> 25:49.340
Tony mecacci--his case
was judged a mistrial,

25:49.410 --> 25:51.710
But check out
his suspected victim.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.340
.22 caliber, right?

25:56.410 --> 25:57.410
Bull's-eye.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.010
Cross-match our profile
of the planner

25:59.080 --> 26:00.710
Against all those
connected with this trial.

26:00.780 --> 26:03.210
Let's see--prosecuting
lawyer garrett daniels,

26:03.280 --> 26:04.980
Judge boyd schuller,

26:05.040 --> 26:06.040
Criminal defense lawyer
paul--

26:06.110 --> 26:07.040
Wait, wait.

26:07.110 --> 26:09.580
Did you say judge schuller?

26:09.640 --> 26:11.940
Yeah, here's a photo.

26:12.010 --> 26:14.180
What's wrong?

26:15.240 --> 26:16.680
Prentiss:
do you know him?

26:16.740 --> 26:19.140
No. but i knew his wife.

26:19.210 --> 26:20.840
2 years ago she was
driving home from work

26:20.910 --> 26:22.480
And she was killed
by a drunk driver.

26:22.540 --> 26:23.710
That could be
the tragedy.

26:23.780 --> 26:25.680
She was the love
of his life,
that's for sure.

26:25.740 --> 26:28.010
12 months ago, judge schuller
took a leave of absence

26:28.080 --> 26:29.210
Due to health issues.

26:29.280 --> 26:30.980
He was diagnosed
with terminal cancer.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.080
He has 6 months to live.

26:32.140 --> 26:33.580
And that's when
the killing started.

26:33.640 --> 26:34.680
You don't seriously
think judge--

26:34.740 --> 26:36.840
Judge schuller
is the planner.

26:36.910 --> 26:38.780
Fits the profile.
yes, i do.

26:38.840 --> 26:42.680
And tony mecacci
is most likely
bosola the enforcer.

26:42.740 --> 26:44.140
What have you got
on bosola?

26:44.210 --> 26:46.210
Uh, he went off the grid
after his last trial.

26:46.280 --> 26:49.080
Jj, put out a statewide apb
and release mecacci's photo
to the media.

26:49.140 --> 26:51.210
Judge schuller's
a highly-respected man.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.880
We can't just walk in there
and accuse him
of serial murder.

26:53.940 --> 26:55.340
Then i'll go to
the attorney general

26:55.410 --> 26:59.110
And petition the chief justice
if i have to.

26:59.180 --> 27:01.010
And maybe not.

27:03.710 --> 27:06.680
I believe
you're looking for me.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.310
You know we have to
advise you of your rights.

27:19.380 --> 27:23.980
I waive my constitutional
rights against
self-incrimination.

27:24.040 --> 27:26.910
When you walked in here,

27:26.980 --> 27:28.910
You said, "i believe
you're looking for me."

27:28.980 --> 27:30.310
And i was right.

27:30.380 --> 27:33.510
Your timing was impeccable.

27:33.580 --> 27:35.310
But how could you
know that?

27:35.380 --> 27:38.280
I knew it wouldn't take
you long to find me.

27:38.340 --> 27:40.440
Not after what
i've left behind.

27:40.510 --> 27:42.580
So you don't deny
any of this?

27:42.640 --> 27:47.480
Why would i?
what you see as a crime,
i see as justice.

27:47.540 --> 27:49.840
Ray finnegan
was a friend of mine.

27:49.910 --> 27:51.780
Ray finnegan was a criminal.

27:51.840 --> 27:54.180
You should choose your friends
more wisely.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.510
It must have really
thrown you

27:57.580 --> 27:59.540
When ray showed up
at emma's funeral.

27:59.610 --> 28:02.680
How do you know
about my wife?

28:02.740 --> 28:06.640
You have absolutely no idea
who i am, do you?

28:08.580 --> 28:12.340
Ray told rossi
you only meet bosola once.

28:12.410 --> 28:14.840
So judge schuller
had to have given him
a list of names.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.510
He never needs
to see him again,

28:16.580 --> 28:18.440
Just make final payment
on proof of death.

28:18.510 --> 28:20.280
Have garcia hack into
schuller's files

28:20.340 --> 28:21.610
And track his financial records

28:21.710 --> 28:23.140
Before everything
gets shut down.

28:23.210 --> 28:24.940
And find out if his office
made any calls.

28:25.010 --> 28:27.140
They did. i spoke to them
a few hours ago.

28:27.210 --> 28:28.910
I told them we had
two suspects.

28:28.980 --> 28:30.310
So he knows we're onto him.

28:30.380 --> 28:32.310
He came here to stall.

28:32.380 --> 28:36.210
He does have a list.
there's more to come.

28:38.480 --> 28:41.740
Could we just get on
with what i came here for?

28:41.810 --> 28:43.780
Why? so bosola can go on
and carry on

28:43.840 --> 28:45.740
Whatever it is
you asked of him to do? no.

28:45.810 --> 28:48.080
You call him
and you end this.

28:48.140 --> 28:51.480
Even if i could,
i wouldn't.

28:51.540 --> 28:54.210
She was born
emma louise taylor,

28:54.280 --> 28:56.780
4th of july 1958.

28:56.840 --> 28:58.610
You could get that
from anywhere.

28:58.680 --> 29:01.180
When she was 6,
her dad john

29:01.240 --> 29:04.240
Brought him a black
and white homeless kitten.

29:06.010 --> 29:09.410
If she knew you...

29:09.480 --> 29:11.080
Emma would have told me.

29:11.140 --> 29:12.680
She named it oscar,

29:12.740 --> 29:14.510
After oscar wilde.

29:14.580 --> 29:17.840
And of all oscar wilde's
work, she loved

29:17.910 --> 29:21.410
<i>an ideal husband the most.</i>

29:22.840 --> 29:27.410
I don't know how you know
all of this about emma

29:27.480 --> 29:29.910
Or what you hope to achieve,

29:29.980 --> 29:31.310
But we're done.

29:31.380 --> 29:33.810
You know the charges.
charge me.

29:33.880 --> 29:37.240
Is that what started
all this insanity--

29:37.310 --> 29:38.640
Emma's death?

29:38.710 --> 29:42.680
What started all of this
was the 35 years

29:42.740 --> 29:44.310
I had to sit and watch

29:44.380 --> 29:47.180
As the system
i swore an oath to protect

29:47.240 --> 29:51.610
Failed the very people
our justice system
was meant to protect.

29:51.680 --> 29:54.280
I wonder what emma
would make of all this.

29:54.340 --> 29:57.040
Every single person
on that list deserves justice,

29:57.110 --> 29:59.840
And it's justice
they managed to evade.

29:59.910 --> 30:02.410
Morgan: so...

30:02.480 --> 30:04.810
You do have a list.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.410
I'm finished talking.

30:14.140 --> 30:15.840
Oh-oh, we've got gobs
of two-way traffic going on,

30:15.910 --> 30:17.540
Which means someone
is trying to bounce us out.

30:17.610 --> 30:19.510
Ok, bosola
didn't come cheap,

30:19.580 --> 30:21.180
So judge schuller
had to have made

30:21.240 --> 30:22.680
Some pretty substantial
transactions.

30:22.740 --> 30:24.240
Got wire transfers
to a cayman island bank

30:24.310 --> 30:25.810
And that's where
the trace ends.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.510
How many, how much?

30:27.580 --> 30:30.580
June, he debits numerations
of $9,999

30:30.640 --> 30:33.010
Every few days, total of 4,
he takes a break for a few weeks

30:33.080 --> 30:35.710
Until he makes
his final transaction
for the same magic number.

30:35.780 --> 30:38.580
Anything less than
$10,000 keeps the irs
off your trail.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.080
I know that, too.

30:40.140 --> 30:43.210
So, the final payment
must be for proof of death.

30:43.280 --> 30:45.780
That makes $50,000
the price of a kill.

30:45.840 --> 30:48.510
He did that 3 times
over a period of 12 months,

30:48.580 --> 30:49.840
But 2 days ago,

30:49.910 --> 30:52.310
He raided his account
for $100,000 all in one hit.

30:52.380 --> 30:53.480
He also closed
all his accounts

30:53.540 --> 30:54.810
And handed
his entire estate over

30:54.880 --> 30:56.280
To a victims support group.

30:57.540 --> 30:59.310
Someone who isn't suffering
from too many brainiacs

30:59.380 --> 31:00.810
In the high-tech kitchen
just bounced us out.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.780
Good job.

31:03.710 --> 31:05.040
If our calculations
are correct,

31:05.110 --> 31:06.880
There are 2 more names
on that list.

31:06.940 --> 31:08.910
There are.

31:08.980 --> 31:11.610
Every single person
on that list deserves
justice.

31:11.680 --> 31:12.840
He said deserves,
not deserved.

31:12.910 --> 31:14.110
Now look.

31:14.180 --> 31:16.040
Right there. he looked at
his watch for the second time.

31:16.110 --> 31:19.640
Whatever he's waiting for
is about to happen.

31:26.220 --> 31:28.250
I don't think
you knew emma at all.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.790
At least not the one
i knew.

31:29.850 --> 31:33.420
I made an excuse
for myself

31:33.490 --> 31:35.650
That i wouldn't be
welcome at her funeral.

31:35.720 --> 31:39.350
But the truth is,
i couldn't face it.

31:40.290 --> 31:42.650
You knowing emma
changes nothing.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.020
Oh, but it does.

31:44.090 --> 31:47.190
Emma changed the lives
of everyone she knew.

31:47.250 --> 31:50.020
But at least ray and i
saw her death

31:50.090 --> 31:51.850
For what it truly was--

31:51.920 --> 31:54.190
A tragic accident.

31:54.250 --> 31:56.520
Dan patton was drunk.

31:56.590 --> 32:00.320
He murdered emma, as surely
as if he put a gun to her head.

32:00.390 --> 32:02.950
Is that why
his photo's not here?

32:03.020 --> 32:04.690
You're saving the best
for last?

32:04.750 --> 32:07.450
We need to locate
dan patton now.

32:07.520 --> 32:11.420
The 100,000 must be
for some serious extras.

32:27.550 --> 32:30.020
How many other people
have you targeted?

32:30.090 --> 32:32.720
I want the truth.

32:32.790 --> 32:34.390
I have nothing more to say.

32:34.450 --> 32:36.720
Oh, but i do.

32:36.790 --> 32:38.290
I ran into emma,
by chance,

32:38.350 --> 32:39.720
A few years ago,

32:39.790 --> 32:41.290
At a hotel
in manhattan.

32:41.350 --> 32:44.320
I was working
on a case, so was she.

32:44.390 --> 32:47.050
I knew she was married.

32:47.120 --> 32:49.520
But i didn't care.

32:52.350 --> 32:54.250
She...

32:54.320 --> 32:56.990
She wouldn't.

32:57.050 --> 32:58.090
No.

32:58.150 --> 33:01.690
Emma would not do that
to me.

33:01.750 --> 33:03.350
You're lying.

33:03.420 --> 33:04.790
Emma...

33:07.920 --> 33:09.890
I want the truth.

33:09.950 --> 33:11.650
You first.

33:13.150 --> 33:15.720
Dan patton is the last one.

33:15.790 --> 33:18.190
There are no more.

33:18.250 --> 33:20.620
Now, tell me the truth.

33:21.590 --> 33:24.290
That night in manhattan,

33:24.350 --> 33:28.420
She told me our connection
was so strong,

33:28.490 --> 33:32.520
It could never happen
only once.

33:34.820 --> 33:37.890
And i was fine with that.

33:49.490 --> 33:51.520
[door closes]

33:56.620 --> 34:00.350
[car alarm]

34:04.950 --> 34:06.650
[alarm chirps off]

34:10.550 --> 34:14.250
Please. please don't.
i have nothing,
no money, nothing.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.090
Nothing--uhh! ohh!

34:16.150 --> 34:18.520
[gasping]

34:18.590 --> 34:20.650
Please,
please don't kill me.

34:20.719 --> 34:21.920
This isn't about money.

34:21.989 --> 34:23.989
This is about the murder
of emma schuller.

34:24.050 --> 34:26.120
Emma? oh, god.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.420
Emma--that was--
that was an accident.

34:27.489 --> 34:28.790
Please. no, that
was an accident.

34:28.850 --> 34:30.989
Please--please don't--

34:33.989 --> 34:36.590
At least...

34:36.650 --> 34:41.290
You now know what kind of man
you're working with.

34:41.350 --> 34:42.650
What kind of man
are you, judge?

34:42.719 --> 34:45.320
I've had enough
of seeing the guilty

34:45.389 --> 34:47.489
Walk free of their sins.

34:49.219 --> 34:52.020
But what about your sins?

34:53.550 --> 34:58.050
I got cancer for mine.

34:58.120 --> 35:00.390
Maybe he's still at work.

35:00.450 --> 35:03.220
Workplace said he left
for the day.

35:10.490 --> 35:14.220
[knocks] dan patton,
this is the fbi.

35:22.550 --> 35:25.190
Prentiss: clear!

35:29.620 --> 35:32.450
One to the heart,
one to the head.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.520
We know who did it.

35:34.590 --> 35:37.790
Bosola has no way
of getting off long island.

35:37.850 --> 35:38.950
They're moving judge schuller.

35:39.020 --> 35:39.850
What?

35:39.920 --> 35:40.950
He's a high court judge.

35:41.020 --> 35:42.190
It makes it a federal case now.

35:42.250 --> 35:43.590
What if bosola
has no intention

35:43.650 --> 35:44.920
Of leaving the island?

35:44.990 --> 35:48.090
Garcia said the judge
was giving his whole
estate away?

35:48.150 --> 35:49.490
His property, his money.

35:49.550 --> 35:51.250
He closed out his accounts
and paid off his utility bills.

35:51.320 --> 35:53.750
He has cancer, but he still
has 6 months to live.

35:53.820 --> 35:56.250
Is there a reason
he's paying off
all his bills now?

35:56.320 --> 35:58.920
Not to mention
the 100,000 he made

35:58.990 --> 36:03.390
As a last and final payment
for not one, but 2 kills.

36:03.450 --> 36:05.090
Usually the judge waits
for confirmation of death

36:05.150 --> 36:06.750
Before making final payment.

36:06.820 --> 36:10.090
Only this time he knew
he wouldn't be around
to see it.

36:10.150 --> 36:11.920
Here he comes!

36:11.990 --> 36:13.050
Oh, there he is.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.050
Judge schuller!

36:14.120 --> 36:15.320
Judge schuller is helping us

36:15.390 --> 36:16.790
With a federal
investigation.

36:16.850 --> 36:18.390
Wait a minute. what?
i can't hear you. speak up.

36:18.450 --> 36:19.850
Judge schuller, does this
have anything to do with

36:19.920 --> 36:21.290
The recent
rash of murders?

36:21.350 --> 36:23.220
I am of the belief
that justice has been served.

36:23.290 --> 36:24.920
Morgan: hotch,
wait a minute. what?

36:24.990 --> 36:26.050
[reporters
all talking at once]

36:26.120 --> 36:27.090
No comment.

36:27.150 --> 36:28.120
Judge schuller,
can you confirm reports...

36:28.190 --> 36:29.950
I lied.

36:30.020 --> 36:30.950
What?

36:31.020 --> 36:32.450
...your status
in this case?

36:36.890 --> 36:38.250
[gunshot, screaming]

36:38.320 --> 36:40.090
Everybody down!
get on the ground!

36:40.150 --> 36:42.250
Down on the ground!
stay down!

36:42.320 --> 36:44.490
[screaming and shouting]
get down!

38:09.050 --> 38:11.190
She was special to you.

38:14.050 --> 38:16.520
I was just thinking...

38:16.590 --> 38:18.020
When i first met emma,

38:18.090 --> 38:21.490
I knew i would love her
for the rest of my life.

38:21.550 --> 38:24.120
We were 12 years old.

38:25.050 --> 38:26.820
She always said
we were doomed

38:26.890 --> 38:29.690
To be star-crossed lovers,

38:29.750 --> 38:31.850
Destined to wonder

38:31.920 --> 38:34.450
What might have been.

38:37.090 --> 38:40.620
I never slept with her,
you know.

38:40.690 --> 38:42.590
That wasn't true

38:42.650 --> 38:44.520
What i said to schuller.

38:44.590 --> 38:46.950
That was just to
get under his skin,

38:47.020 --> 38:48.920
Knock him off his game.

38:48.990 --> 38:51.790
I understand.

38:51.850 --> 38:55.820
I should have
married her, though.

38:57.850 --> 39:01.290
When i left the marines,

39:01.350 --> 39:03.820
I was recruited
by the bureau,

39:03.890 --> 39:05.590
Spent a few years
on the streets,

39:05.650 --> 39:08.650
Got involved with
starting the bau.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.850
And before i knew it,

39:10.920 --> 39:13.790
A lifetime had gone by.

39:13.850 --> 39:16.620
I hear you.

39:16.690 --> 39:20.150
I missed a life with emma

39:20.220 --> 39:25.650
Because i became obsessed
with the chase.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.390
With the hunt.

39:27.450 --> 39:29.820
Dave, he's threatening
my family.

39:29.890 --> 39:32.850
And we'll get foyet, aaron.

39:32.920 --> 39:35.250
Then what's your point?

39:38.750 --> 39:41.620
You have a family.

39:42.790 --> 39:45.050
When all this is over,

39:45.120 --> 39:47.790
What are you gonna do...

39:47.850 --> 39:50.850
To make sure
you're not a lonely guy

39:50.920 --> 39:57.250
Wondering why you let
the purest thing
in your life...

39:57.320 --> 39:59.050
Get away?

40:08.590 --> 40:10.090
[car alarm chirps]

40:16.690 --> 40:18.850
Going somewhere?

40:18.920 --> 40:21.920
Hear the joke
about the two irishmen--

40:26.950 --> 40:29.050
[groaning]

40:30.790 --> 40:32.620
Yeah, i heard it.

40:32.690 --> 40:34.890
Didn't find it funny
the first time.

40:34.950 --> 40:36.620
Rossi: "i have always found

40:36.690 --> 40:40.590
That mercy bears richer fruit
than strict justice."

40:40.650 --> 40:42.450
Abraham lincoln.
