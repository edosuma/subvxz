He headed up a leading
arbitrage company.

I think I'm hearing you say
he had a long list of enemies.

It shouldn't matter what
people thought of Mark.

Business acumen and arrogance
shouldn't get you killed!

11:12.040 --> 11:14.241
It shouldn't, but it might have.

11:14.276 --> 11:16.777
We need a list of anyone you
think might be responsible.

Yes.
He was shot at close range.

11:46.374 --> 11:47.875
The bullet's still lodged in the skull.

11:47.909 --> 11:49.343
How did Frankie do at the scene?

11:49.377 --> 11:53.347
Good. Very composed.
But he had a good teacher.

Oh, I need Frost's magic fingers.

12:01.223 --> 12:03.190

of a university are so intense

12:26.381 --> 12:28.449

Seems so surprising that even

- Why is that surprising?
- I just can't understand

a finger to help him.

But the truth is, I'll never
not be Paddy Doyle's daughter.

I just want to know where he came from.

Korsak said the wife and sister
gave you a list of enemies.

lost a squash match,

- No idea.

That's why they were setting

I'm Dr. Maura Isles.

you're, uh, Paddy's daughter

- You don't got a choice.
- This is just temporary. As I told you,

you'll be in assisted living
in just a few days, Mr. Doyle.

22:48.136 --> 22:50.070
And as I told you,
take me back to my cell,

22:50.138 --> 22:51.839

Professor Rhonda Clark
had a stellar reputation.

- Any of her students stand out?
- Yeah, this one. Peter Kaufman.

25:34.452 --> 25:37.854
He was actually Rick's student,
but it was up to Rhonda to decide

25:37.889 --> 25:40.323
whether to let Peter
into their PHD program.

25:40.391 --> 25:41.758
- And?
- And according to the dean,

25:41.792 --> 25:45.395
Rhonda washed him out.
Peter didn't take it well.

25:45.429 --> 25:47.631
She recorded his final
oral presentation.

25:48.381 --> 25:51.721
- Ah.
- If this has anything to do with

or where to hide the good silver,

25:54.705 --> 25:58.975
- I'm trying to catch up.
- It's about dog hair.

25:59.043 --> 26:01.912
- Oh! Did you find the breed?
- Yes. It's a German shepherd.

26:01.979 --> 26:04.748
High levels of dander, which
explains the mucosal edema

26:04.749 --> 26:08.752
- I found in the lung tissue samples.
- She was allergic? But she had a dog.

26:08.786 --> 26:10.453
Merton was labradoodle. No dander.

26:10.488 --> 26:11.888
But if she had a histamine reaction,

26:11.923 --> 26:13.757
doesn't that mean that
she inhaled the hair?

26:13.791 --> 26:16.393
- Yes.
- And since she was still breathing,

26:16.427 --> 26:17.928
the hair wasn't in the water.

26:17.962 --> 26:19.896
It means the hair could
have been on the killer.

26:19.931 --> 26:21.698
Maybe the killer had a German shepherd.

26:21.732 --> 26:23.900
The root ball's still intact.
I could test the dog hair.

26:23.935 --> 26:25.468

was on any medication.

26:25.536 --> 26:28.571

other than some forgotten mobster.

32:27.183 --> 32:30.681
Now eat your damn breakfast
and thank Maura for her trouble!

32:32.322 --> 32:35.991
Patrick Jr. was my only son.

32:36.059 --> 32:38.074
I was all he needed...

32:38.328 --> 32:42.498
Until that ... that woman,
that ... that Hope, came along

32:42.532 --> 32:44.867
and ... and changed things,
turned him away from me.

32:44.901 --> 32:46.735
Yeah, well, that isn't Maura's fault.

32:46.770 --> 32:48.904
It's her fault I'm gonna die out here.

32:48.939 --> 32:52.141
Paddy asked her... to take you!

32:53.619 --> 32:57.777
He what? But...

32:57.812 --> 33:02.865
Yeah. He's punishing me.

33:04.955 --> 33:08.457
I wanted to stay where I was. I...

33:08.491 --> 33:11.460
I-I told him, I...

33:13.964 --> 33:17.933
He put me outside...

33:17.968 --> 33:20.903
because...

33:20.937 --> 33:25.174
he wants to see me die...

33:25.241 --> 33:27.142
as a nobody.

33:27.829 --> 33:30.579
Maybe he put you out
here so you could see

33:30.613 --> 33:34.183
the one good thing he's done ...

33:34.217 --> 33:35.284
Maura.

33:39.022 --> 33:40.956
[ printer whirs ]

33:43.226 --> 33:47.930
- Bruno. He looks nice.
- Mm, yes, he does.

33:47.964 --> 33:50.442
Did you just make an online-dating
love connection? 

33:50.520 --> 33:53.302
<i>Funny. I'm pulling up all the
registered German shepherds.</i>

33:53.370 --> 33:55.204
I always wanted one ... the
good ones are direct and honest,

33:55.238 --> 33:59.174
- but not hostile, like you.
- [ chuckles ] Thank you.

33:59.242 --> 34:01.477
I'm sorry I made a joke.
Is that my tell?

34:01.511 --> 34:04.146
- Your what?
- What tell?

34:04.180 --> 34:07.335
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

34:07.550 --> 34:09.351
Is this a trick question?

34:09.386 --> 34:11.520
I'm so thankful that some of
the people I work with are guys.

34:11.554 --> 34:14.089
No! Let's talk dogs, Korsak.

34:14.123 --> 34:16.257
For a guy running a
billion-dollar company,

34:16.292 --> 34:18.994
this Mark Cabot sure had
a lot of time to go to the gym.

34:19.029 --> 34:20.918
You still thinking he was
killed by another member? 

34:20.967 --> 34:23.966
Maybe. He was there every day
and on every tournament team.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.400
I asked myself the same question,

34:25.435 --> 34:27.101
so I looked through
the company's minutes.

34:27.137 --> 34:29.471
Mark was never there.
Guy was a slacker.

34:29.505 --> 34:31.639
Well, maybe somebody on
the board wanted him out.

34:31.674 --> 34:33.976
His wife and sister
were on the board, right?

34:34.010 --> 34:35.643
Yeah, but they both have solid alibis.

34:35.678 --> 34:38.414
And Mark gave everyone motive.

34:38.447 --> 34:40.416
<i>He controlled everything,
made all the big decisions,</i>

34:40.449 --> 34:42.985
- took all the credit.
- I found six German shepherds

34:43.018 --> 34:44.553
that live within 10
blocks of Rhonda's house.

34:44.587 --> 34:47.556
<i>Jane, there's a dog
park near Rhonda's house.</i>

34:47.590 --> 34:51.126
<i>Dogs need special tags to use it.
I'm pulling up all the German shepherds.</i>

34:51.161 --> 34:55.230
Wait a minute. Your VET has
to sign off on the forms.

34:55.264 --> 34:58.333
I bet we can find out
if any of those dogs

34:58.368 --> 35:00.335
were on that drug that
we found in the dog hair.

35:00.370 --> 35:03.305
<i>- Korsak: Look at that name ...
- "Jaco" the German shepherd.</i>

35:03.373 --> 35:05.507
Owner is Leslie Cabot.

35:05.575 --> 35:08.911
What the hell?
Leslie Cabot is our victim's sister.

35:12.082 --> 35:13.549
It's here in the dog's records.

35:13.616 --> 35:16.585
Leslie Cabot's German
shepherd was on carprofen.

35:16.619 --> 35:20.189
I don't get it. These two
victims were strangers.

35:20.223 --> 35:24.660
So why is his sister's
dog's hair in her lungs?

35:24.694 --> 35:26.328
The murders are connected.

35:26.362 --> 35:28.297
- Ever see "Strangers on a train"?
- Frost: Hitchcock.

35:28.331 --> 35:29.932
Two strangers each want someone dead.

35:29.966 --> 35:33.824
- They agree to do it for each other.
- The perfect murders.

35:40.377 --> 35:43.111
You can't set up a perfect
murder in today's world

35:43.145 --> 35:44.612
without talking to each other.

35:44.647 --> 35:46.981
<i>We can connect them through
e-mails or texts or phone calls.</i>

35:47.016 --> 35:49.350
You can check, but I doubt
you can find anything.

35:49.385 --> 35:52.253
Remember what Rick said to us...
"big brother's watching"?

35:52.288 --> 35:54.656
He made sure that we
couldn't make a link

35:54.690 --> 35:56.560
- between him and Leslie Cabot.
- How?

35:59.261 --> 36:01.963
Frost, check to see if
Rick's dog is registered

36:01.997 --> 36:04.265
- at Leslie's dog park.
- That's it, Jane.

36:05.668 --> 36:09.504
Yeah. Both Merton and Jaco
have dog tags and used the park.

36:09.571 --> 36:12.240
That's where they met. That's
where they planned the murders.

36:12.308 --> 36:14.008
And they probably agreed
never to contact each other

36:14.043 --> 36:15.109
unless it was at that dog park.

36:15.144 --> 36:16.611
- Smart.
- Very.

36:16.645 --> 36:18.579
All right, let's talk motive.

36:18.614 --> 36:21.349
- Why would Leslie want her brother dead?
- Frost: She got fed up with doing all the work 

36:21.383 --> 36:23.718
- while he took the credit?
- Wait, wait. I found this in the minutes.

36:23.752 --> 36:25.586
<i>It was the one meeting Mark attended.</i>

36:25.654 --> 36:29.190
Last week, he had a secret
vote to remove a board member.

36:29.224 --> 36:32.126
Who was the board member?
Who wasn't at that meeting?

36:32.161 --> 36:34.429
Leslie Cabot.

36:34.463 --> 36:36.664
You think Leslie figured out
that Mark was getting rid of her?

36:36.699 --> 36:37.908
What about Rick Clark?

36:38.003 --> 36:40.335
You think he wanted Rhonda
dead because she let herself go?

36:40.369 --> 36:43.438
Frost, can you do a search?

36:43.472 --> 36:45.606
See if this graduate student plagiarized

36:45.641 --> 36:48.176
- the material on this drive.
- Sure.

36:49.545 --> 36:51.713
What do all university Professors want?

36:51.747 --> 36:53.748
- Tenure.
- That's right.

36:53.816 --> 36:56.985
- She got it. He didn't.
- You think that's the motive? Jealousy?

36:57.019 --> 36:58.987
Okay, this is odd. There it is.

36:59.021 --> 37:02.123
The material on this drive was
published in a sociology journal.

37:02.157 --> 37:05.560
So, Peter's thesis was
published a week after

37:05.594 --> 37:07.628
she kicked him out of the program?

37:07.696 --> 37:10.264
Oh, look who claims he wrote it ...
Rick Clark.

37:10.299 --> 37:12.367
That's why Rhonda thought
Peter plagiarized it ...

37:12.401 --> 37:14.135
She probably read Rick's
article before it was published.

37:14.169 --> 37:18.606
Well, tenure is all about publication.
So, Rick must have felt the pressure,

37:18.674 --> 37:22.043
which means he was competing with
his wife for the same tenure slot.

37:22.077 --> 37:24.345
I'll call the dean and find out.

37:24.380 --> 37:26.414
Yeah, but we still don't
have enough to arrest them.

37:26.448 --> 37:28.069
- Why not?
- We don't have any evidence

37:28.070 --> 37:29.150
to connect them to the victims.

37:29.184 --> 37:32.253
<i>Yeah, were there other contenders
in line for that tenure slot?</i>

37:32.287 --> 37:36.424
Yes. Yes. 
All right, thank you.

37:36.458 --> 37:38.659
You were right ... Rick and
Rhonda Clark were in line

37:38.694 --> 37:42.130
- for the same tenure spot.
- Now that she's dead, it's his, isn't it?

37:42.164 --> 37:43.564
The dean's gonna announce it today.

37:43.599 --> 37:47.468
That's motive ... that and the
fact that they "grew apart."

37:47.536 --> 37:49.637
There has to be a way to get them, Jane.

37:50.350 --> 37:52.673
Wait, there is.

<i>Uh, we believe that it's your wife's
killer, but we can't identify her.</i>

Yes, identify her.

38:17.813 --> 38:19.883

You know, you're not supposed to
use your personal car for work.

38:22.404 --> 38:24.238
It's new, and I like it,

38:24.306 --> 38:27.708

in a police car? - No.

- Hey, Casey, you want to see a movie later?
- Sure.

38:30.179 --> 38:33.381

- I'm looking up movie listings.

<i>Stay close, Casey. Company.</i>

- Hey.
- Jane: That's not Leslie Cabot.

38:40.689 --> 38:43.291
That's Jenny Cabot ... Mark's wife.

He's not barking.

38:46.228 --> 38:48.529
<i>Look at that ... those dogs are friends.</i>

38:48.597 --> 38:51.265

If I'm going down, you're
going down, too. [ scoffs ]

How could you not know
your neighbor had a camera

39:04.613 --> 39:07.386
<i>- Aimed at your damn house?
- Would you relax, okay? It'll be fine.</i>

39:07.421 --> 39:09.931
<i>Yeah, fine for you, you'll be.
I made sure there were no cameras.</i>

39:09.966 --> 39:10.852
<i>Hell, I even got you the gun.</i>

39:10.919 --> 39:14.622
Which is where? 
Your house? Your car?

39:14.656 --> 39:16.624
- Dumbass.
- In the ocean.

39:16.658 --> 39:20.528
Oh. What about you, huh?
Did you tell your girlfriend

39:20.596 --> 39:21.796
you weren't just taking
her dog for a walk, huh?

39:21.864 --> 39:24.732
You think Leslie maybe ought to know
that you had her brother killed

39:24.800 --> 39:26.868
- so that she could save her job.
- Don't you dare.

39:26.902 --> 39:28.669
Looks like Jenny married
the wrong sibling.

39:28.704 --> 39:31.439
<i>Wonder if Mark knows his wife was
having an affair with his sister.</i>

39:31.473 --> 39:35.243
<i>- Let's go.
- All right.</i>

39:35.277 --> 39:38.312
<i>Unless, of course, you want me sending
an anonymous letter to your dean.</i>

39:38.347 --> 39:40.882
<i>At least, I didn't have my wife
killed so I could take her job.</i>

39:40.916 --> 39:44.218
- I hated my wife.
- Yeah, well, I hated my husb...

39:44.253 --> 39:45.887

Funnily enough, that remains
the number-one motive for murder.

<i>We have some good
news and some bad news.</i>

39:50.222 --> 39:51.359
The good news is ...

39:51.393 --> 39:55.396
we don't have you on security
cameras, Jenny. The bad news ...

39:55.430 --> 39:58.833
you see that dog over
there with her collar?

39:58.867 --> 40:00.334
That's a parabolic mike,

- Why?

40:25.727 --> 40:29.263
Because it's the right thing to do.

40:29.331 --> 40:31.799
Because you're a lonely,
angry, old gangster.

40:31.867 --> 40:34.569
But you're also my grandfather,
and you don't have anybody else,

40:34.636 --> 40:36.504

40:38.874 --> 40:44.245
You ... you look just
like Paddy right now.

40:44.313 --> 40:48.616
Maybe there is something
to this biology thing.

40:52.287 --> 40:55.656
So, blood is thicker than water.

40:55.691 --> 40:58.793
The density of blood plasma
in circulating blood cells

40:58.827 --> 41:00.995
