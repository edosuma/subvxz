WEBVTT

00:01.056 --> 00:03.033
Previously on Royal Pains...

00:03.052 --> 00:06.254
It won't be long before I have
to worry about baby proofing.

00:06.422 --> 00:08.823
- [Baby crying]
- Sorry, Jeremiah!

00:08.891 --> 00:10.358
[Screams]

00:10.426 --> 00:12.594
So this place is quiet in the afternoon?

00:12.661 --> 00:14.162
Yeah, between 3:00 and 5:00 P.M.,

00:14.230 --> 00:16.297
it's a total graveyard.

00:19.489 --> 00:21.356
Who were you looking for
today in Shadow Pond?

00:21.424 --> 00:24.293
- I was looking for my father.
- Well, who is your father?

00:24.360 --> 00:26.061
What I'm about to say is gonna sound crazy,

00:26.129 --> 00:27.596
and there's really no way to couch it...

00:27.664 --> 00:30.299
- Already bored.
- We have a sister.

00:30.366 --> 00:32.500
No offense or anything, but
you just kind of showed up

00:32.569 --> 00:34.603
out of nowhere, so why
should we believe you?

00:34.671 --> 00:36.038
I have DNA proof.

00:36.105 --> 00:38.774
We haven't been introduced.
Eddie R. Lawson...

00:38.842 --> 00:41.910
I'm Hank and Evan's dad.

00:41.978 --> 00:44.613
I'm Emma...

00:44.681 --> 00:46.215
Your daughter.

00:51.554 --> 00:53.288
Pop?

00:53.356 --> 00:56.825
Emma?

00:56.993 --> 00:58.393
I don't hear any screaming.

00:58.461 --> 01:01.697
Yeah. I don't hear anything.

01:01.764 --> 01:04.166
Dad?

01:04.233 --> 01:07.970
Oh.

01:08.037 --> 01:11.073
Pops...

01:11.140 --> 01:14.776
Did you not hear...

01:14.844 --> 01:16.044
Pops?

01:23.586 --> 01:25.587
You all right?

01:25.655 --> 01:27.255
Dad...

01:27.323 --> 01:30.892
Did you and Emma have a
chance to talk it through?

01:37.066 --> 01:41.036
I would like you boys to hear it from me.

01:41.104 --> 01:44.639
Okay, so this whole thing
started about a month ago.

01:44.707 --> 01:45.807
I was in Missouri.

01:45.875 --> 01:47.109
I was on the book tour,

01:47.176 --> 01:51.613
and out of the blue,
Meredith sends me a text.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.993 --> 02:06.461
Meredith, it's me again.

02:06.529 --> 02:09.497
I-I-I've been here for about an hour.

02:09.565 --> 02:11.366
I've got to go. I've got a book signing.

02:11.434 --> 02:13.001
I-I don't know what happened.

02:13.069 --> 02:14.302
I hope you're okay,

02:14.370 --> 02:18.540
and I hope you've changed as much as I have.

02:18.608 --> 02:20.409
Okay, bye.

02:20.476 --> 02:22.511
Meredith was never gonna meet me.

02:22.578 --> 02:24.980
She didn't even know I was in town.

02:25.048 --> 02:27.682
- More coffee, sir?
- Uh, no.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.818
- Just the check.
- Okay.

02:29.886 --> 02:33.021
Thank you.

02:33.089 --> 02:36.391
It turns out that Emma was
the one who sent me the text.

02:36.459 --> 02:37.826
She knew I was in town

02:37.894 --> 02:41.029
and wanted to confirm that I was her father.

02:49.238 --> 02:51.440
Okay, so she collected some DNA.

02:51.507 --> 02:52.808
She stole his saliva.

02:52.875 --> 02:54.209
Okay.

02:54.277 --> 02:55.544
Dad, where is Emma?

02:55.611 --> 02:57.813
That's a whole other story.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.414
What is this?

02:59.482 --> 03:02.851
It's proof that you're my father.

03:02.919 --> 03:04.453
Let me get this straight.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.855
You traveled halfway across the country

03:06.923 --> 03:08.790
in order to give me two pieces of paper?

03:08.858 --> 03:10.358
Those aren't just two pieces of paper.

03:10.426 --> 03:12.961
Those are the lab results
from a genetic test.

03:13.029 --> 03:15.330
I mean, don't worry. I don't
want anything from you.

03:15.398 --> 03:17.699
I just came here because I
wanted you to see for yourself

03:17.767 --> 03:20.202
that I am doing just fine.

03:20.269 --> 03:23.505
I have a job. I have my own apartment.

03:23.573 --> 03:27.709
And guess what? I did
all of that without you.

03:33.149 --> 03:35.484
You don't believe me.

03:37.220 --> 03:38.653
You know what?

03:38.721 --> 03:41.756
Of course you don't believe me
because you are a deadbeat dad.

03:41.824 --> 03:44.126
You abandoned me then.
Why not abandon me now?

03:44.193 --> 03:45.794
Abandoned you?

03:45.862 --> 03:48.864
I didn't even know you existed!

03:50.233 --> 03:52.200
And let me tell you
something else, young lady...

03:52.268 --> 03:54.703
I am not a deadbeat dad!

03:54.770 --> 03:59.441
So, dad, technically, you
could be Emma's father.

03:59.509 --> 04:02.477
Technically, the report says

04:02.545 --> 04:07.516
there is a 99.99% probability of inclusion.

04:09.318 --> 04:11.620
But I am telling you now...

04:11.687 --> 04:15.423
I did not know about Emma until tonight.

04:15.491 --> 04:16.791
I knew nothing.

04:16.858 --> 04:19.327
I believe you, dad.

04:19.394 --> 04:20.428
I do.

04:20.495 --> 04:23.298
So do I.

04:23.366 --> 04:25.000
Boys...

04:25.067 --> 04:28.069
I handled this horribly.

04:28.137 --> 04:30.839
I mean, I just couldn't bear the idea

04:30.907 --> 04:34.709
that I abandoned a third child
when they were growing up.

04:34.777 --> 04:37.312
I mean, what kind of man does that?

04:37.380 --> 04:40.182
And then Emma...

04:40.249 --> 04:43.185
She travels all this way, and what do I do?

04:43.252 --> 04:45.520
I doubt her.

04:45.588 --> 04:48.857
No wonder she never wants to see me again.

04:51.527 --> 04:54.896
I am a deadbeat dad.

05:13.286 --> 05:15.287
Here's where we keep the extra bottles,

05:15.355 --> 05:17.087
- pacifiers, and teethers.
- Yes, I know.

05:17.287 --> 05:19.976
And the bib and burp
cloths are stored beneath

05:20.032 --> 05:21.458
- the sterilizer.
- Yes, I know.

05:21.595 --> 05:23.796
Now, uh, the bottle warmers...
The bottle warmers are...

05:23.864 --> 05:26.466
One here in the kitchen and
the other in the nursery.

05:26.533 --> 05:28.434
I remember from our practice rounds.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.637
Right.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.941
I'm stalling, aren't I? I'm sorry.

05:35.009 --> 05:36.976
It's my first day back at work full-time,

05:37.044 --> 05:39.112
and I'm a bit nervous.

05:39.179 --> 05:40.813
Of course you're nervous.

05:40.881 --> 05:43.082
You don't want to leave your baby.

05:43.150 --> 05:46.152
If you like, I can make
sure Sashi naps early.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.320
That way, she's wide awake

05:47.388 --> 05:48.788
and ready to play when you come home.

05:48.856 --> 05:51.124
[Chokes, coughs]

05:51.191 --> 05:52.525
Jeremiah...

05:52.593 --> 05:54.093
You remember Tilda.

05:54.161 --> 05:55.895
Yes, the new nanny. Hello.

05:55.963 --> 05:58.698
Good morning, Dr. Sacani.
It's nice to see you again.

05:58.766 --> 06:01.265
If you and Ms. Katdare know
what you'd like for dinner tonight,

06:01.332 --> 06:03.534
- I can go ahead and make someth...
- Oh, no, nothing for me.

06:03.601 --> 06:05.235
I could be busy, and there might be traffic,

06:05.303 --> 06:08.438
uh, but thank you. Good-bye.

06:08.506 --> 06:12.776
Okay, good-bye. See you tonight.

06:12.844 --> 06:16.079
Well, I should...
I should probably leave too.

06:16.147 --> 06:19.116
[Chuckles]

06:28.226 --> 06:30.961
[Sighs]

06:31.029 --> 06:32.696
Come on.

06:32.764 --> 06:35.132
Yay!

06:37.035 --> 06:39.970
- There you go.
- Thank you.

06:40.038 --> 06:41.905
Okay.

06:46.407 --> 06:47.674
Hey, Boris, just following up.

06:47.742 --> 06:49.376
I assume you still want me in Monte Carlo

06:49.443 --> 06:50.710
for the next phase of the trial

06:50.778 --> 06:52.646
and that you will let me know if you don't.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.615
Thank you. Bye.

06:55.683 --> 06:58.652
- Yep.
- Oh, nice.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.587
No, no, no, no. That... that's for dad.

07:00.655 --> 07:02.188
I came over to make him breakfast.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.423
Yeah, no, you're right.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.325
Dad will definitely eat
all two dozen muffins.

07:05.393 --> 07:07.427
- Well, he's gonna...
- Mmm.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.828
That is good.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.298
I'm glad you like it. That's mine. That's...

07:11.365 --> 07:13.700
There's a lot of muffins, Evan.

07:13.768 --> 07:16.136
What can I say? I worry, I bake.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.605
- How is he?
- He's still sleeping, I hope.

07:18.673 --> 07:20.373
He was up most of the night pacing.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.943
Well, I can't really blame him.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.077
This is a mess.

07:24.145 --> 07:25.278
Look, I'm worried too,

07:25.346 --> 07:26.813
but right now we need
to just stay out of it.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.448
What do you mean, stay out of it?

07:28.516 --> 07:29.816
He's devastated.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.685
W-we have to do something.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.386
That something is nothing.

07:33.454 --> 07:36.289
We need to give Emma the
time and space to cool down.

07:36.357 --> 07:37.590
It's what I do with you.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.393
Okay, look, I may have
mixed feelings about her,

07:40.461 --> 07:43.363
but Paige reminded me
who I am in this family.

07:43.431 --> 07:45.732
- Who are you?
- I'm the bridge-builder.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.801
You're an accountant, not an engineer.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.069
No, between people.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.638
I-I-I help people. I helped you and dad.

07:51.706 --> 07:53.139
Technically, you went behind my back,

07:53.207 --> 07:55.442
allowed dad to take our money,
and almost ruined our business.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.243
Wow. You're still holding on to that, huh?

07:57.311 --> 07:59.079
Okay, you know what? I have
a busy day ahead of me.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.413
You know how I feel. [Sighs]

08:00.481 --> 08:01.948
Just promise me this:

08:02.016 --> 08:03.950
For Emma's sake, you won't
let dad do anything stupid?

08:04.018 --> 08:07.153
Promise me.

08:07.221 --> 08:09.055
- I promise you.
- Thank you.

08:12.712 --> 08:15.547
[Sighs]

08:19.986 --> 08:21.586
- Hello!
- That's not funny.

08:21.654 --> 08:23.522
[Laughs] What are you doing?

08:23.589 --> 08:24.756
I thought you were sleeping.

08:24.824 --> 08:27.626
Well, I was taking a walk, thinking.

08:27.693 --> 08:29.761
And successfully knocking over milk bottles

08:29.829 --> 08:30.996
at a carnival, I see.

08:31.063 --> 08:33.398
- It's for Emma.
- Oh.

08:33.466 --> 08:35.600
Dad, you can't give that to Emma.

08:35.668 --> 08:36.768
She's a grown woman.

08:36.836 --> 08:38.770
Yeah, one who grew up without a father.

08:38.837 --> 08:41.039
Do you remember when I bought
you and Hank some bears?

08:41.107 --> 08:42.741
You loved it. What did you call yours?

08:42.808 --> 08:44.009
Pookie.

08:44.076 --> 08:45.777
Right, and you slept with it every night.

08:45.845 --> 08:46.878
Till he got completely worn out

08:46.946 --> 08:48.246
and we couldn't stitch him up anymore.

08:48.314 --> 08:50.382
So you put him in the trash
with crumpled crackers.

08:50.449 --> 08:52.050
Yeah, I didn't want him to go hungry.

08:52.118 --> 08:53.585
Well, now Emma's got a Pookie too.

08:53.653 --> 08:55.754
Right. Well, my bear was Pookie.

08:55.821 --> 08:58.023
The only thing in the world
better than one Pookie

08:58.090 --> 08:59.858
is two Pookies.

08:59.926 --> 09:02.561
Would you drive me to Emma's motel?

09:02.628 --> 09:04.729
You... uh, yeah.

09:04.797 --> 09:06.064
Uh, I made all these muffins, dad.

09:06.132 --> 09:08.900
- No time.
- Right.

09:08.968 --> 09:10.769
Good morning, Evan.

09:19.122 --> 09:22.224
What happened?

09:22.292 --> 09:25.628
How'd it go?

09:25.695 --> 09:28.163
Pookie is dead.

09:30.667 --> 09:32.368
I'm sorry, dad.

09:32.435 --> 09:35.371
[Sighs]

09:43.780 --> 09:45.981
So did she say where we were meeting her?

09:46.049 --> 09:47.182
Yes, in her office.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.784
- Hank?
- Oh, hey, Padma.

09:48.852 --> 09:50.286
Hey, Hank. Great to see you.

09:50.353 --> 09:51.754
Yeah, it's great to see you too.

09:51.821 --> 09:53.722
This is my P.A., Divya Katdare...

09:53.790 --> 09:55.424
Uh, we've met, actually.

09:55.492 --> 09:58.360
Oh, ri... of course you have,
'cause you guys... the...

09:58.428 --> 10:00.963
Oh, because we're both Indian women?

10:01.031 --> 10:03.032
Really, Hank? That's so inappropriate.

10:03.099 --> 10:04.600
- Completely inappropriate.
- No, no, no, no.

10:04.668 --> 10:05.901
No, I didn't... I didn't mean that.

10:05.969 --> 10:07.770
I mea... I just meant that
maybe at some point you...

10:07.837 --> 10:09.705
Actually, we do know each other.

10:09.773 --> 10:11.907
[Laughs] Our families have
been friends for years.

10:11.975 --> 10:14.510
- Oh, okay, then...
- [Laughs] I love doing that.

10:14.577 --> 10:16.979
- People turn all kinds of red.
- You guys are really funny.

10:17.047 --> 10:18.647
You're a great sport, Hank.

10:18.715 --> 10:19.982
- Thank you.
- [Laughs]

10:20.050 --> 10:21.083
Sorry. I got to run.

10:21.151 --> 10:22.818
I don't want to be late for my lesson.

10:22.886 --> 10:24.320
- Good to see you, Padma.
- You too.

10:24.387 --> 10:25.821
Bye, guys. Bye.

10:25.889 --> 10:28.521
- All right, let's go.
- You're a good sport, Hank.

10:28.563 --> 10:29.382
Well, thank you.

10:29.382 --> 10:30.125
Yes, but it was still inappropriate.

10:30.193 --> 10:31.360
Okay, I... How inappropriate?

10:31.428 --> 10:33.329
I mean... well, on a scale of one to ten?

10:33.396 --> 10:35.364
You haven't even spoken
to Emma since last night?

10:35.432 --> 10:36.699
- No.
- Oh.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.500
It's a tough situation
and not just for Emma,

10:38.568 --> 10:39.568
for my dad too.

10:39.636 --> 10:41.303
I completely understand.

10:41.371 --> 10:44.273
I'm missing Sashi, and
it's only been a few hours.

10:44.341 --> 10:47.076
I can't even begin to
imagine missing 18 years.

10:47.143 --> 10:48.844
Listen, if you want to
run home at any point,

10:48.912 --> 10:50.079
you just say the word.

10:50.146 --> 10:52.548
- Thank you.
- Okay.

10:52.615 --> 10:54.483
Annie, you here?

10:54.551 --> 10:56.452
Come in.

10:56.519 --> 10:58.387
[Gasps] Hi, Divya. You must be Hank.

10:58.455 --> 10:59.955
- I am. Nice to meet you.
- You too.

11:00.023 --> 11:01.423
I'm just gonna jump
right in, if that's okay.

11:01.491 --> 11:02.791
Oh, okay.

11:02.859 --> 11:04.960
I've been nauseous and
vomiting and really exhausted,

11:05.028 --> 11:06.962
and I'm not pregnant, so I
don't know what's going on.

11:07.030 --> 11:08.330
Well, sounds like it could be the flu.

11:08.398 --> 11:10.733
- I'll get your vitals.
- We can also do a nasal swab.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.368
Great, and if we could do
that all at the same time,

11:12.435 --> 11:13.435
even better.

11:13.503 --> 11:14.803
I don't mean to rush you, but...

11:14.871 --> 11:16.138
No, it's okay. We can see you're swamped.

11:16.206 --> 11:17.506
I am an ex-smoker.

11:17.574 --> 11:19.875
I have no tonsils, and
I don't take any drugs,

11:19.943 --> 11:22.678
and I drink a lot of coffee...

11:22.746 --> 11:23.746
Thank you.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.080
[Clears throat]

11:25.148 --> 11:26.815
I have one glass of
Chardonnay every single day,

11:26.883 --> 11:28.150
and I have a clam allergy.

11:28.218 --> 11:29.585
Anything more science-y than that

11:29.652 --> 11:30.986
you'll have to get it
from my medical records,

11:31.054 --> 11:32.621
which I'll have forwarded to your office.

11:32.689 --> 11:35.090
Uh, thank you. Are you taking
any over-the-counter meds?

11:35.158 --> 11:37.326
- Shh, shh, shh.
- I came to my office early.

11:37.394 --> 11:39.728
- Now, let me see what I can move.
- And we're done.

11:39.796 --> 11:41.030
Pack it all up. Let's go.

11:41.097 --> 11:42.731
Oh. Wait. I'm sorry. This isn't your office?

11:42.799 --> 11:44.933
- No. Let's go.
- Okay.

11:45.001 --> 11:46.602
- Here we are... no, no!
- Oh.

11:46.669 --> 11:48.604
- Not that door. Back door.
- Okay. All right.

11:48.671 --> 11:50.272
And we're going out the back door.

11:50.340 --> 11:52.841
Here we go. Here we go. What is happening?

11:58.348 --> 11:59.615
- Come on.
- Okay.

11:59.682 --> 12:01.250
[Grunts] Okay, coming.

12:01.317 --> 12:04.086
- What...
- Come on. Hurry up.

12:04.154 --> 12:05.687
Okay. Okay.

12:05.755 --> 12:07.790
- I'll be in touch.
- Great.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.525
Bye.

12:09.592 --> 12:10.926
What... what was that?

12:10.994 --> 12:13.295
Well, that was a private
investigator at work.

12:13.363 --> 12:15.097
- What?
- I told you.

12:15.165 --> 12:16.298
I met Annie when I hired her

12:16.366 --> 12:17.800
to do a background check on my nanny.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.302
- Uh, no, actually, you didn't.
- Oh, sorry.

12:20.370 --> 12:21.770
I guess mommy brain?

12:21.838 --> 12:24.239
[Laughs] Are you saying you
knew we'd be trespassing?

12:24.307 --> 12:25.307
Of course not.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.842
I-I assumed that she had permission.

12:26.910 --> 12:28.544
- Well, she didn't.
- Fore!

12:28.611 --> 12:30.646
[Grunts] Okay, come on. Not a good spot.

12:35.685 --> 12:39.154
Emma, sweetie...

12:39.222 --> 12:43.258
Thank you so much for
giving me a second chance.

12:43.326 --> 12:45.761
I'm so sorry that I wasn't there for you

12:45.829 --> 12:49.832
when you were growing up,
but I'm gonna make it up to you.

12:49.899 --> 12:52.434
By giving me a giant bear?

12:52.502 --> 12:55.504
You thought that would
somehow make me say, "yippie!

12:55.572 --> 12:58.974
Now I'm not mad about
you missing my childhood."

12:59.042 --> 13:01.777
Do you think that's what Emma felt?

13:01.845 --> 13:03.245
We don't know how she feels.

13:03.313 --> 13:04.947
That's why we're doing
this role-playing, dad,

13:05.014 --> 13:06.348
you know, to prepare you.

13:06.416 --> 13:07.583
It's good. You're doing great.

13:07.650 --> 13:09.151
This is great.

13:09.219 --> 13:12.121
You ready? You want to go back into it?

13:12.188 --> 13:14.957
Okay.

13:15.024 --> 13:18.460
You know, Pookie was only an icebreaker,

13:18.528 --> 13:19.962
because I can't fix the past.

13:20.029 --> 13:23.699
All I can do is be here for
you now, which I will be.

13:23.766 --> 13:25.901
I will not walk out on you.

13:25.969 --> 13:27.136
That's great.

13:27.203 --> 13:28.303
Aren't you walking out

13:28.371 --> 13:30.739
to go on another book tour in two days?

13:30.807 --> 13:33.442
- Uh...
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

13:33.510 --> 13:35.010
It's okay. Just take your time.

13:35.078 --> 13:36.311
You know what? Take a deep breath.

13:36.379 --> 13:37.779
[Inhales deeply] Go easy on him.

13:37.847 --> 13:39.515
- He's not as smart as you.
- Oh.

13:39.582 --> 13:40.916
Good, good, good. You better?

13:40.984 --> 13:43.352
Maybe I should just
concentrate on the present,

13:43.419 --> 13:45.420
but then I-I can't deny the past

13:45.488 --> 13:48.090
because that would be insensitive.

13:48.158 --> 13:50.526
Hey, kids, this is too stressful.

13:50.593 --> 13:51.727
I am stressing out.

13:51.794 --> 13:53.262
You know what? Let's take a little break.

13:53.329 --> 13:54.763
- Yeah. Let's take a break.
- Let's take a quick break.

13:54.831 --> 13:56.265
Paige, can I-I talk to you for a second?

13:56.332 --> 13:57.566
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

13:57.634 --> 13:58.934
You're doing great. We'll be right back.

13:59.002 --> 14:01.770
- I'll be right here.
- Good game.

14:01.838 --> 14:03.438
[Sighs] We're upsetting him.

14:03.506 --> 14:04.673
He's upset.

14:04.741 --> 14:06.909
I think Hank is right.
I should stay out of it.

14:06.976 --> 14:09.144
What? No, no, no, no,
you cannot back out now,

14:09.212 --> 14:11.647
not when you're this
close to building that bridge.

14:11.714 --> 14:15.617
- Yeah, about that bridge...
- What's the problem?

14:15.685 --> 14:17.953
There are no problems.

14:18.021 --> 14:19.855
I was a little annoyed when he insisted

14:19.923 --> 14:21.590
on naming her bear Pookie...

14:21.658 --> 14:23.792
A bear which, by the way,
was two feet taller

14:23.860 --> 14:25.794
than the one he gave me, but whatever.

14:25.862 --> 14:27.396
You're jealous of Emma.

14:27.463 --> 14:29.131
That's crazy. What?

14:29.199 --> 14:31.967
You want to stay the baby in the family,

14:32.035 --> 14:35.470
but, Evan, babe, if you build this bridge,

14:35.538 --> 14:38.874
not only will you be the
most awesome brother ever,

14:38.942 --> 14:42.544
you will also be the son who
reunited a father and daughter.

14:42.612 --> 14:44.146
I got it!

14:44.214 --> 14:46.081
I got it. I know what to do.

14:46.149 --> 14:48.584
Okay, I'm going to invite Emma

14:48.651 --> 14:50.185
to come with me on the book tour.

14:50.253 --> 14:52.454
That way, she gets to see
this beautiful country.

14:52.522 --> 14:53.755
She'll get to know me.

14:53.823 --> 14:55.324
I'll get to know her.

14:55.391 --> 14:58.894
It'll be a crash course in
father-daughter bonding.

14:58.962 --> 15:01.230
That is a wonderful offer,

15:01.297 --> 15:03.732
and I think Emma will definitely go for it.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.802
Well, she would go for
it if she would hear it.

15:06.869 --> 15:08.604
I'm afraid the next time I see her,

15:08.671 --> 15:12.441
she's gonna throw me in the hot tub.

15:12.508 --> 15:14.409
- Dad?
- Hmm?

15:14.477 --> 15:17.679
Leave it to us.

15:17.747 --> 15:20.115
110 over 70...

15:20.183 --> 15:22.351
Martin, your blood pressure's perfect.

15:25.955 --> 15:28.457
[Chuckles] No lollipop?

15:28.524 --> 15:31.026
Oh.

15:31.094 --> 15:32.861
- No, sorry.
- Great.

15:35.698 --> 15:38.200
Boys, you're next.

15:38.268 --> 15:40.202
[Cell phone chimes]

15:41.804 --> 15:44.006
Boys, you're next!

15:44.073 --> 15:47.776
It's time. Divya's ready for you.

15:47.844 --> 15:49.478
[Sighs]

15:49.545 --> 15:51.280
Thank you again for coming
on such short notice.

15:51.347 --> 15:53.115
It's our first summer here,

15:53.182 --> 15:55.684
and I've just been
scrambling since we arrived.

15:55.752 --> 15:57.552
Well, it's nice for me to meet another mum.

15:57.620 --> 15:58.987
Oh, you have kids?

15:59.055 --> 16:01.590
Yes, I have a daughter, Sashi.

16:01.658 --> 16:04.860
Uh, this is her five minutes ago.

16:04.927 --> 16:06.028
My nanny sent it.

16:06.095 --> 16:08.063
- Well, that was thoughtful.
- Mm-hmm.

16:08.131 --> 16:09.931
Oh, your baby is adorable.

16:09.999 --> 16:12.434
Does it look like she has a rash?

16:12.502 --> 16:14.703
What is that? Not an
instagram filter on that?

16:14.771 --> 16:16.238
I can't tell.

16:16.306 --> 16:17.739
Judd, Nelson,

16:17.807 --> 16:19.341
stop fighting.

16:19.409 --> 16:21.943
It is time for your camp physicals.

16:22.011 --> 16:23.779
We hate camp.

16:23.846 --> 16:25.547
Yeah, we're not going to camp.

16:25.615 --> 16:27.215
Yes, you are!

16:27.283 --> 16:29.451
Or mommy's gonna have a nervous breakdown.

16:29.519 --> 16:31.386
[Chuckles]

16:31.454 --> 16:32.988
- Leave that alone!
- Boys!

16:33.056 --> 16:34.589
Leave the experiment alone.

16:34.657 --> 16:36.792
Larkin's crazy for science.

16:36.859 --> 16:38.093
Well, that's great.

16:38.161 --> 16:39.728
Yeah, if you have everything she needs.

16:39.796 --> 16:43.398
Like, this morning, it was just
an empty plastic soda bottle,

16:43.466 --> 16:45.233
some toilet bowl cleaner, and aluminum foil.

16:45.301 --> 16:46.735
Hmm.

16:46.803 --> 16:48.737
Stop! Give it back to me!

16:48.805 --> 16:51.907
Boys! Stop torturing your sister!

16:51.974 --> 16:53.375
So is that bottle filled

16:53.443 --> 16:55.610
with the aluminum foil and
the, uh, toilet bowl cleaner?

16:55.678 --> 16:57.813
- I don't know. Probably.
- Put the bottle down now!

16:57.880 --> 16:58.814
It could... [Explosion]

17:08.580 --> 17:10.781
All right, you kids are free to go.

17:10.849 --> 17:11.883
Thank you to Divya.

17:11.951 --> 17:14.085
All: Thank you to Divya.

17:16.756 --> 17:20.125
And thank you for letting
my nanny bring Sashi over.

17:20.193 --> 17:22.560
I feel so much better about
going to my next appointment.

17:22.627 --> 17:24.663
Like I'd notice one more kid in this house.

17:24.730 --> 17:26.064
Hi, Ms. Katdare!

17:26.132 --> 17:27.898
- Hey, Tilda!
- Oh.

17:27.967 --> 17:29.367
[Chuckles]

17:29.435 --> 17:33.305
I remember my first child
and my first day away from him.

17:33.372 --> 17:35.273
Oh, the guilt was overwhelming.

17:35.341 --> 17:36.508
I was miserable.

17:36.576 --> 17:38.577
I feel like I've been split in two now,

17:38.644 --> 17:40.412
with the one half of me wanting my baby

17:40.479 --> 17:42.547
and the other half wanting to be at work.

17:42.615 --> 17:44.783
Please tell me that it will get easier.

17:44.850 --> 17:46.918
It will get different.

17:46.986 --> 17:48.587
Being a mom is a...

17:48.654 --> 17:50.255
It's a permanent state of pins and needles.

17:50.323 --> 17:52.023
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:52.091 --> 17:53.491
I got your text. Is everything okay?

17:53.559 --> 17:55.260
[Gasps] Yes.

17:55.328 --> 17:58.530
In one of the photos,
it looked like she's getting a rash.

17:58.598 --> 17:59.931
Are you worried about allergies?

17:59.999 --> 18:03.668
I was, but Sashi's fine. Although, clearly,

18:03.736 --> 18:07.172
I am suffering from separation anxiety.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.574
Tilda, I'm so sorry to have made
you rush over here for nothing.

18:09.642 --> 18:11.810
Part of my job is to ease your mind.

18:11.877 --> 18:13.011
Why don't you just relax?

18:13.079 --> 18:14.980
Just come inside whenever you're ready.

18:15.047 --> 18:16.448
Okay. Hi.

18:16.515 --> 18:19.517
- Can I get you some iced tea?
- Hi, yes. That's my nose.

18:19.585 --> 18:20.430
Yes.

18:26.792 --> 18:30.028
You think she's after their saliva too?

18:30.096 --> 18:31.263
Uh...

18:31.330 --> 18:33.965
I think they're probably after hers.

18:35.868 --> 18:37.469
Uh, how much can I bet?

18:37.536 --> 18:39.304
It's no-limit, so you can
bet anything you want,

18:39.372 --> 18:41.640
- but I would probably...
- Hey, guys.

18:41.707 --> 18:43.241
How's it going over here?

18:43.309 --> 18:47.112
Hey, do you want to learn how
to play Texas Hold'em with me?

18:47.179 --> 18:48.780
No. No.

18:48.848 --> 18:52.083
We don't want anyone
holding anything, actually.

18:52.151 --> 18:53.618
This is my sister.

18:53.686 --> 18:55.153
Yeah.

18:55.221 --> 18:59.024
So why don't you guys take a walk...

18:59.091 --> 19:02.294
- Right now?
- It's cool.

19:02.361 --> 19:03.461
See you tonight, Emma.

19:03.529 --> 19:05.530
- Oh, I ca...
- What's tonight?

19:05.598 --> 19:07.432
Some parties. I can't. I have to work.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.833
Sorry.

19:08.901 --> 19:11.503
Yeah, she has to work.

19:11.570 --> 19:14.773
She has to work all week, actually, so...

19:14.840 --> 19:16.941
That's enough, big brother.

19:21.580 --> 19:25.517
- If you're here to defend...
- Look, he's a good man, Emma.

19:25.584 --> 19:27.352
He has a really big heart.

19:27.420 --> 19:29.054
It's almost as big

19:29.121 --> 19:31.690
as that ridiculous pink bear he gave you.

19:31.757 --> 19:36.361
He's handled this situation
really badly so far, but...

19:36.429 --> 19:39.497
He wants to make it up to you.

19:39.565 --> 19:40.865
I hope you'll let him.

19:40.933 --> 19:42.634
<i>We</i> hope you'll let him, right?

19:42.702 --> 19:45.036
Emma, he really didn't know about you.

19:45.104 --> 19:47.872
I know.

19:47.940 --> 19:49.607
I called my mom last night,

19:49.675 --> 19:52.377
and when I told her that I had met Eddie,

19:52.445 --> 19:56.514
she admitted that he never knew about me.

19:56.582 --> 19:59.217
I'm really sorry.

19:59.285 --> 20:03.655
I know what it's like to, um,
have a complicated mother.

20:03.723 --> 20:07.225
You know, none of this
turned out like I expected.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.361
But now that you know the truth about him,

20:09.428 --> 20:11.738
I'm sure you must have questions?

20:11.738 --> 20:14.740
So why not hear him out
and just get some answers?

20:15.206 --> 20:16.622
Two brothers are enough.

20:16.659 --> 20:17.793
I am done.

20:17.861 --> 20:20.696
[Cell phone ringing]

20:20.764 --> 20:23.599
Oh, I'm so sorry. I-I have to take this.

20:23.667 --> 20:24.600
It's Russel.

20:24.668 --> 20:25.768
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:25.835 --> 20:28.037
Hi. How are you? Are you still in the city?

20:31.941 --> 20:34.543
Emma, can I ask you something?

20:38.481 --> 20:40.883
[Indistinct chatter]

20:43.620 --> 20:46.288
Psst.

20:46.356 --> 20:48.490
- Annie?
- Don't say my name.

20:48.558 --> 20:50.092
I didn't recognize you with the whole...

20:50.160 --> 20:52.394
That's the point. Sit down.

20:52.462 --> 20:54.096
Oh, what's it... Oh, we're on a stakeout?

20:54.164 --> 20:56.231
- Yes.
- Okay.

20:56.299 --> 20:57.666
Is that the guy from the golf club?

20:57.734 --> 20:58.867
- Don't point.
- Right.

20:58.935 --> 21:01.737
Arnold Pritchard, yes.
He's not with his wife.

21:01.805 --> 21:04.039
I'm trying to document
his extramarital affair.

21:04.107 --> 21:06.442
He's supposed to be at a
"board meeting" right now.

21:06.509 --> 21:08.410
Later on, he'll go to a
"doctor's appointment."

21:08.478 --> 21:10.379
After that, he'll go see
his "elderly father."

21:10.447 --> 21:11.814
Well, I guess the good news is

21:11.881 --> 21:13.382
you'll have plenty of time
to search his office again.

21:13.450 --> 21:14.717
- Should we reschedule?
- No.

21:14.784 --> 21:16.018
I'm so sorry,

21:16.086 --> 21:17.720
and I really owe you an
apology for the other day.

21:17.787 --> 21:19.755
I never meant to meet you there. [Sighs]

21:19.823 --> 21:21.223
It's just that when Divya called

21:21.291 --> 21:23.058
and said you had a last-minute cancellation,

21:23.126 --> 21:24.660
I-I just couldn't say no.

21:24.728 --> 21:26.962
Yeah, I'm sure you also didn't
expect Mr. Pritchard to return.

21:27.030 --> 21:28.564
Oops.

21:28.632 --> 21:30.166
This job's just really important.

21:30.233 --> 21:31.967
All right, apology accepted.

21:32.035 --> 21:34.069
In fact, I'm hoping you can help me.

21:34.137 --> 21:35.070
Oh, I'm listening.

21:35.138 --> 21:36.372
Yeah, a few days ago,

21:36.439 --> 21:38.240
I found out I have an
18-year-old half sister.

21:38.308 --> 21:40.009
Her name is Emma Miller.

21:40.076 --> 21:41.844
- She's from Missouri.
- Let me guess...

21:41.912 --> 21:43.345
she just showed up out of the blue.

21:43.413 --> 21:45.614
Yeah, she did, and she
keeps changing her story.

21:45.682 --> 21:47.016
I can run a background check.

21:47.083 --> 21:48.517
If you wouldn't mind, that would be great.

21:48.585 --> 21:49.818
It's no problem...

21:49.886 --> 21:52.154
Unlike my nausea, which
has gotten so much worse,

21:52.222 --> 21:55.090
and now I have this strange pain right...

21:55.158 --> 21:58.360
- Okay, do you feel feverish?
- I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

21:58.428 --> 22:00.095
Is it some kind of a super bug?

22:00.163 --> 22:02.097
No, the swab came back negative,

22:02.165 --> 22:03.666
but you're definitely running a fever.

22:03.733 --> 22:05.501
Listen, Annie, you
shouldn't be on a stakeout.

22:05.569 --> 22:06.869
You need to rest.

22:06.937 --> 22:09.038
But, look, she just drew
him some kind of a map.

22:09.105 --> 22:11.373
To where... her place?

22:11.441 --> 22:14.310
I-I-I think I'm gonna be...

22:14.377 --> 22:15.644
- Are you...
- Sick.

- Uh, water, please, No ice.

23:06.229 --> 23:07.997
Water. Anything else?

23:08.064 --> 23:10.966
Uh, yes, the wi-fi password, please?

23:11.034 --> 23:13.469
That's all... Just water and wi-fi?

23:13.536 --> 23:14.470
Yes.

23:20.410 --> 23:22.077
Did I miss anything?

23:22.145 --> 23:24.346
Yeah, you did. He gave her an envelope.

23:24.414 --> 23:26.715
I think it was filled with cash.

23:26.783 --> 23:28.717
Uh, look, I need to draw some blood

23:28.785 --> 23:31.320
and perform an ultrasound
and a barium swallow.

23:34.291 --> 23:36.258
- Uh-oh.
- What is it. PDA?

23:36.326 --> 23:38.627
No, CPR.

23:38.695 --> 23:40.596
- [Grunting]
- Are you doing that too hard?

23:40.664 --> 23:42.298
Okay, someone call 911.

23:42.365 --> 23:45.367
Stop, stop. I don't think
he's having a heart attack.

23:45.435 --> 23:47.469
But he looks so white
and... and... and heavy.

23:47.537 --> 23:51.106
Yeah, but he's not heaving
for air or making any noise.

23:56.946 --> 23:58.580

which collapsed his lung.

[Gurgling] Okay.

24:16.232 --> 24:17.466
No rush of air.

24:17.534 --> 24:19.902
He's still not breathing. Maybe I was right.

24:19.969 --> 24:22.104
No, no, no, the needle isn't long enough

24:22.172 --> 24:25.641
to reach his pleural cavity.

24:25.709 --> 24:27.343
But this might be.

28:14.185 --> 28:16.253
When... when you're at a grocery store,

28:16.321 --> 28:17.955
do you buy groceries?

28:18.022 --> 28:20.123
- I do, yes.
- Cool.

28:20.191 --> 28:22.626

station, do you get gas?

28:22.694 --> 28:23.961
Yes.

So then why is it that
you're in a restaurant

28:26.497 --> 28:27.898
and you would not order food?

28:27.966 --> 28:30.434
I mean, if you're not hungry, perhaps...

28:30.501 --> 28:32.169

Yeah? Okay.

28:40.612 --> 28:42.579
- On wheat?
- Uh, whatever you suggest.

28:42.647 --> 28:46.016
Okay, one turkey club on wheat

28:46.084 --> 28:47.985
with just a touch of mustard.

28:48.052 --> 28:50.387

- Yes.

28:58.162 --> 28:59.763
Sure.

28:59.831 --> 29:03.367
The customer's always right.

29:05.670 --> 29:08.805
Take another sip.

29:08.873 --> 29:10.607
Great.

29:14.712 --> 29:18.215
So, Annie, the ultrasound
showed that your appendix

29:18.282 --> 29:19.983
and gallbladder were all clear.

29:20.051 --> 29:22.219
This stuff tastes like death.

29:22.286 --> 29:24.488
Right, but this barium swallow will allow us

29:24.555 --> 29:27.224
to check your esophagus and
stomach for any obstruction

29:27.291 --> 29:28.925
so you can avoid death.

29:28.993 --> 29:32.195
Annie, we still haven't
received your medical records.

29:32.263 --> 29:33.897
Would you mind calling your previous doctor

29:33.965 --> 29:35.932
to see if they can send them now?

29:36.000 --> 29:37.367
That's weird.

29:37.435 --> 29:39.102
The office said they would
send them over this morning.

29:39.170 --> 29:41.705
- I can check again.
- Thank you.

29:41.773 --> 29:44.307
- Ah, I have to go.
- Uh, not quite yet.

29:44.375 --> 29:45.676
Your esophagus looks good,

29:45.743 --> 29:47.844
but I'd still like to do a
small-bowel follow-through.

29:47.912 --> 29:49.980
Pritchard just arrived at a Montauk motel.

29:50.048 --> 29:51.748

You're working late.

30:13.271 --> 30:14.771
I thought you'd be home with the baby.

30:14.839 --> 30:17.174
Nanny Tilda is like a dream.

30:17.241 --> 30:18.508
She's got Sashi at your home right now

30:18.576 --> 30:19.743
learning to play the drum.

30:22.046 --> 30:23.547
Wow. A drum.

30:23.614 --> 30:25.315
That is like a dream.

30:25.383 --> 30:26.650
Mm.

30:26.718 --> 30:29.219
Are you going home soon?
Because I was going to ask you...

30:29.287 --> 30:30.787
- No, I'm not.
- Hey, guys.

30:30.855 --> 30:33.356
- Hey.
- Tell them.

30:33.424 --> 30:35.192
- No.
- Come on, tell them!

30:35.259 --> 30:36.426
I'm not... Look, we should...

30:36.494 --> 30:37.427
No, I don't want to make it a big thing...

30:37.495 --> 30:38.895
Evan built a bridge.

30:38.963 --> 30:40.931
Eddie and Emma are finally talking,

30:40.998 --> 30:43.133
and they're gonna get together
on their own tomorrow,

30:43.201 --> 30:44.835
and it's all because of Evan.

30:44.902 --> 30:47.137
Wow. Good for you, Ev.

30:47.205 --> 30:49.139
Thanks.

30:49.207 --> 30:50.273
[Chuckles]

30:50.341 --> 30:51.641
- Hank?
- Yeah?

30:51.709 --> 30:53.543
Annie's medical records just came through.

30:53.611 --> 30:55.846
No wonder I couldn't find them before.

30:55.913 --> 30:57.748
I know her as Annie Meadows,

30:57.815 --> 30:59.816
but these records are
under a different last name.

30:59.884 --> 31:02.319
Perhaps her maiden name?

31:02.386 --> 31:04.755
That's not her maiden name.

31:04.822 --> 31:08.024
Annie?

31:08.092 --> 31:10.527
- Annie!
- Where'd she go?

31:10.595 --> 31:12.429
Listen, do me a favor...
See if there's a hotel

31:12.497 --> 31:15.098
in Montauk called The Little Dune, okay?

31:18.002 --> 31:20.504
[Indistinct chatter]

31:20.571 --> 31:22.105
[Crying]

31:22.173 --> 31:26.977
[Car door opens, closes]

31:27.044 --> 31:30.614
He's your husband, isn't he?
The man you've been following.

31:30.681 --> 31:33.116
So now you're a detective too?

31:33.184 --> 31:36.119
You and Arnold share the
same last name... Pritchard.

31:36.187 --> 31:38.421
It was on the office door at the resort,

31:38.489 --> 31:40.457
and it was on your medical records.

31:40.525 --> 31:41.892
I spent all this time

31:41.959 --> 31:43.827
perfecting my investigative techniques.

31:43.895 --> 31:46.830
I never thought I'd need
it on my own marriage.

31:46.898 --> 31:48.865
I spent 12 years...

31:48.933 --> 31:50.967
I-I was thinking we were so special.

31:51.035 --> 31:53.770
[Gasps] And... and then
my intuition told me,

31:53.838 --> 31:55.172
"it's not just other wives,"

31:55.239 --> 31:57.174
that I had fallen into the trap myself.

31:57.241 --> 31:58.975
[Gasping]

31:59.043 --> 32:03.046
But now I'm gonna go confront him,

32:03.114 --> 32:05.081
but first, I'm just gonna lay down,

32:05.149 --> 32:06.650
or is it "lie down"? I'm never sure which...

32:06.717 --> 32:08.385
Annie, Annie, we need to
get you to the hospital.

32:08.452 --> 32:11.988
- You're having a heart attack.
- I'm not having a heart attack.

32:12.056 --> 32:13.590
I just can't... can't breathe... [Gasping]

32:13.658 --> 32:17.194
Here, I want you to chew this aspirin,

32:17.261 --> 32:20.130
and now I'm gonna put the nitroglycerine

32:20.198 --> 32:23.287
under your tongue.
Open. Put your tongue back.

32:23.355 --> 32:25.089
Good.

32:25.157 --> 32:26.591
if we can increase the blood flow

32:26.658 --> 32:28.426
and get you to the hospital fast,

32:28.493 --> 32:30.094
the damage to your heart
should still be reversible.

32:30.162 --> 32:32.029
No, no, no. I'm not having any chest pains.

32:32.097 --> 32:33.698
Look, women typically have more subtle,

32:33.765 --> 32:36.234
non-classic symptoms like the
ones you've been experiencing,

32:36.301 --> 32:38.369
and they can all be exacerbated by stress,

32:38.437 --> 32:40.738
which I now realize you have in spades.

32:40.806 --> 32:43.774
[Gasping]

32:47.012 --> 32:49.947
[Engine turning over]

33:01.826 --> 33:04.495
So the angioplasty was a success.

33:04.563 --> 33:06.330
You'll be on blood thinners for a while,

33:06.398 --> 33:08.032
and you'll follow up with a cardiologist,

33:08.099 --> 33:09.099
but you should be fine.

33:09.167 --> 33:11.769
And all those flu-like symptoms?

33:11.836 --> 33:15.706
Were plaque filling the
vessels of your heart.

33:15.774 --> 33:19.343
And now my heart is filled
with a different pain.

33:19.411 --> 33:21.745
Before I forget, um, in my bag,

33:21.813 --> 33:23.781
there is a file I meant to give you earlier.

33:23.848 --> 33:26.050
There it is, in my purse.
It's about your sister.

33:26.117 --> 33:28.786
Ah, thank you very much.

33:28.853 --> 33:30.054
Annie, are you okay?

33:30.121 --> 33:31.455
Oh, my God. I've been so worried.

33:31.523 --> 33:32.890
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

33:32.958 --> 33:34.124
I shouldn't be here.

33:34.192 --> 33:36.427
Arnold was so upset when the hospital called

33:36.494 --> 33:37.861
that I insisted on driving him here.

33:37.929 --> 33:39.897
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

33:39.965 --> 33:42.433
Did I die? Am I in hell?

33:42.500 --> 33:44.668
Hey, I know you. We met earlier.

33:44.736 --> 33:45.970
Yes, uh, that's right.

33:46.037 --> 33:48.072
We did, at the restaurant,
but, Mr. Pritchard,

33:48.139 --> 33:50.140
Annie's just been through
a very serious procedure.

33:50.208 --> 33:52.176
She needs to stay calm, relaxed...

33:52.244 --> 33:54.712
Absolutely, but now that
my wife's seen Kayla,

33:54.779 --> 33:56.247
I may as well tell her the truth.

33:56.314 --> 33:58.115
Now's probably not the best time.

33:58.183 --> 33:59.450
I found her online,

33:59.517 --> 34:00.985
saw her pictures, and I had to hire her.

34:01.052 --> 34:03.120
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, my God!

34:03.188 --> 34:05.322
Kayla's a car customizer.

34:05.390 --> 34:08.391
Huh. Did not see that coming.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.828
Annie fell in love with her designs
at a car show last year.

34:10.895 --> 34:13.264
Kroft car designs? You're Kayla Kroft?

34:13.331 --> 34:15.599
When Arnold found out I
was visiting the Hamptons,

34:15.667 --> 34:20.271
he hired me to customize a
new surveillance van for you.

34:20.338 --> 34:22.773
Oh, it has a little kitchen

34:22.841 --> 34:26.243
and a bathroom and a massage chair.

34:26.311 --> 34:30.547
It was being delivered to my
motel when the hospital called.

34:30.614 --> 34:32.416
I can't believe you did this.

34:32.484 --> 34:33.884
I wanted to give you

34:33.952 --> 34:36.887
a one-of-a-kind anniversary gift,

34:36.955 --> 34:38.922
but I should have known.

34:38.989 --> 34:41.681
I'm cursed to be married to a
woman who's superb at her job.

34:41.750 --> 34:44.318
She's impossible to surprise.

34:44.386 --> 34:46.520
oh, I think you may have done it this time.

34:46.588 --> 34:48.054
[Smooches]

34:48.123 --> 34:51.158
[Both chuckle]

34:51.226 --> 34:53.527
Hi, Judith.

34:53.594 --> 34:54.862
My nanny up and quit on me,

34:54.929 --> 34:57.464
so I had to bring Sashi
along for the follow-up.

34:57.532 --> 35:00.701
Oh, I don't think we need
one. The kids are just fine.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.007
You poached my nanny?

35:07.075 --> 35:09.610
Typical new-mom mistake...

35:09.678 --> 35:13.113
Never introduce a great
nanny to a desperate mother.

35:13.181 --> 35:16.784
Don't worry. You'll learn.

35:16.851 --> 35:19.687
[On television] To quote him,
"we democratized democracy,

35:19.754 --> 35:21.722
"but the rules of the economic game changed.

35:21.790 --> 35:23.524
"It became more global.

35:23.592 --> 35:26.694
We have downward pressure
not only on the"...

35:36.271 --> 35:39.206
[Zipper opens]

35:46.848 --> 35:48.282
Water. Wi-fi.

35:48.350 --> 35:49.750
Anything else?

35:49.818 --> 35:52.019
Um, the turkey club on whole wheat

35:52.087 --> 35:53.654
with just a touch of mustard.

35:56.291 --> 35:58.726
You know, I think you want a burger today.

35:58.793 --> 36:02.763
Oh, uh, yea... I-I'll have the burger.

36:02.831 --> 36:07.568
Medium-rare without the
bun and extra pickles.

36:07.636 --> 36:08.869
That is just how I want it.

36:08.937 --> 36:10.571
That's just how you'll get it.

36:10.639 --> 36:13.674
The bartender is always right.

36:13.742 --> 36:16.010
[Laughs]

36:24.653 --> 36:26.754
Evan! Hank!

36:26.821 --> 36:27.755
There you are.

36:27.822 --> 36:29.256
You are not gonna believe

36:29.324 --> 36:32.092
the extraordinary day I had today with Emma.

36:32.160 --> 36:33.894
I learned so many things...

36:33.962 --> 36:35.929
Big things, little things, crazy things.

36:35.997 --> 36:37.698
Okay, I'll give you an example, all right?

36:37.766 --> 36:41.268
You know that I love bacon
and peanut butter sandwiches.

36:41.336 --> 36:43.704
Guess who loves bacon and
peanut butter sandwiches.

36:43.772 --> 36:44.772
- Emma.
- Emma probably.

36:44.839 --> 36:46.273
Emma loves them!

36:46.341 --> 36:49.076
Okay, who's afraid of the
ocean? I am. So is she.

36:49.144 --> 36:50.544
She can't even swim.

36:50.612 --> 36:52.780
I'm telling you something...
People make fun of genetics.

36:52.847 --> 36:55.082
There is something to it.

36:55.150 --> 36:58.252
Okay, I know I'm not gonna make
up for 18 years with one day,

36:58.319 --> 37:01.388
but it's a start.

37:01.456 --> 37:03.257
Why the long faces?

37:03.324 --> 37:06.226
What's going on here?

37:06.294 --> 37:10.564
Uh, dad, you should...
You should probably sit down.

37:10.632 --> 37:12.599
- All right, I'm sitting.
- Good.

37:12.667 --> 37:16.236
Um, so the good news is

37:16.304 --> 37:19.406
that Emma is definitely your daughter.

37:19.474 --> 37:22.576
Here is the not so good news.

37:25.313 --> 37:27.314
No.

37:29.517 --> 37:32.686
What did Meredith do?

37:32.754 --> 37:34.188
How did you even get this?

37:34.255 --> 37:37.024
Hank hired a P.I. To do a
background check on Emma.

37:37.092 --> 37:39.393
This is a big deal, you know.
I wanted to be thorough.

37:39.461 --> 37:41.428
I wanted the facts, and now we have them.

37:41.496 --> 37:44.698
So now that we have them,
what are we gonna do?

37:44.766 --> 37:48.569
I just invited Emma to
accompany me on a book tour,

37:48.636 --> 37:51.972
and she seemed pretty excited
about coming along with me.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.974
Yeah, about that...

37:54.042 --> 37:56.643
We have a different idea.

38:00.318 --> 38:03.101
I suppose I brought this on myself.

38:03.275 --> 38:06.010
If I hadn't been so nervous
about leaving Sashi,

38:06.078 --> 38:07.912
then I would have trusted Tilda.

38:07.979 --> 38:12.049
Then she would have never
met that nanny poacher!

38:12.117 --> 38:14.685
So now tomorrow I'll have to spend all day

38:14.753 --> 38:15.920
interviewing nannies.

38:15.987 --> 38:17.421
The ironic part being that

38:17.489 --> 38:19.757
while I'll have 12 nannies in your kitchen,

38:19.825 --> 38:22.626
I'll have no one to watch over Sashi.

38:28.467 --> 38:32.403
I could help with Sashi.

38:32.471 --> 38:37.074
Really?

38:37.142 --> 38:39.777
I mean, that would be great.

38:39.845 --> 38:41.278
Thank you.

38:41.346 --> 38:44.115
Um, I do have somewhere I need
to be between 3:00 and 5:00.

38:46.318 --> 38:48.986
Hey, Jeremiah.

38:49.054 --> 38:52.990
You would tell me if we had
overstayed our welcome here,

38:53.058 --> 38:54.625
wouldn't you?

38:54.693 --> 38:58.429
You two could never overstay your welcome.

38:58.497 --> 39:00.664
Everything's fine.

39:06.772 --> 39:08.639
Sit down, kiddo.

39:08.707 --> 39:11.842
Just tell me what's wrong.

39:11.910 --> 39:15.346
We know you're 17, not 18.

39:15.413 --> 39:19.450
We know you've run away from home.

39:19.518 --> 39:21.418
Your mom's been looking for you.

39:21.486 --> 39:24.622
We know that Meredith got
into some gambling schemes

39:24.689 --> 39:28.659
and used you when you were
ten to count cards for her.

39:28.727 --> 39:32.163
Which is why you ended up in
foster care for a few months.

39:33.698 --> 39:36.133
Look, I don't know who told
you these stories. I...

39:36.201 --> 39:38.302
The private investigator that I hired.

39:38.370 --> 39:41.338
We know they're not stories.

39:41.406 --> 39:43.107
The only thing we don't know

39:43.175 --> 39:44.975
is what got you so mad at your mother

39:45.043 --> 39:47.812
that it made you run away.

39:53.718 --> 39:56.320
My mom and I only had one rule.

39:56.388 --> 39:59.523
We could lie to the people
who we were scamming,

39:59.591 --> 40:03.160
but with each other,
we had to tell the truth.

40:04.496 --> 40:06.831
When I found out that she had lied about you

40:06.898 --> 40:11.101
and that you were alive...

40:11.169 --> 40:14.438
I had to find you...

40:14.506 --> 40:18.275
Especially because I wanted to hurt her.

40:21.780 --> 40:23.814
[Sighs]

40:23.882 --> 40:26.951
So you can, uh...

40:27.018 --> 40:29.186
Pack me up and send me home now.

40:29.254 --> 40:31.388
I don't think so.

40:31.456 --> 40:35.226
We've called Meredith and
told her about our new plan.

40:35.293 --> 40:37.428
We want you to stay here for the summer.

40:37.495 --> 40:38.863
You can move in with me and Evan.

40:38.930 --> 40:40.364
Yeah, we figured you'd probably be sick

40:40.432 --> 40:41.732
of motel living by now.

40:41.800 --> 40:44.635
So I'm gonna go on the book tour by myself,

40:44.703 --> 40:47.671
but I'm gonna come back and
visit as often as I can.

40:47.739 --> 40:50.808
And in the meantime, you can
get to know the three of us.

40:50.876 --> 40:52.543
I have been nothing but trouble.

40:52.611 --> 40:55.246
Why do anything for me?

40:55.313 --> 40:57.081
Because we're your family.

41:00.418 --> 41:03.387
You know, I-I think I do need to sit down.

41:03.455 --> 41:05.589
Okay. Come inside.

41:08.793 --> 41:10.928
Everything worked out great.

41:10.996 --> 41:12.129
Yeah.

41:12.197 --> 41:16.433
Oh, you must be so relieved.

41:16.501 --> 41:20.104
- I paid her.
- What?

41:20.171 --> 41:23.207
I-I... That day before the bike ride.

41:23.275 --> 41:24.475
You bribed her?

41:24.542 --> 41:26.610
No, I didn't bribe her.

41:26.678 --> 41:29.580
It was... She's living in a motel.

41:29.648 --> 41:30.814
She's washing dishes, you know.

41:30.882 --> 41:32.483
Things are expensive here,

41:32.550 --> 41:36.086
and I wanted to make sure
she'd hang out with dad.

41:39.357 --> 41:41.792
She did seem to warm up to him quickly.

41:41.860 --> 41:44.228
- Oh, my God.
- No, Evan.

41:44.296 --> 41:48.432
She's happy to be here,
to be with all of us.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.067
She wasn't looking to be bought.

41:50.135 --> 41:53.437
Yeah, I was, uh...
I was trying to be a good brother.

41:53.505 --> 41:55.673
Who cares deeply about his father.

41:57.976 --> 41:59.612
I wanted to help him.

41:59.612 --> 42:03.100
So, yeah, it was really
important that Emma liked him

42:03.100 --> 42:05.259
Or at least give him a chance.
She was gonna leave.

42:05.316 --> 42:07.344
Obviously, Eddie doesn't know. But...

42:07.344 --> 42:08.666
What about Hank?

42:08.715 --> 42:09.631
Have you told him?

42:09.631 --> 42:11.016
No, and I'm not going to.

42:12.785 --> 42:14.163
[Sigh]

42:16.481 --> 42:19.310
So she's staying because of us?
Or she's staying because of the money?

42:23.517 --> 42:27.917
