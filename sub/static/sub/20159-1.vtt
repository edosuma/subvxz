03:09.139 --> 03:10.622
Please, you must drink some tea.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.457
Here. Take it off.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.093
Here.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.295
Could you move your head forward
please?

03:16.297 --> 03:18.063
A little.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.298
There we go.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.670
Nice meeting you again.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.744
I demand to be set free.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.746
Now... Now!

03:34.748 --> 03:35.948
Please drink.

03:35.950 --> 03:37.015
No, thank you.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.584
It may taste strange,
even bitter,

03:38.586 --> 03:40.419
but it will help you adapt
to the altitude.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.853
I do not care.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.089
The tea is brewed
from coca leaves, that is it.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.458
I want my handcuffs removed.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.194
You have scratched one of
my men and bitten another.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.429
I am proud of that.

03:50.431 --> 03:54.266
Well, that is why
you are wearing handcuffs!

03:57.071 --> 03:59.071
Can I take them off now?

03:59.073 --> 04:00.539
Look at me!

04:01.108 --> 04:02.708
Look at me.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.042
Can I take them off now?

04:04.044 --> 04:05.811
Yes, you can!

04:11.619 --> 04:13.285
Please put the cup down.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.020
Put the cup down.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.357
Your hands...

04:22.296 --> 04:24.296
Ah! Ah!

04:28.969 --> 04:30.969
Is that better?

04:31.372 --> 04:32.938
I demand an explanation.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.606
Everything will fall into place.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.308
When will I get
my passport back?

04:36.310 --> 04:37.242
I'm not sure.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.810
When will I be able to leave?

04:38.812 --> 04:40.852
Of that, too, I am unsure.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.518
I'm hungry.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.988
I haven't eaten
since I was on the plane.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.157
30 hours ago.

05:09.677 --> 05:10.842
Thank you.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.845
Here.
Please, take the tablecloth.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.564
Thanks.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.282
Would you like me to get you
something else?

05:17.284 --> 05:18.850
No, I get terribly jet-lagged

05:18.852 --> 05:21.286
when I eat too much
on overnight flights.

05:21.288 --> 05:23.155
Just leave me
the apple juice, please.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.837
- Okay.
- Thank you.

05:27.594 --> 05:28.594
Sweetheart.

05:29.463 --> 05:32.164
Can I have another
glass of champagne, please?

05:32.166 --> 05:33.398
Your fourth?

05:34.435 --> 05:37.069
I like that you keep count
on what's good for me.

05:39.039 --> 05:43.408
And another glass for
my most attractive companion.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.277
Professor Sommerfeld.

05:45.279 --> 05:49.448
L-A-U-R-A Sommerfeld.

05:50.417 --> 05:51.883
<i>Merci.</i>

05:56.990 --> 05:58.557
Let's celebrate.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.395
Celebrate what?

06:05.833 --> 06:08.734
Can we get another glass
for Dr. Meier,

06:08.736 --> 06:12.137
who's right there,
across the isle?

06:12.139 --> 06:14.873
We are all on the same...
journey together.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.943
We need to warm up
for the journey ahead.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.578
Make mine a double bourbon.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.380
Straight, no ice.

06:21.382 --> 06:26.752
And, uh, what, if I may ask,

06:26.754 --> 06:28.820
is your joyful party all about?

06:28.822 --> 06:30.789
We are a scientific delegation.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.023
Ah.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.825
She's Professor
Laura Sommerfeld,

06:33.827 --> 06:35.260
our fearless leader.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.763
We come with the United Nations.

06:37.765 --> 06:41.299
To look into
an ecological disaster.

06:41.301 --> 06:43.568
The Diablo Blanco Disaster.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.570
Diablo Blanco?
I hadn't heard of that.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.407
Diablo Blanco will soon be
a household name.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.190
Dr. Cavani.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.661
Fabio.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.764
You can call me Fabio.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.011
Sorry.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.650
Is there anyway
I could change seats?

08:05.652 --> 08:08.954
I am so sorry.
The plane is completely full.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.291
I'm so sorry I can't help.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.047
Professor Sommerfeld.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.616
Sleep well.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.720
Call me Laura.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.904
What's the local time?

08:58.906 --> 09:00.939
- I don't know.
- Let me do it for you.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.274
Thank you.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.044
What's our greeter's name?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.046
Helmholtz.

09:08.015 --> 09:12.317
He's from the Ministry of
Agriculture and the Environment,

09:12.319 --> 09:15.186
and he's coming
with two people, um...

09:16.690 --> 09:18.290
which, uh...

09:18.859 --> 09:20.091
Uh...

09:20.093 --> 09:22.060
I can't seem to read this.
It's...

09:22.062 --> 09:23.828
It's my own handwriting. I...

09:23.830 --> 09:26.965
I don't even understand it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.506
Hm, no. No signal.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.644
Mine's dead, too.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.317
We will ask them to provide us
with local phones.

09:45.319 --> 09:47.385
You know but, my apps
can become very useful.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.653
Such as?

09:48.655 --> 09:50.055
My diary.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.724
April 14th...

09:53.460 --> 09:56.761
Arrivals hall, immigration line.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.897
The line is, uh...

09:58.899 --> 10:00.865
lethargic.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.501
It's, uh, listless...

10:03.503 --> 10:05.337
torpid...

10:05.339 --> 10:06.871
moribund.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.441
I think I put that quite well,
didn't I?

10:09.443 --> 10:10.675
Right?

10:11.445 --> 10:13.712
And, uh, we're waiting.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.615
And staring.

10:16.617 --> 10:19.250
Staring.
People staring at us.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.586
As if they were competing
for the world championship

10:21.588 --> 10:23.088
of slow looks.

10:23.090 --> 10:26.324
Dr, Meier,
why are they staring at us?

10:26.326 --> 10:30.462
When I stare back at them,
they don't look away.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.532
Where is my luggage?

11:40.534 --> 11:42.567
Mine is not coming out either.

11:44.204 --> 11:48.273
Oh, fuck, I forgot
to pack my toothbrush.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.608
I didn't bring
a toothbrush with me.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.344
<i>Mierda.</i>

12:07.294 --> 12:08.727
<i>No? Bueno.</i>

12:08.729 --> 12:10.128
<i>Gracias.</i>

12:10.831 --> 12:12.030
Let's just go.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.193
Yeah.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.001
It happens.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.207
Well...

12:57.144 --> 12:59.911
I'm sure they'll come
any minute now.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.213
Sure thing. Oh, yeah.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.716
Where are they?

13:04.718 --> 13:06.551
You confirmed
our arrival plans, Cavani?

13:06.553 --> 13:07.485
Right?

13:07.487 --> 13:09.387
Right-o! Yeah.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.789
I did.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.090
Shall I check at the curb?

13:12.092 --> 13:13.324
No, no, no.
Let's stick together.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.860
Someone will show up
sooner or later.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.607
Hello, hello.
I'm sorry I'm late.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.376
It's me. Welcome.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.946
Oh, Professor Sommerfeld.
Welcome, welcome.

13:34.948 --> 13:35.814
Hello!

13:35.816 --> 13:38.216
- Doctor Cavani, welcome.
- Yes.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.384
You must be Dr. Meier.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.619
Welcome to you, too, sir.
Welcome.

13:41.621 --> 13:42.821
Did you have a good flight?

13:42.823 --> 13:43.721
Yeah. Good.

13:43.723 --> 13:45.223
We are just
a little bit jet-lagged.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.125
Of course, I can understand.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.527
Oh, I'm sorry,
I haven't introduced myself.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.029
I am Aristides
from the Ministry.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.197
Aristides?

13:52.199 --> 13:54.098
Yes. Aristides.
Now...

13:54.100 --> 13:55.533
the Minister
and his group apologize.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.468
There has been
a change of plans.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.704
The Minister is already
in Oruro,

13:59.706 --> 14:02.807
and he asks that you
take his plane directly there.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.715
"Forgive us, kind gentlemen,

14:10.717 --> 14:14.319
but we are forced to meet you
in Oruro later today."

14:14.321 --> 14:17.255
The letterhead
says Internal Security.

14:17.257 --> 14:18.523
Isn't our liaison

14:18.525 --> 14:21.259
the Minister of Agriculture
and the Environment?

14:21.261 --> 14:23.895
Oh, there's been a mistake.
This shouldn't be here.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.029
A mistake?

14:25.031 --> 14:27.465
Yes. This is a mistake. Uh...

14:27.467 --> 14:28.766
Uh...

14:28.768 --> 14:31.135
I wasn't supposed
to let you know,

14:31.137 --> 14:32.170
but I am obliged to now.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.404
The Minister is, in fact,

14:33.406 --> 14:35.974
also associated with
the security establishment.

14:35.976 --> 14:39.410
It shows his increasing
importance within the government.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.679
But we don't
have our luggage yet.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.514
Oh, don't worry about that.
Don't worry about anything.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.583
My boys will take care
of everything.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.585
In fact, they'll see you
through security.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.654
No inspections, no passports.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.422
I just need your luggage tags

14:51.424 --> 14:54.759
and we'll have your luggage
taken directly to the plane.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.661
Great.
Sounds like a treat.

14:57.764 --> 15:00.064
Okay. Let's go.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.736
I'm afraid
I'll have to leave you here.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.672
- And our luggage?
- It's already loaded.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.273
How did you load it so quickly?

15:42.275 --> 15:44.242
This isn't a German airport
or New York.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.476
We are much more efficient.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.911
It's just my instruments.

15:46.913 --> 15:49.213
I don't care about my shirts,
but my equipment.

15:49.215 --> 15:50.949
Let us worry about all that.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.650
Bon voyage.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.154
Please, come aboard.

16:31.925 --> 16:33.691
I'm kind of hungry.

16:35.929 --> 16:38.629
My apologies.
I ate half.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.032
Thank you.

16:42.168 --> 16:45.670
"For one, too much.
For all, too little."

16:45.672 --> 16:47.905
Sounds familiar.
Who said that?

16:48.675 --> 16:50.274
Alexander the Great.

16:51.444 --> 16:55.313
One day his army
was perishing from thirst...

16:55.315 --> 16:57.148
and a foot soldier came by

16:57.150 --> 16:59.350
with a helmet filled with water

16:59.352 --> 17:02.120
he had collected drop by drop
for weeks.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.689
He gave it to Alexander,

17:04.691 --> 17:06.656
who spilled it on the floor.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.826
And he had said that.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.128
He said, "For one, too much.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.964
For all, too little."

17:13.900 --> 17:16.401
It's not going to be easy
out there.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.737
As long as I have my equipment
everything will be fine.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.440
As long as we have some
pasta al dente

17:22.442 --> 17:24.375
and some white truffles...

17:24.377 --> 17:27.979
and a buxom wench serving wine.

17:27.981 --> 17:31.215
And some vineyards
in the mountains...

17:31.217 --> 17:34.085
and the lusty cheers
of the vintners...

17:34.087 --> 17:36.487
Cavani, you are a poet.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.523
Everything will be fine.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.621
Please come out.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.126
What is this?

18:15.128 --> 18:16.427
Who are these men?

18:17.130 --> 18:19.530
I am not going to get out here.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.300
Where-where is the Minister?

18:22.302 --> 18:25.703
Please. Please step out.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.170
Ay. No, no, no.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.371
No, no, no, no, no, no no.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.523
What is this?

19:35.524 --> 19:37.674
You are under our protection.
We have a security problem.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.743
Who are you?

19:38.745 --> 19:40.545
- I know who I am.
- Who sent you?

19:40.547 --> 19:42.197
I'm not gonna tell you.

19:42.198 --> 19:43.848
I am professor Sommerfeld
and leader of this delegation.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.750
We are under the protection
of the government.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.852
Yes, yes. And?

19:47.854 --> 19:50.454
And we are under the protection
of the United Nations.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.523
I know, I know, I know.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.226
Come outside, please.
We have cars waiting for you.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.761
Hey, and our luggage?

19:56.763 --> 19:59.697
Hey... don't touch me.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.099
I'm not going.
I'll stay here!

20:02.101 --> 20:04.635
I'm not going with you!
Don't touch me!

20:04.637 --> 20:06.537
You are my prisoners!

20:06.539 --> 20:08.039
All of you are my prisoners!

20:13.880 --> 20:15.813
Hold this motherfucker!

20:17.817 --> 20:20.017
Ah! Dr. Meier!

20:22.021 --> 20:24.088
Ah! Ay, ay, ay, ay.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.556
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.024
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.526
<i>- Vamos!</i>
- Ay!

20:29.963 --> 20:31.062
No!

20:33.499 --> 20:35.933
Dr. Meier, don't fight.
They'll hurt you.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.202
Stop fighting back!

20:38.204 --> 20:40.371
We give up!
Stop!

20:46.479 --> 20:47.878
Ah!

20:47.880 --> 20:49.914
Meier? Meier?

20:52.418 --> 20:53.951
<i>Vamos, vamos!</i>

21:24.917 --> 21:26.217
Get him away.

21:26.219 --> 21:28.853
Come on.
Get this motherfucker away.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.217
Don't touch me.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.295
So...

23:19.699 --> 23:21.899
This was all a plan
from the beginning?

23:21.901 --> 23:23.768
In a way, yes.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.738
Why have you abducted us?
What's your plan now?

23:27.740 --> 23:30.007
Everything will fall into place.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.742
It depends on you.

23:32.545 --> 23:34.545
There is no question
that our embassy

23:34.547 --> 23:36.614
has been alerted
to our disappearance.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.716
They are already in crisis mode.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.050
But it is irrelevant,

23:40.052 --> 23:42.953
because there will be
no negotiations.

23:44.257 --> 23:47.024
And the delegation who was
supposed to meet us upon arrival?

23:47.026 --> 23:48.392
Have you taken them, too?

23:48.394 --> 23:51.796
No. They were easily bribed.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.697
I take no pride in this.

23:53.699 --> 23:56.000
I don't approve of pay-offs
to anyone.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.501
Do me one favor!

23:57.503 --> 23:59.937
Do not try to come
to the rescue...

23:59.939 --> 24:02.239
of a tired world.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.809
I'd like to know your name.

24:04.811 --> 24:07.912
As long as I wear this mask
I have no name.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.681
But I know the face
of this gentleman.

24:10.683 --> 24:13.217
Krauss, why don't you
remove your mask?

24:13.219 --> 24:15.386
You are compromised, aren't you?

24:17.523 --> 24:20.558
Krauss? You said
your name was Aristides.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.761
In fact, if facts count here,
it isn't Aristides.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.830
So it is Krauss.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.832
Yes, and no.

24:28.835 --> 24:31.035
And how were you able
to get here so quickly?

24:31.037 --> 24:33.637
- We have our ways.
- And who is "we"? I would like to know.

24:33.639 --> 24:36.006
"We"... that is basically me.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.708
I am the brain.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.611
I am leading a delegation.

24:40.613 --> 24:43.080
I am responsible
for its members.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.316
Where are they?
Are they all right?

24:45.318 --> 24:47.284
I can assure you they are fine.

24:47.286 --> 24:50.554
I accept no assurances
from an unidentified man

24:50.556 --> 24:52.356
with no name and no face.

24:52.358 --> 24:54.458
I want to see them, now.

24:54.460 --> 24:55.793
Well, hopefully...

24:55.795 --> 25:00.397
the time will come when there
are no more secrets between us.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.402
Dr. Arnold Meier
and Dr. Fabio Cavani

25:05.404 --> 25:07.638
are both here at the compound.

25:09.475 --> 25:11.041
How is Dr. Meier?

25:11.043 --> 25:13.177
I saw your men hurt him.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.913
He is bruised,
but otherwise subdued.

25:15.915 --> 25:16.981
Meaning what?

25:16.983 --> 25:19.316
As Dr. Meier
proved to be so combative,

25:19.318 --> 25:22.119
we had to calm his heroism
a little bit.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.522
Krauss, why don't you
show Professor Sommerfeld

25:24.524 --> 25:26.824
the food she should avoid.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.759
Go on, have a look.

25:31.330 --> 25:33.364
Please do not eat these,

25:33.366 --> 25:36.567
even if offered with every
indication of warm hospitality.

25:36.569 --> 25:38.068
You gave this to my delegation?

25:38.070 --> 25:40.504
We did nothing.
Our guests ate it...

25:40.506 --> 25:44.108
and then they came down with a local
form of... What's happened to them?

25:44.110 --> 25:45.042
Say it.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.710
Diarrhea.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.432
Krauss...

25:48.814 --> 25:51.582
why don't you show our guest
to her quarters?

26:10.970 --> 26:12.770
Life in a wheelchair
has its comforts,

26:12.772 --> 26:14.238
but not all the time.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.339
I see.

26:15.341 --> 26:18.042
It's okay.
One day I shall walk again.

26:18.044 --> 26:21.445
Dr. Meier, Dr. Cavani,
please come to the window.

26:22.815 --> 26:25.749
I... I'm dying.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.017
- No, you're not.
- I'm dying, I'm...

26:27.019 --> 26:28.519
- No, you're not.
- I'm dying.

26:28.521 --> 26:30.187
- No, you're not.
- I'm dying!

26:30.188 --> 26:31.854
The dumplings, it must have
been the dumplings.

26:31.857 --> 26:33.057
Are you hurt?

26:33.059 --> 26:35.125
Yes, but I am going to be fine.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.660
It's just my stomach.

26:36.662 --> 26:38.596
I've got
the Dresden of Diarrhea.

26:38.598 --> 26:41.632
It's a horde of protozoans

26:41.634 --> 26:43.767
swirling around
my intestinal tract.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.036
I may be dying.
I may be dying.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.571
The noblest place
for a man to die

26:47.573 --> 26:49.740
is the place
he dies the deadest.

26:51.177 --> 26:54.144
This is the
Mother of all Diarrhea.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.479
Take care.

26:55.481 --> 26:57.648
Keep yourself hydrated
and get some rest.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.316
Professor Sommerfeld,

26:59.318 --> 27:01.485
I wish I could help you.

27:15.601 --> 27:17.635
Please abstain from gossiping
in that ugly language.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.637
I'm fine,
I can take care of myself,

27:19.639 --> 27:22.306
of my situation,
of our situation.

27:22.308 --> 27:25.275
Let me try.
- Madame...

27:25.277 --> 27:26.343
please follow me.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.712
Your quarters
are in the adjacent courtyard.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.786
This way.

27:39.558 --> 27:41.759
Ay, ay...

27:43.295 --> 27:44.895
Ay, ay...

29:35.775 --> 29:38.542
Laura, you look a mess.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.667
Good morning.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.536
Good morning.

30:06.505 --> 30:07.938
Good morning.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.342
Rest assured.
This food is safe to eat.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.224
Thank you, Krauss.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.954
Half for you, half for me.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.522
You choose.

30:29.461 --> 30:30.994
Excuse me for taking your share,

30:30.996 --> 30:32.429
but I'm hungry.

30:33.132 --> 30:35.098
And I'm sure...

30:35.100 --> 30:38.435
you didn't abduct me
to poison me.

30:38.437 --> 30:41.538
Not at all. I'm
glad to see you eating.

30:50.482 --> 30:53.784
I would like to see Dr. Meier
and Dr. Cavani.

30:53.786 --> 30:55.919
Be assured...

30:55.921 --> 30:58.589
they are my respected guests.

31:04.897 --> 31:07.231
Why are you holding me hostage?

31:07.233 --> 31:08.932
Is it for money?

31:09.869 --> 31:13.003
I can contact some officials
to negotiate.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.404
No.

31:15.741 --> 31:17.541
Tell me what you want.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.076
You must be Secret Service.

31:19.078 --> 31:21.245
Are you enjoying the massive
support of the government?

31:21.247 --> 31:22.913
I am no Secret Service,
no government,

31:22.915 --> 31:25.549
no plot of the CIA,
or anything of the sort.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.317
Who are you, then?

31:30.422 --> 31:32.856
Professor, I expected more
of you.

31:35.427 --> 31:36.994
Matt Riley.

31:39.732 --> 31:42.299
The CEO of the Consortium.

31:44.403 --> 31:48.705
The Consortium exists
only as a legal entity today.

31:48.707 --> 31:51.541
As you may know, after the
ever-opportunistic Swiss

31:51.543 --> 31:53.143
sold their majority stock,

31:53.145 --> 31:55.345
the Chinese, the Americans,

31:55.347 --> 31:57.247
the South Koreans...

31:57.249 --> 32:00.951
all ducked into the trenches
and became invisible.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.819
But they're still there.

32:03.956 --> 32:07.824
They are all responsible
for the Diablo Blanco Disaster.

32:07.826 --> 32:10.227
Despite that the disaster
had already begun

32:10.229 --> 32:14.298
when I took over as CEO,
I personally feel responsible.

32:15.968 --> 32:19.136
But you must have known
it was not a singular event.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.071
It has evolved over decades.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.173
We have measurements,
data and statistics

32:23.175 --> 32:23.974
since the '70s.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.475
Data.

32:25.477 --> 32:27.844
Statistics.

32:27.846 --> 32:30.013
I see another side to it.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.616
Public Relations.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.685
Don't belittle yourself.

32:35.921 --> 32:37.821
I'm not prepared
to speak about it now.

32:37.823 --> 32:40.757
Because you are trying to hide
a big conspiracy, Mr Riley?

32:40.759 --> 32:43.093
Ah, I find that silly.

32:44.063 --> 32:46.229
There is no reality...

32:47.299 --> 32:49.433
there are only views of reality.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.768
Only perceptions.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.303
All collective anxieties

32:53.305 --> 32:56.540
condense into
conspiracy theories.

32:57.343 --> 33:00.243
My data is real.
There is a disaster.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.046
Yes, and there are
three million Americans

33:03.048 --> 33:06.717
who claim they have had
encounters with aliens.

33:06.719 --> 33:09.186
Among them,
three hundred thousand women

33:09.188 --> 33:11.488
who claim
that they have been abducted

33:11.490 --> 33:15.258
and gang-raped by aliens.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.762
Now this leads me
to two questions.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.630
One...

33:20.632 --> 33:24.801
Why do all these women
weigh over 350 pounds?

33:24.803 --> 33:25.969
And, two...

33:25.971 --> 33:28.472
Why have we never heard
of a single abducted woman

33:28.474 --> 33:30.374
in Ethiopia?

33:30.843 --> 33:31.908
Hm?

33:34.246 --> 33:39.049
Of course the Diablo Blanco
Disaster exists.

33:39.051 --> 33:41.218
And it is not static.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.652
It is spreading.

33:42.654 --> 33:46.823
And my delegation has been sent
to determine at what rate...

33:46.825 --> 33:49.426
and make our findings public.

33:50.095 --> 33:51.361
What prevents me from doing so

33:51.363 --> 33:53.864
is that you have
taken me prisoner.

33:53.866 --> 34:01.838
I am prepared to accept
the consequences.

34:01.840 --> 34:05.242
Even go to prison
for what I am doing.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.577
I demand to be released!

34:07.579 --> 34:09.579
Don't pressure me!

34:09.581 --> 34:13.550
This could end very badly
for both of us.

34:13.552 --> 34:16.085
Do you want to be a martyr?!

35:05.804 --> 35:08.171
I'm Laura Sommerfeld.

35:08.173 --> 35:09.906
I've been abducted.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.542
I have been in a car...

35:12.544 --> 35:15.645
at least two or three hours.

35:19.485 --> 35:21.751
I do not know where I am,

35:21.753 --> 35:23.487
<i>but I will play their game</i>

35:23.489 --> 35:26.256
<i>to figure out what Riley wants.</i>

35:38.337 --> 35:39.769
<i>Hola.</i>

35:39.771 --> 35:45.709
Remember now thy Creator
in the days of thy youth.

35:47.513 --> 35:51.948
This magnificent specimen,
Mr. McMurphy, speaks.

35:51.950 --> 35:54.184
What did it just say?

35:54.186 --> 35:57.554
"Remember now thy Creator
in the days of thy youth."

35:58.624 --> 36:01.791
You know what Nostradamus said
about talking birds?

36:01.793 --> 36:03.593
No. I do not read Nostradamus.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.195
Hm.

36:05.197 --> 36:09.466
He foretold what sounds
like science fiction today.

36:09.468 --> 36:14.538
He said, "Household pets
finally communicate with man.

36:14.540 --> 36:17.707
Life then possible
outside the planet.

36:17.709 --> 36:21.511
A new tyrant sows terror.
Events to come."

36:22.514 --> 36:25.148
A world run by big data
and predictive analytics

36:25.150 --> 36:29.186
doesn't care
about Renaissance predictions.

36:29.188 --> 36:32.889
I want to know
how Meier and Cavani are.

36:32.891 --> 36:35.025
It's not so much
the predictions themselves

36:35.027 --> 36:37.260
that fascinate me, it's...

36:37.262 --> 36:41.031
where they come from.
Are they true?

36:41.033 --> 36:44.334
Is it possible that there is
something all-pervading around us

36:44.336 --> 36:46.336
which we
are incapable of seeing,

36:46.338 --> 36:49.706
that your data can't analyze...

36:49.708 --> 36:53.109
which only the prophets
and birds can express?

36:55.981 --> 37:00.483
He has the habit of saying it
at the oddest moments.

37:00.485 --> 37:04.554
"Remember now thy Creator
in the days of thy youth,

37:04.556 --> 37:06.756
while the evil days come not,

37:06.758 --> 37:09.059
nor the years draw nigh,

37:09.061 --> 37:11.428
when thou shalt say,

37:11.430 --> 37:13.897
I had no pleasure in them."

37:15.200 --> 37:16.933
Ecclesiastes.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.680
<i>You have done
research at the Institute</i>

37:30.682 --> 37:33.283
for Developmental Biology
in Tubingen?

37:33.285 --> 37:35.151
I worked with model organisms,

37:35.153 --> 37:37.687
such as the zebra fish,
fruit flies,

37:37.689 --> 37:40.223
and a form of cress
from the cabbage family.

37:40.225 --> 37:41.791
Interesting.

37:41.793 --> 37:45.195
It has been shown that genes
which influence development

37:45.197 --> 37:47.297
work in a similar way
in different organisms,

37:47.299 --> 37:51.101
be they flies, or people,
or cress.

37:51.103 --> 37:53.169
And you are currently
doing research

37:53.171 --> 37:55.405
at the Max Planck
Institute of Biochemistry

37:55.407 --> 37:56.706
in Munich.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.709
Technically yes.

37:59.711 --> 38:03.079
But here, you are thrown back
into biochemistry.

38:04.449 --> 38:07.751
Sometimes you do step back
in your life.

38:07.753 --> 38:10.153
You don't seem pleased by this.

38:11.256 --> 38:12.856
- Well...
- Your life...

38:12.858 --> 38:14.157
as I have observed it,

38:14.159 --> 38:16.760
seems to be a happy one for you.

38:16.762 --> 38:19.362
There is someone's future
to care for.

38:20.932 --> 38:24.100
What do you know about my life?

38:24.102 --> 38:26.036
Are you not blessed
with a beautiful daughter?

38:26.038 --> 38:27.704
Eight years old?

38:34.513 --> 38:37.580
I'm... I'm sorry.

38:38.283 --> 38:39.949
What a clumsy fool I am.

38:39.951 --> 38:43.953
I find your treatment
of my colleagues and me clumsy.

38:43.955 --> 38:47.524
Accepted. But for that,
I shall not apologize.

38:47.526 --> 38:50.527
I've given up part of myself,
but not that.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.869
How are Meier and Cavani?

39:03.975 --> 39:06.476
If you have harmed
Meier or Cavani,

39:06.478 --> 39:09.446
you will be tried before
an international tribunal

39:09.448 --> 39:12.549
and you will suffer
severe punishment.

39:16.588 --> 39:18.855
Can we finally talk business?

39:18.857 --> 39:20.957
Mr. Krauss,
do I see you walking?

39:20.959 --> 39:22.192
Yes, you do.

39:22.194 --> 39:23.693
Is this a miracle?

39:23.695 --> 39:27.364
No, I only use the wheelchair
when I am tired of life.

39:27.366 --> 39:28.631
This is not the way
we should do it.

39:28.633 --> 39:31.434
I propose we finish it now.
The moment of truth.

39:31.436 --> 39:34.003
Not the entire truth.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.405
If that moment is to ever come,

39:35.407 --> 39:38.208
it will depend
on Professor Sommerfeld.

39:38.210 --> 39:40.009
And on time.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.780
How much time?

39:47.386 --> 39:49.052
Truth...

39:49.054 --> 39:51.688
is the only daughter of Time.

40:06.171 --> 40:09.105
<i>I somehow
feel a threat out there.</i>

40:09.107 --> 40:12.308
<i>I'm glad I have the distraction
of my data.</i>

40:27.459 --> 40:29.292
<i>There is something strange</i>

40:29.294 --> 40:32.295
<i>and potentially dangerous
about Riley.</i>

40:32.297 --> 40:34.731
<i>I need to keep him talking.</i>

40:53.585 --> 40:55.385
We have a lot of documentation

40:55.387 --> 40:58.154
on the court proceedings
against animals.

41:01.393 --> 41:02.625
Oh yeah, see.

41:03.261 --> 41:05.328
A sow was sentenced to death

41:05.330 --> 41:08.498
for killing and eating
a toddler.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.934
The pig was burnt at the stake.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.102
And here.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.270
The salamander?

41:14.272 --> 41:17.207
Oh yeah, the salamander was...

41:17.209 --> 41:19.075
believed to originate from fire,

41:19.077 --> 41:21.678
being a companion of the devil.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.313
See, here it says,

41:23.315 --> 41:27.617
"This salamander was exorcised
with a bucket of holy water.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.185
Then burned."

41:32.924 --> 41:35.758
I think I was meant
to live a different life.

41:43.602 --> 41:45.568
Look in this silver column.

41:49.541 --> 41:51.307
Wow.

41:51.309 --> 41:53.676
I see, it's anamorphic art.

41:53.678 --> 41:55.198
Yes.

41:57.249 --> 42:00.650
And this is
The Descent from the Cross.

42:02.654 --> 42:04.554
You see,
this is what your situation

42:04.556 --> 42:06.256
must look like to you,

42:06.258 --> 42:08.091
unclear, contorted.

42:08.994 --> 42:10.693
But if you move
one step further,

42:10.695 --> 42:12.495
everything falls into place.

42:12.497 --> 42:14.497
Everything makes sense.

42:16.468 --> 42:17.734
At least, that's what I think.

42:17.736 --> 42:20.537
It's a question of which angle
you choose to look from.

42:20.539 --> 42:23.439
This sounds like a banality,
like-like...

42:23.441 --> 42:26.342
Like what?
I am open to criticism.

42:26.344 --> 42:29.345
Well, I don't want
to sound insulting,

42:29.347 --> 42:31.548
but it sounds
like a shallow pseudo argument,

42:31.550 --> 42:34.651
like "all Africans have rhythm
in their blood."

42:36.254 --> 42:38.087
I bow to you.

42:40.492 --> 42:45.461
May I be more precise about
different angles, perspectives?

42:45.463 --> 42:46.930
Yes.

42:50.302 --> 42:54.671
All my life... I've wanted
to see this in person.

43:01.012 --> 43:03.112
Where is this cloister?

43:04.082 --> 43:05.415
In Rome.

43:05.417 --> 43:09.419
In the convent of
the Santissima Trinità.

43:09.421 --> 43:11.988
Now, just look
along this corridor.

43:13.525 --> 43:14.991
Completely normal.

43:14.993 --> 43:17.961
A saint sitting under a tree.

43:19.431 --> 43:20.496
But...

43:21.032 --> 43:24.000
the nearer one approaches,
the more...

43:24.002 --> 43:26.803
incomprehensible
the forms become.

43:28.006 --> 43:29.872
Until...

43:30.475 --> 43:32.175
Look at this.

43:32.877 --> 43:35.011
The folds in the saint's cowl

43:35.013 --> 43:39.148
become this vast
stretched out landscape.

43:39.150 --> 43:41.084
The folds, in fact,
elongated like this,

43:41.086 --> 43:42.986
become the Strait of Messina,

43:42.988 --> 43:44.454
which the saint wanted to cross,

43:44.456 --> 43:47.824
but the boatman
would not take him.

43:47.826 --> 43:50.893
So he threw his coat
onto the water...

43:50.895 --> 43:52.996
and surfed to Sicily.

43:56.501 --> 44:00.069
Just imagine yourself
walking along this cloister.

44:01.973 --> 44:04.307
<i>I have always dreamed of this.</i>

44:46.418 --> 44:47.684
You know, the truth is

44:47.686 --> 44:51.988
I don't really wanna be CEO
of the Consortium anymore...

44:51.990 --> 44:54.123
or anything else,
for that matter.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.927
That's why I live here.
It's a different life.

44:59.564 --> 45:02.432
I'm trying to bring
who I really am into focus.

45:02.434 --> 45:03.866
You see?

45:20.051 --> 45:21.651
I would have offered you
these quarters

45:21.653 --> 45:23.920
for your comfort,
but I couldn't.

45:25.757 --> 45:27.590
Why is that?

45:27.592 --> 45:30.660
Well. a hundred years ago...

45:30.662 --> 45:33.863
the President of the Republic
died in this bed,

45:33.865 --> 45:36.699
and it has to be kept this way
for all time.

45:40.138 --> 45:43.005
There are so many
ancient things here.

45:46.745 --> 45:48.978
May I be straightforward?

45:55.820 --> 45:57.820
What do you want from me?

45:59.991 --> 46:01.791
I kind of like you.

46:04.362 --> 46:06.362
Me, as a person?

46:06.364 --> 46:07.864
No.

46:07.866 --> 46:09.365
As a woman?

46:10.735 --> 46:12.335
I find you very attractive,

46:12.337 --> 46:14.470
but there is something
beyond that.

46:28.419 --> 46:30.453
I know I act
as if I know everything,

46:30.455 --> 46:34.056
but allow me to ask
about your daughter again.

46:35.393 --> 46:39.195
My apologies. If you do not wish
to speak, I fully understand.

46:41.800 --> 46:45.334
I only took this assignment
because of my daughter.

46:45.336 --> 46:47.056
In what sense?

46:48.373 --> 46:50.139
I had to divert my thoughts.

46:50.141 --> 46:53.242
I had to be occupied
by something.

46:53.244 --> 46:57.146
I had to have a job
far out in the field.

46:57.148 --> 46:59.048
This makes me curious.

47:02.921 --> 47:04.487
My daughter has not been with me

47:04.489 --> 47:06.355
for four years now.

47:07.992 --> 47:09.712
Where is she?

47:10.862 --> 47:12.628
She is in Morocco.

47:12.630 --> 47:14.897
- Morocco?
- Yeah.

47:16.167 --> 47:18.935
She's with
her biological father.

47:20.538 --> 47:22.972
But I know that
you've never been married.

47:24.309 --> 47:26.976
Her father took her back
to his country...

47:28.880 --> 47:31.914
and he refuses to return her.

47:33.117 --> 47:34.951
I have sued ever since,

47:34.953 --> 47:38.487
but the Moroccan legal system
is very slow.

47:41.626 --> 47:43.326
I'm sorry to hear that.

47:45.597 --> 47:48.231
Having children invites tragedy.

47:50.401 --> 47:52.235
You have children?

48:01.746 --> 48:03.880
Are you afraid of something?

48:03.882 --> 48:05.448
Do I look like it?

48:05.450 --> 48:07.283
No. I apologize.

48:08.620 --> 48:11.587
I used to be afraid
as a little boy.

48:12.790 --> 48:15.558
Children who aren't afraid
scare me.

48:16.661 --> 48:21.664
A little boy who isn't afraid
would cease to be a boy.

48:21.666 --> 48:22.765
Hmm.

48:23.534 --> 48:26.369
I used to be afraid of the dark,

48:26.371 --> 48:27.870
but my grandmother told me

48:27.872 --> 48:30.339
something that stuck with me
ever since.

48:30.341 --> 48:31.774
She said,

48:31.776 --> 48:34.410
"It's okay to be afraid
of the dark,

48:34.412 --> 48:36.946
but the real tragedy in life...

48:36.948 --> 48:39.482
is when men
are afraid of the light."

49:50.221 --> 49:51.721
Get your bag.

49:52.557 --> 49:55.458
- Where are we going?
- Get it now.

50:03.601 --> 50:06.035
I demand to know
where we are going.

50:06.037 --> 50:07.370
Get in the car.

50:07.372 --> 50:10.840
No, I'm-I'm not leaving
without my colleagues.

50:10.842 --> 50:11.674
Where are they?

50:11.676 --> 50:13.976
Please do not embarrass me.

50:13.978 --> 50:16.445
Tell me what's happened
to Dr. Meier and Dr. Cavani.

50:16.447 --> 50:18.014
They are safe.

50:18.016 --> 50:19.949
- And me?
- You are not.

50:28.292 --> 50:30.726
I am your prisoner,
but as such, I would like to...

50:30.728 --> 50:33.496
As much as you are,
I am a prisoner myself...

50:33.498 --> 50:35.531
of my plans.

50:35.533 --> 50:37.400
There is no way back now.

51:49.307 --> 51:51.607
Where are we?

51:51.609 --> 51:53.776
Only a short distance
from the very place

51:53.778 --> 51:57.446
you traveled ten thousand miles
to see.

51:57.448 --> 51:58.714
Lake Diablo Blanco.

52:02.086 --> 52:04.120
Although these trains
were abandoned here

52:04.122 --> 52:05.754
a hundred years ago...

52:06.591 --> 52:08.591
time has
propelled them somewhere,

52:08.593 --> 52:11.026
maybe even into the future.

52:11.963 --> 52:14.330
Is there such a thing
as science fiction

52:14.332 --> 52:16.465
that looks back in time
instead of ahead?

52:16.467 --> 52:17.533
Certainly.

52:18.469 --> 52:21.170
See, these trains,
they never had a purpose.

52:21.172 --> 52:23.739
They had nothing to transport,
nowhere to go.

52:23.741 --> 52:25.374
Aliens must have left them here.

52:25.376 --> 52:27.042
Sure thing.

52:27.044 --> 52:28.744
Can I take a picture?

52:28.746 --> 52:31.580
Yes, as long as you keep my men
out of the frame.

52:31.582 --> 52:33.949
Please do it quickly,
we have to move on.

52:33.951 --> 52:36.652
- But the railroads...
- They are senseless.

52:36.654 --> 52:39.455
They only allow us to go
from where we already are

52:39.457 --> 52:41.357
to where we're no better off.

53:36.380 --> 53:38.047
This is Uturuncu.

53:38.916 --> 53:41.116
I thought it was important
you see it.

53:41.118 --> 53:43.485
Uturuncu. The dormant volcano?

53:44.455 --> 53:46.255
I know what your
field of study is, professor,

53:46.257 --> 53:48.324
but there is something
much bigger looming

53:48.326 --> 53:51.660
than the Diablo Blanco Disaster.

53:51.662 --> 53:54.230
The entire area of Uturuncu,

53:54.232 --> 53:56.498
thousands of square miles,

53:56.500 --> 53:58.334
is lifting,

53:58.336 --> 54:00.970
and the volcano itself
is rising and expanding

54:00.972 --> 54:04.807
all at a rate that exceeds
any previous measurements.

54:04.809 --> 54:07.209
In fact it is rising so rapidly

54:07.211 --> 54:09.044
that we
are experiencing permanent,

54:09.046 --> 54:10.980
round-the-clock tremors.

54:10.982 --> 54:12.848
And what could happen?

54:13.884 --> 54:16.518
You should ask
how fast it could happen.

54:17.755 --> 54:19.622
It might happen
in 200 thousand years,

54:19.624 --> 54:22.324
maybe in 20 thousand...

54:22.326 --> 54:24.126
or maybe in twenty.

54:25.763 --> 54:29.865
There's no point in asking
about nearby population.

54:29.867 --> 54:31.634
When Uturuncu erupts,

54:31.636 --> 54:35.938
our entire planet
will be obscured for decades.

54:35.940 --> 54:38.307
It won't matter if you live
in the Arctic,

54:38.309 --> 54:40.909
or the Himalayas, or Australia.

54:40.911 --> 54:43.679
We will disappear as a species.

54:44.749 --> 54:48.217
I am more concerned about
what we have created here.

54:48.219 --> 54:49.918
Here and now.

54:49.920 --> 54:54.023
A gigantic salt flat
that is expanding rapidly.

54:54.025 --> 54:55.824
So am I.

54:57.228 --> 55:02.431
But what may overtake it all
is the fire lying underneath.

55:04.468 --> 55:06.502
We must face both.

55:07.371 --> 55:09.705
Salt and fire.

55:12.343 --> 55:16.445
Here lies a monster,
on the verge of waking.

55:16.447 --> 55:17.980
My guess is one day soon

55:17.982 --> 55:22.551
everyone will know
how to pronounce Uturuncu...

55:22.553 --> 55:24.520
Uturuncu.

55:53.050 --> 55:54.850
<i>This is my goal.</i>

55:55.052 --> 55:56.785
To bring you here.

55:58.089 --> 56:01.423
But this is exactly where my
colleagues and I were heading.

56:01.425 --> 56:03.592
What's the point of all this?

56:38.729 --> 56:42.097
<i>I only had an abstract
idea how vast this is.</i>

56:42.099 --> 56:43.432
<i>Just numbers.</i>

56:43.434 --> 56:46.368
<i>The alarming thing is
the speed of its expansion.</i>

56:46.370 --> 56:48.771
<i>Almost 800 square miles
per year.</i>

56:49.707 --> 56:51.373
If it continues to grow,

56:51.375 --> 56:54.576
the salt will cover
the entire continent one day.

56:54.578 --> 56:56.111
I'm inclined to think
it could cover

56:56.113 --> 56:58.080
all land mass on the planet.

56:58.082 --> 56:59.615
Science Fiction.

56:59.617 --> 57:02.284
I'd love to think that way.

57:02.286 --> 57:03.519
Well, you know,
speaking of that,

57:03.521 --> 57:06.488
this is the ideal landing site
for aliens.

57:06.490 --> 57:10.459
Nothing on the planet
is so totally flat and so vast.

57:10.461 --> 57:12.027
Even our satellites use it

57:12.029 --> 57:14.663
to calibrate their distance
from the ground.

58:10.187 --> 58:12.821
- So, this is Incahuasi Island.
- Put it on the ground.

58:12.823 --> 58:14.189
Put it all down here.

58:14.191 --> 58:15.424
I know it from maps.

58:16.560 --> 58:19.862
I thought the world might see
the depth of this place

58:19.864 --> 58:21.763
if you experience something new.

58:23.167 --> 58:24.867
Meaning what?

58:25.703 --> 58:27.803
What are they doing over there?

58:28.539 --> 58:31.740
Hey!
- Drive! Go!

58:31.742 --> 58:34.376
Stop the car! Hey!

58:35.479 --> 58:37.012
Open the door!

58:37.014 --> 58:41.950
No, you can't leave me here!
Stop it!

58:41.952 --> 58:43.151
Hey!

58:44.021 --> 58:47.055
There are children there!
Are you mad?!

58:47.057 --> 58:51.093
Are you crazy?!
You left children behind!

58:51.095 --> 58:53.729
What am I supposed to do
with these kids?!

59:05.509 --> 59:08.110
Who are you?
Huh?

59:09.680 --> 59:12.147
Do you know why we are here?

59:12.149 --> 59:13.448
Who are you?

59:14.151 --> 59:16.051
Do you know those men?
Riley?

59:16.053 --> 59:17.286
Do you know Riley?

59:18.289 --> 59:21.423
Have you been here before?
You know this place?

59:21.425 --> 59:22.658
Huh?

59:24.595 --> 59:26.194
Can you see me?

59:27.598 --> 59:29.097
Can you see me?

59:29.633 --> 59:32.000
Do you understand me?

59:32.002 --> 59:33.702
Can you understand me?

59:33.704 --> 59:34.704
Huh?

59:36.974 --> 59:38.774
Who are you?

59:38.776 --> 59:41.410
I am Laura. Laura.

59:42.046 --> 59:44.546
And you?
What is your name?

59:46.283 --> 59:48.050
Laura.

59:48.552 --> 59:50.218
Your name.

59:50.220 --> 59:51.320
Huascar.

59:51.655 --> 59:52.788
Huascar.

59:52.790 --> 59:54.289
Huascar?

59:54.758 --> 59:56.692
And the other boy?

59:57.895 --> 01:00:00.162
The other boy?
Is he your brother?

01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:03.332
Huh?

01:00:03.334 --> 01:00:04.800
Laura.
- Laura.

01:00:04.802 --> 01:00:06.301
And what is your name?

01:00:06.303 --> 01:00:08.103
Atahuallpa.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:11.106
Ata-Atahuallpa?

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:13.108
Huascar. Laura.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.910
Are you brothers?

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:19.748
Huascar? Atahuallpa?
The royal Inca brothers?

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:23.819
Have you been here before?

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:27.289
Do you know this island?

01:00:30.194 --> 01:00:31.526
Hey.

01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:34.663
Do you know this island?

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:54.983
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:57.019
That's all the water we have.

01:01:16.473 --> 01:01:17.939
Come here.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.713
Smell.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:26.481
Onion.

01:01:28.052 --> 01:01:29.851
In your language?

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:32.988
Do you like onion?

01:01:38.495 --> 01:01:39.895
And now?

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:42.831
What do we do, huh?

01:01:48.338 --> 01:01:50.572
We have to build a camp.

01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:15.664
Let's do this together.

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.867
So, please, help me with this.

01:02:20.738 --> 01:02:22.170
Unroll it.

01:02:22.172 --> 01:02:23.638
Good.

01:02:25.509 --> 01:02:27.442
And now unfold.

01:02:28.679 --> 01:02:30.445
Very good.

01:02:30.447 --> 01:02:34.883
And... one, two... three.

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:36.384
Very good.

01:02:39.156 --> 01:02:40.822
Give me your hands.

01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:45.393
Hold this.
Hold. Okay?

01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:47.863
Hold still. Good boy.

01:02:49.967 --> 01:02:51.466
Good job.

01:02:52.503 --> 01:02:53.735
Thank you.

01:02:53.737 --> 01:02:56.404
I need your help, too. Okay?

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:57.539
Come with me.

01:02:59.676 --> 01:03:02.210
Atahuallpa, hold it, please.

01:03:03.814 --> 01:03:05.347
Stay here.

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:07.415
Stay here.

01:03:10.154 --> 01:03:11.653
Stay here, stay here.

01:03:11.655 --> 01:03:13.488
Don't move, don't move.

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.527
This is good now.

01:03:18.529 --> 01:03:20.162
Don't move.

01:03:33.377 --> 01:03:35.143
Good job.

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:37.445
Stand still. Good.

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:42.083
Now...

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:48.423
This is our home now.

01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:30.565
<i>All we have
is food for about a week.</i>

01:04:30.567 --> 01:04:32.734
<i>I worry about the water.</i>

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:35.837
<i>The salt absorbs
all the humidity.</i>

01:04:37.174 --> 01:04:40.008
<i>We have blankets, toilet paper,</i>

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:43.678
<i>kitchen utensils, and a stove.</i>

01:04:57.995 --> 01:05:01.630
<i>We are trapped here.
In a vast expanse of salt.</i>

01:05:01.632 --> 01:05:05.033
<i>No fences, no locked doors.</i>

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:10.805
<i>Getting away from the island
is impossible.</i>

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:12.440
<i>Returning to the shore</i>

01:05:12.442 --> 01:05:16.544
<i>would mean a three day trek
across salt.</i>

01:05:35.999 --> 01:05:38.300
Okay. Rice.

01:05:55.852 --> 01:05:57.519
How do you call it?

01:05:58.155 --> 01:05:59.220
Hm?

01:05:59.222 --> 01:06:01.189
<i>- Sal.
- Sal...</i>

01:06:01.191 --> 01:06:03.091
Salt.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.360
How about rice...

01:06:08.065 --> 01:06:09.864
and some of the dried fish?

01:06:09.866 --> 01:06:11.132
Hm?

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:13.768
Wow, you did a nice job
with the stove.

01:06:17.574 --> 01:06:18.840
So...

01:06:37.728 --> 01:06:39.627
- Laura.
- Yes?

01:06:39.629 --> 01:06:41.349
- Laura.
- Hm?

01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:46.368
Ah, I'm supposed to hold
my hand like this?

01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:49.537
Wow!

01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:51.339
Wow!

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:53.241
This is magic!

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:54.743
A magnet.

01:06:56.213 --> 01:06:57.612
Wonderful.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.836
<i>Considering the
circumstances, the night was good.</i>

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:38.573
One of the boys
talked in his sleep.

01:09:38.575 --> 01:09:41.209
Why are we stranded here?

01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:44.078
Why is Riley doing this to us?

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:47.148
How can we hold out?

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:02.163
Huascar.

01:10:06.937 --> 01:10:08.636
Ah, hm.

01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:10.605
Is it good?

01:10:10.607 --> 01:10:11.706
Hmm, yes.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:13.208
<i>Si.</i>

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:14.342
<i>Ja?</i>

01:10:14.344 --> 01:10:15.643
<i>Ja.</i>

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:18.780
Come here.

01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:29.624
Like it?

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.125
Hm?

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.163
Atahuallpa.

01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:37.599
Atahuallpa.

01:10:37.601 --> 01:10:40.401
Huascar. Huascar.

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:41.703
Come here.

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:48.443
It's good. Huh?

01:10:55.218 --> 01:10:56.818
Like it?

01:10:57.187 --> 01:10:58.219
Yeah?

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:00.355
Is it good?

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:19.807
We better save the water
for drinking.

01:11:23.246 --> 01:11:24.479
Come here.

01:11:33.089 --> 01:11:34.589
Huascar.

01:12:14.597 --> 01:12:16.464
Atahuallpa!

01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:19.167
Huascar!

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:21.936
Atahuallpa, you stay here.

01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:23.571
You stay here, okay?

01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:28.343
What are you doing?

01:12:28.345 --> 01:12:29.644
Hm?

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:34.148
You should hold
your brother's hand.

01:12:37.487 --> 01:12:40.221
Are you okay?
Give me your hand.

01:12:40.223 --> 01:12:41.389
Let's go.

01:12:42.125 --> 01:12:43.725
Good.
One step to your right.

01:12:43.727 --> 01:12:45.393
Big step there.

01:13:58.101 --> 01:14:00.034
Do you hear anything?

01:14:01.738 --> 01:14:03.171
Uturuncu.

01:14:12.549 --> 01:14:14.081
I can hear something.

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:17.785
Very distant.
Like a faint grumbling.

01:14:20.657 --> 01:14:22.723
The salt plain obviously behaves

01:14:22.725 --> 01:14:25.393
like a gigantic membrane.

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:31.866
Are we sitting on a fire
that is moving beneath us?

01:15:00.263 --> 01:15:03.164
My wish to have my scientific
instruments with me

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:04.899
is vanishing.

01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:07.969
The ocean of salt around me

01:15:07.971 --> 01:15:11.506
changes my way of seeing things.

01:15:11.508 --> 01:15:16.177
I find myself in a maze
of lines I do not comprehend.

01:15:17.714 --> 01:15:20.147
Just like an alien planet.

01:15:21.351 --> 01:15:23.718
<i>This is not of our world.</i>

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:49.670
<i>I wish the boys could see
what I see.</i>

01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:55.743
<i>If I stretched out my hands,
I could harvest the stars.</i>

01:17:02.685 --> 01:17:03.985
Good.

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:09.423
<i>Uno.</i>

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:11.425
Ooh!

01:17:13.363 --> 01:17:15.329
- Laura.
- Laura.

01:17:19.202 --> 01:17:21.602
Wow. Six.

01:17:22.705 --> 01:17:24.005
Oh!

01:17:24.007 --> 01:17:26.307
Feel. Feel.

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:28.209
Six.

01:17:28.911 --> 01:17:31.545
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

01:17:31.547 --> 01:17:33.114
Huascar.

01:17:41.057 --> 01:17:43.591
Wow!
<i>- Seis!</i>

01:17:44.894 --> 01:17:46.093
Feel it.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.633
Burry.

01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:04.812
<i>Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.</i>

01:18:06.315 --> 01:18:09.216
<i>Aqui. Cuatro.</i>

01:18:10.153 --> 01:18:13.521
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
<i>- Uno, dos, tres...</i>

01:18:13.523 --> 01:18:15.222
Oh, oh.

01:18:18.061 --> 01:18:19.727
Atahuallpa.

01:18:21.698 --> 01:18:23.164
Did you cheat?

01:18:23.599 --> 01:18:24.832
<i>Ja?</i>

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:28.302
You go back with this, huh?

01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:33.841
Four.

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:38.079
One, two, three, four.

01:18:38.948 --> 01:18:40.514
Huascar.

01:18:56.933 --> 01:18:59.467
Huascar, what did you do?

01:18:59.469 --> 01:19:00.469
Hm?

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.304
<i>- Si, Si.
- Ja, ja, ja, ja.</i>

01:19:05.007 --> 01:19:07.007
You like cheating, huh?
You like cheating.

01:19:07.009 --> 01:19:08.476
Si.

01:19:31.033 --> 01:19:32.433
Oh.

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:34.935
Congratulations.
- Laura.

01:19:44.147 --> 01:19:45.479
Come here.

01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:47.615
You are two cheaters!

01:19:47.617 --> 01:19:49.583
You are two cheaters.

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.754
I saw that you were
cheating on me.

01:19:53.756 --> 01:19:55.756
Is that true?

01:19:55.758 --> 01:19:57.124
Did you cheat on Laura?

01:19:57.126 --> 01:20:00.761
All the time you were
cheating on Laura, huh?

01:20:00.763 --> 01:20:03.264
You were cheating on me, you...

01:20:15.244 --> 01:20:16.544
Hm?

01:20:41.103 --> 01:20:44.705
I can't believe
it is already Tuesday.

01:20:44.707 --> 01:20:47.408
Time makes no sense anymore.

01:20:48.444 --> 01:20:51.679
Here I am, stranded
with two blind boys.

01:21:08.064 --> 01:21:13.200
<i>My former life has almost
completely disappeared.</i>

01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:15.603
<i>I feel that I'm changing.</i>

01:21:15.605 --> 01:21:18.505
<i>But how, I do not know.</i>

01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:59.546
No...

01:22:05.721 --> 01:22:06.854
No.

01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:29.743
<i>What if
nobody comes to our rescue?</i>

01:22:29.745 --> 01:22:33.480
<i>What do I tell the boys
when we run out of water?</i>

01:22:36.419 --> 01:22:40.487
<i>They are totally unaware
of the impending danger.</i>

01:24:25.961 --> 01:24:27.961
What are you doing?!

01:24:27.963 --> 01:24:29.797
There's such little water left!

01:24:29.799 --> 01:24:31.765
Hey!
What did you do, huh?!

01:24:31.767 --> 01:24:33.200
Hey!

01:24:36.405 --> 01:24:37.771
I'm sorry.

01:24:39.608 --> 01:24:41.208
Sorry, boys.

01:24:42.211 --> 01:24:43.644
I'm sorry.

01:25:42.738 --> 01:25:44.505
I hear nothing.

01:26:14.703 --> 01:26:15.869
Niños!

01:26:15.871 --> 01:26:17.204
Here I am!

01:26:17.907 --> 01:26:19.072
Here I am!

01:26:19.074 --> 01:26:20.541
My boys.

01:26:20.543 --> 01:26:22.376
Atahuallpa.
<i>- Hola, papa.</i>

01:26:22.378 --> 01:26:24.411
Huascar. Hey, hey.

01:26:24.413 --> 01:26:27.181
- Papa!
- Oh! Oh!

01:26:27.183 --> 01:26:29.850
Oh! Oh.

01:26:34.823 --> 01:26:35.923
Come closer.

01:26:36.892 --> 01:26:39.560
You are part of the family now,
so to speak.

01:26:41.263 --> 01:26:42.829
Are you kidding?

01:26:43.399 --> 01:26:44.998
Are you kidding me?

01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:57.344
Good to see you again,
Dr. Sommerfeld.

01:26:58.647 --> 01:27:01.114
Nice to see you again, Krauss.

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.653
I want an explanation.

01:27:08.224 --> 01:27:09.856
Accepted.

01:27:09.858 --> 01:27:11.258
And an apology.

01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:12.526
I will not apologize.

01:27:12.528 --> 01:27:13.860
I deserve an apology.

01:27:13.862 --> 01:27:17.030
You are with a man who is
accepting he is going to prison.

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:19.700
How are my companions

01:27:19.702 --> 01:27:22.469
you have so kindly kidnapped
and poisoned?

01:27:22.471 --> 01:27:24.504
They are in excellent shape...

01:27:25.741 --> 01:27:27.040
Professor.

01:27:27.643 --> 01:27:28.875
Thank God.

01:27:28.877 --> 01:27:32.412
Well, there is one grave
concern with Dr. Cavani.

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:34.348
He is grown slightly pale

01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:36.416
and needs to be sent
to a tanning salon.

01:27:40.656 --> 01:27:42.389
These boys...

01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:45.058
they are my sons.

01:27:47.129 --> 01:27:49.847
Their mother died

01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:52.566
shortly after she gave birth
to the younger one, Atahuallpa.

01:27:52.568 --> 01:27:55.669
She died because of the
toxicity of the environment

01:27:55.671 --> 01:27:57.638
around the town.

01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:00.073
She was a local woman
from Colchani.

01:28:01.143 --> 01:28:03.644
These boys are mine now.

01:28:03.646 --> 01:28:06.580
I adopted them
after their mother died.

01:28:08.884 --> 01:28:12.486
And in three years
they will be completely blind.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:17.057
Blind children have no stake
in any regime.

01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:24.398
What does it have to do with
my report on Diablo Blanco?

01:28:27.236 --> 01:28:29.903
This disaster is man-made.

01:28:30.673 --> 01:28:33.273
- Of course it is.
- No.

01:28:33.275 --> 01:28:34.941
Let me speak.

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.580
You see, I am the CEO
of the Consortium,

01:28:40.582 --> 01:28:43.350
which is responsible
for all of this.

01:28:44.787 --> 01:28:46.186
The toxins,

01:28:46.188 --> 01:28:48.155
the desiccation of the lake,

01:28:48.157 --> 01:28:52.025
the transformation
of a whole landscape...

01:28:52.027 --> 01:28:54.194
into salt.

01:28:56.565 --> 01:29:00.300
The failure of a "glorious"
irrigation system

01:29:00.302 --> 01:29:03.203
which diverted two large rivers.

01:29:04.573 --> 01:29:07.574
Both of which
are now beyond repair.

01:29:09.311 --> 01:29:11.945
And the salt here is expanding.

01:29:15.918 --> 01:29:17.918
There were fish here...

01:29:18.787 --> 01:29:23.190
a few decades ago.
Boats. Fishermen.

01:29:23.192 --> 01:29:25.125
Hard to imagine, isn't it?

01:29:25.961 --> 01:29:28.328
But I was prepared
to report on this.

01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:30.897
Why did you take me hostage?

01:29:30.899 --> 01:29:33.633
I wanted a report
back to the United Nations

01:29:33.635 --> 01:29:36.370
that contained something more
than scientific data,

01:29:36.372 --> 01:29:39.406
graphs and lifeless statistics.

01:29:40.442 --> 01:29:43.577
A report with
something different in it.

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:50.183
A report of a lake
so poisonous...

01:29:51.487 --> 01:29:55.322
that two boys who grew up
near its shores became blind!

01:29:59.328 --> 01:30:02.996
They will never see
a world like this again.

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:26.386
And now, before I turn myself
in to the authorities...

01:30:28.223 --> 01:30:30.724
please allow me two things.

01:30:37.599 --> 01:30:39.566
And this is number one.

01:30:42.738 --> 01:30:44.504
Number One.

01:30:46.842 --> 01:30:50.777
Laura, can I call you
by your first name?

01:30:50.779 --> 01:30:52.379
Of course.

01:30:53.615 --> 01:30:57.818
Please bring me...
your tablet...

01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:00.887
a toy, and a spoon.

01:31:02.458 --> 01:31:04.424
My tablet...

01:31:05.093 --> 01:31:07.227
a toy, and a spoon?

01:31:07.963 --> 01:31:09.429
Yes.

01:31:09.698 --> 01:31:11.164
Okay.

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:14.534
Okay, Laura,
take a step to the left.

01:31:14.536 --> 01:31:16.536
Tiny. Right. Good. Okay.

01:31:16.538 --> 01:31:18.839
Hold your arms up.

01:31:18.841 --> 01:31:20.707
Okay, now, elbows to hips.

01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:22.709
- Like that?
- Right, and your hands flat.

01:31:22.711 --> 01:31:24.711
Like this. Okay...

01:31:25.447 --> 01:31:29.082
One... two... three.

01:31:33.322 --> 01:31:35.055
Okay, crouch down.

01:31:35.057 --> 01:31:36.556
Crouch down.

01:31:36.558 --> 01:31:38.358
Okay, now hold still.

01:31:39.495 --> 01:31:41.575
Perfect, perfect.

01:31:42.764 --> 01:31:44.531
Laura, a little bit to the left.

01:31:44.533 --> 01:31:46.700
That's good, okay.

01:31:46.702 --> 01:31:48.935
Put your back foot up!

01:31:48.937 --> 01:31:50.637
Ah, that's good.

01:31:50.639 --> 01:31:51.872
Okay, scream!

01:31:56.512 --> 01:32:00.814
These photos will
keep me company in prison.

01:32:00.816 --> 01:32:03.116
That's why I wanted them,
you see.

01:32:05.821 --> 01:32:09.055
And here is the second thing
I wanted to do.

01:32:10.325 --> 01:32:12.259
- It's for me?
- Yes.

01:32:17.366 --> 01:32:19.533
A ticket to Rome?

01:32:19.535 --> 01:32:21.234
First class?

01:32:23.272 --> 01:32:26.239
Have you forgotten
Santissima Trinità?

01:32:28.243 --> 01:32:30.577
The saint under the tree?

01:32:31.813 --> 01:32:33.179
Right.

01:32:42.491 --> 01:32:45.258
But what if you do not
turn yourself in?

01:32:49.431 --> 01:32:51.298
I'll be caught anyway.

01:32:53.001 --> 01:32:56.436
Then go on the run...
to Rome.

01:32:56.438 --> 01:32:58.772
I guess that's where
I'm going to be.

01:33:07.816 --> 01:33:09.883
I don't know what to say.

01:33:14.389 --> 01:33:16.623
Why are you standing here?

01:33:16.625 --> 01:33:18.925
Book yourself a ticket.

01:33:21.263 --> 01:33:24.431
Guys, guys, I have
a premonition about this.

01:33:24.433 --> 01:33:26.967
We have to celebrate
with champagne.

01:33:26.969 --> 01:33:28.234
All that's missing

01:33:28.236 --> 01:33:31.137
are alien astronauts
from a faraway galaxy,

01:33:31.139 --> 01:33:32.706
traveling for centuries

01:33:32.708 --> 01:33:34.608
through the eternal darkness
of space.

01:33:34.610 --> 01:33:36.776
They see
this white heaven below,

01:33:36.778 --> 01:33:38.511
and they descended
their space craft

01:33:38.513 --> 01:33:41.615
with flickering lights
in a cloud of salt.

01:33:41.617 --> 01:33:42.949
Wonderful.

01:33:42.951 --> 01:33:45.418
But how do we attract them?

01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:48.154
We need some kind
of satellite transmission.

01:33:48.156 --> 01:33:49.623
Nonsense.

01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:51.825
The champagne will be the bait.
