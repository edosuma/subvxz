00:12.213 --> 00:13.714
Right now...

00:14.148 --> 00:17.651
...terrorists are plotting to
assassinate a presidential candidate.

00:17.952 --> 00:20.154
My teenage daughter is missing...

00:20.654 --> 00:24.658
...and people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.194
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.

00:27.394 --> 00:30.664
Today is going to be the
longest day of my life.

00:45.228 --> 00:47.981
Senator, stay with the
team until I secure the area.

00:48.181 --> 00:48.648
Fine.

00:48.848 --> 00:51.985
- Let's get him out.
- All right, we're on the move.

01:17.293 --> 01:19.512
Berkin, stay with the senator.

01:24.517 --> 01:27.020
- Hold on there.
- Sir, wait right here.

01:28.521 --> 01:30.523
Senator, we're clear. Let's go.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.535
Let's go!

01:49.542 --> 01:51.544
Let's go, inside.

01:57.550 --> 01:58.351
Frank Simes?

01:58.551 --> 01:59.952
- This is Bauer?
- Yes.

02:00.152 --> 02:01.354
You got to help me out.

02:01.554 --> 02:05.058
I understand you're obliged to follow
procedure, but please, hear me out.

02:05.258 --> 02:08.061
- I did this intentionally.
- That I believe.

02:08.261 --> 02:09.345
I didn't mean it like that.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.064
You called me at 6:30 this morning...

02:11.564 --> 02:14.067
...in order to get clearance to
bring a weapon into the breakfast.

02:14.183 --> 02:16.263
Exactly, If I wanted to shoot someone
I would have used my own gun.

02:16.347 --> 02:17.571
I didn't need his.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.374
What happened?

02:21.574 --> 02:24.077
I spotted him, walked over,
identified myself...

02:24.277 --> 02:26.379
...when I told him I had to take
him in, he went for my gun.

02:26.579 --> 02:29.582
I wasn't going for his gun. I created
a scene to get Palmer out of the room.

02:29.699 --> 02:30.695
If you wanted to get him out of the room,

02:30.728 --> 02:34.087
why didn't you just tell
us there was a problem?

02:34.287 --> 02:36.389
I can't tell you.
I have a restricted mandate.

02:36.589 --> 02:40.209
Cut the crap, Bauer. Your own people
called you in as a suspect.

02:40.409 --> 02:41.394
What?

02:41.594 --> 02:44.180
Tony Almeida from your office
called one of my men...

02:44.380 --> 02:45.682
...and told us you presented a threat.

02:45.882 --> 02:48.601
He doesn't have the same
information that I've got.

02:48.801 --> 02:49.903
Look, you guys are running out of time.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.439
You have a shooter disguised
as a photographer in here.

02:52.639 --> 02:56.609
He's escaped, he's still at large.
Palmer's life is still in danger.

03:01.114 --> 03:04.617
Frank, don't go. I've got to get
out of here. Come on!

03:06.285 --> 03:07.620
Get me Palmer's security.

03:08.121 --> 03:11.624
Work up a list of the photographers
we checked in this morning.

03:11.824 --> 03:13.126
Yeah, I'll wait.

03:19.632 --> 03:21.951
You sold classified information.

03:22.151 --> 03:24.270
People are dead because of you.

03:24.470 --> 03:28.641
The only chance you got of helping
yourself is by talking to us now.

03:29.642 --> 03:30.643
Jamey!

03:31.144 --> 03:33.646
The guy you work for, what's his name?

03:34.647 --> 03:36.649
I call him Gaines.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.952
I don't know if that's his real name.

03:39.152 --> 03:42.655
Do you have any idea where he
might be holding Teri and Kim?

03:45.658 --> 03:47.994
Jamey, stay with us here.

03:49.662 --> 03:51.664
I needed the money, that's all.

03:53.666 --> 03:55.168
I didn't think anyone would die.

03:55.334 --> 03:57.170
Yeah, well, they did.

03:57.670 --> 04:00.256
So you'd better get it together fast,
if you want to help yourself here.

04:00.673 --> 04:04.177
Is Gaines the one watching us
through our surveillance?

04:04.377 --> 04:06.179
And you set that up?

04:08.631 --> 04:11.534
OK, I can't do anything here.
I have to get on the floor.

04:11.734 --> 04:14.637
We can't cut their video off,
Gaines will get suspicious...

04:14.837 --> 04:16.606
...when he sees you walking around.

04:16.805 --> 04:18.690
I know what to say to him.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.998
- Did Jonathan get a shot off?
- He hasn't checked in!

04:25.198 --> 04:29.285
Find him, tell him to get over here.
I need to know what happened!

04:32.205 --> 04:34.207
What the hell is going on?

04:38.711 --> 04:39.862
Gaines.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.014
It's Jamey.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.882
Why are you using the phone?

04:43.082 --> 04:46.052
We're clear. I had to remove
our tap on the surveillance.

04:46.252 --> 04:47.520
What the hell is happening?

04:47.720 --> 04:50.623
You know that new engineer they
brought in, Milo Pressman?

04:50.823 --> 04:53.726
He was close to finding my entry
point to the surveillance.

04:53.926 --> 04:56.429
You said you could take care
of this for me, Jamey!

04:56.629 --> 04:57.530
And I did.

04:57.730 --> 05:00.233
I removed the tap.
You don't need it anymore.

05:00.433 --> 05:01.651
I'm just trying to protect you.

05:01.851 --> 05:04.737
You want to protect me? Get me Bauer!

05:04.937 --> 05:06.239
They're taking him to Division.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.742
Division? I've got to get him back!

05:09.942 --> 05:11.044
And you will.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.245
When? I need him now.

05:12.695 --> 05:15.122
And if that's not going to happen,
I will move on.

05:15.322 --> 05:17.750
Look, don't do anything
until I call over there...

05:18.251 --> 05:20.753
...and find out what's happening.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.755
All right, get back to me.

05:25.663 --> 05:28.363
He's not waiting around much longer.

05:28.563 --> 05:31.264
I'm going to work up the name Gaines.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.275
- Where've you been?
- I had to go out.

05:42.475 --> 05:43.076
Have you seen this?

05:43.276 --> 05:45.411
There was an incident with Palmer.

05:45.611 --> 05:47.580
We're working on it. What are you doing?

05:47.780 --> 05:50.083
Nothing. I'm waiting for
the key card from Tony.

05:50.283 --> 05:53.736
Forget about that. You're taking
over all of Jamey's projects.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.204
- Why?
- It doesn't matter.

05:55.404 --> 05:56.789
She's no longer on the team.

05:56.989 --> 05:57.790
Okay, fine, but...

05:58.207 --> 06:00.743
...if I'm gonna to take over an entire
department, I want a bump in pay.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.796
Just do it, Milo. You'll be taken care of.

06:10.803 --> 06:13.306
- That's all we have.
- All right, Mike.

06:13.506 --> 06:14.807
Call me the minute you find out.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.109
I will.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.111
What did he say?

06:18.311 --> 06:21.631
Just that they have someone in custody.
They don't know who.

06:21.831 --> 06:24.725
I don't know why you just didn't
listen to Secret Service...

06:24.925 --> 06:27.820
...the first time they told you
to just get out of there.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.622
Don't overreact.

06:29.822 --> 06:31.541
- Remember Annapolis?
- Yeah.

06:31.741 --> 06:34.827
When they pulled me out of the auditorium?

06:34.994 --> 06:36.629
But it turned out to be nothing.

06:36.829 --> 06:38.831
Yeah, well, it doesn't mean this is nothing.

06:39.332 --> 06:42.835
Oh, David, I really don't think we
should be taking chances today.

06:44.704 --> 06:48.141
I've been tracking this assassin since
midnight! 15 minutes ago he was here!

06:48.341 --> 06:50.435
I know what he looks like,
I can help you bring him down but,

06:50.535 --> 06:52.345
you've gotta let me get
in touch with my people!

06:52.545 --> 06:54.297
- Sit down, Bauer!
- Back off!

06:54.497 --> 06:56.349
Alan, it's okay. I got it.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.854
You're not helping yourself, here, Jack.

07:02.054 --> 07:04.140
I need to get back on this case.

07:04.340 --> 07:05.358
That's not going to happen.

07:05.858 --> 07:08.861
I have no choice but to
turn you over to the FBI.

07:13.866 --> 07:15.368
Can I speak to you off the record?

07:15.568 --> 07:16.169
No.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.371
We can talk on the record.

07:26.879 --> 07:30.683
I know you're a good agent, Bauer.
You wanna tell me what's going on here?

07:30.883 --> 07:34.388
If you ever repeat what I'm about
to tell you, I will deny it.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.887
You'll understand as soon as I explain.

07:37.724 --> 07:40.527
My wife and daughter are being held hostage.

07:40.727 --> 07:44.647
If I do not get myself out of this
situation, they will be killed.

07:45.231 --> 07:46.032
Who's holding them?

07:46.232 --> 07:47.734
Same people that want Palmer dead.

07:48.234 --> 07:49.736
They used me to smuggle
a weapon through security...

07:50.236 --> 07:52.321
...and put it in the hands of the assassin.

07:52.521 --> 07:53.781
Did you?

07:53.981 --> 07:55.241
Yes.

07:55.491 --> 07:57.268
I'm not sure you want me
to believe that, Jack.

07:57.468 --> 07:59.045
I had to. They were going to kill my family.

07:59.245 --> 08:02.247
But I got Palmer out of the room.
I saved his life.

08:02.447 --> 08:03.333
Look, Frank, I know this sounds crazy...

08:03.533 --> 08:04.535
...but you've got to believe me.

08:04.590 --> 08:06.836
Phone My house,
send a cruiser over to my house.

08:07.036 --> 08:10.706
My family is gone. They have been taken.
You have to let me go.

08:10.906 --> 08:12.592
If I can get back out there,
I can be the conduit...

08:12.792 --> 08:14.561
...to these people,
and I can bring them down.

08:14.761 --> 08:17.564
Even if I wanted to, I don't have
the authority to release you.

08:17.764 --> 08:21.267
I'll turn you over to District for a
debrief. Tell 'em what you've told me.

08:21.467 --> 08:24.470
Maybe they can help you
out of your situation.

08:27.273 --> 08:28.775
They won't.

08:29.058 --> 08:31.778
Alan, you and Mitchell take him down.

08:39.284 --> 08:41.087
Sorry, Jack.

08:41.287 --> 08:43.289
You will be if Palmer dies.

08:48.294 --> 08:49.796
I'll take him.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.218
Keep moving.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.808
Hold it, whoa.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.313
All right. Go ahead.

09:36.843 --> 09:38.453
Hold it right there!

09:38.653 --> 09:40.263
Get on the ground!

09:41.714 --> 09:43.349
Stay down!

09:46.185 --> 09:48.354
Don't shoot! It'll explode!

09:48.554 --> 09:49.656
Do not fire!

09:49.856 --> 09:51.357
We don't need an explosion here.

09:51.557 --> 09:52.358
Stay outside!

09:55.978 --> 09:56.863
Bauer!

10:01.868 --> 10:03.953
Get out of the way!

10:44.911 --> 10:47.413
- Open the passenger door!
- Don't shoot!

10:47.613 --> 10:49.916
Open the door! Don't panic!

10:49.999 --> 10:51.918
I don't want to hurt you.

10:52.118 --> 10:53.419
Don't hurt me!

10:55.922 --> 10:57.924
- Don't!
- Drive the car.

10:58.841 --> 11:00.426
Drive!

11:13.856 --> 11:15.358
Drive the car!

11:22.365 --> 11:24.367
Turn left in this driveway now.

11:24.567 --> 11:25.368
Okay.

11:36.879 --> 11:39.382
Make a right at the end of the parking lot.

11:39.582 --> 11:41.384
- Turn right!
- Okay.

11:43.886 --> 11:45.388
Damn it!

11:46.889 --> 11:48.391
Back it up.

11:50.393 --> 11:51.194
No, no, no.

11:51.394 --> 11:53.396
- Back up the other way.
- All right.

11:53.813 --> 11:54.897
Go forward.

11:55.281 --> 11:56.699
Go into the construction site.

11:56.899 --> 11:58.401
- Go.
- Okay.

12:01.904 --> 12:04.407
Slow down. Let this truck pass.

12:09.829 --> 12:12.415
Turn in there, through the gates.

12:14.417 --> 12:16.919
The parking spot on the left. Take it.

12:21.924 --> 12:25.811
Calm down. I just need to make one
phone call, and then I'll let you go.

12:26.011 --> 12:27.930
Put the car in park.

12:29.932 --> 12:31.934
Now, get out of the car.

12:40.443 --> 12:41.944
Please, get out of the car.

12:42.144 --> 12:43.946
Get out of the car.

12:44.146 --> 12:45.448
Come on.

12:51.454 --> 12:53.506
Get under the scaffolding.

13:03.466 --> 13:05.468
Up the stairs, quick. Go.

13:05.668 --> 13:06.469
Go.

13:10.973 --> 13:12.475
Open the door.

13:12.975 --> 13:13.976
It's locked.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.482
How could you do this?

13:20.483 --> 13:22.835
Betray your country?

13:23.035 --> 13:26.163
Be responsible for the death
of the people you work with?

13:26.363 --> 13:29.492
I told you, I didn't know any of that
was going to happen.

13:29.692 --> 13:30.293
Oh, that's right.

13:30.493 --> 13:33.496
You were just tapping on
your keyboard, right?

13:37.500 --> 13:39.502
How much they paying you?

13:40.503 --> 13:42.004
$1 million?

13:43.005 --> 13:44.006
$2 million?

13:46.509 --> 13:47.426
$300,000.

13:51.013 --> 13:53.415
You know, I could use $300,000 bucks.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.818
Everybody here could use some extra cash.

13:56.018 --> 13:58.571
I had a husband who left me and
my son with nothing.

13:58.771 --> 14:01.324
I had to do something.

14:01.524 --> 14:04.193
- And this is what you did?
- Yeah, that's right.

14:04.527 --> 14:08.164
I work twice as hard as anyone here
and I make half as much.

14:08.364 --> 14:09.832
Do you think that's fair?

14:10.032 --> 14:12.034
You didn't have to take the job.

14:13.035 --> 14:16.038
You don't know what kind
of pressure I'm under.

14:16.539 --> 14:17.206
Oh, yeah.

14:24.547 --> 14:27.049
I got Milo working on the name Gaines.

14:27.299 --> 14:28.551
What else has she given you?

14:29.051 --> 14:29.552
Excuses.

14:30.052 --> 14:31.854
We got to keep Gaines calm.

14:32.054 --> 14:35.057
Call and tell him that Jack's on his
way back to CTU from division.

14:35.558 --> 14:38.068
- Keep him on the phone as long as you...
- No!

14:38.268 --> 14:40.779
I'm not saying anything till I get immunity.

14:40.979 --> 14:43.064
In writing, signed by Chappelle.

14:51.289 --> 14:53.091
- Hello?
- ack!

14:53.291 --> 14:56.294
Thank God you're all right.
They wanted me to kill you.

14:56.494 --> 14:57.795
That's why I put the flak jacket on.

14:57.995 --> 14:59.297
I couldn't think of anything else.

14:59.714 --> 15:00.966
Why did they want me killed?

15:01.166 --> 15:04.803
Because you started piecing everything
together. Nina, I am so sorry.

15:05.003 --> 15:06.605
It's okay. I'm fine.

15:06.805 --> 15:08.807
What's happening with Teri and Kim?

15:09.808 --> 15:11.309
They're being held hostage.

15:11.810 --> 15:14.763
They said they would kill them if I
didn't help them take out Palmer.

15:14.963 --> 15:16.231
Where are you now?

15:16.815 --> 15:20.018
Secret Service had me in custody but
I just got away. Where are you?

15:20.318 --> 15:21.620
Back at CTU.

15:21.820 --> 15:24.272
They've tapped into surveillance.
Get out of sight

15:24.356 --> 15:27.826
We took care of it. We found their
inside person. It's Jamey.

15:28.026 --> 15:30.629
No, that's not possible. Walsh cleared her.

15:30.829 --> 15:34.332
We've got her right here.
She's already confessed.

15:35.834 --> 15:37.836
Oh, my God.

15:41.339 --> 15:43.041
Oh, my God.

15:43.341 --> 15:45.343
She had access to everything.

15:47.345 --> 15:49.347
Did she say anything about Teri or Kim?

15:49.848 --> 15:51.149
She doesn't know their location.

15:51.349 --> 15:52.851
She knows there's someone named Gaines.

15:53.351 --> 15:54.853
- What else?
- She's not cooperating.

15:54.969 --> 15:55.854
Not cooperating?

15:56.354 --> 15:58.356
She wants a letter of immunity
signed by Chappelle...

15:58.857 --> 15:59.858
...before she says anything else.

16:00.358 --> 16:01.159
Is she there?

16:01.359 --> 16:04.162
- Yeah.
- Put her on the phone.

16:04.362 --> 16:06.564
- Talk to him.
- I'm not going to talk to him.

16:06.764 --> 16:07.866
Jamey...

16:09.367 --> 16:10.535
She's listening.

16:10.735 --> 16:11.870
Jamey?

16:13.872 --> 16:15.173
Yeah?

16:15.373 --> 16:18.877
I know Nina and Tony don't understand
what you're going through right now.

16:19.377 --> 16:20.178
But you know me.

16:20.378 --> 16:23.248
I don't care about protocol
and I am true to my word.

16:23.448 --> 16:24.683
If you help me bring down Gaines...

16:24.883 --> 16:27.886
...and help me get my wife
and daughter back safely...

16:28.086 --> 16:30.388
...I promise you,
I will get you out of this.

16:30.889 --> 16:32.390
You don't have the power to do that.

16:32.590 --> 16:33.191
Of course I do.

16:33.391 --> 16:35.694
Right now only four of us know about this.

16:35.894 --> 16:39.397
I can take care of Nina and Tony.
I can get this done.

16:39.597 --> 16:42.400
- Jamey, please.
- No. You'll say anything.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.436
I want the immunity first.

16:50.024 --> 16:52.410
What do you want me to do, Jack?

16:56.414 --> 16:57.916
She has a son named Kyle.

16:59.417 --> 17:00.418
Bring him in.

17:00.869 --> 17:03.046
No, wait a minute, Jack, you can't do that.

17:03.246 --> 17:05.423
- You got to be careful.
- I also need a car.

17:05.924 --> 17:07.726
Put a CTU com unit in it...

17:07.925 --> 17:11.045
...a box of 9 mm ammunition,
a locksmith kit, the whole package.

17:11.429 --> 17:12.731
And then?

17:12.931 --> 17:15.717
I'm going to get myself out of this.
I'm going to go find Teri and Kim.

17:15.916 --> 17:17.935
Where do you want the car?

17:18.936 --> 17:21.439
The corner of Temple and Mercer.

17:21.638 --> 17:22.523
Okay.

17:23.441 --> 17:24.943
Thank you.

17:25.143 --> 17:25.854
Bye.

17:32.450 --> 17:35.837
Who are you? What's going on?

17:36.037 --> 17:39.899
A few hours ago, someone kidnapped
my wife and daughter.

17:40.099 --> 17:43.962
I don't get it then. Why are you
running from the police?

17:44.462 --> 17:46.464
What's your name? Lauren?

17:51.469 --> 17:52.971
I'm Jack.

17:53.087 --> 17:55.190
I work for a special branch
of the government.

17:55.390 --> 17:58.835
Last night, I was given a very
important assignment.

17:59.035 --> 18:02.480
Right now someone is trying to
stop me from doing it.

18:07.485 --> 18:09.988
You don't believe me, do you?

18:12.991 --> 18:15.894
If I were you I wouldn't
believe me either.

18:16.094 --> 18:18.997
What I want to know is
why do you have me here?

18:19.197 --> 18:21.299
You got a car, you got a place to hide.

18:21.499 --> 18:24.302
I can't afford to be
taken back into custody.

18:24.502 --> 18:26.632
If they get close enough,
I have to make them believe...

18:26.670 --> 18:29.507
I'm willing to do something really crazy.

18:30.508 --> 18:32.010
Like shoot me?

18:36.014 --> 18:38.516
I'm not gonna shoot you.

18:44.022 --> 18:45.523
You know something?

18:46.524 --> 18:48.526
I think I believe you.

18:50.528 --> 18:51.329
What are you doing?

18:51.529 --> 18:53.331
You're not the only one
who has problems, Jack.

18:53.531 --> 18:56.451
You know, I just came off
of a hellacious night shift.

18:56.651 --> 18:58.503
I'm due in court in 45 minutes...

18:58.703 --> 19:01.539
...on a DUI charge of which I'm guilty.

19:02.540 --> 19:05.043
So, you know, good luck
with your crisis, okay?

19:08.546 --> 19:12.550
Lauren, I have killed two
people since midnight.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.769
I have not slept for over 24 hours.

19:14.969 --> 19:18.556
So, maybe... maybe you should be
a little more afraid...

19:18.756 --> 19:20.842
...of me than you are right now.

19:23.561 --> 19:24.562
Sit.

19:42.430 --> 19:43.381
Are you okay?

19:43.931 --> 19:45.875
Everything's all right.
No need to worry.

19:46.075 --> 19:48.019
We heard there was someone with a gun?

19:48.219 --> 19:50.738
It's not clear what happened.

19:50.938 --> 19:53.941
I'm afraid I'm intact and
as grouchy as ever.

19:54.141 --> 19:56.477
So, folks, let's all get back to work.

19:57.278 --> 19:58.746
Where's Keith?

19:58.946 --> 20:00.448
He left about a half-hour ago.

20:00.815 --> 20:02.667
- Did he say where?
- No.

20:02.867 --> 20:04.452
Look, I'm a little worried about him.

20:04.736 --> 20:05.787
Why?

20:05.987 --> 20:08.956
He wasn't being himself. He stormed
out like he was angry.

20:09.457 --> 20:10.958
I'm sure he'll be all right, Anna, thanks.

20:11.459 --> 20:12.460
Okay.

20:14.962 --> 20:17.965
Should we send someone after him?

20:18.165 --> 20:20.468
No, he's okay.

20:20.968 --> 20:22.970
He just needs some time alone.

20:27.975 --> 20:29.977
I'll call Secret Service.

20:30.978 --> 20:32.780
David...

20:32.980 --> 20:36.984
I know how you feel about telling
our side of the story first.

20:37.184 --> 20:39.237
But right now there is no time for that.

20:39.487 --> 20:41.489
Maureen is gonna go on air at 9:00.

20:41.656 --> 20:44.792
That's 40 minutes from right now.

20:44.992 --> 20:47.995
Isn't there anything we can do to stop her?

20:48.195 --> 20:49.497
She won't budge.

20:50.998 --> 20:52.300
And why would she?

20:52.500 --> 20:55.503
"Candidate's son faces murder charges."

20:55.703 --> 20:57.146
"Cover-up suspected."

20:57.346 --> 20:58.790
It's a huge story.

20:59.340 --> 21:03.544
I cannot believe you are just going to
accept this without putting up a fight.

21:03.744 --> 21:05.313
There's nothing to fight.

21:05.513 --> 21:08.015
In fact, it doesn't matter who
breaks the story, me or Maureen.

21:08.215 --> 21:10.351
We're just going to have to
deal with it and get past it.

21:10.551 --> 21:12.453
I've seen you do the impossible
for your career.

21:12.653 --> 21:14.555
I'm just asking you now
to do it for your son.

21:14.755 --> 21:16.324
No.

21:16.524 --> 21:19.026
You're asking me to rewrite history.

21:19.527 --> 21:23.531
If you wanted my help, you would've
asked me for it seven years ago.

21:23.731 --> 21:26.033
Oh, for crying out loud, David.

21:28.536 --> 21:31.038
I need today's schedule in my office.

21:31.238 --> 21:32.540
Yes, sir, right away.

21:38.295 --> 21:38.846
Almeida.

21:39.046 --> 21:40.381
Tony, it's Jack. Where's Nina?

21:40.581 --> 21:43.801
She's on the floor working up some
information we got from Jamey.

21:44.001 --> 21:45.752
- Is Kyle there yet?
- Not yet.

21:45.836 --> 21:47.104
What about the car?

21:47.304 --> 21:49.306
Nina sent it. It should
be there in 10 minutes.

21:49.807 --> 21:51.258
Good. Anything else from Jamey?

21:51.458 --> 21:53.394
Nothing useful, no.

21:53.594 --> 21:56.814
Tony, Secret Service told me
you were the one who called...

21:57.014 --> 21:58.649
...and told them to take me out of play.

21:58.849 --> 22:01.535
Yeah. I felt I had to, Jack.

22:01.735 --> 22:04.680
Given the information you had,
I think you made the right choice.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.825
I didn't realize what you were
going through earlier tonight.

22:08.325 --> 22:10.327
The last thing you needed
was me giving you attitude.

22:10.527 --> 22:12.129
I appreciate that.

22:12.329 --> 22:14.832
I wish I knew earlier who
I could trust.

22:15.332 --> 22:18.335
I'm just really glad you were there
when Nina came back to CTU.

22:18.535 --> 22:19.837
Yeah.

22:20.838 --> 22:22.840
I'll call you when I get to the car.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.592
- Talk to you later.
- Bye.

22:25.792 --> 22:28.345
Lauren, come here to the window.

22:32.850 --> 22:35.352
See that tool down there,
looks like a hedge trimmer?

22:35.853 --> 22:39.356
- What, the bolt cutters?
- Yes, the bolt cutters.

22:39.556 --> 22:41.859
Could you get them for me, please?

22:43.360 --> 22:44.862
Hey.

22:45.229 --> 22:47.364
I'll be watching you.

23:28.405 --> 23:30.207
Good.

23:30.407 --> 23:32.910
You're gonna do it with a burst.
Give it everything you got.

23:33.410 --> 23:35.412
I know how to use bolt cutters.

23:39.917 --> 23:40.751
Good.

23:49.426 --> 23:51.929
That was Frank Simes
from the Secret Service.

23:52.429 --> 23:53.230
What are you doing?

23:53.430 --> 23:55.065
Pouring myself a drink, Mike.

23:55.265 --> 23:57.935
It's not even 9:00 in the morning.

23:58.135 --> 23:59.236
What did Simes say?

23:59.436 --> 24:02.940
The CTU agent who created the disturbance
at the power plant...

24:03.140 --> 24:05.242
...was named Jack Bauer.

24:05.442 --> 24:08.812
He tried to take the gun off one of the
Secret Service agents...

24:09.012 --> 24:11.949
...but claimed the gesture
was misinterpreted.

24:12.149 --> 24:14.251
Maybe it was.

24:14.451 --> 24:18.822
As Bauer was being taken into
custody, he escaped.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.457
How the hell did he do that?

24:20.657 --> 24:21.675
I don't know...

24:21.875 --> 24:24.962
...but they haven't found
him yet. He's still out there.

24:25.462 --> 24:27.998
Jack Bauer...

24:28.465 --> 24:29.466
You know him?

24:30.467 --> 24:32.419
I've heard the name.

24:47.985 --> 24:48.935
Get up.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.289
What are you doing?

24:52.489 --> 24:54.491
Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt her.

24:55.993 --> 24:57.494
Get up and go in the other room.

24:57.995 --> 24:59.997
Don't you even think about touching her.

25:00.197 --> 25:01.498
Move it!

25:02.916 --> 25:03.801
Don't touch her!

25:04.001 --> 25:06.003
You stay out of this or I will hurt her.

25:06.203 --> 25:07.454
Come on.

25:17.014 --> 25:18.682
No! Get away!

25:19.800 --> 25:21.268
Shut up!

25:22.019 --> 25:23.020
Hey.

25:25.022 --> 25:26.523
I won't fight you.

25:34.531 --> 25:35.649
Mom?

25:36.033 --> 25:38.402
It's going to be all right, honey.

25:42.039 --> 25:43.040
Come on.

25:46.043 --> 25:48.045
- Come on.
- All right.

25:49.046 --> 25:50.330
Fine.

26:10.567 --> 26:11.568
Mom!

26:57.914 --> 26:59.416
Maureen Kingsley.

26:59.916 --> 27:00.917
Thanks.

27:04.421 --> 27:06.423
Maureen, hi. Thanks for getting back to me.

27:06.923 --> 27:09.926
I'm about to go on the air, Sherry.
What's up?

27:10.126 --> 27:12.229
- Don't go with the story.
- Excuse me?

27:12.429 --> 27:15.932
The story about Keith. Just leave it
alone for right now.

27:16.933 --> 27:18.235
Hold on, please.

27:18.435 --> 27:20.937
Can you give me one minute? Thanks.

27:25.942 --> 27:29.946
The story about Keith is exclusive
and it's documented.

27:30.146 --> 27:32.549
I'm not making false allegations
about your son.

27:32.749 --> 27:36.453
There was an assassination attempt
this morning on my husband.

27:37.454 --> 27:39.456
But it's being covered up.

27:41.458 --> 27:42.759
Go on.

27:42.959 --> 27:45.929
The man they arrested works
for the government...

27:46.129 --> 27:48.465
...and he may not have been acting alone.

27:49.966 --> 27:52.368
Are you telling me there's a conspiracy...

27:52.568 --> 27:54.771
...inside the government
to kill your husband?

27:54.971 --> 27:58.441
I'm telling you something's going on
that hasn't been reported...

27:58.525 --> 28:01.978
...and if you give me a couple of hours...

28:02.178 --> 28:04.481
...I'll milk some of my sources.

28:05.482 --> 28:08.485
Okay, I won't kill the story about Keith.

28:08.685 --> 28:11.488
I'm not asking you to. Just...

28:11.988 --> 28:14.491
Hold off on it for a couple of days.

28:24.501 --> 28:25.802
- Mom?
- Kim.

28:26.002 --> 28:27.504
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

28:28.004 --> 28:29.890
No. It's okay, honey.

28:30.507 --> 28:32.509
If I hadn't snuck out
this wouldn't have happened.

28:32.709 --> 28:34.511
Kimberly, listen to me.

28:36.013 --> 28:38.165
We are going to get through this.

28:38.365 --> 28:40.317
We're gonna be a family again.

28:40.517 --> 28:43.520
You and me and Dad are gonna
have our lives back.

28:48.025 --> 28:52.029
This isn't gonna be a part of that life.
Understand what I'm saying?

28:53.530 --> 28:55.032
You're not gonna tell Dad?

29:01.421 --> 29:03.540
Where did you get that?

29:06.543 --> 29:09.046
- CTU. Myers.
- Nina, listen, it's Teri.

29:09.212 --> 29:10.547
Teri. Where are you?

29:13.550 --> 29:15.552
Hello? Teri?

29:17.187 --> 29:18.555
Hello, Teri?

29:22.059 --> 29:23.961
The number's blocked.

29:24.161 --> 29:26.063
Stand in that corner.

30:15.612 --> 30:17.915
No, I don't want to go on
with the governor.

30:18.115 --> 30:21.118
Put him on first. If he's got a
problem, have him talk to Mike.

30:21.318 --> 30:23.120
It looks like he's introducing you.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.372
Well, good. I want it to look that way.

30:25.572 --> 30:27.624
- Okay.
- Dave, I'll talk to you later.

30:32.129 --> 30:33.130
Where'd you go?

30:33.630 --> 30:34.932
I just went out.

30:35.132 --> 30:37.634
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

30:41.138 --> 30:43.523
You didn't tell the press about me.

30:43.723 --> 30:46.109
It's going to come out soon anyway.

30:46.193 --> 30:47.644
Look, I talked to my lawyer...

30:48.145 --> 30:50.647
...and he's got his best
people working on it.

30:51.148 --> 30:54.201
- "His best people," right.
- Keith, don't be this way.

30:54.401 --> 30:55.953
You're going to be cleared...

30:56.153 --> 30:59.656
...then you're going to get on with
your life without it hanging over you.

31:01.158 --> 31:02.159
Sure.

31:02.659 --> 31:04.962
You ready to go?

31:05.162 --> 31:07.564
Kingsley's gonna break the story
in about ten minutes.

31:07.764 --> 31:10.167
- Have we prepared something?
- No longer necessary.

31:10.367 --> 31:11.468
What do you mean?

31:11.668 --> 31:15.672
I just got off the phone with Kingsley.
She's going to sit on the story for now.

31:17.174 --> 31:18.308
Why would she do that?

31:18.508 --> 31:21.678
Don't know, she didn't say.
Maybe you got through to her.

31:21.878 --> 31:22.980
No, I didn't.

31:23.180 --> 31:24.681
It's something else.

31:27.684 --> 31:28.685
Ready?

31:29.186 --> 31:32.656
Maureen Kingsley's decided to hold
off on the story for some reason.

31:32.856 --> 31:34.191
Thank God, David.

31:34.691 --> 31:36.493
Have any idea why she'd do that?

31:36.693 --> 31:39.696
No. Maybe her sources weren't as solid...

31:40.197 --> 31:42.199
...as she said they were?

31:44.701 --> 31:46.703
What? Aren't you relieved?

31:47.704 --> 31:49.206
I want to talk to her.

31:49.706 --> 31:51.208
After she gets off the air, I'll call her.

31:51.708 --> 31:54.211
Don't you think that it's
smarter just to let things be?

31:54.411 --> 31:56.713
I think it's smarter to know
everybody's motives.

31:56.913 --> 31:58.715
Come on. Let's go.

31:58.915 --> 31:59.716
Come on.

32:14.731 --> 32:16.033
Where do you work?

32:16.233 --> 32:18.535
Cable's Coffee Shop on Ventura.

32:18.735 --> 32:22.239
Home of the $3.99 all-day breakfast.

32:24.241 --> 32:25.742
You married?

32:26.243 --> 32:28.045
I used to be.

32:28.245 --> 32:30.247
But my sister moved in with us...

32:30.747 --> 32:32.749
...after she got in a really
bad car accident.

32:32.949 --> 32:34.751
She couldn't take care of herself.

32:35.252 --> 32:37.754
My husband Henry told me I had to choose.

32:37.954 --> 32:39.756
You chose the sister.

32:39.956 --> 32:41.258
Yep.

32:42.259 --> 32:45.262
- This your first DUI?
- First in a couple years.

32:47.264 --> 32:50.267
- You got a problem?
- What, a drinking problem?

32:51.768 --> 32:55.772
I wish it were that simple. At least
then I'd have a support group.

32:58.275 --> 33:01.745
Nope. What I'm afraid
all I have is bad luck.

33:05.282 --> 33:08.285
Sorry I had to get you involved in all this.

33:08.485 --> 33:09.786
Just let me go.

33:11.788 --> 33:13.790
As soon as I get my car.

33:17.294 --> 33:19.296
As soon as I get my car.

33:21.798 --> 33:24.451
I used to be in the military.

33:24.651 --> 33:27.304
Used to do fieldwork for the CIA.

33:28.805 --> 33:31.308
I've been to some horrible places.

33:32.309 --> 33:35.312
I've seen some pretty terrible things.

33:37.314 --> 33:41.318
I don't think I've ever been
this scared in my whole life.

34:46.232 --> 34:50.737
No, I told you, I'm not saying any more
until I get counsel.

34:50.937 --> 34:51.871
I think you will.

34:52.072 --> 34:54.040
Why do you think that?

34:54.239 --> 34:56.743
'Cause we're bringing Kyle here.

34:57.243 --> 34:58.244
What?

35:00.797 --> 35:03.550
I'll kill you if you touch my son.

35:03.750 --> 35:06.586
We're not going to lay
a finger on him.

35:06.753 --> 35:09.255
If you don't give us something
to help us find Gaines...

35:09.455 --> 35:11.257
...we have no choice but to bring him here.

35:11.457 --> 35:13.259
No. You won't.

35:15.261 --> 35:16.763
We will, Jamey.

35:18.264 --> 35:20.666
Imagine the effect it'll have on him...

35:20.866 --> 35:23.269
...seeing his mother in restraints.

35:23.770 --> 35:28.074
- Arrested for being a traitor.
- No. This is not fair.

35:28.274 --> 35:32.278
That's a picture he's going to carry
with him the rest of his life.

35:35.782 --> 35:36.783
Nina...

35:38.284 --> 35:39.786
Please...

35:41.287 --> 35:44.290
Don't do this. Kyle can't see
me like this. Please, Nina.

35:44.490 --> 35:45.475
He doesn't have to.

35:45.675 --> 35:48.177
You just have to start talking to us.

35:48.377 --> 35:50.847
The bottom line is, Jamey...

35:51.047 --> 35:53.182
...the best thing you can do for your son...

35:53.382 --> 35:55.184
...is to help us get Gaines now.

35:55.384 --> 35:56.486
Why?

35:56.686 --> 35:58.988
Once we have you in custody...

35:59.188 --> 36:02.692
...Gaines is going to do anything
he can to keep you from testifying.

36:03.192 --> 36:06.696
And if he can't get to you directly,
where's he going next?

36:06.896 --> 36:08.698
Your son, right?

36:12.201 --> 36:13.703
Kyle...

36:35.224 --> 36:36.726
I'm just so...

36:38.728 --> 36:40.229
...confused.

36:40.730 --> 36:42.732
I need time to think.

36:46.235 --> 36:48.237
Take a couple minutes.

37:09.258 --> 37:12.261
I'm in big trouble here
and I need your help, please.

37:12.461 --> 37:13.563
I've got to get to a car.

37:13.763 --> 37:16.265
I step out of this trailer
they'll take me into custody.

37:16.465 --> 37:17.567
You want me to pick it up?

37:17.767 --> 37:21.137
Yes, and bring it back here. I need
you to park it around the side.

37:21.337 --> 37:23.573
Why didn't you have your
friend drop it off here...

37:23.773 --> 37:26.776
Complicated. The person dropping
off the car was following orders.

37:26.976 --> 37:28.911
He couldn't know it was for me.

37:29.111 --> 37:31.280
Do you realize how insane this sounds?

37:31.480 --> 37:32.782
Yes, I do.

37:42.074 --> 37:46.311
Okay, let's just say for the
sake of argument I believe half of it.

37:46.511 --> 37:50.749
Just tell me one thing. Is your wife
and daughter really in trouble?

37:51.801 --> 37:53.302
Yes, they are.

37:56.806 --> 37:57.807
All right.

37:59.308 --> 38:00.610
Where's the car?

38:00.810 --> 38:04.313
Over on the corner of Temple and Mercer.
Silver sedan, government plates.

38:04.513 --> 38:06.315
The keys'll be in it.

38:36.846 --> 38:38.748
Keep going, Lauren.

38:38.948 --> 38:40.850
Keep going, come on.

38:46.105 --> 38:47.356
No.

38:47.857 --> 38:48.858
No.

38:52.361 --> 38:53.863
- No!
- Excuse me!

38:54.363 --> 38:55.397
Damn it!

39:11.380 --> 39:14.183
He's out the window! I see him!

39:14.383 --> 39:16.886
All right, this is Hayes.
I got a 20 on Bauer.

39:49.034 --> 39:50.219
What have you got?

39:50.419 --> 39:54.039
I tried Gaines under many spellings
and I came up with a long list...

39:54.239 --> 39:57.426
...of those with records and those
with criminal associations.

39:57.626 --> 39:59.929
Crosscheck it with everything
else we've gotten tonight.

40:00.129 --> 40:01.931
Plane crash, Alan York, Penticoff.

40:02.932 --> 40:05.234
Got it.

40:05.434 --> 40:07.269
She's had enough time to think about it.

40:07.937 --> 40:08.437
Yeah.

40:12.942 --> 40:16.946
Jamey's son Kyle is being brought in.
Call me in ITS when he gets here.

40:17.146 --> 40:17.947
Wait.

40:18.447 --> 40:19.949
What kind of trouble is she in?

40:20.149 --> 40:21.751
No trouble.

40:21.951 --> 40:25.104
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
You told me to take over her stuff

40:25.304 --> 40:28.457
You don't tell me you're gone.
Now you're bringing her son in?

40:28.657 --> 40:29.759
She's in trouble...

40:29.959 --> 40:32.762
Milo, you're not an Internal Affairs agent

40:32.962 --> 40:35.965
Keep quiet, call us when
Kyle gets here, okay?

40:37.466 --> 40:38.768
He's going to figure it out.

40:38.968 --> 40:40.970
It's not going to be a
secret much longer, anyway.

40:41.470 --> 40:43.973
You're right, we'll bring Milo in
because what Jamey gives...

40:44.173 --> 40:45.975
...he'll be the one to work it up.

40:46.475 --> 40:47.977
I hope it's something substantial.

40:48.477 --> 40:48.978
Yeah.

40:50.980 --> 40:52.982
Oh, my God!

40:53.098 --> 40:54.900
- Get her out of those!
- Jamey!

40:55.100 --> 40:55.985
What's the number!

40:59.488 --> 41:01.991
- C'mon, now.
- We need medical help.

41:02.191 --> 41:03.826
Yes. We're in ITS.

41:04.693 --> 41:05.995
Hurry!

41:06.495 --> 41:07.997
Grab herlegs.

41:10.332 --> 41:11.567
Watch her head.

41:11.767 --> 41:13.002
What have you done?

41:17.956 --> 41:19.308
What?

41:19.508 --> 41:21.510
It's Milo. Jamey's son
just arrived. Bring him in?

41:21.710 --> 41:23.512
No. Keep him out of here.

41:58.047 --> 41:59.048
Gaines!
