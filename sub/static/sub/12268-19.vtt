WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:02.533
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.533 --> 00:04.175
(Nolan) THE FALC0N IS BACK
ON THE GRAYSONS' PAYROLL.

00:04.175 --> 00:06.077
THEN LET'S GO HUNTING.

00:06.077 --> 00:08.439
COULD IT BE THAT YOU'VE LIED
ABOUT THE PREGNANCY

00:08.439 --> 00:09.610
YOU CLAIM TO HAVE TERMINATED?

00:09.610 --> 00:12.243
YOU WANT PROOF?
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.

00:12.243 --> 00:14.345
I THINK THAT WE'RE IN THIS
FOR THE SAME THING--

00:14.345 --> 00:17.248
TO GET WHAT WE CAN FROM CONRAD
BEFORE WE TAKE HIM DOWN.

00:17.248 --> 00:18.519
SO YOU WITH ME?

00:18.519 --> 00:21.292
I BUMPED INTO EMILY
ON MY WAY IN,

00:21.292 --> 00:22.453
AND NATURALLY I INFERRED THAT
YOU TWO HAD GOT BACK TOGETHER,

00:22.453 --> 00:23.594
WHICH SHE CONFIRMED.

00:23.594 --> 00:25.326
I HOPE THIS ISN'T TOO AWKWARD
FOR YOU.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.398
NO. ALL IS FAIR IN
LOVE AND WAR, AS THEY SAY.

00:27.398 --> 00:28.529
(gasping)

00:28.529 --> 00:31.262
(Declan) CHARLOTTE!
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

00:31.262 --> 00:32.302
YOU OKAY?

00:32.302 --> 00:33.434
(choking)

00:33.434 --> 00:35.606
THIS IS FOR PADMA

00:35.606 --> 00:37.338
AND COLLEEN.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.409
(neck snaps, thud)

00:38.409 --> 00:39.540
WHAT HAPPENED WITH TRASK?

00:39.540 --> 00:41.242
HE KILLED PADMA.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.577
DESTROYING EVIDENCE?

00:46.577 --> 00:49.580
I'M NOT SAYING A WORD.

00:53.324 --> 00:54.585
(Emily)
 A PERSON'S TRUE IDENTITY

00:54.585 --> 00:57.488
CAN OFTEN BE DIFFICULT
 TO DISCERN...

00:57.488 --> 01:01.632
EVEN TO THEMSELVES,

01:01.632 --> 01:03.594
'CAUSING ONE TO QUESTION
 THEIR CHARACTER...

01:03.594 --> 01:05.596
THEIR CALLING...

01:05.596 --> 01:09.500
THEIR VERY EXISTENCE.

01:09.500 --> 01:12.273
FOR MOST,
 TIME PROVIDES CLARITY.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.375
BUT FOR OTHERS...

01:14.375 --> 01:17.548
THESE QUESTIONS
 REMAIN UNANSWERED...

01:17.548 --> 01:21.512
FOR AN IDENTITY
 CANNOT BE FULLY DEFINED...

01:21.512 --> 01:23.454
WHEN IT IS A GUARDED SECRET.

01:23.454 --> 01:25.456
(gasps)

01:25.456 --> 01:28.389
YOU KNOW, I'VE EVEN MISSED
YOUR MYSTERIOUS EXITS.

01:28.389 --> 01:29.590
I DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOU.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.262
I HAVEN'T SLEPT THIS WELL

01:31.262 --> 01:32.393
SINCE THERE WAS
A RING ON YOUR HAND.

01:33.564 --> 01:36.327
HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF,

01:36.327 --> 01:37.468
JUST LIKE US.

01:37.468 --> 01:38.729
MM.

01:38.729 --> 01:42.273
SO I MADE RESERVATIONS
AT LA BERNADIER FOR LUNCH.

01:42.273 --> 01:43.334
OH.

01:43.334 --> 01:44.705
I GOT THAT TABLE YOU LIKE.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.507
WE DON'T HAVE TO HIDE THE FACT
THAT WE'RE DATING ANYMORE.

01:46.507 --> 01:50.311
MIGHT AS WELL GO ON
A FEW ACTUAL DATES.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.442
EMS?

01:51.442 --> 01:52.583
YOU THERE?

01:52.583 --> 01:55.416
SORRY. I WAS...
UP WORRYING ABOUT NOLAN.

01:55.416 --> 01:58.449
THE POLICE WERE
QUESTIONING HIM ALL NIGHT.

01:58.449 --> 02:00.451
BUT THEY DIDN'T CHARGE HIM?

02:00.451 --> 02:02.453
THAT'S BECAUSE
HE DIDN'T MURDER ANYBODY.

02:02.453 --> 02:04.295
WELL, I'VE LEARNED
THE HARD WAY,

02:04.295 --> 02:06.297
THAT THE TRUTH
DOESN'T ALWAYS SET YOU FREE.

02:06.297 --> 02:07.598
LISTEN, THEY'RE GONNA
RELEASE HIM IN A FEW HOURS.

02:07.598 --> 02:09.430
I REALLY WANT TO BE THERE.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.462
THEN LET'S PUT LUNCH ON HOLD.
GIVE ME FIVE. I'LL DRIVE YOU.

02:11.462 --> 02:14.435
NO, I-I THINK I SHOULD
PROBABLY GO BY MYSELF.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.507
THE PRESS IS GONNA BE
ALL OVER THIS.

02:16.507 --> 02:18.509
YOU REMEMBER WHAT THEY WERE LIKE
WHEN YOU WERE ACQUITTED.

02:18.509 --> 02:20.511
LIKE SHARKS
IN A BLOOD FRENZY.

02:20.511 --> 02:23.344
(sighs)
I'LL CALL YOU LATER, OKAY?

02:23.344 --> 02:24.415
MM.
 (kisses)

02:26.477 --> 02:29.420
WELL, SOMEONE OUT THERE
CLEARLY HAS YOU TARGETED.

02:29.420 --> 02:30.621
I'M JUST
TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

02:30.621 --> 02:32.423
OH, SPARE ME.

02:32.423 --> 02:35.626
THE ONLY THING YOU'RE PROTECTING
IS YOUR POMPOUS CAMPAIGN.

02:35.626 --> 02:39.560
HERE ARE THE MEDICAL RECORDS
YOU SO SENSITIVELY DEMANDED.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.333
PROOF OF THE TERMINATION
OF MY PREGNANCY.

02:42.333 --> 02:43.464
THOUGH WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH IT,

02:43.464 --> 02:45.296
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE.

02:45.296 --> 02:46.597
WELL, MY PLAN IS TO STAY
AHEAD OF THE PRESS.

02:46.597 --> 02:49.440
"NIGHTLINE'S" REPORTERS
ARE AMONG THE MOST THOROUGH.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.502
IF THEY TRY AND BREAK
THE SCANDAL THIS EVENING,

02:51.502 --> 02:55.306
WE ARE NOW POISED TO COUNTER
WITH AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.

02:55.306 --> 02:57.448
YOU MEAN SPIN.

02:57.448 --> 03:02.483
VICTORIA, YOU WERE
A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL,

03:02.483 --> 03:05.356
THE VICTIM OF HORRIBLE ABUSE
BY YOUR STEPFATHER.

03:05.356 --> 03:07.518
YOUR OWN MOTHER BANISHED YOU
TO THE STREETS.

03:07.518 --> 03:10.521
NOW DETESTABLE AS IT IS,
THE TRUTH,

03:10.521 --> 03:12.523
IN THIS CASE, WOULD ONLY WORK
TO OUR ADVANTAGE

03:12.523 --> 03:14.625
AND HIGHLIGHT
THE CAMPAIGN'S PROMISE

03:14.625 --> 03:16.527
OF FULL TRANSPARENCY.

03:16.527 --> 03:19.430
THE CAVALIER WAY THAT YOU
EXPLOIT MY PERSONAL PAIN

03:19.430 --> 03:20.671
IS APPALLING.

03:20.671 --> 03:22.633
WELL, IF YOU'VE BEEN SUFFERING
WITH YOUR CHOICES

03:22.633 --> 03:24.375
AL THESE YEARS, MY DEAR,

03:24.375 --> 03:26.307
I'M ONLY HAPPY I WAS ABLE
TO PROVIDE YOU

03:26.307 --> 03:28.339
WITH A COMFORTABLE PLACE
IN WHICH TO AGONIZE IN STYLE.

03:28.339 --> 03:30.611
WE NEED TO ADJUST
YOUR TALKING POINTS

03:30.611 --> 03:33.344
FOR THIS EVENING'S "NIGHTLINE"
INTERVIEW DOWNTOWN.

03:33.344 --> 03:34.615
YOU ARE DERANGED IF YOU THINK

03:34.615 --> 03:37.618
THAT I'M GOING TO SIT
BY YOUR SIDE ON LIVE TV

03:37.618 --> 03:41.392
WHILE I EXPOSE MY PERSONAL LIFE
TO SHORE UP YOUR VOTING BASE.

03:41.392 --> 03:44.325
WELL, MY DARLING,
YOUR PRESENCE IS MANDATORY,

03:44.325 --> 03:45.396
SO I SUGGEST...
 (folder thuds)

03:45.396 --> 03:47.298
THAT YOU BE ON
THE CHOPPER AT 5:00.

03:47.298 --> 03:49.530
AND I SUGGEST
THAT YOU GO TO HELL.

03:54.635 --> 04:02.313
♪♪♪

04:02.313 --> 04:03.444
HEY.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.316
I COME BEARING GIFTS.

04:05.316 --> 04:06.517
BLACK COFFEE FOR YOU,

04:06.517 --> 04:09.450
SKINNY NONFAT CAPPUCCINO
FOR ME,

04:09.450 --> 04:12.423
AND A NOT-TOO-HOT
HOT CHOCOLATE FOR CARL.

04:12.423 --> 04:15.526
I'M SORRY. I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT BABIES DRINK.

04:15.526 --> 04:17.458
NOT THAT.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.430
(chuckles) THANKS, ASHLEY.

04:19.430 --> 04:21.392
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

04:21.392 --> 04:23.334
WHAT'S THIS?

04:23.334 --> 04:24.535
CONRAD'S
OFFICIAL SCHEDULE.

04:24.535 --> 04:25.666
I MAY HAVE BEEN DEMOTED,

04:25.666 --> 04:27.398
BUT I STILL HAVE ACCESS
TO HIS CALENDAR.

04:27.398 --> 04:29.340
IS THERE ANYTHING HERE
I CAN USE?

04:29.340 --> 04:30.441
THE ELECTION'S A WEEK AWAY.

04:30.441 --> 04:31.672
I STILL DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH LEVERAGE

04:31.672 --> 04:33.644
TO GET CONRAD TO CONFESS
TO WHAT HE DID TO AMANDA.

04:33.644 --> 04:35.576
ALLOW ME
TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION

04:35.576 --> 04:38.609
TO THE THREE
TAX BOARD MEETINGS THIS WEEK.

04:38.609 --> 04:40.411
THEY'RE ALL RUBBISH.

04:40.411 --> 04:42.583
HE AND I CONCLUDED THE TAX BOARD
SESSIONS LAST MONTH.

04:42.583 --> 04:46.317
MY GUESS--THOSE MEETINGS
ARE A SMOKE SCREEN.

04:46.317 --> 04:48.319
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE HAS PLANNED?

04:48.319 --> 04:49.590
I WOULDN'T PUT ANYTHING
PAST THAT MAN,

04:49.590 --> 04:51.662
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, I'M UNABLE
TO DIG ANY FURTHER

04:51.662 --> 04:53.664
WITHOUT AROUSING
HIS SUSPICION.

04:53.664 --> 04:55.396
DON'T PUT YOURSELF AT RISK.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.597
I CAN TAKE CARE OF IT
FROM HERE.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.329
WELL, DO IT QUICKLY.

04:58.329 --> 05:01.372
HE'S GAINING CONFIDENCE,
AND WITH GOOD REASON.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.505
(turns volume on)
 (woman)
 ...RECENT POLLING SHOWING

05:04.505 --> 05:06.306
CONRAD GRAYSON WITHIN
 STRIKING DISTANCE

05:06.306 --> 05:08.479
OF EMBATTLED INCUMBENT
 GOVERNOR MARK STODDARD,

05:08.479 --> 05:09.610
WHO SEEMS TO BE FIELDING

05:09.610 --> 05:11.512
ONE BAD CAMPAIGN LEAK
 AFTER THE NEXT.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.484
IN OTHER BREAKING NEWS,

05:13.484 --> 05:16.387
TECH GURU NOLAN ROSS HAS JUST
 BEEN RELEASED FROM CUSTODY

05:16.387 --> 05:17.688
AFTER BEING HELD
 FOR QUESTIONING IN THE MURDER

05:17.688 --> 05:21.392
OF FORMER EMPLOYEE
AND RUMORED LOVER PADMA LAHARI.

05:21.392 --> 05:24.555
(reporters shouting at once,
camera shutters clicking)

05:26.096 --> 05:27.458
(shouting continues)

05:27.458 --> 05:29.530
GO.
 (tires screech)

05:29.530 --> 05:32.102
THANKS, AIDEN.
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

05:32.102 --> 05:34.505
(exhales) 20 HOURS...

05:34.505 --> 05:38.338
THEY KEPT ME
IN THAT PLACE...

05:38.338 --> 05:41.472
SHOVING PICTURES OF PADMA
IN MY FACE--

05:41.472 --> 05:43.444
THE CRIME SCENE,
HER BODY.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.446
NOLAN,
I KNOW HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.378
I'M SORRY.

05:47.378 --> 05:49.580
I WANT TO HELP YOU.
(exhales)

05:49.580 --> 05:50.651
(exhales)

05:50.651 --> 05:52.352
HOW?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.524
BY TAKING DOWN THE FALC0N.

05:53.524 --> 05:55.426
(exhales deeply)

05:55.426 --> 05:57.357
LISTEN, IF IT WEREN'T
FOR HIM,

05:57.357 --> 05:58.859
THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO FRAME MY FATHER

05:58.859 --> 06:01.662
OR FORCE PADMA
INTO DELIVERING THAT PROGRAM.
 (pouring liquor)

06:01.662 --> 06:04.094
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO KILLED HER, NOLAN.

06:04.094 --> 06:06.567
THE FALC0N IS THE REASON
THAT SHE'S DEAD.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.440
(exhales)
LOOK, BELIEVE ME,

06:09.440 --> 06:10.671
I WANT TO MAKE HIM PAY.

06:10.671 --> 06:13.444
BUT HE'S BEEN UNDERGROUND
FOR TWO DECADES.

06:13.444 --> 06:14.575
NO ONE KNOWS
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE,

06:14.575 --> 06:16.607
LET ALONE
HOW TO CONTACT HIM.

06:16.607 --> 06:19.510
VICTORIA DOES.

06:19.510 --> 06:21.512
SHE GAVE CONRAD DOCUMENTS
THIS MORNING

06:21.512 --> 06:23.614
THAT PROVE SHE TERMINATED
HER FIRST PREGNANCY,

06:23.614 --> 06:25.516
BUT WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S A LIE,

06:25.516 --> 06:27.518
WHICH MEANS THAT SHE'S GOT
SOMEONE COVERING HER TRACKS,

06:27.518 --> 06:28.789
SOMEONE TECH-SAVVY ENOUGH

06:28.789 --> 06:31.522
TO ALTER HOSPITAL RECORDS
IN A MATTER OF HOURS.

06:31.522 --> 06:34.425
UH, WHAT HOSPITAL?

06:34.425 --> 06:36.396
I TRACKED DOWN THE NUN
WHO HELPED VICTORIA.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.499
SHE SENT ME TO ST. MICHAEL'S,
BUT, OF COURSE,

06:38.499 --> 06:40.501
THERE'S NO RECORD OF HER
EVER GIVING BIRTH THERE.

06:40.501 --> 06:43.173
(huffs) I-I'M SORRY.

06:43.173 --> 06:45.576
I CAN'T GO HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH THE FALC0N.

06:45.576 --> 06:46.637
(chair scrapes floor)

06:46.637 --> 06:50.441
HE IS... (scoffs)
THE BEST THERE IS.

06:50.441 --> 06:52.112
BETTER THAN ME.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.445
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
FOR A SECOND.

06:54.445 --> 06:57.417
NOLAN, LISTEN TO ME,
THIS COULD BE OUR ONLY CHANCE

06:57.417 --> 07:01.652
TO BRING THE FALC0N
TO HIS KNEES.

07:01.652 --> 07:05.125
BUT I CAN'T DO IT ALONE.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.599
(exhales and sucks teeth)

07:08.599 --> 07:09.660
(sets cup down)

07:09.660 --> 07:11.131
(exhales)

07:12.603 --> 07:15.466
THEN LET'S TAKE
THE BASTARD DOWN.

07:31.582 --> 07:32.583
WE WERE MORTIFIED
 AT THE EVIDENCE

07:32.583 --> 07:33.684
PRESENTED AT THE TRIAL.

07:33.684 --> 07:34.855
DAVID CLARKE WAS
 OUR TRUSTED FRIEND,

07:34.855 --> 07:36.657
OR SO WE THOUGHT.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.629
(Conrad) ONCE THE PROSECUTION
 PRESENTED THE DATA

07:38.629 --> 07:40.631
SEIZED FROM HIS COMPUTER,

07:40.631 --> 07:42.663
DAVID'S BETRAYAL BECAME CLEAR.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.864
UH, THE COMMUNIQUES,

07:43.864 --> 07:45.796
THE MONEY LAUNDERING--

07:45.796 --> 07:47.738
THE EVIDENCE
 WAS BLACK-AND-WHITE.

07:47.738 --> 07:49.870
EVIDENCE FABRICATED
BY THE FALC0N.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.743
LOOK, I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
TAKING THIS GUY DOWN IS TO YOU,

07:52.743 --> 07:54.775
BUT ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT USING NOLAN?

07:54.775 --> 07:56.577
I MEAN,
IF HE MAKES A MISTAKE,

07:56.577 --> 07:58.779
THEN YOU RISK JEOPARDIZING
YOUR OWN OPERATION.

07:58.779 --> 08:01.752
NOLAN WAS LIKE A SON
TO MY FATHER.

08:01.752 --> 08:03.754
AND AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
WITH PADMA,

08:03.754 --> 08:04.855
HE NEEDS THIS.

08:04.855 --> 08:06.817
(Nolan) I FOUND IT.

08:06.817 --> 08:09.790
I SEARCHED THE RECORDS
AT ST. MICHAEL'S HOSPITAL,

08:09.790 --> 08:13.664
AND LOOK WHAT I FOUND
BURIED IN THE CODE.

08:13.664 --> 08:14.795
(Aiden) SO THIS FALC0N--

08:14.795 --> 08:16.827
HE JUST WORKS
FOR THE HIGHEST BIDDER?

08:16.827 --> 08:18.629
TRUE HACKERS ARE ALL ABOUT
THE CHALLENGE,

08:18.629 --> 08:20.571
PROVING THEY'RE THE BEST.

08:20.571 --> 08:23.574
SO HIS EGO
IS HIS WEAKNESS.

08:23.574 --> 08:25.505
WE CAN USE THAT
TO DRAW HIM OUT.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.677
HOW?

08:26.677 --> 08:28.508
IF VICTORIA BELIEVES
THAT SOMEONE FOUND OUT

08:28.508 --> 08:29.710
ABOUT HER PROCEDURE--

08:29.710 --> 08:31.511
SHE WOULD GO STRAIGHT
TO THE FALC0N,

08:31.511 --> 08:32.842
ACCUSE HIM OF SLOPPY HANDIWORK,

08:32.842 --> 08:36.787
AND THAT WOULD BLOW
HIS MOTHERBOARD.

08:36.787 --> 08:39.590
I THINK I'VE GOT
JUST THE THING

08:39.590 --> 08:43.523
TO PUSH VICTORIA
OVER THE EDGE.

08:52.703 --> 08:55.706
(exhales deeply)

08:58.839 --> 09:02.743
(baby crying)
 (Young Victoria)
 OH, PATRICK, SWEETHEART,

09:02.743 --> 09:03.744
BE QUIET FOR MOMMY, PLEASE?

09:03.744 --> 09:05.716
(crying)
 SHH.

09:05.716 --> 09:08.819
REMINDS ME OF ARSHILE GORKY.

09:08.819 --> 09:10.651
WITH A DASH OF KANDINSKY.

09:10.651 --> 09:11.822
ART STUDENT?

09:11.822 --> 09:12.883
JUST SPEND A LOT OF TIME

09:12.883 --> 09:14.685
AT THE NEW YORK ARTIST ACADEMY
LIBRARY.

09:14.685 --> 09:16.587
I'M THE DEAN
OF ADMISSIONS THERE.

09:16.587 --> 09:18.789
OH, WOW. SMALL WORLD.

09:18.789 --> 09:20.560
YOU HAVE A GOOD EYE.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.632
(chuckles)

09:21.632 --> 09:23.293
AND HE HAS A MATCHING PAIR.

09:23.293 --> 09:25.866
OH, NO.
I'M JUST THE BABY'S AU PAIR.

09:25.866 --> 09:29.299
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE
SEVERAL SCHOLARSHIPS AVAILABLE.

09:29.299 --> 09:31.742
(tablet chimes)

09:39.780 --> 09:40.851
(click)

09:48.358 --> 09:51.591
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW DEEPLY
DISTURBED I WAS BY THAT E-MAIL.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.726
CLEARLY, SOMEONE HAS MANAGED
TO EXPOSE YOUR FORGERY,

09:55.726 --> 09:58.328
which you led me to believe
was next to impossible.

09:58.328 --> 10:00.731
(altered voice) Not next
to impossible. Impossible.

10:00.731 --> 10:04.775
OH, I SUGGEST THAT YOU
CONSULT AN ONLINE DICTIONARY

10:04.775 --> 10:06.807
FOR THE MEANING OF THE WORD.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.739
Don't forget that while
you may be able

10:08.739 --> 10:10.310
to disguise your voice

10:10.310 --> 10:12.883
WITH PARLOR ROOM THEATRICS,
I KNOW YOUR TRUE IDENTITY.

10:12.883 --> 10:14.344
What do you want?

10:14.344 --> 10:15.746
THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.

10:15.746 --> 10:18.749
UNCOVER IT, SEAL IT...
PERMANENTLY.

10:18.749 --> 10:21.692
(beeps)

10:21.692 --> 10:23.794
(knock on door)

10:30.761 --> 10:32.663
(door creaks)
 HEY.

10:32.663 --> 10:34.735
EMILY.

10:35.866 --> 10:37.868
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:37.868 --> 10:39.409
(keys jangle)

10:39.409 --> 10:41.672
WELL, NOLAN SAID THAT
YOU'VE BEEN CALLING, SO...

10:41.672 --> 10:43.373
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT HE'S OKAY,

10:43.373 --> 10:45.645
BUT HE'S JUST GONNA LAY LOW.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.647
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME
ALL THIS WAY TO TELL ME THAT.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.320
I WANTED TO CHECK IN
ON MY GODSON AS WELL.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.382
EMILY, I DON'T NEED YOU...

10:52.382 --> 10:54.685
COMING DOWN HERE ALL THE TIME,
WORRYING ABOUT US.

10:54.685 --> 10:56.386
WELL, I DO WORRY,

10:56.386 --> 10:58.729
AND I PROMISED AMANDA THAT
I'D LOOK AFTER HER FAMILY.

10:58.729 --> 11:00.761
WHILE SHACKING UP WITH
THE ONE THAT RUINED HERS.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.432
JACK...

11:02.432 --> 11:03.694
(fabric rustles)

11:03.694 --> 11:05.736
I CAN'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

11:05.736 --> 11:07.367
I GOT SOMEWHERE
I GOTTA BE.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.770
(Carl fusses)
 CARL HASN'T CRIED ONCE
SINCE HIS LAST BOTTLE.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.772
I THINK I'M STARTING
TO GET THE HANG OF IT.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.344
ASHLEY.

11:14.344 --> 11:15.846
I THOUGHT YOU HATED BABIES.

11:15.846 --> 11:18.408
TURNS OUT,
CARL'S THE EXCEPTION.

11:18.408 --> 11:20.450
HE'S QUITE THE LITTLE CHARMER.
 (fusses)

11:21.752 --> 11:24.454
LIKE I SAID, EMILY,

11:24.454 --> 11:26.817
WE'RE OKAY.

11:26.817 --> 11:29.820
(Charlotte) THE ONLY WAY
I'LL MAKE IT THROUGH HARVARD

11:29.820 --> 11:31.722
IS IF YOU'RE BY MY SIDE.

11:31.722 --> 11:33.323
YOUR GRADES WON'T MATTER
AS MUCH

11:33.323 --> 11:34.725
IF YOU CRUSH THE S.A.T.,

11:34.725 --> 11:37.327
TOP IT OFF
WITH A KILLER ESSAY

11:37.327 --> 11:38.869
AND A LETTER FROM MY FATHER.

11:38.869 --> 11:40.771
NO, I-I JUST DON'T THINK
I'M A HARVARD GUY, CHARLOTTE.

11:40.771 --> 11:43.734
I WAS THINKING MORE LIKE
N.Y.U. OR SOMETHING.

11:43.734 --> 11:45.705
BUT THEY WANT
A KILLER ESSAY, TOO,

11:45.705 --> 11:47.738
AND I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED
THE FIRST SENTENCE.

11:47.738 --> 11:48.879
WELL, LOOK,
I'LL COME OVER TONIGHT

11:48.879 --> 11:50.480
AND HELP YOU OUT
WITH IT.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.982
BY THE TIME WE'RE THROUGH,

11:51.982 --> 11:54.785
THERE WON'T BE A DRY EYE
IN THAT ADMISSIONS OFFICE.

11:54.785 --> 11:56.716
THANK YOU.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.349
GOOD LUCK,
NOT THAT YOU'LL NEED IT.

11:59.349 --> 12:00.420
BYE.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.822
(indistinct conversations)

12:01.822 --> 12:03.894
YOU SURE KNOW
HOW TO HIT A BITCH.

12:03.894 --> 12:05.725
LOOKING FOR ROUND TWO?

12:05.725 --> 12:06.797
RELAX.

12:06.797 --> 12:09.760
IT'S A COMPLIMENT.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.863
SO YOU'RE "OVERACHIEVING
IVY LEAGUER" NOW?

12:12.863 --> 12:15.806
LAST YEAR, WEREN'T YOU
"SPOILED, ANGRY PARTY GIRL"?

12:15.806 --> 12:18.839
WHICH ONE'S
THE REAL CHARLOTTE GRAYSON?

12:18.839 --> 12:21.411
IT'S CLARKE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT, REGINA?

12:21.411 --> 12:24.414
A SIMPLE ANSWER.

12:24.414 --> 12:26.346
WHEN YOU TOOK ALL THOSE PILLS
LAST YEAR,

12:26.346 --> 12:28.348
WERE YOU REALLY TRYING
TO KILL YOURSELF?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.450
WHAT THE HELL
KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?

12:30.450 --> 12:33.753
THE KIND I WISH
I COULD ASK MY BROTHER.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.886
HE DID THE SAME THING
LAST SUMMER.

12:35.886 --> 12:39.930
SWALLOWED,
LIKE, HALF A PHARMACY.

12:39.930 --> 12:43.363
I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHAT HE WAS FEELING

12:43.363 --> 12:45.765
BEFORE HE DIED.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.537
THAT REALLY SUCKS.

12:47.537 --> 12:48.899
(sighs)

12:48.899 --> 12:50.871
YOU WANT TO GET OUTTA HERE?

12:50.871 --> 12:54.544
(indistinct conversations
continue)

12:54.544 --> 12:56.506
YES. THE WHOLE WORLD.

12:58.879 --> 13:02.552
(Nolan) I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
PADMA'S GONE.

13:02.552 --> 13:04.514
IT'S CRAZY, BUT, UH...

13:04.514 --> 13:06.356
(footsteps approach)
 SOMETIMES I...

13:06.356 --> 13:07.457
(keychain clinks)

13:07.457 --> 13:09.820
CATCH MYSELF I.M.ing HER,
LIKE, AT WORK,

13:09.820 --> 13:11.822
LIKE SHE'S STILL
DOWN THE HALL.

13:11.822 --> 13:13.363
(sighs)

13:13.363 --> 13:14.925
AND THEN IT...

13:14.925 --> 13:16.867
IT HITS ME ALL OVER AGAIN.

13:16.867 --> 13:18.899
THAT'S NOT CRAZY.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.434
THE LOSS NEVER REALLY
GOES AWAY.

13:24.434 --> 13:26.907
BUT TAKING ACTION
HELPS WITH THE PAIN.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.478
I SHOULD'VE TRACKED DOWN
THE FALC0N

13:28.478 --> 13:29.809
WHILE DAVID WAS STILL ALIVE.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.341
DON'T DO THAT TO YOURSELF.

13:31.341 --> 13:33.343
YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS, NOLAN.

13:33.343 --> 13:35.585
THE GRAYSONS
AND THE FALC0N ARE.

13:35.585 --> 13:37.387
(computer chimes)

13:40.490 --> 13:41.551
(sets cup down)

13:41.551 --> 13:43.553
OOH. SOMEBODY...
 (typing)

13:43.553 --> 13:47.597
JUST ACCESSED
VICTORIA'S MEDICAL RECORDS.

13:47.597 --> 13:49.399
FALC0N TOOK THE BAIT.

13:49.399 --> 13:51.401
OH, WHICH MEANS
HE'S ABOUT TO TRIGGER

13:51.401 --> 13:53.934
THAT LITTLE REWRITE
I DID TO HIS CODE.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.835
(beeps)

13:55.835 --> 13:56.937
(crying)

13:56.937 --> 13:58.438
(chuckles evilly)

13:58.438 --> 14:01.571
A LITTLE TOO ON THE NOSE?

14:01.571 --> 14:03.843
GOT HIM TO RESPOND
THE WAY WE WANTED HIM TO.
 (chimes)

14:03.843 --> 14:06.516
MM-HMM.

14:06.516 --> 14:08.578
(typing)

14:08.578 --> 14:10.420
(whoosh)

14:10.420 --> 14:12.422
(chime)

14:12.422 --> 14:14.424
"D.Y.T."?

14:14.424 --> 14:16.887
"DEFEND YOUR TITLE."

14:16.887 --> 14:18.858
BACK IN '88,

14:18.858 --> 14:21.361
I SET THE WORLD RECORD
ON "STREET FIGHTER"

14:21.361 --> 14:23.863
AT THE MongoBlaster
TOURNAMENT.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.497
IT WAS HELD AT, UH,
TEDDY'S ARCADE IN BROOKLYN.

14:27.497 --> 14:30.901
LOOKS LIKE THE FALC0N'S
READY TO PLAY.

14:30.901 --> 14:33.603
(typing)

14:47.918 --> 14:49.159
TELL NOLAN TO TAKE
AS MUCH TIME AWAY AS HE NEEDS,

14:49.159 --> 14:50.590
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO TO HELP,

14:50.590 --> 14:51.962
JUST LET ME KNOW, OKAY?

14:51.962 --> 14:53.663
THANKS, DANIEL.
AND NOLAN SAYS THANKS, TOO.

14:53.663 --> 14:55.425
LISTEN, I WAS THINKING ABOUT

14:55.425 --> 14:57.427
COMING TO THE STUDIO LATER
TO SEE YOUR INTERVIEW.

14:57.427 --> 14:59.469
THAT IS, IF YOU THINK
YOUR FATHER WON'T MIND.

14:59.469 --> 15:00.971
NO. NO, NOT AT ALL.

15:00.971 --> 15:02.902
I-I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU THERE.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.936
GREAT.
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.
 (cell phone beeps)

15:05.936 --> 15:07.607
OOH.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.580
I LOVE THE JEDI MIND TRICK
ON DANNY BOY.

15:10.580 --> 15:14.484
BUT IT'LL ALL BE FOR BUBKES
IF I CAN'T BREAK THE FALC0N.

15:14.484 --> 15:16.446
(jangles keys)
 YOU WILL.

15:16.446 --> 15:17.547
(sighs)

15:17.547 --> 15:19.549
(woman) MR. GRAYSON, YOUR 2:00.

15:19.549 --> 15:21.921
MR. TAKEDA,

15:21.921 --> 15:23.453
THANK YOU FOR THE MEETING.

15:23.453 --> 15:24.524
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.595
YES, IT HAS.

15:25.595 --> 15:27.457
PLEASE TAKE A SEAT.
 THANK YOU.

15:27.457 --> 15:30.460
I KNOW YOUR TIME
IS VALUABLE,

15:30.460 --> 15:32.002
SO I'LL GET TO THE POINT.

15:32.002 --> 15:33.964
I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT AIDEN MATHIS.

15:33.964 --> 15:36.436
HE'S RECENTLY MADE
SOME UNAUTHORIZED,

15:36.436 --> 15:38.468
AND DARE I SAY,
RECKLESS TRADES.

15:38.468 --> 15:41.011
WELL, BIG RISKS,
BIG REWARDS.

15:41.011 --> 15:43.543
UNFORTUNATELY,
HIS AGGRESSIVE STYLE

15:43.543 --> 15:45.475
HAS UPSET
SOME LONG-TERM CLIENTS--

15:45.475 --> 15:47.617
CLIENTS THAT I CAN'T AFFORD
TO DISAPPOINT.

15:47.617 --> 15:50.550
NOW I ASSUME YOU'VE KEPT
YOUR PERSONNEL FILES

15:50.550 --> 15:51.951
OF ALL YOUR EMPLOYEES.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.683
ABSOLUTELY. EXTENSIVELY.

15:53.683 --> 15:56.956
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD
LOOK OVER MATHIS',

15:56.956 --> 15:58.658
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND,
OF COURSE.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.230
(knock on door)
 YES--

16:00.230 --> 16:03.563
DANIEL, HOW--HOW FAMILIAR
ARE YOU WITH THE OVERTON...

16:03.563 --> 16:05.996
(huffs) MR. TAKEDA.

16:05.996 --> 16:08.668
(clears throat)
THIS IS A SURPRISE.

16:08.668 --> 16:12.042
(speaks Japanese)

16:12.042 --> 16:14.744
(speaks Japanese)

16:14.744 --> 16:17.007
MM.

16:17.007 --> 16:19.679
IF, UH, IF YOU TWO GENTLEMEN
ARE FINISHED,

16:19.679 --> 16:22.482
I'D LIKE TO TAKE MY OLD BOSS
OUT FOR A DRINK.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.753
OF COURSE.

16:23.753 --> 16:26.656
MR. TAKEDA, THANK YOU
FOR AGREEING TO THE MEETING.

16:26.656 --> 16:27.717
APPRECIATE YOUR HELP.

16:27.717 --> 16:29.489
THANK YOU, MR. GRAYSON.

16:40.470 --> 16:41.671
(Charlotte)
THIS PLACE IS AWESOME.

16:41.671 --> 16:43.703
I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS HERE.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.476
WELL, THE COOLEST PLACES
ARE THE HARDEST TO FIND.

16:46.476 --> 16:48.478
SAME GOES FOR PEOPLE.

16:48.478 --> 16:50.740
DEFINITELY TRUE IN YOUR CASE.

16:50.740 --> 16:52.542
YOU SURE DON'T MAKE IT EASY.

16:52.542 --> 16:54.684
(laughs, mouth full)
I DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK.

16:54.684 --> 16:56.716
THAT MUST BE NICE.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.518
(normal voice) WHY DO YOU?

16:58.518 --> 17:01.721
I MEAN,
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY A CELEBRITY.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.593
YOU SHOULD BE OUT
USING THE GRAYSON NAME

17:03.593 --> 17:05.454
TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

17:05.454 --> 17:07.656
BUT INSTEAD,
NOW YOU HIDE FROM IT.

17:07.656 --> 17:09.459
I'M NOT HIDING.

17:09.459 --> 17:11.560
I JUST DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY
OF BEING INVISIBLE.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.604
IF I MESS UP, MY PARENTS KNOW
ABOUT IT WITHIN TEN MINUTES.

17:14.604 --> 17:16.465
SCREW THEM.

17:16.465 --> 17:19.469
EMBRACE YOUR INNER BAD GIRL
AND COME OUT WITH ME TONIGHT.

17:19.469 --> 17:20.810
I CAN'T.

17:20.810 --> 17:23.613
I PROMISED DECLAN I'D HELP HIM
WITH HIS COLLEGE ESSAY.

17:23.613 --> 17:25.744
OR YOU CAN
TEAR IT UP WITH ME

17:25.744 --> 17:28.648
AND TO HELL
WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.680
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.583
♪♪♪

17:33.583 --> 17:37.487
(video game music and sound
 effects playing indistinctly)

17:44.664 --> 17:46.536
JUMP IN ANYTIME.

17:46.536 --> 17:49.539
(blows air)
I'M WAITING FOR SOMEONE.

17:49.539 --> 17:51.541
(man) YOU WIN.

17:51.541 --> 17:53.743
A BIRD OF PREY, PERHAPS?

17:53.743 --> 17:55.675
(huffs)

17:57.507 --> 17:58.648
FALC0N?

17:58.648 --> 17:59.809
SMART MOVE,

17:59.809 --> 18:02.552
USING GRAYSON
TO GET MY ATTENTION.

18:02.552 --> 18:04.614
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

18:04.614 --> 18:05.815
THANKS TO YOU,

18:05.815 --> 18:07.817
I'M CURRENTLY
THE PRIME SUSPECT

18:07.817 --> 18:10.490
IN THE MURDER
OF MY GIRLFRIEND.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.692
AND THERE ARE
CERTAIN DETAILS OF MY LIFE

18:12.692 --> 18:16.626
I'D PREFER DIDN'T SURFACE
IN THE INVESTIGATION.

18:16.626 --> 18:20.470
I NEED EVERYTHING
ON THIS DRIVE

18:20.470 --> 18:22.632
SCRUBBED FROM THE WEB.

18:22.632 --> 18:24.834
I'D DO IT MYSELF, BUT, UH...

18:24.834 --> 18:27.707
THEY'RE WATCHING
MY EVERY KEYSTROKE.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.579
I'LL PAY YOU
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

18:29.579 --> 18:31.541
DON'T INSULT ME, ROSS.

18:31.541 --> 18:34.544
DID YOU HACK INTO
THE STATE DEPARTMENT BACK IN '91

18:34.544 --> 18:35.745
TO MAKE MONEY?

18:35.745 --> 18:36.816
(exhales)

18:36.816 --> 18:39.819
OH, YEAH.
I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.751
YOUR REAL MIDDLE NAME
IS LESLIE.

18:41.751 --> 18:42.822
(chuckles)

18:42.822 --> 18:45.655
YOUR HACKER HANDLE
WAS "LORD ZOLTON."

18:45.655 --> 18:47.857
YOU USED TO VISIT DAVID CLARKE
IN PRISON, WHICH MEANS

18:47.857 --> 18:51.601
YOU UNDOUBTEDLY BELIEVE
I PLAYED A ROLE IN HIS DEMISE.

18:51.601 --> 18:53.663
LOOK, WILL YOU HELP ME
OR NOT?

18:53.663 --> 18:55.735
I THINK I'LL PASS.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.838
UH, HOW ABOUT, UH...

18:58.838 --> 19:00.670
WE PLAY FOR IT?

19:00.670 --> 19:03.813
I WIN,
YOU DO THE JOB FOR ME.

19:03.813 --> 19:05.615
AND WHEN I WIN?

19:05.615 --> 19:07.717
YOU WON'T.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.552
(Ashley)
Jack, what's going on?

19:12.552 --> 19:13.723
HOW YOU DOING?

19:13.723 --> 19:15.685
I'm sending you
some pics.

19:15.685 --> 19:18.658
LISTEN, UM...
(speaks indistinctly)

19:18.658 --> 19:21.831
(camera phone shutter clicking)

19:21.831 --> 19:23.833
(Conrad continues
speaking indistinctly)

19:23.833 --> 19:25.735
(beeps)

19:27.737 --> 19:29.639
(beep)

19:29.639 --> 19:31.801
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S ALISON STODDARD.

19:33.703 --> 19:34.774
(car door closes)

19:37.847 --> 19:43.613
WHAT THE HELL IS CONRAD DOING
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE?

19:43.613 --> 19:44.854
(buttons clicking)

19:44.854 --> 19:47.617
(music and fighting
 sound effects playing)

19:47.617 --> 19:49.659
YOU'RE OUT OF PRACTICE,
ROSS.

19:49.659 --> 19:52.522
YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING TOO MUCH
TIME IN THE REAL WORLD.

19:52.522 --> 19:54.664
WHAT? YOU SHOULD
VISIT IT MORE OFTEN.

19:54.664 --> 19:55.795
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW,

19:55.795 --> 19:58.568
THE ONLY EXISTENCE
THAT MATTERS IS ONLINE.

19:58.568 --> 20:00.570
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:00.570 --> 20:03.773
YOU ARE HIDING IN A WORLD
OF ONES AND ZEROS...

20:03.773 --> 20:05.605
(music and fighting
 sound effects continue)

20:05.605 --> 20:08.678
TOO AFRAID TO MAKE
AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION.

20:08.678 --> 20:10.840
CARING FOR SOMEONE
DOESN'T MAKE YOU WEAK.

20:10.840 --> 20:13.843
IT MAKES YOU STRONGER,

20:13.843 --> 20:16.586
WHICH IS WHY...

20:16.586 --> 20:18.788
YOU... JUST...

20:18.788 --> 20:20.590
GOT... SCHOOLED.

20:20.590 --> 20:21.751
UGH!
 (slams controls)

20:21.751 --> 20:23.493
(man) YOU WIN.
 (beeping)

20:23.493 --> 20:24.624
OHH!

20:24.624 --> 20:26.556
KNOCKOUT.

20:26.556 --> 20:28.528
(pants) NOW...

20:28.528 --> 20:29.759
YOU EITHER

20:29.759 --> 20:32.632
HONOR OUR AGREEMENT,

20:32.632 --> 20:34.834
OR IT'S GAME OVER

20:34.834 --> 20:39.739
FOR YOUR PRECIOUS
HACKER REPUTATION.

20:41.641 --> 20:42.872
(grunts)

20:42.872 --> 20:45.875
(camera phone shutter clicks)

20:55.485 --> 20:57.357
CHARLOTTE.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.359
YOU'VE BEEN AVOIDING ME.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.291
NO, MOTHER.
I'VE JUST BEEN BUSY.

21:01.291 --> 21:03.533
PUNCHING CLASSMATES
IN THE FACE?

21:03.533 --> 21:07.467
WOULD YOU HAVE APPROVED
IF I SLAPPED HER INSTEAD?

21:07.467 --> 21:09.268
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M OUTTA HERE

21:09.268 --> 21:10.640
BEFORE DAD DRAGS ME
INTO HIS INTERVIEW.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.442
OH, YOU'RE SAFE.

21:12.442 --> 21:14.504
I BELIEVE HE'S ON THE WAY
TO THE STUDIO RIGHT NOW.

21:14.504 --> 21:16.546
(man speaking indistinctly)
 AND I BELIEVE YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

21:16.546 --> 21:19.379
(Conrad) AH, AND FOR
THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE,

21:19.379 --> 21:22.412
THE TRUE HEART AND SOUL
OF OUR FAMILY HOME,

21:22.412 --> 21:24.554
MY EVER-BEAUTEOUS BETTER HALF,

21:24.554 --> 21:26.556
VICTORIA.

21:26.556 --> 21:28.388
CONRAD, WHAT IS THIS?

21:28.388 --> 21:30.620
THE FULL-ACCESS TOUR
FOR THE "NIGHTLINE" AUDIENCE.

21:30.620 --> 21:32.662
UH, WOULD YOU MIND
IF WE TAKE A FEW MINUTES

21:32.662 --> 21:34.624
BEFORE MS. CHANG'S ARRIVAL?

21:34.624 --> 21:36.496
LOOKS GOOD.
 THAT'S GREAT.

21:36.496 --> 21:39.329
(indistinct conversations)

21:39.329 --> 21:40.500
NOW, NOW, NOW,

21:40.500 --> 21:42.572
BEFORE YOU TURN ME TO STONE
WITH THAT LOOK,

21:42.572 --> 21:44.634
YOU LEFT ME
WITH LITTLE CHOICE, MY DEAR.

21:44.634 --> 21:47.437
AND YOU HAVE LEFT ME WITH
A LITTLE BIT OF A MIGRAINE.

21:47.437 --> 21:50.440
I EXPECT YOU TO CONVEY THAT
TO MS. CHANG.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.581
OH, VICTORIA, LOOK, I--

21:51.581 --> 21:54.414
LOOK, I'M SORRY...
FOR THE AMBUSH,

21:54.414 --> 21:56.646
BUT I IMPLORE YOU.
WOULD YOU DO THIS FOR ME?

21:56.646 --> 22:00.350
MY GOD.
YOU REALLY DO WANT THIS.

22:00.350 --> 22:03.393
OH, SECOND ONLY TO HOW MUCH
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED YOU.

22:03.393 --> 22:05.395
WELL, YOU CAN ONLY HAVE
ONE OF THOSE.

22:05.395 --> 22:07.357
MM.

22:07.357 --> 22:09.359
NEVER FEAR, CONRAD.

22:09.359 --> 22:12.362
I'LL ASSIST YOU
IN YOUR RISE TO POWER.

22:18.638 --> 22:23.643
YOUR EMOTIONS FOR EMILY
HAVE ENDANGERED HER MISSION.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.515
DANIEL'S GROWING
SUSPICIOUS OF YOUR PAST,

22:25.515 --> 22:27.417
A PAST
THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN ERASED,

22:27.417 --> 22:28.548
ALONG WITH YOUR NAME.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.450
I THOUGHT MY SISTER
WAS STILL ALIVE.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.352
I WANTED TO KEEP MY NAME
SO SHE COULD CONTACT ME.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.556
MORE EMOTIONS.
MORE MISTAKES.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.588
(speaks Japanese)

22:38.588 --> 22:40.089
NO.

22:40.089 --> 22:42.361
(exhales)
EMILY NEEDS ME.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.464
(speaks Japanese)

22:46.365 --> 22:47.667
YOU'RE WRONG.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.539
(indistinct conversations)

22:49.539 --> 22:51.370
THIS PATH...

22:51.370 --> 22:53.503
THAT YOU'VE LED US DOWN
LEADS NOWHERE.

22:53.503 --> 22:55.104
♪♪♪

22:55.104 --> 22:57.407
YOU SEE...

22:57.407 --> 23:00.650
I KILLED THE MAN
WHO MURDERED MY SISTER.

23:00.650 --> 23:03.583
IT GAVE ME NO PEACE.

23:03.583 --> 23:06.385
SO VENGEANCE
ISN'T THE ANSWER.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.157
AND WHEN EMILY'S MISSION
IS OVER,

23:08.157 --> 23:10.389
THEN SHE'LL REALIZE THAT.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.391
AND I'M GONNA END THIS,
FAST,

23:12.391 --> 23:15.164
AND WITH
NO MORE CASUALTIES.

23:15.164 --> 23:17.166
AND THERE'S NOTHING
THAT YOU CAN SAY

23:17.166 --> 23:19.499
THAT WOULD CHANGE MY MIND.

23:32.512 --> 23:35.545
(Ashley)
GOVERNOR MARK STODDARD...

23:35.545 --> 23:39.449
(Carl cooing)
 AND HIS WIFE ALISON
HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 28 YEARS.

23:39.449 --> 23:41.521
BOTH NATIVE ITHACANS.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.122
ALISON ACTUALLY DEFEATED MARK

23:43.122 --> 23:46.456
IN THE RACE TO BECOME
STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT.

23:46.456 --> 23:48.127
(cooing continues)

23:48.127 --> 23:49.659
(sighs deeply) I DON'T THINK
THAT CONRAD AND ALISON

23:49.659 --> 23:51.601
ARE HAVING AN AFFAIR.

23:51.601 --> 23:53.202
IS SHE EVEN HIS TYPE?

23:53.202 --> 23:54.634
SHE'S A WOMAN.

23:54.634 --> 23:58.608
SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING ON.

23:58.608 --> 24:00.540
BUT WHAT COULD IT BE?

24:00.540 --> 24:02.171
I COULDN'T SAY,

24:02.171 --> 24:03.513
BUT AFTER YEARS SPENT

24:03.513 --> 24:05.174
IN THE REVOLVING DOOR
OF GRAYSON MANOR,

24:05.174 --> 24:06.646
I DO KNOW ONE THING.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.518
CONRAD HAS A TELL.

24:08.518 --> 24:10.219
IT BETRAYS WHEN HE'S LYING.

24:10.219 --> 24:11.581
HE OPENS HIS MOUTH?

24:11.581 --> 24:13.182
NO, IT'S IN HIS EYES.

24:13.182 --> 24:14.654
IF I HAD FIVE MINUTES
WITH THAT MAN,

24:14.654 --> 24:16.526
I SWEAR I COULD GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS,

24:16.526 --> 24:21.130
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, I AM
PERSONA NON GRATA AGAIN.

24:22.562 --> 24:25.535
NOT IF YOU PLAY
YOUR CARDS RIGHT.

24:27.637 --> 24:29.468
WHO KNEW I HAD IT IN ME?

24:29.468 --> 24:32.201
OH, BESIDES YOU,
OF COURSE.

24:32.201 --> 24:35.174
ALTHOUGH... TRUTH BE TOLD,

24:35.174 --> 24:37.476
YOU THROW ME A TOKEN

24:37.476 --> 24:39.208
AND JUMP ME
IN FRONT OF "STREET FIGHTER,"

24:39.208 --> 24:42.151
AND... I TURN INTO
BRUCE FRIGGIN' LEE.

24:42.151 --> 24:44.153
UNTIL, UH...

24:44.153 --> 24:45.555
(sets bottle down)

24:45.555 --> 24:47.486
I'M IN FRONT OF ACTUAL
FLESH-AND-BONE BAD GUYS,

24:47.486 --> 24:49.559
AND I... (clicks tongue)
FALL APART.

24:49.559 --> 24:52.261
YOU GOT THE FALC0N TO DO
EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED.

24:52.261 --> 24:53.693
YEAH,
I GOTTA GIVE HER PROPS

24:53.693 --> 24:56.265
FOR THAT
"VICTOR VICTORIA" GAG.

24:56.265 --> 24:59.268
NO WONDER NO ONE COULD FIND...
 SHIM. (chuckles)

24:59.268 --> 25:02.271
WELL, THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE.

25:02.271 --> 25:03.673
I'VE GOTTA GET
TO THE INTERVIEW.

25:03.673 --> 25:05.705
I WILL TEXT YOU
AN I.P. ADDRESS

25:05.705 --> 25:07.637
RIGHT BEFORE THEY GO LIVE.

25:07.637 --> 25:10.139
I'LL BE READY.

25:10.139 --> 25:13.583
DON'T WORRY. NO ONE CAN PROVE
YOU MOTHERED A KID OUT THERE.

25:13.583 --> 25:15.184
NOT EVEN THE KID.

25:15.184 --> 25:17.186
(Victoria)
Are you absolutely certain?

25:17.186 --> 25:20.650
BECAUSE THERE IS A NEWS CREW
SETTING UP IN MY LIVING ROOM,

25:20.650 --> 25:22.121
ready to go live.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.252
Do you understand me?

25:23.252 --> 25:25.254
YOU WEREN'T THE TARGET.
I WAS.

25:25.254 --> 25:27.196
YOU JUST GOT CAUGHT
IN SOME HIGH-TECH CROSS FIRE

25:27.196 --> 25:28.598
BETWEEN HACKERS.

25:28.598 --> 25:31.230
I WON'T BE COLLATERAL DAMAGE
IN YOUR DUEL.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.633
(beeps)

25:33.633 --> 25:35.605
(beeps)
 (typing)

25:35.605 --> 25:39.609
I TOLD YOU,
YOUR SECRET IS SAFE.

25:39.609 --> 25:42.141
(beeps)

25:45.575 --> 25:48.147
I-I GOT THE SCHOLARSHIP?
(laughs)

25:48.147 --> 25:50.149
TWO YEARS
AT L'ECOLE DES BEAUX ARTS,

25:50.149 --> 25:51.220
ALL EXPENSES PAID.

25:51.220 --> 25:52.551
(exhales)

25:52.551 --> 25:55.324
YOUR FLIGHT TO PARIS
IS NEXT WEEK.

25:55.324 --> 25:57.556
(laughs)

25:57.556 --> 25:59.328
THERE'S ONLY ONE TICKET.

25:59.328 --> 26:02.161
WELL, BECAUSE THERE'S
ONLY ONE SCHOLARSHIP.

26:02.161 --> 26:06.135
(fussing)
 BUT I CAN'T JUST LEAVE PATRICK.

26:06.135 --> 26:09.138
YOU HAVE A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
OPPORTUNITY, VICKY.

26:09.138 --> 26:10.670
THE KID'S PARENTS
WILL FIND ANOTHER NANNY.

26:16.676 --> 26:19.679
(indistinct conversations)

26:32.291 --> 26:35.224
(indistinct conversations
continue)

26:41.600 --> 26:43.372
THANK YOU.
NO, IT'LL BE GREAT.

26:43.372 --> 26:45.174
I'LL TALK TO HER NOW.
ALL RIGHT.

26:45.174 --> 26:46.605
YOU MADE IT.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.607
DEJA VU.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.609
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE READY
TO FACE THE CAMERAS AGAIN?

26:50.609 --> 26:52.281
THE QUESTION IS, ARE YOU?

26:52.281 --> 26:54.243
THE PRODUCERS ARE PUSHING
FOR YOU TO JOIN ME.

26:54.243 --> 26:55.614
NOW I KNOW
IT'S A LITTLE LATE--

26:55.614 --> 26:57.316
DANIEL, HOW QUICKLY
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN?

26:57.316 --> 27:00.189
EMILY VALUES HER PRIVACY.
ISN'T THAT SO?

27:00.189 --> 27:02.321
ACTUALLY, I'D LOVE TO DO
WHATEVER I CAN

27:02.321 --> 27:04.253
FOR CONRAD'S CAMPAIGN.

27:04.253 --> 27:05.695
WHAT'S GOOD FOR ONE GRAYSON
IS GOOD FOR ALL OF YOU,

27:05.695 --> 27:07.156
ISN'T IT?

27:07.156 --> 27:09.228
I'M AS GRATEFUL
AS I AM HUMBLED.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.330
THEN IT'S SETTLED.
 GREAT.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.302
(man) DANIEL, WE'RE READY.

27:13.302 --> 27:17.306
I'LL CORNER CONRAD AS SOON
AS THE INTERVIEW'S OVER.

27:17.306 --> 27:19.368
AND I'LL
KEEP MY EARS OPEN.

27:19.368 --> 27:20.840
(Juju) SO, DANIEL,

27:20.840 --> 27:23.142
THE LAST TIME
 YOU SAT DOWN WITH "NIGHTLINE,"

27:23.142 --> 27:25.715
YOU HAD JUST ENDURED
 A GRUELING MURDER TRIAL,

27:25.715 --> 27:29.248
GRAYSON GLOBAL WAS ON THE VERGE
 OF FINANCIAL COLLAPSE.

27:29.248 --> 27:30.379
AND YET, HERE WE ARE
 A YEAR LATER,

27:30.379 --> 27:32.651
YOU'RE C.E.O.
 OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS,

27:32.651 --> 27:35.184
YOU'RE REUNITED
 WITH YOUR FIANCEE,

27:35.184 --> 27:37.156
AND "VANITY FAIR" WENT SO FAR
AS TO CALL YOU

27:37.156 --> 27:39.158
"THIS GENERATION'S
JOHN-JOHN AND CAROLYN."

27:39.158 --> 27:40.389
(chuckles)

27:40.389 --> 27:42.291
(laughs) I-I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT LAST PART,

27:42.291 --> 27:44.163
BUT, UM, I WON'T DENY

27:44.163 --> 27:45.695
I'M THRILLED
TO BE BACK WITH EMILY.

27:45.695 --> 27:48.237
WELL, IN KEEPING WITH
YOUR FATHER'S PLATFORM

27:48.237 --> 27:49.298
FOR TRANSPARENCY,

27:49.298 --> 27:50.669
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO COMMENT

27:50.669 --> 27:52.742
ON THE FLIP-FLOP
FROM LAST YEAR'S INTERVIEW.

27:52.742 --> 27:55.444
BACK THEN, YOU VOWED
FULL SUPPORT FOR YOUR FATHER,

27:55.444 --> 27:57.406
AND YET, RECENTLY,
THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS

27:57.406 --> 28:00.209
THAT YOU LED A COUP
AGAINST HIM AT GRAYSON GLOBAL.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.451
ALL DUE RESPECT,

28:02.451 --> 28:05.254
SIMPLY THE PRESS
TRYING TO STIR UP A STORY.

28:05.254 --> 28:07.186
NO, MY FATHER STEPPED DOWN

28:07.186 --> 28:08.457
TO FOCUS ON
HIS POLITICAL CAREER,

28:08.457 --> 28:10.389
AND I HUMBLY FILLED
THE VACANCY.

28:10.389 --> 28:13.292
FAIR ENOUGH. NOW, EMILY,

28:13.292 --> 28:15.224
THE PRESS IS CLAMORING
FOR DETAILS

28:15.224 --> 28:17.166
ABOUT YOUR REKINDLED ROMANCE.

28:17.166 --> 28:18.697
(chuckles)

28:18.697 --> 28:20.169
AND YET, YOU DON'T SEEM
TO SHARE THE GRAYSONS' POLICY

28:20.169 --> 28:21.300
FOR TRANSPARENCY.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.732
(chuckles)

28:22.732 --> 28:25.334
WELL, DANIEL AND I
AREN'T ONES TO KISS AND TELL.

28:25.334 --> 28:27.376
YOU KNOW,
WHEN DANIEL SUGGESTED THAT

28:27.376 --> 28:29.178
YOU JOIN US FOR THIS INTERVIEW,

28:29.178 --> 28:31.710
I ASKED HIM IF THERE WERE
WEDDING BELLS IN THE OFFING,

28:31.710 --> 28:33.382
AND HE SAID I SHOULD
ASK YOU DIRECTLY.

28:39.188 --> 28:41.350
WELL... (exhales)
ONE THING THAT I'VE LEARNED

28:41.350 --> 28:43.422
IS THAT YOU NEVER CAN BE CERTAIN
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.724
THAT BEING SAID,

28:45.724 --> 28:47.726
I CAN'T IMAGINE
AN HONOR GREATER

28:47.726 --> 28:50.199
THAN JOINING
THE GRAYSON FAMILY.

28:52.201 --> 28:55.264
WELL, FROM WHERE I'M SITTING,
IT'S A PERFECT FIT.

28:55.264 --> 28:56.305
MM.

29:19.028 --> 29:21.490

29:28.998 --> 29:30.469
(Emily) Jack.

29:30.469 --> 29:31.770
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

29:31.770 --> 29:33.502
LISTEN, I'M SORRY
YOU HAD TO SEE THAT.

29:33.502 --> 29:35.905
I OWE YOU AN EXPLANATION.

29:35.905 --> 29:38.908
You don't owe me anything.

29:38.908 --> 29:41.510
WHAT YOU SAW TONIGHT,

29:41.510 --> 29:42.852
it isn't what you think.

29:42.852 --> 29:45.915
I KNOW WHAT I SAW, EMILY.

29:45.915 --> 29:48.858
YOU'RE GONNA BE A GRAYSON.

29:48.858 --> 29:50.789
AND FRANKLY, I DON'T WANT
ANYONE FROM THAT FAMILY

29:50.789 --> 29:51.921
AROUND MY SON.

29:51.921 --> 29:53.562
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

29:53.562 --> 29:55.995
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE
CARL'S GODMOTHER ANYMORE.

29:58.828 --> 30:00.799

30:42.611 --> 30:43.943
OH, IT'S DECLAN.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.474
I COMPLETELY FORGOT
TO CANCEL WITH HIM.

30:45.474 --> 30:47.576
GO. I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

30:47.576 --> 30:48.978
ALL RIGHT.

30:48.978 --> 30:51.450

30:51.450 --> 30:53.522

30:53.522 --> 30:54.583
DECLAN.

30:54.583 --> 30:55.985
Charlotte, hey.

30:55.985 --> 30:57.856
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
HELP ME WITH THIS ESSAY.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.588
ARE YOU OKAY?
 I'm fine.

30:59.588 --> 31:01.590
IT'S JUST, MY PARENTS HAVE
THIS STUPID INTERVIEW,

31:01.590 --> 31:03.462
SO THEY'VE HIDDEN ME AWAY
IN THE TOWER

31:03.462 --> 31:04.934
TO MAINTAIN THE FAMILY IMAGE.

31:04.934 --> 31:06.465
WELL, THEN WHY DON'T I
COME TO YOU?

31:06.465 --> 31:08.537
I CAN BRING CARL,
AND--AND HE'D LOVE TO SEE YOU.

31:08.537 --> 31:09.939
I know
his uncle would, too.

31:09.939 --> 31:12.041
UM, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

31:12.041 --> 31:13.973
LOOK, I PROMISE
I'LL HELP YOU TOMORROW.

31:13.973 --> 31:16.045
I REALLY GOTTA GO.
 (beep)

31:16.045 --> 31:17.046
HOLD ON. I--

31:22.611 --> 31:24.914
(Regina) CAN YOU CHECK AGAIN?
WE'RE ON THE LIST.

31:24.914 --> 31:28.517
EXCUSE ME, SIR?
CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK ONE--

31:28.517 --> 31:30.619
IT'S UNDER "GRAYSON."

31:30.619 --> 31:32.491
(man) HEY, CHARLOTTE,
OVER HERE.

31:32.491 --> 31:33.622
POSE FOR THE CAMERA.

31:33.622 --> 31:34.924
HEY, COME ON.
 (camera shutter clicking)

31:34.924 --> 31:36.465
HOW ABOUT A SMILE, LADIES?

31:36.465 --> 31:37.526
(both laugh)

31:37.526 --> 31:39.898
FEEL LIKE
PUTTING ON A SHOW?

31:39.898 --> 31:41.630
WELL, NEEDLESS TO SAY,
A MAN IN MY POSITION

31:41.630 --> 31:43.572
WILL ALWAYS BE SUBJECTED TO

31:43.572 --> 31:45.474
SCANDAL AND TURMOIL.

31:45.474 --> 31:47.906
BUT THE CHALLENGES THAT
WE HAVE FACED AS A FAMILY

31:47.906 --> 31:51.480
HAVE ONLY FORTIFIED
OUR COMMITMENT TO TRUTH,

31:51.480 --> 31:53.482
OPENNESS,
AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
 OKAY, YEAH.

31:53.482 --> 31:56.485
(cell phone beeps)
 THAT'S PRECISELY WHY WE'VE
WELCOMED YOU INTO OUR HOME.

31:56.485 --> 31:59.588
WELL, I HAVE TO SAY,
I'M SO HAPPY TO HEAR THAT,

31:59.588 --> 32:01.920
BECAUSE MY TEAM HAS JUST
INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED

32:01.920 --> 32:03.552
A TIP THAT WE RECEIVED

32:03.552 --> 32:05.524
ABOUT
A LONG-SECRET PREGNANCY--

32:05.524 --> 32:08.527
UH, JUJU, I'M GONNA--
I'M GONNA STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.

32:08.527 --> 32:10.960
UH, APPARENTLY, IT WAS
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

32:10.960 --> 32:12.701
BEFORE MY OPPONENT WOULD USE

32:12.701 --> 32:15.934
THIS PAINFUL CHAPTER
OF MY WIFE'S PAST AGAINST ME.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.607
VICTORIA FACED
A TRAGIC CHOICE

32:18.607 --> 32:20.939
IN HER ADOLESCENCE, AND...

32:20.939 --> 32:22.941
I KNOW THAT IF SHE HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY

32:22.941 --> 32:24.673
TO DO IT OVER,

32:24.673 --> 32:27.516
SHE WOULD OBVIOUSLY
HAVE CHOSEN LIFE.

32:27.516 --> 32:29.518
MR. GRAYSON, I'M SORRY.

32:29.518 --> 32:30.719
JUST TO BE CLEAR,

32:30.719 --> 32:32.721
ARE YOU SAYING YOUR WIFE
HAD AN ABORTION?

32:32.721 --> 32:35.024
IN 1973, YES.

32:35.024 --> 32:38.527
AND WHILE WE WISH
WE COULD'VE KEPT

32:38.527 --> 32:39.588
THE MATTER PRIVATE,

32:39.588 --> 32:41.030
WE'RE NOT AFRAID
OF THE TRUTH.

32:41.030 --> 32:43.632
WAIT. WAIT.
FOR THE RECORD, MRS. GRAYSON,

32:43.632 --> 32:45.634
ARE YOU NOW DENYING
THAT YOU ABANDONED

32:45.634 --> 32:47.666
A 6-MONTH-OLD BOY
NAMED PATRICK

32:47.666 --> 32:50.669
TO ENROLL
IN A EUROPEAN ART SCHOOL?

33:04.613 --> 33:06.615
THE STORY IS TRUE.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.297
(exhales)

33:18.297 --> 33:20.029
(man) "NIGHTLINE" WILL BE BACK
 AFTER THIS COMMERCIAL BREAK.

33:20.029 --> 33:22.031
I REALLY SHOULD WATCH
MORE TELEVISION.

33:22.031 --> 33:23.572
(cell phone rings)

33:23.572 --> 33:25.734
(ring)

33:25.734 --> 33:27.005
(sighs)

33:27.005 --> 33:28.507
(beeps)

33:28.507 --> 33:30.609
OH, I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BE CALLING.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.010
(Falc0n) The only evidence

33:32.010 --> 33:33.542
OF VICTORIA'S SON...
 (clicking keyboard keys)

33:33.542 --> 33:34.683
EXISTED ON MY COMPUTER,
ROSS.

33:34.683 --> 33:36.014
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

33:36.014 --> 33:37.686
What, you didn't catch
that little present

33:37.686 --> 33:39.718
that I left
on your jump drive?

33:39.718 --> 33:41.720
The second you plugged
it in,

33:41.720 --> 33:43.652
a shadow program
automatically booted,

33:43.652 --> 33:47.025
GIVING ME
 ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER,

33:47.025 --> 33:49.027
WHICH I CAN SEE YOU
HACKING AWAY ON

33:49.027 --> 33:51.630
AT YOUR
NOT-SO-SECRET CYBERSPOT.

33:51.630 --> 33:52.801
I ALREADY KNOW

33:52.801 --> 33:54.733
EVERYTHING THERE IS
TO KNOW ABOUT YOU,

33:54.733 --> 33:56.735
AND, UH, I'M NOT
THE ONLY ONE.

33:56.735 --> 33:59.768
CHECK YOUR IN-BOX,
EDITH.

33:59.768 --> 34:02.040
(clicks keyboard key, beeps)

34:02.040 --> 34:04.042
Yeah.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.044
Nice, clear shot,
wouldn't you say?
 (slams table)

34:06.044 --> 34:07.746
THE FBI CERTAINLY
THOUGHT SO.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.547
KEEP YOUR HANDS
 WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.521
YOU MESSED
 WITH THE WRONG PERSON!

34:12.521 --> 34:14.483
SO DID YOU.

34:14.483 --> 34:17.485
(shouts indistinctly)

34:17.485 --> 34:18.627
(exhales)

34:18.627 --> 34:20.559
(chuckles)

34:27.166 --> 34:28.837
THE FALC0N WAS A CONSULTANT
FOR GRAYSON GLOBAL--

34:28.837 --> 34:30.768
EDITH LEE.

34:30.768 --> 34:32.841
BACK THEN, SHE WAS
JUST A COMPUTER PRODIGY

34:32.841 --> 34:36.105
BROUGHT IN TO DESIGN
THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL NETWORK.

34:36.105 --> 34:37.846
SO WHEN THE GRAYSONS
NEEDED AN EXPERT

34:37.846 --> 34:39.777
TO FAKE EVIDENCE
AGAINST MY FATHER,

34:39.777 --> 34:41.650
THEY USED SOMEONE IN-HOUSE.

34:41.650 --> 34:43.782
David Clarke's betrayal
was the birth of the Falc0n.

34:43.782 --> 34:47.085
After that,
she erased her identity,

34:47.085 --> 34:48.617
went off the grid.

34:48.617 --> 34:50.119
THERE WAS A GIRL
IN THE RETREAT PHOTO.

34:50.119 --> 34:52.090
SHE NEVER SHOWED UP
IN ANY OF MY RESEARCH.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.692
I ALWAYS JUST...

34:53.692 --> 34:56.764
ASSUMED SHE WAS
AN EMPLOYEE'S DAUGHTER.

34:56.764 --> 35:00.729
ANOTHER FACE FOR YOU
TO CROSS OFF.

35:00.729 --> 35:03.672
(huffs)

35:03.672 --> 35:05.774
ACTUALLY...

35:05.774 --> 35:08.637

35:08.637 --> 35:10.139
(computer beeps)

35:15.113 --> 35:16.715

35:16.715 --> 35:18.747
(whoosh)

35:18.747 --> 35:20.118
(huffs)

35:20.118 --> 35:23.622
This one's all you.

35:24.793 --> 35:26.755
(exhales) TO PADMA.

35:26.755 --> 35:28.157
(exhales)

35:33.762 --> 35:36.565
(sighs) AND DAVID.

35:37.906 --> 35:40.809
(knock on door)

35:40.809 --> 35:43.812
LISTEN,
I'M GONNA CALL YOU LATER, OKAY?

35:43.812 --> 35:44.843
(beep)

35:52.150 --> 35:53.622
HEY.

35:53.622 --> 35:54.683
HEY.

35:54.683 --> 35:55.884
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

35:55.884 --> 35:57.626
I'M FINE.

35:57.626 --> 35:59.888
AT THIS POINT, NOTHING
MY PARENTS DO SURPRISES ME.

35:59.888 --> 36:02.761
EVEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT
YOU HAVE A BROTHER OUT THERE?

36:02.761 --> 36:04.633
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE THAT,
BUT RIGHT NOW

36:04.633 --> 36:06.665
ALL THAT CONCERNS ME IS YOU.

36:06.665 --> 36:07.936
ARE YOU ANGRY?

36:07.936 --> 36:10.168
(chuckles) WHY, BECAUSE
MY BOYFRIEND SANDBAGGED ME

36:10.168 --> 36:11.770
ON LIVE TV?

36:11.770 --> 36:13.702
BOYFRIEND?

36:13.702 --> 36:14.903
(laughs) YOU KNOW,
THAT'S THE--

36:14.903 --> 36:16.705
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE CALLED ME THAT

36:16.705 --> 36:17.946
SINCE WE GOT BACK TOGETHER.

36:17.946 --> 36:19.648
(exhales)

36:19.648 --> 36:22.581
LISTEN, I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT I DID.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.713
BUT YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ME
MUCH CHOICE. ALL RIGHT?

36:24.713 --> 36:26.955
THE ONLY THING KEEPING US
FROM BEING TOGETHER IS YOU.

36:26.955 --> 36:29.588
AND IF HISTORY REALLY IS
GONNA REPEAT ITSELF,

36:29.588 --> 36:30.759
I CAN'T DO THIS.

36:32.591 --> 36:35.794
I WANT TO SPEND THE REST
OF MY LIFE WITH YOU, EMILY.

36:35.794 --> 36:38.667
BUT ONLY IF YOU WANT
THE SAME.

36:38.667 --> 36:40.929
THE NEXT TIME I SEE YOU,

36:40.929 --> 36:43.932
IF YOU DECIDED TO PUT
THAT RING BACK ON YOUR FINGER,

36:43.932 --> 36:45.734
I'LL HAVE MY ANSWER.

37:04.793 --> 37:07.756
IF YOU'RE THINKING
OF JUMPING,

37:07.756 --> 37:09.798
ALLOW ME TO ASSIST YOU.

37:09.798 --> 37:12.761
I'M IN NO MOOD
FOR YOUR GALLOWS HUMOR.

37:12.761 --> 37:14.603
THAT'S IRONIC,

37:14.603 --> 37:17.936
CONSIDERING HOW YOU HANGED
MY REPUTATION TONIGHT.

37:17.936 --> 37:21.670
YOUR REPUTATION?

37:21.670 --> 37:23.942
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT YOUR REPUTATION.

37:23.942 --> 37:26.775
YEAH, OR YOUR SON
YOU'VE BEEN COVERING UP.

37:26.775 --> 37:27.916
OR HOW DID SHE PUT IT?

37:27.916 --> 37:32.981
YOU "ABANDONED," YEAH,
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

37:32.981 --> 37:35.954
WELL...
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME NOW

37:35.954 --> 37:39.758
BEFORE THE MEDIA BLOODHOUNDS
DRAG HIM OUT INTO THE OPEN.

37:43.762 --> 37:46.665

39:16.885 --> 39:18.887
MS. DAVENPORT, DID YOU
REALLY COME ALL THIS WAY

39:18.887 --> 39:20.929
TO VAUNT YOUR ABILITY
TO GLOAT?

39:20.929 --> 39:24.693
I ALSO CAME TO HELP.

39:25.934 --> 39:27.636
(beep)

39:28.737 --> 39:30.969
YOU NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.802
I'VE PUT TOO MUCH INTO THIS
TO SIT ON THE SIDELINES

39:33.802 --> 39:35.774
IN THE FINAL WEEK
OF THE ELECTION

39:35.774 --> 39:37.706
AND WATCH IT
GO DOWN IN FLAMES.

39:42.881 --> 39:46.615
WELCOME BACK.

39:55.794 --> 39:56.865
(Victoria) HELLO, NOLAN.

39:56.865 --> 39:58.667
(gasps and coughs)

39:58.667 --> 40:01.630
(chuckles) VICTORIA.

40:01.630 --> 40:02.971
UM...

40:02.971 --> 40:05.704
WHAT A... WELL...

40:05.704 --> 40:08.637
(chuckles)
PLEASANT SURPRISE.

40:08.637 --> 40:09.908
TO WHAT DO I OWE?

40:09.908 --> 40:12.841
YOU'RE A COMPUTER GENIUS,
AND A REFORMED HACKER

40:12.841 --> 40:14.983
IF ONE'S TO BELIEVE
YOUR PUBLICIST.

40:14.983 --> 40:18.647
OH, SHE ADDED "REFORMED."

40:18.647 --> 40:20.919
MIGHT I ADD...

40:20.919 --> 40:23.992
REINSTATED SOLE OWNER
OF NOLCORP?

40:25.994 --> 40:29.898
OH. INTERESTING.

40:29.898 --> 40:31.960
MM.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.903
AND... IN RETURN?

40:39.768 --> 40:42.010
HELP ME FIND
MY FIRSTBORN SON.

40:55.724 --> 40:56.985
AS MUCH AS I HATE TO SAY IT,

40:56.985 --> 40:59.788
SHOULDN'T YOU BE WITH DANIEL
RIGHT ABOUT NOW?

41:00.889 --> 41:03.031
I WAS.

41:05.664 --> 41:09.738
DANIEL'S PUSHING ME
TO DEFINE OUR RELATIONSHIP.

41:13.902 --> 41:15.904
WHAT, ARE YOU ASKING ME
FOR MY PERMISSION?

41:15.904 --> 41:18.847
I DON'T KNOW.

41:20.879 --> 41:24.653
WELL, THIS WAS YOUR PLAN
ALL ALONG, WASN'T IT--

41:24.653 --> 41:27.656
RIP THE GOLDEN BOY
AWAY FROM HIS FAMILY,

41:27.656 --> 41:30.689
TEAR THE GRAYSONS APART
FROM THE INSIDE?

41:30.689 --> 41:33.792
LEAVE THEM BROKEN,
POWERLESS.

41:34.923 --> 41:36.665
YES.

41:36.665 --> 41:37.926
WELL, THEN TELL ME
THIS ONE THING.

41:37.926 --> 41:39.868
WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER,
WHEN...

41:39.868 --> 41:41.800
WHEN THEY'VE PAID FOR WHAT
THEY DID TO YOUR FATHER,

41:41.800 --> 41:43.001
THEN WHAT?

41:43.001 --> 41:46.635
(exhales)

41:46.635 --> 41:47.976
I CAN BE WITH YOU.

41:56.985 --> 42:00.649
THEN MARRY
THE SON OF A BITCH.

42:00.649 --> 42:01.920
AND TAKE THEM DOWN...

42:01.920 --> 42:04.793
ONCE AND FOR ALL.
