WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:03.419
Ah, excuse me, this is a...

00:03.586 --> 00:06.255
Closed set. We know. But we're
friends with the monkey, hmm?

00:09.009 --> 00:10.259
Good morning.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.052
Look who I brought!

00:12.220 --> 00:14.179
Your old friend, Harry Elafonte!

00:17.767 --> 00:20.853
Whoa, dude. Burn!

00:21.021 --> 00:22.396
I don't get it.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.732
He seemed so happy
to see me yesterday.

00:24.899 --> 00:29.278
Don't take it personal. He's under pressure,
starring in a movie and all.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.696
Oh.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.948
How big of a star is Marcel?

00:33.116 --> 00:36.243
In human terms? I'd say...

00:36.411 --> 00:37.953
- ...Cybill Shepherd.
- Whoa.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.663
- Really?
- Whoa.

00:41.458 --> 00:45.294
So you guys in the movie
or you just really paranoid?

00:46.588 --> 00:47.671
- Hey, Sal?
- Mm-hm?

00:47.839 --> 00:49.923
Jerry wants to know
if the monkey's ready.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.175
Excuse me?

00:51.342 --> 00:54.178
Jerry is the director?
Which one's he?

00:54.345 --> 00:57.139
- The one in the director's chair?
- Gotcha.

00:57.348 --> 00:59.224
Pheebs, walk with me.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.476
Okay.

01:00.643 --> 01:02.811
Um, why am I walking with you?

01:02.979 --> 01:06.398
Well, uh, we're just going
over here so that we can get away from...

01:06.566 --> 01:09.318
...the horrible flesh-eating virus!

01:09.486 --> 01:11.945
For the love of God, woman,
listen to me!

01:12.113 --> 01:13.781
Is he looking? Is he looking?

02:08.794 --> 02:10.503
- We've got a problem.
- Tell me.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.006
I can't do Chris' makeup.

02:13.174 --> 02:15.509
She refuses to acknowledge
her mustache.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.262
- Is it bad?
- It looks like her eyebrow fell down.

02:18.429 --> 02:21.598
Unless we convince her
to let me bleach it...

02:21.766 --> 02:24.434
...Jean-Claude Van Damme will be
making out with Gabe Kaplan.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.521
I'll talk to her.

02:27.689 --> 02:28.772
I hate actors.

02:30.316 --> 02:34.111
Nice camouflage. For a minute there,
I almost didn't see you.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.032
- Excuse me. Whoa.
- Ah!

02:40.743 --> 02:42.578
Uh, is your name Chandler?

02:42.745 --> 02:44.621
Uh, yes, it is.

02:44.789 --> 02:45.914
Chandler Bing.

02:46.082 --> 02:49.710
Do you know me or are you
just really good at this game?

02:49.878 --> 02:51.086
I'm Susie Moss.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.714
Fourth grade? Glasses?

02:53.882 --> 02:56.800
I carried a box of animal crackers
like a purse?

02:56.968 --> 02:58.719
Susie Moss!

02:58.887 --> 03:00.929
Right! Yeah! Wow!

03:01.598 --> 03:03.140
You look...

03:03.308 --> 03:05.809
Great job growing up.

03:05.977 --> 03:09.730
It's nice to see you don't still
wear the cap with the mirrors on it.

03:09.898 --> 03:13.442
Oh, I graduated fourth grade
and realized I wasn't a pimp.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.069
Heh, heh. Remember the class play?

03:16.237 --> 03:19.781
You pulled up my skirt and the
entire auditorium saw my underpants?

03:22.243 --> 03:26.496
Yes. Back then, I, uh, used humor
as a defense mechanism.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.165
Thank God I don't do that anymore.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.464
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

03:36.132 --> 03:37.883
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.886
I didn't know he was in this movie.
He is so hot!

03:41.471 --> 03:42.554
You think?

03:42.722 --> 03:46.099
The Muscles from Brussels?
Wham-Bam-Van-Damme?

03:46.267 --> 03:47.809
Did you see Timecop?

03:47.977 --> 03:49.478
No. Was he any good in it?

03:49.646 --> 03:52.356
Rachel, he totally changed time!

03:53.066 --> 03:54.149
Wow.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.361
- So why don't you go talk to him?
- Oh. Yeah.

03:57.528 --> 04:00.656
Go tell him he's cute.
What's the worst that could happen?

04:00.823 --> 04:02.115
He could hear me.

04:02.283 --> 04:03.575
Oh.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.453
- I'm doing it for you.
- Don't you dare! Don't!

04:06.621 --> 04:07.829
Don't!

04:07.997 --> 04:09.623
Tell him I cook!

04:11.042 --> 04:12.125
Excuse me.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.585
- Hi. Ha, ha.
- Hi.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.713
Um, this is gonna sound kind of goofy.
Ha, ha.

04:16.880 --> 04:21.426
But, um, my friend over there...

04:21.594 --> 04:23.387
...who cooks, by the way...

04:23.554 --> 04:26.056
Um, she thinks you're cute. Heh.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.100
You don't think I'm cute?

04:29.519 --> 04:31.436
I don't know. Um...

04:31.604 --> 04:32.771
Do you think you're cute?

04:35.650 --> 04:39.486
We're getting off the track.
Um, I was supposed to tell you...

04:39.654 --> 04:42.155
...my friend thinks you're cute.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.824
What should I tell her?

04:44.033 --> 04:48.704
You can tell her
I think her friend is cute.

04:50.873 --> 04:53.125
- Oh. Ha, ha.
- Huh?

04:54.961 --> 04:56.336
Whoa. Ha, ha.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.255
- Makeup!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.132
Oh, uh...

05:00.675 --> 05:01.842
Okay.

05:02.010 --> 05:08.098
Um, how many times do I have to touch you
on the arm before you ask me on a date?

05:10.184 --> 05:12.019
Well, uh, let's try one more.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.814
There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?

05:15.982 --> 05:17.399
I'll be there.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.193
And if things go well,
maybe this time...

05:20.361 --> 05:22.446
...I'll get to see your underwear.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.662
No one was around to hear that?

05:35.835 --> 05:37.502
- So, what'd he say?
- Ugh!

05:37.670 --> 05:38.837
What a jerk!

05:39.005 --> 05:43.133
I kept talking about you,
and he kept asking me out.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.177
Oh.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.305
Naturally, you know, I said no.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.350
Well...

05:51.517 --> 05:52.601
Thanks, anyway.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.478
He just kept asking...

05:54.645 --> 05:57.230
...and asking, asking, asking...

05:57.398 --> 05:59.858
If you want to go out with him, you can.

06:00.985 --> 06:03.320
Sounds like a jerk to me, but...

06:03.488 --> 06:05.822
Jean-Claude, she said yes!
I'll see you tonight!

06:09.202 --> 06:10.702
Thank you.

06:16.626 --> 06:20.295
Then Jean-Claude took me to Crossroads...

06:20.463 --> 06:22.672
...and we hung out
with Drew Barrymore.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.133
Oh, man. She's so smoking!

06:25.301 --> 06:27.135
She's got the greatest set of...

06:30.890 --> 06:31.973
No guys around, huh?

06:34.143 --> 06:36.478
- Anybody need anything?
- Oh, I'll have an espresso.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.230
Oh, I'll get it.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.691
If I ask you to,
you'll end up drinking it yourself.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.613
- That is so unfair.
- I know.

06:46.781 --> 06:50.826
Like you'd drink her coffee after
what you did to her with Van Damme?

06:52.620 --> 06:54.913
I have to cancel racquetball tonight.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.375
Marcel's trainer will let me
have him for a couple of hours.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.377
You're blowing me off for a monkey?

07:00.545 --> 07:02.337
We can reschedule for Saturday.

07:02.505 --> 07:06.216
Yeah, unless you hook up
with a bunch of pigeons.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.051
Hey.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.678
Stick a fork in me...

07:09.846 --> 07:10.929
...I am done!

07:11.097 --> 07:12.431
Uh...

07:12.640 --> 07:13.932
Stick a fork what?

07:14.100 --> 07:16.143
Like when you're cooking a steak.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.103
Oh, I don't eat meat.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.898
How do you know vegetables are done?

07:22.066 --> 07:25.193
Well, you don't.
You eat them and you can tell.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.154
Okay, then eat me, I'm done!

07:27.321 --> 07:28.864
Mm.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.617
- I've met the perfect woman.
- What?

07:32.785 --> 07:35.662
We're sitting on her couch,
fooling around...

07:35.830 --> 07:38.206
...and then she turns to me and says:

07:38.374 --> 07:40.167
"Did you ever want to do it
in an elevator?"

07:41.794 --> 07:43.086
What did you say?

07:43.254 --> 07:44.588
I believe my exact words were:

07:48.259 --> 07:50.635
How do you know if you wanna do that?

07:50.803 --> 07:51.887
Oh, you just know.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.397
Oh, we gotta go.
Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.107
No, no, no.

08:04.275 --> 08:08.487
What I had planned shouldn't take
more than two, three minutes, tops.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.741
Two hundred seconds of passion!
We gotta go.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.410
But, um...

08:16.329 --> 08:18.121
...here's an idea.

08:19.373 --> 08:22.209
Have you ever worn
women's underwear?

08:23.085 --> 08:24.794
Well, yes, actually...

08:24.962 --> 08:28.757
...but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.968
And there were three of us in there.

08:32.803 --> 08:35.889
I was thinking
it would be, um, kind of sexy...

08:36.057 --> 08:39.392
...if you wore mine tonight at dinner.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.358
You want me to wear your panties?

08:46.859 --> 08:47.943
Could you?

08:48.110 --> 08:49.903
If I was wearing your underwear...

08:50.071 --> 08:53.240
...then, uh, what would you be wearing?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.498
You're swell!

09:04.126 --> 09:06.753
I made Marcel's favorite dish,
banana cake...

09:06.921 --> 09:08.046
- Ooh.
...with mealworm.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.510
Ah.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.221
- Candle. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.224
What do you think is
gonna happen here tonight?

09:23.896 --> 09:25.188
Hello.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.649
Oh, hi, are you on your way over...?

09:29.652 --> 09:31.111
Oh.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.615
No, I understand.
A monkey's gotta work.

09:37.201 --> 09:38.285
It's no big deal.

09:38.452 --> 09:43.290
It's not like I, uh, had anything
special planned, you know.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.086
Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay, bye.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.679
Okay. Rachel, why don't you
start talking first?

09:57.847 --> 10:00.932
All right. I feel that this is totally unjustified.

10:01.183 --> 10:04.269
She gave me the green light,
I did nothing...

10:06.564 --> 10:09.274
Do you think I can't see you
in the TV set?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.822
Monica, if there's something
you'd like to share...

10:15.990 --> 10:17.657
You had no right to date him!

10:17.825 --> 10:20.952
- That's the most ridiculous...
- You sold me out!

10:21.120 --> 10:22.954
- I did not!
- You absolutely...

10:23.122 --> 10:25.123
Would you let me talk!

10:28.044 --> 10:29.711
Did you just flick me?

10:31.339 --> 10:34.257
Well, you wouldn't let me
finish and I was...

10:34.759 --> 10:37.594
- Ow, that hurt!
- Ow.

10:38.095 --> 10:39.262
Quit flicking!

10:39.472 --> 10:40.597
Ow! Stop flicking!

10:40.765 --> 10:42.432
You flicked me first!

10:42.600 --> 10:43.683
Ow!

10:43.851 --> 10:45.435
Ow!

10:47.355 --> 10:48.730
Okay, no, no.

10:48.898 --> 10:49.981
Let's not do this!

10:51.400 --> 10:53.652
- Come on. Happy thoughts.
- No! No!

10:53.819 --> 10:55.570
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!

10:55.738 --> 10:58.448
No! Ow! No!

10:59.158 --> 11:01.076
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, God!

11:01.285 --> 11:04.371
Oh! Ow!

11:04.538 --> 11:06.414
Now I'm gonna kick some ass!

11:08.751 --> 11:10.001
- Ow.
- Ow.

11:10.169 --> 11:15.256
Ow, ow, ow.

11:15.424 --> 11:19.219
All right. Now, I will let go if you both stop.

11:19.428 --> 11:23.431
- Oh! You want me to stop seeing him?
- Uh-huh.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.976
You want me to just tell him
you're seeing him instead?

11:27.144 --> 11:30.188
- Is that what you want?
- Okay.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.441
Oh, that's what you want?

11:33.609 --> 11:34.693
Yes.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.321
- Fine!
- Fine!

11:38.489 --> 11:39.906
There we go.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.157
- Ow.
- Oh.

11:41.325 --> 11:44.744
Ha. If we were in prison,
you guys would be, like, my bitches.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.839
Thanks for letting me tag along.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.340
Forget about it.

11:58.509 --> 12:02.137
- How you doing there, squirmy?
- I'm hanging in.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.222
And a little out.

12:07.351 --> 12:10.186
So assistant to the director?

12:10.354 --> 12:14.232
That's an exciting job.
You must have a ton of responsibilities...

12:14.400 --> 12:15.942
I don't do the casting.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.027
So, what are you guys gonna eat?

12:20.072 --> 12:23.450
How come all I can think about
is putting that ice in my mouth...

12:23.617 --> 12:27.203
...and licking you all over?

12:29.123 --> 12:33.251
Because I went to an all-boys high school,
and God is making up for it?

12:37.548 --> 12:39.466
I want you right here...

12:39.675 --> 12:41.301
...right now.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.553
Right now, right here?

12:43.721 --> 12:46.347
Don't you think we're in
kind of a public place?

12:49.310 --> 12:51.019
They do have the shrimp.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.898
- Oh.
- Meet me in the bathroom.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.073
I'm going to the bathroom now.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.043
Come on.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.755
All right, mister.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.132
Let's see those panties.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.968
Alrighty.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.055
Ooh. Ooh.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.433
But you know what would be even sexier?

13:30.601 --> 13:32.185
What?

13:32.353 --> 13:35.271
If you didn't have
your shirt tucked into them.

13:36.857 --> 13:37.941
Oh.

13:38.108 --> 13:42.570
All right. Now, I would like
to see you wearing nothing but them.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.073
Take your clothes off.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.492
But, uh, I hope you realize this means...

13:47.660 --> 13:49.661
...we'll miss hearing about the specials.

13:51.622 --> 13:52.705
Come on, hurry!

13:52.873 --> 13:55.959
Do you want this done quick or done right?

13:56.126 --> 13:59.838
All right, turn around.
I wanna see you from behind.

14:00.005 --> 14:04.968
Oh, oh. Somebody's been doing
his Buns of Steel video.

14:05.135 --> 14:08.596
So you want me
to, uh, clench anything or?

14:11.350 --> 14:14.644
Susie?

14:14.812 --> 14:17.063
This, ha, ha, is for the fourth grade.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.402
- Huh? What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

14:22.570 --> 14:23.653
What do I mean?

14:23.821 --> 14:26.489
I mean underpants, mister!
That's what I mean!

14:27.616 --> 14:29.033
What? What do you mean?

14:29.243 --> 14:30.535
My skirt...

14:30.703 --> 14:33.454
...you lifted. Kids laughing!

14:33.706 --> 14:36.291
I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!

14:38.294 --> 14:41.629
That was in fourth grade!
How could you still be upset?

14:41.797 --> 14:43.006
Well, um...

14:43.173 --> 14:47.260
Call me in 20 years and tell me
if you're still upset about this.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.727
I hope you realize you're not
getting these underpants back!

15:05.654 --> 15:07.363
I can't believe this. Ha, ha.

15:07.531 --> 15:10.909
Just two weeks ago,
I was watching Sudden Death...

15:11.118 --> 15:14.662
...and now I'm on a date
with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.372
Can you beat up that guy?

15:16.540 --> 15:17.957
Yeah.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.543
- Can you beat up that guy?
- Sure.

15:20.711 --> 15:23.212
Oh, this is so wild.

15:23.380 --> 15:28.509
I gotta admit, I was surprised
that you agreed to go on a blind date.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.637
Normally, I would not do it.

15:30.804 --> 15:31.888
Yeah?

15:32.056 --> 15:35.224
What made you make the exception for me?

15:35.392 --> 15:36.517
Rachel told me, uh...

15:36.685 --> 15:40.438
...you were dying to have a threesome
with me and, uh, Drew Barrymore.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.858
By the way,
Drew has some ground rules and...

15:46.111 --> 15:47.779
- Say you're sorry!
- No!

15:47.947 --> 15:48.947
Say it!

15:49.114 --> 15:50.990
No! I'm not gonna!

15:52.451 --> 15:55.244
- Say it! Say it! Great!
- Oh!

15:55.412 --> 15:57.205
Rachel.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.333
Say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.

16:01.752 --> 16:05.129
That is my favorite sweater!
That is my third-date sweater!

16:07.091 --> 16:09.509
Say you're sorry.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.971
You wanna play? Okay, let's play.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.305
Let's play.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.062
What are you gonna do?

16:21.230 --> 16:24.148
Give me back my sweater
or it's handbag marinara.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.736
You don't have the guts.

16:30.155 --> 16:33.282
Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken
to tell some guy he was cute.

16:42.751 --> 16:46.587
Oh, all right, stop! Stop the madness!

16:50.092 --> 16:51.759
This is crazy!

16:51.927 --> 16:55.054
Who can remember why
you're fighting in the first place?

16:59.643 --> 17:01.102
Yes, that's right.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.147
But still...

17:05.315 --> 17:06.816
Look at your purse!

17:08.068 --> 17:09.152
Look at your sweater!

17:10.779 --> 17:12.780
Look at yourselves!

17:16.201 --> 17:17.827
I'll help you fix your sweater.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.954
I'll help you...

17:20.122 --> 17:22.165
...throw out your purse.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.210
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.

17:27.546 --> 17:30.089
I'm sorry I went out with him
when I knew you liked him.

17:32.968 --> 17:36.095
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.

17:56.658 --> 17:57.742
Joey?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.660
Ma?

18:01.455 --> 18:03.122
Joey!

18:03.290 --> 18:06.542
What are you doing here?
I thought you guys took off.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.920
She took off with my clothes!

18:11.548 --> 18:14.425
- Are you naked in there?
- Well, not exactly.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.096
I'm wearing panties.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.015
Huh.

18:21.183 --> 18:24.352
You, uh, always wear panties?

18:25.229 --> 18:28.314
No, no. This is the first time.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.776
Wow. Talk about your bad luck!

18:31.944 --> 18:36.322
I mean, the first time you try panties
and someone walks off with your clothes.

18:38.283 --> 18:41.953
I was not trying them out.
Susie asked me to wear them.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.621
Let me see!

18:43.789 --> 18:47.250
No! I'm not letting you
or anybody else see, ever!

18:47.417 --> 18:49.502
All right, all right!

18:51.421 --> 18:53.589
Whoa.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.592
Someone's flossing!

19:02.391 --> 19:05.393
Joey, some people don't like that.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.688
Chandler's wearing panties.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.106
What?

19:10.274 --> 19:13.276
- Let me see!
- You don't have to see!

19:14.486 --> 19:15.611
Hi, tushy!

19:17.739 --> 19:21.075
- One of you give me your underpants.
- Oh, no.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.535
I'm not wearing any.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.039
How can you not be wearing any?

19:27.207 --> 19:31.002
Oh. I'm getting heat from the guy
in the hot-pink thong.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.631
Look, Ross. I'll give you
$50 for your underpants.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.675
Hey.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.828
- Can I have the milk?
- I'm almost done with it.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.079
Keep your panties on.

20:12.794 --> 20:13.878
Hey. Hey.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.255
- And I'm in the movie!
- Hey.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.799
- What happened?
- A virus victim called in sick...

20:18.967 --> 20:22.386
...so Cathy recommended me and boom!
I'm dying on a gurney!

20:22.554 --> 20:24.639
- Hey!
- Oh.

20:24.806 --> 20:28.809
Oh, Marcel just finished his last scene,
if you wanna go say goodbye.

20:29.311 --> 20:34.398
Uh, that's okay. He's probably
got parties to go to and stuff.

20:35.150 --> 20:40.238
You know, he's moved on.
That's the way it goes, right?

20:41.949 --> 20:43.074
Oh, my God!

20:43.659 --> 20:44.742
What?

21:31.081 --> 21:33.499
I think I want to write a song about all this.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.543
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

21:35.711 --> 21:39.130
Ooh, except one of the strings
on my guitar is broken.

21:39.339 --> 21:41.382
Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?

21:42.801 --> 21:46.178
- How long you been waiting to say that?
- About 20 minutes!

21:51.727 --> 21:54.020
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

21:56.857 --> 21:57.982
Cut!

21:58.608 --> 22:01.485
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

22:03.989 --> 22:05.072
Cut!

22:06.783 --> 22:09.118
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

22:12.080 --> 22:13.748
- Mommy!
- Ah.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.918
Can't you see what's going on?
This man is dead!
