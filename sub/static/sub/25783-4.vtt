Joe:
Oh, my God.

02:08.197 --> 02:10.406
Can you just admit
that maybe you were being

02:10.489 --> 02:11.780
just a tad bit over-reactive?

02:11.864 --> 02:13.030
What are you, crazy?

02:13.114 --> 02:14.197
Lance is hardly
the victim here, man.

02:14.281 --> 02:15.698
Plus, you said it best yourself.

02:15.780 --> 02:17.114
We can be whoever we wanna be.

02:17.197 --> 02:18.531
- Oh.
- So what do we need him for?

02:18.614 --> 02:20.281
Yeah, well,
maybe I was wrong.

02:20.364 --> 02:21.864
Besides, he's just
pullin' the same shit

02:21.947 --> 02:24.531
we pulled at ASM--
wanting to do it his own way.

02:24.614 --> 02:25.864
Ah, not quite, buddy.

02:25.947 --> 02:28.573
He was effectively stealing
money from us.

02:28.656 --> 02:30.822
I suppose, but was it stealing,

02:30.905 --> 02:32.322
or was it just overspending?

02:32.406 --> 02:34.489
All right, come on. You know
what? The debate is over.

02:34.573 --> 02:35.864

02:42.822 --> 02:44.656
Joe: You put your trust
in someone, you know?

02:44.739 --> 02:46.239
You bank your career on it--

02:46.322 --> 02:47.989
only to get kicked in the nuts
with a pointed shoe.

02:48.072 --> 02:49.114
It's so disappointing.

02:49.197 --> 02:50.531
All right,
he's fast and loose.

02:50.614 --> 02:51.864
We don't need that shit
in our lives.

02:51.947 --> 02:53.281
Yeah, no, totally.
So what do we do now?

02:53.364 --> 02:55.114
Well, we stabilize
our client list,

02:55.197 --> 02:56.656
and we rally the troops.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.072
Spencer: Jess,
where is everyone?

03:07.156 --> 03:08.489
This is everyone.

03:08.573 --> 03:10.072
Everyone else went with Lance.

03:10.156 --> 03:11.030
Where?

03:11.114 --> 03:13.072
He started his own company.

03:13.156 --> 03:14.406
Oh, fuck me!

03:14.489 --> 03:15.739
Well, it was nice
meeting you guys.

03:15.822 --> 03:17.072
No, no, no, no--

03:17.156 --> 03:18.239
You're not going anywhere.
Hang tight.

03:18.322 --> 03:19.239
I need you.

03:19.322 --> 03:21.739
Yeah. Excuse us.

03:21.822 --> 03:23.156
Is this a fuckin' joke?

03:23.239 --> 03:24.780
It must be,
because I am laughing

03:24.864 --> 03:26.698
my little scrawny ass off.

03:26.780 --> 03:29.197
Spencer: We bought the company
and its assets from you, Lance,

03:29.281 --> 03:31.448
so the ass you're laughing off
is owned by us.

03:31.531 --> 03:34.156
Oh, well, then you're
gonna have to sue me,
aren't you, Spencer?

03:34.239 --> 03:35.656
I will bankrupt you,
you piece of shit.

03:35.739 --> 03:37.614
- Do you hear me?
- Well, as I understand it,

03:37.698 --> 03:39.406
possession is nine-tenths
of the law, and currently,

03:39.489 --> 03:41.989
I possess everything
that you want to keep.

03:42.072 --> 03:44.239
Spencer over phone:
You have a non-compete, Lance.

03:44.322 --> 03:46.822
Yeah, about that non-compete.

03:46.905 --> 03:50.239
Why don't you say hello
to Kelly Slater?

03:50.322 --> 03:53.322
Hey, Spencer.
I was gonna call you
on the way over here.

03:53.406 --> 03:54.989
What's up,
my bald-headed brother?

03:55.072 --> 03:56.822
- Talk to me.
- I'm staying with Lance, man.

03:56.905 --> 03:58.448
You know I'm loyal to a fault.

03:58.531 --> 04:00.197
What happened
to the kanikapila
we just had on the beach

04:00.281 --> 04:02.614
with our 'ohanas,
what we talked about?

04:02.698 --> 04:05.114
I don't let a good pig roast
get in the way of business.
Sorry, bud.

04:05.197 --> 04:07.822
- I'm staying with Lance.
- Fuck that motherfucker!

04:07.905 --> 04:11.489
- He's a piece of shit!
- No, no, no, Actually,
fuck you,  Spencer.

04:11.573 --> 04:13.281
Now, the GOAT,
or King Kelly as people

04:13.364 --> 04:14.864
who actually know him
call him,

04:14.947 --> 04:16.947
and I are just gonna enjoy
some post-wave good vibes

04:17.030 --> 04:18.739
and talk about making
a lot of money

04:18.822 --> 04:21.281
while you do whatever
you do as a hobby. Ta-ta.

04:22.239 --> 04:24.656
Nobody fucking go anywhere.

04:24.739 --> 04:25.698
We're going to fucking war.

04:25.780 --> 04:26.905
( sighs )

04:26.989 --> 04:29.905
Trainer:
One, two... one, two, three.

04:31.780 --> 04:34.364
Damn. You are one angry
motherfucker today, Ricky.
What's up?

04:34.448 --> 04:35.989
He hits like he hates
white people.

04:36.072 --> 04:38.114
Nah, that ain't true, man.
I love you, Randy.

04:38.197 --> 04:39.531
Jay:
I love you too, Randy.

04:39.614 --> 04:40.989
One, two, three.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.489
Thinking about
un-retiring, though.

04:42.573 --> 04:43.905
Worked for me a couple times.

04:43.989 --> 04:46.072
Actually, it worked
for you about six times.

04:46.156 --> 04:47.656
Floyd, too.
What's the problem, Ricky?

04:47.739 --> 04:48.822
There you go.

04:48.905 --> 04:50.864
Well, how'd you feel
before you did?

04:50.947 --> 04:52.489
Emotionally or physically?

04:52.573 --> 04:53.822
Before you answer that,

04:53.905 --> 04:55.072
let's consider
the source over here.

04:55.156 --> 04:56.739
He's always off emotionally.

04:56.822 --> 04:58.448
( both shouting )

04:58.531 --> 05:00.072
I mean physically, man.

05:00.156 --> 05:01.573
How'd you know whether you
still had the gift?

05:01.656 --> 05:02.739
You never really know

05:02.822 --> 05:04.072
until you get punched
in the face.

05:04.156 --> 05:05.406
Are you joking, Randy?

05:05.489 --> 05:07.531
- Do I look like I'm joking?
- No.

05:07.614 --> 05:09.281
Jay: Rick, you're too pretty
to get punched in the face.

05:09.364 --> 05:11.905
Shit. That ain't never
stopped me before, Jay. Huh?

05:11.989 --> 05:13.656
But you gotta
really ask yourself,

05:13.739 --> 05:15.406
what's your motivation?

05:15.489 --> 05:16.698
Honestly, Ricky,

05:16.780 --> 05:19.739
if your motivation is external--
money and cars--

05:19.822 --> 05:21.489
you are done.

05:21.573 --> 05:23.406
That's what you
asked yourself?

05:23.489 --> 05:24.739
Yeah.

05:24.822 --> 05:26.573
That shit's deep, man.

05:26.656 --> 05:28.780
I like that shit.
Therapists ain't got shit
on y'all, huh?

05:28.864 --> 05:29.989
Y'all should put that
in the class.

05:30.072 --> 05:31.531
Oh, trust me.
We work on this

05:31.614 --> 05:32.739
more than we work on this.

05:32.822 --> 05:33.780
Gonna be real with y'all, man,

05:33.864 --> 05:35.239
I'd much rather be playing ball

05:35.322 --> 05:37.072
than sittin' around
in my Newport Beach mansion

05:37.156 --> 05:38.531
waitin' to die.

05:38.614 --> 05:40.573
How's that for motivation?

05:40.656 --> 05:42.614
Let's get some more therapy.

05:42.698 --> 05:43.905
Keep 'er goin'.

05:43.989 --> 05:45.156
It's Strasmore.

05:45.239 --> 05:46.822
Spencer Strasmore's my name.

05:46.905 --> 05:47.822
Get me Tony Hawk.

05:47.905 --> 05:49.489
Travis, I'm calling to tell you

05:49.573 --> 05:52.072
we're making a couple changes
at the head office.

05:52.156 --> 05:54.614
Shit. I'm not--
I love Lance.

05:54.698 --> 05:57.448
He's fucking insane.
Sorry, Joe, I gotta jump.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.905
I hope your fucking chute
doesn't open, ya dickhead.

05:59.989 --> 06:01.239
Chutes are for pussies.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.822
Tony. Just calling
to let you know

06:05.905 --> 06:07.448
that we are no longer
working with Lance.

06:07.531 --> 06:09.114
Yo, Strasmore, hold your pitch.

06:09.197 --> 06:10.156
I don't wanna put you out there

06:10.239 --> 06:11.489
any more than you already are.

06:11.573 --> 06:12.822
Lance is the one
who gave me the idea

06:12.905 --> 06:14.489
to do the video game
in the first place.

06:14.573 --> 06:16.573
I wasn't gonna call it
"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater."

06:16.656 --> 06:18.448
What the fuck were you
gonna call it?

06:18.531 --> 06:20.322
- "The Bird's Nest."
- The Bird's Nest?

06:20.406 --> 06:21.698
Aw, Tony. Jesus Christ.

06:21.780 --> 06:23.822
Long story. Either way,

06:23.905 --> 06:26.322
Lance has helped me build a lot
of parks for a lot of kids,

06:26.406 --> 06:29.322
so I gotta roll with the guy
even though he is kinda douchey.

06:29.406 --> 06:30.822
If things don't work out
between you guys,

06:30.905 --> 06:32.573
you know where to find me, OK?
I'm always here.

06:32.656 --> 06:34.281
Spencer, I've got Laird for you.

06:34.364 --> 06:37.239
Laird, King of the seas. Listen,
my man. So we're not gonna be--

06:37.322 --> 06:39.822
Laird: It's too late.
When I signed up
with the company,

06:39.905 --> 06:40.905
I signed up with Lance.

06:40.989 --> 06:42.156
You know my dad
always said to stick

06:42.239 --> 06:43.822
with the wave that
you rode in on.

06:43.905 --> 06:46.072
That's what I try to teach
my daughters, and, well,

06:46.156 --> 06:48.114
I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't
at least give Lance

06:48.197 --> 06:49.531
the benefit of the doubt.

06:49.614 --> 06:50.947
It's there's
one thing I understand,

06:51.030 --> 06:52.531
it's family tradition,
all right?

06:52.614 --> 06:55.114
You give my love to Gabby
and take care of yourself.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.448
- Where's Parker?
- No answer.

06:56.531 --> 06:57.780
Well, keep dialing.

06:57.864 --> 06:59.156
It's going straight
to voicemail.

06:59.239 --> 07:01.072
- Think he's with Lance?
- I have no idea.

07:01.156 --> 07:03.989
Make a list of people
who are staying and people
who are going.

07:04.072 --> 07:06.364
I think that's
gonna be pretty easy.

07:06.448 --> 07:08.406
Wait-- whoa.
Are you jumping ship, too?

07:08.489 --> 07:11.030
Well, that depends.
Are you guys gonna
promote me to manager?

07:11.114 --> 07:14.698
Holy shit.
Way to take advantage
of us when we're down.

07:14.780 --> 07:18.197
Jess, get the fuck
out of these offices.

07:18.281 --> 07:21.281
I'm only kidding.
Take an empty office. Congrats.

07:21.364 --> 07:23.364
Great. I'll make sure we
take care of the phones

07:23.448 --> 07:24.822
so people know we haven't
gone out of business.

07:24.905 --> 07:27.656
We are never out of the fight,
Jess, right?

07:29.822 --> 07:31.406
The fuck happened
to the TVs?

07:31.489 --> 07:33.239
( sighs )
They've gone dark.

07:33.322 --> 07:34.239
Where's the control booth?

07:34.322 --> 07:36.573
It's right next door.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.989
Let me know when you
get ahold of Parker.

07:39.072 --> 07:41.197
Respect.

07:41.281 --> 07:44.197
All right, bitches.
Let's get to work.

07:44.281 --> 07:45.614
( phone ringing )

07:45.698 --> 07:47.780
Major Teague!
How's your sunburn?

07:47.864 --> 07:50.573
The sun didn't fuck me half
as bad as you did, motherfucker.

07:50.656 --> 07:52.030
Jason:
What are you talking about?

07:52.114 --> 07:54.114
You lying piece of shit.
I'll fucking kill you!

07:54.197 --> 07:55.614
What the hell's going
on over there?

07:55.698 --> 07:57.364
Is that Tiffany,
or is that Tasha?

07:57.448 --> 07:58.822
Take a wild fucking guess.

07:58.905 --> 07:59.780
Fuck you, too, Jason,

07:59.864 --> 08:01.573
you conspiratorial asshole!

08:01.656 --> 08:02.864
I'm guessin' it's Tiffany.

08:02.947 --> 08:04.739
- Bingo.
- You got busted.

08:04.822 --> 08:06.698
No, I didn't get busted.

08:09.030 --> 08:09.905
Come out of there!

08:09.989 --> 08:11.614
Your girl Donna put me on blast.

08:11.698 --> 08:13.698
She put a pic up
on IG of me and Tasha.

08:13.780 --> 08:15.822
The shit was framed
and filtered.

08:15.905 --> 08:19.531
Why would she do that
unless you said something
to upset her?

08:19.614 --> 08:21.322
Tiffany:
Come out of there, you pussy!

08:21.406 --> 08:23.947
I ain't never coming out of here
with your crazy ass!

08:24.030 --> 08:26.072
I didn't say shit about Tiger,
and that's the truth.

08:26.156 --> 08:27.448
Be a man, Jason.

08:27.531 --> 08:28.989
OK, of course I said something.

08:29.072 --> 08:30.197
I'm an insecure fuck,

08:30.281 --> 08:31.614
just like any other dude
would be

08:31.698 --> 08:33.114
who found out their girl
was getting dicked

08:33.197 --> 08:35.156
by the guy that won
four Masters.

08:35.239 --> 08:36.905
- You need to fix this.
- ( banging on door )

08:36.989 --> 08:38.364
Is it even fixable?

08:38.448 --> 08:39.780
Donna gotta call Tiffany

08:39.864 --> 08:41.364
and tell her that she
brought her on the boat

08:41.448 --> 08:43.448
and I ain't know nobody
was coming except you.

08:43.531 --> 08:45.030
( sighs ) Fuck.

08:45.114 --> 08:46.656
You can't take care of it,
lose my number.

08:46.739 --> 08:48.780
Tiffany: Cheater!
You think you can cheat on me?

08:48.864 --> 08:51.780
- Abre la puerta!
- This bitch is crazy.

08:53.114 --> 08:54.780
( distant phone ringing )

08:54.864 --> 08:56.573
Un-fuckin'-believable.

08:58.531 --> 08:59.531
Joe: There you go.
There's your answer.

08:59.614 --> 09:00.698
They're all dead.

09:02.156 --> 09:04.822
Hey! How's your
breakfast burrito?

09:04.905 --> 09:06.573
It's delicious. It's vegan.

09:06.656 --> 09:08.322
Oh, that's fantastic.
Let me ask you something.

09:08.406 --> 09:10.864
Why the fuck are you
still eating breakfast?

09:10.947 --> 09:12.905
No, I--
I already had breakfast.

09:12.989 --> 09:14.030
This is an early lunch.

09:14.114 --> 09:15.114
Do you have
a job around here,

09:15.197 --> 09:16.239
or do you get paid to eat?

09:16.322 --> 09:17.947
Geez, Spencer.
He's just a kid.

09:18.030 --> 09:19.989
I'm sorry, sir.
It's just everything's on hold,

09:20.072 --> 09:21.406
and no one knows what to do.

09:21.489 --> 09:22.822
It's called work.
That's what you do.

09:22.905 --> 09:24.656
You find a disc,
and you pop it in,

09:24.739 --> 09:27.364
of somebody riding some sort
of board, and press play.

09:27.448 --> 09:29.072
- It's not that simple.
- Oh, no?

09:29.156 --> 09:30.448
You run things around here?

09:30.531 --> 09:32.698
No. The guys who runs
things was fired.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.364
- By who?
- By you. It was Lance.

09:34.448 --> 09:35.739
I'm just the station manager.

09:35.822 --> 09:37.030
Well, Mr. Station Manager,

09:37.114 --> 09:38.406
can you tell me,
why isn't anything

09:38.489 --> 09:39.531
playing on these screens?

09:39.614 --> 09:40.739
Lance said go dark,
we went dark.

09:40.822 --> 09:42.197
Everybody in the TV business

09:42.281 --> 09:43.822
knows you don't
go fucking dark.

09:43.905 --> 09:46.156
I'm not even
in the business.
I know that.

09:46.239 --> 09:47.614
Maybe that's why Lance
wanted to go dark--

09:47.698 --> 09:49.030
to do what's never been done.

09:49.114 --> 09:50.156
Or maybe he just wants

09:50.239 --> 09:51.239
to see how far he can push me

09:51.322 --> 09:52.531
before I snap his fucking neck.

09:52.614 --> 09:53.656
Look, I'm sorry.
I did not mean

09:53.739 --> 09:54.822
to make you madder--

09:54.905 --> 09:56.197
Hey, hey, hey!
Get your nose back

09:56.281 --> 09:57.531
in the tofu scramble
and shut the fuck up.

09:57.614 --> 09:58.656
All right, listen.
As everyone around here

09:58.739 --> 09:59.864
can tell from our memo,

09:59.947 --> 10:01.531
we had to let Lance go.

10:01.614 --> 10:02.864
We're the ones in charge now.

10:02.947 --> 10:04.698
What we want to see is something
on these screens.

10:04.780 --> 10:05.739
What did you have in mind?

10:05.822 --> 10:07.322
I don't give a shit.

10:07.406 --> 10:09.531
Just make it pretty
and keep it going.

10:09.614 --> 10:11.448
( phone ringing )

10:11.531 --> 10:12.573
Joe:
What are you guys doing?

10:12.656 --> 10:14.072
Come on. Make it pretty, and go!

10:14.156 --> 10:15.030
Did you find Parker?

10:15.114 --> 10:16.156
He's not picking up his cell,

10:16.239 --> 10:17.573
but it looks like he's headed

10:17.656 --> 10:19.239
down the PCH in his pickup.

10:19.322 --> 10:20.531
How do you know that?

10:20.614 --> 10:21.739
Jesse:
I hacked into his iPhone.

10:21.822 --> 10:22.780
Well, I had his password,

10:22.864 --> 10:24.156
so it wasn't that hard.

10:24.239 --> 10:25.281
I bet you think
I'm a stalker now.

10:25.364 --> 10:26.614
No, I don't.

10:26.698 --> 10:28.406
I think you're a very
resourceful woman.

10:28.489 --> 10:30.281
Cool. Can I get
another promotion

10:30.364 --> 10:31.406
if I tell you where he stops?

10:31.489 --> 10:32.905
Yes, you can, and I might even

10:32.989 --> 10:34.322
be giving you my job soon.

10:34.406 --> 10:35.864
Couldn't do without you,
Spency Spence.

10:41.489 --> 10:43.780
- ( Joe laughing )
- Wake up.

10:43.864 --> 10:46.780
That happened in reality!

10:48.489 --> 10:49.698
♪ Don't think twice ♪

10:49.780 --> 10:51.448
♪ You know I'm comin' for ya ♪

10:54.739 --> 10:56.364
( phone ringing )

10:56.448 --> 10:57.573
Spencer:
Siz calling. Third time.

10:57.656 --> 10:59.614
Avoid. Avoid,
avoid, avoid.

10:59.698 --> 11:00.864
Like I do with Vernon

11:00.947 --> 11:02.864
and fucking Odrick
and James Harrison.

11:02.947 --> 11:04.322
Avoid him.

11:04.406 --> 11:05.864
Siz, what's going on, brother?

11:05.947 --> 11:07.698
I'm up to my ass
in acupuncture needles,

11:07.780 --> 11:09.947
and they still don't
cause me as much pain as you.

11:10.030 --> 11:11.406
So I'm assuming you heard.

11:11.489 --> 11:13.072
Yeah. I heard you
fucked some shit up

11:13.156 --> 11:14.531
for you and your investors.

11:14.614 --> 11:16.406
I'm one of those, too,
just in case you forgot.

11:16.489 --> 11:17.739
No, I have not forgotten.

11:17.822 --> 11:19.281
We had a little problem
with our partner

11:19.364 --> 11:20.905
because he is
a self-indulgent prick

11:20.989 --> 11:22.322
and a pathological liar.

11:22.406 --> 11:23.780
Well, that pathological liar

11:23.864 --> 11:25.406
said you cut him out
of his own company.

11:25.489 --> 11:27.322
- Where'd you hear that?
- From him.

11:27.406 --> 11:29.864
Lance called me
in the middle of the night.

11:29.947 --> 11:32.156
Your buddy Lance is calling
our investors now.

11:32.239 --> 11:34.364
I've told you
he was a go-getter, right?

11:34.448 --> 11:36.114
Not that that's
a good thing, but--

11:36.197 --> 11:37.406
You know what
I'm talking about.

11:37.489 --> 11:38.822
( sighs ) Siz--

11:38.905 --> 11:42.864
Who the fuck buys
a business and fires the CEO?

11:42.947 --> 11:44.322
It's like buying a team

11:44.406 --> 11:45.822
and cuttin' your
All-Pro quarterback.

11:45.905 --> 11:48.030
I'm the CEO now.
He left us no choice.

11:48.114 --> 11:49.156
Sizzle:
That's bullshit.

11:49.239 --> 11:50.114
As my girl says,

11:50.197 --> 11:51.322
you always got a choice,

11:51.406 --> 11:52.489
and she's right.

11:52.573 --> 11:53.989
Lance is not the primary
asset of Sports X.

11:54.072 --> 11:56.406
- The talent is.
- Shit. I got talent, too.

11:56.489 --> 11:59.364
And my talent is my instinct
for protecting my investments,

11:59.448 --> 12:00.822
and those same instincts
are telling me

12:00.905 --> 12:02.364
you need to fix
this shit with Lance.

12:02.448 --> 12:04.322
It's too late.
I already made
the decision.

12:04.406 --> 12:05.864
It's in the best
interests of ASM.

12:05.947 --> 12:08.614
Well, I guess ASM
ain't in my best interest.

12:08.698 --> 12:10.072
Fuck it. I'm out.

12:10.156 --> 12:14.281
Sell my shares.
Cut me a cashier's check.

12:14.364 --> 12:15.322
We done?

12:15.406 --> 12:17.406
You're the worst patient ever.

12:17.489 --> 12:19.947
You validate?

12:20.030 --> 12:21.780
What? What? He hang up on you?

12:21.864 --> 12:22.822
He wants out.

12:22.905 --> 12:24.448
Oh, fuck me.

12:25.822 --> 12:29.364
( music playing )

12:29.448 --> 12:30.406
There's our guy.

12:30.489 --> 12:31.947
Yo! What up, my dudes?

12:32.030 --> 12:33.864
Where ya been, bro?
We've been looking for you.

12:33.947 --> 12:35.531
Yeah, I know.
I lost my phone

12:35.614 --> 12:36.531
in the tsunami.

12:36.614 --> 12:37.573
What tsunami?

12:37.656 --> 12:39.448
The one tearing
through Sports X.

12:39.531 --> 12:41.573
Ah, we take it you
heard from Lance.

12:41.656 --> 12:44.698
Yeah, I know. He left me
a long, crazy-ass voicemail.

12:44.780 --> 12:46.197
Kinda like an ex-girlfriend.

12:46.281 --> 12:48.156
Can't underestimate that dude,
though, you feel me?

12:48.239 --> 12:50.156
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.
Just two seconds.

12:50.239 --> 12:53.364
Listen, we got an amazing
plan in place, Parker, OK?

12:53.448 --> 12:54.947
We want that to include you.

12:55.030 --> 12:57.614
Next level shit.
Game-changing stuff, OK?

12:57.698 --> 13:01.030
Parker, you can tell by the way
we handled that Coke deal,
we know what's up.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.448
Listen. I know that we have a
slightly different vibe than you
and your crew,

13:04.531 --> 13:06.573
but, I mean, we can still
feel you, you know?

13:06.656 --> 13:10.030
You think
you can feel me, Joe?

13:10.114 --> 13:12.739
Yeah, I can absolutely
feel you. Yeah.

13:12.822 --> 13:15.989
Then what am I
feeling right now?

13:16.072 --> 13:19.656
Uh... confused.

13:19.739 --> 13:21.822
- Horny.
- Fuck. I shoulda said "horny."

13:21.905 --> 13:24.239
I was gonna say it.
I was gonna say "horny."

13:24.322 --> 13:26.573
Parker, look man. We wanna
continue to rep you,

13:26.656 --> 13:29.489
and we're very confident that
we can do a great job for you.

13:29.573 --> 13:31.114
Man, this ain't pigskin,
all right.

13:31.197 --> 13:34.072
What makes you think you know
anything about what I do?

13:34.156 --> 13:35.656
Oh, come on, man.
When those waves are firing

13:35.739 --> 13:37.072
and the energy's moving,

13:37.156 --> 13:38.239
you're out there
rippin' your turns,

13:38.322 --> 13:39.739
I know everything
about what you do.

13:39.822 --> 13:41.573
Plus, I'm part Samoan. Come on.

13:41.656 --> 13:43.156
( chuckles ) This is
a charming motherfucker.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.739
Right? He's part Samoan.

13:44.822 --> 13:46.197
- Of course he is.
- Must be somethin'.

13:46.281 --> 13:47.448
Look. We just want
the opportunity

13:47.531 --> 13:49.030
to keep working for you,
you know?

13:49.114 --> 13:50.239
Blow you the fuck up.

13:50.322 --> 13:51.698
We're counting
on that happening.

13:51.780 --> 13:53.281
I like you guys, all right?

13:53.364 --> 13:56.448
I really do, so I'm gonna
be straight up with you.

13:56.531 --> 13:57.780
All right, I'm not
going with Lance.

13:57.864 --> 13:59.156
All right. Fantastic.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.197
But?

14:00.281 --> 14:01.364
But I'm gonna chill,

14:01.448 --> 14:02.947
go no reps for a while.

14:03.030 --> 14:05.406
Just give us a couple months.
That's all. Couple months.

14:05.489 --> 14:06.989
Stop begging. It's all good.

14:07.072 --> 14:08.947
You change your mind,
you know where to find us.

14:09.030 --> 14:11.573
Appreciate that.
All right. I gotta go
get back to my friends.

14:11.656 --> 14:12.822
- Go kick ass.
- Joe: Yeah.

14:12.905 --> 14:14.531
- Yeah, so... appreciate it.
- Go.

14:14.614 --> 14:15.614
Yep. All right, man.

14:15.698 --> 14:17.239
- Take it easy.
- All right.

14:17.322 --> 14:19.030
( sighs )

14:19.114 --> 14:22.947
Goddamn it. I was gonna
say fuckin' horny.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.780
What-- He's 19.
Of course he's horny.

14:25.864 --> 14:28.072
( rap music playing )

14:28.156 --> 14:29.947
( door shuts )

14:30.030 --> 14:31.281
There he is.

14:31.364 --> 14:32.989
TTD: What's up?

14:33.072 --> 14:34.322
You all right, T?

14:34.406 --> 14:37.072
Yup. You had fun
with your He-Men?

14:37.156 --> 14:39.656
Yeah, did good, man.
Got some good work in, too.

14:39.739 --> 14:41.448
So you should do
your organs a favor

14:41.531 --> 14:42.780
and put it on your to-do list.

14:42.864 --> 14:44.780
It's on there--
all the way at the bottom.

14:44.864 --> 14:46.531
Did you get any advice
for your comeback?

14:46.614 --> 14:48.239
- Some.
- Like what?

14:54.614 --> 14:56.156
Punch me in the face.

14:56.239 --> 14:57.573
What?

14:57.656 --> 14:59.239
Is it so hard to understand
what I just said?

14:59.322 --> 15:01.156
I said, "Punch me
in the face."

15:01.239 --> 15:03.656
- Nigga, you crazy.
- You think I'm joking?
I'm not.

15:03.739 --> 15:05.156
You asked me what I learned,
this is what I learned.

15:05.239 --> 15:06.989
Now punch me in the face
before I beat your ass.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.739
Don't hit me!

15:10.030 --> 15:12.281
Oh, shit. You OK?

15:17.531 --> 15:18.905
Might be ready.

15:20.614 --> 15:23.614
It's time to have a real
conversation with Amber.

15:23.698 --> 15:25.281
You done lost
your damn mind.

15:25.364 --> 15:29.114
Forget Amber. You need
to have a real conversation
with a shrink.

15:30.322 --> 15:31.614
You all right?

15:35.072 --> 15:37.448
Fuck. Our lives are over.

15:38.989 --> 15:40.448
That's a little alarmist,
Joe.

15:40.531 --> 15:43.030
Yeah, well,
this ain't good, man.

15:43.114 --> 15:45.739
I figure, best-case scenario,

15:45.822 --> 15:47.573
we sell Sports X at, what,

15:47.656 --> 15:50.197
a 7, 8 million dollar loss,
right?

15:50.281 --> 15:52.822
But most likely
it's just gonna bleed and bleed

15:52.905 --> 15:55.239
like a tumor
hemorrhaging in my ass.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.739
That's OK. We got
a solution for this.

15:57.822 --> 15:59.281
We just gotta find it. OK?

15:59.364 --> 16:01.656
( sighs ) Lance was my contact,

16:01.739 --> 16:04.114
this was my deal,
I brought him in.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.448
I misjudged it. I'm sorry.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.573
Absolutely not.
This one's on me.

16:07.656 --> 16:09.406
It's my bad, and I never
should've let us

16:09.489 --> 16:10.989
get in this shit
in the first place.

16:11.072 --> 16:13.364
No, no. No chance. No chance.

16:13.448 --> 16:15.489
I take full responsibility.

16:15.573 --> 16:17.531
I had to see Lance
for who he really was,

16:17.614 --> 16:19.448
not who I wanted him to be.

16:19.531 --> 16:22.364
But it was a little hard
when you're rolling
at Burning Man

16:22.448 --> 16:24.072
dressed up like
a fucking Martian

16:24.156 --> 16:26.072
pretending to look
at art installations.

16:26.156 --> 16:27.739
Goddamnit.
Hearing that out loud,

16:27.822 --> 16:30.905
my priorities are
totally fucked.

16:30.989 --> 16:32.780
Tell you what my old man
used to tell me.

16:32.864 --> 16:36.030
Hey, Spencer, Spencer...
save it, OK?

16:36.114 --> 16:38.114
Save it. I've listened
to all your stories

16:38.197 --> 16:40.947
about your old man
and your brother and the--

16:41.030 --> 16:43.739
I just-- I don't
have a family.

16:43.822 --> 16:45.281
I don't have a family.

16:45.364 --> 16:47.947
You know, I was only child,
both my parents are gone,

16:48.030 --> 16:51.239
and, to make matters worse,
I killed my wife.

16:53.448 --> 16:54.656
You did, didn't you?

16:54.739 --> 16:56.281
I was just trying
to get your attention

16:56.364 --> 16:58.947
with a big headline,
like you usually do--

16:59.030 --> 17:00.656
"I'm an addict,
I come from poverty,

17:00.739 --> 17:01.947
and my brother
committed hara-kiri--"

17:02.030 --> 17:03.531
Don't fucking mock
my stories, man.

17:03.614 --> 17:04.614
- I'm not.
- It's fucked up.

17:04.698 --> 17:05.614
I'm just trying to tell you.

17:05.698 --> 17:07.364
I'm not a former All-Pro.

17:07.448 --> 17:11.573
I don't have 23-inch biceps
and a fuckin' horse cock.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.989
I'm just speculating.

17:14.072 --> 17:16.698
I had this,  man.
I had this.

17:16.780 --> 17:19.531
This was my  chance
to be the man.

17:21.656 --> 17:23.489
You got two things
you're great at.

17:23.573 --> 17:24.822
( sighs ) Yeah, what's that?

17:24.905 --> 17:26.864
Fearlessness
and self-awareness.

17:26.947 --> 17:28.489
Don't overestimate me, pal.

17:28.573 --> 17:30.656
If you like those qualities,
you can have 'em at cost,

17:30.739 --> 17:31.905
because they don't
mean shit to me.

17:31.989 --> 17:33.072
No. There's no need.

17:33.156 --> 17:35.656
You've already
given them to me, Joe,

17:35.739 --> 17:37.864
just by showing me the way.

17:37.947 --> 17:38.989
You've made me aware enough

17:39.072 --> 17:41.489
to realize that I overreacted

17:41.573 --> 17:43.864
and I shouldn't
have clipped Lance...

17:43.947 --> 17:46.114
and I'm gonna go
apologize to him.

17:48.030 --> 17:49.656
( sighs ) Are you fucking
with me right now?

17:49.739 --> 17:51.072
I wish I was.

17:52.656 --> 17:54.281
Have I told you lately
that I love you?

17:54.364 --> 17:56.114
Every day.

17:57.614 --> 18:01.448
Babe. Babe.

18:01.531 --> 18:03.239
Yo, I'm in here.

18:03.322 --> 18:04.573
Hi, sweetie.

18:04.656 --> 18:06.364
What are you reading?

18:06.448 --> 18:08.406
Sheryl Sandberg's "Lean in."

18:08.489 --> 18:10.364
I love that book.

18:10.448 --> 18:11.656
Doubt you read it.

18:11.739 --> 18:13.531
I haven't, but I support it,

18:13.614 --> 18:15.573
you know, women empowerment,

18:15.656 --> 18:17.864
females in the workplace,
sisterhood.

18:17.947 --> 18:22.448
Exactly. So... what's up
with the Chanel box?

18:22.531 --> 18:23.822
- Oh, this?
- Yeah.

18:23.905 --> 18:25.197
Just a little something
I got you.

18:25.281 --> 18:26.656
For real?

18:26.739 --> 18:29.614
Aww. How sweet of you,
babe.

18:33.406 --> 18:34.822
It's beautiful.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.614
Do you like it?

18:36.698 --> 18:39.698
I'd say you shouldn't have,
but you really should have,

18:39.780 --> 18:42.739
and don't think this is getting
you a blowjob anytime soon,
by the way.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.197
Babe, come on.

18:44.281 --> 18:45.864
Are you ready to admit
that you were wrong?

18:45.947 --> 18:47.739
That that girl shouldn't
have been on the boat?

18:47.822 --> 18:49.864
And by you staying silent,
you're an enabler.

18:49.947 --> 18:51.406
Might as well
be fucking her yourself.

18:51.489 --> 18:53.947
Whoa. How did this
become about me?

18:54.030 --> 18:55.698
Because it is.
You're complicit.

18:55.780 --> 18:56.947
That's what
you're not getting.

18:57.030 --> 18:58.281
You're right. I don't--

18:58.364 --> 19:00.030
I didn't,
but what you don't get

19:00.114 --> 19:01.573
is this is business.

19:01.656 --> 19:03.197
Kisan's not my friend--

19:03.281 --> 19:05.322
he's my client
that you put on blast,

19:05.406 --> 19:06.322
and I can't even get him

19:06.406 --> 19:07.698
on the phone until you fix this.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.864
Sheryl would understand.
She's worth a billion.

19:10.947 --> 19:12.947
Right. I hope you're not
asking me to apologize.

19:13.030 --> 19:14.072
Of course not. I would never.

19:14.156 --> 19:16.406
I want you to lie.

19:16.489 --> 19:20.656
- Fuck you.
- Babe, just... call Tiffany,

19:20.739 --> 19:22.780
tell her that you
invited Tasha. Please.

19:22.864 --> 19:25.364
It's just business.
It's my business.

19:26.573 --> 19:28.197
Please.

19:31.072 --> 19:32.822
He hasn't missed a beat.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.656
This guy's already operating
at full strength.

19:34.739 --> 19:36.947
I wish he had been like this
with us in the first place.

19:37.030 --> 19:39.156
Yeah, well,
getting fired can be
a great motivator.

19:39.239 --> 19:41.364
Trust me. I've been cut
on several occasions.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.947
Oh, I'll keep that in mind,
but I like my current job.

19:44.030 --> 19:45.030
I wanna keep it.

19:45.114 --> 19:46.030
( sighs )

19:47.489 --> 19:49.072
- Hey. What's up, guys?
- Yeah, what's up?

19:49.156 --> 19:50.364
What happened
to our call back, Nyjah?

19:50.448 --> 19:51.989
Aw, man. I was out
car shopping.

19:52.072 --> 19:55.281
Car shopping? Don't you have,
like, 16 cars already?

19:55.364 --> 19:57.281
Yeah, bro.
I need a yellow one.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.614
( chuckles ) Yeah,
you do. Fuck your cars.

19:59.739 --> 20:01.197
Nyjah:
Fuckin' bullies.

20:02.406 --> 20:03.656
You know, that kid
really can skate.

20:03.739 --> 20:05.322
Yeah, Joe, uh,
I'm getting ready

20:05.406 --> 20:07.281
to do something
incredibly uncomfortable,

20:07.364 --> 20:08.780
so please don't speak.

20:08.864 --> 20:11.030
OK. Forgiving is living.

20:11.114 --> 20:13.489
Spencer:
Let's do this.

20:13.573 --> 20:17.322
Oh, no. Oh, wow. This is--
This is amazing.

20:17.406 --> 20:18.989
I knew I'd see you guys again,

20:19.072 --> 20:20.698
but I assumed it would be
in a court of law.

20:20.780 --> 20:22.197
Yeah, well, that would
make the lawyers rich.

20:22.281 --> 20:24.197
I'd rather concentrate
on making me rich.

20:24.281 --> 20:25.489
You're rich in spirit.

20:25.573 --> 20:26.739
Thank you, Joe.

20:26.822 --> 20:29.239
Although, it is
a little bit evil.

20:29.322 --> 20:32.406
Now how's life at the chocolate
factory without Willy Wonka?

20:32.489 --> 20:33.947
Augustus Gloop, did ya?

20:34.030 --> 20:36.030
I gotta give it you, Lance.
I'm really impressed.

20:36.114 --> 20:37.489
You really turned it up a notch.

20:37.573 --> 20:39.156
Shit's poppin' off here.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.364
- People often underestimate me.
- That's why I'm here.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.072
I wanna tell you
that I've overreacted

20:43.156 --> 20:45.448
and I was wrong to assume
that we didn't need you

20:45.531 --> 20:47.864
and I apologize.

20:47.947 --> 20:51.614
I'm sorry. Would you
say that again, please?

20:51.698 --> 20:54.573
I said, "I apologize"
to you.

20:54.656 --> 20:56.072
You were wrong, weren't you?

20:56.156 --> 20:57.531
- He just said it. Lance...
- It's all right.

20:57.614 --> 20:58.905
Now, well, listen.
I'm allowed to...

20:58.989 --> 21:01.364
enjoy the moment
a little bit, aren't I?

21:01.448 --> 21:06.072
To bask in the vitamin D-giving
rays of your apology,

21:06.156 --> 21:08.698
just for a moment
to feel it?

21:08.780 --> 21:09.947
What? That makes me terrible?

21:10.030 --> 21:11.573
To put it bluntly, Lance,

21:11.656 --> 21:13.364
we can't do this without you.

21:13.448 --> 21:15.614
I appreciate your
acknowledgement, Spencer.

21:15.698 --> 21:18.864
It's a little late, but it's
a step in the right direction.

21:18.947 --> 21:20.905
I am so impressed
with this guy right here.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.947
Constantly improving
right before my very eyes.

21:25.989 --> 21:28.364
So, um, what do you say?

21:28.448 --> 21:30.239
I mean, are you gonna
come back to work with us?

21:30.322 --> 21:32.905
We'll make it fun for you.
We'll stay out of your way.

21:32.989 --> 21:34.698
Well, that is
a very nice little offer,

21:34.780 --> 21:37.239
but I think I've got
an even nicer one.

21:37.322 --> 21:38.239
What's that?

21:38.322 --> 21:39.739
I got new financing,

21:39.822 --> 21:41.739
as even you can surely deduce

21:41.822 --> 21:43.822
from all this bustling
activity.

21:43.905 --> 21:45.239
So how about this?

21:45.322 --> 21:47.406
I buy my company
back from you

21:47.489 --> 21:49.739
at 50 cents on the dollar,

21:49.822 --> 21:53.322
and you go back
to what you're good at--
football and finance.

21:55.489 --> 21:58.989
Have a little moment,
a tête-à-tête.
Mull it over.

22:00.281 --> 22:01.864
Ahh..

22:01.947 --> 22:03.780
Joe: So what are you thinking?

22:03.864 --> 22:06.197
As much as I hate
this motherfucker,

22:06.281 --> 22:08.281
and as much as I hate telling
you this right now,

22:08.364 --> 22:09.864
I think we should
take the offer.

22:09.947 --> 22:12.531
- Cut our loss.
- Losses,  plural.

22:12.614 --> 22:14.114
- Tick-tock, tick-tock, fellas.
- Remember? A lot of 'em.

22:14.197 --> 22:15.698
This is a sunset clause.

22:15.780 --> 22:17.989
Let's take the offer,
get the fuck out of here, Joe.

22:18.072 --> 22:19.573
Come on.

22:19.656 --> 22:22.322
Yeah. Listen, hey--
may I run point

22:22.406 --> 22:24.822
on the negotiations from here?

22:24.905 --> 22:27.072
- Take us home.
- All right.

22:28.531 --> 22:32.197
So... how about you
take that offer,

22:32.281 --> 22:35.531
and you stick it straight up
your fuckin' ass?

22:35.614 --> 22:37.156
That's a little reactive.

22:37.239 --> 22:39.614
It's the only way
I like to be, really.

22:39.698 --> 22:41.364
- Fuck you.
- ( laughing )

22:41.448 --> 22:43.864
Fuck you. No sale.

22:43.947 --> 22:45.780
OK, well, you guys
are making a mistake.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.739
You know you guys
have got nothing, right?

22:47.822 --> 22:49.739
You got a couple pieces
of whack talent

22:49.822 --> 22:51.656
and a moderately
successful surf channel.

22:51.739 --> 22:53.614
Lance:
Without me, you got nothing.

22:53.698 --> 22:55.030
I know, but it's what we do.

22:55.114 --> 22:57.489
We make it work. ( laughs )

SPENCER STRASMORE:
You wanna sell Sports X back,

25:04.030 --> 25:05.448
or do you wanna
grind it out to be

25:05.531 --> 25:06.989
