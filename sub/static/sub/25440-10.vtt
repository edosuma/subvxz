01:30.962 --> 01:32.133
Yeah!

01:32.210 --> 01:34.682
Boy, Lorbs sure do know
how to party.

01:34.759 --> 01:36.112
Huh, Blondie?

01:36.733 --> 01:39.242
- Where's Blondie?
- I'm sure she's on her way.

01:39.319 --> 01:41.261
After all,
who would want to miss this?

01:41.687 --> 01:43.635
(Laughing and grunting)

(Music playing)

01:51.133 --> 01:52.556
Look at this one!

01:52.633 --> 01:54.853
They embroidered
my name on it.

01:54.930 --> 01:57.346
Ooh! And this one,
it must be a... a...

01:57.423 --> 01:59.128
a portrait of whoever made it.

01:59.205 --> 02:03.020
Ooh, look at this,
it's... it's... uh...

02:03.133 --> 02:05.254
I don't know what it is.

02:05.495 --> 02:07.870
I still can't get over

02:07.947 --> 02:10.090
how many there are.

02:11.941 --> 02:14.111
Pascal, this lantern

02:14.188 --> 02:16.910
is decorated
with my father's crest.

02:20.725 --> 02:23.480
(Gasps) It's from my dad.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.444
(Reading) "My dearest Rapunzel..."

KING FREDERIC: <i> It's been seven years
since I last held you in my arms.</i>

02:29.385 --> 02:31.105
<i>In that seven years,</i>

02:31.297 --> 02:33.782
<i>not a moment passes
that I don't think of you,</i>

02:33.859 --> 02:35.542
<i>about how I would give anything</i>

02:35.619 --> 02:38.254
<i>to hold you
just one more time.</i>

02:40.378 --> 02:43.425
<i>Though I still imagine you
as the baby we lost,</i>

02:43.502 --> 02:46.572
<i>I know wherever you are,
you've grown.</i>

02:46.649 --> 02:48.337
<i>But no matter how long...</i>

02:48.414 --> 02:50.034
RAPUNZEL: <i> "How long you are away</i>

02:50.111 --> 02:52.322
"or how far you go,

02:52.399 --> 02:55.660
"know that Corona
will always be your home."

02:57.779 --> 03:00.039
Oh, Dad.

03:01.227 --> 03:03.894
I miss them, Pascal.

03:04.879 --> 03:06.774
(Music playing)

03:08.658 --> 03:12.059
Ha! Thank you,
uncharted island!

03:12.195 --> 03:14.784
Huh, I had no idea
Lance was so graceful.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.494
Wait for it.

03:17.167 --> 03:18.563
(Sniffing)

03:18.641 --> 03:21.707
Um, any...
anyone else smell burning?

03:21.852 --> 03:23.322
(Screams)

03:23.399 --> 03:26.059
- Ow! Ooh! That's hot!
- (Laughter)

03:26.136 --> 03:28.550
I'd give it a seven for effort.

03:28.627 --> 03:31.183
Let the celebration continue!

03:31.260 --> 03:34.074
- (Singing)
- (Music playing)

03:36.110 --> 03:37.945
(Laughing)

03:39.297 --> 03:42.340
May I have this dance, milady?

03:43.352 --> 03:44.805
You bet.

03:55.125 --> 03:59.207
I, um, I just need a moment.

04:02.578 --> 04:04.035
EUGENE: Blondie?

04:06.688 --> 04:08.012
You all right?

04:08.180 --> 04:10.681
It's just these lanterns,

04:10.758 --> 04:12.376
all the celebrating,

04:12.453 --> 04:14.300
they remind me of home.

04:14.433 --> 04:16.904
I was so excited
to see the world

04:16.982 --> 04:19.307
that I guess
I never really thought about

04:19.384 --> 04:21.560
how much
I would miss everyone.

04:21.699 --> 04:23.497
Oh, you're just
a little homesick.

04:23.574 --> 04:25.703
By tomorrow morning,
you'll be just fine.

04:28.342 --> 04:31.441
(Pascal chatters)

04:33.728 --> 04:35.350
- (Despondent squeak)
- (Sighs)

04:35.427 --> 04:37.042
I'm sorry, pal.

04:37.119 --> 04:39.678
I thought I'd be over
being homesick by now.

04:39.755 --> 04:41.053
(Squeaks)

04:41.539 --> 04:43.711
You're right. I should go out

04:43.788 --> 04:45.878
and...
face the day, huh?

04:45.955 --> 04:49.300
Are you up to do
some exploring?

04:52.117 --> 04:55.460
You're right, Pascal,
it's gorgeous.

04:55.537 --> 04:58.531
- The whole island is.
- (Distant bells chiming)

04:58.608 --> 05:00.152
Do you hear that?

05:04.189 --> 05:06.084
(Faint drumming)

05:10.914 --> 05:12.610
(Pascal squeaks)

05:15.486 --> 05:18.495

05:21.125 --> 05:22.754
(Drumming, chiming stops)

05:26.084 --> 05:27.749
What is this?

05:35.030 --> 05:36.929
FREDERIC: <i> Rapunzel...</i>

05:41.151 --> 05:42.418
Dad?

05:42.847 --> 05:46.513
How... How did you...
I mean, what are you...

05:46.590 --> 05:48.655
Oh! You're here!

05:49.032 --> 05:51.308
Rapunzel, how I've missed you.

05:51.385 --> 05:54.214
Oh! I've missed you so much.

05:54.291 --> 05:56.042
I wish I would've known
that you were coming.

05:56.119 --> 05:58.261
I would've planned
a whole celebration

05:58.338 --> 06:01.551
with activities and games and
music and a welcome banner,

06:01.628 --> 06:03.746
- like a giant welcome banner.
- (Laughing)

06:03.823 --> 06:05.696
Rapunzel,
there's no need for that.

06:05.773 --> 06:08.420
Seeing you again
is all that matters.

06:08.497 --> 06:12.293
You have no idea
how happy this makes me.

06:12.370 --> 06:14.597
Since I found you letter
attached to the lantern,

06:14.674 --> 06:17.707
I've been so homesick.

06:17.784 --> 06:19.607
But now that you're here and...

06:19.684 --> 06:21.137
Wait, wait, wait.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.577
How did you get here?

06:22.654 --> 06:24.147
Don't worry about that.

06:24.224 --> 06:27.261
Just know that as long
as you hold this statue,

06:27.338 --> 06:29.124
I'll always be here.

06:29.295 --> 06:33.804
You'll never have
to feel that sadness again.

06:38.304 --> 06:39.672
What?

06:39.870 --> 06:41.724
Did that just happen?

06:41.801 --> 06:42.886
Pascal?

06:45.390 --> 06:48.036
(Owl hooting)

06:50.050 --> 06:51.871
We got a visual. She's coming.

06:51.948 --> 06:53.416
All right, did everyone sign

06:53.493 --> 06:55.018
the cheer-up card for Rapunzel?

06:55.095 --> 06:56.384
- Sure did.
- Me too.

06:56.461 --> 06:58.678
- (Affirmative neigh)
- Shorty?

06:58.755 --> 07:00.051
(Chews, gulps)

07:00.128 --> 07:02.857
(Slurred) In my defense,
let the record show

07:02.934 --> 07:05.655
the card was made of cheese.

07:05.839 --> 07:07.319
The card was not
made of cheese.

07:07.396 --> 07:08.921
Agree to disagree.

07:09.159 --> 07:10.503
Hi, guys!

07:11.142 --> 07:13.473
- Hey, look who cheered up.
- Yup!

07:13.550 --> 07:15.801
And wait
until you see why.

07:15.878 --> 07:19.397
It is only the most
incredible thing ever.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.296
I give it a seven for effort.

07:23.373 --> 07:25.345
Rapunzel, my darling girl.

07:25.422 --> 07:28.171
(Laughs) It's so good to see you, Dad.

07:28.248 --> 07:31.952
See! I mean,
can you believe it?

07:32.581 --> 07:34.952
(Owl hoots)

07:35.096 --> 07:37.780
Why aren't you
more amazed by this?

07:41.265 --> 07:43.647
One second.
Why can't they see you?

07:43.995 --> 07:45.824
She's back... (Nervous chuckle)

07:45.901 --> 07:48.053
but I don't know if she's "all there."

07:48.130 --> 07:49.254
Wait a minute.

07:49.331 --> 07:51.357
Maybe you have to be holding it

07:51.434 --> 07:52.640
to see anything.

07:53.413 --> 07:55.236
- (Idol chiming)
- (Chuckles)

07:55.313 --> 07:58.391
Blondie, I think your homesickness
might be getting to your...

07:58.468 --> 08:00.560
Sweet tomatoes! The royal yacht!

08:00.637 --> 08:04.335
And look! My likeness is
carved upon its wondrous bow.

08:04.425 --> 08:06.391
Now we can get off
the island and sail.

08:06.468 --> 08:08.873
Blondie, you fill my world
with amazing things.

08:08.950 --> 08:11.405
You know that?
The statue brings all the happy.

08:11.482 --> 08:13.241
(Annoyed nickering)

08:13.318 --> 08:15.311
(Triumphant grunting)

08:15.440 --> 08:16.598
Nicely done,

08:16.675 --> 08:18.218
but I don't think
I taught you this.

08:18.295 --> 08:20.413
I picked up a thing or two
out here on the road.

08:20.858 --> 08:21.882
Ya!

08:22.013 --> 08:24.176
CASSANDRA: Whoo! Good one!

08:34.591 --> 08:36.123
(Grunting)

08:36.260 --> 08:38.335
Cut it out,
would you? Ow!

08:38.412 --> 08:40.263
(Cries of pain continue)

08:40.340 --> 08:42.556
I don't know
what kind of juice this is,

08:42.633 --> 08:43.859
but keep it coming.

08:43.936 --> 08:45.397
(Gulping)

08:45.520 --> 08:47.815
Agree to agree.

08:48.134 --> 08:50.596
- Eck!
- Eck!

08:51.365 --> 08:52.647
Hmm.

08:56.009 --> 08:57.444
(Sighs)

08:57.563 --> 08:58.656
(Laughing)

08:58.733 --> 09:00.770
LANCE:
He's in love with that bird.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.822
(Seagull squawks)

09:02.899 --> 09:04.689
Uh, uh, okay!

09:04.766 --> 09:05.838
Give it back!

09:05.915 --> 09:07.863
CASSANDRA: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What gives, Raps?

09:07.940 --> 09:10.980
Yeah, Blondie, since when
are you not into sharing?

09:11.057 --> 09:12.650
What? (Laughs)

09:12.727 --> 09:14.918
Not into sharing?
Me?

09:14.995 --> 09:16.439
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:16.516 --> 09:18.489
No, I love to share.

09:18.566 --> 09:22.327
It's just that
I don't want to use up, uh,

09:22.404 --> 09:24.707
all of the magic all at once.

09:24.784 --> 09:26.989
You know? Okay, bye.

09:28.908 --> 09:31.799
Mom! Finally! Oh!

09:31.876 --> 09:35.121
How I've missed you!
I've missed you so much.

09:35.198 --> 09:37.028
You have no idea.

09:37.294 --> 09:38.360
Ulf!

09:39.586 --> 09:42.714
You know, I didn't think
that I would miss the miming,

09:42.791 --> 09:43.766
but I did!

09:43.912 --> 09:48.908
And, uh, Friedborg,
you're... you're here!

09:48.985 --> 09:52.755
It is so wonderful
to have all of you here.

09:52.832 --> 09:56.031
Ugh! It's like they were holding
onto that statue forever

09:56.108 --> 09:59.525
and I would have done
anything to get it back.

09:59.602 --> 10:01.797
I will do anything
to get that statue back.

10:01.874 --> 10:03.087
You create a diversion.

10:03.164 --> 10:05.856
- I'll sneak around the side of the hut.
- (Neighs)

10:05.977 --> 10:07.644
What do you mean
I should be the diversion?

10:07.721 --> 10:09.472
- (Neighs)
- What?

10:09.549 --> 10:13.205
Me in a tutu is more distracting
than you in a tutu?

10:13.282 --> 10:15.205
(Laughs) I beg to differ, horse.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.002
I got it.
I'll ask her on a date.

10:17.079 --> 10:19.053
Then sweet talk her
into giving me the statue,

10:19.130 --> 10:21.282
and if that doesn't work,
I go full smolder.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.594
The blaze!

10:26.963 --> 10:29.197
Then I swipe it
while she's lost in the magic.

10:29.274 --> 10:30.697
(Laughing)

10:30.774 --> 10:33.707
- (Laughing) This is diabolical.
- "Smolder, swipe,

10:33.784 --> 10:35.535
"lost in magic,

10:35.612 --> 10:37.577
ha ha ha."

10:38.298 --> 10:39.774
(Giggles)

10:40.173 --> 10:41.282
(Gasps)

10:46.047 --> 10:47.240
(Knocking)

10:47.317 --> 10:48.880
EUGENE: Blondie, hello.

10:49.287 --> 10:51.460
Can you come out? (Giggles)

10:54.699 --> 10:58.101
"Date, smolder, and..." Ooh.

10:59.716 --> 11:01.238
Shh!

11:01.835 --> 11:04.450
Pascal,
they're coming after the statue.

11:04.527 --> 11:06.694
Huh, well, they're not gonna get it.

11:06.771 --> 11:08.919
Don't they know that
I'm the one

11:08.996 --> 11:10.601
that needs it the most?

11:10.785 --> 11:12.959
RAPUNZEL: Uh, you just
want me to come out

11:13.036 --> 11:15.404
so you can have the idol.
Ha ha!

11:15.481 --> 11:17.145
- I'm on to you.
- What?

11:17.222 --> 11:20.364
No! Are you crazy?
That is not true.

11:20.441 --> 11:23.418
We collectively miss you.
Right, guys?

11:26.289 --> 11:29.176
You see?
And, yes, were you to come out,

11:29.253 --> 11:31.061
it would be
a fantastic opportunity

11:31.138 --> 11:33.426
to pass the ol' magical statue around

11:33.503 --> 11:34.824
and experience
the ultimate happiness

11:34.901 --> 11:36.129
that we all long
for deep in our hearts,

11:36.206 --> 11:38.755
but I don't think anyone out
here even thought of that.

11:38.832 --> 11:39.862
Did we?

11:40.855 --> 11:42.725
RAPUNZEL: Okay. I will come out,

11:42.802 --> 11:46.679
but only for a second.

11:47.135 --> 11:48.459
There's my girl.

11:48.536 --> 11:49.979
Say, I was wondering...

11:50.056 --> 11:52.617
It's been awhile since we've had a date.

11:53.956 --> 11:55.343
What the...

11:57.522 --> 11:59.717
Blondie,
can we focus on the romance?

11:59.863 --> 12:00.941
Oh no.

12:01.035 --> 12:02.491
(Chuckles, shushes)

12:02.568 --> 12:03.963
(Screams)

12:04.050 --> 12:06.030
- (Grunting)
- (Thudding)

12:06.107 --> 12:08.830
Ow, watch the hook, klutz!

12:10.070 --> 12:11.692
Hey, you give that back.

12:11.769 --> 12:14.168
- Never! This belongs...
- LANCE: Hello, ladies.

12:14.285 --> 12:16.704
I hope I'm not interrupting, but...

12:16.781 --> 12:19.350
Uh, what does this say?

12:19.427 --> 12:20.637
(Muttering)

12:20.714 --> 12:22.764
- Would you get out of here?
- Fine, fine.

12:22.841 --> 12:24.844
I can see
when I'm not wanted.

12:24.921 --> 12:26.441
(Gasps)

12:27.321 --> 12:29.070
- Thief!
- Gah!

12:36.062 --> 12:37.139
(Squeaks)

12:38.065 --> 12:39.427
I got it. I got it.

12:39.504 --> 12:40.657
Aha!

12:40.734 --> 12:41.903
(Shrieks)

12:43.260 --> 12:45.655
Give me that statue, you nag!

12:46.206 --> 12:47.764
It belongs to me!

12:47.841 --> 12:49.321
I ripped it off fair and square.

12:49.398 --> 12:50.642
Using my gimmick.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.653
We've got to do something

12:52.730 --> 12:54.799
before they tear
each other apart.

12:54.876 --> 12:56.502
(Overlapping shouts)

12:56.607 --> 12:58.210
Stop!

13:01.303 --> 13:03.970
Thank you for the bath,
my good man.

13:04.047 --> 13:05.885
It's been ages.

13:07.045 --> 13:08.284
That's better.

13:08.361 --> 13:10.481
Look at what this has done to us.

13:10.558 --> 13:12.431
Yesterday,
we were celebrating,

13:12.508 --> 13:15.666
and today, we are throwing
punches at each other.

13:16.803 --> 13:18.960
The only sensible solution

13:19.037 --> 13:22.702
is to get rid of this statue
once and for all.

13:22.779 --> 13:25.642
And since it was me
who found it in the first place,

13:25.818 --> 13:28.385
I think I should be the one
to get rid of it.

13:28.670 --> 13:30.166
I will not like it,

13:30.243 --> 13:34.650
but nothing is more important
than our friendships.

13:34.727 --> 13:35.811
Yeah?

13:37.146 --> 13:38.216
Thank you.

13:38.412 --> 13:41.456
I know
that wasn't easy for any of you,

13:41.533 --> 13:45.166
but...
this has to be done.

13:46.235 --> 13:47.498
(Laughing)

13:47.575 --> 13:48.606
Suckers!

13:48.683 --> 13:50.614
They fell for the oldest trick
in the book,

13:50.691 --> 13:52.593
eh, Pascal? (Laughs)

13:52.670 --> 13:54.382
Don't give me that look.

13:54.459 --> 13:55.545
I mean, yeah, sure.

13:55.622 --> 13:58.900
I could get rid of the idol,
but why?

13:59.092 --> 14:00.773
So I can be sad again?

14:00.850 --> 14:03.710
What is so wrong with something
that makes me happy?

14:03.912 --> 14:05.943
Is that what you want?
Huh?

14:06.020 --> 14:08.674
You want me to be miserable
for the rest of my life?

14:10.263 --> 14:14.127
Good. Now speaking of the idol,

14:15.142 --> 14:19.695
Oh, Lady Crowley!
Hi, is that a new dress?

14:19.772 --> 14:22.630
It isn't, really? Because it looks new.

14:25.427 --> 14:27.101
What's taking her so long?

14:27.178 --> 14:30.569
(Gasps)
I bet she double-crossed us.

14:30.646 --> 14:33.170
Genius!
Exactly how I would've done it.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.106
Listen, that statue was hard
for all of us to let go of,

14:36.183 --> 14:38.029
but none of us has
a stronger will than Rapunzel,

14:38.106 --> 14:41.248
and I'm sure
that she's just, you know,

14:41.325 --> 14:42.937
really, really, really making sure

14:43.014 --> 14:44.718
nobody ever finds it again.

14:45.412 --> 14:48.095
What's new, Friedborg?
You're looking wonderful.

14:48.172 --> 14:50.084
Sweet Goginslpotz!

14:50.161 --> 14:51.654
It is as I feared.

14:51.731 --> 14:54.384
The idol has indeed taken
hold of her.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.873
We must intervene. Rapunzel!

14:56.950 --> 14:59.600
Please, I beg you
to put the statue down.

14:59.677 --> 15:01.037
You are under the spell

15:01.114 --> 15:03.735
of the idol of Vershaftsbezeigungengien.

15:03.812 --> 15:05.302
The longer you hold it,

15:05.379 --> 15:07.662
the stronger its grip on you
will become.

15:07.739 --> 15:10.527
Ha, hold that thought,
Friedborg.

15:10.604 --> 15:13.152
It seems
I have been betrayed.

15:13.229 --> 15:16.446
You led them to me?
How could you?

15:16.523 --> 15:18.516
Do not be angry with Pascal.

15:18.593 --> 15:20.696
He has indeed saved your life.

15:20.773 --> 15:23.444
The idol of Vershaftsbezeigungengien

15:23.521 --> 15:25.224
destroys all who pursue it.

15:25.301 --> 15:28.359
The idol was created
by a mystical Lorb warlock,

15:28.436 --> 15:31.747
<i>Horb. It was Horb's dream
to eliminate sadness</i>

15:31.824 --> 15:34.404
<i>and the idol was
the fruit of that quest.</i>

15:34.481 --> 15:36.250
<i>Though his intentions were noble,</i>

15:36.327 --> 15:37.641
<i>Horb never considered</i>

15:37.718 --> 15:40.240
<i>that sadness is
a much needed emotion.</i>

15:40.317 --> 15:42.443
<i>And so
the idol's magic backfired</i>

15:42.520 --> 15:45.629
<i>and poisoned the minds
of every Lorb he loved.</i>

15:45.706 --> 15:48.439
<i>His only hope was to
perform a cleansing ritual</i>

15:48.516 --> 15:50.277
<i>atop the temple of Torb,</i>

15:50.354 --> 15:53.103
<i>but before he could, Horb lost the idol,</i>

15:53.180 --> 15:55.856
<i>dooming himself
to a lifetime of sadness.</i>

15:55.933 --> 15:59.732
<i>If it is not stopped,
the same fate awaits you.</i>

15:59.899 --> 16:02.869
The only way
to be truly free of the idol

16:02.946 --> 16:06.292
is to know that happiness
does not come from a thing,

16:06.369 --> 16:08.626
but from within your heart.

16:08.741 --> 16:12.396
The same thing is happening
to me and all of my friends.

16:14.111 --> 16:16.097
I'm so sorry, Pascal.

16:16.174 --> 16:18.214
I will take the idol
to the temple

16:18.291 --> 16:19.724
and perform the ritual.

16:19.801 --> 16:21.849
It's not safe for you to go yet.

16:21.926 --> 16:25.281
Chorb! Dorb!
The Greufenmittens!

16:39.773 --> 16:41.635
What are you doing?

16:44.577 --> 16:46.619
Hello, Rapunzel.

16:46.834 --> 16:47.973
What?

16:48.050 --> 16:49.169
I need your father

16:49.246 --> 16:51.436
- to help me with a little experiment.
- Rapunzel, help!

16:51.513 --> 16:53.342
Get away from him, Varian!

16:53.419 --> 16:54.843
The Greufenmittens!

16:57.580 --> 16:59.506
Change of plans, Rapunzel.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.367
You will be our prisoner

17:01.444 --> 17:04.459
and the idol Vershaftsbezeigungengien

17:04.536 --> 17:07.068
shall stay with us.

17:10.165 --> 17:13.209
Pascal, stop looking at me like that.

17:14.579 --> 17:16.438
Okay, fine! I know! I know!

17:16.515 --> 17:20.896
I blew the chance to get rid of the
idol of versha... vorken... vein...

17:20.973 --> 17:21.922
the idol...

17:21.999 --> 17:24.040
and now I'm still homesick,

17:24.117 --> 17:26.940
I lost the statue,
deceived all of my friends,

17:27.017 --> 17:28.633
and endangered the island!

17:28.710 --> 17:30.973
See, I admitted it.
There, are you happy?

17:31.307 --> 17:35.155
(Clamoring)

17:36.413 --> 17:38.960
- Blondie, there you are.
- Eugene, Cass.

17:39.037 --> 17:40.669
Oh, thank goodness.

17:40.746 --> 17:42.189
How did you find me?

17:42.266 --> 17:44.103
Everyone was worried
when you didn't come back.

17:44.180 --> 17:45.242
What is with the Lorbs?

17:45.319 --> 17:46.581
Why would they do this to you?

17:46.658 --> 17:49.429
- It's the statue.
- What? Because you got rid of it?

17:49.506 --> 17:51.712
None of what the idol
showed us was real anyway.

17:51.789 --> 17:53.273
It was just false happiness.

17:53.350 --> 17:55.392
They should be thanking you
for getting rid of it.

17:55.469 --> 17:57.999
Yeah, about that...

17:58.076 --> 18:00.369
Raps, what did you do?

18:00.595 --> 18:02.288
I lied to everyone.

18:02.365 --> 18:04.926
I just wanted that happy feeling again.

18:05.003 --> 18:08.295
Wait, so you didn't get rid of it?

18:08.372 --> 18:10.983
- (Evil Laughter)
- The Lorbs have it now,

18:11.060 --> 18:13.140
and they're growing
more hostile by the minute.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.661
So once you free me,

18:14.738 --> 18:17.198
I can take it to
the top of the temple and...

18:18.491 --> 18:20.198
Oh, come on!

18:20.275 --> 18:23.138
- (SQUEAKS)
- What, Pascal?

18:23.502 --> 18:24.838
My rope's loose.

18:24.915 --> 18:25.849
Maybe I can...

18:25.926 --> 18:28.629
- (Clamoring)
- That statue belongs to us.

18:28.706 --> 18:30.866
We laugh at your statue claim.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.929
Ha-ha.

18:32.006 --> 18:34.220
Nobody laughs at my claim
and gets away with it.

18:34.297 --> 18:35.682
Get 'em, Cass.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.268
RAPUNZEL: There's the statue.

18:48.116 --> 18:50.385
Do you think we're within 70 feet?

18:53.685 --> 18:55.381
Quick, give me the bag.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.281
Okay, all we got to do

18:59.358 --> 19:01.606
is get this idol
to the top of that temple

19:01.683 --> 19:03.072
before they see us.

19:03.149 --> 19:05.106
Doesn't look too bad.

19:05.938 --> 19:07.269
Give me back the idol!

19:07.346 --> 19:08.803
How can I give it to you

19:08.880 --> 19:10.233
if I don't have it?

19:10.310 --> 19:12.434
You don't have it?
But then who do have it?

19:12.511 --> 19:15.336
Alfons! Alfons! Look!

19:16.731 --> 19:19.503
Oh, no! Look, she's trying
to destroy the idol

19:19.580 --> 19:21.893
of Vershaftsbezeigungengien!

19:21.979 --> 19:23.980
(Shouts)

19:25.089 --> 19:26.944
ALFONS: Get her!

19:28.151 --> 19:29.679
(Chattering)

19:31.643 --> 19:33.439
There it is.

19:38.961 --> 19:40.321
- (dol Chimes)
- FREDERIC: Rapunzel!

19:40.398 --> 19:42.814
Please! Please don't do this.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.644
What if we never see you again?

19:44.721 --> 19:46.283
We miss you so much.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.631
Don't you miss us?

19:47.708 --> 19:50.223
I... I... I have to.

19:50.306 --> 19:53.303
I'm afraid I can't let you do that!

19:54.555 --> 19:56.974
All right, Blondie, hand it over...

19:57.327 --> 20:02.592
Please, I miss you all so
much, but I have to do this.

20:02.810 --> 20:05.123
Let's get her
while she's distracted.

20:07.690 --> 20:09.216
Come on, frog, out of the way.

20:09.293 --> 20:10.522
Ow!

20:10.684 --> 20:12.290
(Cass grunts)

20:12.367 --> 20:14.696
- Why?
- You little!

20:14.773 --> 20:16.396
(Squeaks)

20:16.763 --> 20:20.139
Cass, Eugene, please!

20:20.216 --> 20:21.998
We have to help her destroy it.

20:22.075 --> 20:23.649
You want to be like them?

20:23.726 --> 20:25.600
(Clamoring shouts)

20:25.677 --> 20:28.706
It's okay, Blondie, we're here to help.

20:31.213 --> 20:33.472
You are not my father!

20:33.549 --> 20:35.316
You are just an illusion.

20:35.393 --> 20:38.990
The people I love are
what make me happy,

20:39.067 --> 20:41.126
and I won't let you
hurt them anymore.

20:41.203 --> 20:44.476
Rapunzel, if you destroy the idol,

20:44.553 --> 20:47.319
you'll never be happy again!

20:47.396 --> 20:50.068
Happiness doesn't come
from a thing!

20:50.145 --> 20:53.024
It comes from inside my heart!

20:55.661 --> 20:57.264
Rapunzel!

21:15.236 --> 21:16.735
How you feeling?

21:17.830 --> 21:20.227
(Sighs) Homesick.

21:20.997 --> 21:23.782
But I think
I have a way to deal with it.

21:25.944 --> 21:29.017
<i>I'm still sad
to be so far away from home</i>

21:29.094 --> 21:30.969
<i>and there's nothing wrong
with that.</i>

21:31.046 --> 21:33.337
<i>I can be independent</i>

21:33.477 --> 21:36.767
<i>and see the world
and still miss home.</i>

21:36.844 --> 21:38.518
<i>That's just part of life.</i>

21:38.595 --> 21:41.837
<i>Nobody can be happy
all the time.</i>

21:41.914 --> 21:44.199
<i>And if I'm sad,
it's a reminder</i>

21:44.276 --> 21:47.016
<i>that I love my family.</i>

21:47.093 --> 21:48.827
<i>When I miss you the most,</i>

21:48.904 --> 21:50.952
<i>I have my friends to lean on.</i>

21:51.465 --> 21:53.094
<i>Until I see you again,</i>

21:53.171 --> 21:56.392
<i>you are always in my heart.</i>

21:57.081 --> 21:59.933
