WEBVTT

00:00.093 --> 00:03.812
- You're my student.
- Not anymore, I'm not.

00:03.863 --> 00:05.731
This is so not fair.

00:07.550 --> 00:10.368
I've never stepped outside
of my marriage before.

00:10.386 --> 00:11.419
Who in their right minds

00:11.471 --> 00:14.973
would step out on his royal deanness?

00:15.007 --> 00:18.042
Oh, I am flattered, but I...

00:18.060 --> 00:19.444
Mmm!

00:19.479 --> 00:21.480
And I'm wet.

00:21.514 --> 00:24.266
Ooh, hard and wet... that's
a winning combination.

00:28.154 --> 00:29.321
Hey!

00:30.439 --> 00:32.491
What? Not even a hello.

00:32.525 --> 00:35.243
What, were you just
gonna leave me behind?

00:35.278 --> 00:36.995
You're saying we just
pack up and leave L.A.?

00:37.029 --> 00:39.197
The three of us move
back to New York together?

00:39.231 --> 00:40.832
Yeah, end of the semester.

00:40.867 --> 00:42.501
For the first time in my
life, I'm actually happy,

00:42.535 --> 00:43.919
and now you want me to pack up

00:43.953 --> 00:45.036
and move someplace I have no friends?

00:45.070 --> 00:46.254
What did you say your name was again?

00:46.289 --> 00:48.790
She didn't. Next.

00:48.841 --> 00:50.125
Aaaah!

00:50.176 --> 00:53.011
Runkle is ankling!

00:53.045 --> 00:56.715
Rick fucking Springfield
is here in my house

00:56.749 --> 00:57.933
right fucking now?

00:57.967 --> 00:59.601
'80s pop legend Rick Springfield

00:59.635 --> 01:00.936
is in there stealing your girl.

01:00.970 --> 01:03.522
You have to out-fuck Rick Springfield.

01:03.556 --> 01:05.557
The only time I ever made
Marcy squeal like that

01:05.591 --> 01:07.442
was when I put the ring on her finger.

01:10.396 --> 01:12.614
Destroy me, Rick Springfield!

01:14.266 --> 01:15.767
Christ on the cross, Hank.

01:15.785 --> 01:17.903
My lungs are about to explode.

01:17.937 --> 01:19.204
You didn't have to come.

01:19.238 --> 01:20.372
You could have stayed home

01:20.406 --> 01:22.490
and made the fucky-fucky
with the boss lady.

01:22.542 --> 01:24.326
Hey, laugh all you want.

01:24.377 --> 01:25.460
How many people can say

01:25.494 --> 01:26.545
they've been in the same honey pot

01:26.579 --> 01:27.629
as Jack Nicholson?

01:27.663 --> 01:29.297
How many people in the l.A. phone book?

01:29.332 --> 01:30.715
Ah, who am I kidding?

01:30.750 --> 01:33.218
I used to be Charlie Runkle.

01:33.252 --> 01:35.053
Now...

01:35.087 --> 01:37.505
I'm Runkle!

01:37.557 --> 01:39.975
Hmm. Look at us, Runkle.

01:40.009 --> 01:41.476
L.A. has made us soft.

01:41.510 --> 01:43.645
You used to be able to run for
the lexington avenue express

01:43.679 --> 01:45.263
with the best of them,

01:45.297 --> 01:47.482
elbowing investment
wankers out of the way.

01:47.516 --> 01:48.733
Your cell phone in one hand,

01:48.768 --> 01:50.068
your mammoth ball sack in the other,

01:50.102 --> 01:51.903
a Hollywood reporter between your teeth,

01:51.938 --> 01:53.822
not even breathing so you wouldn't

01:53.856 --> 01:55.774
inhale the fucking piss stench.

01:55.808 --> 01:57.442
Jesus Christ, we're out
here 'cause of Karen,

01:57.476 --> 01:58.660
Aren't we?

01:58.694 --> 01:59.861
That's right.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.696
The Gods have seen fit
to give me another shot

02:01.747 --> 02:02.864
with the soul mate.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.866
She's in New York,
feathering the nest,

02:04.917 --> 02:06.334
and I got to be ready for her,

02:06.369 --> 02:09.086
mentally... physically...

02:09.121 --> 02:10.505
sexually.

02:10.538 --> 02:12.156
Maybe it's time to stop banging

02:12.174 --> 02:13.675
the entire college campus.

02:13.709 --> 02:14.843
Right you are...

02:14.877 --> 02:16.678
Motherfucker.

02:16.712 --> 02:18.380
Right as rain.

02:18.431 --> 02:21.016
It's time for me to grow
up, do the right thing.

02:21.050 --> 02:23.435
Easier said than done, though, huh?

02:23.469 --> 02:26.104
Nah, Jackie's 23.

02:26.138 --> 02:28.273
She's not looking to make
those breasteses exclusive.

02:28.307 --> 02:30.141
And Jill, she knows I
got a snip and a baby.

02:30.175 --> 02:33.695
And Felicia, I'm just
a daydream to her...

02:33.729 --> 02:35.530
an escape hatch from the deanery.

02:35.564 --> 02:37.399
Shit, I can get this done in one day...

02:37.450 --> 02:38.867
breakfast, lunch, dinner,

02:38.901 --> 02:41.569
then home for some
cybersex with the soul mate.

02:41.621 --> 02:43.204
That's not a bad idea.

02:43.239 --> 02:45.123
You kidding?
It's a terrible idea.

02:45.157 --> 02:46.791
The lighting is subpar,

02:46.826 --> 02:48.877
very difficult to properly showcase

02:48.911 --> 02:50.128
one's dangling majesty.

02:50.162 --> 02:51.913
But it sure beats phone-ilingus.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:39.929 --> 03:41.930
You wanted to see me,
professor Moody?

03:41.964 --> 03:43.848
Jackie, my prized pupil.

03:43.883 --> 03:45.517
Come on in. Have a
seat and shut the door.

03:45.551 --> 03:47.519
Or... or wait. Don't...
don't shut the door.

03:47.553 --> 03:49.771
I don't know.
What... what do you think?

03:49.805 --> 03:52.440
Well, I think you're
more of a thrill-seeker

03:52.475 --> 03:55.110
than I thought if you want
to fuck me with the door open.

03:55.144 --> 03:56.928
I know. You know, I... I think,

03:56.946 --> 03:58.780
a... as you got to know
me, you'd find that I was

03:58.814 --> 03:59.981
pretty much of a fuddy-duddy,

04:00.032 --> 04:01.399
just an old-fashioned...

04:01.433 --> 04:03.735
Yeah, I actually wanted
to talk to you about that.

04:03.769 --> 04:05.904
I think that we need to
spice things up a little bit.

04:05.938 --> 04:08.490
I'm getting sort of tired
of being on top all the time.

04:08.541 --> 04:10.909
Oh, well, don't...
don't knock cowgirl.

04:10.943 --> 04:12.744
That's... that's my favorite "posish."

04:12.778 --> 04:14.662
You know, I do some of my
best work from the bottom.

04:14.714 --> 04:16.214
- You know why?
- Why?

04:16.248 --> 04:17.298
I got my hands free.

04:17.333 --> 04:20.969
It's like sexual bluetooth.

04:21.003 --> 04:23.555
I missed you.
It's been a while.

04:23.589 --> 04:24.839
Yeah, about that...

04:24.890 --> 04:25.957
did you miss me?

04:25.975 --> 04:28.476
Well, sure I did,

04:28.511 --> 04:30.011
tons.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.931
Um... look, here's the thing.

04:32.965 --> 04:35.817
Oh, my God. Seriously?

04:35.851 --> 04:37.852
You're trying to end this thing.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.237
Uh, a thing, is it?

04:39.271 --> 04:42.657
Wow, well, it sounds to
me like you're dumping me.

04:42.691 --> 04:45.276
That's harsh when you put it that way,

04:45.310 --> 04:46.494
but, uh, that's exactly right,

04:46.529 --> 04:47.862
in a manner of speaking.

04:47.913 --> 04:50.198
You're a lovely girl, the
loveliest of the loveliest.

04:50.249 --> 04:52.367
This is because of that woman,
isn't it?

04:52.418 --> 04:54.002
Who was in class the other day...

04:54.036 --> 04:55.920
your old lady.

04:55.955 --> 04:57.839
That's the woman what done it, yes.

04:57.873 --> 04:59.591
So, um...

04:59.625 --> 05:01.342
you're back with her now?

05:01.377 --> 05:03.128
She is the mother of my child.

05:03.162 --> 05:06.848
Oh, and she doesn't mind
you sleeping with students

05:06.882 --> 05:09.333
who aren't very much
older than that child?

05:09.351 --> 05:11.719
Well, that is... low.

05:11.771 --> 05:14.338
Oh, coming from the
guy who loved my work

05:14.356 --> 05:15.557
and found me
oh-so-talented,

05:15.608 --> 05:18.226
but now has grown tired of fucking me.

05:18.277 --> 05:20.812
Really? Have I... have
I made you feel that way?

05:20.846 --> 05:22.063
It's cool. Don't sweat it.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.849
It's not like it was serious, right?

05:24.867 --> 05:25.984
Just fun?

05:26.018 --> 05:28.286
Fun it was.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.905
Besides, I'm a sex worker, right?

05:30.956 --> 05:32.040
What does that mean?

05:32.074 --> 05:34.125
Don't worry about me.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.376
I can't get hurt.

05:35.411 --> 05:38.296
I'm just a hot piece of stripper ass.

05:38.330 --> 05:40.298
You have your fun with
me, and then you're done.

05:40.332 --> 05:42.584
I got it, loud and clear.

05:42.635 --> 05:44.052
I don't like the way that sounds.

05:44.086 --> 05:46.087
Well, maybe I don't
like the way it feels.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.389
Jackie, I'm sorry.

05:48.424 --> 05:49.757
Sorry.

05:49.809 --> 05:55.713
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

05:55.731 --> 05:57.732
No need to make a fuss.

05:57.766 --> 05:59.517
We can handle this like adults.

05:59.551 --> 06:01.486
In fact, since I'm...

06:01.520 --> 06:02.937
right here...

06:02.988 --> 06:04.072
Mm-hmm.

06:04.106 --> 06:06.858
Why not just, uh,
blow you one more time?

06:06.892 --> 06:09.994
Oh. Well...

06:10.029 --> 06:11.996
No, that's really not necessary.

06:12.031 --> 06:14.332
Oh, come on,
just let the sex worker

06:14.366 --> 06:16.084
do what the sex worker does best.

06:16.118 --> 06:17.335
No, no, no, no.

06:17.369 --> 06:18.503
Moody, I...

06:18.537 --> 06:22.340
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,
what is going on here?

06:22.374 --> 06:25.960
Oh!
This is so not what it seems.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.847
I knew it. I knew you
were a depraved lunatic.

06:28.881 --> 06:30.632
Well, that may very well be the case,

06:30.683 --> 06:32.383
but things are not
always as they appear.

06:32.417 --> 06:35.353
Good God, man,
your fly is open.

06:35.387 --> 06:38.306
Thank you for embarrassing
me in front of my student.

06:38.357 --> 06:41.559
What do you have to say
for yourself, Jackie?

06:41.593 --> 06:43.528
Well, he said he'd give me an "a."

06:43.562 --> 06:45.530
Oh, that is some fucked-up
shit right there, woman.

06:45.564 --> 06:46.731
Reverse course.

06:46.765 --> 06:48.700
I'm gonna have you drawn and quartered.

06:48.734 --> 06:50.952
Maybe Jackie's gonna
want to press charges

06:50.986 --> 06:52.237
against the aging degenerate

06:52.271 --> 06:54.038
who compromised her college experience.

06:54.073 --> 06:55.156
Maybe I will.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.541
What the fuck?

06:56.575 --> 06:58.326
But I can't.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.161
Why on Earth not?

07:00.212 --> 07:02.080
'Cause I was just kidding.

07:02.114 --> 07:04.465
You were kidding?

07:04.500 --> 07:06.417
Look, I'm sorry,
but this is ridiculous.

07:06.451 --> 07:08.386
He was just giving me notes on a story.

07:08.420 --> 07:09.721
We were talking

07:09.755 --> 07:12.173
about the ending, actually,
of the story, right?

07:12.224 --> 07:13.258
Mm-Hmm. Yes.

07:13.292 --> 07:15.226
- And he thinks it's over.
- Right.

07:15.261 --> 07:18.062
But I know that it's just begun.

07:18.097 --> 07:19.230
Right.

07:19.265 --> 07:21.182
But don't worry,
Dean Koons, really.

07:21.233 --> 07:24.319
He's never done anything
even remotely inappropriate.

07:24.353 --> 07:26.854
Really, he's very boring

07:26.906 --> 07:29.274
and so not my type.

07:29.308 --> 07:31.326
I like them darker,

07:31.360 --> 07:33.027
handsomer.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.496
God, you have great eyebrows, sir.

07:35.531 --> 07:37.832
A girl could really get
lost in those things.

07:37.866 --> 07:39.417
He's got, uh, pretty blue
eyes, too, doesn't he?

07:39.451 --> 07:40.668
Gorgeous.

07:40.703 --> 07:42.253
Well, thank you.
Thank you, Jackie.

07:42.288 --> 07:43.254
That's very kind of you.

07:43.289 --> 07:44.255
You're welcome.

07:44.290 --> 07:46.007
Thanks for the help.

07:46.041 --> 07:48.426
I'll show myself out.

07:53.882 --> 07:55.800
You have a thunderous
erection right now, don't you?

07:55.834 --> 07:57.135
Ohh!

07:59.605 --> 08:02.223
I'll close the door,
give you some privacy.

08:04.977 --> 08:07.946
Oh, yeah. That's... oh,
that's mama's sweet spot.

08:07.980 --> 08:09.513
Lower. Ah, lower.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.816
Ah! Another two inches,
I'll read your spec script.

08:11.850 --> 08:13.284
Oh, no, I don't do that.

08:13.319 --> 08:14.702
Oh, you're one of those, huh?

08:14.737 --> 08:17.405
No happy endings,
just cliff-hangers.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.990
Well, get the fuck out of here!

08:19.024 --> 08:20.992
I've grown weary.
I have work to do.

08:21.026 --> 08:24.045
Runkle!
I need you on my carpet!

08:26.365 --> 08:28.967
Crazy bitch.

08:29.001 --> 08:30.635
Morning, Sue.

08:30.669 --> 08:33.587
Agh! That guy...
fired up the grill

08:33.639 --> 08:35.539
and walked out of here
with an uncooked wiener.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.225
Can you believe that?

08:37.259 --> 08:38.726
It's what happens when buddhists

08:38.760 --> 08:40.260
commandeer a profession

08:40.312 --> 08:43.398
that rightfully belongs
to well-hung swedes.

08:43.432 --> 08:44.732
So it is.

08:44.767 --> 08:46.434
What about you?

08:46.485 --> 08:47.769
Have you emptied the chamber today?

08:47.820 --> 08:49.487
Well, as a matter of fact...

08:49.521 --> 08:51.606
Of course you have.
You're Runkle.

08:51.657 --> 08:55.660
You'd whack it to a
cat dancing on Youtube.

08:55.694 --> 08:57.395
But I'm in the mood.

08:57.413 --> 08:59.697
Want to fire off another round, huh?

08:59.731 --> 09:00.999
Phone call for you, Sue.

09:01.033 --> 09:02.583
Rhonda, you know better
than to interrupt me

09:02.618 --> 09:04.085
when I'm entertaining a gentleman.

09:04.119 --> 09:05.336
It's him.

09:05.371 --> 09:06.954
Him?

09:07.006 --> 09:08.039
Mm-hmm.

09:08.073 --> 09:10.508
Everybody out.

09:10.542 --> 09:13.011
Uh-Huh.

09:15.381 --> 09:17.215
Mm-Hmm.

09:17.249 --> 09:19.017
How you doing?

09:20.853 --> 09:23.438
Everything good out here?
You... you hip-pocketing anyone?

09:23.472 --> 09:25.556
That was always my move as an assistant.

09:26.942 --> 09:30.028
I know she's seen your penis.

09:30.062 --> 09:31.779
Guess what, Rhonda?

09:31.814 --> 09:33.114
She's not alone.

09:33.148 --> 09:35.233
11,000 hits on redtube.

09:35.267 --> 09:36.784
Whoo.

09:38.370 --> 09:41.489
Don't go anywhere, Runkle.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.291
I need you.

09:49.948 --> 09:51.332
Jillybean.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.052
Nice to see you.

09:54.086 --> 09:56.554
- Wow, classy.
- Ah.

09:56.588 --> 09:59.057
Moody, real tablecloths.

09:59.091 --> 10:00.591
You trying to tell me something?

10:00.625 --> 10:03.394
'Cause I didn't even think
we were dating, per se.

10:03.429 --> 10:05.897
That's interesting, because...

10:05.931 --> 10:07.348
I've been doing some thinking,

10:07.399 --> 10:08.850
- and I wanted to...
- Yeah, me too.

10:08.901 --> 10:10.268
- You have?
- Mm-Hmm.

10:10.302 --> 10:12.186
Ladies first.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.488
Actually, not that much thinking,

10:13.522 --> 10:14.772
just a medium amount of thinking,

10:14.806 --> 10:16.307
'cause too much with the thinking,

10:16.325 --> 10:17.608
that does me in.

10:17.642 --> 10:18.809
That's how I jinx things.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.661
So now I'm just taking it slow,

10:20.696 --> 10:22.813
going day by day.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.482
Mm-Hmm.
Mm-Hmm.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.367
What were you gonna say?

10:30.255 --> 10:32.373
Okay.

10:32.424 --> 10:33.824
Okay, look, here's the thing.

10:33.842 --> 10:37.345
Oh, my God.
Oh, my sweet fucking God.

10:37.379 --> 10:39.430
- What?
- Jack.

10:39.465 --> 10:41.349
My egg-waster. Ohh!

10:41.383 --> 10:43.217
- That's the ex dull normal?
- Yeah.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.803
The guy I waited half a fucking decade

10:45.837 --> 10:46.854
to propose to me.

10:46.889 --> 10:48.356
- That guy?
- Yes!

10:48.390 --> 10:51.609
And he dumped me, in a
place just like this...

10:51.643 --> 10:53.344
- fucking Italian food.
- Really?

10:53.362 --> 10:54.529
That is a dick move.

10:54.563 --> 10:56.898
Yeah. And you know what else?

10:56.949 --> 10:59.283
He said it was unethical for him

10:59.318 --> 11:02.236
to keep dating me, knowing
that I wanted to get married

11:02.287 --> 11:03.404
and have kids,

11:03.455 --> 11:04.789
and he wasn't ready for those things.

11:04.823 --> 11:06.357
Well, see, that... that sounds

11:06.375 --> 11:08.692
pretty morally upstanding to me.

11:08.710 --> 11:09.877
- In fact...
- Really?

11:09.912 --> 11:11.329
'Cause it didn't stop him

11:11.363 --> 11:13.581
from having regular sex
with me for five years.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.466
But you could have
gotten rid of him, right?

11:15.501 --> 11:16.801
Wash that man right out of your hair.

11:16.835 --> 11:18.002
Boom! End of problem.

11:18.036 --> 11:19.504
Have you ever thought
about being the dumper

11:19.538 --> 11:21.005
instead of the dumpee?

11:21.039 --> 11:22.423
That's not a bad idea.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.258
- Why don't you practice on me?
- Oh, my God!

11:24.309 --> 11:26.811
Uhh! She has a ring. Look.

11:26.845 --> 11:27.979
Look at her finger.

11:28.013 --> 11:30.181
Do you see that
monstrosity on her finger?

11:30.215 --> 11:32.066
They're fucking engaged!

11:32.100 --> 11:33.267
- I, uh...
- Oh!

11:33.318 --> 11:35.903
Oh, my God, I...

11:35.938 --> 11:37.555
What is my move here?
What do I do?

11:37.573 --> 11:38.940
Nothing. There is no move.

11:38.991 --> 11:40.024
I have to go and say hi?

11:40.058 --> 11:41.526
No! Fuck, no. You don't say hi.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.860
But that's what normal people do.

11:42.894 --> 11:44.895
Jill, you've got to
get out of your own way.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.998
The only thought in your head right now

11:47.032 --> 11:48.166
should be, "fuck that guy."

11:48.200 --> 11:50.201
I'm really starting to think

11:50.235 --> 11:52.253
that's the only piece
of advice you have.

11:52.287 --> 11:55.039
This is what you should do.

11:55.073 --> 11:56.374
What are you doing?

11:56.408 --> 11:58.459
Oh, my God, Moody.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.794
Moody.

12:01.713 --> 12:03.764
Oh, my God, it is you.

12:03.799 --> 12:06.217
Yeah, it's me, buddy.
Kind of busy here.

12:06.251 --> 12:08.553
Well, excuse me for having
the nerve to come up to you

12:08.587 --> 12:09.637
and say hi in public.

12:09.688 --> 12:10.638
Don't blow me off.

12:10.689 --> 12:11.856
I just wanted you to know

12:11.890 --> 12:14.141
that I got the test results back.

12:14.193 --> 12:16.477
And, uh, shit, I hope
you have the courage

12:16.528 --> 12:18.613
to inform the rest of
your sexual partners,

12:18.647 --> 12:20.531
Because lord knows I never had the herp

12:20.566 --> 12:22.450
before you blew me until
I was shooting blood

12:22.484 --> 12:24.285
at the Palm Springs white party.

12:24.319 --> 12:25.486
Whatever.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.955
I hope you and your beard

12:27.990 --> 12:30.124
have a wonderful rest of the day.

12:40.952 --> 12:42.286
- Now...
- Oh, God.

12:42.304 --> 12:44.672
Okay, can I just tell you
that being incredibly sweet

12:44.723 --> 12:46.924
and sensitive to my situation right now

12:46.958 --> 12:49.644
is not making me want
to fuck you any less.

12:49.678 --> 12:52.430
Let's go, baby.

12:52.464 --> 12:54.398
Okay, so here's the thing.

13:00.522 --> 13:02.573
Ugh. He's my life, Charlie.

13:02.608 --> 13:03.991
He's my first client.

13:04.026 --> 13:06.327
I can't lose him. I am
fucked if I lose him.

13:06.361 --> 13:07.945
Let me handle this for you, Sue.

13:11.617 --> 13:14.585
Knock-knock. Runkle calling.

13:14.620 --> 13:17.088
How you doing there?

13:17.122 --> 13:18.205
Hello, hello.

13:18.257 --> 13:20.491
I'm Charlie Runkle and...

13:20.509 --> 13:23.344
Are you the law?

13:23.378 --> 13:25.796
Or are you an outlaw?

13:25.830 --> 13:27.848
'Cause there's only one I can abide.

13:27.883 --> 13:30.351
Sue, uh...

13:30.385 --> 13:31.769
Susan.

13:33.138 --> 13:35.856
No harm, man.

13:35.891 --> 13:38.025
Come in peace.

13:40.112 --> 13:42.113
I owe you an apology.

13:42.147 --> 13:43.347
Don't do this.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.232
Just get your head out of your ass,

13:45.284 --> 13:46.350
and you don't have to apologize.

13:46.368 --> 13:47.851
Come on, Sue,
you know I love you.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.453
Then why change?

13:49.488 --> 13:53.040
It's... it's not about chasing
some shiny Hollywood dream.

13:53.075 --> 13:54.358
Hell, I've...

13:54.376 --> 13:56.210
I've snorted, fucked,
and smoked everything

13:56.244 --> 13:57.795
Hollywood has to offer.

13:57.829 --> 13:59.664
Heh.

13:59.698 --> 14:01.832
It's...

14:01.866 --> 14:04.335
it's about my legacy.

14:04.369 --> 14:08.222
These young bulldogs from UTK
came up nipping at my heels,

14:08.256 --> 14:11.092
Saying they could put my face
on a salad-Dressing bottle

14:11.143 --> 14:13.761
and sell millions for charity...

14:13.812 --> 14:14.895
Paul Newman-type shit.

14:14.930 --> 14:18.048
Shit is exactly what it is.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.684
UTK gives that speech

14:19.718 --> 14:21.819
to every potential client over 50.

14:21.853 --> 14:25.573
It's how they poach boomers...
by preying on idealism.

14:25.607 --> 14:27.525
Who the fuck are you?

14:27.559 --> 14:30.361
I am Charlie Runkle.

14:30.395 --> 14:32.697
You can call me Chuck.

14:32.731 --> 14:34.198
Look, what they want to do

14:34.232 --> 14:36.500
is turn you into a corporate brand, man.

14:36.535 --> 14:37.868
Forget Paul Newman.

14:37.902 --> 14:39.170
Uh, UTK is more likely

14:39.204 --> 14:40.705
to put your name on a McDonald's cup.

14:40.739 --> 14:43.541
Sue here is the one...
stop the vomit.

14:45.761 --> 14:48.078
Listen, Sue.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.748
Did you bring me one
of those mba twerps,

14:50.766 --> 14:52.350
or is this guy a man?

14:52.384 --> 14:54.769
Oh, no. He's a man.

14:54.803 --> 14:56.387
Right.

14:56.421 --> 14:59.056
Well, then let's settle this like men.

15:08.650 --> 15:10.651
You want me to fight you?

15:10.702 --> 15:14.655
You lick me, I go with her.

15:14.706 --> 15:18.125
I lick you,
you will leave the premises.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.828
All right, Runkle.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.446
- I... wha...
- Uhh!

15:22.464 --> 15:24.448
Pound him!

15:24.466 --> 15:26.217
I'm not gonna hit an old man.

15:26.251 --> 15:28.302
I heard that, pantywaist.

15:28.336 --> 15:31.338
Forget to take your
pamprin this morning?

15:34.009 --> 15:35.726
Okay, then.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.898
How do you propose we do this, huh?

15:40.932 --> 15:42.817
We're gonna do it tiger style?

15:42.851 --> 15:44.902
Or do you like the spider, hmm?

15:44.936 --> 15:46.020
Hmm?

15:46.071 --> 15:48.138
Aah! Unh!

15:48.156 --> 15:49.306
Come on.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.242
Sue is Sue!

15:51.276 --> 15:53.411
She believes in people,
not brands.

15:53.445 --> 15:55.329
She had your back when
you were living in her van.

15:55.363 --> 15:57.031
She'll have it till
the day you di... Ow!

15:57.082 --> 15:58.866
That's my fucking bad nipple!

16:00.919 --> 16:03.537
You want your face on
some salad dressing,

16:03.588 --> 16:05.873
sue will get you some
motherfucking salad dressing.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.425
Agh!

16:07.459 --> 16:08.959
Arrgh!

16:08.993 --> 16:11.178
Ohh! God, fuck.

16:11.213 --> 16:13.380
My Goddamn sciatica.

16:13.432 --> 16:15.633
Fuck the whimpering dog pack!

16:15.667 --> 16:18.219
Go with the lioness!

16:18.270 --> 16:19.520
I'm in.

16:19.554 --> 16:23.274
Get the fuck off me.

16:23.308 --> 16:25.142
Runkle.

16:26.561 --> 16:27.862
Come on, you.

16:29.514 --> 16:31.031
Come on.

16:31.066 --> 16:33.734
You almost gave me a
heart attack, you old bear.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.370
Oh, Susie, you know I
never would have left you.

16:36.404 --> 16:40.624
I didn't want to sign
with those UTK guys.

16:40.659 --> 16:42.025
They're the laugh of the town

16:42.043 --> 16:44.712
with that agent that's
masturbating all the time.

16:44.746 --> 16:46.831
Yeah. Tell me about it.

16:46.865 --> 16:49.032
That place is unsavory.

17:10.321 --> 17:11.689
Oh, professor Moody.

17:11.723 --> 17:13.607
- Oh, you shouldn't have.
- Can I come in?

17:13.657 --> 17:16.527
Uh, not the best of times, actually.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.396
Well, I have some
important things to discuss,

17:19.414 --> 17:20.498
weighty things...

17:20.531 --> 17:23.032
stuff I'd like to get off my chest.

17:24.536 --> 17:25.669
Well...

17:25.704 --> 17:26.753
by all means, then.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.791
I really do have a meeting.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.259
Okay, okay.

17:33.795 --> 17:35.846
So look, here's the thing.

17:35.881 --> 17:37.348
No. No, no.

17:37.382 --> 17:39.350
This is yummier.

17:39.384 --> 17:41.602
You're quitting. I know.

17:41.636 --> 17:44.305
You're moving back to
New York, aren't you?

17:44.356 --> 17:46.307
You and kelly are going
to give it another go.

17:46.358 --> 17:47.441
Karen. Karen.

17:47.475 --> 17:48.726
Whatever.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.694
The point is, I assumed
you'd be moving back.

17:50.729 --> 17:52.229
Not to worry, we'll be fine.

17:52.263 --> 17:53.697
Life goes on.

17:53.732 --> 17:55.699
I'm sure I could just
cruise by home depot

17:55.734 --> 17:59.036
and find someone more
suitable for the job.

17:59.070 --> 18:00.404
Hmm.

18:01.573 --> 18:02.873
Well...

18:02.908 --> 18:05.459
You can't say we didn't
give it a shot, right?

18:05.493 --> 18:07.795
We gave it the old
college try, didn't we?

18:07.829 --> 18:09.580
Did you, Hank?

18:09.614 --> 18:10.831
I like to think so.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.167
Oh, well,
that's all that matters, then.

18:13.218 --> 18:15.836
You seem rather annoyed with me.

18:15.887 --> 18:18.672
Ah, it's all for the best, really.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.424
What's for the best?

18:20.458 --> 18:21.759
Well, seeing as though

18:21.793 --> 18:23.477
I made an absolute fool out of myself,

18:23.511 --> 18:26.313
I can't say that I'm
entirely sad to see you go.

18:26.348 --> 18:27.565
No, it's true, really.

18:27.599 --> 18:28.899
You know...

18:28.934 --> 18:31.986
I offered myself to you,
and you weren't interested.

18:32.020 --> 18:33.988
Whoa, Felicia, that's not
exactly how it went down.

18:34.022 --> 18:36.190
Y... you have some
serious relationship issues

18:36.241 --> 18:37.825
to attend to, as do I.

18:37.859 --> 18:39.810
And the most that we could
have offered each other

18:39.828 --> 18:42.580
is some... sexual healing...

18:42.614 --> 18:44.665
pleasures of the flesh
and whatnot, that's all.

18:44.699 --> 18:46.750
Oh, but that's exactly
what I was looking for.

18:46.785 --> 18:48.335
Oh, no, no, no.
You say that, but...

18:48.370 --> 18:49.954
- No, it is.
- No, but... but...

18:49.988 --> 18:52.155
After a while, I would
work my way under your skin

18:52.173 --> 18:54.708
like the slow-moving fungus that I am.

18:54.759 --> 18:57.094
And you... I've always
been a sucker for a woman

18:57.128 --> 19:00.047
who's a boy on my arm
and a puma in the bedroom.

19:00.098 --> 19:03.333
If only I could have just
had one little nibble.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.469
A nibble's not enough. We
both know that, Felicia.

19:05.503 --> 19:06.770
Yeah. It's all for the best.

19:06.805 --> 19:09.506
- So we're cool?
- Yes, we're cool.

19:09.524 --> 19:11.775
Okay.

19:11.810 --> 19:13.310
That's my meeting.

19:13.344 --> 19:15.145
You know what? You can...
you can go out this door

19:15.179 --> 19:16.513
if... if you'd like,
if it's more convenient.

19:16.531 --> 19:18.515
But I... my... my car
is right out front,

19:18.533 --> 19:19.867
- so why don't I just...
- Oh, of course.

19:19.901 --> 19:20.868
I'll see you out.

19:20.902 --> 19:22.369
Oh, oh, wait, wait.

19:23.688 --> 19:25.322
- David.
- Hey.

19:25.356 --> 19:26.323
Ooh.

19:26.357 --> 19:28.125
- Come in.
- You look good.

19:28.159 --> 19:30.494
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
Uh, am I early?

19:30.528 --> 19:31.879
- Am I interrupting something?
- Not at all.

19:31.913 --> 19:33.163
Yeah, well, he kind of is.

19:33.197 --> 19:35.032
Nonsense. Professor
Moody was just leaving.

19:35.050 --> 19:36.700
Hank Moody. David Wilder.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.052
Big fan. Big, big fan.

19:38.086 --> 19:40.704
David's another of our notorious writers

19:40.722 --> 19:42.556
- at the university.
- Yeah, the hardest of woods.

19:42.590 --> 19:43.590
- Yeah.
- I'm aware.

19:43.642 --> 19:44.875
You know,
before you came along,

19:44.893 --> 19:46.677
I was in a fair amount
of trouble with this one

19:46.711 --> 19:48.395
for bedding the local talent.

19:48.430 --> 19:50.397
So thank you for taking
the pressure off me.

19:50.432 --> 19:51.982
Ah, you're welcome...

19:52.017 --> 19:53.767
I guess.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.402
Yeah, it's, uh... it's given me

19:55.437 --> 19:57.187
a hell of a lot of time
to work on my writing,

19:57.221 --> 19:58.605
which is nice, 'cause you
know what I like to do?

19:58.657 --> 19:59.857
I like to sit at my desk,

19:59.891 --> 20:02.860
and I like to brew up
a big mug of word tea.

20:02.894 --> 20:04.361
Word tea? Sure.

20:04.395 --> 20:05.779
You should probably go.

20:05.830 --> 20:06.914
We have work to discuss.

20:06.948 --> 20:08.949
Where... where exactly is, uh,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.918
his royal deanness this evening?

20:10.952 --> 20:12.202
Oh, he's out with friends,

20:12.236 --> 20:15.405
re-creating, uh, the
battle of Chickamauga.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.374
That's interesting.
That's very interesting.

20:17.408 --> 20:19.259
No, it's not, actually.
It's dull as shit.

20:19.294 --> 20:20.594
You're doing it, aren't you?

20:20.628 --> 20:22.913
You're cashing in your freebie,
your marital hall pass.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.431
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:24.466 --> 20:26.100
Yeah, you do. You're gonna
stick it to the deaner

20:26.134 --> 20:28.385
by letting Wilder here show
you his hardest of woods.

20:28.419 --> 20:29.603
I beg your pardon.

20:29.637 --> 20:31.555
Uh, hey, buddy, that is
completely out of line.

20:31.589 --> 20:32.756
Don't... don't do it, Felicia.

20:32.774 --> 20:34.892
Don't throw it all away
for a few clumsy minutes

20:34.926 --> 20:36.226
with the poor man's version of me,

20:36.260 --> 20:37.611
the road-show version of me.

20:37.645 --> 20:39.029
Hey, you know what?

20:39.064 --> 20:41.315
Bragging's not my thing, but
I can go for hours, Moody.

20:41.366 --> 20:42.483
Stay and watch. Be my guest.

20:42.534 --> 20:43.867
Maybe she'll take us both on.

20:43.902 --> 20:45.652
Hank, this is none of your business.

20:45.704 --> 20:48.271
Even if I was cashing
something in or whatever...

20:48.289 --> 20:49.490
Felicia, don't do it.

20:49.541 --> 20:51.241
Don't... don't...
don't chuck it all

20:51.275 --> 20:53.110
for the fucking nutty professor here.

20:53.128 --> 20:54.211
This is bullshit.

20:54.245 --> 20:55.295
You know what?
That is uncalled for.

20:55.330 --> 20:56.780
And we both know that I'm not black.

20:56.798 --> 20:58.999
When was the last time,
by the way,

20:59.050 --> 21:00.617
that you published anything, Moody?

21:00.635 --> 21:01.835
You know what?
Easy for you to say.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.137
No, no, no, no, no,
no. You have no...

21:03.171 --> 21:04.805
You just got back
with your ex-whatever,

21:04.839 --> 21:07.124
just as things were starting
to heat up between us.

21:07.142 --> 21:08.392
You know what, Felicia?

21:08.426 --> 21:09.676
It's up to you.

21:09.728 --> 21:11.461
You know that I would
jump at the opportunity

21:11.479 --> 21:12.679
to make sweet,
hard love to you.

21:12.731 --> 21:14.348
You have the...
you have the ass

21:14.399 --> 21:16.767
of a
ten-year-old boy.

21:16.801 --> 21:18.769
Hank, please, just go.

21:18.803 --> 21:20.404
It's too little, too late.

21:20.438 --> 21:22.439
I can't.

21:22.473 --> 21:25.692
Fine. You're a big girl.

21:25.744 --> 21:27.945
You can make your own decisions.

21:27.979 --> 21:29.747
Be good to her, Wilder.

21:29.781 --> 21:30.981
She's way out of your league.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.533
I concur.

21:32.584 --> 21:33.984
Hey, uh, Moody...

21:34.002 --> 21:36.086
I have a book coming out this spring.

21:36.121 --> 21:39.156
Do you think maybe you
can write me up a blurb?

21:39.174 --> 21:42.159
What's this one called,
the buoyancy of turds?

21:42.177 --> 21:44.595
Think about it. I'll
send you a copy, okay?

21:47.999 --> 21:49.266
I think he's drunk.

22:00.228 --> 22:02.345
So how do you want to do this?

22:02.363 --> 22:04.181
Do you want to just kick back

22:04.199 --> 22:06.066
and start with a little oral, huh?

22:06.117 --> 22:07.651
Do you want a little bit of this?

22:07.685 --> 22:09.369
Or should I go for a little
bit of that, you know?

22:09.404 --> 22:10.988
Because I'll tell you something,

22:11.022 --> 22:13.407
I could eat that peach all night long.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.859
I just camp out...

22:15.877 --> 22:17.294
S'mores.

22:19.330 --> 22:20.547
Yeah, I think you'll find

22:20.582 --> 22:22.466
that I'm a very giving
and caring lover...

22:22.500 --> 22:24.251
so you don't have to worry...

22:24.302 --> 22:27.421
Fine, I'll do it.

22:27.472 --> 22:29.890
You want to throw
your life away, use me.

22:29.924 --> 22:32.476
What? That's the most
ridiculous thing I've...

22:32.510 --> 22:34.211
Please! Go!

22:34.229 --> 22:37.598
Mmm, mmm.

22:39.517 --> 22:42.052
Ohh.

22:42.070 --> 22:45.522
Wilder, go brew yourself
a big mug of word tea...

22:45.556 --> 22:47.608
and dip your balls in it.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.396
Huh.

22:53.414 --> 22:56.083
Behind the green door
is available on Blu-Ray.

22:56.117 --> 22:58.068
Laser disc.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.870
People who sold their laser discs

22:59.904 --> 23:02.072
were absolute assholes,

23:02.090 --> 23:04.407
fools and assholes.

23:04.425 --> 23:06.009
Oh! What?

23:06.044 --> 23:07.044
Flip it.

23:07.078 --> 23:09.847
Ah, flip it!

23:15.086 --> 23:16.419
Wow.

23:16.437 --> 23:18.222
Okay.

23:19.641 --> 23:22.192
So where is the man of
the house this evening?

23:22.227 --> 23:23.977
Berlin.

23:24.028 --> 23:27.364
Think he is bidding on an
Egyptian fertility amulet.

23:27.398 --> 23:29.199
It's quite rare, really.

23:29.234 --> 23:32.202
It's the world's first
depiction of a butt plug.

23:32.237 --> 23:34.154
Excellent. Excellent.

23:34.205 --> 23:36.406
Good for him.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.827
I must toast you.

23:40.879 --> 23:42.546
What you did today was astonishing.

23:42.580 --> 23:43.797
Thank you, Sue.

23:43.831 --> 23:45.799
When you started, I thought,

23:45.833 --> 23:48.418
"My God, this man has
diarrhea of the mouth

23:48.452 --> 23:50.453
and there is no kaopectate in sight."

23:50.471 --> 23:52.956
But the poetry...

23:52.974 --> 23:54.892
that poured out of you...

23:54.926 --> 23:57.794
I mean, you cast your rod,

23:57.812 --> 23:59.846
and you hooked the old swordfish,

23:59.898 --> 24:02.482
and you reeled him in by his taint.

24:02.517 --> 24:04.985
To Charles W. Runkle,

24:05.019 --> 24:06.236
my hero.

24:06.271 --> 24:08.155
No. No.

24:08.189 --> 24:10.490
To you, Sue.

24:17.498 --> 24:19.583
- Ahh.
- Well, look at that.

24:19.617 --> 24:20.834
So let's get this party started!

24:20.868 --> 24:22.152
Hmm.

24:22.170 --> 24:23.486
Toot?

24:24.789 --> 24:26.340
Uh...

24:26.374 --> 24:27.374
why not?

24:29.377 --> 24:31.678
Wow, that's, uh...

24:31.713 --> 24:33.163
that's a nice coke straw.

24:33.181 --> 24:35.498
Very classy.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.434
Yeah. It was given to
me by a female member

24:37.468 --> 24:38.518
of fleetwood mac.

24:38.553 --> 24:40.837
Ahh.

24:40.855 --> 24:42.306
Whew!

24:42.340 --> 24:43.607
Stevie Nicks?

24:43.641 --> 24:45.359
Oh, I can't say.

24:45.393 --> 24:47.277
But it wasn't Christine McVie

24:47.312 --> 24:49.396
or Lindsey Buckingham.

24:49.447 --> 24:51.014
Yeah, Lindsey's a dude.

24:51.032 --> 24:53.233
Exactly.

24:54.902 --> 24:57.404
I have a deviated septum.

24:57.455 --> 24:58.739
Oh...

24:58.790 --> 25:00.240
Well, you really shouldn't
touch this stuff at all.

25:00.291 --> 25:02.743
You know, that really burns.

25:02.794 --> 25:05.128
I want you to do me a solid, Runkle.

25:05.163 --> 25:09.199
I need you to blow this up my bum...

25:09.217 --> 25:12.085
You know, a tush toot.

25:12.136 --> 25:16.974
The old coke in the can, huh?

25:17.008 --> 25:18.258
No biggie.

25:18.309 --> 25:20.844
Ha! Heh, no, it's no biggie...

25:22.313 --> 25:23.597
No biggie at all.

25:30.571 --> 25:32.022
Got anything a little longer?

25:32.056 --> 25:33.690
We'll use this.

25:37.228 --> 25:38.612
Whoa. Not so fast.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.947
Where you going on a
school night, young lady?

25:40.999 --> 25:42.699
Actually, I was hoping

25:42.733 --> 25:44.951
we could go grab some ice cream,

25:45.003 --> 25:47.621
make those coldstone
guys work for their tips.

25:47.672 --> 25:48.672
Really?

25:48.706 --> 25:50.374
What, like me and you?

25:50.408 --> 25:52.409
Together?

25:52.427 --> 25:55.379
Like father and daughter,
almost, together?

25:55.413 --> 25:57.681
To the stone that is cold, together?

25:57.715 --> 26:00.434
That's cool.

26:00.468 --> 26:02.185
What the fuck?

26:06.190 --> 26:08.108
Hank! Mr. Moody.

26:08.142 --> 26:09.192
You're not gonna "Mr. Hank"

26:09.227 --> 26:10.694
your way out of this one, Chelsea.

26:10.728 --> 26:12.946
- Jesus Christ.
- Becca said you'd be gone.

26:12.980 --> 26:15.399
Dad, can you please be cool?

26:15.433 --> 26:17.100
Be cool?

26:17.118 --> 26:18.601
I don't know how much spunk

26:18.619 --> 26:20.370
this kid has deposited
all over your bedroom!

26:20.405 --> 26:23.156
Okay, that was unsavory,
all right?

26:23.207 --> 26:25.992
But it had to be said.
Now, time to go!

26:28.746 --> 26:29.880
Come on, Chelsea.

26:29.914 --> 26:31.715
Ow.

26:31.749 --> 26:32.999
- You limping, Hank?

26:33.051 --> 26:34.584
Yes, I went jogging this
morning, Chelsea, okay?

26:34.618 --> 26:35.836
Now go.

26:35.887 --> 26:37.671
You're not interested in what I'm doing.

26:39.123 --> 26:41.558
Is this really how you want
to spend your school nights?

26:41.592 --> 26:43.844
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

26:43.895 --> 26:45.512
You weren't doing anything wrong?

26:45.563 --> 26:47.464
Becca, you invited your friends over

26:47.482 --> 26:49.733
to fuck in your bedroom
while you waited outside.

26:49.767 --> 26:51.234
That is disgusting.

26:51.269 --> 26:54.187
And that's hilarious,
coming from you and all.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.639
What? I don't understand you.

26:56.657 --> 26:58.358
What the fuck are you thinking?

26:58.409 --> 27:00.577
Do you think this house is a bordello?

27:04.982 --> 27:06.666
Okay, look...

27:06.701 --> 27:08.785
- Here's the thing.
- Actually, dad, yes.

27:08.819 --> 27:10.587
This house is a bordello,

27:10.621 --> 27:12.038
because that's how it's run by you!

27:12.090 --> 27:14.341
Now, don't you try to turn
this around on me. Becca!

27:14.375 --> 27:16.426
Becca! Don't go out that door!

27:16.461 --> 27:19.262
Might as well live
whatever life I have left

27:19.297 --> 27:21.214
before you ship me off to New York!

27:21.265 --> 27:22.599
Becca.

27:22.633 --> 27:23.934
Becca!

27:25.002 --> 27:26.219
Becca.
