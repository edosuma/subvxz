09:51.025 --> 09:52.940
Ooh. Somebody's got
a snake in his boot.

09:52.983 --> 09:56.117
Ooh.
Speaking of snakes,

09:56.160 --> 09:58.119
I gotta drain
the ol' sidewinder.

09:58.162 --> 10:00.861
I call it that because
of how weird it looks.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.123
[laughter]

10:02.166 --> 10:03.341
[whispers] All right,
everyone, listen up.

10:03.385 --> 10:05.605
That man is not
who he claims to be.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.824
That is Benny the Teen.Who?
The mysterious wagon master

10:07.868 --> 10:09.957
who appeared
out of thin air?Yes! Him.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.959
And we have to do something
before he slips away.

10:12.002 --> 10:14.918
Whew! Ahh.
False alarm.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.878
Is it true
what the rev says?

10:17.921 --> 10:19.706
Are you Benny the Teen?

10:22.317 --> 10:23.710
All right, I am.

10:25.712 --> 10:26.974
Ooh...

10:27.017 --> 10:28.976
Benny the Teen!
[laughs]

10:29.019 --> 10:31.239
[laughter]What?

10:32.719 --> 10:34.634
We got a celebrity
in our midst.

10:34.677 --> 10:37.114
He's not a celebrity.
He's a famous murderer.

10:37.158 --> 10:39.247
Please, stay as long
as you need.

10:39.290 --> 10:43.730
It is our honor to be led
by theBenny the Teen.Yeah!

10:43.773 --> 10:45.514
Brethren,
what are we thinking?

10:45.557 --> 10:48.038
We cannot allow ourselves
to be led by this man.

10:48.082 --> 10:50.693
This man's a criminal!
He's done terrible things.

10:50.737 --> 10:51.738
He's done nothing bad to me.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.000
No, not yet.
He just got here.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.305
What if he robs you?
What if he kills you?

10:54.349 --> 10:55.698
Well, that's different.
That'd be a discussion.

10:55.742 --> 10:56.743
Unbelievable.

10:56.786 --> 10:58.570
Well, I guess
it's settled, then.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.921
Now, where was I?
Oh, yes, the husband.

11:00.964 --> 11:03.053
Well, he looks at
us and he says,

11:03.097 --> 11:05.795
"Don't stop. I'm into it.
Keep going."

11:05.839 --> 11:07.536
[laughter]And then I shot him.

11:07.579 --> 11:08.929
[louder laughter]

11:08.972 --> 11:11.671
Sounds like they're
having fun out there.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.455
Well, why don't we have
some fun in here?

11:16.980 --> 11:18.765
I heard what you said earlier

11:18.808 --> 11:21.245
about wanting me
to enjoy myself.

11:21.289 --> 11:24.858
Well, I'm feeling
much better now.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.207
Well, that's nice,
but I--

11:26.250 --> 11:27.643
[shushes]

11:28.818 --> 11:31.647
I want you to
just sit right there

11:31.691 --> 11:35.303
and you let Monsieur Todd
grab the martinis.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.696
[sucks teeth]
I made them extra dirty.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.829
With stagnant pond water
I found beside the road.

11:39.873 --> 11:43.006
[insects buzzing]Oh, I don't think
that's a good idea.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.356
You can catch dysentery
like that.[chuckles]

11:48.403 --> 11:49.491
Ooh, it's spicy.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.450
No, thank you. I can't...

11:52.494 --> 11:54.061
hold my liquor
like you can.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.193
I see.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.542
Straight to business, then.

11:59.544 --> 12:00.241
Okay.Okay.

12:00.284 --> 12:01.764
Are you good?Yeah.

12:01.808 --> 12:04.027
[loud fart]

12:04.071 --> 12:06.073
Did you hear that?
Must've been an owl.

12:06.116 --> 12:08.945
They're
all over these parts.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.642
Anyway, where were we?

12:10.686 --> 12:12.166
[farts] Aah!

12:12.209 --> 12:14.168
They're... [chuckles]
really hooting tonight.

12:14.211 --> 12:16.474
Do you maybe need
to step outside?No, no, no.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.650
I'm good, I'm--hey.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.696
I'm so good.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.219
[wet fart]
Ooh.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.701
Ah. Aah!

12:27.485 --> 12:29.226
[farting continues]Love you.

12:29.270 --> 12:32.012
Oh, Lord! It's like
the great Mississippi

12:32.055 --> 12:35.058
gushing from my ass!
[whimpering]

12:38.758 --> 12:40.977
Hey, kid. Want to come
sit up front with me?

12:41.021 --> 12:43.414
No, thank you. I don't sit
next to evil sinners.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.201
You know, nothing's really
changed, if you think about it.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.377
I'm still taking you
to Oregon.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.727
Might be a nicer trip
if we were more friendly-like.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.382
I'm not your friend.
I thought you were sent by God

12:54.425 --> 12:55.818
but it turns out
you were sent by the devil.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.473
[gunshot]Whoa!

12:58.516 --> 13:00.301
[horses neigh]

13:06.002 --> 13:07.395
Hey, guys!

13:07.438 --> 13:09.049
Oop! Sorry about the gunshot.

13:09.092 --> 13:11.399
I know it's, like,
super loud. [laughs]

13:11.442 --> 13:13.880
Can everyone please
step out of their wagons?

13:13.923 --> 13:15.925
Who is he?Bad news.

13:16.665 --> 13:18.972
MAN IN BLACK:
Yeah, thanks. I'm that guy.

13:19.015 --> 13:21.931
[chuckles] Have any of you
seen Benny the Teen?

13:21.975 --> 13:23.411
With all due respect, sir,

13:23.454 --> 13:25.239
we already got searched
by the sheriff.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.676
Oh, with all due respect,
ma'am,

13:27.719 --> 13:29.678
I ain't the sheriff.

13:29.721 --> 13:30.940
I'm a bounty hunter.

13:30.984 --> 13:34.117
I've brought hundreds of men
to the noose,

13:34.161 --> 13:36.641
but Benny the Teen
has always eluded me.

13:36.685 --> 13:39.906
That is, until I found
a trail of bloody footprints

13:39.949 --> 13:42.647
leading from Fort McAlister

13:42.691 --> 13:45.955
to your town.
[chuckles] Imagine that.

13:45.999 --> 13:49.698
So let me ask you
one more time.

13:49.741 --> 13:54.181
Have any of you seen
Benny the Teen?

13:54.224 --> 13:55.878
[coughs, clears throat]
Benny.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.185
Oh, sorry, I just--
[coughs]

13:58.228 --> 13:59.664
Sorry! [coughs] Benny.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.275
Is it allergies? Uch.

14:01.318 --> 14:04.408
My sinuses go crazy, too.
I feel you, brother.

14:04.452 --> 14:07.672
[coughing] I'm saying
Benny is in there.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.502
Everyone stand back.

14:13.548 --> 14:14.810
I got you.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.725
Congrats! You found me.

14:16.768 --> 14:17.900
But you'll never catch me.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.684
To the trees!

14:21.251 --> 14:22.949
[townspeople gasp]

14:22.992 --> 14:24.907
Guess I'm a little rusty.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.343
Stop playing hard to get.

14:26.387 --> 14:27.692
Thank you, Reverend.
You've done a good deed

14:27.736 --> 14:29.303
bringing this villain
to justice.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.131
Yeah, thanks, Ezekiel.

14:31.174 --> 14:33.133
Good luck getting
to Oregon now.

♪♪♪

14:41.097 --> 14:42.925
No, no, we can still
get to Oregon.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.927
We just follow the trail.

14:45.667 --> 14:49.018
Oh, no.
Where, um... [clears throat]

14:49.062 --> 14:51.368
Where--where is
that trail?

14:57.200 --> 14:58.941
Hey, Zeke.
Doing all right?

14:58.985 --> 15:00.247
Yeah! Yeah, great.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.639
Benny's off to jail
and it's gonna be

15:01.683 --> 15:03.467
smooth sailing
all the way to Oregon.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.121
I am perfectly capable
of leading us.

15:05.165 --> 15:08.472
I just need to figure out
which way is west.

15:08.516 --> 15:09.734
Um...

15:11.562 --> 15:14.000
Huh.
Yeah, this isn't a map.

15:14.043 --> 15:16.785
This is an anatomical
drawing of a horse.

15:16.828 --> 15:19.179
Yes, so it is.

15:19.222 --> 15:21.703
Hmm, there are
its powerful haunches.

15:21.746 --> 15:24.793
Oh, God.
We're screwed, aren't we?

15:24.836 --> 15:25.837
Yeah. [sighs]

15:25.881 --> 15:27.361
It doesn't make any sense!

15:27.404 --> 15:29.885
Why? Why would God send
an evil man to lead us

15:29.929 --> 15:31.234
on a righteous mission?

15:31.278 --> 15:33.367
Why, God, why?
What do you want from me?

15:33.410 --> 15:35.369
Is this some sort of test,
you sick son of a bitch?

15:35.412 --> 15:37.023
Whoa!You want me to crawl
on the ground

15:37.066 --> 15:38.459
and spank my little arse,
do you?

15:38.502 --> 15:40.635

15:49.513 --> 15:51.907
What if God
isn't punishing you?

15:51.951 --> 15:54.214
Maybe God's okay with you
doing a little bad

15:54.257 --> 15:56.520
if it means doing
a lot of good?

15:58.218 --> 16:00.350
You're right.
You're right.

We need to get Benny back.

Yes! Thank you.

Okay, the bounty hunter
probably hasn't gotten far.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.096
We can still catch up.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.228
Prudence? Where are you?

16:08.271 --> 16:09.838
I blasted through
that toilet paper.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.840
We're gonna need
something much stronger.

16:12.754 --> 16:13.973
Do you have to deal
with that?

No. Todd can take care
of himself.

Oh! No, it's fine.

real good and deep

our last chat and all,

I've always been curious--
how come you never

16:35.298 --> 16:36.865
tell anyone your name?

16:36.908 --> 16:40.129
A man needs a name so his people
know what to call him by.

I don't got people.

Ahh.

16:44.220 --> 16:45.569
Nah, I'm not buying it.

16:45.613 --> 16:48.007
I think it's because you have
a really weird name.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.183
Let me guess--
is it Nerbert?

16:50.226 --> 16:51.836
My name's not Nerbert.

Is it Frampton?

with you anymore.

of this historic occasion,

come a little closer.

just look right here.

It's not working!
It's making it tighter.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.569

technically.

give me a break for a second?

My name's not Dingus.

18:55.308 --> 18:58.485
Well, joke's on you,
'cause that horse sucks.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.795
PRUDENCE: Hey, everyone!
We got Benny back!

19:06.841 --> 19:07.798
Hi, guys.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.670
[cheering]

19:14.109 --> 19:15.284
How'd you do it?

19:15.328 --> 19:17.243
It was all Pru's idea.

19:17.286 --> 19:18.287
She tricked
the bounty hunter.

19:18.331 --> 19:19.680
Well, my plan wouldn't
have worked

19:19.723 --> 19:22.161
if Ezekiel hadn't pulled
a friggin' gun on the guy.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.249
Aah, I did do that.

19:23.292 --> 19:24.250
Prudence! There you are!

19:24.293 --> 19:26.774
[all gasp]

19:26.817 --> 19:28.558
Oh, my God, Todd.

19:28.602 --> 19:32.867
Oh, yes. The ivy
made things much worse.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.347
Thankfully, though,
I was able to

19:34.390 --> 19:36.218
fashion this undergarment

19:36.262 --> 19:37.828
out of surplus
wagon materials.

19:37.872 --> 19:40.440
Sort of a gentleman's napkin,
if you will.

19:40.483 --> 19:43.051
Anyway, um, I will need you

19:43.094 --> 19:44.922
to lather aloe
all over my body,

19:44.966 --> 19:48.274
as I am a wee bit concerned
my skin is going to explode.

19:48.317 --> 19:50.276
Of course, dear.

19:52.278 --> 19:55.324
Thanks, Zeke.
That was really fun.

19:55.368 --> 19:57.761
Yeah, it was.
Well, um,

19:57.805 --> 19:59.807
we should do it again
some time.

19:59.850 --> 20:03.463
[laughs]
I'd like that.

20:11.906 --> 20:13.037
I gotta admit,
those were some

20:13.081 --> 20:15.083
pretty impressive
bandit moves back there.

20:15.126 --> 20:16.650
You know, I think you got
a little bit more

20:16.693 --> 20:18.304
bad guy in you
than you think.

20:18.347 --> 20:20.349
Well, I think you have
a little bit more

20:20.393 --> 20:21.437
good guy in you
than you think.

20:21.481 --> 20:22.960
I don't know about that.

20:23.004 --> 20:25.006
No, well, I know you have
killed people,

20:25.049 --> 20:27.051
but I'm sure it was always
in self-defense.

20:27.095 --> 20:30.229
Not really. Sometimes
it was straight-up murder.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.534
Just men, though, right?

20:31.578 --> 20:33.493
Yeah, yeah, just men.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.583
And women.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.368
And some children.

20:39.412 --> 20:40.761
EZEKIEL:
Bad children, at least?

20:40.804 --> 20:43.111
BENNY:
No, just children.
