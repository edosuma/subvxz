WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:03.104
Previously on Scorpion...
We need to bail ourselves out of

00:03.137 --> 00:05.773
a half million-dollar debt. You
put Scorpion up as collateral?

00:05.806 --> 00:06.707
The garage? Everything?

00:06.740 --> 00:09.077
It was either that
or leave you in prison.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.578
SYLVESTER: I know
you-- you're the...

00:10.611 --> 00:13.181
reporter from
the West Altadenia Shopper.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.483
Patty Logan--
here to get your autograph

00:15.516 --> 00:17.518
on this internship release form.

00:18.552 --> 00:19.620
Hey, Patty.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.255
Yep.

00:22.656 --> 00:25.193
Really don't like
this development.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.527
I want to be your attorney.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.529
You want to what?
I care about Cabe,

00:28.562 --> 00:30.164
and I will scour
every lawbook

00:30.198 --> 00:33.101
and memorize every archaic
regulation to protect him.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.235
I can do this.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.504
I'm nervous
to be alone with you.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.172
What could you
possibly be nervous about?

00:38.206 --> 00:39.740
My biggest fear is

00:39.773 --> 00:41.809
being in a restaurant droning
on about genius things

00:41.842 --> 00:45.246
and then looking up at your
face and then seeing boredom.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.656
♪ Are you all alone?

00:55.689 --> 00:58.559
(tapping out of rhythm)

01:02.563 --> 01:05.399
♪ Yeah...

01:05.433 --> 01:08.669
♪ And it's all fine...

01:11.739 --> 01:13.541

01:18.146 --> 01:19.613
♪ Yeah...

01:21.749 --> 01:22.716
Hey. What...?

01:22.750 --> 01:25.586
You're listening to a lecture

01:25.619 --> 01:26.654
while my friend is playing?

01:26.687 --> 01:29.123
♪ Oh...

01:29.157 --> 01:31.592
I think anything but "yes"
would be indefensible.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.427
You can't just drop
the science for an hour

01:33.461 --> 01:34.728
and enjoy the music?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.630
We're going to see
Dr. Smirl speak next week.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.098
I just, I want to be prepared.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.671
Thank you.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.473
That was my latest.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.241
It's called "Sound in Space."

01:48.876 --> 01:50.578
You were amazing.
You sounded beautiful.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.879
I love the new music.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.247
And I love you for coming.

01:53.281 --> 01:55.349
An interesting point of fact

01:55.383 --> 01:56.384
about your last song.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.818
Space is a vacuum,

01:57.851 --> 02:00.154
so there's no sound

02:00.188 --> 02:01.822
in space.

02:01.855 --> 02:04.592
Yes, I did know that.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.894
Oh. And you still
chose that title?

02:08.362 --> 02:09.830
Why don't you go get the car?

02:09.863 --> 02:11.732
Okay.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.834
Oh. Pleasure meeting you, Amy.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.509
So, he's... different.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.778
Little bit.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.915
♪ Mr. Wolfman,
go tell Frankenstein... ♪

02:27.948 --> 02:30.518
Ol' Frankie, break him down.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.820
Only child, terrified of fire,
socially inept.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.688
I'd say he'd make a poor juror
for Cabe's trial.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.457
By those criteria, so would you.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.226
I need concrete basis
for dismissal.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.661
Authorities did chase him
with pitchforks,

02:40.694 --> 02:42.330
so he wouldn't like
law enforcement.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.364
Uh, not a fan of Cabe.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.732
Juror dismissed.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.634
You know, this
song is weird.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.801
Why does the monster in love

02:47.835 --> 02:49.903
ask Mr. Wolfmen to tell
Frankenstein that she likes him?

02:49.937 --> 02:51.372
Why not just tell him herself?

02:51.405 --> 02:53.574
It's not Mr. Wolfmen.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.743
He's a wolfman, you idiot.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.245
It's a Halloween song.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.512
Pretty sure it's Wolfmen.

02:58.546 --> 03:01.215
Yes, that's right.
It's Chuck Wolfmen.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.716
He has a small insurance office
in town

03:02.750 --> 03:04.752
and him and his wife
are on the school board.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.720
He's a wolfman, putz.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.957
Okay, children, I am
going to restart the song

03:09.990 --> 03:11.792
and I'll settle this.

03:11.825 --> 03:15.329
♪ Mr. Wolfman,
go tell Frankenstein... ♪

03:15.363 --> 03:16.964
Oh, wow.
I think she said "Wolfmen."

03:16.997 --> 03:20.000
Ha. What does she know? Let's
get back to jury selection.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.903
You guys prepping already
for jury selection?

03:22.936 --> 03:24.772
Long way to go before the jury
is empaneled.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.874
Pretrial discovery,
potential plea negotiations...

03:26.907 --> 03:29.677
And selection is the one place
I can help Sly hone his skills.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.512
Since it's Halloween,
we figured we'd start with some

03:31.545 --> 03:32.713
familiar faces.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.648
Like this handsome bloodsucker.

03:35.783 --> 03:36.917
What the Hades?!

03:38.486 --> 03:40.488
Ralph, no one wants
to die by pumpkin.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.623
I'm sorry.
Accidental launch.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.926
It's for my science club's party
pumpkin chucking contest.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.028
You know what,

03:48.061 --> 03:49.663
time to take off
the training wheels.

03:49.697 --> 03:52.500
Let's practice
with some actual humans.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.572
Turning the critter
into a cyborg?

03:58.606 --> 04:00.308
It's wearable tech.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.743
Transforms kinetic energy

04:02.776 --> 04:05.012
from body movement
into electrical energy.

04:05.045 --> 04:08.749
Hoping to scale it down
to weave into clothing.

04:08.782 --> 04:09.817
Could generate millions
of kilowatt-hours,

04:09.850 --> 04:12.920
potentially 25% of the energy
people use all year.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.121
You could save the planet.

04:14.154 --> 04:17.558
And be lucrative. Dig Scorpion
out of its financial hole.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.363
Well, is there anything
I can do to help

04:22.396 --> 04:23.597
since I'm the one
that dug the hole?

04:23.631 --> 04:25.933
You're gonna beat this rap,
Cabe,

04:25.966 --> 04:28.569
and then we'll get
our bail money back.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.404
Until then, the only help I need

04:30.438 --> 04:32.706
is from my man,
Ferret B.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.608
It's a little cramped in there.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.679
I'm gonna see if I can get him
a roomier habitat

04:38.712 --> 04:40.848
so the little fella
can stretch his legs.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.717
He's got pretty short legs.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.819
Happy, do you mind if I ask
you a few voir dire questions?

04:45.853 --> 04:46.854
Hoof it, goober.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.056
Now, what did you learn?

04:49.089 --> 04:50.057
Happy is mean.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.959
Can't argue with that.

04:51.992 --> 04:55.062
PAIGE:
Guys, huddle up.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.430
Team, this is Dave Blakely.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.065
I'll let him
explain the job,

04:58.098 --> 05:00.701
whenever Walter sees fit
to join us.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.002
WALTER:
Coming. Proceed.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.771
Okay. Uh, hello, everybody.

05:03.804 --> 05:04.972
I'll be brief.

05:05.005 --> 05:05.773
Right now we have
an opportunity

05:05.806 --> 05:07.841
to prove something
more important

05:07.875 --> 05:09.943
than the proof of dark matter,
faster-than-light travel,

05:09.977 --> 05:11.512
even gene therapy.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.613
Fascinating.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.847
Now, I need your team

05:13.881 --> 05:16.350
to help me prove or disprove

05:16.384 --> 05:18.686
the existence of ghosts.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.688
They don't exist. Disproven.
I will send you our bill.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.089
PAIGE:
Walter.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.858
We need the money. BLAKELY:
And it's good money.

05:24.892 --> 05:25.859
I'm backed by a deep-pocketed
production company.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.128
Production? It's
gonna be filmed?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.063
BLAKELY: Yeah, uh, for the
pilot of a new show called...

05:30.097 --> 05:31.999
you ready?
Ghost Grabbers.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.434
Oh, please.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.903
Well, shooting will
not be obtrusive, okay?

05:35.936 --> 05:38.005
I mean, it's one
camera operated by me

05:38.038 --> 05:39.440
and I'll do all the
B-roll stuff later.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.874
Really, what I need
from your team right now

05:40.908 --> 05:42.976
is to interpret things
like digital thermometers,

05:43.010 --> 05:44.612
infrared cameras, highly
sensitive audio equipment

05:44.645 --> 05:46.380
and maybe some
carbon monoxide detectors.

05:46.414 --> 05:49.550
In case the ghosts
leave their engines running?

05:49.583 --> 05:51.819
No, for when the paranormal
activity begins.

05:51.852 --> 05:52.720
So, never?

05:52.753 --> 05:54.855
Okay, I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.624
See, we have permission
to shoot on the Queen Mary.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.158
Now, the Queen Mary

05:58.191 --> 05:59.860
is one of the most haunted
places in the world,

05:59.893 --> 06:01.562
and over the last three days,

06:01.595 --> 06:03.897
there's been a spike
in paranormal incidents. Okay?

06:03.931 --> 06:05.699
Numerous employees and visitors

06:05.733 --> 06:07.067
have reported feeling
a ghostly presence.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.636
Or reporting
seeing something

06:08.669 --> 06:09.637
you know...
(blows air)

06:09.670 --> 06:10.904
...kind of dart
in the corner of their eye.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.540
It's their sanity departing.

06:12.573 --> 06:13.707
Walter.

06:13.741 --> 06:14.875
No, no, your skepticism

06:14.908 --> 06:16.777
is exactly what I need, okay?

06:16.810 --> 06:18.446
Scientists will
set this show apart.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.848
I want real proof.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.516
Although I should admit that...
(clears throat)

06:22.550 --> 06:25.018
...I am a believer.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.019
You know, there is some
scientific evidence

06:26.053 --> 06:28.055
that leans towards
the existence

06:28.088 --> 06:29.089
of the paranormal.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.491
In 1901, Dr. Duncan
MacDougall

06:30.524 --> 06:32.926
weighed his patients

06:32.960 --> 06:34.027
directly after death
and discovered them

06:34.061 --> 06:36.997
to be 21 grams lighter
than just before they died.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.633
He theorized that
the missing weight

06:39.667 --> 06:41.469
belonged to the human soul.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.904
That study was debunked and
MacDougall's sample was deemed

06:43.937 --> 06:46.006
too small to be
taken as fact.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.475
Also, it was 1901.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.408
We've got the
equipment, Walt.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.878
It's just setting up
and watching monitors.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.013
I don't know about my face
being plastered on TV

06:53.046 --> 06:54.114
pitching hokum.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.783
Exactly what are
the numbers here?

06:55.816 --> 06:56.950
$20,000 for one night.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.986
Okay, well,

06:59.019 --> 07:00.754
looks like we're grabbing
some ghosts.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.158
(horn blows)

07:06.860 --> 07:09.863
Okay. That ought to do it.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.031
Happy?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.101
The angle is good.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.669
WALTER:
Yes, the perfect angle

07:15.703 --> 07:17.538
to catch all apparitions.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.039
Shall we start holding
our breath now?

07:19.072 --> 07:21.008
(exhales)

07:21.041 --> 07:22.976
Breathing exercises?
Calms me.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.479
WALTER: But what is truly
calming is having one's feet up,

07:25.513 --> 07:29.883
fish snack in hand, and enjoying
a quiet moment in the garage.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.985
While your team gets
their hands dirty. Very noble.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.253
Paige, I was clear.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.022
I can't defend my position
as top five

07:35.055 --> 07:35.956
of the world's smartest men

07:35.989 --> 07:38.892
while running around
on TV like Scooby Poo.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.227
Scooby who?

07:40.260 --> 07:41.962
WALTER:
The animated Great Dane

07:41.995 --> 07:42.963
with the speech impediment.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.265
Scooby Doo.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.868
Maybe you could watch an episode
while we work

07:47.901 --> 07:50.604
'cause God forbid you do
anything you don't want to do.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.610
Ruh-roh.

07:56.644 --> 07:57.545
Yup.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.813
Now, make sure to place
multiple sensors

07:59.847 --> 08:01.114
in the hall and engine rooms.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.584
Uh, those have both been
real hot spots lately.

08:03.617 --> 08:06.053
Hot spots for what exactly?

08:06.086 --> 08:08.956
Oh, well, for, uh, Captain
Davenport who died of a stroke,

08:08.989 --> 08:12.025
a first mate who mistook bleach
for rum, and, of course,

08:12.059 --> 08:13.594
Herbie the Halfman.

08:13.627 --> 08:16.029
I saw Herbie Hancock in Tulsa
once.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.866
BLAKELY: Yeah, I'm talking
about Herbert Sternwig.

08:18.899 --> 08:19.867
In 1937, he was betting his crew
how many times

08:19.900 --> 08:21.769
he can cross the threshold
of a hydraulic door

08:21.802 --> 08:23.103
after he hit the close switch.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.005
Well, he slipped
and the door cut him in half

08:25.038 --> 08:26.907
and now he's been roaming
these halls ever since,

08:26.940 --> 08:28.542
(whispering): looking
for his missing lower body.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.644
Okay.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.713
CABE:
Come on, Sly.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.015
Thought you believed
in the soul, not the undead.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.285
I believe
in the scientific possibility

08:38.318 --> 08:40.888
of otherworldly elements.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.089
Happy, how many things
can you name that might

08:42.122 --> 08:44.725
cause one to see an apparition?

08:44.758 --> 08:46.193
HAPPY:
Infrasound,

08:46.226 --> 08:48.762
mold,
electromagnetic fields...

08:48.796 --> 08:51.131
There are psychological
reasons for sightings.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.000
Group suggestibility,

08:53.033 --> 08:55.135
the desire to reconnect
with the deceased...

08:55.168 --> 08:59.339
Granted, but a recent quantum
theory of consciousness

08:59.372 --> 09:01.642
posited that
information exists

09:01.675 --> 09:04.344
in microtubules that exit
the body after they die,

09:04.377 --> 09:06.079
and may be able to exist

09:06.113 --> 09:08.215
without the body indefinitely.

09:08.248 --> 09:12.152
This quantum information could
explain what we call ghosts.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.721
WALTER:
The CERN collider in Geneva

09:13.754 --> 09:15.689
picks up the most
minute bursts of energy

09:15.723 --> 09:18.826
and it has never detected
paranormal energy.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.160
There are no ghosts.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.729
You know, I wouldn't
be too sure, Walter.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.664
My grandfather,
he lived with me

09:23.697 --> 09:26.233
until he died
when I was seven.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.201
We were very close.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.038
His spirit would visit me all
the time as I was growing up.

09:31.071 --> 09:31.972
He looked over me.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.176
It's real and
it's incredibly comforting.

09:36.209 --> 09:40.113
That's actually a very sweet
reason for doing this nonsense.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.649
I can't take you guys anywhere.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.283
Dave, really beautiful story.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.855
What am I looking at?

09:49.356 --> 09:50.758
It's Half-baked Harry.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.025
Herbie the Halfman, but, yes,

09:52.059 --> 09:53.326
we have just seen
our first spirit.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.228
Camera trick. BLAKELY:
No, it's not.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.130
There's no effect in the camera
that could produce a half man.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.037
He's gone!
HAPPY: Whoa.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.138
I just got a chill.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.073
Yeah, my skin's crawling.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.141
What the hell's going on?
I feel it, too.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.343
I feel it, too, guys.
This is exactly what everybody's

10:10.377 --> 10:12.079
been reporting on
the last few days.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.147
No joke, Walt--
I'm feeling that, too.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.248
Yeah, because
you're all succumbing

10:15.282 --> 10:16.850
to the same group hysteria

10:16.884 --> 10:18.151
that you mentioned before,

10:18.185 --> 10:19.019
which is really beneath

10:19.052 --> 10:21.121
the genius contingent
in that room.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.790
It's fine if it's Blakely.

10:22.823 --> 10:23.791
Or Cabe.

10:23.824 --> 10:24.792
Or Paige.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.159
Gee, thanks, Walter.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.295
BLAKELY:
Okay, this sighting may

10:28.328 --> 10:31.098
defy science.

10:31.131 --> 10:31.999
Thoughts?

10:32.032 --> 10:33.834
Well, how about,
"It doesn't"? At all.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.168
The magnetometer readings

10:35.202 --> 10:37.270
are just starting to come in
and it's showing

10:37.304 --> 10:40.173
the entire ship bathed
in an electromagnetic field.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.842
An EMF? From what?

10:41.875 --> 10:44.177
I don't know, but an EMF
can disrupt the electronics.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.212
Like these lights.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.247
And cause skin irritations
and temperature change.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.450
That's why we were all
feeling those chills. Also,

10:50.483 --> 10:53.153
a strong electromagnetic field--
that can cause

10:53.186 --> 10:54.354
mild hallucinations.
It affects

10:54.387 --> 10:56.356
the visual and auditory cortex.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.291
It's kind of what I figured
all along.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.292
Is that why you grabbed my hand?

10:59.326 --> 11:00.894
Like you weren't a little
freaked out, too?

11:00.928 --> 11:02.195
I have
a theory.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.064
What if this EMF
is actually residual energy

11:04.097 --> 11:05.132
from Herbie the Halfman

11:05.165 --> 11:07.768
trying to manifest himself
in our physical plane?

11:07.801 --> 11:09.202
You know what, let's put
this idiocy to bed.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.403
Use the portable EMF readers

11:10.437 --> 11:11.939
to track the source
of the signal.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.206
BLAKELY: Yes, let's do that.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.742
Let's start this inquest
in the most haunted

11:14.775 --> 11:16.443
part of the ship, huh?
The ticket bureau

11:16.476 --> 11:17.444
and the queen's salon.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.212
Yeah, "the most

11:19.246 --> 11:22.482
haunted parts."
It's a good strategy.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.718
(giggles)
Nonsense.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.320
(phone dings)

11:38.498 --> 11:40.700
♪

11:50.077 --> 11:52.079
(detector beeping steadily)

11:56.083 --> 11:58.085
(ship creaking)

12:13.433 --> 12:17.170
I'm not buying this ghost angle,
but this is spooky.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.339
Not that I'm scared.
I'm not, I'm not scared.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.343
Hey...

12:23.376 --> 12:25.412
what do you say
we rig a little watering hole

12:25.445 --> 12:27.214
for ol' Ferret Bueller?

12:27.247 --> 12:29.116
Might be nice
to give the little guy

12:29.149 --> 12:30.550
some sense of the outdoors.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.053
It's an idea.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.359
I lived with Cabe for weeks.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.361
He used a cereal bowl to shave.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.797
But the ferret gets
creature comforts.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.833
It's interesting.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.319
There have been so many
sightings in this room.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.021
Yeah, some people think
that this a vortex

13:08.055 --> 13:09.522
that connects our
world to the next.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.464
(phone ringing) (gasps) Could
you silence that thing?

13:17.497 --> 13:19.299
I'm a little on edge.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.301
(phone beeps)

13:21.334 --> 13:23.036
Walter?

13:23.070 --> 13:24.838
Do you have a moment

13:24.872 --> 13:26.206
for a private conversation?

13:26.239 --> 13:27.474
(grunts)
Hey.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.976
PAIGE:
Uh...

13:29.009 --> 13:31.478
Okay. What's up?

13:31.511 --> 13:33.346
I know why you're angry.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.615
I-I upset you last night
by listening to a lecture

13:35.648 --> 13:37.450
when your friend was playing.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.019
That was wrong.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.956
It felt disrespectful to me.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.224
To her.

13:44.257 --> 13:47.427
Yes. And physiologically, that
caused your adrenaline to spike.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.597
And you're angry now because
adrenaline takes much longer

13:50.630 --> 13:53.833
to drain from women than men.

13:55.435 --> 13:59.039
Uh, okay. Well, I am certainly
spiking right now.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.540
SYLVESTER:
Oh...

14:02.943 --> 14:06.346
Guys, I am getting a
very strong EMF reading.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.448
What does this mean?

14:08.481 --> 14:09.917
WALTER:
Keep moving forward.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.451
You're getting closer
to the source.

14:11.484 --> 14:12.619
Why should I move forward?

14:12.652 --> 14:14.454
Why can't Paige move forward?

14:14.487 --> 14:17.557
Right behind you, you big baby.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.592
(detector beeping steadily)

14:26.666 --> 14:29.136
(beeping rapidly)

14:31.371 --> 14:33.506
PAIGE:
We must be right on top of it.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.008
Or right under it.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.443
Look.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.220
Blood is coming
from the ceiling!

14:47.254 --> 14:48.488
Please.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.622
BLAKELY: No, I can confirm
that something red

14:49.656 --> 14:51.691
is dripping from the ceiling.
SYLVESTER: It's blood.

14:51.724 --> 14:55.595
Blood of a man who was sheared
in half 90 years ago!

14:55.628 --> 14:57.297
Sly, if that's blood,
we're not equipped for this.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.565
We should call someone.

14:58.598 --> 14:59.632
I need to call someone.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.935
Who? Who you gonna call?

15:01.969 --> 15:03.103
Dope. Who do you think
I'm gonna call?

15:03.136 --> 15:04.371
Rhymes with "Toastcrusters."

15:06.239 --> 15:08.141
He fell right into that.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.143
Ow!

15:10.177 --> 15:12.012
Any thoughts on what
we're seeing right now?

15:12.045 --> 15:13.413
WALTER:
Yes. I see the EMF's origin

15:13.446 --> 15:15.582
is on the ship's surveillance.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.284
It's right above you.
I'm calling the ship's

15:17.317 --> 15:18.518
operations department.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.620
Move out.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.524
That doesn't look like
a ghost vortex to me.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.526
I don't even think you can
get cable on that thing.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.261
Pretty hefty antenna.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.631
That doesn't explain the blood.

15:31.664 --> 15:32.966
(horn blowing in distance)

15:35.102 --> 15:37.604
Rust. Exact same color
as the "blood"

15:37.637 --> 15:38.538
on your shirt.

15:38.571 --> 15:39.672
JUSTIN:
Yeah.

15:39.706 --> 15:43.410
There's a cracked water pipe
dripping on the smokestack.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.578
It's been leaking through
the ceiling since this morning.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.714
I'm Justin Fullman.
Ship operations.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.182
You're Herbie the Halfman.

15:50.517 --> 15:53.186
I'm assuming you work near
a surveillance camera,

15:53.220 --> 15:54.454
behind a desk?

15:54.487 --> 15:55.388
Yeah. Why?

15:55.422 --> 15:58.058
Ghost on the monitor
was a double exposure

15:58.091 --> 15:59.492
caused by the EMF.

15:59.526 --> 16:00.660
It merged with
the camera feed

16:00.693 --> 16:03.663
of the state room
with the security feed

16:03.696 --> 16:05.565
from where Fullman was
working behind the desk.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.700
That's why it looked
like he didn't have legs.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.102
How long's that antenna
been up there?

16:09.136 --> 16:10.070
Three days.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.272
Right when the sightings spiked.
I told you.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.341
EMF-induced hallucinations.

16:14.374 --> 16:17.510
Now, wait, wait.
I don't think that this antenna

16:17.544 --> 16:19.079
has the amperage
to do all that.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.580
PAIGE:
Yeah, I'm sorry.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.449
I know you wanted
to believe in those visits

16:22.482 --> 16:23.616
from your grandfather.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.619
No, it's okay.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.056
I wanted it proved
or disproved, so...

16:29.089 --> 16:31.424
Scorpion did its job.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.560
WALTER: Just find out
who set up the antenna,

16:33.593 --> 16:34.661
and then remove it immediately.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.030
Then we can end this charade.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.732
FollowShip's been the leader in
autonomous shipping for years.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.501
We installed that antenna.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.770
WALTER: "Using technology
similar to self-driving cars

16:43.803 --> 16:45.472
"to deliver millions of gallons

16:45.505 --> 16:48.075
of liquid natural gas
without a crew."

16:48.108 --> 16:50.243
That means they make
ghost ships, Sly.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.578
Our vessels navigate

16:51.611 --> 16:54.114
preprogrammed routes,
and they avoid obstacles

16:54.147 --> 16:55.515
thanks to onboard sensors.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.150
Then, within 100 miles,

16:57.184 --> 16:59.152
an antenna
in the destination port

16:59.186 --> 17:00.687
beams directional instructions

17:00.720 --> 17:01.921
to guide them
safely into harbor.

17:01.954 --> 17:04.491
When you leased the antenna
space from the Queen Mary,

17:04.524 --> 17:07.194
did you take into account
its copper degaussing coil?

17:07.227 --> 17:09.396
Uh, no.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.830
Or the copper bed frames
in most of the rooms?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.632
That could cause
interference with the antenna.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.534
And create a very strong EMF.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.402
Copper's a great
conductor.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.637
We really haven't seen
any problems.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.373
Other than three days' worth
of people hallucinating?

17:20.407 --> 17:22.175
Now, have any
of your autonomous ships

17:22.209 --> 17:23.543
utilized the Queen Mary
antenna yet?

17:23.576 --> 17:26.513
Um...
(typing)

17:26.546 --> 17:29.516
The first one passed the
100-mile mark 30 minutes ago.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.517
(typing)

17:30.550 --> 17:32.085
(computer beeping)

17:32.119 --> 17:33.153
Oh, no.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.188
"Oh, no"? Oh, boy.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.689
We've got a ship
that should've turned

17:36.723 --> 17:38.625
toward Long Beach an hour ago.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.593
But it's heading toward Malibu.

17:40.627 --> 17:41.594
You must have a manual override.

17:41.628 --> 17:42.729
Yes.

17:42.762 --> 17:43.796
Um...
(typing)

17:43.830 --> 17:45.398
(computer beeping)

17:45.432 --> 17:46.666
Oh, no.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.435
That's two "Oh, noes."
What's going on?

17:48.468 --> 17:50.103
WALTER: The electrical
interference scrambled

17:50.137 --> 17:51.704
your ship's electronics,
didn't it?

17:51.738 --> 17:53.606
No, uh, th-this has nothing
to do with electronics, okay?

17:53.640 --> 17:55.808
This is an unmanned ghost
ship heading to shore.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.210
Coming to take revenge for us

17:57.244 --> 17:58.578
mocking the spirits
of the Queen Mary.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.880
Oh, will you stop
with that nonsense?

18:00.913 --> 18:02.749
Sydney, the speed and location
of the ship, please?

18:02.782 --> 18:05.352
56 nautical miles
northwest of L.A.,

18:05.385 --> 18:06.819
15 knots.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.655
I'm filming this.

18:08.688 --> 18:09.889
In 40 minutes, that ship
is going to run aground

18:09.922 --> 18:11.258
on the Malibu coast.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.725
How much cargo is it carrying?

18:12.759 --> 18:16.496
SYDNEY: 20 million gallons
of toxic and explosive

18:16.529 --> 18:18.365
liquid natural gas.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.499
CABE: Spill that
size would make

18:19.532 --> 18:22.135
the Exxon Valdez
look like a drop of olive oil.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.477
(boat horn blowing)

18:37.917 --> 18:39.752
I have a visual on the tanker.
I'm into FollowShip's

18:39.786 --> 18:41.888
operating system.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.055
Now, I've done everything
I can think of

18:43.089 --> 18:46.493
to take control of the
ship using the remote override.

18:46.526 --> 18:47.727
There's no way to communicate
with this vessel.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.695
CABE:
All right.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.763
We commandeer a chopper
from the local PD,

18:50.797 --> 18:52.799
land on the ship,
and shut it down.

18:52.832 --> 18:53.933
SYDNEY:
That's impossible.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.268
The control center
is sealed behind

18:55.302 --> 18:57.504
five-inch steel doors.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.172
Anti-piracy measure.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.207
That's three hours of cutting
with a plasma saw.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.242
That's too long. PAIGE:
Then let's yank down

19:02.275 --> 19:03.743
the antenna and move it away
from the copper on the ship.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.912
No, it'll take hours
to recalibrate that antenna.

19:05.945 --> 19:09.216
By then, every grommet at
Surfrider will be hip deep

19:09.249 --> 19:10.383
in Texas tea.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.751
WALTER:
Don't touch the antenna.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.320
If the problem
is the interference

19:13.353 --> 19:14.721
from the Queen Mary's antenna,

19:14.754 --> 19:16.523
then we don't move it,
we boost it.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.258
BLAKELY: I'm sorry.
H-How does increasing

19:18.291 --> 19:19.759
the source of the problem
fix anything?

19:19.792 --> 19:20.760
If we boost
the antenna's signal,

19:20.793 --> 19:22.795
it will cut through
the copper's interference.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.331
Uh, it's like, uh, turning up

19:24.364 --> 19:26.433
a flashlight's brightness
in a fog.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.700
In order to cut through
an EMF that strong,

19:27.734 --> 19:29.902
we need to boost
the antenna's signal by ten.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.838
But where do we get the source
for that much juice

19:31.871 --> 19:33.373
in less than 40 minutes?

19:33.406 --> 19:35.375
Wait. We're standing
on a source.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.509
The engines.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.278
The Queen Mary was one
of the fastest ships

19:38.311 --> 19:39.379
to make the
Atlantic crossing.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.513
She's right. The lower deck

19:40.547 --> 19:41.781
basically houses
a steam power plant.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.583
That hasn't operated
in 50 years.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.784
You think you can
get it running again?

19:44.817 --> 19:46.319
Cabe.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.221
Look who you're talking to.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.656
I can't get it running.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.258
Come on. You were
cocky a minute ago.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.826
That's before I saw
the boiler up close,

19:53.860 --> 19:55.562
and it's ancient history.

19:55.595 --> 19:58.231
Plus, all that's left in there
is a heavy fuel oil,

19:58.265 --> 19:59.732
deep at the bottom of the tank.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.601
Probably nothing but sludge.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.670
Tanker's eight miles
from spilling off the coast.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.005
Are you saying there's no way
to get that engine started?

20:06.038 --> 20:08.241
Well, if the burner lights,
it'll heat the boiler.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.476
That will run
the turbochargers,

20:09.509 --> 20:10.142
then we might have juice.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.744
Lots of variables,
low odds.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.713
L.A. Coast Guard is
on maneuvers in San Diego.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.648
It sent a ship big enough
to intercept the tanker,

20:15.682 --> 20:16.983
but it won't be there
for an hour.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.985
(pressurized hissing)

20:19.018 --> 20:19.952
I'm hearing a hiss
from the gas pipes,

20:19.986 --> 20:21.454
and smelling fuel.

20:21.488 --> 20:22.389
I can't tell
if the concentration's

20:22.422 --> 20:24.391
high enough to ignite--
fingers crossed.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.435
CABE:
Come on.

20:35.468 --> 20:38.805
Guys, I don't know if, uh...

20:38.838 --> 20:40.540
(whooshing)

20:40.573 --> 20:42.642
Whoa.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.644
We got fire!

20:44.677 --> 20:46.579
Blakely, can you
get out of my way?

20:46.613 --> 20:48.448
There's no ghosts here.
You can't prove that.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.750
Let's just these cords connected
and down to Happy.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.655
You sure these extension cords

20:55.688 --> 20:56.923
can carry enough juice?

21:02.962 --> 21:04.531
Heads up, Cabe.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.869
I'm not worried about
the modern extension cords,

21:09.902 --> 21:11.604
it's this outdated flame-broiler
that has me concerned.

21:11.638 --> 21:12.872
But here goes nothing.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.807
(power surging)

21:14.841 --> 21:16.709
We got juice!

21:16.743 --> 21:18.478
Enough to power a small town.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.946
I just have no idea
for how long.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.648
We are literally
running on fumes.

21:21.681 --> 21:24.050
Yeah, it's working-- the
antenna's broadcasting

21:24.083 --> 21:25.452
at over 150 kilovolts.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.986
It's cutting through the EMF.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.555
Have you made contact
with the ship?

21:28.588 --> 21:30.823
Yes. I'm into the ship's
navigation system.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.725
Entering coordinates
for the Port of Long Beach.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.961
Directing the tanker
away from Malibu.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.401
SYDNEY:
It's turning.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.969
Oh, thank God.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.838
(electricity crackling)

21:45.872 --> 21:47.774
Uh, Happy?

21:47.807 --> 21:50.343
So, sparks are flying
from the antenna.

21:50.377 --> 21:52.412
Oh, man, the spirits
are pissed now.

21:54.581 --> 21:55.615
It's a power surge.
It'll cut half the flow.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.084
But if that doesn't do it,
we're kind of screwed.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.754
The antenna's down.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.690
Executing the ship's
emergency cutoff.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.395
It's not responding.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.996
Power surge blew out
communications,

22:10.029 --> 22:11.931
and we're not gonna be able
to guide it into port.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.566
Uh, what's its new
present course?

22:13.600 --> 22:16.503
Southeast by...

22:16.536 --> 22:17.570
Oh, no.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.439
I'm getting real sick
of you saying that, lady.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.440
It's on a collision course

22:20.473 --> 22:22.842
with Vinoly Oil Refinery.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.477
So instead of just
spilling the gas,

22:24.511 --> 22:26.078
it's going to spill
and explode.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.246
SYLVESTER:
Ecological disaster,

22:27.279 --> 22:29.582
poison fumes in the air,
the entire Port of Long Beach

22:29.616 --> 22:31.083
engulfed in flame.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.351
CABE:
It's more than just a port.

22:32.385 --> 22:35.955
Long Beach is also home to half
of California's refineries.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.090
It's built on hundreds
of miles of pipelines.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.460
TOBY: When that tanker hits
the refinery,

22:40.493 --> 22:42.395
it's gonna set off a series
of underground explosions

22:42.429 --> 22:44.431
that'll reach as far as Anaheim.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.399
Be thousands of casualties.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.435
(beeping)
Uh...

22:48.468 --> 22:50.637
so sorry to ask this,

22:50.670 --> 22:52.038
but could you do that
one more time?

22:52.071 --> 22:53.973
I had to change
my memory card.

23:00.179 --> 23:01.147
Okay, we've got
an out-of-control tanker

23:01.180 --> 23:02.281
carrying 20 million gallons
of natural gas,

23:02.314 --> 23:05.151
and in 25 minutes it's gonna
collide with the refinery.

23:05.184 --> 23:06.953
The resulting explosion
will turn Long Beach

23:06.986 --> 23:08.154
into Very Short Beach.

23:08.187 --> 23:09.422
You know, for the record,
I liked it better

23:09.456 --> 23:11.157
when we were busting ghosts.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.059
Yeah, well, trust
me, you still are.

23:13.092 --> 23:13.960
What about the navy?

23:13.993 --> 23:16.829
There's vessels
in the Gulf of Mexico

23:16.863 --> 23:17.864
participating in war games.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.131
They've been dispatched,

23:19.165 --> 23:20.633
but they won't make it
back in time.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.001
I don't want to be that person,

23:22.034 --> 23:24.103
but I think you need to start
evacuating people.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.638
I already told you
the web of pipelines

23:25.672 --> 23:27.540
go inland for dozens
of miles.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.642
There's no outrunning
the explosion.

23:29.676 --> 23:31.478
Our only solution is
to stop the tanker.

23:31.511 --> 23:32.512
SYLVESTER:
That makes sense

23:32.545 --> 23:34.881
in theory,
but we need to strike it

23:34.914 --> 23:36.215
with something with great force.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.750
So we need something
very heavy

23:37.784 --> 23:39.552
and very fast.
There's not a vessel

23:39.586 --> 23:41.888
in that port that can reach
that kind of acceleration.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.189
Wait, wait,
what about the pipeline?

23:43.222 --> 23:44.824
It's pressurized to move
dense fuel at high speeds.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.693
Couldn't we use it
to launch something

23:46.726 --> 23:48.995
very heavy and very fast?

23:51.631 --> 23:53.099
Why do you guys always
look so surprised

23:53.132 --> 23:54.501
when I know something?

23:54.534 --> 23:55.835
HAPPY:
She's right.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.804
We can basically
turn the pipeline

23:57.837 --> 23:59.138
into Ralph's pumpkin chucker,

23:59.171 --> 24:00.707
and slam the section
of the ship

24:00.740 --> 24:02.008
that doesn't carry
any cargo.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.042
WALTER:
Well, that would work,

24:03.075 --> 24:04.911
especially if the ship's course

24:04.944 --> 24:06.946
will take it over the pipeline's
ocean-side opening.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.915
Now, we're gonna need
three things to pull it off.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.684
Gumption, spunk, and a little
thing I like to call moxie.

24:11.718 --> 24:12.819
Shut up.

24:12.852 --> 24:15.121
First, we have to reverse
the flow of the pipeline.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.856
Currently, it's set
to bring crude

24:16.889 --> 24:19.025
from ships to the refinery--
we need to flip that.

24:19.058 --> 24:22.228
We'll also need to create
a projectile

24:22.261 --> 24:24.897
heavy enough to travel
through the refinery pipeline

24:24.931 --> 24:27.500
and pierce the opening
where the ships hook into it.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.035
I'll get a metal barrel
from the engine room.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.169
I'll contact the refinery.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.704
WALTER:
Sly, calculate

24:31.738 --> 24:32.772
the precise moment
to launch the projectile

24:32.805 --> 24:35.174
so it hits the tanker
in a spot that will sink it,

24:35.207 --> 24:37.810
but not puncture its tanks
and set off an explosion.

24:37.844 --> 24:38.678
Aye, aye.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.720
(tires screeching)

24:49.789 --> 24:50.823
You with Scorpion?

24:50.857 --> 24:53.560
Yeah. Head office filled
us in-- right this way.

24:54.561 --> 24:55.995
(tires screeching)

24:56.028 --> 24:57.530
WALTER:
Hey!

24:57.564 --> 24:58.598
I'm here to help.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.066
Better late than never.
Come on.

25:03.903 --> 25:06.773
So how do we turn this barrel
into a boat buster?

25:06.806 --> 25:09.008
We need to increase
its mass.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.543
CABE:
Sandbags.

25:21.754 --> 25:24.223
What the hell did that
thing ever do to you?

25:24.256 --> 25:27.594
It needs to be conical to work.

25:27.627 --> 25:30.897
You think you can do that
to Ferret Bueller's new cage?

25:30.930 --> 25:32.999
Maybe put a mesh window in there

25:33.032 --> 25:34.934
so he doesn't have to look
through the bars all day?

25:37.303 --> 25:39.205
Pipeline hasn't had
a delivery in a day,

25:39.238 --> 25:40.973
so it's empty from here
to the ocean.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.342
Excellent. Shutting
the safety valve now.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.111
(buzzer blaring)
I'll go turn the water on.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.946
Run this down for me
one more time.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.015
I shut off the safety valve
to build up the pressure

25:49.048 --> 25:50.950
in the pipeline from
here to the ocean.

25:50.983 --> 25:52.685
Now, filling it with water...

25:52.719 --> 25:55.287
(water rushing)

25:55.321 --> 25:58.124
...turns the pipe
into a hydraulic cannon

25:58.157 --> 25:59.125
that can launch the metal drum

25:59.158 --> 26:00.693
Happy and Cabe
are preparing.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.695
And that great
idea was Paige's.

26:02.729 --> 26:05.297
I'll monitor the hose's
water pressure.

26:05.331 --> 26:07.867
How do you know about
pipeline physics, anyway?

26:07.900 --> 26:08.868
Flow dynamics.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.036
Dr. Smirl's lecture.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.037
Yeah, the one
you were listening to

26:11.070 --> 26:11.971
at my friend's show.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.973
Oh, well, that lecture
is dense material.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.307
It's like listening to Chinese,

26:15.341 --> 26:16.843
but you want
to go see him speak,

26:16.876 --> 26:18.077
so I'm trying
to understand some of it.

26:18.110 --> 26:21.881
That's very...
considerate of you.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.716
Well, that's what people
in relationships do.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.952
They try to take interest
in one another's hobbies,

26:25.985 --> 26:28.020
even it it takes
a little bit of effort.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.155
(wheels squeaking)

26:29.188 --> 26:31.090
CABE (grunts):
One barrel,

26:31.123 --> 26:33.059
set for blastoff.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.094
Okay, Toby, we're
good to go here.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.796
TOBY: Good, 'cause we're
running low on time.

26:36.829 --> 26:39.031
The ghost ship is 30 minutes
from barbecuing Long Beach.

26:39.065 --> 26:41.100
Okay. Sly?

26:41.133 --> 26:45.004
Sydney gave me wind speed,
port depth and acceleration.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.206
Still hasn't passed
the horizon yet,

26:47.239 --> 26:49.676
so I'm going to plug all of that
into my calculations.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.844
Do you mind?
I'm working.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.012
Yeah, so am I.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.014
Hey, man, I thought
you were on my side.

26:55.047 --> 26:58.084
No, I said that there was
a slight scientific possibility

26:58.117 --> 27:00.720
of a netherworld
or something like it.

27:00.753 --> 27:01.888
We've explained
everything else away.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.258
Okay, look, I know you think

27:06.292 --> 27:08.260
ghosts are real, or
believing in ghosts

27:08.294 --> 27:11.297
helps you, but you're
getting in my way

27:11.330 --> 27:13.165
of saving lives.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.901
Actual living people.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.136
Done.

27:17.169 --> 27:20.139
Okay, you guys need to launch
the barrel on my count.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.674
Five...

27:21.708 --> 27:23.375
four...
Barrel's in.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.144
three...

27:25.177 --> 27:26.378
two...

27:26.412 --> 27:28.715
one...
No, stop.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.783
Huh? No?
Don't fire the barrel?

27:30.817 --> 27:32.318
SYLVESTER:
Uh, no. I mean, yes!

27:32.351 --> 27:33.452
Launch the barrel now.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.954
Now!

27:44.997 --> 27:46.398
Okay, looks like the tanker
got rocked a bit.

27:48.868 --> 27:51.003
Come on, Sly, tell us
what we want to hear.

27:51.037 --> 27:53.039
Well, the barrel was
launched late,

27:53.072 --> 27:56.108
thanks to someone's
reflector.

27:56.142 --> 27:59.178
But I saw the tanker
list heavily.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.412
Impact might have been enough

28:00.446 --> 28:03.215
to open up a non-cargo
section of the ship.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.450
Could be filling
with water as we speak.

28:04.483 --> 28:06.118
TOBY:
No, it's not.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.187
Must have hit it too far back
in the stern.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.422
That ship is still
heading for Long Beach,

28:10.456 --> 28:12.024
and it is gonna collide
with the refinery

28:12.058 --> 28:14.026
in less than half an hour.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.466
That boat is still headed in.
It's strong and steady.

28:20.499 --> 28:21.433
This is bad.

28:21.467 --> 28:22.601
SYDNEY: Maybe not as strong
as you think.

28:22.634 --> 28:25.838
My readings show that the impact
caused an electric surge

28:25.872 --> 28:28.007
that shorted the locks
on the security doors.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.341
That means its shields are down!

28:29.375 --> 28:31.077
Did you guys hear that?

28:31.110 --> 28:32.178
If we can get on the ship,

28:32.211 --> 28:34.013
we can hardwire
into its system

28:34.046 --> 28:35.882
and then execute
its emergency cutoff.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.016
All right, headed
to the marina now.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.152
But we're gonna need a hell
of a ride when we get there.

28:40.186 --> 28:43.155
Sly, you heard the man.
G-Get a fast boat, fast.

28:49.128 --> 28:52.031
Okay, who out here is gonna
let me borrow their boat?

28:52.064 --> 28:53.365
TOBY (over comm): Use your
jury-selection training.

28:53.399 --> 28:54.767
Trust your instincts.

28:54.801 --> 28:58.504
Okay, profiling.
Profiling.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.041
No, woman will protect her child

29:02.074 --> 29:03.409
and be suspicious
when I approach.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.946
A jogger's just out here
getting his exercise.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.347
Most likely doesn't own
a boat in the marina.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.049
Sly, speed round!

29:10.082 --> 29:12.118
Oh, I think I found our ticket.

29:12.151 --> 29:15.221
Male, early 40s, red shorts,
gray socks, ponytail.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.455
That is all inconsequential.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.257
And a Super Fun Guy backpack!

29:18.290 --> 29:19.792
The dork's your guy.

29:22.161 --> 29:23.930
There she is.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.902
Guys, tanker's still
at 15 knots.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.203
Cabe, boarding is
gonna be safest

29:31.237 --> 29:33.072
if you can match its speed
as close as possible.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.073
How close are they?

29:34.106 --> 29:37.276
They're coming around
portside as we speak.

29:39.946 --> 29:41.313
Get ready, son!

29:43.582 --> 29:45.517
Coming up on 15 knots!

29:45.551 --> 29:47.219
Okay, based on my weight

29:47.253 --> 29:48.921
and approximate distance
to the ship,

29:48.955 --> 29:50.489
I should jump at exactly...
No time for math!

29:51.290 --> 29:52.491
(screams)

29:54.526 --> 29:56.829
He made it! He's on the tanker!

30:02.268 --> 30:04.503
CABE:
Heading back now!

30:06.238 --> 30:08.074
Oh, this may be an issue.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.946
The cabin door's moving so fast
it's become a guillotine.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.248
Sounds like that electric surge
didn't just unlock the cabin,

30:16.282 --> 30:17.416
it shorted out the door.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.852
Mm, what if it's Herbie the
Halfman possessing the ship?

30:19.886 --> 30:20.920
Oh, shut it.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.221
Walt, either way,
you got to get through that door

30:22.254 --> 30:23.389
if we're gonna stop that tanker.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.291
Can you see a pattern
to the door?

30:25.324 --> 30:27.293
It's opening and closing
incredibly fast.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.060
That's the pattern.

30:28.094 --> 30:30.229
Shh. Everyone,
quiet for a second.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.464
(door thudding over comm)

30:32.498 --> 30:34.400
Walt, it's moving at 3/4 time.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.368
One upbeat, two down.
If you go on the upbeat,

30:36.402 --> 30:37.870
you'll get past the door.

30:37.904 --> 30:40.139
I can't hear the pattern.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.308
Well, just pretend it's music.
There's math in music.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.277
Just close your eyes and listen.

30:48.547 --> 30:52.018
(door continues thudding)

30:52.051 --> 30:53.319
I can hear it.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.154
Now, just wait for the upbeat.

30:56.622 --> 30:57.990
Now!

30:58.290 --> 30:59.892
Did you make it?

31:02.261 --> 31:04.063
Barely.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.365
Now I'm Walter the Halfshirt.

31:08.634 --> 31:09.435
(computer beeps)

31:09.468 --> 31:12.338
Okay, Toby,
you are hardwired in.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.439
Hang on tight.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.407
I'm executing
the emergency stop...

31:15.441 --> 31:17.143
now.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.377
(sonar pinging)

31:18.410 --> 31:21.347
It's not slowing down.

31:23.349 --> 31:24.316
Yeah, so that should've worked.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.651
Oh, the electric surge

31:25.684 --> 31:28.187
must've fried the ship's
internal controls.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.655
TOBY: The only thing
I can bring on line now

31:29.688 --> 31:31.490
is the ship's sonar,

31:31.523 --> 31:33.159
and even that's not
registering solid objects,

31:33.192 --> 31:35.361
just a narrow band
of frequencies.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.695
So she's swimming blind?

31:36.728 --> 31:38.464
We can use that.

31:38.497 --> 31:40.699
I-It's like when I closed
my eyes to get past the door.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.601
I couldn't see the pattern,
but I could hear it.

31:42.634 --> 31:45.271
We can solve
this problem with music, also.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.439
Not the time for a music
appreciation course, Walt.

31:47.473 --> 31:50.076
Just hear me out.
When musicians record songs,

31:50.109 --> 31:52.945
they're essentially plugging
holes in the sonic spectrum.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.014
So if we use the industrial
speakers on the deck

31:55.047 --> 31:56.315
to blast a song at the tanker

31:56.348 --> 31:58.084
at a high
enough volume,

31:58.117 --> 31:59.952
we should be able to create
a sonic wall large enough

31:59.986 --> 32:03.122
to trick the sonar into thinking
it's approaching an actual wall.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.590
At which point the ship
should stop itself,

32:04.623 --> 32:06.558
and that'll prevent it
from running into the refinery

32:06.592 --> 32:08.394
and save us all from
a deadly case of heat stroke.

32:08.427 --> 32:11.363
I got music on my phone.

32:11.397 --> 32:13.732
If this plan is gonna work,
we're gonna have to position

32:13.765 --> 32:17.036
all the speakers
on this old boat toward the sea.

32:25.144 --> 32:26.945
So don't go home. And you
call me when you get this.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.615
Sorry. Know I wasn't
supposed to tell anyone.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.050
But I just left my mom
a message.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.018
She lives right near
the refinery.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.485
You want to save lives?
Get music blasting

32:33.519 --> 32:34.553
on every speaker on the deck.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.355
Plugging it into
the emergency broadcast system.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.227

it was science
that saved the day.

go to a Halloween party

36:11.337 --> 36:13.572
Well, he seems happy.

36:13.605 --> 36:16.542
But I still think we can
brighten it up a little bit.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.944
You know, in three years, you
haven't so much as acknowledged

36:18.977 --> 36:21.580
that polecat,
and now you're his decorator.

36:21.613 --> 36:22.881
Little interesting.

36:22.914 --> 36:26.418
It's clear you're going
through something, Cabe.

36:26.452 --> 36:28.587
Something that doesn't
make you comfortable

36:28.620 --> 36:31.590
with things
being caged up.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.892
Just a flyer
here, but...

36:33.925 --> 36:37.696
that might have something to do
with your criminal charges.

36:37.729 --> 36:39.731
(Ferret Bueller chittering)

36:41.600 --> 36:45.304
It's not gonna make you weak
to talk about it.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.339
Hard pass.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.677
I know you don't like
discussing your feelings,

36:51.710 --> 36:54.513
but I always thought you
respected me,

36:54.546 --> 36:55.981
what I dedicated my life to.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.517
Being a smartass?

36:58.550 --> 37:01.019
I'm just asking
for five minutes.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.755
(chime jingling)

37:07.693 --> 37:08.994
Five minutes.

37:09.027 --> 37:11.229
That's it.

37:15.301 --> 37:17.769
(horn honking in distance)

37:20.639 --> 37:21.773
Ladies' choice.

37:23.809 --> 37:26.378
Uh-huh. The roll.

37:26.412 --> 37:27.746
Yes. Good choice.

37:27.779 --> 37:30.316
I will be the rock,
and together, we will be...

37:30.349 --> 37:31.750
Walter, I-I get it.

37:31.783 --> 37:32.918
We should go.

37:32.951 --> 37:35.954
So, you read, uh, Flow Dynamics.

37:35.987 --> 37:38.757
Taking an interest
in one of my hobbies,

37:38.790 --> 37:40.759
so I took an interest
in one of yours.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.694
I downloaded
your friend's album.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.530
We can listen to it
on the way to the party.

37:44.563 --> 37:46.598
Well, that's nice,
but I don't...

37:46.632 --> 37:48.467
I don't want to force you
to do that.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.302
You're not forcing anyone, no.

37:50.336 --> 37:52.938
Although I will need help
understanding it,

37:52.971 --> 37:55.474
as there's no sound in space.

37:55.507 --> 37:56.542
It's a metaphor,

37:56.575 --> 37:58.710
describing the trouble
she has expressing herself

37:58.744 --> 38:00.579
for someone she loves.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.348
Music is...

38:02.381 --> 38:03.782
how she conveys her feelings.

38:03.815 --> 38:04.950
So you like it

38:04.983 --> 38:07.653
when people communicate
their emotions through music?

38:07.686 --> 38:10.622
It's like the
electromagnetic field today.

38:10.656 --> 38:13.859
We couldn't see it,
but it affected us.

38:13.892 --> 38:17.396
I don't know, there's something
kind of special about a power

38:17.429 --> 38:19.631
that you can't see
but you can feel.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.633
Music's like that.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.402
It can be an
unadulterated

38:23.435 --> 38:25.671
expression of truth.

38:27.639 --> 38:31.577
And that's why I wish you'd
just given it a chance, Walter.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.648
Okay. We have to go
pick up the pizza

38:36.682 --> 38:38.717
for the party.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.820
You know, uh,
I'll meet you in the car.

38:41.853 --> 38:43.489
I just need to
send an e-mail.

38:44.856 --> 38:46.525
Okay.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.560
Okay.

38:53.732 --> 38:56.101
(door closes)

38:56.134 --> 38:58.336
(typing)

39:07.446 --> 39:11.383
(door opens and closes)

39:11.417 --> 39:13.552
TOBY:
All right.

39:13.585 --> 39:15.654
Step into my office.

39:15.687 --> 39:16.121
(door creaks)

39:16.154 --> 39:18.390
The trailer.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.861
Would have expected more
from a Harvard man.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.132
You sit down and get relaxed,

39:27.165 --> 39:30.135
and we'll talk.

39:30.168 --> 39:32.838
Here comes the New Age
mumbo jumbo.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.406
I got no
mumbo jumbo.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.907
I'm just
gonna listen.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.543
About you

39:37.576 --> 39:39.110
and your mindset
with the upcoming trial.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.812
How you feel.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.881
Whatever you want to say.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.420
(chime jingling)

39:52.223 --> 39:54.192
Doc, I'm worried.
