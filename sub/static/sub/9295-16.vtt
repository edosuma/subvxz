Previously on 24.

about Τaylor's response
to the ultimatum.

Put your gun down.

- Mr. President-

00:23.357 --> 00:26.818

I couldn't live with that.

up the bomb anyway?

00:28.904 --> 00:31.656

to stop the attack.

than five minutes.
We gotta move.

Ηassan to another vehicle

02:06.460 --> 02:08.377
lt's a new protocol
because of the E.M.P. attack.

Nobody gets in or out

by Mr. Hastings.

You'll have to talk

It'll just be a couple of minutes.

Yep.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.149
Only one car left

03:12.234 --> 03:15.486
one minute
after the crash-
northeast exit.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.697
A blonde woman was driving.
Hassan was probably in it.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.366
- Can you track it?
- No. It left the satellite grid.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.410

Great. Τhank you.
Madam President,
Brian Hastings.

03:31.628 --> 03:35.089
Mr. Hastings, l saw the crash.
Please tell me
President Hassan survived.

03:35.173 --> 03:38.759
Actually, we just learned
that President Ηassan
was not in the vehicle.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.761
l don't understand.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.930
During the pursuit,
we believe he was
switched to another car.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.224
We're trying
to track it now.
Then he's still alive.

03:45.309 --> 03:46.809
lt appears so, ma'am.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.061
lf the terrorists wanted
him dead, they would have
killed him on sight.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.147
They must have
another agenda.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.482
l don't even
want to speculate
on what that might be.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.568
We will keep you apprised,
Madam President.

Is my father alive?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.663
We think so.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.958
But he's still in the hands
of the terrorists.

04:11.043 --> 04:13.461
Now, C.Τ.U. is
searching for him now.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.546
Then there's still hope?
Yes.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.882
Excuse me. But, Madam President,
the Russian Foreign Minister
is outside.

04:19.009 --> 04:23.012
He wants to speak
with you.
I'll be right there.

04:24.598 --> 04:28.476

how hard this is
for both of you.

04:28.560 --> 04:33.189
Please know that I'm committing
every resource at my disposal
to finding him.

what can I do for you?

04:47.162 --> 04:50.790

Can l assume
there is no change...

04:56.463 --> 04:58.381
in the status
of President Hassan?

04:58.507 --> 05:02.218
l'm afraid not.
Then he is still
being held by terrorists.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.178
For now, yes.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.973
Are you hopeful
that C.T.U. can recover him?

05:07.057 --> 05:11.143
We're following a lead now.
And, yes, we are very hopeful.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.104
What is the nature of the lead?

05:13.188 --> 05:15.940
l'd rather not get into specifics.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.526
You'll be told
the second we know more.

05:18.610 --> 05:22.947
Oh. Madam President,
l need to stress
that if Hassan is not found,

05:23.031 --> 05:24.991
his government
will be in disarray.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.410
Τhe peace agreement
will have no chance of success.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.495
l'm aware of that,

05:29.579 --> 05:33.332
but there's-
there's no point in speculating
on the worst-case scenario.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.377
We're not there yet.
l just want to make
our position clear.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.963
lf Ηassan dies,
there is no agreement.

05:41.258 --> 05:45.469
lf I didn't know better,
l'd think you were hoping
for that to happen.

05:45.595 --> 05:49.432
Madam President-
You believe this treaty weakens
your influence in the region.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.059
Your country has been looking
for any excuse to pull out.

05:52.144 --> 05:54.395
l realize you are under
a great deal of pressure,

05:54.479 --> 05:57.398
but there is no reason
for these baseless accusations.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.067
My country has been
more than supportive.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.446
We are here, are we not?

06:06.575 --> 06:08.534
Perhaps l spoke too harshly.

how perilous this situation is.

06:13.582 --> 06:16.417

your support,

that I can count on it...

for a second?

06:40.609 --> 06:42.318

Jack thinks that someone
inside of C.Τ.U. is working
for the terrorists.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.657
Why does he think that?
They must have been warned
that they were being followed.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.701
Τhat's why they
transferred Hassan
to a different car.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.912

The glitch that allowed
the terrorists to get away.

especially for us.

to tip him off, we can get
the number off the memory.
