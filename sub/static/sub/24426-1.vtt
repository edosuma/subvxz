33:30.318 --> 33:34.322
I don'’t know.
I just think...it'’s weird.

33:34.357 --> 33:38.568
Our job is weird,
but it'’s also boring.

33:38.602 --> 33:41.364
I'’m...sorry if your husband
is boring you too,

33:41.398 --> 33:44.125
but that doesn'’t give you an
excuse to go rogue at work.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.404
You could get in a lot of
trouble if I was a serious man.

33:47.439 --> 33:49.337
Trouble'’s not interested in me.

33:49.372 --> 33:52.961
Go to the hospital, make sure
your witness is cozy and safe,

33:52.996 --> 33:56.241
then go home
and don'’t do anything weird.

33:57.104 --> 33:59.209
[Distant sirens]

34:03.144 --> 34:05.215
It'’s only two or three
questions.

34:05.250 --> 34:08.701
Just say you'’re her cousin.

34:08.736 --> 34:12.602
I'’m with the security team
monitoring Kasia Molkovska.

34:12.636 --> 34:15.467
Last on the left.
Ask for Nurse Watkins.

34:15.501 --> 34:18.159
You can'’t miss her.
She'’s in the fun scrubs.

34:21.921 --> 34:23.509
Eve Polastri.

34:25.615 --> 34:27.306
Hi. Is Kasia awake?

34:27.341 --> 34:30.102
- She'’s not fit for interview.
- Oh, no. I know.

34:30.137 --> 34:31.897
This is a relative of Kasia'’s.

34:31.931 --> 34:33.864
He just wanted to
say hi quickly.

34:33.899 --> 34:35.935
Oh, lovely.
Okay, uh, just take a seat.

34:35.970 --> 34:37.523
I'’ll let you know
when she'’s ready.

34:37.558 --> 34:39.077
Great. Thank you.

34:43.633 --> 34:45.566
Is this legal?

34:45.600 --> 34:48.603
It'’s fine. Wait here a sec. I'm
just gonna pop to the loo.

34:50.467 --> 34:53.332
We should have brought her
some chocolate or something.

34:56.128 --> 34:58.061
I'’ll see what I can find.

[Toilet flushes]

35:32.889 --> 35:34.718
Are you alright?

35:47.145 --> 35:48.456
Wear it down.

[Cellphone rings]

36:07.510 --> 36:09.615
- Hi.
[Bill] Where are you?

36:09.650 --> 36:13.067
- On the loo.
- There was no CCTV.

36:13.101 --> 36:14.172
What?

36:14.206 --> 36:16.553
It'’s annoying me,
but you were right.

36:18.866 --> 36:20.971
We'’ve been bullshat.

36:21.006 --> 36:23.111
Keep that girl safe.

Oh, God, God, Kasia! Oh,
my God! Oh, Kasia. Oh, Kasia.

Please. Please, stay with me.

Oh! Somebody help me!

37:27.279 --> 37:28.591
Oh!

37:41.673 --> 37:44.607
If they fire you, you'’d better
drag me down with you.

37:44.641 --> 37:46.643
- No, you'’re not doing that.
- I am.

37:46.678 --> 37:48.266
I'’ve been looking for an excuse

37:48.300 --> 37:50.613
to call Frank a dick-swab
for years.

37:50.647 --> 37:52.753
I'’m the dick-swab.

37:53.926 --> 37:56.032
I should have requested
more security.

37:56.066 --> 37:59.794
You had two armed officers.
You did the right thing.

38:04.109 --> 38:06.767
You'’re brilliant.

38:06.801 --> 38:08.631
Just don'’t tell them
everything.

38:08.665 --> 38:10.288
You'’ll sound like a nutter.

38:12.428 --> 38:13.843
[Door opens]

38:13.877 --> 38:18.296
Right. The boy'’s parents
are here.

38:18.330 --> 38:20.884
Apparently, they thought he was
playing bridge.

38:25.820 --> 38:27.477
Have you made your statement?

38:30.169 --> 38:33.311
Well...that one could have
gone better.

38:35.796 --> 38:37.832
I don'’t want to say
you only had one job--

38:37.867 --> 38:39.627
Oh, piss off, Frank.

38:42.941 --> 38:46.979
I don'’t think you should speak
to me like that right now, Eve.

38:47.014 --> 38:49.982
[Sniffs] Can you...can you just
tell me what I need to do?

38:54.746 --> 38:56.851
From what I'’ve managed
to gather,

38:56.886 --> 39:00.303
you have conducted
an illegal investigation.

39:00.338 --> 39:04.859
You'’ve manipulated a witness,
you'’ve put a minor in danger.

39:04.894 --> 39:08.932
- Oh, please.
- Don'’t interrupt me, Bill.

39:08.967 --> 39:13.005
On top of that, you failed
at your actual job.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.662
No doubt because
you were so busy

39:14.697 --> 39:16.733
executing your pretend job.

39:16.768 --> 39:19.667
Which, I believe,
was going to earn you 20 quid.

39:21.117 --> 39:22.463
And which you both
seem to think

39:22.498 --> 39:24.638
is the most important thing
about this case.

39:24.672 --> 39:25.846
The most important thing
is that

39:25.880 --> 39:27.261
- I was right about the fact--
- No.

39:27.295 --> 39:29.125
No, the most
important thing, Eve,

39:29.159 --> 39:32.473
is that four people are dead
and it'’s all your fault.

39:45.900 --> 39:47.833
What were you right about?

39:52.700 --> 39:56.014
Kasia described the killer as
"ale decha",

39:56.048 --> 39:59.258
- which means flat-chested.
- How do you know that?

39:59.293 --> 40:01.433
Because I secretly recorded
the interview

40:01.468 --> 40:03.815
and brought it home
and asked Dom and my husband

40:03.849 --> 40:05.437
to translate it for me.

40:09.130 --> 40:10.338
You'’re fired.

40:10.373 --> 40:12.375
- You'’re a dick-swab.
- Oi!

40:12.410 --> 40:13.652
- Sorry.
- Thank you, Bill.

40:13.687 --> 40:16.621
No, I was gonna call you
a dick-swab.

40:20.797 --> 40:22.005
Clearly there'’s going to be

40:22.040 --> 40:24.905
some reshuffling
in your department.

40:26.251 --> 40:29.219
I suggest you both leave.
Immediately.

40:29.254 --> 40:30.980
Your things
will be biked to you.

40:36.779 --> 40:38.919

- You'’re fired.

at the shop?

come and, whatever this is.

41:41.222 --> 41:45.019

across ten countries.

41:45.054 --> 41:47.263
She'’s highly skilled.
As yet untraceable.

she'’s starting to show off.

42:07.179 --> 42:08.905
Right. Buy some milk.

42:08.940 --> 42:10.182
Oh.

42:10.217 --> 42:12.564
Or he'’ll think
you'’re having an affair.

42:12.599 --> 42:14.877
Oh, no, I don'’t think
he'’d ever think that.

42:14.911 --> 42:16.672
They all think
we'’re having affairs

42:16.706 --> 42:18.501
before they think
we'’re secret agents.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.676
Oh, no, I think Niko would
assume I was an agent

42:20.710 --> 42:23.575
before ever thinking that
I was having an affair.

42:23.610 --> 42:25.025
You might want to
make him think

you'’re having an affair, then.
