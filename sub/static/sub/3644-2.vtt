00:05.323 --> 00:06.639
MAGGIE: <i> Why did your
father kill himself?</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:09.274
- He didn't. And he wasn't my father.
- My name is Maggie Baptiste,

00:09.276 --> 00:10.709
and I'm working
on a project that needs

00:10.711 --> 00:13.178
someone with your particular aptitude.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.513
Welcome to
the Stitchers program.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.748
Has anyone ever done this before?

00:15.750 --> 00:17.383
Her name's Marta.
She couldn't handle it.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.352
We work for a secret
government agency

00:19.353 --> 00:21.320
that hacks into the brains of
corpses and reads their memories.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.255
Get out of here
before I tase both of you.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.723
Polygraphs don't work on me.
I fail them.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.325
Because of this
condition of yours.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.794
I know you don't get
relationships, like, at all.

00:28.796 --> 00:32.131
What's your problem that makes it
that you don't have any friends?

00:32.133 --> 00:34.633
- Whose bed did I just wake up in?
- Mine.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.269
We've been asked to look into the
death of a research scientist.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.705
He and his partner developed
the Stitchers technology.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.040
His name was Ed Clark.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.508
- Who was his partner?
- Your father.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.109
Why weren't you
and your father close?

00:44.111 --> 00:45.744
You're the Detective.
Detect.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.179
I'm in.

00:48.749 --> 00:52.184

<i>♪ O Cadillac car ♪</i>

01:07.768 --> 01:11.470
where's my stuff? I thought
you were kicking me out.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.472
Yeah, you know,

01:13.474 --> 01:16.341
about that...
I was just mad.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.444
I put it all back
into your room.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.245
Did you put everything
back where you got it?

01:20.247 --> 01:23.382
Don't be ridiculous.
So, tell me,

01:23.384 --> 01:26.118
did you guys
stop the bomber?

01:26.120 --> 01:28.821
Yeah, basically we prevented
U.C. Santa Monica's library

01:28.823 --> 01:30.823
from being turned
into a crater.

01:30.825 --> 01:32.591
Shut up.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.327
I can't believe you get
the dead to tell you stuff.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.496
- When do you do it again?
- Tomorrow.

01:37.498 --> 01:40.866
Uh, what...
what are you doing?

01:43.270 --> 01:45.437
I feel bad about...

01:45.439 --> 01:47.773
Just how I acted before,

01:47.775 --> 01:50.142
accusing you of
screwing up my project

01:50.144 --> 01:52.244
and getting you put
on academic suspension.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.346
So I went ahead and cooked us

01:54.348 --> 01:57.249
a let's-be-friends dinner.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.823
I'm trying to say I'm sorry.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.426
So this is what "sorry" looks like?

02:07.428 --> 02:09.828
Yeah.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.475
Seriously?

02:26.747 --> 02:28.847
Okay.

02:30.217 --> 02:33.185
And this is what "pissed off" looks like.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.698
I want it on the record that
I'm stitching you in under protest.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.834
- You keep records?
- Of course not. It's an expression.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.870
Comm links.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.905
We still don't know what happened
to you last time you got stitched.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.740
I touched something.
I saw stuff.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.543
- What's the big deal?
- Yeah, stitch happens. (Snickers)

02:59.446 --> 03:01.513
Okay, that never gets old. Right.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.549
You're not supposed to be able
to touch anything.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.817
You're in someone else's memory.
It's an intangible.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.619
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:07.621 --> 03:11.223
- Did I break your super-secret technology?
- Maybe.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.358
You should have seen
the monitors in the lab that day.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.960
They were going goofy
all at the same time.

03:14.962 --> 03:17.362
- Goofy?
- Goofy, zany... who cares?

03:17.364 --> 03:19.898
What I need to be able to understand
is how you were able to make

03:19.900 --> 03:21.934
physical contact with an
intangible memory object

03:21.936 --> 03:23.936
and why it put our computers'
panties in a twist.

03:23.938 --> 03:25.938
Panties in a twist?
Is that the actual terminology

03:25.940 --> 03:27.573
or just another expression?

03:27.575 --> 03:30.509
That's actual terminology we use.
We're men of science.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.781
How much time do we have?

03:35.782 --> 03:38.216
The sample's brain will degrade beyond
viability in less than 48 hours.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.985
The sample has a name... Ed Clark.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.520
Right. Sorry.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.389
Kirsten, I just want you to be safe.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.391
You think that

03:46.393 --> 03:48.527
because of what happened
to the other stitcher...

03:48.529 --> 03:50.662
- Marta.
- Right, Marta.

03:50.664 --> 03:53.398
You think that what happened
to her could happen to me?

03:53.400 --> 03:54.900
I don't know.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.768
Okay.

03:58.505 --> 04:01.006
Well, until you do, I'm going in.

04:01.008 --> 04:04.309
Look, I didn't connect with
Ed much, but he did raise me.

04:04.311 --> 04:06.945
I need to find out how he died,
for real.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.181
I owe him that at least.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.416
You sure you're ready for
what you might see in there?

04:11.418 --> 04:13.485
Let's find out.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.389
CAMERON: Stations, everyone.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.992

04:22.663 --> 04:25.864
Mission clock is set to five minutes.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.635

for stitch neurosync.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.770
(Electric hum)

04:31.772 --> 04:33.305
What the hell?

04:35.743 --> 04:37.042
Ed can wait.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.845
Something's come up.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.773
Lisa Keller, age 18.
Died last night

05:07.775 --> 05:10.008
at a rave in Hollywood
from a drug overdose.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.476
What was the drug?

05:11.478 --> 05:13.578
It's called burundanga.

05:13.580 --> 05:14.913
It comes from Colombia.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.915
It's affectionately known
as "the devil's breath"...

05:16.917 --> 05:19.751
basically the scariest
drug on the planet.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.640
Linus.

05:24.641 --> 05:26.325
At low dosages the drug acts
as a disinhibitor.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.026
It makes you do things
that you normally wouldn't do.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.629
But at high doses, the drug
causes disorientation,

05:30.631 --> 05:33.632
hallucinations, convulsions
and, ultimately, death.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.101
You stopped me from stitching
into Ed's memory

05:36.103 --> 05:37.869
for a drug investigation?

05:37.871 --> 05:40.605
I'm sorry, is keeping a horrific drug

05:40.607 --> 05:42.708
off the street
not worthy of your time?

05:42.710 --> 05:45.777
Ed's down to less than two days
before his memories degrade.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.980
This girl's memories have twice as long.
Do the math.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.516
This drug is new to L.A.
If it hits the street in quantity,

05:51.518 --> 05:53.719
we're looking at hundreds
of kids dead or dying.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.488
You see, I did do the math.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.524
You got me to be part of this
morbid confederation of yours

05:59.526 --> 06:01.593
by telling me I would get the chance

06:01.595 --> 06:03.695
to find out how Ed really died...
murder or suicide.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.964
And as long as there is
time remaining, you will,

06:05.966 --> 06:09.468
but after we find out
where Lisa got the drugs.

06:14.675 --> 06:15.874
Fine.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.010
Well, are we gonna do this?

06:24.985 --> 06:27.919
Date of birth... 13 June, 1991.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.589
No driver's license, due to a
medical condition of some kind.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.958
Mother, dead.
Father, unknown whereabouts.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.827
There are big holes
in her personal history.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.396
Your point, Fisher?

06:37.398 --> 06:39.531
There's something not right
with Kirsten Clark.

06:39.533 --> 06:43.034
The guy that everyone assumes is her
father, who she's not close to,

06:43.036 --> 06:45.504
is actually just a family
friend who raised her.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.639
And can you tell me
why she has the protection

06:47.641 --> 06:50.942
of some subdivision of a
subdivision of the N.S.A.?

06:50.944 --> 06:53.178
Let's say...
and this is a big let's-say...

06:53.180 --> 06:56.515
you're right.
You know what my advice would be?

06:56.517 --> 06:59.484
Let it go.
Whatever your Kirsten Clark's up to,

06:59.486 --> 07:02.187
it isn't L.A.P.D.
And, for sure, it isn't you.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.122
- Captain...
- Lisa Keller.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.124
O.D.'ed at a rave
last night in Hollywood.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.993
Open the investigation.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.128
Her mother is a judge,
so button this one down.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.831
The Kirsten Clark thing...

07:12.833 --> 07:15.066
let it go.

07:24.678 --> 07:28.146
This is Detective Quincy Fisher,
robbery/homicide.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.482
How soon can I get
the toxicology report

07:30.484 --> 07:33.185

from last night?

07:33.187 --> 07:35.720
Yes, Lisa Keller.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.624
What do you mean,
you can't find her body?

07:41.728 --> 07:44.129
I know it sounds like a big deal,
but it's not.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.631
You can't find a body.
How is that not a big deal?

07:46.633 --> 07:48.333
This is Los Angeles.

07:48.334 --> 07:50.034
We get a lot of bodies in and out of here.
It happens.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.770
You never lose your car keys?

07:51.772 --> 07:54.039
You did not just make
that comparison, did you?

08:01.849 --> 08:03.715
Definitely not Lisa Keller.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.584
Nope.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.519
Did you file a report?

08:07.521 --> 08:09.187
Look, Detective, you're new here,

08:09.189 --> 08:11.189
and I get that you want
to do things right.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.658
Just give me a day or two to
figure out where the breakdown is.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.527
I'll find your Lisa Keller.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.195
Trust me, wherever she is right now,

08:17.197 --> 08:19.164
she doesn't care.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.533
I'm gonna go interview
the rave promoter.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.569
I'll be back in a few hours.

08:24.571 --> 08:27.205
Find her body.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.508
Will do.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.749
(Door opens, closes)

08:41.221 --> 08:43.522
We may have a problem.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.838
Sample is online.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.841
She's so young.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.910

09:07.981 --> 09:09.748

- Can you hear me, tough guy?
- Yes, I hear you.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.783
Okay, we've mapped Lisa's
memories as best we can.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.919
As best we can? Is there a more
accomplished team I should be working with?

09:47.921 --> 09:49.321
She was on drugs.
It's unclear

09:49.323 --> 09:50.989
how that affects memory mapping.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.891
- Should I be worried?
- I'm not sure,

09:52.893 --> 09:55.126
but you'll tell me
in three, two, one.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.801
I can't...

10:36.803 --> 10:38.937
I can't really focus my eyes.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.639
I feel really odd.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.808
It's the memory of the drug kicking in.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.976
Okay, Lisa's memory is being
overtaken by the drugs.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.812
Okay, so put me back further.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.348
No can do. I can't map earlier than
a few minutes before she took it.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.351
Okay, the drugs are affecting our
ability to navigate the memory.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.986
- Do you want us to bounce you?
- No.

10:54.988 --> 10:58.089
No, no, I have to get this done.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.869
- Linus, can we still bounce her?
- No.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.938
We passed the two-minute
threshold 18 seconds ago.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.907
Okay, sporto, I'll
give you a shiny penny

11:48.909 --> 11:50.775
if you can get
your vitals down.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.761
- I'm... I'm bouncing.
- Remember...

12:09.763 --> 12:11.463
Yes, I know.
First name... Kirsten.

12:11.465 --> 12:13.298
Exit pin code...

12:13.300 --> 12:16.334
- iheartlinus.
- I am so changing that.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.371
(Gasps)

12:27.881 --> 12:29.347
Well?

12:29.349 --> 12:31.049
Lisa didn't O.D.,

12:31.051 --> 12:33.418
at least
not accidentally.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.520
She was murdered.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.161
I've been through
the police records.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.296
None of Lisa's friends were
out with her last night.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.765
KIRSTEN: What about Denise?

12:46.767 --> 12:48.833
I searched all of
Lisa's social media.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.335
She doesn't have any
friends by that name.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.303
No, it wasn't friendship
that I felt.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.438
It was...

12:53.440 --> 12:55.340
Protection.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.475
Lisa was trying to save
Denise from something.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.077
And that's what
got her killed?

12:59.079 --> 13:01.880
B-t-dubs, after Lisa was
forced to take the drugs,

13:01.882 --> 13:03.515
your heart rate
and respiration

13:03.517 --> 13:05.784
were jumping around like
they were booty poppin'.

13:05.786 --> 13:09.521
Yeah, the drugs, um...

13:10.791 --> 13:13.858
They turned everyone into monsters.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.334
Let me stitch into Ed.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.936
That's not going to happen

13:24.938 --> 13:26.504
until we conclude
this investigation.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.306
There's nothing else to see.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.208
The drugs distorted everything,

13:30.210 --> 13:33.244
and these teen titans don't have one
good idea between the two of them.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.846
Okay, that is so not true.

13:34.848 --> 13:37.482
I was thinking about
ordering a pizza.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.250
Let me stitch back
into Lisa then.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.252
I'll stick it out longer,
see if I missed anything.

13:41.254 --> 13:44.355
You have to wait until after the
absolute refractory period.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.591
- What?
- The absolute refractory period.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.359
It's the time needed
between stitches

13:48.361 --> 13:50.712
to allow the sample's
neurons to reset.

13:50.713 --> 13:53.064
It has to do with the potassium
transfer rate between cells.

13:53.066 --> 13:56.568
Just buy me a drink sometime,
and I'll tell you all about it.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.303
It's true.
He gets a few drinks in him,

13:58.305 --> 14:00.038
and that's all
he ever talks about.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.373
How long is the absolute
refractory period?

14:02.375 --> 14:05.176
Between five
and, what, 12 hours.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.145
Each sample and stitch is different.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.280
Okay, so stitch me into Ed
while we're waiting.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.916
The equipment can only be tuned
to one person at a time.

14:11.918 --> 14:14.152
We don't have time
to switch Lisa for Ed.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.554
Wait out the refractory period.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.623
You'll stitch Lisa again,
and then afterwards

14:18.625 --> 14:20.892
we will talk about Ed.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.632
Is it okay
if I go home and rest?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.634
The stitch made me pretty tired.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.970
Absolutely.
You need a ride?

14:31.972 --> 14:33.438
Yeah.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.106
That's so nice of you.

14:35.108 --> 14:38.643
Linus, while we're gone,
run the numbers.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.378
See if we can come up
with any code

14:40.380 --> 14:42.380
to cancel out the effect of
the drugs on the memory.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.415
Now I'm definitely
ordering a pizza.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.252
Hey, would it be okay if we made a
quick stop on the way to my house?

14:47.254 --> 14:49.520
Yeah.

- The r...

15:08.341 --> 15:10.975
Hey, hold up.

15:10.977 --> 15:13.945
Kirsten, wait, hold.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.447
Wait. Hey.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.449
Hey, look.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.451
You lied to me, okay?

15:20.453 --> 15:22.220
We're on the same team,
and you lied to me.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.188
We have to trust each other.
That's the only way

15:24.190 --> 15:26.591
- we're going to be able to work together.
- You done?

15:26.593 --> 15:30.228
Allow me to make a few
clarifying statements.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.697
We're not teammates.
We're not coworkers.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.966
I'm doing this for the sole
purpose of getting the chance

15:34.968 --> 15:36.634
to learn what really
happened to Ed,

15:36.636 --> 15:38.569
and then I'm done
with you and Maggie

15:38.571 --> 15:40.338
and your whole freak show.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.374
Well, that definitely is clarifying.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.978
Look, I'm...

15:46.980 --> 15:49.047
I'm sorry about
the freak show comment.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.082
But let's be logical about this.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.084
We want to get the drugs
off the streets, yes?

15:53.086 --> 15:55.086
Lisa's memories were distorted.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.355
Maybe being in the actual
place where she died

15:57.357 --> 16:00.024
will help me remember more
clearly the things that I saw.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.545
Okay.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.530
But we keep a low profile
and, by Grabthar's hammer,

16:05.532 --> 16:08.166
please try
not to piss anyone off...

16:08.168 --> 16:10.601
Like you usually do.

16:12.439 --> 16:15.273
MAN: I'm not interested in
whatever edgy new beats

16:15.275 --> 16:17.141
you think are gonna
set the scene on fire.

16:17.143 --> 16:20.011
You want to play that garbage out here?
Go start a record label.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.313
Anything look familiar?

16:22.315 --> 16:24.415
Yeah, that douchebag over there.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.284
(Muttering)
No. Damn,

16:26.286 --> 16:27.719
damn, damn,
damnedy, damn, damn.

16:27.721 --> 16:29.687
Tickets don't go on sale till 9:00.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.489
Who killed Lisa Keller?

16:32.425 --> 16:34.258
I don't know.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.260
Drugs, according to the newspaper.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.262
And who gave her the drugs?

16:38.264 --> 16:40.064
I don't know.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.300
And you know how you know
I'm telling the truth?

16:42.302 --> 16:44.068
Because I'm running a business,

16:44.070 --> 16:46.504
and dead kids...
they don't pay to come to raves.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.106
Really?
That's where you went with that?

16:48.108 --> 16:49.540
What about the guy with the camera,

16:49.542 --> 16:51.509
taking pictures?
Maybe he saw something.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.111
That would be Raff.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.513
He's my official
unofficial photographer,

16:55.515 --> 16:57.715
but I wouldn't bother him.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.752
Raff isn't nice...
Like Cleaver here.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.626
We're not afraid of you.

17:08.627 --> 17:11.095
(Growls)

17:17.069 --> 17:18.536
I don't know why you're so mad.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.939
We know more now than we did before.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.340
Yep, we know that when I'm confronted by
a bouncer named Cleaver, I leak urine.

17:23.343 --> 17:26.210
Okay, how do I do this?

17:26.212 --> 17:28.413
Say I'm sorry?

17:28.415 --> 17:30.481
We shake hands?

17:30.483 --> 17:34.218
Oh, you really don't know
how to apologize, do you?

17:34.220 --> 17:37.088
No, it's not really one of my skills.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.756
Oh, Maggie's gonna kill us.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.591
Okay, man up, stud.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.560
Maggie needs us more
than we need Maggie.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.096
Man down, buttercup.
I mean, she can actually kill us.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.832
She's a former C.I.A. assassin.

17:47.834 --> 17:51.402
Oh, I suppose this was not
to be unexpected.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.539
Miss Clark.

17:55.508 --> 17:58.209
- Nerdy guy.
- It's Cameron.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.644
What are you two doing here?

17:59.646 --> 18:01.913
I'm afraid that's above
your pay grade, Detective.

18:01.915 --> 18:05.583
Don't tell me:
a secret agency mission, right?

18:05.585 --> 18:08.519
Well, if we told you,

18:08.521 --> 18:10.188
it wouldn't be a secret, would it?

18:10.190 --> 18:13.291
The name Lisa Keller mean
anything to either of you?

18:13.293 --> 18:16.427
Fisher, do you play chess?

18:18.098 --> 18:20.164
- No.
- Well, I do.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.500
Queen takes knight.

18:25.772 --> 18:29.874
I'm a "Settlers of Catan" man myself.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.683
So what exactly do we know now

18:38.685 --> 18:40.818
that we didn't know before?
The name Raff?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.820
- Yes.
- Okay, that's not even a real name.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.423
How are we supposed to find this guy?
We have no idea who he is.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.158
But we know
where he's gonna be.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.193
- Take me home.
- Like, for reals?

18:49.195 --> 18:51.229
Or are you gonna make me
take you someplace awful?

18:51.231 --> 18:52.797
For real...

18:52.799 --> 18:54.866
Then I'll make you
take me someplace awful.

- Cameron and I are going.

19:14.454 --> 19:17.188

to one of these before?

22:54.907 --> 22:57.675
- Buddies?
- Or... something.

22:57.677 --> 23:00.678
- I'll let you know when I spot Raff.
- Right.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.837
You... you ever been
to a rave before?

23:26.839 --> 23:29.573
No, but I feel like I have.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.830
Yeah, you dance nice.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.633
- What?
- I said you dance nice!

23:55.635 --> 23:57.735
- Oh, I take zumba.
- What?

23:57.737 --> 23:59.437
Zumba!

23:59.439 --> 24:00.571
Okay.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.173
So who are we looking for, anyway?

24:02.175 --> 24:04.875
I have no clue!

24:05.978 --> 24:07.845
Okay, you look like a cop.

24:07.847 --> 24:09.146
What?

24:09.148 --> 24:11.849
You gotta blend in.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.452
Dance!

24:14.454 --> 24:17.955
I said I don't rave,
never said I don't dance.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.226
What are you doing?

24:22.228 --> 24:24.695
Helping a sister out.
Come on.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.950
(Laughs)

24:48.120 --> 24:49.920
Hey.

24:51.224 --> 24:52.790
Oh. Oh. Okay.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.094
Not bad.
You're a fast learner.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.163
- There we go.
- Thank you.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.503
There she is. It's Denise.

25:12.912 --> 25:15.679
- (Cheering)
- (Dance music playing)

25:18.918 --> 25:21.252
- You're Denise.
- Who are you?

25:21.254 --> 25:22.953
We're friends of Lisa Keller's.

25:22.955 --> 25:25.256
I saw her die.

25:25.258 --> 25:27.591
I know. I was there.

25:27.593 --> 25:30.027
Where is that ass-hat Raff?

25:31.097 --> 25:32.229
I think we found him.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.265
Why are you talking
to my girlfriend?

25:34.267 --> 25:37.635
In truth, I never said a word to her.
Right?

25:37.637 --> 25:40.070
Well, before that one.

25:42.575 --> 25:45.175
(Distorted speech)

25:48.548 --> 25:49.947
We're gonna get you out of here.

25:49.949 --> 25:51.649
Hey, who told you
where to find us?

25:51.651 --> 25:54.218
Lisa, this morning.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.853
Let me handle this.

25:55.855 --> 25:59.823
You a...
"Settlers of Catan" man?

26:02.161 --> 26:04.828
More of a "Risk" guy, I see.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.334
- Seriously?
- Okay, he had a knife.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.636
Do you have a death wish?

26:16.876 --> 26:19.910
Whoa. Hey, yo, we're dancing here.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.982
Oh, that's them.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.851
Remember me?

26:27.853 --> 26:29.920
Excuse me. Excuse me.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.956
I know you'll remember <i>me.</i>

26:35.728 --> 26:37.127
BOTH: Woof!

26:37.129 --> 26:39.229
She has a taser?

26:41.601 --> 26:43.300
Damn it.
Okay, let's split up.

26:43.302 --> 26:44.969
You two search the back
half of the parking lot.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.670
Cameron and I will look for
them around the front.

26:46.672 --> 26:48.305
- Look for who?
- Not now, Fisher.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.975
- Stop.
- I have to go. I have to save her.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.643
I said stop.

26:52.645 --> 26:55.012
- CAMERON: Kirsten.
- CAMILLE: Kirsten, stop now.

26:56.649 --> 26:58.782
All of you,
face down on the ground, now.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.784
Come on, man.
This is my best kurta.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.052
Now.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.262
You play football, Miss Clark?

27:13.799 --> 27:15.065
I do.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.634
Touchdown.

27:16.636 --> 27:18.802
We're investigating
the death of Lisa Keller.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.405
- Please stop talking.
- She didn't O.D. She was murdered.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.140
And how do you know this?

27:24.677 --> 27:26.944
Because we hacked into
her brain after she died

27:26.946 --> 27:29.668
and read her memories.
It's called "stitching."

27:29.682 --> 27:32.950
Is there anyone in Los Angeles
you haven't told about us?

27:35.788 --> 27:37.755
All of you, up.

27:41.027 --> 27:43.127
I can prove it.

27:57.443 --> 28:00.711
You gotta be freakin' kidding me.

28:00.713 --> 28:04.148
You gotta be freakin' kidding me.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.718
What the hell is going on?

28:07.720 --> 28:10.988
Maggie, you remember
Detective Fisher, don't you?

28:10.990 --> 28:12.990
Who authorized this?

28:12.992 --> 28:15.392
Well, if it makes a difference,
I was going to arrest them,

28:15.394 --> 28:17.461
until Kirsten offered to bring me here.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.263
It doesn't make a difference.

28:19.265 --> 28:20.798
Well, I think we've established

28:20.800 --> 28:22.399
that you can't stop us
from doing fieldwork,

28:22.401 --> 28:23.934
so I figured it would be helpful

28:23.936 --> 28:25.869
to have someone from the L.A.P.D
on the team.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.805
Figuring out stuff is not your job,

28:27.807 --> 28:29.940
and you were under strict orders

28:29.942 --> 28:32.309
only to observe Kirsten
and report back to me,

28:32.311 --> 28:35.813
not divulge your involvement
with the program.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.414
You're with the program?

28:40.820 --> 28:43.253
You know, I actually
hadn't mentioned that

28:43.255 --> 28:47.057
to anybody yet,
so that one's on you.

28:49.295 --> 28:50.828
Kirsten, wait.

28:52.898 --> 28:56.200
Fisher, come with me, please.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.841
When you woke up this morning,
did you think

29:03.843 --> 29:05.476
- the day was gonna turn out like this?
- Hm-mmm.

29:05.478 --> 29:06.910
Me neither.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.812
Hold up. Come on.
Will you wait?

29:08.814 --> 29:10.447
Don't touch me.
You lied to me.

29:10.449 --> 29:12.049
I did not.

29:12.051 --> 29:14.318
I didn't volunteer the truth,
but I never lied.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.286
How long have you been
spying on me for?

29:18.891 --> 29:22.292
Pretty much the entire last year.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.995
Look, after we became roommates,

29:24.997 --> 29:28.298
Maggie had me brought in
here and made me an offer.

29:28.300 --> 29:31.001
They'd pay all my expenses

29:31.003 --> 29:34.071
and my grad school costs
if I just spied on you.

29:34.073 --> 29:37.207
All your living expenses
and tuition costs?

29:37.209 --> 29:38.342
Mm-hmm.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.077
That is a pretty good offer.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.945
I know, right?

29:41.947 --> 29:44.214
And all I had to do was
just keep track of you

29:44.216 --> 29:47.151
and report back if you
did anything strange.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.136
And did you?

29:49.137 --> 29:51.120
I didn't know what to report.
Everything you do is strange.

29:51.123 --> 29:54.158
And my academic suspension...
that thing with your research?

29:54.160 --> 29:56.293
They put me up to that.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.030
Look, they needed you...

30:00.032 --> 30:01.932
Badly,

30:01.934 --> 30:05.235
and they wanted to incentivize
you to join the program.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.504
And you wonder why

30:07.506 --> 30:10.240
I have such a hard time making friends.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.478
(Sighs)

30:16.115 --> 30:17.881
So...

30:19.118 --> 30:20.517
Looks like our Kirsten

30:20.519 --> 30:22.252
outplayed both of us on this one.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.822
She's, uh...

30:24.824 --> 30:26.356
Something different.

30:26.358 --> 30:29.326
You don't know the half of it.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.829
Does this actually work?

30:31.831 --> 30:33.397
Stitching?

30:33.399 --> 30:35.465
Yes.

30:38.437 --> 30:40.337
So what are you going to do
with the knowledge

30:40.339 --> 30:42.406
you now have about our program?

30:43.976 --> 30:45.509
I haven't decided.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.377
Well, let me help you
make the right choice.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.613
After we met yesterday,
I did some research,

30:49.615 --> 30:51.515
on you.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.417
What did you find out?

30:53.419 --> 30:55.552
I found out you're like a pit bull.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.421
Once you bite down on a case,

30:57.423 --> 30:59.323
your jaw locks
and you don't let go.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.325
But while that may be admirable in a cop,

31:01.327 --> 31:03.994
it's a lousy trait in a husband.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.063
Hey, stay in your lane.

31:06.065 --> 31:09.099
Your dogged pursuit at work has
already cost you your marriage

31:09.101 --> 31:11.101
and will likely lead you

31:11.103 --> 31:14.204
to be transferred to
another division, again.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.240
Okay, I think I'm done here.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.041
I also know you're smart,

31:18.043 --> 31:19.943
and you've been poking around

31:19.945 --> 31:21.511
the medical examiner's office.

31:21.513 --> 31:25.349
I know this because the M.E.
is embedded in our program.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.517
That's how we get our samples.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.921
Who are you people?

31:30.923 --> 31:32.623
We're a federal agency

31:32.625 --> 31:35.325
with a very wide jurisdiction.

31:35.327 --> 31:37.327
Including over the L.A.P.D.?

31:37.329 --> 31:40.530
Particularly the L.A.P.D.

31:40.532 --> 31:42.532
Fisher,

31:42.534 --> 31:45.402
you are the least popular

31:45.404 --> 31:47.137
honest Detective in all of L.A.,

31:47.139 --> 31:49.473
but become part of
the Stitchers program...

31:49.475 --> 31:51.475
I can make you the most successful

31:51.477 --> 31:55.145
least popular honest Detective
in all of L.A.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.381
So I'm being recruited?

31:57.383 --> 31:59.349
Kirsten is right.
It's obvious

31:59.351 --> 32:01.485
I can't keep them
from doing field work.

32:01.487 --> 32:04.554
And, frankly,
I'm not sure I should.

32:04.556 --> 32:07.090
She sees things when
she's being stitched

32:07.092 --> 32:09.092
that only she can follow up on.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.028
She's going to need
some kind of backup.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.529
Me?

32:12.531 --> 32:14.331
You will remain L.A.P.D.,

32:14.333 --> 32:16.433
but on deep-cover loan
to the Stitchers program.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.368
Keep my kids safe.
And in return,

32:18.370 --> 32:21.438
I will give you the official
collar when we close a case.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.507
I can't take credit
for someone else's work.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.375
We're a team.
We all take credit.

32:25.377 --> 32:27.144
We all share the blame.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.981
You know how to be part
of a team, don't you?

32:30.983 --> 32:32.582
Refractory period is over.

32:32.584 --> 32:36.119
We can stitch into Lisa Keller again.

32:36.121 --> 32:39.122
Care to see what you've
just agreed to be a part of?

32:39.124 --> 32:42.159
I think you may be the devil.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.660
I'm not,

32:43.662 --> 32:46.496
but I admire his closing rate.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.377
AYO: Her heart rate is elevating.

33:02.047 --> 33:04.414
Listen, geniuses,

33:04.416 --> 33:06.283
I'm still surrounded by monsters.

33:06.285 --> 33:09.252
Whatever you did to cancel out the
effects of the drugs isn't working.

33:09.254 --> 33:11.154
Because we haven't done it yet. Linus.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.190
Running the filter...

33:15.494 --> 33:17.194
Now.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.497
CAMERON: Okay, talk to me.
How's it looking?

33:20.499 --> 33:22.566
Better. Much better.

33:22.568 --> 33:24.167
AYO: Her vitals are stabilizing.

33:24.169 --> 33:27.771
Now you know what 20 minutes
into the future looks like.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.242
I see them.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.013
Cameron.

33:36.015 --> 33:38.181
Isolate and reduce the volume
of the background music.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.751
Give us a moment.

33:40.753 --> 33:42.719
I'm going to get you out of here.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.488
To where?
Back to the shelter?

33:44.490 --> 33:46.556
For now. Then I'm gonna
get you home to Montana.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.425
Raff will take care of me.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.494
He says he's got a big score coming.

33:50.496 --> 33:53.497
A big score? Stay here.

33:59.038 --> 34:00.670
She's done with you.
Got that?

34:00.672 --> 34:02.472
Girl, you are hot
when you're pissed off.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.641
You haven't even seen me
pissed off yet.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.610
I know about your big score.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.612
You keep Denise out of it.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.681
Whoa! Now I'm worried.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.818
Let go of me.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.755
You think you're special?

34:20.391 --> 34:22.759
Working with runaways,

34:22.761 --> 34:25.228
trying to save them?

34:25.230 --> 34:28.130
Well, save yourself.

34:30.469 --> 34:33.402
Raff's forcing the drugs
into Lisa's mouth.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.842
Sweet dreams.

34:57.129 --> 34:58.595
Denise, let me help you.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.197
It's too late.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.900
Denise, get back in here.

35:19.685 --> 35:21.518
I'm bouncing.

35:25.691 --> 35:29.126
11545 San Fernando Road. The
drugs are in Raff's camera case.

35:29.128 --> 35:30.981
Lisa Keller used to work
with runaway teens.

35:30.982 --> 35:32.126
That's how she met Denise.

35:32.164 --> 35:35.165
Lisa was trying to get Denise
away from Raff, so he killed her.

35:35.167 --> 35:36.633
- Certainty?
- 100%.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.302
- We're gonna need a warrant.
- Based on what?

35:39.304 --> 35:41.271
I'm confident you'll
figure something out.

35:41.273 --> 35:43.240
Hey, Fisher.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.743
Welcome to
the Stitchers program.

35:57.723 --> 36:00.590
RAFF: Listen, man, this stuff
is not available anywhere.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.659
Yeah, just like that show,

36:02.661 --> 36:05.829
except for this is green,
not blue, and it's for real.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.431
Listen, I want to put you on my list,
but you gotta commit.

36:08.433 --> 36:10.467
My man.

36:10.469 --> 36:12.836
(Crying)

36:21.880 --> 36:23.880
What are you crying about?

36:23.882 --> 36:25.849
Huh?

36:25.851 --> 36:28.285
I don't want anything to do with this.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.753
When we first met,

36:29.755 --> 36:32.656
you never told me
anything about drugs.

36:36.195 --> 36:38.395
I understand.

36:38.397 --> 36:39.829
I do. I get it.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.400
So what you're telling me
is that you want

36:43.402 --> 36:45.702
to be back on the streets.

36:45.704 --> 36:49.439
Is that what you're telling me, huh?

36:49.441 --> 36:51.308
'Cause that's where I'll dump you...

36:51.310 --> 36:52.943
right where I found you.

36:52.945 --> 36:54.878
I just want to go home.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.514
Baby, you are home.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.616
(Crash)

37:08.560 --> 37:10.694
Victor Thomas,
you're under arrest

37:10.696 --> 37:12.562
for the murder of Lisa Keller.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.398
Denise, my name is Kirsten.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.501
We're gonna get you out of here.

37:18.503 --> 37:19.936
Sit down.

37:19.938 --> 37:22.272
How did you know where I was?

37:22.274 --> 37:24.941
Lisa told me.

37:24.943 --> 37:27.811
- Aren't you supposed to read me my rights?
- Eventually.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.579
- (Computer beeps)
- His computer's password-protected.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.948
Password, please.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.817
What do you need that for?

37:33.819 --> 37:35.885
Because it's faster than
hacking into your computer

37:35.887 --> 37:37.754
to figure out where you're
getting your drugs from.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.756
- Password.
- Screw you.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.794
Password, please.

37:46.365 --> 37:47.831
This is police brutality.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.833
Too bad for you we're not the police.

37:53.338 --> 37:54.804
(Taser crackles)

37:59.578 --> 38:01.011
I'm gonna go get changed.

38:01.013 --> 38:04.447
Oh, good. You're here.
Did you get the call

38:04.449 --> 38:06.316
- about prepping Ed for being stitched?
- Yes, I did, but...

38:06.318 --> 38:08.485
Hey, Cameron, how quickly can
you change the computers over?

38:08.487 --> 38:10.053
Guys, wait. Listen.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.422
It's too late.

38:19.531 --> 38:22.399
- No, this isn't right.
- What's not right?

38:32.978 --> 38:34.844
Ed's hit his best-by date.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.746
He can no longer be stitched.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.615
That's bull.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.317
No, it's true.
His neural gaps

38:40.319 --> 38:41.718
have widened beyond stimulation.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.520
There's nothing to stitch.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.021
I'm sorry.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.324
Kirsten, I'm so sorry.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.643
You knew exactly what you were doing.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.545
You deliberately brought in
the Keller case

39:08.547 --> 39:10.113
to keep me from stitching
into Ed's memory.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.781
You give me too much credit.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.650
Did they know?
Were they a part of your plan...

39:13.652 --> 39:14.818
Camille, Linus and Cameron?

39:14.820 --> 39:17.387
No, because there was no plan.

39:17.389 --> 39:20.056
I'm sorry about Ed,
but this happens sometimes.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.392
You promised me.

39:22.394 --> 39:25.362
No, I said that if you can solve
the Keller case fast enough,

39:25.364 --> 39:27.397
you can stitch into Ed.

39:27.399 --> 39:30.066
You didn't. And you can't.

39:30.068 --> 39:33.670
What is it that Ed knows that
you don't want me to see?

39:33.672 --> 39:36.806
The reason I hardly remember my parents,

39:36.808 --> 39:38.675
or where my father is?

39:38.677 --> 39:41.478
The truth about who really killed Ed?

39:43.949 --> 39:45.615
Come with me.

39:54.693 --> 39:57.994
As we speak,
Ed's apartment is being boxed up.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.963
Tomorrow all of his stuff
will be delivered

39:59.965 --> 40:01.965
to the home that he left you.

40:01.967 --> 40:04.534
Every shred of paper,
photograph, book,

40:04.536 --> 40:06.936
flash drive, and dust bunny

40:06.938 --> 40:10.573
is going to be yours.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.575
Perhaps the answers
that you're looking for

40:12.577 --> 40:14.811
will be in those boxes.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.617
Look at her,

40:20.619 --> 40:22.519
because I need you to understand,

40:22.521 --> 40:24.120
all of you,

40:24.122 --> 40:26.723
what you did here today.

40:26.725 --> 40:30.560
Where would Denise be
without the Stitchers program?

40:30.562 --> 40:32.562
Kirsten,

40:32.564 --> 40:34.831
you gave Lisa Keller back her voice,

40:34.833 --> 40:36.833
even if only for a short time,

40:36.835 --> 40:38.868
to finish what she started.

40:38.870 --> 40:42.005
You know those monsters
that you saw in her memory?

40:42.007 --> 40:44.707
Well, there are monsters everywhere,

40:44.709 --> 40:48.011
and with this technology,
we can stop them.

40:54.753 --> 40:57.887
(Sighs)
I looked, Kirsten.

40:57.889 --> 41:00.790
There aren't any monsters under your bed.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.928
Look again, Ed.

41:06.231 --> 41:09.199
There are no such thing as monsters.

41:13.705 --> 41:16.639
Well, I never did like monsters.

41:18.009 --> 41:19.909
Let's go get 'em.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.722
(Heart monitor beeping)

42:40.093 --> 42:45.093
