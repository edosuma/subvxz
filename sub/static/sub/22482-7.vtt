WEBVTT

00:03.171 --> 00:05.773
Mmm, somebody smells nice.
Ah.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.175
I pretended to buy makeup

00:07.208 --> 00:09.643
so I could swipe
perfume samples at Macy's.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.112
(chuckles)

00:11.145 --> 00:13.147
Looks like the
forecast is cloudy

00:13.181 --> 00:15.649
with a chance of doing it.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.251
Can you guys go somewhere else

00:17.285 --> 00:19.520
to talk about Christy
banging my brother?

00:19.553 --> 00:20.821
No one's banging anyone.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.057
We decided to get
to know each other first.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.792
I'm sorry, but having sex

00:24.825 --> 00:28.129
is how you get
to know each other.

00:28.162 --> 00:31.031
If I could carry the TV
into the kitchen, I would.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.834
All I'm saying is

00:33.867 --> 00:36.137
there's a real danger
in waiting, Christy.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.272
You could develop serious
feelings for Patrick

00:38.306 --> 00:40.174
and then find out he's
got a crooked unit.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.810
Well, that wouldn't
matter to me.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.145
Ugh. All right.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.713
It's already too late.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.681
Help us out here, Adam.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.083
You guys grew up together.

00:49.117 --> 00:50.284
Bathing, skinny-dipping--

00:50.318 --> 00:54.155
is there anything exotic or
unorthodox in the swimsuit area?

00:54.188 --> 00:57.858
If death took me right now,
I would not hate it.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.864
So, where are we going?

01:03.897 --> 01:06.200
Well, Christy, as
you may have gleaned,

01:06.234 --> 01:09.103
I am something of a planner.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.305
So I made two
dinner reservations

01:11.339 --> 01:14.442
at equally fine restaurants,
and you get to pick.

01:14.475 --> 01:17.378
Wow. You made reservations,

01:17.411 --> 01:19.580
you're not married,
you're not wearing cargo shorts.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.814
I'm getting a little dizzy.

01:20.848 --> 01:24.252
(chuckles) Well, before you
pass out, here are your choices.

01:24.285 --> 01:27.188
Steak house known
for their prime rib,

01:27.221 --> 01:29.457
seafood place known
for their lobster.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.724
Steak house.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.360
Lobster freaks me out.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.728
It's a giant sea bug
and I'm not having it.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.230
Right?

01:36.264 --> 01:37.865
Sometimes they make
you pick out your own.

01:37.898 --> 01:40.201
I don't want to decide
which one dies.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.669
Who made me lobster god?

01:41.702 --> 01:44.238
(laughs)

01:44.272 --> 01:48.242
Ugh. Speaking of giant
sea bugs, it's my mom.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.911
Watch. This is my most
favorite thing in the world.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.381
Ignore.
(chuckles)

01:53.414 --> 01:55.883
Really? Most favorite?

01:55.916 --> 01:57.351
Mine's water slides.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.753
(chuckles)

01:59.787 --> 02:02.556
Oh, for God's sake, Mom.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.225
Sorry, I better take this.

02:04.258 --> 02:08.162
I'm on a date, which you know.
Why are you calling?

02:09.830 --> 02:11.699
Oh, okay.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.133
I'll be right there.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.536
I'm sorry.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.405
I'm gonna need a rain check.

02:17.438 --> 02:20.140
My friend Marjorie's husband
had a stroke.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.413
*

02:39.960 --> 02:42.396
He just collapsed
right there in the hall.

02:42.430 --> 02:45.333
Well, you got him to
the hospital right away.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.268
That's always the
most important thing.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.936
Yes. That's the important thing.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.538
That and life insurance.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.805
Mom.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.208
He can't get coverage now.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.544
A word.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.212
We'll be right back.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.315
What is wrong with you?

03:01.349 --> 03:03.551
What? That's
a legitimate question.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.486
Have you priced
a casket lately?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.321
Have you?

03:07.355 --> 03:09.457
Yeah, when you had that cough
that wouldn't go away.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.427
Okay, from now on,

03:13.461 --> 03:16.230
if you have the urge
to say something, don't.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.731
So I'm just supposed
to sit there?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.967
No. Try to be helpful.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.236
Offer her a cup of
tea or something.
Ugh.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.737
I'll try, but I know
a thing or two

03:23.771 --> 03:26.440
about freezing a dead guy's
head, so if there's a lull,

03:26.474 --> 03:28.542
I might bring it up.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.980
Wendy, how is he?

03:33.013 --> 03:35.015
He's out of surgery
and stable.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.717
Oh, thank God.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.986
Oh, that's great news.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.020
Stable is good.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.455
Can I see him?

03:41.489 --> 03:43.357
In a few hours when
we move him to ICU.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.659
Oh, so I guess what
Victor's saying is,

03:45.693 --> 03:48.429
"I-C-U in a few hours."

03:50.531 --> 03:53.233
Would you like some tea?

03:55.369 --> 03:57.338
Mmm, pass me the popcorn.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.540
(sportscaster speaking
indistinctly over television)

04:04.645 --> 04:06.280
You ate it all.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.282
Why would you hand
me an empty bowl?

04:08.316 --> 04:11.619
'Cause I wanted you
to know that I ate it all.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.020
(sighs) Well,
to that I say,

04:13.053 --> 04:14.422
why are you
hitting yourself,

04:14.455 --> 04:15.756
why are you hitting
yourself, huh?
Ow.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.291
Quit it!

04:17.325 --> 04:19.760
What a...

04:19.793 --> 04:21.395
So, what are we
supposed to do?

04:21.429 --> 04:22.830
Stay up all night?
What's the plan?

04:22.863 --> 04:24.432
Plan?
Yeah.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.901
(chuckles)
Dude, you're in Plunkettville.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.537
There are no plans.

04:29.570 --> 04:30.671
What does that mean?

04:30.704 --> 04:32.773
This is how it works
when you date

04:32.806 --> 04:34.442
an aggressively
sober woman.

04:34.475 --> 04:37.077
They have a lot of friends
with a lot of problems

04:37.110 --> 04:39.413
and they show up
for everything together.

04:39.447 --> 04:40.781
When there's a crisis,

04:40.814 --> 04:43.551
they shine the AA signal
on a cloud.

04:45.419 --> 04:48.322
And then they're gone for hours.

04:48.356 --> 04:51.592
So they're like superheroes
with a weakness for gin?

04:51.625 --> 04:54.428
Pretty much.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.397
AA is kind of Bonnie
and Christy's whole life,

04:56.430 --> 04:57.931
but I found a way
to work around it.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.867
I got Bonnie to do her
meetings on Monday night,

04:59.900 --> 05:01.435
Thursday night
and Sunday night.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.536
Wow.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.438
Wow.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.674
You-you found a way to
watch prime-time football

05:06.707 --> 05:08.976
and make it look
like a favor.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.412
I told my buddies
at the sports bar.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.881
They're thinking of
building me a shrine.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.416
You deserve one.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.451
Yeah, and I always have
a designated driver,

05:17.485 --> 05:19.553
but I'm not supposed to be
too happy about it

05:19.587 --> 05:20.988
or it's a red flag.

05:21.021 --> 05:24.425
(phone chimes)

05:24.458 --> 05:25.826
Ah, Bonnie.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.496
She says that Victor's stable,

05:28.529 --> 05:30.431
but that they're gonna
spend the night

05:30.464 --> 05:31.298
in the hospital with Marjorie.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.634
Oh, well, maybe I should
go over there

05:33.667 --> 05:35.469
and bring Christy
a change of clothes.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.638
Oh, no, no, no. No way.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.972
Well, why not?

05:39.006 --> 05:40.073
Because if you bring
Christy something,

05:40.107 --> 05:43.010
I got to bring Bonnie
something or I look like a tool.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.378
You are a tool.

05:44.412 --> 05:47.581
Ooh, sneak attack. Oh!
Oh!

05:47.615 --> 05:49.983
Oh-ho!

05:50.017 --> 05:52.486
JILL:
Hey, how's Victor doing?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.388
I thought you were
on a silent retreat.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.523
I am.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.725
But I'm worried about Marjorie

05:57.758 --> 05:59.860
and I'm dying to talk.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.496
(sighs) My thoughts have been
all bottled up in my head

06:02.530 --> 06:04.498
and it's making me...

06:05.966 --> 06:07.801
Jill?

06:07.835 --> 06:09.737
Shh.

06:09.770 --> 06:13.907
Sorry. Shaman Gary came
into the Zen garden.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.477
He is such a narc.

06:16.510 --> 06:19.480
Victor is stable.
That's all we know.

06:19.513 --> 06:22.516
Oh, thank God.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.518
Is that a vending machine
behind you?

06:25.919 --> 06:28.489
Do they have Funyuns?

06:28.522 --> 06:30.558
Last night I dreamt
about Funyuns.

06:30.591 --> 06:33.093
(laughs) Except they were
six feet tall and kissing me.

06:34.662 --> 06:37.598
I'm telling you, nothing's
getting satisfied here.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.901
Uh-oh, Gary's back.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.903
I got to hide you in my bra.

06:42.936 --> 06:46.440
Is it just me or does it look
like she hasn't lost a pound?

06:46.474 --> 06:48.776
If anything, her
face looks rounder.
(chuckles)

06:48.809 --> 06:51.812
Hey, I'm still here.

06:51.845 --> 06:55.215
Hey, Marjorie, what'd they say?

06:55.248 --> 06:57.685
They told me to
hope for the best

06:57.718 --> 06:59.186
and prepare for the worst.

06:59.219 --> 07:02.189
Might not be able
to walk or talk.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.525
Oh, my God.

07:04.558 --> 07:07.060
Well...

07:07.094 --> 07:09.062
whatever happens,

07:09.096 --> 07:11.131
you won't face it alone.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.000
You have friends
you can count on.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.068
Thanks, Christy.

07:15.102 --> 07:19.540
I'll be happy to help, too.

07:19.573 --> 07:22.743
I'm actually quite good
at taking care of sick people.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.545
Since when?

07:24.578 --> 07:27.681
I thought I could just say it
and you'd believe me.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.650
Sometimes it works
'cause I'm tall.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.820
Hey.
Hi.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.087
Patrick.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.255
What are you doing here?

07:35.288 --> 07:37.558
Oh, he wanted to bring
Christy some clothes

07:37.591 --> 07:39.560
and I didn't want to
show up empty-handed,

07:39.593 --> 07:40.961
so here's that sudoku
you've been working on

07:40.994 --> 07:42.496
for the last year.

07:43.597 --> 07:46.700
Really sorry to hear
about your husband.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.502
Thank you.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.904
This is Adam's brother,
Patrick.

07:50.938 --> 07:54.575
Hi. I wish we were meeting
under better circumstances.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.709
Thanks.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.745
And I'm sorry I ruined
your evening.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.513
Ah.

07:59.547 --> 08:02.916
You know, why don't you two
go down to the cafeteria

08:02.950 --> 08:04.585
and grab a bite to eat?

08:04.618 --> 08:06.119
You sure?
I'm sure.

08:06.153 --> 08:09.523
Okay.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.659
If you made reservations
at the cafeteria,

08:11.692 --> 08:12.726
I'm gonna be so impressed.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.195
I called. They don't take 'em.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.666
Couldn't have grabbed a pencil?

08:18.699 --> 08:20.233
It's never enough, is it?

08:24.304 --> 08:27.074
I bet that fancy steak house
didn't serve egg salad

08:27.107 --> 08:28.876
with an ice cream scoop.

08:28.909 --> 08:32.813
Well, I think it'll pair
nicely with your Mr. Pibb.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.750
Hospital sushi.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.786
I see you have a taste
for adventure.
(laughs)

08:57.605 --> 08:59.640
And our five minutes
of peace are over.

08:59.673 --> 09:03.644
Don't mind me.
I'm not here to spy.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.846
I just had to get Marjorie
another tea.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.781
Oh, God, what did you say?

09:07.815 --> 09:11.318
I just asked hypothetically
if Victor died,

09:11.351 --> 09:14.087
did she think she would die
very quickly afterward?

09:14.121 --> 09:15.222
Seriously?

09:15.255 --> 09:16.657
Drop the eyebrow, missy.

09:16.690 --> 09:17.925
It's a thing, like penguins.

09:17.958 --> 09:21.829
Anyway, you kids have fun.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.276
Thank you for being
so understanding

09:36.309 --> 09:37.745
through all of this.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.947
No problem.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.815
Okay.

09:41.849 --> 09:45.585
Something really sexy is
about to happen right now.

09:47.755 --> 09:51.825
Oh, that, uh, salmon roll
tasted like a penny.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.628
Hmm.

09:54.662 --> 09:57.130
Would you like some
room-temperature egg salad?

09:57.164 --> 09:58.766
No, thanks.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.134
I'm really just here
for the company.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.737
Aw.

10:03.771 --> 10:07.708
So... can we go to a real
dinner tomorrow night?

10:07.741 --> 10:09.242
Well, I'd love to,
but I actually have

10:09.276 --> 10:11.044
to get back home tomorrow.

10:11.078 --> 10:14.381
Oh.

10:14.414 --> 10:17.651
Well, I... you know,
I-I knew that eventually

10:17.685 --> 10:21.121
you would have to get back,
but I'm gonna miss you.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.323
I'm gonna miss you, too,

10:23.356 --> 10:25.693
but it's not like
I live in Australia.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.762
That's true.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.965
Santa Cruz is only
a three-hour-and-
12-minute drive.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.771
I might have Googled us
door-to-door.

10:37.805 --> 10:40.774
Yeah. Did I give
you my address?

10:41.842 --> 10:44.745
Look, a lot of Googling
has gone on. I...

10:44.778 --> 10:46.413
Well, I'm in no
position to judge.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.248
I've Googled you, too.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.719
By the way, nice mug shot.

10:54.722 --> 10:57.157
Was my hair
in a ponytail or down?

10:57.190 --> 10:58.458
Uh, ponytail.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.428
Ah. Yeah, that's
the good one.
(chuckles)

11:01.461 --> 11:03.063
So, uh...

11:03.096 --> 11:07.334
do you think we should try
the long-distance thing?

11:07.367 --> 11:09.737
I'm game.

11:11.739 --> 11:14.374
But while I've
got you here...

11:19.847 --> 11:22.816
You do kind of taste
like a penny.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.891
There is literally
no way out of here.

11:31.959 --> 11:32.960
*

11:37.230 --> 11:39.366
(doorbell rings)

11:39.399 --> 11:41.068
Ten minutes, and
we're out of h...

11:41.101 --> 11:42.469
Hey!

11:42.502 --> 11:44.071
Is this a good time?

11:44.104 --> 11:45.839
Sure. Come on in.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.841
We know you've got
your hands full,

11:47.875 --> 11:49.009
so we brought you dinner.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.945
And a card, from everyone
at the Monday night meeting.

11:51.979 --> 11:55.415
Pardon my "happy birthday." I
didn't know what I was signing.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.985
Thank you for this.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.820
And for dinner--
I haven't been able

11:59.853 --> 12:02.022
to leave the house
since Victor came home.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.423
How's he doing?

12:03.456 --> 12:05.826
Sleeping now.
This is when I catch up

12:05.859 --> 12:08.361
on everything I can't do
when I'm with him.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.763
(sighs)

12:09.797 --> 12:11.531
So, how's it going
with you ladies?

12:11.564 --> 12:14.835
I could really use
something else to think about.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.838
Well, I know we're supposed
to keep it anonymous,

12:17.871 --> 12:21.108
but Rod Stewart came
to our meeting.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.509
It was not Rod Stewart.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.511
It was a woman
with a bad haircut

12:24.544 --> 12:26.113
and an English accent.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.448
And you just described
Rod Stewart.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.986
Christy, how's it going
with Patrick?

12:33.020 --> 12:35.856
(sighs):
Oh, we've been texting
the past couple weeks,

12:35.889 --> 12:37.557
but... it's hard.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.428
Well, one way or another,
love is always hard.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.563
Why are you pretending
to be a pharmacist

12:43.596 --> 12:45.799
from the 1850s?

12:45.833 --> 12:48.168
Because he's still
having trouble swallowing,

12:48.201 --> 12:51.271
so I have to crush up his meds
and give them to him

12:51.304 --> 12:54.174
through the tube in his stomach.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.343
(sighs)
It's gonna get better.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.145
I hope so.

12:58.178 --> 13:01.048
You need to get out
of here for a while.
(sighs)

13:01.081 --> 13:04.051
Yeah. A meeting
and a pedicure, stat.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.053
Boy, that sounds so good.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.587
I-I can't leave him.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.589
You have to take care
of yourself, too.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.892
Yeah, it's like that whole thing
on the airplane when you

13:11.925 --> 13:14.027
got to put your mask on first
before you put it on the kid.

13:14.061 --> 13:17.230
But you're supposed
to put it on me eventually.

13:17.264 --> 13:20.133
You made it to Orlando.
Let it go.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.836
Okay, here's the plan:

13:22.870 --> 13:25.238
you take Marjorie out,
I'll hold down the fort.

13:25.272 --> 13:28.608
Oh, boy. Maybe you're right,
I could use a change of scenery.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.310
Are you sure
you can handle Victor?

13:30.343 --> 13:31.945
Of course.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.046
Okay.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.614
He's-he's gonna wake up soon.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.084
These are
the doctor's instructions.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.052
Okay.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.254
Okay.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.056
Okay.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.392
Okay. You got this, Christy.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.096
*

13:50.630 --> 13:53.934
I can't believe you
left me there all afternoon.

13:53.967 --> 13:57.404
Hey. My day wasn't
exactly a picnic, either.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.509
You're seriously trying
to compare

14:02.542 --> 14:05.012
caring for a stroke victim
to a mani-pedi?

14:05.045 --> 14:07.514
Have you seen Marjorie's feet?

14:08.982 --> 14:12.085
I've never even seen her
in open-toed shoes.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.954
Well, there's a reason.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.155
Yikes.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.660
(sighs) This must be
so hard for her.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.630
One minute you're in love,
you've got a partner,

14:23.663 --> 14:26.233
and the next
you're caring for somebody

14:26.266 --> 14:28.268
who's completely helpless.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.437
It's so sad.

14:33.440 --> 14:37.444
She has one toenail that looks
like the roof of a shed.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.912
*

14:38.946 --> 14:40.413
(groans)

14:40.447 --> 14:43.050
I just want to take
a nice, hot Purell bath

14:43.083 --> 14:45.052
and look at those otters
holding hands on YouTube.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.420
Oh. My favorite part is
when they get separated,

14:47.454 --> 14:49.389
then they reach back
for each other.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.558
Right? They're making a choice.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.261
Hey.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.063
Oh, my God, Patrick!

14:56.096 --> 14:57.397
Hi.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.066
Hi. Mwah!

14:59.099 --> 15:01.034
Uh, what are you
doing here?

15:01.068 --> 15:03.270
Well, I realized something
I didn't like about Santa Cruz.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.339
Too many hippies?
Not enough hippies? What?

15:06.373 --> 15:07.340
You weren't there.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.977
Oh, what a cheeseball.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.712
Maybe, but I like it.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.214
(chuckles)

15:14.247 --> 15:15.482
You know, I wouldn't mind

15:15.515 --> 15:17.150
a little cheese
every now and then.

15:17.184 --> 15:21.321
Go away for two weeks--
let's see what happens.

15:21.354 --> 15:24.557
Hey, so, how about
I finally take you out
to that fancy dinner, huh?

15:24.591 --> 15:27.294
(exhales) Give me time
to take a shower

15:27.327 --> 15:28.561
and make myself pretty.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.064
Oh, well, you're already pretty.

15:32.199 --> 15:36.069
See? That right there,
be like that.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.704
*

15:37.737 --> 15:40.573
(music playing over TV)

15:40.607 --> 15:42.509
Hey.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.577
Hey. Didn't expect you
home tonight.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.047
Yeah. If you'd have been
ten minutes earlier,

15:47.080 --> 15:49.349
(laughs): you
would have seen...
(laughing)

15:49.382 --> 15:51.118
Anyway, welcome home.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.221
Would it kill you
to throw down a towel?

15:54.254 --> 15:57.590
Why aren't you back
at Patrick's hotel room

15:57.624 --> 16:00.093
throwing down your own towel?

16:01.128 --> 16:03.196
After dinner,
things got kind of awkward.

16:03.230 --> 16:06.233
Then he said he was tired
and dropped me off.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.634
What happened?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.202
It's not that big a deal.

16:09.236 --> 16:12.072
We were talking,
he asked me about my day,

16:12.105 --> 16:14.507
and I told him
about taking care of Victor.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.009
What's wrong with that?

16:16.043 --> 16:17.344
Then I mentioned

16:17.377 --> 16:19.746
that I could see myself
taking care of Patrick

16:19.779 --> 16:22.015
if he has a stroke
when he's old.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.350
Oh!
Yikes! What...?

16:23.383 --> 16:25.085
What is wrong with you?

16:25.118 --> 16:27.787
I thought you liked him.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.023
And I may have used
the word "diaper."

16:30.057 --> 16:31.758
Oh!
Oh, my God!

16:31.791 --> 16:33.626
But this is all
30 years from now!

16:33.660 --> 16:35.095
You said 30 years?

16:35.128 --> 16:37.264
Wow, I don't usually
think of you as stupid.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.568
We've been together two years,
and we're engaged,

16:41.601 --> 16:43.636
and we don't talk
about the future.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.805
Six hours in advance--
that's our max.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.641
Yeah. Watch. What are
we doing tomorrow night?

16:48.675 --> 16:51.211
I'll tell you tomorrow.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.314
Do you think I scared him?

16:54.347 --> 16:57.117
Like a clown in a sewer.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.718
Thanks, Mom.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.223
Our little girl's
gonna die alone.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.725
*

17:05.758 --> 17:07.294
(knocking)

17:11.331 --> 17:12.799
(laughs):
Hey.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.267
Hi.
Hi.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.303
I intercepted your
room service order.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.572
Uh, I didn't order anything,
so you better come in quick.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.174
Oh.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.845
(sighs)
Uh...

17:25.878 --> 17:28.448
So, you're probably
wondering why I'm here.

17:28.481 --> 17:31.684
Oh, you mean you didn't just
come by to steal some, uh--

17:31.718 --> 17:35.222
what is that?--
huevos rancheros?

17:35.255 --> 17:38.291
I just wanted to apologize
for last night.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.727
I was trying to tell
you about my day,

17:40.760 --> 17:43.230
and suddenly I was
30 years in the future

17:43.263 --> 17:45.832
and kind of dragging
you along with me.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.868
Well, I-I have to admit, it
did freak me out a little bit.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.304
I know. I'm so sorry.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.240
Well, you got
to understand, I'm just...

17:53.273 --> 17:54.741
getting out of
a long marriage,

17:54.774 --> 17:57.444
and I haven't been alone
since I was 19.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.179
I get it. I get it.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.114
Yeah.
You want to play
the field,

18:01.148 --> 18:02.615
you want to see
what's out there,

18:02.649 --> 18:06.253
you want to cross some things
off your sex bucket list.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.756
Uh, I don't know
what a sex bucket is,

18:09.789 --> 18:12.592
uh, but yeah, that was
basically the plan.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.262
And then I met you, and...

18:15.295 --> 18:17.264
(sighs) I guess
what really scares me

18:17.297 --> 18:20.200
is that you weren't the only one
thinking about the future.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.135
I wasn't?

18:22.169 --> 18:24.804
No. I mean, I mean, we...
haven't even slept together.

18:24.837 --> 18:28.341
Uh, I saw this
cute little beach house,

18:28.375 --> 18:30.143
and I thought to myself,

18:30.177 --> 18:32.279
"Maybe Christy and I
should live there."

18:32.312 --> 18:34.247
(chuckles)

18:34.281 --> 18:36.283
Wow.

18:36.316 --> 18:39.652
Your fantasy has
a beach house.

18:39.686 --> 18:42.789
Mine has you
in a diaper.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.492
Yeah, mine's better.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.428
Uh, but equally terrifying.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.402
You're as crazy as I am,

18:55.435 --> 18:58.438
and... that's
kind of reassuring.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.280
You know what?
I'd better go.

19:07.314 --> 19:10.283
I don't want to wreck
this relationship.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.117
Yeah. Me neither.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.687
Maybe we just should...
take it slow.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.424
Probably a good idea.
Yeah.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.494
Huh.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.931
Um...

19:24.964 --> 19:26.733
So, this beach house...

19:26.766 --> 19:29.336
is it big enough
for my mom and Adam?

19:29.369 --> 19:31.704
If there's a guest room,
I'll board it up.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.673
Oh, God, that's hot.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.342
(chuckles)

19:35.375 --> 19:36.576
Mmm.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.311
Um, all right.
All right.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.946
Okay, I'm gonna go, yes.
Yes. Okay.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.348
All right. I'll see you.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.219
Okay.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.187
Bye.
Bye.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.361
*

19:58.331 --> 19:59.466
Thanks for being here,
Bonnie, you're a big help.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.568
You're welcome.
And I want you to know

20:01.601 --> 20:02.969
I'm really working on saying

20:03.002 --> 20:04.837
appropriate things
when I'm here.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.839
Good for you.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.342
In fact,
I've even written some down

20:09.376 --> 20:11.711
that I think
are not only positive,

20:11.744 --> 20:14.213
but hopefully of some comfort.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.883
"Despite your
crushing exhaustion,

20:16.916 --> 20:18.851
you don't look that bad."

20:18.885 --> 20:20.720
Thank you.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.456
"Now you have a built-in excuse
to avoid unappealing events,

20:23.490 --> 20:25.925
like children's
birthday parties."

20:25.958 --> 20:28.261
I'll keep that in mind.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.463
Ah, here's a good one.
"I was at first frightened

20:30.497 --> 20:34.267
when I looked at Victor,
but now I am less so."

20:34.301 --> 20:36.736
You know what?
I'm just gonna focus

20:36.769 --> 20:39.406
on the fact that you cared
enough to write a list.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.873
I have four more.

20:40.907 --> 20:44.911
Just make me some tea.
Okay.
