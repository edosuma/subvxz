06:52.042 --> 06:55.415
AND IT WAS REALLY FAR AWAY,
AND EVERYBODY'S FINE, OKAY?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.987
EVERYBODY IS SAFE, ALL RIGHT?

06:56.987 --> 06:58.589
ALL RIGHT.

06:58.589 --> 07:00.451

07:00.451 --> 07:02.122
(Cam screaming)
GET HIM ON THE GROUND!

07:02.122 --> 07:03.994
(man) OVER HERE! PUT IT OUT!
I GUESS HE WENT OUT
FOR THAT SMOKE.

07:03.994 --> 07:12.463
(Owen) CALL THE BURN UNIT.
WE'RE GONNA NEED A GURNEY.

07:18.909 --> 07:21.912

LARGE-BORE I.V.

07:25.115 --> 07:26.747

07:28.519 --> 07:29.950

OKAY, LET'S ROLL.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.021

EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP.

07:31.021 --> 07:32.182
WE'RE GONNA BE RECEIVING
MORE PATIENTS.

07:32.182 --> 07:34.625
SO BUCKLE UP.
THIS IS GONNA BE A LONG DAY.

07:34.625 --> 07:36.056
(indistinct conversations)

07:36.056 --> 07:38.058
ELYSE CRUSE,
37 WEEKS PREGNANT,

07:38.058 --> 07:40.491
HYPOTENSIVE IN THE FIELD,
WITH ABDOMINAL BRUISING

07:40.491 --> 07:41.792
AND SECOND-DEGREE BURNS
ON HER RIGHT ARM.

07:41.792 --> 07:42.963
PAGE O.B.
(woman) RIGHT AWAY.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.665
I'M DR. KEPNER.
CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME?

07:44.665 --> 07:46.937
MY NAME'S ELYSE.
ELYSE CRUSE.

07:46.937 --> 07:48.639
OKAY, ELYSE--
BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT ME.

07:48.639 --> 07:51.642
PLEASE JUST DO WHATEVER
YOU CAN TO SAVE MY BABY.

07:51.642 --> 07:53.473
JUST SAVE MY LITTLE GIRL.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.875
HOW ABOUT I SAVE YOU BOTH?

07:54.875 --> 07:56.577
(cries) YEAH,
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

07:56.577 --> 07:57.808
OKAY.

07:57.808 --> 07:58.779
COULD YOU CALL MY HUSBAND?

07:58.779 --> 08:00.250
MM-HMM.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.752
OKAY, I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

08:01.752 --> 08:02.913
HEY.

08:02.913 --> 08:04.555
ARE YOU OKAY?

08:04.555 --> 08:05.716
YEAH.

08:05.716 --> 08:08.659
(indistinct conversations)

08:08.659 --> 08:10.791
(Rachel)
AND WHAT ABOUT MY SON?

08:10.791 --> 08:13.564
(Derek) We'll get an update
on your family soon, Rachel.

08:13.564 --> 08:15.766
(scanner whirring)

08:15.766 --> 08:17.728
WHAT'S THE WORD?

08:17.728 --> 08:19.269
GOOD NEWS IS, THE KID'S FINE.

08:19.269 --> 08:20.801
IT'S JUST A LITTLE CUT
THAT MURPHY CLEANED UP.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.002
MM-HMM.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.273
BAD NEWS IS, YANG HAS
THE HUSBAND IN SURGERY.

08:23.273 --> 08:27.107
POSSIBLY
AN AORTIC TRANSECTION.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.540
(beeping)
OH.

08:29.540 --> 08:30.711
SPEAKING OF BAD NEWS.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.813
UGH. RIGHT FRONTAL LOBE
HEMORRHAGE.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.885
THAT COULD BE WHY
SHE'S PERSEVERATING.

08:34.885 --> 08:37.287
OH, COOL.
IS THAT AN EPIDURAL HEMORRHAGE?

08:37.287 --> 08:38.849
SORRY.

08:38.849 --> 08:40.020
I'M INTERRUPTING.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.992
YOU GUYS WERE HAVING
A MOMENT OR SOMETHING.

08:41.992 --> 08:43.253
WHAT DO YOU WANT, BROOKS?

08:43.253 --> 08:45.525
WELL, CHIEF HUNT SAYS
I NEED TO LEARN BRAINY THINGS.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.558
SO I'M WITH YOU GUYS TODAY.

08:47.558 --> 08:49.029
(elevator bell dings)

08:49.029 --> 08:51.201
ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS
TO PALPATION.

08:51.201 --> 08:52.563
(monitor beeping erratically)

08:52.563 --> 08:53.734
DAMN IT.
SHE'S HAVING DECELS.

08:53.734 --> 08:54.765
HER B.P. IS DROPPING.

08:54.765 --> 08:56.006
OKAY, ELYSE, STAY WITH ME.
OKAY?

08:56.006 --> 08:57.237
JUST TRY TO STAY WITH ME.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.769
IS MY BABY OKAY?

08:58.769 --> 08:59.870
WE'RE GONNA ROLL YOU ON
YOUR SIDE RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

08:59.870 --> 09:01.141
YOU CAN'T HEAR
MY BABY'S HEART?

09:01.141 --> 09:02.573
TRY NOT TO WORRY.
(lowered voice) PAGE O.B. AGAIN.

09:02.573 --> 09:03.744
RIGHT NOW.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.045
(normal voice) UGH.
COME ON. COME ON.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.077
WHERE'S O.B.?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

09:07.077 --> 09:08.919
KEPNER, SHE'S BLEEDING.

09:08.919 --> 09:10.951
WHAT?

09:12.783 --> 09:14.084
(pants and groans)

09:14.084 --> 09:16.126
CORD'S PROLAPSED.
WE NEED TO SECURE IT.

09:16.126 --> 09:17.287
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

09:17.287 --> 09:18.789
YOUR BABY'S UMBILICAL CORD
HAS DROPPED,

09:18.789 --> 09:20.691
AND IT'S NOW TRAPPED
AGAINST HER BODY,

09:20.691 --> 09:21.962
AND THAT'S WHY
SHE'S IN DISTRESS.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.634
MA'AM, WE NEED TO KEEP
THE CORD INSIDE

09:23.634 --> 09:25.065
SO YOUR BABY DOESN'T LOSE
ANY MORE OXYGEN.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.097
TO DO THAT, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
PLACE MY HAND INSIDE.

09:27.097 --> 09:29.299
I'M REALLY SORRY, BUT IT'S
GONNA HURT A LOT, OKAY?

09:29.299 --> 09:31.201
DID YOU CALL MY HUSBAND?
WHERE IS MY HUSBAND?

09:31.201 --> 09:32.673
I DID. I CALLED HIM.
HOLD MY HAND.

09:32.673 --> 09:33.874
OKAY.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.646
OKAY?
OKAY.

09:35.646 --> 09:37.107
AAH! (crying)

09:37.107 --> 09:39.049
WE NEED TO GET THIS BABY OUT.
ALL RIGHT, WHERE'S O.B.?

09:39.049 --> 09:41.181
TELL THEM TO MEET US
IN THE O.R. NOW!
RIGHT AWAY.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.883
ELYSE, WE'RE GOING TO
SURGERY RIGHT NOW

09:42.883 --> 09:44.785
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU
AND YOUR BABY.

09:44.785 --> 09:45.756
OKAY?

09:45.756 --> 09:46.917
(continues crying)

09:46.917 --> 09:48.759
MATTHEW?

09:48.759 --> 09:50.060
MATTHEW?

09:50.060 --> 09:51.591
OH, HI.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.923
YEAH, SUPERMAN HERE
BROKE PROTOCOL...
WHAT?

09:52.923 --> 09:54.725
AND RAN INTO THE CRASH
TO SHIELD A KID FROM THE BLAST

09:54.725 --> 09:56.066
WITH HIS OWN BODY.

09:56.066 --> 09:57.668
WELL, IT SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT
THING TO DO AT THE TIME.

09:57.668 --> 09:58.829
HE COULD'VE DIED.

09:58.829 --> 10:00.600
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T.
I'M FI--OW.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.673
I'M FINE.

10:02.673 --> 10:03.774
JUST GO AHEAD AND GO.

10:03.774 --> 10:05.375
YOU GOT MORE IMPORTANT PATIENTS
THAN ME.

10:05.375 --> 10:07.778
GO SAVE A LIFE
OR SOMETHING.

10:07.778 --> 10:10.841
YEAH, GO AHEAD.
I'LL--I'LL CHECK HIM OUT.

10:10.841 --> 10:12.883
OKAY. UM, I-I WILL BE BACK
AS SOON AS I CAN.

10:12.883 --> 10:14.745
JUST--JUST DON'T GO CRAZY

10:14.745 --> 10:16.687
AND GO INTO SHOCK
OR BLEED OUT OR SOMETHING--

10:16.687 --> 10:18.719
APRIL, I'M FINE.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.390
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

10:20.390 --> 10:23.724
(sirens wailing)

10:23.724 --> 10:26.727
(indistinct conversations)

10:26.727 --> 10:30.200
PLEASE DON'T BE SURGICAL.
PLEASE DON'T BE SURGICAL.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.302
(groans)

10:32.302 --> 10:33.804
(woman) OKAY, I'M ON IT.

10:33.804 --> 10:35.736
OH, IT'S SURGICAL.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.337
HEY, THERE YOU ARE.
OH, NO. ME FIRST.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.809
OKAY, OKAY. WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

10:38.809 --> 10:40.140
YEAH, A BIKE MESSENGER
CAUGHT IN THE BLAST.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.812
MY PATIENT'S
IN A LOT OF PAIN.

10:41.812 --> 10:43.113
EVERYBODY'S PATIENT'S
IN A LOT OF PAIN.

10:43.113 --> 10:45.215
YEAH, THESE ARE ALL
GONNA NEED SURGERY.

10:45.215 --> 10:46.677
PAGE DR. GARRITY.

10:46.677 --> 10:48.278
MY PLANE LEAVES FOR--

10:48.278 --> 10:49.780
FOR TED IN FOUR HOURS.

10:49.780 --> 10:50.751
YOU'RE GOING TO TED?

10:50.751 --> 10:51.922
MM-HMM.

10:51.922 --> 10:53.383
LUCKY. MY ROOMMATE WENT
LAST YEAR.

10:53.383 --> 10:54.885
DID TEQUILA SHOTS
WITH BILL GATES.

10:54.885 --> 10:56.186
IT'S A FANCY PEOPLE
FRAT PARTY.

10:56.186 --> 10:58.658
OH, YOU'LL BE SINGING
A DIFFERENT TUNE NEXT YEAR

10:58.658 --> 11:00.090
WHEN YOU'RE THERE
WITH YOUR GENOME STUFF.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.362
OOH, MAP MY GENOMES.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.935
IT'S NOT A SPA TREATMENT.
IT'S SCIENCE.

11:04.935 --> 11:06.797
JUST LIKE BUILDING
NEW CARTILAGE.

11:06.797 --> 11:08.799
AS I SAY IN MY SPEECH--
OKAY, CALLIE.

11:08.799 --> 11:10.801
CALLIE. THE PATIENTS.

11:10.801 --> 11:12.302
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:12.302 --> 11:13.844
I SHOULD KEEP IT FRESH
FOR THE CONFERENCE ANYWAY.

11:13.844 --> 11:15.005
(chuckles)
EXCUSE ME.

11:15.005 --> 11:16.777
(indistinct conversations)

11:16.777 --> 11:19.780
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

11:21.381 --> 11:23.283
(door slides open)

11:23.283 --> 11:25.455
(Owen) UH, JUST LOOKING
FOR A STATUS REPORT

11:25.455 --> 11:26.787
FOR THE PATIENT'S KID.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.688
THE INJURY EXTENDS
INTO THE AORTIC ARCH.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.921
SO IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN
HEAD PERFUSION,

11:30.921 --> 11:33.093
I HAVE TO BYPASS
IN TWO CIRCUITS.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.965
I'M JUST WAITING ON RUSSELL
FOR A SECOND OPINION.

11:34.965 --> 11:36.767
YOU HAD TO CALL RUSSELL
FOR THIS?

11:36.767 --> 11:37.798
NOT REALLY.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.469
BUT EVER SINCE
I BECAME HIS BOSS,

11:39.469 --> 11:41.471
I LIKE TO MAKE HIM THINK
THAT HE'S STILL MINE.

11:41.471 --> 11:43.273
3-0 PROLENE.
(instrument clatters)

11:43.273 --> 11:45.936
SO COULD I GIVE THE KID
A TIME FRAME?

11:45.936 --> 11:47.808
UH, GIVE ME AN HOUR.
I'LL KNOW BETTER.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.709
OKAY.

13:02.512 --> 13:04.184
I WAS ON MY WAY

13:04.184 --> 13:05.916

13:12.522 --> 13:14.194
(monitor beeping erratically)

OH, GOD, ELYSE.
SHE'S LOSING TOO MUCH BLOOD.

13:16.827 --> 13:18.869
MORE LAP PADS. NOW!

13:24.374 --> 13:25.976
(siren wails, horns honk)

13:25.976 --> 13:27.577
(indistinct conversations)

13:27.577 --> 13:28.939
BURN CENTER IS FULL.

13:28.939 --> 13:30.080
I JUST CLOSED US
TO NEW PATIENTS. WHAT ELSE?

13:30.080 --> 13:31.241
SOCIAL SERVICES
CAME FOR THE LITTLE BOY--

13:31.241 --> 13:32.913
(woman) ETHAN! NO!

13:32.913 --> 13:34.915
WHOA. WHOA. WHOA.
WHERE YOU GOING?

13:34.915 --> 13:36.116
I WANT TO SEE MY PARENTS.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.518
SORRY. HE'S A RUNNER.
HONEY, WE NEED TO GO.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.450
NO, I DON'T WANT TO.
YOU NEED SLEEP.

13:40.450 --> 13:41.892
NO,
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

13:41.892 --> 13:44.294
YES, YOU ARE. YOU'RE COMING
WITH ME. NOW COME.

13:44.294 --> 13:45.595
NO.
LOOK, HE'S WORRIED
ABOUT HIS PARENTS.

13:45.595 --> 13:47.928
HOW ABOUT WE SET YOU UP
IN A ROOM,

13:47.928 --> 13:49.229
AND YOU CAN STAY
WITH HIM THERE?

13:49.229 --> 13:50.931
THAT'S NOT
A PERMANENT SOLUTION.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.132
I KNOW, BUT IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S FOR ONE NIGHT.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.164
AND THEN WE CAN FIGURE OUT
THE REST LATER.

13:54.164 --> 13:55.835
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.167
YEAH? SOUND GOOD?

13:57.167 --> 13:58.939
OKAY.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.611
COME ON. WE NEED TO GO NOW.

14:01.611 --> 14:03.613
(babies fussing)

14:03.613 --> 14:05.615
THE BABY'S DAD JUST ARRIVED.

14:05.615 --> 14:07.147
MYERS IS BRINGING HIM UP.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.848
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT
SHE SEES IN THAT D-BAG.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.280
RIGHT? WHAT DOES SHE SEE
IN THAT GUY?

14:10.280 --> 14:11.851
HE'S SO HANDSOME

14:11.851 --> 14:13.283
AND FRIENDLY,

14:13.283 --> 14:15.225
CHARMING, NICE.

14:15.225 --> 14:16.556
(door opens)

14:16.556 --> 14:18.128
(fussing continues)

14:18.128 --> 14:20.190
VINCE, THIS IS DR. KAREV.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.993
HE'S BEEN TAKING CARE
OF YOUR LITTLE GIRL.

14:22.993 --> 14:25.595
LOOK AT HER.
SHE--SHE'S PERFECT.

14:25.595 --> 14:27.867
SHE'S DOING REALLY WELL.
AND I SPOKE TO DR. KEPNER.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.340
YOUR WIFE IS STILL IN SURGERY.
WE SHOULD HAVE AN UPDATE SOON.

14:30.340 --> 14:32.272
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.944
YOUR BABY'S
PRETTY DARN CUTE.

14:33.944 --> 14:35.045
WANT TO HOLD HER?

14:35.045 --> 14:36.376
(fussing continues)

14:36.376 --> 14:38.578
(coos)

14:42.012 --> 14:44.654
(lowered voice)
ALSO SENSITIVE.

14:44.654 --> 14:47.317
DID I MENTION,
HE'S SENSITIVE?

14:51.061 --> 14:52.662
(fussing continues)

14:52.662 --> 14:54.224
WE WENT HOME,
BUT THEN HIS FEVER GOT HIGHER.

14:54.224 --> 14:55.495
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.626
MA'AM, WE'LL BE WITH YOU
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

14:56.626 --> 14:58.028
WE'RE EXTREMELY BACKED UP.

14:58.028 --> 14:59.199
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND
EVERYONE'S VERY SICK,

14:59.199 --> 15:00.570
BUT SO IS MY SON.

15:00.570 --> 15:01.932
CASEY, WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK HERE?

15:01.932 --> 15:03.273
THIS ISN'T STREP.

15:03.273 --> 15:04.904
WHATEVER YOU PRESCRIBED HIM
DID NOTHING.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.377
IT TAKES AT LEAST 24 HOURS FOR
ANTIBIOTICS TO START WORKING.

15:07.377 --> 15:08.908
YEAH, BUT THEN HE SHOULD
BE GETTING BETTER,

15:08.908 --> 15:10.210
AND HE'S GETTING WORSE.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.212
THIS ISN'T STREP.
PLEASE JUST CALM DOWN.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.644
CALM DOWN? CALM DOWN?
MY SON IS SICK.

15:14.644 --> 15:16.987
HE'S SICK,
AND YOU GAVE HIM MEDICINE,

15:16.987 --> 15:18.388
AND IT'S NOT WORKING.

15:18.388 --> 15:19.919
AND NOW YOU JUST KEEP
DISMISSING US,

15:19.919 --> 15:21.591
JUST LIKE
ALL THE OTHER DOCTORS DID

15:21.591 --> 15:22.953
AT SEATTLE PRES
AND URGENT CARE--

15:22.953 --> 15:24.294
WAIT. HANG ON.

15:24.294 --> 15:27.027
YOU'VE BEEN TO BOTH OF
THOSE PLACES, TOO, THIS WEEK?

15:27.027 --> 15:28.658
YEAH, AND I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
PUSH ME AROUND LIKE THEY DID.

15:28.658 --> 15:30.460
YOU EITHER DON'T CARE
ABOUT MY SON

15:30.460 --> 15:32.002
OR YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

15:32.002 --> 15:34.234
EITHER WAY, YOU SUCK,
AND I WANT SOMEONE ELSE.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.966
FIND ME ANOTHER DOCTOR!

15:35.966 --> 15:37.567
KEEP AN EYE ON RACHEL'S I.C.P.

15:37.567 --> 15:38.708
UPDATE ME WITH ANY CHANGES.

15:38.708 --> 15:40.440
WILL DO.
ANYTHING ELSE?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.612
YES, BROOKS, THINK FAST.

15:42.612 --> 15:44.374
ANYTHING ELSE MEDICALLY?

15:44.374 --> 15:46.046
A NEURO EXAM EVERY TWO HOURS.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.377
CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY
IF THERE'S ANY SIGN

15:47.377 --> 15:49.249
OF HERNIATION
OR A NEW HEMORRHAGE.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.420
YOU GOT IT?

15:50.420 --> 15:52.622
YES, SIR.
GOOD.

15:52.622 --> 15:54.254
DR. SHEPHERD,
I'M OPEN.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.286
(clatters)

15:56.286 --> 15:58.989
(elevator bell dings)

16:01.031 --> 16:03.233
THAT WAS MY PHONE.

16:05.135 --> 16:08.598
I'M SORRY YOU HAVE TO
STAND THERE FOR SO LONG,

16:08.598 --> 16:10.440
DEALING WITH MY ASS.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.572
AH, IT'S FINE.
I'M A PLASTIC SURGEON.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.044
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL
TO ME.

16:14.044 --> 16:15.675
ACTUALLY, CAN WE NOT TALK
WHILE YOU DO THAT?

16:15.675 --> 16:18.748
SURE.
I FEEL FOR YOU, DUDE.

16:18.748 --> 16:20.610
BUT I HAVE SEEN WAY WORSE.

16:20.610 --> 16:22.712
OKAY. I'M GONNA
COME BACK LATER.

16:22.712 --> 16:24.254
APRIL--

16:24.254 --> 16:25.585
IT'S COOL. I'M, UH,
I'M JUST GONNA--

16:25.585 --> 16:27.457
I'M GONNA LEAVE NOW.
YEP. NOW.

16:27.457 --> 16:28.988
LIKE THAT.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.161
THAT WAS WORSE.

16:31.161 --> 16:33.623
(Casey) HE'S CRANKY,
HE'S NOT SLEEPING WELL,

16:33.623 --> 16:35.125
AND THEN HE'S GOT
THESE REALLY CHAPPED LIPS,

16:35.125 --> 16:36.996
AND THEN TODAY
IT WAS THIS WEIRD RASH.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.728
A-AND--AND HOW--
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

16:38.728 --> 16:41.501
ARE YOU GETTING
ENOUGH SLEEP?

16:41.501 --> 16:44.003
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I TOLD YOU, HE'S UP ALL NIGHT.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.005
AND IT'S JUST YOU,
NO HUSBAND,

16:46.005 --> 16:47.437
NO BOYFRIEND, OR PARTNER?

16:47.437 --> 16:48.638
IT'S JUST ME.

16:48.638 --> 16:51.010
WELL, THAT'S A LOT
OF PRESSURE ON YOU.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.212
ARE YOU A PSYCHIATRIST?

16:52.212 --> 16:53.543
CASEY,

16:53.543 --> 16:55.115
JUST LISTEN--

16:55.115 --> 16:57.687
OH, MY GOD. YOU ARE.

16:57.687 --> 16:59.689
YOU THINK I'M CRAZY.

16:59.689 --> 17:01.651
YOU THINK I-I SKIP WORK

17:01.651 --> 17:04.054
AND I DRAG MY KID TO THE E.R.
BECAUSE IT'S FUN,

17:04.054 --> 17:06.326
BECAUSE--BECAUSE I ENJOY THIS?

17:06.326 --> 17:08.658
MY SON IS SICK, OKAY?
HE IS SICK.

17:08.658 --> 17:10.360
HE USED TO WAKE ME UP
EVERY MORNING AT DAWN

17:10.360 --> 17:11.701
BY JUMPING ON MY BED.

17:11.701 --> 17:13.703
(voice breaking)
NOW I CAN BARELY GET HIM UP.

17:13.703 --> 17:15.205
HE DOES
THIS THING BEFORE SCHOOL--

17:15.205 --> 17:17.337
I LET HIM RUN OUT
AND GET THE NEWSPAPER--

17:17.337 --> 17:19.739
IT'S HIS BIG-KID CHORE.
HE LOVES IT.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.571
HE HASN'T DONE IT
IN A WEEK AND A HALF.

17:21.571 --> 17:23.413
I SHOW HIM CARTOONS,
AND HE DOESN'T CARE.

17:23.413 --> 17:24.744
I TRY TO GET HIM TO EAT...

17:24.744 --> 17:26.716
I MEAN, I EVEN GAVE HIM
POTATO CHIPS FOR BREAKFAST ONCE,

17:26.716 --> 17:29.419
AND... NOTHING.

17:29.419 --> 17:31.651
I KNOW...

17:31.651 --> 17:33.823
THAT I AM NOT A DOCTOR,
BUT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

17:33.823 --> 17:35.655
YOU HAVE TO. YOU HAVE TO.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.557
HEY. HEY, HEY, HEY.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.529
I BELIEVE YOU.

17:39.529 --> 17:41.731
WE'RE GONNA TAKE CARE
OF YOUR SON.

17:41.731 --> 17:42.832
ADMIT HIM.

17:42.832 --> 17:44.234
I BELIEVE YOU.

17:44.234 --> 17:46.196
(cries)

17:47.467 --> 17:49.669
YES, I ALERTED SECURITY.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.701
OF COURSE.
I LOOKED ALL OVER.

17:51.701 --> 17:52.702
WHERE'S ETHAN?

17:52.702 --> 17:54.474
HANG ON. I DON'T KNOW.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.476
I WENT TO THE RESTROOM.
WHEN I CAME BACK, HE WAS GONE.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.678
WHEN?
I TOLD YOU, HE'S A RUNNER.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.410
WHEN DID YOU LOSE HIM?
ABOUT A HALF-HOUR AGO.

18:00.410 --> 18:02.752
(siren wailing)

18:02.752 --> 18:04.114
YEAH.

18:13.863 --> 18:17.567
(woman speaking indistinctly)

18:17.567 --> 18:20.570
(indistinct conversations)

18:23.273 --> 18:25.275
(Heather)
NO, SHEPHERD STILL HATES ME.

18:25.275 --> 18:27.277
NOW HE JUST MAKES ME
DO TRICKS.

18:27.277 --> 18:29.279
IT TAKES MORE THAN JUST
GOOD INSTINCTS WITH SHEPHERD.

18:29.279 --> 18:31.441
YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED,
DILIGENT--

18:31.441 --> 18:33.243
SAYS HIS STAR PUPIL.
I'M HIS CIRCUS ACT.

18:33.243 --> 18:34.414
WAIT.
MOM.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.645
HANG ON, BUDDY.
MOM.

18:35.645 --> 18:37.517
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:37.517 --> 18:38.748
WHO ARE YOU? WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:38.748 --> 18:40.750
WHY DON'T WE GO OUTSIDE,
OKAY?

18:40.750 --> 18:42.722
IT'S ME, MOM. ETHAN.

18:42.722 --> 18:43.893
IT'S OKAY, MA'AM.
ETHAN.

18:43.893 --> 18:45.255
IT'S YOUR SON.

18:45.255 --> 18:47.197
NO, IT'S NOT. WHO IS HE?
WHO IS THAT?!

18:47.197 --> 18:48.758
WHO ARE YOU?!

18:48.758 --> 18:50.760
HELP ME! WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

18:50.760 --> 18:53.203
WHO IS THIS? (sobs)
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

18:53.203 --> 18:55.435
HELP ME! HELP ME, PLEASE!

19:02.842 --> 19:04.574
SO YOU'RE
IN THE SEMIFINALS, HUH?

19:04.574 --> 19:06.676
WHAT POSITION DO YOU PLAY?

19:06.676 --> 19:09.219
COACH STUCK ME
AT LEFT DEFENDER.

19:09.219 --> 19:12.582
HEY, LEFT DEFENDER...
IS CRUCIAL.

19:12.582 --> 19:14.924
I GUESS.

19:14.924 --> 19:16.626
SO...

19:16.626 --> 19:19.259
WHY DOESN'T SHE KNOW
WHO I AM?

19:19.259 --> 19:22.762
ETHAN, YOUR MOM
HURT HER HEAD PRETTY BAD.

19:22.762 --> 19:27.367
AND SOMETIMES THAT CAN
MAKE PEOPLE ACT REALLY WEIRD,

19:27.367 --> 19:28.838
EVEN WITH THE PEOPLE
THAT THEY LOVE.

19:28.838 --> 19:31.901
SO SHE'S GONNA REMEMBER ME?

19:31.901 --> 19:33.843
I THINK SO.

19:33.843 --> 19:36.876
(cell phone chimes)

19:36.876 --> 19:38.778
E-ETHAN, I, UM...

19:38.778 --> 19:41.511
I NEED YOU TO STAY
WITH THE SOCIAL WORKER.

19:41.511 --> 19:43.413
THE LADY?
MM-HMM.

19:43.413 --> 19:44.754
CAN I STAY WITH YOU?

19:44.754 --> 19:46.856
(laughs) NO, NO. NO,
I HAVE TO--I HAVE TO WORK.

19:46.856 --> 19:48.358
I HAVE TO HELP YOUR MOM
AND DAD GET BETTER,

19:48.358 --> 19:50.260
AND THEY'RE--THEY'RE GONNA
GET BETTER QUICKER

19:50.260 --> 19:52.191
IF THEY KNOW
THAT YOU'RE SOMEWHERE SAFE.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.793
SO CAN YOU HELP ME OUT
WITH THAT?

19:55.625 --> 19:57.767
YOU DONE?

19:57.767 --> 19:59.699
(groans)

19:59.699 --> 20:02.502
AND I'M TELLING YOU...

20:02.502 --> 20:04.504
THE GUYS BRING THE BALL
DOWN THE WINGS,

20:04.504 --> 20:06.876
LEFT DEFENDER
CAN SAVE THE GAME.

20:06.876 --> 20:08.878
SHE HAS A NEW HEMATOMA
IN THE TEMPORAL LOBE.

20:08.878 --> 20:11.711
NOW WHY WOULD THAT CAUSE HER
NOT TO RECOGNIZE HER SON?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.613
UH, THE HEMATOMA COULD BE
PUTTING PRESSURE

20:13.613 --> 20:15.285
ON THE WHITE MATTER TRACTS,

20:15.285 --> 20:17.287
CAUSING HER TO EXPERIENCE
SYMPTOMS OF CAPGRAS SYNDROME.

20:17.287 --> 20:18.718
GOOD. AND WHAT WOULD
YOUR PLAN OF ACTION BE?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.720
RELIEVE THE PRESSURE WITH
EVACUATION OF THE HEMATOMA.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.552
WHAT ABOUT WATCHING
HER COAGS

20:22.552 --> 20:24.654
AND CORRECTING HER I.C.P.
WITH MANNITOL

20:24.654 --> 20:26.326
AND AGGRESSIVE
I.C.P. DRAINAGE?

20:26.326 --> 20:27.657
THAT'S A GOOD THOUGHT,
BROOKS,

20:27.657 --> 20:29.829
BUT IN THIS CASE,
I THINK ROSS IS RIGHT.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.761
UH, FIND AN O.R.
THAT'S AVAILABLE. OKAY?

20:31.761 --> 20:32.962
OH, BROOKS.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.937
YOU NEVER MISS, DO YOU?

20:39.609 --> 20:42.542
(door opens)

20:42.542 --> 20:43.843
STAR PUPIL.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.745
CIRCUS ACT.

20:45.745 --> 20:49.479
HIS CAT SCAN
IS COMPLETELY NORMAL.

20:49.479 --> 20:51.751
I KNOW THIS MUST BE
SO ANNOYING FOR YOU.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.523
I MEAN, I KNOW
I KNOW NOTHING,

20:53.523 --> 20:54.854
BUT I DID ALL THIS RESEARCH--

20:54.854 --> 20:57.026
NO, NOT AT ALL.
LET'S GO THROUGH IT.

20:57.026 --> 20:58.388
PLEASE.
UM...

20:58.388 --> 20:59.589
WHAT'S FIRST?

20:59.589 --> 21:01.861
OKAY, ARE YOU SURE
THAT IT'S NOT LUPUS?

21:01.861 --> 21:03.293
HE DOESN'T FIT THE CRITERIA,

21:03.293 --> 21:04.864
AND THE RASH
IS QUITE DIFFERENT.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.836
WHAT ELSE?

21:06.836 --> 21:08.838
WHAT ABOUT, UH,
ENT-ENTEROVIRUS

21:08.838 --> 21:10.800
OR, UM, MENINGITIS?

21:10.800 --> 21:12.802
WELL, I CAN SEE WHY
YOU WOULD THINK THAT,

21:12.802 --> 21:15.805
BUT AGAIN, THE RASH
ASSOCIATED WITH ENTEROVIRUS

21:15.805 --> 21:18.708
IS COMMONLY DISTRIBUTED OVER
THE HANDS AND THE FEET.
(whimpers)

21:18.708 --> 21:20.750
AND, UH,
WE RULED OUT MENINGITIS

21:20.750 --> 21:22.852
WHEN HIS SPINAL TAP
CAME BACK CLEAR.

21:22.852 --> 21:24.884
OKAY. UM...

21:24.884 --> 21:26.716
I READ THIS ONE ARTICLE

21:26.716 --> 21:28.788
ABOUT SOMETHING
CALLED KAWASAKI DISEASE.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.890
THEY SAID IT CAN CAUSE
A HEART ATTACK.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.722
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

21:32.722 --> 21:34.924
IT WOULD EXPLAIN
THE FEVER AND THE RASH.

21:34.924 --> 21:37.827
BUT THERE WOULD BE
OTHER SYMPTOMS--

21:37.827 --> 21:39.329
THE STRAWBERRY TONGUE

21:39.329 --> 21:41.631
AND PEELING SKIN
AND RED EYES

21:41.631 --> 21:43.873
AND--AND NO POSITIVE STREP.

21:43.873 --> 21:48.378
DR. GREY...
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS?

21:48.378 --> 21:49.879
I-I THINK IT'S STREP.

21:49.879 --> 21:52.512
YEAH, BUT THEN HE WOULD
BE GETTING BETTER.

21:52.512 --> 21:53.983
I'M SORRY. I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE A SURGEON.

21:53.983 --> 21:56.085
YOU DON'T EVEN NORMALLY
HANDLE CASES LIKE THIS.

21:56.085 --> 21:58.648
NO, IT'S, UH...

22:01.751 --> 22:03.753
I OWN THE HOSPITAL,
AND I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.

22:03.753 --> 22:06.626
I WANT TO DO SOME MORE TESTS.

22:07.757 --> 22:12.061
(Vince) YOU AND ME, ELYSE,
WE'RE A TEAM.

22:12.061 --> 22:14.033
EVER SINCE PROFESSOR SHELDON

22:14.033 --> 22:16.366
PAIRED US UP IN THAT
STUPID POLI-SCI CLASS.

22:18.908 --> 22:21.110
I DON'T WORK WITHOUT YOU.

22:21.110 --> 22:23.813
SO YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME
OR US.

22:25.074 --> 22:27.547
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE TOGETHER.

22:37.457 --> 22:40.690
ELYSE LIKES THE NAME ROSE
FOR THE BABY.

22:40.690 --> 22:42.992
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

22:42.992 --> 22:44.864
I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.537
OKAY, HONEY.

22:47.537 --> 22:50.139
ROSIE IT IS.

22:50.139 --> 22:54.404
I'M GONNA GO DOWN
AND SEE HER.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.776
I LOVE YOU.

23:09.559 --> 23:11.020
I'M JUST GONNA
CHECK ON HER BURNS.

23:11.020 --> 23:12.922
HOW'S SHE DOING?

23:12.922 --> 23:14.794
(sighs) NOT WELL.

23:14.794 --> 23:18.528
SHE'S ACIDOTIC,
AND HER CREATININE'S SKY-HIGH.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.971
YOU KNOW,
THEY DATED IN COLLEGE.

23:21.971 --> 23:23.773
BUT THEN HER DAD DIED,

23:23.773 --> 23:25.074
SO SHE HAD TO LEAVE SCHOOL,
AND THEY LOST TOUCH

23:25.074 --> 23:26.906
TILL ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO,

23:26.906 --> 23:28.978
WHEN THEY BOTH RANDOMLY
DECIDED TO MOVE

23:28.978 --> 23:30.680
FROM WISCONSIN TO SEATTLE

23:30.680 --> 23:34.113
AND JOINED
THE SAME BOWLING LEAGUE.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.085
HOW WEIRD IS THAT?

23:36.085 --> 23:38.087
THAT PEOPLE
JOIN BOWLING LEAGUES?

23:40.850 --> 23:44.454
THE UNIVERSE KEPT
PULLING THEM TOGETHER, JUST...

23:44.454 --> 23:47.927
WAITING FOR THEM TO SEE THAT
THEY WERE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER,

23:47.927 --> 23:49.659
AND THEN...

23:51.531 --> 23:53.933
AND THEN A TANKER EXPLODES,

23:53.933 --> 23:56.706
AND SHE ENDS UP
IN THE HOSPITAL.

23:56.706 --> 23:58.107
YEAH.

23:58.107 --> 23:59.739
(sighs)

23:59.739 --> 24:04.614

24:08.778 --> 24:10.850
YOU HAVE TO MAP ME.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.582
I NEED TO KNOW WHICH PARENT
I TAKE AFTER.

24:12.582 --> 24:15.184
MY DAD EATS THREE SALADS
A DAY AND HAS HIGH CHOLESTEROL.

24:15.184 --> 24:16.926

24:16.926 --> 24:18.057

I GET MAPPED.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.730
HEY, MY GENOME SEQUENCER
IS NOT A TOY.

24:20.730 --> 24:22.692

24:22.692 --> 24:24.133

PIECE OF EQUIPMENT,

24:24.133 --> 24:26.936

WITH SERIOUS CONDITIONS.

24:26.936 --> 24:28.638

ON FIRE

24:41.811 --> 24:43.813

AN ORTHO CONSULT,

24:44.984 --> 24:46.516

24:46.516 --> 24:47.817

TO LEAVE HOURS AGO?

24:47.817 --> 24:50.760
I WAS, BUT THEN...
BAKED ALASKA.

24:50.760 --> 24:53.523
(sighs) I'M SO SORRY.

24:53.523 --> 24:55.995
WELL, HEY,
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.097
NOW YOU HAVE TIME TO SPICE UP
YOUR SPEECH FOR NEXT YEAR.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.930
(chuckles) AND I STILL NEED
AN ORTHO CONSULT

25:00.930 --> 25:02.632
IN O.R. THREE
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

25:02.632 --> 25:03.973
(chuckles) SPICE--
SPICE UP?

25:03.973 --> 25:05.905
NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.276

25:07.276 --> 25:09.238
NO, NO. I'M JUST SAYING

I-I HEARD ONE ABOUT
FLOATING ALGAE PODS,

REMINDING ME

25:17.647 --> 25:19.088

TO THE FULLEST.

25:19.088 --> 25:20.249
UH-HUH.

25:20.249 --> 25:21.821

25:21.821 --> 25:24.854

25:35.835 --> 25:38.137

25:39.909 --> 25:41.941

REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.073

31:55.945 --> 32:00.019
(crying)

32:01.350 --> 32:05.324
HEY,
YOU SEEN SUPER DOUCHE AROUND?

32:05.324 --> 32:07.396
PECKWELL?

32:07.396 --> 32:08.557
JASON?

32:08.557 --> 32:09.698
AH, CONFERENCE ROOM.

32:09.698 --> 32:12.701
(indistinct conversations)

32:14.463 --> 32:16.635
MYERS.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.270
(smart phone chimes)

32:21.270 --> 32:24.443
OH, GREY'S PAGING ME.
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER. HEY.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.615
VINCE CRUSE'S WIFE
DIDN'T MAKE IT.

32:26.615 --> 32:28.677
I FIGURE THE NEWS
MIGHT COME BETTER FROM YOU.

32:28.677 --> 32:31.020
I'M SORRY.
SHE'S NOT MY PATIENT ANYMORE.

32:31.020 --> 32:32.451
I PASSED HER OFF
TO KEPNER.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.683
OKAY, BUT HIS WIFE WAS YOUR
PATIENT WHEN SHE FIRST CAME IN.

32:34.683 --> 32:36.986
THE GUY KNOWS YOU.
HE TRUSTS YOU.

32:36.986 --> 32:40.159
DUDE, I'M SORRY, BUT SHE
IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY.

32:40.159 --> 32:41.660
YOU'RE A DOUCHE.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.062
NO, YOU'RE A DOUCHE.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.433
YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH HOW I DO MY JOB.

32:44.433 --> 32:46.095
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH WHO I'M DATING.

32:46.095 --> 32:48.067
YOU'RE REALLY NOT COMING
WITH ME TO TALK TO HIM?

32:48.067 --> 32:50.069
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

32:50.069 --> 32:53.072
GUESS I'LL BE DOING
YOUR JOB AGAIN.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.743
(woman) DR. LEON,
CALL THE BLOOD BANK.

32:54.743 --> 32:57.206
(exhales) YOU PAGED ME?

32:57.206 --> 32:59.078
OH,
WE'RE DISCHARGING PARKER?

32:59.078 --> 33:00.409
YES, I HAVE IT ALL READY
TO GO,

33:00.409 --> 33:02.081
BUT I JUST NEED YOU TO GO
THROUGH IT WITH ME ALL

33:02.081 --> 33:03.052
ONE MORE TIME.

33:03.052 --> 33:04.213
OKAY.

33:04.213 --> 33:05.554
LATEST WHITE COUNT?
18.

33:05.554 --> 33:06.755
PLATELET COUNT?

33:06.755 --> 33:07.756
500,000.

33:07.756 --> 33:11.090
HIGH FEVER.
UNRESPONSIVE TO MEDS.

33:11.090 --> 33:14.363
IT'S GOTTA JUST BE A WEIRD
PRESENTATION OF STREP, RIGHT?

33:14.363 --> 33:15.594
(tablet dings)

33:15.594 --> 33:17.226
ACTUALLY, HANG ON.
THE LABS WERE JUST UPDATED.

33:17.226 --> 33:20.029
YESTERDAY'S RAPID TEST
WAS A FALSE POSITIVE.

33:20.029 --> 33:23.302
THE STREP CULTURE'S NEGATIVE.

33:23.302 --> 33:24.633
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

33:24.633 --> 33:25.774
NO ONE.
I'M CHECKING MY CALENDAR.

33:25.774 --> 33:27.676
WHAT DAY DID HIS FEVER START?

33:27.676 --> 33:29.408
WEDNESDAY, I THINK.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.009
DAMN.
WE'RE ALREADY AT DAY TEN.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.741
WHAT'S DAY TEN?
DID PARKER HAVE RED EYES?

33:32.741 --> 33:34.743
UH, HE WAS ASLEEP THE LAST TIME
I CHECKED ON HIM.

33:34.743 --> 33:36.145
(Meredith) LET'S GO.

33:36.145 --> 33:39.688
(indistinct conversations)

33:39.688 --> 33:41.220
OH.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

33:41.220 --> 33:42.721
WE NEED TO CHECK
PARKER'S EYES.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.094
WHAT--WHAT'S GOING ON?
Y-YOU'RE SCARING ME.

33:45.094 --> 33:47.696
PAGE PEDS, PAGE CARDIO,
START AN I.V.I.G. RIGHT AWAY.

33:47.696 --> 33:48.727
WE'RE ALREADY ON DAY TEN.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.099
WHAT? WHAT IS HAPPENING?

33:50.099 --> 33:51.430
CASEY, IF WE'RE RIGHT,

33:51.430 --> 33:53.262
THIS COULD BE
KAWASAKI DISEASE.

33:53.262 --> 33:55.134
BUT WE NEED TO GET THIS I.V.
STARTED ON PARKER RIGHT AWAY.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.465
WE'RE STILL WITHIN THE WINDOW

33:56.465 --> 33:58.036
TO PREVENT
PERMANENT HEART DAMAGE,

33:58.036 --> 33:59.338
BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT
RIGHT NOW.

33:59.338 --> 34:07.276
(cries and sniffles)

34:15.824 --> 34:17.756
OH, NO.

34:17.756 --> 34:20.589
(cries) NO. NO.

34:29.738 --> 34:32.741
(exhales)

34:32.741 --> 34:34.803
(door opens)

34:34.803 --> 34:37.406
(crying)

34:39.478 --> 34:42.481
(crying)

34:44.113 --> 34:47.516
CASEY, HEY.
HEY.

34:47.516 --> 34:48.687
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.

34:48.687 --> 34:49.858
OKAY.

34:49.858 --> 34:51.820
SO THIS IS PARKER'S ECHO.

34:51.820 --> 34:53.292
(heart beating)

34:53.292 --> 34:56.395
THAT RIGHT THERE IS
THE FLUID AROUND HIS HEART.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.096
THE I.V.I.G. WILL FIX THAT.
(sniffles)

34:58.096 --> 35:01.200
HE'S GONNA NEED ANOTHER ECHO
IN SIX MONTHS.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.832
(rustles paper)
AND... DO YOU REMEMBER THIS?

35:03.832 --> 35:05.574
MM.

35:05.574 --> 35:08.377
PARKER HAS KAWASAKI DISEASE.

35:08.377 --> 35:09.778
YOU FOUGHT FOR YOUR SON.

35:09.778 --> 35:11.810
(exhales)
YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.682
YOU SAVED HIS LIFE TODAY.

35:13.682 --> 35:15.184
YOU WERE RIGHT.

35:15.184 --> 35:16.515
I WAS RIGHT?

35:16.515 --> 35:17.686
YOU WERE RIGHT.

35:17.686 --> 35:20.789
(sobs)

35:20.789 --> 35:22.891
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

35:22.891 --> 35:24.353
(exhales)

35:24.353 --> 35:26.425
DR. SHEPHERD, I'VE RUN
A FULL POST-OP EXAM ON RACHEL.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.656
MM-HMM.

35:27.656 --> 35:28.797
I'M GONNA MONITOR HER
FOR THE NEXT FOUR HOURS,

35:28.797 --> 35:30.159
BUT DON'T WORRY.

35:30.159 --> 35:31.330
I'LL STILL BE HERE
EARLY TOMORROW MORNING

35:31.330 --> 35:32.831
TO PREP
FOR MR. YOSHIDA'S CRANIOTOMY.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.663
YEAH, ROSS, ABOUT THAT.
HUNT'S RIGHT.

35:34.663 --> 35:36.665
EVERYBODY NEEDS A SHOT
AT NEURO,

35:36.665 --> 35:39.738
AND YOU NEED A CHANCE
TO SEE OTHER SPECIALTIES,

35:39.738 --> 35:40.869
SO BROOKS IS GONNA BE
ON MY SERVICE

35:40.869 --> 35:42.211
FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.

35:42.211 --> 35:43.712
OH.

35:43.712 --> 35:45.744
OKAY.

35:45.744 --> 35:48.547
I'LL SEE YOU
WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN AGAIN.

35:48.547 --> 35:50.849
(beeping continues)

35:50.849 --> 35:52.721
ARIZONA,
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

35:52.721 --> 35:55.854
I JUST WANT TO CURL UP
IN A BALL, DO...

35:55.854 --> 35:57.556
WHOA.

35:57.556 --> 35:59.658
WHAT--WHAT THE HELL?
WHAT IS THIS?

35:59.658 --> 36:00.829
YOUR TED SPEECH.

36:00.829 --> 36:01.790
(Richard) SIT.

36:01.790 --> 36:03.161
WHAT? HOW?

36:03.161 --> 36:04.333
(Callie) HOW?

36:04.333 --> 36:05.494
I MADE A CALL.

36:05.494 --> 36:06.795
WE SET UP A VIDEO STREAM
TO THE CONFERENCE.

36:06.795 --> 36:08.767
YOU'RE GOING ON LIVE.
(Arizona laughs)

36:08.767 --> 36:09.898
OH! I DON'T HAVE MY NOTES.

36:09.898 --> 36:11.800
OH, YES. YES.
YES, YOU DO.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.772
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW
YOU KNOW IT BY HEART.

36:13.772 --> 36:14.903
I MEAN, I KNOW IT BY HEART.
JUST START TALKING.

36:14.903 --> 36:16.575
OKAY, IT'S ALMOST TIME.
BUT--BUT I--

36:16.575 --> 36:17.806
IT'S A TERRIBLE SPEECH.

36:17.806 --> 36:18.947
IT'S A GREAT SPEECH.

36:18.947 --> 36:20.309
I'M NOT...

36:20.309 --> 36:21.480
AH. AH.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.751
OH, NO.

36:23.852 --> 36:25.214
(grunts)

36:25.214 --> 36:27.286
OKAY. OKAY.

36:27.286 --> 36:30.389
FIVE, FOUR, THREE...
(man) Coming to you live from
Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital

36:30.389 --> 36:33.492
in Seattle--
Dr. Calliope Torres.
JUST TALK. JUST BE WHO YOU ARE.

36:33.492 --> 36:35.294
(applause)

36:35.294 --> 36:36.965
HI.

36:36.965 --> 36:40.529
I'M DR. CALLIE TORRES.

36:40.529 --> 36:42.731
AND...

36:45.874 --> 36:47.706
(inhales deeply)

36:53.712 --> 36:55.914
I'VE HAD A PRETTY BAD YEAR.
(chuckles)

36:55.914 --> 36:58.947
I WAS ALMOST KILLED
IN A CAR WRECK.

36:58.947 --> 37:03.852
THEN I... NEARLY LOST MY WIFE
IN AN ACCIDENT

37:03.852 --> 37:06.395
THAT CLAIMED THE LIFE
OF MY BEST FRIEND

37:06.395 --> 37:08.857
AND THE FATHER OF MY CHILD.

37:08.857 --> 37:13.001
AND... SOME OTHER STUFF.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.765
(huffs)

37:16.765 --> 37:18.967
I'M AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON
BY TRADE

37:18.967 --> 37:21.570
AND I WORK WITH CARTILAGE,

37:21.570 --> 37:23.742
SO I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME
THINKING ABOUT

37:23.742 --> 37:25.944
WHAT HOLDS US TOGETHER

37:25.944 --> 37:28.777
WHEN THINGS FALL APART.

37:33.882 --> 37:37.486
(indistinct conversations)

37:37.486 --> 37:41.330
I'M SO SORRY I HAVEN'T BEEN
TO VISIT YOU MORE TODAY.

37:41.330 --> 37:43.762
(inhales and exhales)

37:43.762 --> 37:46.034
ARE YOU OKAY?

37:49.898 --> 37:52.040
DO YOU...

37:52.040 --> 37:54.773
DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT GOD PLANS

37:54.773 --> 37:56.875
FOR TWO PEOPLE
TO BE TOGETHER?

37:56.875 --> 38:00.379
YEAH, I DO.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.381
MY PATIENT DIED.

38:02.381 --> 38:07.516
HER HUSBAND IS LEFT
WITH THEIR NEW BABY.

38:07.516 --> 38:08.817
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

38:08.817 --> 38:10.989
(exhales) IT JUST--
IT DOESN'T--

38:10.989 --> 38:13.762
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

38:13.762 --> 38:15.594
(sighs)

38:15.594 --> 38:18.667
WHY WOULD HE BRING
THESE TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER,

38:18.667 --> 38:21.870
MAKE THEM FALL IN LOVE,
O-OPEN UP TO ONE ANOTHER,

38:21.870 --> 38:24.673
MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE THEY WERE
MEANT TO BE TOGETHER,

38:24.673 --> 38:28.407
AND THEN JUST...
PULL THEM APART?

38:28.407 --> 38:29.738
APRIL...

38:29.738 --> 38:31.810
(sighs deeply)

38:31.810 --> 38:33.542
I GET IT.

38:35.784 --> 38:39.348

BUT I'M HERE.

I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

38:47.426 --> 38:49.498

39:06.845 --> 39:07.976
(Owen clears throat)

39:07.976 --> 39:09.648
I TALKED TO RUSSELL.

39:09.648 --> 39:10.819
MM-HMM.

39:10.819 --> 39:12.681
AND HE AGREES WITH
YOUR COURSE OF HYPOTHERMIA,

39:12.681 --> 39:14.122
ALTHOUGH HE MAY
ONLY BE AGREEING

39:14.122 --> 39:15.654
BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID OF YOU.

39:15.654 --> 39:16.785
LIKE YOU SAID...

39:16.785 --> 39:18.457
YOU'RE HIS BOSS NOW.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.989

39:28.366 --> 39:30.999
OH, MY GOD. A LITTLE BOY?
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT?

39:30.999 --> 39:32.370
I WOULD'VE
RETHOUGHT EVERYTHING.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.972
I WOULD'VE ACTUALLY
TRIED TO SAVE THE MAN.

39:33.972 --> 39:35.674
CRISTINA--

39:35.674 --> 39:36.805
DO YOU THINK THAT I WOULD
MAKE A DECISION THAT IS NOT

39:36.805 --> 39:38.807
IN THE BEST INTEREST
OF MY PATIENT?

39:38.807 --> 39:41.780
I JUST WANT THIS KID
TO SEE HIS DAD AGAIN.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.912
I DO, TOO.
