<i>In the immortal words
of Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter,</i>

00:05.712 --> 00:07.010
<i>"Who run the world?</i>

00:07.042 --> 00:08.718
<i>Girls."</i>

00:08.743 --> 00:12.015
<i>Not exactly true, Queen Bey,
but we're getting there.</i>

00:12.048 --> 00:13.449
<i>And for women today,</i>

00:13.474 --> 00:15.895
<i>our collective voice
has never been louder.</i>

00:21.624 --> 00:24.261
<i>And yet, despite being
arguably better than ever</i>

00:24.293 --> 00:26.595
<i>at advocating for ourselves as a group,</i>

00:26.628 --> 00:28.664
<i>on an individual, interpersonal,</i>

00:28.697 --> 00:30.499
<i>and romantic level,</i>

00:30.532 --> 00:32.368
<i>we may still have some work to do.</i>

00:32.401 --> 00:34.603
I don't know how you make
such an uncomfortable couch

00:34.636 --> 00:36.106
look cozy, but you do.

00:36.139 --> 00:38.775
And I wish I could stay,
but I have to get to campus.

00:38.807 --> 00:40.543
Wait for me. I have class
at 10.:00 I'll go with you.

00:40.576 --> 00:42.278
I can't today. I'm sorry.

00:42.312 --> 00:44.281
I'm gonna carpool with Professor Wedeen.

00:44.313 --> 00:47.219
And if I ask if my 19-year-old
girlfriend can hitch a ride...

00:47.244 --> 00:48.450
- Mm-hmm.
- ...you know, it tips her off

00:48.484 --> 00:50.453
that I have a 19-year-old girlfriend.

00:50.486 --> 00:51.488
Why don't we just say

00:51.520 --> 00:54.990
that I'm your foreign exchange student?

00:55.023 --> 00:56.792
<i>¿Dónde está la español?</i>

00:56.825 --> 00:58.027
- It's good, right?
- Huh.

00:58.060 --> 01:00.196
- Your girl's been watching "Narcos".
- Hmm.

01:00.229 --> 01:03.133
Tempting.

01:03.166 --> 01:04.834
But no. Not today, I'm sorry.

01:04.866 --> 01:06.969
- Okay.
- Look, stay here. Enjoy yourself.

01:07.003 --> 01:10.206
If you feel like it, take that
couch, toss it in a fire.

01:10.240 --> 01:13.042
I hate it anyway.

01:13.075 --> 01:14.544
I'll call you later?

01:14.577 --> 01:15.979
- Yep.
- Okay.

01:24.253 --> 01:25.521
- Morning!
- Morning.

01:25.554 --> 01:27.523
You want in on this? It's tofu eggs

01:27.556 --> 01:28.924
for our resident vegan.

01:28.958 --> 01:31.494
No, I've already had my
recommended daily allowance

01:31.527 --> 01:33.697
of, uh, disappointment for the day.

01:33.729 --> 01:36.232
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:36.265 --> 01:38.500
Yay, food.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.836
Oh, gross Luca food.

01:40.869 --> 01:42.838
You know, sometimes I wonder...

01:42.872 --> 01:44.441
what came first,

01:44.473 --> 01:47.042
the chicken or you haters?

01:47.075 --> 01:48.979
'Sup, party people?

01:52.649 --> 01:54.117
Okay. Uh, well,

01:54.149 --> 01:55.785
just get at me... whenever.

01:55.818 --> 01:56.920
Okay.

02:03.625 --> 02:05.227
It's all good.

02:05.261 --> 02:08.398
We get at each other now.

02:08.430 --> 02:10.199
I don't know what's more fake,

02:10.233 --> 02:12.369
my friends pretending they're fine

02:12.401 --> 02:13.702
or these eggs.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.175
Wow!

02:53.209 --> 02:54.343
Wow.

02:54.376 --> 02:56.645
So, it seems like Aaron changed his mind

02:56.679 --> 02:58.448
- about being in a relationship.
- Mm-hmm.

02:58.481 --> 03:01.084
Oh, no. No one's in a relationship.

03:01.116 --> 03:02.685
I just... I just thought about it,

03:02.718 --> 03:05.788
and I realized that, you know
what, we are in college.

03:05.822 --> 03:08.991
If there is a time to be free
and enjoy myself,

03:09.025 --> 03:10.627
that is now.

03:10.660 --> 03:12.262
And, well, I just...

03:12.294 --> 03:13.929
I really enjoy myself with Aaron.

03:13.962 --> 03:15.597
In fact, last night, I, uh,

03:15.631 --> 03:17.934
enjoyed myself <i> three times!</i>

03:17.966 --> 03:19.268
Ooh. High three.

03:19.301 --> 03:21.137
Aah! Thank you!

03:21.169 --> 03:23.672
Plus, it's not like he's gonna
be Mr. Aaron Torres. Come on.

03:23.705 --> 03:25.341
True. I mean, think about it.

03:25.375 --> 03:27.943
None of us in the next 15 years
is gonna have a last name.

03:27.977 --> 03:29.846
We're all gonna have
barcodes on our elbows.

03:29.878 --> 03:32.816
You know what, as long
as you're happy, I'm happy.

03:32.848 --> 03:34.950
But just make sure you're not settling

03:34.983 --> 03:36.385
for less than you deserve.

03:36.418 --> 03:37.619
I don't think Ana's settling.

03:37.652 --> 03:38.888
I mean, trying to make something work

03:38.920 --> 03:39.989
with someone you really like,

03:40.021 --> 03:42.292
even if it's not exactly what you want,

03:42.324 --> 03:44.526
- it's very m-mature.
- It <i>is</i> mature,

03:44.560 --> 03:47.063
but sometimes it can be
a little undefined,

03:47.096 --> 03:49.699
and, like, for me personally,
it's a hard place to be in.

03:49.732 --> 03:52.301
Yeah. But, like, for <i> other</i> people,

03:52.335 --> 03:55.071
probably a hard place
to be is, you know,

03:55.103 --> 03:57.706
the traditional relationship
you guys are in.

03:57.739 --> 03:59.074
You're, like, cuffed up

03:59.108 --> 04:01.009
and basically living together
in college.

04:01.043 --> 04:03.646
All right. Well, let's all just agree

04:03.679 --> 04:06.316
to live in peace
and enjoy our relationships,

04:06.348 --> 04:08.184
- traditional or otherwise.
- Mm-hmm.

04:08.216 --> 04:10.419
Well, I am off to my traditional job

04:10.453 --> 04:11.654
with a traditional boss

04:11.686 --> 04:14.424
who will dock my traditional paycheck

04:14.457 --> 04:16.091
if I show up late again...

04:16.124 --> 04:18.827
as is my tradition.

04:18.861 --> 04:21.363
Honey, I'll be home at 6:00.

04:21.397 --> 04:23.099
Wow. I'm blown away.

04:23.131 --> 04:24.934
She works <i> too</i> damn hard.

04:27.035 --> 04:29.338
And just a reminder,
all sales are final,

04:29.371 --> 04:31.340
so if you truly believe
that this "Titan Green"

04:31.374 --> 04:34.443
will enhance your, uh,
winter complexion,

04:34.477 --> 04:36.179
then you know what?

04:36.212 --> 04:37.614
Go, Titans!

04:42.785 --> 04:44.587
Oh, my God.

04:44.619 --> 04:46.221
That is Professor Hewson!

04:46.254 --> 04:48.457
But you know what?
It'll be fine because I can be cool.

04:48.491 --> 04:50.926
Who cares whether or not
she's dating my roommate?

04:50.960 --> 04:52.529
It'll be fine.
I don't have to talk to her.

04:52.561 --> 04:55.198
Plus, she's in here buying
some old lady book, I'm sure.

04:55.230 --> 04:56.732
Probably, like, the Bible.

04:56.765 --> 04:58.367
Doubt she even saw me.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.802
Zoey?

04:59.835 --> 05:01.103
Hi, I'm Zoey.

05:01.136 --> 05:02.371
- I know.
- You know.

05:02.405 --> 05:03.606
I know that, too,

05:03.638 --> 05:05.809
'cause you know me from class,

05:05.842 --> 05:08.378
which is, pbht, where I know
you from, silly goose.

05:08.410 --> 05:09.578
I got your nose.

05:09.612 --> 05:10.746
Sorry, that was weird.

05:10.780 --> 05:12.080
- I'm sure we'll get past it.
- Yeah.

05:12.114 --> 05:13.750
Ohh.

05:13.782 --> 05:16.485
"Ayesha Curry: The Seasoned Life." Nice.

05:16.518 --> 05:18.388
For your next dinner party?

05:18.421 --> 05:19.722
Not that it's any of my business

05:19.754 --> 05:21.089
whether or not you throw dinner parties.

05:21.123 --> 05:22.959
Although, me and my roommates
do love a dinner party.

05:22.991 --> 05:24.160
Not that you'd know my roommate,

05:24.193 --> 05:25.562
particularly my blond roommate.

05:25.595 --> 05:26.796
Anyways, Ayesha Curry

05:26.828 --> 05:29.566
has a fantastic mac and cheese
recipe in here

05:29.599 --> 05:32.135
that will knock your socks off.
Nomi told me about it.

05:32.167 --> 05:34.069
But not that you know Nomi,

05:34.102 --> 05:35.938
because what is a Nomi?

05:35.972 --> 05:37.806
Not anything I know, me.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.609
Zoey. Stop.

05:41.878 --> 05:45.414
You clearly know
about Nomi and me, so...

05:45.448 --> 05:48.084
It's fine. I just want to pay for this,
and I want to get out of here.

05:48.116 --> 05:49.818
You know what?

05:49.852 --> 05:51.354
Just take it.

05:51.386 --> 05:53.422
Yeah, it's on me.

05:53.455 --> 05:55.525
A gift from me to you.

05:56.792 --> 05:59.662
My favorite professor, P. Hewson.

05:59.695 --> 06:01.130
Okay, thanks.

06:01.162 --> 06:02.631
All right.

06:04.633 --> 06:06.602
Well, I mean, that wasn't terrible.

06:06.636 --> 06:08.604
And, technically, she just stole,

06:08.638 --> 06:10.440
so I have that on her now.

06:10.472 --> 06:12.307
But you know what?
If she says things are fine,

06:12.340 --> 06:13.809
then I'm going to have to trust

06:13.842 --> 06:17.112
that things are totally
and completely fine.

06:17.145 --> 06:19.448
Because that's just feminism.

06:19.482 --> 06:20.950
What do you mean, "It's fine"?

06:20.982 --> 06:22.818
You told her you know about us.

06:22.852 --> 06:24.787
Zo! I told you explicitly

06:24.820 --> 06:28.658
not to say anything
to anyone about us... ever!

06:28.691 --> 06:30.393
I gave her my special discount.

06:30.426 --> 06:33.630
- You made her steal?!
- Nomi, I'm so sorry.

06:33.662 --> 06:35.664
I'm not good under pressure.
You know this about me.

06:35.698 --> 06:36.965
It's just really difficult

06:36.999 --> 06:38.801
'cause I'm literally
standing face-to-face

06:38.833 --> 06:40.470
with such a huge secret.

06:40.503 --> 06:41.804
It's actually... It's not difficult.

06:41.837 --> 06:44.207
It's really easy, 'cause you
just don't say anything!

06:44.239 --> 06:45.975
And that feels right to you?

06:46.008 --> 06:47.977
Yes. It feels right to me, okay?

06:48.010 --> 06:49.846
And just because
you can't wrap <i> your</i> head

06:49.878 --> 06:51.080
around <i> my</i> relationship,

06:51.112 --> 06:54.383
it doesn't give you the right
to interfere!

06:54.417 --> 06:56.419
Zo, you might have just
ruined everything.

06:56.451 --> 06:58.053
- I might've ruined your relationship?
- Mm-hmm.

06:58.087 --> 06:59.989
No, Nomi, you do <i> not</i> get to do that.

07:00.022 --> 07:01.858
Because isn't she the one
that won't let you

07:01.890 --> 07:03.492
talk to your friends about her?

07:03.525 --> 07:06.496
I mean, gosh, let alone be seen
in public with her!

07:07.530 --> 07:08.731
You know what?

07:08.763 --> 07:10.866
Not that it's any of your business,

07:10.900 --> 07:12.001
but those are the terms

07:12.034 --> 07:13.827
of my "non-traditional" relationship...

07:13.852 --> 07:15.469
- "Non-traditional" relationship.
- ...and I'm fine with it!

07:15.494 --> 07:17.133
- I'm fine with it!
- Don't you see

07:17.158 --> 07:20.376
how much you're giving up
to be in this relationship?

07:20.409 --> 07:22.178
I'm not giving anything up.

07:22.210 --> 07:23.946
It's called compromise.

07:23.979 --> 07:27.182
Dude, compromises are concessions.

07:27.215 --> 07:29.051
Oh, my God. Really?

07:29.085 --> 07:32.055
You want to talk about concession, Zoey?

07:32.087 --> 07:34.289
If <i> anyone</i> should know anything

07:34.323 --> 07:36.059
about making concessions
in a relationship,

07:36.092 --> 07:37.193
it is you.

07:37.225 --> 07:38.694
What in the world are you talking about?

07:38.727 --> 07:40.263
Zoey, please.

07:40.296 --> 07:42.932
All you do is make concessions
in your relationship.

07:42.965 --> 07:44.967
You... You eat what he wants to eat.

07:45.001 --> 07:46.369
You watch what he wants to watch.

07:46.402 --> 07:47.870
You even wear buns in your hair

07:47.902 --> 07:49.772
to keep his rings from getting
caught in your hair,

07:49.804 --> 07:52.307
and you <i> hate</i> buns!

07:52.340 --> 07:54.910
Luca calls all the shots
in your relationship.

07:54.943 --> 07:57.146
You know what? It's... It's pathetic.

08:11.594 --> 08:15.398
Okay, well, since you're
taking orders, um...

08:15.431 --> 08:17.834
I'll have a rosé wine cooler, please.

08:17.866 --> 08:19.402
Ooh, no, sorry. No embarrassing drinks

08:19.434 --> 08:21.403
at this particular
establishment, but maybe...

08:21.436 --> 08:22.972
Ohh, okay.

08:23.004 --> 08:25.674
Coming from the guy
that drinks appletinis.

08:25.708 --> 08:27.744
Uh, just make me anything.
I'll be right back.

08:27.777 --> 08:29.412
It was a Midori sour, not an appletini.

08:29.445 --> 08:30.780
Two very different fruits.

08:30.812 --> 08:32.514
It's actually the most masculine
fruit in the fruit phylum,

08:32.547 --> 08:33.916
if you think about it!

08:33.948 --> 08:36.818
Uh, and it's in the name...
It's like muskmelon, manly.

08:36.851 --> 08:38.253
- She's not listening.
- Okay!

08:38.287 --> 08:39.989
I see you over there with Aaron

08:40.022 --> 08:42.221
laughing like you're in
a French movie with subtitles.

08:42.246 --> 08:43.592
I'm impressed.

08:43.625 --> 08:45.494
I didn't know you had
French romance in you.

08:45.527 --> 08:46.829
Thank you.

08:46.861 --> 08:49.264
Since you're so uptight and controlling.

08:49.297 --> 08:51.133
- Excuse me?
- Ignore her.

08:51.167 --> 08:53.503
We're detoxing for the NCAA finals,

08:53.536 --> 08:56.039
and the lack of tequila
and CHEETOS in her system

08:56.071 --> 08:57.373
has her a bit cranky.

08:57.406 --> 08:58.941
Well, I don't care what anyone says.

08:58.974 --> 09:00.176
I'm having a good time.

09:00.209 --> 09:01.444
Wow.

09:01.476 --> 09:03.446
You are definitely stronger than me.

09:03.479 --> 09:05.782
I couldn't do a situationship with Doug.

09:05.815 --> 09:06.883
I love hard.

09:06.916 --> 09:08.151
Some would say too hard.

09:08.183 --> 09:09.451
Everybody would say too hard.

09:09.484 --> 09:11.653
Even our mom won't give Jazz
her e-mail address.

09:11.686 --> 09:14.289
Jokes on her. I hacked that shit.

09:14.322 --> 09:15.792
Come at me, Brenda.

09:15.825 --> 09:18.393
My point is, I'd be losing it right now

09:18.426 --> 09:20.495
if the dude I was smashing
was over there

09:20.528 --> 09:22.297
doing a pick and roll...

09:22.330 --> 09:24.133
on Chastity Decas.

09:24.166 --> 09:25.902
- What?
- Whoa.

09:28.204 --> 09:30.138
Guys, I'm good. Yeah, no.

09:30.172 --> 09:31.139
That's... That's part of the deal.

09:31.172 --> 09:32.340
We both get the freedom

09:32.374 --> 09:34.210
to pick and roll with whoever we want.

09:37.846 --> 09:41.617
Luca, I need a pep talk
before I post this bag to eBay.

09:43.185 --> 09:46.856
Why? It high-key clashed
with my party vibe.

09:46.888 --> 09:50.025
Not really the pep talk I was
looking for, but you know what?

09:50.058 --> 09:52.027
Gets the job done.

09:52.061 --> 09:54.997
Huh. That was easy.

09:56.798 --> 10:01.436
My fourth favorite pair of
classic Louboutins just sold.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.372
Can we ease the pain over margaritas?

10:03.404 --> 10:06.241
Drinks on me, 'cause I got money now.

10:06.274 --> 10:08.176
Yeah, I can make you
a margarita right here,

10:08.210 --> 10:10.012
where we can chill and cuddle.

10:10.045 --> 10:12.749
What flavor do you want,
banana or raisin?

10:12.782 --> 10:15.218
<i>Or</i> we could go to Titanium,

10:15.250 --> 10:16.918
sit on the patio,

10:16.951 --> 10:19.522
and celebrate the life of
a truly gorgeous pair of shoes

10:19.555 --> 10:21.124
that's making some
high school boy in Denver

10:21.157 --> 10:23.225
the most fabulous kid
in school right now

10:23.258 --> 10:27.095
over <i> regular</i> margaritas,
chips, and salsa.

10:27.128 --> 10:28.864
That place is always so full of bodies.

10:28.898 --> 10:31.433
Mars is in retrograde.

10:31.466 --> 10:32.601
I just don't want to risk

10:32.634 --> 10:34.136
running into a Sagittarius right now.

10:34.170 --> 10:36.038
All right, then...

10:36.071 --> 10:37.540
what do you... what are you feeling?

10:37.572 --> 10:38.941
What about that sushi spot?

10:38.974 --> 10:41.143
You love their dynamite roll,
and they deliver mad fast.

10:41.176 --> 10:43.211
Well, you're not wrong. I do...

10:43.244 --> 10:45.047
Done. Got you.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.816
- We're getting sushi in 22 minutes.
- Right now...

10:49.652 --> 10:51.720
I'm gonna switch into
my cuddle kimono...

10:51.753 --> 10:54.289
a little, uh, less fabric
between you and me, you know?

10:54.322 --> 10:55.424
Okay.

10:58.426 --> 10:59.729
Chug! Chug!

10:59.762 --> 11:02.431
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

11:06.768 --> 11:08.403
Hi, girl.

11:08.436 --> 11:09.906
You okay?

11:09.939 --> 11:11.908
You're hitting that vodka pretty hard.

11:11.941 --> 11:13.008
Hot take...

11:13.042 --> 11:14.643
parties are fun!

11:14.676 --> 11:16.412
Are you sure the fun you're having

11:16.445 --> 11:18.980
isn't because of the "fun"
happening over there?

11:19.013 --> 11:20.316
Pshh.

11:20.349 --> 11:22.819
I know who Aaron's going home with.

11:22.851 --> 11:24.419
My money's on Chastity.

11:24.452 --> 11:26.922
Her pick and rolls have turned
into body rolls, and...

11:26.955 --> 11:28.488
- they are on point.
- Please.

11:28.489 --> 11:30.692
I know Aaron.
10 seconds of me getting at him,

11:30.725 --> 11:32.260
and he's mine.

11:32.293 --> 11:33.461
Watch.

11:33.494 --> 11:35.597
- I'll prove it.
- Okay.

11:42.872 --> 11:44.540
Mm-hmm.

11:44.572 --> 11:46.508
Um...

11:46.542 --> 11:48.043
I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me.

11:48.076 --> 11:49.711
I've left my toaster in the oven.

11:49.744 --> 11:52.782
I should go take it <i>
out</i> of the oven... right now.

11:52.815 --> 11:55.350
- Come on.
- Okay. Bye!

11:58.253 --> 12:00.455
<i>As I took a bite of my rainbow roll,</i>

12:00.489 --> 12:04.359
<i>all I tasted was imitation crab
and compromise.</i>

12:04.393 --> 12:07.662
<i>This wasn't the meal I wanted,
the beverage I wanted,</i>

12:07.696 --> 12:10.032
<i>or even the location I wanted.</i>

12:10.065 --> 12:12.468
<i>Nomi's words kinda haunted me.</i>

12:12.500 --> 12:15.337
<i>I mean, how many of these
moments had there been?</i>

12:15.370 --> 12:17.973
<i>How many concessions to Luca had I made?</i>

12:20.843 --> 12:23.646
Uh, you know what? This isn't right.

12:23.678 --> 12:27.649
No, baby, that's actually how
the rams sharpen their horns.

12:27.682 --> 12:30.253
Not what I meant.

12:30.286 --> 12:32.722
Okay, this may seem stupid,

12:32.754 --> 12:34.489
but, you know, selling those shoes

12:34.523 --> 12:36.558
was a small victory for me.

12:36.591 --> 12:39.227
And literally, all I wanted
to do was to celebrate

12:39.260 --> 12:43.098
with a margarita, salsa,
and chips on a sunny patio.

12:43.132 --> 12:45.034
I'm sorry.

12:45.066 --> 12:47.003
I guess I didn't realize
you wanted it that bad,

12:47.036 --> 12:50.172
but, um, maybe we can do that next time?

12:50.205 --> 12:51.907
Yeah, but I don't want it next time.

12:51.941 --> 12:53.242
I want it now.

12:53.274 --> 12:56.177
So I'm gonna get it now.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.779
Are you leaving? Do you want me to come?

12:57.812 --> 12:58.847
No.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.782
Sushi at home is what you wanted,

13:00.816 --> 13:03.185
so, you know, you should have that.

13:03.218 --> 13:06.022
I want something else,

13:06.055 --> 13:08.891
and I'm realizing that that's okay.

13:08.923 --> 13:10.393
Are you mad? 'Cause, real talk,

13:10.426 --> 13:11.960
I'm... I'm feeling like this is a trap.

13:11.994 --> 13:14.196
Totally not mad. Enjoy your rams.

13:14.229 --> 13:15.131
Bye.

13:28.277 --> 13:30.546
Look, I'm so, so sorry.

13:30.579 --> 13:31.948
Zoey, she's an idiot.

13:31.980 --> 13:33.615
And I'm sure you know that
just from knowing her.

13:33.648 --> 13:35.116
But I swear, she's not gonna
tell anyone.

13:35.149 --> 13:36.818
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, no, no. I'm sure.

13:36.851 --> 13:39.888
You have to understand
how hard it's been for me

13:39.922 --> 13:42.992
not to share my <i> first</i> big
relationship with my friends.

13:43.024 --> 13:44.292
Oh, friends? Plural?

13:44.325 --> 13:47.095
So it's... i-i-it's not
just Zoey who knows.

13:47.128 --> 13:48.965
Okay, technically, you know,

13:48.998 --> 13:50.166
Ana and the twins know, too.

13:50.199 --> 13:51.767
But Jazz and Sky,
they only talk to each other,

13:51.800 --> 13:53.135
and it's, like, often at the same time.

13:53.167 --> 13:54.402
And they do this weird clapping thing,

13:54.436 --> 13:55.571
and I'm not allowed to do it.

13:55.604 --> 13:57.907
Then everybody tunes out Ana
all the time anyways,

13:57.940 --> 13:59.475
- so we're good!
- Nomi, Nomi.

13:59.508 --> 14:01.243
Please stop.

14:01.276 --> 14:02.411
Why?

14:02.444 --> 14:04.013
Look, this whole thing has just gotten

14:04.046 --> 14:06.415
very out of control, very fast.

14:06.447 --> 14:08.249
And...

14:08.282 --> 14:09.451
I don't trust her.

14:11.452 --> 14:14.489
And I, honestly... I don't trust <i> you.</i>

14:14.523 --> 14:17.192
Okay, please don't say that.
You can trust me.

14:17.225 --> 14:18.259
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

14:18.292 --> 14:20.196
Because every time you tell someone,

14:20.229 --> 14:21.497
you betray me.

14:21.529 --> 14:23.431
- Are you <i> serious</i> right now?
- Yeah. Yes.

14:23.465 --> 14:25.334
- I betrayed you?!
- Yes!

14:25.367 --> 14:27.770
You're the one who sold me
on this whole, like,

14:27.802 --> 14:30.105
"live out loud, be proud
of my sexuality" thing.

14:30.138 --> 14:32.774
But all I've done these last few months

14:32.807 --> 14:35.878
is, like, sneak around,
lie to <i> everybody,</i>

14:35.911 --> 14:37.446
and ditch my friends to be with you

14:37.479 --> 14:39.849
when you would have me around.

14:39.882 --> 14:42.952
I'm just <i> so tired</i>

14:42.984 --> 14:44.986
of being afraid of disappointing you.

14:45.019 --> 14:46.855
- Nomi.
- Mnh-mnh.

14:46.888 --> 14:49.291
I'm tired, actually, of, um...

14:49.324 --> 14:51.960
disappointing myself.

14:51.994 --> 14:53.662
I can't do this.

15:04.440 --> 15:07.143
Score! It's clean!

15:07.176 --> 15:09.711
This morning's me
really had my back today.

15:11.846 --> 15:15.417
She must've known
I was having company over.

15:15.450 --> 15:17.420
Whoa, I can tell you're really
feeling those shots, aren't ya?

15:18.619 --> 15:21.157
Yep, there it is.
Okay, let's get you to bed.

15:21.190 --> 15:23.859
You're no fun.

15:23.892 --> 15:24.994
Come on.

15:30.865 --> 15:31.900
Okay.

15:36.138 --> 15:39.441
Will you stay with me
until I fall asleep?

15:40.542 --> 15:41.777
Yeah, sure.

15:43.445 --> 15:44.946
- Okay.
- Just...

15:54.556 --> 15:57.026
How you feeling? You feeling sick?
You got the spins?

15:57.058 --> 15:58.526
How many Aarons do you see?

15:58.560 --> 15:59.695
Just four.

15:59.728 --> 16:01.229
Just four, great.

16:01.263 --> 16:02.697
- Yeah.
- That's usual.

16:02.730 --> 16:05.533
And they're sexy as hell.

16:05.566 --> 16:08.104
Oh, no, no. Come on, come on.

16:08.137 --> 16:10.705
Let's just get some rest, okay?

16:14.075 --> 16:15.277
Mm-hmm.

16:23.420 --> 16:25.800
You don't want to be
in a relationship with me.

16:29.258 --> 16:32.494
Come on, you're drunk.
Now is not the time.

16:32.527 --> 16:34.562
We can talk about it another time, okay?

16:36.412 --> 16:39.468
But you wanted to be
in a relationship with Zoey.

16:41.769 --> 16:43.304
Hmm.

16:59.153 --> 17:00.922
Hey.

17:00.955 --> 17:01.991
Hey.

17:02.023 --> 17:04.993
I, um, saw you were here.

17:05.026 --> 17:06.161
No Luca?

17:06.194 --> 17:08.097
Mm, no.

17:08.128 --> 17:10.665
I'm trying this new thing
where I do what I want,

17:10.698 --> 17:13.435
- even if it means doing it alone.
- Mm.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.538
The hostess threw some shade,
but still I persisted.

17:26.982 --> 17:29.718
I'm sorry I said those things
about you and Luca.

17:29.751 --> 17:32.054
Yeah, I know. But you were right.

17:32.087 --> 17:33.289
I mean, you told the truth

17:33.321 --> 17:36.792
about all the concessions
I was making to Luca.

17:36.824 --> 17:38.226
And, you know, honestly,

17:38.260 --> 17:42.965
I-I-I don't even know
why I didn't notice it before.

17:42.997 --> 17:45.200
You know, I'm also really sorry

17:45.234 --> 17:47.468
about messing things up with Paige.

17:47.502 --> 17:49.370
So, I broke it off.

17:49.404 --> 17:51.907
God, Nomi, I'm so sorry.

17:51.939 --> 17:56.311
Um, how are you feeling?
Are you... okay?

17:58.013 --> 18:02.184
Honestly, um, I'm sad.

18:02.216 --> 18:04.820
But, ultimately, you were right.

18:04.852 --> 18:06.187
I just, uh,

18:06.221 --> 18:08.224
never stopped to realize

18:08.256 --> 18:10.491
everything I was giving up
to be with her

18:10.524 --> 18:14.162
'cause I wanted to please her, and...

18:14.196 --> 18:17.233
I just, like, wanted her to like me.

18:17.265 --> 18:20.034
I'm so sorry.

18:20.068 --> 18:22.905
You know what, why don't we
promise each other

18:22.937 --> 18:25.174
to never compromise our happiness

18:25.206 --> 18:28.944
for anyone else's anymore?

18:28.976 --> 18:31.580
Deal.

18:31.612 --> 18:33.248
You know, if you, like,

18:33.282 --> 18:36.085
really, really,<i> really</i>
wanted to make me feel better,

18:36.118 --> 18:38.657
you should probably give me
that margarita.

18:38.691 --> 18:41.547
But that would be putting
your happiness in front of mine.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.368
I know, but I think it would, like,

18:43.393 --> 18:45.453
really help right now.

18:45.478 --> 18:46.586
This one time.

18:49.263 --> 18:51.300
<i>In a time when women are advocating</i>

18:51.332 --> 18:53.468
<i>so loudly for one another,</i>

18:53.502 --> 18:55.404
<i>it's good to have someone in your life</i>

18:55.436 --> 18:57.773
<i>who you know is looking out for you.</i>

18:57.805 --> 19:00.475
<i>And while some of us still
needed a little help</i>

19:00.509 --> 19:02.378
<i>knowing when to stand up
for ourselves...</i>

19:04.111 --> 19:05.980
<i>...others were taking baby steps</i>

19:06.013 --> 19:09.385
<i>to do it on their own.</i>

20:04.276 --> 20:06.697
Goodbye, Hans.

20:09.410 --> 20:11.846
Au revoir, Christian.

20:11.879 --> 20:15.149
Auf Wiedersehen, Andersen.

20:15.183 --> 20:18.020
Banana raisin margarita
to ease the pain?

20:18.052 --> 20:19.287
Absolutely.

20:22.424 --> 20:24.993
Thank you for your sacrifice.

20:25.025 --> 20:27.962
You will not be forgotten.

20:27.995 --> 20:29.264
They were so young.

20:31.366 --> 20:32.801
Yum, yum.

20:38.740 --> 20:40.209
You may want to close your eyes, babe.

20:40.242 --> 20:43.479
This is gonna be painful to watch.

20:43.503 --> 20:46.390
Huh. Is this one Christian?

20:46.415 --> 20:47.750
Inconsiderate.
