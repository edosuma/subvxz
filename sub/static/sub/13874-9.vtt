WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:06.966
My name is Shake-Zula

00:07.000 --> 00:07.901
The Mike Ruler

00:07.934 --> 00:08.767
The Old Schooler

00:08.801 --> 00:09.767
You want to trip?

00:09.801 --> 00:11.302

00:11.335 --> 00:13.102
Frylock and I'm on top

00:14.103 --> 00:15.369
Meatwad, you're up next

00:16.837 --> 00:18.469

00:19.536 --> 00:21.905
Meatwad get the honeys, g.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.271
Driving in my car

00:23.305 --> 00:24.605
living like a star

00:24.638 --> 00:26.205
ice on my fingers and my toes

00:26.238 --> 00:27.706
and I'm a Taurus.

00:27.739 --> 00:30.440
Uh, check-check it, yeah.

00:30.473 --> 00:32.540
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:32.573 --> 00:33.908
make the homeys say ho

00:33.941 --> 00:35.942
and the girlies want to scream.

00:35.974 --> 00:37.909
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:37.941 --> 00:39.409
make the homeys say ho

00:39.442 --> 00:41.576
and the girlies want to scream

00:41.610 --> 00:43.676
Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.611
Number One in the hood, g.

00:48.044 --> 00:48.945
Oh!

00:48.978 --> 00:49.911
Hey!

00:49.944 --> 00:51.178
I have bad Glaucoma.

00:51.212 --> 00:52.112
So?

00:52.145 --> 00:52.846
Go to the doctor.

00:52.879 --> 00:54.213
I--I did.

00:54.246 --> 00:55.913
He said you should grow me

00:55.946 --> 00:57.314
some pot.

00:57.347 --> 00:58.214
Marijuana?

00:58.247 --> 00:59.180
Whatever the kids are calling

00:59.214 --> 01:01.581
it these days, yeah, sure.

01:01.615 --> 01:03.655
He just gave me these seeds...

01:03.688 --> 01:05.188
At the Rat-Dog show.

01:05.221 --> 01:06.823
Shake, Marijuana is illegal.

01:06.857 --> 01:07.856
I won't tell on you.

01:07.889 --> 01:09.657
We're roomies, man.

01:09.690 --> 01:11.324
But if you don't grow it,

01:11.357 --> 01:13.124
I'm gonna tell on you.

01:13.158 --> 01:14.224
That doesn't make any sense.

01:14.258 --> 01:15.459
Yeah, it does.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.459
Well, we have vast fields and

01:18.492 --> 01:21.226
amber waves of Marijuana on the

01:21.260 --> 01:22.027
moon.

01:22.061 --> 01:23.394
it's called Moonajuana, boy!

01:23.426 --> 01:25.194
will you up.

01:25.227 --> 01:26.061
I'm on it right now.

01:26.094 --> 01:27.162
And he loves it.

01:27.195 --> 01:27.895
See?!

01:27.928 --> 01:29.062
These guys got it!

01:29.095 --> 01:30.563
And they're not even afflicted

01:30.596 --> 01:32.496
with my crippling Glaucoma!

01:32.529 --> 01:34.029
We have something worse.

01:34.063 --> 01:34.829
Butt Cancer.

01:34.863 --> 01:35.764
Butt Crack Cancer.

01:35.797 --> 01:36.764
And yeast infections.

01:36.797 --> 01:37.497
Yes!

01:37.530 --> 01:39.297
Yeast unleashed in the East.

01:39.330 --> 01:40.098
Check it!

01:40.131 --> 01:40.931
Those aren't diseases.

01:40.965 --> 01:42.565
Not any more, Fry Man.

01:42.598 --> 01:43.632
The Moonajuana scared it out

01:43.666 --> 01:44.632
of existence.

01:44.666 --> 01:45.566
We have other diseases we

01:45.600 --> 01:46.566
need to prevent.

01:46.599 --> 01:47.533
That's correct.

01:47.567 --> 01:49.167
So, you know...

01:49.200 --> 01:50.801
Still got to smoke.

01:50.834 --> 01:52.268
Aw, come on, Frylock.

01:52.301 --> 01:53.334
Please?!

01:53.368 --> 01:54.835
You gonna just sit there and let

01:54.869 --> 01:56.903
the diseases come to us?!

01:56.936 --> 01:59.203
Or are you gonna be cool and let

01:59.236 --> 02:01.604
us smoke some sweet Mary Jane?

02:01.636 --> 02:02.403
Moony Jane.

02:02.437 --> 02:03.644
Yeah, Mooning Jane.

02:03.677 --> 02:04.611
You can do what you want...

02:04.644 --> 02:05.711
As long as you keep it away from

02:05.744 --> 02:07.378
me and Meatwad.

02:07.412 --> 02:08.713
I don't need that junk

02:08.746 --> 02:10.645
corrupting my mind.

02:10.679 --> 02:12.246
I need all my energy...

02:12.279 --> 02:13.347
For Crack Cocaine.

02:13.380 --> 02:14.214
Meatwad!

02:14.247 --> 02:15.147
Ha ha ha.

02:15.180 --> 02:16.515
That's what I'm into!

02:16.548 --> 02:18.315
Hard-core Crack.

02:18.348 --> 02:19.882
That's why my teeth are so bad.

02:19.915 --> 02:21.049
Well done.

02:21.082 --> 02:22.882
We are thought of highly by

02:22.916 --> 02:24.282
those without jobs.

02:24.316 --> 02:25.083
Oh, well, don't be surprised

02:25.117 --> 02:26.618
if I call the cops on your ass.

02:26.651 --> 02:28.017
Fry Man, we have hidden 4

02:28.050 --> 02:30.851
grams of Cocaine in your room.

02:30.884 --> 02:31.551
We did?

02:31.584 --> 02:32.718
No, we didn't do that, err,

02:32.752 --> 02:34.085
but we would.

02:34.119 --> 02:35.952
And we will tell that pigs that

02:35.985 --> 02:36.886
when they arrive.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.753
Do the thing.

02:38.786 --> 02:41.021
The pigs will never find us.

02:41.054 --> 02:42.654
For we are thin lines of

02:42.687 --> 02:43.455
deception.

02:43.488 --> 02:45.288
Deceptornominon.

02:45.322 --> 02:46.722
Err, no.

02:46.755 --> 02:47.656
Other way.

02:47.689 --> 02:48.989
Deceptonoidus.

02:49.023 --> 02:49.789
Turn this way.

02:49.823 --> 02:50.623
Oh.

02:50.656 --> 02:51.657
No, other way, third--

02:51.690 --> 02:52.690
dude, I know how to do it.

02:52.724 --> 02:53.424
I'm on it.

02:53.457 --> 02:54.325
Hey, weren't we gonna fix my

02:54.357 --> 02:55.325
Guacamole?

02:55.358 --> 02:56.591
Follow me, hippies.

02:56.625 --> 02:57.858
We are the Dope Men.

02:57.891 --> 03:00.226
Because we wear corduroy.

03:00.259 --> 03:01.126
How do--

03:01.159 --> 03:02.533
how do I smoke this?

03:02.567 --> 03:05.100
Dude, it's so cool.

03:05.133 --> 03:06.200
Tell them, err.

03:06.233 --> 03:07.434
Ok, man, see...

03:07.468 --> 03:08.668
See this bong.

03:08.702 --> 03:10.635
This is a bong.

03:10.669 --> 03:14.003
And here's how you hit it.

03:14.036 --> 03:19.771
Lower the Moon Bong.

03:19.804 --> 03:21.504
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:21.537 --> 03:23.372
boys and girls,

03:23.405 --> 03:25.573
it's Moonajuana time.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.239
Then we shall stoke the flame

03:28.273 --> 03:33.207
with Moonajuana.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.275
Dang.

03:34.308 --> 03:35.676
That looked like a big old tire.

03:35.709 --> 03:37.376
Moonajuana grows in the shape

03:37.409 --> 03:38.409
of a tire.

03:38.442 --> 03:39.643
Any dealer will tell you

03:39.677 --> 03:40.443
that.

03:40.476 --> 03:41.776
So, burn!

03:41.809 --> 03:43.343
Burn the flame!

03:43.377 --> 03:45.244
Stand by to revisit the stone

03:45.278 --> 03:45.944
age.

03:45.978 --> 03:46.744
Yeah.

03:46.778 --> 03:48.345
The Stoned Age!

03:48.378 --> 03:49.745
Ow!

03:49.779 --> 03:50.512
Light it up.

03:50.545 --> 03:51.679
I'm going head-first in this

03:51.712 --> 03:52.479
bitch.

03:52.513 --> 03:53.513
Like hell you are.

03:53.546 --> 03:54.446
I'm the one riddled with

03:54.480 --> 03:55.381
diseases.

03:55.414 --> 03:56.614
Well, I need it, too, 'cause

03:56.647 --> 03:58.381
I got the disease.

03:58.414 --> 04:03.055
And I need medication.

04:03.088 --> 04:05.023
Ok.

04:05.056 --> 04:05.689
Hey.

04:05.723 --> 04:06.523
You guys want to hit this?

04:06.557 --> 04:07.424
No, thank you.

04:07.457 --> 04:08.924
That's a poisonous tire.

04:08.957 --> 04:09.590
What?

04:09.624 --> 04:10.691
I mean, we're already very

04:10.725 --> 04:11.691
high.

04:12.558 --> 04:13.791
This is great.

04:13.825 --> 04:15.559
Whoa!

04:15.592 --> 04:17.492
I'm flying, man.

04:17.526 --> 04:18.892
Yeah.

04:18.927 --> 04:20.493
Oh, that feels good.

04:20.527 --> 04:21.194
Yeah.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.027
Don't...

04:22.060 --> 04:23.494
Don't exhale so fast.

04:24.428 --> 04:25.461
You gotta hold it in,

04:25.494 --> 04:26.761
like the pros.

04:27.929 --> 04:29.995
Oh, I just did.

04:30.029 --> 04:30.996
That's good stuff.

04:31.030 --> 04:32.363
Oh, come on, man!

04:32.397 --> 04:33.896
You're wasting the T.L.C.

04:33.930 --> 04:36.197
The T.C.B.

04:36.230 --> 04:37.330
You know, that's the chemical

04:37.364 --> 04:38.865
that unlocks the...

04:40.131 --> 04:41.165
Hey, where's the carb on this

04:41.198 --> 04:41.966
thing?

04:41.999 --> 04:42.966
We don't know.

04:42.999 --> 04:44.466
It's up your butt, dude.

04:44.499 --> 04:46.134
Oh, here it is.

04:46.167 --> 04:49.000
Up my butt.

04:49.034 --> 04:49.734
Thanks.

04:49.767 --> 04:50.768
Thanks, guys.

04:50.801 --> 04:51.635
Ooh, boy!

04:51.668 --> 04:53.035
What is that, your Colon?

04:53.068 --> 04:54.002
Get that out of your mouth.

04:54.036 --> 04:54.669
That's gross.

04:54.702 --> 04:55.470
You don't know where that's

04:55.503 --> 04:56.137
been.

04:56.170 --> 04:56.803
What?!

04:56.837 --> 04:57.803
I know.

04:57.837 --> 04:59.903
I know exactly where it's been,

04:59.938 --> 05:00.804
man.

05:00.838 --> 05:02.038
Ha ha ha ha.

05:02.071 --> 05:02.878
Hi.

05:02.911 --> 05:03.912
I'm high.

05:03.945 --> 05:05.912
Ha ha ha ha.

05:05.945 --> 05:08.112
You get it, Shake?

05:08.145 --> 05:09.380
This is awesome.

05:09.412 --> 05:10.846
You know what we need to do?

05:10.880 --> 05:12.813
We gotta get some instruments,

05:12.847 --> 05:15.347
take lessons, and learn to play

05:15.381 --> 05:16.282
them.

05:16.315 --> 05:17.748
And then we're gonna have the

05:17.782 --> 05:19.982
hottest jam of "comfortably

05:20.015 --> 05:23.283
numb" that anyone has ever heard

05:23.316 --> 05:24.517
in their life!

05:24.550 --> 05:26.117
Well, we--we can do a jam.

05:26.150 --> 05:28.185
You can jam on me with that log.

05:28.218 --> 05:29.251
I ain't feelin' nothing.

05:29.285 --> 05:33.120
Go ahead and hit me with it.

05:33.152 --> 05:34.853
Yeah!

05:34.887 --> 05:36.253
Listen to that beat!

05:36.287 --> 05:37.187
Yeah, that's good.

05:37.220 --> 05:38.321
You getting it good.

05:38.354 --> 05:39.521
Turn that beat around.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.857
This could go on for a very

05:50.891 --> 05:55.158
long time.

05:57.493 --> 06:00.259
I'm beatin' Meat!

06:00.293 --> 06:02.126
Hey, did everybody hear my joke?

06:02.159 --> 06:03.800
Ha ha ha ha.

06:03.834 --> 06:04.635
Hey, this is called "something

06:04.668 --> 06:06.368
to order--a whole loaf of

06:06.401 --> 06:07.201
bread."

06:07.235 --> 06:08.036
Hey, you--

06:08.068 --> 06:09.869
hey, you know what?

06:09.902 --> 06:11.636
Let's live forever.

06:11.669 --> 06:13.837
Whoa.

06:13.870 --> 06:19.172
And now we burgle.

06:19.205 --> 06:21.539
Can you grab the other end of--

06:21.572 --> 06:22.772
oh, hey, man.

06:22.805 --> 06:24.005
Uh, you're gonna have to pay

06:24.039 --> 06:24.840
for that.

06:24.873 --> 06:25.573
It's cool.

06:25.606 --> 06:26.340
Yeah, it's cool.

06:26.373 --> 06:27.774
No, it isn't.

06:27.807 --> 06:28.807
Oh, it's not?

06:28.841 --> 06:29.741
Well, we thought it was.

06:29.774 --> 06:30.674
No, you're gonna pay for that

06:30.707 --> 06:32.474
window or I'm calling the cops.

06:32.507 --> 06:33.875
Easy, brother.

06:33.908 --> 06:35.509
Don't harsh my buzz.

06:36.709 --> 06:37.443
No, man.

06:37.476 --> 06:38.244
Don't do that.

06:38.277 --> 06:38.977
Operator, can I get the

06:39.010 --> 06:39.910
police, please?

06:39.944 --> 06:41.144
We'll leave you be, fair

06:41.177 --> 06:43.210
brother.

06:43.244 --> 06:45.078
Ok, hand me that hose.

06:46.511 --> 06:47.512
Ha ha ha.

06:47.546 --> 06:50.113
Ok, start pushing it in there.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.747
I'm getting some back draft or

06:53.780 --> 06:54.413
something, man.

06:54.447 --> 06:56.414
The red one sucks.

06:58.115 --> 07:00.249
Fry Man, we made you this.

07:00.282 --> 07:01.082
Check it out.

07:01.115 --> 07:02.249
It's a nature necklace.

07:02.282 --> 07:03.956
It's coated with urine.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.090
That we made drinking from a

07:06.123 --> 07:08.024
pure mountain stream.

07:08.057 --> 07:08.957
Organic.

07:08.991 --> 07:10.425
Bro-han, let us put our

07:10.458 --> 07:12.526
differences aside and throw down

07:12.559 --> 07:13.325
mighty.

07:13.358 --> 07:14.726
Oh, like them?

07:14.759 --> 07:16.026
Oh, they're just getting

07:16.059 --> 07:17.860
jiggy with it.

07:17.894 --> 07:19.927
We rule Hollywood.

07:19.960 --> 07:20.827
No, thanks.

07:20.860 --> 07:22.228
Come on, man.

07:22.261 --> 07:23.395
Don't be a nerd.

07:23.428 --> 07:24.095
Yeah, come on, man.

07:24.128 --> 07:25.129
Rock out with us, man.

07:25.161 --> 07:25.861
Come on and go...

07:27.029 --> 07:28.997
outside, out here, in nature.

07:29.030 --> 07:29.862
Rock 'n' Roll!

07:29.897 --> 07:30.963
Away from your possessions

07:30.998 --> 07:32.298
which are worth things.

07:32.331 --> 07:33.031
Uh-huh.

07:33.063 --> 07:33.831
So, that's your plan this time,

07:33.864 --> 07:34.631
right?

07:34.664 --> 07:35.599
Get me so high so you can take

07:35.632 --> 07:37.064
all my stuff.

07:37.098 --> 07:38.199
No, man.

07:38.232 --> 07:43.066
Where is the trust these days?

07:43.100 --> 07:45.467
Fat Man, do you desire the herb?

07:45.501 --> 07:46.168
No, no, no.

07:46.202 --> 07:46.868
I'm not a druggy.

07:46.901 --> 07:49.602
I don't buy that stuff.

07:49.635 --> 07:50.803
I mean, I'll do it if somebody,

07:50.836 --> 07:51.803
like, passes it to me,

07:51.836 --> 07:52.936
or whatever.

07:52.969 --> 07:54.436
Like that time I saw Styx at the

07:54.469 --> 07:57.405
garden with the big Mr. Roboto.

07:57.437 --> 07:58.738
Oh, man!

07:58.770 --> 08:00.737
I got so arrested

08:00.771 --> 08:02.245
that night.

08:02.278 --> 08:03.511
Why, you got some?

08:03.545 --> 08:04.446
No.

08:04.479 --> 08:06.413
But he has a lot of it.

08:06.447 --> 08:07.379
Hey, Fry Man!

08:07.412 --> 08:08.913
What's going on, man?

08:08.947 --> 08:12.748
Nothing.

08:12.781 --> 08:15.140
All of this is ours!

08:19.916 --> 08:21.416
I don't see anything I want,

08:21.450 --> 08:22.217
err.

08:22.251 --> 08:23.117
Yeah, me neither.

08:23.150 --> 08:24.317
Burn it to the ground so

08:24.351 --> 08:27.652
others may not have it either.

08:27.685 --> 08:29.019
This dude back where I worked

08:29.053 --> 08:31.253
at a styrofoam peanut factory,

08:31.286 --> 08:33.119
like, he converted the toilet

08:33.153 --> 08:34.486
into, like, a bong.

08:34.520 --> 08:35.486
And you just sort of put your

08:35.520 --> 08:37.120
face over the seat.

08:37.154 --> 08:38.888
It was pretty bad-ass!

08:38.921 --> 08:39.755
I went in there.

08:39.788 --> 08:41.389
Someone had used the number two.

08:41.422 --> 08:43.756
So, I fish it out, load it up.

08:43.789 --> 08:44.757
You gotta do something to get

08:44.790 --> 08:45.990
through that shift.

08:46.023 --> 08:47.958
Later on when I became an adult,

08:47.991 --> 08:48.890
I was thinking, you know, that's

08:48.923 --> 08:49.758
gross.

08:49.791 --> 08:50.724
But, man, that--

08:50.759 --> 08:52.124
that bathroom was so awesome in

08:52.158 --> 08:54.859
high school.

08:54.892 --> 08:56.159
So, what's this, like a big

08:56.192 --> 08:57.060
hookah or something?

08:57.093 --> 08:57.960
Sure.

08:57.993 --> 08:58.661
Just put your head under that

08:58.694 --> 08:59.761
dome.

08:59.794 --> 09:01.894
We're gonna get high tonight.

09:01.927 --> 09:03.501
Put in some Styx.

09:03.534 --> 09:04.734
Like "Paradise Theater."

09:04.767 --> 09:05.936
Uh, no!

09:05.968 --> 09:07.035
"Kilroy was here!"

09:07.968 --> 09:08.702
You got that digital

09:08.736 --> 09:09.636
remastered...

09:09.669 --> 09:10.369
you guys find what you

09:10.403 --> 09:11.037
needed?

09:11.070 --> 09:11.737
Yes, we did.

09:11.770 --> 09:12.704
Thanks for asking.

09:12.737 --> 09:13.370
Come on, man.

09:13.404 --> 09:14.170
You sure you don't want to hit

09:14.204 --> 09:14.971
that?

09:15.005 --> 09:15.870
...Any classic Styx.

09:15.904 --> 09:16.705
I'm sure.

09:16.738 --> 09:17.538
Or the Dennis DeYoung solo

09:17.571 --> 09:18.705
album--"Desert Moon."

09:18.738 --> 09:19.572
You got that?

09:19.606 --> 09:20.706
Can we come in?

09:20.739 --> 09:22.373
Play with your things?

09:22.407 --> 09:23.139
No.

09:23.172 --> 09:24.340
Harsh.

09:24.373 --> 09:25.240
Why do you guys always come

09:25.273 --> 09:26.407
down here and mess with us?

09:26.440 --> 09:27.541
There's, like, 50 billion people

09:27.574 --> 09:28.474
on this planet.

09:28.508 --> 09:30.608
There are?

09:30.642 --> 09:31.509
Since when?

09:31.542 --> 09:33.476
Long time.

09:33.510 --> 09:34.210
How long?

09:34.243 --> 09:35.310
Very long.

09:35.343 --> 09:36.643
Why don't you invite us in

09:36.676 --> 09:37.511
and teach us.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.477
We didn't have fathers growing

09:39.511 --> 09:40.377
up.

09:40.411 --> 09:41.277
You didn't have a father?

09:41.312 --> 09:42.745
No!

09:42.778 --> 09:44.012
Wow.

09:44.045 --> 09:45.078
I mean, that's...

09:45.112 --> 09:46.345
Actually kind of sad.

09:46.379 --> 09:47.979
I never learned how to steal

09:48.013 --> 09:50.614
or fight or drink the right way.

09:50.647 --> 09:51.414
My dad left home

09:51.447 --> 09:52.480
when I was 3.

09:52.514 --> 09:54.548
Told my mom he couldn't take it,

09:54.581 --> 09:56.048
it meaning me.

09:56.081 --> 09:57.415
And he was the alcoholic.

09:57.448 --> 09:58.115
Moonaholic.

09:58.148 --> 09:58.849
Whatever.

09:58.882 --> 10:00.550
I mean, dependent on Moonohol.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.090
And then one day, man, my mom,

10:02.123 --> 10:03.357
she drops me off at summer camp,

10:03.390 --> 10:05.258
and she says, "see you later--

10:05.290 --> 10:06.158
forever."

10:06.191 --> 10:07.558
And she just drives off.

10:07.591 --> 10:09.759
I--ever since then, man, I've

10:09.792 --> 10:10.592
just been depressed.

10:10.625 --> 10:11.459
Everything I do is for

10:11.492 --> 10:12.159
attention.

10:12.192 --> 10:12.993
That's why I steal.

10:13.026 --> 10:13.760
I mean, look at this.

10:13.793 --> 10:14.461
I stole this.

10:14.493 --> 10:16.493
What am I gonna do with this?

10:16.526 --> 10:17.961
I just really just--you know, I

10:17.994 --> 10:19.827
just miss my dad...

10:19.861 --> 10:20.962
And I don't know where my mom

10:20.995 --> 10:21.628
went.

10:21.662 --> 10:22.795
And...

10:22.828 --> 10:24.096
Man...

10:24.129 --> 10:25.028
No one really wants to be

10:25.062 --> 10:26.997
around.

10:27.029 --> 10:29.064
And that's what makes me cry.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.931
Well, if you want attention,

10:33.965 --> 10:35.532
I could maybe...

10:35.566 --> 10:37.566
Suggest you,

10:37.599 --> 10:38.633
go to L.A.,

10:38.667 --> 10:40.367
try to be a movie star.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.400
It's easy to do.

10:41.434 --> 10:42.068
We know that.

10:42.101 --> 10:42.768
We've been there.

10:42.801 --> 10:45.801
And we will.

10:48.101 --> 10:49.235
When does the get high part

10:49.270 --> 10:50.269
start?

10:50.302 --> 10:51.036
Shh, shh!

10:51.070 --> 10:52.036
Here it comes, here it comes.

10:52.069 --> 10:53.771
This is his scene.

10:53.804 --> 10:55.171
That's not him at all.

10:55.204 --> 10:56.537
That is totally him!

10:56.572 --> 10:58.104
He was clean-shaven, ok?

10:58.137 --> 10:59.205
Oh, you just got lost in his

10:59.238 --> 11:00.238
character here.

11:00.272 --> 11:01.005
Run!

11:01.038 --> 11:01.873
Get out of there, man!

11:01.906 --> 11:02.466
Run.

11:02.466 --> 11:03.132
Run.

11:03.165 --> 11:04.297
This guy is bad news.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.528
This where I go to kill them

11:05.561 --> 11:06.793
gay prostitutes?

11:06.826 --> 11:07.458
Oh, man.

11:07.492 --> 11:08.124
Don't say yes.

11:08.157 --> 11:09.123
Don't say yes.

11:09.156 --> 11:11.252
Dude, don't do it.

11:11.286 --> 11:11.918
Yes.

11:11.951 --> 11:12.717
Oh!

11:12.750 --> 11:13.416
Damn it!

11:13.449 --> 11:14.415
Man!

11:14.447 --> 11:15.480
F-finger puppets

11:15.513 --> 11:18.242
f-f-f-finger puppets

11:18.276 --> 11:20.772
f-finger puppets

11:20.805 --> 11:23.967
f-f-f-f-finger puppets

11:24.000 --> 11:26.097
f-f-finger puppets
