WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:03.046
<i>Previously on</i> Dynasty... I'll be moving

00:03.090 --> 00:05.396
-into La Mirage.
-Maybe you can get
adjoining suites

00:05.440 --> 00:07.007
with Cristal
and her new boyfriend.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.225
<i>I suppose</i>

00:08.269 --> 00:09.922
I could take over
as your therapist.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.315
But for PT only--

00:11.359 --> 00:13.709
I'm not moving back in,
and we're not back together.

00:13.752 --> 00:16.016
This divorce is going
to get very ugly.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.278
I offered you this house

00:17.321 --> 00:18.975
in our settlement
as a goodwill gesture.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.064
But as long as we're still
married, I own half of it.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.805
And I'm moving in
until this is settled.

00:26.156 --> 00:27.244
Ooh...

00:27.288 --> 00:29.377
I am hitting the gym
when we get home.

00:29.420 --> 00:30.900
Two weeks of eating like this,

00:30.943 --> 00:32.510
isn't good for
the six-pack.
Well, I thought

00:32.554 --> 00:33.816
the whole point
of being married

00:33.859 --> 00:35.426
is that you don't have
to work out anymore.

00:35.470 --> 00:38.168
Or we can turn this plane around
and go back to the Maldives

00:38.212 --> 00:39.778
for <i>Part Deux.</i>

00:39.822 --> 00:41.998
As much as your sexy knowledge
of French tempts me,

00:42.042 --> 00:43.782
we can't avoid reality forever.

00:43.826 --> 00:47.221
-And for once, I don't want to.
-Because being
married to me

00:47.264 --> 00:48.396
is the happiest
you've ever been?

00:48.439 --> 00:49.875
Yes, that,

00:49.919 --> 00:51.964
and because of this
national TV interview

00:52.008 --> 00:53.575
with Meredith Prescott
that we're doing

00:53.618 --> 00:55.446
as one of America's
newest power couples.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.318
-You were serious about that?
-Liam,

00:57.361 --> 00:58.406
we're in crisis.

00:58.449 --> 00:59.668
Carrington Atlantic going under.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.104
Blake losing the manor.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.019
Our wedding
turning into a crime scene.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.065
I need a platform
to shoot down these rumors

01:05.108 --> 01:07.589
that the Carrington dynasty
is imploding.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.591
Okay, but is it a problem
that these "rumors"

01:09.634 --> 01:11.114
are actually true?

01:11.158 --> 01:14.117
Yes. Confidence in
Fallon Unlimited is plummeting.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.423
I had a wealth management group

01:15.466 --> 01:16.946
ready to invest
eight figures,

01:16.989 --> 01:18.469
and now they're afraid
to commit.

01:18.513 --> 01:21.951
But once I show everyone
that I'm stronger than ever,

01:21.994 --> 01:23.561
all will be well.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.911
You told me it's an "at home
with the power couples" show,

01:25.955 --> 01:27.435
so does that mean
that we can finally...

01:27.478 --> 01:28.871
No, no, no, no, no.
We discussed this.

01:28.914 --> 01:31.569
The manor is my home,
and now it is yours, too.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.267
Did... we discuss it?

01:33.310 --> 01:35.269
Well, I might have discussed it
for us.

01:35.312 --> 01:37.880
Now, just eat your ice cream
before it melts.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.144
<i>You look great.</i>

01:41.188 --> 01:42.537
"Great" great,

01:42.580 --> 01:44.843
or great for someone who
got stabbed by a psychopath?

01:44.887 --> 01:47.455
-Ah, I'll go with both.
-Shocking,

01:47.498 --> 01:49.674
'cause I haven't been
out of here in two weeks.

01:49.718 --> 01:50.762
I'm losing my mind.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.199
Tell me something exciting.

01:52.242 --> 01:54.244
I do have some soccer news.

01:54.288 --> 01:56.725
Do you not know
what the word "exciting" means?

01:56.768 --> 01:59.945
The league named me
Owner of the Year.

01:59.989 --> 02:02.209
Oh! Oh, I didn't think
you could pull it off,

02:02.252 --> 02:03.688
but that is exciting!

02:03.732 --> 02:05.212
Congratulations!

02:05.255 --> 02:06.561
What's exciting?

02:06.604 --> 02:08.824
Besides my girlfriend
hugging her ex.

02:09.607 --> 02:10.869
Culhane was just named

02:10.913 --> 02:12.697
the soccer league
Owner of the Year.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.046
Congratulations.

02:14.090 --> 02:15.831
It's a good
thing they voted

02:15.874 --> 02:18.268
before last night's
Atlantix game, though.

02:18.312 --> 02:19.661
Offense couldn't finish.

02:19.704 --> 02:22.229
Defense was terrible
on the counter.

02:22.272 --> 02:25.232
What? I was the team
doctor, remember?

02:25.275 --> 02:27.059
Okay, then, Doctor,

02:27.103 --> 02:29.584
what'd you think about
Victor Diaz's performance?

02:29.627 --> 02:30.846
Wasn't his best showing.

02:30.889 --> 02:31.847
All right, cut him some slack.

02:31.890 --> 02:33.501
Maybe his knee is still hurt

02:33.544 --> 02:36.025
from when those guys shattered
it at La Mirage last year.

02:36.068 --> 02:37.548
His trainer would know
if he was hurt.

02:37.592 --> 02:39.333
Unless Victor lied
to them about it.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.509
Which is why we're gonna have
a little talk about things,

02:41.552 --> 02:43.032
straighten this out.

02:44.338 --> 02:47.210
Classic Owner of the Year move
right there.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.821
How did the rehab go
with Cristal this morning?

02:49.865 --> 02:52.215
Which rehab?
Physical or marital?

02:52.259 --> 02:54.043
I assumed they were
one and the same.

02:54.086 --> 02:56.306
They are.
And they're both improving.

02:56.350 --> 02:57.438
I may even

02:57.481 --> 02:59.222
ask her to move back in.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.224
Which would be fine
if you still owned the manor.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.226
Not to mention
one or two other problems.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.228
-Other problems like what?
-Cristal is aware

03:05.272 --> 03:08.057
that you stole the foundation
money for her clinic.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.885
And I've heard a rumor
that Father Caleb

03:09.928 --> 03:12.366
has been visiting her often

03:12.409 --> 03:13.845
at La Mirage.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.369
Well, then I'm just gonna have
to up my game.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.849
-Mm.
-Find another way to get
more time with her.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.722
When I turn it on,
no one can resist that old...

03:20.765 --> 03:22.158
Blake magic.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.116
Check.

03:24.943 --> 03:27.555
You know,
speaking of checking...

03:27.598 --> 03:29.731
have you found
my long-lost friend yet?

03:29.774 --> 03:31.646
Sadly, he remains hidden.

03:32.734 --> 03:33.952
Eastern Europe is not small.

03:33.996 --> 03:37.042
I need you to find him. Soon.

03:38.957 --> 03:41.395
Well, I guess that one
goes down as a draw.

03:41.438 --> 03:43.266
Fourth one in a row.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.401
We really need to discuss
our grand entrance

03:47.444 --> 03:49.098
for this interview.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.143
Oh, welcome back,

03:51.187 --> 03:53.276
newlyweds.
It's good to have you home.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.539
-I have so many questions.
-I only have one.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.106
Why is there an office

03:57.149 --> 03:58.847
set up in the foyer
of my house?

03:58.890 --> 03:59.978
Yeah, that was mine.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.284
Well, because I live here now.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.677
Your mother

04:02.720 --> 04:03.852
double-crossed me,

04:03.895 --> 04:05.419
so I amended
our divorce settlement,

04:05.462 --> 04:08.422
and I won't be moving out
-until she signs it.
-Well,

04:08.465 --> 04:10.772
even if that made sense,
there are dozens of rooms

04:10.815 --> 04:12.774
in this house that
you could set up in.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.428
I mean, I literally
have an office

04:14.471 --> 04:16.212
and a sewing room upstairs

04:16.256 --> 04:18.388
-that I've never even seen.
-Well, I need to pressure
your mother.

04:18.432 --> 04:21.435
That way she'll agree
to our divorce faster,
and I can go home.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.088
Okay, putting the fact

04:23.132 --> 04:24.960
that we are now living
in a sitcom aside,

04:25.003 --> 04:26.875
Liam and I have an
important TV interview

04:26.918 --> 04:29.138
that we are doing
from this very room...

04:29.181 --> 04:30.487
[phone buzzing]...tomorrow,

04:30.531 --> 04:32.010
so if you could just
move everything out of...

04:32.054 --> 04:33.534
Sorry, hang on one sec.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.449
Oh, I need to take this.

04:35.492 --> 04:37.625
Something big is about
to go down in this office.

04:37.668 --> 04:40.149
Not an office.

04:40.192 --> 04:42.020
This is all insane,
especially when jet-lagged,

04:42.064 --> 04:44.327
so I'll be asleep,
dreaming of the Maldives.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.157
I lost my connection.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.290
What happened to the Wi-Fi?

04:50.333 --> 04:52.379
I was just playing
with my new toy.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.902
It's called a Wi-Fi jammer.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.686
Could that have ended your call?

04:55.730 --> 04:57.297
I'm so sorry

04:57.340 --> 04:58.428
for your loss...

04:58.472 --> 04:59.821
of signal.

05:00.822 --> 05:02.040
Welcome home, sweetheart.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.520
I want to hear everything
about your trip.

05:03.564 --> 05:05.174
I mean, clearly,

05:05.217 --> 05:07.394
I've stepped
-into an alternate reality.
-Alexis,

05:07.437 --> 05:08.482
you turn that thing off.

05:08.525 --> 05:09.787
Happily.

05:09.831 --> 05:12.050
Simply agree
to my new divorce terms,

05:12.094 --> 05:14.749
including more cash
and restarting excavation

05:14.792 --> 05:16.359
on the diamond mine.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.883
Then you can move back
into your own mansion

05:18.927 --> 05:20.232
with your own
private office

05:20.276 --> 05:22.365
and close all the deals
that you want.

05:22.409 --> 05:25.194
I'm not doing anything
until you agree to my terms.

05:25.237 --> 05:28.023
Which include not a penny
for excavation.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.677
Fine.

05:29.720 --> 05:30.852
You win.

05:30.895 --> 05:31.940
Really?

05:31.983 --> 05:34.203
Yes. Here's
your signed deal.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.467
-Really? Alexis, stop.
-Oh,

05:37.511 --> 05:39.513
I just love it
-when it snows in Georgia.
-Stop. This is ridiculous.

05:39.556 --> 05:40.775
Damn it, Alexis!

05:40.818 --> 05:42.472
Cut it out!

05:42.516 --> 05:44.474
Oh, and here's
-paragraph two.
-Cut it out right now.

05:44.518 --> 05:45.736
-Stop.
-Hey.

05:45.780 --> 05:47.956
Hey, you...

05:47.999 --> 05:49.610
are the head
of this family.

05:49.653 --> 05:52.134
Do something. This can't be
going on during my interview.

05:52.177 --> 05:53.657
I am absolutely
doing something.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.659
I am moving out. Later.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.531
What? No, no,
no, no, no.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.010
You can't just leave.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.969
Don't worry,
I'm sure it'll work out.

06:01.012 --> 06:02.710
If it doesn't, don't call me.

06:02.753 --> 06:03.711
You're ruining
my suit!

06:03.754 --> 06:04.799
See you at Thanksgiving.

06:04.842 --> 06:06.235
No.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.423
Anders.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.382
Is everything okay?

06:22.425 --> 06:24.427
Peachy. I just stopped by

06:24.471 --> 06:26.298
to introduce your new neighbor.

06:26.342 --> 06:29.040
You remember
Blake Carrington.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.694
Hello, Cristal.

06:31.652 --> 06:34.437
Does one of you want to explain
what's going on here?

06:34.481 --> 06:37.222
I just moved out of the manor
and into La Mirage.

06:37.266 --> 06:39.181
In fact, I haven't eaten yet.

06:39.224 --> 06:41.226
Can I join you? I hear
the sea bass is excellent.

06:41.270 --> 06:42.445
The chive
velouté sauce

06:42.489 --> 06:44.186
has quite a kick.

06:44.229 --> 06:46.014
I'm meeting someone.

06:46.057 --> 06:47.581
But thank you.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.626
No-no problem.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.236
I'm not here to bother you,

06:51.280 --> 06:52.977
I promise.
But, uh,

06:53.021 --> 06:57.025
I'll be on the penthouse floor
if... if you want to bother me.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.942
Yeah, I'll be
on the third floor,

07:00.985 --> 07:03.423
junior suite, if you need me.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.166
Hi.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.430
Was that Blake
that I just saw leaving?

07:10.473 --> 07:11.953
Yes, it was.

07:11.996 --> 07:13.607
I'm guessing that

07:13.650 --> 07:16.653
you didn't take the opportunity
to tell him about us.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.788
I told you, I will tell him
once his PT is done,

07:20.831 --> 07:24.008
-which will be soon.
-Mm.

07:24.835 --> 07:27.577
He's actually moving in here.

07:27.621 --> 07:30.014
What?
He has nowhere
to live.

07:30.058 --> 07:32.713
And he said he's not here
to bother me.

07:32.756 --> 07:33.801
Well, that's exactly
what someone

07:33.844 --> 07:36.107
who is gonna bother you
would say.

07:37.108 --> 07:38.806
He's manipulating you.

07:40.111 --> 07:41.591
Listen.

07:42.897 --> 07:44.681
You don't need to worry
about Blake.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.379
I want to be with you.

07:48.337 --> 07:50.774
I just... need a little time.

07:53.647 --> 07:54.735
Open it.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.520
Sam, you did not need
to do this.

07:57.564 --> 08:00.697
Of course I did. It's our
two-week video chat anniversary.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.960
Yeah, I don't think
that's a thing.

08:03.004 --> 08:05.354
Look, I just wanted
to do something nice for you,

08:05.397 --> 08:08.183
and something that would help us
feel more connected.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.490
Okay.

08:11.534 --> 08:15.016
Okay, that is a White Stilton
Gold Cheese from the UK,

08:15.059 --> 08:17.888
with flecks of edible gold leaf.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.760
And yeah, it's
pricey, but, again,

08:19.803 --> 08:21.109
you're eating gold, so...

08:21.152 --> 08:23.546
A-And it pairs really well
with that bottle

08:23.590 --> 08:26.070
of Bordeaux
I had flown in from France.

08:26.114 --> 08:28.551
And I know what you're thinking,
but don't worry.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.728
I have a matching set.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.251
Look, Sam,

08:33.295 --> 08:35.732
you really got to stop
sending me expensive gifts

08:35.776 --> 08:37.560
every day-- it's kind of...

08:37.604 --> 08:39.170
making me uncomfortable.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.955
Maybe just, um,

08:40.998 --> 08:43.566
just dial it back
a little bit, yeah?

08:44.393 --> 08:46.395
No, I, uh, I hear you.

08:46.438 --> 08:48.136
I can get a little carried away.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.877
But this is the last one,

08:49.920 --> 08:51.008
I promise.

08:51.052 --> 08:52.662
Okay. Well, thank you.

08:53.489 --> 08:55.143
I have to get back to you
in a second.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.145
I have to call the,
uh, New Orleans zoo

08:57.188 --> 08:58.450
to cancel something.

08:59.713 --> 09:03.325
Completely unrelated
to this conversation.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.327
<i>Why are you
so stressed out about this?</i>

09:05.370 --> 09:08.112
This interview is meant
to restore faith in my brand,

09:08.156 --> 09:10.593
to show that international
wealth management group

09:10.637 --> 09:12.508
that <i>alles is gut
and Fallon Carrington</i>

09:12.552 --> 09:13.683
is a name to be trusted.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.163
But it can't happen
if Jeff

09:15.206 --> 09:17.339
and Alexis are fighting
to the death in the foyer.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.341
Hey, well, have you thought
about moving the interview

09:19.384 --> 09:20.647
to somewhere more stable?

09:20.690 --> 09:22.257
Like the <i>Titanic?</i>

09:22.300 --> 09:25.042
This interview is about
power couples in their homes,

09:25.086 --> 09:26.522
so moving it
somewhere else

09:26.566 --> 09:27.915
would be a sign of instability.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.134
All right, so we can't move it,

09:30.178 --> 09:32.049
but we... can't have it here?

09:32.093 --> 09:34.704
No, we can have it here once
I get those two to work it out

09:34.748 --> 09:37.489
like any normal couple divorcing
from a sham marriage.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.798
-Never mind that.
-Oh...

09:41.842 --> 09:43.104
it's Lucy.

09:43.147 --> 09:45.193
Just stay right over there.
That's your line.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.195
You can't come over here
without a passport.

09:47.238 --> 09:49.676
Everything is so much easier
in sitcoms.

09:49.719 --> 09:53.201
A half hour,
and all your problems disappear.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.683
Honey, I'm home.

09:56.726 --> 09:57.945
Hi, darling.

09:57.988 --> 10:00.382
I'm just getting
to my light dusting.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.863
Whoa. What's that on your neck?

10:02.906 --> 10:06.518
Jewelry. Which you'd know
if you ever bought me a present.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.870
How much did that
little trinket cost?

10:09.913 --> 10:12.176
Whatever they charged
your credit card.

10:13.395 --> 10:15.049
It's part of our
deal, remember?

10:15.092 --> 10:18.052
If you're going to be a slob,
I get to buy whatever I want.

10:18.095 --> 10:20.010
Well, I don't remember
signing that deal.

10:20.054 --> 10:22.447
It's probably underneath
all that mess over there.

10:22.491 --> 10:23.797
Oh, it's not a mess.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.147
I know exactly where
everything is.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.235
So do I.

10:27.278 --> 10:28.497
On the floor.

10:31.195 --> 10:34.155
Ah. Sorry we're late.

10:34.198 --> 10:38.072
This one couldn't get
off the phone with his mother.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.377
Why do you hate my mother?

10:39.421 --> 10:42.598
Yeah, I know.
-Dumb question.
-Oh.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.382
What happened here?

10:44.426 --> 10:46.950
Did a tornado blow through and
touch down in your living room?

10:46.994 --> 10:50.562
No. My husband's just
decided to live in filth.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.695
No, your husband can
live however he wants.

10:52.739 --> 10:55.132
A man's home is his manor.

10:55.176 --> 10:57.265
Hey, now, hold on a sec.

10:57.308 --> 10:59.049
I might not be Alfred Einstein,

10:59.093 --> 11:02.966
but I think
I can solve this problem.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.448
That's your clean side
over there.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.145
This is Jeff's messy side
over here.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.234
All you have to do
is stay on your own sides.

11:10.278 --> 11:11.453
Problem solved.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.803
Oh. Finally, some
peace in here.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.457
Oh, speaking of peace,
I could go for a piece

11:15.500 --> 11:17.372
of that famous
Colby Coconut Cream Pie

11:17.415 --> 11:19.809
-you sell at the club.
-Now you're talking, neighbor.
It's in the kitchen.

11:19.853 --> 11:23.683
Uh-uh-uh. Kitchen is
on my side, darling.

11:23.726 --> 11:26.294
The beluga-albino caviar

11:26.337 --> 11:29.036
you special ordered
from the Caspian Sea.

11:29.079 --> 11:30.385
Well, it took you
long enough.

11:30.428 --> 11:31.560
Next time, I'll
travel there myself

11:31.603 --> 11:32.909
and pack it by hand.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.563
-Hmm.
Oh,

11:34.606 --> 11:36.173
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.392
The caviar's on my side.

11:37.435 --> 11:39.742
Enjoy those empty plates.

11:40.438 --> 11:43.267
Enjoy eating
with your hands.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.793
While you two may
be at a stalemate,

11:46.836 --> 11:49.839
somebody should eat those
little fish eggs. You hungry,

11:49.883 --> 11:51.275
big boy?

11:51.319 --> 11:52.407
A little champagne?

11:52.450 --> 11:55.323
A lot of champagne.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.547
Hmm.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.898
Mother, the red zones are yours.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.595
Jeff, you are the green.

12:06.638 --> 12:09.467
Just stay in your zones,
and all will be well.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.426
You expect me
to be confined to a zone

12:11.469 --> 12:12.862
like some sort of grazing cow?

12:12.906 --> 12:15.125
If the grass fits...

12:15.169 --> 12:16.344
What's up
with these yellow zones?

12:16.387 --> 12:17.649
Shared zones.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.260
So, each of you
will get a schedule

12:19.303 --> 12:20.435
with predetermined

12:20.478 --> 12:21.784
time slots for those.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.395
Strictly off-limits
during my interview.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.789
So I can't go certain places
in my own house?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.051
-<i>Our</i> house.
Look,

12:28.095 --> 12:29.792
I just need
a temporary cease-fire,

12:29.836 --> 12:30.575
okay?

12:30.619 --> 12:31.881
So, just please try

12:31.925 --> 12:34.841
to leave each other alone
for 24 hours,

12:34.884 --> 12:36.712
and it'll be great for everyone.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.148
Or we could sit down

12:38.192 --> 12:40.629
and work it out right now.
You want to do that?

12:42.631 --> 12:43.719
No, I didn't think so.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.112
So, go to your zones
and stay there.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.375
Can my red zone be
more of a burgundy?

12:47.418 --> 12:48.985
It feels richer.

12:49.029 --> 12:50.726
Go!

12:53.337 --> 12:54.730
<i>So,</i>

12:54.774 --> 12:57.602
Meredith is just gonna ask you
some basic questions.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.039
Who does what
in the relationship,

12:59.082 --> 13:00.736
how you attack
the world together.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.085
Just that sort of thing.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.435
And where do you
want to do the actual interview?

13:04.479 --> 13:05.915
Oh, Liam and I are planning

13:05.959 --> 13:07.830
on descending the
staircase together,

13:07.874 --> 13:09.701
taking a quick tour
of the grounds

13:09.745 --> 13:11.703
and then winding up here,
actually,

13:11.747 --> 13:13.183
-for the interview.
-Perfect.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.185
And your home is magnificent.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.535
Calm, too. Meredith likes calm.

13:17.579 --> 13:22.149
Well, I insist upon calm.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.672
Calmly, you know.
Yeah.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.500
What?

13:25.543 --> 13:26.806
-What's that?
-What's what?

13:28.895 --> 13:30.026
Oh.

13:30.070 --> 13:34.161
Uh... Well, we
sometimes use drones

13:34.204 --> 13:38.513
in the manor to complete
basic tasks. You know.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.384
It provides
a sense of tranquility,

13:40.428 --> 13:41.864
don't you think?

13:41.908 --> 13:43.431
Uh,

13:43.474 --> 13:45.433
-is that normal?
-Uh...

13:52.483 --> 13:54.094
How dare you

13:54.137 --> 13:55.399
incinerate my proposal?

13:55.443 --> 13:57.010
How dare you even make

13:57.053 --> 13:58.272
that proposal?

13:58.315 --> 13:59.490
Okay.

13:59.534 --> 14:00.883
Red and green zones only!

14:00.927 --> 14:02.972
There is no parking
in the yellow zone.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.801
You still haven't
settled this?

14:05.845 --> 14:06.889
Who the hell is that?

14:06.933 --> 14:08.282
Dominique Deveraux.

14:08.325 --> 14:09.849
-Charmed.
-Crazy woman.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.285
You're behaving

14:11.328 --> 14:12.503
like a child, Jeff.

14:12.547 --> 14:14.331
You need to forgive
my mild duplicity

14:14.375 --> 14:17.552
and move on so we can all
get rich off our diamonds.

14:17.595 --> 14:18.553
Hmm.

14:18.596 --> 14:19.684
Can nobody read a grid?

14:19.728 --> 14:20.816
Is everybody colorblind?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.165
Why are you being
so difficult?

14:22.209 --> 14:23.645
I didn't raise you
like this.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.690
This doesn't concern you, okay?

14:25.734 --> 14:27.605
And I don't remember
you raising me at all.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.694
Just sign the papers, Jeff.

14:29.738 --> 14:32.349
No. You sign them. <i>You</i> sign them!

14:32.393 --> 14:33.916
No, <i>you</i> sign them!

14:33.960 --> 14:35.396
Oh, so, this isn't gonna work.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.659
I can't subject Meredith
to this sort of atmosphere.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.487
No, no, no, no, no.
This is not the atmosphere.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.532
This is a glitch
in the atmosphere.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.839
Sorry. The interview's off.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.061
Mother.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.977
Stepfather.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.414
Stepgrandmother.

14:53.457 --> 14:54.458
I just want

14:54.502 --> 14:56.112
to personally thank
all of you

14:56.156 --> 14:58.462
for ruining everything.

15:09.865 --> 15:12.215
Hey, there he is.

15:12.259 --> 15:14.304
Now, see? Isn't this
so much better?

15:14.348 --> 15:15.958
Just the two of us talking.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.742
You don't have
to tell me twice.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.353
You don't want me
sending you packages,

15:19.396 --> 15:21.398
I'm not
sending you packages.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.966
I didn't mean to
sound ungrateful.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.533
It's just
that we're both so busy,

15:25.576 --> 15:27.578
I-I didn't want to spend
our time online

15:27.622 --> 15:29.319
opening presents.

15:29.363 --> 15:30.886
Of course not.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.107
Which is why today's present

15:34.150 --> 15:36.239
is appearing from home.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.719
What do you mean?

15:37.762 --> 15:39.851
Say hello to Brian Littrell.

15:39.895 --> 15:42.202
What's up, Sam?

15:42.245 --> 15:45.031
And you must be Ryan.
It's nice to meet you.

15:45.074 --> 15:46.989
Can someone explain
what's happening here?

15:47.033 --> 15:50.471
Well, uh, video calls
can get a little stale,

15:50.514 --> 15:52.125
and I wanted
to keep things fresh,

15:52.168 --> 15:54.083
so I hired Brian
to do a few songs

15:54.127 --> 15:55.737
for us. I've been a huge fan

15:55.780 --> 15:57.521
since the Backstreet Boys days.

15:57.565 --> 15:59.697
Okay, Bri. Let's do it.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.468
Well, keep singing.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.644
I paid a lot of money
for three songs.

16:33.688 --> 16:36.125
Well, don't you think
that's a little awkward?

16:36.169 --> 16:39.650
Do you really think it can get
more awkward than this?

16:39.694 --> 16:41.522
Good point.

<i>So, why am I here?</i>

16:49.182 --> 16:50.487
I brought Victor
in this morning

16:50.531 --> 16:51.662
to see if I could
get him to sit out

16:51.706 --> 16:53.099
a few games to
rest his knee.

16:53.142 --> 16:54.926
He admit that it was hurting
the last few games

16:54.970 --> 16:56.624
but says it's fine now.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.017
Well, you got
to admire his fortitude.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.193
I don't think
he's telling the truth.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.238
Do me a favor.
Watch him from the other night.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.197
...his, uh, injury,
but they don't...

17:04.240 --> 17:06.155
Does it look like his
knee is bothering him?

17:06.199 --> 17:08.940
The more I watch,
-the less I'm buying it.
-What,

17:08.984 --> 17:10.029
because he's outrunning
every player

17:10.072 --> 17:12.466
on both teams like a gazelle?

17:12.509 --> 17:14.250
Yeah, he looks perfectly fit.

17:14.294 --> 17:15.599
I think he's lying to you.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.079
Probably to make

17:17.123 --> 17:18.646
an excuse for having a bad game.

17:18.689 --> 17:21.257
That's the problem.
This is the third game in a row

17:21.301 --> 17:22.780
that he's done fine
in the first half

17:22.824 --> 17:24.130
and missed easy chances

17:24.173 --> 17:25.696
in the second.
Hmm.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.089
I got a bad feeling

17:27.133 --> 17:29.439
he's involved
with dangerous people again.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.311
Maybe even throwing games.

17:32.660 --> 17:33.704
I may have to go
to the commissioner.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.097
Look, that's a big swing

17:35.141 --> 17:37.534
and a serious charge
you're making.

17:37.578 --> 17:38.579
You better be right,

17:38.622 --> 17:40.059
and you better have proof,

17:40.102 --> 17:41.625
or the commissioner's
gonna be looking

17:41.669 --> 17:43.018
for a new Owner of the Year.

17:46.717 --> 17:49.285
What do you want? I got my own
problems going on right now.

17:49.329 --> 17:50.982
Which I am totally willing
to listen to.

17:51.026 --> 17:54.290
Okay. Well, Ryan and I
had a really bad FaceTime.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.335
I didn't mean now.

17:55.378 --> 17:56.684
Look, my interview

17:56.727 --> 17:59.208
was canceled, and I need
your help to uncancel it.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.428
Really? Well,
I don't feel like going

18:01.471 --> 18:03.169
on some crazy escapade
tonight, so...

18:03.212 --> 18:05.171
Oh, come on. Can you imagine

18:05.214 --> 18:07.521
if Ethel had said that to Lucy?

18:10.045 --> 18:12.830
Okay. Fine. I'll do it.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.005
But only if I can be Lucy.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.442
You can be Lucy.

18:15.485 --> 18:18.314
Meet me downstairs
in two minutes. Ethel.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.796
Personally,

18:21.839 --> 18:23.624
I think the interview getting
canceled is a great thing.

18:23.667 --> 18:26.235
I mean, yeah, sure, it may
cost you a sizable investment.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.411
Oh, it <i>will</i> cost me
a sizable investment.

18:28.455 --> 18:30.196
Yeah, but your company
will survive.

18:30.239 --> 18:32.111
You don't know that.
And I can't have

18:32.154 --> 18:34.113
my family
dragging me down again.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.898
But you don't need to worry
about that.

18:36.941 --> 18:39.901
You can just sit here
and look pretty.

18:39.944 --> 18:43.383
I will fix this. Fred.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.516
-Ricky?
-There we go.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.790
Okay, you are on watch duty.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.357
You know what she
-looks like, right?
-Yeah.

19:01.401 --> 19:04.926
Okay. So, just say the code word
if you see her coming.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.585
-Anything?
-Well, I just started,

19:11.628 --> 19:13.369
and I haven't found anything
that's labeled

19:13.413 --> 19:15.893
"stuff to blackmail Val with"
yet, so no.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.765
Rude. And this is Val's office,

19:17.808 --> 19:20.246
so it would be labeled
"stuff to blackmail <i>me</i> with."

19:24.598 --> 19:26.861
Cocoa Puffs.

19:26.904 --> 19:29.385
Cocoa Puffs. She's...

19:29.429 --> 19:30.604
She's... Um,

19:30.647 --> 19:32.519
can I help you with something?

19:32.562 --> 19:34.303
Hey. You must be Val.

19:34.347 --> 19:37.219
I'm Sam,
Fallon Carrington's friend.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.960
And, uh,
I'm actually here to help you.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.091
Oh, really?

19:40.135 --> 19:42.442
Yes. I think you should give her

19:42.485 --> 19:44.357
a second chance
for the interview.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.098
And you came all this way
just to tell me that?

19:47.142 --> 19:48.926
How did you even know
where I work?

19:48.970 --> 19:50.319
Oh, Fallon told me.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.234
That's how excited she is
to be doing this.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.714
Uh, look,

19:53.757 --> 19:56.847
I would consider it
a personal favor

19:56.891 --> 19:59.241
even though we don't know
each other, but, uh,

19:59.285 --> 20:01.243
we can get to know each other.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.898
If you know what I mean.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.466
Yeah, I-I don't think so.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.294
You know, I thought
I was gonna eat this,

20:08.337 --> 20:10.296
but I'm not that hungry.

20:10.339 --> 20:11.906
Oh. Uh, so,

20:11.949 --> 20:13.124
can I walk you out?

20:13.168 --> 20:15.692
Sure. And tell your friend
in the trash can

20:15.736 --> 20:17.477
that I'll see her tomorrow.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.177
Really?

20:22.221 --> 20:23.265
How did you know
I was in here?

20:23.309 --> 20:24.962
I saw you two walking in

20:25.006 --> 20:26.442
when I was getting into my car
and figured

20:26.486 --> 20:27.835
something was up.
If you're gonna go

20:27.878 --> 20:30.098
to this much trouble
just for an interview,

20:30.141 --> 20:32.143
you must be crazy.

20:33.101 --> 20:34.624
And crazy makes good TV.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.060
Well, that is great.

20:36.104 --> 20:38.846
I guess, um,
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.674
You might want
to clean up those noodles

20:40.717 --> 20:42.371
-before then.
-Yeah.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.507
You said Cocoa Puffs.

20:47.985 --> 20:49.639
The code word was Cheerios.

20:49.683 --> 20:50.771
Really?

20:50.814 --> 20:54.078
Oh, I had Cocoa Puffs
for breakfast.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.341
Oh, you did?

20:55.384 --> 20:57.256
Did the, uh,
milk get all chocolaty?

20:57.299 --> 20:58.996
-Yeah.
-No!

20:59.040 --> 21:00.259
Please help me out of here.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.261
I'm a literal garbage person.

21:12.706 --> 21:16.144
I'm not sure I can handle eating
breakfast at such a small table.

21:16.187 --> 21:18.929
Just pretend that all
the tables are yours.

21:18.973 --> 21:19.974
And all
the food.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.367
Oh.

21:22.237 --> 21:23.499
That does help a little.

21:23.543 --> 21:25.022
I have good news.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.894
I've found
your long-lost friend.

21:26.937 --> 21:27.938
Oh, fantastic.

21:27.982 --> 21:28.939
What condition is he in?

21:28.983 --> 21:30.506
-Pristine.
-Thank God.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.247
You know,
that Chagall's worth 11 mil.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.336
Well, the gentleman
that you loaned it to

21:34.380 --> 21:36.773
apologizes for the delay
in getting it back to you.

21:36.817 --> 21:39.385
He had to go underground while
sponsoring a regime change...

21:39.428 --> 21:41.256
I'm glad that he could use it
as collateral,

21:41.300 --> 21:42.953
though don't tell me what for.

21:42.997 --> 21:44.346
Plausible deniability.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.740
Now you can sell it,
get back on your feet

21:46.783 --> 21:49.351
and to a table worthy
of your stature.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.222
Oh, the big table
will happen.

21:51.266 --> 21:54.008
But I have more urgent plans
for that money.

21:55.879 --> 21:57.272
So,

21:57.316 --> 21:59.143
how's your phone sex thing

21:59.187 --> 22:00.536
with Ryan going?

22:00.580 --> 22:01.885
I think yesterday you said
something about a problem?

22:01.929 --> 22:04.323
First of all,
it's more than just phone sex.

22:04.366 --> 22:05.846
And, yes,

22:05.889 --> 22:07.413
it's on hold for the moment.

22:07.456 --> 22:09.415
We haven't spoken since
our Brian Littrell incident.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.634
I'm sorry,

22:11.678 --> 22:13.593
there was
a Brian Littrell incident?

22:14.202 --> 22:15.769
Let me guess,
he wanted it that way.

22:15.812 --> 22:17.379
Ha-ha.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.120
But you wouldn't quit
playing games with his heart,

22:19.163 --> 22:20.556
so he said, "Bye bye bye."

22:20.600 --> 22:22.253
One, not funny.

22:22.297 --> 22:24.647
-Fine.
-And, two, that's NSYNC.

22:24.691 --> 22:28.129
-Oh.
-And, yes, I hired
my favorite Backstreet Boy

22:28.172 --> 22:31.175
and first crush to give a
concert in our video chat,

22:31.219 --> 22:33.743
but Ryan bailed before
he even hit the chorus.

22:33.787 --> 22:35.658
Maybe he doesn't
like Brian Littrell?

22:35.702 --> 22:36.920
Which would be weird.

22:36.964 --> 22:40.489
Yeah. Or maybe he thinks
it's weird

22:40.533 --> 22:42.709
that you're throwing concerts
over FaceTime

22:42.752 --> 22:45.059
instead of having an actual
conversation. Because I do.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.713
Well, I'm doing everything
that I can

22:46.756 --> 22:48.149
to show him how into this I am,

22:48.192 --> 22:50.107
and he clearly
doesn't appreciate it.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.109
I mean, anyone can just look
at each other

22:52.153 --> 22:53.546
over a computer screen.

22:53.589 --> 22:55.112
Well, I think
you need to look at yourself.

22:55.156 --> 22:57.463
Okay? Because Ryan
could listen to music anytime.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.682
To be honest, he'd
probably rather hear you sing

22:59.726 --> 23:00.944
than Brian Littrell.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.425
Well, I do have
the voice of an angel.

23:04.774 --> 23:06.733
Interesting.
Thank you.

23:06.776 --> 23:08.082
Sure.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.431
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.433
Hi.

23:13.174 --> 23:15.002
I need five minutes
to decompress.

23:15.045 --> 23:17.439
Mm. Who is it, Alexis or Jeff?

23:17.483 --> 23:21.617
Neither. My mother won't stop
e-mailing me listings of houses

23:21.661 --> 23:24.620
in Buckhead, all within
broom-flying distance

23:24.664 --> 23:26.274
of her house.

23:26.317 --> 23:27.318
Mm.

23:27.362 --> 23:29.451
Well, maybe it's time.

23:29.495 --> 23:30.713
Really?

23:31.714 --> 23:32.759
Are you serious?

23:32.802 --> 23:34.282
Oh, what, time to move out?

23:34.325 --> 23:36.110
No, no. To change your e-mail.

23:37.198 --> 23:38.982
Like this house is any better?

23:39.853 --> 23:41.463
Unless you solved World War III.

23:41.507 --> 23:42.986
-Yeah.
If they're not speaking
to each other,

23:43.030 --> 23:44.553
how did you get 'em
to come here for dinner?

23:44.597 --> 23:47.295
Neither one knows
that the other one is coming.

23:47.338 --> 23:48.601
Oh.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.472
That should be interesting.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.039
There's one
of the lovebirds now.

23:52.082 --> 23:53.475
Yeah, before the evening
is over,

23:53.519 --> 23:55.172
there'll be feathers
flying all over the place.

23:55.216 --> 23:57.610
Now that the
interview is back on,

23:57.653 --> 23:59.612
I am open to ideas.

23:59.655 --> 24:01.483
Maybe I've been thinking
about it all wrong.

24:01.527 --> 24:03.703
Gee, thanks
for setting me up, pal.

24:03.746 --> 24:04.965
You're the best.

24:05.008 --> 24:06.488
I haven't had a date
since my heart attack.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.185
You got to stop
saying that.

24:08.229 --> 24:09.535
Getting your heart broken's
not the same thing

24:09.578 --> 24:10.361
as a heart attack.

24:10.405 --> 24:11.537
Shouldn't you know that?

24:11.580 --> 24:12.538
You're a doctor.

24:12.581 --> 24:13.930
Kinda.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.152
Sue me. I'm romantic.

24:18.195 --> 24:20.502
I think it's
pronounced "pathetic."

24:23.244 --> 24:26.813
Oh! You are going
to fall for him.

24:26.856 --> 24:29.076
I mean, I personally don't
find him attractive,

24:29.119 --> 24:31.078
but we have
different taste in men.

24:31.121 --> 24:32.383
Good versus bad.

24:32.427 --> 24:34.342
What if I'm not
ready to date again?

24:34.385 --> 24:36.083
Well, I wish
you'd mentioned that

24:36.126 --> 24:37.998
before I took my curlers out,
threw a girdle on

24:38.041 --> 24:39.826
and ironed my dress,
but that's okay.

24:41.088 --> 24:43.177
Listen, sweetie,

24:43.220 --> 24:45.266
I know that you might feel
like you're not ready

24:45.309 --> 24:47.137
to date again,
but, trust me,

24:47.181 --> 24:49.139
<i>I</i> am ready
for you to date again.

24:49.183 --> 24:50.750
And that's really
all that matters anyway.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.363
Oh! Come on.

24:55.406 --> 24:56.582
He's waiting
down there somewhere.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.409
Okay, well, don't
go too far away.

24:58.453 --> 25:00.368
Oh, no, no.
I'll be right here,

25:00.411 --> 25:02.936
climbing into a bottle of gin.

25:06.592 --> 25:07.549
Adam?

25:08.594 --> 25:09.638
Kirby?

25:09.682 --> 25:12.249
Well, we'll just
leave you two alone.

25:12.293 --> 25:14.861
But I will
take that.

25:17.428 --> 25:18.778
They think they're so smart.

25:18.821 --> 25:20.910
I know.

25:20.954 --> 25:21.998
Why is that again?

25:22.042 --> 25:24.261
Because they tricked us.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.569
Into showing up at
the same place at the same time

25:27.613 --> 25:30.746
for a blind date
with each other.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.053
Right, right.

25:33.096 --> 25:34.533
Is that why Fallon
told me to dress

25:34.576 --> 25:35.795
the same as I did
for our first date?

25:37.274 --> 25:38.928
I thought it was
because I looked nice.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.582
Well, you do.

25:40.626 --> 25:43.498
So maybe this isn't such
a bad thing after all.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.413
That was a...
pretty good night.

25:45.456 --> 25:48.198
Roses for your lady?

25:48.242 --> 25:49.765
No, thanks.
We're allergic.

25:51.985 --> 25:54.117
Earrings for your lady?

25:56.250 --> 25:57.643
On the house.

26:01.211 --> 26:02.909
I know I said
I'd leave you alone,

26:02.952 --> 26:04.171
but how's it going?

26:04.214 --> 26:05.520
Are you guys back together?

26:05.564 --> 26:07.000
Did the secret plan work?

26:07.043 --> 26:08.567
Ew!

26:08.610 --> 26:11.091
I mean, good for you two,
but...

26:11.134 --> 26:12.092
ew.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.625
-Well?
-Well, what?

26:23.669 --> 26:25.627
Fallon said you were ready
to talk settlement.

26:25.671 --> 26:26.802
What?

26:26.846 --> 26:28.761
She said the same thing
to me about you.

26:29.500 --> 26:32.025
That duplicitous little...

26:32.068 --> 26:33.548
Watch your mouth, Mother.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.984
I don't want to have
to give you a time-out.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.638
What the hell
are you doing?

26:36.682 --> 26:38.988
My interview is imminent,
and I need

26:39.032 --> 26:40.642
the two of you
out of the way.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.557
So I'm not letting you out
until you sign divorce papers--

26:42.601 --> 26:44.951
I don't care whose--
and go your separate ways.

26:46.039 --> 26:47.649
-Okay.
-Fallon,

26:47.693 --> 26:50.260
do not lock us
in here! Th...

26:52.001 --> 26:54.134
Thank you.

26:54.177 --> 26:55.918
You'll need these.

26:55.962 --> 26:57.354
Fallon.

26:57.398 --> 26:59.139
Fallon! Fallon!

27:12.195 --> 27:13.762
-Kirby?
-Oh, my God.

27:13.806 --> 27:14.850
Victor.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.723
Hi!
Okay.

27:18.724 --> 27:20.682
Um, what are you doing here?

27:20.726 --> 27:23.337
I'm meeting someone,
but I don't see him yet.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.860
Want to have a drink with me?

27:24.904 --> 27:27.254
Of course. I just need
to finish something up first,

27:27.297 --> 27:28.298
but I'll meet you at the bar.

27:28.342 --> 27:29.865
Yeah.

27:34.565 --> 27:36.524
I would make an awesome thief.

27:36.567 --> 27:37.568
Indeed.

27:37.612 --> 27:39.396
So, I'll be
in the back.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.529
I just need five minutes
to copy the data from his phone,

27:41.572 --> 27:43.139
see if there's
any evidence of gambling.

27:43.183 --> 27:45.141
But he cannot see me
before that.

27:45.185 --> 27:47.187
So keep him entertained.

27:47.230 --> 27:48.275
Yeah.

27:48.318 --> 27:50.669
I'm awesome at that, too.

27:54.977 --> 27:56.370
So...

27:56.413 --> 27:58.241
it has been a minute, handsome.

27:58.285 --> 28:00.287
I was actually hoping
to run into you here.

28:00.330 --> 28:02.985
And now here you are.

28:03.029 --> 28:04.726
Stop teasing me.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.032
I'm not.

28:06.075 --> 28:07.207
Kirby.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.208
Who's this?

28:08.251 --> 28:10.340
Uh... this is

28:10.384 --> 28:12.168
Victor Diaz.
He plays for the Atlantix.

28:13.387 --> 28:14.518
And you knowhim how?

28:14.562 --> 28:16.956
We're just... old friends.

28:16.999 --> 28:18.653
Yeah, you know
how that goes.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.002
Right, well, I'm
with Kirby now,

28:20.046 --> 28:21.482
so maybe you should keep
your eyes off her ass

28:21.525 --> 28:22.483
and put them
somewhere else.

28:22.526 --> 28:24.354
Excuse me?

28:24.398 --> 28:26.182
Just kidding.

28:26.226 --> 28:27.314
I'm actually a big fan.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.708
I was the team doctor
before you came.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.579
Can I get you a drink?

28:31.622 --> 28:33.407
Yeah?

28:33.450 --> 28:35.365
Let's have a drink.

28:35.409 --> 28:36.845
You know, I should be upset

28:36.889 --> 28:39.630
that we're going
-after J.
-Lo and A-Rod,

28:39.674 --> 28:40.849
but I've decided to spin it

28:40.893 --> 28:43.373
that they are
the warm-up power couple

28:43.417 --> 28:45.419
and we are the main course.

28:45.462 --> 28:46.681
How's that spin working?

28:46.725 --> 28:48.552
Not great.
Have you seen her abs?

28:48.596 --> 28:49.684
Well, you're gonna do great.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.817
And you... look dazzling.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.340
Oh, thank you.

28:53.383 --> 28:54.428
You look...

28:55.603 --> 28:57.431
Do I have time to change
everything you're wearing?

28:57.474 --> 28:58.475
No, I don't.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.390
You look great, too.

29:00.434 --> 29:01.522
Have you seen Jeff?

29:01.565 --> 29:03.045
No, I haven't.

29:03.089 --> 29:05.047
But if I do, I'll be sure
to tell him you forgot to knock.

29:05.091 --> 29:07.223
Mm. I want to show him
this mock-up

29:07.267 --> 29:10.009
of a mother-son brand
I came up with

29:10.052 --> 29:12.228
for when the diamond mine opens.

29:12.272 --> 29:14.143
I call us

29:14.187 --> 29:16.232
"Colbys in Ice."

29:16.276 --> 29:17.494
Hopefully Jeff

29:17.538 --> 29:18.495
will love it so much he'll want

29:18.539 --> 29:19.714
to start digging tonight.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.324
What do you think?

29:21.368 --> 29:25.546
I think he'll probably have
some very strong feelings

29:25.589 --> 29:26.765
about it.
But, again,

29:26.808 --> 29:29.289
I don't know
where he is, so...

29:31.247 --> 29:34.076
It's an absolute miracle
that you, me and Jeff

29:34.120 --> 29:36.818
turned out as well as we did
with egomaniacal mothers

29:36.862 --> 29:38.777
who act like children.

29:38.820 --> 29:41.301
Mm, they should start
a club.

29:42.258 --> 29:45.174
Or we should start
a support group.

29:46.001 --> 29:48.830
So, our last game to qualify for
the World Cup is in three hours.

29:48.874 --> 29:52.094
We're two hours from the
stadium, hungover, no money,

29:52.138 --> 29:55.663
no phones and a car with no
doors that only goes in reverse.

30:02.452 --> 30:04.019
Where's my phone?

30:04.890 --> 30:06.282
I can't find my phone.

30:06.326 --> 30:08.502
Uh, maybe you dropped it
when you were walking in.

30:08.545 --> 30:10.286
Deep breaths.
It's just a phone.

30:10.330 --> 30:11.592
My entire life is on that thing.

30:11.635 --> 30:12.854
I just can't have
some stranger find it.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.769
-Well, let's go outside and look.
-Yeah.

30:18.817 --> 30:22.298
Wait, I-I have a
find-my-phone app on here.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.740
[chimes]
Thank God.
It says it's somewhere in here.

30:31.742 --> 30:32.743
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

30:32.787 --> 30:33.962
It-it looks like you're limping.

30:34.006 --> 30:35.355
Is everything okay?
Can I check it out?

30:35.398 --> 30:37.183
We don't want you hobbling
during the playoffs.

30:37.226 --> 30:38.401
Yeah, is it your knee?

30:38.445 --> 30:40.099
You know, from when they...

30:40.142 --> 30:42.579
I-I'm fine. And I really
don't need you to examine me.

30:42.623 --> 30:43.580
Wait!

30:43.624 --> 30:44.930
Hey. You.

30:44.973 --> 30:46.018
I've been looking
all over for you.

30:46.061 --> 30:47.410
Guess you dropped
your phone.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.283
Shall we finish
that exam?

30:50.326 --> 30:51.675
Don't touch me, bro.

30:51.719 --> 30:53.286
I'll be over there
when you want to talk.

30:54.678 --> 30:56.289
Bye, Victor!

30:56.332 --> 30:57.594
Did you get the proof?

30:57.638 --> 30:59.466
I did. And it looks
like this gambling thing

30:59.509 --> 31:01.903
is much bigger than I expected.

31:02.773 --> 31:05.211
I'm glad you called. I've
been wanting to talk to you.

31:05.254 --> 31:08.040
I wanted to talk to you about
something important as well.

31:08.083 --> 31:11.043
But then I found out the
clinic just got a cash gift

31:11.086 --> 31:13.045
from an anonymous
donor to keep it open.

31:13.088 --> 31:15.003
Really? That's great news.

31:16.048 --> 31:18.572
For someone so good at lying,
you're a terrible actor.

31:18.615 --> 31:21.053
I know it was you.

31:21.096 --> 31:22.706
Well, you weren't supposed
to find out,

31:22.750 --> 31:24.578
but since you did,
you're welcome.

31:24.621 --> 31:26.058
For repaying the money you stole
from the clinic

31:26.101 --> 31:27.320
in the first place?

31:27.363 --> 31:29.452
-How generous.
-Excuse me?

31:29.496 --> 31:32.151
You're doing the same thing
you always do, Blake--

31:32.194 --> 31:34.805
throwing money at your problems
instead of owning them.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.111
I'm currently homeless.

31:36.155 --> 31:37.939
I'm relying on the generosity

31:37.983 --> 31:39.898
of my late wife's nephew
to keep a roof

31:39.941 --> 31:41.247
over my head.
I can use that money.

31:41.290 --> 31:42.639
I think that's a little harsh.

31:42.683 --> 31:44.380
Harsh?

31:44.424 --> 31:46.730
I called your original physical
therapist to get your records

31:46.774 --> 31:48.819
from her, and
after I questioned

31:48.863 --> 31:50.604
her professionalism,
she confessed

31:50.647 --> 31:53.389
that you paid her to do
a bad job in order to trick me.

31:53.433 --> 31:56.131
Mm, I should've paid her
to keep her mouth shut.

31:56.175 --> 31:58.438
I am so sick
of your manipulations, Blake.

31:59.482 --> 32:01.963
And I am leaving you...
for good.

32:02.007 --> 32:03.399
For the priest

32:03.443 --> 32:05.445
that you were supposedly
never gonna see again?

32:06.446 --> 32:08.143
You know about that?

32:08.187 --> 32:11.494
-Yeah.
-Well, Caleb is a good man.

32:11.538 --> 32:13.627
An honest man.

32:13.670 --> 32:14.933
And he makes me happy.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.586
So that's
why I came

32:16.630 --> 32:18.501
up here--
to say goodbye.

32:20.764 --> 32:22.766
If this was about my feelings,

32:22.810 --> 32:24.768
I would never stop
fighting for you.

32:24.812 --> 32:26.292
Ever.

32:26.335 --> 32:28.642
But this is about your feelings,

32:28.685 --> 32:31.601
so I'll honor your wishes,
and I will leave you alone.

32:33.777 --> 32:35.518
As much as I hate it.

32:35.562 --> 32:37.607
Thank you.

32:38.391 --> 32:40.567
That's the most selfless thing
I've seen you do.

32:51.099 --> 32:52.666
Do you not understand
how to negotiate?

32:52.709 --> 32:54.146
You can't just
keep going up.

32:54.189 --> 32:57.062
That's called
the Alexis way of negotiating.

32:57.105 --> 32:59.673
Seems like most things
only work the Alexis way.

32:59.716 --> 33:02.023
Negotiating, drinking, foreplay.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.025
Well, I never
heard you complain.

33:05.809 --> 33:07.028
How did we get here?

33:07.072 --> 33:09.204
I think
your daughter locked us in.

33:10.162 --> 33:12.164
I don't know, but...

33:12.207 --> 33:14.035
maybe we can work this out?

33:17.908 --> 33:19.040
I locked you in here

33:19.084 --> 33:20.389
with the wrong mother.

33:20.433 --> 33:21.869
Fallon...

33:21.912 --> 33:23.001
I want you to know...

33:23.044 --> 33:24.219
Hush, woman.

33:24.959 --> 33:28.354
I realized that if Dominique
hadn't betrayed you again,

33:28.397 --> 33:30.182
you wouldn't have been
so hell-bent on revenge.

33:30.225 --> 33:31.879
That does make
some sense, but...

33:31.922 --> 33:35.361
No "buts." Go deal
with your insane mom,

33:35.404 --> 33:38.407
agree to a settlement with mine,
and then get out of this house,

33:38.451 --> 33:40.061
because I know
you can't stand it here.

33:40.105 --> 33:42.237
This place does
make people do crazy things.

33:48.026 --> 33:52.291
So, how do we celebrate
our new, unbreakable alliance?

33:52.334 --> 33:55.468
By not pretending that
we have one, because we don't.

33:55.511 --> 33:58.732
Excuse me.
Where is this coming from?

33:58.775 --> 34:00.212
Take your pick.

34:00.255 --> 34:03.519
Ruining my wedding,
ruining Blake's life,

34:03.563 --> 34:06.261
destroying the manor
and the Carrington dynasty.

34:06.305 --> 34:08.611
I mean, you got your wish,

34:08.655 --> 34:10.657
Mother.

34:10.700 --> 34:12.093
You've driven everyone away.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.139
I think what you need is
some time alone

34:14.182 --> 34:15.444
without all the chaos.

34:15.488 --> 34:18.404
I agree, which is exactly why

34:18.447 --> 34:20.449
I am moving out of the manor.

34:21.146 --> 34:22.408
First thing tomorrow.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.323
But I did all of this for you.

34:24.366 --> 34:27.369
No. No, you didn't.
You did this for you.

34:28.370 --> 34:30.807
So, hopefully,
everything works out.

34:30.851 --> 34:33.071
But if it doesn't...

34:34.550 --> 34:36.596
...don't call me.

34:44.169 --> 34:47.085
Sam, I'm surprised
to hear from you,

34:47.128 --> 34:49.609
especially without your backup singers.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.915
I deserve that.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.918
Look, I don't like

34:54.962 --> 34:57.791
that we haven't spoken
since our Brian Littrell call.

34:57.834 --> 34:59.619
Yeah. Me, neither.

34:59.662 --> 35:01.838
And I'm sorry about that.

35:01.882 --> 35:05.712
So... goodbye.

35:05.755 --> 35:07.975
Sam?

35:08.758 --> 35:10.673
Are you... are you there?

35:10.717 --> 35:12.588
Sam?

35:12.632 --> 35:14.938
Pick up the phone!

35:19.421 --> 35:20.553
Hello?

35:20.596 --> 35:23.382
Look, I know
I went a little crazy

35:23.425 --> 35:26.776
with the gifts
and... the Backstreet Boy.

35:28.213 --> 35:30.345
I think
I was just afraid that...

35:30.389 --> 35:32.652
just me on a screen
wouldn't be enough

35:32.695 --> 35:34.132
to keep you interested.

35:35.524 --> 35:38.397
But I think
that what you're looking for,

35:38.440 --> 35:40.790
or what I hope
you're looking for, is just me.

35:40.834 --> 35:43.184
Of course that's what I want.

35:43.228 --> 35:47.754
Sam, that's all I wanted,
just to... talk.

35:47.797 --> 35:49.756
Well, here I am.

35:49.799 --> 35:54.195
So let's just shut off
our screens and do that.

35:55.022 --> 35:56.676
Okay.

36:03.813 --> 36:05.685
We need to talk.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.948
Is it about
the Colbys in Ice design?

36:07.991 --> 36:09.602
I guess
I could make you more prominent.

36:09.645 --> 36:12.648
As usual, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:12.692 --> 36:13.910
But Alexis and I

36:13.954 --> 36:15.912
have agreed
to a divorce settlement,

36:15.956 --> 36:17.436
and I'm moving back home.

36:17.479 --> 36:19.220
Thank God!

36:19.264 --> 36:21.831
Not that you're leaving,
just that you've made peace.

36:21.875 --> 36:25.270
It's always healthier to release
anger than to hold on to it.

36:25.313 --> 36:28.447
Then this is gonna
feel super healthy.

36:28.490 --> 36:30.840
Because I wasn't angry
at Alexis.

36:30.884 --> 36:32.494
I was mad at you...

36:32.538 --> 36:33.669
Hmm.

36:33.713 --> 36:35.280
...for choosing her
over your own son.

36:35.323 --> 36:38.239
I can see how
it would look that way,

36:38.283 --> 36:40.285
but sweetheart, I was cornered.

36:40.328 --> 36:42.025
No, it's a pattern with you.

36:43.026 --> 36:45.028
Your obsession with
the Carringtons has always come

36:45.072 --> 36:46.378
at the expense
of your own family.

36:46.421 --> 36:48.380
These mineral
rights have shown

36:48.423 --> 36:50.947
that you're more connected
to generations of their greed

36:50.991 --> 36:53.907
than to me, Monica
or even Vanessa.

36:53.950 --> 36:56.475
That's hilarious,
coming from you.

36:56.518 --> 36:58.085
What's that supposed to mean?

36:58.128 --> 37:01.262
You have spent years

37:01.306 --> 37:03.743
trying to destroy Blake.

37:03.786 --> 37:04.700
You fake

37:04.744 --> 37:06.441
married his daughter, and then,

37:06.485 --> 37:10.097
you actually married
his ex-wife.

37:10.140 --> 37:11.359
And you say

37:11.403 --> 37:13.448
<i>I'm</i> obsessed
with the Carringtons?

37:13.492 --> 37:16.190
They may be
a greedy family,

37:16.234 --> 37:19.193
but those diamonds... are mine.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.064
You're right.

37:21.108 --> 37:22.762
I was obsessed,

37:22.805 --> 37:24.416
but I'm done now.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.809
And I'm done fighting you
on this excavation.

37:26.853 --> 37:28.376
One of us has

37:28.420 --> 37:30.596
to be the adult here, and
it's clearly not gonna be you.

37:32.119 --> 37:35.383
So I'm giving Alexis the money
she needs, and I'm out of this.

37:36.819 --> 37:39.300
Good luck being
a wealthy Carrington.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.520
It's worked so well
for the rest of them.

37:51.878 --> 37:54.837
Well, you're finally
getting your wish.

37:54.881 --> 37:57.405
Mm, private
Jefferson Starship concert?

37:57.449 --> 38:00.278
No. We're moving out.

38:01.670 --> 38:04.586
And getting far away
from my mother.

38:04.630 --> 38:06.762
I... am going to tell
the 20 million people

38:06.806 --> 38:09.939
watching our interview, plus
a certain investment group,

38:09.983 --> 38:11.985
that the Fallon Unlimited
brand is thriving,

38:12.028 --> 38:13.160
and that I

38:13.203 --> 38:14.683
officially have nothing to do

38:14.727 --> 38:16.946
with the Carrington dynasty
madness

38:16.990 --> 38:18.861
anymore. Done.

38:18.905 --> 38:19.993
Okay.

38:20.036 --> 38:21.690
Well, your mouth
is saying "okay,"

38:21.734 --> 38:24.345
but your face
is saying "no-kay."

38:24.389 --> 38:26.260
I know you, Fallon.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.001
We can move
10,000 miles away,

38:28.044 --> 38:30.220
but you'll still be connected
to this family.

38:30.264 --> 38:31.134
Your mother
behaving

38:31.178 --> 38:32.788
like a child-- that's on her.

38:32.832 --> 38:34.442
But you being the mature one--

38:34.486 --> 38:36.488
that's on you.

38:36.531 --> 38:38.577
Moving away
won't solve anything.

38:43.799 --> 38:46.411
Why couldn't I have married
beautiful but dumb?

38:51.503 --> 38:54.332
Deputy Commissioner Dawkins,
thanks for joining me.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.986
Oh, how can I help
our esteemed Owner of the Year?

38:57.030 --> 38:59.249
I'm afraid it's
not good news.

38:59.293 --> 39:02.035
I have found evidence
of a gambling ring

39:02.078 --> 39:04.124
involving multiple
players in our league.

39:04.167 --> 39:05.778
That's unfortunate.

39:05.821 --> 39:07.823
Well, what's unfortunate is,
from what I can tell,

39:07.867 --> 39:10.043
you are the ringleader.

39:10.086 --> 39:11.827
So, here's
how I see it.

39:11.871 --> 39:13.699
You've got two options.

39:13.742 --> 39:15.265
We can go to the press together,

39:15.309 --> 39:16.919
and you can
come clean,

39:16.963 --> 39:18.443
or you can deny it,

39:18.486 --> 39:20.532
and I can go
to the press alone.

39:20.575 --> 39:22.621
You know,
there's a third option,

39:22.664 --> 39:25.580
where you just keep
your mouth shut about this.

39:25.624 --> 39:28.235
And why would I choose
that option?

39:28.278 --> 39:30.629
'Cause I heard that
you've been sniffing around,

39:30.672 --> 39:32.282
and if you say anything
about this,

39:32.326 --> 39:35.155
multiple players
will testify that

39:35.198 --> 39:37.113
you are the ringleader.

39:37.157 --> 39:38.419
Not a good look for our first

39:38.463 --> 39:40.029
African-American
Owner of the Year.

39:41.988 --> 39:45.557
Option number three sounds
pretty good now, doesn't it?

39:52.390 --> 39:55.131
Well, I see
it didn't take you long

39:55.175 --> 39:56.655
to mark your territory.

39:57.525 --> 39:59.527
Please tell me
I'm not standing in urine.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.355
Cute. And gross.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.052
Does this mean
you've come to your senses?

40:03.096 --> 40:04.358
Let me guess.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.968
You want me by your side
at the interview.

40:06.012 --> 40:07.579
I have come to my senses.

40:07.622 --> 40:09.624
So I am going
to give you a little preview

40:09.668 --> 40:11.409
of what I'll be
telling the world.

40:11.452 --> 40:14.194
That rumors of the
Carrington dynasty crumbling

40:14.237 --> 40:16.022
are wildly exaggerated.

40:16.065 --> 40:17.763
Are they?

40:17.806 --> 40:19.460
I think it already has crumbled.

40:19.504 --> 40:22.724
In fact, I will be taking over

40:22.768 --> 40:24.378
as head of the dynasty.

40:24.422 --> 40:27.686
And I will be doing so
right here, in Carrington Manor,

40:27.729 --> 40:30.428
in this office,
so get your ass up and out.

40:30.471 --> 40:34.301
Ooh. I love to see you
all revved up.

40:34.954 --> 40:36.303
And staying in my house.

40:36.346 --> 40:38.305
Oh, about that.

40:38.348 --> 40:39.393
About what?

40:39.437 --> 40:41.395
I am currently in the process

40:41.439 --> 40:43.658
of purchasing all
of the land holding access roads

40:43.702 --> 40:44.572
that surround the manor.

40:44.616 --> 40:46.487
So while you may
own the house,

40:46.531 --> 40:48.228
and Dominique owns
the mineral rights,

40:48.271 --> 40:49.882
I'll own the access to them.

40:49.925 --> 40:51.536
Meaning?

40:51.579 --> 40:55.235
Meaning, if you act
like a child again,

40:55.278 --> 40:57.280
the only diamonds
you'll ever see are

40:57.324 --> 40:58.891
when you're playing
Texas Hold'em.

40:58.934 --> 41:00.283
I...

41:00.327 --> 41:01.720
have been
the collateral damage

41:01.763 --> 41:04.113
from my family's poor choices
my entire life,

41:04.157 --> 41:06.638
but that ends now.

41:14.907 --> 41:17.257
Forgive me, Father.
I'm about to sin.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.085
Excuse me?

41:19.128 --> 41:20.173
Not gonna make a scene.

41:20.216 --> 41:21.566
That would be sacrilegious.

41:23.611 --> 41:25.395
What are you doing here, Blake?

41:25.439 --> 41:28.442
Let me make
my confession clear.

41:28.486 --> 41:32.098
I have a very dangerous Albanian
friend who owes me a favor,

41:32.141 --> 41:33.752
and that favor
will be to make

41:33.795 --> 41:35.754
your life hell on earth

41:35.797 --> 41:38.452
if you don't disappear
from Cristal's life.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.107
You think I'm afraid of you?

41:41.150 --> 41:43.675
I really don't care.
But if you want to be stubborn

41:43.718 --> 41:45.372
and don't go away,

41:45.415 --> 41:47.374
when I come back,

41:47.417 --> 41:49.376
you can bet it's not gonna be
for forgiveness.
