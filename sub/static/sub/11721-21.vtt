06:29.170 --> 06:30.599
I was brought back here

06:40.013 --> 06:41.914
partied too hard
and paid the price for it.

06:41.916 --> 06:43.050
Looks like classic

06:43.052 --> 06:44.544
rock and roll death to me.

06:44.546 --> 06:47.382
Except the pills are a commonly
prescribed allergy medication,

06:47.384 --> 06:50.117

to warrant such an adverse reaction.

Upper airway irritation,

flushed skin, purplish-

are we thinking?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.007
One of these guys
slips him the bottle,

10:40.009 --> 10:41.973
figures he'd thin out
the competition?

10:41.975 --> 10:43.372
JERRY:
Makes sense.

10:43.374 --> 10:45.509
Collins was a big up-and-comer
on the scene.

10:45.511 --> 10:46.918
He's also a local boy,

10:46.920 --> 10:49.583
which made him the favorite
to take down the title tonight.

10:49.585 --> 10:51.622
Any prize money come with that?

10:51.624 --> 10:52.918
$20K in cash.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.455
But I got to tell
you guys,

10:54.457 --> 10:57.297
my conspiracy radar's picking up
some bad juju on this one.

10:57.299 --> 11:00.697
Seriously. Up until the point
when he collapsed and died,

11:00.699 --> 11:03.031
Collins' performance
was spot-on.

11:03.033 --> 11:04.735
At least that's what I thought.

11:04.737 --> 11:06.934
Later, when I went to the video,

11:06.936 --> 11:10.101
I realized he made
one ginormous mistake.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.637
Check out the jumpsuit.
It's a classic sunset design,

11:12.639 --> 11:15.675
only the color scheme
is more from Elvis's

11:15.677 --> 11:16.873
American Eagle suit.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.502
Blue and red
instead of yellow and copper.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.878
So what?

11:21.880 --> 11:23.740
So that's like Superman
flying around in a purple cape.

11:23.742 --> 11:25.380
It's unnatural.

11:25.382 --> 11:27.244
It's unholy, even.

11:27.246 --> 11:29.115
Elvis never wore
anything like this.

11:29.117 --> 11:31.113
Oh. All right,
I get it.

11:31.115 --> 11:33.077
So our victim
was not Elvis.

11:33.079 --> 11:35.580
JERRY: No, but he was
a professional ETA.

11:35.582 --> 11:38.147
And considering the points
awarded for wardrobe,

11:38.149 --> 11:41.586
it seems a little odd that he'd
make such an unforced error.

11:41.588 --> 11:44.154
DANNY: Yeah, totally.
Um, you know,

11:44.156 --> 11:46.818
to have a conspiracy theory, you
actually need a theory though.

11:46.820 --> 11:49.194
I admit,
it's a work in progress.

11:49.196 --> 11:50.658
Okay, uh, Jerry, thank you.

11:50.660 --> 11:52.129
We will, uh, explore

11:52.131 --> 11:54.560
the costume angle a little
later on, but I think right now

11:54.562 --> 11:55.896
we should focus on
our suspect pool.

11:55.898 --> 11:57.496
We find out who gave
the Vic that bottle,

11:57.498 --> 12:00.029
we find our killer-- so let's
all split up and find an Elvis.

12:00.031 --> 12:02.469
Yeah, should be interesting.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.100
MAN:
<i>Poison?</i>

12:04.102 --> 12:05.636
That ain't my style.

12:05.638 --> 12:08.635
I want to kill someone,
I use my bare hands!

12:08.637 --> 12:11.003
You know Elvis was

12:11.005 --> 12:12.675
a black belt in karate, right?

12:12.677 --> 12:15.276
Yeah, I think...
I think I heard that.

12:15.278 --> 12:17.075
MAN:
<i>Why would I want Lane dead?</i>

12:17.077 --> 12:19.648
It's not like I got a shot at
winning this thing-- look at me.

12:19.650 --> 12:21.248
Young man's game, huh?

12:21.250 --> 12:22.583
I'm a 71-year-old Elvis

12:22.585 --> 12:24.248
with a double knee replacement.

12:24.250 --> 12:27.384
But I still got my share
of sideburn chasers.

12:27.386 --> 12:28.488
Sideburn chasers?

12:28.490 --> 12:30.791
Yeah, chicks, man.
My groupies.

12:31.657 --> 12:34.224
(women giggling, horn toots)

12:34.226 --> 12:36.561
My knees don't work
too well,

12:36.563 --> 12:40.034
but the rest of me
still does.

12:40.036 --> 12:43.034
WOMAN: <i> To be honest,</i>
<i>the whole competitive thing</i>

12:43.036 --> 12:44.739
doesn't really interest me.

12:44.741 --> 12:47.340
I'm all about
challenging perceptions.

12:47.342 --> 12:50.077
Like, why does Elvis...

12:50.079 --> 12:52.781
even have to be a man?

12:52.783 --> 12:54.149
I don't know.

12:54.151 --> 12:55.787
That's a... that's
a very good point,

12:55.789 --> 12:57.282
but you're not
answering my question.

12:57.284 --> 12:59.656
Were you or were you not in
Lane Collins' dressing room

12:59.658 --> 13:01.686
prior to his performance?

13:01.688 --> 13:04.759
No. I wasn't
in his dressing room.

13:04.761 --> 13:07.193
(quietly):
But I can find out who was.

13:07.195 --> 13:08.562
Oh, yeah?

13:08.564 --> 13:10.866
Just give me one of them badges,
and I can crack the case.

13:10.868 --> 13:14.202
Nixon deputized Elvis,
you know.

13:14.204 --> 13:17.138
Made him a federal
narcotics... agent.

13:17.140 --> 13:19.539
You don't say.

13:19.541 --> 13:21.811
Sure, I was in Lane's dressing
room-- I stopped by to wish him

13:21.813 --> 13:23.844
good luck and offer him a peanut
butter and banana sandwich.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.820
I always pack
a few extra,

13:25.822 --> 13:27.620
'cause I'm hypoglycemic.

13:27.622 --> 13:30.189
Did you offer him a drink
with that, maybe some bourbon?

13:30.191 --> 13:32.126
(laughs):
No. That's funny.

13:33.192 --> 13:36.125
Lane had actually
gotten one as a gift.

13:36.127 --> 13:38.932
He was cracking it open
when I came in.

13:38.934 --> 13:42.531
He did offer me a shot,
but I said no-- 16 months sober.

13:42.533 --> 13:45.466
You have no idea how lucky you
are; that bottle was poisoned.

13:45.468 --> 13:48.634
If that had been vodka,
I'd be dead right now.

13:48.636 --> 13:50.970
Lane never really talked
about his personal life.

13:50.972 --> 13:52.378
In this business,

13:52.380 --> 13:54.610
you kind of learn to check
your identity at the front door.

13:54.612 --> 13:56.745
But the rumors
started to flow,

13:56.747 --> 13:59.081
and eventually, we all learned
about his background.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.217
What background is that?

14:01.219 --> 14:04.217
LANE: ♪ She's everything
that you wanted ♪

14:04.219 --> 14:07.858
♪ You can't pretend anymore
'cause you found it... ♪

14:07.860 --> 14:09.426
CHIN:
<i>So, Lane Collins</i>

14:09.428 --> 14:11.964
was the lead singer in a
band called Freelance Riot.

14:11.966 --> 14:13.163
This song

14:13.165 --> 14:16.235
was all over the radio
for a few months back in 2006.

14:16.237 --> 14:18.371
These guys were hyped
as the biggest musical act

14:18.373 --> 14:19.771
to come out of Hawaii
since Jack Johnson.

14:19.773 --> 14:21.172
Uh-huh. I guess
it didn't work out.

14:21.174 --> 14:22.773
I never heard of them.
Well, they released

14:22.775 --> 14:24.374
a couple of albums
that went nowhere.

14:24.376 --> 14:26.510
Finally called it quits
a few months ago.

14:26.512 --> 14:27.951
Only thing, they're breakup
wasn't quite mutual.

14:27.953 --> 14:30.086
When the news broke,
the guitar player,

14:30.088 --> 14:31.413
Kaleo Fisher,
firebombed the Internet.

14:31.415 --> 14:33.820
Check out some
of these messages.

14:33.822 --> 14:35.885
GROVER:
At Lane Collins.

14:35.887 --> 14:38.756
"Still dislodging
the knife from my back.

14:38.758 --> 14:40.627
Thanks for throwing it
all the way, dude."

14:40.629 --> 14:43.260
Hashtag "choke
on puke and die."

14:43.262 --> 14:45.699
Yeah, and according
to Chubby Elvis,

14:45.701 --> 14:48.468
Lane told him that the bottle
was a gift from an old friend.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.605
Where do we find this guy?

14:50.607 --> 14:52.868

15:13.659 --> 15:15.720
Far cry from selling

15:15.722 --> 15:19.022
Playing this crowd every night
would make a guy homicidal.

15:19.024 --> 15:21.028
(phone ringing)

15:21.030 --> 15:22.628
Danny, what's up?

15:22.630 --> 15:25.291
It, uh, pains me to say it,
but Jerry might have been

15:25.293 --> 15:26.964
onto something
with his whole jumpsuit theory.

15:26.966 --> 15:28.796
How's that?
We dumped our victim's phone.

15:28.798 --> 15:31.008
Turns out
he made six phone calls

15:31.010 --> 15:33.013
to a local costume shop.
What's up, guys?

15:33.015 --> 15:35.213
Uh, anyway, he obviously knew
there was something wrong,

15:35.215 --> 15:37.420
and he was trying
to figure out why he got

15:37.422 --> 15:38.652
the wrong jumpsuit,
I'm guessing.

15:38.654 --> 15:39.820
Well, you see, buddy?

15:39.822 --> 15:41.419
There is a method
to Jerry's madness.

15:41.421 --> 15:43.690
Well, whoever's at that shop
might have been the last person

15:43.692 --> 15:45.692
our victim spoke to, so I'm
gonna head over there now.

15:45.694 --> 15:46.660
All right, keep me posted.

15:46.662 --> 15:48.797

Mahalo.

15:59.673 --> 16:01.766
Kaleo Fisher.

16:03.103 --> 16:04.100
Why don't you take five.

16:04.102 --> 16:05.467
KALEO:
<i>So crazy.</i>

16:05.469 --> 16:08.003
I can't believe Lane's gone.
Really?

16:08.005 --> 16:10.440
'Cause I believe your
exact words to him were:

16:10.442 --> 16:11.935
"Choke on puke and die."

16:11.937 --> 16:13.774
Come on, I was
just venting.

16:13.776 --> 16:16.846
Turns out, social media
isn't the best place

16:16.848 --> 16:19.446
to express yourself when
you're drunk and bitter.

16:19.448 --> 16:20.982
Yeah. So now
you're gonna tell us

16:20.984 --> 16:22.645
how much you loved
the guy, right?

16:22.647 --> 16:25.252
No. I hated him.

16:25.254 --> 16:27.483
I poured my life
into that band,

16:27.485 --> 16:29.483
and he took it all away.

16:29.485 --> 16:31.522
I mean, look around.

16:31.524 --> 16:34.953
I'm singing cover
songs to tourists.

16:34.955 --> 16:36.289
This gig sucks.

16:36.291 --> 16:38.487
But as much as I blame Lane,

16:38.489 --> 16:41.062
he was also
my only ticket out of here.

16:41.064 --> 16:43.860
I'd been talking to some
booking agents about getting

16:43.862 --> 16:45.963
Freelance
back on the road, but...

16:45.965 --> 16:48.499
everyone knows--
without a front man,

16:48.501 --> 16:50.330
there's no band.

16:50.332 --> 16:52.202
STEVE:
So was Lane on board

16:52.204 --> 16:53.402
for this big reunion tour?

16:53.404 --> 16:55.433
I went to see him
a couple days ago

16:55.435 --> 16:57.968
to sell him on
the idea, and...

16:57.970 --> 17:00.534
he told me he loved me
like a brother,

17:00.536 --> 17:03.437
that he'd always be proud
of what we accomplished,

17:03.439 --> 17:07.705
but as far as he was concerned,
those days were behind him.

17:07.708 --> 17:09.442
GROVER:
So he shoots you down,

17:09.444 --> 17:11.743
and then a scant 48 hours later,

17:11.746 --> 17:14.078
he just drinks some poison
and drops dead.

17:14.079 --> 17:15.077
STEVE:
You know what's funny,

17:15.079 --> 17:16.339
the bottle of Hartigan
that killed him,

17:16.342 --> 17:17.507
according to witnesses,

17:17.509 --> 17:20.546
Lane said it was given to him
by an old friend.

17:20.548 --> 17:22.377
Wait.

17:22.380 --> 17:25.310
Hartigan?
That's what he was drinking?

17:25.313 --> 17:27.077
That's right.

17:27.079 --> 17:30.283
I didn't give him
that bottle...

17:30.285 --> 17:33.314
but I know who did.

17:33.316 --> 17:34.882
LANE (over speakers):

17:34.884 --> 17:38.426

17:38.428 --> 17:41.192

what I'm doing here?

17:42.788 --> 17:45.589
STEVE: Shh. It's coming up.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.661

17:53.663 --> 17:55.229
Mm.
You hear that?

17:55.231 --> 17:56.996
It's kind of hard to make out
what he's saying though.

17:56.998 --> 17:58.060
GROVER:
Well, it'd be helpful if

17:58.062 --> 18:00.027
we could talk to the
original lead singer, but,

18:00.029 --> 18:01.627
well... he's dead.
Right.

18:01.629 --> 18:04.371
But Miss Miller here,
she's a huge fan.

18:04.373 --> 18:06.297
I mean, you must've heard
this song a thousand times.

18:06.299 --> 18:07.505
Can you help us out?

18:07.507 --> 18:11.270
The lyric is: ♪ Playing

18:11.272 --> 18:13.373

18:13.375 --> 18:15.205
It sounds like that,
doesn't it?

18:15.207 --> 18:18.109
But it's not it. According
to the guy who cowrote the song,

18:18.111 --> 18:19.709
it's actually:
"Breaking hearts again."

18:19.711 --> 18:22.474
(laughs):
Breaking hearts again?

18:22.476 --> 18:24.042
Uh... no.

18:24.044 --> 18:25.545

18:47.134 --> 18:50.331
Kaleo said the band
used to have a good laugh

18:50.333 --> 18:53.066
when you'd show up to gigs
with a bottle of Hartigan.

18:53.068 --> 18:55.098
Lane didn't have
the heart to tell you

18:55.100 --> 18:56.633
that you got
the words wrong.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.369
And nobody's ever
heard of a rock star

18:58.371 --> 19:00.072
turning down a free
bottle of hooch.

19:00.074 --> 19:02.869
STEVE: I'm pretty sure that Lane
knew you were obsessed with him.

19:02.871 --> 19:04.708
It's just too bad
that he didn't know

19:04.710 --> 19:06.004
how certifiably crazy you are.

19:06.006 --> 19:10.309
HPD found
wax on your stovetop

19:10.311 --> 19:11.814
in your apartment.

19:11.816 --> 19:13.318
Same type of wax

19:13.320 --> 19:15.350
that's used to
seal the tops

19:15.352 --> 19:17.055
of old Hartigan
bourbon bottles.

19:17.057 --> 19:19.087
And you forgot
to clear your history

19:19.089 --> 19:20.727
on your Web browser.

19:20.729 --> 19:23.230
"How to kill someone
with poison."

19:23.232 --> 19:25.157
"Where to buy cyanide."

19:26.926 --> 19:30.223
He's the one
that should be embarrassed.

19:32.123 --> 19:34.855
(laughs):
I mean, come on.

19:34.857 --> 19:37.223
Dressing up like that,

19:37.225 --> 19:40.062
shaking his hips.

19:44.059 --> 19:46.559
That's why you killed him?

19:46.561 --> 19:48.894
'Cause he disappointed you?

19:52.400 --> 19:55.305
Nope.

19:55.307 --> 20:00.180
No, I killed him to protect him
from himself.

20:02.246 --> 20:04.685
To protect his legacy.

20:04.687 --> 20:08.188
Because now
people will remember him

20:08.190 --> 20:10.220
for what he really was.

20:10.222 --> 20:12.523
What is that?

20:12.525 --> 20:16.227
A legend,
like Morrison, like Cobain...

20:16.229 --> 20:18.594
Okay, let's not get
carried away, all right?

20:19.836 --> 20:21.561
(door buzzes)

20:21.563 --> 20:23.663
Whew, you're crazy.

20:25.568 --> 20:27.837
He's a legend.

20:32.172 --> 20:36.104
So, I mean, how's the irony
completely lost on this woman?

20:36.106 --> 20:38.272
The inspiration for
killing her idol

20:38.274 --> 20:40.912
is the song she got
the words wrong to.

20:40.914 --> 20:43.809
Well, what'd you expect?
The girl's 118 pounds of crazy.

20:43.811 --> 20:46.944
(phone ringing) But now that
she's confessed, I can finally get

20:46.946 --> 20:49.951
those pizzas home-- time
to get my deep dish on, baby.

20:49.953 --> 20:51.319
Yeah, Danny, what's up?

20:51.321 --> 20:52.950
DANNY:
I'm over at the costume shop.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.286
Oh, no, you can
stand down.

20:54.288 --> 20:56.357
We just got a confession.
Case is closed.

20:56.359 --> 20:58.190
No, no, we, uh,
we caught another case.

20:58.192 --> 21:00.095
Uh, shop owner's been shot dead.

21:00.097 --> 21:01.231
Uh, place has been tossed.

21:01.233 --> 21:02.696
Somebody's looking
for something,

21:02.698 --> 21:04.733
and I'm not sure that they found
what they were looking for.

21:04.734 --> 21:05.581
Wait a minute. What?

21:05.605 --> 21:07.673
DANNY: It's got to be
about Lane's costume.

21:14.545 --> 21:16.974
This is Dr. Max Bergman,
performing the autopsy

21:16.976 --> 21:18.573
on Lane Collins.

21:18.575 --> 21:21.180
The victim's 39
and appears to be dressed in...

21:21.182 --> 21:23.548
(two gunshots in distance)

21:34.294 --> 21:35.829
WOMAN:
911. What's your emergency?

21:35.831 --> 21:37.294
Down on the ground!

21:37.296 --> 21:39.135
Do it now!

21:39.137 --> 21:41.672
He so much as
blinks, shoot him.

22:08.041 --> 22:10.774
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

22:10.776 --> 22:12.677
(siren whoops)

22:12.679 --> 22:14.079
(tires screech)

22:20.717 --> 22:23.649
There were three of them,
all of them in masks.

22:23.651 --> 22:25.921
I keep thinking maybe there was
something I could have done.

22:25.923 --> 22:28.185
All right, Max, you can't
blame yourself for this.

22:28.187 --> 22:30.488
It's unsettling when
a cadaver goes missing.

22:30.490 --> 22:32.991
(phone ringing) I don't think the body's
what they were interested in.

22:32.993 --> 22:34.191
McGarrett.

22:34.193 --> 22:35.990
Yeah.

22:35.992 --> 22:37.965
We'll be right there.

22:38.935 --> 22:41.364
Three blocks from
the M.E.'s office.

22:41.366 --> 22:44.635
Didn't take them long
to strip that jumpsuit.

22:44.637 --> 22:45.897
GROVER:
Wow.

22:45.899 --> 22:49.196
Yeah, listen, uh...
explain this to me, would you?

22:49.198 --> 22:50.667
You're a smart a guy.

22:50.669 --> 22:53.866
I get the costume
switcheroo and all that--

22:53.868 --> 22:56.772
I've had the same thing happen
to me at the dry cleaners--

22:56.774 --> 22:59.709
but normally, when I get
somebody else's pants,

22:59.711 --> 23:00.981
they don't go

23:00.983 --> 23:02.980
on a violent killing spree
to get them back.

23:08.085 --> 23:09.484
Check this out.

23:09.486 --> 23:11.453
Why, they
must have...

23:11.455 --> 23:13.326
fallen off the jumpsuit.
(camera clicks)

23:13.328 --> 23:16.890
Except this one...
is a real diamond.

23:16.892 --> 23:19.394
Now, how could you
possibly know that?

23:19.396 --> 23:20.795
Because generally,

23:20.797 --> 23:24.099
fake diamonds
don't have serial numbers.

23:25.974 --> 23:28.469
KONO:
<i>You guys are gonna love this.</i>

23:28.471 --> 23:30.342
Remember this mug?

23:30.344 --> 23:31.974
STEVE:
Radomir Ivanovich.

23:31.976 --> 23:34.309
Knocked over a jewelry store
for a bunch of diamonds.

23:34.311 --> 23:36.011
Exactly. And according
to the serial number

23:36.013 --> 23:38.514
you found on that diamond,
it was from that heist.

23:38.516 --> 23:41.048
It turns out
that before he was killed,

23:41.050 --> 23:42.679
he actually stashed
that loot somewhere,

23:42.681 --> 23:45.076
and HPD's been trying
to recover it ever since.

23:45.078 --> 23:46.881
And damn if it didn't
just turn up

23:46.883 --> 23:49.343
in the most unexpected place.

23:50.649 --> 23:52.446
Well...

23:52.448 --> 23:55.517
we got us some pretty creative
diamond smugglers.

23:55.519 --> 23:57.380
All right, the convention
ends tomorrow, right?

23:57.382 --> 23:59.356
Which means all
these Elvises...

23:59.358 --> 24:01.986
Elvii.
Excuse me?

24:01.988 --> 24:03.689
The plural of Elvis is "Elvii."

24:03.691 --> 24:05.488
Jerry told me that-- you
weren't there-- and, uh,

24:05.490 --> 24:06.887
he's an authority
on the subject, so I just

24:06.889 --> 24:08.622
wanted you to know.
Okay, as I was saying,

24:08.624 --> 24:10.989
this convention's
gonna end tomorrow,

24:10.991 --> 24:13.460
and all these Elvii are gonna be
flying out together, right?

24:13.462 --> 24:15.363
Right. So the smugglers hide
these diamonds

24:15.365 --> 24:16.627
in an Elvis costume,

24:16.629 --> 24:20.131
and all TSA sees
is a glitzy jumpsuit going by.

24:20.133 --> 24:22.035
But this isn't your average
bedazzle job, right?

24:22.037 --> 24:24.404
So you got to get
a professional costumer.

24:24.406 --> 24:26.268
But the professional costumer
screws up

24:26.270 --> 24:28.572
and accidentally gives
the costume to Lane Collins.

24:28.574 --> 24:30.044
KONO:
On the exact day

24:30.046 --> 24:32.180
that a deranged fan
decides to kill him.

24:32.182 --> 24:33.715
Guy's got good luck.

24:33.717 --> 24:36.148
All right, so this
convention ends tomorrow.

24:36.150 --> 24:37.851
They'll be wrapping it up
tonight, which means

24:37.853 --> 24:39.514
we got less than
six hours. Chin, Kono,

24:39.516 --> 24:42.450
see if they ever had any leads
to the diamonds' whereabouts.

24:42.452 --> 24:43.858
If we could find
where Ivanovich

24:43.860 --> 24:45.322
stashed those diamonds,

24:45.324 --> 24:47.027
maybe it'll help us
lead to the smugglers.

24:47.029 --> 24:48.060
Copy.

24:48.062 --> 24:49.564
You know, I would think

24:49.566 --> 24:51.300
this guy's already got
a buyer lined up.

24:51.302 --> 24:52.530
I'm gonna check with Interpol,

24:52.532 --> 24:54.833
see if we can find who might be
on the receiving end.

24:54.835 --> 24:56.297
All right, good. You and me,

24:56.299 --> 24:58.103
we got someone to see.
Who's that?

24:58.105 --> 25:01.562
Who's the one person connected
to that heist who's still alive?

25:03.129 --> 25:06.162
♪ Aloha... ♪

25:06.164 --> 25:07.498
Oy.

25:07.500 --> 25:08.960
Barry Burns!

25:08.962 --> 25:10.360
Hey, fellas!

25:10.362 --> 25:13.399
Long time no see.

25:17.766 --> 25:21.235
I see, uh, house arrest
is treating you well, huh?

25:21.237 --> 25:23.074
It's the best ever.

25:23.076 --> 25:24.706
I get to exercise every day,

25:24.708 --> 25:26.641
and I'm catching up
on my reading,

25:26.643 --> 25:29.104
and taking a class online
in acrylic painting.

25:29.106 --> 25:30.877
Your wife
must be glad

25:30.879 --> 25:32.308
you're home.

25:32.310 --> 25:34.611
Mm... actually, she left me.

25:34.613 --> 25:36.475
I'm sorry to hear that.

25:36.477 --> 25:37.916
Oh, don't be.

25:37.918 --> 25:39.316
That's the best part about it.

25:39.318 --> 25:41.012
Now I'm ordering in.

25:41.014 --> 25:43.788
More than just food,
if you catch my drift.

25:43.790 --> 25:45.421
Oh.

25:45.423 --> 25:46.757
Yeah, I got it.

25:46.759 --> 25:48.892
Can I interest you guys
in a smoothie?

25:48.894 --> 25:50.797
I just started a new cleanse.

25:50.799 --> 25:51.965
I'm good.

25:51.967 --> 25:55.300
DANNY:
Uh, no, thanks.

25:55.302 --> 25:57.436
I don't drink anything I have to chew.
Oh.

25:57.438 --> 25:59.234
Barry, uh...

25:59.236 --> 26:01.369
it's been great catching up,
it really has.

26:01.371 --> 26:04.135
You look terrific. Uh, but we're
actually here on some business.

26:04.137 --> 26:07.007
Okay. What can I do for you?
Well, we were hoping

26:07.009 --> 26:08.975
you could tell us
where Radomir Ivanovich

26:08.977 --> 26:11.175
may have stashed
the diamonds he stole.

26:12.009 --> 26:13.543
(chuckles)

26:13.545 --> 26:15.847
Well... you're
not the first guys

26:15.849 --> 26:17.711
to come around
asking that question.

26:17.713 --> 26:18.919
Is that right?

26:18.921 --> 26:21.255
When the word spread
the diamonds were out there,

26:21.257 --> 26:24.054
every scumbag crook on
the Island wanted to get them.

26:24.056 --> 26:26.054
It became, like,
a bad-guy treasure hunt.

26:26.056 --> 26:28.293
And I'm always the first stop.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.156
Aha. You see, that's
probably because

26:30.158 --> 26:32.061
you are
Ivanovich's fence.

26:32.063 --> 26:34.493
Yes. But I'm also
a scumbag crook.

26:34.495 --> 26:37.533
You think he's gonna trust <i> me</i>
with something like that?

26:37.535 --> 26:39.165
That's a good point.

26:39.167 --> 26:40.469
Barry, we're gonna need a list

26:40.471 --> 26:42.973
of all the people
who came knocking, okay?

26:43.839 --> 26:46.045
Well...

26:46.047 --> 26:48.476
okay, I guess
I owe you guys one.

26:48.478 --> 26:51.475
You know, if it wasn't
for that deal you gave me,

26:51.477 --> 26:53.747
I'd probably be someone's
prison bitch right now.

26:53.749 --> 26:56.115
With a body like
that, definitely.

26:56.853 --> 26:57.883
Thank you.

26:57.885 --> 27:00.251
I guess.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.865
So check this out--
a couple months before he dies,

27:10.867 --> 27:14.031
Ivanovich charges $2,500
at a local wine shop.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.664
So the guy likes his wine.

27:15.666 --> 27:17.103
Actually, that's
the exact amount

27:17.105 --> 27:19.238
the shop charges
to rent a private locker

27:19.240 --> 27:20.534
in their wine cellar.

27:20.536 --> 27:22.469
Ivanovich prepaid
for an entire year.

27:22.471 --> 27:24.372
What's this?

27:24.374 --> 27:26.276
It's a police report.
Last week,

27:26.278 --> 27:28.708
three guys hit the shop
in the middle of the night.

27:28.710 --> 27:30.275
They busted open
a bunch of lockers,

27:30.277 --> 27:31.779
except they didn't take
a single bottle.

27:31.781 --> 27:33.778
'Cause they weren't
looking for wine,

27:33.780 --> 27:35.881
they were after
Ivanovich's diamonds.

27:37.146 --> 27:39.247
KONO: So the height
and build markers

27:39.249 --> 27:42.152
confirm that it was the same
crew that hit the M.E.'s office.

27:42.154 --> 27:44.722
And thanks to those masks, we're
no closer to identifying them.

27:44.724 --> 27:47.059
KONO: It seems like they're
not the only ones who knew

27:47.061 --> 27:48.563
where the diamonds
were stashed though.

27:48.565 --> 27:50.300
The shop owner said that
there was somebody else

27:50.302 --> 27:52.742
poking around the locker this
morning, so we pulled the video.

27:53.567 --> 27:56.068
Wait a minute,
this guy's got keys.

27:56.070 --> 27:57.867
How does he have keys
to Ivanovich's locker?

27:57.869 --> 27:59.939
Here's how.

27:59.941 --> 28:03.676
Facial rec I.D.'d him
as Adrian Ivanovich,

28:03.678 --> 28:05.316
Radomir Ivanovich's
brother.

28:05.318 --> 28:08.349
According to DHS, he entered
Hawaii less than 24 hours ago

28:08.351 --> 28:09.485
using an alias.

28:09.487 --> 28:11.252
And according to his file,
he makes his brother

28:11.254 --> 28:13.083
look like a Boy Scout
in comparison.

28:13.085 --> 28:14.619
Extortion, kidnapping,

28:14.621 --> 28:16.426
murder for hire--
Adrian's done it all.

28:16.428 --> 28:17.721
Guess he wasn't too happy

28:17.723 --> 28:19.456
that someone beat him
to the diamonds.

28:19.458 --> 28:21.656
The guy was accused of
war crimes in Bosnia.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.591
Who knows what
makes him happy?

28:23.593 --> 28:25.263
All right, so this guy's pissed,
looking for answers.

28:25.265 --> 28:26.327
What's his next move?

28:26.329 --> 28:28.295
If he knew where
the diamonds were stashed,

28:28.297 --> 28:30.969
he knew who his brother
was in business with.

28:30.971 --> 28:32.769
Oh, not Barry Burns.

28:32.771 --> 28:34.104
Barry.

28:37.305 --> 28:39.477
(phone ringing)

28:46.749 --> 28:48.945
(ringing continues)

28:51.147 --> 28:53.318
Don't answer that.

28:54.981 --> 28:56.483
Who the hell are you?

28:56.485 --> 28:59.747
You took something
from my brother.

28:59.749 --> 29:02.124
I'm here to
get it back.

29:13.817 --> 29:15.345
BARRY (recorded):
<i>This is Barry B.</i>

29:15.347 --> 29:17.752
Thanks for hollering at me.

29:17.754 --> 29:20.382
Leave a message,
and I'll holla back.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.211
I'd like to kill this guy--
even his voice mail's annoying.

29:22.212 --> 29:23.578
(phone ringing)
Yeah, keep trying.

29:23.580 --> 29:25.145
Lou, what do you got?

29:25.147 --> 29:26.448
So I been going
through this list

29:26.450 --> 29:28.575
