Taylor:
At 6:35 A.M. this morning,

00:04.605 --> 00:07.773
the l.A.P.D. Was notified
that 5-year-old Kayla weber,

00:07.775 --> 00:10.075
daughter of baseball pitcher
Jim weber

00:10.077 --> 00:13.946
was missing from her brentwood
home and may have been abducted.

00:13.948 --> 00:17.049
We have declared
a citywide tactical alert...

00:17.051 --> 00:21.653
Detailing over 150 officers
and detectives to find Kayla

00:21.655 --> 00:22.855
and bring her home.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.590
Who called in
the abduction?

00:24.592 --> 00:27.326
Kayla's mother, Lori weber.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.727
I was
in the kitchen,

00:28.729 --> 00:31.296
making Kayla's smoothie
like I do every morning.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.232
What time was this?
[ Sighs ]

00:33.234 --> 00:34.867
Oh, I don't know,
around 6:15?

00:34.869 --> 00:37.736
Kayla usually wakes
when she hears the blender,

00:37.738 --> 00:39.905
and she comes into the kitchen,
but she didn't come.

00:39.907 --> 00:42.574
And -- and when I went to see
if she was getting out of bed...

00:42.576 --> 00:44.343
Oh, my God.

00:44.345 --> 00:47.346
The house was locked!
Every door!

00:47.348 --> 00:49.782
Tao: Window screen
is in the bushes.

00:49.784 --> 00:52.284
Then there's the gouges
to the exterior window frame.

00:52.286 --> 00:55.187
Looks like someone pried the
window open from the outside.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.589
Whoever broke in here
knew which room was Kayla's.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.692
What about Jim weber?
Where was he during his
daughter's abduction?

01:00.694 --> 01:02.227
Jim wasn't home
last night.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.898
I dropped him off at, um, Santa
Monica airport around 8:30.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.967
He got on a helicopter
and took off.

01:08.969 --> 01:11.837
Provenza:
Where was he going?
I don't know.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.239
You don't know?
You're his bodyguard.

01:14.241 --> 01:17.676
I thought it's part of your job
to know where he is.

01:17.678 --> 01:20.779
If Jim doesn't tell me, I don't
ask. Also part of my job.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.649
Where were you when you
found out Kayla was missing?

01:23.651 --> 01:26.218
In the pool house,
where I stay.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.686
[ Dog barking ]

01:27.688 --> 01:29.955
Okay,

01:29.957 --> 01:32.624
Before turning in,
I checked the property,

01:32.626 --> 01:37.029
made sure the gates were locked
and the doors were secure.

01:37.031 --> 01:40.666
Uh, Curtis texted me that
he was back at the pool house

01:40.668 --> 01:42.601
if I needed anything,
and that was at 9:00.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.937
Did you speak to Curtis again
before this morning?

01:44.939 --> 01:46.038
Okay.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.907
So, he left.
And then what did you do?

01:48.909 --> 01:51.410
I was late
finishing up dinner.

01:51.412 --> 01:52.611
Pizza.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.113
Kayla --
she loves pizza.

01:54.115 --> 01:56.982
And then
I-I poured a glass of wine

01:56.984 --> 01:59.451
and fell asleep
with the TV on.

01:59.453 --> 02:02.554
And during the night,
you didn't hear anything?
Mnh-mnh.

02:02.556 --> 02:05.224
An odd noise,
a vehicle on the street?

02:05.226 --> 02:07.826
A house alarm?
No,
but see, the thing is...

02:07.828 --> 02:10.462
And this
is gonna sound bad, but...

02:10.464 --> 02:12.364
Jim didn't want me
setting the alarm.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.599
What?

02:13.601 --> 02:15.134
Why the hell not?

02:15.136 --> 02:16.702
Buzz: Their home
security provider has confirmed

02:16.704 --> 02:18.003
that for
the past two weeks,

02:18.005 --> 02:20.539
the webers have been
experiencing false alarms

02:20.541 --> 02:23.475
and outages on the
security cameras -- about
one every three days.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.245
Why didn't they
get it fixed?
It's not their house.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.746
They're just renting

02:27.748 --> 02:29.748
while Jim negotiates
with different baseball teams.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.017
Now, the landlord sent a bunch
of techs to check out the alarm,

02:32.019 --> 02:33.652
but nobody
can find anything wrong.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.155
So, this alarm
is being triggered on purpose

02:36.157 --> 02:38.557
just to make the webers
stop using it altogether?

02:38.559 --> 02:40.392
If that's the case,
it worked.

02:40.394 --> 02:43.362
Excuse me, sir, I don't know
if it means anything,

02:43.364 --> 02:44.997
but two different
k9 units

02:44.999 --> 02:46.965
converged on the driveway
up to the webers' house.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.835
But Kayla probably
went that way all the time.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.104
Okay, buzz,
we need security video

02:52.106 --> 02:55.174
from every house in this
fancy-schmancy neighborhood.

something that can help us.

will be arriving at p.A.B.
In 40 minutes.

Diminished capacity is usually
what the defense argues for

03:11.458 --> 03:12.991
in a case like this.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.494
Diminished capacity -- that was
thrown out before the trial.

03:15.496 --> 03:18.463
Oh, that's so the little creep
couldn't plead insanity.

03:18.465 --> 03:21.867
But in the penalty phase, all
that slider's lawyer needs to do

03:21.869 --> 03:24.903
is get one person on the jury
to decide that the dirtbag,

03:24.905 --> 03:27.573
you know, wasn't all there,
and he's set for life.

So your conclusion?

07:46.900 --> 07:49.067
Mr. rasenick has
a violent inferiority complex

07:49.069 --> 07:51.736
and instead of accepting
responsibility for his actions,

that the changes
he's made in his own life

Yes.

continues to avoid

09:45.652 --> 09:49.154

daughter went missing" part.

But if Jim thinks
we're trying to connect him

09:51.525 --> 09:54.426
to the disappearance
of his daughter, the next
time we talk to him,

09:54.428 --> 09:57.128
he'll be behind
a whole wall of attorneys.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.697
Here's something
that might help.

09:58.699 --> 10:02.100
I wouldn't release it
to the press, but it's progress.

10:02.102 --> 10:06.538
So, captain,
the house the webers rent

10:06.540 --> 10:09.841
is way off the main streets,
backing up to parkland.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.711
And between the
hours of midnight and
4:00 A.M. last night,

10:12.713 --> 10:15.680
collating all the security
footage from the neighborhood,

10:15.682 --> 10:18.750
we can find only one car
driving up and down the road

10:18.752 --> 10:20.819
leading to the residence.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.253
Where's the road run?

10:22.255 --> 10:25.256
From their driveway
to 1/4 of a mile due South

10:25.258 --> 10:27.826
on the other side
of the state park.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.761
The image
is very low-res.

10:29.763 --> 10:33.632
Any way to clean it up
so we can see more detail?

10:33.634 --> 10:34.666
Unfortunately, no.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.434
The house is too far back
from the street.

10:36.436 --> 10:39.204
But based on
the direction of the car,

10:39.206 --> 10:43.141
it leads us to this footage
about a minute and a half later.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.044
And -- and you're sure
it's the same car?

10:46.046 --> 10:47.646
From the abduction point
to here,

10:47.648 --> 10:49.948
there are no other streets
to turn off to.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.150
So it's definitely
the same car.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.718
It's a grayish-green
Chrysler 300

10:53.720 --> 10:56.254
with a matte-black finish
on the roof and the hood.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.189
You can tell all that
from this video?

10:58.191 --> 11:00.158
Even in this light,
we can tell the color of a car.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.395
And when it's passing
under lights, no hard
reflection from the top --

11:03.397 --> 11:04.996
okay, look, look, look --
if Mike says

11:04.998 --> 11:10.201
it's a grayish-green Chrysler
with black matte accents,

11:10.203 --> 11:12.937
then let's put out a broadcast
to that effect.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.372
We're in a hurry here.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.507
Hold on.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.709
I just got an update
from computer sciences.

11:17.711 --> 11:20.578
They've been monitoring the
webers' social-media accounts.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.881
This was just posted
on instagram,

11:22.883 --> 11:25.316

Jim weber.

11:26.653 --> 11:32.257
It's hers. It's Kayla's.
She loves that bunny blanket.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.292
But because
Kayla isn't in the picture,

11:34.294 --> 11:36.995
we have to question whether
it's her specific blanket

11:36.997 --> 11:38.496
or one bought
to look like it.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.932
That's Kayla's. She chewed on it
when she was teething.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.901
That's how the ear
got torn.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.402
She -- she sleeps
with it.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.938

12:19.306 --> 12:20.905

what they want.

12:20.907 --> 12:25.043

about where you were last night?

12:25.045 --> 12:27.212

12:27.214 --> 12:29.347

12:30.784 --> 12:32.317

12:32.319 --> 12:34.686

you were elsewhere,

12:34.688 --> 12:38.256
like Beverly hills, for example,
in a high-rise on Wilshire.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.758
And, you see,
that's odd,

12:39.760 --> 12:42.527
because we're looking for your
daughter and you lied to us.
