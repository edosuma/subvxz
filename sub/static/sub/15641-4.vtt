00:01.000 --> 00:03.220
<i>Previously, on Hit the Floor.</i>

00:03.378 --> 00:05.221
Pete Davenport.
Your father.

00:05.380 --> 00:07.803
- I think that went great, don't you?
- Minus Ahsha. What happened to her?

00:07.966 --> 00:09.513
Looks like she couldn't take
the pressure.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.519
- You lied to me.
- We can work through this together.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.305
You could have told me
that I had a child.

00:13.472 --> 00:14.894
And then what?
Chased you from city to city,

00:15.057 --> 00:16.684
bed to bed,
trying to make you be a father?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.272
- Sloane.
- Olivia.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.108
My gosh, I haven't seen you
in years.

00:20.270 --> 00:23.319
Mia, the point of you
getting gone was staying gone.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.234
Call me again
and I stop being so nice.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.277
I just got an email from Mia
with a telephone number.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.117
- Mia?
- Yeah, remember that dancer?

00:29.279 --> 00:31.702
The one who took off
right before the tryouts?

00:31.823 --> 00:33.166
She's reaching out.
- We need to find out

00:33.325 --> 00:35.043
-where she is.
- Already done.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.296
- Were any of the players there?
- They were around.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.707
Raquel and Ahsha?

00:39.873 --> 00:41.625
- No.
- Raquel's your friend.

00:41.792 --> 00:45.012
I'm learning to look out for myself.
You were my idol. You're not anymore.

00:45.170 --> 00:48.219
I'm moving out.

01:17.953 --> 01:20.422
It would be easier
if you'd just unpack.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.042
And probably quieter too.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.178
I'm competing
for worst houseguest ever.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.633
Did I Win?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.389
Well, I'd have something
to complain about

01:29.548 --> 01:32.222
if you didn't wear
those tiny shorts to bed.

01:32.342 --> 01:35.516
I should be waking you up with
breakfast in bed for taking me in.

01:35.679 --> 01:39.149
Ahsha, seriously? Babe, come on,
it's no worries, all right?

01:39.266 --> 01:40.768
You'd do the same for me.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.936
Yeah.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.735
Oh, really?

01:45.897 --> 01:48.901
Kidding. Still,
I'm asking some of the girls

01:49.026 --> 01:51.245
if anyone's looking
to take in a stray,

01:51.403 --> 01:53.371
so I don't have to cramp your style.

01:53.530 --> 01:57.660
Babe, I'm a gym teacher. Okay?
I tuck my polo in my khakis every day.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.708
My style has left the building.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.548
You're worried about today.

02:03.665 --> 02:07.795
Babe, come on, you're shooting
the calendar. You should be stoked.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.556
Lots of hot, sexy bikini nakedness?

02:11.715 --> 02:15.185
Exactly. Sexy's not my thing
on my best day.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.475
And with everything going on
with my mother, it's just not.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.938
Wait, wait. Back up.
Sexy's not your what?

02:21.099 --> 02:24.694
I'm not putting myself down.
I'm just saying I'm Jennifer Aniston.

02:24.853 --> 02:29.700
I'm not Angelina Jolie. I'm Care Bear.
I haven't shined yet at work.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.577
It's not even that I haven't shined.
I almost got booted.

02:32.736 --> 02:37.207
It's like today was designed
to get me kicked off once and for all.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.960
Babe.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.504
Listen to me.

02:43.622 --> 02:48.128
You are the sexiest woman
I've ever met.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.551
Oh, woman.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.968
Oh, come on now.
Give me a little booty tooch.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.223
God, I wish I could be there today.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.858
Wish me luck.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.563
You don't need luck.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.869
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Mia?

03:19.032 --> 03:22.036
<i>Mia's not here. She was
crashing here but she left.</i>

03:22.202 --> 03:24.204
Left. Left where?

03:24.371 --> 03:27.420
<i>I have no idea.
She took off in a hurry.</i>

03:29.584 --> 03:33.054
Did she leave
a phone number or something?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.385
Okay.

03:53.567 --> 03:57.697
<i>Hi, you've reached Sloane and Ahsha,
please leave a message.</i>

03:57.821 --> 04:02.418
Sloane. Hey, it's Olivia again.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.460
Look,L"

04:08.540 --> 04:13.421
I... I was really hoping
I could talk to you and...

04:13.545 --> 04:17.675
I don't know, I guess
I could just keep calling but...

04:18.884 --> 04:21.433
Can you please call me back?

04:23.180 --> 04:25.182
Thanks.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.867
Is Harrison here?

04:40.030 --> 04:42.704
I need to add to the catering order
for the shoot today.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.828
Harrison's not overseeing
the catering. I am.

04:45.994 --> 04:50.124
- You're coming to the calendar shoot?
- Yeah, why?

04:50.290 --> 04:54.170
I don't know, I just... I think
that'd be a little too much.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.306
I'm not as traumatised here
as you may think.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.597
I may not be a Devil Girl any more,
but this is a good job.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.185
In fact, I think I'll enjoy
sitting in the shade for a change

05:05.347 --> 05:07.520
while y'all are melting in the hot sun.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.572
- This is what we're wearing?
-It's a string bikini.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.115
All I see is string.

05:26.284 --> 05:29.458
- What is that?
-It's my portable tan machine.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.583
Not all of us are blessed
with the mocha.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.751
These calendar pictures
are gonna be around forever.

05:34.918 --> 05:38.297
I need to work these mofos. I'm gonna
make love to that camera so hard,

05:38.421 --> 05:40.264
it's gonna need a cigarette
and a pregnancy test after.

05:40.382 --> 05:44.888
Tell me about it. I'm gonna take
that camera for a ride of its life,

05:45.053 --> 05:48.853
that's it just hickeys everywhere.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.943
I just need to make it through today
without falling on my face.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.738
- Literally or figuratively?
- I'd settle for either.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.574
Don't you worry,
you can stand behind me.

06:10.328 --> 06:13.548
Film crew's prepping. Girls are fitted
and have been run through the steps.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.835
Good. Good. The behind-the-scenes
DVD of the dance number

06:16.001 --> 06:18.003
is where we make the real money,
so that routine needs to be on point,

06:18.169 --> 06:19.512
even if you have to rehearse it
all afternoon.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.548
You can do your photo shoot
for February after.

06:21.715 --> 06:25.470
About February, I have another idea.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.180
Let me guess, you want the year.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.267
Actually, I want Ahsha to do it.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.570
February's your month.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.357
It's the sexiest month.
The one every guy turns to first.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.025
And some women.

06:40.191 --> 06:43.616
But obviously, you see
something in Ahsha that I don't.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.121
She continues to screw up,

06:45.280 --> 06:48.705
yet you remain ceaselessly dedicated
to keeping her on the team.

06:48.867 --> 06:52.417
So I'm giving her this chance.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.207
Call it a show of faith.

06:56.917 --> 07:00.012
Unless you don't think
she can do it.

07:00.170 --> 07:03.765
Sure. Ahsha will be February.

07:04.925 --> 07:08.099
Listen, I have an errand
I need to run this morning

07:08.219 --> 07:10.563
so I'm gonna have to have you
oversee things on set while I'm gone.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.441
An errand? What could possibly
be more important

07:13.600 --> 07:16.649
than being there for one
of the biggest days of the year?

07:16.811 --> 07:18.563
Call it a show of faith,

07:18.730 --> 07:21.609
unless you don't think
you can do it.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.820
Take your time getting to set.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.041
All right, ladies.
The bus is downstairs.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.171
We've got 11 hours of daylight.
There is no room for mistakes today.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.127
Let's go.

07:37.374 --> 07:41.345
Good news. You're getting your
own month on the calendar this year.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.804
My Own?

07:42.963 --> 07:45.933
I'm a rookie. I'm only supposed
to be in the group shots.

07:46.091 --> 07:49.095
Change of plans. You're February.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.854
February is your month.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.934
I'm offering you
an olive branch, Ahsha.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.524
Are you gonna take it or not?

07:58.687 --> 08:00.155
I am.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.032
- Knock 'em dead.
- I will.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.922
I didn't know you were pregnant.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.091
So if I wasn't pregnant,
then it would've been okay

08:28.258 --> 08:30.181
to sleep with the man
I was in love with?

08:31.886 --> 08:35.059
Can we, can we just go somewhere
and talk?

08:35.181 --> 08:38.230
- I'm not having this conversation.
- I came to apologise.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.066
You came here
to clear your conscience.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.650
I feel...

08:42.813 --> 08:44.612
I feel horrible.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.573
You made your bed
the minute you jumped into Pete's.

08:47.736 --> 08:51.115
I never would have... I'm sorry, can we
please just talk about talk about this?

08:51.281 --> 08:55.081
Olivia, the person I need to have
a conversation with is my daughter.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.463
She has moved out of my house.
She hasn't returned a single call.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.253
I have no idea
what's going on in her life.

09:00.415 --> 09:03.635
She's the one
I want to talk to, not you.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.631
We used to be friends.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.678
We used to be best friends.

09:12.844 --> 09:16.394
And then you changed.
You became some other person.

09:17.932 --> 09:21.653
And if you're still
anything like that girl...

09:21.811 --> 09:24.405
God help the girls
you're in charge of today.

10:02.769 --> 10:06.114
Jelena, hey, it's me.
I'm gonna be longer than I thought.

10:12.987 --> 10:16.617
That's it. Keep moving. Keep moving.
You are the hottest thing.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.047
You're literally everywhere.

10:23.206 --> 10:26.961
Wow, not even a hello? Figured you'd
be a little bit nicer to your host.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.425
- What are you talking about?
- This is my home,

10:29.546 --> 10:31.548
which I've offered up
out of the goodness of my heart.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.216
You're lying.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.560
Derek, I didn't bring enough platters
from the Playground.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.891
- Do you have any more in your kitchen?
- How would I know? I never go in there.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.601
Ask Jeeves.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.441
Are you kidding me?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.602
Okay, it's not really his name,
but he lets me call him that.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.488
It costs a little bit extra,
but it's totally worth it.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.275
I should have known
it was your house.

10:50.441 --> 10:51.863
Everything's so over-the-top.

10:51.985 --> 10:56.741
You should see my place in Malibu.
That's over-the-top.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.869
Let me know if you need anything.
I'll be around.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.797
So the Playground
is catering this?

11:04.956 --> 11:07.675
Thank God.
I could use a friendly face.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.178
Okay. What's going on?

11:10.336 --> 11:13.089
- I got my own month.
- That's great!

11:13.256 --> 11:18.433
It's February.
She's setting me up to fail.

11:18.595 --> 11:23.101
You're learning. Ahsha, just
because someone sets you up to fail

11:23.224 --> 11:24.817
doesn't mean you have to.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.739
Okay, my love, let's bring it,
let's see it, come on.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.411
No, just get into it.
Just relax for me please.

11:51.377 --> 11:55.473
Sweetheart, you've got to come out
from behind the heart, yeah?

11:58.134 --> 12:00.262
Sorry, I've never really
done this before.

12:00.428 --> 12:04.274
Look, just pretend the camera's
your boyfriend. It loves you.

12:18.196 --> 12:22.121
Can I take a minute?
I could use a minute.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.253
We are on a break, people.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.628
This is a disaster,
you have to help me.

12:33.628 --> 12:37.974
- Help you what?
- Do that thing you do.

12:38.132 --> 12:41.432
You can't teach someone
to be triple jointed in a day.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.222
I just need you to teach me
how to be sexy.

12:45.556 --> 12:49.982
Well, what's in it for me?
And don't say a friendship bracelet.

12:50.103 --> 12:53.323
I could teach you
first through fifth position.

12:53.481 --> 12:56.030
Ballet's for virgins.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.071
Can you teach me how to do
one of those switch kicks?

12:59.237 --> 13:00.989
Done.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.157
Let's go.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.762
I know you have
something to say. Say it.

13:17.922 --> 13:21.768
I'm good. The last time
I said something, I lost my job.

13:26.097 --> 13:29.226
Actually, I need you
to do something for me.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.901
If we ever had half a friendship,
I need you to tell me the truth.

13:34.022 --> 13:37.868
Did you have anything to do
with me losing my spot on the team?

13:39.610 --> 13:42.489
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.836
Then I was right.
We have nothing to talk about.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.787
Sloane?

14:26.908 --> 14:29.036
What are you doing here?

14:29.202 --> 14:31.751
I was looking for Ahsha.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.216
Well, the girls,
they're not here today.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.049
They're off shooting
their calendar, I think.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.430
Oh, I see.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.469
I didn't know. Thanks.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.356
Sloane, we're gonna have to talk
about this at some point.

14:54.519 --> 14:57.693
- What is this?
- I want to talk about Ahsha.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.574
I'm all talked out.
I've already had Olivia coming by.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.406
What did she say?

15:02.568 --> 15:05.742
I realise this is new information
for the two of you,

15:05.863 --> 15:08.457
but I dealt with this 2O years ago.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.664
I didn't have that luxury.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.501
Pete, if you want to talk about
Ahsha, we can do that later.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.419
But if you want to dig up
the bones from that night,

15:15.540 --> 15:17.542
it's not gonna happen.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.383
So that's it?
You're just gonna walk away?

15:22.713 --> 15:24.932
You've avoided me
for <i>22</i> years, Sloane.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.093
You're not gonna avoid me forever.

15:32.932 --> 15:36.061
Phase one, face.
Lips apart, puckered, no teeth.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.446
Pretend like
you just ate something sweet

15:38.604 --> 15:41.448
and you don't care
if it's dripping down your face.

15:45.111 --> 15:48.911
You look like your dentures
are coming loose. More seductive.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.668
Okay, we're moving on
to phase two.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.712
You have to sell the fantasy.
When the guys came to the club,

15:57.874 --> 16:00.127
they didn't want to hear
that I had to pick up paper towels,

16:00.293 --> 16:02.512
that I'm allergic
to three different kinds of berries.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.889
They wanted to hear
and see all the things

16:05.047 --> 16:06.890
their wives stopped doing
years ago,

16:07.049 --> 16:09.973
if they even knew how
in the first place.

16:15.725 --> 16:18.444
What kind of berries?

16:18.603 --> 16:20.605
Phase three.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.738
We are wearing
these tiny bikinis for a reason.

16:25.776 --> 16:28.620
We're selling the possibility
that at any moment,

16:28.779 --> 16:30.577
with a slight breeze,

16:30.740 --> 16:36.418
someone might be able to see
just a hint of something naughty.

16:38.456 --> 16:42.461
We want that too, Ahsha.
Don't we?

16:43.544 --> 16:46.718
Don't we want that, Ahsha?

16:46.881 --> 16:48.804
I don't know if I'm freaked out
or turned on.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.310
Use that.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.485
This isn't working.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.317
You're telling me, girl.
I'm exhausted.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.447
I need a power bar
and a Red Bull.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.825
There is some trick in your bathroom
and I can't get her out.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.665
I need to get ready for my photo shoot
and that's the best vanity in the house.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.420
All the other dancers
are getting ready outside.

17:18.579 --> 17:23.631
I don't primp on lawns. Are you going
to get her out? Or should I?

17:23.792 --> 17:26.967
Because I can guarantee
you'll have a gentler touch.

17:27.128 --> 17:30.258
That's my sister. I'll go get her.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.806
Twins. How cliché.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.766
- Where did they even come from?
- I think they came with the house.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.152
Hey, what is that?

17:41.310 --> 17:43.688
The photographer tried
to stick this on me in my picture.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.983
Talk about cliché.
Burn it for me, would you?

17:47.149 --> 17:49.026
Why would you wear
a Santa hat for February?

17:49.193 --> 17:52.163
I'm not doing February this year.
I gave that to Ahsha.

17:52.321 --> 17:57.168
- Wow, what a beautiful gesture.
- Thanks.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.751
Oh, by the way,
she's bombing big time

18:00.913 --> 18:02.881
so you should get some popcorn
and get out there

18:03.040 --> 18:04.917
because it is entertaining as hell.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.008
Hey, Baby, have you seen
Gina or Karina?

18:08.170 --> 18:10.764
- More entertaining than triplets?
- You're a mess.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.302
Ho, ho, ho.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.696
- I thought I said you just--
- No, you're not talking right now.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.861
I'm talking, you're listening.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.247
All right, I get it. I screwed up.

18:34.405 --> 18:38.535
You were the one good thing in my life
and I wrecked the hell out of it.

18:38.659 --> 18:42.505
But do you have any idea
what my life has been like since then?

18:43.914 --> 18:49.387
Injuries. Parasites pretending to be
my friend just so they could rob me,

18:49.503 --> 18:52.177
some of them in my own family.
Lost sponsorship.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.092
A sham marriage to somebody

18:54.258 --> 18:57.979
who literally only has use for me
when I'm a star. More injuries.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.732
I mean, every part of me
that can be broken has been broken.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.235
You think, really, you're
the only one who has problems?

19:04.393 --> 19:07.522
You're the only one whose feelings
and emotions matter?

19:10.107 --> 19:11.575
You done?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.618
You want a drink?

19:26.374 --> 19:28.342
All right, ladies.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.926
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

19:32.088 --> 19:35.513
One, two, three, four,
five, six, pivot now.

19:35.675 --> 19:39.270
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, and eight.

19:39.428 --> 19:43.274
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

19:43.432 --> 19:48.063
Two, four...
Okay, ladies, one more time.

19:49.438 --> 19:55.241
From the top. Five, six, seven,
eight. One, two, three, four...

19:56.612 --> 19:58.080
How'd it go?

19:58.239 --> 20:03.086
In the crapper. I went back after
break and they pushed me to later.

20:03.244 --> 20:06.214
They don't want to deal with me.
I don't want to deal with me.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.922
After today, Olivia's not going
to want to deal with me. I'm screwed.

20:10.084 --> 20:12.883
Come on, being a sex bomb is
in your blood.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.388
I've seen pictures of your mom
back in the day.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.141
- That lady knew how to work it.
- Yeah.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.267
I don't suppose
you want a live-in nanny?

20:19.427 --> 20:21.225
I thought you lived with your mother.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.473
We had a falling out.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.438
I grabbed my stuff
and I haven't spoken to her since.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.398
When my son crosses his arms

20:28.561 --> 20:31.280
and won't talk to me for five minutes,
it breaks my heart.

20:32.773 --> 20:36.698
Great. Now I have to be sexy while
I'm stabbing my mom in the heart.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.284
No, no, I'm sorry.
That's not what I was trying to say.

20:39.447 --> 20:42.621
I'll figure it out.
I'm gonna go take a walk.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.416
I need to clear my head.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.740
Hello?

21:24.658 --> 21:26.410
Mia?

21:29.079 --> 21:31.047
Hello?

22:07.493 --> 22:09.996
The Chateau.

22:11.747 --> 22:14.341
Wilshire Paragon?

22:14.500 --> 22:17.049
The Evetine?

22:17.211 --> 22:18.633
Hotel keys.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.281
Really?

22:45.447 --> 22:47.541
Looks like you found my bedroom.

22:47.700 --> 22:51.330
Oh, I saw all the trophies
and wandered in.

22:51.495 --> 22:54.840
- I'm not... I wasn't gonna...
- Do you mind?

22:58.002 --> 23:01.176
So what do you think of the house
with all your wandering?

23:01.338 --> 23:05.809
It's nice, yeah. Expensive.
If you're into that sort of thing.

23:05.968 --> 23:07.766
What do you really think?

23:07.928 --> 23:11.523
It's a museum of insanity.
The Church of Derek Roman.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.935
The girls usually like this place.

23:15.019 --> 23:17.113
I've seen those girls.

23:22.443 --> 23:25.162
All this wall space
and it's just you.

23:25.321 --> 23:29.201
No pictures of family,
friends, girlfriend.

23:30.701 --> 23:32.829
I mean girlfriends.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.372
Not even Mama?

23:34.538 --> 23:38.338
I mean, all players love their Mamas.
Isn't that, like, you guys' thing?

23:39.335 --> 23:42.305
Yeah, Mary Roman
isn't the sentimental type.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.640
None of my family
and friends are.

23:44.798 --> 23:47.642
Nothing says I love you like a check.

23:47.801 --> 23:50.350
So do you see anything
in the case you like?

23:50.512 --> 23:53.106
Sure. You should be very proud.

23:53.223 --> 23:56.853
Oh, I am. I am.
You can turn around now.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.951
Well, you're hiding.
What are you scared of out there?

24:05.027 --> 24:09.248
Just... I'm supposed to be doing
this super-smoking solo shot

24:09.406 --> 24:11.750
and it's not happening.

24:11.909 --> 24:15.379
- Well, you're in your own head.
-It's more complicated than that.

24:15.537 --> 24:17.130
It's really not and I'd listen to me

24:17.289 --> 24:18.757
because I play
in front of millions of people.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.544
- You don't have to do it in a thong.
- But I could.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.553
You want to know why?

24:23.712 --> 24:26.636
Because on the court is
where my head is clear.

24:29.551 --> 24:34.057
No second-guessing,
no BS in my brain driving me crazy.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.649
I'm on instinct.

24:38.769 --> 24:40.771
When is your head clear?

24:42.982 --> 24:44.780
When are you all instinct?

24:46.944 --> 24:48.571
Dancing.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.292
When I dance, I just go.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.257
So go.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.934
- They need water poolside.
- Okay.

25:18.100 --> 25:21.695
Oh, and you have to have
dinner here and ready in 30.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.950
Anything else?

25:28.277 --> 25:30.655
- No.
- Great.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.423
Are you sure I should
be taking these pictures?

25:41.540 --> 25:43.008
They're not on the shot list.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.886
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Olivia knows all about it.

25:46.045 --> 25:49.299
She said to make sure you send the
proofs to my personal email account.

25:49.423 --> 25:51.642
All right.

25:56.513 --> 25:59.892
- I don't want get in any trouble.
- Too late.

26:05.481 --> 26:08.280
So come over. I've got champagne
in my apartment, okay?

26:08.442 --> 26:11.070
Beach-side view.
You'll have a great time.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.829
Are you ready for round two?

26:12.988 --> 26:16.117
I'd like to try something different,
if that's okay.

26:16.283 --> 26:19.628
Yeah, it's okay.
This won't take long.

26:21.371 --> 26:22.839
Hey, how's it going?

26:22.998 --> 26:25.626
Well, the girls are set.
The routine is clean.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.295
We have all the months shot.

26:27.419 --> 26:31.299
Wait, sorry, February was a bust.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.968
Ahsha didn't get a picture?

26:34.134 --> 26:36.933
I know. I'm as shocked as you are.

26:37.096 --> 26:40.896
I can jump in and knock it out
if you want. It's your call, though.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.409
Looking hot there, girl.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.412
Yes, fantastic.

26:55.906 --> 26:58.876
- I love it.
- Work it.

26:59.034 --> 27:00.877
Good work.

27:06.333 --> 27:10.588
Yes, yes, yes, yes. That is perfect.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.734
There we go.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.414
Yes!

27:45.414 --> 27:50.841
So I moved back in with my mom
and started taking classes part time.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.847
Nights and weekends, you know?

27:54.006 --> 27:58.182
Then I got a job at the bank,
worked my butt off

27:58.302 --> 28:02.557
learning about permits
and licences and loans.

28:05.017 --> 28:08.146
Now I help people
start their own businesses.

28:09.730 --> 28:13.860
It's not flashy,
but it put a roof over our heads.

28:16.195 --> 28:20.621
I didn't do it in hot pants,
but I did it.

28:26.163 --> 28:28.131
I'm impressed.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.558
How do you want me
to handle Ahsha?

28:40.219 --> 28:43.018
- We're both gonna be at the arena.
- I know.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.274
It's not like
we can avoid each other.

28:45.432 --> 28:48.606
Yeah. You're just gonna have
to start from scratch.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.487
Just like me.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.082
I should get back to work.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.633
Yeah, I should go too.

29:30.227 --> 29:32.195
This was nice.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.676
The girls are in place for
the routine. We're ready to roll.

29:54.835 --> 29:56.633
Change of plans.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.173
This is what we're doing.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.058
- What?
- The dance. We're moving it.

30:02.217 --> 30:03.594
You can't. We're already set up.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.559
Hope you girls aren't afraid
of a little water.

32:13.849 --> 32:16.193
Well done, right on.

32:26.403 --> 32:30.203
You guys looked otherworldly.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.993
Sometimes, sharing the spotlight
isn't such a bad idea.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.379
Ahsha made you look good.

32:35.537 --> 32:38.040
I don't need Ahsha for that.

32:38.206 --> 32:41.631
Jelena, you keep taking out
everyone around you,

32:41.793 --> 32:46.219
and all that will be left is you
and, trust me, that's lonely.

32:48.258 --> 32:50.886
Thanks for the advice, Dr Phil.

32:53.054 --> 32:55.227
I went to Mia's apartment.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.941
Why would you go there?

33:00.061 --> 33:03.486
I think the better question is
why didn't I go there sooner?

33:08.487 --> 33:11.115
What was she into?

33:11.281 --> 33:14.660
What do you think she was into?
She wasn't the maid.

33:17.370 --> 33:19.122
Was she an escort?

33:22.292 --> 33:23.839
How long was this going on?

33:25.545 --> 33:27.172
Trust me.

33:27.339 --> 33:31.185
There was nothing you or
anyone else could've done to help Mia.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.911
Oh, wait.

33:53.073 --> 33:55.917
What? No thank you?

33:56.910 --> 33:58.503
Thanks, Coach.

33:59.663 --> 34:01.711
You killed it out there today.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.763
Why don't you stick around?

34:10.632 --> 34:12.726
We can celebrate.

34:13.885 --> 34:19.141
I'm going to celebrate tonight
at home with my boyfriend.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.859
Thanks again.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.205
Raquel.

34:43.873 --> 34:48.299
I may, at some point,
have suggested that...

34:49.337 --> 34:52.181
you maybe not return
as a Devil Girl.

34:58.013 --> 35:00.732
Thank you for being honest with me.

36:31.940 --> 36:36.036
Look, I know we talked about
moving in together

36:36.194 --> 36:40.620
and maybe this is happening
a lot sooner than we thought,

36:40.740 --> 36:42.367
but I love you.

36:44.411 --> 36:47.585
And I want you here for good.

36:52.293 --> 36:55.718
Besides, that thing is bolted
in my wall, so you can't leave.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.010
I would love to stay.

37:05.890 --> 37:08.609
Guess who learned
how to be sexy today?

37:13.398 --> 37:15.400
Girl.

38:02.071 --> 38:03.539
<i>Devil's operations.</i>

38:03.698 --> 38:06.326
<i>- Hi, it's</i> Jelena <i>Howard.
- Yes, Miss Howard.</i>

38:06.493 --> 38:09.337
Can I get the emergency contact
for Ahsha Hayes?

38:09.496 --> 38:13.296
<i>Certainly.
I have a Sloane Hayes, mother,</i>

38:13.458 --> 38:17.258
<i>and German Vega, boyfriend.
The numbers are--</i>

38:17.420 --> 38:20.048
Thank you. That's all I needed.

38:36.231 --> 38:37.608
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor.</i>

38:37.774 --> 38:40.948
Tomorrow you'll be performing
on the Santa Monica Pier

38:41.110 --> 38:44.239
and this Sunday is the formal
charity party and silent auction.

38:44.405 --> 38:45.952
Thomas Jefferson got picked
as one of the schools

38:46.115 --> 38:47.867
that's getting cash
for the Devils Charity Weekend.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.661
I don't remember hearing
anything about your school.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.956
