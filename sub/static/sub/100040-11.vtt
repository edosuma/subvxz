WEBVTT

00:11.177 --> 00:13.847
- Anything?
-Nope. Nobody knows squat.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.265
What the here is going on?

00:15.348 --> 00:17.642
We haven't had any new humans
to torture in a week.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.394
-I miss it.
-I know.

00:19.477 --> 00:22.022
I got so desperate this morning,
I tried flattening an eggplant.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.481
It's just not the same.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.483
Hey! Skin tags. Special meeting.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.193
-About what?
-I don't know.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.821
Probably your dad's stinky sack.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.575
I hope it's not
more sexual harassment training.

00:33.658 --> 00:36.911
We just did that.
And I'm already so good at it.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.498
Whoa! All right! We got 'em.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.333
Okay, here we go!

00:42.417 --> 00:45.587
Yeah. Uh, that's not exactly
what's happening here.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.089
The Bad Place is going to be changing,

00:48.173 --> 00:49.215
and I'm...

00:49.299 --> 00:51.301
Well, I'm kind of your boss now.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.928
He's joking, right?

00:54.012 --> 00:55.054
I'm afraid he's not.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.431
Things are changing.

00:56.514 --> 01:00.101
Michael and I
are actually going to be wor...

01:00.185 --> 01:01.936
Wor... Wor...

01:02.562 --> 01:03.980
Working... together.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.982
Ugh! Oh, I hated that.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.735
I hated saying it, hated how it felt,
hated all of it. Ew!

01:08.818 --> 01:10.111
You all have been hand-selected

01:10.195 --> 01:14.532
to be the very first Bad Place architects
who will learn the new system.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.201
Why do we need a new system?

01:16.284 --> 01:18.787
Torture works.
It's the way it's always been done.

01:18.870 --> 01:22.290
With all due respect,
"it's the way it's always been done,"

01:22.373 --> 01:24.918
is an excuse that's been used
for hundreds of years

01:25.001 --> 01:27.962
-to justify racism, misogyny--
- Exactly!

01:28.546 --> 01:30.673
See? This chick gets it.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.557
So, these computers have access

01:39.641 --> 01:42.936
to every file for every human
currently in the Bad Place.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.521
And the three of us
have a very important job.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.816
To find out which former US presidents
were secretly gay.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.526
-No.
-Okay, fine. Bi.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.110
Sure, but also,

01:51.194 --> 01:53.113
while Michael is trying
to get the architects trained,

01:53.196 --> 01:56.241
we're supposed to find
the first 1,000 humans to take the test.

01:56.324 --> 02:00.453
People who'll just sail right through it,
so we can build confidence in the system.

02:00.537 --> 02:01.412
So, what are the criteria?

02:01.496 --> 02:04.082
Should it be people
with the highest point totals,

02:04.165 --> 02:06.084
or overcame the greatest hardship?

02:06.167 --> 02:07.377
I think we just start with the gimmes.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.462
The very best people who ever lived, so...

02:10.046 --> 02:12.841
Evel Knievel, Kool-Aid Man, Mini-Me,

02:12.924 --> 02:16.553
DJ Jazzy Jeff...  A genie
so we could wish for infinity people...

02:16.636 --> 02:18.096
-Jason--
-Sure, throw me in there, too.

02:18.179 --> 02:21.099
Also, Fat Bastard,
The World's Most Interesting Man,

02:21.182 --> 02:23.101
Pikachu, Karate Kid,

02:23.184 --> 02:24.769
Wendy from Wendy's, Grumpy Cat,

02:24.853 --> 02:27.522
and the GPS lady
that tells you where to drive,.

02:28.022 --> 02:29.691
Feels like a good stopping point.

02:29.774 --> 02:31.734
Let's call it a day.
Come back fresh tomorrow.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.695
-Great job, everyone!
-What--

02:36.781 --> 02:41.161
Okay. Janet's passing out
the file on Tahani Al-Jamil,

02:41.244 --> 02:43.663
who volunteered
to be today's test subject.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.874
So, take a look and then we'll get going.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.333
They don't seem very enthused.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.377
This may be a tougher challenge
than I thought.

02:49.460 --> 02:52.213
Like when I tried to teach
Taylor Swift how to dance.

02:52.755 --> 02:54.424
The longest four years of my life.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.677
We're uprooting
the entire Bad Place system,

02:57.760 --> 03:00.054
and these architects
are set in their ways.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.140
It's gonna take a lot of work.

03:02.223 --> 03:05.018
But the work is the fun part, guys.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.853
So, no matter how long it takes,

03:06.936 --> 03:11.149
we'll see it through
and usher in a better, brighter future.

03:11.232 --> 03:14.319
Screw this.
I'm not working for a traitor.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.737
Phil out.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.405
That's my name, Phil.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.490
Oh, Phil. Hey. Come on, buddy.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.075
I personally chose you

03:21.159 --> 03:24.787
based on your innovative work in the
Performative Wokeness department.

03:24.871 --> 03:25.872
Wow.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.082
Way to mansplain my own department to me.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.918
And I'm triggered.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.630
Oh, man! What a legend!

03:33.713 --> 03:36.132
-Ooh. Who you reading about?
-Me.

03:36.215 --> 03:37.425
I ruled on Earth.

03:37.508 --> 03:39.969
I siphoned so much gas, Eleanor.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.096
Even if the car was moving,

03:42.180 --> 03:44.599
or on fire, or a boat,

03:44.682 --> 03:46.100
I still always got that gas.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.268
Oh, man.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.438
I never thought about the fact
that we could look up our own files.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.065
Yeah. I printed out all of ours.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.278
-I love you, okay?
-Oh.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.988
The words are nice, but the tone is scary.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.283
We're in love, and everything's great,
and if we wanna keep it that way,

04:02.367 --> 04:05.370
you have to promise
to never, ever, ever read my file.

04:05.453 --> 04:08.414
Okay, if you don't want me to,
then of course I won't,

04:08.498 --> 04:10.500
but nothing in there could ever change
how I feel about you.

04:10.583 --> 04:15.296
Eh. You say that now, but you don't know
what I did on Halloween 2013.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.131
What did you do on Halloween 2013?

04:17.215 --> 04:19.259
Oh, I don't remember,
but it must've been bad.

04:19.342 --> 04:22.428
Because the next morning, I woke up
in a large Rubbermaid container

04:22.512 --> 04:23.721
in some family's basement,

04:23.805 --> 04:25.807
and I'd barfed
all over their old photo albums.

04:26.891 --> 04:29.644
Yeah, see? That's the look
we're trying to avoid here, bud.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.354
I don't need to read your file.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.022
I know you.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.651
And I love you, and I can't wait
to spend eternity with you.

04:38.194 --> 04:41.990
I mean, obviously,
we have a lot of work to do here,

04:42.073 --> 04:43.491
and then we both have to pass the test.

04:43.574 --> 04:45.285
But, eventually,
we're gonna be together forever.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.327
You have to read my file right now.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.788
What? I'm confused. Is this a game?

04:49.831 --> 04:51.541
Is it a sex game, somehow?

04:51.624 --> 04:52.792
I can't risk it.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.378
What if we spend
half of eternity together,

04:55.461 --> 04:58.548
and then, you find out something
that does change the way you feel about me

04:58.631 --> 05:02.343
and then you resent me
for wasting half your eternity?

05:02.427 --> 05:04.721
No. It's better we just rip
the Band-Aid off

05:04.804 --> 05:07.515
and you read about all the bad stuff now,
when we're hot and heavy.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.809
-Okay. I'll read your file.
-Yeah.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.894
Can I finish reading
about Oskar Schindler first?

05:11.978 --> 05:16.899
That's who I gotta follow? The list guy?
You and I are so screwed, dude.

05:16.983 --> 05:20.194
<i>After as many attempts as it takes,</i>
<i>if your human passes the test</i>

05:20.278 --> 05:22.322
<i>and proves that they deserve</i>
<i>to go to the Good Place,</i>

05:22.405 --> 05:23.573
<i>you'll hear this sound.</i>

05:24.198 --> 05:26.117
<i>Good Place, here I come.</i>

05:26.200 --> 05:27.994
<i>This new system is great!</i>

05:28.077 --> 05:30.538
<i>Who do we have to thank</i>
<i>for effortlessly...</i>

05:30.621 --> 05:31.706
<i>implementing it?</i>

05:31.789 --> 05:34.751
<i>Whoever it is, I think we can all agree</i>
<i>it was a home run.</i>

05:35.335 --> 05:38.004
<i>It was me. Okay. Bye, everyone.</i>

05:38.087 --> 05:39.964
Sweet Hitler's hairpiece!

05:40.048 --> 05:41.716
Is this movie finally over?

05:41.799 --> 05:43.551
-It's basically over. Just one little--

05:44.135 --> 05:45.595
<i>♪ It's simply the test ♪</i>

05:49.015 --> 05:51.434
<i>♪ Better than other tests ♪</i>

05:52.769 --> 05:55.188
-I think we just...
-Okay. So, thoughts?

05:55.271 --> 05:58.232
Yeah. This all sounds so lame.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.069
No, it's the current system that's lame.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.320
It's so basic.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.238
You get a human's file,

06:04.322 --> 06:05.948
and let's be honest,
you never even read it.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.743
You just skip
to the "fears and phobias" section

06:08.826 --> 06:09.952
and use that to torture them.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.455
Fear of snakes? Throw 'em in a snake pit.

06:12.538 --> 06:16.042
Worried something's gonna happen
to your normal, cylindrical penis?

06:16.125 --> 06:16.959
Flatten it.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.628
This new way allows you

06:18.711 --> 06:22.465
to test their specific psychological flaws
and weaknesses.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.884
And trust us, they have plenty.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.345
-Hey!
-Sorry. I'm in selling mode.

06:27.428 --> 06:30.640
Guys, this is your chance
to be part of a bold, new future.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.726
Are you telling me
there's not one single demon

06:33.810 --> 06:38.147
who wants to design the very first
sample test of this new system?

06:38.231 --> 06:39.732
Oh, there is.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.193
And she's a stone-cold fox.

06:45.321 --> 06:46.906
Vicky, what are you doing here?

06:46.989 --> 06:51.077
Relax. I heard about the new system.
I love it, and I wanna be a part of it.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.371
Forgive me if I'm a little skeptical,

06:53.454 --> 06:57.083
given that you did once try to sabotage
my entire neighborhood.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.709
Look. After you blew me into goo,

06:58.793 --> 07:01.295
I had a lot of time to think
while my goo was reforming.

07:01.379 --> 07:05.091
If things are gonna change,
then I have to change along with them.

07:05.174 --> 07:09.512
And sure, change can be scary,
but... I'm an artist,

07:09.595 --> 07:12.849
which means, it's my job to be scared.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.143
- All right, fine, take a seat.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.103
Janet'll give you Tahani's file.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.479
Oh, no. I don't need her file.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.314
I know Tahani very well.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.901
Self-obsessed, family issues,
way too into being tall.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.820
Typical Vicky, throwing shade.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.614
But it doesn't matter,
'cause I'm casting it.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.325
Because I'm closer to the sun.

07:32.535 --> 07:33.369
I'm tall.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.708
Oh, no. I knew it.
You hate me now.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.627
What did it? That time I was subpoenaed
by the Make-A-Wish Foundation?

07:41.711 --> 07:44.005
-No.
-Oh, I know what it was.

07:44.088 --> 07:47.008
In my defense, I didn't realize
he was my boyfriend's twin

07:47.091 --> 07:48.593
until halfway into hooking up with him,

07:48.676 --> 07:51.304
and at that point, you know,
it's a sunk cost.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.263
I don't hate you at all.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.223
I mean, you were dealt
a pretty tough hand.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.225
You essentially had to raise yourself,

07:56.309 --> 08:00.480
but you were still more confident
and self-possessed at 13 than I ever was.

08:00.563 --> 08:04.442
I mean, seeing your whole life
all laid out like this, it's...

08:05.651 --> 08:06.486
It's remarkable.

08:07.069 --> 08:09.113
Okay, so you still love me.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.991
You're still horny for me,
blah, blah, blah...

08:12.074 --> 08:13.284
Then, what's wrong?

08:13.367 --> 08:15.036
I'm not good enough for you!

08:15.119 --> 08:16.704
I mean... Look at my file.

08:16.787 --> 08:21.459
It is one-tenth as long as yours,
because I did nothing with my life.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.170
Yeah, we're very different,
but we already knew that.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.671
-Why are you freaking out?

08:25.755 --> 08:27.757
You're cool, confident Chidi now,
remember?

08:27.840 --> 08:29.926
I am confident about my feelings for you.

08:30.009 --> 08:33.721
I am also confident that I am a damn drip,

08:33.804 --> 08:36.015
and you deserve to be with someone
who's not.

08:36.098 --> 08:39.185
Like Nicolas, that fireman
that you dated back in 2009?

08:39.268 --> 08:42.813
He rescued people from burning buildings,
and he was so hot!

08:42.897 --> 08:45.942
Oh, Nicolas the fireman...

08:46.567 --> 08:47.443
Mmm.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.362
Nicolas.

08:49.445 --> 08:52.198
I can't argue with you on that one, but...

08:52.657 --> 08:53.950
I love you.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.661
There's no one else I wanna be with.

08:56.744 --> 08:58.287
At least, not forever.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.998
I mean, if Frida Kahlo
wants to make out with me in heaven

09:01.082 --> 09:02.583
then you and I
are gonna have a conversation,

09:02.667 --> 09:07.129
but if you read my file and you're good,
then we're good.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.924
Unless there's something in your file
that would freak me out,

09:10.007 --> 09:12.134
like you kept out a library book
past the due date.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.469
What-- I moved!

09:13.553 --> 09:15.012
It got buried in the bottom of a box.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.556
I put the library in my will
to make up for it.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.682
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

09:17.765 --> 09:18.891
Relax.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.268
Let's get back to work.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.064
Now, when I press this lever,

09:25.147 --> 09:29.026
Tahani will enter the scenario
that Megan has designed

09:29.110 --> 09:31.487
that will test
her ethical decision-making.

09:31.571 --> 09:35.199
Obviously, in the real test, the humans
won't know they're being tested,

09:35.283 --> 09:37.743
but this should be a good practice run.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.161
Everyone ready?

09:43.666 --> 09:44.667
Hors d'oeuvre?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.961
Why, yes. Thank you.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.713
-Chainsaw bear!

09:51.132 --> 09:53.050
Okay, so, couple of things.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.470
We're not using chainsaw bears anymore,
remember?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.848
Right. Okay. Yeah.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.267
-What else?
-It was mainly that one thing.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.102
Why don't you try again?

10:03.185 --> 10:06.522
And remember that the challenges
your test subject faces

10:06.606 --> 10:09.191
should be smaller and more relatable.

10:10.026 --> 10:10.860
Okay.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.988
Hors d'oeuvre? It's salmon crudités.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.448
Is it farm-raised salmon?

10:15.531 --> 10:17.783
'Cause I prefer
to support sustainable fishing.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.286
Mondays, am I right?

10:20.369 --> 10:21.245
-Chainsaw!

10:22.538 --> 10:24.373
You said "smaller
and more relatable."

10:24.457 --> 10:28.127
The bear is smaller, humans hate Mondays
and love bacon.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.462
What do you want from me?

10:29.545 --> 10:31.631
Michael, can I try?

10:31.714 --> 10:33.049
I can show them what you're trying to do.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.468
Fine, Vicky, go ahead.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.764
Now, first, I need to
get into Tahani's headspace.

10:39.847 --> 10:40.890
Hello, love.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.142
Pish-posh, tuna and pickles.

10:43.225 --> 10:47.647
I once played billiards with
Questlove and Olivia Munn.

10:47.730 --> 10:48.773
Yeah, there she is.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.650
Okay, just give me a second.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.526
Ooh.

10:52.610 --> 10:55.446
Just finished reading up
about James Buchanan.

10:55.946 --> 11:00.117
Definitely at least a little bi.
I'm gonna put him in the maybe pile.

11:00.993 --> 11:04.038
I want nachos. Is there a snack bar here?

11:05.748 --> 11:06.874
What's going on, dawg?

11:06.957 --> 11:08.376
I know you're upset. You have a tell.

11:08.959 --> 11:09.877
-I do?
-Yeah.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.129
You told Eleanor before
that you were upset,

11:12.213 --> 11:13.381
and I think you still are.

11:13.464 --> 11:17.551
Looking at Eleanor's life
made me realize how different we are.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.096
If the system works,
and we both pass our tests,

11:20.179 --> 11:24.350
I don't see any version of eternity
where she doesn't get bored of me.

11:24.433 --> 11:27.186
I mean, my fake heaven
was a 600 square-foot apartment

11:27.269 --> 11:31.273
that was essentially a bookcase
and a toilet... and I loved it.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.318
So what? It's cool that you guys
are so different.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.695
Sometimes, two people
who have nothing in common

11:36.779 --> 11:39.740
get together, and it rules.
Opposites attract.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.201
Well, you need that to be true
because you're dating Janet.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.912
Ultimate opposites.

11:45.496 --> 11:49.500
So, what, are you saying...
Janet might get bored of me?

11:49.583 --> 11:51.836
No, that's not... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

11:51.919 --> 11:53.671
Man... Oh, no.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.464
No, Jason. Come back, I...

11:58.634 --> 12:00.761
I wish I were back in my toilet library.

12:01.262 --> 12:06.016
And places, and... action.

12:09.186 --> 12:12.106
Can you believe we're still having
this dinner for Kamilah?

12:12.189 --> 12:13.691
So embarrassing.

12:13.774 --> 12:14.984
She doesn't know this yet,

12:15.067 --> 12:17.987
but I heard that the reviews for
her new album are going to be dreadful.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.573
The rumor is that the label
is going to drop her.

12:20.656 --> 12:24.493
I heard she may have to fly home coach
and "check a bag,"

12:24.577 --> 12:25.786
-whatever that means.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.621
- Thank you, everyone,

12:27.705 --> 12:30.624
for coming
to celebrate our daughter Kamilah.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.252
I know you're all very busy these days.

12:33.335 --> 12:35.254
Just look at our other daughter, Tahani.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.006
She had to come straight from the gym.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.468
Would anyone like to say
a few words of praise

12:40.551 --> 12:44.472
about Kamilah's latest album,
or any other aspect of Kamilah?

12:44.555 --> 12:46.724
There are so many to celebrate.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.601
Perhaps Tahani should speak.

12:48.684 --> 12:53.230
She's had her share of failures recently.
Celebrating me could be therapeutic.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.901
Certainly. I can say something...

12:58.611 --> 12:59.945
but I have no idea what.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.656
Goodness, this is hard.

13:05.242 --> 13:08.496
Well done, Vicky.
That was quite good... for the system.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.080
For me, it was rather traumatic.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.666
Okay. It's like her parents
were the chainsaw bear,

13:12.750 --> 13:16.378
but instead of chopping off her head,
they chopped off her self-esteem?

13:16.462 --> 13:18.130
Yes! Megan, good.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.632
Take what you know about them,

13:19.715 --> 13:22.176
and then force them
into moments of personal difficulty.

13:22.259 --> 13:26.263
Think of it as, flattening the penises
of their heart.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.682
Oh! Now it makes sense.

13:28.766 --> 13:32.228
Why don't you go deeper into her file
and look for other ways to challenge her?

13:32.311 --> 13:33.437
No. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.064
Slow down. Slow down, here.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.107
Vicky's example was fine.

13:37.191 --> 13:39.193
There was some good stuff there.

13:39.276 --> 13:43.364
But overall... uh, C-plus.
It was a C-plus, I'd say.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.865
There's some problems with it.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.493
Some technical issues that only I can see
and everything,

13:47.576 --> 13:50.162
so, basically, it actually kinda stunk.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.790
So, I think it's just best
if you leave, Vicky.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.750
This is not working. You're bad at this.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.502
C-plus. Okay, goodbye.

13:56.585 --> 14:00.047
Wow. Same old Michael,
just can't share the spotlight.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.632
Well, goodbye, everyone.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.384
That's a wrap on Vicky.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.391
Michael, why did you fire Vicky?

14:10.474 --> 14:13.519
Look, I know she did well
on the first test.

14:13.602 --> 14:16.772
But it's beginners' luck.
There's an X factor here.

14:16.855 --> 14:20.568
Uh, a secret sauce that only I truly know
how to...

14:21.443 --> 14:25.281
pour over the juicy steak of this process.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.616
I've never said this before, but... what?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.451
Not only is Vicky good
at test design,

14:29.535 --> 14:31.036
but she's good at teaching the others.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.122
Well, that's the problem.
She's moving too fast.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.207
We have to learn how to walk
before we can run.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.960
So first you thought it would take
forever, and now it's moving too fast.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.962
First of all, you know, uh, shut up.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.089
And second of all, just shut up.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.383
-It's obvious what's going on here.

14:44.466 --> 14:47.845
You don't want your nemesis
to be the one to solve your problem.

14:47.928 --> 14:48.762
I know that feeling.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.974
Once on Earth, I didn't know something,
and I had to ask Alexa.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.559
I felt dirty.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.812
No, that's not it.

14:59.231 --> 15:03.444
I'm upset, because for hundreds of years,
I've had a job.

15:03.527 --> 15:06.822
First, it was finding a better way
to torture humans,

15:06.906 --> 15:10.701
then helping them,
then proving the system was broken,

15:10.784 --> 15:12.286
then teaching the demons.

15:12.369 --> 15:16.498
I had to roll a rock up a hill,
over and over.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.501
And then it kept rolling down,
so I had to do it again.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.046
And then Vicky comes along with this...

15:22.963 --> 15:27.885
like, rock-lifter thing,
and just lifts it to the top of the hill.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.763
Pushing the rock up the hill
gave me a purpose.

15:31.764 --> 15:32.598
Who am I...

15:33.933 --> 15:35.809
if the rock's gone?

15:36.727 --> 15:39.521
Ironically, that's exactly
what Vin Diesel asked me

15:39.605 --> 15:42.691
when Dwayne Johnson refused to appear
in <i>Fast & Furious 9.</i>

15:43.692 --> 15:46.111
Not helpful? Copy that.

15:46.820 --> 15:50.240
Honestly, Michael, I don't know
what's to become of you,

15:50.324 --> 15:51.617
or any of us.

15:51.700 --> 15:55.329
But getting Vicky back is the best chance
to make your plan work now.

15:55.412 --> 15:59.249
So focus on that,
and deal with the future in the future.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.086
Hey...

16:02.586 --> 16:03.420
Um...

16:05.005 --> 16:08.425
I'm sorry I said that before, man.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.552
No, you were right.

16:10.636 --> 16:14.723
Janet and I are different.
Maybe it can't last.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.559
Maybe we're like
the Montagues and Capulets.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.686
How do you know that?

16:18.769 --> 16:22.022
I read some books, man! Jeez.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.691
All right, listen.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.028
Maybe on paper,
you and Janet don't make total sense,

16:28.112 --> 16:29.029
but who cares?

16:29.113 --> 16:32.616
The relationship you have built together
is wonderful.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.995
She knows you and loves you,
and that's all that matters.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.998
-Do you really believe that?
-Of course I do.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.291
Sucker!

16:42.584 --> 16:45.004
-Sorry?
-I got you so bad.

16:45.087 --> 16:48.924
Dude, pretend what you just said
was what you said to you instead of to me.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.801
And you have to listen to yourself,

16:50.884 --> 16:53.637
because it was already in your own head,
and then came out.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.431
But just put it back in your head,

16:55.514 --> 17:00.227
and realize that it was you
talking about you and Eleanor.

17:00.978 --> 17:07.026
Against all odds, I know what you mean,
and I gotta give it up. That was...

17:07.651 --> 17:09.570
-That was good.
-Yeah, it was.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.488
Chess-mate.

17:17.077 --> 17:17.995
Hey!

17:18.579 --> 17:19.455
There she is.

17:19.538 --> 17:23.834
-Where are you off to?
-I have an ice-cold yoga class.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.587
-It's amazing. You pull so many muscles.
-Yeah.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.172
What do you want?

17:29.381 --> 17:31.508
I'm sorry that I kicked you out.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.218
It wasn't about you.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.138
It was just my own insecurities
getting in the way.

17:37.097 --> 17:38.390
Will you please come back?

17:39.224 --> 17:40.267
No.

17:40.350 --> 17:43.062
I'm not gonna let myself
be degraded by you again.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.939
I am a strong, independent acid snake

17:46.023 --> 17:48.776
in the skinsuit
of a strong, independent woman.

17:48.859 --> 17:49.818
Listen, listen, listen.
Uh...

17:51.904 --> 17:54.448
You were the best part
of my original neighborhood.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.992
I took you for granted,
and that was wrong.

17:57.951 --> 18:00.829
But now, I want to give you
the role of a lifetime.

18:01.663 --> 18:04.416
You're going to run the whole project.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.002
I'll give you all my plans and my notes,

18:07.086 --> 18:09.713
but then I'll step back
and you'll take over.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.132
Full creative control...

18:12.925 --> 18:13.759
like a director.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.220
-What do you say?
-Well, um...

18:17.221 --> 18:18.055
It sounds great.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.264
But it won't work.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.183
Everyone here hates you so much,

18:21.266 --> 18:23.936
if you just put me in control,
they'll think I'm your puppet.

18:24.019 --> 18:26.271
I can't have any of your
dingleberry stank on me.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.858
I know.
That's why I'm not giving it to you.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.111
You're going to take it.

18:33.570 --> 18:34.738
Hey.

18:34.822 --> 18:41.537
So, uh, I was being stupid,
and Jason gave me some really good advice.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.871
Classic us.

18:42.955 --> 18:48.710
Look, who we were on Earth
is a tiny part of who we are,

18:48.794 --> 18:51.630
and an even smaller part
of who we are together.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.882
So, I'm sorry for freaking out.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.510
But also,
someday, when we get to the Good Place,

18:56.593 --> 18:59.388
I'm gonna learn to play the guitar
so you don't get bored of me.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.515
I actually prefer drummers.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.684
Read my file.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.354
Sorry for the delay.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.731
Now, for this next phase of the training--

19:09.815 --> 19:13.026
-Stop right there.
-Vicky? I thought I got rid of you.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.113
And now you're coming
through the door unexpectedly?

19:16.196 --> 19:18.448
That's right. I'm launching a coup.

19:18.532 --> 19:22.077
My, my, my, we've got some history,
don't we?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.538
But I'm still standing, Mikey-boy.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.915
And right now, I'm taking over.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.960
Explain what you mean,
for me and everyone else.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.254
Oh, this is my training now. You're done.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.882
And all of these demons are behind me,
right, guys?

19:34.965 --> 19:38.927
-All right, Vicky. You win... this time.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.679
-Tahani, Janet, let's go.
- Huh.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.515
Well, no, but wait...
Wait, we're still fighting.

19:43.599 --> 19:47.269
And it's so heated
that, um, it might just erupt into...

19:48.437 --> 19:50.355
the dance battle from <i>West Side Story?</i>

19:50.939 --> 19:53.233
No, I'm too upset about the coup thing.

19:53.817 --> 19:56.111
Hurry up. Before she starts singing.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.741
Welcome! Welcome, everyone!
Come on in.

20:00.824 --> 20:04.453
Good Place architects to my left,
Bad Place architects to my right.

20:04.536 --> 20:09.333
Get your files and orientation packets.
Classes begin in 30 minutes.

20:12.211 --> 20:16.465
Oh, also, my Movement
for Lava Monsters class is now full.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.383
Aw, man!

20:19.259 --> 20:22.721
You got the rock up the hill,
and it looks like it's gonna stay there.

20:23.430 --> 20:24.932
Now, we just have to find your next rock.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.393
Well, the first bunch of neighborhoods
is up and running.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.145
What now?

20:30.729 --> 20:32.814
That's the sound
when someone gets into the Good Place.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.234
Who was it? Prince? It's gotta be Prince.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.818
Honestly, if it wasn't Prince,

20:36.902 --> 20:38.445
this whole thing is screwed up
and we gotta start over.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.573
No. It's you guys.

20:42.783 --> 20:43.617
For real?

20:43.700 --> 20:47.287
The Judge agreed that the four of you
don't need to take the test.

20:47.371 --> 20:50.749
Turns out that saving every soul
in the universe

20:50.832 --> 20:52.417
is worth a few points.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.671
-You're in.

21:02.761 --> 21:05.305
No, I know. I know. It's real this time.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.223
I promise.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.142
Get in.

21:09.977 --> 21:10.978
Are you coming, too?

21:11.061 --> 21:12.813
Yeah. I figured I would.

21:13.563 --> 21:16.984
Recently unemployed. Might as well
do some traveling.

21:17.067 --> 21:17.901
Shall we?

21:22.155 --> 21:23.657
- Whoa!

21:28.078 --> 21:30.205
Foles!
