01:00.934 --> 01:04.937
628 Tremont. 6-2-8. Three dead.

01:04.938 --> 01:07.773
No, just the usual. Fuck. Usual.

01:07.774 --> 01:09.567
It's no big deal these days, right?

01:09.568 --> 01:11.235
- Some guy-- What's his name?
- I don't know.

01:11.236 --> 01:13.946
Oh, who knows his name?
Who cares?

01:13.947 --> 01:17.950
Fucking' shoots his wife and kid,
and then eats the fucking licorice.

01:17.951 --> 01:20.786
Sticks it in his mouth
and blows his own brains out.

01:22.164 --> 01:23.956
- This guy had no ID--
- Shit.

01:23.957 --> 01:26.042
...no fucking papers.

01:26.043 --> 01:28.294
Probably squirreled
over the goddamn border.

01:28.295 --> 01:30.171
Hey, guys. Channel 10 News.

01:30.172 --> 01:31.964
Listen, you're kind of blocking our shot.

01:31.965 --> 01:33.591
- Can I get you to move forward a bit?
- Yeah, sure.

01:33.592 --> 01:35.051
Thanks. You ready?

01:35.052 --> 01:37.220
Yeah. Almost. Two minutes.

01:37.221 --> 01:40.306
Let's grab some more B-roll.

01:40.307 --> 01:42.225
Can't get close enough for an Emmy.

01:42.226 --> 01:44.602
Screw the Emmy.
I'd settle for a fucking paycheck.

01:44.603 --> 01:45.978
Story of my life.

01:45.979 --> 01:47.980
We downloaded this video off the Net

01:47.981 --> 01:49.982
sometime over the last three days.

01:49.983 --> 01:51.776
I can't remember exactly when.

01:51.777 --> 01:53.194
Look at this guy.

01:53.195 --> 01:55.321
Look at this fucking guy.

01:55.322 --> 01:58.157
Chowing down while his buddies are
shoving a corpse in the back of the van.

01:58.158 --> 01:59.992
- Okay, I'm ready. Let's do it.
- Some of this footage

01:59.993 --> 02:01.702
- was never broadcast.
- Am I good?

02:01.703 --> 02:04.497
It was secretly uploaded
by the cameraman who shot it.

02:04.498 --> 02:06.540
- It was his way of trying to--
- She's alive.

02:06.541 --> 02:09.001
...tell the truth
about what was happening.

02:09.002 --> 02:11.212
Bree Reno reporting live from Homestead,

02:11.213 --> 02:14.006
where tragedy befell
an immigrant family.

02:14.007 --> 02:15.591
An unidentified man has shot

02:15.592 --> 02:18.469
his wife and 16-year-old son
to death

02:18.470 --> 02:21.514
- before turning the gun on himself.
- Hey, what's going on?

02:21.515 --> 02:23.432
- Jesus!
- What?

02:23.433 --> 02:24.558
- I don't believe this.
- What?

02:24.559 --> 02:25.810
Is there something with the camera?

02:25.811 --> 02:28.020
- Just fix it.
- She's still moving.

02:28.021 --> 02:30.523
Oh, for Christ's sake, Brody.
I'm right in the middle of a--

02:30.524 --> 02:32.817
- What?
- Jesus-fucking-Christ!

02:32.818 --> 02:35.027
- For God's sakes!
- What the hell is going on over there?

02:35.028 --> 02:37.697
- I thought they were dead.
- They're supposed to be. They are--

02:37.698 --> 02:40.491
I don't know! She's moving
on the frickin' gurney, man!

02:40.492 --> 02:42.326
Get out of the way!
Come on! Get out of the way!

02:42.327 --> 02:45.663
Backup here! Backup here!

02:45.664 --> 02:48.040
- Aah!
- Get off of him!

02:48.041 --> 02:49.750
He all right?

02:49.751 --> 02:52.420
Jesus! What the fuck is that?

02:52.421 --> 02:54.046
Just keep still.

02:54.047 --> 02:58.175
The other one's moving!

02:59.177 --> 03:01.929
The other one's coming up, too!

03:01.930 --> 03:05.057
No!

03:05.058 --> 03:10.058
- Take him out!

03:11.315 --> 03:13.816
He's not going down!

03:13.817 --> 03:16.819
He's not going down!

03:17.821 --> 03:20.948
Holy shit!

03:20.949 --> 03:22.950
Bree!

03:22.951 --> 03:27.079
- Shoot her in the head!

03:27.080 --> 03:29.373
No. No.

03:29.374 --> 03:31.083
This can't be happening.

03:31.084 --> 03:33.085
This can't be fucking happening!

03:36.965 --> 03:38.549
We downloaded
a lot of what we found

03:38.550 --> 03:41.177
on television, on the Net, off blogs--

03:41.178 --> 03:44.388
images and commentary
over those first three days.

03:44.389 --> 03:46.182
Most of it was bullshit.

03:46.183 --> 03:47.975
None of it was useful.

03:47.976 --> 03:50.603
This is what we were getting
from the news networks.

03:50.604 --> 03:52.355
None of us can claim to know

03:52.356 --> 03:55.024
exactly what has caused the chaos
we've been experiencing.

03:55.025 --> 03:56.233
Some kind of germ.
Some kind of epidemic.

03:56.234 --> 03:57.360
A natural calamity or--

03:57.361 --> 03:59.278
You can't talk about it
being an epidemic.

03:59.279 --> 04:01.572
You talk about it being an epidemic,
there's gonna be panic in the streets.

04:01.573 --> 04:03.991
I'm old enough to remember
Orson Welles' War of the Worlds,

04:03.992 --> 04:06.369
possibly the greatest hoax
every perpetrated.

04:06.370 --> 04:08.329
- There's a dead guy sitting up!
- And that was when it was just radio.

04:08.330 --> 04:10.206
Now it's 24/7.

04:10.207 --> 04:11.290
This is some kind of hoax.

04:13.543 --> 04:15.544
This is ridiculous!

04:15.545 --> 04:18.505
People are
willing to believe almost anything.

04:18.507 --> 04:20.048
We made a film--

04:20.050 --> 04:22.051
the one I'm going to show you now.

04:22.052 --> 04:26.389
Actually, Jason was the one
who wanted to make it.

04:26.390 --> 04:29.016
Like that cameraman from Channel 10,

04:29.017 --> 04:32.228
he wanted to upload it
so that people-- you--

04:32.229 --> 04:34.230
could be told the truth.

04:34.231 --> 04:37.733
The film was shot
with a Panasonic HDX-900

04:37.734 --> 04:39.693
and an HBX-200.

04:39.694 --> 04:42.738
I did the final cut on Jason's laptop.

04:42.739 --> 04:47.618
I've added music occasionally
for effect, hoping to scare you.

04:47.619 --> 04:50.329
You see, in addition to trying
to tell you the truth,

04:50.330 --> 04:52.706
I am hoping to scare you

04:52.707 --> 04:56.419
so that maybe you'll wake up.

04:56.420 --> 05:00.256
Maybe you won't make any of
the same mistakes that we made.

05:00.257 --> 05:03.926
Anyway, here it is, Jason Creed's

05:03.927 --> 05:08.927
The Death of Death.

05:29.202 --> 05:34.202
- Aah!

05:35.167 --> 05:37.042
No. Cut, cut.

05:37.043 --> 05:39.128
- Cut.
- Come on!

05:39.129 --> 05:41.005
How many times have I told you?

05:41.006 --> 05:43.007
Dead things don't move fast.

05:43.008 --> 05:44.508
You're a corpse, for Christ's sakes.

05:44.509 --> 05:47.136
If you run that fast,
your ankles are gonna snap off.

05:47.137 --> 05:48.971
If she's going fast, I have to go fast,

05:48.972 --> 05:50.681
otherwise, how
am I supposed to catch her?

05:50.682 --> 05:53.100
You're supposed to catch her later.

05:53.101 --> 05:54.810
This is the beginning
of the fucking movie.

05:54.811 --> 05:56.812
You catch her now, it's all over.

05:56.813 --> 05:59.690
All you're supposed to do
is grab her dress so--

05:59.691 --> 06:02.610
So my tits fall out?
Ain't gonna happen.

06:02.611 --> 06:04.320
You know, can somebody
please explain to me

06:04.321 --> 06:07.156
why girls in scary movies
always have to, like,

06:07.157 --> 06:09.658
fall down and lose
their shoes and shit?

06:09.659 --> 06:12.328
It's totally lame.

06:12.329 --> 06:14.330
And why do we always have
to get our dresses torn off?

06:14.331 --> 06:16.123
Actually, I'm looking forward to that part.

06:16.124 --> 06:18.125
- Flashing.
- I swear.

06:18.126 --> 06:20.252
- Thanks.
- Should've stuck with auto repair.

06:20.253 --> 06:23.088
Aw, shit, man. Look at this.
Your makeup's all unglued.

06:23.089 --> 06:25.424
Give me a break.

06:25.425 --> 06:28.135
Yeah, maybe you can see it now
because you're in way too tight.

06:28.136 --> 06:29.887
All he's supposed to do
is run through the fucking shot.

06:29.888 --> 06:32.556
No, not run. Shamble.

06:32.557 --> 06:35.726
The script says, "The mummy
shambles into frame and stops."

06:35.727 --> 06:37.895
For a second. For one second.

06:37.896 --> 06:39.563
You're telling me
in one second you can see--

06:39.564 --> 06:40.689
The camera can see.

06:40.690 --> 06:43.234
And what the camera sees,
the audience will see.

06:43.235 --> 06:44.527
What fucking audience?

06:44.528 --> 06:47.404
There's always an audience for horror--
believable horror.

06:47.405 --> 06:50.533
But who's gonna believe a mummy
if his makeup's all unglued?

06:50.534 --> 06:53.035
Who's gonna believe
a mummy in the first place?

06:53.036 --> 06:55.204
Here's a thought, genius--
try zooming out.

06:55.205 --> 06:56.664
Maybe your fucking shot will work.

06:56.665 --> 06:59.124
I know what I want here, Tony,
and I know what I'm doing.

06:59.125 --> 07:00.918
That's right. You do, don't you?

07:00.919 --> 07:04.672
We're only, what, four days over
a three-day shooting schedule?

07:04.673 --> 07:06.674
Guys, there's something weird going on.

07:06.675 --> 07:09.134
Don't even get fucking credits
for what we're doing out here.

07:09.135 --> 07:11.178
You'll all be in the credits.

07:11.179 --> 07:12.680
I'm talking about college credits.

07:12.681 --> 07:15.307
Leave those to me.

07:15.308 --> 07:17.101
Did we get the shot yet?

07:17.102 --> 07:18.686
No, we're still clicking around.

07:18.687 --> 07:23.566
Five credits for each of you.
That is a pledge.

07:23.567 --> 07:26.318
Mr. Creed has a vision.

07:26.319 --> 07:28.487
Hey, I'm just trying to make
a scary movie here.

07:28.488 --> 07:29.613
Yes, you are, Mr. Creed.

07:29.614 --> 07:30.781
Jason always wanted to be

07:30.782 --> 07:32.825
a documentary filmmaker.

07:32.826 --> 07:34.702
But for his senior class project,

07:34.703 --> 07:37.705
he decided to try to make a horror film.

07:37.706 --> 07:41.041
That's what he was shooting
on that first night,

07:41.042 --> 07:44.712
the night when... everything changed.

07:44.713 --> 07:46.422
Stupid fucking mummy movie.

07:46.423 --> 07:49.466
With an underlying thread
of social satire.

07:49.467 --> 07:52.720
Jason, can I take a minute?
I have to pee.

07:52.721 --> 07:54.638
- Shit!
- Uh, Jason?

07:54.639 --> 07:56.765
- What?
- I have to pee, too.

07:56.766 --> 07:58.183
Jesus Christ!

07:58.184 --> 07:59.977
This whole thing is falling apart.

08:01.438 --> 08:02.730
There's something on the news.

08:02.731 --> 08:05.733
It's pretty-- Well, I mean...

08:05.734 --> 08:07.735
you might wanna check this out.

08:07.736 --> 08:10.195
It's difficult for us
to believe what we've been reporting,

08:10.196 --> 08:11.739
but it does seem to be happening.

08:11.740 --> 08:15.659
Two news agencies in two separate
counties in the Tri-State area

08:15.660 --> 08:19.455
are reporting accounts
of the dead returning to life.

08:19.456 --> 08:21.749
In one of the cases--
the one in Somerset--

08:21.750 --> 08:25.753
the dead man, identified
as a 50-year-old white male,

08:25.754 --> 08:28.631
the victim of
a drive-by shooting yesterday,

08:28.632 --> 08:31.759
sat up on an autopsy table
and actually attacked

08:31.760 --> 08:33.052
Somerset medical examiner
Thomas Maitland--

08:33.053 --> 08:35.763
- Horseshit.
- Shut up, Tony. It's on the fucking news.

08:35.764 --> 08:38.140
The news is always horseshit.

08:38.140 --> 08:40.768
Always make things sound worse
than they really are.

08:40.769 --> 08:43.895
That's how they sell soap.
The next morning, what happens?

08:43.897 --> 08:45.773
"Oh, sorry. Our mistake."

08:45.774 --> 08:48.484
I mean, seriously, who's gonna believe
this shit? Two dead people--

08:48.485 --> 08:51.487
Now five dead people.
And here's another.

08:51.488 --> 08:53.072
They're coming in from everywhere.

08:53.073 --> 08:56.784
A corpse at Hope Memorial
has apparently revived.

08:56.785 --> 08:58.744
That's six separate reports--

08:58.745 --> 09:00.996
Six? How could there be
six mistakes?

09:00.997 --> 09:03.832
For Christ's sake,
we hear this sort of thing every day.

09:03.833 --> 09:07.211
We got hurricanes
'cause the planet's getting too hot.

09:07.212 --> 09:09.213
And terrorists--
They're gonna drop a dirty bomb

09:09.214 --> 09:11.507
on the White House
or on your house.

09:11.508 --> 09:15.636
And somebody's gonna put some germ
in your water or in your mailbox.

09:15.637 --> 09:17.805
That letter from
Publishers Clearing House, huh?

09:17.806 --> 09:19.807
Good news is
you won a million bucks.

09:19.808 --> 09:22.726
Bad news is you're gonna
wake up dead tomorrow morning.

09:22.727 --> 09:24.311
Better believe what we've just heard.

09:24.312 --> 09:28.273
The problem doesn't seem to be
that people are waking up dead,

09:28.274 --> 09:30.234
but that dead people are waking up.

09:30.235 --> 09:32.778
Shh! Listen.

09:32.779 --> 09:35.364
- What's that?
- What was that?

09:35.365 --> 09:38.242
If this is some kind of Halloween prank

09:38.243 --> 09:40.202
or some sort of hoax,

09:40.203 --> 09:42.621
a lot of people are in on it,

09:42.622 --> 09:44.540
- including officials--
- I'm out of here.

09:44.541 --> 09:49.541
If I'm gonna wake up dead,
it's gonna be in my own bedroom.

09:49.838 --> 09:51.630
You can all come.

09:51.631 --> 09:53.966
Eliot has the address.
He knows where it is.

09:53.967 --> 09:55.884
Yeah. Nice place, too.

09:55.885 --> 09:58.554
Cozy. Takes up
about half of Philadelphia.

09:58.555 --> 10:00.013
Yeah, it's a fucking fortress.

10:00.014 --> 10:02.850
I can't get in unless I'm invited.

10:02.851 --> 10:04.810
Sorry, Jason, about your movie.

10:04.811 --> 10:06.812
I don't mean to hang
you up or anything,

10:06.813 --> 10:11.813
but I'm getting the fuck out of here.

10:13.695 --> 10:16.822
Like I said, you can all come.

10:16.823 --> 10:18.824
I mean it. It's an invitation.

10:18.825 --> 10:20.159
Late this afternoon,

10:20.160 --> 10:21.493
the cadaver began to move.

10:21.494 --> 10:23.871
- I'm in.
- Showed no vital signs,

10:23.872 --> 10:26.331
- but it opened its eyes--
- Anyone else?

10:26.332 --> 10:28.500
- Apparently not.
- How is that possible?

10:28.501 --> 10:30.169
The man must not have been dead.

10:30.170 --> 10:33.630
Not only dead. Partially dissected.

10:33.631 --> 10:38.631
BYE, guys.

10:38.887 --> 10:41.513
Fuckin' mummies get all the girls.

10:41.514 --> 10:44.767
So...what are we gonna do?

10:44.768 --> 10:46.769
The cadaver began to move.

10:46.770 --> 10:48.353
But how do you explain--

10:48.354 --> 10:50.272
As a medical man,
I have no explanation.

10:50.273 --> 10:51.899
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.066
I'm gonna go to the dorm.

10:53.067 --> 10:55.819
Deb's there. Whatever's happening,
I don't want her to be alone.

10:55.820 --> 10:59.907
...able to transmit electrical impulses

10:59.908 --> 11:03.827
strong enough to animate
what little remained

11:03.828 --> 11:05.913
of the body's muscle and tissue.

11:10.919 --> 11:12.711
Okay,

11:12.712 --> 11:17.712
Okay, this is the women's dorm.

11:20.929 --> 11:23.931
Jesus!

11:23.932 --> 11:27.351
It's been 25 minutes
since we heard the news.

11:27.352 --> 11:32.352
It already looks
like everybody's gone.

11:38.947 --> 11:42.574
Hello. Who's in there?

11:42.575 --> 11:45.410
Oh, man.

11:45.411 --> 11:48.205
What the fuck are you doing here?

11:48.206 --> 11:51.458
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I'm just stealing shit.

11:51.459 --> 11:53.335
But you--

11:53.336 --> 11:57.965
What's a guy with a video camera
doing in the women's dorm, huh?

11:57.966 --> 11:59.675
Security!

11:59.676 --> 12:02.427
Heh heh heh heh!

12:02.428 --> 12:04.555
Oh, man.

12:04.556 --> 12:06.974
Oh, God.

12:06.975 --> 12:11.975
Oh, shit.

12:15.984 --> 12:17.734
Okay. Okay.

12:17.735 --> 12:22.735
This is Deb's room.

12:23.283 --> 12:25.284
Oh, Jesus!
It's okay, Deb! It's me.

12:25.285 --> 12:27.995
Jesus-fucking...

12:27.996 --> 12:29.788
Are you still shooting?

12:29.789 --> 12:34.789
- Why are you shooting?
- I'm just--

12:34.961 --> 12:37.004
We have reports coming in from Denver.

12:37.005 --> 12:38.422
Oh, my God.

12:40.383 --> 12:43.802
- God, I'm so freaked.
- It's okay, babe.

12:43.803 --> 12:45.470
We have incredible footage
from Channel 10.

12:45.471 --> 12:47.222
I'm here. I'm here.

12:47.223 --> 12:51.059
I've been trying to call home
for, like, an hour.

12:51.060 --> 12:54.354
First exclusive footage that
shows evidence of dead people,

12:54.355 --> 12:58.191
or supposedly dead people, reviving.

13:00.028 --> 13:03.322
Jesus! What the fuck is that?

13:03.323 --> 13:05.324
Oh, my God.
The other one's coming up, too.

13:05.325 --> 13:07.993
' Shit! Shit!

13:07.994 --> 13:10.454
Same fucking thing!
No answer!

13:10.455 --> 13:13.081
- Gotta get out there. I'm missing everything.
- Babe.

13:13.082 --> 13:15.417
- What?
- There's no answer at my house.

13:15.418 --> 13:18.754
My morn, my dad, Billy--
They're supposed to be there.

13:18.755 --> 13:20.839
- Maybe they're up at the cabin.
- No, I already tried there.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.507
And their cell.

13:22.508 --> 13:24.051
He was walking really strange.

13:24.052 --> 13:25.427
Due to unusual volume,

13:25.428 --> 13:27.346
your call did not
go through as dialed.

13:27.347 --> 13:31.058
Circuits are busy. Your folks probably
can't get through to you, either.

13:31.059 --> 13:32.851
It was all over the news,

13:32.852 --> 13:34.645
all over the Web,

13:34.646 --> 13:36.897
but no one knew
what was really happening.

13:36.898 --> 13:39.524
I want to get out of here.

13:39.525 --> 13:43.445
Jay, I want to go home.

13:43.446 --> 13:46.031
He shot Ben!

13:46.032 --> 13:48.575
I think that's what started the panic--

13:48.576 --> 13:50.494
not knowing the truth.

13:50.495 --> 13:52.037
We're in a war zone,

13:52.038 --> 13:54.081
but I don't know who the war is with.

13:54.082 --> 13:56.208
What's been happening
is real, not a hoax,

13:56.209 --> 13:58.835
and prospects truly are terrifying.

13:58.836 --> 14:00.087
All my friends left

14:00.088 --> 14:01.630
before we could even say good-bye.

14:01.631 --> 14:04.007
- ...numbers of citizens--
- We want everyone to remain calm.

14:04.008 --> 14:07.469
It's funny. You spend so much time
resenting your parents,

14:07.470 --> 14:09.972
separating yourself,
building your own life.

14:09.973 --> 14:12.015
But as soon as
the shit hits the fan,

14:12.016 --> 14:17.016
the only place
you want to go is home.

14:19.232 --> 14:21.108
We're in Mary's Winnebago,

14:21.109 --> 14:22.401
trying to stick together.

14:22.402 --> 14:25.278
- What is this about, Jason?
- I don't know. I just--

14:25.279 --> 14:26.697
If this turns out to be a big thing,

14:26.698 --> 14:28.657
I just want to record it, okay?

14:28.658 --> 14:30.826
Come on. Everybody,
when it comes to you, say your name.

14:30.827 --> 14:35.455
This is ridiculous.

14:35.456 --> 14:37.749
Mary. Mary Dexter.

14:37.750 --> 14:39.501
And what are you doing here, Mary?

14:39.502 --> 14:41.336
Um, going home.

14:41.337 --> 14:44.297
Trying to go home.

14:44.298 --> 14:47.926
Can you just not film me while
I'm driving, please, so I can focus?

14:47.927 --> 14:49.136
- Say your name.
- Jason,

14:49.137 --> 14:50.637
if you don't know by name by now,

14:50.638 --> 14:52.389
then get your clothes
out of my closet, okay?

14:52.390 --> 14:57.390
- Come on, babe. It's part of history.
- His--

14:57.895 --> 14:59.896
Debra Moynahan.

14:59.897 --> 15:03.233
And I'm just trying to get home,
too, okay? Like Mary.

15:03.234 --> 15:08.234
And I'm wondering why my boyfriend
has a camera plastered to his face.

15:08.906 --> 15:10.782
Scranton, okay?

15:10.783 --> 15:14.077
Scranton, Pennsylvania.
That's my home.

15:14.078 --> 15:16.079
My parents' home.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.664
And my little brother's.

15:17.665 --> 15:19.666
Where are you coming from?

15:19.667 --> 15:21.460
College.

15:21.461 --> 15:23.879
We're all at Pitt together.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.797
University of Pittsburgh.

15:25.798 --> 15:28.216
- Why are we on the road?
- Christ.

15:28.217 --> 15:31.303
Yeah. Christ, Jason. Lay the fuck off.

15:31.304 --> 15:32.387
See this guy?

15:32.388 --> 15:35.724
He won't say who he is, so I will.
He's Tony Ravello, he's from--

15:35.725 --> 15:37.893
Where is it? Brooklyn? Or the Bronx?

15:37.894 --> 15:39.144
Queens.

15:39.145 --> 15:41.730
He does makeup that comes unglued.

15:41.731 --> 15:45.067
You know what?
I'm a directing major, just like you.

15:45.068 --> 15:46.693
I wasn't even supposed
to do makeup.

15:46.694 --> 15:48.904
No, I was.

15:48.905 --> 15:50.238
Sorry, babe.

15:50.239 --> 15:52.449
You know what happens
when we try to work together.

15:52.450 --> 15:57.450
I hear that.

15:58.164 --> 16:00.290
What are we doing
out here on the road?

16:00.291 --> 16:02.918
Uh, just trying to get
out of Dodge right now.

16:02.919 --> 16:04.836
Why?

16:04.837 --> 16:06.838
What do you want me to say, Jason?

16:06.839 --> 16:08.423
It's not what I want you to say.

16:08.424 --> 16:10.926
It's what you want to say. Tell us.

16:10.927 --> 16:13.428
Why does everyone want
to get the hell out of Dodge?

16:13.429 --> 16:14.930
'Cause of this thing--

16:14.931 --> 16:17.307
- this crazy thing that's happening.
- It is crazy.

16:17.308 --> 16:18.934
Where are you going, Tony?

16:18.935 --> 16:21.728
Nowhere. No place to go.

16:21.729 --> 16:25.398
So I'm just gonna hang with you, Jason,
until I can't take any more of your shit.

16:25.399 --> 16:26.733
- Got it.
- Will you explain

16:26.734 --> 16:28.318
why the Department
of Homeland Security

16:28.319 --> 16:31.738
suddenly raised its alert level
to orange earlier this evening,

16:31.739 --> 16:35.158
even though there are no indications
of a terrorist attack?

16:35.159 --> 16:36.827
You're right. There's no indication

16:36.828 --> 16:38.245
of any terrorism.

16:38.246 --> 16:41.998
We believe these are simply isolated
and unrelated phenomena,

16:41.999 --> 16:44.751
and we expect things
to return to normal very soon.

16:44.752 --> 16:46.962
See? Already starting to play the shit down.

16:46.963 --> 16:48.755
The Center for Disease Control
believes this may be due

16:48.756 --> 16:50.632
to a previously unknown viral strain

16:50.633 --> 16:53.760
that leads to a kind of mass psychosis.

16:53.761 --> 16:55.804
Psychosis.
Who's gonna believe that?

16:55.805 --> 16:57.764
- Psychotics.
- The president continues

16:57.765 --> 16:59.599
to monitor the situation from his ranch,

16:59.600 --> 17:02.144
and he's asked the American people
to remain vigilant.

17:03.396 --> 17:05.188
Say who you are, Eliot.

17:05.189 --> 17:06.772
You just did. I'm Eliot.

17:06.773 --> 17:08.191
Tell us more.

17:08.192 --> 17:10.609
Eliot Stone, Harrisburg, PA,

17:10.611 --> 17:14.781
and I'm here with you fine people because--
I don't know-- I'd like to get home, too.

17:14.781 --> 17:17.992
It's on the way. I'm hoping you'll be
so kind as to drop me off.

17:17.993 --> 17:20.287
Seems like everybody
wants to get home.

17:20.288 --> 17:22.204
I know what you're trying to do, Jason.

17:22.205 --> 17:23.790
I get it.

17:23.790 --> 17:26.792
Gordo Thorson, Danville, Pennsylvania.

17:26.794 --> 17:28.795
Tracy Thurman.

17:28.796 --> 17:31.214
We're, uh-- We're together.

17:31.215 --> 17:32.549
Forever.

17:32.550 --> 17:35.385
Uh, yeah. We'll see.

17:35.386 --> 17:36.803
What's that?

17:36.804 --> 17:38.013
Oh, this is my camera.

17:40.892 --> 17:42.309
Smile.

17:42.310 --> 17:44.561
Thurman and Thorson.

17:44.562 --> 17:46.771
Give me a kiss.

17:46.772 --> 17:48.690
Oh, and I'm from San Anton'.

17:48.691 --> 17:50.817
That's in Texas.

17:50.818 --> 17:52.402
Don't mess with Texas.

17:52.403 --> 17:54.738
Holy shit. Look at this guy.

17:54.739 --> 17:59.739
Christ.

18:00.036 --> 18:03.371
He's gotta be doing, like, a buck-20.

18:03.372 --> 18:04.789
Professor.

18:04.790 --> 18:06.791
Ah, you've finally come to me.

18:06.792 --> 18:09.211
I was beginning to feel neglected.

18:09.212 --> 18:10.420
It's just that you're--

18:10.421 --> 18:13.798
So far away, I know. In steerage.

18:13.799 --> 18:18.799
Sitting on a toilet seat
with everyone's dirty laundry.

18:19.055 --> 18:22.140
Oh, Andrew Maxwell, emeritus.

18:22.141 --> 18:27.141
Nowhere to go, nothing to do,
and I'm not with anybody.

18:28.105 --> 18:31.066
That was Ravello just
popping along for the ride.

18:31.067 --> 18:33.818
I'm not with anyone, either.

18:33.819 --> 18:36.154
I'm just here all alone.

18:36.155 --> 18:38.365
Just me and St. Chris.

18:38.366 --> 18:41.826
I think we'll be calling
on old St. Chris before this night's over.

18:41.827 --> 18:43.828
Oh, my God! Look!

18:43.829 --> 18:45.580
We'll never get past that.

18:45.581 --> 18:47.832
Turn around. We should
go back to the dorms.

18:47.833 --> 18:48.833
Look!

18:48.834 --> 18:50.293
It's a cop. A state trooper.

18:50.294 --> 18:51.711
How do you know that?

18:51.712 --> 18:53.713
Oh, his hat. His hat--
His stupid-looking hat.

18:53.714 --> 18:54.714
He looks hurt.

18:54.715 --> 18:56.716
- He's all burned up.
- Yeah.

18:56.717 --> 18:59.094
He's not just burned,
he's fucking fried!

18:59.095 --> 19:00.679
He shouldn't even be walking.

19:00.680 --> 19:02.347
- Oh, my--
- He's dead.

19:02.348 --> 19:03.390
God damn it!

19:03.391 --> 19:05.558
I'm telling you, he can't
be anything else but dead.

19:05.559 --> 19:08.103
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus fucking Christ!

19:08.104 --> 19:09.604
I think he wants more

19:09.605 --> 19:11.106
than your license and registration!

19:14.694 --> 19:19.694
- Go! Go--
- My God!

19:22.994 --> 19:24.202
Fuck!

19:24.203 --> 19:25.829
Wait. Before you go, wait, wait.

19:25.830 --> 19:29.958
What's that? What's that?

19:52.982 --> 19:54.482
What are we doing?

19:54.483 --> 19:55.775
What time is it'?

19:55.776 --> 19:57.402
It's almost 3.

19:57.403 --> 19:59.237
I think we should pull over.

20:09.206 --> 20:11.750
How do you feel?

20:11.751 --> 20:15.837
Mary, how do you feel
about what just happened?

20:15.838 --> 20:18.214
How do you think I feel?

20:18.215 --> 20:20.008
They were already dead, okay?

20:20.009 --> 20:22.344
You didn't do anything wrong.

20:22.345 --> 20:24.804
Listen to me, unless
you're Jesus fucking Christ,

20:24.805 --> 20:26.806
you don't stand up
and walk around after you're dead!

20:26.807 --> 20:28.767
Would you shut up?

20:28.768 --> 20:30.810
We might've just killed
three people back there.

20:30.811 --> 20:33.104
All right? Three living,
breathing people like us.

20:33.105 --> 20:37.817
No, we didn't.

20:37.818 --> 20:39.652
I did.

20:39.653 --> 20:44.653
I did.

20:44.992 --> 20:49.992
Sorry.

20:55.711 --> 21:00.711
Shit!

21:04.845 --> 21:09.845
We've stopped somewhere off the road.

21:10.393 --> 21:13.144
God knows where.

21:13.145 --> 21:15.480
Aren't you gonna go say something?

21:15.481 --> 21:20.481
I don't know, man.
I'll just give her some time, you know?

21:21.320 --> 21:23.738
I'm running low.

21:23.739 --> 21:28.159
I'd like to make it to a state store
before they all shut their doors forever.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.495
God, there's a terrible thought.

21:30.496 --> 21:33.540
A world where a gentleman
can't buy a bottle of bourbon.

21:35.334 --> 21:37.001
God.

21:37.002 --> 21:39.003
Mary? Mary?

21:39.004 --> 21:41.798
No! What did she do?

21:41.799 --> 21:43.800
What the fuck did she do?

21:43.801 --> 21:45.093
Anyone know she had a gun?

21:45.094 --> 21:46.636
Why would she do this?

21:46.637 --> 21:50.807
Because of what happened?
Those people back there?

21:50.808 --> 21:52.684
This is our fault.

21:52.685 --> 21:55.270
For panicking, for turning this into--

21:55.271 --> 21:56.896
Into what?

21:56.897 --> 21:58.982
Into something it's not.

21:58.983 --> 22:00.525
Into something more than this is.

22:00.526 --> 22:01.901
This is all just bullshit!

22:01.902 --> 22:03.111
You keep calling this bullshit,

22:03.112 --> 22:05.488
someone else is gonna kill themselves!

22:05.489 --> 22:07.157
You heard the TV.
Mary heard the TV.

22:07.158 --> 22:08.616
We all should've just stayed at school

22:08.617 --> 22:10.201
instead of driving around
in the middle of nowhere

22:10.202 --> 22:12.162
knocking fucking people off
like bowling pins!

22:12.163 --> 22:17.163
- She's still alive.
- What?

22:17.918 --> 22:19.836
She's got a pulse.

22:19.837 --> 22:23.965
- Fuck. Pressure. Pressure.
- Mary.

22:23.966 --> 22:26.509
- Looks like everyone's left.
- Yeah, left in a hurry.

22:26.510 --> 22:28.595
It's a hospital.
Where else is she supposed to go?

22:28.596 --> 22:30.930
Just because we can't see anybody
doesn't mean no one's here.

22:30.931 --> 22:31.931
Maybe they're hiding.

22:31.932 --> 22:33.808
Yeah, maybe they're hiding
'cause they think we're dead.

22:33.809 --> 22:35.101
Hello! We're not dead!

22:35.102 --> 22:37.896
Cut it out, Tony.

22:37.897 --> 22:39.898
Wait, wait, wait. Where are we going?

22:39.899 --> 22:43.401
You guys look for a doctor.
We're gonna find the E.R.

22:43.402 --> 22:46.779
Hello? Is anyone here?

22:46.780 --> 22:48.948
Wait, I think I hear somebody.

22:51.035 --> 22:56.035
It's down here. Come on.

23:02.087 --> 23:07.087
It's just the radio.

23:19.438 --> 23:22.440
We just saw some in the location...

23:22.441 --> 23:23.775
Hello?

23:23.776 --> 23:25.443
- Is anyone--
- Shh. Shh.

23:25.444 --> 23:26.444
What?

23:26.445 --> 23:28.071
...coming away from the building,
what's wrong?

23:28.072 --> 23:29.614
He wants to stay here

23:29.615 --> 23:31.449
'cause we can't move.

23:31.450 --> 23:33.117
Stand by. Stand by.

23:39.875 --> 23:42.460
It's complete chaos.

23:43.837 --> 23:45.755
It's complete fucking chaos.

23:45.756 --> 23:48.007
- We got him.
- I know I got him!

23:56.267 --> 23:57.767
Gotta go for the head.

23:57.768 --> 23:59.477
No, you gotta go for the head.

23:59.478 --> 24:03.481
Tell everyone out there
they've gotta get them in the head.

24:03.482 --> 24:07.485
This isn't some sort of mistake?

24:07.486 --> 24:12.448
This is a hospital. There's nobody here.

24:16.495 --> 24:20.290
What if it is for real?

24:20.291 --> 24:23.501
What about Mary?

24:23.502 --> 24:25.336
What if...

24:25.337 --> 24:26.879
she dies?

24:26.880 --> 24:28.506
We're not doing any good
just standing around here.

24:28.507 --> 24:30.300
Fuck. Losing juice.

24:30.301 --> 24:35.301
- Let's see if we can find some help.

24:36.724 --> 24:39.434
- There's somebody.
- Excuse me.

24:39.435 --> 24:41.227
Excuse me.

24:41.228 --> 24:42.353
We have an emergency.

24:42.354 --> 24:44.522
Our friend is hurt, and we need help.

24:45.524 --> 24:46.608
Oh, my God.

24:46.609 --> 24:48.026
What's wrong with him?

24:48.027 --> 24:49.569
He's dead,
that's what's wrong with him.

24:49.570 --> 24:50.653
Use the gun.

24:50.654 --> 24:51.821
- Oh, God.
- Hurry, use the gun.

24:51.822 --> 24:56.034
What if there's others?

24:56.035 --> 24:57.827
- Guys?
- Try the head.

24:57.828 --> 24:59.454
- Try the head.
- Yeah, shoot him in the head.

24:59.455 --> 25:02.874
Shoot him in the head!

25:02.875 --> 25:04.834
Fuck. Battery's almost dead.

25:04.835 --> 25:06.836
- Yeah, that's not all.
- What do you mean?

25:06.837 --> 25:07.879
What is going on?

25:07.880 --> 25:09.255
Jesus. A nurse.

25:09.256 --> 25:12.216
Dead doctor, dead nurse.
Makes sense, doesn't it?

25:13.302 --> 25:15.595
Let's fucking hurry up. Gordo!

25:15.596 --> 25:16.804
It's jammed.

25:16.805 --> 25:18.473
- Okay, I'm gonna try something.
- Try what?

25:18.474 --> 25:20.141
Get her attention.
Just try and get her attention.

25:20.142 --> 25:21.809
- Come over here.
- Hey!

25:21.810 --> 25:23.186
- Come after me.
- Be careful, Debra.

25:23.187 --> 25:24.270
Careful.

25:24.271 --> 25:25.647
Shock assigned.

25:25.648 --> 25:29.108
Jesus H...

25:29.109 --> 25:31.819
Christ.

25:31.820 --> 25:34.155
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Those are hot.

25:34.156 --> 25:36.824
Put them back where you found them.

25:38.994 --> 25:41.162
We got to get her a doctor.

25:41.163 --> 25:44.207
Yeah, a live one.

25:45.626 --> 25:50.626
I got it.

25:53.133 --> 25:54.133
Let's go.

25:57.388 --> 25:58.846
No, leave her here with me.

25:58.847 --> 26:00.098
What, you're not coming with us?

26:00.099 --> 26:01.516
I can't. I gotta plug in.

26:01.517 --> 26:03.059
Leave it. Let it charge.

26:03.060 --> 26:05.436
I can%.I can%leave
without the camera.

26:05.437 --> 26:06.896
The camera's the whole thing.

26:06.897 --> 26:08.272
Getting help is the whole thing.

26:18.033 --> 26:20.243
I should be with them.

26:20.244 --> 26:23.538
Maybe I could help.

26:23.539 --> 26:24.622
I can't.

26:24.623 --> 26:26.332
I can't...

26:26.333 --> 26:27.959
because...

26:27.960 --> 26:32.960
I'm fucking plugged in.

26:34.049 --> 26:36.551
Some shit, huh?

26:36.552 --> 26:41.552
Left alone with these fucking dead guys.

26:41.682 --> 26:43.558
I'm sorry, Mary.

26:43.559 --> 26:46.853
If anything Tony said or I said or did

26:46.854 --> 26:50.356
made you--

26:50.357 --> 26:52.900
People you killed were dead.

26:52.901 --> 26:55.570
These people are dead.

26:55.571 --> 26:58.865
At least they look dead.

26:58.866 --> 26:59.907
I don't know.

26:59.908 --> 27:03.828
The way things are...

27:03.829 --> 27:08.666
who the fuck knows?

27:08.667 --> 27:11.669
Mary.

27:11.670 --> 27:14.589
Mary?

27:17.593 --> 27:20.344
Shit.

27:21.597 --> 27:24.474
Guys?

27:25.601 --> 27:28.144
Guys, what's happening?

27:28.145 --> 27:29.645
Fuck. God damn it.

27:32.065 --> 27:35.443
Hello?

27:35.444 --> 27:38.738
Hello.

27:38.739 --> 27:43.739
I found this in one of the other rooms.

27:45.621 --> 27:47.079
Tell us your name.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.289
Uh...

27:48.290 --> 27:49.624
Say it.

27:49.625 --> 27:50.917
- Deb, come on.
- Say it.

27:50.918 --> 27:52.001
Give me a break.

27:52.002 --> 27:53.002
Jay-- Jason.

27:53.003 --> 27:55.296
- Jason Creed.
- You see how it feels

27:55.297 --> 27:57.757
to have a camera shoved in your face?

27:57.758 --> 28:00.718
To have to answer stupid questions
when people are dying all around you?

28:00.719 --> 28:02.094
You see how it feels?

28:02.095 --> 28:06.766
Deb, just put the thing down
and tell me what happened.

28:06.767 --> 28:09.101
Well, you missed it.

28:09.102 --> 28:14.102
If it didn't happen on camera,
it's like it didn't happen, right?

28:15.359 --> 28:16.651
There was a--

28:16.652 --> 28:20.112
There was a patient
in one of the other rooms.

28:20.113 --> 28:23.074
He looked nice, you know?

28:23.075 --> 28:25.034
Not dead.

28:25.035 --> 28:29.247
But he was.

28:29.248 --> 28:33.501
He was almost on top of me
before I saw him.

28:33.502 --> 28:38.502
It was Gordo who shot him.

28:38.507 --> 28:40.508
Jesus, did you--

28:40.509 --> 28:43.845
- I mean, did he--
- Hurt me?

28:43.846 --> 28:45.221
No.

28:45.222 --> 28:47.682
Well, who was screaming?

28:47.683 --> 28:49.016
Me.

28:49.017 --> 28:50.518
You want me to show you how?

28:50.519 --> 28:52.478
For the camera?

28:52.479 --> 28:54.522
For history?

28:54.523 --> 28:56.482
Aah!

28:56.483 --> 28:57.483
That's enough, Deb. I--

28:57.484 --> 28:59.819
Aah!

28:59.820 --> 29:04.820
Oh, God.

29:10.455 --> 29:15.126
I just shot another man.

29:15.127 --> 29:20.127
I've killed three men and a woman
in the last half hour.

29:20.340 --> 29:23.593
It came easily, too, didn't it?

29:23.594 --> 29:25.845
I remember the war.

29:25.846 --> 29:27.972
In wartime,

29:27.973 --> 29:30.558
killing comes easily,

29:30.559 --> 29:34.770
especially when you don't
have to do any of it.

29:34.771 --> 29:37.356
There will always be people like you,

29:37.357 --> 29:41.527
wanting to document,
wanting to record some sort of diary.

29:41.528 --> 29:43.863
Me? You're the one
who put the camera in my hands.

29:43.864 --> 29:45.907
You're the one
who made me want to do this.

29:45.908 --> 29:47.825
Not this. This is a diary of cruelty.

29:47.826 --> 29:49.994
And in wartime,
when the enemy can be marked

29:49.995 --> 29:52.830
as this son of a bitch
or that son of a bitch,

29:52.831 --> 29:55.166
then cruelty...

29:55.167 --> 29:57.084
becomes justified.

29:57.085 --> 29:59.754
Oh, my God.

29:59.755 --> 30:01.964
Oh, my God. Look at Mary.

30:01.965 --> 30:04.383
She's-- She's dead.

30:04.384 --> 30:07.470
She's turning.

30:08.889 --> 30:10.806
This is, like, too much.

30:10.807 --> 30:12.183
Too much.

30:13.518 --> 30:16.854
Guys, I don't know.

30:16.855 --> 30:18.522
Give it to me.

30:18.523 --> 30:23.523
You can't do this. Give me the gun.

30:32.079 --> 30:33.537
Oh, man.

30:33.538 --> 30:35.706
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

30:35.707 --> 30:39.543
You're stuttering, Mr. Creed.

30:39.544 --> 30:42.046
Don't try to speak, just shoot.

30:42.047 --> 30:45.633
Shoot your picture. Shoot for as long
as your hard drive holds out.

30:45.634 --> 30:49.428
As long as you have power.

30:49.429 --> 30:52.682
Take this.

30:52.683 --> 30:57.683
It's too easy to use.

30:59.856 --> 31:04.735
Let's get out of here.

31:04.736 --> 31:06.946
it's interesting how quickly we find out

31:06.947 --> 31:08.447
what we're capable of becoming.

31:11.827 --> 31:15.037
Up until that night,
we had lived predictable lives.

31:15.038 --> 31:16.330
Now...

31:16.331 --> 31:20.251
we would never be able to predict
what might happen next.

31:20.252 --> 31:22.712
God had changed the rules on us.

31:22.713 --> 31:27.713
And surprisingly, we were playing along.

31:31.555 --> 31:32.596
What the--

31:32.597 --> 31:35.141
Jesus, Gordo! Look out!

31:35.142 --> 31:36.600
Aah!

31:36.601 --> 31:41.601
What? What happened?

31:46.445 --> 31:48.112
You think they're not dead?
Huh, Tony?

31:48.113 --> 31:49.238
Tell me this guy isn't dead...

31:50.866 --> 31:53.576
...after I jam him
through the heart with a fucking I.V. pole!

31:53.577 --> 31:56.579
Jesus! Oh, regular fucking die, huh?

31:56.580 --> 32:01.580
You think he's not dead?

32:01.626 --> 32:03.085
DO you get it, Tony?

32:03.086 --> 32:08.086
Do you finally fucking understand?

32:14.639 --> 32:16.640
- What happened?
- It hurts.

32:16.641 --> 32:20.770
Bite.

32:20.771 --> 32:25.771
It hurts.

32:26.902 --> 32:28.903
Here, take this. It's too easy to use.

32:28.904 --> 32:31.197
Come on, Deb,
you used to shoot better than me.

32:31.198 --> 32:32.323
Yeah, that's why I stopped.

32:32.324 --> 32:37.324
I don't want to become you.

32:38.330 --> 32:39.789
There are currently more

32:39.790 --> 32:42.833
than 200 million video cameras
in people's hands worldwide.

32:42.834 --> 32:44.418
Blogs, video windows,
and streaming videos...

32:44.419 --> 32:46.087
Now, there's too much information.

32:46.088 --> 32:47.797
...are indicating more
than 40 million visitors a month.

32:47.798 --> 32:49.256
Where do you go to find the truth?

32:49.257 --> 32:51.258
Is it your job as a journalist
to just keep shooting?

32:51.259 --> 32:53.135
Those of us in the media
put ourselves ahead

32:53.136 --> 32:54.512
of what we see happening...

32:54.513 --> 32:55.805
There were no weapons
of mass destruction.

32:57.432 --> 32:58.808
Millions of them are out there,

32:58.809 --> 33:02.686
driven, compelled to broadcast
their particular views of things.

33:02.687 --> 33:05.397
Compelled, like the man said,

33:05.398 --> 33:07.441
Jason was compelled.

33:07.442 --> 33:09.735
I had never seen him like that before.

33:09.736 --> 33:10.945
What is it?

33:10.946 --> 33:14.615
What gets into our heads
when we see something horrible?

33:14.616 --> 33:17.618
A horrible accident on the highway.

33:17.619 --> 33:20.329
Something keeps us from just driving on.

33:20.330 --> 33:22.540
Something holds us.

33:22.541 --> 33:24.625
But we don't stop to help.

33:24.626 --> 33:25.960
We stop to look.

33:35.303 --> 33:40.303
It's our first morning
since we hit the road.

33:40.642 --> 33:43.060
We're here to say good-bye.

33:43.061 --> 33:47.314
I don't understand why he died.

33:47.315 --> 33:51.652
It was just a bite.
How could someone die from one little bite?

33:51.653 --> 33:54.155
Maybe it's some kind
of poison or something.

33:54.156 --> 33:56.031
Maybe it is a virus.

33:56.032 --> 33:57.825
Anyone gets bit
comes back as one of them.

33:57.826 --> 34:00.828
No, anyone who dies comes
back as one of them.

34:00.829 --> 34:02.872
Thurman and Thorson.

34:05.333 --> 34:06.917
No. No.

34:06.918 --> 34:08.460
No.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.462
We gotta bury him, right?

34:10.463 --> 34:14.466
How would you feel waking up
under 6 feet of dirt?

34:14.467 --> 34:16.177
Can't we just wait?

34:16.178 --> 34:18.262
Can't we just at least wait and see?

34:18.263 --> 34:20.472
Maybe it won't happen to him.

34:20.473 --> 34:21.724
Please?

34:21.725 --> 34:26.725
Can we just wait?

34:31.067 --> 34:36.067
Due to unusual volume,
your call did not go through as dialed.

34:37.032 --> 34:38.866
Hey, you guys, we gotta get going.

34:38.867 --> 34:40.618
- I gotta get--
- Get home?

34:40.619 --> 34:42.119
Yeah.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.038
Although after this,
who knows what we're gonna find?

34:44.039 --> 34:45.164
Your folks will be fine, Deb.

34:45.165 --> 34:46.498
They're smart people, like you.

34:46.498 --> 34:48.333
Oh, shit. Look.

35:01.932 --> 35:06.932
Poor Gordo. He just ï¬‚unked out.

35:12.484 --> 35:14.443
...and the rock will not hide you.

35:14.444 --> 35:16.403
The dead tree will give no shelter.

35:16.404 --> 35:17.988
Can you say amen?

35:17.989 --> 35:20.074
These are the end of times.

35:20.075 --> 35:22.534
And for the sinner
there will be no end,

35:22.535 --> 35:24.870
only the death that will not die,

35:24.871 --> 35:27.748
and the hunger that will not be satisfied.

35:27.749 --> 35:31.085
Get on your knees.
Get on your knees.

35:31.086 --> 35:33.921
Get on your fucking knees.

35:33.922 --> 35:34.922
Here is

35:34.923 --> 35:37.091
a Channel 11 News update.

35:37.092 --> 35:38.759
It wasn't until we uploaded this footage

35:38.760 --> 35:41.303
that we saw how bad everything was.

35:46.518 --> 35:48.727
Don't try to come into any major city,

35:48.728 --> 35:50.562
where there are reports of violence,

35:50.563 --> 35:52.398
looting, killing.

35:52.399 --> 35:54.191
Small towns tonight are like ghost towns,

35:54.192 --> 35:56.235
as most people have fled for their lives,

35:56.236 --> 35:57.361
believing that this might be the beginning

35:57.362 --> 35:59.488
of some sort of Armageddon.

36:02.325 --> 36:03.659
Using country roads,

36:03.660 --> 36:06.495
we hadn't run into any riots or looting.

36:06.496 --> 36:08.706
But we were about to run
into something else.

36:08.707 --> 36:10.416
Turn, old piece of shit.

36:10.417 --> 36:12.918
Oh, my God. I knew
it was gonna break down.

36:12.919 --> 36:14.336
It's all right.

36:14.337 --> 36:16.338
It's all right. We could fix it.

36:16.339 --> 36:18.048
God couldn't fix it.

36:18.049 --> 36:19.425
...lock yourself inside.

36:19.426 --> 36:21.135
Don't trust anyone,
not even those you love.

36:23.346 --> 36:25.514
I think it's the fuel line.

36:25.515 --> 36:27.766
If that's what it is, I can fix it.

36:27.767 --> 36:30.352
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

36:30.353 --> 36:31.854
I know what I'm doing.

36:31.855 --> 36:33.605
Daddy used to pit crew for Dale.

36:33.606 --> 36:35.524
- Earnhardt?
- Gerber.

36:35.525 --> 36:37.401
Who the hell's Dale Gerber?

36:37.402 --> 36:39.445
We can't stay out here, guys.

36:39.446 --> 36:42.364
We gotta get the Winnie
inside that barn.

36:42.365 --> 36:43.991
I'm gonna go see if the owner is home.

36:43.992 --> 36:45.909
You might not want to do that.
There might be--

36:47.370 --> 36:48.954
Oh, shit.

36:48.955 --> 36:50.873
Whoa, whoa, stop.
I don't think he's dead.

36:50.874 --> 36:52.416
I-- He might not be dead.

36:52.417 --> 36:54.251
Who are 'ou?

36:54.252 --> 36:59.252
Who are you?
He's asking us who we are.

37:04.763 --> 37:06.180
Great.

37:08.433 --> 37:10.684
Our car broke down. We need help.

37:10.685 --> 37:15.685
Oh.

37:18.693 --> 37:20.944
No, we don't need a car.
We just need to fix ours.

37:20.945 --> 37:25.945
- We need to use your barn.
- Oh.

37:28.119 --> 37:32.039
- "Hurry." Why?
- What?

37:32.040 --> 37:33.415
- Oh, shit!
- Lord!

37:33.416 --> 37:34.666
They must have been following us.

37:34.667 --> 37:35.834
Oh, my Lord.

37:35.835 --> 37:37.461
Tony, how many bullets you got left?

37:37.462 --> 37:41.006
Where did he go?

37:42.092 --> 37:43.842
Jesus Christ.

37:45.387 --> 37:50.387
I thought the Amish were friendly folk.

37:52.268 --> 37:57.022
Yep. Gas line's leaking.

37:57.023 --> 37:59.691
I'm gonna cut the line below the tear

37:59.692 --> 38:01.693
and get her hooked back up to the post.

38:01.694 --> 38:05.155
Thanks.

38:07.700 --> 38:09.076
What is that?

38:09.077 --> 38:10.994
Guys, what's all that screaming?

38:10.995 --> 38:12.746
Birthday party.

38:12.747 --> 38:14.540
Where did you find this?

38:14.541 --> 38:16.542
It was on the camera
that Deb found in the hospital.

38:16.543 --> 38:21.543
Surprise!

38:22.632 --> 38:26.718
Bupkus is here.

38:26.719 --> 38:28.387
Don't be afraid, Gina.

38:28.388 --> 38:29.930
I think she's afraid of his nose.

38:29.931 --> 38:31.014
That's the guy.

38:31.015 --> 38:32.516
The one in the orange shirt.

38:32.517 --> 38:33.725
That's the guy from the hospital.

38:33.726 --> 38:34.935
The one I thought looked nice.

38:34.936 --> 38:37.104
Honk-honk.

38:37.105 --> 38:38.605
The one Gordo shot.

38:38.606 --> 38:42.359
Aah!

38:43.736 --> 38:45.195
What's that?

38:45.196 --> 38:48.115
Guys, what's that?

38:48.116 --> 38:50.492
They're in the back, at the back wall.

38:50.493 --> 38:55.122
It sounds as if they're out front as well.

38:55.123 --> 38:57.708
What the hell is going on out there?

38:57.709 --> 39:02.709
Jesus Christ.

39:05.717 --> 39:10.717
God, there's a party out there.

39:14.601 --> 39:18.312
Oh! Shit!

39:18.313 --> 39:20.397
There seems to be some sort of trap door.

39:20.398 --> 39:21.482
I'm hurrying.

39:21.483 --> 39:23.317
Can we get our asses out of here?

39:23.318 --> 39:24.610
Not to apply unnecessary pressure,

39:24.611 --> 39:28.405
but we are all relying on you, darling.

39:28.406 --> 39:33.406
Oh, my God. The door's open.

39:37.707 --> 39:40.959
Shh. I hear something.

39:52.972 --> 39:54.890
Maybe one of them got in already.

39:54.891 --> 39:58.018
Maybe more than one.

40:04.609 --> 40:06.443
Guys, what is happening?

40:06.444 --> 40:08.445
We're all right!

40:08.446 --> 40:13.446
We're all right.

40:19.958 --> 40:21.917
- Almost there.
- I certainly hope so, darling,

40:21.918 --> 40:24.211
as much as I love
spending time with you.

40:24.212 --> 40:29.212
Aah!

40:36.474 --> 40:39.476
Tracy, I love you.

40:39.477 --> 40:41.270
All right! Open the door!

40:41.271 --> 40:45.607
Open up, Tony. Let's 99-

40:45.608 --> 40:48.569
You see how many there are?
Look how many.

40:48.570 --> 40:49.820
Come on.

40:49.821 --> 40:51.196
Come on, come on.

40:51.197 --> 40:54.908
Gentlemen, hurry.

40:54.909 --> 40:59.909
Aah!

41:03.209 --> 41:04.626
Oh, my God.

41:04.627 --> 41:06.336
- Oh, my God.
- It's all right. We're all right.

41:06.337 --> 41:07.963
There's nothing
we can do for him. Let's go.

41:07.964 --> 41:12.964
- But--
- They're gonna be all over us. Let's go!

41:25.356 --> 41:26.898
It's estimated that

41:26.899 --> 41:28.483
if something isn't done
to stop the slaughter

41:28.484 --> 41:31.903
within three more days,
our death rate will quadruple.

41:31.904 --> 41:34.239
Within 10 days,
it will have risen by 100%.

41:34.240 --> 41:35.699
Before there were--

41:35.700 --> 41:38.493
I don't know how many people
died every minute--

41:38.494 --> 41:41.705
8, 10, 20?

41:41.706 --> 41:44.708
Now there were five times
as many, ten times,

41:44.709 --> 41:47.919
a hundred times as many.

41:47.920 --> 41:51.715
Dead but walking.

41:51.716 --> 41:54.259
There weren't enough bullets
to stop them all.

41:54.260 --> 41:55.636
They are monsters.

41:55.637 --> 41:57.721
monsters who prey
on the flesh of the living.

41:57.722 --> 41:59.473
We needed supplies.

41:59.474 --> 42:00.766
Gas.

42:00.767 --> 42:03.393
Without gas,
we weren't going anywhere.

42:03.394 --> 42:04.728
There might be more of them around.

42:04.729 --> 42:05.854
Think we can make it?

42:05.855 --> 42:06.855
We've gotta try.

42:06.856 --> 42:08.940
Get in, fill up, get out fast.

42:08.941 --> 42:11.818
Yeah, but what if--

42:11.819 --> 42:14.071
- Put the gun down.
- Who the hell are you?

42:14.072 --> 42:16.990
Don't matter who I am.
All that matters is what I got.

42:16.991 --> 42:19.785
What he's got's
better than yours, Tony. Way better!

42:19.786 --> 42:22.829
Damn right. There here
is an M-16 semi-auto

42:22.830 --> 42:24.748
with the safety turned off.

42:24.749 --> 42:26.166
And I'm just trying to decide,

42:26.167 --> 42:27.751
do I pump two bullets into your brain

42:27.752 --> 42:30.045
or just one?

42:30.046 --> 42:34.675
No, we're cool.

42:34.676 --> 42:36.760
Good choice.

42:36.761 --> 42:38.804
Now who the hell are y'all?

42:38.805 --> 42:40.222
Some kind of newspeople?

42:40.223 --> 42:42.140
No. Students. University of Pittsburgh.

42:42.141 --> 42:46.144
Damn rowdies from town gone crazy.

42:46.145 --> 42:48.146
- Come on.
- Come on? Where?

42:48.147 --> 42:50.774
Anyplace is better than this, ain't it?

42:50.775 --> 42:55.775
Come on, before we get
our asses shot off!

42:56.781 --> 42:59.116
...always arguing about immigration.

42:59.117 --> 43:00.659
Let them in, keep them out,

43:00.660 --> 43:02.536
lock your door
and throw away the key.

43:02.537 --> 43:03.870
We've come here
concerned about people

43:03.871 --> 43:06.081
crossing the border into our country.

43:06.082 --> 43:07.791
But that's not the problem anymore.

43:07.792 --> 43:10.001
The problem
is all those creatures crossing the border

43:10.002 --> 43:15.002
between life and death.

43:16.259 --> 43:20.929
Ready for some boxes over there, man?

43:20.930 --> 43:23.223
What the hell's with
that camera anyway?

43:23.224 --> 43:25.225
Uh, home movies.

43:25.226 --> 43:30.226
Who's gonna be left to watch?

43:35.027 --> 43:36.862
So what's up with y'all?

43:36.863 --> 43:39.573
What the hell you doing in my town?

43:39.574 --> 43:42.743
We're trying to get to Scranton,
but we need fuel.

43:42.744 --> 43:44.703
We were using those pumps
back there at the gas station.

43:44.704 --> 43:46.288
Them pumps is dry.

43:46.289 --> 43:48.206
We siphoned off all the gas.

43:48.207 --> 43:50.709
- Can we buy some of what you took?
- Buy?

43:50.710 --> 43:53.712
Girl, if this keeps up,
money ain't gonna be worth nothing.

43:53.713 --> 43:56.006
Talking about gas, yeah,
I'll let you have some.

43:56.007 --> 43:57.924
Enough to get you where you're going.

43:57.925 --> 44:01.303
What's with you all?
How come you stuck around?

44:01.304 --> 44:03.597
'Cause we got the power.

44:03.598 --> 44:07.642
For the first time in our lives,
we got the power

44:07.643 --> 44:09.853
'cause everybody else left.

44:09.854 --> 44:12.189
All the folks without suntans.

44:12.190 --> 44:15.734
They'll be back, right?
The Army? National Guard?

44:15.735 --> 44:18.028
Somebody's gotta put
all this shit back together.

44:18.029 --> 44:19.946
The National Guard.

44:19.947 --> 44:21.907
Kid, I'm in the National Guard.

44:21.908 --> 44:24.868
Anyway, no one's
coming to put nothing together.

44:24.869 --> 44:26.870
That's why we got all this shit.

44:26.871 --> 44:28.789
Anything worth anything under one roof.

44:28.790 --> 44:30.248
- It's called looting.
- No, ma'am.

44:30.249 --> 44:33.794
It's called doing what you gotta do.

44:33.795 --> 44:35.962
Can I get online?

44:35.963 --> 44:38.757
Back there.

44:38.758 --> 44:41.635
Uh, excuse me.

44:41.636 --> 44:44.179
It's all right. Let him through.

44:44.180 --> 44:46.973
Let him through.

44:46.974 --> 44:48.350
In fact,

44:48.351 --> 44:51.853
law enforcement authorities
and a reporter was on the scene.

44:51.854 --> 44:54.773
Here's Homestead Chief
of Police Arthur Katz.

44:54.774 --> 44:57.776
These attacks was carried out
by a bunch of illegal immigrants

44:57.777 --> 45:01.655
was mistakenly pronounced dead
before the attacks took place.

45:01.656 --> 45:04.533
The only time they was dead
was when my guys shot 'em.

45:04.534 --> 45:07.285
They changed it. They recut it.

45:07.286 --> 45:09.871
The media were lying to us,

45:09.872 --> 45:12.040
or the government was lying to them.

45:12.041 --> 45:15.669
They were trying to make it seem
like everything was gonna be all right.

45:15.670 --> 45:16.711
What are you doing?

45:16.712 --> 45:19.047
I just want to shoot us
while we're editing.

45:19.048 --> 45:21.216
- Oh.
- I want to cover everything.

45:21.217 --> 45:22.759
Now I can understand

45:22.760 --> 45:25.679
why Jason was so anxious
to upload his own footage.

45:25.680 --> 45:29.057
- Okay.
- At the time, I didn't get it.

45:29.058 --> 45:33.478
Right there, we'll cut
to the angle from your camera.

45:33.479 --> 45:38.479
- Look!
- Perfect.

45:42.280 --> 45:44.823
- Put the gun down.
- Who the hell are you?

45:44.824 --> 45:47.993
Don't matter who I am.
All that matters is what I got.

45:47.994 --> 45:49.828
And after that, we drove here?

45:49.829 --> 45:51.830
Yeah. It sure would be nice

45:51.831 --> 45:53.164
to have the surveillance camera angle

45:53.165 --> 45:54.416
from when we drove in.

45:54.417 --> 45:57.419
Figured as much. Got it.

45:57.420 --> 45:59.504
They're recording all the security cameras.

45:59.505 --> 46:02.299
It's like a 7-Eleven in here.
I got it all cued up for you.

46:02.300 --> 46:04.843
- Oh, you're fucking brilliant, man.
- Why, thank you.

46:04.844 --> 46:06.511
What'd you do, get it off the recorders?

46:06.512 --> 46:08.179
It's a wireless system.
Pretty sophisticated.

46:08.180 --> 46:10.849
So sophisticated that I was
easily able to rip it off

46:10.850 --> 46:12.142
right out of the air.

46:12.143 --> 46:14.394
Beautiful. This is excellent.

46:14.395 --> 46:16.730
What the hell are you guys doing?

46:16.731 --> 46:19.482
Uh, editing.

46:19.483 --> 46:21.735
Editing what?

46:21.736 --> 46:23.653
The stuff we shot.

46:23.654 --> 46:25.739
When you said you want to get online,

46:25.740 --> 46:28.742
I thought you wanted to, like,
get in touch with your dad or something?

46:28.743 --> 46:30.952
No, I just wanted to upload our shit.

46:30.953 --> 46:35.457
Look, 72,000 hits...

46:35.458 --> 46:39.377
in eight minutes.

46:39.378 --> 46:41.421
Hey, Eliot, can we have a moment, please?

46:41.422 --> 46:46.422
Yeah.

46:46.928 --> 46:50.096
- ls his camera on?
- Yeah.

46:50.097 --> 46:51.640
If we're gonna have a conversation,

46:51.641 --> 46:53.850
I'm sure you'd like to have it on tape.

46:53.851 --> 46:55.226
If it's not on camera,

46:55.227 --> 46:57.938
it's like it never happened, right?

46:57.939 --> 46:59.481
Okay, Jay, listen to me.

46:59.482 --> 47:02.317
I'm trying to get home
to my family, okay?

47:02.318 --> 47:04.235
Everyone out there is trying to get home.

47:04.236 --> 47:06.696
And you're in here dicking around
on your computer.

47:06.697 --> 47:09.032
It was a pretty one-sided conversation.

47:09.033 --> 47:11.034
72,000 hits.

47:11.035 --> 47:12.869
-- They're coming in from all over the world.

47:12.870 --> 47:15.246
They're not getting the truth
from anybody else.

47:15.247 --> 47:17.999
All that shit on the news
is a pack of lies.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.876
72,000 hits in eight minutes.

47:19.877 --> 47:21.878
- That's unbelievable.
- Congratulations. You're famous.

47:21.879 --> 47:23.588
-- That's not what it's about.

47:23.589 --> 47:24.881
-- Would you rather have people

47:24.882 --> 47:26.299
not knowing what's going on in the world?

47:26.300 --> 47:27.884
-- We might even be able to save

47:27.885 --> 47:29.427
somebody's fucking life here.

47:29.428 --> 47:31.721
-- 72,000 hits.

47:31.722 --> 47:33.890
In another hour,
it'll probably be a million.

47:33.891 --> 47:35.100
By tomorrow, who knows?

47:35.101 --> 47:36.893
-- All over the world,

47:36.894 --> 47:38.311
people learning how to survive

47:38.312 --> 47:40.730
by seeing how we manage to survive.

47:42.900 --> 47:47.900
You always know
how to make a good argument, Jay.

47:50.950 --> 47:52.158
Oh, my God.

47:52.159 --> 47:53.910
Text message from my little brother.

47:53.911 --> 47:56.621
Whoa. What's it say?

47:56.622 --> 47:58.832
All this time I've
been imagining them dead in our house,

47:58.833 --> 48:00.291
and they're not even home.

48:00.292 --> 48:02.252
They went camping four days ago.

48:02.253 --> 48:03.628
"Driving home. All okay.

48:03.629 --> 48:05.380
Hope you are, too."

48:05.381 --> 48:07.215
Sent last night. "Driving home."

48:07.216 --> 48:09.009
That means they're probably
gonna beat us there.

48:09.010 --> 48:10.176
I told you they were safe.

48:10.177 --> 48:11.886
They're on the road, same as us.

48:11.887 --> 48:14.681
They're not safe, but they're still alive.

48:14.682 --> 48:17.183
Pack your shit.
I'm gonna go check on that gas.

48:29.196 --> 48:32.073
Yo, dude.

48:32.074 --> 48:33.867
Where are you, man?

48:33.868 --> 48:35.994
Ridley, yo back at you.

48:35.995 --> 48:38.038
We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere out here.

48:38.039 --> 48:39.080
How's Deb?

48:39.081 --> 48:41.124
Uh, she's okay.

48:41.125 --> 48:43.209
You know, coping.

48:43.210 --> 48:47.797
Look, if you need anything,
like a place to chill, whatever,

48:47.798 --> 48:51.217
get your ass down here, man!

48:51.218 --> 48:53.261
We're having a blast!

48:53.262 --> 48:56.681
Hi, Jay! Love you!

48:59.977 --> 49:01.102
What's up?

49:01.103 --> 49:03.563
I don't know.

49:03.564 --> 49:07.275
Something's going on.

49:07.276 --> 49:08.902
One of my men had a bad heart.

49:08.903 --> 49:10.236
He died.

49:10.237 --> 49:14.407
Thing is we don't know where he went.

49:14.408 --> 49:15.992
This shit ain't freaking you out, though.

49:15.993 --> 49:20.993
We talking about this nigga Charlie, man.

49:36.305 --> 49:41.305
Shit.

49:50.069 --> 49:52.153
Maybe we should get inside
and lock the door.

49:52.154 --> 49:53.321
I'm gonna go get Jason.

49:53.322 --> 49:56.282
Stay. I'll go.

49:56.283 --> 49:59.035
Wait, wait.
That thing could be inside there.

49:59.036 --> 50:04.036
That thing can be anywhere.

50:14.009 --> 50:15.260
Fuck.

50:15.261 --> 50:16.511
$100,000 education,

50:16.512 --> 50:21.512
I can't find my way
out of a fucking warehouse.

50:27.523 --> 50:32.523
Exit. Exit.

50:34.488 --> 50:36.072
What the fuck was that?

50:37.575 --> 50:38.700
Oh, fuck.

50:41.495 --> 50:43.538
Fuck.

50:43.539 --> 50:48.539
Fuck.

50:50.546 --> 50:52.130
- Where the hell have you been?
- What?

50:52.131 --> 50:54.048
There's a dead guy
walking around. Let's go.

50:54.049 --> 50:56.092
Wait. Say that again. I didn't get it.

50:56.093 --> 51:00.013
There is a dead guy
walking around. Now let's go.

51:00.014 --> 51:03.558
...were killing and eating their victims,

51:03.559 --> 51:06.895
prompting authorities to examine
the bodies of some of the victims.

51:06.896 --> 51:10.899
Medical authorities in Cumberland
have concluded that in all cases

51:10.900 --> 51:15.570
the killers are eating flesh
of the people they murder.

51:15.571 --> 51:17.280
Repeating this latest bulletin

51:17.281 --> 51:19.741
just received moments ago
from Cumberland, Maryland--

51:19.742 --> 51:21.576
- Civil Defense authorities--
- It's all clear.

51:21.577 --> 51:23.369
...that murders victims,

51:23.370 --> 51:25.580
new evidence of having
been partially devoured

51:25.581 --> 51:26.915
by their murderers.

51:26.916 --> 51:28.041
Medical examination--

51:28.042 --> 51:31.044
Turn that TV off!

51:33.881 --> 51:36.049
All right.

51:36.050 --> 51:40.178
Everyone with a heartbeat,
freeze and shut up.

51:57.738 --> 52:01.282
Son of a bitch. Where are we?

52:01.283 --> 52:03.576
Fuck.

52:03.577 --> 52:06.579
Shh. Shh.

52:08.082 --> 52:09.165
Fuck me!

52:10.626 --> 52:15.626
Okay. All right. We're good.

52:16.548 --> 52:20.635
That-- That's the door. Let's go.

52:20.636 --> 52:22.345
- Whoa! It's us!
- It's cool.

52:22.346 --> 52:24.681
- Okay?
- Shut the fuck up!

52:24.682 --> 52:26.766
I see him! I see him over there, yo!

52:28.644 --> 52:31.145
Over here! Over here!

52:31.146 --> 52:33.940
Nobody over here.

52:33.941 --> 52:37.110
Yo, come on! We got him!

52:37.111 --> 52:39.028
I think we got him! We got him! Yeah!

52:39.029 --> 52:44.029
Over here. Over here. Move it!

52:47.288 --> 52:48.663
Oh! Shit!

52:48.664 --> 52:53.664
- It's not him.
- That's not Troy?

52:53.669 --> 52:54.919
Son of a...

52:54.920 --> 52:56.296
bitch.

52:56.297 --> 52:58.006
Fuck off.

52:58.007 --> 52:59.924
I got him! I got him!

52:59.925 --> 53:04.925
No! Don't shoot!
Those barrels are full of gas.

53:07.891 --> 53:12.891
- Oh!
- Damn!

53:14.356 --> 53:17.734
What the hell is that stuff?

53:17.735 --> 53:22.735
- Whoa!
- God!

53:57.358 --> 53:58.524
That's enough.

53:58.525 --> 53:59.942
No need to fill the tank.

53:59.943 --> 54:02.445
Scranton's only 65 miles away.

54:02.446 --> 54:03.863
We could really use some weapons.

54:03.864 --> 54:06.074
Food, canned goods, water.

54:06.075 --> 54:07.283
Um, lip gloss?

54:07.284 --> 54:09.202
The lip gloss you can have.

54:09.203 --> 54:11.079
The rest of this shit is ours.

54:11.080 --> 54:12.455
All of it?

54:12.456 --> 54:14.499
Every last can of peas.

54:14.500 --> 54:18.086
Well, what if we said we're not leaving
till we get what we need?

54:18.087 --> 54:20.254
What would you do, kill us?

54:20.255 --> 54:22.757
I'd think about it.

54:22.758 --> 54:24.550
But I don't think you'd do it, though.

54:24.551 --> 54:26.761
It's easier just to give us
what we need, isn't it'?

54:26.762 --> 54:29.680
'Cause otherwise, guess what,
you're gonna have to kill us.

54:29.681 --> 54:31.432
- Deb.
- Shut up, Jay.

54:31.433 --> 54:32.767
You're gonna have to kill us,

54:32.768 --> 54:35.770
'cause we're not leaving
until we get what we need.

54:43.237 --> 54:45.696
Okay.

54:45.697 --> 54:48.783
Fill her up.

54:48.784 --> 54:53.784
Give them what they want.

54:54.123 --> 54:55.373
- Come and get 'em!
- I'm so excited.

54:55.374 --> 54:57.291
- Come and get 'em!
- Access enough for you?

54:57.292 --> 54:58.876
Come and get 'em!

54:58.877 --> 55:00.294
That'll do.

55:00.295 --> 55:02.422
Gotta defend yourself. Got to.

55:02.423 --> 55:05.675
'Cause if this keeps up, people start
running out of food, water, gas.

55:05.676 --> 55:08.344
They're gonna start shooting at each other.

55:08.345 --> 55:10.012
No, thank you.

55:10.013 --> 55:12.348
I've had enough of this kind of thing.

55:12.349 --> 55:14.183
This is more like it.

55:14.184 --> 55:16.394
I'd rather have this, if you don't mind.

55:16.395 --> 55:18.312
It seems...

55:18.313 --> 55:23.313
friendlier, somehow.

55:24.027 --> 55:27.572
Hey.

55:27.573 --> 55:32.285
I think you're a lot like me.

55:32.286 --> 55:34.412
Good luck.

55:34.413 --> 55:39.413
Good luck to you, too.

55:45.215 --> 55:46.549
- We here.
- What is that?

55:46.550 --> 55:48.509
- Anyone listening?
- Where is it coming from?

55:48.510 --> 55:50.636
I found her on
a message board on YouTube.

55:50.637 --> 55:52.847
Someone listen.

55:52.848 --> 55:55.308
We Tokyo.

55:55.309 --> 55:57.226
Very bad here.

55:57.227 --> 55:58.936
Very bad Tokyo.

55:58.937 --> 56:01.439
- Tokyo. Can you believe it?
- Aah!

56:01.440 --> 56:03.900
There's hundreds of posts
like this all over the world.

56:03.901 --> 56:07.904
He's got the technology.

56:07.905 --> 56:09.489
No, no, no.

56:09.490 --> 56:11.741
- No.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

56:11.742 --> 56:13.784
- Don't bury dead.
- Okay, it's back.

56:13.785 --> 56:15.745
First shoot in head.

56:17.623 --> 56:21.334
- Don't bury dead. First shoot in head.
- Something's gone wrong.

56:21.335 --> 56:22.877
- Wait.
- Damn it.

56:22.878 --> 56:24.128
Well, plug it in.

56:24.129 --> 56:26.339
I just charged it.

56:26.340 --> 56:28.257
Then it's not the phone, it's the service.

56:28.258 --> 56:33.258
The fucking service is going out.

56:35.265 --> 56:39.393
Nothing?
How can there be nothing?

56:39.394 --> 56:41.729
It's the towers.
The relay towers must be out.

56:41.730 --> 56:42.939
Jesus. All of them?

56:42.940 --> 56:44.857
Technology is terrific, Eliot,

56:44.858 --> 56:46.734
except when it doesn't work.

56:46.735 --> 56:48.444
Great.

56:48.445 --> 56:49.987
It won't be long

56:49.988 --> 56:51.155
before nothing works, darling.

56:51.156 --> 56:54.534
Nothing at all.

57:02.167 --> 57:04.293
The mainstream had vanished

57:04.294 --> 57:06.796
with all its power and money.

57:06.797 --> 57:08.923
Now it was just us--

57:08.924 --> 57:11.425
bloggers, hackers, kids.

57:11.426 --> 57:12.969
When there were three networks, three lied.

57:12.970 --> 57:14.178
You've got to trust somebody.

57:14.179 --> 57:16.639
Now that there are 400,000 people,

57:16.640 --> 57:18.432
you have 400,000 lies.

57:24.481 --> 57:26.315
The more voices there are,

57:26.316 --> 57:28.150
the more spin there is.

57:28.151 --> 57:30.736
The truth becomes
that much harder to find.

57:30.737 --> 57:33.656
In the end it's all just noise.

57:33.657 --> 57:36.867
...government is fully capable
of dealing with this crisis.

57:48.005 --> 57:49.797
We're in Scranton.

57:49.798 --> 57:53.050
This is Deb's house.

57:53.051 --> 57:54.719
I thought they'd be here by now.

57:54.720 --> 57:57.221
They were out, what, camping, right?

57:57.222 --> 57:58.431
Any idea where?

57:58.432 --> 57:59.974
They used to go
to some place in Virginia.

57:59.975 --> 58:01.434
West Virginia.

58:01.435 --> 58:02.685
You probably just beat them here.

58:02.686 --> 58:04.520
Maybe they hit traffic or something.

58:04.521 --> 58:05.688
We didn't hit any traffic.

58:05.689 --> 58:06.939
There is no traffic.

58:06.940 --> 58:09.191
And West Virginia
is only 100 miles away.

58:09.192 --> 58:11.152
If that's where they went.

58:11.153 --> 58:16.153
Yeah.

58:16.700 --> 58:18.534
I'm gonna wait inside.

58:18.535 --> 58:20.369
You guys should get back on the road.

58:20.370 --> 58:22.204
What? And just leave you here?

58:22.205 --> 58:24.790
This is where I grew up.
It's where I want to be.

58:24.791 --> 58:25.958
You guys all have homes, too.

58:25.959 --> 58:29.253
You should get going. Get out of here.

58:29.254 --> 58:31.714
Thanks for bringing me here.

58:31.715 --> 58:35.885
Thanks for everything.

58:35.886 --> 58:37.595
I guess I'll try to call you.

58:37.596 --> 58:40.514
I'll try to come back for you.

58:40.515 --> 58:41.724
Bye,Jay.

58:41.725 --> 58:43.517
Don't be an asshole.

58:43.518 --> 58:45.519
Can't just let her wait here alone.

58:45.520 --> 58:47.271
Hey.

58:47.272 --> 58:51.734
Mind if, uh,
maybe I hang out for a while, too?

58:51.735 --> 58:53.027
Yeah, okay.

58:53.028 --> 58:55.154
Uh, me, too?

58:55.155 --> 58:58.491
I need to pee again.

58:58.492 --> 58:59.992
Well, I can't sit in here anymore.

58:59.993 --> 59:01.327
I want to meet your little brother.

59:01.328 --> 59:02.703
Maybe he has a PlayStation.

59:02.704 --> 59:04.705
I'd like to meet your father.

59:04.706 --> 59:06.999
Maybe he has a bar.

59:07.000 --> 59:12.000
They always hide a key.

59:18.428 --> 59:19.929
Shit. Fuck.

59:19.930 --> 59:23.641
I don't remember if it's 102 or 201.

59:27.771 --> 59:30.147
It's probably wired on a single circuit.

59:30.148 --> 59:35.148
- Where's the breaker box?
- In the garage.

59:45.247 --> 59:48.124
I don't get it.

59:48.125 --> 59:51.585
They're here?

59:51.586 --> 59:53.045
Mom?

59:53.046 --> 59:54.422
Dad!

59:54.423 --> 59:55.589
Billy!

59:55.590 --> 59:57.007
Maybe they dropped off their stuff

59:57.008 --> 59:58.634
and went to the neighbor's or something.

59:58.635 --> 01:00:00.594
Maybe there was an evacuation--
like, a mandatory evacuation.

01:00:00.595 --> 01:00:01.929
No, they would have taken their car.

01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:03.139
No, no, there's buses, right?

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:06.267
When they evacuate places,
they bring in, like, buses and--

01:00:06.268 --> 01:00:07.601
- Mom?
- ...shit.

01:00:07.602 --> 01:00:09.103
Dad!

01:00:09.104 --> 01:00:10.604
Billy?

01:00:10.605 --> 01:00:11.605
Oh, fuck.

01:00:11.606 --> 01:00:12.940
Deb?

01:00:12.941 --> 01:00:17.941
What is it?

01:00:24.828 --> 01:00:27.371
Okay, they must have, like,
had an accident or something, right?

01:00:27.372 --> 01:00:29.582
Maybe-- Maybe they're at the hospital.

01:00:29.583 --> 01:00:31.917
I just hope it's not a hospital
like we went to.

01:00:31.918 --> 01:00:34.128
Okay.

01:00:34.129 --> 01:00:35.713
Okay, my dad would have been driving,

01:00:35.714 --> 01:00:39.633
and that means my mom
would have been in the passenger seat,

01:00:39.634 --> 01:00:43.471
so that's my mom's blood...

01:00:43.472 --> 01:00:44.805
there.

01:00:44.806 --> 01:00:45.848
And, um--

01:00:45.849 --> 01:00:49.643
And Billy would have been in the back,
so that means Billy is probably okay.

01:00:49.644 --> 01:00:52.188
- Debra.
- No, I'm sure of it. Billy must be okay.

01:00:52.189 --> 01:00:53.606
- Deb!
- What?

01:00:53.607 --> 01:00:54.648
- Okay, listen to me.
- What--

01:00:54.649 --> 01:00:56.609
You gotta know that this might be--

01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:57.651
this might be bad.

01:00:57.652 --> 01:00:59.445
I know. No, I do. I know, okay?

01:00:59.446 --> 01:01:00.654
Okay. Really.

01:01:00.655 --> 01:01:02.656
- Now, let's go inside. Come on.
- Okay.

01:01:02.657 --> 01:01:05.618
But don't think about your parents.

01:01:05.619 --> 01:01:07.369
Don't think about your little brother.

01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:08.621
We're gonna go in there,

01:01:08.622 --> 01:01:10.539
and we're gonna try
and find something, okay?

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:12.500
Something like an old doll.

01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:13.626
Yeah, okay.

01:01:13.627 --> 01:01:14.668
An old-- An old doll.

01:01:14.669 --> 01:01:17.046
Okay. What is her name?

01:01:17.047 --> 01:01:18.631
It's not a her, it's a him.

01:01:18.632 --> 01:01:20.174
It's a him.
Okay, you got a guy doll.

01:01:20.175 --> 01:01:22.051
Yeah, like Ken, you know?

01:01:22.052 --> 01:01:23.135
Like Ken and Barbie?

01:01:23.136 --> 01:01:24.386
Okay, like Ken, but not Ken.

01:01:24.387 --> 01:01:25.721
What's his name?

01:01:25.722 --> 01:01:30.722
What is his name?

01:01:31.019 --> 01:01:33.270
Michael.

01:01:33.271 --> 01:01:36.565
Like the archangel.

01:01:36.566 --> 01:01:37.691
Okay.

01:01:37.692 --> 01:01:40.236
So we're gonna go in there,
and we're gonna go look for Michael.

01:01:40.237 --> 01:01:42.780
Okay.

01:01:42.781 --> 01:01:44.573
Okay.

01:01:44.574 --> 01:01:46.909
I thought long and hard

01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:50.704
about whether to leave
this footage in the film.

01:01:50.705 --> 01:01:53.666
I decided in the end...

01:01:53.667 --> 01:01:56.043
to show you exactly what happened.

01:01:56.044 --> 01:01:57.920
Aah! Billy!

01:01:57.921 --> 01:02:00.381
Billy, no!

01:02:00.382 --> 01:02:03.050
Let me through! Deb!

01:02:03.051 --> 01:02:05.886
Aah! Billy! No, Billy!

01:02:05.887 --> 01:02:10.887
Aah! Billy!

01:02:12.227 --> 01:02:14.395
No!

01:02:14.396 --> 01:02:19.396
No!

01:02:23.697 --> 01:02:25.197
Daddy?

01:02:25.198 --> 01:02:30.198
Mommy?

01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:37.789
Mommy.

01:02:40.964 --> 01:02:45.964
I think it's time we left this place.

01:02:55.103 --> 01:02:57.396
By now we'd become part of it.

01:02:57.397 --> 01:02:59.648
Part of 24/7.

01:02:59.649 --> 01:03:03.193
It's strange how, looking at things,

01:03:03.194 --> 01:03:06.488
seeing things through a lens, a glass,

01:03:06.489 --> 01:03:09.491
rose-colored or shaded black,

01:03:09.492 --> 01:03:11.660
you become immune.

01:03:11.661 --> 01:03:15.080
You're supposed to be affected,
but you're not.

01:03:15.081 --> 01:03:17.666
I used to think it was just you out there,

01:03:17.667 --> 01:03:19.126
the viewers,

01:03:19.127 --> 01:03:20.336
but it's not.

01:03:20.337 --> 01:03:22.212
It's us as well,

01:03:22.213 --> 01:03:23.923
the shooters.

01:03:23.924 --> 01:03:27.843
We become immune, too--
inoculated

01:03:27.844 --> 01:03:30.179
so that whatever happens around us,

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.932
no matter how horrible it is,

01:03:32.933 --> 01:03:36.226
we just wind up taking it all in stride.

01:03:36.227 --> 01:03:38.771
Just another day.

01:03:38.772 --> 01:03:43.772
Just another death.

01:03:44.152 --> 01:03:48.405
It's gonna be okay, babe.

01:03:48.406 --> 01:03:53.406
It's gonna be okay.

01:04:00.543 --> 01:04:05.005
Hey, do you want to switch places?

01:04:05.006 --> 01:04:07.216
I could take the camera
for a while, then you could--

01:04:07.217 --> 01:04:10.970
Leave him alone, Trace.

01:04:10.971 --> 01:04:15.971
He's right where he wants to be.

01:04:23.316 --> 01:04:28.070
Hey, where'd you learn
how to use that thing?

01:04:28.071 --> 01:04:29.279
Eaton.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:32.241
Archery squad.

01:04:32.242 --> 01:04:33.283
Targets, of course.

01:04:33.284 --> 01:04:36.870
Nothing at all to do with...

01:04:36.871 --> 01:04:41.625
life and death.

01:04:41.626 --> 01:04:44.211
I used to have a steady hand.

01:04:44.212 --> 01:04:49.212
You still do.

01:04:49.509 --> 01:04:54.509
Thank you.

01:04:56.224 --> 01:04:58.308
Where's your home, Professor?

01:04:58.309 --> 01:05:00.310
Or where was it?

01:05:00.311 --> 01:05:01.311
Portsmouth.

01:05:01.312 --> 01:05:02.771
That's where it was.

01:05:02.772 --> 01:05:05.482
Such as it was.

01:05:05.483 --> 01:05:07.568
Not really a home.

01:05:07.569 --> 01:05:11.864
Just a place.

01:05:11.865 --> 01:05:14.658
I've never seen or imagined

01:05:14.659 --> 01:05:16.368
a home

01:05:16.369 --> 01:05:21.331
that I could wish or want for my own.

01:05:21.332 --> 01:05:23.083
Sad.

01:05:23.084 --> 01:05:26.336
Not at all.

01:05:26.337 --> 01:05:27.337
Mine is a--

01:05:27.338 --> 01:05:29.715
a wandering spirit.

01:05:29.716 --> 01:05:34.716
Yeah, he wanders to wherever
there's a bottle of spirits.

01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:41.185
Alas.

01:05:41.186 --> 01:05:42.644
Where are we going, Eliot?

01:05:42.645 --> 01:05:44.104
I'd like to get to my place.

01:05:44.105 --> 01:05:46.356
We talked to Ridley.

01:05:46.357 --> 01:05:47.941
When?

01:05:47.942 --> 01:05:49.526
At the warehouse online.

01:05:49.527 --> 01:05:50.944
He's okay?

01:05:50.945 --> 01:05:52.654
Yeah, him and Franny sounded great.

01:05:52.655 --> 01:05:54.156
He invited us to come.

01:05:54.157 --> 01:05:55.783
Philadelphia?

01:05:55.784 --> 01:05:58.118
Could make it there before dawn.

01:05:58.119 --> 01:06:03.119
Hey, hey, hey. Look at this.

01:06:03.249 --> 01:06:05.167
It's the Guard.

01:06:05.168 --> 01:06:10.168
It's the fucking Guard!

01:06:10.381 --> 01:06:13.217
Call me crazy,
but those guys don't look dead.

01:06:14.385 --> 01:06:15.636
You see?

01:06:15.637 --> 01:06:20.637
I told you they'd show up.

01:06:23.394 --> 01:06:25.687
Hi, there.

01:06:25.688 --> 01:06:27.940
Is it nice to see you guys.

01:06:27.941 --> 01:06:31.401
Good.

01:06:31.402 --> 01:06:32.402
What's with the camera?

01:06:32.403 --> 01:06:34.238
Just making a movie.

01:06:34.239 --> 01:06:39.239
Oh, is that so?

01:06:43.414 --> 01:06:45.749
Where'd you get all the stuff?

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:49.711
Friends.

01:06:49.712 --> 01:06:51.588
You know, seems to be
a whole lot of folks

01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:56.589
getting a whole lot of stuff
from a whole lot of friends.

01:06:57.387 --> 01:07:01.431
Can we be friends?

01:07:01.432 --> 01:07:06.432
Want to turn that off, son?

01:07:06.563 --> 01:07:11.563
Turn it the fuck off.

01:07:11.568 --> 01:07:16.029
Now.

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:34.460
There's your fucking
National Guard, Tony.

01:07:35.341 --> 01:07:36.550
They stole everything we got.

01:07:36.551 --> 01:07:38.802
Not everything.
They left us our weapons.

01:07:38.803 --> 01:07:40.012
Sure, but they have their own.

01:07:40.013 --> 01:07:42.639
They're military men.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.433
With the world being what it is,

01:07:44.434 --> 01:07:47.477
they knew we wouldn't
survive without weapons.

01:07:47.478 --> 01:07:50.063
They're not murderers, just thieves.

01:07:50.064 --> 01:07:52.649
The world being what it is.

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:54.193
Think about that.

01:07:54.194 --> 01:07:56.278
From now on,

01:07:56.279 --> 01:07:58.488
everyone who dies...

01:07:58.489 --> 01:08:00.365
is gonna come back.

01:08:00.366 --> 01:08:02.951
I mean, think about that.

01:08:02.952 --> 01:08:04.912
Everyone who dies,

01:08:04.913 --> 01:08:06.747
unless they get a bullet in the head,

01:08:06.748 --> 01:08:10.334
is gonna come back
and try to kill somebody else.

01:08:10.335 --> 01:08:15.335
And on and on and on.

01:08:15.757 --> 01:08:20.756
Forever.

01:08:23.598 --> 01:08:24.640
Turn your helmet cams on.

01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:31.309
See anyone alive, pull them out.

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:34.316
Hey! Anyone in there?

01:08:34.317 --> 01:08:36.401
Anybody home?

01:08:36.402 --> 01:08:37.736
- Wait. Hold it.
- Don't go in there!

01:08:37.737 --> 01:08:39.404
Do not open that door!

01:08:39.404 --> 01:08:40.529
Hold it! Hold it!

01:08:40.531 --> 01:08:42.323
Hey, are you all right, mister?

01:08:42.325 --> 01:08:43.325
- Don't!
- Are you all right?

01:08:43.326 --> 01:08:44.533
You can't go in there!

01:08:44.535 --> 01:08:46.536
What are you hiding in there, old man?

01:08:46.537 --> 01:08:51.537
No! No, please!

01:09:00.093 --> 01:09:02.551
There's nobody in here.
I don't see anything.

01:09:03.554 --> 01:09:07.808
Aah!

01:09:07.809 --> 01:09:09.559
Son of a bitch!

01:09:14.564 --> 01:09:19.564
Over there! Behind you!

01:09:25.033 --> 01:09:27.493
You fucking dick!

01:09:27.495 --> 01:09:28.662
No! No!

01:09:28.662 --> 01:09:30.831
Hiding these fucking dead
pieces of meat in here?

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:33.417
- Look what happens! Look what happens!
- Please don't!

01:09:33.417 --> 01:09:34.584
- No!
- They were family.

01:09:34.585 --> 01:09:36.712
- Kill him.
- They were family!

01:09:36.712 --> 01:09:41.712
- Kill the prick!
- No, don't shoot.

01:09:44.679 --> 01:09:46.680
Don't shoot him in the head.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.682
Shoot him in the heart.

01:09:48.683 --> 01:09:53.683
Let him fucking wake up dead.

01:10:03.781 --> 01:10:08.781
It used to be us against us.

01:10:13.249 --> 01:10:15.709
Now it's us against them.

01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:16.710
He was right.

01:10:16.711 --> 01:10:19.671
Us against them.

01:10:19.672 --> 01:10:22.007
Except they...

01:10:22.008 --> 01:10:27.008
are us.

01:10:31.893 --> 01:10:34.269
I know it's around here someplace.

01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:35.645
Right here. Here.

01:10:35.646 --> 01:10:36.730
Here it is.

01:10:36.731 --> 01:10:41.731
Wake up, guys.
Guys, come on! Wake up!

01:10:42.737 --> 01:10:45.030
Oh, man. It's huge.

01:10:45.031 --> 01:10:47.282
It's like what God might have built

01:10:47.283 --> 01:10:48.784
if only He had the money.

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:55.248
Ridley made this place
sound like a fortress.

01:10:55.249 --> 01:10:57.209
Um, I've never been to a fortress before,

01:10:57.210 --> 01:11:01.004
but don't they usually
keep the doors locked?

01:11:01.005 --> 01:11:02.756
I told you. He said everything was cool.

01:11:02.757 --> 01:11:07.757
Well, that was yesterday.

01:11:31.411 --> 01:11:33.787
Plenty of security.

01:11:33.788 --> 01:11:35.914
There's gotta be monitors
around here somewhere.

01:11:35.915 --> 01:11:38.500
Monitors don't do us any good
unless somebody's watching.

01:11:38.501 --> 01:11:42.421
Someone might be
watching us right now.

01:11:42.422 --> 01:11:45.507
Okay. Let's go in.

01:11:45.508 --> 01:11:48.844
Wait, wait. Go back. Step back.

01:11:48.845 --> 01:11:53.845
I want to cover everything.

01:11:57.311 --> 01:12:02.311
Okay. Ready. Come in!

01:12:08.948 --> 01:12:11.366
I can't do this anymore.

01:12:11.367 --> 01:12:13.577
Every time we walk in somewhere,
somebody dies.

01:12:13.578 --> 01:12:15.370
Or somebody's already dead.

01:12:15.371 --> 01:12:17.581
It's gonna be the same everywhere we go.

01:12:17.582 --> 01:12:22.582
Shut the door.

01:12:24.005 --> 01:12:26.965
Ridley?

01:12:26.966 --> 01:12:29.217
Ridley!

01:12:29.218 --> 01:12:30.469
Francine?

01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:35.470
Hello!

01:12:40.688 --> 01:12:45.688
Ridley?

01:12:56.078 --> 01:12:58.246
Well, this is where the party was.

01:12:58.247 --> 01:13:00.415
Good Lord.

01:13:00.416 --> 01:13:03.877
Treasures. Absolute treasures.

01:13:03.878 --> 01:13:06.004
A Tale of Two Cities.

01:13:06.005 --> 01:13:07.839
First edition.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:10.717
Do you have any idea what this is worth?

01:13:10.718 --> 01:13:12.344
It was the best of times,

01:13:12.345 --> 01:13:16.723
it was the worst of times.

01:13:17.725 --> 01:13:18.892
- Well.
- Ridley!

01:13:18.893 --> 01:13:20.435
You scared us half to death!

01:13:20.436 --> 01:13:22.729
You came. Oh, this is great.

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:26.900
This is just so fucking great
to have all you guys here.

01:13:26.901 --> 01:13:28.485
How you doing, bro?

01:13:28.486 --> 01:13:30.487
- Where's Francine?
- Where are your parents?

01:13:30.488 --> 01:13:32.906
- Out back.
- Why was the front door open?

01:13:32.907 --> 01:13:34.783
Oh, was it?

01:13:34.784 --> 01:13:36.159
I was outside. Just came back in.

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.494
Must not have shut it behind me.

01:13:37.495 --> 01:13:38.745
Stupid.

01:13:38.746 --> 01:13:40.705
Just stupid. You know me.

01:13:40.706 --> 01:13:41.748
I'm stupid.

01:13:41.749 --> 01:13:43.750
What's in there?

01:13:43.751 --> 01:13:46.461
- The panic room.
- Wow.

01:13:46.462 --> 01:13:48.630
What's going on?
Why were you in there?

01:13:48.631 --> 01:13:50.382
Just checking the generator, that's all.

01:13:50.383 --> 01:13:51.758
Everything's fine.

01:13:51.759 --> 01:13:53.677
Even better now that you're here.

01:13:53.678 --> 01:13:55.262
God!

01:13:55.263 --> 01:13:58.598
It is just so great
to have you guys here!

01:14:00.101 --> 01:14:01.643
You must be totally burned.

01:14:01.644 --> 01:14:02.769
What can I get for you?

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:04.020
Something to eat? Drink?

01:14:04.021 --> 01:14:05.522
A cocktail would be lovely.

01:14:05.523 --> 01:14:07.774
Well, the bar is right over there.

01:14:07.775 --> 01:14:09.401
I'd like to get this damned corset off.

01:14:09.402 --> 01:14:11.403
Can you help me?

01:14:11.404 --> 01:14:13.446
You know what I'd like?

01:14:13.447 --> 01:14:15.991
A long, hot bath.

01:14:15.992 --> 01:14:18.201
Pick a bathroom. We've got six.

01:14:18.202 --> 01:14:19.786
Clean towels, soap, shampoo.

01:14:19.787 --> 01:14:21.580
Whatever you need. Whatever.

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:25.500
So nobody's tried
to break in or anything?

01:14:25.501 --> 01:14:27.794
Nobody around to break in.

01:14:27.795 --> 01:14:29.921
We're pretty isolated out here.

01:14:29.922 --> 01:14:32.048
Country club's closer
than the next house,

01:14:32.049 --> 01:14:36.970
but not too many people
interested in golf or tennis these days.

01:14:36.971 --> 01:14:38.930
Where's your stuff?

01:14:38.931 --> 01:14:41.016
You must have brought
some stuff with you.

01:14:41.017 --> 01:14:42.809
Dirty clothes. Bags of them.

01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:44.978
Well, bring it in. Bring it all in.

01:14:44.979 --> 01:14:48.023
Something tells me you're
gonna be here for a while.

01:14:48.024 --> 01:14:49.774
I'll go to the Winnie.

01:14:49.775 --> 01:14:52.319
I'll come with you.
I'd like to grab that other camera.

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.614
Yeah, 'cause one's never enough.

01:14:55.615 --> 01:14:57.115
Here, you take this one.

01:14:57.116 --> 01:14:59.200
No, no. I don't want
to make this kind of movie.

01:14:59.201 --> 01:15:01.119
I don't want to make
this kind of movie, either,

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.204
but I can't change the script.

01:15:03.205 --> 01:15:04.623
Here. See if you can resist.

01:15:04.624 --> 01:15:06.249
I don't want to do this.

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:07.876
Jason.

01:15:07.877 --> 01:15:09.544
Jason, I don't want to do this.

01:15:23.559 --> 01:15:28.559
My father shot a rabbit!

01:15:31.233 --> 01:15:36.233
I thought it was in here.

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:38.948
Oh!

01:15:38.949 --> 01:15:40.492
Hmm. Tony.

01:15:40.493 --> 01:15:41.826
You're filming.

01:15:41.827 --> 01:15:45.163
I guess Jason was right.
You can't resist.

01:15:45.164 --> 01:15:48.667
I'm filming you, Ridley,
'cause you're acting a little weird.

01:15:48.668 --> 01:15:50.710
All this shit that's been going on.

01:15:50.711 --> 01:15:52.962
I know.

01:15:52.963 --> 01:15:55.674
I know what's going on.

01:15:55.675 --> 01:15:58.593
Still a little bit tired and--

01:15:58.594 --> 01:16:00.720
and a little drunk.

01:16:00.721 --> 01:16:02.847
That's all.

01:16:02.848 --> 01:16:03.973
Forget the rabbit.

01:16:03.974 --> 01:16:06.559
- Ridley?
- How about some pheasant?

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.727
Father shot two of those.

01:16:07.728 --> 01:16:09.521
They're downstairs
in one of the big freezers.

01:16:09.522 --> 01:16:13.692
Ridley, can we go see Francine now?

01:16:13.693 --> 01:16:15.735
She's out back...

01:16:15.736 --> 01:16:18.446
with my family and the staff.

01:16:18.447 --> 01:16:19.864
Yeah, you said that.

01:16:19.865 --> 01:16:24.202
Why don't we go see her?

01:16:24.203 --> 01:16:26.538
I don't think we should do that.

01:16:26.539 --> 01:16:29.666
- Why?
- Well...

01:16:29.667 --> 01:16:31.626
to begin with...

01:16:31.627 --> 01:16:34.003
Father's dead.

01:16:34.004 --> 01:16:35.547
He was the first one to die.

01:16:35.548 --> 01:16:38.717
Then he did Mother,
and then they both did the staff.

01:16:38.718 --> 01:16:42.429
Brannigan, Brenda, Cook.

01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:44.681
Really liked Cook.

01:16:44.682 --> 01:16:46.725
Maybe she ate the rabbit.

01:16:46.726 --> 01:16:51.726
Did somebody eat Francine?

01:16:51.939 --> 01:16:54.941
Did somebody eat Francine?

01:16:54.942 --> 01:16:57.944
No.

01:16:57.945 --> 01:17:00.613
Well...

01:17:00.614 --> 01:17:02.449
no, not exactly.

01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:06.619
I mean, Brannigan bit her on her face.

01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:08.621
I think. I don't know.

01:17:08.622 --> 01:17:09.998
It all happened so fast.

01:17:09.999 --> 01:17:11.624
I think we should get out of here.

01:17:11.625 --> 01:17:12.709
Wait. Ridley?

01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:14.294
You're saying they're all dead.

01:17:14.295 --> 01:17:16.254
Yes.

01:17:16.255 --> 01:17:21.255
I had to bury them.

01:17:22.845 --> 01:17:27.515
Is no one else hungry?

01:17:27.516 --> 01:17:29.434
I didn't bury them in the garden.

01:17:29.435 --> 01:17:33.646
I'd never dig up Mother's roses.

01:17:33.647 --> 01:17:35.648
It's okay. Come on.

01:17:35.649 --> 01:17:37.984
I had to chop off Cook's hand.

01:17:37.985 --> 01:17:42.985
That's why there's so much blood.

01:17:43.282 --> 01:17:46.534
Shit.

01:17:46.535 --> 01:17:51.535
Come on.

01:17:54.668 --> 01:17:56.211
Maybe we should get out of here.

01:17:56.212 --> 01:17:58.838
No, I gotta see this.

01:17:58.839 --> 01:18:03.839
Guys.

01:18:16.857 --> 01:18:19.692
It's a little hard to see.

01:18:19.693 --> 01:18:24.693
Here, I'll turn on the lights.

01:18:26.033 --> 01:18:31.033
This is where I buried them.

01:18:34.708 --> 01:18:39.671
Sweet Jesus.

01:18:39.672 --> 01:18:42.882
- He's gone.
- There was blood on his arm.

01:18:42.883 --> 01:18:47.883
I wonder if he got bitten.

01:19:29.722 --> 01:19:34.722
Guys?

01:19:36.562 --> 01:19:41.562
Darlings?

01:20:04.089 --> 01:20:06.132
Jason, a little help here?

01:20:06.133 --> 01:20:11.133
I'm shooting.

01:20:11.597 --> 01:20:15.642
Oh, Ridley.
Can you give me a hand?

01:20:15.643 --> 01:20:17.810
- Aah!

01:20:17.811 --> 01:20:19.228
Jesus, he's dead.

01:20:19.229 --> 01:20:23.608
He's fucking dead.

01:20:23.609 --> 01:20:26.819
Oh, fuck.

01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:28.237
Jason!

01:20:28.238 --> 01:20:29.614
A little help here?

01:20:29.615 --> 01:20:30.615
Hey! Run!

01:20:30.616 --> 01:20:35.616
Run, Tracy!

01:20:39.708 --> 01:20:43.127
See? I told you
dead things move slow!

01:20:47.633 --> 01:20:52.633
Where the fuck did they go?

01:20:52.638 --> 01:20:56.182
Tracy? Tracy!

01:20:56.183 --> 01:20:58.977
Tracy!

01:20:58.978 --> 01:21:00.561
Oh, shit.

01:21:00.562 --> 01:21:02.063
I don't believe this.

01:21:02.064 --> 01:21:03.606
I don't fucking believe this!

01:21:03.607 --> 01:21:06.693
Just like your goddamn mummy movie!

01:21:06.694 --> 01:21:10.655
Jason, put down that
stupid camera and help me!

01:21:10.656 --> 01:21:11.990
Aah!

01:21:11.991 --> 01:21:15.952
Aah!

01:21:15.953 --> 01:21:17.245
You getting this, Jason?

01:21:17.246 --> 01:21:22.246
I hope you're happy, you son of a bitch!

01:21:24.003 --> 01:21:26.254
Hey! Hey!

01:21:26.255 --> 01:21:28.256
This isn't a movie, Jason. It's real!

01:21:28.257 --> 01:21:29.465
I'm trying to distract him.

01:21:29.466 --> 01:21:31.467
Cut! Cut!

01:21:31.468 --> 01:21:35.680
Cut!

01:21:38.684 --> 01:21:40.393
Don't mess with Texas.

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.697
Tracy!

01:21:54.491 --> 01:21:56.617
Tracy!

01:21:56.618 --> 01:21:57.744
I'm leaving you, Jason.

01:21:57.745 --> 01:22:02.745
You can keep the house.
I'll take the car.

01:22:07.713 --> 01:22:09.172
Shit.

01:22:09.173 --> 01:22:10.590
I don't believe this.

01:22:10.591 --> 01:22:11.799
What is she, nuts?

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.967
Where does she think she's going?

01:22:12.968 --> 01:22:17.968
She's not going for Chinese.

01:22:18.682 --> 01:22:19.891
You know what? It's okay.

01:22:19.892 --> 01:22:21.350
We-- We still got Ridley's car.

01:22:21.351 --> 01:22:22.769
There's other cars in the garage.

01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:24.604
- We could still get out of here.
- No, bad idea.

01:22:24.605 --> 01:22:27.523
Look, Ridley is still moping around
somewhere, dead or alive.

01:22:27.524 --> 01:22:31.027
And there are human goldfish
in the fucking pool.

01:22:31.028 --> 01:22:32.820
We just spent the last
two days on the road.

01:22:32.821 --> 01:22:34.822
- Did you have a good time?
- No, but--

01:22:34.823 --> 01:22:36.783
Out there, we're lunch.

01:22:36.784 --> 01:22:37.825
In here,

01:22:37.826 --> 01:22:39.577
there is a steel-reinforced panic room

01:22:39.578 --> 01:22:44.578
where could sit and play Nintendo
until this whole thing blows over.

01:23:09.650 --> 01:23:10.858
Shit!

01:23:10.859 --> 01:23:12.860
Don't, Deb! It's me.

01:23:12.861 --> 01:23:14.570
Jesus.

01:23:14.571 --> 01:23:15.988
Jesus.

01:23:15.989 --> 01:23:17.156
Where's Ridley?

01:23:17.157 --> 01:23:18.241
Have you seen him?

01:23:18.242 --> 01:23:21.202
Yeah, he's not Ridley anymore.

01:23:21.203 --> 01:23:23.204
He's something else.

01:23:23.205 --> 01:23:25.206
Eliot is something else, too, I'm afraid.

01:23:25.207 --> 01:23:26.541
What?

01:23:26.542 --> 01:23:29.752
Or gone.

01:23:29.753 --> 01:23:33.256
Died in a tub of water
with Ridley in his arms.

01:23:33.257 --> 01:23:35.591
- How do you know all this?
- I saw it on TV, darling.

01:23:35.592 --> 01:23:39.303
I took my bourbon, and I went in
to watch the monitors.

01:23:39.304 --> 01:23:40.680
I went into the panic room,

01:23:40.681 --> 01:23:45.681
which I suggest is a good place
for us all to go right now.

01:23:49.231 --> 01:23:52.984
Always fancied myself a swashbuckler.

01:23:52.985 --> 01:23:54.694
You're drunk, Professor.

01:23:54.695 --> 01:23:55.987
Indeed I am.

01:23:55.988 --> 01:23:59.657
But drunkenness has, oddly,
regretfully,

01:23:59.658 --> 01:24:03.161
never twisted my perceptions
of things going on around me.

01:24:03.162 --> 01:24:05.621
Tracy's phone. Let's go.

01:24:05.622 --> 01:24:07.832
- No.
- Jason.

01:24:07.833 --> 01:24:10.543
We can't just lock ourselves
in a fucking room.

01:24:10.544 --> 01:24:12.295
We'd be locking ourselves
out of the world.

01:24:12.296 --> 01:24:13.337
That's the whole point.

01:24:13.338 --> 01:24:16.549
We lock ourselves out of the world
before the world bites us on the ass.

01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:17.800
We've got weapons.

01:24:17.801 --> 01:24:20.678
We can take care of whatever comes.

01:24:20.679 --> 01:24:22.555
I can't go in there, Deb.

01:24:22.556 --> 01:24:24.307
I'll miss-- I'll miss everything.

01:24:24.308 --> 01:24:28.728
God damn it, Jason!
Would you stop this?

01:24:28.729 --> 01:24:30.396
Come with us.

01:24:30.397 --> 01:24:32.023
Be safe.

01:24:32.024 --> 01:24:33.733
Settle, like I'm trying to do.

01:24:33.734 --> 01:24:34.734
Settle for--

01:24:34.735 --> 01:24:36.652
- For what?
- For life.

01:24:36.653 --> 01:24:38.237
For survival.

01:24:38.238 --> 01:24:42.366
Survival? Who the fuck wants to survive
in a world like this?

01:24:42.367 --> 01:24:45.745
All that's left
is to record what's happening

01:24:45.746 --> 01:24:50.746
for whoever remains when it's over.

01:24:51.335 --> 01:24:54.879
Please.

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.880
I don't want to go in there without you.

01:25:03.722 --> 01:25:08.722
All right.

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:21.739
We can't.

01:25:30.999 --> 01:25:33.376
What was that?

01:25:33.377 --> 01:25:35.253
Where the hell is he?

01:25:38.882 --> 01:25:43.882
Oh, no.

01:25:44.137 --> 01:25:49.137
Oh, God.

01:25:49.643 --> 01:25:54.643
You fuck.

01:26:27.264 --> 01:26:32.264
Shoot me.

01:26:49.828 --> 01:26:51.203
Michael...

01:26:51.204 --> 01:26:56.204
the Archangel.

01:26:57.502 --> 01:26:59.879
Uh, ahem.

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:03.257
Hi, my name is Jay-- Jason Creed,

01:27:03.258 --> 01:27:06.719
and I have been given
the opportunity--

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:10.097
given the gift
to be able the document the events

01:27:10.098 --> 01:27:12.475
that have suddenly landed in my lap.

01:27:12.476 --> 01:27:14.268
And I just want to let you guys know--

01:27:14.269 --> 01:27:16.812
the audience know--
that I'm gonna do my best

01:27:16.813 --> 01:27:19.106
to capture the truth
with me and my friends.

01:27:19.107 --> 01:27:20.858
There's gonna be no fakeness.

01:27:20.859 --> 01:27:22.193
I'm gonna go after everything.

01:27:22.194 --> 01:27:23.861
Really raw, really real.

01:27:23.862 --> 01:27:27.615
And I'm going to do the best job I can.

01:27:27.616 --> 01:27:29.867
And I'm just really excited
to be given this opportunity.

01:27:29.868 --> 01:27:34.868
And I am not going to fuck it up.

01:27:35.582 --> 01:27:38.000
- Yeah.

01:27:38.001 --> 01:27:39.293
Debbie?

01:27:39.294 --> 01:27:42.838
Debra!

01:27:42.839 --> 01:27:47.839
Debra!

01:27:50.222 --> 01:27:55.222
Debra?

01:27:58.814 --> 01:28:02.691
Deb?

01:28:02.692 --> 01:28:07.692
I'm gonna finish his movie.

01:28:12.744 --> 01:28:14.995
The movie's over.

01:28:14.996 --> 01:28:18.124
No.

01:28:18.125 --> 01:28:21.961
There's gonna be more.

01:28:21.962 --> 01:28:24.088
There's gotta be more.

01:28:31.847 --> 01:28:34.473
Morning approaches.

01:28:34.474 --> 01:28:37.268
Things always look better
in the morning.

01:28:37.269 --> 01:28:39.270
Not to me.

01:28:39.271 --> 01:28:41.272
Mornings bring light.

01:28:41.273 --> 01:28:44.275
I prefer the darkness.

01:28:44.276 --> 01:28:47.153
It's easier to hide in the dark.

01:28:47.154 --> 01:28:48.988
You know what, Professor?

01:28:48.989 --> 01:28:52.283
I actually get the-- the mornings.

01:28:52.284 --> 01:28:56.787
They show you for what you are
instead of what you think you are.

01:28:57.789 --> 01:29:02.418
Inelegantly phrased, Mr. Ravello,
but accurately put.

01:29:02.419 --> 01:29:07.419
Mornings...and mirrors.

01:29:07.841 --> 01:29:10.759
I despise them.

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:14.805
Mornings and mirrors
only serve to terrify old men.

01:29:14.806 --> 01:29:17.433
Hey, could you say that again?

01:29:17.434 --> 01:29:21.437
I didn't get that.

01:29:21.438 --> 01:29:22.438
Et tu, darling ?

01:29:22.439 --> 01:29:27.439
Look at this.

01:29:47.464 --> 01:29:52.464
Close the door.

01:29:57.349 --> 01:30:00.518
Jason once said he thought he could help,

01:30:00.519 --> 01:30:03.479
maybe even save some lives.

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:07.608
This is the last thing
he downloaded before he died--

01:30:07.609 --> 01:30:10.778
a couple of hometown Joes
who went out to shoot at targets.

01:30:10.779 --> 01:30:13.614
But that day, they used people.

01:30:13.615 --> 01:30:15.533
Dead people.

01:30:15.534 --> 01:30:17.618
You know, just for fun?

01:30:19.204 --> 01:30:21.956
There was one target
that was different from the rest.

01:30:21.957 --> 01:30:23.457
A woman...

01:30:23.458 --> 01:30:26.627
tied by her hair to the branch of a tree.

01:30:26.628 --> 01:30:29.046
The boys had this one
set up just for kicks.

01:30:29.047 --> 01:30:29.880
The boys had this one
set up just for kicks.

01:30:29.881 --> 01:30:32.216
They got out their
favorite 12 gauge and--

01:30:36.388 --> 01:30:39.098
Are we worth saving?

01:30:39.099 --> 01:30:44.099
You tell me.
