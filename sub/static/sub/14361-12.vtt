(Crows cawing)

00:04.297 --> 00:08.118
<i>Since the dawn of time, trying to
get anywhere with your kids</i>

00:08.273 --> 00:09.675
<i>has been a challenge.</i>

00:10.121 --> 00:11.556
Oh, my God.
(Door closes)

00:11.663 --> 00:13.505
Why are you so late? I've been
standing out there forever.

00:13.617 --> 00:15.360
Look. I got a snotsicle.

00:15.495 --> 00:17.079
Put your coat on, you moron.

00:17.224 --> 00:17.901
Ugh.

00:18.020 --> 00:19.171
Brick couldn't find his book.

00:19.317 --> 00:20.641
And you can't go
to dinner like that.

00:20.762 --> 00:22.415
I'm gonna change.
Relax.

00:22.513 --> 00:23.939
Don't tell your mom to relax.

00:24.087 --> 00:26.722
(Exhales) Brick wants to go
to Don's Oriental Food.

00:26.852 --> 00:29.471
Ugh! No way. No foreign food.
I want spaghetti.

00:30.538 --> 00:32.345
(Scoffs) Hey, you just passed
the library <i>again.</i>

00:32.466 --> 00:33.337
Where are we going now?

00:33.463 --> 00:35.067
You said we'd go
after we picked up Axl.

00:35.195 --> 00:36.918
We will,
but after we pick up Sue.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.995
Oh, what? Can't we just
pick her up after dinner?

00:39.116 --> 00:39.973
I'm starving!

00:40.097 --> 00:41.800
Look, this is just
what we're doing, okay?

00:42.018 --> 00:43.057
(Groans)

00:44.563 --> 00:45.383
(Brakes squeal)

00:46.068 --> 00:47.183
Sue, get in.

00:47.710 --> 00:49.757
Aren't you guys gonna come in
and see the display?

00:49.888 --> 00:51.462
We got half the diabetes case.

00:51.589 --> 00:52.599
- Oh, sure.
(Axl) - No!

00:52.732 --> 00:55.349
(Brick) - Absolutely not.
- Fine. We'll go eat first

00:55.489 --> 00:56.448
and then come back and see it.

00:56.566 --> 00:57.585
Your brothers are hungry.

00:57.697 --> 00:58.843
<i>What? No.</i> But--

00:58.956 --> 01:01.130
Look, this is just
what we're doing, okay?

01:01.598 --> 01:02.839
(Window whirring)

01:04.391 --> 01:05.732
We're going for spaghetti.

01:05.853 --> 01:07.724
You said we could go
to Don's Oriental Food.

01:07.866 --> 01:08.834
No. No way.

01:08.976 --> 01:10.680
Last time we didn't get to go
where I wanted to go,

01:10.820 --> 01:12.309
so <i>I</i> get to choose this time.

01:12.433 --> 01:14.031
I want Rib Time America.

01:14.150 --> 01:14.952
I like ribs.

01:15.063 --> 01:15.930
- No!
- No.

01:16.057 --> 01:18.427
This is not fair.
I was promised.

01:18.573 --> 01:20.034
I ate hoagies against my will,

01:20.166 --> 01:23.110
and you promised next time
I'd get to pick, remember?

01:23.232 --> 01:24.270
Okay, where am I going?

01:24.410 --> 01:25.365
- Spaghetti!
- Rib Time America.

01:25.492 --> 01:26.429
The library.

01:26.570 --> 01:28.430
You should not even be allowed
to pick a restaurant.

01:28.552 --> 01:30.176
You are a terrible
restaurant picker.

01:30.294 --> 01:31.262
I am not!

01:31.385 --> 01:33.155
(Axl, Brick, Frankie, and Mike)
Colonial Diner.

01:33.298 --> 01:34.898
That was one time!

01:35.024 --> 01:36.085
I need a decision here.

01:36.208 --> 01:38.055
I don't understand why
we're not going to the library.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.488
And what is your problem
with Rib Time America, Axl?

01:40.632 --> 01:42.223
You <i>totally</i> like those fries.

01:42.357 --> 01:44.387
Aah! Axl, gross!

01:44.530 --> 01:45.308
(Hisses)

01:45.426 --> 01:46.317
- Axl.
- Axl.

01:46.438 --> 01:47.602
(Coughing) Oh, relax.

01:47.748 --> 01:49.438
I smell better
than all you put together.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.949
- Let's pick a place, people.
- I am starving!

01:52.079 --> 01:53.541
Hey, you just passed
the library <i>again.</i>

01:53.694 --> 01:55.565
We're not going
to the library right now.

01:55.693 --> 01:57.021
You were never gonna
take me, were you?

01:57.150 --> 01:59.425
Admit it! That's just what
you say to get me in the car!

01:59.555 --> 02:01.143
Okay, what are we doing?

02:01.264 --> 02:03.359
I got Don's to the left,
I got Ribs to the right.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.832
Left or right?
Left or right?

02:04.964 --> 02:06.864
- Right. Right. Right.
- I want to go to the library!

02:06.982 --> 02:08.201
- Spaghetti. Spaghetti. Spaghetti!
- Dad, please go to Ribs of America!

02:08.328 --> 02:09.187
- Spaghetti!
- I never get to do what I want!

02:09.324 --> 02:10.532
Please! You know--

02:10.930 --> 02:12.813
<i>So this is what we did.</i>

02:13.331 --> 02:14.082
(Dog barking in distance)

02:14.194 --> 02:16.109
All right.
You guys have school tomorrow.

02:16.238 --> 02:17.070
Why don't you get to bed?

02:17.198 --> 02:18.220
We're not tired.

02:18.350 --> 02:19.822
Well, we are.

02:20.262 --> 02:21.122
(Spoon clinks)

02:22.233 --> 02:23.361
Oh, I call the bathroom!

02:23.464 --> 02:25.049
(Sue) No fair!
You got it first last night!

02:25.174 --> 02:26.903
(Axl) Oh, you don't know
what's coming for you!

02:27.027 --> 02:29.083
Well, that was fun.
We should do that again.

02:29.201 --> 02:30.564
Ugh. All that fighting.

02:30.682 --> 02:32.998
It's just impossible to do
anything with these people.

02:33.150 --> 02:35.906
Wouldn't it be so much easier
if we only had one kid, hmm?

02:36.081 --> 02:37.033
Or none.

02:37.155 --> 02:38.731
No, seriously.
Think about it--

02:38.884 --> 02:41.042
how great would that be?
It-- it would be like

02:41.168 --> 02:42.262
"The Courtship
of Eddie's Father."

02:42.397 --> 02:43.401
Remember that show?

02:43.552 --> 02:45.857
They would just take these
long walks down the beach,

02:45.984 --> 02:48.789
just the two of them,
and talk and connect.

02:49.047 --> 02:50.121
What are we doing?

02:50.253 --> 02:52.882
We're referees--
sheepherding referees.

02:53.020 --> 02:54.201
We should get whistles.

02:54.319 --> 02:57.185
I mean, imagine
if it was just Axl today.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.014
We would have
gotten there early,

02:59.144 --> 03:00.672
seen a little of his practice.

03:00.797 --> 03:02.149
I've been wanting
to watch practice.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.110
Yeah. And we would have
had the time.

03:04.229 --> 03:05.901
Could have talked strategy
over spaghetti,

03:06.011 --> 03:07.324
gone over some plays.

03:07.464 --> 03:09.162
Right?
And if it was just Sue,

03:09.276 --> 03:10.872
we would have seen
her display case,

03:10.993 --> 03:13.789
taken her out for ribs,
caught up on her life.

03:13.912 --> 03:15.235
I like ribs.

03:15.418 --> 03:16.737
Brick could have gone
to the library

03:16.865 --> 03:18.778
and Don's Oriental Food.

03:18.911 --> 03:20.722
He gets really chatty
when he eats Chinese.

03:20.846 --> 03:22.301
I think it's the MSG.
(Sighs)

03:22.432 --> 03:24.505
And what's with Axl
and that rib place, huh?

03:24.640 --> 03:26.035
He was just being a jerk.

03:26.181 --> 03:28.009
He totally likes
the fries there.

03:28.134 --> 03:30.491
So we're agreed--
we'll give two back.

03:30.601 --> 03:31.929
Which one you wanna keep?

03:32.589 --> 03:33.816
Look, it is what it is.

03:33.998 --> 03:35.793
We'll never get 'em one on one.

03:36.181 --> 03:37.839
Wait.

03:38.609 --> 03:39.956
Why can't we?

03:40.513 --> 03:42.562
So listen, your dad
and I were thinking...

03:42.685 --> 03:43.662
- I am not cleaning the garage!
- You always do this.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.296
Weekends are our time to relax!

03:45.504 --> 03:47.945
(Sighs) This is something
that will benefit you.

03:48.133 --> 03:50.322
Instead of everyone running
around with everyone else

03:50.464 --> 03:51.369
and being miserable

03:51.508 --> 03:53.351
and having to do things
they don't want to do...

03:53.469 --> 03:54.399
Like this?

03:54.531 --> 03:55.261
(Sighs heavily)

03:55.384 --> 03:57.773
You each get to spend
a day with us alone.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.352
Each kid gets me
and your dad's full attention

04:00.486 --> 04:01.588
for one day.

04:01.735 --> 04:02.703
(Blows raspberry) Pass.

04:02.821 --> 04:04.345
Really?
A whole day?

04:04.470 --> 04:07.703
It's your day. We can spend it
in whatever way you choose.

04:07.822 --> 04:09.603
Oh, my God. One day
is not gonna be enough.

04:09.728 --> 04:10.640
You can have my day.

04:10.752 --> 04:11.971
No one's taking anybody's day.

04:12.107 --> 04:14.317
Okay, let's see.
I want an outside activity.

04:14.447 --> 04:15.425
I want an inside activity.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.165
I want an activity
we've never done together.

04:17.281 --> 04:18.716
I want an activity
that involves jumping.

04:18.845 --> 04:21.096
I want a mystery activity.
I want some reflection time.

04:21.223 --> 04:22.352
Oof.
Are you sure I can't dip

04:22.466 --> 04:23.726
into just a little bit
of Axl's day?

04:23.847 --> 04:26.019
I wanna go to the library. I'm
gonna show you the microfiche,

04:26.143 --> 04:28.240
and I wanna go through
the periodicals without rushing.

04:28.370 --> 04:30.915
(Yawns) Can I invite a friend
so I have someone to talk to?

04:31.038 --> 04:32.352
Nope. Now go.

04:32.502 --> 04:34.863
(Gasps) Okay. I'm gonna start
making my list. (Giggles)

04:38.110 --> 04:39.357
How 'bout a different plan?

04:39.481 --> 04:40.703
You and me take off
in the middle of the night

04:40.832 --> 04:42.152
and just drive.

04:50.115 --> 04:51.179
Axl.

04:51.329 --> 04:52.514
Come on, Axl.

04:52.639 --> 04:53.830
You're sleeping your day away.

04:53.958 --> 04:55.976
We've tried to wake you up
twice already.

04:56.114 --> 04:57.421
(Muffled) Take a hint.

04:57.588 --> 04:58.694
It's noon.
If we're gonna do anything,

04:58.803 --> 05:00.022
we gotta get this thing movin'.

05:00.146 --> 05:01.662
I already told you
I don't wanna go.

05:01.778 --> 05:04.470
I was an only child
for two years. I'm good.

05:05.942 --> 05:07.694
(Mike grunts) (Axl) Whoa.

05:08.312 --> 05:09.082
(Thud)

05:09.208 --> 05:10.713
Come on.
It's gonna be great.

05:10.848 --> 05:13.177
Just the three of us.
No siblings.

05:13.304 --> 05:15.420
It's all about you.
What do you wanna do?

05:15.728 --> 05:16.656
Well, I got one idea,

05:16.789 --> 05:18.470
but you're not
gonna wanna do it.

05:20.460 --> 05:23.668
(Popping, thudding) <i>(Man) Welcome
to Paintball Zone! Game on!</i>

05:23.924 --> 05:25.538
(Laughing)
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

05:25.774 --> 05:26.918
- Ho-ho!
- Got 'em.

05:27.103 --> 05:29.670
This is awesome.
Oh, I wanna join the army.

05:29.767 --> 05:31.507
Yeah, 'cause this is what war is like.
(Popping in background)

05:31.709 --> 05:34.007
<i>(Man over PA) The blue team</i>
<i>has been eliminated.</i>

05:34.145 --> 05:35.386
<i>Yes.</i>

05:35.882 --> 05:38.976
Oh. Hey. I've been looking
for you guys everywhere.

05:39.133 --> 05:40.468
We got the blue team, right?

05:40.586 --> 05:42.056
- Yeah.
- I was this close to getting one,

05:42.222 --> 05:44.389
- and then I tripped and shot myself.
- Oh.

05:44.657 --> 05:46.232
Hey, listen, I've been
doing some reconnaissance.

05:46.372 --> 05:49.252
The orange team is taking cover
behind that jeep over there.

05:49.373 --> 05:50.189
We gotta flush 'em out.

05:50.312 --> 05:52.176
I'm thinking one of us
lays down some suppressive fire,

05:52.308 --> 05:53.306
and the other two flank 'em

05:53.436 --> 05:54.557
by going over
that ridge over there.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.613
The only problem is, it leaves
all three of us vulnerable.

05:56.769 --> 05:58.707
(Exhales)
Ooh. Hey. I know.

05:58.850 --> 05:59.698
What about this instead?

05:59.832 --> 06:01.274
Mom, you see
that white pillar over there?

06:01.400 --> 06:02.837
You run to that
and draw their attention.

06:02.962 --> 06:04.115
That way we can
attack from here.

06:04.259 --> 06:06.909
I don't know.
That looks awfully far away.

06:07.037 --> 06:08.140
Won't I be exposed?

06:08.272 --> 06:10.091
You'll be okay.
Just run in a zigzag pattern.

06:10.208 --> 06:11.587
- Really?
- Well, if you yell, "don't shoot"

06:11.711 --> 06:13.016
over and over,
nobody'll shoot you.

06:13.185 --> 06:14.443
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:14.622 --> 06:16.187
Uh... (Exhales)
all right.

06:16.305 --> 06:17.516
Here I go.

06:17.835 --> 06:18.702
All right.

06:18.949 --> 06:19.853
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

06:19.957 --> 06:20.971
(Popping)
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

06:21.089 --> 06:22.880
Ow! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

06:23.040 --> 06:25.299
Aah! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

06:25.415 --> 06:26.269
(Popping) Ow, ow, ow!

06:26.388 --> 06:28.145
Aah! Oof!

06:28.644 --> 06:29.496
(Popping)

06:31.523 --> 06:33.681
(Laughs)
Yeah! (Laughs)

06:33.798 --> 06:34.853
- Got 'em!
- Whoo!

06:34.986 --> 06:36.791
And we only lost mom.
(Laughs)

06:40.373 --> 06:41.893
(Shouting in distance)

06:43.249 --> 06:45.624
Hey. There you are.

06:45.834 --> 06:47.062
Have you seen Axl?

06:47.195 --> 06:49.418
We had a whole plan worked out
to ambush the green team,

06:49.541 --> 06:51.390
and I've been circling
the perimeter for 20 minutes.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.599
I can't find him anywhere.

06:52.708 --> 06:54.588
(Popping, clanging)
All this strategy is boring.

06:54.747 --> 06:55.682
I thought we would have time

06:55.807 --> 06:58.067
to sit and talk with Axl
about his hopes and dreams.

06:58.226 --> 06:59.728
And instead I've just
been running around

06:59.851 --> 07:01.466
being target practice.

07:01.583 --> 07:03.412
Hey, our teenage son
is having a good time

07:03.538 --> 07:04.940
with us, his parents.

07:05.053 --> 07:05.942
You know how rare that is?

07:06.066 --> 07:08.105
That's like finding oil
in your backyard.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.342
You know,
I must really like you

07:13.477 --> 07:14.943
if I'm making out
with you in this.

07:15.071 --> 07:16.792
(Chuckles) What?
You don't think this is hot?

07:16.952 --> 07:18.480
You look so stupid.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.667
<i>You</i> look so stupid.

07:20.796 --> 07:22.248
(Both laugh)

07:22.417 --> 07:23.880
(Door opens)

07:24.211 --> 07:25.588
Aah! Aah! Aah!

07:26.084 --> 07:26.793
(Thud) Ooh.

07:26.894 --> 07:27.637
What are you doing?

07:27.750 --> 07:29.161
What? I don't know.
Nothing.

07:29.954 --> 07:31.677
I'm sorry.
Axl's in trouble here.

07:31.798 --> 07:33.704
Okay. Sorry.

07:35.299 --> 07:36.733
(Engine starts)

07:36.838 --> 07:38.721
Dude. (Scoffs)

07:38.926 --> 07:39.841
Bro code.

07:39.951 --> 07:41.202
What's the matter with you?

07:41.316 --> 07:43.141
You know, your mom was really
looking forward to this.

07:43.273 --> 07:44.738
She doesn't get to spend
a lot of time with you,

07:44.873 --> 07:46.384
and you're going
off to college next year.

07:46.527 --> 07:48.277
She was actually
having fun today,

07:48.393 --> 07:50.681
being with you,
and she thought you were, too.

07:50.968 --> 07:52.401
You're not gonna be
in our house that much longer.

07:52.523 --> 07:54.109
You can't give us
a couple hours of your time?

07:54.239 --> 07:56.057
You gotta go
pick up some random girl?

07:56.469 --> 07:58.898
Let's go. We're leaving.

08:00.019 --> 08:01.212
Look, I'm sorry I ran off,

08:01.342 --> 08:03.132
but she's not
just some random girl.

08:03.265 --> 08:05.224
She's my girlfriend, 'kay?

08:05.511 --> 08:06.785
You have a girlfriend?

08:07.486 --> 08:08.506
We've been dating
for, like, a month,

08:08.625 --> 08:10.673
but we haven't
told anybody yet.

08:11.262 --> 08:12.343
(Horn honks in distance)

08:12.451 --> 08:13.529
So you like her?

08:13.632 --> 08:15.133
I really like her.
(Chuckles)

08:15.254 --> 08:15.999
I don't know what it is,

08:16.177 --> 08:18.553
but I just wanna spend
every day with her, you know?

08:18.657 --> 08:20.923
Just wanna be with her
all the time.

08:21.073 --> 08:22.961
You ever feel like that
about anybody?

08:23.059 --> 08:25.207
Yeah. My old cat
at the quarry.

08:25.513 --> 08:27.124
And your mom, of course.

08:28.449 --> 08:30.307
So, a girlfriend, huh?

08:30.758 --> 08:31.765
Yeah.

08:31.881 --> 08:32.850
Well, good.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.162
Good. She seemed nice.

08:34.263 --> 08:36.696
Glad you told me.
Come on. We should be goin'.

08:38.951 --> 08:40.719
There you are.
Where have you been?

08:40.847 --> 08:41.934
Oh, hey, um, wait.

08:42.058 --> 08:43.404
Can we, like,
not tell mom about this?

08:43.528 --> 08:44.762
'Cause she's gonna ask
a million questions

08:44.904 --> 08:46.173
and be super annoying.

08:46.289 --> 08:47.093
I gotta tell her.

08:47.208 --> 08:48.469
I'll give you
a few seconds head start.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.523
Okay. (Chuckles) Hey.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.346
(Speaks inaudibly)

08:52.435 --> 08:55.013
<i>What?</i> Who is she?
When did he meet her?

08:55.138 --> 08:56.910
What's her name?
How long has he been seeing her?

08:57.043 --> 08:57.744
I can't believe...

08:57.862 --> 09:00.164
<i>Kid one-- done.</i>
<i>Check and check.</i>

09:08.044 --> 09:09.513
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up, wake up!

09:09.686 --> 09:11.623
It's my day.
It's my special day!

09:11.740 --> 09:13.821
(High-pitched voice)
Whoo-hoo!

09:14.188 --> 09:15.911
It's still dark outside.

09:16.036 --> 09:16.975
What time is it?

09:17.105 --> 09:17.930
It's 4:45.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.159
We just have so much to do

09:19.285 --> 09:20.204
that if we don't
get started now,

09:20.345 --> 09:21.762
we're never gonna
fit it all in.

09:21.870 --> 09:23.572
Come back in a couple of hours.

09:23.691 --> 09:26.100
I can't. "Watch the sun rise"
is on my list.

09:26.244 --> 09:27.602
See?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.548
Uh...

09:31.494 --> 09:32.686
(Groans)

09:33.740 --> 09:35.468
Oh...

09:35.615 --> 09:38.841
so pretty.

09:39.736 --> 09:40.924
(Exhales)

09:41.032 --> 09:41.955
All right. Let's go.

09:42.053 --> 09:43.545
We're petting puppies
at the shelter.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.034
<i>Well, be careful</i>
<i>what you wish for,</i>

09:45.153 --> 09:47.585
<i>'cause when Sue got a special</i>
<i>day, she wasn't kidding.</i>

09:47.703 --> 09:49.644
<i>We went to the doughnut place,</i>
<i>we painted mugs,</i>

09:49.770 --> 09:51.201
<i>we looked for animal shapes</i>

09:51.317 --> 09:52.572

09:58.714 --> 10:00.393
Oh, mom, you're really good.
<i>(Dance music playing)</i>

10:00.532 --> 10:02.542
You could have been on
the dance team in high school.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.339
Nah, I'm not that coordinated.

10:06.237 --> 10:07.814
Hey, why isn't dad playing?

10:07.997 --> 10:09.753
Uh, he's just tired.

10:10.117 --> 10:11.983
Was he like this yesterday
with Axl, too?

10:12.174 --> 10:15.113
Yeah. Yep, he was.

10:15.617 --> 10:18.117
Mike, come on. Get over here.
You gotta do this.

10:18.233 --> 10:19.512

Dad, you're doing great.

10:34.660 --> 10:35.880

Now.

10:39.879 --> 10:40.925
Oh, my God.

10:41.072 --> 10:43.689
Don's Oriental Food is <i>so</i> good.

10:43.823 --> 10:45.289
I see why Brick
likes it so much.

10:45.407 --> 10:46.806
Yep, that was a great day.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.173
Well, I'm beat.
What do you say we head home?

10:49.320 --> 10:50.680
No, no, no,
no, no. Wait.

10:50.811 --> 10:53.287
You promised we would get to see
your old prom dresses.

10:53.685 --> 10:55.837
Aw, sweetie, no, those are
all packed away somewhere

10:55.963 --> 10:57.442
over at Aunt Edie's.

10:57.565 --> 10:59.469
You always promise,
but we never do it.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.854
And this is supposed to be
<i>my</i> special day.

11:02.021 --> 11:04.974
(Sighs) That's the thing
about special--

11:05.121 --> 11:06.872
if you overload on special,

11:07.027 --> 11:08.954
it's not as special anymore.

11:09.071 --> 11:10.682
Axl and Brick never wanna go.

11:10.803 --> 11:13.135
If I don't go today,
I'll never get to go.

11:13.274 --> 11:15.576
And then one day, when I have
a daughter of my own,

11:15.738 --> 11:17.418
and she asks me
what I know about my mom

11:17.544 --> 11:18.445
from when she was young,

11:18.565 --> 11:19.850
I'll just have to say
"I don't know,"

11:19.980 --> 11:21.357
because even though
it was my special day,

11:21.500 --> 11:22.999
my mom didn't think
it was important enough to--

11:23.121 --> 11:24.815
(Slides) Here they are.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.164
Oh, wow. Yeah.

11:26.303 --> 11:27.581
This is from sophomore year.

11:27.694 --> 11:29.124
Went to prom
with Billy Petchell.

11:29.265 --> 11:31.143
He drove a yellow Pacer.
Mm-hmm.

11:31.312 --> 11:33.032
OMG.

11:33.167 --> 11:34.317
(Laughs) I know, right?

11:34.457 --> 11:35.968
It's so pretty.

11:36.132 --> 11:39.922
Look at those sleeves.
It's so glamorous.

11:40.055 --> 11:41.177
You should wear this.

11:41.305 --> 11:43.032
You could wear this
to cocktail parties.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.482
Oh... yeah.

11:44.634 --> 11:45.567
Oh.

11:46.576 --> 11:47.457
(Gasps)

11:47.648 --> 11:49.045
Wow!

11:49.224 --> 11:54.202
This is from my junior prom.
That was a crazy night.

11:54.355 --> 11:55.716
I drank so much...

11:56.596 --> 11:58.044
punch... yeah.

11:58.178 --> 12:00.520
We got really... excited.

12:00.649 --> 12:02.296
Sounds amazing.

12:02.549 --> 12:03.782
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

12:03.947 --> 12:06.673
This was my senior prom.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.827
Oh, my God.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.737
This one's my favorite.
Can I try this on?

12:10.900 --> 12:12.561
Go for it.
(Gasps)

12:13.746 --> 12:14.604
(Squeals)

12:16.903 --> 12:18.460
I'm gonna go to the kitchen

12:18.614 --> 12:22.094
and pour myself
a big glass of excitement.

12:22.211 --> 12:23.288
- You want anything?
- Yeah.

12:23.424 --> 12:25.074
I want my excitement
on the rocks.

12:25.246 --> 12:26.444
(Clicks tongue)

12:32.176 --> 12:33.342
Oh.

12:33.911 --> 12:34.999
(Door opens)

12:35.947 --> 12:37.885
(Gasps) Oh!

12:38.248 --> 12:39.986
You look beautiful.

12:40.108 --> 12:40.911
I know.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.570
Wouldn't this look pretty
with some purple wedges?

12:43.947 --> 12:44.931
Uh-huh.

12:45.053 --> 12:47.054
There's a lot of shoes
that would look good.

12:47.584 --> 12:48.781
Ooh. What's all this?

12:48.917 --> 12:51.138
Oh, I don't know. There's all
kinds of stuff in here.

12:51.431 --> 12:54.170
Ah! Look.
(Singsongy) Your yearbook.

12:54.299 --> 12:55.318
(Normal voice)
Let's look through it.

12:55.418 --> 12:55.978
Oh, no, no, no.

12:56.087 --> 12:57.051
That's okay.
We don't have to--

12:57.164 --> 12:59.594
Uh-oh. Are there
some bad pictures in here?

12:59.738 --> 13:01.448
(Laughs) Come on!

13:01.629 --> 13:04.362
Ooh. Here you are,

13:04.470 --> 13:07.304
chillin' on the lawn
with your friends.

13:07.431 --> 13:09.785
Here's one of you
on the football field...

13:10.104 --> 13:12.961
in a cheerleading uniform.

13:13.541 --> 13:15.415
You were a cheerleader?

13:15.540 --> 13:16.555
Was I?

13:16.678 --> 13:18.893
Oh, it was so long ago.
Who remembers?

13:19.263 --> 13:21.357
You were a cheerleader.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.324
Well... I guess I was,

13:23.451 --> 13:24.841
but only my senior year,

13:24.963 --> 13:26.402
just because they needed
somebody small

13:26.517 --> 13:27.942
for the top of the pyramid.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.807
(Gasps)
So you <i>were</i> coordinated.

13:31.036 --> 13:34.043
Why wouldn't you tell me
you were a cheerleader?

13:34.185 --> 13:36.128
I don't know.
I mean, who cares?

13:36.262 --> 13:39.273
Look at me now. It's not like
it translated into anything.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.019
Oh, my God.

13:41.427 --> 13:43.575
You were on prom court?

13:44.266 --> 13:46.814
I can't believe you didn't
tell me any of this.

13:47.011 --> 13:49.143
Why wouldn't you tell me?

13:49.296 --> 13:52.812
Is it because
you think I'm <i>not</i> that?

13:52.931 --> 13:54.852
No, Sue. I just...

13:55.153 --> 13:56.700
I don't know.

13:56.873 --> 13:59.230
I didn't want you to feel like
you had to live up

13:59.352 --> 14:00.627
to something I did.

14:00.761 --> 14:02.382
I wanted you
to live your own life

14:02.516 --> 14:05.084
and not have this idea
that you had to be like me.

14:05.216 --> 14:07.614
And honestly,
I know at your age

14:07.746 --> 14:11.476
all this stuff may seem
important, but it's not.

14:11.607 --> 14:13.052
It's like this dress.

14:13.179 --> 14:15.158
It was such a big deal
when I got it,

14:15.304 --> 14:16.285
and now look.

14:16.426 --> 14:18.520
It's hanging in the back
of Aunt Edie's closet,

14:18.654 --> 14:20.134
collecting dust.

14:20.755 --> 14:22.399
<i>(TV playing indistinctly)</i>

14:22.610 --> 14:25.098
You know what?
I think I would like to move

14:25.226 --> 14:27.608
my 10:00 PM reflection time
to now.

14:28.105 --> 14:28.714

14:28.863 --> 14:30.945
Oh. Okay.

14:53.564 --> 14:55.933
Okay. Well,
I thought about it,

14:56.060 --> 14:58.848
and...
I just realized something.

14:59.117 --> 15:00.867
If you were a cheerleader,

15:01.093 --> 15:03.910
that means I have
cheerleader DNA <i>in</i> me.

15:04.053 --> 15:06.201
I mean, you did all this
when you were a senior.

15:06.387 --> 15:08.149
I've got two years left.

15:08.310 --> 15:11.127
I was this close
to giving up on that dream.

15:11.259 --> 15:12.951
But there is no way now.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.581
I am going for it all.

15:14.702 --> 15:16.863
I am never gonna stop
trying out!

It's been a long weekend.

15:57.537 --> 15:59.544
I decided I don't
wanna go to the library.

15:59.662 --> 16:00.784
- Oh, good.
- Oh.

16:00.916 --> 16:03.424
I mean, we don't have to go
anywhere to have a special day.

16:03.521 --> 16:05.127
We can just watch TV all day.

16:05.244 --> 16:06.796
You always let me watch TV.

16:06.950 --> 16:11.501
Yes, but we'll let you
watch it in bed with us.

16:11.741 --> 16:13.289
No, I still wanna go somewhere.

16:13.419 --> 16:15.212
While I was waiting
for you guys to wake up,

16:15.348 --> 16:16.327
I read in the newspaper

16:16.458 --> 16:18.110
that there's
a "Planet Nowhere" convention

16:18.260 --> 16:19.937
in Indianapolis today.

16:20.523 --> 16:23.010
<i>Oh,</i> come on, Brick, no.

16:23.133 --> 16:25.662
It's a long drive
to Indianapolis.

16:25.783 --> 16:27.160
Perfect. It'll give me
plenty of time

16:27.286 --> 16:28.729
to fill you in on the series.

16:28.846 --> 16:30.179
See, what a lot
of people don't know

16:30.306 --> 16:31.659
about the "Planet Nowhere"
series

16:31.813 --> 16:33.354
is that it's an allegory.

16:33.521 --> 16:34.740
Now, all the tribes...

16:34.896 --> 16:36.372
And so, ironically,
for the Vernegos

16:36.503 --> 16:38.541
to ultimately
triumph over the Silligans,

16:38.693 --> 16:41.327
they must first
abandon their planet entirely

16:41.487 --> 16:44.054
and wander the galaxy
for-- you guessed it--

16:44.193 --> 16:45.783
11 centuries.

16:45.913 --> 16:47.252
(Exhales) Ugh.

16:47.438 --> 16:49.134
Yesterday's Don's Oriental Food

16:49.267 --> 16:50.575
is still not sitting so well.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.373
Don's? I wanted
to go there today.

16:52.506 --> 16:54.528
Yeah, there's no way
we're going there today.

16:54.657 --> 16:56.963
Oh. Well, then,
I want to go to...

16:57.077 --> 16:59.062
- Juanita's Cocina.
- Oh, no.

16:59.197 --> 17:00.832
We gotta give the Chinese
a chance to clear out

17:00.965 --> 17:02.718
before we let
any other countries in.

17:02.851 --> 17:04.711
(Burps) Sorry.
(Horn honks in distance)

17:04.813 --> 17:06.356
(Brakes squeal) Aw, I knew it.
Construction.

17:06.479 --> 17:08.441
Always there. They're never
gonna get this done.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.347
You know, Brick,

17:09.478 --> 17:11.284
there might be other
fun things we could do today.

17:11.413 --> 17:12.525
It-- it would be a shame

17:12.665 --> 17:14.734
to spend your special day
stuck in traffic.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.212
Well, I don't mind.

17:16.352 --> 17:17.988
Yeah, but we don't even
have tickets.

17:18.117 --> 17:18.896
I checked.

17:19.021 --> 17:20.733
There are plenty of tickets
available at the door.

17:20.864 --> 17:21.868
You know, they're probably
just gonna try

17:22.001 --> 17:23.198
to sell you a bunch of stuff.

17:23.332 --> 17:25.858
And by the time we get there,
it's gonna be so crowded.

17:26.002 --> 17:28.127
Sounds like you guys
don't wanna go.

17:28.270 --> 17:29.452
What? No, no.

17:29.574 --> 17:31.826
We want to do
whatever you want to do.

17:32.029 --> 17:33.044
We're just...

17:33.365 --> 17:36.390
scared that it won't live up
to your expectations.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.411
You went to 17 places with Sue.

17:39.539 --> 17:41.169
Did she tell you that?

17:41.299 --> 17:44.168
Because you're not supposed to
talk about each other's days.

17:44.363 --> 17:45.407
Oh, no.

17:45.524 --> 17:47.350
See those flakes?
Here it comes.

17:47.435 --> 17:48.740
First big storm of the winter.

17:48.861 --> 17:49.894
Oh. Well, that's it.

17:50.018 --> 17:51.017
We're gonna have to
turn around.

17:51.135 --> 17:53.815
But I'm-- I'm sure we can find
something much more fun.

17:54.363 --> 17:56.155
<i>(Muzak playing)</i>
Well, those look sharp.

17:56.377 --> 17:59.354
Is this my day?
Trying on shoes?

17:59.473 --> 18:01.751
Hey, you're always complaining
that I just bring you back shoes

18:01.875 --> 18:04.352
from the discount bin
when I'm shopping for Axl.

18:04.476 --> 18:05.792
We're not even here for me.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.275
This isn't my day.
We're running errands.

18:08.407 --> 18:09.276
(Sighs)

18:09.447 --> 18:11.182
Ooh. Look.

18:11.316 --> 18:13.331
Wanna play
with the size-y thing?

18:13.433 --> 18:14.691
You've never done that.

18:14.803 --> 18:15.686
I sort of like these boots.

18:15.791 --> 18:17.449
What do you think, Frankie?
For work?

18:17.576 --> 18:20.358
You see? Even my special day
isn't even for me.

18:20.491 --> 18:23.058
This is nothing
at all that I wanted. Nothing.

18:23.178 --> 18:24.757
That's it.
I'm gettin' the boots.

18:24.889 --> 18:27.100
Look, Brick, I'm just tired.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.599
I've got acid reflux.
I'm burping fire right now.

18:30.729 --> 18:32.402
Why don't we just
float your special day

18:32.536 --> 18:34.448
until we can
make it really special?

18:34.566 --> 18:36.380
You won't. I know you won't.

18:36.503 --> 18:37.494
- Brick--
- No.

18:37.636 --> 18:38.904
You do things
for everybody else.

18:39.041 --> 18:41.502
And by the time you get
around to me, you don't care.

18:41.637 --> 18:42.942
You don't have anything left.

18:43.068 --> 18:44.999
You don't even have
the energy to yell at me.

18:45.270 --> 18:46.515
You want us to yell at you?

18:46.640 --> 18:47.744
Yeah, sometimes!

18:47.861 --> 18:49.003
You yell at Axl and Sue.

18:49.165 --> 18:51.111
Once in a while
it'd be nice to know

18:51.231 --> 18:53.136
that you care enough
to yell at me, too.

18:53.270 --> 18:54.385
Look at this.

18:54.496 --> 18:57.986
I'm making a whole scene
in the shoe store, and nothing!

19:00.059 --> 19:01.049
(Clatters)

19:01.158 --> 19:02.831
Brick, look,

19:02.949 --> 19:04.795
I know it's tough
being the third child...

19:04.935 --> 19:05.783
(Yawning)
but I want you to know

19:05.928 --> 19:08.314
that we don't
take you for granted.

19:08.463 --> 19:10.668
And we love you, and...

19:11.315 --> 19:13.049
Mike, help me out here.

19:13.170 --> 19:15.496
I wonder
if these come in brown.

19:15.756 --> 19:17.605
Forget it. Let's just go.

19:20.572 --> 19:24.065
<i>Yep, we both had to admit,</i>
<i>Brick's special day was a bust.</i>

19:24.185 --> 19:26.169
(Thud) <i>We'd have to find a way
to make it up to him later.</i>

19:26.290 --> 19:28.002
Hey. What do you think
you're doing?

19:28.127 --> 19:30.015
- What?
(Mike) - Pick that up.

19:30.150 --> 19:31.818
I'll get it later.

19:32.651 --> 19:33.623
(Clears throat)

19:33.742 --> 19:35.678
Hey, don't talk back
to your father.

19:36.004 --> 19:37.572
I wasn't talking back.
I was--

19:37.684 --> 19:39.295
And don't talk back to me.

19:39.426 --> 19:41.837
You know, you are developing
a real attitude problem,

19:41.966 --> 19:43.101
and it's gonna stop.

19:43.230 --> 19:44.707
- But I--
- No "buts," Brick.

19:44.859 --> 19:45.893
We are sick of this.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.202
Now you better
start behaving yourself,

19:47.326 --> 19:48.711
or there's gonna be
a price to pay.

19:48.848 --> 19:50.193
In fact, get outta here.

19:50.350 --> 19:53.165
This conversation is over.
Go to your room.

19:54.563 --> 19:55.521
And stay there

19:55.650 --> 19:58.128
until you've thought about
what you've done!

20:04.397 --> 20:06.337
<i>So was</i>
<i>our experiment successful?</i>

20:06.542 --> 20:07.708
<i>I don't know.</i>

20:07.841 --> 20:09.513
<i>We did learn</i>
<i>something about Axl,</i>

20:09.646 --> 20:11.064
<i>sue learned something about me,</i>

20:11.217 --> 20:12.802
<i>and I learned</i>
<i>that I was buying shoes</i>

20:12.928 --> 20:14.887
<i>three sizes too small</i>
<i>for Brick.</i>

20:15.038 --> 20:16.224
(Brick) I wanna watch that!

20:16.355 --> 20:17.754
(Axl) Too bad, Brick!
Get your own remote!

20:19.697 --> 20:22.742
<i>I mean, sure we have chaos,
but chaos works for us.</i>

20:23.710 --> 20:24.830
We are done, right?

20:24.941 --> 20:26.989
There isn't a fourth
kid we forgot about, is there?

20:27.024 --> 20:28.955
We'll find out in the morning.
