WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:04.069
Let's do open discussion
before we wrap up.

00:04.100 --> 00:06.261
I have kind of a, uh,

00:06.300 --> 00:08.530
different topic in mind.

00:08.570 --> 00:12.176
Craziest thoughts
about your disease?

00:12.210 --> 00:13.438
You know what I mean.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.300
You know they're nuts,

00:15.340 --> 00:17.501
but they just keep popping
into your head aanay.

00:17.550 --> 00:21.008
I often wonder ifI should have
been born in another time.

00:21.750 --> 00:23.615
(clears throat)

00:23.650 --> 00:25.811
Sorry, my name is Sherlock,
and I'm an addict.

00:25.850 --> 00:27.511
ALL:
Hi, Sherlock.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.085
My-my...

00:30.130 --> 00:32.724
My senses are unusually--

00:32.760 --> 00:37.163
well, one could even say
unnaturally-- keen.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.065
(coughing)

00:39.100 --> 00:41.637
And ours is an era
of distraction.

00:41.670 --> 00:44.503
It's, uh, a punishing drumbeat

00:44.540 --> 00:47.407
of constant input.

00:47.440 --> 00:50.375
This-this cacophony

00:50.410 --> 00:53.208
which follows us into our homes

00:53.250 --> 00:55.309
and into our beds

00:55.350 --> 00:58.842
and seeps into our...

00:58.890 --> 01:00.858
into our souls,

01:00.890 --> 01:03.279
for want of a better word.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.397
For a long time, uh,

01:08.430 --> 01:11.399
there was only one poultice
for my raw nerve endings,

01:11.430 --> 01:14.831
and that was,
uh, copious drug use.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.237
So in my less
productive moments,

01:19.280 --> 01:21.669
I'm given to wonder...

01:25.350 --> 01:27.875
...if I'd just been born
when it was a little...

01:27.920 --> 01:31.447
quieter out there,

01:31.490 --> 01:35.312
would I have even become
an addict in the first place?

01:38.860 --> 01:42.364
Might I have been more focused?

01:44.800 --> 01:48.133
A more fully realized person?

01:48.170 --> 01:50.331
What, like Ancient Greece?

01:50.370 --> 01:51.769
You any idea what passed

01:51.810 --> 01:53.471
_ for dental _care
In the Hellenic era?

01:55.580 --> 01:57.775
No, no, I'd, um,

01:57.810 --> 02:01.416
I'd want some of the wonders
of modernity.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.553
Just before everything got...

02:07.590 --> 02:09.353
amplified.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.527
MAN:
Something like what?

02:10.560 --> 02:12.755
200 years ago?

02:16.200 --> 02:17.895
Mycroft.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.239
_ Web site said _
It was an open meeting.

02:20.270 --> 02:23.569
I came to support my brother,
so please go on.

02:23.610 --> 02:24.736
It's-it's fascinating.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.601
No. I, uh,

02:26.640 --> 02:29.245
I-I'm so sorry.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.271
Sorry.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.709
Hey, you leaving early?

02:36.750 --> 02:39.412
Did you really mean
what you said in there

02:39.460 --> 02:40.882
or were you just
winding them up?

02:40.920 --> 02:42.888
Mycroft.
I wouldn't have said
anything at all

02:42.930 --> 02:44.818
if I'd known the meeting
was compromised.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.249
Explain yourself!
Your maid told me
you'd gone out.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.949
I wheedled her a bit
to find out where.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.491
You live in England!
Did you know they've invented

02:51.530 --> 02:54.397
a flying conveyance capable
of hurtling its passengers

02:54.440 --> 02:55.668
vast distances.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.236
Ha.
Joan, delighted to see you.

02:57.270 --> 02:58.567
Oh, sorry.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.976
(chuckles)
Oh, dear.

03:01.010 --> 03:02.568
Um, so what are you doing
in New York?

03:02.610 --> 03:04.271
I planned to fly out next month.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.470
We're opening a branch

03:05.510 --> 03:06.977
of my restaurant Diogenes
in Tribeca.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.544
I intended to give you

03:08.580 --> 03:09.842
plenty of warning, of course,

03:09.890 --> 03:11.881
but, um, circumstances
brought me here earlier.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.785
Circumstances?

03:13.820 --> 03:14.582
Yes, a good friend of ours

03:14.620 --> 03:16.383
is in a bit of trouble,
Sherlock.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.250
We haven't got any
mutual friends.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.326
Acquaintance, then, might be
a better way of putting it.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.793
I'd like to explain it to you

03:21.830 --> 03:24.424
over dinner.
Oh.

03:26.970 --> 03:28.437
So we're planning on taking

03:28.470 --> 03:29.903
a couple of reservations
a night.

03:29.940 --> 03:31.737
The rest we'll fill
with walk-ins.

03:31.770 --> 03:34.409
I want the place
to be spontaneous, playful.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.443
Qualities you'll no doubt be
charging through the nose for.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.640
Oh, I think it's breathtaking.

03:38.680 --> 03:39.977
Thank you.
Once we've set the menu,

03:40.020 --> 03:41.817
we should be open
in a couple of weeks.

03:41.850 --> 03:42.782
I'm meeting with a couple

03:42.820 --> 03:44.242
of young chefs while I'm here.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.758
I want to find a new voice.

03:46.790 --> 03:48.849
Of course.

03:48.890 --> 03:51.427
"Old acquaintance"?

03:51.460 --> 03:53.451
Are you joking?

03:53.500 --> 03:54.751
Yes, well,
I thought it best explained

03:54.800 --> 03:57.360
by herself.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.369
Sherlock Holmes,
you look dashing as ever.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.907
Do let me know when you decide
to start aging, won't you?

04:08.810 --> 04:10.971
Well, I wasn't told
you'd be here.
Oh.

04:12.550 --> 04:15.371
Joan Watson, this
is Nigella Mason.

04:15.420 --> 04:16.785
She's my brother's
former fiance.

04:16.820 --> 04:18.515
Oh. Oh.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.313
It's nice to meet you.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.884
Lovely to meet you.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.922
Shall we?
Yes.

04:26.090 --> 04:27.648
WATSON:
I'm confused.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.520
Didn't you and your
brother's fiance...

04:29.570 --> 04:31.788
What? Copulate?

04:31.830 --> 04:34.435
Engage in several bouts
of vigorous sex?

04:34.470 --> 04:37.530
Yes, yes, we did.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.919
The plates are designed
to be shared,

05:02.970 --> 05:04.369
but pace yourself, okay?

05:04.400 --> 05:06.539
I've got a lot
of food back there.

05:06.570 --> 05:08.891
I know we're not serving
alcohol today.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.737
Are there any other
dietary restrictions?

05:10.770 --> 05:12.772
I lose my appetite

05:12.810 --> 05:14.835
in the company
of social-climbing trollops.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.904
WATSON:
Uh, no.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.441
Thank you, we're fine.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.368
NIGELLA:
I realize there's been

05:19.420 --> 05:20.944
some awkwardness
between the three of us.

05:20.980 --> 05:23.414
I seduced you within
weeks of your wedding

05:23.450 --> 05:25.509
and exposed your true
character to Mycroft.

05:25.550 --> 05:28.018
I cannot imagine how you've
managed to worm your way

05:28.060 --> 05:29.755
back into his life.

05:29.790 --> 05:31.826
It's complicated, Sherlock.

05:31.860 --> 05:34.658
A year after my difficulties

05:34.700 --> 05:37.669
with Mycroft, I fell in
love with and married

05:37.700 --> 05:39.793
a man by the name
of Robert Suffolk.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.092
He's also known by his title,

05:42.140 --> 05:43.960
the Marquess of Loudwater.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.136
"Marquess"?

05:45.170 --> 05:46.637
It's mid-level nobility.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.500
It's smack between
an earl and a duke.

05:48.540 --> 05:50.542
Oh, so that makes you a, um...

05:50.580 --> 05:52.104
Marchioness of Loudwater, yes.

05:52.150 --> 05:55.517
I retain my title though
I no longer retain my husband.

05:55.550 --> 05:57.541
The marquess turned out

05:57.590 --> 05:59.581
to be not as advertised.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.508
Not terribly interested
in holding up

06:01.560 --> 06:03.858
his end of the conjugal side,
if you follow.

06:03.890 --> 06:05.881
So...

06:05.930 --> 06:08.854
I turned, in my loneliness,
to Dalton,

06:08.900 --> 06:11.721
the man in charge of Robert's
stable of racehorses.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.499
I won't bore you
with the details,

06:13.540 --> 06:16.566
but private investigators
were hired,

06:16.610 --> 06:19.602
photographs were taken,
and the usual ugliness ensued.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.574
Do you see, finally,

06:21.610 --> 06:23.749
the magnitude of the
favor that I did you?

06:23.780 --> 06:26.146
While Robert
and I were courting,

06:28.980 --> 06:31.448
a champion stallion
named Silver Blaze,

06:31.490 --> 06:34.709
and thanks to the crafty work
of my lawyers,

06:34.760 --> 06:37.479
I came out of my marriage
with my title

06:37.530 --> 06:39.122
and ownership
of Silver Blaze.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.628
Now, he can't race anymore,
you understand.

06:41.660 --> 06:43.469
He's too old,

06:43.500 --> 06:46.663
but there is a thriving demand
for his studly services.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.588
So you've become a horse pimp?

06:48.640 --> 06:50.107
How fitting. Must be lucrative.

06:50.140 --> 06:53.906
Silver Blaze is being stabled
in Ulster County at the moment.

06:53.940 --> 06:55.908
The other night,

06:55.940 --> 06:57.544
Dalton was coming
to the stables

06:57.580 --> 07:00.469
to give the animal
his usual medication.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.739
He had a friend in the car,
and according to him,

07:03.790 --> 07:06.816
Dalton came upon a man who was
trying to break in the stables.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.987
Dalton confronted the burglar,

07:09.020 --> 07:10.851
and the man shot him.

07:10.890 --> 07:12.187
He died at the scene.

07:12.230 --> 07:13.697
I'm so sorry.

07:13.730 --> 07:14.697
Thank you.

07:14.730 --> 07:16.618
It's been awful.

07:16.670 --> 07:17.989
When the murderer fled,

07:18.030 --> 07:20.237
he left behind
a bag of supplies.

07:20.270 --> 07:22.864
The police found a syringe full

07:22.910 --> 07:24.764
of concentrated potassium,

07:24.810 --> 07:26.732
and they believe
that Dalton's killer

07:26.780 --> 07:29.476
intended to poison Silver Blaze.

07:29.510 --> 07:31.944
So you want us to find him
and protect your meal ticket?

07:31.980 --> 07:34.642
And get justice for Dalton.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.580
Look, I realize that I've made
some mistakes in my life,

07:36.620 --> 07:38.542
but I _have made efforts
to Improve myself,

07:38.590 --> 07:40.114
and when Mycroft fell sick,

07:40.160 --> 07:42.082
he found a way
to forgive me.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.656
Uh, Nigella, please.

07:43.690 --> 07:45.749
And I believe
that you can do the same.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.569
Oh, you didn't realize
that Mycroft was sick?

07:50.600 --> 07:52.966
Spot of leukemia.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.729
Bone marrow transplant.

07:54.770 --> 07:56.192
I'm better now.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.060
I tried to find different ways
to tell you.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.634
It just never happened.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.604
I'm sincerely sorry
for your troubles.

08:06.150 --> 08:07.674
But...

08:07.720 --> 08:11.178
this is an awful,
toxic creature.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.518
Fortunately, I don't need
to sleep with her again

08:13.560 --> 08:15.881
to get her out of my life,
I just need to leave.

08:17.690 --> 08:19.692
Marchioness.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.765
(indistinct radio transmission)

08:26.670 --> 08:28.535
Looking for
something to solve?

08:30.170 --> 08:31.967
My brother
makes you uncomfortable.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.308
Your posture stiffens subtly
whenever he gets close.

08:34.340 --> 08:36.672
I'm pretty sure it doesn't.
I suspected

08:36.710 --> 08:39.247
he would try to sleep with you
while we were in London,

08:39.280 --> 08:41.077
Is that what happened?
No.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.678
Were his advances ungentlemanly
in some way?

08:42.720 --> 08:44.210
There were no advances,
and I can't believe

08:44.250 --> 08:45.786
that's what
you want to talk about.

08:45.820 --> 08:46.809
Your brother had leukemia,

08:46.860 --> 08:49.249
and he didn't tell you
about it.

08:49.290 --> 08:51.326
I know if that happened to me,
I would be hurt

08:51.360 --> 08:53.225
and furious and sad and worried.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.322
I feel annoyed.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.598
Annoyed?

08:58.630 --> 09:00.166
Profoundly.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.667
Of course Mycroft's
spiritual awakening

09:01.700 --> 09:03.634
is tied to some sort of illness.

09:03.670 --> 09:05.228
The man has never met a clich

09:05.270 --> 09:06.828
he didn't have
a head-on collision with.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.678
(doorbell ringing)

09:09.710 --> 09:11.701
(sighs)

09:20.990 --> 09:22.855
Hello.

09:22.890 --> 09:24.755
I know it's late; I'm sorry.

09:26.860 --> 09:28.851
(door closes)

09:33.840 --> 09:35.831
Pleasant.

09:39.140 --> 09:40.698
I owe you an apology.

09:40.740 --> 09:42.105
Obviously, I should've told you.

09:42.140 --> 09:44.005
You needed bone marrow.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.769
A sibling is
the most likely match by far.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.684
I'm trying
to be less stubborn now.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.382
I think... I hope my illness

09:53.420 --> 09:54.956
has made me
a more compassnonate,

09:54.990 --> 09:56.821
better person.
Well, of course you do.

09:56.860 --> 09:58.054
You're following
the same narrative

09:58.090 --> 10:00.058
all venal people do
when they get sick.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.852
A lot of people may go
through the same thing,

10:01.900 --> 10:03.697
but it doesn't make it
less real.

10:03.730 --> 10:05.129
It's like an addiction
in that sense,

10:05.170 --> 10:06.762
I'd imagine.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.290
You asked how Nigella

10:08.340 --> 10:10.706
got back into my life.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.332
When I was diagnosed,

10:12.370 --> 10:13.974
she got in touch,

10:14.010 --> 10:16.672
asked if there was anything
she could do to help.

10:16.710 --> 10:19.008
When she learned I was looking
for a bone marrow donor,

10:19.050 --> 10:20.915
she organized a drive
to find one.

10:20.950 --> 10:23.817
Turned it into a cause,
got the whole posh crowd

10:23.850 --> 10:26.148
she was running
around with involved.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.852
I found my match because of her.

10:28.890 --> 10:30.323
One good turn deserves another.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.794
Yes, I suppose it does.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.320
In any case, I don't think

10:34.360 --> 10:36.055
this is about the quality
of Nigella's character.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.920
I think this is
about you and me.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.699
If we help her,
it will prove tangibly

10:42.740 --> 10:44.662
that we've put
this whole thing behind us.

10:46.740 --> 10:48.332
Or if you're still
feeling stubborn,

10:48.380 --> 10:51.406
you can just tell yourself
it's about solving a murder.

10:53.950 --> 10:56.817
So, Detective Bell said
two NYPD consultants

10:56.850 --> 10:58.078
would be coming out.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.281
Two did; we brought
a restaurateur with us.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.925
He also said
you'd be moving Silver Blaze

11:02.960 --> 11:04.279
to the NYPD stables?

11:04.330 --> 11:05.979
Yes, it seems the best way
to safeguard

11:06.030 --> 11:07.952
against further
possible attacks.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.319
So what happened here?

11:09.360 --> 11:11.089
Be thorough.

11:11.130 --> 11:13.792
Well, Dalton Ladd
parked his car there.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.193
He'd been out for a drink
with his friend Asa,

11:15.240 --> 11:16.867
who waited in the car

11:16.910 --> 11:19.708
while Mr. Ladd went
to give the horse his shot.

11:19.740 --> 11:22.208
He came upon a guy
trying to pick the lock.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.447
Asa said he was about
six feet tall,

11:24.480 --> 11:26.744
but he couldn't
see much more than that.

11:26.780 --> 11:28.839
Guy fires twice, he takes off
and he leaves his bag.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.144
Now, the owner had been
getting ready for bed.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.158
He heard the gunshots.

11:33.190 --> 11:34.885
He comes out with a shotgun,

11:34.920 --> 11:36.888
but, by that time,
the killer

11:36.930 --> 11:38.818
had reached
that tree line.

11:38.860 --> 11:40.350
Were there any
prints on the lock?

11:40.400 --> 11:41.856
Yeah. Too many.

11:41.900 --> 11:44.027
People are in and out of here
all the time,

11:44.070 --> 11:45.469
so no prints of value.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.968
So, did the owner
pursue the gunman?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.297
Yeah.

11:49.340 --> 11:50.864
Stayed on him for
about a quarter mile,

11:50.910 --> 11:52.775
till he reached
a clearing in the woods.

11:52.810 --> 11:54.801
But when he got there,
the guy was just gone.

11:56.810 --> 11:57.879
Sorry, it'd be bet...
could you just

11:57.910 --> 11:59.207
stay out of the eye line here?

11:59.250 --> 12:01.138
You're joking.
I was just standing here.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.408
Yes, that's the problem.

12:02.450 --> 12:04.884
Oh, could you show
us the clearing?

12:06.150 --> 12:08.880
So, like I said,
the owner chased him this far.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.979
But when he got here,
the guy was just gone.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.918
How much of a lead
did the gunman have?

12:12.960 --> 12:15.758
Well, the owner says he was
about a hundred yards behind.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.859
I know-- there's no way
that the gunman

12:17.900 --> 12:19.936
would've had time to make it
clear across the field.

12:19.970 --> 12:21.767
But I figure...

12:21.800 --> 12:24.303
the owner was further back from
the gunman than he thought.

12:24.340 --> 12:26.069
Yes, that's one possible
explanation.

12:26.110 --> 12:27.475
Another possible explanation

12:27.510 --> 12:28.932
is that he didn't
disappear at all,

12:28.980 --> 12:30.345
he just took
to higher ground,

12:30.380 --> 12:32.348
to see how many people
were following him

12:32.380 --> 12:34.416
and then planned
his escape.

12:34.450 --> 12:36.987
These trees are over
a hundred years old.

12:37.020 --> 12:38.089
There's no low-hanging branches.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.849
But this young oak
would work.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.384
He would have to hoist
himself up, off that branch.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.921
Yes, which means
he had to grab it.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.091
Right.

12:50.130 --> 12:52.394
Fortunately,
the bark is smooth

12:52.430 --> 12:54.364
on top.

13:17.860 --> 13:18.986
There.

13:19.030 --> 13:21.055
(camera clicks)

13:22.560 --> 13:25.199
I'll wager these are the
fingerprints of our murderer.

13:26.570 --> 13:28.834
There's one missing.

13:28.870 --> 13:30.406
The man we're looking for

13:30.440 --> 13:33.034
is missing the ring finger
from his left hand.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.537
Should we see if he's
been arrested before?

13:38.910 --> 13:41.049
Right. Let's see what
a would-be horse assassin

13:41.080 --> 13:42.547
brings on his rounds,
shall we?

13:44.090 --> 13:45.580
Mycroft,
if you'd like to be useful

13:45.620 --> 13:47.212
as something other
than a means of transportation,

13:47.260 --> 13:48.454
feel free to take notes.

13:48.490 --> 13:50.082
That policeman in Ulster County

13:50.130 --> 13:52.382
said we could look in the bag,
not take it away.

13:52.430 --> 13:54.250
Yes, well, I find it
best not to ask.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.858
They can get
quite territorial

13:55.900 --> 13:57.561
when you say you want
to take evidence with you.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.932
They certainly weren't using
it to solve any crimes.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.635
Two sets of lock picks...

14:03.670 --> 14:07.106
one very large knife...

14:07.140 --> 14:09.438
three syringes
bundled in duct tape

14:09.480 --> 14:11.402
and one map of Ulster County.

14:16.380 --> 14:18.848
Map has pin impressions on it.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.152
WATSON:
2501.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.656
Maybe an address?

14:29.700 --> 14:31.065
HOLMES:
Not a useful one.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.668
BELL: You guys are
swimming in some
deep water here.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.964
There's a_hit
on your prInts,

14:37.010 --> 14:39.934
but it's not to a person,
it's to a crime.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.379
A series of crimes,
actually.

14:41.410 --> 14:43.048
The index fingerprint you found

14:43.080 --> 14:44.206
matches partials
that were found

14:44.250 --> 14:45.649
at the site of 13 murders.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.511
What?!

14:47.550 --> 14:49.518
They happened
in two batches.

14:49.550 --> 14:51.017
Two mass shootings
the DEA thinks

14:51.050 --> 14:52.915
are tied to a war
between the Robles cartel

14:52.960 --> 14:54.655
and a couple lieutenants

14:54.690 --> 14:56.920
who tried to go into
business for themselves.

14:56.960 --> 14:59.952
In both cases, they believe
the shooter is a Robles assassin

15:00.000 --> 15:01.627
nicknamed "El Mechanico."

15:01.660 --> 15:04.094
Would you get in touch
with the Marchioness?

15:04.130 --> 15:05.392
I would very much like
to ask her

15:05.430 --> 15:06.692
why drug dealers want
to murder her horse.

15:06.730 --> 15:08.960
What else do we know about
this El Mechanico?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.558
BELL:
Not much.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.329
This first massacre happened
at a dock in Tampa.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.608
There was a civilian
cleaning his boat

15:14.640 --> 15:16.676
when the shots started flying.

15:16.710 --> 15:18.143
He gave a description but...

15:18.180 --> 15:20.671
(phone chiming)
no one's seen him since.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.416
Nigella says we can
see her at her hotel.

15:23.450 --> 15:24.610
She's at the Sutner.

15:24.650 --> 15:27.153
Suite 2501.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.320
(distant siren wailing,
car horns honking)

15:50.580 --> 15:53.219
(phone ringing)

15:59.020 --> 16:00.282
Hello?

16:00.320 --> 16:02.311
Nigella, listen
very carefully:

16:02.360 --> 16:04.021
The same man who
killed Dalton Ladd

16:04.060 --> 16:05.084
is targeting you.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.722
NIGELLA:
What?!

16:06.760 --> 16:08.296
Have you noticed
anyone unusual?

16:08.330 --> 16:10.366
Any deliveries
to your room?

16:10.400 --> 16:11.992
No, no, no.

16:12.030 --> 16:13.133
It's been quite peaceful,
actually.

16:13.170 --> 16:14.262
I've just been enjoying
the view.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.733
Your curtains are open?

16:15.770 --> 16:17.465
NIGELLA:
Yeah, just the one.

16:18.810 --> 16:21.370
Would you kindly go into
another room at once?

16:21.410 --> 16:22.707
Why?

16:22.740 --> 16:23.741
(silenced gunshot)

16:28.820 --> 16:30.310
For God sakes, of course

16:30.350 --> 16:32.284
I don't know anybody
in the Robles cartel.

16:32.320 --> 16:35.357
I'm in the peerage.

16:35.390 --> 16:38.689
And I don't understand
why they'd want me dead.

16:38.730 --> 16:40.698
I have no idea whatsoever.

16:40.730 --> 16:42.322
All right, what about
your boyfriend?

16:42.360 --> 16:45.261
You think it's possible he did
business with them and...

16:45.300 --> 16:47.188
hid it from you?
Dalton was an alternate

16:47.240 --> 16:51.131
on the national steeplechase
team in 2000 and 2004.

16:51.170 --> 16:52.637
That's her way of saying no.

16:52.670 --> 16:54.308
What about your
other employees?

16:54.340 --> 16:56.171
She's lying.

16:56.210 --> 16:59.099
I know Miss Mason to be
a woman of low character.

16:59.150 --> 17:00.515
You've incurred
the wrath of these people,

17:00.550 --> 17:02.768
and it wasn't through
an honest difference of opinion.

17:02.820 --> 17:06.381
I will give you access
to all of our books,

17:06.420 --> 17:09.389
records, anything--
but there is no connection

17:09.420 --> 17:12.150
_ between these
Vile people and me.

17:17.230 --> 17:18.162
What's this?

17:18.200 --> 17:20.088
I spent most of the day
as a spare wheel.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.630
I thought I'd make
myself useful.

17:21.670 --> 17:24.537
I know you and Joan rarely
sit down for a meal.

17:24.570 --> 17:26.731
That's by design--
a lingering dinner,

17:26.770 --> 17:28.704
especially in the midst of
a case, is an indulgence.

17:28.740 --> 17:31.277
You think conversation's
an indulgence?

17:31.310 --> 17:32.709
_The meal itself
is an indulgence.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.638
_ Conversation
is an annoyance

17:34.680 --> 17:36.409
within an indulgence...

17:39.750 --> 17:41.354
Well, I suppose
it's harmless enough.

17:41.390 --> 17:43.585
As long as you don't try
to stop me from working.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.120
You're welcome.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.196
So...

17:47.230 --> 17:49.824
did you learn anything?

17:49.860 --> 17:53.364
The police believe a man
named Joaquin Aguilar

17:53.400 --> 17:56.767
heads up the Robles cartel's
East Coast operations.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.405
The cartel is always at odds
with one or another

17:59.440 --> 18:01.601
of its rivals, so the man is
very rarely seen in public.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.540
In fact,
he's only been spotted six times

18:03.580 --> 18:05.707
in the last two years.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.377
He's always at a private box
he maintains

18:07.420 --> 18:09.445
at the Aqueduct
race track.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.516
He's a _horseman.
A pa55ionate one.

18:11.550 --> 18:13.609
There's bad behavior
to be unearthed here.

18:13.660 --> 18:14.684
Be prepared for that.

18:16.490 --> 18:17.650
You seem quite invested

18:17.690 --> 18:19.624
in the idea
that Nigella has changed.

18:19.660 --> 18:22.151
From what I can see,
change is sloppy.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.622
It's a process,
not an absolute state.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.467
Why are you so
invested

18:25.500 --> 18:26.762
in the idea
that Nigella has to be

18:26.800 --> 18:28.336
a good person
to deserve your help?

18:28.370 --> 18:30.361
What are you doing?

18:30.410 --> 18:31.866
Something has just
occurred to me.

18:31.910 --> 18:34.105
Mmm!

18:36.340 --> 18:37.671
This is the best risotto
I have ever had.

18:37.710 --> 18:39.371
(clears throat)

18:39.410 --> 18:41.241
Why are you hiring a chef?
You should do it.

18:41.280 --> 18:44.147
Owning restaurants
is a lot more fun.
Mm.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.646
He means less work.

18:45.690 --> 18:47.715
Yes, I suppose
you could say that.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.682
I don't quite believe

18:49.720 --> 18:51.153
I'm going to say this
to a grown man:

18:51.190 --> 18:52.452
Your food's getting cold.

18:57.730 --> 18:59.220
(phone chimes)

19:02.700 --> 19:04.668
Brilliant.

19:04.710 --> 19:05.768
I've just heard back from
a forensic accountant

19:05.810 --> 19:07.630
I once helped
out of a spot of bother

19:07.680 --> 19:09.830
involving a naked self-portrait
of himself-- anyway--

19:09.880 --> 19:12.508
he's confirmed something
I already suspected.

19:12.550 --> 19:15.269
I noticed that Joaquin Aguilar

19:15.320 --> 19:18.687
comes to the race track when
one of two horses is racmg--

19:18.720 --> 19:21.280
both animals are owned by
Mariotti Farms,

19:21.320 --> 19:24.323
it's a stable and training
facility in New Jersey.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.453
Mariotti Farms,
I've just learned,

19:26.490 --> 19:28.526
received its initial seed money

19:28.560 --> 19:30.266
from a limited liability
corporation

19:30.300 --> 19:31.892
with substantial holdings
in manganese mining

19:31.930 --> 19:33.591
and canned foods.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.198
The corporation has,
three times,

19:35.240 --> 19:37.367
been investigated
by the DEA,

19:37.410 --> 19:40.436
who have long suspected
it is a front for...

19:40.480 --> 19:42.209
the Robles cartel.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.777
You think Joaquin Aguilar

19:44.810 --> 19:46.539
is the real money
behind those horses?

19:46.580 --> 19:47.740
It's called shadow ownership.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.714
Happens all the time
in racing.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.479
Look at this...
(paper rustling)

19:52.950 --> 19:56.556
This is a list of all the horses
owned by Mariotti Farms,

19:56.590 --> 19:57.921
this...

19:57.960 --> 20:00.997
is a list of all Silver Blaze's
sexual partners

20:01.030 --> 20:03.567
since the Marchioness began
pimping him out.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.921
"Twice for No"
is on both these lists.

20:05.970 --> 20:09.360
Joaquin Aguilar paid to have
one of his mares impregnated

20:09.400 --> 20:13.370
by Silver Blaze--
I need Nigella's records.

20:18.850 --> 20:20.977
The pairing alleged to a male
offspring, born healthy,

20:21.020 --> 20:23.887
who was then sold... to...

20:23.920 --> 20:25.785
a third party.

20:25.820 --> 20:27.412
WATSON:
That's weird.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.018
He paid for a champion
to impregnate his horse.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.550
Why would he just
sell off the baby?

20:30.590 --> 20:31.955
HOLMES:
It is curious.

20:31.990 --> 20:34.891
The foal is housed
at a stables in Long Island,

20:34.930 --> 20:36.727
so I say we go and have a look.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.728
But not till_
the morning, right?

20:38.770 --> 20:41.534
So does this mean that
you can actually Sit down

20:41.570 --> 20:42.889
and have some dessert?

20:42.940 --> 20:43.964
Hmm?

20:51.980 --> 20:52.844
Excellent.

20:54.050 --> 20:55.449
(clears throat)

20:56.780 --> 20:57.883
Ah, sorry, I can't do this.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.547
There's just too much tension.

20:59.590 --> 21:01.012
What are you talking about?
There's no tension.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.687
We're having
a nice time.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.358
You must be joking.
Watson carries unease

21:04.390 --> 21:05.823
between her shoulder blades.
Her trape2ius muscles

21:05.860 --> 21:06.986
are in knots,
and it's carrying over

21:07.030 --> 21:08.918
to her deltoids.
My back is fine.

21:08.960 --> 21:11.929
What happened
between you two in London?

21:11.970 --> 21:13.790
(sighs heavily)

21:13.840 --> 21:15.933
I'm not so sure

21:15.970 --> 21:18.063
this is a good idea.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.805
Thank you for
your company.

21:23.910 --> 21:25.798
(door opens, closes)
What is the matter with you?

21:25.850 --> 21:26.839
Your brother is
reaching out to you.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.472
You guys have a chance

21:28.520 --> 21:30.385
to fix things,
and you're wasting it.

21:30.420 --> 21:31.648
I'm not wrong, though.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.089
You're _uncomfortable
in his presence.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.849
I am not uncomfortable
around Mycroft.

21:34.890 --> 21:36.949
I am uncomfortable around you
and Mycroft together.

21:36.990 --> 21:38.548
For what reason?

21:38.590 --> 21:39.784
This is none of your business.

21:39.830 --> 21:40.854
But you're being weird

21:40.900 --> 21:42.629
and I don't
want you to wreck

21:42.660 --> 21:44.093
your relationship with
your brother-- again.

21:44.130 --> 21:46.621
Okay, we had dinner...
I was a little bit nervous

21:46.670 --> 21:48.638
because I thought he was
gonna hit on me,

21:48.670 --> 21:50.900
but it became obvious
that he just wanted
to talk about you.

21:50.940 --> 21:52.908
He was Sincere and sweet

21:52.940 --> 21:54.737
and he's funny, too.
Oh, my God.

21:54.780 --> 21:56.702
I was in London-- I didn't know
he was gonna come here.

21:56.740 --> 21:58.879
You had sex with my brother.

21:58.910 --> 22:00.741
Willingly?

22:00.780 --> 22:02.839
Great-- you had to push,
so now you know.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.586
Two consenting adults
went to bed together.

22:04.620 --> 22:06.042
Okay?
You can let that

22:06.090 --> 22:07.910
ruin your relationship
with your brother, or not.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.951
Your call.

22:18.900 --> 22:21.767
Watson, I've decided not to hold
your dalliance against you.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.506
As you said,
you're a grown woman.

22:25.510 --> 22:26.659
I'm disappointed in you.

22:26.710 --> 22:27.938
I thought you were attempting

22:27.980 --> 22:30.448
to move beyond
petty revenge tactics.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.744
It wasn't revenge.

22:32.780 --> 22:35.647
1-1 have just one question
for the both of you.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.443
Is this going to be
an ongoing arrangement?

22:37.490 --> 22:39.947
Because, if it is,
I'll need to plan accordingly.

22:43.490 --> 22:45.424
You haven't discussed it.

22:45.460 --> 22:47.155
Well, get it sorted
immediately, would you?

22:47.190 --> 22:48.851
It's the least you could do.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.922
Just out of curiosity--
was he any good?

22:51.970 --> 22:53.767
My brother.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.961
Does he have a talent
for the act of coitus?

22:58.710 --> 23:00.029
Mycroft, your thoughts
on Watson?

23:00.070 --> 23:01.537
WOMAN:
We were real surprised

23:01.580 --> 23:03.639
we even got a shot
to bid on a foal

23:03.680 --> 23:05.443
from Silver Blaze
and Twice for No.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.744
This little guy cost us big.

23:07.780 --> 23:10.988
Here he is-- Nutmeg.

23:11.020 --> 23:13.079
You pet him, you got
yourself a friend for life.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.758
Hi, Nutmeg.

23:14.790 --> 23:16.519
You mind
telling me why

23:16.560 --> 23:18.721
the NYPD's so keen
to see a baby horse?

23:18.760 --> 23:20.079
It's a winding tale.

23:20.130 --> 23:21.688
It_ i _nvolves
the British peerage,

23:21.730 --> 23:23.095
syringes full of
concentrated potassium

23:23.130 --> 23:25.894
and 13 drug-related
murders.

23:29.740 --> 23:32.538
WATSON:
You want to tell me what
we're looking at here?

23:32.570 --> 23:34.709
Whorls.
Whirls?

23:34.740 --> 23:36.435
Whorls-- small patches
of hair which grow

23:36.480 --> 23:38.607
in the opposite direction
to the rest of the coat.

23:38.650 --> 23:41.016
I'll only be a moment.

23:41.050 --> 23:42.711
If you can't
wait patiently,

23:42.750 --> 23:45.082
feel free to find something
to occupy your time.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.883
Have sex with my
brother, perhaps.

23:46.920 --> 23:47.887
(horse neighs)

23:47.920 --> 23:49.114
Well, it gives me absolutely

23:49.160 --> 23:50.718
no pleasure to say,
"I told you so,"

23:50.760 --> 23:52.489
but Nigella Mason
is a horrid witch.

23:52.530 --> 23:54.919
If it gives you no pleasure,
why you looking so satisfied?

23:54.960 --> 23:55.949
Because I know why

23:56.000 --> 23:58.093
Joaquin Aguilar
is angry with her.

23:58.130 --> 24:00.121
Summon the marchioness.

24:00.170 --> 24:01.592
Did you know
there have been

24:01.640 --> 24:03.665
several studies done
on whether or not

24:03.710 --> 24:06.907
the placement of whorls on
horses is a heritable trait?

24:06.940 --> 24:08.669
I beg your pardon?

24:08.710 --> 24:11.804
The placement of those little
cowlicks is inherited.

24:11.850 --> 24:14.068
And why are you
telling me this?

24:14.120 --> 24:16.145
Well, it's not something that
most people would look for,

24:16.180 --> 24:18.011
but appears to be true.

24:18.050 --> 24:19.813
I'll show you.

24:19.850 --> 24:22.557
(Holmes clears throat)

24:22.590 --> 24:24.057
This...
(clears throat)

24:24.090 --> 24:26.229
is a photograph
of Silver Blaze.

24:26.260 --> 24:28.057
You will observe

24:28.100 --> 24:30.660
there is a whorl directly
between his eyes.

24:30.700 --> 24:33.567
Mmm.
The same is true
of Twice for No,

24:33.600 --> 24:35.864
who recently birthed
Silver Blaze's son.

24:35.900 --> 24:38.164
Now, the laws of nature
tell us that their offspring

24:38.210 --> 24:40.701
should also have whorls
between his eyes.

24:40.740 --> 24:43.129
We looked at this young
beast this morning.

24:43.180 --> 24:48.208
Nutmeg has whorls positioned
well above his eyes.

24:48.250 --> 24:51.686
Which leads me to the
pertinent question:

24:51.720 --> 24:55.258
What exactly happened to
the real Silver Blaze?

24:55.290 --> 24:56.757
Is he dead?

24:56.790 --> 24:58.018
Dead?

24:58.060 --> 24:59.049
(chuckles)

24:59.090 --> 25:01.593
You saw him yourself yesterday.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.097
Well, I saw a horse
that certainly

25:03.130 --> 25:04.825
looked like
Silver Blaze.

25:04.870 --> 25:06.064
But you and I
both know

25:06.100 --> 25:07.965
that the horse
whose sexual favors

25:08.000 --> 25:10.230
you are selling for
upwards of 100,000 a pop

25:10.270 --> 25:12.659
is an imposter.

25:19.110 --> 25:21.169
You have no idea the battles
that I fought

25:21.220 --> 25:23.984
to get ownership of Silver Blaze

25:24.020 --> 25:27.217
included in my prenuptials
with the marquess.

25:27.250 --> 25:29.753
And why shouldn't I
have something to show

25:29.790 --> 25:32.224
for giving years of my life
to that man's lie?

25:32.260 --> 25:35.195
You were married
for 22 months.

25:35.230 --> 25:37.289
Yes, and I
earned that horse

25:37.330 --> 25:38.763
during that stretch--
believe me.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.267
I earned a pack of horses.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.564
And, of course,
it wasn't ten weeks

25:42.600 --> 25:44.136
after we signed
the papers

25:44.170 --> 25:46.559
that I get a call
out of the blue--

25:46.610 --> 25:48.339
3:00 a.m.,
heart failure.

25:48.380 --> 25:52.248
So you hatched a plan to
keep the money rolling in.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.248
Where did you find
the imposter?

25:54.280 --> 25:56.669
Silver Blaze has a brother.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.688
He never amounted to much.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.154
But their markings
are almost identical.

26:01.190 --> 26:03.852
We bought him
for a few hundred quid,

26:03.890 --> 26:05.926
applied a bit of hair dye
here and there.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.951
Dye?
You're charging these people

26:08.000 --> 26:09.854
hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

26:09.900 --> 26:12.164
Don't they want to have proof
that it's the real horse?

26:12.200 --> 26:13.224
Yes. Well,
the racing world's

26:13.270 --> 26:14.760
always been
a little bit backward.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.233
With studding,

26:16.270 --> 26:19.103
most of the scrutiny
falls on the mare.

26:19.140 --> 26:20.129
They're screened
for disease,

26:20.170 --> 26:22.172
for the tendency
to inflict injury

26:22.210 --> 26:23.234
during the live cover.

26:23.280 --> 26:24.838
And the stud, well,

26:24.880 --> 26:27.201
the whole world knew
that Silver Blaze was mine.

26:27.250 --> 26:30.788
There were some requests
for genetic testing.

26:30.820 --> 26:33.311
We took some hair
and some blood

26:33.350 --> 26:35.989
before we got rid
of the body.

26:36.020 --> 26:38.727
So, really, we didn't run
into that many problems.

26:38.760 --> 26:41.888
You're the first three people
who have figured it out.

26:41.930 --> 26:43.227
Actually, we're not.

26:43.260 --> 26:45.626
Joaquin Aguilar
caught on, too.

26:45.670 --> 26:48.059
_But he couldn't
just expose you.

26:48.100 --> 26:51.069
That would destroy the value
of the foal born to his mare.

26:51.110 --> 26:54.170
So he did what drug
kingpins are wont to do.

26:54.210 --> 26:56.872
He planned his revenge.

26:56.910 --> 26:58.207
Poisoned your horse.

26:58.250 --> 27:01.640
And after you watched it
die over several days,

27:01.680 --> 27:04.911
he would then come for
you and your consort.

27:04.950 --> 27:06.747
Dalton.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.327
Are you going to tell the police
what I've done?

27:15.130 --> 27:18.327
I see. I'm at the mercy
of the Holmes brothers.

27:19.830 --> 27:21.434
MAN:
I knew it was a drug deal.

27:21.470 --> 27:23.802
That's why I stayed hidden,

27:23.840 --> 27:26.138
even after I heard the gunshots.

27:26.170 --> 27:28.070
I heard men screaming.

27:28.110 --> 27:31.807
I got up to run, and I saw him.

27:31.850 --> 27:34.273
He was sitting there
like a statue.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.276
His eyes, I...

27:36.320 --> 27:38.083
I don't know.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.315
They were just cold.

27:40.350 --> 27:42.318
Like the Arctic.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.851
The only man to ever
lay eyes on El Mecanico

27:44.890 --> 27:46.949
has a weakness for
unhelpful metaphors.

27:50.260 --> 27:52.160
Are you still sulking
about Mycroft?

27:52.200 --> 27:53.428
No.

27:53.470 --> 27:56.166
I hope you don't expect
me to apologize.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.202
Look, ifI had a sister,
would you even hesitate

27:58.240 --> 27:59.832
for a second before
you slept With her?

27:59.870 --> 28:01.770
It's not the act itself
that gives me pause.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.300
It's that I can't
put it into context.

28:04.880 --> 28:08.338
There is_a certain...
intimacy

28:08.380 --> 28:11.281
which is a byproduct
of our partnership.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.015
We work well
together,

28:13.050 --> 28:14.915
and I think we both
value that fact.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.313
Right?

28:16.360 --> 28:18.419
You must have known
that I would deduce

28:18.460 --> 28:20.325
that you had slept
with my brother.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.424
It is unlike you
to introduce such a free radical

28:24.470 --> 28:27.962
_ into an otherwise _
highly functional relationship.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.059
Unless, of course,
the unlikelihood

28:30.100 --> 28:32.967
was precisely
the point.

28:33.010 --> 28:35.308
Do you think you're maybe
overthinking this?

28:35.340 --> 28:37.376
You wanted to demonstrate
that I don't have

28:37.410 --> 28:39.344
a monopoly on boorish
or outrageous behavior.

28:39.380 --> 28:42.076
That you won't become
a slave to the roles

28:42.120 --> 28:44.042
we have assigned
each other.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.443
Hmm.

28:45.490 --> 28:48.118
I'm glad we cleared the air.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.912
Message received.

28:49.960 --> 28:51.427
There was no message.

28:51.460 --> 28:52.950
(sighs)

28:52.990 --> 28:54.924
Does that man's reliance
on hazy metaphor

28:54.960 --> 28:56.325
seem almost willful to you?

28:56.360 --> 28:58.328
What do you mean?

29:00.940 --> 29:03.238
I guess I thought
he looked like...

29:03.270 --> 29:06.307
Vengeance.

29:06.340 --> 29:08.308
MAN 2 (over video):
Vengeance. Okay.

29:08.340 --> 29:11.446
He's selling an idea,
not describing a person.

29:14.180 --> 29:17.479
I guess I thought
he looked like...

29:17.520 --> 29:19.408
Vengeance.

29:19.450 --> 29:21.156
Vengeance. Okay.

29:21.190 --> 29:23.385
Can you be
more specific?

29:27.360 --> 29:29.089
You're a crafty cow, aren't you?

29:29.130 --> 29:31.189
Look at his hand.

29:33.070 --> 29:35.197
He's missing his ring finger.

29:35.240 --> 29:38.334
As is the man who murdered
Dalton Ladd the other night.

29:38.370 --> 29:41.203
I don't think we're looking
at the witness to a massacre.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.970
I think he's the perpetrator.

29:45.280 --> 29:47.009
That's El Mecanico.

29:47.050 --> 29:49.848
GREGSON:
This is the guy
the Feds have been

29:49.880 --> 29:51.211
chasing for years?

29:51.250 --> 29:52.547
If that's true,
why did he even bother

29:52.590 --> 29:53.909
giving this statement?

29:53.960 --> 29:55.086
We think that
the police

29:55.120 --> 29:56.348
got to the scene
of the massacre

29:56.390 --> 29:57.516
before he could
get away.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.380
He had to come up
with a cover story.

29:59.430 --> 30:02.092
We're dealing with an
exceptionally cunning opponent.

30:02.130 --> 30:03.961
He'd have to have
this identity

30:04.000 --> 30:06.059
in place as
a fail-safe.

30:06.100 --> 30:08.239
Once the authorities
arrived, he crafted a tale

30:08.270 --> 30:10.363
that took advantage of
everyone's preconceived notions

30:10.400 --> 30:12.402
of what a cartel hit man
should look like.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.601
He sent the DEA
hunting for a myth.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.437
And no one noticed
that the guy's

30:16.480 --> 30:18.141
missing a finger
on his left hand?

30:18.180 --> 30:21.377
They've been working off
of partial fingerprints.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.411
No one knew that they were
pursuing a four-fingered man

30:23.450 --> 30:25.088
until we found _
a complete set of prints

30:25.120 --> 30:27.441
at the scene of
Dalton Ladd's murder.

30:27.490 --> 30:29.117
That's him.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.981
We're about to
apprehend El Mecanico.

30:32.030 --> 30:33.554
Well, let's say you're right.

30:33.590 --> 30:36.491
This guy told the Feds his name
was Kent Jenkins.

30:36.530 --> 30:37.929
I'm guessing that's an alias.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.392
All right, so we know

30:39.430 --> 30:41.432
what he looks like--
that's more than we had--

30:41.470 --> 30:44.928
but I don't see how we're
about to put cuffs on the guy.

30:44.970 --> 30:48.872
We know what he looks like,
and we know what he wants.

30:50.180 --> 30:52.501
El Mecanico is nothing
if not thorough.

30:52.550 --> 30:54.643
He was contracted to
kill Nigella Mason.

30:54.680 --> 30:57.240
Rest assured he's going to
try and do exactly that.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.544
We don't use civilians as bait.

30:59.590 --> 31:02.479
There's no need to put her
directly in his crosshairs.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.158
No.

31:04.190 --> 31:05.521
There's no doubt he's
monitoring her movements.

31:05.560 --> 31:07.425
One of the simplest ways
to do that

31:07.460 --> 31:08.996
is listen in on _
her phone conversations.

31:09.030 --> 31:11.169
Anyone with 50
pounds to spend

31:11.200 --> 31:12.565
can buy the software
which lets them

31:12.600 --> 31:14.534
listen in on virtually
any wireless call.

31:14.570 --> 31:17.391
That's why we told her
not to use her cell.
Yeah.

31:17.440 --> 31:21.479
So, what if she slips up?

31:22.510 --> 31:24.171
GREGSON:
Miss Mason told her friend

31:24.210 --> 31:26.178
she'd be at the bar
at quarter to 5:00.

31:26.210 --> 31:28.178
We can expect this guy
to set up shop early.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.175
Be ready.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.017
He'll definitely want

31:31.050 --> 31:34.451
the lay of the land
before he makes a move.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.490
Hi there.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.399
Don't move.

31:47.430 --> 31:48.533
MAN:
Hands behind
your back.

31:48.570 --> 31:50.231
BELL:
Get on the ground.

31:50.270 --> 31:51.601
WOMAN:
I'll thank you not to refer

31:51.640 --> 31:53.369
to my client
as "E! Mecanico" again.

31:53.410 --> 31:54.570
He's a gainfully
employed citizen.

31:54.610 --> 31:56.237
GREGSON:
He's on the books

31:56.280 --> 31:59.545
at one of Joaquin Aguilar's
front companies.

31:59.580 --> 32:01.070
Thank you.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.714
Your text said you found him.

32:03.750 --> 32:07.311
El M_ecani_co's real
name is Keith Newell.

32:07.350 --> 32:09.181
I don't envy his attorney
at the moment.

32:09.220 --> 32:10.653
GREGSON:
Your "gainfully employed" client

32:10.690 --> 32:14.626
was carrying a $10,000 handgun
when we picked him up.

32:14.660 --> 32:17.151
That weapon is
registered.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.667
We have him on videotape

32:18.700 --> 32:21.237
lying through his
teeth to the DEA.

32:21.270 --> 32:24.398
ATTORNEY:
I'm not completely
convinced that's my client.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.509
GREGSON:
We have his fingerprints

32:25.540 --> 32:27.007
at three different
murder scenes.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.008
You should be begging

32:29.040 --> 32:31.247
to_talk to me
right now.

32:31.280 --> 32:34.169
You've just caught
a mass murderer.

32:34.220 --> 32:37.542
People have been hunting
for this guy for a decade.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.514
Well done.

32:39.550 --> 32:41.552
And thank you.

32:45.390 --> 32:46.550
What's going on?

32:49.200 --> 32:50.690
Be right back.

32:52.170 --> 32:53.626
I just got a call
from Latent Prints.

32:53.670 --> 32:55.262
Something wrong?

32:55.300 --> 32:56.699
We just compared
that guy's prints

32:56.740 --> 32:58.662
to the ones we found
at all the murders.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.063
They don't match.

33:00.110 --> 33:02.533
What?
Not even close.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.605
No, there's been
a mistake.
We ran it
three times.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.277
Do it again.
That man lied on videotape,

33:06.310 --> 33:08.141
he's missing a finger
on his left hand,

33:08.180 --> 33:09.374
and he was carrying
a designer handgun

33:09.420 --> 33:11.342
which he intended to use
to murder Nigella Mason.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.086
Holmes, are you listening?
The prints don't match.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.213
We can hold him
for trespassing,

33:16.260 --> 33:18.524
but he'll make bail soon.

33:18.560 --> 33:22.189
And when he does, we're going
to have to let him go.

33:35.340 --> 33:38.138
MYCROFI':
Must be a hazard
in your line of work;

33:38.180 --> 33:39.249
frustration.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.475
What?
No, I'm just saying

33:41.520 --> 33:43.112
you've both built
a brilliant case.

33:43.150 --> 33:44.708
I really thought
you had your man.

33:44.750 --> 33:48.459
It must be frustrating
being wrong.

33:48.490 --> 33:49.582
It's true we've reached
a crossroads,

33:49.620 --> 33:52.521
but we're not wrong;
Keith Newell is El Mecanico.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.198
And his fingerprint
didn't match.

33:54.230 --> 33:56.494
That's a factor which needs
to be accounted for.

33:56.530 --> 33:59.465
There's only one explanation
I can come up with.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.365
Which means there's only one
explanation

34:01.400 --> 34:03.334
that we need to investigate:

34:03.370 --> 34:04.439
fake fingerprints.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.364
Fake fingerprints?

34:07.410 --> 34:08.604
It makes perfect sense.

34:08.640 --> 34:11.541
El Mecanico, he's a cautious man
in a hazardous line of work.

34:11.580 --> 34:12.842
He has a set
of false fingerprints

34:12.880 --> 34:14.370
as a last line of defense

34:14.420 --> 34:15.569
against exactly
the kind of meeting

34:15.620 --> 34:16.746
he had today.

34:16.780 --> 34:19.544
I get it. But fake fingerprints?

34:19.590 --> 34:21.182
Is that even possible?

34:21.220 --> 34:22.448
Yeah, of course it is.

34:22.490 --> 34:24.378
They're rarely seen
in the undenNorld.

34:24.430 --> 34:25.658
To make a top-notch pair,

34:25.690 --> 34:27.521
you need
a high-resolution camera,

34:27.560 --> 34:29.425
you need a industrial-grade
chemistry lab,

34:29.460 --> 34:32.463
and ideally,
a set of human hands
for your prints.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.434
El Mecanico works
for a cartel,

34:34.470 --> 34:36.267
so money's no issue,

34:36.300 --> 34:38.439
and I imagine they're awash
with severed hands.

34:38.470 --> 34:41.678
Yeah, that's how he's done it.
Fake fingerprints.

34:41.710 --> 34:43.302
He must have peeled them off

34:43.340 --> 34:45.706
while they were bringing him
to the station.

34:52.290 --> 34:55.418
Uh! Why are you poking me
with your single stick?

34:55.460 --> 34:57.451
I'm poking the covers
to determine whether or not

34:57.490 --> 34:59.253
my brother is in there
with you.

34:59.290 --> 35:00.552
It's just me.

35:00.590 --> 35:02.455
We should get in touch
with him right away.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.592
We're going to Denning.

35:03.630 --> 35:05.564
What's in Denning?

35:05.600 --> 35:08.637
Well, it's where Keith Newell
lives, for one thing.

35:08.670 --> 35:10.467
And why do we need
to see where he lives?

35:10.500 --> 35:12.866
From the DEA files.

35:12.910 --> 35:15.378
Did you know that
the partial prints

35:15.410 --> 35:16.536
attributed to El Mecanico
were found

35:16.580 --> 35:17.877
at three different
crime scenes?

35:17.910 --> 35:19.343
I thought it was
two murders.

35:19.380 --> 35:20.870
Two murders,
three crimes.

35:20.910 --> 35:22.468
So they found the same print

35:22.520 --> 35:25.318
_ at the scene
of a liquor store robbery?

35:25.350 --> 35:27.614
Someone stole all the Strawdog
wine in the place.

35:27.650 --> 35:29.686
Well, that doesn't make
any sense.

35:29.720 --> 35:33.486
Newell, or E! Mecanico, or
whatever you want to call him,

35:33.530 --> 35:35.327
_ _he works for_
a billion-dollar busmess.

35:35.360 --> 35:36.554
He's got
to be paid well,

35:36.600 --> 35:38.261
so I doubt he drinks
cheap wine.

35:38.300 --> 35:40.325
And if he does,
he can pay for it himself.

35:40.370 --> 35:42.565
Which is how I arrived
at my theory:

35:42.600 --> 35:44.204
Newell committed
the massacres

35:44.240 --> 35:45.537
wearing someone else's
fingerprints.

35:45.570 --> 35:47.504
But he didn't do the robbery.

35:47.540 --> 35:50.532
The robbery happened six months
before the first murders.

35:50.580 --> 35:52.502
It was perpetrated
by the original owner

35:52.550 --> 35:53.699
of the fingerprints,

35:53.750 --> 35:55.638
who then donated their hands
to El Mecanico,

35:55.680 --> 35:57.511
presumably not voluntarily.

35:57.550 --> 35:59.541
Mm. Was there a suspect?

35:59.590 --> 36:00.648
There's no mention
of one.

36:00.690 --> 36:02.555
The sheriff who looked
into the robbery

36:02.590 --> 36:05.354
retired some time ago,
but she has agreed
to speak with us.

36:05.390 --> 36:07.620
WOMAN:
I remember what you're talking
about, sure,

36:07.660 --> 36:10.493
but it's a stretch
to call it a case.

36:10.530 --> 36:12.623
Why is that?

36:12.670 --> 36:14.592
Someone stole all the Strawdog.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.494
Just the Strawdog.

36:16.540 --> 36:20.362
We used to have a handful
of homeless people in town,

36:20.410 --> 36:23.470
not more than ten or 12,
but I kept tabs on them.

36:23.510 --> 36:26.445
I was sheriff, it was my job
to know what was going on.

36:26.480 --> 36:30.746
A month or two before
Schultz's liquor store
was robbed,

36:30.780 --> 36:34.284
this new guy drifted into town.

36:34.320 --> 36:37.653
Jed something.
I can't remember his last name,

36:37.690 --> 36:40.682
because everybody just called
him "Strawdog Jed."

36:40.730 --> 36:43.756
This guy spent
most of his day

36:43.800 --> 36:46.519
panhandling out by the lot
where he slept.

36:46.570 --> 36:47.764
I went to pick him up.

36:47.800 --> 36:51.702
Found about ten unopened bottles
of Strawdog,

36:51.740 --> 36:52.764
but no Jed.

36:52.810 --> 36:54.505
I figured
he pulled up stakes

36:54.540 --> 36:56.007
after he robbed
the store.

36:56.040 --> 36:58.304
It's odd,
don't you think,

36:58.350 --> 37:00.705
someone called
Strawdog Jed steals

37:00.750 --> 37:01.876
great quantities
of his favorite drink

37:01.920 --> 37:03.774
and then he just
leaves it all behind?

37:03.820 --> 37:06.709
His drinking buddy sure thought
it was weird.

37:06.750 --> 37:09.583
He swore up and down
that something must've

37:09.620 --> 37:10.587
happened to Jed.

37:10.620 --> 37:11.848
This lot where he slept,

37:11.890 --> 37:13.858
do you think you could
show it to us?

37:13.890 --> 37:16.927
The town redeveloped the lot
with stimulus money.

37:16.960 --> 37:20.566
It's been a park
for about five years now.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.761
And where was it
that Jed slept?

37:22.800 --> 37:23.789
Oh, I guess

37:23.840 --> 37:26.308
right around there.

37:26.340 --> 37:28.729
So what was the ground like
before the lot was converted?

37:28.780 --> 37:29.599
Was there greenery?

37:29.640 --> 37:31.904
Oh, maybe a weed or two.
Other than that,

37:31.950 --> 37:34.510
it was just a patch
of hardscrabble dirt.

37:34.550 --> 37:35.744
Excellent.

37:35.780 --> 37:37.714
Why is that excellent?

37:37.750 --> 37:39.741
Well, everything would have
been planted

37:39.790 --> 37:40.916
at roughly the same time

37:40.950 --> 37:43.783
when the lot was converted
into a park.

37:43.820 --> 37:45.685
So everything's

37:45.730 --> 37:47.652
of uniform age.

37:47.690 --> 37:49.294
Well, except for this
oak tree.

37:49.330 --> 37:51.798
HOLMES:
This tree's the same age
as the others,

37:51.830 --> 37:53.366
just taller and lusher

37:53.400 --> 37:54.765
and healthier.

37:54.800 --> 37:57.462
Maybe it got more food
than the other ones.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.536
Precisely.

37:59.570 --> 38:03.677
Something in the soil's provided
extra nutrients for this tree.

38:03.710 --> 38:06.941
You think something was
decomposing down there.

38:06.980 --> 38:09.949
We're gonna need the police,
some men with shovels.

38:09.980 --> 38:11.845
But I think we might
be standing

38:11.890 --> 38:14.415
on the grave
of Strawdog Jed.

38:14.460 --> 38:17.020
GREGSON:
Mr. Newell, on behalf
of the City of New York,

38:17.060 --> 38:18.721
we'd like to thank you
for providing us

38:18.760 --> 38:20.523
with your fingerprints
and your DNA sample.

38:20.560 --> 38:24.052
We are unable to link them
to either the mass killings

38:24.100 --> 38:27.399
associated with the Robles
narcotics cartel.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.898
So we wanted to apologize

38:29.940 --> 38:32.329
for any imposition
on your time.

38:32.370 --> 38:33.928
We appreciate that.

38:33.970 --> 38:35.972
However, we have been in touch

38:36.010 --> 38:38.342
with the police department
of Denning, New York.

38:38.380 --> 38:41.713
It seems that they have
a new lead

38:41.750 --> 38:44.947
in the disappearance
of a man named

38:44.990 --> 38:46.639
Jed Eichen.

38:46.690 --> 38:49.887
BELL:
You might remember him
as "Strawdog Jed."

38:49.920 --> 38:51.114
Turns out someone killed him.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.788
Buried him right there in town.

38:53.830 --> 38:55.559
No hands.

38:55.600 --> 38:59.422
But we did_find
some hairs

38:59.470 --> 39:02.496
that weren't
_ Mr._Eichen's buried
right in there With him.

39:02.540 --> 39:05.008
Care to guess
whose DNA they matched?

39:05.040 --> 39:07.065
REPORTER:
As part of a plea bargain,

39:07.110 --> 39:10.637
New York resident Keith Newell
confessed today to working

39:10.680 --> 39:13.706
as a hired gunman
for the Robles narcotics cartel.

39:13.750 --> 39:15.115
It remains unclear
(doorbell rings)

39:15.150 --> 39:16.879
exactly how many murders
Newell...

39:20.150 --> 39:21.378
Hi.

39:23.160 --> 39:25.458
I'm here for Sherlock.

39:28.860 --> 39:30.748
I'm sure he'll be right up.

39:36.870 --> 39:39.031
We've hired a chef.

39:40.470 --> 39:42.006
For the restaurant.

39:42.040 --> 39:44.406
That's great.

39:44.450 --> 39:47.578
We'll be refining the menu
over the next couple of days.

39:48.950 --> 39:50.679
Congratulations.

39:50.720 --> 39:53.439
Thank you.

39:53.490 --> 39:55.117
H was wondering...

39:58.160 --> 40:00.958
...would you be my guest
for the opening?

40:02.730 --> 40:05.722
Wow, that's so nice.
I would I...

40:11.940 --> 40:14.909
Do you think that's
gonna complicate things?

40:15.940 --> 40:17.601
Look, uh...

40:17.640 --> 40:19.107
setting aside

40:19.150 --> 40:21.471
the events of London,
I've come to think of you

40:21.520 --> 40:23.476
as an extraordinary person.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.681
I'm so grateful
you're in my brother's life.

40:27.620 --> 40:31.829
And I would like very much
the chance for you and I...

40:31.860 --> 40:34.078
to become friends.

40:39.700 --> 40:42.430
(horns honk and beep)

40:57.050 --> 40:59.018
Marchioness.

40:59.050 --> 41:02.087
So, you'll be pleased to hear
I have reached out

41:02.120 --> 41:05.851
to certain attorneys known to
associate with Joaquin Aguilar.

41:05.890 --> 41:08.654
I made it quite clear that
if any harm comes to you,

41:08.700 --> 41:12.158
I will expose the fact that
Aguilar knowingly sold a foal

41:12.200 --> 41:14.760
with fraudulent bloodlines.

41:14.800 --> 41:17.234
I'm confident
he'll cut his losses.

41:17.270 --> 41:20.034
You should be safe.

41:20.070 --> 41:21.901
Thank you.

41:23.580 --> 41:25.502
And what about me?

41:25.550 --> 41:28.576
Why, that's up
to my brother to decide.

41:32.620 --> 41:35.214
You are, as
of this moment,

41:35.260 --> 41:38.184
out of the
stud business.

41:38.220 --> 41:40.188
You're not
gonna report me?

41:40.230 --> 41:42.050
I'm not done.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.125
We've seen your records.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.560
Between the insurance
payments you'll get
for Dalton Ladd's death

41:46.600 --> 41:48.534
and the money you've saved,
you'll have enough

41:48.570 --> 41:50.231
to repay the victims
of your scam.

41:50.270 --> 41:53.262
You can keep the money
Joaquin Aguilar gave you.

41:53.310 --> 41:56.575
Use it to fund a new,
hopefully more respectable

41:56.610 --> 41:58.271
start in life.

41:58.310 --> 42:00.073
Sherlock and I

42:00.110 --> 42:02.544
will, of course,
oversee the repayments.

42:03.620 --> 42:05.542
Thank you.

42:05.590 --> 42:08.855
It's been lovely
seeing you again, Nigella.

42:08.890 --> 42:11.108
But if it's all
the same with you,

42:11.160 --> 42:13.720
I'd like to have a coffee
with my brother.

42:13.760 --> 42:16.149
*

42:24.340 --> 42:25.967
(door closes)

42:26.010 --> 42:29.309
I won't discuss
the holidays, you know.

42:29.340 --> 42:30.978
That's fine.

42:31.010 --> 42:32.875
_ I've no interest
in covering our past

42:32.910 --> 42:37.813
in a glaze of nostalgia.
I accept your
terms completely.

42:37.850 --> 42:40.614
Where does that
leave us, then?

42:42.120 --> 42:45.123
What would you like
to talk about?
