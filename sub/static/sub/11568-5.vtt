This way.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.226
How long has
the boy been missing?

00:27.228 --> 00:29.561
We don't know exactly.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.797
We only started looking
when he failed to show up
for classes this morning.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.399
It's most upsetting.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.801
Please, the Dean's office
is just up these stairs.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.469
You guys got a bathroom?

00:37.471 --> 00:40.039
Oh, yes.
Uh, we just passed it.

No, no, no. I mean right now.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.844

01:26.787 --> 01:29.354
That's cool.
What you want, Deezy?

01:29.356 --> 01:31.857
I'm just checking
your availability
to co-host <i> The View.</i>

01:31.859 --> 01:33.125

01:33.127 --> 01:34.526

So when do you think
you're going to have
this mystery wrapped up?

01:51.112 --> 01:52.711
Just so I'm
abreast of your schedule.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.713
I don't know, Deezy,
we're about to meet the Dean

01:54.715 --> 01:56.448
and then I'll have
a better idea.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.950
So, what's going on with you?

01:57.952 --> 02:00.886
You going back to Michigan
for Thanksgiving?

02:00.888 --> 02:03.122
Saint Louis? Why are you
going to Saint Louis?

02:03.124 --> 02:04.923
You're from Saint Louis?

02:04.925 --> 02:07.759
How come this whole time
I thought you were
from Michigan?

02:07.761 --> 02:11.396
Why didn't you say nothing
when I got you
that Megatron jersey?

02:11.398 --> 02:13.565
Didn't want to
make me feel bad?

02:13.567 --> 02:16.969
You can make me feel bad,
that's what friends are for.

02:16.971 --> 02:19.238
Of course,
I consider you a friend!

02:19.240 --> 02:21.640
Could one of you maybe
please go in and get him?

02:21.642 --> 02:23.575
This is really quite urgent.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.144

Almost done.

I've got another call.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.250
It's George Lopez.
We've been playing phone tag.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.751
Okay, well, call me
after you get done.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.586
No, no, no, stay on, I'll...

I'll merge the call.

If I hang up on you
just call me back.

02:43.464 --> 02:46.465
No, don't call me back.
That'll (BLEEP) up my call.

Oh, hell yeah, I did it!

02:57.945 --> 02:59.611
Oh, (BLEEP),
my phone's about to die.

03:02.448 --> 03:05.050
To think that he could be
somewhere out there

03:05.052 --> 03:07.619
in that cold and rain.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.054
A young boy...

03:09.056 --> 03:10.822
Did you contact the police?

03:10.824 --> 03:13.192
We were hoping
to avoid that, you see.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.793
This is a delicate matter

03:14.795 --> 03:17.196
owing to who
the boy's mother is.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.664
Who is his mother?

03:18.666 --> 03:22.367
United States Senator
Elaine Fitzpatrick.

03:22.369 --> 03:26.004
Not that one child
is any more precious
than another,

03:26.006 --> 03:29.074
but obviously
the publicity involved
in something like this

03:29.076 --> 03:32.211
could be terribly damaging
for Foxcroft Academy.

03:32.213 --> 03:36.481
You know, institutions
such as Foxcroft
are increasingly rare,

03:36.483 --> 03:39.518
for it is we alone who demand

03:39.520 --> 03:43.589
a strict adherence
to traditional educational
standards

03:43.591 --> 03:48.327
in curricula
which have scarcely changed
in more than 200 years.

03:49.329 --> 03:50.929
Okay,

03:50.931 --> 03:53.899
I have a question that no one
has bothered to ask.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.401
Has anyone thought of
calling the police?

03:56.403 --> 03:59.438
Uh, I already
asked that question.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.307
I see.
Then we don't have much time.

04:05.678 --> 04:08.347
Oh, and one final question.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.881
Tell me what happened

04:09.883 --> 04:12.050
that you are just meeting us
for the first time

04:12.052 --> 04:14.586

What about my breasts?

04:29.937 --> 04:31.937
I mean, don't we need
to bind them or something?

04:31.939 --> 04:34.406

04:34.408 --> 04:37.042

do you think you look like?

04:39.546 --> 04:40.979

going to work.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.381
I don't look like a boy.

in the hallway

04:44.885 --> 04:47.486

and get to class!

04:47.488 --> 04:49.755
You could never become
the man you're meant to be

04:49.757 --> 04:52.057
if you keep acting
like the boy you are.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.158

about this all wrong.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.591
While the rest of the kids
are in class,

05:26.593 --> 05:29.261
maybe we should go check out
Timothy's dorm room,

05:29.263 --> 05:31.096
we may find some clues.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.444
Okay, uh, there's a tradition

05:45.446 --> 05:47.813
that all the first years do,

05:47.815 --> 05:53.285
where they go out in the woods
behind the school at night
and they have a party.

05:53.287 --> 05:55.320
Mmm! Well, that sounds fun.

05:55.322 --> 05:58.457
No, it's not a regular party.
It's a...

Um, I don't want to say it.
It's...

06:00.627 --> 06:01.727
It's a...

06:01.729 --> 06:02.861

06:02.863 --> 06:04.830
They call it a jack-off party.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.299
Still sounds fun. What?

06:07.301 --> 06:09.835
What the (BLEEP)
is a jack-off party?

06:09.837 --> 06:13.004
Apparently, it's a party where
all the boys, you know,

06:13.006 --> 06:15.507
jack-off.

06:15.509 --> 06:18.643
And I guess curfew's at 11:00,
so they all stopped at 10:45,
so they could get back,

06:18.645 --> 06:20.979
except Timothy
who just kept going.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.749
They said they tried to
get him to stop,
but he refused, so,

06:23.751 --> 06:25.150
they just left him
in the woods

06:25.152 --> 06:27.185
to jack-off.

06:27.187 --> 06:31.390
For a person who seems
incredibly uncomfortable
saying, "Jack-off,"

06:31.392 --> 06:34.025
it seems weird
you threw in that last one.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.695
So did anyone go looking
for him this morning?

06:36.697 --> 06:38.430
Yes, and he wasn't there.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.865
I bet a bear ate him.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.666
Aren't bears
attracted to semen?

06:41.668 --> 06:42.834
I know sharks are.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.403
I learned that the hard way.

because I'm just distraught
over this little missing boy

07:13.100 --> 07:15.700
and the fact that we were
just going to give up on him.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.105
and planted their seeds.

one of those seeds germinated.

08:31.445 --> 08:33.445
Thank you, Timothy.

08:33.447 --> 08:35.981

THE TREE:
Are you Douglas Wills?

09:40.414 --> 09:44.849
The Douglas Wills that
attended Foxcroft Academy
for Boys,

09:44.851 --> 09:47.018
class of 1981?

09:47.020 --> 09:49.387
-(GASPS)
-(BOTH SCREAM)

09:49.389 --> 09:51.756
(STAMMERS) Yes, yes, yes!

(GASPS)

09:54.194 --> 09:56.094
(SCREAMS)

09:56.096 --> 09:58.263
-THE TREE:
Pull down your pants.
-What?

09:58.931 --> 10:00.198
Ahhh!

10:00.200 --> 10:02.867
Now, I have snatched
every pecker

10:02.869 --> 10:08.039
from every boy
that ever spilt his
pecker wit on me.

10:08.041 --> 10:11.309
-And they're all hanging
in my branches.
-(GASPS)

10:11.311 --> 10:15.814
Douglas, it's time for me
to add your pecker
to my branches.

10:15.816 --> 10:19.551
Now, hold up your pecker,
so I can snatch it off.

10:19.553 --> 10:22.887
-WOMAN: No! Stop! Oh, no!
-No, no, please, please, no!

10:22.889 --> 10:25.457
THE TREE:
Woman, you should not
be with this man.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.225
He's no good.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.395
I think you should
get yourself a job
and make your own money

10:30.397 --> 10:33.231
and not go out with men
with a convertible car.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.833
Now, Douglas,

10:34.835 --> 10:38.236
it's time to say goodbye
to your pecker.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.971
Oh, God, no!

10:39.973 --> 10:42.574
Ahhh! Ahhh!

10:42.576 --> 10:44.409
-(GASPS)
-THE TREE: Douglas...

10:44.411 --> 10:46.945
Good Lord,
you have a nice pecker.

10:46.947 --> 10:49.080
It feels so good!

10:49.082 --> 10:51.049
