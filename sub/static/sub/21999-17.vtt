MAN: Freeze! Don't move!

01:35.445 --> 01:38.790
Hey, boss. I'm headed to the airport.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.852
My daughter's flight gets in
in less than an hour, so...

01:43.854 --> 01:46.131
She's coming for her campus visit.

01:47.591 --> 01:49.858
Okay, I'm gonna hop in a cab.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.727
Be back this afternoon.
Got my cell if you need me.

01:52.729 --> 01:54.462
Okay.

01:55.140 --> 01:58.099
Hey, you want to take my car?

02:00.155 --> 02:02.356
Well, you want to impress Anna,
don't you?

02:02.358 --> 02:05.225
You want her to be so impressed
that she moves here in the fall

02:05.227 --> 02:07.327
so you can be a bigger part of her life?

02:07.329 --> 02:09.830
Take my car and driver.
It's very impressive.

02:09.832 --> 02:11.932
Thank you, Dr. Bull.

02:11.934 --> 02:14.668
How are you guys doing, by the way?

02:14.670 --> 02:17.738
Me and Anna? Fine.

02:17.740 --> 02:19.006
Why?

02:19.008 --> 02:21.608
Well, for the first 18 years of her life,

02:21.610 --> 02:23.777
you were Uncle Chunk, Mom's best friend.

02:23.779 --> 02:25.112
And then at Thanksgiving,

02:25.114 --> 02:26.747
you tell her you're actually her dad.

02:26.749 --> 02:28.682
That's a lot to throw at an 18-year-old.

02:28.684 --> 02:30.217
That's funny.

02:30.753 --> 02:33.320
She's been really difficult
to reach lately.

02:33.322 --> 02:36.390
I figure she's just really busy
with senior year stuff.

02:36.415 --> 02:37.824
But I'm hoping

02:37.826 --> 02:41.194
once we actually get to
spend some time together,

02:41.196 --> 02:44.431
be in the same place, things will...

02:44.433 --> 02:46.800
things will get back to normal.

02:48.026 --> 02:51.905
Your mom sent me the itinerary
from your university, and...

02:51.907 --> 02:54.908
since you don't have anything
scheduled for tomorrow night,

02:54.910 --> 02:56.643
I made us a dinner reservation

02:56.645 --> 02:58.545
at a really cool Italian spot downtown.

02:58.547 --> 03:00.113
7:00 p.m.

03:00.115 --> 03:01.848
That okay with you?

03:01.850 --> 03:04.017
Guess so.

03:06.288 --> 03:08.522
And my offer still stands.

03:08.524 --> 03:10.824
My place isn't a palace,
but if you have any issues

03:10.826 --> 03:13.093
staying in the dorms, you know...

03:13.095 --> 03:17.230
That's kind of the whole point, isn't it?

03:17.232 --> 03:18.807
It is.

03:19.602 --> 03:22.636
I'm so proud of you.

03:22.638 --> 03:24.563
So impressed.

03:25.541 --> 03:29.076
So, what's first on your agenda today?

03:29.078 --> 03:30.877
I'm meeting with Chloe Tomlin.

03:30.879 --> 03:34.481
Chloe Tomlin. I know that name.

03:34.483 --> 03:35.882
Maybe you've read her.

03:35.884 --> 03:37.618
She's an investigative journalist

03:37.620 --> 03:39.286
for the <i> New York Ledger.</i>

03:39.288 --> 03:41.054
She's also an adjunct professor here,

03:41.056 --> 03:42.623
and she's the one who recommended me

03:42.625 --> 03:44.558
for the scholarship.

03:45.427 --> 03:47.661
Uh, Ms. Tomlin?

03:47.663 --> 03:50.063
I'm Anna Baker.

03:50.065 --> 03:51.765
I'm a prospective freshman.

03:51.767 --> 03:53.634
Okay.

03:53.636 --> 03:55.869
Uh, you recommended me
for the scholarship?

03:55.871 --> 03:57.137
And did you get it?

03:57.139 --> 03:58.572
Yes. You're welcome.

03:59.222 --> 04:01.441
W-We had an 11:00 a.m.

04:01.975 --> 04:04.011
I'm sorry. I would have called to cancel,

04:04.013 --> 04:06.647
but they really do only give you
one call from jail,

04:06.649 --> 04:09.349
and I used it to ask my editor
to bail me out.

04:09.351 --> 04:10.884
You were in jail?

04:10.886 --> 04:12.252
Sure was.

04:12.254 --> 04:14.454
Probably should only
discuss that with a lawyer,

04:14.456 --> 04:18.349
which I don't have and need
to find and can't really afford.

04:18.351 --> 04:20.127
Maybe you can help her, Dad.

04:20.781 --> 04:23.148
I don't really have the authority to...

04:29.238 --> 04:30.937
Here you go.

04:30.939 --> 04:34.641
Now, I'm not sure how my boss
is gonna feel about your case.

04:34.643 --> 04:36.910
I'm not sure how you're
gonna feel about my boss.

04:36.912 --> 04:38.311
But give me your card,

04:38.313 --> 04:41.181
and we'll see if we can at least
put together a meeting.

04:49.310 --> 04:51.925
I feel obliged to point out
that you are flirting

04:51.927 --> 04:53.627
with an enormous liability risk here.

04:53.629 --> 04:54.795
Quiet, you two.

04:54.797 --> 04:56.096
Don't distract him.
Let the man do his work.

04:56.098 --> 04:59.232
Seriously, this is how
you conduct a job interview?

04:59.234 --> 05:00.734
Absolutely.

05:00.736 --> 05:02.736
When I'm interviewing someone
for a job I don't understand,

05:02.738 --> 05:05.272
asking him to do something
I don't know how to do.

05:08.110 --> 05:09.509
Okay.

05:09.511 --> 05:11.044
Give it a try Dr. Bull.

05:11.046 --> 05:12.671
You sure?

05:13.782 --> 05:17.084
Ripley, double macchiato.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.893
Ah.

05:38.073 --> 05:41.942
Hmm. Two shots.

05:41.944 --> 05:43.443
Dab of milk.

05:43.445 --> 05:45.545
Piping hot.

05:48.784 --> 05:51.718
Mmm. It's delicious.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.254
Hire this man. What'd you say
your name was again, son?

05:54.256 --> 05:55.422
Isaiah.

05:55.447 --> 05:57.591
I-I know it's a little unusual.

05:57.593 --> 05:58.792
Oh, relax.

05:58.794 --> 06:00.527
The woman you're replacing
is named after wire,

06:00.529 --> 06:02.129
and we got a guy around here

06:02.131 --> 06:03.830
named after a kind of peanut butter.

06:03.832 --> 06:05.140
You'll fit right in.

06:09.019 --> 06:10.871
CHUNK: Dr. Bull.

06:10.873 --> 06:12.839
This is Chloe Tomlin,

06:12.841 --> 06:15.542
the young lady that I spoke
to you about yesterday.

06:15.544 --> 06:17.978
CHLOE: About six months
ago, this woman...

06:17.980 --> 06:19.813
let's call her Meg... looked me up

06:19.815 --> 06:22.949
and told me a story about a date
with a guy she met on Spark4U.

06:22.951 --> 06:25.719
Mm. Spark4U is the
most popular dating app

06:25.721 --> 06:27.554
in all of North America.

06:29.539 --> 06:30.824
What?

06:31.927 --> 06:34.728
That's just a known fact.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.297
So, this woman Meg...

06:37.299 --> 06:38.765
Meets this dude at a restaurant.

06:38.767 --> 06:40.867
They have a few drinks,
but she's not feeling it,

06:40.869 --> 06:42.035
so she decides to go.

06:42.037 --> 06:43.570
The guy must have followed her out,

06:43.572 --> 06:44.871
because before she knows it,

06:44.873 --> 06:47.541
he has pushed her into an alley,
and he's on top of her.

06:47.543 --> 06:48.642
You can guess the rest.

06:48.644 --> 06:50.677
So did she go to the police?

06:50.679 --> 06:53.046
Yes, but there wasn't much they could do.

06:53.048 --> 06:55.182
The only information she had
about her rapist

06:55.184 --> 06:56.650
was from the Spark4U app.

06:56.652 --> 06:58.151
BULL: And let me guess.

06:58.153 --> 06:59.731
The entire profile was fake.

06:59.733 --> 07:03.056
Plus, the I.P. address
he used to make it was public.

07:03.058 --> 07:05.892
Turns out Spark4U's
lauded security features

07:05.894 --> 07:08.962
do next to nothing
to actually vet their users.

07:08.964 --> 07:10.497
So the police never found the guy.

07:10.499 --> 07:11.998
BULL: Okay.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.868
Let's jump to the part where you
break into their headquarters.

07:14.870 --> 07:16.503
Turns out several of the women

07:16.505 --> 07:19.339
in Meg's online
sexual assault survivors forum

07:19.341 --> 07:21.975
had also met their assailants on Spark4U.

07:21.977 --> 07:24.578
So she broke into Spark4U to get proof

07:24.580 --> 07:27.247
so that she could publish her exposé.

07:27.249 --> 07:29.349
How'd you know what you were looking for?

07:29.351 --> 07:30.984
Or where to find it?

07:30.986 --> 07:33.486
How'd you even get in?

07:33.488 --> 07:35.121
I had a source.

07:35.123 --> 07:37.157
Someone inside the company;
they sent me a key card

07:37.159 --> 07:38.959
and codes to access the file.

07:38.961 --> 07:41.828
The irony is no one
would have known I was there

07:41.830 --> 07:44.731
if the security protocol
hadn't changed that afternoon.

07:44.733 --> 07:47.367
Well, there's our defense:
it's not burglary

07:47.369 --> 07:49.736
if someone with lawful authority
gave her the key.

07:49.738 --> 07:51.738
“Our”?

07:51.740 --> 07:53.773
Does that mean you're taking my case?

07:53.775 --> 07:58.044
It'd be a real shame to
let a little legal snafu

07:58.046 --> 08:00.347
derail such a promising career.

08:00.349 --> 08:01.815
Especially when that career is...

08:01.817 --> 08:03.316
I don't know...

08:03.318 --> 08:06.186
cornerstone of any functional democracy.

08:06.845 --> 08:08.555
Thank you, Dr. Bull.

08:08.557 --> 08:11.338
Thank you, Mr. Palmer,
and thank you, Mr. Colón.

08:11.340 --> 08:12.693
Can I see the paperwork from

08:12.718 --> 08:14.111
- your arraignment?
- Yeah.

08:17.132 --> 08:19.833
Oh. It's my editor. May I?

08:19.835 --> 08:21.134
Yeah.

08:21.136 --> 08:22.435
Hey, Tom.

08:22.437 --> 08:24.704
Hey, uh, guys? I-I don't get this.

08:24.706 --> 08:27.040
If Chloe's being charged with burglary,

08:27.042 --> 08:29.109
why is her arraignment in federal court?

08:29.111 --> 08:30.895
BAILIFF: <i>The court calls Chloe Tomlin</i>

08:30.897 --> 08:34.914
in the matter of <i> United States</i>
<i>v. Chloe Tomlin.</i>

08:36.919 --> 08:39.219
AUSA Hartman.

08:39.221 --> 08:42.522
She's tough, smart.

08:42.524 --> 08:44.424
BULL: Who's Mr. Skinny Tie?

08:44.426 --> 08:47.560
Garrett Gatewood.
He's the CEO of Spark4U.

08:47.562 --> 08:49.629
Never trust a man in a skinny tie.

08:49.631 --> 08:52.065
Ms. Tomlin, you are charged
with the burglary

08:52.067 --> 08:54.701
of Spark4U Enterprises Incorporated,

08:54.703 --> 08:56.236
as well as economic espionage

08:56.238 --> 08:59.406
and the theft of trade secrets.
How do you plead?

08:59.408 --> 09:01.574
I-I don't understand.
What does that mean?

09:01.576 --> 09:03.109
They're accusing you

09:03.111 --> 09:04.678
of stealing proprietary technology.

09:04.680 --> 09:08.081
The penalty for that is over
30 years in federal prison.

09:08.083 --> 09:10.216
But I didn't do that.
That doesn't make any sense.

09:10.218 --> 09:11.751
My client pleads not guilty, Your Honor.

09:11.753 --> 09:13.453
Take a breath. We'll figure this out.

09:16.258 --> 09:19.259
Your Honor, because
Ms. Tomlin was apprehended

09:19.261 --> 09:21.394
with privileged company information,

09:21.396 --> 09:24.264
I'm requesting a gag order
for the duration of trial.

09:24.266 --> 09:26.499
Your Honor, my client is a journalist.

09:26.501 --> 09:30.136
She has an article, and she has
every right to publish it.

09:30.138 --> 09:34.607
Prior restraint for fear
of harm or libel to Spark4U

09:34.609 --> 09:37.510
is a direct violation
of the First Amendment.

09:37.512 --> 09:39.946
I hear your concerns, Counselor,
but given the charges,

09:39.948 --> 09:42.349
I'm inclined to agree with the AUSA.

09:42.351 --> 09:44.918
I'll grant the gag order.

09:45.887 --> 09:47.821
I don't understand. What just happened?

09:47.823 --> 09:49.456
You just lost the right to publish

09:49.458 --> 09:51.224
anything that has to do with Spark4U.

09:51.226 --> 09:54.995
But th-they can't.
I gave those women my word.

09:54.997 --> 09:57.263
I'll just publish it under a pseudonym

09:57.265 --> 09:58.798
or-or leak it someplace.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.967
No, no, no, no, Chloe. You can't do that.

10:00.969 --> 10:02.369
Benny's right.

10:02.371 --> 10:05.305
The only way your story
sees the light of day now

10:05.307 --> 10:07.874
is if we win this case.

10:07.876 --> 10:13.633
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

10:15.921 --> 10:17.611
It's super basic, you know?

10:17.636 --> 10:20.395
Programming a drone
to sync up to an espresso maker.

10:21.173 --> 10:24.663
Good for him.
I'm glad somebody has a job.

10:24.665 --> 10:26.910
Now I'm sorry I told you about it.

10:29.832 --> 10:31.759
So, how's your job hunt going?

10:31.761 --> 10:33.928
Who would have thunk it?

10:33.930 --> 10:35.763
Turns out an FBI arrest is a barrier

10:35.765 --> 10:38.812
to employment in the world
of cybersecurity. Go figure.

10:41.302 --> 10:43.271
You know what I really miss about TAC?

10:43.273 --> 10:45.940
I mean, other than you guys.

10:45.942 --> 10:48.343
The work really felt
like it meant something.

10:49.132 --> 10:51.112
ISAIAH: <i>I don't get it. If all she stole</i>

10:51.114 --> 10:53.648
were client complaints and
e-mails from the company

10:53.650 --> 10:54.916
saying how sorry they were

10:54.918 --> 10:56.784
and that they were
working on the problem,

10:56.786 --> 10:58.553
what's all this encryption about?

10:58.555 --> 11:01.189
Exactly. Bull is betting that
once we have this decrypted,

11:01.191 --> 11:03.625
it'll prove that Chloe
took this file for her story,

11:03.627 --> 11:05.660
not so she could sell trade secrets.

11:08.164 --> 11:10.365
Oops.

11:14.638 --> 11:17.505
I don't get that this has
anything to do with her story.

11:17.507 --> 11:19.841
Wow. What are we looking at?

11:23.647 --> 11:25.613
ISAIAH: Looks like in-app advertising.

11:25.615 --> 11:27.348
Two people swipe and “spark,”

11:27.350 --> 11:30.018
and the app suggests
nearby places for them to meet.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.320
I get it. These places
pay to be featured.

11:32.322 --> 11:34.255
It's some kind of new revenue stream.

11:34.257 --> 11:36.791
And since it hasn't gone to market yet,

11:36.793 --> 11:39.432
it is definitely proprietary.

11:40.363 --> 11:42.497
But what did Chloe want with it?

11:42.499 --> 11:44.265
I have no idea.

11:46.236 --> 11:49.871
I can't believe that the
AUSA got the judge to agree

11:49.873 --> 11:52.807
to a closed courtroom,
on top of the gag order.

11:52.809 --> 11:55.143
You know, they're acting like
Spark4U's “trade secret”"

11:55.145 --> 11:56.744
are the damn nuclear codes.

11:56.746 --> 11:59.380
The worst part is closed court
means empty gallery.

11:59.382 --> 12:01.582
Empty gallery means no mirror jury.

12:01.584 --> 12:03.885
We really need to nail this voir dire,

12:03.887 --> 12:06.762
'cause once the trial starts,
we'll be flying blind.

12:06.764 --> 12:08.690
What about whistle-blowers?

12:08.692 --> 12:11.592
We cast Chloe's source at Spark4U...

12:11.594 --> 12:14.429
and by extension, Chloe herself...

12:14.431 --> 12:15.830
as a whistle-blower.

12:15.832 --> 12:17.532
MARISSA: Excuse me, gentlemen.

12:17.534 --> 12:19.600
I hate to interrupt, but...

12:19.602 --> 12:22.203
I have bad news and worse news.

12:22.205 --> 12:23.504
Go easy.

12:23.506 --> 12:25.652
Let's start with the bad news first.

12:25.654 --> 12:28.142
Isaiah and I have been
through everything in the file

12:28.144 --> 12:29.644
that Chloe was apprehended with,

12:29.646 --> 12:32.313
and the contents in there can, in fact,

12:32.315 --> 12:35.283
reasonably be classified
as trade secrets.

12:35.285 --> 12:36.984
Excellent.

12:36.986 --> 12:38.986
What could be worse?

12:38.988 --> 12:40.221
None of it appears to have

12:40.223 --> 12:41.995
anything to do with Chloe's story.

12:43.872 --> 12:46.094
Well, you were right.

12:46.096 --> 12:48.863
That Chloe Tomlin is an impressive lady.

12:48.865 --> 12:51.399
I did some prep with her this afternoon.

12:51.401 --> 12:53.234
Smart, poised.

12:53.236 --> 12:54.769
I bet we have her

12:54.771 --> 12:57.038
back at that school for you in no time.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.837
Just promise me you'll
never go on that Spark4U app.

12:59.839 --> 13:01.192
Don't.

13:02.223 --> 13:03.344
Don't what?

13:03.346 --> 13:04.976
Don't do that.

13:05.415 --> 13:07.949
Don't try and act all dad-ish.

13:07.951 --> 13:10.518
Okay.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.253
I wasn't.

13:12.255 --> 13:14.856
And by the way,
there's no “ish” about it.

13:14.858 --> 13:16.324
I am your dad.

13:16.326 --> 13:19.026
Yeah, well, you don't get
to not be my dad for 18 years

13:19.028 --> 13:20.394
and then just turn it on now

13:20.396 --> 13:22.029
because I happen to be
in the neighborhood.

13:22.031 --> 13:24.699
Is that how you think it went down?

13:24.701 --> 13:26.134
What am I supposed to think?

13:26.136 --> 13:28.903
You were my mom's gay
best friend for my whole life,

13:28.905 --> 13:31.472
and now suddenly you're my father?

13:31.474 --> 13:33.040
Look...

13:33.042 --> 13:36.244
I get how... it could be confusing.

13:36.246 --> 13:38.980
It was confusing living through it.

13:38.982 --> 13:41.282
And I know, at 17, 18,

13:41.284 --> 13:43.384
you think you know exactly who you are,

13:43.386 --> 13:45.153
but you don't, you just...

13:45.895 --> 13:47.288
you don't.

13:47.894 --> 13:51.159
Where your mother and I grew up,
not being like everyone else

13:51.161 --> 13:53.895
was not even something I considered.

13:53.897 --> 13:55.930
I was good at football.

13:55.932 --> 13:59.333
And your mother, she was just like you.

13:59.335 --> 14:02.937
Curious and wicked smart
and so beautiful.

14:03.701 --> 14:06.474
We really did love each other.

14:06.476 --> 14:09.510
And then I got my scholarship,
and your mother decided

14:09.512 --> 14:11.846
that she was gonna go
to school close to home,

14:11.848 --> 14:14.849
just like a half a dozen
other couples in high school.

14:14.851 --> 14:17.018
I never knew she was pregnant.

14:17.020 --> 14:18.820
She didn't tell me.

14:18.822 --> 14:22.256
If I had known, I never
would have left you both.

14:22.258 --> 14:25.293
What I don't understand is,
when you quit football,

14:25.295 --> 14:30.131
when you found out I was yours,
why didn't you come back?

14:34.904 --> 14:38.439
You were in the first grade when
I saw your birth certificate,

14:38.441 --> 14:40.141
when I did the math.

14:40.143 --> 14:42.143
And by then, you and your mother,

14:42.145 --> 14:45.201
you had your own routine,
your own way of...

14:46.661 --> 14:48.549
Look, we talked about it.

14:48.551 --> 14:50.985
We just didn't want to confuse you.

14:50.987 --> 14:52.553
So we decided

14:52.555 --> 14:54.789
that I would stay in New York for work

14:54.791 --> 14:57.458
and be Uncle Chunk when
I flew down every few months.

14:57.460 --> 15:00.895
<i>You</i> decided.
It wasn't your decision to make.

15:00.897 --> 15:03.097
Come on, Anna, you were six.

15:03.099 --> 15:04.357
You know what? I really
ought to be going.

15:04.382 --> 15:05.638
Anna.

15:16.346 --> 15:18.412
Coffee. Black, one sugar.

15:18.414 --> 15:19.547
Thanks.

15:19.549 --> 15:22.250
When did I tell you how I take my coffee?

15:22.252 --> 15:24.552
You didn't. I read that series you wrote

15:24.554 --> 15:26.520
about the rise of the coffee shop

15:26.522 --> 15:28.522
and the death of the neighborhood diner.

15:28.524 --> 15:30.157
That was a long time ago.

15:30.159 --> 15:33.761
Hmm, nonetheless,
I see you sipping your coffee.

15:33.763 --> 15:36.931
I've been reading a lot of your
writing the past couple days.

15:38.034 --> 15:39.867
You strike me as someone
who's fairly pure of heart.

15:39.869 --> 15:41.202
Okay.

15:41.204 --> 15:43.484
So I need your help
reconciling something.

15:43.486 --> 15:46.872
If you went into Spark4U
looking for proof

15:46.874 --> 15:48.643
that the company was trying
to silence its victims,

15:48.645 --> 15:50.544
why were you caught with plans

15:50.546 --> 15:52.380
for an exclusive advertising feature,

15:52.382 --> 15:56.050
plans Spark4U's competitors
would pay mightily for?

15:56.052 --> 15:57.685
What?

15:57.687 --> 16:01.188
That... that's not possible.
That's not what I did.

16:01.190 --> 16:03.524
Well, it may not have been
what you intended,

16:03.526 --> 16:05.927
but we decrypted the files you stole,

16:05.929 --> 16:07.762
and that's what they contain.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.563
I don't know.

16:09.565 --> 16:12.066
Maybe I-I transposed some of
the digits on the file number.

16:12.068 --> 16:14.068
I memorized it really fast.
Or maybe they changed

16:14.070 --> 16:16.437
the filing system and
my source didn't know.

16:16.439 --> 16:19.140
Somewhere along the line, there
must have been a mistake.

16:20.169 --> 16:22.143
I'm a journalist, Dr. Bull.

16:22.145 --> 16:24.979
Why would I risk my career,
my reputation,

16:24.981 --> 16:28.482
to steal tech I can't use
and don't understand?

16:29.347 --> 16:31.352
I believe you.

16:31.354 --> 16:34.221
Now we just have to find
a jury that does, too.

16:34.223 --> 16:36.490
BENNY: <i>If you discovered</i>

16:36.492 --> 16:39.660
your best friend's boyfriend
or husband was cheating on her,

16:39.662 --> 16:41.963
- would you let her know?
- That's a tricky question.

16:41.965 --> 16:43.364
Well...

16:43.366 --> 16:45.466
those are the only ones worth asking.

16:45.468 --> 16:48.102
What does that have to do with anything?

16:48.104 --> 16:51.906
It will help us predict how
much a person values the truth

16:51.908 --> 16:54.976
over the possible consequences
of reporting that truth.

16:54.978 --> 16:56.978
WOMAN: Well, the problem with that is,

16:56.980 --> 16:58.846
that could really crush my friend.

16:58.848 --> 17:00.948
Plus, it's not really my business, right?

17:00.950 --> 17:02.516
So you wouldn't tell her?

17:06.789 --> 17:10.012
We'd like to thank and excuse
juror number one, Your Honor.

17:10.693 --> 17:11.992
I got to tell him.

17:11.994 --> 17:14.462
What kind of friend would I be
if I didn't tell him?

17:16.394 --> 17:18.965
You may think you know,
but you don't know.

17:18.968 --> 17:22.470
Unless you're in the bedroom
with them, you don't know.

17:24.694 --> 17:26.640
Some things, it's better not to know.

17:26.642 --> 17:28.442
The truth is not always pretty.

17:29.657 --> 17:32.013
MARISSA: That puts us down
to our final strike, Bull,

17:32.015 --> 17:34.181
and I'm seeing two potential problems.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.250
- Talk to me.
- Juror number 19,

17:36.252 --> 17:38.085
Steven Whitaker, 42.

17:38.087 --> 17:41.355
He is a programmer who blogs
about conspiracy theories.

17:41.357 --> 17:44.125
And therefore distrusts
the mainstream media.

17:44.127 --> 17:46.093
But juror number four, Megan Palowski,

17:46.095 --> 17:48.062
happens to have met her husband
on a dating app,

17:48.064 --> 17:50.631
so will likely be sympathetic
towards Spark4U.

17:50.633 --> 17:53.167
Last one. What are you thinking, boss?

17:55.271 --> 17:56.737
Strike number four.

17:56.739 --> 17:59.473
It's gonna be hard to get
her to distrust Spark4U.

17:59.475 --> 18:01.509
And maybe our conspiracy theorist

18:01.511 --> 18:03.677
will latch on to a corporate cover-up.

18:03.679 --> 18:06.147
Your Honor, we move
to strike juror number four.

18:06.149 --> 18:09.216
Juror 19 is acceptable to the defense.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.352
Juror four, you are excused.

18:11.354 --> 18:14.321
And we have our jury.

18:14.323 --> 18:16.757
That seems like it went well.

18:16.759 --> 18:18.359
It went fine.

18:18.361 --> 18:21.729
If I were speculating, I'd say
half the jury's inclined

18:21.731 --> 18:23.898
to see things our way and half isn't.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.232
But I suppose,

18:25.234 --> 18:27.835
when the system is doing
what it's supposed to be doing,

18:27.837 --> 18:29.270
that is what you hope for.

18:29.272 --> 18:31.238
The truth is, no matter what...

18:31.240 --> 18:34.608
we've got our work cut out for us.

18:34.610 --> 18:36.277
HARTMAN: Mr. Colón.

18:36.279 --> 18:38.612
Dr. Bull. Fellas.

18:38.614 --> 18:40.781
An updated witness list.

18:46.189 --> 18:48.122
Only one change.

18:48.124 --> 18:50.890
Who the hell is Jamal Bardsley?

18:52.113 --> 18:53.928
He's an old boyfriend;
we broke up two years ago.

18:53.930 --> 18:55.629
Why would they call him?

18:55.631 --> 18:57.631
Well, according to this
interview transcript,

18:57.633 --> 19:00.134
he works for Spark4U's
biggest competitor.

19:00.136 --> 19:01.502
I had no idea.

19:01.504 --> 19:03.838
I swear I haven't talked
to the guy in two Christmases.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.940
And back then, he worked
for a telecom company.

19:05.942 --> 19:07.741
Well, be that as it may,

19:07.743 --> 19:09.977
prosecution's gonna
offer this up as proof

19:09.979 --> 19:11.979
that you had motive and means

19:11.981 --> 19:13.948
to benefit from stealing
corporate secrets.

19:13.950 --> 19:15.783
But that's not true,
and Jamal is an honest guy.

19:15.785 --> 19:17.318
He will tell them that on the stand.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.752
Well, just because he says it

19:18.754 --> 19:20.518
doesn't mean the jury's gonna believe it.

19:22.144 --> 19:24.191
How do we fix this? What do we do?

19:25.358 --> 19:27.761
Your source inside Spark4U.

19:27.763 --> 19:29.830
That's the only person who can verify

19:29.832 --> 19:32.266
what you were really after
and how you got in.

19:32.268 --> 19:34.335
Look, I would share
my correspondence with you,

19:34.337 --> 19:36.504
but we communicated through
an app called ChatErase.

19:36.506 --> 19:37.771
It automatically deletes messages

19:37.773 --> 19:39.173
once they've been viewed.

19:39.175 --> 19:40.541
Then I need a name.

19:40.543 --> 19:42.776
We need to put this person on the stand.

19:42.778 --> 19:44.211
I don't have name.

19:44.213 --> 19:46.313
They reached out to me anonymously.

19:48.045 --> 19:49.832
They must have given you
evidence to verify

19:49.834 --> 19:52.086
they were who they claimed
to be within the company.

19:52.088 --> 19:54.588
And if I can give that to
my investigator, then she can...

19:54.590 --> 19:58.125
No, Dr. Bull. My source could go to jail.

19:58.127 --> 20:00.027
That person trusted me to protect them.

20:00.029 --> 20:02.663
As a journalist,
I am only as good as my word.

20:02.665 --> 20:04.770
My career would be over if...

20:06.188 --> 20:07.401
No.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.970
I can't reveal my source to you.

20:09.972 --> 20:12.606
Even it means spending
the next 30 years in prison?

20:12.608 --> 20:16.143
Yes. That is exactly what I mean.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.766
You asked to see me, Dr. Bull?

20:22.768 --> 20:25.051
What do you know about ChatErase?

20:25.053 --> 20:26.469
ChatErase?

20:27.419 --> 20:29.386
It's a ephemeral messaging app.

20:29.388 --> 20:31.021
End-to-end encryption.

20:31.023 --> 20:33.657
The messages self-destruct as
soon as the recipient sees them.

20:33.659 --> 20:34.958
Why do you ask?

20:34.960 --> 20:36.360
So they just disappear?

20:36.362 --> 20:38.528
There's really no record
of them anywhere?

20:38.530 --> 20:39.933
The messages just vanish?

20:39.935 --> 20:42.232
Oh, well, it's the Internet.

20:42.234 --> 20:44.768
I'm guessing there's
a vestige of it somewhere,

20:44.770 --> 20:47.137
just not anywhere
you would expect to find it.

20:47.139 --> 20:48.538
So it is possible to locate them.

20:48.540 --> 20:49.673
They're out there, somewhere.

20:49.675 --> 20:51.475
Theoretically.
But the point of the technology

20:51.477 --> 20:53.310
is to make sure that doesn't happen.

20:53.312 --> 20:56.012
You would have to be an amazing
cyber sleuth to even begin...

20:56.014 --> 20:59.783
Aren't you an amazing cyber sleuth?

21:00.915 --> 21:05.188
I need those messages our client
exchanged with her source.

21:05.790 --> 21:06.890
Dr. Bull...

21:06.892 --> 21:09.059
I got to be honest...

21:09.061 --> 21:12.095
Really? Why you? Why now? No one else is.

21:13.165 --> 21:14.297
I need it done.

21:14.299 --> 21:16.533
Go, Isaiah.

21:16.535 --> 21:18.877
HARTMAN: <i>Mr. Hill,</i>

21:18.879 --> 21:21.330
what is your relationship to the accused?

21:21.332 --> 21:22.873
HILL: I am, uh...

21:22.875 --> 21:26.543
uh, was... her editor
at the <i> New York Ledger.</i>

21:26.545 --> 21:28.145
When'd you stop working for him?

21:28.147 --> 21:29.646
I didn't know I had.

21:29.648 --> 21:30.914
HARTMAN: Now, the defense

21:30.916 --> 21:32.616
is claiming that Ms. Tomlin

21:32.618 --> 21:35.652
broke into Spark4U in pursuit of a story.

21:35.654 --> 21:38.455
Is that something
that your newspaper condones?

21:38.457 --> 21:42.793
Breaking into a private business
and stealing its trade secrets?

21:42.795 --> 21:44.194
No.

21:44.196 --> 21:46.830
That's why she's been placed
on administrative leave,

21:46.832 --> 21:48.799
pending the outcome of this trial.

21:48.801 --> 21:50.867
Is this the first you've heard of this?

21:50.869 --> 21:52.569
HARTMAN: Ms. Tomlin is accused

21:52.571 --> 21:54.604
of stealing proprietary code.

21:54.606 --> 21:56.540
Could you explain to all of us

21:56.542 --> 21:58.675
what that could possibly have to do

21:58.677 --> 22:01.044
with her alleged Spark4U exposé?

22:01.046 --> 22:03.079
Objection! Speculation.

22:03.081 --> 22:04.195
Sustained.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.657
Let me rephrase.

22:05.659 --> 22:07.851
What was Ms. Tomlin's story about?

22:12.825 --> 22:15.225
I-I actually...

22:15.227 --> 22:18.428
never assigned Chloe
a story about Spark4U.

22:18.430 --> 22:20.430
And, uh,

22:20.432 --> 22:22.866
she never mentioned to me
that she was interested

22:22.868 --> 22:24.534
in pursuing one on her own.

22:26.405 --> 22:28.505
He's lying. He's just lying.

22:28.507 --> 22:30.707
We were gonna publish it three days ago.

22:30.709 --> 22:32.142
I don't understand.

22:32.144 --> 22:33.577
HARTMAN: So is it possible

22:33.579 --> 22:35.245
that she made the whole thing up

22:35.247 --> 22:37.113
as an excuse for committing this crime?

22:37.115 --> 22:38.982
- Objection!
- Sustained.

22:38.984 --> 22:40.851
Ms. Hartman.

22:40.853 --> 22:42.385
Withdrawn, Your Honor.

22:43.956 --> 22:46.189
BENNY: I don't need a mirror jury

22:46.191 --> 22:47.891
to know that this is killing us.

22:56.134 --> 22:58.001
Chloe?

22:58.003 --> 22:59.936
Who are you?

23:00.946 --> 23:03.195
You don't understand. I had no choice.

23:03.197 --> 23:04.589
It came down from the masthead.

23:04.591 --> 23:05.909
They threatened to lay off
half the department.

23:05.911 --> 23:07.110
Once this blows over...

23:07.112 --> 23:08.879
Go to hell, Tom.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.114
Wait a minute.

23:11.116 --> 23:12.849
You're saying that the publishers

23:12.851 --> 23:15.051
of the <i> New York Ledger</i>
told you to perjure yourself?

23:15.053 --> 23:16.753
I'm not saying anything of the kind.

23:16.755 --> 23:17.873
BULL: As I recall,

23:17.875 --> 23:19.706
one of the owners of the <i> Ledger</i>
made his fortune

23:19.708 --> 23:21.224
in tech startups and apps.

23:21.226 --> 23:23.193
I have no idea.

23:23.195 --> 23:24.882
I just work there.

23:24.884 --> 23:27.531
Ah, money... the enemy of truth.

23:27.533 --> 23:29.599
Ah, truth.

23:29.601 --> 23:31.368
Yes, I remember truth.

23:31.370 --> 23:35.071
It existed a long time ago
in a galaxy far, far away.

23:35.073 --> 23:38.074
Come on, Yoda. Let's
head back to the office.

23:44.149 --> 23:46.483
I'm sorry, sir.
Perhaps you didn't hear me.

23:46.485 --> 23:49.085
I announced last call an hour ago.

23:49.087 --> 23:50.987
Leave me alone.

23:50.989 --> 23:53.189
I'm pondering.

23:56.662 --> 24:01.431
I'm sure you are, but friends
don't let friends ponder drunk.

24:01.433 --> 24:03.425
Hmm.

24:04.002 --> 24:06.262
God, the world stinks.

24:07.105 --> 24:10.273
Her boss actually got on the
stand and told a boldface lie,

24:10.275 --> 24:12.242
sold her right down the river,

24:12.244 --> 24:14.603
then went to Chloe and admitted it.

24:15.514 --> 24:17.681
I don't know which was worse...

24:18.274 --> 24:20.743
watching him ruin her life under oath,

24:20.745 --> 24:23.453
or watching him crush her spirit
with the truth,

24:23.455 --> 24:26.656
'cause he thought
that'd make it all better.

24:30.629 --> 24:33.029
I don't know what to do for this girl.

24:33.031 --> 24:36.099
I mean, she won't tell me her source.

24:36.750 --> 24:39.193
The people she works for
won't stand up for her.

24:39.195 --> 24:41.104
It's like that movie with George Clooney,

24:41.106 --> 24:43.373
the one where he's on a boat and
everything that can go wrong...

24:43.375 --> 24:45.141
<i>- The Perfect Storm?</i>
- Right.

24:45.143 --> 24:46.276
Except I can't decide

24:46.278 --> 24:47.944
if I'm George Clooney or Mark Wahlberg.

24:47.946 --> 24:49.512
I just had a crazy thought.

24:49.514 --> 24:51.214
Ooh. I love crazy thoughts.

24:51.216 --> 24:52.515
This closed courtroom

24:52.517 --> 24:54.066
is making me nuts.

24:54.068 --> 24:56.480
No mirror jurors, no way for me to help.

24:56.482 --> 24:58.406
But then it occurred to me,

24:58.408 --> 25:00.890
if the courtroom is really closed,

25:00.892 --> 25:04.327
maybe the victims that reached
out to Chloe would be willing

25:04.329 --> 25:06.529
to testify on her behalf.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.666
I know they're embarrassed
about what happened to them.

25:09.668 --> 25:11.568
I'm sure they'd rather stay anonymous,

25:11.570 --> 25:13.470
but under the circumstances,

25:13.472 --> 25:16.640
maybe they would be willing to
talk about how they went to her

25:16.642 --> 25:18.642
to help try and expose this thing.

25:18.644 --> 25:22.278
Young lady, has anyone
ever called you a genius?

25:22.280 --> 25:24.881
No. I don't think so.

25:24.883 --> 25:26.049
Well, wait till it happens.

25:26.051 --> 25:27.684
You'll see. It's a great feeling.

25:29.287 --> 25:31.721
And that is a terrific idea.

25:31.723 --> 25:34.190
Jury keeps looking at Chloe as a criminal

25:34.192 --> 25:36.626
'cause we can't get anyone
to testify otherwise.

25:36.628 --> 25:40.363
But if the jury gets a look at
who she was really fighting for,

25:40.365 --> 25:42.499
we got a shot at changing their minds.

25:42.501 --> 25:44.200
You're a genius.

25:44.202 --> 25:46.836
Man, that feels great.

25:46.838 --> 25:48.905
I'm gonna make some calls

25:48.907 --> 25:51.574
and see if I can round up
some of the girls.

25:51.576 --> 25:53.910
Now that I know you're not
closing the place up,

25:53.912 --> 25:55.746
I'm gonna do some more pondering.

26:00.065 --> 26:02.232
See how that worked out?

26:16.003 --> 26:17.131
It's 2:00 in the morning.

26:17.133 --> 26:18.753
Why do you keep ringing my buzzer?

26:18.755 --> 26:20.834
I'm sorry. My name is Isaiah.

26:20.834 --> 26:22.501
You don't know me, but I'm the guy

26:22.503 --> 26:24.322
who got your job at TAC,
and I really need your help.

26:24.324 --> 26:26.772
You the flying coffee guy?

26:26.904 --> 26:28.804
You know what a cheap trick
that is, right?

26:32.449 --> 26:34.777
Is that Chloe's laptop?

26:36.854 --> 26:38.464
All right, give me a second.

26:39.277 --> 26:42.017
Near as I can figure, there are
two ways we can do this.

26:42.019 --> 26:44.153
One is to find
the ChatErase encryption key

26:44.155 --> 26:45.654
on Chloe's computer.

26:45.656 --> 26:50.125
The other is to locate
a covert third-party app

26:50.127 --> 26:51.827
that spies on ChatErase in the hopes

26:51.829 --> 26:53.862
of profiting from leaking secrets.

26:53.864 --> 26:56.899
One has to exist.
We just have to find it.

26:56.901 --> 26:59.335
That's...

26:59.337 --> 27:01.870
I hadn't thought of that.

27:03.574 --> 27:06.041
You know if this works,
I'll tell Dr. Bull it was you.

27:06.043 --> 27:08.177
The hell you will.

27:08.179 --> 27:10.846
Do you know how many people
use that Spark4U app every day?

27:10.848 --> 27:12.081
No.

27:12.083 --> 27:15.887
16 million. That's 16 million
people every day

27:15.889 --> 27:17.207
who might be setting up a date

27:17.209 --> 27:18.920
with someone who's going to hurt them.

27:18.922 --> 27:20.755
So you will not tell Dr. Bull
it was me, okay?

27:20.757 --> 27:22.391
I don't want him to miss the message

27:22.393 --> 27:23.859
because he's mad at the messenger.

27:23.861 --> 27:25.494
Just too important.

27:26.977 --> 27:28.197
BRIDGET: <i>At a certain point,</i>

27:28.199 --> 27:30.699
I just stopped fighting,
'cause he was bigger than me.

27:30.701 --> 27:32.801
It was like I was floating above myself,

27:32.803 --> 27:34.932
like I wasn't even there.

27:34.934 --> 27:37.706
And when the assault was over,
did you go to the police?

27:37.708 --> 27:41.076
No. Probably should have.

27:41.078 --> 27:43.178
But I couldn't think.

27:43.180 --> 27:46.515
I just wanted him off me. Wanted it done.

27:47.693 --> 27:49.551
I ran home.

27:49.553 --> 27:51.553
Took a shower.

27:51.555 --> 27:54.089
Hottest shower.

27:54.091 --> 27:57.359
I got in bed, I crawled under the covers.

27:59.930 --> 28:02.598
I just wanted to die.

28:02.600 --> 28:06.535
Your Honor, I would be remiss if
I didn't object on relevance.

28:06.537 --> 28:08.070
Sit down, Ms. Hartman.

28:08.072 --> 28:09.736
You may continue.

28:09.738 --> 28:11.231
BRIDGET: That's it really.

28:11.233 --> 28:12.808
By the time I went to the police,

28:12.810 --> 28:14.576
his profile was off the app.

28:14.578 --> 28:16.278
And the people at Spark4U claimed

28:16.280 --> 28:17.980
they had no way of finding him.

28:17.982 --> 28:19.715
There wasn't much anybody could do.

28:20.410 --> 28:22.718
And that's when you decided
to seek Ms. Tomlin,

28:22.720 --> 28:24.555
- the defendant?
- BRIDGET: Yes.

28:24.557 --> 28:26.570
Um, I had heard from another girl

28:26.572 --> 28:27.783
that she was writing an article

28:27.785 --> 28:30.993
on Spark4U about
the people who use the app,

28:30.995 --> 28:34.296
and about how the company
was turning a blind eye

28:34.298 --> 28:37.533
to the assaults, so I thought,
“I have to share this.”

28:37.535 --> 28:39.701
And this was after
you approached the company?

28:39.703 --> 28:42.237
Well, after the police
approached the company,

28:42.239 --> 28:44.740
after the police hit a dead end.

28:44.742 --> 28:48.811
And after I talked to Ms.
Tomlin, I took one more shot.

28:48.813 --> 28:52.181
I personally went to Spark4U for help.

28:53.451 --> 28:55.717
But they didn't seem very interested.

28:55.719 --> 28:58.654
They just wanted my word
that I would stop going online

28:58.656 --> 29:00.155
onto the victims' forums,

29:00.157 --> 29:02.524
and that I would stop talking
to Ms. Tomlin.

29:02.526 --> 29:03.759
How do you mean?

29:06.311 --> 29:07.729
Um...

29:08.730 --> 29:10.265
I know that signing
a nondisclosure agreement

29:10.267 --> 29:11.633
means you can't discuss

29:11.635 --> 29:12.835
certain things,

29:12.837 --> 29:14.603
but am I allowed
to discuss the NDA itself?

29:14.605 --> 29:15.871
Objection, Your Honor!

29:15.873 --> 29:17.072
BENNY: Are you testifying that

29:17.074 --> 29:19.408
- Spark4U had you sign an NDA?
- Your Honor?

29:19.410 --> 29:20.809
- In return for what?
- Your Honor!

29:20.811 --> 29:22.535
They paid me.

29:25.816 --> 29:28.250
Marissa, I ever tell you you're a genius?

29:28.792 --> 29:30.252
Oh, wait. That's right. You're not here.

29:30.254 --> 29:31.453
HARTMAN: Objection!

29:31.455 --> 29:32.955
Your Honor, I request to be heard.

29:32.957 --> 29:34.490
Order!

29:34.492 --> 29:35.958
Counsel, sidebar.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.127
Your Honor, Bridget Means
signed a binding

29:38.129 --> 29:41.363
nondisclosure agreement as part
of a settlement with Spark4U.

29:41.365 --> 29:44.333
Now, however much this might
frustrate the defense,

29:44.335 --> 29:45.667
she is not legally allowed

29:45.669 --> 29:47.302
to discuss her dealings with the company.

29:47.304 --> 29:49.338
Your Honor, this is
a criminal proceeding.

29:49.340 --> 29:51.854
Any civil contract should be voided

29:51.856 --> 29:53.775
if it's preventing the court
from hearing the truth.

29:53.777 --> 29:56.798
All well and good, Mr. Colón,
but the witness's dealings

29:56.800 --> 29:58.850
with the company are not
on trial at the moment.

29:58.852 --> 30:00.015
BULL: No,

30:00.017 --> 30:02.535
but they are material in
explaining our client's actions.

30:02.537 --> 30:03.746
Your Honor,

30:03.748 --> 30:04.987
this NDA

30:04.989 --> 30:07.356
was meant to protect Spark4U
from defamation.

30:07.358 --> 30:10.325
This courtroom is closed
at Spark4U's request.

30:10.327 --> 30:12.773
Bridget Means's testimony

30:12.775 --> 30:16.331
is not public, and therefore
can't harm the company.

30:16.333 --> 30:19.001
Dr. Bull makes a very good point.

30:19.003 --> 30:20.536
I will allow testimony.

30:20.538 --> 30:24.439
The witness may discuss her
settlement and other dealings

30:24.441 --> 30:25.741
with Spark4U.

30:26.507 --> 30:28.006
BENNY: <i>Good day.</i>

30:28.031 --> 30:29.597
Important day.

30:29.749 --> 30:31.087
Her idea.

30:31.089 --> 30:33.515
Oh, shucks. You're making me blush.

30:33.517 --> 30:35.851
Well, stop blushing. We're not there yet.

30:35.853 --> 30:37.853
Bridget's testimony was helpful,

30:37.855 --> 30:40.789
but it doesn't disprove the
prosecutor's version of events

30:40.791 --> 30:42.879
that Chloe broke into
their place of business

30:42.881 --> 30:44.404
to steal proprietary information.

30:44.406 --> 30:45.761
ISAIAH: Dr. Bull?

30:45.763 --> 30:48.597
Uh, sorry to interrupt,

30:48.599 --> 30:51.600
but I had a kind of breakthrough.

30:51.602 --> 30:53.374
These are

30:53.376 --> 30:54.903
the printouts of Chloe's text messages

30:54.905 --> 30:56.510
with her anonymous source.

30:57.766 --> 30:58.863
You got them?

30:58.865 --> 31:01.245
MARISSA: Well, how? I thought
you said it was impossible.

31:01.247 --> 31:03.433
Uh, I don't know what to tell you.

31:03.435 --> 31:05.813
I really thought
it couldn't be done, either.

31:05.815 --> 31:07.716
Turns out I was wrong.

31:09.887 --> 31:12.588
Well, this is great.

31:12.590 --> 31:15.057
All right.

31:15.059 --> 31:16.892
Introduce them into evidence tomorrow.

31:16.894 --> 31:19.428
This will support our theory
that Chloe didn't break in,

31:19.430 --> 31:21.463
someone from Spark4U let her in.

31:21.465 --> 31:24.783
Well, actually, that's not true, either.

31:25.102 --> 31:27.069
- What do you mean?
- I mean, her source

31:27.071 --> 31:30.305
wasn't someone inside Spark4U;
it was someone with a computer

31:30.307 --> 31:32.858
registered to a company called GoldLark.

31:32.860 --> 31:35.939
GoldLark?
They're a private security firm.

31:35.941 --> 31:39.673
Paramilitary, spies, fixers.

31:39.675 --> 31:41.044
Why would a whistle-blower

31:41.046 --> 31:44.198
from Spark4U hire a private security firm

31:44.200 --> 31:45.954
to leak information?

31:45.956 --> 31:49.258
They wouldn't. Doesn't make sense.

31:49.260 --> 31:51.026
But what does make sense...

31:55.897 --> 31:57.599
What if Chloe's source wasn't a source?

31:57.601 --> 32:01.156
What if Spark4U got wind of Chloe's story

32:01.158 --> 32:03.205
and hired a fixer from GoldLark

32:03.207 --> 32:07.309
to impersonate a concerned
whistle-blower to entrap her,

32:07.311 --> 32:09.884
ensure she was caught with trade secrets

32:09.886 --> 32:12.453
so they could get a gag order
and lock her up,

32:12.455 --> 32:14.640
keep the story from ever seeing
the light of day?

32:14.642 --> 32:16.418
Wow, that is really dark.

32:16.420 --> 32:18.787
What kind of a mind thinks that way?

32:19.713 --> 32:21.189
Well, I just did.

32:22.359 --> 32:23.659
So they set her up?

32:23.661 --> 32:25.727
Looks that way.

32:26.344 --> 32:29.331
And now it's our job to knock 'em down.

32:29.333 --> 32:32.042
We were able to track
the messages from GoldLark

32:32.044 --> 32:33.722
to a woman named Jessa Northrop.

32:33.724 --> 32:36.638
She's ex-CIA. Now she works as a fixer.

32:36.640 --> 32:40.171
My guess is, after she delivered
the key card,

32:40.173 --> 32:42.230
she had Spark4U change
the security protocols

32:42.232 --> 32:43.650
so you'd get caught.

32:43.652 --> 32:47.209
So, the numbers were never
for the files I wanted.

32:47.211 --> 32:48.884
They were always gonna lead me to data

32:48.886 --> 32:52.754
that was gonna make it look like
I was there to steal ideas.

32:52.756 --> 32:56.124
How did I let this happen?
I vetted that source for weeks.

32:56.126 --> 32:57.726
What did I miss?

32:57.728 --> 32:59.227
Maybe nothing.

32:59.229 --> 33:01.496
Maybe it was next to impossible.

33:01.498 --> 33:04.232
I mean, my team barely detected the ruse.

33:04.234 --> 33:07.413
And this Jessa Northrop person
was clearly being fed

33:07.415 --> 33:09.304
real information from someone
within the company.

33:09.306 --> 33:13.156
They were willing to throw
me in jail to shut me up?

33:14.559 --> 33:17.312
The good news is we got
a subpoena for Jessa Northrop.

33:17.314 --> 33:19.247
And I'm hoping, after she testifies,

33:19.249 --> 33:21.817
the jury will start
to see that this wasn't

33:21.819 --> 33:23.919
about a crime you committed.

33:23.921 --> 33:26.772
It was about a cover-up
you were trying to expose.

33:27.948 --> 33:29.524
BENNY: <i>Ms. Northrop, do you work</i>

33:29.526 --> 33:31.360
for the private security firm, GoldLark?

33:31.362 --> 33:32.527
I do.

33:32.529 --> 33:35.997
Does GoldLark contract out
to private companies

33:35.999 --> 33:40.569
in all manner of investigative
and intelligence work,

33:40.571 --> 33:41.970
covert and otherwise?

33:41.972 --> 33:43.205
Yes.

33:43.207 --> 33:44.573
And can you confirm for me

33:44.575 --> 33:46.441
that Spark4U Enterprises

33:46.443 --> 33:49.044
has contracted with GoldLark in the past?

33:49.046 --> 33:50.445
I can't speak to the past.

33:50.447 --> 33:52.514
I only began working there
six months ago.

33:52.516 --> 33:55.784
In the time that you have
worked at GoldLark,

33:55.786 --> 33:57.919
has Spark4U hired you

33:57.921 --> 34:00.105
to do a job for them?

34:08.011 --> 34:09.129
Your Honor, I'd like

34:09.130 --> 34:10.601
to exercise my Fifth Amendment rights

34:10.603 --> 34:11.933
against self-incrimination.

34:11.935 --> 34:13.902
Ask another question, Mr. Colón.

34:13.904 --> 34:15.737
BENNY: Ms. Northrop,

34:15.739 --> 34:18.672
did Spark4U hire you
to impersonate an employee

34:18.675 --> 34:20.375
and reach out to my client,

34:20.377 --> 34:21.877
Chloe Tomlin,

34:21.879 --> 34:24.079
and convince her to break into Spark4U?

34:24.081 --> 34:25.480
I plead the Fifth.

34:25.482 --> 34:27.331
Is it your intention, ma'am,

34:27.333 --> 34:29.751
to take the Fifth
on all further questioning?

34:29.753 --> 34:30.819
It is.

34:30.821 --> 34:32.587
Then you're excused.

34:41.605 --> 34:43.165
We were so close.

34:43.167 --> 34:45.600
We got her on the stand.

34:45.601 --> 34:48.136
The jury knows she's guilty of something.

34:48.138 --> 34:50.871
They just don't know what.

34:50.873 --> 34:53.708
Unless we can find a way
to prove that Chloe was set up,

34:53.710 --> 34:55.177
to explain what really happened,

34:55.179 --> 34:57.946
all we'll have is a jury
filled with a lot of

34:57.948 --> 34:59.981
doubt and confusion.

34:59.983 --> 35:03.452
And doubts and confusion
won't keep Chloe out of jail.

35:04.044 --> 35:05.921
So, I had a crazy thought.

35:05.923 --> 35:07.823
- Another one?
- I just keep thinking

35:07.825 --> 35:09.491
about that key card.

35:09.493 --> 35:11.793
The one that Chloe used
to get into Spark4U.

35:11.795 --> 35:13.460
- What about it?
- Well, if her source

35:13.462 --> 35:16.031
wasn't an actual Spark4U employee,

35:16.033 --> 35:18.133
how did this fixer get the card?

35:18.135 --> 35:20.268
Someone had to give it to her, right?

35:20.270 --> 35:22.637
Someone from inside the company.

35:22.639 --> 35:25.640
Marissa. Anyone ever told you
you're a genius?

35:25.642 --> 35:28.810
No. Never. Not once. Not ever.

35:32.589 --> 35:34.569
Do you solemnly swear or affirm...

35:34.623 --> 35:35.722
Like I told you,

35:35.724 --> 35:37.491
never trust a man in a skinny tie.

35:37.493 --> 35:39.526
- ...to the best of your knowledge?
- I do.

35:44.299 --> 35:46.133
Mr. Gatewood.

35:47.603 --> 35:51.538
So, you are the founder

35:51.540 --> 35:55.208
and CEO of Spark4U, the dating app?

35:55.210 --> 35:57.611
- Yes, I am.
- If I may ask,

35:57.613 --> 36:01.214
what's your company worth
at the moment? In round numbers.

36:01.216 --> 36:02.816
- In round numbers?
- Mm-hmm.

36:02.818 --> 36:08.088
Our IPO last year was valued
at approximately $3.3 billion.

36:08.090 --> 36:09.956
Wow.

36:09.958 --> 36:14.255
Who-who knew that matchmaking
could be so lucrative, huh?

36:15.930 --> 36:18.365
Please keep your musings
to yourself, Mr. Colón.

36:18.367 --> 36:20.500
I apologize, Your Honor.

36:20.502 --> 36:23.437
Now, Mr. Gatewood, did you know that

36:23.439 --> 36:27.407
the defendant, Chloe Tomlin,
was working on a story about

36:27.409 --> 36:29.076
the alleged cover-up regarding

36:29.078 --> 36:31.511
your company's response
to sexual assaults?

36:31.513 --> 36:33.980
I did not, but I can assure you

36:33.982 --> 36:36.516
that we take all such incidents
very seriously.

36:36.518 --> 36:38.485
The safety of our users is

36:38.487 --> 36:40.687
the company's primary concern.

36:40.689 --> 36:43.190
That's very admirable.

36:45.478 --> 36:46.927
Mr. Gatewood, is it true

36:46.929 --> 36:50.711
that your assistant had
a new key card made for you

36:50.713 --> 36:52.265
on the day that

36:52.267 --> 36:55.535
Ms. Tomlin allegedly broke into Spark4U?

36:55.537 --> 36:57.838
I...

36:57.840 --> 37:00.907
don't remember the exact date,

37:00.909 --> 37:04.077
but I do recall losing my security card

37:04.079 --> 37:06.506
around that time and
needing another one made, yes.

37:06.508 --> 37:08.982
So, presumably, you've been
using this replacement card

37:08.984 --> 37:11.051
to get into your office
for the last several weeks,

37:11.053 --> 37:12.230
is that correct?

37:12.232 --> 37:13.720
I would assume so.

37:13.722 --> 37:15.622
I mean, my key card is not something

37:15.624 --> 37:17.244
I pay a lot of attention to.

37:17.246 --> 37:20.026
It's a simple question,
Mr. Gatewood. Yes or no?

37:26.196 --> 37:28.301
Answer the question, Mr. Gatewood.

37:29.875 --> 37:31.156
No.

37:31.408 --> 37:34.608
I lost the replacement card
you're referring to as well.

37:34.610 --> 37:37.210
On the very day I got it,
as a matter of fact.

37:37.212 --> 37:39.279
That's interesting.

37:39.281 --> 37:41.314
Because...

37:41.316 --> 37:44.785
your security department records

37:44.787 --> 37:47.788
indicate that no additional key cards

37:47.790 --> 37:51.525
were made for you
since the day of the break-in.

37:52.361 --> 37:55.328
So, if you lost your replacement card,

37:55.757 --> 37:58.131
then how are you getting
into the building?

37:58.133 --> 38:00.500
I've been using my assistant's card.

38:00.502 --> 38:04.004
Then how has he or she
been getting into the building?

38:06.317 --> 38:08.675
I see you're struggling
with this, Mr. Gatewood.

38:08.677 --> 38:10.710
Let me give you a hand.

38:10.712 --> 38:14.047
Is it possible that you never
actually lost your key card?

38:14.049 --> 38:16.342
That this replacement card you had made

38:16.344 --> 38:19.019
was so that you'd have one
to give to Jessa Northrop?

38:19.021 --> 38:21.021
Objection! Your Honor, argumentative.

38:21.023 --> 38:23.824
Speculative. And the defense
is badgering the witness.

38:23.826 --> 38:25.959
- So she'd have one...
- Mr. Colón!

38:25.961 --> 38:27.494
...to deliver to my client,

38:27.496 --> 38:28.709
- who thought...
- Mr. Colón!

38:28.734 --> 38:29.796
She was a whistle-blower,

38:29.798 --> 38:32.899
when, in fact, this was all
a plan to incriminate her

38:32.901 --> 38:34.868
- so she could never publish
- Mr. Colón!

38:34.870 --> 38:36.371
Her damning story about your company?

38:36.373 --> 38:38.038
Mr. Colón!

38:38.907 --> 38:40.307
I will have order.

38:40.309 --> 38:44.177
Mr. Colón, you are dangerously
close to being in contempt.

38:44.597 --> 38:47.380
Ms. Hartman's objections are sustained.

38:47.382 --> 38:50.350
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, you are to disregard

38:50.352 --> 38:52.118
the defense's assertions.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.820
'Cause that works.

38:53.822 --> 38:57.023
This is normally the time
I ask Marissa back in TAC

38:57.025 --> 38:59.292
what the jury is telling us, but...

39:00.762 --> 39:02.963
...Stevie Wonder could read this jury.

39:02.965 --> 39:06.867
We, the jury, find
the accused, Chloe Tomlin,

39:06.869 --> 39:08.835
not guilty on all counts.

39:08.837 --> 39:11.738
Oh. Thank you.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.640
I can't thank you enough.

39:13.642 --> 39:17.043
I know I talk a big game,
but I was terrified of prison.

39:18.013 --> 39:19.613
Glad we could help.

39:21.759 --> 39:23.817
How do I ever make this up to you?

39:23.819 --> 39:26.486
How do I ever... repay you?

39:26.488 --> 39:28.755
You publish that article,

39:28.757 --> 39:30.357
someplace you feel good about,

39:30.359 --> 39:32.525
someplace that feels good about you,

39:32.527 --> 39:35.195
and then you write a few thousand more.

39:35.197 --> 39:36.663
Deal.

39:42.004 --> 39:43.737
There she is.

39:43.739 --> 39:46.740
Hey. I was reading about everything.

39:46.742 --> 39:48.742
It's pretty exciting, huh?

39:48.744 --> 39:50.343
Thanks for making it happen.

39:50.345 --> 39:52.412
You're welcome.

39:52.414 --> 39:56.216
Actually, I think Chloe has
you to thank more than anyone.

39:56.218 --> 40:00.353
If it weren't for you, TAC would
have never gotten involved.

40:00.355 --> 40:01.988
I don't know.

40:01.990 --> 40:03.256
Oh, I do.

40:03.258 --> 40:06.359
Besides, if you end up
deciding to go to NYU,

40:06.361 --> 40:09.062
I think you're staring
at an “A” in her class.

40:10.666 --> 40:14.270
Yeah, well, I haven't
made a decision yet.

40:16.605 --> 40:19.873
Listen, I get it.

40:19.875 --> 40:21.875
I know you're angry.

40:21.877 --> 40:24.010
And I'm sorry about that.

40:24.012 --> 40:26.212
I know you don't agree with the way

40:26.214 --> 40:29.015
your mother and I handled
things all those years.

40:31.579 --> 40:33.353
But...

40:33.355 --> 40:36.556
don't turn your back on this city,

40:36.558 --> 40:39.125
on this amazing opportunity,

40:39.127 --> 40:41.328
on this fantastic university,

40:41.330 --> 40:44.431
just because this is where I live.

40:45.934 --> 40:48.435
We can work on things and keep talking.

40:48.437 --> 40:52.038
We can not keep talking
if your heart is not into it.

40:52.040 --> 40:54.441
But just don't close any doors.

40:54.443 --> 40:56.042
Not yet.

40:56.044 --> 40:58.378
I'm not closing any doors.

40:58.380 --> 41:01.815
And I'm not turning my back on the city.

41:01.817 --> 41:03.583
Or NYU.

41:03.585 --> 41:04.918
It's just...

41:04.920 --> 41:07.754
Mom overnighted me this yesterday.

41:07.756 --> 41:09.923
What's this?

41:12.160 --> 41:14.427
Columbia?

41:17.599 --> 41:19.632
You got accepted at Columbia?

41:21.303 --> 41:23.636
And another scholarship?!

41:23.638 --> 41:25.805
Baby, come here.

41:27.642 --> 41:29.971
I am so proud of you.

41:31.146 --> 41:33.213
This doesn't mean we're okay.

41:34.282 --> 41:36.216
'Cause...

41:36.218 --> 41:38.752
I'm coming back
to see Columbia next month,

41:38.754 --> 41:41.065
and I need a place to stay.

41:41.623 --> 41:45.325
And I find this car and driver
very impressive.

41:47.129 --> 41:49.429
I'll be sure to tell my boss.

41:54.102 --> 41:57.404
BULL: Good afternoon.
I'm your wake-up call.

41:57.406 --> 41:59.906
It's 4:30 in the afternoon.

41:59.908 --> 42:01.574
Hi, Dr. Bull.

42:01.576 --> 42:04.677
You went behind my back once
and ended up in jail.

42:04.679 --> 42:07.914
Why on earth would you think
it's a good idea to do it again?

42:08.301 --> 42:11.084
I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

42:11.086 --> 42:14.354
You're a very bad liar, Cable.

42:14.356 --> 42:17.557
It's actually one of
your more endearing qualities.

42:17.559 --> 42:20.627
You figured out how to recover
Chloe Tomlin's text messages,

42:20.629 --> 42:21.961
didn't you?

42:34.309 --> 42:36.142
