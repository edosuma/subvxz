00:21.770 --> 00:23.773
I've been living with a secret
for a long time.

00:26.258 --> 00:28.261
And I haven't been able to
share it with anyone.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.466
But someone has found out.

00:36.112 --> 00:38.275
It's dangerous for anyone
to know the truth about me.

00:42.321 --> 00:44.785
And it's not just them
I'm worried about.

00:44.885 --> 00:46.187
There is someone else
in his life

00:46.287 --> 00:48.290
that's more precious.

00:50.693 --> 00:52.696
And vulnerable.

00:57.944 --> 00:59.947
How can I trust this person
now that they know who I am?

01:03.192 --> 01:05.195
Thanks, M.

01:09.842 --> 01:13.588
Dear M,
thank you for your question.

01:13.688 --> 01:17.593
Let me ask you a question
in return.

01:17.693 --> 01:19.696
How much longer could you
go on keeping this secret?

01:22.060 --> 01:24.063
Maybe it was uncovered
for a reason.

01:26.146 --> 01:28.149
Too many of us
choose the path of fear.

01:31.154 --> 01:33.097
It's easier to take that path

01:33.197 --> 01:35.200
because it's
the path of least resistance.

01:39.726 --> 01:41.950
But if you take that path,
you will fail.

01:45.455 --> 01:47.458
So why not take the other path?

01:52.305 --> 01:54.307
At least now
you won't die wondering
about what might happen.

01:57.271 --> 02:00.698
And who knows?

02:00.798 --> 02:02.801
Maybe it can give you
the chance to live.

02:04.643 --> 02:06.106
Always, Adelaide.

02:06.206 --> 02:08.209
Are you there?

02:14.178 --> 02:15.720
I couldn't...

02:15.820 --> 02:17.723
get away.

02:17.823 --> 02:20.567
The shutters are a backup.
They...

02:20.667 --> 02:23.011
They open
when I unlock this door.

02:23.111 --> 02:25.094
I'm going... I'm going to
unlock this door now.

02:25.194 --> 02:28.259
Wait...

02:28.359 --> 02:30.362
How do I know you're not s...
still that thing?

02:31.443 --> 02:33.446
Do I sound like I am?

02:37.452 --> 02:39.454
You're... You're just
going to have to trust me.

02:43.702 --> 02:45.765
How the fuck

02:45.865 --> 02:47.868
can I trust you?

03:11.903 --> 03:14.367
This is me.

03:14.467 --> 03:16.210
This is...

03:16.310 --> 03:18.313
This is who I am.

03:25.964 --> 03:28.669
♪ If I had a tail

03:28.769 --> 03:31.813
♪ I'd own the night

03:34.778 --> 03:37.321
♪ If I had a tail

03:37.421 --> 03:40.346
♪ I'd swat the flies

03:56.850 --> 03:58.273
You don't
have to have that there.

03:58.373 --> 04:00.556
Don't I?

04:00.656 --> 04:02.199
How do I know you won't turn..?

04:02.299 --> 04:05.003
It doesn't work that way, Gary.

04:05.103 --> 04:08.648
Well, I would prefer

04:08.748 --> 04:10.691
if it stays between us
for the minute.

04:10.791 --> 04:12.534
Are you going to tell anyone?

04:12.634 --> 04:14.457
- Tell anyone what?
- What you saw.

04:14.557 --> 04:16.560
Who would believe me?

04:18.803 --> 04:21.606
I've spent the entire evening
wondering if I'm going crazy.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.794
- You're not crazy.
- Why?

04:25.894 --> 04:28.117
- Why?
- Why did you do that?

04:28.217 --> 04:29.960
Honestly, I can't help it.

04:30.060 --> 04:32.063
Have you always done that?

04:33.345 --> 04:35.148
No. No, I was...

04:37.251 --> 04:39.334
I was bit by a dog
when we were in Prague.

04:39.433 --> 04:41.217
We?

04:41.317 --> 04:43.058
My husband, David, and I.

04:43.159 --> 04:45.162
The husband that died.

04:47.966 --> 04:50.450
How did your husband die?

04:55.418 --> 04:57.481
We were in Prague
and I got bit by a dog -

04:57.581 --> 05:01.206
at least,
I thought it was a dog.

05:01.306 --> 05:03.410
It was hard to tell, 'cause
we were both really high.

05:03.510 --> 05:05.533
We'd taken Molly.

05:05.633 --> 05:08.016
I haven't done drugs since,

05:08.116 --> 05:10.260
in case you think
I have a drug problem too.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.022
I'm going to get water.

05:31.752 --> 05:33.755
You can put the knife down.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.463
What was I saying?

05:39.563 --> 05:41.066
You were taking drugs in Prague
and a dog bit you.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.269
Yeah. A dog bit me.

05:43.369 --> 05:44.831
It took a chunk
right out of my arm,

05:44.931 --> 05:47.315
which is how I got this.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.078
And that's why
I always wear long sleeves,

05:49.178 --> 05:50.600
in case you're wondering.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.202
- Hadn't noticed.
- Mmm.

05:52.302 --> 05:54.125
Guys never notice those things.

05:54.225 --> 05:56.649
Anyway, I got really sick,

05:56.749 --> 05:58.692
and they gave me
antibiotics and shots

05:58.792 --> 06:00.855
and David wanted to
call the trip off,

06:00.955 --> 06:02.618
but I didn't,
I wanted to stay and...

06:02.718 --> 06:05.903
Are you getting to the point?

06:06.003 --> 06:07.465
I'm sorry, would you like me
to jump ahead

06:07.565 --> 06:09.568
to when my husband
was torn apart?

06:12.893 --> 06:14.896
OK. So...

06:16.538 --> 06:18.481
It was our last night
in Prague,

06:18.581 --> 06:20.925
and David's favourite band
were playing.

06:21.025 --> 06:22.527
And I told you
how I feel about music,

06:22.627 --> 06:24.490
but this was something else -

06:24.590 --> 06:26.533
that time, in that place,

06:26.633 --> 06:29.257
feeling the sound
from that band,

06:29.356 --> 06:31.140
the power in that moment.

06:31.240 --> 06:34.786
Everything was perfect.

06:34.886 --> 06:37.289
And it was the last time
that anything was perfect.

06:44.099 --> 06:46.102
'Cause I turned into a wolf
and I ate him.

06:49.788 --> 06:52.332
You ate him.

06:52.432 --> 06:54.335
The wolf did.

06:54.435 --> 06:56.498
At the concert?

06:56.598 --> 06:58.601
I don't know where.

06:59.923 --> 07:02.066
I woke up in the woods and...

07:02.166 --> 07:04.550
And he was gone.

07:04.650 --> 07:07.594
I went to the police, and...

07:07.694 --> 07:11.240
I was covered in his blood,
so I became a suspect.

07:11.340 --> 07:14.004
They said he'd been attacked
by a wild animal,

07:14.104 --> 07:15.246
and they thought
I couldn't remember it

07:15.346 --> 07:18.090
because I was in shock.

07:18.190 --> 07:20.814
- But you knew
what you had done?
- No!

07:20.914 --> 07:23.658
I didn't remember,
so why wouldn't I believe them?

07:23.758 --> 07:28.425
When did you...
Work out that you were...?

07:28.525 --> 07:32.471
I was flying back to Chicago
and I was on a layover in Rome.

07:32.571 --> 07:34.574
Three was a full moon,
and, um...

07:36.577 --> 07:38.480
I ate an Italian family

07:38.580 --> 07:40.582
in the car park
of the Holiday Inn.

07:41.784 --> 07:43.788
Oh.

07:45.110 --> 07:47.113
Hmm.

07:47.954 --> 07:50.457
Have you eaten anyone else?

07:50.558 --> 07:52.341
I haven't. I promise.

07:52.441 --> 07:54.144
That's why I moved here -

07:54.244 --> 07:56.307
to escape
everyone I care about.

07:56.407 --> 07:57.609
And every full moon,
I go behind that locked door

07:57.689 --> 07:59.191
and I just eat chickens.

07:59.291 --> 08:01.835
- You eat chickens?
- Yes.

08:01.935 --> 08:06.122
And only ones that are old or
have diseases or disabilities.

08:06.222 --> 08:08.525
Why don't you
go to the supermarket
and buy the chickens?

08:08.625 --> 08:10.168
'Cause they're
pumped full of hormones.

08:10.268 --> 08:12.211
You can't get organic ones?

08:12.311 --> 08:14.855
Like that Italian family
you ate?

08:14.955 --> 08:18.019
No. They have to be alive.
Or what?

08:18.119 --> 08:21.024
It's different when I wake up.
I get sick. Really sick.

08:21.124 --> 08:22.266
I think it's
as much about the killing

08:22.366 --> 08:23.868
as it is about the eating.

08:23.968 --> 08:26.352
Mmm.

08:26.452 --> 08:30.638
What about that goat?
That was a one-off.

08:30.738 --> 08:32.881
It's hard to get a goat in
without the neighbours
noticing.

08:32.981 --> 08:35.165
No, I mean,
what was wrong with the goat?

08:35.265 --> 08:37.288
The goat didn't look disabled.

08:37.388 --> 08:40.252
It had caprine
arthritis-encephalitis.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.855
- I don't know what that is.
- It was going to be put down.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.958
I'll take your word for it.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.543
I've never shared
this with anyone before.

08:47.643 --> 08:50.347
I can see why.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.552
Give me my keys so
I can get back to my daughter.

08:53.652 --> 08:55.395
Are you going to tell anyone?

08:55.495 --> 08:56.957
I... I don't...

08:57.057 --> 08:58.680
You can't!

08:58.780 --> 09:00.523
Is that a threat?

09:00.623 --> 09:02.606
Do you think
this is easy for me?

09:02.706 --> 09:04.969
I feel so guilty
about everything,

09:05.069 --> 09:06.612
and I've been in constant fear

09:06.712 --> 09:08.414
that I'm going to get
found out.

09:08.514 --> 09:10.457
I didn't ask you
to show me any of this.

09:10.557 --> 09:11.940
I never intended
to show you this.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.744
- You kissed me!
- I did.

09:14.844 --> 09:16.346
And it was a goodbye kiss,
and then you followed me here!

09:16.446 --> 09:18.588
You took my keys!

09:18.689 --> 09:21.153
I didn't mean
to take your fucking keys!

09:21.253 --> 09:23.477
- This is getting us nowhere.
- No shit.

09:23.577 --> 09:25.580
Are you going to tell anyone?

09:27.823 --> 09:29.606
I can't even believe
I'm going to say this.

09:29.706 --> 09:31.128
But what if we were to
entertain the possibility

09:31.228 --> 09:32.370
that this happened
for a reason?

09:32.470 --> 09:34.894
What are you talking about?

09:34.994 --> 09:38.579
I don't want this to sound
strange... stranger.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.063
But there have been
a lot of really weird signs.

09:41.163 --> 09:43.165
Keep the keys.

09:45.249 --> 09:46.551
- Gary!
- Let me go!

09:46.651 --> 09:48.794
Hear me out! Just hear me out.

09:48.894 --> 09:51.038
- I've already heard you out.
- No, just listen.

09:51.138 --> 09:53.121
When we crashed, there was
a song playing on the radio,

09:53.221 --> 09:54.463
and I recognise the voice,
but I don't know the band,

09:54.543 --> 09:56.326
I can't recognise the sound.

09:56.426 --> 09:58.569
And then the chorus kicked in
and I know it!

09:58.669 --> 10:01.253
Queens of the Stone Age -
David's favourite band!

10:01.353 --> 10:03.376
Why are you telling me
any of this?

10:03.476 --> 10:05.780
Fuck!

10:08.524 --> 10:10.587
Queens of the Stone Age
was David's favourite band.

10:10.687 --> 10:12.950
I don't care who your dead
husband's favourite band was!

10:13.050 --> 10:14.993
They're the band
we heard together in Prague.

10:15.093 --> 10:16.916
Right before I ate him.

10:17.016 --> 10:18.198
Don't you see?
I never listened to them again.

10:18.298 --> 10:20.682
But that song,

10:20.782 --> 10:24.367
that song was as if it
was written for... Excuse me!

10:24.467 --> 10:26.931
This song was like
it had been written
for the child we never had.

10:27.031 --> 10:30.136
And then I ran through
a red light and here we are!

10:30.236 --> 10:31.698
You're right, "a song
made you crash into us" -

10:31.798 --> 10:32.860
that does sound fucking crazy.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.623
It's not just that.

10:34.723 --> 10:36.145
You can attach meaning
onto anything.

10:36.245 --> 10:38.949
- Yeah, false meaning.
- Exactly.

10:39.049 --> 10:40.832
But what if this
isn't false meaning?
What if this is fate?

10:40.932 --> 10:42.314
It's a fucking coincidence,
Mary!

10:42.414 --> 10:44.458
It has nothing to do with me!

10:44.558 --> 10:47.061
When we crashed, it was the
anniversary of David's death.

10:48.543 --> 10:50.206
Mmm.

10:50.306 --> 10:52.169
Mmm.

10:52.269 --> 10:54.272
Why do you keep doing that?

10:55.914 --> 10:57.917
It was your anniversary too.

10:59.760 --> 11:03.385
Hey, quilt lady,
get off the road!

11:03.485 --> 11:06.670
How about I rip off your head
and shit down your neck?!

11:06.770 --> 11:08.153
You don't have to be
scared of me.

11:08.253 --> 11:10.196
I'm not going to hurt you,
or Emma.

11:10.296 --> 11:12.279
But, please, Gary,
you can't tell anyone.

11:12.379 --> 11:14.362
Why do you have a slit
in that door?

11:14.462 --> 11:15.964
What?

11:16.064 --> 11:17.567
That door.

11:17.667 --> 11:20.811
Your door inside of there.

11:20.911 --> 11:23.135
What is the purpose of
having a slit in that door?

11:23.235 --> 11:25.458
A viewing slit!

11:25.558 --> 11:28.783
Why have a viewing split
in that door,

11:28.883 --> 11:31.888
if you never expected to
share this stuff with anyone?

13:00.860 --> 13:02.863
..homicidal wolf...

13:19.288 --> 13:21.291
Oh, Dad's here.

13:25.617 --> 13:27.600
Gary! Shit!

13:27.700 --> 13:29.703
- Swear jar!
- Swear jar, babe.

13:40.399 --> 13:41.701
Everything OK?

13:41.801 --> 13:43.984
Haven't slept.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.909
Well, isn't that supposed to be
a good thing?

13:47.009 --> 13:49.833
- He hasn't been to bed.
- You dog!

13:49.933 --> 13:52.117
It's not what you think.

13:52.217 --> 13:53.398
Mate, you don't have to
explain yourself.

13:53.498 --> 13:55.642
No.

13:55.742 --> 13:57.865
I mean it's actually not
what you think.

14:05.556 --> 14:07.559
I'll go and get some towels.

14:11.205 --> 14:14.710
Daddy, tea party!

14:14.810 --> 14:16.813
Coming, sweetie.

14:39.207 --> 14:40.949
-Hey.
- Hey, Mary.

14:46.618 --> 14:49.602
Hi, Gwen! It's me, Mary.

14:49.702 --> 14:52.927
I came back to see you.
Look what I brought you.

14:53.027 --> 14:54.810
- Gerberas.
- Yeah.

14:54.910 --> 14:57.294
Oh, I love those.

14:57.394 --> 14:59.377
That's why I'm growing them
for you in my garden.

14:59.477 --> 15:01.981
Here, let's get rid of these guys.

15:02.081 --> 15:04.084
Nothing like
freshly-cut flowers.

15:06.888 --> 15:10.233
It's nice to see you, Gwen.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.336
It's always
really nice to see you.

15:14.579 --> 15:17.484
I almost wasn't
going to make it today.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.767
- But I wanted to
bring you something.
- Thank you.

15:19.867 --> 15:21.870
I made you another quilt.

15:24.394 --> 15:25.616
Cats. Lots of cats.

15:25.716 --> 15:28.059
Remember how you told me

15:28.159 --> 15:30.463
you and Theodore used to have
a lot of cats,

15:30.563 --> 15:33.988
and Theodore's favourite cat
was a black-striped tabby?

15:34.088 --> 15:36.091
You told me that
when we first met. Well...

15:37.173 --> 15:38.996
That's her.

15:39.096 --> 15:41.159
I'm sorry, I forgot her name.

15:41.259 --> 15:44.564
Look, she's got those stripes.

15:50.913 --> 15:53.657
I'm sorry, I won't be able to
finish this quilt, Gwen.

15:53.757 --> 15:55.620
Don't be sorry.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.144
I am. I... have to leave.

15:58.244 --> 15:59.707
I can't stay
in Adelaide anymore.

15:59.807 --> 16:02.471
Oh, no! Why?

16:02.571 --> 16:05.115
I met someone.

16:05.215 --> 16:10.122
It didn't work out,
but I didn't mean to meet him.

16:10.222 --> 16:14.008
He's a really sweet man,
and he has a lovely daughter.

16:14.108 --> 16:16.371
But she needs help.

16:16.471 --> 16:18.855
I feel...

16:18.955 --> 16:22.380
I don't know, I felt like...

16:22.480 --> 16:24.704
felt like the universe
was bringing us together,

16:24.804 --> 16:26.807
or something.

16:29.330 --> 16:31.774
But... then he...

16:34.698 --> 16:36.701
He saw who I am
and he got scared.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.869
Why did he get scared?

16:43.431 --> 16:45.334
Because I turn into a wolf.

16:45.434 --> 16:47.177
Hmph.

16:47.277 --> 16:50.102
We all do that.

16:50.202 --> 16:52.625
He saw me turn into one,
and eat a goat.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.243
We've all got
wolves in us, dear.

17:06.767 --> 17:08.770
You just have to make sure
you feed the right one.

17:11.133 --> 17:13.717
I know which wolf you feed,

17:13.817 --> 17:15.560
because you brought me
those flowers,

17:15.660 --> 17:17.663
and because you
brought me Matilda.

17:48.669 --> 17:50.532
Gary.

17:50.632 --> 17:52.535
You don't need to feel guilty

17:52.635 --> 17:54.638
for spending the night
with someone.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.703
We all want you to be happy.

17:57.802 --> 17:59.806
Uncle Gary happy?

18:00.647 --> 18:02.650
Thanks, Olivia.

18:07.417 --> 18:09.120
If he can't handle
sleeping with a chick,

18:09.220 --> 18:10.282
he's even more screwed up
than I thought.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.385
Yeah.

18:17.873 --> 18:20.577
- What should we do?
- Go home.

18:20.677 --> 18:22.059
Come on. It's Sunday.
The day's ours.

18:22.159 --> 18:24.383
We could do anything.

18:24.483 --> 18:27.187
How about we go to lunch?

18:27.287 --> 18:29.711
Your choice. Seriously.

18:29.811 --> 18:34.518
Pizza, burgers, ice-cream -

18:34.618 --> 18:36.621
whatever you want.

19:08.067 --> 19:09.930
Gary! What's wrong?

19:10.030 --> 19:11.413
- You're not hungry?
- No, no...

19:11.513 --> 19:12.775
Something wrong with the food?

19:12.875 --> 19:15.579
- You sure?
- Yeah.

19:15.679 --> 19:17.682
You alright, beautiful?
Everything good?

19:22.769 --> 19:24.772
Where were you last night?

19:26.094 --> 19:28.518
I went on a date.

19:28.618 --> 19:30.621
Did you go to her place?

19:31.623 --> 19:33.626
Yes.

19:37.992 --> 19:39.995
Will you see her again?

19:42.118 --> 19:44.742
Unfortunately,
she's not right for us.

19:44.842 --> 19:46.585
Us?

19:46.685 --> 19:48.788
Me.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.232
I don't think
she's right for me.

19:58.422 --> 20:00.425
- Did you put the radio on?
- No.

20:04.592 --> 20:09.139
I know this... Song.
I know this.

20:09.239 --> 20:11.742
When did you
start listening to music?

20:13.084 --> 20:14.146
Fuck!

20:14.246 --> 20:16.249
Dad, you idiot!

20:18.813 --> 20:22.298
♪ Where we all belong

20:25.943 --> 20:29.769
♪ And I'm so tired of seeing
