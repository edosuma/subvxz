WEBVTT

00:04.038 --> 00:05.106
>> ELLA: He messaged back.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.107
So we're meeting.

00:06.107 --> 00:07.241
Yeah, I have his number.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.043
My high school crush... I had

00:09.043 --> 00:10.344
called him and told him my

00:10.344 --> 00:11.479
feelings.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.313
Just thinking that he's gonna be

00:12.313 --> 00:13.347
out there is kind of weird.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.648
>> CHANDI: Ella might get lucky.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.917
(laughter)

00:16.917 --> 00:17.751
>> CAITLYN: You know we're going

00:17.751 --> 00:18.552
to Lamoni, where I went to

00:18.552 --> 00:19.553
college.

00:19.553 --> 00:20.954
It is a church-affiliated

00:20.954 --> 00:21.989
school.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.258
I'm quite nervous about this.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.159
>> PROTESTER: Caitlyn Jenner,

00:25.159 --> 00:26.427
you're an insult to all trans

00:26.427 --> 00:27.595
people.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.463
You don't represent us.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.264
>> CAITLYN: I am not

00:30.264 --> 00:31.299
representing you.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.366
I'm representing myself.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.301
>> MAN: Don't you (bleep) touch

00:33.301 --> 00:35.836
her!

00:35.836 --> 00:37.905
(indistinct chatter)

00:37.905 --> 00:38.772
>> CANDIS: Oh.

00:38.772 --> 00:39.907
Is that Hillary Clinton?

00:39.907 --> 00:42.076
Oh, my God.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.043
Caitlyn.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.012
>> CAITLYN: Hillary.

00:52.653 --> 00:53.687
>> CHANDI: Hi.

00:53.687 --> 00:54.555
>> CANDIS: Hi, how are you?

00:54.555 --> 00:55.256
>> MANICURIST: You, like, you

00:55.256 --> 00:56.023
want to pick a color and we'll

00:56.023 --> 00:56.890
get you seated down there?

00:56.890 --> 00:57.558
>> CHANDI: Okay.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.259
>> CANDIS: Okay.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.827
>> CAITLYN: Should we all go for

00:59.827 --> 01:02.763
the same color, for solidarity?

01:02.763 --> 01:03.831
>> CHANDI: Oh.

01:03.831 --> 01:04.698
That would be great.

01:04.698 --> 01:05.466
>> ELLA: I love that idea.

01:05.466 --> 01:06.567
A deep red?

01:06.567 --> 01:07.368
>> CAITLYN: See, she says a deep

01:07.368 --> 01:08.202
red.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.170
Do you ever go red?

01:09.170 --> 01:09.970
(Zackary laughs)

01:09.970 --> 01:10.804
>> ZACKARY: Never.

01:10.804 --> 01:11.539
Never, never.

01:11.539 --> 01:12.273
>> CAITLYN: Then it's time,

01:12.273 --> 01:12.973
baby.

01:12.973 --> 01:13.674
Get out of your comfort zone.

01:13.674 --> 01:14.475
>> ZACKARY: No, don't make me do

01:14.475 --> 01:15.509
it!

01:15.509 --> 01:16.344
>> JENNY: Oh, my gosh, look at

01:16.344 --> 01:17.645
these chairs.

01:17.645 --> 01:18.579
>> CAITLYN: Everybody, at the

01:18.579 --> 01:19.647
same time, turn on your

01:19.647 --> 01:20.581
vibrator.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.682
>> ZACKARY: Oh, oh, yes.

01:21.682 --> 01:22.550
>> CAITLYN: I know you will.

01:22.550 --> 01:23.584
>> ZACKARY: Oh, yes.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.952
>> ELLA: Are you doing the same?

01:24.952 --> 01:27.755
Doing the same color?

01:27.755 --> 01:29.056
Because I... I, as far as,

01:29.056 --> 01:30.158
like...

01:30.158 --> 01:31.259
>> ZACKARY: I feel paralyzed by

01:31.259 --> 01:32.293
the inability to make a

01:32.293 --> 01:33.327
decision.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.295
>> ELLA: I know. That's perfect.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.629
I feel the same way.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.497
>> ZACKARY: Paralyzed.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.431
>> CAITLYN: You know we're going

01:37.431 --> 01:38.366
to Lamoni...

01:38.366 --> 01:39.233
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.168
>> CAITLYN: ...uh, where I went

01:40.168 --> 01:41.001
to college.

01:41.001 --> 01:42.370
We're going to Iowa.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.471
First, Dubuque.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.738
We're gonna meet this wonderful

01:44.738 --> 01:47.175
lady, uh, Rachel, who's really

01:47.175 --> 01:48.709
organized her town on gender

01:48.709 --> 01:49.943
issues.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.413
Then we're off to Des Moines,

01:52.413 --> 01:53.914
where the Democratic debates

01:53.914 --> 01:54.815
are.

01:54.815 --> 01:55.983
Should be interesting.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.651
And then my old alma mater,

01:57.651 --> 01:59.052
Graceland University.

01:59.052 --> 02:01.422
Iowa, here we come.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.790
We're gonna do a presentation to

02:02.790 --> 02:03.957
the student body.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.693
Now, this is a church-affiliated

02:05.693 --> 02:06.994
school.

02:06.994 --> 02:09.029
It's basically a branch off of

02:09.029 --> 02:11.632
the Mormon religion.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.534
But here's the deal: I want to

02:13.534 --> 02:15.603
leave it open to the student

02:15.603 --> 02:19.473
body to ask questions.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.708
I mean, I've gotten a lot of

02:20.708 --> 02:24.678
letters since coming out and out

02:24.678 --> 02:26.614
of the religious side, uh, about

02:26.614 --> 02:28.682
50% are very positive.

02:28.682 --> 02:29.717
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

02:29.717 --> 02:30.551
>> CAITLYN: Uh, but on the other

02:30.551 --> 02:31.352
half, there's a lot of negative

02:31.352 --> 02:32.085
people.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.120
We've all seen it.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.222
So they can ask any question

02:34.222 --> 02:35.289
they want.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.089
>> CHANDI: You know we gonna be

02:36.089 --> 02:36.924
ready.

02:36.924 --> 02:37.825
>> ELLA: If we're speaking in

02:37.825 --> 02:39.293
front of the student body, I am

02:39.293 --> 02:42.296
actually gonna know somebody

02:42.296 --> 02:44.398
going there.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.233
>> CAITLYN: Oh...

02:45.233 --> 02:45.933
>> ELLA: From my high school,

02:45.933 --> 02:46.600
yeah.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.268
>> CAITLYN: No way.

02:47.268 --> 02:47.935
Went from your high school?

02:47.935 --> 02:49.002
>> ELLA: Yeah.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.239
My high school crush...

02:51.239 --> 02:53.241
I-I had called him, um, junior

02:53.241 --> 02:56.710
year, before my transition, and

02:56.710 --> 02:58.312
told him my feelings.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.112
>> INTERVIEWER: Have you seen

02:59.112 --> 03:00.881
him since you transitioned?

03:00.881 --> 03:02.716
>> ELLA: Um... yeah.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.152
I, um, I had been waiting for,

03:05.152 --> 03:08.256
like, all of high school to have

03:08.256 --> 03:09.290
a class with him.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.691
Then I have it, senior year,

03:10.691 --> 03:12.260
after I told him liked him and I

03:12.260 --> 03:14.094
come back as Ella, so it's this

03:14.094 --> 03:15.463
whole crazy thing.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.265
Uh, it definitely was, like, a

03:17.265 --> 03:20.100
weird... it was like, oh...

03:20.100 --> 03:21.034
'Cause I didn't know we were

03:21.034 --> 03:22.069
going to be speaking in front of

03:22.069 --> 03:23.271
the student body, and just

03:23.271 --> 03:24.137
thinking that he's going to be

03:24.137 --> 03:25.273
out there is kind of weird.

03:25.273 --> 03:26.274
>> JENNY: Are you okay?

03:26.274 --> 03:27.375
Or are you feeling...

03:27.375 --> 03:28.442
You sound a little worried.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.943
>> ELLA: I'm... I'm kind of

03:29.943 --> 03:32.980
nervous, you know?

03:32.980 --> 03:34.782
If I were to, let's say, run

03:34.782 --> 03:35.916
into him, it would be

03:35.916 --> 03:37.618
interesting to hear how...

03:37.618 --> 03:38.586
'Cause I never talked to him

03:38.586 --> 03:39.387
about it.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.120
>> CANDIS: How long ago was

03:40.120 --> 03:41.021
this?

03:41.021 --> 03:42.423
>> ELLA: Uh, last year.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.156
>> CANDIS: Last year.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.492
So it's pretty recent.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.294
>> ELLA: (bleep)'s best...

03:46.294 --> 03:47.661
sorry, that's his name.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.498
(bleep)'s best friend, um,

03:50.498 --> 03:51.732
Michael... they're both at

03:51.732 --> 03:52.633
Graceland.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.334
>> JENNY: They're both at

03:53.334 --> 03:54.001
Graceland?

03:54.001 --> 03:54.768
>> CAITLYN: Oh, they're both

03:54.768 --> 03:55.303
there.

03:55.303 --> 03:55.969
>> ELLA: Yeah, it's really

03:55.969 --> 03:56.637
strange.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.938
Michael, um... he was probably

03:57.938 --> 03:58.806
the only guy who wrote in my

03:58.806 --> 04:01.342
yearbook, and he wrote, "I hope

04:01.342 --> 04:03.210
our paths cross again."

04:03.210 --> 04:04.312
>> ZACKARY: Ooh.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.178
So this is the friend of the

04:05.178 --> 04:05.979
crush.

04:05.979 --> 04:06.714
>> ELLA: The friend.

04:06.714 --> 04:07.948
>> CAITLYN: No way.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.116
(laughter)

04:09.116 --> 04:09.917
>> ELLA: Strange.

04:09.917 --> 04:10.651
>> CAITLYN: We gotta stay

04:10.651 --> 04:11.519
overnight in Lamoni.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.219
>> CHANDI: Yes, we gotta stay

04:12.219 --> 04:12.720
overnight.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.487
>> CAITLYN: We can't just go

04:13.487 --> 04:14.154
through. I think we...

04:14.154 --> 04:14.855
>> CHANDI: No.

04:14.855 --> 04:15.523
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I think...

04:15.523 --> 04:16.189
>> CHANDI: Ella might get

04:16.189 --> 04:16.857
lucky.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.826
(laughter)

04:18.826 --> 04:20.794
*

04:33.474 --> 04:34.708
>> CAITLYN: Let's do it.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.244
(applause, music playing)

04:37.244 --> 04:40.180
>> MAN: Nice to meet you.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.349
>> CANDIS: Nice to meet you,

04:41.349 --> 04:41.982
Shannon.

04:41.982 --> 04:42.683
>> SHANNON: Nice to meet you,

04:42.683 --> 04:43.351
also.

04:43.351 --> 04:44.051
>> CAITLYN: Chicago House, they

04:44.051 --> 04:44.818
asked me to come in.

04:44.818 --> 04:45.486
They're having a big

04:45.486 --> 04:46.487
fund-raiser.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.855
It is really a great

04:47.855 --> 04:49.423
organization.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.058
They provide, uh, medical

04:51.058 --> 04:53.361
services, uh, employment

04:53.361 --> 04:56.096
opportunities and housing for

04:56.096 --> 04:57.164
our people who are living on the

04:57.164 --> 04:58.499
streets, who have, basically, no

04:58.499 --> 04:59.767
place to go.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.969
And that is a huge problem in

05:01.969 --> 05:04.538
this community.

05:04.538 --> 05:05.906
Thank you.

05:05.906 --> 05:09.743
(cheering)

05:09.743 --> 05:11.111
It is so my pleasure to be here

05:11.111 --> 05:12.913
for Chicago House.

05:12.913 --> 05:16.950
My experience is not even close

05:16.950 --> 05:18.852
to being the normal experience

05:18.852 --> 05:20.721
in this community.

05:20.721 --> 05:21.722
Yesterday, we got the

05:21.722 --> 05:23.256
opportunity to go visit a, kind

05:23.256 --> 05:24.492
of a subdivision of Chicago

05:24.492 --> 05:26.394
House and it's the TransLife

05:26.394 --> 05:29.763
Center, which really spotlights,

05:29.763 --> 05:31.499
um, homelessness in the trans

05:31.499 --> 05:32.400
community.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.133
>> CLIENT: When I got here, I

05:33.133 --> 05:34.267
was in a dark place.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.302
I was in a domestic

05:35.302 --> 05:36.537
relationship.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.639
I was 13, he was 21.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.741
And I dated him... he beat the

05:40.741 --> 05:41.875
crap out of me.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.444
I finally got away and I started

05:43.444 --> 05:45.846
doing drugs and drinking a lot.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.415
I mean, even trying to take care

05:47.415 --> 05:48.416
of myself...

05:48.416 --> 05:50.017
I started sex work.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.553
I did get raped before, and I

05:52.553 --> 05:54.888
just want girls younger than me

05:54.888 --> 05:55.956
to know that you don't have to

05:55.956 --> 05:58.158
do it.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.159
>> CAITLYN: You know what,

05:59.159 --> 06:00.761
everybody needs a break in life.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.762
Everybody needs a chance in

06:01.762 --> 06:02.763
life.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.064
And hopefully, by continuing on

06:04.064 --> 06:06.600
this conversation, we can make

06:06.600 --> 06:07.901
it better for the next

06:07.901 --> 06:09.637
generation coming up.

06:09.637 --> 06:10.771
Because there's lives at stake,

06:10.771 --> 06:12.039
here.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.707
There are so many great people

06:13.707 --> 06:15.809
in this community and it's a

06:15.809 --> 06:17.778
pleasure to be part of it.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.279
Thank you so much for having me

06:19.279 --> 06:20.814
and letting me tell my story.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.083
(cheering)

06:23.083 --> 06:26.086
>> WOMAN: Huzzah!

06:26.086 --> 06:28.055
>> CAITLYN: Thank you!

06:30.624 --> 06:32.059
(Zackary and Caitlyn whisper)

06:32.059 --> 06:33.326
>> CAITLYN: Did I do okay?

06:33.326 --> 06:34.027
>> ZACKARY: You did great.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.028
>> KATE: Nailed it, nailed it.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.997
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.167
>> PROTESTER: Caitlyn Jenner,

06:40.167 --> 06:41.502
you're an insult to all trans

06:41.502 --> 06:42.670
people.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.472
You don't represent us.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.773
You're a disgrace to our

06:45.773 --> 06:46.774
community.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.509
You have no right to speak for

06:48.509 --> 06:49.643
us.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.912
You get those awards and you

06:51.912 --> 06:54.181
dress up, but you have no idea

06:54.181 --> 06:55.683
what it's really like.

06:55.683 --> 06:56.850
Caitlyn Jenner, get away from

06:56.850 --> 06:59.487
us!

06:59.487 --> 07:00.754
We don't get jobs, we don't get

07:00.754 --> 07:02.022
any money, but you get all these

07:02.022 --> 07:03.223
awards.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.825
It isn't all fun and games.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.359
You don't care about the real

07:06.359 --> 07:07.895
trans women of America.

07:07.895 --> 07:08.896
>> CAITLYN: Wait a second, let's

07:08.896 --> 07:09.997
go see those girls.

07:09.997 --> 07:10.898
You only care about what you

07:10.898 --> 07:11.965
look like on TV.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.300
We don't need you, we don't want

07:13.300 --> 07:14.568
you.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.903
We don't want you here.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.605
You don't speak for us.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.906
We didn't ask for your help.

07:18.906 --> 07:22.209
(indistinct shouting)

07:22.209 --> 07:24.111
>> CHANDI: What are you doing,

07:24.111 --> 07:25.345
though, girl, what are you

07:25.345 --> 07:26.046
doing?

07:26.046 --> 07:26.847
>> CAITLYN: I'm not representing

07:26.847 --> 07:27.548
you.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.281
I'm representing myself.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.082
>> PROTESTER: Do not touch me!

07:29.082 --> 07:30.851
>> MAN: Do not touch her!

07:30.851 --> 07:33.987
Don't you (bleep) touch her!

07:33.987 --> 07:34.822
>> KATE: We're going to the

07:34.822 --> 07:36.256
Democratic debate tonight.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.725
It's time to address the

07:37.725 --> 07:39.527
elephant in the room.

07:39.527 --> 07:40.528
>> CAITLYN: Why is everybody

07:40.528 --> 07:43.130
looking at me?

07:43.130 --> 07:44.431
>> ELLA: He messaged back.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.533
So we're meeting.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.634
Yeah, I have his number.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.035
I don't know what people would

07:48.035 --> 07:49.837
think, seeing one of the

07:49.837 --> 07:51.238
football players sitting at

07:51.238 --> 07:54.141
lunch with Ella.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.910
>> PROTESTER: We don't want you.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.211
We don't want you here.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.713
You don't speak for us.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.048
We didn't ask for your help.

08:01.048 --> 08:04.918
(shouting indistinctly)

08:04.918 --> 08:06.554
>> CHANDI: What are you doing,

08:06.554 --> 08:07.555
though, girl, what are you

08:07.555 --> 08:08.221
doing?

08:08.221 --> 08:09.022
>> CAITLYN: I'm not representing

08:09.022 --> 08:09.690
you.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.591
I'm representing myself.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.291
>> PROTESTER: Do not touch me!

08:11.291 --> 08:12.159
>> MAN: Do not touch her!

08:12.159 --> 08:14.562
Don't you (bleep) touch her!

08:14.562 --> 08:16.296
Don't you (bleep) touch her!

08:16.296 --> 08:17.598
>> CHANDI: Leave!

08:17.598 --> 08:18.265
>> MAN: What the (bleep) is

08:18.265 --> 08:18.932
this?

08:18.932 --> 08:19.800
>> CHANDI: Leave!

08:19.800 --> 08:21.569
>> PROTESTER: I respect your

08:21.569 --> 08:24.204
transitioning but it's different

08:24.204 --> 08:25.472
than what I've experienced.

08:25.472 --> 08:26.206
>> CAITLYN: I totally agree, and

08:26.206 --> 08:27.007
I'm not trying to represent you,

08:27.007 --> 08:27.675
too.

08:27.675 --> 08:28.408
>> PROTESTER: I want a job, too.

08:28.408 --> 08:29.076
>> CAITLYN: I would love for

08:29.076 --> 08:29.743
you...

08:29.743 --> 08:30.578
>> PROTESTER: I can't get one

08:30.578 --> 08:32.245
because I'm trans and I'm black.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.246
>> CAITLYN: I would love for you

08:33.246 --> 08:34.481
to have a job and I'm trying to

08:34.481 --> 08:35.783
help people so they understand

08:35.783 --> 08:37.250
better.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.385
>> BODYGUARD: Police want us to

08:38.385 --> 08:39.119
get in the car.

08:39.119 --> 08:39.853
>> CAITLYN: Have a good day.

08:39.853 --> 08:40.588
(protesters shouting)

08:40.588 --> 08:41.655
>> WOMAN: Everybody in the van.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.723
This way.

08:42.723 --> 08:43.423
>> WOMAN 2: Ignore them.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.592
They're full of (bleep).

08:44.592 --> 08:46.594
>> CHANDI: Baby, you can't even

08:46.594 --> 08:47.795
show your face, so how are you

08:47.795 --> 08:49.396
gonna speak about what's an

08:49.396 --> 08:50.998
insult to our community and you

08:50.998 --> 08:52.165
can't even represent yourself

08:52.165 --> 08:54.868
and show who you are?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.203
What are you doing to further

08:56.203 --> 08:57.204
our community?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.606
If you're out here, willing to

08:58.606 --> 09:00.608
invest your energy and your time

09:00.608 --> 09:02.275
into trying to tear someone

09:02.275 --> 09:03.611
down, you could be using that

09:03.611 --> 09:06.279
same energy to lift someone up,

09:06.279 --> 09:08.281
and you're not doing anything,

09:08.281 --> 09:10.283
so what-what is the issue?

09:10.283 --> 09:12.285
>> KATE: All trans people are

09:12.285 --> 09:14.287
convinced they have the  truth

09:14.287 --> 09:16.624
about trans, and nobody else is

09:16.624 --> 09:17.625
trans but them.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.626
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Right. Yeah.

09:18.626 --> 09:19.627
>> KATE: Uh, you know?

09:19.627 --> 09:20.961
>> JENNY: You're doing it wrong.

09:20.961 --> 09:21.962
>> CAITLYN: I... I was trying

09:21.962 --> 09:22.963
to calm her down.

09:22.963 --> 09:23.964
"Calm down, calm down, calm

09:23.964 --> 09:25.298
down," you know?

09:25.298 --> 09:26.634
>> JENNY: It was the first time

09:26.634 --> 09:30.303
for Caitlyn that she saw, in the

09:30.303 --> 09:31.639
flesh, people's reservations

09:31.639 --> 09:32.640
about her.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.974
Um, and I think that's actually

09:33.974 --> 09:34.975
good for her.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.309
There are a lot of people with

09:36.309 --> 09:40.313
very, um, reasonable objections

09:40.313 --> 09:42.983
to her privilege, um, maybe her

09:42.983 --> 09:45.653
sense of womanhood or politics.

09:45.653 --> 09:46.987
You know, Caitlyn is a public

09:46.987 --> 09:48.321
figure for transgender people,

09:48.321 --> 09:49.657
but she's a problematic figure,

09:49.657 --> 09:52.292
and she needs to pay attention.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.033
>> CAITLYN: Time to get out of

10:00.033 --> 10:01.034
here.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.035
Going back to good old Iowa.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.704
(Ella sighs)

10:03.704 --> 10:05.372
>> ELLA: The bus.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.373
>> CHANDI: Hey!

10:06.373 --> 10:08.041
>> MIMI: So this is it.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.043
>> CANDIS: So Mimi is from Iowa,

10:10.043 --> 10:12.045
and I thought it would be really

10:12.045 --> 10:13.046
cool if she came along.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.047
I don't get to see her very

10:14.047 --> 10:15.048
often.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.717
So any time spent with my

10:16.717 --> 10:19.052
sister, I'm all for.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.721
>> ZACKARY: Hi, everyone.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.055
I had this dream.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.725
I was on this trip with, like,

10:24.725 --> 10:26.727
two serial killers.

10:26.727 --> 10:27.728
(Zackary laughs)

10:27.728 --> 10:29.396
>> KATE: Stop it.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.397
>> ZACKARY: I had, like, this

10:30.397 --> 10:32.065
crazy nightmare.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.734
>> CAITLYN: I know, I hate that.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.736
Next on the stop, we're going to

10:35.736 --> 10:37.070
Dubuque, Iowa.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.405
I live in Los Angeles.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.073
Tons of resources.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.408
People to help, programs to

10:41.408 --> 10:42.743
help.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.411
But what happens if you're in

10:44.411 --> 10:47.080
Dubuque, Iowa, and you're trans?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.415
What programs are available to

10:48.415 --> 10:49.416
you?

10:49.416 --> 10:52.419
*

10:52.419 --> 10:54.421
Oh, my God, look at this town.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.422
>> ELLA: Is this Dubuque?

10:55.422 --> 10:57.758
>> KATE: Main Street, USA.

10:57.758 --> 10:58.759
>> CAITLYN: Smell it?

10:58.759 --> 10:59.960
>> MIMI: I've been through

10:59.960 --> 11:01.161
this... these roads right here

11:01.161 --> 11:02.162
many times.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.164
>> ZACKARY: Oh, it's so cute.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.833
Gorgeous.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.501
>> CAITLYN: Ah, the sweet smell

11:08.501 --> 11:09.837
of Iowa.

11:09.837 --> 11:10.838
(laughing)

11:10.838 --> 11:11.839
>> CHANDI: We made it to

11:11.839 --> 11:12.840
Dubuque.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.174
>> ZACKARY: I-I love it already.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.175
>> CAITLYN: I know.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.844
>> ELLA: Let's go shop.

11:16.844 --> 11:17.845
>> COURTNEY: "Lingerie and

11:17.845 --> 11:18.846
jammies."

11:18.846 --> 11:19.780
>> ELLA (laughing): Lingerie.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.347
>> COURTNEY: Lingerie.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.348
Let's go there.

11:21.348 --> 11:21.849
>> ELLA: This way?

11:21.849 --> 11:23.516
>> COURTNEY: Yeah. First stop.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.517
>> JENNY: Wait, why are we

11:24.517 --> 11:25.518
buying lingerie?

11:25.518 --> 11:26.519
>> ELLA: Why not?

11:26.519 --> 11:27.187
>> KATE: Why not?

11:27.187 --> 11:29.189
Silly question.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.858
>> CANDIS: Jenny, do you have

11:30.858 --> 11:31.859
any lingerie?

11:31.859 --> 11:32.860
Like, for... for Deedie?

11:32.860 --> 11:33.861
>> JENNY: Um, I have... I have

11:33.861 --> 11:34.862
lots of flannel.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.196
(Mimi laughs)

11:36.196 --> 11:37.530
I have logs of gingham.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.531
>> CANDIS: Wait, I think the

11:38.531 --> 11:39.532
pink and black would be good for

11:39.532 --> 11:40.033
you. Yeah.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.034
>> JENNY: You think... you think

11:41.034 --> 11:42.035
it would... kind of, open up a

11:42.035 --> 11:42.535
new door for me?

11:42.535 --> 11:43.536
>> CANDIS: Yeah, I think we need

11:43.536 --> 11:44.037
to... Yeah.

11:44.037 --> 11:44.905
>> JENNY: Uh, it looks

11:44.905 --> 11:45.538
tremendously comfortable.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.539
>> CANDIS: Look-it, look at how

11:46.539 --> 11:47.540
gorgeous, these thigh-high

11:47.540 --> 11:48.541
stockings.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.542
>> JENNY: Oh yeah, 'cause, you

11:49.542 --> 11:50.543
know, I could wear these when

11:50.543 --> 11:52.545
I'm shoveling snow.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.883
You know, for me... lingerie

11:55.883 --> 11:57.217
is... is not simple.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.886
(chuckles)

11:58.886 --> 12:00.553
It's a fairly complicated thing.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.621
>> CANDIS: But have you ever

12:01.621 --> 12:02.956
worn a garter?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.624
>> JENNY: I'm trying to think.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.293
I think... I think one time when

12:06.293 --> 12:07.961
I was bear huntin'.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.296
(Candis laughs)

12:09.296 --> 12:10.630
>> CANDIS:Goddamn you.

12:10.630 --> 12:11.631
>> JENNY: But I kind of like

12:11.631 --> 12:12.632
this.

12:12.632 --> 12:13.967
(Candis laughs)

12:13.967 --> 12:14.968
>> CANDIS: And I'm sure Deedie

12:14.968 --> 12:16.636
will too.

12:16.636 --> 12:17.637
>> CAITLYN: I think there are

12:17.637 --> 12:18.638
some wild things going on in

12:18.638 --> 12:19.306
Dubuque.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.974
>> ELLA: I think so too.

12:20.974 --> 12:21.975
>> COURTNEY: Well, let's...

12:21.975 --> 12:23.944
let's participate.

12:26.646 --> 12:30.317
>> JENNY: Is it me?

12:30.317 --> 12:32.285
It could be.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.322
>> ZACKARY: Jenny Boylan's got a

12:35.322 --> 12:35.989
secret.

12:35.989 --> 12:36.990
>> JENNY: Oh, I don't know

12:36.990 --> 12:37.657
what you're t...

12:37.657 --> 12:38.658
>> ZACKARY: She's got a naughty

12:38.658 --> 12:39.326
secret.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.660
>> JENNY: I got some candles.

12:40.660 --> 12:44.331
I got some candles and some, uh,

12:44.331 --> 12:46.299
playing cards.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.141
>> CAITLYN: I think what all the

12:54.141 --> 12:55.843
girls should sample-- their

12:55.843 --> 12:56.844
first time with mountain

12:56.844 --> 12:57.845
oysters.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.146
>> CANDIS: Oh, what is that?

12:59.146 --> 13:00.147
Something weird.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.548
Like, balls or something.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.549
(laughing)

13:02.549 --> 13:03.884
Isn't it balls?

13:03.884 --> 13:04.885
>> CAITLYN: Bulls' testicles.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.220
>> CANDIS: Yes.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.221
>> CHANDI: Let's not and say we

13:08.221 --> 13:08.889
did.

13:08.889 --> 13:09.890
>> ZACKARY: Yeah.

13:09.890 --> 13:10.557
>> CHANDI: Yeah.

13:10.557 --> 13:11.558
>> KIP: I like the way you

13:11.558 --> 13:12.225
think, Chandi.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.560
>> CHANDI: Right.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.229
>> CAITLYN: Come on in!

13:16.229 --> 13:17.898
Hello, babe.

13:17.898 --> 13:18.899
>> RACHAEL: Hi. How are you?

13:18.899 --> 13:19.900
>> CAITLYN: Have a seat right

13:19.900 --> 13:20.400
here.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.401
These are all the girls.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.402
>> RACHAEL: Hello, gang.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.236
Nice to meet you.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.237
>> CAITLYN: Now, you probably

13:24.237 --> 13:25.238
have never had this many girls

13:25.238 --> 13:26.907
like us in this town...

13:26.907 --> 13:27.908
>> RACHAEL: Yeah, no.

13:27.908 --> 13:28.909
This-this is a first, for sure.

13:28.909 --> 13:29.910
>> CAITLYN: Isn't that good?

13:29.910 --> 13:30.577
Yay!

13:30.577 --> 13:31.578
>> RACHAEL: Great.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.245
>> CAITLYN: I like firsts.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.246
>> RACHAEL: Nice to see you all.

13:33.246 --> 13:33.914
Yeah.

13:33.914 --> 13:34.915
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I like firsts.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.249
>> JENNY: So what are we... what

13:36.249 --> 13:37.584
are gonna do tonight?

13:37.584 --> 13:38.585
>> RACHAEL: Well, I was a dealer

13:38.585 --> 13:39.920
at the casino-- I still am-- and

13:39.920 --> 13:40.921
we're gonna have some blackjack

13:40.921 --> 13:41.922
tables.

13:41.922 --> 13:42.923
You're gonna get to deal to the

13:42.923 --> 13:43.924
people in Dubuque.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.592
>> CANDIS: How rad is that?

13:45.592 --> 13:47.594
That's like a Bond movie.

13:47.594 --> 13:48.595
(laughs)

13:48.595 --> 13:49.596
>> RACHAEL: One of my doctors

13:49.596 --> 13:50.597
mentioned to me when I was going

13:50.597 --> 13:51.598
through transition here in

13:51.598 --> 13:53.533
Dubuque, uh, why didn't I move

13:53.533 --> 13:55.535
to somewhere larger that I might

13:55.535 --> 13:56.536
be more accepted there?

13:56.536 --> 13:59.206
I was pretty much the only one

13:59.206 --> 14:01.274
in this area when I came out.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.276
Um, and I said, "Because people

14:03.276 --> 14:04.277
need to be aware that there's

14:04.277 --> 14:05.946
transgender people everywhere."

14:05.946 --> 14:06.947
*

14:06.947 --> 14:08.615
So I knew that's why I had to

14:08.615 --> 14:10.283
stay here in Dubuque.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.284
>> CAITLYN: You are just a gutsy

14:11.284 --> 14:12.619
little thing, aren't you?

14:12.619 --> 14:14.287
I love that.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.956
Yeah.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.925
*

14:23.964 --> 14:25.632
>> KATE: Usually what changes a

14:25.632 --> 14:27.968
person's mind about trans in

14:27.968 --> 14:30.971
general is the moment they meet

14:30.971 --> 14:32.639
a trans person.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.308
So Caitlyn and all of us ladies

14:35.308 --> 14:38.645
in tow coming to Dubuque, now

14:38.645 --> 14:41.648
they got to meet... any number

14:41.648 --> 14:45.318
of us and see that... we're

14:45.318 --> 14:48.321
sweet.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.656
>> CAITLYN: Put your money on

14:49.656 --> 14:50.991
the table.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.993
Let's go.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.327
Are you ready?

14:54.327 --> 14:55.996
I'm taking your money.

14:55.996 --> 14:56.997
>> RACHAEL: Okay, let's deal you

14:56.997 --> 14:58.999
up and you up.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.333
And then we flip one over.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.401
>> KATE: Just want you to know

15:01.401 --> 15:02.402
I've been counting cards.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.404
(laughing)

15:04.404 --> 15:05.405
>> CHANDI: I'll be broke in a

15:05.405 --> 15:06.739
minute.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.075
>> RACHEL: I'm Rachel.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.076
By the way, welcome to Dubuque.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.077
>> CAITLYN: Nice to meet you,

15:10.077 --> 15:11.078
Rachel; come on in the middle.

15:11.078 --> 15:14.081
You get in the middle.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.082
(camera shutter clicks)

15:15.082 --> 15:16.083
You got it.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.084
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.085
>> RACHEL: Hey, thank you.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.086
>> LIZZIE: I'm, like, gender

15:19.086 --> 15:20.420
fluid, and I'm kind of having

15:20.420 --> 15:22.422
trouble, like, coming out.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.423
>> CAITLYN: With-with what?

15:23.423 --> 15:24.424
With coming out?

15:24.424 --> 15:25.425
>> LIZZIE: Yeah, and I just...

15:25.425 --> 15:26.426
>> CAITLYN: How old are you?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.427
>> LIZZIE: I'm 13.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.428
>> CAITLYN: You're how long?

15:28.428 --> 15:29.429
>> LIZZIE: 13.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.099
*

15:32.099 --> 15:33.100
>> CAITLYN: Surround yourself

15:33.100 --> 15:34.767
with positive people.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.103
Uplifting people.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.437
People who want to see you do

15:37.437 --> 15:38.438
well.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.772
Anybody give you any trash in

15:39.772 --> 15:40.773
your life, get them the hell out

15:40.773 --> 15:42.109
of your life.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.111
There's a lot of great, loving

15:44.111 --> 15:46.113
people out there.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.115
Pick your friends wisely.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.449
Be yourself.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.783
>> LIZZIE: That was really

15:50.783 --> 15:52.119
amazing meeting Caitlyn.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.453
She's such an inspiration to

15:53.453 --> 15:55.455
everyone in the LGBT community.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.457
I just wanted to thank her so

15:57.457 --> 15:59.459
much for being herself.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.460
>> CAITLYN: Look at all these

16:00.460 --> 16:01.528
people in this room.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.529
You know, there's so many good

16:02.529 --> 16:03.530
people out there.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.532
Find the right ones.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.533
Life will be good.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.201
>> LIZZIE: I'm so glad I got to

16:08.201 --> 16:10.537
meet her, and it was just one of

16:10.537 --> 16:12.539
the best days of my life.

16:12.539 --> 16:13.540
>> CAITLYN: You got it.

16:13.540 --> 16:14.541
Good luck to you.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.542
>> LIZZIE: Thanks.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.510
>> CAITLYN: Okay?

16:24.751 --> 16:25.752
Let's move it.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.087
>> CANDIS: Let's move it out.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.088
>> JENNY: Good-bye, Dubuque.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.090
>> CANDIS: Good-bye, Dubuque.

16:30.090 --> 16:33.426
>> JENNY: Howdy, Des Moines.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.095
>> KATE: May... may I kindly

16:35.095 --> 16:38.098
have your attention, please.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.100
We're approaching Des Moines.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.769
Um, it's time to address the

16:42.769 --> 16:44.437
elephant in the room.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.438
We're going to the Democratic...

16:45.438 --> 16:46.439
>> CAITLYN: There's an elephant

16:46.439 --> 16:47.440
in the room?

16:47.440 --> 16:48.441
>> KATE: There is an elephant in

16:48.441 --> 16:49.776
the room, Miss Caitlyn, there

16:49.776 --> 16:50.777
is.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.112
We're going to the Democratic

16:52.112 --> 16:55.115
debate tonight, and... there

16:55.115 --> 16:56.449
we're gonna be sitting in a room

16:56.449 --> 16:59.119
with young Republicans... and

16:59.119 --> 17:00.787
young Democrats.

17:00.787 --> 17:04.191
I would like to see if we can

17:04.191 --> 17:06.193
come to some agreed-upon

17:06.193 --> 17:08.861
guidelines so that the firestorm

17:08.861 --> 17:10.197
last time in Santa Fe...

17:10.197 --> 17:11.864
>> CAITLYN: Hey! Okay...

17:11.864 --> 17:12.865
>> KATE: ...doesn't happen

17:12.865 --> 17:14.534
again.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.203
I would like to suggest a

17:16.203 --> 17:18.538
safeword.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.873
Like, if I blow up or go,

17:20.873 --> 17:22.542
"Gah! I hate Trump!"

17:22.542 --> 17:23.543
You're not allowed to say it

17:23.543 --> 17:24.544
like that.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.880
Safeword: "God bless America."

17:27.880 --> 17:29.216
>> CANDIS: God bless America.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.883
>> JENNY: God bless America.

17:30.883 --> 17:31.884
In other words...

17:31.884 --> 17:36.723
>> ALL: * God bless America

17:36.723 --> 17:41.528
Our home sweet home... *

17:45.232 --> 17:47.900
(clapping, whooping)

17:47.900 --> 17:48.901
>> CAITLYN: Great!

17:48.901 --> 17:50.237
>> KATE: So anyone of... in this

17:50.237 --> 17:52.572
group says, "God bless America,"

17:52.572 --> 17:53.906
we immediately go, "Holy

17:53.906 --> 17:55.575
(bleep), am I being off the

17:55.575 --> 17:56.576
wall?"

17:56.576 --> 17:57.944
And we back... back down.

17:57.944 --> 17:58.945
>> CAITLYN: Why is everybody

17:58.945 --> 18:01.448
looking at me?

18:01.448 --> 18:02.982
>> CANDIS: In a room full of

18:02.982 --> 18:04.684
people we don't know, we don't

18:04.684 --> 18:07.754
want to insult anybody there.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.622
We don't want to get into fights

18:09.622 --> 18:11.224
with the Republicans.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.425
We don't want to get into fights

18:12.425 --> 18:13.826
with the Democrats, Caitlyn.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.728
>> JENNY: Let's also take into

18:15.728 --> 18:17.397
account that college students...

18:17.397 --> 18:18.298
>> CAITLYN: We're, we have to

18:18.298 --> 18:19.166
show ourselves as higher human

18:19.166 --> 18:20.200
beings.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.201
>> CANDIS: Exactly.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.469
>> CAITLYN: That's right.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.736
>> KATE: We've, we've been such

18:23.736 --> 18:25.505
a loving group, and I would like

18:25.505 --> 18:27.707
to see us continue that under

18:27.707 --> 18:30.643
what could be some stress.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.079
>> CANDIS: I'm a little nervous,

18:33.079 --> 18:35.882
uh, that-that Caitlyn will not

18:35.882 --> 18:37.750
be able to meet in the middle

18:37.750 --> 18:39.452
when it comes to her political

18:39.452 --> 18:42.355
beliefs, because I think people

18:42.355 --> 18:45.392
don't really want to hear about

18:45.392 --> 18:47.760
Caitlyn being a Republican.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.496
And so it makes me nervous that

18:49.496 --> 18:51.198
she's gonna go off on a rant

18:51.198 --> 18:53.733
and, um, I won't know how to

18:53.733 --> 18:55.302
protect her from that.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.869
>> CAITLYN: I'm practicing right

18:56.869 --> 18:58.638
now by keeping my mouth shut.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.241
(laughter)

19:01.241 --> 19:04.010
(indistinct chatter)

19:04.010 --> 19:05.111
>> CANDIS: Is that Hillary

19:05.111 --> 19:06.846
Clinton?

19:06.846 --> 19:09.081
Caitlyn.

19:09.081 --> 19:10.217
>> CAITLYN: He doesn't really

19:10.217 --> 19:12.319
appreciate this country.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.620
>> KATE: God bless America.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.422
God bless America.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.224
Now you're talking someone down.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.125
(sighs)

19:23.396 --> 19:25.498
>> CANDIS: Look at the pup, the

19:25.498 --> 19:26.933
bulldog.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.268
>> LUCILLE: Hi, I'm Lucille from

19:28.268 --> 19:29.135
Drake University.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.136
Welcome back.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.003
>> CAITLYN: It's nice

19:31.003 --> 19:31.704
to meet you, thank you.

19:31.704 --> 19:32.372
>> LUCILLE: It's nice

19:32.372 --> 19:33.240
to meet you as well.

19:33.240 --> 19:33.906
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.275
The Democratic debates are at

19:35.275 --> 19:36.543
Drake University in Des Moines,

19:36.543 --> 19:37.744
Iowa.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.612
In 1970, at that university, I

19:39.612 --> 19:42.949
ran my first decathlon.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.817
(oohs and ahs)

19:44.817 --> 19:47.654
>> CANDIS: 1978 inductee.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.356
>> COURTNEY: Holy wow...

19:49.356 --> 19:50.723
>> CAITLYN: This, this is where

19:50.723 --> 19:52.492
I ran my first ever decathlon.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.861
(oohs and ahs)

19:54.861 --> 19:56.028
>> CANDIS: This is where it all

19:56.028 --> 19:57.297
began.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.265
>> CAITLYN: This is the old

19:58.265 --> 19:59.866
place.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.268
Oh, my God, no!

20:01.268 --> 20:03.570
Oh, the old, the old Drake

20:03.570 --> 20:05.037
Relays.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.473
There we go, baby!

20:06.473 --> 20:08.207
You know, even though I'm

20:08.207 --> 20:09.509
transitioned and my life is so

20:09.509 --> 20:10.843
different today, I'm proud of

20:10.843 --> 20:12.745
that aspect of my life.

20:12.745 --> 20:13.746
>> COURTNEY: Should we all line

20:13.746 --> 20:14.747
up like we're racing?

20:14.747 --> 20:15.748
>> CAITLYN: No. (stammers)

20:15.748 --> 20:16.749
You'll be okay, don't worry.

20:16.749 --> 20:17.750
I don't want you to hurt

20:17.750 --> 20:18.751
yourself.

20:18.751 --> 20:19.752
>> JENNY: I'm not moving.

20:19.752 --> 20:20.620
I'm just getting down.

20:20.620 --> 20:21.621
>> CAITLYN: Okay, well, I'm

20:21.621 --> 20:22.289
hoping you can get back up

20:22.289 --> 20:23.290
again-- that's the problem.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.090
>> CHANDI: Right.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.091
>> CAITLYN: You know where

20:25.091 --> 20:25.758
the debates are?

20:25.758 --> 20:26.759
They're right here.

20:26.759 --> 20:27.760
So we got to get home,

20:27.760 --> 20:28.761
back and get changed?

20:28.761 --> 20:29.762
>> CHANDI: Yeah!

20:29.762 --> 20:30.763
>> CAITLYN: Let's get it going!

20:30.763 --> 20:31.798
>> CHANDI: Let's do it!

20:31.798 --> 20:33.766
(crickets trilling)

20:36.369 --> 20:38.438
(indistinct chatter)

20:38.438 --> 20:39.739
>> MAN: So, we'll give you a few

20:39.739 --> 20:40.573
instructions to get started.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.574
Over here on the tables, you can

20:41.574 --> 20:42.775
make your name tags.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.711
Um, we have blue if you identify

20:44.711 --> 20:46.846
as Democrat, red for Republicans

20:46.846 --> 20:48.848
and white for anything else.

20:48.848 --> 20:49.849
>> ZACKARY: This will be fun

20:49.849 --> 20:50.850
tonight.

20:50.850 --> 20:51.518
It will be interesting.

20:51.518 --> 20:52.519
>> CAITLYN: Yeah,

20:52.519 --> 20:53.486
it should be fun.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.487
>> ZACKARY: You know?

20:54.487 --> 20:55.488
>> CAITLYN: See all the free

20:55.488 --> 20:56.489
stuff Hillary's gonna give out.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.490
You know, it's gonna be good.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.358
>> ZACKARY: What do you mean

20:58.358 --> 20:59.258
"free stuff"?

20:59.258 --> 20:59.959
>> CAITLYN: Well, that's

20:59.959 --> 21:00.627
all she does.

21:00.627 --> 21:01.694
>> ZACKARY: Uh-huh.

21:01.694 --> 21:02.429
>> CAITLYN: Uh, she never says

21:02.429 --> 21:04.096
how we're gonna pay for it,

21:04.096 --> 21:04.831
but...

21:04.831 --> 21:06.132
>> ZACKARY: Yeah?

21:06.132 --> 21:07.834
Caitlyn's conservative politics

21:07.834 --> 21:09.669
are a concern for all of us.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.604
And I wonder how she'll be

21:11.604 --> 21:13.105
received.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.907
>> MAN: All right, everyone, uh,

21:14.907 --> 21:16.576
it's just a couple of minutes

21:16.576 --> 21:18.545
until the debate starts, so if

21:18.545 --> 21:19.679
you want to find your seats.

21:19.679 --> 21:20.713
Remember if you want to sit on

21:20.713 --> 21:21.914
the Democratic side, it's over

21:21.914 --> 21:23.683
here, the Independent side is in

21:23.683 --> 21:25.051
the middle and the Republicans

21:25.051 --> 21:26.419
over there.

21:26.419 --> 21:27.387
>> CAITLYN: Hi!

21:27.387 --> 21:28.455
>> CHANDI: Hi, Cait!

21:28.455 --> 21:29.622
>> CANDIS: Hi!

21:29.622 --> 21:30.790
>> CHANDI: Hi!

21:30.790 --> 21:31.824
>> KATE: I'm a Republican

21:31.824 --> 21:33.059
tonight.

21:33.059 --> 21:35.762
>> CHANDI: Okay, go Auntie Kate!

21:35.762 --> 21:37.697
>> MAN: Please welcome to Drake

21:37.697 --> 21:39.366
University, former Secretary of

21:39.366 --> 21:41.100
State Hillary Clinton.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.770
(applause)

21:43.770 --> 21:45.672
(Caitlyn boos)

21:45.672 --> 21:47.374
Senator Bernie Sanders of

21:47.374 --> 21:49.008
Vermont.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.877
(cheering)

21:50.877 --> 21:51.944
>> CAITLYN: Just like Obama, he

21:51.944 --> 21:53.179
doesn't really appreciate this

21:53.179 --> 21:56.282
country.

21:56.282 --> 21:57.617
>> KATE: God bless America.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.386
God bless America.

21:59.386 --> 22:00.820
Now you're talking someone down.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.122
I haven't said that all...

22:03.122 --> 22:04.156
>> CAITLYN: I'm talking his

22:04.156 --> 22:05.191
policy, but I'm saying his

22:05.191 --> 22:06.759
policies.

22:06.759 --> 22:07.994
>> KATE: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.195
>> CAITLYN: But think about it--

22:09.195 --> 22:10.597
>> KATE: God bless America.

22:10.597 --> 22:13.500
Please don't get angry at Obama

22:13.500 --> 22:15.001
or any particular person and I

22:15.001 --> 22:16.703
won't, either.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.471
(sighs)

22:18.471 --> 22:19.739
>> ELLA: Who put Kate and Cait

22:19.739 --> 22:21.408
next to each other?

22:21.408 --> 22:24.143
(laughter)

22:24.143 --> 22:25.478
>> MAN: Senator Sanders,

22:25.478 --> 22:26.646
in a previous debate, you said

22:26.646 --> 22:28.114
the greatest threat to national

22:28.114 --> 22:29.716
security was climate change.

22:29.716 --> 22:30.817
Do you still believe that?

22:30.817 --> 22:31.651
>> KATE: What do you think about

22:31.651 --> 22:32.419
that?

22:32.419 --> 22:33.119
>> CAITLYN: No, I don't

22:33.119 --> 22:34.153
understand that.

22:34.153 --> 22:34.987
>> KATE: I don't think so,

22:34.987 --> 22:36.055
either.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.089
>> CAITLYN: He's an idiot.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.658
>> KATE: No, no, no, no, no, no.

22:38.658 --> 22:39.926
>> CAITLYN: Sorry, sorry.

22:39.926 --> 22:40.793
>> KATE: What he just said was

22:40.793 --> 22:41.794
stupid, I agree.

22:41.794 --> 22:42.929
>> CAITLYN: He's misinformed.

22:42.929 --> 22:43.930
>> KATE: I agree.

22:43.930 --> 22:44.931
You pull back a little

22:44.931 --> 22:45.632
and I agree that...

22:45.632 --> 22:46.466
>> CAITLYN: Okay, okay.

22:46.466 --> 22:47.133
>> KATE: ...with what you

22:47.133 --> 22:47.834
just said.

22:47.834 --> 22:48.501
>> CAITLYN: I like this.

22:48.501 --> 22:49.235
Okay, great.

22:49.235 --> 22:50.169
>> KATE: Yeah, really.

22:50.169 --> 22:51.270
>> CAITLYN: Okay, I'll get it.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.605
>> KATE: Okay.

22:52.605 --> 22:53.440
>> CAITLYN: This has been a

22:53.440 --> 22:54.541
very, very good conversation.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.341
>> KATE: It is.

22:55.341 --> 22:56.342
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

22:56.342 --> 22:57.477
>> KATE: I'm-I'm going yay.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.679
I-I give her a B-plus for really

22:59.679 --> 23:01.914
trying to listen and-and

23:01.914 --> 23:03.516
communicate.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.317
I think we really are coming to

23:05.317 --> 23:06.453
a point where we can talk with

23:06.453 --> 23:07.754
each other.

23:07.754 --> 23:08.855
I mean, you saw what happened in

23:08.855 --> 23:09.889
Santa Fe-- we could not talk

23:09.889 --> 23:11.323
with each other.

23:11.323 --> 23:12.959
I had to leave the room.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.627
I have not had to leave the room

23:14.627 --> 23:15.795
and I've only had to sing "God

23:15.795 --> 23:18.064
Bless America" three times.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.866
(applause)

23:19.866 --> 23:22.635
>> MAN: I want to ask some of

23:22.635 --> 23:24.270
guests that are with us today

23:24.270 --> 23:25.538
what do you think's been good so

23:25.538 --> 23:26.338
far and what would you maybe

23:26.338 --> 23:27.607
critique?

23:27.607 --> 23:28.541
>> CANDIS: I think people are

23:28.541 --> 23:29.576
being a little tough on Hillary,

23:29.576 --> 23:30.743
personally.

23:30.743 --> 23:31.944
>> JENNY: I'd be happy to have

23:31.944 --> 23:32.912
any of these people as

23:32.912 --> 23:33.946
president.

23:33.946 --> 23:34.781
>> MAN: Okay, Caitlyn, do you,

23:34.781 --> 23:35.748
you got a red one, so from the

23:35.748 --> 23:37.216
Republican side...

23:37.216 --> 23:40.052
(laughter)

23:40.052 --> 23:41.320
>> CAITLYN: Coming out trans was

23:41.320 --> 23:43.890
like nothing, until I said I was

23:43.890 --> 23:45.792
a Republican.

23:45.792 --> 23:46.926
Um, it's kind of an interesting

23:46.926 --> 23:48.227
situation for me.

23:48.227 --> 23:49.529
They keep talking about the top

23:49.529 --> 23:50.930
1%, the top one--

23:50.930 --> 23:52.499
Oh, these terrible people, okay?

23:52.499 --> 23:54.033
I'm in the top 1%.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.635
I don't even have Obamacare and

23:55.635 --> 23:57.670
I had to put $450,000 in there.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.171
The healthcare's going to be

23:59.171 --> 24:01.007
worse, so I think we need a

24:01.007 --> 24:02.174
better tax structure.

24:02.174 --> 24:03.175
(Chandi singing "God Bless

24:03.175 --> 24:04.210
America")

24:04.210 --> 24:05.244
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I know, all my

24:05.244 --> 24:07.213
girls down here.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.115
I got all my girls down here!

24:09.115 --> 24:11.183
How we settle all our problems

24:11.183 --> 24:13.620
at the end-- are you ready?

24:13.620 --> 24:17.289
>> ALL: * God bless America.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.158
>> CAITLYN: That's it, okay.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.392
But that's how we settle it,

24:20.392 --> 24:21.894
because we all love our country.

24:21.894 --> 24:22.929
>> MAN: Thank you.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.864
(crowd cheering)

(all singing "God Bless

24:26.365 --> 24:28.100
America")

24:28.100 --> 24:28.901
>> CAITLYN: But I'm being very

24:28.901 --> 24:29.902
good!

24:29.902 --> 24:30.903
>> KATE: You are, you are,

24:30.903 --> 24:31.738
you are, you are.

24:31.738 --> 24:32.739
>> CAITLYN: Aren't I doing good?

24:32.739 --> 24:33.740
>> KATE: You're

24:33.740 --> 24:34.406
doing much better.

24:34.406 --> 24:35.074
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.043
>> CANDIS: You're doing great.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.985
(indistinct chatter)

24:55.662 --> 24:57.063

24:57.063 --> 24:58.397
Clinton?

24:58.397 --> 24:59.932
Oh, my God!

24:59.932 --> 25:01.601
Caitlyn.

25:01.601 --> 25:04.403

25:04.403 --> 25:05.738
It is a church-affiliated

25:05.738 --> 25:06.973
school.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.875
So, Chandi, if we say something

25:08.875 --> 25:10.242
and they come after you...

25:10.242 --> 25:11.644
>> CHANDI: I can't just sit

25:11.644 --> 25:16.115
there and-and-and take that.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.316
>> ZACKARY: You should sit next

25:17.316 --> 25:18.317
to 'em.

25:18.317 --> 25:19.318
>> ELLA: Ask good questions,

25:19.318 --> 25:20.319
'cause I don't think I'll be

25:20.319 --> 25:21.387
able to talk.

25:21.387 --> 25:22.388
>> ZACKARY: Okay.

25:22.388 --> 25:23.590
>> ELLA: It's just, like, that

25:23.590 --> 25:26.325
nervous, like, why him?

25:26.325 --> 25:28.294
Hi.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.599

Oh, my God!

Caitlyn.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.183
Good to see you.

25:51.183 --> 25:52.184
What are you doing here?

25:52.184 --> 25:52.952
Did you come for the debate?

25:52.952 --> 25:54.120
>> CANDIS: Yes.

25:54.120 --> 25:54.821
>> CAITLYN: Of course we did.

25:54.821 --> 25:55.955
>> HILLARY: How funny is that?

25:55.955 --> 25:57.156
>> CAITLYN: We are on the road.

25:57.156 --> 25:58.024
These are all my girls.

25:58.024 --> 25:58.925
There's Candis...

25:58.925 --> 25:59.859
>> HILLARY: Hi, guys.

25:59.859 --> 26:00.893
How are you all?

26:00.893 --> 26:01.894
>> CANDIS: Great job tonight.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.229

26:04.363 --> 26:05.131
on.

26:05.131 --> 26:05.932

26:05.932 --> 26:07.066
road dealing with trans issues

26:07.066 --> 26:08.167
across America.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.168
>> HILLARY: Oh, that's great.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.169
I have to tell you what's

26:10.169 --> 26:11.170
happening around the world

26:11.170 --> 26:12.171
deserves your attention.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.172
>> CAITLYN: (stammers) Yes.

26:13.172 --> 26:13.840
>> HILLARY: So anything

26:13.840 --> 26:14.506
you can do to help.

26:14.506 --> 26:15.507
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, we're trying

26:15.507 --> 26:16.242
to figure out a way

26:16.242 --> 26:16.909
we can do that.

26:16.909 --> 26:17.677
>> HILLARY: Good.

26:17.677 --> 26:18.711
>> CAITLYN: So we're, uh, we're

26:18.711 --> 26:19.779
moving along, you know?

26:19.779 --> 26:20.780
And these are the most fun girls

26:20.780 --> 26:21.781
to be with.

26:21.781 --> 26:22.782
>> HILLARY: Well, I just want

26:22.782 --> 26:23.850
you guys to have a great time

26:23.850 --> 26:25.051
and do great work.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.653
>> ZACKARY: Likewise.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.020
With Hillary Clinton, we were

26:28.020 --> 26:29.421
all so star struck, and Caitlyn

26:29.421 --> 26:30.790
was, too.

26:30.790 --> 26:31.791
You know, even though she kind

26:31.791 --> 26:33.860
of wanted to deny it, it was so

26:33.860 --> 26:35.762
palpable to me that I was like,

26:35.762 --> 26:37.697
"Oh, she's loving this.

26:37.697 --> 26:38.965
She's meeting a presidential

26:38.965 --> 26:40.232
front-runner."

26:40.232 --> 26:41.300
>> HILLARY: Got it?

26:41.300 --> 26:42.669
>> CAITLYN: Yep, we got it.

26:42.669 --> 26:43.335
>> HILLARY: Excellent.

26:43.335 --> 26:44.003
>> CAITLYN: All right.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.171
>> HILLARY: Thank you all.

26:45.171 --> 26:46.538
Great to see you.

26:46.538 --> 26:47.707
Say hello to your family, too.

26:47.707 --> 26:48.708
>> CAITLYN: I will.

26:48.708 --> 26:49.909
>> CANDIS: Yeah!

26:49.909 --> 26:50.710
>> ZACKARY: That was so awesome.

26:50.710 --> 26:51.577
(Caitlyn laughs)

26:51.577 --> 26:52.679
>> CAITLYN: I have to admit, I

26:52.679 --> 26:53.780
think she is very good on

26:53.780 --> 26:55.414
transgender civil rights.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.282
>> CANDIS: Yes.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.684
>> MIMI: Not me.

26:57.684 --> 26:58.785
I am so proud of you. Yeah.

26:58.785 --> 26:59.686
>> CAITLYN: You know, Hillary

26:59.686 --> 27:01.253
Clinton, she's very sweet.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.288
Very nice.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.289
And who, like, two minutes later

27:03.289 --> 27:05.524
comes by but... Bill.

27:05.524 --> 27:06.993
These are all my girls.

27:06.993 --> 27:08.761
We're doing a show right now on

27:08.761 --> 27:12.031
trans issues across America.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.933
He volunteered for a picture.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.702
Overall, I thought it was great.

27:15.702 --> 27:17.704
>> BILL CLINTON: Good luck!

27:17.704 --> 27:19.405
>> ZACKARY: Wow, that was pretty

27:19.405 --> 27:21.808
monumental.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.776
(camera shutters clicking)

27:41.928 --> 27:42.762
>> CHANDI: I'm gonna have a

27:42.762 --> 27:43.763
Strawberry Bitch.

27:43.763 --> 27:44.964
(laughter)

27:44.964 --> 27:46.733
Come on. Boom.

27:46.733 --> 27:47.433
>> WAITRESS: I mean, if

27:47.433 --> 27:48.200
anything, it's fun to order.

27:48.200 --> 27:48.868
We also have a Jackass.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.102
(laughter)

27:50.102 --> 27:50.803
>> KATE: Every bar has one of

27:50.803 --> 27:52.238
those.

27:52.238 --> 27:55.041
>> ELLA: So I just got the guts

27:55.041 --> 27:57.176
to message Michael.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.745
And I said, "Hey, Michael, long

27:58.745 --> 28:00.980
time no talk, uh, but I'm

28:00.980 --> 28:01.848
actually going to be in

28:01.848 --> 28:03.449
Graceland tomorrow with Caitlyn

28:03.449 --> 28:04.817
and, um, I was wondering if

28:04.817 --> 28:05.818
you'd want to meet."

28:05.818 --> 28:06.618
And, like, he, like... he

28:06.618 --> 28:07.987
messaged back.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.088
He gave me his number and he

28:09.088 --> 28:11.157
said, "Yeah, it would be totally

28:11.157 --> 28:11.858
awesome."

28:11.858 --> 28:12.825
He's like, "(bleep) is sleeping,

28:12.825 --> 28:13.760
but I'll ask him when he wakes

28:13.760 --> 28:14.493
up."

28:14.493 --> 28:15.427
>> CHANDI: Ooh.

28:15.427 --> 28:16.362
>> ELLA: So we're meeting.

28:16.362 --> 28:17.663
Yeah, I have his number.

28:17.663 --> 28:18.965
>> JENNY: Bravo.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.566
>> CHANDI: So, Cait, we're gonna

28:20.566 --> 28:21.801
be on your old stomping grounds

28:21.801 --> 28:23.069
tomorrow.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.203
Idea of what we're gonna be up

28:24.203 --> 28:26.072
against, or...?

28:26.072 --> 28:28.007
>> CAITLYN: Well, I heard

28:28.007 --> 28:29.175
they're also gonna open it up to

28:29.175 --> 28:31.177
questions from the student body.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.544
It is a church-affiliated

28:32.544 --> 28:33.645
school.

28:33.645 --> 28:35.614
So, Chandi, if we say something

28:35.614 --> 28:37.416
and they come after you, you

28:37.416 --> 28:38.417
gotta...

28:38.417 --> 28:39.986
>> CHANDI: I don't know, Cait.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.888
I can't say that I won't say it

28:41.888 --> 28:42.922
and mean it.

28:42.922 --> 28:43.790
>> CAITLYN: Don't scare me like

28:43.790 --> 28:44.390
this.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.157
>> CHANDI: I really can't say

28:45.157 --> 28:46.492
that, in-in-in order...

28:46.492 --> 28:49.461
I can't just sit there and-and

28:49.461 --> 28:50.462
take that.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.330
>> CAITLYN: You gotta realize

28:51.330 --> 28:52.531
that that's the college where I

28:52.531 --> 28:53.665
graduated and those-those people

28:53.665 --> 28:54.967
were very good.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.368
To be honest with you, going

28:56.368 --> 28:58.004
back to Graceland, I'm... I'm

28:58.004 --> 28:59.405
quite nervous about this.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.539
I can see where the girls are

29:00.539 --> 29:01.540
coming from.

29:01.540 --> 29:02.674
You know, if somebody would come

29:02.674 --> 29:03.709
after 'em, they're gonna... you

29:03.709 --> 29:04.811
know, they're fighters, all of

29:04.811 --> 29:05.945
these girls are fighters.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.679
But what they have to realize is

29:07.679 --> 29:09.816
also that I have a relationship,

29:09.816 --> 29:11.250
uh, with this school.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.820
I was very good and treated

29:13.820 --> 29:15.254
Hillary Clinton with a lot of

29:15.254 --> 29:17.689
respect and I-I want them to

29:17.689 --> 29:19.091
treat the student body and the

29:19.091 --> 29:20.126
teachers here with this same

29:20.126 --> 29:22.194
respect, uh, in the way they

29:22.194 --> 29:23.495
handle these issues.

29:23.495 --> 29:24.530
>> CHANDI: As long as they don't

29:24.530 --> 29:26.032
tell me that I'm a sinner for

29:26.032 --> 29:28.901
being who I am, I'll be okay.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.636
>> ZACKARY: But if they do...

29:30.636 --> 29:31.938
>> CHANDI: If they do, that's

29:31.938 --> 29:33.906
another problem.

29:36.909 --> 29:37.944
>> CAITLYN: Guys, hold it.

29:37.944 --> 29:38.845
This is big.

29:38.845 --> 29:40.079
The coaches while I was there...

29:40.079 --> 29:41.580
I was really wondering what

29:41.580 --> 29:45.184
their reaction is going to be.

29:45.184 --> 29:46.252
Are you ready?

29:46.252 --> 29:46.919
>> CANDIS: We're ready!

29:46.919 --> 29:47.653
>> CHANDI: Ready.

29:47.653 --> 29:48.420
(Zackary whoops)

29:48.420 --> 29:49.121
>> CAITLYN: Let's do it.

29:49.121 --> 29:49.856
>> ELLA: This conservative

29:49.856 --> 29:50.990
school...

29:50.990 --> 29:53.525
What are people gonna think?

29:54.894 --> 29:56.528
(birds singing)

29:56.528 --> 29:57.329
>> CANDIS: I see you're getting

29:57.329 --> 29:58.164
nervous.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.598
>> ELLA: I'm nervous for them,

29:59.598 --> 30:00.366
because they're gonna be so

30:00.366 --> 30:01.533
overwhelmed with all these

30:01.533 --> 30:03.635
beautiful trans women and, like,

30:03.635 --> 30:06.205
so much to, you know, take in.

30:06.205 --> 30:07.273
>> CHANDI: And how sweet are

30:07.273 --> 30:08.607
you, to be worrying about them

30:08.607 --> 30:10.109
when you should be worrying

30:10.109 --> 30:11.177
about you?

30:11.177 --> 30:12.278
>> ELLA: I wasn't necessarily

30:12.278 --> 30:13.445
the... the coolest person in

30:13.445 --> 30:14.113
high school.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.614
I don't know what people would

30:15.614 --> 30:17.449
think, seeing one of the

30:17.449 --> 30:18.885
football players sitting at

30:18.885 --> 30:20.819
lunch with Ella.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.554
Men in general, when it comes to

30:22.554 --> 30:23.755
putting yourself in that

30:23.755 --> 30:24.991
situation, where you're

30:24.991 --> 30:26.625
publically viewed either

30:26.625 --> 30:28.394
intimately with a trans woman or

30:28.394 --> 30:30.462
just friendly with a trans

30:30.462 --> 30:31.864
woman.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.765
This conservative school...

30:33.765 --> 30:36.035
What are people gonna think?

30:36.035 --> 30:36.802
>> CHANDI: Oh, you're coming

30:36.802 --> 30:37.703
with your posse, girl, you gotta

30:37.703 --> 30:38.404
get over it.

30:38.404 --> 30:39.071
>> ELLA: Yeah.

30:39.071 --> 30:39.805
>> ZACKARY: With your girl gang.

30:39.805 --> 30:40.606
>> CHANDI: You right.

30:40.606 --> 30:41.507
You coming with your posse and

30:41.507 --> 30:42.674
you're all good and that's the

30:42.674 --> 30:43.542
zone you need to focus and be

30:43.542 --> 30:44.843
in.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.844
>> ELLA: Out of anyone that I

30:45.844 --> 30:47.646
went to school with, it had to

30:47.646 --> 30:50.116
be him and his best friend at

30:50.116 --> 30:51.884
Graceland.

30:51.884 --> 30:52.919
>> COURTNEY: They're gonna be so

30:52.919 --> 30:53.619
excited.

30:53.619 --> 30:54.520
>> CHANDI: Like Zackary said,

30:54.520 --> 30:55.287
you should be looking at it as

30:55.287 --> 30:57.256
an opportunity to shine.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.361
>> CAITLYN: Everybody on their

31:02.361 --> 31:03.930
best behavior.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.197
>> ZACKARY: (bleep) A.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.198
>> CAITLYN: (bleep) A.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.633
I like that attitude, girls!

31:07.633 --> 31:08.935
Actually, I was doing pretty

31:08.935 --> 31:09.936
good on the whole ride down

31:09.936 --> 31:10.602
here.

31:10.602 --> 31:11.470
Now I'm actually kind of

31:11.470 --> 31:12.238
nervous.

31:12.238 --> 31:13.172
Yeah, I never wore heels at

31:13.172 --> 31:14.206
Graceland.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.944
(laughter)

31:17.944 --> 31:19.145
>> JOHN: I'm John Sellars.

31:19.145 --> 31:19.811
>> CAITLYN: Caitlyn.

31:19.811 --> 31:20.512
How are you doing?

31:20.512 --> 31:21.213
>> JOHN: Caitlyn, great to

31:21.213 --> 31:21.948
have you here.

31:21.948 --> 31:22.548
>> CAITLYN: My pleasure.

31:22.548 --> 31:23.349
>> JOHN: We've been looking

31:23.349 --> 31:23.849
forward to it.

31:23.849 --> 31:24.583
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, this is pretty

31:24.583 --> 31:25.251
cool.

31:25.251 --> 31:26.218
Guys, hold it. This is big.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.619
This is Jerry Hampton.

31:27.619 --> 31:28.687
>> JERRY: Oh, God, it's good to

31:28.687 --> 31:29.621
see you.

31:29.621 --> 31:30.389
>> CAITLYN: How you doing?

31:30.389 --> 31:31.123
>> JERRY: I'm doing good,

31:31.123 --> 31:31.958
really.

31:31.958 --> 31:32.724
>> CAITLYN: You're still here!

31:32.724 --> 31:33.559
(Jerry laughs)

31:33.559 --> 31:34.360
And Bill Dudek.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.094
How are you doing?

31:35.094 --> 31:36.662
>> BILL: Hey, good to see you.

31:36.662 --> 31:37.596
>> CAITLYN: Good to see you.

31:37.596 --> 31:39.031
When I was at Graceland, as far

31:39.031 --> 31:41.333
as my identity, I had my

31:41.333 --> 31:42.768
diversions in life and I found

31:42.768 --> 31:44.036
sports and I could be "the guy"

31:44.036 --> 31:45.972
in sports.

31:45.972 --> 31:47.706
And Jerry Hampton was one of the

31:47.706 --> 31:49.008
coaches while I was there, and

31:49.008 --> 31:50.076
Bill Dudek, one of the other

31:50.076 --> 31:50.876
coaches.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.511
I was really wondering what

31:52.511 --> 31:54.013
their reaction is going to be.

31:54.013 --> 31:54.880
>> JERRY: They were sure

31:54.880 --> 31:56.148
bragging on you in my office.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.216
>> CAITLYN: Oh, really?

31:57.216 --> 31:58.217
>> JERRY: They were talking

31:58.217 --> 31:59.218
about you as a student and how

31:59.218 --> 32:00.452
proud they are of you.

32:00.452 --> 32:01.387
I know they're gonna be telling

32:01.387 --> 32:02.321
you that.

32:02.321 --> 32:03.189
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, well, I

32:03.189 --> 32:04.090
appreciate that.

32:04.090 --> 32:05.057
>> ELLA: Should I sit on the

32:05.057 --> 32:05.992
other side, or sit here, next to

32:05.992 --> 32:07.093
them?

32:07.093 --> 32:08.027
>> ZACKARY: No, you should sit

32:08.027 --> 32:09.095
next to 'em.

32:09.095 --> 32:09.996
>> ELLA: Ask good questions,

32:09.996 --> 32:10.829
'cause I don't think I'll be

32:10.829 --> 32:11.630
able to talk.

32:11.630 --> 32:12.598
>> ZACKARY: Okay.

32:12.598 --> 32:13.532
>> ELLA: I'm... I don't even

32:13.532 --> 32:14.633
have feelings anymore, it's just

32:14.633 --> 32:16.635
like that nervous, like, "Why

32:16.635 --> 32:18.237
him?"

32:18.237 --> 32:19.205
You know?

32:19.205 --> 32:20.272
But I need to remember that high

32:20.272 --> 32:22.141
school's over, we're all adults

32:22.141 --> 32:24.643
here, and, um, I hope that we'll

32:24.643 --> 32:27.113
have a nice conversation.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.114
>> WOMAN: Thank you.

32:28.114 --> 32:29.648
>> ELLA: Hi.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.317
Michael.

32:31.317 --> 32:32.184
Hello, Michael, how are you?

32:32.184 --> 32:32.884
>> MICHAEL: Hey, Ella, how you

32:32.884 --> 32:33.552
doing?

32:33.552 --> 32:34.286
I'm doing good. How are you?

32:34.286 --> 32:35.021
>> ELLA: Good, I'm doing

32:35.021 --> 32:35.587
awesome. This is Jenny.

32:35.587 --> 32:36.288
>> MICHAEL: Hi, Jenny, nice to

32:36.288 --> 32:36.788
meet you.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.589
>> JENNY: Hi. What's your name?

32:37.589 --> 32:38.124
>> MICHAEL: Michael.

32:38.124 --> 32:38.624
Nice to meet you.

32:38.624 --> 32:39.325
>> JENNY: Michael, it's a

32:39.325 --> 32:39.891
pleasure to meet you.

32:39.891 --> 32:40.626
>> MICHAEL: Pleasure meetin'

32:40.626 --> 32:41.127
you.

32:41.127 --> 32:41.793
>> CANDIS: Now, did you have

32:41.793 --> 32:42.761
another friend that was coming?

32:42.761 --> 32:43.462
>> MICHAEL: We had a class

32:43.462 --> 32:45.431
together today and he didn't go.

32:48.467 --> 32:49.635
And when I went back to the

32:49.635 --> 32:50.902
room, after my class, he wasn't

32:50.902 --> 32:52.304
there.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.405
And I texted him, like, "Hey,

32:53.405 --> 32:54.440
where are you?"

32:54.440 --> 32:56.308
No reply and... I haven't gotten

32:56.308 --> 32:57.309
a reply.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.479
Yeah.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.048
>> WOMAN: How did you go about,

33:02.048 --> 33:03.349
like, keeping on to your

33:03.349 --> 33:04.550
transformation and still

33:04.550 --> 33:07.919
acknowledging God in your life?

33:07.919 --> 33:09.321
>> CHANDI: How?

33:09.321 --> 33:10.822
>> CAITLYN: Chandi.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.692
>> CHANDI: I got this one.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.128
>> CANDIS: Now, did you have

33:16.128 --> 33:17.129
another friend that was coming?

33:17.129 --> 33:18.164
>> MICHAEL: We had a class

33:18.164 --> 33:22.301
together today and he didn't go.

33:22.301 --> 33:23.735
And when I went back to the

33:23.735 --> 33:25.071
room, after my class, he wasn't

33:25.071 --> 33:26.605
there.

33:26.605 --> 33:27.973
And I texted him, like, "Hey,

33:27.973 --> 33:29.075
where are you?"

33:29.075 --> 33:31.077
No reply and... I haven't gotten

33:31.077 --> 33:32.144
a reply.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.479
Yeah.

33:33.479 --> 33:34.946
>> ELLA: The fact that (bleep)

33:34.946 --> 33:37.849
didn't come kind of showed me

33:37.849 --> 33:39.985
that... I mean, it didn't... I

33:39.985 --> 33:40.986
don't even know if it really

33:40.986 --> 33:41.987
showed me anything.

33:41.987 --> 33:43.189
He might have just been nervous,

33:43.189 --> 33:44.190
you know?

33:44.190 --> 33:46.225
Um... you can't blame him for

33:46.225 --> 33:47.326
that.

33:47.326 --> 33:49.495
Uh, I definitely do want to give

33:49.495 --> 33:53.165
full kudos to Michael though,

33:53.165 --> 33:55.101
for him to kind of come in

33:55.101 --> 33:56.368
there, knowing that he was going

33:56.368 --> 33:58.137
to be in front of a camera

33:58.137 --> 33:59.705
alone.

33:59.705 --> 34:00.772
>> KATE: What was it like for

34:00.772 --> 34:02.241
you when Ella went through her

34:02.241 --> 34:03.409
transition?

34:03.409 --> 34:04.810
>> MICHAEL: Um, I think my first

34:04.810 --> 34:06.978
time I saw her, uh, at the

34:06.978 --> 34:07.979
Ventura County Fair.

34:07.979 --> 34:08.980
>> ELLA: I came in my

34:08.980 --> 34:10.182
high-waisted shorts and a little

34:10.182 --> 34:11.183
crop top.

34:11.183 --> 34:12.184
No, terrible.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.185
>> MICHAEL: First thing I

34:13.185 --> 34:14.520
thought was, "Oh, maybe she

34:14.520 --> 34:15.587
transferred from a different

34:15.587 --> 34:16.855
school, like, out of state or

34:16.855 --> 34:17.856
something like that, and

34:17.856 --> 34:18.857
everybody just happens to know

34:18.857 --> 34:19.858
her but me."

34:19.858 --> 34:20.859
I was like, "Okay."

34:20.859 --> 34:21.860
Then when I made eye contact

34:21.860 --> 34:22.861
with her, I was like, "Wow."

34:22.861 --> 34:24.330
I was kind of, like, in awe,

34:24.330 --> 34:25.931
like, that she, like, came out

34:25.931 --> 34:26.932
like that.

34:26.932 --> 34:27.933
I thought that was very bold.

34:27.933 --> 34:28.934
>> KATE: Mike.

34:28.934 --> 34:29.601
>> MICHAEL: Yes.

34:29.601 --> 34:30.402
>> KATE: You're a gentleman.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.137
>> MICHAEL: Thank you.

34:31.137 --> 34:32.404
>> ELLA: Gentleman, yes.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.139
>> KATE: You are.

34:33.139 --> 34:33.939
>> CAITLYN: Ready to go do this,

34:33.939 --> 34:34.606
babe?

34:34.606 --> 34:37.008
>> CHANDI: Let's do it.

34:37.008 --> 34:38.144
>> CAITLYN: I hope that the

34:38.144 --> 34:39.778
girls respect that this is my

34:39.778 --> 34:41.147
school, this is where I went to

34:41.147 --> 34:43.048
college, this is where my name

34:43.048 --> 34:45.717
is on the whole sports complex.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.319
I just don't want to do anything

34:47.319 --> 34:49.255
to upset anybody.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.422
I want this to be informative

34:50.422 --> 34:52.291
for the students and the

34:52.291 --> 34:53.825
faculty to learn something about

34:53.825 --> 34:54.826
our community.

34:54.826 --> 34:55.827
Are you ready?

34:55.827 --> 34:56.828
>> ELLA: We're ready.

34:56.828 --> 34:57.829
>> KATE: We're ready.

34:57.829 --> 34:58.830
>> CAITLYN: Let's do it.

34:58.830 --> 34:59.831
>> KATE: All right.

34:59.831 --> 35:00.899
>> CANDIS: We got your back.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.934
(indistinct chatter)

35:07.206 --> 35:09.175
(applause)

35:22.254 --> 35:23.622
>> RAQUEL: Today Graceland

35:23.622 --> 35:25.191
students have a great

35:25.191 --> 35:26.592
opportunity to have a discussion

35:26.592 --> 35:28.194
about gender identity, so I'm

35:28.194 --> 35:29.795
very, very excited.

35:29.795 --> 35:33.565
There are no wrong questions.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.201
>> ELLA: I, I thought I was

35:35.201 --> 35:37.803
nervous before we got to

35:37.803 --> 35:39.838
Graceland College, but my

35:39.838 --> 35:42.974
stomach is just dropping.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.710
You know, after having the lunch

35:44.710 --> 35:46.778
with Michael and, um, the other

35:46.778 --> 35:49.215
boy not showing up, I don't know

35:49.215 --> 35:51.082
what to expect.

35:51.082 --> 35:52.784
>> RAQUEL: You ask what you feel

35:52.784 --> 35:54.420
you should ask.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.387
>> ELLA: It's very

35:55.387 --> 35:57.256
nerve-racking.

35:57.256 --> 35:58.757
>> STUDENT: My question is, how

35:58.757 --> 36:00.226
did you go about keeping onto

36:00.226 --> 36:01.427
your journey of, like, your

36:01.427 --> 36:03.229
transformation and still

36:03.229 --> 36:04.763
acknowledging God in your life?

36:04.763 --> 36:06.265
Because, like, religion and

36:06.265 --> 36:07.399
everything.

36:07.399 --> 36:10.236
(indistinct chatter)

36:10.236 --> 36:12.571
>> CHANDI: How?

36:12.571 --> 36:13.772
>> CAITLYN: Chandi?

36:13.772 --> 36:15.741
>> CHANDI: I got this one.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.578
>> CAITLYN: Chandi?

36:19.578 --> 36:20.612
>> CHANDI: I got this one.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.581
(indistinct chatter)

36:24.616 --> 36:26.618
Well, it actually was hard.

36:26.618 --> 36:27.719
I grew up in a very religious

36:27.719 --> 36:28.920
family.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.756
Many years I heard that my life

36:30.756 --> 36:33.592
was an abomination.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.261
So I lost touch with God for

36:35.261 --> 36:36.962
many years.

36:36.962 --> 36:39.465
I had to recognize the fact that

36:39.465 --> 36:42.601
God knew who I was before I did.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.370
So how can I be falling out of

36:44.370 --> 36:46.004
touch with God when he knew

36:46.004 --> 36:48.173
before I did.

36:48.173 --> 36:49.575
It's a connection that I've made

36:49.575 --> 36:51.477
that now that I have, I'll never

36:51.477 --> 36:53.279
let it go again.

36:53.279 --> 36:57.082
(applause)

36:57.082 --> 37:00.519
>> KATE: My daughter is a

37:00.519 --> 37:02.954
high-ranking executive in the

37:02.954 --> 37:05.457
Church of Scientology.

37:05.457 --> 37:08.026
And to Scientologists,

37:08.026 --> 37:12.364
my trans-ness is proof

37:12.364 --> 37:15.567
that I am an evil person

37:15.567 --> 37:18.136
and should not be talked with.

37:18.136 --> 37:19.771
So I haven't seen her since she

37:19.771 --> 37:21.307
was nine.

37:21.307 --> 37:23.642
She's now 42, 43 years old.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.315
I haven't completely given up

37:29.315 --> 37:30.982
hope.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.117
I haven't, and especially

37:32.117 --> 37:34.320
getting some strength from the

37:34.320 --> 37:36.121
women I'm traveling with now.

37:36.121 --> 37:39.024
And just being able to say this

37:39.024 --> 37:41.360
to you.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.429
Look for the heart of the

37:43.429 --> 37:46.164
doctrine you're following.

37:46.164 --> 37:49.134
And if it's at all mean, think

37:49.134 --> 37:51.437
twice before following it any

37:51.437 --> 37:53.171
further.

37:53.171 --> 37:54.373
Thank you.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.342
(applause)

37:59.545 --> 38:01.947
>> STUDENT: So, my question is

38:01.947 --> 38:03.415
what kind of pronouns should we

38:03.415 --> 38:05.351
be using when referring to you?

38:05.351 --> 38:06.151
>> CAITLYN: Uh, for me the

38:06.151 --> 38:07.353
pronoun thing changed

38:07.353 --> 38:08.954
immediately when Vanity Fair

38:08.954 --> 38:10.121
came out.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.223
Now I go by, uh, "she."

38:12.223 --> 38:14.360
>> KATE: I prefer the pronoun

38:14.360 --> 38:15.727
"they."

38:15.727 --> 38:17.062
I don't mind "she."

38:17.062 --> 38:18.096
>> CHANDI: I go by Beyoncé

38:18.096 --> 38:19.431
pronouns.

38:19.431 --> 38:21.833
(laughter, applause)

38:21.833 --> 38:24.035
Boom!

38:24.035 --> 38:26.004
Boom!

38:26.004 --> 38:28.006
>> STUDENT 2: Okay, so my

38:28.006 --> 38:30.241
question is how has living as a

38:30.241 --> 38:33.011
woman and facing the woes in

38:33.011 --> 38:34.613
life, living as a woman,

38:34.613 --> 38:36.281
affected you?

38:36.281 --> 38:37.449
>> CANDIS: I, I don't know.

38:37.449 --> 38:39.217
I feel ten times more powerful

38:39.217 --> 38:40.486
as a woman.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.087
I do.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.022
(applause)

38:44.022 --> 38:46.992
I always felt nothing made sense

38:46.992 --> 38:48.394
before, and as soon as I

38:48.394 --> 38:49.795
transitioned, I had a light

38:49.795 --> 38:51.296
inside me that nobody's gonna

38:51.296 --> 38:52.664
(bleep) with me.

38:52.664 --> 38:53.832
I'm sorry.

38:53.832 --> 38:57.202
(students cheering)

38:57.202 --> 38:58.837
>> CHANDI: I think that the-the

38:58.837 --> 39:00.906
power is-is great, but I think

39:00.906 --> 39:03.409
in relationships, it allows me

39:03.409 --> 39:04.876
to think like he's thinking.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.712
I still can recognize game.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.079
And I love that part.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.047
>> STUDENT: Yeah!

39:09.047 --> 39:10.649
(applause)

39:10.649 --> 39:13.652
Can I get a witness?

39:13.652 --> 39:15.454
>> ELLA: Um, I honestly think

39:15.454 --> 39:17.055
being a woman has nothing to do

39:17.055 --> 39:18.524
with the physicality of our

39:18.524 --> 39:20.225
beings.

39:20.225 --> 39:22.060
Um, I am the same exact person I

39:22.060 --> 39:25.296
was, uh, before my transition.

39:25.296 --> 39:27.699
your life is always evolving and

39:27.699 --> 39:29.234
not every day is going to be the

39:29.234 --> 39:31.036
best day.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.337
>> CHANDI: Right.

39:32.337 --> 39:33.639
>> ELLA: But you know, you can

39:33.639 --> 39:34.673
make it the best day as

39:34.673 --> 39:35.974
possible, so...

39:35.974 --> 39:37.943
(applause)

39:42.080 --> 39:44.550
>> CHANDI: I totally love Ella,

39:44.550 --> 39:47.586
and before we left on the trip,

39:47.586 --> 39:49.755
I told her, "Ella, we want you

39:49.755 --> 39:52.090
to be a sponge and we want you

39:52.090 --> 39:54.325
to absorb all this knowledge

39:54.325 --> 39:56.027
that is around you."

39:56.027 --> 39:57.596
And in that moment, she was just

39:57.596 --> 40:00.198
so poised and just being able to

40:00.198 --> 40:01.967
see her grow around us and see

40:01.967 --> 40:04.302
how we're all individually

40:04.302 --> 40:05.937
rubbing off on her

40:05.937 --> 40:07.906
makes that so beautiful.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.040
>> STUDENT: I just want to get

40:09.040 --> 40:10.576
your input on how happy you guys

40:10.576 --> 40:11.910
are right now?

40:11.910 --> 40:13.479
'Cause you guys look happy.

40:13.479 --> 40:14.713
>> CAITLYN: Honestly, for years

40:14.713 --> 40:15.881
and years, I struggled.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.516
I would literally go to my

40:17.516 --> 40:18.817
house, uh, never really coming

40:18.817 --> 40:19.985
out.

40:19.985 --> 40:21.687
That was really, really tough

40:21.687 --> 40:23.288
times for me.

40:23.288 --> 40:24.723
And I had lost that spirit for

40:24.723 --> 40:26.324
life, because I just didn't know

40:26.324 --> 40:28.293
who I was.

40:28.293 --> 40:31.563
I have to admit today...

40:31.563 --> 40:34.533
I can't wait...

40:38.136 --> 40:39.538
I can't wait for the day to get

40:39.538 --> 40:40.506
started.

40:40.506 --> 40:42.974
I'm excited about life.

40:42.974 --> 40:44.309
I got things to do.

40:44.309 --> 40:47.278
I love myself.

40:47.278 --> 40:50.115
That was a long struggle.

40:50.115 --> 40:53.084
(applause)

41:04.129 --> 41:06.164
>> JENNY: In Graceland College,

41:06.164 --> 41:07.165
I think in some ways the tables

41:07.165 --> 41:08.299
were turned.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.335
I think that it was Caitlyn's

41:10.335 --> 41:12.103
turn to be a little bit afraid

41:12.103 --> 41:13.539
of what we might say.

41:13.539 --> 41:15.674
But everybody on that stage was

41:15.674 --> 41:17.776
remarkably eloquent.

41:17.776 --> 41:19.210
We didn't know how we were gonna

41:19.210 --> 41:20.345
be received when we got there.

41:20.345 --> 41:22.213
And people were not just

41:22.213 --> 41:23.715
respectful, but interested and

41:23.715 --> 41:24.983
supportive, which I think caught

41:24.983 --> 41:27.118
us all by surprise.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.386
>> CAITLYN: What a privilege it

41:28.386 --> 41:29.555
has been to talk to all my

41:29.555 --> 41:30.589
little brothers and sisters of

41:30.589 --> 41:31.890
Graceland.

41:31.890 --> 41:33.124
Go out there, be your true self.

41:33.124 --> 41:35.326
And kick butt and work hard.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.829
(students cheering)

41:37.829 --> 41:38.964
>> CHANDI: Thanks for asking

41:38.964 --> 41:40.365
about our happiness.

41:40.365 --> 41:41.399
We never get questions about our

41:41.399 --> 41:42.400
happiness.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.401
>> STUDENT: I figured.

41:43.401 --> 41:44.402
>> CHANDI: It's always about the

41:44.402 --> 41:45.403
bad stuff, so thank you for

41:45.403 --> 41:46.572
that.

41:46.572 --> 41:47.573
>> CAITLYN: Did I do okay up

41:47.573 --> 41:48.574
there?

41:48.574 --> 41:49.575
>> JERRY: What a great,

41:49.575 --> 41:50.308
great thing.

41:50.308 --> 41:51.309
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

41:51.309 --> 41:52.110
>> JERRY: I couldn't be prouder

41:52.110 --> 41:52.911
with everything that

41:52.911 --> 41:53.612
you've done.

41:53.612 --> 41:54.580
>> CAITLYN: No, there's, there's

41:54.580 --> 41:55.446
mostly great...

41:55.446 --> 41:56.281
>> JERRY: You're doing such a

41:56.281 --> 41:57.148
great thing for everyone.

41:57.148 --> 41:57.949
>> CAITLYN: Those girls I got

41:57.949 --> 41:58.984
with me are just phenomenally

41:58.984 --> 41:59.918
good.

41:59.918 --> 42:01.186
I think probably the most

42:01.186 --> 42:03.889
important thing of of my story

42:03.889 --> 42:06.257
is that no matter what your

42:06.257 --> 42:08.927
situation is, that-that they can

42:08.927 --> 42:10.596
live their lives authentically.

42:10.596 --> 42:12.097
They can overcome the obstacles

42:12.097 --> 42:13.298
that they have in life.

42:13.298 --> 42:14.666
'Cause everybody has them.

42:14.666 --> 42:15.967
That's my mission.

42:15.967 --> 42:17.402
Team Caitlyn, you guys did good!

42:17.402 --> 42:18.604
You guys did so good!

42:18.604 --> 42:19.605
>> ZACKARY: You were really

42:19.605 --> 42:20.606
great.

42:20.606 --> 42:22.340
>> CAITLYN: I'm so proud of you!

42:22.340 --> 42:24.109
It's not just trans issues.

42:24.109 --> 42:25.777
It's about dealing with all of

42:25.777 --> 42:27.779
our stuff that we have.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.147
>> CANDIS: Thank you for

42:29.147 --> 42:31.182
bringing me there.

42:31.182 --> 42:32.751
I was a little nervous and I was

42:32.751 --> 42:33.819
a little hard on you and I-I'm

42:33.819 --> 42:34.820
sorry.

42:34.820 --> 42:35.821
>> CAITLYN: Oh, it's okay.

42:35.821 --> 42:36.822
It's okay.

42:36.822 --> 42:37.823
>> CANDIS: And I'm gonna be more

42:37.823 --> 42:39.124
open to...

42:39.124 --> 42:40.258
>> CAITLYN: Say it.

42:40.258 --> 42:41.893
(laughs)

42:41.893 --> 42:43.194
>> CANDIS: I'll be a little bit

42:43.194 --> 42:44.362
more open to your conservative

42:44.362 --> 42:45.631
views.

42:45.631 --> 42:48.634
>> CAITLYN: Ooh, I like that.

42:48.634 --> 42:50.669
I love that.

42:50.669 --> 42:52.170
We still got a long ways to go.

42:52.170 --> 42:53.238
>> CANDIS: We do.

42:53.238 --> 42:54.372
>> CAITLYN: We're only in

42:54.372 --> 42:55.173
Lamoni.

42:55.173 --> 42:56.274
>> CANDIS: I know!

42:56.274 --> 42:57.275
>> CAITLYN: We have plenty of

42:57.275 --> 42:59.244
time to discuss.

43:03.114 --> 43:04.382
>> TRAINER: Get up.

43:04.382 --> 43:05.516
Squat down.

43:05.516 --> 43:06.652
>> CANDIS: This trainer, he's

43:06.652 --> 43:07.853
really yummy.

43:07.853 --> 43:09.254
And he seems like he's flirting

43:09.254 --> 43:10.856
back.

43:10.856 --> 43:11.723
This is the longest I've been

43:11.723 --> 43:12.924
without a relationship.

43:12.924 --> 43:13.925
>> TRAINER: I think it might be

43:13.925 --> 43:15.126
just around the corner.

43:15.126 --> 43:16.127
>> CAITLYN: Disick is in the

43:16.127 --> 43:17.128
house.

43:17.128 --> 43:18.129
>> SCOTT: Hello!

43:18.129 --> 43:19.130
>> CAITLYN: Scott is kind of

43:19.130 --> 43:20.131
unpredictable.

43:20.131 --> 43:21.132
I-I hope we see the good side.

43:21.132 --> 43:22.133
>> SCOTT: I haven't talked

43:22.133 --> 43:23.134
to you all night.

43:23.134 --> 43:24.135
>> CAITLYN: I know.

43:24.135 --> 43:24.803
>> COURTNEY: Are you

43:24.803 --> 43:25.804
ignoring him?

43:25.804 --> 43:26.805
>> CAITLYN: No, I'm not ignoring

43:26.805 --> 43:27.806
him-- he's over there.

43:27.806 --> 43:28.807
>> SCOTT: I'm gonna put myself

43:28.807 --> 43:29.808
to bed.
