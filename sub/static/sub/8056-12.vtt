WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.001
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:02.068 --> 00:05.072
the next City Councilor
for the great city of Pawnee,

00:05.138 --> 00:06.242
Bobby Newport.

00:08.274 --> 00:09.947
Hey, Bobby.
Hey.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.387
Thanks, guy.

00:13.179 --> 00:15.159
Hey. All right. Hi.

00:15.248 --> 00:16.318
I'm Bobby Newport.

00:16.383 --> 00:18.260
You know, we're two days
into this campaign,

00:18.318 --> 00:20.059
and so far
it's going great.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.964
In fact, I don't know
why they call it a cam-pain.

00:23.023 --> 00:26.027
Because up until now, it's been
a cam-pleasure.

00:26.092 --> 00:27.400
All right. Hey,
why don't we line up

00:27.460 --> 00:29.599
for autographs and free Bobby Bars?

00:29.662 --> 00:31.539
Who wants a Bobby Bar?

00:31.965 --> 00:33.273
Bobby Newport.

00:33.333 --> 00:34.539
Heir to the
Sweetums Candy Fortune.

00:34.601 --> 00:35.636
My dad made them.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.045
He just
entered the race,

00:37.103 --> 00:40.107
and he's already 70 points
up in all of the polls.

00:40.173 --> 00:42.175
He is attractive
and charming.

00:42.242 --> 00:45.246
<i>And his family employs
half the town But so what?</i>

00:45.578 --> 00:47.558
I am a lifelong
government bureaucrat

00:47.614 --> 00:48.957
who is well-versed
in the issues.

00:49.049 --> 00:53.691
And those are the kind of sexy
qualifications that win elections.

00:53.753 --> 00:55.323
How's it going?
I'm Bobby Newport.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.560
But you probably
knew that already.

00:56.623 --> 00:59.467
Well, Mr. Newport, we meet at last.
I'm Leslie Knope.

00:59.526 --> 01:00.834
Ah! Okie-doke.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.465
So do you want me to sign it
to Mrs. Lope or just Nesnee?

01:03.530 --> 01:06.409
What? No.
I... Leslie's fine.

01:06.466 --> 01:07.501
Leslie.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.104
Yeah. Ms. Knope is a
candidate for City Council.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.172
We've been calling your office
trying to set up a debate.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.741
Oh, no, you guys are wrong.
I'm running unopposed.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.550
I'm pretty sure I'm
running unopposed. Right?

01:17.610 --> 01:19.487
No. You're not
running unopposed.

01:19.546 --> 01:21.253
You're very opposed, by me.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.694
Oh. Terrific.
I love meeting people.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.697
I love it. Yeah.
What do you guys do?

01:27.620 --> 01:29.827
We just told you. We're going
to be running for City Council.

01:29.889 --> 01:32.836
Great. Here, have a Bobby Bar.
Go ahead. My dad made them.

01:32.892 --> 01:34.200
Okay, folks.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.466
Hey. I'm Bobby Newport.

01:35.528 --> 01:36.563
I think we scared him.

01:36.629 --> 01:37.903
Here, have a Bobby Bar.
My dad made them.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074

01:58.418 --> 02:00.022
Hey, Ann.
Are you still a nurse?

02:00.086 --> 02:02.794
Or did they fire you, because
you slept with all the doctors?

02:02.856 --> 02:04.028
Do you want to
try that again?

02:05.358 --> 02:07.031
Hey, Ann.
Are you still a nurse?

02:07.093 --> 02:08.731
Because Andy's
not feeling well.

02:08.828 --> 02:09.966
What's wrong, Andy?

02:10.029 --> 02:12.339
Just got a headache.
And I'm seeing double.

02:12.398 --> 02:14.537
And I've got a song stuck in
my head and my teeth hurt.

02:14.834 --> 02:16.871
Also, I'm hungry.

02:16.936 --> 02:18.938
Okay. Well, some of those
things are symptoms

02:19.005 --> 02:21.281
and some of them are
just being a person.

02:21.441 --> 02:22.886
Did you hit your head?

02:22.942 --> 02:23.977
No.

02:24.844 --> 02:27.290
Oh, yes.
Technically, I did smash

02:27.347 --> 02:29.850
my head area
into the wall area.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.260
Yeah. He was hanging
up his gold record.

02:34.787 --> 02:36.323
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

02:36.422 --> 02:38.333
Yeah. I'm good.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.666
Point is,
I have a gold record.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.367
Well, I can help you
with cuts and bruises.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.501
But the other stuff, you're going
to have to see a real doctor.

02:46.566 --> 02:47.977
Hey, smartass,
we can't afford it.

02:48.034 --> 02:51.277
Hey, smartass, yes, you can.
You have insurance.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.941
Neither of
your asses are that smart.

02:53.006 --> 02:57.819
Because insurance is for if
something bad happens to your car.

02:57.877 --> 03:00.084
PS, I haven't
had it in years.

03:00.146 --> 03:01.784
Oh, my God.
We used to live together.

03:01.881 --> 03:03.019
Aw!

03:03.082 --> 03:04.755
You've still
got it for me.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.759
I'm Bobby Newport.

03:06.819 --> 03:10.426
My family owns nine square
miles of land in this town.

03:10.490 --> 03:13.494
And isn't my family what
this town is really about?

03:13.560 --> 03:14.698
Vote Bobby Newport.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.741
- That guy is everywhere.
- Yeah.

03:16.796 --> 03:18.070
I am not complaining.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.735
Well, we have to
find away to beat him.

03:19.799 --> 03:22.780
And, luckily, Ben is
going to announce

03:22.835 --> 03:25.338
the most amazing
campaign strategy

03:25.405 --> 03:28.249
ever thought of in the entire
history of Western democracy.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.378
Go, Ben!
Go, Ben!

03:29.442 --> 03:31.752
Here's your great idea. We're
all ready for it. And, start.

03:31.811 --> 03:34.382
I'm running for office.
I'm surrounded by my friends.

03:34.447 --> 03:36.927
My campaign manager
and I are in love.

03:36.983 --> 03:40.453
This is exactly how I dreamed
it would be when I was a kid.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.932
Except I wasn't
70 points behind,

03:42.989 --> 03:45.299
and my campaign manager
was Mr. Belvedere.

03:45.525 --> 03:49.371
We are David.
Newport is Goliath.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.865
This is our slingshot.

03:53.099 --> 03:55.238
Yes. We'll write
an inspiring op-ed piece.

03:55.301 --> 03:59.215
No. The Pawnee-Eagleton
High School basketball game.

03:59.272 --> 04:02.481
Now, in this town, it's bigger
than the Super Bowl.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.283
We take all our money, we air
a TV ad right at halftime.

04:05.612 --> 04:06.613
- Yes.
- Cool.

04:06.679 --> 04:10.593
I think we should make an attack
ad against Bobby Newport.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.220
Whoa!
That is a great idea.

04:12.285 --> 04:13.320
Thank you.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.024
- That's a good idea.
- All right, great.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.293
So let's get to work.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.860
Ron Swanson.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.701
How are you?
Present.

04:21.793 --> 04:23.569
I have a meeting
at Public Works,

04:23.630 --> 04:25.906
and I was thinking that maybe
you might want to sit in.

04:26.132 --> 04:27.406
Why would you think that?

04:27.467 --> 04:30.175
They are working on a number of
fascinating big-budget projects.

04:30.236 --> 04:31.408
I'm very busy here.

04:31.471 --> 04:34.714
That I am being forced
to brutally cut entirely.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.053
I can make room
in my schedule.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.248
Wonderful.

04:38.311 --> 04:40.848
As you know, I'm not a big
fan of delivering bad news.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.325
Chris, it would be
my absolute pleasure.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.187
Have you considered cutting
the entire fire department?

04:46.252 --> 04:50.997
I have personally put out several local
fires at no cost to the taxpayer.

04:51.324 --> 04:52.735
Look to the left.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.197
The right.

04:54.994 --> 04:56.098
Whatever.

04:56.162 --> 04:57.470
Are you the kind of
doctor who gets hooked

04:57.530 --> 04:59.203
on his own drugs?
I bet you are.

04:59.265 --> 05:00.744
So, Andy,
tell me what happened.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.041
I was reading
an encyclopedia.

05:03.102 --> 05:06.845
And I tripped or "fell
over" and hit my head.

05:07.073 --> 05:09.212
Or brain helmet.

05:09.275 --> 05:10.345
Whatever you call it.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.856
Yeah, he sneezed and smacked
his head against the wall.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.253
That sounds about right.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.818
Well, if it's a concussion,
it's extremely mild,

05:16.883 --> 05:18.294
so I wouldn't
worry about it.

05:18.384 --> 05:19.727
Anything else
bothering you?

05:20.086 --> 05:21.292
Nope.
Okay.

05:21.387 --> 05:25.563
Well, I mean, yeah. I've got a
weird rash in my knee-pit area.

05:25.692 --> 05:29.265
And my tongue on this side
doesn't taste anything anymore.

05:29.462 --> 05:31.339
Sometimes, when I walk,
my ankles make, like,

05:31.397 --> 05:33.206
a weird rattlesnake sound.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.268
What else?
Things that are far away

05:35.335 --> 05:36.871
from my eyes are fuzzy.

05:36.936 --> 05:39.712
I once ate a Twix
with the wrapper on it.

05:39.772 --> 05:41.479
And I've never seen
the wrapper come out.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.179
Also, I've swallowed
every piece of gum

05:43.242 --> 05:44.846
that I've chewed
for the past 25 years.

05:44.911 --> 05:46.447
Andy...
I don't know.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.925
And I broke my thumb on the way over here.
Just fix me.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.291
Well, I can help you
with the thumb,

05:52.352 --> 05:54.457
but I'll have to
give you referrals

05:54.520 --> 05:56.557
for specialists for
the other 1,000 things.

05:56.622 --> 05:59.102
Wow. Thanks
for nothing, Dr. Harris.

05:59.292 --> 06:00.293
You're welcome.

06:00.660 --> 06:03.300
Hey, I'm Bobby Newport.
I'm a regular guy.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.899
I like dogs.

06:04.997 --> 06:07.443
I'm here with my Persian
greyhound, Reclette,

06:07.500 --> 06:09.173
who was given
to me by my buddy,

06:09.235 --> 06:11.442
the pretender to the crown
of Alsace-Lorraine.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.676
Hey, between you and me,

06:14.741 --> 06:18.450
I think that Donna is having a problem
with going negative in the ad.

06:18.611 --> 06:20.613
Nuh-uh.
I always go negative.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.785
Even if I like the guy,
I go negative.

06:23.015 --> 06:24.221
Keeps them interested.

06:24.484 --> 06:25.485
Thanks, Donna.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.121
Well, I didn't want
to tell you this,

06:27.186 --> 06:29.223
but Ann is having
a hard time with this.

06:29.288 --> 06:30.596
She's kind of
freaking out right now.

06:30.656 --> 06:33.262
Oh, my God. This magic
marker smells like cherries.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.831
Hey, here's a question.

06:36.162 --> 06:37.732
Do you like the idea?

06:38.431 --> 06:41.901
It's... l...Who...
Do you like it?

06:42.168 --> 06:44.478
Look. You have a vision of
how your campaign should go.

06:44.537 --> 06:47.017
I am your chief strategist. So
I'm sure we can work it out.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.144
Why don't you just tell me
what you're thinking?

06:49.208 --> 06:51.916
I hate negative ads, and I would
never do one in a million years.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.384
Thank you, John
for coming in.

06:55.515 --> 06:57.756
The Public Works Department
is wonderful.

06:57.817 --> 07:01.492
And you are the best idea
man in the business.

07:01.554 --> 07:05.127
Also, we're canceling all
of your on-going projects.

07:05.191 --> 07:07.933
What? What about
the Pawnee River dam?

07:07.994 --> 07:10.099
Dam's dead.
Have a nice day.

07:10.396 --> 07:12.569
Where will
all the water go?

07:12.632 --> 07:14.202
Wherever it's headed now.

07:14.700 --> 07:15.804
The important thing is,

07:15.868 --> 07:19.611
the dam is never happening, and
your dream has been crushed.

07:20.706 --> 07:22.549
- We're very sorry.
- I am not.

07:22.608 --> 07:23.609
Good meeting.

07:25.244 --> 07:27.190
It's not a negative ad.

07:27.246 --> 07:30.750
We're stating facts about him, and,
yeah, they happen to be negative,

07:30.817 --> 07:31.989
because he's a bonehead.

07:32.051 --> 07:34.964
Well, I wanted to run an ad that
highlights the good things about me,

07:35.021 --> 07:37.001
not the bad things about
somebody else. Well...

07:37.123 --> 07:40.832
Tom. You are our Communications Director.
Weigh in here.

07:40.993 --> 07:43.667
Leslie, I love your idea.

07:44.163 --> 07:46.439
I also love your idea.

07:46.933 --> 07:49.573
Two great ideas,
two great people.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.338
I don't know
which idea is better.

07:51.437 --> 07:54.384
But I do know I'll end
up on the winning side.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.852
When I bet on horses,
I never lose.

07:57.109 --> 07:58.520
Why?

07:58.578 --> 08:00.353
I bet on all the horses.

08:00.713 --> 08:03.091
How about we do this?
We split up into teams.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.288
We each make a demo
version of our ad.

08:05.351 --> 08:07.422
Whichever one
we like better, we use.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.532
Great idea. As long as
Leslie thinks so, as well.

08:10.590 --> 08:13.264
Sure. I'll pick Ann
and Donna for my team.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.737
You can take Jerry.
What?

08:15.194 --> 08:16.764
Well, you wanted
to go negative.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.900
You got the biggest negative
in the world, buddy.

08:22.134 --> 08:24.114
Okay, everybody,
I need big smiles from you.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.116
We're making
a positive ad here.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.982
So just think of this as
Christmas and your birthday

08:29.041 --> 08:30.850
and the first day of school
all rolled up into one.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.253
Positive is always
better than negative.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.952
Barack Obama said, "Yes, we
can." And now, he's President.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.188
Ben says, "No, we shouldn't." And now
he's working for his girlfriend.

08:39.485 --> 08:42.159
Guys, I need double the smiles. Okay?
Let's take it back again.

08:42.221 --> 08:44.030
And action.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.797
And this is going great.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.600
We're really positive. I think
I'm getting good stuff, right?

08:49.328 --> 08:50.500
What's...

08:52.164 --> 08:53.609
Oh, come on.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.708
Leslie, I think Bobby Newport's
bus is in that shot.

08:56.769 --> 08:57.839
Do you think?

08:58.070 --> 09:01.745
E, H, four, M,

09:01.807 --> 09:05.653
potato shape,
coffee mug shape,

09:05.711 --> 09:08.521
smudge, smudge,
middle finger, smudge.

09:08.581 --> 09:10.026
The rest are all smudges.

09:10.082 --> 09:11.823
Oh, my God.
You drove us here.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.091
We made, like, a hundred
million doctors' appointments

09:14.153 --> 09:15.689
for ourselves
in one week.

09:15.755 --> 09:18.668
After this, we won't have to go to
the doctor for, like, 10 years.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.670
Because we're smart.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.498
Well, you definitely
need glasses.

09:23.596 --> 09:26.042
No, he's not getting glasses.
I like his face the way it is.

09:26.165 --> 09:27.838
If you get glasses,
I'll divorce you.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.446
Well, you heard her, Doc.
Too handsome for glasses.

09:30.603 --> 09:31.843
No offense.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.351
I've got to admit,
his hair game is on point.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.116
I've got to find out what kind of
product he puts up in his hair.

09:38.177 --> 09:40.088
Hey, how's
Leslie's ad going?

09:40.313 --> 09:41.485
It's very good.

09:41.547 --> 09:44.687
But yours is
also very good.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.659
- You ready for the voiceover?
- Yeah.

09:48.054 --> 09:52.525
Bobby Newport's never
had a real job in his life.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.536
You've got to give it more attitude.
It's got to scare people.

09:55.962 --> 09:57.532
Bobby Newport...

09:57.597 --> 09:59.372
Yeah, okay. All right.

10:00.800 --> 10:06.216
Bobby Newport's never
had a real job in his life.

10:06.272 --> 10:10.152
Bobby Newport's never
had a real job in his life.

10:10.209 --> 10:11.882
Bobby Newport.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.116
Bobby Newport.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.556
Bobby Newport.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.184
Bobby Newport.

10:16.248 --> 10:17.989
Bobby Newport.

10:18.050 --> 10:19.324
Newport.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.228
Bobby...
Bobby...

10:21.320 --> 10:23.300
Bobby...
Newport.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.336
All right, now we're
just wasting time, Jerry.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.602
Ron Swanson.
I want to thank you

10:28.661 --> 10:31.471
for being so ruthless and cruel
in the meeting the other day.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.134
You'll have to
be more specific.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.179
With the Public Works
Department, about the dam.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.075
Ah! What do you say I
take you to lunch?

10:37.136 --> 10:38.706
And then we can talk
about all the projects

10:38.771 --> 10:39.943
that you want to
get accomplished.

10:40.006 --> 10:42.680
That won't be necessary.
I don't have any projects.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.085
I hate projects.

10:49.181 --> 10:52.390
What a pill. We should order.
And then we can talk shop.

10:52.451 --> 10:53.555
What are you
going to have?

10:53.619 --> 10:57.032
I'm thinking something raw
and cucumber-based.

10:58.124 --> 10:59.159
A cucumber.

10:59.225 --> 11:02.331
I don't know what happened.
I declined his invitation.

11:02.395 --> 11:05.604
He started laughing, and the next
thing I knew, we were at lunch.

11:06.899 --> 11:08.435
Did he drug me?

11:08.501 --> 11:10.310
Hi, I'm Bobby Newport.

11:10.369 --> 11:13.043
My dad is friends with
John Cougar Mellencamp.

11:13.472 --> 11:14.576
That's pretty cool.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.017
What is this guy
running for?

11:16.075 --> 11:17.918
President of being on every
channel all the time?

11:17.977 --> 11:19.650
Reminder, Leslie.
We have less than

11:19.712 --> 11:21.350
an hour to get
the ad to the station.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.121
Ann, you're beautiful
and you're organized.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.718
So, in order
not to bias anyone,

11:24.817 --> 11:26.660
these are the two ads
that Ben and I made.

11:26.719 --> 11:29.529
I am just going to pick one randomly
and we'll play that one first.

11:29.588 --> 11:30.896
Oh, yay! The awesome one.

11:32.391 --> 11:33.870
Hi, I'm Leslie Knope.

11:33.926 --> 11:37.669
I'm pro-parks, pro-public safety,
and I'm pro-clean water.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.835
I'm also pro-environmental
regulation.

11:39.932 --> 11:44.972
And I'm very, very
pro-local-propositions 45, 86 and 102F.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.540
But most of all,
I'm pro-Pawnee.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.281
Here are some
other things that I'm pro.

12:01.821 --> 12:04.597
As you can see, I'm in
favor of a lot of things.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.931
Like hot dogs.
Right, Charlie?

12:07.727 --> 12:10.173
I'm Leslie Knope,
and I approve this message.

12:10.930 --> 12:13.376
Yes. I love it.
Fantastic.

12:14.266 --> 12:15.438
Do we even want
to screen yours?

12:15.534 --> 12:17.445
Yeah. That was awful.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.881
What do you mean? Name one
thing that was wrong with it.

12:19.939 --> 12:22.715
Okay. You never even mentioned
you were running for office.

12:22.775 --> 12:25.847
You literally never said
the words "City Council."

12:26.345 --> 12:29.189
I didn't... That...
It's implied. I didn't...

12:29.248 --> 12:30.818
We can just put it in.
Okay.

12:30.950 --> 12:33.453
Leslie is so good
at so many things.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.663
And so bad at that.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.797
Bobby Newport's been handed

12:39.859 --> 12:42.135
everything on
a silver platter.

12:42.194 --> 12:45.505
His cushy job at his
dad's candy company?

12:45.965 --> 12:47.205
Handed to him.

12:47.333 --> 12:50.143
His 60-foot boat,
Bobby's Boat?

12:50.870 --> 12:53.407
Handed to him
when he was 12.

12:54.140 --> 12:56.484
Leslie Knope is running
for City Council, too.

12:56.542 --> 12:59.182
And she's earned everything
she's ever gotten.

12:59.245 --> 13:00.315
Yeah, she has.

13:00.379 --> 13:03.383
Bobby Newport wants you to
just hand him this election.

13:03.716 --> 13:04.717
Don't.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.990
I won't.

13:06.385 --> 13:07.420
Yes.

13:07.486 --> 13:08.521
Yes. Yes. I love it.

13:08.587 --> 13:10.999
Now, people,
this is an ad.

13:11.056 --> 13:12.228
It's succinct,
it's punchy...

13:12.291 --> 13:13.326
It's mean.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.167
It's depressing.
It's awful.

13:15.261 --> 13:19.334
I am Ben Wyatt, and I
want to destroy Leslie's dreams.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.504
Okay. If you're allergic to any
food, we'll know in a few days.

13:23.602 --> 13:24.808
I think based
on the redness,

13:24.870 --> 13:27.441
I might be allergic to
getting stabbed by needles.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.543
We have already been to,
like, five different doctors.

13:29.608 --> 13:31.986
I got my ankles micro-waved.
X-rayed.

13:32.044 --> 13:34.650
They took my blood away to use for science.
Cholesterol test.

13:34.713 --> 13:36.317
April had her

13:36.382 --> 13:37.952
sinuses removed?
Looked at.

13:38.017 --> 13:40.623
Some guy looked at my wiener.
Touched it.

13:40.686 --> 13:41.756
That was weird.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.858
And that guy wasn't even a doctor.
That...

13:45.491 --> 13:46.561
What?

13:46.625 --> 13:48.536
Now, I think it is time
for us to take a vote.

13:48.594 --> 13:51.131
So who's in favor
of Ben's ad?

13:51.197 --> 13:52.403
Traitors!

13:52.464 --> 13:54.808
Ann, I painted
your garage pink.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.574
I did not ask you
to do that.

13:56.635 --> 14:00.412
Leslie, look. I want you to win,
and Ben's ad is just better.

14:00.472 --> 14:01.576
Our friendship is over.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.484
No, it's not. It's not over. It's never over.
BFF, I love you forever.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.488
You know what? It seems like
we're kind of evenly split.

14:06.545 --> 14:07.717
I think we should
keep debating.

14:07.780 --> 14:11.489
We're not split. It's unanimous.
We air my ad.

14:11.550 --> 14:12.722
No, I... This is just...

14:12.785 --> 14:14.731
It's just not the way
I dreamed it would be.

14:15.387 --> 14:18.129
This is the right call.
Okay? I promise.

14:18.824 --> 14:19.859
Okay.

14:19.925 --> 14:23.463
I'm going to air a negative ad.
It's out of my hands now.

14:24.763 --> 14:28.336
And you know what? I'm actually
feeling very Zen about this.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.545
Are you Ben Wyatt?
Yeah.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.776
Okay. I need that DVD in the control room.

14:33.739 --> 14:35.116
Oh, my God. Leslie.

14:35.174 --> 14:37.450
I am Leslie Knope, and I do
not approve this message.

14:37.509 --> 14:39.250
What are you doing?
What are you...

14:39.311 --> 14:41.484
Give it to me.
Give me... No.

14:43.515 --> 14:46.860
All right. The good news is there's
only two pieces of bad news.

14:46.986 --> 14:49.227
The bad news is
none of our ads aired,

14:49.288 --> 14:50.631
and we cannot
get our money back.

14:50.990 --> 14:51.991
Oh, God.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.594
There was probably a better
way for you to tell us that.

14:54.660 --> 14:55.934
You both really blew this.

14:55.995 --> 14:59.602
But I can't wait to hear your new ideas.
I love them already.

15:00.299 --> 15:01.642
I'm hungry-

15:01.700 --> 15:03.270
Tommy needs a mango.
See you.

15:05.204 --> 15:06.877
I'm really sorry
I tackled you.

15:06.939 --> 15:11.445
It's just I'd rather run the fake
campaign ads that I made when I was 10

15:11.510 --> 15:13.046
than become
negative and cynical.

15:13.612 --> 15:16.991
Look. I really don't want to
crush your childhood dreams.

15:17.049 --> 15:21.429
But I bet in your dreams, you weren't
losing an election by 70 points.

15:21.687 --> 15:25.191
You need to get tougher,
Leslie. You just have to.

15:26.625 --> 15:29.367
You need to get tougher. You
were pretty easy to take down.

15:30.796 --> 15:31.797
Thanks.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.036
Ron Swanson.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.741
Just the man
I wanted to see.

15:35.801 --> 15:38.338
I'm going to be
going to a seminar

15:38.404 --> 15:40.680
on the art of
the Japanese tea ceremony,

15:40.739 --> 15:43.549
or chagai, at the
Pawnee Community College.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.247
And I thought you might
like to come with me.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.015
Why?

15:47.079 --> 15:48.490
I know how much
you value silence.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.352
A fair point.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.424
But we did just
have lunch last week,

15:52.484 --> 15:54.896
so I feel like we've spent
enough social time together

15:54.954 --> 15:57.332
for the foreseeable ever.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.330
All right. Well, if you change your
mind, you know where to find me.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.639
Donna Meagle.
Chris Traeger.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.072
For some
godforsaken reason,

16:04.129 --> 16:06.837
that man is suddenly
determined to hang on with me.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.276
You mean hang out?

16:08.367 --> 16:10.108
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

16:10.169 --> 16:13.116
He's got you doing Ben's job eating
lunch with him like Ben used to.

16:13.339 --> 16:14.909
Maybe he just misses
his little buddy.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.651
Let's get you home
and get me some ice cream.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.051
Here's your bill.

16:22.114 --> 16:23.650
Oh, yeah. We won't
be needing that.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.218
I've got
the free medicine card.

16:25.851 --> 16:28.229
There's a $500 deductible
for dental procedures.

16:28.287 --> 16:29.994
Oh, I think, you're wrong.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.399
We have the insurance thing.

16:32.458 --> 16:33.528
I believe we're covered.

16:33.592 --> 16:34.627
It's still $500.

16:35.961 --> 16:36.996
Let's see here.

16:37.062 --> 16:39.133
Oh, because...

16:39.198 --> 16:41.508
You know what? Let's go!
Dine and dash.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.410
Out of the way!

16:43.635 --> 16:44.807
Yeah!

16:44.970 --> 16:46.040
Whoo-hoo!

16:46.105 --> 16:47.140
Uh-oh!

16:47.206 --> 16:49.015
Andy!
Call an ambulance!

16:49.408 --> 16:50.580
Andy!
A different ambulance

16:50.642 --> 16:52.349
than the one I ran into!

16:53.545 --> 16:58.016
This is City Council candidate
Leslie Knope, when she was 10 years old.

16:58.083 --> 17:01.121
Hi. I'm Leslie Knope.
I love Pawnee.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.665
And I want to
make it even better.

17:02.788 --> 17:05.358
Better schools,
safer streets,

17:05.424 --> 17:07.926
and a more progressive tax
on residential properties.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.997
This is City Council
candidate Bobby Newport today.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.232
People keep asking me,

17:13.298 --> 17:15.835
"Bobby, what are you going to
do once you get into office?"

17:17.403 --> 17:19.178
I'm pretty sure
I'll figure it out.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.810
Leslie Knope had better
ideas when she was 10

17:22.875 --> 17:25.116
than Bobby Newport has now.

17:25.176 --> 17:26.520
They do have
one thing in common.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.421
I like dogs.
I like dogs.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.757
For a better Pawnee,
vote Knope for City Council.

17:31.817 --> 17:34.263
Well, we already
have a thousand views.

17:34.319 --> 17:37.766
Yeah, but no calls from reporters.
No interview requests.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.530
I don't care.
I'm proud of it.

17:39.591 --> 17:40.626
Are you sure?

17:40.726 --> 17:43.639
Yes. It is accurate
about my opponent. It does not...

17:43.929 --> 17:45.169
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold that thought.

17:45.831 --> 17:48.141
Ron Swanson.
What a pleasant surprise.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.270
And who's this?

17:49.334 --> 17:51.974
This is a great
friend of mine.

17:52.337 --> 17:56.752
He is a fellow who works in
the building, and he is named

17:56.809 --> 17:57.879
Dennis.
Kyle.

17:57.943 --> 18:01.220
He strongly enjoys
Japanese culture.

18:01.447 --> 18:04.394
And I thought he might want
to go with you to the thing.

18:04.450 --> 18:05.861
The tea ceremony?
Yes.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.295
You're a brother
Japanophile?

18:07.352 --> 18:10.390
I was eating rice and Ron
made me come up here.

18:10.856 --> 18:13.393
But, sure, that sounds fun.
Arigatou.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.063
Ron, a moment.

18:16.695 --> 18:19.471
All right, pal. Level with me.
What's going on?

18:19.531 --> 18:22.944
Well, you seemed like
you wanted a friend.

18:24.369 --> 18:27.475
No, no, no.
I am not lonely. I have me.

18:27.673 --> 18:30.244
And 4,000 Facebook friends,
and a hot girlfriend.

18:30.309 --> 18:32.050
I wanted to spend
time with you,

18:32.111 --> 18:34.955
because I have to replace Ben
as Assistant City Manager.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.822
And I was giving you
a try-out of sorts.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.093
Now, I'll mull my options
for the next few months.

18:40.152 --> 18:42.223
But I'd love you to
keep an open mind.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.331
Kyle-san. Arigatou.

18:44.990 --> 18:46.663
Mr. Newport. Hello. Hi.

18:47.626 --> 18:48.764
Leslie Knope. Ben Wyatt.

18:48.827 --> 18:50.170
Yeah. Hi.
Good to see you.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.072
Nice to see you.
You guys want anything?

18:52.131 --> 18:54.077
This is a restaurant,
so they have food and stuff.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.271
I'll take a milkshake.
No, we're good.

18:55.334 --> 18:56.506
We're good.

18:56.568 --> 18:57.808
What can we do for you?

18:57.870 --> 18:59.110
Yes.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.516
Why did you guys post
that video of me, man?

19:02.574 --> 19:04.554
I mean, that didn't
make me feel good.

19:04.610 --> 19:07.352
It was mean.
You guys are mean.

19:08.380 --> 19:12.089
Well, we used your own ad,
so I don't think it was mean.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.960
All right.
Let me lay it out for you.

19:14.019 --> 19:15.692
My friends keep
sending me links

19:15.754 --> 19:17.734
to that video and they
just make fun of me.

19:17.890 --> 19:18.925
So just...

19:19.158 --> 19:22.196
Stop running, okay?
Just, that... Stop.

19:22.461 --> 19:23.599
Stop running the ad?

19:23.662 --> 19:25.266
No, stop running
the campaign.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.275
What?
Just quit.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.812
It would be so cool of
you if you just quit.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.812
Then I can win the election
and I'll have a big party.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.477
And I'll put you both
on the guest list, plus one.

19:35.874 --> 19:37.615
I'm going to have
a man who does magic.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.814
He's really good.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.118
Not, like, cheesy magic.
Like, good magic.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.161
We're not going to
quit the campaign.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.991
Why would we do that?

19:46.051 --> 19:47.223
Because.

19:48.053 --> 19:49.999
I want it.
Come on. Give me it.

19:50.389 --> 19:53.131
Give me it. Give me it.
Come on. Give me it.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.967
Just give me the election.
I'm sorry.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.700
Please. Please.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.540
Well, Leslie, he does make
a compelling argument.

19:59.598 --> 20:02.078
Come on.
 Come on.

20:02.134 --> 20:03.169
Guy...

20:03.235 --> 20:04.270
Bobby.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.679
Oh, it's not padded.

20:05.737 --> 20:06.772
Can I ask you a question?

20:06.838 --> 20:08.579
Why are you even
running for office?

20:08.640 --> 20:11.519
You know what? I need something
to do to get my dad off my back.

20:11.577 --> 20:12.783
This seemed easy.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.749
What about you? Why are you doing it?
Who's your dad?

20:15.881 --> 20:18.054
I'm running for office, because
I want to improve the lives

20:18.116 --> 20:19.527
of the people that
I love in the city

20:19.585 --> 20:20.928
that's the greatest city
in the world.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.760
What? What does
that even mean?

20:22.821 --> 20:25.893
Hey. I've got an idea.
How about you quit running,

20:25.958 --> 20:29.337
then I win, but then I
let you do all the work?

20:29.528 --> 20:32.668
I'm not going anywhere. And
we are going to debate soon.

20:32.764 --> 20:34.971
And I need to warn you.
I know my stuff.

20:36.034 --> 20:37.911
So you should toughen up.

20:40.672 --> 20:43.016
Why are you guys smiling?
I feel bad.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.681
Hey, quick question That
little girl from your video?

20:45.744 --> 20:46.984
Oh, my God.
She's so cute.

20:47.045 --> 20:50.151
Do you think you could talk to
her and let her do an ad for me?

20:50.716 --> 20:52.127
That girl is me.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.326
As a 10-year-old.

20:55.754 --> 20:56.926
How did you do that?

20:58.557 --> 21:00.901
Maybe we should see
one of the other doctors.

21:01.159 --> 21:02.934
No. No more doctors.

21:03.161 --> 21:04.936
They're a bunch
of scam artists.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.874
They reel you in
with the free stuff,

21:06.932 --> 21:08.741
and the next thing
you know, bam,

21:08.800 --> 21:10.575
you run into an ambulance.

21:11.136 --> 21:12.638
Every time.

21:12.704 --> 21:14.650
Let's just go home
and care for each other.

21:14.706 --> 21:17.186
We can buy a sewing kit
and you can sew up my lip

21:17.242 --> 21:18.778
underneath
a bridge somewhere.

21:19.544 --> 21:20.784
That's so romantic.

21:20.979 --> 21:22.219
Oh.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.817
Sorry, I forgot.

21:23.882 --> 21:25.190
Let's go.
All right.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.196
Do you think sewing kits
are covered by insurance?

21:27.252 --> 21:29.232
Or groceries?
Or, like, Xbox games?

21:29.288 --> 21:31.859
What is insurance?
I don't know. Who cares?
