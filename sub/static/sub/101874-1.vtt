00:37.922 --> 00:41.625
<i>I wanna tell you about
my best friend in the world.</i>

00:43.326 --> 00:44.896
<i>That's a Canon C 300.</i>

00:46.296 --> 00:48.198
<i>It's being operated by Arsene,
our first camera operator.</i>

00:50.702 --> 00:53.503
<i>They concurrently are being shot
by Alvira Lynne,</i>

00:53.537 --> 00:55.439
<i>our B camera operator.</i>

01:03.748 --> 01:05.549
I'm an actress.

01:06.951 --> 01:08.618
I mean, I'm acting right now.

01:09.887 --> 01:12.724
Normally, I'm a dancer
and a choreographer.

01:14.025 --> 01:16.626
I'm acting in this
because given all the dancing

01:16.661 --> 01:18.428
that's going to be happening,

01:18.462 --> 01:19.864
we thought it'd be more viable
for the dancers to pull off

01:19.897 --> 01:21.699
the acting required,

01:21.933 --> 01:22.800
than vice versa.

01:24.534 --> 01:25.937
I didn't write these words.

01:27.404 --> 01:28.706
They are written

01:28.740 --> 01:31.008
by what we as species
commonly refer to as a man.

01:31.809 --> 01:34.311
And the part I'll be playing,

01:34.344 --> 01:35.612
or playing the part of,

01:36.513 --> 01:39.349
is also,
for purposes of identification,

01:39.717 --> 01:40.617
a man.

01:42.486 --> 01:43.788
<i>My name is Eden.</i>

01:46.623 --> 01:47.992
<i>That's me on the bed.</i>

01:51.561 --> 01:52.730
<i>And that...</i>

01:54.498 --> 01:55.599
<i>is Aviva,</i>

01:57.969 --> 02:00.671
<i>who wasn't aware all
these cameras would be here</i>

02:00.705 --> 02:02.907
<i>when we were introduced
by our common friend Nissan.</i>

02:06.244 --> 02:07.277
<i>Nissan is a man about town in
about a dozen different towns,</i>

02:07.310 --> 02:10.614
<i>New York, London,
Berlin, Barcelona, Paris.</i>

02:12.382 --> 02:14.384
<i>He speaks seven
or eight languages fluently,</i>

02:14.417 --> 02:15.887
<i>and each one of them,</i>

02:15.920 --> 02:18.723
<i>with whatever a loosh affected
accent is in that language.</i>

02:18.756 --> 02:20.992
<i>He's flamboyant,
though straight, and that heart,</i>

02:21.025 --> 02:24.061
<i>kind of a yenta who's always
looking to play matchmaker.</i>

02:24.561 --> 02:25.997
<i>He was living in
Paris at the time</i>

02:26.030 --> 02:28.666
<i>and was friends with Aviva,
who was a native there.</i>

02:29.100 --> 02:30.835
I'm a dancer, too.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.906
Not exactly French, but...

02:34.939 --> 02:36.606
an accent is an accent.

02:40.778 --> 02:42.546
<i>Nissan tried
to set Aviva up</i>

02:42.579 --> 02:44.447
<i>with some of his friends there.</i>

02:44.481 --> 02:45.950
<i>For whatever reason,</i>

02:45.983 --> 02:47.051
<i>nothing clicked.</i>

02:47.652 --> 02:49.553
<i>Then he thought of me.</i>

02:50.888 --> 02:52.489
<i>Living in New York,</i>

02:52.522 --> 02:54.391
<i>still reeling from
a devastating break up,</i>

02:54.424 --> 02:57.028
<i>to which my suicidal response
had led me to understand</i>

02:57.061 --> 02:59.831
<i>that I was dealing with
a deep and abiding depression</i>

02:59.864 --> 03:01.933
<i>I had been carrying
my entire life.</i>

03:03.768 --> 03:06.336
<i>And there's nothing
more depressing or lonely</i>

03:06.536 --> 03:08.673
<i>than being alone
in New York City.</i>

03:11.608 --> 03:13.978
<i>Nissan told me about
this amazing creature</i>

03:14.011 --> 03:15.512
<i>I had to meet right away.</i>

03:16.113 --> 03:19.382
<i>I was reluctant at first,
but after some convincing,</i>

03:19.684 --> 03:21.853
<i>I sent an email off
in to the Ether.</i>

03:22.186 --> 03:23.587
<i>It went like this:</i>

03:24.822 --> 03:26.891
<i>"Hey there Aviva
across the ocean,</i>

03:28.458 --> 03:29.526
<i>Eden here.</i>

03:29.559 --> 03:30.895
<i>I'm a friend of Nissan's.</i>

03:31.729 --> 03:33.698
<i>He told me I absolutely
must email you,</i>

03:33.731 --> 03:35.465
<i>which I'm very happy to do.</i>

03:36.033 --> 03:37.702
<i>I'm not sure what to say,</i>

03:37.735 --> 03:39.871
<i>but Nissan, I don't know
what you did to him,</i>

03:39.904 --> 03:41.638
<i>but it must have been something,</i>

03:41.672 --> 03:43.007
<i>was so emphatic</i>

03:43.040 --> 03:44.742
<i>that he almost got me
to get on a plane</i>

03:44.775 --> 03:47.111
<i>and come to Paris for some
event or I don't know what,</i>

03:47.144 --> 03:48.612
<i>this weekend.</i>

03:49.881 --> 03:52.482
<i>Unfortunately, I have to finish
this project I'm working on.</i>

03:52.515 --> 03:55.452
<i>I'm on a deadline so I really
can't do it right now.</i>

03:55.920 --> 03:59.422
<i>However, one of these days
I'll be out there.</i>

04:00.858 --> 04:02.392
<i>Do you ever leave Paris?</i>

04:02.860 --> 04:04.561
<i>What are you up to anyway?</i>

04:04.896 --> 04:05.897
<i>What do you do?</i>

04:06.630 --> 04:07.965
<i>Who are you actually?</i>

04:08.933 --> 04:11.936
<i>I'm a poor 76-year-old
Satmar Yeshiva student</i>

04:11.969 --> 04:13.905
<i>with a dead wife
and 14 children.</i>

04:13.938 --> 04:16.506
<i>The oldest of which
is already a grandfather.</i>

04:16.539 --> 04:18.075
<i>I live in Ustedalen, Krakow,</i>

04:18.109 --> 04:20.711
<i>if you are interested in
pursuing a correspondence,</i>

04:20.745 --> 04:23.014
<i>please email me back, E."</i>

04:23.047 --> 04:24.749
<i>And Aviva responded,</i>

04:25.816 --> 04:26.918
<i>"Dear E,</i>

04:27.752 --> 04:28.819
<i>Sounds good.</i>

04:29.120 --> 04:30.922
<i>I'm a 60-year-old virgin.</i>

04:31.488 --> 04:34.557
<i>Blind as a bat from a horrible
accident I had last year</i>

04:34.591 --> 04:36.526
<i>while cleaning my cat's claws.</i>

04:37.695 --> 04:38.930
<i>I have 61 cats.</i>

04:39.730 --> 04:42.133
<i>One for every year
of disappointment.</i>

04:44.936 --> 04:46.536
<i>I have a voice of a bird,</i>

04:46.837 --> 04:47.838
<i>one great boob,</i>

04:48.773 --> 04:49.439
<i>lost the other one
to cancer, and...</i>

04:49.472 --> 04:51.943
<i>got</i> two <i>cats that year</i>

04:52.642 --> 04:54.946
<i>and an appetite
for new experiences.</i>

04:55.846 --> 04:59.016
<i>Nissan kindly offered his help
in ending my curiosity</i>

04:59.283 --> 05:03.453
<i>and I guess you are his idea
of a perfect man for this job.</i>

05:07.191 --> 05:10.227
<i>Unfortunately,
with every moment that passes,</i>

05:10.261 --> 05:12.663
<i>my heart loses a little
bit of innocence,</i>

05:13.030 --> 05:16.767
<i>so I cannot offer you the love
I had in me on Wednesday.</i>

05:18.002 --> 05:19.070
<i>But</i>

05:20.071 --> 05:21.205
<i>I think I'll still be
happy to meet you,</i>

05:21.706 --> 05:22.940
<i>and your children.</i>

05:24.809 --> 05:25.876
<i>And who knows,</i>

05:26.243 --> 05:27.878
<i>maybe we'll fall in love</i>

05:27.912 --> 05:30.513
<i>and learn that life
is full of surprises.</i>

05:32.316 --> 05:34.051
<i>Waiting to hear more about you,</i>

05:35.086 --> 05:36.153
<i>A."</i>

06:50.227 --> 06:53.596
<i>We quickly recognized
one another as kindred spirits</i>

06:53.630 --> 06:57.168
<i>and our desire to explore
and express our deepest selves.</i>

06:57.802 --> 06:58.903
<i>At least in words.</i>

07:04.208 --> 07:06.677
<i>And so we created an
imaginary space together.</i>

07:07.078 --> 07:10.214
<i>A space outside of time
and space, shared only by us.</i>

07:10.915 --> 07:14.251
<i>Like two shipwrecked survivors
on a desert island,</i>

07:16.387 --> 07:18.756
<i>in old-fashioned letter
writing romance,</i>

07:18.789 --> 07:22.193
<i>propelled in to hyper speed by
the actuality of the internet.</i>

07:26.363 --> 07:28.666
<i>After a few months
of correspondence</i>

07:28.699 --> 07:31.001
<i>we graduated
to phone conversations.</i>

07:33.003 --> 07:35.072
<i>These were somewhat
more problematic,</i>

07:35.106 --> 07:36.707
<i>as elements of our personalities</i>

07:36.740 --> 07:38.275
<i>that had been hidden
under the disguise</i>

07:38.309 --> 07:40.077
<i>provided by the written word,</i>

07:40.111 --> 07:42.980
<i>were exposed by the demands
of spoken communication.</i>

07:45.249 --> 07:48.285
<i>Aviva's assertiveness
and impatience took me aback.</i>

07:49.186 --> 07:50.921
<i>And my pessimism</i>

07:50.955 --> 07:52.823
<i>and need to denigrate myself
in relationships in general</i>

07:52.857 --> 07:54.992
<i>forced their way through
my better judgment</i>

07:55.025 --> 07:56.293
<i>and on to my tongue.</i>

08:00.064 --> 08:01.799
<i>But for all that</i>

08:01.832 --> 08:03.234
<i>our digital romance
ran hot and strong</i>

08:03.434 --> 08:05.336
<i>and Aviva decided
to pack a suitcase</i>

08:05.369 --> 08:07.738
<i>and venture forth
to visit me for a week</i>

08:08.305 --> 08:11.242
<i>and see what it would
be like to connect in person.</i>

08:24.755 --> 08:27.691
There we go.

08:28.125 --> 08:29.260
Good, sweetie.

08:30.961 --> 08:32.129
Aviva.

08:41.138 --> 08:42.806
Oh, hi.

08:50.181 --> 08:52.316
Yeah, baby. Oh!

08:52.349 --> 08:55.252
Oh, that's it. Yes. Yes, oh.

09:07.097 --> 09:09.433
Come on, Eden.
You're a big boy.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.101
You can do it, come on.

09:17.341 --> 09:19.777
Come on, give a small pee-pee.

09:20.878 --> 09:22.079
You can do it.

09:28.085 --> 09:29.086
Aviva!

09:32.156 --> 09:33.090
No.

09:49.406 --> 09:51.442
Well,
it's just frustrating...

10:51.902 --> 10:53.203
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

11:31.408 --> 11:32.976
Aviva!

11:35.012 --> 11:36.847
Close the door Eden, come on.

12:38.375 --> 12:39.376
<i>Hello?</i>

12:39.410 --> 12:40.377
<i>Hey.</i>

12:40.411 --> 12:41.713
<i>Uh, it's Eden.</i>

12:41.746 --> 12:42.913
<i>I know.</i>

12:43.981 --> 12:45.082
<i>Well, hello.</i>

12:45.115 --> 12:46.583
<i>You sound so different.</i>

12:47.217 --> 12:48.218
<i>Than what?</i>

12:48.252 --> 12:50.320
<i>Than I expected.</i>

12:50.587 --> 12:52.022
<i>How so?</i>

12:53.457 --> 12:55.459
<i>You sound so American.</i>

12:55.492 --> 12:58.228
<i>I am so American,
what did you expect?</i>

12:58.262 --> 12:59.997
<i>I don't know...</i>

13:00.030 --> 13:01.565
<i>do I sound different?</i>

13:01.598 --> 13:04.301
<i>You sound pretty
much the way I expected.</i>

13:04.334 --> 13:06.136
<i>Is it a good
moment to talk?</i>

13:06.170 --> 13:08.138
<i>Always a good
moment to talk to you.</i>

13:08.172 --> 13:10.207
<i>The time difference
is killing me.</i>

13:10.240 --> 13:11.608
<i>You have to meet my father.</i>

13:11.642 --> 13:13.711
<i>I never get along
with fathers.</i>

13:13.745 --> 13:16.681
<i>You will love him,
he's the smartest and funniest.</i>

13:16.714 --> 13:19.383
- <i>I'm a romanticist.</i>
- <i>Yeah until now.</i>

13:19.416 --> 13:22.553
<i>I think I'm a realist,
at least so far as...</i>

13:22.586 --> 13:24.455
<i>Neither is
a philosophy, just an emotion.</i>

13:25.289 --> 13:27.057
<i>I don't think
it's always smart</i>

13:27.090 --> 13:28.625
<i>to talk about everything,</i>

13:28.660 --> 13:29.960
<i>especially love,</i>

13:30.294 --> 13:31.562
<i>or past lovers.</i>

13:31.595 --> 13:33.263
<i>Why is that off limits?</i>

13:34.097 --> 13:36.567
<i>It's just better
to start new things, new.</i>

13:37.669 --> 13:40.137
<i>Tired of talking,
we need to meet.</i>

13:40.471 --> 13:42.674
<i>Yeah, so I'm coming.</i>

13:43.307 --> 13:45.242
<i>I already
bought the tickets.</i>

13:45.275 --> 13:46.343
<i>You did?</i>

13:46.610 --> 13:47.611
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

13:48.880 --> 13:51.281
- <i>You're really coming?</i>
- <i>I'm coming,</i>

13:51.716 --> 13:52.750
<i>I'm really coming.</i>

14:24.381 --> 14:26.751
<i>Sweet Aviva
across the ocean,</i>

14:27.819 --> 14:30.587
I'm so excited to finally
see you face to face.

14:31.421 --> 14:34.291
Though I admit
to equally being afraid of it.

14:35.325 --> 14:38.529
<i>It's all fun and games until
I actually have to be there.</i>

14:44.334 --> 14:45.737
Is this your usual place?

14:49.774 --> 14:51.308
I don't know.

14:51.341 --> 14:52.209
You don't know?

14:52.977 --> 14:54.411
If I say it is,
and you're asking

14:54.444 --> 14:56.681
because you don't like it,
then I lose points.

14:57.447 --> 15:00.083
If you like it and I say
it isn't, I lose points.

15:00.117 --> 15:01.719
If you like it and I say yes,

15:01.753 --> 15:04.321
- I gain points...
- You're over thinking this.

15:10.527 --> 15:12.262
You know,

15:13.130 --> 15:14.531
I'm in town only for a few days

15:15.465 --> 15:18.635
and I know that we've known
each other for a while

15:19.269 --> 15:21.305
well, from across
the ocean anyway, but...

15:23.273 --> 15:24.742
I think it's best if we

15:24.776 --> 15:27.344
let the physical
take its own course.

15:27.879 --> 15:30.347
Not to push things right away.

16:09.721 --> 16:11.254
Where are you?

16:13.190 --> 16:14.524
Why don't you look at me?

16:14.558 --> 16:15.893
I'm looking at you.

16:17.561 --> 16:18.696
You're not looking at me.

16:18.730 --> 16:20.397
I'm looking at you.

16:23.935 --> 16:26.838
Look at me, in my eyes.

16:27.437 --> 16:28.572
Your eyes?

16:33.945 --> 16:35.880
Can't you make eye contact?

16:37.648 --> 16:38.783
Yeah, I mean...

16:39.616 --> 16:40.652
sure.

16:42.920 --> 16:43.955
Can I blink?

16:43.988 --> 16:45.455
Forget it.

16:45.489 --> 16:46.623
What?

16:47.659 --> 16:49.593
I can't do it if you're
going to make fun of me.

16:49.626 --> 16:51.896
I'm looking at your eyes.
That's what you asked me to do.

16:51.929 --> 16:53.931
- Not like that.
- Not like what?

16:54.431 --> 16:57.367
There's only one way to
look into someone's eyes.

16:57.401 --> 16:58.703
No, there's not.

16:59.403 --> 17:01.638
You think I don't see
what you're doing?

17:01.906 --> 17:03.340
What am I doing?

17:03.775 --> 17:05.409
I don't know.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.879
Taking a little look
at me here, my shoulder

17:07.912 --> 17:09.947
my neck, my foot maybe.

17:10.982 --> 17:13.851
Taking pictures of
things that turn you on.

17:13.885 --> 17:16.286
Fit in to some type of
pre-programmed sequence

17:16.319 --> 17:18.588
of triggers you're used
to responding to,

17:18.856 --> 17:20.858
making a pornographic
movie in your head

17:20.892 --> 17:23.593
and playing it even when
I'm right here, with you.

17:23.627 --> 17:24.762
Hey.

17:24.796 --> 17:26.698
Take it easy, okay?

17:28.298 --> 17:29.934
This is that moment when I
wonder

17:29.967 --> 17:32.302
what really happened to you
when you were a child.

17:32.335 --> 17:34.739
You know everything there
is to know about my childhood

17:34.772 --> 17:37.474
and it has nothing
to do with this.

17:38.341 --> 17:40.745
We really shouldn't have
written to each other so much

17:40.778 --> 17:42.245
before meeting in person.

17:42.947 --> 17:45.515
Do you regret getting
to know each other?

17:45.717 --> 17:47.250
I regret that all those words

17:47.284 --> 17:48.686
made us think we know
each other,

17:48.720 --> 17:49.854
when we really don't.

17:51.354 --> 17:52.657
So tell me I'm wrong.

17:52.690 --> 17:53.825
That's what I'm saying.

17:53.858 --> 17:55.258
No, look me in the eyes and...

17:55.292 --> 17:57.627
Jesus, with the eyes, already.

17:59.296 --> 18:00.865
<i>Something I
never told Aviva,</i>

18:03.600 --> 18:06.436
<i>once when I was a child,
maybe four years old,</i>

18:06.470 --> 18:08.638
<i>my mother took me
to play in the park.</i>

18:10.440 --> 18:14.011
<i>And in those days, you know,
the park was perfect.</i>

18:14.912 --> 18:16.446
<i>A golden realm,</i>

18:16.480 --> 18:18.850
<i>suspended between
innocence and knowledge.</i>

18:19.649 --> 18:20.952
<i>A perfect place.</i>

18:22.385 --> 18:24.655
<i>I met another kid there,
about my age.</i>

18:25.823 --> 18:28.525
<i>We both had bikes
and we bonded instantly.</i>

18:30.627 --> 18:32.764
<i>We made a connection
stronger than anything</i>

18:32.797 --> 18:35.499
<i>I normally experienced
with someone I just met.</i>

18:37.334 --> 18:38.836
<i>Our parents
must have sensed this,</i>

18:38.870 --> 18:41.038
<i>because my mother,
who was usually in a rush,</i>

18:41.072 --> 18:43.406
<i>let us play together
for a long time.</i>

18:45.843 --> 18:47.577
<i>It was heaven.</i>

18:48.946 --> 18:50.715
<i>But then, at some point,</i>

18:51.548 --> 18:54.351
<i>I noticed something
that struck me as strange.</i>

19:02.059 --> 19:03.728
Your shoes are red.

19:04.361 --> 19:05.029
Yeah.

19:05.797 --> 19:07.665
Pretty weird for a boy.

19:07.999 --> 19:10.534
I'm not a boy, I'm a girl.

19:11.635 --> 19:13.370
<i>I was stunned,</i>

19:13.403 --> 19:14.071
<i>betrayed.</i>

19:14.939 --> 19:15.572
<i>I felt like the bedrock
of reality</i>

19:15.605 --> 19:17.842
<i>had shifted under my feet.</i>

19:25.582 --> 19:26.717
<i>And that was that.</i>

19:28.786 --> 19:29.921
<i>Paradise lost.</i>

19:31.621 --> 19:32.890
When will you be back?

19:34.058 --> 19:35.827
I don't know, not too late.

19:37.061 --> 19:39.130
I don't understand
why I can't come.

19:39.163 --> 19:41.565
It's not that you can't,
it's just...

19:42.432 --> 19:43.633
Aviva.

19:45.937 --> 19:48.471
I moved here three months ago.

19:48.940 --> 19:51.676
When I flew back to Paris
after my first visit,

19:52.143 --> 19:53.811
I wasn't sure about things

19:54.544 --> 19:57.347
but as soon as the space
between us opened up

19:57.782 --> 20:01.351
our love poured back in
and filled it up.

20:01.786 --> 20:03.486
So I closed my apartment

20:03.955 --> 20:06.356
and moved to America, for love.

20:06.924 --> 20:09.760
I feel the need to clarify that,
because, you know,

20:09.794 --> 20:12.129
my friends at home
and people here, they're like,

20:12.163 --> 20:15.398
"If you make it work
with Eden for three years

20:15.800 --> 20:17.168
you'll get a green card."

20:17.201 --> 20:18.468
And I'm like,

20:19.569 --> 20:21.138
"I don't give a fuck about
the fucking green card!

20:21.172 --> 20:23.975
I don't give a fuck about
this disgusting country,

20:24.008 --> 20:26.978
I don't give a fuck about
becoming a fucking American."

20:27.011 --> 20:28.445
I came here

20:28.478 --> 20:29.546
for only one reason.

20:29.579 --> 20:30.580
Aviva,

20:31.716 --> 20:34.517
you know all my friends
and they all think you're great,

20:34.785 --> 20:37.487
I just need some time out
with the guys sometimes.

20:37.722 --> 20:38.689
Know what I mean?

20:38.723 --> 20:39.657
No.

20:39.991 --> 20:41.591
What do you mean, no?

20:41.625 --> 20:43.761
I mean what can you talk about
with your friends alone,

20:43.794 --> 20:45.997
that you can't talk
about with me there?

20:46.030 --> 20:47.530
You, for starters.

20:48.065 --> 20:50.034
What are you going
to say about me?

20:50.500 --> 20:51.736
I'm not...

20:52.937 --> 20:55.006
It's not like I have
anything planned.

20:55.039 --> 20:57.540
I just need some
perspective sometimes.

21:01.879 --> 21:03.580
Who's going to be there?

21:04.248 --> 21:05.582
I don't know.

21:06.851 --> 21:08.886
Mason, for sure.

21:09.586 --> 21:12.589
Dave Mazolla, Aaron Butts,

21:12.622 --> 21:14.959
Kieren, Tony Takata,

21:15.726 --> 21:17.161
you know, Mason's usual gang.

21:18.763 --> 21:20.965
You just don't want me
to come because you're in love

21:20.998 --> 21:22.099
with Mason.

21:22.733 --> 21:24.534
I'm not in love
with Mason,

21:24.567 --> 21:26.103
he's my best friend

21:26.137 --> 21:28.806
and sometimes I just need
some alone time with him.

21:29.206 --> 21:30.808
Is that okay with you?

21:32.143 --> 21:34.178
Go. Have fun.

21:34.812 --> 21:36.881
Be gay with Mason
and your usual gang,

21:36.914 --> 21:39.449
I'll stay home and watch
something on TV.

21:40.718 --> 21:43.054
- Where's Mason at?
- Ah, fuck Mason.

21:43.087 --> 21:46.556
You think Eden would hang
with us if Mason wasn't here?

21:48.125 --> 21:50.728
Girl's got him
under lock and keys.

21:50.761 --> 21:52.229
She's fine though.

21:56.667 --> 21:58.601
Super powers.

22:00.071 --> 22:03.207
X-Men, F.F.
were hit by cosmic rays.

22:03.908 --> 22:06.077
- Mason!
- Mason!

Aviva?

27:04.141 --> 27:05.409
I'm home.

27:17.454 --> 27:18.455
Hey.

27:19.189 --> 27:20.958
I was just about to go to sleep.

27:20.991 --> 27:23.294
Aviva, I'm sorry you could've
come, it's just the guys...

27:23.327 --> 27:24.295
It's all right.

27:25.529 --> 27:27.931
I'm sorry, too. I know you need
to breathe once in a while.

27:27.965 --> 27:29.600
I actually got a lot done.

27:29.633 --> 27:32.836
I made a lot of phone calls, set
up some things for this week.

27:33.103 --> 27:34.605
I've been sitting
on my ass too long.

27:34.638 --> 27:36.073
Waiting for things to happen.

27:36.106 --> 27:37.241
You've been adjusting.

27:37.274 --> 27:38.542
No, that's not it.

27:39.043 --> 27:40.944
You don't know, you never
really saw me at home.

27:40.978 --> 27:43.314
I'm always making things happen,
almost too much.

27:43.347 --> 27:44.815
Go, go, go all the time.

27:45.382 --> 27:47.518
You know my friends wouldn't
even recognize me.

27:49.153 --> 27:51.188
Something happened
when I came here.

27:54.058 --> 27:56.026
But enough is enough, no?

27:58.062 --> 27:59.296
I'm back.

28:13.110 --> 28:15.312
Pull me, pull me like this hard.

28:21.518 --> 28:22.453
Coming.

28:34.598 --> 28:36.100
That was fast.

28:36.400 --> 28:37.534
Yeah.

28:37.568 --> 28:39.536
That's how I am normally
when I'm happy.

28:40.204 --> 28:41.438
It's amazing.

28:48.245 --> 28:49.513
- Come on.
- What?

28:50.247 --> 28:52.483
I want you to finish, too.
Come on.

28:52.516 --> 28:53.550
Okay.

28:54.017 --> 28:55.619
What are you doing?

28:56.420 --> 28:58.188
- Can I get on top again?
- Why?

28:58.222 --> 28:59.123
I...

28:59.957 --> 29:02.426
- I just don't finish like this.
- Like what?

29:03.193 --> 29:04.328
When I'm...

29:04.361 --> 29:06.163
when I'm on the bottom.

29:06.196 --> 29:07.498
You don't?

29:07.531 --> 29:09.166
You can't or you don't want to?

29:09.199 --> 29:10.934
Just, I won't, okay?

29:11.235 --> 29:12.469
How do you know?

29:13.303 --> 29:14.905
'Cos I know myself.

29:15.372 --> 29:17.474
- You know yourself?
- Yeah.

29:18.008 --> 29:19.376
Doesn't seem so to me.

29:20.745 --> 29:23.180
You know for someone
who just had a nice orgasm

29:23.213 --> 29:25.983
in record time and expressed
the desire to return the favor,

29:26.016 --> 29:27.618
you have an odd
way of showing it.

29:27.651 --> 29:30.521
- I'm sorry. You're right.
- No you're not.

29:30.554 --> 29:31.989
I'm sorry, come here.

29:32.022 --> 29:33.658
- Forget it.
- Come on, I'm sorry.

29:33.691 --> 29:36.160
Look, it's not gonna happen,
okay?

29:37.662 --> 29:38.595
Forget it.

29:54.344 --> 29:56.013
<i>I had
a perfect place once, too.</i>

29:56.046 --> 29:57.281
<i>And not so long ago.</i>

30:01.285 --> 30:02.519
<i>It was a room.</i>

30:03.187 --> 30:04.388
<i>A white room.</i>

30:04.421 --> 30:05.956
<i>Everything was white.</i>

30:07.124 --> 30:08.425
<i>The walls, the bed,</i>

30:09.526 --> 30:11.128
<i>the covering on the furniture.</i>

30:11.763 --> 30:13.564
<i>The shades were white</i>

30:13.597 --> 30:16.066
<i>and the light that came in
through the window was white.</i>

30:16.768 --> 30:18.569
<i>The reason it
was perfect, though,</i>

30:19.169 --> 30:20.705
<i>was that Phillippe was in it.</i>

30:22.473 --> 30:24.074
<i>I met him in the Marais.</i>

30:26.376 --> 30:29.213
<i>He was serving falafel
at this place called Che Habib.</i>

30:29.613 --> 30:31.615
<i>People stand
in line for an hour.</i>

30:34.218 --> 30:35.419
<i>He was so beautiful.</i>

30:36.453 --> 30:38.555
<i>Black hair, black eyes.</i>

30:39.089 --> 30:40.624
<i>He had just come from Morocco.</i>

30:41.158 --> 30:43.060
<i>A Jew, like me.</i>

30:47.732 --> 30:50.334
<i>I never thought he
would be interested in me,</i>

30:50.367 --> 30:51.435
<i>but he was.</i>

30:52.569 --> 30:54.371
<i>It's true, we didn't have
very much to talk about,</i>

30:54.571 --> 30:56.373
<i>but we didn't need to talk.</i>

31:13.290 --> 31:14.792
<i>He lived with his family</i>

31:14.826 --> 31:17.060
<i>and I lived with a few
girlfriends in the Tenth.</i>

31:17.094 --> 31:19.363
<i>So I found us
an apartment of our own,</i>

31:19.396 --> 31:20.597
<i>just a room, really.</i>

31:20.631 --> 31:21.766
<i>But it was ours,</i>

31:22.466 --> 31:23.567
<i>our white room.</i>

31:52.329 --> 31:53.630
<i>I had been hurting myself.</i>

31:54.531 --> 31:56.466
<i>Cutting myself, for years.</i>

31:57.601 --> 31:59.136
<i>And when he kissed me,</i>

31:59.737 --> 32:01.673
<i>the scars in my flesh remained,</i>

32:02.439 --> 32:04.842
<i>but the wounds in my heart
and soul were healed.</i>

32:05.442 --> 32:08.178
<i>And I was filled with
a light more pure and white</i>

32:08.478 --> 32:10.715
<i>than the light filling
our perfect room.</i>

32:13.885 --> 32:16.520
<i>We lived for each other,
or at least</i>

32:16.921 --> 32:18.322
<i>I lived for him.</i>

32:18.856 --> 32:20.457
<i>I stopped almost everything.</i>

32:20.758 --> 32:22.459
<i>I hardly saw my family,</i>

32:22.894 --> 32:24.127
<i>my friends,</i>

32:25.095 --> 32:27.364
<i>I worked just enough
to help us get by.</i>

32:28.298 --> 32:30.267
<i>I cooked, I cleaned,</i>

32:30.300 --> 32:32.369
<i>I made sure our
room was spotless.</i>

32:40.177 --> 32:41.244
I guess I lied,

32:42.512 --> 32:45.449
when I say my friends wouldn't
recognize me here in New York.

32:48.185 --> 32:50.220
They would recognize
me very well.

32:51.221 --> 32:52.824
How I am when I'm trying to...

32:53.323 --> 32:54.324
Trying to what?

32:56.193 --> 32:57.394
Experience love.

32:58.930 --> 33:02.366
You feel like you have to give
up who you are in order to love?

33:04.568 --> 33:07.337
In order to experience
love in return, yeah.

33:08.773 --> 33:12.275
You think no-one will love you,
if they know who you are?

33:13.577 --> 33:14.645
I don't know.

33:20.250 --> 33:21.351
Do you love me?

33:26.289 --> 33:27.357
Aviva.

33:29.593 --> 33:30.695
You okay?

33:31.328 --> 33:32.596
I should be asking you that.

33:32.629 --> 33:33.497
Me?

33:35.232 --> 33:36.466
You were angry.

33:37.334 --> 33:39.369
It's okay. Everything's back to
normal.

33:39.403 --> 33:40.972
Sorry, I should open a window.

33:41.005 --> 33:42.539
What are you thinking about?

33:44.307 --> 33:46.878
Nothing, everything, you know?

33:47.845 --> 33:49.714
I was thinking about Phillippe.

33:53.483 --> 33:54.584
What about him?

33:55.619 --> 33:57.955
Actually, I was thinking
more about me with him.

33:58.622 --> 34:00.624
Why I'm always
the same when I'm...

34:00.958 --> 34:03.326
- When you're what?
- In a relationship.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.763
- Everything's a relationship.
- With men.

34:07.699 --> 34:09.801
I'm glad to know I
inspire a generalized

34:09.834 --> 34:12.602
Pavlovian reaction
to an entire gender.

34:12.636 --> 34:14.604
And you think you're
different with me

34:14.638 --> 34:16.640
than you are with any
other woman you attract?

34:17.942 --> 34:20.610
You never said why you
and Phillippe broke up.

34:20.644 --> 34:21.511
I told you.

34:22.345 --> 34:23.613
No, you said you
were heartbroken,

34:23.881 --> 34:25.582
you moved back
with your parents,

34:25.615 --> 34:27.484
that you couldn't get out
of bed for more than a year,

34:27.517 --> 34:30.253
but you never said why
the relationship ended.

34:30.788 --> 34:33.223
It ended because he
became religious.

34:33.691 --> 34:34.692
You're joking.

34:35.459 --> 34:37.561
And he wanted me to be the same.

34:37.594 --> 34:38.930
And I tried, too.

34:39.529 --> 34:41.331
I tried to learn all the laws

34:41.364 --> 34:43.567
and lit the candles on Shabbat,

34:43.600 --> 34:45.402
and cooked only Kosher food...

34:46.503 --> 34:47.537
What?

34:49.539 --> 34:50.540
It's funny.

34:53.477 --> 34:54.979
Did he grow payots?

34:55.479 --> 34:56.546
Actually, he did.

34:57.014 --> 34:58.448
Was he sexy?

34:59.649 --> 35:02.720
Did he look hot?
Naked, with his payots?

35:03.654 --> 35:05.957
Better than you do,
without them.

35:07.759 --> 35:08.726
I tried.

35:09.060 --> 35:10.360
But I couldn't.

35:11.662 --> 35:12.596
I felt like a

35:12.830 --> 35:14.297
terrible person.

35:14.665 --> 35:15.867
A sinner.

35:16.533 --> 35:17.668
I didn't eat,

35:17.969 --> 35:19.302
I didn't sleep, I...

35:19.636 --> 35:22.673
I was thin like this,
maybe 40 kilos.

35:25.076 --> 35:27.879
Finally my friends had
to make an intervention

35:28.578 --> 35:30.782
and they told me I was
going crazy

35:31.414 --> 35:32.717
and I saw I was.

35:36.788 --> 35:37.789
So I left him.

35:38.956 --> 35:40.557
<i>You left him?</i>

35:41.926 --> 35:42.794
<i>I packed my
suitcase when he was at work</i>

35:42.827 --> 35:44.796
<i>and went back to
my parents' house.</i>

35:45.730 --> 35:48.065
<i>And I never saw
our white room again.</i>

35:48.900 --> 35:50.500
<i>Your white room?</i>

35:51.401 --> 35:52.837
<i>My own perfect place.</i>

35:53.570 --> 35:55.873
<i>Like the park you
never told me about.</i>

35:56.674 --> 35:57.909
<i>You see,</i>

35:58.475 --> 36:00.044
<i>I lost paradise, too.</i>

36:14.859 --> 36:16.593
<i>And now you're here.</i>

36:16.626 --> 36:17.895
<i>Now I'm here.</i>

36:18.562 --> 36:19.429
<i>But?</i>

36:20.397 --> 36:21.732
<i>I'm happy
I'm here, but...</i>

36:21.766 --> 36:23.533
<i>I hate this apartment.</i>

36:23.567 --> 36:24.501
<i>So?</i>

36:25.002 --> 36:26.369
<i>We'll move.</i>

36:26.403 --> 36:28.005
This is a great space.

36:28.438 --> 36:30.373
and it's in a great
neighborhood.

36:30.407 --> 36:31.108
Is it?

36:31.142 --> 36:32.710
The best. Where are you from?

36:33.010 --> 36:34.846
- Paris.
- Oh, Paris.

36:34.879 --> 36:37.982
- What a beautiful city.
- Have you been there?

36:38.015 --> 36:40.117
No, but I plan
on visiting someday.

36:40.151 --> 36:43.553
These windows have a rare view
for this part of town.

36:43.587 --> 36:45.455
Which I'm sure
your husband can tell you.

36:45.488 --> 36:46.991
Oh, Eden's not my husband.

36:47.024 --> 36:48.793
We're together, but not married.

36:48.826 --> 36:50.161
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

36:50.194 --> 36:51.996
You like
this neighborhood, baby?

36:52.029 --> 36:53.430
Sure.

36:53.463 --> 36:55.099
This apartment
is an absolute steal.

36:55.132 --> 36:57.902
Now, it's a little cozy
but the light is fantastic,

36:57.935 --> 36:59.402
southern exposure,

36:59.436 --> 37:01.105
which you rarely get
in a place this cheap,

37:01.138 --> 37:02.673
especially in the bedrooms.

37:02.707 --> 37:04.474
Did you see the bedrooms, baby?

37:07.544 --> 37:10.114
All the units in this building
are brand new.

37:10.513 --> 37:12.850
Central heat and air,

37:12.884 --> 37:14.451
all the appliances.

37:14.752 --> 37:15.987
It's a great size,

37:16.020 --> 37:17.922
it doesn't have
much character, but...

37:18.521 --> 37:20.858
Eden likes things simple,
right baby?

37:21.659 --> 37:22.927
Whatever.

37:25.528 --> 37:26.496
Eden?

37:27.564 --> 37:29.800
I'm sick of the way
you're acting, you hear me?

37:29.834 --> 37:30.968
How am I acting?

37:31.202 --> 37:33.137
Like you want to be
anywhere but here.

37:33.570 --> 37:35.973
I didn't like the place,
what am I supposed to do?

37:36.007 --> 37:39.643
Jump up and down and grin like a
fool until we walk out the door?

37:39.677 --> 37:40.610
You know what?

37:40.878 --> 37:42.046
You stay home,

37:42.079 --> 37:43.647
I'll do it alone.

37:43.681 --> 37:47.151
I'll talk to the realtors,
I'll make the appointments,

37:47.184 --> 37:50.520
I'll go see all the places
until I find something amazing

37:50.553 --> 37:51.488
to show you.

37:51.722 --> 37:53.024
Think that might work?

38:02.133 --> 38:03.668
Proud of yourself?

38:05.903 --> 38:07.004
You talking to me?

38:08.039 --> 38:10.507
Well, I'm the only one here,
you talking to me?

38:11.541 --> 38:12.810
But you ain't in gay <i>Paris.</i>

38:12.843 --> 38:14.544
Go grab a crepe
and your Suzette,

38:14.577 --> 38:16.747
get your ass up
'cos it's about to get gritty.

38:16.781 --> 38:19.050
I'm gonna remind you,
in case you forget,

38:19.083 --> 38:21.518
this boy came up
in New York City.

38:21.551 --> 38:23.586
Yeah boy, you're
in or house now,

38:23.620 --> 38:25.823
so watch where you beef my dog,
know what I'm sayin'?

38:25.856 --> 38:27.258
Mark Gold in the house.

38:27.291 --> 38:29.260
Ran with this bad boy
from when we were six

38:29.293 --> 38:30.627
'till we turned 13.

38:30.661 --> 38:31.963
Dropped out
of each other's lives.

38:31.996 --> 38:33.264
You know how it is,

38:33.297 --> 38:34.966
but he's in my mind
and these streets are his.

38:34.999 --> 38:37.567
Hey, yo guys
Left yo shit in the lunch room.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.170
Get off me.

38:39.203 --> 38:41.072
Adam Fink,
world's nerdiest, yet.

38:41.105 --> 38:44.607
Not saying a lot, bust a move
kid, show 'em what you've got.

38:50.314 --> 38:52.615
I thought you moved
out of town, to the country.

38:52.649 --> 38:54.151
Man, you can take
the boy out of the city,

38:54.185 --> 38:55.953
but you can't take
the city out of the boy.

38:55.987 --> 38:57.188
That's what I'm saying.

38:57.221 --> 38:58.923
That's what he's been sayin' yo.

38:58.956 --> 39:01.524
- Shorty comes in my house,
- In your house!

39:01.558 --> 39:03.861
Starts throwing her weight
around like I'm her bitch.

39:03.894 --> 39:05.663
Man, she don't know
who she's fucking with.

39:05.696 --> 39:07.264
Been taking the deed
and combing with crew

39:07.298 --> 39:09.100
since I was like 10
years old, dog.

39:09.133 --> 39:11.002
Been mugged on every
corner on the Upper West Side

39:11.035 --> 39:13.070
between Central Park West
and Riverside drive.

39:13.104 --> 39:16.173
Stole candy and comic books from
every news stand in the hood

39:16.207 --> 39:18.575
since the day I started
whacking off, son.

39:20.277 --> 39:22.179
And she gonna tell
you what to do?

39:22.213 --> 39:25.548
- Man, show her how we do, dog.
- Man, show her how we do.

39:26.616 --> 39:27.718
Let's go.

39:32.023 --> 39:33.824
Oh yeah, Mark. Okay. Slow mo'.

39:33.858 --> 39:36.160
Yeah. Get it Mark. Get it.

39:36.193 --> 39:37.228
Get it.

39:39.330 --> 39:40.630
Pass it, my turn.

39:41.198 --> 39:42.233
Go Adam.

39:44.935 --> 39:46.003
Oh!

39:50.307 --> 39:51.608
Coney Island, baby.

41:12.423 --> 41:13.623
You won't regret it.

41:17.061 --> 41:20.764
It's by far the best place in
the entire city, for the price.

41:20.798 --> 41:22.733
It's a done deal, Aviva.

41:22.766 --> 41:24.869
Signed, sealed and delivered.

41:25.936 --> 41:27.771
You sure you'll be all right?

41:28.839 --> 41:29.974
I will be.

41:30.274 --> 41:32.009
Things are just moving fast.

41:33.277 --> 41:35.779
I've been here for
nearly half a year.

41:40.451 --> 41:41.719
I'll be fine.

41:42.720 --> 41:45.222
I just need things
to slow down, for a beat.

41:45.856 --> 41:48.092
Marriage
is your only option.

41:48.459 --> 41:50.861
I mean, if you want to
stay in the country

41:50.895 --> 41:52.196
legally, of course.

41:52.863 --> 41:55.032
I thought it was only
if I have to fly

41:55.065 --> 41:57.334
out and back
until I get my green card.

41:57.968 --> 42:00.171
New immigration
laws are in place.

42:00.905 --> 42:04.975
If you want to stay here
legally, and work here legally,

42:05.009 --> 42:07.211
you need a special dispensation

42:07.244 --> 42:09.313
which takes months to file for

42:09.346 --> 42:11.715
and might take years
to go through,

42:11.749 --> 42:14.018
with no guarantee of success.

42:15.753 --> 42:17.254
I can't do that.

42:17.288 --> 42:19.924
I can only present the options
available to you.

42:21.425 --> 42:24.361
<i>Six months
ago, before I moved here,</i>

42:24.395 --> 42:26.063
<i>Eden sent me an email that said</i>

42:26.297 --> 42:28.699
<i>"My sweet Aviva
across the ocean,</i>

42:29.533 --> 42:32.236
<i>I can't believe this thing
we're having between us.</i>

42:32.903 --> 42:35.272
<i>Are you really leaving Paris
to be with me?</i>

42:36.173 --> 42:39.743
<i>I never, ever expected
something like this to happen.</i>

42:39.777 --> 42:40.911
<i>Not the way it has.</i>

42:42.413 --> 42:44.014
<i>Not with someone like you.</i>

42:46.417 --> 42:48.219
<i>I feel like a leaf in the wind,</i>

42:48.485 --> 42:50.421
<i>like my life is a strange dream.</i>

42:51.555 --> 42:53.757
<i>I'm the same actor
that I've always been,</i>

42:53.791 --> 42:54.992
<i>playing the same role,</i>

42:55.359 --> 42:56.894
<i>but there's no script anymore.</i>

42:57.294 --> 43:00.064
<i>The play doesn't
have a structure I understand.</i>

43:00.097 --> 43:02.199
<i>The way I fit into
the totality of it</i>

43:02.233 --> 43:03.934
<i>is a complete mystery to me.</i>

43:05.002 --> 43:06.203
<i>And I'm lost.</i>

43:06.570 --> 43:07.938
<i>I'm totally lost.</i>

43:11.008 --> 43:13.444
<i>I'm so grateful to you
for feeling for me.</i>

43:15.079 --> 43:17.248
<i>But I can't believe that you're
willing to anchor yourself</i>

43:17.281 --> 43:18.849
<i>to someone so lost</i>

43:18.882 --> 43:20.985
<i>and blindly wandering
through the fog.</i>

43:24.021 --> 43:26.924
<i>If there's anything that scares
me about our relationship,</i>

43:27.124 --> 43:28.926
<i>is that I'm going
to have to adjust</i>

43:28.959 --> 43:30.527
<i>to being a real person again,</i>

43:30.561 --> 43:32.329
<i>if that makes any sense at all.</i>

43:32.863 --> 43:34.398
<i>I'm trying not to allow my fear</i>

43:34.431 --> 43:37.067
<i>to fuck up the most incredible
thing in my life,</i>

43:37.534 --> 43:38.869
<i>which is you.</i>

43:39.403 --> 43:40.504
<i>You are amazing.</i>

43:41.772 --> 43:44.375
<i>You're wise and challenging and
open to adjusting and changing.</i>

43:44.608 --> 43:48.178
<i>And you never fail to step up
when the situation calls for it.</i>

43:49.046 --> 43:50.314
<i>I'm lucky to know you.</i>

43:51.148 --> 43:52.182
<i>I want you in my life.</i>

43:53.484 --> 43:56.487
<i>I'm on my knees,
begging you to be in my life.</i>

43:59.456 --> 44:00.524
<i>You are life.</i>

44:02.960 --> 44:04.495
<i>That's
what he said then.</i>

44:05.029 --> 44:07.298
- <i>Now he's saying...</i>
- I'm sorry.

44:08.165 --> 44:10.834
- It's just papers Eden.
- Yeah, it's papers,

44:10.868 --> 44:14.138
it's marriage and commitment.
It's marriage, Aviva.

44:14.171 --> 44:17.941
It's marriage so that we can see
if we want to be married.

44:18.542 --> 44:20.577
Are you saying that you
don't want to be with me?

44:20.611 --> 44:22.112
No, that's not what I'm saying.

44:22.146 --> 44:23.447
Then what are you saying?

44:24.615 --> 44:27.384
Just that I'm not ready
to get married so fast.

44:28.285 --> 44:31.322
Are you ready to come to
Paris to live with me there?

44:31.355 --> 44:32.556
You know I can't do that.

44:33.758 --> 44:36.060
You know, I didn't know
you were so fucking <i>bourgeois</i>

44:36.093 --> 44:38.195
that you make such a
big deal out of marriage.

44:38.629 --> 44:40.431
It's a legal exercise,
something that

44:40.464 --> 44:43.567
allows us to be together so
that we can explore our love!

44:44.234 --> 44:46.970
I can't believe you would allow
everything to end over

44:47.004 --> 44:49.306
some bureaucratic bullshit,
you know.

44:49.340 --> 44:50.341
Fuck it!

45:08.359 --> 45:09.960
Hey, baby.

45:12.296 --> 45:13.364
You're right.

45:13.630 --> 45:15.265
Baby.

45:17.468 --> 45:18.902
Let's do it.

45:21.105 --> 45:22.373
Stop crying.

45:23.407 --> 45:26.377
It's just papers. You're right.

45:31.281 --> 45:33.450
Thank you.
I love you so much.

45:35.619 --> 45:38.656
- I love you, too.
- Thank you.

45:40.290 --> 45:42.126
Of course.

45:49.500 --> 45:51.368
It's a beautiful night
in your city.

45:51.402 --> 45:52.236
Hmm.

45:54.037 --> 45:55.439
Want to take a walk in it?

45:55.673 --> 45:57.007
Uh-huh.

45:59.042 --> 46:00.144
Uhm...

46:00.177 --> 46:02.045
Give me a moment
to recompose myself.

46:02.079 --> 46:03.013
Of course.

46:38.081 --> 46:39.684
Dear God, thank you.

46:41.084 --> 46:43.454
Thank you for bringing
Aviva in to my life.

46:44.188 --> 46:45.690
I know I've been so cut off

46:45.723 --> 46:49.159
and how hard it's been for me to
connect to the gift of this life

46:49.193 --> 46:50.227
in the present moment...

46:50.260 --> 46:51.328
Stop.

46:54.031 --> 46:55.399
I've been cut off from myself
for so long

46:55.432 --> 46:57.167
that I've forgotten
what it's like to make

46:57.201 --> 47:00.204
choices based on a positive
connection to this life...

47:00.237 --> 47:01.104
Stop.

47:02.039 --> 47:04.408
Aviva is so strong and alive

47:04.441 --> 47:06.711
and brave... Please, stop!

47:07.812 --> 47:10.647
She's brave and she' a fighter
and I thank you for this

47:10.682 --> 47:13.183
opportunity, so that I
can move in the direction

47:13.217 --> 47:16.353
that I wouldn't have been able
to if I was on... Just stop it!

47:16.721 --> 47:19.056
Aviva is an example of courage

47:19.089 --> 47:21.358
and spirit and I thank you
for this opportunity

47:21.391 --> 47:22.727
to learn from her.

47:22.760 --> 47:24.428
Thank you for presenting me
with constant beauty

47:24.461 --> 47:26.798
when all I've done
is cast a pall of my own making

47:26.831 --> 47:29.132
over the shimmering beauty
of creation.

47:29.166 --> 47:31.468
Thank you for giving me a chance
so that I can have

47:31.502 --> 47:34.238
love and connection
and growth and joy,

47:34.271 --> 47:36.173
even when my every thought has
been turned against you

47:36.206 --> 47:38.075
in anger and ingratitude.

47:38.108 --> 47:40.611
Thank you for bringing Aviva
in to my life.

47:40.644 --> 47:44.114
Thank you for giving me a chance
to say yes rather than no.

47:44.147 --> 47:46.049
Thank you for someone
who'll actually

47:46.083 --> 47:48.151
fight for me, someone who I

47:48.185 --> 47:49.520
can fight for a yes.

47:49.553 --> 47:51.723
Thank you for someone
who will fight for me...

47:51.756 --> 47:52.790
Just stop it!

47:53.791 --> 47:55.526
Thank you for someone who will
fight me for g...

47:55.559 --> 47:57.027
Just stop it already!

47:57.427 --> 47:59.463
Fucking shit! Just stop it.

47:59.831 --> 48:03.300
For one God damn second!
Can you just sit still?

48:03.868 --> 48:06.136
Put your fucking clothes on.

48:06.470 --> 48:07.638
Please.

48:28.525 --> 48:29.626
You ready?

48:35.700 --> 48:36.734
Just go.

48:37.334 --> 48:38.569
You go.

48:58.288 --> 48:59.724
<i>Dear mom,</i>

48:59.757 --> 49:02.259
<i>we decided to have a real
New York City wedding.</i>

49:03.360 --> 49:05.362
<i>We bought rings on 47th Street,</i>

49:05.697 --> 49:08.432
<i>and then took the Metro
down to the City Hall.</i>

49:11.468 --> 49:14.538
<i>Eden's friend Mason
was our first witness,</i>

49:14.571 --> 49:17.374
<i>and Nissan flew from Berlin
to be our second,</i>

49:17.407 --> 49:20.210
<i>because it was him
who introduced us after all.</i>

49:21.211 --> 49:23.580
<i>The judge was
a strange little woman</i>

49:23.614 --> 49:25.917
- <i>who reminded me of Nana.</i>
- I, Eden.

49:25.950 --> 49:28.853
- <i>If Nana was insane.</i>
- Take Aviva to be my wife.

49:29.721 --> 49:32.189
I Eden,
take Aviva to be my wife...

49:32.222 --> 49:34.391
<i>But she
seemed really happy for us.</i>

49:34.424 --> 49:36.894
<i>She must do this
100 times a week.</i>

49:36.928 --> 49:39.363
<i>So maybe it's just my fantasy.</i>

49:39.396 --> 49:40.631
<i>But when she married us,</i>

49:40.665 --> 49:42.566
<i>I thought I saw
tears in her eyes.</i>

49:42.599 --> 49:45.903
- And I promise my love to you.
- And I promise my love to you.

49:45.937 --> 49:50.240
- With this ring, I thee wed.
- With this ring, I thee wed.

49:52.342 --> 49:53.644
I Aviva,

49:53.945 --> 49:55.913
take Eden to be my husband.

49:55.947 --> 49:57.180
I, Aviva,

49:57.214 --> 49:59.516
take Eden to be my husband.

49:59.549 --> 50:01.218
To have and to hold.

50:01.251 --> 50:02.486
To have and to hold...

50:02.519 --> 50:04.254
In sickness
and in health.

50:04.454 --> 50:06.323
In sickness and in health,

50:06.356 --> 50:08.425
For richer
and for poorer.

50:08.458 --> 50:10.360
For richer and for poorer.

50:10.394 --> 50:12.730
and I promise
my love to you.

50:12.764 --> 50:15.198
And I promise my love to you.

50:15.232 --> 50:17.601
With this ring,
I thee wed.

50:17.634 --> 50:19.269
With this ring...

50:19.302 --> 50:22.439
Just as two threads
woven in opposite directions,

50:22.472 --> 50:24.307
can form a beautify tapestry,

50:24.341 --> 50:26.610
so can your two lives
merge together

50:26.643 --> 50:28.345
to form a beautify marriage.

50:28.746 --> 50:30.782
Love is the reason you are here.

50:31.381 --> 50:33.718
But it will
take trust to...

50:45.930 --> 50:50.968
By these vows, I now
declare you husband and wife.

50:51.836 --> 50:54.706
You may kiss your bride.

50:59.777 --> 51:01.946
<i>And that
was that.</i>

51:02.747 --> 51:04.247
<i>Afterward Mason
organized a party</i>

51:04.281 --> 51:07.284
<i>for our friends
at the restaurant he owns.</i>

51:07.317 --> 51:09.987
<i>And we talked
and laughed all night.</i>

51:10.655 --> 51:12.255

54:19.810 --> 54:21.812
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

54:21.846 --> 54:23.214
Why aren't you dancing?

54:23.247 --> 54:25.149
- Are you having a good time?
- I'm trying to.

54:25.182 --> 54:27.919
Go and have fun and stop
worrying about me, okay?

54:27.952 --> 54:29.987
No, I can't when I see you
standing like this.

54:30.021 --> 54:31.621
Sure you can.

54:31.656 --> 54:32.857
You know I can't.

54:32.890 --> 54:34.524
That's your choice.

54:34.557 --> 54:36.060
If you want to make
my experience your experience

54:36.093 --> 54:37.594
that's your responsibility.

54:37.627 --> 54:39.096
I don't understand why
you're doing this right now.

54:39.130 --> 54:41.631
These are your friends,
they're here for you.

54:41.666 --> 54:42.800
They're happy for you.

54:42.833 --> 54:44.769
You're doing fine without me.

54:45.036 --> 54:47.104
In fact you're doing
a lot better without me.

54:47.138 --> 54:49.206
I'm just ruining your night.
I'm gonna go.

54:49.240 --> 54:53.010
- You're acting like a child.
- Hey. Let's not fight, okay?

54:53.044 --> 54:55.012
I'm sorry I'm ruining your time.

54:55.046 --> 54:56.613
You're better off
without me here.

54:56.646 --> 54:57.982
I'll come with you.

54:58.615 --> 54:59.984
Are you crazy?

55:00.617 --> 55:01.719
That'll be a disaster.

55:01.752 --> 55:03.254
It'll break Aviva's heart.

55:03.287 --> 55:06.223
Just stay here
and have fun, okay?

55:06.924 --> 55:09.592
No-one will notice a God damn
thing when I'm gone.

55:09.626 --> 55:10.895
The whole party
will just liven up,

55:10.928 --> 55:12.529
and no-one will even know why.

55:12.562 --> 55:15.132
Somehow everything
will just have gotten better.

55:16.901 --> 55:17.902
Hey.

55:18.568 --> 55:19.770
You know what?

55:20.271 --> 55:21.706
I'll see you later.

55:27.577 --> 55:28.980
Hey.

55:30.281 --> 55:31.782
- You okay?
- Yeah.

55:32.817 --> 55:33.918
Hey?

55:34.819 --> 55:35.987
No, it's...

55:36.954 --> 55:39.824
seeing everyone here
for me, for us.

55:40.091 --> 55:42.492
- It's...
- I know, I know.

55:43.560 --> 55:44.795
I love you.

55:45.997 --> 55:47.131
I love you.

55:47.898 --> 55:49.900
Whoo whoo!

56:23.034 --> 56:24.769
- I'm coming.
- Come.

56:25.302 --> 56:26.704
Come.

56:45.723 --> 56:46.791
My love,

56:52.997 --> 56:54.231
sorry.

56:54.265 --> 56:56.333
- No.
- So fast.

56:57.201 --> 56:58.202
You're perfect.

57:16.921 --> 57:18.756
Come here. Come here.

57:20.825 --> 57:21.792
No.

57:22.093 --> 57:23.794
- I want you to.
- Come here.

57:25.096 --> 57:27.832
- I want you to be...
- Keep doing what you doing.

57:27.865 --> 57:28.933
Are you sure?

58:04.301 --> 58:07.238
I was thinking of trying out
a song at this juncture.

58:08.005 --> 58:10.174
I know this isn't
really a musical,

58:10.708 --> 58:11.976
I love musicals.

58:12.409 --> 58:15.379
I love it when people
start to dance, but...

58:15.412 --> 58:16.380
I kinda hate it

58:16.413 --> 58:18.282
when people break out into song.

58:18.983 --> 58:20.417
I thought it'd
be fun to have the kids

58:20.451 --> 58:22.086
bust in to rap back there,

58:22.119 --> 58:24.255
even if it's way outside of
the style of everything

58:24.288 --> 58:25.923
that we're doing here, but...

58:25.956 --> 58:30.394
I mean, fuck consistency
and tone, we did it.

58:30.427 --> 58:31.896
I'm talking about when some

58:31.929 --> 58:33.931
happy guy or some
melancholy guy with his

58:33.964 --> 58:36.100
hands in his pocket suddenly
gets that faraway look

58:36.133 --> 58:37.334
in his eye,

58:37.368 --> 58:39.103
he looks somewhere
right above camera

58:39.136 --> 58:41.338
or down at his shoes and
it's like it's coming to him.

58:41.372 --> 58:44.041
This song that took
20 people months to create,

58:44.074 --> 58:46.277
he's making it up right now.

58:47.311 --> 58:48.445
He'll look up and...

58:50.314 --> 58:53.918
well like I said, I hate it,
so I'm not gonna do it.

58:55.953 --> 58:58.489
What I am gonna do is talk about
what I've been avoiding

58:58.522 --> 58:59.924
talking about.

58:59.957 --> 59:01.725
Which is Isadora.

59:05.462 --> 59:08.732
Neither Aviva or I
have been here in a while.

59:09.366 --> 59:11.101
But it's our space.

59:11.368 --> 59:12.870
And ours alone.

59:14.205 --> 59:16.040
I'm gonna talk about Isadora in
it, which is way fucked up, but

59:17.274 --> 59:20.377
life is fucked up that way.

59:20.411 --> 59:22.513
I'll meet Isadora
at a party which

59:22.546 --> 59:24.148
I'm never gonna show here.

59:25.449 --> 59:28.285
Because there are some things I
don't feel I can show correctly.

59:29.220 --> 59:31.288
It's a birthday party
for Dave Mazolla

59:31.322 --> 59:33.190
that I attend solo

59:33.224 --> 59:35.292
during the brief period when
Aviva and I are back together.

59:35.859 --> 59:38.495
Trying to work things
out after our first break up.

59:38.529 --> 59:41.265
Kind of which has come to pass
in linear time.

59:42.533 --> 59:44.201
I'm solo because
after everything

59:44.235 --> 59:46.503
we will have gone through,
Aviva is comfortable

59:46.537 --> 59:48.138
enough to generously allow me

59:48.172 --> 59:51.475
some alone time with my friends
without kicking up a fuss.

59:52.943 --> 59:55.479
That's the impression
I'm under, anyways.

59:57.348 --> 59:58.382
I'm a little drunk.

59:58.949 --> 1:00:00.451
A little more
forward than usual.

1:00:01.185 --> 1:00:05.122
And Dave introduces me to his
friend, this young woman named

1:00:05.923 --> 1:00:06.957
Isadora.

1:00:08.325 --> 1:00:09.493
It's like...

1:00:12.196 --> 1:00:15.466
electricity
is an inadequate word.

1:00:16.300 --> 1:00:19.069
When her eyes look in to mine,
it's like I can see myself

1:00:19.103 --> 1:00:20.904
reflected back at me, only...

1:00:21.272 --> 1:00:22.406
more open,

1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:24.108
more curious,

1:00:24.141 --> 1:00:26.310
more... alive,

1:00:26.343 --> 1:00:28.479
more... everything.

1:00:31.048 --> 1:00:32.116
Recognition,

1:00:35.886 --> 1:00:38.155
during this brief
chat that spans

1:00:38.856 --> 1:00:39.957
an eternity.

1:00:41.191 --> 1:00:43.427
She mentioned she's going to
Berlin to study for a semester.

1:00:43.460 --> 1:00:45.896
So I tell her to call
Nissan while she's there,

1:00:45.929 --> 1:00:48.832
making up for all the time
he's played matchmaker to me

1:00:49.133 --> 1:00:52.269
with Aviva,
so I feel proud for doing this

1:00:53.504 --> 1:00:55.939
and with Aviva so I feel sick,

1:00:55.973 --> 1:00:57.007
for doing this.

1:00:58.342 --> 1:01:00.210
Just as I expect,
Nissan falls hard for her

1:01:00.244 --> 1:01:03.213
but she blows him off
after a week, I mean,

1:01:03.447 --> 1:01:05.549
he's not for her.

1:01:06.250 --> 1:01:07.484
I'm for her.

1:01:10.087 --> 1:01:12.356
She calls or texts
me every few months

1:01:12.956 --> 1:01:14.391
lets me know that she's done
with Berlin,

1:01:14.425 --> 1:01:16.360
she's moved to Los Angeles.

1:01:16.927 --> 1:01:18.495
I always respond cordially

1:01:18.529 --> 1:01:21.832
without excess warmth because
I know if I open this door

1:01:22.399 --> 1:01:24.101
there is no turning back.

1:01:26.070 --> 1:01:28.505
None of this
has happened yet, but...

1:01:31.175 --> 1:01:32.443
it will.

1:01:33.977 --> 1:01:36.347
<i>Hey this is Zeke,
you found me.</i>

1:01:36.980 --> 1:01:38.148
<i>Express yourself.</i>

1:01:39.550 --> 1:01:41.085
<i>Hey there Zeke,</i>

1:01:41.118 --> 1:01:43.253
<i>your manager passed
me your number,</i>

1:01:43.287 --> 1:01:44.521
<i>my name is Aviva Le Grange</i>

1:01:44.955 --> 1:01:48.025
<i>I'm a video artist and
director from Paris,</i>

1:01:48.392 --> 1:01:49.960
<i>I love your music,</i>

1:01:49.993 --> 1:01:52.496
<i>especially your new song
"Love it or Leave it".</i>

1:01:52.529 --> 1:01:54.264
<i>I think it's got magic.</i>

1:01:54.998 --> 1:01:56.900
<i>I have an idea
for a video for it</i>

1:01:56.934 --> 1:01:59.203
<i>that could be something
really special.</i>

- She's brilliant.
- Yeah?

1:03:16.213 --> 1:03:18.716
Why didn't you
show me her work before?

1:03:18.750 --> 1:03:19.684
Why hide it?

1:03:20.184 --> 1:03:21.485
I wasn't hiding it,

1:03:22.319 --> 1:03:24.689
I wanted to focus this thing
on our relationship,

1:03:24.722 --> 1:03:26.590
on who we are
to each other first.

1:03:26.623 --> 1:03:28.992
Or maybe you're just
intimidated by her.

1:03:29.026 --> 1:03:29.727
I'm not.

1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:31.161
I would be.

1:03:31.528 --> 1:03:32.463
She's a genius.

1:03:33.564 --> 1:03:34.732
I'm not intimidated.

1:03:35.499 --> 1:03:36.567
I'm inspired.

I finished my first record.

1:03:57.421 --> 1:03:59.423
I'm surprised you
found the time.

1:04:00.825 --> 1:04:03.761
Listen man, I'd love for her
to do something with me, too.

1:04:03.795 --> 1:04:08.098
<i>♪ Before I'm gonna

1:04:08.131 --> 1:04:09.032
So ask her.

1:04:10.133 --> 1:04:13.604
It's just, you know, I don't
want your feelings hurt.

1:04:13.637 --> 1:04:14.471
I'm fine.

1:04:15.272 --> 1:04:16.373
Just ask her.

1:04:17.241 --> 1:04:19.409
If she wants to do it,
she'll do it.

1:04:23.113 --> 1:04:25.215
So what are you thinking?

1:04:25.249 --> 1:04:26.316
I dunno,

1:04:26.818 --> 1:04:28.185
it could be strange.

1:04:28.218 --> 1:04:29.386
Do you like
Mason's music?

1:04:29.787 --> 1:04:32.657
I do. I actually think
it's very special.

1:04:34.324 --> 1:04:35.592
Then you should do it.

1:04:54.444 --> 1:04:56.179
What do you think of this edit?

1:04:57.147 --> 1:04:58.783
It's beautiful.

1:04:58.816 --> 1:05:01.385
Yeah, but I think this
angle is better for him, no?

1:05:01.418 --> 1:05:03.086
The other one's perfect though.

1:05:03.353 --> 1:05:06.256
Captures something grounded
and spiritual at the same time.

1:05:06.290 --> 1:05:08.760
Jesus Christ,
take it easy over there.

1:05:08.793 --> 1:05:11.161
What are
you talking about?

1:05:11.194 --> 1:05:13.397
- Just it's embarrassing okay?
- What is?

1:05:13.430 --> 1:05:14.699
You know what I'm talking about.

1:05:14.732 --> 1:05:16.300
Spell it out for me.

1:05:16.333 --> 1:05:17.735
Aviva was right,

1:05:17.769 --> 1:05:19.871
it's pathetic how you are
about anything to do with Mason.

1:05:19.904 --> 1:05:22.606
He proposed the idea,
you could have said no.

1:05:22.639 --> 1:05:24.776
Right. Like I was
gonna be the bad guy.

1:05:24.809 --> 1:05:26.243
Great position to put me in.

1:05:26.276 --> 1:05:27.644
What position?

1:05:27.679 --> 1:05:29.446
Aviva doing something
nice for your friend

1:05:29.479 --> 1:05:32.449
after moving here entire life
here for you? Is that so bad?

1:05:33.250 --> 1:05:34.284
Nope.

1:05:34.318 --> 1:05:36.119
I did it, see?

1:05:36.153 --> 1:05:37.588
I'm nice. Mr. nice guy.

1:05:37.621 --> 1:05:39.590
No, you've been an asshole
ever since...

1:05:39.623 --> 1:05:40.490
Since what?

1:05:41.659 --> 1:05:44.595
You're gone even when you're
here, which is hardly ever.

1:05:44.628 --> 1:05:47.197
You're always off to the side,
angry all the time...

1:05:47.230 --> 1:05:49.299
When you do say
something, it's mean.

1:05:49.333 --> 1:05:51.301
Maybe because you've
acted like a total jealous

1:05:51.335 --> 1:05:53.403
bitch since the moment
you saw me with Mason.

1:05:53.437 --> 1:05:55.272
That's what you like to think.

1:05:55.305 --> 1:05:56.473
But you're the one
who is jealous.

1:05:56.506 --> 1:05:59.376
Me? Maybe she is.
I don't give a fuck.

1:05:59.409 --> 1:06:00.812
I'm not jealous
of either of you.

1:06:00.845 --> 1:06:03.280
You're the one telling people
where they can go,

1:06:03.313 --> 1:06:04.749
when they should be there.

1:06:04.782 --> 1:06:06.751
It's true, you've been jealous

1:06:06.784 --> 1:06:08.518
and controlling
since the day I got here.

1:06:08.552 --> 1:06:10.454
If you had any sense of
boundaries,

1:06:10.487 --> 1:06:12.289
I wouldn't need to control you.

1:06:12.322 --> 1:06:13.825
Maybe you should figure
out your own boundaries,

1:06:13.858 --> 1:06:16.460
before you worry about
how others handle theirs.

1:06:16.493 --> 1:06:18.663
You stay the fuck
out of this okay?

1:06:18.696 --> 1:06:20.263
No-one asked you to
be here in the first place.

1:06:20.297 --> 1:06:22.466
Shall I quote some of
those emails you sent me?

1:06:22.499 --> 1:06:25.369
I never wrote you
a single fucking email.

1:06:25.402 --> 1:06:26.503
No?

1:06:27.337 --> 1:06:28.505
Who do you think all those
emails

1:06:28.538 --> 1:06:29.774
you fell so in love with
were from?

1:06:29.807 --> 1:06:32.175
I was reading letters from her.

1:06:32.209 --> 1:06:33.610
You were reading
letters from me,

1:06:33.644 --> 1:06:34.912
you idiot.

1:06:35.379 --> 1:06:36.546
She barely has the patience

1:06:36.580 --> 1:06:38.248
to put a coherent
sentence together.

1:06:38.281 --> 1:06:40.852
Hey, you can go fuck
yourself too. I don't need

1:06:40.885 --> 1:06:43.655
your fucking help, if you're
going to help me like this!

1:06:43.688 --> 1:06:46.623
You know he didn't want
anything to do with you,

1:06:46.658 --> 1:06:48.726
- I don't blame him.
- So now you're on his side?

1:06:48.760 --> 1:06:51.294
- I'm not on anyone's side.
- You're taking his side.

1:06:51.328 --> 1:06:52.930
You always take his side,
I'm fucking sick of it.

1:06:52.964 --> 1:06:54.264
- Sick of it?
- Sick of it.

1:06:54.297 --> 1:06:55.632
We've never fought about it.

1:06:55.667 --> 1:06:57.267
Don't be stupid.
These fights, other fights,

1:06:57.300 --> 1:06:58.970
if there's another side
available, you'll take it.

1:06:59.003 --> 1:07:00.337
Hey calm down.

1:07:00.370 --> 1:07:01.706
Don't fucking tell me
to calm down.

1:07:01.739 --> 1:07:03.507
Chill out. Okay?

1:07:03.540 --> 1:07:06.711
I talk how I fucking
want to talk, all right?

1:07:06.744 --> 1:07:08.311
Don't tell me what to do.

1:07:08.345 --> 1:07:09.747
I don't even know who
I am anymore

1:07:09.781 --> 1:07:11.648
in this stupid fucking country.

1:07:11.683 --> 1:07:13.718
Acting like some kind of
polite American all the time.

1:07:13.751 --> 1:07:14.886
This is you polite?

1:07:15.953 --> 1:07:18.255
Jesus, I'd hate to see
you in your native habitat.

1:07:18.288 --> 1:07:19.189
Fuck you!

1:07:20.190 --> 1:07:22.827
This is who I am now,
if you don't like it...

1:07:24.494 --> 1:07:25.629
I can go home.

1:07:26.363 --> 1:07:27.732
Come one, don't say that.

1:07:28.265 --> 1:07:29.566
Do you even want me here?

1:07:29.599 --> 1:07:30.935
Of course I want you here.

1:07:31.368 --> 1:07:32.670
I'm not talking to you,

1:07:33.303 --> 1:07:34.371
talking to him.

1:07:36.874 --> 1:07:38.341
Do you even want me here?

1:07:41.478 --> 1:07:43.647
Don't put your choices on me.

1:07:47.819 --> 1:07:49.854
You're gonna
fuck this up.

1:07:50.755 --> 1:07:52.824
You're gonna fuck everything up,

1:07:52.857 --> 1:07:53.991
you always do.

1:07:54.025 --> 1:07:55.827
Maybe if you didn't
keep getting me

1:07:55.860 --> 1:07:57.662
into shit that
I don't want to be in,

1:07:57.695 --> 1:07:59.964
I wouldn't have to
fuck anything up.

1:08:00.798 --> 1:08:01.699
I see.

1:08:02.299 --> 1:08:03.835
You don't want to be in this?

1:08:06.070 --> 1:08:07.071
Come on, man.

1:08:08.472 --> 1:08:10.640
Don't say things you
won't be able to take back.

1:08:12.476 --> 1:08:15.512
Aviva's here, I'm here.

1:08:16.413 --> 1:08:19.349
You're the one who needs
to decide what he wants to do.

1:08:20.985 --> 1:08:24.554
This is the best thing that's
ever happened to me in my life.

1:08:25.455 --> 1:08:27.357
You wanna take it away from me,

1:08:28.492 --> 1:08:29.459
go ahead.

1:08:30.695 --> 1:08:31.829
I can't stop you,

1:08:31.863 --> 1:08:33.396
I never could.

1:08:37.467 --> 1:08:38.970
I'm doing
something wrong.

1:08:39.003 --> 1:08:40.437
You're not doing anything wrong.

1:08:40.470 --> 1:08:41.739
Yes, I am.

1:08:47.577 --> 1:08:48.713
You brought us all together,

1:08:49.346 --> 1:08:51.314
you're not doing anything wrong.

1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:05.663
I know I said earlier
that there's nothing more lonely

1:09:05.696 --> 1:09:07.999
or more depressing than
being alone in New York City,

1:09:08.032 --> 1:09:11.434
but that's not
empirically speaking, correct.

1:09:11.969 --> 1:09:13.637
There's nothing more lonely

1:09:13.671 --> 1:09:15.740
than being alone in Los Angeles.

1:09:15.773 --> 1:09:18.308
- It's left, turn left.
- I got it.

1:09:25.482 --> 1:09:27.617
- "Dear Aviva."
- "Dear?"

1:09:27.651 --> 1:09:29.519
Are you seriously
letting go of sweet?

1:09:29.553 --> 1:09:32.723
Is that really what you want
me to be focusing on right now?

1:09:35.059 --> 1:09:36.493
I'll just write sweet.

1:09:37.662 --> 1:09:39.496
"Dear <i>Aviva,</i>

1:09:40.530 --> 1:09:42.900
I heard you were in
the desert somewhere.

1:09:48.172 --> 1:09:49.807
<i>I remember I promised myself</i>

1:09:50.107 --> 1:09:52.576
<i>or you, that I would write
to you at least something</i>

1:09:52.609 --> 1:09:55.512
<i>once a day for all the time
we would know each other.</i>

1:09:57.715 --> 1:10:01.052
<i>I guess it took us breaking
up for me to honor it again.</i>

1:10:02.053 --> 1:10:03.688
<i>You're an amazing person.</i>

1:10:04.121 --> 1:10:05.790
<i>You always surprised me,</i>

1:10:06.423 --> 1:10:08.860
<i>even though I'm so jaded
and often unengaged,</i>

1:10:09.827 --> 1:10:12.163
<i>you told me I don't
know how to live,</i>

1:10:12.196 --> 1:10:13.097
<i>it's true.</i>

1:10:14.332 --> 1:10:16.801
<i>I don't know how to make
the most out of a simple day.</i>

1:10:17.467 --> 1:10:19.837
<i>I don't know how to get
the most out of breakfast,</i>

1:10:19.871 --> 1:10:21.504
<i>to enjoy a simple walk.</i>

1:10:21.538 --> 1:10:23.074
<i>To get the most out
of work or creativity</i>

1:10:23.107 --> 1:10:25.508
<i>in anything other
than sporadic bursts.</i>

1:10:34.051 --> 1:10:36.053
<i>I don't know how to move
through time and space</i>

1:10:36.087 --> 1:10:39.456
<i>with a sense of accepting that
I'm the vessel doing the moving.</i>

1:10:39.757 --> 1:10:41.826
<i>Even as I understand
I'm doing myself</i>

1:10:41.859 --> 1:10:43.928
<i>and God and injustice
by directing</i>

1:10:43.961 --> 1:10:47.098
<i>such negativity toward a life
that I should be grateful for.</i>

1:10:54.105 --> 1:10:56.674
<i>I imagine it's very confusing
being in a relationship</i>

1:10:56.707 --> 1:10:57.975
<i>with someone like me.</i>

1:10:58.175 --> 1:11:00.711
<i>I get angry sometimes
when I see how real</i>

1:11:01.045 --> 1:11:03.147
<i>you are, how substantial.</i>

1:11:03.714 --> 1:11:05.883
<i>And I'm in this stupid,
ugly place</i>

1:11:05.917 --> 1:11:07.550
<i>floating around like a ghost.</i>

1:11:11.055 --> 1:11:13.658
<i>But then I realize that
I'd rather be this way</i>

1:11:13.691 --> 1:11:15.927
<i>or I wouldn't be here
doing what I'm doing.</i>

1:11:16.559 --> 1:11:18.561
<i>Making one reality
after another and then</i>

1:11:18.595 --> 1:11:21.666
<i>abandoning it, so that others
can inhabit it without me.</i>

1:11:29.273 --> 1:11:30.507
<i>I'm running,</i>

1:11:31.776 --> 1:11:34.679
<i>I don't ever wanna get caught
but I am tired of running.</i>

1:11:38.282 --> 1:11:40.084
<i>Sorry I've been going
on and on here,</i>

1:11:40.117 --> 1:11:42.619
<i>but you wanted to know
where I'm at.</i>

1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:44.088
<i>So here you have it.</i>

1:11:44.956 --> 1:11:46.223
<i>I admire you</i>

1:11:47.191 --> 1:11:48.491
<i>and I love you.</i>

1:11:49.126 --> 1:11:50.493
<i>E."</i>

1:11:50.828 --> 1:11:51.829
<i>"Dear E,</i>

1:11:52.930 --> 1:11:54.999
<i>it's both painful and moving
to read your words."</i>

1:11:56.901 --> 1:11:58.836
- Don't do that.
- What?

1:11:58.869 --> 1:12:02.907
That stupid bopping to the music
in the car, sort of thing.

1:12:03.741 --> 1:12:06.243
It's cutesy and ingratiating
and I fucking hate it.

1:12:06.277 --> 1:12:08.879
If you wanna dance,
pull over, stop the car,

1:12:08.913 --> 1:12:11.015
get out and make
a proper fucking dance.

1:12:11.048 --> 1:12:13.684
- Who's cut off and mean now?
- I am.

1:12:14.118 --> 1:12:15.186
Deal with it.

1:12:19.890 --> 1:12:21.624
You wanna hear the rest of it?

1:12:24.161 --> 1:12:25.262
Sure.

1:12:27.298 --> 1:12:30.600
"It was so strange for me
to be alone in the city,

1:12:31.902 --> 1:12:35.039
hard to go meet people for work
and put myself out there.

1:12:36.606 --> 1:12:39.110
So confusing meeting men,
and the world in general,

1:12:39.677 --> 1:12:41.812
with the knowledge
that we're separated.

1:12:42.579 --> 1:12:45.615
So I got myself out of there
and headed in to the desert,

1:12:45.983 --> 1:12:47.184
in New Mexico.

1:12:48.052 --> 1:12:50.021
Spent a lot of time
there by myself,

1:12:51.856 --> 1:12:53.523
one day I got kinda lost.

1:12:53.958 --> 1:12:55.126
It was scary,

1:12:55.659 --> 1:12:56.894
a story for another day.

1:12:58.029 --> 1:13:00.530
Then I met these two people
who really saved my ass.

1:13:01.766 --> 1:13:04.668
They were this couple who travel
to the most dangerous places

1:13:04.702 --> 1:13:05.635
in the world

1:13:06.037 --> 1:13:07.772
and they dance together there.

1:13:08.873 --> 1:13:10.307
And they're not the only ones,

1:13:10.741 --> 1:13:12.009
it's a thing.

1:13:13.744 --> 1:13:16.047
Gave me an idea to make
a movie out of it.

1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:19.350
Started filming them and
I'm putting together a teaser

1:13:19.383 --> 1:13:20.885
to raise money
for the rest of it.

1:13:20.918 --> 1:13:23.187
I'm DJ'ing for Zeke's club shows

1:13:23.220 --> 1:13:25.322
and she's gonna do
the music for it.

1:13:25.356 --> 1:13:26.724
It's a trip.

1:13:28.993 --> 1:13:30.961
I'm lonelier than
I've ever been,

1:13:31.328 --> 1:13:34.065
sadder and happier
than I've ever been all at once.

1:13:35.632 --> 1:13:36.834
I love you

1:13:37.368 --> 1:13:38.469
and I have no regrets,

1:13:39.837 --> 1:13:42.907
but I don't wanna go through
something like this again.

1:13:43.841 --> 1:13:46.677
I wanna be with somebody
who wants to be with me.

1:13:47.778 --> 1:13:48.846
The way I am,

1:13:50.014 --> 1:13:51.782
not the way he wants me to be.

1:13:53.650 --> 1:13:55.820
I have so much love and passion
in me

1:13:55.853 --> 1:13:58.022
and I don't want to feel
guilty about it.

1:13:59.790 --> 1:14:02.359
Still, I miss us and I miss you.

1:14:04.128 --> 1:14:05.162
A."

1:14:06.831 --> 1:14:08.065
Nicole just texted you.

1:14:08.899 --> 1:14:11.268
- Nicole?
- Yeah, from high school.

1:14:11.302 --> 1:14:12.703
I know who she is.

1:14:13.938 --> 1:14:15.840
Just surprised
to hear from here.

1:14:15.873 --> 1:14:16.907
Well, she's here.

1:14:17.308 --> 1:14:18.275
You mean in LA?

1:14:19.276 --> 1:14:21.378
No, I mean in this car,
stashed in the trunk.

1:14:23.414 --> 1:14:24.748
I always liked her.

1:14:25.883 --> 1:14:28.152
I have nothing
to talk with her about.

1:14:28.185 --> 1:14:30.121
- I do.
- We have no shared interests.

1:14:30.154 --> 1:14:31.355
Nothing in common,

1:14:31.856 --> 1:14:32.590
nothing.

1:14:33.057 --> 1:14:35.392
Daredevil,
that's my guy.

1:14:35.426 --> 1:14:38.963
Smart and blind,
just how I like my men.

1:14:39.396 --> 1:14:42.900
I don't know,
I was strictly Kirby style.

1:14:42.933 --> 1:14:46.003
Cosmic stuff,
worlds beyond imagination,

1:14:46.036 --> 1:14:48.139
shit that actually
opens your mind.

1:14:49.006 --> 1:14:53.010
Thor, F.F.,
The Eternals, The New Gods.

1:14:53.043 --> 1:14:56.680
It was all street level for me.
Someone I could identify with.

1:14:56.981 --> 1:14:59.917
Like, if I looked into an alley

1:14:59.950 --> 1:15:01.252
on the way to school,

1:15:01.285 --> 1:15:03.354
I might just catch a glimpse
in the shadows.

1:15:03.387 --> 1:15:05.990
Punisher, Daredevil, Spiderman,

1:15:06.023 --> 1:15:07.958
Spiderman is street level?

1:15:07.992 --> 1:15:09.827
Compared to the New Gods, he is.

1:15:09.860 --> 1:15:12.363
Look,
I liked those guys growing up,

1:15:12.396 --> 1:15:14.999
it was fine if I couldn't get
my hands on anything else

1:15:15.032 --> 1:15:18.369
but where is the imagination,
the aspiration?

1:15:18.402 --> 1:15:21.071
Sometimes putting your fist
through some jerk's face,

1:15:21.105 --> 1:15:22.973
is all the aspiration you need.

1:15:24.842 --> 1:15:25.876
Good to know.

1:15:26.143 --> 1:15:28.345
Can I refresh
anybody's drink?

1:15:29.446 --> 1:15:30.915
We've already had thee.

1:15:31.282 --> 1:15:34.051
One more and I'll be
at maximum suggestibility.

1:15:34.351 --> 1:15:35.819
She'll have another one.

1:15:36.220 --> 1:15:37.321
What about you?

1:15:37.821 --> 1:15:39.690
I still have work to do tonight.

1:15:40.758 --> 1:15:41.959
Really?

1:15:45.996 --> 1:15:47.998
- You okay?
- I'm great.

1:15:48.299 --> 1:15:50.134
But how can I make you,
you know?

1:15:50.167 --> 1:15:52.403
You don't have to do anything,
I'm great.

1:15:54.004 --> 1:15:57.074
- I want you to be happy.
- I'm happy.

1:15:57.107 --> 1:15:59.310
I mean, really happy.

1:15:59.343 --> 1:16:01.946
- I'm really happy.
- Jesus.

1:16:05.482 --> 1:16:06.984
Come on, move over.

1:16:08.519 --> 1:16:09.954
Where are you going?

1:16:36.914 --> 1:16:38.182
Do it hard.

1:16:41.452 --> 1:16:42.953
You can do it harder.

1:16:43.287 --> 1:16:44.521
She said do it harder.

1:16:47.424 --> 1:16:49.860
Yes. Yes.

1:16:49.893 --> 1:16:51.528
Oh yes. Yes.

1:17:01.605 --> 1:17:02.940
Oh, my gosh.

1:17:04.108 --> 1:17:05.209
Unbelievable.

1:17:09.313 --> 1:17:12.449
I'm gonna go make some coffee,
you guys want anything?

1:17:12.483 --> 1:17:14.485
No, thank you.

1:17:14.518 --> 1:17:15.486
I'm good.

1:17:16.020 --> 1:17:17.221

- Hey?
- <i>Hey.</i>

1:19:40.097 --> 1:19:42.667
- <i>How are you?</i>
- Good, I'm good.

1:19:43.634 --> 1:19:44.669
Are you?

1:19:45.202 --> 1:19:46.603
Yeah.

1:19:47.037 --> 1:19:48.939
Better than I've
been in a while.

1:19:50.174 --> 1:19:51.709
<i>How are the shows going?</i>

1:19:52.376 --> 1:19:54.044
Uh, they're going.

1:19:55.279 --> 1:19:57.481
I'm signing with Dream Shot.

1:19:59.316 --> 1:20:00.752
<i>That's a great agency.</i>

1:20:00.785 --> 1:20:03.053
Yeah, they just got me
the rest of the budget

1:20:03.086 --> 1:20:04.388
to make my feature.

1:20:06.256 --> 1:20:07.659
- Jesus.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1:20:09.059 --> 1:20:09.960
That's amazing.

1:20:11.796 --> 1:20:14.364
Everyone I know
is talking about your work.

1:20:17.134 --> 1:20:19.970
You know, I'm here in town.

1:20:20.805 --> 1:20:22.072
<i>Here?</i>

1:20:23.106 --> 1:20:24.742
<i>Yeah,
it was a last minute thing.</i>

1:20:25.810 --> 1:20:27.644
I was going to tell you but...

1:20:28.612 --> 1:20:30.280
<i>I wasn't sure I should call.</i>

1:20:30.547 --> 1:20:31.683
Why wouldn't you call?

1:20:33.650 --> 1:20:35.385
<i>I don't know.</i>

1:20:36.220 --> 1:20:38.522
<i>I'm editing this thing
after screening it here,</i>

1:20:38.555 --> 1:20:39.724
<i>in a few days.</i>

1:20:39.757 --> 1:20:41.659
I was hoping you could
check it out,

1:20:41.693 --> 1:20:43.494
maybe do a few things to it.

1:20:44.495 --> 1:20:46.096
- but...
- <i>I'll be there.</i>

1:20:46.129 --> 1:20:47.665
If it's not
a good time for you...

1:20:47.699 --> 1:20:49.500
<i>No, I'll be there,
I'll be there.</i>

1:21:18.128 --> 1:21:19.463
This is not a work place.

1:21:20.130 --> 1:21:21.431
It's our space.

1:21:21.866 --> 1:21:23.100
It was.

1:21:27.772 --> 1:21:29.039
I miss you.

1:21:30.374 --> 1:21:31.642
I missed you too.

1:21:33.577 --> 1:21:35.212
We should get back together.

1:21:39.751 --> 1:21:40.785
What?

1:21:41.485 --> 1:21:42.720
Your timing is just...

1:21:43.955 --> 1:21:47.491
After so many sleepless nights,
so many broken hearted days,

1:21:47.524 --> 1:21:50.193
finally I get myself to a place
when I can...

1:21:51.595 --> 1:21:52.664
And now...

1:21:56.567 --> 1:21:58.268
I'm sorry, I...

1:22:00.404 --> 1:22:01.505
I'm sorry.

1:22:06.878 --> 1:22:08.612
It's exactly what we needed,

1:22:10.147 --> 1:22:12.349
to get to a better
place that we couldn't

1:22:12.382 --> 1:22:14.351
get to when
we were still together,

1:22:14.384 --> 1:22:15.687
because of all the pressure

1:22:15.720 --> 1:22:18.121
of long distance,
of constantly being rushed,

1:22:18.155 --> 1:22:19.724
we can restart this
the right way now.

1:22:19.757 --> 1:22:22.092
I don't think
this is the right time.

1:22:22.894 --> 1:22:25.863
Please. Please come back.

1:22:27.531 --> 1:22:28.599
I love you.

1:22:30.167 --> 1:22:31.602
I don't wanna let you go.

1:22:33.236 --> 1:22:34.304
Please come back.

1:22:35.539 --> 1:22:36.607
Please come back.

1:22:41.746 --> 1:22:42.847
I love you, too.

1:22:44.214 --> 1:22:45.449
I'm here.

1:22:46.784 --> 1:22:50.320
Let's do what we
came here to do. Okay.

1:22:55.960 --> 1:22:57.829
Is it just the three of us?

1:22:58.462 --> 1:22:59.630
She'll be back soon.

1:23:04.836 --> 1:23:05.870
Hey, come on.

1:23:06.804 --> 1:23:08.840
You do what you have
to do, I'm...

1:23:08.873 --> 1:23:11.575
gonna sit here and wait for her
for a minute, okay?

1:26:38.049 --> 1:26:39.616
<i>He waited.</i>

1:26:40.450 --> 1:26:42.552
<i>He had done what I
had asked him to do.</i>

1:26:42.854 --> 1:26:44.121
<i>I have to give him that.</i>

1:26:46.057 --> 1:26:46.991
<i>And he waited.</i>

1:26:48.025 --> 1:26:50.393
<i>He waited for a lot
more than a minute.</i>

1:26:51.128 --> 1:26:53.563
<i>There was no reason
to be in Los Angeles anymore</i>

1:26:53.597 --> 1:26:55.733
<i>so it was back to
the New York apartment,</i>

1:26:55.766 --> 1:26:57.034
<i>our old white room.</i>

1:26:57.668 --> 1:26:59.369
<i>Only it wasn't so white anymore,</i>

1:26:59.670 --> 1:27:01.538
<i>Aviva had decorated
the hell out of it</i>

1:27:01.571 --> 1:27:03.040
<i>in the time we were apart.</i>

1:27:03.074 --> 1:27:04.641
<i>New furniture everywhere,</i>

1:27:04.675 --> 1:27:07.544
<i>posters, and even
paintings on the walls.</i>

1:27:07.577 --> 1:27:09.881
<i>Bizarre chachkas on every shelf,</i>

1:27:10.214 --> 1:27:12.116
<i>I hardly recognized it anymore.</i>

1:27:18.555 --> 1:27:19.657
<i>But I was happy.</i>

1:27:20.191 --> 1:27:22.860
<i>I mean, really happy.</i>

1:27:23.493 --> 1:27:25.730
<i>Maybe for the first
time in my life.</i>

1:27:30.801 --> 1:27:31.903
<i>And he waited.</i>

1:27:33.070 --> 1:27:35.072
<i>But she had found something
he had never given her.</i>

1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:38.175
<i>Something that
in her heart of hearts</i>

1:27:38.209 --> 1:27:41.511
<i>she didn't believe he ever
would, or could give her.</i>

1:27:44.581 --> 1:27:46.017
<i>And once having found it,</i>

1:27:46.650 --> 1:27:48.686
<i>she was not about to
easily let it go.</i>

1:27:49.253 --> 1:27:51.621
<i>No matter how good
everything else was.</i>

1:27:52.189 --> 1:27:53.490
<i>And it was good,</i>

1:27:55.059 --> 1:27:56.694
<i>as good as good can be.</i>

1:28:09.807 --> 1:28:11.742
<i>And maybe she
would've come back,</i>

1:28:11.776 --> 1:28:12.877
<i>eventually,</i>

1:28:15.880 --> 1:28:17.480
<i>maybe she did come back.</i>

1:28:24.255 --> 1:28:25.690
<i>I don't really know,</i>

1:28:28.059 --> 1:28:29.193
<i>because by then...</i>

1:28:36.901 --> 1:28:38.169
<i>there was no-one home.</i>

1:28:44.942 --> 1:28:46.476
You can do it harder.

1:28:51.015 --> 1:28:52.582
You can do it much harder.

1:28:52.615 --> 1:28:53.784
How much harder?

1:28:53.818 --> 1:28:55.086
As hard as you want to.

1:28:55.652 --> 1:28:56.854
We need a safe word.

1:28:57.221 --> 1:28:58.856
I don't need a safe word.

1:28:59.056 --> 1:29:00.825
Maybe I need a safe word.

1:29:00.858 --> 1:29:03.493
We don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

1:29:03.861 --> 1:29:05.162
Do you want me to do it?

1:29:05.196 --> 1:29:07.264
I want you to want to do it.

1:29:23.314 --> 1:29:24.581
Ow.

1:29:25.850 --> 1:29:26.851
Come on.

1:29:57.982 --> 1:29:59.016
Did you...

1:29:59.683 --> 1:30:00.751
It was great.

1:30:02.186 --> 1:30:03.854
Yeah, but you didn't...

1:30:04.889 --> 1:30:06.223
There's always next time.

1:30:12.029 --> 1:30:14.597
- Hey.
- Hey. Give me two seconds, okay?

1:30:15.299 --> 1:30:17.301
Hey, can I
talk to you for a minute?

1:30:17.334 --> 1:30:18.869
It can't wait, okay.

1:30:18.903 --> 1:30:20.738
One camera please.

1:30:22.239 --> 1:30:23.841
I just need a minute, okay?

1:30:37.888 --> 1:30:39.323
I can't do this by myself.

1:30:39.890 --> 1:30:41.092
No-one said you had to.

1:30:41.325 --> 1:30:43.360
I don't wanna have to
rely on you anymore.

1:30:43.394 --> 1:30:45.595
I have to be able to
do this on my own.

1:30:45.896 --> 1:30:49.233
Do you have any idea how fucked
up and wrong you are? Do you?

1:30:49.266 --> 1:30:50.868
You don't know how it feels.

1:30:50.901 --> 1:30:53.904
To have never been able to
make one woman for one single

1:30:53.938 --> 1:30:55.206
moment in your life.

1:30:55.239 --> 1:30:57.775
- They like your jokes.
- Fuck you.

1:30:58.943 --> 1:31:02.012
They're only pretending to laugh
to kill time, until you show up.

1:31:02.913 --> 1:31:05.149
I've never even given
a woman an orgasm.

1:31:05.182 --> 1:31:06.984
Not one single orgasm.

1:31:07.017 --> 1:31:08.319
Not one, ever.

1:31:09.854 --> 1:31:10.988
I'm over this.

1:31:11.922 --> 1:31:13.090
Over your fear,

1:31:13.124 --> 1:31:14.358
over your anger.

1:31:15.059 --> 1:31:16.861
Go find someone who doesn't know
any better

1:31:16.894 --> 1:31:17.962
and take the credit for it.

1:31:17.995 --> 1:31:19.697
I can't and I don't want to.

1:31:19.730 --> 1:31:22.933
I wanna be with someone who
I want, for once in my life.

1:31:22.967 --> 1:31:26.904
Not who you want, who I want
and who wants me. Not you, me.

1:31:26.937 --> 1:31:28.839
How the fuck is anyone
supposed to want you,

1:31:28.873 --> 1:31:30.207
when you hate you
so God damn much?

1:31:30.241 --> 1:31:31.809
I don't hate me.

1:31:32.042 --> 1:31:35.246
I hate you. I've always
hated you, ever since...

1:31:37.915 --> 1:31:40.317
Every single problem,
every issue I was having

1:31:40.351 --> 1:31:42.920
with Aviva, was a problem
I was having with you.

1:31:43.454 --> 1:31:45.923
I don't have
a problem with Aviva.

1:31:47.057 --> 1:31:48.392
It's you.

1:31:49.627 --> 1:31:52.696
So are you gonna get back on
your little bike and ride away?

1:31:52.730 --> 1:31:55.232
Or are you gonna do
something about it?

1:31:56.901 --> 1:31:57.968
Socks.

1:31:58.002 --> 1:31:59.303
Thermal stuff is good.

1:31:59.336 --> 1:32:00.771
I have thermal stuff.

1:32:00.804 --> 1:32:02.106
I know how to pack.

1:32:03.240 --> 1:32:04.441
Did you order a taxi?

1:32:04.475 --> 1:32:07.378
I thought you...
I'll order, I got it.

1:32:09.046 --> 1:32:10.114
Give me that.

1:32:12.917 --> 1:32:14.151
Make sure you're with someone

1:32:14.185 --> 1:32:15.819
who really
knows what they're doing.

1:32:15.853 --> 1:32:16.754
I'll be fine.

1:32:18.422 --> 1:32:19.757
Right.

1:32:20.457 --> 1:32:22.393
You're about to go
follow some lunatics

1:32:22.426 --> 1:32:24.395
up the side of
a mountain in Alaska.

1:32:25.062 --> 1:32:27.331
Look, I'm making
a movie about couples

1:32:27.364 --> 1:32:29.300
who inspire each other
to go to the edge.

1:32:30.367 --> 1:32:32.736
Doesn't mean you have to
go there with them.

1:32:33.070 --> 1:32:35.139
People are opening up
their lives to me.

1:32:35.172 --> 1:32:37.408
If they're going there,
I've gotta go there too.

1:32:40.411 --> 1:32:42.980
You gonna back me up here
or you just gonna sit there

1:32:43.013 --> 1:32:44.281
staring at the door?

1:32:44.782 --> 1:32:46.951
I'm not
staring at the door.

1:32:46.984 --> 1:32:48.319
I'm making flight plans.

1:32:58.229 --> 1:32:59.363
Flight plans?

1:33:00.364 --> 1:33:02.166
I'm going to LA for a week.

1:33:03.901 --> 1:33:05.135
This is news.

1:33:05.169 --> 1:33:06.403
It's a last minute meeting.

1:33:09.073 --> 1:33:11.242
Oh, before I go to Alaska?

1:33:12.943 --> 1:33:14.078
Next morning.

1:33:51.215 --> 1:33:52.883
Door closes.

1:33:52.916 --> 1:33:55.152
Down three flights.
Picks up bag.

1:33:55.185 --> 1:33:57.354
Goes outside. Looks for a taxi.

1:33:57.388 --> 1:34:00.858
Taxi. Taxi. Taxi. Whoo.

1:34:00.891 --> 1:34:04.194
Picks up bag.
"The airport please."

1:34:06.230 --> 1:34:07.264
It's hot.

1:34:09.633 --> 1:34:11.602
Ooh.

1:34:11.635 --> 1:34:15.406
Gets money out. Pays. Kicks
the door open. Gets the bag.

1:34:16.340 --> 1:34:17.441
Passport.

1:34:23.147 --> 1:34:25.316
Security. Computer.

1:34:25.649 --> 1:34:27.418
Beep. Shoes.

1:34:28.218 --> 1:34:29.586
Beep, beep, beep.

1:34:30.621 --> 1:34:31.855
Shoes.

1:34:31.889 --> 1:34:32.890
Computer.

1:34:32.923 --> 1:34:35.125
Bag. On the plane.

1:34:35.626 --> 1:34:36.927
Looks for the seat.

1:34:37.361 --> 1:34:38.362
32B.

1:34:45.402 --> 1:34:47.538
Seat belt. Looks out the window.

1:34:49.106 --> 1:34:50.407
Time for takeoff.

1:34:58.415 --> 1:35:02.386
Cruising altitude is
30 thousand hundred feet.

1:35:03.654 --> 1:35:04.988
Drink please.

1:35:05.022 --> 1:35:06.156
Click.

1:35:26.678 --> 1:35:27.945
Another drink.

1:35:31.982 --> 1:35:33.250
Time for landing.

1:35:37.388 --> 1:35:41.525
"Welcome to LA where the weather
is perfect all the time."

1:35:50.100 --> 1:35:51.435
Catches the car keys.

1:35:52.403 --> 1:35:53.437
Good day.

1:36:00.144 --> 1:36:02.680
Picks up the phone. Ding. Ding.

1:36:08.385 --> 1:36:09.420
"Hey."

1:36:11.355 --> 1:36:13.691
"Isadora. It's Eden."

1:36:15.092 --> 1:36:17.528
"Wow, what a surprise."

1:36:18.362 --> 1:36:22.399
"Yeah. Even more of a surprise,
I'm in LA."

1:36:23.200 --> 1:36:24.301
"Really?"

1:36:24.769 --> 1:36:26.136
"Yeah."

1:36:26.403 --> 1:36:27.337
"Wow."

1:36:27.371 --> 1:36:29.640
"Uh, any chance you're around?"

1:36:29.674 --> 1:36:30.974
"I'm around."

1:36:31.308 --> 1:36:33.544
"Well, uh, can I see you?"

1:36:33.577 --> 1:36:35.379
"You can see me."

1:36:35.680 --> 1:36:36.547
"When?"

1:36:37.047 --> 1:36:39.016
"How about... now?"

1:36:39.416 --> 1:36:41.318
"Okay, where's your address?"

1:36:41.351 --> 1:36:43.654
"I'll text you it.
It's a five story walk-up.

1:36:43.688 --> 1:36:45.222
Think you can make it up?"

1:36:45.522 --> 1:36:47.157
"I can make it up."

1:36:48.091 --> 1:36:49.661
What is this feeling?

1:36:50.260 --> 1:36:52.229
This feeling that he's
never had before

1:36:52.664 --> 1:36:56.433
This feeling, this,
even before it happens,

1:36:56.467 --> 1:36:59.269
he knows that there's
no going back.

1:36:59.303 --> 1:37:02.539
Either this is gonna
be complete bullshit

1:37:02.573 --> 1:37:05.642
or this is it.

1:37:13.083 --> 1:37:14.284
Ping.

1:37:49.821 --> 1:37:51.388
Found the edge, huh?

1:37:55.727 --> 1:37:57.294
I guess I went over it.

1:37:58.562 --> 1:38:00.030
I guess so.

1:38:02.466 --> 1:38:05.536
I hope I didn't fuck up
your business trip too much.

1:38:05.569 --> 1:38:06.637
Don't be stupid.

1:38:10.574 --> 1:38:11.709
What's the damage?

1:38:15.612 --> 1:38:17.047
I fractured

1:38:17.682 --> 1:38:20.083
three vertebras in my spine.

1:38:23.287 --> 1:38:24.789
The doctor said that...

1:38:25.790 --> 1:38:28.091
I might be all right,
eventually.

1:38:30.561 --> 1:38:34.097
But it's going to take
a lot of time and patience.

1:38:46.811 --> 1:38:48.178
Can we go home now?

1:38:54.819 --> 1:38:56.821
<i>"What
unbelievable timing,"</i>

1:38:56.854 --> 1:38:58.322
<i>he thinks to himself.</i>

1:38:58.355 --> 1:38:59.489
<i>A joke.</i>

1:38:59.523 --> 1:39:01.458
<i>A test too monstrous
even for a cruel</i>

1:39:01.491 --> 1:39:03.160
<i>and capricious God to invent.</i>

1:39:03.695 --> 1:39:06.430
<i>Leaving Aviva now
would be unforgivable.</i>

1:39:07.464 --> 1:39:09.834
<i>He's gonna be like a character
in a Russian novel.</i>

1:39:10.601 --> 1:39:13.370
<i>It
was said in his later days,</i>

1:39:13.805 --> 1:39:14.772
<i>he could be seen</i>

1:39:15.740 --> 1:39:20.110
<i>walking arm in arm
with his frail wife</i>

1:39:20.510 --> 1:39:21.645
<i>in the park</i>

1:39:22.479 --> 1:39:23.547
<i>of a Sunday,</i>

1:39:24.782 --> 1:39:26.149
<i>taking in the air.</i>

1:39:26.918 --> 1:39:29.887
<i>A faraway look in
his hollow eyes.</i>

1:39:31.421 --> 1:39:33.223
<i>Like two ghosts.</i>

1:39:33.791 --> 1:39:35.392
Without purpose

1:39:35.793 --> 1:39:37.427
or destination.

1:39:39.396 --> 1:39:42.299
They've wondered
through the land of the living...

1:39:42.332 --> 1:39:43.433
Please!

1:40:18.002 --> 1:40:20.437
I can't do this anymore.

1:40:26.576 --> 1:40:27.611
I know.

1:40:31.816 --> 1:40:33.383
Did you meet someone?

1:40:36.520 --> 1:40:37.621
Yes.

1:40:41.358 --> 1:40:42.459
In Los Angeles?

1:40:46.530 --> 1:40:47.631
Yes.

1:40:57.441 --> 1:40:59.409
Will you stay with
me long enough

1:40:59.977 --> 1:41:03.480
to help me go through some
of the doctor's appointments?

1:41:05.883 --> 1:41:07.885
So I can figure out what's what?

1:41:10.922 --> 1:41:14.424
He stays for
six weeks before he takes off.

1:41:15.559 --> 1:41:17.461
As for his thing with Isadora,

1:41:18.462 --> 1:41:19.396
pfft.

1:41:19.697 --> 1:41:20.865
I end it in five.

1:41:23.567 --> 1:41:24.836
Payback's a bitch!

1:41:26.771 --> 1:41:28.673
He'll never forgive me for it.

1:41:29.473 --> 1:41:30.808
Fuck him!

1:41:30.842 --> 1:41:32.542
What's he ever
really done for me?

1:41:32.944 --> 1:41:35.312
Other than a few brief misfires.

1:41:35.847 --> 1:41:37.682
He and I are
in a relationship now.

1:41:37.715 --> 1:41:38.883
Only with each other.

1:41:39.516 --> 1:41:40.918
Not much of a relationship.

1:41:42.519 --> 1:41:43.821
More like a détente,

1:41:45.388 --> 1:41:46.456
a cold war.

1:41:46.891 --> 1:41:48.358
No major blow ups

1:41:49.559 --> 1:41:52.429
without any outside forces
to instigate discord or strife,

1:41:53.765 --> 1:41:55.499
but a lot of lonely nights

1:41:55.800 --> 1:41:56.901
and internet porn,

1:41:57.668 --> 1:41:58.870
which weirdly enough,

1:41:59.402 --> 1:42:01.271
I think I'm more
into than he is.

1:42:03.540 --> 1:42:04.776
As for Aviva...

1:42:14.752 --> 1:42:16.087
<i>She finished her movie</i>

1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:18.288
<i>after a slow and painful
year of rehab.</i>

1:42:18.555 --> 1:42:20.858
<i>Achieved with an iron
will and courage,</i>

1:42:21.092 --> 1:42:23.661
<i>and an immense tolerance
for suffering.</i>

1:42:30.500 --> 1:42:32.069
<i>I've seen it a hundred times.</i>

1:42:35.372 --> 1:42:38.642
<i>And Aviva's capacity for
acceptance and forgiveness</i>

1:42:39.043 --> 1:42:42.013
<i>is as vast as the ocean
she once crossed</i>

1:42:42.046 --> 1:42:43.781
<i>in order to share
her life with me.</i>

1:42:46.449 --> 1:42:49.921
<i>And not a day will pass without
a message or a call between us.</i>

1:42:50.453 --> 1:42:52.890
<i>And we will work together
and play together</i>

1:42:54.926 --> 1:42:56.794
<i>and grow closer
than ever before.</i>

1:43:14.846 --> 1:43:15.980
<i>And one day...</i>

1:43:17.514 --> 1:43:18.615
Where is she?

1:43:19.183 --> 1:43:21.651
My girlfriend's
out there tonight.

1:43:21.686 --> 1:43:22.787
Where?

1:43:23.587 --> 1:43:24.856
There she is.

1:43:24.889 --> 1:43:26.724
<i>Bon jour, mon amour.</i>

1:43:26.757 --> 1:43:28.993
- <i>Bonsoir.</i>
- <i>Bonsoir.</i>

1:43:29.026 --> 1:43:30.061
What?

1:43:30.094 --> 1:43:32.163
Don't nothing rhyme
with <i>soir,</i> baby.

1:43:32.196 --> 1:43:34.732
I don't know
what to call you now.

1:43:34.765 --> 1:43:37.034
My girl is French. Crazy, too.

1:43:37.068 --> 1:43:39.436
Got me dancing under
active volcanos

1:43:39.469 --> 1:43:41.438
and all type of bridges
and whatnot...

1:43:41.471 --> 1:43:43.908
She's charming as hell though,
got my heart like

1:43:50.181 --> 1:43:51.816
She's complicated.

1:43:51.849 --> 1:43:54.051
Not only is she French, she's
Jewish, got an attitude

1:43:54.085 --> 1:43:55.753
and she feels guilty about it.

1:43:55.786 --> 1:43:57.487
And I feel guilty too,

1:43:57.520 --> 1:43:58.990
I drive a German car.

1:43:59.623 --> 1:44:01.625
The Jewish and German people
have a history

1:44:01.659 --> 1:44:02.894
I don't fully understand.

1:44:02.927 --> 1:44:05.029
All I know is that
when she's in the car

1:44:05.062 --> 1:44:06.764
I can't turn the heat on
without hearing shit

1:44:06.797 --> 1:44:08.766
about her grandmother.

1:44:08.799 --> 1:44:10.134
She gives me this look like...

1:44:10.167 --> 1:44:13.204
And I'm like, "Sorry,
I didn't kill your family!

1:44:13.237 --> 1:44:15.940
I'm just enjoying the
precision and cold-blooded

1:44:15.973 --> 1:44:18.109
technical efficiency
of those who did."

1:44:18.776 --> 1:44:19.810
Is that so wrong?

1:44:22.713 --> 1:44:25.917
When she laughs at a guy's
jokes, she's not pretending.

1:44:26.684 --> 1:44:28.485
Oh, he's amazing, right?

1:44:29.519 --> 1:44:30.788
He loves you.

1:44:33.124 --> 1:44:34.125
He does.

1:44:35.492 --> 1:44:36.661
And he's the best.

1:44:42.900 --> 1:44:44.769
It was a great show.

1:44:55.713 --> 1:44:57.614
I need to tell you something.

1:44:58.749 --> 1:44:59.817
Excuse me.

1:45:12.997 --> 1:45:14.699
I'm going to have a baby.

1:45:24.541 --> 1:45:25.743
When?

1:45:28.245 --> 1:45:29.747
Seven months.

1:45:42.625 --> 1:45:44.128
Everything's gonna change.

1:45:47.164 --> 1:45:49.233
Everything is always changing.

1:45:56.040 --> 1:45:56.974
Hello.

1:45:57.274 --> 1:45:58.809
Hello.

1:49:11.969 --> 1:49:13.837
You are my best friend

1:49:14.205 --> 1:49:15.472
in the world.
