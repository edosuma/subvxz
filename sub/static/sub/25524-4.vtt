00:01.400 --> 00:03.560
<i>‐Me and my men are to see</i>
<i>that this establishment</i>

00:03.640 --> 00:06.000
<i>does not continue</i>
<i>trading as a bawdy house.</i>

00:06.080 --> 00:08.160
<i>‐They left at first light.</i>

00:08.240 --> 00:09.840
<i>‐We found this in Kitty's hair.</i>

00:09.920 --> 00:12.840
<i>If you find that garment,</i>
<i>you'll find her killer.</i>

00:12.920 --> 00:15.400
‐Miss Wells, may I tempt
you out for a drive?

00:15.480 --> 00:17.320
‐Lord Fallon's made me
another offer.

00:17.360 --> 00:18.640
<i>He's sending for me tonight.</i>

00:18.760 --> 00:20.000
‐If you doubt
your man's affections,

00:20.120 --> 00:21.320
it's not because of me.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.520
<i>‐Tell your mother</i>
<i>to send my things.</i>

00:23.640 --> 00:24.960
I'm stopping here.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.160
‐I'm trying to act
against Quigley

00:26.200 --> 00:28.320
yet I find myself
doing her bidding.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.760
‐I want to destroy
Lydia Quigley.

00:30.840 --> 00:31.920
‐So do I.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.200
<i>‐Then we'll be allies</i>
<i>on one condition:</i>

00:34.280 --> 00:36.440
<i>that you have nothing</i>
<i>to do with my brother.</i>

00:36.480 --> 00:38.080
‐The only charge that
remains against Mrs. Quigley

00:38.160 --> 00:39.120
is running a brothel.

00:39.160 --> 00:40.960
Now, will you pay
her penalty or not?

00:41.080 --> 00:43.840
‐If you do this,
you cease to be mine.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.840
‐Never knew when to
keep quiet, did you?

01:19.520 --> 01:21.600
‐That old crone
went down like a drunk.

01:21.680 --> 01:24.040
‐Yeah, she'll be
an Irish beauty this morning.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.600
Two black eyes.

01:25.680 --> 01:26.760
‐You little gubshite!

01:26.880 --> 01:29.320
‐Enough!

01:29.400 --> 01:31.120
Remember you're on trial.

01:31.240 --> 01:34.480
One more trip,
you're back at Cheapside.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.960
‐What's that?

01:39.040 --> 01:40.680
‐Is it angry culls?

01:43.320 --> 01:44.680
‐Shit.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.680
That hellion Quigley!

02:02.760 --> 02:03.880
Did you see anything?

02:03.960 --> 02:05.240
Aye?

02:05.320 --> 02:07.160
‐No, Missus, nothing.
‐Nothing.

02:20.680 --> 02:23.680
Fanny, I need you to go
and fetch Nancy.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.120
Jacob, you're coming with me.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.680
You two stay here.

02:26.720 --> 02:27.960
‐Clean this up.
‐Yes.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.840
‐Mind you don't cut yourselves.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.240
Or each other!

02:47.960 --> 02:51.240
‐You are manna from heaven.

02:51.360 --> 02:55.720
‐Perhaps forbidden fruit
tastes sweeter.

02:55.840 --> 02:59.240
‐My sister told you
not to associate with me.

02:59.360 --> 03:03.120
‐And yet...you were
determined to bed me.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.840
One might assume
the two are connected.

03:07.560 --> 03:10.200
<i>‐A bientôt,</i> Miss Wells.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.200
‐You'll be returning.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.240
‐To you, yes.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.440
To this chintz‐pit, never.

03:36.560 --> 03:39.520
‐You didn't come to me
last night.

03:39.640 --> 03:42.080
‐Anticipation is half the joy.

03:46.680 --> 03:49.000
‐You're teasing me,
Lord Fallon.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.120
‐This is Miss Wells

03:59.200 --> 04:01.680
and she will be your mistress.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.360
You will treat her
as if she were my wife.

04:22.079 --> 04:23.440
‐What about her?

04:26.000 --> 04:29.320
‐No, no, not Sally Perkins.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.680
She's a beauty,
but she's got the flap dragon.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.200
What about her?

04:40.640 --> 04:43.560
‐She has three meals a day
and they're all gin.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.760
‐Oh, well, then the dark one.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.880
Cor, she's a diamond.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.560
‐I thought we needed variation.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.960
‐Do you know how many blonde
blowses there are in Soho?

04:59.000 --> 05:02.760
I just ride the pole
better than any of them.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.320
Don't let a little
competition scare you.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.000
‐Bare‐knuckle fighters earn
a king's ransom,

05:07.080 --> 05:09.200
you know that.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.960
‐Where would you hold it,
if I fought?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.880
‐Right here.

05:13.960 --> 05:17.200
Chalk circle
for a sparring ring.

05:17.320 --> 05:20.200
Land blows like you land buttock
and you might just win.

05:25.320 --> 05:29.000
‐How much for a brush
with Miss Lennox?

05:29.080 --> 05:30.760
‐I'm not her pimp.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.320
‐Well, come on then.

05:42.880 --> 05:43.880
‐Come on!

05:48.760 --> 05:50.000
‐I need you to mind him.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.680
There's been an attack
on the house.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.640
‐You've baited Quigley again.

05:56.680 --> 06:00.200
‐She was at the Pleasure Gardens
with Mrs. May.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.000
Called me Little Maggie.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.520
That's why I hit her.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.520
‐Well, she probably
had it coming.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.640
‐You stay close
to your pa today.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.440
‐What about you?

06:38.880 --> 06:40.880
‐I heard you battered
the old moth.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.200
Bet she was fluttering all night

06:42.240 --> 06:43.960
thinking about ways to chaw you.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.840
‐This is just the start.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.880
‐Mrs. Quigley, your face.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.680
‐Oh.

06:54.760 --> 06:58.200
The Marquess left satisfied,
I trust.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.240
‐He enjoyed me...

07:00.320 --> 07:01.760
but not our surroundings.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.760
It's like rutting
in a doll's house.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.200
‐I cannot stand
another day here.

07:07.320 --> 07:10.200
That Justice has my business
in a chokehold.

07:10.240 --> 07:15.000
‐The whole of London's corrupt
and he thinks he's different.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.880
‐Perhaps we should
test his virtue.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.880
‐The court has been known
to take funding

07:27.000 --> 07:28.760
from a variety of sources

07:28.880 --> 07:31.880
and endow it to worthy causes.

07:31.960 --> 07:34.080
Hospitals, almshouses.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.840
‐To what are you alluding?

07:35.880 --> 07:38.240
‐Well, we would like
to support your endeavors.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.000
‐Bribery is an illegal practice,
Mrs. Quigley.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.440
‐You cannot keep me
from my own home!

07:43.520 --> 07:45.400
‐I am not, I am simply
forbidding you

07:45.440 --> 07:46.640
from operating within it.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.200
Good day.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.560
‐That man is an impediment.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.840
We must make it our duty
to remove him.

07:52.880 --> 07:56.080
‐The Marquess could eat him
alive if he wanted to.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.640
‐Then we must make him want to.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.640
Hunt cannot bar us
from Golden Square

08:02.680 --> 08:04.880
as long as we stay chaste
within it.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.680
Go back and gather the girls.

08:06.760 --> 08:09.120
We'll send word to Abbadon
to prepare the house.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.520
I have business
with this harridan.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.080
I'd almost forgotten about you.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.440
‐Leave me alone, Quigley.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.400
You make my blood run cold.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.880
‐I think probably
that's the rags you're wearing.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.440
Where are you living,
under a wagon?

08:23.560 --> 08:26.200
‐Mrs. Wells has shown us
kindness and charity,

08:26.320 --> 08:27.680
virtues you know nothing of.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.400
‐You're staying
at Greek Street?

08:32.320 --> 08:35.799
Mrs. Wells will have you
praying with your knees upward

08:35.840 --> 08:36.840
in no time.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.200
‐I work for God alone.

08:38.320 --> 08:42.200
‐You work for me
when I tell you to!

08:59.680 --> 09:01.840
‐Charlotte?

09:08.160 --> 09:09.960
It was her, wasn't it?

09:10.080 --> 09:11.680
The windows.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.720
Now you be careful

09:15.840 --> 09:18.040
because your head
is in the lion's mouth.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.480
‐Why?

09:19.560 --> 09:23.320
If the blood
running through it is Quigley's.

09:23.360 --> 09:26.320
‐You're as reckless as I am.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.080
That's why you'll always
be a Wells woman.

09:32.600 --> 09:35.080
She coming for me again?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.720
‐She lets nothing slip.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.440
‐Do you have her trust?

09:39.480 --> 09:41.920
‐I'm close.

09:41.960 --> 09:46.160
‐You get inside her mind,
like a madness.

09:46.200 --> 09:49.720
I want to know every
sick notion she spits up.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.960
You're our Trojan horse,
Charlotte,

09:52.080 --> 09:54.720
and you're inside Troy's gates.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.080
‐I don't have an army.
‐Not yet,

09:57.200 --> 10:00.440
but I'll gather one.

10:00.560 --> 10:04.280
Now you find a spark
and I'll light it

10:04.320 --> 10:06.440
and we'll burn her
to the ground.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.560
‐There are people like you
at the palace, you know?

11:10.600 --> 11:12.800
The entertainment for royalty.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.680
‐You're the only king I know of.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.800
King of Old Compton Street.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.320
‐This house is just
the beginning, you know.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.560
You should see the finery
of my mother's.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.480
My inheritance, of course.

11:24.560 --> 11:28.840
‐Look what we found!

11:28.960 --> 11:31.440
A new blackbird
for our menagerie.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.320
‐Long way from the docks.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.960
I might finally wash the
sailor's brine out me gullet.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.600
‐Oh, isn't she comely?

11:37.680 --> 11:39.040
‐She's sublime.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.840
‐This is the sort of girl
we should be recruiting,

11:41.920 --> 11:43.960
not that half‐pint.

11:44.040 --> 11:46.920
‐Why does a white wagtail
want black whores?

11:46.960 --> 11:48.680
‐Men come here
for something different

11:48.800 --> 11:49.960
and pay a fine penny for it.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.560
‐That's right.
This is a house of exotics.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.800
‐Tighten your stays
and paint your faces, ladies.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.440
You're going a‐hunting
for cuffins.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.200
‐Yes!

12:15.680 --> 12:17.440
‐Morning.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.080
‐What have you been up to?

12:19.160 --> 12:20.960
‐Oh...

12:21.080 --> 12:23.480
I have been...

12:23.560 --> 12:25.960
in the guts of a goddess.

12:27.480 --> 12:31.480
The celestial Miss Wells.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.960
What?

12:33.040 --> 12:34.680
Well, you seemed
so captivated by her,

12:34.800 --> 12:37.080
I wanted to see what
all the fuss was about.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.960
‐And did you?
‐Mm.

12:39.080 --> 12:43.320
I've never known a harlot
who seems to enjoy the act

12:43.440 --> 12:44.680
as much as the money.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.680
‐It's her job, perhaps
she's just good at it.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.160
‐Hm.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.840
Why does it disturb you so?

12:51.920 --> 12:53.200
Hm?

12:53.280 --> 12:54.800
Hey.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.840
Where are you going?

12:56.960 --> 12:59.200
Isabella?

12:59.280 --> 13:01.320
‐You seem to think I have
some unnatural lust

13:01.360 --> 13:03.440
for Miss Wells.

13:03.480 --> 13:06.840
Perhaps I should find out
if you're right.

13:10.680 --> 13:13.440
‐Your broken windows
aren't my business.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.840
‐Once you're on her list,
you're never off.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.080
‐Even if I end up dead,
you're next.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.440
‐Why should I do anything
for you?

13:21.560 --> 13:24.080
You nearly sent me
to the sky yourself.

13:26.040 --> 13:28.720
‐I never should have
endangered you.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.840
You were my best girl once.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.200
I'm sorry.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.440
‐

13:36.560 --> 13:38.680
Well, I'll be dicked.

13:38.800 --> 13:42.200
An apology from Margaret Wells.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.080
‐Go to the Justice.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.680
Say what you know.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.320
‐Hello, my dear.
‐What is this gaudy mob?

14:02.440 --> 14:04.680
‐My darling boy.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.840
I see you've brought
the whole zoo.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.680
‐Not a zoo, mother,
but an aviary

14:09.800 --> 14:13.040
of rare and exotic delights.

14:13.080 --> 14:16.320
Cherry here can flirt the
fortune out of a miser's hand.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.560
‐And how are you selling
this foreign fowl?

14:21.680 --> 14:24.160
‐Emily Lacey warned us
about you.

14:24.200 --> 14:28.600
She said you were
a mildewed bloodsucker.

14:28.680 --> 14:32.160
‐You won't make a penny
in her house.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.560
‐It's my house.

14:34.600 --> 14:38.080
‐Then put your scold
in her bridle.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.200
If she smears
or maligns me again,

14:40.280 --> 14:44.200
even to these jades,
I will make good my threat.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.960
Am I clear?

14:50.480 --> 14:51.960
‐Come on, my doves.

14:57.840 --> 15:01.840
‐I could do things for you,
maypole.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.440
Come and see me.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.320
‐Over here!

15:21.720 --> 15:23.560
‐You must bite back.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.960
Send your men folk to tamper
with the wheels of her coach.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.960
‐Mrs. Scanwell,
how un‐Christian.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.360
Business is our best defense.

15:33.440 --> 15:37.440
There is no protection
like a house full of rich men.

15:37.560 --> 15:41.720
When I get them in,
don't you scare them away.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.960
‐Why are you so shaken, Mother?

15:47.040 --> 15:48.440
‐We must find a shield
of our own

15:48.560 --> 15:50.160
against Quigley's evil.

16:09.440 --> 16:12.480
‐That's it,
tattle to your master.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.320
Lady Isabella.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.680
‐I came for a moment
with Miss Wells.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.720
‐Ah.

16:27.840 --> 16:31.720
Miss Wells' time
comes at a price.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.160
‐You promised.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.800
‐He paid me 100 guineas.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.080
‐Oh, I should have known.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.480
A harlot can always be bought.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.440
‐My body, yes,
but not my mind.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.240
‐He takes everything
that is mine

17:05.319 --> 17:06.720
and makes it his.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.920
I live in a chamber of mirrors

17:09.040 --> 17:10.760
and his is
the only reflection I see.

17:10.839 --> 17:11.839
‐Then you must shatter it.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.760
‐I can't.
‐You can.

17:14.839 --> 17:17.280
You locate a weakness...

17:17.319 --> 17:19.040
and you press.

17:19.079 --> 17:22.599
‐Did you learn that
from Mrs. Quigley?

17:22.720 --> 17:24.560
‐She's the only one
I wish to break.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.560
‐How can I help?

17:34.800 --> 17:37.840
‐She wants me to get close
with your brother again.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.040
‐I understand.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.560
‐Is there anything else
you want?

17:55.560 --> 17:57.160
You've already paid.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.840
‐I...

18:12.360 --> 18:15.720
My brother's card party,
tomorrow.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.040
Two o'clock.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.720
Bring the bitch.

18:36.560 --> 18:39.560
‐There have been mutterings
about you, Fallon.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.560
That our vessel is leaking.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.720
That you are the fissure.

18:46.240 --> 18:49.120
‐I have righted any wrongs
I may have caused.

18:49.240 --> 18:52.000
‐A Spartan does not blunder.

18:52.080 --> 18:56.600
‐The High Priestess was
endangered by a baying bawd,

18:56.720 --> 18:58.240
but I have silenced her.

18:58.320 --> 19:01.400
‐How?
‐I have a hostage.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.880
Her own daughter.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.080
She is exquisite.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.840
And totally in my thrall.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.840
Miss Lucy Wells.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.560
Lucy, this is
the Marquess of Blayne.

19:20.600 --> 19:21.720
‐Pleasure, my lord.

19:21.800 --> 19:22.920
‐Madam.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.840
‐Enjoy your evening.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.080
‐Where are you going?

19:29.480 --> 19:31.080
‐Out.

19:38.800 --> 19:42.080
‐Well, Fallon,
it seems we're going out.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.400
‐I've secured us an invitation

19:59.520 --> 20:02.480
to the Marquess'
gathering tomorrow.

20:02.560 --> 20:06.080
‐Clever cat.

20:06.120 --> 20:09.840
‐What was your son's girl
doing here?

20:09.920 --> 20:12.240
‐That's not for you to know.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.760
‐There's only two things
you could have wanted with her.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.280
First, to join your house.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.120
But she'd be a black swan
in a white flock

20:21.240 --> 20:25.560
and I can't see
that pleasing you.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.640
Second...

20:28.760 --> 20:31.080
you want eyes
in Charles' house.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.120
‐Well, ponder this...

20:37.240 --> 20:39.560
she rejected my proposition.

20:42.760 --> 20:47.040
‐The gleam of Golden Square
may have scared her off.

20:47.080 --> 20:51.320
I'll take her some coins
and tell her she's safe with us.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.720
‐I've never seen
so much powder in my life.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.400
‐Well, the bigger the wig,
the smaller the pintle.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.840
‐Big or small, you stroke
until they're gushing gold.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.480
‐Let's go elsewhere.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.920
‐Did you hear, Fallon?

21:45.040 --> 21:47.080
Your keeper has spoken.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.760
‐We're staying.

21:50.840 --> 21:53.760
You will be the light
that luminates this room.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.480
‐Ma, what are you doing here?

21:57.560 --> 21:59.280
You never come here.

21:59.320 --> 22:02.080
‐Showing off my new girls.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.240
There was an attack
on the house this morning.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.880
We have to pay for new windows.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.320
‐An attack?

22:07.400 --> 22:09.320
Is anyone hurt?

22:09.400 --> 22:12.080
‐All are safe
and we won't be daunted.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.840
You look like a queen.

22:17.880 --> 22:22.280
‐And I am nothing
but her loyal subject.

22:22.320 --> 22:23.920
‐Lord Fallon.

22:30.120 --> 22:33.080
‐Fallon has a minx
in his house...

22:33.160 --> 22:35.600
who gives him orders
like a major.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.600
Go over and take a slice of her.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.520
I want to see
how the boy reacts.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.160
‐My lord, Fallon will not...

22:49.120 --> 22:51.160
‐Fallon, I have friends
for you to meet.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.720
‐Are you Fallon's new pony?

23:03.800 --> 23:07.040
Pray tell, the rest of us
going to be allowed a ride?

23:09.640 --> 23:11.840
‐Sorry, my lord,

23:11.880 --> 23:15.560
but you couldn't afford
a share in me.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.560
‐I see I'm filling
your eyes, my lord.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.840
How about we fill those hands?

23:34.920 --> 23:37.120
‐You're not to my fancy.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.840
‐Come now, my lord.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.480
You haven't even had a taste.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.280
‐Come here, filly.

23:47.320 --> 23:50.120
I want to see what tricks
you can do.

23:50.240 --> 23:53.040
Do you need a lock
to your hide?

23:57.080 --> 23:59.560
‐Damn you, Lidington,
keep your hands off her

23:59.600 --> 24:01.480
or I'll brand them myself.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.160
‐Mrs. Wells.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.840
That man, his buttons
are the same.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.520
‐We need to see the Justice.

24:19.560 --> 24:20.560
‐He's asleep.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.040
‐Well, wake him.
‐What's so pressing?

24:23.080 --> 24:24.920
‐What madness is this?

24:25.040 --> 24:27.560
It's the middle of the night.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.600
‐Lord Lidington.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.840
That is his name.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.720
The man who murdered my girl.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.040
He left his button in her hair.

24:38.080 --> 24:40.080
The button I gave you.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.120
You've done nothing about it.

24:42.240 --> 24:46.000
Lord Lidington.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.320
‐Are you all right?

25:03.560 --> 25:05.640
‐He doesn't scare me.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.800
‐What does scare you?

25:34.360 --> 25:36.520
Not tonight.

25:36.560 --> 25:37.920
‐Why?

25:42.320 --> 25:44.320
‐I want you to ache for me.

25:47.800 --> 25:51.880
<i>‐What does the devil want now?</i>

25:52.000 --> 25:54.280
‐I'm not here for Mrs. Quigley.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.280
‐Oh, you still have
thoughts of your own?

25:57.320 --> 25:58.880
‐I'm not who you think I am.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.320
‐Pretty little fuck‐puppet.
‐Emily.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.560
I'm working against her.

26:08.720 --> 26:10.840
‐She finds that out...

26:10.880 --> 26:12.840
she'll pull out your beef
and spread it across Soho.

26:12.880 --> 26:14.480
‐That is why I need your help.

26:14.560 --> 26:17.880
‐Help you?

26:18.000 --> 26:19.840
You want to gamble your life
on bad odds,

26:19.920 --> 26:22.240
go ahead.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.760
But I got a house of me own

26:23.840 --> 26:25.040
and girls to fill it.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.880
Why would I risk all that?

26:27.000 --> 26:31.040
‐Because she plots
to tear it apart.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.720
‐What do you mean?

26:32.800 --> 26:35.080
‐Ask your girl.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.400
The tall one.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.360
‐Nell, get in here.

26:50.880 --> 26:53.560
‐If I'm right,
Quigley sent for her

26:53.640 --> 26:57.840
and offered her money
to spy on you.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.080
‐Is it true?

27:00.160 --> 27:01.840
‐She wanted me to seduce her son

27:01.880 --> 27:03.520
and drip poison in his ear,

27:03.560 --> 27:04.760
but I denied her.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.000
‐Why?

27:06.080 --> 27:08.040
‐Quigley can keep her money.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.480
That old ghoul
gives me the chills.

27:22.320 --> 27:25.320
‐She'll never leave you alone.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.720
Not until you're mad or dead.

27:44.240 --> 27:48.000
‐So she gave you this house
to tie your tongue?

27:48.080 --> 27:49.320
‐I'm the only soul
still breathing

27:49.400 --> 27:50.800
who knows her truth.

27:52.560 --> 27:57.040
My knowledge pains her
like a maggot in a wound.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.280
She wants to cut me out.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.320
‐You let me and my children
move into a house

28:01.400 --> 28:02.560
built on sand.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.120
‐No.

28:04.240 --> 28:05.880
No.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.600
I'm going to end it.

28:07.720 --> 28:08.840
I'm going to make
this house mine.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.120
‐How?

28:11.240 --> 28:14.000
‐I'm going to send Dame Death
to the gallows.

28:37.640 --> 28:42.080
‐You're a nasty, dirty,
cunny rat!

28:42.160 --> 28:44.080
Your cock is a hungry fiend!

28:44.120 --> 28:45.560
‐Filthier!

28:45.600 --> 28:47.520
‐Your balls are
the devil's arms.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.760
‐Filthier!

28:48.840 --> 28:50.800
‐Your mother was
a thieving troll.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.360
‐Filthier!

29:14.320 --> 29:16.360
‐I mean no offense,

29:16.480 --> 29:19.320
but that was really,
really expensive.

29:19.400 --> 29:22.520
‐Well, I am.
Because I'm exotic.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.360
‐Not exotic to me.
‐You're not getting a discount.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.640
‐But you didn't enjoy it.

29:29.080 --> 29:31.480
‐That's not what I'm paid for.

29:31.560 --> 29:34.640
‐Let me pleasure you for free,

29:34.760 --> 29:38.320
and you can pretend
I'm whoever you want me to be.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.920
‐You said you'd treat me
as your wife.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.320
But I'm not your wife,
I'm your whore,

30:11.400 --> 30:14.160
and you will treat me as such.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.800
‐And how would you
have me do that?

30:24.800 --> 30:27.080
‐Well, I see you're playing
the courtesan.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.600
‐Yes.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.360
Lucy is quite at ease here.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.080
I assume that's
why you've come.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.320
To make certain
of her comfort.

30:37.360 --> 30:40.600
‐About the dispute last night.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.360
‐It was nothing, Ma.

30:43.480 --> 30:45.480
‐Lord Lidington.

30:45.560 --> 30:48.920
Is that man a friend of yours,
Lord Fallon?

30:49.040 --> 30:50.160
‐Certainly not.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.760
He's a drunk and a fool.

30:52.840 --> 30:56.080
I assure you, he'll never come
near your daughter again.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.840
‐You stay away from him.

30:57.920 --> 30:59.560
‐I'm happy, Ma.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.840
Don't fret.

31:00.920 --> 31:03.640
Let me show you out.

31:09.480 --> 31:13.240
Don't remember you chasing
Charlotte around like this.

31:13.320 --> 31:15.560
‐You're different creatures.

31:15.600 --> 31:18.320
‐What does that mean?

31:18.400 --> 31:21.280
‐The way you went for that man.

31:21.320 --> 31:22.600
I fear for you.

31:22.720 --> 31:24.080
‐Leave me alone, Ma.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.760
‐Your guests, Isabella.

31:49.480 --> 31:52.640
‐I thought you'd be glad
to see your whore.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.120
‐Marquess, a pleasure.

31:57.240 --> 31:58.600
We don't mean to rankle you.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.920
‐We would be honored
to enter your games,

32:01.040 --> 32:02.560
if you will allow us.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.360
‐We're playing Bestia.

32:04.480 --> 32:07.400
Pertinent, given
our beastly host.

32:07.520 --> 32:09.480
‐Your proficiency at cards
precedes you, Miss Wells.

32:09.560 --> 32:13.480
You drained my sister of
a significant sum, did you not?

32:13.560 --> 32:14.640
‐Well, indeed.

32:14.760 --> 32:19.600
Miss Wells' deft hand
will impress you no end.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.040
‐Please.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.840
‐You have an instinct
for violence.

32:31.920 --> 32:35.560
I can see that in you.

32:35.640 --> 32:38.080
I want to show you
how to use it.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.560
<i>‐Gioco.</i>

32:58.280 --> 33:00.720
You saw my sister last night

33:00.800 --> 33:03.040
and I saw yours.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.040
What a strange dance
we're all doing.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.920
<i>‐Gioco.</i>

33:07.040 --> 33:12.120
Why do you and your sister
jostle like you do?

33:12.240 --> 33:15.360
‐Well, the dynamic
of a family is...

33:15.480 --> 33:18.920
hard to explain.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.400
How did you end up
at Quigley's house

33:20.520 --> 33:22.480
when your mother has
one of her own?

33:22.560 --> 33:26.520
‐My family's dynamic
is as inexplicable as yours.

33:29.560 --> 33:33.120
‐Then why do you not
have a keeper?

33:33.240 --> 33:34.880
‐My last one was killed.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.640
Understandably,
it has put me off.

33:36.760 --> 33:38.080
‐Of course.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.240
‐It's your pot, Blayne.

33:39.320 --> 33:40.360
‐Oh.

33:43.120 --> 33:46.640
When I bleed
this rich room dry,

33:46.760 --> 33:49.160
how about I push
the profits your way

33:49.280 --> 33:51.040
and you come and stay with me?

33:51.080 --> 33:54.920
I would like to have you
as mine, Miss Wells.

33:55.040 --> 33:57.760
You have until the end
of the game to decide.

34:04.320 --> 34:06.040
<i>‐Gioco.</i>

34:15.280 --> 34:16.840
<i>‐Gioco.</i>

34:16.920 --> 34:19.360
‐Four cards.

34:19.440 --> 34:22.719
A risk‐taker.

34:22.800 --> 34:26.360
‐In battle, it is the cowards
who run the most risk.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.520
‐And bravery is a rampart
of the defense.

34:29.639 --> 34:31.440
You know your Roman philosophy.

34:31.520 --> 34:33.440
‐I always preferred it
to the Greek.

34:33.520 --> 34:38.040
‐The Greeks invented
rational thought.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.000
‐Hm.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.440
But the Romans
had a greater empire.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.719
‐I don't believe
we've been introduced.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.920
‐Mrs. Quigley is a bawd.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.800
She's quite famous in her field,
did you know that, my lord?

34:57.120 --> 35:00.040
Lord Dodds
is the Lord Chief Justice.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.480
‐It seems to me so odd
that a woman

35:05.600 --> 35:07.920
of your beauty and breeding

35:08.000 --> 35:09.200
is not married.

35:12.040 --> 35:15.040
Do you not long for children?

35:17.600 --> 35:20.920
Ah, look, I win the trick.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.720
‐Would you take a turn
around the room with me,

35:24.800 --> 35:27.400
Mrs. Quigley?

35:37.880 --> 35:40.280
‐Are you trying
to have me hanged?

35:40.320 --> 35:41.800
‐You are playing with fire.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.840
‐And who lit the tinder?

35:43.920 --> 35:46.040
‐Perhaps I'm tired
of behaving.

35:46.160 --> 35:49.160
‐Hm, and perhaps I shall
tire of keeping the secret

35:49.240 --> 35:51.840
of your bastard child!

35:51.920 --> 35:55.680
‐And reveal how you've been
fleecing me for years?

35:55.760 --> 36:00.000
I wonder what penalty
Lord Chief Justice would impose

36:00.120 --> 36:02.840
for the crime of extortion.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.760
‐I'll see the Justice.

36:33.840 --> 36:36.240
‐Well played, sir.

36:36.320 --> 36:39.280
‐So, have you made
your decision?

36:39.320 --> 36:41.480
‐About what?

36:41.600 --> 36:43.800
‐I want to be
Miss Wells' keeper.

36:45.320 --> 36:47.960
‐It's an attractive offer...

36:48.040 --> 36:50.040
but I value my freedom.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.160
‐600 a year.

36:53.240 --> 36:55.600
‐Harcourt,
you're being vulgar.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.040
‐Vulgar?

36:58.160 --> 37:01.720
You invited the brothel
to the party.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.040
Very well.

37:05.640 --> 37:09.320
All that to have you right now.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.240
‐Show me to your rooms.

37:32.240 --> 37:36.120
‐I now know why you revere
our Latin forebears.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.320
‐My lord?

37:37.400 --> 37:40.160
‐They welcome prostitutes
without moral qualm.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.840
‐Ah.

37:41.880 --> 37:47.240
Lord Dodds, my home
is a sanctuary for young ladies.

37:47.320 --> 37:50.520
‐So it's discreet.

37:50.640 --> 37:53.200
‐We could take a tour...

37:53.280 --> 37:55.600
should it arouse your interest.

37:55.680 --> 37:57.400
‐Hm.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.760
‐Miss Lacey cannot be seen here.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.960
Her life
is precariously balanced.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.800
‐I have issues to settle
here in court.

38:10.840 --> 38:13.160
‐Her story concerns
Lydia Quigley.

38:13.240 --> 38:16.440
‐I am sick of hearing
that woman's name.

38:20.840 --> 38:24.240
‐I have also been a victim
of her crimes.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.840
I...I urge you, Justice,

38:28.920 --> 38:30.880
come with me.

38:33.360 --> 38:36.280
‐She said there was
a pack of hounds coming for me.

38:36.320 --> 38:40.320
‐Do you know who they were?

38:40.360 --> 38:43.800
‐Just that once they took me,
I wasn't coming back.

38:51.720 --> 38:55.160
‐Is it enough?

38:55.240 --> 38:57.120
‐I need your assurance
that you'll stand up

38:57.200 --> 38:59.520
in a court of law
and give evidence publicly

38:59.640 --> 39:01.840
against Lydia Quigley.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.400
Do I have your word?

39:04.480 --> 39:05.640
‐You do.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.640
‐You do.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.760
‐Oh yes.

39:30.640 --> 39:32.280
‐Ah.

39:33.480 --> 39:35.320
Good evening, constables.

39:43.880 --> 39:48.760
Let me introduce you
to Miss Anne Pettifer.

39:48.840 --> 39:53.240
Sharp as a tack,
but sweet as a peach.

39:53.320 --> 39:55.760
‐A pleasure to meet you,
my lord.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.760
‐I mean no offense
to Miss Pettifer,

39:59.840 --> 40:01.600
but I see no woman in this room

40:01.680 --> 40:05.040
who is superior to you,
Mrs. Quigley.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.320
‐Oh.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.880
‐I prefer...

40:11.960 --> 40:14.160
a riper fruit.

40:25.120 --> 40:27.320
‐Again.

40:35.320 --> 40:36.880
Very good.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.000
More aggressive.

41:29.200 --> 41:32.280
‐I haven't done this
for quite some time.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.200
‐We can be as slow
as you like.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.520
‐Fuck me.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.400
Now.

43:05.920 --> 43:09.320
‐Oh, Justice Dodds!

43:09.360 --> 43:11.400
‐Tally‐ho, Mrs. Quigley!

43:11.480 --> 43:13.240
Tally‐ho!

43:25.520 --> 43:27.640
‐Mrs. Lydia Quigley,
you're under arrest for‐‐

43:27.720 --> 43:29.680
‐Get out!

43:29.760 --> 43:31.200
Never in my life have I‐‐

43:31.280 --> 43:33.280
‐
We have a warrant

43:33.320 --> 43:35.440
for Mrs. Quigley's arrest.

43:35.520 --> 43:38.840
‐Clear the flesh markets
of Covent Garden,

43:38.920 --> 43:42.200
strip the streets
of vice and pox,

43:42.280 --> 43:44.600
close the slum brothels,

43:44.680 --> 43:49.680
but these bawdy houses
are our bawdy houses

43:49.760 --> 43:52.920
and you will not
take our whores!

43:53.000 --> 43:54.880
‐I am sorry, Lord Dodds,
but this arrest is not for‐‐

43:54.960 --> 44:00.320
‐Be gone or I will boot you
from the law courts

44:00.400 --> 44:03.000
and into the Thames.

44:05.160 --> 44:08.440
‐Oh, Doddy!

44:08.520 --> 44:09.680
‐Charlotte.

44:09.760 --> 44:12.240
‐Don't fear, he's spent
all his anger on me.

44:12.320 --> 44:14.280
‐Stay a moment.
‐I need a drink.

44:14.320 --> 44:17.160
‐I'll accompany you.

44:17.240 --> 44:18.840
‐You don't want to go
where I'm going.

44:18.920 --> 44:21.040
‐Where?

44:21.160 --> 44:22.960
‐Home.

44:30.680 --> 44:32.240
‐Come here!

44:39.400 --> 44:40.800
‐Where's Quigley?

44:40.840 --> 44:42.320
‐It is no use.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.440
‐What happened?
‐She is like a weed.

44:44.520 --> 44:46.800
Cut her down
and she grows back stronger.

44:46.840 --> 44:48.880
‐What do you mean?

44:48.960 --> 44:52.680
‐She has the Lord Chief Justice
between her thighs.

45:07.360 --> 45:10.240
‐You got a spark
in your throat tonight.

45:10.320 --> 45:13.360
‐I'll either be free
or dead tomorrow.

45:13.440 --> 45:15.680
Either way,
a sore head won't matter.

45:15.760 --> 45:17.600
‐Come on.

45:17.680 --> 45:20.360
Nance, put your money
on Webster.

45:22.480 --> 45:24.280
He's a cub.

45:24.320 --> 45:26.280
Could be a lion.

45:26.320 --> 45:29.480
‐I haven't seen you like this
for years.

45:29.600 --> 45:31.440
‐Ladies and gentlemen,

45:31.520 --> 45:33.800
may I have your attention,
please?

45:33.840 --> 45:37.920
You are about to witness
a clash of fabled fighters!

45:39.440 --> 45:41.440
Billy "The Badger" O'Reilly!

45:44.280 --> 45:46.440
Noah "The Storm" Webster!

45:51.520 --> 45:54.280
Place your bets now!

45:54.320 --> 45:55.880
Three,

45:55.960 --> 45:57.160
two,

45:57.240 --> 45:58.440
one!

45:58.520 --> 45:59.840
Fight!

46:16.600 --> 46:18.800
‐Come on, you!
‐Yeah!

46:41.520 --> 46:43.160
‐Here, place your bets.

46:49.200 --> 46:51.720
‐She's eluded us this time.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.200
The Justice failed.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.600
But we're your
sisters in arms now

46:55.680 --> 46:59.040
and I won't let any harm
come to you.

47:11.640 --> 47:14.840
‐Just this way.

47:17.440 --> 47:20.160
‐What a sad sight.

47:20.240 --> 47:24.000
Is there no business for you
in Lilliput?

47:24.120 --> 47:28.960
‐Your son's doxie plans
to sell you to the Justice.

47:29.040 --> 47:32.280
‐How do you know?
‐Heard her myself.

47:33.840 --> 47:36.240
‐Why have you come
to tell me this?

47:36.320 --> 47:39.120
‐You chose the wrong girl
for your spy.

47:39.200 --> 47:41.720
I think the world of your son,

47:41.800 --> 47:43.720
and he takes delight in me.

47:45.480 --> 47:48.240
I will prize them apart
like a wishbone.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.200
‐We each have our own
boiling rage against her.

48:05.720 --> 48:08.520
We cannot let it fog our sight.

48:08.640 --> 48:10.040
‐We need to fight like her.

48:10.160 --> 48:11.200
‐Cold‐hearted?

48:11.280 --> 48:13.920
‐Calculated.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.920
‐We strike once

48:16.000 --> 48:18.320
and we strike right.

48:19.720 --> 48:23.120
‐We're a five‐headed beast now.

48:23.200 --> 48:25.360
You just tell us
when to roar.
