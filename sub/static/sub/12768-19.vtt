00:07.625 --> 00:08.834
(sighs)

00:08.875 --> 00:10.834
I'M HERE. I'M HERE.
YOU PAGED ME.

00:10.875 --> 00:14.375
WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT BABY
IN MY HOSPITAL?
IT'S LUCAS. PETE'S SON.

00:14.417 --> 00:16.792
HE HAD A CHILD, REMEMBER?
YOU WERE THERE.

00:16.834 --> 00:20.542
(lowered voice) WHY DO YOU HAVE
THAT BABY IN MY HOSPITAL?
PETE IS TAKING OVER FOR NAI
WHILE SHE IS OUT OF TOWN.

00:20.583 --> 00:23.542
YOU PAGED 9-1-1.
I WAS LOOKING AFTER LUCAS.
WHY DO YOU HAVE--

00:23.583 --> 00:25.792
THE NANNY IS MEETING ME HERE
ANY MINUTE.

00:25.834 --> 00:28.542
NOW COME ON. WHAT IS UP?
(normal voice) KAYLA LINDY,
THE COMA MAMA--

00:28.583 --> 00:31.166
HER HUSBAND'S BRINGING IN
THE BIG GUNS.
WHICH BIG GUNS?

00:31.208 --> 00:33.125
DR. GERALDINE GINSBERG.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.667
AHH.
HE'S FLYING IN GINSBERG?

00:35.709 --> 00:38.542
HE WANTS HER TO WAKE HIS WIFE
UP FROM THE COMA.

00:38.583 --> 00:41.333
YOU GONNA KEEP PLAYING MOMMY
OR YOU GONNA GET IN THERE?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.333
OKAY. HERE.
TAKE THE BABY.
(babbles)

00:43.375 --> 00:45.041
TAKE THE BABY, CHARLOTTE.

00:45.083 --> 00:47.125
TAKE THE BABY. OKAY?

00:47.166 --> 00:50.125
YEAH. THE NANNY WILL BE HERE
IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES, OKAY?

00:50.166 --> 00:52.625
HERE YOU GO.
TAKE IT. MM.

00:52.667 --> 00:55.667
OOH. BE GOOD.
(babbles)

00:55.709 --> 00:58.166
(exhales deeply) HELLO.

00:58.208 --> 01:00.875
I'M CHARLOTTE.

01:00.917 --> 01:03.083
PLEASE DON'T DROOL
ON ME.

01:03.125 --> 01:05.875
(Eddie) AND THEN DREW GOT
A TRIPLE, SLID INTO THIRD

01:05.917 --> 01:08.875
AND SCRAPED THE HELL OUT OF
HIS ANKLE, BUT YOU KNOW DREW.

01:08.917 --> 01:12.834
HE DIDN'T CARE. YOU'D HAVE BEEN
REALLY PROUD OF HIM. HEY.

01:12.875 --> 01:16.041
SO... DR. MONTGOMERY'S HERE.

01:16.083 --> 01:19.250
AND DR. GINSBERG WILL BE HERE
ANY MINUTE NOW.

01:19.291 --> 01:23.709
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

01:23.750 --> 01:25.792
I KNOW YOU THINK
SHE CAN'T HEAR ME,

01:25.834 --> 01:27.834
BUT, UH...
MAYBE SHE CAN.

01:27.875 --> 01:30.834
A-AND WHEN DR. GINSBERG
GETS HERE AND WAKES HER UP,

01:30.875 --> 01:32.834
I JUST WANT HER TO KNOW
THAT...

01:32.875 --> 01:34.959
I DIDN'T GIVE UP ON HER.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.875
EDDIE,
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

01:37.917 --> 01:40.083
DR. GINSBERG IS AN EXTREMELY
ACCOMPLISHED NEUROSURGEON,

01:40.125 --> 01:42.291
BUT KAYLA HAS BEEN...

01:42.333 --> 01:44.291
SHE'S BEEN IN A COMA
FOR SIX WEEKS.

01:44.333 --> 01:46.834
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET YOUR HOPES UP.

01:46.875 --> 01:49.125
DID YOU KNOW
GINSBERG REVIVED A PATIENT

01:49.166 --> 01:51.834
WHO WAS COMATOSE FOR 17 YEARS?
I'LL GET MY MIRACLE.

01:51.875 --> 01:55.125
WE'LL GET OUR MIRACLE.
I MEAN, SHE'S GONNA WAKE UP.

01:55.166 --> 01:57.834
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU HAVE TO BE SO NEGATIVE.
EDDIE--

01:57.875 --> 02:00.000
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BELIEVE?

02:01.917 --> 02:04.166
I'M SORRY.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.959
IT'S JUST, UH...

02:09.041 --> 02:11.333
I UNPLUGGED
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,

02:11.375 --> 02:13.041
AND SHE DIDN'T DIE.

02:13.083 --> 02:15.542
SHE DIDN'T DIE.

02:15.583 --> 02:18.000
THAT'S GOTTA MEAN SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW? AND...

02:18.041 --> 02:21.083
I'M DR. GINSBERG.
THIS IS MY TEAM.

02:21.125 --> 02:22.917
WHICH ONE ARE YOU?
OH. HELLO.

02:22.959 --> 02:25.458
DR. MONTGOMERY OR DR. KING?
DR. MONTGOMERY.
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.041
AND THIS IS EDDIE LINDY,
KAYLA'S HUSBAND.

02:28.083 --> 02:31.041
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING ALL THIS WAY.
I PREFER THAT FAMILY MEMBERS
WAIT OUTSIDE

02:31.083 --> 02:32.542
DURING THE DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS.

02:32.583 --> 02:34.834
DR. GINSBERG--
NO, NO, IT'S, UH,
THAT'S FINE.

02:34.875 --> 02:37.208
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

02:37.250 --> 02:40.709
OKAY, UH, PATIENT IS
KAYLA LINDY, 32 YEARS OF AGE,

02:40.750 --> 02:43.041
SURROGATE MOTHER
PREGNANT WITH TRIPLETS.

02:43.083 --> 02:44.583
DURING THE PREGNANCY,

02:44.625 --> 02:46.083
COMPLICATIONS LED TO
A PULMONARY--

02:46.125 --> 02:47.917
I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE FILE.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.083
ALL RIGHT.

02:49.125 --> 02:52.542
I'M GONNA NEED A COMPLETE EXAM
ALONG WITH A REPEAT E.E.G.,

02:52.583 --> 02:55.083
AN M.R.I. AND A CEREBRAL
BLOOD FLOW STUDY.

02:55.125 --> 02:57.333
COME ON. GO, PEOPLE. GO.
(doctors speak indistinctly)

02:57.375 --> 03:01.000
OH, SO NICE OF YOU
TO JOIN US, DR. SHEPHERD.

03:01.041 --> 03:03.000
I ASSUME YOU DIDN'T PLAN
ON MAKING A DECISION

03:03.041 --> 03:05.417
WITHOUT REVIEWING
THE RADIONUCLIDE CISTERNOGRAM.

03:05.458 --> 03:07.208
AMY?

03:07.250 --> 03:11.041
HEY... ADDIE.

03:11.083 --> 03:12.834
SO LONG TIME NO SEE.

03:12.875 --> 03:15.000
YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

03:15.041 --> 03:19.000
YES. UH, YES. I...
I WAS MARRIED TO HER BROTHER.

03:19.041 --> 03:20.208
(Ginsberg) AH.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.583
DON'T WORRY.

03:29.625 --> 03:32.041
GINSBERG IS A BEAST,
BUT SHE'S ALSO A GENIUS.

03:32.083 --> 03:34.458
AMY, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE COMING?

03:34.500 --> 03:36.458
WHAT,
AND SPOIL THE SURPRISE?

03:36.500 --> 03:39.458
YOU KNEW I WAS HERE?
YOUR NAME IS ALL OVER
KAYLA'S RECORDS.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.792
AMY--

03:40.834 --> 03:42.041
UH, AMELIA.

03:42.083 --> 03:46.041
DEREK IS THE ONLY ONE
WHO CALLS ME AMY THESE DAYS.

03:46.083 --> 03:48.041
AMELIA...
BUT DEREK DIDN'T TELL ME

03:48.083 --> 03:50.083
THAT YOU WERE
ONE OF GINSBERG'S FELLOWS.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.417
SHOCKER.

03:51.458 --> 03:53.417
DID HE, UH,
DID HE EVEN TELL YOU

03:53.458 --> 03:55.417
THAT I WENT
INTO NEUROSURGERY?

03:55.458 --> 03:57.875
IS THAT
THE GERALDINE GINSBERG?

03:57.917 --> 03:59.917
MY GOD.

03:59.959 --> 04:02.625
SAM BENNETT.
YOU STAYED HOT.

04:02.667 --> 04:04.041
AMELIA SHEPHERD?
(laughs)

04:04.083 --> 04:07.041
WELL, THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
YOU WERE, LIKE, 14 YEARS OLD.

04:07.083 --> 04:09.667
WHAT HAPPENED?
NOW SHE IS
A FANCY NEUROSURGEON.

04:09.709 --> 04:13.417
OH! THERE YOU ARE.
TAKE YOUR KID.
OH.

04:13.458 --> 04:15.458
NANNY WAS A NO-SHOW.
OH, WHAT IS IT?

04:15.500 --> 04:17.542
I HAVE TO GET TO THE OFFICE.
HE SPIT UP ON ME.

04:17.583 --> 04:20.083
OH.
I'M SENDING YOU
A DRY CLEANING BILL.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.083
OKAY, APPARENTLY THERE ARE
A LOT OF THINGS

04:22.125 --> 04:25.875
THAT DEREK DOES NOT SAY.
OH, NO, NO, NO.
HE'S--HE'S NOT MINE.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.083
HE'S, UH,
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND'S SON.

04:28.125 --> 04:29.542
DR. SHEPHERD.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.750
UH, DUTY CALLS.
WE WILL TALK LATER.

04:31.792 --> 04:33.500
I MISSED YOU GUYS.

04:33.542 --> 04:35.333
(Sam) SEE YOU LATER.

04:35.375 --> 04:38.041
HURRICANE AMELIA
MADE GOOD.

04:38.083 --> 04:40.041
WHAT KIND OF FAMILY IS IT

04:40.083 --> 04:42.542
WHERE THE BLACK SHEEP
ENDS UP BEING A NEUROSURGEON?

04:42.583 --> 04:44.083
(babbles)
WOW.

04:44.125 --> 04:46.083
HUH? OH, WHAT? HUH?
HOW YOU DOING, BUDDY?

04:46.125 --> 04:48.125
ARE YOU GONNA BE
A DOCTOR, TOO?

04:48.166 --> 04:50.125
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT? HUH?
(laughs)

04:50.166 --> 04:53.125
YEAH, THAT'S SAM.
THAT'S SAM. I THINK YOU ARE.
YOU'RE SO GOOD WITH HIM.

04:53.166 --> 04:56.125
THANK YOU. LISTEN, I GOTTA
GET HIM BACK TO THE NANNY.

04:56.166 --> 04:59.125
CAN YOU, UM, TELL GINSBERG
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK?
MM-HMM. YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

04:59.166 --> 05:01.125
(babbles)
SAY BYE-BYE. SAY BYE-BYE.

05:01.166 --> 05:02.583
SEE YOU LATER, BUDDY?

05:02.625 --> 05:05.000
BYE. SAY BYE-BYE. BYE.
OKAY.

05:05.041 --> 05:07.125
(sighs)

05:11.291 --> 05:14.667
(sighs)
IF SHE CAN HELP HER...

05:14.709 --> 05:16.667
I KNOW IT'S ASKING A LOT.

05:16.709 --> 05:20.291
BUT... ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE,
RIGHT?

05:20.333 --> 05:22.333
WAIT. YOU KNOW
THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT?

05:22.375 --> 05:24.041
(inhales deeply)

05:24.083 --> 05:25.375
LOOK. HEY, LOOK AT ME.

05:25.417 --> 05:26.625
(groans)

05:26.667 --> 05:28.834
LOOK AT ME.

05:28.875 --> 05:31.000
THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

05:35.083 --> 05:36.333
IT IS.

05:36.375 --> 05:39.166
BUT THANK YOU
FOR SAYING IT ISN'T.

05:45.083 --> 05:48.041
(elevator bell dings)

05:48.083 --> 05:50.333
OH, CHARLOTTE. GOOD.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.333
I-I CAN'T DO
THE SEX ED SEMINAR

05:52.375 --> 05:55.125
AT THE RETIREMENT HOME
TONIGHT.
YOU ARE NOT BAILING ON ME?

05:55.166 --> 05:57.125
UH, WELL, NOT BY CHOICE.

05:57.166 --> 05:59.333
I HAVE A PATIENT.
WE'RE DOING AN INTERVENTION.

05:59.375 --> 06:03.041
IT'S A THING.
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY.
GREAT. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
ABOUT THE MALE POINT OF VIEW?

06:03.083 --> 06:05.041
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I HAVE A PITCH FOR THAT.

06:05.083 --> 06:07.417
YOU KNOW, UH,
WHAT ABOUT COOPER?

06:09.208 --> 06:11.166
NO.

06:11.208 --> 06:13.208
HE'S GREAT WITH PEOPLE.

06:13.250 --> 06:16.208
HE'S GREAT
WITH 5 YEAR OLDS.
COME ON, CHARLOTTE.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.208
YOU'VE BEEN SITTING ON
YOUR HANDS FOR A MONTH NOW.

06:18.250 --> 06:20.208
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
TO WIN HIM BACK

06:20.250 --> 06:23.208
IF YOU DON'T JUST
REACH OUT THERE?
WHO SAID I WANTED
TO WIN HIM BACK?

06:23.250 --> 06:26.125
YOU ARE NEVER GONNA HAVE
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT

06:26.166 --> 06:29.166
IF YOU DON'T PUT YOURSELF
OUT THERE AND GO FOR IT.

06:29.208 --> 06:31.709
YOU REALLY DO
GIVE CRAPPY ADVICE.

06:31.750 --> 06:35.333
NO, ACTUALLY,
I'M KINDA... BRILLIANT.

06:36.834 --> 06:37.917
(laughs)

06:40.959 --> 06:43.041
APPLICATION
FOR THE FDA APPROVAL

06:43.083 --> 06:45.041
FOR THE NEXT STAGE
OF MY A.L.S. STUDY.

06:45.083 --> 06:47.709
NAOMI USUALLY REVIEWS THE DATA
BEFORE WE SUBMIT IT,

06:47.750 --> 06:50.041
BUT WITH HER GONE
AND LEAVING YOU IN CHARGE,

06:50.083 --> 06:51.834
IT'S YOUR JOB NOW.

06:51.875 --> 06:54.208
OH, THANKS.
LOOKS LIKE A FUN READ.

06:54.250 --> 06:56.208
BEING IN CHARGE
IS NOT MY IDEA OF FUN.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.000
I MEAN, I'M GLAD

06:58.041 --> 07:00.041
THAT WILLIAM FINALLY TOLD HER
ABOUT HIS A.L.S.,

07:00.083 --> 07:01.875
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW

07:01.917 --> 07:04.542
SHE WAS GONNA RUN OFF
TO SWITZERLAND TO BE WITH HIM.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.667
ANY WORD FROM THEM?

07:06.709 --> 07:08.667
I HEARD FROM NAOMI
A FEW DAYS AGO.

07:08.709 --> 07:11.125
I GUESS HE HASN'T SEEN
ANY IMPROVEMENT.

07:11.166 --> 07:14.125
DID NAOMI SAY WHEN, UH,
THEY'RE PLANNING ON COMING BACK?
NO.

07:14.166 --> 07:17.125
THEN MOVE THAT
TO THE TOP OF THE PILE

07:17.166 --> 07:19.125
SO THEY HAVE A REASON TO.

07:19.166 --> 07:22.166
(motor whirring)

07:24.083 --> 07:26.041
COME ON, CHARLOTTE.
SEX ED FOR SENIORS?

07:26.083 --> 07:28.667
IT'S A LITTLE OUT OF
MY WHEELHOUSE, DON'T YOU THINK?

07:28.709 --> 07:31.542
ACTUALLY, THEY'RE NOT ALL THAT
DIFFERENT FROM HORNY TEENAGERS.

07:31.583 --> 07:33.959
THEY GOT TOO MUCH TIME
ON THEIR HANDS,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
MINIMAL SUPERVISION,
ALMOST ZERO REGARD

07:36.041 --> 07:38.542
FOR THE CONSEQUENCES
OF RECKLESS SEXUAL BEHAVIOR.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.667
GRANNIES GONE WILD.
IT'S A REAL PROBLEM, COOPER.

07:41.709 --> 07:44.583
S.T.D.s ARE SPREADING THROUGH
THE ELDER CARE COMMUNITY

07:44.625 --> 07:46.125
LIKE A BRUSH FIRE.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.583
THE WOMEN CAN'T GET PREGNANT.

07:47.625 --> 07:50.333
THE MEN ARE ALL HOPPED UP
ON P.D.E.5 INHIBITORS.

07:50.375 --> 07:52.041
EVERYBODY'S
SCREWING EVERYBODY ELSE.

07:52.083 --> 07:53.542
NOBODY'S TAKING
ANY PRECAUTIONS.

07:53.583 --> 07:56.875
AS MUCH FUN AS THAT SOUNDS,
IT'S OLD PEOPLE, CHARLOTTE.

07:56.917 --> 07:58.792
I'M A PEDIATRICIAN.

08:01.083 --> 08:03.000
I NEED A MAN.

08:05.125 --> 08:07.917
A MALE.

08:07.959 --> 08:09.041
OH.

08:09.083 --> 08:11.291
THE MALE RESIDENTS
ARE OFTEN UNCOMFORTABLE

08:11.333 --> 08:14.291
BROACHING SEXUAL MATTERS
WITH FEMALE MEDICAL STAFF.
WHY ME?

08:14.333 --> 08:16.959
I'M COMING TO YOU
AS A PHYSICIAN,

08:17.000 --> 08:18.959
A FELLOW PARTNER
OF THIS MEDICAL PRACTICE.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.542
PUT AWAY YOUR FEAR
OF AGE SPOTS. HELP ME OUT.

08:26.125 --> 08:29.000
KAYLA'S REPEAT E.E.G.
SHOWS DIFFUSE SLOWING

08:29.041 --> 08:32.000
CONSISTENT WITH
A PERMANENT VEGETATIVE STATE.

08:32.041 --> 08:33.333
SURGERY WON'T HELP.

08:33.375 --> 08:36.041
KAYLA IS NOT
A VIABLE CANDIDATE.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.333
I'M SORRY, EDDIE.

08:37.375 --> 08:40.333
THERE MUST--MUST BE SOMETHING
ELSE YOU CAN AT LEAST TRY.

08:40.375 --> 08:42.333
SHE CAN'T JUST...
STAY LIKE THIS.

08:42.375 --> 08:44.542
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T HELP.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.625
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

08:46.667 --> 08:48.834
WHAT ABOUT CANNULATING
THE AQUEDUCT OF SYLVIUS?

08:48.875 --> 08:52.875
PASSING A STENT
TO DRAIN THE FLUID BUILDUP?
DR. SHEPHERD.

08:52.917 --> 08:54.875
HER C.S.F. STUDIES SHOW
A SLOWING OF FLOW,

08:54.917 --> 08:56.959
NOT A COMPLETE OBSTRUCTION.
IT COULD WORK.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.583
YOU KNOW HOW TO WAKE HER?
NO, SHE DOESN'T.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.208
SHE'S REFERRING TO
AN EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

09:01.250 --> 09:03.208
THAT HAS SHOWN
VERY LITTLE SUCCESS,

09:03.250 --> 09:05.375
AND IN YOUR WIFE'S CASE,
IT WILL NOT WORK.
I ASSISTED
IN TWO OF THE PROCEDURES...

09:05.417 --> 09:08.125
NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO BRING IT UP.
SO DO IT OR DON'T, BUT DON'T
SAY THAT IT CAN'T WORK.

09:08.166 --> 09:11.000
(Addison) AMELIA--
THIS PROCEDURE
IS A BAD IDEA.

09:11.041 --> 09:12.792
(Eddie) IF SHE THINKS THAT
IT CAN WORK, THEN WE SH--
SHE IS A TEACHING FELLOW WHO IS
NOT QUALIFIED TO MAKE THIS CALL.

09:12.834 --> 09:14.792
I GRADUATED TOP OF MY CLASS
AT HARVARD.

09:14.834 --> 09:17.041
I DID MY RESIDENCY
AT JOHNS HOPKINS.

09:17.083 --> 09:20.041
I HAVE DONE DOZENS OF PROCEDURES
IN THE THIRD VENTRICLE.

09:20.083 --> 09:26.417
I AM MORE THAN QUALIFIED.
THAT'S WHY YOU HIRED ME.
WELL, CLEARLY I MADE A MISTAKE.
YOU'RE FIRED, DR. SHEPHERD.

09:30.458 --> 09:32.625
AND IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING

09:32.667 --> 09:35.709
THAT JUST BECAUSE THE RISK
OF PREGNANCY IS GONE,

09:35.750 --> 09:38.208
THE RISK OF CONTRACTING SEXUALLY
TRANSMITTED DISEASES ISN'T.

09:38.250 --> 09:40.208
IN FACT,
IN A PLACE OF THIS SIZE,

09:40.250 --> 09:42.583
WHERE MANY OF YOU ARE SO...

09:42.625 --> 09:47.041
(clock ticking)

09:47.083 --> 09:51.041
SO LUCKY TO BE ENJOYING
CONSIDERABLE LEISURE TIME...

09:51.083 --> 09:52.417
UH, E-EXACTLY.

09:52.458 --> 09:53.667
YEAH.

09:53.709 --> 09:55.333
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS,

09:55.375 --> 09:57.917
TRANSMISSION RATES CAN BE
VERY HIGH, WHICH IS WHY,

09:57.959 --> 10:00.041
IF YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE INTERCOURSE,

10:00.083 --> 10:03.041
WE'D LIKE TO URGE YOU TO
FLASH BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL

10:03.083 --> 10:05.291
AND START
USING CONDOMS AGAIN.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.458
(woman scoffs)

10:07.500 --> 10:09.667
(ticking continues)

10:09.709 --> 10:12.667
ALTERNATIVELY, UM...

10:12.709 --> 10:16.083
THERE--THERE ARE MANY WAYS
TO BE INTIMATE AND SAFE

10:16.125 --> 10:19.041
SHORT OF--
OF ACTUAL PENETRATION.

10:19.083 --> 10:21.500
CAN ANYONE NAME A WAY
TO GET PLEASURE

10:21.542 --> 10:23.667
WITHOUT PENETRATION?

10:23.709 --> 10:25.041
(woman clears throat)

10:25.083 --> 10:27.083
(person coughs)

10:31.083 --> 10:34.000
I JUST FEEL SO AWFUL
FOR THE HUSBAND.

10:34.041 --> 10:36.000
YOU KNOW,
HE'S--HE'S GONNA HAVE TO

10:36.041 --> 10:38.750
WATCH HER WITHER AWAY
HOOKED UP TO A FEEDING TUBE

10:38.792 --> 10:40.792
WHEN IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE THAT WAY.

10:40.834 --> 10:44.125
IT'S A CRIME. I MEAN, IT'S
A CRIME OF MEDICAL OMISSION.

10:44.166 --> 10:46.458
IN FAIRNESS, EVEN DEREK SAID
THAT THIS ISN'T DOABLE.

10:46.500 --> 10:49.458
I E-MAILED THE SCANS,
AND HE SAID IT'S A NO GO.
DEREK IS JUST LIKE GINSBERG.

10:49.500 --> 10:53.333
I MEAN, IF HE HASN'T SEEN IT,
IT AIN'T SO. THIS IS JUST NEW.

10:53.375 --> 10:55.792
THIS IS A CUTTING-EDGE
SURGICAL PROCEDURE.

10:55.834 --> 10:57.959
THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN
DID A STUDY

10:58.000 --> 11:00.041
ON A SERIES OF 11 PATIENTS.

11:00.083 --> 11:02.959
I'VE SEEN IT.
I MEAN, I COULD DO IT.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.333
(sets glass on table)

11:05.375 --> 11:08.041
I'M JUST SAYING...
I TRAINED FOR IT.

11:08.083 --> 11:09.500
YOU DO REALIZE

11:09.542 --> 11:12.333
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A WOMAN
WITH THREE BABIES INSIDE HER?

11:12.375 --> 11:15.041
AND YOU REALIZE THAT KAYLA HAS
A HUSBAND AND TWO CHILDREN?

11:15.083 --> 11:17.041
ADDIE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:17.083 --> 11:18.750
I TH--
(Lucas crying)

11:18.792 --> 11:21.041
OH. COULD WE PAUSE
FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.041
HERE. I'LL GET IT.
I'LL GET HIM.
YEAH?

11:23.083 --> 11:24.375
YEAH.

11:29.083 --> 11:33.333
I SHOULD GET OUTTA HERE
AND GO PICK UP VANESSA.

11:33.375 --> 11:34.834
(Amelia) VANESSA?

11:34.875 --> 11:37.583
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

11:37.625 --> 11:39.041
YEAH. (chuckles)
THANK YOU.

11:39.083 --> 11:41.625
UH, ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.500
SEE YOU.
HAVE FUN. HAVE FUN.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.041
(sighs)

11:47.083 --> 11:49.792
OKAY, SO YOU AND SAM...

11:49.834 --> 11:51.583
WHAT IS WITH THE TENSION?

11:51.625 --> 11:53.750
THERE'S NO TENSION.
I WAS SITTING RIGHT HERE.

11:53.792 --> 11:57.000
I MEAN,
YOU BARELY LOOKED AT HIM.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.000
THERE WAS A THING.

12:03.041 --> 12:05.458
WITH YOU AND SAM?
WITH ME AND SAM.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.458
AND NAOMI DID NOT
TAKE IT WELL.

12:07.500 --> 12:10.458
AND NOW I'M WITH PETE, AND SAM
IS WITH VANESSA, AND IT'S FINE.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.041
IT'S VERY ADULT.
SOUNDS VERY MESSY.

12:13.083 --> 12:15.458
NO, IT'S NOT, ACTUALLY.
IT'S GREAT.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.500
MY LIFE IS WORKING.

12:17.542 --> 12:19.000
ADDISON.

12:19.041 --> 12:20.709
(glass clatters on table)

12:20.750 --> 12:23.208
I MEAN, THIS IS ME
YOU'RE TALKING TO.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.917
I CAUGHT YOU WITH
MY BROTHER'S BEST FRIEND

12:25.959 --> 12:27.667
AND I KEPT YOUR SECRET.

12:27.709 --> 12:29.667
I MEAN, YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

12:29.709 --> 12:33.000
YOU USED TO TRUST ME.

12:33.041 --> 12:34.667
I CHOSE PETE.

12:34.709 --> 12:37.041
I CHOOSE PETE.
HE'S GREAT. WE'RE GREAT.

12:37.083 --> 12:40.041
AND... I CAN'T HAVE KIDS,

12:40.083 --> 12:42.500
AND PETE HAS LUCAS.

12:42.542 --> 12:44.709
SO THAT'S SORT OF THIS...

12:44.750 --> 12:46.709
AMAZING ICING ON THE CAKE.

12:46.750 --> 12:48.250
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT...

12:48.291 --> 12:50.500
PETE'S STILL IN LOVE
WITH LUCAS' MOTHER,

12:50.542 --> 12:53.041
WHICH IS...

12:53.083 --> 12:57.041
OH, ADDIE.

12:57.083 --> 13:00.208
SO ANYWAY... CHEERS.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.333
(clink)

13:05.875 --> 13:07.250
I MISSED YOU.

13:09.375 --> 13:11.750
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE ALWAYS
A BETTER SISTER

13:11.792 --> 13:13.375
THAN THE ONES I HAD.

13:13.417 --> 13:16.458
AND YOU WERE WAY BETTER
THAN MY BROTHER.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.750
ARE THINGS OKAY
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

13:18.792 --> 13:22.166
HE'S THE GOLDEN CHILD.
(clears throat)

13:22.208 --> 13:24.500
EVERYTHING'S ALWAYS OKAY
WITH HIM.

13:27.375 --> 13:29.959
THAT WAS PAINFUL.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.959
AT LEAST THEY TOOK
SOME CONDOMS.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
AH, DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
OR--OR WANT SOME MORE CONDOMS?

13:35.041 --> 13:37.959
ACTUALLY,
I DO HAVE A QUESTION

13:38.000 --> 13:40.333
FOR THE GENTLEMAN,
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

13:40.375 --> 13:42.041
THE GENTLEMAN.

13:42.083 --> 13:44.125
OF COURSE.

13:44.166 --> 13:46.208
I'LL BE WAITING.

13:50.750 --> 13:52.000
HELLO.

13:56.083 --> 13:59.041
HOW C--HOW CAN I... HELP?

13:59.083 --> 14:01.333
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
HOW TO SAY THIS.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.333
UH, IT'S SOMEWHAT
EMBARRASSING.

14:03.375 --> 14:06.625
NO, I'M--I'M--I'M A DOCTOR.
I'VE HEARD IT ALL.

14:06.667 --> 14:08.041
(whispers) COME...

14:08.083 --> 14:09.125
OKAY.

14:09.166 --> 14:12.750
WELL... NORA AND I...

14:12.792 --> 14:15.083
WE'VE BEEN DATING
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.

14:15.125 --> 14:18.458
SHE'S A REALLY LOVELY WOMAN,
REALLY LOVELY.

14:18.500 --> 14:22.041
AND OUR, UH, OUR INTIMATE TIME
HAS BEEN VERY GOOD

14:22.083 --> 14:25.041
EXCEPT LATELY, IT'S BEEN
DIFFICULT FOR ME TO--

14:25.083 --> 14:27.041
OH, YOU KNOW,
AS MEN GET OLDER,

14:27.083 --> 14:30.041
IT'S, UH, IT'S VERY COMMON
FOR THEM TO HAVE DIFFICULTY,

14:30.083 --> 14:33.041
AS YOU SAY, GETTING, UM...
TRYING TO--

14:33.083 --> 14:35.041
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.
OH.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.375
I'M STILL ABLE TO PERFORM.
OH, GOOD. GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

14:37.417 --> 14:40.375
IT'S JUST BECOME UNCOMFORTABLE.
MY PELVIS IS SORE.

14:40.417 --> 14:43.000
IT DOESN'T WANT TO MOVE
THE WAY IT USED TO.

14:43.041 --> 14:46.000
SO I DON'T FIND MYSELF
GETTING, UH, IN THE MOOD.

14:46.041 --> 14:47.041
OH.

14:47.083 --> 14:50.041
SO... I WAS HOPING
YOU WOULD HAVE SOME PILLS

14:50.083 --> 14:51.917
TO HELP WITH LIBIDO.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.166
GIVEN YOUR DISCOMFORT,

14:53.208 --> 14:55.166
I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE
A COMPLETE EXAM

14:55.208 --> 14:57.291
BEFORE WE PRESCRIBE ANYTHING.

14:57.333 --> 15:00.500
AND YOU CAN DO THAT? I COULD
MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOU,

15:00.542 --> 15:03.083
AND YOU COULD CHECK ME OUT?
IT'S--IT'S MY ASSOCIATE'S
SPECIALTY NOT MINE.

15:03.125 --> 15:06.166
BUT I CAN BRING HER UP TO SPEED
ON EVERYTHING WE TALKED ABOUT.

15:06.208 --> 15:07.917
BUT YOU REALLY--

15:07.959 --> 15:10.917
YOU REALLY SHOULD MAKE
AN AP-APPOINTMENT TO SEE HER.

15:10.959 --> 15:14.041
WITH A LADY?

15:14.083 --> 15:16.083
SHE'S NO LADY.

15:20.542 --> 15:23.709
Y'ALL KEPT ME UP TILL
3:00 THIS MORNING.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.709
OH, OH, GOD. I'M SORRY.
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.709
SORRY, SAM.
I'M GLAD SHE'S HERE.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.208
I--ME, TOO. IT'S NICE.

15:29.250 --> 15:34.041
I FORGOT... HOW MUCH I LIKE
HAVING SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

15:34.083 --> 15:37.041
(chuckles)

15:37.083 --> 15:38.834
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

15:38.875 --> 15:41.083
NO, I CAN'T.

15:41.125 --> 15:42.041
IT--

15:42.083 --> 15:43.959
SAM, I CAN'T.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.458
I KNOW. OH, BOY.

15:49.083 --> 15:50.750
AMELIA?

15:50.792 --> 15:54.041
UH, EDDIE WANTED TO HEAR
MORE ABOUT THE SURGERY.

15:54.083 --> 15:57.041
SO WE STARTED TALKING,
AND ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER,

15:57.083 --> 15:59.125
AND, UH...

15:59.166 --> 16:01.750
AND WHAT?

16:01.792 --> 16:04.125
AND HE ASKED ME
TO DO THE SURGERY.

16:04.166 --> 16:06.041
AND I SAID YES.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.709
I CAN DO THE SURGERY
AND SAVE THE BABIES.

16:13.750 --> 16:16.333
I JUST NEED YOU IN THERE
TO KEEP AN EYE ON THEM

16:16.375 --> 16:18.583
AND SAM TO MAINTAIN
THE CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION.

16:18.625 --> 16:20.041
THIS CAN WORK.
IT'S RECKLESS.

16:20.083 --> 16:22.041
HOW--WELL, HOW--
HOW WOULD THIS WORK?

16:22.083 --> 16:25.333
JUST FOR EDDIE'S SAKE, I WANT
TO KNOW HOW THIS WOULD WORK.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.333
MM-HMM. I WOULD RELIEVE
THE OBSTRUCTION

16:27.375 --> 16:29.041
BY PLACING A STENT
IN THE AQUEDUCT,

16:29.083 --> 16:31.041
AND THEN
AS THE PRESSURE DROPS,

16:31.083 --> 16:33.291
THE ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN STEM
WILL RETURN,

16:33.333 --> 16:36.041
AND KAYLA WAKES UP.
AND IF IT WORKS,
WHAT STATE WILL SHE BE IN?

16:36.083 --> 16:38.041
WILL SHE
BE ABLE TO FUNCTION?

16:38.083 --> 16:41.041
I DON'T KNOW. BUT IF WE DON'T
DO IT, WE WILL NEVER KNOW.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.959
I'M AGAINST THIS.
I AM, TOO.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.959
TWO NEUROSURGEONS SAID NO
TO THIS, ONE BEING YOUR MENTOR,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.709
THE OTHER BEING YOUR BROTHER.
DEREK LOOKED AT AN E-MAIL
OF A SCAN.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.709
I MEAN, HE--HE DIDN'T EVEN
SEE THE PATIENT,

16:51.750 --> 16:53.208
WHICH ULTIMATELY
DOESN'T MATTER,

16:53.250 --> 16:55.834
BECAUSE EDDIE LINDY MADE
A DECISION TO SAVE HIS WIFE.

16:55.875 --> 16:58.500
HE ASKED ME TO DO IT,
AND I CAN DO IT.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.625
NOW WILL YOU GIVE ME
PRIVILEGES HERE?

17:02.166 --> 17:03.417
YES.

17:03.458 --> 17:05.792
(Addison) GREAT.

17:05.834 --> 17:07.875
I'LL GET YOU AN O.R.
FOR TOMORROW.

17:10.041 --> 17:13.000
ADDISON, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO TO STOP HER?

17:13.041 --> 17:15.208
NOTHING.
LOOK, I WAS WRONG.
I MADE A BAD CALL.

17:15.250 --> 17:18.208
YEAH, WELL... (chuckles)
I ADMIT THAT. BUT WE'RE BOTH
ON THE SAME SIDE WITH THIS.

17:18.250 --> 17:21.208
WE BOTH WANT TO GIVE
THOSE BABIES A CHANCE.
WHAT, DO YOU REALLY THINK
I CAN TALK HER OUT OF IT?

17:21.250 --> 17:24.208
I COULDN'T TALK YOU OUT OF IT.
I THINK YOU COULD TRY. I THINK
YOU COULD TRY TALKING TO HER.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.208
EDDIE WANTS THIS,
AMELIA IS SET,

17:26.250 --> 17:29.208
AND SHE JUST GOT SANCTIONED
BY THE CHIEF OF STAFF.

17:29.250 --> 17:32.583
YOU KNOW HER. YOU KNOW
THIS IS WRONG. SO STOP HER.

17:32.625 --> 17:34.041
(motor whirring)

17:34.083 --> 17:36.041
HAVE YOU REVIEWED
THE APPLICATION?

17:36.083 --> 17:38.875
NOT YET.
OVERNIGHT IT TO NAOMI.

17:38.917 --> 17:41.041
REALLY? YOU DON'T THINK
SHE HAS ENOUGH ON HER PLATE?

17:41.083 --> 17:44.083
WHY ARE YOU
ROLLING AROUND HERE

17:44.125 --> 17:46.041
WITH THIS GIGANTIC CHIP
ON YOUR SHOULDER?

17:46.083 --> 17:48.041
YOU SHOULD'VE NEVER TOLD ME
ABOUT WILLIAM'S A.L.S.

17:48.083 --> 17:49.458
YOU KNOW, I-I GET IT.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.917
YOU'RE UPSET THAT YOUR STUDY
ISN'T GOING FAST ENOUGH.

17:51.959 --> 17:54.709
I'LL READ THE APPLICATION,
I'LL GET--

17:54.750 --> 17:56.834
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
THE DAMN APPLICATION.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.041
I SLEPT WITH NAOMI.

17:59.083 --> 18:03.834
AND... THEN I TOLD HER
ABOUT WILLIAM.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.041
Y--

18:05.083 --> 18:06.500
YEAH, YEAH.

18:06.542 --> 18:08.041
YOU TOLD NAOMI...

18:08.083 --> 18:11.041
(lowered voice)
THAT WILLIAM HAS A.L.S.?

18:11.083 --> 18:14.083
WHY?

18:14.125 --> 18:16.500
I DON'T KNOW.

18:16.542 --> 18:18.959
(chuckles)
I WANTED MORE FROM HER,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.959
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO

18:22.000 --> 18:24.500
OR THAT SHE'D BE PISSED AT HIM
FOR WITHHOLDING.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.875
I DON'T KNOW.

18:26.917 --> 18:28.917
DOESN'T MATTER.

18:28.959 --> 18:30.458
SHE'S GONE.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.667
(motor whirring)

18:35.500 --> 18:40.041
PROSTATE CANCER?

18:40.083 --> 18:44.041
I CAME IN FOR LOSS OF LIBIDO,
PAIN FROM ARTHRITIS.

18:44.083 --> 18:46.041
(Charlotte) DISCOVERY
OF PROSTATE CANCER

18:46.083 --> 18:48.041
IS OFTEN
AN INCIDENTAL FINDING.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.041
YOU DON'T FIND IT
IF YOU DON'T LOOK,

18:50.083 --> 18:52.041
AND THEN IT'S TOO LATE.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.125
WHAT IS THE TREATMENT?

18:54.166 --> 18:57.041
IN YOUR CASE, I RECOMMEND
RADIATION THERAPY--

18:57.083 --> 18:58.583
EITHER EXTERNAL

18:58.625 --> 19:01.875
OR WITH AN IMPLANTABLE
RADIOACTIVE SEED.

19:01.917 --> 19:05.041
WHAT ABOUT...

19:05.083 --> 19:07.083
WHAT ABOUT MY JOHNSON?

19:07.125 --> 19:09.500
WILL IT STILL WORK AFTER?

19:09.542 --> 19:11.500
ABOUT HALF OF ALL PATIENTS

19:11.542 --> 19:13.542
DO EXPERIENCE
ERECTILE DIFFICULTY

19:13.583 --> 19:17.125
FOLLOWING RADIATION.
AND THERE ARE NO
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS?

19:17.166 --> 19:19.583
WELL, GIVEN YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES,
NOT THAT I RECOMMEND.

19:19.625 --> 19:22.125
BUT THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO
IF IMPOTENCE OCCURS

19:22.166 --> 19:24.959
AS A SIDE EFFECT
OF THE RADIATION--

19:25.000 --> 19:26.166
INJECTIONS, PUMPS--

19:26.208 --> 19:29.125
IF I DON'T HAVE
THE TREATMENT...

19:29.166 --> 19:31.166
HOW LONG DO I HAVE?

19:33.083 --> 19:36.000
FOUR, MAYBE FIVE YEARS.

19:41.083 --> 19:43.417
IT'S BEEN LOVELY
TALKING TO YOU.

19:43.458 --> 19:45.041
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

19:45.083 --> 19:49.083
MR. SCHMITT.

19:49.125 --> 19:50.667
(Cooper) HE'S A MAN,

19:50.709 --> 19:52.041
AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM
LOSING HIS MANHOOD.
I GET THAT.

19:52.083 --> 19:54.166
NO, YOU CAN'T. YOU'RE A WOMAN.
YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY KNOW

19:54.208 --> 19:56.166
HOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WOULD MAKE HIM FEEL.

19:56.208 --> 19:58.625
AND YOU'RE A MAN,
SO OF COURSE YOU DO.

19:58.667 --> 20:00.166
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

20:00.208 --> 20:03.166
I MEAN, IS THE GUY
EVEN MAKING THE WRONG DECISION?

20:03.208 --> 20:05.166
PROSTATE CANCER'S
PRETTY SLOW GROWING. HE'S 80.

20:05.208 --> 20:08.125
IF HE WANTS TO LIVE THE LIFE
HE HAS LEFT ON HIS OWN TERMS

20:08.166 --> 20:10.125
AND NOT HAVE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SEX,

20:10.166 --> 20:12.583
WHO ARE WE TO TELL HIM NO?
SO I SHOULD JUST LET HIM DIE?

20:12.625 --> 20:15.625
OH, COME ON.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.
HE'S IN
EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD HEALTH.

20:15.667 --> 20:18.041
AND THIS CANCER'S AGGRESSIVE.
HIS GLEASON LEVEL'S A 7.

20:18.083 --> 20:21.041
AND IF HE'S MADE IT TO 80,

20:21.083 --> 20:23.667
STATISTICALLY, HE'S GOT A GOOD
SHOT OF MAKING IT TO 100.

20:23.709 --> 20:25.709
NOW HE'S GOT A WOMAN
THAT HE LOVES--

20:25.750 --> 20:27.709
THAT HE WANTS TO BE ABLE
TO LOVE.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.709
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE
EMASCULATED, CHARLOTTE.

20:29.750 --> 20:32.041
IS IT SO HARD FOR YOU
TO SEE THAT?

20:32.083 --> 20:35.166
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT OSCAR
OR WE TALKING ABOUT YOU?

20:35.208 --> 20:37.000
EXCUSE ME?

20:37.041 --> 20:39.250
EMASCULATION SEEMS TO BE
YOUR CATCH PHRASE FOR ME.

20:39.291 --> 20:41.250
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT YOU,
BUT TRUTH?

20:41.291 --> 20:43.709
YEAH, YOU LIKE TO BE TOUGHER
THAN EVERYONE ELSE,

20:43.750 --> 20:46.917
AND THAT MAKES
SOME PEOPLE PULL AWAY.
I THOUGHT WE WERE PAST THIS.

20:46.959 --> 20:48.709
YOU BROUGHT IT UP.

20:48.750 --> 20:51.000
I CAME TO YOU FOR HELP.

20:51.041 --> 20:54.750
WELL, MAYBE THAT WASN'T
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.
CLEARLY.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.166
(knocks on door)

21:00.208 --> 21:01.917
DR. SHEPHERD.

21:01.959 --> 21:05.041
UH, THIS IS
ANGIE AND SIMON McCONNELL.

21:05.083 --> 21:07.125
THEY'RE THE PARENTS THAT
KAYLA'S SURROGATE FOR.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.041
THEY WANTED TO MEET YOU.

21:09.083 --> 21:12.041
WELL, I'D--I'D SHAKE
YOUR HANDS, BUT...

21:12.083 --> 21:14.875
DR. MONTGOMERY TOLD US
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

21:14.917 --> 21:16.875
EDDIE DOESN'T WANT
TO HEAR THIS,

21:16.917 --> 21:20.041
BUT OUR BABIES
ARE BARELY VIABLE.

21:20.083 --> 21:22.417
HE'S WELL AWARE.
WE KNOW
THIS IS HORRIBLE TO ASK

21:22.458 --> 21:25.917
AFTER ALL THAT KAYLA'S
BEEN THROUGH, BUT...

21:25.959 --> 21:28.500
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

21:28.542 --> 21:31.500
WE ARE SO CLOSE
TO HAVING OUR FAMILY.

21:33.083 --> 21:36.000
WOULD YOU TALK WITH ME
OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE?

21:42.166 --> 21:44.375
YOU THOUGHT IF I SAW THE PARENTS
WITH THEIR SAD FACES,

21:44.417 --> 21:45.959
WHAT, I WAS JUST
GONNA BACK DOWN?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.542
LOOK,
I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING.

21:47.583 --> 21:49.542
NOT FOR THE BABIES.
THE RISK IS TOO HIGH.

21:49.583 --> 21:51.542
THE ADDISON MONTGOMERY I KNOW
WOULD WADE THROUGH FIRE

21:51.583 --> 21:52.333
FOR A PATIENT.

21:52.375 --> 21:54.333
SHE WOULDN'T WHINE ABOUT
THE RISKS.

21:54.375 --> 21:55.583
I MEAN, SHE'D GO
ALL SUPER WOMAN ON ME

21:55.625 --> 21:57.333
TRYING TO CONVINCE ME
TO DO THE SURGERY.

21:57.375 --> 22:00.041
WHAT IS IT? WHAT, YOU'RE
SETTLING IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE,

22:00.083 --> 22:03.041
SO NOW YOU'RE WILLING TO SETTLE
WITH YOUR PATIENTS, TOO?
I AM NOT SETTLING, AMELIA.

22:03.083 --> 22:04.959
YOU HAVE FEELINGS
FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.041
PETE HAS FEELINGS
FOR HIS KID'S MOM.

22:07.083 --> 22:10.041
YOU SAY IT'S GREAT.
YOU DON'T SEEM GREAT.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

22:10.083 --> 22:15.083
YOU SEEM SAD, ADDISON.
AND YOU SHOULD BE.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.166
OKAY, WHAT--YOU ARE WAY
OUT OF LINE HERE.

22:17.208 --> 22:19.166
YOU SHOULD WANT MORE...

22:19.208 --> 22:23.458
MORE FOR YOURSELF
AND MORE FOR KAYLA.

22:25.417 --> 22:28.125
(door closes)

22:31.417 --> 22:33.208
I CAN'T DECIDE
IF IT'S WORSE

22:33.250 --> 22:35.208
IF SHE CHOOSES WILLIAM
AND HE DIES

22:35.250 --> 22:37.291
OR IF SHE CHOOSES ME
AND HE LIVES.

22:37.333 --> 22:39.792
YOU DON'T WANT HIM
TO DIE.
RIGHT, RIGHT.

22:39.834 --> 22:43.625
'CAUSE THEN I GOTTA COMPETE
WITH HIS GHOST.
YEAH, BUT HE LIVES, YOU GOTTA
COMPETE WITH ALL THAT MONEY.

22:43.667 --> 22:46.000
IT'S LOSE-LOSE EITHER WAY,
RIGHT?
YES, WHICH IS WHY
WE'RE HERE. MOVE ON.

22:46.041 --> 22:47.667

ALWAYS LOVE VIOLET.

29:01.542 --> 29:03.875
LET'S PREP THE BELLY.
I'M CUTTING HER OPEN.

29:03.917 --> 29:06.166
AMELIA, STEP BACK.
I CAN DO THIS, ADDISON.

29:06.208 --> 29:09.166
JUST GIVE SAM A CHANCE.
SO LONG AS THE BABIES
ARE IN THERE,

29:09.208 --> 29:10.834
SHE'S GONNA
KEEP THROWING CLOTS,

29:10.875 --> 29:12.458
AND THEY WILL NOT SURVIVE
THE PROCEDURE.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.041
I NEED
TO DELIVER THE BABIES NOW.

29:14.083 --> 29:20.875
AMELIA, STEP BACK.
SCALPEL.

29:25.583 --> 29:27.041
BABY NUMBER ONE.

29:27.083 --> 29:30.750
CALL NICU. GET THREE VENTS
AND A CENTRAL LINE SET UP.

29:30.792 --> 29:32.625
(woman speaks indistinctly)

29:32.667 --> 29:35.208
BABY NUMBER TWO. COME ON.

29:35.250 --> 29:36.542
(monitor beeping erratically)

29:36.583 --> 29:39.667
WHY WASN'T I PAGED?
I HAVE A FULL TEAM HERE.

29:39.709 --> 29:43.208
I'M AN ATTENDING ON THIS CASE.
YOU COULD'VE USED ME.

29:43.250 --> 29:45.250
NUMBER THREE.
SAM, YOU'RE CLEAR TO GO.

29:45.291 --> 29:47.709
SHE'S FLOPPY.
NO SPONTANEOUS RESPIRATION.

29:47.750 --> 29:49.041
I CAN'T FEEL A HEARTBEAT.

29:49.083 --> 29:52.500
LET ME ASSIST YOU.
I'VE GOT IT.
SET UP AN INTUBATION TRAY.

29:52.542 --> 29:55.000
LET ME HELP YOU.
WE ARE HERE
BECAUSE OF YOU.

29:55.041 --> 29:58.041
THIS BABY IS LIKE THIS
BECAUSE OF YOU.

29:58.083 --> 30:01.250
THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO
RIGHT NOW IS BACK OFF.

30:01.291 --> 30:03.250
GIVE ME AN E.T. TUBE.

30:03.291 --> 30:05.166
ALL RIGHT. SUCTION.
SHE'S ASPIRATED.

30:05.208 --> 30:07.166
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

30:07.208 --> 30:09.667
OKAY, I'M ALMOST THERE.
ALMOST THERE. GOT IT.

30:09.709 --> 30:13.250
OKAY. HOLD C.P.R.
(monitor beeping erratically)

30:13.291 --> 30:15.166
THERE'S NO PULSE.
RESUME C.P.R.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.583
OKAY.

30:17.625 --> 30:18.917
(air whooshes)

30:18.959 --> 30:20.792
(whoosh)

30:20.834 --> 30:21.792
(whoosh)

30:21.834 --> 30:23.041
COME ON.

30:23.083 --> 30:24.291
(whoosh)

30:24.333 --> 30:26.625
COME ON.

30:26.667 --> 30:28.834
COME ON, BABY.
HOLD ON.

30:28.875 --> 30:30.291
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

30:30.333 --> 30:33.041
GOOD. WE GOT A RHYTHM...
AND A PULSE.

30:33.083 --> 30:35.041
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET HER INTO NICU.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.583
CALL AN ECMO UNIT. THIS BABY
NEEDS TO BE ON BYPASS.

30:37.625 --> 30:41.291
HAVE THE TECHS MEET US
AT THE UNIT. LET'S GO.
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

30:41.333 --> 30:43.375
SAM, YOU GOT THIS?
YEAH.

30:43.417 --> 30:44.792
(monitor beeps erratically)

30:44.834 --> 30:47.125
(Oscar) APPARENTLY,
YOU'VE SPOKEN TO DR. KING.

30:47.166 --> 30:48.375
YES.

30:48.417 --> 30:49.834
I TOLD HER

30:49.875 --> 30:52.375
THAT YOU HAD THE RIGHT
TO REFUSE MEDICAL TREATMENT,

30:52.417 --> 30:54.375
WHICH IS TRUE.
THANK YOU.

30:54.417 --> 30:56.583
BUT I ALSO THINK
IT'S WRONG.

30:56.625 --> 30:58.041
IMPOTENCE IS NOT

30:58.083 --> 31:00.458
AN INEVITABLE SIDE EFFECT
OF RADIATION.

31:00.500 --> 31:03.375
SHE SAID I HAVE
A 50/50 CHANCE

31:03.417 --> 31:05.250
OF LOSING FUNCTION.

31:05.291 --> 31:08.166
AND IF YOU COME DOWN
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THAT,

31:08.208 --> 31:11.166
YOU STILL HAVE
A WOMAN THAT LOVES YOU.
BUT I WON'T BE ABLE
TO LOVE HER BACK.

31:11.208 --> 31:14.166
WELL, MAYBE NOT IN THE WAY
THAT YOU CAN NOW.

31:14.208 --> 31:16.166
BUT WITH THE HELP
OF DR. KING...

31:16.208 --> 31:17.959
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.667
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

31:20.709 --> 31:24.458
BUT THESE OPTIONS
THAT DR. KING MENTIONED,

31:24.500 --> 31:27.834
THEY DON'T HAVE TO...

31:27.875 --> 31:30.041
THEY DON'T MAKE YOU
LESS OF A MAN.

31:30.083 --> 31:33.625
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO GET OLD?

31:33.667 --> 31:35.834
PEOPLE START DOING THINGS
FOR YOU.

31:35.875 --> 31:39.792
THEY STOP LETTING YOU
DO THINGS FOR YOURSELF...

31:39.834 --> 31:42.041
LIKE WORK A JOB, UH,

31:42.083 --> 31:44.041
OR LIVE IN A HOUSE

31:44.083 --> 31:48.000
OR DRIVE YOUR OWN CAR
DOWN THE STREET.

31:48.041 --> 31:49.291
I LOST MY WIFE.

31:49.333 --> 31:52.041
MY KIDS
HAVE LIVES OF THEIR OWN.

31:52.083 --> 31:53.834
I'M STUCK HERE.

31:53.875 --> 31:58.041
BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT
I CAN STILL DO FOR MYSELF,

31:58.083 --> 32:01.083
ONE THING THAT MAKES ME
FEEL WHOLE.

32:01.125 --> 32:04.041
AND I'M NOT ABOUT
TO LET THAT BE TAKEN AWAY

32:04.083 --> 32:08.000
OR--OR HAVE IT MADE
UNCOMFORTABLE OR UNNATURAL.

32:11.083 --> 32:14.041
WELL, I ADMIT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GET OLD.

32:14.083 --> 32:17.834
AND WHEN IT COMES TO SEX,
I GET THAT.

32:17.875 --> 32:19.417
AND WHEN...

32:19.458 --> 32:21.917
YOU CAN'T DO IT...

32:21.959 --> 32:25.417
I MEAN, THAT IS...

32:25.458 --> 32:28.875
LOOK, IT HAPPENS.
IT HAPPENS TO EVERY GUY.

32:28.917 --> 32:31.041
I...

32:31.083 --> 32:33.041
I WAS WITH A WOMAN I LOVED,

32:33.083 --> 32:35.834
AND WE WERE FIGHTING A LOT,

32:35.875 --> 32:38.875
AND, UH... I WAS STRESSED OUT,

32:38.917 --> 32:44.000
AND THAT MADE IT
DIFFICULT... TO PERFORM.

32:46.083 --> 32:48.041
AND IT WAS HUMILIATING.

32:48.083 --> 32:50.041
OH... IT WAS.

32:50.083 --> 32:52.000
AND SO I PUSHED HER AWAY

32:52.041 --> 32:54.458
AND I TREATED HER BADLY

32:54.500 --> 32:57.458
BECAUSE I WAS FEELING LIKE
I WAS LESS OF A MAN.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.125
I WAS... I WAS WRONG.

32:59.166 --> 33:02.333
I WAS JUST WRONG.

33:02.375 --> 33:04.500
MR. SCHMITT,
I CAN'T PROMISE YOU

33:04.542 --> 33:06.500
THAT THERE'LL BE
NO SIDE EFFECTS

33:06.542 --> 33:08.500
IF YOU DO THIS TREATMENT.

33:08.542 --> 33:11.041
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT YOU'LL BE ALIVE

33:11.083 --> 33:15.041
AND YOU WILL GET TO CONTINUE
TO LOVE NORA

33:15.083 --> 33:18.041
FOR A LONG TIME TO COME.

33:18.083 --> 33:21.041
YOU WILL BE
THE MAN IN HER LIFE.

33:21.083 --> 33:23.750
AND THAT'S
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

33:31.083 --> 33:33.041
(monitor beeping erratically)

33:33.083 --> 33:34.166
SAM.

33:34.208 --> 33:38.041
ALMOST THERE. 30cc SYRINGE.

33:38.083 --> 33:41.166
(beeping continues)

33:41.208 --> 33:45.333
AND CLOTS ARE DISSOLVING.

33:45.375 --> 33:47.458
VITALS ARE STABILIZING.

33:47.500 --> 33:50.834
THE REST IS UP TO YOU,
DR. SHEPHERD.

33:50.875 --> 33:52.625
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

33:52.667 --> 33:55.041
I ALMOST KILLED HER, SAM.

33:55.083 --> 33:56.792
AND THOSE BABIES--

33:56.834 --> 33:59.875
THEY'RE IN ADDISON'S HANDS.

33:59.917 --> 34:02.417
(whispers)
WHAT AM I DOING?

34:02.458 --> 34:06.041
YOU'RE A DOING SURGERY
ON A WOMAN'S BRAIN...

34:06.083 --> 34:08.041
A-A SURGERY YOU SAID
ONLY YOU COULD DO...

34:08.083 --> 34:10.041
A SURGERY YOU FOUGHT FOR.

34:10.083 --> 34:12.333
STOP STANDING THERE AND START
ACTING LIKE A SURGEON.

34:12.375 --> 34:14.333
(normal voice)
YOU SOUND LIKE ADDISON.

34:14.375 --> 34:15.792
NO, I SOUND LIKE YOU

34:15.834 --> 34:18.125
BEFORE YOU STARTED
LOSING CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF.

34:18.166 --> 34:19.583
AMELIA, CAN YOU DO THIS?

34:19.625 --> 34:20.500
CAN YOU WAKE THIS WOMAN UP

34:20.542 --> 34:22.500
AND BRING HER BACK
TO HER FAMILY?

34:22.542 --> 34:25.417
OR WERE JUST SPOUTING
A BUNCH OF MESS

34:25.458 --> 34:27.458
BECAUSE YOU LIKE TO CUT?

34:27.500 --> 34:31.709
(exhales deeply)

34:31.750 --> 34:32.792
I CAN DO THIS.

34:32.834 --> 34:35.417
OKAY, THEN. GO.
WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.

34:35.458 --> 34:37.458

THE CATHETER FOR THE STENT.

MARGINALLY RESPONSIVE BY NOW.

34:55.083 --> 34:57.041
I FREAKED OUT, SAM.

34:57.083 --> 34:58.458
MAYBE I TOOK TOO LONG.

AND YOU DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.709
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

38:50.750 --> 38:53.208
(whispers, voice breaking)
IF YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH ADDISON,

38:53.250 --> 38:55.041
SAY IT.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.750
W--

38:56.792 --> 38:59.750
(sighs) IF I'M JUST
A PIT STOP, SAY IT.

38:59.792 --> 39:01.834
VANESSA, PLEASE--
(normal voice)
STOP WASTING MY TIME.

39:01.875 --> 39:03.750
ADDISON IS NOT
A FACTOR HERE.

39:03.792 --> 39:06.041
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

39:06.083 --> 39:08.333
(sighs)

39:08.375 --> 39:10.417
(whispers)
DO YOU LOVE HER?

39:10.458 --> 39:13.667
(babies continue crying)

39:16.083 --> 39:19.625
(voice breaks)
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

39:21.583 --> 39:24.583
(The Rescues' "Follow Me
Back Into the Sun" playing)

39:27.250 --> 39:30.208
HOW IS IT THAT A WOMAN
CAN BE WOKEN UP FROM THE DEAD

39:30.250 --> 39:34.041
AND I CAN'T EVEN BE FRIENDS
WITH COOPER?
ADDISON'S PATIENT WOKE UP?

39:34.083 --> 39:37.041
YEAH. CRAZY, RIGHT?
WELL, MAYBE YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING AFTER ALL.

39:37.083 --> 39:40.041
SEE, I-I TOLD YOU.
NO, I DID THE WRONG THING WITH
HER, AND IT TURNED OUT OKAY.

39:40.083 --> 39:42.041
I DID THE WRONG THING
WITH COOPER,

39:42.083 --> 39:45.250
AND IT TURNED OUT BADLY.
(sighs) STILL NO WORD
FROM YOUR PATIENT?

39:45.291 --> 39:47.875
THE OPPOSITE.
COOPER GOT HIM TO COME IN.

39:47.917 --> 39:50.583
HE AGREED TO DO TREATMENT.

39:50.625 --> 39:53.125
THEN HE WOULDN'T EVEN
HAVE A DRINK WITH ME.

39:53.166 --> 39:55.375
BUT YOU WORKED TOGETHER
WITH GOOD RESULTS. RIGHT?

39:55.417 --> 39:57.875
I MEAN, IT'S A START.

39:57.917 --> 40:00.667
STOP GETTING MY HOPES UP.

40:00.709 --> 40:05.417
HOW LONG DID THAT MAN WAIT
FOR HIS WIFE TO WAKE UP?

40:05.458 --> 40:07.583
(sighs)
AH, HE'LL COME AROUND.

40:07.625 --> 40:10.583
IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU COME HAVE A DRINK WITH ME.

40:10.625 --> 40:13.583
I MEAN, YOU AND COOPER
MIGHT NOT BE THERE YET,

40:13.625 --> 40:15.792
BUT YOU AND I
CAN STILL BE FRIENDS, RIGHT?

40:15.834 --> 40:17.583
(laughs) RIGHT?

40:17.625 --> 40:20.917
(laughs) YES.

40:20.959 --> 40:22.458
(babbles)

40:22.500 --> 40:24.625
AHH. MMM.

40:24.667 --> 40:26.583
HEY.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.208
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

40:28.250 --> 40:30.083
OH.

40:30.125 --> 40:32.041
THANK YOU...

40:32.083 --> 40:35.041
FOR LETTING ME
STAY HERE TONIGHT.

40:35.083 --> 40:37.834
AMELIA IS AT MY HOUSE,
AND I JUST...

40:37.875 --> 40:41.041
JUST WANTED IT TO BE...
US TONIGHT--

40:41.083 --> 40:45.041

AND LUCAS.

40:45.083 --> 40:46.625
THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

40:46.667 --> 40:48.041
HEY.

40:48.083 --> 40:49.625
YOU OKAY?

40:49.667 --> 40:51.041
YEAH. YEAH.

40:51.083 --> 40:52.625
HI, BABY.

40:52.667 --> 40:54.041
(babbles)

40:54.083 --> 40:55.667
OH. (laughs)

40:55.709 --> 40:58.083
KAYLA WOKE UP.
