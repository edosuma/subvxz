WEBVTT

00:06.840 --> 00:08.542
(birds chirping)

00:08.576 --> 00:09.577
Hi.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.491
(Dave humming)

00:23.524 --> 00:26.527
(instrumental music playing
over computer)

00:26.560 --> 00:28.562
Dave, we don't have time.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.498
(Dave vocalizing)

00:30.531 --> 00:32.700
(auto-tuned): * Slow down,
come be with me... *

00:32.733 --> 00:35.236
Okay, I've got everything
you need right here.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.437
(hums)

00:36.470 --> 00:38.005
* You're the best... *

00:38.038 --> 00:40.241
Dave, how much longer
are you gonna be doing this?

00:40.274 --> 00:42.743
* So long, I can't stop... *

00:42.776 --> 00:44.178
-Dave.
-Do it with me.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.214
I'm leaving.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.916
* Have it your way *

00:48.949 --> 00:51.785
* I know I'm late *

00:51.819 --> 00:55.089
-* But it's okay... *
-No.

00:55.123 --> 00:57.758
(auto-tuned): * We don't have
time to wait... * Oh.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.461
* We're gonna have
the best time... *

01:00.494 --> 01:02.130
-Dave, you have to change.
-(grunts)

01:02.163 --> 01:04.398
* Do you remember
when you got all mad *

01:04.432 --> 01:06.634
* 'Cause I threw out
that flyer? *

01:06.667 --> 01:10.271
That was not a flyer.
I told you.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.473
-* Yes, it was *
-(laughs)

01:12.506 --> 01:14.908
* No, it was a save the date *

01:14.942 --> 01:16.710
* It's the same thing,
it's gonna end up *

01:16.744 --> 01:18.912
* On a fridge either way... *

01:18.946 --> 01:20.548
-Fine.
-* This weekend *

01:20.581 --> 01:22.316
* You're gonna dance with me *

01:22.350 --> 01:25.219
* Yes, of course, I love you *

01:25.253 --> 01:28.088
* But we really got
to go right now *

01:28.122 --> 01:30.224
* Fine, it was fun
while it lasted. *

01:30.258 --> 01:32.460
Mm-hmm.
(chuckles)

01:39.267 --> 01:41.235
I got to export this.

01:41.269 --> 01:44.972
That was high art. Oh, my God.

01:45.005 --> 01:46.574
-Great work.
-(chuckles): Yeah.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.409
Okay. We got to go.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.911
-Can I use this on my album
as an interlude?
-Dave.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.913
-* Hi, I'm Dave *
-* I'm Lil Dicky *

01:52.946 --> 01:54.348
-* Hi, I'm Dave *
-* Who's Dave? *

01:54.382 --> 01:55.516
* Hi, I'm Dave. *

01:55.549 --> 01:57.017
ALLY:
"If there was one word

01:57.050 --> 01:59.787
I would use to describe
my big sister,

01:59.820 --> 02:02.590
-it would be 'hilarious.'"
-Hmm.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.193
"When I wanted to invite Anthony
Turner to my eighth grade dance,

02:05.226 --> 02:08.996
Julie was all,
'But, Ally, how will he dance?'"

02:09.029 --> 02:11.432
-(whispers): Why?
-Because Anthony Turner
had actually--

02:11.465 --> 02:13.033
He broke both
of his legs in, like,

02:13.066 --> 02:16.003
a really bad skiing accident.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.105
But I-I guess people don't--
Should I say that

02:18.138 --> 02:20.107
-at the beginning
or at the end of the joke?
-Wait a minute.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.643
I'm very-- Like, I thought you
were giving the speech, and now,

02:22.676 --> 02:24.178
like, you're talking
t-- I'm like, just--

02:24.212 --> 02:25.813
I don't know
when the fourth wall broke,

02:25.846 --> 02:27.681
when you started talking to me,
it's all very...

02:27.715 --> 02:29.383
I'm asking if you think
it's, if that's...

02:29.417 --> 02:31.151
-Oh.
-Well, that's like--
people are gonna laugh.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.787
You know, I don't know,
I wouldn't make fun of a kid

02:33.821 --> 02:36.357
for being crippled or whatever
you just spoke about.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.891
I don't know
how I'm expected to give, like,

02:37.925 --> 02:40.228
an even okay
maid of honor speech,

02:40.261 --> 02:42.863
when I have no idea
why I'm the maid of honor.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.299
Like, we-we're not even friends.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.335
Use that. Start with that--
that's raw.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.737
There's, like, emotion there.
There's, like, earnestness.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.473
There's a real, you know, zeal.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.476
No matter what I do,
my family's gonna judge it.

02:55.509 --> 02:59.146
-Hmm.
-You know both of my parents
are Libras? Both of them.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.148
Uh, I never understand why
people say "don't judge me."

03:01.181 --> 03:02.550
That-- I mean,
we human beings judge.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.318
That's, like,
our total predisposition.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.320
That's how we select.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.556
-Or-or not "select," but...
-(phone vibrating)

03:08.589 --> 03:12.393
Oh. Mike.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.528
-Hey, man.
-Hi, Mike.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.196
MIKE (over phone):
Yes, hi, Ally. Whatever.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.831
Dave, heads up.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.668
Uh, Jim Moreno
from Random Gem called, and, uh,

03:20.701 --> 03:25.072
he says they're gonna have a
deal memo by the end of the day.

03:25.105 --> 03:28.709
All right. Um, and that--
What does that mean?

03:28.742 --> 03:31.545
Like, you know, for real.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.547
Dude, it is a precontract,
right?

03:33.581 --> 03:35.082
It's establishing
a relationship with you

03:35.115 --> 03:37.718
as an artist without, you know,

03:37.751 --> 03:39.186
getting fully into a contract.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.188
I love it when you talk dirty.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.856
It's the best thing that's come
across our desk so far.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.892
-Oh, my gosh! Oh! (gasps)
-(thumping)

03:44.925 --> 03:47.227
What the f-- Uh...

03:47.261 --> 03:49.897
Hello?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.098
Whatever.

03:51.131 --> 03:54.302
ALLY:
Oh, my God.

03:54.335 --> 03:57.305
Oh, my God, Dave.
It's a little bunny.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.772
DAVE:
Man down.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.642
-Oh, my God.
-(chittering)

04:01.675 --> 04:04.144
Fuck! He's still alive.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.146
His little foot is twitching.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.148
Very sad.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.983
Dave.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.152
-What?
-We can't leave him.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.087
He's, u-uh, suffering.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.089
We got to, like,
call a vet or something, right?

04:16.123 --> 04:17.991
Do you think there's, like,
a vet nearby, or...?

04:18.025 --> 04:19.893
I don't know where vets are.
And, no.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.895
Like, vets don't apply
to vermin. This thing's wild.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.564
This is a free-range rabbit.
I mean...

04:23.597 --> 04:25.766
-Oh, my God.
-I don't think
you can call a vet

04:25.799 --> 04:27.901
when you don't have ownership of
the cr-- you know, the creature.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.738
He's in pain, Dave.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.806
He looks like he's--
Yeah, it looks...

04:32.840 --> 04:34.642
I think he's fucking dying.

04:34.675 --> 04:38.011
-Okay, well, we have to kill it.
-What?

04:38.045 --> 04:40.448
-It-It's suffering. It's, like,
slowly dying. What are you--
-You want me to...?

04:40.481 --> 04:42.816
-We got to put him out of
his misery. That's like...
-You want me to kill it?

04:42.850 --> 04:45.285
Like, uh, what do you want me
to do? Stomp its head?

04:45.319 --> 04:47.287
Smother-- Like,
I'm not gonna kill this thing.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.957
You-you got to get back in
the car and then run him over.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.126
Again? You want me to run it
over twice? I'm not Suge Knight.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.128
-Run him over, but directly.
-How is that better for him?

04:55.162 --> 04:57.431
Direct? Uh, he's fucking--
I nailed him. I mean...

04:57.465 --> 04:59.967
-No, you didn't!
Or else he'd be dead!
-I did.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.135
Put yourself in his shoes.
You want to be lying

05:02.169 --> 05:03.871
in the middle of the road,
bleeding, dying?

05:03.904 --> 05:06.106
This thing isn't wearing shoes,
Al! This is vermin.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.042
Dave! It's a living thing
and it's suffering.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.478
You have to kill it.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.745
(rabbit chittering)

05:14.415 --> 05:16.950
You have to cut
more this-this way.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.852
-Left?
-You have to go on my right.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.954
-Dave, you have to go more
right. You're not gonna...
-All right,

05:20.988 --> 05:22.723
I'm not a precision
fucking driver. Stop yelling.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.892
Dave, you just have to hit
the fucking bunny.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.960
-Uh...
-No.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.061
-(shouts) Dave!
-(rabbit squealing)

05:28.095 --> 05:30.864
You just got its ears! My God!

05:30.898 --> 05:32.666
It's screaming.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.402
Dave, just... do it again.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.804
Move out of the way.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.472
(rabbit squealing)

05:38.506 --> 05:41.709
(screaming)

05:41.742 --> 05:43.977
-(singing gibberish)
-* Suck it in, if you're
Rin Tin Tin or Anne Boleyn *

05:44.011 --> 05:45.846
* Make a desperate move,
or else you'll win *

05:45.879 --> 05:48.682
* And then begin to see
what you're doing to me *

05:48.716 --> 05:51.151
* This MTV is not for free,
it's so PC, it's killing me *

05:51.184 --> 05:54.321
* So desperately I sing
to thee of love, sure... *

05:54.354 --> 05:56.924
This is a great Airbnb. Wow.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.326
Here comes my stress headache.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.894
Why? It's gonna be fine.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.730
I'm gonna blow them away
like I always do.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.165
Yeah. Nothing blows
parents away like,

06:05.198 --> 06:08.035
"Here's my boyfriend.
He's an aspiring rapper."

06:08.068 --> 06:09.403
There they are.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.772
Please, look at this man.
Your dad wants to fuck me.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.273
-The weary travelers.
-DAVE: Hey!
-ALLY: Hi, Dad.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.008
-Well, you guys
made some great time.
-DEBBIE: H-Hey!

06:15.042 --> 06:17.678
-Ah.
-Yeah. Waze is very accurate.
-Yeah. Yeah.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.047
-TERRY/DAVE: Hey.
-Oh, Allison,
you're getting skinny again.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.015
-TERRY: Let me take that.
All right.
-Oh...

06:22.049 --> 06:23.884
-You hungry?
-No, not really. I...
-I'm starving.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.619
-Oh, well, come on in.
We'll get you something.
-Yeah. Hey.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.855
-Yeah, we have food.
You bet. Come on.
-Thank you. Thanks.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.723
-DEBBIE: How was your drive?
-DAVE: Easy.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.525
-A little bit
of an obstacle, but...
-What's up, man?

06:31.559 --> 06:33.360
-You here to help me out,
muscle man? Aw...
-ALLY: Jules!

06:33.393 --> 06:34.562
-Hi.
-ALLY: Oh, my God!

06:34.595 --> 06:36.096
-You look so pretty.
-Hi.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.632
Hi. Oh. Okay.
Um, I just lotioned my hands.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.267
I don't want to get it
on your little romper.

06:40.300 --> 06:43.370
Oh. Uh, that's why
you smell so nice. (chuckles)

06:43.403 --> 06:45.573
Oh, no, this is unscented.
That's just my natural smell.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.074
Oh...

06:47.107 --> 06:48.909
-Okay. Let's go. Come on.
-Do you have any Advil?

06:53.514 --> 06:55.649
Jules, you know just as well
as I do, that's such a straw man

06:55.683 --> 06:57.084
argument. The guy got four
consecutive life sentences.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.952
-What are you talking about?
-I completely disagree with you.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.988
-You know it's far more
nuanced than that.
-It's not.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.623
Yes, it is. It is.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.658
Let me ask you lawyers this
while I have you here.

07:04.692 --> 07:07.327
Why do they even give people
multiple life sentences?

07:07.360 --> 07:08.762
Is the government
really implying

07:08.796 --> 07:10.564
that reincarnation
is a possibility?

07:10.598 --> 07:12.800
That can't be right, because
then it's a total s-separation

07:12.833 --> 07:15.669
of church and state violation
by the government.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.838
N-Nobody's saying that,
and it's far more complicated.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.107
-More complicated?
-More complicated.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.743
-Than reincarnation?
-More complicated.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.245
-Hey, how's school going, Al?
-Really great.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.447
Uh, the kids just put on
a play about global warming

07:27.481 --> 07:28.816
-that went really well.
-Mm-hmm.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.183
It was great. I was there.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.819
And it was a really big
project for me.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.854
Mm, I'm surprised
they let you delve

07:33.887 --> 07:36.857
into such political topics.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.592
I mean, it's not
a-a political issue.

07:38.626 --> 07:42.195
It's, like, a... human issue.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.998
You ca-- It has pulp.
You can't...

07:45.032 --> 07:47.434
-What?
-Do you think you can
shake the pulp out of it?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.269
Isn't that-- The shake--
No? You can't?

07:49.302 --> 07:50.704
-I thought it disintegrates
if you shake it.
-No.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.372
-No.
-No.
-TERRY: So, Dave,

07:52.405 --> 07:54.808
last time you were here,
you were an ad man.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.476
-Ugh, the dog days.
Am I right, Terry?
-(chuckles): That's right.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.145
DEBBIE:
Oh, David, please tell me.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.013
How's this whole
"rap" thing going? Huh?

08:00.047 --> 08:01.849
You know what?
No need for quotes anymore.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.350
It's actually
completely legitimate

08:03.383 --> 08:06.219
and borderline
unbelievably successful.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.021
-NICK: No way.
-Yeah, no. It's, uh,
it's kind of absurd.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.723
Like, every single one
of my songs

08:09.757 --> 08:12.292
has millions and millions
of streams across platforms.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.328
-Really?
-Yeah. So many different labels
are courting me left and right,

08:15.362 --> 08:17.565
-trying to throw
so much money at me.
-Huh.

08:17.598 --> 08:20.400
I was just in the studio
last week with Justin Bieber.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.635
-What?
-TERRY: Wow.
-What?

08:21.669 --> 08:23.871
-Justin Bieber? Wow.
-Justin Bieber, yeah.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.573
-Oh, my goodness.
-It's not a huge deal,
but it's certainly something

08:25.606 --> 08:28.008
-that we should talk about.
-I'm so proud of you.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.743
You know what a good metaphor
is? I feel like, you know how

08:29.777 --> 08:31.178
when a snake sheds its skin

08:31.211 --> 08:32.846
and gets that fresh layer
of epidermis?

08:32.880 --> 08:34.147
That's where I'm at.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.348
I'm in that transitional phase.

08:35.382 --> 08:36.483
And I'm shedding
my skin and, like,

08:36.516 --> 08:39.386
this new layer of skin
has so much sheen.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.822
-TERRY: Sheen.
Like, yeah, shiny.
-Just gloss.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.356
-Oh, that's beautiful.
-JULIE: Well, Dave,

08:43.390 --> 08:45.893
you certainly have confidence.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.761
Oh, I know. If only he could
share some with Ally.

08:47.795 --> 08:50.397
-JULIE: I know.
-What does that mean?

08:50.430 --> 08:51.599
I just meant you have
so much potential.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.100
I wish sometimes you would...

08:53.133 --> 08:55.869
use it on some kids who might
remember you, that's all.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.506
I remember
my kindergarten teacher.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.908
And I love my job.

09:00.941 --> 09:04.544
I teach the future. Which...

09:04.578 --> 09:08.515
-Oh, yeah.
-...is a big deal, I--
in some people's minds.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.283
I don't remember
my kindergarten teacher, but,

09:10.317 --> 09:12.285
-uh, I do like my job, though.
-TERRY: So, Dave,

09:12.319 --> 09:15.388
are you diversifying
your revenue streams?

09:15.422 --> 09:17.791
Like, uh, like, that rapper--
the one that's, uh,

09:17.825 --> 09:19.893
part owner of the Nets. Um...

09:19.927 --> 09:21.061
-Jay-Z.
-Jay-Z.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.030
-Like Jay-Z?
-DEBBIE: Ooh. He's the one

09:23.063 --> 09:24.531
that's married to Beyoncé.
I love her.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.533
-She's so beautiful.
-DAVE: You know, I'm working

09:26.566 --> 09:28.201
-on a few different things.
-TERRY: Mm.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.137
-DAVE: I-I...
-I need water. Excuse me.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.872
I'm actually,
I'm-I'm trying to get in,

09:31.905 --> 09:33.641
like, the condiment space.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.308
-You know, different sauces.
-TERRY: Mm-hmm.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.911
-DAVE: Food goes in and out
of style. Sauce...
-He's so fun.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.647
He is fun.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.915
Hey, um, I wanted
to talk to you.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.117
Don't worry about giving Chloe
any money for my bachelorette,

09:44.151 --> 09:45.919
because honestly, you didn't
even get a chance to go.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.288
Oh, no, but I'm-I'm--
of course I'm still gonna help

09:48.321 --> 09:49.556
pay for it.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.158
No, I know, I know.
It's just...

09:51.191 --> 09:52.960
like, it-it wasn't cheap,

09:52.993 --> 09:55.262
so I don't want you
to get stressed out, or...

09:55.295 --> 09:57.264
No, but as a gift, I should...

09:57.297 --> 09:59.967
How about you get us something
off the registry?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.234
Something small.

10:01.268 --> 10:05.172
-Something small? Perfect.
-Okay. Great. Perfect.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.608
Oh, that's the one where
George Clooney's the fox, right?

10:08.642 --> 10:10.811
No-no-no.
Breaking Bad is a TV show.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.646
It's, like, about meth.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.248
-You're thinking of
Fantastic Mr. Fox...
-Yeah, that's right.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.684
David, you're not
gonna try my carrots?

10:16.717 --> 10:18.118
I got them
at the farmers market.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.120
No, that is a nonstarter
for Dave.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.856
He doesn't eat fruits
or vegetables.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.257
But I'll say this.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.759
I feel like you guys
are embracing me right now,

10:25.793 --> 10:27.995
-and I'm willing to try
my first carrot.
-NICK: Do it, man.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.930
I'll try the typical
orange Bugs Bunny one.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.265
-Why does it look like a witch?
-TERRY: Mmm.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.535
-It does.
-Do-do I take the tail off,
or you eat the tail?

10:35.568 --> 10:36.670
-Yeah, eat the whole thing.
-JULIE/NICK: Yeah.

10:36.704 --> 10:39.773
-Okay.
-TERRY: A little more.

10:39.807 --> 10:42.309
-(gags, coughs)
-TERRY: Yeah.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.145
It's good, right? Yeah?

10:45.178 --> 10:47.314
-TERRY: Mmm...
-He did it.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.216
-Can I spit it out or no?
-ALLY: No, Dave.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.451
(chuckling): Your mother
never made you eat vegetables?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.453
She said it wasn't worth
ruining her own life.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.455
-(Debbie chuckles)
-Makes sense.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.859
And then she said, "You can
just get something small

10:58.892 --> 11:00.627
off of the registry."

11:00.660 --> 11:05.032
Like, do you not remember
the $90 olive oil decanter

11:05.065 --> 11:06.566
that we got for your engagement?

11:06.599 --> 11:09.369
Do you, do you not
decant your olive oil

11:09.402 --> 11:10.537
every night, Julie?

11:10.570 --> 11:12.505
Are you listening?

11:12.539 --> 11:14.541
I'm almost done
with my 15 minutes of daily

11:14.574 --> 11:15.976
fan interaction.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.712
There are so many comments
lately about me being "hot."

11:18.746 --> 11:20.213
-(chuckles)
-Hey,

11:20.247 --> 11:22.349
when did I make the transition
from cute to hot?

11:22.382 --> 11:24.351
Is there a moment
you can point to?

11:24.384 --> 11:28.055
Are you gonna be like this
all weekend, or...?

11:28.088 --> 11:31.191
My bad, they've been working me
late at the Hot Guy Factory;

11:31.224 --> 11:32.860
I can't even remember
how to think.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.527
What's going on? Julie's being

11:34.561 --> 11:36.764
-mean to you, or something?
-(chuckles) Yeah.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.565
I'm sorry that's happening, but
it-it is her wedding weekend.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.067
You kind of have to let it go.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.270
I'm let-- I'm letting it go.
I'm telling you about it.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.506
Enough is enough!
You need to shut your yap!

11:46.539 --> 11:47.775
(laughs) What?

11:47.808 --> 11:48.876
-(grunts)
-Hmm.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.110
Do you want to work
on your speech?

11:50.143 --> 11:52.512
-I should, but I don't want to.
-Okay.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.414
-Let me just
inspect you for a second.
-(laughs): No.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.349
-I don't want an inspection.
-Ooh.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.418
Can we finish season two of
Handmaid's Tale?

11:58.451 --> 12:00.253
I feel like I've had enough
woman-on-woman abuse

12:00.287 --> 12:02.022
for one day.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.690
-Oh, I see.
-Sorry. (laughs)

12:03.723 --> 12:06.459
-I know what you want.
-(laughing): Oh, yeah,
what do I want?

12:06.493 --> 12:09.196
-You want me to get
in the nooks and the crevices.
-(laughing)

12:09.229 --> 12:12.099
-I hate when you say "crevices."
-You want me to inspect--
You want me to get in the nooks?

12:12.132 --> 12:14.034
(laughing):
I don't like "nooks," either.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.203
I'm picking up
what you're putting down.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.939
And just so you know, I'm ready.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.041
Start it off.
Get the ball rolling, I'm ready.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.776
-Do something to me.
-(laughs)

12:22.810 --> 12:26.880
I-I'm sensing all the cues,
I'm picking it up. Fuck me.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.648
My parents are in the next room.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.984
-(whispers): Just fuck me.
-Just-- My parents
are in the next room.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.420
You can fuck me quick.
Really?

12:33.453 --> 12:35.288
If so, you're parents
aren't listening, A;

12:35.322 --> 12:37.224
B, we can do it very quietly.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.658
I require very little friction.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.660
Yeah, that doesn't sound
like fun to me.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.429
You know I can ejaculate
hands-free?

12:42.462 --> 12:44.597
-I did not know that.
-You know what that means?

12:44.631 --> 12:48.435
-Nope.
-That-that means that I can
literally lie down...

12:48.468 --> 12:50.237
think...

12:50.270 --> 12:53.440
push my innards out...

12:53.473 --> 12:55.608
and in the right circumstance,
I will cream.

12:55.642 --> 12:59.980
Well... sounds like
you don't need me then,

13:00.013 --> 13:03.616
for your, uh, Bluetooth orgasm.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.754
-It's not
the preferred method, but...
-(sighs)

13:07.787 --> 13:10.457
I guess I'll take
what I'm given.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.625
I'm not gonna do it right now.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.928
Okay. I wasn't worried.

13:14.962 --> 13:18.331
-I'm gonna let the cream brew.
-Mm-kay.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.671
MIKE:
This is a really
good deal, Dave.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.373
-I think we should take it.
-I don't know, man.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.341
200 grand for my whole catalog
and my first album?

13:28.375 --> 13:30.010
Yes, Dave, that's how
deals work, okay?

13:30.043 --> 13:31.278
And just to be clear, dude,

13:31.311 --> 13:33.380
they're offering you $200,000

13:33.413 --> 13:36.216
for two songs about your penis
and your first album, okay?

13:36.249 --> 13:38.118
I can't believe
we're having a conversation

13:38.151 --> 13:41.288
-about this right now.
-All right, I need you
to turn over a few more stones.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.290
Get it to the ideal place, okay?

13:43.323 --> 13:44.724
Okay, bud.

13:44.757 --> 13:47.294
I'll keep turning over stones.
(clears throat) You got it.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.797
Turn it over.
Good morning, my little cherub.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.165
Are you ready to hike?

13:52.199 --> 13:56.469
Um... I--
This is a required activity?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.538
-Dave...
-I'm just joking.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.840
My whole family is going.
This is a whole thing.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.375
Well, then, I'd better
saddle on up,

14:02.409 --> 14:03.843
'cause I got a hike to hike.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.212
Okay, thank you.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.014
Is this the type of thing
where I could potentially

14:07.047 --> 14:09.482
hop on a horse?

14:09.516 --> 14:13.053
Or maybe even, like, ride a yak?

14:13.086 --> 14:15.422
(indistinct chatter nearby)

14:16.623 --> 14:19.159
-Jesus Christ.
-What is wrong now?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.861
There's terrible footing
out here, and I lost my step.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.263
This hike is so robust,

14:23.296 --> 14:25.598
and I'm, like, very close
to being out of water, so...

14:25.632 --> 14:28.035
Okay, Dave, it's a hike.
So you can get a grip.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.904
Fuck hikes.
I'm saying it right now.

14:30.938 --> 14:34.707
Uh, fuck hikes. That's actually
an interesting song title.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.543
"Fuck Hikes."

14:36.576 --> 14:38.845
-* Fuck hikes, fuck hikes *
-(giggles)

14:38.878 --> 14:40.347
* They really hurt my back *

14:40.380 --> 14:42.449
* Wait, fuck hikes,
huh, fuck hikes *

14:42.482 --> 14:44.717
* I'd rather ride a yak. *

14:44.751 --> 14:46.753
You know, you know it sounds
like you're saying,

14:46.786 --> 14:49.556
"Fuck Jews," right?
But, like, worse?

14:49.589 --> 14:51.691
How am I saying "fuck Jews"?
Fuck hikes.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.926
"Fuck kikes"?

14:52.960 --> 14:54.294
Oh, my God. Controversy sells,
so, you know...

14:54.327 --> 14:55.895
-Dave...
-I got to write this down.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.797
-No, come on.
-Got to write-- I got
to write it down.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.599
What are you talking about?
I got to write this down.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.935
I get one good idea
every three months.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.470
Okay, if you're
feeling creative,

15:03.503 --> 15:05.772
can we talk about my speech?

15:05.805 --> 15:08.575
So now you want to brainstorm
on the hike, huh?

15:08.608 --> 15:11.078
Of course, let's... where you
at with it? Let's talk about it.

15:11.111 --> 15:14.281
-I got nothing.
-Really? No progress
been made, okay.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.616
Think back to your childhood.
What did you guys do?

15:16.649 --> 15:18.485
Where did you go as a group?

15:18.518 --> 15:21.454
I don't know. I mean,
my parents would bring us to,

15:21.488 --> 15:25.425
-like, circuses
and random shows and stuff.
-What?

15:26.493 --> 15:27.927
Oh, wait-wait-wait.
(gasps)

15:27.961 --> 15:31.965
-Oh, I do have something.
Oh, I do, I do.
-We do.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.634
Oh, Dave, we did it,
I'm so happy!

15:34.667 --> 15:37.770
-And I could, like,
tie it in as a cool...
-Oh... I'm sorry.

15:37.804 --> 15:40.173
-Huh... just-- oh...
-What is wrong?

15:40.207 --> 15:41.574
Shh. I have to poop.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.310
Please don't say another word
for a second.

15:43.343 --> 15:47.314
-You have to poop?
-Yes. Please stop talking to me
for one second.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.349
Okay, can we walk it off?

15:49.382 --> 15:51.818
I don't believe so, no.
This is not a drill at all.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.121
Please turn away or something.
I need to figure this out.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.355
You have to hold it in.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.090
You can't, like, erase the past.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.358
If you can make
your innards come,

15:58.391 --> 15:59.993
you can make 'em stay.
Let's go.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.328
I'm not
a fucking scientist, man.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.795
-What?
-There's honestly no time.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.497
What do I-- Can I shit right
here? Can I do it right here?

16:04.531 --> 16:05.632
-No, you can't shit right here,
Dave.
-Why? Why?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.267
Grow up, and let's go!

16:07.300 --> 16:10.637
-It's the fucking carrots!
-Dave, you had one bite
of a carrot.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.205
You're not fucking exploding!

16:12.239 --> 16:14.041
Oh, my God.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.209
Oh, my God.
Look away! Look away! Look away!

16:16.243 --> 16:17.877
-(exclaims)
-ALLY: No, no!

16:18.678 --> 16:20.947
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

16:20.980 --> 16:22.549
(groaning)
Oh, my God.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.485
-(groaning)
-No! No, no, no!

16:25.518 --> 16:27.520
(groaning)

16:27.554 --> 16:28.955
Okay. Oh.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.758
(exhales)
I reinvented diarrhea.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.329
DAVE:
Mmm...

16:36.363 --> 16:38.731
Thank you.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.500
You know, I had an interesting
thought for your speech.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.235
-Really?
-What if you, like, twisted...

16:42.269 --> 16:45.472
Excuse me. I'm such
a huge fan of yours.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.507
-DAVE: Oh.
-Your music always puts a smile
on my face.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.741
Any way we can flick up?

16:48.775 --> 16:49.742
Sure, yeah.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.511
Awesome. Thanks, man.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.579
Let's flick up.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.281
Can you take it for us?

16:55.748 --> 16:57.084
Yeah.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.052
Thanks, puddin'.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.522
WAITER:
Horizontal, please.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.591
The man has preferences.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.759
Thanks so much.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.428
Hey, uh, y-you smoke?

17:08.461 --> 17:09.762
I'd love to burn you down,
brother.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.731
Oh! Yeah,
I like the way you think.

17:11.764 --> 17:12.732
Any interest in smoking

17:12.765 --> 17:14.934
-after this?
-No. No.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.503
-Oh. Not tonight.
-It's all good.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.171
Really, really appreciate
everything you do, man.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.507
I appreciate the way you guys
make Shirley Temples here.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.908
Great ratio.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.676
I'm sorry.
I am getting mobbed tonight.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.846
-What was the speech idea?
-Uh...

17:26.879 --> 17:28.548
-You said, the beginning
of the speech, I should...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.084
Let me get back to it.
Oh, I have the worst memory.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.519
I forgot it.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.521
I'll get it back.
Hold on, let me...

17:34.554 --> 17:35.922
(phone chimes)

17:35.955 --> 17:36.923
What was it?

17:36.956 --> 17:38.625
It was about the...

17:38.658 --> 17:39.926
Hold on.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.262
Hang on.
This is Mike about the thing.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.763
I got to...

17:43.796 --> 17:46.299
Geez, Louise.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.736
(sighs)

17:51.471 --> 17:53.072
This entire thing is...

17:53.106 --> 17:55.508
(indistinct chatter)

18:00.247 --> 18:02.482
Hey. Where you going?

18:02.515 --> 18:03.983
I'm going to bed. I'm tired.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.585
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.987
-Let me inspect you. What do...
-I-- It's...

18:08.020 --> 18:10.323
Like, is it something I did?
Tell me.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.159
I mean...
(chuckles softly)

18:12.192 --> 18:15.595
You haven't been here
all weekend, Dave.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.264
You're, like, thinking
about other stuff.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.466
-It's like...
-Thinking about other stuff?

18:19.499 --> 18:21.468
Yeah. You're thinking
about this record label

18:21.501 --> 18:23.903
or songs about hikes,
and I-I'm--

18:23.936 --> 18:25.938
I-- It's tiring. I'm tired.

18:25.972 --> 18:28.508
-Well, how can I not...
-And I-I...

18:28.541 --> 18:30.510
I don't want
to take pictures of you, okay?

18:30.543 --> 18:33.079
I-I want to be in pictures
with you.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.981
Okay, let's go up there,
kick that guy's ass,

18:35.014 --> 18:36.283
and flick up together.
I'll take any...

18:36.316 --> 18:37.450
No, I'm not joking.
I'm not, like,

18:37.484 --> 18:39.018
-making a joke, Dave.
-Okay.

18:39.051 --> 18:40.520
I'm being serious.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.822
-All right. I'm sorry.
-You're not present.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.257
Okay?

18:44.291 --> 18:45.825
And I'm not just talking
about here.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.160
Like, you're never present,

18:47.194 --> 18:49.662
and I need you
to be present with me.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.431
-Really, I'm never present?
-You're...

18:51.464 --> 18:52.999
Our whole rela--
I'm just never present?

18:53.032 --> 18:54.867
That seems like
a big blanket statement.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.603
I know that I have
so much going on right now,

18:56.636 --> 18:58.938
but, like, I have to be
thinking about this stuff and

18:58.971 --> 19:01.007
be thinking ahead at all
times with the music...

19:01.040 --> 19:04.477
Right, okay, do you ever
think ahead about us?

19:04.511 --> 19:06.145
About me and you?

19:06.179 --> 19:08.281
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah, of course.
What do you mean?

19:08.315 --> 19:10.383
What do you mean,
what do I mean? Like, you...

19:10.417 --> 19:11.718
Are you asking--
like, what do you--

19:11.751 --> 19:13.052
like, what, do you want
to marry me or something?

19:13.085 --> 19:14.487
Like, what are we doing?
Is this...?

19:14.521 --> 19:16.956
No, I'm not asking you
to marry me, Dave.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.826
I'm not, like, on one knee
right now. I'm...

19:19.859 --> 19:21.794
Okay, so, like, please...
give me clarity.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.197
I don't know what you mean--
like, speak to me with clarity.

19:24.231 --> 19:28.067
I want to be in a relationship
where I'm not always put second.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.669
You're not always put second.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.339
-I'm...
-Look-look right now, look where
we are!

19:32.372 --> 19:33.906
You realize that I have,
like, the biggest decision

19:33.940 --> 19:35.742
to make of my whole career
this weekend.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.511
-I know.
-Has to be made this weekend.
I'm here with you

19:38.545 --> 19:40.046
and your family, didn't
even consider staying back.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.481
Mike's like, "Why the fuck
are you not there?"

19:41.514 --> 19:42.749
-I'm not saying...
-What-what do you want me to do?

19:42.782 --> 19:44.917
De-prioritize my dreams?

19:44.951 --> 19:46.819
-That's not what I'm asking.
-Just so you don't feel bad
every now and then?

19:46.853 --> 19:49.088
-Like, that'd be kind of crazy.
-It's not crazy.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.990
It is not crazy to want

19:51.023 --> 19:53.893
your boyfriend to be
emotionally present with you.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.928
And I know that you are, like...

19:55.962 --> 19:59.866
an undeniable superstar,
or whatever, but it's

19:59.899 --> 20:01.768
kind of turning you
into a shitty boyfriend.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.770
Okay, well, listen
to how you're saying that,

20:03.803 --> 20:05.037
'cause you're a shitty-- yeah,

20:05.071 --> 20:06.105
you're a shitty girlfriend
for using my own

20:06.138 --> 20:07.106
self-belief against me

20:07.139 --> 20:08.174
in an argument.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.409
You have no idea what it's like

20:09.442 --> 20:11.177
to be dating a narcissist.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.212
It is so draining.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.382
It's not narcissism
when it's real, okay?

20:15.415 --> 20:16.616
-Like, no...
-It's...

20:16.649 --> 20:19.185
-Do you hear yourself?!
-I do!

20:19.218 --> 20:20.920
I know it's, I know it's not,
but you don't realize,

20:20.953 --> 20:23.290
like, how high
the stakes are for me, okay?

20:23.323 --> 20:25.692
Thank God I believe in myself
the way that I do,

20:25.725 --> 20:27.394
-or I'd never get anything done!
-Do you...?

20:27.427 --> 20:29.862
-What?
-Because you treat it like it's
your whole life!

20:29.896 --> 20:31.864
There, like, has to be something
else in life besides this one,

20:31.898 --> 20:33.566
-like, fucking
single-minded goal!
-Something else in life?!

20:33.600 --> 20:36.235
Something more than, like,
actualizing my sense of self

20:36.269 --> 20:38.204
-and feeling like I'm maximizing
my potential?!
-Oh, my God, Dave.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.806
-You don't...
-You're asking me
to sacrifice that?!

20:39.839 --> 20:41.140
That's fucking absurd!

20:41.173 --> 20:43.109
-All I do is...
-Dave, you don't get it!

20:43.142 --> 20:45.612
No, you don't get it, and I,
and I can't keep apologizing

20:45.645 --> 20:47.414
for my ambition
just 'cause you don't have any.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.081
(short laugh)

20:49.115 --> 20:50.650
(exhales)

20:50.683 --> 20:53.185
(sighs)

20:54.787 --> 20:57.189
Listen, just...

21:00.493 --> 21:02.929
(sighs)

21:10.202 --> 21:12.839
Okay, everyone look at me,
and squish together.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.342
One, two... smile.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.809
-Perfect.
-All right.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.978
-Good, we done?
-Yeah.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.581
-(exhales)
-What are you, uh, doing next?

21:21.614 --> 21:23.082
(indistinct chatter)

21:23.115 --> 21:25.885
*

21:27.654 --> 21:30.056
(phone buzzing)

21:33.993 --> 21:35.962
Yo. Give me a sec.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.765
(indistinct chatter)

21:38.798 --> 21:41.468
I'm really not ready to make
this decision right now, dude.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.103
Dave, their responses
are getting not good, okay?

21:44.136 --> 21:46.773
A-And they're gonna pull the
deal, which I got up to 250,

21:46.806 --> 21:48.375
by the way, all right?

21:48.408 --> 21:50.343
Dude, this is
the best possible scenario

21:50.377 --> 21:52.311
that we're gonna see--
you need to move on it.

21:52.345 --> 21:53.880
There are so many
horror stories of people

21:53.913 --> 21:55.548
that sign to labels and,
like, lose creative control.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.283
-You know that's true.
-Yeah.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.318
I do know that
and we've talked about this

21:59.352 --> 22:01.120
with them, remember?

22:01.153 --> 22:03.055
Th-They're not gonna
step on your toes.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.992
Dave, they like your song
"My Dick Sucks."

22:06.025 --> 22:08.461
Like, come on, man, they know
who they're signing, dude.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.129
If you want this
to be your career,

22:10.162 --> 22:11.731
you got to start
making money doing it.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.299
That's the only way to succeed.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.134
You're, you're waiting for,
like, a perfect moment.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.636
This is it, dude.

22:16.669 --> 22:17.837
Like, this is it right now.

22:17.870 --> 22:18.905
I need more time.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.473
I-If you don't sign the deal,

22:20.507 --> 22:22.308
they're gonna pull it,
all right?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.411
And then we have to start this
whole fucking thing over again.

22:24.444 --> 22:25.645
These people get you.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.713
You like them, dude.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.147
Sign the deal!

22:28.180 --> 22:29.749
-Sign the deal, Dave.
-(glass clinking)

22:29.782 --> 22:31.183
-It's that easy.
-I got to go, I got to go.

22:31.217 --> 22:33.352
I got to go right now,
I got to go, bye.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.726
So, I'm Ally,

22:39.759 --> 22:42.194
Julie's sister.

22:42.228 --> 22:45.598
And as sisters,
Julie and I competed

22:45.632 --> 22:47.567
for everything.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.437
The slice of pizza with
the most pepperoni on it,

22:50.470 --> 22:52.905
our Harry Potter books,

22:52.939 --> 22:55.442
our parents' attention,
of course.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.243
-(laughter)
-And when Julie and I

22:57.276 --> 23:00.513
competed, she always won.

23:00.547 --> 23:05.217
Because Julie is one of the most
ambitious people I know.

23:05.251 --> 23:09.355
When she wants something,
she works for it tirelessly

23:09.388 --> 23:12.925
until inevitably she gets it.

23:12.959 --> 23:15.294
It's, uh, a personality trait

23:15.327 --> 23:17.964
I can't seem to get away from.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.066
Uh, I want to tell

23:20.099 --> 23:22.401
a quick story.

23:22.435 --> 23:26.238
When we were little, our parents
brought us to a magic show.

23:26.272 --> 23:29.542
And the magician needed
a volunteer, so, of course,

23:29.576 --> 23:31.644
he picked Julie.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.412
And she went onstage.

23:33.446 --> 23:36.215
The magician counted
to three and poof!

23:36.248 --> 23:37.817
Julie was gone.

23:37.850 --> 23:41.821
And in her place was
this cute little bunny.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.723
And everyone clapped
and it was great.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.825
Then Julie came back,

23:45.858 --> 23:49.462
and I played it cool
for maybe ten seconds

23:49.496 --> 23:52.264
before I had to know
where did she go?

23:52.298 --> 23:53.633
What's the secret?

23:53.666 --> 23:54.834
Just tell me.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.569
But all she would say was,

23:56.603 --> 23:59.806
"Ally, I got turned
into a bunny."

23:59.839 --> 24:01.774
(laughter)

24:01.808 --> 24:03.676
-Do you remember this?
-Yeah.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.277
Of course she does.

24:05.311 --> 24:08.347
Because to this day,
all she'll say about it is,

24:08.380 --> 24:10.850
"I got turned into a bunny."

24:10.883 --> 24:13.953
Which has always
made me really angry.

24:13.986 --> 24:16.422
Because, honestly,
I want to know.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.125
I still want to know.
(chuckles)

24:19.158 --> 24:21.360
But then this weekend...

24:21.393 --> 24:24.831
I realized something
about magic.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.999
And honesty.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.201
And love.

24:29.235 --> 24:32.672
The magic behind... magic,

24:32.705 --> 24:34.974
uh, isn't the illusion.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.677
It's that someone cared enough

24:37.710 --> 24:40.813
to create the illusion for you.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.782
The real magic is all

24:42.815 --> 24:44.851
of the work that goes
into making somebody believe

24:44.884 --> 24:48.454
that magic is real.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.290
So... what I thought for years

24:51.323 --> 24:53.325
was you messing with me...

24:53.359 --> 24:57.463
was really just your way
of preserving the magic

24:57.496 --> 24:59.832
for me.

24:59.866 --> 25:04.136
And, Nick, she will do
the same for you.

25:04.170 --> 25:07.807
Because you mean
the world to her.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.076
And if there is
anything on this earth

25:10.109 --> 25:12.745
that she could do
to make you happy,

25:12.779 --> 25:15.147
she will work for it tirelessly

25:15.181 --> 25:17.817
until she inevitably gets it

25:17.850 --> 25:19.351
for you.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.724
And that's what makes her
so special...

25:26.192 --> 25:29.829
...is that she uses her ambition

25:29.862 --> 25:32.732
to work just as hard
in her relationship

25:32.765 --> 25:34.901
as she does at her career.

25:34.934 --> 25:38.237
And I didn't realize
until this weekend

25:38.270 --> 25:42.041
how much that mattered.

25:42.074 --> 25:45.411
But it's... everything.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.386
(voice breaking):
Love...

25:54.420 --> 25:56.555
Sorry. (chuckles)

25:56.589 --> 25:59.058
Love is just like magic.

25:59.091 --> 26:02.762
Two people build
a world for themselves

26:02.795 --> 26:05.698
and preserve it at all costs

26:05.732 --> 26:07.700
together.

26:07.734 --> 26:11.103
And I am so excited
to see the magic

26:11.137 --> 26:14.607
that you two create
for each other.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.576
(chuckles)

26:17.610 --> 26:19.712
To Julie and Nick.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.948
ALL:
To Julie and Nick.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.950
(applause)

26:27.820 --> 26:30.757
DAVE:
* So long, I can't stop *

26:30.790 --> 26:32.424
-ALLY: Dave.
-* Do this with me *

26:32.458 --> 26:36.262
-I'm leaving.
-* Have it your way *

26:36.295 --> 26:38.998
* I know I'm late *

26:39.031 --> 26:41.567
* But it's okay *

26:41.600 --> 26:45.304
ALLY:
* No, we don't have
time to wait * Oh.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.907
DAVE:
* We're gonna have
the best time *

26:47.940 --> 26:49.976
ALLY:
Dave, you have to change.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.744
DAVE:
* Do you remember
when you got all mad *

26:51.778 --> 26:53.980
* 'Cause I threw out
that flyer? *

26:54.013 --> 26:55.682
ALLY:
That was not a flyer.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.183
I told you.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.251
DAVE:
* Yes, it was *

26:59.285 --> 27:02.521
-ALLY:
* No, it was a save the date *
-(harmonizing)

27:02.554 --> 27:04.090
DAVE:
* It's the same thing,
it's gonna end up *

27:04.123 --> 27:05.992
* On a fridge either way *

27:06.025 --> 27:07.760
-ALLY: Fine.
-* This weekend *

27:07.794 --> 27:09.962
* You're gonna dance with me *

27:09.996 --> 27:12.598
ALLY:
* Yes, of course, I love you *

27:12.631 --> 27:15.334
* But we really got
to go right now *

27:15.367 --> 27:17.804
DAVE: * All right, well, this
was fun while it lasted. *

27:17.837 --> 27:19.772
ALLY:
Mm-hmm. (chuckles)

28:22.234 --> 28:23.903
-(throaty hiss)
-Ooh, ooh, ooh.

28:25.772 --> 28:27.073
-Text me.
-Nope.

GUILLERMO:
The journey was perilous,

28:37.416 --> 28:41.053
but Nandor the Relentless
stood tall and proud.

28:41.087 --> 28:45.557
Thus, the noble vampire set sail
to conquer the new world

28:45.591 --> 28:47.894
for the greater glory
of the undead.

28:47.927 --> 28:51.263
-Does my hair
really look that billowy?
-(wind blows)

28:51.297 --> 28:52.899
Looks fantastic.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.334
I'd never wear anything
like that.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.905
(retching)

29:01.407 --> 29:03.810
(gagging, coughing)

29:03.843 --> 29:04.844
(squeaks)

29:06.512 --> 29:07.847
Oh, damn!

29:07.947 --> 29:09.248
(classical music playing)

29:18.324 --> 29:20.626
Pulling hair is wrong, mate.

29:20.659 --> 29:23.930
I mean, all violence is wrong,
but at least punching's a sport.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.497
-Is it?
-Yes, boxing.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.633
Boxing's in the Olympics.
Hair pulling isn't.

29:28.835 --> 29:31.871
-It would be funny if it was.
-It really would be.

29:38.144 --> 29:39.345
(laughter)

29:39.378 --> 29:41.380
How did you come to write
The Feminine Mystique?

29:41.480 --> 29:43.149
I thought there was
something wrong with me

29:43.182 --> 29:46.318
because I didn't have
an orgasm waxing
the kitchen floor.

29:46.352 --> 29:47.653
-(laughing)
-(audience claps)

29:54.160 --> 29:55.294
What is Devs?

29:56.328 --> 29:57.629
What is Devs?

29:57.663 --> 29:58.998
What is Devs?

30:00.232 --> 30:01.500
(screams)
