M_I_SForEver

01:54.532 --> 01:54.991
What?

01:56.325 --> 01:57.658
I was just wondering
why you didn't keep those

01:57.660 --> 01:59.161
in the other truck
with the missiles.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.914
Trevors and Saunders are
keeping watch back there.

02:02.832 --> 02:03.916
No offense, Sergeant Bartlett,

02:04.166 --> 02:06.002
but I don't know you and
I don't know your team.

02:06.669 --> 02:07.878
What's that supposed to mean?

02:08.211 --> 02:10.169
It means that the guidance
chips in this case'll

02:10.172 --> 02:11.382
make those weapons
we just intercepted

02:11.632 --> 02:13.384
find your mother's house
with pin-point accuracy

02:13.634 --> 02:14.885
and wipe it off the map.

02:15.428 --> 02:17.013
So a little precaution
goes a long way,

02:17.179 --> 02:18.139
if you catch me drift.

02:18.848 --> 02:19.432
See, kid?

02:20.516 --> 02:21.434
Spend enough years
in the service,

02:21.684 --> 02:22.893
this is what happens to ya.

02:23.394 --> 02:25.187
I'm just planning on
doing two tours, Sergeant.

02:26.689 --> 02:27.148
Then I'm out.

02:28.274 --> 02:30.190
See?
Beasley's got the right idea.

02:30.192 --> 02:32.111
Look like we're all fucked up
hanging around, huh?

02:32.945 --> 02:34.530
You don't like your job,
do something about it.

02:52.298 --> 02:53.341
What do you think
you're doing?

02:55.092 --> 02:56.177
I'm just having a look.

02:57.762 --> 02:58.179
Well, don't.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.056
Chill out.

03:00.848 --> 03:01.724
Won't do harm.

03:04.644 --> 03:06.062
Fuck me.

03:07.104 --> 03:08.814
I could bling up my
whole bathroom in this lot.

03:09.607 --> 03:10.650
Why would you wanna do that?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.028
So I can shit...

03:15.196 --> 03:16.864
on a golden throne.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.992
Why the fuck wouldn't you
wanna do that?

03:21.077 --> 03:22.453
Because I'm not a 10-year-old.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.467
<i>I see multiple tangos coming in</i>

03:38.469 --> 03:39.637
<i>from the northeast.</i>

03:42.223 --> 03:43.099
Roger that.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.476
Get ready to knock their
lights off and then floor it.

03:51.482 --> 03:52.400
I can't see shit!

04:00.032 --> 04:00.783
What's the plan?

04:01.742 --> 04:02.284
Over.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.331
We don't flinch until
we know we have to. Out.

04:07.498 --> 04:08.497
These are the priority.

04:08.499 --> 04:10.042
The missiles are useless
without 'em.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.545
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be just...

04:52.084 --> 04:53.419
Bartlett, are you hit?

04:55.379 --> 04:56.088
Guys?

04:58.758 --> 04:59.508
Shit.

05:21.197 --> 05:21.989
Where the fuck is everyone?

05:23.157 --> 05:24.158
Dead, I think.

05:27.536 --> 05:28.287
Beasley, wait!

07:32.286 --> 07:33.120
Fuck.

08:06.445 --> 08:07.321
Oh, piece...

08:08.197 --> 08:10.032
Oh, fucking Comstar.

08:38.811 --> 08:39.645
How's it going?

08:41.313 --> 08:41.772
Yo!

08:42.481 --> 08:43.440
Just counting bullets.

08:44.942 --> 08:45.442
Again.

08:47.236 --> 08:48.529
We need to find
another game, man.

08:59.665 --> 09:00.541
Stop smoking.

10:19.161 --> 10:20.496
There's no need
for any more violence.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.457
Everything's gone to plan.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.189
Amir!

10:55.739 --> 10:57.324
I wouldn't call this
going to plan, Amir.

10:57.699 --> 10:58.824
Who's this?

10:58.826 --> 10:59.576
This is the one you were
supposed to

10:59.743 --> 11:00.826
let run off and live!

11:00.828 --> 11:01.912
Well, who did we
just let go then?

11:02.538 --> 11:04.915
You just let the guy with
the fucking guidance chips go!

11:05.290 --> 11:06.250
I told you to shoot the old one!

11:06.458 --> 11:07.334
You all look the same!

11:11.213 --> 11:13.632
Okay, relax.
He's injured, he's on foot.

11:13.882 --> 11:14.716
We'll get him back.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.719
Well, you better, 'cause if
you wanna sell these missiles

11:17.970 --> 11:19.513
to your buyer,
we need that case.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.391
It's fine, I'll handle this.

11:39.241 --> 11:40.492
What the fuck are we gonna do?

11:41.160 --> 11:42.411
Beasley telling everyone
we're dead

11:42.661 --> 11:43.996
was our way
of getting away with this.

11:45.164 --> 11:45.998
Now what?

11:46.206 --> 11:49.334
As far as anyone's gonna know,
Amir stole the missiles.

11:49.585 --> 11:50.544
We're just MIA.

12:15.319 --> 12:16.028
Hello?

12:17.446 --> 12:17.988
Hello?

12:19.072 --> 12:20.616
Oh, God damn signal.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.411
<i>Rana, are you there?</i>

12:25.078 --> 12:26.413
Yeah, I can hear you.

12:27.080 --> 12:27.998
How are you guys?

12:28.207 --> 12:29.666
<i>Same as always,
really.</i>

12:30.292 --> 12:31.043
You?

12:31.668 --> 12:32.211
Bored.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.463
The whole unit is out
protecting a main road.

12:35.672 --> 12:36.673
It's election day coming up.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.467
<i>And they didn't take you?</i>

12:39.134 --> 12:39.676
Nope.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.430
How's the money situation?

12:44.097 --> 12:44.848
<i>Not great.</i>

12:45.098 --> 12:47.100
<i>The pensions office are
considering Dad's appeal,</i>

12:47.351 --> 12:48.810
<i>so we've just gotta wait.</i>

12:49.895 --> 12:52.105
<i>I've got three jobs now
which is killing me.</i>

12:53.440 --> 12:54.650
<i>It's ridiculous.</i>

12:55.067 --> 12:57.986
<i>As if Dad's fought all those
years just to get no pension.</i>

13:00.948 --> 13:01.907
I'll figure something out.

13:02.407 --> 13:02.950
<i>How?</i>

13:03.158 --> 13:05.035
<i>You're in the exact same
boat as him, dumb-arse.</i>

13:05.285 --> 13:07.663
Oh, come on.
It's not like that.

13:07.913 --> 13:08.538
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

13:08.789 --> 13:11.166
<i>You're gonna steal a tank
and sell it or something?</i>

13:12.042 --> 13:12.542
No.

13:13.085 --> 13:14.544
<i>Well, shut up then.</i>

13:17.631 --> 13:18.173
Hello?

13:19.633 --> 13:21.051
Hello? No, please.

13:21.718 --> 13:22.469
Come on.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.888
Fucking shit.

13:35.190 --> 13:37.359
Oh, give me a fucking break.

13:44.992 --> 13:45.909
Good day, sweetheart?

13:46.410 --> 13:47.119
Yep.

13:47.744 --> 13:48.745
Well...

13:50.163 --> 13:51.748
Better than getting shot at,
I suppose.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.334
I emptied out
the magazines for ya,

13:54.584 --> 13:55.752
so you've got something to do.

13:57.045 --> 13:57.963
Counting rounds all night.

13:58.714 --> 13:59.673
Great.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.049
You wanna know
how many there is?

14:01.425 --> 14:02.467
I don't like spoilers.

14:04.803 --> 14:05.470
There's 400.

14:06.013 --> 14:06.555
Fuck off, Gaje.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.610
397.

14:24.573 --> 14:25.741
398.

14:29.161 --> 14:31.371
399.

14:32.039 --> 14:32.998
Oh, come on.

14:37.419 --> 14:38.170
Bastard.

14:40.839 --> 14:41.256
Okay.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.534
This is a British base!
I will shoot you!

15:50.951 --> 15:51.660
Don't shoot!

15:52.077 --> 15:53.203
We're on the same side!

15:54.121 --> 15:55.664
I need help, please.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.290
I've got the Taliban
tracking me.

15:57.541 --> 15:58.291
They're heading this way.

16:00.961 --> 16:01.461
How many?

16:02.546 --> 16:03.130
How many what?

16:03.755 --> 16:05.006
Taliban. How many?

16:05.549 --> 16:06.967
I'll just pop back
and count, shall I?

16:07.217 --> 16:08.009
I don't know, loads!

16:08.427 --> 16:10.178
I'm sorry to bring this to
your doorstep, I really am,

16:10.387 --> 16:12.139
but my problem is about
to become your problem

16:12.347 --> 16:13.181
very quickly.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.059
Are you injured?

16:17.352 --> 16:19.187
Hit in the side,
no exit wound.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.150
I don't mean to rush you, mate,

16:25.152 --> 16:26.609
but you're gonna have to take
a leap of faith with this one,

16:26.611 --> 16:27.404
it's now or never.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.122
How many rounds you got?

16:38.957 --> 16:39.708
Just the one mag.

16:41.626 --> 16:42.752
I'm gonna grab my ammo first.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.797
Get your stuff together
and let's go hide.

16:46.590 --> 16:47.007
Hide?

16:49.217 --> 16:50.550
Where are the rest of your men?

16:50.552 --> 16:53.180
Not here, me and the guy
asleep are all you've got.

16:54.890 --> 16:55.640
Fuck me.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.063
You guys have
working coms, right?

17:02.647 --> 17:04.858
Sort of,
the signal comes and goes.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.068
Just needs to last long enough
to get an evac call out.

17:08.111 --> 17:08.987
Where is it?

17:10.446 --> 17:11.823
We can use the coms unit
in that Humvee over there.

18:05.669 --> 18:06.670
What about these guys?

18:11.049 --> 18:11.800
We keep quiet.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.176
We make the call.

18:14.344 --> 18:15.679
Then I say
we just fucking kill 'em.

18:18.139 --> 18:18.765
Works for me.

18:32.946 --> 18:33.863
How bad are you hurt?

18:36.283 --> 18:37.158
I'll be fine.

18:39.160 --> 18:39.911
Keep low.

19:15.614 --> 19:17.157
Gonna need to get this bullet
out of me fairly soon.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.743
You want the radio or surgery?

19:20.410 --> 19:21.161
Radio.

19:35.008 --> 19:35.592
Fuck sake.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.844
Let me guess, you need
a new service provider, right?

19:38.428 --> 19:39.179
Yeah.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.349
I'm gonna have to go
and restart the box.

19:43.933 --> 19:44.434
Where's that?

19:46.227 --> 19:46.895
Tower.

19:47.646 --> 19:48.521
Course it is.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.148
That's gonna be
pretty difficult.

19:51.941 --> 19:52.692
Okay.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.156
Well?

19:59.491 --> 20:02.744
Well, I'm just gonna have to
go for it.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.626
Hey, what's your name?

20:10.627 --> 20:11.044
Rana.

20:11.836 --> 20:12.379
I'm Noah.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.663
<i>Let's start this meditation</i>

20:47.247 --> 20:50.959
<i>to remind you
that your true self</i>

20:51.668 --> 20:53.628
<i>is a non-smoker.</i>

20:54.796 --> 20:57.257
<i>Feel the healthy energy</i>

20:58.258 --> 21:00.176
<i>flow through you.</i>

21:01.511 --> 21:04.639
<i>You are the mountains.</i>

21:05.098 --> 21:07.684
<i>You feel relaxed.</i>

21:08.143 --> 21:10.103
<i>You feel calm.</i>

21:11.146 --> 21:13.356
<i>You feel strong.</i>

21:14.566 --> 21:16.484
<i>Breathe.</i>

21:17.694 --> 21:21.322
<i>Well done
for doing this meditation</i>

21:22.198 --> 21:24.159
<i>to remind you</i>

21:24.951 --> 21:26.035
<i>that you</i>

21:27.120 --> 21:30.749
<i>are a healthy non-smoker.</i>

23:40.169 --> 23:40.920
Shit.

23:52.307 --> 23:53.057
Fuck it.

25:01.250 --> 25:01.960
Gaje.

25:02.460 --> 25:03.169
Gaje.

25:17.183 --> 25:17.976
I know.

25:19.894 --> 25:20.853
I told them for you.

26:22.331 --> 26:23.541
Let's get that bullet
out of you.

26:44.562 --> 26:45.104
Okay.

26:45.897 --> 26:46.647
Okay.

26:56.449 --> 26:57.200
Fuck.

27:35.446 --> 27:36.197
Okay.

27:37.949 --> 27:38.825
This is gonna hurt.

27:40.618 --> 27:41.285
Oh, you think?

27:42.745 --> 27:43.788
It's not my first rodeo.

27:45.123 --> 27:45.790
Come on.

27:48.584 --> 27:49.127
Up.

27:51.087 --> 27:51.754
Okay.

27:55.883 --> 27:56.551
Right.

27:59.095 --> 27:59.846
Your hands are cold.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.266
- Special Forces.
- What about us?

28:04.183 --> 28:05.309
You guys love
shooting each other.

28:06.519 --> 28:07.395
Just get on with it.

28:08.312 --> 28:09.188
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

28:09.981 --> 28:10.606
And in.

28:14.777 --> 28:15.987
- Oh, fuck.
- All right.

28:21.826 --> 28:23.161
All better?

28:24.412 --> 28:25.371
Oh, yeah, I feel great.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.498
Speak to the nurse
on your way out.

28:28.249 --> 28:30.126
She'll give you a lollipop
for being a good boy.

28:33.129 --> 28:34.046
That's cute.

28:41.262 --> 28:42.013
Listen.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.141
I'm sorry about your friend.

28:46.642 --> 28:47.226
Thanks.

28:49.437 --> 28:50.271
He was a good guy.

28:51.105 --> 28:51.647
Yeah.

28:52.899 --> 28:55.818
I'd drink to that,
but I'm out.

28:57.111 --> 28:58.029
Wanna tell me why he died?

29:03.701 --> 29:04.660
Why are they after that?

29:16.047 --> 29:18.382
They're guidance chips for
some pretty serious missiles

29:18.925 --> 29:20.927
that me and my squad
were transporting.

29:21.969 --> 29:23.971
We intercepted them being sold
on the black market.

29:25.264 --> 29:25.973
Along with a lot of gold.

29:27.183 --> 29:27.892
Shit.

29:30.770 --> 29:31.979
Then we were ambushed
on the way back.

29:34.232 --> 29:35.149
They killed the squad.

29:36.317 --> 29:38.110
I managed to get out with those.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.114
The missiles are useless
without 'em.

29:43.324 --> 29:46.077
Titanium-cased,
so they can't be smashed.

29:47.203 --> 29:49.872
Each one's got an individual
tracker, so even if we hide 'em

29:50.957 --> 29:51.958
they're gonna find 'em
eventually.

29:53.292 --> 29:56.170
So it's nowhere near over
is what you're telling me?

29:58.214 --> 29:59.298
That's kind of
what I'm telling you.

30:03.219 --> 30:04.011
Any ideas?

30:06.305 --> 30:08.391
We get in a truck and
we drive as far as we can.

30:09.350 --> 30:09.976
Yeah, right.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.520
This whole region is Taliban.

30:13.104 --> 30:14.480
We'd be dead in a few hours.

30:16.774 --> 30:17.692
That leaves Plan B.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.110
Plan B?

30:19.443 --> 30:22.029
There's a satellite phone on
the truck where I came from.

30:23.364 --> 30:24.240
Where the missiles are?

30:24.991 --> 30:25.449
Uh-huh.

30:27.201 --> 30:28.286
Where the Taliban are?

30:29.203 --> 30:29.870
Uh-huh.

30:30.121 --> 30:31.080
Oh, Jesus.

30:32.081 --> 30:34.959
You know, I'd totally
volunteer to go meself, but,

30:35.960 --> 30:37.003
I've kinda got a hole in me.

30:37.420 --> 30:38.296
Should patch it up.

30:41.132 --> 30:41.757
Fine.

30:43.592 --> 30:44.510
Show me where to go.

30:46.178 --> 30:46.721
Okay.

31:50.451 --> 31:51.786
What the fuck?

33:27.840 --> 33:29.175
It's taking
way too fucking long.

33:31.260 --> 33:33.012
Oh,
quit your fucking whining.

33:33.262 --> 33:35.639
Bartlett says it's fine,
then it's fine.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.266
I'll make sure they
put that on your grave

33:37.475 --> 33:38.767
when they hang us for treason.

37:04.306 --> 37:05.724
That was HQ, guys.

37:12.231 --> 37:13.315
This is getting too risky now.

37:13.774 --> 37:14.650
- Sage.
- What?

37:15.150 --> 37:16.318
Shut the fuck up.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.486
No, he's right.

37:18.654 --> 37:20.072
Look, we've got the gold.

37:20.698 --> 37:21.740
The missiles are a dead end.

37:23.075 --> 37:25.035
I think we need to start
talking about splitting it

37:25.285 --> 37:26.537
and getting
the fuck out of here.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.083
We should at least
put it to a vote.

37:31.333 --> 37:33.544
- I'd be up for that.
- No one's voting on anything.

37:35.129 --> 37:36.130
We wait.

37:37.381 --> 37:39.091
Let these lot
retrieve the chips.

37:43.303 --> 37:44.054
We're not blowing our cover

37:44.304 --> 37:45.973
for the sake of
a few extra hours.

37:46.348 --> 37:47.933
And what happens when our
newfound friends start getting

37:48.183 --> 37:49.435
all trigger happy
in our direction, eh?

37:49.685 --> 37:50.310
They won't.

37:51.270 --> 37:52.312
Famous last words.

37:52.521 --> 37:54.356
Yeah, well, in the meantime,
what're we gonna do about HQ?

37:56.692 --> 37:59.153
I'll go and speak to Amir,
get him to hurry the fuck up.

38:34.646 --> 38:35.814
The sat phone's gone!

38:37.399 --> 38:38.150
Fuck.

38:40.861 --> 38:42.488
Saddle up,
the situation's changed.

38:42.738 --> 38:43.697
We're going after him.

39:11.517 --> 39:12.476
What happened to you?

39:17.940 --> 39:18.649
Fair enough.

39:21.985 --> 39:23.654
By the way.

39:24.613 --> 39:25.155
Your squad.

39:26.281 --> 39:27.074
They're not dead.

39:28.116 --> 39:28.784
What?

39:31.703 --> 39:33.247
Well we've got to go back,
we've got to rescue them.

39:33.622 --> 39:35.457
No, they're not dead
because they're working

39:35.707 --> 39:37.459
with these guys
to sell those missiles.

39:39.503 --> 39:40.796
That doesn't make any sense.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.258
Well, I mean, sure.

39:45.217 --> 39:46.718
Why would a bunch of
highly-trained,

39:46.969 --> 39:48.011
underpaid soldiers

39:48.554 --> 39:51.223
want to steal a load of gold
and sell a few missiles?

39:54.309 --> 39:55.394
I overheard them talking.

39:57.271 --> 39:58.272
They're all coming here,
by the way.

39:59.439 --> 40:00.607
- How many?
- I don't know.

40:00.983 --> 40:02.192
So hurry up and make the call.

40:05.654 --> 40:07.489
Fucking Afghanistan.

40:08.657 --> 40:10.200
I swear to God, if I never
see another mountain again,

40:10.492 --> 40:11.785
it's gonna be too soon.

40:14.621 --> 40:15.205
The lookout.

40:16.540 --> 40:17.958
It should give you enough
height to call out.

40:20.669 --> 40:22.588
Okay, how many rounds we got?

40:39.771 --> 40:40.731
250 rounds.

40:43.150 --> 40:44.276
We've gotta make 'em count.

40:49.072 --> 40:49.990
Oh, come on.

40:51.074 --> 40:51.950
Looks like they're here.

40:52.492 --> 40:53.869
I don't get paid enough
for this.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.415
We don't do this
for the money.

41:01.084 --> 41:02.669
Yeah, tell me about it.

41:21.313 --> 41:22.773
It's your phone,
you go and get it.

41:27.194 --> 41:27.945
Let's get something
really clear.

41:28.195 --> 41:29.237
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:29.571 --> 41:30.238
Don't like you,

41:31.698 --> 41:33.114
and I don't like your
shitty little country, either.

41:33.116 --> 41:34.701
And I certainly don't trust ya.

41:35.577 --> 41:37.537
So if you want these missiles
like we agreed,

41:37.788 --> 41:38.872
then you go in there.

41:39.748 --> 41:41.122
Stop 'em from using
that sat phone

41:41.124 --> 41:42.334
and get the chips back.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.128
Me and my men will be right
here protecting this truck.

41:47.130 --> 41:48.382
Do I make myself clear?

41:49.216 --> 41:52.511
You know,
it's a good job I like you.

41:53.637 --> 41:56.014
Don't worry, we'll handle this.

42:10.195 --> 42:13.240
Johnson, get up there on that
high point with your rifle.

42:13.907 --> 42:15.951
You get a clear shot on Noah,
you take it.

42:16.994 --> 42:17.869
Don't hesitate.

42:18.120 --> 42:18.787
Roger that.

42:21.456 --> 42:23.333
You lot,
guard the truck.

42:23.583 --> 42:24.960
These fucks are gonna try
and screw us

42:25.210 --> 42:26.962
the second they get
their hands on those chips.

42:42.185 --> 42:43.228
I just wanna retire.

42:59.161 --> 43:01.663
We've got company, lots of it.

43:03.123 --> 43:05.125
Let's show 'em what
we think of uninvited guests.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.837
You're an uninvited guest.

43:11.214 --> 43:11.673
True.

43:12.966 --> 43:14.051
Fucking Gurkhas.

43:22.601 --> 43:24.144
We know this place is empty!

43:25.353 --> 43:28.565
Your entire unit's on patrol,
40 miles west of here!

43:29.191 --> 43:32.444
So at best there's maybe
two or three of you left?

43:34.112 --> 43:37.657
Just hand over the soldier
and we'll just leave!

43:38.784 --> 43:40.410
There's no need to die
for no reason.

43:55.717 --> 43:56.551
In position.

43:57.344 --> 43:58.470
No sign of target.

44:00.013 --> 44:00.555
Received.

44:02.099 --> 44:03.308
Keep eyes on Amir, too.

44:04.059 --> 44:04.893
Roger that.

44:51.648 --> 44:52.983
Target sighted with one other.

44:56.361 --> 44:57.362
Take 'em both out.

44:58.238 --> 44:59.030
Roger that.

45:03.952 --> 45:04.911
Where did that come from?

45:05.245 --> 45:05.954
Sniper.

45:06.830 --> 45:08.039
Johnson, at a guess.

45:09.249 --> 45:12.085
Well, I think Johnson
is a prick.

45:12.752 --> 45:13.712
Just so you know.

45:14.212 --> 45:15.172
You and me both.

45:27.475 --> 45:28.894
You should make a run
for the lookout.

45:29.728 --> 45:31.104
I'll head the other way
and draw their fire.

45:32.147 --> 45:33.940
You're laying down your life
for a noble cause?

45:35.775 --> 45:36.610
Thinking about it.

45:38.028 --> 45:40.655
Wait until they all
follow me and then you go.

45:43.241 --> 45:43.825
Okay.

46:26.201 --> 46:28.078
Johnson, what's happening?
I'm getting itchy feet here.

46:28.536 --> 46:29.621
I've lost Noah.

46:30.121 --> 46:32.916
I think he's heading
for the lookout. Over.

46:33.124 --> 46:34.167
Does he have the sat phone?

46:37.170 --> 46:37.921
Say again. Over.

46:38.338 --> 46:40.090
Does he have
the fucking sat phone?

46:41.174 --> 46:42.801
Amir and his men
are heading your way.

46:43.134 --> 46:46.137
I repeat, Amir and his
men are heading your way.

46:47.430 --> 46:48.807
Everyone keep
your eyes peeled.

46:49.766 --> 46:51.977
Oh, fuck this.
Going for a look around.

46:56.273 --> 46:58.400
I'll go after Noah
and the chips. Out.

47:37.272 --> 47:38.481
Are you telling me one Gurkha

47:38.732 --> 47:40.108
is causing
all this fucking carnage?

47:41.109 --> 47:43.153
I have got to meet this guy.

47:43.403 --> 47:44.779
Johnson, are you receiving?
Over.

47:54.080 --> 47:54.539
What?

47:55.081 --> 47:55.957
I see movement.

47:59.502 --> 48:00.337
I don't see it.

48:01.546 --> 48:02.339
It's right...

48:13.099 --> 48:14.059
Find the hanger.

48:14.267 --> 48:17.103
Get the merch switched into
a new truck, be back in 10.

48:17.354 --> 48:18.480
Where the fuck are you going?

48:19.731 --> 48:20.690
I'm gonna kill Amir.

49:04.401 --> 49:05.151
Come on!

49:22.710 --> 49:23.420
Amir!

49:25.964 --> 49:26.631
Don't shoot!

49:28.550 --> 49:29.884
Okay, that was a mistake.

49:31.594 --> 49:33.138
But we still have business
to attend to.

49:34.889 --> 49:35.640
How so?

49:36.266 --> 49:38.143
You need me
to finish the sale.

49:39.060 --> 49:40.979
My buyer will only meet
if I'm alive.

49:43.481 --> 49:44.315
Do you know what, Amir?

49:46.192 --> 49:47.152
I'll find another buyer.

49:52.532 --> 49:54.784
Akon zero alpha,
this is akon two zero.

49:55.034 --> 49:55.952
Are you receiving? Over.

49:59.456 --> 50:01.583
Akon zero alpha,
this is akon two zero.

50:01.833 --> 50:03.042
Are you receiving? Over.

50:04.794 --> 50:05.628
<i>Akon two
zero, this is akon zero alpha.</i>

50:05.879 --> 50:07.213
<i>Send your message. Over.</i>

50:07.630 --> 50:10.592
My unit has switched,
I repeat, my unit has switched.

50:10.800 --> 50:11.759
Are you hearing this?

50:12.844 --> 50:14.804
<i>They're attempting to sell
the missiles to the Taliban.</i>

50:15.555 --> 50:17.015
I still have the guidance chips,
though.

50:18.683 --> 50:20.810
<i>Multiple tangos
are within my location.</i>

50:21.227 --> 50:23.563
Requesting immediate evac. Over.

50:24.397 --> 50:25.940
<i>We've tracked your location...</i>

50:29.486 --> 50:30.528
Repeat that?

50:30.778 --> 50:32.530
Did you say eight-zero minutes?

50:37.827 --> 50:38.578
Fucking...

50:41.581 --> 50:42.957
This doesn't change anything.

50:43.750 --> 50:45.126
This fucking changes
everything.

50:45.376 --> 50:47.962
They know what we've done now,
how're we gonna explain that?

50:49.088 --> 50:49.589
I'm thinking.

51:06.898 --> 51:08.064
We need to go in there,

51:08.066 --> 51:09.067
kill these fuckers
and get out of here.

51:09.234 --> 51:10.525
Will you two pair of pricks

51:10.527 --> 51:12.445
just shut the fuck up
and let me think?

51:15.949 --> 51:16.991
Go and get Espinosa!

51:31.714 --> 51:32.799
Jesus Christ.

51:34.092 --> 51:35.009
I nearly killed you.

51:37.345 --> 51:38.263
Good to see you too.

51:42.141 --> 51:43.685
Rough night?

51:44.644 --> 51:45.436
You could say that.

51:46.938 --> 51:47.981
Taliban are all dead.

51:49.440 --> 51:50.024
I saw.

51:52.277 --> 51:53.111
Did you make the call?

51:55.280 --> 51:56.114
Yeah.

51:57.699 --> 51:58.575
80 minutes.

51:59.659 --> 52:00.785
Great.

52:02.120 --> 52:03.037
Especially now.

52:04.163 --> 52:04.956
I'm out of rounds.

52:06.249 --> 52:07.000
Me too.

52:12.505 --> 52:13.131
Look.

52:14.841 --> 52:16.301
All we have to do
is keep the chips safe

52:17.010 --> 52:18.136
and hidden for long enough.

52:20.597 --> 52:22.515
There are some tunnels
under the base we've got.

52:23.308 --> 52:24.183
In case of air strikes.

52:25.643 --> 52:26.352
That could work.

52:26.978 --> 52:29.397
The entrance is inside one
of the containers in the yard.

52:31.149 --> 52:32.358
We need the keys in
the rec room though.

52:33.109 --> 52:33.818
Right.

52:35.111 --> 52:35.945
No time like the present.

53:18.655 --> 53:20.406
Shit.

53:22.241 --> 53:23.034
How bad is it?

53:25.787 --> 53:26.412
I'll live.

53:30.041 --> 53:31.167
I wouldn't count on it.

53:39.175 --> 53:39.842
You're out!

53:40.176 --> 53:41.010
Yeah.

53:42.178 --> 53:43.805
But I got lot more left in me.

53:45.473 --> 53:46.224
Have you?

53:50.186 --> 53:51.187
Nah.

53:59.612 --> 54:01.114
I'm pretty much done
to be honest.

54:04.742 --> 54:05.535
But I do have him.

56:08.449 --> 56:11.077
You know,
the next time you visit...

56:12.829 --> 56:13.454
Uh-huh?

56:14.121 --> 56:15.081
Call first.

58:38.933 --> 58:39.600
Get inside.

58:40.518 --> 58:43.187
The entrance to the tunnels
is at the back of the container.

58:45.523 --> 58:46.190
What about you?

58:47.650 --> 58:48.901
Someone's gotta save your ass.

58:52.154 --> 58:53.195
Just go.

58:53.197 --> 58:55.658
Pull the hatch down
and keep these safe.

58:59.203 --> 59:00.246
Try not to die.

59:01.706 --> 59:02.248
Yeah.

59:03.165 --> 59:03.916
You too.

01:00:37.927 --> 01:00:38.719
Where's Noah?

01:00:40.096 --> 01:00:40.679
I don't know.

01:00:44.183 --> 01:00:44.642
Okay.

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:10.000
Oi!

01:01:10.793 --> 01:01:11.961
We got you a present.

01:01:12.837 --> 01:01:14.004
- The chips?
- What?

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.173
Where are
the fucking chips?

01:01:16.632 --> 01:01:19.510
There was no sign of Noah
or the chips,

01:01:19.844 --> 01:01:21.637
but my guess is
this little prick

01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:22.972
knows where
the both of them are.

01:01:23.848 --> 01:01:25.141
Right, go and
get him tied down.

01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:26.016
I'll be there in a minute.

01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:28.602
Trevors, when you're done,
go and help Sage get them

01:01:28.853 --> 01:01:30.604
missiles moved from that
old truck into this one.

01:01:30.855 --> 01:01:32.606
I wanna be out of here in
the next 60, you understand?

01:01:32.898 --> 01:01:33.566
Yes, sir.

01:01:33.816 --> 01:01:34.608
Get a move on.

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:05.055
Good morning, sunshine.

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:19.987
I don't think
there's any need for that.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:22.198
What do you think?

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:29.038
I think you better hope
she tied these ropes well.

01:02:30.331 --> 01:02:32.374
Because if I get out
of this chair,

01:02:33.542 --> 01:02:35.044
I'm gonna kill you with it.

01:02:46.055 --> 01:02:47.890
You know what I see
when I look in your eyes?

01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.976
Sorry, pal.

01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:53.020
You're not my type.

01:02:58.234 --> 01:02:59.818
I see zero fear.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.447
Not remotely scared, are ya?

01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:05.783
It comes with the training.

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:31.809
Still nothing.

01:03:40.192 --> 01:03:41.110
How about now?

01:03:49.076 --> 01:03:50.035
Fascinating.

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.456
You guys really are tough
as fuck, aren't you?

01:03:57.209 --> 01:04:00.004
So...

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:04.174
I'm gonna kill her first.

01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:06.552
Oh, yeah?

01:04:07.261 --> 01:04:07.886
Yeah.

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:13.684
And then I'm gonna shove
her head up your ass.

01:04:22.443 --> 01:04:24.236
We've actually got a lot
in common, me and you.

01:04:27.573 --> 01:04:28.991
I had a little look
'round your stuff.

01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:30.868
Hope that's okay.

01:04:32.828 --> 01:04:34.580
Your old man was
a Gurkha too, I take it.

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:38.042
How's retirement going for him?

01:04:38.667 --> 01:04:40.836
Don't talk about him.

01:04:42.421 --> 01:04:43.339
Let me guess.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:46.050
The army's not covering
the bills

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.635
now he's not out there risking
his life for them anymore.

01:04:52.181 --> 01:04:53.474
Struggling to make ends meet.

01:04:55.434 --> 01:04:56.685
Barely covering the rent.

01:05:01.357 --> 01:05:03.192
And you're out here doing
the exact same thing.

01:05:04.693 --> 01:05:06.068
The sad fucking truth is,

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:08.280
you're going to end up
in the exact same boat.

01:05:09.907 --> 01:05:11.241
Broke and begging for handouts.

01:05:13.869 --> 01:05:14.787
Does that seem right to you?

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:21.627
You risk your life
for your country,

01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:25.047
your father risks his too,

01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:27.424
and for what?

01:05:30.719 --> 01:05:31.720
Doesn't that make you angry?

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.142
See?

01:05:38.352 --> 01:05:39.019
We're the same.

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:41.647
So are all my guys.

01:05:45.192 --> 01:05:46.902
Where's our reward
for taking bullets

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:49.071
so some snot-nosed little cunt
can sleep safe at night

01:05:49.321 --> 01:05:52.074
knowing he'll never have
to see the shit we do?

01:05:56.703 --> 01:05:58.455
We're just taking things
into our own hands.

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:01.500
Looking after our own.

01:06:04.795 --> 01:06:05.796
Is that really so bad?

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:09.299
You've got no honor.

01:06:10.342 --> 01:06:12.302
Is honor gonna keep
your dad warm this winter?

01:06:13.429 --> 01:06:15.055
Is it gonna clothe
your children?

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:18.434
Is it gonna pay your
fuckin' electricity bills?

01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:28.944
Honor is the lie
they sell to you,

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:33.073
beat into you, all so
you'll fight tooth and nail

01:06:33.282 --> 01:06:36.785
to protect the status quo
so they can stay rich

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:38.579
and you can stay expendable.

01:06:39.413 --> 01:06:41.290
And when you're too old
to fight anymore,

01:06:41.665 --> 01:06:45.210
they slap a little badge on ya
and tell you it's for honor.

01:06:47.129 --> 01:06:48.505
And then they leave you to rot.

01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:58.849
I can offer you
something better.

01:07:00.809 --> 01:07:02.853
I can change your family's
whole lives.

01:07:13.739 --> 01:07:15.574
There's plenty more
where this came from.

01:07:18.202 --> 01:07:21.038
All you gotta do is show us
where Noah and the chips are.

01:07:22.247 --> 01:07:25.792
We'll go and you can live
happily ever after.

01:07:44.978 --> 01:07:47.145
I've got a call to make.
Get this gold moved over.

01:07:47.147 --> 01:07:48.732
We'll have the chips
in the next 10.

01:08:11.213 --> 01:08:11.964
It's me.

01:08:12.798 --> 01:08:13.757
Amir's dead.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.468
<i>Then the deal is off.</i>

01:08:16.635 --> 01:08:17.301
No, wait.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.555
Still got the chips
and the missiles.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.975
No need to tank a good deal
over one dead middleman.

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:28.479
<i>Okay.</i>

01:08:29.231 --> 01:08:30.314
<i>Come alone,
or there is no deal.</i>

01:08:34.987 --> 01:08:35.737
But my squad...

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:38.073
<i>I lose men,
you should lose men.</i>

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:40.701
<i>You want the money,
then you have a deal,</i>

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:43.495
<i>but come alone
or don't come at all.</i>

01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:48.018
Where?

01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.978
I don't know.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:52.481
I didn't come in here with him.

01:09:56.026 --> 01:10:00.197
If you're fucking with me,
I'll put a bullet in your head.

01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:02.866
Right here.

01:10:32.312 --> 01:10:33.063
Noah?

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:38.276
Look, just come out.

01:10:39.111 --> 01:10:39.820
Mm?

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:42.656
You can't win this.

01:10:45.784 --> 01:10:46.410
Look.

01:10:48.078 --> 01:10:49.204
Let us help you.

01:10:51.498 --> 01:10:52.541
We don't wanna have to kill you

01:10:52.791 --> 01:10:54.751
any more than you wanna kill us.

01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:56.253
I am more than willing

01:10:56.503 --> 01:10:57.003
to kill you.

01:12:00.567 --> 01:12:02.027
She got away with the case.

01:12:05.322 --> 01:12:06.823
She's got the chips, it's over.

01:12:21.213 --> 01:12:21.838
No.

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:24.174
It's not over.

01:12:27.886 --> 01:12:31.306
My grandfather would have
given his life for honor.

01:12:32.766 --> 01:12:35.769
So would my father,
and so will I.

01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:42.234
These tunnels, they lead
straight to the storage hanger.

01:12:43.735 --> 01:12:44.528
We can still stop them.

01:12:54.621 --> 01:12:56.039
You're fucking crazy,
you Gurkhas.

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:56.998
You know that, right?

01:12:58.375 --> 01:12:59.125
Yeah.

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:00.836
We know.

01:13:28.113 --> 01:13:28.947
Bartlett!

01:13:36.121 --> 01:13:36.913
You're injured.

01:13:38.832 --> 01:13:39.583
Yeah.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:41.835
And they killed Trevors.

01:13:43.128 --> 01:13:43.879
I can see that.

01:13:45.088 --> 01:13:46.047
Those the chips?

01:13:47.549 --> 01:13:48.049
Yeah.

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:49.259
All of them?

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:51.303
Yeah, I think so.

01:13:53.221 --> 01:13:54.973
Thank fuck for that.

01:13:57.559 --> 01:13:58.268
Can you drive?

01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:03.106
Yeah.

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:21.374
Where's Sage?

01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:22.709
Oh, yeah.

01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:24.044
I killed him.

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:56.034
Last one.

01:14:59.204 --> 01:15:00.121
Don't miss.

01:15:01.289 --> 01:15:02.040
I won't.

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:09.673
Don't shoot me either.

01:15:11.883 --> 01:15:12.676
I'll do me best.

01:15:40.704 --> 01:15:41.663
Fuck sake.

01:15:55.969 --> 01:15:57.387
Looks like
our deal's off then, eh?

01:16:27.375 --> 01:16:28.126
Come on, boys.

01:16:29.544 --> 01:16:31.046
Let's not play hide and seek.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:37.343
We can handle this like men.

01:18:40.175 --> 01:18:41.050
Look at you both.

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:46.639
You're about to die in
the middle of fucking nowhere.

01:18:47.432 --> 01:18:48.141
For what?

01:19:58.753 --> 01:20:00.546
You know, I don't take
any pleasure from this.

01:20:13.393 --> 01:20:14.727
You should've taken the gold.

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:41.546
Why don't you just give up?

01:20:44.507 --> 01:20:47.135
Because I've got honor.

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:48.423
Thank you.

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:53.803
You didn't have to do
any of this.

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:00.101
Yes.

01:23:03.104 --> 01:23:03.771
I did.

01:23:32.175 --> 01:23:32.758
We good?

01:23:33.259 --> 01:23:34.427
Give us a second, lads, yeah?

01:23:59.118 --> 01:24:00.161
Well, that's it, then.

01:24:02.497 --> 01:24:03.080
That's it.

01:24:04.624 --> 01:24:05.208
I guess.

01:24:06.834 --> 01:24:08.044
You sure you don't wanna
come with us?

01:24:08.753 --> 01:24:10.087
Get some
proper medical attention?

01:24:18.638 --> 01:24:19.263
Well...

01:24:21.682 --> 01:24:24.101
I suggest you check under
your mattress after we leave.

01:24:24.769 --> 01:24:25.436
Why is that?

01:24:27.104 --> 01:24:27.688
Just do it.

01:24:32.902 --> 01:24:34.195
You're not gonna try
and kiss me now, are ya?

01:24:55.341 --> 01:24:56.175
Captain Brand.

01:24:58.177 --> 01:24:59.428
I need to ask you
some questions.

01:25:00.137 --> 01:25:00.888
Yes, sir.

01:25:18.948 --> 01:25:20.283
The gold in the back
of the truck.

01:25:21.701 --> 01:25:25.037
The initial Intel we had,
there should've been a few more.

01:25:26.706 --> 01:25:28.249
Did a full sweep of the area.

01:25:31.168 --> 01:25:32.253
Couldn't find anything.

01:25:35.089 --> 01:25:36.048
Do you know anything about that?

01:25:38.217 --> 01:25:39.176
No, sir.

01:25:40.511 --> 01:25:41.137
Not a thing.
