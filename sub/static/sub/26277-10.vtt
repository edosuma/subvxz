WEBVTT

00:00.267 --> 00:01.768
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:03.370 --> 00:07.040
You've all been missing,
presumed dead, for 5 1/2 years.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.510
Who is she?
Lourdes.

00:12.312 --> 00:14.581
The government didn't release
all the passengers.

00:14.581 --> 00:16.750
I think they're experimenting
on these people,

00:16.750 --> 00:20.053
and Cal is somehow channeling
what they're going through.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.688
I still feel them.

00:25.826 --> 00:29.196
I found a remote property.
I'm going to take them there.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.764
They'll be safe with me.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.934
Just get him to trust you.
Be specific, but nothing useful.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.871
Olive's not my kid. But I
stepped in when you were gone.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.207
When she comes to me,
I-I can't turn her away.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.209
I thought that we
could just start over

00:42.209 --> 00:44.011
right where we left off.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.345
I don't know you.

00:45.345 --> 00:48.549
I don't think
this is right anymore.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.718
Find out why
he's looking into us,

00:51.718 --> 00:54.388
what he knows,
and who he's working with.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.456
Is that perfectly clear?

00:56.456 --> 00:58.325
Yeah.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.131
I miss you so much, Mom.

01:07.834 --> 01:11.138
Everything has been such a mess
since we got back.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.010
It was supposed to be
happily ever after.

01:17.010 --> 01:22.149
But after 5 1/2 years, you can't
just pick up where you left off.

01:27.654 --> 01:30.590
Everyone moved on.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.326
Except us.

01:34.962 --> 01:37.531
So now we start over.

01:37.531 --> 01:40.767
The government thinks
we're criminals.

01:40.767 --> 01:44.538
Other people think
we're angels, or saints...

01:47.874 --> 01:50.544
...or guinea pigs
to be experimented on.

01:54.247 --> 01:58.151
Innocent people
are getting hurt.

01:58.151 --> 02:00.153
Jared almost died.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.291
What kind of cop am I

02:04.291 --> 02:08.462
if I can't protect
the people that I love?

02:08.462 --> 02:11.932
What kind of person am I...

02:11.932 --> 02:16.937
if I love a man
who can't love me back?

02:16.937 --> 02:19.172
"All good things."

02:20.040 --> 02:23.777
What I would do to hear you
say that one more time.

02:23.777 --> 02:27.147
I wouldn't say I don't believe.
I would say that I want to.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.483
Because there has
got to be a reason

02:29.483 --> 02:33.086
this is happening to us.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.389
I don't know what it is.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.493
But I know one thing.

02:41.361 --> 02:43.730
I want my life back.

03:16.129 --> 03:19.800
Help! Help! Help!

03:26.606 --> 03:29.543
-What's wrong?
-They all jerked.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.812
All at the same time.
Like fingers in a light socket.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.847
It was freaky.

03:33.847 --> 03:34.848
Are you sure?

03:34.848 --> 03:36.383
Um, yeah.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.486
Like that.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.557
Could be a reflex.

03:43.557 --> 03:47.294
It could be, uh, residual brain
trauma from the experiments.

03:47.294 --> 03:49.596
But all at once?

03:50.597 --> 03:53.266
It -- It's like
they're still connected.

03:53.266 --> 03:55.302
We need to bring
the passengers together.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.771
Analyze their experiences.
And warn them.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.039
191 passengers?

03:59.039 --> 04:00.874
At least the ones that
were drawn to the airport

04:00.874 --> 04:01.775
when the plane exploded.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.743
Do you think
they'll cooperate?

04:03.743 --> 04:06.580
I mean, if seeing what happened
to their fellow passengers

04:06.580 --> 04:08.982
doesn't convince people
to stick together...

04:10.250 --> 04:12.319
These were
the low-hanging fruit.

04:12.319 --> 04:14.654
Any single one of us
could be next.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.855
Michaela: Whoa! Hey!

04:48.855 --> 04:50.891
This is my apartment,
remember?

04:50.891 --> 04:53.260
If anyone has dibs
to trash it, it's me.

04:53.260 --> 04:57.230
There's got to be an answer
here. I just don't see it.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.032
I'm sorry.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.668
Where'd you go?
I went to go see Mom.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.703
I gave her
quite the earful.

05:03.703 --> 05:07.073
She was always
the best listener.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.909
Did it help?

05:08.909 --> 05:11.945
It felt good to be there.
To do something.

05:11.945 --> 05:15.081
Yeah. Tell me about it.
I'm going out of my mind here.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.317
All I want to do is protect
Grace and the kids,

05:17.317 --> 05:18.752
and now I can't even
be with them.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.420
Grace is gonna
take you back.

05:20.420 --> 05:24.691
If I can just put this to bed,
life goes back to normal.

05:24.691 --> 05:29.462
It has been 10 days.
No callings.

05:29.462 --> 05:30.764
Maybe it's over.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.966
Maybe the lab explosion
reset everything.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.301
You really believe that?

05:34.301 --> 05:35.936
I want to, yeah.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.838
It's better than
letting it drive me crazy.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.006
Meaning what I'm doing?

05:40.006 --> 05:41.541
You said it, not me.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.379
-Hey, where are you going?
-It's Vance's memorial today.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.014
Michaela: What, you think it's
a good idea to go to that?

05:48.014 --> 05:51.351
I'll keep a low profile.
And I got to pay my respects.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.620
He died helping us.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.621
And?

05:54.621 --> 05:56.690
And maybe
I'll get a lead.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.160
Come on. Isn't it Cop 101 -- go
to the murder victim's funeral,

06:00.160 --> 06:01.494
look for a guilty killer?

06:01.494 --> 06:03.830
Not quite like that.
And you're not a cop.

06:03.830 --> 06:06.666
No, but I'm a dad,
and I've got to protect my son.

06:06.666 --> 06:08.134
Cal channeled Marko.

06:08.134 --> 06:11.638
Cal found the detainees
under that warehouse.

06:11.638 --> 06:14.541
My kid is at the center
of everything happening to us.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.611
I've got to know why.
It just...

06:17.611 --> 06:19.913
It just might
save his life.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.331
You almost died.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.367
You could
take another week off.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.868
I feel great.

06:44.437 --> 06:47.607
As in great great?

06:47.607 --> 06:49.743
Pretty damn good.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.646
Well, I know another way that
we can beat the boredom.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.681
And it doesn't involve
going to work.

06:54.681 --> 06:55.882
Hmm.

06:55.882 --> 06:58.551
And not to kill the mood,
but I'm ovulating.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.889
Or not.

07:02.889 --> 07:05.925
Look, after everything
I went through, I just...

07:05.925 --> 07:09.095
I just need a beat, okay,
just to get my bearings back.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.097
-That's it.
-Mm, babe, I get it.

07:11.097 --> 07:15.135
No pressure. We got
all the time in the world.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.504
-Mm.
-Thank you.

07:29.783 --> 07:34.187
Frozen waffles.
This is bad.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.823
They still taste good.

07:36.823 --> 07:38.992
She's in a dark place.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.161
She misses Dad.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.596
Don't you?

07:43.596 --> 07:46.299
Of course.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.834
Grace: Here you go.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.269
A little bit crispy,

07:49.269 --> 07:51.771
but nothing some extra
maple syrup won't hide.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.373
Thanks, Mom.
Yeah, I've got to go.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.709
I have this, like,
study thing before school.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.712
-See ya.
-Oh.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.413
Why can't Dad come home?

08:04.918 --> 08:07.887
He just needs some time
to take care of some things.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.657
And we agreed that
it'd be best to do them

08:10.657 --> 08:12.926
while he was living
with your Auntie Mick.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.864
Don't eat that.

08:19.265 --> 08:21.468
How about smoothies
on the way to school?

08:21.468 --> 08:22.869
Sure.

08:34.514 --> 08:39.619
An esteemed NSA Deputy Director,
a man of honor and dignity,

08:39.619 --> 08:44.057
Robert Vance died as he lived --
in service of our great country,

08:44.057 --> 08:47.160
uncovering a domestic terror
cell's bomb-making operation

08:47.160 --> 08:49.162
in Red Hook.

08:49.162 --> 08:52.665
Our heartfelt condolences to
Estelle and the Vance children,

08:52.665 --> 08:54.634
as well as Bobby's friends.

08:54.634 --> 08:57.137
Bobby wasn't
a particularly social man,

08:57.137 --> 09:01.007
eschewing small talk,
but anyone who knew him

09:01.007 --> 09:03.343
saw that the loyalty
he showed this country

09:03.343 --> 09:06.446
could only be matched
by his devotion to his friends

09:06.446 --> 09:08.081
and especially family.

09:08.081 --> 09:11.718
Bobby's father
fought and died in Vietnam.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.954
When I met Bobby,
the first story he told me

09:14.954 --> 09:16.856
was of his devoted mother...

09:16.856 --> 09:19.392
You have some nerve
showing up here.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.660
You got him killed.

09:20.660 --> 09:21.928
Look, I don't know
what you think --

09:21.928 --> 09:24.464
Show some respect
and leave.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.339
Hey.
Ben Stone, right?

09:33.339 --> 09:36.776
Don't tell me you believe
that story about mad bombers.

09:36.776 --> 09:38.745
We both know
it's not true.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.880
I'm Aaron Glover.
I'm a journalist.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.449
My podcast is "828-Gate."

09:42.449 --> 09:44.050
Podcast.
That's still a thing?

09:44.050 --> 09:46.219
Yeah, it's very much a thing.
You should have a listen.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.420
Nope. No comment.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.689
You can't stop me from reporting
that I saw you here.

09:49.689 --> 09:51.324
And having a moment
with Agent Powell.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.226
You seem to be pretty cozy
with the NSA.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.928
My listeners
are gonna wonder why.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.329
Say what you want
about the government.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.364
But I'm a private citizen.
Keep me out of your story.

09:58.364 --> 09:59.532
You are the story.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.000
Look, I don't know you,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.069
I don't know your podcast,
but you're wasting your time.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.238
I've got nothing for you.
Maybe I have something for you.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.006
Why did a chopper
drop off the Major

10:07.006 --> 10:08.374
at that factory in Red Hook

10:08.374 --> 10:11.010
an hour before
the whole thing goes boom?

10:14.447 --> 10:16.216
Major who?

10:16.216 --> 10:19.452
I don't know, but whoever it was
is still out there.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.887
Still a threat.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.188
What can you
do about it?

10:22.188 --> 10:23.590
You need allies,
and I can deliver them.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.058
Just give me a statement.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.893
What, and blow up my life
to launch your career?

10:26.893 --> 10:28.394
No, thanks.
You know...

10:28.394 --> 10:29.929
check out the podcast.

10:29.929 --> 10:32.298
You'll see --
I want to do this right.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.770
Did you reach all 20?

10:37.770 --> 10:41.674
18, minus Harvey and Kelly.

10:41.674 --> 10:43.109
Uh, most of them
can make it.

10:43.109 --> 10:44.944
Thanks for getting here
so quickly.

10:44.944 --> 10:47.113
Ben's right behind me.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.084
I recognize this guy
from the airport.

10:51.084 --> 10:54.420
Yeah. Paul Santino.
He's a local.

10:54.420 --> 10:58.391
His wife was a no-show
at the hangar.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.460
Abandoned.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.795
You and me both, buddy.

11:02.795 --> 11:05.865
Find her.

11:07.333 --> 11:11.237
Are you okay? Michaela?
Did you just have a calling?

11:14.941 --> 11:17.310
Yeah, but that was not
like the other ones.

11:17.310 --> 11:21.381
I was transported to a blizzard,
and I heard, "Find her."

11:28.488 --> 11:30.523
What did you do to him?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.125
I don't know.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.671
Yeah, I don't -- I don't --
I don't understand.

11:44.671 --> 11:47.440
What -- What is this place?
Who are you people?

11:50.743 --> 11:53.179
Do you remember a plane?

11:53.179 --> 11:54.981
-Do you know what year it is?
-What happened to me?

11:54.981 --> 11:56.349
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.251
What is the last thing
that you remember, Paul?

11:58.251 --> 11:59.919
Is that my name?

11:59.919 --> 12:02.589
Paul Santino.
You have a wife -- Helen.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.657
I'm married?

12:04.657 --> 12:06.426
That, uh...

12:06.426 --> 12:08.795
That doesn't --
doesn't feel right.

12:08.795 --> 12:11.230
Are you sure?

12:11.230 --> 12:13.466
You know what?
I'll double-check.

12:23.643 --> 12:27.046
Sounds like
complete amnesia.

12:27.046 --> 12:30.216
Probably happened with
the electro-shock tests.

12:30.216 --> 12:34.253
Can we try to see if you
can wake up another one?

12:34.253 --> 12:36.089
I'm not magic, Saanvi.
I know.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.591
I have been trying
around the clock to help them.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.394
Nothing is working.
I would be crazy not to try.

12:45.865 --> 12:47.767
Hey, Marko.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.975
Marko?

12:55.975 --> 12:57.443
See? I am not magic.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.580
Could be a coincidence.
Or neuroplasticity.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.750
Their catatonia
could be the body's way

13:03.750 --> 13:08.254
of forcing the brain to rest
and rebuild neural pathways.

13:08.254 --> 13:10.390
Heal themselves.
You're the doctor.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.593
Okay, so I should be able to do
more than just keep them alive.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.695
Maybe that is exactly what
you are supposed to be doing --

13:15.695 --> 13:16.996
giving them time to heal.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.799
They will wake up
when they're ready.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.602
Or when
they're called.

13:22.602 --> 13:26.472
You have to find her.
Paul's wife -- Helen.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.741
Maybe. I've been wrong
about the callings before.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.343
You two share
the same story.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.512
His wife didn't show up
to the hangar.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.546
Neither did Jared.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.315
Maybe you two are connected.
I don't know.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.750
There's got to be a reason
why he woke up just now,

13:37.750 --> 13:39.018
even if we can't see it.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.920
It's like the boy
with Evie's heart.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.056
I think you're
supposed to help Paul.

13:45.591 --> 13:46.859
Bethany: Everywhere I go,

13:46.859 --> 13:48.995
those crazy cult people
are watching me.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.863
They were waiting for me
outside the court

13:50.863 --> 13:52.265
the minute I made bail!

13:52.265 --> 13:55.201
Has anyone else had contact
with the Believers?

13:55.201 --> 13:58.037
Finally someone
taking charge.

13:58.037 --> 14:00.206
Maybe you can help me
get my life back, too.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.275
I went from entrepreneur
wunderkind to out on my ass.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.478
Hang on, Adrian. We're all
on the same side here.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.581
Now, you all showed up
when the plane exploded,

14:08.581 --> 14:12.351
so we know you've had strange
experiences since we landed.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.554
Has anyone had one
in the last 10 days?

14:14.554 --> 14:17.957
-A vision, maybe?
-You know something we don't.

14:17.957 --> 14:21.127
Today something
happened to me. I --

14:21.127 --> 14:24.430
It was like I was transported
into a snowstorm.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.766
-Okay. What does that mean?
-We don't know.

14:26.766 --> 14:30.970
But what we are sure of is that
we have to share information.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.939
But what good
will that do?

14:32.939 --> 14:34.440
It might just
save your lives.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.144
As some of you know,
I study shared consciousness,

14:38.144 --> 14:40.980
like the callings
you've all experienced.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.050
I don't think it was an accident
I was on that flight with you.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.819
I think I was there
to be an interpreter.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.488
You're all welcome here.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.424
A friend of mine lent me the use
of this place until the spring.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.159
She studies
"shared consciousness"

14:53.159 --> 14:54.660
and just happens
to be on the plane?

14:54.660 --> 14:55.928
Coincidences happen.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.331
So do conspiracies.
Think about it.

14:58.331 --> 15:02.235
What if this whole thing is
her twisted science experiment?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.437
She's been a help to us.
Well, sure she has.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.572
She's trying to get you
to trust her.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.707
It has to stop.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.309
Things can't fall
into the wrong hands.

15:10.309 --> 15:13.312
Things? Captain, if you know
something that can help --

15:13.312 --> 15:14.881
Maybe I do,
and maybe I don't.

15:14.881 --> 15:17.717
But whatever's going on,
I'm gonna figure it out alone.

15:17.717 --> 15:20.119
You don't have to. Let me --
Look, you weren't
in that cockpit.

15:20.119 --> 15:22.789
No one's blaming you for
what happened to MA 828.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.791
You can't help me.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.393
Coming here
was a waste of time.

15:37.003 --> 15:39.972
Sorry.
I wasn't eavesdropping.

15:39.972 --> 15:43.943
I mean, I was,
but he seemed so aggro.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.780
Yeah, at the farm,
do you remember

15:47.780 --> 15:51.017
ever coming across
someone called the Major?

15:54.720 --> 15:56.489
Is that a yes?

15:56.489 --> 15:58.191
I-I overheard them
on speakerphone

15:58.191 --> 15:59.959
talking to someone
they called Major.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.829
Laurence was scared,
like the way you are

16:02.829 --> 16:05.331
with someone who's
way more powerful than you are.

16:05.331 --> 16:09.202
He was apologetic,
asking for more money.

16:09.202 --> 16:12.205
The Major said
money wasn't a problem.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.974
"The Holy Grail
is priceless."

16:14.974 --> 16:16.275
Holy Grail?

16:16.275 --> 16:19.812
I remember 'cause it was
a weird thing to say.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.848
No clue what it meant.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.249
Ah.

16:23.249 --> 16:27.520
Whatever the Major's
looking for, she wants it. Bad.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.455
She?

16:29.455 --> 16:32.758
Michaela's calling.
"Find her."

16:32.758 --> 16:35.228
Are you positive
the Major is a woman?

16:35.228 --> 16:38.064
Yeah.
That a big deal?

16:39.198 --> 16:42.068
It just might be.
Thank you.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.528
Where'd you go?

17:09.528 --> 17:12.265
You're not dead.
You're not in jail.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.734
Come on. You got to be
out there somewhere.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.369
Right here, actually.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.241
Not me
you were looking for?

17:22.241 --> 17:25.444
I didn't expect you
to be back to work so soon.

17:28.948 --> 17:31.651
You know, you could've milked
the "almost died" thing

17:31.651 --> 17:33.119
for way more sick days.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.288
Doc gave me
the green light.

17:35.288 --> 17:40.326
And, uh, I wanted
to talk to you.

17:40.326 --> 17:43.396
Later, okay? I'm hot on
this missing-persons thing.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.765
It's the wife
of one of the detainees.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.569
Riojas signed off
on me investigating it.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.373
Okay.
Bring me up to speed.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.409
Uh, he's an attorney,
serious money.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.611
Looks like she lost everything
after 828.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.346
Last known address
that we have

18:00.346 --> 18:02.148
is some crappy street
in Astoria.

18:02.148 --> 18:03.382
-Social media?
-Zero presence.

18:03.382 --> 18:04.884
She didn't come
to the hangar.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.986
I mean, everything that I found
suggests a loving couple.

18:06.986 --> 18:10.589
So...why didn't she show?

18:11.791 --> 18:13.893
You think something
happened to her.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.429
I don't know what to think.
She...vanished.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.230
Let's go find her.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.738
Surprise.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.908
Now, there's a face
I've missed.
Same.

18:28.908 --> 18:32.445
How about I cancel my bike ride
and we can hit the climbing gym?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.214
One step closer
to Acadia.

18:35.214 --> 18:36.916
Or you could come see us.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.652
Olive, I-I'd love that,
but it's really up to your mom.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.921
She's not gonna ask.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.389
I can tell she misses you,

18:43.389 --> 18:45.891
but it's like
she's punishing herself.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.660
Give her time to process.

18:47.660 --> 18:51.464
Well, it's like
they died all over again.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.666
She's barely smiling.
She's not eating.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.902
Seeing her like that messed me
up more than the plane,

18:56.902 --> 18:58.137
and I can't do it again.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.772
And I don't want you to.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.241
Then if you
still love us...

19:06.112 --> 19:08.848
...help me help her.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.282
Please.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.819
Aaron: During the 5 1/2 years
the plane was missing,

19:13.819 --> 19:15.654
the flight path,
weather pattens,

19:15.654 --> 19:17.857
and telemetry
have been exhaustively studied.

19:17.857 --> 19:21.861
The NTSB report took 18 months.
And it's full of holes.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.830
But I'm not giving up.
I'll find the truth.

19:33.639 --> 19:36.075
Oh...hi.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.209
Hi.

19:37.209 --> 19:38.711
I thought
I had them today.

19:38.711 --> 19:42.381
Uh, Cal asked me to come.
I figured he told you.

19:43.315 --> 19:45.618
Oh. No.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.253
Cal: Dad!

19:47.253 --> 19:48.754
Hey, buddy.

19:48.754 --> 19:51.857
How was school?

19:51.857 --> 19:54.560
Good. Uh, come on.
I've been working on my shot.

19:55.327 --> 19:57.596
Almost.
Use your legs.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.832
Why won't Mom
let you come home?

19:59.832 --> 20:02.334
Mom's not keeping me away,
buddy.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.403
There's just things
I got to take care of.

20:04.403 --> 20:05.771
Things to
keep us all safe.

20:05.771 --> 20:09.008
I know. But why can't you
do any of that here?

20:09.008 --> 20:11.510
I wish I could, buddy.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.446
Hey.

20:13.446 --> 20:16.949
Mom and I both
love you a ton.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.217
Two tons.

20:19.785 --> 20:22.321
Two tons of love weighs the same
as two tons of rocks.

20:22.321 --> 20:23.789
So basically,
you're crushing me.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.658
You want to crush this ball?

20:25.658 --> 20:28.461
-Yeah.
-Crush it. Crush it!

20:35.701 --> 20:37.369
I'm Aaron Glover,

20:37.369 --> 20:39.872
and that's all for this week's
episode of "828-Gate,"

20:39.872 --> 20:42.174
but you don't want to miss
next week's episode,

20:42.174 --> 20:45.911
"Chapter Six: Closing in
on the Holy Grail."

20:48.981 --> 20:50.616
...next week's episode,

20:50.616 --> 20:54.386
"Chapter Six: Closing in
on the Holy Grail."

20:55.721 --> 20:58.224
Aaron: Glad you
decided to trust me.

20:58.224 --> 21:01.227
I haven't -- yet.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.963
But answer my questions,
and I might.

21:03.963 --> 21:07.700
What did you mean
by "The Holy Grail"?

21:07.700 --> 21:10.236
Just something
a confidential source said.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.938
Not good enough.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.340
I won't name names.

21:14.340 --> 21:18.644
Right after 828 returned,
Senate Intelligence Committee,

21:18.644 --> 21:22.681
House Appropriations started
having secret meetings.

21:22.681 --> 21:26.785
In which they earmarked millions
to preserve the phantom shiner.

21:26.785 --> 21:27.787
It's a fish.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.588
Hasn't been seen
since the 1940s,

21:29.588 --> 21:32.525
so why earmark funds?

21:32.525 --> 21:35.427
To pay for
a clandestine operation.

21:35.427 --> 21:36.695
Look at you.

21:36.695 --> 21:38.731
But all my source had
was a fragment

21:38.731 --> 21:40.900
of a conversation
he overheard.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.702
A senator said,
"It's the Holy Grail.

21:43.702 --> 21:47.273
We have to be the first,
or 828 blows up in our face."

21:47.273 --> 21:48.574
The Holy Grail?

21:48.574 --> 21:50.142
You think that's what
the Major's looking for?

21:50.142 --> 21:52.711
No, not literally.
This isn't Arthurian legend.

21:52.711 --> 21:55.548
But it's something big.

21:55.548 --> 21:56.982
It's time
to go on the record.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.819
Not yet.
We're still on background.

22:00.819 --> 22:03.222
But I will
tell you this --

22:03.222 --> 22:06.292
the Major on that chopper
was a woman.

22:06.292 --> 22:09.195
-What's her name?
-Don't know yet.

22:09.195 --> 22:11.897
The chopper could lead us to it.
I'm assuming you traced it.

22:11.897 --> 22:13.899
My source told me it was
a military Black Hawk.

22:13.899 --> 22:17.203
We need Intel access.
CIA, NSA.

22:17.203 --> 22:18.871
Powell.
Vance's deputy.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.506
-Can you trust him?
-Oh, hardly.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.908
But I trust his loyalty
to Vance.

22:22.908 --> 22:28.080
The thing is, I'll never get
through the NSA's front door.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.917
But your sources could find me
a side entrance.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.468
Michaela:
That's not a good sign.

22:49.468 --> 22:51.437
Hello? NYPD.

22:59.278 --> 23:00.646
Newspapers, mail.

23:00.646 --> 23:03.215
This isn't looking
like a planned vacation.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.986
I do not want to know what it
looks like inside that carton.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.821
November 6th.

23:08.821 --> 23:11.023
That's two days
after 828 returned.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.292
Causing her to leave
in a hurry?
Yeah, or taken.

23:13.292 --> 23:16.428
Maybe the same people
who took Paul took Helen.

23:16.428 --> 23:17.763
I have to find her.

23:17.763 --> 23:20.165
You had a calling,
didn't you?

23:20.165 --> 23:21.967
When? What was it?

23:21.967 --> 23:24.503
Are you reading
my mind now?

23:24.503 --> 23:27.306
I know you, Mick.

23:27.306 --> 23:31.076
I need to go back to the
beach house and see Paul again.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.111
Try and jog his memory.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.879
Maybe he remembers
relatives or friends

23:33.879 --> 23:36.081
who might be able to help.
Yeah. Okay. Let's go.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.716
Why don't you stay here
and search the place?

23:37.716 --> 23:39.385
Maybe start with the mail.

23:39.385 --> 23:41.587
Are you trying
to ditch me now?

23:41.587 --> 23:44.156
Paul's delicate.
It's better if I go it alone.

23:48.827 --> 23:50.929
Paul:
I don't recognize her.

23:53.032 --> 23:55.534
How can I not remember
my own wife?

23:57.036 --> 23:59.505
What happened to me?

23:59.505 --> 24:02.441
I just want
my life back.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.710
Believe me, I know.

24:17.956 --> 24:20.726
Listen, we're gonna
find her, okay?

24:20.726 --> 24:23.195
And I'm sure once you see her,
it'll all come back.

24:25.497 --> 24:28.100
Find her.

24:28.100 --> 24:31.236
Find her.

24:31.236 --> 24:33.005
It just happened again.

24:33.005 --> 24:36.542
Yeah. But these callings
are so different, Ben.

24:36.542 --> 24:38.210
I thought it was
about the words,

24:38.210 --> 24:40.980
but the blizzard, the wind,
it just -- it feels more vital.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.848
Like it's not just
about finding Helen.

24:42.848 --> 24:44.550
I don't know
what the snow means,

24:44.550 --> 24:47.820
but this mystery Major
is a woman.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.722
And we definitely
need to find her.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.824
Maybe Paul's wife
isn't who we're after.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.425
Okay. Until we know
what's going on,

24:53.425 --> 24:54.693
I think we should
look for both.

24:54.693 --> 24:55.861
-Hey.
-Hey, guys.

24:55.861 --> 24:57.863
I got your message.
What's up?

24:57.863 --> 24:59.932
Uh, this is gonna
sound crazy.

24:59.932 --> 25:02.201
I think our operational baseline
is 10 points up from crazy.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.969
Well, this is gonna
turn it up to 11.

25:03.969 --> 25:05.671
Two sources told me
that the Major

25:05.671 --> 25:08.207
is looking for
the Holy Grail.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.709
-Right.
-Yeah, I didn't think so either.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.444
But she's used
the phrase twice,

25:12.444 --> 25:15.314
so it's got to be code
for something specific.

25:15.314 --> 25:16.815
What is she chasing?

25:16.815 --> 25:19.017
Same thing we are.
Answers.

25:19.017 --> 25:21.820
To what's happened,
what's causing the callings,

25:21.820 --> 25:23.088
how to control them.

25:23.088 --> 25:24.757
I'll go through
the lab notes.

25:24.757 --> 25:27.059
Maybe I missed something.
Yeah.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.794
Hey, I got to run.

25:28.794 --> 25:31.730
Jared's got a lead that might
get us to Paul's wife.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.665
And I got a lead
on Powell.

25:33.665 --> 25:35.567
What do you want
from him?

25:35.567 --> 25:39.405
The Major, the Holy Grail.
Where to begin?

25:39.405 --> 25:41.640
Jared: The last charge
on Helen's credit card

25:41.640 --> 25:43.008
was an Uber ride to here.

25:43.008 --> 25:46.145
Clerk ID'd her photo.
Said she was in room 28.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.279
Checked in alone.

25:47.279 --> 25:50.582
So not a kidnapping.
More like she's hiding. Why?

25:58.357 --> 26:00.259
Helen Santino?

26:02.094 --> 26:04.997
NYPD.
Your husband, Paul, sent us.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.300
Gun!

26:08.300 --> 26:11.804
Oh, God. Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

26:16.175 --> 26:19.211
I'm sorry.
I didn't believe you were cops.

26:19.211 --> 26:22.147
I thought Paul sent you
to kill me.

26:22.147 --> 26:23.816
Why would he want
to kill you?

26:23.816 --> 26:26.685
He came close a couple times.
Before.

26:26.685 --> 26:29.388
He was abusive.

26:29.388 --> 26:31.890
Not at first.

26:31.890 --> 26:34.159
But after we were married,
it started.

26:34.159 --> 26:36.028
Said if I'd been
a better wife,

26:36.028 --> 26:37.930
everything would've
been easier.

26:37.930 --> 26:42.501
And I tried. But I could
never be good enough.

26:42.501 --> 26:44.570
None of this is your fault.

26:44.570 --> 26:46.805
I know that now.

26:46.805 --> 26:50.676
Years of therapy,
after he was gone.

26:50.676 --> 26:52.578
When the plane
disappeared.

26:52.578 --> 26:53.846
Answered prayers.

26:53.846 --> 26:56.482
When I found out
the plane was back...

26:56.482 --> 26:59.952
The Paul you knew
wouldn't have been happy.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.621
What do you mean
"the Paul I knew"?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.289
What's going on?

27:04.289 --> 27:05.991
Something happened.

27:05.991 --> 27:09.528
Paul lost his memory.

27:09.528 --> 27:12.331
So he's not coming?
You won't tell him where I am?

27:12.331 --> 27:16.168
Helen, it's over.
You're safe. Okay?

27:16.168 --> 27:18.237
When I got the news
about 828,

27:18.237 --> 27:20.939
I thought I'd never
be happy again.

27:22.274 --> 27:24.877
Paul coming back
was like this wrecking ball

27:24.877 --> 27:27.145
smashing into
everything I'd built.

27:40.692 --> 27:43.295
Hate to ruin
your party of one.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.030
Get the hell
out of here, Stone.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.899
I get it -- you blame me
for Vance's death.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.300
But I didn't
get your boss killed.

27:48.300 --> 27:51.770
Give me five minutes,
and you'll know who did.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.539
One minute.

27:53.539 --> 27:54.840
The Major.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.408
That supposed to
mean something to me?

27:56.408 --> 27:58.410
It's who Vance thought
he was up against.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.546
She's the head of
a covert military operation,

28:00.546 --> 28:02.781
one that's circumventing
the intelligence community.

28:02.781 --> 28:04.116
Deep pockets,
no accountability.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.717
You're not helping
your case, Stone.

28:05.717 --> 28:07.219
I thought you said
you had a name.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.821
I don't.
But you can get one.

28:09.821 --> 28:11.890
Trace a Black Hawk,
based out of D.C.

28:11.890 --> 28:14.393
Flew into Red Hook
an hour before the explosion.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.895
The Major, whoever she is,
was on board.

28:16.895 --> 28:20.766
And she was looking
for something she
calls the Holy Grail.

28:20.766 --> 28:23.702
I need to understand
all this, Powell.

28:23.702 --> 28:28.640
It affects the safety of all
the passengers, of my family.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.709
Please help me.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.280
Your one minute's up.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.849
Whatever you're into,
I want no part of it.

28:37.849 --> 28:40.085
If you're smart,
you'll walk away, too.

28:40.085 --> 28:43.121
No. Vance didn't. He believed
that no one is above the law.

28:43.121 --> 28:46.024
He wanted to help me expose
the truth, wherever it led.

28:46.024 --> 28:48.360
Like I said --
you got him killed.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.828
No, not me. The Major.

28:49.828 --> 28:52.130
And you have a chance
to ID her.

28:56.501 --> 29:01.406
Ask yourself -- what would
Vance want you to do?

29:07.079 --> 29:09.114
Hey!
Hey, what's up with you?

29:09.114 --> 29:11.183
I don't want
to talk about it.

29:11.183 --> 29:14.453
Clearly. You didn't say a word
to me the whole way back.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.154
What's going on?

29:19.324 --> 29:22.828
Why didn't you come to the
hangar when the plane came back?

29:22.828 --> 29:24.563
I'll tell you why --

29:24.563 --> 29:28.200
because I am a giant wrecking
ball smashing into your life.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.435
-Mick.
-Let's not sugarcoat this, Jay.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.204
We owe each other that.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.507
I'm gonna tell the Captain

29:35.507 --> 29:37.242
that I don't want to work
with you anymore.

29:37.242 --> 29:39.244
-What? No.
-You found happiness, Jared.

29:39.244 --> 29:42.514
You deserve it.
I am not blowing that up.

29:51.256 --> 29:53.959
Man: Hey. He's one of them!
It's Adrian.

29:53.959 --> 29:57.496
Excuse me.
Can we touch you?

29:59.531 --> 30:00.799
Please.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.881
Trust me --
this is gonna work.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.749
I totally killed
cooking dinner.

30:17.749 --> 30:20.385
I don't think that
the quality of the food
is gonna be the issue.

30:20.385 --> 30:22.521
Please, me following
in her culinary footsteps

30:22.521 --> 30:23.722
is just the warm-up.

30:23.722 --> 30:26.191
Tonight is gonna be something
that everybody needs.

30:26.191 --> 30:28.860
Did I hear the doorbell?

30:29.761 --> 30:30.762
Hi.

30:30.762 --> 30:32.197
Danny.

30:32.197 --> 30:35.267
Um...this is
not a good time.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.601
No, no.
It's all good, okay?

30:36.601 --> 30:39.838
I invited him over.
Just for dinner.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.606
I made meatloaf.

30:41.606 --> 30:43.075
Olive.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.577
Grace, she's worried about you.
I am too.

30:45.577 --> 30:48.280
No. We're not having
this conversation.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.716
Not now.
Not in front of her.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.217
I think you should go.

30:52.217 --> 30:54.219
-I don't want him to go.
-Olive, this is a family matter.

30:54.219 --> 30:57.022
What the hell, Mom?!
Danny is family!

30:58.957 --> 31:01.993
Olive!

31:13.004 --> 31:16.241
-Did you find her?
-Yeah.

31:16.241 --> 31:19.911
Where is she?
Can I see her?

31:19.911 --> 31:22.681
No. You can't.

31:22.681 --> 31:24.182
I don't understand.

31:24.182 --> 31:26.852
You know, I thought we were
the same, you and me.

31:26.852 --> 31:28.487
Coming back,
being alone.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.723
I felt sorry for you, for me.
But we are not the victims.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.459
We do not get to come
crashing into their lives,
wrecking their happiness.

31:34.459 --> 31:36.328
What? Why would --
Why would I --

31:36.328 --> 31:38.630
You seriously
don't remember, Paul?
Mick. What's wrong?

31:38.630 --> 31:41.032
Or maybe you don't want to
remember what a monster you are.

31:41.032 --> 31:42.534
You beat your wife.
No.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.136
-Michaela.
-You're wrong. I would ne--

31:44.136 --> 31:45.637
-I just want my life back.
-Stop saying that!

31:45.637 --> 31:47.339
-You do not deserve it!
-No, Michaela, stop!

31:47.339 --> 31:48.740
You do not deserve
a damn thing!

31:48.740 --> 31:51.543
Stop it! Geez.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.150
Hey. I got your text.
What's wrong?

31:58.150 --> 31:59.684
Grace:
You are not a grown-up, Olive.

31:59.684 --> 32:02.120
Mom and Olive?
Olive:
You're not acting like one.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.855
Olive, you can't talk
to your mother like that.

32:03.855 --> 32:05.624
Hey.
What are you doing here?

32:05.624 --> 32:06.825
I-I was invited.

32:06.825 --> 32:08.927
Really? 'Cause it doesn't
look like a happy reunion.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.262
-Ben, it's fine.
-It's not.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.831
I am not dead anymore.
I am right here.

32:12.831 --> 32:15.333
And why does he get to be
in my house with my children?

32:15.333 --> 32:17.402
You are the whole reason
this family is messed up.

32:17.402 --> 32:19.805
I'm trying to pick up
the pieces.

32:19.805 --> 32:21.873
-Ben!
-Stop!

32:21.873 --> 32:24.943
All right?
I invited him!

32:24.943 --> 32:26.144
It's my fault.

32:26.144 --> 32:28.680
No, no,
this is not your fault.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.116
This is not your fault.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.151
From the moment
that plane landed,

32:33.151 --> 32:36.288
you wanted to walk back
into this family

32:36.288 --> 32:38.690
like no time had passed.

32:38.690 --> 32:42.294
And I get that,
because for you, it hadn't.

32:44.496 --> 32:49.100
And you wanted the family
that we had built.

32:49.100 --> 32:50.735
And I don't know
what I want.

32:50.735 --> 32:54.239
But no matter what I do, I'm the
bad guy, and I'm tired of it.

32:54.239 --> 32:56.107
So we're not doing this.

32:56.107 --> 32:58.043
I understand.
I-I'll leave.

32:58.043 --> 33:00.078
No, no, no. I'll --

33:05.116 --> 33:08.153
I'm sorry. I never
really understood until now.

33:10.522 --> 33:14.392
I only thought about
how much you got back,

33:14.392 --> 33:17.562
not -- not what you lost.

33:17.562 --> 33:19.497
Olive wants you here.

33:19.497 --> 33:20.999
No. Dad.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.536
It's okay, Ollie.
I'm okay.

33:24.536 --> 33:28.740
You know you're safe here,
buddy, right?

33:28.740 --> 33:30.542
Come here.

33:32.277 --> 33:35.080
I love you guys so much.

33:35.080 --> 33:38.450
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
Promise.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.206
Jared, no. You shouldn't
be here right now.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.241
Stop.
Stop telling me what to do.

34:03.241 --> 34:05.343
Or how I'm
supposed to feel, Mick.

34:05.343 --> 34:08.079
Look, you asked me why
I didn't go to the hangar.

34:08.079 --> 34:10.282
I didn't go because
I knew if I saw you,

34:10.282 --> 34:13.251
I would've never gone home.

34:13.251 --> 34:14.953
Mick, you're not
a wrecking ball.

34:14.953 --> 34:16.121
You're my soul mate.

34:16.121 --> 34:17.255
No, Jared, I'm not.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.658
Yes, you are.

34:19.658 --> 34:22.928
I still wake up expecting
to find you next to me.

34:22.928 --> 34:24.429
Mick, I still look at you,

34:24.429 --> 34:27.399
and the rest of the world
just goes away.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.005
I love you.

34:34.005 --> 34:36.374
It's always been you.

34:38.410 --> 34:41.313
I didn't cheat death
to live a half a life.

34:41.313 --> 34:43.114
Neither did you.

35:26.024 --> 35:29.160
Ugh.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.165
Yeah?

35:34.165 --> 35:36.034
I found the Black Hawk.

35:36.034 --> 35:39.070
It went wheels up at Langley
10 minutes ago on red alert.

35:39.070 --> 35:43.341
It's a VIP transpo, assigned
for someone's personal use.

35:43.341 --> 35:45.944
It's got to be the Major.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.679
You get a name?

35:47.679 --> 35:48.780
Classified.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.682
If they were at Red Hook,

35:50.682 --> 35:54.919
they're likely behind the
explosion that killed my boss.

35:54.919 --> 35:58.490
You asked me
what Vance would do.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.226
He'd want me to help you.

36:01.226 --> 36:03.028
Thank you.

36:03.028 --> 36:04.562
Just watch your six.

36:04.562 --> 36:08.633
The Black Hawk filed
a flight plan -- New York City.

36:08.633 --> 36:13.038
Whoever the Major is,
she's comin'.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.618
Ben:
I don't know her name.

37:00.618 --> 37:02.554
But she knows me and my family.

37:02.554 --> 37:06.524
And it looks like
she's after us.

37:06.524 --> 37:09.627
All we did
was get on a plane.

37:09.627 --> 37:12.864
And because of that, our lives
have never been the same.

37:12.864 --> 37:16.201
Everyone on that flight
got a second chance.

37:16.201 --> 37:19.971
But it came
at a high price.

37:19.971 --> 37:22.474
And now there's a new danger
facing us.

37:22.474 --> 37:26.444
I don't know what Holy Grail
the Major is closing in on.

37:26.444 --> 37:29.581
But I do know this --

37:29.581 --> 37:33.918
I will not let my family be
collateral damage in her quest.

37:38.723 --> 37:41.025
The way you worked in the tag --
brilliant.

37:41.025 --> 37:43.294
My subscribers are gonna
go through the roof.

37:43.294 --> 37:44.763
You can't release it.

37:44.763 --> 37:47.532
Are you crazy?
We've got to go after the Major.

37:47.532 --> 37:50.201
Figure out who she is,
who she's working for.

37:50.201 --> 37:52.036
Prove the government
is lying to us.

37:52.036 --> 37:54.472
This is a huge scoop.
People need to know.

37:54.472 --> 37:56.307
Do it,
follow the trail.

37:56.307 --> 37:58.643
It just can't go public.
Yet.

37:58.643 --> 38:01.012
Then why did you
come to me?

38:02.981 --> 38:04.649
I'm your insurance policy.

38:04.649 --> 38:07.252
If this ends badly,
blow the lid.

38:07.252 --> 38:08.887
And if it doesn't
end badly?

38:08.887 --> 38:11.022
Then you've got
a Deep Throat.

38:11.022 --> 38:13.591
Be patient.

38:13.591 --> 38:16.628
Who knows how high
this all goes.

38:18.963 --> 38:19.931
Danny...

38:19.931 --> 38:21.633
You don't need
to say anything.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.936
If you're ready,
when you're ready --

38:24.936 --> 38:30.275
next week, next month,
next year --

38:30.275 --> 38:31.876
just say the word.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.591
Then we should move the people
to a-a nursing home

38:46.591 --> 38:48.226
-under false names.
-No.

38:48.226 --> 38:51.596
Paul's awakening gave us an
insight into their catatonia.

38:51.596 --> 38:55.833
They were harmed
in service of my theories.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.235
Now we may be close
to a cure.

38:57.235 --> 38:59.103
I will not abandon them
when there's still hope.

38:59.103 --> 39:01.539
Then we need to find a way
to keep you all safe.

39:03.041 --> 39:05.977
Find her.

39:05.977 --> 39:08.613
Find her.

39:08.613 --> 39:10.949
Find her.

39:12.750 --> 39:16.788
-Hey.

39:16.788 --> 39:19.457
The calling again?
"Find her"?

39:19.457 --> 39:21.559
You found Helen.

39:21.559 --> 39:23.995
Now it must be telling you
to find the Major.

39:25.897 --> 39:28.633
I don't think we're
supposed to find anyone.

39:30.401 --> 39:32.704
I think I'm having
someone else's calling.

39:32.704 --> 39:33.905
What do you mean?

39:33.905 --> 39:36.441
The voice in my head.
It's not mine.

39:40.144 --> 39:42.113
What the hell's going on?

40:52.450 --> 40:55.453
Autumn.
What a lovely name.

40:55.453 --> 40:59.490
Your name.
It's on the cup.

40:59.490 --> 41:02.560
Sorry. I didn't mean
to freak on you.

41:02.560 --> 41:05.096
It's just been
a weird day.

41:05.096 --> 41:06.864
I understand.

41:06.864 --> 41:09.100
And I think perhaps
you lost your phone?

41:11.069 --> 41:13.071
No, that's not...

41:15.373 --> 41:17.175
...mine.

41:17.175 --> 41:20.044
It is now.

41:20.044 --> 41:22.280
The Major
would like a word.

41:29.987 --> 41:32.290
I think I found
the Major's Holy Grail.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.791
What? What is it?

41:33.791 --> 41:36.194
No, it's not a what.
It's a who.

41:36.194 --> 41:39.797
These failed experiments
weren't all a complete failure.

41:39.797 --> 41:43.034
The trial was tracking
relative success.

41:43.034 --> 41:45.503
They found that some
of the passengers

41:45.503 --> 41:47.905
are more sensitive
to the callings.

41:50.174 --> 41:51.309
Cal.

41:51.309 --> 41:53.244
If the Major finds out
what he can do...

41:53.244 --> 41:55.480
We got to make sure
she never does.

42:05.490 --> 42:08.092
Find her.
