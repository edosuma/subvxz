<i>- Does everybody know what time it is?
- [all] Tool Time!</i>

00:05.138 --> 00:09.097
That's right. Binford Tools is proud
to present Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor!

00:09.209 --> 00:11.734
[cheering]

00:14.748 --> 00:16.773
Thank you, Heidi.
Thank you, everybody.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.284
<i>Welcome to Tool Time.
l am Tim ''The Tool Man.''</i>

00:19.352 --> 00:22.583
You know this guy sitting next to me.
lt's Al Borland.

00:22.655 --> 00:25.215
[cheering]

00:26.893 --> 00:29.418
l'd like to continue
our week-long salute...

00:29.496 --> 00:31.726
[horn sounds]

00:37.570 --> 00:40.733
...to customizing your car.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.469
Now, if you'll notice,
Tim is wearing a very unique jacket.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.068
lf you'd like to take a turn...

00:46.146 --> 00:48.979
[jazz plays]

00:54.087 --> 00:58.649
Thursday night at a banquet up in
Saginaw, the Tri-City Hot Rodders Club

00:58.725 --> 01:01.626
is giving Tim one
of their most prestigious awards,

01:01.694 --> 01:03.423
Car Guy of the Year.

01:03.496 --> 01:06.056
[applause]

01:10.370 --> 01:13.134
l'm not the kind of guy
that likes to brag.

01:13.206 --> 01:17.438
Aw, heck. Yes, l am. l do significant
things for the auto community.

01:17.510 --> 01:21.037
The Hot Rodders Club is honoring Tim
for raising car consciousness.

01:21.114 --> 01:23.674
<i>l like to build my hot rods
right here on Tool Time.</i>

01:23.750 --> 01:25.843
lt's my way of giving something back.

01:25.919 --> 01:30.356
lt's also your way of getting
Binford to pay for the parts.

01:30.423 --> 01:33.119
And getting free labor from me.

01:33.193 --> 01:34.626
[hisses]

01:34.694 --> 01:38.460
lt's gonna be a great evening. Car guys
from all over are gonna be joining us.

01:38.565 --> 01:41.193
Proceeds from ticket sales
will go right to charity.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.531
Right. l want to take this opportunity

01:43.603 --> 01:47.972
to thank you, Al, for purchasing
that $500 Gold Circle Seat.

01:51.244 --> 01:54.008
[stammering] l didn't buy
the Gold Circle Seat.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.844
lt's being deducted
from your paycheck.

01:58.418 --> 02:02.047
All right. Getting back to the show,
we'll be talking about car interiors.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.455
That's right.
Door panels, dashboards, carpets.

02:05.525 --> 02:08.892
Now, of course, the car seat
is a large part of the interior.

02:08.995 --> 02:11.896
ln Al's case, the seat
is a large part of the exterior.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.693
And here to tell us everything
about car interiors

02:15.768 --> 02:18.635
is the president of the
Tri-City Hot Rodders Club,

02:18.705 --> 02:21.469
- George ''Sparky'' Henderson!
- Bring him on out here!

02:21.574 --> 02:23.667
[applause]

02:26.913 --> 02:29.882
Thank you, Tim. Thank you, guys.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.451
- Thank you.
- Always nice to have you on the show.

02:32.519 --> 02:36.080
Yeah. Thank you very much, Tim.
And Al, l want to really thank you

02:36.156 --> 02:38.716
for buying that Gold Circle Seat
for the banquet.

02:38.791 --> 02:41.419
We never sold one of those before.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.223
Well, actually, l didn't...

02:43.296 --> 02:46.163
Sparky owns one
of Michigan's hot rod detail shops

02:46.232 --> 02:49.360
- that specializes in interiors.
- He's an expert upholsterer.

02:49.435 --> 02:53.929
Well, if l may say so myself,
l'm pretty nimble with a thimble.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.338
- And you just did.
- Thank you, Tim.

02:56.409 --> 02:58.343
What we're doing
is something unusual.

02:58.411 --> 03:01.175
This is five-time
award-winning hot rod, ''The Road Rat.''

03:01.281 --> 03:03.249
- We're gonna reupholster.
- Beauty.

03:03.316 --> 03:05.876
All right, what color seat
would go with this car?

03:05.985 --> 03:08.510
Wrong question here.
What we want to ask ourselves

03:08.588 --> 03:12.547
- is how we coordinate all of the color.
- You gotta think tones and tints,

03:12.625 --> 03:15.253
compromising, contrasting,
complementary colors.

03:15.328 --> 03:17.626
- Think that way.
- What color seat would go

03:17.697 --> 03:20.791
- with this purple car?
- No, see, that's not a purple car, Al.

03:20.867 --> 03:24.928
This is fuchsia. Cream matches up very
well with fuchsia, wouldn't you say?

03:25.004 --> 03:28.337
How about taupe? lt would make
the bills pop out of the dashboard.

03:28.408 --> 03:31.571
Taupe, taupe, taupe.
Yes. Very subtle, very simple. Yes.

03:31.678 --> 03:34.738
- Well, what about black?
- [both] Boring!

03:36.950 --> 03:39.851
- Unless it's a satin black.
- Oh, satin black. All right.

03:39.919 --> 03:41.477
He was thinking that. Or matte.

03:41.588 --> 03:44.352
You know the color l want
to deal with with this car?

03:44.424 --> 03:47.552
We were at the Vegas show?
The hottest color at the Vegas show?

03:47.627 --> 03:50.357
[both] Periwinkle!

03:50.430 --> 03:51.397
Oh!

03:51.497 --> 03:55.934
We'll be back after words from Binford:
tools for men who talk like men.

04:49.989 --> 04:51.752
[Mark] All right! Hole in one!

04:51.824 --> 04:53.485
- Hey, guys.
- [boys] Hi, Dad.

04:53.559 --> 04:56.722
- [Brad] Hey, Dad.
- l told you guys no golf in the house.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.560
At least not until
l get the water hazard put in.

05:01.934 --> 05:03.424
- The mail come?
- Yeah.

05:03.503 --> 05:06.233
Any RSVPs for my awards banquet?

05:06.306 --> 05:09.207
- You got a whole bunch there.
- l only reserved two tables.

05:09.275 --> 05:12.711
Should've known everybody would
pay respects to Car Guy of the Year.

05:14.380 --> 05:19.875
''Unable to attend.''
''Watching TV that night.''

05:19.952 --> 05:22.113
''Call me when you get an Emmy.''

05:24.791 --> 05:26.952
''Don't hold your breath.''
This is terrible.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.029
- What's the matter?
- No one wants to come to my banquet.

05:30.096 --> 05:33.554
So far, the only ''yeses'' are us,
Wilson, Al, Heidi and the boys.

05:33.633 --> 05:36.158
The boys are a ''no.''
lt's a school night.

05:37.637 --> 05:40.401
l'm being crowned
Car Guy of the Year.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.134
Yeah. And we want to honor our father.

05:43.209 --> 05:46.474
l'd love for you guys to go.
We're not gonna get back till 3:00.

05:46.546 --> 05:47.911
You have to go to school.

05:47.980 --> 05:52.144
Well, we want to honor our father so
much, we'd be willing to miss school.

05:53.052 --> 05:55.680
l'd be willing to honor him all week.

05:56.789 --> 05:59.553
She's right. lt's too late for you guys.
You know that.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.828
What's with excuses?
No one wants to show.

06:02.929 --> 06:06.023
Honey, you can't expect people
to drive two hours each way.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.158
That's four hours
in a car on a weeknight.

06:08.234 --> 06:10.361
l'd spend four hours
in a car on a weeknight.

06:10.436 --> 06:13.564
lf it had a bathroom,
you'd live in your car.

06:15.408 --> 06:20.368
There's nothing like a quality cover to
keep your classic car in classic shape.

06:20.446 --> 06:22.311
[theme plays]

06:22.382 --> 06:24.282
- Good show, Al.
- Thank you.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.443
When you fold this,
put it in the back?

06:26.519 --> 06:30.080
Well, are you sure you've got any room
left after all the other free Binford

06:30.189 --> 06:32.248
car products you got?

06:32.325 --> 06:35.021
lt's just a few perks
for getting that award l won again.

06:35.094 --> 06:38.552
What is it again?
Car Guy of the Year.

06:38.631 --> 06:39.598
Hey, everybody!

06:39.699 --> 06:43.658
lf you want to go to a banquet to pay
your respects to The Tool Man,

06:43.736 --> 06:46.432
speak up. They're going fast.
l only got a few left.

06:46.506 --> 06:49.532
Sorry, Tim. l've gotta
rearrange my sock drawer.

06:50.510 --> 06:54.344
That's great. So out of 36 seats,
how many have you got filled?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.314
- A lot.
- Yeah?

06:56.382 --> 06:59.943
A bunch, you know. Some. Six.

07:00.019 --> 07:01.247
- Five.
- Five?

07:01.320 --> 07:04.585
Four. Scott's out of town.
And l'm not driving up without him.

07:04.657 --> 07:07.592
Doesn't matter if your husband can go.
You're The Tool Girl.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.719
- You can go with Jill and me.
- l don't know.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.457
l get tired early these days.

07:11.531 --> 07:16.400
Oh, yeah. l get it. The pregnancy thing
cropping up again. Yeah.

07:16.469 --> 07:20.303
First you couldn't load those sacks
of cement yesterday, and now this.

07:21.808 --> 07:25.972
You don't want to pay respects to the
boss who helped remodel your kitchen?

07:26.045 --> 07:28.809
You set my kitchen on fire.

07:29.816 --> 07:33.274
The boss who gave you medical insurance,
gave you Al's parking spot.

07:33.352 --> 07:37.311
- OK, OK. l'll go.
- That's the spirit!

07:40.126 --> 07:41.650

Well, that's what you
call a real traffic jam.

07:52.572 --> 07:56.064
See my side splitting with that
kind of humor? lt splits right there.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.167
Look at my spleen. Take a look at it.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.804
lf l don't get to the banquet,
l won't accept my award.

08:00.913 --> 08:04.076
Honey, we're in the middle
of an interstate. There's no way out.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.586
When l'm behind the wheel,
there's always a way out.

08:09.589 --> 08:13.548
We can take the shoulder, all right?
Go down that gravel embankment.

08:13.626 --> 08:15.526
That's a riverbed.
We can follow that.

08:15.595 --> 08:18.223
There's a storm tunnel.
We can get through. Home free!

08:18.297 --> 08:20.356
- You can't do that!
- This car can do it!

08:20.433 --> 08:23.698
What about the pregnant woman
in the back?

08:23.769 --> 08:25.600
She'll never notice.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.734
Whoa!

08:36.749 --> 08:39.240
[sighs]

08:39.318 --> 08:42.809
l can't believe you drove
through that field.

08:42.889 --> 08:46.154
That poor cow.

08:46.225 --> 08:48.785
l had no idea they could
jump that high. Did you?

08:48.861 --> 08:51.329
- [Tim mooing]
- Heidi.

08:51.397 --> 08:55.356
- How are you feeling?
- Better than that cow.

08:55.468 --> 08:58.335
lf you want to lay down,
there's a pillow over there.

08:58.404 --> 09:00.736
Thanks, Tim.
That was really thoughtful of you.

09:00.806 --> 09:04.071
He just doesn't want you to drool
on his car-club jacket.

09:05.011 --> 09:08.708
Oh. lt's 20 to eight.
We're gonna miss the film tribute.

- Yeah, it's great.

- l don't know!

09:40.780 --> 09:44.443
Hear that hollow sound?
That's the gas tank. We got no gas.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.016
- The gauge says full.
- The gauge is wrong.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.556
When is the last time you put gas in?
Mileage-wise?

09:51.624 --> 09:53.888
l don't know.
l don't pay attention to mileage.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.326
- l just watch the gauge.
- [grunts]

09:56.395 --> 10:00.729
- You can never trust a gas gauge!
- Well, l guess l know that now!

10:00.800 --> 10:05.703
Do you realize how embarrassing this
is for me? The guy with gas in his veins

10:05.771 --> 10:07.932
has got no gas in his car!

10:11.210 --> 10:12.438
Where are you going?

10:12.511 --> 10:15.378
There's a station two miles back.
l'm gonna go get gas.

10:31.697 --> 10:34.063
- l have no idea.
- l hope everything's all right.

10:34.133 --> 10:38.035
Well, he'd better get here soon.

- They had car trouble.

10:58.290 --> 11:02.750
The Car Guy of the Year had car trouble?
What kind of car trouble?

11:02.828 --> 11:05.262
Uh, Sparky wants
to know what kind of car trouble.

- Yes, he is.

- Hi-ho, neighbor.
- Hi, Wilson.

11:29.755 --> 11:34.021
l'm sorry about that deer. But l do have
some very good animal first-aid tips.

11:34.093 --> 11:37.927
lf it's too late for that, l have
a very tasty recipe for venison.

11:39.365 --> 11:42.425
The deer is resting.
We're gonna be there as soon as we can.

11:42.501 --> 11:46.028
Just give them that message. OK?
Thank you, Wilson.

11:46.105 --> 11:48.039
- [sighs]
- The deer's dead, isn't it?

11:48.107 --> 11:50.837
You can tell me.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.401
Nah. Um, no... That...

Boy, you you look familiar. Did you
ever work at the Aupine Airport?

No. That's my brother Fred.

- Not a chance.

- l am a customer.

- Good. After you pay,

- Fred let me use his restroom.
- Fred's a fool.

with our gas cans.

12:33.185 --> 12:36.154
ls that a big problem, Ned?

12:36.222 --> 12:40.522
No. Who'd give up $1 50
for a gas can?

12:40.593 --> 12:42.356
[Tim laughs]

12:42.461 --> 12:44.554
Uh... Do you take a credit card, Ned?

12:44.630 --> 12:47.497
No. But we've been thinking about it.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.767
l might need a lift
to my car if it's OK.

12:55.841 --> 13:01.677
Well, l could give you one.
But we might suddenly get busy.

13:03.182 --> 13:06.481
And l might suddenly
become a ballet dancer.

13:06.552 --> 13:09.112
Forget it, pal.
You don't have the legs.

13:15.227 --> 13:17.787
- Can l use the restroom now?
- Yeah. lt's over there.

13:17.863 --> 13:21.026
Unfortunately, it's out of order.

13:25.437 --> 13:28.133
[exhales]

13:30.576 --> 13:32.806
You might've mentioned
that to me before.

13:32.878 --> 13:35.403
Why? You weren't a customer then.

13:38.784 --> 13:42.550
- l hope Tim gets back soon.
- Yeah. l'm cold.

13:42.655 --> 13:46.216
- l'll get you a blanket.
- Now l'm hot.

13:46.292 --> 13:48.055
Well, l'll open a window.

13:48.127 --> 13:52.496
No. Wait a minute.
Now l'm not hot and l'm not cold.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.931
So you're comfortable?

13:56.135 --> 13:58.365
Oh, l just had a contraction.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.803
- No.
- Yeah.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.534
- No!
- Oh, yeah.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.906
Oh, my God!

14:06.178 --> 14:09.545
l'm back! l got the gas! We should be
at the banquet in about 25 minutes.

14:09.648 --> 14:12.583
When we get there,
look like we hit a deer. All right?

14:12.651 --> 14:15.085
- [Jill] Tim, guess what?
- What?

14:15.154 --> 14:17.588
- Heidi's having contractions!
- Contractions?

14:17.656 --> 14:19.749
Oh, yeah. Yeah. About 45 minutes.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.086
Are you telling me she
might miss the banquet?

14:24.163 --> 14:27.462
l'm saying forget about the banquet!
She's having a baby!

14:27.533 --> 14:30.400
- We have to get to the hospital.
- [moans]

14:30.469 --> 14:32.437
Oh!

14:33.906 --> 14:37.637
[Jill] Do quick inhales, steady exhale.
Just like they taught you in Lamaze.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.439
They didn't say it would hurt.

14:39.511 --> 14:42.969
Oh, they never do. Otherwise,
nobody would ever have children.

14:44.783 --> 14:48.742
Ah. Hello. l hope you enjoyed the gas.

14:48.854 --> 14:51.220
No time for chitchat.
l have a pregnant woman.

14:51.323 --> 14:53.689
Right next to the deer?

14:55.294 --> 14:58.525
- There is no deer!
- Then maybe there's no pregnant woman.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.399
- [moaning]
- Deer killer!

15:04.136 --> 15:06.195
She's in too much pain
to drive further.

15:06.272 --> 15:08.934
- Oh, boy!
- We've got to get to a hospital.

15:09.008 --> 15:12.944
Hospital's pretty far away. You'd
be better off calling Doc Vandergriff.

15:13.012 --> 15:16.971
- ls he an obstetrician?
- The best. He delivered me.

15:20.886 --> 15:23.354
- How old is he?
- l'm not sure.

15:23.422 --> 15:28.257
But he's very inexpensive. He hasn't
raised his prices since Prohibition.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.831
- l'm calling the hospital.
- [moans]

15:32.932 --> 15:35.765
- l gotta use the restroom.
- lt's out of order.

15:35.834 --> 15:39.326
- Not the ladies' room.
- [moaning]

15:42.808 --> 15:45.743
- You have a ladies' room?
- Oh, yes. lt's lovely.

15:45.811 --> 15:47.472
We just put in a skylight.

15:48.914 --> 15:52.145
- Where is it?
- ln the ceiling.

15:53.185 --> 15:56.086
[Ned] No, no. lt's right through there.

15:58.090 --> 16:03.027
And we'd also like to thank
the folks at Saginaw Cheese

16:03.095 --> 16:07.998
for their mag wheels of cheddar.
[chuckles]

16:08.067 --> 16:12.197
Saginaw Cheese: cheese, it's good.

16:14.039 --> 16:16.200
<i>[phone rings]</i>

16:16.275 --> 16:20.177
- Hello?
- Hey, Al. Heidi went into labor.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.543
She joined a union?

16:24.249 --> 16:26.114
No. She's having her baby.

16:26.185 --> 16:29.712
We're at a gas station waiting for an
ambulance. We're not gonna make it.

16:29.788 --> 16:34.248
- That first takes forever to be born.
- [moans]

16:34.326 --> 16:37.386
Oh, my God! That's it.
This baby is coming.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.828
lt's coming?!

16:38.897 --> 16:41.127
The ambulance isn't here.
You're the mother.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.567
- Tell it to stop. Tell it to stop.
- [moaning]

16:44.636 --> 16:46.968
We have to get her up on this desk.
Clear it off.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.473
Give me those cushions.
Both. Put them under her.

16:49.541 --> 16:52.066
Do you need some help up, hon?

16:52.144 --> 16:56.103
l guess this would be a bad time
to ask you for my gas can.

16:56.215 --> 16:59.378
- You think?
- l'll get it.

16:59.451 --> 17:02.352
- Al, what is happening?
- The baby's coming.

17:02.421 --> 17:05.185
Don't worry, honey.
Everything is fine.

17:05.290 --> 17:09.659
- We have everything...
- [both] ...under control.

17:11.829 --> 17:16.858
- What do we do?
- You had three boys. You should know.

17:17.903 --> 17:22.067
Excuse me. lf you remember, l was
in a teensy bit of pain at the time.

17:22.174 --> 17:26.542
All l remember is a lot of screaming
and whatever sounds you were making.

17:29.114 --> 17:32.845
Wait a minute! Wilson can help!
Wilson's a trained midwife!

17:32.918 --> 17:35.045
Ah!

17:35.120 --> 17:36.348
[Heidi moans]

17:36.422 --> 17:38.788
<i>- Al, put Wilson on the phone.
- Just a second.</i>

17:38.891 --> 17:42.327
Yes. Jill, l hear there's
movement afoot in the birth canal.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.954
The contractions are coming fast.
What do we do?

17:45.030 --> 17:47.999
Now, just relax. You know Lamaze.
You can be Heidi's coach.

17:48.100 --> 17:51.592
- Let's have Tim be the receiver.
- Great idea!

17:52.905 --> 17:56.568
OK. OK. Deep cleansing breath in.
Chin down on the chest.

17:56.642 --> 17:59.304
[Tim moans]

18:00.379 --> 18:03.246
- Got it! Got it! Got it!
- Not you!

18:03.315 --> 18:05.408
l'm the coach.
You're the receiver.

18:05.484 --> 18:08.976
- Great! What am l receiving?
- [moans]

18:09.054 --> 18:11.079
Hello!

18:17.529 --> 18:19.827
- OK, Heidi?
- Yeah?

18:22.201 --> 18:24.692
Tim, get on the phone!
Do everything Wilson says.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.432
OK! Go ahead, Wilson! l'm here!

18:27.506 --> 18:29.667
l can't hear you! Come on!

18:31.376 --> 18:33.867
Now, Heidi, you're gonna push
on the contractions.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.675
- OK.
- Rest in between.

18:35.747 --> 18:37.476
Wilson, l don't think l can do this.

18:37.549 --> 18:41.918
l know you can, Tim. l'm reminded of the
English novelist George Eliot who says,

18:41.987 --> 18:44.012
''Necessity does the work of courage.''

18:44.089 --> 18:46.717
He's not looking
at a head coming out of a cervix!

18:46.792 --> 18:48.657
[moans]

18:48.727 --> 18:52.163
Oh, my God! The baby's coming!
Heidi, push!

18:52.231 --> 18:54.756
<i>- [moaning]
- Are you sure it's the head?</i>

18:54.833 --> 18:58.496
- l think so. lt's got a nose on it.
- [moaning]

18:58.570 --> 19:01.095
<i>[Wilson] Stroke down
the sides of the nose slowly.</i>

19:01.173 --> 19:03.733
<i>- This will help expel the fluid.
- OK.</i>

19:03.842 --> 19:06.777
He's got a real snoutfull on this!
l'll tell you that!

19:06.845 --> 19:09.405
Honey, you're doing great.

19:09.515 --> 19:12.973
All right now, Tim, hold the
baby's head gently in both hands.

19:13.051 --> 19:16.316
Press down slightly.
Tell Heidi to push.

19:16.388 --> 19:18.652
- Heidi, you gotta push.
- Heidi, push.

19:18.724 --> 19:21.557
- [groaning]
- Push! Push!

19:21.627 --> 19:24.460
- Push!
- [moaning]

19:24.530 --> 19:27.658
- l got a shoulder!
- They've got a shoulder.

19:27.733 --> 19:28.859
ls it a boy or a girl?

19:28.934 --> 19:32.563
Usually you can't tell by the shoulders.

19:32.638 --> 19:35.163
Now, Tim! Tim,
when the second shoulder is free,

19:35.240 --> 19:37.902
the rest of the baby
should slide out easily.

19:37.976 --> 19:41.104
OK! OK! l got the other shoulder!

19:41.180 --> 19:42.909
- Push. lt's coming!
- [screaming]

19:42.981 --> 19:45.142
Whoa! We got a baby!

19:45.250 --> 19:48.515
- We have a baby!
- [crying]

19:48.587 --> 19:50.851
Oh! What is it?

19:50.923 --> 19:53.221
Didn't you hear? lt's a baby!

19:55.661 --> 19:58.186
lt's a little girl.

19:58.263 --> 20:01.721
lt's a girl!
Looks just like Winston Churchill!

20:02.834 --> 20:06.964
- We have a girl!
- [cheering]

20:08.173 --> 20:10.437
Now, Tim, Tim,
this is very important.

20:10.509 --> 20:13.672
Find something soft and warm
and wrap the baby in it.

20:13.745 --> 20:16.111
- [crying]
- Gotta find something soft and warm.

20:16.181 --> 20:19.617
Soft and warm.
l gotta find something soft...

20:19.685 --> 20:22.119
Soft and warm!

20:22.721 --> 20:27.215
- Shh...
- Here, here. Put this around her. OK?

20:27.292 --> 20:30.455
OK. Congratulations, Heidi.

20:30.529 --> 20:35.296
[laughing] Oh, there she is.

20:36.602 --> 20:39.901
Tim, that's so sweet.
You gave my baby your jacket.

20:39.972 --> 20:43.066
''Lent'' your baby.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.572
- Look at her.
- Look at her!

20:48.914 --> 20:50.677
[sighs]

20:52.184 --> 20:53.947
[siren wailing]

20:56.355 --> 20:59.984
Ned, the girls are in the ambulance.
The baby's safe.

21:00.058 --> 21:03.084
- l think it's time to say goodbye.
- Not so fast.

21:03.161 --> 21:07.655
Under these circumstances,
you've got to have a cigar.

21:07.733 --> 21:11.191
Hey! Don't mind if l...

21:11.270 --> 21:13.135
Do l have to pay $1 50 deposit on this?

21:13.205 --> 21:17.699
No, no, no. lt's on me.
This is a time of celebration.

21:17.776 --> 21:21.303
You're right. A healthy baby
right here in the gas station.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.940
l'm sorry, sir. There's no smoking here.

21:27.386 --> 21:31.948
[Heidi laughing] Hi, sweetie.

21:32.057 --> 21:33.786
[Jill] She's so precious.

21:35.694 --> 21:37.855
[laughs] Look at her.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.491
[sighs]

21:40.565 --> 21:41.862
- [beeps]
- No, no, no.

21:41.933 --> 21:44.367
lt's on me.
This is a time of celebration.

21:44.436 --> 21:45.869
You bet it is, buddy.

21:45.937 --> 21:48.462
Uh, l'm sorry, sir.
There's no smoking here.

21:48.540 --> 21:51.270
We're sitting on thousands
of gallons of gasoline.

21:51.343 --> 21:55.302
- l'll smoke wherever l want to smoke.
- l'm warning you...

21:55.380 --> 21:58.110
...don't strike that match! Don't...

22:00.352 --> 22:02.650
[yelling]

22:06.224 --> 22:07.782
Whoo!
