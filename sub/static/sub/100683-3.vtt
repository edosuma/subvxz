WEBVTT

00:01.218 --> 00:02.698
I'm gonna miss you so much,

00:02.741 --> 00:04.830
but we can speak on the computerso you'll see my face.

00:04.874 --> 00:06.919
But we won't be able
to touch you.

00:06.963 --> 00:08.269
Hey, look.
You'll still have me.

00:08.312 --> 00:11.228
-Just you?-Yes. Just-- Your father. Hi.

00:25.329 --> 00:28.419
We have been invited
to a highly exclusive event.

00:28.463 --> 00:31.292
We will be spending
this Sunday evening

00:31.335 --> 00:35.905
at our neighbor Sean's
Superb Owl party.

00:35.948 --> 00:38.212
Vampires have huge respect
for owls.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.083
One: they're nocturnal,

00:40.127 --> 00:41.954
two: they're predators,
and three:

00:41.998 --> 00:45.523
they don't give a hoot
where they dump their scat.

00:45.567 --> 00:46.916
NADJA:
The party we're going to

00:46.959 --> 00:48.700
is celebrating the Superb Owl,

00:48.744 --> 00:50.746
who is the greatest owl
of all time.

00:50.789 --> 00:53.357
Do you think we're going to getto touch its little beak?

00:53.401 --> 00:55.229
Depends what mood he's in.

00:55.272 --> 00:59.146
Yeah, I know
it's a Super Bowl party, but

00:59.189 --> 01:01.496
I tried to correct them
and they wouldn't listen.

01:01.539 --> 01:04.194
That's the owl's egg.

01:04.238 --> 01:07.154
Also, I didn't try
all that hard.

01:09.417 --> 01:11.723
♪ Don't sing if you want
to live long♪

01:11.767 --> 01:14.378
♪ They have no use
for your song♪

01:14.422 --> 01:16.946
♪ You're dead, you're dead,
you're dead♪

01:16.989 --> 01:19.818
♪ You're dead
and out of this world♪

01:21.211 --> 01:24.301
♪ Now your hope and compassion
is gone♪

01:24.345 --> 01:27.348
♪ You sold out your dream
to the world♪

01:27.391 --> 01:29.393
♪ Stay dead, stay dead,
stay dead♪

01:29.437 --> 01:33.136
♪ You're dead
and out of this world.♪

01:41.623 --> 01:45.844
Remember, no killing
at this Superb Owl party...

01:45.888 --> 01:47.194
-Super Bowl.
-...out of respect

01:47.237 --> 01:49.979
for our good friend
and host, Sean.

01:50.022 --> 01:51.154
NANDOR:
Once this evening is over,

01:51.198 --> 01:52.547
Guillermo will have
a nice assortment

01:52.590 --> 01:54.331
-of virgins for us.

01:55.985 --> 01:57.726
Oh-- and behave.

01:57.769 --> 01:59.249
-Blend in.

01:59.293 --> 02:00.511
This is an all-human party.

02:00.555 --> 02:01.773
Hey!

02:01.817 --> 02:03.645
You guys made it! Nadja...

02:03.688 --> 02:06.952
Nandor... My man Laz...

02:06.996 --> 02:08.215
Dilbert-looking guy.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.304
So, what are you waiting for?

02:10.347 --> 02:13.089
Get your rears in gear
and get in here.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.264
-That counts.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.744
SEAN:
All right, come on!

02:15.787 --> 02:17.572
Yo, Charmaine!

02:17.615 --> 02:19.226
Look who it is.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.576
-Our European neighbors
from next door.
-Oh.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.404
Could you run to the ShopRite
and grab a few more bags

02:23.447 --> 02:25.188
of those Tostitos Hint of Limes

02:25.232 --> 02:26.407
before you start drinking?

02:26.450 --> 02:27.582
SEAN:
First off, I already started.

02:27.625 --> 02:28.844
-What?

02:28.887 --> 02:30.585
-What?
-Now you're catching
an attitude?

02:30.628 --> 02:32.587
-Right in front of our guests?
-: Well,
this is my house.

02:32.630 --> 02:34.241
I can catch whatever I want.

02:34.284 --> 02:35.459
Why don't you go catch it
somewhere else?

02:35.503 --> 02:37.331
Oh, shut up.

02:37.374 --> 02:38.549
SEAN:
It's always something
with this one.

02:38.593 --> 02:40.203
Anyway, come on in.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.771
Listen, we're sort of
a no-shoes household,

02:42.814 --> 02:45.208
-so, uh...
-I'm not taking my shoes off
for anyone.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.384
That's fine, Laz.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.430
GUILLERMO:
Virgins, virgins, virgins...

02:51.301 --> 02:53.347
Stupid. I don't know
why I always do that.

02:53.390 --> 02:56.132
You know, I've been thinking
about my lineage lately,

02:56.176 --> 02:58.047
and just because
I have Van Helsing blood in me

02:58.090 --> 03:01.224
doesn't mean that I'm destined
to be this vampire killer.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.010
Get back!

03:05.054 --> 03:06.621
I'm sure that
somewhere along the line

03:06.664 --> 03:08.144
there was an amazing baker

03:08.188 --> 03:09.624
in my family, right?

03:09.667 --> 03:10.929
But does that make me
an amazing baker?

03:10.973 --> 03:14.281
Actually, I am a really,
really good baker.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.067
Oh, no.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.460
COLIN:The thing with motion smoothing

03:19.503 --> 03:20.635
that you have to remember

03:20.678 --> 03:23.855
is, you want it on
for sporting events

03:23.899 --> 03:25.292
but off for TV and movies.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.816
Even take a football movie,

03:27.859 --> 03:30.949
like 1974's The Longest Yard,

03:30.993 --> 03:33.169
starring mustachioed actor
Burt Reynolds.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.518
Dude, you're--
you're blocking kickoff.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.390
Well, better to not watch
the game at all

03:36.433 --> 03:39.044
than to watch
in the wrong format, right?

03:39.088 --> 03:40.045
NADJA:
Colin, enough!

03:40.089 --> 03:41.438
They want the owl.

03:41.482 --> 03:43.310
So, do you have any knowledge

03:43.353 --> 03:44.746
of the owl's temperament
tonight?

03:44.789 --> 03:46.835
Uh, I hope it's not too fussy.

03:46.878 --> 03:49.490
Who, Charmaine?
No, she's always like that.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.318
-CHARMAINE: What'd you say,
Frankie?

03:51.361 --> 03:53.102
-FRANK: Oh, nothing.

03:53.145 --> 03:54.538
You still owe me $100
for that pizza night.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.540
-Oh, get out of here!
-No, you don't get to talk

03:56.584 --> 03:58.499
-until you give me that pizza...-I paid you back two weeks ago.

03:58.542 --> 03:59.717
-SEAN: Get off it, Charmaine!
-He never paid me back.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.197
-Get off it!
-100 bucks for pizza?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.330
Ugh, Nadia, you must be
miserable in here.

04:03.373 --> 04:04.505
All this testosterone. Come on.

04:04.548 --> 04:05.506
The other wives are having

04:05.549 --> 04:06.289
a little powwow in the kitchen.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.291
-Sean has more wives?
-SEAN: I wish.

04:08.335 --> 04:09.553
Excuse me?

04:09.597 --> 04:10.946
-Nothing, nothing.
-Yeah, that's what I thought.

04:10.989 --> 04:12.339
MIKEY :
Busted.

04:12.382 --> 04:14.341
So, how come we never see
you guys around here

04:14.384 --> 04:16.517
-during the regular season?
-SEAN: Believe me, I tried

04:16.560 --> 04:17.561
to get 'em to hang,

04:17.605 --> 04:19.433
but they never seem to be aroundduring the day.

04:19.476 --> 04:20.521
You know, come to think of it,

04:20.564 --> 04:22.523
I really only see them at night.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.438
It's like they're, uh, vampiresor something.

04:34.012 --> 04:36.014
-Get in.

04:36.058 --> 04:37.364
Fuck.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.017
You heard what he said.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.367
He knows we're vampires.

04:44.371 --> 04:47.374
Um, ocupado.

04:47.417 --> 04:50.246
Yes. Uh, we are just taking
a nice shit together.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.813
WOMAN:
I-I'll come back.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.729
I think we need to...

04:54.772 --> 04:56.818
-What, "whack" him?
-Yes.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.472
No, if we "whack" him,

04:58.515 --> 05:00.387
we'll have to "whack" everybody.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.432
The place will be
a fucking bloodbath.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.478
But he knows our dark secret.

05:04.521 --> 05:05.914
All right.

05:05.957 --> 05:09.483
Let's get him to a private placewhere we'll both hypnotize him.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.398
He'll forget everything.

05:11.441 --> 05:15.227
-Good old double hypnosis.
-Yes.

05:15.271 --> 05:18.013
GUILLERMO:
It's tough finding new groups
of virgins.

05:18.056 --> 05:21.756
Tried joggers. Hard to catch
and very sweaty and slippery.

05:21.799 --> 05:23.235
Tried incels.
Definitely virgins.

05:23.279 --> 05:25.150
But very bitter, apparently.

05:25.194 --> 05:28.371
"Mosquito Collectors
of the Tristate Area."

05:28.415 --> 05:31.287
Beep, beep, beep. Nerd alert.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.245
I'm kidding.

05:33.289 --> 05:35.552
They are nerds, though.
They're probably virgins.

05:35.596 --> 05:39.861
Sourcing food for my master
does have its benefits.

05:39.904 --> 05:42.298
It gives me a chance to search for my own food.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.865
And save some for later.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.389
So, um,

05:46.433 --> 05:49.566
how long have you guys been, uh,collecting mosquitoes for?

05:49.610 --> 05:51.438
Seems like it would take up
a lot of your time

05:51.481 --> 05:52.961
and it wouldn't leave much timefor anything else.

05:53.004 --> 05:55.093
Dating.

05:55.137 --> 05:58.532
What makes you so interested
in mosquito collecting, son?

05:59.663 --> 06:01.622
-Well?
-Uh, I love insects.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.973
Mosquitoes

06:05.016 --> 06:07.628
are an evil, deadly species.

06:07.671 --> 06:10.848
Doesn't the fact that they drinkhuman blood sicken you?

06:10.892 --> 06:13.329
-Yeah.-CLAUDE: Yeah? Sure about that?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.200
You guys are the ones
with the mosquito club.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.506
- Just...
-What about

06:16.550 --> 06:18.465
other creatures
that drink human blood?

06:18.508 --> 06:21.729
Creatures with sharp teeth
and stupid accents?

06:24.819 --> 06:26.255
You...

06:26.298 --> 06:29.432
Y-You mean, um, vampires?

06:29.476 --> 06:31.434
You said that, not me.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.436
You did.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.569
But yeah.

06:35.612 --> 06:38.615
Do evil, bloodsucking vampires
sicken you?

06:40.704 --> 06:43.098
Yeah. Yeah.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.274
-They make me sick.
-You sure about that?

06:45.317 --> 06:47.668
Yeah, I want to throw up
right now.

06:47.711 --> 06:50.627
Well, brother,you've come to the right place.

06:50.671 --> 06:51.672
He's worthy.

06:51.715 --> 06:53.500
-Yes.
-Yes.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.502
-Come on, guys. He's worthy.
-TONYA: Oh.

06:55.545 --> 06:56.807
Like we practiced.

06:58.330 --> 06:59.419
-Activate.
-Yes!

07:03.161 --> 07:05.120
CLAUDE:
Huh?

07:05.163 --> 07:07.122
Holy...

07:14.172 --> 07:16.740
-You guys are vampire hunters.

07:16.784 --> 07:17.959
Hell, yeah, we are.

07:18.002 --> 07:19.613
Yeah, that mosquito thing?
It's all a cover.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.136
Actually,
you're the first person

07:21.179 --> 07:22.659
we've gotten to do
that cool reveal for.

07:22.703 --> 07:23.747
Wow.

07:29.623 --> 07:30.754
Moving around like a l-lunatic.Put a collar

07:30.798 --> 07:31.755
on the guy, you know?

07:32.887 --> 07:35.716
Great joke, assholes.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.587
-We were just saying
what a beautiful house

07:37.631 --> 07:39.371
-you have.
-Oh, thanks.

07:39.415 --> 07:41.548
Yes. Uh, we were also wondering

07:41.591 --> 07:44.725
if it has an attic
or basement or...

07:44.768 --> 07:46.770
-Yeah.
-...dark, soundproof room

07:46.814 --> 07:48.424
you could show us?

07:48.468 --> 07:49.947
Oh, you guys want a tour.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.993
Yeah, sure. So, these steps

07:52.036 --> 07:54.561
were built by my Uncle Fulvio
in 2011.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.563
-And then Sean says to me,

07:56.606 --> 07:58.521
"Why don't we wait to celebrateour anniversary until after

07:58.565 --> 08:00.305
"I get back
from the Islanders game?

08:00.349 --> 08:01.568
-If they win."
-What?

08:01.611 --> 08:03.787
-LIZA: My Ronnie did

08:03.831 --> 08:05.659
the exact same thing to me,
only he did it

08:05.702 --> 08:07.617
on the same day
as my sister's funeral.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.140
-CHARMAINE: No.
-Are you kidding?
-Yeah. He said that...

08:09.184 --> 08:11.099
NADJA:
I had completely forgotten
that when a human

08:11.142 --> 08:15.233
takes a mate, the mate keepsgrowing and changing and aging.

08:15.277 --> 08:16.321
-LIZA: He said that.
-Wow.

08:16.365 --> 08:18.541
Can I ask you all, m-my ladies,

08:18.585 --> 08:20.761
you are all
such strong, beautiful,

08:20.804 --> 08:23.677
-vicious, vibrant women.
-Yes.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.941
How did you all end up married
to such boiled potatoes?

08:28.377 --> 08:30.553
You know what, though?Seanie used to be so thoughtful.

08:30.597 --> 08:31.902
He was so sweet.

08:31.946 --> 08:33.425
When my dog had to get put down,

08:33.469 --> 08:34.775
he brought me flowers
for a month straight.

08:34.818 --> 08:35.819
WENDY:
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

08:35.863 --> 08:36.820
CHARMAINE:
Yeah, what happened to us?

08:36.864 --> 08:38.430
NADJA:
These poor women.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.215
They take a lovely,
handsome chap

08:40.258 --> 08:42.826
from the street,
make him their husband,

08:42.870 --> 08:45.263
and then,
in the blinks of an eye,

08:45.307 --> 08:48.179
he becomes
a big, lazy sack of shit.

08:48.223 --> 08:49.485
So sad.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.791
All right.
Who needs some more wine?

08:50.834 --> 08:52.270
I think
that this bottle's turned,

08:52.314 --> 08:53.750
-but it'll still
get the job done.
-Yes, please.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.143
-You love wine.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.797
-WENDY: Oh, yeah.
-CHARMAINE: Hey, Joanie.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.234
What, are you lost? Do you wantto go back up to bed?

08:59.277 --> 09:01.018
Oh, what kind of movie
are you making?

09:01.062 --> 09:02.063
-There's a camera.
-CHARMAINE: Oh.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.151
You should get back up to bed.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.718
-Oh, we love wine.

09:04.761 --> 09:05.849
WENDY:
Holy shit.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.851
-What?
-JOAN: It's you.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.505
I-It's you. I-I used

09:09.549 --> 09:10.941
to see you sitting
up in the tree.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.770
No, Ma, this is
our next-door neighbor.

09:13.814 --> 09:16.207
I'm sorry about her.
This is Sean's mom.

09:16.251 --> 09:18.819
The neurologist
has her on Aricept now,

09:18.862 --> 09:20.734
but when the sun goes down,
she gets a little mixed up.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.649
You transformed yourself
into a cat.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.825
-You taught me the dance

09:24.868 --> 09:26.957
-of the ancient soothsayer.
-NADJA: Ooh!

09:27.001 --> 09:28.393
Calm yourself, dear.

09:28.437 --> 09:29.612
You're just feeling
a little bit demented,

09:29.656 --> 09:30.787
that's all.

09:30.831 --> 09:32.746
I'm so sorry about your brain.

09:32.789 --> 09:35.009
Oh, yeah, everythingshe's saying is completely true.

09:35.052 --> 09:36.837
I am Nadja.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.056
Sean's mother Joanie grew up
right here in this house.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.667
We used to have
so much fun together.

09:40.710 --> 09:44.322
I used to pin her
to the ceiling for hours.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.324
She cried and cried.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.109
-I know you.
-Guys, uh, can you help
get Ma back up to bed?

09:48.152 --> 09:49.719
I know her. I know who she is.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.852
NADJA: She used to be
such a cute, little

09:51.895 --> 09:52.766
fresh-faced girl.

09:52.809 --> 09:55.551
But now she just looks
like an elephant's knee.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.292
-Okay, don't make me
pick you up, Joan.
-NADJA: Sorry

09:57.335 --> 09:58.859
-about how demented you are. Oh.-

09:58.902 --> 10:01.644
SEAN:
And here it is.
The crown jewel of the home.

10:01.688 --> 10:04.081
The world's largest collection

10:04.125 --> 10:06.083
of Ocean's Twelvememorabilia.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.520
Brad Pitt's tinted sunglasses
from when

10:08.564 --> 10:10.566
he first meets Baron Toulour.
Ooh!

10:10.610 --> 10:13.656
Scott Caan bobblehead,
mint condish. Yeah, it's like,

10:13.700 --> 10:15.876
they did some decent
world-building in Eleven,

10:15.919 --> 10:17.660
but it all pays off
in Ocean's Twelve.

10:17.704 --> 10:20.097
You need to fucking stop talkingabout the sea.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.317
-What?
-We know that you know
our secret.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.492
What secret?

10:23.535 --> 10:25.015
That we are vampires.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.887
You said it downstairs in front

10:26.930 --> 10:29.541
-of all of your round friends.
-I was just joking.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.805
You're not vampires.
Get the fuck out of here.

10:31.848 --> 10:34.111
Yes, we are.

10:34.155 --> 10:36.897
Whoa! How are you doing this?

10:36.940 --> 10:39.160
Where are the wires?
How are you doing that?!

10:39.203 --> 10:41.815
I'm thinking
maybe he didn't know.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.338
-So, we shouldn't hypnotize him?-

10:43.381 --> 10:45.775
-No, now we definitely should.
-Oh, fuck.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.559
Vampires are real.

10:47.603 --> 10:50.301
-Vampires are real!
-Let the double hypnosis

10:50.345 --> 10:51.912
-commence.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.174
We command

10:53.217 --> 10:55.132
-that you forget...
-You forget

10:55.176 --> 10:59.920
-everything.
-...that we are vampires,
please.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.967
I think it's worked.

11:04.011 --> 11:05.839
What happened?

11:05.882 --> 11:07.710
Quite all right, Sean?

11:07.754 --> 11:08.711
Uh, yeah, totally.

11:08.755 --> 11:11.061
But wh-who's Sean?

11:11.105 --> 11:14.282
Shit. He's forgotten everything.

11:14.325 --> 11:17.154
CLAUDE:
So, what are some of the terms
we use for vampires?

11:17.198 --> 11:18.721
Mosquitoes.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.942
Suckers. Biters.

11:21.985 --> 11:22.986
GUILLERMO :
I know that it seems like

11:23.030 --> 11:25.075
a big coincidence that I go outlooking for virgins

11:25.119 --> 11:27.948
and find a secret den
of vampire hunters,

11:27.991 --> 11:29.645
but this is no coincidence.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.125
Okay? It's like
the universe has been trying

11:31.168 --> 11:32.996
to tell me for a long time,
"Hey, Guillermo."

11:33.040 --> 11:34.868
And I've been like, "I don't
know, I don't think so."

11:34.911 --> 11:36.130
But now like, "Hey, Guillermo.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.785
Yeah, dude. Yeah."

11:38.828 --> 11:39.916
CLAUDE:
Familiars

11:39.960 --> 11:42.571
are pathetic,

11:42.614 --> 11:46.314
lonely, desperate, low-IQ,

11:46.357 --> 11:49.143
sad losers.

11:49.186 --> 11:51.798
They live to do the bidding
of their cruel,

11:51.841 --> 11:53.974
uncaring masters.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.584
Okay, gonna open up the floor to

11:55.627 --> 11:58.195
any thoughts and/or suggestions.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.806
Oh, um, Claude, okay.

11:59.849 --> 12:02.678
One idea that I had is, uh,

12:02.722 --> 12:04.985
that I think that we should
all have sex with each other.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.988
'Cause that way if any of us
is a virgin, then, you know,

12:08.031 --> 12:09.685
we wouldn't be any longer.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.600
And then it would prevent us
from being targeted

12:11.643 --> 12:13.254
-by vampires.
-Derek...

12:13.297 --> 12:15.386
you need to stop
suggesting that.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.867
Okay, yeah, yeah,
to-totally, yeah.

12:19.695 --> 12:22.916
Knock, knock, Joanie.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.048
Miss Nadja, is it really you?

12:25.092 --> 12:26.963
Yes, of course it is me.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.009
I was lying down there.

12:29.052 --> 12:32.360
Oh, I've missed you so much,
my little Joanie!

12:32.403 --> 12:35.406
So, did you have a good life?

12:35.450 --> 12:37.147
Uh, yes.

12:37.191 --> 12:39.497
I-I think so. Oh!

12:39.541 --> 12:41.935
I took a trip to Nova Scotia
at one point.

12:44.502 --> 12:47.462
And did you marry
that boy you liked?

12:47.505 --> 12:48.985
-Franklin?
-Yeah.

12:49.029 --> 12:51.031
Oh, yes, I...

12:51.074 --> 12:52.728
Oh, wow, look.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.949
You were very beautiful
for a very brief moment.

12:55.992 --> 12:56.950
Wait.

12:56.993 --> 12:59.256
Where did you get this necklace?

12:59.300 --> 13:01.041
This is my necklace.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.739
-Pardon?
-The jade one in this photo.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.395
You motherfucker!

13:07.438 --> 13:09.223
It was my prized jade necklace.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.225
It was given to me  by my mother when I was young,

13:11.268 --> 13:14.010
just before she was
eaten by a bear.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.664
I should have known
you would have stolen it!

13:15.707 --> 13:17.971
You were always
a sneaky little human shit!

13:18.014 --> 13:21.322
You know, if you listen to it,you can still hear her screams.

13:21.365 --> 13:23.280
-It was the type of jade

13:23.324 --> 13:24.891
that absorbs human screams.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.893
And she was really screaming.

13:26.936 --> 13:29.896
So it took it very strongly.
Thieving bitch!

13:29.939 --> 13:31.636
Give it back to me!

13:31.680 --> 13:33.203
You little brat, where is it?!

13:33.247 --> 13:34.639
I don't know what you're
talking about!

13:34.683 --> 13:35.989
You are a lying piece
of old cabbage!

13:36.032 --> 13:39.079
But I don't know what
you're talking-- help!

13:39.122 --> 13:41.908
Help! I'm having
an episode! Help!

13:41.951 --> 13:43.910
-She attacked me!
-Oh, no, she didn't.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.912
-Oh, she-she did.
-Nadia, go.

13:45.955 --> 13:47.739
Go enjoy yourself,
we'll take care of her.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.480
-Ma, she didn't attack you.
-She-she did.

13:49.524 --> 13:51.918
Mama? Mama?

13:51.961 --> 13:53.528
Scream for me.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.011
My mother gave it to me.

13:58.054 --> 14:00.927
She said, um, "I can't
wait to see you wear this

14:00.970 --> 14:04.104
for the rest of your life
every minute of every day."

14:04.147 --> 14:05.975
And then, honestly,
the next day,

14:06.019 --> 14:07.672
walked out the house
and bam-- bear.

14:07.716 --> 14:10.371
Mama, scream for me
if you're here.

14:10.414 --> 14:13.113
That is worse than a bible--
that burns my eyes.

14:15.158 --> 14:17.378
Mama?

14:19.423 --> 14:20.947
Mama!

14:23.645 --> 14:27.301
COLIN:
Sure, the guys on the field
are having a good time today,

14:27.344 --> 14:30.086
but they're not gonna be havingsuch a good time in 20 years.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.914
That's when they'll have

14:31.958 --> 14:34.525
applesauce sloshing
around in their skulls.

14:34.569 --> 14:37.833
Has anyone heard the ancient
screams of a very large woman?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.139
ANNOUNCER:
What a throw by...

14:39.182 --> 14:41.837
-The halftime show--

14:41.881 --> 14:43.795
a lot of people consider that
to be the highlight.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.493
I like the commercials.

14:45.536 --> 14:48.148
I like to see what they come
up with for the Clydesdales

14:48.191 --> 14:50.933
-each year.
-All right, bros, who's ready

14:50.977 --> 14:54.632
for piping-hot nachos
fresh from the microwave?

14:54.676 --> 14:57.505
FRANK:
Uh, Sean, those are batteries.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.986
LASZLO:
It is possible
to over-hypnotize,

15:00.029 --> 15:02.162
and I fear

15:02.205 --> 15:03.946
that's what we've done
with Sean.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.340
You see, there's various
levels of over-hypnosis.

15:06.383 --> 15:08.995
If it's not too serious, it's
what's called "Weak Brain."

15:09.038 --> 15:12.389
If it's slightly worrying, it's  called "Thoughtless Sallies."

15:12.433 --> 15:15.088
And if it's a fucking nightmare  and you can forget about him,

15:15.131 --> 15:16.393
it's "Brain Scramblies."

15:16.437 --> 15:17.742
Yes! Yes!

15:21.050 --> 15:23.357
Go, go, yeah,
no, oh, come on!

15:23.400 --> 15:26.012
How is that a yellow card?!
Are you kidding me?!

15:31.495 --> 15:34.542
Typically, when a vampire turnsa human's brain into pudding

15:34.585 --> 15:36.109
from over-hypnosis,

15:36.152 --> 15:38.241
the proper etiquette is

15:38.285 --> 15:40.200
to put them
out of their misery...

15:40.243 --> 15:42.071
by murdering them.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.552
We're not gonna kill him.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.989
It goes against
our non-killing agreement.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.252
Yes, but it is now
necessary to do

15:49.296 --> 15:51.254
the humane thing
and rip Sean's head off.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.691
-Uh, not now.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.171
We are taking
a human shit together.

15:55.215 --> 15:58.044
-Uh...
-Have either of you two seen

15:58.087 --> 16:00.046
a jade necklace containing
the bloodcurdling screams

16:00.089 --> 16:01.830
of my dead mother in here?

16:01.873 --> 16:03.614
Eh... oh, maybe check behind

16:03.658 --> 16:06.226
the Andy Garcia cross-stitch.

16:06.269 --> 16:08.271
SEAN:
No soap? Radio?

16:08.315 --> 16:10.491
Ha, bowling ball.

16:10.534 --> 16:13.276
Nandor wants to kill Sean 'causehe's got the Brain Scramblies.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.843
Well, then Nandor is correct.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.063
Have you gone soft,
my sweet syrup pie?

16:17.106 --> 16:18.716
No, my sweet syrup pie,
I've gone hard.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.718
-'Cause he's my best friend,
he's my pal.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.025
He's my homeboy,
my rotten soldier.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.375
He's my sweet cheese,
my good-time boy.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.638
Laszlo, this is clearly
what must be done.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.729
Oh, Yahtzee!

16:31.773 --> 16:33.427
For Sean's own sake.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.081
I'll go get
my head-ripping gloves.

16:35.124 --> 16:37.039
No, no, no, hang on, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.432
We're not animals.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.738
Let's give him one
last night to remember.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.914
One magical night
on Earth before we...

16:42.958 --> 16:44.264
"whack" him.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.918
Well, okay, yes, that is fair.

16:48.311 --> 16:49.486
I can feel it, guys.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.706
I mean, I really think
we are, like,

16:51.749 --> 16:53.621
this close to finding
our first vampire.

16:53.664 --> 16:56.276
-Yes.
-Wait, so you guys

16:56.319 --> 16:58.278
have never actually...

16:58.321 --> 17:00.236
met or seen a real vampire.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.282
Well, come on,
it's not like they're just

17:02.325 --> 17:03.979
walking around
in broad daylight, you know?

17:04.023 --> 17:05.067
-Yeah.
-Throwing a football
in the park.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.634
-Seriously.
-Running errands.

17:06.677 --> 17:08.288
-Yeah.
-Going to the bank.

17:08.331 --> 17:10.116
-Eating a pretzel.
-Yeah.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.900
-Walking a dog...
-SHANICE: I have.

17:11.943 --> 17:14.859
My roommate

17:14.903 --> 17:16.339
was turned

17:16.383 --> 17:17.688
by a vampire.

17:17.732 --> 17:19.647
And became a vampire.

17:19.690 --> 17:22.084
She died right
in front of my eyes.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.086
But then she came back to life.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.305
What the fuck?!

17:25.348 --> 17:28.308
But she was different, sick...

17:28.351 --> 17:30.701
unnatural.

17:30.745 --> 17:31.963
And eventually she just...

17:32.007 --> 17:33.661
vanished.

17:33.704 --> 17:36.446
Her future was so bright.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.796
She was such a brilliant LARPer.

17:38.840 --> 17:39.928
GUILLERMO:
I think Shanice and I

17:39.971 --> 17:42.061
might have a mutual friend.

17:45.194 --> 17:47.240
Small world.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.764
This is the life.

17:49.807 --> 17:52.593
Hanging out with
my three favorite gerbils.

17:52.636 --> 17:55.291
I only have one question--
are we inside or outside?

17:55.335 --> 17:57.163
-You need to focus, Sean.
-Huh?

17:57.206 --> 17:59.687
And enjoy the most magical
night of your life.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.036
Hold tight.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.256
What? Whoa...
How are you doing this?!

18:03.299 --> 18:04.822
How are you doing this?!

18:04.866 --> 18:06.259
What's going on now?!

18:06.302 --> 18:07.521
Oh, God, no! Mother Mary!

18:07.564 --> 18:09.262
-Wait for us.
-Here we come.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.307
Hey!

18:13.570 --> 18:16.182
Oh, no, no! Fuck me!

18:16.225 --> 18:18.184
LASZLO:
Now that you've experienced

18:18.227 --> 18:19.924
the pleasure of flying,

18:19.968 --> 18:23.363
enjoy the marvel
of transfiguration.

18:23.406 --> 18:24.146
What?

18:24.190 --> 18:25.843
Bat!

18:25.887 --> 18:27.802
Whoa! Where'd that asshole go?!

18:27.845 --> 18:29.412
Oh, God! Get off!

18:29.456 --> 18:32.067
Look at that,
he's having a lovely time.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.505
-He loves this.
-No, get out of my hair!

18:35.549 --> 18:36.941
Get out of my hair! Get...!

18:36.985 --> 18:38.726
-Sean, look at me.
-No!

18:38.769 --> 18:40.380
Stop that! What are you doing?

18:40.423 --> 18:41.642
It ain't natural!

18:41.685 --> 18:43.557
Are you enjoying
watching me, Sean?

18:43.600 --> 18:45.298
No! Stop it! Get down here!

18:47.474 --> 18:49.215
Ooh, get a good look at this!
Wow!

18:49.258 --> 18:51.652
-Holy shit!
-Sorry, Laszlo.

18:51.695 --> 18:53.219
But, you know,
it's his last night.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.307
LASZLO:
I don't care.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.657
And now for the grand finale.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.399
NANDOR:
We vampires have
dominion of animals.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.792
So we decided
to throw you a little

19:01.836 --> 19:03.054
puppy party.

19:05.274 --> 19:06.623
What have you done?!

19:06.667 --> 19:08.190
-Oh, God!

19:13.456 --> 19:15.415
-Sean.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.896
We did something
really good tonight.

19:18.940 --> 19:21.334
I'm proud of us.

19:21.377 --> 19:22.335
-Yes.
-My boys.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.474
I haven't really had
many real friends.

19:31.518 --> 19:35.348
So, when I met Jenna,
my whole life changed, really.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.480
But she was taken from me.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.482
GUILLERMO:
I guess I never really
think about

19:39.526 --> 19:42.485
the victims or their families.

19:42.529 --> 19:45.488
Uh, I guess I switched
that part of my brain off

19:45.532 --> 19:48.491
with, um, feelings and emotions.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.580
Killing vampires,
killing humans,

19:50.624 --> 19:54.105
collecting victims--
it's all so nasty and ugly.

19:54.149 --> 19:56.412
And, you know, I devoted
my life to it, so...

19:59.154 --> 20:00.851
SHANICE:
So that's why I'm here!

20:00.895 --> 20:04.594
Because vampires cause
nothing but pain!

20:04.638 --> 20:06.466
-Hear, hear.
-Hear, hear.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.032
Come on, say "aye"
if you're with me.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.426
-Aye!
-I have to go.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.298
I'm so sorry.

20:12.341 --> 20:14.822
-I think I left
my toilet running.
-You sure?

20:14.865 --> 20:17.172
-Yeah.
-We're just about to start
crossbow practice.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.393
-What's that?
-Derek got us some mannequins
to use as targets.

20:20.436 --> 20:21.742
Yeah.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.744
-Get a load of this, huh?
-That's a weapon.

20:23.787 --> 20:26.486
-Yeah.
-And those are vampires?

20:26.529 --> 20:28.183
Yeah, I got the costumes
at a Halloween store.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.577
Okay, I don't think
I'd be really...

20:35.364 --> 20:36.626
Damn, pimp!

20:36.670 --> 20:37.932
-I have to go.
-Whoa!

20:37.975 --> 20:39.499
I'm sorry, is-is it just me,

20:39.542 --> 20:40.543
or is this guy an epic pimp?

20:40.587 --> 20:41.631
We'll see you
on Wednesday, right?

20:41.675 --> 20:42.893
No, yeah, a-and if you don't,

20:42.937 --> 20:44.547
it was really nice meeting you.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.897
And, Shanice, I'm very
sorry about your friend.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.986
And you guys should be
really careful

20:49.030 --> 20:50.988
when dealing with vampires--
they're no joke.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.513
CLAUDE:
Hey, hope to see you
again soon, son.

20:53.556 --> 20:55.166
And not just 'cause you,

20:55.210 --> 20:56.646
you have wicked skills
with the C-bow.

20:56.690 --> 20:59.170
You're a mighty cool dude,
Guillermo.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.565
Thank you.

21:05.176 --> 21:06.482
CLAUDE:
Just slide it.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.484
-Yeah, push it to the left...
-Yeah, you got

21:08.528 --> 21:10.573
-to throw your weight into it.
-There you go, you got it.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.358
All right, we'll close it--
don't worry about it.

21:12.401 --> 21:13.881
GUILLERMO:
All right.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.883
Well, that was a lot of fun,
old chap.

21:15.926 --> 21:18.712
I bet you could die a happy man.

21:20.583 --> 21:21.671
He's worse than before.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.412
We've ruined him again.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.022
All the more reason to put him
out of his misery.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.110
Go ahead, Nandor.

21:26.154 --> 21:27.111
Yes.

21:27.155 --> 21:29.288
Here I go.

21:30.201 --> 21:32.552
Head rub time.

21:32.595 --> 21:33.901
LASZLO:
Forgive us, old chap.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.729
Oh, my God.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.426
Who is that piece of ass?

21:37.470 --> 21:39.602
Mamaloosha!

21:39.646 --> 21:40.734
That is Charmaine.

21:40.777 --> 21:42.126
You know her?

21:42.170 --> 21:43.345
She's your wife.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.129
Yeah.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.784
-I wish.
-Seanie!

21:47.828 --> 21:49.569
I've been calling for you
for, like, 20 minutes.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.353
The garbage disposal's
all messed up again.

21:51.397 --> 21:54.400
You are the most
beautiful creature

21:54.443 --> 21:56.227
I have ever seen.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.403
CHARMAINE:
Stop messing around.

21:57.446 --> 21:58.447
SEAN:
I want to spend the rest

21:58.491 --> 22:00.188
of my life making you happy.

22:00.231 --> 22:01.189
This is for you.

22:01.232 --> 22:04.061
It's a token of my undying love.

22:04.105 --> 22:05.846
You emptied out a junk drawer?

22:05.889 --> 22:07.848
-What the hell is
wrong with you?

22:07.891 --> 22:10.633
Wha... what is this?

22:10.677 --> 22:12.026
-What?
-This is beautiful.

22:12.069 --> 22:13.854
Seanie, did you get this for me?

22:13.897 --> 22:15.943
-That is my necklace.
-Oh, my God, Seanie.

22:15.986 --> 22:18.249
-This is a bloody...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:18.293 --> 22:19.773
Leave them to it, my darling.

22:21.992 --> 22:24.647
I suppose it is quite sweet.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.388
I'll just get it when they die.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.478
NANDOR:
So, we didn't need

22:29.522 --> 22:31.654
to kill Sean after all.

22:31.698 --> 22:35.223
Yes, his mind has been wiped
to a blank slate and now

22:35.266 --> 22:37.965
he can start a new one just
focused on the amazingness

22:38.008 --> 22:39.880
of his wife
and his marriage, and

22:39.923 --> 22:42.448
he doesn't remember
we're vampires at all.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.624
Come on, Colin Robinson.

22:44.667 --> 22:45.973
-We're off.
-Hold on a minute.

22:46.016 --> 22:47.757
I-I may have overdone it.

22:47.801 --> 22:50.499
This one just pissed himself.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.414
Who cares? Come on, let's go.

22:52.458 --> 22:53.807
NANDOR:
So, all in all, I would say

22:53.850 --> 22:55.591
our first Superb Owl celebration

22:55.635 --> 22:58.507
was a marked success.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.857

didn't show up.

after all these years?

23:14.567 --> 23:18.440
I have the gift of eternal life.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.529
Oh, wow.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.488
-Yeah, well.
-Oh, can you

23:22.531 --> 23:24.098
share this gift with me?

23:24.141 --> 23:25.708
I would love to be young again.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.884
Yeah, that's not really
how it works.

23:27.928 --> 23:30.887
If I turned you,
you would stay forever...

23:30.931 --> 23:33.063

-VOCALIST: Hey!

24:30.686 --> 24:31.470
Another.

24:33.602 --> 24:35.474
-Ooh, ooh, ooh.

24:37.345 --> 24:38.738
-Text me.
-Nope.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.225
-Mom.
-Yes?

24:48.269 --> 24:50.793
-Okay. I want
a big party this year.
-Serious?

24:50.837 --> 24:52.795
-I want a quinceañera.
-Quinceañera?

24:52.839 --> 24:56.277
We can't do that.
We're too white for that.
We're not allowed.

25:05.852 --> 25:08.811
Do me a favor?Never look me in the eye again.

25:08.855 --> 25:11.814
Okay? 'Cause your stare
is way too intense.

25:11.858 --> 25:13.599
It's starting to make
my hair fall out.

25:19.082 --> 25:20.997
Our women do not
consider themselves

25:21.041 --> 25:22.608
enslaved by marriage.

25:25.393 --> 25:30.703
And they certainly
do not want to sacrifice
their present privileges

25:30.746 --> 25:33.488
for some phony equality
with men.
