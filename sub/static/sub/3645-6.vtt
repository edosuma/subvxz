KRISTIN: I love you, Bri.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.577
-You're warm.
-I think I have a fever.

00:11.579 --> 00:12.277
Everybody's doing the funny.

00:12.279 --> 00:15.147
MEG: Tina Greenwood,
reported missing
right after Thanksgiving.

00:15.149 --> 00:15.714
SAM: It's the same girl.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.183
-You went to high school
with her.
-Vineland High is a big place.

00:18.185 --> 00:21.086
He doesn't remember
the first missing girl
from high school.

00:21.088 --> 00:23.088
And I can't shoot
my wad on a hunch.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.724
You will help Dick Nixon
take the White House.

00:25.726 --> 00:29.728
Your lives are going
to be lived completely
in the public eye.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.898
You do not live apart.
You do not get divorced.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.033
We sold the house.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.035
Here's the new address.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.036
Where have you
been hiding that voice?

00:37.038 --> 00:40.572
Charlie, I thought
you were the only one
in the family that could sing.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.241
-Terry?
-Good to see you, man.

00:42.243 --> 00:46.045
-Hi, I'm Terry.
-I know who you are.

Oh. Sorry, sir.

01:57.985 --> 01:58.851
(CHUCKLES)

01:58.853 --> 02:04.456
Well, I don't want it now.
You touched it
with your black paw.

02:13.601 --> 02:17.269
Hey. Who's the new Mr. Groovy?

02:17.271 --> 02:18.971
It's Gregg something.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.206
Music producer.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.641
He's tight with Terry.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.810
Well, if he's tight with Terry

02:25.179 --> 02:26.745
why ain't you
making him happy?

02:26.747 --> 02:29.982
-He wants Boots.
-Dennis wants Boots, too.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.550
Dennis wants everybody.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.754
SADIE: Melcher's girl
in the million dollar boots.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.656
Melcher, Dennis, Greg.
They all want her.

02:37.658 --> 02:41.426
Men think they want
fancy puss, but they don't.

02:41.428 --> 02:44.530
They want you, my alley cats,

02:44.532 --> 02:46.431
barefoot and free.

02:46.433 --> 02:49.668
Go give Terry what
he don't know he wants.

Bring the ball back.
Get over here. Hurry up.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.312
Come on. Let's go!

03:00.681 --> 03:03.949
Well, she's the right
age and height
to be Tina Greenwood,

03:03.951 --> 03:07.286
but the body's
too decomposed to identify.

03:07.288 --> 03:07.586
(GRUNTS)

03:07.588 --> 03:12.224
Lucky it was pouring rain,
or the kid never would've
found the corpse.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.693
There's skin
tissue left on the ribs.

03:14.695 --> 03:19.798
Maybe I can
extract imbedded fabric,
ID, blouse, panties.

03:21.502 --> 03:24.937
Show some respect, huh?
We treated
the Viet Cong better.

03:24.939 --> 03:27.673
Trying to gross him out?
What do you really got?

03:27.675 --> 03:32.911
These look like what
the mother described
in the missing persons report.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.647
I'll show them to her.

That Bobby's a thug.

Yeah.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.099
Worst cheater of the Kennedys.

05:01.101 --> 05:04.503
He'd kill his own mother
to get his skinny ass
in the White House.

only five points behind

SAM: I just don't
trust this kid.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.950
Okay, then why don't you
ask him to take
a lie detector test?

05:18.952 --> 05:23.088
'Cause I don't want to waste
my time gathering evidence
that's not admissible.

05:23.090 --> 05:26.758
And not taking a polygraph?
That's wasting time.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.326
You could eliminate him.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.261
This is the 20th century, Sam.
All the big boys
are using them.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.730
I hate the 20th century, okay?
Here's how you're
gonna handle him.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.499
-Me?
-Yeah. He's already got his
defenses up with me.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.301
What I want you to do is,
I want you to...

05:36.303 --> 05:38.503
I know, I know.
The doughnuts, to relax him.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.472
No. The doughnuts
are to fortify you.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.040
You look dead on your feet.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.108
Act like you think
he's innocent.

05:43.110 --> 05:46.178
If I think he's innocent,
then why am I questioning him?

05:46.180 --> 05:47.245
Because I'm making you.

05:47.247 --> 05:47.813
Bitch and moan about it.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.915
If he buys that you think
you're wasting your time,

05:49.917 --> 05:51.783
maybe he'll slip up.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.125
Okay, (CLEARS THROAT)
I'm gonna level with you.

06:00.127 --> 06:03.695
You want to know
the real reason
why you are here?

Give the guy a break, Hodiak.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.751
He can't answer
a few simple questions
without a lawyer?

06:25.753 --> 06:28.220
Okay, now,
I definitely want to talk
to my lawyer.

06:28.222 --> 06:29.654
You get a lawyer,
you get arrested.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.790
You get arrested,
you get a record.

06:31.792 --> 06:36.194
Innocent or not. And trust me,
you do not want
to go through that.

older than Tina?

You would've been graduating
college when she was
still at Pineland, right?

Vineland. Vineland High.

now you forgot,

08:19.066 --> 08:21.766

I had Lyons intercept his
lawyer. Told him his client
was being arraigned.

That's a nutty lie.
We haven't even booked him.
We haven't even arrested him.

A nutty lie? (LAUGHS)
It's not even a lie.

08:33.514 --> 08:37.382

Thought he said his client's
name was Ben Wheeler.

this morning. He's being
arraigned downtown now.

09:04.177 --> 09:07.045
Get it to me. I'll call him.
We'll play them
against each other.

09:07.047 --> 09:07.712
-Here's how.
-I know.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.382
Only way to get you
off my back is for me
to talk to his buddy.

09:10.384 --> 09:14.419
That's good.
But no, here's the real play.

-His doughnut?
-Yeah. Yeah.

He's keeping it.
Some kind of security thing.

He's holding it in reserve
or something,
making him feel safe.

You go in there,
ask him about
his high school buddy,

09:26.166 --> 09:28.099
then take a big bite
of his doughnut.

Hey, Samuel.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.859
What the hell you doing
holed up here?

09:54.861 --> 09:57.028
Don't tell me the union
actually likes Bobby.

09:57.030 --> 10:00.966
(LAUGHS) You're damn right.
He's our best shot
to beat tricky Dick.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.969
But Bobby blows
with the wind. You know,
he started the Vietnam war

10:03.971 --> 10:06.738
with his brother
and then he handed
the hot potato over to LBJ,

10:06.740 --> 10:10.141
and now he turns around
and accuses Johnson
of being a baby-killer.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.143
Exactly, Bobby's a winner.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.111
That's another reason
I called.

10:13.113 --> 10:18.984
We're gonna need help.
I wanted to hire you with
Bobby's security here in LA.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.652
Sorry, I can't moonlight.

10:20.654 --> 10:21.820
It's one night. Why not?

10:25.459 --> 10:26.458
Make three times the money.

10:26.460 --> 10:29.427
(STAMMERS) I can't.
I got to get back.
I'm sweating a suspect.

10:29.429 --> 10:32.130
So let him sweat
for another minute.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.133
I got trouble, Sam.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.770
I'm being blackmailed
by a hooker,

10:38.772 --> 10:43.842
and I know it is ridiculous
to be scared of a whore,

10:44.311 --> 10:45.877
but if she tells Mary...

10:45.879 --> 10:49.247
(STAMMERS)
I just can't let
that happen, Sam.

10:49.249 --> 10:52.917
She's threatening
to tell Mary?
Not the union?

10:52.919 --> 10:55.954
Ah. The union? The union
doesn't give a fart.

she's put on 60 pounds.
She'd rather have
a doughnut than me.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.399
So,

11:07.634 --> 11:08.466
(SIGHS)

11:08.468 --> 11:12.303
I go to hookers,
and I pick Irish girls because

11:12.305 --> 11:16.341
they remind me of Mary,
before she was, you know.

11:16.576 --> 11:17.876
You're sentimental.

11:17.878 --> 11:23.014
Well, there are these
two particular lassies
I like,

and I've been seeing
them kind of regular,

11:27.120 --> 11:28.453
so it's got to be one of them.

only two lasses?

you know me too well.

two that I was dumb enough
to talk to about Mary.

from these letters,

11:41.034 --> 11:45.170
the blackmailer knows
how I feel about my marriage,

11:45.172 --> 11:47.305
so find out which hooker, Sam.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.707
Find her,

and, uh, make her stop.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.618
Hey!

12:01.321 --> 12:01.786
(SNIFFLES)

12:01.788 --> 12:04.189
Hodiak says I've got to talk
to your high school buddy,

12:04.191 --> 12:06.124
and then we're in good shape.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.026
What's his name?

12:08.028 --> 12:11.329
Or you want me to tell him
that you refused?

12:12.899 --> 12:14.132
Okay.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.734
Your funeral.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.237
Hey! Hey.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.375
It's Phil Gleason.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.779
I'll get you his phone number.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.215
(GUITAR PLAYING)

12:30.217 --> 12:35.653
Dennis, come on, man.
Gotta go. Got to catch a plane
to Frisco. Let's do it.

12:35.756 --> 12:40.391
Hey, Terry.
You got time
for one song, man.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.928
You promised, right, Terry?

12:44.097 --> 12:44.696
Promise of your manhood.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.931
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man. Sure.
Be happy to listen.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.299
I'll be back Tuesday
for the primary, okay?

12:48.301 --> 12:51.836
You should play at my guy's
victory celebration,
election night.

12:51.838 --> 12:52.270
Right on.

12:52.272 --> 12:56.541
I'm late, man. Sorry.
Got to go. Come on, guys.
Got to go! Frisco.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.384
Grace?

13:06.853 --> 13:11.322
Grace, can you introduce
Mrs. Nixon before lunch?

13:11.758 --> 13:12.423
Me? Why?

13:12.425 --> 13:16.327
Well, Bunny Sturdevant's plane
is delayed. Someone's got
to introduce her.

13:16.329 --> 13:20.031
You know her, right?
Your husband works for Dick.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.635
(CHUCKLES) No, no, Becky,
you're the secretary.

13:23.637 --> 13:28.039
I can't. I break out in hives
if I have to speak in public.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.541
Please, Grace, please.

13:29.543 --> 13:30.809
Oh, I don't know.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.577
You know Pat, right?

13:35.348 --> 13:37.215
I've met her
a couple of times.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.284
Great. You're elected.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.655
He's sticking to his story.
He never met Tina.

13:43.657 --> 13:44.355
You call Gleason's number?

13:44.357 --> 13:47.892
Yeah, I just called. I got
an answering service.
Left a message.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.260
(SHUDDERING)
Jeez, it's cold, right?

13:49.262 --> 13:54.065
Listen, Healy's done.
He put his head down,
passed out.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.768
What's the next?
Beat him with a phone book?

13:56.770 --> 13:57.335
(LAUGHS)

13:57.337 --> 13:59.304
-You're sick.
-I'm the sick one?

13:59.306 --> 14:03.942
No, no, no. You're hot.
You got a fever.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.577
You got something.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.645
This ain't the flu.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.615
Huh?

14:15.622 --> 14:18.423
No, you should go home.
You're gonna infect everybody.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.825
Look, just go home.
I'll take over with him.

14:20.827 --> 14:24.529
But you get out of here.
Take care of yourself. Go.

14:25.732 --> 14:28.233
Hello. I'm Grace Karn.

14:32.939 --> 14:34.472
(CLAPPING)

14:37.577 --> 14:42.113
You know, I remember
the first time I realized,

14:42.115 --> 14:44.816
well, not realized,
(CHUCKLES)

14:45.285 --> 14:48.653
but came to understand
who Pat Nixon is.

14:50.023 --> 14:54.826
I was a young mother
of an adorable 2-year-old,

14:54.828 --> 14:58.730
who, let's be honest,
was running me ragged.
(CHUCKLES)

14:58.732 --> 15:00.231
(SCATTERED LAUGHTER)

15:00.667 --> 15:06.537
And when I heard
Vice President Nixon
explain about Pat's

15:07.474 --> 15:11.643
respectable Republican
cloth coat

15:11.645 --> 15:17.181
and how much their
two little girls loved their
cocker spaniel, Checkers,

15:19.019 --> 15:20.919
I don't know. I just...

15:22.789 --> 15:26.891
I got so vivid
a picture of a family.

15:28.295 --> 15:32.830
A modest,
hard-working American family.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.367
And it made me proud.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.605
Not only proud
to be a Republican,

15:40.607 --> 15:45.610
not only proud to be
a citizen of the greatest
democracy on Earth,

15:46.646 --> 15:50.515
but proud to be
a Republican wife and mother.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.583
(APPLAUSE)

15:59.125 --> 16:02.827
Change of shift.
You got me for
the next 12 hours.

16:02.829 --> 16:05.863
This is the United States.
You can't keep me
here forever.

16:05.865 --> 16:08.399
I guess you're the expert
on what cops can and can't do.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.903
What do I know?
Oh. I will tell you
what I do know.

16:11.905 --> 16:17.342
Your high school buddy
got back to me. He's gonna
be here in 15 minutes.

16:17.444 --> 16:18.743
Really?

16:19.412 --> 16:22.914
Now, talking to a pretty
high school girl
ain't a crime.

16:22.916 --> 16:25.149
But lying to me
about it is, kid.

16:25.151 --> 16:30.021
Now, it's up to you to decide
whether or not it's smart
to stick to your story.

16:30.023 --> 16:33.324
Because when your
buddy gets here,
and tells me different,

16:33.326 --> 16:36.094
then you are going
to stay here.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.429
Forever.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.699
He's here. Mr. Gleason's here.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.237
Last chance.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.912
I got nothing to say.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.419
Mr. Gleason. Detective Hodiak.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.723
You didn't go to high school
with Ben Healy.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.127
-You're his lawyer.
-And his uncle.

17:09.229 --> 17:12.063
After you dragged
my nephew in here
last time, I told Ben,

17:12.065 --> 17:15.633
"Cops show up again,
keep your mouth shut
and call me."

17:15.635 --> 17:16.968
Ben's a smart boy.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.202
SAM: Maybe.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.437
But you're stupid.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.471
You gave him stupid advice.

17:20.473 --> 17:23.074
He got you here by lying
to a police officer.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.609
That's obstruction of justice.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.176
Charge him, detective.

17:25.178 --> 17:30.415
You've held my nephew here
for over 24 hours.
Is he under arrest?

17:32.452 --> 17:33.317
Meg?

17:33.319 --> 17:38.122
Take this man to see
his nephew, or his client,
or whoever he is.

17:38.124 --> 17:40.825
And for the record,
Healy was never under arrest,

17:40.827 --> 17:42.260
and nobody told him
he was, ever.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.561
Or led him to believe he was?

17:43.563 --> 17:46.130
I'll be filing
an official complaint
about this, detective.

17:46.132 --> 17:47.565
Yeah, I'm the one
who has a complaint.

17:47.567 --> 17:51.402
Your client's way too smart
to be innocent.

17:52.906 --> 17:57.942
We were all so touched
when you said you were proud
to be a wife and mother.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.043
I mean, Bunny's a pistol,

17:59.045 --> 18:01.712
but when we elect
a new California
chapter president,

18:01.714 --> 18:04.449
it would be terrific
to have somebody like you

18:04.451 --> 18:07.151
who could talk about the joys,
the hard work and,

18:07.153 --> 18:10.354
how did you put it?
Raising your girl.

18:10.356 --> 18:15.393
Uh. Well... She was a handful.
Ran me ragged.

18:15.395 --> 18:21.232
(LAUGHS) Perfect. They do
run us ragged. But what job
could be more important?

18:22.035 --> 18:24.001

18:25.205 --> 18:26.537
(STAMMERS) Uh... She's 17.

18:26.539 --> 18:31.609
And still your baby, right?
And where is she? In college?

18:32.779 --> 18:36.714
Emma! Good day, sunshine!

18:37.550 --> 18:38.483
Wakey, wakey.

18:38.485 --> 18:42.587

I need you, Cherry.
Gregg's here.

18:43.356 --> 18:47.191

with no chick he likes.

18:49.896 --> 18:56.667
See, Sadie, Patty and Minnie,
all wrong. Gregg wants
my sweet Cherry pop.

18:56.970 --> 19:03.875
Which is fine. 'Cause he's
gonna give you the answer
to the riddle of Melcher.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.210
He's sure to know.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.579
Know what?

19:11.885 --> 19:12.750
I...

19:12.752 --> 19:14.919
I told you. Gene McCarthy,

19:14.921 --> 19:20.992
and Bobby Kennedy
are running to be dictator
of the jailed world.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.760
Terry likes one of them,

19:22.762 --> 19:27.932
and we have a chance
to play for him,
if I can find out which one.

Here on a case.
Going back in a week.

20:31.564 --> 20:35.199

because of the
California primary.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.702

Good work if you can get it.

the Republican nomination
sewn up.

20:44.043 --> 20:47.945
Well, we're not worried
about the nomination.

20:47.947 --> 20:52.183
We're worried about
facing Bobby Kennedy
in the general.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.485
I'm sure J. Edgar
must be unhappy

20:54.487 --> 20:58.289
at the prospect of
Bobby becoming president.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.058
If he's elected,
Hoover could be out.

you're after, Ken?

More than happy to
help you hurt Bobby.

he went back to the school,

26:24.584 --> 26:26.817
He placed
the ads you answered.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.252
At least he is Irish.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.688
And you think
he's the blackmailer?

26:30.690 --> 26:31.655
Gotta be.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.290
The girls would
never blackmail a client

26:33.292 --> 26:35.192
without his say-so.
He'd kill 'em.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.194
Why would this O'Reilly
wanna blackmail me?

26:37.196 --> 26:40.831
That's the mystery.
You're too good
a client to blow up.

26:40.833 --> 26:43.267
O'Reilly is generous
with the right people at vice,

26:43.269 --> 26:45.803
but if I turn up
the heat that'll change.

26:45.805 --> 26:48.405
I'll talk to him
and he will stop.

26:48.407 --> 26:50.808
Thanks, Sam. You really...
(CHUCKLES)

26:50.810 --> 26:52.910
You really are saving my life.

26:53.646 --> 26:54.845
WOMAN: Senator!
A moment of your time.

26:54.847 --> 26:59.016
Senator, Senator!
Uh, there's someone here
I want to introduce.

26:59.018 --> 26:59.917
No, Sean...

26:59.919 --> 27:02.486
Uh, Senator Kennedy,
this is the old war

27:02.488 --> 27:03.854
buddy of mine I was
talking to you about.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.857
He's LA's top
homicide detective,
Samson Hodiak.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.660
None of that is true.
But it's a pleasure
to meet you.

27:09.662 --> 27:11.462
And I'll give
your hand a rest.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.330
It looks like...
I'll save your hand.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.599
Well, thanks.
Campaigning's not
hard labor,

27:15.601 --> 27:18.202
but it isn't
easy on the hands.

27:18.371 --> 27:20.638
Detective,
you're law enforcement.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.072
-(CAMERA CLICKS)
-Let me ask you,

27:22.074 --> 27:24.108
especially here
in Los Angeles,

27:24.110 --> 27:25.209
what, in your opinion,

27:25.211 --> 27:27.044
can be done to
improve relations

27:27.046 --> 27:29.913
with the black community
on both sides?

27:30.850 --> 27:33.550
I don't really
have any ideas, sir.

27:33.719 --> 27:35.552
Be blunt with me.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.958
Nothing, sir.
Nothing can be done.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.093
Nothing?

27:43.095 --> 27:44.528
SAM: People don't change.

27:44.530 --> 27:45.596
There are good
ones and bad ones.

27:45.598 --> 27:49.466
It's my job to
keep the bad away
from the good.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.735
That's all I can do.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.039
Well, I disagree.

27:55.041 --> 27:57.441
But you're right.
Your job isn't
to change people,

27:57.443 --> 27:59.543
but you supply
the most important service

27:59.545 --> 28:01.979
a government can
provide to its citizens.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.247
Justice.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.848
That's what
makes 'em change.

28:04.850 --> 28:09.753
Now, I insist.
You're too important a man
to skip shaking hands with.

28:30.910 --> 28:34.244
If you want privacy,
shut the door.

28:36.649 --> 28:38.749
What do you want, Grace?

28:40.986 --> 28:42.753
Bunny Sturdevant's
been elected president

28:42.755 --> 28:46.090
of the National Federation
of Republican Women.

28:46.092 --> 28:48.792
That leaves
the California chair vacant.

28:48.794 --> 28:53.564
I wanna replace her.
Will you help me
make that happen?

28:54.200 --> 28:55.532
Sure.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.702
I'd like to. How can I?

28:58.804 --> 29:01.839
Bunny nominating me
would help.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.140
She won't?

29:03.142 --> 29:05.509
She thinks of me
as a housewife.

29:07.413 --> 29:10.748
I'll tell Haldeman
to educate her.

29:11.383 --> 29:12.816
Thanks.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.352
You're welcome.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.724
Ken, what should
I say about Emma?

29:20.726 --> 29:22.926
They all ask about her.
What do I tell them?

29:22.928 --> 29:24.428
What we tell
the people at the club.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.196
Emma's taking
a year in Europe.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.264
Well, what will
I say after a year?

29:27.266 --> 29:30.734
She's married,
on the East Coast.
I don't know.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.604
They'll stop asking.

29:40.479 --> 29:43.981
You know,
I'm really interested, Ken,

29:44.250 --> 29:46.350
in your political work.

29:46.652 --> 29:49.119
Happy to be a sounding board.

29:49.355 --> 29:50.821
I used to be.

29:50.823 --> 29:53.991
I'd like us to be
close again, Grace.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.531
You've been doing
a lot of research on Kennedy.

30:00.533 --> 30:03.667
You really think
he can win the nomination?

30:06.305 --> 30:07.571
Yeah.

30:07.573 --> 30:10.340
He's by far the most
charismatic candidate.

30:10.342 --> 30:15.345
He's got his
daddy's ruthlessness,
his brother's good looks,

30:16.549 --> 30:20.250
and something vital
for a leader to have.

30:20.452 --> 30:21.819
What's that?

30:22.321 --> 30:25.189
He knows what
it is to be hurt.

30:25.991 --> 30:29.693
He had a terrible time
after his brother's
assassination.

30:29.695 --> 30:31.128
Holds himself responsible,

30:31.130 --> 30:34.765
told his friends,
"I have blood on my hands."

30:35.434 --> 30:37.301
He's suffered.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.437
You almost sound
as if you like him.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.606
No, no, no.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.875
I can't stand his politics.

30:57.389 --> 31:01.491
It's a nice car.
Can I see the inside of it?

31:01.493 --> 31:05.295
I'd have to be nuts,
detective,
to blackmail a client.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.464
Especially an oil
well like your friend.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.399
Oil's been seeing
my girls three times

31:09.401 --> 31:10.234
a week for two years.

31:10.236 --> 31:13.136
Three times a week?
At 100 bucks a pop?

31:13.138 --> 31:15.505
These are fresh girls,
right off the bus

31:15.507 --> 31:17.975
from the Midwest.
Pink all over.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.309
And they all think
they're actresses,

31:19.311 --> 31:23.146
so they're happy
to play any part
you like, detective.

31:23.148 --> 31:24.615
On the house.

31:24.817 --> 31:25.682
Hmm.

31:25.684 --> 31:29.419
Well, unfortunately,
now that you've made
that very generous offer,

31:29.421 --> 31:31.521
I can't not hit you.

31:32.291 --> 31:32.589
Pardon?

31:32.591 --> 31:35.626
That's a double negative,
so I understand
that can be confusing.

31:35.628 --> 31:37.794
What I mean to say is

31:37.796 --> 31:39.029
(GRUNTS)

31:41.166 --> 31:43.433
you're still a pimp.

31:54.546 --> 31:59.883
Clean Gene, baby Bobby,
they're both against the war.

31:59.885 --> 32:01.084
Tricky Dick, too.

32:01.086 --> 32:04.388
Even Humpty Dumpty
has a peace plan.

32:04.390 --> 32:04.855
(SIGHS)

32:04.857 --> 32:06.790
You mean everyone's
against the war?

32:06.792 --> 32:09.626
They call for peace.
Peace, peace.

32:09.628 --> 32:14.398
-But all they do is
make war, war, war!
-(BANGS ON TABLE)

32:15.367 --> 32:17.768
They're insane, Cherry.

32:17.903 --> 32:22.439
All of the would-be
kings are mad.

32:26.211 --> 32:27.311
Read it.

32:27.313 --> 32:28.946
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

32:28.948 --> 32:30.347
Sam, what are you doing here?

32:30.349 --> 32:31.648
It's not the pimp.

32:31.650 --> 32:34.084
Hey, Mary's here.

32:35.220 --> 32:36.853
Three times
a week for two years?

32:36.855 --> 32:38.855
There's no way that
pimp's blackmailing you.

32:38.857 --> 32:39.423
You're his pension fund.

32:39.425 --> 32:42.492
It's gotta be
somebody else close to you.
Maybe somebody in the union.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.361
Some buddy that sees you
sneak out three times a week?

32:44.363 --> 32:48.031
What do you think,
I share the intimate
details of my married life

32:48.033 --> 32:49.466
-with a shop steward?
-What details?

32:49.468 --> 32:50.400
All the letters say
is that you go to whores

32:50.402 --> 32:53.136
because you can't stand
touching your wife anymore.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.404
Do you have to be so loud?

32:54.406 --> 32:56.273
I only confessed
that to the whores.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.742
MARY: Your new
flunky's on the phone.

32:58.944 --> 33:00.110
He says he needs you.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.211
Oh, yeah, I gotta take that.

33:01.213 --> 33:04.781
Ah, you remember Sam Hodiak.
We served together.

33:07.619 --> 33:08.885
Do you want some coffee?
It's a fresh pot.

33:08.887 --> 33:12.322
No, thank you.
I've actually gotta
get going.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.827
You're a detective, right?

33:16.829 --> 33:17.361
Guilty.

33:17.363 --> 33:22.966
What a handy friend to have.
A man who can
lock up your enemies.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.904
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

33:37.449 --> 33:39.616
Mary, I gotta go, uh...

33:39.785 --> 33:40.884
Sam, can I walk
you to your car?

33:40.886 --> 33:44.855
No, I'm actually...
I'm gonna have a cup
of coffee with Mary.

33:44.957 --> 33:45.789
Oh.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.991
Okay. I'll see you later.

33:54.600 --> 33:59.336
I bore him four children,
and he won't even
kiss me on the lips.

34:01.240 --> 34:04.074
Are you gonna tell him,
or should I?

34:05.744 --> 34:08.578
Is he suffering
all day long?

34:08.580 --> 34:10.547
I think you've
made your point.

34:10.549 --> 34:11.982
No, no.

34:11.984 --> 34:15.018
When you tell him
that all his scrambling

34:15.020 --> 34:18.889
to hide his whoring from me
was a pathetic farce,

34:18.891 --> 34:21.525
that's when
I've made my point.

34:29.001 --> 34:30.967
I wanna get you in the studio.

34:30.969 --> 34:31.735
I'm serious.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.237
-Your voice is amazing.
-(CHUCKLES) You're crazy.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.405
I can get you in.

34:35.407 --> 34:36.706
-Yeah.
-We'll do a duet.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.809
-A duet? What?
-Yeah, me and you.

34:38.811 --> 34:40.944
-With me?
-Of course.

34:40.946 --> 34:42.412
Hmm.

34:47.853 --> 34:50.087
It's ready, Dennis.

34:50.289 --> 34:52.055
My new song.

Charlie, man,
you gotta play that for Terry.

37:01.520 --> 37:05.522
Look, if he won't
record it for you,
man, I will.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.390
Great, uh...

37:07.659 --> 37:09.092
I wanna play for Terry now.

37:09.094 --> 37:13.163
Right now.
Let's go to that party,
and I'll play.

37:15.467 --> 37:16.233
Which...

37:16.235 --> 37:19.936
Which one does he like?
Gene or Bobby?

37:20.038 --> 37:21.905
Terry said that
he likes the dude

37:21.907 --> 37:24.507
who really, really hates,

37:24.509 --> 37:28.812
I mean,
just really hates the war.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.750
Well, that's Bobby.

37:34.786 --> 37:38.021
Nobody hates
the war more than Bobby.

BRIAN: <i> Average height.</i>
<i> Black hair.</i>

37:42.394 --> 37:43.326
Yeah, like, chunky.

37:43.328 --> 37:47.197
Last three days, raven hair?
That's black hair.

37:47.199 --> 37:49.499
Got a missing person for you.

37:49.501 --> 37:52.269
Disappeared without a trace.

and Charlie.

38:18.830 --> 38:19.829
(CHUCKLES)
What are y'all doing here?

38:19.831 --> 38:23.133
You just missed
the wizards of Kalamazoo.
They just played.

38:23.135 --> 38:25.035
More zoo than wizard.

38:25.037 --> 38:26.970
How come you're making
this scene?

38:26.972 --> 38:28.438
Charlie's got
a great new tune, man.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.440
He's here to
play it for Terry.

38:30.442 --> 38:31.775
Well, Terry's not here.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.743
No, I saw him last
night and I asked him.

38:33.745 --> 38:35.612
Terry likes Gene McCarthy
because he was

38:35.614 --> 38:38.682
the first to come
out against the war.

38:38.684 --> 38:39.849
Where's that?

38:39.851 --> 38:41.651
We'll go there.
I'll play there.

38:41.653 --> 38:45.221
GREGG: Melcher won't be
there now. McCarthy lost.

38:45.223 --> 38:47.490
No, Melcher
will be long gone.

on your victory.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.381
(ALL CHEERING)

39:11.383 --> 39:14.984
Thank you, buddy.
I am so glad you
joined the team.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.821
We're going all the way,
and you're the guy
that's gonna make it...

39:17.823 --> 39:20.090
I'm not here to be
a bodyguard, Sean.

39:20.092 --> 39:21.391
You know why I'm here.

39:21.393 --> 39:24.361
Martin O'Reilly,
the pimp, is missing.

39:24.363 --> 39:26.429
Good.
You probably scared him off.

39:26.431 --> 39:29.866
Where'd your
genius boys bury him?
I hope it's not the tar pits.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.001
Come on. Why would I
bother with that scum?

39:32.003 --> 39:34.170
You yourself said he
wasn't responsible.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.405
And by the time
I told you that,

39:35.407 --> 39:36.940
it was too late to
call your boys off.

39:36.942 --> 39:39.476
There must have been
1,000 guys who wanted
to kill that creep.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.378
Would you stop with that,
or I will pound

39:41.380 --> 39:42.045
you into the ground.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.580
I'd like to see
you try that, Sam.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.548
I may look like
I've gotten soft,

39:45.550 --> 39:46.850
but you're gonna
have to prove that.

39:46.852 --> 39:49.919
I fingered him for you.
You used me!

39:51.356 --> 39:53.690
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

39:54.159 --> 39:56.593
Okay, Sam. Okay! Look,

39:57.329 --> 40:00.130
it was a mistake
all around, okay?

40:00.132 --> 40:02.766
But really, is the world
that much worse off

40:02.768 --> 40:04.667
'cause a pimp is dead?

40:06.838 --> 40:09.906
It's Mary. The blackmailer.

40:09.908 --> 40:10.840
What?

40:10.842 --> 40:11.841
The blackmailer is your wife!

40:11.843 --> 40:14.344
I can't...
Why would she blackmail me?

40:14.346 --> 40:16.646
It's a sham.
She knows all about
your whoring,

40:16.648 --> 40:19.015
and she wants
to see you suffer.

40:19.017 --> 40:21.484
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

40:25.791 --> 40:28.691
Just wait here.
Wait here for a second.

40:28.994 --> 40:30.226
What?

40:31.730 --> 40:33.430
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

40:33.765 --> 40:35.899
All right.
Hold on a second.

40:35.901 --> 40:39.135
Sam, we can't take
Bobby out the front.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.905
This crowd is too big.
It's too out of control.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.606
You've got to help us, please.

40:43.608 --> 40:46.776
He's gonna be the next
president, Sammy.

40:47.712 --> 40:49.646
All right.
I know this hotel.

40:49.648 --> 40:51.681
Get the cars around to
the service entrance.

40:51.683 --> 40:54.250
We'll take Kennedy out
through the kitchen.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.618
All right.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.654
(CAMERA CLICKS)

40:57.789 --> 40:58.721
Good to see you again,
detective.

40:58.723 --> 41:02.225
Congratulations on
your victory, Senator.
Follow me.

41:02.694 --> 41:05.728
Good luck, sir.

41:07.532 --> 41:09.232
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

41:09.234 --> 41:11.401
BOBBY: Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

41:11.403 --> 41:13.803
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.505
Thank you.

41:16.441 --> 41:17.674
Thanks.

41:19.444 --> 41:21.377
(CAMERA FLASHES)

41:23.815 --> 41:25.281
-Good luck, sir.
-Thank you.

41:25.283 --> 41:27.383
Thanks for your support.

41:28.420 --> 41:29.786
Thank you.

41:51.443 --> 41:53.510
(WOMEN SCREAMING)

41:55.914 --> 41:57.480
(GUNSHOT)

41:59.518 --> 42:03.586
Murder! Murder!

42:03.588 --> 42:05.655
Murder!

42:05.657 --> 42:08.191
Death. Bloody...

42:09.761 --> 42:12.095
Blood!
