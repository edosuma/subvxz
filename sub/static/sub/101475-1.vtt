popular but they listen to you.

1:03:56.931 --> 1:03:58.134

1:04:16.251 --> 1:04:19.021
I just wanna be one of
the fuckin' bros again.

1:04:23.125 --> 1:04:27.630
If you quit, you're gonna
take me down with you.

1:04:34.001 --> 1:04:38.007
If you do that, I'll
never fuckin' forgive you.

1:04:41.809 --> 1:04:43.880
Beast fuckin' out.

1:05:12.273 --> 1:05:13.509

Moses, not you, not us,

1:05:26.922 --> 1:05:28.690
I'll run shit right.

1:05:31.059 --> 1:05:32.628
You aint got a fuckin' shot.

1:05:33.762 --> 1:05:35.197
Quit sergeant, bro.

1:05:37.599 --> 1:05:38.601
I'll let you stay.

1:05:40.268 --> 1:05:41.269
Walk away.

1:05:42.903 --> 1:05:44.671
You're still fuckin' sergeant

1:05:44.673 --> 1:05:47.043
when I take over
fuckin' President,

1:05:48.876 --> 1:05:52.114
I'm personally gonna
fuck you up myself.

1:05:57.920 --> 1:06:00.021
Stay mighty, bro.

1:06:44.833 --> 1:06:46.001
Boy!

1:06:46.067 --> 1:06:48.471
Clean this fuckin' shit up.

Fuckin' little faggot.

1:07:11.559 --> 1:07:13.626

1:07:13.628 --> 1:07:14.630
I can't!

1:07:17.632 --> 1:07:20.135
What the fuck did you say?

1:07:21.570 --> 1:07:23.572
You fuckin' little cunt!

1:07:36.918 --> 1:07:39.355
Get the fuck in there!

1:07:39.987 --> 1:07:41.489
What do you want?

1:07:44.125 --> 1:07:45.628
All those cunts,

1:07:46.295 --> 1:07:47.363
all those cunts!

1:07:48.097 --> 1:07:49.098
They're testing you,

1:07:49.965 --> 1:07:51.800
you're weak, they'll
fuck with you.

1:07:53.235 --> 1:07:54.437
What's this mean?

1:07:56.170 --> 1:07:57.739
It means don't fuck with me.

1:07:59.141 --> 1:08:03.445
Your mana, your rep,
that's all you fuckin' got,

1:08:05.213 --> 1:08:08.250
so you step up and be
fuckin' Savage.

1:08:32.942 --> 1:08:33.975

Thought you might wanna
go for a fuckin' beer.

1:09:20.055 --> 1:09:21.257
So how's mum?

1:09:25.793 --> 1:09:26.795
Yeah, she's good.

1:09:27.962 --> 1:09:29.632
Got rid of dad a few years back.

1:09:30.899 --> 1:09:31.901
Very good.

1:09:36.639 --> 1:09:37.640
You wanna see her?

1:09:39.073 --> 1:09:40.275
No.

1:09:47.716 --> 1:09:49.385
What you up to now?

1:09:50.719 --> 1:09:54.422
Got a family, you?

1:10:01.695 --> 1:10:02.698
Lover?

1:10:04.798 --> 1:10:05.935
Don't hold back, bro.

1:10:07.603 --> 1:10:08.770
Ask me anything.

1:10:25.253 --> 1:10:26.488
Your niece.

1:10:36.030 --> 1:10:39.301
Got a good missus,
beautiful girl.

1:10:43.171 --> 1:10:44.606
Soul mate type, you know.

1:10:47.140 --> 1:10:48.710
Yeah well I fucked it all up,

1:10:50.545 --> 1:10:52.881
Didn't handle my shit and
she took off with Kayla.

1:10:54.481 --> 1:10:56.551
Said she'd take me
back if I sort it,

1:10:58.252 --> 1:11:00.688
get out of all this shit
and see a counsellor.

1:11:02.189 --> 1:11:04.960
So I'm workin' on it.

1:11:06.127 --> 1:11:08.364

old stuff, you know?

1:11:11.265 --> 1:11:12.800

1:11:23.811 --> 1:11:25.948
Get the fuck out and
don't come back.

1:11:26.814 --> 1:11:28.016
Mum doesn't wanna see you.

1:11:36.958 --> 1:11:37.960
Why would she, hmm?

1:11:39.560 --> 1:11:41.297
You're just like the old man.

1:11:50.838 --> 1:11:54.710
Everyone can see who you are and
you're fuckin' disgusting!

1:11:57.444 --> 1:12:00.014
Get out of

1:12:56.337 --> 1:12:57.573
