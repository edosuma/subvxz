WEBVTT

00:06.289 --> 00:07.278
[SNIFFS]

00:07.457 --> 00:09.254
Smell that?

00:09.926 --> 00:12.520
That's the smell of new comic books.

00:13.897 --> 00:15.990
Oh, yes.

00:17.434 --> 00:19.095
They're on me today, boys.

00:19.536 --> 00:23.267
You're paying?
Have you been selling your sperm again?

00:24.040 --> 00:25.632
No, I'm celebrating.

00:25.809 --> 00:29.472
As we speak, the space shuttle is docking
at the International Space Station...

00:29.646 --> 00:34.174
...where it will deploy the Wolowitz
Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.

00:34.350 --> 00:37.217
Oh, get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.

00:38.588 --> 00:40.522
Just think, thanks to your hard work...

00:40.690 --> 00:45.992
...an international crew of astronauts will
boldly go where no man has gone before.

00:46.429 --> 00:48.693
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- I believe it is.

00:48.865 --> 00:51.265
The <i>Star Trek</i> reference
and the play on words...

00:51.434 --> 00:53.527
...involving the double meaning
of "to go" ...

00:53.703 --> 00:57.833
...suggest that Leonard is humorously
mocking your efforts in space plumbing.

00:58.007 --> 01:00.999
Okay, make your little jokes.
But of the four of us...

01:01.177 --> 01:05.307
...l'm the only one making any real-world
contribution to science and technology.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.280
He's right. This is an important
achievement for two reasons:

01:08.451 --> 01:10.646
Number one, and of course, number two.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.981
[LAUGHING]

01:13.490 --> 01:15.287
Oh, clever.

01:15.458 --> 01:19.258
Playing on the use of cardinal numbers
as euphemisms for bodily functions.

01:19.429 --> 01:20.760
[LAUGHS]

01:24.134 --> 01:26.500
Here, Sheldon.
I pulled the new <i>Hellboy</i> for you.

01:26.669 --> 01:28.159
It's mind-blowing.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.364
Excuse me, spoiler alert.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.706
But I didn't spoil anything.

01:33.877 --> 01:37.506
You told me it's mind-blowing,
so my mind is going into it pre-blown.

01:38.248 --> 01:41.183
And once a mind is pre-blown,
it cannot be re-blown.

01:41.718 --> 01:44.881
- I'm sorry.
- Said the Grinch to Christmas.

01:48.258 --> 01:51.193
- Hey, can I talk to you about something?
- Sure. What's up?

01:51.361 --> 01:53.886
Remember I went out with Penny
a couple weeks ago?

01:54.063 --> 01:56.725
- Yeah, vaguely.
- Sure, you remember. That was the night...

01:56.900 --> 02:01.030
...you went to the bar and made a fool of
yourself trying to pick up strange women.

02:03.773 --> 02:05.365
What about it?

02:05.875 --> 02:09.038
Well, the thing is,
the date didn't go that well.

02:09.211 --> 02:12.272
Oh. Too bad. You know--

02:12.482 --> 02:15.178
I guess the thing to do now is,
you know, pick yourself up.

02:15.351 --> 02:17.148
Dust yourself off, forget it. Move on.

02:17.320 --> 02:20.187
- I can't do that.
- Why the hell not?

02:20.657 --> 02:22.955
Because we're going out again tomorrow.

02:23.126 --> 02:24.354
Excuse me, Stuart?

02:24.527 --> 02:26.085
- Have you read the new <i>Flash?</i>
- No.

02:26.262 --> 02:29.754
Well, I have,
and it will knock your socks off.

02:30.834 --> 02:32.301
Good luck getting them back on.

02:36.172 --> 02:38.936
Anyway, I figure this is probably
my last shot with Penny...

02:39.108 --> 02:42.077
- ...and I don't wanna screw it up.
- Oh, nobody wants that.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.371
So here's my question:

02:43.546 --> 02:49.178
It's the second date. You think
she'll be expecting things to get physical?

02:51.788 --> 02:53.415
Oh, gee.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.821
Yeah, my initial reaction is no.

02:56.993 --> 03:00.190
But, you know, let me about it
and get back to you, okay?

03:00.363 --> 03:01.990
Okay. So you'll give me a call?

03:02.165 --> 03:04.258
- Yeah, or you call me.
- Great.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.099
Or nobody calls anyone.

03:08.271 --> 03:12.833
Interesting, Penny's current suitor
asking advice from her former suitor.

03:13.009 --> 03:16.206
Yeah, thanks for closed-captioning
my pain, Raj.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.877
You wanna make sure he gets nowhere
with Penny...

03:19.048 --> 03:22.142
...without jeopardizing your friendship
with either of them?

03:22.318 --> 03:24.013
- I'm listening.
- Just tell him...

03:24.187 --> 03:27.350
...to do everything you've done with her
for the last two years.

03:58.388 --> 03:59.821
- Hey, Leonard.
- Oh, hi.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.388
- How's it going?
- Good, good.

04:01.557 --> 04:03.422
- You?
- Fine.

04:03.593 --> 04:06.528
- Oh, yeah, hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.293
You know your friend Stuart?

04:08.998 --> 04:10.659
Yes.

04:10.934 --> 04:13.164
Well, he asked me out again
and I said yes.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.271
And then I started thinking
maybe I should talk to you first.

04:16.439 --> 04:18.737
- About what?
- Well, does it bother you?

04:18.908 --> 04:20.671
Me going out with one of your friends?

04:20.843 --> 04:25.246
- Because, you know, you and me--
- No. No, that's the past.

04:25.415 --> 04:27.383
I'm really more of a right now
kind of guy.

04:27.550 --> 04:29.814
You know, living in the moment.

04:30.353 --> 04:34.016
Although I do have to live a little
in the future because, well, that's my job.

04:34.524 --> 04:38.517
Of course, my fondness for classic science
fiction does draw my attention backwards...

04:38.695 --> 04:41.528
...but those stories often take place
in the future, so--

04:44.100 --> 04:46.000
In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.

04:48.104 --> 04:50.004
Okay, well, that's really cool of you.

04:50.173 --> 04:52.266
LEONARD:
Yeah? Well, I wouldn't say cool.

04:52.442 --> 04:55.343
I'd just say, "That's Leonard."

04:56.012 --> 04:58.708
Well, in that case,
do you mind giving me some advice?

04:58.881 --> 05:00.143
About Stuart?

05:00.316 --> 05:01.749
Love to.

05:01.918 --> 05:05.376
He's very shy. How do I make him
feel more comfortable around me?

05:05.555 --> 05:09.821
Well, first of all, don't underestimate
the value of discomfort.

05:10.493 --> 05:13.121
- Really?
- Well, yeah. Stuart thrives under pressure.

05:13.296 --> 05:16.060
That's why he works
in a comic-book store.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.827
[PHONE RINGING]

05:22.005 --> 05:23.370

05:23.906 --> 05:25.032
It's Stuart.

[PHONE RINGING]

05:28.644 --> 05:30.544
You're not going to answer it?

05:31.848 --> 05:34.646
He wants to talk about Penny.
I don't wanna talk about Penny.

05:35.451 --> 05:36.816
You're making an assumption.

05:38.388 --> 05:40.549
Perhaps the comic book store is on fire.

05:41.858 --> 05:43.223
And he needs your assistance.

05:43.826 --> 05:45.987
Why would he call me?

05:46.162 --> 05:48.255
We don't know.

05:48.431 --> 05:51.400
And if you don't answer the phone,
we can't know.

05:52.869 --> 05:55.167
I'm not answering the phone, Sheldon.

05:55.338 --> 05:57.238
[PHONE RINGING]

05:59.342 --> 06:01.333

- No.

[PHONE CHIMING]

06:04.147 --> 06:05.774
There. It went to voicemail.

06:12.388 --> 06:14.413
Aren't you going
to check your messages?

06:16.926 --> 06:19.486
- No.
- You have to check your messages.

06:19.662 --> 06:22.426
The leaving of a message
is one half of a social contract...

06:22.598 --> 06:25.294
...which is completed
by the checking of the message.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.696
If that contract breaks down,
then all social contracts break down.

06:29.872 --> 06:32.136
And we descend into anarchy.

06:33.776 --> 06:36.643
It must be hell inside your head.

06:38.748 --> 06:40.648
At times.

06:41.884 --> 06:43.351
Guys, we have a code red.

06:43.519 --> 06:46.249
Code red, the hospital emergency alert?
The computer worm?

06:46.422 --> 06:49.687
Or the cherry-flavored soft drink
from the makers of Mountain Dew?

06:50.493 --> 06:52.984
I was going over the schematics
on my Zero-G Toilet...

06:53.162 --> 06:57.098
...and I made a teeny-tiny mistake
on the specifications for the diverter valve.

06:57.266 --> 06:58.460
How teeny-tiny?

06:58.634 --> 07:00.499
It's gonna fail after about ten flushes.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.466
- But the mission is for six months.
- That's the code red.

07:05.374 --> 07:08.434
It's kind of like a jack-in-the-box.
No one knows exactly when...

07:08.611 --> 07:12.843
...but at some point, something way worse
than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.

07:14.383 --> 07:15.873
Have you notified NASA?

07:16.052 --> 07:18.816
You crazy? What am I gonna say?
I screwed up your toilet...

07:18.988 --> 07:23.084
...and pretty soon there's gonna be crap
floating all over your nice space station?

07:23.259 --> 07:24.283
What are you gonna do?

07:24.460 --> 07:27.020
I'm gonna figure out how to fix it,
then I'll tell them.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.686
So, what do you need us for?

07:28.865 --> 07:31.333
He can't figure out how to fix it.

07:31.734 --> 07:33.531
You said you were gonna be supportive.

07:33.703 --> 07:37.264
I'm trying. But you have to admit,
this is pretty damn funny.

07:38.641 --> 07:39.665
I agree.

07:39.842 --> 07:42.504
It's a juxtaposition of the nature
of space exploration...

07:42.678 --> 07:46.341
...against the banality of a malfunctioning
toilet that provides the comic fodder here.

07:46.516 --> 07:48.006
[LAUGHS]

07:51.320 --> 07:53.015
Check your messages.

07:55.958 --> 08:00.224
All right, this is an exact duplicate
of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity...

08:00.396 --> 08:03.524
...Human Waste Disposal System
as deployed on the Space Station.

08:03.699 --> 08:07.965
Don't you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity
Human Waste Distribution System?

08:09.872 --> 08:12.102
Good one, yeah.

08:13.409 --> 08:14.467
[FAKES LAUGH]

08:14.644 --> 08:16.305
It's hilarious. Now.

08:16.679 --> 08:21.173
Here's an approximation of the spare parts
available on the space station.

08:21.350 --> 08:24.376
We gotta find a way, using nothing but this,
to reinforce this.

08:24.554 --> 08:26.454
So the waste material avoids the turbine.

08:26.622 --> 08:29.182
You mean, so it doesn't hit the fan?

08:33.529 --> 08:38.091
You know, I have to say I thought the toilet
humor would get less funny with repetition.

08:38.267 --> 08:42.465
Apparently, there is no law of diminishing
comedic returns with space poop.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.130
[KNOCKING]

08:47.410 --> 08:48.900
- Hey, Leonard.
- Hey, Stuart.

08:49.078 --> 08:50.511
- You busy?
- Uh--

08:50.680 --> 08:52.477
Classified, Leonard.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.440
Yeah, it's a regular Manhattan Project.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.482
- What's up?
- Well, tonight's my date with Penny.

08:59.655 --> 09:01.748
And we haven't been able to connect
by phone--

09:01.924 --> 09:04.085
- Yeah, I'm sorry. It's been broken.
- Or e-mail.

09:04.260 --> 09:06.728
Yeah, that's broken too.
Everything's broken.

09:07.530 --> 09:11.296
Anyway, I was just wondering
if you had any last-minute advice.

09:11.867 --> 09:14.859
All right. Well, off the top of my head...

09:15.037 --> 09:19.098
...you know, I think the most important
thing with Penny is to go really slow.

09:19.275 --> 09:21.971
I mean, glacial.

09:22.445 --> 09:24.436
- Okay.
- You know, guys come on to her...

09:24.614 --> 09:28.106
...all the time, so you need to, like,
set yourself apart, you know?

09:28.284 --> 09:29.842
Be a little shy.

09:30.019 --> 09:33.819
And don't make too much eye contact.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.390
And you know, treat her with, like,
cool detachment.

09:36.559 --> 09:39.960
And, you know, fear.

09:40.129 --> 09:41.460
- Fear?
LEONARD: Yeah.

09:41.631 --> 09:46.659
Like you're afraid
that if you touch her, she'll break.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.999
Well,
that plays right into my wheelhouse.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.468
Good, good.
Well, you kids have fun tonight.

09:53.643 --> 09:55.110
Thanks, Leonard.

09:55.278 --> 09:56.870
What is that thing anyway?

09:58.014 --> 09:59.481
You don't know what this is?

09:59.649 --> 10:01.583
- No.
- Good, get out.

10:05.187 --> 10:08.816
Be afraid of Penny. Nice, very crafty.

10:08.991 --> 10:13.724
It wasn't bad advice.
It just wasn't particularly helpful.

10:14.230 --> 10:18.166
For what it's worth, my mother says
that when we deceive for personal gain...

10:18.334 --> 10:20.564
...we make Jesus cry.

10:27.977 --> 10:33.938
All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC
to reinforce the center cross-support?

10:34.116 --> 10:37.483
No good. I mean, it might work
for the Japanese and the Americans...

10:37.653 --> 10:40.679
...but have you seen the size
of the Russians they got up there?

10:43.259 --> 10:48.253
This thing has to hold up
against a hearty potato-based diet.

10:48.798 --> 10:50.493
I feel terrible.

10:50.666 --> 10:53.931
Maybe if you were helping,
you'd feel better about yourself.

10:54.470 --> 10:57.837
I deliberately tried to sabotage
Stuart's date with Penny.

10:58.007 --> 11:01.465
Of course you feel terrible. You completely
screwed up your karma, dude.

11:01.644 --> 11:04.112
You don't really believe in that superstition,
do you?

11:04.280 --> 11:07.113
It's not superstition,
it's practically Newtonian.

11:07.683 --> 11:10.117
For every action,
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

11:10.286 --> 11:14.120
Leonard pretends to be a friend,
and acts like a two-faced bitch.

11:16.158 --> 11:19.150
Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug.

11:21.630 --> 11:25.464
It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.

11:25.634 --> 11:28.569
Speaking of what goes around
comes around....

11:29.238 --> 11:30.330
Okay, look.

11:30.506 --> 11:33.270
Instead of trying to reinforce
this structure here...

11:33.442 --> 11:35.876
...what if we ran another line,
bypassed it entirely?

11:36.045 --> 11:38.639
Won't work.
The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.

11:38.814 --> 11:40.805
What if we reposition
the collection tank?

11:40.983 --> 11:42.575
It won't work. No way to mount it.

11:42.752 --> 11:44.845
Here's an idea.
What if I change my name...

11:45.020 --> 11:47.887
...and go live with my cousin
and her husband, Avi, in Israel?

11:50.126 --> 11:51.593
That could work.

11:57.666 --> 11:59.258
- Morning.
- Morning. What's up?

11:59.435 --> 12:04.429
Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter
trying to fix a Zero-Gravity pasta maker.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.676
- I'm gonna make a coffee run. Want any?
- No. I have coffee.

12:09.845 --> 12:12.211
Great,
so how'd it go with Stuart last night?

12:14.216 --> 12:15.911
I really don't wanna talk about it.

12:16.085 --> 12:17.643
Yeah. Right. Sure.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.380
But, you know, the thing is,
before you guys went out...

12:20.556 --> 12:23.354
- I spoke to him and l--
- I said I don't wanna talk about it.

12:23.526 --> 12:25.585
- Okay, I kind of feel res--
- Look, Leonard.

12:25.761 --> 12:29.060
What goes on is none of your business.
So just leave it alone, okay?

12:33.903 --> 12:38.363
If you really want to clean up your karma,
go get my freaking latte.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.514
Hang on, I think I've got this.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.881
Help me see if we can wedge
this piece of PVC behind the support rod.

12:52.054 --> 12:55.717
You're overestimating the strength
of the substructure you're building.

12:55.891 --> 12:59.019
- Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.
- lf you knew what you were doing...

12:59.195 --> 13:02.323
...there wouldn't be a space toilet
where my coffee table should be.

13:03.732 --> 13:05.290
Howard, wait.

13:05.468 --> 13:09.461
Why don't you use this instead of the PVC
to keep the filter assembly in place?

13:09.738 --> 13:12.468
Because this is not a spare part
from the space station.

13:12.641 --> 13:16.941
This is the thing from the pizza box
that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.

13:17.513 --> 13:20.949
Is that what that's for?
In India, the lid just touches the cheese.

13:21.116 --> 13:24.142
We also have rampant poverty
and periodic outbreaks of cholera...

13:24.320 --> 13:26.845
...so a little cardboard in our cheese
is no biggie.

13:29.024 --> 13:30.855
- Where you going?
- Comic-book store.

13:31.026 --> 13:33.586
Oh, an excellent idea.
I could certainly use a break.

13:33.762 --> 13:35.923
- Me too.
- You can go to the comic book store...

13:36.098 --> 13:38.362
...when man can once again
safely poop in space.

13:39.268 --> 13:40.701
Why does Leonard get to go?

13:40.870 --> 13:43.134
Because he's upset
over his situation with Penny.

13:43.305 --> 13:47.071
And if I have to hear about it again,
I'm gonna kick him in his ovaries.

13:47.643 --> 13:50.612
- Thanks for understanding, Howard.
HOWARD: I got your back, sister.

13:51.881 --> 13:56.147
All right, I think we've got a prototype
ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.317
- That's heavy.
- Damn right, it's heavy.

13:59.488 --> 14:00.785
It's my mother's meatloaf.

14:02.124 --> 14:05.252
It's been testing toilets for generations.

14:05.995 --> 14:07.019
I must say, Howard...

14:07.196 --> 14:10.688
...I think a detailed letter to MIT
describing your current circumstances...

14:10.866 --> 14:14.029
...might entitle you to a refund
on your Master's degree.

14:15.170 --> 14:20.130
Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste
disposal test with meatloaf analog.

14:21.510 --> 14:24.343
In three, two, one.

14:30.586 --> 14:32.918
Fascinating.

14:34.023 --> 14:36.014
What do you think the problem is?

14:36.191 --> 14:38.887
Not enough bread crumbs.

14:45.634 --> 14:48.364
- Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
- Sure, what's up?

14:48.537 --> 14:51.836
I think I gave you some bad advice
about Penny and I want to apologize.

14:52.007 --> 14:53.235
No, your advice was great.

14:53.409 --> 14:55.843
- It was?
- Oh, yeah, going slow really worked.

14:56.345 --> 14:57.937
You're kidding.

14:58.447 --> 15:00.506
Never worked for me.

15:00.683 --> 15:03.015
Yeah, last night at dinner
I did what you told me.

15:03.185 --> 15:05.949
I went really slow, I kept my distance...

15:06.121 --> 15:08.112
...and two bottles of wine later,
we were making out in my car.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.685
Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.

15:13.228 --> 15:15.628
It doesn't matter.
That's where it all went to hell.

15:15.798 --> 15:17.060
During the kissing?

15:17.232 --> 15:21.168
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.

15:22.404 --> 15:25.305
No, everything was good and really hot.

15:25.474 --> 15:28.443
And I said, oh, Penny...

15:28.611 --> 15:32.069
...and right where she was supposed
to say, "Oh, Stuart" she said...

15:33.382 --> 15:35.077
...your name.

15:39.888 --> 15:41.617
- Leonard?
- That is your name, right?

15:41.790 --> 15:44.156
Yeah. No, yeah, it is.

15:44.326 --> 15:45.918
Wow, I'm sorry.

15:46.095 --> 15:48.529
That must've been the last thing
you wanted to hear.

15:48.697 --> 15:52.997
Well, it beats,
"You know I'm a dude, right?"

15:55.170 --> 15:57.070
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.674
No doubt, no doubt.

16:02.411 --> 16:03.776
Okay, well...

16:03.946 --> 16:06.847
- ...l'm sorry it didn't work out.
- Not your fault.

16:07.282 --> 16:08.977
Yeah, how about that?

16:11.620 --> 16:14.418
- See you soon.
- Yep, sure.

16:28.704 --> 16:31.605
Yes, I understand. Classified.
We'll keep it all classified.

16:31.774 --> 16:34.242
No one has to know anything about this
but you and me.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.502
What's classified?

16:35.878 --> 16:38.779
Howard's space toilet. I'll tell you later.

16:39.982 --> 16:44.646
Well, they've deployed our solution.
Let's just all hope it works.

16:44.820 --> 16:46.617
I don't see why I have to worry.

16:46.789 --> 16:50.088
My career's not hanging in the balance.

16:55.798 --> 16:57.732
That was a joke.

16:57.900 --> 17:01.631
It's funny because it's true.

17:05.307 --> 17:07.741
Leonard,
could you pass the soy sauce, please?

17:07.910 --> 17:11.038
- I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
- Yeah, I said Leonard.

17:12.047 --> 17:14.208
Yes, you did, didn't you?

17:21.022 --> 17:22.512
What the hell is that?

17:23.224 --> 17:24.817
Meatloaf.

17:25.993 --> 17:27.655
What was it doing on the ceiling?

17:28.497 --> 17:30.397
That's classified.

17:36.405 --> 17:38.532
ASTRONAUT [O VER RADIO]:
<i>Houston, International Space Station.</i>

17:38.707 --> 17:41.403
<i>We have a little situation up here.</i>

17:41.944 --> 17:44.469
<i>We'd like to make an unscheduled</i>
<i>space walk.</i>

17:46.081 --> 17:47.207
MAN [O VER RADIO]:
<i>ISS, Houston...</i>

17:47.382 --> 17:49.850
<i>...which crew members</i>
<i>would be involved in this EVA?</i>

17:50.018 --> 17:54.011
ASTRONAUT: <i>Houston, we'd all like</i>
<i>to step outside for a few minutes.</i>

17:55.424 --> 17:59.087
MAN:
<i>ISS, I'm afraid we can't authorize that.</i>

17:59.261 --> 18:02.321
ASTRONAUT:
<i>Houston, this is more of an FYI call.</i>

18:02.498 --> 18:04.932
<i>We are basically out the door.</i>
