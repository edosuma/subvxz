<i>So, what's up with this need
for sudden male bonding?</i>

00:03.705 --> 00:06.174
I need to find a best man
for my wedding.

00:06.225 --> 00:06.841
"Deficit"!

00:06.892 --> 00:09.877
D-e-f-I-c-I-t.

00:12.815 --> 00:13.731
Okay, next one.

00:13.816 --> 00:14.732
You ready?

00:14.817 --> 00:16.351
"Fiduciary."

00:16.402 --> 00:18.520
Nate, there's something
that I've never told you.

00:18.587 --> 00:20.655
I used to be married...

00:20.723 --> 00:22.607
Before you and I met.

00:22.691 --> 00:24.392
Her name was Sara.

00:24.443 --> 00:26.394
And she died.

00:26.462 --> 00:28.029
Sara! Hey!

00:34.570 --> 00:38.089
I'm gonna get that Agent.

00:38.174 --> 00:40.959
As it turns out...

00:41.043 --> 00:43.411
I'm his type.

00:43.462 --> 00:44.412
What are you doing here?

00:44.463 --> 00:45.630
Honey, it's Sara.

00:45.698 --> 00:46.631
Don't say that.

00:46.715 --> 00:47.715
Clay...

00:47.766 --> 00:49.250
Sara's dead.

00:49.301 --> 00:50.768
And she's not
coming back.

00:50.853 --> 00:52.020
And neither are you.

00:52.087 --> 00:53.921
All right?
Do you understand me?

00:53.973 --> 00:54.973
Don't <i>ever
come back here.</i>

00:55.057 --> 00:56.274
Out.

00:56.358 --> 00:58.426
Why do you have a photo
with her?

00:58.477 --> 00:59.611
Because it's not her.

00:59.695 --> 01:00.995
It's Sara.

01:01.063 --> 01:02.313
You'll never be Sara.

01:02.398 --> 01:03.648
Neither will you.

01:03.732 --> 01:05.567
We'll see about that.

that I could go back to town

she'd take us.

Ooh, you did so awesome!

Okay, thank you, mom.

03:49.698 --> 03:51.149
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

Jamie wants to go home with
Ms. Lauren and his friends.

Oh. Well, uh...
I mean, I think the storm's

03:56.622 --> 03:58.656
really bad out
tonight, hon.

03:58.741 --> 03:59.991
So? Chuck and Madison
are going.

04:00.075 --> 04:01.993
Chuck's mom
is an alcoholic.

04:02.077 --> 04:05.046
Mom, come on.
I'm not a baby anymore. Please.

04:05.113 --> 04:06.130
I know you're not
a

04:06.215 --> 04:07.615
Okay,
I'll give you a choice.

04:07.666 --> 04:10.551
You can either ride home
with Chuck,

04:10.619 --> 04:12.754
who's probably standing behind
me right now making fun of you,

04:12.805 --> 04:16.423
or you can go with your mom
and dad who love you,

04:16.475 --> 04:19.594
and we'll stop by and see
aunt Quinn who's all alone.

04:19.644 --> 04:21.262
It's your choice.

04:21.313 --> 04:22.630
Thanks. See ya.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.601
Fine. Go,
you little dork.

04:26.652 --> 04:28.770
<i>You're</i> the dork.

04:28.821 --> 04:30.137
Ohh!

04:30.189 --> 04:32.156
Who took my baby and replaced
him with that monster?

04:32.241 --> 04:34.358
I told you we should've
sold him to Brooke

04:34.443 --> 04:37.028
before she lost
all her money.

04:37.112 --> 04:39.580
You do realize
we live <i>here,</i> yes?

04:39.648 --> 04:40.915
Yeah, I understand that.

04:40.982 --> 04:41.982
What I don't understand
is <i>why</i> we live here.

04:42.034 --> 04:43.618
Oh, I don't know.

04:43.669 --> 04:45.169
Maybe because
it's my <i>home?</i>

04:45.254 --> 04:46.954
Oh, well,
<i>my</i> home was in Los Angeles --

04:47.005 --> 04:48.790
a home I gave up
to be closer to you,

04:48.841 --> 04:50.258
because your work
was here.

04:50.325 --> 04:52.427
And was that
<i>so</i> horrible?

04:52.494 --> 04:55.830
No, but at least acknowledge
that it was a sacrifice,

04:55.881 --> 04:58.015
one that I was happy
to make for you.

04:58.100 --> 04:59.434
But your work
isn't here anymore.

04:59.501 --> 05:01.569
That's mean.

05:01.637 --> 05:02.687
I'm not saying it
to be mean.

05:02.771 --> 05:04.004
I'm saying it
because there's got to be

05:04.056 --> 05:05.139
so many more
opportunities

05:05.190 --> 05:06.808
for you in Los Angeles --
I don't --

05:06.859 --> 05:08.476
and there's definitely more
opportunities for <i>me</i> there.

05:08.527 --> 05:11.979
I suppose this was
your mother's idea?

05:12.030 --> 05:14.115
Come on, don't drag my mom
into this, please.

05:14.182 --> 05:15.850
Oh, how am I not
supposed to?

05:15.901 --> 05:19.036
She drags herself into every
other aspect of our lives.

05:19.121 --> 05:20.354
I said "please."

05:20.405 --> 05:23.357
You know, it all makes
perfect sense to me now.

05:23.408 --> 05:26.627
You <i>wanted</i> me to lose
the company.

05:26.695 --> 05:28.246
What's <i>that</i> supposed to mean?
It means...

05:28.330 --> 05:30.248
You encouraged me
to give it up,

05:30.332 --> 05:32.383
because it makes it
so much easier

05:32.468 --> 05:34.502
for you to move us
to Los Angeles!

05:34.553 --> 05:35.920
That's ridiculous. I --
is it?

05:37.473 --> 05:39.373
I tho--
Brooke, look at me.

05:41.727 --> 05:43.094
I thought you would be
happy there,

05:43.178 --> 05:44.562
but if you don't want
to move there, that's fine.

05:44.646 --> 05:46.097
We'll just...

05:46.181 --> 05:48.483
We might have to spend
more time apart.

05:48.550 --> 05:50.101
It's not that big
a deal.

05:50.185 --> 05:53.654
Brooke, where are you going?
There's a storm outside.

05:53.722 --> 05:56.908
It <i>is</i> a big deal!

05:56.992 --> 05:58.609
Brooke!

05:58.694 --> 06:00.778
Damn it!

06:02.447 --> 06:05.283
So you won't be back
till tomorrow.

06:05.367 --> 06:07.585
No, I-I'll be fine.

06:07.669 --> 06:09.787
Although I do
totally hate storms.

06:09.872 --> 06:11.455

I don't know.
I'm just driving.

10:01.709 --> 10:03.509
Brooke,
you need to come home.

10:03.594 --> 10:05.378
There's flooding
everywhere.

10:05.446 --> 10:07.463
They're saying that
the levee might break,

10:07.531 --> 10:09.532
and on top of all that...

10:09.600 --> 10:11.701
I'm sorry.

10:11.769 --> 10:13.186
And I love you.

10:13.253 --> 10:15.688
Please come home.

10:15.773 --> 10:18.024
I don't know if I can,
babe.

10:18.108 --> 10:20.193
I can barely see
the road.

10:20.277 --> 10:22.195
Okay, well, I'll come
and get you. Where are you?

10:22.279 --> 10:23.780
What? Ok-- I'll get you.
Where are --

10:23.847 --> 10:25.231
I can't hear you!

10:25.316 --> 10:27.116
I said, where are you?

10:27.184 --> 10:28.151
Just stay put,
and I'll come get you.

10:28.202 --> 10:30.186
I'm coming up
on the Gabel Bridge.

10:30.237 --> 10:32.238
I think if I can ju--

10:32.306 --> 10:34.073
Brooke?

10:34.158 --> 10:37.293
Brooke?! Brooke!

10:37.361 --> 10:39.495
Come on, come on,
come on.

10:41.799 --> 10:43.800
Oh, my God.

10:45.869 --> 10:47.720
Chuck?!

10:47.805 --> 10:50.539
Chuck, sweetie,
what happened?!

10:50.591 --> 10:51.424
Are you okay?!

10:51.508 --> 10:53.376
We had an accident.

10:53.427 --> 10:54.394
What?

10:58.715 --> 11:00.049
Oh, my God.

11:04.994 --> 11:06.861
Chuck?!

11:07.551 --> 11:08.456
Chuck, sweetie,
what happened?!

11:08.556 --> 11:09.389
Are you okay?!

11:09.441 --> 11:11.308
We had an accident.

11:11.392 --> 11:12.359
What?

11:17.449 --> 11:18.866
Oh, my God.

11:18.933 --> 11:20.433
Okay.

11:20.535 --> 11:23.237
I want you to go get in my car
and stay there. Okay?

11:24.656 --> 11:25.956
Help us! In here!

11:26.040 --> 11:27.774
I'm right here.

11:27.826 --> 11:28.942
Aunt Brooke!

11:28.993 --> 11:30.744
Jamie?!
Are you okay?!

11:30.795 --> 11:32.296
I think so.
I'm stuck.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.447
Ms. Lauren won't wake up.

11:34.499 --> 11:36.667
Uh, okay.
It's gonna be okay.

11:36.751 --> 11:38.335
You're Madison,
right, sweetie?

11:38.419 --> 11:39.553
Are you hurt?

11:39.620 --> 11:41.922
No. I don't think so.

11:41.973 --> 11:43.006
Okay.
Will you stand up for me?

11:43.091 --> 11:45.092
Okay. Okay, honey.

11:45.143 --> 11:46.626
Come to me.
I'm gonna help you out.

11:46.678 --> 11:49.129

11:56.271 --> 11:58.805
and sit in my car with Chuck,
okay? Good girl.

11:58.857 --> 12:01.108
And I want you to use my phone.
You try to call 911.

12:01.159 --> 12:02.776
Tell them
we're on the Gabel Bridge.

12:02.827 --> 12:04.311
Can you do that?
I can do it.

12:04.362 --> 12:05.913
I know you can.
Go on.

12:05.980 --> 12:08.448

Let me get under here.

12:27.468 --> 12:29.502
I can't get it, buddy.

12:30.972 --> 12:32.689
Is Ms. Lauren
gonna be okay?

12:35.610 --> 12:37.811
Yeah. We're all
gonna be okay, Jamie.

12:37.862 --> 12:39.062
I promise.

12:51.692 --> 12:53.877
No.
I got to say...

12:53.962 --> 12:56.213
I'm kind of down
on this rain thing right now.

12:56.297 --> 12:57.130
Yeah.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.218

13:02.754 --> 13:04.004
Hey, if I wasn't pregnant,

13:04.055 --> 13:06.039

It's Brooke.

It's Brooke.

14:26.620 --> 14:28.221
You had an accident.
Everything's okay.

14:28.289 --> 14:29.139
Don't move.

14:29.223 --> 14:30.290
Okay.
Okay?

14:30.341 --> 14:31.591
The kids!
No, no, no, no.

They're okay. They're okay.

14:32.894 --> 14:34.311

sweetheart.

14:34.395 --> 14:35.462
Jamie's right here.

14:35.513 --> 14:36.563
Chuck and Madison
are in my car.

14:36.630 --> 14:37.797
Everything is okay.

14:37.849 --> 14:39.632
It's okay.
I'm gonna go get some help.

14:39.684 --> 14:40.684
Okay?
Just stay here.

14:40.768 --> 14:41.768
Okay.

I'll be right back.

14:55.867 --> 14:57.918
Madison, sweetie,
hand me my purse.

14:57.985 --> 14:59.652
It's in the front seat.
Okay.

14:59.704 --> 15:00.921
The phone won't work,
and...

15:00.988 --> 15:02.806
I don't think
Chuck's doing so well.

15:02.874 --> 15:04.124
Chuck...

15:04.175 --> 15:07.044
Buddy, I need you to stay awake
for me, okay?

15:07.128 --> 15:08.295
Yeah.

15:08.346 --> 15:09.996
Okay.

15:11.332 --> 15:14.184
Madison,
keep trying the phone.

15:25.196 --> 15:27.030
Hey, honey, it's me.

15:27.115 --> 15:29.349
I'm surprised I got through.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.618
Anyway, I think
I'm gonna crash out early

15:31.685 --> 15:34.071
and try to stop my mind
from imagining things.

15:34.155 --> 15:35.855
So I just wanted to say
good night

15:35.907 --> 15:37.491
and that I can't wait
to see you.

15:37.542 --> 15:39.159

16:03.518 --> 16:05.435
How 'bout you, Lauren?

16:05.520 --> 16:06.770
I'm okay. I think the air bag
just knocked the wind out of me.

16:06.854 --> 16:07.854
How are the kids?

16:07.905 --> 16:09.239
Uh, I think Chuck
has a concussion,

16:09.323 --> 16:10.857
and you've got a really good
gash on your head.

16:10.908 --> 16:12.325
Don't worry about me.
Just take care of them.

16:12.393 --> 16:13.693
Is help on the way?

16:13.745 --> 16:15.662
The phones are down,
so for now it's just us.

16:15.729 --> 16:17.080
I really don't want
to move you,

16:17.165 --> 16:19.199
but all things considered,
I think that we should.

16:19.250 --> 16:20.867
Do you think you can
crawl out of here?

16:20.918 --> 16:23.086
Um, I-I don't know.
I could try.

16:23.171 --> 16:24.371
Okay.

16:24.422 --> 16:26.540
I'm gonna put this
over you.

16:26.591 --> 16:27.758
There might be
some glass.

16:46.594 --> 16:48.361
You okay?

16:48.429 --> 16:49.896
All right.

16:49.947 --> 16:51.198
Jamie, I'm gonna get
Ms. Lauren out,

16:51.265 --> 16:52.149
and then I'm coming back
for you, okay?

16:52.233 --> 16:53.600
I'll be here.

16:53.651 --> 16:55.902
Okay, honey,
just try to crawl to me.

16:55.987 --> 16:57.537
Just give me your hand.
Ohh.

16:57.605 --> 17:00.040
Brooke, it's Chuck!

17:00.107 --> 17:01.908
Go, go, go!

17:01.959 --> 17:03.743
Okay.

17:03.795 --> 17:05.078
What is it, sweetie?

17:05.128 --> 17:07.214
He won't stay awake.

17:07.281 --> 17:10.884
Okay. Okay, you go help
Ms. Lauren, okay?

17:10.951 --> 17:13.637
Chuck!

17:13.721 --> 17:17.124
Hey. Hey, buddy, I need you
to stay awake for me, okay?

17:17.191 --> 17:18.809
I can't.

17:18.893 --> 17:21.560
I don't want to.

17:21.628 --> 17:23.762
Okay.

17:23.815 --> 17:26.433
Hey, guys?
Chuck needs a doctor.

17:26.483 --> 17:28.134
I can take him.
Lauren, I don't know.

17:28.185 --> 17:29.519
Your head's really bad.

17:29.604 --> 17:31.521
No, no, I'm gonna be fine.
But what about Jamie?

17:31.606 --> 17:32.772
He's stuck
in there pretty good.

17:32.824 --> 17:34.324
It might take me some time
to get him out.

17:34.408 --> 17:35.408
Are you <i>sure
you can drive?</i>

17:35.476 --> 17:36.610
Yes, I am fine.
I promise.

17:36.661 --> 17:38.028
Okay.
You take the kids,

17:38.112 --> 17:39.496
and I'll stay here
with Jamie.

17:39.580 --> 17:40.831
Just send somebody back.

17:40.915 --> 17:42.699
All right. I will.
Okay.

17:42.783 --> 17:43.700
Hey, Brooke.
Huh?

17:45.152 --> 17:46.486
Be safe.

17:46.537 --> 17:49.039
You too.

17:55.012 --> 17:57.848
Hey.

18:00.384 --> 18:02.502
Okay.

18:04.188 --> 18:05.472
Are they leaving?!

18:05.523 --> 18:07.974
It's okay, buddy.
They're gonna go get help.

18:08.025 --> 18:11.844
Now, let's get you
out of there.

18:13.147 --> 18:14.564
All right.

18:31.817 --> 18:33.818
Can I help you?

18:33.869 --> 18:34.785
Yeah.

18:34.885 --> 18:36.135
You can help me
by getting back in the car,

18:36.235 --> 18:37.419
you pregnant goof.

18:37.503 --> 18:39.254
Please? I feel really bad.
This storm is terri--

18:39.338 --> 18:41.406

18:45.761 --> 18:48.263
This is <i>so
"Christmas story."</i>

18:48.347 --> 18:49.764
Back in the car,
Ralphie.

18:51.417 --> 18:53.652
Sorry.

18:58.591 --> 19:01.193
Okay.

19:22.732 --> 19:24.633
Rise and shine.

19:34.260 --> 19:37.145
Hide and seek.

19:37.230 --> 19:39.281
I <i>love</i> this game.

19:44.854 --> 19:46.605
No!!

19:49.025 --> 19:50.642
Aah!!

19:56.849 --> 19:59.000
Well, well. Déjà vu.

20:00.586 --> 20:02.671
Except for the part
with the knife in my leg!

20:04.540 --> 20:07.092
Then again...

20:07.159 --> 20:11.880
Bullets didn't work on you
the first time, did they?

20:15.017 --> 20:15.850
Okay.

20:27.179 --> 20:28.680
Knives it is.

20:33.852 --> 20:35.153
I love this game!

20:43.028 --> 20:44.546
Come on!

20:57.310 --> 20:58.727
Are you serious?

21:23.536 --> 21:26.037
I think this is
gonna work, buddy.

21:26.088 --> 21:27.706
Ow.

21:27.757 --> 21:30.425
Hey, whatcha got there?

21:30.509 --> 21:32.961
My ribbon
for the spelling bee.

21:33.045 --> 21:34.295
Second place.

21:34.380 --> 21:38.133
You got second place?
That's awesome!

21:38.217 --> 21:40.552
Madison got first.

21:40.603 --> 21:42.354
She spelled
"entrepreneur" correctly.

21:42.421 --> 21:44.088
Wow.

21:44.140 --> 21:47.275
Second place
is still <i>really</i> good.

21:49.762 --> 21:52.313
So, where were you
going anyway?

21:52.398 --> 21:54.098
What do you mean?

21:54.150 --> 21:55.817
When you found us.

21:57.737 --> 21:59.454
I was just driving.

21:59.538 --> 22:01.239
In a storm?

22:01.290 --> 22:04.275
Easy, 20 questions.

22:04.326 --> 22:07.078
Yes, I was driving
in a storm.

22:07.129 --> 22:08.263
Sorry.

22:08.330 --> 22:10.665
It's okay.

22:10.750 --> 22:14.836
I got in a fight with Julian
over something dumb.

22:14.920 --> 22:19.674
And I got mad because...

22:19.759 --> 22:23.261
Because I'm stubborn
and I'm stupid sometimes.

22:23.312 --> 22:24.562
You're not stupid.

22:24.630 --> 22:25.930
Mm...

22:25.981 --> 22:27.899
I was about <i>this.</i>

22:32.471 --> 22:34.305
Uh...

22:34.356 --> 22:36.024
How about you spell
some words for me?

22:36.108 --> 22:39.477
Like...How about...

22:39.528 --> 22:41.813
"Elusive"?

22:41.864 --> 22:43.998
"Elusive."

22:44.083 --> 22:46.668
E-l-

22:46.752 --> 22:49.871
you...Are...Something.

22:49.955 --> 22:53.708
You really think
I won't find you?

you were watching me...
