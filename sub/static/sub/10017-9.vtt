00:48.500 --> 00:50.830
Oh, God! Oh, no.

00:51.034 --> 00:52.261
Something wrong?

00:52.467 --> 00:54.433
All right, people.
Who ate my salad?

00:54.634 --> 00:56.897
Keep looking, Peter.
lt's there.

00:57.101 --> 00:59.966
-lt's not in here.
-The ignition's shot.

01:00.369 --> 01:03.200
No, l need someone to fix it today.

01:04.703 --> 01:06.193
Thank you.

01:07.904 --> 01:10.336
l think l'll shove my sister
in front of a train.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.164
She burn out your ignition switch?

01:12.372 --> 01:15.100
Yeah, l had to hot-wire it
to get to work.

01:15.307 --> 01:17.205
You know how to hot-wire a car?

01:17.440 --> 01:21.669
Learned it from one of her boyfriends.
He's in Joliet. Grand theft auto.

01:21.875 --> 01:23.239
Oh, God!

01:23.775 --> 01:25.605
We got a Rollerblader coming in.

01:25.776 --> 01:28.537
Bashed head again, five minutes off.

01:29.210 --> 01:32.371
This place is a mess.
Doesn't anybody ever clean it out?

01:34.311 --> 01:35.470
Jerry!

01:36.444 --> 01:38.536
Don't turf me a patient
without a chart.

01:38.745 --> 01:42.178
-l'm sorry, l thought--
-Don't apologize, do your damn job!

01:43.580 --> 01:45.137
lgnore him.

01:48.180 --> 01:51.875
More charts, great! Any more
exciting and l'll check myself in.

01:52.082 --> 01:55.515
Dr. Ross, Rescue 61 's bringing
a woman with severe head trauma.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.579
All the neurosurgeons are tied up.

01:57.783 --> 02:00.272
Divert the woman to St. Luke.

02:00.483 --> 02:03.314
So who died and
left you chief resident?

02:03.518 --> 02:05.643
Mark's got the flu.
l'm covering.

02:05.851 --> 02:09.340
Saint Mark is out?
lt must be pneumonia.

02:10.019 --> 02:12.281
-Hiya, Peter.
-Sarah.

02:12.486 --> 02:14.850
You two excited?
Announcement's today.

02:15.054 --> 02:17.987
-l can read a calendar, Haleh.
-What announcement?

02:18.188 --> 02:19.881
Starzl Fellowship.

02:20.088 --> 02:23.646
Maybe you noticed
Dr. Benton's a little anxious.

02:24.489 --> 02:27.251
They needed your DD-5
upstairs 20 minutes ago.

02:27.457 --> 02:31.480
l will send them four pints
of my blood. What is a DD-5?

02:31.691 --> 02:33.988
A status report.
You're were supposed to fill it out.

02:34.191 --> 02:37.955
-How did Mark do all of this?
-He puts in 4 hours after each shift.

02:38.159 --> 02:42.650
That's it. l will do anything to get
him here. l'll put him on a drip.

02:42.860 --> 02:46.224
l'll give him my next four paychecks.
l don't care how sick he is.

02:51.029 --> 02:52.325
Don't answer it.

02:55.630 --> 02:57.721
lt might be Craig.

02:58.431 --> 02:59.727
Who's Craig?

03:00.198 --> 03:02.061
Judge Franklin's other clerk.

03:03.332 --> 03:04.889
Call him back.

03:05.699 --> 03:08.132
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

03:08.566 --> 03:10.430
Hello?

03:10.634 --> 03:11.657
What the hell?

03:11.867 --> 03:15.061
-She called from the street?
-35th, over in Bridgeport.

03:15.568 --> 03:18.296
Are you certified or
do we need to call in a counselor?

03:18.502 --> 03:20.798
l'm certified. She say anything?

03:20.970 --> 03:23.528
Yeah. Not to touch her.

03:28.171 --> 03:29.432
Jamie?

03:30.705 --> 03:32.695
l'm Carol Hathaway, l'm a nurse.

03:32.906 --> 03:35.464
Can l take your coat?
lt's warm in here.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.238
There you go.

03:40.708 --> 03:42.731
Todd knows my boyfriend.

03:46.176 --> 03:48.699
He said Jack told him to pick me up.

03:53.110 --> 03:56.009
l shouldn't have gone with him.
l should've stayed home.

03:56.211 --> 03:58.177
But he was a friend of Jack's.

03:58.778 --> 04:00.937
l let it happen.
lt was my fault.

04:01.212 --> 04:04.111
lt's okay, you're safe here.
lt's gonna be okay.

04:08.580 --> 04:10.171
ls it?

04:59.892 --> 05:02.984
What are you talking about?
lt was very inappropriate.

05:03.194 --> 05:04.922
Please, l snapped at a clerk?

05:05.127 --> 05:08.788
-He's not a clerk, he's Jerry.
-Well, he didn't do his job.

05:08.995 --> 05:11.189
He didn't kill anyone, Div.
He lost a chart.

05:11.396 --> 05:13.521
l promise l'll never snap
at a clerk again.

05:13.896 --> 05:16.488
This morning, it was the cashier
at Starbucks.

05:17.464 --> 05:19.124
l don't know....

05:19.864 --> 05:21.626
What is wrong?

05:24.232 --> 05:28.824
What's wrong is that you're wasting
my time, and l'm late for rounds.

05:29.834 --> 05:31.766
Dr. Lewis. Call on two.

05:35.901 --> 05:37.458
Susan Lewis.

05:37.835 --> 05:41.928
You're not coming? You promised
you'd bring an ignition switch.

05:42.703 --> 05:44.192
Never mind.

05:45.870 --> 05:48.496
-l know who can fix your car.
-l'll worship you.

05:48.704 --> 05:51.398
Maybe you can just help me
get into an O.R.

05:51.672 --> 05:53.638
l think they're up on 3.

05:58.007 --> 06:01.838
-Dr. Benton always forgets me.
-Carter, important lesson in life.

06:02.041 --> 06:05.633
He who asks, gets.
He who doesn't, doesn't.

06:06.842 --> 06:09.206
-Coming through!
-Carter! Let's go.

06:09.409 --> 06:12.467
Kenny, Michael, 1 7. Passed out
in school. Vitals stable.

06:12.677 --> 06:14.075
Kid's a wrestler.

06:14.278 --> 06:16.938
l need a pill-pusher.
l don't think this is surgical.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.304
Got it.

06:20.145 --> 06:23.078
-Do we have a history on this kid?
-l don't know, call the school.

06:23.246 --> 06:27.475
All right, let's make him and
shake him. On my count: 1 , 2, 3.

06:29.381 --> 06:32.007
Do a dextrose stick.
Carter, get another line in.

06:32.215 --> 06:35.613
Let's get a CBC, lytes and
let's tox screen him for the works.

06:35.815 --> 06:38.373
Hypotensive.
70 over 60 and falling.

06:38.583 --> 06:40.015
Glucose normal.

06:40.783 --> 06:43.306
He's in trouble. Are those PVCs?
Rhythm strip.

06:46.118 --> 06:48.778
-Could be a normal rhythm with a block.
-Why?

06:49.019 --> 06:52.713
-lt's your call. What is this?
-l don't know.

06:52.919 --> 06:55.545
1 7-year-old with heart trouble.
Makes no sense.

06:58.354 --> 06:59.945
Extra beats.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.979
-He's going into arrhythmia.
-What do we do now?

07:08.423 --> 07:10.617
What exactly am l signing?

07:10.857 --> 07:14.416
Title to your car belongs to me now.

07:15.025 --> 07:18.049
We have a 300-pound diabetic.
She's in ketoacidosis.

07:18.259 --> 07:21.021
See if there's
an endocrinologist upstairs.

07:25.794 --> 07:29.193
You are late, Mookie James.

07:29.395 --> 07:32.487
-Guards wouldn't let me in.
-Get here earlier. J-O-B. Job.

07:32.696 --> 07:36.129
-That means be on time!
-Don't sweat me.

07:38.630 --> 07:41.028
How much money do these
doctors make, anyway?

07:41.264 --> 07:44.493
-Thirty thousand a year.
-That's all?

07:45.132 --> 07:49.293
Underpaid, overworked.
Get used to it.

07:50.366 --> 07:53.527
Pressure's still falling.
60 over 45.

07:54.501 --> 07:57.866
All right. Central line is in.

07:58.036 --> 08:00.434
Blood's back. No drugs,
but his lytes are screwed up.

08:00.636 --> 08:02.795
-What's his potassium?
-2.0.

08:03.003 --> 08:05.992
Piggyback 20 milliequivalents,
and keep an eye on the EKG.

08:06.203 --> 08:07.692
Why is his potassium crashing?

08:07.904 --> 08:10.632
lt could be hyperaldosteronism
or Barter's Syndrome.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.667
Put that damn book down!

08:13.439 --> 08:15.530
Or cirrhosis.

08:16.340 --> 08:17.999
Heart's racing. Looks like SVT.

08:20.007 --> 08:22.735
-Rate's climbing.
-We gotta stop this, it'll kill him.

08:22.941 --> 08:25.464
Rapid bolus adenosine, 6 mg.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.536
Nothing here. No constricting.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.970
lt's not coming down.
Let's shock him.

08:40.445 --> 08:42.707
-One hundred. Clear!
-Charged.

08:43.078 --> 08:45.568
-Pulse?
-Faint. l'm barely getting it.

08:45.780 --> 08:47.713
-Shock him again. 200.
-200.

08:47.913 --> 08:49.107
Clear.

08:51.181 --> 08:52.670
No pulse.
We're losing him.

08:52.882 --> 08:55.508
We have to get his rate down.
Send it up to 360.

08:56.516 --> 08:57.914
-Ready.
-Clear!

09:01.817 --> 09:04.545
-Give me a pacer. l'll overdrive him.
-You're going in blind?

09:04.751 --> 09:08.309
l'd wait for a fluoroscope but
l don't think he'd appreciate it.

09:08.719 --> 09:11.913
Carter, come close,
you won't see this every day.

09:20.622 --> 09:25.385
He has to float the catheter
into the heart very slowly.

09:31.158 --> 09:32.623
Pacer capture.

09:35.124 --> 09:36.421
Push it up to 300.

09:40.826 --> 09:44.657
All right. Now bring it
down slow, very slow.

09:45.227 --> 09:46.420
Slow.

09:46.861 --> 09:48.850
ls that smoothing out?

09:50.495 --> 09:52.427
Normal sinus rhythm.

10:00.464 --> 10:02.294
Call me when he wakes, huh?

10:07.666 --> 10:11.565
Last count, l filled out 306 forms
and it's not even noon.

10:11.734 --> 10:12.722
Finish it yet?

10:12.934 --> 10:15.366
What are these abbreviations?
What's TWD?

10:15.568 --> 10:17.693
Truly Weird Doctors.

10:18.069 --> 10:19.262
Thank you.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.264
How does Mark do this?
What is he, a machine?

10:28.871 --> 10:32.065
-Ready for another round?
-Just give me one minute.

10:32.272 --> 10:34.636
l knew you were a lightweight.

10:35.373 --> 10:38.067
lt's so great to see you so happy.

10:38.807 --> 10:41.330
l never felt like this before.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.632
l'm good at something.

10:43.974 --> 10:47.566
Franklin loved the rewrite
of my zoning opinion.

10:49.209 --> 10:53.869
They look at me differently now.
The other clerks and the secretaries.

10:54.077 --> 10:55.566
l like it.

11:01.079 --> 11:03.637
l didn't understand about you, Mark.

11:03.846 --> 11:06.142
How you love to go to work.

11:18.583 --> 11:20.776
Thank you for staying home today.

11:20.983 --> 11:23.541
l'm feeling a little guilty.

11:25.051 --> 11:27.074
You're entitled to a day off.

11:27.285 --> 11:30.275
You didn't take
a single sick day last year.

11:34.153 --> 11:37.086
-Let the machine get it.
-lt might be Craig.

11:37.287 --> 11:40.482
<i>We're not here.
Please leave a message at the tone.</i>

11:40.688 --> 11:44.280
<i>It's Doug. You're probably
in the bathroom throwing up.</i>

11:44.489 --> 11:47.422
-But l'm sinking here.
-They want that shift report.

11:47.622 --> 11:50.055
Tell them l'll get to it
when l can get to it!

11:50.757 --> 11:54.315
<i>If you've ever had
any feelings for me at all...</i>

11:54.524 --> 11:56.548
<i>...then haul your ass off that bed...</i>

11:56.759 --> 12:00.692
...and get down here and rescue me.
l am not kidding there, buddy.

12:00.892 --> 12:04.519
What is this? What is that?
l'm dying here, pal.

12:04.727 --> 12:09.423
So if you're awake and you could
call me, l'd appreciate it.

12:11.595 --> 12:13.721
Now l'm feeling really guilty.

12:15.329 --> 12:18.319
How many times did you cover
for Doug last year?

12:18.530 --> 12:21.019
Eight? Ten?

12:41.569 --> 12:44.092
Anybody ever do it to you?

12:44.570 --> 12:46.866
l've never been raped, no.

12:48.938 --> 12:51.961
My mother always said
l was asking for it.

12:52.905 --> 12:54.734
Jamie, look at me.

12:56.873 --> 12:59.271
You said no and that's enough.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.064
Nobody wants to be raped.

13:03.007 --> 13:04.439
We have to take samples...

13:05.274 --> 13:07.537
...swab for semen, pubic hairs.

13:08.042 --> 13:09.770
lt's called a rape kit.

13:10.043 --> 13:13.635
-Doctor gonna put his hands in me?
-No, l do it with another nurse.

13:13.844 --> 13:16.606
But the police will have
to take photographs.

13:18.845 --> 13:22.300
He's not bad, Todd.
Been nice to me.

13:22.779 --> 13:25.746
We have to do a rape kit now.

13:27.613 --> 13:29.909
What's Jack gonna say?

13:31.247 --> 13:32.975
Not gonna believe Todd did it.

13:33.315 --> 13:35.077
lt's not your fault, do you hear?

13:48.385 --> 13:52.080
Can you tell me when the results
of the Starzl will be announced?

13:52.953 --> 13:54.976
How are we supposed to find out?

13:55.186 --> 13:58.551
They'll be posted? Good.
Maybe you could just tell me if--

13:58.755 --> 14:01.153
Hello? Hello?

14:04.188 --> 14:05.381
Why are you so cheerful?

14:05.589 --> 14:09.148
l love watching you worry.
This is Mookie James.

14:09.356 --> 14:11.050
You remember Mookie?

14:11.257 --> 14:13.689
This is Dr. Benton.
He'll be your supervisor.

14:13.891 --> 14:17.756
That means if he says, ''Jump,''
you ask, ''How high?'' Got it?

14:18.226 --> 14:20.089
Yo, what's up?

14:20.760 --> 14:24.488
Follow me. Here, put these gloves on.
You're gonna need them.

14:25.827 --> 14:29.988
Take everything out. lf it's green,
it goes. lf it smells, it goes.

14:30.195 --> 14:32.457
Check expiration dates.
Look for mold.

14:32.662 --> 14:35.094
Look for anything that
can crawl out of here.

14:35.296 --> 14:37.455
l want you to scrub it
from top to bottom.

14:37.663 --> 14:40.630
l wanna be able to eat
Sunday dinner off this thing.

14:41.030 --> 14:43.428
-What?
-l'm a janitor?

14:43.798 --> 14:46.526
What did you think you'd be doing?
Brain surgery?

14:46.732 --> 14:49.096
Cop in Trauma 2.
Gunshot, superficial.

14:49.299 --> 14:52.266
All right. Come on.
Let's go. Don't take all day.

15:05.303 --> 15:06.735
How you doing? You okay?

15:06.937 --> 15:09.869
-You got what you need?
-l got plenty of pictures.

15:10.805 --> 15:12.771
This'll just take a minute.

15:13.671 --> 15:16.036
Just relax. There you go.

15:28.041 --> 15:29.507
So you got a boyfriend?

15:35.677 --> 15:37.438
What is he, like a doctor?

15:37.911 --> 15:39.537
Yes, he is.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.235
lt must be great.

15:42.912 --> 15:44.776
They make lots of money.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.002
That's it.

15:55.548 --> 15:57.640
Why am l doing this?

15:59.616 --> 16:02.606
l want my name in the paper,
l'll go kill myself.

16:04.518 --> 16:06.177
You listen to me.

16:08.018 --> 16:10.780
You'll get through this.
You'll move past it.

16:12.319 --> 16:13.478
Yeah.

16:15.253 --> 16:16.379
Sure.

16:20.188 --> 16:24.144
So l put in a new ignition switch
and some leads there for you.

16:24.488 --> 16:27.580
By the way, why ain't
the lady doctor paying?

16:27.856 --> 16:30.584
l'm gonna get that from her later.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.886
1 98.50, doc.

16:33.258 --> 16:35.281
That kind of dough,
l hope she's pretty.

16:35.491 --> 16:37.014
She's just a friend.

16:41.293 --> 16:43.657
-lt's Craig.
-Don't get it. lt could be Doug.

16:45.393 --> 16:47.155
<i>-Hello?
-Mark?</i>

16:48.628 --> 16:49.787
Sorry.

16:52.061 --> 16:54.028
-Hi, Doug.
-How are you?

16:55.296 --> 16:58.127
l'm a little better.
My fever is down.

16:58.364 --> 16:59.352
What are you doing?

16:59.963 --> 17:02.589
l'm just raiding the refrigerator.

17:02.798 --> 17:06.232
You're eating. You must be better.
Sure you don't wanna come in?

17:07.232 --> 17:08.858
l don't think so.

17:09.132 --> 17:10.689
l thought Jen was in Milwaukee.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.523
Actually, the judge she works for,
he had to fly to Washington...

17:15.733 --> 17:18.496
...and so she had the day off.

17:18.701 --> 17:20.258
<i>Just one day, huh?</i>

17:20.736 --> 17:22.634
lt's been two weeks
since you saw her?

17:23.236 --> 17:25.634
<i>-Three.
-Three, that's right.</i>

17:26.170 --> 17:30.501
l'll let you get back to being sick.
We wouldn't want you to....

17:30.838 --> 17:33.134
Wouldn't want it
to turn into pneumonia.

17:34.705 --> 17:36.069
Thanks, Doug.

17:45.241 --> 17:46.366
What?

17:46.742 --> 17:51.004
Mark is very sick at home
with his wife.

18:01.112 --> 18:03.305
l'm John Carter.
What are you doing?

18:04.013 --> 18:06.605
l was feeling better.
l needed some exercise.

18:06.813 --> 18:11.372
Exercise isn't a good idea. You had
a major coronary event this morning.

18:11.581 --> 18:12.842
You a doctor?

18:13.281 --> 18:16.737
No, l'm a med student.
Dr. Lewis tells me you're a wrestler.

18:16.949 --> 18:20.609
l used to wrestle.
Junior varsity. College at Penn.

18:20.817 --> 18:23.283
They got a great coach.
l read about him.

18:24.784 --> 18:26.750
Making your weight class okay?

18:27.318 --> 18:29.284
Sure. Easy.

18:29.819 --> 18:33.377
l didn't eat sometimes to make mine.
Boy, l was tired a lot.

18:33.586 --> 18:36.212
-Me too.
-So you're not eating?

18:36.420 --> 18:38.147
No. l eat plenty.

18:38.353 --> 18:41.787
That's weird. Your blood tests
look like you're not eating.

18:44.855 --> 18:46.481
l was there this morning.

18:46.689 --> 18:48.280
And you almost died.

18:51.191 --> 18:54.123
l'm okay. l'm in good shape.

18:55.224 --> 18:58.555
How much did you lose?
Eight, ten pounds?

18:58.759 --> 19:01.919
You must be cycling up and down
between every match.

19:03.092 --> 19:07.185
l have a match against Western
next week. Team's counting on me.

19:08.928 --> 19:11.292
You should tell
Dr. Lewis the truth...

19:11.495 --> 19:13.723
...so she can admit you
to the hospital.

19:14.995 --> 19:16.155
Please.

19:18.730 --> 19:20.855
l have to be on the team.

19:21.398 --> 19:23.057
You've got a problem.

19:23.832 --> 19:27.026
lt's a kind of anorexia.

19:27.466 --> 19:31.297
And if you keep starving yourself,
it is going to kill you.

19:36.034 --> 19:37.092
He's been coughing?

19:37.301 --> 19:40.291
No, he just won't eat.
Usually, he eats like a horse.

19:40.502 --> 19:42.661
He never stops.
He's not picky.

19:42.869 --> 19:44.392
lt's gonna be fine.

19:44.603 --> 19:46.364
Temp's 1 00.2.

19:46.636 --> 19:49.626
All right, Ben,
take a deep breath for me, okay?

19:52.305 --> 19:53.669
One more time.

19:59.873 --> 20:02.203
He has a sore throat.
That's why he's not eating.

20:02.407 --> 20:04.135
ls it croup?
He had it as a baby.

20:04.707 --> 20:09.004
He's a little old for that. Let me get
x-rays to make sure it's not serious.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.300
lt hurts. l can't eat.

20:11.509 --> 20:13.533
l know. We'll fix you right up, okay?

20:14.443 --> 20:16.501
All right. l'll be right back.

20:25.146 --> 20:28.011
Have an intubation tray ready
in case he gets worse.

20:28.247 --> 20:30.713
An irate internist is
looking for your scalp...

20:30.914 --> 20:33.346
...for assigning his patient
to the resident on call.

20:33.548 --> 20:37.913
Perfect. Just what l need.
You take Ben to Radiology...

20:38.115 --> 20:41.513
...and you stay with him.
Let me know if anything changes.

20:42.083 --> 20:44.845
l've been hearing your son
is on his way, Mrs. Benton.

20:45.051 --> 20:46.415
On his way?

20:46.618 --> 20:47.709
Where?

20:48.151 --> 20:50.448
He's coming to see you.

20:50.651 --> 20:53.675
lt's the stroke.
Some days, she's a little out of it.

20:54.752 --> 20:56.912
Hey, Walt, what's up?
Hey, Ma.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.551
How you doing?

20:58.887 --> 21:00.217
But my foot hurts.

21:00.421 --> 21:02.614
Yeah, l know.
You sprained your ankle.

21:02.821 --> 21:05.879
She's in pain. You should've
taken her to Mercy, it's closer.

21:06.089 --> 21:08.555
l thought you'd wanna
take care of your mother.

21:11.057 --> 21:13.114
When did you grow that mustache?

21:14.557 --> 21:16.217
Three years ago, Ma.

21:21.025 --> 21:24.788
-Don't you have to be somewhere?
-No, actually, it's kind of slow.

21:25.193 --> 21:26.454
Carter.

21:27.027 --> 21:29.220
You got people in Tennessee?

21:29.428 --> 21:31.156
On my father's side.

21:32.496 --> 21:34.724
l think his people owned our people.

21:38.230 --> 21:42.061
But you're a nice boy.
You come to Thanksgiving dinner.

21:43.331 --> 21:44.558
She doesn't mean that.

21:44.764 --> 21:47.663
No. You come to dinner now,
you promise.

21:50.066 --> 21:51.692
l promise.

21:52.433 --> 21:53.831
Let's go take care of you.

21:54.033 --> 21:57.693
Morgenstern wants you in the O.R.
A mesocaval shunt.

21:59.235 --> 22:03.100
Okay, Ma, l'll see you later, okay?

22:03.302 --> 22:05.292
Dr. Carter will take care of you.

22:06.370 --> 22:09.064
Walter, don't even start.
l gotta go.

22:13.371 --> 22:15.395
Excuse me for a second.
l'll be back.

22:23.140 --> 22:26.107
-Where are you going?
-l thought you'd let me go with you.

22:26.308 --> 22:30.570
Mesocaval shunt. l ought to learn
and maybe l could help.

22:30.942 --> 22:34.966
-l asked you to look after my mother.
-You said yourself it's only a sprain.

22:35.177 --> 22:39.133
Still, l want you to clean
those lacs in 2 and stitch them up.

22:39.611 --> 22:44.238
See if my mother needs anything
to eat. She doesn't eat enough.

22:46.646 --> 22:47.976
Go. Let's move.

22:57.549 --> 23:02.107
Headline news. Guess who's leaving us?
Starzl Fellowship winner.

23:02.316 --> 23:05.181
-Good guys win?
-Cancel the champagne.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.850
Excuse me.

23:08.618 --> 23:10.881
What is this,
a funeral or something?

23:17.020 --> 23:21.010
Dr. Langworthy is a year ahead of me.
l didn't expect to win.

23:28.756 --> 23:31.018
-Here, Jerry.
-Thanks.

23:31.257 --> 23:32.985
When can you come back?

23:33.191 --> 23:37.248
Not before Thanksgiving.
Can you come up next weekend?

23:37.458 --> 23:40.823
No, l work both days.
l've got Wednesday.

23:41.026 --> 23:45.050
We do oral arguments on Thursday
and letter briefing Wednesday nights.

23:45.260 --> 23:47.318
That's where you always are.

23:47.561 --> 23:51.187
lt's almost seven years.
They say you get an itch.

23:52.662 --> 23:54.151
All the time.

23:55.962 --> 23:58.520
l don't think about anybody else.

23:58.796 --> 24:01.820
-Susan Lewis?
-We're just friends.

24:03.697 --> 24:05.664
What is this? You projecting?

24:13.600 --> 24:15.589
Where else can we do it?

24:16.201 --> 24:19.656
l wanna have memories to hold me
over the next few weeks.

24:19.868 --> 24:21.425
Kitchen table?

24:22.669 --> 24:24.363
lt's your grandmother's.

24:24.569 --> 24:26.297
Worked for Grandpa.

24:27.703 --> 24:29.726
Let the machine get it.

24:36.639 --> 24:38.765
Let me out!
Get your hands off me!

24:38.972 --> 24:42.303
l can't stitch him
if he won't settle down.

24:42.741 --> 24:45.730
-Mr. Randall.
-l'm a citizen of a free country!

24:45.941 --> 24:49.931
-You got no right to keep me here!
-Your head is bleeding.

24:50.142 --> 24:51.904
Let me go!

24:53.609 --> 24:55.473
lt ain't worth it.

24:55.677 --> 24:58.541
-Nothing's worth it.
-Mr. Randall? Mr. Randall?

24:58.710 --> 25:00.506
Take him to Exam 2.

25:00.878 --> 25:02.071
Let's go.

25:02.279 --> 25:06.769
Get Cvetic down here. He might need
assessment for suicidal depression.

25:23.616 --> 25:26.481
How long you gonna pretend
l'm not here?

25:26.918 --> 25:30.248
That's fairly self-centered of you.
l'm working.

25:32.818 --> 25:36.274
Congratulations on the Starzl.

25:36.487 --> 25:39.578
l'm sorry you didn't get it,
but l'm glad l did.

25:39.787 --> 25:42.253
Would you rather someone else had won?

25:42.721 --> 25:45.085
l really wasn't that invested in it.

25:46.389 --> 25:49.584
You wanted me to lose
if you couldn't win.

25:51.890 --> 25:53.322
l'm a year ahead of you.

25:53.591 --> 25:56.955
l could help you be a better
surgeon if you'd let me.

25:58.759 --> 26:00.452
You know what your problem is?

26:00.659 --> 26:04.888
No, but l have a feeling
you're willing to tell me.

26:05.127 --> 26:06.922
Losing to a woman.

26:07.127 --> 26:08.457
Oh, come on.

26:09.594 --> 26:13.028
The truth is,
you wanna sleep with me.

26:13.495 --> 26:15.860
Then you wouldn't be so threatened.

26:24.498 --> 26:27.090
Not only don't l want
to sleep with you...

26:27.332 --> 26:29.890
...l've never even fantasized about it.

26:32.366 --> 26:33.696
Obviously, you have.

26:41.035 --> 26:42.433
Yeah, right.

26:43.468 --> 26:44.991
Excuse me.

26:48.404 --> 26:51.393
l just wanna leave, okay?

26:54.038 --> 26:57.994
Why don't you want a doctor
to take care of your head?

26:58.573 --> 27:00.233
What are you, a shrink?

27:00.440 --> 27:04.305
Shrinks, they tell me l'll get over it.

27:04.507 --> 27:08.305
My wife gets smashed
against a streetlight...

27:08.508 --> 27:13.272
...and my son gets his head cut off,
and l'll get over it real soon.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.036
You know...

27:19.210 --> 27:21.768
...there's nothing wrong
with being angry.

27:22.512 --> 27:24.910
l don't need this patronizing crap.

27:26.046 --> 27:27.706
You think you're important?

27:28.846 --> 27:34.371
No one denies your pain, Mr. Randall.
But self-pity isn't the answer.

27:38.182 --> 27:40.774
Hold it now! Cool it!

27:40.983 --> 27:43.881
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Now come on!

27:44.517 --> 27:48.143
l'm ordering Mr. Randall
committed for 72 hours.

27:48.384 --> 27:50.248
Take him to 5,
put him in restraints.

27:50.451 --> 27:51.678
You're locking me up?

27:52.385 --> 27:55.681
You dumb bastard!
Who do you think you are?!

27:55.886 --> 27:57.876
You can't do this to me!

27:58.253 --> 28:01.778
-l can drink all day long!
-Just stand still!

28:02.721 --> 28:06.677
-What's that about?
-Oh, l committed him.

28:07.156 --> 28:09.554
What? He's a drunk.

28:09.756 --> 28:11.551
He's dangerous.
He tried to hit me.

28:12.090 --> 28:14.318
Did you do a full psych exam?

28:14.524 --> 28:16.491
He's a pathetic drunk,
l didn't have to.

28:16.824 --> 28:18.188
What's wrong with you?

28:18.391 --> 28:20.949
Are you trying to ruin your career?
What if he sues?

28:21.159 --> 28:22.523
Screw him!

28:22.726 --> 28:24.453
What if he does?

28:27.760 --> 28:30.386
Are you busy later?
You wanna do some ltalian?

28:34.629 --> 28:38.858
-Carol, you got a minute?
-Yeah. Excuse me.

28:40.563 --> 28:42.893
The police lab called
about the rape kit.

28:43.097 --> 28:46.690
They said there are four different
pubic hairs in the samples.

28:46.898 --> 28:48.956
Hers and three others.

28:49.732 --> 28:51.596
-Will you cover for me?
-Sure.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.330
Jamie, who else was there last night?

28:58.567 --> 29:02.557
There were three other types of
human hair in the samples we took.

29:03.035 --> 29:05.092
The police will ask
the same questions.

29:05.302 --> 29:08.064
So if you want me to help,
you have to help me.

29:08.270 --> 29:11.668
-l was with Todd like l told you.
-And who else?

29:11.937 --> 29:13.631
l don't remember.

29:13.938 --> 29:16.995
-Have you told me anything that's true?
-Yes!

29:18.073 --> 29:21.130
l went over to Todd's,
and he had two friends there.

29:21.340 --> 29:24.795
And l didn't know them,
and we were drinking.

29:25.007 --> 29:27.565
-And then what happened?
-l don't remember.

29:28.008 --> 29:31.203
-Anything?
-No. No!

29:31.875 --> 29:36.104
Christ, no! l don't remember.
l was drunk.

29:36.310 --> 29:39.868
There were these guys,
and l was pushing Todd away...

29:40.078 --> 29:43.533
...and this other guy--
Oh, God! Oh, God!

29:45.512 --> 29:47.239
Okay. All right.

29:47.479 --> 29:48.502
lt's okay.

29:55.247 --> 29:56.270
lt's okay.

29:56.448 --> 29:59.540
l am the acting
chief resident of this ER.

29:59.749 --> 30:04.580
Why don't you go back to the 6th floor?
Aren't you late for a golf game?

30:04.984 --> 30:07.746
-What?
-The McCabe kid stopped breathing.

30:09.151 --> 30:13.481
Call Anesthesiology and get an
ENT surgeon down here now, please.

30:13.685 --> 30:15.777
-He's hypoxic.
-Epiglottitis.

30:15.986 --> 30:19.078
Coming through!
50-year-old crasher. Collapsed lung.

30:23.588 --> 30:27.351
-Oxygen sat's 70 and dropping.
-All right, laryngoscope.

30:27.522 --> 30:29.579
-How long has he been out?
-Less than a minute.

30:29.789 --> 30:31.721
This came on fast.
Where's the mother?

30:31.923 --> 30:32.912
Waiting room.

30:34.091 --> 30:37.251
l can't see his cords.
See if we can get an air bubble.

30:39.791 --> 30:42.519
-What's the time?
-Lot of swelling. Suction.

30:46.793 --> 30:49.259
This tube is too big.
l need a smaller one.

30:53.695 --> 30:55.923
Diminished breath sounds on the right.

30:56.695 --> 30:58.218
Hyperresonant.

31:00.397 --> 31:03.557
Okay. We got a tracheal shift.

31:03.864 --> 31:06.057
Oh, no, tension pneumo.

31:06.999 --> 31:10.591
-Doug needs a smaller ET tube.
-Bottom drawer.

31:12.766 --> 31:14.255
What's Doug got in there?

31:14.467 --> 31:17.298
-Epiglottitis, 6-year-old..
-BP's 70 over 50. He's cyanotic.

31:17.501 --> 31:19.626
Give me a 1 4-gauge needle.

31:29.703 --> 31:33.363
Got it. Congratulations,
Mr. Kalman, you're gonna live.

31:33.571 --> 31:35.367
lt's swollen shut.

31:38.572 --> 31:40.971
Do me a favor, take this a moment.

31:43.474 --> 31:45.065
How long's he been out?

31:46.008 --> 31:47.406
Coming up on two minutes.

31:47.608 --> 31:49.870
-What about a needle crike?
-Not yet.

31:59.011 --> 32:00.341
What're you doing?

32:00.544 --> 32:02.271
-l'm going in.
-l said, not yet.

32:14.147 --> 32:18.444
Haleh, hook up a 3.0 ET tube hub
to a cath and bag him.

32:22.282 --> 32:24.078
Hyperventilate him now!

32:38.220 --> 32:40.709
O-2 sat's up to 95.

32:43.187 --> 32:47.780
Start him on 750 mg
ceftriaxone lV cue 1 2.

32:49.889 --> 32:51.583
Son of a bitch!

33:04.459 --> 33:08.620
You lose a fellowship,
so you have to prove something.

33:08.827 --> 33:11.884
-You couldn't get a tube in.
-l had time to crike him!

33:12.094 --> 33:16.323
-90 more seconds and he'd be dead.
-90 seconds and it's my choice.

33:16.529 --> 33:18.120
-He's alive.
-He's my patient!

33:18.329 --> 33:20.262
So it's okay if he dies, right?

33:20.463 --> 33:23.520
So you're the only person
that can keep him alive?

33:48.469 --> 33:50.561
lt was a judgment call.

33:53.471 --> 33:55.334
One l should've let you make.

34:00.773 --> 34:03.763
You lost a fellowship today,
not a patient.

34:09.908 --> 34:11.931
You know what l looked like?

34:14.208 --> 34:15.835
ln that interview?

34:17.810 --> 34:21.005
l made a fool out of myself
in front of Morgenstern.

34:21.944 --> 34:25.809
You saved two lives in five minutes.
lt's not a bad day.

34:38.447 --> 34:41.472
Don't give her a hard time.
Just take her statement.

34:43.483 --> 34:44.947
Jamie?

34:50.618 --> 34:51.947
What's going on?

34:53.185 --> 34:55.743
-Have you seen Jamie Hendricks?
-Who?

34:55.952 --> 34:58.942
-The girl who was raped.
-l think she just left.

35:18.391 --> 35:21.949
My mom's dropping Rachel off
in about 20 minutes.

35:23.959 --> 35:25.891
We should get dressed.

35:26.360 --> 35:30.225
Are we pretending? l think
your mom knows that we have sex.

35:30.428 --> 35:32.792
She doesn't like to be reminded.

35:34.828 --> 35:36.590
Let the machine get it.

35:36.796 --> 35:40.160
<i>Hi, we're not here.
Please leave a message at the tone.</i>

35:40.530 --> 35:45.021
<i>Hi, Jennifer, it's Craig.
The judge read your new opinion--</i>

35:45.230 --> 35:46.787
Hi, l'm here.

35:47.532 --> 35:50.464
He liked it? That's great.

35:51.765 --> 35:53.493
Why don't you call him back?

35:54.466 --> 35:56.126
Let me get it out.

35:58.534 --> 36:00.865
<i>Okay, Morrison v. Kentucky.</i>

36:01.068 --> 36:04.365
lf you look at the forum
selection clause arguments...

36:04.835 --> 36:07.961
...l think that you'll see
the jurisdictional issues apply.

36:08.969 --> 36:11.129
l know the Supreme Court settled it.

36:11.337 --> 36:14.667
But the arguments are very similar
to the ones we're using.

36:17.072 --> 36:19.265
Well, use some imagination.

36:21.573 --> 36:22.903
Yes.

36:24.441 --> 36:26.304
Go to page three.

36:37.043 --> 36:38.634
Dr. Ross.

36:38.811 --> 36:41.834
This is our new ER aide, Bogdonna--

36:42.044 --> 36:43.533
No, Bobdonna--

36:43.745 --> 36:47.371
-What is it?
-No. Bogdanalivetsky.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.670
How about ''Bob''?

36:50.680 --> 36:51.668
Bob?

36:51.847 --> 36:55.302
l see you're answering
to your new name already.

36:57.648 --> 36:59.205
See? That's cool.

37:00.649 --> 37:01.637
Cool.

37:06.616 --> 37:09.583
l'm taking Mr. Randall downstairs.
His meds are back.

37:09.784 --> 37:11.546
You gotta sign him out.

37:12.919 --> 37:14.976
Dr. Cvetic know about this?

37:15.186 --> 37:16.550
Thank you.

37:32.789 --> 37:34.278
What's going on?

37:34.490 --> 37:36.423
You seem much better.

37:38.925 --> 37:40.982
lt happens when you sober up.

37:41.425 --> 37:43.618
That was a nasty gash.

37:45.426 --> 37:47.517
l walked into a door.

37:53.061 --> 37:54.993
What are we doing in here?

37:55.328 --> 37:58.090
Going for an elevator ride.

37:59.463 --> 38:01.827
A doctor with a sense of humor.

38:03.497 --> 38:05.327
That's a treat.

38:10.299 --> 38:11.788
Go home, Mr. Randall.

38:13.133 --> 38:15.292
l thought l was in for 72 hours.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.660
You seem much calmer.
Call a cab, go home.

38:19.501 --> 38:20.865
Thank you.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.066
Hey, Walt.

38:44.307 --> 38:46.001
You got car trouble?

38:46.273 --> 38:47.796
No, l....

38:48.007 --> 38:49.030
No.

38:50.374 --> 38:52.000
Pass me a wrench, will you?

38:52.209 --> 38:53.766
Five-eighths.

38:54.709 --> 38:59.143
Would your dad be surprised if he
could see me now running his business?

38:59.343 --> 39:01.173
And you a surgeon?

39:04.278 --> 39:06.972
You hear about
that fellowship thing today?

39:09.279 --> 39:12.677
lf you got it, l'd hate
to see your face if you didn't.

39:13.247 --> 39:14.577
l didn't get it.

39:15.013 --> 39:16.639
No kidding.

39:19.715 --> 39:22.238
You know, Walt, it's hard to lose.

39:23.382 --> 39:25.372
Most of us are used to it.

39:26.751 --> 39:30.013
Your trouble is, you got
most of what you want.

39:30.485 --> 39:33.645
And when you don't get
what you want, it hurts more.

39:34.952 --> 39:36.248
So is that wrong?

39:37.452 --> 39:39.009
Just a little selfish.

39:40.987 --> 39:43.180
You got a hard shell, Pete.

39:43.654 --> 39:45.415
You don't let anyone in.

39:46.588 --> 39:47.849
Just like your dad.

39:54.389 --> 39:56.549
l wouldn't worry about it, though.

39:58.758 --> 40:00.748
You're basically a good guy.

40:04.826 --> 40:06.621
Give me a hand with this.

40:43.635 --> 40:44.896
Jamie?

40:45.069 --> 40:47.001
Go away.

40:48.503 --> 40:50.969
What happened?
What are you doing here?

40:51.170 --> 40:53.160
What do you care?

40:55.838 --> 40:57.963
l don't know where to go.

41:00.139 --> 41:03.038
My boyfriend doesn't want me
to come home.

41:04.940 --> 41:06.372
He doesn't believe me.

41:11.275 --> 41:13.764
Maybe l could have fought harder.

41:15.209 --> 41:18.334
l let them do it.
How could l let them do it?

41:22.544 --> 41:24.841
Nobody will believe me.

41:25.678 --> 41:27.372
You said no, didn't you?

41:30.679 --> 41:31.906
l did.

41:32.746 --> 41:34.872
Then you have to finish this.

41:36.114 --> 41:39.047
You gotta take care of things.
lf you don't...

41:39.648 --> 41:41.547
...they come back.

41:42.282 --> 41:43.976
They always do.

41:48.184 --> 41:49.809
l don't know.

41:51.417 --> 41:52.644
l know.

41:58.086 --> 41:59.211
Come here.

42:00.920 --> 42:03.386
Come on. Come on.
