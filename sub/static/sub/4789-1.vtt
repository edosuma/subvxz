WEBVTT

00:27.237 --> 00:30.115
Can I do this? What do I do?
Shall I do this?

00:31.783 --> 00:33.326
- Okay.
- There.

00:39.708 --> 00:43.503
I don't have a plate yet.
I've had four in front of me.

00:44.295 --> 00:45.797
How do you like, white or dry?

00:45.880 --> 00:47.590
This one doesn't have any meat.

00:47.966 --> 00:50.135
- Here it is.
- I like white and dark.

00:52.929 --> 00:55.140
Well, give this to whoever's done.

01:05.108 --> 01:07.902
We've got two tons of potatoes.

01:11.823 --> 01:13.825
Tom. Tom.

01:14.451 --> 01:15.827
I'll drink to that.

01:32.385 --> 01:34.721
Did you know the subject,
Thomas Gruneman?

01:34.804 --> 01:35.972
Yes.

01:36.055 --> 01:37.265
Very well?

01:38.057 --> 01:39.601
He was my best friend.

01:40.894 --> 01:42.437
We grew up together.

01:42.937 --> 01:46.483
Can you account
for his disappearance in any way?

01:47.525 --> 01:49.027
- Mrs. Gruneman?
- No.

01:50.445 --> 01:55.658
Did he recently appear to be agitated
or depressed in any way?

01:55.742 --> 01:56.743
No.

01:58.703 --> 02:01.289
Now, Mr. Cable, at the plant,

02:01.372 --> 02:06.002
did he voice any grievance
or discontent about his work there?

02:06.795 --> 02:10.715
No, not at all. Tom operated best
when he was under pressure.

02:10.799 --> 02:13.384
Please forgive me, Mrs. Gruneman,
but I have to ask.

02:13.468 --> 02:16.262
Did your husband ever show...

02:17.847 --> 02:20.892
any moral or sexual problems
or peculiarities?

02:20.975 --> 02:22.393
No. No.

02:22.477 --> 02:25.188
Any marital problems in general, that is?

02:25.730 --> 02:27.148
We were very happy.

02:27.232 --> 02:32.362
Did he ever mention, specifically,
a girl or a woman in New York City?

02:32.904 --> 02:33.947
No.

02:35.073 --> 02:37.116
- No.
- Why?

02:37.200 --> 02:42.247
We recovered in his desk at the plant,
in one of the drawers,

02:42.330 --> 02:45.041
a letter, a typewritten letter,

02:45.124 --> 02:48.419
that was evidently written
on the Friday before he disappeared.

02:49.879 --> 02:53.925
It was written to a girl in New York City,

02:54.008 --> 02:56.219
and we contacted the police.

02:56.302 --> 02:58.304
They brought her in, questioned her,

02:58.388 --> 03:02.016
and she said that she had received
six or seven letters of this kind.

03:02.100 --> 03:03.184
Can I see it?

03:04.269 --> 03:08.398
Well, it's an obscene letter,
Mrs. Gruneman.

03:09.732 --> 03:11.276
I would like to see it.

03:17.740 --> 03:21.744
I'd like you to remember that it
was written by a very disturbed man.

03:23.496 --> 03:25.039
I don't believe it.

03:34.215 --> 03:38.845
I'd like you to know that situations of
this kind are not unique, Mrs. Gruneman.

03:38.928 --> 03:42.223
A man will lead... a double life,

03:42.307 --> 03:46.019
a Jekyll-and-Hyde existence,
and his wife has no idea what's going on.

04:14.380 --> 04:18.760
<i>Has anybody talked to you about
the financial arrangements?</i>

04:19.552 --> 04:22.805
<i>Well, that depends, naturally,
on how long you want me for...</i>

04:24.599 --> 04:26.142
<i>and what you want to do.</i>

04:29.729 --> 04:30.897
<i>I know you.</i>

04:32.190 --> 04:33.650
<i>It will be very nice.</i>

04:33.733 --> 04:37.320
<i>Well, I'd like to spend the evening
with you if it's...</i>

04:38.738 --> 04:40.114
<i>if you'd like that.</i>

04:40.907 --> 04:45.119
<i>Have you ever been with a
woman before, paying her?</i>

04:45.703 --> 04:46.788
<i>Do you like it?</i>

04:47.622 --> 04:50.875
<i>I mean, I have a feeling that
that turns you on very particularly.</i>

04:51.918 --> 04:56.172
<i>What turns me on is because
I have a good imagination,</i>

04:56.255 --> 04:59.008
<i>and I like... pleasing.</i>

05:00.343 --> 05:02.261
<i>Do you mind if I take my sweater off?</i>

05:03.262 --> 05:06.015
<i>I think in the confines of one's house,
one should be</i>

05:06.683 --> 05:09.936
<i>free of clothing and inhibitions.</i>

05:10.353 --> 05:14.023
<i>Inhibitions are always nice 'cause
they're so nice to overcome</i>.

05:15.817 --> 05:17.318
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

05:17.986 --> 05:19.195
<i>I'm not.</i>

05:19.862 --> 05:23.908
<i>As long as you don't hurt me
more than I like to be hurt...</i>

05:26.119 --> 05:27.662
<i>I will do anything you ask.</i>

05:28.329 --> 05:31.624
<i>You should never be ashamed
of things like that. You mustn't be.</i>

05:31.708 --> 05:34.585
<i>You know, there's nothing wrong.
Nothing is wrong.</i>

05:35.920 --> 05:39.382
<i>I think the only way
that any of us can ever be happy</i>

05:39.465 --> 05:43.136
<i>is to let it all hang out, you know.</i>

05:43.219 --> 05:45.763
<i>Do it all and fuck it.</i>

05:50.810 --> 05:53.521
- Hi. Would you stand up, please?
- Hi.

05:58.860 --> 06:00.028
- Hello.
- Hi.

06:00.403 --> 06:04.198
Okay. Hi. Can I see your eyes?
Let me see your hair.

06:04.532 --> 06:07.160
- Take your hair ‒ your hat off.
- Take my hair off?

06:07.243 --> 06:08.870
Yeah. Okay.

06:08.953 --> 06:11.080
- Too pretty.
- Too pretty.

06:11.789 --> 06:13.958
- She's kind of exotic.
- That's the coloring.

06:14.042 --> 06:16.544
The coloring is great.
Yeah, I don't know.

06:16.627 --> 06:19.338
- It's not quite it though.
- No, not really.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.632
Hello. Can I see your hands?

06:23.301 --> 06:24.302
- Mmm.
- Thank you.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.387
- She has some funny hands.
- Yeah.

06:26.888 --> 06:28.181
- No.
- No.

06:29.098 --> 06:31.476
- Hi.
- She is great. Beautiful eyes.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.478
Yes, lovely. That's the coloring.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.396
Yeah. Let me see you smile.

06:35.646 --> 06:39.567
- I think she has that cross between ‒
- She's great. But I've seen you before.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.420
- I think so.
- Have you done any cosmetic ads?

06:41.444 --> 06:43.154
- Yes, I have.
- You have?

06:43.237 --> 06:45.823
How could they send us
people with a conflict?

06:45.907 --> 06:47.825
- I don't believe this.
- Call that agency.

06:47.909 --> 06:50.369
- Irene Dunne would've had it.
- That would be perfect.

06:51.621 --> 06:53.247
- C minus.
- C minus.

06:53.331 --> 06:55.249
Got to find her today.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.835
- Okay, that's it. Thank you, ladies.
- Thank you.

06:57.919 --> 06:59.378
Bring the next group, please.

07:08.888 --> 07:13.309
I'm exhausted. One more day
of this, and I'll pull out my hair.

07:14.685 --> 07:17.063
Hello. Hi.

07:17.146 --> 07:19.273
Okay, ladies,
just have a seat, please.

07:20.024 --> 07:21.442
It's been six months.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.987
Tom Gruneman's been missing
for half a year.

07:26.114 --> 07:30.493
And all the FBI has to offer is a report
that must bore even you.

07:31.119 --> 07:34.455
There are thousands
of honest, decent men

07:34.539 --> 07:36.040
who simply disappear every year.

07:36.124 --> 07:40.336
Neither Mrs. Gruneman nor I
are willing to just dismiss this case.

07:41.546 --> 07:44.048
Therefore we feel entitled
to investigate on our own.

07:44.841 --> 07:45.925
You're entitled.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.844
There are some very competent ‒

07:47.927 --> 07:50.847
John Klute offered us his services,
and we've accepted.

07:51.472 --> 07:55.143
Klute knew Tom, and he has
a great many ideas about the case.

07:55.226 --> 07:57.478
You ever done
any missing persons work before?

07:58.521 --> 07:59.522
No.

08:00.231 --> 08:02.608
Have you spent any
time in the city?

08:02.692 --> 08:03.693
No.

08:03.776 --> 08:05.069
Speaking frankly ‒

08:05.153 --> 08:07.280
You're wondering why
we thought of Klute.

08:07.780 --> 08:08.781
Frankly.

08:09.782 --> 08:10.867
He's interested.

08:12.034 --> 08:13.244
And he cares.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.874
Why didn't you ever find out
anything from that girl?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.877
We held her under surveillance,

08:21.669 --> 08:24.088
expecting your boy Gruneman
to show up there.

08:24.881 --> 08:27.717
He didn't. We arrested her on a CP charge.

08:28.176 --> 08:30.845
Convicted. Two months women's city prison.

08:30.928 --> 08:34.222
Offered to reduce sentence,
she cooperated.

08:34.307 --> 08:37.727
<i>She thought she remembered Gruneman
from those letters from before.</i>

08:37.809 --> 08:39.352
<i>She made that connection.</i>

08:39.437 --> 08:42.607
<i>But she hadn't seen him since then
and couldn't identify his photograph.</i>

08:43.232 --> 08:44.692
<i>A good call girl,</i>

08:45.193 --> 08:47.528
<i>she'll turn 600 or 700 tricks a year.</i>

08:47.904 --> 08:49.488
<i>Faces get blurred.</i>

08:49.906 --> 08:52.408
<i>And since then,
she's reported several incidents,</i>

08:52.491 --> 08:55.745
<i>like breather calls,
anonymous phone calls.</i>

08:55.828 --> 08:59.040
<i>Also, somebody may be following her,
watching her.</i>

08:59.373 --> 09:00.583
<i>Things like that.</i>

09:00.666 --> 09:04.420
<i>So I guess it's conceivable
that Gruneman's still around there.</i>

09:04.503 --> 09:05.838
<i>Still bugging her.</i>

09:06.589 --> 09:07.840
Hey, Trina. Bree.

09:09.717 --> 09:12.720
Listen, I could use a quick 50.
You got a commuter for me?

09:14.347 --> 09:15.348
Terrific.

09:17.683 --> 09:18.684
Yeah.

09:19.810 --> 09:20.811
Right.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.149
Terrific. Yeah. Bye.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.843
Hi. I'm Bree.

09:52.927 --> 09:54.887
Yeah. Uh, come in, please.

09:55.346 --> 09:57.848
I'm glad to know you, Bree.

09:59.267 --> 10:00.559
I'm glad you could come.

10:01.394 --> 10:02.561
Sit down, please.

10:06.816 --> 10:08.526
- Um...
- Where you from?

10:08.943 --> 10:10.361
Can I get you a drink?

10:11.320 --> 10:13.698
I'd like a ginger ale. Thank you.
That would be nice.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.950
I'm from Chicago.

10:16.367 --> 10:17.994
You come to New York often?

10:18.077 --> 10:22.164
Often? No, I don't come
to New York too often.

10:23.374 --> 10:26.168
- Two or three times a year, maybe.
- That's too bad.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.557
What kind of party did you have in mind?

10:39.640 --> 10:43.144
We could...

10:45.354 --> 10:48.065
We could have a nice
half-and-half party for 50.

10:48.649 --> 10:49.817
Mm-hmm.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.777
We could have a good time for 50.

10:52.570 --> 10:55.156
Or if you wanted something extra,
it would be a little more.

10:55.698 --> 10:59.243
Um... Yeah. Have...

11:01.746 --> 11:04.915
- Maybe a nice...
- Listen, would it be all right...

11:08.711 --> 11:12.089
- Tell me. What do you want? Tell me.
- I mean...

11:12.173 --> 11:14.467
Tell me what you want. Hmm?

11:15.926 --> 11:18.637
Oh, wow.

11:19.930 --> 11:22.391
Wow. That sounds fantastic.

11:24.310 --> 11:28.147
That's so exciting,
but it's going to cost you more.

11:29.523 --> 11:32.151
That's fantastic.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.778
That's going to be 100.

11:35.738 --> 11:39.909
- Sure. Fine. Oh, yes. Very good.
- Yeah.

11:39.992 --> 11:41.744
- 100.
- Very good.

11:42.578 --> 11:45.039
Mmm. I like to get business out of the way
at the beginning.

11:45.122 --> 11:47.583
That way we don't have to think about it.
Then we can...

11:49.251 --> 11:51.045
just have a good time.

11:51.629 --> 11:54.215
Mmm. I like your mind.

11:55.216 --> 11:57.301
- Yeah.
- So.

11:58.803 --> 12:02.473
Chicago.

12:18.197 --> 12:19.281
Is this the bed?

12:21.575 --> 12:22.785
This is the bed.

12:23.994 --> 12:27.206
Very nice. Very nice. Very nice.

12:49.061 --> 12:51.897
There's the bed in operating position.

13:03.909 --> 13:06.036
You're so nice.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.964
Come here. Come here.

13:20.509 --> 13:23.721

Hello?

18:46.877 --> 18:47.878
Who is it?

18:47.961 --> 18:51.131
Miss Daniel, my name is Klute. John Klute.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.550
- I'd like to talk to you.
- What do you want?

18:53.634 --> 18:55.844
My name is John Klute.

18:57.763 --> 18:58.764
You said that.

18:58.847 --> 19:02.559
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you
some questions about Tom Gruneman.

19:03.727 --> 19:06.897
- Who?
- Tom Gruneman. He wrote you some letters.

19:08.023 --> 19:09.149
Wow.

19:09.233 --> 19:10.442
He was a research engineer

19:10.526 --> 19:12.986
at the Tuscarora Laboratories
in Pennsylvania,

19:13.445 --> 19:15.614
and he disappeared from there
last December.

19:16.073 --> 19:18.659
- And I've been hired to look for him.
- Why?

19:19.785 --> 19:22.162
You know what I'm talking about,
Miss Daniel.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.206
Honest.

19:24.832 --> 19:26.750
Can I ask you some questions, please?

19:28.252 --> 19:30.671
Do you have any identification?

19:39.721 --> 19:41.390
You're not a cop?

19:41.473 --> 19:42.808
You're not FBI?

19:44.059 --> 19:45.519
You're a private detective?

19:46.562 --> 19:48.772
And you just want to ask me
some questions.

19:48.856 --> 19:49.857
Uh-huh.

20:22.556 --> 20:25.017
They're not very recent.
That's last year.

20:25.100 --> 20:28.478
They're quite good. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

20:30.105 --> 20:34.026
Tell me, what have you done that I might
have seen on Broadway or off-Broadway?

20:34.568 --> 20:36.737
Well, I study with George Tainter.

20:36.820 --> 20:40.198
George? George is very good.
He's a good man to begin with.

20:40.657 --> 20:44.244
And I've been in two of his productions ‒
workshop-type productions.

20:44.328 --> 20:45.621
Workshop.

20:46.955 --> 20:48.498
They're very nice. Very nice.

20:48.582 --> 20:51.001
Tell me, how do you feel
about being an actress?

20:51.710 --> 20:53.170
- I like it very much.
- Mm-hmm.

20:53.253 --> 20:55.297
- Do you think you know yourself?
- I like acting.

20:57.549 --> 21:00.302
- As much as anybody, I guess.
- Do you really know yourself?

21:00.385 --> 21:01.762
- No.
- That's very important.

21:01.845 --> 21:04.890
- I forget myself when I act.
- No, you can't forget yourself.

21:04.973 --> 21:08.018
You have to know yourself
and kind of like yourself.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.561
You have to relate.

21:09.645 --> 21:10.812
- Relate to people.
- Mmm.

21:10.896 --> 21:12.856
I had an identity crisis two years ago,

21:12.940 --> 21:15.525
and since then,
I've been working to know myself.

21:15.859 --> 21:17.611
That's very important. Very ‒

21:17.694 --> 21:19.696
Don't hide your face.

21:19.780 --> 21:22.783
You have a nice face.
Excuse me. Just a second.

21:27.204 --> 21:30.040
Jillian? Yes, okay, send her in.

21:30.457 --> 21:33.669
Well, I'm very busy.
It was wonderful for you to stop by.

21:33.752 --> 21:35.879
If you're in anything
off-off-Broadway or ‒

21:38.423 --> 21:39.591
How are you today?

21:41.927 --> 21:43.887
I'm not gonna be able
to come back anymore.

21:43.971 --> 21:45.222
I'm sorry.

21:46.723 --> 21:48.433
Because I just can't afford it.

21:50.394 --> 21:51.687
Did I fail you, Bree?

21:52.312 --> 21:55.482
I've been coming here all this time
and paying you all this money.

21:55.565 --> 21:57.067
Why do I still want to trick?

21:57.150 --> 22:01.446
Why do I still walk by a phone
and want to pick up the phone and call?

22:02.072 --> 22:04.366
Did you think I had some magic potion?

22:05.242 --> 22:07.411
You'd come in and tell me
what your problem was,

22:07.494 --> 22:09.037
and I would just take it away?

22:10.038 --> 22:13.500
What's the difference between going out
on a call as a model or as an actress,

22:13.583 --> 22:14.584
and as a call girl?

22:14.668 --> 22:16.169
You're successful as a call girl ‒

22:16.253 --> 22:19.631
Because when you're a call girl,
you control it, that's why.

22:19.715 --> 22:23.135
Because someone wants you.

22:24.553 --> 22:25.929
Not me.

22:26.013 --> 22:29.474
I mean, there are some johns
that I have regularly that want <i>me,</i>

22:29.558 --> 22:30.684
and that's terrific,

22:31.476 --> 22:32.978
but they want a woman.

22:34.229 --> 22:35.647
And I know I'm good.

22:36.857 --> 22:40.527
And I arrive at their hotel
or their apartment...

22:42.946 --> 22:47.367
and they're usually nervous,
which is fine, because I'm not.

22:47.451 --> 22:48.660
I know what I'm doing.

22:51.663 --> 22:53.081
And for an hour...

22:55.417 --> 22:57.419
for an hour,
I'm the best actress in the world,

22:57.502 --> 22:59.254
and the best fuck in the world.

22:59.337 --> 23:00.547
And...

23:00.630 --> 23:03.425
Why'd you say you're the best actress
in the world at that time?

23:03.508 --> 23:06.261
Because it's an act.
That's what's nice about it.

23:06.344 --> 23:08.764
You don't have to feel anything.
You don't have to...

23:11.058 --> 23:12.059
care about anything.

23:12.142 --> 23:14.436
You don't have to like anybody.
You just...

23:18.106 --> 23:19.357
You just...

23:20.525 --> 23:22.235
lead them by the ring in their nose

23:22.319 --> 23:24.738
in the direction
they think they want to go in.

23:25.363 --> 23:29.451
And you get a lot of money out of them
in as short a period of time as possible.

23:30.202 --> 23:33.622
And you control it,
and you call the shots.

23:34.206 --> 23:36.792
And I always feel just great afterwards.

23:38.376 --> 23:40.337
- And you enjoyed it?
- No.

23:40.921 --> 23:41.922
Why not?

23:43.048 --> 23:45.926
- You said there's nothing wrong with it.
- There's a difference ‒

23:46.009 --> 23:49.679
I don't think there's anything wrong
with it... morally.

23:49.763 --> 23:51.807
I didn't enjoy it physically.

23:52.224 --> 23:57.312
I... I came to enjoy it
because it made me feel good.

23:59.356 --> 24:01.441
It made me feel like I wasn't alone.

24:01.525 --> 24:03.151
It made me feel...

24:07.364 --> 24:09.199
that I had some control over myself,

24:09.282 --> 24:12.077
that I had some control over my life,

24:12.744 --> 24:15.038
that I could determine things for myself.

24:16.331 --> 24:19.042
<i>Oh, I don't know.
I don't know why I'm here.</i>

24:19.709 --> 24:23.130
<i>It's so silly to think that somebody else
can help anybody, isn't it?</i>

24:31.138 --> 24:33.974
<i>I could come over tonight. Are you alone?</i>

24:35.433 --> 24:36.768
<i>In about an hour.</i>

24:38.520 --> 24:40.272
<i>Okay. See you in an hour.</i>

25:44.169 --> 25:45.170
Bree.

25:55.305 --> 25:57.474
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

25:57.557 --> 25:58.600
Here.

26:04.898 --> 26:05.899
Enjoy.

26:10.362 --> 26:12.989
- It's good to see you again.
- Likewise.

26:14.199 --> 26:16.201
I just got back from Cannes, you know.

26:17.661 --> 26:18.745
And I...

26:21.665 --> 26:26.711
well, I have something rather exciting
to tell you.

26:26.795 --> 26:27.796
Yes?

26:30.131 --> 26:31.508
Cannes was very amusing.

26:32.425 --> 26:34.678
We played baccarat and chemin de fer.

26:35.679 --> 26:39.432
And a very nice little Italian marquis
was rather enthusiastic about me.

26:43.103 --> 26:46.189
But a young man can be so silly.

26:49.693 --> 26:50.819
And then one night...

26:53.113 --> 26:54.698
at the gambling tables...

26:56.700 --> 26:57.742
I saw him.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.412
A stranger. He was looking at me.

27:02.706 --> 27:05.542
He was standing very still
on the other side of the room.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.920
And his eyes were looking right into me.

27:11.298 --> 27:13.717
And I knew that,
for the first time in my life...

27:18.013 --> 27:19.139
Please.

27:23.351 --> 27:25.020
Not young. He wasn't young.

27:26.438 --> 27:27.856
He had gray sideburns.

27:29.524 --> 27:32.777
- Actually, he looked rather like you.
- Yes?

27:36.865 --> 27:38.533
No one could tell me who he was.

27:40.285 --> 27:42.704
Was he an exiled prince or a mercenary?

27:46.166 --> 27:50.003
But there was a feeling stirring
inside me, a pagan feeling.

27:54.215 --> 27:57.469
And the next day on the beach,
in my beach pavilion...

27:59.054 --> 28:01.431
it was so warm on the sand.

28:01.890 --> 28:03.308
And I saw him again.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.312
He was staring at me.

28:11.107 --> 28:12.984
His eyes were burning into me.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.072
I was helpless.

28:18.490 --> 28:21.993
He didn't even have to say anything,
and I knew.

28:23.578 --> 28:25.038
I knew that somehow...

28:30.877 --> 28:32.754
I've never liked young men.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.051
And I knew that...

28:39.677 --> 28:41.638
that he would awaken something in me...

28:43.765 --> 28:45.892
that no young man had ever awakened.

28:50.063 --> 28:51.064
He was...

28:52.107 --> 28:53.733
He was so wise.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.903
And he taught me so many things...

28:59.280 --> 29:00.615
with his hands...

29:02.325 --> 29:03.701
and with his mind.

29:04.285 --> 29:06.621
I felt so beautiful.

29:20.009 --> 29:24.347
Miss Daniels. Can I come upstairs
and ask you some questions now?

29:36.734 --> 29:38.027
You bastard.

29:40.488 --> 29:42.073
Is this the shakedown, hon?

29:43.074 --> 29:45.743
- You picked a loser. I don't have it.
- I'm looking for Tom ‒

29:45.827 --> 29:49.497
Jesus. You think I'd be living in this kip
if I were taking calls full-time?

29:49.581 --> 29:50.957
I'd be back on Park Avenue.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.667
Can I ask you some questions?

29:54.711 --> 29:57.005
Or you'll get me thrown back in the brig,
you mean?

30:25.158 --> 30:26.242
Have a seat.

30:31.831 --> 30:33.124
Would you like some wine?

30:34.209 --> 30:36.169
- Or some beer?
- No, thank you.

30:38.129 --> 30:39.881
There isn't any beer anyway.

30:46.179 --> 30:48.890
Look, I've already told the police
everything I know.

30:48.973 --> 30:50.934
I don't even remember the schlub.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.608
Yeah, they showed me that already.

30:58.983 --> 31:00.818
- I understand this is Gruneman.
- Mm-hmm.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.529
I told them, I don't remember.

31:06.574 --> 31:08.618
Family-type man, it figures.

31:14.791 --> 31:19.712
Look, will you please just try to get it
from my side?

31:21.256 --> 31:22.423
A year ago...

31:23.633 --> 31:25.343
I was in the life full-time,

31:25.927 --> 31:27.178
living on Park Avenue.

31:28.930 --> 31:31.933
This very nice apartment,
leather furniture.

31:33.851 --> 31:36.396
And then the cops dropped on me,
they caged me.

31:36.479 --> 31:37.981
Started asking me about a guy,

31:38.064 --> 31:40.984
some guy that I'm supposed
to have seen a year before that.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.318
Two years ago!

31:43.403 --> 31:44.696
He could be in Yemen.

31:46.864 --> 31:49.867
Gruneman, what does that mean?
It's a name. I don't know him.

31:50.201 --> 31:53.371
They start showing me these pictures,
and they don't mean anything to me.

31:54.247 --> 31:56.958
Then they started asking me
if I'd been getting letters

31:57.333 --> 31:59.252
from some guy out in Cabbageville.

31:59.335 --> 32:00.420
Tuscarora.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.299
Yeah, all right, I had been.

32:05.466 --> 32:07.760
Very sick letters.

32:09.596 --> 32:11.889
So they said, "Well, that's Gruneman."

32:11.973 --> 32:14.225
So would you please tell us
when you and he...

32:17.312 --> 32:20.940
Well, there was a guy... once, a freak.

32:22.025 --> 32:25.278
Could have been him. Apparently,
Gruneman liked to beat up on girls.

32:26.863 --> 32:29.782
And, well, this guy hired me
and then he tried to kill me.

32:29.866 --> 32:31.367
That was about two years ago.

32:32.410 --> 32:36.080
Tommy baby, olly, olly, in free, kid.
I got the gumdrops.

32:41.044 --> 32:43.296
You remind me of my uncle.

32:45.506 --> 32:48.426
What else do you remember
about the man who beat you up?

32:49.677 --> 32:50.678
Nothing.

32:51.721 --> 32:53.848
Except that he wasn't kidding, that's all.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.851
See, usually it's a fake out.

32:57.143 --> 32:58.645
You probably know about that.

33:00.063 --> 33:02.541
They pretend to tie you up,
you wear a dress with a cloth belt,

33:02.565 --> 33:04.025
and they pretend to whip you.

33:05.068 --> 33:06.778
It's their money, I don't care.

33:06.861 --> 33:09.405
I'll swing from a shower rod
and whistle "Maytime,"

33:09.489 --> 33:12.742
except this guy really freaked out on it.

33:13.910 --> 33:16.329
But you cannot identify this man
as Tom Gruneman?

33:16.663 --> 33:18.665
I can't identify him as anybody.

33:22.794 --> 33:25.755
So... is that it?

33:30.593 --> 33:31.719
Listen...

33:34.847 --> 33:36.557
why don't you go downstairs...

33:37.517 --> 33:39.143
You have such a nice mouth.

33:39.227 --> 33:40.728
...and get those tapes,

33:41.396 --> 33:43.314
and bring them back up here...

33:44.440 --> 33:46.859
and we'll have a party, you and I?

33:46.943 --> 33:48.111
Wouldn't that be nice?

33:51.864 --> 33:54.992
What about afterwards,
about the telephone calls?

33:55.868 --> 33:57.370
Just phone calls, right?

33:58.830 --> 34:01.874
What is it? The phone rings,
you answer, there's nobody there.

34:01.958 --> 34:04.478
Kids getting their kicks, burglars
finding out if the apartment's empty.

34:04.502 --> 34:07.213
It happens all the time in New York.
It doesn't mean anything.

34:07.296 --> 34:09.297
You reported that you had been followed.

34:09.841 --> 34:15.221
Look, I'm sorry.
I've been... leading everybody astray.

34:15.304 --> 34:16.472
It doesn't...

34:17.514 --> 34:19.475
Yeah, okay, I get these feelings,

34:19.976 --> 34:22.145
but they're just feelings, that's just me.

34:24.480 --> 34:27.442
I'm sure you'll find this amusing,

34:28.025 --> 34:29.819
but I'm afraid of the dark.

34:31.279 --> 34:36.159
Or sometimes I get spooked.
I think I see people, hear things.

34:36.492 --> 34:39.661
Or I go out in the morning and think
somebody's been prying open my mailbox.

34:39.746 --> 34:43.875
Or if there's trash in front of my door,
I think somebody's trying to freak me out.

34:45.793 --> 34:48.963
It's just nerves. I'm a nervous broad.
It doesn't mean anything.

34:56.512 --> 34:57.597
Bree Daniels.

35:02.894 --> 35:04.896
How is Ted? Yeah.

35:11.611 --> 35:14.197
Thank you. Thank you very much.

35:16.073 --> 35:19.243
I'd love to.
Maybe the next time you're in town?

35:20.077 --> 35:23.206
I'd like to meet you very much.
You've got a nice voice.

35:24.582 --> 35:25.583
I...

35:28.669 --> 35:31.923
Actually, I'm having a conversation
with a very nice cop.

35:32.882 --> 35:35.134
He's not a cop actually,
he's a private de ‒

35:42.183 --> 35:43.935
Is that how you get most of your dates?

35:44.018 --> 35:46.521
Somebody gives your name to somebody else?

35:46.604 --> 35:47.772
Most of them, yeah.

35:48.564 --> 35:51.192
And that how you met the man
who beat you up?

35:51.567 --> 35:53.736
I don't remember.
It was two years ago. God.

35:53.820 --> 35:55.738
How else do you get dates then, pimps?

35:57.240 --> 35:59.909
Oh, you're very square, cookie.

35:59.992 --> 36:02.995
No, pimps don't get dates for you,
they just take your money.

36:05.039 --> 36:08.125
The police have given me a list of names.

36:08.876 --> 36:12.755
I'd like to ask you about them.
Frank Ligourin?

36:14.298 --> 36:16.300
I'm sure this is gonna amuse you too.

36:16.384 --> 36:18.469
But I'm trying to get away from all that.

36:19.178 --> 36:21.180
What about this evening, the old man?

36:23.140 --> 36:25.810
You saw that? Goddamn you!

36:27.728 --> 36:29.438
He's 70 years old.

36:30.064 --> 36:31.065
His wife is dead,

36:31.148 --> 36:34.068
he's been cutting garments
since he was 14.

36:34.151 --> 36:35.963
He's maybe in his whole life
had one week vacation,

36:35.987 --> 36:37.363
and I'm all he's got.

36:37.446 --> 36:39.198
And he never lays a hand on me.

36:39.782 --> 36:41.158
What harm is there in that?

36:43.202 --> 36:46.539
And what's your bag, Klute?
What do you like?

36:46.622 --> 36:48.708
You a talker? A button freak?

36:49.500 --> 36:52.545
Like to have your chest walked around
with high-heel shoes?

36:52.628 --> 36:55.006
- Like to have us watch you tinkle?
- Okay.

36:55.423 --> 36:57.633
Or do you get it off
wearing women's clothes?

36:57.967 --> 37:00.344
- Goddamn hypocrite squares!
- Okay.

37:03.472 --> 37:05.975
I hope this isn't going
to make my cold any worse.

37:08.519 --> 37:10.396
Now tell me about Frank Ligourin.

37:11.689 --> 37:13.357
He was my old man. We broke up.

37:13.441 --> 37:15.902
When? When did you break up?

37:16.360 --> 37:17.570
About eight months ago.

37:18.529 --> 37:20.698
Would you mind not doing that, ple ‒

37:22.533 --> 37:23.534
What?

37:25.620 --> 37:26.621
Okay?

37:30.166 --> 37:32.627
Well, I thought I could trade you
for those tapes.

37:34.420 --> 37:37.048
Doesn't it get lonely down there
in your little room?

37:39.008 --> 37:42.219
Maybe I could bring you some friends.
I've got some terrific friends.

37:42.303 --> 37:43.304
No, thank you.

37:43.596 --> 37:47.099
Men have paid $200 for me,
and here you are turning down a freebie.

37:47.767 --> 37:49.767
You could get
a perfectly good dishwasher for that.

38:04.784 --> 38:07.411
What are you doing with my keys?

38:07.495 --> 38:08.496
Give me your hand.

38:19.256 --> 38:20.466
I knew it.

38:25.763 --> 38:27.390
Oh.

38:28.683 --> 38:33.104
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to sit you down on the bed.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.984
There's someone on the roof.

38:39.443 --> 38:42.947
Sit. Sit!

40:54.787 --> 40:55.788
Tom?

41:02.837 --> 41:03.838
Tom?

41:36.453 --> 41:37.955
- You didn't get him.
- No.

41:40.457 --> 41:41.584
Was it Gruneman?

41:42.209 --> 41:43.294
I didn't see him.

41:48.549 --> 41:50.092
Who sent you on that date?

41:55.431 --> 41:56.557
Frankie Ligourin.

41:59.685 --> 42:02.521
You and I will go talk
to Frank Ligourin tomorrow.

42:38.515 --> 42:41.518
<i>Don't be afraid. I'm not.</i>

42:45.606 --> 42:47.191
<i>Would you like me to hold you?</i>

42:48.275 --> 42:51.654
<i>I'm just trying to figure you out.</i>

42:52.529 --> 42:56.116
<i>I may say, not many people have
been very successful at that.</i>

42:57.826 --> 43:00.788
<i>That's all right. I'll figure you
out before the evening is over.</i>

43:03.207 --> 43:06.710
<i>I hope you do.
And, in a way, I hope you don't.</i>

43:09.338 --> 43:12.758
<i>The only responsibility you
have to me is to enjoy yourself.</i>

43:13.842 --> 43:16.971
<i>Inhibitions are always nice
'cause they're so nice to overcome.</i>

43:18.097 --> 43:19.473
<i>'Cause I'm very bad. I ‒</i>

43:19.556 --> 43:21.517
<i>In what way? How are you bad?</i>

43:21.600 --> 43:25.062
<i>In my head, I have very wicked ideas.</i>

43:27.189 --> 43:28.274
<i>Lots of them.</i>

43:28.691 --> 43:30.567
<i>I'm sure as you're sitting
at your great desk,</i>

43:30.651 --> 43:33.737
<i>you have all kinds of strange things
going through your mind.</i>

43:33.821 --> 43:36.240
<i>You should never be ashamed
of things like that.</i>

43:36.991 --> 43:38.158
<i>Nothing is wrong.</i>

43:39.535 --> 43:42.538
<i>You know that I will do anything you ask.</i>

43:44.248 --> 43:49.003
<i>I think the only way that any of us
can ever be happy is to...</i>

43:49.336 --> 43:51.297
<i>is to let it all hang out.</i>

44:03.225 --> 44:05.769
I was just finishing up some work,

44:05.853 --> 44:07.479
mocking up a few photographs.

44:08.272 --> 44:10.399
I used to be a photographer.
Bree tell you?

44:12.026 --> 44:13.485
Before I got into publishing.

44:13.861 --> 44:15.141
He knows you're a pimp, Frankie.

44:16.488 --> 44:17.906
He knows you were my pimp.

44:18.449 --> 44:21.618
Excuse me.
Bree, why don't you wait outside?

44:28.500 --> 44:32.171
I always respected Bree.
I'd like to make something clear.

44:32.254 --> 44:35.132
- I just got a couple of questions.
- I want to make something clear.

44:36.133 --> 44:38.969
You know, I don't go after a girl.

44:40.179 --> 44:41.430
Girl comes to me.

44:42.431 --> 44:44.308
Her choice. Right?

44:44.641 --> 44:46.477
I'm looking for a man, Tom Gruneman.

44:46.560 --> 44:49.563
Miss Daniels tells me the date
that beat her up two years ago

44:49.646 --> 44:50.814
might've been that man,

44:50.898 --> 44:52.649
and that you sent her on that date.

44:52.733 --> 44:54.777
Two years ago? Sorry.

44:56.820 --> 44:59.114
I understand you use narcotics.

44:59.198 --> 45:03.911
Maybe I could have someone come over
and look at your... arms.

45:04.912 --> 45:07.414
I may stand better with the cops
than you do.

45:09.041 --> 45:10.709
Why don't you sit down and relax?

45:17.925 --> 45:21.553
It was a family matter
between the girls.

45:21.970 --> 45:25.224
Had two other girls then,
two other girls besides Bree.

45:26.600 --> 45:29.103
One of them, Jane McKenna,

45:30.020 --> 45:33.232
she blows a little jealous of Bree,
you know?

45:34.233 --> 45:35.526
Bree comes first.

45:36.485 --> 45:40.030
And evidently she knew this freak,
beats up on women.

45:40.906 --> 45:43.033
She cons me into passing him on to Bree.

45:44.326 --> 45:45.744
So Bree'd get hurt.

45:46.703 --> 45:48.831
I didn't know till afterwards.

45:49.706 --> 45:53.210
You can't tell them that one of their own
in-laws laid a freak on them.

45:54.503 --> 45:55.629
Peace in the family.

45:57.464 --> 46:00.050
Beyond that, I don't know.

46:00.717 --> 46:01.885
That's all she wrote.

46:05.180 --> 46:06.223
Did you see the man?

46:07.808 --> 46:08.809
No.

46:11.645 --> 46:13.480
How can I get hold of Jane McKenna?

46:15.607 --> 46:17.609
Baby, would I be telling you all this?

46:18.235 --> 46:19.778
She copped out long ago.

46:21.196 --> 46:22.698
She committed suicide, Baxter.

46:26.618 --> 46:29.288
And the other girl, what's her name?

46:29.371 --> 46:31.039
- Arlyn.
- Arlyn...

46:31.123 --> 46:32.124
Page.

46:32.416 --> 46:33.542
How do I find her?

46:33.625 --> 46:36.837
I don't know. She's a junkie.

46:37.629 --> 46:41.592
Make that scene, you could be anywhere.
Here, San Francisco. They just drop out.

46:44.928 --> 46:46.180
Anything else?

46:52.186 --> 46:53.854
Did you like my friend Frankie?

46:55.606 --> 46:56.648
Not very much.

46:56.732 --> 47:00.569
- Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
- Where can I find Arlyn Page?

47:01.445 --> 47:04.031
You're not going to find Arlyn Page.
She's a junkie.

47:04.823 --> 47:07.075
Didn't he tell you
that he sent me that guy?

47:08.327 --> 47:10.412
Jane McKenna sent you that guy.

47:15.792 --> 47:16.793
Well, she's dead.

47:17.628 --> 47:18.629
Hey.

47:23.884 --> 47:25.135
Your tapes.

47:25.844 --> 47:30.015
Golly gee, just what I've always wanted.
Dirty phone calls. Ah!

47:32.184 --> 47:33.185
What for?

47:34.728 --> 47:37.773
I'm through with your part of it.
You told me what you could.

47:38.440 --> 47:41.276
Well, tell me, Klute.

47:42.277 --> 47:44.696
Did we get you a little, huh?
Just a little bit?

47:44.780 --> 47:46.281
Us city folk?

47:46.365 --> 47:49.618
The sin, the glitter, the wickedness, huh?

47:51.537 --> 47:53.288
All that's so pathetic.

47:56.416 --> 47:57.501
Fuck off.

48:11.265 --> 48:13.475
I'll tell you something, Jack.

48:14.101 --> 48:16.603
It is in the bells that I hear my voices.

48:17.521 --> 48:20.691
Not today when they all rang.
That was nothing but jangling.

48:21.024 --> 48:26.238
But here, in this corner,
where the bells come down from heaven

48:26.321 --> 48:28.073
and the echoes linger...

48:29.324 --> 48:33.745
or in the fields where they come across
the quiet of the countryside,

48:33.829 --> 48:35.455
my voices are in them.

48:37.124 --> 48:39.376
- Hark.
- Not so ‒ Gently.

48:42.087 --> 48:43.213
Do you hear?

48:43.755 --> 48:45.591
<i>♪ Dear child of God ♪</i>

48:45.674 --> 48:47.384
That's just what you said.

48:48.594 --> 48:50.971
At the half hour, they will say:

48:51.054 --> 48:53.390
<i>♪ Be brave, go on ♪</i>

48:54.558 --> 48:56.768
At the three-quarters, they will say:

48:56.852 --> 48:59.605
<i>♪ I am thy help ♪</i>

49:01.440 --> 49:05.569
But it is at the hour
when the great bell goes after:

49:05.652 --> 49:09.448
<i>♪ God will save France ♪</i>

49:10.282 --> 49:12.242
It is then that St. Margaret
and St. Cath ‒

49:12.326 --> 49:13.952
Thank you. Thank you very much.

49:15.329 --> 49:16.330
Script, please.

49:17.456 --> 49:19.458
- Very interesting accent.
- Thank you.

49:19.541 --> 49:20.542
Booth.

49:25.380 --> 49:26.381
Thank you.

49:41.438 --> 49:43.523
All right. So what do you want, cop?

49:44.483 --> 49:46.610
I can't find Arlyn Page without your help.

49:46.693 --> 49:48.362
I told you you wouldn't find her.

49:48.445 --> 49:52.407
If I can't find her, I can't find him.
If I can't find him, you're in trouble.

49:52.491 --> 49:53.700
So what do you say?

49:56.912 --> 49:57.913
Okay?

50:04.586 --> 50:07.422
It's going to cost. Time is money.

50:08.382 --> 50:10.676
Okay, well, I can pay you $100.

50:10.759 --> 50:12.886
A hundred dollars.
I can make that at a lunch break.

50:12.969 --> 50:14.721
A hundred dollars is all I've got.

50:16.139 --> 50:17.974
Hey, you were very good upstairs.

50:22.646 --> 50:24.231
Kid, will you buy me a coffee?

50:25.816 --> 50:27.651
- Buy you lunch. You want lunch?
- Mmm.

50:27.734 --> 50:29.027
Come on.

50:30.028 --> 50:31.738
Whenever it suits you.

50:31.822 --> 50:35.826
No, make it Monday at 8:00 p.m.

50:37.786 --> 50:41.873
I said, Monday, 8:00 p.m., baby.
Now, don't be naughty.

50:46.461 --> 50:48.130
He's a lovely man.

50:49.965 --> 50:54.553
Comes here, spends a bundle of money,
and never even touches the girls.

50:54.636 --> 50:58.098
Comes from Grosse Pointe,
has a big house, eight servants,

50:59.015 --> 51:02.144
but all he wants to do is come here
and scrub out my bathroom.

51:03.729 --> 51:07.065
8:00 p.m., Monday, Mr. Clean.

51:11.319 --> 51:15.031
Now, Arlyn Page, I had to let her go.

51:16.199 --> 51:18.243
No. With the kind of people I get here,

51:18.326 --> 51:21.288
I couldn't have a gal
who was half zonked out all the time.

51:22.164 --> 51:24.624
You know, I get the crème de la crème.

51:25.333 --> 51:26.668
No, she was trouble.

51:27.085 --> 51:29.963
And I don't allow any trouble here.

51:31.506 --> 51:33.049
<i>Che ci può fare?</i>

51:34.176 --> 51:37.053
<i>Honi soit qui mal y pense.</i>

51:37.137 --> 51:39.556
Do you have any idea
where I can look for her?

51:40.557 --> 51:43.393
Oh, try Momma Reese's.

51:44.728 --> 51:50.192
Bree... if you ever get lonely,
or you haven't got any place else to go,

51:50.275 --> 51:51.276
you come here.

51:51.359 --> 51:53.737
You'll always have a home here.

52:05.540 --> 52:06.541
Why?

52:07.250 --> 52:08.335
She's a junkie.

52:09.586 --> 52:12.172
She was with you after she left Frankie,
wasn't she?

52:12.881 --> 52:14.132
Well, she's not now.

52:17.427 --> 52:19.179
I tried to do everything for her.

52:19.679 --> 52:22.474
I took her into my own place,
my own little flat on 1st.

52:22.557 --> 52:24.017
You know that sweet place?

52:24.392 --> 52:27.562
We could've had everything together,
everything.

52:28.605 --> 52:30.524
Then the bitch sold my mink.

52:33.109 --> 52:34.945
Do you know anybody that's seen her,
at all?

52:35.028 --> 52:37.322
As far as I'm concerned, she's dead.

52:43.829 --> 52:44.830
Okay.

54:02.449 --> 54:03.533
Who is it?

54:04.701 --> 54:05.911
Bree Daniels.

54:12.626 --> 54:13.835
I couldn't sleep.

54:15.045 --> 54:16.796
I keep thinking I hear noises.

54:22.093 --> 54:23.219
Can I come in?

54:24.220 --> 54:25.221
Come in, yeah.

54:39.653 --> 54:41.173
Oh, it's probably just my imagination.

54:43.323 --> 54:44.324
Sit down.

54:51.623 --> 54:53.291
I'm sorry I woke you up.

54:54.334 --> 54:55.502
I just...

54:57.253 --> 54:59.422
I don't think he's going
to come back again.

55:01.049 --> 55:03.635
I just don't want to be alone right now.

55:06.137 --> 55:07.931
Do you mind if I stay here a while?

55:10.600 --> 55:12.519
If you'd like to go back upstairs,
I'd come ‒

55:12.602 --> 55:14.688
I'd really rather not go upstairs.

55:35.333 --> 55:38.044
Why don't you lie down here? Sleep here.

55:39.170 --> 55:40.964
- Come on.
- Where are you going to sleep?

55:41.047 --> 55:42.215
I'll pull that out.

55:50.348 --> 55:51.433
Lie down.

56:34.017 --> 56:35.060
Thank you.

56:39.981 --> 56:41.024
Good night.

56:43.526 --> 56:44.903
Good night.

57:35.120 --> 57:36.121
Hi.

58:23.251 --> 58:24.252
What's the matter?

58:26.880 --> 58:28.381
You were terrific.

58:30.758 --> 58:32.719
A real tiger.

58:42.520 --> 58:44.814
Are you upset because you didn't
make me come?

58:46.399 --> 58:47.817
I never come with a john.

58:53.948 --> 58:57.243
Don't feel bad about losing your virtue.
I sort of knew you would.

58:58.411 --> 58:59.996
Everybody always does.

59:13.092 --> 59:16.512
Arlyn Page? Yeah, she was with me
about three months.

59:16.596 --> 59:18.806
She was lucky I kept her that long.

59:18.890 --> 59:20.266
She was out of it.

59:21.184 --> 59:25.146
Somebody said she was streetwalking
over on Lexington Avenue.

59:25.563 --> 59:26.731
Or was it 8th?

59:27.273 --> 59:28.524
You might take a look.

59:29.442 --> 59:31.986
Or try Bill Azure, if you can find him.

59:34.989 --> 59:37.492
Yeah, she used to dress the way you do.

59:39.619 --> 59:41.871
The whore? Yeah. I threw her out.

59:43.831 --> 59:45.708
Do you know where she went from here?

59:46.209 --> 59:48.628
Live like animals, her and the man.

59:49.212 --> 59:50.213
Out.

59:50.505 --> 59:51.965
She was living with a man?

59:52.757 --> 59:54.592
He was worse than the whore.

01:00:28.001 --> 01:00:29.168
Cappy?

01:00:29.836 --> 01:00:31.546
- Arlyn Page?
- Arlyn, it's Bree.

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:32.880
Cappy, is that you?

01:00:33.298 --> 01:00:34.299
It's all right.

01:00:34.382 --> 01:00:35.883
Cappy, we got a radio ‒

01:00:37.176 --> 01:00:38.386
Arlyn, it's okay.

01:00:42.432 --> 01:00:46.644
Bree, honey, I'm waiting for someone.

01:00:48.021 --> 01:00:50.261
You've gotta help us.
We've gotta ask you some questions.

01:00:52.942 --> 01:00:54.610
Can't you see I'm strung out?

01:00:55.486 --> 01:00:57.447
It'll only take a couple of minutes.
Ask her.

01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:59.324
A couple of years ago
with Frankie and Jane,

01:00:59.407 --> 01:01:02.660
- Jane sent me a guy that beat up on me.
- If he sees you, he won't come.

01:01:02.994 --> 01:01:05.121
Was she seeing a freak,
one of her regular johns?

01:01:05.204 --> 01:01:06.372
Was he a freak?

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:08.750
Yeah. What about it?

01:01:09.584 --> 01:01:10.918
Did he come around a lot?

01:01:21.054 --> 01:01:22.847
No, he was an older guy. Guy was older.

01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:24.557
It's very important.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:27.435
- Arlyn, get them out of here!
- I'm begging you.

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:30.855
It's very important, please.
Can you give me a description of him?

01:01:30.938 --> 01:01:32.357
Cappy.

01:01:33.441 --> 01:01:35.651
Cappy, listen. Don't ‒
Listen to me. Cappy!

01:01:35.735 --> 01:01:38.279
Cappy, don't run, Cappy.
Cappy, don't run!

01:01:38.363 --> 01:01:40.365
I've got a radio. Cappy!

She wouldn't be reliable anyhow,
a narcotics addict.

01:06:07.381 --> 01:06:10.051
Well, I believed her.
I believed her absolutely.

01:06:10.635 --> 01:06:12.845
The man who did those beatings
was not Tom Gruneman.

01:06:12.928 --> 01:06:15.181
Suppose it wasn't Tom.
Where does that get you?

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.184
Tom is still connected to the case
because of the letters,

01:06:18.267 --> 01:06:19.727
whether he wrote them or not.

01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:22.396
I think the only way I'm going to find him

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.440
is to find the man
who did do the beatings.

01:06:24.523 --> 01:06:27.610
The only way I'm going to find him
is to pursue Arlyn Page

01:06:27.693 --> 01:06:31.656
and try and secure from her
some kind of identification.

01:06:33.199 --> 01:06:35.242
I'll be flying back to Pennsylvania
on Friday,

01:06:35.326 --> 01:06:36.952
and I'll fill them in on things.

01:06:37.286 --> 01:06:38.537
How is it back there?

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:42.917
I think you're homesick.
I'll be back on Thursday.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:47.797
John, I want to tell you
how much I respect your dedication.

01:06:48.214 --> 01:06:49.215
Thank you.

01:07:07.775 --> 01:07:11.404
<i>'Cause I'm very bad.
I have very wicked ideas.</i>

01:07:11.487 --> 01:07:13.489
<i>I'm sure that as you're sitting
at your great desk,</i>

01:07:13.572 --> 01:07:16.575
<i>you have all kinds of strange things
going through your mind.</i>

01:07:16.659 --> 01:07:19.036
<i>You should never be ashamed
of things like that.</i>

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.122
<i>Nothing is wrong.</i>

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:24.500
<i>Do you mind if I take my sweater off?</i>

01:07:26.001 --> 01:07:28.796
<i>I like to sort of walk around here
with no clothes on.</i>

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:31.882
<i>Better. I think people wear clothes
much too often.</i>

01:07:31.966 --> 01:07:34.719
<i>I think in the confines of one's house,
one should be</i>

01:07:35.177 --> 01:07:38.347
<i>free of clothing and inhibition.</i>

01:07:39.557 --> 01:07:43.018
<i>I think the only way that any of us
can ever be happy</i>

01:07:43.102 --> 01:07:45.730
<i>is to let it all hang out.</i>

01:07:45.813 --> 01:07:48.399
<i>Do it all and fuck it.</i>

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:37.860
I was trying to get away from...

01:10:39.653 --> 01:10:41.322
a world that I had...

01:10:42.489 --> 01:10:45.701
that I had known because
I don't think it was very good for me...

01:10:47.119 --> 01:10:48.787
and I found myself...

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:54.376
looking up its ass...

01:10:58.047 --> 01:11:02.843
and seeing people that I used to know
and that I...

01:11:08.057 --> 01:11:09.350
that I liked a lot...

01:11:15.481 --> 01:11:16.815
that were my friends...

01:11:21.779 --> 01:11:22.780
sort of...

01:11:23.739 --> 01:11:24.907
girls...

01:11:26.533 --> 01:11:27.618
and...

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.294
that could've been me.

01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:45.010
I mean, I know I'm not stupid.

01:11:49.723 --> 01:11:52.017
Ah, well, I guess I just realized that...

01:11:59.066 --> 01:12:01.026
that I don't really give a damn.

01:12:04.697 --> 01:12:10.452
<i>What I would really like to do
is be faceless and bodiless...</i>

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.542
<i>and be left alone.</i>

01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:21.338
You're lucky they're still here.

01:12:22.089 --> 01:12:26.427
We don't keep unclaimed possessions
in suicide cases more than a year.

01:12:31.724 --> 01:12:33.934
Number 497.

01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:38.772
Ah.

01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:42.317
- Yeah.
- Jane McKenna.

01:13:32.785 --> 01:13:34.119
I thought there'd be more.

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:58.936
<i>Well, there's this man that I ‒
this detective...</i>

01:14:00.104 --> 01:14:03.357
<i>and I don't know exactly what is...</i>

01:14:05.984 --> 01:14:08.695
<i>happening or what he wants out of me
or anything like that,</i>

01:14:08.779 --> 01:14:11.490
<i>but he took care of me.</i>

01:14:11.949 --> 01:14:14.409
<i>Did you feel threatened by it?</i>

01:14:17.412 --> 01:14:19.873
<i>When you're used to being lonely,
and you ‒</i>

01:14:19.957 --> 01:14:23.418
<i>somebody comes in and moves that around,
it's sort of scary, I guess.</i>

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:35.722
<i>How do you feel when you feel scary?</i>

01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:40.894
<i>Angry.</i>

01:14:40.978 --> 01:14:42.646
<i>At whom?</i>

01:14:42.729 --> 01:14:44.857
<i>Whoever it is that's
making me feel that way.</i>

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.692
<i>Do you feel angry at him?</i>

01:14:48.819 --> 01:14:49.987
<i>A lot of the time.</i>

01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:52.406
<i>How do you feel angry?
What do you want to do?</i>

01:14:54.158 --> 01:14:55.409
<i>I want to...</i>

01:15:05.085 --> 01:15:06.211
<i>manipulate him.</i>

01:15:07.004 --> 01:15:08.088
<i>How?</i>

01:15:10.924 --> 01:15:13.719
<i>In all the ways that I
can manipulate people.</i>

01:15:13.802 --> 01:15:16.305
<i>I mean, it's easy to manipulate men.
Right?</i>

01:15:45.417 --> 01:15:48.212
They were bringing a freighter
down through Kill Van Kull,

01:15:48.295 --> 01:15:49.922
propellers washed it up on top.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.844
"Arlyn Page" was probably an alias.

01:16:14.238 --> 01:16:15.906
- I'm sorry ‒
- Hey, man, can you...

01:16:16.406 --> 01:16:17.532
can you help me out?

01:16:19.785 --> 01:16:21.411
Yeah. Yeah. What?

01:16:24.164 --> 01:16:26.041
I mean, can you help me out?

01:16:31.004 --> 01:16:35.217
I mean, it's... that's my baby, dead.

01:16:39.346 --> 01:16:40.555
And I got to get up.

01:16:46.728 --> 01:16:49.398
I mean, you don't know what it means,
my baby, dead.

01:16:49.481 --> 01:16:50.816
- Got to get up.
- Yeah.

01:16:55.654 --> 01:16:56.655
Okay.

01:16:57.489 --> 01:16:58.490
Yeah.

01:17:17.676 --> 01:17:19.386
Lieutenant Trask, please.

01:17:20.012 --> 01:17:21.054
John Klute.

01:17:23.807 --> 01:17:27.477
I think we should run down a check
on everybody who knew Tom Gruneman.

01:17:27.561 --> 01:17:29.938
I don't think the man
who wrote the letters was Tom.

01:17:30.522 --> 01:17:32.733
Just run down a check on everything,
I guess.

01:17:34.151 --> 01:17:35.277
I'll talk to you.

01:17:54.504 --> 01:17:56.923
You're up, eh?

01:18:03.555 --> 01:18:04.639
How are you?

01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:08.352
Trask wants you to call him.

01:18:11.938 --> 01:18:13.273
He told me about Arlyn.

01:18:25.035 --> 01:18:27.788
It probably doesn't have anything to do
with anything...

01:18:29.498 --> 01:18:31.708
but just as a precaution...

01:18:32.793 --> 01:18:35.587
when you go out,
if you'd tell me where you're gonna go,

01:18:36.213 --> 01:18:38.507
a phone number where I can find you.

01:18:38.924 --> 01:18:41.218
Just so I can always keep in touch
with you.

01:18:42.302 --> 01:18:43.303
Okay?

01:18:44.805 --> 01:18:45.806
Sure.

01:18:54.731 --> 01:18:55.732
I'm all right.

01:18:56.358 --> 01:18:57.359
Yeah, I know.

01:19:00.695 --> 01:19:03.031
I feel physically,
that's what's different.

01:19:03.365 --> 01:19:05.534
I mean, I feel... my body feels...

01:19:05.992 --> 01:19:10.831
I enjoy... making love with him...

01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:19.631
which is a very baffling
and bewildering thing for me,

01:19:19.714 --> 01:19:21.154
because I've never felt that before.

01:19:23.051 --> 01:19:26.304
I just wish that I could let things happen

01:19:27.013 --> 01:19:31.184
and enjoy it, you know,
for what it is and while it lasts

01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:34.187
and relax about it.

01:19:36.022 --> 01:19:37.899
But all the time, all the time,

01:19:37.983 --> 01:19:40.485
I keep feeling the need to destroy it,

01:19:40.569 --> 01:19:43.530
to break it off,

01:19:44.156 --> 01:19:50.787
to go back to the comfort
of being numb again.

01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:57.461
I keep hoping, in a way,
that it's gonna end,

01:19:58.378 --> 01:20:02.841
because I had more control before
when I was with tricks.

01:20:02.924 --> 01:20:06.887
At least I knew what I was doing,
and I was setting everything up. Now I ‒

01:20:08.889 --> 01:20:12.684
And that's what's so strange,
is that I'm not setting anything up.

01:20:13.059 --> 01:20:17.022
That something is, I mean...

01:20:17.105 --> 01:20:20.192
You obviously know what this is like,
but I've never felt it before.

01:20:20.275 --> 01:20:22.486
It's a new thing, and it's so strange,

01:20:23.278 --> 01:20:25.530
the sensation that something

01:20:26.281 --> 01:20:30.160
that is flowing from me naturally
to somebody else...

01:20:32.496 --> 01:20:35.081
without its being prettied up or ‒

01:20:35.165 --> 01:20:37.292
I mean, he's seen me horrible!

01:20:37.667 --> 01:20:40.253
He's seen me ugly,

01:20:40.337 --> 01:20:44.090
he's seen me... mean,

01:20:44.174 --> 01:20:45.884
he's seen me whorey...

01:20:46.927 --> 01:20:48.595
and it doesn't seem to matter...

01:20:49.721 --> 01:20:51.473
and he seems to accept me...

01:20:55.435 --> 01:20:59.356
And I guess having sex with somebody

01:20:59.439 --> 01:21:03.693
and feeling those sort of feelings
towards them is very new to me,

01:21:03.777 --> 01:21:05.570
and I...

01:21:07.197 --> 01:21:10.033
and I wish that I didn't keep wanting
to destroy it.

01:21:15.413 --> 01:21:16.873
I'm trying to stay out of it.

01:21:21.461 --> 01:21:22.546
Yeah.

01:21:25.799 --> 01:21:27.217
You know what?

01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:30.470
I'd love to party with you, but I ‒

01:21:31.179 --> 01:21:32.222
Yeah.

01:21:33.014 --> 01:21:36.893
Well, listen, Martha,
why don't you try to get somebody else,

01:21:36.977 --> 01:21:39.312
and if I change my mind,
I'll call you, okay?

01:21:41.856 --> 01:21:42.857
Good-bye.

01:22:05.839 --> 01:22:08.174
You're not going to get hung up on me,
are you?

01:22:10.135 --> 01:22:12.971
- Yes, sir, can I help you?
- Can I have a bag, please?

01:22:13.054 --> 01:22:15.390
- A couple of bags, please.
- All right.

01:22:16.099 --> 01:22:17.100
All right.

01:22:17.559 --> 01:22:20.604
Well, yeah, let me see
how much those weigh.

01:22:21.688 --> 01:22:24.441
Okay, let me have some of those
small tomatoes.

01:22:25.317 --> 01:22:26.318
No mushy ones.

01:22:26.776 --> 01:22:28.153
Yeah, okay, thanks.

01:22:35.243 --> 01:22:37.370
- What you got in your bag?
- What?

01:22:37.454 --> 01:22:38.955
What have you got in your bag?

01:23:11.655 --> 01:23:14.366
- Can I have a cantaloupe, please?
- Cantaloupe?

01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:17.869
- How much for it?
- Dollar-50.

01:24:16.052 --> 01:24:17.053
Wait.

01:24:45.749 --> 01:24:47.250
He cut up my clo ‒

01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:50.128
Oh, my God.

01:24:51.838 --> 01:24:53.506
Oh, my God.

01:25:10.315 --> 01:25:11.316
Hello.

01:25:11.983 --> 01:25:15.403
<i>I can be a very bad girl.
I sometimes need a spanking.</i>

01:25:18.156 --> 01:25:20.617
<i>I have very wicked ideas.</i>

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.869
<i>I will do anything you ask.</i>

01:25:22.952 --> 01:25:25.371
<i>You should never be ashamed
of things like that.</i>

01:25:26.247 --> 01:25:27.874
<i>There's nothing wrong.</i>

01:25:27.957 --> 01:25:31.503
<i>I think the only way that any of us
can ever be happy</i>

01:25:31.586 --> 01:25:35.215
<i>is to let it all hang out.</i>

01:25:35.298 --> 01:25:37.842
<i>Do it all and fuck it.</i>

01:25:37.926 --> 01:25:41.429
<i>The only responsibility you have to me
is to enjoy yourself.</i>

01:25:46.184 --> 01:25:47.393
She can't remember.

01:25:48.978 --> 01:25:50.396
It could've been on a...

01:25:51.356 --> 01:25:54.025
It could've been hidden in his pocket.
I've seen one of those.

01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.490
All right, I'll wait for you here.

01:26:19.217 --> 01:26:20.218
Bree.

01:26:23.263 --> 01:26:26.683
Trask and some officers are going to come
and examine your apartment.

01:26:28.685 --> 01:26:32.730
I want you to stay here
today and tomorrow.

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.109
You'll be safe here.

01:26:36.609 --> 01:26:38.862
I'll only be gone
for a few minutes tomorrow.

01:26:57.547 --> 01:26:58.548
Bree.

01:27:05.263 --> 01:27:06.264
Bree?

01:27:11.269 --> 01:27:13.021
<i>You look like you've
been with many women,</i>

01:27:13.104 --> 01:27:15.940
<i>but I didn't know if you'd ever paid
for a woman before.</i>

01:27:16.649 --> 01:27:17.859
<i>You wouldn't need to.</i>

01:27:17.942 --> 01:27:21.446
<i>So if you do, it's because it...
obviously because it excites you.</i>

01:27:21.529 --> 01:27:23.889
<i>Because you're not a man
that would have to pay for a woman.</i>

01:27:23.948 --> 01:27:25.783
<i>You could have any woman you wanted.</i>

01:27:26.993 --> 01:27:30.538
<i>The only responsibility you have to me
is to enjoy yourself.</i>

01:27:32.624 --> 01:27:37.086
<i>You know that I will do anything you ask
or you want</i>

01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:40.548
<i>since you know that there are no limits
to my imagination,</i>

01:27:41.507 --> 01:27:43.718
<i>and I place no moral judgments
on anything.</i>

01:27:51.684 --> 01:27:55.647
We checked out 42 letters
of Tom Gruneman's friends.

01:27:55.730 --> 01:27:59.817
And we only came up with one
with any similarity to the obscene letter.

01:28:00.902 --> 01:28:02.528
All right, there's Tom Gruneman.

01:28:03.655 --> 01:28:06.991
Different margins, different spacings.

01:28:09.911 --> 01:28:13.331
That's mine.

01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:15.792
You said, "Check out everybody."

01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:19.963
Same margins, top and sides,

01:28:20.046 --> 01:28:22.548
but he does best with his middle fingers.

01:28:23.216 --> 01:28:26.594
We get fainter registrations
from outside keys.

01:28:27.053 --> 01:28:30.223
Notice how invariably he does that
with the T and the H.

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.323
Who is it?

01:28:49.033 --> 01:28:50.201
Peter Cable.

01:28:56.124 --> 01:28:59.794
But you have no case.
There's not even a body.

01:29:02.714 --> 01:29:05.299
I'm sorry we have to meet here, John,
but I'm rushed for time.

01:29:05.383 --> 01:29:07.885
I have an important business meeting
tonight in Chicago.

01:29:07.969 --> 01:29:09.053
Any developments?

01:29:10.638 --> 01:29:12.932
I think I can close the case.

01:29:14.809 --> 01:29:16.310
I think I can close the case

01:29:16.394 --> 01:29:20.481
if I can have $500 to purchase
Jane McKenna's address book.

01:29:22.817 --> 01:29:24.485
I don't understand. What do you mean?

01:29:24.569 --> 01:29:27.071
I've found a contact
who will sell me the book.

01:29:27.155 --> 01:29:31.117
A little black book containing the name
of the client that beat up Bree Daniels.

01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:35.997
He's also the man who came
into Bree Daniels' apartment yesterday

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.081
and wrecked it.

01:29:38.875 --> 01:29:42.378
We know that now because of the semen
that he left in her underwear.

01:29:42.462 --> 01:29:47.133
The blood type is AB and Tom's was type A,
so it wasn't Tom.

01:29:52.388 --> 01:29:55.391
I think this man killed Jane McKenna
and killed Arlyn Page.

01:29:55.475 --> 01:29:56.684
I think he drowned them.

01:29:58.478 --> 01:30:02.190
I think you should prepare yourself
for the fact that possibly Tom is dead.

01:30:04.734 --> 01:30:06.736
The only way I'll find out is to find him,

01:30:06.819 --> 01:30:08.654
and I need the money
before tomorrow night.

01:30:08.738 --> 01:30:10.698
- You're meeting him tomorrow night?
- Yes.

01:30:10.782 --> 01:30:12.582
He'll come to my apartment
and bring the book.

01:30:12.617 --> 01:30:13.618
At what time?

01:30:14.202 --> 01:30:15.536
About 8:30.

01:30:16.662 --> 01:30:20.333
All right, fine. I'll notify the board
as soon as I get to Chicago

01:30:20.416 --> 01:30:22.919
and have them wire you the money
immediately.

01:30:24.962 --> 01:30:29.092
Thank you, John.
I certainly hope you're wrong about Tom.

01:30:29.967 --> 01:30:31.803
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

01:31:57.763 --> 01:31:59.265
I don't want you to do this.

01:32:00.641 --> 01:32:01.642
Bree.

01:32:03.686 --> 01:32:05.813
I'm just going
to a girlfriend's apartment.

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:08.900
I can't stay here, obviously.

01:32:16.824 --> 01:32:17.909
Please.

01:32:21.204 --> 01:32:22.330
Not with him.

01:32:22.997 --> 01:32:25.750
This other girl's got
a very big apartment,

01:32:25.833 --> 01:32:26.834
lots of room.

01:32:28.002 --> 01:32:29.921
It's not necessarily how it looks.

01:32:31.923 --> 01:32:35.551
Look, we all respect each other, right?

01:32:36.636 --> 01:32:37.970
I respect you.

01:32:40.139 --> 01:32:41.390
Bree respects you.

01:32:42.183 --> 01:32:44.185
But you gotta respect her too.

01:32:46.896 --> 01:32:48.064
Her best interests.

01:34:34.378 --> 01:34:37.006
Mrs. Daniels, I have to close up now.

01:34:37.089 --> 01:34:38.809
Leave your name and number
with the service.

01:34:38.841 --> 01:34:41.802
I'm sure she'll get back to you
as soon as she has a chance.

01:34:41.886 --> 01:34:42.887
I can't.

01:34:43.471 --> 01:34:45.806
Well, I have to close up now.

01:34:50.227 --> 01:34:51.645
I almost killed somebody.

01:34:52.355 --> 01:34:55.358
I'm certain the doctor would
like to speak with you about it.

01:34:55.441 --> 01:34:58.569
I'll have her call you
as soon as she gets home, I promise.

01:35:01.822 --> 01:35:03.157
Can I use your phone?

01:35:03.783 --> 01:35:04.784
Sure.

01:35:10.748 --> 01:35:13.751
Is Mr. Goldfarb there?
Mr. Goldfarb Senior.

01:35:18.422 --> 01:35:19.924
I've got to talk to somebody.

01:35:20.299 --> 01:35:22.635
I'm just a little way across town.
Can I come over?

01:35:22.718 --> 01:35:25.930
About half an hour?

01:35:27.139 --> 01:35:29.058
Uh-huh.

01:35:35.981 --> 01:35:37.400
Detective Trask, please.

01:35:40.069 --> 01:35:41.112
Hi. John Klute.

01:35:42.279 --> 01:35:44.407
He didn't take the plane, he canceled out.

01:35:46.117 --> 01:35:47.618
I'm at home in my apartment.

01:35:48.327 --> 01:35:50.454
I don't know where she is.
She's left. I'll find her.

01:35:52.206 --> 01:35:54.458
<i>Okay. Well, I'll leave word if I go out.</i>

01:35:54.542 --> 01:35:55.584
<i>Okay.</i>

01:36:21.152 --> 01:36:22.903
I have an appointment with Mr. Goldfarb.

01:36:24.321 --> 01:36:25.865
Mr. Goldfarb!

01:36:27.324 --> 01:36:29.160
Mr. Goldfarb!

01:36:32.746 --> 01:36:34.498
Hello. What can I do for you?

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.252
I'm sorry. I mean Mr. Goldfarb Senior.

01:36:38.335 --> 01:36:41.464
My father left about 15 minutes ago.
He didn't feel so good.

01:36:41.922 --> 01:36:45.342
- Can I help you?
- He's working himself to death, poor man.

01:36:45.759 --> 01:36:48.179
- You sure I can't help you?
- It's not important.

01:36:48.262 --> 01:36:49.847
No, really, I don't mind.

01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:52.766
You're gonna miss your train,
Mr. Goldfarb.

01:36:53.893 --> 01:36:55.060
Excuse me.

01:36:55.978 --> 01:36:58.230
Did he leave a message for me,
Bree Daniels?

01:36:58.647 --> 01:37:01.984
Oh! I thought that was for tomorrow.

01:37:15.331 --> 01:37:17.082
Mr. Goldfarb's wire.

01:37:19.168 --> 01:37:22.046
Oh, yes, Mama, I'm coming right now.

01:37:22.129 --> 01:37:25.257
I know you don't like to get in
in the middle of the picture.

01:37:25.591 --> 01:37:27.760
Yes, right away. Bye-bye.

01:37:34.308 --> 01:37:35.935
We're closing now, miss.

01:37:36.852 --> 01:37:38.604
May I leave Mr. Goldfarb a message?

01:37:38.687 --> 01:37:41.273
Poor man, everybody's friend.

01:39:10.237 --> 01:39:11.280
Hello?

01:39:12.615 --> 01:39:13.616
Hello?

01:39:15.034 --> 01:39:18.329
This is Bree Daniels.
Has the doctor checked in yet?

01:39:18.746 --> 01:39:23.375
When she does,
would you tell her I'm at 246-1383?

01:39:23.709 --> 01:39:25.794
And I'll wait here about five minutes.

01:40:56.802 --> 01:40:59.054
Can you tell me how I can
get in touch with the doctor?

01:40:59.138 --> 01:41:00.889
<i>Doctor hasn't checked in yet.</i>

01:41:00.973 --> 01:41:03.100
I'm trying to locate a Miss Bree Daniels.

01:41:03.183 --> 01:41:06.395
<i>Bree? I'm sorry, sir,
but we only take messages for the doctor.</i>

01:41:07.354 --> 01:41:10.816
Has she called in or anything?
Has she called the doctor at all today?

01:41:10.899 --> 01:41:13.193
<i>I believe Miss Daniels did leave
a forwarding number.</i>

01:41:13.277 --> 01:41:16.196
- Can you give me that number?
<i>- We can't give out that information.</i>

01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.991
I'm a police officer.
Don't make me prove this. It's important.

01:41:19.074 --> 01:41:22.661
<i>Sorry. You must understand my position.
I must comply with the rules.</i>

01:41:22.745 --> 01:41:26.623
Yeah, I understand all that.
Will you just give me the number, please?

01:41:36.258 --> 01:41:38.135
Can we talk about this reasonably?

01:41:39.762 --> 01:41:43.140
I know you're expecting
some kind of extravagant behavior, but...

01:41:45.642 --> 01:41:46.685
Do you believe me?

01:41:47.478 --> 01:41:48.479
Yes.

01:41:49.563 --> 01:41:50.564
We can talk?

01:41:57.321 --> 01:41:59.907
Well, it's just an ordinary matter.

01:42:01.992 --> 01:42:03.368
I'm a very well-off man.

01:42:03.452 --> 01:42:06.580
I have a position to respect.

01:42:08.248 --> 01:42:11.084
And I would feel, personally,
very uncomfortable

01:42:11.168 --> 01:42:16.507
to be... connected
with a certain kind of woman.

01:42:16.590 --> 01:42:18.425
I'm sure you understand what I mean.

01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:25.474
Look, John Klute works for me.

01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:30.020
I know you're his contact.

01:42:31.855 --> 01:42:36.401
And I know he's trying to acquire
Jane McKenna's book.

01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:44.117
I'm in a position to offer more for it
than he can.

01:42:50.999 --> 01:42:53.252
You don't understand
what I'm talking about, do you?

01:42:54.044 --> 01:42:57.214
Yes, Jane McKenna's book.
And I'll try to get it for you.

01:42:57.673 --> 01:43:01.885
No. Obviously you're frightened
and you're lying.

01:43:03.887 --> 01:43:06.849
No, I'm not.
I will. I'll try to get it for you.

01:43:08.892 --> 01:43:13.230
Is this something Klute's invented?

01:43:14.815 --> 01:43:16.483
Is this a trap for me?

01:43:17.526 --> 01:43:19.194
Klute knows about me, doesn't he?

01:43:20.153 --> 01:43:21.363
Knows what about you?

01:43:24.491 --> 01:43:26.201
Then everybody knows about me.

01:43:28.328 --> 01:43:30.956
So it doesn't make any difference
what I do anymore, does it?

01:44:06.033 --> 01:44:08.160
I have no idea what I'm going to do.

01:44:10.954 --> 01:44:12.748
And I'm so deeply puzzled.

01:44:15.167 --> 01:44:18.462
I've done terrible things.
I've killed three people.

01:44:21.298 --> 01:44:23.842
But yet I don't consider myself
a terrible man.

01:44:25.594 --> 01:44:28.555
No more than others.

01:44:30.182 --> 01:44:31.975
See, Tom Gruneman discovered me.

01:44:32.059 --> 01:44:33.852
We were here on business together,

01:44:34.561 --> 01:44:38.065
and he found me and Jane McKenna
in my hotel room.

01:44:41.401 --> 01:44:46.198
She had become hysterical,
and she started screaming,

01:44:46.281 --> 01:44:48.659
and I guess I hit her.

01:44:48.742 --> 01:44:52.204
I don't actually recall,
it all happened so quickly.

01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:57.960
Anyway, she fell and hit her head,
and that's when Tom came in the room.

01:44:58.043 --> 01:45:00.796
I guess he must've heard her screaming.

01:45:03.131 --> 01:45:06.385
But I never understood really
why she did that.

01:45:06.468 --> 01:45:08.470
She had never screamed before.

01:45:12.391 --> 01:45:15.310
And it was the revulsion

01:45:15.394 --> 01:45:18.981
and the contempt that I saw on his face...

01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:23.068
and the certainty that sooner or later

01:45:23.151 --> 01:45:25.862
he would use it against me,
within the company.

01:45:27.781 --> 01:45:33.870
And I tried to endure that
as long as I possibly could, you see?

01:45:40.252 --> 01:45:42.587
You just want me to keep on talking,
don't you?

01:45:43.588 --> 01:45:45.924
No, I don't. I do understand. I really do.

01:45:46.675 --> 01:45:48.218
Well, that's what you all do.

01:45:49.761 --> 01:45:53.390
You make a man think that he's accepted.

01:45:55.726 --> 01:45:57.853
It's all just a great big game to you.

01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:03.692
And you're all obviously too lazy
and too warped

01:46:03.775 --> 01:46:05.902
to do anything meaningful with your lives,

01:46:05.986 --> 01:46:10.115
so you prey upon the sexual fantasies
of others.

01:46:13.035 --> 01:46:15.954
I'm sure it comes
as no great surprise to you when I say...

01:46:17.581 --> 01:46:20.709
that there are little corners
in everyone...

01:46:22.127 --> 01:46:24.129
which were better off left alone.

01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:31.553
Little sicknesses, weaknesses,
which should never be exposed.

01:46:34.056 --> 01:46:37.893
But that's your stock-in-trade, isn't it,
a man's weakness?

01:46:41.813 --> 01:46:44.399
And I was never really fully aware
of mine...

01:46:45.525 --> 01:46:47.152
until you brought them out.

01:47:12.469 --> 01:47:14.262
<i>How far out of town are we?</i>

01:47:16.181 --> 01:47:19.726
<i>About five miles
outside of New York.</i>

01:47:19.810 --> 01:47:23.563
<i>Do you mind if I
turn the lights down?</i>

01:47:23.647 --> 01:47:26.274
<i>No, it's up to you.
Turn the light out if you'd like.</i>

01:47:29.986 --> 01:47:31.571
<i>My name is Peter Cable.</i>

01:47:32.614 --> 01:47:35.117
<i>I work for the Tole American Corporation,</i>

01:47:35.909 --> 01:47:39.121
<i>which is situated in Pennsylvania
and in New York.</i>

01:47:40.205 --> 01:47:42.707
<i>Obviously, I would not
be telling you these things</i>

01:47:43.458 --> 01:47:46.086
<i>if my intentions weren't honorable.</i>

01:47:47.170 --> 01:47:51.424
<i>Oh. You look familiar to me.</i>

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:52.968
<i>In what way?</i>

01:47:53.927 --> 01:47:56.346
<i>I don't know.
Your face looks familiar to me.</i>

01:47:58.557 --> 01:48:00.767
<i>I guess I have a confession to make.</i>

01:48:00.851 --> 01:48:04.146
<i>We did meet before. About two years ago.</i>

01:48:05.230 --> 01:48:09.693
<i>And I often wondered whatever happened
to Arlyn Page, and here you are.</i>

01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:13.321
<i>Yeah, I remember.</i>

01:48:15.991 --> 01:48:20.287
<i>Listen, I've got to get out of here.
I mean, I can't...</i>

01:48:20.745 --> 01:48:22.080
<i>What's the matter?</i>

01:48:22.956 --> 01:48:25.041
<i>- I remember you.
- What do you remember?</i>

01:48:25.125 --> 01:48:27.252
<i>You beat me up,
that's what you did!</i>

01:48:29.546 --> 01:48:33.800
<i>It's okay. Just freaked me out
for a minute, that's all.</i>

01:48:34.968 --> 01:48:38.138
<i>I promise to drive you back afterwards.</i>

01:48:38.471 --> 01:48:42.017
<i>Okay. Why don't you just
tell me what you'd like,</i>

01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:44.644
<i>and then after you tell me
what you'd like ‒</i>

01:48:44.728 --> 01:48:47.105
<i>I'd like to spend just
some time with you.</i>

01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:49.566
<i>I have been looking for you for two years.</i>

01:48:50.025 --> 01:48:51.067
<i>Why?</i>

01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:55.572
<i>That's my business.</i>

01:48:58.783 --> 01:49:01.620
<i>I will say that you gave me
a great deal of pleasure.</i>

01:49:01.703 --> 01:49:07.125
<i>I saw in you things that I had not seen
in other women of your profession.</i>

01:49:08.001 --> 01:49:10.420
<i>I will not harm you at all physically.</i>

01:49:11.379 --> 01:49:13.715
<i>- It's all right.
- No, it's not all right.</i>

01:49:13.798 --> 01:49:15.425
<i>Of course you know it's not all right.</i>

01:49:15.508 --> 01:49:19.095
<i>No, it is all right.
But you have to tell me first, and then...</i>

01:49:20.263 --> 01:49:23.808
<i>And if that's what you want, that's fine.</i>

01:49:23.892 --> 01:49:27.938
<i>Arlyn, why don't you lie down on the
bed and make yourself comfortable?</i>

01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:32.400
<i>I'll not strap you in or tie you down.
Just lie down on the bed, please.</i>

01:49:36.404 --> 01:49:38.740
<i>Be comfortable. Nothing's going to happen.</i>

01:49:45.413 --> 01:49:46.915
<i>Nothing's going to happen.</i>

01:49:49.876 --> 01:49:51.044
<i>Okay.</i>

01:49:51.503 --> 01:49:56.007
<i>Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
Why don't you take your clo ‒</i>

01:49:56.091 --> 01:49:57.926
<i>I am perfectly comfortable.</i>

01:49:58.343 --> 01:49:59.552
<i>Just put your head down.</i>

01:50:02.555 --> 01:50:05.892
<i>You have such lovely long blonde hair.</i>

01:50:07.811 --> 01:50:09.688
<i>- Hmm.
- Turn your head.</i>

01:50:11.773 --> 01:50:12.774
<i>Like that.</i>

01:50:14.109 --> 01:50:17.612
<i>No! No!</i>

01:50:35.338 --> 01:50:36.548
<i>Oh.</i>

01:51:44.491 --> 01:51:46.868
<i>I've explained to him what I have to do,</i>

01:51:46.951 --> 01:51:49.704
<i>and I think he understands.</i>

01:51:50.413 --> 01:51:53.625
<i>What could ever happen for us?
We're so different...</i>

01:51:54.376 --> 01:51:58.046
<i>I know enough about myself to know that
whatever lies in store for me,</i>

01:51:58.129 --> 01:52:02.801
<i>it's not gonna be setting up housekeeping
with somebody in Tuscarora,</i>

01:52:02.884 --> 01:52:04.594
<i>and darning socks and doing all that.</i>

01:52:04.677 --> 01:52:07.180
<i>I mean, that's just...
I'd go out of my mind.</i>

01:52:21.069 --> 01:52:24.697
<i>I don't know how I feel about him. I...</i>

01:52:26.032 --> 01:52:29.411
<i>- It's so hard for me to say it! God!
- To say what?</i>

01:52:29.494 --> 01:52:31.037
<i>I'm going to miss him.</i>

01:52:46.719 --> 01:52:47.929
Bree Daniels.

01:52:53.184 --> 01:52:54.352
How is Roy?

01:53:02.152 --> 01:53:05.488
Well, I'm leaving town right now,
and I don't expect to be back.

01:53:06.906 --> 01:53:08.199
You're very nice.

01:53:09.409 --> 01:53:11.536
Thank you. Good-bye.

01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:29.220
<i>I have no idea what's going to happen.</i>

01:53:29.846 --> 01:53:32.432
<i>I just... I can't stay in the city.</i>

01:53:34.392 --> 01:53:35.560
<i>Maybe I'll come back.</i>

01:53:37.687 --> 01:53:39.856
<i>You'll probably see me next week.</i>
