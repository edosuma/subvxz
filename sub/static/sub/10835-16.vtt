00:01.794 --> 00:03.295
Previously on 90210...

00:03.420 --> 00:05.422
Ms. Silver, I am transferring
you out of this class.

00:05.547 --> 00:07.299
Mr. Matthews,
what is this about?

00:07.424 --> 00:09.426
You calling me a child-molesting
pervert on your blog,

00:09.551 --> 00:10.719
and almost costing me my job.

00:10.845 --> 00:12.095
Did you see what she wrote?

00:12.220 --> 00:13.430
She got carried away.
She's a kid.

00:13.555 --> 00:16.433
So... I'm back
in your class?
Yeah.

00:16.558 --> 00:17.434
Hey, Naomi.
See, that's
not fair.

00:17.559 --> 00:18.602
You know my name,

00:18.727 --> 00:19.687
but I don't know yours.

00:19.812 --> 00:20.771
Liam.

00:20.896 --> 00:22.272
What if you send him a bottle

00:22.397 --> 00:24.399
of champagne, telling him
to meet you by the pool?

00:24.525 --> 00:26.443
I just knew that I wanted
to stop thinking,

00:26.568 --> 00:28.362
so I took all my mom's
sleeping pills.

00:28.487 --> 00:30.698
Annie, tell us a
story of your life.

00:30.823 --> 00:32.950
Something really painful.

00:33.074 --> 00:37.120
I took these sleeping pills
from my mom's medicine cabinet.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.455
ETHAN:
It wasn't a story.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.414
It's her life.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.666
ANNIE (sobbing):
I know

00:40.791 --> 00:42.125
what I did was wrong,

00:42.250 --> 00:43.794
and I'm ashamed of myself.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.380
I love you,
and I want to be with you.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.382
I wanted to get something
permanent to symbolize our love.

00:48.507 --> 00:50.342
HARRY:
I want to introduce you

00:50.467 --> 00:52.636
to a student that's going
to be joining your class.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.304
You're in high school?
My mom had to sign

00:54.429 --> 00:55.723
for that bottle
of champagne you sent over,

00:55.848 --> 00:57.098
which sort of tipped her off

00:57.224 --> 00:59.142
that I wasn't enrolled here.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.567
Hey.

01:06.692 --> 01:08.610
Can we talk?

01:08.736 --> 01:10.738
Look, I'm sorry I sent the
champagne to your house.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.573
I didn't mean
to get you in trouble.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.575
I thought you lived alone.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.660
Whatever. It doesn't matter
anyway. I just...

01:16.785 --> 01:19.454
It was a really stupid
thing to do, and I'm sorry.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.790
Can we start over?

01:21.916 --> 01:23.834
Hi.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.961
I'm Naomi.

01:29.297 --> 01:30.758
(gasps)

01:30.883 --> 01:32.509
Hi, Naomi.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.636
(moaning)

01:36.346 --> 01:38.348
♪ ♪

01:38.473 --> 01:39.558
(phone ringing)

01:45.522 --> 01:48.316
Turn off your cell phone.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.695
Oh!

01:56.324 --> 01:57.367
(both laughing)

01:57.492 --> 01:58.452
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:58.577 --> 01:59.870
Turn it off.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.209
(both moaning)

02:10.589 --> 02:12.800
(laughing)

02:12.925 --> 02:14.593
(Naomi's laughter echoing)

02:14.718 --> 02:16.511
(phone ringing)

02:17.554 --> 02:19.389
(panting)

02:19.514 --> 02:20.724
Hello?

02:20.849 --> 02:21.892
MAN:
Good morning, Ms. Clark.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.393
It's 7:30.

02:23.518 --> 02:24.770
Um, yeah, I know.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.438
I'm-I'm up. I'm up.

02:26.563 --> 02:27.481
I'm wide awake.

02:27.606 --> 02:28.607
Thank you.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.943
Bye.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.155
(laughing)

02:44.665 --> 02:47.208
(Dixon sighs)

02:47.334 --> 02:48.376
(sighs)

02:48.502 --> 02:50.337
Right shoe.
Where's my left shoe?

02:50.462 --> 02:51.880
I can't find my left shoe.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.090
Where is it?
Would you relax?

02:53.214 --> 02:55.509
I can't relax. We just had sex
in the media room.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.218
I know. I was there.
And if somebody
would have walked in...

02:57.344 --> 02:58.637
They would be jealous
or impressed.

02:58.762 --> 02:59.805
Perhaps titillated, in the case

02:59.930 --> 03:01.682
of that pervy janitor
with the lazy eye.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.601
Well, the pervy janitor's gonna
have to get his kicks elsewhere.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.561
I'm the principal's son.
I can't get caught like this.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.896
So, media room.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.940
Much better than under
the bleachers, but not as good

03:10.065 --> 03:11.441
as the cafeteria. Where
do you want to try next?

03:11.566 --> 03:13.276
Someplace really freaky.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.278
I got one.
Talk to me, baby.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.613
How about a bed?

03:16.738 --> 03:18.866
A bed? In a
furniture store?
No.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.617
Oh, a tanning bed?
Mm-mm.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.743
(gasps)
A bed of roses.

03:21.869 --> 03:22.703
Huntington Gardens!

03:22.828 --> 03:23.954
I love that idea!

03:24.079 --> 03:25.288
Come on. Would
you stop that?!

03:25.413 --> 03:26.874
(clattering)
(gasping)

03:26.999 --> 03:28.625
(laughing)

03:28.750 --> 03:30.335
Come on, don't
do that to me.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.675
So, um... so I have a-a hunch

03:36.800 --> 03:39.803
that Mrs. Winters is going
to give us a pop quiz today.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.013
When-Whenever it rains,

03:41.138 --> 03:43.223
the next day,
she gives us a pop quiz.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.392
Maybe, uh, humidity
makes her vengeful, or...

03:45.517 --> 03:46.977
Hey, can you, uh, wait up?

03:47.102 --> 03:48.520
Your legs are longer
than mine.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.563
It's not fair.

03:49.688 --> 03:50.981
Oh. Sorry.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.649
Ethan, is this ever
going to end?

03:52.774 --> 03:54.151
What?
This.

03:54.275 --> 03:57.654
This-- you being
mad at me, and me

03:57.779 --> 04:00.281
apologizing over
and over and over again.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.576
You can stop apologizing.
I hear you.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.912
Then what? What is it?

04:05.037 --> 04:06.329
I don't know.

04:06.454 --> 04:07.789
I just feel like...
I don't know.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.332
Like I don't know you.

04:09.457 --> 04:12.335
Because of this one thing?

04:12.460 --> 04:14.838
Because I told Rhonda's story?

04:14.963 --> 04:16.714
When I was watching you
tell her story,

04:16.839 --> 04:18.298
I was horrified,

04:18.425 --> 04:21.344
but I was also impressed.

04:21.469 --> 04:24.305
You are a very good actress,
Annie.

04:26.058 --> 04:29.144
I had no idea who you were.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.355
And that makes me
wonder who we are.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.277
So, try to think
about these poems

04:37.402 --> 04:40.655
in terms of positive
and negative space.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.699
The positive space is the, um...

04:42.824 --> 04:44.118
It's the words.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.994
And the negative space
is the meaning

04:46.120 --> 04:47.621
that we impose on those words.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.874
You know, rarely does a poem
just, you know, come right out

04:50.999 --> 04:52.459
and-and say something
straightforward.

04:52.584 --> 04:53.794
No kidding.
That's the problem.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.712
Not the problem.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.048
It's the beauty.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.634
You know, it's up to
us to interpret poems,

05:00.759 --> 05:03.553
to-to understand them,
to make them valid.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.973
So, please, I...
yeah, I beg you,

05:06.098 --> 05:07.599
don't let your poems down.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.226
(school bell rings)

05:09.350 --> 05:12.187
And not that any
of you would wait

05:12.312 --> 05:15.065
till the last minute, but,
uh, just a friendly reminder.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.692
Your poetry presentations
do begin tomorrow.

05:17.818 --> 05:21.529
I got to say, I'm loving
this assignment, Matthews.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.990
When did we lose
the Mister?

05:23.115 --> 05:25.617
Do I not command respect?

05:25.742 --> 05:29.037
This poem that you assigned me--
I absolutely love it.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.914
Oh, shout out to Lord Byron.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.415
But I'll be straight with you.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.209
I've never really liked
love poems before.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.962
You know, they're so, like,
over-the-top and-and grandiose,

05:37.087 --> 05:39.422
or sappy, or just full of crap.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.591
You know?
I'll take that
as a metaphor.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.426
I never really got them,
you know?

05:43.551 --> 05:46.513
It's, like,
"My love is like a rose."

05:46.638 --> 05:48.932
"Your eyes are like
a filthy swimming pool."

05:49.057 --> 05:50.391
I'm not familiar
with that one.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.559
Poetry was this

05:51.685 --> 05:53.061
foreign language to me, okay?

05:53.187 --> 05:55.230
But now, I get it.

05:55.396 --> 05:58.608
And I don't know if it's because
I actually know what love is,

05:58.733 --> 06:00.110
or because you somehow

06:00.235 --> 06:02.029
broke through this thick skull
of mine,

06:02.154 --> 06:03.530
but suddenly, these poems...

06:03.655 --> 06:05.949
It's, like,
they're not gibberish anymore.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.576
Love is like a rose.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.619
It is.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.079
(laughs)

06:11.205 --> 06:12.914
Ms. Silver, I do believe
you're inspired.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.917
Yeah, I also believe you could
lay off the coffee a little bit.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.627
Okay, I wanted
to check with you.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.880
I want to show a film
as my presentation.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.049
I've been working on it,
and I'm fairly sure

06:22.174 --> 06:23.300
it's going to blow your mind.

06:23.424 --> 06:24.634
Sounds good. I take it
you're familiar

06:24.759 --> 06:26.094
with all the equipment
in the media lab?

06:26.220 --> 06:29.472
You have no idea how familiar
I am with that equipment.

06:30.891 --> 06:31.933
(soft laugh)

06:36.813 --> 06:40.067
SINTON:
What formula would you use
to find the volume, hmm?

06:40.192 --> 06:42.652
Mr. Court. So glad
you've decided

06:42.777 --> 06:43.987
to join us.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.656
Would you like to tell us
what formula you would use

06:46.781 --> 06:48.658
to find the volume of
a triangular prism?

06:48.783 --> 06:50.035
No idea.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.162
Okay. It's one-
half times

06:52.287 --> 06:54.915
length times width
times height.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.083
That ring a bell?

06:56.208 --> 06:57.834
Nope.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.712
Well, where did you leave off
in your last math class?

07:00.837 --> 07:03.131
Do you know how to figure out
the area of a rectangle?

07:03.257 --> 07:05.592
How to classify
triangles?

07:05.717 --> 07:08.095
Okay, well,
it looks like

07:08.220 --> 07:09.930
you have to play
a little catch-up.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.140
Who would like
to go over past exams with Liam?

07:12.266 --> 07:14.142
For extra credit, of course.

07:14.268 --> 07:15.769
You?

07:15.894 --> 07:18.897
Um... yeah.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.482
I could really use
the extra credit.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.026
Okay.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.182
What kind of guy
drops out of high school

07:54.308 --> 07:55.725
to work as a bartender?

07:55.850 --> 07:58.353
I mean, what kind of guy
barely speaks to you

07:58.478 --> 08:00.981
before he throws you up
against a wall and starts to...

08:01.106 --> 08:02.857
Show you the banana
in his pants?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.234
Yeah, that was a dream.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.693
I know that, okay?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.821
I don't have a
lot to work with.

08:07.946 --> 08:08.989
He's a complete enigma.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.698
Well, you know what they say.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.576
The way to a man's heart
is through math.

08:13.701 --> 08:14.911
Hey.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.579
What was I
supposed to do?

08:16.704 --> 08:18.457
I have to get him to forgive me.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.209
I mean, if it was Ethan,
I'd just give him pot stickers.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.086
Those always put him
in a good mood.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.963
God, but I don't know anything
about Liam.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.840
I mean, I don't know
where he stands

08:26.965 --> 08:28.258
on the whole
pot sticker spectrum.

08:28.383 --> 08:31.011
Okay, well, putting a pin
in the pot sticker issue...

08:31.136 --> 08:32.095
did you Google him?

08:32.220 --> 08:33.929
Um, hi. Of course I did.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.015
He has no digital footprints.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.183
No My Space,

08:36.308 --> 08:37.767
no Facebook.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.644
Well, how does he
SuperPoke people?

08:39.769 --> 08:42.022
(sighs)
He's a complete mystery.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.857
Josh in my history class says
he's in a gang.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.233
No, no, no, no, no.
That doesn't seem right at all.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.860
He's a complete loner.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.362
And I definitely couldn't
see him wearing a doo rag.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.947
Did you hear about
the cooking meth rumor?

08:51.072 --> 08:52.199
Yeah, from Sally.

08:52.324 --> 08:54.951
She also said she went on a date
with Rob Pattinson.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.995
Yeah, she's clearly full of it.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.538
Hopefully, I'll find out
some real information

08:58.663 --> 09:01.041
from him today during
the tutoring session.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.709
Yeah, not this afternoon,
you won't.

09:02.834 --> 09:06.004
Your enigma
is driving away.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.006
(engine starting)

09:08.131 --> 09:10.675
(tires squealing)

09:16.181 --> 09:17.849
(laughing)

09:22.603 --> 09:25.065
Hey, Spielberg,
I got to get through.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.274
(sighs)

09:26.400 --> 09:27.734
Enjoy.

09:27.859 --> 09:30.028
Here. Look at me.
Look at me.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.907
(squealing)

09:34.032 --> 09:34.991
And... got it.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.034
Now I'm dizzy.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.327
(both laughing)

09:37.452 --> 09:39.329
So, what was that shot for?

09:39.454 --> 09:40.830
Okay, that's a shot

09:40.955 --> 09:43.041
when the heroine experiences
love for the first time,

09:43.166 --> 09:45.126
you know, and her entire world
just starts spinning.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.753
That's pretty cool.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.171
Far be it from me
to toot my own horn, but...

09:48.296 --> 09:49.923
By all means. Toot away.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.299
(laughing)

09:52.300 --> 09:55.262
Dixon, it's crazy.

09:55.387 --> 09:59.099
The moment that I decided
to do the poem as a film,

09:59.224 --> 10:01.309
this whole entire concept
just came to me.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.352
Scene by scene

10:02.477 --> 10:04.271
and shot by shot,

10:04.396 --> 10:06.440
I knew exactly what I
wanted to do, you know?

10:06.565 --> 10:08.149
I can't wait for you to see it.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.359
What's next?

10:09.484 --> 10:12.237
Uh, well, I do need to refuel.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.738
So, what can I get you?

10:13.863 --> 10:17.033
How about...

10:17.158 --> 10:20.579
an order of Dixon?
Dressing on the side?

10:20.703 --> 10:23.373
Hey, you and me in the
storage room, right now.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.375
I'm working.
Yeah.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.751
You work in a
service industry, right?

10:28.920 --> 10:30.922
All right, you know,
I gotta go on break

10:31.047 --> 10:32.048
in a minute, so...
Okay!

10:38.888 --> 10:40.848
You don't think this is
too big for the kitchen?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.350
No.

10:42.476 --> 10:45.312
(grunting)

10:45.437 --> 10:48.022
Did I ever tell you that you
are the love of my life?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.732
I think the last time
was when I was carrying

10:49.857 --> 10:52.152
a gigantic teak
bookshelf up the stairs.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.028
What can I say?

10:54.154 --> 10:56.823
Seeing you carry heavy objects
reminds me how much I love you.

10:56.948 --> 10:57.991
(giggling)
That plant

10:58.116 --> 10:59.993
is too big for the kitchen.
DEBBIE:
Annie!

11:00.118 --> 11:01.411
What are you doing home?

11:01.536 --> 11:03.955
You're supposed to be
at rehearsal.
I... I quit.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.207
What?

11:06.333 --> 11:07.542
Why would you quit?

11:07.667 --> 11:11.171
You know, it was
such a small part.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.589
It really wasn't worth my time.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.508
Well, come on,
what is it they say?

11:14.633 --> 11:17.344
There are no small parts,
just small actors.

11:17.469 --> 11:19.346
Yeah, well, whoever
said that got the lead.

11:19.471 --> 11:22.098
Besides, I'm not sure that

11:22.223 --> 11:24.851
being in the play is
good for me and Ethan, so...

11:24.976 --> 11:26.353
What do you mean?

11:26.478 --> 11:28.771
It's not a big deal, okay?

11:28.896 --> 11:31.065
There will be other plays.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.568
And I just need to focus on my
relationship right now.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.865
Do something.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.825
What do you want me to do?
Tackle her and force

11:40.950 --> 11:42.327
her to go to rehearsal?
I don't know.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.496
But she should be
focusing on herself

11:44.621 --> 11:45.872
and-and what's important to her

11:45.997 --> 11:47.290
and not making decisions
based on some boy.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.500
I agree.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.835
Well, then, let's do something.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.963
Ground her or forbid her
from seeing Ethan.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.840
Honey, really?

11:55.965 --> 11:58.134
No! Yes.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.302
I don't, I don't know.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.512
And don't "honey" me.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.847
She is making
a huge mistake.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.850
And you are refusing
to do anything about it.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.061
And that plant is way
too big for the kitchen.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.442
(pounding rock music plays)

12:14.568 --> 12:16.903
(typing)

12:25.036 --> 12:26.246
Hey.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.497
Geez, Matthews, you scared me.

12:27.622 --> 12:28.831
Sorry about that.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.458
Uh, I'm just taking
off for the night.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.834
I wanted to see
how you're doing.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.295
I-I'm great, actually.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.464
This project has made me realize
that I want to be a filmmaker.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.216
I'm going to make movies.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.594
Wow, that's cool.

12:40.719 --> 12:43.054
You know, I gotta say,
I like movies better than blogs.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.264
It totally makes sense.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.891
I... I've always been
a visual person,

12:47.016 --> 12:49.269
it's just, I'm crap
at painting and drawing.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.521
So, film is this
perfect medium for me.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.440
You know, I don't
have to create the image,

12:53.565 --> 12:55.942
I just have to capture it
and then connect them.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.444
Well, just thank me
at the Oscars.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.028
You got it.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.405
So, look...

13:00.530 --> 13:02.532
I know everybody gets ten
minutes for their presentation,

13:02.657 --> 13:04.325
but I can't cut it down to that.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.411
I mean, maybe if I make
some really big trims

13:06.536 --> 13:08.204
I can get it down
to 45 minutes.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.289
What do you think?

13:09.414 --> 13:10.540
Are you out of your mind?

13:10.665 --> 13:12.959
Aim for ten.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.711
All right? We have other
students in the class.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.546
You just lost your
Oscar shout out.

13:16.671 --> 13:19.048
Well, I'll survive.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.801
(sighs)

13:31.519 --> 13:33.354
(sighs)

13:35.607 --> 13:36.566
Oh, good, you're awake.

13:36.691 --> 13:37.984
Silver, what are you doing here?

13:38.109 --> 13:39.402
Morning, baby.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.613
I'm gonna rock
your world.

13:47.285 --> 13:48.286
Wait, uh...

13:48.411 --> 13:49.454
Ooh, hey...

13:49.579 --> 13:50.538
Um, what are you doing?

13:50.664 --> 13:52.206
What do you think?

13:52.332 --> 13:54.167
I don't know.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.127
Wait, you wanna have sex? Here?

13:56.252 --> 13:58.463
You're the one who
wanted to do it in a bed.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.341
Yeah, but my parents are
right down the hall sleeping.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.636
That's funny,
I didn't sleep a wink.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.346
(gasping):
Oh! But I finished my movie.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.181
And baby...
it's a masterpiece.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.975
Wow, cool.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.394
Now, I'm ready to celebrate.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.062
Whoa, hey, Silver.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.397
Uh, take it easy.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.316
My movie, it's all about love!

14:18.441 --> 14:19.984
And you are my inspiration.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.737
Um, well, um, let me
inspire you later, cool?

14:22.862 --> 14:25.906
Dixon, you are gonna freak out
when you see my film.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.159
I mean, of course I ran
into a little glitch

14:28.284 --> 14:30.370
'cause Matthews is insisting
on the under-ten-minute thing.

14:30.495 --> 14:33.581
But then I realized, it's gonna
be wasted on a classroom anyway.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.125
So, I'm gonna rent a theater!

14:36.250 --> 14:37.836
A-Are you kidding?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.421
I mean, it's a little
bit expensive, but it's
a huge investment

14:40.547 --> 14:42.423
for my future and you're gonna
come to the screening, right?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.509
Um, yeah, yeah, um,

14:44.634 --> 14:47.721
long as my parents
don't find you in here.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.723
'Cause dead people can't
go to screenings, you know.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.265
You are so cute
when you're nervous.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.519
I'm much much, much less cute
if I'm dead, trust me.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.354
That's fine, fine.
I wonder if Scorsese

14:56.479 --> 14:58.398
has such a hard time
getting morning action.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.441
(chuckling nervously):
Yeah.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.610
(Silver squealing)

15:02.736 --> 15:03.944
It's gonna be amazing! Love you!

15:04.070 --> 15:06.155
I love you, too.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.990
(sighing)

15:08.115 --> 15:09.534
Come on, come on.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.118
You will give me coffee.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.746
Morning, Dad.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.497
When the machines
finally wage war

15:14.622 --> 15:16.374
against their human oppressors

15:16.499 --> 15:18.376
do you think that
they are gonna start big--

15:18.501 --> 15:20.294
super computers, subway system,

15:20.420 --> 15:22.881
or do you think they're gonna
send out the foot soldiers?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.465
You know, electric pencil
sharpeners, digital clocks,

15:24.591 --> 15:26.593
coffee makers.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.177
Coffee makers?

15:28.302 --> 15:29.512
Never mind.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.972
Just the ravings of a
caffeine-deprived Luddite.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.433
You all right?

15:33.558 --> 15:34.517
Yeah, yeah, sure.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.102
Just... just thinking.

15:36.227 --> 15:39.355
You know, why is it so hard
to understand women?

15:39.480 --> 15:42.275
And thus the beginnings of
another classic comedy routine.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.235
(laughing)

15:44.360 --> 15:45.570
Sorry, Mom, no offense.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.405
None taken.
What's with the coffee maker?

15:47.530 --> 15:50.283
I think it's busted.
Women troubles?

15:50.408 --> 15:52.660
No, no, no, no, no, uh...
Silver's just very emotional.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.662
You know, she's so over
the top with things.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.247
Well, she is a teenager.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.290
And a woman.

15:57.415 --> 15:58.708
What's that supposed to mean?

15:58.833 --> 16:00.084
Have you tried plugging it in?

16:03.546 --> 16:05.047
Aah!

16:05.172 --> 16:06.758
See? Women may be

16:06.883 --> 16:09.594
crazy emotional, but sometimes
they are great with gadgets.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.512
You think women
are crazy emotional?

16:11.638 --> 16:13.723
Well, come on, hon.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.433
That thing with Annie yesterday.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.727
You got upset with me
for no good reason.
It struck a nerve.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.771
This whole idea of a young woman

16:19.896 --> 16:22.315
giving up what she cares about
for the man in her life.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.317
I guess sometimes
I just feel like

16:24.442 --> 16:25.944
I've given up too much
of my photography.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.780
Well, I... I never wanted you
to give up anything.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.574
I know. I wanted to take
a bit of a break

16:31.699 --> 16:33.743
to help us get adjusted to
California and everything.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.412
But now I'm missing it.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.705
Somewhere there's
that elusive balance

16:37.831 --> 16:39.499
between family and career.

16:39.624 --> 16:42.335
And right now that balance
is a little bit off.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.086
(mutters)

16:47.507 --> 16:49.676
Hey! (sighs)

16:50.802 --> 16:54.263
"Went to school. Peace, D."

16:54.388 --> 16:57.475
I think that we missed
the opportunity to give

16:57.600 --> 17:00.144
a very inspirational
parental pep talk.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.354
Hmm.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.356
(laughing)

17:12.615 --> 17:13.700
ETHAN:
Rhonda.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.326
Oh, hey.

17:15.451 --> 17:18.746
Hey, look, sorry
I've been sort of...

17:18.872 --> 17:21.332
avoiding you, but I just...

17:21.457 --> 17:23.792
wanted to sort things out in
my head before I talked to you.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.420
Okay, so you're all sorted then?

17:26.546 --> 17:29.173
Yeah, yeah.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.176
I have a girlfriend.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.220
And yes, we're going
through a rocky patch,

17:34.345 --> 17:36.556
but we're trying to work it out.

17:36.681 --> 17:39.642
Great, well,
I'm thrilled for you both.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.895
No, I still want us
to be friends, though.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.481
Well, I'm sorry, Ethan,
but it's not up to you.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.026
Being friends is not
what I want.

17:48.150 --> 17:51.654
We had a connection, and you
can deny it all you want.

17:51.779 --> 17:52.780
But it was still there.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.449
No, I'm not denying it.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.785
But I'm with Annie.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.829
And that's that.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.498
Well, I can't just pretend that
I don't have feelings for you.

18:02.623 --> 18:05.334
And that's that.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.420
So, where does that leave us?

18:07.545 --> 18:10.464
I guess that we're just...

18:10.590 --> 18:11.841
not friends.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.945
What are you doing here?

18:32.070 --> 18:33.571
I'm here to
tutor you, remember?

18:33.696 --> 18:34.948
You ditched me yesterday.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.408
That's 'cause
I don't need a tutor.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.744
Look, Liam,

18:39.869 --> 18:42.413
I'm really sorry
about the champagne.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.748
I feel really bad.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.541
It was an honest mistake.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.460
I didn't mean to
get you in trouble.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.629
Can we just start over?

18:49.754 --> 18:51.464
Hi, I'm Naomi.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.969
What do you want from me...
Naomi?

18:56.970 --> 18:58.596
Nothing.

18:58.721 --> 18:59.889
So, why are you here?

19:00.014 --> 19:03.350
I'm here to tutor you in math.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.477
Of course.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.771
Of course.

19:06.896 --> 19:10.775
Well, knock yourself out.

19:10.900 --> 19:15.071
Great, um, so,

19:15.195 --> 19:18.574
we'll just, uh, start with the
basics; we're studying angles.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.409
Oh, here we go.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.787
There's different
types of angles.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.872
These two are not acute.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.206
Not acute?

19:26.332 --> 19:28.793
No, they, um...

19:28.918 --> 19:30.628
Acute angles are
less than 180...

19:30.753 --> 19:34.423
Um... less than 90
degrees, I mean.

19:34.548 --> 19:35.758
Uh, these are congruent.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.802
Supplementary.
What?

19:37.927 --> 19:39.428
Interior angles
on the same side

19:39.553 --> 19:41.806
of the transversal
are supplementary.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.223
They need to be
on opposite sides

19:43.349 --> 19:44.642
of the transversal
to be congruent.

19:44.767 --> 19:45.559
How do you know that?

19:45.685 --> 19:46.769
I told you.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.312
I don't need a tutor.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.107
Now, I would love
to hear you take a whack

19:51.231 --> 19:53.359
at obtuse angles,
but I got to take off.

19:53.484 --> 19:56.570
So, how about
you get off my car?

19:56.696 --> 19:58.572
What do you say
you take me with you?

19:58.698 --> 20:00.282
It's not your kind of scene.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.205
I'm willing to take that risk.

20:08.499 --> 20:09.834
Fine.

20:09.959 --> 20:12.586
But don't say I didn't warn you.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.672
You're in for
a long ride.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.809
(sighs)

20:26.934 --> 20:29.145
Please un-quit
the play.

20:29.269 --> 20:30.855
We desperately,
desperately need you.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.356
I can't.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.649
Why not?

20:33.774 --> 20:36.694
This whole acting thing,
it's messing with me.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.237
Doesn't it feel weird

20:38.362 --> 20:40.823
constantly putting yourself
in someone else's brain?

20:40.948 --> 20:42.366
Are you kidding?

20:42.491 --> 20:43.367
I love it.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.952
It takes me out
of my own.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.746
Yeah, well,
I-I don't want

20:46.871 --> 20:47.955
to forget who
I am right now.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.207
I can't.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.042
I got to get back
to being the girl

20:51.167 --> 20:52.793
that Ethan fell
in love with.

20:52.919 --> 20:53.961
Hmm.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.505
This is about Ethan.

20:56.630 --> 20:57.840
Kind of.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.383
We're having problems.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.928
Um, something
really bad happened

21:02.053 --> 21:03.554
the night
of the Valentine's dance.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.514
Yeah, I know, I heard.

21:05.639 --> 21:06.473
You did?

21:06.599 --> 21:07.641
How?

21:07.767 --> 21:10.310
Well, Navid, he kind of saw.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.729
Navid saw?

21:11.854 --> 21:14.607
Wait, what are you...
what are you talking about?

21:14.732 --> 21:15.733
You first.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.985
What exactly did Navid see?

21:18.111 --> 21:20.738
Oh, I... well, I don't even know
if it's... it's true.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.656
Navid's vision
does weird things at night.

21:22.782 --> 21:23.824
Adrianna...

21:23.950 --> 21:25.159
He thought he saw
a baby alien once,

21:25.284 --> 21:26.493
and it turned out
to be a squirrel.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.371
Adrianna, what did he see?

21:33.084 --> 21:36.670
He saw Ethan and Rhonda kissing
in the parking lot

21:36.796 --> 21:39.506
after the Valentine's
Day dance.

21:53.729 --> 21:58.025
I cannot believe you fooled
around with my boyfriend.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.111
Um, can we... can
we go somewhere?

22:00.236 --> 22:01.946
You are such a hypocrite,
the both of you.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.615
Going... going around talking
about honesty

22:04.740 --> 22:07.076
and how the accident changed you
and all the great things

22:07.201 --> 22:08.995
you want to do
to expand your horizons.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.038
Little did I know that
expanding your horizons

22:11.164 --> 22:13.457
was actually code for becoming
a lying, cheating whore.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.668
Okay, look,
I am not that kind of girl.

22:15.793 --> 22:16.669
(laughs)
I thought you guys

22:16.794 --> 22:17.837
were over.

22:17.962 --> 22:19.379
Well, guess what, we're not.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.464
Yeah, I know.

22:20.589 --> 22:21.882
Ethan explained that things

22:22.008 --> 22:23.550
have been kind of rocky
between you two.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.678
He also said
that as long

22:25.803 --> 22:26.804
as he had a girlfriend

22:26.929 --> 22:27.972
that nothing
was gonna happen between us.

22:28.097 --> 22:30.474
(sighs) Great.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.852
So, you're just lying around,
ready to pounce?

22:32.977 --> 22:34.687
No, of course not.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.522
I totally get why you're mad,

22:36.647 --> 22:38.774
but this isn't a conversation
to have with me.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.110
It's a conversation you need
to have with your boyfriend.

22:41.235 --> 22:42.778
(scoffs)

22:42.903 --> 22:44.238
ANNIE:
It's me.

22:44.362 --> 22:47.658
I heard about you
and your Valentine.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.536
I'm so angry,
I can't even find words.

22:50.661 --> 22:51.829
Except I can.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.039
Yeah, a couple.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.748
Like "liar" and "cheater."

22:56.209 --> 22:57.960
Great work tonight,
you especially.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.837
Excellent.
Ms. Casey?

22:59.962 --> 23:01.630
Yeah.
Hi, um...

23:01.755 --> 23:04.842
so, look, I-I made a mistake
in quitting the play.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.635
I don't even know
what I was thinking.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.930
Well, I do, but I think
differently now,

23:10.056 --> 23:12.516
and I would really like
to play Charmian again.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.684
Is it too late?

23:13.809 --> 23:15.644
I'm sorry, Annie.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.104
Uh...

23:17.230 --> 23:19.606
Cammy Zuggler is...
is now playing Charmian.

23:19.732 --> 23:20.691
Maybe next semester.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.277
(sighs)

23:24.570 --> 23:25.779
Are you okay?

23:25.905 --> 23:28.115
She wouldn't let me back
in the play.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.117
No, I meant
about the Ethan stuff.

23:30.243 --> 23:32.410
I'm really sorry.

23:33.662 --> 23:34.705
Why?

23:34.830 --> 23:37.750
You didn't kiss Rhonda.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.752
Yo, Annie. Juno.

23:39.877 --> 23:42.588
A bunch of us are going
to go hang at Griffith Park.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.173
You want in?
Negatory.

23:44.298 --> 23:45.716
I have a date
with Navid.

23:45.841 --> 23:46.884
(giggles)

23:47.009 --> 23:48.135
Annie?

23:49.803 --> 23:51.429
I'll go.

23:53.307 --> 23:56.602
♪ ♪

24:11.909 --> 24:13.493
ANNIE:
Hey, it's me.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.454
I heard about you
and your Valentine.

24:29.802 --> 24:30.886
SILVER:
Hey, what's going on?

24:31.011 --> 24:32.512
It's good to see you.

24:32.638 --> 24:33.722
Hey, Mary,
hey, Kendra.

24:33.847 --> 24:34.848
Welcome.

24:34.974 --> 24:35.933
Thanks.
Hi, ladies.

24:36.058 --> 24:37.517
Appreciate it--
thank you.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.019
Where is everyone?

24:39.145 --> 24:40.687
I put a big invite
on my blog.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.898
Well, it was kind
of last minute.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.108
Our school is
full of losers.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.902
What could they possibly
have going on tonight?

24:47.027 --> 24:48.904
Sir Matthews,
welcome.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.823
Way to get around
the time limit.

24:50.948 --> 24:51.949
Well, I didn't want
to butcher the narrative.

24:52.074 --> 24:53.117
Yeah, well...

24:53.242 --> 24:55.119
geez, I'm excited.

24:55.244 --> 24:56.996
Oh, I have an idea.

24:57.121 --> 24:59.790
Um, will you do, like, a little
introduction before the film?

24:59.915 --> 25:01.792
You know, like... kind of like
they do at the Arclight?

25:01.917 --> 25:03.710
Yeah, sure, why not?

25:03.836 --> 25:05.503
You are the best
teacher ever.

25:13.012 --> 25:16.182
So, when did you stop
going to school?

25:16.307 --> 25:18.017
Oh, me and my mom moved
here in January,

25:18.142 --> 25:19.726
so... January.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.229
How did you do it?

25:22.355 --> 25:24.273
She told me to enroll
at West Beverly.

25:24.398 --> 25:25.774
I didn't.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.026
How were you
gonna cover up

25:27.151 --> 25:28.902
all the report cards
and stuff like that?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.570
My mom's not really
the report card type.

25:30.696 --> 25:33.573
So long as I'm
going, she's happy.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.284
When she found
out I wasn't...

25:35.409 --> 25:36.785
not so happy.

25:36.910 --> 25:38.162
I don't get it.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.246
I mean, you're
obviously smart.

25:39.372 --> 25:40.914
Why not go
to school?

25:41.040 --> 25:43.042
School bores me.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.960
The bell rings, and
the cattle move

25:45.085 --> 25:47.129
from room to room
every 45 minutes.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.382
I'm all for learning.

25:49.507 --> 25:51.800
Just not exactly what
they want me to learn

25:51.925 --> 25:54.178
or how they want
me to learn it.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.389
See, I'm an
autodidact.

25:57.848 --> 25:59.016
Means self-taught.

25:59.141 --> 26:01.185
Yeah, I know
what it means.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.437
Sure.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.105
There's a whole
world of knowledge

26:05.231 --> 26:06.232
and experience
out there,

26:06.357 --> 26:07.774
things that you don't
learn at school.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.568
That's what I'm
interested in.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.590
(sighs)

26:34.468 --> 26:36.762
So, where are
we, exactly?

26:36.887 --> 26:39.639
A long way
from Beverly Hills.

26:39.765 --> 26:40.849
You scared?

26:40.974 --> 26:42.059
What?

26:42.184 --> 26:43.310
No, of course not.

26:43.436 --> 26:44.895
Then why are you clutching
your purse so tight?

26:48.023 --> 26:50.817
This purse happens to be worth
more than your car.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.319
Yeah?

26:52.445 --> 26:54.738
This is a V-8 engine.

26:54.863 --> 26:58.117
360 horsepower,
500 pounds of torque on tap.

26:58.242 --> 26:59.243
I can guarantee it's worth more

26:59.368 --> 27:00.286
than that purse.

27:00.411 --> 27:01.912
(car engine purring)

27:02.037 --> 27:04.248
Naomi, I'm about
to race these guys,

27:04.373 --> 27:05.958
so your little
adventure

27:06.083 --> 27:07.084
ends here.

27:07.209 --> 27:09.169
Drag racing.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.130
That's what you
autodidact yourself about?

27:11.255 --> 27:12.965
Racing is physics.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.841
And math.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.469
And a hell of a lot of fun.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.430
But it's also dangerous
and illegal,

27:19.555 --> 27:21.140
so I'm going to call you a cab.

27:21.265 --> 27:22.266
What do you think?

27:24.101 --> 27:25.894
I think...

27:27.980 --> 27:29.856
I'd rather go
for a ride.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.444
(door opening)

27:36.238 --> 27:37.781
Uh, hello, everybody.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.032
Uh, I would like

27:39.158 --> 27:41.201
to introduce
the first film,

27:41.327 --> 27:43.078
uh, from a new auteur.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.871
The, uh, inspirational...

27:44.997 --> 27:46.415
the enthusiastic...

27:46.540 --> 27:48.417
the unusual Erin Silver.

27:48.542 --> 27:49.418
(scattered chuckles)

27:49.543 --> 27:51.378
Um, uh, it's
been a pleasure

27:51.504 --> 27:53.255
teaching her and, um...

27:53.380 --> 27:54.340
and... and I look forward

27:54.465 --> 27:56.008
to teaching her more
in the future.

27:56.133 --> 27:59.219
And, uh, you know,
with that said, enjoy.

27:59.345 --> 28:00.804
(scattered applause)

28:06.435 --> 28:08.728
Can't wait
to see it.

28:08.854 --> 28:11.731
(soft piano music playing
over speakers)

28:14.610 --> 28:16.195
SILVER (over speakers):
She walks in beauty,

28:16.320 --> 28:18.238
like the night
of cloudless climes

28:18.364 --> 28:19.781
and starry skies.

28:23.536 --> 28:26.079
And all that's best
of dark and bright

28:26.205 --> 28:28.415
meet in her aspect
and her eyes.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.669
(whispering):
Hey, that's pretty cool.

28:31.793 --> 28:34.547
Thus mellowed
to that tender light,

28:34.672 --> 28:37.090
which Heaven
to gaudy day denies.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.134
I'm in it?

28:39.259 --> 28:41.094
Just you wait.

28:41.220 --> 28:44.097
I love you.

28:44.223 --> 28:47.518
One shade the more,
one ray the less

28:47.643 --> 28:50.354
had half impaired
the nameless grace which waves

28:50.479 --> 28:52.814
in every raven tress.

28:52.939 --> 28:56.569
Or softly lightened
o'er her face

28:56.694 --> 28:59.488
where thoughts
serenely sweet express.

28:59.613 --> 29:01.865
How pure, how dear

29:01.990 --> 29:03.742
their dwelling place.

29:07.162 --> 29:10.499
(hard rock music playing
over speakers)

29:10.624 --> 29:12.501
GIRL:
Oh, my God!
