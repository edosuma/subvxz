00:00.916 --> 00:02.666
Previously on "Teen Wolf"...

00:02.690 --> 00:04.123
I can't hold on!

00:05.439 --> 00:07.987
What's happening?
You're a werewolf.

00:08.010 --> 00:09.794
No, wait!

00:10.495 --> 00:13.678
Whatever you are, I'd like
to help you figure it out.

00:13.781 --> 00:17.882
You're an Alpha of your own pack.
You're gonna be good at this.

01:02.589 --> 01:05.029
All right, you've had
long enough. Let's go.

01:08.628 --> 01:11.341
I'm not buying
the catatonic act.

01:11.365 --> 01:13.845
So don't think that I'm
going to drop my guard.

01:19.406 --> 01:21.406
I know you can hear me.

01:24.878 --> 01:26.923
Look at me when
I'm talking to you.

01:26.947 --> 01:29.012
I said look at me!

01:32.586 --> 01:33.852
Lydia.

02:13.627 --> 02:14.937
Is she all right?

02:14.961 --> 02:17.840
She's fine.
It's all part of the act.

02:17.864 --> 02:19.931
She's just
a dedicated performer.

02:24.538 --> 02:26.582
Up the dosage to three mils.

02:26.606 --> 02:29.441
She wants catatonic?
Give it to her.

02:34.448 --> 02:36.726
Sorry about her, Lydia.

02:36.750 --> 02:39.117
She doesn't have the
gentlest bedside manner.

02:40.153 --> 02:41.920
But I can be gentle.

02:47.093 --> 02:48.860
I promise to be gentle.

02:58.805 --> 03:00.672
Are you all right, Lydia?

03:07.647 --> 03:09.013
Sorry about that. I...

03:10.484 --> 03:11.594
Couldn't find a vein.

03:11.618 --> 03:12.917
I'll have to...

03:13.687 --> 03:14.886
Try again.

03:35.108 --> 03:36.108
I'll...

03:37.544 --> 03:39.511
I'll just have to

03:42.082 --> 03:43.815
find a bigger vein.

05:42.268 --> 05:43.980
Sorry, Lydia.

05:44.004 --> 05:46.044
But your treatment's not done.

05:46.706 --> 05:48.206
Not yet.

05:54.381 --> 05:55.913
Please, I have to tell them!

05:57.651 --> 05:59.751
They're going to die.

06:01.054 --> 06:02.320
My friends.

06:04.190 --> 06:05.990
They're all going to die.

06:54.725 --> 06:56.752
All right, so I found
some cool two bedrooms

06:56.776 --> 06:58.888
in the Mission District,
but they're pretty expensive.

06:58.912 --> 07:00.456
A couple in Haight and Ashbury.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.891
Also expensive.

07:01.915 --> 07:03.426
What about Berkeley?

07:03.450 --> 07:04.927
Don't a lot of students
live around there?

07:04.951 --> 07:06.862
Yeah, yeah,
we could try Nob Hill.

07:06.886 --> 07:08.130
But, the Jeep would

07:08.154 --> 07:09.894
probably burn through
a lot of clutches.

07:10.290 --> 07:11.434
You're bringing the Jeep?

07:11.458 --> 07:12.902
You know the plan, okay.

07:12.926 --> 07:14.759
No one gets left behind.
That's the plan.

07:14.961 --> 07:16.405
Lydia's not gonna have a problem

07:16.429 --> 07:17.406
getting into Stanford.

07:17.430 --> 07:18.808
Kira's thinking USF.

07:18.832 --> 07:20.643
Malia's, uh, gonna,

07:20.667 --> 07:22.377
you know, she'll figure
something out, okay.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.412
The plan's perfect.

07:23.436 --> 07:25.014
Or we could also wait until
we actually get into college

07:25.038 --> 07:26.115
and then figure out
where to live.

07:26.139 --> 07:27.850
I have a vision, dude. Okay?

07:27.874 --> 07:29.151
And it is a beautiful vision.

07:29.175 --> 07:30.508
Don't ruin the vision.

07:31.911 --> 07:33.923
Okay, we can check out
the East Bay.

07:33.947 --> 07:35.587
Haven't looked at
Oakland yet, you know.

07:39.285 --> 07:41.125
You're all right?
You're starting to feel it?

07:41.488 --> 07:42.887
No. Just thinking.

07:43.389 --> 07:44.389
About what?

07:45.391 --> 07:47.203
Senior year.

07:47.227 --> 07:48.926
Senior year, come on,
that's, that's...

07:52.365 --> 07:53.291
That's nothing.
That's going to be easy.

07:53.315 --> 07:55.635
It's more like something
Deaton told me once.

07:56.069 --> 07:58.013
You ever hear of
regression to the mean?

07:58.037 --> 07:59.203
No, I don't think so.

07:59.939 --> 08:02.284
It was his way of saying that

08:02.308 --> 08:05.788
life can't ever be
all bad or all good.

08:05.812 --> 08:08.224
You know, eventually things have
to come back to the middle.

08:08.248 --> 08:09.892
So, think about
the last few months.

08:09.916 --> 08:11.427
Things have been good, right?

08:11.451 --> 08:13.529
But not amazing.

08:13.553 --> 08:17.533
Yeah, but no one's tried to
kill us in six months either.

08:17.557 --> 08:20.291
Right. We've been pretty much
in the middle for a while.

08:21.227 --> 08:22.838
Which means, at some point,

08:22.862 --> 08:25.908
the scale has to tip
one way or the other.

08:25.932 --> 08:28.412
Things are gonna get
really good again...

08:29.936 --> 08:31.335
Or really bad.

08:37.811 --> 08:39.243
Think it's been long enough?

08:39.913 --> 08:41.312
Yes!

08:43.249 --> 08:46.061
Hey. Trying to have an adult
conversation over here.

08:46.085 --> 08:47.463
All right, you're two
years older than me.

08:47.487 --> 08:48.531
And I'm fine.

08:48.555 --> 08:50.822
Just let me go.

08:52.491 --> 08:54.136
It's not that we don't trust you.
It's that I don't trust you.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.538
But after that last full moon...

08:55.562 --> 08:57.439
It was one slip up.

08:57.463 --> 08:59.975
Slip up? A dozen calls to
the Sheriff's Department

08:59.999 --> 09:01.410
about a "monstrous dog-boy"

09:01.434 --> 09:03.512
"running around the streets
of Beacon Hills naked."

09:03.536 --> 09:04.776
That's a slip up?

09:05.371 --> 09:06.982
Why were you naked?

09:07.006 --> 09:08.606
It was really hot
out that night, okay.

09:08.942 --> 09:10.252
Let me go.

09:10.276 --> 09:11.516
You sure you're okay?

09:12.245 --> 09:13.444
It won't happen again.

09:15.348 --> 09:17.828
You're in complete
and total control?

09:19.519 --> 09:21.185
Yeah. Complete and total.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.212
Yes, ma'am, we're having trouble
with the power as well.

09:36.236 --> 09:37.796
It's most likely
related to the storm.

09:38.304 --> 09:39.849
Parrish!

09:39.873 --> 09:42.353
Check the backup generator
and make sure it's fueled.

09:42.542 --> 09:43.986
And Parrish...

09:44.010 --> 09:45.276
Answer the phone.

09:49.249 --> 09:50.392
Six months.

09:50.416 --> 09:52.428
Six months of directing traffic,

09:52.452 --> 09:54.463
doing courthouse security,
serving subpoenas,

09:54.487 --> 09:57.066
and today I finished a total
organizational overhaul

09:57.090 --> 09:58.200
of evidence lock-up.

09:58.224 --> 09:59.468
Now I'm stuck behind
the front desk

09:59.492 --> 10:00.870
while there's
downed power-lines,

10:00.894 --> 10:02.304
a jackknifed tractor-trailer

10:02.328 --> 10:04.039
and reports of
gunshots downtown.

10:04.063 --> 10:05.407
I don't know what I did
to lose your trust,

10:05.431 --> 10:07.598
but you need every
available deputy out there.

10:11.104 --> 10:13.004
Okay, got something for you.

10:17.644 --> 10:19.288
A noise complaint? Yeah.

10:19.312 --> 10:21.223
Somebody would make a noise.

10:21.247 --> 10:22.491
Somebody else
complained about it.

10:22.515 --> 10:23.675
Check it out.

10:45.571 --> 10:47.616
Hello?

10:47.640 --> 10:50.074
This is the Beacon
County Sheriff's Department.

11:13.266 --> 11:14.332
Hello?

11:15.735 --> 11:17.101
Hello!

11:31.651 --> 11:33.651
Hey! Hey, can you hear me?

11:35.120 --> 11:36.565
Okay, okay, I'm going to
get you out of there.

11:36.589 --> 11:38.356
I'm coming right back.
Just hang on.

11:48.501 --> 11:50.421
I'm here, I'm here!
Back up if you can.

12:45.058 --> 12:46.058
Not a werewolf,

12:47.627 --> 12:49.126
but you're something.

12:57.370 --> 12:59.610
Now, you're no ordinary
creature, Deputy.

13:01.140 --> 13:02.506
But then, neither am I.

13:03.509 --> 13:04.542
Not tonight.

13:12.151 --> 13:14.663
I'll let you live
if you answer one question.

13:14.687 --> 13:16.287
Where is Scott McCall?

13:18.658 --> 13:19.824
Never heard of him.

13:32.438 --> 13:33.549
Is it a party? It's not a party.

13:33.573 --> 13:35.053
Then what's at midnight?
Your bedtime.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.186
Why aren't the girls going?

13:37.210 --> 13:38.637
They're meeting us there, okay?

13:38.661 --> 13:40.089
And just stop asking
questions, all right?

13:40.113 --> 13:41.423
It's a senior thing.

13:41.447 --> 13:43.927
You'll know when
you're a senior.

13:44.350 --> 13:45.950
You guys having trouble
with your phones?

13:46.752 --> 13:48.352
Oh. What the hell?

13:54.293 --> 13:57.239
You out of gas?
No, it's electrical.

13:57.263 --> 13:58.529
Probably the alternator again.

14:05.805 --> 14:07.925
Whoa, that's a lot of duct tape.

14:08.374 --> 14:10.185
Kidding. We'll fix it.

14:10.209 --> 14:11.587
I know,

14:11.611 --> 14:13.422
it's just the last night
of summer, you know,

14:13.446 --> 14:15.757
so I wanted to make sure
everyone was there tonight.

14:15.781 --> 14:17.359
We'll make it.

14:17.383 --> 14:18.823
You got any tools? Yeah.

14:33.399 --> 14:34.665
Guys...

14:38.204 --> 14:39.548
Guys!

14:39.572 --> 14:41.283
Yeah, give us a second, please.

14:41.307 --> 14:43.747
Liam, stay in the car, okay?

14:49.315 --> 14:50.755
That was close. Very close.

14:56.923 --> 14:58.422
Can we go now?

15:05.264 --> 15:06.842
All right, here we go.

15:06.866 --> 15:08.510
Everybody get a good grip.

15:08.534 --> 15:10.712
Remember, lift with your legs.

15:10.736 --> 15:12.381
That's where your power is.

15:12.405 --> 15:15.306
One, two, three.

15:30.523 --> 15:31.523
Strong legs.

15:35.628 --> 15:37.548
Dad, is your phone working?

15:38.864 --> 15:41.632
No, I think the storm
took the cell towers out.

15:43.636 --> 15:45.747
It's going to be okay.

15:45.771 --> 15:48.550
You'll find out
when you find out.

15:48.574 --> 15:50.307
Do you need a ride
to the school?

15:54.347 --> 15:55.613
Got one.

15:56.349 --> 15:57.589
Sorry we're late.

15:58.884 --> 15:59.884
Hey.

16:04.490 --> 16:06.335
I'm sorry too.

16:06.359 --> 16:08.425
You boys do remember
I own a gun, right?

16:08.794 --> 16:09.914
Vividly.

16:17.937 --> 16:19.837
What? Did you find out yet?

16:20.606 --> 16:21.817
Find out what?

16:21.841 --> 16:23.252
They're gonna email me.

16:23.276 --> 16:24.516
Is this about summer school?

16:25.278 --> 16:26.855
You told him? Uh...

16:26.879 --> 16:28.790
Oh, no, all they said was you
had to go to summer school

16:28.814 --> 16:30.792
'cause the principal said your
test scores weren't good enough

16:30.816 --> 16:32.616
and you might have
to repeat junior year.

16:36.689 --> 16:39.129
We should've left him
chained to the tree.

16:42.328 --> 16:44.039
Scott, I'm home

16:44.063 --> 16:45.741
but I have to rush out again.

16:45.765 --> 16:48.299
The hospital has called
everybody back in.

16:49.702 --> 16:51.068
So, dinner's in the fridge!

16:53.839 --> 16:55.884
There's nothing in the fridge!

16:55.908 --> 16:58.575
So, I'm gonna leave you
money to order in!

17:01.981 --> 17:03.759
I don't have any money!

17:03.783 --> 17:06.064
Get something and
I'll pay you back!

17:08.554 --> 17:09.794
You're not even here, are you?

17:24.569 --> 17:26.013
Of course you're not here.

17:26.038 --> 17:27.877
Everybody's at the high school.

17:54.967 --> 17:56.478
Kira.

17:56.502 --> 17:58.369
Get back inside the car, please.

18:09.415 --> 18:11.696
I'm not getting anything either.

18:18.858 --> 18:20.618
We haven't moved in 15 minutes.

18:22.628 --> 18:23.504
I'm going to be late.

18:23.528 --> 18:24.406
What is this thing
you're going to anyway?

18:24.430 --> 18:25.607
It's called Senior Scribe

18:25.631 --> 18:27.271
and I'm not supposed
to tell you about it.

18:27.666 --> 18:29.044
Don't look at me.

18:29.068 --> 18:30.879
I... I don't know
anything either.

18:30.903 --> 18:32.983
Sounds like they're supposed
to write something or...

18:33.539 --> 18:35.083
It sounds like vandalism.

18:35.107 --> 18:36.147
It's not vandalism.

18:37.777 --> 18:39.417
At least, I don't think it is.

18:48.821 --> 18:50.766
That's it. I'm going. What?

18:50.790 --> 18:52.189
You're going to walk? Yep.

18:54.627 --> 18:57.428
In a few minutes.

19:02.701 --> 19:03.845
My dad's helping out in surgery.

19:03.869 --> 19:05.847
He's not gonna be
done for hours.

19:05.871 --> 19:08.083
So I'm either hanging out here

19:08.107 --> 19:09.587
or I could still go
with you guys...

19:11.577 --> 19:12.810
Show me your hands.

19:19.618 --> 19:21.963
Okay, so I'm still
having trouble.

19:21.987 --> 19:24.021
No. You're still learning.

19:26.025 --> 19:28.025
What do you do to stay
focused on not changing?

19:30.796 --> 19:32.941
But it's not working.

19:32.965 --> 19:34.910
It's working enough.

19:34.934 --> 19:36.745
Listen, Derek told me that
you were one of the strongest

19:36.769 --> 19:39.548
that he'd ever seen at your age.

19:39.572 --> 19:41.138
Now, coming from him
that means a lot.

19:43.576 --> 19:46.210
Maybe means that things are gonna
be harder for you for a while

19:50.483 --> 19:52.323
but it also means
something else, doesn't it?

19:52.718 --> 19:54.184
That I'm really strong?

19:56.922 --> 19:57.988
Hell, yeah.

20:04.196 --> 20:05.774
Still can't reach Kira.

20:05.798 --> 20:07.642
Okay, you reminded her
about tonight though, right?

20:07.666 --> 20:08.743
I think so.

20:08.767 --> 20:10.212
She only texted me
once this week.

20:10.236 --> 20:12.147
Once? How'd you
guys leave things

20:12.171 --> 20:13.615
when she left for New York?

20:13.639 --> 20:15.149
Well, they were good.

20:15.173 --> 20:16.685
Yeah, I just said, you know,
"Don't worry about anything",

20:16.709 --> 20:17.919
"just go and have fun." No.

20:17.943 --> 20:19.821
You told her to go have fun?

20:19.845 --> 20:21.723
Why? What's wrong with that?

20:21.747 --> 20:23.824
Nothing. Nothing's
wrong with it.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.927
Just, I don't know. That can be
interpreted a lot of different ways.

20:25.951 --> 20:27.028
Like what? Well, like,

20:27.052 --> 20:29.064
"Don't worry,
we're not exclusive."

20:29.088 --> 20:31.655
"Go have fun with other guys."

20:32.091 --> 20:33.568
No. No way.

20:33.592 --> 20:35.036
Malia, if you were going away

20:35.060 --> 20:37.205
and I told you
"Don't worry, go have fun."

20:37.229 --> 20:38.940
What would you think
I was talking about?

20:38.964 --> 20:41.204
Fun like bowling?
Or sex with other guys?

20:42.167 --> 20:43.700
Okay, yeah. Now I'm worried.

20:45.670 --> 20:47.249
25-year-old male,
unrestrained driver involved in...

20:47.273 --> 20:48.884
Hey, Mom, where's
all this coming from?

20:48.908 --> 20:50.285
A jackknifed
tractor-trailer on 115,

20:50.309 --> 20:52.053
caused a major pile up.

20:52.077 --> 20:53.788
Okay, okay, there's only one way

20:53.812 --> 20:55.372
back into Beacon Hills
from the airport.

20:55.614 --> 20:57.158
115.

20:57.182 --> 20:58.302
Kira's never gonna make it.

20:59.618 --> 21:00.618
I can get her.

21:02.755 --> 21:04.232
You guys head to the school.
Lydia's probably already there.

21:04.256 --> 21:06.484
We'll meet you by midnight.

21:06.508 --> 21:08.737
How are you gonna get to her in
the middle of a traffic jam?

21:08.761 --> 21:10.294
We'll make it. Trust me.

21:12.698 --> 21:14.910
Hey, keep it moving, bud.

21:14.934 --> 21:16.745
Come on. Hey. You guys
are making a mistake.

21:16.769 --> 21:18.547
All right.

21:18.571 --> 21:19.811
Come on.

21:19.835 --> 21:21.732
What the hell are you trying to do?
Break my arm?

21:21.756 --> 21:24.085
Keep struggling and I'll be
aiming for a compound fracture.

21:24.109 --> 21:26.469
Donovan, you forgot what
the judge said, didn't you?

21:27.613 --> 21:29.613
"Next time is jail time."

21:31.684 --> 21:33.951
Stilinski... What?
Hold up. Come on.

21:34.853 --> 21:36.598
What's he in for? B and E.

21:36.622 --> 21:38.087
And he was carrying
a loaded .38.

21:39.858 --> 21:41.736
Okay, it wasn't mine.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.120
Sheriff, come on.
It wasn't mine.

21:43.729 --> 21:44.928
Book him.

21:46.031 --> 21:47.664
Oh, you're dead.

21:48.867 --> 21:51.279
Hey, look at me! You're dead!

21:51.303 --> 21:54.649
You're dead! You're
going to do this to me?

21:54.673 --> 21:56.073
You son of a bitch, you're dead!

21:56.208 --> 21:57.586
Look at me!

21:57.610 --> 21:58.954
Can anyone tell me,

21:58.978 --> 22:01.345
why the hell
Parrish isn't back yet?

23:28.434 --> 23:30.345
Dispatch.

23:30.369 --> 23:31.835
Officer...

23:32.371 --> 23:33.704
Officer down.

23:43.048 --> 23:44.181
Jordan.

23:44.850 --> 23:45.916
I'm here.

23:54.793 --> 23:55.892
I'm right here.

24:09.775 --> 24:10.974
Stay with me.

24:15.514 --> 24:17.214
Parrish?

24:23.322 --> 24:24.322
Parrish?

24:31.764 --> 24:33.808
Okay, okay, easy, easy.

24:33.832 --> 24:36.010
You said you were gonna
keep him on desk duty.

24:36.034 --> 24:38.113
Yeah, it was just
a minor noise complaint.

24:38.137 --> 24:39.377
He's not on fire, is he?

24:40.439 --> 24:42.450
Not that I know of.

24:42.474 --> 24:44.975
You know, maybe it's part
of his healing process?

24:58.323 --> 25:00.803
It's okay. It's okay.

25:02.828 --> 25:04.708
Right, Deputy?

25:11.570 --> 25:13.003
Scott.

25:13.872 --> 25:15.138
We need to find Scott.

25:17.810 --> 25:19.821
You know there's a legend

25:19.845 --> 25:21.322
for a storm like this.

25:21.346 --> 25:23.892
Dad, please don't turn
a three-hour traffic jam

25:23.916 --> 25:25.894
into an educational experience.

25:25.918 --> 25:27.884
He's talking about
The Wild Hunt.

25:29.822 --> 25:31.466
About the Ghost Riders.

25:31.490 --> 25:34.068
Imagine a night like this, Kira.

25:34.092 --> 25:37.038
In storm clouds just like these,

25:37.062 --> 25:38.862
phantom hunters would appear.

25:40.332 --> 25:43.578
Riding black horses
with blood-red eyes.

25:43.602 --> 25:46.080
And wolves and hounds
at their side,

25:46.104 --> 25:47.537
baying and snarling.

25:48.373 --> 25:49.406
What were they hunting?

25:54.012 --> 25:55.012
Souls.

25:56.381 --> 25:57.381
Noshiko?

25:58.350 --> 25:59.850
Do you hear that?

26:01.019 --> 26:02.259
Kira!

26:23.442 --> 26:24.908
Did you have fun in New York?

26:25.444 --> 26:26.444
Not really.

26:26.645 --> 26:27.911
Good.

26:44.563 --> 26:45.940
His claws were different.

26:45.964 --> 26:47.041
Twice the size of Scott's.

26:47.065 --> 26:48.509
More like talons.

26:48.533 --> 26:50.178
If that's the worst part,
that doesn't sound too bad.

26:50.202 --> 26:52.647
It's worse.
They did something to me.

26:52.671 --> 26:54.598
I don't know how
to describe it other than

26:54.622 --> 26:56.551
it felt as if the life was being
drawn out of me through them.

26:56.575 --> 26:57.919
Through the claws.

26:57.943 --> 26:59.487
And now he's looking for Scott?

26:59.511 --> 27:02.624
Which got me thinking about
what this guy can do.

27:02.648 --> 27:03.958
The rule is you have
to kill an Alpha

27:03.982 --> 27:05.126
to steal their power, right?

27:05.150 --> 27:06.361
I'll bet it's different
for Scott.

27:06.385 --> 27:09.419
You can't steal
a True Alpha's power.

27:10.656 --> 27:12.255
I think this guy can.

27:29.074 --> 27:30.351
We're not late, are we?

27:30.375 --> 27:31.608
No, they're on their way.

27:32.678 --> 27:34.322
What are you smiling at?

27:34.346 --> 27:35.412
You.

28:03.208 --> 28:04.452
Nothing from Scott or Kira.

28:04.476 --> 28:06.220
And nothing from Lydia either.

28:06.244 --> 28:08.724
And I still don't
know if I passed.

28:13.719 --> 28:16.319
I don't want to do this
unless I'm actually a senior.

28:17.122 --> 28:18.188
Yeah.

28:27.265 --> 28:28.676
What's wrong with you?

28:28.700 --> 28:29.780
You smell terrible.

28:31.036 --> 28:32.580
Yeah, it's called anxiety.

28:32.604 --> 28:34.515
Should be a familiar
scent for you by now,

28:34.539 --> 28:37.552
since it's pretty much
a constant state for me.

28:37.576 --> 28:39.896
Why's this thing
so important to you?

28:40.078 --> 28:41.556
It's not.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.013
It's not. It's uh...

28:45.217 --> 28:46.516
I don't know. Maybe it is.

28:50.689 --> 28:54.335
I asked my dad the other day
about his high school friends.

28:54.359 --> 28:55.636
Guess how many
he still talks to?

28:55.660 --> 28:56.738
None.

28:56.762 --> 28:58.439
Not a single one.

28:58.463 --> 29:00.308
You know,
these were his best friends

29:00.332 --> 29:02.076
and he just says he lost
touch with them, you know.

29:02.100 --> 29:03.478
So I started thinking about
things, like I always do.

29:03.502 --> 29:04.679
Obsessively.

29:04.703 --> 29:07.382
Yeah. And so
I'm thinking, what if...

29:07.406 --> 29:09.751
What if Scott's
my best friend now

29:09.775 --> 29:12.342
you know, but he's not
my best friend for life?

29:13.412 --> 29:15.189
Well, doesn't that just
happen sometimes?

29:15.213 --> 29:17.358
Yeah, but only because
we let it happen.

29:17.382 --> 29:19.576
You know,
that's what I'm saying.

29:19.600 --> 29:21.796
How come when we graduate we're just
expected to go our separate ways?

29:21.820 --> 29:23.731
If I've already found
the best people in my life,

29:23.755 --> 29:26.534
why aren't I not trying to
stay with them, you know?

29:26.558 --> 29:28.703
Well, I thought that
was the plan. The dream.

29:28.727 --> 29:31.039
The vision.
And don't mock the vision.

29:31.063 --> 29:32.303
I... I like the vision.

29:34.199 --> 29:36.439
Especially if I'm part of it.

29:44.409 --> 29:45.919
So that's why you wanted
everyone here tonight.

29:45.943 --> 29:49.343
Because you don't want to lose all
your friends after senior year.

29:49.581 --> 29:51.815
And I hope they don't
want to lose me either.

30:02.727 --> 30:03.760
Mal?

30:05.163 --> 30:07.323
Someone's coming. Someone fast.

30:10.702 --> 30:12.168
Oh, my God.

30:14.139 --> 30:15.505
Scott's in trouble.

30:36.862 --> 30:38.294
True Alpha?

30:38.897 --> 30:40.396
Where's your power, Scott?

30:42.767 --> 30:45.746
Who are you? A devoted fan.

30:45.770 --> 30:48.216
Show me the man who
took down Deucalion

30:48.240 --> 30:49.784
and broke the Argents.

30:49.808 --> 30:51.252
I came for that Alpha.

30:51.276 --> 30:52.542
Come on!

31:20.572 --> 31:23.012
And I didn't come just
to claim your status.

32:57.335 --> 32:58.746
I don't know who you are

32:58.770 --> 33:01.170
or what you thought
you were going to do,

33:01.406 --> 33:03.517
but I'll give you a choice.

33:03.541 --> 33:05.308
You can stay and I'll
break something else.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.679
Or you can run.

33:13.952 --> 33:15.318
I'd run.

33:31.603 --> 33:33.483
You don't remember me, do you?

33:36.341 --> 33:37.551
I guess I look
a little different

33:37.575 --> 33:38.941
since the fourth grade.

33:40.378 --> 33:41.444
Theo?

33:44.416 --> 33:45.548
You know him?

33:46.818 --> 33:47.818
They used to.

33:50.021 --> 33:53.334
Trust me, I never thought
I'd see you guys again.

33:53.358 --> 33:56.470
Couple of months ago, I heard
of an Alpha in Beacon Hills.

33:56.494 --> 33:58.661
When I found out his
name was Scott McCall,

33:59.698 --> 34:00.797
just couldn't believe it.

34:03.101 --> 34:04.734
Not just an Alpha,

34:05.470 --> 34:06.669
but a True Alpha.

34:10.442 --> 34:11.674
What do you want?

34:12.677 --> 34:14.610
I came back to Beacon Hills.

34:15.547 --> 34:16.713
Back home with my family.

34:19.050 --> 34:20.817
Because I want to be
a part of your pack.

34:31.029 --> 34:32.672
We haven't seen
this kid in years.

34:32.697 --> 34:34.809
You don't find that
highly suspicious?

34:34.833 --> 34:37.473
I'm kind of more concerned about
the guy who just tried to kill me.

34:39.003 --> 34:40.503
I'm in.

34:41.639 --> 34:42.705
I passed.

34:46.945 --> 34:48.456
I'm officially a senior.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.746
Thank God.

34:50.949 --> 34:52.726
Where have you guys been?

34:52.751 --> 34:54.511
The whole senior class is here.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.853
Are we doing this or not?

35:51.876 --> 35:54.010
This isn't vandalism, is it?

35:55.914 --> 35:57.154
Not technically.

37:12.824 --> 37:14.023
She would have been with us.

37:14.626 --> 37:15.691
Yeah.

37:17.529 --> 37:18.594
She still is.

37:47.545 --> 37:49.545
Give me another chance.

37:50.728 --> 37:52.840
A little more power.

37:52.864 --> 37:54.697
I could do it with
a little more.

38:34.339 --> 38:36.984
No! No! Wait, wait, wait!

38:37.008 --> 38:38.886
Your condition worsens.

38:38.910 --> 38:40.788
I'm okay. I'm okay, just...

38:40.812 --> 38:42.845
Just give me another chance.

38:42.982 --> 38:47.089
You were supposed
to remove the obstacles.

38:47.185 --> 38:49.476
Our time is limited.

38:50.288 --> 38:53.601
Whatever you're here
to do, I can help.

38:53.625 --> 38:54.902
No second chances.

38:54.926 --> 38:55.970
I can help you.

38:55.994 --> 38:57.972
No second chances.

38:57.996 --> 38:59.607
No second chances.

38:59.631 --> 39:00.708
No second chances.

39:00.732 --> 39:01.575
No second chances.

39:01.599 --> 39:03.584
No!

39:22.319 --> 39:24.497
No one saw him again, did they?

39:24.521 --> 39:25.786
No.

39:26.858 --> 39:28.669
But that was the start
of it, wasn't it?

39:28.693 --> 39:30.188
The beginning of senior year.

39:32.030 --> 39:34.311
What happened after that, Lydia?

39:34.899 --> 39:36.664
Oh, you're not Aiden.

39:41.005 --> 39:42.525
You're not real.

39:44.308 --> 39:45.548
Tell me, Lydia.

39:51.783 --> 39:53.616
Tell me what happened to them.

39:54.986 --> 39:57.166
What happened to your friends?

39:58.456 --> 40:00.856
I... I don't remember.

40:08.466 --> 40:10.933
It started just
after you began senior year.

40:11.035 --> 40:12.275
What happened?

40:14.171 --> 40:15.811
I don't remember.

40:22.180 --> 40:23.645
What happened to Kira?

40:33.958 --> 40:35.598
Tell me about Parrish.

40:44.535 --> 40:46.180
And Malia.

40:46.204 --> 40:49.138
What happened when the
Desert Wolf finally found her.

40:55.580 --> 40:57.980
I know you remember what
happened to Stiles?

41:05.757 --> 41:07.000
I can't remember.

41:07.024 --> 41:08.969
That's all right, Lydia.

41:08.993 --> 41:11.393
There are other ways
to get to the details.

41:15.299 --> 41:18.067
This special device is
designed for trepanation.

41:19.804 --> 41:22.638
The medical art of drilling
into the human skull.

41:24.342 --> 41:26.507
Let me you show
you how it works.
