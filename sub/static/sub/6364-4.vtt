13:30.443 --> 13:31.543
- Police!

13:31.545 --> 13:33.545
- Halstead, other side
of the fence!

13:33.547 --> 13:36.314
- Police! Don't move!

13:39.419 --> 13:42.821
[tires screeching]

13:47.360 --> 13:51.396
- Requesting air one.
I don't wanna lose that car.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.498
- One dead offender.
Rest of the building is clear.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.400
- I saw the other girl.
He was putting her in the trunk.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.935
We gotta go.
- All right.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.070
Let's get out of here.
- Hey, you okay? You good?

13:59.072 --> 14:01.139
- Yeah, yeah, we'll catch up.
[girl moans]

14:01.141 --> 14:02.473
- It's all right.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.209
- Hey, what have we got?

14:04.211 --> 14:06.277
- She came
flying out of that window.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.046
I think she's got a couple
of cracked ribs

14:08.048 --> 14:10.281
And maybe her ankle.
- We'll take it from here.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.217
- You're in good hands, hayden.
- All right.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.418
- [moans]
- you're all right.

14:16.323 --> 14:17.889
- We're gonna tilt her up

14:17.891 --> 14:19.424
And just get her
right on this board, okay?

14:19.426 --> 14:21.059
- Okay.
- All right.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.527
- There we go.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.630
- Ready?
- And up.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.932
Coulda been a cop, mills.

14:27.934 --> 14:31.002
- Yeah, yeah. The ball rolls
funny for everybody, huh?

14:33.406 --> 14:35.340
- Thank you. All right, they
must have had a dump car

14:35.342 --> 14:37.242
Or something, 'cause the eye
in the sky got nothing.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.144
- Well, if he's running,

14:39.145 --> 14:41.045
He's gonna be running scared.
- Psst. Hey, hey!

14:44.351 --> 14:46.651
- Eva.

14:46.653 --> 14:49.120
- I know what you're gonna say
and just know that i'm fine,

14:49.122 --> 14:50.655
Everything's fine.
- Where's your mother?

14:50.657 --> 14:53.491
- She's home.
I took the train.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.361
- By yourself?!
Does your mom know?

14:56.363 --> 14:59.330
- I-i called,
and i just left a message.

14:59.332 --> 15:02.133
- You're grounded. You're as
grounded as you've ever been.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.235
- Dad, don't you wanna
know why i came here?

15:04.237 --> 15:06.170
- No! I don't want to hear
anything out of your mouth

15:06.172 --> 15:08.339
Right now except,
"i'm sorry, dad.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.507
This won't happen again, dad."
that's all i want to hear.

15:10.510 --> 15:14.012
- Antonio. Hayden tannenbaum's
ready to give a statement.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.180
- I'm coming.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.483
Nadia.
Come over here?

15:22.489 --> 15:25.423
This is my very-much-in-trouble
daughter, eva.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.292
Can you take her
into that office,

15:27.293 --> 15:29.160
Watch her until i get my wife on
the phone to come pick her up?

15:29.162 --> 15:30.812
- Yeah, of course.
- Dad--

15:30.813 --> 15:32.463
- Not another word, eva.
I mean it.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.602
- Hey. Let's go sit.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.708
- We were tied to the radiator

15:43.710 --> 15:46.611
With those plastic things
you find on packages.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.280
They were getting ready
to move us,

15:49.282 --> 15:52.517
But they must've
seen you guys outside,

15:52.519 --> 15:56.387
'cause they started arguing
amongst themselves,

15:56.389 --> 15:59.390
Saying, "someone's out there,

15:59.392 --> 16:03.494
We gotta do this now,
right now."

16:03.496 --> 16:07.999
So, um...One came over
with a knife

16:08.001 --> 16:11.502
And cut us loose,

16:11.504 --> 16:13.204
And as soon
as i felt myself free,

16:13.206 --> 16:16.507
I didn't even think--it was
like my legs just took over,

16:16.509 --> 16:22.246
And i saw the window
and i just crashed through it.

16:22.248 --> 16:24.415
- Hayden.

16:26.119 --> 16:29.420
Did you get
a look at these guys?

16:29.422 --> 16:33.992
- They wore masks.
They never took 'em off.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.661
I thought i was dead.

16:38.465 --> 16:42.000
And they still have allison?

16:42.002 --> 16:45.236
I shouldn't have left.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.139
[sobbing]
i should've stayed...

16:48.141 --> 16:50.675
- No, hayden.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.277
You did exactly
what you should have done.

16:53.279 --> 16:57.248
You got away.
That was exactly right.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.384
We'll find allison.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.452
[whispers]
it's okay.

17:13.465 --> 17:16.733
- She gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

17:16.736 --> 17:21.406
- And you saw allison?
She was alive? She was okay?

17:21.407 --> 17:23.307
- She's alive.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.246
- Which is a good sign.
That means whoever has her

17:28.248 --> 17:29.614
Is trying to make a deal.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.585
Has anyone contacted you?

17:34.587 --> 17:38.122
- No. But i've been racking
my brain trying to come up

17:38.124 --> 17:39.457
With anyone i've dealt with
that might be

17:39.459 --> 17:44.429
In the...Consideration
for something like this.

17:50.103 --> 17:53.071
I didn't know what to do.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.239
So i wrote down everyone.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.113
- Here you go.

18:05.819 --> 18:09.353
See? Not so bad.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.856
- Oh, no. Totally. I mean,
we're really doing our part

18:11.858 --> 18:13.724
To fight crime
and clean up the streets.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.197
- Hey, ma'am.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.665
What do you got for us?

18:23.570 --> 18:26.537
Whoa! Street sweeper.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.106
- Some punk threw it
in my garden.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.575
Least i don't have
to pay for groceries this week.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.777
You see how much they charge
for a ham these days?

18:32.779 --> 18:35.413
- Do they have good sales here?
- Occasionally.

18:35.415 --> 18:38.282
But i go to the jewels
over by my house on 112th.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.383
They have better prices.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.751
- Okay. Well, thank you,
miss....

18:40.753 --> 18:43.554
- Birdie.
- Thank you, miss birdie.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.456
- Look at this thing.

18:47.427 --> 18:50.428
Wait. There's no way.
- What?

18:50.430 --> 18:52.730
- She said she lived
on 112th street?

18:52.732 --> 18:55.466
- She said
she shopped around there, yeah.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.468
- No way.
- What?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.670
- Hey! Hey!

19:02.509 --> 19:05.910
24s-x7f9.
- What?

19:05.912 --> 19:09.180
- Her license plate!
Write it down! 24s-x7f9.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.516
- 7f9. I got it, i got it!
- 24...

19:11.518 --> 19:13.484
- I got it.
- I know this gun.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.753
Look at this.

19:21.427 --> 19:24.195
We got a gun we think
was used in a triple homicide

19:24.197 --> 19:26.531
I responded to a month ago.
Never solved.

19:26.533 --> 19:30.501
- How does
a gun buyback assignment

19:30.503 --> 19:32.570
Turn into a homicide
investigation?

19:32.572 --> 19:34.705
- Sarge, we think this
is the missing piece.

19:34.707 --> 19:38.776
Only witness said he saw
a guy with a white-tipped gun.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.779
- Do you know what
"no questions asked" means?

19:41.781 --> 19:44.248
The gun buy-back program
is effective

19:44.250 --> 19:46.717
Because we maintain trust
within the community.

19:46.719 --> 19:50.288
If we lose that trust,
guns don't come off the streets.

19:50.290 --> 19:53.424
- But sarge,
this is a homicide.

19:55.628 --> 19:59.730
- Drop this off at homicide
and get back to patrol.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.438
- I.D. Came back
on our dead shooter.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.507
Guy by the name of
jason woodley.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.459
Career criminal.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.410
Two months out of prison after
a stint for armed robbery.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.745
- All right. Jason woodley.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.547
I want everything
we got on this guy.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.449
Family members,
known associates.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.786
- Hank, you got someone
downstairs says she knows you.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.489
You got this?

20:27.527 --> 20:29.427
- Right there.
- Yeah.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.928
- Are you hank?
- Who's asking?

20:30.930 --> 20:33.698
- I'm olive.
Olive morgan.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.267
I remember justin
said you worked here.

20:36.269 --> 20:37.435
Since i didn't
have your address...

20:37.437 --> 20:39.870
- You know justin?
- Uh, yeah.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.439
We dated for a while,
on and off.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.374
Then he disappeared.
I didn't hear from him.

20:43.376 --> 20:46.377
Someone said he might've joined
the marines or something.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.878
I don't know how
to get a hold of him.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.413
I'm not asking for anything.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.649
I just thought he should know
that i'm...

20:51.651 --> 20:54.885
Well...Pregnant.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.323
- It's his?
- Yeah.

20:59.325 --> 21:01.892
I took a few tests at home,
then went to a clinic.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.561
- We should get
to the hospital,

21:03.563 --> 21:05.763
See if hayden knows any more
about jason woodley.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.932
I'll get the car.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.433
- Listen...
- Olive.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.868
- Olive, uh...

21:10.870 --> 21:13.371
I'll have justin
get in touch with you.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.973
All right? Just leave your
number with the desk sergeant.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.742
- Okay. Thanks.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.411
- [sighs]

21:21.614 --> 21:23.748
Hey, look.
I'm sorry, okay?

21:23.750 --> 21:28.486
We're just
really crazed today.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.321
Here's my card.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.356
Just call me later
and we'll talk it over.

21:32.358 --> 21:34.759
- Thank you. I don't mean
to cause any trouble.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.394
- No trouble.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.735
[knock knock]

21:46.506 --> 21:48.506
- Parents finally stop
squeezing you to death?

21:48.508 --> 21:53.044
- They went to get food
and let the dog out.

21:56.883 --> 21:59.450
- Take a look at this.

21:59.452 --> 22:02.953
This is one of the men
who kidnapped you.

22:02.955 --> 22:05.990
Does he look familiar
to you at all?

22:05.992 --> 22:08.759
You ever seen him
before last night?

22:13.633 --> 22:16.600
Hayden, if you know something,
you need to tell me.

22:23.976 --> 22:26.544
- You forget a little detail?
- I gave you everything.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.780
- Not you. You.
- What?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.782
- Jason woodley.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.584
Your daughter said
she saw you talking to him

22:33.586 --> 22:35.886
And another guy a few weeks ago.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.589
- Look, i--
- she saw you talking to him.

22:38.591 --> 22:43.861
The guy my detective shot while
your daughter was escaping!

22:43.863 --> 22:45.463
- You knew him?
- I...

22:45.465 --> 22:46.997
- You knew him?!
- Hey!

22:46.999 --> 22:48.366
Tell him what you know!

22:48.368 --> 22:50.601
- Not this way!
- Get off of me!

22:50.603 --> 22:52.536
He got our daughters kidnapped!
- Walk!

22:52.538 --> 22:54.472
- He knows where my daughter is!
- That way.

22:54.474 --> 22:57.141
- He knows!

23:00.947 --> 23:01.379
.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.980
So what?

23:02.982 --> 23:04.148
A guy from my past was involved?

23:04.150 --> 23:06.650
That doesn't mean nothing.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.864
- That smug face
you're wearing--

23:19.866 --> 23:21.966
It's gonna come off.

23:26.439 --> 23:29.106
Who was the guy with woodley?

23:35.114 --> 23:38.682
- I swear, i had no idea
who was doing this,

23:38.684 --> 23:39.850
Who was involved.

23:41.587 --> 23:43.053
[door opens]

23:43.055 --> 23:44.989
- There's a fat guy
in a suit downstairs.

23:44.991 --> 23:46.424
Looks like he lawyered up.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.926
- Sit tight, gordon.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.462
This is just getting started.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.102
- Sorry, chief.
- Huh?

23:58.104 --> 24:00.571
- Patrol notified woodley's mom.
She's the only known relative.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.006
They're sitting on the house
till we get there.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.674
- All right, so get there.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.916
- Hey.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.597
I talked to your mother.
She's on her way.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.799
She'll be here in half an hour.

24:28.801 --> 24:32.169
- Oh. Okay.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.738
- [sighs]

24:34.740 --> 24:37.041
I'm sorry i snapped at you.

24:37.043 --> 24:40.978
It's just you scared the hell
out of me, honestly.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.548
- But...I wanted to see you.

24:47.119 --> 24:50.888
- Look, um...

24:50.890 --> 24:55.826
Your ma and i,
we're still figuring things out.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.762
She said you might've
heard some things.

24:58.764 --> 25:01.665
- [sobbing]

25:01.667 --> 25:06.170
I don't know what to do.
- Hey, hey, hey.

25:06.172 --> 25:09.106
You need to know something,
eva.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.008
I love you.

25:11.010 --> 25:14.211
I love you and your brother
more than life itself.

25:15.748 --> 25:18.249
- I love you too, dad.

25:18.251 --> 25:21.519
- I'm not giving up
on your mother and me.

25:21.521 --> 25:25.022
Nothing has been decided.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.591
We're just...

25:27.593 --> 25:31.595
We're just in different orbits
right now.

25:31.597 --> 25:34.231
She needs some time,
and i gotta respect that.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.801
- [whispers]
yeah.

25:37.803 --> 25:40.905
- But you...

25:40.907 --> 25:44.041
You, diego and me

25:44.043 --> 25:47.611
Are a knot
that'll never come undone.

25:47.613 --> 25:49.146
No matter what.
