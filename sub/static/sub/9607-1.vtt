What are you doing?

02:41.834 --> 02:44.792

You're not climbing, are you?

Mrs. Phillips, they've

Just... I'm sorry,
just one second.

02:57.291 --> 02:58.834
Um, sweetie, I'm going
to be a little late.

02:58.834 --> 03:00.166
So I'm going
to need you to...

03:00.166 --> 03:02.458

Surprise.

Good afternoon, Mrs. Phillips.

03:23.667 --> 03:24.959
Nice of you to join us.

03:24.959 --> 03:27.667
Are you aware that
your security company's

03:27.667 --> 03:29.959
deadline for getting
my bank on line

03:29.959 --> 03:31.625
was 23 hours ago?!

03:31.625 --> 03:33.875
Uh... Mr. Brisbane,
I-I did inform you

03:33.875 --> 03:36.125
that due to the age
of the building

03:36.125 --> 03:38.083
that we might encounter...

The primary shareholders

will be here for the opening
of the bank next Friday night.

03:43.125 --> 03:44.625
Mr. Brisbane,
as I have said,

03:44.625 --> 03:45.875
the system will not
have been tested,

03:45.875 --> 03:47.458
and I cannot in any kind
of good conscience...

03:47.458 --> 03:49.166
That party will take place,
Mrs. Phillips,

03:49.166 --> 03:50.959

09:47.834 --> 09:50.333
Only if you want
a very serious answer.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.000

with their hands,

play computer games and stuff?

is do women prefer
Hey, Dad.

only knows stuff about

10:04.500 --> 10:08.542

sensitivity

10:10.041 --> 10:12.000

10:52.375 --> 10:54.250
Okay, okay.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.667
Okay, stop touching.
( sighs  )

10:55.667 --> 10:57.041
Bad touch. Okay.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.417
Hey, stranger.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.708
Not you, too.

11:10.708 --> 11:12.291
Now, this
is a nutritious dinner.

11:12.291 --> 11:14.250
Please,

11:14.250 --> 11:15.583
don't give me a hard time.

11:17.417 --> 11:19.542
We just miss you.

11:19.542 --> 11:21.375
Especially Maddy.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.500
And I don't want to have
to set my alarm

11:26.500 --> 11:27.917
for the middle of the night

11:27.917 --> 11:29.375
just so I can have a date
with my wife.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.583
Would you like to go dancing?

11:33.583 --> 11:35.708
( chuckles  )

11:35.708 --> 11:39.208
( Tom hums, Molly laughs  )

11:43.458 --> 11:44.834
You know, I have to
go back to work.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.583
I can't... I really...
Oh, yeah.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.375
Okay, you have to do this first,
though, okay?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.458
( Molly chuckles  )

11:50.458 --> 11:52.291
( Tom groans  )

11:52.291 --> 11:53.625
Tom, come on,
stop messing around.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.125
I can't hold you up.

11:55.125 --> 11:57.166
I can't... Oh.

11:57.166 --> 11:59.625
Tom, what's going on?

11:59.625 --> 12:00.834
I can't feel my legs.

12:00.834 --> 12:02.291
What?

12:02.291 --> 12:03.375
Where does it hurt?

12:03.375 --> 12:06.458
Tom? Can you hear me?

12:06.458 --> 12:08.959
Tom?! Tom?!

12:13.458 --> 12:15.583
DOCTOR:
The injury probably occurred

12:15.583 --> 12:17.500
during his climbing accident.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.625
Well, there must be something
that you can do.

12:19.625 --> 12:20.917
I mean, isn't there any kind of

12:20.917 --> 12:23.333
emergency surgery
or anything?

12:23.333 --> 12:25.291
There's nothing we can do here.

12:25.291 --> 12:27.458
There is a private medical
facility in Denmark

12:27.458 --> 12:29.625
that has done testing
on this injury.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.500
Okay, then,
let's... let's go, then.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.166
It's considered experimental.

12:34.166 --> 12:35.542
Even though it's been
highly successful...

12:35.542 --> 12:37.250
We'll try any thing.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.375
Your insurance
won't cover it.

12:39.375 --> 12:41.166
How much?

12:41.166 --> 12:42.417
What?

12:42.417 --> 12:43.708
How much does
the surgery cost?

12:43.708 --> 12:45.542
We'll pay for it.

12:45.542 --> 12:47.041
$250,000.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.667
Okay, we... we'll pay it.
Mom...

12:53.667 --> 12:55.834
Tell... Mom, tell her
we'll pay it.

12:55.834 --> 12:57.291
Mom...

12:57.291 --> 13:00.750
we, we, we can pay it.

13:00.750 --> 13:03.542
Mom, tell her
we'll pay it, please?

13:03.542 --> 13:05.667
( crying  )

13:05.667 --> 13:07.542
GUS ( voice-over  ):
$250,000?

13:07.542 --> 13:09.166
Please tell her
we'll pay it.

13:09.166 --> 13:11.333
What happens if your dad
doesn't get the operation?

13:18.667 --> 13:20.708
We'll go door-to-door.

13:20.708 --> 13:23.625
Everyone loves your dad.
They'll give us money.

13:23.625 --> 13:25.458
I can sell my camera.

13:25.458 --> 13:26.542
MADDY:
It's $250,000,

13:26.542 --> 13:28.542
you guys.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.542
You know how much
money that is?

13:30.542 --> 13:32.625
I have a coin collection.

13:32.625 --> 13:34.375
They're rare.

13:42.291 --> 13:46.667
But... Well, what if I,
what if I borrow half,

13:46.667 --> 13:49.542
and then I can make...

13:49.542 --> 13:51.375
No, it doesn't exceed that.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.834
Personal collateral?

13:55.834 --> 14:00.625
Uh... we own a go-cart track.

14:00.625 --> 14:03.041
( sighs  )

14:03.041 --> 14:06.708
Let's cut to the chase,
shall we, Mrs. Phillips?

14:06.708 --> 14:09.750
You're not qualified for
a personal loan of this size.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.500
( Molly sighs  )

14:11.500 --> 14:13.667
I understand, but, uh,
my husband is sick and

14:13.667 --> 14:15.750
I was hoping...

14:15.750 --> 14:18.083
Yes. Yes, I'm aware of that,
Mrs. Phillips.

14:18.083 --> 14:22.250
Doesn't it mean anything
that I work for the bank?

14:22.250 --> 14:24.417
But you're freelance,
aren't you?

14:24.417 --> 14:25.542
Mm-hmm.

14:25.542 --> 14:28.083
From a security company.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.375
A security company, which,
under your guidance,

14:34.375 --> 14:36.792
has been unable
to provide my bank

14:36.792 --> 14:39.458
with a fully operational
security system

14:39.458 --> 14:40.667
in the allotted time

14:40.667 --> 14:43.166
stated in the contract.

14:45.375 --> 14:47.417
MOLLY:
Come on.

14:47.417 --> 14:49.250
Come on.

14:56.375 --> 14:58.333
Don't you have a heart?

14:58.333 --> 15:02.625
This is not an emotional issue,
Mrs. Phillips.

15:02.625 --> 15:05.625
A bank has no heart.

15:05.625 --> 15:09.083
Only paper in a vault.

15:15.959 --> 15:17.792
TOM ( voice-over  ):
Strange not being able to move.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.625
I've been staring
at the same spot

15:20.625 --> 15:23.792
on the ceiling
for the past three hours.

15:23.792 --> 15:26.500
Mom can't come up
with the money, Dad.

15:26.500 --> 15:30.041
I escaped death
on that climb, Maddy.

15:32.125 --> 15:35.917
20 feet from the summit,
my gear stuck,

15:35.917 --> 15:38.875
but there was this, this perfect
crack all the way up to the top.

15:38.875 --> 15:41.625
You free-climbed it?

15:41.625 --> 15:42.917
It was so easy.

15:42.917 --> 15:46.333
I lost concentration,
and I fell.

15:46.333 --> 15:47.959
But somebody or something
was looking out for me,

15:47.959 --> 15:50.834
so I could go home,
see you,

15:50.834 --> 15:54.667
get to know
what a great girl you are.

15:54.667 --> 15:56.917
In a way, that fall

15:56.917 --> 15:58.834
was the best thing that could
have happened to me.

16:01.708 --> 16:03.917
You know I'd do anything
for you.

16:03.917 --> 16:07.125
Dad, we'll come up
with the money. I promise.

16:07.125 --> 16:09.625
CD-ROM NARRATOR:
...and lined it with

16:09.625 --> 16:12.875
a 200-foot-high steel chamber,
which houses the Lion Safe.

16:12.875 --> 16:15.542
The system combines
the best of new technology

16:15.542 --> 16:17.792
and old, tried-and-true
security methods,

16:17.792 --> 16:20.708
making Harderbach Financial
the most secure a bank

16:20.708 --> 16:22.542
can be.
The entire system

16:22.542 --> 16:24.667
is run on a tri-generator,

16:24.667 --> 16:26.500
making power loss
a virtual impossibility,

16:26.500 --> 16:29.041
meaning the system
would remain safe

16:29.041 --> 16:31.583
even in the event
of a citywide blackout.

16:31.583 --> 16:34.458
The project began in the fall
of 2000 and is the largest,

16:34.458 --> 16:36.708
most technologically advanced
security install

16:36.708 --> 16:39.500
to date for any bank
in North America.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.542
The halls are lined
with hundreds

16:41.542 --> 16:43.583
of motion-sensitive cameras
whose images are fed back

16:43.583 --> 16:45.166
to a state-of-the-art
security booth.

16:45.166 --> 16:47.250
Until the system
has been fully tested,

16:47.250 --> 16:49.000
the halls will be patrolled
after-hours

16:49.000 --> 16:51.708
by highly trained attack dogs.

16:51.708 --> 16:53.917
This all leads to the Lion Safe.
The safe

16:53.917 --> 16:56.917
is suspended
nearly 100 feet off the ground

16:56.917 --> 16:59.375
and is equipped to hold over
$25 million

16:59.375 --> 17:01.250
in cash and gold bullion.

17:01.250 --> 17:03.375
Safety deposit boxes
line the walls of this chamber.

17:03.375 --> 17:05.583
Slated to be finished
in April of 2004...

17:05.583 --> 17:06.834
GUS:
Are you crazy?

17:06.834 --> 17:08.750
Oh, come on.
We can't rob a bank.

17:08.750 --> 17:10.750
We'll pay them back.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.583
How?

17:12.583 --> 17:13.916
I don't know.
I'll work. I'll do anything.

17:13.916 --> 17:15.375
You understand what

17:15.375 --> 17:16.625
happens if we get caught,
right?

17:16.625 --> 17:18.583
We go to jail forever.

17:18.583 --> 17:20.959
Like, until we're 21.

17:20.959 --> 17:23.625
No one will ever suspect us.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.458
Adults treat us like
we're five years old, anyway.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.583
How hard could it be?

17:27.583 --> 17:29.041
( voice-over  ):
Tomorrow, I'll go to work

17:29.041 --> 17:30.792
with my mom
and check out the bank.

17:30.792 --> 17:32.875
Meanwhile, Gus,

17:32.875 --> 17:34.959
you need to find out who
the architect is of the bank

17:34.959 --> 17:36.917
and see if you can get
a floor plan or a model.

17:36.917 --> 17:38.417
And, Austin,

17:38.417 --> 17:40.708
Austin'll take care of the dogs.

17:40.708 --> 17:42.583
What dogs?

17:42.583 --> 17:44.500
Rottweilers.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.041
Vicious killing dogs.

17:46.041 --> 17:49.041
MADDY:
Gus, come on.
This is serious.

17:49.041 --> 17:51.542
Tomorrow at the bank,
I'll try to check out
my mom's security system.

17:51.542 --> 17:53.792
GUARD:
Good morning, Mrs. Phillips.

17:53.792 --> 17:55.708
Who's that in the
car with you today?
MOLLY: It's my daughter.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.959
MADDY:
I'll try to take
as many pictures as I can.

17:57.959 --> 18:00.041
( shutter clicks  )

18:00.041 --> 18:02.166
You guys, I really need you.

18:03.959 --> 18:05.708
GUS:
All right.

18:05.708 --> 18:07.834
For Mr. P.

18:07.834 --> 18:09.208
For your dad.

18:13.041 --> 18:16.041
MOLLY:
Okay, Maddy, here we go.

18:17.959 --> 18:19.125
Maddy?

18:26.667 --> 18:28.208
( indistinct conversation  )

18:30.083 --> 18:32.041
( click  )

18:36.667 --> 18:37.542
( click  )

18:39.208 --> 18:41.333
( sighs  )

18:46.917 --> 18:49.000
( sniffs  )

18:54.542 --> 18:56.583
Do you have any idea
how fast you were going?

18:56.583 --> 18:57.625
Save it, pal.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.542
License and registration.

19:04.959 --> 19:09.041
That is the eye of God, Chad.

19:09.041 --> 19:10.834
Do you see these people?

19:10.834 --> 19:12.166
These are not people.

19:12.166 --> 19:14.208
These are

19:14.208 --> 19:17.041
snakes in paradise waiting
for your weakest moment.

19:17.041 --> 19:19.875
Any chance you give them.

19:19.875 --> 19:21.667
These people?

19:21.667 --> 19:22.708
Not to be trusted.

19:25.583 --> 19:26.834
Oh!

19:26.834 --> 19:29.250
My sweethearts.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.208
MOLLY:
Maddy?

19:31.208 --> 19:32.542
I love that you wanted

19:32.542 --> 19:33.959
to come to work with me
today, sweetheart,

19:33.959 --> 19:35.417
but I have a lot of work to do.

19:35.417 --> 19:37.000
So I kind of need you
to keep up, okay?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.083
Can I see the safe?

19:38.083 --> 19:39.208
That's just the old safe.

19:39.208 --> 19:40.708
The real one's upstairs.

19:40.708 --> 19:43.041
What are those?

19:43.041 --> 19:44.083
That's a motion detector.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.708
Can I see the new safe?

19:45.708 --> 19:48.041
And, if Miss Fancy-Pants
Phillips over there

19:48.041 --> 19:50.083
would've listened to me

19:50.083 --> 19:53.375
we wouldn't need all this
high-tech flim-flammery.

19:53.375 --> 19:57.542
The dogs...!
( dogs whimpering  )

19:57.542 --> 20:00.083
...the dogs would have done
all the work.

20:00.083 --> 20:03.583
The dogs and my black belt.

20:07.083 --> 20:09.583
( martial arts yells  )

20:09.583 --> 20:11.959
( back cracking, groans  )

20:11.959 --> 20:14.000
Back to the monitor,
maggot!

20:14.000 --> 20:16.250
Your office upstairs?

20:16.250 --> 20:18.041
Yeah. I need to be
near the safe.

20:18.041 --> 20:19.291
( whirring  )

20:19.291 --> 20:20.917
Whoa.

20:20.917 --> 20:22.792
That thing looks
like it's alive.

20:22.792 --> 20:25.166
MOLLY:
It's got a built-in motion
detector.

20:25.166 --> 20:27.417
I mean, the guards can't watch
all hundred cameras at
the same time,

20:27.417 --> 20:29.959
so when the camera
picks up movement,
then the light goes on

20:29.959 --> 20:31.291
and they can see us.

20:31.291 --> 20:33.250
Watch. Just stay
completely still.

20:36.166 --> 20:37.625
CHAD:
Ah, climber girl.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.291
That's pretty cool.

20:45.291 --> 20:46.583
( elevator bell dings  )

20:52.792 --> 20:54.750
HARTMANN:
Well, they better fix

20:54.750 --> 20:57.000
the ISP, 'cause that whole
side of the building is S.O.L.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.750
Molly...Oh.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.250
I didn't think
you were coming in today.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.792
Oh, well, the party is Friday,

21:02.792 --> 21:05.250
so I wanted to make sure the
system is as close as possible.

21:05.250 --> 21:08.583
Yeah. Listen, uh, I spoke
with Brisbane about the loan,

21:08.583 --> 21:11.333
and he just wouldn't budge.
I'm really sorry.

21:11.333 --> 21:14.500
MOLLY:
Oh, God. Well, we'll have
to figure out some other way.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.291
Would you like a tour?
MOLLY:
Oh, Alan, that's really...

21:17.291 --> 21:19.000
Yeah! That'd be awesome.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.583
Well, great.
We'll start this way.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.375
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of her.

21:22.375 --> 21:24.083
Take care of that for me,
would you?

21:24.083 --> 21:25.041
Now, we're going
to begin...

21:30.959 --> 21:32.333
MAN:
I paid that phone bill!

21:32.333 --> 21:35.208
I paid that phone bill
last week!

21:37.917 --> 21:40.375
Hi.
My name's Austin.

21:40.375 --> 21:42.542
Easy!

21:42.542 --> 21:45.375
My name's Austin, and, uh,
I make movies... director.

21:45.375 --> 21:48.375
Really?

21:48.375 --> 21:50.500
How may I help you?

21:50.500 --> 21:52.667
Okay, I got this dog
for my birthday.

21:52.667 --> 21:54.625
And I was hoping I could
use him as a stunt dog--

21:54.625 --> 21:56.125
What kind of dog do you have?

21:56.125 --> 21:57.875
A Budweiser?

21:57.875 --> 21:59.875
Rottweiler?

21:59.875 --> 22:01.583
Yeah.

22:01.583 --> 22:03.959
I just happen to be
a Rottweiler expert.

22:03.959 --> 22:07.834
There is a really nice boy here
who's going to write an essay

22:07.834 --> 22:09.375
about the design of the

22:09.375 --> 22:12.375
Harderbach Financial
building,

22:12.375 --> 22:14.792
and he needs
a floor-plan drawing

22:14.792 --> 22:18.291
that he can use
as a visual aid for his essay.

22:18.291 --> 22:20.083
MAN:
Are you freakin' nuts?!

22:20.083 --> 22:22.792
You can't give bank
floor plans to a kid!

22:22.792 --> 22:24.792
You're just...!

22:24.792 --> 22:28.542
Normally, he's very nice.

22:28.542 --> 22:29.959
But it's a little more
difficult with banks.

22:29.959 --> 22:31.875
I mean,

22:31.875 --> 22:34.041
imagine if you were
a bank robber.

22:34.041 --> 22:35.250
( laughs  )

22:35.250 --> 22:37.542
( weak chuckle  )

22:37.542 --> 22:40.417
It's just that last time
I got a C on my essay because

22:40.417 --> 22:42.083
I didn't have
any visual aids.

22:42.083 --> 22:43.291
And my stepdad, he...

22:43.291 --> 22:47.417
well, he gets a little...

22:47.417 --> 22:50.458

Oh...

22:54.083 --> 22:56.250
You stay here.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.917
HARTMANN:
I know you can't see it now,

23:09.917 --> 23:12.000
but by the party, we
are hoping it's primo.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.458
And down here is
the security room.

23:14.458 --> 23:16.250
Ultra high-tech and cool.
Your mom designed that, too.

23:16.250 --> 23:17.792
( polite laugh  )

23:17.792 --> 23:19.792
You might notice the keypads,
which are designed

23:19.792 --> 23:23.208
to keep people out of the
important areas of the bank.

23:23.208 --> 23:24.291
Who has the codes to all these?

23:24.291 --> 23:26.125
Oh, uh, they're different

23:26.125 --> 23:27.250
from room to room.

23:27.250 --> 23:29.291
But, uh, I have a code

23:29.291 --> 23:30.959
that is good
for the whole building.

23:30.959 --> 23:32.458
Cool.

23:32.458 --> 23:33.667
Come on.

23:40.125 --> 23:43.500
D-E-N-I-R-O.

23:43.500 --> 23:46.125
"Deniro."

23:49.959 --> 23:53.667
Oh, look at that view.

23:53.667 --> 23:55.834
This is the coolest office
in the building.

23:55.834 --> 23:58.083
It belongs to the big cheese,
Mr. Brisbane.

23:58.083 --> 23:59.458
Check this out.

23:59.458 --> 24:00.917
( keyboard clicks  )

24:00.917 --> 24:02.041
Huh?

24:02.041 --> 24:04.250
Huh? Huh, and get this:

24:04.250 --> 24:06.375
Your mom has rigged it

24:06.375 --> 24:09.000
so you can control all
the cameras from right here.

24:11.333 --> 24:12.875
( imitating De Niro  ):
You talking to me?

24:12.875 --> 24:15.250
Huh?

24:15.250 --> 24:16.166
Are you talking to me?

24:19.166 --> 24:20.250
It's De Niro.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.041
I still do some acting.

24:22.041 --> 24:24.375
This bank manager thing
is just temporary.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.041
Hey, come on. You try it.

24:26.041 --> 24:27.041
Uh...

24:28.875 --> 24:30.834
I don't know what to say.

24:30.834 --> 24:33.041
Say anything.

24:33.041 --> 24:34.041
Hi.

24:34.041 --> 24:35.875

HARTMANN:
In this room there's a tunnel

24:50.917 --> 24:52.542
that leads to the safe.

24:52.542 --> 24:54.333
I can only tell you a little bit
about the safe.

24:54.333 --> 24:56.375
Only your mom understands
the whole thing.

24:56.375 --> 24:57.917
I mean, after all,
she designed it.

24:57.917 --> 24:58.959

24:58.959 --> 25:01.291
Oh, no! Look out.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.583
( panting  )

25:03.583 --> 25:05.417
I can't wait until we
get rid of these things.

25:05.417 --> 25:06.542
They get me every time.

25:06.542 --> 25:08.250
Down!

25:08.250 --> 25:11.625

56:04.375 --> 56:06.083
Well!

56:06.083 --> 56:07.875
It seems that our
security system works.

56:07.875 --> 56:09.041
( laughing  )

56:09.041 --> 56:11.041
Yes.

56:11.041 --> 56:12.875
It's just a false alarm,
everyone, so why don't

56:12.875 --> 56:15.834
we all just relax and enjoy
this wonderful party,

56:15.834 --> 56:17.083
what do you
say?Sure.

56:17.083 --> 56:18.875
Wonderful. Please.

56:18.875 --> 56:20.250
( applause  )

56:20.250 --> 56:21.500
Something's
going on here.

56:21.500 --> 56:24.250
I'm going to find out
what it is.

56:24.250 --> 56:25.417
( yelling  )

56:25.417 --> 56:26.959
The monitor!

56:32.959 --> 56:36.792
( breathing deeply  )

56:36.792 --> 56:38.500
I can do this.

56:44.375 --> 56:48.166
( clinking  )

56:48.166 --> 56:49.291
Maddy, be careful.

56:56.125 --> 56:57.291
( grunts  )

57:00.500 --> 57:03.792
( clinking  )

57:03.792 --> 57:05.166
Maddy, my parents
grounded me for a week

57:05.166 --> 57:07.125
when I left my bike outside.

57:07.125 --> 57:09.041
Imagine what they'll do
if they catch us now.

57:12.166 --> 57:13.500
We'll figure out
a different way.

57:13.500 --> 57:14.542
It's too dangerous.

57:16.500 --> 57:17.917
She's not listening to me.

57:17.917 --> 57:19.500
She clearly doesn't understand.

57:19.500 --> 57:21.333
She's climbing up
this stupid wall and...

57:21.333 --> 57:23.041
Austin, maybe
she'd listen to you.

57:23.041 --> 57:25.083
AUSTIN ( over radio  ):
That would be a first.

57:25.083 --> 57:26.250
GUS:
I wonder if you can

57:26.250 --> 57:27.542
finish the eighth grade
in prison.

57:31.375 --> 57:33.208
Oh, wait-- if we're in jail,

57:33.208 --> 57:35.041
our parents
can't ground us, right?

57:42.500 --> 57:45.291
( gasping  )

57:45.291 --> 57:47.041
No...

57:49.583 --> 57:52.083
Come on, this cannot
be happening.

57:52.083 --> 57:54.041
The cam's stuck.

57:54.041 --> 57:55.375
It's stuck.

57:57.667 --> 57:59.208
TOM'S VOICE:
20 feet from the summit,

57:59.208 --> 58:01.375
my gear stuck.

58:01.375 --> 58:03.375
There was this perfect crack

58:03.375 --> 58:05.375
running all the way
up to the top.

58:09.917 --> 58:11.583
He free-climbed it.

58:20.291 --> 58:22.834
( grunts  )

58:22.834 --> 58:27.500
Maddy, are you
free-climbing this?!

58:27.500 --> 58:29.291
Maddy, no!

58:32.208 --> 58:35.625
( grunting  )

58:35.625 --> 58:37.041
Maddy, we never
even got to kiss.

58:45.291 --> 58:48.875
( grunting  )

58:53.959 --> 58:57.083
( grunting, panting  )

59:03.291 --> 59:05.250
( gasps  )

59:05.250 --> 59:08.083
( grunting  )

59:10.375 --> 59:12.125
( gasping  )

59:18.125 --> 59:19.458
( metal creaking  )

59:19.458 --> 59:21.291
( Maddy grunting  )

59:21.291 --> 59:23.458
( panting  )

59:23.458 --> 59:26.000
( metal creaking  )

59:31.458 --> 59:32.458
( grunting  )

59:34.291 --> 59:35.667
( grunting  )

59:45.000 --> 59:48.417
( panting  )

59:48.417 --> 59:49.667
She's looking down.

59:49.667 --> 59:51.250
She's looking down!

59:51.250 --> 59:52.500
Tell her not to!

59:52.500 --> 59:54.375
Oh, why did I look down?

59:54.375 --> 59:55.458
That's high.

59:55.458 --> 59:57.208
Maddy, don't look down!

59:59.333 --> 01:00:01.083
Oh, that's high.

01:00:01.083 --> 01:00:02.291
It's not high.

01:00:02.291 --> 01:00:03.583
I can do it.

01:00:03.583 --> 01:00:06.500
( breathes deeply  )

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.458
Gus looks like an ant.

01:00:07.458 --> 01:00:08.500
( grunts  )

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.959
Okay...

01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:14.542
( grunts  )

01:00:16.166 --> 01:00:19.041
Okay...

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:21.166
One...

01:00:21.166 --> 01:00:22.625
Two...

01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:26.708
...Two and a half...

01:00:29.542 --> 01:00:31.083
Maddy, no!

01:00:31.083 --> 01:00:32.625
...Three!

01:00:32.625 --> 01:00:34.542
( grunts  )

01:00:34.542 --> 01:00:35.083
( gasps  )
Whoa!

01:00:37.417 --> 01:00:38.750
Maddy!
( grunts  )

01:00:41.708 --> 01:00:43.041
Gus?
( panting  )

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.208
( beeping  )

01:00:47.208 --> 01:00:48.542
Oh, no.

01:00:48.542 --> 01:00:50.875
She set off a timer, Gus.

01:00:50.875 --> 01:00:52.125
She has two minutes
to enter the code

01:00:52.125 --> 01:00:53.375
before the alarm goes off.

01:00:53.375 --> 01:00:54.542
Maddy, you've
triggered the timer.

01:00:54.542 --> 01:00:55.625
You've got to reach the keypad.

01:00:55.625 --> 01:00:57.208
( beeping  )

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.542

De Niro's
not the code?!

01:01:28.166 --> 01:01:29.500
I can't
believe it.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.291
( beeping  )

01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:33.208
I can't break
the access code, Maddy.

01:01:33.208 --> 01:01:34.208
( beeping  )

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:36.166
Your mom designed

01:01:36.166 --> 01:01:37.625
the safe, so the code
must be something she chose.

01:01:37.625 --> 01:01:40.166
What could it be?

01:01:40.166 --> 01:01:41.583

01:01:43.625 --> 01:01:45.083

01:01:56.458 --> 01:01:59.291
Come on, Maddy.

01:02:02.625 --> 01:02:04.625
Oh, what could it be?

01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:07.125
Mom, what did you use?

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:11.333
Dad.

What happened?

01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:14.708
GUS:
She made it. She's in the safe.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.375

head of security.

This is all her fault!
Actually, Mr. Brisbane...

01:16:24.125 --> 01:16:26.959
Mr. Brisbane,
with all due respect, Molly did
tell you

01:16:26.959 --> 01:16:29.500
that the security system
had not been tested.

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.708
Really? Well, you just
got your walking papers,
didn't you, Hartmann?

01:16:33.417 --> 01:16:34.708
Are you talkin' to me?

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:38.875
Are you talkin' to me?!

01:16:38.875 --> 01:16:40.542
Well, you must be talkin' to me,

01:16:40.542 --> 01:16:42.417
'cause there's nobody else here!

01:16:42.417 --> 01:16:44.125
So you must be talkin' to me!

Excuse me.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.458
Monsieur Nuffaut,
I must apologize

01:16:54.458 --> 01:16:56.917
for this strange debacle.
I assure you...

01:16:56.917 --> 01:16:58.333
( French accent  ):
It's not me

01:16:58.333 --> 01:17:00.083
you owe an apology
to, Brisban-ee.

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:02.834
Of course, uh, if
the head of security

01:17:02.834 --> 01:17:05.041
told you the system
is not ready,

01:17:05.041 --> 01:17:07.834
then it seems like,
uh, how do you say,

01:17:07.834 --> 01:17:11.542
a knucklehead move to go
ahead with this soiree.

01:17:11.542 --> 01:17:13.417
Je suis desole, madame.

01:17:13.417 --> 01:17:14.542

Details are sketchy,

had robbed Harderbach Financial

of nearly a quarter
million dollars.

01:20:47.625 --> 01:20:49.834
And a source inside the bank
is saying the robbery

01:20:49.834 --> 01:20:51.500
was actually some type of plot

has a father

of an operation.

been identified,
