01:10.400 --> 01:13.200
- Hey. Marcus, welcome.
- Hello. Good to see you, Freddy.

01:13.360 --> 01:16.160
- Good to see you too, man.
- Thank you for having me.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.240
Thanks for coming.

01:18.880 --> 01:22.200
- You live in the city, right?
- Yeah, I live in Soho still.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.960
I have not been out here
in a very, very long time.

01:26.120 --> 01:30.360
- I had an old friend that lived...
- Welcome. This is home.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.160
- It's a jungle.
- I know, right?

01:34.320 --> 01:38.720
It's my boyfriend's obsession.
He gets one every other day.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.880
Yeah, you want some coffee, water?

01:41.040 --> 01:43.520
- Water. Water would be great.
- Okay.

01:46.480 --> 01:48.400
- Here.
- Nice yard. Thank you.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.880
This is my cat, Sula.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.480
I'm a little allergic.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.360
- Oh, sorry.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

01:54.520 --> 01:55.600
Sula.

01:55.760 --> 01:59.760
So, yeah, now, like,
this is where I live and work.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.320
- I don't really...
- Jennifer.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.680
- Oh, yeah. Jennifer Aniston.
- You're a fan?

02:03.840 --> 02:06.320
No. Come on, it's a joke.
She looks so beige.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.759
- She is beige.
- Right? She looks like bread.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.760
Yes, and I was telling you
I don't need that much space anymore...

02:13.920 --> 02:17.320
- ...so that's why...
- God. What space, Freddy.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.640
Look what you can do with space.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.520
There you are.

02:21.680 --> 02:25.600
And where are you going?
What are you doing going into video?

02:25.760 --> 02:28.840
- No, but it's not like an extreme decision.
- What is this?

02:29.000 --> 02:32.280
I just... When you told me
about this group show, it just felt...

02:32.440 --> 02:35.640
kind of like a great opportunity
to explore that subject.

02:35.800 --> 02:40.160
Tell me why is Dirty Baby right
for identity and heritage?

02:40.320 --> 02:41.720
- Why? How?
- It's Nasty Baby.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.800
Nasty Baby. Oh, that's much better.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.640
- It's better, right?
- Much better.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.920
- Yeah.
- It's more catchy, but I feel that...

02:48.080 --> 02:50.520
So I've been trying to make a baby...

02:50.680 --> 02:53.280
with my best friend
for the last six months.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.520
And so since we start
I've been obsessed with the idea...

02:56.640 --> 02:59.480
that there's gonna be a creature
that resembles me...

02:59.640 --> 03:01.600
and is made out of my genes.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.000
And, like, it's...
It's such a selfish act...

03:04.160 --> 03:06.840
to keep making babies.
There's many you can adopt.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
But you want it.

03:08.160 --> 03:10.400
- Now I want to. Now I want to.
- You want it.

03:10.560 --> 03:14.880
And then I feel so guilty about it
that I feel that I need to pay a price.

03:15.040 --> 03:18.720
And the price is to go through
the embarrassment...

03:18.880 --> 03:23.080
- ...of me portraying a 3-month-old baby.
- I love that one.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.840
Yeah, so these are pictures of me...

03:26.000 --> 03:27.760
- ...when I was a baby.
- That's you?

03:27.920 --> 03:29.240
When I was a nasty baby.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.280
Yeah, like, go back to this time,
you know...

03:32.440 --> 03:35.640
and portray
this sort of, like, gross cuteness.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.880
Tell me, if we were to...
If you were done...

03:39.040 --> 03:43.840
and we were pulling up tomorrow
to load in at this show, what am I seeing?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.560
So I'll be fully naked...

03:45.720 --> 03:47.600
- ...against a black background.
- Okay.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.080
Like a black infinite background,
performing...

03:50.240 --> 03:53.040
I can show you. It's really embarrassing.
It's part of...

03:53.200 --> 03:55.360
- You wanna get ready, or...?
- No, no, no.

03:55.520 --> 03:59.280
No, I'm not gonna get naked now.
Yeah, but I'll show you how it is.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.120
- I'm ready.
- Okay, I'm ready too.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.080
You're never ready for this, but...

04:03.200 --> 04:06.080
Okay, so basically...

04:06.240 --> 04:08.520
Okay, imagine
if black infinite background...

04:08.640 --> 04:10.520
no music at all, super raw.

04:10.680 --> 04:14.720
And then, on video,
doing something like this:

05:11.160 --> 05:13.520
Put your left hand up. Left hand.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.560
- How you doing?
- Fine.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.920
- How's your camel toe hanging?
- It's good.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.480
How's your loose butthole?

05:19.840 --> 05:21.400
You got it.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.160
- There's no place...
- You do...

05:24.640 --> 05:26.200
Here. This one's so easy.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.840
- Yes!
- Oh, my God!

05:28.000 --> 05:29.480
Yeah!

05:29.760 --> 05:31.640
- You're almost there.
- Yeah!

05:32.440 --> 05:33.480
Wait.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.160
I have to touch it. I have to touch it.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.280
You guys had a clearing?

05:41.440 --> 05:42.640
I'm so proud of you.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.200
I'm so...

05:48.520 --> 05:50.200
Be careful.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.520
Mom, look. Mom.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.200
Shit.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.960
I'm getting better now.

06:15.760 --> 06:20.000
I had this meeting with this gallery,
and I promise this is what I showed him.

06:22.880 --> 06:27.640
I was, like, rolling around
like a disgusting baby.

06:29.560 --> 06:30.760
Funny, right?

06:30.880 --> 06:32.520
It's funny.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.880
I just got an e-mail from my doctor.

06:36.040 --> 06:39.440
Your sperm count is lower than we thought.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.040
- So...
- Oh, no.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.040
It's not gonna work.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.520
It's kind of why it hasn't been working.

06:47.720 --> 06:49.200
- I know. I'm sorry.
- It sucks.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.440
- No, it's...
- I'm sorry I wasted your time.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.920
We tried like five months
with my lousy semen.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.640
It's not lousy, it's just not...

06:55.800 --> 06:57.080
- Low. Low.
- It's just low.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.400
So, yeah. Now we just have to try
to figure out the next step...

07:00.560 --> 07:03.760
- What is the next step, though?
- Your brother? I'm just kidding.

07:03.920 --> 07:04.960
Chino? That's gross.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.000
- Because he's young, maybe his...
- Yeah, amazing cum.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.320
What about Mo?

07:12.400 --> 07:15.480
Mo is... It's always been an option.
I mean, like, he knows.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.320
He's waiting for the results too.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.240
Yeah. So you'll talk to him?

07:19.360 --> 07:20.960
Yeah, I'll talk to him.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.360
Today?

07:22.560 --> 07:23.680
- Today? Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.480
I just wanna get it done.
I wanna keep moving.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.920
- Try for the next time you're ovulating?
- Yeah, why not?

07:33.520 --> 07:34.760
Oh, boy.

07:34.880 --> 07:35.960
I'm gonna go change.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.480
Should we, like, leave?

07:37.640 --> 07:38.800
- Yeah, let's go.
- Okay.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.480
- I can't get out. I can't get out.
- What do you mean? What?

07:43.080 --> 07:45.800
Oh, my gosh. Freddy, please, help me!

07:45.920 --> 07:48.040
Oh, sorry, no, I was just kidding.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.680
- I know.
- Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

07:59.840 --> 08:00.960
I know. It's okay.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.280
I don't wanna cry over it.
It just, like...

08:03.440 --> 08:09.160
So, basically, Polly said
that if you could...

08:10.240 --> 08:15.440
If you could decide soon whether
you wanna be the next sperm donor...

08:15.600 --> 08:18.760
How...? How soon?

08:20.160 --> 08:22.960
- She said tonight, but she didn't...
- She said tonight?

08:23.120 --> 08:26.800
Tonight that I ask you,
not that we tell her.

08:27.520 --> 08:31.240
Whatever. I think she wants to do it
before the next ovulation period...

08:31.400 --> 08:33.760
which is within two weeks. Is that crazy?

08:34.159 --> 08:36.440
Is this...?
Why are you feeling so hesitant?

08:36.600 --> 08:39.919
I don't feel hesitant. It's not...
I'm not against it, against...

08:40.080 --> 08:43.159
- I just don't wanna be rushed.
- It'd be amazing if you could.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.280
Some people can't.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.720
I have to think about it, but...

08:49.880 --> 08:52.120
And I will tell her maybe...

08:52.280 --> 08:54.800
- Tell her to...
- Before she ovulates again?

08:54.960 --> 08:57.440
- Tell her that she will ovulate again.
- She...

08:57.600 --> 08:59.400
- Eventually.
- Eventually. It's not...

08:59.560 --> 09:01.240
- I know, I know. I know.
- Yo, Cor.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.400
- Hey.
- How are you?

09:02.560 --> 09:05.880
May I ask you how much
the three ivies in the front are?

09:06.040 --> 09:07.160
Those are 25.

09:07.320 --> 09:10.240
Twenty-five, all three of them?
The one on the end?

09:22.880 --> 09:24.920
Oh, it's so painful.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.720
It's so painful. Look at them, dude.

09:29.440 --> 09:32.960
- I've been one of those couples.
- Really? Complaining about food?

09:33.120 --> 09:36.320
- Just, like, the awkward dinner shit.
- The super silent, like...

09:37.160 --> 09:39.320
Never bring me here again.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.040
Oh, no, I wanna rescue
that poor woman, dude.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.840
Dude, this plant is heavy.
Why am I carrying it?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.320
- You're so strong.
- Thank you, baby.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.160
You got it.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.000
Hey, Richard.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.320
- Help is here.
- Let us do it. Let us do it.

09:56.480 --> 09:59.840
Wait a second.
Did you see that guy going up the street?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.760
- What guy?
- That... What guy?

10:01.920 --> 10:03.360
That miserable bastard.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.160
- He's some kind of homeless person.
- What happened?

10:06.320 --> 10:09.400
I don't wanna get into it.
He bullshitted me out of a dollar.

10:09.560 --> 10:12.200
- Just now?
- Yes, just when I parked.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.200
He pretended to be helping me,
and that was all bullshit.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.400
If you help me get the apples
out of the vehicle...

10:18.560 --> 10:22.400
I will give you a wonderful libation
when we get inside.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.380
- Can I just put these here?
- Anywhere you can.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.300
I appreciate your help. Freddy.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.140
- Hank, go inside, go inside.
- Where'd you go?

10:30.240 --> 10:33.080
I was lugging the bags. Babe, your plant.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.800
I'm going to make us gin and tonic.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.360
One, one.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.040
"Mayor of Adelphi Street"?

10:41.200 --> 10:43.520
Yes. The mayor of Adelphi Street.

10:43.680 --> 10:47.400
- I could've been the governor.
- Fritz looks really cute in this picture.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.400
- He was a beautiful, beautiful man.
- Did you see this?

10:50.560 --> 10:53.840
Let me give you a little squeeze.
You'll like it. Here's another.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.160
Thank you.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.240
Go ahead. Here's yours.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.560
Okay.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.760
And let's drink to your future, guys.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.800
- I'm an old guy. I have a past.
- Cheers. Yes, you do.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.640
- To my past.
- Right there, framed.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.880
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.640
- I'm the Ghost of Christmas Past.
- Yes, you are.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.760
What are you doing?

11:21.680 --> 11:23.120
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck?!

11:23.280 --> 11:25.000
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Get out!

11:25.120 --> 11:26.400
Get out.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.000
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I was just shaving.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.560
Why the fuck does he have keys
to the house?

11:30.720 --> 11:33.120
Well, because we'd agreed
that that was a good idea.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.640
Dude, you need to let us know
when you are coming.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.640
Just shaving. I came for my guitar.
Can I finish in your room?

11:38.800 --> 11:39.760
Okay, but clean up.

11:39.920 --> 11:40.880
Okay.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.960
- Sorry, brother.
- It's okay, next time just tell us.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.840
It's your mom. Picking up.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.720
Cecilia.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.760
Yeah, it's me.

11:55.720 --> 11:56.720
Yeah, not so good.

11:57.600 --> 12:01.560
Yeah, I found out
I'm not gonna be able to be a dad.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.760
Yeah, I know. Yeah, exactly.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.400
Why don't you help me?

12:06.560 --> 12:09.680
Babe, your mom wants to talk to you
no matter what.

12:09.840 --> 12:10.800
Sorry, guys.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.480
Say hi to Polly.

12:12.960 --> 12:13.920
See you.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.720
Hi, Mama.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.400
I'm good. How are you?

12:19.040 --> 12:20.600
Yeah.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.520
Yeah, it was sad. He's sad about it.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.400
Oh, no, I haven't decided anything yet.

12:28.560 --> 12:32.760
She's more of Freddy's friend,
you know, than mine.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.160
Yeah.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.960
Well, I'm gonna take the test.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.800
Yeah, just to see if... Just to see.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.280
- Hi.
- Guess what, amiga.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.040
Mo said yes.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.440
What?

12:56.600 --> 12:59.440
- Really? He said yes?
- Yeah, he wants to...

12:59.600 --> 13:00.760
I didn't say yes.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.400
- Just tell her.
- Hey, Polly.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.960
So...

13:05.960 --> 13:09.440
Yeah, so you're gonna do it?
Is that...? Is that right?

13:10.480 --> 13:14.920
- I'll definitely go for the test, yeah.
- Oh, the sample. Okay, yeah.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.760
Great. Thank you. That's...

13:19.840 --> 13:21.560
Tomorrow, is tomorrow good? Let's...

13:21.720 --> 13:23.600
Should we just do it tomorrow?

13:23.800 --> 13:25.840
Yeah, meet me at the clinic in Fulton.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.320
Okay, you know what? I have to run
because Chino's here. Okay.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.200
- Hi.
- Hello there.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.520
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.680
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

13:40.240 --> 13:44.360
True love will find you in the end

13:44.480 --> 13:47.840
- So this is G. You know it, right?
- G. Yeah, I think so.

13:48.640 --> 13:53.000
And you'll find out Just who's your friend

13:53.160 --> 13:55.120
- It's confusing.
- Oh, this is G now.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.320
Okay.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.760
I wish I could get you pregnant.
It'd be so easy.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.320
You'd look so cute too.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.480
That's what you want?

14:11.360 --> 14:14.160
- That's gross. Maybe not.
- That's... Yes. Disgusting.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.360
That's kind of gross, yeah.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.000
Turn the light off, get some rest.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.960
Yeah, I'm not even reading, dude.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.280
Dude, what the fuck?

15:24.600 --> 15:26.080
What?

15:29.680 --> 15:30.920
What are you doing, man?

15:32.880 --> 15:34.680
- Hey, dude!
- Freddy.

15:34.840 --> 15:37.520
- What? Dude, it's 7 in the morning.
- Yeah, exactly.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.680
The fuck. Dude, it's 7 in the morning.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.640
That shit's not even legal!

15:42.400 --> 15:43.800
Hey!

15:51.200 --> 15:52.320
Fuck, man.

15:52.480 --> 15:55.040
Just put your ear plugs in.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.280
Fuck, I don't have any left.

16:01.480 --> 16:02.640
Motherfucker!

16:02.800 --> 16:06.760
- Baby, just breathe.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

16:07.320 --> 16:08.480
This is an opportunity.

16:08.640 --> 16:11.480
Just use this as an opportunity
to calm down.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.080
Okay, I know, I know, I know.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.960
You're gonna drive yourself fucking crazy.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.440
- Come on, it's a joke.
- I talked to him.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.920
- He's gonna feel pressured.
- Making a big deal.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.079
- It's funny.
- He's gonna feel pressured.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.680
That's okay. Excuse me.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.960
She wants to take a picture
with me and Arthur, you mind?

17:23.119 --> 17:25.119
- It's gonna be quick.
- Sure. It's fine.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.319
He's just waking up.
Might be grouchy but it should be fine.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.800
- We'll try.
- Wanna try?

17:29.920 --> 17:32.240
- Hey.
- You wanna go?

17:32.480 --> 17:33.960
Oh, yes.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.400
Oh, my goodness.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.720
Okay, ready? Look like it's your son.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.800
So cute. Oh, my gosh, one more.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.920
Okay, great. Thank you so much.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.080
No problem.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.240
- Texting...
- Embarrassing.

17:47.360 --> 17:51.480
Why? I'm texting you this picture and
I want you to send it to Mo right away.

17:51.640 --> 17:54.040
- What?
- Will you send them to Mo right away?

17:54.200 --> 17:57.080
- You're right. There are a lot of babies.
- I know, right?

17:58.200 --> 18:00.720
It's like every white mother
has a black baby.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.800
- You'll be part of it.
- I'll be trendy.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.520
- We'll be in fashion.
- Yeah.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.400
It's great inspiration for Nasty Baby.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.920
I'm gonna do what you are doing

18:14.640 --> 18:16.240
Why do they do that?

18:17.840 --> 18:21.400
- Is that what you're doing?
- No, I'm doing better. It's really hard.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.000
- I'm sure it's hard.
- Do one. Do her. Do that.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.160
- You're good. Yes, you're good.
- Good? Thanks.

18:29.280 --> 18:32.200
- You wanna be part of the video?
- I thought it's just you.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.960
- I'm gonna change it a little.
- Have more people?

18:35.120 --> 18:36.360
- I think so.
- I'll do it.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.520
- I can change it.
- I'll totally do it. For a few seconds.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.760
- I got your text.
- I'm not gonna be naked.

18:48.440 --> 18:49.800
Hey!

18:50.760 --> 18:51.880
Mo!

18:52.040 --> 18:53.960
- You got a text message.
- What?

18:54.080 --> 18:56.920
- What?
- You got a text message!

18:57.120 --> 18:59.200
I think it's important.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.240
That's kind of cute, man.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.400
Fucking morons.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.040
What the fuck?

19:11.200 --> 19:13.240
Yeah, that's hilarious. He's with Polly.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.560
- Come on.
- I don't know.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.520
That's... That's what he wrote back?

19:28.360 --> 19:30.560
I don't know, eight episodes, I guess.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.360
Dude, I saw Nick Cavett,
like, everything on YouTube.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.480
Dick Cavett.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.840
Dick Cavett.
I always call him Nick Cavett.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.840
Got a sale. Got a sale. Got a sale.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.840
- Hey, what you got here?
- Got a sale.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.840
- How much is this pot here?
- Five dollars.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.480
- Five?
- One dollar.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.960
- One dollar. Okay.
- What's your name?

19:48.120 --> 19:50.200
- Polly.
- They call me the Bishop.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.920
- The Bishop?
- Bishop, what's up?

19:53.680 --> 19:56.560
- Everything is a dollar.
- Okay, she's gonna get the lamp.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.600
- All right, that's a dollar.
- You want this lamp, right?

20:00.640 --> 20:02.280
- That's great. Thank you.
- Pretty.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.800
- I'm gonna get the pot.
- Not as pretty as you.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.840
- That's... Thank you.
- You're gonna get the pot. A dollar.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.440
- Okay. That's...
- Two dollars.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.800
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Thank you.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.480
- Thank you, Polly.
- Thank you, Bishop.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.680
- Did I tell you my name was Bishop?
- Yes.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.800
- See you around.
- Thank you very much.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.360
- Goodbye.
- Have a good day.

20:19.640 --> 20:22.680
- Dude, there's, like, bed bugs. I see them.
- Goodbye, Polly!

20:22.840 --> 20:24.800
Bye. Bye. Thank you.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.040
I think I have a new boyfriend.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.480
- Do you like him?
- I should ask him for sperm.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.400
- I'm kidding.
- Better than mine, sure.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.800
Hello, Freddy.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.560
Hey. How are you, Richard?

20:36.720 --> 20:39.640
I'm okay. You're encouraging
bad behavior, both of you.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.920
- I'm encouraging what?
- Bad behavior.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.880
- What do you mean?
- Buying things from that man.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.560
It encourages him.

20:46.720 --> 20:49.000
- Why? Big deal.
- Yes. Okay.

20:49.120 --> 20:52.640
- Do you like leaf blowers in the morning?
- Is he the leaf blower guy?

20:52.800 --> 20:55.120
- He's the leaf blower guy.
- He's not.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.520
He's my enemy. For real, like...

20:57.680 --> 20:59.880
- I know.
- Take it back, get your money back.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.080
- I'm gonna go get... I'm kidding.
- No, no.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.920
- That's Wendy.
- This stove is disgusting.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.560
- Wendy, Polly. Polly, Wendy.
- Hi.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.920
- She's my new assistant.
- Oh, cool. Hello.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.760
- Hi. Sorry.
- Yeah, no, it's okay. No? Okay.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.200
Yup.

21:22.880 --> 21:23.840
- How are you?
- Good.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
- You biked?
- Yeah, I'm a little sweaty.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.000
Hey, listen.
So Polly's gonna be part of Nasty Baby.

21:29.560 --> 21:30.840
- What?
- Is that happening?

21:31.000 --> 21:33.320
- It's happening.
- You really want me to do it?

21:33.440 --> 21:36.560
- She's gonna do a baby.
- No, he wants me to, like, be in it.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.800
- Are you doing it?
- I...

21:38.960 --> 21:40.480
- Do you want me to...?
- Sorry.

21:40.640 --> 21:42.480
- I'd love to... You know.
- We'll see.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.760
Oh, it's Mo. It's Mo. It's Mo.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.760
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.720
- Hey.
- Yeah.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.960
I mean, I'm feeling a little more open.
I don't wanna be...

21:52.120 --> 21:56.720
like a self-absorbed freak
like Marina Abramovic or any...

21:56.880 --> 21:58.800
Like, I don't want it to be about me.

21:58.960 --> 22:02.080
Okay, I'm going to meet him now.
We're meeting each other now.

22:02.240 --> 22:05.880
- Okay, be tactful and nice, okay?
- What do you think I'm gonna do?

22:06.040 --> 22:07.040
- I'm...
- Be tactful?

22:07.200 --> 22:09.400
- You're like the semen vampire.
- Oh, my God.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.240
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Stop. She...

22:11.400 --> 22:13.200
- That sounds weird.
- It sounds cool.

22:13.360 --> 22:17.720
So I'm thinking doing
the first, like, recordings...

22:17.880 --> 22:21.160
- ...in that space there.
- Really? It seems a little too small.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.320
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:22.480 --> 22:26.080
So I think I'll do it here.
We'll put a blanket or something. Yeah?

22:45.960 --> 22:49.640
Kind of self-explanatory.
Just do what you gotta do in here.

22:49.800 --> 22:53.120
Be careful not to touch the inside
of the cup with your fingers.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.920
And here we are.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.120
Great. There you go.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.120
This is so romantic.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.360
Yes, well, use your imagination. Or phone.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.800
- There's a skeleton.
- It's naked, sort of.

23:07.840 --> 23:08.800
Thanks.

23:27.880 --> 23:30.280
Polly, I need you. It's Angie.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.440
Fuck.

23:38.720 --> 23:41.440
Told her to keep the hood off.
Let it get some air.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.800
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

23:42.960 --> 23:46.080
Come on in here. Thank you.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.200
Come, sit and wait for me.
Don't go anywhere.

23:49.360 --> 23:50.920
We're talking.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.600
Polly.

24:01.760 --> 24:06.280
I just had a patient come in.
Can you just give it to Lois or something?

24:08.800 --> 24:10.080
What happened?

24:10.240 --> 24:12.800
- This is a nice necklace.
- Thank you. What happened?

24:12.960 --> 24:14.720
You know what happened.

24:18.520 --> 24:19.960
I'm sorry. Thank you.

24:20.640 --> 24:21.600
Bye.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.760
No way.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.400
Freddy.

24:47.240 --> 24:50.600
- Bishop!
- Freddy.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.160
Let's go to the park.

24:55.960 --> 24:58.120
Let's go. Let's go to the park.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.040
- What?
- Let's go to the park and go for a run.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.600
Can you get me my gloves, please?

25:03.760 --> 25:05.120
Come on.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.520
Be a good wife.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.440
I'm gonna talk to this guy, man.

25:22.080 --> 25:24.160
Bishop, what are you doing, man?

25:24.320 --> 25:26.560
Hey, Bishop. Dude, what are you doing?

25:26.720 --> 25:29.240
- Yo, what the fuck, man?
- Back up! Fucking faggot!

25:29.400 --> 25:32.160
- You too.
- What the fuck is your problem, dude?

25:32.320 --> 25:34.600
- Fucking asshole, man.
- Come on.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.640
Makes me wanna fucking...

25:38.800 --> 25:42.240
What you have to fucking do
is calm down. You're gonna be a dad.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.320
That's the example you wanna set?
That you're freaking out?

25:45.480 --> 25:47.360
What? You are gonna be a dad...

25:47.520 --> 25:50.760
so don't jerk off
and eat a lot of pistachios today, man.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.800
You ready for that? You're freaking out.

25:54.240 --> 25:55.960
I'm ready for it. I'm not... No.

25:56.120 --> 25:59.040
I'm as ready as I'm gonna be for it.

25:59.680 --> 26:03.920
But seriously, you have to deal with that.
You know, you complain about your dad.

26:04.080 --> 26:07.400
I mean, you need to deal
with your own anger management issues.

26:07.520 --> 26:10.520
- Yeah, I'm trying.
- Well, you try harder.

26:39.440 --> 26:43.280
- Can you give me a hand with this stuff?
- Yeah, sure. Right on.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.240
- Chino.
- Can I get a hit?

26:47.840 --> 26:50.200
Chino, come on, give me a hand with these.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.360
I'll be right out.

26:57.280 --> 26:58.840
Hey, I think Nico's here.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.360
Straight in. Straight in.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.880
Yo, I'm fine, man. Thanks.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.080
- I'm good.
- I got you.

27:04.240 --> 27:05.240
- Thanks.
- I got you.

27:05.400 --> 27:06.560
Thanks.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.400
Freddy, get that box and those.

27:16.320 --> 27:17.280
- Okay.
- A real baby?

27:17.440 --> 27:19.040
- Bye.
- Bye. I'll see you later.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.120
- Have a good day.
- Let's talk about it.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.800
- We'll talk about it.
- Do you want me to act?

27:23.960 --> 27:26.560
- I want you to perform. I'll tell you later.
- Okay.

27:26.720 --> 27:29.160
Mo knows everything about it.
See you later, man.

27:29.320 --> 27:31.360
Nico, you don't wanna do Nasty Baby.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.880
Hey! Hey! Now, where you going?
Hey, where you going?

27:35.040 --> 27:36.560
Buzz him. Buzz him. Buzz him.

27:51.560 --> 27:55.800
I don't know. What you talking about?
What you talking about?

27:56.640 --> 27:58.240
What you talking about?

27:59.280 --> 28:00.720
What you talking about?

28:16.320 --> 28:19.120
Mom, gas stove.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.840
Yo, Nasty. Yo.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.000
Wait, no.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.200
What are you doing?

28:26.520 --> 28:28.640
That's a lot. Yeah.

28:28.800 --> 28:29.920
No.

28:32.400 --> 28:35.880
I don't how to exactly...
I just know the chorus.

28:36.040 --> 28:39.240
True love will find you in the end

28:42.080 --> 28:43.440
- You sing it with me.
- Okay.

28:43.600 --> 28:48.760
- True love will find you in the end
- True love will find you in the end

28:51.840 --> 28:54.600
- You'll find out just who...
- You'll find out just who...

28:54.720 --> 28:57.520
I don't know. Are we out of tune?
Can you play louder?

28:57.680 --> 28:58.960
Oh, yeah.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.680
Don't be sad, I know...

29:00.840 --> 29:03.960
- Little help. Little help?
- What?

29:09.280 --> 29:11.200
Friend

29:12.480 --> 29:14.280
What's going on?

29:14.560 --> 29:16.320
I can't do it.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.480
- What do you mean?
- Dude, I can't do this.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.640
Why?

29:22.800 --> 29:25.880
- Nothing's working. I can't get hard.
- It's gonna be weird.

29:26.040 --> 29:28.480
No. It doesn't feel right.
It doesn't feel right.

29:28.640 --> 29:31.200
- I thought I wanted to.
- Don't fuck with her mind.

29:31.360 --> 29:35.440
It feels wrong. I'm not fucking
with her mind. It just feels wrong.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.760
Okay.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.360
- Maybe I'm gonna do it. I'll ask her.
- What?

29:41.960 --> 29:44.960
I mean, since she's already here.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.320
We'll just tell her
and we'll figure it out from there.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.240
What?

29:59.360 --> 30:01.160
I can't do it.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.720
Okay, like, what do you mean?

30:09.440 --> 30:11.880
- It doesn't feel right.
- Like, right now, or...?

30:12.040 --> 30:13.720
It's kind of weird that I'm here.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.840
- No, it's not.
- I'm one wall away.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.880
He's just nervous. I think it's...

30:18.040 --> 30:20.640
- Well, maybe you go in, and...
- It's the pressure.

30:20.800 --> 30:23.360
That's what I thought
the help was for, but...

30:26.920 --> 30:28.800
I know it's annoying.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.720
- No, it's fine.
- It's fine?

30:30.880 --> 30:34.400
I was thinking that maybe...
What if I do it? Do you want me to do it?

30:34.560 --> 30:37.280
- How many times have we tried?
- Okay. Yeah, I know.

30:37.440 --> 30:42.040
- But this is like the best day and...
- Yeah, I guess if I'm not getting...

30:42.600 --> 30:46.280
Only if you want. It's not like
I'm gonna force you to have my semen.

30:46.400 --> 30:50.600
No, I'm not... You're not forcing me.
I'm just very sorry, that's all.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.080
You're being very nice.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.720
- Why not, right?
- We're here.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.000
Okay.

30:55.160 --> 30:57.120
- You think I'm weird.
- No, no.

30:57.280 --> 30:58.880
- Thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.960
Have fun in there.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.920
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.640
I'm sorry too.
I didn't mean to get weird about it.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.960
- It's a... Have that effect...
- Oh, wait. My mom's calling.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.840
- Hi, Mama.
- Hello, my love.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.560
- How you doing?
- I'm fine. How are you?

31:19.200 --> 31:21.480
- Hi, Polly.
- Hi.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.840
Oh, you're so sweet.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.680
It's nice to meet you too.

31:27.360 --> 31:30.120
And your father is very excited, Mo.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.200
- Yeah?
- He's excited to meet Freddy.

31:32.360 --> 31:34.760
And I've planned a nice dinner, yes?

31:34.880 --> 31:37.800
That's great. That's big.
That's a big step.

31:37.960 --> 31:39.240
- Yes.
- It's about time.

31:39.400 --> 31:42.520
So you guys are...? You have the route?
You have your...

31:42.680 --> 31:44.400
- Hey.
- We should be there around 6.

31:44.560 --> 31:46.360
Cecilia, how are you?

31:46.520 --> 31:48.760
Hi, Freddy. How you doing, baby?

31:48.920 --> 31:50.480
I'm good. You're looking good.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.760
Not bad for an old girl, huh?

31:54.280 --> 31:55.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:55.560 --> 31:59.280
- That's right. Come on, let me hear it.
- See you... See you soon.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.080
Bye.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.080
All right, well, I'm expecting you guys
bright and early.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.600
Yeah, actually,
we'll probably be there later.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.440
Probably around 5 or 6.

32:09.600 --> 32:14.320
Okay. All right. But just arrive alive,
that's the most important thing.

32:14.480 --> 32:15.880
- Okay, Mom.
- All right, baby.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.600
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.440
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.560
Come forward. Come forward.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.760
Come on, come forward.

32:52.560 --> 32:53.880
Hello, Mama.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.680
How did it go?

32:58.320 --> 32:59.320
I dumped it.

32:59.480 --> 33:02.000
You guys can have the rest for dessert.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.720
You dumped it out? What? You didn't do it?

33:04.880 --> 33:05.880
No, I didn't.

33:06.640 --> 33:08.640
What's the point? It's not gonna work.

33:08.800 --> 33:12.040
We've used yours five times.
I don't think you guys understand.

33:13.640 --> 33:17.120
It's not the putting it in,
it's the disappointment every month.

33:17.280 --> 33:21.280
Like, getting the rejection, saying that
it's negative every fucking month.

33:21.440 --> 33:23.160
It's, like, I just...

33:23.520 --> 33:26.160
I came here tonight,
I thought this was gonna work.

33:26.320 --> 33:29.240
And your sperm tested so well
and I was so excited.

33:29.400 --> 33:32.120
I was like, "Okay, finally,
we're fucking doing it."

33:32.280 --> 33:34.880
It's not a decision to be made lightly.

33:35.040 --> 33:38.280
- I know. Well, then...
- It's my life too. It affects my life too.

33:40.440 --> 33:43.520
- Yours isn't working. I'm sorry, it's not.
- No, that I know.

33:43.840 --> 33:46.600
It's not like, "Let's keep trying.
Let's keep trying."

33:46.720 --> 33:50.320
This is... I don't have,
like, a lot of time.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.240
- I understand, Polly.
- You don't understand.

33:53.400 --> 33:55.720
- I do. Sorry.
- You don't, Freddy. You don't.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.280
Hey.

33:57.720 --> 33:59.600
Right, I'm sorry. I'm just gonna go.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.640
Good night.

34:35.920 --> 34:39.920
Polly. Polly. Polly.
You like that lamp, right?

34:41.920 --> 34:44.520
Yeah. Excuse me.

34:44.679 --> 34:48.000
No. You threw it out, Polly.

34:48.280 --> 34:51.080
Oh, no, I didn't throw it out.
I just couldn't carry it.

34:51.239 --> 34:53.080
I picked it up off the street.

34:53.560 --> 34:54.719
Don't lie.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.800
No need to lie.

34:57.280 --> 34:58.280
Sorry.

34:58.440 --> 35:00.680
- Why you gonna lie?
- Calm down, please.

35:00.800 --> 35:04.560
You're a pretty girl, Polly. Why you
be hanging outwith them faggots?

35:04.720 --> 35:07.080
- Master Bishop.
- Oh, here comes one now.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.840
Why do you keep invading
this young lady's space?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.680
- Shut up, you old faggot.
- Stop.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.600
- You're always crossing boundaries.
- Old-school faggot.

35:14.760 --> 35:17.680
People have boundaries. Run along.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.360
- Bye-bye.
- Good night, Polly.

35:19.520 --> 35:21.120
- Bye.
- Good night.

35:22.680 --> 35:26.000
I'm sorry about that.
He's harmless, but he's a pain in the ass.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.360
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35:30.560 --> 35:34.400
How's the baby thing coming along?

35:34.720 --> 35:35.840
Good. Yeah, it's good.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.400
It's wonderful
that they're gonna have a baby.

35:38.560 --> 35:39.920
And you'll make it happen.

35:40.080 --> 35:43.400
In my day, we were, like,
fairies or pansies. We couldn't even...

35:43.520 --> 35:47.240
- Nobody'd like a pansy to have a baby.
- I have to go. Sorry. I have to go.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.440
- I understand.
- Thank you though.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.880
Scoot safely.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.160
What the fuck?

36:13.320 --> 36:14.840
Babe.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.280
Babe.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.680
What are you doing?

36:31.200 --> 36:33.120
Don't watch that.

36:34.800 --> 36:38.200
I'm sorry. This is disgusting.

36:38.640 --> 36:41.480
- This is not good for you.
- It's not good for me at all.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.560
- It's not healthy.
- I know, I know.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.920
Dude, I promise, like, I'm over it.

36:46.080 --> 36:49.840
I'd much rather a little Mo
than a little Freddy.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.080
Dude, look at that. Come on.

36:52.360 --> 36:53.360
Fuck that.

36:53.520 --> 36:56.840
Whatever it is, it won't be that.

36:58.160 --> 36:59.400
Dude, this motherfucker.

36:59.560 --> 37:03.000
I'm gonna call 311.
Like, it's enough. Honestly.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.640
- You can try.
- Okay.

37:09.440 --> 37:13.760
Hello, and thank you for calling 311
in New York City.

37:13.920 --> 37:14.880
We're here to help.

37:15.040 --> 37:19.720
If this is an emergency,
please hang up and dial 911.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.160
- Today...
- Hey, just come to bed.

37:23.320 --> 37:24.360
Yeah.

37:24.520 --> 37:26.760
...and parking meter rules are in effect.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.560
Tomorrow. Tuesday.

37:28.720 --> 37:31.560
Alternate side parking
and parking meter rules in effect.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.320
It's Sula.

37:44.440 --> 37:47.520
- I can't. I'm not in the mood.
- You had it there for a second.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.720
- You just...
- The setup is fucking weird.

37:49.880 --> 37:51.160
And Sula, like, look.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.920
Just, Sula, leave.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.320
Call it a day.
Find out those prices in Bushwick.

37:59.480 --> 38:02.360
- I don't want anything too expensive.
- I'll call the guy.

38:02.520 --> 38:05.200
These are so cute.
It doesn't look like you anymore.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.360
What is that supposed to mean?

38:07.520 --> 38:10.880
Oh, I didn't mean it like that.
You're cute in a different way now.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.320
Hey.

38:12.480 --> 38:14.840
- Hello, guys.
- Hey.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.080
Happy birthday.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.840
- Oh, yeah.
- Whose birthday party?

38:20.000 --> 38:22.280
It's my birthday party.

38:22.440 --> 38:23.960
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

38:24.120 --> 38:25.800
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Sweetest thing.

38:25.960 --> 38:28.160
- You see that?
- I did see it.

38:28.320 --> 38:29.720
Read the inscription.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.320
"Do you feel the cake coming at you?"

38:32.480 --> 38:35.120
Dude, please come.
Feel it coming at you. It's weird.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.640
It was an accident.
It's not that I planned it.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.640
- You see it?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

39:07.680 --> 39:09.120
Hey, Polly. Hey, Polly.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.680
Polly, Polly.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.440
Hey, let me help you.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.680
- No, I don't need any help.
- I can help.

39:15.840 --> 39:17.640
- I don't need any help.
- We friends.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.040
- We're not friends.
- Let me get it. I got it.

39:20.160 --> 39:23.640
- What are you doing? Get off me!
- Come on, Polly. I'm trying to help.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.360
- What are you doing? Get away!
- I'm helping you.

39:26.520 --> 39:28.960
- What is wrong with you?
- I was helping.

39:32.440 --> 39:34.760
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.960
- Do you need anything?
- No, I'm okay. Thanks.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.320
Fuck.

39:53.360 --> 39:55.320
Okay, Chino, we're gonna go find him.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.800
- No, what? Why?
- He's probably somewhere...

39:57.920 --> 40:01.360
two blocks away, parking cars,
harassing other women, fuck that.

40:01.520 --> 40:03.160
- Can I stay?
- No, Chino, come on.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.160
Fucking get up. Come with me.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.240
- I think that's not smart.
- Yeah.

40:07.360 --> 40:10.680
- It's not... I'm not gonna get into a fistfight.
- All right. Okay.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.120
Yeah, I'm gonna come too. We'll go...

40:13.280 --> 40:14.960
We'll go get him.

40:19.520 --> 40:22.360
- There's more people there.
- They probably live there.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.920
He's always by himself.

40:25.600 --> 40:28.160
Hey. Hello?

40:33.640 --> 40:36.160
- Hi. Good night.
- What you want?

40:36.320 --> 40:37.760
- Is the Bishop here?
- What?

40:37.920 --> 40:41.160
- Is the Bishop here? The Bishop.
- No. Who are you?

40:41.280 --> 40:44.360
- Oh, I'm a neighbor.
- I've never seen you around here.

40:44.520 --> 40:46.880
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Lady, calm down.

40:47.040 --> 40:49.920
- Do you live here? Is he here?
- I'm here. Yeah. No.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.720
He did something wrong.
I could call the police...

40:52.880 --> 40:54.960
- ...but I came to talk to him.
- No police.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.680
No police. Yes.
So can you please call him?

40:57.840 --> 40:59.640
- Is he here?
- Yeah. I'll call him.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.240
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Is he here or not?

41:02.400 --> 41:04.920
- No, he's not here. Go.
- Freddy, let's go.

41:05.080 --> 41:07.640
There are more people.
They're staring at us.

41:22.680 --> 41:23.680
What is it?

41:23.840 --> 41:25.440
- Oh, good job.
- What is that?

41:25.600 --> 41:27.120
- A blender.
- What the hell?

41:27.280 --> 41:29.240
- Oh, man.
- Oh, my God.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.360
- Happy birthday, Mo.
- Oh, my God.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.920
No, this is a fucking Festool.
It's the best...

41:34.760 --> 41:36.960
- Stink bombs.
- Yeah!

41:37.120 --> 41:40.920
- Where the fuck did you get this from?
- He's like, "I have 25 cents.

41:41.080 --> 41:44.000
- "I'm gonna get a stink bomb."
- What do I get?"

41:45.520 --> 41:48.760
Guys, make sure you use the napkins.
Use the napkins.

41:48.920 --> 41:51.840
- No, because then it'll get everywhere.
- On the hand.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.080
Yeah, coming out of his belly.
It's like a horse.

41:55.240 --> 41:57.800
- You don't want...
- No, no, no. Don't light that.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.280
Don't smoke. It's bad for your sperm.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.680
Polly, give him a break. Is it really bad?

42:02.840 --> 42:06.440
- Yeah, it is, but maybe tomorrow.
- It's my sperm's birthday too.

42:06.960 --> 42:10.320
- Well, how would you ever know?
- No, because it looks like that.

42:10.480 --> 42:11.680
A knight.

42:13.520 --> 42:15.200
- Look at that.
- Yeah, okay.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.680
Okay, let's chill.

42:16.800 --> 42:20.640
Oh, dude. Why don't we go throw
the stink bombs to the Bishop?

42:20.800 --> 42:22.400
Hey, stop that.

42:22.560 --> 42:25.920
Why don't we go throw the stink bombs
to the Bishop's place?

42:26.080 --> 42:28.040
- Come on.
- I... We can't go.

42:28.200 --> 42:30.880
- Mo, you into it? I'll totally do it.
- It's fine.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.960
This is revenge, doing this for you.

42:33.120 --> 42:36.240
- For real?
- Shut up. Fuck.

42:39.240 --> 42:41.160
- Come on.
- Let's enjoy the revenge.

42:41.320 --> 42:45.600
- There's nothing to enjoy.
- Come on, don't lie. You like this idea.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.560
This is gonna be crazy.

42:47.720 --> 42:49.720
- Is he putting it inside?
- Gonna get...

42:49.880 --> 42:51.560
One, two, three.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.080
Fuck that.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.320
Oh, my God.

42:56.480 --> 42:59.560
What the...? Oh, hell, no.

43:01.440 --> 43:02.560
What the...?

43:02.720 --> 43:04.760
Oh, my gosh. That's a kid. There's a kid.

43:04.920 --> 43:08.680
- No, Mommy!
- Oh, my gosh. Freddy.

43:08.800 --> 43:13.000
- All of you, just shut up!
- Get that kid out of here!

43:14.240 --> 43:16.480
There's a fucking kid. That is not cool.

43:16.640 --> 43:19.160
What the hell did you do?

43:20.560 --> 43:23.360
- Oh, my God!
- This...

43:23.520 --> 43:25.440
This is fucked up.

43:25.720 --> 43:28.240
- Yeah, it's not that funny.
- No, it's not funny.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.600
- I'm leaving. I don't like this.
- Wait.

43:30.760 --> 43:33.000
- Are you really leaving?
- I don't wanna hear.

43:33.160 --> 43:34.680
Good night.

43:47.480 --> 43:49.800
- Hey, guys, what's up?
- Hey, man.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.880
- How was it?
- Not so good.

43:56.640 --> 43:58.440
Throwing that stink bomb, that...

43:58.600 --> 44:01.520
Hey, guys, you can stay.
Like, for real, stay.

44:01.680 --> 44:03.680
We're gonna go to bed, but stay.

44:03.840 --> 44:05.160
- No, no, no.
- No, for real.

44:05.320 --> 44:07.040
- I mean it.
- Okay.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.920
Can you sing it for us?

44:10.240 --> 44:11.600
Sure.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.440
- You don't have to.
- Yeah.

44:13.600 --> 44:15.400
- I don't think...
- Try it.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.080
No, I don't wanna fuck it up.

44:17.560 --> 44:18.920
I got it.

44:19.040 --> 44:21.280
- You fucked it up.
- I fucked it up.

44:21.720 --> 44:22.720
No.

44:22.880 --> 44:26.320
- Do you know how to start it?
- No, I haven't done it. I'll try again.

44:26.480 --> 44:30.600
Oh, yes. Yeah. I can do that.
I can get that. I can get that.

44:50.960 --> 44:53.120
Babe, what are you doing?

44:56.240 --> 44:58.160
Hey, come back!

45:04.960 --> 45:08.120
- What the fuck is your problem?
- Hey! Get out of the way!

45:08.280 --> 45:09.440
Hey, hey, hey!

45:09.600 --> 45:12.680
Here, here, here!

45:13.320 --> 45:14.560
Hey!

45:14.720 --> 45:17.280
- What the fuck is your problem?
- What's going on?

45:17.440 --> 45:20.840
- He stopped me from cleaning!
- No, he harassed my friend sexually.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.040
Wait. What, sexually harassed?
I saw him with a leaf blower.

45:24.200 --> 45:26.360
What is he sexually harassing?

45:26.520 --> 45:29.160
- He harassed my friend.
- I didn't harass nobody!

45:29.320 --> 45:31.360
Bishop, take a minute. You know me.

45:31.520 --> 45:34.200
Take a minute. Chill out. Chill out.
What's going on?

45:34.360 --> 45:36.320
This man sexually harassed our friend.

45:36.480 --> 45:38.840
- She was walking and he grabbed her.
- Negro!

45:39.000 --> 45:40.320
Okay, Bishop. Bishop.

45:40.480 --> 45:42.760
- Okay, take a minute. Hold on.
- What the fuck?

45:42.920 --> 45:45.200
What else?
Why did you take the leaf blower?

45:45.360 --> 45:47.560
The leaf blowing is, like, every morning.

45:47.680 --> 45:51.120
- I call 311. It's not legal before 8 a.m.
- Nobody cares about that.

45:51.280 --> 45:53.600
- He's assaulting people on the street.
- Okay.

45:53.760 --> 45:57.920
Those fucking bitches threw
a fucking bomb in my apartment!

45:58.080 --> 46:01.160
- Oh, yes, you fucking did!
- Terrorists! Osama bin Laden!

46:01.320 --> 46:05.920
- Yes, I did hear you, ma'am. Calm down.
- It was a stink bomb. It's a joke thing.

46:06.080 --> 46:08.520
Okay, I don't wanna hear anymore
about bombs.

46:08.680 --> 46:11.200
I don't want you
to be blowing this leaf blower.

46:11.360 --> 46:14.800
Now, take a walk. Go down the street.
Take your girlfriend with you.

46:14.960 --> 46:17.800
- There's a fucking kid in there.
- I know. Go on with him.

46:17.960 --> 46:19.880
- That's okay to get in your face?
- No.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.120
- He's not dealing with a full deck.
- You arrest him.

46:23.280 --> 46:27.000
- He just threatened you with...
- He's crazy. Everybody knows he's crazy.

46:27.160 --> 46:28.840
So if you try to press charges...

46:29.000 --> 46:32.520
all they gonna do is put him
in a crazy house, let him out in days.

46:32.680 --> 46:36.200
But listen to me. That house
where he's staying at is gonna be sold.

46:36.360 --> 46:40.200
He's gonna be out of here. Nothing
you can do because his mom is a judge.

46:40.360 --> 46:41.560
- Oh, good.
- Judge Judy.

46:41.720 --> 46:44.560
- We don't need any sarcasm.
- So your mommy's a judge...

46:44.720 --> 46:47.560
- ...then you can be a criminal?
- I'm bringing up a point.

46:47.720 --> 46:50.720
- He's up on DeKalb attacking people.
- Happens every week.

46:50.880 --> 46:54.040
Something needs to be done.
He's crazy, put him in a crazy...

46:54.200 --> 46:56.080
He's gonna be okay. I'll talk to him.

46:56.240 --> 46:58.400
Thank you, officer. Thank you.

46:59.040 --> 47:00.320
I'd say every five hours.

47:00.920 --> 47:02.920
- Five hours?
- Yeah, pour a little bit.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.640
The cactus as well?
Like, every plant is the same?

47:05.800 --> 47:09.240
- Cactus, you don't need to do anything.
- Chino, the second one is C?

47:09.400 --> 47:11.680
- C?
- The second one, yeah.

47:11.840 --> 47:13.440
- Then you go to E minor.
- Okay.

47:13.880 --> 47:15.520
Come on!

47:18.360 --> 47:20.000
So, what is this again?

47:20.160 --> 47:22.800
You don't have to worry about that.

47:23.440 --> 47:24.600
Do me a favor.

47:24.760 --> 47:29.000
When you get about 50miles out,
call to tell me everything's all right.

47:29.160 --> 47:31.640
- Not having any problems.
- I will. Okay. See you.

47:31.800 --> 47:35.760
- Safe journey to all of you.
- Thanks for the ride, Richard.

47:38.920 --> 47:41.360
My ex-boyfriend wanted to go
to my country house.

47:41.520 --> 47:44.000
Wouldn't allow me,
neighbors weren't cool with it.

47:44.160 --> 47:46.600
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. I got into a huge fight.

47:46.760 --> 47:50.920
And then I'm like, "Listen,
when you think of me and my boyfriend...

47:51.040 --> 47:52.920
you just go like this:

47:53.080 --> 47:55.160
'Cock, asshole. Cock, asshole."'

47:55.320 --> 47:57.120
My mom said, "Oh, my God. He knows."

47:57.280 --> 47:59.600
- You said that to your mom?
- I went like this:

47:59.760 --> 48:01.600
Your mom did not say "he knows."

48:01.760 --> 48:05.000
No, she did not say "he knows," but...
They were amused.

48:05.120 --> 48:07.280
- "He knows."
- "He knows."

48:07.680 --> 48:10.480
Okay, I don't want you guys to think
this is weird...

48:10.640 --> 48:13.960
but I brought my kit with me
because I'm ovulating today.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.360
- You're ovulating again?
- Yes. Not again.

48:16.480 --> 48:19.080
You always say "again"
like I'm ovulating every day.

48:19.240 --> 48:21.040
You're like a chicken or something.

48:21.200 --> 48:24.000
- Can we listen to some music?
- Yeah, play that song.

48:24.160 --> 48:28.840
- This is the song that I'm learning.
- "True Love Will Find You In the End."

48:29.000 --> 48:30.960
In the end.

48:35.480 --> 48:37.440
Hi, Mommy.

48:37.600 --> 48:40.160
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

48:40.640 --> 48:43.320
- Hey, everybody. They're here.
- Gosh, they're here.

48:43.480 --> 48:45.560
- This is Polly.
- Jeremiah.

48:45.720 --> 48:47.560
- Hi. Polly.
- Nice to meet you.

48:47.680 --> 48:49.840
- Mo-Mo.
- Good to see you.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.320
Oh, Jeremiah. How are you?

48:51.480 --> 48:53.440
Good to see you. Good to see you again.

48:53.600 --> 48:56.360
- Oh, my God. Look at you.
- That's all right.

48:56.520 --> 48:58.920
- How are you?
- Haven't seen you in so long.

48:59.040 --> 49:01.600
- I know, I just...
- You look good.

49:01.760 --> 49:03.560
- Yeah.
- This is Freddy.

49:03.720 --> 49:07.960
It's a pleasure. Freddy.
Nice to meet you, finally.

49:09.120 --> 49:10.920
Oh, this looks great.

49:11.080 --> 49:13.000
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- That's good.

49:13.120 --> 49:15.680
All right. There.
Put the potatoes here, sweetie.

49:15.840 --> 49:18.840
Then we all ran
because we didn't want to be beaten.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.400
And then we hid in the woods.
We actually got lost in the woods.

49:22.560 --> 49:25.840
- Yeah, and I went crazy.
- Are you still close with your cousins?

49:26.000 --> 49:30.080
- Yeah, I talk to Howard.
- My cousin's one of my best friends ever.

49:30.240 --> 49:35.440
I... And if the timing of this works out,
it would be so nice to have...

49:36.000 --> 49:39.200
Because you're due very soon, you know.

49:39.360 --> 49:42.520
They could grow up, be the same age.
It would be so nice.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.120
- Yeah.
- I like that idea.

49:44.280 --> 49:47.520
You guys are in New York,
so it's gonna be a little bit hard...

49:47.680 --> 49:49.280
to, like, get them together.

49:50.040 --> 49:51.680
- Yeah.
- It wouldn't be that hard.

49:51.840 --> 49:53.800
I have cousins that don't live...

49:53.960 --> 49:56.920
- Yeah, we could come here.
- How often do you come, Mo?

49:57.080 --> 49:59.040
I'm here now. I come often...

49:59.200 --> 50:01.920
If I had a kid and you had a kid,
we would come.

50:02.080 --> 50:05.680
If I had a kid? I'm having this kid.
Mine is not a mystery.

50:07.480 --> 50:11.040
- The children can play. Sounds so nice.
- You don't look so excited...

50:11.200 --> 50:12.800
- I'm excited.
- ...about the idea.

50:12.960 --> 50:16.240
- What? Do I not look excited?
- No.

50:16.400 --> 50:21.640
I just... Okay. Well, you guys are trying it
out in a different way, you know.

50:21.800 --> 50:23.880
Maybe there's a reason it hasn't happened.

50:24.040 --> 50:25.640
- That's all I'm saying.
- Babe.

50:25.800 --> 50:28.520
What? "Babe" what? Don't "babe" me.

50:28.680 --> 50:31.960
What is...? What does that mean?
I mean, like...

50:33.360 --> 50:35.920
- I don't know what I mean.
- What do you mean by it?

50:36.080 --> 50:37.760
You do know what you mean.

50:37.920 --> 50:41.280
I mean, how...?
Like, how is this thing gonna work?

50:41.440 --> 50:43.280
How are you guys gonna...?

50:43.840 --> 50:47.080
Maybe this is really...
Maybe this is really normal in New York...

50:47.240 --> 50:50.920
- Why can't you just be supportive?
- I have been nothing but supportive.

50:51.040 --> 50:54.240
But this isn't...
This isn't one of your little schemes...

50:54.400 --> 50:58.760
like you moving off to the big city
and, you know, deciding you're gay and...

50:58.920 --> 51:02.040
I mean, this is a kid.
You're bringing a child into the world.

51:02.200 --> 51:06.480
They're bringing a child into a world
with three parents that love that child.

51:06.640 --> 51:10.080
I can assure you, a mom and a dad
does not create that all the time.

51:10.240 --> 51:13.520
I've seen situations
where kids have a mom and a dad...

51:13.680 --> 51:17.880
and the mom's an alcoholic or the dad,
like, beats up the mom. I mean...

51:18.040 --> 51:21.040
- Nobody is talking ab...
- I'm talking about that, though.

51:21.200 --> 51:25.280
My point is
that there's no normal situation at all.

51:25.440 --> 51:27.480
Reggie, don't go.

51:27.640 --> 51:31.520
What we're trying to say is that it's not...
You don't need a mom and a dad...

51:31.680 --> 51:34.720
but you need a loving mom or a loving dad.

51:34.880 --> 51:37.720
- It's more about how they are.
- That's...

51:50.400 --> 51:51.560
Lowest voice you can.

51:57.520 --> 51:59.480
- Yeah. A wish.
- Make a wish, baby.

51:59.640 --> 52:01.600
- A baby.
- A baby, a baby.

52:01.760 --> 52:03.840
- Twins.
- Yeah.

52:04.560 --> 52:07.640
And then as a consequence,
I was pissed off.

52:07.800 --> 52:10.960
- An annoyed little child.
- You're holding a pair of sunglasses.

52:11.120 --> 52:13.880
- You're so adorable, your face.
- I looked pretty cool.

52:14.040 --> 52:17.120
- There's Amy.
- Mo, look at you there with that dog.

52:17.280 --> 52:19.520
- Look at your white boots.
- I know. Yes.

52:19.680 --> 52:22.360
- Oh, my God. I can't take it.
- That's my favorite.

52:22.520 --> 52:25.600
Mo. I want one. I want one...

52:25.760 --> 52:28.640
that's half of that and half of me.

52:29.760 --> 52:33.000
Mo. We want it.

52:35.760 --> 52:37.960
Oh, no.

52:38.640 --> 52:41.200
- Come on, Mo, put it in.
- Come on, do it. Do it.

52:41.360 --> 52:45.200
- Mo, you're so cute and sweet.
- Mo.

52:45.600 --> 52:51.040
Mo, we would make such beautiful
little friendly creatures.

52:54.040 --> 52:55.840
All right, let's do it.

52:58.720 --> 52:59.840
Really?

53:00.600 --> 53:02.400
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Like right now?

53:02.560 --> 53:05.400
- Yeah, right now.
- Like I go get my kit right now?

53:05.560 --> 53:06.560
- Yeah, do it.
- Yeah.

53:06.720 --> 53:08.680
- Are you serious?
- Go get it. Come on.

53:08.840 --> 53:13.280
- My gosh. Before he changes his mind.
- Before I change every part of my mind.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.240
- Gross.
- My gosh.

53:19.640 --> 53:21.760
I'm gonna get you started.

53:25.960 --> 53:29.160
Dude, she's so excited.
Are you serious, you wanna do it?

53:29.320 --> 53:31.800
- Yeah.
- Don't fucking get cold feet now.

53:31.960 --> 53:33.080
Did you already start?

53:33.240 --> 53:35.440
- It's... It happened. You missed it.
- No.

53:35.600 --> 53:38.000
Just rub yourself
against that wet spot and...

53:38.160 --> 53:39.280
Okay, babe.

53:39.440 --> 53:41.280
It's all good.

53:41.520 --> 53:43.280
Okay.

53:43.440 --> 53:45.920
Listen, this is very serious.

53:46.840 --> 53:49.280
You know what this means.

53:49.440 --> 53:50.560
Yes.

53:50.720 --> 53:54.000
- And don't contaminate the specimen.
- We won't.

54:12.760 --> 54:14.600
Okay, hold it.

54:15.520 --> 54:17.600
Easy, easy, easy.

54:19.400 --> 54:20.840
You're good?

54:21.000 --> 54:22.440
Yeah.

54:43.680 --> 54:45.280
It's warm.

54:47.640 --> 54:49.920
Polly, just do it.

55:29.400 --> 55:31.240
You need help?

55:31.480 --> 55:32.480
Let me help you.

55:32.640 --> 55:35.680
- Do you wanna hold my legs up?
- Yeah. Hold on, one second.

55:37.560 --> 55:38.680
Yeah, lift me up.

55:38.840 --> 55:40.200
- Wait.
- And come that way.

55:40.800 --> 55:44.560
Okay, we have to think
positive thoughts...

55:44.720 --> 55:46.960
and tell the sperm to go right to the egg.

55:47.120 --> 55:48.840
Yeah. Babe, show her the picture.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.040
With you and the dog.

55:53.440 --> 55:55.000
That one.

55:55.560 --> 55:57.640
Oh, my God.

56:00.800 --> 56:02.480
Wait, wait. Hold it.

56:03.440 --> 56:04.680
Oh, shit.

56:04.840 --> 56:07.160
- Good night, kids.
- Good night, sexy.

56:07.680 --> 56:08.720
Good night.

56:13.440 --> 56:15.040
Good vibes, you guys.

56:15.360 --> 56:16.400
Good job, babe.

56:17.200 --> 56:18.200
Thank you.

56:23.200 --> 56:24.520
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you.

56:24.680 --> 56:26.720
- Come to New York, you promise?
- Promise.

56:26.880 --> 56:28.200
- Cross your fingers.
- Yeah.

56:28.360 --> 56:32.080
- Fingers are crossed, the prayers are up.
- Okay, thank you. Bye.

56:32.240 --> 56:33.920
Nice to meet you.

56:35.640 --> 56:37.560
Thank you so much. Come to New York.

56:37.720 --> 56:38.960
Goodbye, sweetie.

56:39.120 --> 56:40.760
- Take care of yourself.
- I will.

56:43.640 --> 56:45.400
Bye-bye.

56:50.680 --> 56:52.400
- Can I make a left here?
- Yeah.

56:53.040 --> 56:54.360
- Good night.
- Good night.

56:54.520 --> 56:55.520
- Bye.
- Bye.

56:55.680 --> 56:58.760
Okay, bye.

57:01.760 --> 57:02.880
You can go. I'm good.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.280
Me too. Go.

57:04.440 --> 57:05.920
Okay.

57:18.880 --> 57:20.600
Oh, what the fuck?

57:20.760 --> 57:23.040
- What the fuck is that?
- Is that human shit?

57:24.840 --> 57:27.440
- Someone took a shit on our stoop.
- Smells like it.

57:28.840 --> 57:29.880
Under fucking light.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.800
How bad is that?

58:21.560 --> 58:23.040
Oh, it's so humiliating.

58:23.480 --> 58:25.880
- Just come to bed.
- I wish I could.

58:26.040 --> 58:28.240
I feel unclean.

59:10.880 --> 59:12.400
Babe.

59:13.200 --> 59:16.440
What? Okay.

59:16.960 --> 59:19.600
- Good luck at the gallery.
- Thank you.

59:38.240 --> 59:39.760
Thank you.

59:43.920 --> 59:45.360
- Hi, excuse me.
- Hello.

59:45.520 --> 59:47.080
Hi. Are you guys set up?

59:47.240 --> 59:48.960
We have a meeting with Marcus.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.520
- Wendy, come check this out.
- Yeah.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.560
- Oh, I love it.
- It's crazy, right?

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.480
- Okay, let's go.
- No, you love this stuff.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.720
- You love Michael. You have to.
- Hurry up.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.520
Make sure it's in focus.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.800
- Hey. Hello.
- Hey, you guys.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.600
- How are you guys? Great.
- Ready.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.880
You wanna get the lights, Jesse?
Thank you.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.680
Do you wanna hit the space bar?

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.520
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.360
Let's hit it.

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.160
- This is gonna be working?
- Yeah.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.600
Okay.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.480
Yeah.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.120
No. That part is so good.
Wait. One second.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.920
Okay, okay.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.520
- It's her, yeah.
- Who is that?

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.000
It's my friend Polly.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:45.840
The friend that I told you
that I was trying to have a baby with.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
- Yeah. And then Wendy was there.
- Yeah.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.160
That's...

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.680
- You don't wanna finish it?
- No. We will. Can you hit the lights?

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:54.760
Look, but...

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.600
Yeah, hit the lights, Jesse. Thank you.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.880
- You don't like it?
- No, I do. I like it.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.560
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's different.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.800
Yeah, it's different than what we thought.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:06.280
- It's a lot different.
- I thought that it was...

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.560
it would be more compelling for people
at the gallery, maybe have a little stage.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.480
- Okay.
- Down... Like down below the...

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.240
Space is... It's a group show.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.440
- So people wi...
- But we'll put it to the Oracle.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.160
But is it gonna be part of it?

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.480
Well, I've gotta let the... I ca...

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.320
I don't make those decisions.
The Oracle makes those.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.680
What do you mean? Who is the Oracle?

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:27.920
Are you teasing me?

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.520
No. I really don't know
who you're talking about.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.080
Come here.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.680
Go first.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.000
You didn't like it, did you?

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.760
You... What's going on?

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.000
I'm a bit surprised, it's different.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.680
But this is where the decisions are made.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.440
What do you mean?

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.320
- That's the Oracle?
- This is.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.560
I mean, we light the candles.
We sit with a question.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.720
Okay? In our hearts.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.000
Marcus, you really are not being serious.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.440
- Are you kidding?
- What do you mean? How...?

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:11.320
How are you gonna consult to that
whether I can be in the show or not?

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.200
- Don't be tense.
- Okay.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.560
- Questions...
- This is weird. I don't get it.

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:16.960
Don't be tense.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.600
The questions are asked
and the answers come.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.640
But then how does the Oracle
answer to your question?

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.120
Freddy, the answers come.

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.680
Okay?

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.400
It's not okay. I don't get it.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.400
Did you study Greek or Latin ever?

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.600
Have you ever gone to high school?

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.320
I went to high school.
You don't need to get sassy.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.240
- Sassy?
- Yeah.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.720
Little cuteness party is sassy.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.200
That video is sassy.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.720
There's nothing personal about it.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.720
You talked to me
about honesty and embarrassment...

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.680
a short while ago in your place.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.600
You opened up something to me
and you... You were blushing.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.640
- You blushing seeing that?
- I'm blushing with this Oracle.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.880
- Honestly...
- Oh, you shouldn't say that.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.720
Maybe we should... We could go.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.960
I'm sorry, it's so weird, I don't get it.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.960
You don't have to. That's the point.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.680
- It has nothing to do with the intellect...
- Yeah.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:12.640
...and being cute and having all your
friends have a fucking slumber party.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:16.440
Excuse me. Okay? This is not Picasso Baby.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.480
- This is not a...
- Don't compare me with Picasso Baby.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.960
What do you have
all those people for, Freddy?

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.840
- We'll leave, you consult...
- No.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.760
- No. I'm not... I'm through.
- Okay.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.080
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.480
Thanks.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.920
Fucking asshole, dude.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.240
I don't know. Let's just go.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.400
Hey, Chino.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.880
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Hi. Is Mo here?

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.880
Yeah, he's in the office.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.840
Mo. Hi.

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.600
I'll be right back.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.640
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.480
- What's up?
- I'm coming by...

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.720
because I just...

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.880
I found out that I am...

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.960
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.760
Does Freddy know?

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.600
No, I haven't told him.
I wanted to come here...

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.160
and tell you first in person.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.480
And just make sure that it's okay...

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.760
and we're okay
and I have your permission...

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:53.920
- My permission?
- ...to move forward.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:57.600
I wanted to tell you in person.
So you're sure, okay? We're good?

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.800
- Yeah. Yes.
- Okay.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.440
What's going on?

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:06.520
- I'm pregnant. We're pregnant.
- What?

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.120
- That's amazing.
- Yeah. High-five.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.800
- Sorry.
- I'm pregnant, careful.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.160
Let's go to the roof.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.520
- Think that was legit?
- I don't know. I don't know. I just...

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.000
- Yeah, I don't know, Freddy.
- What do you mean?

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.760
I just like... I don't know, I don't think
you handled that the best way.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.840
What? That was the proper attitude.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.520
The guy didn't even watch
30 seconds of the video.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.840
- We worked so hard on that.
- Exactly. We should've waited.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.400
- Excuse me, are you Jewish?
- No. No, I'm not.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.440
- No.
- Are you sure you're not Jewish?

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.760
- Are you a lesbian?
- Freddy, dude.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.880
- No, dude.
- Why?

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.960
- Yeah, exactly.
- Okay, sorry.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.960
- What the hell was that?
- Hey, Wendy.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.480
- Nico, hey. What's up?
- Hey, what's up, man?

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:47.600
Hey, you guys wanna come to a barbecue?

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.760
- Yeah. You want...?
- I'm not into it.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.360
- Okay. I'm gonna go.
- Come on.

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.320
- Polly, wait. You're leaving?
- Yeah.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.880
- Okay.
- All right, see you.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.440
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi.

01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.320
How are you?

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:01.720
What happened?

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.760
It was just humiliating.
I'll tell you later. What's going on?

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.760
Well, I have bad news too.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.600
It didn't work.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.360
No. But listen, I'm...
I'm ovulating right now.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.920
So I'm thinking we try it again tonight.

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.680
I'm so upset.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:30.000
Yeah, why don't you talk to Mo about it?

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.680
Yeah, I think it's possible. You just...

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:38.600
- Yeah, just talk to him.
- All right. Well, I'll see you tonight.

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:41.280
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.360
- What did he say?
- That I sound upset.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.600
He had a bad day at the gallery today.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:50.320
Which will make this even better
when we give him the good news.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.640
Hey, guys.

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.319
Oh, hell, no!

01:08:40.479 --> 01:08:42.000
Hell, no!

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.920
You know who this man is?
This man is a fucking faggot!

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.640
- Go outside.
- He's your cousin...

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.160
but he sucks dick and takes it in the ass.

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:52.279
Escape this fucking faggot.
Run away from this faggot.

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:54.399
Okay, I'm cool. I'm chilling out.

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.399
I just wanna tell you something.
The man is a terrorist.

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.359
Shut the fuck up, man!
Yeah, I'm not having a good day!

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.000
You're not having a good day?

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.160
- Stop taking it in the ass!
- Go outside.

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:06.640
You'll have a better day.
Osama Bin Cocksucker!

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.120
No, no, you go outside.

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:10.439
- Fuck you, man. Fuck off!
- Fucking faggot!

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.800
- No talk like that.
- You gonna throw me out?

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.240
I come in here every day
and you throw me out?

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:17.479
Excuse me, sir, watch out for the faggots.

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.120
They're all around here.

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:22.120
Faggots are running crazy.

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:43.800
Yo.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.439
Yo.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.440
You pitching or catching?

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.200
Shut the fuck up, dude. Back off.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.760
Hey.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.840
Dick sucker.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.760
What? What?

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.440
Yo, man.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.200
Yo, Bishop?

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.240
Fuck.

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.480
- Fuck.
- Easy, easy.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.160
- Fuck.
- Motherfucker.

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.640
Okay.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.240
Fuck.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.320
- Oh, my... Fuck.
- I'm gonna throw up.

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.200
I'm gonna throw up.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.920
I'm fucked up. I'm all fucked up.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.240
Help me out, dude.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.360
I'm all fucked up.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.880
You're good, man.
We're... You're gonna be good.

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.560
Stay here.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.680
I'm okay.

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.240
Hello, and thank you for calling 311
in New York City.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.360
If this is an emergency, please dial 911.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.200
Cocksucker.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.640
Cool it, dude.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.880
No, man. Fuck!

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.880
Oh, fuck.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.640
Oh, fuck.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.600
Oh, my God.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.360
Help me.

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.600
- Come with me.
- Help me.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.120
I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding.

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.920
Help me. Oh, my God.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.080
Will you help me?

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.160
No, no, no.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.360
No.

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:41.640
- No.
- Fuck. Fuck.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.720
- What happened?
- I fucked up.

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.640
- I fucked up.
- What is that noise?

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.480
- What...?
- It was an accident.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:32.400
- Freddy, what happened?
- I fucked up. It was not my fault.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.240
My God. Freddy, what happened?

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.960
I was walking and then he started outside.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.760
- Okay, okay, okay.
- And he was following me.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.680
Okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.640
- Polly, no.
- Watch out.

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.520
- Polly.
- No, leave him.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:48.800
Motherfucker.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.480
What happened?

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.040
Did you call 911 or an ambulance?
Call somebody.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.200
- I tried calling...
- No, wait, don't.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.640
What happened?

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.200
Oh, fuck.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.800
- Breathe. Just breathe.
- What the fuck is this?

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:03.800
Freddy, explain.
How did he get in the house?

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.400
- I don't know.
- Tell us what happened.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.360
I was coming back, all right? And then...

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:14.080
As I was up here,
he cursed at me and then...

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.000
he started, like, following me and then...

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.840
- And he...
- It's okay, it's okay. Okay, okay, okay.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.160
- I was defending myself.
- I know you were. It was an accident.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.720
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.000
- Motherfucker!
- Calm down. It's okay.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.920
Look, he's not gonna...

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.360
We're gonna call the cops, tell them.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.680
- You cannot call the police.
- We're calling the police.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.400
- People are gonna hear.
- He's gonna get deported...

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.880
- ...you're pregnant. We're not calling.
- What?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.080
- What the fuck? You're pregnant?
- I found out today.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.800
- No.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.320
- No.
- No, it's okay. Listen, listen, listen.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.160
We're gonna fix this, okay?
We should call the police.

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.360
Can you just shut him up?

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.680
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.640
Freddy, what? What are you doing?

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.400
Please don't.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.960
I'm sorry, man.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:09.200
- I'm sorry.
- Stay here, don't call anybody.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.280
Hold him.

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:26.680
- Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!
- Get out!

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.720
Oh, my God.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:31.840
Oh, my...

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.120
Fuck.

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:43.000
Oh, fuck.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.520
Fuck.

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.480
Oh, fuck.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:55.200
No. Dude, what the fuck?

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.480
Oh, my God.

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:07.480
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Oh, my God. Fuck.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.320
Oh, Polly.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:16.160
It was an accident.
We'll fix it. It's okay.

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.200
- Breathe, okay?
- I killed him.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.880
Breathe, okay? Just breathe.

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:23.200
Hey.

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:28.480
- What are we gonna do?
- Sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.920
It's okay. It's okay.

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.360
It was an accident, okay?
You were defending yourself.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.920
It was an accident.

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.320
Oh, fuck.

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.640
Oh, fuck.

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.720
Fuck. Fuck.

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.120
Fuck.

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.600
My God.

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:18.840
My God.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:24.440
You guys, what are we gonna do?

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:26.560
What the fuck?

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.640
What are we gonna do, guys? Fuck.

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.520
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my God.

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.480
I'm sorry.

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:42.960
Who is that? Freddy. Freddy.

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.080
Leave!

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.240
Leave the house!

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.480
What's your problem, man? I need to pee.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.600
Leave! Don't go in the bathroom!

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.640
- Fuck. Fuck.
- I told you, man.

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.120
- What the fuck happened?
- Calm down.

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.840
Sit here.

01:18:58.840 --> 01:18:59.800
Yeah.

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.880
Close your eyes. Close your eyes!

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.680
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:09.920
It's okay, it's okay.

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.640
How...? How...? How did this...?

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.960
He was defending himself, okay?

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.000
It was an accident.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.120
It's okay. Just breathe.

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.720
Okay? Just breathe.

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:51.000
- We have to get him out of here.
- Yeah. How?

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.280
Don't... Fuck.

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.120
Sit down.

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.880
- Who is it?
- Just sit down.

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.800
- Fuck.
- What?

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:12.880
- Dude, it's Richard. He saw me.
- Fuck!

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.200
- Fucking great.
- Maybe he needs something.

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.280
- I'm just gonna go...
- Okay, just...

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.560
Fuck.

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.160
I need to go out. He's gonna keep on...
He saw me.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.880
- Wait, clean up.
- Don't go down.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.640
You've got blood all over you.

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:27.560
- Okay.
- Just tell him we're having dinner.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.840
Tell him we're in the middle of something.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.040
- Hey, how are you, man?
- How are you?

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.080
I'm good. What's going on?

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.080
No. What is going on?

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:45.400
Nothing. But it's... It's really late.

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:49.480
Freddy, I saw Bishop come up the steps.

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:51.200
What's going on?

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.920
Freddy, come on. Let's get real.

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.120
What's wrong?

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.360
Oh, my God.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.280
Don't look. Turn around.

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.280
You go first.

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.760
Tell us, what's the talk of the nation?

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:05.440
Might be a big one, a national story
you've been following for weeks.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:08.000
Because your name's on the pulse. Also...

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.240
Be careful.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:57.720
Freddy, there is a light switch on
the left side of the wall. I'll be right back.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.280
One, two...

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:14.880
Get away.

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.960
- You're still playing with it.
- I'm fat.

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:53.120
- No.
- No, you're still playing with it.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.880
- I'm Michael Feinstein.
- I'll look out.

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:00.560
My guest today
is singer-songwriter, Ryan Bingham.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.600
His sound echoes
the rough and rugged life he's led...

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.840
but his journey borders on the magical.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.840
While working as a rodeo rider,
he took up songwriting...

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.120
in his after-hours.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.360
Released albums that caught the ear
of legendary producer, T Bone Burnett...

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:18.200
who was producing the soundtrack
to the Jeff Bridges film Crazy Heart.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.720
The rest is Grammy-Oscar-winning history.

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:24.200
Ryan Bingham, welcome to Song Travels.

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:27.640
- Thank you very much.
- I really appreciate you being here.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:32.160
I think your work is rather extraordinary
because it's a combination of...

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.040
What was that?

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.960
What?

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.880
Can I stay here, please? Can I sleep here?

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:16.680
- What?
- Can I sleep here?

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.000
What's going on?

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:48.000
Polly.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.080
What the fuck is this?

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.200
- What is that?
- Chino brought them.

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.240
He gave them to me.

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.720
Fucking creeped me out.

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:41.200
These are... Are old prewar...

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.040
Give me one second.

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:48.000
Is it 14, 15 that lives
on the second floor or...?

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:51.000
That's something I have to actually check.

01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:57.920
Aina.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:00.160
- Hey, guys. Hi.
- Hey.

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.640
- Good morning.
- Who's here?

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.960
How you doing?

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.080
- Hey, Arthur.
- Artie, look who's here.

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:09.080
- It's Uncle Freddy.
- What's up, amigo? How you doing?

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:11.280
- God, he's, like, growing a beard.
- Hi.

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:14.440
- Look at that.
- I know. He's getting so big so fast.

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.840
- Where are you guys heading?
- To get coffee.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.320
- Yeah, we're gonna go to Smooch.
- Where's Isaac? Is he back yet?

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:25.720
Yeah, he got back late. Had a long trip,
just passed out. We're just out walking.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.360
You look sleepy.

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:34.520
Yeah. We didn't really sleep.

01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:37.680
- Yeah.
- Really?

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.360
I... Well...

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.080
- That's great.
- Yeah.
