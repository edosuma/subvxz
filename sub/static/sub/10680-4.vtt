00:12.480 --> 00:14.520
[Ken] All right, all right.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.520
Bloody hell.

-[yawns]

00:17.600 --> 00:19.160
Here you go.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.720
Why have you got my post?

00:19.200 --> 00:21.720
Have you been hassling

00:19.200 --> 00:21.720
the postman again?

00:21.760 --> 00:24.640
Well, he says he's a postman

00:21.760 --> 00:24.640
but you can't trust anyone

00:21.760 --> 00:24.640
these days.

00:24.680 --> 00:25.880
Thank you, Tony Blair.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.040
Right then. Bye.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.640
So, um, what are your plans

00:27.080 --> 00:29.640
for your birthday?

00:29.680 --> 00:31.560
It's not my birthday.

00:31.600 --> 00:35.200
You old, wind up merchant.

00:31.600 --> 00:35.200
My idea, you and me hit

00:31.600 --> 00:35.200
the pubs and get shitted!

00:35.240 --> 00:37.440
Like I say, it's not

00:35.240 --> 00:37.440
my birthday.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.320
Then why have I got Ken

00:37.480 --> 00:40.320
written on the palm of my hand?

00:40.360 --> 00:41.880
Because you're insane.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.320
That's weird. I'm normally

00:41.920 --> 00:44.320
spot on with dates.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.720
Funny story about

00:44.360 --> 00:46.720
that. There was

00:44.360 --> 00:46.720
this little...

00:49.600 --> 00:52.480
-[Rachel sighs] Good morning.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.480
-Good morning.

00:52.520 --> 00:56.280
-Happy birthday, dad.

00:52.520 --> 00:56.280
-Ah, thank you.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.120
What's this?

00:57.600 --> 00:59.240
Ow.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.680
Oh, hey, chief Ken.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.680
It's your birthday today.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.680
Happy Birthday.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.000
Thank you.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.000
What are you... doing?

01:04.040 --> 01:05.480
Another all night vigil.

01:05.520 --> 01:07.880
hoping for an email from Ling.

01:05.520 --> 01:07.880
Not one phone call,

01:07.920 --> 01:10.600
not a letter.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.600
Not one email

01:07.920 --> 01:10.600
since I left China.

01:10.640 --> 01:11.920
-Tea?

01:10.640 --> 01:11.920
-Tea.

01:11.960 --> 01:12.760
Yeah.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.840
Oh, is there anything

01:13.760 --> 01:15.840
there for me?

01:15.880 --> 01:17.320
Maybe from Shanghai, China?

01:17.360 --> 01:20.160
No, mate. Just a couple of cards

01:17.360 --> 01:20.160
for the birthday boy.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.200
Huh.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.800
[Lorna] Have you

01:21.240 --> 01:22.800
seen my shoes?

01:22.840 --> 01:26.040
No. Not on this

01:22.840 --> 01:26.040
special morning.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.480
[Lorna] Funny. You know,

01:26.080 --> 01:28.480
my brown ones for work?

01:28.520 --> 01:30.040
Special for

01:28.520 --> 01:30.040
someone, anyway.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.880
Got a ton of meetings

01:30.080 --> 01:32.880
and I've hardly

01:30.080 --> 01:32.880
slept a wink. Ugh!

01:32.920 --> 01:34.640
There they are.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.000
I'm gonna be late back.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.000
I've sterilized Sid's

01:34.680 --> 01:38.000
bottles for you.

01:38.040 --> 01:42.280
What a lovely present.

01:38.040 --> 01:42.280
It must be my birthday.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.520
See you all later.

01:43.800 --> 01:44.760
Bye.

[door opens]

01:50.040 --> 01:53.320
Oh, Ken.

01:50.040 --> 01:53.320
I completely forgot.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.200
Car seat. In case

01:53.360 --> 01:55.200
you want to go out.

Check this out.

Gold-lame birthday banner.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.080
Oho! This is gonna

02:13.440 --> 02:16.080
be the best

02:13.440 --> 02:16.080
birthday ever.

02:16.120 --> 02:19.320
-Right.

02:16.120 --> 02:19.320
-Tonight, we're gonna party

02:16.120 --> 02:19.320
like it's 99 red balloons.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.880
You been listening to

02:19.360 --> 02:21.880
Lorna's CD collection again?

02:21.920 --> 02:23.680
Yeah I have.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.680
Do we put one on?

02:23.720 --> 02:24.680
No. God, no!

02:25.400 --> 02:27.120
Tonight is my night.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.720
As soon as Lorna's home,

02:28.760 --> 02:31.600
we will be having

02:28.760 --> 02:31.600
the holy trinity

02:28.760 --> 02:31.600
of entertainment.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.120

<i>Trivial Pursuit?</i>

02:41.080 --> 02:43.840
What is this?

02:43.880 --> 02:46.760
It's what people

02:43.880 --> 02:46.760
did in the 80s

02:43.880 --> 02:46.760
when they didn't have TV.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.280
It's an incredible general

02:46.800 --> 02:50.280
knowledge quiz.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.280
It's the ultimate test of--

02:50.320 --> 02:53.640
-Evening, Ken.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.640
-Oh, fantastic.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.360
-Where'd you want this?

02:53.680 --> 02:56.360
-Not in my house. What is it?

02:56.400 --> 02:57.680
Fresh batch of home brew.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.760
Not your birthday, eh?

02:57.720 --> 03:00.760
You old rogue!

03:00.800 --> 03:02.480
You and me,

03:00.800 --> 03:02.480
we're gonna neck this

03:02.520 --> 03:05.200

Yes. I'm on it.

The thing is, this is

03:16.080 --> 03:19.280
a quiet occasion, for me

03:16.080 --> 03:19.280
and my family.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.720
I am your family.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.280
You and me are like brothers.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.280
Always ribbing each other.

Busting each other's gonads.

-Sorry about that, love.

03:25.120 --> 03:28.520
How was your day?

03:25.120 --> 03:28.520
-Increasingly disappointing.

03:28.560 --> 03:32.640
I know what you mean.

03:28.560 --> 03:32.640
I've been rushed off my feet.

03:35.160 --> 03:39.280
you didn't forget.

03:39.320 --> 03:43.280
I would never forget

with a new baby

03:43.320 --> 03:46.520
and my current workload,

03:43.320 --> 03:46.520
it would probably

03:43.320 --> 03:46.520
be forgivable?

03:46.560 --> 03:47.640
Would it?

03:47.680 --> 03:50.200

[all] Oh!

04:07.760 --> 04:11.680
Match point. Get this

04:07.760 --> 04:11.680
and we win. Dale, do not

04:07.760 --> 04:11.680
blurt out the answer.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.840
Okay! I just really

04:11.720 --> 04:13.840
want to win.

04:13.880 --> 04:17.960
I know, and if you think you

04:13.880 --> 04:17.960
know it and based on your past

04:13.880 --> 04:17.960
form that's highly unlikely,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.040
-then raise your hand.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.040
-Roger that.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.640

04:26.480 --> 04:29.360
-All right, last chance.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.080
Oho. What's this?

04:31.120 --> 04:33.680
Is it a card

04:31.120 --> 04:33.680
for a certain,

04:31.120 --> 04:33.680
special someone?

04:33.720 --> 04:36.160

Ah.

get this out

04:40.640 --> 04:42.680
of the emergency card

04:40.640 --> 04:42.680
drawer in the bedroom?

04:42.720 --> 04:44.640

It's perfect!

04:56.200 --> 04:58.640
Do you know what

would make this game

Oh, no.

to join my Dojo.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.480
If we get this wrong,

05:29.240 --> 05:31.480
which is highly unlikely

05:31.520 --> 05:32.840
because it's a blue pie

and I... am the maestro

05:32.880 --> 05:37.040
of the blue,

-No.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.360
-All right.

05:42.400 --> 05:48.720
However, if, when, we get

05:42.400 --> 05:48.720
this right, you will

05:42.400 --> 05:48.720
go home, forever.

[Rachel and Dale gasp]

05:53.680 --> 05:54.640
Deal.

-Yes.

-Right, the bet is on.

-You've said that

06:18.440 --> 06:21.200
every single time.

I know. But I lived

06:21.240 --> 06:24.000
in China, Ken.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.080
I know the language,

06:24.040 --> 06:26.080
I know the culture,

I know when

06:26.120 --> 06:28.520
they put the bins out.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.520
It's Thursday.

And more than that,

06:28.560 --> 06:31.840
I know I can give this answer

06:31.880 --> 06:36.360

Fascinating as this is, Dale,

07:06.360 --> 07:09.680
can you please just

07:06.360 --> 07:09.680
tell us an answer?

07:09.720 --> 07:11.080
I'm just about to, chief Ken.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.760
He's stalling. Thinking

07:11.120 --> 07:12.760
I'll give something away.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.680
Well, he's wrong.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.760
I can sit like this

for hours.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.600
Yeah. Well, let's not

07:15.800 --> 07:17.600

Oh, shut up, Dad.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.720
I'm into this.

Plus, after this,

it's<i> The Dam Busters,</i> so...

07:23.640 --> 07:26.120

Take your time, Dale.

07:30.840 --> 07:34.760
Okay. So,

07:30.840 --> 07:34.760
I was in my apartment

<i>I guessed</i>

<i>something really weird.</i>

07:59.800 --> 08:04.640
<i>Each duck had a bag</i>

<i>of white powder</i>

08:04.680 --> 08:09.080
<i>I didn't know what it was,</i>

<i>And waited...</i>

<i>And waited...</i>

08:14.400 --> 08:17.320
<i>I hadn't eaten</i>

08:14.400 --> 08:17.320
<i>a proper meal in days.</i>

08:17.360 --> 08:18.840
<i>to get in trouble,</i>

08:18.880 --> 08:21.680
<i>so I didn't touch</i>

<i>a single duck.</i>

08:21.720 --> 08:26.120
<i>It was late</i>

<i>of what they were saying,</i>

<i>with money and laundering.</i>

<i>that they included</i>

Yeah. Considerate,

08:46.400 --> 08:49.280
right? [chuckles]

08:49.320 --> 08:52.840
The laundry guys were

08:49.320 --> 08:52.840
so pleased I didn't touch

08:49.320 --> 08:52.840

08:52.880 --> 08:56.720

<i>Although there was no way</i>

<i>to tell that at the time.</i>

<i>And behind Mr Zee,</i>

<i>His daughter, Ling.</i>

Maybe you could

just skip this stuff.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.640
-Oh, but Ling's the reason

09:28.880 --> 09:31.640
I know the answer.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.640
-Oh.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.320
Well, Ling and the chicken.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.560
The chicken?

09:34.600 --> 09:36.600
Is that the answer then?

09:34.600 --> 09:36.600
The year of the chicken?

09:36.640 --> 09:40.040
Wrong! I win. Yes!

09:36.640 --> 09:40.040
Come on.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.360
That wasn't our answer.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.360
I was conferring with Dale.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.640
Yeah. It's not the year

09:42.400 --> 09:44.640
of the chicken.

09:44.680 --> 09:47.480
Actually, the chicken's

09:44.680 --> 09:47.480
kind of a surprise

-Just get on with it.

So, I'll just skip the stuff

09:50.360 --> 09:53.200
about Ling being so beautiful,

09:53.240 --> 09:55.160
I forgot

[Dale] I mean...

The first time I saw

Connie was at a debate

09:59.000 --> 10:02.720

Typical Connie, really.

Pro-hanging.

10:09.760 --> 10:12.320
We compromised

10:09.760 --> 10:12.320
on lethal injection.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.800
Life was much simpler then.

10:16.520 --> 10:17.640
Fucking hell.

[burps]

10:23.360 --> 10:27.080
Anyways, um, so Mr. Zee

10:23.360 --> 10:27.080
had come to offer me a job.

10:29.320 --> 10:33.960

10:29.320 --> 10:33.960
<i>I had to pass a test.</i>

10:34.000 --> 10:37.240
<i>They placed a strange</i>

<i>object on the table.</i>

10:37.280 --> 10:39.040
<i>It looked like a cage</i>

10:39.080 --> 10:41.320
<i>but what animal</i>

10:39.080 --> 10:41.320
<i>could be inside?</i>

10:41.360 --> 10:42.640
[Ken]<i> A chicken?</i>

10:42.680 --> 10:46.640

10:46.680 --> 10:50.440
<i>Anyways, I wasn't</i>

<i>sure what I was</i>

<i>supposed to do.</i>

10:50.480 --> 10:53.400

<i>the chicken was</i>

10:50.480 --> 10:53.400
<i>super sacred to them.</i>

Hi, Mr. Chicken.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.520

ago when I was part of a cult.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.080
I thought

11:41.560 --> 11:43.080
it was all above board,

11:43.120 --> 11:45.760
but it turns out

11:43.120 --> 11:45.760
it was quite

11:43.120 --> 11:45.760

12:05.720 --> 12:08.600
-Not now you're not.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.000
Right. I'm going to google

12:10.400 --> 12:13.000
the answer so we

12:10.400 --> 12:13.000
can get rid of him.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.200
Relax, chief Ken.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.200
I've got this.

12:15.240 --> 12:18.320
Yes, but just in case,

where's my phone?

I've got that too.

Oh, god.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.560
[Rachel] You all right, mum?

12:46.600 --> 12:48.960
I hid some jaffa cakes somewhere

12:46.600 --> 12:48.960
when I was pregnant.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Maybe if I stick a candle

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
in one of them?

12:52.040 --> 12:53.760
I dunno. Maybe?

13:11.440 --> 13:14.920
How's your job with Nina?

13:14.960 --> 13:17.120
Well, Nina's mental, obviously.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.160
I think if I could

13:17.160 --> 13:19.160
change one thing though,

13:19.200 --> 13:21.320
it would be Dale

<i>my way in life with no head.</i>

21:33.440 --> 21:36.840
<i>I had no clue what to say</i>

21:33.440 --> 21:36.840
<i>and I racked my brain</i>

21:33.440 --> 21:36.840
<i>for inspiration.</i>

21:38.560 --> 21:40.480
<i>What could cause</i>

21:38.560 --> 21:40.480
<i>a scar like that?</i>

21:44.320 --> 21:46.720
<i>I'd heard him say he'd</i>

21:44.320 --> 21:46.720
<i>grown up by the sea</i>

21:46.760 --> 21:49.280
<i>and that he'd often go</i>

21:46.760 --> 21:49.280
<i>swimming there.</i>

21:56.280 --> 21:58.200
You answer, now!

22:01.720 --> 22:06.080
<i>She mouthed the words</i>

22:01.720 --> 22:06.080
<i>"Stin Ree," which I think</i>

22:01.720 --> 22:06.080
<i>means good luck.</i>

22:13.520 --> 22:16.040
All right! I am ready

22:13.520 --> 22:16.040
to give my answer.

22:17.280 --> 22:20.080
It has something

22:17.280 --> 22:20.080
to do with the ocean.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.360
Something very dangerous.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.240
You got your scar...

22:32.200 --> 22:33.640
water skiing!

22:35.200 --> 22:36.360
Yeah...

22:38.600 --> 22:40.400
[laughing]

22:40.440 --> 22:42.880
[speaking in Mandarin]

22:40.440 --> 22:42.880
He's an idiot, but I like him.

22:44.680 --> 22:48.040
<i>I'd guessed correctly.</i>

22:44.680 --> 22:48.040
<i>And Mr. Zee was as good</i>

22:44.680 --> 22:48.040
<i>as his word.</i>

22:48.080 --> 22:52.280
<i>The next day, I was officially</i>

22:48.080 --> 22:52.280
<i>welcomed into the family</i>

22:48.080 --> 22:52.280
<i>and made a delivery boy.</i>

22:53.320 --> 22:55.160
[laughing]

22:56.680 --> 22:59.440
So, I learned

22:56.680 --> 22:59.440
a valuable lesson that day.

22:59.480 --> 23:02.280
In fact, I learned 12 of them

22:59.480 --> 23:02.280
which I will now explain.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.160
First lesson--

23:03.200 --> 23:05.400
No. Enough is enough.

23:05.440 --> 23:06.560
Steve, ask the question.

23:06.600 --> 23:11.240
Here we go. Get this right

23:06.600 --> 23:11.240
and you win the bet.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.240
Get this wrong and

23:11.280 --> 23:14.240
the Lichfield

23:11.280 --> 23:14.240
mixed martial arts center

23:14.280 --> 23:17.400
gets a 6 foot 8

23:14.280 --> 23:17.400
white belt with

23:14.280 --> 23:17.400
a heart of gold.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.000
Just get on with it.

23:19.040 --> 23:23.080
Okay, so what animal comes

23:19.040 --> 23:23.080
after the horse

23:19.040 --> 23:23.080
in the Chinese calendar?

23:27.560 --> 23:29.160
[suspenseful music]

23:30.680 --> 23:31.840
The monkey!

23:33.080 --> 23:34.320
It's wrong.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.440
It's, it's the goat.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.320
What?

23:37.360 --> 23:38.720
The goat! [laughs]

23:38.760 --> 23:40.240
How about that?

23:38.760 --> 23:40.240
It's the goat!

23:40.280 --> 23:41.800
[Steve and Dale laughing]

23:41.840 --> 23:43.240
So what was the point

23:41.840 --> 23:43.240
of that story?

23:43.280 --> 23:46.760
There was a moral, chief Ken.

23:43.280 --> 23:46.760
Did you not see it?

23:46.800 --> 23:49.400
Sometimes you

23:46.800 --> 23:49.400
just gotta guess.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.040
[Lorna and Steve chuckling]

23:52.080 --> 23:55.200
Well, thank you, Confucius!

23:55.240 --> 23:58.320
So, Judo is Tuesdays

23:55.240 --> 23:58.320
and Thursday nights

23:55.240 --> 23:58.320
in the scout hut.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.120
Thursdays is full contact,

23:58.360 --> 24:00.120
so you have to pad up.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.960
Go home, Steve.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.560
Before that, I'm going

24:02.000 --> 24:04.560
to have to come round

24:02.000 --> 24:04.560
and just test your reactions.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.520
Just really to see what kind

24:04.600 --> 24:07.520
of fighting skills you have.

24:07.560 --> 24:10.280
I'm sensing probably

24:07.560 --> 24:10.280
quite low level

24:10.320 --> 24:12.640
but don't worry,

24:10.320 --> 24:12.640
I'll take you through it.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.240
I've got something

24:20.600 --> 24:22.240
for you.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.360
It's not curry, is it?

24:23.400 --> 24:25.560
Not this time of night,

24:23.400 --> 24:25.560
you great trougher.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.360
[gasps]

24:29.400 --> 24:32.720
Lorn! An evening

24:29.400 --> 24:32.720
with Simon Schama.

24:32.760 --> 24:34.160
It's in London

24:32.760 --> 24:34.160
next month.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.920
I thought we could

24:34.200 --> 24:36.920
make a weekend of it.

24:36.960 --> 24:39.000
Aww. Thank you.

24:40.040 --> 24:42.000
Oh. So, no<i> Dam Busters</i> then?

24:42.040 --> 24:45.280
Eh. Survived the Nazis,

24:42.040 --> 24:45.280
killed by a bell end.

24:45.320 --> 24:46.280
Huh.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.720
Guess what guys?

24:46.320 --> 24:49.720
I got a surprise.

24:49.760 --> 24:53.080
I felt really bad

24:49.760 --> 24:53.080
about earlier,

24:49.760 --> 24:53.080
so I got another cake.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.920
Also, the guy in the shop

24:53.120 --> 24:55.920
said if we were

24:53.120 --> 24:55.920
having a party

24:55.960 --> 24:57.000
we could use

24:55.960 --> 24:57.000
some of these things.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.040
[Lorna and Rachel] Whoo!

24:58.080 --> 24:59.320
That's really nice, Dale,

24:59.360 --> 25:01.320
but I think we should all

24:59.360 --> 25:01.320
probably head to bed.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.080
-Oh, Dad.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.080
-Ken.

25:03.120 --> 25:03.920
[sighs]

25:05.280 --> 25:06.920
What sort

25:05.280 --> 25:06.920
of cake is it?

25:06.960 --> 25:07.760
[chuckles]

25:10.680 --> 25:11.760
White chocolate.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.080
-[Lorna] I'll get some plates.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.080
-Good.

25:15.480 --> 25:17.280
What?

25:17.320 --> 25:21.600
I dunno, it's just...

25:17.320 --> 25:21.600
my whole life I've been

25:17.320 --> 25:21.600
part of different families,

25:21.640 --> 25:23.920
each with their own

25:21.640 --> 25:23.920
way of doing things.

25:23.960 --> 25:26.480
Vashradi told us

25:23.960 --> 25:26.480
to intercourse

25:23.960 --> 25:26.480
with aliens.

25:26.520 --> 25:29.520
Mr. Zee chopped

25:26.520 --> 25:29.520
people's tongues off

25:26.520 --> 25:29.520
for telling lies.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.960
And you like the dishwasher

25:29.560 --> 25:31.960
on economy cycle.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.040
[both chuckling]

25:33.080 --> 25:34.440
It's hard

25:33.080 --> 25:34.440
to tell who's got it right.

25:35.240 --> 25:36.880
I do know this.

25:36.920 --> 25:41.000
The only place

25:36.920 --> 25:41.000
I've ever felt at home

25:36.920 --> 25:41.000
is right here.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.160
That's very sweet, Dale,

25:41.040 --> 25:43.160
but I am British,

25:43.200 --> 25:44.840
so take it down a notch.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.960
You've really been

25:44.880 --> 25:46.960
like a dad to me, chief Ken.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.600
Maybe a notch more.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.560
I'm gonna miss you

25:48.640 --> 25:50.560
when I go back to China.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.920
-No. Not that.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.920
-Okay.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.960
[door bell ringing]

26:00.000 --> 26:03.680
[gasps] She did

26:00.000 --> 26:03.680
get me a curry. Ha, ha!

26:06.840 --> 26:08.040
Ha!

26:08.080 --> 26:09.760
[both shouting] Ahh!

26:09.800 --> 26:12.240
[theme music playing]
