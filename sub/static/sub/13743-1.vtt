00:41.670 --> 00:44.228
<i>Try and try</i>

00:44.336 --> 00:46.734

00:53.937 --> 00:57.426
<i>Persecution you must bear</i>

00:57.537 --> 01:01.265
<i>Win or lose
you've got to get your share</i>

01:01.372 --> 01:04.668
<i>Got your mind set on a dream</i>

<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

01:23.639 --> 01:25.537
What's that?
It stopped?

01:25.639 --> 01:28.662
- Bus crash.
- Well, driver, don't move!

01:33.240 --> 01:36.798
<i>You carry a lovely mango from country.
You have any more?</i>

01:36.940 --> 01:40.429
- Taking this for my mother.
- Put it up.

01:40.574 --> 01:42.904
<i>You'll succeed at last</i>

01:45.041 --> 01:47.303

<i>Opposition will come your way</i>

01:57.308 --> 02:01.070
<i>But the harder the bat received</i>

02:01.175 --> 02:05.073

02:58.779 --> 03:02.405
Hey, country boy, move!

03:02.513 --> 03:05.479
Wait a minute, man.
You know the way to Milk Lane?

03:05.580 --> 03:08.307
You have money?
If you have money, go anywhere at all.

03:08.413 --> 03:12.141
But if you don't have money,
you're fucked. Better you stay at home.

03:12.247 --> 03:14.611
<i>- All right, how much?
- Give me 50 cents and help me push.</i>

03:36.482 --> 03:39.108
Hey, it's a red light.
That means stop.

03:39.216 --> 03:41.842
That's why country boys,
they get killed.

03:41.949 --> 03:44.676
<i>Did you hear that
Express yourself</i>

03:44.782 --> 03:46.771
Hey, Winston!

03:47.883 --> 03:50.576
You know that bitch
owes me money.

03:50.683 --> 03:53.706
Hey, give me back my money!

03:53.850 --> 03:56.816
Go after him. Go after him.

04:07.684 --> 04:10.844
Hey, the guy over there
sent me for his money.

04:12.218 --> 04:14.548
He say you have the money, man.
Where's the guy now?

04:14.651 --> 04:17.879
<i>Bye, bye, bye Good gracious</i>

04:17.985 --> 04:19.974
<i>Stop that train
I want to get off</i>

04:23.219 --> 04:25.811
Hey, come back here, man!
Give me my things, man!

04:27.519 --> 04:30.417
Come back here, man!

04:30.519 --> 04:32.849
<i>Stop that train</i>

04:32.953 --> 04:37.579
<i>- I want to get off
- Where you goin', man? Where you goin'?</i>

04:39.686 --> 04:42.244
<i>Goodness gracious</i>

05:03.554 --> 05:06.281
What's that?
How much you have?

05:06.388 --> 05:08.820
Two. Owe this to your partner.

05:10.589 --> 05:13.680
You know if this lady
live around here?

05:13.789 --> 05:16.653
Oh, over there.

05:19.989 --> 05:21.978
- My play?
- Yeah.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.987
Let me draw!

05:24.089 --> 05:28.647
Ivan.
All right, come inside.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.816
- You sick, Momma?
- Yes.

05:34.957 --> 05:39.253
I wonder your grandmother when you
leave. What you come to town for?

05:39.357 --> 05:41.823
Grandma dead.

05:41.957 --> 05:45.390
Dead? How she can be
and I never knew?

05:45.491 --> 05:49.514
We tried to get you,
but the telegram came back.

05:49.624 --> 05:52.590
- And when she going to bury?
- She buried already, Momma.

05:52.691 --> 05:57.589
<i>Bury already? Buried already,
and I never got to go to the funeral?</i>

05:57.692 --> 06:01.454
<i>Oh, God! Oh, God!</i>

06:01.558 --> 06:04.547
Don't cry. Don't cry.

06:04.692 --> 06:07.158
<i>Don't you cry.</i>

06:07.259 --> 06:09.555
<i>Oh, God.</i>

06:13.559 --> 06:15.991
And what happened to the place?

06:16.093 --> 06:19.059
Grandma sold the place
before she died.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.626
And what happened to the money?

06:21.726 --> 06:24.352
She said she wanted a big funeral.

06:24.460 --> 06:28.916
And she took all the money for her big
funeral, and I didn't even get to go?

06:29.028 --> 06:31.654
Then the money finished?

06:31.761 --> 06:33.852
A little bit left.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.950
Well, don't you have it?

06:37.061 --> 06:38.959
Yes, I do.

06:47.928 --> 06:50.224
<i>- It's all that is left?
- Yes.</i>

06:53.429 --> 06:56.623
Then how are you gonna get
back to country tonight?

06:56.729 --> 06:58.991
I'm not going back.

06:59.096 --> 07:03.825
<i>Then where are you going? You can't
stay here, because I can't help you.</i>

07:03.929 --> 07:08.123
- I'm staying in town.
- You think town is easy? How you gonna live?

07:08.230 --> 07:12.458
I could make a record.
I can sing, you know, Momma.

07:12.597 --> 07:15.654
You take this thing for a joke?

07:15.797 --> 07:18.059
Well, I can get a job, then.

07:18.164 --> 07:21.756
What kind of job you can get,
other than a criminal?

07:21.864 --> 07:25.524
Why you say a thing like that?
Why you say a thing like that about me?

07:25.631 --> 07:29.563
Don't ask me any questions.
Go back to country.

07:34.898 --> 07:38.058
All right.
Since you're determined,

07:38.165 --> 07:41.825
I will give you the name of a person
who will try and help you.

07:43.999 --> 07:47.557
If you behave yourself,
he may try and get a local job for you.

07:50.766 --> 07:52.732
See it here?

07:55.066 --> 07:58.157
- Preacher?
- Yes.

07:58.266 --> 08:00.357
Him can help you.

08:03.501 --> 08:05.433
Okay, Momma.

08:05.534 --> 08:08.625
And you didn't even bring me
a mango from country?

08:08.734 --> 08:11.326
Mango season was bad this year.

08:17.035 --> 08:18.592
I've got three on this.

08:34.835 --> 08:37.767
- Where's... Which four is that?
- Yeah.

08:40.336 --> 08:43.860
One blank, down there so.

08:43.970 --> 08:46.765
Did you find Daisy?

08:46.870 --> 08:48.802
Yeah.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.960
You just come from the country?

08:51.070 --> 08:53.229
Yes.

08:53.370 --> 08:55.928
- You pass?
- Yeah, your play.

08:59.238 --> 09:02.261
Five.
Your old lady?

09:05.671 --> 09:09.933
So you sell your land in country
and come back to town?

09:10.039 --> 09:12.198
Can call it that.

09:12.305 --> 09:16.294
So you mean.
So you mean.

09:16.406 --> 09:21.237
Your play, man! Don't laugh, boy.

09:25.706 --> 09:31.333
<i>I don't wanna play another game until you pay
me that 50 cents. You owe me too much now.</i>

09:31.473 --> 09:35.405
I can't pay you
till tomorrow, you know.

09:35.507 --> 09:40.099
Too much action around town for me
to play with people who cannot pay.

09:40.207 --> 09:42.105
What's showing at Rialto?

09:42.207 --> 09:44.696
What do you know about Rialto,
just come from country?

09:44.807 --> 09:47.330
I read about it, man.

09:47.441 --> 09:49.771
- So you want to go to Rialto?
- Yes.

09:49.875 --> 09:52.137
- Come then, now.
- I come with you?

09:52.241 --> 09:54.139
<i>Yes, man.</i>

10:34.444 --> 10:37.877
Shut your mouth! The hero
can't die until the last reel.

10:38.011 --> 10:40.977
Him think hero can't die
until the last reel.

10:49.845 --> 10:52.073
<i>Shoot them! Come on!</i>

11:25.181 --> 11:29.705
I ask you, you know?
I ask you to try beginner's luck.

11:50.716 --> 11:52.739
<i>Get your hits from Hilton's.</i>

11:52.949 --> 11:55.040
<i>See Hilton's for records,
record players,</i>

11:55.150 --> 11:57.048
<i>radios, musical instruments,</i>

11:57.150 --> 12:00.048
<i>and every sound around
from beat to Bach and back.</i>

12:00.150 --> 12:02.446
<i>Hilton's has everything in music.</i>

12:03.850 --> 12:05.839
Hilton!

12:05.950 --> 12:08.212
Mr. Hilton!

12:10.618 --> 12:12.641
<i>Mr. Hilton!</i>

12:25.018 --> 12:28.109
Mr. Hilton. Mr. Hilton.
Mr. Hilton.

12:28.218 --> 12:31.480
From morning, we've been here waiting
for you. From 11:00, we've been here.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.847
- What about?
- Mr. Kenton sent me.

12:33.952 --> 12:37.214
- Oh. You have a tune?
- I have a tune, yes.

12:37.319 --> 12:39.581
Sing it for me, then.

12:50.154 --> 12:53.348
We are all one big brother

12:53.454 --> 12:56.443
All belong to one father

12:56.554 --> 12:59.577
You tread on one
you hurt another

12:59.687 --> 13:02.847
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

13:02.954 --> 13:05.852
<i>We were fresh and perfect, see</i>

13:05.954 --> 13:08.681
Made to live in unity

13:08.788 --> 13:11.311
Let peace be your motto...

13:11.422 --> 13:14.684
Uh, that's all right, all right.
I can't use it. Too slow.

13:26.423 --> 13:28.685
<i>- Where you used to work?
- Morrison.</i>

13:28.790 --> 13:31.018
<i>- What kind of work you do?
- Carpenter work.</i>

13:31.123 --> 13:33.180
All right,
go and see Mr. Jackson.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.813
<i>Next. What can you do?</i>

13:35.923 --> 13:38.412
- I can do anything you want, sir.
- Can you pour concrete?

13:38.524 --> 13:41.422
- You can do carpentry work?
- I never did it before...

13:41.524 --> 13:44.547
- You can be a mason? You can paint?
- I can do it, you know?

13:44.657 --> 13:47.589
- Just give me a break.
- What do you mean? "Give me a break."

13:47.690 --> 13:51.123
- We want skilled people.
- Just give me a break.

13:51.258 --> 13:53.622
Give you a break?
Leave the place, man.

13:53.758 --> 13:56.156
Next.

13:56.258 --> 14:00.452
<i>You again? Didn't I
run you yesterday? Leave, man.</i>

14:00.558 --> 14:03.319
<i>- Leave the place.
- I can work as well as the next man, sir.</i>

14:03.426 --> 14:05.017
<i>Leave the place.</i>

14:21.093 --> 14:25.048
<i>Many rivers to cross</i>

14:26.427 --> 14:30.951
<i>But I can't seem to find</i>

14:31.093 --> 14:34.116
<i>- My way over
- How do you do?</i>

14:35.728 --> 14:38.592
- What are you doing there?
- I'm looking for work.

14:38.694 --> 14:41.286
I don't have any work to give you.

14:41.394 --> 14:43.451
I could wash your car,
you know, ma'am.

14:43.561 --> 14:45.857
My husband gets the car
washed downtown.

14:45.961 --> 14:47.893
I could do your gardening.

14:47.995 --> 14:51.155
Look, we have a gardening
service to do that.

14:53.328 --> 14:55.760
I can do anything,
you know, ma'am. Anything.

14:55.862 --> 14:59.954
Look, there's nothing you can do
for me. Nothing you can do for me.

15:00.096 --> 15:03.392
Beg you for ten cents then, ma'am.

15:03.496 --> 15:05.962
What's the matter
with you young, healthy boys?

15:06.063 --> 15:08.461
All you know to do
is beg, beg, beg.

15:08.563 --> 15:10.961
That's all you can do, just beg?

15:11.064 --> 15:14.326
<i>- How you got in here, anyway?
- The gate was open, ma'am.</i>

15:14.430 --> 15:18.294
<i>Well, when you go outside, you
make sure you lock the gate behind you.</i>

15:28.397 --> 15:30.295
Who left the gate open?

15:30.398 --> 15:34.854
<i>Wandering, I am lost</i>

15:34.998 --> 15:39.488
<i>As I travel along</i>

15:39.632 --> 15:42.598
<i>The White Cliffs of Dover</i>

15:44.466 --> 15:48.626
<i>Many rivers to cross</i>

15:48.733 --> 15:53.291
<i>And it's only my will</i>

15:53.399 --> 15:56.729
<i>That keeps me alive</i>

15:58.333 --> 16:03.197
<i>I've been licked
washed up for years</i>

16:03.300 --> 16:07.562
<i>And I merely survived</i>

16:07.700 --> 16:10.393
<i>Because of my pride</i>

16:14.034 --> 16:17.966
<i>And this loneliness
won't leave me alone</i>

16:20.768 --> 16:24.632
<i>It's such a drag
to be on your own</i>

16:27.668 --> 16:31.862
<i>My woman left
and she didn't say why</i>

16:34.836 --> 16:39.030
<i>And I guess I'll have to cry</i>

16:40.569 --> 16:45.127
<i>- Many rivers to cross
- Rivers to cross</i>

16:45.270 --> 16:49.134
<i>But just where to begin</i>

16:49.236 --> 16:53.464
<i>I play for time</i>

16:53.570 --> 16:55.968
<i>- There'll be times
- Many</i>

16:56.071 --> 16:59.367
<i>- I find myself
- Rivers to cross</i>

16:59.471 --> 17:01.403
<i>Thinking of...</i>

17:01.504 --> 17:04.867
You got ten cents, master? I was
watching your car while you was away.

17:04.971 --> 17:09.063
- No, man. The steward always look after my car, man.
- He's not here all the time.

17:09.172 --> 17:12.468
If you want the ten cents,
go beg the steward.

17:16.771 --> 17:19.670
All right.
What you doing here?

17:19.771 --> 17:21.738
Get out, man. Get out.

17:21.872 --> 17:25.202
Get out, man!
Get outta here.

17:28.739 --> 17:36.730
Just a closer walk with Thee

17:36.840 --> 17:43.603
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea

17:43.707 --> 17:47.730
Daily walking

17:47.874 --> 17:51.738
- Close to Thee
- Close to Thee

17:51.841 --> 17:56.536
Let it be, Dear Lord

17:56.641 --> 18:00.835
Let it be

18:00.941 --> 18:05.169
Just a closer walk with Thee

18:05.275 --> 18:07.537
Closer walk with Thee

18:07.642 --> 18:11.268
Love me, Jesus

18:11.376 --> 18:15.672
<i>- Is my plea
- Is my plea</i>

18:15.776 --> 18:19.231
<i>Daily walking</i>

18:19.376 --> 18:22.774
- Close to Thee
- Close to Thee

18:22.876 --> 18:27.536
<i>Let it be, Dear Lord</i>

18:27.644 --> 18:33.339
Let it be

18:54.045 --> 18:56.534
- Morning, Longa.
- Morning, Preacher.

18:58.179 --> 19:00.771
- Morning, young man.
- Morning, Preacher.

19:00.879 --> 19:03.402
- How're you gettin' along?
- Not too bad, sir.

19:03.512 --> 19:05.410
I'll be back in a while.

19:17.313 --> 19:20.006
Hey, pretty boy.

19:20.114 --> 19:23.171
Pretty hat.

19:23.281 --> 19:25.645
Johnny Too Bad.

19:25.781 --> 19:27.747
Bring me the hammer.

19:27.881 --> 19:30.040
What, you can't get it yourself?

19:30.181 --> 19:32.545
No, man.
You bring it for me.

19:38.649 --> 19:41.309
You have on pretty hat
this morning.

19:41.415 --> 19:43.381
You like it?

19:43.482 --> 19:46.243
You really look
like Johnny Too Bad.

19:46.348 --> 19:50.008
You only need a gun
to look like Johnny.

19:50.116 --> 19:52.843
But before you get a gun,

19:52.949 --> 19:56.006
get the broom and come
sweep out the shop.

19:58.349 --> 20:01.440
I look like a preacher
right now?

20:01.583 --> 20:05.141
Get the broom and sweep out the shop.
You are a little boy.

20:27.885 --> 20:30.511
Hi. What happening?
Can't see you.

20:30.618 --> 20:35.516
You don't want to see me. What happened
to you at choir practice last night?

20:37.086 --> 20:39.143
What happened?
Did you miss me?

20:39.286 --> 20:41.184
Personally, no.

20:41.286 --> 20:45.184
But crusades start next week,
and Preacher's asking for you.

20:45.286 --> 20:48.150
Why are you calling him Preacher?
Don't he's your father?

20:48.253 --> 20:50.185
- No.
- Oh.

20:50.287 --> 20:53.276
Why you say it like that?

20:53.387 --> 20:55.285
Nothing.

20:55.387 --> 20:58.979
He's my guardian,
ever since my father and mother died.

20:59.088 --> 21:01.781
That's why he's
so strict with you.

21:01.887 --> 21:04.717
It's for my own good.
Excuse me.

21:07.154 --> 21:10.587
- Who this bicycle frame belong to?
- Preacher.

21:10.688 --> 21:13.813
- You think he'd want it?
- Don't have no use.

21:13.922 --> 21:18.446
I can fix it up.
Maybe you and I could go for a ride.

21:18.556 --> 21:21.283
I don't think so, you know?

21:21.389 --> 21:23.514
<i>Just a ride.</i>

21:23.622 --> 21:26.782
- Perhaps. Depends.
- Depends on what?

21:26.889 --> 21:31.618
If you're a true Christian.
The rest of boys too rude.

21:31.722 --> 21:34.211
Some Christians rude too.

21:34.323 --> 21:36.755
I don't know about that.

21:39.023 --> 21:42.717
<i>El numero uno has arrived!</i>

21:49.924 --> 21:53.357
I know you're playing
in Preacher's garden.

21:53.458 --> 21:57.754
You know, Preacher tend that little
cherry tree for a long time now.

21:57.858 --> 22:01.790
When fruit ripe,
if Preacher don't pick it,

22:01.891 --> 22:04.380
I feel I will pick it.

22:04.492 --> 22:08.084
Look like it's ripe too.

22:09.992 --> 22:14.015
"Consider the lilies
of the field, how they grow.

22:14.259 --> 22:18.749
<i>"They toil not,
neither do they spin.</i>

22:18.892 --> 22:23.723
"And yet I say unto you,
that even Solomon in all his glory...

22:23.827 --> 22:26.588
"was unarrayed like one of these.

22:26.693 --> 22:31.285
<i>"Wherefore, if God so clothed
the grass of the field,</i>

22:31.394 --> 22:35.190
<i>"which today is, and tomorrow
is cast into the oven,</i>

22:35.294 --> 22:38.988
"shall He not much more clothe you,

22:39.095 --> 22:41.391
<i>O ye of little faith?"</i>

22:41.494 --> 22:44.619
<i>Brothers and sisters,
before you leave,</i>

22:44.761 --> 22:47.989
I'd like to inform you
that you won't be able...

22:48.128 --> 22:50.458
<i>to pick up your records
for the rally today.</i>

22:50.562 --> 22:53.858
<i>The master record
has not arrived from America.</i>

22:53.962 --> 22:56.928
<i>I'll let you know about that
during the course of the week.</i>

22:57.029 --> 23:02.189
Now let us stand
and sing and praise.

23:02.296 --> 23:05.626
Be guided poor lost sinner

23:05.729 --> 23:08.957
Before the Lord inform

23:09.063 --> 23:12.086
And in the name of Jesus

23:12.197 --> 23:15.459
A pardon He'll perform

23:15.564 --> 23:18.860
He heard Thy supplication

23:18.996 --> 23:22.087
And soon the weak were strong

23:22.230 --> 23:25.685
For Jesus took my burden

23:25.831 --> 23:28.922
And left me with a song

23:29.031 --> 23:32.259
Yes, Jesus took my burden

23:32.364 --> 23:35.194
I could not help Him bear

23:35.298 --> 23:39.026
Yes, Jesus took my burden

23:39.132 --> 23:42.189
He answered to my prayer

23:42.299 --> 23:45.527
He answers prayers I'm certain

23:45.632 --> 23:48.928
My spirit was made strong

23:49.032 --> 23:51.624
For Jesus took my burden

23:51.766 --> 23:57.324
And left me with a song

24:11.468 --> 24:13.366
<i>Who turned off...</i>

24:13.468 --> 24:16.866
I did. You're gonna make the Lord
come back and find you doing this?

24:16.967 --> 24:20.525
<i>- Doing what, Preacher? - Boogie-woogie
and twistin' up yourself in my yard.</i>

24:20.634 --> 24:23.566
They don't have boogie-woogie
anymore, Preacher.

24:23.668 --> 24:28.828
I don't care what you want to call it!
I don't want it in my yard.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.866
All right, Preacher.
I'm finished for the night, sir.

24:39.502 --> 24:44.162
And furthermore, what are you
doing here at this time of night?

24:44.269 --> 24:46.895
- I was fixing the bicycle.
- Fixing your bicycle?

24:47.002 --> 24:50.435
You should be reading your Bible.
Reading your Bible!

24:50.536 --> 24:54.400
You hear what I tell you?
Reading your Bible three times a day!

24:54.504 --> 24:57.493
- All right.
- Don't walk away from me. You're impertinent!

24:57.637 --> 25:01.263
<i>- You're rude! Don't have respect!
- Preacher on the warpath tonight.</i>

25:01.404 --> 25:05.860
- I wonder why.
- Must've noticed what we noticed.

25:06.004 --> 25:08.630
What has Preacher
got to do with that?

25:08.737 --> 25:11.295
Preacher is a man
of the Lord, but still...

25:11.405 --> 25:13.667
He is a man, all the same.

25:13.772 --> 25:16.261
And the Lord say,
"Go ye forth and multiply,"

25:16.371 --> 25:18.269
and Preacher don't multiply yet.

25:18.371 --> 25:20.394
Preacher has been my guardian,

25:20.505 --> 25:23.403
and he will always
be my guardian, and that's that.

25:23.506 --> 25:28.803
- When nothing else could help...
- Yes!

25:28.905 --> 25:33.860
- Then love came down!
- Amen!

25:34.006 --> 25:38.496
It rescued the perishing!

25:38.639 --> 25:41.366
Cared for the dying!

25:41.474 --> 25:44.702
Snatched us from iniquity!

25:44.807 --> 25:48.467
Raise us from the grave!

25:48.574 --> 25:51.631
Tonight, here is love!

25:51.674 --> 25:54.232
Praise God!

25:54.341 --> 25:57.466
- We say it is a gift of God!
- Amen!

25:57.575 --> 26:02.940
Amen! Tonight,
the wages of sin is coming!

26:03.042 --> 26:07.099
It's death!
It's damnation!

26:07.242 --> 26:11.572
It's derogation!
But here is the love of God!

26:11.676 --> 26:14.938
<i>- Here!
- Love worketh no end!</i>

26:15.043 --> 26:17.407
Love thinketh no evil!

26:17.509 --> 26:21.839
Love never fails to accept,
not even if provoked!

26:21.943 --> 26:25.341
Praise God!
Let us give thanks to Jesus!

26:25.443 --> 26:28.103
- Thank you, Jesus!
- Let's alleluia!

26:28.210 --> 26:31.267
- Alleluia! Alleluia!
- Let's praise Him!

28:57.121 --> 28:59.019
- Longa?
- Yes, Preacher?

28:59.121 --> 29:02.610
- Where is that boy?
- I don't know, Preacher. He might be in his automobile.

29:02.720 --> 29:04.948
His automobile, huh?

30:18.025 --> 30:20.014
And where have you been?

30:20.126 --> 30:22.024
I just been for a ride, sir.

30:22.127 --> 30:24.719
You've been skylarking,
and I can't find you?

30:24.826 --> 30:27.190
All I can find is this
nastiness in the place.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.191
And you get into the house.

30:29.293 --> 30:31.691
Do you know how long
we've been waiting for this?

30:31.827 --> 30:34.725
If we don't get to the studio,
we won't have any records for the rally.

30:34.827 --> 30:37.793
- I can take it right now.
- By the time you get there, it will be closed.

30:37.927 --> 30:39.825
I can take it down
right now, sir.

30:39.927 --> 30:42.654
And be sure you come back
in a hurry.

30:44.027 --> 30:48.016
Auntie in her room cry

30:48.228 --> 30:50.989
My mama said she must wipe her eye

30:51.095 --> 30:53.459
Mama's such a lovely fool in life

30:53.561 --> 30:56.550
She never been to school
in all her days

30:56.661 --> 31:01.559
No wonder he's a perfect partner

31:01.662 --> 31:07.391
While they were dancing
in that ballroom last night

31:07.529 --> 31:10.825
Just a little rumor, friends

31:10.929 --> 31:13.361
My uncle say he must work her in

31:13.463 --> 31:16.156
And he's such a lovely
a fool in life

31:16.263 --> 31:19.093
It's not time for his wedding day

31:19.196 --> 31:24.219
It's no wonder
he's a perfect partner

31:24.331 --> 31:30.128
While they were dancing
in that ballroom last night

31:30.231 --> 31:34.061
One more day for the wedding cake

31:34.164 --> 31:37.130
And 20 bottles of cola wine

31:37.265 --> 31:40.254
All the people
them dress up in the white

31:40.398 --> 31:42.990
<i>Because he don't stop at anything</i>

31:43.132 --> 31:47.792
<i>No wonder he's a perfect partner</i>

31:47.899 --> 31:52.991
<i>- While they were dancing
in that ballroom last night</i>

31:53.099 --> 31:56.997
<i>Auntie in her room cry</i>

31:57.099 --> 32:00.190

32:00.299 --> 32:02.891
<i>Papa's such a lovely fool in life</i>

32:03.000 --> 32:05.864
<i>He's never been to school

32:05.967 --> 32:11.059
<i>No wonder he's a perfect partner</i>

32:11.200 --> 32:17.031

32:26.034 --> 32:29.228

32:46.803 --> 32:49.201
<i>All the people

32:49.337 --> 32:52.235
Think that he don't stop
at anything...

32:52.337 --> 32:56.394
<i>Stop! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!
Put him on a separate track.</i>

32:56.504 --> 33:00.402
<i>- And what do you want?
- Bring the records for the rally, sir.</i>

33:03.837 --> 33:06.997
I can sing too, sir.
I'd like the chance to make a record.

33:07.104 --> 33:10.195
<i>Everybody want to make a record.
You almost ready there?</i>

33:10.304 --> 33:12.736
<i>But I have a boss song.
This one must sell.</i>

33:14.338 --> 33:16.998
- What time is the audition?
- Tomorrow.

33:17.139 --> 33:19.401
- Okay, let's go.
- What time tomorrow?

33:19.538 --> 33:22.663
- Tomorrow. We're ready.
- Okay, let's go. Roll again.

33:22.805 --> 33:26.169
<i>Tomorrow or next week.</i>

33:26.272 --> 33:29.238
<i>Auntie in her room cry</i>

33:29.339 --> 33:32.169
<i>Mama say she must wipe her eye</i>

33:55.474 --> 33:58.702
<i>Elsa?</i>

33:58.808 --> 34:00.933
<i>- Who that?
- Ivan.</i>

34:01.041 --> 34:03.064
<i>Come in.</i>

34:07.509 --> 34:10.964
- Fantastic news! Fantastic news!
- What happened?

34:11.074 --> 34:14.303
- You remember the man Hilton I was trying to see?
- Yeah.

34:14.408 --> 34:17.568
Saw him today.
He said I can record tomorrow.

34:17.675 --> 34:21.005
- Great!
- Well, I want you to help me out.

34:21.109 --> 34:24.632
- Yes.
- Will you lend me the key to go in the church?

34:24.775 --> 34:27.606
You must be mad.
You want Preacher kill me?

34:27.710 --> 34:31.108
Him don't have to know.
Can turn that amplifier down.

34:31.210 --> 34:33.835
- No, Ivan.
- Why not?

34:33.943 --> 34:38.205
- I just can't do it.
- If it wasn't for Preacher, I know you'd do it.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.708
That sort of music
can't play in church, Ivan.

34:40.811 --> 34:42.868
If Preacher catch me,
my life finished.

34:42.978 --> 34:45.909
Life finished with him,
but started with me.

34:46.011 --> 34:47.909
What do you mean?

34:48.011 --> 34:51.534
When this song hits, you know
what it mean for me and you?

34:51.645 --> 34:54.237
This is my big chance.

34:54.344 --> 34:57.402
This is what we waiting for
ever since I come to town.

34:57.545 --> 34:59.670
Nothing can stop me now,
you know?

34:59.812 --> 35:03.710
I don't have to worry no more.
We'll have this song hit for you and me.

35:03.812 --> 35:06.278
He won't let it, Ivan.

35:06.379 --> 35:09.573
You're not gonna live
in Preacher's house all your life.

35:09.679 --> 35:12.145
You're not gonna live with him
as man and wife.

35:12.246 --> 35:15.701
You're a big girl now.
You're not a child anymore.

35:15.813 --> 35:19.109
You have to make up your mind...

35:19.213 --> 35:22.145
between me and Preacher.

35:22.247 --> 35:25.179
Where's the song?

35:25.280 --> 35:27.542
I have the words
in my back pocket.

35:27.647 --> 35:30.136
Art outside.
Him listen to reason already.

35:38.381 --> 35:40.347
I'm trusting you, Ivan.

35:42.048 --> 35:43.946
All right.

35:48.149 --> 35:50.138
One, two...

35:50.349 --> 35:52.838
one, two, three, four.

36:02.782 --> 36:07.044
Tell me about pie up in the sky

36:07.183 --> 36:11.411
Waiting for me when I die

36:11.517 --> 36:14.677
Yes.

36:19.618 --> 36:24.710
And as sure as the sun
will shine up...

36:24.818 --> 36:27.909
What are you doing in my church
at this time of night?

36:28.018 --> 36:30.882
And playing all this kind
of music in my church!

36:30.985 --> 36:34.509
I will call the police to have you
arrested for breaking into my church!

36:34.619 --> 36:37.585
<i>- We had a key, you know, Preacher.
- A key?</i>

36:42.552 --> 36:45.450
- You gave him the key to my church?
- Yes.

36:45.553 --> 36:47.883
- Why?
- I had to give it to him.

36:47.952 --> 36:51.077
<i>- What else did you give to him?
- Nothing.</i>

36:53.087 --> 36:55.280
<i>- I gave him nothing!
- You're lying!</i>

36:55.386 --> 36:57.284
No!

36:57.387 --> 37:00.353
- You've been fornicating with him!
- No!

37:00.454 --> 37:03.784
<i>- You gave him your lips. You gave him your body.
- No, no!</i>

37:03.888 --> 37:07.548
<i>- Look at you!
- No! No!</i>

37:29.156 --> 37:33.384
Hi. I hear you resigned your post, man.
What are you doing here?

37:33.489 --> 37:36.580
- I come for my bicycle.
- Which bicycle?

37:36.689 --> 37:38.780
That same one.

37:38.890 --> 37:41.482
This bicycle is yours?

37:41.589 --> 37:44.680
Since when?
Where you buy it from?

37:44.789 --> 37:48.744
I didn't have to buy it. I see it
throwed in back. Nobody claim it.

37:48.891 --> 37:53.688
- This is Preacher's bicycle. Preacher's premises.
- Well, I fixed it up.

37:53.790 --> 37:58.813
Who told you to fix it? I'm grateful,
because Preacher give it to me.

37:58.924 --> 38:02.084
It took me three weeks
to fix the bicycle, Longa.

38:02.191 --> 38:04.316
I paid $6 for the wheels alone.

38:04.424 --> 38:06.822
That is your bad luck.

38:06.925 --> 38:11.221
Don't joke with your life, Longa.
Give me my bicycle.

38:11.325 --> 38:13.689
<i>If it is your bicycle,
take it, man.</i>

38:16.425 --> 38:18.618
Him cut me!

39:01.762 --> 39:04.320
You want dead?

39:04.428 --> 39:06.894
I will kill you.

39:06.996 --> 39:11.122
Don't... fuck... with... me.

39:15.363 --> 39:17.852
<i>You've had every chance to make good.</i>

39:17.963 --> 39:20.861
<i>You've been
taken into the church...</i>

39:20.963 --> 39:24.793
<i>and given a chance to lead
a good Christian life.</i>

39:24.930 --> 39:28.794
<i>And instead of that, you've gone
and filled your head...</i>

39:28.898 --> 39:32.228
<i>with foolishness and violence.</i>

39:32.330 --> 39:34.558
<i>Since this is
your first offense,</i>

39:34.664 --> 39:37.187
<i>I'm not going
to send you to jail.</i>

39:37.298 --> 39:40.389
<i>I'm going to give you a chance
to come to your senses.</i>

39:40.498 --> 39:43.521
<i>Either it will bring you
down to earth once and for all,</i>

39:43.632 --> 39:45.996
<i>or there's little hope for you.</i>

39:46.099 --> 39:48.691
<i>Eight strokes
of the tamarind switch.</i>

40:36.469 --> 40:40.265
Well, you tell me
about pie up in the sky

40:42.003 --> 40:45.026
Waiting for me when I die

40:46.502 --> 40:50.128
But between the day you're
born and when you die

40:52.003 --> 40:55.197
Never seem to hear even your cry

40:56.537 --> 41:00.765
<i>So as sure as the sun will shine</i>

41:00.870 --> 41:06.098
I'm gonna get my share, what's mine

41:06.237 --> 41:09.169
And then the harder they come

41:09.271 --> 41:13.033
The harder they'll fall
One and all

41:16.838 --> 41:19.202
<i>The harder they come</i>

41:19.305 --> 41:23.169
The harder they'll fall
One and all

41:26.338 --> 41:30.327
Well, the oppressors
are trying to keep me down

41:31.839 --> 41:34.805
Making me feel like a clown

41:36.273 --> 41:40.831
And they think that
they have got me on the run

41:40.973 --> 41:44.769
I say "Forgive them, Lord
they know not what they've done"

41:46.240 --> 41:50.434
'Cause as sure
as the sun will shine

41:50.541 --> 41:55.167
I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine

41:55.274 --> 41:58.707
And then the harder they come

41:58.807 --> 42:02.035
The harder they'll fall
One and all

42:06.475 --> 42:10.601
Harder they come
the harder they'll fall

42:10.708 --> 42:13.401
One and all

42:15.009 --> 42:16.907
Oh, yeah

42:35.243 --> 42:38.767
And they think that
they have got me on the run

42:40.610 --> 42:44.633
Tell them that they don't
It ain't no fun

42:44.777 --> 42:49.073
And I'd rather die
than live and be a slave

42:50.411 --> 42:54.468
Yes, I'd rather be
right in my grave

42:54.578 --> 42:58.908
So as sure as the sun will shine

42:59.012 --> 43:03.741
I'm gonna get my share right now
What's mine

43:03.845 --> 43:08.937
And then the harder they come
the harder they'll fall

43:09.046 --> 43:11.137
One and all

43:13.779 --> 43:18.677
Ooh, the harder they come
the harder they'll fall

43:18.813 --> 43:21.371
One and all

43:23.014 --> 43:26.276
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Harder they come

43:26.381 --> 43:30.211
The harder they'll fall
One and all

43:31.614 --> 43:33.705
What I say one time

43:41.148 --> 43:45.342
Sometime, sometime I feel
The harder, mmm

43:51.348 --> 43:54.974
One more time
One more time, yeah

44:01.016 --> 44:04.073
One more time now, uh

44:06.283 --> 44:08.909
All right, that's enough.

44:16.651 --> 44:18.844
That song all right.
I think we can use it.

44:18.951 --> 44:22.008
- When it going to be released, huh?
- Read this first.

44:28.151 --> 44:30.447
What's the meaning of this?

44:30.552 --> 44:33.313
That means you get
$20 for the record.

44:33.418 --> 44:36.578
Twenty dollars, sir?
That don't sound right.

44:36.685 --> 44:40.742
<i>- How much do you think it's worth, then?
- I don't really know, sir.</i>

44:40.852 --> 44:43.909
Come on, you must have an idea.
What do you think it's worth?

44:45.719 --> 44:48.685
Well, I think at least
about $200, you know, sir.

44:59.886 --> 45:02.818
I don't think I'm signing this
for $20, you know, sir.

45:02.921 --> 45:07.513
I see. Looks like
you have a new producer.

45:08.921 --> 45:11.319
I wish you luck.

45:17.022 --> 45:20.079
<i>- Numero Uno!
- Hi, brother. How are you doing?</i>

45:20.189 --> 45:23.121
Not bad, you know. I have this record
I'd like you to play for me.

45:23.222 --> 45:26.586
Let me have a look.
Hey, you're on a Hilton's label.

45:26.689 --> 45:30.712
No, well, I used his studio.
I like the sound.

45:30.822 --> 45:35.016
I see. But, well,
I deal directly Hilton's, man.

45:37.822 --> 45:40.754
But this is my personal
record, you know.

45:40.856 --> 45:45.448
This is personal.
I'm an independent producer as well.

45:45.557 --> 45:49.012
Well, like I said,
I deal with Hilton's direct.

45:49.124 --> 45:53.056
You know, this is show business, baby.
No business, no show.

45:56.957 --> 46:00.412
<i>The oppressors
are trying to keep me down</i>

46:00.524 --> 46:04.184
<i>Making me feel like a clown</i>

46:04.292 --> 46:08.054
<i>- No, man, you're joking.
What I gonna do with this?</i>

46:08.192 --> 46:10.784
After Hilton cut me off,
you gonna supply me?

46:10.925 --> 46:15.255
Hilton don't want this thing.
Take it back, son.

46:15.358 --> 46:19.018
Every day you say you're gonna sell the
record, but you can't without Hilton.

46:19.126 --> 46:21.319
We've waited long enough, man.
I want the money now.

46:21.426 --> 46:24.449
<i>I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine</i>

46:24.560 --> 46:29.788
<i>And then the harder they come
the harder they'll fall</i>

46:29.893 --> 46:32.359
<i>One and all</i>

46:38.594 --> 46:40.719
<i>- Mr. Hilton.
- What do you want now?</i>

46:40.860 --> 46:44.883
- To make another record?
- Not exactly, no, sir.

46:45.028 --> 46:47.517
<i>- What do you want, then?
- I want the money.</i>

46:47.627 --> 46:50.457
Which money? Which money?
Talk quick. Which money?

46:50.561 --> 46:53.288
You'll take the $20?

46:53.395 --> 46:56.088
Yes, I'll settle for that.

46:56.195 --> 46:58.423
You're damn right
you'll settle for that.

46:58.528 --> 47:01.494
I don't even particularly want
to do business with you anyway.

47:01.595 --> 47:04.857
<i>- What do you say your name is?
- Ivanhoe Martin.</i>

47:04.962 --> 47:06.860
Ivanhoe what?

47:06.962 --> 47:09.360
Martin.

47:09.462 --> 47:11.792
Here. Sign here.
And remember...

47:11.930 --> 47:14.590
next time you cut a record,
you see, sport,

47:14.729 --> 47:17.287
that I control this business.

47:17.429 --> 47:21.691
<i>Understand? Okay?
And remember something else.</i>

47:21.796 --> 47:26.286
I make hits, not the public.
I tell the DJs what to play.

47:26.397 --> 47:28.727
Understand?

47:28.830 --> 47:32.762
What do all of you want?
Ivanhoe no pay any of you yet?

47:32.864 --> 47:34.989
But Ivan's
supposed to pay you now.

47:35.097 --> 47:38.461
I not supposed to give you money.
Anyhow, come.

47:40.064 --> 47:42.292
And let this be
a lesson to you, see?

47:42.398 --> 47:44.796
Learn something
from this next time.

47:48.199 --> 47:51.563
Remember that fellow that wouldn't sign
the contract? You can release it.

47:51.666 --> 47:54.359
- Him sign now?
- Yep, but don't push it.

47:54.465 --> 47:57.363
Tell the DJs I just want
to make back my money, okay?

47:57.465 --> 48:00.158
- But, sir, it's a good record, you know.
- I know, I know.

48:00.266 --> 48:03.164
But he's a troublemaker.
I don't want anything to do with him.

48:03.266 --> 48:05.926
I don't want
to build him up, okay?

48:24.901 --> 48:27.231
- What happened, son?
- Trouble, sir.

48:27.334 --> 48:31.357
- What kind of trouble?
- Them shot Pedro's wife Nicole this evening.

48:31.468 --> 48:34.195
<i>- Who shot her?
- Army, sir.</i>

48:35.635 --> 48:38.124
- She had grass on her.
- Pedro got away with that.

48:39.936 --> 48:42.834
- All right, leave it to me.
- What I must tell the trader?

48:44.902 --> 48:47.528
They will just have to hold off
for a couple of days, Jose.

48:47.635 --> 48:50.760
- But the traders pay protection...
- Leave it to me.

48:50.869 --> 48:54.063
Traders pay protection money,
and one of them got shot.

48:54.203 --> 48:57.636
Tell them not to get frightened. Just cool
it for a couple of days and leave it to me.

48:57.770 --> 49:00.702
<i>- What about Pedro's wife?
- You organize that.</i>

49:00.803 --> 49:03.496
Find somebody to take her place,
all right? Check with me later.

49:03.604 --> 49:06.593
I have to go now, but you
check me at the police station.

49:06.704 --> 49:08.863
All right.

49:12.205 --> 49:16.467
Hello. Get me the commissioner of
police. Detective Ray Jones calling.

49:16.572 --> 49:19.902
Hello, Commissioner.
Yes, sir.

49:20.004 --> 49:23.402
The army went in today and shot
one of my people's women.

49:23.505 --> 49:26.835
<i>- They're doing a series of raids.
- I know, but nobody told me!</i>

49:26.972 --> 49:30.961
<i>- Who did they kill?
- An informer in the ganja trade.</i>

49:31.105 --> 49:34.367
They can't be concerned
with who is an informer.

49:34.472 --> 49:36.370
Well, I am concerned.

49:36.472 --> 49:38.461
How can I control
crime in my area...

49:38.573 --> 49:41.505
if the people giving me information
can't operate freely?

49:41.606 --> 49:45.198
Look, I know you use the trade
as a form of control,

49:45.307 --> 49:48.501
but I can't explain that
officially.

49:48.607 --> 49:51.903
All I can do is ask
the army to cooperate.

49:52.007 --> 49:56.939
Would you please explain that if anybody
controls what comes into town, it's me?

50:11.441 --> 50:15.806
Rupert, your mother dead.
She can't help you.

50:15.908 --> 50:18.272
Come. Come, let's go home.

50:32.843 --> 50:36.605
Hi, baby.
Get any work today?

50:40.144 --> 50:44.543
Big night tonight, you know.
Look what I buy you.

50:44.644 --> 50:47.906
<i>Ivan, you mean you take your money
and you buy that?</i>

50:48.010 --> 50:51.340
It's a mini. Sexy.

50:57.078 --> 51:01.272
Where's the food I asked you to buy?
You have any money left?

51:01.378 --> 51:03.810
Don't worry about money, man.
After my record...

51:03.912 --> 51:07.208
You sold out the record
to Hilton for $20.

51:07.345 --> 51:09.743
You don't have any more to get.

51:09.845 --> 51:12.811
Just wait until the other producers
hear my record tonight.

51:12.946 --> 51:15.912
We'll drive away
from this place tomorrow.

51:17.346 --> 51:21.074
- Give me $2 for tonight.
- Where I must get it from?

51:21.180 --> 51:23.271
You have it in your bosom, man.

51:23.379 --> 51:26.868
- I only have $2 left.
- That will do.

51:26.980 --> 51:30.969
I need it to buy food,
and I'm going to church tomorrow.

51:31.080 --> 51:35.308
Come with me.
You don't even have to dance.

51:35.414 --> 51:37.642
No. I'm tired.

51:37.781 --> 51:40.804
I've been walking and
looking for work all day.

51:40.948 --> 51:43.346
I'm not like you.

51:43.448 --> 51:47.574
Want me to go and beg work when
I have a record? I'm done with that.

51:47.682 --> 51:51.842
<i>I not done with it, though.
I was walking all day.</i>

51:51.949 --> 51:56.041
What are you walking for?
You don't believe I gonna make it.

51:56.149 --> 51:58.047
You think I'm just joking?

51:58.149 --> 52:01.707
All I'm telling you
is that I'm tired.

52:01.816 --> 52:05.646
You want me to go and beg work
for $ 10 a week for the rest of my life?

52:05.749 --> 52:08.874
I tried that.
I'd rather die.

52:08.983 --> 52:12.779
And I don't have to,
because I'm gonna make it.

52:12.916 --> 52:16.542
Ivan, you're a dreamer.

52:18.283 --> 52:21.807
Me? Dreamer?
Who's a bigger dreamer than you?

52:21.917 --> 52:24.906
Always talking about milk
and honey in the sky.

52:25.017 --> 52:28.108
Well, no milk and honey in the sky...
not for you, not for me.

52:28.218 --> 52:31.912
It's right down here,
and I want mine now, tonight!

52:32.018 --> 52:35.451
Can I just get out
of this place here?

52:39.185 --> 52:41.515
Sit tight and listen keenly...

52:41.619 --> 52:45.745
while I play for you a brand-new musical
biscuit from the Hilton's empire.

52:45.886 --> 52:51.581
This is a brand-new song they call "The
Harder They Fall" by the man called Ivan.

53:02.253 --> 53:07.447
<i>Well, you tell me
about pie up in the sky</i>

53:07.554 --> 53:11.987
<i>Waiting for me when I die</i>

53:12.087 --> 53:16.520
<i>But between the day
you're born and when you die</i>

53:16.621 --> 53:21.077
<i>Never seem to hear even your cry</i>

53:21.188 --> 53:24.450
<i>- So as sure as the sun
- What do you think of this song?</i>

53:24.555 --> 53:27.044
<i>- Will shine
- Not bad.</i>

53:27.188 --> 53:31.678
<i>I'm gonna get my share, what's mine
- I think it's a hit.</i>

53:31.789 --> 53:35.551
<i>- And then the harder they come
- I said all right.</i>

53:35.655 --> 53:39.053
<i>The harder they'll fall
One and all</i>

53:42.656 --> 53:47.248
<i>The harder they come
the harder they'll fall</i>

53:47.356 --> 53:49.788
<i>One and all</i>

53:52.457 --> 53:56.856
<i>Well, the oppressors
are trying to keep me down</i>

53:56.958 --> 54:00.220
<i>Making me feel like a clown</i>

54:02.158 --> 54:06.147
<i>And they think that
they have got me on the run</i>

54:06.258 --> 54:11.384
<i>I say "Forgive them, Lord
they know not what they've done"</i>

54:11.491 --> 54:16.254
<i>'Cause as sure as the sun will shine</i>

54:16.358 --> 54:21.757
<i>I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine</i>

54:21.858 --> 54:26.950
<i>And then the harder they come
the harder they'll fall</i>

54:27.092 --> 54:29.024
<i>One and all</i>

54:32.327 --> 54:36.419
<i>Harder they come
the harder they'll fall</i>

54:36.527 --> 54:38.857
<i>One and all</i>

54:40.293 --> 54:43.418
<i>Sometime, sometime I feel</i>

54:43.527 --> 54:45.925
<i>The harder, mmm</i>

54:51.361 --> 54:53.486
<i>One more time, one more time</i>

54:56.595 --> 54:58.720
<i>What's happening, Jose?</i>

54:58.861 --> 55:01.827
<i>- Hey, wild man.
- My song got just play, you know.</i>

55:01.928 --> 55:04.326
- Wait! You lie!
- My song!

55:04.429 --> 55:07.520
- Serious? You move up!
- Movin' up, yes.

55:07.629 --> 55:10.289
<i>You didn't come here
to dance tonight.</i>

55:13.295 --> 55:16.284
- I used to show him around the town. Is lie?
- True. True.

55:16.396 --> 55:19.829
- Where that beer? What are you drinking?
- Baby Cham.

55:19.929 --> 55:23.054
- One Baby Cham for my girl.
- What's happening?

55:23.163 --> 55:25.721
- Oh, what's up?
- What's happening?

55:25.830 --> 55:28.728
My singer friend is paying
for the drinks. What are you drinking?

55:28.830 --> 55:33.819
- I drink a stout.
- Beer and stout.

55:33.964 --> 55:36.624
- Where you going?
- Don't worry, man. I'll soon come back.

55:36.764 --> 55:39.753
All right. Beer and stout
for my friend, then.

55:39.898 --> 55:43.092
Here me now. You control
till I come back, all right?

55:43.198 --> 55:46.426
All right.
Where's my order?

56:04.566 --> 56:07.192
- What happened?
- What's the big joke?

56:07.333 --> 56:11.288
- What's the big worry?
- Well, I tried to tell you I have to collect some money.

56:11.433 --> 56:14.831
- All right. Come. I'll give you a ride.
- No, that's all right.

56:14.933 --> 56:17.728
Boy, I like how you slid
out of the bar a while ago.

56:17.833 --> 56:19.890
Since you come town,
you learn a lot.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.330
- But don't try to fool me.
- What do you mean?

56:22.434 --> 56:25.332
Tell me something.
Where did you make that record?

56:25.434 --> 56:29.128
- Hilton.
- I bet you only got $20 for that record.

56:30.767 --> 56:34.165
- Well...
- Don't try to tell me no lie. I know the scene.

56:34.268 --> 56:37.496
I know that it even reach number one,
you not gonna get cent.

56:37.602 --> 56:40.534
- How you know that?
- It's all right. Tell me something.

56:40.635 --> 56:43.658
- Do you think you can handle big money?
- Yes.

56:43.802 --> 56:47.132
- I think I can work out something for you.
- Like what?

56:47.236 --> 56:49.395
I think I can work out
something for you.

56:49.502 --> 56:51.400
- All right.
- Come with me.

56:51.836 --> 56:55.291
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

56:55.502 --> 56:58.957
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

56:59.070 --> 57:01.934
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

57:02.036 --> 57:04.002
<i>But you must try</i>

57:04.103 --> 57:07.831
<i>Try and try, try and try</i>

57:07.937 --> 57:10.903
<i>You'll succeed at last</i>

57:12.238 --> 57:14.999
Where you going?
Police up ahead there.

57:15.137 --> 57:17.365
It's all right, man.
Don't worry yourself.

57:17.471 --> 57:22.063
- What happen if they stop us?
- You ask too much questions. Just enjoy the ride.

57:22.171 --> 57:24.069
Wave.

57:25.838 --> 57:28.963
<i>Got your mind set on a dream</i>

57:29.072 --> 57:32.232
<i>- Honey, you feed the chickens
for me this morning?</i>

57:32.339 --> 57:34.532
- Yes.
- Good.

57:34.639 --> 57:38.435
Don't go too near the fire draft.
You might get sick again.

57:43.139 --> 57:45.765
Your daddy coming, honey.

57:45.906 --> 57:49.929
<i>- Try and try, try and try
- Rupert.</i>

57:50.074 --> 57:53.507
<i>You'll succeed at last</i>

57:53.607 --> 57:55.505
<i>I know it</i>

57:55.607 --> 57:58.835
- You didn't give Miss Elsa trouble today?
- No.

57:58.940 --> 58:02.872
You take your medicine? All right,
here a sweet for your medicine.

58:02.975 --> 58:05.770
- Go get the cutting knife.
- You bring something for me, Ivan?

58:05.874 --> 58:09.432
- This is for Pedro.
- You not catch any fish today?

58:09.541 --> 58:11.564
No, sea rough.

58:13.874 --> 58:16.635
- You have a good girl, you know?
- Yes.

58:16.742 --> 58:19.936
Since Rupert's mother dead,
she take care of him for me.

58:20.076 --> 58:23.167
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

58:23.309 --> 58:27.037
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

58:27.142 --> 58:29.835
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

58:29.942 --> 58:32.135
<i>But you must try</i>

58:32.243 --> 58:34.766
<i>Go to the bar with this.</i>

58:34.876 --> 58:37.933
Tell them we'll send the rest later
and collect tonight.

58:51.178 --> 58:54.338
- Stout for me.
- Stout and no beer?

58:54.478 --> 58:57.444
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

58:57.578 --> 59:00.703
- How'd it go this week?
- Not too bad, Pedro.

59:00.812 --> 59:04.040
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

59:04.145 --> 59:07.111
<i>But you must try</i>

59:13.546 --> 59:16.706
- We'll split that.
- Who that for?

59:16.813 --> 59:19.836
Jose don't tell you all this thing?

59:19.946 --> 59:22.139
- About what?
- About this.

59:22.247 --> 59:25.270
- No.
- This half for Jose.

59:25.413 --> 59:27.470
What for?

59:27.614 --> 59:31.274
You think I sell this thing?

59:31.413 --> 59:33.743
So what happens?
Jose collects from everybody?

59:33.847 --> 59:36.370
Everybody who make
more than one trip.

59:41.914 --> 59:44.403
Then how come Jose not rich?

59:44.514 --> 59:47.844
- This not stay with Jose, you know.
- Who it go to?

59:47.948 --> 59:51.472
You ask too much question, man.
We get you.

59:51.581 --> 59:53.740
- Well, so far.
- All right. All right.

59:53.848 --> 59:56.780
The most you have to do
is give Jose $ 15 a week.

59:56.881 --> 59:58.904
Everything all right, right?

59:59.048 --> 01:00:01.514
Hey, what happening, Pedro?

01:00:01.649 --> 01:00:04.581
- Can I drag? All right.
- Mmm.

01:00:13.383 --> 01:00:17.247
What happening, Pedro?

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:23.048
Love.

01:00:24.451 --> 01:00:27.576
Give me a light.

01:00:54.586 --> 01:00:56.882
New to this, man?

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:59.146
In a form.

01:00:59.253 --> 01:01:01.276
You need some protection?

01:01:01.386 --> 01:01:06.012
- Like what?
- Like... a gun.

01:01:06.153 --> 01:01:07.551
What?

01:01:12.587 --> 01:01:14.485
How much for this?

01:01:14.587 --> 01:01:16.883
$20 for the pair, man.

01:01:16.988 --> 01:01:20.250
- I'm not sure if this work.
- Yes, man. It work, man.

01:01:20.355 --> 01:01:22.253
It work good, man.

01:01:25.488 --> 01:01:28.579
- It's expensive, man.
- No, man. Cheap all your life.

01:01:34.322 --> 01:01:37.311
Do you think I should take them
as a matching pair or no?

01:01:37.422 --> 01:01:40.684
What do you want to do with it?
You out to kill somebody?

01:01:40.823 --> 01:01:44.983
<i>- No, I don't plan killing anybody.
- Then leave it, man. Leave it.</i>

01:02:36.893 --> 01:02:40.553
<i>You can tell by the way you look</i>

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.286
<i>Your face, your hands, your hair.</i>

01:02:43.393 --> 01:02:46.325
<i>Everywhere
as beautiful as can be.</i>

01:02:46.461 --> 01:02:48.450
<i>You can tell</i>

01:02:48.594 --> 01:02:50.492
<i>It's Chantel</i>

01:02:50.594 --> 01:02:54.890
<i>Chantel olive oil pomade... the one that's
rich with lanolin and pure olive oil...</i>

01:02:54.995 --> 01:02:57.790
<i>to make your hair soft,
smooth and easy to manage.</i>

01:02:57.894 --> 01:03:01.383
<i>- Serve them right.
- Who?</i>

01:03:01.495 --> 01:03:05.087
They say they hold a plane
in Florida loaded with ganja.

01:03:05.195 --> 01:03:07.787
They say it come from here too.

01:03:07.895 --> 01:03:09.793
Let's see.

01:03:13.595 --> 01:03:16.527
$ 100,000.

01:03:21.563 --> 01:03:26.962
One good thing. They say the U.S. Government
will aid the army to clamp down on them.

01:03:27.063 --> 01:03:29.461
Where's Pedro?

01:03:29.563 --> 01:03:32.757
- I don't know.
- All right. I'll soon come.

01:03:38.397 --> 01:03:41.295
Jose, you read the newspaper?

01:03:41.397 --> 01:03:43.955
Mm-hmm. Your play.

01:03:47.798 --> 01:03:50.128
Them catch a plane.

01:03:50.231 --> 01:03:52.129
Two get through.

01:03:54.398 --> 01:03:56.864
Somebody makin' plenty money.

01:03:56.965 --> 01:03:58.863
Not us.

01:03:58.965 --> 01:04:00.863
I only gettin' spit.

01:04:04.666 --> 01:04:07.530
Who makin' all the money?

01:04:07.633 --> 01:04:11.963
Ask no questions, tell no lies.

01:04:12.066 --> 01:04:13.964
Serious.

01:04:14.066 --> 01:04:17.157
We could sell some direct,
you and I.

01:04:19.033 --> 01:04:20.931
Your play.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.133
They sellin' the thing for export.
At least we should get a little extra.

01:04:28.268 --> 01:04:31.098
I is the one takin' the risk.
You know that.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.360
What, you wanna split?

01:04:33.468 --> 01:04:36.366
No, I don't wanna split.
I just want more money.

01:04:36.468 --> 01:04:40.400
You're lucky you're makin' a living.
When I know you, down by your ass.

01:04:40.501 --> 01:04:42.967
Now you have a Honda parked outside.

01:04:43.068 --> 01:04:46.557
I don't like what's going on.

01:04:46.669 --> 01:04:52.125
Listen. Better finish
that game, now. Come, Pinky.

01:05:17.971 --> 01:05:21.903
That is all we're getting this week? After
we pay Jose, we don't have anything left.

01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:24.631
What do you want? I don't even pay
the doctor on Wednesday.

01:05:24.771 --> 01:05:28.897
Don't pay Jose this week. Let him take our
share from the money they make in America.

01:05:29.038 --> 01:05:31.731
But I have to go explain
the position to Jose.

01:05:31.839 --> 01:05:34.703
And it's they caused the army
to burn the field down.

01:05:34.805 --> 01:05:36.703
Come here, sir.

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:45.571
Love, man.

01:05:48.306 --> 01:05:53.035
Jose, can't pay all this week.
My baby's sick, you know.

01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:57.470
No, that's not my concern.
Just $ 15 I need.

01:05:57.607 --> 01:06:00.096
- My wife. She get me this week.
- I need just $ 15.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.729
I don't want no soft words.
Just $ 15.

01:06:03.874 --> 01:06:06.466
- Just money I give you.
- Money. That's right.

01:06:06.574 --> 01:06:08.472
Love, man.

01:06:10.375 --> 01:06:13.035
I pay you $5 this week, Jose.

01:06:14.842 --> 01:06:18.536
- Keep that till you come out.
- Come out from where?

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:20.665
Pedro, tell him, huh?

01:06:20.775 --> 01:06:23.298
I'm not afraid of you,
you know, Jose.

01:06:23.409 --> 01:06:26.739
You think it's me
you must be afraid of?

01:06:35.277 --> 01:06:37.539
Hello, Mr. Ray. Yes, sir.

01:06:37.643 --> 01:06:42.008
<i>The guy I get to help Pedro.
Him giving me a lot of trouble.</i>

01:06:42.110 --> 01:06:44.905
<i>We have to lock him up for a while
and teach him a lesson.</i>

01:07:22.647 --> 01:07:25.205
Tell me something.

01:07:25.313 --> 01:07:27.871
Haven't I seen you
with Jose somewhere before?

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:30.378
Which Jose that?

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.344
The same one that send the police
after me, and I shoot him off the bike.

01:07:34.447 --> 01:07:36.936
You're a bad man.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:41.137
- Yeah.
- I see what you mean.

01:07:45.948 --> 01:07:50.506
<i>Hey. Hold up a little, man.</i>

01:07:50.614 --> 01:07:52.773
<i>Hey, ease up, man.</i>

01:08:13.050 --> 01:08:14.948
Stay there.

01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:22.113
What happened, eh?
What happened?

01:08:57.053 --> 01:09:00.383
<i>All right! See you later.</i>

01:09:14.154 --> 01:09:16.779
Wait. What happened, sir?

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.283
Oh, you have gun.
And you have on no pants.

01:09:20.388 --> 01:09:23.684
You're stupid, huh?

01:09:23.787 --> 01:09:25.685
<i>You can get 0-5, 0-6.</i>

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:29.618
<i>- I want every possible car in the area.
- All right.</i>

01:09:38.055 --> 01:09:40.487
Lend me a pen and a paper.

01:09:42.555 --> 01:09:46.578
Hey, look what a fella
just brought in.

01:09:48.555 --> 01:09:54.080
"I have made a record of crime
history"? Do you think the guy's serious?

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:56.314
He's serious enough
to kill three of my men.

01:09:56.456 --> 01:09:59.048
You're jokin'.
Three men?

01:09:59.157 --> 01:10:03.852
Well, I know because the man
was in my office three minutes ago.

01:10:03.957 --> 01:10:05.855
Yeah.

01:10:05.958 --> 01:10:09.356
<i>What you doing
down there so long? You thinking?</i>

01:10:09.457 --> 01:10:13.446
<i>You mean you can't think
of a story to fool me with tonight?</i>

01:10:13.557 --> 01:10:16.523
<i>You go on,
make up your story, man.</i>

01:10:16.625 --> 01:10:21.285
<i>What a day when I catch you out,
and no story can help you.</i>

01:10:21.392 --> 01:10:25.347
<i>That is the day I'm waiting for.</i>

01:10:32.293 --> 01:10:36.419
Hurry, give me a gun, sir.
I must find him in my area.

01:10:36.526 --> 01:10:39.390
- Elsa?
- Ivan, what happened?

01:10:39.493 --> 01:10:43.789
- You hear anything on the radio?
- The policeman outside said they're looking for you.

01:10:43.893 --> 01:10:48.519
- Where's the radio?
- What happened? He say you shoot a policeman.

01:10:48.627 --> 01:10:52.753
- You think it's one I drop?
I killed three.

01:10:52.861 --> 01:10:56.623
- God forgive you.
- There's nothing on the radio except music.

01:10:56.727 --> 01:11:00.182
You'll see a news flash
about me later.

01:11:00.295 --> 01:11:03.853
<i>Where are you going now?
Where are you going to hide?</i>

01:11:03.994 --> 01:11:07.119
Hide? I not hidin'.

01:11:07.228 --> 01:11:09.955
<i>But everybody
will be looking for you.</i>

01:11:10.062 --> 01:11:12.857
You didn't believe me?

01:11:12.962 --> 01:11:15.394
Didn't I tell you I was
going to be famous one day?

01:11:15.496 --> 01:11:18.656
- You're mad.
- Tell Pedro to meet me tonight.

01:11:18.763 --> 01:11:20.661
He will know where.

01:11:22.529 --> 01:11:25.620
Tell him to bring money
and some more bullets.

01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:28.161
Tell him I want to find Jose.

01:11:28.263 --> 01:11:30.491
What you want to see Jose for?

01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:33.096
Read about that tomorrow.

01:11:34.697 --> 01:11:37.857
<i>Oh, it's you.</i>

01:11:39.597 --> 01:11:42.586
- Where's Jose?
- What you want him for?

01:11:42.697 --> 01:11:44.925
I have something for him.

01:11:45.031 --> 01:11:47.327
Give it to me.
I will give it to him.

01:11:47.431 --> 01:11:50.795
So you want to give it to him?

01:11:51.931 --> 01:11:54.523
I have somethin'
for you too, you know.

01:11:54.631 --> 01:11:59.962
Me God. Look what
me get myself into now.

01:12:00.065 --> 01:12:02.758
I'll tell you who's crying to me
in bed, double-crossing me.

01:12:02.866 --> 01:12:05.593
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ!

01:12:05.732 --> 01:12:07.823
Jesus Christ! Mercy!

01:12:07.966 --> 01:12:11.160
No! No! No!
Don't shoot!

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:17.625
<i>Killed a motorcycle policeman
three days ago.</i>

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:19.892
<i>Last night,
after escaping police,</i>

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.989
<i>the wanted man held up a pedestrian
and took away his clothes.</i>

01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:25.293
<i>Early this morning, he went
to the house ofJose Smith,</i>

01:12:25.401 --> 01:12:27.867
<i>whom he suspected
of informing on him.</i>

01:12:27.967 --> 01:12:32.161
<i>Not finding Smith, he shot and wounded
a woman whom he found in Smith's room.</i>

01:12:32.267 --> 01:12:35.631
<i>Police sources have identified her as the
same woman who was with the fugitive...</i>

01:12:35.734 --> 01:12:38.700
<i>in the hotel room when
the police tried to apprehend him.</i>

01:12:38.801 --> 01:12:40.892
<i>This Ras boy. When him come?</i>

01:12:41.035 --> 01:12:44.433
<i>Give bike, give money
give place to live.</i>

01:12:44.535 --> 01:12:48.490
<i>But when him come today,
get him dead. Get him dead.</i>

01:12:48.602 --> 01:12:52.000
<i>Shoot him in the heart.
Kill him.</i>

01:12:52.102 --> 01:12:54.159
<i>Me conquer this place
upon birth.</i>

01:13:08.836 --> 01:13:10.734
<i>Yeah</i>

01:13:15.137 --> 01:13:17.967
<i>Yeah</i>

01:13:18.071 --> 01:13:20.503
<i>Jose, you lookin'for me?</i>

01:13:20.604 --> 01:13:22.399
I come to shoot you...

01:13:23.505 --> 01:13:25.664
<i>Pressure drop, oh, pressure</i>

01:13:25.772 --> 01:13:28.829
<i>Oh, yeah, pressure
put the drop on you</i>

01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:31.904
<i>I said pressure drop
Oh, pressure</i>

01:13:32.005 --> 01:13:35.460
<i>Oh, yeah
Pressure put the drop on you</i>

01:13:35.571 --> 01:13:39.526
<i>I say you really dropped
Oh, you gotta believe it</i>

01:13:39.639 --> 01:13:42.003
<i>Oh, what you are doing is wrong</i>

01:13:42.105 --> 01:13:46.094
<i>I say you really dropped
Oh, you gotta believe it</i>

01:13:46.239 --> 01:13:49.637
<i>Oh, what you are doing is wrong</i>

01:13:52.773 --> 01:13:55.331
<i>Yeah</i>

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.838
All right.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:10.429
You run, but I'll find you.
I'll find you, you hear?

01:14:10.541 --> 01:14:14.030
<i>You know where you fucking live!</i>

01:14:14.141 --> 01:14:16.936
<i>I'm gonna find you.
I'm gonna find you anyway.</i>

01:14:17.075 --> 01:14:21.531
<i>Oh, yeah
Pressure put the drop on you</i>

01:14:25.742 --> 01:14:27.640
Anybody see Jose?

01:14:27.742 --> 01:14:32.505
- Must have gone underground.
- Must be lookin' police protection.

01:14:32.609 --> 01:14:36.201
- Him not comin' for money this week.
- For what? Ivan fixed that.

01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:41.470
- Something else happened now.
- Whatever happened, the guy Ivan is our boss.

01:14:41.576 --> 01:14:44.508
Hey, sis, you have any tune
over there in the jukebox?

01:14:46.277 --> 01:14:49.641
<i>- You find the record yet, man?
- Well, it was put back here a long time ago.</i>

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:53.301
Find the record.
Find it.

01:14:53.444 --> 01:14:58.104
<i>El Numero Uno socks the sound
of blood and soul!</i>

01:14:58.210 --> 01:15:01.574
Hey, good evening everybody.
Welcome to the Big T show,

01:15:01.678 --> 01:15:04.439
back in my home where
the sweet soul sisters roam.

01:15:04.545 --> 01:15:07.773
My mojo workin', and my soul
sort of cookin' and snookin'.

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:10.605
Like they say, the "T" thing
goes for four hours long,

01:15:10.712 --> 01:15:13.076
- and it's the sound of soul
and big boss country here.

01:15:13.179 --> 01:15:16.668
I hear my ring-a-ling.
Let's see what's happening.

01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:19.540
Hi. Hello. Good evening,
chicaboo. How are you?

01:15:19.646 --> 01:15:22.078
You wanna hear that song again?
You know something?

01:15:22.179 --> 01:15:24.668
All the other jocks been gettin'
this call all day...

01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:27.269
for this big bad song
about the runaway guy.

01:15:27.413 --> 01:15:30.868
I wonder what he's doing now. I think
he's gettin' his thing together too.

01:15:31.013 --> 01:15:34.104
We'll play it for you.
That's the same one I had for you.

01:15:34.213 --> 01:15:36.441
So here we go.
We're gonna do it for you right now.

01:15:36.547 --> 01:15:40.639
- That guy is sort of turning
the nation over, getting everybody...

01:15:40.747 --> 01:15:43.043
Wow. I got it for you here.

01:15:43.148 --> 01:15:46.978
- So it goes something like this.
Dig it, huh?

01:15:49.181 --> 01:15:52.045
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:15:52.148 --> 01:15:54.137
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:15:54.248 --> 01:15:58.738
<i>Well, they tell me of a pie
up in the sky</i>

01:15:58.882 --> 01:16:03.611
<i>Waiting for me when I die</i>

01:16:03.715 --> 01:16:08.171
<i>But between the day
you're born and when you die</i>

01:16:08.282 --> 01:16:12.942
<i>They never seem to hear
even your cry</i>

01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:18.210
<i>So as sure as the sun will shine</i>

01:16:18.317 --> 01:16:22.647
<i>I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine</i>

01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:27.876
<i>And then the harder they come
the harder they'll fall</i>

01:16:27.984 --> 01:16:30.973
<i>One and all</i>

01:16:32.284 --> 01:16:35.148
<i>Ooh, the harder they come</i>

01:16:35.251 --> 01:16:39.581
<i>The harder they'll fall
One and all</i>

01:16:42.518 --> 01:16:44.507
I can't make this record die again.

01:16:44.618 --> 01:16:47.607
<i>The oppressors
are trying to keep me down</i>

01:16:47.719 --> 01:16:50.947
Yes, I can usually do it, man,
but it's gone too far now.

01:16:51.052 --> 01:16:54.576
<i>It's on the charts.</i>

01:16:54.686 --> 01:16:57.084
You know I always cooperate
with the police, man,

01:16:57.186 --> 01:16:59.516
but this time...

01:16:59.619 --> 01:17:01.676
I know how you feel,
but I wanna catch him myself.

01:17:01.786 --> 01:17:04.809
Do me a favor.
You tell me when you catch him,

01:17:04.952 --> 01:17:08.385
so I can get him to make another record
for me before you string him up.

01:18:00.724 --> 01:18:04.850
Hey, what are you doing
in the man's car?

01:18:05.957 --> 01:18:08.185
- You can drive?
- Yes.

01:18:08.291 --> 01:18:10.189
Drive.

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:58.786
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

01:18:58.895 --> 01:19:02.623
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

01:19:02.728 --> 01:19:05.194
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

01:19:05.295 --> 01:19:07.261
<i>But you must try</i>

01:19:07.362 --> 01:19:09.260
<i>Try and try</i>

01:19:09.362 --> 01:19:11.487
<i>Try and try</i>

01:19:11.629 --> 01:19:14.618
<i>You'll succeed at last</i>

01:19:16.662 --> 01:19:20.890
<i>Mmm-hmm-mmm, oh, yeah</i>

01:19:20.996 --> 01:19:25.486
<i>Persecution you must bear</i>

01:19:25.596 --> 01:19:28.926
<i>Win or lose
You got to get your share</i>

01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:32.860
<i>Got your mind set on a dream</i>

01:19:32.963 --> 01:19:36.327
<i>You can get it
though hard it may seem now</i>

01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:40.192
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

01:19:40.297 --> 01:19:43.923
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

01:19:44.064 --> 01:19:46.053
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:48.096
<i>But you must try</i>

01:20:16.866 --> 01:20:20.458
Sidney, how much time I lock you up?
Three times.

01:20:20.666 --> 01:20:22.723
Yes, sir.

01:20:22.866 --> 01:20:27.526
How much time I let you off?
Plenty times.

01:20:27.667 --> 01:20:29.758
<i>Plenty times.</i>

01:20:29.901 --> 01:20:33.026
You remember the number of times
you find yourself up in my yard...

01:20:33.134 --> 01:20:35.760
when you go down to the police station,
when you need help?

01:20:35.867 --> 01:20:38.799
<i>- Yes, sir.
- You remember the number of times I help you?</i>

01:20:38.901 --> 01:20:41.094
<i>- Hey?
- Yes, sir.</i>

01:20:41.201 --> 01:20:44.292
How come you know I lookin'
for Ivan for the last two weeks,

01:20:44.401 --> 01:20:46.833
and you hidin' Ivan in
your swamps and don't tell me?

01:20:46.935 --> 01:20:52.266
<i>Since when another dirty criminal
like yourself mean more to you than me?</i>

01:20:52.369 --> 01:20:55.267
You believe him can help you
more than me? Hey?

01:20:55.369 --> 01:20:58.824
<i>- Answer me. You believe him can help you more than me?
- No, sir.</i>

01:20:58.936 --> 01:21:01.528
Then why the backside you hidin'
him for? What is going on?

01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:03.658
<i>You think him smarter than me...</i>

01:21:03.803 --> 01:21:07.633
<i>because him have a hundred places
to hide, and I can't find him?</i>

01:21:07.736 --> 01:21:10.429
It's not because him smart
I can't find him.

01:21:10.537 --> 01:21:12.628
It's because
you're all foolish...

01:21:12.737 --> 01:21:17.397
and all believe because I so busy
chasin' Ivan now I forget about you.

01:21:17.503 --> 01:21:21.868
But I stop chase Ivan now.
I gonna start chase you.

01:21:21.970 --> 01:21:26.630
<i>All of you, and as of this week no more
ganja come into this town, you hear me?</i>

01:21:26.738 --> 01:21:30.034
Not a stick, not a spliff,
not even a puff.

01:21:31.471 --> 01:21:33.369
<i>I'm going to starve you.</i>

01:21:34.771 --> 01:21:38.135
Let me see how much you love
Ivan when your belly empty.

01:22:09.574 --> 01:22:12.063
<i>Take one more.</i>

01:22:12.207 --> 01:22:14.105
Film finish.

01:22:15.908 --> 01:22:18.500
- When I can get them?
- About tomorrow evening.

01:22:18.608 --> 01:22:21.131
- Now.
- But it will take me at least...

01:22:21.241 --> 01:22:23.366
Now.

01:22:23.475 --> 01:22:26.067
All right.
Come this way.

01:22:28.475 --> 01:22:31.600
- Last one, that?
- Yes.

01:22:31.709 --> 01:22:33.971
<i>Fitz.</i>

01:22:34.076 --> 01:22:36.634
<i>- He's busy.
- Okay. I'll wait.</i>

01:22:46.943 --> 01:22:49.239
By the way,
they catch the wild guy yet?

01:22:49.344 --> 01:22:52.504
<i>I don't hear any news about him,
but I don't want 'em catch him.</i>

01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:55.576
I like the excitement.
The boy is great!

01:22:55.677 --> 01:22:57.609
All right.
You can come in.

01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:05.237
Fitz, why so quiet?

01:23:05.345 --> 01:23:08.277
- Backside!
- Come. So.

01:23:13.012 --> 01:23:14.910
<i>- Fitz, you have a pen?
- Hey.</i>

01:23:15.012 --> 01:23:17.604
<i>- What you want a pen for?
- Autograph, man. Autograph.</i>

01:23:17.712 --> 01:23:20.076
<i>- Right here.
- Don't you have one to spare?</i>

01:23:28.347 --> 01:23:31.074
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:33.078
Rest.

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:35.078
<i>This is the last one, sir.</i>

01:23:38.114 --> 01:23:41.842
Send this one to the editor.
Make sure him get it.

01:23:41.947 --> 01:23:43.845
<i>All right.</i>

01:23:44.481 --> 01:23:46.379
Backside.

01:23:48.548 --> 01:23:52.605
But you can't expect me not
to publish a picture like this.

01:23:52.715 --> 01:23:56.375
But this is a fantastic picture.
You don't want to see it?

01:24:02.048 --> 01:24:05.537
- I see you banned the record.
- Yes.

01:24:05.649 --> 01:24:09.377
- And you never had the courtesy to tell me.
- I don't understand you, Hilton.

01:24:09.482 --> 01:24:13.006
I called you and asked you
for your help. I called you once.

01:24:13.116 --> 01:24:17.446
Am I to understand now that the police is out
telling people what they must listen to?

01:24:17.583 --> 01:24:20.413
Yes, if it glorifies crime.

01:24:20.516 --> 01:24:23.914
So the record get the people
all excited about this guy.

01:24:24.017 --> 01:24:25.915
He's a criminal
they're gonna catch anyhow.

01:24:26.017 --> 01:24:27.915
<i>It's no big deal.</i>

01:24:28.017 --> 01:24:31.108
<i>What I don't understand is when you
start fooling with the hit parade.</i>

01:24:31.217 --> 01:24:34.274
When you fool around with that
then they know something is wrong.

01:24:34.384 --> 01:24:38.612
<i>- That's when you make the guy into a big deal.
- I can't stop now.</i>

01:24:38.718 --> 01:24:41.513
I wanna talk to you.
I hear you stopped the ganja trade too.

01:24:41.617 --> 01:24:44.981
<i>- Yes, but I didn't know that interested you.
- Naturally.</i>

01:24:45.085 --> 01:24:47.074
This is the only thing
that brings money to this area.

01:24:47.185 --> 01:24:49.583
<i>You know something?</i>

01:24:49.719 --> 01:24:51.742
No hit parade, no ganja.

01:24:51.885 --> 01:24:54.749
Hmm, you better catch him fast.

01:24:54.852 --> 01:24:59.148
Once these jokers get hungry enough to start
tradin' without you, then you're finished.

01:24:59.252 --> 01:25:03.309
And then law and order finish in this entire
area. You understand that, don't you?

01:25:05.653 --> 01:25:07.551
I going.

01:26:04.690 --> 01:26:07.520
See the man there.
Shoot! Fire!

01:26:22.925 --> 01:26:25.448
<i>Why you not warn me they was coming?</i>

01:26:44.727 --> 01:26:46.659
What happened, Elsa?
How him feeling?

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.226
Fever gone.

01:26:49.327 --> 01:26:51.316
I thank God.

01:26:51.427 --> 01:26:54.416
If we don't have to give more blood,
everything will be all right.

01:26:54.527 --> 01:26:57.459
The doctor says
he must have good food.

01:27:00.294 --> 01:27:02.987
Why is the police raging?

01:27:04.828 --> 01:27:08.352
Till last night, them lock up Duffus
and Midnight Cowboy.

01:27:08.495 --> 01:27:10.961
As you know,
the bike sell already.

01:27:12.095 --> 01:27:14.186
What about the fishing?

01:27:15.628 --> 01:27:17.821
To tell you the truth, you know,

01:27:17.929 --> 01:27:20.986
that boat, it sell a long,
long time ago, you know.

01:27:21.096 --> 01:27:23.654
Even when Ivan was here,
you never had it?

01:27:23.762 --> 01:27:25.660
No.

01:27:32.896 --> 01:27:34.987
You hear from Ivan?

01:27:35.097 --> 01:27:36.995
No.

01:27:39.263 --> 01:27:41.286
I wonder how his shoulder
getting on.

01:27:44.731 --> 01:27:46.993
- What time Jose coming?
- Soon come.

01:27:47.098 --> 01:27:49.223
What I tell him, sir?

01:27:49.331 --> 01:27:51.820
Dollar fifty not bad.

01:27:51.931 --> 01:27:54.795
Resume.
What we waiting for?

01:27:54.897 --> 01:27:58.954
Can't resume just like that.
They want something more.

01:27:59.065 --> 01:28:01.623
They won't resume
until they get Ivan.

01:28:01.732 --> 01:28:03.255
Anybody see him?

01:28:03.366 --> 01:28:07.492
<i>- No.
- My belly empty. My baby belly empty too.</i>

01:28:07.599 --> 01:28:10.122
We couldn't just give up Ivan
like that.

01:28:10.265 --> 01:28:14.220
Business is business,
you know well, man.

01:28:14.366 --> 01:28:16.264
What do you say, Pedro?

01:28:17.466 --> 01:28:19.659
<i>Pedro not say nothin'?</i>

01:28:19.766 --> 01:28:22.198
Pressure don't reach him yet.

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:27.365
Ivan.

01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:30.859
How your shoulder?

01:28:30.967 --> 01:28:32.796
Painful, you know.

01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:36.128
All right. This is supposed
to drive down the pain, you know.

01:28:44.901 --> 01:28:47.527
I hear some people sayin'
they catch me.

01:28:47.668 --> 01:28:51.862
No news, man. Propaganda.
Pure propaganda.

01:28:53.469 --> 01:28:56.924
I sent them a picture.
How come they don't publish it?

01:28:57.036 --> 01:28:59.434
Compulsory.

01:28:59.535 --> 01:29:02.399
Everything quiet.
I don't like it.

01:29:05.603 --> 01:29:08.592
So what's happening
in the trade?

01:29:08.703 --> 01:29:13.102
Well, most of the boys
holding out.

01:29:13.204 --> 01:29:16.602
But I don't like what I hear.

01:29:16.737 --> 01:29:18.862
What?

01:29:19.003 --> 01:29:21.265
Jose.

01:29:21.371 --> 01:29:26.770
Him offer some of the boys
a raise... in export.

01:29:28.671 --> 01:29:31.160
But that is what I after.

01:29:31.271 --> 01:29:35.465
Some of them get
what they look for now.

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:41.303
But now that they get what them want
and nobody see me, they might forget me.

01:29:41.405 --> 01:29:45.394
No, man.
Some of us still backing you, you know,

01:29:45.506 --> 01:29:48.370
to get rid of Jose altogether.

01:29:48.473 --> 01:29:52.133
But you'd better try to get away
before it's too late.

01:29:53.639 --> 01:29:55.537
I'm not running, Pedro.

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:03.070
Yes. Freddie.
Him get a job on a boat.

01:30:03.173 --> 01:30:05.071
And him can get you to Cuba.

01:30:06.841 --> 01:30:08.739
And you'd get
a big welcome there.

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:17.096
Yes.
Revolutionary to Ras.

01:30:17.208 --> 01:30:20.197
Could get a doctor
to fix me shoulder too.

01:30:20.308 --> 01:30:22.206
<i>True.</i>

01:30:24.608 --> 01:30:28.938
<i>Go down to the coast
tomorrow and wait there.</i>

01:30:29.042 --> 01:30:32.497
And the boat
will pick you up at the key.

01:30:34.542 --> 01:30:37.269
All right.

01:30:37.376 --> 01:30:40.308
But I have to see Elsa
and Rupert before I go.

01:30:40.409 --> 01:30:42.500
You will see them, man.
You'll see them.

01:30:56.810 --> 01:31:00.572
<i>Sitting here in limbo</i>

01:31:00.677 --> 01:31:04.041
<i>But I know it won't be long</i>

01:31:08.578 --> 01:31:11.908
<i>Sitting here in limbo</i>

01:31:12.010 --> 01:31:15.443
<i>Like a bird without a song</i>

01:31:19.611 --> 01:31:23.237
<i>Well, they're putting up resistance</i>

01:31:23.345 --> 01:31:26.971
<i>But I know that my faith
will lead me on</i>

01:31:32.113 --> 01:31:35.705
<i>Sitting here in limbo</i>

01:31:35.812 --> 01:31:39.006
<i>Waiting for the dice to roll</i>

01:31:43.747 --> 01:31:47.180
<i>Sitting here in limbo</i>

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:50.678
<i>Going back I have to go</i>

01:31:54.581 --> 01:31:57.547
<i>Well, they're putting up resistance</i>

01:31:57.647 --> 01:32:01.875
<i>But I know that my faith
will lead me on</i>

01:32:06.523 --> 01:32:14.523
Sitting in limbo, Sitting in limbo,...

01:32:25.117 --> 01:32:28.481
It's all right, Rupert. Never mind.

01:32:28.584 --> 01:32:31.244
Never mind.

01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:34.248
Never mind.

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:38.816
Well, I hope the ambulance
won't come, you know.

01:32:38.917 --> 01:32:41.008
I prefer no send him
to the hospital.

01:32:41.151 --> 01:32:45.675
When he comes out of the hospital,
it's the same thing all over again.

01:32:45.785 --> 01:32:50.877
But, Elsa,
I can't stand him cry, you know.

01:32:50.985 --> 01:32:54.145
When the trade
going to start again?

01:32:54.252 --> 01:32:58.981
They want Ivan, you know.
Definite.

01:32:59.085 --> 01:33:01.347
All the boys said
them ready to start.

01:33:01.452 --> 01:33:02.941
What you say?

01:33:03.053 --> 01:33:04.951
I say no.

01:33:07.453 --> 01:33:09.351
What you say, Elsa?

01:33:09.453 --> 01:33:12.510
You know what I say, Pedro.

01:33:12.653 --> 01:33:16.585
Every game I play, I lose.

01:33:39.489 --> 01:33:42.081
- Yes?
- I want to talk to you, sir.

01:33:42.188 --> 01:33:45.120
I was just going out.

01:33:45.255 --> 01:33:47.312
But I can spare you
a few minutes.

01:33:50.123 --> 01:33:53.089
Mr. Ray, the traders don't know
where him is, sir.

01:33:53.223 --> 01:33:57.053
They don't know. They don't tell
me, sir. Them don't know, sir!

01:34:01.090 --> 01:34:03.716
- Hmm.
- You know what gonna happen?

01:34:03.823 --> 01:34:07.653
Them gonna start without me, and I won't be
able to control them 'cause them hungry now.

01:34:07.757 --> 01:34:09.814
If they start again,
I'm going to lock them up.

01:34:09.923 --> 01:34:13.321
<i>Don't matter. Them gonna start again
because them desperate.</i>

01:34:13.424 --> 01:34:15.822
If them start without me,
none of us will be able to control them.

01:34:15.924 --> 01:34:19.822
Any criminal can come trade and
don't have to pay no protection money.

01:34:19.924 --> 01:34:22.049
<i>- That's your problem.
- My problem, sir?</i>

01:34:22.191 --> 01:34:25.214
Look what policeman you have, and them
can't find. You want me to find him.

01:34:25.358 --> 01:34:27.586
You have a million
and one policeman.

01:34:27.692 --> 01:34:30.250
<i>Right, sir?
But me one must go find him.</i>

01:34:30.358 --> 01:34:32.881
You don't understand, Jose?

01:34:32.992 --> 01:34:35.458
I stopped chasin' Ivan now.

01:34:35.559 --> 01:34:37.650
I want the traders
to bring him to me.

01:34:37.759 --> 01:34:40.419
<i>- That is the only way this thing
is going to start back.</i>

01:34:52.727 --> 01:34:54.886
Yes?

01:34:55.026 --> 01:34:56.924
Yes, Reverend.

01:34:58.027 --> 01:35:00.459
His woman came to you for help.

01:35:26.095 --> 01:35:29.857
Okay, Corporal. Come, let's go.
Come on. Start the engines.

01:35:48.864 --> 01:35:52.853
<i>The gal said him leaving today.
What boat is he leaving on?</i>

01:35:52.964 --> 01:35:55.759
You realize if you don't help me
now, you can never trade again.

01:35:55.865 --> 01:35:58.161
- You want me hit him again?
- No, we're wasting time.

01:35:58.297 --> 01:36:00.957
Come.
We'll get another boat.

01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:06.430
Swim, Ivan! Swim!

01:37:12.903 --> 01:37:14.426
<i>Grab the rope!</i>

01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:18.700
Hold on, man!

01:38:36.809 --> 01:38:40.139
<i>Got your mind set on a dream</i>

01:38:40.242 --> 01:38:43.731
<i>You can get it
though hard it may seem now</i>

01:38:43.842 --> 01:38:47.366
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:51.306
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:54.274
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>

01:38:54.376 --> 01:38:56.308
<i>But you must try</i>

01:38:56.410 --> 01:38:58.035
<i>Try and try</i>

01:38:58.144 --> 01:39:00.201
<i>Try and try</i>

01:39:00.311 --> 01:39:03.209
<i>You'll succeed at last</i>

01:39:05.544 --> 01:39:07.840
<i>I know it</i>

01:40:38.417 --> 01:40:40.815
<i>We're going to do a frontal assault!</i>

01:40:40.816 --> 01:40:42.717
All right. Hold on.

01:40:42.818 --> 01:40:44.909
Prepare to assault!

01:40:47.918 --> 01:40:49.816
All right.

01:40:51.285 --> 01:40:53.183
Don't worry
with the army business.

01:40:54.552 --> 01:40:56.450
One man just come out.

01:40:58.318 --> 01:41:00.876
Who's the bad man?
Who can draw?

01:41:03.086 --> 01:41:05.678
Come on out, one who can draw!

01:41:09.486 --> 01:41:12.748
One who can draw, just come out!

01:41:12.853 --> 01:41:15.978
<i>Shut your mouth. He think the hero
can't die until the last reel?</i>

01:41:16.087 --> 01:41:18.315
Send out one bad man!

01:41:24.421 --> 01:41:27.182
Send him out!

01:41:32.255 --> 01:41:34.153
Draw!

01:41:39.421 --> 01:41:44.421
<i>Well, the oppressors
are trying to keep me down</i>

01:41:44.789 --> 01:41:48.915
<i>Trying to drive me underground</i>

01:41:49.022 --> 01:41:53.785
<i>And they think that
they have got the battle won</i>

01:41:53.889 --> 01:41:58.912
<i>I say "Forgive them, Lord
they know not what they've done"</i>

01:41:59.023 --> 01:42:03.456
<i>'Cause as sure as the sun will shine</i>

01:42:03.556 --> 01:42:06.556
<i>I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine</i>

01:42:07.556 --> 01:42:12.785
<i>And then the harder they come
the harder they'll fall</i>

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:14.459
<i>One and all</i>

01:42:17.925 --> 01:42:22.051
<i>Harder they come
the harder they'll fall</i>

01:42:22.158 --> 01:42:25.022
<i>One and all</i>

01:42:26.358 --> 01:42:28.256
<i>Oh, yeah</i>
