who was easily outraged

that impeachment

resigned from office

03:45.140 --> 03:47.800

Okay, that's five,

Good evening.
This is the 37th time

04:19.500 --> 04:22.260

from this office

04:22.340 --> 04:24.880

have been made

04:24.970 --> 04:27.470
that have shaped
the history of our nation.

04:27.550 --> 04:29.550
l remember exactly
where l was.

04:30.970 --> 04:34.310
My father called.
The phone rang, my father
called and he said,

04:34.390 --> 04:37.650
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."

04:37.730 --> 04:41.440
l was at home with friends,
and we were watching
television at home.

04:41.530 --> 04:44.320
We stayed up and,
like everyone else,
l'd been glued to

04:44.400 --> 04:46.910
the Select and Judiciary
Committee hearings
night after night.

04:46.990 --> 04:49.120
And then finally,
it had come to this.

04:49.200 --> 04:54.960
Therefore, l shall resign
the presidency effective
at noon tomorrow.

04:55.040 --> 04:58.040
But instead of
the satisfaction
l imagined l'd feel,

04:58.130 --> 05:00.380
l just got angrier
and angrier,

05:00.460 --> 05:03.210
because there was
no admission of guilt.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.720
There was no apology.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.170
Little did l know

05:06.260 --> 05:08.390
that l would one day
be part of the team

elicit that apology.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.600
l have never been a quitter.

05:19.690 --> 05:21.320
And that that team
would be led

05:21.400 --> 05:25.110

of white knights,

05:25.190 --> 05:27.110

political convictions
whatsoever,

a man who, as far as l know,
had never even voted
once in his life.

05:32.240 --> 05:36.370

Well, we in the Nixon camp

06:24.670 --> 06:26.130
really didn't know that much
about David Frost,

06:26.210 --> 06:29.220
other than he was
a British talk show host

06:29.300 --> 06:31.050
with something of
a playboy reputation.

06:31.140 --> 06:34.850
He'd had a talk show
here in the US that
had won some awards

06:34.930 --> 06:40.020
but hadn't syndicated well
and had been dropped
by the network.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.560
He ended up taking
it down to Australia,

06:41.650 --> 06:45.400

where he was when
the President resigned.

So what's so important
that it couldn't wait,
that it had to be today?

08:49.860 --> 08:54.280
l've had an idea, John,
rather a bold idea
for an interview.

were to say yes,

well, he's rather
a big fish that swims
in not-untricky waters.

that l'd want a dear friend

09:21.600 --> 09:24.430

l know by my side.

Well, how would you
expect me to look?

09:44.330 --> 09:46.160
Weren't they terrific?

09:46.250 --> 09:50.250
Come on, John,
we've done political
interviews before.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.000
So, okay, so what
kind of interview?

09:54.090 --> 09:59.300
A full, extensive
look-back over his life,
his presidency.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.930
And?

10:01.010 --> 10:02.430
And what?
Come on, David.

10:02.510 --> 10:03.970
Surely the only thing
that would interest anyone

10:04.060 --> 10:06.390
about Richard Nixon
would be a confession.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.230
A full,
no-holds-barred
confession.

10:08.310 --> 10:10.520
Well, we'll get that, too.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.610
From Richard Nixon?

10:11.690 --> 10:12.980
Come on, John.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.360
Just think of the
numbers it would get.

10:16.110 --> 10:17.780
Do you know how
many people watched

10:17.860 --> 10:19.450

in the White House?

10:19.530 --> 10:21.570
Four hundred million.

10:22.950 --> 10:24.950
But in the end,
David heard nothing.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.660
And soon after
arriving in California,

10:26.750 --> 10:30.370
Nixon was rushed
to hospital with an acute
attack of phlebitis.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.220
l think it was
around this time
that Gerald Ford,

10:46.310 --> 10:47.310
who was the new President,

10:47.390 --> 10:49.480
and who was desperate
to move the agenda
on from Watergate,

10:49.560 --> 10:52.650
gave Nixon a full,
free and absolute pardon.

10:52.730 --> 10:55.440
Now therefore, I,
Gerald R. Ford,

10:55.520 --> 10:58.150
President of
the United States,

10:58.240 --> 11:02.160
have granted,
and by these presents
do grant,

11:02.240 --> 11:04.780
a full,
free and absolute pardon

11:04.870 --> 11:10.040
unto Richard Nixon
for all offenses
against the United States.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.500
lt meant that the man
who had committed
the greatest felony

11:12.580 --> 11:15.250
in American political history
would never stand trial.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.750
lt was like he slipped
out the back door.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.720
A public opinion
poll indicates

11:20.800 --> 11:24.180
a two-to-one disapproval
of the pardoning
of Richard Nixon.

11:24.260 --> 11:27.430

from Virginia said,
"Roosevelt had his New Deal,

11:27.520 --> 11:31.100
"Truman had his Fair Deal,

his crooked deal."

11:31.190 --> 11:33.190
There was no deal, period.

11:33.270 --> 11:35.610
l don't think the truth
will ever come out.

11:35.690 --> 11:37.360
The American people
need to know the truth,

11:37.440 --> 11:40.650
and l don't think
it will ever now
be fully known.

want to address
the college protests?

12:06.680 --> 12:07.890

12:20.860 --> 12:23.070
You're gonna get
a kick out of this.

12:23.150 --> 12:26.360
This is my literary agent
from Hollywood.

12:26.450 --> 12:28.660
Hygiene obsessive.

12:31.540 --> 12:34.080
Mr. President,
good to see you.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.790
Nice to see you.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.460
These are folks
helping me with my book.

12:38.540 --> 12:41.420
Diane Sawyer,
Frank Gannon,
lrving Lazar.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.090
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.

12:43.170 --> 12:44.880
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.810
Okay, that's it.
l'll see you after lunch.

12:50.890 --> 12:52.890
SWlFTY: So how
you feeling, sir?

12:53.310 --> 12:57.850
l'm better, thank you.
Though not yet
well enough to golf,

12:58.690 --> 13:01.570
thank God.
l despise that game.

13:02.570 --> 13:05.110
lmagine, six weeks
out of office

13:05.200 --> 13:07.700
as President
of the United States,

13:07.780 --> 13:10.620
and they'd have me putting
in my hospital room.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.700
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.

13:13.160 --> 13:18.080
To me, the unhappiest
people of the world
are retired.

13:18.170 --> 13:19.960
No purpose.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.800
What makes life mean
something is purpose.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.760
A goal. A battle. A struggle.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.050
Well, even if
you don't win it.

13:28.550 --> 13:31.050
When my doctor
declared me unfit

13:31.140 --> 13:32.970
to give testimony
in the Watergate trial,

13:33.060 --> 13:35.270
everybody thought
l'd be relieved.

13:35.350 --> 13:36.940
Well, they were wrong.

13:37.020 --> 13:38.520
That was the lowest l got.

13:38.600 --> 13:43.020
Well, if it's a challenge
you want, here's one
you might enjoy.

13:43.110 --> 13:47.030
How to spend $2 million,
2.3 to be precise.

13:47.110 --> 13:48.910
lt's what l got
for your memoirs.

13:48.990 --> 13:50.450
Well, thank you.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.780
Eh. . .

13:51.870 --> 13:53.620
lt might be a little short
of what l wanted,

13:53.700 --> 13:57.250
but let me assure you,
it's a whole lot more
than they wanted.

13:57.330 --> 13:59.330
That book is important to me.

13:59.420 --> 14:03.130
lt's probably the only
chance l'm gonna get
to put the record straight

14:03.210 --> 14:06.590
and remind people
the Nixon years
weren't all bad.

14:08.050 --> 14:11.930
You know, if you're trying
to put the record straight,

14:12.010 --> 14:13.470
l'd at least talk to him.

14:13.560 --> 14:14.680
N lXON : Who?

14:15.100 --> 14:18.430
David Frost.
English talk show guy.

14:19.190 --> 14:22.060
Why would l want to
talk to David Frost?

14:22.150 --> 14:24.940
Well, a while back,
he wrote asking
for an interview.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.360
No.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.740
Well, we didn't
get back to him.

14:27.820 --> 14:30.150
Frankly, we didn't
find him appropriate.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.990
Well, l thought
that we were
doing one with CBS.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.030
We are. l just figured
doing it with Frost

14:35.120 --> 14:37.200
would be a whole lot
easier than doing it
with Mike Wallace.

14:37.290 --> 14:41.620
lt would, but it would
have a lot less,
you know, credibility.

14:41.710 --> 14:45.250
True, true. Could
probably get more money.

14:48.050 --> 14:49.800
Really?
Look.

14:49.880 --> 14:53.260
We'll always have
350 on the table
from CBS.

14:53.350 --> 14:57.100
But if l could get
Frost to pay more
and secure better terms,

14:57.600 --> 14:59.680
it might be a shame to pass.

15:00.270 --> 15:03.480
lt'd be interesting to know
where he is right now.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.480
We tied him to
railway tracks,
and he escaped.

15:07.030 --> 15:09.820
We buried him alive,
and he walked free.

15:09.900 --> 15:14.280
Today we're lowering
escape artist Derek Harrison
into the water

15:14.370 --> 15:18.700
to see if he can
miraculously
cheat death once more.

15:18.790 --> 15:21.210
Good evening,
and welcome to
Great Escapes.

15:21.290 --> 15:23.210
My name is David Frost.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.840
DlRECTOR:
Okay, that is a cut.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.000
Thank you.

15:28.090 --> 15:31.380
ln any deal, you need to
know your opponent's
breaking point.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.470
To assess that,
you might call them

15:34.550 --> 15:36.800
late at night
or at the weekend.

15:37.430 --> 15:40.270
lf they take the call,
you know they're desperate.

15:40.350 --> 15:43.770
And from that moment on,
you know you have
the upper hand.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.190
(PHON E RlNGlNG)

15:54.870 --> 15:55.990
Hello?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.780
Mr. Frost? lrving Lazar.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.620
Who?

16:00.700 --> 16:03.870
Swifty Lazar.
l represent
President Nixon.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.250
What time is it?

16:05.330 --> 16:06.290
Bad time?

16:06.380 --> 16:09.170
(STUTTERlNG) No! Not at all.

16:12.220 --> 16:16.050
l'm calling with regard
to your request
for an interview

16:16.140 --> 16:19.140
and to say,
having considered it,

16:19.220 --> 16:23.180
my client is not
necessarily opposed
to the idea.

16:23.270 --> 16:26.980
Really?
Well, that's
terrific news!

16:27.060 --> 16:28.820
For God's sake.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.940
SWIFTY: I got $500,000.

16:31.030 --> 16:32.400
ls that good?

16:32.490 --> 16:37.120
Mr. President,
it's a half a million dollars
for a news interview.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.450
lt's unprecedented.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.700
Yeah? Well, what's the catch?

16:40.790 --> 16:43.960
With Frost? None.
lt'll be a big wet kiss.

16:44.540 --> 16:47.170
This guy'll be so grateful
to be getting it at all,

16:47.250 --> 16:48.920
he'll pitch
puffballs all night

16:49.000 --> 16:51.840
and pay a half
a million dollars
for the privilege.

16:55.220 --> 16:57.590
Well, you think
you could get 550?

16:58.890 --> 17:00.220
l got 6.

17:01.930 --> 17:03.770
BlRT: David, how could
you have done that?
What?

17:03.850 --> 17:05.770
$600,000. That's a fortune.

17:05.850 --> 17:06.850
200 on signature?

17:06.940 --> 17:08.350
Don't worry about the money.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.820
My God.
Most Americans think
he belongs in jail.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.570
You're making him
a rich man.

17:12.650 --> 17:14.570
Plus, by outbidding them,
you've already made enemies

17:14.650 --> 17:16.150
of the networks.
They're just jealous.

17:16.240 --> 17:18.740
They're already sounding off
about checkbook journalism.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.240
And if the networks
are against you,

17:20.330 --> 17:21.700
syndication's always
going to be a struggle.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.370
No syndication,
no advance sales.

17:23.450 --> 17:24.950
No advance sales,
no commercials.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.460
No commercials, no revenue.

17:26.540 --> 17:30.210
And here's the bigger
question, why do it?
You don't need it.

17:30.290 --> 17:31.380
Your career's
in great shape.

17:31.460 --> 17:33.630
This will just spread you
across three continents,

17:33.710 --> 17:35.300
jeopardize the other shows.

17:35.380 --> 17:36.760
lsn't it true that
Channel Nine in Australia

17:36.840 --> 17:38.550
want you to do
another season
of your talk show for them?

17:38.640 --> 17:39.680
Yes.
And London, too?

17:39.760 --> 17:41.890
Yes, but that would be
London and Australia.

17:41.970 --> 17:43.720
This would be. . .
What?

17:44.310 --> 17:45.810
You wouldn't
understand, John.

17:45.890 --> 17:48.730
You were never
part of the show
in New York,

17:49.350 --> 17:51.150
but it's indescribable.

17:51.230 --> 17:56.320
Success in America
is unlike success
anywhere else.

17:57.740 --> 17:59.780
And the emptiness
when it's gone.

18:01.160 --> 18:06.620
And the sickening
thought that it may
never come back.

18:07.540 --> 18:09.920
You know, there's
a restaurant in New York
called Sardi's.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.750
Ordinary mortals
can't get a table.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.500
John, the place
was my canteen !

18:13.590 --> 18:14.670
You know, l'd be happier

18:14.760 --> 18:15.960
if l heard
some kind of vision

18:16.050 --> 18:17.220
that you had
for this interview.

18:17.300 --> 18:18.420
MAN : Excuse me, Mr. Frost.

18:18.510 --> 18:19.630
l'd heard you were
going to be here.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.640
Would you mind?
Of course.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.220
But l don't.
l just hear
a man doing it

18:23.310 --> 18:24.560
because it would
create headlines

18:24.640 --> 18:26.720
or give him a place
at the top table.

18:26.810 --> 18:28.140
And that is what
makes me nervous.

18:28.230 --> 18:30.940
And you do nervous
so beautifully, John.

18:31.020 --> 18:34.360
"Hello, good evening
and welcome."

18:34.820 --> 18:36.360
(FROST LAUGHS)

18:37.530 --> 18:39.450
l don't actually say that.

18:39.530 --> 18:41.110
Hello, Mr. Frost.

18:47.700 --> 18:48.910
Champagne?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.710
CAROLlN E: No, thank you.

18:51.710 --> 18:53.750
FLlGHT ATTEN DANT:
Another glass, sir?

19:11.270 --> 19:13.440
You don't like champagne?

19:14.900 --> 19:16.480
Not on airplanes.

19:16.570 --> 19:18.860
Yes, it dehydrates
one terribly.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.320
The trick is to have
a glass of water
on the go, too.

19:22.410 --> 19:24.950
Like the Viennese
serve coffee.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.290
Well, l've never
been to Vienna.

19:27.370 --> 19:29.830
Oh. Well, you'd like it.

19:29.910 --> 19:32.920
lt's like Paris
without the French.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.500
What's your name?

19:37.590 --> 19:38.750
Caroline.

19:38.840 --> 19:39.840
David.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.630
Yes, l know. David Frost.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.430
"Hello and good evening
and welcome."

19:51.190 --> 19:54.850
You know, l heard
an interview with you
recently on the radio.

19:54.940 --> 19:57.270
You were giving it
from the back
of your Rolls-Royce.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.480
Bentley.

19:58.570 --> 19:59.610
On the phone.

19:59.690 --> 20:00.940
They said that
you were a person

20:01.030 --> 20:04.030
who defined
the age we live in.

20:04.110 --> 20:05.740
Really?
Mmm.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.870
You and Vidal Sassoon.

20:09.580 --> 20:12.540
But what made you
exceptional, they said,

20:12.620 --> 20:16.540
was that you were a person
who had achieved great fame

20:16.630 --> 20:19.960
without possessing
any discernible quality.

20:20.050 --> 20:21.260
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.

20:21.340 --> 20:24.630
And that you fly
around a great deal.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.010
Well, that's true.

20:27.930 --> 20:28.890
Why?

20:28.970 --> 20:30.470
l like to keep busy.

20:31.140 --> 20:32.520
Why?

20:32.600 --> 20:35.140
l find it
more interesting
than keeping still.

20:36.230 --> 20:38.150
You know,
you have very sad eyes.

20:38.860 --> 20:40.650
Do l?
Mmm.

20:40.730 --> 20:42.740
Has anyone told
you that before?

20:43.280 --> 20:44.530
No.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.280
Are you a sad person?

20:50.160 --> 20:52.700
Let's talk about
you a little bit.

20:52.790 --> 20:55.250
Of course, you feel more
comfortable asking questions.

20:55.330 --> 20:57.290
How right you are!

20:57.630 --> 20:59.340
This is your
captain speaking.

20:59.420 --> 21:00.420
You may have
noticed we've begun

21:00.500 --> 21:02.630
our final descent
into Los Angeles.

21:03.510 --> 21:06.590
lf you could please
return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts,

21:06.680 --> 21:08.720
we'll be landing
very shortly. Thank you.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.100
CAROLlN E: So how about you?
Where are you going?

21:11.180 --> 21:13.520
To meet Richard Nixon.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.850
Really?

21:16.520 --> 21:19.310
You know, they say he has
the most enormous head,

21:19.770 --> 21:21.320
but the sexiest voice.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.780
Where is he now?

21:23.030 --> 21:26.570
ln some dark underground cave
licking his wounds?

21:27.450 --> 21:30.200
Actually, no.
ln his rather smart
beachside villa

21:30.280 --> 21:31.330
in California.

21:31.410 --> 21:34.120
Really? Richard Nixon
in a beachside villa?

21:34.200 --> 21:35.790
How incongruous.

21:35.870 --> 21:37.870
You can come if you'd like.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.040
To meet Nixon?

21:40.750 --> 21:42.460
Why not?

21:43.840 --> 21:45.130
Are you sure?

21:48.180 --> 21:49.840
You know, l would love that.

21:49.930 --> 21:52.100
PILOT: Cabin crew,
please prepare for arrival.

21:52.180 --> 21:55.020
Well, l'll get
my office to call you
first thing in the morning

21:55.100 --> 21:57.640
and send a car with a phone.

21:57.730 --> 21:58.730
Oh.

22:01.190 --> 22:04.230
He did, too. Money no object.

22:04.320 --> 22:08.320
Everything glittered
and was golden.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.820
Well, on the outside.

22:09.910 --> 22:12.740
Of course, what I didn't know
was that in the meantime,

22:12.830 --> 22:14.990
he'd gone to all
the major networks

22:15.080 --> 22:17.540
to try and get
interest in the interviews.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.920
l'm sorry, David,
but we have a policy

22:21.000 --> 22:23.420
of not paying
for a news interview.

22:23.500 --> 22:26.670
Look, we love your work
as an entertainer.

22:26.760 --> 22:27.840
That Guinness show?

22:27.920 --> 22:29.430
Love it. You're a funny guy.

22:29.510 --> 22:31.680
But an interview like this?

22:31.760 --> 22:34.680
You're asking us to pay
a British talk show host

22:34.770 --> 22:36.970
to interview
an American president

22:37.060 --> 22:40.690
with absolutely no
editorial controls
whatsoever in return?

22:40.770 --> 22:42.730
Well, you can't say
it's not a fresh approach.

22:42.810 --> 22:44.570
l know you're very busy.

22:44.690 --> 22:46.610
l'm not gonna
keep you from it.

22:47.280 --> 22:48.860
Thank you for coming in.

22:48.950 --> 22:51.030
l'm gonna have to
get back to you.

22:51.110 --> 22:53.950
Okay, thank you so
much for your time.

22:54.030 --> 22:55.080
David, good luck.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.540
He never let on
to anyone at the time,

22:57.620 --> 22:58.790
not even me.
You know,
that would have meant. . .

22:59.710 --> 23:00.710
Thanks.

23:00.790 --> 23:04.340
...admitting failure,
and David doesn't do failure.

23:35.450 --> 23:37.370
FROST: There you are.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.950
See, you don't have
to do a thing yourself.

23:42.420 --> 23:45.290
(lN DlSTlNCT)

23:59.270 --> 24:00.350
Well.

24:01.020 --> 24:02.140
You found it okay.

24:02.230 --> 24:03.350
Yes, thank you.

24:03.440 --> 24:04.600
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Frost.

24:04.690 --> 24:05.770
And you, sir.

24:05.860 --> 24:07.360
May l present
Caroline Cushing?

24:07.440 --> 24:08.480
Miss Cushing.

24:08.570 --> 24:10.650
Hello.
Your house is
very beautiful.

24:10.740 --> 24:11.900
Really. Very romantic.

24:11.990 --> 24:13.070
Well, thank you.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.950
And my producer, John Birt.

24:15.030 --> 24:16.570
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?

24:16.660 --> 24:20.080
This is Mr. Lazar,
and this is Jack Brennan.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.460
Now, Miss Cushing,
would you like
to take a tour,

24:22.540 --> 24:24.830
you know,
maybe stretch your legs
after your long journey?

24:24.920 --> 24:27.590
Yes, please.
l'd love that. Thank you.

24:28.630 --> 24:30.670
Come on in.
This is my office.

24:30.760 --> 24:34.880
Now, this is where Brezhnev
and l had our summit.

24:34.970 --> 24:39.350
Yeah. Brezhnev was there,
and Gromyko there,
Dobrynin there.

24:40.020 --> 24:43.520
We talked for
nine hours straight.

24:44.730 --> 24:48.190
After the meeting,
as a souvenir of the visit,

24:48.270 --> 24:52.530
l remember that we had
a Lincoln specially made.

24:52.610 --> 24:55.820
Dark blue,
cherry wood, leather.

24:55.910 --> 24:58.530
Well, we got inside
for the photographers,

24:58.620 --> 25:02.870
when the next thing you know,
he steps on the gas.

25:02.950 --> 25:07.670
Now, the first rule
of political life is

25:07.750 --> 25:12.170
you never let a president
get behind the wheel
of a car, ever.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.260
l mean, we're not
used to doing anything

25:14.340 --> 25:16.300
for ourselves,
let alone drive.

25:16.380 --> 25:19.550
And the Chairman, Jesus,
the way he put his foot down,

25:19.640 --> 25:22.390
my guess is
the last thing he drove was

25:22.470 --> 25:25.520
a tractor on some
Ukrainian potato farm.

25:27.440 --> 25:28.980
He crashed into curbs.

25:29.060 --> 25:30.520
He went over speed bumps.

25:30.610 --> 25:33.530
He went twice
around my whole estate.

25:33.610 --> 25:38.360
Finally, we ended up
at some remote point
on the coast,

25:38.450 --> 25:41.370
out there
overlooking the sea.

25:41.450 --> 25:45.660
He turns off the gas,
and he talks for two hours

25:45.750 --> 25:49.210
about his favorite subject,
steel mills.

25:49.290 --> 25:52.040
He said, "Mr. President,
most politicians

25:52.130 --> 25:54.800
"have tragedy
in their early lives."

25:55.720 --> 25:59.890
Well, l told him that
l lost two brothers
to tuberculosis.

25:59.970 --> 26:04.970
And he watched his father
die from the cancer
he caught in the steelworks.

26:05.890 --> 26:10.270
He was a sad man
and a noble adversary.

26:10.940 --> 26:13.320
l wouldn't want to
be a Russian leader.

26:13.820 --> 26:16.150
They never know when
they're being taped.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.580
Okay, l guess that's
it then, huh?

26:23.660 --> 26:25.450
Until March.
l look forward to it.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.410
Well, thank you,
Mr. President. So do l.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.080
You know,
it's a funny thing that

26:29.170 --> 26:32.880
l've never been
challenged to a duel before.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.210
l guess that's what this is.

26:34.300 --> 26:36.210
FROST: Yeah, well, not really.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.880
Of course it is.

26:41.010 --> 26:42.680
And l like that.

26:44.010 --> 26:47.930
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.

26:51.810 --> 26:55.980
Mr. Frost, there's still
the small matter of the. . .

26:57.490 --> 26:58.740
Of course.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.660
l do beg your pardon.

27:12.960 --> 27:18.210
Right. $200,000.

27:18.590 --> 27:21.470
l do hope that isn't coming
out of your own pocket.

27:21.550 --> 27:24.640
Well, believe me,
sir, l wish my pockets
were that deep.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.310
Made out in the name of?

27:27.390 --> 27:28.520
lrving Paul Lazar.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.430
Richard M. Nixon.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.570
Here you go.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.740
MANOLO: Okay, smile.

27:45.120 --> 27:48.370
There. Now you can
put that in your
apartment in New York,

27:48.450 --> 27:52.000
and all your liberal friends
can use it as a dartboard.

27:52.080 --> 27:55.790
Well, actually,
l'm living in Monte Carlo
at the moment.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.250
Really?

27:57.340 --> 27:59.170
Yes. Goodbye, Mr. President.

28:00.720 --> 28:03.630
Hey. Take my advice.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.260
You should marry that woman.

28:05.350 --> 28:08.560
Yes. Lovely, isn't she?

28:08.640 --> 28:11.600
More important than that,
she comes from Monaco.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.730
They pay no taxes there.

28:15.020 --> 28:16.940
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.

28:25.450 --> 28:27.070
l bet you it did.

28:27.160 --> 28:28.200
What?

28:28.280 --> 28:29.660
Come out of his own pocket.

28:29.740 --> 28:31.870
You know, he couldn't
look me in the eye.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.540
Well, l hear
the networks
aren't biting.

28:33.620 --> 28:35.710
Without the networks,
the ad agencies
don't want to know.

28:35.790 --> 28:37.040
So if you ask me,
there's a good chance

28:37.130 --> 28:38.250
this whole thing
may never happen.

28:38.340 --> 28:43.550
Really?
So that meeting we just had
might have cost him $200,000?

28:43.630 --> 28:44.720
Correct.

28:45.590 --> 28:49.050
Had l known that,
l would have offered
him a cup of tea.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.890
Say, did you
notice his shoes?

28:51.980 --> 28:53.020
No.

28:53.100 --> 28:56.600
ltalian. No laces.
What do you think?

28:57.400 --> 28:59.770
My people tried to get me
to wear a pair like that.

28:59.860 --> 29:02.440
l think a man's shoes
should have laces, sir.

29:02.650 --> 29:03.650
You do?

29:03.740 --> 29:07.320
Yeah. Personally,
l find those ltalian
shoes very effeminate.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.450
Yes, quite right.

29:13.330 --> 29:15.410
NBC EXECUTIVE: I'm sorry,
David, but it's a no.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.250
Try to look at it
from our point of view.

29:17.330 --> 29:20.250
Why would an American network
hire a total outsider,

29:20.340 --> 29:23.590
and someone who's already
had his own show canceled,
incidentally?

29:23.670 --> 29:25.170
l see. Well, l'm sorry
you feel this way.

29:25.260 --> 29:28.140
Obviously,
l think you're making
a terrible mistake.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.100
N BC.

29:33.520 --> 29:37.600
Well, that's
the networks out,
all of them.

29:39.190 --> 29:41.270
Well, that's the
end of that, then.

29:46.450 --> 29:48.240
l'm sorry, David.

29:48.910 --> 29:50.700
Not so fast.

29:52.120 --> 29:54.620
Where's your
adventurer's spirit?

29:54.700 --> 29:56.660
The idea is
we pay for the program

29:56.750 --> 30:01.790
and syndicate it
ourselves, completely
bypassing the networks.

30:01.880 --> 30:04.460
Just imagine it,
we'd be our own
network for the night.

30:04.550 --> 30:06.420
Hey, Bob.
FROST: How does that grab you?

30:06.510 --> 30:08.340
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.

30:08.430 --> 30:10.260
FROST: No, never been
done before.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.930
Historic stuff.

30:15.310 --> 30:18.390
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.

30:19.060 --> 30:20.520
Yeah?
Yeah.

30:20.610 --> 30:23.650
David, l'd like you
to meet Jim Reston
and Bob Zelnick,

30:23.730 --> 30:24.900
our two prospective
corner men.

30:24.980 --> 30:26.070
Delighted to meet you.

30:26.150 --> 30:27.950
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.

30:28.030 --> 30:29.320
Bob's been
Washington correspondent

30:29.410 --> 30:30.700
for Public Radio
for the past 10 years.

30:30.780 --> 30:32.990
Moving to ABC
in the new year.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.370
The general feeling, David,

30:34.450 --> 30:38.250
is that l have been
wasting my matinee idol
looks on radio.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.870
Jim here teaches
at the University
of North Carolina

30:40.960 --> 30:44.800
and is writing a book
about the criminal
dishonesty, corruption,

30:45.510 --> 30:47.920
paranoia and abuses of
power of Richard Nixon.

30:48.010 --> 30:49.470
Second on the subject.

30:49.550 --> 30:50.590
Fourth.

30:50.680 --> 30:52.720
Well, delighted to
have you both aboard.

30:52.800 --> 30:55.220
Actually, before l sign on,
l would like to hear

30:55.310 --> 30:58.180
what you were
hoping to achieve
with this interview.

30:58.770 --> 31:00.770
What l want to achieve?

31:00.850 --> 31:02.100
Yeah.

31:02.610 --> 31:06.280
Jim, well,
l've secured 12 taping days.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.280
That's close to 30 hours

31:08.360 --> 31:10.530
with the most compelling
and controversial politician

31:10.610 --> 31:12.360
of our times.

31:12.450 --> 31:13.950
lsn't that enough?

31:15.830 --> 31:17.160
Well, not for me.

31:18.500 --> 31:21.830
Look, l'd be giving up
a year of my life.
l'm leaving my family

31:21.920 --> 31:24.540
to work on
a subject matter
that means more

31:24.630 --> 31:26.340
than you can
probably imagine,

31:26.420 --> 31:27.500
and the idea
of doing all that

31:27.590 --> 31:31.010
without achieving what
l want to, personally,

31:31.090 --> 31:32.800
would be unthinkable to me.

31:32.930 --> 31:34.140
(lNTERRU PTlNG)
FROST: No, all right.

31:34.890 --> 31:37.600
Well, what is it that
you want to achieve?

31:43.230 --> 31:46.190
l'd like to
give Richard Nixon
the trial he never had.

31:46.270 --> 31:49.530
Of course,
we'll be asking
difficult questions.

31:49.610 --> 31:51.280
Difficult questions.

31:52.200 --> 31:54.410
The man lost 21,000 Americans

31:54.490 --> 31:56.910
and a million lndo-Chinese
during his administration.

31:56.990 --> 31:59.750
He only escaped jail
because of Ford's pardon.

31:59.830 --> 32:03.120
Yes, but equally,
going after him
in some knee-jerk way,

32:03.210 --> 32:06.750
you know, assuming
he's a terrible guy,

32:06.840 --> 32:10.510
wouldn't that only create
more sympathy for him
than anything else?

32:10.590 --> 32:12.050
(SlGHS) You know. . .

32:14.260 --> 32:16.050
Right now,
l submit it's impossible

32:16.140 --> 32:19.600
to feel anything
close to sympathy
for Richard Nixon.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.810
He devalued the presidency,

32:21.890 --> 32:25.520
and he left the country
that elected him in trauma.

32:26.650 --> 32:30.320
The American people
need a conviction,
pure and simple.

32:30.400 --> 32:33.110
The integrity of
our political system,

32:33.200 --> 32:38.990
of democracy as an idea,
entirely depends on it.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.370
And if in years to come,
people look back

32:41.450 --> 32:42.830
and say it was
in this interview

32:42.910 --> 32:44.500
that Richard Nixon
exonerated himself,

32:44.580 --> 32:46.790
that would be
the worst crime of all.

32:56.510 --> 32:59.550
Did you know that
Mike Wallace is doing
a piece on this?

33:01.520 --> 33:04.180
And that in the bars around
Capitol Hill and Georgetown

33:04.270 --> 33:06.020
this entire project is a joke?

33:06.100 --> 33:08.770
ZELN lCK: Come on.
Jim, come on.

33:08.860 --> 33:11.190
Thanks for that, Jim.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.570
Could you give us
a couple of minutes?

33:21.790 --> 33:23.290
You're unbelievable.
l'm sorry, Bob.

33:23.370 --> 33:25.580
You know, Jim,
l went way out
on a limb for you.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.250
l mean, some of us
actually want this job.

33:27.330 --> 33:28.830
l want it, too,
if it's done right.

33:28.920 --> 33:30.670
Well, how do you know
they're not
gonna do it right?

33:30.750 --> 33:32.000
Little Lord Fauntleroy
in there?

33:32.090 --> 33:33.260
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?

33:33.340 --> 33:34.970
What the. . .
He's full of shit, man !

33:35.050 --> 33:36.590
How do you know that?

33:38.760 --> 33:41.760
ls Mike Wallace
doing a piece on this?

33:43.020 --> 33:44.020
Apparently.

33:44.100 --> 33:45.770
Why didn't you tell me?

33:46.480 --> 33:47.890
lt isn't relevant.

33:48.980 --> 33:52.730
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,

33:53.480 --> 33:57.240
"good with actresses,
not so good with
stonewalling presidents."

33:57.530 --> 33:59.320
That's the general idea, yeah.

33:59.410 --> 34:00.620
Right.

34:01.830 --> 34:04.580
lt's hard not to feel
a little insulted by that.

34:06.290 --> 34:08.710
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.

34:08.790 --> 34:10.000
What are we gonna
do about Reston?

34:10.080 --> 34:11.630
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.

34:11.710 --> 34:12.960
Send him home.

34:14.380 --> 34:16.340
Well, l think
he should stay.
Why?

34:16.420 --> 34:19.720
l liked his passion.

34:19.800 --> 34:21.800
He will drive us
all bloody mad.

34:22.310 --> 34:25.060
Well, maybe, but sometimes
being out of your comfort zone

34:25.140 --> 34:27.810
is a good thing, l'm told.

34:28.810 --> 34:30.100
He stays.

34:40.700 --> 34:44.830
l took my seat
next to Mrs. Mao
at the banquet table.

34:45.450 --> 34:50.170
Now, one of the challenges
of life as a president

34:50.830 --> 34:57.800
is the endless round
of cocktail parties,
social engagements, banquets.

34:58.510 --> 35:00.510
And people who
know me would tell you

35:00.590 --> 35:04.850
that small talk is not one of
my strong suits, either. No.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.600
Particularly not in Mandarin.

35:11.600 --> 35:16.610
So Mrs. Mao and I,
we just, well, you know,
stared at one another.

35:17.740 --> 35:22.030
And then across the table,
Mrs. Nixon and
Chairman Mao himself, well,

35:22.870 --> 35:25.240
they stared
at one another, too.

35:25.330 --> 35:28.160
And then further down,
Dr. Kissinger

35:28.250 --> 35:31.080
and their
foreign minister, well,

35:31.580 --> 35:34.630
you're getting
the picture now.

35:39.300 --> 35:41.260
l can't stand it, Jack!

35:42.550 --> 35:47.720
Reducing the presidency
to a series
of banal anecdotes.

35:47.890 --> 35:50.730
l feel like
a circus animal
doing tricks.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.690
And l thought
l made it clear!

35:52.770 --> 35:57.320
l didn't want to take
any questions
on Watergate, damn it!

35:58.730 --> 36:01.110
Soon as it came
to question time,

36:01.200 --> 36:05.820
all those sons of bitches
ever want to hear about
is Watergate!

36:05.910 --> 36:10.370
lt's as if all
my other achievements
have ceased to exist.

36:10.450 --> 36:11.710
Well, sir, you're
gonna get a chance

36:11.790 --> 36:13.080
to talk about them
sooner than you think.

36:13.170 --> 36:14.830
Yeah? How?

36:14.920 --> 36:17.290
Frost got there.
He got the money.

36:18.590 --> 36:20.010
What?

36:20.090 --> 36:21.510
l understand
most of it's borrowed,

36:21.590 --> 36:23.340
that his friends
have bailed him out.

36:23.430 --> 36:25.640
But the point is,
we start taping
at the end of March.

36:25.720 --> 36:28.430
Really? Now, that's terrific.

36:28.510 --> 36:30.270
How much time is
devoted to Watergate?

36:30.350 --> 36:33.190
25%. Just one of
four 90-minute shows.

36:33.270 --> 36:35.270
What are the other
three divided into?

36:35.350 --> 36:37.360
Domestic Affairs,
Foreign Policy,

36:37.440 --> 36:38.520
and Nixon the Man.

36:38.610 --> 36:39.570
"Nixon the Man"?

36:39.650 --> 36:41.820
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?

36:41.900 --> 36:45.070
Well, l imagine
it's some kind of
biographical piece.

36:46.490 --> 36:50.990
l can see it now.
The father that neglected me,
the brothers that died.

36:51.080 --> 36:53.120
Spare me.

36:53.210 --> 36:58.250
Still, now, the fact
it's come together, now,
that's a good thing, no?

36:58.340 --> 37:01.550
Mr. President, it's fantastic.

37:01.630 --> 37:03.920
Frost is just not in
your intellectual class, sir.

37:04.010 --> 37:07.470
You're gonna be
able to dictate terms,
rebuild your reputation.

37:07.550 --> 37:12.470
lf this went well,
if enough people saw it,
revised their opinion,

37:12.560 --> 37:15.810
you could move back East
way, way earlier
than we expected.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.770
You think?
l'm certain.

37:19.270 --> 37:25.360
lt would be so good
to go back to where
the action is.

37:25.450 --> 37:26.740
You know?

37:26.820 --> 37:30.330
The hunger in my belly
is still there, Jack.

37:33.250 --> 37:36.330
l guess it all boils down
to Watergate, huh?

37:36.420 --> 37:39.080
Well, that's nothing
to worry about, sir.

37:39.170 --> 37:41.880
lt's not as if
there's gonna be
any revelations.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.670
That stuff's been combed over
a million times.

37:44.760 --> 37:47.050
No one has pinned
anything on you.

37:47.130 --> 37:49.590
Yeah, still,
it's been a while

37:49.680 --> 37:51.180
since l spoke about it
on the record.

37:51.260 --> 37:53.010
l'm gonna start
doing my homework.

37:53.100 --> 37:55.850
Hey, you know what would
be an interesting
thing to find out?

37:55.940 --> 37:57.020
What his strategy is.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.140
Now, where's he staying?

37:58.230 --> 37:59.770
l believe The Beverly Hilton.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.360
The Beverly Hilton, you say.

38:01.440 --> 38:03.860
Well, l got
the numbers someplace

38:03.940 --> 38:06.320
of some fellows
that we could send in.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.030
Cubans with ClA training.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.420
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.

38:20.920 --> 38:22.340
Yes, sir.

38:26.170 --> 38:28.170
RESTON: A week later,
we said goodbye
to our families,

38:28.260 --> 38:31.340
we hopped on a plane,
and we moved into
The Beverly Hilton.

38:31.430 --> 38:33.430
And that's where we
started to dig into
our research

38:33.510 --> 38:36.060
and prepare
for the interviews.

38:37.020 --> 38:38.180
Yeah, as it happens, we took

38:38.270 --> 38:40.440
the whole question
of security very seriously.

38:42.820 --> 38:46.230
BlRT: And from day one,
we kept all our files
in a locked safe.

38:49.950 --> 38:53.160
Who was the guy
that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?

38:53.280 --> 38:54.870
BlRT: Haldeman.
RESTON : Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.

38:54.950 --> 38:57.450
l always get
the Germans mixed up.

38:57.540 --> 39:00.120
l'm a little
confused by that.

39:00.210 --> 39:02.960
What is Haldeman's
official. . .
Hello, darling.

39:03.590 --> 39:06.710
As for the work over
the months, we divided it
into three sections.

39:06.800 --> 39:10.340
Birt took Vietnam,
Bob took Foreign
and Domestic Policy,

39:10.430 --> 39:13.600
and l got Watergate
and the abuses of power.

39:13.760 --> 39:16.560
And David,
we never really
saw much of David.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.140
RESTON : All right, so what
about the Huston Plan?

39:18.230 --> 39:20.020
You can see the seeds
of dirty tricks.

39:20.100 --> 39:23.520
Essentially,
it's an attempt to
legalize dirty tricks.

39:23.610 --> 39:25.690
That's why you gotta
get David to put it
in the question.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.860
Wiretapping students.

39:26.940 --> 39:28.360
N IXON ON TAPE: But they've
traced the money to him.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.990
RESTON : Opening people's mail.

39:30.070 --> 39:31.070
What about wiretapping?

39:31.160 --> 39:32.160
How many people
has he wiretapped?

39:32.240 --> 39:34.490
This guy wiretapped
17 people.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.620
BlRT: Seventeen?

39:35.700 --> 39:36.700
lncluding his own brother.

39:36.790 --> 39:38.700
But you know what?
We can't ask him
about his brother,

39:38.790 --> 39:41.540
'cause frankly,
if Donald Nixon
was my brother,

39:41.620 --> 39:43.750
l'd wiretap him, too.

39:44.960 --> 39:48.130
RESTON : But wait, okay,
so we have
breaking and entering.

39:48.380 --> 39:51.840
We have wiretapping,
conspiracy to
foster prostitution.

39:51.930 --> 39:53.180
And that's Liddy, right?

39:57.390 --> 39:59.890
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.

39:59.980 --> 40:01.850
How do we frame a question
about Cambodia,

40:01.940 --> 40:02.940
about the illicit
bombing of Cambodia?

40:03.020 --> 40:04.020
l think you should say,

40:04.110 --> 40:05.730
"How far do you take
executive privilege

40:05.820 --> 40:07.440
"before it becomes
an undemocratic event?"

40:07.530 --> 40:09.780
l think you frame
the question to him
as a Quaker.

40:09.860 --> 40:13.570
"How do you feel as
a Quaker about annihilating
an entire people?"

40:17.080 --> 40:19.660
FROST: Come on.
Are they really
interested in buying time?

40:19.750 --> 40:21.330
Are they going to
give us the money?

40:21.410 --> 40:22.910
How serious are they?

40:23.000 --> 40:26.500
You have to set up that
he has an anti-democratic
personality.

40:26.590 --> 40:28.250
There's a reason they
call him Tricky Dick.

40:28.340 --> 40:31.840
Because l had written about
and watched Nixon for years,

40:31.920 --> 40:34.050
l got to play him
in our rehearsals.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.180
You know,
the fellas would
throw me a question,

40:36.260 --> 40:39.140
and l would try and anticipate
what his response might be.

40:39.220 --> 40:41.270
BlRT: Okay,
the White House
taping system.

40:41.350 --> 40:44.640
Ours is not
the first administration
to use taping systems.

40:44.730 --> 40:46.560
Lyndon Johnson's
White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.

40:46.650 --> 40:49.270
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged
abuses of power.

40:49.360 --> 40:53.190
Let me tell you,
other administrations
were up to far worse.

40:53.450 --> 40:56.610
And just for fun,
your close
friend Jack Kennedy.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.870
That man, he screwed
anything that moved,

41:00.040 --> 41:02.620
fixed elections
and took us into Vietnam.

41:02.710 --> 41:05.000
And the American people,
they loved him for it!

41:05.080 --> 41:08.000
Whereas l,
Richard Milhous Nixon,

41:08.090 --> 41:12.010
worked around the clock
in their service,
and they hated me!

41:12.470 --> 41:16.430
Look. Look. Now l'm sweating.

41:16.510 --> 41:18.930
Damn it! Damn it!

41:19.010 --> 41:22.100
And Kennedy's
so goddamn handsome
and blue-eyed !

41:22.180 --> 41:23.640
And women all over him !

41:23.730 --> 41:26.020
He screwed anything
that moved, and everything.

41:26.100 --> 41:27.350
Had a go at Checkers once.

41:27.440 --> 41:29.860
The poor little bitch
was never the same!

41:31.690 --> 41:35.610
Gentlemen, finally a friend
in the American press.

41:35.700 --> 41:38.320
CAROLlN E: Jack Anderson
in The Washington Post,

41:38.410 --> 41:40.780
"When Richard Nixon faces
the television cameras

"for his first interview

Can l be Crack One?

41:58.140 --> 41:59.590
Can l be Deep Crack?

42:01.760 --> 42:03.640
David, can l talk
to you for a sec?

42:03.720 --> 42:05.100
After researching
my last book,

42:05.180 --> 42:06.520
l was pretty
certain Colson. . .

42:06.600 --> 42:08.850
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?

42:08.980 --> 42:10.270
Colson, right.
Colson had a
meeting with Nixon

42:11.440 --> 42:12.570

but l never knew
the exact date,

42:14.150 --> 42:15.860

find the transcript.

But if you gave me
a week back in the
Federal Courthouse library. . .

42:18.200 --> 42:21.870
A week? Goodness, Jim,
we can't lose you
for that long.

42:21.950 --> 42:23.330
l think this is
really good stuff, Dave.

42:23.410 --> 42:25.370
Would there be something
l could help you with?

42:25.450 --> 42:27.870
You know, if we're
gonna nail Nixon
in these interviews,

42:27.960 --> 42:29.370
we're gonna
have to ambush him.

42:29.460 --> 42:30.790
We're gonna have to
take him by surprise.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.040
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.

42:33.130 --> 42:35.710
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.260
He sounds a little emotional.

42:37.340 --> 42:38.800
l'll take it in here.

42:38.880 --> 42:40.800
He'll be right
with you. Yeah.

Jack.
Watergate.

42:45.680 --> 42:46.770
Yes, Jack.

42:46.850 --> 42:50.440
Our lawyers want us to agree
on a definition of the word.

42:50.520 --> 42:52.400
Well, l believe
it's a large hotel

in Washington, Jack.

42:54.650 --> 42:55.730
You know what
l'm talking about.

42:55.820 --> 42:57.280
For the interviews.

42:57.490 --> 42:59.400
We want to propose
that Watergate

be an umbrella term

43:13.500 --> 43:15.590
the Plumbers Union,
the Enemies List,

43:15.670 --> 43:18.170
you're saying all that
goes into Watergate?

43:18.920 --> 43:20.510
Correct.

43:20.590 --> 43:23.090
That is absurd
and a clear breach

43:23.180 --> 43:25.180
of the terms
of our agreement.

43:25.260 --> 43:28.310
Okay. How would
you define Watergate?

43:28.390 --> 43:29.600
Well, that it covers
just that.

43:29.690 --> 43:31.440
The Watergate
break-in of June 17th

43:31.520 --> 43:33.810
and the subsequent
cover-up and investigation.

43:33.900 --> 43:35.610
Fine. ln which case,
the deal is off.

43:35.690 --> 43:39.190
Fine. ln which case,
you can expect a lawsuit

43:39.320 --> 43:41.450
for something
in excess of $20 million

43:41.530 --> 43:43.570
in damages and
loss of earnings.

43:43.660 --> 43:46.490
The terms of the contract
clearly stipulate

43:46.580 --> 43:50.200
that Watergate take up
no more than 25% of the time.

43:50.290 --> 43:53.170
Yes, but nowhere does it say
that for the rest of the 75%

43:53.250 --> 43:55.750
he gets to drone on
and sound presidential.

43:57.380 --> 44:01.590
"Drone on"? Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?

44:01.680 --> 44:04.470
You remember
who you're
talking about here.

44:04.550 --> 44:08.260
You know as well as l do
that 60% of what he did
in office was right,

44:08.350 --> 44:12.190
and 30% may have been wrong,
but he thought it was right
at the time.

44:12.270 --> 44:14.190
Yes, but that
still leaves 10%

44:14.270 --> 44:16.690
where he was doing
the wrong thing and knew it.

44:17.940 --> 44:21.530
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.

44:22.240 --> 44:25.780
Well, l can guarantee you
if you screw us on the 60%,

the rest of my life.

Come the hour,
he'll be fine. Okay?

45:41.820 --> 45:43.740
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?

45:43.820 --> 45:45.610
Yeah.
That's the word he used?

45:45.700 --> 45:46.900
Yeah, he said "performer."

45:46.990 --> 45:48.110
Not "journalist"
or "interviewer"?

45:48.200 --> 45:51.280

Mr. President. Now,
we're going to be
covering a lot of subjects

54:42.150 --> 54:45.530
in a great deal of detail
over the course
of these interviews,

54:45.610 --> 54:49.490
but l'd like to
begin completely
out of context

54:49.570 --> 54:51.200
by asking you
one question,

54:51.280 --> 54:54.200
more than any other,
almost every American

54:54.290 --> 54:57.450
and people all over
the world want me to ask.

54:59.540 --> 55:01.420
Why didn't you
burn the tapes?

55:04.630 --> 55:06.460
Son of a bitch !

55:09.260 --> 55:15.220
Well, Mr. Frost,
l'm surprised
by your question

55:15.520 --> 55:20.390
since we have an agreement,
a contractual agreement,
l believe,

55:20.480 --> 55:24.730
that we would cover Watergate
in our last taping session.

55:34.030 --> 55:38.500
But if your viewers
really do have
a major concern,

55:38.580 --> 55:43.630
then perhaps l should
briefly respond to it now.

55:43.710 --> 55:46.840
What probably very
few people realize

55:46.920 --> 55:49.130
is that the taping system
in the White House

55:49.220 --> 55:52.470
was set up
by my predecessor,
President Johnson,

55:52.550 --> 55:56.680
partly to avoid
the necessity of having
a secretary in every meeting,

55:56.770 --> 55:59.270
and partly
to ensure there was

55:59.350 --> 56:01.850
a record kept of
every verbal agreement,

56:01.940 --> 56:04.900
no matter how
off the cuff or casual.

56:05.570 --> 56:08.150
Now, initially, on coming
into the White House,

56:08.230 --> 56:11.030
l insisted on
dismantling the system.

56:11.110 --> 56:14.410
l hadn't liked
the idea at all,
but the former President,

56:14.490 --> 56:16.740
President Johnson,
had repeatedly said

56:16.830 --> 56:20.080
how crazy it would be
to remove the system,

56:20.160 --> 56:21.750
which he felt
was the best way. . .

56:21.830 --> 56:24.080
BRENNAN: Well, in boxing,
you know, there's always
that first moment,

56:24.170 --> 56:26.290
and you see it in
the challenger's face.

56:26.380 --> 56:28.500
lt's that moment
that he feels

56:28.590 --> 56:30.920
the impact from
the champ's first jab.

56:31.260 --> 56:35.010
lt's kind of
a sickening moment,
when he realizes that

56:35.100 --> 56:38.390
all those months
of pep talks and the hype,

56:38.470 --> 56:41.600
the psyching yourself up,
had been delusional all along.

56:41.680 --> 56:43.640
You could see it
in Frost's face.

56:43.730 --> 56:45.900
lf he didn't know
the caliber of the man

56:45.980 --> 56:48.110
that he was up against
before the interview started,

56:48.190 --> 56:50.690
he certainly knew
it halfway through
the President's first answer.

56:50.780 --> 56:53.610
N lXON : You see,
since the best advice is

56:53.700 --> 56:57.280
almost always
of the confidential variety,

56:57.370 --> 56:59.540
now the tapes have
been made public,

56:59.620 --> 57:02.080
people are unlikely
ever to feel comfortable

57:02.160 --> 57:04.750
speaking in confidence
at the White House.

57:04.830 --> 57:08.630
They're less likely
to offer that advice.
So in the end,

57:08.710 --> 57:10.920
it's the whole
political system and,

57:11.010 --> 57:13.920
by implication, it's
the country that suffers.

57:14.010 --> 57:16.050
So much for
our "ballsy" opening.

57:18.930 --> 57:22.020
So when did you
actually decide. . .

57:22.100 --> 57:25.020
At what moment did you know
you were going to resign?

57:25.100 --> 57:27.060
That's good. That's good.

57:28.270 --> 57:32.360
l remember exactly.
lt was July 23.

57:32.440 --> 57:35.280
After it was clear
the Southern Democrats

57:35.360 --> 57:36.820
that were still against
impeachment had

57:36.910 --> 57:39.990
had the screws put on them
by the Speaker of the House.

57:40.790 --> 57:47.420
That night l said to
Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."

57:47.830 --> 57:49.420
And, of course,
you know, being Al,

57:49.500 --> 57:51.040
he tried to
talk me out of it.

57:51.130 --> 57:53.880
And Vice President Ford,
l mean, let's not forget

57:53.970 --> 57:57.550
he had the most
to gain personally
from my stepping down,

57:57.640 --> 57:59.470
he was still
absolutely convinced that

57:59.550 --> 58:01.310
we were gonna win
the impeachment vote,

58:01.390 --> 58:03.140
and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.

58:03.220 --> 58:04.220
We have to move this along.

58:04.310 --> 58:05.980
This is desperate, John.
Do something.

58:06.060 --> 58:08.480
Twenty-three minutes
on one question?

58:08.560 --> 58:09.610
Okay, let's take a break.

58:09.690 --> 58:11.020
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.

58:11.110 --> 58:12.320
Stop tape.

58:13.900 --> 58:15.150
DlRECTOR:
l'm sorry, gentlemen.

58:15.240 --> 58:16.860
We have to take a break.
Tape change.

58:16.950 --> 58:19.740
Oh. Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?

58:19.820 --> 58:21.070
lt's fantastic.

58:21.160 --> 58:22.740
Good. Good. Thank you.

58:24.330 --> 58:25.500
Excuse me. One moment, sir.

58:25.580 --> 58:27.660
N lXON : Yeah, sure.
Take your time.

58:28.040 --> 58:30.000
What are you doing, David?
You've got to
stop him rambling.

58:30.080 --> 58:32.250
lt's all right.
These are just
introductory exchanges.

58:32.340 --> 58:33.800
But this session
only lasts two hours.

58:33.880 --> 58:36.550
Nearly half of it's gone,
and we're wasting
valuable material, okay?

58:36.630 --> 58:38.880
The moment that he made
the decision to resign,

58:38.970 --> 58:40.260
we should be scoring
points with that stuff.

58:40.350 --> 58:41.510
Want me to switch to Vietnam?

58:41.600 --> 58:43.060
No. No.
We've got to
get something

58:43.140 --> 58:44.850
out of that
resignation night.
All right?

58:44.930 --> 58:48.520
That was Nixon at
his lowest point,
a total wreck. On his knees?

58:48.600 --> 58:51.060
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail
him with that stuff.

58:51.150 --> 58:52.520
Listen, was that okay?

58:52.610 --> 58:53.860
Perfect, sir.

58:53.940 --> 58:56.610
lt didn't sound too
arrogant or self-serving?

58:56.690 --> 59:00.200
Not at all.
You sounded controlled,
even-handed, statesmanlike.

59:00.280 --> 59:01.450
Good.

59:01.530 --> 59:02.700
Now continue
exactly the same way.

59:02.780 --> 59:04.660
Long answers.
Control the space.

59:04.740 --> 59:05.700
Don't let him in.

59:05.790 --> 59:07.080
Okay, got you.

59:10.290 --> 59:12.330
DAVlS: Set. And roll.

59:17.170 --> 59:22.260
We're coming
back on camera three
in four, three, two and. . .

59:24.680 --> 59:28.730
Reading the account
of those extraordinary
final days,

59:28.810 --> 59:31.270
it seems your most
emotional moment came

59:31.350 --> 59:34.690
in that
heart-to-heart you had
with Henry Kissinger.

59:34.770 --> 59:38.400
Was that perhaps
the most emotional moment
of your career?

59:38.860 --> 59:40.490
RESTON : Good, good.
N lXON: Yes.

59:41.200 --> 59:46.490
l would say it was
about as emotional
a moment as l've ever had.

59:48.660 --> 59:50.790
Except, well,
you know,
it's hard to say

59:50.870 --> 59:52.960
what is the most
emotional moment,

59:53.040 --> 59:55.670
because each is different.

59:56.090 --> 59:59.170
l remember the day
Eisenhower died.

59:59.260 --> 1:00:00.550
For God's sake.

1:00:00.630 --> 1:00:04.890
And the day l walked
my eldest daughter
Tricia down the aisle.

1:00:04.970 --> 1:00:07.640
And the day during
the impeachment hearings

1:00:07.720 --> 1:00:11.350
when Julie,
that's my youngest,
she came into my office,

1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:15.940
she threw her arms around me,
she kissed me.
She cried, you know?

1:00:16.020 --> 1:00:18.900
And she so seldom cries.

1:00:19.110 --> 1:00:21.450
She said, "Daddy, you're
the finest man l know."

1:00:21.530 --> 1:00:23.530
"Daddy, you're
the finest man l know"?

1:00:23.990 --> 1:00:27.490
"And whatever you do,
l will support you.

1:00:28.540 --> 1:00:32.870
"You just gotta
go through the fire,
you know, a little longer."

1:00:35.250 --> 1:00:37.000
This is beautiful.

1:00:37.090 --> 1:00:40.260
So Kissinger and l were
in the Lincoln Sitting Room,

1:00:40.340 --> 1:00:43.300
and together we began
to reminisce

1:00:43.380 --> 1:00:47.220
about some of
the great decisions that
we'd participated in.

1:00:47.310 --> 1:00:50.470
There was China,
the Soviet Union,

1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:53.100
the peace settlement
in Vietnam.

1:00:53.190 --> 1:00:57.190
Now, let me
tell you something that
l never told anybody.

1:00:57.270 --> 1:01:01.740
Whenever l have had
a really tough
decision to make. . .

1:01:02.070 --> 1:01:04.820
Now, we were in
the Lincoln Sitting Room
at that time.

1:01:04.910 --> 1:01:08.580
l have come into this room
for the purpose of praying.

1:01:09.620 --> 1:01:13.500
"Now, Henry,
l'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.

1:01:13.580 --> 1:01:15.500
"Neither of us is
particularly orthodox,

1:01:15.580 --> 1:01:18.630
"but l'd like to think
that each of us
in our own way

1:01:18.710 --> 1:01:21.670
"has a deep
religious sensitivity.

1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:26.840
"So if you don't mind,
could we just have a moment
of silent prayer?"

1:01:26.930 --> 1:01:31.180
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front
of that table where

1:01:31.270 --> 1:01:35.390
Lincoln signed
the Emancipation
Proclamation.

1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:38.940
And then after a few moments,
we both got up again,
and Henry says. . .

1:01:39.020 --> 1:01:40.610
ls there. . . l'm sorry.

1:01:40.730 --> 1:01:41.860
ls there a problem?

1:01:41.940 --> 1:01:42.980
That's time.

1:01:43.570 --> 1:01:45.700
We're over two hours.

1:01:45.780 --> 1:01:47.860
Really? So soon?

1:01:48.570 --> 1:01:51.540
Well, Mr. President,
l gather our time is up.

1:01:51.740 --> 1:01:53.540
Gee, now, that's a pity.

1:01:53.620 --> 1:01:56.120
You know,
l was beginning
to enjoy that.

1:02:00.090 --> 1:02:02.420
That was terrific,
both of you.

1:02:02.510 --> 1:02:03.880
We're getting some
great material.

1:02:03.970 --> 1:02:05.300
You know,
it's so funny, too,

1:02:05.380 --> 1:02:08.800
because l was expecting
questions on Vietnam.

1:02:08.890 --> 1:02:11.390
And we prepared for that,
hadn't we, Jack?

1:02:11.470 --> 1:02:12.850
Yes, so did l.

1:02:12.930 --> 1:02:16.060

just got caught up,
you know, reminiscing.

1:02:16.140 --> 1:02:17.140

1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:20.650
Yes, indeed.

1:02:20.730 --> 1:02:22.440
l look forward to it.
Bye-bye.

1:02:29.910 --> 1:02:31.990

to say anything.

you should ask David.

Are we close, John?

a question you should. . .

We were. But the financing
was always conditional
on advertising sales,

and no one predicted
that they'd fall apart
like this.

Well, why have
they fallen apart?
Based on what?

1:04:06.210 --> 1:04:09.010
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising
sales based on?

l understand your concern.

the extraordinary pressure
that he's under?

'Cause at the moment,
he's effectively paying
for all this himself.

1:07:11.270 --> 1:07:14.520
Mr. President,
you came to office
promising peace,

1:07:14.610 --> 1:07:16.570
but no sooner
did you get into
the White House

1:07:16.650 --> 1:07:21.070
than US involvement
in Vietnam deepened
and the war was prolonged

1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:22.740
with calamitous
consequences.

1:07:22.830 --> 1:07:26.290
Did you feel that you'd
betrayed the people
that had elected you?

1:07:26.370 --> 1:07:30.120
Well, Vietnam
was not my war.

1:07:30.210 --> 1:07:31.880
lt was my inheritance.

1:07:31.960 --> 1:07:33.790
And it looked to me...
Jump in.

1:07:33.880 --> 1:07:36.880
. . .as if the reason
for our being there

1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:41.680
had perhaps not been
adequately understood
by the American people.

1:07:42.090 --> 1:07:44.100
lt seemed to me
they hadn't realized

1:07:44.180 --> 1:07:49.390
how important
a test this was
of American credibility.

1:07:50.100 --> 1:07:52.100
The whole world
was watching to see

1:07:52.190 --> 1:07:55.230
if we have the character
to see it through.

1:07:55.320 --> 1:07:58.070
Now, look,
l could have bugged out.
l could have.

1:07:58.150 --> 1:08:00.780
l could have blamed it
on my predecessors.

1:08:00.860 --> 1:08:03.360
l could have
pulled the troops
out of Vietnam early,

1:08:03.450 --> 1:08:05.740
and very possibly,
l would have won

1:08:05.830 --> 1:08:09.080
some Scandinavian peace prize
into the bargain.

1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:10.790
But l believed
in the cause.

1:08:10.870 --> 1:08:16.210
And sometimes, you know,
what you believe in,
it's the harder path.

of the Vietnam War.

And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody
advised you against.

1:08:28.680 --> 1:08:31.730
All the ClA
and Pentagon intelligence
suggested it would fail.

1:08:31.810 --> 1:08:32.890
So why did you do it?

1:08:32.980 --> 1:08:34.020
Well, first of all,

1:08:34.110 --> 1:08:40.530
as a result of
our incursion into Cambodia,
we picked up 22,000 rifles,

1:08:40.610 --> 1:08:45.120
15 million rounds
of ammunition,
150,000 rockets, mortars.

1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:47.410
That's all belonging
to the North Vietnamese,

1:08:47.490 --> 1:08:50.500
which would only otherwise
have been directed

1:08:50.580 --> 1:08:52.710
right onto
American soldiers.

1:08:52.790 --> 1:08:56.040
But one of
the principal justifications
you gave for the incursion

1:08:56.130 --> 1:08:57.790
was the supposed
existence of

1:08:57.880 --> 1:09:02.760
the "headquarters of
the entire Communist military
operation in South Vietnam,"

1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:06.590
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon"
which proved
not to exist at all.

1:09:06.680 --> 1:09:08.300
No, no. Wait a minute
there. No, l was. . .
And by sending. . .

1:09:08.390 --> 1:09:11.640
And by sending B-52s
to carpet bomb a country,

wiping out
whole civilian areas,

1:09:14.350 --> 1:09:17.360
you end up radicalizing
a once moderate people,

1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:20.070
uniting them in
anti-American sentiment

1:09:20.190 --> 1:09:22.780
and creating a monster
in the Khmer Rouge

1:09:22.860 --> 1:09:24.150
that would lead
to civil war...

l have had my doubts,

the construction worker
in Philadelphia,

No.

that you used the term

You have, you say?

And in this case,

a corrupt motive.

1:32:34.340 --> 1:32:37.880

the direct consequences

not be a cover-up or
obstruction of justice?

Mr. Frost,

1:32:50.810 --> 1:32:54.020
that far from
obstructing justice,

there is no evidence

1:34:27.870 --> 1:34:30.330
clearly shows that
to be a falsehood.

1:34:30.910 --> 1:34:36.410
Now, in it you say
to Colson, "This whole
investigation rests

1:34:37.500 --> 1:34:43.000
"unless one of the seven
begins to talk.

1:34:45.800 --> 1:34:47.510
"That's the problem."

1:34:47.590 --> 1:34:51.100
Well, what do we
mean when we say

1:34:51.180 --> 1:34:53.310
"one of the seven
beginning to talk"?

1:34:53.390 --> 1:34:56.690
Then moving on to
a conversation you had
with John Dean

1:34:56.770 --> 1:34:58.230
on March 21,
the following year.

1:34:58.310 --> 1:35:01.270
ln one transcript alone,
there in black and white,

1:35:01.360 --> 1:35:03.020
l picked out,
and these are your words,

1:35:03.110 --> 1:35:06.820
one,
"You could get $1 million,
and you could get it in cash.

1:35:06.900 --> 1:35:08.320
"l know where it
could be gotten."

1:35:08.410 --> 1:35:11.740
Two, "Your major guy
to keep under control
is Hunt."

1:35:12.330 --> 1:35:15.200
Three,
"Don't we have to handle
the Hunt situation?"

1:35:15.290 --> 1:35:17.040
Four, "Get the million bucks.

1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:19.580
"lt would seem to me
that would be worthwhile."

1:35:19.670 --> 1:35:22.460
Five, "Don't you agree
that you'd better get
the Hunt thing going?"

1:35:22.550 --> 1:35:24.380
Six, "First you've got
the Hunt problem.

1:35:24.460 --> 1:35:27.090
"That ought to be handled."
Seven, "The money
can be provided.

1:35:27.170 --> 1:35:29.630
"Ehrlichman could provide
the way to deliver it."

1:35:29.720 --> 1:35:31.390
Eight,
"We've no choice with Hunt

1:35:31.470 --> 1:35:34.350
"but the $120,000 or
whatever it is, right?"

1:35:34.430 --> 1:35:37.810
Nine, "Christ,
turn over any cash
we've got."

1:35:37.890 --> 1:35:39.350
And l could go on.
Now, it seems to me

1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:41.060
that someone
running a cover-up

1:35:41.150 --> 1:35:43.190
couldn't have expressed it
more clearly than that,
could they?

1:35:43.270 --> 1:35:44.820
Look, let me
just stop you now
right there,

1:35:44.900 --> 1:35:47.030
because you're doing
something here

1:35:47.110 --> 1:35:49.400
which l am not doing,
and l will not do

1:35:49.490 --> 1:35:51.740
throughout these
entire broadcasts.

1:35:51.820 --> 1:35:53.910
You're quoting me
out of context,

1:35:53.990 --> 1:35:56.200
out of order.
And l might add,

1:35:56.290 --> 1:35:58.580
l have participated
in all these interviews

1:35:58.660 --> 1:36:00.460
without a single note
in front of me.

1:36:00.540 --> 1:36:02.040
Well, it is your life,
Mr. President.

1:36:02.130 --> 1:36:03.250
Now, you've always maintained

1:36:03.340 --> 1:36:06.210
that you knew nothing
about any of this
until March 21.

1:36:06.300 --> 1:36:09.840
But in February,
your personal lawyer
came to Washington

1:36:09.930 --> 1:36:12.970
to start the raising
of $219,000

1:36:13.050 --> 1:36:15.050
of hush money to be
paid to the burglars.

1:36:15.140 --> 1:36:18.060
Now, do you seriously
expect us to believe

1:36:18.140 --> 1:36:19.730
that you had
no knowledge of that?

1:36:19.810 --> 1:36:23.100
None. l believed
the money was for
humanitarian purposes.

1:36:23.190 --> 1:36:25.770
To help
disadvantaged people
with their defenses.

1:36:25.860 --> 1:36:29.610
Well, it was being delivered
on the tops of phone booths
with aliases,

1:36:29.700 --> 1:36:31.950
and at airports
by people with gloves on.

1:36:32.030 --> 1:36:34.120
That's not normally
the way lawyers' fees
are delivered, is it?

1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:36.740
Look,
l have made statements
to this effect before.

1:36:36.830 --> 1:36:39.000
All that was Haldeman
and Ehrlichman's business.

1:36:39.080 --> 1:36:41.210
l knew nothing.
Okay, fine. Fine!

1:36:41.290 --> 1:36:42.580
You made a conclusion there.

1:36:42.670 --> 1:36:44.250
l stated my view,
now let's move on.

1:36:44.340 --> 1:36:45.420
Let's get on to
the rest of it.

1:36:45.500 --> 1:36:46.500
No, hold on.
No, hold on.

1:36:46.590 --> 1:36:47.590
No, l don't
want to talk. . .

1:36:47.670 --> 1:36:49.380
lf Haldeman and Ehrlichman
were the ones
really responsible,

1:36:49.470 --> 1:36:52.260
when you subsequently
found out about it,

1:36:52.340 --> 1:36:54.390
why didn't you
call the police
and have them arrested?

1:36:54.470 --> 1:36:56.470
lsn't that just
a cover-up of another kind?

1:36:56.560 --> 1:36:58.220
Yeah, maybe l should
have done that.
Maybe l should have.

1:36:58.310 --> 1:37:00.060
Just called the feds
into my office

1:37:00.140 --> 1:37:02.270
and said, "Hey,
there's the two men.

1:37:02.350 --> 1:37:03.810
"Haul them
down to the dock,

1:37:03.900 --> 1:37:05.980
"fingerprint them
and then throw them
in the can."

1:37:06.070 --> 1:37:07.150
l'm not made that way.

1:37:07.230 --> 1:37:10.240
These men,
Haldeman, Ehrlichman,
l knew their families.

1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:12.150
l knew them since
they were just kids.

1:37:12.240 --> 1:37:13.530
Yeah, but you know,
politically,

1:37:13.610 --> 1:37:16.490
the pressure on me
to let them go,
that became overwhelming !

1:37:16.580 --> 1:37:19.410
So l did it.
l cut off one arm,

1:37:19.500 --> 1:37:22.210
then l cut off the other,
and l'm not a good butcher!

1:37:22.290 --> 1:37:25.170
And l have always maintained
what they were doing,

1:37:25.250 --> 1:37:27.500
what we were all doing,
was not criminal.

1:37:27.590 --> 1:37:29.130
Look,
when you're in office,

1:37:29.210 --> 1:37:32.470
you gotta do
a lot of things sometimes
that are not always,

1:37:32.550 --> 1:37:36.090
in the strictest sense
of the law, legal,
but you do them

1:37:36.180 --> 1:37:38.390
because they're in
the greater interests
of the nation !

1:37:38.470 --> 1:37:40.180
Right. Wait, just so
l understand correctly,

1:37:40.270 --> 1:37:42.980
are you really saying
that in certain situations,

1:37:43.060 --> 1:37:46.020
the President can decide
whether it's in the best
interests of the nation

1:37:46.110 --> 1:37:48.190
and then do something illegal?

1:37:48.270 --> 1:37:53.150
l'm saying that when
the President does it,
that means it's not illegal.

1:37:55.530 --> 1:37:56.990
l'm sorry?

1:37:57.070 --> 1:37:58.950
That's what l believe.

1:37:59.910 --> 1:38:01.330
Oh, my God.

1:38:06.290 --> 1:38:11.170
But l realize
no one else
shares that view.

1:38:13.260 --> 1:38:18.260
So, in that case,
will you accept, then,

1:38:18.470 --> 1:38:20.970
to clear the air
once and for all,

1:38:21.470 --> 1:38:23.640
that you were part
of a cover-up

1:38:23.730 --> 1:38:27.150
and that you did
break the law?

if you were going
to make some kind of
emotional disclosure,

1:40:00.070 --> 1:40:03.280

the period
March 21 to April 30,

1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:35.810
and the mistakes
you made, and so on,
and l was wondering

1:42:38.110 --> 1:42:41.570
would you go
further than "mistakes"?

1:42:41.650 --> 1:42:45.400
The word that
seems not enough
for people to understand.

1:42:47.700 --> 1:42:50.620

would you express?

Since you've asked me,
l think there
are three things

1:43:10.510 --> 1:43:13.600
that people would
like to hear you say.

1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:18.100
One, that there was
probably more than mistakes.

1:43:18.190 --> 1:43:21.110
There was wrongdoing.

1:43:21.190 --> 1:43:24.030
And, yes, it might
have been a crime, too.

1:43:25.320 --> 1:43:30.620
Secondly, that "l did
abuse the power
l had as President."

1:43:32.370 --> 1:43:35.240
And thirdly,
"l put the American people

1:43:35.330 --> 1:43:38.160
"through two years
of needless agony,

1:43:39.120 --> 1:43:42.750
"and l apologize for that."
And l know
how difficult it is

1:43:43.170 --> 1:43:46.460
for anyone, especially you,

1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:51.720
but l think the people
need to hear it.

1:43:51.800 --> 1:43:54.640
And l think that
unless you say it,

1:43:55.810 --> 1:43:59.270
you're going to be haunted
for the rest of your life.

1:44:03.070 --> 1:44:09.070
Well, it's true.
l made mistakes,
horrendous ones,

1:44:10.820 --> 1:44:14.120
ones that were not
worthy of a president,

1:44:16.120 --> 1:44:19.000
ones that did not
meet the standards
of excellence

1:44:19.080 --> 1:44:22.880
that l always dreamed of
as a young boy.

1:44:22.960 --> 1:44:28.630
But, if you remember,
it was a difficult time.

1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:33.680
l was caught up
in a five-front war

1:44:34.180 --> 1:44:37.850
against a partisan media,
a partisan House of Congress,

1:44:37.930 --> 1:44:40.640
a partisan Ervin Committee.

1:44:42.150 --> 1:44:45.900
But, yes, l will admit
there were times

1:44:45.980 --> 1:44:49.110
l did not fully meet
that responsibility

1:44:49.190 --> 1:44:53.990
and l was involved
in a cover-up,
as you call it.

1:44:54.660 --> 1:44:58.660
And for all those mistakes
l have a very deep regret.

1:45:02.420 --> 1:45:06.170
No one can know
what it's like to resign
the presidency.

1:45:16.890 --> 1:45:19.390
No! Never!

1:45:21.060 --> 1:45:23.440
l still insist they were
mistakes of the heart.

1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:25.060
They were not
mistakes of the head.

1:45:25.150 --> 1:45:28.860

l don't blame anybody.

and they stuck it in,

1:45:38.910 --> 1:45:42.540
and they twisted it
with relish.

1:45:43.540 --> 1:45:47.790
And l guess if l'd
been in their place,
l'd have done the same thing.

1:45:48.090 --> 1:45:50.500
And the American people?

1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:11.230
l let them down.

1:46:13.860 --> 1:46:16.110
l let down my friends.

1:46:18.950 --> 1:46:23.660
l let down the country.

1:46:27.540 --> 1:46:29.210
And worst of all,

1:46:32.710 --> 1:46:35.510
l let down
our system of government.

You know, the first
and greatest sin
or deception of television

1:47:54.500 --> 1:47:57.970
is that it simplifies,
it diminishes,

1:47:58.260 --> 1:48:02.720
great, complex ideas,
tranches of time.

1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:07.730

to a single snapshot.

1:48:08.730 --> 1:48:10.900
At first, l couldn't
understand why

1:48:10.980 --> 1:48:13.310
Bob Zelnick was
quite as euphoric

1:48:13.400 --> 1:48:15.610
as he was after
the interviews,

1:48:18.450 --> 1:48:22.200
or why John Birt felt
moved to strip naked

1:48:22.280 --> 1:48:25.160
and rush into
the ocean to celebrate.

1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:29.910
But that was before
l really understood

1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.790
the reductive power
of the close-up.

succeeded on that final day

swollen and ravaged
by loneliness,
self-loathing and defeat.

not only be forgotten,
