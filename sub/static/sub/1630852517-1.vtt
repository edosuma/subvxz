01:34.268 --> 01:36.444
Oh, no.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.855
-Cigar?
-No, thank you.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.379
Perhaps wine?

01:58.422 --> 02:01.208
I have one of the finest
collections in all of Colombia.

02:04.341 --> 02:05.734
Okay.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.824
So...

02:11.174 --> 02:12.915
...let's do business.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.224
Jeronimo.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.095
My son.

02:19.878 --> 02:23.360
He convinced me
this is the new drug.

02:23.404 --> 02:24.883
Technology.

02:25.667 --> 02:29.149
[over radio]: Faster to grow

02:29.192 --> 02:33.892
So, this device
can access anything on the net.

02:33.936 --> 02:38.462
Targeted power kills,

You're gonna love this.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.572
Okay, three o'clock
from your position.

03:01.616 --> 03:04.358
Okay.

03:04.401 --> 03:05.924

03:05.968 --> 03:08.100

-You see it.

03:49.359 --> 03:50.969
This is just a taste.

03:51.013 --> 03:54.712
Like we used to... to give
a lick of the coca. Hmm?

03:55.626 --> 03:56.975
And it's the only one, you say?

03:57.019 --> 04:01.284
Try and make a copy,
it deletes itself.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.112
I'm the only one
who can make it.

04:03.155 --> 04:04.983
So...

04:05.027 --> 04:06.855
do we have a deal?

04:07.856 --> 04:09.640
Yeah.

04:09.684 --> 04:11.338
Yeah, I think we probably do.

06:23.295 --> 06:24.427
Come.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.865
We got incoming from
the Colombian operative.

06:27.909 --> 06:30.477
He, uh...
he sounds pretty spooked.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.696
Now, he says he's got something
to sell, something that would,

06:32.740 --> 06:34.437
uh, rattle our friends
at the NSA.

06:34.481 --> 06:37.875
He's asking for three million,
cash, so he can disappear.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.574
Did he contact
any other agencies?

06:40.617 --> 06:42.140
He doesn't seem
too patient, sir.

06:42.184 --> 06:43.403
That's a yes.

06:43.446 --> 06:44.795
And the Colombians,

06:44.839 --> 06:46.362
-they're coming for him, too.
-Where is he now?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.798
On his way to Paris.

06:51.019 --> 06:54.109

07:02.422 --> 07:03.988
[grunting continues]

07:08.515 --> 07:10.168
Come on.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.478
No close contact, huh?

07:15.522 --> 07:17.306
[panting]

07:17.349 --> 07:19.221
They get close, they get hurt.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.963
Yeah, you fight like you date.

07:22.006 --> 07:24.748
Oh, you want to talk about
your dating history, big guy?

07:24.792 --> 07:26.533
Another time.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.666
You got a job.

Exposure's 360 degrees.
We can't box him in.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.225
No need. He called us.

08:07.269 --> 08:08.749
We trade bags, walk away.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.054
No muss, no fuss.

08:10.098 --> 08:11.534
Why don't we have
a team on this?

08:11.578 --> 08:13.057
It's a simple drop, Mace.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.494
He could've sold that thing
on the black market

08:14.537 --> 08:16.278
for a lot more,
but he just wants three mil

08:16.321 --> 08:17.845
for him and his family
to disappear.

08:17.888 --> 08:20.848
-What a guy.
-You ever consider it?

08:20.891 --> 08:23.546
What? Committing high treason
or starting a family?

08:23.590 --> 08:25.243
Take your pick.

08:25.287 --> 08:26.636
No.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.072
I haven't.

08:28.116 --> 08:30.858
[sighs]
'Cause you love the job.

One of us has to.

the idea of family,

you're really gonna love
our cover.

No.

08:45.263 --> 08:48.136
-On our honeymoon.
-Our honeymoon?

08:48.179 --> 08:49.746
Yeah.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.487
So you crafted this cover?

08:51.531 --> 08:55.360
You wanted me to do more work,
sweetheart.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.580
Try the ring.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.626
See if it fits.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.545
Hmm, it'll do.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.155
Great.

09:08.156 --> 09:10.898
Okay, so, uh, that's
our best access point, huh?

09:10.941 --> 09:12.682
Straight line to the drop.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.336
I'll run lead.

09:17.339 --> 09:19.471
You do know
what honeymooners do, right?

09:19.515 --> 09:21.038
When they're on their honeymoon,

09:21.082 --> 09:23.998
in the most romantic city
in the world, Ethel?

09:24.041 --> 09:25.477
You call me Ethel again,

09:25.521 --> 09:27.262
you're gonna wish
you got me a smaller ring.

09:27.305 --> 09:29.830
-I want to try something.
-[sighs]

09:29.873 --> 09:31.701
No, Nick,
there's no other angles here.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.311
I'm not talking about the job.

09:45.889 --> 09:48.326

What are you doing?

10:16.920 --> 10:18.879
You're my best friend.

10:20.837 --> 10:23.057
I don't have anybody else.

10:24.319 --> 10:25.973
I know.

10:28.671 --> 10:31.195
And I don't want
to mess this up.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.768
Tell me you never
thought about it.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.097
Come here.

11:29.123 --> 11:30.907
It's a little cliché, no?

11:30.951 --> 11:32.779
-What?
-Honeymoon in Paris.

11:32.822 --> 11:36.086
Just 'cause it's cliché
doesn't mean it's not romantic.

11:36.130 --> 11:39.437
Well, that depends
on your definition of romance.

11:39.481 --> 11:42.092
I like the way
that ring looks on you.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.574
That's the spot.

11:45.617 --> 11:48.490
You get us a table.
I'll check out the inside.

11:51.014 --> 11:53.451
Sorry, is this seat taken?

stay away from the Left Bank.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.832
Oh, no, we can't skip that.
We're on our honeymoon.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.922
You should have the eggs.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.575
But don't salt them.

Of course.

This isn't exactly
regular hours.

No, it's not.

what you're talking about.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.073
They didn't fly me
halfway around the world

19:22.117 --> 19:23.336
for a therapy session.

19:23.379 --> 19:26.382
I never knew
you worked in the field.

19:26.426 --> 19:28.210
No, I never did.

19:28.254 --> 19:29.646
Till now.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.869
They sent you here because
they thought I would trust you.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.351
Right?

19:38.394 --> 19:40.875
That I would give you
my secrets.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.357
Do you have secrets?

19:45.184 --> 19:46.750
[chuckles softly]

19:50.145 --> 19:52.278
I thought you said
you weren't here for therapy.

19:53.104 --> 19:55.106
I'm not.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.543
I'm here to help you.

19:57.326 --> 20:00.808
I'm the only one in the Agency
who really knows you.

20:37.366 --> 20:38.628
Uh, okay.

21:57.098 --> 21:59.143
You lost
three million dollars of

21:59.187 --> 22:01.102
-the Agency's money. -Hey, hey,
this isn't an inquisition.

22:01.145 --> 22:05.367
We're just making sure we have
all the facts for the report.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.848
We lost the package, right?

22:07.891 --> 22:10.416
What did Nick say?
He's been off comms.

22:16.291 --> 22:17.640
Just tell me.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.034
Nick didn't make it.

22:20.077 --> 22:24.081
He was shot
going after the mark.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.649
I I.D.'d his body myself.

22:27.781 --> 22:29.478
-I need some water.
-He can get it.

22:29.522 --> 22:30.784
I can get it.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.846
Do you like it?

22:50.630 --> 22:52.545
Or is it too much?

22:53.981 --> 22:56.549
It's a bit much.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.768
I like it.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.641
I like it, too.

23:11.868 --> 23:14.393
So, it's still out there.

23:14.436 --> 23:15.611
We have some leads.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.483
-I can find it.
-[chuckles]

23:17.526 --> 23:18.919
-You're in no shape to...
-I'm fine.

23:18.962 --> 23:20.442
-You're the one who lost it.
-Fuck you, Grady.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.704
-[laughs]
-Dial it down.

23:21.748 --> 23:24.011
-This is my...
-I said dial it down.

23:25.795 --> 23:27.884
Give us the room.

23:31.061 --> 23:32.280
[Grady scoffs]

23:34.369 --> 23:35.805
And turn that thing off.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.807
This is my op.
You give it away...

23:37.851 --> 23:41.158
The little red light
has to go off.

23:49.863 --> 23:52.605
Officially,
I can't put you on this.

23:52.648 --> 23:56.957
I said it's not an inquisition,
but there is an investigation.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.264
But if you were
to go out on your own,

24:00.308 --> 24:05.008
decided you needed to avenge
the death of your teammate...

24:06.183 --> 24:09.230
...I could understand
how that might happen.

24:10.361 --> 24:11.972
I would need some help.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.802
It has become undeniable,

24:15.845 --> 24:17.238
from the Shadow Brokers

24:17.281 --> 24:18.892
and the Vault 7 leaks

24:18.935 --> 24:21.938
to new exploits being developed
every day on the dark net,

24:21.982 --> 24:25.028
that we need a new solution
in cybersecurity,

24:25.072 --> 24:27.161
one that can predict
and intercept

24:27.204 --> 24:30.033
possible cyber threats
passing through any of

24:30.077 --> 24:32.862
the 43 access points
that control Internet traffic,

24:32.906 --> 24:35.125
lawfully screen and catalog them

24:35.169 --> 24:37.519
to create an adaptive database.

24:37.563 --> 24:42.132
Think of it as a Dewey decimal
system for cyberattacks.

24:46.441 --> 24:49.879
I know this may seem
far removed from everyday life,

24:49.923 --> 24:53.187
but not when you take
a closer look at reality.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.232
Hey.

24:55.276 --> 24:56.886
Dij.

24:56.930 --> 24:58.888
I'm guessing
this isn't a social call.

24:58.932 --> 25:01.369
-Ah, and straight to the point.
-So get to it.

25:01.412 --> 25:03.284
There's a package--
odds are it's still in Paris,

25:03.327 --> 25:05.329
but I don't know for sure.
We need to retrieve it.

25:05.373 --> 25:06.548
"We"?

25:06.592 --> 25:07.593
[laughs]:
I haven't the faintest idea

25:07.636 --> 25:08.898
what you're talking about.

25:08.942 --> 25:10.726
MI6 does,
but this can't be official.

25:10.770 --> 25:13.033
-I'm out on my own now.
-Yes, you are.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.556
I'm not in the field anymore.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.950
-I'm done with that life.
-Everyone always says that.

25:16.993 --> 25:18.778
I say it because it's true.

25:18.821 --> 25:20.083
Who's that?

25:20.127 --> 25:21.563
I'm sorry you came all this way.

25:21.607 --> 25:22.956
Who is that?

25:22.999 --> 25:25.698
-My partner.
-Partner in the sense of...

25:25.741 --> 25:28.831
-You're my friend from America.
-I am your friend from America.

25:28.875 --> 25:31.442
-Hi.
-Hi.

25:31.486 --> 25:32.748
I was talking to some investors.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.576
-They were impressed.
-So was I.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.056
Abdel, this is my friend Mace.

25:36.099 --> 25:37.666
-From America.
-Just passing through.

25:37.710 --> 25:38.928
On her way to Paris.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.408
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

25:40.451 --> 25:42.018
I haven't met
many of Khadijah's friends.

25:42.062 --> 25:43.803
-No?
-Shame you can't stay.

25:43.846 --> 25:46.632
-Well...
-Yes, yes, it is a shame.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.112
Until next time.

25:49.156 --> 25:51.288
It was good to see you again,
Khadijah.

25:51.332 --> 25:52.681
I've missed you.

25:52.725 --> 25:54.117
Safe travels.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.380
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

25:57.468 --> 25:59.645
Until next time.

26:08.044 --> 26:10.351
Hope you don't mind.
I let myself in.

26:10.394 --> 26:13.354
Getting into the room
isn't the same as getting in.

26:14.181 --> 26:15.965
You didn't ask the question.

26:16.009 --> 26:17.532
And you didn't ask
the question because

26:17.576 --> 26:19.534
-you don't want to know
the answer. -Correct.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.753
The package is...

26:20.796 --> 26:22.929
-Here we go.
-...a data key--

26:22.972 --> 26:24.539
a set of cyber tools,
exploit kits,

26:24.583 --> 26:26.062
worms, ransomware, you name it--

26:26.106 --> 26:28.804
that can get into any
closed system on the planet.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.850
This suite of tools
is still out there,

26:30.893 --> 26:32.329
and I need your help
to track it down.

26:32.373 --> 26:35.506
-I haven't heard...
-[phone ringing]

26:35.550 --> 26:36.638
I need to take this.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.335
They killed Nick.

26:49.825 --> 26:52.132
[sighs]

26:52.175 --> 26:54.656
You know those-- the old wars?

26:54.700 --> 26:57.528
Cold War, War on Terror.

26:57.572 --> 26:58.834
We knew who we were fighting.

26:58.878 --> 27:01.445
But now the enemy's invisible.

27:01.489 --> 27:03.709
Like ghosts in a machine.

27:05.145 --> 27:06.712
If they get their hands on this,

27:06.755 --> 27:09.671
they could control and
destabilize entire city grids,

27:09.715 --> 27:13.544
nuclear facilities,
world markets,

27:13.588 --> 27:15.677
anything from a plane in the sky

27:15.721 --> 27:17.810
to the phone in your pocket.

27:17.853 --> 27:19.246
You know the kind of people

27:19.289 --> 27:20.943
who'll be gunning
to get ahold of this.

27:20.987 --> 27:23.380
And you know
what they'll do with it.

27:23.424 --> 27:25.992
They can control
any part of the world

27:26.035 --> 27:27.515
from the simple reach
of their keyboard.

27:27.558 --> 27:29.909
Everything you said
on that stage was right.

27:29.952 --> 27:31.911
Everything except one thing.

27:33.129 --> 27:34.783
The threat isn't on the horizon.

27:34.827 --> 27:37.264
It's here. Right now.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.660
They get this,
they start World War III.

27:42.443 --> 27:46.316
The war would be over before
we could even fight back.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.363
I cannot do this
without you, Dij.

27:50.277 --> 27:52.627
You're the best in the world
at what you do.

27:57.937 --> 28:01.767
- Southwest corner,
around- 35 a.m.

28:04.944 --> 28:06.249
That's her.

28:06.293 --> 28:07.990
Yep, she's the one
who blew the op.

28:08.034 --> 28:10.601
Can you find her,
figure out who she is?

28:10.645 --> 28:12.386
[typing]

28:13.692 --> 28:15.128
Marie Schmidt.

28:15.171 --> 28:16.651
Agent with the BND.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.087
-What?
-Demolitions,

28:18.131 --> 28:20.089
disobedience, demotions.

28:20.133 --> 28:23.745
Uh, always under suspicion
of being a double agent.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.747
Why?

28:25.791 --> 28:27.270
Her father.

28:27.314 --> 28:30.273
Sold secrets to the Russians
in the early '90s.

28:30.317 --> 28:32.798
Got caught
when she was very young.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.147
Hmm, looks like
it runs in the family.

28:34.190 --> 28:36.149
She was working with this guy.

28:36.192 --> 28:37.585
Any known associates
or contacts?

28:37.628 --> 28:39.456
One second.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.893
Nothing.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.938
-What do you mean nothing?
-Nothing.

28:42.982 --> 28:46.028
No partner, no husband,

28:46.072 --> 28:48.639
boyfriend, girlfriend,
kids, pets.

28:48.683 --> 28:49.858
Literally nothing.

28:49.902 --> 28:52.513
-She works alone.
-[typing]

28:52.556 --> 28:53.906
Lives alone.

28:53.949 --> 28:55.777
I'm not even finding
a personal email address.

28:55.821 --> 28:58.824
Hey, stay on him.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.351
How'd he get the drive
in the first place?

29:04.394 --> 29:06.135
Hmm, grabbed it
in a cartel raid.

29:06.179 --> 29:07.920
Idiot didn't even know
what he had.

29:07.963 --> 29:10.226
He tried to sell it
for a lousy three mil.

29:10.270 --> 29:12.533
[typing]

29:12.576 --> 29:15.231
Can you get
another angle in here?

29:16.015 --> 29:17.233
It's a blind spot.

29:17.277 --> 29:18.713
Can you get
a satellite or something

29:18.757 --> 29:21.368
-so we can see in there?
-The definition of "blind"

29:21.411 --> 29:22.630
is "can't see."

29:25.851 --> 29:28.070
They knew exactly
where to hit him.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.249
Are you okay?

29:34.773 --> 29:36.339
Yeah.

29:39.386 --> 29:41.649
Stay on him.
He's the one with the drive.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.177
He's still in Paris.

29:48.221 --> 29:50.876
-He is?
-Registered under Luis Gonzales

29:50.919 --> 29:52.529
at the Hotel Paradis.

29:52.573 --> 29:53.835
The program will process

29:53.879 --> 29:55.750
his features through
every camera in the city.

29:55.794 --> 29:59.058
We can find out where he's been
and track where he's going.

29:59.101 --> 30:01.364
There's a tech conference
in Paris.

30:01.408 --> 30:04.193
They had a speaker drop out
at the last second.

30:04.237 --> 30:05.891
You sure you don't want company?

30:05.934 --> 30:08.023
I'll be back
for dinner tomorrow.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.858
You're gonna need these

30:16.902 --> 30:19.295
if you're going back
into the field.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.692
-I thought this was done.
-So did I.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.567
Dinner.

30:30.611 --> 30:31.786
Tomorrow.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.570
Be safe out there, okay?

31:36.024 --> 31:38.331

32:33.995 --> 32:37.172
There he is. Eleven o'clock,
turning the corner.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.176
Will you be
on the plane with me?

32:41.220 --> 32:43.135
We go together.

32:43.962 --> 32:47.052
I'll take out the guards.
You stay on the bag.

32:48.227 --> 32:49.532
They're deploying,
forming a perimeter,

32:49.576 --> 32:51.186
trying to ferret out
surveillance.

32:51.230 --> 32:53.536
-We need a diversion.
-I think we have one.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.078
Looks like she's armed.

33:13.121 --> 33:14.514
[over earpiece]:
Closing in on the target.

33:14.557 --> 33:15.950
I'll take care of her.
You monitor the bag.

41:47.766 --> 41:49.202
I'm an agent just like you.

41:49.245 --> 41:51.421
I'm not an agent.
I'm a psychologist.

41:51.465 --> 41:54.207
I was sent here
to analyze one of our agents.

41:54.250 --> 41:55.730
What about the men
you were with?

41:55.774 --> 41:57.340
Did you analyze them?

41:57.384 --> 42:00.909
I was doing what I was told
to do by my agency.

42:00.953 --> 42:02.868
Do you think I knew

42:02.911 --> 42:05.087
they would turn around
and try to shoot me?

42:07.176 --> 42:08.874
-Hands! -You have ten seconds
to put your gun down!

42:08.917 --> 42:10.571
-Mace.
-You have a new partner.

42:10.615 --> 42:13.095
-You got the last one killed.
-What are you talking about?

42:13.139 --> 42:14.575
You're working with
the Colombian?

42:14.619 --> 42:16.577
You Americans are so stupid.
Nine.

42:16.621 --> 42:18.187
She was not working with him.

42:18.231 --> 42:20.755
-Please put the guns down.
-I would listen to her.

42:20.799 --> 42:23.410
-Then by all means do.
-Eight. Seven.

42:23.453 --> 42:25.630
-We all want the
same thing here. -No, we don't.

42:25.673 --> 42:27.327
-Six.
-Please.

42:27.370 --> 42:28.458
-Five.
-Four.

42:28.502 --> 42:30.417
-Three. -Two.
-One!

42:33.855 --> 42:36.249
Go on. Go ahead.

42:36.292 --> 42:38.773
Pull the trigger.
Kill each other.

42:38.817 --> 42:40.166
Listen, I get it.

42:40.209 --> 42:41.646
You keep botching
each other's ops.

42:41.689 --> 42:43.648
I'd be pissed off, too,
but the only way

42:43.691 --> 42:46.433
we are gonna accomplish
anything is if we join forces.

42:46.476 --> 42:47.695
Are you crazy?

42:47.739 --> 42:49.784
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

42:51.133 --> 42:53.092
We have a common enemy.

42:54.354 --> 42:56.965
I'm just suggesting
you lower the guns long enough

42:57.009 --> 42:58.793
for us to sort this out
and get on with it.

42:58.837 --> 43:00.490
Who are you?

43:00.534 --> 43:03.276
Khadijah. MI6.

43:07.759 --> 43:09.587
Marie, you've met Mace.

43:09.630 --> 43:11.937
-How do you know my name?
-We're spies, asshole.

43:11.980 --> 43:14.156
I'm cyber intelligence.

43:15.505 --> 43:16.724
Graciela.

43:16.768 --> 43:17.986
That's how you pronounce it,
right?

43:18.030 --> 43:20.206
Look, what happened
to you out there,

43:20.249 --> 43:21.381
it's terrible.

43:23.209 --> 43:24.558
What do you know
about the drive?

43:24.602 --> 43:26.255
She knows nothing about this.

43:26.299 --> 43:27.996
Well...

43:28.040 --> 43:30.259
that is not entirely true.

43:30.303 --> 43:33.785
-What?
-Luis put a tracker on it.

43:33.828 --> 43:35.177
It's linked to his cell phone.

43:35.221 --> 43:37.484
Hey! Slow.

43:37.527 --> 43:38.833
-Go ahead.
-How come you didn't tell me

43:38.877 --> 43:40.182
anything about this before?

43:40.226 --> 43:41.749
I didn't know
if I could trust you.

43:41.793 --> 43:45.666
-And now you do?
-No, but I had no choice,

43:45.710 --> 43:47.320
and I can't do this myself.

43:47.363 --> 43:49.931
-It's encrypted.
-No, no, it works.

43:54.066 --> 43:56.764
He installed a fail-safe
to your fingerprint.

43:56.808 --> 43:58.070
I can't breach that.

43:58.113 --> 43:59.375
The drive's on the move.

43:59.419 --> 44:02.683
Headed southeast
over the Atlantic.

44:02.727 --> 44:04.554
-Middle East?
-Due south.

44:04.598 --> 44:06.687
Africa. Let me check.

44:06.731 --> 44:08.210
Flight plans.

44:08.254 --> 44:09.647
Morocco.

44:09.690 --> 44:11.910
-Come on, let's go.
-Oh, no.

44:11.953 --> 44:14.347
I'm not going with you.
I'm going home.

44:14.390 --> 44:15.696
But we can't do this
without your fingerprints.

44:15.740 --> 44:17.393
That is not my problem.

44:17.437 --> 44:19.744
Oh, it is if you want to keep
them attached to your body.

44:19.787 --> 44:21.659
I'm sorry. I have a family.

44:21.702 --> 44:23.399
I'm not an agent.
I'm a therapist.

44:23.443 --> 44:26.315
-And this is really not for me.
-All right, Graciela.

44:26.359 --> 44:28.143
You know what else
may not be for you?

44:28.187 --> 44:30.842
Is explaining to your kids
why the whole world is on fire

44:30.885 --> 44:32.844
because the bad guys got ahold
of the device before we did.

44:32.887 --> 44:36.717
We're the only ones who can
prevent that from happening.

44:36.761 --> 44:38.501
-Sorry.
-Okay, how 'bout this?

44:38.545 --> 44:41.722
Those same guys are out there
right now looking for you.

44:41.766 --> 44:44.986
You go home,
you bring them with you.

44:45.030 --> 44:46.422
Graciela,
we really need your help.

44:46.466 --> 44:50.383
But more importantly,
you need ours.

44:56.650 --> 45:00.132
Okay. I'm gonna need to make
another phone call.

45:01.133 --> 45:03.352
And I'm gonna need a new shirt.

45:04.353 --> 45:05.572
Burners.

45:06.573 --> 45:07.705
From now on.

45:07.748 --> 45:10.490
No, I won't be home for dinner.

45:11.317 --> 45:13.275
Just a little longer, babes.

45:13.319 --> 45:15.016
[sighs]

45:15.060 --> 45:16.452
No one to call?

45:17.236 --> 45:19.325
You got him killed when
you blew the op at the café.

45:19.368 --> 45:22.807
Yeah.
That's the thing with partners.

45:22.850 --> 45:24.286
They get killed.

45:27.333 --> 45:29.117
Or they kill you.

45:30.205 --> 45:32.251
Is that some kind of threat?

45:33.905 --> 45:35.341
Yes.

45:36.342 --> 45:38.344
Yes, it is.

45:40.259 --> 45:42.435
Yes, I'm safe.

45:42.478 --> 45:43.784
Look, I have to go.

45:43.828 --> 45:46.091
Talk to you later. Bye.

45:47.962 --> 45:49.877
You lie to protect him?

45:53.533 --> 45:55.100
You have children?

45:55.883 --> 45:57.189
No.

He's clean.

46:24.390 --> 46:26.348
I'm not picking up any tails.

46:26.392 --> 46:27.567
I'm on him.

46:28.176 --> 46:29.699
We know he's armed.

46:29.743 --> 46:31.963
He doesn't care about
disturbing the crowd.

46:32.006 --> 46:34.313
I really shouldn't be here
for this part.

46:34.356 --> 46:37.403
You just handle the phone.
I'll handle the guns.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.929
[sighs] Ay.

46:41.973 --> 46:43.626
-I'm scared.
-Good.

boxed in from both sides.

46:57.902 --> 46:59.468
You have direct angles to him.

47:00.556 --> 47:02.558
You've got a window.
Good to move in.

47:04.909 --> 47:07.389
He's reaching for something.

47:07.433 --> 47:08.434
Dij?

47:12.786 --> 47:15.920
Was that a brush-past?
Dij, you get that?

47:15.963 --> 47:17.443
One sec. Let me look.

47:17.486 --> 47:19.880
Our targets are heading
in opposite directions.

47:19.924 --> 47:21.577
I'm not
going to risk losing him.

47:21.621 --> 47:23.884
-We need to split up.
-Fine. You take the courier.

47:23.928 --> 47:25.581
Let's go.

47:25.625 --> 47:27.888
I have eyes on the new player.

47:27.932 --> 47:30.282
I'll stay on him.
Dij, how you doing?

47:31.283 --> 47:32.893
Still confirming the handoff.

47:32.937 --> 47:34.895

[knives stabbing]

48:03.881 --> 48:04.969
Affirmative.

48:05.012 --> 48:06.535
He made a handoff.

48:09.321 --> 48:11.671
[over earpiece]:
Mace, your man has the drive.

48:17.459 --> 48:19.113
Four killers on the move.

48:28.470 --> 48:30.516
They're going after the drive.
We've got competition.

48:30.559 --> 48:31.996
Take this.

48:32.039 --> 48:33.649
-Take it. -You said I didn't
have to do the gun stuff.

48:33.693 --> 48:36.565
It changed. The plan changed.
Take it.

48:45.357 --> 48:48.055
Dij, get me a visual
on the building.

48:50.275 --> 48:51.841
It's a hammam.

48:51.885 --> 48:53.887
Perfect. I'll take him
in there, away from the crowd.

48:54.627 --> 48:57.760
How's a white woman
gonna get in there unnoticed?

48:57.804 --> 48:59.284
It's a men-only hammam.

48:59.327 --> 49:01.590
I'm on my way.

49:07.248 --> 49:08.684
Hey. You're not
going in there alone.

49:08.728 --> 49:10.556
And you're not
going there at all.

49:13.167 --> 49:14.473
The last time
you went into an op alone...

49:14.516 --> 49:16.170
Was the last time
I was in the field.

49:16.214 --> 49:17.476
Yes, I know.

49:17.519 --> 49:19.347
There's no other play here,
Mace.

49:20.131 --> 49:21.741
How do I look?

54:18.559 --> 54:19.821
You don't want to hear about it.

54:19.865 --> 54:21.475
You definitely want
to hear about it.

54:21.519 --> 54:22.998
[sighs]

54:23.912 --> 54:25.305
Tell us.

54:25.349 --> 54:26.828
-Okay.
-[Mace chuckles]

54:26.872 --> 54:29.657
I was tracing intel on a phone,

54:29.701 --> 54:32.834
and I geolocated it to a
detention site in Afghanistan,

54:32.878 --> 54:34.706
which didn't make any sense

54:34.749 --> 54:38.492
because they don't exactly
allow phones in there, so...

54:38.536 --> 54:40.842
But there was this one gentleman

54:40.886 --> 54:45.717
who had hidden it
in a secure location.

54:50.069 --> 54:51.940
-In his...?
-Up his bum.

54:51.984 --> 54:53.333
-[laughter]
-No way.

54:53.377 --> 54:55.117
-All the way up there.

54:55.161 --> 54:57.555
I'll never forget it.
Nokia 8850.

54:57.598 --> 54:58.686
Long and slim.

54:58.730 --> 55:00.035
You cannot imagine

55:00.079 --> 55:02.081
the stench that emanated
from that chipset.

55:02.124 --> 55:03.648
[laughs]

55:03.691 --> 55:05.389
I've been attached to
my hand sanitizer ever since.

55:05.432 --> 55:07.042
[laughs] Okay, I'm done eating.

55:07.086 --> 55:09.828
Hey, what about you?
When was your first?

55:11.569 --> 55:12.831
[sighs]

55:12.874 --> 55:14.789
Come on, now.
We showed you ours.

55:14.833 --> 55:18.402
Name, age, nationality.

55:20.752 --> 55:22.275
[clears throat] Walter.

55:23.102 --> 55:26.453
He was German,
and, um, I was 15.

55:27.280 --> 55:28.673
You were 15?

55:30.414 --> 55:32.546
I came down the stairs
from my room,

55:32.590 --> 55:36.071
and I heard my father
speak Russian.

55:36.115 --> 55:38.944
I never knew
he could speak Russian.

55:38.987 --> 55:42.774
I didn't know those men were
KGB, but I knew they were bad.

55:45.254 --> 55:48.736
He was washing blood
off his hands, and, um...

55:48.780 --> 55:50.651
there was a body on the floor.

55:53.611 --> 55:55.787
So you turned in
your own father?

55:55.830 --> 55:57.049
Yep.

55:59.617 --> 56:01.401
Are you in therapy?

56:01.445 --> 56:02.924
Hmm.

56:02.968 --> 56:04.099
I should be.

56:04.143 --> 56:05.710
Yeah.

56:05.753 --> 56:07.451
I think, I think you should.

56:07.494 --> 56:09.757
I know this is no consolation,

56:09.801 --> 56:12.281
but I just have to say
that you are,

56:12.325 --> 56:14.458
without a doubt...

56:15.415 --> 56:16.764
...the most...

56:18.853 --> 56:20.289
...screwed-up of us all.

56:20.333 --> 56:21.552
[laughter]

56:21.595 --> 56:23.292
[laughs]:
Yes.

56:23.336 --> 56:24.685
True.

56:24.729 --> 56:26.644
Cheers to that.

56:27.645 --> 56:29.429
Oh, no. We need another round.

56:29.473 --> 56:31.257
Or like ten. All for you.

56:31.300 --> 56:32.606
Thanks.

57:03.376 --> 57:04.769
I'm not here for you.

57:07.728 --> 57:09.251
Can you turn that up?

57:09.295 --> 57:11.123
-[TV volume increases]
-Air towers have

57:11.166 --> 57:14.735
multiple fail-safes,
backup power sources,

57:14.779 --> 57:17.477
so the FAA is investigating
what went wrong.

57:17.521 --> 57:18.870
Even with the power outage

57:18.913 --> 57:21.394
-to the whole of the city
of Lisbon... -Dij.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.483
...there should have
been redundancies to prevent

57:23.527 --> 57:24.789
this kind of malfunction.

57:24.832 --> 57:26.312
All planes experienced
the outage

57:26.355 --> 57:27.356
that caused them to crash.

57:27.400 --> 57:28.706
Phone.

57:28.749 --> 57:30.447
Officials have
yet to make a statement,

57:30.490 --> 57:33.580
but many believe this may have
been a terrorist attack.

57:33.624 --> 57:36.017
So, six passenger planes so far

57:36.061 --> 57:39.760
and two more still missing
we've yet to locate.

57:39.804 --> 57:41.066

Shit.

57:46.071 --> 57:47.376
Answer.

57:47.420 --> 57:48.726
Answer the phone, Marks.

57:55.341 --> 57:56.647
He's here.

58:02.261 --> 58:03.654

58:03.697 --> 58:05.482
Strip the place. Search it!

The drive's gone.

[Khadijah shushing]

We didn't do this.
We found him dead.

Put your guns down
or we will fire.

-You're making a big mistake.

58:56.010 --> 58:57.577
The only mistake
that we ever made

58:57.621 --> 58:59.623
was not putting you in a cage
when we had the chance.

58:59.666 --> 59:00.841
Listen to me, Grady.
Don't be an idiot.

59:00.885 --> 59:02.103
-This doesn't track!
-No?

59:02.147 --> 59:03.148
No!

59:03.191 --> 59:04.279
Marks was here
investigating you,

59:04.323 --> 59:05.585
and now he's dead.

59:05.629 --> 59:06.934
And you happen to be
standing with

59:06.978 --> 59:08.457
the very people
who killed your teammate.

59:08.501 --> 59:10.372
Well, I'd say it's tracking
pretty well for me.

59:10.416 --> 59:11.591
Fine. What's my motive?

59:11.635 --> 59:13.071
I don't know.
I don't care. Money.

59:13.114 --> 59:15.682
-Come on!
-Power? I don't care.

59:15.726 --> 59:17.684
Put your guns down!

59:18.729 --> 59:20.731
I've got four more agents
out on the street.

59:20.774 --> 59:22.036

Come on, Gracie.

Let's go.

I'm sorry.

I cannot do this anymore.

There are six officers
coming up the stairs right now.

Oh, you speak English.

that you're not dead

means that
somebody's protecting you.

we can go about this

or we can do it the hard way.

We know you don't care
about the cause.

delivering is very dangerous.

the easy way.

1:06:01.392 --> 1:06:03.481
[sighs] Me neither.

1:06:06.092 --> 1:06:09.313
Get some rest. You'll need it.

1:06:42.259 --> 1:06:43.477
[phone beeps]

1:06:44.261 --> 1:06:45.392
What'd you tell him?

1:06:45.436 --> 1:06:47.264
That I'd be a bit longer.

1:06:47.307 --> 1:06:49.222
And what'd he say?

1:06:50.354 --> 1:06:52.399
He hasn't been sleeping well.

1:06:53.313 --> 1:06:54.749
Without me.

1:06:56.490 --> 1:06:58.014
That's real love, huh?

1:06:58.057 --> 1:07:00.146
That's real life, Mace.

1:07:00.190 --> 1:07:02.409
James Bond never
has to deal with real life.

1:07:02.453 --> 1:07:05.804
James Bond always ends up alone.

1:07:09.851 --> 1:07:12.332
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

1:07:12.376 --> 1:07:14.943
-Coffee?
-Thank you.

1:07:14.987 --> 1:07:16.597
Okay, here's the plan.

1:07:16.641 --> 1:07:19.252
They're setting up
for the auction.

1:07:19.296 --> 1:07:20.819
There'll be security
on all sides.

1:07:20.862 --> 1:07:24.170
The best way in
is through the front.

1:07:25.084 --> 1:07:26.781
In there is a closed system.

1:07:26.825 --> 1:07:30.307
I've tried to get in remotely,
but I need physical access.

1:07:31.612 --> 1:07:33.440
Once we're all inside,

1:07:33.484 --> 1:07:36.443
I can get into the cameras,
power, security systems

1:07:36.487 --> 1:07:37.662
and steer you
the rest of the way through.

1:07:37.705 --> 1:07:40.404
You'll have cameras
in your jewelry,

1:07:40.447 --> 1:07:41.448
comms in your earrings.

1:07:41.492 --> 1:07:42.884
We'll be connected at all times.

1:07:46.671 --> 1:07:48.455
How do we
get past the front door?

1:07:48.499 --> 1:07:50.153
I can get us on the list.

1:07:51.850 --> 1:07:53.721
-Thank you.
-It's Anderson. Yeah.

1:07:53.765 --> 1:07:54.940
...Z-L-R...

1:07:56.811 --> 1:07:58.987
Now, the event
is a legitimate auction

1:07:59.031 --> 1:08:01.120
for ancient art and artifacts.

1:08:01.164 --> 1:08:04.602
But it's just a cover
for the real proximity auction

1:08:04.645 --> 1:08:07.909
taking place on the dark net
on their phones.

1:08:07.953 --> 1:08:09.607
Silent, invite-only.

1:08:09.650 --> 1:08:11.957
That's where the real bidding
for the drive

1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:13.480
will be taking place.

1:08:13.524 --> 1:08:16.483
That drive will be hidden
in one of the items for sale.

1:08:16.527 --> 1:08:18.485
-Which one?
-I don't know yet.

1:08:18.529 --> 1:08:22.576
So, we'll have to rely
on your... social skills.

1:08:22.620 --> 1:08:25.318
I'll need you
to make new friends

1:08:25.362 --> 1:08:27.320
to I.D. the item.

1:08:27.364 --> 1:08:30.367
This list is like half
the CIA's most wanted.

1:08:34.719 --> 1:08:37.113
When it goes up for auction,

1:08:37.156 --> 1:08:40.159
I'll create a diversion,
you grab it and go.

1:08:46.296 --> 1:08:48.863
-[women chattering]
-Help me. I can't...

1:08:48.907 --> 1:08:50.735
Why isn't it opening?

1:08:52.432 --> 1:08:54.217
[woman grunts]

1:09:03.095 --> 1:09:05.489
Okay, I'm in position.

1:09:08.231 --> 1:09:10.711
Gray hair,
between the two statues.

1:09:10.755 --> 1:09:12.278
He's emitting two signals,

1:09:12.322 --> 1:09:14.411
and he's focusing too much
on that program.

1:09:14.454 --> 1:09:16.413
[lively chatter]

1:09:17.283 --> 1:09:19.111
I'll spill my drink on him.

1:09:19.155 --> 1:09:21.418
-Where'd you learn that move?
-[over earpiece]: Paris.

1:09:21.461 --> 1:09:23.507
Enemy agent.
Ruined my favorite dress.

1:09:23.550 --> 1:09:25.117
If that was your favorite dress,

1:09:25.161 --> 1:09:27.163
she really did you a favor.

1:09:27.206 --> 1:09:28.642
-[both gasp]
-Oh, no!

1:09:28.686 --> 1:09:31.471
-I'm okay.
-Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

1:09:31.515 --> 1:09:32.777
It's all right.

1:09:35.954 --> 1:09:38.826
[hushed]:
God, this is so uncomfortable.

1:09:38.870 --> 1:09:40.828
It itches so much.

1:09:40.872 --> 1:09:42.395
[sighs]

1:09:42.439 --> 1:09:46.660
A woman such as yourself
should never be alone.

1:09:50.534 --> 1:09:53.406
Gracie, say "thank you." Flirt.

1:09:53.450 --> 1:09:55.234
Thank you.

1:09:55.278 --> 1:09:57.932
[whispers]:
I'm no good at flirting.

1:09:57.976 --> 1:09:59.717
Luckily, I am.

1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:01.980
Okay, your friend's
name is Pyotr Khasanov.

1:10:02.023 --> 1:10:02.981
Chechen billionaire.

1:10:03.024 --> 1:10:04.591
Just act interested.

1:10:04.635 --> 1:10:06.898
Don't think of it as seduction.
Think of it as deduction.

1:10:06.941 --> 1:10:08.682
He's just a patient
with a problem.

1:10:08.726 --> 1:10:10.293
Find it.

1:10:12.251 --> 1:10:16.212
What brings you here?
Are you a collector of art?

1:10:16.995 --> 1:10:20.128
I'm a collector of...
many things.

1:10:20.172 --> 1:10:22.305
Ooh.

1:10:31.923 --> 1:10:33.054
[both laughing]

1:10:33.098 --> 1:10:34.230
Here you go.

1:10:34.273 --> 1:10:36.841
It really is a very nice suit.

1:10:39.757 --> 1:10:41.106
-Thank you.
-Good as new.

1:10:41.149 --> 1:10:42.281
Thank you.

1:10:42.325 --> 1:10:43.500
I'm scouting out front.

1:10:43.543 --> 1:10:46.807
I'm just checking something out.

1:10:49.549 --> 1:10:51.464
He didn't get past
the third page.

1:10:51.508 --> 1:10:53.640
Okay, there's five items
on that page, Gracie.

1:10:53.684 --> 1:10:56.513
Painting, mirror, dagger,
dragon's head, vase.

1:10:57.340 --> 1:10:58.689
What is it you like?

1:10:58.732 --> 1:11:01.561
Painting seems too boring--
no surprises.

1:11:01.605 --> 1:11:03.389
I do like to be surprised.

1:11:03.433 --> 1:11:05.435
Ancient weapons?

1:11:06.914 --> 1:11:09.177
No. You seem like
a man of the future.

1:11:09.221 --> 1:11:13.181
And I have a feeling you have
enough weapons already.

1:11:13.225 --> 1:11:15.749
What did you say your name was?

1:11:22.234 --> 1:11:23.931
I thought you liked surprises.

1:11:25.672 --> 1:11:27.761
Which means an antique mirror

1:11:27.805 --> 1:11:30.155
wouldn't be right for you
either since you already know

1:11:30.198 --> 1:11:31.852
-what you're gonna see in it.
-[chuckles]

1:11:31.896 --> 1:11:34.159
His eyes are dilating.
He's more interested in you.

1:11:34.202 --> 1:11:35.247
It's not the mirror.

1:11:35.291 --> 1:11:36.596
I like this game.

1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:39.860
Mm, yes.
You do like games, don't you?

1:11:39.904 --> 1:11:42.515
Well, the game is not over.

1:11:42.559 --> 1:11:45.083
I still don't know
what you're here for.

1:11:48.173 --> 1:11:50.218
A dragon's head.

1:11:50.262 --> 1:11:52.395
A symbol of power.

1:11:53.265 --> 1:11:54.788
Perhaps.

1:11:57.269 --> 1:11:58.662
Hmm.

1:12:00.098 --> 1:12:01.404
Buena suerte.

1:12:01.447 --> 1:12:04.494
Wait. Where are you going?
The game's not over.

1:12:04.537 --> 1:12:06.409
It's in the vase.

1:12:09.281 --> 1:12:11.762
Mace, everyone's in position.

1:12:11.805 --> 1:12:12.806
The auction's about to begin.

1:12:12.850 --> 1:12:15.200
Rolling back to you. [gasps]

1:12:16.201 --> 1:12:17.420
Hi.

1:12:18.421 --> 1:12:19.465
You're alive.

1:12:19.509 --> 1:12:20.727
Bloody hell.

1:12:20.771 --> 1:12:22.990
It's good to see you, Mace.

1:12:23.991 --> 1:12:25.428
Come here.

1:12:30.389 --> 1:12:32.130
Oh, my God.

1:12:32.173 --> 1:12:33.305
[sighs]

1:12:33.349 --> 1:12:35.046
I don't understand.

1:12:36.003 --> 1:12:37.309
Hey, Khadij.

1:12:37.962 --> 1:12:40.443
I'd like to see her alone now.

1:12:41.748 --> 1:12:44.142
Hey, what-what is this?
What is your op?

1:12:44.185 --> 1:12:46.405
-Mace... -Why didn't the Agency
tell me what was going on?

1:12:46.449 --> 1:12:48.407
There's no op. Things changed.

1:12:55.545 --> 1:12:56.937
MI SHENG [over speakers]:
Welcome.

1:12:56.981 --> 1:12:59.244
[speaks Mandarin]

1:12:59.287 --> 1:13:01.464
Thank you all for attending.

1:13:01.507 --> 1:13:03.596
I will be hosting
tonight's auction.

1:13:03.640 --> 1:13:04.945
I'm not getting anything
on the host.

1:13:04.989 --> 1:13:07.339
Please take your seats.

1:13:07.383 --> 1:13:09.472
We are about to begin.

1:13:13.650 --> 1:13:15.565
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:13:15.608 --> 1:13:17.131
We begin tonight's auction

1:13:17.175 --> 1:13:19.525
with this Chinese painting
from the third century.

1:13:20.396 --> 1:13:21.919
We will begin our auction
at 8,000.

1:13:21.962 --> 1:13:24.312
-We're in position.
-Do I have 8,000?

1:13:24.356 --> 1:13:26.445
-8,000...
-Where's Mace?

1:13:26.489 --> 1:13:27.881
Following a lead.

1:13:36.194 --> 1:13:37.630
Uh...

1:13:37.674 --> 1:13:39.545
I've lost access to the network.

1:13:41.678 --> 1:13:43.636
I'm compromised.
Someone's hacking me back.

1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:45.421
I need to reposition,
baseline my gear.

1:13:45.464 --> 1:13:46.987
Give me 15 seconds. Do not move.

1:13:47.031 --> 1:13:48.902
17,000, 18.

1:13:52.602 --> 1:13:54.081
Any more? 19. Do I have 20?

1:13:54.125 --> 1:13:55.779
As soon as they wheel
that thing out,

1:13:55.822 --> 1:13:56.997
we need to make a move.

1:13:57.041 --> 1:13:58.434
No. She said to stay here.

1:13:58.477 --> 1:13:59.913
She can't kill the lights.

1:14:02.002 --> 1:14:03.743
[panting]

1:14:05.528 --> 1:14:06.703
[grunts]

1:14:07.617 --> 1:14:09.096
You're working with murderers?

1:14:09.140 --> 1:14:10.620
And you're not?

1:14:10.663 --> 1:14:12.796
How many people
have the CIA assassinated?

1:14:12.839 --> 1:14:14.362
How many states
have they toppled?

1:14:14.406 --> 1:14:15.842
How many wars have they started?

1:14:15.886 --> 1:14:17.670
You're on your own now, right?

1:14:17.714 --> 1:14:20.543
Off the grid? On the run?

1:14:21.848 --> 1:14:23.589
How does it feel?

1:14:24.416 --> 1:14:26.244
Tell me.

1:14:29.987 --> 1:14:32.250
How does it feel to be free?

1:14:33.033 --> 1:14:35.514
The next item
is a 13th century vase

1:14:35.558 --> 1:14:38.256
from the Chinese Yuan dynasty.

1:14:39.387 --> 1:14:41.041
I'm not losing that drive again.

1:14:41.085 --> 1:14:42.695
We will start the bidding

1:14:42.739 --> 1:14:46.090
at 100,000 U.S. dollars.

1:14:46.830 --> 1:14:49.615
100,000. 110, 20. 130,000.

1:14:49.659 --> 1:14:51.530
130, 140. Thank you.

1:14:51.574 --> 1:14:52.836
Any more bids from the phones?

1:14:52.879 --> 1:14:54.446
[whispers]:
Khadijah, are we back in?

1:14:54.490 --> 1:14:57.710
I'm into the cameras,
but I can't get in the lights.

1:14:57.754 --> 1:15:00.191
Looks like the real bidding's
started, though.

1:15:00.234 --> 1:15:02.149
The hardest thing
about all this, Mace,

1:15:02.193 --> 1:15:04.587
was thinking
I'd never see you again.

1:15:05.718 --> 1:15:07.546
Wow.

1:15:07.590 --> 1:15:09.417
This is an angle.

1:15:09.461 --> 1:15:11.332
I can't believe
you're trying to work me.

1:15:11.376 --> 1:15:13.160
If I didn't want you to see me,
you wouldn't have seen me.

1:15:13.204 --> 1:15:14.901
Oh, you didn't want me
to see you in Paris, did you?

1:15:14.945 --> 1:15:16.294
You wanted me to think
that you were dead.

1:15:16.337 --> 1:15:19.210
Yeah, so you were clean.
I did that for you.

1:15:19.253 --> 1:15:21.212
For me? Uh-huh.

1:15:21.255 --> 1:15:23.736
Without any regard
to how it would make me feel.

1:15:24.781 --> 1:15:26.739
How did it make you feel?

1:15:31.135 --> 1:15:32.789
Bitter.

1:15:36.619 --> 1:15:38.882
You're still wearing this ring.

1:15:40.144 --> 1:15:42.102
The bidding's
over a hundred mil.

1:15:44.583 --> 1:15:46.629
What's it gonna be, Mace?

1:15:48.587 --> 1:15:50.458
Come with me.

1:15:56.943 --> 1:15:59.076
I need this back.

1:16:03.820 --> 1:16:06.083
Always such a tough guy.

1:16:07.954 --> 1:16:11.349
Okay. Keep her here
out of the way.

1:16:14.700 --> 1:16:16.963
[speaking Romanian]

1:16:23.230 --> 1:16:24.667
[grunting]

1:16:26.712 --> 1:16:29.019
[choking]

1:16:37.201 --> 1:16:39.333
-- 300,000.
-- We have 300,000.

1:16:39.377 --> 1:16:41.509
-Any more from the phones?
-350,000.

1:16:41.553 --> 1:16:43.163
-Thank you, sir.
-[crowd gasps]

1:16:43.207 --> 1:16:44.817
Any more on 350?

1:16:44.861 --> 1:16:46.340
-Anyone willing to
give me more? -Who's that?

1:16:46.384 --> 1:16:48.299
-Do I have
any higher bids? -A ghost.

1:16:48.342 --> 1:16:50.214
Fair warning with you, sir.

1:16:50.257 --> 1:16:51.781
-500,000.
-[crowd gasps]

1:16:51.824 --> 1:16:53.826
Half a million.

1:16:53.870 --> 1:16:55.262
Currently at $500,000,

1:16:55.306 --> 1:16:56.873
-ladies and gentlemen.
-We're gonna lose it.

1:16:56.916 --> 1:16:58.570
We have to move.

1:16:58.614 --> 1:17:00.354
If the drive is in that vase,

1:17:00.398 --> 1:17:02.661
I can tag
the electronic signature.

1:17:02.705 --> 1:17:04.402
But you'll have to get closer.

1:17:04.445 --> 1:17:06.534
We can tag it, tail it,
and then we can make a move

1:17:06.578 --> 1:17:07.884
as soon as it's clear.

1:17:07.927 --> 1:17:09.276
-Do I have...
-A million.

1:17:09.320 --> 1:17:12.279
-[crowd murmuring]
-One million.

1:17:13.237 --> 1:17:15.456
One million U.S. dollars
with the gentleman.

1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:17.589
He's just bid

1:17:17.633 --> 1:17:19.025
$300 million online.

1:17:19.069 --> 1:17:21.854
I have a way to get closer.

1:17:21.898 --> 1:17:24.944
Any further bids on the phones?

1:17:24.988 --> 1:17:26.990
It is now or never.

1:17:27.033 --> 1:17:28.252
Did you get what you wanted?

1:17:28.295 --> 1:17:29.601
This is the last bid.

1:17:29.645 --> 1:17:31.821
-Now I did.
-[chuckles]

1:17:33.083 --> 1:17:34.737
One million and one, anyone?

1:17:34.780 --> 1:17:36.739
He's at half a billion dollars.

1:17:36.782 --> 1:17:38.479
The gavel is up.

1:17:38.523 --> 1:17:39.916
She's too exposed.

1:17:39.959 --> 1:17:42.222
You're not close enough, Gracie.

1:17:42.266 --> 1:17:43.659
Going once.

1:17:43.702 --> 1:17:45.356
Shall we go?

1:17:45.399 --> 1:17:47.010
Going twice.

1:17:48.881 --> 1:17:50.361
Going three times and...

1:17:52.102 --> 1:17:53.146
...sold.

1:17:53.799 --> 1:17:55.235
Got it.

1:17:55.279 --> 1:17:57.498
Highest bidder
with the gentleman.

1:17:59.283 --> 1:18:02.895
-Oh, so sorry. -Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:18:04.114 --> 1:18:06.507
Actually, she's with me.

1:18:06.551 --> 1:18:08.118
Thank you.

1:18:08.945 --> 1:18:10.207
Sorry.

1:18:14.167 --> 1:18:16.430
The package
is rolling to a back area.

1:18:16.474 --> 1:18:19.172
I'm on a balcony, first hall
southeast of the auction.

1:18:19.216 --> 1:18:22.785
Marie, meet me here.
Gracie, meet us outside.

1:18:24.787 --> 1:18:26.092
[man grunting]

1:18:26.136 --> 1:18:28.399
[Mace grunting fiercely]

1:18:35.188 --> 1:18:37.103
[choking]

1:18:49.681 --> 1:18:52.510
Let's show the people at home
what they won.

1:18:52.553 --> 1:18:53.990
[door closes]

1:18:55.643 --> 1:18:58.995
500 million's a lot of money,
even for the guy I represent.

1:18:59.038 --> 1:19:00.387
Just want to make sure it works.

1:19:00.431 --> 1:19:02.563
-[whirring]
-The package is in

1:19:02.607 --> 1:19:03.956
an office two halls away.

1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:05.436
Security?

1:19:05.479 --> 1:19:07.481
The buyer has a team.
The seller has an army.

1:19:07.525 --> 1:19:08.787
[sighs] What do we have?

1:19:08.831 --> 1:19:11.094
Please don't say "each other."

1:19:15.925 --> 1:19:18.623
Acetone. Hydrogen peroxide.

1:19:18.666 --> 1:19:20.233
Your file says demolitions.

1:19:20.277 --> 1:19:21.844
Can you make this work?

1:19:30.722 --> 1:19:32.506
We will require the full fee

1:19:32.550 --> 1:19:34.639
-before you leave.
-Of course.

1:19:34.682 --> 1:19:35.814
[men chattering]

1:19:52.396 --> 1:19:54.050
[glass crackling]

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:57.531
-[explosion]
-[men screaming]

1:19:57.575 --> 1:20:00.273
[alarm wailing]

1:20:00.317 --> 1:20:02.319
What's that?

1:20:02.362 --> 1:20:04.582
-[alarm continues wailing]
-[Mace grunting fiercely]

1:20:20.772 --> 1:20:22.339
[Marie grunts]

1:20:23.514 --> 1:20:25.168
[guns racking]

1:20:26.734 --> 1:20:28.127
[phone ringing]

1:20:43.273 --> 1:20:45.449
-[crowd clamoring]
-[alarm continues wailing]

1:20:52.848 --> 1:20:55.285
Down there, to the left.

1:20:55.328 --> 1:20:57.243
[men shouting in Mandarin]

1:21:02.945 --> 1:21:04.947
[shouting continues]

1:21:10.256 --> 1:21:12.955
-[Mi Sheng speaks Mandarin]
-[shouting stops]

1:21:18.221 --> 1:21:19.613
Drop your weapons.

1:21:21.137 --> 1:21:22.529
Both of you.

1:21:31.103 --> 1:21:32.322
[Marie sighs]

1:21:42.506 --> 1:21:44.029
Go.

1:21:46.423 --> 1:21:47.990
Go.

1:21:53.778 --> 1:21:56.476
-[crowd clamoring]
-[alarm continues wailing]

1:21:56.520 --> 1:21:58.957
-Nick!
-[sirens wailing in distance]

1:21:59.001 --> 1:22:00.959
[panting]

1:22:01.003 --> 1:22:03.440
I'm going with you.

1:22:06.138 --> 1:22:07.966
I see Mace.

1:22:08.010 --> 1:22:10.142
Khadijah.

1:22:13.015 --> 1:22:14.233
[groans]

1:22:14.277 --> 1:22:15.539
The only place
I'll join you is hell.

1:22:23.025 --> 1:22:24.591
Shoot me.

1:22:27.116 --> 1:22:29.596
And I'll have him
fire into the crowd.

1:22:33.905 --> 1:22:36.125
-Can't do it, can you?
-[sighs]

1:22:40.042 --> 1:22:42.653
[tires squealing]

1:22:42.696 --> 1:22:43.959
Shit.

1:22:44.002 --> 1:22:44.960
Mace!

1:22:45.003 --> 1:22:46.439
[panting]

1:22:46.483 --> 1:22:47.788
-What are you doing?
-Mace, what happened to you?

1:22:47.832 --> 1:22:49.007
Mace.

1:22:49.051 --> 1:22:51.140
-[sirens wailing]
-[tires squealing]

1:22:51.183 --> 1:22:53.403
[officers shouting in Mandarin]

1:22:54.534 --> 1:22:57.015
-Let's get out!
-Let's get out of here!

1:22:57.059 --> 1:22:58.060
Get in.

1:22:58.103 --> 1:23:00.236
Come with me.

1:23:01.063 --> 1:23:02.499
[officers continue shouting]

1:23:08.244 --> 1:23:10.724
I can treat her wounds
where we're going.

1:23:10.768 --> 1:23:12.074
And where are we going?

1:23:12.117 --> 1:23:13.205
Who are you?

1:23:13.249 --> 1:23:15.773
My name is Lin Mi Sheng.

1:23:15.816 --> 1:23:17.905
I work for the Ministry.

1:23:17.949 --> 1:23:20.299
It's nice to finally meet.

1:23:25.087 --> 1:23:27.350
[door rumbling and creaking]

1:23:33.269 --> 1:23:34.487
I'm fine.

1:23:34.531 --> 1:23:35.923
Easy.

1:23:35.967 --> 1:23:37.273
[gasps] Yeah.

1:23:38.361 --> 1:23:40.102
Would anyone like tea?

1:23:41.320 --> 1:23:43.409
I have a wide assortment
of herbs.

1:23:43.453 --> 1:23:45.020
What the hell is going on?

1:23:45.063 --> 1:23:49.067
We were hoping the CIA would
secure the drive in Paris.

1:23:49.111 --> 1:23:52.592
When that didn't happen,
it was essential we reclaim it

1:23:52.636 --> 1:23:55.073
before it fell into
the wrong hands.

1:24:02.124 --> 1:24:04.778
My father convinced our bosses

1:24:04.822 --> 1:24:07.520
that this could be
a larger opportunity.

1:24:08.913 --> 1:24:10.697
What kind of opportunity?

1:24:15.485 --> 1:24:18.009
I believe you met
Pyotr Khasanov.

1:24:18.053 --> 1:24:22.448
If he can disrupt oil
production in the Middle East,

1:24:22.492 --> 1:24:24.276
his profits will skyrocket.

1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:26.322
Raza Magodosh.

1:24:26.365 --> 1:24:28.280
Freelance from Dubai.

1:24:28.324 --> 1:24:32.241
He promises disruption to any
state willing to pay for it.

1:24:33.590 --> 1:24:35.940
This one is a front
for the Iranians.

1:24:36.810 --> 1:24:39.639
This gentleman is
an international mercenary

1:24:39.683 --> 1:24:42.164
specializing in Central Africa.

1:24:44.253 --> 1:24:46.255
There are
many rogue players today.

1:24:46.298 --> 1:24:50.302
This was an opportunity
to collect information on them.

1:24:50.346 --> 1:24:54.480
So this was all some kind
of fishing expedition?

1:24:54.524 --> 1:24:56.656
Selling deadly intel
to the highest bidder

1:24:56.700 --> 1:24:58.528
just to see
who's out there bidding?

1:24:59.877 --> 1:25:01.183
We sold them nothing.

1:25:01.226 --> 1:25:03.315
What?

1:25:04.142 --> 1:25:05.839
The drive is right here.

1:25:09.365 --> 1:25:10.888
[keypad beeping]

1:25:17.547 --> 1:25:19.505
You killed Marks for that.

1:25:19.549 --> 1:25:21.290
You knocked out the power?

1:25:21.333 --> 1:25:22.813
The planes?

1:25:23.814 --> 1:25:25.207
No.

1:25:26.730 --> 1:25:27.905
Marks did.

1:25:28.906 --> 1:25:30.951
He was working with Nick.

1:25:31.735 --> 1:25:34.433
But if you were
to go out on your own,

1:25:34.477 --> 1:25:37.436
I could understand
how that might happen.

1:25:39.960 --> 1:25:41.397
I knew you'd get it done.

1:25:42.224 --> 1:25:44.748
I stopped him
before they could do more.

1:25:46.619 --> 1:25:49.709
They were working for this man,
Elijah Clarke,

1:25:49.753 --> 1:25:53.539
a known financier for
international terror groups.

1:25:56.238 --> 1:25:57.500
The drive is safe now.

1:25:57.543 --> 1:25:59.893
The world is safe.

1:26:00.677 --> 1:26:03.419
You'll all be going home soon.

1:26:06.813 --> 1:26:08.032
It's done.

1:26:08.075 --> 1:26:10.208
Told you I'd get it.

1:26:10.252 --> 1:26:12.341
Yeah, you did.

1:26:13.864 --> 1:26:14.995
Where's my cut?

1:26:15.039 --> 1:26:17.259
Of course. Your cut.

1:26:24.004 --> 1:26:25.397
[scoffs softly]

1:26:27.269 --> 1:26:28.574
We had a deal.

1:26:28.618 --> 1:26:30.359
I got you the drive.

1:26:30.402 --> 1:26:31.969
No, you didn't.

1:26:32.012 --> 1:26:36.887
You got me a decoy,
a $500 million paperweight.

1:26:40.673 --> 1:26:42.675
They must have swapped.

1:26:43.285 --> 1:26:45.243
[cries out]

1:26:45.287 --> 1:26:47.724
They must have swapped it.

1:26:50.988 --> 1:26:51.989
[groans]

1:26:52.032 --> 1:26:53.599
[panting]

1:26:54.339 --> 1:26:56.036
[phone buzzing]

1:26:57.734 --> 1:26:59.779
-Hey.
-Hey, it's me.

1:26:59.823 --> 1:27:03.000
Listen, I'm sorry
I didn't call you sooner.

1:27:03.043 --> 1:27:05.959
It couldn't be helped.
I don't know what else to say.

1:27:06.003 --> 1:27:08.527
I get it. I just, um...

1:27:08.571 --> 1:27:11.313
You know, I just wanted
to know you're okay.

1:27:11.356 --> 1:27:13.184
Well, I'm fine.

1:27:13.228 --> 1:27:14.620
I can handle myself, you know.

1:27:14.664 --> 1:27:16.231
I didn't say you couldn't.

1:27:16.274 --> 1:27:18.407
I'm on the first flight back.

1:27:18.450 --> 1:27:19.799
The sooner I get off this phone,

1:27:19.843 --> 1:27:21.627
the faster I can wrap up
and get on that plane.

1:27:21.671 --> 1:27:23.803
Well, I wouldn't want
to keep you.

1:27:23.847 --> 1:27:25.979
I didn't mean it like that.

1:27:26.023 --> 1:27:27.416
No, I get it.

1:27:28.243 --> 1:27:29.809
I'm sorry.

1:27:33.378 --> 1:27:34.814
I'm sorry.

1:27:34.858 --> 1:27:36.990
I'm looking forward
to being home, too.

1:27:37.034 --> 1:27:38.383
Really?

1:27:39.036 --> 1:27:40.690
[speaking Arabic]

1:27:41.430 --> 1:27:42.866
I'll see you soon.

1:27:43.867 --> 1:27:45.042
See you soon.

1:27:48.393 --> 1:27:49.960
[chuckles softly]

1:27:50.917 --> 1:27:51.962
Hola, mami.

1:27:55.618 --> 1:27:57.663
[boy babbling happily]

1:28:20.033 --> 1:28:21.470
You were dreaming.

1:28:21.513 --> 1:28:23.080
[Mace sighs]

1:28:24.690 --> 1:28:26.910
You were having a bad dream.

1:28:28.477 --> 1:28:32.829
Your dream was about how you
didn't see the signs, right?

1:28:32.872 --> 1:28:34.874
When you live a life of lies,

1:28:34.918 --> 1:28:37.747
it's hard to know
what's true and what isn't.

1:28:40.706 --> 1:28:42.926
I thought I knew.

1:28:44.841 --> 1:28:48.714
I was in control my whole life.

1:28:51.282 --> 1:28:53.806
I took care of myself because...

1:28:58.768 --> 1:29:00.987
...I didn't have anybody.

1:29:04.426 --> 1:29:06.123
I got used to that life.

1:29:06.166 --> 1:29:10.432
It made me
really, really good...

1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:13.696
...at this life.

1:29:15.437 --> 1:29:17.917
I'm sorry you were betrayed.

1:29:19.179 --> 1:29:20.920
[sighs]

1:29:21.660 --> 1:29:24.446
I know what that feels like.

1:29:29.973 --> 1:29:31.714
Mm-mm.

1:29:34.194 --> 1:29:35.631
Maybe you should.

1:29:39.983 --> 1:29:41.158
[sniffs]

1:29:46.555 --> 1:29:47.947
Mmm.

1:29:47.991 --> 1:29:49.209
[sniffles]

1:29:51.560 --> 1:29:52.648
[sighs]

1:29:52.691 --> 1:29:54.519
[inhales sharply]

1:29:59.263 --> 1:30:00.395
Thank you.

1:30:00.438 --> 1:30:01.831
[chuckles softly]

1:30:07.750 --> 1:30:09.186
[pained groan]

1:30:12.581 --> 1:30:14.583
Can I help you?

1:30:14.626 --> 1:30:17.499
Mm. Hoping for some of that tea.

1:30:17.542 --> 1:30:18.804
I'm starting to feel
my face again.

1:30:18.848 --> 1:30:22.199
Chinese herbs
have many qualities.

1:30:23.722 --> 1:30:26.856
This will end your pain forever.

1:30:28.248 --> 1:30:30.860
Let me find something
a little less strong.

1:30:33.297 --> 1:30:34.777
So what'd you give 'em?

1:30:34.820 --> 1:30:36.996
You have the drive.
You gave them something else.

1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:38.868
We gave them something close.

1:30:38.911 --> 1:30:41.740
That was
a dangerous thing to do.

1:30:42.524 --> 1:30:44.526

1:30:44.569 --> 1:30:45.701
Right?

1:30:45.744 --> 1:30:48.965
We put ourselves in danger...

1:30:49.879 --> 1:30:52.359
...so that others are not.

1:30:53.143 --> 1:30:57.452
We all look different,
speak different,

1:31:00.411 --> 1:31:02.326

for him, Mace.

everything is our fault.

You didn't bring this
into my life.

trust the wrong guy.

1:47:58.733 --> 1:48:02.040
[door opens, closes]

1:48:05.827 --> 1:48:07.829
Put a hit out on me.

1:48:08.873 --> 1:48:11.049
A man must cover his tracks.

1:48:11.093 --> 1:48:13.008
Yeah, he does.

1:48:14.705 --> 1:48:16.620
I have ten men outside.

1:48:17.708 --> 1:48:19.580
You had ten men.

1:48:19.623 --> 1:48:21.277
Just you and me now.

1:48:26.108 --> 1:48:28.458
You were beaten
by a bunch of girls.

1:48:28.502 --> 1:48:30.591
Should have killed them
when you had the chance.

1:48:30.634 --> 1:48:32.593
They're next.

1:48:33.507 --> 1:48:34.899
You're now.

1:48:36.727 --> 1:48:38.424
One reason.

1:48:38.468 --> 1:48:40.644
Give me one reason
you keep breathing.

1:48:40.688 --> 1:48:42.820
I'll give you
a hundred million reasons

1:48:42.864 --> 1:48:44.909
if you carry on working for me.

1:48:45.693 --> 1:48:47.303
I'm good.

1:49:16.288 --> 1:49:18.769
Boss, new mission brief.

1:49:18.813 --> 1:49:20.815
It's wheels up in three hours.

1:49:22.643 --> 1:49:24.514
What about Mace and her friends?

1:49:24.558 --> 1:49:25.994
Ah, we're still working on it,

1:49:26.037 --> 1:49:28.039
but they can't
run forever, right?

1:49:28.083 --> 1:49:31.129
I mean, sooner or later,
they got to give up.

1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.176
You don't know Mace.

1:49:46.101 --> 1:49:48.016
-[keys clink]
-Nice place.

1:49:55.632 --> 1:49:57.503
I knew you'd show up eventually.

1:49:57.547 --> 1:49:59.636
If you knew I was gonna show
up, one wonders why you didn't

1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:02.552
spend a little bit more
on a better security system.

1:50:03.335 --> 1:50:06.208
You presume
I didn't want you to get in.

1:50:09.472 --> 1:50:11.692
You want a drink?

1:50:19.177 --> 1:50:20.439
Ice?

1:50:20.483 --> 1:50:22.833
You know I never take ice.

1:50:24.661 --> 1:50:26.881
Such a tough guy.

1:50:34.410 --> 1:50:37.631
One could ask how is it
you're not behind bars.

1:50:37.674 --> 1:50:39.023
But a better question is:

1:50:39.067 --> 1:50:40.851
How'd you get the Agency
to promote you?

1:50:40.895 --> 1:50:43.201
-It's not much of a mystery.
-No?

1:50:43.245 --> 1:50:45.203
Because you were
brokering a deal to sell

1:50:45.247 --> 1:50:47.597
highly classified information
the last time I checked.

1:50:47.641 --> 1:50:51.209
If you think Marks and I are
the only ones that got wise...

1:50:51.253 --> 1:50:53.995
then you never really knew
who you were working for.

1:50:55.823 --> 1:50:58.434
That explains
why I'm on the run.

1:50:59.565 --> 1:51:01.872
Well, you broke
a lot of rules, Mace.

1:51:01.916 --> 1:51:03.700
So did your friends.

1:51:03.744 --> 1:51:06.442
You can't expect the guys
in charge to suck that up.

1:51:07.269 --> 1:51:09.532
Because we're not
as useful as you are?

1:51:09.575 --> 1:51:10.794
[scoffs]

1:51:12.840 --> 1:51:14.885
Hey, Nick, remember that story

1:51:14.929 --> 1:51:16.931
that they told us about
in training?

1:51:18.062 --> 1:51:20.674
Washington's female spy.

1:51:20.717 --> 1:51:23.764
During the Revolution. Agent
355's what they called her.

1:51:23.807 --> 1:51:25.722
'Cause they didn't know
her name.

1:51:25.766 --> 1:51:28.420
Mm, someone knew her name.

1:51:28.464 --> 1:51:31.162
They just didn't want
the world to know it.

1:51:33.599 --> 1:51:37.603
You're mad because I'm on the
payroll and you're on the run.

1:51:37.647 --> 1:51:38.735
It's not right, is it?

1:51:38.779 --> 1:51:41.303
The world's not right, Mace.

1:51:42.957 --> 1:51:44.436
[chuckles softly]

1:51:45.176 --> 1:51:46.743
The world's changing.

1:51:46.787 --> 1:51:48.136
[Nick clicks tongue]

1:51:50.616 --> 1:51:52.488
You okay?

1:51:53.489 --> 1:51:55.404
Yeah. [clears throat]

1:51:57.058 --> 1:51:59.451
Maybe I just need some food.

1:51:59.495 --> 1:52:01.105
Yeah.

1:52:02.280 --> 1:52:05.457
A full day betraying
all that's best in humanity

1:52:05.501 --> 1:52:08.243
really does take it out of you,
doesn't it?

1:52:17.208 --> 1:52:18.427
Wow.

1:52:19.428 --> 1:52:21.125
It's a reunion.

1:52:21.865 --> 1:52:23.388
Sorry about shooting you.

1:52:23.432 --> 1:52:25.651
Hmm. It's okay.

1:52:25.695 --> 1:52:27.741
I survived.

1:52:27.784 --> 1:52:29.351
Not sure you will.

1:52:31.440 --> 1:52:32.833
[chuckles softly]

1:52:35.400 --> 1:52:36.750
What is this?

1:52:36.793 --> 1:52:39.013
Ancient Chinese poison.

1:52:39.840 --> 1:52:42.233
Legend says it's
collected by sealing snakes,

1:52:42.277 --> 1:52:45.019
scorpions and centipedes
in a jar,

1:52:45.062 --> 1:52:47.369
forcing them to fight
and devour each other.

1:52:48.587 --> 1:52:50.938
Sort of like the way
you see the world, Nick.

1:52:50.981 --> 1:52:52.635
[chuckles softly]

1:52:56.030 --> 1:52:57.901
It was the ice.

1:52:59.033 --> 1:53:00.469
Yeah.

1:53:04.429 --> 1:53:06.518
Heard you were looking for us,
so here we are.

1:53:06.562 --> 1:53:10.740
Figured, just like old times,
I'd do the work for you.

1:53:11.785 --> 1:53:14.657
Thanks for everything
you taught me, Nick.

1:53:14.700 --> 1:53:18.574
A girl really does need a guy
to explain it all to her.

1:53:21.707 --> 1:53:23.709
But I'll take it from here.

1:53:24.493 --> 1:53:26.930
Killing me is not gonna
change anything.

1:53:26.974 --> 1:53:28.062
I know.

1:53:28.105 --> 1:53:30.586
I'm not gonna kill you, Nick.

1:53:30.629 --> 1:53:32.457
But you're gonna wish
that I had.

1:53:32.501 --> 1:53:34.459
I have a team coming
to lock you in a cell

1:53:34.503 --> 1:53:36.200
on the other side of the world,

1:53:36.244 --> 1:53:38.463
where you'll spend
the rest of your life.

1:53:38.507 --> 1:53:41.640
You're not the only one
with contacts.

1:53:44.078 --> 1:53:46.210
And I'm not alone anymore.

1:53:49.866 --> 1:53:51.520
[whispers]:
Mace.

1:54:01.225 --> 1:54:03.619
See ya, Nick.

1:54:05.055 --> 1:54:06.840
[Graciela sighs]

1:54:06.883 --> 1:54:08.624
He was right.

1:54:08.667 --> 1:54:10.278
Our agencies are corrupt.

1:54:10.321 --> 1:54:12.019
Everything's corrupt.

1:54:12.062 --> 1:54:13.498
Look at them. [sighs]

1:54:13.542 --> 1:54:15.239
Taking a walk.

1:54:15.283 --> 1:54:17.285
Living their lives feeling safe.

1:54:18.677 --> 1:54:21.680
They'll never know how close
they came to losing it all.

1:54:21.724 --> 1:54:24.509
And they'll never know
who saved them.

1:54:25.641 --> 1:54:26.990
We've been erased.

1:54:27.034 --> 1:54:28.513
Made invisible.

1:54:35.956 --> 1:54:38.567
Hasta nunca.Good luck.

1:54:40.003 --> 1:54:41.439
I'll miss you, Dij.

1:54:41.483 --> 1:54:43.137
Yes, you will.

1:54:44.442 --> 1:54:46.096
Until the next social call.

1:54:46.140 --> 1:54:47.793
Until the next.

1:55:04.506 --> 1:55:06.421
Want to grab a drink?

1:55:07.770 --> 1:55:10.468
[sighs] Not really.

1:55:10.512 --> 1:55:12.079
Me neither.

1:55:15.125 --> 1:55:17.084
So, I, um...

1:55:17.127 --> 1:55:18.607
Oh, yeah.

1:55:18.650 --> 1:55:20.000
Okay.

1:55:21.262 --> 1:55:23.525
Hey, Marie.

1:55:25.527 --> 1:55:26.702
Bye.
