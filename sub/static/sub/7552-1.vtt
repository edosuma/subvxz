00:19.787 --> 00:21.086
Now, here's a promise.

00:21.088 --> 00:24.189
If you do not lose the match,
you're gonna be found

00:24.191 --> 00:27.526
at the bottom of the swimming
pool wearing lead boots.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.829
Is there any part of that you
don't understand?

00:32.232 --> 00:33.732
And one more thing.

00:33.734 --> 00:37.002
Not a word of this to anybody,

00:37.004 --> 00:38.637
because I will know.

00:39.906 --> 00:41.707
I will know.

01:21.047 --> 01:22.481
Okay.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.364
Oh, great.

02:26.012 --> 02:28.180
All right,
boys and girls.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.114
Let's do it.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.349
We got to hurry up.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.784
The mayor himself's gonna want
to come out here and play.

02:32.786 --> 02:33.952
Well, what's it for?

02:33.954 --> 02:34.820
Five bucks.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.089
Five bucks? Why don't we
make it 110 bucks?

02:37.091 --> 02:38.023
As if he had it.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.358
10's good.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.093
All right, cool. Here, give
me back the money.

02:41.095 --> 02:41.894
Give me that money.

02:41.896 --> 02:43.395
Here you go, Princess. Cheers.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.397
All right, classic
cross-country golf rules.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.932
You can tee it up
anywhere you want to,

02:46.934 --> 02:49.334
but you can't run with it or
throw it, Natalie.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.036
Yeah, you gotta hit it
over a building,

02:51.038 --> 02:53.138
under a bridge, through
the tunnel.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.040
You ready, sports fans?

02:55.042 --> 02:56.942
First one to hole out
at the Muni.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.243
May the best woman win.

02:58.245 --> 02:59.711
Ready, set...

02:59.713 --> 03:01.647
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a second!

03:01.649 --> 03:03.048
Shouldn't we give Natalie
a head start?

03:03.050 --> 03:05.951
Yeah, shouldn't Natalie
have a head start?

03:05.953 --> 03:06.818
You know what, baby? What?

03:06.820 --> 03:10.989
I'm gonna give you a
30-second head start.

03:10.991 --> 03:12.024
What?

03:12.026 --> 03:12.858
You ready? Mm-hmm.

03:12.860 --> 03:17.095
All right, three, two, one!

03:17.097 --> 03:18.363
Oh, that's my girl!

03:18.365 --> 03:20.399
I can't believe you let her
have a head start!

03:20.401 --> 03:23.235
She's smarter, faster, and a be
better putter than you are.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.037
You know what? A real gentleman
wouldn't even ask

03:25.039 --> 03:25.938
that question.

03:25.940 --> 03:27.372
Well, excuse me.

03:27.374 --> 03:30.209
On three, two...

03:30.211 --> 03:31.043
See ya!

03:31.045 --> 03:34.913
Dirty, rotten, cheatin'
bastard!

04:14.187 --> 04:15.487
Hey, Lionel?

04:17.790 --> 04:19.257
I'm gonna leave you some money,
okay?

04:19.260 --> 04:22.995
This is for food, not
for drinks.

04:22.997 --> 04:25.597
God loves you, baby.

04:57.997 --> 04:59.564
What are you doing?

05:00.466 --> 05:02.768
I'm playin' golf.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.706
I love golf.

05:12.779 --> 05:18.250
Augustus Maximus Baccus, this a
ain't no golf course.

05:18.252 --> 05:19.951
Well, look at this.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.019
My old Little League coach,

05:21.021 --> 05:23.355
now a uniformed motorcycle cop.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.456
Well, praise the Lord, man.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.191
I feel much safer now.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.093
Well, you winnin'?

05:28.095 --> 05:29.328
Not really.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.663
Well, hell, get on.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.764
You serious?

05:32.766 --> 05:35.901
Come on before somebody pulls
out a cell phone.

05:38.204 --> 05:40.339
Yee-haw!

05:53.386 --> 05:54.920
Sir, just a second!

05:58.424 --> 05:59.925
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

06:01.527 --> 06:02.461
Sorry, guys!

06:02.463 --> 06:05.330
I'm trying to beat Augie and Na
Natalie to the 18th!

06:05.332 --> 06:06.064
Thank you, Buster!

06:06.066 --> 06:08.800
Hey, I'll share my winnings wit
h you, all right?

06:16.609 --> 06:18.310
Oh!

06:18.312 --> 06:19.611
Oh, no! No!

06:19.613 --> 06:21.346
You can't use motorized
assistance, you schmuck!

06:21.348 --> 06:24.116
We are filing an official
grievance with the committee!

06:24.118 --> 06:25.650
Oh, quit your whinin', babies!

06:25.652 --> 06:27.352
Give me my cash.

06:27.354 --> 06:28.387
I don't have it.

06:28.389 --> 06:29.421
What? You don't have it?

06:29.423 --> 06:32.324
Nope. Gave it to Lionel.

06:32.326 --> 06:33.392
What?!

06:33.394 --> 06:34.326
Gave it to Lionel?

06:34.328 --> 06:36.828
Baby, he had no skin in
this match!

06:36.830 --> 06:38.930
Maybe not, but he needs it
more than we do.

06:38.932 --> 06:43.535
¶ Oh, when the saints
go marchin' in ¶

06:43.537 --> 06:47.806
¶ Oh, when the saints go
marchin' in ¶

06:47.808 --> 06:52.611
¶ Oh, how I want to be
in that number ¶

06:52.613 --> 06:56.915
¶ When the saints go marchin'
in ¶

06:56.917 --> 06:57.916
¶ Oh, when the saints ¶

06:57.918 --> 06:59.117
¶ Oh, when the saints ¶

06:59.119 --> 07:00.119
¶ Go marchin' in ¶

07:00.120 --> 07:01.153
¶ Go marchin' in ¶

07:01.155 --> 07:05.190
¶ When the saints go marchin'
in ¶

07:05.192 --> 07:09.828
¶ Oh, how I want to be
in that number ¶

07:09.830 --> 07:13.899
¶ When the saints go marchin'
in ¶

07:13.901 --> 07:16.334
¶ Oh, when the trumpet
¶

07:16.336 --> 07:17.936
¶ Sounds its call ¶

07:17.938 --> 07:20.439
¶ Oh, when the
trumpet ¶

07:22.176 --> 07:27.045

07:27.047 --> 07:31.082
¶ When the trumpet

07:47.000 --> 07:49.067
¶ Yes, they go marchin' ¶

07:49.069 --> 07:53.138
¶ Saints go marchin' in ¶

08:00.046 --> 08:01.346
Pardon me.

08:01.348 --> 08:02.447
Can I ask you a question?

08:02.449 --> 08:05.183
Ask and you shall receive.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.586
If Jesus never wrote
anything down,

08:07.588 --> 08:08.954
which he didn't,

08:08.956 --> 08:10.388
and people didn't start quotin'
him

08:10.390 --> 08:12.791
till hundreds of years
after he died,

08:12.793 --> 08:16.294
then how can you be sure he
d what he was supposed

08:16.296 --> 08:17.162
to have said?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.698
Well, if I understand
your question,

08:19.700 --> 08:22.234
and I think I do, the
answer is I can't.

08:22.236 --> 08:24.736
My question to you, since you
are obviously a

08:24.738 --> 08:25.904
religious scholar,

08:25.906 --> 08:28.306
is how can you be sure he didn't
t?

08:28.308 --> 08:31.476
You got me there.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.511
Here's another weighty one.

08:33.514 --> 08:36.114
Honey orange tangerine

08:36.116 --> 08:37.515
or plum apple purple?

08:37.518 --> 08:40.784
To eat, or to put on your toes?

08:40.787 --> 08:44.054
I'd be happy to provide the
answer you want

08:44.057 --> 08:46.324
in exchange for changing the
radio station.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.627
No, I think I'll paint my
left big toe purple,

08:48.629 --> 08:52.631
and alternate my other toes
orange, purple, orange, purple.

08:52.633 --> 08:53.398
Say what now?

08:53.400 --> 08:55.500
And vice-versa on the
other foot.

08:56.770 --> 08:57.669
Come on.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.604
Change away.

08:59.606 --> 09:00.438
Thank you.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.606
Here on
the final hole

09:01.608 --> 09:03.575
of the City Championship,

09:03.577 --> 09:04.876
tournament leader Augie Baccus

09:04.878 --> 09:07.479
is attempting to play a
ricochet shot

09:07.481 --> 09:10.181
off a tree behind the green.

09:12.518 --> 09:13.418
Whoo!

09:18.858 --> 09:22.327
And now, this
putt for the win.

09:28.000 --> 09:28.900
Oh!

09:30.837 --> 09:32.837
Baby, what's got you all
fired up today?

09:32.839 --> 09:35.774
I think you came in first,
second, and third!

09:35.776 --> 09:38.443
Augie. Augie, hi. Can I have
a word with you?

09:38.445 --> 09:39.578
Sure. Yes, ma'am.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.145
Okay. Hi,

09:40.147 --> 09:41.212
this is Suzi Simmons
reporting live

09:41.214 --> 09:43.815
from the Sure Thing Brake and L
Lube City Championship,

09:43.817 --> 09:47.419
where today Augie Baccus shot a
65 in the morning

09:47.421 --> 09:48.553
to tie the course record,

09:48.555 --> 09:49.788
and in the afternoon, came back

09:49.790 --> 09:53.592
and shot a 63 to break the
course record by two shots.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.594
That's not a typo, folks.

09:55.596 --> 09:56.561
A one-day event,

09:56.563 --> 09:58.597
and this guy shoots
14 under par

09:58.599 --> 10:00.031
and wins by 15 shots.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.900
So, darlin', tell me how
you did that.

10:01.902 --> 10:05.670
Well, uh, three
things actually.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.238
One, hard work,

10:07.240 --> 10:08.506
belief in the Almighty,

10:08.508 --> 10:10.108
and, uh, jaw-droppin' talent

10:10.110 --> 10:12.477
all blended together in
perfect harmony.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.046
Nah, ma'am, I'm just messin'
with you.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.916
Sometimes the good Lord
just blesses you.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.484
Well, he sure
blessed you today.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.752
Thanks for talking with us,
Augie.

10:20.754 --> 10:21.686
Thank you.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.188
Congratulations.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.289
Thank you, ma'am.

10:30.496 --> 10:32.464
Three, two...

10:32.466 --> 10:33.431
One! Go!

10:34.534 --> 10:35.467
Oh, that is me!

10:35.469 --> 10:37.268
That is me again!

10:39.506 --> 10:40.171
Hello!

10:40.173 --> 10:41.339
Keep givin' me quarters!

10:41.341 --> 10:42.507
Keep givin' me quarters!

10:42.509 --> 10:43.308
Anybody here?!

10:43.310 --> 10:44.509
Why do you always
have to cheat?

10:44.511 --> 10:46.511
Well, hey, are you
out of quarters?

10:46.513 --> 10:48.513
Hi! Hello!

10:48.515 --> 10:50.615
Can we get some service here?

10:50.617 --> 10:51.950
You miss out on it.

10:51.952 --> 10:52.751
Shoot!

10:52.753 --> 10:53.985
Okay, here we go. Ready?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.754
Three, two, one. Get
inside the re!

10:57.124 --> 10:58.356
Thank you very much, boys! Oh!

10:58.358 --> 10:59.124
Thank you very much!

10:59.126 --> 11:00.992
Yeah, why don't you just
go cheat again?

11:00.994 --> 11:01.993
Good afternoon.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.695
Hi. Sir, and...

11:03.697 --> 11:04.663
Good afternoon.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.631
Good afternoon to your hat.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.900
You work here?

11:08.902 --> 11:10.602
No, I was just, you know,
stand in' around

11:10.604 --> 11:12.070
and heard you yellin'.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.471
Ah ha!

11:13.473 --> 11:14.606
Okay. So, good.

11:14.608 --> 11:16.441
So where do we go from here?

11:16.443 --> 11:17.942
Well, judgin' from the
looks of things,

11:17.944 --> 11:19.811
you two are not lookin'
for a tee time.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.414
Well, you know, things aren't a
always what they appear to be.

11:22.416 --> 11:23.682
Thank you, ma'am.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.684
I wouldn't have known that if y
you didn't tell me.

11:25.686 --> 11:26.618
Okay, here's the deal.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.386
We were drivin' cross-country.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.220
Heard about that fella

11:29.222 --> 11:30.789
who won the golf
tournament today.

11:30.791 --> 11:31.423
And so?

11:31.425 --> 11:34.292
And so, can
I meet him?

11:34.294 --> 11:35.360
Well, you can pretty much do

11:35.362 --> 11:37.562
whatever you want around here,
mister.

11:37.564 --> 11:38.863
Why do you need to meet him?

11:38.865 --> 11:41.833
Well, I need an answer to a
simple question.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.002
Is he really that good?

11:44.004 --> 11:47.605
In golf, it comes down
to a number.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.674
Can't put any spin on numbers.

11:49.676 --> 11:50.642
They don't lie.

11:50.644 --> 11:51.943
Well, lookee here.

11:51.945 --> 11:55.847
We wouldn't have known that if
you hadn't of told us.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.516
See how beautifully we're
all gettin' along?

11:58.518 --> 12:01.086
Well, look, if he's
that damn good,

12:01.088 --> 12:04.489
his life could change for the
better in a big hurry.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.491
You don't say?

12:06.493 --> 12:07.726
Oh, I do say.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.194
Oh, he says.

12:12.765 --> 12:14.299
All right.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.702
See you on the first tee.

12:17.704 --> 12:20.505
Is that the guy?

12:20.507 --> 12:23.842
Why don't you go find out
for yourself?

12:26.412 --> 12:27.545
Looks like the caddy.

12:44.830 --> 12:47.832
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

12:47.834 --> 12:48.833
Wow.

12:48.835 --> 12:51.402
Yeah, it's not the caddy.

13:09.723 --> 13:10.989
Impressive!

13:10.991 --> 13:12.590
Thank you.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.226
Now, why'd you putt it
with one hand?

13:15.228 --> 13:17.729
Well, uh, sometimes
we want to have

13:17.731 --> 13:18.630
a left-to-right breaking putt.

13:18.632 --> 13:19.697
I like to putt with
my left hand.

13:19.699 --> 13:22.300
Helps me keep my putter
square in line.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.370
I drain it most of the time
doing it that way.

13:25.372 --> 13:26.738
And you knew you were
gonna play

13:26.740 --> 13:27.906
that iron for your second shot?

13:27.908 --> 13:30.341
Yes, sir. Pitching wedge, hard,
medium, soft.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.177
It just depends on how I
catch my tee shot.

13:32.179 --> 13:36.581
Ha! Well, son, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.483
People call me Riverboat.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.450
This here's Jessie.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.352
Most people call her The Bank.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.721
Oh. Well, why they
call you that?

13:43.723 --> 13:45.690
Use your imagination.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.927
Let me cut to the chase here.

13:48.929 --> 13:53.531
Now, I make it my business to
understand odds.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.968
You know, the likelihood
happenin' or not.

13:56.970 --> 13:57.769
Go on.

13:57.771 --> 13:58.970
Well, no offense,

13:58.972 --> 14:02.440
but most people lookin' at you
are not likely to think

14:02.442 --> 14:04.876
you're as good as you
may well be.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.912
I also happen to know
a few fellas

14:07.914 --> 14:09.881
with lots of cash

14:09.883 --> 14:12.283
who wouldn't mind losing it,

14:12.285 --> 14:14.953
provided they had the
right opportunity.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.721
And that might be me?

14:16.723 --> 14:18.523
Might be.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.792
So you're a
professional gambler.

14:20.794 --> 14:22.160
Call it what you like.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.895
And you want me to
play for you?

14:23.897 --> 14:25.763
I got a suspicion you and me

14:25.765 --> 14:27.298
could do some pretty
good damage.

14:27.300 --> 14:31.536
Well, sorry, sir, but I
don't gamble.

14:31.538 --> 14:35.673
Well, all you gotta do is
play golf and win.

14:35.675 --> 14:39.077
Just
collect a share,

14:39.079 --> 14:41.346
that's all.

14:41.348 --> 14:44.782
No, you know, I really
like your name,

14:44.784 --> 14:45.750
uh, Mr. Riverboat.

14:45.752 --> 14:48.953
I really do, but I'm
not your man.

14:48.955 --> 14:50.588
Well, that's too bad.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.690
You see, I got big dreams.

14:52.692 --> 14:53.725
Big dreams,

14:53.727 --> 14:55.526
I just don't see y'all in 'em.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.528
Well, see, I'm the kind of guy

14:57.530 --> 15:00.531
who's in the business of makin'
dreams come true.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.434
That may be the case,
but not mine.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.970
It was really nice to
meet you folks.

15:05.972 --> 15:06.871
Take care.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.106
Okay.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.941
Shoot.

15:15.781 --> 15:16.981
What's that?

15:16.983 --> 15:18.816
"I'm hungry."

15:18.818 --> 15:19.651
You're hungry?

15:19.653 --> 15:21.052
Baby, you just had a big lunch.

15:22.155 --> 15:25.890
No, silly, I'm practicing
like you practice.

15:29.695 --> 15:32.263
I give up.

15:33.833 --> 15:36.801
"I'd like to go to Paris."

15:36.803 --> 15:38.970
You want to take me to Paris?

15:38.972 --> 15:40.605
Paris? Mm-hmm.

15:46.745 --> 15:49.080
I can take you to Paris, baby.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.148
Oh, yeah?

15:50.150 --> 15:53.584
Yeah. I want to be your
passport out of here,

15:53.586 --> 15:54.886
show you the world.

15:58.757 --> 16:00.825
How you gonna do that?

16:00.827 --> 16:06.931
Well, big dreams,
follow and win,

16:06.933 --> 16:08.099
and a little bit of luck.

16:14.673 --> 16:18.276
Let's start with
Paris, Texas, first.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.519
Help us to
do the things we should,

16:28.521 --> 16:30.588
to be to others kind and good.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.490
In all we do, work or play,

16:32.492 --> 16:34.959
to grow more loving every day.
Amen.

16:34.961 --> 16:37.895
Ah! Let's eat. You hungry?

16:37.897 --> 16:39.998
So how many tried out today?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.399
18 girls and one boy.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.835
Oh, well, we got this
in the bag.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.036
How many make the squad?

16:45.038 --> 16:45.903
Eight.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.572
Eight? That's perfect.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.774
All you gotta do is have faith,
baby.

16:49.776 --> 16:50.675
It's yours.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.077
How much is a
cheerleader uniform?

16:53.079 --> 16:54.679
They didn't say.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.547
Mom, I think we can afford

16:56.549 --> 16:59.217
a cheerleading uniform
for Rosie, okay?

16:59.219 --> 17:00.985
No, I know.

17:00.987 --> 17:01.886
She deserves it.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.188
I have faith in you, baby girl.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.356
Jellyfish, pound it!

17:05.358 --> 17:07.224
Pow-wow-wow.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.226
Atta girl.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.997
Want to go to
the range with me tonight?

17:12.999 --> 17:13.998
Sure.

17:14.000 --> 17:14.799
Hit some balls?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.067
Work on your putting stroke?

17:32.117 --> 17:33.951
How was your day, Ray?

17:33.953 --> 17:35.420
So-so.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.922
Trying out for our school
cheer leading squad.

17:37.924 --> 17:39.924
Oh, just what the world needs,

17:39.926 --> 17:41.659
another cheerleader.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.863
What's this supposed to be?

17:45.865 --> 17:47.785
Chicken Enchiladas.
You like it?

17:50.669 --> 17:54.639
And you, son? What'd
you do today?

17:54.641 --> 17:58.543
Worked in the shop, practiced.

17:59.978 --> 18:02.814
Why are you wearing
your hat in side?

18:02.816 --> 18:05.216
It's disrespectful.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.089
Sorry, Mama.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.031
You call this Chicken
Enchilada?

18:20.033 --> 18:21.833
Tastes like chicken shit to me.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.936
Well, you don't have to eat it
if you don't like it!

18:24.938 --> 18:26.237
Says who?

18:26.239 --> 18:27.038
Says me.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.973
Hey, Augie.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.010
Look who's growing some balls.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.046
Mama's little boy.

18:35.048 --> 18:36.914
Come on, show me what you got.

18:36.916 --> 18:40.384
No. No, no! Augie, Augie,
don't, don't!

18:40.386 --> 18:41.285
Get out.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.521
Fine. Hey.

19:17.055 --> 19:18.256
Hey, Rosie.

19:18.258 --> 19:21.225
Hey, it's okay.

19:21.227 --> 19:22.560
I'm sorry.

19:24.129 --> 19:27.098
I love you, okay? I'm sorry.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.133
I'm sorry.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.468
So what you want to do

19:30.470 --> 19:32.336
is you want to dip in the
paint, okay?

19:32.338 --> 19:33.437
Obviously.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.206
Take it and pat it
back like this.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.308
Tap it on that side and the
other side so it doesn't drip.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.643
You see that? Mm-hmm.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.745
What you do is you just
take it up here,

19:40.747 --> 19:44.148
back and forth just like that.

19:44.150 --> 19:47.285
Yep, long strokes,
longer strokes.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.153
Okay. Yeah, there you go.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.155
They pay 7.50 a hour for this?

19:51.157 --> 19:52.023
Yes, ma'am.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.125
Cool. So any tips for
good work?

19:54.127 --> 19:56.994
Sure, I'll give you some tips.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.162
Brush your teeth.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.564
Shower once a day.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.933
Eat your veggies, you
little weakling.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.968
Okay, well, I have
a tip for you.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.070
Smart asses don't make it to
the promised land.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.104
Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.106
You don't think I have a
say in the matter?

20:09.108 --> 20:09.941
You got a say.

20:09.943 --> 20:12.176
I already know what
you're gonna say.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.980
I would say that you are cocky,
arrogant,

20:15.982 --> 20:18.282
and don't appreciate
what you got.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.150
Cocky?

20:19.152 --> 20:20.685
Mm-hmm. I say that
you ought to be

20:20.687 --> 20:22.353
put on rations for a while.

20:22.355 --> 20:23.854
Rations? Mm-hmm.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.691
So, what? Now I gotta beg
for it, huh?

20:26.693 --> 20:28.059
Let's get you off this thing.

20:28.061 --> 20:28.793
Good mornin'!

20:28.795 --> 20:32.997
I heard there was a budding Pi-
Picasso around here,

20:32.999 --> 20:34.465
paintin' his masterpiece.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.800
How'd you find us?

20:35.802 --> 20:39.237
Let's just say I got
my sources.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.738
Well, that's great.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.940
Source that brush over there

20:41.941 --> 20:43.274
and make yourself useful.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.376
I don't do manual
labor anymore.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.677
Neither should you.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.379
Nothin' wrong with
manual labor.

20:48.381 --> 20:51.315
Story of my youth,
little darlin'.

20:51.317 --> 20:54.452
Augie, you interested in
hearing a proposition

20:54.454 --> 20:56.554
that'll pay you more than
paint in' 100 houses?

20:56.556 --> 20:57.655
No, sir.

20:57.657 --> 21:00.024
Be a hell of a lot more fun,
too.

21:00.026 --> 21:00.858
I found this fat cat

21:00.860 --> 21:02.693
who thinks his home
pro can play,

21:02.695 --> 21:05.796
and lucky for us, he's got more
money than brains.

21:05.798 --> 21:06.931
Well, Augie's not interested.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.866
He's gonna make money the
old-fashioned way.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.068
By winning the U.S. Open, hmm?

21:11.070 --> 21:12.403
Damn straight, pretty girl.

21:12.405 --> 21:13.170
Yep.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.840
Well, I hate to differ
with you, kids,

21:15.842 --> 21:19.176
but people been wagerin'
on golf matches

21:19.178 --> 21:22.813
long before there was ever a U.
S. Open.

21:24.750 --> 21:27.918
Well, just out of curiosity,

21:27.920 --> 21:30.821
how much is more than
painting 100 houses?

21:32.691 --> 21:34.625
Ooh...

21:34.627 --> 21:36.527
let's see.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.332
How's that for starters?

21:44.002 --> 21:46.270
It's a thousand dollars.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.108
All I gotta do is play golf?

21:51.110 --> 21:53.744
All you gotta do is play golf.

21:54.479 --> 21:58.182
Today, Beau Rivage,

21:58.184 --> 22:00.418
high noon.

22:07.459 --> 22:08.693
What?

22:09.661 --> 22:11.362
What, babe?

22:11.364 --> 22:14.098
I didn't say yes.

22:17.803 --> 22:19.070
So your boy's so good

22:19.072 --> 22:22.440
that, uh, he don't even have
to warm up, huh?

22:22.442 --> 22:23.607
Apparently not.

22:23.609 --> 22:25.409
What's your game?

22:25.411 --> 22:27.845
$5,000 Nassau.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.948
So we're talking 5,000
on the front,

22:30.950 --> 22:33.017
5,000 on the back, 5,000 on 18.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.352
Press when you're pissed off.

22:34.354 --> 22:35.453
I have that right?

22:35.455 --> 22:37.021
As if you have to ask.

22:43.161 --> 22:45.129
Ah. What is that?

22:47.366 --> 22:48.332
It's my horse.

22:48.334 --> 22:51.268
You gotta be kiddin' me.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.670
Let's see.

22:56.675 --> 22:58.275
Okay.

22:58.277 --> 22:59.710
Augie's here, honey.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.545
What? Okay.

23:06.618 --> 23:08.319
Shot.

23:15.494 --> 23:17.361
Afternoon, Augie.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.878
Oops.

23:37.482 --> 23:38.482
Come on.

23:38.484 --> 23:39.817
Okay.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.196
Oh, my Lord.

24:03.308 --> 24:04.175
Shit.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.411
Good-bye.

24:19.157 --> 24:22.226
2 down after two!

24:22.228 --> 24:24.862
So how's it goin' for you
there, Boat?

24:24.864 --> 24:27.131
We concede. What the
hell you doin'?

24:27.133 --> 24:28.833
I'm playin' golf. What's
it look like?

24:28.835 --> 24:32.169
Hogwash. Get out of your head,
boy.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.405
Temper's instant death in golf.

24:34.407 --> 24:36.740
It's like boxin', right?

24:36.742 --> 24:38.542
Boxer gets mad, gets
too aggressive,

24:38.544 --> 24:40.444
drops his guard, wham!

24:40.446 --> 24:42.546
He's a goner.

24:43.515 --> 24:46.550
God. I hate that fat guy.

24:46.552 --> 24:47.451
Listen to me.

24:47.453 --> 24:49.620
Can you handle this,
or can't you?

24:49.622 --> 24:52.256
Yeah, I can handle it.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.305
Shot.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.498
Ha! Whoo!

25:37.035 --> 25:38.636
That's the shot!

25:38.638 --> 25:41.105
Augie! Yeah!

25:41.107 --> 25:43.040
That's it right there.

25:49.515 --> 25:50.481
Okay, son.

25:50.483 --> 25:52.816
We're 1 up on the last hole.

25:52.818 --> 25:55.219
You just nestle that
little sucker

25:55.221 --> 25:56.520
right up there next to the jar

25:56.522 --> 25:58.889
and we waltz home smilin'.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.691
Yes, sir.

26:07.032 --> 26:07.765
Go.

26:07.767 --> 26:08.866
Ha ha!

26:08.868 --> 26:10.534
Get legs.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.202
Oh, yes!

26:12.204 --> 26:15.606
And so the pro goes to a
watery grave!

26:15.608 --> 26:17.341
Augie, listen to me.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.909
Augie, hey, listen.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.311
Listen here.

26:20.313 --> 26:21.145
All you gotta do...

26:21.147 --> 26:24.615
All you gotta do is hit
it over that H20

26:24.617 --> 26:25.749
right up on the green

26:25.751 --> 26:27.718
and snatch victory from the
jaw s of the defeat.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.420
All right, now don't screw
it up, all right?

26:29.422 --> 26:31.455
All right, all right.
You can d o it.

26:31.457 --> 26:33.757
Shh, shh,
shh!

26:33.759 --> 26:34.892
Bring it home!

26:34.894 --> 26:36.293
Shh! Shh!

26:47.539 --> 26:49.673
Augie! Come on!

26:49.675 --> 26:51.609
Yes! Whoo!

26:51.611 --> 26:52.543
Whoo!

26:52.545 --> 26:54.912
That's my boy!

26:54.914 --> 26:56.614
So, you concede?

26:56.616 --> 26:57.781
Match ends all square.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.617
Worst possible outcome.

26:59.619 --> 27:03.721
Gentlemen, play one more hole?

27:03.723 --> 27:06.523
Winner takes all?

27:06.525 --> 27:08.125
One hole for 15 Gs?

27:08.693 --> 27:10.461
I don't know. You game?

27:10.463 --> 27:13.664
I don't know. Am I?

27:24.242 --> 27:26.710
Oh!

27:26.712 --> 27:28.245
Baby.

27:28.247 --> 27:30.080
That's good.

27:33.652 --> 27:34.718
Shall we try it?

27:34.720 --> 27:36.420
Might as well.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.558
Hey, can I bum that cigarette?

27:41.560 --> 27:43.260
Shouldn't be smokin'.

27:43.262 --> 27:44.428
It's bad for your health.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.563
What are they doin'?

27:46.565 --> 27:48.232
Never seen it before,

27:48.234 --> 27:51.068
but it's hard to read the break
of a putt in the dark,

27:51.070 --> 27:52.670
so she's probably placing
that cigarette

27:52.672 --> 27:55.372
at the point where he's gotta h
hit it to make it.

27:58.576 --> 28:00.210
And that's fair?

28:00.212 --> 28:03.047
Since when you
worried about fair?

28:15.060 --> 28:16.894
Yes! Whoo!

28:16.896 --> 28:18.262
Augie! Ha!

28:19.130 --> 28:21.932
I don't think that that
exactly complies

28:21.934 --> 28:26.270
with the rules of the United St
States Golf Association.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.539
Well, who said anything
about rules?

28:28.541 --> 28:32.910
This is real golf played
by real people.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.746
I don't ever want to see your s
sorry-ass face around

28:35.748 --> 28:36.613
here again.

28:36.615 --> 28:37.981
You understand me?

28:37.983 --> 28:39.750
Not a problem.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.118
Oh, yeah, real quick.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.620
Your name is Tuffy? Is
that right?

28:43.622 --> 28:44.788
Yeah.

28:44.790 --> 28:47.458
Now, why is that?

28:47.460 --> 28:49.493
I'll show you why, you
son of a bitch.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.662
Now, that was fun,
right?

28:51.664 --> 28:53.163
Had more fun in a
dentist's chair.

28:53.165 --> 28:56.633
Well, maybe this will take
some of the sting

28:56.635 --> 28:57.501
out of it, darlin'.

28:57.503 --> 29:02.473
Augie, this is your share of
to day's winnings.

29:02.475 --> 29:05.509
Plus, a little down payment
on your future.

29:05.511 --> 29:09.213
Now, this is cold, hard, U.S.
o f A. currency.

29:09.215 --> 29:12.449
You can stick it right straight
into your britches,

29:12.451 --> 29:15.219
and Uncle Sam will never know
t he difference.

29:16.454 --> 29:19.289
How do you
sleep at night?

29:19.291 --> 29:22.826
Like a baby after sucking on
hi s mama's tit.

29:22.828 --> 29:23.727
Ha ha!

29:23.729 --> 29:24.928
We'll see you around.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.029
Good job, baby.

29:26.031 --> 29:27.831
Thank you, ma'am.

29:29.634 --> 29:30.434
Just like that,

29:30.436 --> 29:33.904
he signs a deal with the devil.

29:33.906 --> 29:36.240
Nice goin', Augie.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.653
Mmm.

29:49.655 --> 29:52.689
Robbed a bank today, ladies.

29:52.691 --> 29:55.659
Ten freshly minted $100 bills.

29:55.661 --> 29:58.362
Pay for gas, food, rent,
whatever you want,

29:58.364 --> 30:01.799
and, Mama, please, please buy
you something, okay?

30:01.801 --> 30:03.700
Buy something nice.

30:03.702 --> 30:06.804
Augie, where did you get this?

30:06.806 --> 30:07.805
Playin' golf.

30:07.807 --> 30:10.674
I won it fair and square.

30:10.676 --> 30:11.809
Oh...

30:11.811 --> 30:15.145
Rosie, got somethin' for you.

30:21.019 --> 30:23.720
Mama! Mama! Look!

30:23.722 --> 30:25.656
My cheerleading uniform!

30:25.658 --> 30:28.525
You like it? Yeah?

30:28.527 --> 30:29.593
Look what's in there!

30:29.595 --> 30:32.062
There's more! Yeah?

30:32.064 --> 30:32.763
Ohh!

30:32.765 --> 30:34.798
Do you like it, baby girl? Huh?

30:34.800 --> 30:35.666
Do you like it?

30:35.668 --> 30:36.800
Well, go try it on.

30:36.802 --> 30:39.002
Go try it on.

30:41.906 --> 30:44.241
Augie? Hmm?

30:46.678 --> 30:48.846
Mama, it's yours.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.751
Now,
first thing is,

30:54.753 --> 30:55.853
this ain't no U.S. Open,

30:55.855 --> 30:57.788
which means you can
move your b all

30:57.790 --> 30:59.189
even if it's in the rough,

30:59.191 --> 31:00.691
'cause most players
do it anyway,

31:00.693 --> 31:02.326
and since I'm doin' the
talking here,

31:02.328 --> 31:04.561
I'll go ahead and call
the first game.

31:04.563 --> 31:05.662
It'll be Lakewood,

31:05.664 --> 31:08.065
better known as
Screaming Jesus,

31:08.067 --> 31:09.600
which for those who are unwashed
d and uninitiated,

31:09.602 --> 31:11.768
that means that you can do
absolutely anything

31:11.770 --> 31:13.537
on God's green earth to
your opponent,

31:13.539 --> 31:15.372
Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.740
Enough of the bullshit,
Little John.

31:16.742 --> 31:17.741
Let's play golf. Let's go.

31:17.743 --> 31:18.942
$1,000 a hole, three ways?

31:18.944 --> 31:20.878
Low ball wins.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.846
You boys bring plenty of cash?

31:22.848 --> 31:25.716
Does an armadillo have balls?

31:25.718 --> 31:28.552
I actually don't know. Does he?

31:28.554 --> 31:30.120
Can we get this thing started,
please?

31:30.122 --> 31:32.055
Step back. Give the boy a
lil peace and quiet, please.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.258
So you can scream?

31:35.693 --> 31:37.060
Hey! Hey! Hey!

31:37.062 --> 31:38.195
Ball.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.463
Nice hit,
my friend.

31:39.465 --> 31:40.664
Good ball. Good ball.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.466
I didn't see it.
Did you see it?

31:42.468 --> 31:43.567
Oh, it's way down there!

31:43.569 --> 31:44.868
It's way down there.

31:44.870 --> 31:47.070
I'm gonna take your... I'm gonna
take your tees, John Tom.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.739
You can do
whatever you like, son.

31:48.741 --> 31:49.773
All right, here we go.

31:49.775 --> 31:51.541
Come on, Augie.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.977
Y'all just keep your
mouth shut.

32:00.920 --> 32:01.852
Excuse us, gentlemen.

32:01.854 --> 32:03.654
Yeah, I'll take that.

32:03.656 --> 32:04.688
We'll eat that up.

32:04.690 --> 32:05.856
Show 'em what you got, baby.

32:05.858 --> 32:07.424
Show 'em what you got.

32:07.426 --> 32:08.859
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
who a!

32:08.861 --> 32:10.227
Where y'all goin'?

32:10.229 --> 32:11.795
We ain't stoppin'
any body!

32:11.797 --> 32:13.997
We ain't gonna interfere
with anybody!

32:13.999 --> 32:15.165
Hit them. Hit them.

32:15.167 --> 32:16.967
Don't even worry about
the fair way.

32:16.969 --> 32:19.403
Yeah! Get outta here!

32:19.405 --> 32:21.138
Oh! Ho!

32:26.210 --> 32:27.844
That's a tough one
, double breaker.

32:27.846 --> 32:29.146
Hey, tie your shoe, Augie.

32:29.148 --> 32:30.647
Look at my putter. Lo
ok at my putter, Augie!

32:30.649 --> 32:32.616
Look at my putter! Now
look at my hand!

32:32.618 --> 32:33.951
Which one are you
supposed to look at?

32:33.953 --> 32:35.652
Oh, no! What are you...

32:36.754 --> 32:38.055
Oh!

32:38.057 --> 32:39.990
Whoo! Yes!

32:39.992 --> 32:41.191
Smooth, baby.

32:41.893 --> 32:42.893
All right,
John Tom.

32:42.895 --> 32:44.027
Just concentrate there, man.

32:44.029 --> 32:45.862
Putter getting hot?

32:45.864 --> 32:46.830
Don't look at this.

32:46.832 --> 32:47.965
Don't look at this. Look
at your ball.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.866
Look at your ball.

32:49.868 --> 32:53.003
Whoo!

32:53.005 --> 32:53.704
Blanks!

32:55.741 --> 32:57.074
Jessie, baby, do the honors.

32:57.076 --> 33:00.644
Man, that's crazy!
He has a gun?

33:00.646 --> 33:01.646
Really, Riverboat?

33:03.915 --> 33:05.549
Petit Jean, thank you, doll.

33:05.551 --> 33:08.986
Get me some of them
red-bottom shoes.

33:15.626 --> 33:19.529
So, Riverboat, you're
a man of action.

33:19.531 --> 33:22.632
Let's have a little action,
huh?

33:22.634 --> 33:24.901
Let's bet I can put
this on the green

33:24.903 --> 33:25.902
with this here putter.

33:25.904 --> 33:27.471
Say what?

33:27.473 --> 33:29.706
What part of that didn't
you understand?

33:29.708 --> 33:31.041
With your putter?

33:31.043 --> 33:31.842
With my putter.

33:31.844 --> 33:35.812
I can tell you right now,
I'll take that bet.

33:35.814 --> 33:37.981
How sure are we?

33:37.983 --> 33:39.750
Pretty damn sure.

33:39.752 --> 33:43.153
Okay, thrill-seekers. Side bet.

33:43.155 --> 33:46.623
2 grand says that Augie
cannot put that ball

33:46.625 --> 33:49.493
on that green with that putter.

33:50.728 --> 33:52.996
Honey, we down with this?

33:52.998 --> 33:54.998
No guts, no glory.

33:57.001 --> 33:58.735
Good luck.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.216
That's
gonna make it!

34:13.217 --> 34:14.051
Oh-ho!

34:14.053 --> 34:16.319
Oh, baby! Ho!

34:16.321 --> 34:17.120
Bam!

34:17.121 --> 34:19.356
$2,000, please!

34:19.358 --> 34:21.525
Congratulations.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.960
Whoo!

34:23.962 --> 34:26.996
John Tom, we still got 2
grand on this hole

34:26.998 --> 34:27.998
from the original bet.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.498
I want you to pretend

34:29.501 --> 34:31.735
like you're Tiger Woods
at the Masters

34:31.737 --> 34:33.070
and ram that sucker in the jar.

34:33.072 --> 34:35.272
Guarantee Augie will miss.

34:39.143 --> 34:40.976
There it is. Come on, baby.

34:40.978 --> 34:43.080
Come on for papa! Come on!

34:43.081 --> 34:45.916
Come on! No, John Tom!

34:45.918 --> 34:47.250
I'd rather stick my arm

34:47.252 --> 34:49.319
in the south end of an angry
bull headin' north

34:49.321 --> 34:50.954
than for you to leave
that putt short!

34:50.956 --> 34:54.357
I'll tell you what, Little
John, calm down.

34:54.359 --> 34:58.028
I'll let you buy this putt right
here for $1,000.

34:58.030 --> 35:01.198
And sacrifice my manhood
in the process?

35:01.200 --> 35:02.632
No, thank you.

35:02.634 --> 35:03.934
Augie, do what you gotta do.

35:03.936 --> 35:06.103
Ah ha. All right, Augie.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.047
Yeah! Olé!

35:17.049 --> 35:18.548
Come on!

35:19.250 --> 35:20.784
Love that, baby.

35:26.157 --> 35:28.291
No, no, no, no!

35:28.293 --> 35:31.161
I hate golf!

35:36.168 --> 35:38.468
That's unfortunate.

35:39.437 --> 35:41.371
Oh, no.

35:41.373 --> 35:43.240
Oh! Oh!

35:46.611 --> 35:49.112
Pleasure doing business
with you, baby.

35:49.114 --> 35:51.181
I wish I could say the same.

35:51.183 --> 35:53.183
Okay, come here.

35:53.185 --> 35:54.351
I got you.

35:59.223 --> 36:01.158
I love this game.

36:01.160 --> 36:06.163
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco,
seis,

36:06.165 --> 36:09.533
7, 8, 9, 10 Benjamins.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.568
Don't spend it all in one
place, baby.

36:11.570 --> 36:12.936
Oh, don't you worry about that.

36:12.938 --> 36:13.837
Siete, darlin'.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.105
I know. It's just it
doesn't rhyme.

36:15.107 --> 36:17.174
That's why I always forget it.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.074
So where's your girlfriend?

36:18.076 --> 36:20.010
She's missin' out on
all the fun.

36:20.012 --> 36:21.077
Oh, she, uh...

36:21.079 --> 36:22.612
She's taking French classes.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.548
She really wants to
go to Paris.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.883
Something about a past life
attraction or something.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.718
Too bad she's not a
little more obsessed

36:28.720 --> 36:31.521
with makin' money in this life.

36:31.989 --> 36:34.090
So, Riverboat, what got
you caught up

36:34.092 --> 36:35.325
in all this racket anyway?

36:35.327 --> 36:38.328
Well, now...

36:38.330 --> 36:40.797
Well, when I was a kid,

36:40.799 --> 36:42.966
I was pretty good at pitchin'
horseshoes.

36:42.968 --> 36:45.302
One day after I got
whipped pretty good

36:45.304 --> 36:47.103
for the few dollars I had,

36:47.105 --> 36:48.838
I discovered the son of a bitch

36:48.840 --> 36:53.376
had moved the pitch back one
foot, 41 feet.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.947
I tracked his sorry ass down

36:56.949 --> 36:58.048
and asked for my money back.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.016
You should have kicked his ass.

37:00.018 --> 37:03.019
Yeah, well, I did get
my money back.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.088
And then he taught me
some things

37:05.090 --> 37:08.058
much more valuable than money.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.492
What's that?

37:09.494 --> 37:10.827
Well...

37:10.829 --> 37:15.265
Uh, see that watermelon
over there?

37:15.267 --> 37:16.466
Yeah.

37:16.468 --> 37:19.069
Now, what are the odds
that you could

37:19.071 --> 37:22.172
pitch one of these cards
across the room

37:22.174 --> 37:24.941
and have it stick in
that melon?

37:24.943 --> 37:27.777
I would say the odds are pretty
good it can't be done.

37:27.779 --> 37:30.947
Okay. Stick one of
them $100 bills

37:30.949 --> 37:32.415
you just won on that table.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.085
Ahem.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.220
By The Bank, baby.

37:37.222 --> 37:38.588
You ready?

37:40.224 --> 37:42.325
Ready?

37:42.327 --> 37:45.262
Ha!

37:45.264 --> 37:46.296
Oh!

37:46.298 --> 37:47.497
Wow!

37:47.499 --> 37:50.300
See, if you try to pitch it nor
mal like a baseball,

37:50.302 --> 37:51.701
won't stick,

37:51.703 --> 37:54.137
but if you pull it back
by your wrist

37:54.139 --> 37:56.206
and then fling it out
backwards,

37:56.208 --> 37:57.941
it generates more velocity.

37:57.943 --> 38:01.511
Card flies sure and
straight and...

38:02.980 --> 38:05.749
Holy shit!

38:05.751 --> 38:06.316
Wow!

38:06.318 --> 38:08.084
Sticks in there.

38:09.187 --> 38:11.254
Thats... That's magic!

38:11.256 --> 38:13.723
Yeah, well, the art of gamblin'

38:13.725 --> 38:17.394
is to make the other guy think
it is what it appears to be

38:17.396 --> 38:20.297
when you've made damn good
and sure it's not.

38:20.299 --> 38:22.966
So it never is what it seems.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.468
Never. Or near enough never.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.837
Boy, you sure like to live the
hustle, Mr. Riverboat.

38:27.839 --> 38:31.574
Oh, he'd rather be
buried alive six feet under

38:31.576 --> 38:34.110
in a cement casket with a bet h
e couldn't get out

38:34.112 --> 38:35.378
than live a day without
some action.

38:35.380 --> 38:36.813
All right!

38:36.815 --> 38:38.782
All right, show's over,
folks.

38:38.784 --> 38:41.084
Best
dinner I ever had.

38:44.455 --> 38:45.622
Raymond!

38:45.624 --> 38:47.324
Augie! Augie, come
quick! It's Mama!

38:47.326 --> 38:48.425
Raymond, get!

38:48.427 --> 38:49.559
He's hurting Mama!

38:49.561 --> 38:50.460
Come quick, Augie!

38:53.065 --> 38:53.930
Mommy!

38:53.932 --> 38:55.265
Morgan! Morgan, he's back!

38:57.069 --> 38:59.402
Hey! Get off of her!

38:59.404 --> 39:00.337
Get off of her!

39:00.339 --> 39:03.406
Mama, get her out of here and l
lock the door! Hurry!

39:03.408 --> 39:05.408
We stay together!

39:05.410 --> 39:06.142
Go!

39:06.144 --> 39:08.278
You ungrateful woman!

39:08.280 --> 39:08.912
I got my rights!

39:08.914 --> 39:10.980
You have no rights in this
house! Now get out!

39:10.982 --> 39:12.582
Who's gonna pay the bills, you?

39:12.584 --> 39:15.218
Who in their right mind's gonna
want to take care of...

39:15.220 --> 39:16.386
We don't need your damn money!

39:16.388 --> 39:17.754
Now get outta here!

39:19.423 --> 39:20.990
All right.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.395
All right, you want
me to leave?

39:25.397 --> 39:27.097
Yeah.

39:27.099 --> 39:29.466
I'll leave! Huh?

39:29.468 --> 39:31.368
Get out of here!

39:31.370 --> 39:32.569
Augie!

39:34.271 --> 39:37.073
Not so fast, Raymond.

39:37.075 --> 39:37.807
Now, we got a call

39:37.809 --> 39:39.342
about a domestic disturbance
at this address.

39:39.344 --> 39:42.112
I don't suppose you know
anything about that, do you?

39:42.114 --> 39:44.247
You leave this house
before I s ay,

39:44.249 --> 39:46.383
you'll regret you did.

39:47.251 --> 39:50.353
Now, who you suppose
did all this?

39:51.722 --> 39:53.590
I'm sorry this happened to you,
Bethie.

39:53.592 --> 39:55.759
Very sorry.

39:57.762 --> 40:00.363
You know what, Raymond?
You're under arrest.

40:00.365 --> 40:02.999
Consider this your Miranda.

40:04.336 --> 40:05.969
Come on.

40:22.920 --> 40:23.920
¶ To hear it told ¶

40:23.922 --> 40:27.657
¶ I am the man of the hour ¶

40:31.962 --> 40:37.033
¶ But my hold is
starting to slip ¶

40:43.674 --> 40:45.442
Whoo! Ha!

40:45.444 --> 40:46.543
Yeah!

40:48.045 --> 40:49.813
Come on!

40:49.815 --> 40:52.282
Where'd you learn to hit
it like that?

40:52.284 --> 40:53.116
Jack Nicklaus.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.517
I always try to do what he did

40:54.519 --> 40:56.619
just the way he did it.

40:58.522 --> 40:59.122
Hoo!

40:59.124 --> 41:02.258
And I assume you can hit
all the shots...

41:02.260 --> 41:05.562
cuts and draws in bunches.

41:14.405 --> 41:16.506
My Lord.

41:16.508 --> 41:18.274
Whoo-hoo!

41:20.378 --> 41:21.411
See you later.

41:21.413 --> 41:22.479
See you later.

41:26.617 --> 41:31.855
¶ But I suspect that my
enemies are plotting ¶

41:40.965 --> 41:42.799
Hey.

41:45.804 --> 41:47.837
Is there no place to
hide from you?

41:47.839 --> 41:50.173
Sorry to disturb, little
darlin '. My bad.

41:50.175 --> 41:53.476
But I thought you wouldn't
mind for this.

41:57.848 --> 41:59.215
Listen, partner,

41:59.217 --> 42:00.884
we done worn out our
welcome around here.

42:00.886 --> 42:03.720
It's time to move on to
greener pastures.

42:05.456 --> 42:07.156
Las Vegas, baby.

42:08.492 --> 42:10.293
Where the big fish swim.

42:10.295 --> 42:12.629
Along with every shark
known to man.

42:12.631 --> 42:16.499
To kill a shark, all you need t
to do is think like a shark.

42:16.501 --> 42:18.368
Darlin', this ain't no time

42:18.370 --> 42:20.570
to walk away from a winnin'
hand.

42:20.572 --> 42:22.038
How much could I make?

42:23.040 --> 42:24.173
Why don't we put it this way?

42:24.175 --> 42:26.442
You come to Vegas, you
play half decent,

42:26.444 --> 42:28.912
can stand the heat in
the kitchen?

42:28.914 --> 42:32.348
You'll make $100,000
guaranteed.

42:32.350 --> 42:33.449
$100,000?

42:33.451 --> 42:34.384
Cash money.

42:34.386 --> 42:35.952
And about how much
will you make?

42:35.954 --> 42:38.454
Enough to make it
worth my while.

42:38.456 --> 42:41.824
Baby, I never been to Vegas.

42:41.826 --> 42:44.294
Well, you never been to hell,
either.

42:44.296 --> 42:46.329
About time you came.

42:46.331 --> 42:48.064
Great city.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.465
Entertainment capital
of the world.

42:49.467 --> 42:51.334
Will you excuse me?

42:51.336 --> 42:53.136
Have a pleasant evening.

42:54.805 --> 42:57.273
My daddy always said you fly
with the crows,

42:57.275 --> 42:59.375
you get shot with the crows.

42:59.377 --> 43:01.644
Babe, where you going?

43:01.646 --> 43:04.147
Hey, Natalie?

43:09.620 --> 43:11.054
Natalie.

43:19.497 --> 43:21.497
You goin' my way, gorgeous?

43:21.499 --> 43:23.032
Get lost.

43:24.768 --> 43:27.036
Come on, Natalie. Look,
you had your fun.

43:27.038 --> 43:30.073
I don't even recognize you
anymore, Augie.

43:30.708 --> 43:32.208
Natalie, look at me.

43:32.210 --> 43:35.311
There are things that you
don't know, okay?

43:35.313 --> 43:36.679
Okay, here's what I do know.

43:36.681 --> 43:39.415
I know that if you don't care a
bout your own damn dreams,

43:39.417 --> 43:41.684
how can you care about
your girlfriend's

43:41.686 --> 43:45.188
or anything else in your whole
damn life you pretend to love?

43:49.059 --> 43:49.959
Natalie.

43:51.696 --> 43:53.129
Natalie?

43:56.600 --> 43:57.734
Hey.

43:58.569 --> 44:01.504
Natalie? Natalie.

44:01.506 --> 44:02.605
Knock it off.

44:02.607 --> 44:04.240
I need you to be my
friend right now.

44:04.242 --> 44:06.442
Okay. You want me to be
your friend?

44:06.444 --> 44:10.513
Follow your heart, baby,
not your wallet.

44:10.515 --> 44:12.749
Hey, did you know that
Lee Trevino

44:12.751 --> 44:15.718
and Raymond Floyd played in big
- Time money matches?

44:15.720 --> 44:18.688
Lee Trevino.

44:18.690 --> 44:20.123
Okay, Augie.

44:21.692 --> 44:23.793
You walk this path...

44:24.728 --> 44:27.730
and you walk it without me.

44:27.732 --> 44:29.232
No, listen.

44:32.136 --> 44:34.904
I need to tell you something.

44:34.906 --> 44:36.472
Look at me.

44:36.474 --> 44:38.975
I need for you to listen, okay?

44:38.977 --> 44:42.712
Afterwards, you can do whatever
the hell you gotta do.

44:42.714 --> 44:44.747
Just listen.

44:46.550 --> 44:48.751
Well, this better be good.

44:53.290 --> 44:55.992
I haven't told this to anybody.

44:58.028 --> 44:59.429
One night, when I was
coming ho me

44:59.431 --> 45:02.331
from basketball practice in
high school...

45:04.168 --> 45:07.370
I heard a baby crying
in a dumpster.

45:09.873 --> 45:14.577
I opened it up and there was
this little girl.

45:14.579 --> 45:19.148
And I picked her up,
and I held her.

45:20.651 --> 45:22.852
I didn't know what to do.

45:24.421 --> 45:26.656
And I took her home,

45:26.658 --> 45:29.592
and I handed her to my mom,

45:29.594 --> 45:33.429
and she held her like her own.

45:34.531 --> 45:37.066
And we called the
police stations.

45:37.068 --> 45:42.672
We called the TV stations and
t he newspapers,

45:42.674 --> 45:44.607
and no one claimed her.

45:44.609 --> 45:47.710
She wasn't missing. She
was abandoned.

45:51.115 --> 45:52.115
Rosie?

45:52.117 --> 45:53.549
Yeah, Rosie.

45:53.551 --> 45:56.719
I wanted to give her a
decent life,

45:56.721 --> 45:59.021
and that's what we're doin'.

46:00.457 --> 46:03.760
We'll tell her someday
when she 's older.

46:04.595 --> 46:08.464
But I gotta get my
family and you,

46:08.466 --> 46:12.835
I gotta get us out of this
sorry-ass life.

46:12.837 --> 46:17.640
Babe, look, you're doin' it
for the right cause,

46:17.642 --> 46:20.343
but it's not the
right solution.

46:21.478 --> 46:24.947
But there ain't nobody else.

46:25.983 --> 46:30.620
I'm just sayin' Riverboat is no
the answer, okay?

46:30.622 --> 46:32.722
He's a one-way ticket to hell.

46:32.724 --> 46:35.925
Is your soul judged for that?

46:37.361 --> 46:40.363
All right, you know what?

46:40.365 --> 46:43.933
I know I can't talk
you out of this,

46:43.935 --> 46:48.538
so you go do whatever it is the
hell you gotta do.

46:48.540 --> 46:51.407
But when you think about this 2
0 years from now,

46:51.409 --> 46:54.477
just remember you did this to
yourself, okay?

47:19.236 --> 47:22.605
¶ Drivin' down a lonely road ¶

47:22.607 --> 47:25.708
¶ Seein' my head explode ¶

47:25.710 --> 47:28.978
¶ Tryin' to snuff
out the fear ¶

47:31.281 --> 47:34.350
¶ Runnin' from the man inside ¶

47:34.352 --> 47:36.986
¶ Runnin' from my
father's pride ¶

47:36.988 --> 47:41.057
¶ Runnin' with my girl
by my side ¶

47:46.496 --> 47:49.866
Flippity-flop,
gents.

47:49.868 --> 47:50.933
Check.

47:50.935 --> 47:52.568
Check.

47:52.570 --> 47:56.205
Cost you $5,000 to play, boys.

47:56.207 --> 47:57.406
I fold.

47:57.408 --> 47:59.328
My
sentiments exactly.

48:00.544 --> 48:04.981
Well, I can't let you have
all the fun. Call.

48:05.816 --> 48:08.885
Turn.

48:08.887 --> 48:09.986
Sure.

48:09.988 --> 48:12.822
Bet is 20 Gs.

48:12.824 --> 48:16.926
Ooh, bold, decisive,
aggressive.

48:16.928 --> 48:19.929
I like that in a man.

48:20.898 --> 48:21.931
Call.

48:21.933 --> 48:24.834
River card, ladies.

48:24.836 --> 48:27.236
Bam! King of diamonds.

48:27.238 --> 48:28.738
Poker time.

48:28.740 --> 48:31.941
Possible straight,
possible flu sh.

48:35.445 --> 48:38.981
I don't think you got the
goods, my friend.

48:40.851 --> 48:43.019
$50,000 finds out.

48:44.855 --> 48:47.390
On the other hand, you might ha
have kings tucked under there.

48:47.392 --> 48:52.995
Mm-hmm. Well, how curious
are you to find out?

48:52.997 --> 48:54.864
Curious enough.

48:54.866 --> 48:58.768
I will see your 50,

48:58.770 --> 49:01.170
and bump it to 100.

49:02.506 --> 49:03.472
Didn't your mama ever teach you

49:03.474 --> 49:07.176
that it's impolite to wear
a ha t indoors?

49:09.480 --> 49:11.280
Didn't your mama teach
you it's impolite

49:11.282 --> 49:13.649
to ask a stranger an
impolite question?

49:13.651 --> 49:15.785
Well, she obviously

49:15.787 --> 49:17.520
never taught you that's
it impolite

49:17.522 --> 49:20.923
to answer a question
with a question.

49:29.666 --> 49:31.834
And I raise you another 100.

49:36.306 --> 49:38.207
Call.

49:44.715 --> 49:47.950
Uno king.

49:47.952 --> 49:51.053
Tres hombres, kings. Ai!

49:59.463 --> 50:02.965
Ooh, diamonds are a g
girl's best friend.

50:02.967 --> 50:06.268
Oh, Ty-D-Bol, flush time.

50:07.605 --> 50:10.006
So the flush beats three kings.

50:10.008 --> 50:12.441
I know what it beats.

50:13.010 --> 50:14.977
What are the odds on that?

50:14.979 --> 50:17.046
About five to one.

50:17.048 --> 50:19.715
You wouldn't be cheatin' me,
would you, friend?

50:19.717 --> 50:22.985
I take it you're not serious
out that question.

50:22.987 --> 50:25.788
Like a heart attack.

50:25.790 --> 50:27.056
Tell you what.

50:27.058 --> 50:28.324
Since you're so stressed out

50:28.326 --> 50:31.460
about someone cheatin' you, how
about we cut cards?

50:31.462 --> 50:33.796
No possible cheatin' in that.

50:33.798 --> 50:36.632
You just can't get enough of
my money, can you?

50:36.634 --> 50:37.867
Only if you're in the mood.

50:37.869 --> 50:39.135
I'm always in the mood.

50:39.137 --> 50:42.138
You call the stakes.

50:42.873 --> 50:46.075
How much you figure you
got over there?

50:46.077 --> 50:49.578
450,000, give or take.

50:49.580 --> 50:52.448
Well, I guess 450,000 it is.

50:55.085 --> 50:57.319
All right.

50:58.588 --> 51:00.089
That look all right to you?

51:00.091 --> 51:01.824
Looks real good.

51:04.094 --> 51:05.828
Be my guest.

51:13.036 --> 51:15.504
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

51:15.506 --> 51:19.008
Jumpin' Jack from
the house of spades.

51:19.010 --> 51:21.110
Nice draw.

51:21.112 --> 51:21.677
Ooh!

51:21.679 --> 51:22.812
Want to buy off the hand?

51:22.814 --> 51:24.346
Nah, you would not
respect a ma n

51:24.348 --> 51:27.083
who turned tail and ran, now,
would you?

51:44.067 --> 51:45.868
Lord, Lord.

51:47.337 --> 51:49.271
Oh!

51:49.273 --> 51:51.140
Look at that.

51:51.142 --> 51:54.243
Queen just beats that Jack.

51:54.245 --> 51:55.845
Must be my lucky day.

51:59.116 --> 52:00.883
Comin' right up.

52:07.390 --> 52:08.591
Oh, hey there.

52:08.593 --> 52:10.893
I'm sorry. Must be the
wrong suite.

52:10.895 --> 52:11.961
Right suite, right time.

52:11.963 --> 52:14.497
Step right this way,
sweetheart.

52:15.499 --> 52:17.600
You can put these over here,
baby, right here.

52:17.602 --> 52:24.206
Okay. Uh, hey, fellas. I got me
meatball and, uh, some veggies

52:24.208 --> 52:26.775
for those of you who want to
lo se some weight.

52:26.777 --> 52:30.546
How about we try a
little Omaha?

52:30.548 --> 52:32.681
Oh, now, now, come on now,
brother.

52:32.683 --> 52:35.951
We been playing cards for 10
hours straight.

52:35.953 --> 52:38.954
Man's gotta stretch his bones,

52:38.956 --> 52:39.989
eat sometime.

52:39.991 --> 52:43.192
Don't ever call me
brother again.

52:45.128 --> 52:46.395
All right.

52:46.397 --> 52:49.198
I want to be a
gentleman about this.

52:49.200 --> 52:54.069
Now, give you a sportin' chance
to get your money back.

52:54.071 --> 52:56.138
Yeah? What do you got in mind?

52:56.140 --> 52:58.040
Well, how about we
change venue s?

52:58.042 --> 52:59.542
Settle this at a pool table

52:59.544 --> 53:02.578
or a racetrack or a
golf course?

53:03.713 --> 53:06.115
This is Las Vegas, my friend.

53:06.117 --> 53:07.216
Pool takes too long.

53:07.218 --> 53:09.118
We don't deal with animals.

53:09.120 --> 53:11.120
They don't listen to reason.

53:11.122 --> 53:12.688
Suit yourself.

53:12.690 --> 53:14.056
You know somebody around here

53:14.058 --> 53:15.824
who's pretty good at
playing golf?

53:15.826 --> 53:18.427
You bring your fast gun,
I bring mine.

53:18.429 --> 53:21.430
Hmm. Who you got?

53:23.233 --> 53:25.234
Hey, you!

53:26.703 --> 53:27.770
Me?

53:27.772 --> 53:30.239
Yeah, you. You play golf?

53:30.241 --> 53:31.273
Yeah.

53:31.275 --> 53:33.008
You any good?

53:33.010 --> 53:34.176
I'm okay.

53:34.178 --> 53:36.145
You ever play in competitions?

53:36.147 --> 53:37.213
Back in high school.

53:37.215 --> 53:39.181
You win?

53:39.183 --> 53:39.882
Well, uh,

53:39.884 --> 53:41.817
you know, I'm a little modest
t o say who won,

53:41.819 --> 53:45.020
but, uh, I will tell you that
t he others lost.

53:45.022 --> 53:47.723
Ha! That's good enough for me.

53:47.725 --> 53:51.060
See, I have to give my new
friend here a cinch bet.

53:51.062 --> 53:53.329
You free for some fun
in the sun?

53:53.331 --> 53:57.266
Yeah. What I gotta do?

53:57.268 --> 53:58.968
Just play 18 holes of golf

53:58.970 --> 54:01.870
and try as hard as you can.

54:01.872 --> 54:03.405
Sounds good. I just, uh...

54:03.407 --> 54:04.840
I gotta be done by 6:00.

54:04.842 --> 54:05.774
That's when my shift starts.

54:05.776 --> 54:08.210
Okay. We know where
to find you.

54:08.212 --> 54:11.380
Cool. Enjoy the pizza.

54:11.382 --> 54:13.182
Thank you, baby!

54:13.184 --> 54:14.650
Gentlemen?

54:16.920 --> 54:18.988
You want a piece?

54:18.990 --> 54:20.190
You gotta be kiddin'.

54:20.191 --> 54:22.992
I don't eat delivered pizza.

54:22.994 --> 54:24.493
Of course, you don't,

54:24.495 --> 54:25.628
big spender.

54:25.630 --> 54:30.132
You knew what was goo
d for your health,

54:30.134 --> 54:31.300
you'd surrender that cash

54:31.302 --> 54:33.502
and get your ass out of town
as fast as you can.

54:33.504 --> 54:37.740
That sounds like you're a
scrawny, little schoolboy

54:37.742 --> 54:41.210
runnin' from the class bully.

54:41.212 --> 54:41.844
Trust me.

54:41.846 --> 54:46.248
You do not want to lock horns w
with Jimmy Diamonds.

54:46.250 --> 54:47.283
And why is that?

54:47.285 --> 54:48.384
All I'm sayin'

54:48.386 --> 54:53.422
is Jimmy Diamonds just as
soon kill you as lose.

54:56.793 --> 54:58.060
Uh!

55:07.871 --> 55:10.572
Hey! You lookin' at me?

55:19.249 --> 55:20.582
Ahh!

55:22.252 --> 55:25.287
The Indonesian Infiniblade.

55:25.289 --> 55:27.122
What can't it cut through?

55:31.262 --> 55:32.428
Ooh!

55:34.097 --> 55:35.964
Did you order a large?

55:35.966 --> 55:39.301
I hope there's
sausage on that.

55:41.539 --> 55:43.272
Today at the
Merion Cricket Club

55:43.274 --> 55:44.340
outside Philadelphia,

55:44.342 --> 55:45.874
the young phenom, Aaron Bolt,

55:45.876 --> 55:49.011
captured his second consecutive
American Amateur Championship,

55:49.013 --> 55:52.014
leaving no question about his e
merging dominance.

55:52.016 --> 55:53.982
Many experts are
beginning to predict

55:53.984 --> 55:57.186
he will be the next great
American golfer.

55:58.522 --> 56:03.225
¶ Everything is tellin'
m e ¶

56:04.395 --> 56:07.463
¶ To finally give up ¶

56:07.465 --> 56:09.365

56:33.557 --> 56:34.790
What'll it be?

56:34.792 --> 56:39.528
Hey, buddy, there's a two-drink
minimum for the show.

56:39.530 --> 56:40.295
Excuse me?

56:40.297 --> 56:41.363
If you're gonna stay,

56:41.365 --> 56:42.798
you're gonna have to
order a drink.

56:42.800 --> 56:44.433
Oh, uh, right. Um, yeah, sorry.

56:44.435 --> 56:46.168
What do you like?

56:46.170 --> 56:47.669
What do you got?

56:47.671 --> 56:49.037
What?

56:49.039 --> 56:50.205
What do you recommend?

56:50.207 --> 56:51.707
Me, I like, uh, vodka,

56:51.709 --> 56:53.142
splash of cranberry
with a twist.

56:53.144 --> 56:56.445
Perfect. Sounds healthy.
Count me in.

56:58.314 --> 57:01.617
¶ But I love you ¶

57:01.619 --> 57:04.219
¶ I love you ¶

¶ My love ¶

57:52.869 --> 57:55.471
Hey, Lana!

57:56.840 --> 57:57.973
I have had it with
you coming o n

57:57.975 --> 58:00.242
to every swingin' dick that
walks through that door!

58:00.244 --> 58:02.377
I'm a performer. It's a show.

58:02.379 --> 58:03.745
Grow up, asshole!

58:05.215 --> 58:06.615
Hey!

58:06.617 --> 58:08.484
Get your hands off her!

58:08.486 --> 58:09.585
Get lost, jerk!

58:09.587 --> 58:11.753
That's funny. I could tell the
same thing to you.

58:11.755 --> 58:13.322
What the hell do you think you'
re doin'?

58:13.324 --> 58:14.623
I'm was gonna take a leak.

58:14.625 --> 58:17.993
But now I'm gonna kick your ass
if you touch her again.

58:17.995 --> 58:19.161
Do you know this asshole?

58:19.163 --> 58:22.998
Yeah. He's a black
belt in karate.

58:26.302 --> 58:28.437
I'm tempted to find out.

58:28.439 --> 58:29.938
Suit yourself.

58:38.581 --> 58:40.115
Thanks.

58:42.352 --> 58:45.220
You, uh...

58:45.222 --> 58:46.955
You sing really good.

58:49.325 --> 58:51.026
I have my moments.

58:54.130 --> 58:58.500
The bathroom is down the
hall on the right.

58:58.502 --> 59:01.837
Make sure to wash your hands.

59:02.906 --> 59:06.074
I'll wash my hands
before and after.

59:08.545 --> 59:11.179
It sounds interesting.

59:12.248 --> 59:13.382
What's the catch?

59:13.384 --> 59:15.717
There's no catch. There's
no downside.

59:15.719 --> 59:19.021
And you get to keep 10%
out of the take.

59:19.023 --> 59:23.158
So all I gotta do is beat one g
guy I've never heard of?

59:23.160 --> 59:24.493
One guy.

59:24.495 --> 59:28.530
That sounds simple enough.

59:28.532 --> 59:29.331
Yeah?

59:29.333 --> 59:31.253
Riverboat's here.

59:35.438 --> 59:36.538
Bring him in.

59:45.281 --> 59:46.181
You ever wondered

59:46.183 --> 59:48.717
what the devil himself
looks like?

59:50.520 --> 59:51.653
Behold.

59:52.488 --> 59:54.189
Aaron, say hi to Riverboat.

59:54.191 --> 59:55.991
Riverboat, Aaron Bolt,

59:55.993 --> 01:00:00.495
the number-one-ranked
amateur in the world.

01:00:00.497 --> 01:00:01.763
Ah-ah, don't shake his hand.

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:05.233
He's probably got a tack
taped to his palm.

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:09.371
You really as good as
everybody says?

01:00:09.373 --> 01:00:10.439
You don't have to answer that.

01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:11.873
He's just messin'
with your head.

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:14.910
No, I'm better.

01:00:14.912 --> 01:00:16.745
Wow.

01:00:16.747 --> 01:00:18.313
On that promisin' note,

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:20.582
maybe we should talk
about the match.

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:23.085
Okay, talk.

01:00:23.087 --> 01:00:24.553
Have you given any thoughts

01:00:24.555 --> 01:00:25.988
about what the bet should be?

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:28.323
Have I given any thought to what
t the bet should be?

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:30.792
Yes, I have, as a
matter of fact.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:32.227
One game, 18 holes,

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:35.731
$500,000 cash money, as
you like to say.

01:00:35.733 --> 01:00:38.634
No side bets, and none of
the other bullshit

01:00:38.636 --> 01:00:40.736
that you like to conjure up.

01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:45.073
$500,000, and my boy's gotta
play Aaron Bolt,

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:48.644
the hottest young player in
the game today.

01:00:48.646 --> 01:00:52.414
You bring your gunslinger,

01:00:52.416 --> 01:00:53.415
I bring mine.

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:56.351
Aw, no.

01:00:57.053 --> 01:01:00.722
Rocky Balboa versus
Apollo Creed.

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.663
Well...

01:01:11.734 --> 01:01:13.669
Mmm, damn it.

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:15.904
Ooh, okay.

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:16.938
Okay.

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.676
Except I think we should stop p
pussy-footin' around

01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:23.245
and play for an even million.

01:01:32.322 --> 01:01:34.556
You want to... You want to
bet a million,

01:01:34.558 --> 01:01:37.826
and you haven't seen
my man play?

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:40.996
Ubatz.

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:42.998
Probably a little
ill-advised o f me,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.101
but there it is.

01:01:46.103 --> 01:01:47.669
Where?

01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:48.904
Wynn, Las Vegas.

01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:52.074
Ha. Wynn, Las Vegas.

01:01:52.076 --> 01:01:53.875
Now, they don't allow
two-bit hoodlums

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:55.744
like you on that course.

01:01:55.746 --> 01:01:59.414
If that isn't the pot callin'
the kettle black.

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:03.719
But they do allow current U.S.
American champions,

01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:05.687
thus, the tee time.

01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:08.323
Verification of cash
at a location

01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:11.093
to be determined in
the morning.

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:17.032
Two players at Wynn, Las Vegas.

01:02:17.034 --> 01:02:21.870
18 holes, million dollars
to the winner.

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:23.572
Life-changing.

01:02:23.574 --> 01:02:24.740
What's your player's name?

01:02:24.742 --> 01:02:26.374
No, he doesn't have a name.

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:29.678
Well, has he played in any
national tournaments?

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:33.014
No. No, he doesn't.

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:37.285
Game on?

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:40.021
Yeah, game on. Now
get outta here.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.566
Fuckin' clown.

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:03.678
Hey, God bless you, man.
Anything?

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.781
It's tough.

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:07.849
Yeah.

01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:09.417
Thanks, man.

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:13.922
Hey! Hey!

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:16.625
Hey! Oh!

01:03:16.627 --> 01:03:19.761
Really?! Watch where
you're goin'!

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.796
¶ And I don't want to hurt
the one I love ¶

01:04:27.798 --> 01:04:32.767
¶ It's all around me ¶

01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:35.604
¶ Trouble ¶

01:04:35.606 --> 01:04:39.174
¶ I know you never hurt the
one you love ¶

01:04:39.176 --> 01:04:43.211
¶ And I don't want to hurt
the one I love ¶

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:47.916
¶ Please don't make me hurt
the one I love ¶

01:04:47.918 --> 01:04:49.351
¶ Yeah ¶

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.926
Thank you.

01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:09.471
Man, drinking alone in Vegas,

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:12.607
the weight of the world
on his shoulders.

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:22.751
Baby, I can make all your
troubles go away.

01:05:22.753 --> 01:05:26.221
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

01:05:26.223 --> 01:05:30.926
Doctor, one more of
whatever he 's having

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:33.728
and a Scotch neat for the lady.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.575
¶ Sea lion woman, sea lion ¶

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:49.945
¶ She drank coffee, sea lion ¶

01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:52.414
¶ She drank tea, sea lion ¶

01:05:52.416 --> 01:05:54.849
¶ And he gamble lie, sea lion ¶

01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:57.319
¶ Way down yonder, sea lion ¶

01:05:57.321 --> 01:05:59.454
¶ I'm gonna maul, sea lion ¶

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:01.957
¶ And a rooster crow,
sea lion ¶

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:04.626
¶ And he got no lie, sea lion ¶

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:06.795
¶ Sea lion woman, sea lion ¶

01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:09.564
¶ She drank coffee, sea lion ¶

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:12.000
¶ She drank tea, sea lion ¶

01:06:12.002 --> 01:06:14.402
¶ And he gamble lie, sea lion ¶

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:16.638
¶ And he gamble lie, sea lion ¶

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:20.508
¶ And he gamble lie, sea lion ¶

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:33.421
Let me take care of this, baby.

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:36.424
¶ Sea lion woman, sea lion ¶

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:38.760
¶ She drank coffee, sea lion ¶

01:06:38.762 --> 01:06:40.929
¶ She drank tea, sea lion ¶

01:06:40.931 --> 01:06:43.531
¶ And he gamble lie, sea lion ¶

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:45.900
¶ Way down yonder, sea lion ¶

01:06:45.902 --> 01:06:47.869
¶ I'm gonna maul, sea lion ¶

01:06:47.871 --> 01:06:50.572
¶ And the rooster crow,
sea lion ¶

01:06:50.574 --> 01:06:52.874
¶ And the rooster crow,
sea lion ¶

01:06:52.876 --> 01:06:55.643
¶ And the rooster crow,
sea lion ¶

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:58.780
¶ And he got no lie, sea lion ¶

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:04.886
Well, well.

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:07.689
Caught with your pants down.

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:10.992
Not so much fun, is it?

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.489
Your man and I have
arranged for a game.

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:42.991
You're gonna play
this young kid,

01:07:42.993 --> 01:07:44.993
who I believe is destined to be

01:07:44.995 --> 01:07:47.062
one of the all-time greats.

01:07:47.064 --> 01:07:49.531
Frankly, I think that he
can be at you,

01:07:49.533 --> 01:07:53.334
but I need for you to be
sure t hat he does.

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:56.171
You understand?

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:01.843
I asked you a question.

01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:03.711
Do you understand?

01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:08.049
He's deaf.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:13.655
Now, here is a promise.

01:08:13.657 --> 01:08:15.657
If you do not lose the match,

01:08:15.659 --> 01:08:16.758
you're gonna be found
at the bottom

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.594
of the nearest swimming pool we
wearing lead boots.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:24.032
Is there any part of that you
don't understand?

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:26.568
And one more thing.

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:29.837
Not a word of this to anybody,

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.372
because I will know.

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:33.774
I will know.

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:35.970
Goin' somewhere?

01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:36.770
Apparently not!

01:09:36.773 --> 01:09:39.506
You're obviously not payin'
attention, boy.

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:40.675
Get in.

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:08.870
I didn't bargain for any of
this, Riverboat.

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:10.738
Oh, yes, you did.

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:14.209
Are you stupid?

01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:16.344
You blind, or both?

01:10:16.346 --> 01:10:21.616
You realize if you vanish
what happens to me?

01:10:21.618 --> 01:10:22.717
No.

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:25.253
Why, in this town once
a bet's made,

01:10:25.255 --> 01:10:28.189
if the player doesn't show up,

01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:30.225
the bet is forfeited.

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:31.526
Gone.

01:10:31.528 --> 01:10:33.428
Las Vegas rules.

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:39.033
So this great escape of
yours would cost me

01:10:39.035 --> 01:10:40.468
million dollars cash money.

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:46.641
Riverboat, Jimmy Diamonds came
to my hotel room last night.

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:51.045
He told me if I didn't
lose this match,

01:10:51.047 --> 01:10:53.014
he's gonna kill me.

01:10:55.485 --> 01:10:57.252
Now...

01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:59.220
Now you know what your
life's worth

01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:00.622
on the open market.

01:11:00.624 --> 01:11:04.225
So Jimmy Diamonds
threatened to kill you

01:11:04.227 --> 01:11:05.526
if you don't lose.

01:11:05.528 --> 01:11:07.528
Let me give you one more
piece of information.

01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:11.566
If you don't win, I'm
gonna kill you.

01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:15.403
You win, you're dead.

01:11:15.405 --> 01:11:18.506
You lose, you're dead.

01:11:22.144 --> 01:11:25.713
How's it feel to be
caught in a squeeze?

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:34.289
Here's a reminder.

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:48.736
Now, Aaron Bolt's
gonna show up.

01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:50.905
He's gonna play 18
holes of golf.

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:54.342
If you don't show up and win...

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:58.680
your whole world come tumblin'
down.

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:29.143
Hey.

01:12:29.145 --> 01:12:30.144
What the hell is going on?

01:12:30.146 --> 01:12:31.846
I've been calling and calling
and texting you!

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:34.749
Baby, I need for you to
listen to me, okay?

01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:35.983
I gotta tell you something
really quick.

01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:39.020
I need for you to listen to
me carefully, okay?

01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:40.054
No, no, no! It's not okay!

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:43.825
Why haven't you called me
or your mother?

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:47.695
Natalie, please just
listen to me.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:52.900
I gotta tell you

01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:54.969
you're probably the most perfect
person that I ever met.

01:12:54.971 --> 01:12:58.272
I'm sorry that I didn't make you
u feel like it sometimes.

01:12:58.274 --> 01:13:02.210
Augie, no one is perfect.

01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:02.810
You just...

01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:05.346
I mean, you sound like a
different person.

01:13:05.348 --> 01:13:08.116
Here's the second thing.

01:13:08.118 --> 01:13:12.320
And this is hard. No, kiddin',
okay?

01:13:12.322 --> 01:13:13.654
So no flinchin'.

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:19.260
I need you take care of my
mama and Rosie.

01:13:19.262 --> 01:13:20.695
If somethin' happens to me,

01:13:20.697 --> 01:13:24.665
promise me that you will take c
are of them no matter what.

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:28.503
Augie? What the hell
is going o n?

01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:31.572
Okay, you're gonna tell me what
's going on right now,

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:33.474
or I'm gonna hang up.

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:19.420
We good.

01:14:19.422 --> 01:14:21.422
We good.

01:14:21.424 --> 01:14:22.190
We're good.

01:14:22.192 --> 01:14:24.058
Jessie holds the money
in my limo,

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:27.795
and Lorenzo and O.D.
handle security.

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:31.966
How about Lorenzo and O.D. hold
the money in my car

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:34.535
and Jessie can kiss my ass?

01:14:34.537 --> 01:14:37.171
Ass-kissing comin' right up.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:11.339
Good luck.

01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:12.440
You, too.

01:15:12.442 --> 01:15:14.308
What's your name?

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:15.476
I'm Augie.

01:15:15.478 --> 01:15:16.477
Aaron.

01:15:16.479 --> 01:15:19.580
I know. Aaron Bolt.

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:22.183
Good day, gentlemen.

01:15:22.185 --> 01:15:23.518
I see you've already met.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.819
Yeah, we met.

01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:27.121
And we're clear what
the stakes are.

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:29.824
Yeah.

01:15:29.826 --> 01:15:31.192
Okay, then.

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:32.927
Since we're the visiting team,

01:15:32.929 --> 01:15:35.396
I think we should have
the honors.

01:15:35.398 --> 01:15:37.765
Augie? Play away, please.

01:15:57.586 --> 01:15:59.220
Shot.

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.006
Get up!

01:16:52.908 --> 01:16:54.075
Get up!

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.807
Get up, get up.

01:17:45.894 --> 01:17:47.728
Numero uno.

01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:48.996
Cha cha cha.

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:55.603
Too bad.

01:17:55.605 --> 01:17:56.704
Damn it!

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:00.374
Two down.

01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:10.751
Got any 4s?

01:18:10.753 --> 01:18:11.886
Go fish.

01:18:11.888 --> 01:18:14.722
You got any jacks?

01:18:14.724 --> 01:18:15.723
Man.

01:18:15.725 --> 01:18:16.657
Ha ha!

01:18:16.659 --> 01:18:18.325
Hand 'em over, sucker.

01:18:18.327 --> 01:18:19.660
Four jacks for me.

01:18:19.662 --> 01:18:21.462
Do I get to ax again?

01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:22.396
Keep goin'.

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:32.506
Hey! Hold
off a minute!

01:18:32.508 --> 01:18:34.942
Excuse me.

01:18:35.912 --> 01:18:37.645
One minute!

01:18:37.647 --> 01:18:40.648
Whoo!

01:18:40.650 --> 01:18:41.782
Sorry.

01:18:47.289 --> 01:18:48.222
Who's the broad?

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:49.657
Never seen
her before.

01:18:49.659 --> 01:18:52.193
Why do I think
you're lyin'?

01:18:52.195 --> 01:18:55.830
Maybe 'cause you always
think I 'm lyin'.

01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:58.766
Hey, handsome.

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:02.937
Who are you?

01:19:02.939 --> 01:19:04.805
The enemy.

01:19:04.807 --> 01:19:06.173
That's too bad.

01:19:06.175 --> 01:19:08.676
Oh, wow, what a beautiful hole.

01:19:08.678 --> 01:19:11.812
And the water, it's just...

01:19:11.814 --> 01:19:13.080
Yeah.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:14.381
Okay.

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:16.784
Good luck.

01:19:45.914 --> 01:19:47.948
Shit.

01:19:57.592 --> 01:19:59.827
Sit, ball!

01:19:59.829 --> 01:20:00.928
Sit!

01:20:02.397 --> 01:20:04.932
Let's go, Augie.

01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:20.681
Get in!

01:20:20.683 --> 01:20:21.982
Get in there! Yes!

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:23.484
Oh, yeah.

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:26.353
Do you remember our
conversation?

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:29.723
Yeah. How could I forget?

01:20:29.725 --> 01:20:31.592
Make sure you don't.

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:36.831
You got this.

01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:15.836
It's good.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.981
That's good.

01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:04.952
Augie.

01:22:06.288 --> 01:22:08.956
Nice putt.

01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:09.790
Yeah. Yeah.

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:11.625
Match even goin' in

01:22:11.627 --> 01:22:15.930
Your appointment with
destiny h as arrived.

01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:18.565
What about Jimmy Diamonds?

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:21.869
Why don't you win this one?

01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:26.140
Win this for your family.

01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:43.991
Final hole,

01:22:43.993 --> 01:22:46.060
last out in baseball,

01:22:46.062 --> 01:22:48.729
final play in football,

01:22:48.731 --> 01:22:51.865
last minute in a
basketball game.

01:22:51.867 --> 01:22:53.701
Moment of truth.

01:22:53.703 --> 01:22:54.969
This is what we play for

01:22:54.971 --> 01:22:56.136
Mm-hmm.

01:23:21.696 --> 01:23:22.830
Where the hell is he?

01:23:22.832 --> 01:23:25.766
Preparing to put the
final dagger

01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:27.968
into your wicked heart.

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:38.579
I don't know what you're up to,

01:23:38.581 --> 01:23:39.513
but a million dollars says

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:41.782
you're not gonna get
away with it.

01:23:43.085 --> 01:23:45.686
What the hell is this?

01:23:45.688 --> 01:23:48.088
Gentlemen, sorry to
interrupt y our game,

01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:51.859
but I'm with the Internal
Revenue Service, the IRS.

01:23:51.861 --> 01:23:53.427
I trust you've heard of it.

01:23:53.429 --> 01:23:56.163
What is the problem, officer?

01:23:57.399 --> 01:24:01.969
You Reese Baudry, aka
Riverboat?

01:24:01.971 --> 01:24:04.972
That must make you
James Diamondes,

01:24:04.974 --> 01:24:06.373
also known as Jimmy Diamonds.

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:11.645
This is a private game being
played on private property.

01:24:11.647 --> 01:24:12.847
But becomes a federal offense

01:24:12.848 --> 01:24:15.149
when people are
gambling illegally.

01:24:15.151 --> 01:24:17.151
See, the IRS and the FBI

01:24:17.153 --> 01:24:20.120
have been monitoring your
gambling activities in

01:24:20.122 --> 01:24:20.621
various state s.

01:24:20.623 --> 01:24:23.157
Seems the two of you live pretty
y high off the hog

01:24:23.159 --> 01:24:25.159
with no apparent income.

01:24:25.161 --> 01:24:28.028
But you get a chance to explain
that to a federal judge.

01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:29.430
We're placing you under arrest

01:24:29.432 --> 01:24:31.498
for suspicion of income
tax evasion.

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.700
You have the right to
remain silent...

01:24:33.702 --> 01:24:34.701
No, no, no. Save it!

01:24:34.703 --> 01:24:36.703
This isn't gonna hold
up in court!

01:24:36.705 --> 01:24:37.971
Check your history.

01:24:37.973 --> 01:24:40.607
This is exactly how we
busted Al Capone.

01:24:40.609 --> 01:24:42.176
You're gonna pay for this.

01:24:42.178 --> 01:24:44.211
We'll see who pays.

01:24:44.213 --> 01:24:46.146
Take 'em away, boys.

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:52.853
The rest of you are free to go.

01:24:52.855 --> 01:24:53.487
But in future,

01:24:53.489 --> 01:24:56.256
I'd pay more attention to the
company you keep.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.668
Hey, haven't I seen you before?

01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:11.105
Only in your dreams. Have a
nice life, lady.

01:25:11.107 --> 01:25:11.905
Don't get jinky with me!

01:25:11.907 --> 01:25:13.807
Your dreams will turn
into nightmares

01:25:13.809 --> 01:25:15.576
when we sort this all out!

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:19.847
What is this?

01:25:19.849 --> 01:25:21.648
Oh, come on. FBI,
my ass.

01:25:21.650 --> 01:25:24.384
We're being kidnapped by
the Taliban.

01:26:38.593 --> 01:26:40.194
Ahh.

01:26:40.196 --> 01:26:41.795
Oh, really? Really?

01:26:41.797 --> 01:26:45.132
You two really think you're
gonna get away with this, huh?

01:26:45.134 --> 01:26:48.168
On your knees now.

01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:50.270
No.

01:26:51.407 --> 01:26:53.207
Ho! Ho! Whoa!

01:26:53.908 --> 01:26:56.243
Who taught you
how to shoot?

01:26:56.245 --> 01:26:59.246
My daddy since I was 11.

01:26:59.248 --> 01:27:01.014
You in on this?

01:27:01.016 --> 01:27:03.217
Yeah, I was gonna ask
you the same.

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:07.187
So, Riverboat, you
remember that deal

01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:09.556
we made before we came
to Las Vegas?

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:13.827
You said I could win
$100,000 guaranteed.

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:21.368
Now, you boys put up $1
million each.

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:28.041
So now I am taking $100,000 of
it exactly as you said.

01:27:28.043 --> 01:27:30.811
Not a penny more and not
a penny less,

01:27:30.813 --> 01:27:33.413
because I believe I earned it.

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:34.481
You really think

01:27:34.483 --> 01:27:36.450
you're gonna get to keep
all of that money?

01:27:36.452 --> 01:27:39.953
You're gonna have to kill us,
both of us!

01:27:39.955 --> 01:27:42.389
Now, in this suitcase
to my left,

01:27:42.391 --> 01:27:45.726
we got $1.9 million,

01:27:45.728 --> 01:27:48.161
and in this suitcase
to my right,

01:27:48.163 --> 01:27:49.529
we got a loaded gun.

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:54.001
Here's the deal, gentlemen.

01:27:54.003 --> 01:27:55.669
One of you guys are gonna get

01:27:55.671 --> 01:27:57.170
your initial million dollars,

01:27:57.172 --> 01:28:00.407
plus 900,000 for your troubles.

01:28:00.409 --> 01:28:02.309
And the other one?

01:28:02.311 --> 01:28:04.177
Well, not gonna make it home

01:28:04.179 --> 01:28:06.280
for supper tonight
unfortunately.

01:28:06.282 --> 01:28:08.248
Come on now, boy.

01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:09.583
You're in way over your head.

01:28:09.585 --> 01:28:13.053
Now, one of us is gonna
survive this charade,

01:28:13.055 --> 01:28:13.854
and guess what?

01:28:13.856 --> 01:28:15.889
You'll be the first point
of business.

01:28:15.891 --> 01:28:16.857
That's right.

01:28:16.859 --> 01:28:17.958
Really? Well, we've already

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.559
figured that one, didn't we,
baby?

01:28:19.561 --> 01:28:20.527
Mm-hmm.

01:28:20.529 --> 01:28:24.064
You see, that IRS agent that
arrested you boys,

01:28:24.066 --> 01:28:27.200
he's actually the chief of
police in my hometown,

01:28:27.202 --> 01:28:29.169
and he's a family friend.

01:28:29.171 --> 01:28:31.305
So if anything happens to me,

01:28:31.307 --> 01:28:32.906
he's gonna know who did it.

01:28:32.908 --> 01:28:35.976
He's gonna track you down to the
e ends of the earth

01:28:35.978 --> 01:28:39.146
and make sure that
justice is served.

01:28:39.948 --> 01:28:41.782
Got it? Yeah.

01:28:44.352 --> 01:28:46.420
You got 'em, baby?

01:28:46.422 --> 01:28:47.321
Yep.

01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:51.692
Ow. All right.

01:28:55.396 --> 01:28:56.530
Shit.

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:07.240
Hey, you little...

01:29:07.242 --> 01:29:08.442
Hey!

01:29:16.484 --> 01:29:18.552
Gentlemen.

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:21.955
Nice doin' business with you.

01:29:21.957 --> 01:29:23.690
May the
worst man lose!

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:33.667
¶ When I wake up, well, I

¶ And I would walk 500 more ¶

01:34:07.109 --> 01:34:10.377
¶ Nothin' more she can say ¶

01:34:10.379 --> 01:34:14.114
¶ Money has affected my heart ¶

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:20.320
¶ It's taken its toll on me ¶

01:34:20.322 --> 01:34:23.556
¶ And all the family ¶

01:34:23.558 --> 01:34:30.063
¶ Watch me let it ride ¶

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:37.971
¶ And all of our lives ¶

01:34:37.973 --> 01:34:44.511
¶ Are lived inside once
it arrives ¶

01:34:44.513 --> 01:34:51.151
¶ And all of our dreams ¶

01:34:51.153 --> 01:34:56.923
¶ They fall apart
at the seams ¶

01:34:57.305 --> 01:35:03.851
