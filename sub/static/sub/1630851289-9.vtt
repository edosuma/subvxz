<i> (Linda grunting)</i>

00:21.580 --> 00:23.522
-Ugh, so filthy.
-Us or the house?

00:23.749 --> 00:26.674
-Both, kind of. No offense.
-None taken. Oops.

00:26.769 --> 00:29.528
Listen, don't forget, we got
to keep the apartment clean

00:29.755 --> 00:31.012
for when Violet comes.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.180
Who's Violet, again?

00:32.199 --> 00:33.348
The woman who wrote us
that letter,

00:33.442 --> 00:34.700
who grew up in the apartment.

00:34.851 --> 00:36.684
She's coming over this afternoon
to see the old place.

00:36.779 --> 00:39.930
She's gonna be disappointed
when she remembers it's this.

00:39.948 --> 00:42.599
Dad, can you take another bite,
but this time, look more alive?

00:42.601 --> 00:44.543
-Huh?
-It's for my photography class
assignment.

00:44.694 --> 00:47.529
-The theme is life.
-Why is me eating eggs life?

00:47.548 --> 00:50.624
Um, because it's due today
and I kind of waited

00:50.776 --> 00:52.609
till the last minute, so smile?

00:52.611 --> 00:54.219
-Hmm.
-Thattagirl.

00:54.371 --> 00:55.445
I mean, I'm not
totally confident

00:55.464 --> 00:56.722
with the school camera.

00:56.873 --> 00:59.725
A lot of the pictures
I take are kind of blurry--

00:59.876 --> 01:02.286
sometimes a lot blurry--
but at least I don't skip class

01:02.379 --> 01:03.804
-like everyone else.
-Oh.

01:03.956 --> 01:06.881
And by "everyone," I mean Tammy,
Jimmy Jr., Jocelyn and Zeke.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.642
Ah, the teenage pubin'
ninja turtles.

01:08.794 --> 01:11.386
Yeah, they sneak off
during class and get slushies

01:11.405 --> 01:12.963
at the convenience store
down the street.

01:12.981 --> 01:14.907
And then they hang out
at an abandoned house

01:15.134 --> 01:16.909
that's partly demolished.

01:17.136 --> 01:18.560
They call it Half House.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.137
I've never gone with them,
but it sounds great.

01:20.306 --> 01:22.989
Counterpoint: sounds terrible.
Except for the slushies part.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.342
We used to skip school and go
to the dried-up sewer tunnel.

01:25.344 --> 01:27.144
It smelled a little,
but it was fun.

01:27.162 --> 01:28.312
But you shouldn't skip.

01:28.330 --> 01:29.646
No, I know. I don't skip class.

01:29.665 --> 01:31.498
But I feel like I miss out
on all the fun.

01:31.650 --> 01:33.817
Well, you probably miss out
on a lot of tetanus.

01:33.836 --> 01:35.577
Hey, T, take a picture of this.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.487
I'm Glenn Toast. (babbles)

01:37.506 --> 01:39.581
Gene! You're getting crumbs
all over the floor.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.249
Sorry. It's for art.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.251
<i> TAMMY:</i>
<i> Oh, my God.</i>

01:43.329 --> 01:44.419
Half House was so fun yesterday.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.012
Remember when some
of the ceiling fell down

01:46.165 --> 01:47.831
and we pretended we were
putting in a skylight?

01:47.924 --> 01:50.258
Yeah.
So much natural light.

01:50.352 --> 01:52.836
(sighs) I wouldn't mind
seeing natural light.

01:52.929 --> 01:54.929
Hey, have you guys noticed
Mr. Branca's been mopping

01:55.007 --> 01:56.782
that same spot
for a really long time?

01:56.933 --> 01:58.450
GENE:
Maybe he's lost in thought,

01:58.602 --> 02:00.435
remembering all the tricky
spills he's cleaned up.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.028
-And all the spills
that got away.
-Oh...

02:02.181 --> 02:05.273
Oops, it rolled over there.
You better go get it.

02:05.367 --> 02:07.701
-Odd.
-Yeah. Why does he hate
pencils so much?

02:07.853 --> 02:10.111
Because they taunt you with
their delicious-looking erasers

02:10.131 --> 02:12.447
that actually
don't taste that good?

02:12.541 --> 02:15.359
And here's the living room
that always looks this clean.

02:15.361 --> 02:18.879
Oh, my goodness.
It's just like I remembered.

02:18.973 --> 02:20.380
-The wall?
-The whole room.

02:20.532 --> 02:21.807
Except we had
the couch over there,

02:21.958 --> 02:23.200
'cause it just made
the most sense.

02:23.293 --> 02:24.626
But the couch over there

02:24.794 --> 02:26.219
-is what you did.
-Oh. Uh-huh.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.147
So in your letter,
you mentioned you're in town

02:28.298 --> 02:29.481
for your mom's 90th birthday?

02:29.708 --> 02:32.209
Yep. We've got
a big family party planned.

02:32.227 --> 02:33.485
All the cousins are coming.

02:33.637 --> 02:38.157
Ooh, fun. Kissing cousins,
maybe? Right?

02:38.325 --> 02:39.716
No.

02:39.735 --> 02:41.643
-Right, right. Yuck.
-Could I look at my old room?

02:41.662 --> 02:43.478
Of course.
Just don't look under the bed.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.146
Not because
anyone stuffed a bunch

02:45.240 --> 02:46.573
of dirty clothes under there.

02:46.725 --> 02:48.149
<i> DE SANTO:</i>
<i> So you got the close-up,</i>

02:48.169 --> 02:49.893
the medium shot
and my favorite,

02:49.912 --> 02:51.152
the long shot.

02:51.246 --> 02:53.063
This is the one
that came in very handy

02:53.081 --> 02:54.581
in my work
as a private investigator.

02:54.733 --> 02:57.401
Caught a lot of dirty dogs
with the long shot.

02:57.419 --> 02:59.827
-Did I mention
I used to be a P.I.?
-ALL: Yes.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.181
Okay, remember, the photography
show is this Friday,

03:02.332 --> 03:05.184
and the theme is
different perspectives.

03:05.335 --> 03:06.576
Can I use this picture
of Jocelyn

03:06.595 --> 03:08.245
I just took on my phone
for the show?

03:08.263 --> 03:09.688
No, no cell phone pictures.

03:09.915 --> 03:11.581
This is a<i> film</i> photography
class.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.359
Like it's been since I gave you
the film cameras to use.

03:14.511 --> 03:16.511
-And all that film?
-(groans)

03:16.530 --> 03:18.197
And no slacking off
for this show, people.

03:18.348 --> 03:19.847
Look, I know I'm a fun teacher.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.183
Everyone wants to take
De Santo's class.

03:22.277 --> 03:24.110
"He's an authority figure
but he's also cool."

03:24.263 --> 03:25.687
ZEKE:
Yeah, you are.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.206
(tongue clicks)
But you know what's not cool?

03:27.433 --> 03:29.449
Slacking off, like some of you
have been doing.

03:29.601 --> 03:31.117
Not you, Susmita.
You're nailing it.

03:31.270 --> 03:32.436
Yeah, I was gonna say.

03:32.529 --> 03:34.271
So step it up,
because right now,

03:34.364 --> 03:36.531
it looks like a lot of you
are riding the D train.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.383
Oh, no. Mr. De Santo,
how do we know

03:38.535 --> 03:40.444
if we're currently
on the D train?

03:40.462 --> 03:43.204
When I hand you back your work
and it usually has D's on it,

03:43.224 --> 03:44.389
that's a pretty good sign.

03:44.616 --> 03:46.466
Oh, yeah,
that's sounding familiar.

03:46.618 --> 03:49.286
Okay, go explore
and take some pictures.

03:49.304 --> 03:50.637
I'll see you here
before the bell rings.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.065
(groans) I don't want
to get stuck on the D train.

03:53.216 --> 03:54.566
Oh, no! It broke.

03:54.718 --> 03:56.142
You can just screw it back on.

03:56.295 --> 03:57.753
Oh, cool trick.
Thanks, Susmita.

03:57.813 --> 04:00.964
It's not really a trick.
It's just how cameras work.

04:00.983 --> 04:02.816
Right, right.
Wink.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.392
Thanks, Bob.
I mean, it's not

04:04.411 --> 04:07.228
how Linda pours coffee--
you know, with a little flair--

04:07.248 --> 04:08.580
-but it's fine.
-Sorry, Teddy.

04:08.732 --> 04:10.490
Geez, Linda's been upstairs
for a while.

04:10.567 --> 04:11.733
I mean, how long
does it take for someone

04:11.752 --> 04:13.810
to look at our apartment?
It's not that big.

04:13.829 --> 04:16.496
-Oh, there they are.
-Bob, come here and meet Violet.

04:16.648 --> 04:19.907
-She's leaving.
-Linda, Bob poured
the coffee weird.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.668
-What?
-I-I'll tell you
when you come in.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.746
Bob, Violet says this place
used to be a donut shop.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.081
-Did we know that?
-I don't think so.

04:27.175 --> 04:28.325
It always smelled
so good out here.

04:28.418 --> 04:30.769
And now it smells...
(inhales sharply)

04:30.920 --> 04:32.086
So, I should get going.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.088
-Oh.
-Thank you both
for letting me come.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.257
Of course.
You come back anytime, okay?

04:36.351 --> 04:39.093
-All right, bye.
-Bye.

04:39.187 --> 04:40.779
O-Our place smells okay, right?

04:40.930 --> 04:42.522
(sniffs)
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.449
TINA:
Wow, so that was
some heavy-duty stuff

04:44.601 --> 04:46.451
about us needing
to step it up in class.

04:46.603 --> 04:49.437
Maybe no one should ditch
and we should all just have fun

04:49.515 --> 04:50.864
doing our photography
schoolwork?

04:51.033 --> 04:52.182
Nah. We're still
getting slushies

04:52.275 --> 04:53.458
-and going to Half House.
-Yeah.

04:53.610 --> 04:55.109
I want to play Is That
Gonna Give Me a Splinter?

04:55.129 --> 04:56.369
I love that game.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.522
Except that time I got
a really bad splinter.

04:58.540 --> 05:00.448
But, guys, I mean,
I'm pretty sure none of us

05:00.467 --> 05:02.450
can afford to get a D
in this class, right?

05:02.469 --> 05:05.211
Eh, I'm getting A's and B's
in all my other classes.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.306
One D is not gonna pee
on my GPA.

05:07.457 --> 05:08.974
-Me, too.
-Same.
-Yeah.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.309
Wait, you guys are all
getting A's and B's?

05:10.494 --> 05:12.369
Even you, Jocelyn?
I mean, you, too, Jocelyn?

05:12.462 --> 05:15.147
-Yeah. I'm brainy.
-Come on, you guys.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.040
Let's get in touch
with some slush.

05:17.133 --> 05:18.391
Have fun.
(chuckles)

05:18.544 --> 05:20.210
<i> (sighs)</i>
<i> Look at them go.</i>

05:20.303 --> 05:21.545
<i> They're gonna have</i>
<i> the best time.</i>

05:21.638 --> 05:23.730
<i> How the hell is Jocelyn</i>
<i> getting A's and B's?</i>

05:23.824 --> 05:25.306
-Hey, Tina.
-Aah!

05:25.326 --> 05:27.308
Sorry to interrupt you doing
whatever it is you're doing.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.235
-Wait, why are you here?
-I was in study hall

05:29.330 --> 05:31.145
and I saw you out here
so I got a bathroom pass.

05:31.239 --> 05:33.223
Listen, I got a Branca update.

05:33.316 --> 05:34.649
Hey, I saw you guys talking,
so I told Coach Blevins

05:34.818 --> 05:37.485
that I lost a ball over here
'cause I kicked it so hard.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.896
-I'm a jock.
-So, guess who's still mopping

05:39.915 --> 05:41.064
the same spot.

05:41.157 --> 05:42.341
-Mr. Branca.
-Interesting.

05:42.568 --> 05:45.326
Maybe he's a robot
and got stuck in a mop loop?

05:45.346 --> 05:47.571
-(grunts)
-Oh, sorry,
I'm in the photo zone.

05:47.589 --> 05:49.514
-You know what I mean.
-Oh, yeah. Totally.

05:49.741 --> 05:51.741
Well, I guess I should
take some pictures, too.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.334
Of different perspectives.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.078
Is that why you're holding
your camera upside down?

05:55.097 --> 05:56.388
What? Dang it.

05:56.540 --> 05:58.264
Susmita, how are you so good
at this stuff?

05:58.359 --> 06:01.175
Tina, if you want, I can show
you some photography basics.

06:01.269 --> 06:02.936
-Really?
-Yeah, I mean,
turning the camera

06:03.088 --> 06:04.696
the right way
gets you halfway there.

06:04.848 --> 06:06.923
-Sort of.
-Right. Halfway.

06:07.016 --> 06:08.925
Half. Half House.

06:08.944 --> 06:10.869
-(laughter)
-This is the most fun

06:11.096 --> 06:12.353
I've had in my whole life!

06:12.373 --> 06:13.855
-SUSMITA: Tina?
-Huh? Yeah?

06:14.023 --> 06:15.115
You ready to take some pictures?

06:15.267 --> 06:17.767
Uh, yes, so slush.
I mean so much.

06:17.861 --> 06:19.294
I mean, yay.

06:23.366 --> 06:25.166
So, how was everyone's day
at school?

06:25.219 --> 06:26.885
Anyone pass any fun notes
during class?

06:27.036 --> 06:28.369
Give Mama the gossip.

06:28.463 --> 06:30.389
Well, let's see.
Mr. Branca's brain broke

06:30.616 --> 06:32.224
and he mopped
the same spot all day.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.467
Also, I kicked a ball
really hard in P.E.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.878
-No, I didn't.
-Tina, what about you?

06:36.955 --> 06:38.546
How did my egg picture work out?

06:38.640 --> 06:40.214
-Everybody see life in it?
-I don't know. You tell me.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.825
-BOB: It's good.
-It's blurry.

06:42.827 --> 06:44.477
They're all blurry.
And apparently you can get a D

06:44.554 --> 06:46.571
in photography class
when you take pictures

06:46.723 --> 06:47.906
that aren't "in focus."

06:48.057 --> 06:49.466
So now Susmita's helping me.

06:49.484 --> 06:52.244
Aw, that's the one you took
of everyone watching TV.

06:52.395 --> 06:53.787
You're not in it,
but you can't tell

06:53.897 --> 06:55.396
'cause everyone's
kind of blobby.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.082
-I'm putting this one
on the fridge.
-(phone chimes)

06:57.309 --> 06:58.825
Oh, I just got a text
from Violet.

06:58.977 --> 07:00.994
She wants to come tomorrow
and bring her brother.

07:01.146 --> 07:02.479
Huh, I'm surprised
she wants to come back.

07:02.497 --> 07:04.906
Well, y-you did say
"Come back any time."

07:04.925 --> 07:06.908
So maybe, not that surprising?

07:07.002 --> 07:08.318
Oh, boy.
I got to clean again.

07:08.411 --> 07:09.836
No one get anything
on the floor.

07:09.930 --> 07:10.929
In fact, let's eat
over the toilet

07:11.006 --> 07:12.155
so we can flush away the crumbs.

07:12.174 --> 07:13.414
-Yay!
-Wait, wait, never mind.

07:13.508 --> 07:15.917
-Bad idea, bad idea.
-Too late, I'm doing it.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.270
SUSMITA:
So that looks like
a leaf, right?

07:18.463 --> 07:20.163
Yeah. Wait is this
a trick question?

07:20.256 --> 07:23.591
But look what happens
when you go in really close.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.943
TINA:
Oh, cool. It's like
I'm on an airplane

07:25.094 --> 07:27.337
looking down
at a really neat ground.

07:27.355 --> 07:29.781
I'd call that perspective
a little different, right?

07:30.008 --> 07:32.175
Yeah, sure, sure.
Oh, hey, guys.

07:32.194 --> 07:34.177
Later, tater.
It's ditching hour.

07:34.196 --> 07:36.604
I'm gonna stay here.
You know, like I usually do.

07:36.698 --> 07:37.939
Oh, they're already gone.

07:38.033 --> 07:39.291
Um, do you want to take
some pictures?

07:39.442 --> 07:40.459
What? Uh, sure.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.069
Maybe I'll take some pictures
of this fence.

07:43.221 --> 07:45.112
-Lens cap.
-Huh? Who's Len Scap?

07:45.132 --> 07:47.114
No, your lens cap is on.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.468
Oh, whoops.
Good eye, Susmita, good eye.

07:49.619 --> 07:52.362
I can't stay long.
I got to get back to P.E.

07:52.380 --> 07:54.789
and hopefully not get hit
too hard in my pee place

07:54.883 --> 07:55.957
-with a dodgeball.
-Shh.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.884
Look, there's Branca,

07:58.036 --> 07:59.126
buffing the cleanest spot
in school.

07:59.295 --> 08:00.720
Come on. Let's go get
the download-ian

08:00.872 --> 08:01.871
from that custodian.

08:01.890 --> 08:03.815
Keep moving.
I'm buffing here.

08:04.042 --> 08:06.151
Speaking of, Mr. Branca,
seems like you've been cleaning

08:06.302 --> 08:08.545
this same spot
for the past two days.

08:08.638 --> 08:10.137
Hey, I don't come
to your classroom

08:10.232 --> 08:13.049
and tell you how to do
your algebras, do I?

08:13.142 --> 08:15.309
-I mean, I wish you would.
-Wait, did we get

08:15.329 --> 08:17.070
a new Wagstaff Whaler
model ship thingy?

08:17.222 --> 08:19.855
Ring, ring, ring.
That's the bell.

08:19.857 --> 08:21.816
You got to go.
Bye-bye.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.317
Aah! If you're hinting
for us to leave,

08:23.337 --> 08:26.079
you're not being
very subtle about it, FYI.

08:26.231 --> 08:29.323
-I'm back!
-Lin! Bob and I
missed you so much.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.918
Yeah.
You were gone a long time.

08:31.995 --> 08:34.237
I know, I know,
but Violet and her brother

08:34.256 --> 08:36.214
were telling me stories
about when they were little.

08:36.441 --> 08:38.591
We were laughing
and looking around the place.

08:38.668 --> 08:40.018
Oh, and they saw
your underwear drawer.

08:40.169 --> 08:42.020
-I'm sorry, it just happened.
-Uh, okay.

08:42.247 --> 08:45.006
Well, it's nice that Violet
got to see the apartment, again,

08:45.100 --> 08:46.416
but I'm glad you're back.

08:46.509 --> 08:49.343
I mean, I kind of miss
when both of us worked here.

08:49.437 --> 08:52.179
-Yeah, yeah, uh...
-Oh, no. What?

08:52.274 --> 08:53.923
They're coming back tomorrow
and bringing a lot of cousins.

08:53.942 --> 08:56.017
-They're coming again?
-Their whole family's in town

08:56.036 --> 08:57.536
for their mom's 90th,
and they want to see

08:57.763 --> 08:59.946
-the apartment, too.
-Hey, Lin, I have an idea.

09:00.098 --> 09:01.689
What if I go upstairs
with them tomorrow

09:01.783 --> 09:04.117
and you stay down here,
and it'll be a short visit

09:04.211 --> 09:06.044
'cause I'm not that good
at talking to people

09:06.271 --> 09:08.046
and they'll get uncomfortable
and leave?

09:08.197 --> 09:09.881
Aw, sweetie, people don't get

09:10.033 --> 09:11.608
<i> that</i> uncomfortable
talking to you.

09:11.626 --> 09:13.777
-Eh...
-I promise I'll keep it short.

09:13.795 --> 09:16.721
Oh, and don't use the bathroom
upstairs until then, okay?

09:16.873 --> 09:17.964
Oh, my God.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.282
<i> DE SANTO:</i>
<i> All right, people.</i>

09:19.301 --> 09:21.467
So, as a former P.I.,
I notice things.

09:21.620 --> 09:24.637
For instance, I just noticed
something in my garbage can.

09:24.790 --> 09:26.623
Four empty slushie cups.

09:26.641 --> 09:28.900
This makes me suspect
that some of you have been

09:29.127 --> 09:30.902
leaving school
during class time.

09:31.129 --> 09:32.812
What?
Nobody's leaving school.

09:32.964 --> 09:35.131
But if someone
was leaving school,

09:35.150 --> 09:36.390
would that even be a problem?

09:36.410 --> 09:38.225
I mean, 'cause this
is such an understanding,

09:38.245 --> 09:40.303
super cool, relaxed vibe
kind of class.

09:40.396 --> 09:42.581
Thank you, it is. But if you
were leaving school grounds

09:42.732 --> 09:44.082
during this cool class,

09:44.159 --> 09:46.067
I'd have to send you
to the principal's office,

09:46.086 --> 09:47.327
and you could be suspended.

09:47.479 --> 09:49.087
-Oh.
-Oh, my God.
-(bell rings)

09:49.314 --> 09:50.814
Looks like those little ditches
are gonna have

09:50.832 --> 09:51.981
-to ditch the ditching.
-Huh?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.240
Nothing.
Should we hit the darkroom?

09:53.260 --> 09:55.318
I brought a flashlight.
Just kidding.

09:55.337 --> 09:57.987
I know that ruins pictures.
I mean, I know that now.

TINA:
(groans) The photography show

10:18.026 --> 10:19.433
is tonight
and I'm still not sure

10:19.527 --> 10:21.268
which picture I should use.
I mean, this one's

10:21.363 --> 10:23.622
too blurry, that one's too dark,
that one is dark<i> and</i> blurry.

10:23.849 --> 10:25.957
-Tina, that one's pretty good.
-Really?

10:26.109 --> 10:28.201
TINA:
The picture I took of Tammy
and all those guys ditching?

10:28.353 --> 10:30.186
And not at all because I was
super jealous of them ditching?

10:30.279 --> 10:33.189
Yeah. The fence against
the blurry background, it's...

10:33.282 --> 10:36.376
-Did you mean to do that?
-Oh, uh, yeah?

10:36.528 --> 10:38.970
I think this one is gonna
get you off the D train.

10:39.163 --> 10:41.197
-(gasps) You think?
-D, for "definitely."

10:41.366 --> 10:43.958
I mean, you can't
really tell who they are.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.644
Yeah, they're all blurry blobs.

10:45.871 --> 10:47.036
So I can use this in the show.

10:47.130 --> 10:48.146
It really is my best picture.

10:48.297 --> 10:50.056
Yeah, it is.
Let that puppy dry out

10:50.208 --> 10:52.725
and get ready to get
an average grade in this class.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.394
Um, I don't think so.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.988
-(gasps) Tammy.
-You can go ahead
and drown that puppy,

10:57.215 --> 10:59.048
because you are not
using it in the show.

10:59.067 --> 11:00.733
I'm sorry I said that thing
about drowning puppies.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.494
Susmita's the one who brought
up puppies. It's her fault.

11:07.150 --> 11:08.391
No, Tina, you can't use
that photo in the show.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.484
I'm in it, and I don't
give you permission,

11:10.578 --> 11:12.912
I'm not signing a release
and I will sue your boobs off.

11:12.989 --> 11:14.414
It's not of you.
It's of a fence.

11:14.566 --> 11:16.007
A-And it's the only picture
I took

11:16.234 --> 11:17.233
that's good enough for the show.

11:17.402 --> 11:18.843
Well, then, crop me out of it.

11:18.995 --> 11:20.253
You can't really be cropped out.

11:20.405 --> 11:22.347
-You're in the middle.
-Sorry, can't use it.

11:22.574 --> 11:24.849
-But I really...
-Tina, I can't get
suspended for ditching.

11:25.001 --> 11:26.242
My parents are gonna
let me visit

11:26.335 --> 11:27.410
my cousin in Greece this summer.

11:27.429 --> 11:30.188
BFOG.
Boys From Other Greece, Tina.

11:30.415 --> 11:32.916
And if I get suspended, there's
no way they'll let me go.

11:32.934 --> 11:35.935
-Hey, girls.
-Oh, hey, Mr. De Santo.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.344
I got to step out
for a few minutes.

11:37.439 --> 11:39.255
The new blazers for
the debate team just arrived,

11:39.274 --> 11:42.258
and apparently the shoulder pads
are out of control.

11:42.277 --> 11:43.702
Leave any pictures
for the photography show

11:43.853 --> 11:45.019
on that shelf over there.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.429
I'm gonna put them up in a bit.

11:46.448 --> 11:48.114
-Okay.
-Got it.
-Mine's already there.

11:48.266 --> 11:51.192
Sorry, Tammy, but I really think
I got to use this picture.

11:51.286 --> 11:53.194
Hmm, you know what?
I'm looking at it again,

11:53.288 --> 11:54.879
and you're right,
you can hardly tell

11:55.031 --> 11:56.363
that beautiful person is me.

11:56.458 --> 11:58.775
Wait, so does that mean
you're okay if I use it?

11:58.793 --> 12:00.276
-Yeah. It's fine.
-Really?

12:00.295 --> 12:02.203
Yeah.
Hey, I just got an idea.

12:02.222 --> 12:05.206
Let's get after-school slushies
and go to Half House.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.875
After-school slushies
and after-school Half House?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.543
Okay, that's legal.
Susmita, you coming?

12:09.563 --> 12:12.213
Eh, I was gonna stay here
and do some more developing.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.140
Oh, Susmita, you have to come.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.291
Um, why?

12:15.310 --> 12:16.735
Uh, because
you're gonna love it.

12:16.886 --> 12:19.237
Put the school work down for
once and let loose, you goose.

12:19.314 --> 12:21.314
Yeah, come, Susmita.
It'll be fun, I assume.

12:21.466 --> 12:23.742
(chanting):
Come with us. We'll have fun.

12:23.969 --> 12:26.077
Come with us.
We'll have fun.

12:26.229 --> 12:27.971
At the house wh...
Oh.

12:28.064 --> 12:30.231
-Okay, I'll come.
-Mm-kay, great.

12:30.325 --> 12:32.066
So, you think there's gonna
be broken glass there?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.235
-If we're lucky.
-Oh, I just remembered

12:34.329 --> 12:36.070
I have to do this one thing
that I forgot I had to do

12:36.089 --> 12:37.647
and I really have to do it,

12:37.665 --> 12:40.817
but you guys go ahead and
I'll meet up with you in a bit.

12:40.910 --> 12:42.986
-Okay.
-Go, go, go.

12:43.079 --> 12:44.320
They sell out of
the red slushies sometimes,

12:44.339 --> 12:46.005
and the red slushies
are the best.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.690
Come on, Susmita.
We<i> half</i> to go.

12:47.692 --> 12:49.492
-Get it? Like Half House.
-Yeah, I get it.

12:49.511 --> 12:51.603
See?
We're already<i> halfing</i> fun.

12:51.754 --> 12:53.087
Okay, I'll stop.

12:53.181 --> 12:55.607
Oh, you're Violet's
cousin Lewis.

12:55.716 --> 12:57.091
I've heard so much about you.

12:57.185 --> 12:58.351
(low): Did you pass
the kidney stones yet?

12:58.503 --> 13:00.779
-Uh, working on it.
-Oh, good for you.

13:00.930 --> 13:02.113
Look at this picture.

13:02.265 --> 13:03.673
Doesn't this remind you
of the one we took

13:03.691 --> 13:05.266
when we were kids?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.026
You know, from Thanksgiving
when Victor was showing us

13:07.178 --> 13:08.953
his juggling and he hit
Mom's boob with an orange?

13:09.030 --> 13:10.530
-Aw.
-Oh, yeah.

13:10.682 --> 13:12.606
Except the couch was
on the other side of the room.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.517
And for the record, that was
my first time juggling oranges.

13:14.536 --> 13:17.203
-And Mom's boob was fine.
-Hey, you know what?

13:17.297 --> 13:19.464
Everybody from that picture
is here right now.

13:19.615 --> 13:22.783
-Except Mom.
-(gasps) You know
what you should do?

13:22.877 --> 13:24.302
Recreate your family photo.

13:24.412 --> 13:25.970
Like that guy
on the Internet did

13:26.197 --> 13:28.714
where he wore a onesie
and he sat on his dad's lap.

13:28.867 --> 13:29.882
Ooh, that's a great idea.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.035
We could get Mom
and bring her here.

13:32.128 --> 13:34.370
Linda, would it be okay
if we moved the couch?

13:34.463 --> 13:36.463
Just shift it a little bit
across the room.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.875
-Just for the picture.
-Oh, yeah, we got to move
the couch.

13:38.968 --> 13:40.376
You guys go ahead,
and I'm gonna text Bob

13:40.469 --> 13:41.986
and tell him I'll be up here
a little longer.

13:42.138 --> 13:44.638
"Coming back soon.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.157
Doing a quick thing first."

13:46.384 --> 13:47.826
VICTOR:
We'd have to move the TV, too.

13:47.977 --> 13:50.644
-And the coffee table.
-Yeah, yeah.

13:50.664 --> 13:51.888
"Lin. Please no."

13:51.981 --> 13:54.907
"It'll just take
a few minutes to an hour.

13:55.001 --> 13:59.170
Love, your great wife,
who you love, Linda."

13:59.397 --> 14:00.171
And send.

14:00.323 --> 14:01.673
<i> JIMMY JR.:</i>
<i> Look! Tina!</i>

14:01.900 --> 14:03.174
You can see the toilet
from the living room,

14:03.401 --> 14:05.343
and I can see you when
I'm sitting on the toilet.

14:05.494 --> 14:08.237
-Now, that's an open floor plan.
-That's, uh, great.

14:08.331 --> 14:11.516
-This is uh, all really great.
-Tammy's taking a long time,

14:11.667 --> 14:13.242
so I'm gonna take a sip
of her slushie.

14:13.261 --> 14:15.094
-Don't tell.
-Where is Tammy?

14:15.188 --> 14:17.188
She said she was gonna go
to the darkroom for some reason.

14:17.340 --> 14:19.023
And she said something
about a negative,

14:19.175 --> 14:21.860
and I was like,
"Just be positive, girl."

14:22.011 --> 14:23.920
(gasps) I knew
she was up to something.

14:23.938 --> 14:25.605
Tina, I bet she went back
to the darkroom

14:25.757 --> 14:28.091
-to mess up your picture.
-(gasps) Oh, my God.

14:28.184 --> 14:29.425
-I got to go.
-I'm coming with you.

14:29.518 --> 14:32.519
Uh, bye. Half House
is a whole lot of fun

14:32.688 --> 14:34.122
and not boring at all.

14:34.782 --> 14:35.765
(scraping, thudding)

14:35.858 --> 14:37.283
Ah. Whoa, what was that?

14:37.435 --> 14:39.193
You guys having a thunderstorm
in your apartment?

14:39.362 --> 14:42.288
It doesn't sound good,
whatever it is.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.031
(sighs) Okay, I'm gonna
find out what's happening,

14:44.200 --> 14:45.458
and if I can make it stop.

14:45.610 --> 14:47.218
Teddy, do you mind
if I lock you in?

14:47.370 --> 14:49.112
What? Now you're going
upstairs, too?

14:49.130 --> 14:50.947
No, no, no.
Just eat your burger

14:51.040 --> 14:51.964
and I'll be right back down.

14:52.058 --> 14:55.284
Uh, okay. I can do that.
Like this?

14:55.378 --> 14:57.637
Teddy, just eat the burger
the way you normally eat it

14:57.731 --> 14:58.804
and I'll be right back.

14:58.973 --> 15:01.140
Uh, Linda?
W-What's going on?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.959
We're recreating
the old living room

15:02.977 --> 15:05.795
so they can recreate a family
photo that was very funny.

15:05.813 --> 15:07.313
And Violet's mom
is on her way here.

15:07.465 --> 15:09.223
And they're gonna surprise her
for her 90th birthday.

15:09.317 --> 15:10.983
And it's great
and you're totally on board.

15:11.060 --> 15:12.301
Thanks for letting us
do this, Bob.

15:12.395 --> 15:14.061
You're gonna make my mom's
birthday so special.

15:14.155 --> 15:15.972
Also, doesn't the couch
look better over there?

15:16.065 --> 15:17.916
I think it does.
Isn't it great?

15:18.067 --> 15:19.809
Look at that couch
where it's meant to be.

15:19.827 --> 15:22.236
Oh, I love all of this so much.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.497
Okay, well, I guess
I'll go back downstairs

15:24.649 --> 15:26.907
and you guys
will keep doing this.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.484
Mom's here.
Victor's bringing her up.

15:28.577 --> 15:30.411
-Everyone, hide!
-Okay, good luck.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.912
Wait, Bob,
you can't go down yet.

15:32.006 --> 15:33.097
You'll ruin the surprise.

15:33.249 --> 15:35.082
But her mom
doesn't even know who I am.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.267
(shushes)
She's coming.

15:36.419 --> 15:37.751
But Teddy's alone
in the restaurant

15:37.771 --> 15:39.162
and you know I can't crouch.

15:39.255 --> 15:42.106
-S-Shush.
-Ow, I hate crouching. (groans)

15:42.183 --> 15:44.943
Well, this is Branca's
favorite spot, but no Branca.

15:45.094 --> 15:46.778
I thought our plan of spying
on him after school

15:46.854 --> 15:49.096
when there were no kids around
was a good one, but where is he?

15:49.190 --> 15:51.449
I don't know,
but this floor is really clean.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.933
Oops, not anymore.

15:53.011 --> 15:54.844
The Whaler ship
definitely looks different.

15:54.862 --> 15:56.955
Hmm.
I'm not great with ships.

15:57.106 --> 15:59.031
I know the cloth things
are called boat flaps.

15:59.184 --> 16:01.275
-(Branca moans)
-Wait, shh. Do you hear that?

16:01.294 --> 16:03.610
BRANCA:
Come on, glue. Be more sticky.

16:03.705 --> 16:05.964
-What's he doing?
-Gene, don't lean on me. Whoa!

16:06.191 --> 16:07.281
-(shouts)
-Who's there?

16:07.358 --> 16:09.375
What? This isn't
the after-school program

16:09.527 --> 16:11.118
for gifted
and talented children.

16:11.212 --> 16:13.362
Wait a minute, is that
the Wagstaff Whaler ship?

16:13.456 --> 16:17.976
No, this is a-a cleaning device
shaped like a ship.

16:18.127 --> 16:19.702
It's from Sweden.

16:19.795 --> 16:21.537
-Ooh.
-Uh-huh.
-Uh, fine.

16:21.556 --> 16:25.391
This is the Wagstaff's
precious Whaler model ship.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.967
Then what's the ship
in the case?

16:27.061 --> 16:29.153
It's a decoy ship
I put in there.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.472
I was cleaning the Whaler's case
a few days ago

16:31.566 --> 16:34.217
and it accidentally
dropped on the floor.

16:34.310 --> 16:38.145
Some of its little pieces broke
and I-I'm repairing it.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.739
Why didn't you just
tell people what happened

16:39.833 --> 16:41.666
instead of mopping
everyone away?

16:41.817 --> 16:43.001
Are you kidding me?

16:43.169 --> 16:44.744
Have you seen the way
the principal looks at it?

16:44.896 --> 16:46.395
It's his pride and joy.

16:46.414 --> 16:47.839
So, this is your plan?

16:47.990 --> 16:49.841
You're rebuilding it and then
you're gonna switch it back?

16:49.992 --> 16:51.843
Yes.
It's a good plan.

16:52.070 --> 16:53.569
I mean, it looks
a little different,

16:53.662 --> 16:55.404
but all the right pieces
are there.

16:55.498 --> 16:57.015
Mr. Branca, you little rascal.

16:57.166 --> 16:58.832
This is the most work
anyone's ever put

16:58.926 --> 17:00.351
into anything at this school.

17:00.503 --> 17:02.669
-I know.
-Hey, your secret's safe
with us.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.096
Yeah.
We can swap secrets.

17:04.249 --> 17:07.099
Mine is that I'm not the best
at keeping secrets.

17:07.252 --> 17:09.009
(both panting)

17:09.029 --> 17:10.753
Tina, we found out
what's up with Branca.

17:10.772 --> 17:12.513
Can't talk.
I think Tammy's in the darkroom

17:12.607 --> 17:14.757
destroying the negative
of the only good picture

17:14.850 --> 17:16.259
-I've ever taken.
-What?

17:16.427 --> 17:17.443
We're coming.
Come on, Gene.

17:17.595 --> 17:20.079
(grunting)
And I'm out of breath.

17:21.099 --> 17:22.874
-Tammy, no!
-Tina, I'm sorry,

17:23.101 --> 17:24.617
-but you left me no choice.
-Oh, my God.

17:24.769 --> 17:26.127
At least she said sorry?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.275
Tammy, I can't believe
you did that!

17:32.368 --> 17:33.776
I had to cut up your picture
and the negative, Tina,

17:33.795 --> 17:35.778
which took me a really long time
to find, by the way.

17:35.797 --> 17:37.221
Negatives are so small.

17:37.298 --> 17:39.799
Ugh, Tammy,
that was my best picture.

17:39.951 --> 17:41.617
I can't get suspended, Tina.

17:41.636 --> 17:43.377
My parents would kill me,
which means I wouldn't be able

17:43.471 --> 17:46.289
to go to Greece,
with Greek BFOG boys, remember?

17:46.307 --> 17:48.291
Ugh!
Think about what's important.

17:48.309 --> 17:50.068
Tina, you want us
to mess her up?

17:50.295 --> 17:52.052
Lock the door and make her
eat the negative?

17:52.072 --> 17:54.555
And maybe some of us take
a taste, too? Just to see?

17:54.649 --> 17:57.483
Okay, I'm gonna go 'cause it's
feeling kind of hostile in here.

17:57.635 --> 17:59.393
And I'm leaving and goodbye.
Have a good show.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.727
Aah!
Tammy.

18:00.789 --> 18:03.247
Okay, Mom, hold your boob
like you just got hit

18:03.399 --> 18:05.566
-with an orange.
-Like this, Ma. There you go.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.327
-Good.
Now, everyone look surprised.
-(shutter clicks)

18:08.479 --> 18:10.571
Beautiful.
Look at that.

18:10.665 --> 18:11.738
ALL:
Aw.

18:11.833 --> 18:13.591
What a wonderful birthday.

18:13.818 --> 18:16.168
-We used to live here.
-That's right, Ma.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.321
Well, we kept it clean
when we were here, though.

18:18.414 --> 18:21.432
-Okay.
-They really let
this place go, huh?

18:21.584 --> 18:23.159
Oh, you're fun.

18:23.252 --> 18:24.918
Linda's back. Bob,

18:25.012 --> 18:26.420
-Linda's back.
-I know, Teddy.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.681
-I see her.
-Violet and her family left.

18:28.833 --> 18:30.441
So, we'll see them tomorrow?

18:30.668 --> 18:32.426
When they come and repaint,
I'm guessing?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.279
No, I don't think so.
It's just so sweet.

18:35.431 --> 18:37.931
A family coming back,
reliving memories and the life

18:37.951 --> 18:39.008
they built together.

18:39.026 --> 18:40.451
That's gonna be us someday, pal.

18:40.603 --> 18:41.694
We're gonna move out
and come back

18:41.812 --> 18:43.195
and take a family photo.

18:43.348 --> 18:45.681
And I hope whoever's living here
helps us move the furniture.

18:45.700 --> 18:46.791
Where are we moving?

18:47.018 --> 18:48.701
I mean, we can't move
somewhere smaller.

18:48.853 --> 18:52.188
-Oh, Bob.
-Okay, Lin, yes,
it's actually very sweet.

18:52.206 --> 18:54.114
You're right.
But just so you know,

18:54.134 --> 18:55.616
if we move out and come back,

18:55.635 --> 18:58.169
I will never be able
to climb those stairs.

18:58.321 --> 19:00.379
I'll come by and give you
a hand up the stairs.

19:00.473 --> 19:04.049
Teddy, you'll also be old.
Why are you in such good shape?

19:04.126 --> 19:06.552
Diet, exercise
and I take a multivitamin.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.887
You got to take
care of yourself, Bob.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.039
Mmm.
Can I get more fries?

19:10.041 --> 19:11.407
TINA:
All of these pictures

19:11.467 --> 19:13.042
are terrible.
I can't use any of them.

19:13.060 --> 19:15.060
He may as well give me a D,
'cause I'm done.

19:15.213 --> 19:16.545
(sighs)
If I hadn't been so obsessed

19:16.639 --> 19:18.805
with going to Half House
and finally having all the fun

19:18.825 --> 19:20.140
I thought I was missing out on,

19:20.160 --> 19:21.642
then Tammy wouldn't have been
able to trick me.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.219
What am I gonna do?

19:23.312 --> 19:26.405
Well, what if you try to put
the negative back together?

19:26.482 --> 19:29.241
-What do you mean?
-I mean, it'll look
a little different,

19:29.394 --> 19:31.502
but all the right pieces
will be there.

19:31.654 --> 19:33.245
Oh, you Branca it.

19:33.398 --> 19:35.840
Yeah. And maybe
it'll be more interesting?

19:36.067 --> 19:38.067
You mean in, like,
a "different perspective" way?

19:38.160 --> 19:40.903
-That might work.
-Louise, hand me that garbage.

19:40.996 --> 19:43.589
Don't call me that!
Oh, right.

19:43.741 --> 19:44.665
<i> BOB:</i>
<i> Wow.</i>

19:44.759 --> 19:45.683
-It's good.
-LINDA: It's like

19:45.910 --> 19:47.000
an artsy-fartsy puzzle.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.168
-I love it.
-Thanks.

19:48.262 --> 19:49.503
Louise, Gene
and Susmita helped me.

19:49.597 --> 19:51.096
We get 50% if it sells.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.582
The price is a $150,000.

19:53.676 --> 19:56.602
Tina, nice twist on the theme.
Very interesting.

19:56.754 --> 19:59.864
Thanks, it was always my plan
to do this, the whole time.

20:00.091 --> 20:02.591
-So, no D train?
-No D train for you, Tina.

20:02.593 --> 20:05.428
-What's D train?
-Oh, uh, just
a photography term.

20:05.446 --> 20:07.872
I'm a great student.
Uh, hey, look, there's Susmita!

20:08.023 --> 20:09.448
Hey, Susmita, no D train for me.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.767
-Nice.
-You know, taking pictures
with you this week

20:11.860 --> 20:14.453
was way more fun than the fun
I imagined having at Half House.

20:14.605 --> 20:16.547
Yeah, it's a half
torn-down house.

20:16.699 --> 20:18.699
And I sat on a bunch
of cigarette butts.

20:18.867 --> 20:19.866
Yeah.

20:19.961 --> 20:21.460
Psst.
Louise, Gene.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.447
The Whaler is fixed. I've got
to get it back in its case

20:24.465 --> 20:26.115
but everyone's gonna be looking.

20:26.133 --> 20:28.542
Just wait until after the show
and put it back then.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.636
I can't.
I heard the principal's coming.

20:30.788 --> 20:33.547
-He'll want to see his baby.
-Okay, got it.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.790
Gene, get ready.

20:34.883 --> 20:36.383
Hey, everyone,
look how much cheese

20:36.444 --> 20:38.477
my brother can fit in his mouth.

20:38.629 --> 20:39.962
Yeah!
(mumbling)

20:39.981 --> 20:41.630
LOUISE:
He's a marvel of science!

20:41.649 --> 20:42.573
(Gene mumbling)

20:42.725 --> 20:43.741
Thank you.

20:43.892 --> 20:45.058
Hey, Tina,
no hard feelings, right?

20:45.078 --> 20:46.244
I mean, some hard feelings.

20:46.395 --> 20:48.637
-Is that your picture, Tammy?
-Yeah.

20:48.772 --> 20:50.748
-It's a self-portrait.
-What's in your nose?

20:50.899 --> 20:52.866
-Is that a booger?
-What? No.

20:52.977 --> 20:54.919
-Gross.
-It's a shadow.

20:55.070 --> 20:56.403
A booger-shaped shadow.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.589
Shut up! Stop!
Nobody look!
