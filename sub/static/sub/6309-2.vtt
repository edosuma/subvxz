09:32.326 --> 09:34.461
JENKINS: How do you
know about the Library?

09:34.462 --> 09:38.398
The guardians of all
treasures magic and strange?

09:38.399 --> 09:40.434
I've wandered the Earth
for centuries now.

09:40.435 --> 09:44.071
It would be impossible
to not hear of thee.

09:44.072 --> 09:48.342
And now we walk the
path o'power, we three.

09:48.343 --> 09:52.846
Um... I will not aid you.

09:52.847 --> 09:54.481
As a fellow gentlemen of intellect,

09:54.482 --> 09:57.050
I'd suggest you cooperate.
It'll go easier on you.

09:57.051 --> 09:58.785
[Chuckles] Oh, please.

09:58.786 --> 10:01.321
Uh, you know, I-I usually
resist playing this card...

10:01.322 --> 10:03.457
well, at least in supernatural circles...

10:03.458 --> 10:06.860
do you know who I am?

10:06.861 --> 10:09.162
You've a trace of an
accent that you hide well,

10:09.163 --> 10:10.464
but not completely.

10:10.465 --> 10:12.165
Something between Germanic and Celtic,

10:12.166 --> 10:14.201
suggesting Ancient Britain.

10:14.202 --> 10:15.969
From your stature

10:15.970 --> 10:19.039
and the shaking of your
fingers in your sword hand,

10:19.040 --> 10:21.141
the way you stand here unafraid,

10:21.142 --> 10:23.543
I'd venture to say you
were a man of action.

10:23.544 --> 10:26.013
A noted one.

10:26.014 --> 10:28.115
The logical deduction would be

10:28.116 --> 10:30.696
you're a Knight of the Round Table.

10:31.953 --> 10:35.422
Or <i> were.</i> A former knight, yes?

10:35.423 --> 10:39.459
Um, uh, well, my point, though, is,

10:39.460 --> 10:42.462
I've been threatened, tortured,

10:42.463 --> 10:47.520
and bullied, bothered, grilled,
menaced long since before

10:47.521 --> 10:50.820
you two were even a glimmer
in your writers ink pot.

10:50.821 --> 10:54.592
I will never lead you to your staff.

10:54.593 --> 10:57.928
My staff? 'Tis broken.

10:57.929 --> 10:59.597
Surely that you know.

10:59.598 --> 11:03.300
I came here in pursuit of bigger prize.

11:04.636 --> 11:06.904
My first staff was forged

11:06.905 --> 11:10.474
of a branch of the Tree of Knowledge.

11:10.475 --> 11:13.444
[Whispers] I would have another.

11:13.445 --> 11:18.616
And so the Library's heart
is where I've set my eyes.

11:18.617 --> 11:20.217
[Grunts]

11:20.218 --> 11:21.585
Cassandra, move.

11:21.586 --> 11:23.254
[Alarm continues blaring]

11:23.255 --> 11:25.156
Forget about it, mate.

11:25.157 --> 11:27.358
If I can't get those
doors open, no one can.

11:27.359 --> 11:28.659
We gotta do something.

11:28.660 --> 11:31.062
All right? Prospero has got Jenkins.

11:31.063 --> 11:32.630
Nobody knows the Library like him.

11:32.631 --> 11:34.398
Jenkins would never help him.

11:34.399 --> 11:36.133
Well, he got Jenkins to lock us out.

11:36.134 --> 11:38.169
Maybe he's able to, like,
control him somehow.

11:38.170 --> 11:40.004
I highly that doubt that.

11:40.005 --> 11:43.340
This is an Alpha alert,
lowest level of security.

11:43.341 --> 11:45.376
If Prospero did have
Jenkins under control,

11:45.377 --> 11:47.144
he'd have set off an Omega alert,

11:47.145 --> 11:49.613
which means you wouldn't be
about to chop down that door.

11:49.614 --> 11:52.383
You'd be a big pile of ash
in a nice set of work boots.

11:52.384 --> 11:54.518
Jenkins is playing along?

11:54.519 --> 11:55.986
He set a low level security

11:55.987 --> 11:57.321
so they'd think he was cooperating.

11:57.322 --> 12:00.157
Exactly. An Alpha alert
has that backdoor.

12:00.158 --> 12:01.525
Wait, it does?

12:01.526 --> 12:04.728
Am I the only one that reads
the security manuals?

12:04.729 --> 12:06.630
There's a hidden passcode

12:06.631 --> 12:10.404
in case a Librarian or Guardian
ever needed to get back in.

12:10.405 --> 12:11.922
What is it?! Ugh!

12:11.923 --> 12:14.738
Well, stop playing with
your phone and find it!

12:14.739 --> 12:16.674
It's simple.

12:16.675 --> 12:19.543
We go to the library, the local one.

12:19.544 --> 12:21.312
[Grunts]
[Board thuds]

12:21.313 --> 12:23.380
[Exhales]

12:23.381 --> 12:25.416
Ooh! My knees.

12:25.417 --> 12:28.085
[Groans, grunts]

12:28.086 --> 12:30.386
[Heavy thud]
[Blows air]

12:31.323 --> 12:33.524
It's locked.

12:33.525 --> 12:35.092
With some sort of code.

12:35.093 --> 12:36.760
[Blows air]

12:36.761 --> 12:39.263
"The Guns Bind Gab."

12:39.264 --> 12:40.564
Bind... gab.

12:40.565 --> 12:42.633
Words we don't say.

12:42.634 --> 12:44.201
No, "Macbeth" again?

12:44.202 --> 12:46.570
No, there's no quotes
about guns in "Macbeth."

12:46.571 --> 12:49.507
If it's a code, we need some
sort of cypher to solve it.

12:49.508 --> 12:52.076
Unless it's a self-contained anagram.

12:52.077 --> 12:54.345
Ooh! I like anagrams.

12:54.346 --> 12:58.595
Guns bind gab.
Guns bind gab.

12:58.596 --> 13:01.465
No, uh...

13:01.466 --> 13:04.301
Bathings... bunged.

13:04.302 --> 13:07.304
- Now that better not be it.
- No.

13:07.305 --> 13:09.473
Bad... begins...

13:09.474 --> 13:11.174
- Ah!
- Hmm?

13:11.175 --> 13:15.178
"Things bad begun makes
strong themselves with ill."

13:15.179 --> 13:17.447
"Macbeth," Act III, Scene II.

13:17.448 --> 13:19.216
Uh, you were a stage
manager in high school.

13:19.217 --> 13:23.053
I was Lady Macbeth, and I <i> was</i> amazing.

13:23.054 --> 13:26.623
Act III, Scene II. Three...

13:26.624 --> 13:28.392
Scene... two.

13:28.393 --> 13:29.726
[Lock clicks]

13:29.727 --> 13:32.262
[Clank]

13:32.263 --> 13:33.597
- Get ready, Eve.
- Okay.

13:33.598 --> 13:35.098
You're about to feast your eyes

13:35.099 --> 13:37.599
on the pieces of Prospero's staff.

13:42.340 --> 13:44.508
Smaller than I'd thought.

13:48.246 --> 13:51.782
"Not yet, but soon and long ago.

13:51.783 --> 13:53.483
"I pray your journey

13:53.484 --> 13:56.753
- does not end in woe."
- [Gasps]

13:56.754 --> 14:00.524
Whoa. "The Librarian"?

14:00.525 --> 14:02.359
Some other Librarian from 400 years ago

14:02.360 --> 14:04.161
beat us here.

14:04.162 --> 14:06.863
Took the staff pieces and
left an annoying note.

14:06.864 --> 14:11.134
If a Librarian left that note,
the staff isn't here...

14:11.135 --> 14:12.903
It's back in the Library.

14:14.439 --> 14:16.706
- Docent.
- I got it.

14:19.677 --> 14:22.512
- Uh, excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes, may I help you?

14:22.513 --> 14:25.449
Yes, I need to check out a book.
It's an emergency.

14:25.450 --> 14:27.517
May I please see your library card?

14:27.518 --> 14:30.120
Oh, I-I don't have a card, but...

14:30.121 --> 14:32.255
well, I'm the Librarian. [Chuckles]

14:32.256 --> 14:33.790
You're Jane Stevens?

14:33.791 --> 14:36.793
No. No, no, no, I, um, I'm...

14:36.794 --> 14:39.696
the Librarian. [Chuckles]

14:39.697 --> 14:41.364
Uh, from a different library.

14:41.365 --> 14:43.366
But I do need to check out a book.

14:43.367 --> 14:44.801
Any book?

14:44.802 --> 14:47.304
No, the one book that is
in every single library...

14:47.305 --> 14:49.506
"The Complete Works of
William Shakespeare,

14:49.507 --> 14:51.341
- Unabridged."
- Oh, I'm sorry.

14:51.342 --> 14:55.412
Our only copy was just checked out.

14:55.413 --> 14:57.347
Huh?

14:57.348 --> 15:00.717
Hey, hey, excuse me, excuse me.
Little girl, hi. [Laughs] Hi.

15:00.718 --> 15:04.454
How are you? Listen,
we... we need that book.

15:04.455 --> 15:07.157
- I just checked it out.
- Yeah, I know, sweetie,

15:07.158 --> 15:08.525
but we need it for official business.

15:08.526 --> 15:10.760
See, we're the Librarians.

15:10.761 --> 15:12.496
You're not Mrs. Stevens.

15:12.497 --> 15:14.464
No, no, but we do, however,

15:14.465 --> 15:15.932
appreciate your dedication
to learning, huh?

15:15.933 --> 15:17.634
Yeah, it is very admirable.

15:17.635 --> 15:20.303
And we're very impressed you
read such a grown-up book.

15:20.304 --> 15:22.672
Look, we need that book
back, or something very bad

15:22.673 --> 15:24.574
is gonna happen to a lot of people,

15:24.575 --> 15:26.209
and you don't want that, do you?

15:26.210 --> 15:27.511
Give me 50 bucks.

15:27.512 --> 15:28.712
- What?
- What?

15:28.713 --> 15:30.400
No, we... we don't wanna buy it from you.

15:30.401 --> 15:32.446
- We just want you to g...
- 50 bucks.

15:33.518 --> 15:35.852
Now you listen to me,
young lady. We're...

15:35.853 --> 15:37.420
$75.

15:37.421 --> 15:38.889
I like her.

15:38.890 --> 15:40.423
Tick, tick.

15:41.759 --> 15:44.427
You want me to lead you to
the heart of the Library?

15:44.428 --> 15:46.296
Clearly, you are out of your mind.

15:46.297 --> 15:49.466
Not out my mind. I am but out my book.

15:49.467 --> 15:51.334
I cannot lead you to
the heart of the Library.

15:51.335 --> 15:53.537
Former Knight or not, I'm sure
with the right inducement...

15:53.538 --> 15:55.739
No, no, I'm sorry, you misunderstand.

15:55.740 --> 15:58.575
I am <i> literally</i> not capable
of doing it right now.

15:58.576 --> 15:59.809
Shows no signs of lying.

15:59.810 --> 16:01.811
We'll have to look for it on our own.

16:01.812 --> 16:03.914
And quickly. He's clearly
trying to stall us.

16:03.915 --> 16:06.683
Ah! You can look all you want.
You're not going to find it.

16:06.684 --> 16:09.653
The heart of the Library
doesn't even exist

16:09.654 --> 16:13.456
on the same extradimensional
plane as the Library itself.

16:13.457 --> 16:15.926
What don't you forget about it?
Give it up.

16:15.927 --> 16:17.527
I'm sure we could work something out...

16:17.528 --> 16:21.498
The heart hides in a
separate fold of space?

16:21.499 --> 16:25.335
No wonder our dear
friend was so displaced.

16:25.336 --> 16:27.804
- I...
- [Whoosh, cracking sound]

16:27.805 --> 16:32.575
Ariel, take us to the gateway
to the heart of the Library.

16:34.312 --> 16:36.546
[Alarm continues blaring]
[Whoosh]

16:36.547 --> 16:38.548
Oh, you're back!

16:38.549 --> 16:40.016
- What?!
- You're back!

16:40.017 --> 16:41.751
- What?!
- You're back!

16:41.752 --> 16:43.320
- Hang on.
- [Alarm stops]

16:43.321 --> 16:44.921
- What?
- Wait, how did you teleport back

16:44.922 --> 16:46.790
- without using that door?
- I can use any door.

16:46.791 --> 16:48.291
- You can?
- You <i> can't?</i>

16:48.292 --> 16:49.526
- We have a problem.
- I know.

16:49.527 --> 16:50.760
- The staff is here.
- Prospero is here.

16:50.761 --> 16:52.429
- Wait. What?
- Wait. What?

16:52.430 --> 16:54.297
We received this note
from a previous Librarian,

16:54.298 --> 16:55.999
saying that the staff had been
removed from where we thought

16:56.000 --> 16:57.834
it was hidden, and hidden
somewhere in this Library.

16:57.835 --> 16:59.810
Prospero broke in while
you guys were gone.

16:59.811 --> 17:00.470
Seriously?!

17:00.471 --> 17:02.505
This is the third time
this place has broken into

17:02.506 --> 17:03.740
since I started working here.

17:03.741 --> 17:05.008
We're gonna have to have a serious talk

17:05.009 --> 17:06.843
about this so-called security system.

17:06.844 --> 17:08.877
He made Jenkins put the place
on lockdown. We're shut out.

17:08.878 --> 17:10.480
Okay, nobody panic!

17:10.481 --> 17:13.415
This is an Alpha level alert.
It's an easy fix.

17:13.416 --> 17:15.050
What we need to open these doors is...

17:15.051 --> 17:17.587
- Yeah, we were just about to...
- Yes, that.

17:17.588 --> 17:19.055
But to get the passcode, what we're gonna

17:19.056 --> 17:20.690
- have to figure out...
- Year, date, day, hour, minute,

17:20.691 --> 17:23.059
divided by the corresponding
coefficient play,

17:23.060 --> 17:25.561
act, scene, word...

17:25.563 --> 17:27.030
I'll have it in three, two, one...

17:27.031 --> 17:29.432
- Portents.
- [Alarm beeps]

17:29.433 --> 17:30.800
Very good.

17:30.801 --> 17:34.003
I see you've all passed my test.

17:35.673 --> 17:38.475
MORIARTY: And if our foes
gain entrance to the library?

17:38.476 --> 17:40.510
They lack Ariel to find the heart.

17:40.511 --> 17:43.747
If what the knight says is true,
they won't be able to follow us.

17:43.748 --> 17:45.482
Yet perhaps we need some aid.

17:45.483 --> 17:48.518
The brains are yours. Now...

17:48.519 --> 17:51.855
let the brawn be made.

17:51.856 --> 17:53.857
[Blows air]

18:04.035 --> 18:05.902
[Blows air]

18:21.986 --> 18:25.116
Welcome to Team Fictional.

18:33.549 --> 18:34.949
BAIRD: Jenkins!

18:34.950 --> 18:37.107
What do we do? Do we thaw him out?

18:37.108 --> 18:38.474
If it's representational magic,

18:38.475 --> 18:40.209
can we symbolically melt him somehow?

18:40.210 --> 18:41.844
Not if it's a binding spell.

18:41.845 --> 18:43.779
Once in Shanglow, the
city beneath Shanghai,

18:43.780 --> 18:46.148
I was under a binding spell so
powerful that mere thought...

18:46.149 --> 18:47.449
[Grunts]
[Ice shatters]

18:47.450 --> 18:48.918
[Grunts]

18:48.919 --> 18:50.352
- [Exhales] What?
- Oh!

18:50.353 --> 18:52.976
The job's not all about
obscure knowledge, people.

18:52.977 --> 18:56.438
Sir, Prospero's here, and
he has Moriarty with him

18:56.439 --> 18:59.742
and a celestial being
locked inside a pocket watch.

18:59.743 --> 19:01.877
- CASSANDRA AND STONE: Ariel.
- Where is his staff?

19:01.878 --> 19:03.746
He's not after his staff, sir.
He's after something worse,

19:03.747 --> 19:06.949
uh, which I may have compounded
with a tactical error.

19:06.950 --> 19:09.018
- It's been that kind of a day.
- He's after a new staff,

19:09.019 --> 19:13.856
and he's going to the heart
of the Library to get it.

19:13.857 --> 19:15.991
There's a staff in the
heart of the Library?

19:15.992 --> 19:17.193
- No.
- Um...

19:17.194 --> 19:20.312
A tree. The Tree of Knowledge.

19:20.313 --> 19:22.364
The Tree of Knowledge
is the heart of the Library?

19:22.365 --> 19:25.000
If he makes a new staff
from the wood of that tree,

19:25.001 --> 19:26.435
we are powerless against it.

19:26.436 --> 19:27.531
Then we have to get there first.

19:27.532 --> 19:28.967
Jenkins, how do we get to the heart?

19:28.968 --> 19:31.436
There's an elevator. I've
never been there. I don't...

19:31.437 --> 19:32.904
I have no idea, sir.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.907
That's where the compounded
tactical error comes in.

19:35.908 --> 19:39.845
The Library is, um, out of order.

19:39.846 --> 19:43.949
Out of order? Would you all
excuse us for a moment?

19:45.451 --> 19:48.987
Ever since the Library
returned, it's been...

19:48.988 --> 19:50.937
How do I say this? Uh... off.

19:50.938 --> 19:53.606
Off? How?

19:53.607 --> 19:56.576
Rooms missing, hallways unaccounted for.

19:56.577 --> 19:58.044
I've tried mapping it, but it's unstable.

19:58.045 --> 19:59.879
It's changing without...
without any warning.

19:59.880 --> 20:03.583
And... [Sighs] then there
are the missing artifacts.

20:03.584 --> 20:05.652
Whoo. [Exhales deeply]

20:05.653 --> 20:08.221
Library's missing artifacts?

20:08.222 --> 20:09.923
16, last count.

20:09.924 --> 20:11.691
When were you gonna say something?

20:11.692 --> 20:13.760
Sir, I thought I could figure it out

20:13.761 --> 20:15.028
before anyone found out.

20:15.029 --> 20:16.563
Tactical error on my part.

20:16.564 --> 20:18.565
Which we will be
discussing later at length.

20:18.566 --> 20:20.833
- Yes, sir.
- However, at the moment, if that's true,

20:20.834 --> 20:22.769
we don't know how to get to the heart.

20:22.770 --> 20:24.804
No, but with Ariel, Prospero does.

20:24.805 --> 20:26.706
It will lead him there.

20:26.707 --> 20:29.509
Okay, assuming I'm reading
these right, and hey,

20:29.510 --> 20:33.246
magical maps, no guarantees,
<i>these</i> rooms haven't shifted.

20:33.247 --> 20:35.114
They're the same in all the maps.

20:35.115 --> 20:36.583
You're right. That's the annex.

20:36.584 --> 20:37.884
That's the only actual connection point

20:37.885 --> 20:39.552
between the outside
world and the Library,

20:39.553 --> 20:41.955
- so that stays stable.
- And also the antiquities room.

20:41.956 --> 20:44.624
It's the oldest room in this
incarnation of the Library,

20:44.625 --> 20:46.826
the bedrock on which
everything else was built.

20:46.827 --> 20:48.127
Oh, and the reading room.

20:48.128 --> 20:49.729
The largest collection of actual books,

20:49.730 --> 20:51.130
the iconic image of the Library.

20:51.131 --> 20:53.132
Well, three points is all
you need for an Intel.

20:53.133 --> 20:54.734
- If we triangulate...
- Triangulate!

20:54.735 --> 20:56.803
Triangulate the Library,
like a Rubik's Cube.

20:56.804 --> 20:58.324
No matter which way
you twist it or turn it,

20:58.325 --> 20:59.839
the center always stays the same.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.941
If you can line those up,
you can solve it in seconds.

21:01.942 --> 21:04.577
- Six seconds, not to brag.
- If you triangulate, uh,

21:04.578 --> 21:06.827
you'll need some sort of
a detection device, Jenkins.

21:06.828 --> 21:07.814
I'm assuming you have...

21:07.815 --> 21:10.249
I have some magical surveying
equipment to track ley lines.

21:10.250 --> 21:12.185
Good, we will triangulate the Library.

21:12.186 --> 21:14.295
To find the heart, I suggest we
split up. Two people to a room.

21:14.296 --> 21:16.305
Jenkins, why don't you and
Cassandra anchor the Annex?

21:16.306 --> 21:17.322
- Yes, sir.
- Eve, why don't...

21:17.323 --> 21:18.820
I'll take Stone, go to the reading room.

21:18.821 --> 21:20.891
- You and Ezekiel take antiquities.
- 'Cause I thought we'd... we'd,

21:20.892 --> 21:22.144
- Great.
- Okay.

21:25.095 --> 21:28.097
Ah! The sprite has found
the final passage

21:28.098 --> 21:31.467
to the Library's heart.

21:31.468 --> 21:32.768
[Exhales]

21:38.475 --> 21:39.909
[Whoosh]

21:39.910 --> 21:42.044
[Sighs] They've made it to the elevator.

21:42.045 --> 21:44.580
It'll take them straight
to the heart. [Sighs]

21:44.581 --> 21:46.015
If you didn't tell us something was off

21:46.016 --> 21:47.917
with the Library, I'm sure
you had a good reason.

21:47.918 --> 21:50.719
Ah, a reason. Hmm, yes.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.688
A good one?

21:54.224 --> 21:56.659
I thought it was me.

21:58.161 --> 22:00.896
Judson always kept the
Library such shipshape,

22:00.897 --> 22:03.666
I...didn't want anybody
to know that I couldn't.

22:03.667 --> 22:05.968
I-I thought, Oh, you know,
I'll keep it quiet,

22:05.969 --> 22:07.770
then I'll have a bit of
time to figure it out.

22:07.771 --> 22:11.006
Get the Library to trust
me like it did Judson.

22:11.007 --> 22:15.477
Now, ego... Ms. Cillian, ego
and fear were my reasons.

22:15.478 --> 22:19.081
[Crackling]

22:19.082 --> 22:21.517
Whoa! What the...

22:21.518 --> 22:23.953
Don't move.

22:23.954 --> 22:26.488
[Lowered voice] The antiquity
hall's in the right place,

22:26.489 --> 22:28.657
but the Greek and Roman wings
seemed to have jumbled.

22:28.658 --> 22:29.925
[Whispers] Oh, the Spear of Ares

22:29.926 --> 22:31.193
and the Spear of Mars

22:31.194 --> 22:32.995
are only a few feet from each other.

22:34.230 --> 22:36.999
The helmets of Mercury and
Hermes are almost touching.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.325
And the lightning bolt of
Zeus is out of its case.

22:39.326 --> 22:41.270
Okay, do you know how lucky
we are that this whole place

22:41.271 --> 22:43.105
hasn't blown sky high already?

22:43.106 --> 22:45.674
[Whispers] Very, very lucky.

22:45.675 --> 22:47.042
[Lowered voice] See, the Romans copied

22:47.043 --> 22:48.510
Greek mythology and they
changed all the names,

22:48.511 --> 22:49.778
so there's two sets of artifacts.

22:49.779 --> 22:51.246
And if they come into contact,

22:51.247 --> 22:53.048
it is like matter and anti-matter.

22:53.049 --> 22:55.284
Or like meeting your own
counterpart in the Mirrorlands.

22:55.285 --> 22:57.620
Do you understand that?

22:57.621 --> 23:00.756
If we don't keep them separate... boom!

23:00.757 --> 23:02.091
This whole room is basically

23:02.092 --> 23:05.060
one big, giant ticking magical bomb.

23:05.061 --> 23:07.863
[Crackling continues]

23:07.864 --> 23:09.632
[Whispers] Yeah.

23:09.633 --> 23:11.000
[Whispers] Too bad we don't have

23:11.001 --> 23:13.702
one of those big bomb suits, eh?

23:15.171 --> 23:19.875
What is that?
W-why is your eyebrow moving?

23:21.011 --> 23:22.711
All right, this has gotta be the place.

23:22.712 --> 23:25.948
I'm gonna set up. Center of the room.

23:30.854 --> 23:32.721
[Scoffs]

23:32.722 --> 23:34.923
Blank pages.

23:34.924 --> 23:37.192
"Alice in Wonderland."

23:37.193 --> 23:40.796
Oh. Love "Alice."
It's one of my favorites.

23:40.797 --> 23:43.699
"Frankenstein."

23:43.700 --> 23:45.167
[Book thuds]

23:48.004 --> 23:49.304
Off with your heads!

23:49.305 --> 23:52.241
[Laughing]

23:52.242 --> 23:54.730
Didn't see that one coming.

23:58.366 --> 24:02.235
Off... with... their... heads!

24:02.236 --> 24:03.737
[Laughs]

24:03.738 --> 24:05.305
It's another Fictional.

24:05.306 --> 24:07.474
He summoned the Red Queen
from "Alice in Wonderland."

24:07.475 --> 24:10.444
No, that's the Queen of Hearts.

24:10.445 --> 24:12.446
Red Queen is from
"Through the Looking-Glass."

24:12.447 --> 24:13.847
There's a difference?

24:14.148 --> 24:16.049
Off with their heads,
off with their heads,

24:16.050 --> 24:17.851
off with their heads. [Laughs]

24:17.852 --> 24:21.154
[Grunting]

24:21.155 --> 24:22.522
[Glass shatters]

24:22.523 --> 24:28.228
[Grunting continues]

24:28.229 --> 24:30.931
Baird! This is wrong. [Laughs]

24:30.932 --> 24:32.299
In the books, she ordered the beheadings,

24:32.300 --> 24:34.301
but it clearly states
that they were pardoned.

24:34.302 --> 24:39.456
Don't nitpick the crazy ax lady!

24:41.326 --> 24:43.460
EZEKIEL: You're sure this is safe?

24:43.461 --> 24:46.897
The Bracer of Agamemnon,
the gauntlets of Athena,

24:46.898 --> 24:48.499
the Helm of Poseidon.
You're all Greeked up.

24:48.500 --> 24:53.537
There is no way that Zeus's
lightning rod will strike you.

24:53.538 --> 24:56.140
[Exhales sharply]

24:56.141 --> 24:57.474
Ah. I saw that.

24:57.475 --> 24:58.942
What?! I'm getting
comfortable over here.

24:58.943 --> 25:00.944
I'm watching your show of expertise.

25:00.945 --> 25:03.280
You have never liked me.

25:03.281 --> 25:05.349
Now's not the time for that.

25:05.350 --> 25:07.151
[Sighs]

25:07.152 --> 25:09.419
[Crackling]

25:19.998 --> 25:21.365
[Whoosh]

25:21.366 --> 25:24.401
Whoa. I didn't know that it did that.

25:24.402 --> 25:27.604
Well, if you're okay with it,

25:27.605 --> 25:29.606
can we finally set up

25:29.607 --> 25:33.443
that ley line surveying Doo... Ooh.

25:33.444 --> 25:35.445
Aah!

25:36.981 --> 25:38.916
Frankenstein's Monster.

25:38.917 --> 25:41.585
What is taking them so long?

25:41.586 --> 25:43.921
Prospero's descended another level.

25:43.922 --> 25:46.056
When this happens in the movies,
don't they try to, like,

25:46.057 --> 25:47.491
override the elevator or something?

25:47.492 --> 25:49.693
Indeed, they do, yes, but
in the movies, usually,

25:49.694 --> 25:52.029
the elevators were made
<i>after</i> the Reformation.

25:52.030 --> 25:56.667
[Giggling]

25:58.369 --> 26:02.539
Off... with... your head. [Laughs]

26:03.942 --> 26:06.076
[Lowered voice] Any ideas?

26:06.077 --> 26:08.412
[Whispering] Flynn said
Fictionals don't have free will.

26:08.413 --> 26:10.347
They're bound by the
nature of their story.

26:10.348 --> 26:12.082
Maybe we can use that against her.

26:12.083 --> 26:15.552
Okay, okay, okay, how does
Alice defeat her in the book?

26:15.553 --> 26:16.987
Well, she doesn't.

26:16.988 --> 26:19.990
She just wakes up. It's all a dream.

26:19.991 --> 26:21.525
[Grunts]

26:21.526 --> 26:24.494
[Queen cackling]

26:24.495 --> 26:26.463
Was worth a shot.

26:26.464 --> 26:28.098
[Red Queen giggling]

26:28.099 --> 26:30.601
Okay, if we can't beat
her, do we banish her?

26:30.602 --> 26:33.270
Send her back to Wonderland?

26:33.271 --> 26:35.239
The only way to Wonderland's
through the rabbit hole.

26:35.240 --> 26:36.707
[Gasps] Or...

26:36.708 --> 26:38.475
BOTH: Through the looking-glass.

26:38.476 --> 26:41.578
Okay, you keep her distracted
with Wonderland... stuff.

26:41.579 --> 26:43.046
I'll look for lights.

26:43.047 --> 26:46.149
[Giggles]

26:48.086 --> 26:51.288
Off with your... head.

26:52.624 --> 26:54.691
[Click]

26:54.692 --> 26:56.493
Yah! Ha!

26:56.494 --> 26:59.296
Back! Back, you! Ha! Yah! Back!

26:59.297 --> 27:02.633
Frankenstein's Monster...
he hates fire, right?

27:02.634 --> 27:04.735
In the movie, not the book.

27:04.736 --> 27:06.236
There's a difference?

27:06.237 --> 27:08.238
I hold no hate for fire.

27:08.239 --> 27:11.475
My hate is reserved
for those who abhor me,

27:11.476 --> 27:13.143
meaning thee, man,

27:13.144 --> 27:15.512
who fancies himself in
the image of the divine

27:15.513 --> 27:17.514
and yet vilifies me as monster!

27:17.515 --> 27:18.654
[Blows air]

27:18.655 --> 27:20.421
- Okay, there's a difference.
- [Lighter clicks shut]

27:20.422 --> 27:22.386
[Whispers] The original text
is very long-winded.

27:22.387 --> 27:24.746
- Ow! Oh!
- If you do not find my words concise,

27:24.747 --> 27:26.847
take my actions to be so.

27:26.848 --> 27:28.783
I was brought forth to kill thee.

27:28.784 --> 27:31.052
A-actually, you were not
brought forth to kill.

27:31.053 --> 27:33.788
- Seems very kill-y to me.
- Shut up.

27:33.789 --> 27:35.790
You only killed because of despair,

27:35.791 --> 27:38.059
once you'd been abandoned
by your creator,

27:38.060 --> 27:40.161
after you felt that the world
had... had turned on you,

27:40.162 --> 27:42.664
hated you, uh, feared you.

27:42.665 --> 27:46.735
"If I cannot inspire love,
then I will cause fear."

27:46.736 --> 27:48.603
Those were your words.

27:48.604 --> 27:51.673
[Grunts, gasps]

27:51.674 --> 27:54.843
You never wanted to kill.
You just wanted to belong.

27:54.844 --> 28:00.749
And I refuse to fear you
and I refuse to hate you.

28:00.750 --> 28:02.450
Come here.

28:02.451 --> 28:03.952
Come on.

28:03.953 --> 28:06.955
Hug it out.

28:06.956 --> 28:10.024
Hug it out for humanity.

28:10.025 --> 28:13.161
Yes!

28:13.162 --> 28:16.197
There's no need for violence.

28:16.198 --> 28:20.135
This is how Librarians solve problems,

28:20.136 --> 28:23.138
with our minds...

28:23.139 --> 28:25.840
and our hearts.

28:25.841 --> 28:28.309
[Whines]

28:30.279 --> 28:33.014
- A fool's dream!
- Worth a shot. Worth a shot.

28:33.015 --> 28:35.717
- [Chokes]
- Taunt me not with my heart's desire.

28:35.718 --> 28:37.519
What admiration could
even a single being show

28:37.520 --> 28:41.022
to such a fearsome visage as mine?

28:41.023 --> 28:45.193
What remedy can there be
for one so foul as me?

28:45.194 --> 28:47.896
[High-pitched voice]
Little plastic surgery, maybe!

28:47.897 --> 28:49.664
What?

28:49.665 --> 28:52.634
Actually, he's right.
This isn't the 1800s.

28:52.635 --> 28:55.870
Modern medicine can fix your... visage.

28:55.871 --> 28:58.239
Yeah, and with that size
and those reflexes,

28:58.240 --> 29:00.975
you ever considered playing
professional sports?

29:00.976 --> 29:02.544
[Grunts]

29:02.545 --> 29:05.313
You wouldn't be adored by a single being.

29:05.314 --> 29:08.082
You'd be adored by millions.

29:09.185 --> 29:12.053
Yeah. [Mutters] Yeah.

29:16.859 --> 29:18.593
[Giggles] Off with your...

29:18.594 --> 29:20.261
Hey, hey, Queen!

29:20.262 --> 29:21.996
You.

29:21.997 --> 29:25.567
You Wonderland girls, you
like wordplay, don'tcha?

29:25.568 --> 29:26.768
Well, here's one for you...

29:26.769 --> 29:30.772
Why is a raven like a writing desk?

29:30.773 --> 29:33.716
[Laughs] Because there's a "b" in both.

29:33.717 --> 29:36.811
- What? There's no... Should've just ran!
- Off with your head! [Cackling]

29:36.812 --> 29:39.314
I hope Flynn and Ezekiel
are having an easier time.

29:39.315 --> 29:42.684
So you say I just swipe right?

29:42.685 --> 29:44.118
- Exactly.
- [Cell phone chimes and buzzes]

29:44.119 --> 29:46.087
Hey! You already have a match.

29:46.088 --> 29:48.656
She's cute.

29:48.657 --> 29:50.792
Now!

29:50.793 --> 29:53.361
[Queen giggling]

29:53.362 --> 29:55.129
[Laughing]

29:55.130 --> 29:57.298
Hey, Queenie!

29:58.701 --> 30:02.003
- Off with your...
- [Switch clicks]

30:02.004 --> 30:03.705
head!

30:05.174 --> 30:07.141
[Exhales deeply]

30:13.182 --> 30:15.717
Nothing but a deck of cards.

30:17.786 --> 30:20.321
[Whoosh]

30:20.322 --> 30:23.258
[Whoosh]

30:23.259 --> 30:24.859
[Whoosh]

30:24.860 --> 30:26.261
There. They've made it.

30:26.262 --> 30:28.029
What happens now?

30:28.030 --> 30:33.968
[Whooshing]

30:33.969 --> 30:35.737
We've triangulated the center.

30:35.738 --> 30:37.906
Okay, the energy from the ley line

30:37.907 --> 30:39.507
should take us right to it.

30:40.976 --> 30:43.077
I'll stay here and keep it steady.

30:46.382 --> 30:48.950
[Grunts] I gotta hold it down.

30:48.951 --> 30:51.519
You go.

30:55.190 --> 30:57.792
We've run out of time.
They have reached the heart.

31:01.096 --> 31:03.831
[Whoosh]

31:06.869 --> 31:08.236
[Whoosh]

31:14.398 --> 31:17.032
[Panting]

31:17.033 --> 31:18.367
Flynn!

31:18.368 --> 31:20.335
Ah! Good.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.704
It's you. You made it.

31:21.705 --> 31:23.205
Yeah, where are we?

31:23.206 --> 31:25.607
The heart of the Library.

31:25.608 --> 31:28.444
The Tree of Knowledge should be...

31:28.445 --> 31:32.581
Got any knowledge about which
particular tree it might be?

31:32.582 --> 31:35.484
I do not.

31:35.485 --> 31:37.686
Ingenious.

31:37.687 --> 31:40.255
One final defense mechanism.

31:40.256 --> 31:42.991
Hide a single tree amidst a thousand.

31:42.992 --> 31:45.527
Ingenious, yes, but no defense from us.

31:45.528 --> 31:50.299
[Click] Now take us to
it, my little sprite.

31:52.702 --> 31:54.203
Is it this one?

31:54.204 --> 31:56.004
That is the Tree of Sorrow.

31:56.005 --> 31:58.107
Ooh-Kay. What about that one?

31:58.108 --> 32:00.442
That is the Tree of
Righteous Indignation.

32:00.443 --> 32:02.711
All right, how about this one?

32:02.712 --> 32:06.115
That is Abstract Creativity...
Eve, I'll know it when I see it.

32:06.116 --> 32:07.449
I just haven't seen it yet.

32:07.450 --> 32:09.518
You see, this whole forest is designed

32:09.519 --> 32:11.386
to protect the Tree of Knowledge.

32:11.387 --> 32:12.654
We don't want it to be easy.

32:12.655 --> 32:14.196
Okay, but we want it to be easy for us

32:14.197 --> 32:16.004
because the bad guys have
a glowy little sprite

32:16.005 --> 32:17.292
that's gonna lead them right to it.

32:17.293 --> 32:18.727
We're racing for a needle in a haystack,

32:18.728 --> 32:20.195
and they've got a magnet.

32:20.196 --> 32:21.497
Well, what do you want
me to do about it?

32:21.498 --> 32:24.767
I want you to stop and think.

32:24.768 --> 32:27.202
God, this is always the way with you.

32:27.203 --> 32:29.404
Yeah, this <i> is</i> always the way with me.

32:29.405 --> 32:31.373
For 11 years, longer than
any other Librarian,

32:31.374 --> 32:33.275
it's been <i> my</i> way.

32:33.276 --> 32:35.043
You don't mess with what's working.

32:35.044 --> 32:37.746
But it isn't working, not for me.

32:37.747 --> 32:42.017
I'm sorry. My people
skills are a little rusty.

32:42.018 --> 32:44.219
Are you talking about <i> this</i>

32:44.220 --> 32:45.621
or are you talking about <i> this?</i>

32:45.622 --> 32:47.089
Because if you're talking about this,

32:47.090 --> 32:48.724
maybe now not the best time.

32:48.725 --> 32:50.425
I'm talking about all of this.

32:50.426 --> 32:52.394
I can't live or... or work
by the seat of my pants.

32:52.395 --> 32:56.265
You can't always win by
the seat of your pants.

32:56.266 --> 32:58.033
Well, I haven't lost yet.

32:58.034 --> 33:00.602
Everyone can say that until they can't.

33:00.603 --> 33:03.772
11 years is beginner's luck for Prospero.

33:03.773 --> 33:07.476
He's had 500 years to
plan whatever he's up to.

33:07.477 --> 33:09.411
You think you're gonna defeat
that with a 5-minute plan?

33:09.412 --> 33:11.146
Well, 5-minute plan
is better than nothing.

33:11.147 --> 33:12.481
We're either together or we're not.

33:12.482 --> 33:14.416
We're either a team or we're not.

33:14.417 --> 33:17.797
- It can't be just your way anymore.
- [Footsteps approach]

33:19.055 --> 33:20.822
Never mind. Now there's no time.

33:27.297 --> 33:29.364
[Whispers] Remember when I
said I'd know it when I see it?

33:29.365 --> 33:30.732
- Yeah.
- I see it.

33:30.733 --> 33:33.302
- What?
- And I have a "plan."

33:33.303 --> 33:35.170
- A plan?
- Yeah.

33:35.171 --> 33:38.173
We must be quite near the tree.

33:38.174 --> 33:41.276
Upon its roots, unless
my eyes deceive me.

33:41.277 --> 33:42.744
How do you know that?

33:42.745 --> 33:45.848
The Librarian.

33:45.849 --> 33:47.616
And Guardian.

33:47.617 --> 33:48.893
Duchess!

33:48.894 --> 33:51.364
Pursue her, quick, before
she runs from view.

33:51.371 --> 33:56.274
Whilst I pursue a reckoning overdue.

33:56.275 --> 33:58.443
Oh! Oh!

33:58.444 --> 34:00.479
[Singsongy] Ah, ah, ah.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.147
[Sighs]

34:02.148 --> 34:04.883
Well done, Duchess.
I admire your initiative.

34:04.884 --> 34:08.652
Well, then you're gonna
love my gumption and spunk.

34:08.654 --> 34:12.424
Sadly, I'm afraid they
outshine your tactical sense.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.426
I'm fictional, immortal.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.628
Drop the watch, and I'll
simply dive after it.

34:16.629 --> 34:18.362
Really? You? Diving off a cliff?

34:18.364 --> 34:19.731
If I remember your book,

34:19.732 --> 34:21.733
that didn't work out so
well for you last time.

34:21.734 --> 34:25.437
I know how your story ends.

34:25.438 --> 34:28.739
It's over, Prospero.
You know I can't let you win.

34:28.741 --> 34:32.210
Win or lose, the ending is not certain

34:32.210 --> 34:34.780
while pen is still on
page and ink still wet.

34:34.781 --> 34:38.150
Rhyming couplets?
[Laughs] I expected more.

34:38.150 --> 34:41.253
An ending once was thrust upon my life

34:41.254 --> 34:44.456
by force of will, of Shakespeare.

34:44.456 --> 34:46.792
Not my own.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.527
He wrote me to renounce my power's might,

34:49.529 --> 34:52.563
a choice that, but for
him, I'd not have known.

34:52.565 --> 34:55.434
Soliloquy. That's more
what I was expecting.

34:55.435 --> 34:57.569
Hopefully, it won't turn into
a full sonnet. [Chuckles]

34:57.570 --> 35:01.306
But now with book and
staff my power restored,

35:01.307 --> 35:04.309
I will reclaim the ending I was due,

35:04.310 --> 35:07.813
a happy end for me and all the world.

35:07.814 --> 35:13.285
With magic, I <i> shall
</i> make these ends ensue.

35:13.286 --> 35:15.887
Not without a staff. Not without Ariel.

35:15.888 --> 35:17.622
I mean, look around you.

35:17.623 --> 35:21.426
There are literally thousands of choices.

35:21.427 --> 35:23.628
You will never find
the Tree of Knowledge.

35:23.629 --> 35:25.864
- No?
- No.

35:28.201 --> 35:29.568
Damn.

35:29.569 --> 35:33.572
The Tree of Knowledge so revealed to me.

35:35.508 --> 35:38.210
Come now, Duchess. Be reasonable.

35:38.211 --> 35:39.778
If you read my book,

35:39.779 --> 35:42.636
you know my defeat comes at
the cost of Holmes' own life.

35:42.637 --> 35:43.576
He came back.

35:43.577 --> 35:45.650
Ten years later and he
was never the same.

35:45.651 --> 35:48.686
He was so changed, in fact,
that some scholars believe

35:48.687 --> 35:51.389
it was never truly him
but me in a masquerade.

35:51.390 --> 35:53.224
Are you prepared to take that chance?

35:53.225 --> 35:55.526
Ah, oh.

35:55.527 --> 35:57.595
[Sighs]

35:57.596 --> 35:59.363
Gumption and spunk, indeed.

35:59.364 --> 36:02.700
Very well, I offer you this treaty.

36:02.701 --> 36:04.602
Return the watch to me
and I give you my word,

36:04.603 --> 36:06.003
I shall quit this field of battle.

36:06.004 --> 36:08.573
You're Moriarty. Why
should I trust your word?

36:08.574 --> 36:11.809
If you won't trust my word,
Duchess, trust my self-interest.

36:11.810 --> 36:14.645
I dare not return to
Prospero without Ariel.

36:14.646 --> 36:17.381
His wrath would be
fearsome, even for me.

36:17.382 --> 36:20.585
He holds my book and can
destroy me if he so wishes.

36:20.586 --> 36:23.054
Give me the watch, and I
can return to him freely.

36:23.055 --> 36:25.623
Deny it to me, and I'll
have to fight you for it.

36:25.624 --> 36:27.692
And I cannot predict with any certainty

36:27.693 --> 36:29.660
which of us will walk away from that.

36:29.661 --> 36:33.564
A truce serves me better and you.

36:33.565 --> 36:34.965
Q.E.D.

36:44.610 --> 36:46.677
Until next time, Duchess.

36:48.614 --> 36:51.415
Prospero, don't do this, please.
There has to be another way...

36:51.416 --> 36:53.951
[Whoosh]
[Groans]

36:53.952 --> 36:57.355
And now with staff in hand, I am...

36:57.356 --> 37:00.658
- [Whoosh]
- [Voice distorts] Reborn!

37:04.796 --> 37:06.897
No, no, no, no, no!

37:06.898 --> 37:09.667
No!

37:09.668 --> 37:12.903
What hast thou done?!

37:12.904 --> 37:14.538
You destroyed the Tree of Knowledge

37:14.539 --> 37:16.407
just to stop me?

37:16.408 --> 37:19.310
What kind of Librarian art thou?!

37:19.311 --> 37:21.712
The kind who knows that
sometimes you have to

37:21.713 --> 37:23.314
turn your back on power.

37:23.315 --> 37:25.816
This ending does not
fill the story's page,

37:25.817 --> 37:28.319
but only marks a chapter on the stage.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.621
I will find another object

37:30.622 --> 37:35.426
with which to wield my rage!

37:37.929 --> 37:42.633
[Exhaling deeply]

37:49.605 --> 37:51.873
[Exhales sharply] You burned it?

37:51.874 --> 37:54.476
Yeah.

37:54.477 --> 37:56.611
To keep Prospero from it.

37:56.612 --> 37:58.713
Yeah.

37:58.714 --> 38:00.582
[Exhales deeply]

38:00.583 --> 38:03.318
Tree of Knowledge...

38:03.319 --> 38:05.520
gone.

38:05.521 --> 38:07.722
What?

38:07.723 --> 38:09.624
Don't be crazy. That's not
the Tree of Knowledge.

38:09.625 --> 38:11.092
<i>That's</i> the Tree of Knowledge.

38:12.662 --> 38:15.664
See, knowledge isn't old
or gnarled or knotted.

38:15.665 --> 38:16.965
- [Gasps]
- It's young, always growing.

38:16.966 --> 38:18.600
That's the thing about knowledge.

38:18.601 --> 38:20.535
No matter how much you think you have,

38:20.536 --> 38:22.003
there's always room to grow.

38:22.004 --> 38:25.840
You made Prospero think
the tree was destroyed so...

38:25.841 --> 38:27.542
So that he'd give up.

38:27.543 --> 38:31.079
- Defeated a Fictional with fiction.
- [Sighs heavily]

38:32.715 --> 38:35.850
Good plan, Librarian.

38:38.087 --> 38:40.088
Just don't remember what that tree was.

38:40.089 --> 38:42.424
- [Clears throat]
- I think it was important.

38:42.425 --> 38:43.825
Yeah, it looks important.

38:43.826 --> 38:45.093
Let's not tell Jenkins.

38:45.094 --> 38:48.430
We won't. Secret's safe with me.

38:48.431 --> 38:51.666
[Whoosh]

38:51.667 --> 38:54.135
So I took the liberty of
locking down the Reading Room.

38:54.136 --> 38:56.104
No Fictional will get in that way again.

38:56.105 --> 38:58.106
You trapped the Queen of
Hearts back in her book,

38:58.107 --> 39:00.675
and Frankenstein's Monster,
per your agreement,

39:00.676 --> 39:01.976
is out in the world.

39:01.977 --> 39:03.645
We'll see how that turns out.

39:03.646 --> 39:05.647
Well, I'd love to say
all's well that ends well,

39:05.648 --> 39:07.882
- but this is hardly ended.
- Nor has it ended well.

39:07.883 --> 39:09.617
The Library is still malfunctioning.

39:09.618 --> 39:11.720
Do you know the room that
we could never find a key for?

39:11.721 --> 39:14.189
- Yes. What is in there?
- It is popping up in every corridor.

39:14.190 --> 39:16.691
And, of course, there's still
the missing artifacts.

39:16.692 --> 39:19.127
And then there's that mystery
note from some past Librarian.

39:19.128 --> 39:21.629
Are we sure the staff isn't
already here in the Library?

39:21.630 --> 39:23.465
Maybe it's one of the missing artifacts.

39:23.466 --> 39:25.600
I've checked all the annals,
the appointment book.

39:25.601 --> 39:28.002
There's no evidence whatsoever
that any Librarian anywhere

39:28.003 --> 39:30.038
has ever recovered pieces
of Prospero's staff,

39:30.039 --> 39:31.573
or that they wrote that note.

39:31.574 --> 39:33.508
A mystery to remain unsolved, for now.

39:33.509 --> 39:36.144
Our priorities are clear.
We're going after the artifacts.

39:36.145 --> 39:37.612
Our priority is the Library.

39:37.613 --> 39:39.247
It's broken. The defenses are down.

39:39.248 --> 39:41.015
We need to tend to the homefront.

39:41.016 --> 39:43.485
Did you see that list?
There's, like, 16 things on it.

39:43.486 --> 39:45.520
And those are just the
ones that we know about.

39:45.521 --> 39:46.988
They're out there. They're dangerous.

39:46.989 --> 39:48.723
Prospero looked me in the eye and said,

39:48.724 --> 39:50.253
"I'm going after more powerful objects."

39:50.254 --> 39:51.297
We go after the artifacts.

39:51.298 --> 39:53.040
Without a safe Library to put them in,

39:53.041 --> 39:54.388
what's the point in finding them?

39:54.389 --> 39:57.623
Without the artifacts, what's
the point of a Library?

39:59.594 --> 40:01.295
Well, I'm... I'm... Excuse me.

40:01.296 --> 40:02.629
I'm gonna go take care of

40:02.630 --> 40:04.798
my desperately not wanting to be here.

40:04.799 --> 40:06.192
Jenkins, get my adventure bag.

40:06.193 --> 40:07.815
- I'm going after the Golden Camel of Marrakesh.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:07.816 --> 40:10.204
Stay... stay with us. Let us
plan for what's coming together.

40:10.205 --> 40:11.732
If I stand still, then I go into my head.

40:11.733 --> 40:12.964
And if I go to my head, I get lost.

40:12.965 --> 40:14.827
Then let us help you find your way.

40:14.828 --> 40:15.783
I know my way.

40:15.784 --> 40:17.952
11 years, I've been
going my way. Too long.

40:17.953 --> 40:19.353
This is better, I think.

40:19.354 --> 40:21.840
You stay, you get ready for Prospero.

40:21.841 --> 40:25.310
I go, find the artifacts,
clean up this mess.

40:25.311 --> 40:26.912
Cover more ground.

40:26.913 --> 40:28.380
Sure.

40:28.381 --> 40:32.150
I'll, um... see you around, Eve.

40:32.151 --> 40:34.119
Goodbye, Flynn.

40:38.224 --> 40:40.259
[Whispers] Make sure she
takes care of herself.

40:40.260 --> 40:42.928
What makes you think I have any
control over what she does, sir?

40:42.929 --> 40:45.964
But I'll do my best. Good luck.

40:53.907 --> 40:55.240
Where's Flynn?

40:55.241 --> 40:57.009
He left.

40:57.010 --> 40:58.844
Again?

40:58.845 --> 41:02.748
I mean, shocking. Uh, I'm shocked.

41:02.749 --> 41:04.816
So the Library's security system

41:04.817 --> 41:07.019
could do with a bit of an overhaul.

41:07.020 --> 41:09.121
Thank you.

41:09.122 --> 41:11.650
And someone should
probably do an inventory

41:11.651 --> 41:12.691
of the entire Library.

41:12.692 --> 41:15.794
I mean, just to make sure that
no other artifacts are missing.

41:15.795 --> 41:18.997
It's not like the Clippings Book
is gonna take a vacation

41:18.998 --> 41:20.399
while we do it, so...

41:20.400 --> 41:23.936
So what do you say, Colonel?

41:23.937 --> 41:25.837
Would you mind a little company?

41:25.838 --> 41:29.207
Sounds like a plan.
