was talking about wanting
to go back to living with him.

15:52.255 --> 15:54.823
It's insane; Charlie already
went back to living with me.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.172
-We're not in myhead.
-Oh, yeah?

15:56.216 --> 15:58.609
-Nah. Uh-uh.
-Then why are your legs so long?

15:58.653 --> 16:02.004
My legs have always been long.
It's a burden being tall.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.788
Ah, bullshit, Frank.
We're in your head.

16:03.832 --> 16:05.442
Get us out of there.
Come on, man.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.053
-Ah...
-Ah, yeah.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.098
Oh, you couldn't let me
have that memory?

16:09.142 --> 16:11.448
No, Frank, because it wasn't
a memory, it was a fantasy.

16:11.492 --> 16:13.189
I liked the two me's. That was
a really cool angle, though.

16:13.233 --> 16:14.408
-That was good.
-Yeah, okay, fine, but th...

16:14.451 --> 16:16.410
Can we not go there, please?

16:16.453 --> 16:18.020
All right? For Christ's sakes,
we can't even just sit around

16:18.064 --> 16:19.891
having memories without things
getting out of hand.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.676
Well, at least we're not being
lazy, right? We're coming up

16:21.719 --> 16:24.418
-with new stuff.
-Yeah, all right,
all right, okay,

16:24.461 --> 16:26.115
let's stop, okay?
We-we had our fun,

16:26.159 --> 16:27.160
now we're back to reality,
a-and let's just,

16:27.203 --> 16:28.857
I'd like to keep it
that way, so...

16:28.900 --> 16:31.294
-Yeah, software update's
almost done anyway.
-Oh, nice.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.079
Okay, good, well... Wait.

16:33.122 --> 16:34.863
-Dee.
-What?

16:34.906 --> 16:37.039
Where's your cut?

16:37.083 --> 16:39.128
What cut?

16:39.172 --> 16:42.088
The giant, gaping cut that
was-was just on your forehead.

16:42.131 --> 16:44.873
-Where is it?
-Oh. I don't... I don't know.

16:44.916 --> 16:47.093
Is she changing reality?

16:47.136 --> 16:48.659
I don't know. I don't know
what it means, okay?

16:48.703 --> 16:50.052
But I do know
that we're not back

16:50.096 --> 16:51.880
in the real reality,
and that's not good.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.882
Wait a second. Are we not?
Like, are you sure

16:53.925 --> 16:55.231
she actually fell,
that that actually happened?

16:55.275 --> 16:56.667
I don't know.
I don't know. I mean,

16:56.711 --> 16:58.191
this is so disorienting.
I don't know.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.236
-Dee, snap us back.
-I can't. I'm trying.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.065
All right, all right, wha-what
if it's not thatmuch different?

17:03.109 --> 17:04.893
You know?
Like, what if this reality,

17:04.936 --> 17:07.200
the only difference is that Dee
doesn't have a cut on her head?

17:07.243 --> 17:09.463
-Is that that big of a deal?
-Yes, it's a big deal.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.334
You're talking
about never knowing

17:11.378 --> 17:12.727
which reality you're living in.

17:12.770 --> 17:15.251
Okay, you know what? We need to,
we need to orient ourselves.

17:15.295 --> 17:16.948
Um... Frank.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.124
-Yeah?
-Are you tall and handsome

17:18.167 --> 17:19.255
with a full head of hair?

17:19.299 --> 17:21.083
I like to think so, but no.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.345
No. Good.
Okay, so, Charlie,

17:22.389 --> 17:23.738
is the waitress
in love with you?

17:23.781 --> 17:26.088
Aw, I had her
for a minute, but no.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.264
Great. Uh, Dee,
are you a successful actress?

17:28.308 --> 17:29.744
Oh, I could have been.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.354
Dee, be serious! Yes or no?

17:31.398 --> 17:32.094
-No.
-Yeah.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.488
Mac, um, are you my roommate?

17:34.531 --> 17:36.142
-No, of course not.
-Oh!

17:36.185 --> 17:37.969
-Okay, well, so there it is.
-There we go.

17:38.013 --> 17:40.450
-All right, Mac,
it's clearly you...
-Oh.

17:40.494 --> 17:42.148
...so snap us out of it, man.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.497
No. W-We're not in my head.
I swear.

17:43.540 --> 17:45.499
Yes, we are, man.
We're in your head.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.153
You're trying to alter reality.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.676
Dude, if we were in my head,

17:48.719 --> 17:51.244
why would I not want you
to be my roommate?

17:51.287 --> 17:53.376
But...

17:53.420 --> 17:55.117
-Ah...
-Oh, I get it.
-Wait a minute.

17:55.161 --> 17:58.294
Dennis, we're in your head,
aren't we?

17:58.338 --> 18:01.384
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-No. Why would we be in my head?

18:01.428 --> 18:04.518
Dennis, everyone knows
that the most annoying person

18:04.561 --> 18:07.303
-in the world is Mac.
-Huh?

18:07.347 --> 18:09.305
So why would you ever want
to live with him?

18:09.349 --> 18:12.003
No, that's not-- I--
No, he's great as a roommate.

18:12.047 --> 18:13.570
-Is he great?
-Yeah, he's great.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.746
Name one way.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.574
Yeah, easy. He, um...

18:23.363 --> 18:26.931
-Oh, your head, yeah! So yeah.
-Okay, fine, damn it,

18:26.975 --> 18:28.542
I was trying to, yeah,
get rid of him.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.152
So you don't like living
with me, Dennis?

18:30.196 --> 18:32.241
Oh, no, I... [scoffs]
no, I love having a roommate

18:32.285 --> 18:34.243
who spends three hours a day
on a dildo bike.

18:34.287 --> 18:35.984
Guys, see, this is, this is
why I didn't want to do this.

18:36.027 --> 18:37.768
You know?
No good can come of it.

18:37.812 --> 18:40.206
-It doesn't feel good.
-It has been kind of messy,

18:40.249 --> 18:42.425
like, you know,
it's been confusing, for sure.

18:42.469 --> 18:45.036
So let's just... we just...
so now we just got to make sure

18:45.080 --> 18:47.343
-we're-we're back in reality.
-Yeah, but how do you ever know

18:47.387 --> 18:49.563
-if you're in reality?
-You know what?

18:49.606 --> 18:52.305
I think I got a top here
under the bar. Yeah, I do. I do.

18:52.348 --> 18:54.350
-A top under the bar?
-Top? What do you do with a top?
-So?

18:54.394 --> 18:56.831
Well, a top. Didn't you guys
see the movie Inception?

18:56.874 --> 18:59.181
You know, they spin the top,
and see, the thing is,

18:59.225 --> 19:02.358
if we aren't in reality, then
the top will just spin forever.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.055
But if it wobbles and falls,

19:04.099 --> 19:05.579
then you know
you're back in reality.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.972
-Should we give it a spin?
-Yeah, let's do it.
-Sure.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.018
Let's see.

19:10.061 --> 19:12.020
Seems like that's gonna go
for a while, though.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.761
It does,
it seems like it's gonna...

19:13.804 --> 19:16.285
-Gave it a hell of a spin there.
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

19:16.329 --> 19:18.331
Well, it's a good,
it's a quality top.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.854

-Oh.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.856
-Oh, our phones are updated.
-Oh, for real?

19:21.899 --> 19:23.771
-Oh!
-There we go!
-Oh, sweet!

19:23.814 --> 19:27.035
-Ah...
-Finally.
-Um...

19:27.078 --> 19:29.211
Thank God we're back to normal.
