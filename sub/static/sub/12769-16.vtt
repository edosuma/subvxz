OH, COME ON, NAOMI.
WE WERE GOOD TOGETHER.

02:11.792 --> 02:13.750
I MISSED YOU.
LAST TIME I SAW YOU,

02:13.792 --> 02:17.041
YOU YELLED AT ME
AND YOU JUST ROLLED OFF.
ROLLED? REALLY, NAI?

02:17.083 --> 02:19.000

02:19.041 --> 02:22.458

OH, HEY.
IT'S ONLY BEEN
A FEW DAYS, COOP, BUT...

02:37.250 --> 02:39.041
IT SEEMED LONGER?

02:39.083 --> 02:42.750
YEAH. I-I HIT A WALL
WITH THE CAPTAIN AND ARCHER.

02:42.792 --> 02:45.834
OH, WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.
OOH, I CAN SEE THAT.

02:45.875 --> 02:48.500
I-I KNOW IT WASN'T EASY
FOR YOU GUYS, EITHER,

02:48.542 --> 02:50.417
BUT SO YOU KNOW, I, UH...

02:50.458 --> 02:52.834
(voice breaks)
I APPRECIATE IT.

02:52.875 --> 02:54.834
HEY, HEY, HEY.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.625
(normal voice) OH, I'M SORRY.
DO YOU WANT--

02:56.667 --> 02:58.959
(laughs) IGNORE THIS. (sniffles)
EVER SINCE BIZZY DIED,

02:59.000 --> 03:00.750
THIS HAS JUST BEEN HAPPENING.

03:00.792 --> 03:03.041
SO I'M FINE. IGNORE ME.
(sniffles)

03:03.083 --> 03:05.625
HEY, YOU ARE NEVER
GONNA GUESS WHO...

03:05.667 --> 03:07.542
ADDISON.
I'M FINE.

03:07.583 --> 03:10.542
I-I'M SORRY. ARE YOU OKAY?
NO, IT'S, UH, TRANSIENT TEARS.

03:10.583 --> 03:13.625
WHO--WHO SHOWED UP?
SPILL.

03:13.667 --> 03:15.834
UM... OKAY. FIFE.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.750
HEY. HOW'S HE DOING?

03:17.792 --> 03:19.583
HE'S EXACTLY THE SAME.

03:19.625 --> 03:22.333
(mouth full) SNARKY,
AGGRESSIVE, SELF-INVOLVED?

03:22.375 --> 03:25.041
(laughs) PRETTY MUCH.
OH, HE'S NOT THAT BAD.

03:25.083 --> 03:29.208
YEAH, I DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW MUCH I MISSED HIM.
WELL, HE CERTAINLY CAUGHT YOU
IN THE RIGHT MOOD.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.750
SORRY. THE BITCHINESS,
IT COMES WITH THE TEARS.

03:31.792 --> 03:33.542
I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

03:33.583 --> 03:36.125
ADDISON, IF YOU--IF YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT ARCHER, I--

03:36.166 --> 03:38.125
NO, I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT FIFE.

03:38.166 --> 03:41.041
SO DID IT STIR UP
SOME OLD FEELINGS FOR YOU?

03:41.083 --> 03:44.291
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S, YOU KNOW,
TOO EARLY TO TELL.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.041
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE.

03:46.083 --> 03:48.375
HEY, LADY.
WELCOME BACK.

03:48.417 --> 03:51.041
MM. THANK YOU.
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO CALL YOU.

03:51.083 --> 03:54.041
I HAVE A PATIENT WHO CAME
TO THE HOSPITAL LOOKING FOR YOU.

03:54.083 --> 03:56.500
FANCY.
THEY WANTED YOU, TOO.

03:56.542 --> 03:58.041
WHAT'S THE ISSUE?

03:58.083 --> 04:00.041
(Charlotte)
FRANK AND ISOBELLE'S BABY HAS

04:00.083 --> 04:02.041
HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME.

04:02.083 --> 04:04.250
DR. MONTGOMERY,
YOUR IN UTERO SURGERIES

04:04.291 --> 04:06.375
HAVE BEEN WELL-PUBLICIZED.

04:06.417 --> 04:09.041
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, DUE TO
THE SEVERITY OF THIS CASE,

04:09.083 --> 04:11.041
YOUR BABY'S HEART
ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH

04:11.083 --> 04:13.375
TO PUMP BLOOD THROUGH HER BODY,
SO NO SURGERY--

04:13.417 --> 04:16.125
IN UTERO OR OTHERWISE--
WILL HELP.

04:16.166 --> 04:19.208
AND WE UNDERSTAND, SHE'LL DIE
WITHIN A DAY OF HER BIRTH.

04:19.250 --> 04:21.875
WE WON'T GET TO BE PARENTS
TO HER,

04:21.917 --> 04:25.667
BUT THERE IS A WAY THAT WE CAN
KEEP MORE THAN JUST HER MEMORY.

04:25.709 --> 04:28.625
WE'VE DONE I.V.F. THREE TIMES.
MISCARRIED TWICE.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.250
SHE WAS OUR LAST EMBRYO,

04:31.291 --> 04:34.041
AND I HAVE
NO MORE EGGS LEFT.

04:34.083 --> 04:37.542
BUT OUR BABY,
SHE HAS HUNDREDS ALREADY.

04:37.583 --> 04:41.208
BUT EGGS DON'T MATURE
UNTIL ADOLESCENCE.

04:41.250 --> 04:43.834
ACTUALLY, WE'VE DONE
QUITE A BIT OF RESEARCH,

04:43.875 --> 04:46.625
AND, UM, IF AN OVARY
IS TREATED WITH HORMONES,

04:46.667 --> 04:49.083
IT CAN SPEED UP
THE MATURATION PROCESS.

04:50.542 --> 04:53.125
I'M SORRY. I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

04:53.166 --> 04:56.375
WE'RE ASKING YOU
TO REMOVE OUR BABY'S OVARY

04:56.417 --> 04:59.000
AND FERTILIZE HER EGGS
WITH DONOR SPERM.

05:01.917 --> 05:04.959
I WANT ANOTHER CHANCE
AT MOTHERHOOD.

05:13.542 --> 05:15.500
HMM.
(Violet) HOT?

05:15.542 --> 05:18.500
WHEW.
DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE TOO HOT?

05:18.542 --> 05:21.041
OH, HOW COULD YOU BE
TOO HOT?

05:21.083 --> 05:23.709
MY PUBLISHER SAID THE JACKET
PHOTO IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

05:23.750 --> 05:26.083
PEOPLE SEE THE AUTHOR,
AND IT GIVES THEM A SENSE

05:26.125 --> 05:28.083
OF WHAT THEY'RE GONNA GET
IF THEY BUY THE BOOK.

05:28.125 --> 05:30.083
WELL, I'D BUY PRETTY MUCH
ANYTHING FROM THIS WOMAN.

05:30.125 --> 05:32.083
(laughs) I'M SERIOUS.
SO AM I.

05:32.125 --> 05:34.542
HEY, TONIGHT, UM, MAYBE
YOU COULD WEAR THIS DRESS?

05:34.583 --> 05:36.542
(laughs) OH, MY GOD.

05:36.583 --> 05:39.542
AND I COULD PRETEND THAT I WAS
A FAN AT THE BOOK SIGNING

05:39.583 --> 05:41.917
AND THE BOOKSTORE WAS CLOSING.
HMM?

05:41.959 --> 05:44.500
OKAY... FIRST OF ALL,
THAT'S NOT MY DRESS.

05:44.542 --> 05:47.500
WHAT?
SECOND OF ALL, IT WOULD TAKE
A STYLIST AND AN HOUR

05:47.542 --> 05:50.291
TO GET MY HAIR
TO LOOK THAT WAY AGAIN.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.542
OH. MM.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.959
THESE DON'T EVEN
LOOK LIKE ME.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
THEY GOT YOU ALL WORKED UP.

05:56.041 --> 05:58.667
MM-HMM.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK YOU LIKE
THE FAKE, GLAMMED-UP ME

05:58.709 --> 06:01.041
BETTER THAN THE REAL THING.
OH, COME ON, VIOLET.
STOP IT.

06:01.083 --> 06:03.041
YOU KNOW WHAT? THESE--
THESE ARE NO GOOD.

06:03.083 --> 06:05.583
AND YOU'RE NO GOOD.
GET OUT. GET OUT.
I'M--I-I--YOU GOT--

06:05.625 --> 06:08.375
NO, I CANNOT POSSIBLY GET IN
TROUBLE FOR THINKING THAT YOU--
YOU KNOW WHAT? GET OUT.
GET OUT.

06:08.417 --> 06:11.625
IF YOU LIKE THEM SO MUCH...
(whispers) TAKE THEM WITH YOU.

06:11.667 --> 06:14.041
OKAY. THANK YOU.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.333
(Cooper) WAIT. WHAT?

06:16.375 --> 06:19.041
THEY WANT TO USE THEIR BABY
AS AN EGG FARM.

06:19.083 --> 06:21.542
SEVERE HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART
SYNDROME IS A DEATH SENTENCE.

06:21.583 --> 06:23.792
WELL, YES. WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE
EVENTUALLY, BUT I DOUBT

06:23.834 --> 06:25.792
THAT MEANS THAT YOU'RE PREPARED
TO DONATE AN ORGAN TODAY.

06:25.834 --> 06:28.041
STOP. YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY
DISCUSSING THIS?

06:28.083 --> 06:30.625
CHARLOTTE, YOU CAN'T LET THAT
HAPPEN AT ST. AMBROSE.
WHY NOT?

06:30.667 --> 06:34.041
LOOK, IF IT'S PUBLICITY
YOU'RE AFTER AND--AND YOU THINK

06:34.083 --> 06:35.583
THIS IS GONNA TRANSLATE
INTO FUNDS,

06:35.625 --> 06:38.083
THEN I CAN HAVE THE FOUNDATION
GIVE THE HOSPITAL MONEY.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.667
WOULD IT ACHIEVE NOTORIETY
FOR THE HOSPITAL? ABSOLUTELY.

06:40.709 --> 06:43.875
WOULD WE BE EFFECTIVELY
PERFORMING A MIRACLE? YES.

06:43.917 --> 06:45.792
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
WE COULD BE ALTERING

06:45.834 --> 06:47.458
ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE
TECHNOLOGY FOREVER.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.041
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO DO IT.
BUT IT IS MORALLY WRONG.

06:50.083 --> 06:53.583
NOT EVERYONE
SHARES YOUR COMPASS.
(Cooper scoffs)

06:53.625 --> 06:56.625
BUT YOU KNOW THAT.
ADDISON, IF THERE'S SOMETHING
PERSONAL THAT YOU WANT--

06:56.667 --> 07:00.000
OKAY, COULD WE JUST STAY
ON TOPIC FOR A SECOND?

07:00.041 --> 07:02.625
YOU ARE GOING
WAY OFF THE RAILS HERE.
COOPER.

07:02.667 --> 07:05.041
IN UTERO SURGERY CAN RUPTURE
THE MOTHER'S UTERUS, RIGHT?

07:05.083 --> 07:07.250
IT COULD.
WHICH SHE WOULD NEED
IF SHE WANTS TO--

07:07.291 --> 07:10.709
CARRY HER BABY'S BABY.
I WAS GONNA SAY HAVE ANOTHER
BABY, BUT, YOU KNOW, YUCK.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.500
WHAT IF WE WAIT
TILL THE BABY'S BORN?
SO THAT A BABY THAT'S GONNA LIVE
MAYBE A DAY

07:13.542 --> 07:16.750
CAN SPEND THAT DAY ENDURING
PAINFUL ABDOMINAL SURGERY?

07:16.792 --> 07:19.709
THE CARDS ARE DEALT.
I'M JUST SUGGESTING

07:19.750 --> 07:22.041
WE CREATE SOMETHING GOOD
OUT OF A NASTY SITUATION.

07:22.083 --> 07:25.083
WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS.
ADDISON, YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS.

07:26.792 --> 07:28.041
HEY, LONG NIGHT?

07:28.083 --> 07:30.041
I WAS OUT
WITH MY FRIEND MICHELLE.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.709
I FINALLY CONVINCED HER

07:31.750 --> 07:33.709
TO TAKE
THE HUNTINGTON'S D.N.A. TEST.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.959
IS SHE SEEING VIOLET
OR SHELDON?
NEITHER.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.041
I TOLD HER TO COME IN,
WE'D JUST DO THE TEST,

07:38.083 --> 07:40.041
FIND OUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

07:40.083 --> 07:42.542
THERE'S A 50% CHANCE SHE'LL FIND
OUT SHE'S GONNA DIE, AMELIA.

07:42.583 --> 07:45.750
SHE NEEDS COUNSELING
BEFORE THAT TEST.
SHE'S STRONG.
SHE'LL BE FINE.

07:45.792 --> 07:47.583
THIS IS WHY DOCTOR'S
SHOULDN'T TREAT THEIR FRIENDS.

07:47.625 --> 07:49.959
I'M DOING THIS
BECAUSE I'M HER FRIEND.

07:52.291 --> 07:54.583
I'M THINKING I WANT TO
CHECK OUT NAPLES.

07:54.625 --> 07:57.458
IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER STAMP
ON MY PASSPORT.

07:57.500 --> 08:00.667
OOH, ITALIAN MEN.
SPICY. WHEN YOU GONNA GO?

08:00.709 --> 08:02.750
IF I'M NEGATIVE,
I'LL GO IN THE FALL.

08:02.792 --> 08:05.709
IF I'M POSITIVE,
IT'S ALL OVER, RIGHT?

08:05.750 --> 08:07.709
NO, IF YOU'RE POSITIVE,

08:07.750 --> 08:10.583
YOU'LL HAVE 10 YEARS, 20,
MAYBE MORE.

08:10.625 --> 08:12.125
I KNOW HOW IT WORKS--

08:12.166 --> 08:14.125
EARLY ONSET, LATE ONSET,
EVERY COMPLICATION.

08:14.166 --> 08:17.125
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF IFs,
BUT ONE THING IS FOR SURE.

08:17.166 --> 08:19.750
FROM THE DAY MY MOTHER WAS
DIAGNOSED, IT WAS A NIGHTMARE

08:19.792 --> 08:22.291
THAT GOT WORSE AND WORSE
UNTIL THE DAY THAT SHE DIED.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.709
AND THAT WAS A RELIEF.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.208
AND I...

08:26.250 --> 08:30.583
I DON'T WANT TO WAIT
FOR THE HORROR SHOW TO START.

08:30.625 --> 08:32.583
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

08:32.625 --> 08:36.000
IF I'M POSITIVE,
I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF.

08:46.083 --> 08:49.000
(groans)

08:49.041 --> 08:50.542
(sighs)

08:50.583 --> 08:52.583
ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW THAT--

08:52.625 --> 08:54.041
I THINK THAT--

08:54.083 --> 08:55.583
OH...

08:55.625 --> 08:57.250
YOU FIRST.

08:57.291 --> 08:58.959
THINGS ARE A LITTLE TENSE...

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
AFTER, UH...

09:01.041 --> 09:05.041
OUR NIGHT ON THE DECK.

09:05.083 --> 09:07.417
IT WAS--IT WAS...

09:07.458 --> 09:08.875
JUST FELT COMFORTABLE...

09:08.917 --> 09:10.041
MM-HMM.

09:10.083 --> 09:13.208
AND, UH, FAMILIAR,
AND WE WERE JUST NOSTALGIC.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.041
AND THAT'S OKAY.

09:15.083 --> 09:17.208
DON'T PATRONIZE ME, NAOMI.
I--

09:17.250 --> 09:19.208
OKAY?
I'M NOT CHASING AFTER YOU.

09:19.250 --> 09:22.041
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
IF YOU THINK IT WAS

09:22.083 --> 09:24.625
SOMETHING MORE
THAN NOSTALGIA.

09:24.667 --> 09:28.375
OR ARE YOU STILL
THINKING ABOUT ARCHER?

09:28.417 --> 09:31.625
UH, NO, SAM. NO.

09:31.667 --> 09:34.625
SO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
THAT YOU DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING

09:34.667 --> 09:39.041
WHEN WE WERE OUT THERE
ALL ALONE...

09:39.083 --> 09:42.083
AREN'T YOU TWO
SUPPOSED TO BE DIVORCED?

09:42.125 --> 09:43.667
GOO-GOO EYES,
HUSHED TONES...

09:43.709 --> 09:46.208
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU,
GABRIEL.
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

09:46.250 --> 09:49.834
NO, I DON'T.
DID SHE TELL YOU ABOUT
THE AFRICAN LILIES?

09:49.875 --> 09:52.041
(inhales sharply)
I THOUGHT THEY WERE IMPACTFUL.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.709
SPEAKING OF WHICH--

09:53.750 --> 09:55.709
SHE'S ALLERGIC. OKAY.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.667
WELL, I'VE GOT PATIENTS.

09:57.709 --> 10:02.917
I'M SURE YOU TWO HAVE A LOT
OF... CATCHING UP TO DO.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.333
HAVE DINNER WITH ME
TONIGHT?

10:06.375 --> 10:08.667
I-I CAN'T.
LUNCH?

10:08.709 --> 10:10.750
NO, I--THERE'S NO TIME.

10:10.792 --> 10:12.750
I WILL SIT HERE AND CONTINUE
TO PROPOSE MEALS,

10:12.792 --> 10:15.041
ESPRESSO, CRUDITéS,

10:15.083 --> 10:17.125
WHATEVER IT TAKES--
UNTIL YOU SAY YES.

10:17.166 --> 10:19.625
(sighs) I'M VERY PATIENT.

10:19.667 --> 10:22.792
I ALREADY TOLD YOU. I LIKE
THAT FIRST SET OF PICTURES.

10:22.834 --> 10:26.709
COME ON, COOPER.
HELP ME. WHICH ONE?
SEE, I KNOW
HOW THIS TURNS OUT.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.709
I SAY,
"THE BLUE ONE LOOKS NICE,"

10:28.750 --> 10:30.875
AND YOU SAY,
"JUST NICE NOT GREAT?"

10:30.917 --> 10:32.875
AND THEN I SAY, "NO. YOU LOOK
GREAT IN EVERYTHING YOU WEAR."

10:32.917 --> 10:34.667
AND THEN YOU SAY,

10:34.709 --> 10:36.667
"YOU DON'T REALLY SOUND LIKE
YOU MEAN THAT." SO I SAY,

10:36.709 --> 10:38.667
"NO, IT'S NOT THAT. I JUST
LIKE THE OTHER ONE BETTER."

10:38.709 --> 10:40.667
AND THEN WE GET TO THE PART
WHERE YOU SAY,

10:40.709 --> 10:42.959
"YOU THINK I LOOK FAT IN THIS,
DON'T YOU?"

10:43.000 --> 10:45.709
AND THEN I'M SLEEPING
ON THE COUCH.
YOU DO REALIZE
THAT I'M NOT CHARLOTTE?

10:45.750 --> 10:48.458
IF YOU ASKED FOR HELP, I WOULD
AT LEAST TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.166
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME.
PLEASE.

10:50.208 --> 10:52.500
OKAY. THE BLUE ONE.

10:52.542 --> 10:54.500
OOH, YOU THINK SO?

10:54.542 --> 10:57.625
HEY, SHELDON.
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

10:57.667 --> 11:00.458
DON'T PICK THE BLUE ONE.

11:01.959 --> 11:03.583
UH...

11:03.625 --> 11:05.917
I'M SLAMMED.

11:05.959 --> 11:08.000
WE JUST NEED A MINUTE.

11:08.041 --> 11:09.709
WE?
(Isobelle) PLEASE.

11:09.750 --> 11:13.000
DR. MONTGOMERY, WE ARE
DESPERATE TO BE A FAMILY.

11:13.041 --> 11:15.291
GIVING BIRTH, UH,
IS NOT THE ONLY WAY.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.625
HAVE YOU TWO
DISCUSSED ADOPTION?

11:17.667 --> 11:20.166
I NEED TO BE A MOTHER
TO A CHILD

11:20.208 --> 11:24.041
THAT CAME FROM INSIDE OF ME,
A CHILD THAT IS A PART OF US.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.041
IT MAY BE IRRATIONAL,
BUT--

11:26.083 --> 11:28.041
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT
TO HAVE A BABY.

11:28.083 --> 11:30.750
FRANK AND I HAVE
BEEN TOGETHER 20 YEARS.

11:30.792 --> 11:32.750
AND AT FIRST, WE WERE YOUNG.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.208
YOU KNOW,
WE WANTED TO DO THINGS,

11:35.250 --> 11:37.667
AND THEN OUR CAREERS--
YOU GET OFF THE FAST TRACK,

11:37.709 --> 11:39.041
YOU LOSE YOUR PLACE.

11:39.083 --> 11:41.041
FINALLY, WE WERE READY,
AND AFTER SPENDING

11:41.083 --> 11:43.041
EVERY DIME WE HAD ON I.V.F.,

11:43.083 --> 11:46.542
TWO MISCARRIAGES
IN THE SECOND TRIMESTER.

11:46.583 --> 11:49.542
BUT WHEN THIS BABY
FINALLY MADE IT TO 24 WEEKS,

11:49.583 --> 11:51.208
WE--WE THOUGHT...

11:51.250 --> 11:53.542
WE--WE THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE OKAY.

11:53.583 --> 11:55.667
BUT IT'S NOT,

11:55.709 --> 12:00.417
BECAUSE OUR BABY WILL BE LUCKY
TO GET A FULL DAY OF LIFE.

12:00.458 --> 12:03.583
SO EITHER GOD REALLY HATES US,

12:03.625 --> 12:05.792
OR SHE MADE IT THIS FAR
FOR A REASON.

12:05.834 --> 12:09.041
YOU KNOW, WOMEN THINK
THAT THEY CAN HAVE IT ALL.

12:09.083 --> 12:12.041
THEY CAN JUST WAIT AND DECIDE
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,

12:12.083 --> 12:15.083
BUT WE'RE WRONG.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.709
OKAY.

12:16.750 --> 12:20.667
YOU'LL DO IT?
I CAN'T GUARANTEE
THAT IT'LL WORK.

12:20.709 --> 12:22.458
IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.625
AND I WON'T RISK YOUR LIFE
OR RISK PERFORATING YOUR UTERUS,

12:25.667 --> 12:29.041
SO I WILL DO THE SURGERY,
BUT AFTER YOUR BABY'S BORN,

12:29.083 --> 12:31.750
NOT BEFORE.
THANK YOU.

12:34.625 --> 12:37.625
(indistinct conversations)

12:39.375 --> 12:41.000
YOU OKAY?

12:43.333 --> 12:46.333
MICHELLE'S TEST RESULTS.

12:46.375 --> 12:49.125
I'M SORRY.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.125
I PUSHED HER...

12:51.166 --> 12:53.083
TO FIND OUT, AND NOW...

12:53.125 --> 12:54.625
(sighs)

12:54.667 --> 12:56.291
SHE'S GONNA KILL HERSELF,
PETE.

12:56.333 --> 12:58.542
SHE'S GOING TO BE DEVASTATED,
BUT--

12:58.583 --> 13:01.083
NO, SHE HAS ALREADY DECIDED.
PEOPLE SAY THINGS. THEY--

13:01.125 --> 13:02.959
MICHELLE KNOWS
WHAT IS COMING.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.959
SHE SAW WHAT IT DID
TO HER MOTHER.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.083
I MEAN, SHE HAS SEEN
THE CLUMSINESS,

13:07.125 --> 13:10.041
THEN IT GETS HARD TO SWALLOW,
YOUR MUSCLES GO RIGID,

13:10.083 --> 13:13.667
THE SEIZURES AND DEMENTIA--
I MEAN, I DON'T BLAME HER,

13:13.709 --> 13:15.667
BUT I HAVE
BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE--

13:15.709 --> 13:17.667
LOSING SOMEBODY CLOSE TO ME
WAY TOO SOON.

13:17.709 --> 13:20.500
AND MAYBE IT IS SELFISH--
IT'S NOT SELFISH.
YOU CARE ABOUT HER.

13:20.542 --> 13:23.750
BUT AS GOOD A FRIEND AS YOU ARE,
IT'S NOT ENOUGH ANYMORE.

13:23.792 --> 13:27.375
YOU NEED
TO GET HER SOME HELP. NOW.

13:29.083 --> 13:30.500
(Naomi laughs)

13:30.542 --> 13:33.250
NO, I AM SERIOUS.
WHERE'D YOU GO?

13:33.291 --> 13:35.250
I GOT A GIANT GRANT
FROM THE ONLY PLACE

13:35.291 --> 13:37.166
THAT HAS MORE MONEY
THAN YOU NOW.

13:37.208 --> 13:38.917
THE GOVERNMENT.
OH.

13:38.959 --> 13:40.667
MM-HMM.
IMPRESSIVE.

13:40.709 --> 13:42.667
NO, WHAT'S IMPRESSIVE IS,

13:42.709 --> 13:44.917
I LEFT MY BIG, FANCY OFFICE
AT THE N.I.H.

13:44.959 --> 13:47.709
WITH LOTS OF CUTE
LITTLE DOCTORS FAWNING OVER ME

13:47.750 --> 13:50.041
TO COME BACK AND GET YOU.
TO GET ME?

13:50.083 --> 13:52.834
COME ON, NAOMI.
WE HAVE GREAT CHEMISTRY.

13:52.875 --> 13:56.291
YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH SCIENCE.

13:56.333 --> 13:59.625
I'M... VERY FOND OF YOU.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.542
BUT, UH...

14:01.583 --> 14:03.583
THIS JUST ISN'T
THE RIGHT TIME.

14:03.625 --> 14:06.125
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
I'M COMPETING WITH A DEAD MAN.

14:06.166 --> 14:08.375
WITH WILLIAM? NO.

14:08.417 --> 14:11.000
NO, I JUST...

14:11.041 --> 14:15.625
UM... MY LIFE HAS
CERTAIN COMPLICATIONS RIGHT NOW.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.583
OH.

14:17.625 --> 14:21.583
OH? WHAT "OH"?

14:21.625 --> 14:24.041
(lowered voice)
THAT'S CODE FOR "SAM."
NO.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.458
NO.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.041
NO.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.542
(normal voice) NAOMI, YOU CAN
TALK TO ME, ABOUT ANYTHING,

14:29.583 --> 14:31.750
EVEN SAM.

14:31.792 --> 14:33.750
IF YOU WANT TO WOO ME,

14:33.792 --> 14:37.583
DISCUSSING MY EX-HUSBAND
I-IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.000
OKAY?

14:41.083 --> 14:43.375
(sniffles)

14:43.417 --> 14:47.333
(indistinct conversations)

14:47.375 --> 14:50.625
(sighs)
YOU GONNA DO SOMETHING?

14:50.667 --> 14:52.834
I DON'T KNOW.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.375
WELL, I WANT A BANANA.

14:54.417 --> 14:56.625
YOU KNOW, IT'S CUSTOMARY

14:56.667 --> 15:00.166
FOR THE BOYFRIEND TO OFFER
COMFORT IN THIS SITUATION.

15:00.208 --> 15:04.000
WELL, MY COMFORT
ISN'T ALWAYS... COMFORTING.

15:04.041 --> 15:07.166
WELL, SOMETIMES YOU JUST
HAVE TO PLOW THROUGH IT.

15:07.208 --> 15:09.125
MM.

15:11.959 --> 15:14.834
AND SOMETIMES
YOU JUST NEED TO AVOID.

15:28.792 --> 15:30.041
(sniffles)

15:30.083 --> 15:32.041
(sniffles)

15:32.083 --> 15:34.041
(sniffles)

15:37.458 --> 15:39.208
(sighs)

15:39.250 --> 15:41.333
THANK YOU.

15:41.375 --> 15:42.625
(sniffles)

15:42.667 --> 15:44.417
(blows nose)

15:44.458 --> 15:47.333
(sniffles)

15:47.375 --> 15:49.083
OH, KEEP IT. REALLY.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.417
OH. (chuckles)

15:50.458 --> 15:52.041
OKAY.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.041
YOU KNOW, I'M--I'M OKAY,
YOU KNOW.

15:54.083 --> 15:57.083
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE WERE CLOSE OR ANYTHING.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.542
(sighs)

15:59.583 --> 16:01.709
WELL, SOMETIMES
THAT MAKES IT HARDER

16:01.750 --> 16:04.041
THAN WHEN
THE RELATIONSHIP WAS GOOD

16:04.083 --> 16:06.500
AND THERE WERE
NO UNRESOLVED ISSUES,

16:06.542 --> 16:08.375
NOTHING LEFT UNSAID.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.917
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING'S
EVEN SETTING THIS OFF.

16:10.959 --> 16:13.709
I AM CRYING
BECAUSE WE'RE OUT OF SWEETENER.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.750
I MEAN, IT'S--IT'S LIKE
MY TEAR DUCTS

16:15.792 --> 16:16.750
ARE ACTING ON THEIR OWN.

16:16.792 --> 16:19.667
I JUST...

16:19.709 --> 16:21.875
I JUST WANT IT TO BE OVER.

16:21.917 --> 16:25.583
GRIEF HAS ITS OWN TIMELINE.

16:25.625 --> 16:28.917
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

16:28.959 --> 16:31.917
YOU CAN'T GET OFF
TILL THE RIDE STOPS.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.166
(sighs)

16:48.875 --> 16:51.750
EVEN IN COLLEGE, YOU HAD
A KILLER POKER FACE.

16:51.792 --> 16:53.000
MICHELLE--

16:53.041 --> 16:55.000
YOU KNOW, THE DAY
MY MOTHER WAS DIAGNOSED

16:55.041 --> 16:57.166
WAS THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE,

16:57.208 --> 17:00.041
BUT TODAY--
TODAY COULD ACTUALLY TOP IT.

17:00.083 --> 17:01.709
(exhales deeply)

17:01.750 --> 17:03.750
OKAY.

17:05.417 --> 17:08.000
I'M READY.

17:08.041 --> 17:10.041
YOU'RE NEGATIVE.

17:10.083 --> 17:11.583
WHAT?

17:11.625 --> 17:14.041
(sighs)
YOU DON'T HAVE IT.

17:14.083 --> 17:16.458
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE.

17:16.500 --> 17:19.750
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD! (laughs)

17:19.792 --> 17:20.667
(laughs)

17:20.709 --> 17:23.250
OH, MY GOD.

17:30.709 --> 17:32.750
YOU LIED TO HER
ABOUT THE TEST RESULTS?

17:32.792 --> 17:34.250
PETE, I TOLD YOU.

17:34.291 --> 17:36.542
SHE SAID SHE WOULD KILL HERSELF,
AND SHE WAS SERIOUS.

17:36.583 --> 17:38.792
AND I TOLD YOU THAT WHEN YOU
HAVE A SUICIDAL PATIENT,

17:38.834 --> 17:42.041
YOU REFER THEM TO A THERAPIST.
YOU DON'T LIE.
NO, YOU DO

17:42.083 --> 17:44.875
WHEN IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST
OF YOUR PATIENT.
YOU'RE LETTING YOUR FRIENDSHIP
GET IN THE WAY

17:44.917 --> 17:47.166
OF YOUR MEDICAL TRAINING.

17:47.208 --> 17:49.083
YOU'RE JUST
TRYING TO JUSTIFY THIS.

17:49.125 --> 17:51.583
YOU WERE RIGHT.
YOU ARE BEING SELFISH.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.583
ONE DAY--MAYBE SOONER,
MAYBE LATER--

17:53.625 --> 17:56.667
BUT ONE DAY SHE IS GONNA DIE
A SHELL OF WHO SHE IS.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.667
BUT RIGHT NOW, MICHELLE IS
HEALTHY AND HAPPY,

17:58.709 --> 18:00.792
AND SHE CAN STAY THAT WAY
FOR TEN YEARS, EVEN MORE.

18:00.834 --> 18:03.041
SO AS HER DOCTOR
AND AS HER FRIEND,

18:03.083 --> 18:06.041
I NEED TO PROTECT HER FROM PAIN
FOR AS LONG AS I CAN,

18:06.083 --> 18:09.041
BECAUSE NEITHER OF US
WANTS TO GIVE UP YET,

18:09.083 --> 18:11.250
NOT WHILE SHE CAN STILL
GO OUT DANCING AND TRAVEL

18:11.291 --> 18:13.291
AND TELL JOKES
THAT ARE SO STUPID

18:13.333 --> 18:16.959
THAT THEY PULL ME OUT OF
THE BLACKEST PLACES I GO.

18:18.750 --> 18:21.709
AS LONG AS THERE IS NO TREATMENT
FOR HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE,

18:21.750 --> 18:23.750
THE BEST MEDICINE
THAT I CAN OFFER HER

18:23.792 --> 18:26.750
IS TO TELL HER THAT
SHE WON'T GET IT AT ALL.

18:26.792 --> 18:29.750
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TELL MICHELLE
WHEN SHE WAKES UP WITH SYMPTOMS?

18:29.792 --> 18:32.542
I'M GONNA ASK...

18:32.583 --> 18:35.875
DID YOU ENJOY
THE TIME YOU HAD?

18:35.917 --> 18:39.458
AND HOPE TO GOD SHE SAYS YES.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.208
HEY. OH, COOKIES.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.041
(mouth full) OH, MY GOD.
THESE ARE GOOD.

18:54.083 --> 18:57.667
THEY'RE CRUNCHY,
BUT THE CHOCOLATE'S STILL SOFT.
I KNOW.

18:57.709 --> 19:00.041
I'M KEEPING 'EM OVER THERE
'CAUSE I ALREADY HAD THREE.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.542
(normal voice) BETTER BE
FROM A GRATEFUL PATIENT

19:02.583 --> 19:05.041
AND NOT SOME SECRET BOYFRIEND.

19:05.083 --> 19:08.792
"WE'RE FOREVER THANKFUL FOR YOUR
HELP. FRANK AND ISOBELLE."

19:10.625 --> 19:12.000
NO.

19:12.041 --> 19:15.041
ADDISON'S GONNA WAIT UNTIL
AFTER THE BABY'S BORN--

19:15.083 --> 19:17.875
THAT'S WORSE, CHARLOTTE!
IT'S A BABY!

19:17.917 --> 19:20.083
WITH A LIFE--

19:20.125 --> 19:22.625
A TRAGICALLY SHORT ONE,
BUT THAT IS A LIFE.

19:22.667 --> 19:25.041
HOW ARE WE NOT
ON THE SAME SIDE HERE?

19:25.083 --> 19:27.041
BECAUSE YOU'RE
IGNORING THE FACT

19:27.083 --> 19:29.625
THAT THIS COULD HELP MAKE
ANOTHER LONGER LIFE.

19:29.667 --> 19:32.166
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'D BE A PART OF THIS.

19:32.208 --> 19:34.750
(thuds)

19:36.959 --> 19:39.166
SO MY PUBLISHER
NEEDED THESE, LIKE, YESTERDAY.

19:39.208 --> 19:41.166
DO ANY OF THESE WORK?

19:41.208 --> 19:42.834
WELL, YOU LOOK GREAT.

19:42.875 --> 19:45.041
REALLY?
MM-HMM.

19:45.083 --> 19:47.625
YOU KIDDING?
YOU LOOK TRUSTWORTHY, SMART.

19:47.667 --> 19:49.625
YES, DEFINITELY.
TRUSTWORTHY AND SMART.

19:49.667 --> 19:52.792
COOPER?
YEAH, THEY'RE GOOD.
WHAT'S WITH THE BOOK?

19:52.834 --> 19:54.625
(Sheldon)
IT'S A PSYCH TEXTBOOK.
I CAN SEE THAT,

19:54.667 --> 19:57.041
BUT HOW OFTEN DO YOU SIT
AT THE EDGE OF YOUR DESK

19:57.083 --> 19:59.458
WITH IT
IN YOUR HAND LIKE THAT?
WELL, THE PHOTOGRAPHER
THOUGHT THIS STAGING

19:59.500 --> 20:01.458
WOULD MAKE ME LOOK
MORE... RESPECTABLE.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.542
WHAT, YOU DON'T LIKE IT?
NO.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.750
IT'S JUST, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE ABOUT

20:05.792 --> 20:08.041
TWO SECONDS AWAY
FROM HURLING IT AT A PATIENT.

20:08.083 --> 20:11.125
WELL, YOU DO LOOK
A BIT INTENSE.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.458
WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY
A BAD THING. IS IT?

20:13.500 --> 20:15.458
I'D BUY A BOOK
WRITTEN BY THIS WOMAN,

20:15.500 --> 20:18.542
IN FACT, I'D EVEN PAY
HARDCOVER PRICE.
(laughs)

20:18.583 --> 20:21.458
BUT IF YOU'RE ASKING...

20:21.500 --> 20:23.458
THIS ISN'T YOU, VIOLET.

20:23.500 --> 20:26.500
YOU'RE NOT SOME UPTIGHT, STODGY
THERAPIST WHO LOOKS LIKE THIS.

20:26.542 --> 20:28.417
YOU'RE OPEN AND WELCOMING.

20:28.458 --> 20:30.917
YOU SIT ON YOUR COUCH
ALL CURLED UP DRINKING TEA,

20:30.959 --> 20:32.917
MAKING PEOPLE
FEEL LIKE THEY KNOW YOU.

20:32.959 --> 20:35.041
I MEAN, THAT'S WHO YOU ARE.
IT'S A GOOD THING.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.875
IT'S--IT'S WHY
YOUR PATIENTS LOVE YOU.

20:37.917 --> 20:40.000
(sighs)

20:41.667 --> 20:44.041
HEY.
HEY.

20:44.083 --> 20:46.041
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
OH, ISOBELLE'S WATER
JUST BROKE.

20:46.083 --> 20:48.166
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY TO
THE HOSPITAL TO CHECK ON HER.

20:48.208 --> 20:51.041
ADDISON, YOU'RE REALLY
GONNA DO THIS?

20:51.083 --> 20:53.792
YOU'RE GONNA HARVEST
THAT BABY'S EGGS?
THAT BABY'S GONNA DIE.

20:53.834 --> 20:55.875
AT LEAST THIS WAY,
ISOBELLE AND FRANK--

20:55.917 --> 20:58.041
NO, NO,
JUST FORGET ABOUT THEM.

20:58.083 --> 21:00.750
THEY ARE BLINDED BY THEIR
DESIRE TO BECOME PARENTS--

21:00.792 --> 21:04.041
A DESIRE WHICH THEY CLEARLY
DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
WHO DOES UNDERSTAND IT?

21:04.083 --> 21:07.041
IT'S SOME
PSYCHO-BIOLOGICAL IMPULSE

21:07.083 --> 21:08.667
THAT'S HARDWIRED INTO US.

21:08.709 --> 21:10.500
WELL, IT'S ALSO
A RESPONSIBILITY.

21:10.542 --> 21:12.500
THAT THEY SEEM
FULLY PREPARED TO ACCEPT.

21:12.542 --> 21:15.750
I MEAN, NAI, WHERE--
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

21:15.792 --> 21:19.125
YOU'VE DEVOTED YOUR WHOLE LIFE
TO HELPING WOMEN

21:19.166 --> 21:21.125
WHO CAN'T CONCEIVE
ON THEIR OWN CONCEIVE.

21:21.166 --> 21:23.417
NO, THIS IS DIFFERENT.
IT'S EXPERIMENTAL.

21:23.458 --> 21:25.041
NO, THIS IS NAZI GERMANY

21:25.083 --> 21:27.500
AND--AND TUSKEGEE
ALL ROLLED INTO ONE.

21:27.542 --> 21:29.500
WE ARE SCIENTISTS
TRYING TO PROGRESS.

21:29.542 --> 21:32.667
THEY WANT A BABY. WE MIGHT
BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM ONE.

21:32.709 --> 21:35.750
BY ALLOWING THEM TO TREAT
THE BABY THAT THEY HAVE NOW

21:35.792 --> 21:37.750
LIKE IT'S ALREADY DEAD?
(elevator bell dings)

21:37.792 --> 21:40.375
ADDISON, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
I WANT TO.

21:40.417 --> 21:42.917
BUT--O-OKAY. FOR WHOM?

21:42.959 --> 21:46.500
ADDISON...
YOU'RE GRIEVING YOUR MOTHER,

21:46.542 --> 21:49.166
AND YOU DESPERATELY
WANT A BABY,

21:49.208 --> 21:51.166
AND IF YOU CAN HELP THEM,
MAYBE IT MEANS

21:51.208 --> 21:54.166
THAT DOWN THE ROAD,
YOU MIGHT GET ONE, TOO.

21:54.208 --> 21:57.792
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT QUESTIONING
MY JUDGMENT.

21:57.834 --> 22:00.000
(clicks button)
MAYBE I AM.

22:00.041 --> 22:02.917
YOU'VE BEEN QUESTIONING MINE.

22:02.959 --> 22:05.792
THERE ARE LINES
THAT WE SHOULDN'T CROSS.

22:05.834 --> 22:08.750
UNLESS OUR TEENAGE DAUGHTER
BECOMES PREGNANT.
(elevator bell dings)

22:08.792 --> 22:11.542
OH, WOW.

22:11.583 --> 22:14.166
WHEN DID I STOP KNOWING YOU?

22:20.625 --> 22:22.542
(knock on door)

22:22.583 --> 22:25.041
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
DO I HAVE A CHOICE?

22:25.083 --> 22:28.250
UM...

22:30.083 --> 22:32.834
I'M--I'M NOT
A ROMANTIC PERSON.

22:32.875 --> 22:35.208
HERE IT COMES.
I'M A--
I'M A PRACTICAL PERSON.

22:35.250 --> 22:37.208
I'M THE PERSON
WHO LOOKS AROUND

22:37.250 --> 22:40.000
AND SEES WHAT NEEDS
TO BE ACCOMPLISHED,

22:40.041 --> 22:41.208
AND THEN GETS IT DONE.

22:41.250 --> 22:43.041
WHEN WILLIAM WAS DYING,
I-I FED HIM,

22:43.083 --> 22:46.375
AND I CLEANED HIM,
AND I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

22:46.417 --> 22:48.333
WHEN MY MARRIAGE TO SAM
WAS OVER,

22:48.375 --> 22:50.625
I WAS THE ONE WHO TOOK CARE
OF ALL THE DETAILS

22:50.667 --> 22:52.750
SO THAT WE COULD BOTH
JUST MOVE ON.

22:52.792 --> 22:55.041
YOU CARRY
A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.000
AND ADDISON--
YOU KNOW, I...

22:57.041 --> 22:59.166
I HAVE LOVED HER
LIKE A SISTER,

22:59.208 --> 23:02.041
AND I HAVE FORGIVEN HER
ALL HER FLAWS

23:02.083 --> 23:03.583
BECAUSE I-I KNOW--

23:03.625 --> 23:06.166
I KNOW THAT SHE IS DOING
THE BEST THAT SHE CAN.

23:06.208 --> 23:09.208
AGAIN, A HEAVY BURDEN.
AND IT FEELS HEAVY. GOD.
(chuckles)

23:09.250 --> 23:10.750
MM.

23:10.792 --> 23:12.750
WHY IS IT THEN

23:12.792 --> 23:15.041
THAT WHEN--WHEN I WAS--
WHEN I WAS TRAVELING THE WORLD

23:15.083 --> 23:17.041
AND--AND DOING ALL OF
THE FOUNDATION BUSINESS

23:17.083 --> 23:19.000
AND SOLVING SERIOUS PROBLEMS,

23:19.041 --> 23:20.291
I-I...

23:20.333 --> 23:22.041
I FELT SO LIGHT?

23:22.083 --> 23:24.041
BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS
YOU WERE SOLVING

23:24.083 --> 23:26.375
WEREN'T YOUR OWN.

23:26.417 --> 23:29.041
YEAH.

23:30.875 --> 23:33.083
FIFE SAYS
HE'S IN LOVE WITH ME.

23:33.125 --> 23:35.083
WELL, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

23:35.125 --> 23:38.875
WELL, YOU KNOW, HE MAKES ME
LAUGH, AND THAT FEELS GOOD.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.291
RECENTLY,
SAM AND I HAD A...

23:42.333 --> 23:44.041
A MOMENT,

23:44.083 --> 23:47.041
AND, UH, I DON'T KNOW.

23:47.083 --> 23:48.625
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT? NO.

23:48.667 --> 23:50.625
I-I DO NOT WANT
TO REVISIT THE PAST.

23:50.667 --> 23:53.542
I JUST--
SO, UH, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

23:53.583 --> 23:56.041
I DON'T KNOW. I WANT SIMPLE.
I-I WANT TO GO

23:56.083 --> 23:58.041
AND BUILD HOSPITALS IN INDIA.

23:58.083 --> 24:01.041
I WANT TO VACCINATE
AFRICAN CHILDREN.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.667
(laughs) IS THAT ALL?

24:02.709 --> 24:05.041
SO GO BUILD AND VACCINATE

24:05.083 --> 24:07.834
AND--AND--AND JUST...

24:07.875 --> 24:10.000
GO.

24:15.083 --> 24:16.667
OW! MM.

24:16.709 --> 24:18.041
IT'S OKAY, ISOBELLE.

24:18.083 --> 24:21.000
IT HURTS. IS IT SUPPOSED
TO HURT THAT MUCH?
UNFORTUNATELY, YES.

24:21.041 --> 24:23.083
(Charlotte) KEEP BREATHING.
TRY TO STAY CALM.

24:23.125 --> 24:26.000
OH, OH, OH.
THE BABY'S CORD
IS PROLAPSED.

24:26.041 --> 24:29.959
THE BABY'S IN DISTRESS.
WE NEED TO DO A C-SECTION.
OH, HELP HER!

24:30.000 --> 24:32.959
PLEASE HELP OUR BABY.
OKAY, OKAY.
YOU'RE OKAY. YOU'RE OKAY.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.834
OH! OW!

24:36.834 --> 24:40.000
...EVERY TIME.
(laughs) I DO N--

24:44.959 --> 24:46.041
WHAT?

24:46.083 --> 24:48.250
AS A RECOVERING ADDICT,

24:48.291 --> 24:51.959
YOU KNOW... HONESTY
IS ALWAYS THE BEST CHOICE.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.542
THIS FROM A MAN
WHO TRIED TO CONVINCE ME

24:54.583 --> 24:58.000
A PATIENT COULD SEE WHEN SHE
WAS ACTUALLY STILL BLIND?

25:06.417 --> 25:10.625
SO PETE TOLD ME ABOUT
YOUR FRIEND. I'M SO SORRY.

25:10.667 --> 25:13.375
THANK YOU.

25:13.417 --> 25:17.542
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE LIED TO HER.

25:17.583 --> 25:21.917
SHE'S LIVING HER LIFE.
I'M HELPING HER.
YOU'RE DECEIVING HER,

25:21.959 --> 25:25.041
AND--AND SHE'S LIVING
SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE.
OF COURSE YOU WOULD
TAKE HIS SIDE.

25:25.083 --> 25:27.041
NO, I'M--I'M TAKING
YOUR FRIEND'S SIDE.

25:27.083 --> 25:30.041
SHE'S--SHE'S GONNA NEED PEOPLE
THAT SHE CAN--THAT SHE CAN TRUST

25:30.083 --> 25:32.834
DOWN THE LINE
WHEN SHE BECOMES SYMPTOMATIC.

25:32.875 --> 25:34.834
I HOPE
SHE CAN STILL TRUST YOU.

25:34.875 --> 25:38.625
IF I TELL HER THE TRUTH,
SHE WILL TAKE HER OWN LIFE.

25:40.834 --> 25:42.792
WELL...

25:42.834 --> 25:45.041
SHOW HER A REASON TO LIVE

25:45.083 --> 25:47.000
AND BRING HER IN HERE

25:47.041 --> 25:50.417
WHERE SHE CAN GET THE THERAPY
SHE REALLY NEEDS.

25:56.250 --> 25:59.041
CAN I HELP YOU?

25:59.083 --> 26:02.667
NAOMI CAN'T MOVE FORWARD
WHILE YOU'RE STILL HOLDING ON.

26:02.709 --> 26:05.083
OR SHE'S JUST NOT
THAT INTO YOU.

26:05.125 --> 26:09.166
YOU HAD HER AND YOU LET HER GO.
THAT WAS YOUR MISTAKE.

26:09.208 --> 26:12.041
NOW YOU NEED TO DO
THE RIGHT THING FOR HER.
YOU MEAN FOR YOU.

26:12.083 --> 26:15.000
I MEAN FOR ALL OF US.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.041
YOU ARE AN ARROGANT BASTARD.

26:17.083 --> 26:20.458
WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK
TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM?

26:20.500 --> 26:23.166
I INTEND TO, WITH NAOMI.

26:23.208 --> 26:26.208
(motor whirring)

26:28.083 --> 26:32.208
IS SHE OKAY?
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT SHE'S...

26:32.250 --> 26:34.250
BUT IS SHE OKAY?

26:34.291 --> 26:37.041
SHE IS RESTING.

26:37.083 --> 26:39.041
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
A NAME?

26:39.083 --> 26:42.083
WHEN CAN YOU DO
THE SURGERY?

26:42.125 --> 26:44.500
W-WOULDN'T YOU LIKE
TO MEET HER FIRST?

26:44.542 --> 26:47.041
JUST REMOVE HER OVARIES.

26:47.083 --> 26:51.083
YOU SAID YOU WOULD DO IT.
WE NEED YOU TO DO IT NOW.

26:54.125 --> 26:57.083
(babies crying)

26:57.125 --> 27:01.041
(indistinct conversations)

27:01.083 --> 27:03.041
(whispers indistinctly)

27:03.083 --> 27:04.917
HEY.

27:04.959 --> 27:06.500
HEY.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.000
YOU CAN'T TELL, YOU KNOW?

27:08.041 --> 27:11.250
SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE
ALL THE OTHER PREEMIES.

27:11.291 --> 27:13.333
I WONDER WHAT SHE WOULD'VE
GROWN UP TO BE.

27:13.375 --> 27:15.041
COOPER, DON'T.
DON'T GO THERE.

27:15.083 --> 27:18.041
HOW CAN YOU NOT?

27:18.083 --> 27:19.750
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:19.792 --> 27:21.917
I HAVE TO TAKE HER NOW.

27:21.959 --> 27:24.917
(whispers) OKAY.

27:24.959 --> 27:26.917
HERE WE GO.

27:26.959 --> 27:29.000
(normal voice)
WHERE ARE THE PARENTS?

27:29.041 --> 27:33.041
THEY DON'T WANT TO MEET HER.

27:33.083 --> 27:36.875
OH, THEY'RE COWARDS.
THEY'RE WORSE.

27:36.917 --> 27:38.333
IT'S THEIR RIGHT.

27:38.375 --> 27:41.041
WHAT ABOUT HER RIGHTS?
WHAT ABOUT HER LIFE?

27:41.083 --> 27:43.583
SHE WON'T LAST THE DAY.
SO WHAT?

27:43.625 --> 27:46.583
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHEN.

27:46.625 --> 27:48.041
AND THEY JUST...

27:48.083 --> 27:50.125
(beeping continues)

27:50.166 --> 27:52.125
THEY SAY THEY WANT
TO BE PARENTS,

27:52.166 --> 27:54.417
BUT PARENTING IS MORE THAN
ONESIES AND BASSINETS.

27:54.458 --> 27:55.917
IT'S A LIFELONG COMMITMENT,

27:55.959 --> 27:59.250
NO MATTER HOW LONG OR SHORT
THAT LIFE IS.
COOPER.

28:00.917 --> 28:03.125
THEY DON'T DESERVE HER.

28:03.166 --> 28:05.959
(beeping continues)

28:06.000 --> 28:09.417
(babies crying)

28:09.458 --> 28:12.166
(whispers) OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

28:19.208 --> 28:20.875
SHELDON.
HEY.

28:20.917 --> 28:23.959
JUST THE MAN
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.
OH, SORRY. I'M BUSY.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.959
IT'LL JUST TAKE A SEC.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.041
I SAID NO, CHARLOTTE.

28:28.083 --> 28:29.875
I AM SORRY,

28:29.917 --> 28:32.125
BUT I AM TIRED OF BEING
THE SOUNDING BOARD

28:32.166 --> 28:34.125
FOR ALL THE WOMEN
AROUND HERE.

28:34.166 --> 28:36.375
I CAN'T SOLVE EVERYONE'S
PROBLEMS, NOR DO I WANT TO.

28:36.417 --> 28:38.041
I HAVE A LIFE OF MY OWN.

28:38.083 --> 28:40.041
LISTEN, I'M A MAN
AND A THERAPIST.

28:40.083 --> 28:42.375
I LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT
THAT MAKES ME SENSITIVE.

28:42.417 --> 28:45.125
BUT DO I CARE
WHAT DRESS YOU WEAR?

28:45.166 --> 28:48.875
I MEAN, I'VE BECOME THE GUY
WHO'S NOT YOUR BOYFRIEND,

28:48.917 --> 28:50.875
WHO GETS TREATED LIKE
A BOYFRIEND WHEN IT COMES TO

28:50.917 --> 28:54.000
THE ANNOYING THINGS
THAT BOYFRIENDS DON'T WANT

28:54.041 --> 28:56.208
TO DEAL WITH, BUT THEY HAVE TO
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T,

28:56.250 --> 28:58.208
THEY DON'T GET ANY SEX,
BUT STILL... I JUST--

28:58.250 --> 29:00.291
PLEASE JUST KEEP
YOUR PROBLEMS TO YOURSELF,

29:00.333 --> 29:04.041
OR AT LEAST
JUST AWAY FROM ME.

29:04.083 --> 29:07.500
I AM RESIGNING
AS THE NOT-BOYFRIEND BOYFRIEND.

29:07.542 --> 29:09.792
WELL, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

29:09.834 --> 29:13.041
PASS IT ON.
I WILL.

29:13.083 --> 29:16.041
I-I GUESS I'LL GET
YOUR CHECK ANOTHER TIME.

29:16.083 --> 29:18.041
FUND-RAISER FOR
THE PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY UNIT.

29:18.083 --> 29:20.083
YOU PLEDGED $1,000.

29:30.250 --> 29:32.750
YOU NEED TO STEP UP.

29:32.792 --> 29:35.041
WITH YOUR WOMEN.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.417
MINE'S NOT COMPLAINING.

29:36.458 --> 29:38.417
YOU BOTH HAVE AMAZING WOMEN
IN YOUR LIVES,

29:38.458 --> 29:41.709
YOU GET ALL THE PERKS,
BUT YOU NEED TO BE THERE

29:41.750 --> 29:43.959
FOR THE NEUROSES
AND THE INSECURITIES

29:44.000 --> 29:46.458
AND THE EXISTENTIAL CRISES
THAT PLAGUE THEM.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.041
I-I DON'T WANT TO PICK OUT
VIOLET'S PHOTO SHOOT WARDROBE.

29:49.083 --> 29:51.250
AND--AND ADDISON IS GRIEVING
AND NAOMI IS--

29:51.291 --> 29:53.792
NAOMI'S NOT ONE OF OURS.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.083
WHAT?

29:58.125 --> 30:00.291
I-I CAN'T BE
THE NOT-BOYFRIEND BOYFRIEND.

30:00.333 --> 30:02.000
JUST--NOT ANYMORE.

30:02.041 --> 30:04.959
IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU JUST
NEED TO BE A BOYFRIEND.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
LOOK, I LIVE WITH VIOLET'S
NEUROSES EVERY DAY

30:08.041 --> 30:09.792
AND EVERY NIGHT.

30:09.834 --> 30:11.792
AND SAM GETS
MORE THAN HIS SHARE--

30:11.834 --> 30:13.333
(groans) WHEW.

30:13.375 --> 30:16.500
THIS IS NOT ABOUT US.
WHAT HE'S TRYING TO SAY IS,

30:16.542 --> 30:19.375
YOU NEED TO FIND
A WOMAN OF YOUR OWN.

30:19.417 --> 30:22.375
BUT SINCE, ACCORDING TO YOU,
I HAVE TWO, I'M THE EXPERT,

30:22.417 --> 30:25.750
