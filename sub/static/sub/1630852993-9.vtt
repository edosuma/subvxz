is for me.

with that at all.

is for everybody.

you tried something new.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.799
S'mores!

10:33.883 --> 10:37.219
I think somebody
followed us home.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.221
-[raccoons chittering]
-[gasps] Wildlife!

10:40.639 --> 10:41.515
And...

10:43.809 --> 10:45.227
And stars!

10:45.311 --> 10:47.313
Now, this is for me.

10:47.396 --> 10:51.650
It's not exactly roughing it,
but it's still great.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.402
It's better than roughing it.

10:53.486 --> 10:57.239
I call it "smoothing it."

10:57.323 --> 11:01.118
[laughs] I think
I love smoothing it.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.245
-Me, too.
-Me three.
