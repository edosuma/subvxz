<i>Keep being funny.</i>

00:12.565 --> 00:16.525
<i>Tell jokes... at the funeral,</i>
<i>or at the party after.</i>

00:17.125 --> 00:18.645
<i>There'd better be a party after.</i>

00:19.405 --> 00:22.805
<i>You're always funny at parties.</i>
<i>You always get drunk and overexcited.</i>

00:23.165 --> 00:26.685
<i>Running around like a fat, little</i>
<i>annoying Santa with your rosy cheeks,</i>

00:26.765 --> 00:28.125
<i>making everyone laugh.</i>

00:28.725 --> 00:30.925
<i>Then you have a sort of spiritual hangover</i>

00:31.005 --> 00:32.685
<i>worried you'd offended so and so.</i>

00:33.285 --> 00:35.125
[laughs] <i>You never had, though.</i>

00:36.685 --> 00:37.885
<i>You just made 'em laugh.</i>

00:38.525 --> 00:39.685
<i>Just keep being funny.</i>

00:41.005 --> 00:42.165
<i>You're a lovely man.</i>

00:43.845 --> 00:45.845
[poignant music]

01:44.525 --> 01:45.365
You all right, George?

01:48.925 --> 01:49.845
What's the matter?

01:51.085 --> 01:52.085
Robbie hit me.

01:52.645 --> 01:53.565
Why?

01:53.845 --> 01:55.605
He always does, every day.

01:56.365 --> 01:57.445
Which one's Robbie?

01:59.125 --> 02:01.325
-[smaller boy] Stop it!
-The one with the branch?

02:05.245 --> 02:06.205
Are you Robbie?

02:06.925 --> 02:08.725
-Yeah.
-[Tony] Robbie, come here.

02:09.205 --> 02:10.565
Listen up, right?

02:11.485 --> 02:13.165
I'm an escaped lunatic,

02:13.405 --> 02:15.845
and I like murdering little fat kids
like you,

02:15.925 --> 02:19.205
so if you hit George or anyone else,
I'm gonna come to your house -

02:19.285 --> 02:20.205
I know where you live -

02:20.285 --> 02:23.165
and while you're asleep, I'll smash
your stupid head in with this hammer.

02:23.245 --> 02:24.165
Do you understand?

02:29.405 --> 02:31.925
I just threatened a ten-year-old kid
with a hammer.

02:32.605 --> 02:33.685
They've gotta learn.

02:33.765 --> 02:35.325
[Tony] He was bullying George, and I said

02:35.725 --> 02:38.605
I'd murder him in his sleep
if he did it again.

02:44.085 --> 02:46.085
-Oh... Hello.
-Hi.

02:46.445 --> 02:48.805
He's going to murder a kid with a hammer

02:48.885 --> 02:50.205
if he doesn't behave.

02:51.485 --> 02:54.525
[laughs] So did you...
go on your date, then?

02:54.605 --> 02:55.445
Yeah.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.085
Was it a success?

02:57.165 --> 02:59.525
No, it was... awful...

03:00.285 --> 03:03.125
-awkward... just the worst.
-[snickers]

03:03.565 --> 03:06.965
The one good thing about my life is
that I never have to do that shit again.

03:07.045 --> 03:08.485
Oh, I know what you mean.

03:08.565 --> 03:10.885
You know, I'm genuinely happy on my own.

03:10.965 --> 03:11.965
Just me and the dog.

03:12.045 --> 03:14.005
-Me and my cat.
-[Tony] Exactly.

03:14.765 --> 03:17.365
When the dog goes, and him,

03:17.925 --> 03:21.405
I'll have no responsibility
for anything ever again.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.325
I can do what I like.

03:23.725 --> 03:24.645
Mm-hm.

03:25.725 --> 03:28.045
Well, you'll never have
to come here again, so...

03:28.725 --> 03:29.565
[Emma laughs]

03:29.645 --> 03:31.645
[clock ticking]

03:32.845 --> 03:34.125
-Right.
-Okay.

03:34.685 --> 03:35.805
-I've gotta--
-Yeah.

03:35.885 --> 03:37.445
-See you.
-See you later.

03:49.405 --> 03:50.645
Valerie, um...

03:50.845 --> 03:52.925
call me when my girlfriend
gets here, please.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.605
But you'll see her.

03:55.405 --> 03:56.245
What?

03:56.525 --> 03:58.085
Yeah, just call me, huh?

03:58.725 --> 04:00.205
She's bringing me in a treat.

04:00.685 --> 04:01.525
Women.

04:01.925 --> 04:03.245
Bloody love 'em, though.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.125
Oh, hey. How was the date?

04:08.205 --> 04:09.045
The worst.

04:09.125 --> 04:10.085
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

04:10.165 --> 04:13.165
-I thought you'd have so much in common.
-Well, she didn't want to be there,

04:13.245 --> 04:15.565
she drank like a fish,
swore like a trooper,

04:15.645 --> 04:18.365
er, she was narcissistic, rude.

04:18.445 --> 04:19.325
Yeah, exactly.

04:20.485 --> 04:23.445
Good one. Luckily, I got it in first
that I didn't want to be there either,

04:24.045 --> 04:25.765
and that I miss my wife, and that...

04:26.645 --> 04:27.685
I wanna kill myself.

04:27.965 --> 04:31.005
And then she teased me
that I couldn't commit suicide

04:31.085 --> 04:32.245
as well as her dead husband.

04:32.325 --> 04:33.845
-[Braden] Sounds brilliant.
-[Tony] Yeah.

04:33.925 --> 04:36.485
Then I tried to knock a couple of muggers
off a moped.

04:37.085 --> 04:38.245
Stole their hammer.

04:38.325 --> 04:39.525
You were mugged again?

04:39.605 --> 04:40.445
No.

04:40.925 --> 04:41.925
A woman was...

04:42.165 --> 04:43.405
But as they went past me...

04:44.845 --> 04:47.245
I've always wanted to knock a twat
off a motorbike.

04:47.325 --> 04:49.645
I hate the way they rev up
for no reason.

04:49.885 --> 04:53.165
The fact they were muggers was a bonus.
It sort of justified it.

04:53.525 --> 04:55.205
And what d'you mean,
you stole their hammer?

04:55.365 --> 04:58.005
I confiscated it, really.
They dropped it, so I thought,

04:58.085 --> 04:58.965
"I'll have that."

04:59.045 --> 05:03.005
It's a good one as well,
so not a complete waste of an evening.

05:03.725 --> 05:06.205
-[drawer opens]
-[hammer clatters]

05:06.285 --> 05:07.165
[drawer slams]

05:07.845 --> 05:09.005
[Braden smacks his lips]

05:09.085 --> 05:10.005
Good.

05:11.525 --> 05:13.325
Can I just talk to you
about something a sec?

05:13.765 --> 05:14.605
Yeah.

05:24.365 --> 05:25.405
[Braden exhales]

05:25.925 --> 05:27.605
Um, did you hear about Julian?

05:28.245 --> 05:30.925
-The guy who distributes the newspapers.
-Yeah.

05:31.325 --> 05:32.885
He was found dead this morning.

05:33.725 --> 05:35.005
From an overdose, heroin.

05:37.285 --> 05:38.205
Yep.

05:39.645 --> 05:41.125
It's so sad. I didn't even...

05:41.685 --> 05:43.085
I... I had no idea. I...

05:45.885 --> 05:46.965
I gave him the money.

05:48.125 --> 05:49.085
For what?

05:50.845 --> 05:51.685
For drugs.

05:53.125 --> 05:55.805
Yeah, but you couldn't have known
that he would overdose, though.

05:57.685 --> 05:58.525
Well...

05:58.605 --> 06:00.205
-Fuck's sake, Tony.
-What?

06:00.485 --> 06:02.925
Don't say that.
Don't even joke about things like that.

06:03.165 --> 06:04.925
What? Why? What's...

06:05.005 --> 06:07.245
Because you're the godfather to my son.

06:07.525 --> 06:09.725
-Right--
-Because you're not a fucking psychopath.

06:09.805 --> 06:11.085
-Okay.
-Why would you say...

06:11.165 --> 06:12.805
Why would you even tell me that?

06:14.605 --> 06:15.565
You didn't know.

06:17.085 --> 06:20.045
-Just tell me you didn't know.
-Right. I couldn't know...

06:20.125 --> 06:21.365
-Right.
-...it was gonna...

06:22.205 --> 06:23.165
you know, work.

06:23.725 --> 06:25.845
"Work"? Are you fucking kidding me?

06:25.925 --> 06:28.725
He was a heroin addict, okay?
That's what he did.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.365
Right? It's what he wanted, obviously.

06:31.645 --> 06:33.005
-So--
-Tell me that you didn't know

06:33.085 --> 06:36.925
that he was gonna kill himself, or I'm not
gonna let you see George again, okay?

06:38.805 --> 06:39.645
I didn't know.

06:40.525 --> 06:41.445
Obviously not.

06:43.725 --> 06:44.565
Okay.

06:45.445 --> 06:47.125
You didn't... Yeah, you didn't know.

06:50.725 --> 06:52.205
[keyboard clicking]

06:53.565 --> 06:54.605
[Lenny] Here she is.

06:55.205 --> 06:56.605
-Who?
-[Lenny] My bird.

06:57.445 --> 06:59.565
-[scoffing] My bird.
-[Len] Come in. Take a seat.

07:01.445 --> 07:03.925
-Bread pudding delivery.
-[Lenny] Lovely. Thanks, love.

07:04.005 --> 07:07.805
Um, everyone, this is my girlfriend, June.
June, everyone.

07:07.885 --> 07:09.525
-Hello.
-Hi, June.

07:10.365 --> 07:12.925
So... what's it like going out with...

07:13.925 --> 07:14.765
that?

07:16.445 --> 07:17.285
It's lovely.

07:17.365 --> 07:18.285
-Is it?
-[June] Yeah.

07:18.765 --> 07:20.045
[Tony] What do you mean?

07:20.125 --> 07:21.365
He's good with my boy.

07:21.445 --> 07:22.965
-Right.
-[June] Got a lot in common,

07:23.045 --> 07:24.405
-my two little fatties.
-[Tony] Oh.

07:24.685 --> 07:27.125
[June] Mm-hm. I love it when
they fight over Creme Eggs.

07:27.205 --> 07:28.565
-Not fighting.
-You do.

07:28.645 --> 07:30.485
No, he's just... He gets a bit grabby.

07:30.565 --> 07:35.365
[Tony] Aw! He tells me you were attracted
to his style even before his personality.

07:36.365 --> 07:37.685
-Yeah.
-[Tony] Wow.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.685
-Love everything about him.
-[Tony] Right.

07:40.205 --> 07:41.285
Especially his body.

07:42.285 --> 07:43.125
Really?

07:43.205 --> 07:44.645
[Tony] Wh-wh-why?

07:45.165 --> 07:46.485
Why? What's...

07:46.565 --> 07:47.445
He's 'ot.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.005
'Ot?

07:50.085 --> 07:52.685
Yeah, like his body temperature's warm,
like hot to the touch.

07:52.765 --> 07:54.845
-Oh, right.
-So when he's naked, it's like cuddling

07:54.925 --> 07:56.085
-a big baby.
-[Tony, gasps] Oh.

07:56.165 --> 07:58.805
And his skin's dead smooth
when he gets out the bath.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.765
Very cuddly, yeah.

08:01.045 --> 08:04.605
And have you noticed the roll of, um...

08:05.325 --> 08:07.125
flab on his neck?

08:07.445 --> 08:08.885
-Back fat?
-[Tony] No, not back fat,

08:09.005 --> 08:10.845
but we'll come back to that, thank you.

08:10.925 --> 08:13.965
Um, no. Next time he's lying naked,

08:14.045 --> 08:17.205
just grab the back of his neck.
Or get on him, if you like.

08:17.325 --> 08:20.125
Sit on him,
grab the roll of fat on his back there,

08:20.205 --> 08:24.205
and blump him around the room
like a big space hopper.

08:24.285 --> 08:26.085
-That'd be good.
-Don't want to hurt him, do I?

08:26.165 --> 08:28.445
No. You just wanna cudd... I know.

08:28.525 --> 08:30.485
Wanna see a sexy picture of him
just out the bath?

08:30.565 --> 08:32.525
-Yes, please, June.
-[June] I've got one here.

08:32.605 --> 08:35.325
[chuckling] You should probably...
head off, love, shouldn't you?

08:35.405 --> 08:37.005
-Yeah.
-Well, come back any time, though,

08:37.085 --> 08:39.525
'cause we're a local paper,
so we need sort of... Aw!

08:39.725 --> 08:42.165
We need sort of local interest stories
like this.

08:42.445 --> 08:44.365
-Ah, I forgot the custard.
-Not to worry.

08:44.445 --> 08:46.205
Okay, next time, though.

08:46.965 --> 08:48.965
-[June] Never mind.
-Yeah, all right. See you, love.

08:49.045 --> 08:51.885
-Um, thanks for...
-See you later.

08:51.965 --> 08:52.965
Nice to meet you all.

08:53.045 --> 08:55.125
-Nice to meet you.
-[Tony] Lovely to meet you. Cheers.

08:55.205 --> 08:56.525
-[June] Ta-ra.
-Thanks for the pud.

08:56.845 --> 08:57.965
[June] You're welcome!

08:59.045 --> 09:01.805
-[sighs] Fuckin' hell.
-You make a lovely couple.

09:02.045 --> 09:02.885
Cheers.

09:05.485 --> 09:06.965
Someone for everyone, isn't there?

09:08.245 --> 09:09.085
Thanks.

09:11.045 --> 09:12.165
She's brilliant, mate.

09:13.205 --> 09:14.165
[Lenny] Cheers.

09:23.085 --> 09:24.245
[indistinct chatter]

09:29.925 --> 09:30.965
-Oh.
-Hi.

09:31.045 --> 09:32.845
[Emma] Hi. Twice in one day?

09:33.645 --> 09:37.205
-Somebody's popular.
-It's just a slow workday, so--

09:37.285 --> 09:39.085
-Wish I had a slow workday.
-You busy?

09:39.165 --> 09:41.005
Er... Yeah, just a bit. [chuckles]

09:41.085 --> 09:43.725
Just... Well, have a sit down.

09:50.805 --> 09:51.765
[clock ticking]

09:52.525 --> 09:54.245
-That's all I've got.
-[laughs]

09:55.205 --> 09:56.205
God. [slaps her leg]

09:56.805 --> 09:58.725
-Okay, back to work.
-[laughs]

09:59.365 --> 10:00.525
-[Emma] Bye!
-Bye.

10:01.005 --> 10:02.925
[chuckles]

10:03.725 --> 10:04.925
[sniffs and chuckles]

10:05.845 --> 10:08.125
[woman] Well,
I didn't breastfeed this time,

10:08.205 --> 10:09.725
not convenient.

10:09.805 --> 10:13.485
Obviously, I was still lactating,
so I thought, "Waste not, want not,"

10:13.605 --> 10:15.365
so I expressed...

10:15.445 --> 10:17.485
and started making rice puddings.

10:18.125 --> 10:20.045
-Out of your breast milk?
-Good idea.

10:20.125 --> 10:22.085
It's more natural,
if you think about it, isn't it?

10:22.445 --> 10:25.085
For people to eat a pudding
made from human milk.

10:25.165 --> 10:26.565
That's what we're used to, isn't it?

10:26.645 --> 10:28.125
Well, when we're babies, maybe.

10:28.205 --> 10:29.725
So I kept expressing--

10:29.805 --> 10:31.765
And making... rice puddings.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.245
Do other people eat these?

10:33.325 --> 10:34.845
Yeah, they lap it up.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.325
And they know it's your breast milk?

10:36.405 --> 10:37.405
Yeah.

10:37.685 --> 10:39.125
<i>Who</i> eats these?

10:39.205 --> 10:40.885
Mr. Crosby at number five.

10:40.965 --> 10:42.285
He can't get enough.

10:42.365 --> 10:44.565
-I mean, I can't make huge puddings.
-Sure.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.525
Sometimes I have to top it up
with cow's milk.

10:46.725 --> 10:47.645
Right.

10:47.725 --> 10:49.005
Anyway, do you want to try?

10:50.005 --> 10:51.605
Nah. We're fine, thank you--

10:51.685 --> 10:52.845
[slurping]

10:55.205 --> 10:56.965
-Oh, God... Oh, God!
-[slurping]

10:57.045 --> 10:58.485
-Are you okay?
-[Tony gags]

10:58.565 --> 11:00.685
No, it's the sight of him just...
-[slurping]

11:01.085 --> 11:03.005
-slurping it up like a fat...
-[gags]

11:03.085 --> 11:03.965
fuckin' Labrador.

11:04.405 --> 11:05.245
Oh, God.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.445
[coughs] It's--

11:07.525 --> 11:09.125
[retches] Oh, God.

11:09.565 --> 11:10.445
[Tony retching]

11:10.805 --> 11:11.965
Change the subject.

11:12.045 --> 11:14.445
So for the bread,
I use my own vaginal yeast.

11:14.525 --> 11:15.965
[retching]

11:17.805 --> 11:18.725
[Tony] Thank you.

11:20.645 --> 11:24.365
You <i>never</i> need to use
your own vaginal yeast to make bread.

11:24.525 --> 11:26.965
If you're making bread,
"Oh, we've run out of yeast.

11:27.045 --> 11:28.725
Oh, I know. I can use--"
"Forget it.

11:28.805 --> 11:31.045
I'll go to the shops.
We'll get a lovely loaf."

11:31.125 --> 11:33.805
You've still got the fuckin' milk
around your mouth.

11:33.885 --> 11:35.005
Oh, you pig!

11:36.685 --> 11:38.885
I've got to walk the dog.
I'll see you later.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.045
[Pat] All right?

12:18.245 --> 12:19.845
-[Tony] Yeah.
-Been waiting for you.

12:20.125 --> 12:20.965
Why?

12:21.725 --> 12:22.565
Postcard.

12:23.005 --> 12:24.685
-Who's that from?
-You, obviously.

12:25.325 --> 12:26.165
What's it say?

12:26.365 --> 12:27.965
-You know what it says.
-Go on.

12:30.125 --> 12:33.365
"To Pat. Stop reading my postcards,
you nosy, scruffy cunt."

12:35.325 --> 12:36.405
Not very nice, is it?

12:36.685 --> 12:38.845
It's not addressed to you, is it?
It's addressed to me.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.205
Yeah, but you knew I'd read it.

12:40.285 --> 12:41.405
And that's my point.

12:42.725 --> 12:44.445
Good girl. Come on.

12:45.845 --> 12:47.885
I'm <i>always</i> angry.

12:47.965 --> 12:49.005
[therapist, sighing] Yeah.

12:49.085 --> 12:50.965
I hate the fact that people think...

12:51.525 --> 12:54.165
they can get away with being shit,
you know?

12:55.085 --> 12:56.525
I was wound up the other day

12:56.645 --> 12:58.925
by a woman walking along the street
next to me,

12:59.005 --> 13:01.165
and she was shuffling.
She wouldn't pick her...

13:01.245 --> 13:02.325
Pick your fuckin' feet up.

13:02.405 --> 13:04.365
Has no one ever told you
how to fuckin' walk?

13:04.445 --> 13:05.285
You're an adult.

13:05.365 --> 13:07.445
I wanted to punch a bloke
in the cafe yesterday

13:07.525 --> 13:08.685
for yawning too loudly.

13:08.765 --> 13:09.845
He was doing this...

13:09.925 --> 13:11.445
[exaggerated yawn]

13:11.525 --> 13:12.765
Shut the fuck up!

13:12.845 --> 13:13.845
No one cares.

13:13.925 --> 13:16.005
It's like celebrating being tired.

13:17.405 --> 13:20.725
We all get irritated by things, okay?

13:21.005 --> 13:23.245
I hate people who eat the ice
in their gin and tonics.

13:23.325 --> 13:24.285
So do I.

13:24.565 --> 13:27.885
But I bet your first thought isn't,
"I hope he chokes on that,

13:27.965 --> 13:30.725
and as he's on the floor gasping for air,

13:30.805 --> 13:32.005
I wanna lean in and go,

13:32.245 --> 13:35.365
"That's what you get for eating ice,
you fuckin' moron."

13:36.005 --> 13:36.845
No, it isn't.

13:37.685 --> 13:39.445
Welcome to the contents of my head.

13:42.365 --> 13:44.085
[yawning]

13:45.325 --> 13:46.285
Excuse me.

13:52.245 --> 13:54.405
-Spare a moment for homeless children?
-Sorry, no.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.245
Don't care about children in poverty,
then?

13:56.845 --> 13:58.885
Not at the moment.
I've got bigger problems.

13:58.965 --> 14:01.325
Do bigger problems exist
than the desperate poverty of a child?

14:01.605 --> 14:04.365
Sorry, I thought me saying I was busy
was enough.

14:04.445 --> 14:07.645
What's the guilt tripping?
And don't give me this altruism shit.

14:07.725 --> 14:10.685
You're not a volunteer.
Everyone knows you're getting paid.

14:10.765 --> 14:13.965
You don't give a fuck about the charity
or poverty-stricken kids. You want money.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.045
I'd effectively be paying your wages,

14:16.125 --> 14:17.565
you wiry, little twat.

14:24.125 --> 14:25.525
[whistles] Four-eyes!

14:42.645 --> 14:43.485
[groans]

14:44.045 --> 14:45.525
Please can I be in the paper?

14:46.045 --> 14:46.885
For what?

14:46.965 --> 14:47.845
Me.

14:49.005 --> 14:50.645
-My story.
-What story?

14:50.725 --> 14:53.805
I've got stories. You'll do stories
about anything in here, won't you?

14:53.885 --> 14:55.965
What was it last week,
"Woman Finds Hat in a Tree"?

14:56.045 --> 14:57.645
[snickers] Please...

14:57.725 --> 14:59.285
come and have a look at my home.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.485
-[Tony] Why?
-This is just the tip of the iceberg.

15:01.565 --> 15:02.405
You don't know.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.765
No, I believe you.

15:03.845 --> 15:05.565
It's a tr... trevor tro... treasure trove.

15:05.965 --> 15:08.405
-Easy for you to say.
-Collected loads of things over the years.

15:08.485 --> 15:10.645
Memorabilia and trophies and...

15:11.085 --> 15:12.085
my exploits.

15:12.445 --> 15:16.165
If you're not convinced, I promise
I'll never darken your door again.

15:16.445 --> 15:18.525
So if we come and look at your house,

15:18.765 --> 15:20.125
you'll never bother us--

15:20.205 --> 15:21.045
Never. No.

15:23.165 --> 15:24.125
It'll make my year.

15:26.645 --> 15:27.925
D'you wanna go have a look?

15:28.365 --> 15:29.445
Yeah. [sighs]

15:30.205 --> 15:31.605
Please bring the new girl.

15:31.685 --> 15:33.765
D'you want to watch us cover this story?

15:34.445 --> 15:35.685
-Yeah. All right.
-[Tony] Yeah?

15:42.965 --> 15:44.205
Here we go.

15:47.765 --> 15:48.605
Here we are.

15:51.565 --> 15:53.485
-[Tony] Fuckin' hell.
-[Brian] Come in.

15:53.885 --> 15:55.445
This is the dining room.

15:57.125 --> 15:58.445
Okay, come through.

16:02.525 --> 16:03.765
[exhales]

16:03.845 --> 16:05.925
This is what I've been talking about.
This is...

16:11.045 --> 16:11.885
Questions?

16:12.525 --> 16:13.685
What's that smell?

16:13.765 --> 16:14.605
Which one?

16:14.685 --> 16:16.525
Like a clawing thing
in the back of the throat.

16:16.605 --> 16:18.125
-Back of the throat. Dead mice.
-Yeah--

16:18.445 --> 16:21.765
Back of the room. Back corner.
Basically, I put some traps there

16:21.845 --> 16:24.325
a couple of years ago,
and I can't get to them, so...

16:25.005 --> 16:26.165
Any other questions?

16:28.165 --> 16:29.605
-What are they?
-Cockroaches.

16:30.445 --> 16:31.325
I collect them.

16:31.405 --> 16:33.525
Basically, these little fellas are, um--

16:33.605 --> 16:34.685
-Don't open it.
-Okay.

16:36.205 --> 16:39.045
My rule is, if you come onto my property,
then I own you.

16:39.485 --> 16:40.325
Okay?

16:41.365 --> 16:42.205
Question three?

16:42.685 --> 16:44.565
-How long have you been doing this?
-Ooh.

16:45.765 --> 16:47.645
When did my wife leave me? [gasps]

16:47.725 --> 16:48.725
Seven years.

16:49.005 --> 16:51.605
Seven years ago. I thought I could
do what I like with the place.

16:52.605 --> 16:53.605
So I just went for it.

16:53.685 --> 16:55.805
Yeah, which brings me to my next question,

16:55.885 --> 16:57.765
-and don't take this the wrong way...
-No.

16:57.845 --> 16:59.565
Why have you never considered suicide?

16:59.645 --> 17:00.485
I have.

17:01.245 --> 17:03.205
And why... didn't you go through with it?

17:03.285 --> 17:05.485
Because I decided it was too good for me.

17:05.765 --> 17:06.605
Wow.

17:07.525 --> 17:09.085
[Brian] That's what you're dealing with.

17:09.645 --> 17:10.925
-Cup of tea?
-Definitely not.

17:11.005 --> 17:11.885
[Brian] Okay.

17:12.685 --> 17:15.765
Brian, this isn't right for a local paper.
How can I do a...

17:16.645 --> 17:18.125
There's no story here, mate.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.165
Can I stay and try and find one?

17:20.885 --> 17:21.965
-[Tony] Really?
-Yeah.

17:22.325 --> 17:23.365
[Tony] Okay.

17:24.325 --> 17:25.285
See you later.

17:26.325 --> 17:27.725
-Cheers, Brian.
-[Len] Yeah.

17:27.805 --> 17:29.205
-[Brian] Thank you.
-Bye.

17:29.285 --> 17:30.125
Where are you going?

17:30.205 --> 17:31.845
-I'm coming with you.
-No, you're not.

17:32.725 --> 17:34.045
[whispering] Don't leave her with him.

17:34.125 --> 17:35.365
-But it stinks.
-Yeah.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.645
[Brian] What d'you wanna know?
Where'd you wanna go?

17:37.725 --> 17:39.485
[Sandy] Just show me
what you've got, really.

17:39.885 --> 17:42.525
[Brian] What I've got? [laughs]
What haven't I got?

17:47.565 --> 17:48.685
Okay, thank you. Yeah.

17:49.325 --> 17:50.645
No, thanks for letting me know.

17:56.925 --> 17:59.925
[silly high voice]
Hello, everybody! Hello!

18:00.005 --> 18:01.925
[silly deep voice]
Hello, everybody! Hello.

18:02.005 --> 18:03.165
Say hello, everybody.

18:03.285 --> 18:04.845
-Hello.
-[silly deep voice] Hello.

18:04.925 --> 18:06.165
[high voice] Hello, Mr. Punch.

18:06.245 --> 18:08.085
[low voice] Hello, Mrs. Punch.
What are you up to?

18:08.165 --> 18:10.365
Oh, nothing much. Nothing much.

18:10.445 --> 18:12.885
Yes, you have.
You've been shagging Mickey the Gypsy.

18:12.965 --> 18:14.085
No, I haven't.

18:14.165 --> 18:15.605
Yes, you have.

18:15.685 --> 18:17.325
Ooh, calm down, Brian.

18:17.405 --> 18:19.565
Calm down?
You're telling me to calm down?

18:19.845 --> 18:21.965
Huh? You've made me a laughing stock
round the village,

18:22.045 --> 18:23.365
and she's telling <i>me</i> to calm down.

18:23.445 --> 18:25.485
She's been shagging anything that moves.

18:25.565 --> 18:28.685
For 18 months, she's shagging
Mickey the Gypsy down Green Lane.

18:29.165 --> 18:31.525
My wife is a slut. There's your headline.

18:31.765 --> 18:32.805
"My Wife's a Slut."

18:33.525 --> 18:35.485
This woman has destroyed me.

18:37.285 --> 18:38.965
Yes, please, take a picture. Thank you.

18:39.365 --> 18:40.205
[camera clicks]

18:49.125 --> 18:50.245
Tony, can I have a word?

18:50.325 --> 18:51.605
-[Tony] Now?
-Yeah, now.

18:55.365 --> 18:56.205
Shut the door.

18:57.405 --> 18:58.365
Sit down.

19:00.725 --> 19:02.325
I just had a phone call from the school.

19:02.565 --> 19:05.085
Not as a story or anything,
but as a parent.

19:05.165 --> 19:07.485
Apparently, a middle-aged man
threatened a ten-year-old child

19:07.565 --> 19:08.445
with a hammer today.

19:10.565 --> 19:12.765
You threatened a child
with a fucking hammer.

19:12.845 --> 19:14.165
Who told you it was me?

19:14.245 --> 19:15.805
Nobody. They don't know it was you.

19:15.885 --> 19:18.085
I know it was you
'cause I've seen the fucking hammer!

19:19.525 --> 19:20.685
He was bullying George.

19:20.765 --> 19:23.245
What the fuck is wrong with you, Tony?
I can't...

19:23.525 --> 19:26.725
I can take all the insults, you know,
the lateness.

19:26.965 --> 19:29.005
Fill your boots with that shit,
but you can't...

19:29.085 --> 19:32.125
If you carry on like this,
people are gonna get hurt, right?

19:32.205 --> 19:33.445
-And it's not gonna be George.
-I know.

19:33.525 --> 19:35.325
I was trying to stop George getting hurt.

19:35.405 --> 19:37.005
I get enough grief from Jill as it is,

19:37.285 --> 19:38.765
letting George see you, but I do it

19:39.085 --> 19:41.245
because I know it makes you happy,

19:41.325 --> 19:44.445
but I can't risk that anymore.
Do you understand?

19:49.605 --> 19:52.125
-I'm fucked up.
-You're not fu... That's not good enough.

19:52.205 --> 19:53.965
That is not good enough, Tony.

19:54.045 --> 19:56.165
That's letting yourself
off the hook again.

19:56.565 --> 19:59.165
People who are fucked up
don't choose to be like that.

19:59.245 --> 20:01.165
You're doing this on purpose.
You know what you're doing.

20:01.245 --> 20:02.725
This is the worst thing you've done.

20:02.805 --> 20:05.285
I don't even know
what you're fighting anymore.

20:05.365 --> 20:08.445
I don't get this, okay?
There is no enemy in this story.

20:08.525 --> 20:10.245
This is... You're doing this to yourself.

20:10.325 --> 20:13.285
I'm in pain, all right?
I'm in fucking pain all the time,

20:13.365 --> 20:14.845
and I do shit like this

20:14.925 --> 20:17.325
[tearfully] 'cause it makes me
feel better for a split second.

20:17.645 --> 20:20.205
Other people are in pain as well.
Other people have shit going on.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.765
Other people have things to deal with.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.685
I just want to be out of pain.

20:23.765 --> 20:26.245
Either live without pain
or die without pain,

20:26.325 --> 20:27.685
whichever one comes first.

20:27.765 --> 20:30.165
-I choose that, all right?
-Okay, listen to me.

20:30.245 --> 20:33.685
If you're saying to me
that you can't be trusted,

20:33.765 --> 20:37.085
that you're not accountable
for your actions, then that's fine,

20:37.165 --> 20:38.525
if that's what you're saying.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.445
But that means
that you don't get to see George.

20:40.925 --> 20:44.725
Because if you're saying I have to choose
between the safety of my son...

20:44.805 --> 20:45.805
and you,

20:45.885 --> 20:49.125
then I choose my son every fucking time.
Do you understand me?

20:49.245 --> 20:50.605
It doesn't even come close.

20:52.165 --> 20:54.845
-I'd never do anything to hurt George.
-Look what you've done already.

20:54.925 --> 20:55.885
I know.

20:56.925 --> 20:58.605
I won't do anything like this again.

20:59.285 --> 21:00.405
Well, let's see, okay?

21:09.245 --> 21:10.965
[Lenny sighs wearily]

21:11.045 --> 21:12.245
What was it like?

21:12.605 --> 21:15.205
-Absolutely mental.
-[Kath] Why?

21:16.165 --> 21:17.365
[Lenny] It's just full of shit.

21:17.445 --> 21:18.525
Just old shit.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.885
He did a puppet show!

21:21.285 --> 21:23.605
-Puppet show?
-Yeah, like an actual puppet show.

21:23.845 --> 21:25.645
How are you even gonna deal
with all of that?

21:25.725 --> 21:26.565
It's quite sad.

21:27.365 --> 21:28.565
Excited to start it.

21:30.245 --> 21:31.445
Why is it empty?

21:32.085 --> 21:33.085
What d'you mean?

21:33.165 --> 21:37.605
Well, usually, there's like a... romantic
scene or a castle or something inside.

21:37.685 --> 21:39.965
[Kath] Yeah. This is one of them
that you're meant to put

21:40.045 --> 21:42.005
a photo of a loved one in, but...

21:42.125 --> 21:43.525
I haven't met anyone, though.

21:44.245 --> 21:45.405
[Tony] Fuck me.

21:46.045 --> 21:47.125
Put something in it.

21:47.925 --> 21:48.965
Picture of your cat,

21:49.685 --> 21:50.685
something you love.

21:51.885 --> 21:52.765
What d'you love?

21:55.245 --> 21:56.125
Loads of stuff.

21:56.405 --> 21:57.245
Go on.

21:58.525 --> 21:59.365
Go on what?

22:01.605 --> 22:03.085
What d'you mean "Go on what"?

22:03.765 --> 22:04.605
What?

22:05.445 --> 22:06.485
I said, "Go on,"

22:08.045 --> 22:09.405
and you said, "Go on what?"

22:10.565 --> 22:12.485
You haven't heard the phrase, "go on,"

22:12.925 --> 22:14.605
as in expound,

22:15.045 --> 22:16.405
give me some examples?

22:17.965 --> 22:19.205
-No.
-No?

22:20.165 --> 22:21.005
Okay.

22:21.565 --> 22:23.685
Give me some examples of things you love.

22:25.285 --> 22:26.205
[Kath exhales]

22:28.485 --> 22:30.405
[sighs] Having a laugh.

22:30.925 --> 22:32.245
-Really?
-[Kath] Yeah!

22:32.805 --> 22:35.045
You've seen the birthday cards
I buy people.

22:35.605 --> 22:37.605
Funny memes I show around on Twitter.

22:39.805 --> 22:40.685
Kevin Hart.

23:02.365 --> 23:04.125
-Fancy seeing you here.
-Oh.

23:05.325 --> 23:06.725
-You all right?
-Yeah.

23:07.445 --> 23:08.285
Good.

23:09.925 --> 23:10.765
Um...

23:11.925 --> 23:12.885
I need some advice.

23:14.085 --> 23:15.285
I wanted to kill myself.

23:16.405 --> 23:18.085
And when I couldn't, or hadn't,

23:19.125 --> 23:20.405
I thought, "Okay.

23:20.725 --> 23:23.765
If I'm gonna do this
carrying on living thing,

23:24.125 --> 23:27.125
it's gonna be on my terms,
I'm gonna do what I want,

23:28.125 --> 23:30.325
and I've always got suicide
to fall back on."

23:31.765 --> 23:33.005
Got to have a backup.

23:33.685 --> 23:34.685
[Tony chuckles]

23:36.005 --> 23:37.165
Exactly.

23:37.645 --> 23:38.925
But it didn't go to plan.

23:39.525 --> 23:40.365
Um...

23:40.885 --> 23:43.285
At first,
I thought it was like a superpower.

23:43.485 --> 23:46.125
I can do <i>anything. </i>Who cares?

23:46.205 --> 23:47.605
What's the worst that can happen?

23:47.685 --> 23:51.205
Nothing can hurt me 'cause I can
always kill myself, you know? And...

23:52.085 --> 23:52.925
But then...

23:53.645 --> 23:54.885
I realized you can't...

23:55.725 --> 23:58.445
You can't not care about things
you actually care about.

23:58.525 --> 24:00.445
You can't fool yourself and...

24:01.325 --> 24:02.445
And, er...

24:02.525 --> 24:06.485
it was something you said,
that it's not all about me,

24:07.645 --> 24:09.085
and even though I'm in pain,

24:10.085 --> 24:10.925
it's worth...

24:12.085 --> 24:14.005
sticking around to maybe...

24:15.125 --> 24:16.005
make my...

24:17.005 --> 24:20.445
little corner of the world
a slightly better place.

24:22.245 --> 24:23.405
That's all there is.

24:26.565 --> 24:28.005
Happiness is amazing.

24:29.405 --> 24:32.165
It's so amazing,
it doesn't matter if it's yours or not.

24:34.245 --> 24:35.565
There's that lovely thing,

24:36.685 --> 24:39.565
"A society grows great
when old men plant trees,

24:39.645 --> 24:42.285
the shade of which they know
they will never sit in."

24:44.245 --> 24:47.285
Good people do things for other people.

24:47.485 --> 24:48.805
That's it. The end.

24:52.405 --> 24:53.605
And you're good, Tony.

24:55.165 --> 24:56.445
You have so much to give.

24:58.645 --> 24:59.605
Smart...

24:59.965 --> 25:00.805
funny...

25:02.565 --> 25:03.405
lovely.

25:06.805 --> 25:09.005
-You forgot "sexy," but...
-Yeah, well...

25:10.405 --> 25:11.925
didn't want to be too obvious.

25:12.925 --> 25:15.285
-If you were 20 years younger, right?
-Exactly.

25:18.445 --> 25:21.565
Mind you, if I was 20 years younger,
I think I could do better.

25:21.645 --> 25:22.525
[Tony snickers]

25:23.325 --> 25:25.445
-Yeah, definitely.
-[Anne chuckles]

25:25.525 --> 25:26.885
[laughing]

25:27.805 --> 25:28.765
Ah.

25:35.125 --> 25:36.445
[Kath] All right, I'm off.

25:37.645 --> 25:38.485
Bye.

25:39.045 --> 25:41.285
-See you tomorrow.
-See ya.

25:52.565 --> 25:54.125
-See ya.
-[Sandy] Bye.

25:58.165 --> 26:00.245
[printer whirring]

26:29.725 --> 26:30.845
-[Sandy] Tony.
-Huh?

26:31.205 --> 26:32.565
Please be happy.

26:33.245 --> 26:34.205
What?

26:34.285 --> 26:35.965
[Sandy] You deserve to be happy.

26:36.045 --> 26:37.125
Please be happy.

26:38.485 --> 26:39.965
I love how much you love your wife,

26:40.565 --> 26:45.125
and I can't wait for someone
to love me as much as you love your wife.

26:45.725 --> 26:48.125
But... you can still be happy.

26:48.485 --> 26:49.445
Okay.

26:50.445 --> 26:51.645
[Sandy] You're so funny.

26:52.165 --> 26:53.725
You make me laugh all the time.

26:54.285 --> 26:55.965
Tony, you're breaking my heart.

26:56.045 --> 26:56.885
Okay.

26:58.485 --> 26:59.725
[breathes deeply]

27:01.845 --> 27:04.405
-How's the Brian story going?
-Yeah, I've got it here.

27:05.365 --> 27:06.885
-Do you want to read it?
-Yep.

27:09.725 --> 27:11.605
[sighs]

27:18.845 --> 27:19.965
[chuckles]

27:24.245 --> 27:25.085
Well,

27:25.245 --> 27:26.685
this can be the front page.

27:27.845 --> 27:28.925
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:30.405 --> 27:31.525
Oh, my God. I could cry.

27:31.605 --> 27:34.445
Don't cry, and don't be too flattered.
Have you seen our front pages?

27:34.525 --> 27:35.885
[laughing] Yeah.

27:36.485 --> 27:37.365
But still....

27:38.085 --> 27:38.965
It's really good.

27:40.005 --> 27:41.485
-Really good.
-Thank you.

28:07.765 --> 28:08.765
[Lisa clears throat]

28:13.445 --> 28:15.205

-Hey.

28:57.005 --> 28:59.325
-I knew I'd find you at the office.
