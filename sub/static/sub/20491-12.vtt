00:32.868 --> 00:36.067
Lex was right. I got the
signal from the black
box, but it's about

00:36.167 --> 00:37.634
two hundred metres away still.

00:37.734 --> 00:40.267
You know, the only thing that's
funny is this frequency is not

00:40.367 --> 00:42.834
listed in any commercial
or military records.

00:42.934 --> 00:45.934
Well, Lexa said whatever's on
that plane is a major threat.

00:46.033 --> 00:47.934
Great, how come we
never get the easy ones?

00:48.033 --> 00:50.200
Hmh.

01:09.300 --> 01:10.868
You okay?

01:40.734 --> 01:42.334
Get down!

02:01.634 --> 02:03.167
You mind telling us
what just happened?

02:03.267 --> 02:05.100
Let me tell you, you're
privileged, baby.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.200
You just saw the real thing.

02:07.300 --> 02:08.366
What real thing?

02:08.467 --> 02:09.567
Aliens.

02:09.667 --> 02:11.901
Real live, dyed in the
wool, crop circlin',

02:12.000 --> 02:15.067
saucer jockeyin',
cattle-mutilatin' aliens.

02:15.167 --> 02:18.901
And I finally got the proof.

02:24.501 --> 02:29.167
<i>Scientist Adam Kane was a
pioneer of genetic research,</i>

02:29.267 --> 02:33.100
<i>manipulating DNA to
save human lives.</i>

02:33.200 --> 02:36.567
<i>But, in many, their genes
unexpectedly mutated</i>

02:36.667 --> 02:40.033
<i>and they developed
superhuman abilities.</i>

03:09.200 --> 03:12.133
<i>Together, four of the most
powerful fight to protect a</i>

03:12.234 --> 03:15.434
<i>world that doesn't
even know they exist.</i>

03:17.467 --> 03:21.033
<i>They are... Mutant X.</i>

03:24.234 --> 03:26.067
There never is.
It's the way they do it.

03:26.167 --> 03:27.234
The aliens?

03:27.334 --> 03:28.567
Men in black.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.501
Guys that were just
shooting at us.

03:30.601 --> 03:33.267
Guess they didn't want to kill
too many witnesses all at once.

03:33.367 --> 03:36.300
Witnesses to what?

03:38.100 --> 03:40.601
To this.

03:45.267 --> 03:46.968
And you think that's an alien?

03:47.067 --> 03:51.200
Government's been working
with them for years.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.467
The government?

03:52.567 --> 03:54.133
Yeah, in collusion with
organized crime, the church

03:54.234 --> 03:55.634
and the cast of Friends.

03:55.734 --> 03:57.634
But it's... it's kind of a
long story.

03:57.734 --> 04:00.100
Hey, whoa,
whoa. Wait. Where you going?

04:00.200 --> 04:01.434
Getting the hell out of
here before they come back.

04:01.534 --> 04:04.534
No, no.
Listen... listen.

04:04.634 --> 04:06.667
I had this dream
the other night.

04:06.767 --> 04:12.033
There was... all
these lights in the sky and
there was these... anyway...

04:12.133 --> 04:14.801
I walked all the way from town
to be here right at this moment.

04:14.901 --> 04:16.634
And... and I need
to know what that means.

04:16.733 --> 04:18.399
Classic abduction profile.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.968
Drawn to the next visitation.

04:21.067 --> 04:24.300
I'm warning you, once you've
seen behind the veil,

04:24.400 --> 04:26.634
there's no going back.

04:26.734 --> 04:29.167
I think we're ready
to take that chance.

04:29.267 --> 04:31.934
Oh, yeah.

04:32.033 --> 04:33.634
Welcome to the conspiracy.

04:33.734 --> 04:35.767
Eddie. Eddie Boyle.
You guys on foot?

04:35.868 --> 04:38.567
Car's up here.

04:39.367 --> 04:41.567
<laughing>

04:41.667 --> 04:44.334
Okay, yeah. This guy seems
a little nuts. But listen.

04:44.434 --> 04:46.367
Obviously, he knows something
about what's going on here.

04:46.467 --> 04:47.767
We need to figure
out what that is.

04:47.868 --> 04:49.434
Well, honey, he doesn't know
the difference between Martians

04:49.534 --> 04:50.968
and meat loaf.

04:51.067 --> 04:53.067
<i>Shalimar, I agree with Brennan.</i>

04:53.167 --> 04:54.734
What?

04:54.834 --> 04:56.434
Look, we've been monitoring
you guys since you got to
the crash site.

04:56.534 --> 04:58.868
The very fact that that guy was
there before us means that at

04:58.968 --> 05:00.634
least he's plugged
into something.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.667
Yeah, plugged in maybe, but
he's got a few wires loose.

05:03.767 --> 05:05.400
Look, whatever's supposed to
happen is going down before

05:05.501 --> 05:07.000
eight o'clock tomorrow night.

05:07.100 --> 05:11.267
Unless you've got
something better to go on
just do it, okay?

05:12.467 --> 05:13.968
Guys, she's right.

05:14.067 --> 05:15.801
Look, we're running out of time
and we gotta figure out what

05:15.901 --> 05:17.834
the fallout is going to be from
that crash, and right now the

05:17.934 --> 05:20.067
guy you just met is our
best shot at doing that.

05:20.167 --> 05:23.501
So you want us to
stick with him?

05:23.601 --> 05:24.434
Oh, good.

05:24.534 --> 05:26.367
Here, I advise
you to wear these.

05:26.467 --> 05:27.667
They're foil-lined.

05:27.767 --> 05:29.634
Stops them from, you
know, tracking us by our

05:29.734 --> 05:32.367
thought-waves?

05:32.467 --> 05:34.701
Oh, yeah.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.334
This is gonna
be enlightening.

05:36.434 --> 05:39.067
<laughs>

05:39.167 --> 05:41.334
I'm gonna keep at that
satellite search, see if I can

05:41.434 --> 05:44.000
turn up anything on
our "Men in Black".

05:44.100 --> 05:46.300
Something tells me that
won't be too fruitful.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.734
That's all we've got.

05:49.834 --> 05:52.734
Look, Lexa, I know it's hard.

05:52.834 --> 05:53.901
I... I mean, losing
your brother...

05:54.000 --> 05:56.467
Jess, don't.

05:56.567 --> 06:00.100
Don't what?

06:00.200 --> 06:01.200
Lexa, I care.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.334
It...

06:03.434 --> 06:06.767
Well, I'm fine.

06:06.868 --> 06:09.300
Look, just keep trying
to track these guys down.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.834
I'm gonna contact the
Dominion and fill them in.

06:25.567 --> 06:27.033
You retrieved the cargo?

06:27.133 --> 06:28.901
We did.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.567
But there was a complication.

06:30.667 --> 06:31.901
We were observed.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.133
Three people.

06:33.234 --> 06:34.634
Two men and a woman.

06:34.734 --> 06:38.667
They got their information
somewhere: Find the source
and close it.

06:38.767 --> 06:41.968
We cannot afford loose ends.

06:43.868 --> 06:46.100
Welcome to my command centre.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.267
Huh?

06:47.367 --> 06:49.000
Oh...

06:49.100 --> 06:52.834
this is one of my
many publications.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.534
"Reality TV."

06:54.634 --> 06:55.567
Yeah.

06:55.667 --> 06:57.200
"Satanist attack on
network television."

06:57.300 --> 07:00.300
Yeah, I know it's not
fashionable to see the
world as it is.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.033
I mean, you know, you try to
help people by simply pointing

07:02.133 --> 07:04.300
out that the country's
controlled by aliens, and the

07:04.400 --> 07:06.234
next thing you know they got
you in a straight-jacket

07:06.334 --> 07:07.701
pumped full of Thorazine.

07:07.801 --> 07:08.968
Does that happen often?

07:09.067 --> 07:11.400
Often enough.

07:11.501 --> 07:12.734
Let me tell you something.

07:12.834 --> 07:15.934
These alien freaks
actually live among us.

07:16.033 --> 07:18.834
They can make themselves look
like us, sound like us -

07:18.934 --> 07:20.534
the whole nine yards.

07:20.634 --> 07:22.667
I mean... but there are...
there are differences.

07:22.767 --> 07:24.534
I mean...

07:24.634 --> 07:26.133
far as I can tell, they
live entirely on a...

07:26.234 --> 07:29.133
on a diet of cow's
blood and battery acid.

07:29.234 --> 07:31.367
And further evidence suggests
that they are here to destroy

07:31.467 --> 07:34.000
humanity, and to mate with as
many Earth women as they can

07:34.100 --> 07:36.100
possibly get their mandibles on.

07:36.200 --> 07:36.968
Really?

07:37.067 --> 07:38.067
Yes, really.

07:38.167 --> 07:39.667
And if I were you,
I'd keep my eyes open.

07:39.767 --> 07:44.334
A babe like you is
definite anal probe bait.

07:44.434 --> 07:45.667
Okay.

07:45.767 --> 07:47.334
I think we're done here.

07:47.434 --> 07:48.267
Wait a minute.

07:48.367 --> 07:51.033
Wait... wait...
listen to me.

07:51.133 --> 07:54.334
Four years ago I was a respected
journalist working over at...

07:54.434 --> 07:56.300
The Daily Times and I was out...

07:56.400 --> 08:01.133
out in the field covering an
explosion at a gene research
company.

08:01.234 --> 08:02.567
I took this.

08:02.667 --> 08:04.334
Guy fighting with
company security.

08:04.434 --> 08:06.467
Kicked myself I wasn't
closer when I took it.

08:06.567 --> 08:08.834
But there's lightning
coming out of his hands.

08:08.934 --> 08:10.133
Lightning?

08:10.234 --> 08:14.734
Yeah, it's a common
ET phenomenon.

08:14.834 --> 08:15.701
Yeah.

08:15.801 --> 08:18.100
That photo shoulda
won me a Pulitzer.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.634
Instead, it ruined me.

08:19.734 --> 08:23.667
Cost me my career and my...

08:23.767 --> 08:27.501
cost me my family.

08:30.267 --> 08:31.567
Well, look this...

08:31.667 --> 08:33.267
there's probably something
I should tell you, Eddie.

08:33.366 --> 08:36.167
Ahem. 'Scuse us.

08:39.501 --> 08:42.467
Why do I get the feeling you're
about to tell this guy about us?

08:42.567 --> 08:44.000
What would it hurt?

08:44.100 --> 08:47.033
He'll put us in the same
box with all the other
freaks he's hunting.

08:47.133 --> 08:48.667
What use is he going
to be to us then?

08:48.767 --> 08:52.234
Shal, that picture's
of me, okay? I gotta
feel responsible for...

08:52.334 --> 08:55.200
No. Uh huh.
Don't go there.

08:55.300 --> 09:01.133
We get what
we need from this guy and we
get out, as soon as possible.

09:01.234 --> 09:03.868
Okay.

09:03.968 --> 09:07.067
<i>The confrontation at the
crash site was not expected.</i>

09:07.167 --> 09:08.667
There was someone else there.

09:08.767 --> 09:10.601
Conspiracy nut
named Eddie Boyle.

09:10.701 --> 09:12.067
He used to be a reporter.

09:12.167 --> 09:15.100
<i>There are too many
variables entering the mix,</i>

09:15.200 --> 09:16.467
<i>and too little time.</i>

09:16.567 --> 09:18.300
<i>Whatever's going to happen
will take place in the next</i>

09:18.400 --> 09:19.901
<i>twenty-four hours.</i>

09:20.000 --> 09:23.033
<i>You have to stop it.</i>

09:23.133 --> 09:24.467
Or not.

09:24.567 --> 09:25.701
<i>What are you saying?</i>

09:25.801 --> 09:28.234
I'm reassessing my
future with Mutant X.

09:28.334 --> 09:31.767
<i>This is not the time to
enter into a negotiation,
Miss Pierce.</i>

09:31.868 --> 09:34.033
I came here for one reason, and
that was to find my brother.

09:34.133 --> 09:36.267
And now that he's dead
our arrangement is over.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.000
<i>It's not that simple.</i>

09:38.100 --> 09:43.000
<i>You can't just walk away.</i>

09:43.100 --> 09:45.467
Any idea what those things were
on that plane that went down?

09:45.567 --> 09:46.868
Ah, that's the mystery.

09:46.968 --> 09:50.567
And the simple answer is that
it's all part of the conspiracy.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.501
C'mere. C'mere.

09:52.601 --> 09:55.801
See... see...
if you look at this, you begin
to see the scope of it all.

09:55.901 --> 09:58.734
The grey aliens are connected
to the Illuminati,

09:58.834 --> 10:02.234
who are connected to the Masons,
who are connected to the Royal
Family.

10:02.334 --> 10:04.167
And they're all connected to...

10:04.267 --> 10:05.934
the...

10:06.033 --> 10:08.868
this guy.

10:08.968 --> 10:10.801
Adam Kane.

10:10.901 --> 10:12.501
Adam?

10:12.601 --> 10:14.367
You've heard of him?

10:14.467 --> 10:16.000
No, I'm...

10:16.100 --> 10:18.834
I mean, you don't think one
man's behind all this, do you?

10:18.934 --> 10:21.434
Well, Kane is currently off the
radar, but the word is that

10:21.534 --> 10:23.567
he's still out there
working in the shadows.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.133
See, he used to...

10:25.234 --> 10:26.434
...used to be connected
to a... a...

10:26.534 --> 10:30.300
an outfit called Genomex,
who was hooked into the GSA.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.200
And of course, they're
all working for the...

10:33.300 --> 10:34.400
Aliens?

10:34.501 --> 10:36.767
Yes. Yes, exactly.

10:36.868 --> 10:39.000
Hey, how'd you find
out about the crash?

10:39.100 --> 10:43.000
Well, buddy of mine, Leon,
works a suppressed info website.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.734
Mainlines covert information
right from the inside.

10:46.834 --> 10:49.901
Can we meet him?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.968
Uh...

10:52.067 --> 10:53.267
Okay. All right.

10:53.367 --> 10:56.200
But anything you see or hear
while on this mission stays

10:56.300 --> 10:59.834
strictly confidential, capisce?

11:10.567 --> 11:12.734
Your friend doesn't exactly
live in the lap of luxury.

11:12.834 --> 11:17.167
Well, if you're going
to live under the radar,
you can't be picky.

11:20.701 --> 11:22.334
What?

11:22.434 --> 11:23.968
Leon's door's open.

11:24.067 --> 11:26.100
That's not like him.

11:26.200 --> 11:29.701
<whisper>
Something's wrong.
I smell blood.

11:29.801 --> 11:34.434
Oh, no.

11:34.534 --> 11:36.267
Oh, Leon.

11:36.367 --> 11:38.267
Leon?

11:38.367 --> 11:40.501
Man...

11:49.100 --> 11:51.267
Look, man, I'm sorry.

11:51.367 --> 11:52.467
Should we be calling anybody?

11:52.567 --> 11:56.000
His family, girlfriend?

11:56.100 --> 11:57.601
In our world those...

11:57.701 --> 12:00.033
that's one of the first
things you give up.

12:00.133 --> 12:04.467
The only ones who will care
are me and a couple of other
people who visited his site.

12:10.501 --> 12:11.701
Brennan?

12:11.801 --> 12:13.334
Chopper coming.

12:13.434 --> 12:14.200
Take cover, man.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.801
Whoa!

13:12.968 --> 13:16.367
Now do you
believe me?

13:18.400 --> 13:20.033
All right. Just... let
me talk to him real fast.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.934
Yeah.
Good idea.
Go on.

13:24.033 --> 13:31.367
Eddie, do you have any idea
how Leon got his information?

13:31.467 --> 13:33.167
Eddie?

13:33.267 --> 13:34.801
It... it's on his computer.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.567
I think "was" would
be the operative word.

13:36.667 --> 13:37.567
No, no, no.

13:37.667 --> 13:40.234
Leon always had
a dynamic backup.

13:40.334 --> 13:42.467
Yeah.

13:44.434 --> 13:50.300
Remember, paranoia
is your friend.

13:52.901 --> 13:56.300
Guys, I think we
have another problem.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.334
From here on in
we're walking.

13:58.434 --> 14:00.067
Not exactly.

14:00.167 --> 14:03.734
Over here.

14:08.801 --> 14:11.934
He's not gonna be
needing this any more.

14:12.033 --> 14:14.367
Let's move.

14:14.467 --> 14:16.200
Brennan, did you manage to
get anything at the trailer?

14:16.300 --> 14:18.100
Yeah, we got a backup
of Leon's hard drive.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.300
<i>Nice.</i>

14:19.400 --> 14:20.467
No, it's not so nice.

14:20.567 --> 14:22.267
None of us can figure
out a way to get into it.

14:22.367 --> 14:24.501
Well, maybe if one you guys can
distract Eddie the other one

14:24.601 --> 14:27.601
can help me set up a
back door to his system.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.767
We'll give it a shot.

14:31.434 --> 14:33.300
All right, buddy,
what's up? How's it going?

14:33.400 --> 14:38.067
Not so good. Leon got the crash
information from his contact on
a coded chat channel.

14:38.167 --> 14:40.968
Why don't you take me over here
and explain all this to me,
again?

14:41.067 --> 14:45.067
Maybe if we put our heads
together we can figure this out.

15:02.734 --> 15:04.634
<whisper> Okay,
Jess, talk me
through it.

15:04.734 --> 15:07.000
Okay.

15:07.100 --> 15:15.601
Set his browser to the IP
address 2905.190.190.65.

15:15.701 --> 15:17.133
It's a web trap I set up.

15:17.234 --> 15:18.968
Soon as his browser makes
the hit I'll have all the

15:19.067 --> 15:22.601
information I need to trace
him back to make a connection.

15:30.434 --> 15:32.634
<whisper>
Come on, Jess.
You in yet?

15:32.734 --> 15:34.968
Just a few more seconds.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.067
There, I'm in.

15:36.167 --> 15:37.434
Okay.

15:37.534 --> 15:39.400
Downloaded the image
from his hard drive.

15:39.501 --> 15:41.734
See what I can find
and get back to you.

15:46.968 --> 15:48.367
You guys figure anything out.

15:48.467 --> 15:51.434
Yeah, Eddie may have
known someone that Leon
was talking to.

15:51.534 --> 15:54.067
Yeah, this guy'll
definitely convince you if
nothing else does.

15:54.167 --> 15:56.734
He's the king of
conspiracy theorists.

15:56.834 --> 15:59.000
Let's see if we can
arrange an audience.

16:00.567 --> 16:03.133
He works out of
an old age home?

16:03.234 --> 16:04.501
<i>Get away.</i>

16:04.601 --> 16:06.701
<i>Give me this thing,
will you.</i>

16:06.801 --> 16:08.033
<i>Get out now...</i>

16:08.133 --> 16:10.133
Yo, Silver... Silver...
Silver... Silver, hey...

16:10.234 --> 16:11.501
Oh, hey, Eddie, how ya doing?

16:11.601 --> 16:13.067
Oh, good. Good. How you doing?

16:13.167 --> 16:16.434
Okay. Will you excuse
us? I have company.

16:16.534 --> 16:19.200
Told you he was a hard ass.

16:20.334 --> 16:22.033
Hey, I brought
some... some friends.

16:22.133 --> 16:23.434
Do you mind if I talk
to you for a minute?

16:23.534 --> 16:24.467
No, that's okay.

16:24.567 --> 16:25.868
I...

16:25.968 --> 16:28.434
I'm sorry about Leon, you know?

16:28.534 --> 16:31.000
But he was a damn fool.

16:31.100 --> 16:36.734
That website was, like, an
invitation for them to...

16:36.834 --> 16:38.033
to smoke him, you know?

16:38.133 --> 16:39.400
I know.

16:39.501 --> 16:40.734
I know.

16:40.834 --> 16:44.234
Silver, the last chat that
you had with Leon, was there

16:44.334 --> 16:45.567
anything strange about it?

16:45.667 --> 16:47.133
Uh, not so you'd notice.

16:47.234 --> 16:48.801
Yeah, well, what we need
to know is how he got the

16:48.901 --> 16:50.467
information about the plane.

16:50.567 --> 16:57.100
He said he was in direct contact
with somebody who had been to
Area 12.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.734
Of course.

16:58.834 --> 16:59.901
<i>Of course!</i>

17:00.000 --> 17:00.901
I...

17:01.000 --> 17:03.033
it's sitting right
in front of my face.

17:03.133 --> 17:05.200
Area 12?

17:05.300 --> 17:06.434
Are...

17:06.534 --> 17:09.067
are you sure these
people are searchers?

17:09.166 --> 17:10.133
Yes.

17:10.233 --> 17:12.300
It's like, Area 51,
but on the northeast.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.800
Army has a couple of
alien ships there.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.601
Yeah, the place is
lousy with aliens.

17:16.701 --> 17:17.800
I've seen them myself.

17:17.901 --> 17:20.133
Yes.

17:20.233 --> 17:22.133
<i><Brennan, you there? ></i>

17:22.233 --> 17:23.601
'Scuse me, guys, for a sec.

17:23.701 --> 17:25.601
Yeah.

17:25.701 --> 17:29.734
Oh, yeah, you two
together, or what?

17:33.634 --> 17:35.067
What's up, Jess?

17:35.167 --> 17:36.434
Okay.

17:36.534 --> 17:38.300
Turns out that the IP
address of the guy Leon was

17:38.400 --> 17:39.767
communicating with
was government.

17:39.868 --> 17:41.067
He's gotta be high up.

17:41.167 --> 17:44.267
There's no listing as to
who the address belongs to.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.300
He was communicating with
someone on the inside.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.734
Yeah, it looks that way.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.434
I'm tracking the address on the
'Net, see if I can at least

17:49.534 --> 17:52.934
find out where Leon's
source is located.

17:53.033 --> 17:55.501
Try Area 12.

18:02.367 --> 18:05.501
We have less than
twelve hours to avert some
kind of major disaster.

18:05.601 --> 18:10.133
And we're visiting
UFO bases on the advice of some
old fart in bedroom slippers.

18:10.234 --> 18:12.601
What's your point?

18:12.701 --> 18:16.601
Look, you
feel bad about Eddie losing his
job and his family - me, too.

18:16.701 --> 18:18.868
But find some other way to
deal with your guilt, okay?

18:18.968 --> 18:20.701
Take him out for a few beers,
help him meet some chicks.

18:20.801 --> 18:22.901
But don't let him waste
any more of our time.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.501
Shal, Jess just traced Leon's
source back to a government IP
address.

18:27.601 --> 18:28.767
This is going somewhere.

18:28.868 --> 18:31.567
I believe him.

18:31.667 --> 18:33.133
Guys ready to go?

18:33.234 --> 18:35.634
Let's go.

18:35.734 --> 18:38.200
Let's go.

18:45.334 --> 18:47.634
Running away is not going
to make things any better.

18:47.734 --> 18:52.000
No? Well, I wouldn't have to put
up with people getting involved
in my affairs.

18:52.100 --> 18:55.801
Lexa, working as a mercenary
before didn't make you happy,
did it?

18:55.901 --> 18:59.334
It's not going to be any better
now if you go back to it.

18:59.434 --> 19:01.534
But I know that there have been
times here when you've been one

19:01.634 --> 19:03.367
of us, and that
has made you happy.

19:03.467 --> 19:05.801
This is not what I want, Jess.

19:05.901 --> 19:09.000
I don't belong here, okay?

19:12.067 --> 19:17.400
So where do you belong?

19:30.534 --> 19:33.267
Oh, yeah, baby.
This is the place.

19:33.367 --> 19:35.701
Yeah, check it out.
Area 12.

19:35.801 --> 19:39.200
This is gotta be where
that flight was headed.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.801
And those are the
shooters from the plane.

19:41.901 --> 19:43.701
What do you think, Shal?

19:43.801 --> 19:44.901
Nice suits.

19:45.033 --> 19:47.968
<laughs>

19:52.467 --> 19:53.701
Hold it.

19:53.801 --> 19:57.467
What the hell is that?

20:04.701 --> 20:06.100
It's a good bet whatever's in
the back of that truck has

20:06.200 --> 20:09.601
nothing to do with ice cream.

20:26.534 --> 20:27.834
Here he comes.

20:27.934 --> 20:30.634
Yeah, got that.

20:37.434 --> 20:39.234
<arguing>
I don't believe this.

20:39.334 --> 20:40.801
Who shops out here?

20:40.901 --> 20:42.901
Hey, you know what? I realize
you're allergic to maps.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.234
Would it have
killed you to ask...

20:44.334 --> 20:46.300
There's not even any retail
outlet stores out here.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.267
What's going on here?

20:48.367 --> 20:49.767
Thank goodness you came by.

20:49.868 --> 20:51.701
I told you shoulda checked
the radiator before we left
the station.

20:51.801 --> 20:53.901
What are you talking about?
I checked it this weekend -
it was fine.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.067
Well, that's great. If it was
still the weekend then we
wouldn't have a

20:56.167 --> 20:58.133
problem, now, would we?

20:58.234 --> 20:59.567
Just get your car off the road.

20:59.667 --> 21:00.634
All right...

21:00.734 --> 21:02.767
Champ, this car's
not going anywhere.

21:02.868 --> 21:04.167
Push it.

21:12.901 --> 21:14.100
You're going to give
us a ride back...

21:14.200 --> 21:16.734
Get your car off the road.

21:16.834 --> 21:19.467
Buddy, it's a twenty-mile
hike back into town.

21:19.567 --> 21:22.100
She's got corns.

21:26.901 --> 21:29.934
I won't ask you again.

21:30.033 --> 21:31.868
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:31.968 --> 21:34.934
Chill out. Okay? All you
had to do was ask.

21:35.033 --> 21:36.033
Right here. Push, push.

21:36.133 --> 21:40.634
Push. Push, push, push.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.100
Now would be a
good time, Brennan.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.000
Push!

21:45.100 --> 21:46.634
Push!

21:46.734 --> 21:50.400
A little help would be nice.

21:50.934 --> 21:51.834
Ugghh!

21:51.934 --> 21:54.267
Come on!

21:55.634 --> 21:58.400
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:01.400 --> 22:04.133
Yeah, thanks a lot there, pally!

22:05.934 --> 22:08.801
Brennan!

22:12.968 --> 22:14.200
Well, Eddie.

22:14.300 --> 22:17.133
I found your alien.

22:22.868 --> 22:25.434
Whoo... whoo... whoo...

22:25.534 --> 22:26.901
I don't believe it.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.200
I spend a lifetime trying to
take a decent photo of an alien

22:30.300 --> 22:33.100
- now I finally got
one in the flesh.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.200
Whatever it is they're made of.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.100
I can't believe I'm
going to say this.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.033
I actually think you might
be on to something here.

22:39.133 --> 22:40.334
Okay. All right. Okay.

22:40.434 --> 22:42.434
The first thing that we're
going to do is we are going to

22:42.534 --> 22:45.834
drive this baby right up to the
front doors of The Daily Times.

22:45.934 --> 22:47.467
And I am going to rub
their noses in it.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.701
Eddie. Listen. I got a
better idea, man.

22:49.801 --> 22:51.267
We're gonna drop this off with
a friend of mine who knows

22:51.367 --> 22:52.367
about this kind of stuff.

22:52.467 --> 22:54.000
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:54.100 --> 22:55.300
Come on, what are
you talking about?

22:55.400 --> 22:57.200
A friend? What...
what... what do you mean?

22:57.300 --> 22:59.200
Friend? I don't under...
I don't understand.

22:59.300 --> 23:00.167
Before you didn't...

23:00.267 --> 23:01.501
you didn't know
anyone, or anything.

23:01.601 --> 23:02.734
I mean, I...

23:02.834 --> 23:05.400
how come you're so
connected all of a sudden?

23:05.501 --> 23:07.834
Just trust me. Okay?

23:07.934 --> 23:09.501
He's a specialist, all right?

23:09.601 --> 23:11.734
You're going to expose these
things to the world, don't you

23:11.834 --> 23:16.033
think you should at least know
what it is that you're exposing?

23:20.734 --> 23:23.133
Okay, Brennan.

23:23.234 --> 23:25.234
I'm going to trust you.

23:25.334 --> 23:29.167
Just don't let me down.

23:29.267 --> 23:30.367
Please.

23:30.467 --> 23:32.367
I won't.

23:35.334 --> 23:38.534
Okay. We got an alien.
Let's go.

23:38.634 --> 23:41.100
Whoo!

23:43.601 --> 23:44.801
Jess, you still with us?

23:44.901 --> 23:47.267
Yeah. Brennan, bring the body
down to Dr. Marx's clinic.

23:47.367 --> 23:48.167
I'll meet you there.

23:48.267 --> 23:49.234
All right.

23:49.334 --> 23:50.868
Get Lexa's people
to get us some IDs.

23:50.968 --> 23:52.167
All right?

23:52.267 --> 23:53.868
FBI, CIA, whatever.

23:53.968 --> 23:56.400
All right. I'm on it.

23:58.267 --> 24:01.200
It's a good thing you
didn't open the suit.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.200
Yeah.

24:02.300 --> 24:04.067
Uh, Doc, those guys
were already dead.

24:04.167 --> 24:05.934
I don't think there's much
more that can happen to 'em.

24:06.033 --> 24:08.767
Not to them. To you.

24:08.868 --> 24:11.234
See, these suits weren't
designed to keep stuff out.

24:11.334 --> 24:13.767
They were designed to keep
something really nasty in.

24:13.868 --> 24:16.000
They're kind of a...

24:16.100 --> 24:17.834
reverse biohazard suit.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.767
Do you have any idea what it
is that they're keeping in?

24:19.868 --> 24:21.734
Yeah, well, not aliens, if
that's what you're thinking.

24:21.834 --> 24:24.434
What are you talking about?
That... that thing is
definitely an alien.

24:24.534 --> 24:28.667
The samples show that his
genetic structure has been
modified.

24:28.767 --> 24:35.501
Well... but... what are you
talking about? Like, some
kind of mutant or something?

24:35.601 --> 24:38.133
Well, whatever
they did to him...

24:38.234 --> 24:41.267
caused him to grow an extra
organ close to his spleen,

24:41.367 --> 24:44.968
the sole purpose of which
seems to be the manufacture
of disease.

24:45.100 --> 24:46.367
He's a disease factory.

24:46.467 --> 24:48.167
In a sense, yeah.

24:48.267 --> 24:50.167
Now the bacteria they create
are designed to travel a direct

24:50.267 --> 24:52.534
route through the lymphatic
system and out through special

24:52.634 --> 24:54.434
conduits in the hand.

24:54.534 --> 24:57.868
I think that they're able to
transmit the disease
selectively.

24:57.968 --> 24:59.534
You have a handle
on the bacteria?

24:59.634 --> 25:00.968
Oh, they're lethal.

25:01.067 --> 25:04.400
From what I can tell,
they'll kill in... a minute?

25:04.501 --> 25:06.601
And the thing is, as fast
as they kill they die off.

25:06.701 --> 25:08.200
So by the time they have a
chance to do an autopsy, the

25:08.300 --> 25:10.534
bacteria would be
virtually undetectable.

25:10.634 --> 25:14.901
If they
manage to perfect this process
there's no stopping them.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.467
It's the ultimate
assassin, really.

25:16.567 --> 25:17.467
Yeah.

25:17.567 --> 25:19.200
Tag someone in a
crowd, and then...

25:19.300 --> 25:20.667
disappear.

25:20.767 --> 25:22.734
What happened to this
guy we brought in?

25:22.834 --> 25:24.367
Well, that's a good question.

25:24.467 --> 25:26.434
You see, he's designed to be
immune to his own bacteria, but

25:26.534 --> 25:27.767
it didn't work.

25:27.868 --> 25:30.467
So, in a sense he, and the
other guy that you saw in the

25:30.567 --> 25:32.934
truck, are failures.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.267
There's a third one.

25:34.367 --> 25:36.267
What?
- What?

25:36.367 --> 25:38.968
Yeah. Yeah, there's a
third suit in the truck.

25:39.067 --> 25:43.467
Which means there is another one
out there alive, ready to kill.

25:43.567 --> 25:45.801
Look, is there a way to
counteract the bacteria?

25:45.901 --> 25:47.334
Well, I'd have to bring
some specialists in.

25:47.434 --> 25:50.200
It'd take a couple of more hours
to run a more complete analysis.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.400
Okay. Uh uh. I don't think so.

25:52.501 --> 25:55.234
I'm sorry, but this baby's got
a date with the national media.

25:55.334 --> 25:58.501
I am leaving with it.

25:58.601 --> 26:02.000
Let me talk to you for a second.

26:02.100 --> 26:03.334
Let me tell you something.

26:03.434 --> 26:05.901
I waited four years for this
opportunity, and you promised.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.701
I'm not going to let some
crackpot take my shot.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.267
Eddie.

26:10.367 --> 26:11.601
It's not an alien.

26:11.701 --> 26:13.601
Well, that doesn't mean they
weren't created by aliens.

26:13.701 --> 26:17.467
You know, they send them
into our midst, wipe out
all resistance.

26:17.567 --> 26:19.567
And you know what? While we're
at it, I'd like...

26:19.667 --> 26:21.400
I want to know who
you people are.

26:21.501 --> 26:24.767
Random abductees don't
usually know doctors
with secret genetic labs.

26:24.868 --> 26:27.901
All right?

26:29.701 --> 26:30.968
All right, Eddie.

26:31.067 --> 26:32.968
I guess we've kept this
from you long enough.

26:33.067 --> 26:34.968
We're FBI.

26:35.067 --> 26:38.901
Branch 17.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.834
I knew it existed.

26:42.934 --> 26:47.033
Well, just... so... you...
you guys are like the real X
Files, right?

26:47.133 --> 26:48.100
Heh... Right?

26:48.200 --> 26:50.601
You're part of the
team, now, man.

26:50.701 --> 26:51.634
Okay.

26:51.734 --> 26:53.133
Okay, great. Well, what...

26:53.234 --> 26:55.434
what's the deal? I mean, you
gotta know something.

26:55.534 --> 26:57.868
Yeah, we don't know anything
more about this than you do.

26:57.968 --> 26:59.234
Well...

26:59.334 --> 27:01.367
But we know that there's a
major catastrophe that we need

27:01.467 --> 27:03.734
to stop in about three hours.

27:03.834 --> 27:05.534
So are you down for
helping us out, or what?

27:05.634 --> 27:10.267
What?
Are you kidding me? Wild horses
couldn't drag me off this story.

27:10.367 --> 27:12.667
Ugh...

27:15.934 --> 27:20.067
We found out who leaked the
information about the crash.

27:20.167 --> 27:21.133
Dr. Harrow.

27:21.234 --> 27:23.767
Ow...

27:23.868 --> 27:24.901
I'm surprised.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.701
Weren't we... generous enough?

27:26.801 --> 27:28.701
Money had nothing to do with it.

27:28.801 --> 27:31.434
I learned how you
planned to use them.

27:31.534 --> 27:33.300
Killing our country's enemies.

27:33.400 --> 27:35.067
It's a... noble cause.

27:35.167 --> 27:41.200
My issue is with you deciding
who the enemies are.

27:41.300 --> 27:46.868
Yes, well, now you're
one of those enemies.

27:53.834 --> 27:57.334
No...!

27:57.434 --> 28:02.934
Ugh...

28:05.834 --> 28:08.300
Thank you, Doctor.

28:08.400 --> 28:12.601
Your death will not be in vain.

28:12.701 --> 28:14.734
Unless the people who stole
the other subjects are idiots

28:14.834 --> 28:16.234
they will have analyzed
them by now.

28:16.334 --> 28:18.067
All lines of communication
are being monitored.

28:18.167 --> 28:19.467
We'll find them.

28:19.567 --> 28:22.467
What's important now is the
next phase of the operation.

28:22.567 --> 28:26.634
We have a schedule to stick to.

28:26.734 --> 28:32.100
Let's see if you're as effective
as the good doctor intended.

28:43.734 --> 28:45.200
I didn't know if you'd come.

28:45.300 --> 28:47.734
You have information?

28:47.834 --> 28:50.834
Jesse Kilmartin's analysis of
the body they found confirms he

28:50.934 --> 28:54.901
was one of the subjects in a
secret military project
called "Contact".

28:55.000 --> 28:58.734
It's purpose was to create a
subspecies bred for
assassination.

28:58.834 --> 29:01.334
It was discontinued
over a year ago.

29:01.434 --> 29:04.300
Seems pretty healthy for
a discontinued project.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.968
Do you have any idea
who's running this?

29:06.067 --> 29:09.567
Before termination, it had
been led by Dr. Robert Harrow.

29:09.667 --> 29:11.968
Unfortunately, he was found
dead on a downtown street

29:12.100 --> 29:13.767
thirty minutes ago.

29:13.868 --> 29:17.334
Intel suggests
he was killed by one of the
"Project Contact" assassins.

29:17.434 --> 29:19.133
Do you have anyone
else connected?

29:19.234 --> 29:21.100
There is no record of the
project continuing under any

29:21.200 --> 29:22.868
government sanction.

29:22.968 --> 29:26.968
But we're looking into anyone
who might've known about it at
the time.

29:27.067 --> 29:29.367
You didn't call me down here
for information you could've

29:29.467 --> 29:31.667
given me over the phone.

29:31.767 --> 29:33.834
I need to know your answer.

29:33.934 --> 29:35.667
About leaving Mutant X.

29:35.767 --> 29:36.868
I haven't decided yet.

29:36.968 --> 29:38.267
Decide.

29:38.367 --> 29:40.734
My Council is worried that if
you're not working with us, you

29:40.834 --> 29:43.200
may be working against us.

29:43.300 --> 29:44.701
You're powerful, Lexa.

29:44.801 --> 29:48.834
But there are people with power
even you should be afraid of.

29:48.934 --> 29:51.534
You must choose which
side you're working for.

29:51.634 --> 29:55.067
Well, you'll be
the first to know.

29:58.968 --> 30:00.167
Grrr...

30:00.267 --> 30:02.667
This is not making
any sense yet.

30:02.767 --> 30:05.267
I mean, these guys
creating killers, I get.

30:05.367 --> 30:09.667
I just don't see how it fits
into the whole conspiracy web.

30:09.767 --> 30:11.267
Eddie.

30:11.367 --> 30:13.067
Don't you ever miss it?

30:13.167 --> 30:14.267
What?

30:14.367 --> 30:15.868
Living a normal life,
like other people?

30:15.968 --> 30:17.801
Other people are blind, Brennan.

30:17.901 --> 30:20.267
So you don't ever think that
you should give this up -

30:20.367 --> 30:21.634
conspiracies, aliens?

30:21.734 --> 30:23.834
You mean close my
eyes to the truth?

30:23.934 --> 30:26.100
No. No, just... I don't...

30:26.200 --> 30:28.067
not see so much of it.

30:28.167 --> 30:30.367
Why do you feel so responsible
for figuring everything out for
other people?

30:30.467 --> 30:34.200
Brennan! This
is what I do. Okay?

30:34.300 --> 30:37.434
Don't you think you've
given up enough?

30:37.534 --> 30:38.501
Maybe too much?

30:38.601 --> 30:40.033
Ohh...

30:40.133 --> 30:43.000
don't you think I know that?

30:43.100 --> 30:44.300
I know people think I'm nuts.

30:44.400 --> 30:49.200
But I am a good
journalist, okay?

30:49.300 --> 30:51.033
So all this started when you
took a picture of that guy with

30:51.133 --> 30:52.901
lightning coming
out of his hands?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.200
Yeah.

30:54.300 --> 30:55.934
What if somebody told you
what that was all about?

30:56.033 --> 30:57.200
Would you be able
to let it go then?

30:57.300 --> 31:01.167
There's no letting go, okay?

31:01.267 --> 31:03.267
Let me tell you something, that
story'll be my ticket back.

31:03.367 --> 31:05.167
If I could ever get my hands on
that freak, I'll have him in

31:05.267 --> 31:06.767
every paper from
here to Beijing.

31:06.868 --> 31:09.133
What...? Do you know something?

31:09.234 --> 31:11.167
No.

31:11.267 --> 31:13.968
Just wondering.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.100
Just got an update from Lexa.

31:18.200 --> 31:21.334
She says those things we found
were from something called
"Project Contact".

31:21.434 --> 31:23.868
Project Contact.

31:23.968 --> 31:27.567
Project Contact.

31:27.667 --> 31:29.467
Okay. I got it. Uh...

31:29.567 --> 31:30.667
Military.

31:30.767 --> 31:32.100
Deep cover.

31:32.200 --> 31:35.033
It was shut down after pressure
from the Senator from the State.

31:35.133 --> 31:37.801
Guy named Danny Richards?

31:37.901 --> 31:39.234
And...

31:39.334 --> 31:42.300
Uh, he's currently running
a commission on policing
the abuse...

31:42.400 --> 31:44.200
of genetic military research.

31:44.300 --> 31:47.100
Sounds like a natural enemy of
whoever created Project Contact.

31:47.200 --> 31:50.801
He also sounds like someone who
could tell us who that was.

31:53.567 --> 31:56.400
Jenny, get me Senator Klein.

31:58.300 --> 32:00.167
Thank you.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.868
I didn't see you come in.

32:03.968 --> 32:07.434
I wanted to be a little
early for the briefing.

32:07.534 --> 32:10.100
Daniel, I feel obliged to warn
you about the position you're

32:10.200 --> 32:12.133
taking in this report tonight.

32:12.234 --> 32:13.567
You know, there
have been threats.

32:13.667 --> 32:15.501
I appreciate your concern, Nick.

32:15.601 --> 32:19.167
But I'm not going to
allow genetic weapons
research to continue.

32:19.267 --> 32:20.334
It's ending.

32:20.434 --> 32:22.033
Here and now.

32:22.133 --> 32:26.434
I truly believe this is
one of the most important
issues in the country.

32:26.534 --> 32:27.667
Well, I agree.

32:27.767 --> 32:29.067
In fact, I...

32:29.167 --> 32:34.100
I think it's fair to say that
it's a matter of life and death.

32:43.968 --> 32:45.167
All right.
What'd you find out?

32:45.267 --> 32:46.701
Well, he's a real crusader.

32:46.801 --> 32:49.067
He shut down Project Contact
and ten other genetic-based

32:49.167 --> 32:50.868
weapons research projects.

32:50.968 --> 32:53.334
There are a lot of people
siphoning money from those
projects, Brennan.

32:53.434 --> 32:55.467
Word is he's got more enemies
than friends right now.

32:55.567 --> 32:57.334
Well, how far these
enemies are willing to go?

32:57.434 --> 32:58.834
It's a good question.

32:58.934 --> 33:00.767
He's scheduled to deliver a
report on the commission he

33:00.868 --> 33:02.701
chaired later tonight.

33:02.801 --> 33:04.100
Yeah, let me guess
- eight o'clock.

33:04.200 --> 33:05.501
<i>Bingo!</i>

33:05.601 --> 33:07.734
Hey, look, inside sources say
he's announcing a total freeze

33:07.834 --> 33:09.701
on gene-based weapons.

33:09.801 --> 33:11.634
He's also commenced an
investigation of suspected

33:11.734 --> 33:14.701
genetic crimes committed
by military companies.

33:14.801 --> 33:15.901
Yeah.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.801
So his murder is a disaster.

33:17.901 --> 33:19.067
We have to warn him.

33:19.167 --> 33:21.601
No. No, no, no - look. We
don't have any proof.

33:21.701 --> 33:23.501
Okay? We don't know
who's behind it.

33:23.601 --> 33:25.234
And we can't even tell
him who we really are.

33:25.334 --> 33:28.467
Jess, if we don't then he's
a dead man. All right?

33:28.567 --> 33:30.000
If he's the one that shut down
Project Contact, then maybe

33:30.100 --> 33:32.767
he'd be able to fill
in some blanks for us.

33:32.868 --> 33:36.367
All right,
Lex, you think the Dominion
can give him a heads up?

33:36.467 --> 33:38.234
Let's just assume we're
on our own on this one.

33:38.334 --> 33:40.801
Do you know where Richards
is delivering the report?

33:40.901 --> 33:43.234
Uh, the Federal
Building on Fairmount.

33:43.334 --> 33:44.801
If something's going to happen
to Richards, then we're gonna

33:44.901 --> 33:46.300
need all hands on deck.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.901
Think you guys can make
it there in an hour?

33:48.000 --> 33:49.934
We're on the move.

33:50.033 --> 33:51.167
I'm not coming with you.

33:51.267 --> 33:53.601
What?

33:56.167 --> 33:57.400
What?

33:57.501 --> 33:59.901
We're different, Jess.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.767
You know, when I was a kid, the
only thing I ever thought about

34:02.868 --> 34:05.234
was taking care of my brother.

34:05.334 --> 34:12.534
Everything I did for
Eckhart, Adam, the Dominion,
was all about saving Leo.

34:12.634 --> 34:13.868
And I screwed it up.

34:13.967 --> 34:14.701
No.

34:14.801 --> 34:16.100
I didn't save anything.

34:16.199 --> 34:17.266
You did what you could do.

34:17.367 --> 34:19.801
Yeah, and I failed.

34:19.900 --> 34:21.167
You don't need me.

34:21.266 --> 34:23.400
I mean, the last person who
counted on me ended up dead.

34:23.501 --> 34:24.934
Is that what this is about?

34:25.033 --> 34:26.067
Are you worried about us?

34:26.167 --> 34:28.701
No, I don't know how I feel.

34:28.801 --> 34:32.833
I just know I need to get
away and figure things out.

34:32.934 --> 34:36.601
Look, when I first came
here I was messed up, too.

34:36.701 --> 34:39.067
The last thing I
thought I wanted was...

34:39.167 --> 34:41.067
join a bunch of
freaks in a cave.

34:41.167 --> 34:42.266
But...

34:42.367 --> 34:44.967
Lexa, once I was in, I found
something that I could

34:45.067 --> 34:46.434
never find on the outside.

34:46.534 --> 34:50.333
For the first time
in my life I fit in.

34:50.434 --> 34:55.300
You're a part of that now.

34:55.400 --> 34:59.367
You need to go.

35:10.167 --> 35:12.200
<door opens>

35:12.300 --> 35:14.033
Excuse me, how did
you get in here?

35:14.133 --> 35:15.467
Senator, we need to talk to you.

35:15.567 --> 35:16.601
That door was locked.

35:16.701 --> 35:18.300
It was.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.100
That security button
won't work either.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.400
Senator, you need
to listen to us.

35:21.501 --> 35:23.467
This is very important.

35:23.567 --> 35:24.968
What do you want?

35:25.067 --> 35:26.734
About a year ago you pulled
funding on a government

35:26.834 --> 35:29.634
research operation
called Project Contact.

35:29.734 --> 35:32.133
Details of that research
were never public knowledge.

35:32.234 --> 35:34.000
Well, before too long the
impacts of your actions are

35:34.100 --> 35:36.767
going to be felt up
close and personal.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.067
What are you talking about?

35:38.167 --> 35:40.234
Someone secretly continued
funding that project.

35:40.334 --> 35:43.334
They were successful in creating
one of the touch killers.

35:43.434 --> 35:44.968
How do you know this?

35:45.067 --> 35:46.234
Well, it's a long story.

35:46.334 --> 35:48.133
What's important here is
that your life is in danger.

35:48.234 --> 35:49.901
I'm not going to
put off my report.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.133
That's not what we're asking.

35:51.234 --> 35:53.234
We just want to be added
to your security detail.

35:53.334 --> 35:54.801
You know what that
project is all about.

35:54.901 --> 35:57.734
The killer could be
anyone in that room.

35:57.834 --> 35:59.100
Who could've done this?

35:59.200 --> 36:00.667
Oh, that's where it
gets interesting.

36:00.767 --> 36:03.167
See, the way we figure it, it's
Adam Kane, working with the New

36:03.267 --> 36:04.601
World Order and the Masons.

36:04.701 --> 36:05.701
Eddie!

36:05.801 --> 36:07.767
Because they're all
working for the aliens!

36:07.868 --> 36:09.234
I want you out of here.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.501
Senator...

36:10.601 --> 36:12.167
Senator, listen, what we're
telling you is the truth.

36:12.267 --> 36:13.734
You don't believe us, then
check with your own sources.

36:13.834 --> 36:16.100
Security, there's been a break
into the Committee Room.

36:16.200 --> 36:19.267
Tell Mr. Benedict
to get down here.

36:19.367 --> 36:20.167
I think that went well.

36:20.267 --> 36:21.534
What is wrong with you?

36:21.634 --> 36:23.067
What are you talking about?
The plan was to warn him, right?

36:23.167 --> 36:24.767
Yes or no?

36:24.868 --> 36:26.400
Are you going to
tell him or am I?

36:26.501 --> 36:27.634
Eddie, come here.

36:27.734 --> 36:28.767
Come here.

36:28.868 --> 36:30.167
Tell... tell me what?

36:30.267 --> 36:31.667
Eddie, I'm sorry, but we're
going to have to ask you to

36:31.767 --> 36:34.200
take a step back on this one.

36:34.300 --> 36:36.501
What do mean, like,
as in go away?

36:36.601 --> 36:38.000
Look, if somebody's going to
make a move on Richards, we

36:38.100 --> 36:40.367
need to know that there
are no wild cards.

36:40.467 --> 36:42.167
So now I'm a wild card?

36:42.267 --> 36:45.167
Come on, Brennan, what...
you said we were going to
work on this together, right?

36:45.267 --> 36:46.267
Brennan...?

36:46.367 --> 36:48.567
Come on, Eddie.

36:51.634 --> 36:55.367
I know I shouldn't
have trusted you.

36:58.868 --> 37:02.234
Excuse me.

37:20.367 --> 37:23.000
Sir, what's going on?

37:23.100 --> 37:27.834
Agh...

37:27.934 --> 37:34.400
agh...

37:34.501 --> 37:38.033
agh...!

38:11.167 --> 38:12.501
Where's Lexa?

38:12.601 --> 38:13.767
She couldn't make it.

38:13.868 --> 38:14.934
What?

38:15.033 --> 38:16.300
Long story.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.868
Um, Brennan, it's going to
be tough to keep our eyes

38:17.968 --> 38:19.634
everywhere at one time, huh?

38:19.734 --> 38:24.367
Yeah. Look, Senator's their
target, so anyone who gets
too close to him is our guy.

38:24.467 --> 38:26.133
Looks like his own security's
got him pretty covered.

38:26.234 --> 38:28.968
Yeah, well, I don't think normal
security's going to be much help
here.

38:29.067 --> 38:30.701
Look, you guys take the
west side over here.

38:30.801 --> 38:33.601
I'm gonna cover the door.

38:33.701 --> 38:36.334
<loud whisper> Brennan!
Brennan! Brennan!

38:36.434 --> 38:37.901
Brennan, this is getting weird.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.100
What are you doing?

38:39.200 --> 38:40.033
I told you you had to
let us handle this.

38:40.133 --> 38:41.367
No, no, no.
I saw this guy...

38:41.467 --> 38:43.367
You need to get this through
your head: This is not about

38:43.467 --> 38:46.467
Elvis or Masons or aliens.

38:46.567 --> 38:48.334
There's a very important
person in danger here.

38:48.434 --> 38:49.300
I know that.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.601
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

38:50.701 --> 38:52.834
It's somebody on the Senator's
team that's one of them.

38:52.934 --> 38:53.834
One of who?

38:53.934 --> 38:55.634
Them! A guy named Benedict.

38:55.734 --> 38:58.868
He's a... a one of the head
honchos on Project Contact.

38:58.968 --> 39:01.968
Big time fixer, connected to
about ten groups that I've been
tracking.

39:02.067 --> 39:03.834
No, I got the proof, Brennan.

39:03.934 --> 39:06.634
You gotta trust me.

39:06.734 --> 39:08.300
Senator's about to arrive.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.567
Get him outta here.

39:10.667 --> 39:13.501
Brennan...?

39:13.601 --> 39:16.934
Eddie, I'm sorry.
You gotta go.

39:17.033 --> 39:18.634
Hey, you know what?

39:18.734 --> 39:20.167
Fine.

39:20.267 --> 39:21.667
I'm on my own anyway.

39:21.767 --> 39:25.300
Like always.

39:29.834 --> 39:33.501
Dammit!

39:33.601 --> 39:35.434
Tomorrow morning, every paper
in the country will carry the

39:35.534 --> 39:38.601
results of the report.

39:38.701 --> 39:40.567
I'm sure they will.

39:40.667 --> 39:46.767
Agent, could you escort the
Senator to the conference,
please?

39:48.400 --> 39:49.367
Senator!

39:49.467 --> 39:51.067
Benedict is part
of Project Contact.

39:51.167 --> 39:52.367
He's trying to stop you.

39:52.467 --> 39:53.868
He's crazy.
Senator...

39:53.968 --> 39:55.133
No!

39:55.234 --> 39:58.400
Ugh...

39:58.501 --> 40:00.300
Eddie!

40:09.067 --> 40:11.467
It was Benedict!
Stop him!

40:15.100 --> 40:17.033
Brennan!

40:23.567 --> 40:25.734
Sorry I'm late.

40:29.100 --> 40:31.334
Brennan.

40:31.434 --> 40:35.100
I been searching for
the truth for so long.

40:35.200 --> 40:38.100
I guess I'm gonna go
without ever knowing.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.100
No.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.367
Look, Eddie...

40:40.467 --> 40:41.901
Iook at me.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.334
There are aliens.

40:44.434 --> 40:48.133
We've been here all along.

40:48.234 --> 40:49.868
Oh...

40:56.667 --> 41:01.133
We're your friends.

41:13.167 --> 41:16.634
Hey, read the news today?

41:16.734 --> 41:17.901
Why?
Anything interesting?

41:18.000 --> 41:21.200
Well, there's a whole
article on Eddie.

41:21.300 --> 41:24.834
How he managed to expose
Project Contact and Benedict.

41:24.934 --> 41:27.400
Make him out to be quite a hero.

41:27.501 --> 41:28.934
He was.

41:29.033 --> 41:30.667
Any idea how he got the story?

41:30.767 --> 41:33.801
I'm sure a guy like Eddie has
a friend or two somewhere.

41:33.901 --> 41:37.567
Well, whoever did it,
they did the right thing.

41:37.667 --> 41:39.534
He deserved it.

41:39.634 --> 41:42.734
He actually deserved
a lot more than that. Right?

41:42.834 --> 41:46.200
Yeah.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.033
It's a good thing you
turned up back there

41:48.133 --> 41:51.767
Hey, well, you know how
I hate to miss a party.

41:51.868 --> 41:54.567
This mean you'll
be staying around?

41:54.667 --> 41:56.167
I don't know.

41:56.267 --> 42:00.434
Just don't rent out
my room yet, okay?

42:00.534 --> 42:02.734
Yeah.
