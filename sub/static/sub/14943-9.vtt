WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.002
(People shouting indistinctly)

00:03.003 --> 00:03.774
(Woman) We're here for
the second week of testimony

00:03.775 --> 00:05.305
in the trial of Gerry Roberts,

00:05.306 --> 00:07.477
the Philadelphia
investment fund manager

00:07.478 --> 00:10.710
accused of bilking his
clients out of nearly $1 billion.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.312
Investigators believe

00:12.313 --> 00:15.085
that the bulk of that money
has been laundered overseas,

00:15.086 --> 00:17.087
but they have not
yet been able to find it.

00:17.088 --> 00:19.449
Meanwhile, security has been
tightened here at the courthouse

00:19.450 --> 00:22.152
in the wake of multiple
death threats being made

00:22.153 --> 00:24.154
against Mr. Roberts.

00:24.155 --> 00:26.556
Live from the courthouse
steps, I'm Diane mizota.

00:26.557 --> 00:28.027
Back to you in the studio.

00:28.028 --> 00:28.799
Just to be clear,

00:28.800 --> 00:30.760
you never stole any money.

00:30.761 --> 00:33.163
You never guaranteed
any investor

00:33.164 --> 00:36.406
a specific return
on their money.

00:36.407 --> 00:39.109
There are no
guarantees in investing.

00:39.110 --> 00:40.310
I didn't steal their money.

00:40.311 --> 00:41.811
The market turned.

00:41.812 --> 00:43.473
It goes with the territory.

00:43.474 --> 00:44.774
Thank you.

00:44.775 --> 00:48.119
Nothing further.

00:50.721 --> 00:52.352
So...

00:52.353 --> 00:55.355
You didn't steal
almost a billion dollars.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.786
You just lost it.

00:56.787 --> 00:58.658
Is that what you're saying?

00:58.659 --> 01:00.830
Everyone who's
ever invested with me

01:00.831 --> 01:04.294
signed a piece of paper
saying they understood the risks.

01:04.295 --> 01:06.836
If they invested what they
weren't prepared to lose,

01:06.837 --> 01:09.669
then they shouldn't have
invested in the first place.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.472
(All shouting at once)

01:12.473 --> 01:15.575
Order!

01:15.576 --> 01:16.746
(Shouting continues)

01:16.747 --> 01:18.148
Order! Now!

01:18.149 --> 01:19.809
How's it looking?

01:19.810 --> 01:21.311
Uh, the south side exit's clear.

01:21.312 --> 01:22.652
Backups are standing by.

01:22.653 --> 01:24.114
That's good.

01:24.115 --> 01:26.516
From the looks of it, we're
probably gonna need 'em.

01:26.517 --> 01:30.089
(Indistinct shouting)

01:30.090 --> 01:32.222
Don't touch me!

01:32.223 --> 01:35.825
(Indistinct shouting continues)

01:35.826 --> 01:37.827
Yeah, get a job, man! Get a job!

01:37.828 --> 01:39.399
It's all your fault!
You take my money!

01:39.400 --> 01:41.431
(Tommy) Come on. Keep
moving. Keep moving.

01:41.432 --> 01:43.433
What the hell was that?
Keep moving. Keep moving.

01:43.434 --> 01:44.604
(Panting)

01:44.605 --> 01:46.376
Is that a bouguereau?

01:46.377 --> 01:48.178
Limited series "r." Bought it from
Eric Clapton. (Tommy) Let's go.

01:48.179 --> 01:49.509
You a collector? Take the
next right, guys. Right here.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.680
No. I wish at that level.

01:50.681 --> 01:51.811
What has it got,
12 complications?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.883
Yeah, astronomical,
minute repeater,

01:53.884 --> 01:55.815
the phases of the moon... hate to
break this up, guys. Down the stairs.

01:55.816 --> 01:56.787
Straight down.

01:56.788 --> 01:58.348
(Adam) Yeah,
yeah, yeah, let's go.

01:58.349 --> 02:00.119
Okay, okay, okay.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.152
Just one flight down. One flight
down, guys. One more. One more.

02:02.153 --> 02:03.593
Keep moving. Let's go.

02:03.594 --> 02:04.754
(Adam) Okay, use this one.

02:04.755 --> 02:06.125
It's locked.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.497
I thought you said
you cleared the exit.

02:07.498 --> 02:10.129
I did. I checked it.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.762
We're sitting ducks. We
gotta get him outta here.

02:12.763 --> 02:14.634
(Clatters and hisses)
(Gerry) What's happening?

02:14.635 --> 02:16.466
Take point. Get
him upstairs. Go!

02:16.467 --> 02:18.168
(Gerry) My eyes! Help me!

02:18.169 --> 02:19.669
(Grunting and coughing)

02:19.670 --> 02:23.173
Who are you?

02:23.174 --> 02:24.914
Where are you taking me?

02:24.915 --> 02:27.247
Get in the car! (Man
shouts indistinctly)

02:27.248 --> 02:28.678
Let's go! Let's go! Let's get outta
here! Hold on! Tell me what's going on!

02:28.679 --> 02:29.879
(Tires peal)

02:29.880 --> 02:32.883
(Coughing)

02:34.455 --> 02:35.885
(Tires squeal)

02:35.886 --> 02:38.658
This is Sullivan. Request...

02:38.659 --> 02:39.929
(Engine revving)

02:39.930 --> 02:41.561
(Woman screams) (Thuds)

02:41.562 --> 02:43.162
(Tires squeal)

02:43.163 --> 02:44.734
(Woman screams)

02:44.735 --> 02:46.836
Prisoner taken from the
courthouse! (Man) You all right?

02:46.837 --> 02:48.198
A black s.U.V. Northbound arch.

02:48.199 --> 02:49.499
Somebody call an ambulance!

02:49.500 --> 02:52.171
I need an ambulance. We
got an auto/ped, hit-and-run.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.173
13th and arch, north
side of the courthouse.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.945
The victim's
female, unconscious.

02:55.946 --> 02:57.907
(Panting) (Siren wailing)

02:57.908 --> 02:59.949
(People speaking indistinctly)

02:59.950 --> 03:02.252
(Continues panting)

03:02.253 --> 03:03.913
(Honks horn)

03:03.914 --> 03:07.557
(Indistinct conversations)

03:07.558 --> 03:10.561
(Police radio chatter)

03:12.223 --> 03:14.895
(Exhales deeply)

03:16.827 --> 03:18.668
Who's that guy?

03:18.669 --> 03:20.470
You know I just
got here, too, right?

03:20.471 --> 03:21.801
I'll find out.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.973
You get started on the
body. I'll be right back.

03:23.974 --> 03:25.505
(Tommy coughs)

03:25.506 --> 03:26.636
What happened?

03:26.637 --> 03:27.877
(Coughs) You're a
sight for sore eyes.

03:27.878 --> 03:29.239
(Groans)

03:29.240 --> 03:30.640
We had the Gerry Roberts detail.

03:30.641 --> 03:32.642
Somebody snatched him
right out from underneath us.

03:32.643 --> 03:34.914
I think I got a little
bump on the head, too.

03:34.915 --> 03:35.886
(Man coughs)

03:35.887 --> 03:37.847
He needs some ice on that.

03:37.848 --> 03:40.850
Any palpitations, trouble
breathing, chest pains?

03:40.851 --> 03:42.352
No, I'm fine. (Sniffles)

03:42.353 --> 03:43.823
You are gonna go to the hospital

03:43.824 --> 03:45.855
and get x-rays on your
chest and your head.

03:45.856 --> 03:48.858
No, I am gonna
find these... (coughs)

03:48.859 --> 03:51.301
(Coughs and sniffles)

03:51.302 --> 03:52.462
Who's the body?

03:52.463 --> 03:53.803
(Sniffles) Oh, she was, uh,

03:53.804 --> 03:55.465
she was an innocent bystander.

03:55.466 --> 03:56.966
Got hit by the getaway car.

03:56.967 --> 03:59.869
It was a black s.U.V.
There was no... (coughing)

03:59.870 --> 04:02.011
License plate.

04:02.012 --> 04:04.374
You, bronchial spray
for both of them.

04:04.375 --> 04:05.975
Watch out for
hypoxia. All right.

04:05.976 --> 04:06.947
Do it.

04:06.948 --> 04:09.248
We're on it.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.582
(Radio chatter continues)

04:12.583 --> 04:15.625
Her name's Jennifer Sanchez, 44.

04:15.626 --> 04:17.457
She's got a Florida
driver's license.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.729
You think she drove all
the way up here for this?

04:19.730 --> 04:20.930
If so, it's pretty tragic.

04:20.931 --> 04:22.792
I'll say.

04:22.793 --> 04:24.294
The man you asked
about when we arrived,

04:24.295 --> 04:25.935
his name is John Anderson.

04:25.936 --> 04:29.870
He was giving her c.P.R.
When the e.M.T.S showed up.

04:32.443 --> 04:33.873
Let's get her back.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.004
Okay.

04:35.005 --> 04:36.606
Tragic and shocking
turn of events

04:36.607 --> 04:38.908
at the Gerry Roberts
financial fraud trial.

04:38.909 --> 04:40.910
Police escorting Roberts
from the courtroom

04:40.911 --> 04:42.912
were attacked by
masked men... Great.

04:42.913 --> 04:44.884
Who then kidnapped Roberts at
gunpoint. We're all over the news.

04:44.885 --> 04:45.985
(Sighs) (Continues
speaking indistinctly)

04:45.986 --> 04:47.857
How'd they figure
out the exit route?

04:47.858 --> 04:49.459
We changed it every day.

04:49.460 --> 04:50.960
Whoever did this
had enough resources

04:50.961 --> 04:52.992
to buy off a courthouse
security guard.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.964
Yeah, well, Roberts
has got resources.

04:54.965 --> 04:58.328
Roberts? The guy who screamed
for help as he was carted away?

04:58.329 --> 04:59.669
You realize the kind of
crap we're gonna be in

04:59.670 --> 05:00.830
if he ends up dead?

05:00.831 --> 05:03.873
Detectives, you
guys need to see this.

05:03.874 --> 05:05.004
This was just posted

05:05.005 --> 05:06.976
to the victims of
Gerry Roberts web site.

05:06.977 --> 05:08.578
(Clears throat)

05:08.579 --> 05:09.979
(Gerry shouts indistinctly)

05:09.980 --> 05:11.911
All right.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.713
What are you doing?!

05:13.714 --> 05:14.914
Come on. Down.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.516
No! (Grunts)

05:16.517 --> 05:18.317
(Gasps and pants)

05:18.318 --> 05:19.489
That's him.

05:19.490 --> 05:20.950
What are you doing?

05:20.951 --> 05:22.452
Brace yourselves.

05:22.453 --> 05:23.653
Oh, no.

05:23.654 --> 05:25.695
(Crying) Please don't.

05:25.696 --> 05:27.627
I'll give you your
money back! No. No.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.028
Please don't kill me! (Gunshot)

05:29.029 --> 05:30.500
Ah.

05:30.501 --> 05:32.002
(Exhales)

05:44.745 --> 05:45.745
(Grunts)

05:45.746 --> 05:47.717
(Gasps and pants)

05:47.718 --> 05:50.550
(Crying) Please don't.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.482
I'll give you your money back!

05:52.483 --> 05:53.753
Please don't kill me!

05:53.754 --> 05:55.385
(Gunshot)

05:55.386 --> 05:57.387
(Exhales)

05:57.388 --> 05:58.958
A billion dollars missing,

05:58.959 --> 06:00.860
and the only man who
knows where that is

06:00.861 --> 06:02.492
is dead.

06:02.493 --> 06:03.793
Do you have any idea the
kind of pressure I'm under

06:03.794 --> 06:05.435
because of you two?

06:05.436 --> 06:07.537
How did these men
get the drop on you?

06:07.538 --> 06:08.898
Somebody figured
out our exit route.

06:08.899 --> 06:10.369
You cleared it before you left?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.871
Yes, ma'am. We
had the green light.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.673
So their plan was
better than yours.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.945
Terrific.

06:15.946 --> 06:17.947
The FBI broke the Roberts case,

06:17.948 --> 06:19.749
and our job was just to
babysit the defendant,

06:19.750 --> 06:21.451
and we couldn't
even manage that.

06:21.452 --> 06:23.713
Now the FBI is
demanding accountability.

06:23.714 --> 06:25.585
The national press corps
is demanding answers.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.857
Now what the hell do
you suggest I tell them?

06:27.858 --> 06:29.388
Tell them it was an inside job.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.020
Somebody bought off a
courthouse security guard,

06:31.021 --> 06:32.992
and he tipped off
our security route.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.025
What else could it be?

06:36.026 --> 06:37.627
Then here's what
you're gonna do...

06:37.628 --> 06:38.768
You're gonna find that leak.

06:38.769 --> 06:40.830
And you're gonna
find Roberts' killers.

06:40.831 --> 06:42.171
Because we're gonna have to pull

06:42.172 --> 06:43.733
something positive
out of this catastrophe,

06:43.734 --> 06:45.535
or I'm gonna have
both of your asses

06:45.536 --> 06:46.876
mounted on my wall.

06:46.877 --> 06:48.137
Understand me?

06:48.138 --> 06:49.839
(Both) Yes, ma'am.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.842
Go do it.

06:53.083 --> 06:57.186
Multiple blunt force
traumatic injuries.

06:57.187 --> 07:01.621
Multiple associated fractures.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.623
I'm guessing that
she exsanguinated

07:03.624 --> 07:05.024
from internal hemorrhaging.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.896
Look at this.

07:06.897 --> 07:08.628
Zipper pull's deformed.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.030
Must have caught on something
as the car went over her.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.533
Looks like it took some
paint chips along with it.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.834
What was the name
of that web site again,

07:14.835 --> 07:16.035
the one with the video on it?

07:16.036 --> 07:18.438
Victimsofgerry.org.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.040
Hey.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.743
I thought you said that,
uh, video was ghoulish.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.014
I'm not looking at the video.

07:25.015 --> 07:26.816
I'm looking at Jennifer
Sanchez's page.

07:26.817 --> 07:29.619
(Scrapes)

07:29.620 --> 07:31.751
It looks like there's
some trace on her pant leg

07:31.752 --> 07:33.783
from the, uh, tire tread.

07:33.784 --> 07:35.855
Jennifer Sanchez, secretary,

07:35.856 --> 07:38.829
divorcee, lives with parents.

07:40.130 --> 07:43.192
Convinced her family
to invest their life savings

07:43.193 --> 07:45.194
with Gerry Roberts.

07:45.195 --> 07:46.837
(Sighs)

07:48.198 --> 07:50.099
(Sighs)

07:50.100 --> 07:51.801
Let's get started.

07:51.802 --> 07:53.143
Okay.

07:55.906 --> 07:58.047
I did clear that exit.

07:58.048 --> 07:59.749
Well, it wasn't clear
when we got there, was it?

07:59.750 --> 08:01.681
It would've been exactly the
same thing if you'd done it.

08:01.682 --> 08:02.752
Look, Adam, we could
talk about this all day.

08:02.753 --> 08:03.913
This is not helping.

08:03.914 --> 08:05.555
No, it isn't.

08:05.556 --> 08:07.617
Somebody got the jump on us.
We gotta do something to fix it.

08:07.618 --> 08:08.918
Okay. What's next?

08:08.919 --> 08:11.490
The video. The video?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.763
We're not gonna get a
courthouse security guard like that.

08:13.764 --> 08:14.964
Forget about the security guard.

08:14.965 --> 08:16.495
There's... there's something
else going on here.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.628
Forget about the
courthouse security guard...

08:18.629 --> 08:19.900
What do you got?

08:21.501 --> 08:23.774
I don't know yet. You go first.

08:25.175 --> 08:26.836
Victim's name is
Jennifer Sanchez.

08:26.837 --> 08:29.679
Avulsion of the renal arteries
and subsequent exsanguination

08:29.680 --> 08:31.641
is the official cause of death.

08:31.642 --> 08:34.615
Lab is running trace. Your turn.

08:37.187 --> 08:38.718
All right.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.250
In your expert medical opinion,

08:41.251 --> 08:43.853
could Roberts have
faked that video?

08:43.854 --> 08:44.994
Are you for... are you real...

08:44.995 --> 08:46.525
Let... let... let
the doctor speak.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.099
You mean faked his own death?

08:50.761 --> 08:52.632
Huh.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.835
Blood spatter looked
pretty real to me, but...

08:55.836 --> 08:57.236
Can't be sure without a body.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.308
Can we please just
hold on one second?

08:59.309 --> 09:01.911
(Tommy) Let's just consider
the situation here, okay?

09:01.912 --> 09:03.573
Roberts is in custody.
He's about to be convicted.

09:03.574 --> 09:04.914
Why risk killing him if it means

09:04.915 --> 09:06.045
you're not gonna
get your money back?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.617
The guys in the
video didn't look like

09:07.618 --> 09:08.778
they wanted their money back.

09:08.779 --> 09:09.919
Yeah, but that's all
just part of the ruse.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.921
I mean, most
snuff films are faked

09:11.922 --> 09:13.753
because there's one piece of
evidence they can never find.

09:13.754 --> 09:14.854
It's the body.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.155
Now why hasn't
Roberts' body showed up?

09:16.156 --> 09:17.687
Because he's alive

09:17.688 --> 09:19.558
and he's the one who
leaked our exit route.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.730
Find him, find the money...

09:20.731 --> 09:22.161
We go from goats to heroes.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.693
Okay, what if you're wrong?

09:23.694 --> 09:25.665
Look, I'm gonna take
the heat as long as I can,

09:25.666 --> 09:26.966
but in the meantime, Roberts'
last known whereabouts

09:26.967 --> 09:28.738
is on that video
where he got shot.

09:28.739 --> 09:30.139
Now the FBI,

09:30.140 --> 09:31.871
they got some people
trained in video analysis.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.703
Maybe one of us
should pay 'em a visit.

09:33.704 --> 09:35.004
That'd be me.

09:35.005 --> 09:36.706
(Scoffs, opens drawer)

09:36.707 --> 09:38.949
This is such a long
shot. (Closes drawer)

09:40.911 --> 09:42.012
Nice theory.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.616
There was some poetic
justice in Roberts being dead.

09:46.617 --> 09:48.257
But if he's alive...

09:48.258 --> 09:49.789
Even better.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.320
Let me know.

09:51.321 --> 09:52.992
Uh, listen, Megan.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.694
(Exhales)

09:54.695 --> 09:57.026
Look, I meant to tell you,
but with everything going on...

09:57.027 --> 09:58.668
But I got a call
from the crime lab.

09:58.669 --> 10:00.069
They started working on
your father's suicide note.

10:00.070 --> 10:02.231
I should get the
results in a day or two.

10:02.232 --> 10:03.833
(Sighs)

10:03.834 --> 10:05.706
Thanks.

10:07.177 --> 10:08.337
(Man) Come on. Down.

10:08.338 --> 10:09.879
No! (Grunts)

10:09.880 --> 10:11.711
(Gasps and pants)

10:11.712 --> 10:12.882
We were part of the team
that investigated Roberts

10:12.883 --> 10:13.943
in the first place.

10:13.944 --> 10:15.614
(Crying) Please
don't. Oh, really?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.616
I'll give you your money
back! I didn't know that.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.318
We're all thrilled to see him
go down. Please don't kill me!

10:19.319 --> 10:20.790
(Gunshot)

10:20.791 --> 10:21.951
Just not like that.

10:21.952 --> 10:22.952
(Adam) Mm.

10:22.953 --> 10:25.325
Okay, Julie. Let's take it back.

10:27.728 --> 10:28.898
What are you doing?!

10:28.899 --> 10:30.059
Come on. Down.

10:30.060 --> 10:31.330
No! (Grunts)

10:31.331 --> 10:32.862
(Gasps and pants)

10:32.863 --> 10:34.103
Hey, you hear that?

10:34.104 --> 10:36.035
(Taps button) What?

10:36.036 --> 10:37.907
(Crying) Please don't. Underneath
the highway noise was a clicking sound.

10:37.908 --> 10:39.809
I'll give you your money
back! A highway traffic counter?

10:39.810 --> 10:41.210
(Clicking sound)
Please don't kill me!

10:41.211 --> 10:42.872
No, the interval's too
regular, right? (Rewinds tape)

10:42.873 --> 10:45.644
It sounds like there's a
bell in the background, too,

10:45.645 --> 10:46.816
real faint.

10:46.817 --> 10:47.977
(Crying) Please don't.

10:47.978 --> 10:49.349
Play it again.

10:52.983 --> 10:54.984
What are you doing?!

10:54.985 --> 10:57.326
Take a listen. Thank you.

10:57.327 --> 10:59.228
(Grunts)

10:59.229 --> 11:00.930
(Gasps and pants)

11:00.931 --> 11:02.832
(Bell tolling)
(Crying) Please don't.

11:02.833 --> 11:04.363
I'll give you your money
back! (Taps button)

11:04.364 --> 11:07.336
Um, have either
of you ladies ever,

11:07.337 --> 11:10.669
um, surfed the rail yards?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.441
Surfed the rail yards?

11:12.442 --> 11:13.843
Yeah, like on a dare.

11:13.844 --> 11:15.805
We used to go container
hopping in high school.

11:15.806 --> 11:18.848
Anyway, that is the sound of
one train crossing the tracks

11:18.849 --> 11:20.179
as it enters the rail yards.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.711
And there is only one yard

11:21.712 --> 11:24.884
with a highway and a
church in the same vicinity.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.916
Thank you.

11:26.917 --> 11:28.758
(Bell tolling)

11:28.759 --> 11:31.761
How is it that
nobody called this in?

11:31.762 --> 11:32.822
(Adam) Well, a lot
goes on in the yards

11:32.823 --> 11:34.393
no one ever sees.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.165
Yeah, it's detective Sullivan.

11:36.166 --> 11:37.867
I need a c.S.U. Unit.

11:37.868 --> 11:39.829
We're in a lot across the
tracks from St. Vincent's.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.430
I got a burnt car.

11:41.431 --> 11:42.802
(Camera shutter clicks)

11:42.803 --> 11:45.435
Body in the back...
What's left of one.

11:48.779 --> 11:50.810
That's what
post-cremation looks like.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.441
You see the chalky white
texture on the bones?

11:52.442 --> 11:55.285
D.n.a.'s been destroyed.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.248
Ethan.

11:59.249 --> 12:00.419
Huh? Pictures.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.792
Right. Right. Sorry.

12:04.354 --> 12:05.995
What's that?

12:05.996 --> 12:08.758
Looks like a bone that
escaped the fire damage.

12:08.759 --> 12:11.730
From the width of it, I'd
say it's part of the fibula.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.834
Hey, I've got teeth.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.065
Three...

12:16.066 --> 12:17.967
No, four.

12:17.968 --> 12:19.809
Any idea what that is?

12:19.810 --> 12:22.171
Dental implants.

12:22.172 --> 12:23.943
Does Roberts have dentures?

12:23.944 --> 12:26.015
God, I hope not.

12:26.016 --> 12:27.877
Well, between the
fibula and the teeth,

12:27.878 --> 12:29.819
we'll have plenty of d.N.A.

12:29.820 --> 12:31.750
We'll know soon
enough if it's Roberts.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.153
(Sighs) Tommy.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.524
Ah, jeez.

12:35.525 --> 12:36.826
What do you got?

12:36.827 --> 12:38.227
(Huffs)

12:38.228 --> 12:40.860
This is the bouguereau
limited series "r"

12:40.861 --> 12:42.792
with its 12 complications.

12:42.793 --> 12:44.133
Meaning what?

12:44.134 --> 12:46.035
(Tommy) Meaning...

12:46.036 --> 12:47.797
It's Gerry Roberts' watch.

12:47.798 --> 12:50.100
The video is not a fake.

12:58.809 --> 13:00.349
(Tommy) Well, you do realize,

13:00.350 --> 13:02.051
if this is Roberts,
we're screwed.

13:02.052 --> 13:03.512
We're never gonna get that
money back that he stole.

13:03.513 --> 13:06.055
Sorry. You're screwed.

13:06.056 --> 13:07.356
R-Really?

13:07.357 --> 13:10.089
Yeah. Turns out Roberts
did have dentures.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.261
Full uppers, partial lowers,

13:12.262 --> 13:15.464
with titanium
stabilization implants.

13:15.465 --> 13:17.967
What teeth he did have
left are a perfect match.

13:17.968 --> 13:19.969
And then there's the d.N.A.

13:19.970 --> 13:22.231
The top is from the fibula,

13:22.232 --> 13:25.434
the bottom from a hair taken
from Roberts' penthouse.

13:25.435 --> 13:27.076
Also a perfect match.

13:27.077 --> 13:28.537
Great. Billion dollars gone,

13:28.538 --> 13:30.039
thousands of victims
never made whole...

13:30.040 --> 13:31.210
That's on us.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.541
We can still catch the killers,

13:32.542 --> 13:35.044
unless we're demoted
to patrol cops first.

13:35.045 --> 13:36.846
You got any leads
that I don't know about?

13:36.847 --> 13:39.088
As a matter of fact, we do.

13:39.089 --> 13:41.550
The results came back
from the s.U.V. Paint chips

13:41.551 --> 13:44.193
and the trace
from the tire treads.

13:44.194 --> 13:46.095
We found a type
of moss in the tread

13:46.096 --> 13:47.396
that doesn't grow in Philly.

13:47.397 --> 13:49.058
Hell, it doesn't even
grow in the states.

13:49.059 --> 13:50.229
Well, where does it grow?

13:50.230 --> 13:51.400
The east coast of China.

13:51.401 --> 13:53.102
Most prevalent
around port cities.

13:53.103 --> 13:54.964
Something to do
with the saltwater.

13:54.965 --> 13:56.505
$250 million

13:56.506 --> 13:59.608
of the roughly $1 billion
that Roberts stole came from

13:59.609 --> 14:03.042
the Chinese government's
private investment fund.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.373
Yeah, but there's
plenty of companies

14:04.374 --> 14:06.315
that manufacture cars in China.

14:06.316 --> 14:08.978
That's true, detective.

14:08.979 --> 14:11.320
But then...

14:11.321 --> 14:13.322
There's also the paint chips.

14:13.323 --> 14:14.853
(Scoffs)

14:14.854 --> 14:17.026
You see, for security reasons,

14:17.027 --> 14:18.127
the Chinese
government customizes

14:18.128 --> 14:20.089
all of their consular vehicles

14:20.090 --> 14:23.062
before shipping them to the U.S.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.334
Part of that
customization is a coat

14:25.335 --> 14:28.497
of patent-pending
impact resistant paint.

14:28.498 --> 14:30.139
(Curtis) Anybody want to guess

14:30.140 --> 14:32.372
what kind of paint this is?

14:34.174 --> 14:36.505
The idea that anyone working

14:36.506 --> 14:39.448
in any official capacity for
the Chinese government

14:39.449 --> 14:43.012
could have anything to do
with Roberts' murder is absurd.

14:43.013 --> 14:44.483
What about an
unofficial capacity?

14:44.484 --> 14:45.985
What about the s.U.V.?

14:45.986 --> 14:49.518
He was kidnapped in a
Chinese consular vehicle.

14:49.519 --> 14:51.020
A stolen consular vehicle.

14:51.021 --> 14:52.661
(Adam) There's no
record of any vehicle

14:52.662 --> 14:54.393
stolen from the
Chinese consulate.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.565
We didn't report it. Why not?

14:56.566 --> 14:59.168
We like to take care of
these matters internally.

14:59.169 --> 15:01.070
Like offing someone who
stole money from you?

15:01.071 --> 15:02.371
Detective.

15:02.372 --> 15:04.003
The Chinese government
had nothing to do with this,

15:04.004 --> 15:05.274
I assure you.

15:05.275 --> 15:07.036
Now it seems quite clear to me

15:07.037 --> 15:09.208
that someone is trying to
make it look as though we did.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.511
That would be most
unfortunate for them.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.682
There are enough
misunderstandings

15:13.683 --> 15:15.044
between our countries

15:15.045 --> 15:18.687
without someone
trying to create more.

15:18.688 --> 15:21.250
Don't you agree, Dr. Murphy?

15:21.251 --> 15:23.422
Of course.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.955
Uh, we'll need the record
of that stolen vehicle.

15:25.956 --> 15:27.396
I will see that you get them.

15:27.397 --> 15:29.098
(Kate) And if there are any
developments on your end,

15:29.099 --> 15:30.499
you will let us know?

15:30.500 --> 15:32.701
Naturally. We'll be watching
this case with great interest.

15:32.702 --> 15:36.035
We want justice
as much as you do.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.336
(People speaking indistinctly)

15:37.337 --> 15:39.038
What was that all about?

15:39.039 --> 15:40.339
What was what all about?

15:40.340 --> 15:42.671
"We take care of these
matters internally."

15:42.672 --> 15:45.514
"Blaming the Chinese
would be most unfortunate."

15:45.515 --> 15:47.046
Those were veiled threats.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.218
You just smiled and
agreed with the guy.

15:49.219 --> 15:52.081
Megan, we tread extremely
carefully here, understand?

15:52.082 --> 15:53.252
Mm-hmm.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.583
Listen, if that
s.U.V. Was stolen,

15:54.584 --> 15:55.985
the only physical
evidence we have left

15:55.986 --> 15:57.256
is back in your morgue.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.527
Meaning what?

15:58.528 --> 16:01.030
Meaning do what you do.

16:01.031 --> 16:02.161
Go back to the bodies.
Find me something.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.662
There's nothing
left to find, Tommy.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.164
Why don't you go find something?

16:05.165 --> 16:06.136
I found something.

16:06.137 --> 16:08.197
Okay. Ha.

16:08.198 --> 16:10.199
I can't imagine why you two
didn't work out as a couple.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.640
Let's go. Where?

16:11.641 --> 16:13.103
Back to the bodies.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.047
(Exhales)

16:29.089 --> 16:31.260
(Chart thuds)

16:31.261 --> 16:33.162
(Exhales)

16:33.163 --> 16:35.124
Hey, you know that phrase,

16:35.125 --> 16:36.625
"a watched pot never boils"?

16:36.626 --> 16:38.167
Shh. You're annoying me.

16:38.168 --> 16:40.029
You asked me to stay.

16:40.030 --> 16:42.301
And besides, we've
already looked at everything.

16:42.302 --> 16:45.435
Then let's look again.

16:50.180 --> 16:52.481
I'm not helping, so I
think I'm just gonna leave.

16:52.482 --> 16:55.384
Wait.

16:55.385 --> 16:57.686
This is loose.

16:57.687 --> 16:59.118
Yeah?

16:59.119 --> 17:01.120
Well...

17:01.121 --> 17:02.421
Of course it's loose.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.593
It's been through
a 2,000-degree fire.

17:04.594 --> 17:06.155
No, implants are permanent.

17:06.156 --> 17:08.157
They eventually fuse
with the bone over time.

17:08.158 --> 17:10.299
It's called osseointegration.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.201
This should be rock-solid.

17:12.202 --> 17:14.134
When did Roberts
get his implants?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.367
Mm. Uh...

17:18.368 --> 17:21.110
Three years ago.

17:21.111 --> 17:22.371
(Snaps)

17:22.372 --> 17:24.773
Ah. Look at that. No
osseointegration whatsoever.

17:24.774 --> 17:26.415
Wait. Which you just
said is impossible.

17:26.416 --> 17:29.578
No, not if you took

17:29.579 --> 17:31.150
Robert's real tooth...

17:31.151 --> 17:32.551
Right.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.223
Then a new implant...

17:34.224 --> 17:35.424
Yeah.

17:35.425 --> 17:39.129
And put them in the
jawbone of another man.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.831
We pulled d.N.A.
From his fibula.

17:42.832 --> 17:44.533
A piece of his fibula,

17:44.534 --> 17:46.835
which I'm guessing...

17:46.836 --> 17:48.697
Is the exact same length

17:48.698 --> 17:51.840
as the steel rod
used to replace it.

17:51.841 --> 17:53.742
Ha! These guys are good.

17:53.743 --> 17:55.804
(Chuckles) What guys?

17:55.805 --> 18:00.110
The guys who are helping
Roberts fake his own death.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.590
Shockingly...

18:11.591 --> 18:13.262
Tommy was right.

18:13.263 --> 18:15.264
Roberts faked his own death.

18:15.265 --> 18:16.625
(Tommy) Well, he
had a good plan.

18:16.626 --> 18:18.127
I mean, for starters,
he's got a well-armed,

18:18.128 --> 18:20.199
well-trained,
well-funded strike force,

18:20.200 --> 18:22.131
probably ex-military.

18:22.132 --> 18:25.204
Yeah, and whoever did
it stole a consular s.U.V.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.875
Implicating the Chinese,
knowing that they'd be suspects

18:26.876 --> 18:30.139
after Roberts burnt
them for $250 million.

18:30.140 --> 18:32.110
(Megan) Then he
manufactured the forensics,

18:32.111 --> 18:33.612
taking his own teeth,
surgically implanting them

18:33.613 --> 18:35.314
into the jawbone of another man,

18:35.315 --> 18:37.216
and then taking a
piece of his fibula,

18:37.217 --> 18:38.717
positioning it in a way

18:38.718 --> 18:40.719
that it looked like
it escaped the fire.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.791
You're talking two separate
surgical procedures.

18:42.792 --> 18:44.293
Well, the guy's got
close to a billion dollars

18:44.294 --> 18:45.794
of other people's
money stashed away.

18:45.795 --> 18:47.356
How far would you go to keep it?

18:47.357 --> 18:49.628
(Megan) To pull it off,
he would need somebody

18:49.629 --> 18:50.799
who had forensic expertise.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.130
And I hate to say it, Kate,

18:52.131 --> 18:53.662
we are looking for
one of our own...

18:53.663 --> 18:55.164
A forensic pathologist.

18:55.165 --> 18:56.405
(Kate) Okay.

18:56.406 --> 18:57.736
Roberts has been
under house arrest

18:57.737 --> 18:59.368
since the day charges
were filed, right?

18:59.369 --> 19:00.839
So how does he
pull all of this together

19:00.840 --> 19:02.871
when he's been watched 24/7?

19:02.872 --> 19:05.143
That's an excellent question.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.216
So Roberts is alive,

19:07.217 --> 19:09.218
despite pronouncements
to the contrary

19:09.219 --> 19:10.549
from this office.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.321
I had two separate
sources of d.N.A.

19:12.322 --> 19:13.882
Confirming it was Roberts.

19:13.883 --> 19:15.724
It's a shame you didn't
have all the information

19:15.725 --> 19:17.926
when you made a trip to
the Chinese consulate today.

19:17.927 --> 19:19.858
We had every
justification at the time.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.891
Justification to accuse
Chinese government officials

19:22.892 --> 19:24.393
of conspiracy and murder?

19:24.394 --> 19:26.235
(Tommy) We didn't
accuse anybody.

19:26.236 --> 19:27.696
Yeah, we...
Well, I did. Sort of.

19:27.697 --> 19:29.438
Well, she did.

19:29.439 --> 19:30.769
The consulate's lodged

19:30.770 --> 19:32.771
an official complaint
against the department.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.343
I'm starting to think
that our relationship

19:34.344 --> 19:35.674
with the m.E.'S department

19:35.675 --> 19:37.676
has gotten just a
little bit too cozy.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.449
You know, we're actually
supposed to assist each other

19:40.450 --> 19:42.851
and not magnify
each other's screwups.

19:42.852 --> 19:45.183
You four put your
heads together,

19:45.184 --> 19:47.556
and suddenly I
am putting out fires.

19:47.557 --> 19:49.558
Megan, detectives,
I think the chief and I

19:49.559 --> 19:51.720
need to have a
conversation in private.

19:51.721 --> 19:53.192
Yeah.

19:57.227 --> 19:58.727
We didn't screw up anything.

19:58.728 --> 20:00.369
We proved the
forensics were false.

20:00.370 --> 20:02.371
All right, don't let
chief Martin get to you.

20:02.372 --> 20:03.872
She just likes to
get up in your face.

20:03.873 --> 20:05.534
I don't give a crap
about the chief.

20:05.535 --> 20:07.236
Somebody's toying with us.

20:07.237 --> 20:09.608
Meanwhile, Jennifer
Sanchez is still dead.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.939
What are we doing about that?

20:10.940 --> 20:12.341
No, Dr. Murphy's
got a point, though.

20:12.342 --> 20:14.243
Roberts has been under
house arrest for months.

20:14.244 --> 20:15.584
With a police guard
and a video log

20:15.585 --> 20:16.915
of everybody coming and going.

20:16.916 --> 20:17.887
We should take a look.

20:17.888 --> 20:19.218
Let me know what you find out.

20:20.950 --> 20:23.392
So your father's suicide note
was written under duress?

20:23.393 --> 20:25.394
What are you doing?
That's my work.

20:25.395 --> 20:27.796
You gave his suicide
note to the police

20:27.797 --> 20:29.458
so they could analyze
his handwriting?

20:29.459 --> 20:30.829
You already know
the answer to that

20:30.830 --> 20:32.331
since you just read the report.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.962
You know, I gave you that note

20:33.963 --> 20:35.664
so you could
finally get closure,

20:35.665 --> 20:37.005
not to open an investigation.

20:37.006 --> 20:38.907
Of course I'm
having it analyzed.

20:38.908 --> 20:40.909
Why? So I can find out
what really happened.

20:40.910 --> 20:42.611
I told you what really happened.

20:42.612 --> 20:44.743
No, you told me what
you believe happened.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.944
This is what I do.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.746
I follow the evidence
until I find the truth.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.977
When the evidence proves

20:48.978 --> 20:51.019
what I've been saying all along,

20:51.020 --> 20:53.782
I hope I will get an
apology from you.

20:53.783 --> 20:54.953
(Sighs)

20:54.954 --> 20:55.925
(Folder thuds)

20:55.926 --> 20:57.426
What did you want, mom?

20:57.427 --> 20:58.887
I wanted to take you to lunch,

20:58.888 --> 21:00.930
but I can see
you're far too busy.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.865
(Kate) Angela, I
sympathize with you.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.037
I do. I don't like
putting out fires either.

21:09.038 --> 21:10.899
But you're gonna like
it a hell of a lot less

21:10.900 --> 21:12.571
when a case comes
along that you can't close

21:12.572 --> 21:14.403
because you've
shut this office out

21:14.404 --> 21:16.505
and somehow, the
press gets wind of it.

21:16.506 --> 21:18.607
Is that a threat?

21:18.608 --> 21:20.949
It's an inevitability.

21:20.950 --> 21:25.283
Now why don't you tell me
what you're really doing here?

21:25.284 --> 21:27.886
I've been asked by
your friend, the d.A.,

21:27.887 --> 21:30.459
to endorse your candidacy.

21:30.460 --> 21:31.790
(Chuckles)

21:31.791 --> 21:33.462
If I do so,

21:33.463 --> 21:36.294
it'll be under one condition.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.928
You start keeping a
tighter leash on your people.

21:41.401 --> 21:44.634
I will keep that in mind.

21:50.610 --> 21:51.980
(Indistinct conversations)

21:51.981 --> 21:53.442
Detective Sullivan.

21:53.443 --> 21:55.714
Officer Dunn. What
brings you here?

21:55.715 --> 21:57.446
I had a hunch you might be here.

21:57.447 --> 21:59.448
The Chinese consulate
delivered the file

21:59.449 --> 22:01.420
on the stolen s.U.V.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.891
Did you read it?

22:02.892 --> 22:05.924
The vehicle was
manufactured in China,

22:05.925 --> 22:07.726
shipped here, then it was stolen

22:07.727 --> 22:09.898
from a supermarket
parking lot in wynnewood.

22:09.899 --> 22:11.930
There's been no
trace of it since.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.464
You didn't come here to
tell us we hit a dead end?

22:16.436 --> 22:17.936
Uh, actually, I was wondering

22:17.937 --> 22:19.738
what you were
doing Friday night.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.940
I have two tickets to
the sixers/knicks game,

22:21.941 --> 22:24.042
and I thought I
would pay you back

22:24.043 --> 22:25.944
for taking me to see the flyers.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.676
Thank you.

22:27.677 --> 22:30.549
Yeah, I-I can't.
It's, uh, poker night.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.381
I'm hosting.

22:32.382 --> 22:33.982
Another time?

22:33.983 --> 22:35.624
Sure. No problem.

22:35.625 --> 22:37.356
You have my number.

22:42.061 --> 22:44.032
(Tommy) Well,
according to this log,

22:44.033 --> 22:47.866
Roberts had 53 visitors
of a period of 4 months.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.037
(Video playing without audio)

22:49.038 --> 22:50.639
So officer Dunn...

22:50.640 --> 22:53.872
You, uh, made up poker
just to let her down easy?

22:53.873 --> 22:56.044
Yeah.

22:56.045 --> 22:57.846
She's very attractive.

22:57.847 --> 22:59.648
Something wrong with you?

22:59.649 --> 23:01.450
Megan and I went out
for drinks the other night.

23:01.451 --> 23:02.951
We kinda turned a corner.

23:02.952 --> 23:04.453
I just don't want
to screw it up.

23:04.454 --> 23:05.954
A corner. What, did
you sleep with her?

23:05.955 --> 23:07.616
I'm not talking
about 20 years ago.

23:07.617 --> 23:08.917
I mean, like, now,

23:08.918 --> 23:09.988
did you sleep...

23:09.989 --> 23:11.990
(Clears throat)

23:11.991 --> 23:13.822
Listen, I-I got the
greatest respect

23:13.823 --> 23:16.124
for Megan as a doctor.

23:16.125 --> 23:17.996
But she let you
down more than once.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.628
You want to keep on,
like, running into that

23:19.629 --> 23:21.069
when you got this
attractive woman,

23:21.070 --> 23:22.801
she's chasing you about?

23:22.802 --> 23:25.474
You know, you're probably
not gonna believe this,

23:25.475 --> 23:26.635
but someday,

23:26.636 --> 23:28.477
having an attractive
woman chase you around

23:28.478 --> 23:29.978
isn't gonna be all that.

23:29.979 --> 23:32.881
You're right. I
don't believe you.

23:32.882 --> 23:34.683
Wait a second.

23:34.684 --> 23:35.944
Right here.

23:35.945 --> 23:38.447
Who is that?

23:38.448 --> 23:39.918
The good samaritan.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.690
(Papers rustle)

23:41.691 --> 23:43.552
Oh, yeah.

23:43.553 --> 23:46.725
Oh, the guy who was helping Jennifer
Sanchez at the scene. (Clicks pen)

23:46.726 --> 23:50.859
11:44.

23:50.860 --> 23:53.602
John Anderson.

23:53.603 --> 23:54.904
(Whispers) John Anderson.

23:56.506 --> 23:59.437
What are you doing at
Gerry Roberts' apartment,

23:59.438 --> 24:02.040
John Anderson?

24:02.041 --> 24:04.042
This was taken from the lobby
of Roberts' apartment building

24:04.043 --> 24:05.974
while he was on house arrest.

24:05.975 --> 24:07.145
Who is it?

24:07.146 --> 24:08.947
Oh, it's, uh, John Anderson.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.819
He's the guy who tried
to save Jennifer Sanchez

24:10.820 --> 24:12.080
at the crime scene.

24:12.081 --> 24:14.152
What was he doing in the lobby?

24:14.153 --> 24:15.724
(Tommy) Good question.

24:15.725 --> 24:17.055
We think he might
be a go-between.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.226
He set up the kidnapping.

24:18.227 --> 24:19.758
But he's definitely a bad guy.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.159
And you know that because?

24:21.160 --> 24:23.532
(Adam) Well, everything
he told the police is bogus...

24:23.533 --> 24:25.534
His name, his address,
his phone number.

24:25.535 --> 24:27.836
All we've got is his picture.

24:27.837 --> 24:30.569
Actually, we have
more than that.

24:30.570 --> 24:34.573
He gave Jennifer Sanchez
mouth-to-mouth c.P.R.

24:34.574 --> 24:37.205
At the crime scene.

24:37.206 --> 24:39.077
Ethan...

24:39.078 --> 24:42.882
I need you to do
something for me right now.

24:50.019 --> 24:52.260
Ethan, talk to me.

24:52.261 --> 24:54.593
I swabbed Jennifer
Sanchez's lips,

24:54.594 --> 24:55.924
and the lab found foreign d.N.A.

24:55.925 --> 24:56.965
Run it through c.O.D.I.S.?

24:56.966 --> 24:58.997
Of course.

24:58.998 --> 25:03.171
Dr. Colin Olsson,
forensic pathologist.

25:03.172 --> 25:04.533
From New York state.

25:04.534 --> 25:05.874
There's more to show you.

25:05.875 --> 25:06.975
I did a search on his name.

25:06.976 --> 25:08.678
This is what came up.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.612
(Megan) He died five years ago?

25:13.613 --> 25:15.615
(Tommy) How's that possible?

25:30.660 --> 25:34.603
This is Dr. Colin Olsson,
forensic pathologist.

25:34.604 --> 25:35.934
He forged prescriptions

25:35.935 --> 25:38.106
to obtain over
30,000 oxycontin pills

25:38.107 --> 25:40.609
that he then sold
through the state.

25:40.610 --> 25:42.170
He was sentenced to ten years.

25:42.171 --> 25:44.573
He was ordered to report
to prison one month later,

25:44.574 --> 25:45.914
but he never made it.

25:45.915 --> 25:47.245
He died in a car crash.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.117
The only thing left to I.D. Him

25:49.118 --> 25:50.819
were a few teeth.

25:50.820 --> 25:52.581
Clearly he's good at this.

25:52.582 --> 25:54.552
So Roberts tracks him down,

25:54.553 --> 25:57.085
hires him to disappear himself.

25:57.086 --> 26:00.058
How would Roberts
know how to find this guy?

26:00.059 --> 26:01.960
I don't know. Do we
have that "after" picture?

26:01.961 --> 26:03.262
Yeah.

26:04.263 --> 26:07.195
Oh, it looks like he's
had some work done.

26:07.196 --> 26:08.697
Bet Roberts does the same thing.

26:08.698 --> 26:09.968
Yeah, which means that

26:09.969 --> 26:11.640
we don't have long
before he's in the wind.

26:11.641 --> 26:12.801
How are we gonna find him?

26:12.802 --> 26:14.302
Well, Olsson has a wife.

26:14.303 --> 26:16.144
If we can get her
to lead us to Olsson,

26:16.145 --> 26:18.146
we can get Olsson
to lead us to Roberts.

26:18.147 --> 26:20.348
How is she gonna
lead you to her husband

26:20.349 --> 26:21.880
if she thinks he's dead?

26:21.881 --> 26:23.612
We just get her
to talk about him,

26:23.613 --> 26:24.913
find out what his
hobbies are, his habits...

26:24.914 --> 26:26.685
Anything that can
help us track him down.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.016
What if she doesn't
think he's dead?

26:28.017 --> 26:29.187
Maybe she's in on it.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.889
There was no insurance pay out.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.861
She did not benefit
from his death.

26:32.862 --> 26:35.023
Olsson did. He
didn't go to prison.

26:35.024 --> 26:36.164
If she helped him,

26:36.165 --> 26:37.325
and you started
asking her questions,

26:37.326 --> 26:38.326
it's gonna tip her off.

26:38.327 --> 26:39.868
What do you suggest?

26:39.869 --> 26:42.331
Let me talk to her.

26:45.034 --> 26:46.204
Mrs. Olsson?

26:46.205 --> 26:47.375
Oh, yes.

26:47.376 --> 26:48.807
Hi. I'm Megan hunt.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.038
I'm with the medical
examiner's office.

26:50.039 --> 26:51.209
Hi.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.811
I work with detectives
Sullivan and Lucas.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.743
They're a little bit tied
up right now. I apologize.

26:54.744 --> 26:55.914
That's fine.

26:55.915 --> 26:58.386
Um, do you know
what I'm doing here?

26:58.387 --> 27:01.089
They said it was about
my husband's death,

27:01.090 --> 27:03.291
but there was no
foul play involved.

27:03.292 --> 27:05.293
I'm sure they'll
explain it all to you.

27:05.294 --> 27:06.655
Please sit.

27:06.656 --> 27:07.927
Okay.

27:09.328 --> 27:12.330
I'm so sorry about your husband.

27:12.331 --> 27:13.331
Thank you.

27:13.332 --> 27:14.903
How long ago
was it that he died?

27:14.904 --> 27:16.705
Uh, five years this summer.

27:16.706 --> 27:17.866
Ah. That's hard.

27:17.867 --> 27:19.037
Yeah.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.268
You must miss him.

27:20.269 --> 27:21.770
I do. (Exhales)

27:21.771 --> 27:23.411
I miss the good times.

27:23.412 --> 27:25.143
Not the bad.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.215
Ah. You mean his arrest?

27:27.216 --> 27:28.416
No.

27:28.417 --> 27:31.279
Actually, it started
long before that.

27:31.280 --> 27:32.852
Really? How so?

27:34.353 --> 27:37.055
Well, my husband
loved being a doctor.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.427
But he also loved to gamble.

27:39.428 --> 27:40.389
Ah.

27:40.390 --> 27:43.391
Yeah. It's what ruined him.

27:43.392 --> 27:46.164
The whole oxycontin
thing was to pay off

27:46.165 --> 27:48.837
debts he ran up
playing online poker.

27:48.838 --> 27:50.068
(Sighs)

27:50.069 --> 27:53.301
Did you know that
he had this problem?

27:53.302 --> 27:55.243
When I found out
about the gambling,

27:55.244 --> 27:57.375
I was just... in shock.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.147
I begged him to stop,

27:59.148 --> 28:01.149
but he just...

28:01.150 --> 28:02.781
He wouldn't.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.412
(Voice breaking) It almost
would've been easier

28:04.413 --> 28:06.314
if it had been a
woman, you know?

28:06.315 --> 28:07.685
(Chuckles)

28:07.686 --> 28:11.160
I lost my husband
to vivalapoker.Com.

28:12.962 --> 28:14.292
(Crying) I'm sorry.

28:14.293 --> 28:15.994
No, it's okay.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.766
It's just...

28:17.767 --> 28:20.398
It's what we were fighting
about the night he died.

28:20.399 --> 28:23.732
And every day I
wonder, if I just hadn't...

28:23.733 --> 28:25.373
Yelled at him about

28:25.374 --> 28:27.705
the money he was losing...

28:27.706 --> 28:29.808
Maybe he wouldn't
have taken that drive

28:29.809 --> 28:32.441
and crashed his car.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.716
I really have tried to
move on, you know?

28:38.717 --> 28:40.288
But it's just that...

28:40.289 --> 28:42.220
That question.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.752
You know, that...

28:43.753 --> 28:46.955
That question.

28:46.956 --> 28:50.258
What would've happened...

28:50.259 --> 28:52.361
If I had done
things differently?

28:56.205 --> 28:57.365
(Sniffles)

28:57.366 --> 28:59.737
(Indistinct conversations)

28:59.738 --> 29:02.270
Vivalapoker.com, look it up.

29:02.271 --> 29:03.441
Why is that?

29:03.442 --> 29:06.444
Her husband was addicted to it.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.917
And, no, she was not in on it.

29:08.918 --> 29:11.119
She's been blaming herself
for her husband's death

29:11.120 --> 29:13.121
for the last five
years. (Typing)

29:13.122 --> 29:14.983
Oh, ho, ho. The
site's still active.

29:14.984 --> 29:16.384
Yeah, this is really good news.

29:16.385 --> 29:19.427
So we can subpoena the
web site for his account activity.

29:19.428 --> 29:22.090
If he's created a new
account under a different name,

29:22.091 --> 29:24.332
we should be able
to find him. How?

29:24.333 --> 29:27.165
Well, rephrase... I
know two FBI analysts

29:27.166 --> 29:30.339
who should be able to find him.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.303
Did you tell her
her husband's alive?

29:35.304 --> 29:36.545
Nope.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.407
Why not?

29:39.408 --> 29:41.310
I want to find
the bastard first.

29:46.255 --> 29:48.156
(Typing)

29:48.157 --> 29:49.918
Okay, here's our data.

29:49.919 --> 29:52.390
Colin Olsson's betting
patterns, playing habits,

29:52.391 --> 29:54.122
chat room activity.

29:54.123 --> 29:56.364
Looks like a job for
regression analysis.

29:56.365 --> 29:57.525
(Typing)

29:57.526 --> 29:59.267
Regression analysis.

29:59.268 --> 30:01.329
Yeah, of course. Um...

30:01.330 --> 30:03.371
(Typing continues)

30:03.372 --> 30:05.403
How long's that
gonna take? Not long.

30:05.404 --> 30:08.406
(Typing continues)

30:08.407 --> 30:10.008
We got him.

30:10.009 --> 30:13.081
Colin Olsson now plays under
the user name phoenix2008.

30:13.082 --> 30:16.414
F-Five years ago, he
Rose from the ashes.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.416
That is cute.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.288
I'm guessing George
Washington isn't his real name.

30:20.289 --> 30:23.451
But his I.P. Address
is registered to...

30:23.452 --> 30:25.153
(Taps button)

30:25.154 --> 30:26.955
Alec Hamilton of San Diego.

30:26.956 --> 30:28.396
Okay, can you
check local hotels?

30:28.397 --> 30:30.598
Sure.

30:30.599 --> 30:33.532
(Both typing rapidly)

30:39.568 --> 30:41.970
Ah. Alec Hamilton checked in to

30:41.971 --> 30:43.271
the olympian hotel
on market street

30:43.272 --> 30:44.913
a little over one month ago.

30:44.914 --> 30:48.076
Thank you. You
ladies are awesome.

30:48.077 --> 30:50.218
Yes, we are. (Chuckles)

30:50.219 --> 30:51.951
(Taps button)

31:05.034 --> 31:06.635
(Tommy) Philly
p.D. Anybody here?

31:10.199 --> 31:11.440
Closet clear.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.206
Bathroom clear.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.079
(Holsters gun)

31:21.080 --> 31:22.410
(Sighs, holsters gun)

31:22.411 --> 31:23.953
He's not here.

31:32.561 --> 31:34.362
Look at this guy.

31:34.363 --> 31:37.466
Death's the best thing
that ever happened to him.

31:39.668 --> 31:41.029
You know, I don't get it.

31:41.030 --> 31:42.370
These were taken way before

31:42.371 --> 31:43.901
Gerry Roberts ever
got himself into trouble.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.673
(Exhales)

31:45.674 --> 31:48.206
You know, I think we've been
looking at this the wrong way.

31:48.207 --> 31:50.678
Roberts didn't find
Olsson. Olsson found him.

31:50.679 --> 31:53.041
Mr. Fake your death
here has found himself

31:53.042 --> 31:54.212
a little niche industry.

31:54.213 --> 31:55.513
You find a rich
guy who's in a jam,

31:55.514 --> 31:59.087
offer to disappear
him for a fee.

31:59.088 --> 32:00.248
Well, he must have

32:00.249 --> 32:02.521
a whole network
of people involved.

32:05.094 --> 32:06.354
(Beep) (Chuckles)

32:06.355 --> 32:08.027
Would've been too easy, huh?

32:10.399 --> 32:12.030
Philly p.D. Don't move.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.233
Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Stop, stop, stop. (Grunts)

32:16.435 --> 32:19.507
(Both grunting)

32:19.508 --> 32:21.039
(Moans)

32:21.040 --> 32:22.570
(Grunts)

32:22.571 --> 32:24.072
(Handcuffs click)

32:24.073 --> 32:26.075
So where's Gerry Roberts?

32:27.476 --> 32:28.447
The clock is ticking.

32:28.448 --> 32:29.978
He's about to go under the knife

32:29.979 --> 32:31.949
if he hasn't already.

32:31.950 --> 32:35.523
Look, you got the wrong
guy. My name is Alec Hamilton.

32:35.524 --> 32:37.385
Right. You used to
be John Anderson.

32:37.386 --> 32:40.328
Your name is Colin Olsson.
You're a forensic pathologist.

32:40.329 --> 32:42.290
You tried to fake your
own death five years ago.

32:42.291 --> 32:45.163
You know the m.E.O. Has
got a swab of your d.N.A.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.494
From Jennifer Sanchez's lips

32:46.495 --> 32:48.436
after you tired to
give her c.P.R., right?

32:48.437 --> 32:50.968
Remember that?

32:50.969 --> 32:53.271
We have you dead
to rights, doctor.

32:53.272 --> 32:55.303
So why'd you help her anyway?

32:55.304 --> 32:57.305
Did you feel guilty?

32:57.306 --> 33:00.348
You just didn't want to go down
for second-degree murder? What?

33:00.349 --> 33:01.310
Look, you know, I
may be many things,

33:01.311 --> 33:02.650
but I am not a murderer.

33:02.651 --> 33:04.382
I'm a doctor. She went
down right in front of me.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.084
I couldn't just do nothing.

33:06.085 --> 33:09.457
Right. So you're a mastermind
with a heart of gold, right?

33:09.458 --> 33:10.988
Well...

33:10.989 --> 33:12.460
Everybody except when it
comes to your wife, right?

33:12.461 --> 33:14.162
My wife? You talked to my wife?

33:14.163 --> 33:16.164
Yeah, I did talk to
your wife. Mm-hmm.

33:16.165 --> 33:17.465
She's still broken up over you.

33:17.466 --> 33:19.497
Right, Adam? Mm-hmm.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.400
Listen, she still feels
responsible for your death.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.202
Does that bother you at all?

33:24.203 --> 33:26.334
Look...

33:26.335 --> 33:28.176
(Exhales)

33:28.177 --> 33:30.108
Y-You... you gotta understand.

33:30.109 --> 33:33.141
I... I was about
to go to prison.

33:33.142 --> 33:34.312
Oh, okay.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.383
My life was over.

33:35.384 --> 33:37.645
Faking my death
was the only way out.

33:37.646 --> 33:39.287
It was a coward's way out.

33:39.288 --> 33:40.688
No, it was a brilliant way out.

33:40.689 --> 33:42.390
And it turns out
there's plenty of people

33:42.391 --> 33:43.691
who would pay to do the same.

33:43.692 --> 33:45.753
And that's what I do. I give
people a second chance.

33:45.754 --> 33:47.355
You give people a second chance?

33:47.356 --> 33:48.656
Yeah, that's what I do.

33:48.657 --> 33:50.728
What about the guy who
you torched in the car?

33:50.729 --> 33:52.500
Were you giving him
a second chance?

33:52.501 --> 33:54.202
You know, that was a
medical school cadaver.

33:54.203 --> 33:56.104
And I have never
murdered anybody.

33:56.105 --> 33:57.335
What about Jennifer Sanchez?

33:57.336 --> 33:58.806
That was an accident.

33:58.807 --> 34:00.168
Right now there's
a crime lab team

34:00.169 --> 34:01.409
hacking into your computer.

34:01.410 --> 34:02.410
I'm just guessing
they're gonna find

34:02.411 --> 34:04.242
a client list,
surgeons, dentists...

34:04.243 --> 34:07.145
Everybody else involved in
your crappy little operation.

34:07.146 --> 34:09.547
You cooperate now, the d.A.
Is gonna cut you some slack.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.519
If you don't, we don't
need you anymore...

34:11.520 --> 34:14.051
(Chuckles) They're gonna Chuck
you out to general population.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.554
That, Colin, is where
the real killers are?

34:16.555 --> 34:20.188
Do you want to be there, huh?

34:20.189 --> 34:22.461
You're the gambler.
What's it gonna be, doc?

34:40.509 --> 34:42.511
(Door creaks)

34:57.166 --> 34:58.567
Shh. Shh.

34:59.828 --> 35:03.502
(Lowered voice)
Okay. Let's go, guys.

35:10.179 --> 35:13.411
Not a sound.
You're the first to go.

35:13.412 --> 35:15.584
Hands where I can see 'em, guys.

35:19.548 --> 35:20.588
Hey.

35:20.589 --> 35:23.692
Megan, we're in.
(Handcuffs clicking)

35:28.697 --> 35:30.728
Did he go under yet?

35:30.729 --> 35:33.402
Let's find out.

35:45.414 --> 35:46.814
(Gerry exhales) Hey, doc.

35:46.815 --> 35:48.476
I don't care what my
coagulation panel says.

35:48.477 --> 35:50.448
We have to do this now.

35:50.449 --> 35:52.180
You should care.

35:52.181 --> 35:54.352
If your clotting factor's
low, you could hemorrhage.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.454
It's really not a good
thing during surgery.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.555
Who the hell are you?

35:57.556 --> 35:59.457
Dr. Megan hunt.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.429
You look okay for a dead man.

36:01.430 --> 36:03.491
Long time no see, Gerry.

36:03.492 --> 36:04.792
(Clinks) Not the, uh, wrist wear

36:04.793 --> 36:06.894
you're accustomed
to wearing, I imagine.

36:06.895 --> 36:08.936
You're going
back to trial, Jerry.

36:08.937 --> 36:11.669
There's no way you're getting
out of this one. I promise you.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.801
One thing you forgot, detective.

36:13.802 --> 36:16.704
No one knows where
the money is except me.

36:16.705 --> 36:19.507
I'll plead it out in
exchange for a deal.

36:19.508 --> 36:22.410
Yeah, you may
want to think again.

36:22.411 --> 36:24.412
This is a list from
Olsson's computer

36:24.413 --> 36:26.884
of all the client's he's helped
disappear over the years.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.516
We got the new identities...
Oh, including yours...

36:28.517 --> 36:30.688
John baker Ashton.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.360
(Tommy) The d.A.'S
already issued a subpoena

36:32.361 --> 36:34.362
to the first Caribbean
bank of Belize,

36:34.363 --> 36:36.294
all accounts in that name.

36:36.295 --> 36:37.595
How much you
want to bet they find

36:37.596 --> 36:39.297
all the money you stashed away?

36:39.298 --> 36:41.529
(Megan) You're
out of options, Gerry.

36:41.530 --> 36:43.531
And by the way, after
you stand trial for fraud,

36:43.532 --> 36:46.904
you will stand trial for the
death of Jennifer Sanchez.

36:46.905 --> 36:49.438
Who the hell is
Jennifer Sanchez?

36:50.739 --> 36:53.211
Exactly.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.546
Nice work, Megan.

36:58.547 --> 37:00.588
What are you doing here?

37:00.589 --> 37:03.551
Complimenting you.
Don't get used to it.

37:03.552 --> 37:04.523
(Laughs) Yeah.

37:04.524 --> 37:06.224
(Laughs)

37:17.506 --> 37:19.006
And why are you two smiling?

37:19.007 --> 37:20.868
Well, we got Roberts.

37:20.869 --> 37:22.870
We got a line on the money
he stole from investors.

37:22.871 --> 37:24.872
It's a good day
for the department.

37:24.873 --> 37:27.315
Stop patting
yourselves on the back.

37:27.316 --> 37:28.776
None of this would've
been necessary

37:28.777 --> 37:30.778
if you had done your
jobs in the first place.

37:30.779 --> 37:32.480
(Megan) Excuse me.

37:32.481 --> 37:33.481
They did do their job.

37:33.482 --> 37:35.553
Roberts is in custody.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.355
You have nothing
to complain about.

37:37.356 --> 37:38.986
This your idea of
keeping your people

37:38.987 --> 37:40.589
on a tighter leash?

37:42.461 --> 37:44.562
Megan, detectives,
I think the chief and I

37:44.563 --> 37:46.295
need to have another chat.

37:49.538 --> 37:51.299
Angela, I would never presume

37:51.300 --> 37:53.571
to tell you how to
discipline your people.

37:53.572 --> 37:54.902
Good. But as far
as I'm concerned,

37:54.903 --> 37:57.004
this was a perfect example
of our two departments

37:57.005 --> 37:59.046
cooperating to solve a case.

37:59.047 --> 38:00.608
I'd much rather a
few feathers get ruffled

38:00.609 --> 38:01.779
than lose our initiative.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.381
So do I cut Megan
a lot of slack?

38:03.382 --> 38:06.354
Yes, because time
after time, she's earned it.

38:06.355 --> 38:07.955
And I have no intention
of reining her in.

38:07.956 --> 38:09.457
Now, Kate,

38:09.458 --> 38:10.758
you are an aspiring politician.

38:10.759 --> 38:12.760
You know you should
never take a position

38:12.761 --> 38:14.822
that you can't walk back

38:14.823 --> 38:17.925
when your
supporters tell you to.

38:17.926 --> 38:20.498
You're right. I
should know better.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.800
So here's another
position I can't walk back...

38:22.801 --> 38:24.502
You can keep your endorsement.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.475
I'll take my chances without it.

38:31.780 --> 38:34.783
(Telephone ringing)

38:39.418 --> 38:40.588
Hi.

38:40.589 --> 38:42.790
I got your message.
What's going on?

38:42.791 --> 38:46.454
I have some news for
you about your husband.

38:46.455 --> 38:48.526
What news?

38:48.527 --> 38:50.898
What happened to him...

38:50.899 --> 38:52.600
It's not your fault.

38:52.601 --> 38:55.363
Oh, well, that's
very kind, but you...

38:55.364 --> 38:56.634
No, I-I really mean it.

38:56.635 --> 38:59.968
It's really not your fault.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.572
(Sighs)

39:04.573 --> 39:06.073
(Chuckles)

39:06.074 --> 39:07.875
Your husband's alive.

39:07.876 --> 39:09.346
No, but... but...

39:09.347 --> 39:10.548
Ruth... but they told me that...

39:10.549 --> 39:12.921
Don't you want
to know the truth?

39:15.484 --> 39:19.056
(Elevator bell dings)

39:19.057 --> 39:20.729
(Footstep echoes)

39:25.664 --> 39:29.067
(Indistinct conversations)

39:37.045 --> 39:39.046
Oh, my god.

39:39.047 --> 39:40.408
(Voice breaks) Colin?

39:40.409 --> 39:41.979
Colin?

39:41.980 --> 39:44.512
You son of a bitch!

39:44.513 --> 39:46.614
You're alive?!

39:46.615 --> 39:47.615
I'm sorry.

39:47.616 --> 39:49.487
You're sorry?!

39:49.488 --> 39:51.519
Okay. Okay, okay,
let's go. You're sorry?!

39:51.520 --> 39:54.021
(Sobs) Oh, my...

39:54.022 --> 39:56.624
Don't, please.

39:56.625 --> 39:59.067
(Exhales deeply)

40:06.104 --> 40:07.975
She'll be okay, right?

40:07.976 --> 40:11.709
Yeah, I think.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.541
I mean, it's better
she finds out this way

40:13.542 --> 40:15.543
than the front page
of a newspaper.

40:15.544 --> 40:17.545
Mm-hmm.

40:17.546 --> 40:20.988
Anyway, you're the
one I'm worried about.

40:20.989 --> 40:23.491
Me? (Chuckles) Why me?

40:23.492 --> 40:26.524
The lab results from
your father's suicide note.

40:26.525 --> 40:28.425
They come in tonight.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.028
Good.

40:31.500 --> 40:34.201
Megan...

40:34.202 --> 40:36.564
You might not get
the answer you want.

40:36.565 --> 40:40.609
All I want is the truth.

41:13.572 --> 41:14.843
(Knock on door)

41:32.521 --> 41:34.522
Here it is.

41:34.523 --> 41:35.623
What's it say?

41:35.624 --> 41:36.824
You want to sit down?

41:36.825 --> 41:39.797
Tommy, what's it say?

41:39.798 --> 41:41.799
Now don't jump to conclusions.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.271
There could be a variety
of explanations here.

41:44.272 --> 41:45.873
(Exhales)

41:45.874 --> 41:48.536
Found a foreign fingerprint.

41:48.537 --> 41:50.638
It's not my father's,
not my mother's.

41:50.639 --> 41:53.010
Look, Megan, it's
a partial fingerprint.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.542
Could be one of
your father's patients,

41:54.543 --> 41:56.013
a cleaning lady, a
friend paying a visit.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.645
It could be anybody.

41:57.646 --> 42:00.749
Oh, I know whose
fingerprint it is.

42:02.150 --> 42:04.521
It's my father's killer.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.824
(Inhales)
