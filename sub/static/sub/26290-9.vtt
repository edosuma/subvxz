03:33.387 --> 03:35.127
- Your husband will explain
all of that,

03:35.171 --> 03:36.912
but for now,
all you need to know

03:36.955 --> 03:39.175

extradited from Mexico.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.591
Cruz's testimony was expected
to put them away.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.941
- Oh, yeah, Cruz was
a strong witness,

go searching for motive.

13:59.577 --> 14:01.405
Bridge team, up top!
We clear?

14:01.449 --> 14:03.538

We're empty, all clear.

Vincent Marino.

14:24.124 --> 14:26.256

him how he tracked down Cruz?

14:35.396 --> 14:37.789
- Vincent Marino,
amateur paparazzi

14:37.833 --> 14:39.269
turned blackmail artist.

14:39.313 --> 14:40.880
- Yeah, the kinda guy
who makes a living

14:40.923 --> 14:42.925
collecting hush money
from divorce attorneys

14:42.969 --> 14:44.448
and clients with things
to hide.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.407
- Makes sense given
what we found.

14:46.450 --> 14:49.932
His cell phone, laptop,
SD cards are all missing.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.803
- GPS trackers
and surveillance equipment

14:51.847 --> 14:53.196
all over this place.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.806
This guy was
a professional scumbag.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.591
- His record agrees.

14:56.634 --> 14:59.768
Multiple stints in jail
for extortion, blackmail.

15:01.335 --> 15:02.771
- Not as far as I can tell.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.338
- Well, he's an equal
opportunity offender.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.166
How long's he been dead?

15:06.209 --> 15:07.776
- M.E. just took the body.
They think about a week.

15:07.819 --> 15:10.474
GSW to the head,
pillow used as a silencer.

15:10.518 --> 15:11.954
- No sign of forced entry,

15:11.998 --> 15:13.782
so Marino probably knew
his killer.

15:13.825 --> 15:15.784
- So maybe our boy Ernesto

15:15.827 --> 15:17.829
got Cruz's new identity
from Marino

15:17.873 --> 15:19.266
and then killed him to tie up
loose ends.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.094
- Ernesto's a pro.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.096
There's no way he'd lead us
back to the body he killed.

15:23.139 --> 15:25.489
- Plus he has an alibi.
He was in Miami

15:25.533 --> 15:26.926
around Marino's time of death.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.492
- OA.

15:28.536 --> 15:31.931
- Marino and a WITSEC witness
are both dead.

15:31.974 --> 15:35.282
We need to find out how Marino
got Cruz's protected location.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.153
- Start with the people
Marino worked with.

15:38.285 --> 15:40.896
- "William Dean,
Private Investigator."

15:42.767 --> 15:45.509
Looks like they met last week.

15:45.553 --> 15:48.643
- Marino and I had
a falling out a while back.

15:48.686 --> 15:51.211
Hired him to take photos
of my client's wife

15:51.254 --> 15:53.343
in flagrante delicto.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.998
He ended up blackmailing
the wife for sex.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.565
- When's the last time
you saw him?

15:57.608 --> 16:00.263
- Two weeks ago,
came by to apologize.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.004
Said he was "making amends"

16:02.048 --> 16:03.571
for folks he'd wronged
in the past.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.268
- When you were working
with him,

16:05.312 --> 16:07.749
did any of your cases involve
the Jairo Cartel?

16:10.665 --> 16:12.884
- I've dealt with
some dangerous characters,

16:12.928 --> 16:14.451
but never them.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.279
- You know any of Marino's
other business associates?

16:16.323 --> 16:18.281
- No, but he did mention
some guy that was

16:18.325 --> 16:20.457
gonna make him a very rich man.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.809
- No, but believe me,
if it was gonna make him rich,

16:24.853 --> 16:26.463
sure as hell wasn't legal.

16:26.507 --> 16:29.466
If you'll excuse me, I gotta
keep an eye on these two.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.604
- Making amends
to those he'd wronged?

16:36.647 --> 16:38.127
Sounds like Marino might have
been working through

16:38.171 --> 16:39.824
the ninth step
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.522
- While still working
his blackmail business

16:41.565 --> 16:43.219
on the side.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.047
- Okay, so, maybe Marino's
new business connection

16:45.091 --> 16:47.876
killed him after they sold
Cruz's location to the cartel.

16:47.919 --> 16:51.053
His partner probably knows
how Marino got that intel.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.968
- So, Marino's phone records
just came in...

16:54.056 --> 16:55.275
- His most frequent calls

16:55.318 --> 16:56.928
were to and from
an Amber Turner.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.582
In fact, she's the only person
he spoke to

16:58.626 --> 17:00.497
for more than five minutes
at a time.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.238
- Could be a girlfriend.

17:02.282 --> 17:03.935
- Could be his AA sponsor.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.286
- Crossing genders between
sponsors and sponsees

17:06.329 --> 17:07.374
is pretty unusual.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.984
- Whatever Amber was to Marino,

17:09.028 --> 17:11.291
right now, she's our best
and only lead.

17:11.334 --> 17:12.466
- We'll check her out.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.730
- I can't believe that
he's dead.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.862
- What was your relationship
with Vincent Marino?

17:17.906 --> 17:19.777
Were you two involved?

17:28.830 --> 17:32.094
- My dad was an ex-con,
so I know better than

17:32.138 --> 17:34.096
to get involved with one.

17:34.140 --> 17:38.187
Besides, I'm not at a point
in my sobriety

17:38.231 --> 17:39.623
where I'm ready for
a relationship.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.496
- Sobriety--was Marino
your AA sponsor?

17:43.888 --> 17:45.542
- No, I was his.

17:47.849 --> 17:50.330
- Usually, but Vincent asked,

17:50.373 --> 17:53.289
and AA saved my life.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.291
I was taught never to say no
to a program request.

17:55.335 --> 17:58.468
- Did you two ever talk about
Marino's professional life?

17:58.512 --> 18:00.601
Did he mention a partner
or any business deals?

18:00.644 --> 18:04.126
- No, we hadn't been working
together for very long.

18:04.170 --> 18:06.824
We focused on working
the steps,

18:06.868 --> 18:09.175

18:10.741 --> 18:12.221
Most people aren't.

18:14.223 --> 18:17.400
- So, AA Amber was a dead end,
but Maggie and OA think

18:17.444 --> 18:19.054
there's something hinky
about her.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.708

something hinky going on

found this.

18:25.321 --> 18:26.714
That's Amber.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.063
Marino sent this to
a photo editor

if he could lighten it enough
to see the man's face.

do it for even triple the rate.

18:35.418 --> 18:38.247

his AA sponsor.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.379

He started stalking me,

29:31.552 --> 29:34.511
taking pictures of me

29:34.555 --> 29:38.515
So, when Paul confronted him

32:33.516 --> 32:35.344

with Ackerman

32:35.388 --> 32:37.607

but 15th Street Gang
was listening to her calls.

39:48.995 --> 39:53.173
But the thing is, is that these
people were being so careful.

39:53.216 --> 39:56.481
- Doesn't make what happened
to Curtis any less tragic.

39:56.524 --> 39:59.048
- No.

40:01.268 --> 40:03.923
- Would you still encourage
people to go into the program?

40:03.966 --> 40:06.752
- Without a doubt.

40:06.795 --> 40:10.103
- So I need you to go back.
I need you to look at it again.

40:13.367 --> 40:16.065
- Hey.

40:16.109 --> 40:17.371
Is that the other witness
that Ackerman

40:17.415 --> 40:18.459
was in a relationship with?

40:18.503 --> 40:19.852
- Yeah, you were right.

40:19.895 --> 40:21.767
He sold her name
as a parting shot.

40:21.810 --> 40:23.464
- We have a team monitoring
her apartment.

40:23.508 --> 40:25.858
We'll bring in whoever
Ackerman sold her name to

40:25.901 --> 40:27.686
if they're dumb enough
to follow through.

40:30.253 --> 40:33.866
- Really, really good work,
both of you.

40:38.174 --> 40:39.785
- Hey, Jubal.

40:42.004 --> 40:44.703
Yeah?

40:44.746 --> 40:48.097
- I know you said not to use AA
to get Amber to talk,

40:48.141 --> 40:51.405
and I just want you to know
that I really respect

40:51.449 --> 40:54.277
that you stood your ground.

40:54.321 --> 40:56.845
I hope I didn't lose
your trust.

40:58.368 --> 41:01.763
- I said I wouldn't use it.

41:01.807 --> 41:03.983
You're not beholden
to the program, Maggie.

41:04.026 --> 41:06.899
I am.
You did what you had to do.

41:06.942 --> 41:09.162
- So we're good.

41:09.205 --> 41:10.511
- There's nothing
more important

41:10.555 --> 41:13.035
than putting the bad guys away.

41:13.079 --> 41:16.517
But, uh...

41:16.561 --> 41:20.913
Yeah, without AA,
I don't get to be a Fed.

41:22.915 --> 41:24.873
And I like being a Fed.
