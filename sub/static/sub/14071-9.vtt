could be your legacy, son.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.196
But the only way you're gonna get there

10:25.291 --> 10:28.124
is by playing with
the best quarterback in the league.

10:28.211 --> 10:31.874
And he sure as shit
ain't gonna be with the motherfucking Rams.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.960
Jason's gonna love getting this fucking call.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.131
Mmm-hmm.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.219
Time.

10:45.061 --> 10:48.770
-lt's been way past five seconds, bro.
-VERNON: You count tOO fast.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.019
Now it's five seconds.

10:52.110 --> 10:54.726
Don't try to speed up the count
'cause you're worried I'm overdoing myself.

10:54.821 --> 10:58.279
-Come on, Reg. Fuck.
-SPENCER: (STRAINING) It's okay, I got it.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.699
Oh, man.
You thinking about a career change, Vern?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.322
-Thanks for coming by, man.
-SPENCER: Sure.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.028
Hey, Reg, he got something for you, though.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.539
Yeah. We heard you're looking for capital.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.242
Jason tell you that?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.372
Man, he said you lent us
every dime you had last year.

11:12.463 --> 11:13.964
It was an investment.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.713
And so is this.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.416
My contribution to the cause.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.297
-One million dollars.
-SPENCER: Wow

11:21.181 --> 11:24.093
-I can't take this, no.
-Don't lOOk at it as a loan, man.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.391
It's payback
for all the work you've done for us

11:26.477 --> 11:28.604
and all the shit we done put you through.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.891
Me, for instance.

11:31.482 --> 11:32.813
(LAUGHS)

11:32.901 --> 11:34.857

11:34.944 --> 11:36.229
But, no.

11:36.321 --> 11:39.529
-I can't do it. Here.
-Our money nO good?

11:39.616 --> 11:41.356
NO, your money's tOO good, Okay?

11:41.451 --> 11:44.033
Which why I would never
wanna put it in jeopardy.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.112
And, plus, it's not nearly enough, so...

11:48.583 --> 11:50.699
Okay, man, so how much you want, then?

11:50.793 --> 11:52.169
I mean, name the amount.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.995
I can't do it. I appreciate the thought.

11:55.089 --> 11:59.298
Thank you both very much,
but the donation booth is Officially closed.

CHARLES: You did a paper on the Carlisle?
ANTHONY: Yeah.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.007
First federally funded Indian boarding school.

12:04.098 --> 12:07.966
Whitey wanted to Americanize the Indians,
so they taught them football.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.218
CHARLES: Pop Warner
was their coach, right?

12:10.313 --> 12:11.928
ANTHONY: You know your history.

12:12.023 --> 12:15.857
Pop turned them
into the best team in the country by 1907.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.902
They invented
the forward pass and trick plays.

12:18.988 --> 12:22.731
Okay, so you're smart
in addition to being a damn good tackle.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.361
Not good enough to get drafted.

12:24.452 --> 12:28.320
Well, your Off-the-field behavior
wrecked your senior season.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.910
Slinging weed's the fastest way
to make a dollar where I'm from.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.788
The school makes millions
off of merch and TV deals,

12:34.879 --> 12:37.461
and I'm eating
ramen fucking noodles twice a day?

12:37.548 --> 12:39.709
I did what I had to to get by.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.007
Old habits die hard, I guess.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.419
I go to meetings now.

12:44.514 --> 12:47.005
I got a sponsor,
I got better people around me.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.682
Good, 'cause I didn't come out here to bring
on another camp body.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.636
You come down to Miami,
I'll make sure that you're on the 53.

12:52.981 --> 12:55.472
We got a first-class
support system to keep you focused,

12:55.566 --> 12:56.851
namely me.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.527
Look, we only got 15 grand
to Offer as a signing bonus.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.323
But the real money comes
after you make the team.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.742
Right now, you gotta decide
if a couple more Gs up front

13:07.829 --> 13:11.413
is worth more than finding the right place
to begin your professional career.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.453
A place that won't
have you falling back into Old habits.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.045
Now, come on, I'll buy you
some ramen noodles.

-In the flesh.

Hey, Leonard drops a deuce
at exactly this time every day.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.035
You can literally set your watch to it.

13:55.126 --> 13:58.209
I did set my watch to it.
That's how I got up here.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.129
I'd like to buy the company, Mr. Anderson.

14:04.635 --> 14:05.841
-Would you?
-Very much.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.886
What could have possibly given you the idea

14:09.474 --> 14:11.089
that I was taking new offers?

14:11.225 --> 14:15.935
Oh, I see, fuck me for doing myjob
and creating a bidding war that gets you paid.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.694
(SNIFFING)

14:34.123 --> 14:36.580
(LAUGHING)

14:37.668 --> 14:39.408
That is a million dollars in a bag.

14:39.504 --> 14:42.917
Mr. Anderson, you asked us
tO build this division,

14:43.007 --> 14:44.383
and that's exactly what we did.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.958
But in the process, we created a family here.

14:47.470 --> 14:50.382
You got a group Of people
who love to come to work every morning

14:50.473 --> 14:53.556
and who are driven
to continue building this entire firm.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.679
Sure, we hit a few bumps along the way,

14:55.770 --> 14:57.726
but we got something special here
and you know it.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.647
JOE: Would you rather
sell to the guy who's trying to play you

15:00.733 --> 15:02.143
or the guy who used to play for you?

15:02.819 --> 15:05.606
You know what, I can't
tell the difference anymore

15:05.696 --> 15:08.688
and I think you're overstating
my attachment to this company.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.775
NO, he's not. You love the action.

15:12.203 --> 15:13.784
You love the way we look after our guys.

15:13.871 --> 15:17.329
It's the reason why you supported us
while we were trying to find our feet.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.703
Mr. Anderson, take that million dollars in cash

15:19.794 --> 15:21.830
as a non-refundable down payment

15:21.921 --> 15:24.412
and give me the Opportunity
to bring you the rest.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.331
I'm not giving you
former employee discounts.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.634
I don't expect one.
Ijust want to be in the game.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.305
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

You go out and you rob
a few more Brink's trucks,

15:41.482 --> 15:43.939
you bring me the full asking price,

15:44.026 --> 15:47.109
we can sit down and talk about making a deal.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.359
And on your way out,
please tell Leonard he's fired.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.457
SO, back to the second quarter.

16:01.544 --> 16:05.082
If I were you, I wouldn't
say a word for a while.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.755
And I didn't even have
to use the full 20 grand.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.457
Nicely done.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.713
Yeah. Anthony's a good kid.

Be careful about getting tOO attached.

-I think I got an allergy.

16:22.231 --> 16:25.439
-Feels like I got attacked by mosquitoes.
-You got hives.

-Hives? NO.
-Welcome to the front office.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.070
Something going on at home?

16:32.158 --> 16:33.944
NO, we just wanted something easier
on the environment.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.775
I'm not talking about your laundry, Charles.

16:35.870 --> 16:38.486
Balancing a newjob with a new baby,
that's a big adjustment.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.365
I guess Julie has been
a bit more hot-tempered than usual.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.041
Didn't think I'd be working this much.

what I'm doing, up to the hour.

in this job, Charles,

Ah, you know,
it's still smaller than a cantaloupe.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.629

who's trying to sabotage my career,

so coming in for surgery
doesn't really gel with my calendar right now.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.935

a pulmonary embolism to get you in here?

if I was gonna drop dead,

and schedule it for my 65th birthday,

I should need the surgery.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.410
He's great at scrambling,

to improvise and create big plays.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.256

on his back this season,

18:57.428 --> 18:58.668

Yeah, well improvising
is what you got shipped out.

would give you a shot

that I advised you to invest $600,000,

21:07.308 --> 21:09.344
not $6 million into this deal.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.675
And if that deal would have panned out,

21:10.770 --> 21:12.635
you would have made
very good money, Okay?

21:12.730 --> 21:13.845
And if it failed, which it did,

21:13.939 --> 21:17.431
you still would have had over $5 million
to put into another Opportunity.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.943
But only a crazy man
puts all Of his money into one single deal!

21:21.030 --> 21:22.611
Yes, and only an asshole would let him.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.780
Even I didn't have the power
to stop you back then.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.198
I mean, you wouldn't
even listen to your coach.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.525
You were gonna listen to me?

21:27.620 --> 21:29.076
You knew I had a player's mentality back then

21:29.163 --> 21:31.825
and you also knew, Andre,
if everything went south,

21:31.916 --> 21:34.783
like this whole fucking deal went
south, I wasn't gonna back out.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.333
That's not how I thought back then.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.456
NO, I was gonna dig in even fucking deeper.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.914
Did I tell you to bring all those people
into the deal, including your friends?

21:42.343 --> 21:44.755
Sometimes in life
you just have to let things bottom out,

21:44.845 --> 21:46.631
and then you start anew. LOOk at you know.

21:46.722 --> 21:50.465
That's why I think it's important for me
and you to work together again.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.811
Now, Miami Wealth
does not need your services,

21:52.895 --> 21:55.307
but ASM does,
and I'm gonna buy that company.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.103
And I want to put you in charge,

21:57.191 --> 21:59.147
and you can retain Joe and your staff,

21:59.235 --> 22:01.476
and I'm gonna kick you
all of my football clients.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.110
But more importantly,

22:03.197 --> 22:05.358
I'm gonna
get you that blessing from the NFLPA.

22:10.454 --> 22:11.694
I1Ipass.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.325
Come on, Spence.

22:14.416 --> 22:17.704
You can't let your pride derail you
of making the right decision again.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.205
I can get you anything you want.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.839
I can get it myself.

22:20.923 --> 22:22.208
I don't need you to get it for me.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.164
How you gonna hunt down $15 million?

22:24.260 --> 22:26.876
None Of your goddamn business
where I'm gonna get it from. I'll get it.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.507
Tell me you're not gonna get it
from your clients.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.306
Spence, that is the reason why me
and you are in this mess.

22:33.394 --> 22:34.554
Please, do anything but that.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.101
I'm not like you.

22:37.106 --> 22:39.142
You're exactly like me.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.598
Not like you.

22:49.451 --> 22:50.827
JULIE: Bzz!

22:52.037 --> 22:53.868
Ladybug? Are you a ladybug?

22:53.956 --> 22:55.537
-My little lady...
-Hey, girls!

22:55.624 --> 22:58.115
-Daddy's home!
-Hey, Daddy!

22:58.210 --> 22:59.450
Oh, look at that.

23:00.462 --> 23:01.451
Who's this?

23:01.547 --> 23:03.458
Oh, this is Manny, the new nanny.

23:03.549 --> 23:06.006
You told me to get some help, so I did.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.628
MANNY: Charles, nice to meet you.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.220
-I was just getting to know Kiki. She's so cute.
-Mmm-hmm.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.343
-She is so cute.
-TOO cute.

23:13.809 --> 23:16.391
-Ju|ie, can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure. Could you excuse us, Manny?

23:16.478 --> 23:17.934
Of course, Of course. Take your time.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.387

-(WHISPERS) Lower your voice.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.060
You hired this dude
without even talking to me?

23:26.155 --> 23:29.443
He has a ton Of experience
and was highly recommended by the hospital.

23:29.533 --> 23:30.739
And when did you want me to run it by you?

23:30.826 --> 23:32.066
-I was gone one night.
-You know what?

23:32.161 --> 23:34.322
I checked the ticket prices
and they skyrocketed!

23:34.622 --> 23:36.078
(SIGHS) I...

23:36.165 --> 23:38.577
You know, I'm not gonna
make it to San Francisco.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.168
-What?
-Siefert said they overlap with OTAs.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.789
Siefert said? You know what? Fine.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.416
We'll go without you.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.705
You're going with him?

23:49.011 --> 23:51.468
Aw, look at the little bib.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.420
-She's adorable.
-My "widdle-widdle."

23:53.515 --> 23:55.130
You know, Manny, she really likes you.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.431
MANNY: She does, she does.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.179
JULIE: Yeah, you like Manny, baby?

23:58.270 --> 24:00.101
MANNY: He's a keeper.
JULIE: He's a keeper.

REGGIE: I'm calling PETA.

24:06.195 --> 24:07.981
This shit is nasty.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.067
Don't blame Little Plug for human error.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.524
A human didn't create
this mess Ijust cleaned up.

24:17.247 --> 24:19.158
He didn't mean it. Good boy!

24:19.583 --> 24:20.868
It's Okay.

24:21.669 --> 24:24.035
Reggie, he gonna clean that stuff up, not me.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.040
REGGIE: Look who's back.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.673
Urn, did you happen
to leave a bag Of carrots by the TV?

24:29.760 --> 24:32.172
Why would I come over here
with a bag Of carrots?

24:32.262 --> 24:33.968
Just process Of elimination.

24:34.056 --> 24:36.138
Hey, yo, Vern, man, Spencer's here.

24:36.225 --> 24:38.090
VERNON: Did he bring
the carrots over before?

24:38.185 --> 24:40.176
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Nah, he clean. Had to be Nate, the big ass.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.726
-He on a diet.
-VERNON: Yeah, that's true.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.930
REGGIE: Plug ate a bag Of carrots
and threw up all over the damn couch.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.685
Here you go.

24:45.776 --> 24:47.937
SO, uh, what's up?

24:48.654 --> 24:51.646
Well, the donation booth hasjust reopened,

24:51.740 --> 24:54.072
so I'm gonna need you
to grab that checkbook.

24:57.079 --> 25:00.116
-All good, man.
-Okay, I got it.

25:00.582 --> 25:01.742
I need you to know it's a risk.

25:02.292 --> 25:03.828
Only way to reap the reward, right?

25:04.086 --> 25:06.828
Hey, I'm serious, Vernon.
It's not a sure thing you're gonna play again.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.787
-Come on, Spence.
-I believe you will.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.497
lt'sjust not a sure thing, all right?

25:10.592 --> 25:13.174
I'm gonna do everything
I can to pay you back.

25:13.262 --> 25:14.968
I just can't guarantee it.

25:15.097 --> 25:16.303
And I need you to be clear on that.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.639
Might not play again,
might not see my money back.
