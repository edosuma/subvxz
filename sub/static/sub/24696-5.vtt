00:33.503 --> 00:35.771
Loy, these have to get
to the cellar right away.

00:35.772 --> 00:39.708
I wish you could join us.
- I wish you could join me.

00:39.709 --> 00:41.510
- I may go out afterwards.

00:41.511 --> 00:43.662
- Oh.
- Mm.

00:43.663 --> 00:45.246
- Okay.

00:47.616 --> 00:49.785
Oh...

00:49.786 --> 00:52.288
Happy anniversary.

00:52.289 --> 00:54.824
- It's a week away.
- Well, there's more to come.

00:54.825 --> 00:56.258
You've been working so hard.

00:56.259 --> 00:59.962
Open it after
your shoot tonight.

01:00.463 --> 01:02.898
You... are so sweet.

01:08.805 --> 01:10.505
- Yeah, I like that one
in blue.

01:13.243 --> 01:16.879
- Aren't you beautiful?

01:16.880 --> 01:18.314
- Mr. bing.

01:18.315 --> 01:20.716
Should I put the others
in the walk-in, sir?

01:20.717 --> 01:23.986
- Not yet, loy.
Our guests are almost here.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.659
- You've been gone an hour.
Where did you go?

02:03.660 --> 02:06.628
- Can you give me a lift home?

02:46.836 --> 02:48.137
- Oh!

02:48.138 --> 02:50.806
Ugh!
Oh!

02:50.807 --> 02:53.342
Help me!

02:53.343 --> 02:55.978
Help!

02:55.979 --> 02:58.947
Help!
Help!

<b>Adriano_csi
www.Addic7ed.Com</b>

03:45.119 --> 03:47.719
wine Porter,
bing Cullman 56.

03:47.720 --> 03:48.887
Probable coronary.

03:48.888 --> 03:51.757
Butler found him 9:00 am
in the wine cooler.

03:51.758 --> 03:53.192
- And they need
major case because...?

03:53.193 --> 03:55.494
- Mr. Cullman advised the mayor
on his wine acquisitions.

03:55.495 --> 03:58.230
The wife, Avery,
is an advertising executive.

03:58.231 --> 04:00.198
We kept her upstairs.

04:02.501 --> 04:05.270
- Nice cellar.
Someone cleaned.

04:05.271 --> 04:07.906
- The Butler did it.
Last night.

04:07.907 --> 04:10.008
Says he left at 11:00 p.M.,

04:10.009 --> 04:13.245
Mr. bing was having a cigar
in the back garden.

04:16.182 --> 04:18.350
- Got a bilateral
crease on his earlobe.

04:18.351 --> 04:20.519
That's consistent
with cardiovascular disease.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.354
- Wine spatter.

04:22.355 --> 04:24.990
He dropped his glass
when he fell.

04:24.991 --> 04:28.927
And he's
got a safe up there.

04:31.163 --> 04:34.499
Open...

04:34.500 --> 04:36.501
And empty.

04:36.502 --> 04:41.607
- I smell cigars...
Wine, sweat.

04:41.608 --> 04:44.977
See these scrapes
on his pinky knuckles?

04:44.978 --> 04:47.579
Both sides.
And nail marks in his palms.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.415
Clenching his fists
like he...

04:50.416 --> 04:52.651
You know, was
banging against the door.

04:52.652 --> 04:54.620
- He panicked?

04:54.621 --> 04:57.589
Still, it seems to easily
open from the inside.

04:59.358 --> 05:02.294
Unless...

05:04.930 --> 05:06.197
It was locked
from the outside.

05:08.634 --> 05:10.669
- Bing gave a wine tasting,

05:10.670 --> 05:12.904
and I had a photo shoot
in Chelsea.

05:12.905 --> 05:14.940
- Last night,
what time did you come home?

05:14.941 --> 05:15.941
- Around 11:00.

05:15.942 --> 05:19.111
Right after the wrap.

05:19.112 --> 05:21.280
I assumed that
he was in the cellar,

05:21.281 --> 05:22.381
and I went to bed.

05:22.382 --> 05:24.516
And then this morning,
when I woke up,

05:24.517 --> 05:28.020
he wasn't there.

05:28.021 --> 05:30.589
And then loy found him.

05:30.590 --> 05:32.557
- Did he have
any health problems?

05:32.558 --> 05:35.060
- I mean, the usual
for men of his age.

05:35.061 --> 05:37.562
High blood pressure,
gout...

05:37.563 --> 05:40.565
- Heart trouble?
- Yeah.

05:40.566 --> 05:42.434
- We'll need
a list of his meds.

05:44.771 --> 05:48.140
- You said that
you went right to bed.

05:48.141 --> 05:51.076
Is that your
usual schedule?

05:51.077 --> 05:52.978
- We were in
a long term marriage.

05:52.979 --> 05:55.681
And we loved each other.

05:55.682 --> 05:59.451
Was it perfect?

05:59.452 --> 06:01.219
It was better than most.

06:01.220 --> 06:03.622
- Okay.

06:03.623 --> 06:06.625
Thanks for your candor.

06:06.626 --> 06:10.662
- I went in and
saw him on the ground.

06:10.663 --> 06:12.264
- Loy...

06:12.265 --> 06:16.001
Last night, you said
it was a special tasting?

06:17.837 --> 06:19.805
One of the vintages
was so rare,

06:19.806 --> 06:23.008
Mr. ng had it delivered
by armored car.

06:23.009 --> 06:24.076
- How many ces?

06:24.077 --> 06:26.111
- Just six bottles.

06:26.112 --> 06:28.246
- Did you
know all the guests?

06:28.247 --> 06:30.415
- Mr. ev.

06:30.416 --> 06:32.351
Dilahunt.

06:32.352 --> 06:33.685
And two other guests.

06:33.686 --> 06:37.289
I don't remember
their names, I'm sorry.

06:37.290 --> 06:38.657
Mr. bing sells his wine

06:38.658 --> 06:41.626
through Mr. Dilahunt's
auction house.

06:45.331 --> 06:48.900
- 1775, chateau de tour.

06:48.901 --> 06:51.536
Brilliant color,
almost no oxidation.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.638
It was acolossuscollossus,
my God.

06:53.639 --> 06:55.340
- How do you get
a hold of wines like that?

06:55.341 --> 06:59.411
- Only bing
finds wine like that.

06:59.412 --> 07:01.012
This time he unearthed

07:01.013 --> 07:04.983
a sub-basement in
new Jersey, of all places.

07:04.984 --> 07:07.152
A stash of
George Washington's wine

07:07.153 --> 07:10.322
as he lead his army
against the redcoats.

07:10.323 --> 07:13.458
His initials are engraved
on each of the three bottles.

07:13.459 --> 07:16.661
- Three bottles?
We heard there were six.

07:16.662 --> 07:18.330
- Did loy tell you that?

07:18.331 --> 07:19.498
He's dim.

07:19.499 --> 07:23.668
He must've meant
that we tasted six wines.

07:23.669 --> 07:27.973
A '45, a '21.
An 1899.

07:27.974 --> 07:32.244
Bing wanted us to put
the chateau de tour in context.

07:32.245 --> 07:33.445
- Must've hardo
contextualize,

07:33.446 --> 07:35.747
after drinking
half a case of wine.

07:35.748 --> 07:36.948
- Not at this level.

07:36.949 --> 07:38.483
Our sommelier
gave it a perfect score.

07:38.484 --> 07:42.621
I bought the remaining pair
for 350,000 Euros.

07:42.622 --> 07:44.656
They'll fetch
half a million at auction.

07:44.657 --> 07:47.125
- What time did you leave?

07:47.126 --> 07:49.127
- Just after 11:00.

07:49.128 --> 07:50.562
Why would you-

07:50.563 --> 07:52.097
you said bing died of
a heart attack.

07:52.098 --> 07:53.999
- A millionaire's death
is never simple.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.701
We'll need the names
of your guests.

07:56.702 --> 07:59.237
- Ms. balon,
our sommelier, was there.

07:59.238 --> 08:02.007
But lang/malreaux can't
give out the name of a client.

08:02.008 --> 08:03.141
That's confidential.

08:03.142 --> 08:05.444
- This is
a police investigation.

08:05.445 --> 08:06.945
We'll just get a subpoena.

08:06.946 --> 08:09.147
- You make it
sound chilling, detective.

08:09.148 --> 08:11.649
Send the D.A. My best.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.719
- So how's
the investigation going

08:14.720 --> 08:17.889
into the heart attack
of the mayor's wine advisor?

08:17.890 --> 08:22.060
- Tox screen says he had
a blood alcohol level of 1.9.

08:22.061 --> 08:24.629
Blood pressure meds,
nitrates for angina.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.131
- None of those will
kill you.

08:26.132 --> 08:29.134
- Well,
those with Viagra can.

08:29.135 --> 08:30.268
- Viagra?
Whoa.

08:30.269 --> 08:33.138
Whoa, now is
this even a homicide?

08:33.139 --> 08:35.440
- Lab scanned a shard of
glass from the wine cellar.

08:35.441 --> 08:37.542
It tested
positive for Viagra.

08:37.543 --> 08:39.878
- Nitrates and Viagra
dissolved in wine,

08:39.879 --> 08:41.580
could've
triggered a heart attack.

08:41.581 --> 08:43.849
The killer locked bing
inside his walk-in,

08:43.850 --> 08:45.183
and left him to die.

08:45.184 --> 08:47.652
- The spouse would have
access to the medicine cabinet.

08:47.653 --> 08:48.854
What about Avery?

08:48.855 --> 08:50.188
- She's from Nebraska.

08:50.189 --> 08:53.124
No priors.
Tough childhood, though.

08:53.125 --> 08:55.427
Her mom had a sheet.
Drugs and prostitution.

08:55.428 --> 08:57.395
Avery came to new York
after college.

08:57.396 --> 09:00.298
She's a senior vp at
Wellman media.

09:00.299 --> 09:02.033
- She wasn't
the only one there, though.

09:02.034 --> 09:05.270
He had a wine tasting
at his place that night,

09:05.271 --> 09:06.571
with three other guests.

09:06.572 --> 09:08.573
And the t.O.D.
Was between 1:00 and 3:00 A.M.

09:08.574 --> 09:10.842
- He could've died anytime
between thirty minutes

09:10.843 --> 09:13.278
and three hours
after his wine was dosed.

09:13.279 --> 09:15.347
- So everyone
had means and opportunity.

09:15.348 --> 09:16.648
But who had motive?

09:16.649 --> 09:18.884
- Your wine expert's here.

09:18.885 --> 09:23.054
Hm, maybe she
can tell us who had one.

09:23.055 --> 09:24.356
- I'm sorry.

09:24.357 --> 09:27.526
I was told not to discuss
who was at the tasting.

09:27.527 --> 09:30.061
- By who?
- Mr. Dilahunt.

09:30.062 --> 09:32.297
He insists on
client confidentiality.

09:32.298 --> 09:35.266
- Well,
I can understand that.

09:37.636 --> 09:42.807
Lang/malreaux must
respect you enormously,

09:42.808 --> 09:45.877
to have brought you
to a bing tasting.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.145
- I was honored.

09:47.146 --> 09:50.046
It was my first time
at that level.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.602
- It's terrible that he...
- Your first time,

09:51.603 --> 09:53.503
how longe have
you been with him?

09:53.504 --> 09:56.404
Two and a half year in
ny office before that, London.

09:57.105 --> 10:02.505
And... your company
helped you with your e h-1b visa?

10:04.063 --> 10:06.932
- You have to
get that renewed, right?

10:06.933 --> 10:08.066
How often do you?

10:08.067 --> 10:09.401
- Every three years.

10:09.402 --> 10:12.070
You must be about
to apply for an extension.

10:12.071 --> 10:15.774
- Oh, geez.

10:15.775 --> 10:18.743
- So...Who was the client?

10:20.879 --> 10:23.181
- Bing's death,
eh, it's a tragedy.

10:23.182 --> 10:25.383
A terrible loss.

10:25.384 --> 10:27.252
- Were you close?

10:27.253 --> 10:29.654
- No.

10:29.655 --> 10:33.892
No, I found him
a bit, uh, pushy.

10:33.893 --> 10:36.595
That's 17th century
savoyard.

10:36.596 --> 10:40.131
Please don't touch it.

10:40.132 --> 10:42.901
- But, you know,
having the chance

10:42.902 --> 10:46.871
to taste
a 1775 chateau de tour.

10:46.872 --> 10:49.441
There's two bottles
like that left the world.

10:49.442 --> 10:51.977
I'm surprised that
you let Dilahunt take both.

10:51.978 --> 10:54.980
- Bing had an arrangement
with Dilahunt.

10:54.981 --> 10:56.381
Dilahunt showed up
with a briefcase

10:56.382 --> 10:58.416
full of Euros,
and left with the wine.

10:58.417 --> 11:01.219
- So you're going to bid
on the de tour at auction?

11:01.220 --> 11:04.789
- Well, the tasting was
ev's version of marketing.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.725
And it worked.

11:06.726 --> 11:08.860
So yeah,
I'll be bidding.

11:08.861 --> 11:11.796
And you buy
mostly from auction?

11:11.797 --> 11:15.567
- Yeah.
Bordeaux futures subscriptions.

11:15.568 --> 11:18.269
I've got 5,000 bottles here,
and 2,000 in palm beach.

11:18.270 --> 11:22.440
- Oh.
Could we see your cellar?

11:22.441 --> 11:24.709
- Sadly no.

11:24.710 --> 11:27.012
I need to limit the vibration
and movement down there,

11:27.013 --> 11:29.981
I'm sure you understand.
- Mm.

11:31.617 --> 11:36.721
- Carl will show you out.

11:36.722 --> 11:38.657
- A man with
something to hide?

11:38.658 --> 11:41.192
- I think
it's my size 13 vibe.

11:48.567 --> 11:49.801
- Thanks.

11:49.802 --> 11:52.370
My doctor told me
I should drink more water.

11:52.371 --> 11:55.339
And he wants me to
take better care of myself.

12:01.113 --> 12:04.115
Um, I thought a lot
about last week.

12:04.116 --> 12:06.217
- Oh, you did?

12:06.218 --> 12:11.189
- About what I said,
that everybody lies.

12:11.190 --> 12:13.591
It's childish.

12:13.592 --> 12:14.693
You're right.
The truth is

12:14.694 --> 12:15.994
is that there
are people that I trust.

12:15.995 --> 12:18.196
- Anyone in particular
come to mind?

12:18.197 --> 12:19.664
- Yeah, my partner.

12:19.665 --> 12:22.033
Yeah,
she always has my back.

12:22.034 --> 12:23.401
- Tell me
a little bit about her.

12:23.402 --> 12:26.538
- Well, she's a good cop.

12:26.539 --> 12:28.440
You know, she's
more practical than I am.

12:28.441 --> 12:33.545
She's smart...
You know, works hard,

12:33.546 --> 12:35.880
commands respect-
- okay, I know what she does.

12:35.881 --> 12:39.718
What's she like?

12:39.719 --> 12:43.021
- She grew up here.

12:43.022 --> 12:45.523
Her father was a cop,
her husband.

12:45.524 --> 12:47.492
- Oh, she's married?
- No.

12:47.493 --> 12:49.761
He died in the line of
duty before we met.

12:49.762 --> 12:51.229
- And she never remarried?

12:53.198 --> 12:54.933
How long have you
been together?

12:54.934 --> 12:58.036
- Um...

12:58.037 --> 13:00.739
You know, there have been...

13:00.740 --> 13:03.408
Breaks.

13:03.409 --> 13:06.611
Uh, I guess,
like, 11 or 12 years?

13:06.612 --> 13:09.180
- Hm.
How do you feel about her?

13:09.181 --> 13:12.350
- I told you,
I respect her, I admire her.

13:12.351 --> 13:16.054
She puts up with
my crap, you know?

13:16.055 --> 13:17.756
And as you're learning,
that's not easy.

13:17.757 --> 13:20.258
- Do you love her?

13:20.259 --> 13:21.726
- What?

13:21.727 --> 13:24.729
I- she's...My partner!

13:24.730 --> 13:26.531
A profess-I mean,
the last thing she would need

13:26.532 --> 13:28.700
is for me to hit on her-
- no, I didn't ask you

13:28.701 --> 13:31.302
what she needs.
- Yeah.

13:31.303 --> 13:34.272
- She's a major
relationship in your life.

13:35.641 --> 13:38.109
Do you have any
romantic feelings for her?

13:38.110 --> 13:40.078
- No.

13:40.079 --> 13:41.279
She's like a sister to me.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.749
- Do you have a sister?
- I have a brother.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.951
- That woman...

13:46.952 --> 13:48.887
Is that your wife?

13:48.888 --> 13:51.156
- That's...
That's my partner.

13:51.157 --> 13:53.307
- So what
are you waiting for?

13:53.308 --> 13:56.327
- It's not that kind of
partner, it's...

13:56.328 --> 13:58.663
Now he's gone too.

13:58.664 --> 14:00.532
- So she's like a sister?

14:00.533 --> 14:04.269
It's important to you

14:04.270 --> 14:07.539
that I know that there aren't
any romantic possibilities

14:07.540 --> 14:08.873
between the two of you,
isn't it?

14:08.874 --> 14:10.742
- You know, I don't get it.
I mean, what...?

14:10.743 --> 14:13.578
You know,
when a man can't have

14:13.579 --> 14:15.747
a working friendship
with his partner?

14:15.748 --> 14:17.015
I mean,
it has to be more than that?

14:17.016 --> 14:18.216
- This is not my point.

14:18.217 --> 14:21.152
I'm wondering if
you think romantic feelings

14:21.153 --> 14:24.489
for someone you admire
and respect are at odds.

14:26.959 --> 14:32.497
- Are there any women
in your life?

14:32.498 --> 14:35.066
- The last few years I've
been dealing with a lot of loss.

14:35.067 --> 14:38.536
- Mm-hmm, more than
your fair share.

14:38.537 --> 14:40.605
And before that?

14:40.606 --> 14:43.574
- I've had...Relationships.

14:46.111 --> 14:49.447
It's just that in
my work...

14:49.448 --> 14:51.416
You know, the hours
aren't conducive.

14:51.417 --> 14:57.288
You know,
a man of my age...

14:57.289 --> 15:01.392
Single
a long time, you know?

15:01.393 --> 15:03.628
All of my problems,
it's too late.

15:03.629 --> 15:04.929
I mean, that's
what you're thinking.

15:04.930 --> 15:07.365
- What else am I thinking?

15:10.202 --> 15:12.904
Look, between your work
and your affect,

15:12.905 --> 15:15.974
um...

15:15.975 --> 15:18.543
You've created
an emotional drawbridge

15:18.544 --> 15:21.379
that's protected you
in many ways.

15:23.515 --> 15:25.082
It's a good thing.

15:29.421 --> 15:32.356
Do you ever feel lonely?

15:40.265 --> 15:41.766
- Ev Dilahunt told us

15:41.767 --> 15:44.936
he gave your husband
350,000 dollars in Euros.

15:44.937 --> 15:46.671
But the safe was empty.

15:46.672 --> 15:48.373
- There's
a safe down there?

15:48.374 --> 15:51.943
The only one that he
let in the cellar was loy.

15:51.944 --> 15:54.312
- We need to talk to loy.

15:54.313 --> 15:55.713
- Loy's home.

15:55.714 --> 15:58.082
He asked
to take a few days off.

16:25.469 --> 16:27.869
I told you,
I took care of Mr. bing.

16:27.870 --> 16:30.639
I cook for him.
I gave him his pills.

16:30.640 --> 16:33.475
When I saw him that morning,
on the floor, I cried.

16:33.476 --> 16:35.544
- Before or after
you took his money?

16:35.545 --> 16:38.280
- My sister
called me on Friday.

16:38.281 --> 16:40.182
She said our mother
needs dialysis.

16:40.183 --> 16:41.616
I prayed to God all night

16:41.617 --> 16:43.919
for the money
to take care of her.

16:43.920 --> 16:48.357
Then, I came in and saw
Mr. bing on the floor,

16:48.358 --> 16:49.925
and the money in the safe.

16:49.926 --> 16:52.661
- God's will?

16:52.662 --> 16:54.329
Or yours?

16:54.330 --> 16:56.131
- Mine?

16:56.132 --> 16:57.799
Of course not.
He had a heart attack.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.134
- No.
See, he didn't.

16:59.135 --> 17:02.137
So someone gave him a glass of we
laced with Viagra.

17:02.138 --> 17:04.271
- Oh my God.

17:04.272 --> 17:07.142
- Then from the cooler
was locked from outside.

17:07.143 --> 17:09.444
- It was unlocked
when I saw him.

17:09.444 --> 17:12.446
I swear.

17:14.250 --> 17:18.920
He was fine when I left.

17:18.921 --> 17:20.689
Ask Mr. ev.

17:20.690 --> 17:23.759
- Mr. Dilahunt was
still there when you left?

17:23.760 --> 17:28.163
- Mr. bing was very angry
that the nose wasn't there.

17:28.164 --> 17:29.531
He said that
if he was going down,

17:29.532 --> 17:30.665
they were all going down.

17:30.666 --> 17:33.368
- The nose?

17:33.369 --> 17:36.204
- Hutton mays?

17:36.205 --> 17:38.673
He's one of the world's
foremost wine critics.

17:38.674 --> 17:40.041
He writes descriptions
of the wine

17:40.042 --> 17:41.309
for the auction house
catalog.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.711
And if he gives it
a perfect score,

17:42.712 --> 17:44.880
well, then the price of it
could skyrocket.

17:44.881 --> 17:47.082
- He comes to
all the tastings.

17:47.083 --> 17:48.883
Except this last one.

17:51.020 --> 17:54.122
- My nose was congested.
Couldn't smell.

17:54.123 --> 17:55.690
- But here you are!

17:55.691 --> 17:57.092
Antibiotics?

17:57.093 --> 18:00.295
- Zinc.

18:00.296 --> 18:03.264
- You must've been upset.

18:05.134 --> 18:07.602
Missing an opportunity
of a lifetime like that one.

18:07.603 --> 18:10.338
- Bing held opportunity
of a lifetime tastings

18:10.339 --> 18:12.174
every six months.

18:12.175 --> 18:15.143
- May I?
- Oh.

18:22.551 --> 18:23.852
- A brunello.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.188
Di montalcino?

18:26.189 --> 18:27.556
- And?

18:27.557 --> 18:28.757
- It's nice.

18:28.758 --> 18:31.526
It's a bit thin
for my taste.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.961
I'm more like a barbaresco
kind of guy.

18:32.962 --> 18:34.529
You know,
a little more umph.

18:34.530 --> 18:38.533
- Well, let's just say
you don't have a cop's palate.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.001
- Well,
it's nothing like yours.

18:40.002 --> 18:45.307
Did you know his nose was
insured for $5 million?

18:45.308 --> 18:48.910
I mean, someone of
your talent, and ego...

18:52.114 --> 18:55.517
Why would you let
a novice rate that wine?

18:55.518 --> 18:58.487
- I told you,
I was stopped up.

18:58.488 --> 19:00.355
- When you didn't show,

19:00.356 --> 19:04.159
bing told ev Dilahunt he would
take you all down with him.

19:04.160 --> 19:08.964
Any idea what he meant?

19:08.965 --> 19:11.199
- Bing had
this uncanny knack

19:11.200 --> 19:14.002
for unearthing
lost collections of the czars,

19:14.003 --> 19:17.205
wines hidden in monasteries
from the Nazis...

19:17.206 --> 19:20.408
- So you thought
the wines were fake.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.277
- Not by taste.

19:22.278 --> 19:23.645
He may have given me
the real ones,

19:23.646 --> 19:25.247
then passed
the fake ones off.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.548
But I felt
that he and Dilahunt

19:26.549 --> 19:28.616
may have been using
my name to promote fraud.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.954
- Carbon-dating measures

19:32.955 --> 19:36.191
the radioactive isotopes
in the grapes.

19:36.192 --> 19:39.294
Now radiation levels
changed in the '50s.

19:39.295 --> 19:40.929
- After the bomb.
- Yes.

19:40.930 --> 19:44.533
Now, judging from the sediment,
is this wine pre-Hiroshima?

19:44.534 --> 19:45.934
It's no question.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.703
Was it produced before
the declaration of independence?

19:48.704 --> 19:50.939
You'd have to
ask George Washington.

19:50.940 --> 19:54.142
Now that said...

19:54.143 --> 19:57.712
This wine is counterfeit.

19:57.713 --> 20:00.315
See?
Washington's initials?

20:00.316 --> 20:03.885
There, see?
Machine-tooled.

20:03.886 --> 20:07.589
A bottle from 1775
would've been hand-engraved.

20:07.590 --> 20:10.158
- If it's that obvious,

20:10.159 --> 20:11.693
how come no one else
caught it?

20:11.694 --> 20:13.094
- Obvious?

20:13.095 --> 20:15.063
It's an impeccable forgery.

20:15.064 --> 20:17.432
- The nose knew.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.501
- Why do you
think I caught a cold?

20:19.502 --> 20:22.003
- You ungrateful
little prick!

20:22.004 --> 20:24.139
- Oh, you mean nose.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.974
- I'll pull them from
the auction.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.976
- How about the rest
of the sale?

20:27.977 --> 20:29.778
You're selling
hundreds of lots

20:29.779 --> 20:31.246
imported
by Arnold binder.

20:31.247 --> 20:32.681
- Who?

20:32.682 --> 20:37.586
Bing Cullman's prints
belong to one Arnold binder

20:37.587 --> 20:40.188
who was
dishonorably discharged

20:40.189 --> 20:44.292
from the British army in
1975 at age 20.

20:44.293 --> 20:46.361
- A 30-year-old rap sheet
in england, isn't he?

20:46.362 --> 20:50.065
- We had no clue-
- come on, ev.

20:50.066 --> 20:52.801
Come on.
I have a question.

20:52.802 --> 20:54.936
How do you
know that all the wines

20:54.937 --> 20:56.338
he sold you weren't fake?

20:56.339 --> 20:58.173
Like the '47 la tonne?

20:58.174 --> 21:00.642
- The proof is in
the tasting.

21:00.643 --> 21:02.577
Hutton gave it a 3.95.

21:02.578 --> 21:04.212
- The wine
I tasted was genuine.

21:04.213 --> 21:05.480
- You told us you thought

21:05.481 --> 21:07.649
some of bing's wines
might be counterfeit.

21:07.650 --> 21:10.885
- Hutton's an artist,
but he's also a drama queen.

21:10.886 --> 21:14.022
- And you, ev, are a poseur.
You can't tell the difference

21:14.023 --> 21:15.523
between
a burgundy and a Bordeaux.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.559
- Easy, boys.
- No, no, let them go.

21:17.560 --> 21:22.330
Let them go, look what
they've told us already.

21:22.331 --> 21:23.331
So we have fraud...

21:23.332 --> 21:28.303
Grand theft,
counterfeiting,

21:28.304 --> 21:29.838
criminal conspiracy...

21:29.839 --> 21:31.072
- We got into it.

21:31.073 --> 21:33.375
Bing said
he'd bring everybody down.

21:33.376 --> 21:37.846
- Now, you made
that lying drunk millions,

21:37.847 --> 21:39.781
and he threatened to ruin

21:39.782 --> 21:41.850
the reputation
of your auction house.

21:41.851 --> 21:43.551
So what'd you do?

21:43.552 --> 21:45.987
Did you drop a little blue pill
in his glass?

21:45.988 --> 21:48.356
- Absolutely not!

21:48.357 --> 21:49.924
Bing was alive
when I left.

21:49.925 --> 21:52.394
He was plastered.
But he was upright.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.729
Ask his wife.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.631
Avery and
a very handsome young man

21:56.632 --> 21:59.600
had just come home
as I was leaving.

22:05.741 --> 22:09.077
Mrs. Cullman, we were
just coming up to talk to you.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.912
You didn't tell us you
brought a man home with you.

22:10.913 --> 22:14.115
- Oh, Shane Berlin.
He's one of our models.

22:14.116 --> 22:16.351
I got a little tipsy,
and he gave me a lift home.

22:16.352 --> 22:17.886
- He came inside
with you?

22:17.887 --> 22:20.055
- Yeah.
Yeah, for a couple minutes.

22:20.056 --> 22:22.557
- Do you usually
bring models home with you?

22:24.126 --> 22:26.428
- I don't sleep around,
if that's what you're saying.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.196
We had a glass of wine.

22:28.197 --> 22:29.497
- George Washington's?

22:29.498 --> 22:31.933
- No, bing was drinking
a bottle with his friends,

22:31.934 --> 22:33.201
and selling
the other five.

22:33.202 --> 22:36.671
- Six bottles.
We thought three.

22:36.672 --> 22:38.940
- No, I saw the receipt
for the armored car delivery.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.408
It was six.

22:40.409 --> 22:43.377
Okay, now if you'll excuse me,
I have to meet a client.

22:46.648 --> 22:50.919
- Drank one,
two sold for auction...

22:50.920 --> 22:52.287
Someone
has the other three.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.322
- Could be the dilettante,
the drama queen,

22:54.323 --> 22:57.291
or some
other alcoholic snob.

23:10.773 --> 23:14.442
- Coming.

23:14.443 --> 23:16.778
Wow.

23:16.779 --> 23:18.446
Uh, you're here.

23:18.447 --> 23:21.415
Bing's dead.
It's time.

23:32.409 --> 23:34.509
Well,
isn't the new York finest.

23:34.510 --> 23:37.478
- We just had
to see the cellar.

23:38.947 --> 23:42.350
- Come on in.

23:42.351 --> 23:45.653
- Guess what we found.

23:45.654 --> 23:47.522
- Will you look at that?

23:47.523 --> 23:50.558
George Washington's initials
right on the bottle.

23:53.261 --> 23:55.997
- Bing Cullman was
a greedy son of a bitch.

23:55.998 --> 23:57.298
He knew enough about me
to know

23:57.299 --> 24:00.067
I'd want
George Washington's wine.

24:00.068 --> 24:02.770
Well, he rang me
a few hours before the tasting.

24:02.771 --> 24:04.472
Said if I got there
early enough,

24:04.473 --> 24:07.241
he'd put
three bottles aside.

24:07.242 --> 24:10.211
He'd give them to me
and cut out the middleman.

24:10.212 --> 24:12.747
- Ev Dilahunt.
- Mm-hmm.

24:12.748 --> 24:14.148
So I got there early,

24:14.149 --> 24:16.317
and I bought
the chateau de tour.

24:16.318 --> 24:18.186
- And?

24:18.187 --> 24:20.354
- I didn't want him dead.

24:20.355 --> 24:22.190
I wanted him in jail.

24:22.191 --> 24:24.091
I taped the whole meeting.

24:24.092 --> 24:26.460
It's all there, detective.

24:26.461 --> 24:28.763
Wine investigators,
chemists, lawyers...

24:28.764 --> 24:31.933
I had detectives
tracking him

24:31.934 --> 24:34.902
when he unearthed
kaiser's lost cellars.

24:36.905 --> 24:39.040
Bing Cullman was

24:39.041 --> 24:42.510
the Bernie madoff
of the wine world.

24:42.511 --> 24:45.913
- You had him under
surveillance in new York?

24:45.914 --> 24:47.548
- Oh, yeah.

24:47.549 --> 24:49.850
For months at a time,
he was careless.

24:49.851 --> 24:51.118
- What's this?

24:51.119 --> 24:52.920
- That turned out to
be a dead end.

24:52.921 --> 24:56.757
I thought I'd finally discovered
his counterfeit wine lab.

24:56.758 --> 25:00.094
Turns out to be his...

25:00.095 --> 25:01.395
...His f-pad.

25:01.396 --> 25:04.331
He sublet it from
a fella named Arnold binder.

25:10.839 --> 25:14.075
- Good to see
bing's the sentimental type.

25:14.076 --> 25:17.044
- I know.

25:28.957 --> 25:31.626
Condoms, lubes...

25:31.627 --> 25:34.095
No Viagra.

25:34.096 --> 25:36.998
- Oh... when it
comes to escorts,

25:36.999 --> 25:38.733
he knows what he likes.

25:38.734 --> 25:41.702
- Farmer's daughter
escort service.

25:45.540 --> 25:46.641
- Last e-mail...

25:46.642 --> 25:49.644
"Send Emily."

25:49.645 --> 25:52.213
- It is nor hand,
nor foot, nor arm,

25:52.214 --> 25:54.582
nor any other
part belonging to man...

25:54.583 --> 25:57.018
Oh, be some other name!

25:57.019 --> 25:58.686
What's in a name?

25:58.687 --> 26:00.955
That which we call a rose
by any other name

26:00.956 --> 26:02.523
would smell as sweet...

26:02.524 --> 26:05.293
Very, very nice.

26:05.294 --> 26:09.964
- Are you here
for the showcase?

26:09.965 --> 26:11.499
- When did you last see bing?

26:11.500 --> 26:14.769
- Um...

26:14.770 --> 26:19.674
Thursday.
Late dinner.

26:19.675 --> 26:21.175
He was like
an uncle.

26:21.176 --> 26:24.245
- An uncle?
Really?

26:24.246 --> 26:26.314
What did you two do
at his loft?

26:26.315 --> 26:28.349
- It's not-

26:28.350 --> 26:32.320
we were friends, really.

26:32.321 --> 26:35.756
- You mean...What?

26:35.757 --> 26:41.595
You provided a...
A girlfriend experience.

26:41.596 --> 26:46.200
That's what your agency
calls it, right?

26:47.302 --> 26:50.004
He was super supportive.

26:50.005 --> 26:52.940
Taught me about wines.

26:52.941 --> 26:55.910
- Do you know if he took Viagra
Thursday or Friday night?

26:55.911 --> 26:57.712
- Not with me.
He couldn't.

26:57.713 --> 26:59.347
He already
had his Nitroglycerin.

26:59.348 --> 27:00.948
- And he was careful
about that?

27:00.949 --> 27:04.285
- Oh, God, so was I.

27:04.286 --> 27:08.189
I don't feel guilty.

27:08.190 --> 27:12.560
He had an open marriage.

27:12.561 --> 27:14.662
- An open marriage?

27:14.663 --> 27:16.864
Hardly.

27:16.865 --> 27:19.066
- He had a playpen for
his call girls.

27:19.067 --> 27:23.838
- What are you guys,
the sex police?

27:23.839 --> 27:27.108
We had been married
for a long time.

27:27.109 --> 27:28.509
- Understood.

27:28.510 --> 27:31.479
And you were still married
with the stresses.

27:31.480 --> 27:34.849
- Yes.
We fixed things.

27:34.850 --> 27:36.951
- You fixed things.

27:36.952 --> 27:40.521
This was the picture we
found on the wall

27:40.522 --> 27:43.490
of an apartment
where he met prostitutes.

27:50.198 --> 27:52.767
- Not so fixed...

27:52.768 --> 27:55.469
I saw this photo
in your house.

27:55.470 --> 27:59.206
Your husband had it
blown up to poster size

27:59.207 --> 28:02.176
and then desecrated it.

28:04.646 --> 28:06.380
He had it
hung in the same room

28:06.381 --> 28:08.916
where he had
sex with call girls.

28:16.090 --> 28:18.392
When I came home
with Shane...

28:18.393 --> 28:21.228
I heard noises from
the cellar.

28:21.229 --> 28:23.097
He had a girl down there.

28:23.098 --> 28:24.398
One of his whores.
- Avery-

28:24.399 --> 28:28.335
- no. No.
- Please.

28:28.336 --> 28:30.905
I waited for her to leave.

28:30.906 --> 28:32.606
I knew that if he'd
been with a girl,

28:32.607 --> 28:36.811
he would've taken Viagra.

28:36.812 --> 28:40.414
I poured a glass,
I put in the nitrates,

28:40.415 --> 28:45.786
and I locked
the cellar door.

28:45.787 --> 28:48.755
I am glad he's dead.

28:52.794 --> 28:58.365
I am really, really
happy about that.

28:58.366 --> 28:59.733
- You know, Avery,

28:59.734 --> 29:02.703
we have
to take you into custody.

29:05.748 --> 29:06.748
In holding.

29:06.749 --> 29:07.816
Nice job.
You got your confession.

29:07.817 --> 29:09.150
She drugged
her husband's wine,

29:09.151 --> 29:11.219
and then locked him
in the cellar.

29:11.220 --> 29:13.421
- But she's lying.

29:13.422 --> 29:14.923
- Excuse me?

29:14.924 --> 29:17.192
- She told us that
she put his heart medicine

29:17.193 --> 29:18.693
in his wine glass.

29:18.694 --> 29:20.662
But we tested
the glass shard,

29:20.663 --> 29:22.597
it had Viagra,
no nitrates.

29:22.598 --> 29:23.698
- Why would she lie?

29:23.699 --> 29:24.966
- She's covering for someone.

29:24.967 --> 29:27.402
- Thanks.
Might know who.

29:27.403 --> 29:28.803
Turns out Avery's
been paying rent

29:28.804 --> 29:30.338
on a Murray hill
one bedroom.

29:30.339 --> 29:31.873
Started two months ago.

29:31.874 --> 29:35.043
- His and her love nests.

29:35.044 --> 29:37.579
- I brought you
something to drink.

29:37.580 --> 29:38.880
- Thanks.

29:43.986 --> 29:47.522
- You have
your own apartment.

29:47.523 --> 29:50.058
Who do you bring there?
Just Shane, or...?

29:50.059 --> 29:53.395
- No, we work together,
that's all.

29:53.396 --> 29:56.431
- We'll put the two of you
together, you know that.

29:59.435 --> 30:03.338
You really want to
carry his water?

30:03.339 --> 30:06.307
- I did it.

30:11.047 --> 30:12.480
So with bing
out of the way,

30:12.481 --> 30:17.385
he would have you and
all bing's money to himself.

30:17.386 --> 30:21.056
What happened
that Friday night?

30:21.057 --> 30:23.391
- I came home with Shane,

30:23.392 --> 30:26.461
we heard bing in
the basement with his girl,

30:26.462 --> 30:29.430
and I sent Shane home.

30:34.870 --> 30:38.473
- You overheard your husband
with a hooker,

30:38.474 --> 30:41.409
you then you
waited for her to leave.

30:47.249 --> 30:49.818
You poisoned him.

30:49.819 --> 30:52.554
And that's your story?

30:52.555 --> 30:55.523
- Yes.

30:59.629 --> 31:00.929
- Shane Berlin?

31:00.930 --> 31:02.430
- Yeah?

31:02.431 --> 31:04.399
- Do you mind if we
come in?

31:04.400 --> 31:08.370
Thank you.

31:08.371 --> 31:10.071
You live here alone?

31:10.072 --> 31:11.706
- No,
with my girlfriend.

31:11.707 --> 31:13.408
- Your girlfriend
Avery Cullman?

31:13.409 --> 31:18.580
- What?
- Avery Cullman.

31:18.581 --> 31:22.817
- Juliet...
And her Romeo.

31:22.818 --> 31:24.719
- What are you doing here?

31:24.720 --> 31:27.822
- We were just
talking about Avery.

31:27.823 --> 31:29.424
- You mind
if I take a look around?

31:29.425 --> 31:32.393
- No, go ahead.

31:35.631 --> 31:38.566
- So...You two
meet in acting class?

31:51.246 --> 31:53.181
- Emily, listen,

31:53.182 --> 31:56.885
this is not
off-Broadway theatre.

31:56.886 --> 31:58.987
Okay?

31:58.988 --> 32:00.622
You're looking
at felony murder.

32:00.623 --> 32:02.757
- That's crazy.
We didn't do anything.

32:02.758 --> 32:03.892
- Maybe you didn't,

32:03.893 --> 32:05.460
but we're thinking
that Shane did.

32:05.461 --> 32:08.363
That he poisoned bing,
and he left him to die.

32:08.364 --> 32:10.799
- You think
Shane was jealous?

32:10.800 --> 32:12.534
'Cause he wasn't.

32:12.535 --> 32:13.802
He knew all about
me and bing,

32:13.803 --> 32:15.170
he was cool with it.

32:15.171 --> 32:18.139
- Of course he was.

32:38.160 --> 32:41.996
- So how did it play out?

32:41.997 --> 32:46.901
You help Shane get
bing out of the picture,

32:46.902 --> 32:51.005
so that Shane
could hook up with Avery...

32:51.006 --> 32:53.475
And the two of you
could bleed her dry?

32:53.476 --> 32:56.511
- I didn't want bing
out of the way.

32:56.512 --> 32:58.346
I told you, I liked him.

32:58.347 --> 33:00.582
- Like an uncle.

33:00.583 --> 33:04.319
- And bing
really, really liked me.

33:04.320 --> 33:08.823
He said I gave him
his smile back.

33:08.824 --> 33:11.793
- Really, really?

33:13.595 --> 33:16.698
- He was leaving his wife,
you know.

33:16.699 --> 33:18.166
- He told you that?

33:18.167 --> 33:21.636
- I heard him talking
to his lawyer about it.

33:21.637 --> 33:23.905
He said it was days away.

33:26.508 --> 33:28.476
- Okay.
The wife, I get.

33:28.477 --> 33:31.279
She confesses to keep her
lover out of jail.

33:31.280 --> 33:34.215
Then she'll hire the best
defense attorney money can buy.

33:34.216 --> 33:37.085
And the D.A. Won't file
charges based on her confession.

33:37.086 --> 33:38.920
Shane gives her
reasonable doubt.

33:38.921 --> 33:42.423
We've got nothing.

33:42.424 --> 33:46.361
- You know, when Avery
saw the wedding photo,

33:46.362 --> 33:49.197
I mean, she looked hurt,
but she didn't look surprised.

33:54.503 --> 33:57.505
I'm gonna get a hold
of her personal belongings.

33:57.506 --> 34:00.474
We need a search warrant.

34:07.549 --> 34:11.853
Here's the man
you confessed for.

34:11.853 --> 34:14.022
He played you.

34:14.023 --> 34:16.056
- No.
Why would I kill him?

34:16.058 --> 34:17.958
- Avery says you
were in love with her.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.893
You can't be serious.

34:19.895 --> 34:23.864
Look at me.

34:23.866 --> 34:26.868
- So maybe you were
in love with her townhouse.

34:26.869 --> 34:30.170
You were there the night
bing was killed.

34:30.172 --> 34:31.438
- She left for awhile,

34:31.440 --> 34:34.641
then came back
and asked me for a lift home.

34:34.643 --> 34:37.411
- She left the shoot?
Where'd she go?

34:37.413 --> 34:39.112
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

34:39.114 --> 34:43.251
Really?
You two were close, right?

34:43.252 --> 34:45.954
She gave you modeling jobs,
an apartment...

34:45.955 --> 34:48.889
You've got it all wrong.

34:48.891 --> 34:53.261
I was working for him.

34:53.262 --> 34:55.929
- Bing was paying you?
Can you prove it?

34:55.931 --> 34:57.232
- He paid in cash.

34:57.233 --> 34:59.567
Bing told Emily
he needed a dude

34:59.568 --> 35:01.069
to hook up
with some cougar.

35:01.070 --> 35:03.571
- He hired you
to service his wife?

35:03.572 --> 35:04.839
- Yep.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.341
But she had
no interest in hooking up.

35:06.342 --> 35:08.409
- We spoke
to bing's lawyer,

35:08.410 --> 35:12.180
and his filing says
you planned on testifying

35:12.181 --> 35:15.016
that you and Avery
were having an affair.

35:15.017 --> 35:17.385
- I told bing
I did her anyway.

35:17.386 --> 35:19.187
I wanted the bonus
that he promised me

35:19.188 --> 35:20.855
if I scored
before the end of the week.

35:20.856 --> 35:23.491
- So you never had sex
with Avery Cullman?

35:23.492 --> 35:25.126
- Ew. No.

35:25.127 --> 35:27.562
Too old and too weird
for me.

35:27.563 --> 35:29.364
Then a couple days
after bing died,

35:29.365 --> 35:32.467
she came by my place
and came on to me.

35:32.468 --> 35:33.935
Hard.

35:33.936 --> 35:35.503
Then she went into the bedroom
and must have freaked out,

35:35.504 --> 35:39.674
'cause she left
before anything could happen.

35:39.675 --> 35:41.609
- Shane says
that bing offered him

35:41.610 --> 35:43.878
a big bonus
at end of the week.

35:43.879 --> 35:46.847
Just before
your tenth anniversary.

35:50.185 --> 35:53.788
Ten years of that
that lying, cheating...

35:53.789 --> 35:55.323
It was a fraud.

35:55.324 --> 35:56.858
I mean, he didn't even
tell you his real name!

35:56.859 --> 36:00.295
I don't know how you stuck
with him for all those years.

36:00.296 --> 36:03.798
- I took a vow.
And I loved him.

36:03.799 --> 36:06.567
- You must have
to sign this prenup.

36:06.568 --> 36:09.037
Did you even have a lawyer?

36:09.038 --> 36:14.442
- I wasn't marrying him
for his money.

36:14.443 --> 36:17.645
- According to this...

36:17.646 --> 36:21.382
The prenup disappears
after ten years.

36:21.383 --> 36:25.520
You become equal partners.

36:25.521 --> 36:28.656
- That's irrelevant.

36:28.657 --> 36:31.025
- D you know...

36:31.026 --> 36:34.195
That you have
a fidelity clause,

36:34.196 --> 36:37.298
but he didn't?

36:40.268 --> 36:44.339
Did you just
find that out last Friday?

36:44.340 --> 36:47.308
The day of your
photo shoot?

36:50.979 --> 36:56.617
He was serve you
the divorce papers.

37:01.957 --> 37:04.725
Pardon me for going
through your bag here.

37:15.537 --> 37:17.238
This key...

37:17.239 --> 37:19.741
This is to bing's love nest,
right?

37:19.742 --> 37:22.710
Apartment six,
Arnold binder.

37:24.813 --> 37:28.483
See, Shane...

37:28.484 --> 37:32.020
He said that
you left the photo shoot.

37:32.021 --> 37:34.389
Now I'm thinking
you went to apartment six.

37:34.390 --> 37:38.292
And you saw
the wedding photo

37:38.293 --> 37:40.862
and what he had done to it.

37:40.863 --> 37:43.097
Did he leave
the divorce papers there?

37:43.098 --> 37:46.467
Were they on
the bed?

37:46.468 --> 37:51.672
Because we had
to subpoena bing's lawyer

37:51.673 --> 37:53.708
to get a hold of this.

37:53.709 --> 37:56.711
"The claimant files on
the grounds of infidelity.

37:56.712 --> 37:59.313
"Included is a deposition
from Shane Berlin,

37:59.314 --> 38:02.583
"who testifies to
a two month sexual relationship

38:02.584 --> 38:05.386
with Mrs. Avery Cullman."

38:05.387 --> 38:09.157
- Yes!

38:09.158 --> 38:11.359
- No.

38:11.360 --> 38:14.529
See, bing...
He thought he had you

38:14.530 --> 38:17.965
because Shane lied to him
about you being unfaithful.

38:17.966 --> 38:21.302
And he was going to serve you
the divorce papers

38:21.303 --> 38:24.172
three days before
your tenth anniversary.

38:24.173 --> 38:26.474
- Shane is lying.

38:26.475 --> 38:28.609
We loved each other.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.445
And I confessed to
protect him.

38:30.446 --> 38:31.946
- You confessed
to make it look like

38:31.947 --> 38:34.082
you were protecting him.

38:34.083 --> 38:37.285
You deliberately gave us
a flawed confession,

38:37.286 --> 38:40.421
knowing that we would
catch you in a lie.

38:40.422 --> 38:43.191
- So confess to something
that I actually did?

38:43.192 --> 38:44.592
Okay, I would have
to be crazy.

38:44.593 --> 38:46.427
- Yeah, crazy like a fox.

38:46.428 --> 38:48.129
You knew that eventually
we would stumble

38:48.130 --> 38:50.298
onto the divorce papers
and Shane.

38:50.299 --> 38:53.801
You needed to
create reasonable doubt

38:53.802 --> 38:55.736
in case
we ever charged you.

38:55.737 --> 38:58.239
So what did you do?

38:58.240 --> 39:00.541
You took Shane to
the townhouse

39:00.542 --> 39:03.744
and placed him at the scene.

39:03.745 --> 39:06.080
You took bing's Viagra

39:06.081 --> 39:09.016
and planted it when you
went to Shane's apartment.

39:09.017 --> 39:10.751
- I didn't
want bing's money.

39:10.752 --> 39:13.187
I have no reason
to kill him.

39:13.188 --> 39:16.924
- No, it's not
about the money. Right.

39:16.925 --> 39:19.894
Not at all.

39:22.130 --> 39:25.065
Nebraska?

39:30.705 --> 39:33.641
Your mother?

39:37.078 --> 39:41.916
She had a hard life.
Drugs. Prostitution.

39:41.917 --> 39:46.320
- I am not my mother.
- No.

39:46.321 --> 39:49.090
No, you got out of
Nebraska.

39:49.091 --> 39:52.092
You moved to the big city,
you married a millionaire.

39:56.231 --> 39:58.599
He tried to make you cheat,
and you didn't.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.903
- I told you...

40:01.904 --> 40:04.939
- I know,
you're not your mother.

40:07.209 --> 40:10.778
But you told bing
all about her.

40:10.779 --> 40:13.981
And he used that
to hurt you.

40:13.982 --> 40:16.751
To make you feel
like you were her.

40:16.752 --> 40:20.454
He's a monster.
A psychopath.

40:20.455 --> 40:22.790
He was-
he was sadistic!

40:34.336 --> 40:40.107
- My prenup was $1 million
over ten years.

40:40.108 --> 40:44.378
That comes out to
$300 a night.

40:44.379 --> 40:47.348
"Just enough for
a whore like you," he said.

40:51.820 --> 40:54.255
- But you're not a whore.

40:54.256 --> 40:58.392
He did all that to ruin
the last ten years of your life.

40:58.393 --> 41:01.128
To erase it.

41:01.129 --> 41:03.164
To make
your life irrelevant.

41:03.165 --> 41:06.968
- So, I said
"let's have a toast...

41:06.969 --> 41:10.571
To the good years."

41:10.572 --> 41:13.074
He went to the John,

41:13.075 --> 41:14.842
and I put Viagra
in his wine.

41:14.843 --> 41:16.877
- And you heard him
go into the walk-in.

41:16.878 --> 41:18.779
- I knew
that he'd go there.

41:18.780 --> 41:22.883
He couldn't resist
one more bottle.

41:22.884 --> 41:25.920
So I went downstairs...

41:25.921 --> 41:28.089
I slammed the door...

41:28.090 --> 41:30.491
Locked it...

41:30.492 --> 41:34.962
And went to bed.

41:34.963 --> 41:39.500
- The irony is,
is that he died before

41:39.501 --> 41:41.836
the divorce papers
could be officially filed.

41:41.837 --> 41:46.240
You would have
inherited everything.

41:46.241 --> 41:50.544
- It was
never about the money.

41:50.545 --> 41:54.015
I am not a whore.

41:54.016 --> 41:57.018
- No.

41:57.019 --> 41:59.987
No, you're not.

42:04.025 --> 42:06.661
You're a murderer.
