WEBVTT

00:10.043 --> 00:10.811
‐ That's not the sheriff,
where's Nicole?

00:11.945 --> 00:12.679
‐ She was alone.
‐ You alone kept
the homestead safe.

00:13.780 --> 00:14.181
‐ Please don't shoot.
‐ Casey, don't be a weenie!

00:15.182 --> 00:16.817
I don't even
have my gun anymore.

00:17.684 --> 00:18.418
‐ How could we have been
in that garden

00:18.986 --> 00:19.653
for a year and a half?

00:20.654 --> 00:21.154
‐ Apparently, I haven't pooped
in 18 months.

00:22.389 --> 00:23.757
‐ John Henry Holliday.

00:23.857 --> 00:24.791
Amon.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.493
‐ I love you, Nicole Haught.

00:26.593 --> 00:28.996
‐ I'm sorry,
I'm just so distracted.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.497
(screaming)

00:30.597 --> 00:31.565
‐ They're back.

00:34.868 --> 00:35.702
‐ So good to be home.

00:35.802 --> 00:36.937
(moaning)

00:38.505 --> 00:40.173
(Wynonna): Is this
an intervention or something?

00:40.274 --> 00:42.109
Because honestly,
fair enough, you know?

00:42.209 --> 00:45.712
I just, I would've
appreciated a wardrobe change,

00:46.413 --> 00:48.448
maybe a heeled boot situation.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.183
Maybe no hood.

00:51.184 --> 00:52.953
Seriously, when's this thing
coming off?

00:53.887 --> 00:54.688
Ugh!

00:54.788 --> 00:56.189
‐ That is bright.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.659
Can you dim
those lights, please?

00:58.759 --> 01:00.460
I mean, where we,
at the dentist?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.963
(chuckling)
‐ I don't know. Are we?

01:04.598 --> 01:07.568
‐ I'm Deputy Assistant Director
Naomi Hycha.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.971
Oh! I also love me
a "py‐jam‐jam".

01:12.272 --> 01:13.006
‐ Black Badge?

01:13.774 --> 01:15.142
Does that mean Black Badge is‐‐

01:15.242 --> 01:16.510
‐ No longer defunct.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.446
‐ Well, you brought the noise,

01:19.546 --> 01:22.149
I guess it makes sense
you're bringing in defunct.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.350
‐ Oh, right...

01:23.850 --> 01:26.553
Sorry about the whole

01:26.653 --> 01:28.622
extraordinary rendition jam.

01:29.356 --> 01:31.291
Here let me, uh, is that...
‐ It's on the other...

01:31.391 --> 01:33.393
Just give me it.
‐ Okay.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.062
Well, we are psyched
to have you back.

01:35.162 --> 01:37.664
‐ I am not back!
I am in my jam‐jams!

01:37.764 --> 01:38.365
‐ Okay.

01:38.465 --> 01:40.968
Babe, dial it back a notch.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.370
We're on the same team, here.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.872
You're just...
You're just late to the party.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.408
But we need every employee,

01:48.508 --> 01:50.711
no matter how minor, Agent...

01:50.811 --> 01:52.346
Agent Arp.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.415
‐ Jeremy?

01:55.515 --> 01:57.184
Oh, my God!

01:57.284 --> 01:58.952
‐ Hey...
‐ Ay‐ay‐ay‐ay!

02:00.654 --> 02:02.823
What happened to your gorgeous
little chicken limbs?

02:02.923 --> 02:06.426
‐ And a fond hi,
former colleague.

02:06.526 --> 02:08.929
Naomi, so sorry, I know her.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.231
This is the Wynonna Arp.

02:11.331 --> 02:13.266
‐ Uh... Why does everybody
keep saying it like that?

02:13.367 --> 02:15.369
‐ Employee of the Month,
June 2016.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.607
‐ Uh... It was February,
actually.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.876
‐ Oh, so the shortest month?
Mm‐hmm.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.212
‐ Don't worry.
Wynonna hates demons.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.446
Like we all do.

02:26.546 --> 02:29.116
‐ Hell yeah, brother. Pfft...

02:29.216 --> 02:30.617
Despise them deems.

02:30.717 --> 02:34.087
‐ But she's never killed one,
of course.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.357
‐ Nope. No.

02:37.457 --> 02:38.759
'Cause they are a lot.

02:38.859 --> 02:39.993
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

02:40.093 --> 02:43.363
But you are familiar
with the supernatural?

02:44.197 --> 02:46.633
‐ I feel like I can handle it.

02:46.733 --> 02:49.036
(tense music)

02:49.136 --> 02:51.605
(blood dripping)

02:58.045 --> 03:01.448
(creature screeching)

03:17.531 --> 03:20.467
(screeching)

03:30.510 --> 03:33.647
♪ 'Cause I gave you
all I got to give ♪

03:33.747 --> 03:35.515
♪ I know that ain't
no way to live ♪

03:35.615 --> 03:38.151
♪ So I told that devil ♪

03:38.251 --> 03:40.687
♪ To take you back ♪

03:40.787 --> 03:43.156
♪ I told that devil ♪

03:43.256 --> 03:45.325

03:49.029 --> 03:50.030
(Nicole): You could just start?

03:50.130 --> 03:51.598
(Waverly): But my Powerpoint!

03:51.698 --> 03:53.333
‐ They're always iconic.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.635
‐ I do put a lot of thought
into my wipes.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.370
‐ I love your wipes.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.372
And I love that you got
us all notebooks, and...

03:59.473 --> 04:00.440
‐ Where's Wynonna and Doc?

04:00.540 --> 04:02.509
‐ Oh, well, they're probably
off doing...

04:03.276 --> 04:04.778
...something like that.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.317
Meanwhile I... I came early

04:10.417 --> 04:13.854
because I am pumped
for your presentation.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.022
We've got a whack of questions.
Like...

04:16.123 --> 04:17.524
who's Cleo?
‐ Yeah. Who's Holt?

04:17.624 --> 04:19.693
‐ What's with the border?
‐ Why so many demons!

04:19.793 --> 04:21.228
‐ What's for dinner?
‐ Tacos!

04:21.328 --> 04:22.562
‐ Delicious.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.197
And what the hell happened
to Peacemaker?

04:27.033 --> 04:28.301
(Rachel clears her throat)

04:28.401 --> 04:29.269
Oh!

04:29.369 --> 04:31.705
Well, look who decided
to show her face.

04:32.939 --> 04:33.974
And in Wynonna's jacket?

04:34.074 --> 04:35.542
‐ Oh. Looks better on me.

04:35.642 --> 04:37.210
(gasps)
‐ Never say that to her.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.045
‐ So, Rachel,
we were talking about

04:39.146 --> 04:41.982
Wynonna's magic gun.
Sword. Uh...

04:42.082 --> 04:43.850
What? She lives with us.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.752
She's gonna find out
a lot worse.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.888
Here.
‐ No, no, hers is the blue one.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.923
‐ Okay, okay.
‐ I'm actually about to bounce?

04:50.023 --> 04:52.092
But... I've been here 18 months,

04:52.192 --> 04:53.026
so I get ya.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.429
I'll keep an eye out
for... a gun‐sword.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.697
(sighing)

04:59.399 --> 05:02.569
‐ Baby, I'm sorry nobody's here.

05:02.669 --> 05:05.272
‐ You're sorry we're alone
in the house?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.941
‐ Oh. No, not that.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.953
‐ For the government,
it's unprecedented.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.956
It's a chance to observe
humans and demons,

05:23.056 --> 05:24.024
co‐existing together

05:24.124 --> 05:26.092
in one controlled
and contained ecosystem.

05:26.193 --> 05:29.029
‐ You put a border around
the Ghost River Triangle,

05:29.129 --> 05:30.797
you control
who comes in and out.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.632
‐ Demons, for the most part.

05:32.732 --> 05:35.402
Ooh! Don't want them
to get out. Ever.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.838
‐ Deputy Assistant Director
Hycha and the others

05:37.938 --> 05:40.006
were called here
after the unexplained event

05:40.106 --> 05:40.874
18 months ago.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.442
‐ We arrived after
it all went down.

05:42.542 --> 05:45.745
Of course, Agent Chetri
had already been in Purgatory.

05:45.846 --> 05:46.613
‐ Mm‐hmm.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.082
‐ But the new mandate
is to observe.

05:49.182 --> 05:49.916
Not to interfere.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.484
(blows raspberry)

05:51.585 --> 05:52.986
‐ I felt pretty interfered with
last night

05:53.086 --> 05:55.155
when I was snatched
from my barn bed.

05:55.255 --> 05:58.725
‐ Well, when we go into demon
territory, we do it with oomph.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.694
‐ So, Naomi, before this,

06:00.794 --> 06:02.495
you were, what, at Roswell,

06:02.596 --> 06:04.497
wrist‐deep in alien sphincter
I suppose?

06:04.598 --> 06:07.000
‐ Oh, I was... I was...

06:07.100 --> 06:09.569
I was transferred here from
the Department of Fisheries.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.605
The Black Badge Division
had been dissolved

06:11.705 --> 06:14.674
and they were desperate
for volunteers.

06:14.774 --> 06:18.178
‐ My supervisor was the envoy
to Belize.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.146
He's gonna teach me how to surf.

06:20.981 --> 06:21.848
‐ Listen...

06:22.549 --> 06:24.684
I once lost a guy
to E. Coli

06:24.784 --> 06:27.187
after undercooked perch
at the annual fry‐up.

06:27.287 --> 06:30.190
But he was back
after a week.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.958
He'd, uh, he'd thinned out
around the face,

06:32.058 --> 06:33.460
he actually looked really great.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.096
(sighing)
But at BBD?

06:37.163 --> 06:39.132
Twelve deaths so far.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.602
You can't know what it's like
to lose someone

06:42.702 --> 06:44.671
until it happens.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.340
Ooh!

06:47.440 --> 06:48.708
But if it sweetens the pot,

06:48.808 --> 06:52.679
we have really cool jumpsuits.
Very Fleabag!

06:52.779 --> 06:54.714
‐ I don't know what that is.
‐ Wait, hmm?

06:54.814 --> 06:57.217
‐ Why don't I just
show her around,

06:57.317 --> 06:59.519
just, you know,
take her on a tour.

07:00.186 --> 07:01.688
‐ A private tour.

07:01.788 --> 07:03.456
‐ Uh, ohh...

07:03.556 --> 07:05.025
You be quick, you two.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.895
I'd love to get this
crossed off my to‐do by lunch.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.965
‐ Here's your surveillance
rock back.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.834
I'm gonna need actual
alone time with Agent Chetri.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.844
(indistinct chattering)

07:24.945 --> 07:26.513
(upbeat music)

07:29.482 --> 07:31.918
‐ To our new partnership.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.763
Ravenia's lovely.

07:43.863 --> 07:47.434
Big fan, too.
I could introduce you.

07:48.301 --> 07:52.072
‐ I am merely here
to, uh, conduct business.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.574
‐ Mmm... You know...

07:54.674 --> 07:57.577
Everybody knows
that you're Wynonna Earp's man.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.779
Or is Wynonna Earp your woman?

07:59.879 --> 08:01.781
‐ Wynonna is no one
but her own.

08:01.881 --> 08:04.284
Besides, what is it to you?
(cocking gun)

08:04.384 --> 08:05.585
‐ Stand down, big boy.

08:05.685 --> 08:07.087
(chuckling)

08:07.187 --> 08:08.922
All it is to me is interesting.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.959
You are the Earps'
most loyal protector,

08:13.059 --> 08:14.627
and yet the thing
that more recently

08:14.728 --> 08:17.030
turned your body into a weapon,

08:17.130 --> 08:20.266
most able to protect them,
you deny.

08:25.805 --> 08:29.075
Ravenia. Could you pour
Mr. Holliday here

08:29.175 --> 08:31.411
a sip of our special blend?

08:35.482 --> 08:38.051
You know, we're demons,
we all have problems.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.553
Now, you vampires are always
so melodramatic

08:40.653 --> 08:42.389
that yours are special.

08:47.293 --> 08:49.295
(growling)

08:54.134 --> 08:55.902
(sighing)

08:57.971 --> 08:59.672
You're safe here, Doc.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.442
To be who you really are.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.478
‐ There are worse people
to work for

09:05.578 --> 09:08.148
than those
who see others plainly.

09:08.748 --> 09:11.151
‐ Well, seeing that
we're being honest,

09:11.885 --> 09:14.454
if you return empty‐handed,

09:14.554 --> 09:18.191
Ravenia here will be pouring
your juices out of that jug.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.626
‐ Well then,

09:19.726 --> 09:21.995
I shall try my darndest...

09:22.929 --> 09:24.364
not to disappoint you.

09:24.464 --> 09:27.000
‐ Oh, and please,
do say hello to Wynonna.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.636
From the rest of us monsters.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.879
(eerie music)

09:47.387 --> 09:48.955
(creature growling)

09:50.390 --> 09:53.059
(screeching)

10:01.501 --> 10:03.870
‐ What do you have for me?
‐ The holy grail.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.906
‐ "Bunny Loblaw for PTA!"

10:09.709 --> 10:12.045
‐ Billy, we said we don't dive
for any more mugs.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.080
Nobody needs 'em.
‐ You know what?

10:14.180 --> 10:16.282
You're right.
(glass shattering)

10:17.517 --> 10:19.486
‐ Anything real
from today's haul?

10:19.586 --> 10:21.955
‐ I don't know. Does a DVD copy
of Bring It On count?

10:22.055 --> 10:23.790
I'm sexy! I'm cute!

10:23.890 --> 10:25.558
I found it in a boot!

10:25.658 --> 10:26.559
‐ It does not.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.662
But too bad, 'cause I have
the perfect trade.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.664
A real Billy‐find.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.833
For when y'all kill
squirrels at y'all ranch.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.468
‐ For the record,
we only eat chipmunks.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.337
But this is cool.

10:37.437 --> 10:38.638
Thanks, Rachel.

10:38.738 --> 10:40.840
‐ Well, as always, good haul.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.009
This has gone way better
than when I was alone.

10:43.109 --> 10:44.444
‐ Same.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.513
Oh, and uh...

10:46.613 --> 10:48.615
I, um, thought that...

10:49.482 --> 10:52.752
this maybe might look cool
on you.

10:52.852 --> 10:55.321
‐ You thinking about how I look?
‐ No.

10:56.756 --> 10:57.790
Yeah?

11:01.227 --> 11:02.695
‐ Hubcap for the vest?

11:02.795 --> 11:04.497
I know you guys
sell auto parts.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.966
‐ Uh, yeah.

11:09.602 --> 11:11.004
(sighing)

11:11.905 --> 11:13.940
‐ Everything is state
of the art,

11:14.040 --> 11:15.708
as you can see, we have floors,

11:15.808 --> 11:17.977
windows, couches, bathrooms.

11:18.077 --> 11:20.613
Oh! And this
is my favorite nook.

11:20.713 --> 11:21.548
Hey!

11:22.549 --> 11:24.150
‐ Whoa. You've definitely
been body‐snatched,

11:25.318 --> 11:25.552
'cause you're going for
a make‐out sesh, but honestly,

11:26.553 --> 11:28.454
I'm so relieved to see you,
I'm kinda down.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.857
‐ Still gay.
It's just...

11:31.457 --> 11:34.360
The only place
where they can't see us.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.229
‐ I knew Black Badge
was still evil.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.830
‐ The old Black Badge, yes.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.365
Naomi and co.?

11:39.465 --> 11:42.368
Just people,
scared and in over their heads.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.904
A lot of bad stuff
came into Purgatory.

11:45.004 --> 11:47.006
They need you
and your magic gun.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.543
(footsteps approaching)
‐ Okay, well, the thing about‐‐

11:50.643 --> 11:52.745
‐ Uh, hey!

11:52.845 --> 11:53.913
‐ Agent Arp?

11:54.647 --> 11:55.848
‐ No.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.219
Special Agent...

11:59.652 --> 12:00.587
Arp.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.655
‐ Arp...

12:02.755 --> 12:03.556
‐ Well, yay.

12:03.656 --> 12:06.559
And welcome back to BBD.
Fish bump?

12:08.795 --> 12:11.097
Oh. Ouch.

12:11.197 --> 12:13.032
‐ Well, enjoy the knife.

12:13.132 --> 12:15.201
Hope the chipmunks
are real good.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.838
We eat vegan
most meals, so...

12:19.272 --> 12:21.608
I'll come over to yours
for rodent sometime?

12:21.908 --> 12:23.910
‐ A lot of Earps
back home now, huh?

12:24.010 --> 12:26.779
Is that weird for you?
‐ Try insane.

12:26.879 --> 12:28.448
But I kinda love it.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.416
Never really had people before.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.920
But way to dodge me inviting
myself over to your house.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.855
‐ Yeah. That's probably
not a great idea.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.358
My place is sad.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.859
‐ Dude. I lived years in a place

12:39.959 --> 12:41.761
where my toilet
was also my kitchen.

12:41.861 --> 12:44.130
‐ It's just not really
a friends‐can‐come‐over

12:44.230 --> 12:45.531
type situation.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.567
My mom is like
a bonafide hoarder.

12:48.568 --> 12:49.669
‐ I just...

12:49.769 --> 12:52.705
Sometimes, I feel like
you're keeping me a secret.

12:53.172 --> 12:54.073
‐ Maybe someday, okay?

12:54.173 --> 12:57.210
If we can, like,
find some foolproof reason.

12:58.144 --> 12:59.779
I'll see you later,
mug lover.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.882
‐ Yeah, that's what I love.

13:02.982 --> 13:04.083
Mugs.

13:04.183 --> 13:05.585
(sighing)

13:07.520 --> 13:09.722
(tense music)

13:13.026 --> 13:14.594
(panting)

13:14.694 --> 13:15.928
‐ And we're on the floor.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.297
‐ Yeah, how did that happen?

13:17.397 --> 13:18.464
‐ Oh, determination?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.334
‐ There's a notebook
stuck to my butt.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.436
(laughing)
‐ Maybe don't give that one out.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.305
(laughing)

13:27.173 --> 13:29.475
‐ Should we talk
finding Peacemaker?

13:29.575 --> 13:32.512
What we just did
reminded me of how...

13:32.612 --> 13:35.815
good you are
at finding things.

13:36.582 --> 13:38.484
‐ Yeah. Peacemaker.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.421
Another thing I failed
at for 18 months.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.655
‐ Hey.

13:43.589 --> 13:44.824
Do I need to make
a Powerpoint presentation

13:44.924 --> 13:47.193
about how amazing
Nicole Haught is?

13:47.293 --> 13:49.529
I'd call it "Haught Topics".

13:50.396 --> 13:51.698
‐ Why would I need that?

13:53.266 --> 13:54.067
‐ Or...

13:54.167 --> 13:56.836
We could talk about

13:56.936 --> 13:58.638
another thing that...

13:58.738 --> 14:01.341
starts with "pro"

14:01.441 --> 14:03.676
and ends in "posal"?

14:06.612 --> 14:09.649
Even though the world
was ending, I meant every word.

14:09.749 --> 14:11.718
(door opening)

14:14.120 --> 14:16.389
‐ That's a lot.
‐ Jesus, Rachel!

14:16.489 --> 14:18.558
Respect the privacy of...
‐ ...the kitchen.

14:18.658 --> 14:19.759
‐ Right.
‐ Whatever.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.894
Do you think a junkyard
would be a good place

14:21.994 --> 14:22.862
to look for
a magic sword‐gun?

14:23.863 --> 14:25.465
‐ One man's trash
is another Earp's treasure!

14:25.565 --> 14:26.999
‐ Yeah. Where is this junkyard?

14:27.100 --> 14:29.535
‐ Easier if I show you.
But you're gonna need pants.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.706
‐ Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
‐ Oh, my God.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.641
(laughing

14:39.812 --> 14:43.383
‐ None of these compare to,
say, an old western Buntline

14:43.483 --> 14:45.585
that can send
revenants to hell, but...

14:45.685 --> 14:48.154
‐ Yeah, yeah, no, Peacemaker,
she slaps for sure,

14:48.254 --> 14:50.256
but these weapons also slap.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.492
I should for sure take one.
‐ One sec.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.728
First, you need to see my...

14:57.730 --> 14:58.931
...masterpiece.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.300
I call it Antoni.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.537
Because if you want to turn
something into guacamole,

15:04.637 --> 15:05.571
you bring Antoni.

15:08.941 --> 15:10.576
‐ Welcome to taco night.

15:11.944 --> 15:14.447
(upbeat Soca music)

15:29.529 --> 15:30.630
(music stops)
‐ Okay, whoa!

15:30.730 --> 15:32.131
Watch where
you point that thing!

15:32.231 --> 15:33.900
Seriously, do not point
that at anything

15:34.000 --> 15:34.867
unless you want it guac'd.

15:35.968 --> 15:38.371
‐ Though now I do want nachos.
Is there a caf or...

15:39.138 --> 15:41.307
So what's my first mish?

15:41.407 --> 15:43.376
Is this about finding
and rescuing Robin?

15:43.476 --> 15:44.777
'Cause I will, Jer.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.746
‐ It's about a problem
we're having with things

15:46.846 --> 15:49.048
robbin' our supply trucks.

15:49.148 --> 15:51.751
Our biggest challenge is getting
provisions into Purgatory

15:51.851 --> 15:54.253
without it getting hijacked,
or worse.

15:54.353 --> 15:55.655
‐ Alright. So you need me
to hunt down whatever's stealing

15:55.755 --> 15:57.924
freight and killing drivers.
Got it.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.725
‐ I need you sitting.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.227
In the truck.

16:02.528 --> 16:03.596
‐ Driving?

16:05.465 --> 16:08.568
You don't ask Cate Blanchett
to be a background extra,

16:08.668 --> 16:10.837
you make her Carol.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.840
Forget the cover,
I'm a demon hunter, man.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.508
I am Carol.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.276
‐ And I'm a scientist
with an empathetic crotch.

16:17.376 --> 16:18.377
‐ Yeah.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.514
‐ But BBD can't find out
who we really are right now.

16:21.614 --> 16:24.984
They don't like
supernatural things, Wynonna.

16:25.084 --> 16:26.018
Like us.

16:27.186 --> 16:29.655
We need to get Purgatory food.

16:29.755 --> 16:30.957
Medicine.

16:31.924 --> 16:32.792
Booze.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.760
‐ Always lead with booze.

16:35.695 --> 16:36.596
You know...

16:38.097 --> 16:40.533
Yesterday, the good citizens
of my hometown

16:40.633 --> 16:42.535
tried to hang me for murder.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.937
‐ Well ya,
they just need snacks, Wynonna.

16:45.037 --> 16:46.606
They're kinda hangry.

16:47.039 --> 16:48.341
(light music)

16:48.441 --> 16:50.276
‐ Wow, look at that sign.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.779
‐ So, wait,
this is your boyfriend's place?

16:53.880 --> 16:57.149
‐ No, this is my friend
who is a boy's place.

16:59.285 --> 17:00.820
‐ Looks promising.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.522
Unless you already
checked it out?

17:03.022 --> 17:05.391
‐ Well, I stuck mostly
to the forests.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.360
‐ Smart.

17:14.133 --> 17:15.768
‐ I'm gonna go check round back.

17:17.069 --> 17:18.037
‐ Classic teen.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.172
Doesn't want to be seen
at the creepy junkyard

17:20.273 --> 17:21.841
with her sexy gay aunts.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.183
Hello?

17:32.985 --> 17:34.053
Magpies?

17:35.321 --> 17:37.390
Junk... people?

17:38.090 --> 17:40.226
Hello?
(growling)

17:49.468 --> 17:50.536
You scared me.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.572
‐ Yeah, well, this is kinda
Spooky Central.

17:52.672 --> 17:53.773
So let's stick together, okay?

17:55.141 --> 17:57.777
‐ Hey! Get away! Do not touch!

17:58.444 --> 17:59.378
‐ Sorry.

17:59.478 --> 18:00.880
‐ Car parts in this section
ain't for sale.

18:00.980 --> 18:03.749
Don't touch none of that.
‐ Nobody's touching anything.

18:05.151 --> 18:06.986
What exactly is for sale here?

18:07.553 --> 18:08.988
‐ I'll show you.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.656
(distant dog barking)

18:10.756 --> 18:11.724
‐ Come on.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.061
(indistinct chattering)

18:16.562 --> 18:18.898
‐ You're in my seat.
‐ Simon.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.800
And hurry up. I wanna get
in and out of this shithole

18:20.900 --> 18:22.201
as fast as possible.

18:22.301 --> 18:23.769
‐ Excuse me,

18:25.004 --> 18:25.938
but the Purgatory shithole
is a rare geothermal occurrence

18:26.639 --> 18:27.340
and bonafide tourist attraction.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.275
‐ Look, okay. Hey, not driving

18:30.476 --> 18:31.310
gives you a chance to observe,
and to guard the supplies.

18:31.410 --> 18:32.378
‐ He talked shit
about our shithole.

18:32.478 --> 18:35.748
‐ You need BBD resources
to do your job.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.049
Your real job.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.952
‐ Stupid always persuasive
Jeremy.

18:40.052 --> 18:43.089
‐ And when I say this thing
is powerful, I mean it.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.323
Do you see that red button?

18:45.091 --> 18:46.025
‐ Yes.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.126
‐ Never use it.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.561
Unless it's Apocalypse Now time.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.430
And I'm not talking the movie,
I'm saying the two words,

18:51.530 --> 18:52.331
together.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.169
‐ What is with all
the disguised GPS trackers, man?

18:58.504 --> 19:00.940
‐ Oh, this...
This isn't BBD tech.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.809
‐ Maybe Waverly can dig
something up.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.811
‐ Hey. Maybe just, like,
never ever, ever

19:05.911 --> 19:06.879
press that button!

19:06.979 --> 19:09.515
God, I don't even know why
I put that in there.

19:09.615 --> 19:12.284
‐ There's the constant panic
and second‐guessing I've missed.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.886
Love you, Jer‐bear!

19:13.986 --> 19:16.122
‐ Love you.
‐ Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:16.222 --> 19:17.857
‐ No, no, no, no.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.725
Wise up, please.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.127
‐ I'm just kidding.
I won't do it.

19:21.227 --> 19:23.029
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
‐ Okay, yeah.

19:23.796 --> 19:24.563
Okay, bye.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.067
‐ Do let me know if you two
are looking for anything

19:28.167 --> 19:29.468
in particular.

19:30.269 --> 19:32.705
‐ Any vintage...

19:32.805 --> 19:34.106
(clanking, sighing)

19:34.206 --> 19:35.741
...silverware?
‐ Cutlery?

19:36.809 --> 19:38.077
Knives.

19:38.644 --> 19:39.545
‐ Little bigger.

19:39.645 --> 19:42.348
Say, swords?
‐ Planning to storm a castle?

19:42.448 --> 19:45.051
Got a princess to save?

19:45.484 --> 19:48.721
‐ Halloween costume.
I'm going as She‐Ra.

19:48.821 --> 19:49.989
‐ Oh, my God, I would die.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.391
(phone buzzing)

19:53.793 --> 19:54.927
Oh, it's Wynonna.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.328
I should probably take this.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.701
Hey, sis.
What's going on?

20:03.069 --> 20:04.437
Did you get my text?

20:05.237 --> 20:06.238
‐ Nicole.

20:06.772 --> 20:07.907
It's good to see you again.

20:08.007 --> 20:08.908
‐ Careful, Margo.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.944
‐ We've recently come into
some lovely rings,

20:12.044 --> 20:13.512
should you have a need for one.

20:13.612 --> 20:15.548
Now that your Waverly

20:15.648 --> 20:17.783
has been returned safely
to you.

20:18.484 --> 20:19.852
Which reminds me,

20:20.853 --> 20:22.388
it's time for you to deliver.

20:22.488 --> 20:23.689
‐ Stay away from us.

20:23.789 --> 20:26.292
‐ Love wins, after all.

20:27.159 --> 20:29.295
(tense music)

20:34.433 --> 20:35.201
‐ What? You're where?

20:35.301 --> 20:36.602
‐ Doing a thing in a truck.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.971
Can you just peep the symbol
on that rock real quick?

20:39.071 --> 20:40.072
‐ What truck?

20:40.172 --> 20:41.741
‐ Just... A white truck?

20:41.841 --> 20:42.708
‐ Wynonna.

20:43.342 --> 20:44.944
‐ Ugh. My sister. Pfft.

20:47.546 --> 20:49.448
Apparently, this truck
is also delivering wieners,

20:49.548 --> 20:51.650
because there's a huge one
right next to me.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.986
That's an inside joke,
it's not about you.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.122
‐ Hey, I'm actually looking
for Peacemaker.

20:56.222 --> 20:58.290
‐ Oh, my God, thank you so much,
baby girl.

20:58.390 --> 20:59.959
‐ Yeah, so whatever
one‐act play this is...

21:00.059 --> 21:01.994
‐ Just take a look
at the symbol, okay?

21:02.094 --> 21:03.095
I'll explain
the ween‐scene later.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.163
‐ Okay.

21:05.564 --> 21:06.732
Yay, research!

21:08.000 --> 21:09.535
I don't recognize it.

21:09.635 --> 21:11.170
Uh... It could be a pictograph?

21:11.270 --> 21:12.738
Or a rune?

21:13.739 --> 21:15.174
I'll look into it more
when I get home.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.009
‐ Alright, thanks Nerdely.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.077
You're the best.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.080
(tense music)

21:25.151 --> 21:26.952
(Simon): Ain't nothing out here.

21:27.887 --> 21:28.988
‐ It's beautiful.

21:30.422 --> 21:32.691
‐ Oh God, this town.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.193
Of course.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.495
(brakes squealing)

21:39.231 --> 21:40.499
‐ We should check it out.

21:40.599 --> 21:42.168
‐ We should not
get ourselves killed.

21:44.270 --> 21:45.504
‐ I can't believe
I'm saying this

21:45.604 --> 21:47.006
in the year of our lord...

21:47.506 --> 21:49.141
Whatever it is,
I've lost track.

21:49.241 --> 21:50.709
It's our job.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.480
(tailgate opening)

21:57.683 --> 22:00.352
‐ This is demon shit.

22:00.452 --> 22:01.487
‐ This is a robbery!

22:01.587 --> 22:03.956
Someone's trying
to steal our booze!

22:04.056 --> 22:05.057
And food and medicine!

22:05.157 --> 22:06.992
‐ Who cares about
these townies?!

22:07.092 --> 22:08.160
‐ I care.

22:08.727 --> 22:09.662
I actually do.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.964
Yeah, some of them
might be meatballs.

22:12.064 --> 22:14.333
‐ Mega meatballs,
if they live here.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.501
‐ But they're my meatballs.

22:16.468 --> 22:16.635
And you don't get
to call them that, wiener.

22:17.403 --> 22:18.737
I do. 'Cause I'm a Purgatorian.

22:18.838 --> 22:19.905
(Simon chuckles)

22:20.005 --> 22:21.173
‐ What a hero.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.410
And I'm sure they'll thank you
by giving you super gonorrhea

22:24.510 --> 22:26.245
when they're not trying
to string you up,

22:26.345 --> 22:28.480
and I ain't dying
for this dirt town

22:28.581 --> 22:30.282
and its dirt people.

22:32.785 --> 22:35.054
You don't even have an Arby's.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.489
‐ We have a guy named Arby!

22:38.157 --> 22:39.992
And the diaper is just 'cause
he's busy!

22:41.493 --> 22:43.762
(gun powering up)

22:43.863 --> 22:45.364
Come on, sucker.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.672
Ahh! Ooh!

22:57.776 --> 22:59.378
‐ Wynonna?
‐ Doc?

23:02.181 --> 23:03.849
‐ You're working for the BBD?

23:03.949 --> 23:04.850
‐ You're robbing stagecoaches?

23:06.518 --> 23:08.454
So. Have you seen
this Fleabag thing

23:08.554 --> 23:09.955
everyone's talking about?

23:11.523 --> 23:12.625
‐ Well, well.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.093
Professor Trash himself,

23:14.193 --> 23:15.361
putting the "man"
back in "manicure".

23:15.461 --> 23:16.195
‐ What are you doing here?

23:17.029 --> 23:17.429
‐ Do I need to sing
my hit single

23:18.297 --> 23:18.664
My Toilet Was My Kitchen
again? 'Cause...

23:19.531 --> 23:19.999
You don't need to be embarrassed
by this.

23:20.766 --> 23:23.435
‐ Are you nuts?
‐ Yeah. I am.

23:23.535 --> 23:27.072
We've gone over this.
That's why we we're... buds.

23:27.172 --> 23:29.074
‐ Okay. My mom is strict.
Okay, she's like super strict.

23:29.174 --> 23:31.310
She's not gonna get you.
‐ Okay. Chill, Bill.

23:32.611 --> 23:33.913
I only came to say that...

23:34.947 --> 23:36.982
Even if your family sucks,

23:37.082 --> 23:39.551
you don't. I think you...

23:39.652 --> 23:41.086
opposite of suck?

23:43.489 --> 23:45.557
Confessing this crush
is going great.

23:46.191 --> 23:46.825
‐ Crush?

23:50.529 --> 23:53.332
Don't say that, alright,
just not here.

23:55.167 --> 23:56.869
You have to leave, now.

23:57.903 --> 23:59.772
‐ Easier ways to say
you feel different.

24:03.409 --> 24:04.910
‐ That's not what I said.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.347
(door opening)

24:08.447 --> 24:09.848
‐ Can we go now?

24:09.949 --> 24:12.518
‐ Who's this lil' hothead?
‐ Like, right now.

24:12.618 --> 24:13.585
‐ Yeah, sure.
Whatever you want.

24:17.556 --> 24:20.259
‐ I'll keep an eye out
for any big old knives.

24:22.561 --> 24:24.430
(tense music)

24:26.265 --> 24:27.533
(door closing)

24:27.633 --> 24:29.168
‐ You saw Jeremy,
and you didn't tell me?

24:29.268 --> 24:31.470
‐ Literally just happened.
He's fine.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.839
‐ He's probably a hostage,

24:34.440 --> 24:36.842
which you just bought
into Black Badge's gas lighting.

24:36.942 --> 24:38.210
Rule number one, Wynonna,

24:38.310 --> 24:40.145
we do not work for the enemy.

24:40.245 --> 24:41.380
‐ We both know
that rule number one

24:41.480 --> 24:42.548
is triple check
the birth control,

24:42.648 --> 24:45.284
and those who live in
I'm‐robbing‐supply‐trucks‐houses

24:45.384 --> 24:46.552
shouldn't throw BBD stones.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.121
‐ And you are better than this.
With or without Peacemaker.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.190
‐ And you're better than playing
petty sidekick

24:52.057 --> 24:53.859
to some, what?
Wannabe mobster demon?

24:53.959 --> 24:56.328
‐ Says the woman
in the BBD jumpsuit,

24:56.428 --> 24:58.497
taking orders
from the same bastards

24:58.597 --> 24:59.732
that did what they did to Dolls!

24:59.832 --> 25:01.367
‐ What do you want me to do?!

25:01.467 --> 25:03.002
‐ I want you to act
like Wyatt Earp's

25:03.102 --> 25:04.269
great‐great‐granddaughter.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.171
Even if you did lose
his magic gun!

25:09.441 --> 25:10.642
Oh, balls.

25:15.814 --> 25:17.249
Whether you like it or not,

25:17.349 --> 25:19.184
I will be liberating
this whisky.

25:19.284 --> 25:21.587
‐ Ha... Wrong.

25:24.757 --> 25:26.325
Can't take me with it,
can you?

25:26.425 --> 25:29.595
‐ Oh, do not commit
such a childish act.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.563
‐ Oh, you wanna see childish?
How about this...

25:31.663 --> 25:33.399
...is childish.

25:37.636 --> 25:40.039
To prove a very adult
point, though.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.011
Very grown up...

25:47.479 --> 25:48.714
...sexy point.

25:53.519 --> 25:55.687
‐ Wynonna, give me the keys.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.156
‐ My wiener has them.

25:58.424 --> 25:59.625
Simon. The driver.

26:01.360 --> 26:04.863
Speaking of wieners, I bet you
this crates has condoms.

26:07.132 --> 26:09.501
‐ I got some tools in my car.

26:10.702 --> 26:12.438
It is up the road.

26:13.305 --> 26:14.406
I shall grab them.

26:17.276 --> 26:20.446
And I suppose I shall
liberate you too.

26:24.550 --> 26:26.118
(sighing)

26:34.393 --> 26:35.661
‐ With the wind blowing east,

26:35.761 --> 26:37.296
you can really smell
the shithole.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.802
‐ I thought you'd have
better taste.

26:43.902 --> 26:46.839
You brought Earps
onto our land.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.440
‐ Rachel isn't even an Earp.

26:48.540 --> 26:49.842
‐ Earp lover though, ain't she?

26:49.942 --> 26:52.177
You connected her to us.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.313
That's on you.
You know what's gotta happen.

26:54.413 --> 26:55.981
‐ Please. I'll make it right.

26:58.417 --> 27:01.453
‐ I found that photo
of you two in your bunk.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.822
Should come in handy
if you don't.

27:05.390 --> 27:07.659
Don't make me reap that girl.

27:11.530 --> 27:13.532
(wind howling)

27:13.632 --> 27:15.567
(shivering)

27:17.436 --> 27:18.770
‐ Another one?

27:25.911 --> 27:28.213
Okay, okay.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.149
You are not a piece of GPS tech.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.718
You... are...

27:32.818 --> 27:35.387
definitely evil
and creepy as hell.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.456
And I respect you.

27:38.056 --> 27:39.791
Let's just go our separate ways.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.226
(rock clattering)

27:41.326 --> 27:43.162
(wind howling)

27:46.298 --> 27:47.833
(scraping)

27:53.238 --> 27:55.874
Not footsteps. Just wind.

27:57.142 --> 27:59.478
(scraping, chain clattering)

28:06.785 --> 28:09.021
So much wind
you could poop your pants.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.191
Doc?

28:13.325 --> 28:14.526
Doc!

28:14.626 --> 28:16.995
(radio static)

28:18.530 --> 28:20.432
(soft music playing)

28:20.532 --> 28:22.668
♪ Oh what a thrill ♪

28:22.768 --> 28:24.603
♪ Thrill, thrill ♪

28:24.703 --> 28:27.072
♪ Ooh wee ♪

28:27.940 --> 28:29.575
♪ What a thrill ♪

28:29.675 --> 28:30.943
I know you.

28:33.278 --> 28:34.446
And you know me.

28:35.847 --> 28:37.049
Shit.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.953
♪ Yet such a thrill ♪

28:41.053 --> 28:43.288
♪ Is a passing thing ♪

28:44.189 --> 28:45.424

Doc!

28:45.524 --> 28:47.593
(tense music)

28:47.693 --> 28:48.894
(screeching)

28:48.994 --> 28:51.863
Ahh!

28:55.667 --> 28:58.337
Doc! ense music)

29:01.173 --> 29:02.774
(growling)

29:02.874 --> 29:03.875
(screeching)

29:03.976 --> 29:05.744
(slashing, screaming)

29:07.913 --> 29:10.215
Oh stretch, you stupid bitch!

29:10.315 --> 29:11.617
(shrieking)

29:11.717 --> 29:13.452
Oh, you're gonna regret that!

29:13.552 --> 29:16.255
Oh, you brought claws
to a guac fight.

29:17.856 --> 29:18.690
Ahh!

29:19.258 --> 29:20.225
(gasping)

29:24.329 --> 29:26.331
(shrieking)

29:29.501 --> 29:31.069
(sighing)

29:31.169 --> 29:32.738
(door opening)
(Billy): Aren't you cold?

29:34.039 --> 29:35.974
‐ Decided against layering up
with the suede vest

29:36.074 --> 29:37.442
some dick gave me.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.444
‐ Well, leather jacket's
cooler anyway.

29:40.178 --> 29:41.480
‐ It's not even mine.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.282
Just like everything else
in this place.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.319
(scoffs)
Okay.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.321
‐ I came to tell you that
we can't hang out anymore.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.189
‐ And you wanted me
to hold your hand

29:51.290 --> 29:52.658
through dumping me?

29:52.758 --> 29:54.393
Not like we were anything.

29:54.493 --> 29:55.927
"Were" being the important part.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.635
‐ You've been marked.

30:03.735 --> 30:05.304
‐ By a rock with a big "C"?

30:05.404 --> 30:06.838
It was just in the pocket
of my jacket.

30:06.938 --> 30:08.340
‐ She marked you. But...

30:08.440 --> 30:10.342
But, I said I was gonna
make it right.

30:10.442 --> 30:11.743
I want to make it right!

30:12.577 --> 30:13.945
(intense music)

30:14.046 --> 30:16.415
(panting)

30:25.924 --> 30:27.526
‐ What the fucking fuck.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.028
‐ Geological?

30:30.128 --> 30:31.496
A fossil?

30:31.596 --> 30:33.765
Are you from the Badlands?

30:33.865 --> 30:35.634
Rocks R Us?

30:35.734 --> 30:36.902
Old west.

30:37.602 --> 30:39.004
Cattle brand?

30:44.176 --> 30:45.877
It is a cattle brand!

30:45.977 --> 30:47.979
This infamous family
of cattle rustlers

30:48.080 --> 30:50.349
were on the opposing side
of the Earps

30:50.449 --> 30:52.851
during the shootout
at the O. K. Corral.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.322
"C" for Clantons.

30:59.057 --> 31:00.625
The Clantons are in Purgatory!

31:00.726 --> 31:02.060
(woman screaming)

31:04.930 --> 31:06.164
‐ Do you see the Reaper?

31:06.264 --> 31:07.733
If it's coming for you,
you can see it!

31:07.833 --> 31:09.368
‐ What are you talking about,
a Reaper?

31:09.468 --> 31:10.669
‐ Stay back, for your own good!
Stay back!

31:10.769 --> 31:11.937
It's here,
it's gotta be here!

31:12.037 --> 31:14.573
And it's not gonna stop
'til it shreds her!

31:16.808 --> 31:18.343
‐ What the hell is this place?

31:22.948 --> 31:25.350
(whimpering)

31:31.456 --> 31:33.392
(whimpering)

31:36.161 --> 31:37.829
It's the killing floor.

31:39.264 --> 31:41.366
It led me right
to the killing floor.

31:52.344 --> 31:53.445
(growling)

31:57.916 --> 31:59.885
‐ There was blood at the truck!

32:00.986 --> 32:02.254
‐ Doc!

32:02.854 --> 32:04.589
Shoot it!
‐ Shoot what?

32:04.689 --> 32:06.258
There is only you!
‐ Shoot!

32:06.358 --> 32:07.359
Right there! Shoot!

32:08.026 --> 32:09.060
‐ I cannot see it!

32:09.161 --> 32:10.529
‐ I don't have my gun!

32:11.630 --> 32:13.432
‐ You have me, and mine.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.101
(growling)

32:17.202 --> 32:18.370
‐ There!

32:18.470 --> 32:19.604
There! No!

32:22.507 --> 32:23.308
Now!

32:23.408 --> 32:25.944
(gunfire, shrieking)

32:33.718 --> 32:34.886
(Wynonna crying)

32:36.655 --> 32:38.657
(intense music)

32:47.132 --> 32:48.567
It didn't work.

32:48.667 --> 32:49.901
It's still coming!

32:54.840 --> 32:57.142
‐ It is high time
we leave this place!

32:59.711 --> 33:01.413
‐ No! No, it's not gonna
like that!

33:01.513 --> 33:03.248
‐ Yeah, well, I do not like it!

33:05.016 --> 33:06.651
(Reaper shrieking)

33:07.385 --> 33:08.520
‐ Stay the hell away from her!

33:08.620 --> 33:09.421
‐ No! Don't hurt him!

33:09.521 --> 33:10.956
There's something
wrong with him!

33:11.056 --> 33:12.324
‐ What's wrong is my family.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.926
‐ Clanton. You're a Clanton.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.962
‐ We're poison, cursed.

33:17.662 --> 33:18.830
Always have been.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.933
But I'm not going
to hurt you.

33:26.872 --> 33:28.340
‐ What is he doing?

33:28.440 --> 33:30.008
What are you doing? Billy!

33:30.108 --> 33:31.576
Please, help him!

33:31.676 --> 33:32.844
Billy, what are you doing?!

33:32.944 --> 33:34.846
(screaming)

33:34.946 --> 33:36.414
(Reaper shrieking)

33:40.352 --> 33:42.220
(Waverly): Oh, my God!

33:48.727 --> 33:51.162
(high‐pitched calling)

33:52.764 --> 33:53.865
‐ A soul for a soul.

33:53.965 --> 33:55.700
My soul for her soul.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.637
We are rooted together,
enemies and kin.

33:58.737 --> 34:01.273
But I sever that root,
and I offer myself.

34:02.674 --> 34:05.110
(groaning)

34:10.782 --> 34:12.684
(shrieking)

34:14.085 --> 34:15.620
‐ We must keep moving.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.122
‐ It's okay, it's okay.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.858
It's gone.

34:20.425 --> 34:21.726
It hated me, Doc.

34:23.528 --> 34:25.463
It hates me so much.

34:29.935 --> 34:31.570
‐ I am here, my love.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.039
I got you.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.242
I got you.

34:37.342 --> 34:38.543
‐ What did you do?

34:38.643 --> 34:40.478
Idiot, what did you do?

34:41.613 --> 34:43.148
‐ I have one covenant.

34:43.481 --> 34:45.183
I used it for you.

34:45.283 --> 34:46.051
You're safe now.

34:47.819 --> 34:50.589
‐ From what?
What is she safe from?

34:50.689 --> 34:53.525
‐ The black sheep in a family
that I don't wanna be a part of.

34:53.992 --> 34:55.260
‐ How many of you are there?

34:55.360 --> 34:58.129
‐ My brother, Holt,
sister, Cleo. And Mam.

34:59.164 --> 35:01.099
Oh God, Mam.

35:02.067 --> 35:03.301
And the others.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.070
They'll never stop
coming for you.

35:05.503 --> 35:07.105
‐ I don't understand.

35:08.506 --> 35:10.675
‐ I think that you
opposite‐of‐suck too.

35:14.179 --> 35:15.580
Bye, Rachel.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.387
‐ Okay, shh shh, it's okay.

35:22.487 --> 35:24.222
(Rachel crying)

35:26.825 --> 35:28.360
(distant howling)

35:28.460 --> 35:29.761
‐ Okay, so...

35:29.861 --> 35:30.929
We have more questions
than ever,

35:31.029 --> 35:35.000
but thanks to Billy,
some answers.

35:35.467 --> 35:38.303
The hunter, that only
Wynonna could see,

35:38.403 --> 35:39.971
it is under the sway
of Wyatt Earp's

35:40.071 --> 35:41.606
greatest enemies.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.409
‐ "C" For Clantons.

35:44.509 --> 35:45.810
‐ I always knew
they were a plague

35:45.910 --> 35:48.146
for which there is no cure.

35:48.246 --> 35:50.982
‐ Yeah, a disease that's already
spread all over town.

35:51.082 --> 35:52.217
‐ The town they're running.

35:52.317 --> 35:55.487
‐ Sheriff Holt and Cocaine Cleo
are Clantons?

35:55.587 --> 35:56.421
‐ Billy's brother and sister.

35:56.521 --> 35:59.157
‐ And that creature
answers to them.

35:59.257 --> 36:01.126
‐ They sent it after me,
specifically.

36:01.226 --> 36:02.794
That's why only I could see it.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.231
It hated me a lot.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.299
‐ Our bullets did nothing.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.135
‐ No, what stopped it
was what happened here,

36:10.235 --> 36:11.503
with Rachel's... friend.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.238
‐ He thought it was coming
for me.

36:14.072 --> 36:15.840
I found a rock in my jacket.

36:15.940 --> 36:16.941
‐ You mean...

36:18.209 --> 36:19.210
You mean, my jacket.

36:19.310 --> 36:21.913
‐ Billy ceremonied
and sacrificed something for me.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.114
And I wasn't even
really the target?

36:23.214 --> 36:25.316
‐ His emergency dental work
somehow called off

36:25.417 --> 36:26.217
the Clantons' pet.

36:26.317 --> 36:28.887
‐ Reaper.
Billy called it a Reaper.

36:32.590 --> 36:34.292
He saved you.
We have to save him.

36:34.392 --> 36:35.427
‐ No, we will. Eventually.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.529
But for now, everyone stay
the hell away from them

36:37.629 --> 36:38.730
until we can come up
with a plan.

36:39.964 --> 36:42.033
‐ I got a plan. Stab and stab
until I make his family pay.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.835
‐ We will get him,

36:43.968 --> 36:44.969
help him. Okay?

36:45.070 --> 36:47.138
‐ Yeah, but we do things here
as a team.

36:47.238 --> 36:49.774
‐ I work better alone.
Always have.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.976
‐ You don't work at all.
You're 17 years old.

36:53.445 --> 36:54.512
‐ Wait.
‐ Hey.

36:54.612 --> 36:56.014
‐ Just let her go, guys.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.249
She's earned the right
to be that pissed.

36:58.349 --> 37:00.452
But we have bigger things
to worry about.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.021
Like, we work as a team
and part of our team is missing.

37:03.955 --> 37:05.323
Let's get our nerd back.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.225
‐ Okay. So...

37:07.325 --> 37:08.460
How do we get Jeremy
away from the border,

37:08.560 --> 37:10.862
and Black Badge?
‐ We tell the truth.

37:12.630 --> 37:13.865
Then we beg.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.769
(chains clattering, grunting)

37:21.806 --> 37:23.475
(Billy): Argh!

37:24.642 --> 37:25.910
‐ Look what you've done
to yourself.

37:26.010 --> 37:27.579
My sweet baby boy.

37:27.679 --> 37:30.181
All for an Earp lover.
What a waste.

37:30.281 --> 37:32.650
‐ Stop! You don't have
to do this, okay?

37:32.751 --> 37:34.519
Just let the old ways die.

37:34.619 --> 37:36.554
‐ If we do not honor our past,

37:36.654 --> 37:38.389
we lose our future.

37:38.490 --> 37:40.759
‐ Don't kill her,
Mam, please.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.927
‐ For that whore?
Death would be a mercy.

37:43.027 --> 37:44.863
But I'm not going
to kill Rachel.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.266
(whistling)

37:53.338 --> 37:54.372
You are.

37:54.472 --> 37:56.841
(intense music)

37:58.476 --> 38:00.745
(Billy screaming)

38:17.695 --> 38:19.130
‐ Billy's a kid.)

38:19.230 --> 38:20.765
He's impulsive.

38:20.865 --> 38:22.534
‐ He'll thank me for this
one day.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.636
‐ Yeag, Mam, I mean,
Billy messed up.

38:24.736 --> 38:27.806
But we can teach him, you know,
to respect tradition.

38:27.906 --> 38:31.109
‐ Because, dear daughter,
you're so loyal to tradition.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.645
Shall we begin?

38:33.745 --> 38:35.480
(Billy screaming)

38:36.014 --> 38:37.282
‐ While he's still out there?

38:38.183 --> 38:40.652
(soft eerie music)

38:43.988 --> 38:45.857
‐ Look, come on. Why do we even
still say this stuff?

38:45.957 --> 38:47.826
It's not like it helped
any other Clanton.

38:48.526 --> 38:50.595
(Billy screaming)

38:50.695 --> 38:52.497
(Reaper growling)

38:56.801 --> 38:58.670
Ah! Ow!

38:58.770 --> 39:00.505
Ow! You're hurting me!

39:00.605 --> 39:03.174
‐ Billy's not the only one
who's impulsive.

39:03.274 --> 39:04.509
‐ Mam...
(Cleo screaming)

39:04.609 --> 39:06.578
Mam, easy. Easy!

39:07.312 --> 39:10.081
‐ You needed some Clanton blood
for something?

39:10.181 --> 39:12.116
Those reapers are not
attack dogs.

39:12.217 --> 39:13.117
They're our ancestors!

39:13.218 --> 39:14.419
(screaming)

39:16.254 --> 39:17.822
‐ You sent Uncle Ike after her?

39:17.922 --> 39:20.658
‐ Wynonna is weak. It is time!

39:20.758 --> 39:21.492
‐ Time?

39:21.593 --> 39:24.095
To go against me?
‐ No, no.

39:24.195 --> 39:27.532
‐ Do you all forget
who the Clanton heir is?

39:27.632 --> 39:28.967
(Cleo screaming)
‐ You are, Mam.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.035
‐ Who? Who?
‐ You! You are! You are!

39:31.135 --> 39:32.503
You are!

39:33.538 --> 39:35.640
‐ And I alone dictate

39:35.740 --> 39:38.343
when we unleash hell
on the Earps.

39:38.443 --> 39:39.878
‐ Yes, Mam. Yes, Mam.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.379
‐ My plan is already in motion.

39:41.479 --> 39:43.648
‐ Ow, ow, ow!

39:50.555 --> 39:52.323
‐ Now, who's hungry?

39:55.260 --> 39:56.461
(sighing)

40:08.840 --> 40:10.575
(Cleo crying)

40:12.911 --> 40:15.580
(all): We thank our kin
for this feast,

40:15.680 --> 40:18.049
and for the sin that roots us.

40:18.650 --> 40:22.086
The power of vengeance
will damn our enemies.

40:22.186 --> 40:24.355
In the name of Clanton,

40:24.455 --> 40:26.925
we vow to never forsaken.

40:27.025 --> 40:28.693
Never forget.

40:28.793 --> 40:30.728
And never forgive.

40:32.497 --> 40:34.599
(intense music)

40:37.568 --> 40:39.537
‐ You can't just barge in, Arp!

40:39.637 --> 40:42.240
‐ Earp. Wynonna Fucking Earp.

40:42.340 --> 40:46.711
I am the best damn demon hunter
that Black Badge ever saw.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.247
I'm Carol!

40:49.347 --> 40:51.282
‐ Look, Wynonna,
you don't get it‐‐

40:51.382 --> 40:53.718
‐ No, you don't get it.
I'm done lying.

40:54.686 --> 40:55.486
I'm done hiding.

40:55.586 --> 40:58.022
But I just got beat
by something...

40:58.856 --> 41:00.792
...extremely balls‐deep scary.

41:00.892 --> 41:01.793
‐ You okay?

41:02.860 --> 41:05.029
‐ Jeremy,
I don't have Peacemaker.

41:05.997 --> 41:07.465
‐ Oy. That ain't kosher.

41:07.565 --> 41:09.534
‐ All I have is my people.

41:10.668 --> 41:12.403
I need you back, Jeremy.

41:14.939 --> 41:17.742
You, and Robin if he's here.

41:18.343 --> 41:21.412
‐ He's safe.
Just keep him out of this, okay?

41:22.046 --> 41:23.781
‐ I need everybody.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.285
So here's what's happens next,
Blue Tang Jan.

41:27.385 --> 41:30.288
‐ Wait, is that a fish joke?
‐ I leave here with Jeremy.

41:30.388 --> 41:32.557
Together, we take back
the Black Badge offices

41:32.657 --> 41:34.826
in Purgatory, we reinstate
my posse of dipshits,

41:34.926 --> 41:37.061
and we hunt some goddamn demons.

41:37.528 --> 41:38.997
‐ It's just,
it's not that simple.

41:39.097 --> 41:40.331
‐ It can be.

41:40.431 --> 41:41.666
Think of me like a goldfish.

41:41.766 --> 41:42.967
Dumb and determined.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.403
‐ Agent...

41:45.503 --> 41:46.838
Agent Earp.

41:47.739 --> 41:49.807
Our bosses expect results.

41:50.475 --> 41:52.310
And if you think
I'm afraid of demons,

41:52.410 --> 41:54.512
just wait until you meet
upper management.

41:56.914 --> 41:59.484
This is your call,
Agent Chetri.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.352
‐ They can get it done.

42:02.720 --> 42:03.988
With my help.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.326
‐ This team of yours
must be pretty special.

42:09.761 --> 42:10.695
‐ The best.

42:16.901 --> 42:18.770
‐ Came to your senses
in the nick of time.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.471
‐ Mm‐mm.
‐ You bring what's due?

42:20.571 --> 42:23.007
‐ I'm giving it back.
Because I owe you nothing.

42:23.107 --> 42:25.410
‐ Ha‐ha! Is that
how you figure it?

42:25.943 --> 42:28.613
‐ Doc and Waverly got themselves
out of the garden. Not you.

42:28.713 --> 42:29.614
‐ Come on.

42:29.714 --> 42:32.216
You may be dumbstruck
for that Earp tart,

42:32.316 --> 42:33.718
but you're not an idiot.

42:33.818 --> 42:35.053
‐ It's over.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.790
‐ Oh, honey.

42:40.291 --> 42:41.626
It's just beginning.

42:43.094 --> 42:45.596
(intense music)

42:50.435 --> 42:51.903
(gasping)
