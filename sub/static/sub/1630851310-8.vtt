WEBVTT

00:06.100 --> 00:08.099
I've been in a dark place.

00:08.123 --> 00:10.523
But thanks to you and
Cara I have a life now.

00:10.900 --> 00:12.580
You bring this in to my house?

00:12.580 --> 00:13.620
Are you mad?

00:14.220 --> 00:15.900
I can't keep covering for you Ryan.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.380
And yet that's exactly
what I did for you.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.000
I'm laying everything
we have on this one.

00:19.300 --> 00:20.340
OK.

00:20.340 --> 00:22.740
You win and I'll clear my
debt with Miss Lloyd.

00:22.740 --> 00:23.940
What if it happens again?

00:23.940 --> 00:24.980
It won't!

00:24.980 --> 00:25.980
You don't know that.

00:25.820 --> 00:26.900
Ok!

00:26.900 --> 00:27.900
Just think about it.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.800
If not she's really going
to hurt me this time.

00:30.440 --> 00:31.480
Simone?

00:31.480 --> 00:32.680
This is DI Lisa Brodie.

00:32.680 --> 00:34.600
Do you two know each
other from before?

00:34.600 --> 00:35.800
In a manner of speaking...

00:35.800 --> 00:37.960
I'm sorry to tell you that
your brother was...

00:37.960 --> 00:39.000
Kieran's dead.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.040
I know.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.040
Noah was having sex
with his brother's wife?

00:44.160 --> 00:45.200
It looks that way.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.740
Someone steals a car, drives
the body to an abandoned building.

00:48.740 --> 00:51.140
Drags the body upstairs,
and throws it off the roof.

00:51.140 --> 00:54.260
Where by accident it lands
on the roof of a car being nicked.

00:54.260 --> 00:55.780
For the second time that night.

00:55.780 --> 00:57.460
Did Ryan do this to you, Dad?

00:57.460 --> 00:59.100
Don't judge him, son.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.740
He'll be too knackered to do two
fights in an evening.

01:01.740 --> 01:02.780
Bets are already in.

01:02.780 --> 01:03.980
We've got a full house.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.900
Either you get him
to show up tonight.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.820
Or we will.

01:07.820 --> 01:09.380
You can't take any more.

01:09.380 --> 01:11.140
You need to pull out.

01:11.140 --> 01:13.060
Ben, get up!

01:13.060 --> 01:15.180
I didn't mean to....

01:15.180 --> 01:22.220
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.580
Initial thoughts.

02:04.580 --> 02:09.500
Yeah, we've tyre
tracks coming in here.

02:09.500 --> 02:15.980
Vehicle follows this line in.

02:15.980 --> 02:17.900
Two prominent tyre marks here.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.340
See those marks, On his jumper.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.580
Could be from a vehicle.

02:20.580 --> 02:23.260
Got a handprint here.

02:23.260 --> 02:26.540
Blood smears and dragmarks.

02:26.540 --> 02:28.020
Ben was clearly injured...

02:28.020 --> 02:29.700
Maybe he couldn t walk
and dragged himself

02:29.700 --> 02:31.780
over to the container.

02:31.780 --> 02:36.380
Which is consistent with the injury
to his right knee.

02:36.380 --> 02:40.420
If he was crushed by a car
then I think it was a

02:40.420 --> 02:41.660
controlled impact.

02:41.660 --> 02:44.060
Otherwise there'd be loads Of debris
everywhere and there's none.

02:44.060 --> 02:46.460
We'll be able to tell more
from his internal injuries.

02:46.460 --> 02:47.500
After the post mortem.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.540
Why was Ben here?

02:48.540 --> 02:51.100
And where was he coming from?

02:51.100 --> 02:54.260
The soles of his shoes are layered
with different types of soil.

02:54.260 --> 02:58.580
So it s possible he ran
through the surrounding fields.

02:58.580 --> 02:59.980
So, we could trace his steps?

02:59.980 --> 03:01.020
Yeah.

03:01.020 --> 03:03.420
I can send up a drone,
map out the area

03:03.420 --> 03:04.500
and take some samples.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.860
Analysing the soil under his
shoes could give us an

03:06.860 --> 03:11.220
indication of the direction
he was coming from.

03:11.220 --> 03:13.380
Fists heavily bruised.

03:13.380 --> 03:16.460
There s a well demarcated band
of bruising and soft tissue injury

03:16.460 --> 03:19.780
across the anterior
aspect of the chest.

03:19.780 --> 03:22.180
Which together with the multiple rib
fractures could be consistent

03:22.180 --> 03:28.860
with a sustained crushing injury.

03:36.260 --> 03:38.900
Fresh bruising and lacerations
on the thighs and extensive area

03:38.900 --> 03:46.660
of skin loss and abrasions over
the front of the right knee.

03:54.420 --> 03:57.380
Fractured right lateral malleolus.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.420
So we ve got the multiple
rib fractures,

04:09.420 --> 04:10.780
penetration of the pleurae...

04:10.780 --> 04:14.460
Flail chest with extensive lung
contusions and lacerations...

04:14.460 --> 04:17.900
Large bilateral haemothoraces...

04:17.900 --> 04:19.540
The internal injuries
suggest that death

04:19.540 --> 04:25.340
would probably have been fairly
rapid but not instantaneous.

04:25.340 --> 04:32.140
He would have suffered.

04:36.060 --> 04:43.580
Hi this
is Ryan, leave a message.

04:43.580 --> 04:45.740
You could have killed Dad.

04:45.740 --> 04:48.260
Do you realise that?

04:48.260 --> 04:51.060
Did that thought ever
enter your thick skull?

04:51.060 --> 04:56.020
Before you...

04:56.020 --> 04:58.460
I'm gonna give you a
chance to come in Ryan.

04:58.460 --> 04:59.500
One chance.

04:59.500 --> 05:05.580
Then I'm coming after you.

05:05.580 --> 05:11.820
Briefing's about to start.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.900
The soil found on Ben s
trousers, under his shoes

05:15.900 --> 05:17.100
and under his fingernails
is

05:17.100 --> 05:21.180
indeed loam soil, ideal
for potato farming.

05:21.180 --> 05:23.860
And only one of the nearby
fields is used for growing

05:23.860 --> 05:25.340
potatoes...

05:25.340 --> 05:27.260
Erm, maris piper, actually,
really great for making

05:27.260 --> 05:31.700
crisps...

05:31.700 --> 05:35.380
So it s most likely
that he crossed through there.

05:35.380 --> 05:40.540
From his trouser legs
I also recovered

05:40.540 --> 05:43.900
the same diatoms found
on Kieran s shoes and

05:43.900 --> 05:44.940
in his nostrils.

05:44.940 --> 05:47.340
So it's most likely
They were on the same farm.

05:47.340 --> 05:48.380
Now.

05:48.380 --> 05:50.060
In the vicinity there
are three farms.

05:50.060 --> 05:51.100
Two are abandoned.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.260
By taking samples from
each of them we can

05:53.260 --> 05:56.220
locate the correct one.

05:57.380 --> 06:00.340
Good job, Simone.

06:06.140 --> 06:09.100
Elm Tree Farm.

06:50.620 --> 06:52.260
Looks like someone
was having a party.

06:52.260 --> 06:53.340
Not a party.

06:53.340 --> 06:55.100
Fighting.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.540
A boxing match?

06:56.540 --> 06:57.620
A bare knuckle fight.

06:57.620 --> 06:59.260
It explains the abnormally
heavy bruising on

06:59.260 --> 07:01.260
Ben Coogan s knuckles.

07:01.260 --> 07:03.820
And Kieran Johnson s as well.

07:03.820 --> 07:04.860
Blood?

07:04.860 --> 07:07.100
Looks like it.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.980
White towel, possibly
of a cotton/synthetic mixture.

07:09.980 --> 07:12.020
The fibres found in Kieran s lungs?

07:12.020 --> 07:17.500
Could it have been
used to suffocate him?

07:17.500 --> 07:19.660
Could well be Too early
to say for certain.

07:19.660 --> 07:27.620
But we know he was in the area
at some point close to his death.

07:29.460 --> 07:32.420
Jack.

07:57.420 --> 07:59.060
What is it?

07:59.060 --> 08:00.140
Looks like blood and...

08:00.140 --> 08:02.300
A colouring of some kind.

08:02.300 --> 08:04.020
Ink.

08:04.020 --> 08:06.980
Could be ink.

08:07.260 --> 08:10.580
The farm has been in
disuse for five years.

08:10.580 --> 08:13.180
Previous owner died
and it was inherited by his son, who

08:13.180 --> 08:14.220
lives in New York.

08:14.220 --> 08:16.620
He claims to be unaware
of the premises being used

08:16.620 --> 08:19.540
as a boxing venue.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.500
Excuse me for a minute.

08:25.860 --> 08:30.140
Cause of death was multiple
compressive chest injuries.

08:30.140 --> 08:31.260
Find anything else?

08:31.260 --> 08:33.900
There was ointment on Ben's skin
and THG in his urine,

08:33.900 --> 08:36.060
known as the Cream
and the Clear in boxing

08:36.060 --> 08:37.060
parlance.

08:37.060 --> 08:38.140
Steroids.

08:38.140 --> 08:40.580
Performance enhancers.

08:40.580 --> 08:43.700
Yeah so given the rib fractures
of various ages, and the old hand

08:43.700 --> 08:45.420
fractures.

08:45.420 --> 08:47.820
My guess is that he'd been
in bare knuckle fighting

08:47.820 --> 08:50.100
for quite some time.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.580
Underground bare knuckle fighting
often involves betting large sums

08:52.580 --> 08:55.940
of money.

08:55.940 --> 08:57.820
Interestingly, thirty years
ago, an up and coming

08:57.820 --> 08:58.900
boxer was arrested in

08:58.900 --> 09:01.980
a police raid on a
bare knuckle fight.

09:01.980 --> 09:04.900
The boxer s name: Michelle Lafferty.

09:20.300 --> 09:27.420
We re sorry for your
loss, Ms Lafferty.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.260
Lee Coogan isn't
answering his phone.

09:34.260 --> 09:39.060
Have you seen him?

09:39.060 --> 09:41.700
Were you aware Ben Coogan
was involved in illegal bare knuckle

09:41.700 --> 09:43.580
fighting?

09:43.580 --> 09:45.260
Who organised the fights?

09:45.260 --> 09:52.460
I have no idea what Ben was up
to outside the walls of this gym.

09:59.580 --> 10:01.100
Hello?

10:01.100 --> 10:03.180
Is Dad OK?

10:03.180 --> 10:04.220
I...

10:04.220 --> 10:05.660
I didn t mean to hit him...

10:05.660 --> 10:07.820
Just tell me where
you are and I ll come

10:07.820 --> 10:08.860
Get you.

10:08.860 --> 10:10.780
Why were there paternity
tests in the drawer?

10:10.780 --> 10:12.940
Because a while ago
you asked me to find

10:12.940 --> 10:14.380
out if you were Cara s father.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.420
That's why.

10:15.420 --> 10:17.380
I told you not to run that test!

10:17.380 --> 10:19.740
Why was your swab in there too?

10:19.740 --> 10:22.860
Just come home and
we ll talk about it.

10:22.860 --> 10:25.820
See, that s the problem,
right there.

10:25.820 --> 10:31.220
Never a straight answer.

10:31.220 --> 10:34.540
Ryan?

10:34.540 --> 10:37.420
30 years ago, you were arrested
because of your participation in an

10:37.420 --> 10:40.580
illegal bare knuckle fight.

10:40.580 --> 10:43.260
Oh, God.

10:43.260 --> 10:45.260
You re dredging up that garbage now?

10:45.260 --> 10:48.140
You weren't charged, but word got
out that you had been using

10:48.140 --> 10:55.660
performance enhancing steroids.

10:55.660 --> 11:02.020
When I started boxing it was illegal
in the UK for women.

11:02.020 --> 11:03.700
Right?

11:03.700 --> 11:05.860
When I trained, I was
spat at and called

11:05.860 --> 11:06.900
a lesbian.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.100
No gym would have me.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.260
So the only fights
I could get were bare

11:10.260 --> 11:12.700
knuckle, against
bastards twice my size.

11:12.700 --> 11:15.580
So, forgive me if I used any
means possible to gain an

11:15.580 --> 11:17.820
advantage.

11:17.820 --> 11:23.300
Did you introduce Ben to steroids
and illegal bare knuckle fighting?

11:23.300 --> 11:25.580
I did everything I
could to not let him

11:25.580 --> 11:33.540
make the same mistakes!

11:34.380 --> 11:41.140
Now get out, the pair of you,
and let me finish this in peace.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.900
They ve gone.

11:50.900 --> 11:55.500
We're going to find Vanessa Lloyd.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.300
You don t know if she killed Ben.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.740
Who else could it have been?

11:58.740 --> 12:00.900
You don t even know
how to get to her.

12:00.900 --> 12:05.300
You are going to help me...

12:05.300 --> 12:11.140
It s the least you can
do for your brother.

12:11.140 --> 12:12.740
Now go and clean yourself up.

12:12.740 --> 12:15.700
Go on.

12:37.860 --> 12:40.620
Police!

12:40.620 --> 12:45.300
Anybody here?

12:45.300 --> 12:52.140
Lee Coogan?

13:03.420 --> 13:04.460
Painkillers.

13:04.460 --> 13:05.500
Strong ones.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.540
Not paying their bills.

13:06.540 --> 13:08.060
Final notice on rent...

13:08.060 --> 13:14.540
Threats to cut off
gas, electricity...

13:14.700 --> 13:21.580
Jack.

13:23.820 --> 13:26.580
I ll suit up.

13:38.340 --> 13:39.980
The victim was strapped
to the chair.

13:39.980 --> 13:42.940
Then he was tortured...

13:51.060 --> 13:54.460
At some point he freed himself...

13:54.460 --> 13:57.420
..or he was let go.

14:02.460 --> 14:10.420
Hand.

14:23.460 --> 14:30.020
He made makeshift bandages.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.940
I think we know where
Lee Coogan lost his digits.

14:36.940 --> 14:44.900
But where is he now?

14:47.620 --> 14:49.780
Car park security reported
the car to police.

14:49.780 --> 14:56.780
Registered to Lee Coogan.

14:57.780 --> 15:04.860
Car was hotwired.

15:07.780 --> 15:15.740
Fibres.

15:16.220 --> 15:18.140
Could this be the car
that crushed Ben?

15:18.140 --> 15:26.100
Very likely.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.460
Maybe Ben Coogan pressed his

15:28.460 --> 15:33.660
hands against the bonnet
as he was crushed.

15:33.660 --> 15:34.820
Simone?

15:34.820 --> 15:37.900
Anything?

15:37.900 --> 15:40.300
Some of the mud here,
at first sight, seems to

15:40.300 --> 15:41.780
correspond with the farm.

15:41.780 --> 15:44.740
But there's definitely
something else here.

15:44.740 --> 15:48.700
Look, smell that.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.580
Yeah, soiled nappy.

15:51.580 --> 15:53.020
It s something with
high organic content.

15:53.020 --> 15:58.140
Could be clay from a lake.

15:58.140 --> 16:00.780
But then there's also some salt
encrustations here, meaning it could

16:00.780 --> 16:01.820
be marine related.

16:01.820 --> 16:03.260
So we're looking at a mix.

16:03.260 --> 16:04.300
OK.

16:04.300 --> 16:05.780
Lis?

16:05.780 --> 16:07.700
Gran wants to know
if you're still up

16:07.700 --> 16:15.020
for dinner tomorrow night?

16:15.020 --> 16:17.500
Can we just focus on the work?

16:17.500 --> 16:25.460
Aye-aye, Captain.

16:33.820 --> 16:36.620
Have you ever been in a relationship
with someone that you know isn t

16:36.620 --> 16:37.660
working...

16:37.660 --> 16:40.540
..but you still love the person
and you don t want to throw

16:40.540 --> 16:42.180
everything away.

16:42.180 --> 16:44.460
Mm...maybe.

16:44.460 --> 16:48.300
Lisa got a posting in Australia.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.140
We re moving...

16:50.140 --> 16:51.580
But you re not sure about it?

16:51.580 --> 16:53.780
I...

16:53.780 --> 16:58.740
Well, I really feel like I should
go with her, but...

16:58.740 --> 17:02.180
I'm in a long distance relationship.

17:02.180 --> 17:03.420
Matt's an amazing guy.

17:03.420 --> 17:06.260
But he lives in Washington,
and my life and work is here.

17:06.260 --> 17:08.900
So...it can be hard.

17:08.900 --> 17:14.860
Do you still love him?

17:14.860 --> 17:17.220
That s the thing -
love and loyalty are two different

17:17.220 --> 17:20.580
things, aren't they?

17:20.580 --> 17:27.740
Never gets any easier.

17:32.140 --> 17:40.060
Dad, I m home.

17:50.140 --> 17:53.100
Dad?

17:53.540 --> 17:56.100
What is it?

17:56.100 --> 17:59.180
I went to visit Cara...

17:59.180 --> 18:05.740
She s gone.

18:05.740 --> 18:12.980
Are we going to sit and wait
for Vanessa all night?

18:14.820 --> 18:21.300
That ll get infected.

18:24.580 --> 18:29.220
I just wanted a better
life for Ben and me...

18:29.220 --> 18:30.580
..to make some money.

18:30.580 --> 18:31.860
Yeah.

18:31.860 --> 18:39.700
That s all you cared about - money.

18:39.700 --> 18:42.220
When you have nothing else,
no family, yeah, it does

18:42.220 --> 18:46.740
matter, a hell of a lot!

18:46.740 --> 18:47.940
What are you talking about?

18:47.940 --> 18:48.980
You had a family.

18:48.980 --> 18:50.460
You had the boxing club, me.

18:50.460 --> 18:56.300
Bullshit!

18:56.300 --> 18:59.860
You gave Ben and Kieran
all the attention  cause they had

18:59.860 --> 19:01.540
talent.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.500
Are you jealous?

19:04.500 --> 19:05.540
Lee.

19:05.540 --> 19:10.380
I m a trainer.

19:10.380 --> 19:13.100
Obviously I'm gonna focus on them
that show most promise.

19:13.100 --> 19:17.900
You know...

19:17.900 --> 19:21.380
All the stuff a parent
is supposed to teach a

19:21.380 --> 19:25.500
kids, I taught Ben...

19:25.500 --> 19:29.620
Tying his shoelace,
riding a bike...

19:29.620 --> 19:32.500
..shoplifting...

19:32.500 --> 19:36.620
I tried to teach him
responsibility but...

19:36.620 --> 19:44.580
..problem was, nobody taught me.

19:50.340 --> 19:54.860
I can't bring him back
but I will end this.

19:54.860 --> 20:02.820
I promise.

20:48.660 --> 20:56.620
Pizza delivery.

20:57.980 --> 21:00.100
Better times ahead, right?

21:00.100 --> 21:03.060
I ll drink to that.

21:09.260 --> 21:10.380
You holding up OK?

21:10.380 --> 21:17.820
Ah, yeah, fine.

21:20.820 --> 21:26.060
There s a chance that
I could be Cara s father...

21:26.060 --> 21:28.820
What?

21:28.820 --> 21:32.820
I'm dead serious.

21:32.820 --> 21:40.780
Wow.

21:43.180 --> 21:47.740
Well, anyway...

21:47.740 --> 21:50.380
..she s gone off with Ryan, to
Ireland, according to her flatmate.

21:50.380 --> 21:53.420
And she's not answering my texts.

21:53.420 --> 21:54.420
So...

21:54.420 --> 21:55.580
Great.

21:55.580 --> 21:58.180
And you've told Ryan s
probation officer?

21:58.180 --> 21:59.300
No?

21:59.300 --> 22:00.580
Why?

22:00.580 --> 22:04.700
Why?

22:04.700 --> 22:07.100
I think Ryan has to deliver
this gun to Ireland.

22:07.100 --> 22:10.220
And if the police close
in on him he ll feel trapped.

22:10.220 --> 22:11.900
I mean, God knows what he'll do.

22:11.900 --> 22:16.380
Why?

22:16.380 --> 22:20.620
Is that what s really going on?

22:20.620 --> 22:24.980
What do you mean?

22:24.980 --> 22:27.380
Well, the fact that
you want to personally

22:27.380 --> 22:30.260
track them down, has that something
more to do with the fact

22:30.260 --> 22:31.700
that Ryan is with Cara
and

22:31.700 --> 22:32.740
not you?

22:32.740 --> 22:35.620
You re saying I m jealous of Ryan,
for taking Cara away from me?

22:35.620 --> 22:38.020
I m just saying that perhaps strong
feelings are clouding your

22:38.020 --> 22:39.060
judgment.

22:39.060 --> 22:40.980
Damn right strong feelings
are clouding my judgement.

22:40.980 --> 22:48.260
This is my family!

22:51.100 --> 22:57.780
Sorry.

23:00.140 --> 23:08.100
I m sorry...

23:13.940 --> 23:16.740
Don t give up.

23:16.740 --> 23:24.700
Keep texting her.

23:24.700 --> 23:25.740
Morning.

23:25.740 --> 23:27.860
Good morning.

23:27.860 --> 23:29.340
Dr Alexander....

23:29.340 --> 23:31.500
Yeah, call me Nikki.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.700
You know the ink-stained
blood found in the barn.

23:33.700 --> 23:36.540
Mm hmm.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.020
Well, I thought of an angle.

23:38.020 --> 23:39.700
Should I just run it by Jack?

23:39.700 --> 23:40.940
Sure.

23:40.940 --> 23:42.060
Yeah.

23:42.060 --> 23:49.660
I m sure it s OK.

24:23.540 --> 24:25.180
The towel from the barn
contained numerous

24:25.180 --> 24:26.380
samples of blood and saliva.

24:26.380 --> 24:27.420
All match Kieran Johnson.

24:27.420 --> 24:29.580
In addition, the fibres
from the towel match those

24:29.580 --> 24:31.020
that Simone found in Kieran's lungs.

24:31.020 --> 24:32.460
It was used to suffocate him?

24:32.460 --> 24:33.500
It's highly likely.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.900
Simone, how are you coming
along on the soil found

24:35.900 --> 24:36.940
in Lee Coogan's car?

24:36.940 --> 24:37.980
Yeah.

24:37.980 --> 24:39.020
It's in progress.

24:39.020 --> 24:42.420
But, I, uh, I had a look at the ink
traces on the dressing.

24:42.420 --> 24:43.580
What am I looking at?

24:43.580 --> 24:46.220
The components of tattoo ink
are split into the carrier and

24:46.220 --> 24:47.260
the pigment.

24:47.260 --> 24:49.180
Some artists make their own
personal pigment blends.

24:49.180 --> 24:51.820
The composition of this blend can
tell us a few things

24:51.820 --> 24:52.860
about our ink.

24:52.860 --> 24:54.100
Firstly, it's mineral based.

24:54.100 --> 24:56.500
Only 20% of tattoo inks
is still mineral based, most

24:56.500 --> 24:58.700
are organic.

24:58.700 --> 25:00.380
Secondly, it contains Cadmium
and Mercury Sulphide

25:00.380 --> 25:02.860
which are potentially carcinogenic.

25:02.860 --> 25:03.940
Cinnabar?

25:03.940 --> 25:06.660
Most artists have phased that out.

25:06.660 --> 25:08.340
Did you run that by a Chemist?

25:08.340 --> 25:12.180
I, uh, have a Masters
in Chemistry...

25:12.180 --> 25:14.100
This particular ink did not
even contain enough

25:14.100 --> 25:15.540
preservatives to stop
microorganisms from growing.

25:15.540 --> 25:16.580
Sloppy workmanship.

25:16.580 --> 25:17.620
And even worse.

25:17.620 --> 25:20.020
I found out the carrier
of this ink was alcoholic

25:20.020 --> 25:21.060
mouthwash.

25:21.060 --> 25:22.500
Normally you'd use
something like ethanol.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.660
All of this narrows
the blend down to a

25:24.660 --> 25:27.420
handful of London
underground based artists.

25:27.420 --> 25:31.260
I've got a few names
and addresses for you.

25:31.260 --> 25:35.220
OK, great, email them to me
and check them out.

25:35.220 --> 25:37.620
Er, I should probably go back
to analysing the soil

25:37.620 --> 25:38.820
from Lee Coogan's car, if

25:38.820 --> 25:40.580
that's OK?

25:40.580 --> 25:41.620
Yeah, yeah.

25:41.620 --> 25:43.580
Course.

25:43.580 --> 25:50.660
Jack, you mind coming along?

25:50.660 --> 25:51.660
You in a relationship?

25:51.660 --> 25:52.700
No.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.060
Lucky duck.

25:54.060 --> 25:57.940
How's it going with you and Simone?

25:57.940 --> 25:59.780
Pretty obvious, you're a couple.

25:59.780 --> 26:02.420
Going on two years now
and I still don't know how

26:02.420 --> 26:04.100
serious she is about it.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.540
She's going with you to Oz?

26:05.540 --> 26:06.580
Yes...

26:06.580 --> 26:12.580
But to be honest, I'm not sure that
will change anything.

26:18.300 --> 26:19.300
All right?

26:19.300 --> 26:20.340
Yeah.

26:20.340 --> 26:21.380
OK.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.780
So the only person to get
a recent Tattoo with

26:23.780 --> 26:24.820
that
ink composition is

26:24.820 --> 26:25.860
one Samuel Kovic.

26:25.860 --> 26:27.140
Works down the road.

26:27.140 --> 26:32.580
Then what are we waiting for?

26:32.580 --> 26:33.620
She's here!

26:33.620 --> 26:41.580
Get ready!

26:43.060 --> 26:51.020
This car wash is registered
to Vanessa Lloyd.

27:13.860 --> 27:15.300
Just give me two seconds here.

27:15.300 --> 27:21.820
Mm-hmm.

27:21.820 --> 27:22.820
Hello?

27:22.820 --> 27:30.780
Samuel Kovic?

27:36.300 --> 27:39.340
Nasty business, infected tattoos.

27:39.340 --> 27:41.380
Who are you?

27:41.380 --> 27:43.780
I'm DI Brodie,
Greater London Police.

27:43.780 --> 27:48.820
I'd like to ask you a few
questions, Mr Kovic.

27:48.820 --> 27:52.500
About what?

27:52.500 --> 27:56.060
I'm investigating the murders
of Ben Coogan and Kieran Johnson.

27:56.060 --> 27:57.140
Could we speak inside?

27:57.140 --> 28:02.020
I have nothing to say.

28:02.020 --> 28:03.740
Mr Kovic,

28:03.740 --> 28:07.740
DNA evidence places you near
the site of Ben Coogan's murder.

28:07.740 --> 28:10.260
What's going on here?

28:10.260 --> 28:11.540
You are?

28:11.540 --> 28:16.780
The owner of the property on which
you are currently trespassing.

28:16.780 --> 28:17.980
Well,

28:17.980 --> 28:19.940
in that case, Mr Kovic
will have to come

28:19.940 --> 28:21.060
down to the station.

28:21.060 --> 28:22.180
Do you have a warrant?

28:22.180 --> 28:23.220
Are you cautioning him?

28:23.220 --> 28:24.260
Arresting him?

28:24.260 --> 28:25.300
Then shove off.

28:25.300 --> 28:26.340
Mr Kovic.

28:26.340 --> 28:33.220
Can I see your right hand, please?

28:33.220 --> 28:36.100
Hello again.

28:36.100 --> 28:39.260
You like to leave a mark, don't you?

28:39.260 --> 28:43.220
In more ways than one.

28:43.220 --> 28:45.140
Jack, would you mind
examining Mr Kovic shoes?

28:45.140 --> 28:48.100
Love to.

29:11.260 --> 29:14.340
Vanessa Lloyd, owner of seven car
washes in the Metropolitan area.

29:14.340 --> 29:16.500
She has long been
rumoured to be the head

29:16.500 --> 29:17.940
of a fight club known
as

29:17.940 --> 29:20.820
Steel Knuckle.

29:20.820 --> 29:23.460
A fighter like Ben Coogan must have
been a valuable asset

29:23.460 --> 29:26.220
to Steel Knuckle.

29:26.220 --> 29:29.100
I got the impression that Ben's
ambitions lay in the world of

29:29.100 --> 29:30.140
legitimate boxing.

29:30.140 --> 29:31.420
That's where we saw him.

29:31.420 --> 29:36.140
Getting out of the bare knuckle
World though is not so easy.

29:36.140 --> 29:37.820
It's likely Ms Lloyd
arranged the fight

29:37.820 --> 29:40.500
between Kieran and Ben
four nights ago.

29:40.500 --> 29:43.460
During or after that fight,
Kieran dies, most likely

29:43.460 --> 29:51.100
suffocated, using the towel
recovered from the barn.

29:51.100 --> 29:55.740
I found lichen in the cleats of
Kovic's shoes it matches the balcony

29:55.740 --> 29:56.820
where Kieran's body fell.

29:56.820 --> 29:57.940
Great find.

29:57.940 --> 29:59.180
Footprint impressions
from the balcony

29:59.180 --> 30:07.140
also match Kovic's shoes.

30:08.380 --> 30:11.740
So Kovic carries the body to the top
of the building and drops it,

30:11.740 --> 30:13.140
presumably under orders from Lloyd.

30:13.140 --> 30:16.580
Did she have Kieran and Ben killed?

30:16.580 --> 30:20.180
Vanessa Lloyd is stonewalling us,
and Kovic will only admit to an

30:20.180 --> 30:23.620
altercation with Kieran.

30:23.620 --> 30:25.780
CPS have said to charge
Kovic with perverting the

30:25.780 --> 30:27.260
course of justice.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.980
He'll be remanded in custody while

30:28.980 --> 30:33.500
we look for more evidence
to charge him with murder.

30:33.500 --> 30:34.580
All right.

30:34.580 --> 30:36.780
Thank you, everyone.

30:36.780 --> 30:43.140
Oh, and Jack, I'm going to need
you to examine Kovic's flat.

31:59.780 --> 32:02.460
Cheers!

32:02.460 --> 32:04.380
So you're working
on a murder case now?

32:04.380 --> 32:07.660
I want all the gory details!

32:07.660 --> 32:08.900
Yeah, it's OK.

32:08.900 --> 32:10.980
Not really my thing.

32:10.980 --> 32:13.020
Could've fooled me.

32:13.020 --> 32:17.140
She always was a little
bit over-eager.

32:17.140 --> 32:19.300
Tell me about it - ask her to pick

32:19.300 --> 32:22.180
up a tin of tomatoes and she'll
bring back a week's shopping.

32:22.180 --> 32:23.220
Handy for you.

32:25.740 --> 32:26.780
Very funny.

32:26.780 --> 32:29.700
Maybe you can apply for a similar
job on permanent basis.

32:29.700 --> 32:31.420
She'd need a work visa for that.

32:31.420 --> 32:34.580
Work visa?

32:34.580 --> 32:36.260
Well, yes, she can't apply for a

32:36.260 --> 32:37.940
job in Australia unless she has one.

32:37.940 --> 32:38.980
A job?

32:38.980 --> 32:41.940
I thought you were going
to Australia on holiday?

32:44.260 --> 32:45.940
It won't be a holiday for me.

32:45.940 --> 32:52.020
I got on the New South
Wales Homicide Squad.

32:52.020 --> 32:58.820
I think I'd better
check on the tiramisu.

33:00.460 --> 33:01.900
Now it makes sense, you dragging

33:01.900 --> 33:04.940
your feet applying for a work visa.

33:04.940 --> 33:06.660
Babe, you know how close we are.

33:06.660 --> 33:09.060
I didn't want to just
spring it on her that

33:09.060 --> 33:11.020
I was permanently moving.

33:11.020 --> 33:12.140
Nah.

33:12.140 --> 33:14.540
All you want is a bit
of surf and Shiraz.

33:14.540 --> 33:17.420
Then, when your holiday visa is up,
you go back to London,

33:17.420 --> 33:19.340
and I go back to work in Sydney.

33:19.340 --> 33:20.380
That's nonsense!

33:20.380 --> 33:28.340
Then why don't you bloody apply?!

33:29.100 --> 33:30.740
PHONE RINGS Jack?

33:30.740 --> 33:33.140
I found a phone in a safe
inside Kovic's house.

33:33.140 --> 33:34.180
And?

33:34.180 --> 33:35.860
It's better if you come down here.

33:35.860 --> 33:38.820
I think...

33:40.540 --> 33:42.900
You'll have to excuse me
for doing a runner, Gloria.

33:42.900 --> 33:44.140
Duty calls.

33:44.140 --> 33:45.580
OK.

33:45.580 --> 33:47.100
Thanks for dinner, You're welcome.

33:50.860 --> 33:58.820
We need another bottle here, Gran.

34:00.140 --> 34:03.020
The footage had been deleted,
but I was able to retrieve it.

34:03.020 --> 34:05.660
It's Ben Coogan and Kieran Johnson
in a bare knuckle fight.

34:05.660 --> 34:07.620
Date and time match
the time Kieran died.

34:07.620 --> 34:08.620
Kieran looks drowsy.

34:08.620 --> 34:10.540
The sleeping pills.

34:14.540 --> 34:19.260
That towel looks like the one used
to asphyxiate Kieran Johnson.

34:19.260 --> 34:26.740
Is that Michelle Lafferty?

34:43.380 --> 34:45.540
Know what she was called
in her boxing days?

34:45.540 --> 34:46.740
The Manchester Maniac.

34:46.740 --> 34:49.340
My boys would still be alive
if it wasn't for you!

34:49.340 --> 34:56.820
That's so sweet.

34:56.900 --> 34:59.380
All you do is use people
then spit them out.

34:59.380 --> 35:02.460
Like you did me.

35:02.460 --> 35:06.060
Like you did Ben.

35:06.060 --> 35:09.460
Do something, stop her.

35:09.460 --> 35:10.500
Stop her!

35:10.500 --> 35:11.540
Michelle, Michelle, come down.

35:11.540 --> 35:17.580
This isn't going to solve anything.

35:18.980 --> 35:22.140
Please stop.

35:22.140 --> 35:27.020
Stop her.

35:27.020 --> 35:29.580
That's close enough.

35:29.580 --> 35:32.540
OK.

35:32.540 --> 35:38.100
Did Kieran want to prove
to you he was better than Ben?

35:38.100 --> 35:39.980
Ben was fast but Kieran
was stronger, bigger.

35:39.980 --> 35:42.100
He'd have killed him.

35:42.100 --> 35:43.820
I told Kieran to throw the fight.

35:43.820 --> 35:45.540
But he wouldn't.

35:45.540 --> 35:46.620
Come down, Michelle.

35:46.620 --> 35:49.500
We can talk about it.

35:49.500 --> 35:50.500
OK, don't.

35:50.500 --> 35:51.540
Don't, no.

35:51.540 --> 35:52.620
No.

35:52.620 --> 35:53.660
No!

35:57.300 --> 36:00.420
When Kieran came round he knew I'd
drugged him, said he saw Ben

36:00.420 --> 36:03.140
putting on loaded wraps,
and he was going to post it

36:03.140 --> 36:08.100
all online that night.

36:08.100 --> 36:12.740
Maybe it was all lies.

36:12.740 --> 36:15.220
I don't know.

36:15.220 --> 36:17.620
You killed Kieran...

36:17.620 --> 36:25.140
..and you let Ben die,
thinking he did it?!

36:25.140 --> 36:28.100
I couldn't lose Ben.

36:28.100 --> 36:34.580
I'm sorry.

36:34.580 --> 36:42.540
Get out!

37:03.940 --> 37:04.980
Son.

37:04.980 --> 37:11.220
It's the bank.

37:11.220 --> 37:15.940
Fraud alert.

37:15.940 --> 37:22.540
Tree Bark Cafe.

37:39.220 --> 37:40.380
Good to see you, Cara.

37:40.380 --> 37:42.420
Can I talk to you for a second?

37:42.420 --> 37:44.820
By the looks of you,
talking is the last thing

37:44.820 --> 37:46.620
you want to do to me.

37:46.620 --> 37:54.580
Give us one minute.

37:54.860 --> 37:56.460
Go on.

37:56.460 --> 38:04.420
Do your worst.

38:07.220 --> 38:13.500
Are you going to tell me
about the paternity tests?

38:20.740 --> 38:24.660
18 years ago, while you and
Aoife were going out...

38:24.660 --> 38:25.700
..she and I...

38:25.700 --> 38:29.780
..we...

38:29.780 --> 38:32.180
It only happened one time.

38:32.180 --> 38:38.900
And you let me go to prison for you,
knowing that you'd...

38:38.900 --> 38:41.500
And Cara?

38:41.500 --> 38:43.140
Are you telling me that she's...?

38:43.140 --> 38:49.980
I don't know yet.

39:01.220 --> 39:02.620
I'll explain everything on the bus.

39:02.620 --> 39:03.660
Let's go, Cara.

39:03.660 --> 39:04.700
Cara!

39:04.700 --> 39:05.740
Cara, don't believe him.

39:05.740 --> 39:07.420
Jack and I just had an argument.

39:07.420 --> 39:08.460
It happens.

39:08.460 --> 39:09.500
No big deal.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.700
No, no, no, no, no.

39:10.700 --> 39:12.540
More than an argument.

39:12.540 --> 39:16.380
It involves you.

39:16.380 --> 39:20.220
Check the bag.

39:20.220 --> 39:22.940
Check inside the bag.

39:22.940 --> 39:24.380
We don't have time for this!

39:24.380 --> 39:30.460
Come on!

39:38.060 --> 39:40.620
He's using you.

39:40.620 --> 39:42.700
He's using you.

39:42.700 --> 39:50.580
He is using you to transport
a gun to Ireland.

39:50.580 --> 39:53.780
Look Cara, I'm sorry...

39:53.780 --> 39:56.940
I was...

39:56.940 --> 39:59.820
I'm sorry.

39:59.820 --> 40:01.740
They'll catch you at the ferry.

40:01.740 --> 40:02.940
I'm not covering for you.

40:02.940 --> 40:04.420
You owe me!

40:04.420 --> 40:07.820
Now more than ever.

40:07.820 --> 40:10.580
I'll never stop owing you.

40:10.580 --> 40:13.420
But I'm not doing this anymore.

40:13.420 --> 40:15.420
We are done.

40:15.420 --> 40:17.140
I'm sorry.

40:17.140 --> 40:19.620
I trusted you, brother.

40:19.620 --> 40:27.580
Always.

40:33.980 --> 40:41.940
That summer, 18 years ago,
Ryan was away working

40:44.660 --> 40:51.740
on a construction job,
construction job in Birmingham.

40:51.740 --> 40:55.940
Birmingham, I think.

40:55.940 --> 41:00.660
Doesn't matter.

41:00.660 --> 41:08.620
Aoife and I spent a lot
of time together.

41:09.260 --> 41:16.700
I used to drive her to and from work
and sometimes we would

41:16.700 --> 41:24.660
get a drink together.

41:26.300 --> 41:32.700
I found her easy to talk to.

41:32.700 --> 41:35.780
Talk to.

41:35.780 --> 41:39.460
To open up?

41:39.460 --> 41:45.180
Open up.

41:45.180 --> 41:46.940
Then one night...

41:46.940 --> 41:50.740
We...

41:50.740 --> 41:53.700
We...

41:56.220 --> 42:04.180
It shouldn't have
happened - but it did.

42:14.580 --> 42:15.620
I don't know.

42:15.620 --> 42:20.660
I could be.

42:20.660 --> 42:23.380
As soon as I find out.

42:23.380 --> 42:26.700
Find out.

42:26.700 --> 42:32.660
I will tell you.

42:32.660 --> 42:37.220
I'm so sorry.

42:37.220 --> 42:43.340
So sorry that this has all been
so difficult for you.

42:43.340 --> 42:51.300
I feel like I've failed
you, and Ryan too.

42:52.060 --> 42:58.740
No.

43:14.140 --> 43:15.860
You and me...

43:15.860 --> 43:22.620
..we're connected.

43:22.620 --> 43:23.940
You and me.

43:23.940 --> 43:29.980
We're connected.

44:01.460 --> 44:03.580
Have you finished analysing
the soil from the footwell

44:03.580 --> 44:05.580
of Lee Coogan's car?

44:05.580 --> 44:07.940
I found a mix of riverine
and marine diatoms indicating

44:07.940 --> 44:09.660
an estuary environment.

44:09.660 --> 44:12.540
In addition, there was a mix of tile
and brick fragments, suggesting

44:12.540 --> 44:15.340
an urban construction site.

44:15.340 --> 44:17.540
Meaning Lee or whoever drove
the car was recently

44:17.540 --> 44:21.060
on a construction site near a river?

44:21.060 --> 44:23.900
I found a site located over a Thames
tributary, where the waterway

44:23.900 --> 44:25.340
is being re-routed.

44:25.340 --> 44:26.780
Could fit the bill.

44:26.780 --> 44:29.300
Well done.

44:29.300 --> 44:31.260
Shall I tell DI Brodie or will you?

44:31.260 --> 44:32.980
I already have....

44:32.980 --> 44:34.500
Let's go!

44:34.500 --> 44:35.860
Go?

44:35.860 --> 44:39.780
We'll need a sample from the site,
see if it matches this one.

44:39.780 --> 44:41.580
That's not really within my remit.

44:41.580 --> 44:43.740
Ah, come on, Dr Alexander.

44:43.740 --> 44:46.860
It's a chance to get the smell
of formalin out of your nose!

44:51.220 --> 44:55.100
All right, but can you please stop
calling me Dr Alexander?

44:55.100 --> 45:02.220
Deal.

45:10.820 --> 45:12.740
Michelle Lafferty mentioned that
Kieran claimed to have

45:12.740 --> 45:16.660
footage incriminating Ben.

45:16.660 --> 45:22.100
Maybe he's got more footage hidden
in his daughter's toys.

45:22.100 --> 45:24.060
Yeah.

45:24.060 --> 45:28.740
Great, thanks, Jack.

45:28.740 --> 45:34.860
We need 8-10 samples that show
the spread of building materials.

45:34.860 --> 45:41.380
You're the boss.

45:42.660 --> 45:47.380
Here you go.

45:47.380 --> 45:49.300
You make an excellent assistant.

45:49.300 --> 45:51.940
I'll bare that in mind
in case I need a reference.

45:51.940 --> 45:54.180
Bob, crane two is down again.

45:54.180 --> 45:58.260
There's a delay of about...

45:58.260 --> 46:06.220
Stop, police!

46:12.180 --> 46:14.460
Thanks.

46:14.460 --> 46:22.420
That's OK.

46:23.100 --> 46:24.540
Take a step back there, Emily.

46:24.540 --> 46:26.140
That's it.

46:26.140 --> 46:28.540
What does that do?

46:28.540 --> 46:31.420
It tells me if any of your teddies
have anything inside them,

46:31.420 --> 46:32.860
anything that might make them sick.

46:32.860 --> 46:33.900
Like Mr Maddington?

46:33.900 --> 46:39.860
That's right.

46:47.340 --> 46:48.700
DI Brodie?

46:48.700 --> 46:49.740
Yes.

46:49.740 --> 46:50.780
Right.

46:50.780 --> 46:55.060
OK.

46:55.060 --> 46:57.100
I'd get here quick if I were you.

46:57.100 --> 46:58.140
OK.

46:58.140 --> 47:00.300
Bye.

47:00.300 --> 47:03.060
Emily.

47:03.060 --> 47:07.540
I need you to stay
in this room for me.

47:07.540 --> 47:10.180
If you hear loud noises,
don't come out, OK?

47:10.180 --> 47:11.860
Look after these teddies for me, OK?

47:11.860 --> 47:16.540
Good girl.

47:16.540 --> 47:19.460
But...

47:19.460 --> 47:20.620
we can't just...

47:20.620 --> 47:22.300
Get yours and Emily's
passports - now.

47:22.300 --> 47:23.340
Right now.

47:23.340 --> 47:24.380
Noah, that's crazy!

47:24.380 --> 47:26.780
I said I'd give you
and Emily a new life.

47:26.780 --> 47:27.980
We're doing it now, OK?

47:27.980 --> 47:30.140
Noah, I can't just drag Emily
off to who-knows-where!

47:30.140 --> 47:32.180
Just get the passports!

47:32.180 --> 47:33.220
What's he doing here?!

47:33.220 --> 47:34.420
There's nowhere to run, Noah.

47:34.420 --> 47:41.860
Get out.

47:41.860 --> 47:43.980
I don't want to hurt anyone!

47:43.980 --> 47:46.660
But I'm not going back inside.

47:46.660 --> 47:49.260
I get it.

47:49.260 --> 47:51.660
Kieran got you on your feet
after prison, didn't he?

47:51.660 --> 47:52.860
Never stopped believing in you.

47:52.860 --> 47:54.340
And how do you repay him?

47:54.340 --> 47:57.620
Sleep with his wife,
plot to take his money.

47:57.620 --> 48:00.660
I'm not judging you, I'm not.

48:00.660 --> 48:02.260
I'm no better.

48:02.260 --> 48:07.980
In fact, I might be worse.

48:07.980 --> 48:11.500
I slept with my
brother's girlfriend.

48:11.500 --> 48:14.340
Maybe even had a child with her.

48:14.340 --> 48:18.660
And I never told him.

48:18.660 --> 48:22.100
It's the guilt, isn't it?

48:22.100 --> 48:24.820
It eats you up.

48:24.820 --> 48:28.820
You'd do anything
to make it go away.

48:28.820 --> 48:31.220
Me, I went further and further
till I realised, nothing

48:31.220 --> 48:39.180
would ever be enough.

48:39.780 --> 48:41.700
How did you find out
about Steel Knuckle?

48:41.700 --> 48:42.740
Had Kieran told you?

48:42.740 --> 48:43.780
Yeah.

48:43.780 --> 48:45.460
I went to see a few fights.

48:45.460 --> 48:47.860
And you thought his death might
have something to do

48:47.860 --> 48:49.260
with the bare knuckle fights?

48:49.260 --> 48:51.340
So you went to Ben
Coogan's last match.

48:51.340 --> 48:54.300
Did he recognise you in the crowd?

49:05.380 --> 49:07.020
Yeah.

49:07.020 --> 49:08.220
He ran out.

49:08.220 --> 49:11.940
I found him standing there, weeping.

49:11.940 --> 49:14.340
Said he hadn't meant
to hit my brother so hard,

49:14.340 --> 49:17.620
said Lee loaded the wraps.

49:17.620 --> 49:24.580
I don't know what he wanted from me
- forgiveness, absolution...

49:24.580 --> 49:28.700
That's sure as hell weren't
what he was getting from my eyes.

49:28.700 --> 49:31.220
He ran off across a field...

49:31.220 --> 49:34.100
I hot wired an old banger...

49:34.100 --> 49:38.900
I never thougt I'd
find him in the...

49:38.900 --> 49:40.300
..dark...

49:40.300 --> 49:45.500
..then, I saw him...

49:45.500 --> 49:47.060
Outside

49:47.060 --> 49:48.140
that warehouse...

49:48.140 --> 49:49.420
I don't regret it.

49:49.420 --> 49:50.620
I got justice for Kieran.

49:50.620 --> 49:56.340
I'm glad Ben's dead.

49:56.340 --> 49:58.900
You didn't get justice for Kieran.

49:58.900 --> 50:05.180
Ben didn't kill him.

50:05.180 --> 50:06.540
That's bollocks!

50:06.540 --> 50:08.220
Michelle Lafferty confessed
to having suffocated him,

50:08.220 --> 50:09.660
then Kovic disposed of his body.

50:09.660 --> 50:13.060
She did it to protect Ben.

50:13.060 --> 50:15.260
You're lying.

50:15.260 --> 50:16.300
You're lying.

50:16.300 --> 50:19.620
I'm not lying.

50:19.620 --> 50:21.540
Ben thought he'd killed
him, but he hadn't.

50:21.540 --> 50:24.900
You murdered an innocent man.

50:24.900 --> 50:25.940
No...

50:25.940 --> 50:31.340
No, it can't be...

50:31.340 --> 50:32.340
Sorry, mate.

50:32.340 --> 50:35.580
Forensics proved it.

50:35.580 --> 50:41.780
Kieran died from suffocation,
not from the blows given by Ben.

51:39.180 --> 51:40.300
Hi.

51:40.300 --> 51:41.340
Hi.

51:41.340 --> 51:46.620
Any news from Cara?

51:46.620 --> 51:47.660
Cara...

51:47.660 --> 51:49.420
Cara's off to Ireland, on her own.

51:49.420 --> 51:51.300
Ryan is...

51:51.300 --> 51:54.860
I don't know where Ryan is.

51:54.860 --> 51:55.900
You were right.

51:55.900 --> 51:57.140
About what?

51:57.140 --> 51:59.380
I was jealous of Ryan.

51:59.380 --> 52:01.340
I didn't want him
to be Cara's father.

52:01.340 --> 52:03.580
I wanted it to be me.

52:03.580 --> 52:04.700
But...?

52:04.700 --> 52:06.180
I sent off the paternity test.

52:06.180 --> 52:14.140
Just got the results.

52:16.220 --> 52:19.100
When the possibility first came up,
that I might be Cara's father...

52:19.100 --> 52:21.740
..I was shaking in my boots!

52:21.740 --> 52:25.060
Then I got to know her,
realised how much we had in common.

52:25.060 --> 52:27.980
And now...

52:27.980 --> 52:32.460
I guess it feels like a door was
opened, then abruptly shut forever.

52:32.460 --> 52:38.100
You know?

52:38.100 --> 52:45.060
I think that door stays open
as long as you want it to.

52:45.060 --> 52:52.500
I need to make some serious
changes to my life.

52:53.580 --> 52:54.820
Maybe it's time.

52:54.820 --> 53:02.780
For both of us.

53:07.500 --> 53:13.100
Hey.

53:13.100 --> 53:14.460
Well, guess it's goodbye then.

53:14.460 --> 53:17.340
Thank you again for all your work
and for your quick thinking

53:17.340 --> 53:18.380
at the building site.

53:18.380 --> 53:19.420
I owe you.

53:19.420 --> 53:21.500
Nah, you don't.

53:21.500 --> 53:23.180
Fancy joining us
for a drink tonight?

53:23.180 --> 53:24.220
Lisa's making sushi tonight.

53:24.220 --> 53:28.020
She'll kill me if I'm late.

53:28.020 --> 53:30.180
Simone, you played such
an important role in helping

53:30.180 --> 53:35.060
us to solve this case.

53:35.060 --> 53:38.300
Any forensic ecologist would have
arrived at the same conclusions.

53:38.300 --> 53:39.700
Nah, don't believe that.

53:39.700 --> 53:42.100
In fact, we were thinking you should
probably stick around,

53:42.100 --> 53:45.820
you know, permanently.

53:45.820 --> 53:49.740
I belong in the safety of the lab
reconstructing bronze-age habitats.

53:49.740 --> 53:50.780
I don't know.

53:50.780 --> 53:52.260
I think you're like us.

53:52.260 --> 53:53.940
You want to make a difference.

53:53.940 --> 54:00.220
I'm flattered, but...

54:00.220 --> 54:08.180
..I can't.

54:09.100 --> 54:11.740
Well, if you change your mind
about that drink, I'll text

54:11.740 --> 54:14.820
you the name of the
place we're going to.

54:14.820 --> 54:17.780
Cool.

54:29.300 --> 54:30.660
You almost got killed!

54:30.660 --> 54:32.460
Hardly.

54:32.460 --> 54:39.260
Chocolate?

54:39.260 --> 54:40.860
We solved the case today.

54:40.860 --> 54:43.900
So why don't you look happier?

54:43.900 --> 54:48.860
I don't know...

54:48.860 --> 54:52.020
I guess I didn't want it to end.

54:52.020 --> 54:54.180
Simi, I've spent so many
years watching you go

54:54.180 --> 54:56.380
from one thing to another,
never really pushing

54:56.380 --> 55:02.020
for promotions, not really knowing
what you're looking for.

55:02.020 --> 55:06.540
Sounds like you've
found the right one.

55:06.540 --> 55:12.660
I'm moving to Sydney.

55:12.660 --> 55:15.300
When you were small,
you'd sometimes come

55:15.300 --> 55:20.180
to me with your problems.

55:20.180 --> 55:23.780
"Gran, should I go for the milkshake
or the chocolate cone?"

55:23.780 --> 55:26.420
"Shall I go for the blue
shoes or the brown ones?"

55:26.420 --> 55:28.580
And you always helped me
make the right choice.

55:28.580 --> 55:30.540
No.

55:30.540 --> 55:34.060
In every case, you had
already made up your mind.

55:34.060 --> 55:37.700
You just needed me to tell
you which one was the right one.

55:37.700 --> 55:45.660
Simi, I'm here to tell you -
it is the right one.

56:45.060 --> 56:46.220
# I sit and wait.

56:46.220 --> 56:47.900
# Does an angel,
Contemplate my fate?

56:47.900 --> 56:49.100
# And do they know.

56:49.100 --> 56:51.740
# The places where we go
When we're grey and old.

56:51.740 --> 56:52.940
# Cos I've been told.

56:52.940 --> 56:53.980
# That salvation.

56:53.980 --> 56:59.860
# Let's their wings unfold.

56:59.860 --> 57:03.660
# So when I'm lying in my bed.

57:03.660 --> 57:10.380
# Thoughts running through my head.

57:10.380 --> 57:12.260
# And I feel that love is dead.

57:12.260 --> 57:15.020
# I'm loving angels instead.

57:15.020 --> 57:19.420
# And through it all.

57:19.420 --> 57:21.340
# He offers me protection.

57:21.340 --> 57:24.500
# A lot of love and affection.

57:24.500 --> 57:29.340
# Whether I'm right or wrong.

57:29.340 --> 57:31.660
# And down the water fall.

57:31.660 --> 57:34.100
# Wherever it may take me.

57:34.100 --> 57:37.260
# I know that life won't break me.

57:37.260 --> 57:41.260
# When I come to call.

57:41.260 --> 57:49.220
# He won't forsake me I'm
loving angels instead.#
